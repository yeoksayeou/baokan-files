New Youth with Lofty Aspirations

    "Listening to the Party is not an empty slogan, it must be seen in practical action. If the Party needs me to stay in the countryside, I should resolutely stay in the countryside under any circumstances, and overcome any difficulties. ...If you only look to the future and are unwilling to do what needs to be done most urgently now, such ideals are just empty talk and will not become reality."
        Xing Yanzi, Captain of the "Swallow Shock Brigade," Dazhongzhuang Commune, Hangu City, Hebei Province

    "I feel that what I am doing is beneficial to the Party, beneficial to the 650 million people, and beneficial to socialist construction. If some people call this 'stupid,' I am willing to be such a 'fool,' and I will continue to be 'foolish,' to be a 'fool' that is beneficial to the people, and not be a 'clever person' who is detrimental to the people."
        Zhu Yuqi, Captain of the Youth Shock Brigade, Zhangqiao Commune, Pudong County, Shanghai

    "The countryside is vast and full of opportunities, laying out a broad path for all ambitious young people. If youth could be had a hundred times, I would be willing to dedicate it all to the great cause of building the countryside!"
        Lu Genze, Member of Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji County, Jilin

    "What the Party needs are young people with communist consciousness. We should resolutely obey the Party's needs and always put collective interests above personal interests. As long as one is alive, one should always work for the collective. Wherever the Party needs us, we will go."
           Wang Peizhen, Member of Tuanbowa People's Commune, Jinghai County, Tianjin

    "The countryside is a university, and there is profound knowledge to be learned from farming. I am willing to study in the rural university forever, to be a 'little student' who is both red and expert, to build a happy homeland with my own hands, and to be the first generation of conscious and cultured new-type farmers in New China."
        Zhang Shilan, Youth Technical Captain, Xiaoguang Brigade, Mihe Commune, Yidu County, Shandong

    "I feel that it is most meaningful for a person to spend their life in struggle. In the future, when I am old and gray, when I recall my past, I will not have wasted my years, nor been mediocre. My life will have been closely linked with socialist and communist construction. In the construction of the entire communist edifice, I will have laid my own brick and tile. That will be my greatest happiness!"
        Lu Meiying, Member of Jinqiao Commune, Pudong County, Shanghai

    新青年壮志凌云
    “听党的话，不是空洞的口号，要看实际行动。党需要自己留在农村，无论在什么情况下也应该坚决留在农村，有了困难，应该坚决克服。……如果眼睛只望着将来，不愿意做当前最需要做的事情，那样的理想只是空谈而已，不会成为现实。”
    河北汉沽市大钟庄公社“燕子突击队”队长　邢燕子
    “我觉得，我干的事情是对党有利的，对六亿五千万人民有利的，对社会主义建设有利的。如果这被有些人称为‘傻瓜’，我是愿意做这样的‘傻瓜’的，并且还要继续‘傻’下去，做一个有利于人民的‘傻瓜’，而不做对于人民不利的‘聪明人’。”
        上海浦东县张桥公社青年突击队队长　朱玉琪
    “农村这块土地天高水长，在一切有志气的年轻人面前铺下了宽广的道路。如果青春能有一百次，我愿意都献给建设农村的伟大事业！”
      吉林延吉县东盛人民公社社员　吕根泽
    “党需要的是有共产主义觉悟的青年，我们应该做到坚决服从党的需要，任何时候，都把集体利益放在个人利益之上，人活着，一辈子都应该处处为集体，党需要我们到哪里，就到哪里。”
           天津静海县团泊洼人民公社社员　王培珍
    “农村是一所大学，庄稼活的学问深着哪，我愿意永远在农村大学里学习，当一名又红又专的小学生，用自己的双手建设幸福的家园，做新中国第一代有觉悟有文化的新型农民。”
        山东益都县弥河公社晓光大队青年技术队长　张世兰
    “我觉得一个人只有在战斗中度过自己的一生，才最有意义。将来，当我满头白发的时候，回忆起自己的过去，不曾虚度年华，不是碌碌无为，自己的一生是紧紧和社会主义、共产主义建设结合在一起的，在整个共产主义大厦的建设中有自己所砌的一砖一瓦，那将是我的最大幸福！”　上海浦东县金桥公社社员　吕美英
