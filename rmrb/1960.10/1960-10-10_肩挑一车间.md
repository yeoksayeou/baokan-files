	Carrying a Workshop on One's Shoulders
	Hammer, file, and large pliers… carrying a workshop on one's shoulders, repairing machinery wherever it is, we workers are busy day and night in the fields. Not afraid of the scorching sun, not caring if the rain soaks our clothes, looking at the harvest fruits in hand, the will to support agriculture is as firm as steel.

    肩挑一车间
    国翰鎯头、锉刀加大钳……肩挑一个车间，哪里有机器就到哪里修检，我们工人日夜奔忙在田间。不怕烈日晒着咱，哪管大雨淋湿了衣衫，看着到手的丰收果，支援农业的意志如钢坚。
