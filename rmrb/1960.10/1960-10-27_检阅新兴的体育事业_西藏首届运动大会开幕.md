Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 25th: The opening ceremony of the first sports meet in Tibet was held on the 23rd at the Lhasa Stadium. This sports meet is a grand review of the emerging sports undertaking in Tibet after the democratic reform. The sports meet includes six major events: basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, shooting, and track and field. More than 900 athletes from various ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, and Hui, from eleven delegations from all over Tibet participated in the competition.

Zhou Ren Shan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches. More than 5,000 Lhasa citizens watched the opening ceremony.

At the opening ceremony, athletes of all ethnic groups carried the emblem of the conference, waved colorful flags, and marched in neat steps, full of spirit, past the rostrum. One thousand children from Lhasa performed group exercises and formed patterns and characters of "Long Live the General Line," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," and "Long Live the Three Red Banners" at the opening ceremony.

Under the care of the Party, mass sports activities in Tibet are gradually developing. The sports activities that have been carried out in various regions include basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, track and field, single bars, double bars, wooden horses, tug-of-war, and calisthenics, as well as traditional ethnic sports activities of the Tibetan people, such as horse racing, archery, long-distance running, wrestling, and stone throwing. Participants in these sports activities include government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, students, and emancipated farmers and herdsmen. Many people have broken the notion that the high altitude and thin air of the plateau are not suitable for sports activities, and they persist in exercising to strengthen their physique. In the Shigatse Special District, which is 3,800 meters above sea level, and the Nagqu Special District, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, sports activities in government agencies and military units are well developed. The cadres of the Nagqu Sub-Committee have always insisted on doing calisthenics and engaging in various ball games. Cadres living in Pari, the world's highest city at the top of the Himalayas, also persist in exercising in the wind and snow. After participating in sports activities, many cadres and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are in high spirits and their bodies are healthier than before.

    西藏首届运动大会开幕
    新华社拉萨25日电　西藏第一届体育运动大会23日在拉萨体育场举行开幕式。这次运动大会是西藏地区民主改革后新兴的体育事业的大检阅。运动大会包括篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球、射击和田径六大项目，有来自西藏各地的十一个代表队、九百多名藏、汉、回等各族健儿参加比赛。
    中共西藏工委副书记周仁山、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美参加了开幕式，并且讲了话。五千多拉萨市民观看了开幕式。
    在开幕式上，各族运动员抬着大会会徽，打着彩旗，踏着整齐的步伐，精神饱满地通过主席台前。一千名拉萨市少年儿童在开幕式上表演了团体操和总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗万岁的图案字样。
    在党的关怀下，西藏地区的群众性体育活动正逐步开展起来。各地区已开展的体育活动项目，包括篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球、田径赛、单扛、双扛、木马、拔河、广播体操，以及西藏人民传统的民族体育活动，如跑马、射箭、长跑、?跤和丢石等。参加这些体育活动的，有机关干部、解放军官兵、工人、学生和翻身农、牧民等。许多人打破了高原地势高峻，空气稀薄，不适于体育活动的说法，坚持锻炼身体，增强体质。在拔海三千八百米的日喀则专区和拔海四千米以上的那曲专区，机关、部队的体育活动开展得很好。那曲分工委的干部们一直坚持作广播操和进行各种球类运动。生活在喜马拉雅山顶部——世界高城帕里的干部们也在漫天的风雪里坚持锻炼。许多干部和解放军官兵参加体育活动以后，精神焕发，身体也比过去健康了。
