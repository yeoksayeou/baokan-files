Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Second Workers' Amateur Art Creation Exhibition opened today at the Beijing Municipal Laboring People's Cultural Palace. This exhibition is sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese Artists Association in order to promote workers' amateur art activities to better serve socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to further popularize and improve workers' amateur art creation.

　　Among the more than 600 works exhibited this time, there are more than ten categories of paintings, including propaganda posters, New Year pictures, traditional Chinese paintings, prints, cartoons, comic strips, watercolor paintings, oil paintings, sketches, quick sketches, paper cuttings, and sculptures. The contents of these works are rich and colorful, with a strong sense of the times. They vividly express the Chinese working class's love for the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao; praise the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the three red banners; reflect the ever-changing face of China's socialist construction and the working class's spirit of hard work and striving for progress in socialist construction; and expose the aggressive nature of imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism.

　　Many professional artists have given high praise to the works in this exhibition. They believe that the works exhibited this time, compared with the works of the first Workers' Amateur Art Creation Exhibition held in 1955, have greatly improved in terms of political and ideological level and artistic level. Some works show the creativity of workers in art, especially traditional Chinese paintings and paper-cuts, which inherit and develop the excellent artistic forms of the nation and the people. They have achieved a considerable degree of maturity in using traditional brush and ink techniques to depict the new real life, and have a strong national character; many works have successfully used the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

    第二届工人业余美术创作展览会展出
    新华社7日讯　第二届工人业余美术创作展览会今天开始在北京市劳动人民文化宫展出。这是中华全国总工会和中国美术家协会为了促进工人业余美术活动更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，并且进一步普及和提高工人业余美术创作而举办的。
    这次展出的六百多件作品中，有宣传画、年画、国画、版画、漫画、连环画、水彩画、油画、素描、速写、剪纸、雕塑等十多个画种。这些作品的内容丰富多彩，具有强烈的时代气息。它们生动地表现了我国工人阶级对党和伟大领袖毛主席的热爱；歌颂了党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗；反映了我国社会主义建设日新月异的面貌和工人阶级在社会主义建设中艰苦劳动、发愤图强的精神面貌；揭露了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的侵略本质。
    许多专业美术家对这个展览会的作品给了很高的评价。他们认为，这次展出的作品比起1955年举行的第一届工人业余美术创作展览会的作品来，不论政治思想水平或艺术水平都有很大的提高，好些作品表现了工人在艺术上的创造性，尤其是国画、剪纸，继承和发展了民族民间的优秀艺术形式，在运用传统的笔墨手法来描绘新的现实生活方面达到了相当成熟的程度，具有浓郁的民族特色；许多作品成功地运用了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法。
