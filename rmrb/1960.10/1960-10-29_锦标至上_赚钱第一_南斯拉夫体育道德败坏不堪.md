Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, Belgrade Dispatch: Currently, buying and selling athletes, championshipism, and a lack of sportsmanship are widespread in Yugoslav sports circles. This was revealed in an article published in the Yugoslav “Youth Daily” on October 19th.

The article admitted: Commercialization in sports, organized buying and selling of athletes, frequent large-scale smuggling, impolite behavior inside and outside sports fields, and a lack of moral behavior, etc., “not only appear in football and boxing, but also exist in basketball, handball, volleyball, water polo, and other sports.”

The article mentioned a shocking incident that occurred in Maribor, Yugoslavia, which was reported by the Associated Press. According to reports, in July of this year, the local "Guardian" football team, in order to win the game against the "Karlovac" team, actually put poison in the opponent's food, resulting in the poisoning of all the opponents. The article had to admit that this incident "more clearly confirmed that some sports workers have begun to become criminal offenders."

The article also revealed that the staff of a certain railway workers’ football club management office attempted to bribe the members of the "Odrelda" team in order to make the other party deliberately lose to them.

Because a lucky athlete can get high "regular" and "temporary" bonuses, the article admitted: such a football player can "make more money" than an engineer in a steel factory. The article also admitted that "championshipism" has become a "dominant view" in Yugoslav sports circles. It said: "The principle of 'it is important to get first' often makes people subordinate everything to it."

    锦标至上　赚钱第一
    南斯拉夫体育道德败坏不堪
    新华社26日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：目前，在南斯拉夫的体育界中普遍存在着买卖运动员、锦标主义、缺乏体育道德的现象。这是南斯拉夫“青年报”10月19日刊登的一篇文章中透露的。
    文章中承认：体育运动中的商业化、组织买卖运动员、经常大规模的走私、运动场内外的不礼貌和缺乏道德的行为等等，“不仅出现在足球、拳击中，而且还存在于篮球、手球、排球、水球和其他运动中”。
    这篇文章提到了美联社曾经报道过的在南斯拉夫的马里博发生的一桩骇人听闻的事件。据报道，今年7月间，当地的“卫者”足球队在同“卡尔洛瓦茨”队进行比赛前，为了使自己获胜，竟在对方的食物中放下毒药，结果使对手们全部中毒。这篇文章不得不承认，这一事件“更明显地证实了某些体育工作者已开始变为刑事罪犯”。
    文章还透露，某铁路工人足球俱乐部管理处的工作人员企图收买“奥德雷达”队的队员，以便叫对方故意输给自己。
    由于当一个走运的运动员可以拿到高额的“定期”和“临时”奖金，这篇文章承认：当这样一个足球队员比当钢铁厂的工程师“更能赚钱”。文章还承认，“锦标主义”在南斯拉夫体育界中成了一种“占优势的看法”。它说：“‘重要的是获得第一’的这个原则，往往使人们的一切都从属于它”。
