Xinhua News Agency, 14th, New York: After the UN General Assembly plenary meeting concluded its discussion on the agenda item proposed by the Soviet Union regarding the independence of colonial countries and peoples on the morning of the 13th, it proceeded to arrange the discussion of the Soviet-proposed topic: "The threat to universal peace caused by the aggressive actions of the United States against the Soviet Union." The United States insisted on handing this issue over to the Political Committee for debate. Disregarding the opposition of representatives from socialist countries, the United Nations once again succumbed to the will of the United States, rejecting the Soviet proposal to discuss this important topic at the General Assembly plenary meeting and instead handing the issue over to the Political Committee for discussion.

    Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev spoke first. He said that everyone knows that the US authorities have repeatedly sent their spy planes to intrude into Soviet airspace. US President Eisenhower not only did not apologize to our country for this blatant act of aggression, but even declared that such flights were US policy. He pointed out that the US's actions have had a fatal impact on the entire international situation, breeding the threat of infinite disaster. The Soviet government believes that the US aggressive actions against the Soviet Union must be discussed directly at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting.

    He said that the Soviet Union submitted this issue to the General Assembly for discussion because the United States has listed practices that violate international law as its right. The aggressive flights of US aircraft not only violated our sovereignty but also violated the sovereignty of a series of other countries. If such actions by aggressors are not completely and thoroughly stopped, if they are not condemned, it will create the impression that the General Assembly approves of such actions by the US, thereby encouraging it to continue to take such aggressive actions.

    Khrushchev said that sending troops into the territory of other countries, or sending aircraft with aggressive intentions, is a military invasion by one country against another. The fact of the aggressive intrusion of US aircraft into Soviet territory must be evaluated in this way.

    Khrushchev added that the Soviet government has made every effort to avoid further tensions in Soviet-US relations. If the US government declares at the United Nations General Assembly that it regrets the actions of aggression against the Soviet Union and other countries, and guarantees that the US government will strictly abide by the principles of international law and respect the sovereignty of the Soviet Union and all other countries in the future, then we would consider such a guarantee to be an admission by the US that it was wrong on this issue, and we would no longer insist on discussing this issue. If the US government does not condemn the practice of sending its spy planes to the Soviet Union and other countries, the United Nations should condemn such aggressive actions extremely severely, because this is a completely unprecedented action taken by a major power against other countries, and this action breeds the most serious consequences for universal peace and the security of all peoples. He said that this policy of the United States must be condemned and stopped, and such provocative incidents must not be allowed to bring the world to the brink of war.

    He concluded by saying that the Soviet government hopes that the United Nations will not fail the hopes of the people of all countries, and will become a solemn tool for strengthening peace and a loyal defender of the sovereignty of all countries.

    US Representative Wadsworth disregarded the facts that US President Eisenhower had personally admitted that sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union was the established policy of the US, and that the US was continuing to do so, and shamelessly denied that the Soviet Union's accusations of US aggression were "unfounded" and "contrary to the facts." He also quibbled that Eisenhower had not issued a threat to continue spy flights, but only said that "the United States will not evade its responsibility to prevent surprise attacks." Wadsworth also trotted out the absurd decision made by the Security Council on the US aircraft intrusion into the Soviet Union, under US manipulation, to defend his shameless lies.

    Wadsworth even openly acted like a rogue at the meeting, attempting to counter-attack, falsely accusing the Soviet Union of proposing this motion condemning US aggression in order to "evade" the Soviet Union's "responsibility for shooting down the US RB-47 aircraft over the high seas."

    Wadsworth tried to belittle the importance of this topic. He nonsensically claimed that the Soviet proposal was not a "general accusation" but "only an accusation based on two specific incidents," using this as a "reason" to oppose discussing the topic at the General Assembly plenary meeting.

    Next, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David spoke. He firmly refuted the US delegation's attempt to obstruct the discussion of the US aggression against the Soviet Union at the General Assembly. He said that it would be wrong to think that this issue only involves relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Under the current circumstances, the aggressive actions of US military aircraft are a serious danger to the entire world. He demanded that the US government's adventurous policy be condemned, because this policy infringes upon the vital interests of peace-loving people all over the world. The plenary meeting adjourned after David's speech.

    Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki spoke first at the afternoon plenary meeting. He emphasized that the topic of the threat to universal peace caused by US aggression against the Soviet Union should be discussed at the General Assembly plenary meeting as an extremely important and urgent issue.

    Next, Khrushchev exercised his right of reply and spoke again, refuting the US representative's shameless denial of US aggression against the Soviet Union. When Khrushchev spoke about the US representative repeatedly emphasizing that the Security Council had twice refused to recognize the legality of the Soviet Union's accusations of US aggression, and using this as a reason to refuse to discuss the issue at the United Nations General Assembly, he pointed out that it was precisely because of this situation in the Security Council that the Soviet Union was now raising this issue at the United Nations General Assembly. Khrushchev said that the Security Council was worse than a spittoon. He also said that the US and the United Nations were the same thing, and that the United Nations was a branch of the US State Department.

    Khrushchev condemned Wadsworth for lying about the RB-47 aircraft incident. Wadsworth stubbornly insisted that this spy plane that had intruded into Soviet airspace and been shot down was only flying in the "high seas," and clamored for an international court to arbitrate. Khrushchev refuted this, saying that Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky was the judge. If someone breaks in, the perpetrator will definitely be crushed. This is the verdict of the Soviet court, and there cannot be another court.

    When Khrushchev spoke about the US representative's saying that the U-2 aircraft incident was merely an excuse used by the Soviet Union to sabotage the summit meeting, he said, "Look, the pot is calling the kettle black." He said that the US President, the State Department, and the Pentagon were all preparing for the collapse of the summit meeting.

    Khrushchev continued by saying, what is the value of disarmament negotiations if the US engages in war provocations while negotiating? He said that if the General Assembly recognizes that the US has the right to engage in such provocative flights, then our rights must also be recognized. The Soviet Union will shoot down all aircraft engaged in such flights and attack the foreign bases from which these aircraft take off. The Soviet Union will not kneel under the oppression of others. He also said to the representatives of the imperialist countries that if you want war, then go ahead and provoke it. As long as you are determined, you will get war. The Soviet Union will defeat the aggressors miserably. He added that it is you who are forcing us to retaliate. Every country has the right to an eye for an eye.

    Khrushchev also spoke about how, before the United Nations General Assembly convened, the Soviet Union discovered that the US had planned to send another aircraft to intrude into the Soviet Union at an altitude of 75,000 meters, and that the US had abandoned this plan only because the Soviet Union had detected it. He also condemned the North Atlantic aggressive group for planning exercises on the Soviet border. Khrushchev pointed out that Soviet domestic defense is in a state of alert, ready to crush enemy aggression at any time. Khrushchev also spoke about how, when he was traveling to New York on the "Baltika" postal ship, US aircraft and submarines engaged in provocations. He said, do you want to intimidate us? Do you want to sink our ship? Fine, if I sink to the bottom of the sea, I will drag you down with me.

    Khrushchev finally emphasized once again that the issue of disarmament must be resolved quickly. He read out the Soviet proposal submitted to the Political Committee for discussion: "Suggestions on the problem of disarmament and the situation resulting from the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 20, 1959 on this question." This proposal reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, called on governments to make every effort to resolve the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, and to draft and conclude a disarmament treaty as soon as possible. The proposal also reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal to reorganize the structure of the United Nations Secretariat and the Security Council, so that all three groups of countries (socialist countries, countries joining the Western countries group, and neutral countries) have equal representation in these institutions. Khrushchev stressed that the Soviet Union is willing to seriously address the issue of disarmament and consider relevant proposals from other countries. He added that, however, if the Political Committee is not discussing the issue of disarmament but the issue of "supervision of armaments," then the Soviet Union does not intend to participate in the work of this committee, nor does it intend to participate in any other committee that can only be used as a tool for deceiving public opinion.

    British Representative Ormsby-Gore attempted to prevent Khrushchev from speaking, on the pretext that the content of the speech was in "complete violation of the rules of procedure." Khrushchev said that the British representative in the United Nations does not understand the necessity of peace and disarmament and should be replaced. He also said that if war breaks out, that famous unsinkable British aircraft carrier (referring to the British Isles) will no longer exist on the first day of the war.

    Next, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal to discuss the issue of "the threat to universal peace caused by US aggression against the Soviet Union" by a vote of ten to fifty-four, with thirty-three abstentions. The countries in favor of the Soviet proposal were Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, and Cuba. Khrushchev walked out of the meeting room after the vote.

    The General Assembly passed the US-sponsored proposal, submitted by the General Committee, to hand the issue over to the Political Committee for discussion, without a vote.

    Next, the General Assembly continued its general political debate.

    苏联代表在联大斥责美国侵略挑衅政策
    美国操纵表决机器否决苏联要求大会讨论美机侵苏的建议
    赫鲁晓夫宣读提交政治委员会讨论的关于裁军问题的建议
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议13日上午结束了苏联提出的关于殖民地国家和人民独立的问题的议程的讨论后，接着就讨论苏联提出的“由于美国对苏联的侵略行动而造成对普遍和平的威胁”这一议题的安排。美国坚持要把这个问题交给政治委员会去辩论。联合国大会不顾社会主义国家代表的反对，又一次屈从美国的意旨，否决了苏联要求在大会全体会议上讨论这一重要议题的建议，而把这个议题交给政治委员会去讨论。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫首先发言。他说，大家知道，美国当局不止一次地派遣自己的间谍飞机侵入苏联的领空。美国总统艾森豪威尔不仅不就这种粗暴的侵略行动向我国道歉，反而甚至宣布这种飞行是美国的国策。他指出，美国的这种行动对整个国际局势产生了致命的影响，孕育着产生无穷灾难的威胁。苏联政府认为，必须直接在联大全体会议上讨论美国对苏联的侵略行动问题。
    他说，苏联把这个问题提交联大讨论，因为美国把违背国际法的做法列为自己的权利。美国飞机的侵略飞行不仅破坏了我国的主权，而且破坏了一系列其他国家的主权。如果对侵略者的这种行动不完全彻底地予以制止，如果对它们不加以谴责，那就会造成一种印象：联大赞成美国方面的这种行动，从而也就是鼓励它继续采取这种侵略行动。
    赫鲁晓夫说，把军队派到别的国家境内，或者怀着侵略目的把飞机派去，这是一个国家对另一个国家的军事入侵。对美国飞机侵略性地侵入苏联国境的事实就必须这样估价。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，苏联政府方面想尽一切努力以免在苏美关系中造成进一步的紧张局势。如果美国政府在联合国大会上声明：它对侵略苏联和其他国家的行动表示遗憾，并且保证美国政府今后将严守国际法原则，尊重苏联和所有其他国家的主权，那末我们就会认为这种保证就是美国承认自己在这个问题上做得不对，我们就不再坚持讨论这个问题。如果美国政府不谴责派自己的间谍飞机到苏联和其他国家去的做法，联合国应当极其严厉地谴责这种侵略行动，因为这是一个大国对其他国家采取的完全没有先例的行动，这种行动对普遍和平和各国人民的安全孕育着最严重的后果。他说，必须谴责和制止美国的这种政策，不让这类挑衅事件把世界引到战争的边缘。
    他最后说，苏联政府希望联合国不致辜负各国人民的希望，并成为加强和平的郑重的工具，成为各国主权的忠诚捍卫者。
    美国代表华兹沃斯甚至不顾美国总统艾森豪威尔亲口承认的派遣间谍飞机入侵苏联乃是美国的既定国策、而且美国还继续这样作等事实，而无耻抵赖说苏联对美国侵略行动的指责是“没有根据”和“违背事实的”，他还狡辩说，艾森豪威尔没有发出过要继续进行间谍飞行的威胁，而只是说“美国不会规避自己的防范突袭的责任”。华兹沃斯还搬出安全理事会在美国操纵下就美机侵苏事件作出的荒谬决定来为他的这些无耻谎言辩解。
    华兹沃斯在会上甚至公开耍无赖，企图反口咬人，诬蔑苏联提出这个谴责美国侵略的提案是为了“推卸”苏联“在公海上空击落美国RB—47飞机”的“责任”。
    华兹沃斯力图贬低这个议题的重要性。他胡说什么苏联的这个提案不是一个“一般性的控诉”而“只是一个根据两起具体事件提出的控诉”，他以此为“理由”反对在大会全体会议上讨论这个议题。
    接着，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维发言。他坚决驳斥美国代表团企图阻挠在大会上讨论美国对苏联的侵略行动问题的谰言。他说，如果认为，这个问题只涉及到苏、美两国的关系，那是错误的。在目前情况下，美国军用飞机的侵略行动对全世界说来是严重的危险。他要求谴责美国政府这种冒险的政策，因为这种政策侵害了全世界爱好和平的人民的切身利益。全体会议在戴维发言后休会。
    波兰外交部长腊帕茨基在下午全体会议上首先发言，他着重指出，由于美国对苏联的侵略行动而造成的对普遍和平的威胁这个议题应当作为极其重要和迫切的问题在大会全体会议上讨论。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫运用答辩权再次发言，驳斥美国代表关于美国对苏联侵略行动的无耻抵赖。赫鲁晓夫谈到美国代表再三强调安全理事会两次拒绝承认苏联对美国侵略行动控诉的合法性，并以此作为拒绝在联合国大会上讨论这个问题的理由时指出，正因为安全理事会上的这种情况，苏联现在才向联合国大会提出这个问题。赫鲁晓夫说，安全理事会比痰盂还要糟糕。他还说，美国和联合国是同一个东西，联合国是美国国务院的一个分支。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责华兹沃斯在RB—47飞机事件上撒谎。华兹沃斯硬说这架侵入苏联领空被击落的间谍飞机只在“公海”上飞行，并叫嚷什么要让国际法庭来仲裁。赫鲁晓夫驳斥说，苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅就是法官。如果有人闯进来，肇事人一定被粉碎。这就是苏联法庭的判决，不可能有另一个法庭。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到美国代表所说U—2飞机事件只不过是一个被苏联用来破坏最高级会议的借口时说，“看呀，锅子倒说水壶是黑的”。他说，美国总统、国务院和五角大楼全都为最高级会议的垮台进行了准备。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，如果美国在谈判的同时进行战争挑衅，那么裁军谈判有什么价值呢。他说，如果大会承认美国有从事这种挑衅飞行的权利的话，那么就得承认我们的权利。苏联将打落一切从事这种飞行的飞机，并且打击这些飞机起飞的外国基地。苏联不会在他人的压迫下屈膝。他又对帝国主义国家的代表说，如果你们要战争，那尽管挑拨好了。只要你们打定主意，你们就会得到战争。苏联将把侵略者打得一败涂地。他又说，是你们迫使我们不得不还击的。每一个国家都有权以牙还牙。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到在联合国大会开会前，苏联查明美国曾计划又派一架飞机在七万五千米高空侵入苏联，只是由于苏联的觉察才使美国放弃了这个计划。他还谴责北大西洋侵略集团计划在苏联边境演习。赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联国内的防务已处在戒备状态，准备随时粉碎敌人的侵略。赫鲁晓夫还谈到当他乘“波罗的海”号邮船到纽约来的时候，美国飞机和潜水艇曾进行挑衅。他说，你们想恐吓我们吗？你们想击沉我们的船吗？好啊，如果我沉到海底，我会把你们也拉入海底。
    赫鲁晓夫最后再次强调，必须迅速解决裁军问题。他宣读了苏联提交政治委员会讨论的“关于裁军问题和由于执行1959年11月20日联合国大会就这个问题通过的决议而形成的局势的建议”。这个建议重申苏联关于全面彻底裁军的主张，呼吁各国政府尽一切努力争取解决全面彻底裁军问题，尽快草拟和缔结裁军条约。建议还重申苏联改组联合国秘书处和安全理事会的结构的主张，从而使所有三种国家集团（社会主义国家、加入西方国家集团的国家和中立国家）在这些机构里都有均等的代表权。赫鲁晓夫着重指出，苏联愿意认真解决裁军问题，并考虑其他国家的有关建议。他又说，但是，如果政治委员会将讨论的不是裁军问题，而是“对军备的监督”问题，那么，苏联就不打算参加这个委员会的工作，也不打算参加别的什么委员会，因为它只能被用来作为欺骗舆论的工具。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔借口发言内容“完全违反议事规则”，企图阻止赫鲁晓夫发言。赫鲁晓夫说，在联合国中的英国代表不理解和平和裁军的必要，应当被撤换。他还说，假如战争爆发，那艘有名的英国不沉的航空母舰（指英伦三岛）在战争的第一天就不再存在。
    接着，大会以十票对五十四票、三十三票弃权否决了苏联要求在大会全体会议上讨论“由于美国对苏联的侵略行动造成对普遍和平的威胁”问题的建议。赞成苏联建议的是阿尔巴尼亚、白俄罗斯、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、苏联和古巴。赫鲁晓夫在表决后走出了会场。
    大会没有经过表决就通过了美国假手总务委员会提出的建议，把这个问题交给政治委员会讨论。
    接着，大会继续进行一般性的政治辩论。
