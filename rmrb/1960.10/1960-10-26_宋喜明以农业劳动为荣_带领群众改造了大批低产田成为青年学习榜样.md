Song Ximing takes pride in agricultural labor, leads the masses to transform large areas of low-yielding land, becoming a model for youth to learn from.

(Our dispatch) High school graduate Song Ximing resolutely listens to the Party's words, regarding engaging in agricultural labor as glorious labor and building the countryside as a glorious cause. For three years, he has led a group of young people in a tenacious struggle against nature, transforming large areas of low-yielding land into high-yielding land, and has been successively named a provincial, prefectural, county and national youth socialist construction activist. He is now the head of the Youth Experimental Farm of the Liuli People's Commune in Jinxi County, Jiangxi Province. In 1959, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party and became a communist fighter. The Jinxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all cadres, youth, and members of the county to learn from Song Ximing.

Song Ximing is the son of a poor peasant. After graduating from Linchuan High School in Jiangxi in 1957, he responded to the Party's call and returned to the countryside. His first labor assignment was to dig the ground. According to his original idea, digging the ground was very simple. However, upon contact with reality, there were many things to learn. Difficulties arose one after another. Before he had mastered farm work, the group leader assigned him to irrigate the red clover fields alone. This stumped him. In school, when studying botany, the lectures stated that red clover is a dry-land crop, and wouldn't irrigating dry-land crops drown them? Therefore, he squatted on the edge of the field, hesitant. Coincidentally, a commune member came by and asked him why he hadn't started watering. After he expressed his thoughts, the commune member laughed and said to him, "What the books say makes sense, but it hasn't rained for a long time, and the red clover is turning yellow from drought. If you don't hurry up and irrigate to moisten the soil, the red clover fields will run out of water, the roots won't take hold, and how can they flourish next year? Farming requires observing the sky, observing the land, and observing the seedlings." The facts proved to be as the farmer said. The irrigated red clover grew green, and a good harvest was obtained the following year.

In this way, Song Ximing slowly understood in his labor that the road to agricultural production is wide and vast. To make contributions to agricultural production, one must learn from the peasants in a down-to-earth manner and learn from practice.

At the end of 1958, he attended the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists. Young people from all over the country put forward the grand slogan of achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. After returning from Beijing, he reported to the commune Party committee and proposed to organize a youth shock brigade with his participation to transform the commune's low-yielding fields. The commune Party committee attached great importance to his opinion and immediately transferred seventeen young people from various production teams to establish a commune youth experimental farm. It also equipped them with two experienced old farmers as technical instructors, with him as the farm head, to transform the low-yielding fields in the Shangzhuang Brigade in the mountain hollow.

At the end of December, he arrived at his new battle post with seventeen young people. At this time, the winter plowing task of each team was nearing completion, but the more than one hundred mu of fields they were to cultivate still had thick brambles and weeds, as tall as a person, on both sides of the field ridges. The fields were far from the village, so to save time, they lived in a dilapidated temple with drafts on all sides. When it rained heavily at night, they had to sit and sleep while holding umbrellas. The commune had just been established and could not provide more livestock and farm tools for the time being. It only gave them two oxen, a plow, a harrow, and a hoe. Starting a business mainly depended on themselves. Song Ximing and his seventeen partners, relying on eighteen hands, began to draw the most beautiful pictures on this land, which was like a blank sheet of paper. Lacking production tools, Song Ximing took out all his twenty-four yuan to make plows and harrows. He also repaired the house himself and planted vegetables. The battle to transform low-yielding fields was fully launched, and the youth's enthusiasm suppressed the severe cold. The north wind howled in the mountain gully, but the young men were sweating profusely. After completing the winter plowing, they vigorously engaged in accumulating and making fertilizer. They proposed to get grain from fertilizer and fertilizer from the mountains. In more than three months, they retrieved more than 330,000 jin of self-made "fire-burned round fertilizer" (fire-soil fertilizer made from weeds and topsoil) from the mountains, and accumulated 90,000 dan of topsoil mud and garbage fertilizer.

After a year of hard work, early rice and late rice both reaped bumper harvests. The more than 100 mu of land managed by the youth experimental farm has changed its low-yield appearance.

Song Ximing always remembers the Party's teachings, strives to learn from the masses, and actively brings the culture and scientific knowledge he has learned to the countryside to serve agricultural production. He himself served as a teacher in the team's people's school, helping peasants learn to read, and also took the initiative to tutor several people's school teachers in nearby villages to prepare lessons and study. He taught classes at night and carried a small blackboard to the fields during the day, seizing breaks to teach peasants to read. Later, the commune established an agricultural middle school, and the Party organization also asked him to serve as a teacher in the agricultural middle school. The school was five li away from the place of production. He worked during the day and went to class at night. Sometimes, when he finished work late, he would bring his meal to the school and eat after finishing the class. He never stopped, even when it was windy or rainy. With the help of the commune Party committee secretary, he also conducted agricultural scientific experiments with the masses. He helped the team establish a scientific and technological research group to study and trial-produce local fertilizers and vigorously carry out technological innovation. Together with the farmers, he successively trial-produced and imitated seven kinds of local fertilizers, such as synthetic urea, nitrogen fertilizer, and calcium fertilizer, and created a bamboo-tooth weeding harrow, which increased work efficiency by about thirty times compared with manual weeding.

    宋喜明以农业劳动为荣
    带领群众改造了大批低产田成为青年学习榜样
    本报讯　高中毕业生宋喜明坚决听党的话，把从事农业劳动当成光荣的劳动，把建设农村视为光荣的事业。三年来，他带领一伙青年，向大自然作顽强的斗争，把大批低产田变成高产田，先后被评为县、专区、省和全国的青年社会主义建设积极分子。他现在是江西省金溪县琉璃人民公社青年试验场场长，1959年光荣地参加了中国共产党，成为一名共产主义的战士。中共金溪县委号召全县干部、青年和社员，向宋喜明学习。
    宋喜明是一个贫农的儿子。1957年从江西临川高中毕业后，即响应党的号召，回到了农村。第一次劳动，是分配他去刨地。按他原来的想法，刨地是再简单不过的了。但是，一接触实际，其中却有许多学问。困难一个接着一个，农活还没学好，小组长又分配他一个人去向红花草田里灌水。这可把他难住了。在学校里学习植物学，上面讲的红花草是旱作物，旱作物灌水不是会淹死吗？因此，他蹲在田头上踌躇不决。恰巧一个社员走来，问他为什么还不去放水？他说出他的想法之后，那位社员笑了，向他说：“书本上说的也是道理，可是天好久没有落雨，红花旱黄了，不赶快灌水润地，红花田断了水，根子扎不下去，来年还能发旺吗？种田得看天、看地、看庄稼苗儿。”事实果如那位农民所说的一样，灌了水的红花草，青绿绿的长起来了，第二年获得了好收成。
    就这样，宋喜明在劳动中慢慢地懂得农业生产之路又宽又广。要想对农业生产有所贡献，就必须踏踏实实地向农民学习，向实际学习。
    1958年底，他出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。全国各地青年在会上纷纷提出了提前实现农业发展纲要的雄伟的口号。从北京回来以后，他向公社党委作了汇报，并提出组织一个有他参加的青年突击队，去改造社里的低产田。公社党委十分重视他的意见，立即从各生产队抽调了十七名青年，成立了一个公社青年试验场；并配备了两个有丰富生产经验的老农作技术指导，由他作场长，去山窝里的尚庄大队改造低产田。
    12月底，他带着十七名青年来到了新的战斗岗位。这时各队的冬翻地任务快结束了，而他们要耕种的那一百多亩田，田塍两边还是一人来深的荆棘荒草。田离村子远，为了抢时间，他们就住在田间一座四面透风的破庙里。碰到晚上下大雨，还得撑着伞坐着睡。公社刚刚建立，一时还不能拿出更多的畜力和农具，只给了他们两头耕牛、一张犁、一张耙、和一柄锄头。创家立业主要靠自己。宋喜明和他的十七个伙伴，就凭着十八双手，在这块像白纸一样的土地上，开始绘最美丽的图画。没有生产工具，宋喜明把自己仅有的二十四元钱全部拿出来打犁耙，自己还动手修理了房子，开荒种上了蔬菜。大战低产田的战斗全面开展起来，青年人的热劲压住了严寒。山沟里北风呼啸，小伙子们却干得满脸流汗。完成了冬翻地，接着又大搞积肥造肥。他们提出向肥要粮，向山要肥。三个多月，从山上取回了自制的“火烧圆肥”（杂草和地皮土烧制的火土肥）三十三万多斤，积了地皮泥、垃圾肥九万多担。
    大战了一年，早稻、晚稻连续丰收。青年试验场经营的一百多亩田地，已改变了低产面貌。
    宋喜明时刻记住党的教导，努力向群众学习，也积极把自己学到的文化和科学知识带到农村，为农业生产服务。他自己担任了队里的民校教师，帮助农民学文化，还主动辅导附近村子里几个民校教师备课和学习。晚上上课，白天下田还背着小黑板，抓住休息的空儿教农民认字。后来，社里办起了农业中学，党组织又让他兼任农中教师。学校离生产的地方有五里来路，白天劳动，晚上去上课，有时收工晚了，他就带上饭赶到学校，等上完课才吃饭，刮风下雨也不间断。在公社党委书记的帮助下，他还和群众一起进行农业科学试验。帮助队里成立了一个科学技术研究小组，研究试制土化肥，大搞技术革新。他和农民一起，先后试制和仿制了人造尿、氮肥、钙肥等七种土化肥，创造了一种竹齿耘禾耙，比手耘提高了工效三十倍左右。（附图片）
