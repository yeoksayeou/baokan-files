Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session continued yesterday afternoon to discuss procedural issues related to the agenda items. The meeting first discussed the Soviet Union's proposal to include the question of granting independence to colonial countries and peoples on the agenda for discussion at the General Assembly plenary session.

At the meeting, representatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, supported by representatives of many newly independent countries, exposed the despicable conspiracies of colonialist countries to obstruct discussion of this issue in the General Assembly plenary session and engaged in sharp struggles with them.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, spoke first. He pointed out that some people were trying to oppose the discussion of the elimination of the colonial system at the UN General Assembly plenary session with the participation of heads of government, and that it was futile for colonialists to try to stop the great movement of oppressed peoples to fight for freedom and independence. He said that the complete elimination of the colonial system was only a matter of time. If the United Nations wants to be true to its Charter, it should not stand on the side of evading the solution to this problem.

Khrushchev then exposed the various crimes of the colonialists, mocking the so-called slogans of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" chanted by the colonialists, which he considered the delirium of slave traders and slave owners. He said that it was necessary to resolutely expose the true face of the colonialists and to expose the faces of those who brought disease, poverty, hunger, and death to the enslaved countries.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers emphasized that everyone should recognize the extraordinary importance of this international issue of freeing humanity from the shameful colonial order left over from the past. Khrushchev said that the UN General Assembly should be fully aware of its responsibility that, if the most urgent measures are not taken, colonialism may still cause more suffering and disaster, ruin the lives of millions of people, and cause armed conflicts and wars, threatening not only individual regions of the world but also world peace and security.

Khrushchev said that this is why we say that the issue of completely eliminating the colonial system is, to a large extent, an issue of maintaining and strengthening peace and international security.

Khrushchev said that if the United Nations does not accept the proposal to abolish the colonial system, then the people of the colonial countries will have no other choice but to take up arms. If they are not given the right to live independently, to choose a political and social system according to their own will, and to build the life they desire on their own land, then they will obtain this right through struggle.

British representative Gore spoke after Khrushchev and attacked Khrushchev's speech, vigorously defending British colonial rule. He described Khrushchev's exposure of the various evils of colonialism as so-called "mythical descriptions" and an "insult" to his "audience." He also falsely accused the Soviet Union of proposing a declaration on the elimination of colonialism "for propaganda purposes" and that the Soviet Union was "not interested in studying the true nature of the issue." The British representative also tried to promote the "virtues" of British colonialism, saying that "successive British governments have sought to promote the independence of the people of dependent countries as quickly as possible." He said that what the British colonialists "have done in this regard can stand up to scrutiny."

Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David pointed out that hundreds of millions of people still live under colonial slavery. Colonialism is not only the source of poverty and oppression, but also a dangerous hotbed for wars. The events in the Congo are proof of this.

David emphasized that it is necessary to discuss the declaration on granting independence to all colonial peoples in the General Assembly plenary session. He said that his delegation would vote in favor of the Soviet proposal on this issue.

Ghanaian representative Quaison-Sackey refuted the shameless platitudes of the representatives of Western countries, as if their rule in the colonies was aimed at training the people of these countries for independent life. He said that it must be stipulated that independence be granted to colonial peoples in the shortest possible time, and we do not believe there is a problem of immature people who have not been trained for self-government.

Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Tarabanov said that the colonialists were trying to transfer this issue to the First Committee for discussion and were trying to evade the adoption of concrete resolutions, thereby maintaining the shameful colonial system.

Iraqi representative Pachachi warmly supported the Soviet proposal. He emphasized that the Soviet declaration on the immediate elimination of the colonial system had nothing to do with the First Committee and should be discussed in the General Assembly plenary session.

Guinean representative Ismail Touré pointed out that Western countries opposed discussing the declaration on granting independence to colonial peoples, on the pretext that it would become propaganda. He said that African countries are not afraid of propaganda, especially when it refers to the freedom of their people. Touré said that whether you want it or not, granting freedom to colonial peoples is an extremely important issue because it is linked to the issue of world peace.

In his speech, Touré emphasized that the attitude of various countries in the world towards the colonial issue is the criterion by which African people evaluate different groups in this world.

Touré then pointed out that while some countries continue to plunder colonial peoples, their representatives are here talking about the evils of colonialism. This is purely hypocrisy.

Libyan representative Fagini said that the Soviet proposal is a solemn declaration on the complete elimination of colonialism. Given the seriousness of this issue, it must be discussed in the highest forum—the UN General Assembly plenary session.

Representative Tchetcheli of the Republic of the Congo (capital in Brazzaville) spoke. He cited a telegram reminding the Assembly of the plight of the residents of Cabinda, a Portuguese colony. He said that 60,000 people are groaning under Portuguese rule, and they are calling for help in their struggle for liberation and for a better life.

The President of the Assembly, Irish representative Boland, rudely interrupted his speech, on the pretext that the Congolese representative's speech was irrelevant to the procedural issue. Tchetcheli retorted to the President that he, like other representatives, had the right to clarify his position. He questioned why the President allowed the British representative to "speak at will" while stopping him from speaking. "Only apply the rules to my own speech." He said, I am here not only to clarify my own position, but also to enable the representatives to hear the voices of their brothers who are suffering under colonial oppression. The President interrupted the Congolese representative's speech again before it was finished. But then friendly applause rang out in the hall to welcome the Congolese representative's speech.

Nigerian representative Wachuku expressed support for the Soviet proposal, pointing out that many countries seem to completely ignore everything that is happening around them. He said that they live like ostriches with their heads buried in the sand.

Philippine representative Sumulong, who spoke next, played the shameful role of a colonialist pawn. He opposed discussing the Soviet declaration on ending colonialism in the General Assembly plenary session, and made malicious attacks and slanders against Eastern European socialist countries, describing them as Soviet "colonies" and saying that the Soviet declaration should also apply to them.

Romanian representative Brucan spoke, severely refuting this rude attack. He condemned the President of the Assembly, Irish representative Boland, for his lack of objectivity in not allowing representatives of newly admitted countries to speak, and condemned him for condoning the vicious slander by American lackeys against the dignity of UN member states.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Khrushchev, then requested to raise a question on the rules of procedure. Assembly President Boland tried to prevent him from speaking and allowed the Philippine representative to continue his slander and attacks. At Khrushchev's firm request, Boland had to allow him to speak. Khrushchev strode to the podium and severely condemned the Assembly President for this pro-colonialist behavior.

Khrushchev said, I protest the unequal treatment of the representatives of the countries present. Why did the Assembly President stop Mr. Congo's representative when he spoke on behalf of his country? Why? Because he quoted a telegram he received from his brothers who are still groaning under colonial oppression. But the President stopped him and declared that this was a substantive issue, saying that only procedural issues were being discussed here. But why didn't the President stop this lackey of American imperialism, the Philippine representative, when he talked about something that was not a procedural issue at all? Is this fair? No, it's not fair.

Khrushchev said, you cannot suppress the voice of the people, the voice of truth. He said that it is time to bury colonialism, and the sooner and deeper we bury it, the better.

Representatives from Morocco, Ethiopia, Cuba, Cyprus, Afghanistan, Israel, and Venezuela also spoke at the meeting, all emphasizing the importance of discussing the declaration on granting independence to the peoples of colonial countries in the General Assembly plenary session. They said that they would vote in favor of the Soviet proposal.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Khrushchev, then spoke again, answering the attacks and slanders against the Soviet Union by the British representative and representatives of other colonial countries. Khrushchev said that Britain has been extracting the blood and sweat of the people of India and other colonies in Africa and Asia, and now he still does not want to give up on this.

Khrushchev reiterated the need to discuss the declaration on the elimination of the colonial system in the plenary session. He said: After the collapse of the colonial system, we can live happily. We will have the honor to pick up shovels, bury colonialism deep, and drive aspen stakes into its grave.

U.S. Representative Wilcox used the right of reply to speak, insisting that the Soviet proposal be discussed in the Political Committee. He also shamelessly attacked the Eastern European socialist countries as "not completely free."

The shameless lies of the U.S. representative aroused the anger of representatives from many countries. Romanian representative Misineanu angrily stood up and requested to speak on the podium on the procedure of the meeting. The chairman of the congress was forced to order Wilcox to step aside. Misineanu went to the podium and condemned the U.S. representative's nonsense. He reminded him that this was not the U.S. Senate. The Romanian representative also rebuked the position of the chairman of the congress, Irish representative Boland, for safeguarding colonial interests. He asked the chairman to stop insults at the congress and to make the debate conform to basic etiquette.

At this time, the president of the conference, Boland, became angry with shame. He tried to stop the Romanian representative from speaking by hitting his gavel forcefully. He was so rude that he even broke his gavel, but he continued to hit it desperately with the handle. Finally, he rudely cut off the amplification system, interrupted the Romanian representative's speech, and suddenly adjourned the meeting without voting on the Soviet proposal.

This rude action of the chairman of the congress caused dissatisfaction among most of the representatives, who stayed in the hall for a long time and refused to leave.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch, New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session continued yesterday morning to debate whether to submit the Soviet proposal on the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries to the General Assembly plenary session for discussion or to the Political Committee for discussion. The meeting decided to submit this issue to the General Assembly for discussion without a vote.

At yesterday's meeting, representatives from the United States, Britain, and other countries, considering their isolated position on this issue, had to put on a different tone. U.S. Representative Wilcox hypocritically stated in his speech that although the United States believed that the discussion of this issue should be conducted in the Political Committee as usual, in consideration of the interests of "human freedom" around the world, "it is very willing to see the Soviet proposal discussed in the UN General Assembly plenary session." British representative Ormsby-Gore announced that he also "agreed" to debate the issue of colonial independence in the General Assembly.

Then the Assembly, without anyone objecting, passed a resolution to submit the Soviet proposal on the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples to the 15th UN General Assembly for discussion. This decision by the Assembly completely bankrupted a resolution forced through by the General Committee, which opposed submitting the Soviet proposal to the General Assembly plenary session for discussion and attempted to send it to the Political Committee to bury it.

At the beginning of yesterday morning's meeting, Guinean President Sékou Touré spoke at the meeting. Since Touré was about to leave New York, the President of the Assembly allowed him to make an exceptional speech.

Touré emphasized that the most important international issue is the liberation of the peoples who are still under colonial slavery. He pointed out that at yesterday's meeting, the vast majority of representatives warmly expressed their support for the "draft declaration proposed by the Soviet Union on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples." Touré called on the Assembly to unanimously adopt this declaration. Touré pointed out that, of course, there is a big gap between passing a resolution and implementing it.

After the Assembly passed the Soviet proposal, the head of the Soviet delegation, Khrushchev, used the right of reply to speak. He expressed his extreme satisfaction that the U.S. representative agreed to discuss this extremely important issue—the issue of the liberation of colonial peoples—in the UN General Assembly plenary session.

Khrushchev pointed out that the issue is not the procedure, but the substance of supporting the declaration on the elimination of the colonial system. He said, we must ensure a situation where the people who are still suffering under colonial oppression obtain freedom and independence.

Khrushchev said that no one is incorrigible. Even some colonialists like Spain and Britain—and these are the oldest colonialists—are not incorrigible. If they are given a good brainwashing, then they will begin to correctly understand the issues being discussed at this session of the UN General Assembly, and they even made statements saying that they will vote "in favor."

Khrushchev said again that we are very pleased that our proposal has received the support of the United States, and even Britain—the old colonial country—voted the same way as us. I shake hands with them. If we act like this in the future, it will only benefit the people of all countries.

If the conference can be as united on the issue of disarmament as it is on this issue, then you can imagine what a step we will be able to take along the path of reaching an agreement on comprehensive and thorough disarmament under strict international supervision! He said that the people of all countries should take their destiny into their own hands and not hope that this issue, the issue of the future of mankind, the issue of peace and war, can only be solved by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. He said that the issue of disarmament and the issue of world peace should be treated with the same sense of responsibility as the issue of eliminating the colonial system.

    联大围绕殖民地独立问题展开激烈辩论
    社会主义和亚非国家代表揭露殖民主义罪行  美英等国代表恶毒诬蔑苏联
    以美国为首的殖民主义国家害怕处境孤立被迫同意在大会上讨论苏联建议
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议昨天下午继续讨论有关大会议程项目的程序问题。会议首先讨论的是苏联所提出的主张在大会全体会议上讨论关于给殖民地国家和人民独立的问题的建议。
    在会议上，苏联和其他社会主义国家代表在许多新独立的国家代表的支持下，揭露了殖民主义国家代表企图阻挠在大会全体会议讨论这一问题的卑鄙阴谋，并且同他们进行了尖锐的斗争。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫首先发言，他谈到有人企图反对在有政府首脑参加的联合国大会全体会议上讨论消灭殖民主义制度的问题时指出，殖民主义者妄图阻止被压迫人民争取自由和独立的伟大运动，这是徒劳无益的。他说，殖民主义制度的彻底消灭只是一个时间问题。联合国如果想忠于自己的宪章，那它就不应站在规避解决这个问题的一边。
    赫鲁晓夫接着揭露了殖民主义者的种种罪行，嘲笑殖民主义者喊的所谓“自由、平等和博爱”的口号，他认为这是奴隶贩子和奴隶主们的谵语。他说，必须坚决揭露殖民主义者的原形，必须揭穿那些给被奴役的国家带来疾病、贫困、饥饿和死亡的人的嘴脸。
    苏联部长会议主席着重指出，每个人都应当认清使人类摆脱过去遗留下来的可耻的殖民主义秩序的这一国际问题的异常重要的意义。赫鲁晓夫说，联合国大会应该以充分责任感意识到，如果不采取最紧急的措施，殖民主义仍然可能引起更多的痛苦和灾难，葬送千百万人的生命，引起武装冲突和战争，不仅使世界个别地区，而且会使全世界的和平和安全受到威胁。
    赫鲁晓夫说，正因为如此，我们说，完全消除殖民主义制度的问题，在很大的程度上就是维护和加强和平和国际安全的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果联合国不接受取消殖民主义制度的建议，那末殖民地国家的人民除了拿起武器以外别无其他出路。如果不给他们权利去独立生存、按照自己的意愿选择政治和社会制度、在自己的土地上建立自己所希望的生活，那末他们就要在斗争中取得这种权利。
    英国代表戈尔在赫鲁晓夫发言后发言，他攻击赫鲁晓夫的发言，并且极力为英国的殖民统治辩护。他把赫鲁晓夫对殖民主义的种种罪恶的揭露说成是所谓“神话式的描述”，是对他这种“听众”的“侮辱”。他并且诬蔑苏联提出关于消灭殖民主义的宣言是“为了进行宣传目的”，苏联“对研究这个问题的真正性质不感兴趣”。英国代表还竭力宣扬英国殖民主义的“德政”，他说什么英国“历届政府都设法以尽可能快的速度促进附属国人民取得独立。”他说，英国殖民主义者“在这方面所作所为是经得起检查的”。
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部部长戴维指出，有成亿人口现在仍然生活在殖民主义的奴役下。殖民主义不仅是贫困和受压迫的根源，而且是造成战争的一个危险温床。刚果所发生的事件就是这种情况的证明。
    戴维强调，有必要在联大全体会议上讨论给予一切殖民地人民独立的宣言。他说，他的代表团将投票赞成苏联就这个问题的提案。
    加纳代表奎森·萨基在发言中驳斥了西方国家代表这种无耻的滥调，好像他们在殖民地的统治的目的是训练这些国家的人民走上独立的生活。他说，必须规定在最短时间内给予殖民地人民独立，我们认为不存在未经自治训练的未成熟的人民的问题。
    保加利亚外交部副部长塔拉巴诺夫说，殖民主义者企图把这个问题转交给第一委员会讨论，并竭力规避通过具体的决议，从而来保持可耻的殖民主义制度。
    伊拉克代表帕查奇热情地支持苏联的建议。他着重指出，苏联提出的立即消灭殖民主义制度的宣言对第一委员会没有任何关系，而应当在大会全体会议上讨论。
    几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔指出，西方国家代表反对讨论关于给予殖民地人民以独立的宣言，借口说这会变成宣传。他说，非洲国家不害怕宣传，特别是当这里指的是他们的人民的自由的时候。杜尔说，无论你们希望不希望这一点，给殖民地人民以自由是极重要的问题，因为它同全世界和平问题联系在一起。
    杜尔在发言中强调指出，世界各国对殖民地问题的态度是非洲人民评价这个世界上不同集团的准绳。
    杜尔接着指出，当某些国家继续在掠夺殖民地人民的时候，它们的代表却在这里高谈殖民主义的毒害。这纯粹是一种伪善态度。
    利比亚代表法基尼说，苏联的建议是关于彻底消灭殖民主义的一个庄严的宣言。鉴于这个问题的严重性，必须在最高的场所——联合国大会全体会议上讨论它。
    刚果共和国（首都在布拉柴维尔）代表切切利发言。他援引了一封电报，提醒大会注意葡萄牙殖民地喀奔达居民的困苦情况。他说，六万人在葡萄牙的统治下呻吟，他们呼吁援助他们争取解放、争取美好生活的斗争。
    大会主席爱尔兰代表博兰粗暴地打断了他的发言，借口说什么刚果代表的发言与程序问题无关。切切利反驳主席说，他同其他代表一样有权阐明自己的立场。他质问主席为什么让英国代表“随心所欲地发言”而却制止他发言。“只向我自己的发言引用规则”。他说，我到这里来，不仅是为了阐明自己的主张，而且也是为了使各代表能够听取在殖民主义压迫下而遭到痛苦的自己兄弟的呼声。主席还没有等到刚果代表的发言结束就再次打断了他的发言。但这时大厅里发出了友好的掌声欢迎刚果代表发言。
    尼日利亚代表瓦舒库表示支持苏联建议，他指出，许多国家似乎完全不理会它们周围发生的一切。他说，它们像把头钻在沙子里的驼鸟一样生活着。
    接着发言的菲律宾代表苏木朗充当了殖民主义马前卒的可耻角色，他反对在大会全体会议上讨论苏联提出的结束殖民主义宣言，并且对东欧社会主义国家进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑，把它们说成是苏联的“殖民地”，说什么苏联提出的宣言也应该适用于它们。
    罗马尼亚代表布鲁坎发言，严厉驳斥这种无礼的攻击。他谴责大会主席、爱尔兰代表博兰不让新加入的国家的代表发言的不客观态度，并谴责他纵容美国走狗对联合国会员国尊严进行的恶毒诽谤。
    苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫接着要求就议事规则提出质询，大会主席博兰企图阻止他发言并且让菲律宾代表继续他的诽谤和攻击。在赫鲁晓夫的坚决要求下，博兰不得不允许他讲话。赫鲁晓夫大步踏上讲坛，严厉谴责大会主席这种维护殖民主义的作法。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我抗议对在座的各国代表采取的不平等态度。当刚果代表先生代表自己的国家发言时，为什么大会主席阻止他？为什么？因为他引用了他从还在殖民主义压迫下呻吟的兄弟那儿收到的电报。但是主席阻止了他，并且宣布，这是一个实质问题，说什么这里讨论的只是程序性质的问题。可是，刚才这个美帝国主义的走狗——菲律宾代表在发言中谈的完全不是程序问题时，那为什么主席不阻止他呢？难道这公正吗？不，不公正。
    赫鲁晓夫说，你们压不住人民的声音，真理的声音。他说，现在是埋葬殖民主义的时候了，我们把它埋葬得越快，越深越好。
    在会上发言的还有摩洛哥、埃塞俄比亚、古巴、塞浦路斯、阿富汗、以色列和委内瑞拉代表，他们都着重指出了在联大全体会议上讨论关于给予殖民地国家人民以独立的宣言的重要性。他们说，他们将投票赞成苏联的提案。
    苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫接着再次发言，回答了英国代表以及其他殖民主义国家代表对苏联的攻击和诽谤。赫鲁晓夫说，英国一直在榨取印度以及非洲和亚洲其他殖民地人民的血汗，现在他仍然不想放弃这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫再次指出必须在全体会议上讨论消灭殖民主义制度的宣言。他说：殖民制度崩溃以后，我们可以愉快地生活，我们将荣幸地拿起锹，深深地埋葬殖民主义，并在坟上打上杨树桩。
    美国代表威尔科克斯利用答辩权发言，坚持要把苏联提出的这项议程放到政治委员会上讨论，他并且无耻攻击东欧社会主义国家“没有完全的自由”。
    美国代表的无耻谰言引起许多国家代表的愤怒，罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库愤怒地站起来要求就议事程序上台发言，大会主席不得不命令威尔科克斯让开。米辛契斯库登上讲台严厉斥责美国代表这派胡言，他提醒他说，这不是在美国参议院。罗马尼亚代表还斥责了大会主席爱尔兰代表博兰维护殖民主义利益的立场。他要求主席制止在大会上凌辱名誉，使辩论符合起码的礼节。
    大会主席博兰这时竟老羞成怒，他用力敲打他的小槌企图制止罗马尼亚代表的发言，他粗暴到这种程度，以至把他的小槌都敲断了，但是他仍然继续用槌柄拚命敲打。最后他竟粗暴地截断扩音系统打断罗马尼亚代表的发言，并且没有就苏联建议进行表决就突然宣布休会。
    大会主席这种粗暴举动引起大多数代表的不满，他们久久留在大厅里不肯散去。
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议昨天上午继续辩论把苏联提出的给予殖民地国家独立的宣言问题提交大会全体会议讨论，还是提交政治委员会讨论的问题。会议未经表决就决定把这个问题提交大会讨论。
    在昨天的会议上美英等国代表考虑到他们在这个问题上所处的孤立地位，不得不装出另外一副腔调。美国代表威尔科克斯在发言中虚伪地表示，虽然美国认为对这一问题的讨论应当像一般惯例那样在政治委员会上进行，但是考虑到世界范围内“人类自由”的利益，“它非常愿意看到苏联的建议在联合国大会全体会议上讨论。”英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔宣布他也“赞成”在全体大会上辩论殖民地独立问题。
    接着大会在没有人反对的情况下通过把苏联提出的关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言提交第十五届联合国大会全体会议讨论。大会这一决定使美英强迫总务委员会通过的一项决议遭到彻底破产，这项决议反对把苏联的这项建议提交大会全体会议讨论，而企图送到政治委员会去埋葬它。
    在昨天上午会议开始时，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔在会上讲了话。由于杜尔即将离开纽约，大会主席允许他作一次例外的发言。
    杜尔着重指出，国际问题中最重要的问题是解放现在还处于殖民主义奴役下的人民。他指出，在昨天会议上，极大多数的代表都热烈表示支持“苏联提出的给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言”的草案，杜尔呼吁大会一致通过这个宣言。杜尔指出，当然，通过决议和实现决议之间是有很大距离的。
    在大会通过苏联建议之后，苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫利用答辩权发言。他对美国代表同意把这个极其重要的问题——殖民地人民解放的问题——在联合国大会全体会议上讨论这一点感到极为满意。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，问题不在于程序、而是在实质上支持消灭殖民主义制度的宣言。他说，我们必须保证这样一种状况，使还在殖民主义压迫下而遭到痛苦的人民获得自由和独立。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不可救药的人是没有的。即使像西班牙和英国这样一些殖民主义者——而这是最老牌的殖民主义者——也不是不可救药的。如果给他们好好洗洗头脑的话，那末他们就会开始正确地理解在联合国大会本届会议上所讨论的问题，甚至他们也发表了声明，说他们将投票“赞成”。
    赫鲁晓夫再一次说，我们感到非常高兴，我们的建议得到了美国的支持，甚至英国——这个老牌殖民主义的国家也和我们一样的投票。我向他们握手。如果我们今后将这样行动，这只会造福于各国人民。
    如果在裁军问题上大会也像在这个问题上一样地一致，那末，你们可以设想，我们将能沿着达成在严格的国际监督下的全面彻底裁军协议的道路上迈出怎样的一步！他说，世界各国人民应当把自己的命运掌握在自己的手中，不要希望，这个问题、人类未来的问题、和平与战争的问题只有苏联、美国、英国和法国能够解决。他说，要像对待解决消除殖民制度问题时所怀的同样的责任感，来对待裁军问题，世界和平问题。
