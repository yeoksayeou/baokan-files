    The No. 1 pig iron furnace of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, "Politically in command at the furnace front," overcame technical hurdles and became a bright red banner for high production, high quality, and long life of pig iron furnaces nationwide. This furnace has a total of eighteen employees, who are as united as one person with the Party and Youth League organizations as the core. They help each other everywhere, pay attention to cooperating well with the logistics departments, and continuously improve production levels.
    The picture below shows the eighteen warriors on this furnace.
    The leader of the three shifts of this furnace often takes the lead in tackling key problems. They contracted several of the most difficult to unblock tuyeres, leading all employees to eliminate air leakage from the tuyeres, greatly increasing the air volume and further improving the hourly melting rate. The picture above shows Li Zongyou (back), the leader of the Class A shift, and Chen Zhifu (front), a furnace worker, at the tuyere.

    当代英雄
    上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉“政治上炉前”，攻破技术关，成为全国化铁炉高产、优质、长寿的一面鲜艳的红旗。这个炉子共有十八个职工，他们以党、团组织为核心，团结得像一个人一样。他们处处互相帮助，注意和后勤部门搞好协作，使生产水平不断提高。
    下图是这个炉子上的十八个勇士。
    这个炉子的三班炉长经常带头攻关键。他们分工包下了几个最难通的风眼，带动全体职工消灭风眼漏风现象，使风量大增，小时溶化率进一步提高。上图为甲班炉长李宗佑（后）和炉工陈志福（前）在通风眼。
