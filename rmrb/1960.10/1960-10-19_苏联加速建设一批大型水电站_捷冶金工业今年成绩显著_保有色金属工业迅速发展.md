    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow - The Soviet Union is accelerating the construction of twenty-five large-scale hydroelectric power stations, some of which will be fully or partially put into production this year and next.
    The Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the lower reaches of the Volga River, currently the world's largest hydropower station, has produced approximately 5 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity since its construction began in 1958. The builders here are now guaranteeing that all power generation capacity will be put into production before the end of this year. In this way, the hydropower station can be completed a year ahead of schedule, saving the country 3 billion rubles. The twentieth unit is being installed, and the base of the twenty-first is being lowered. As the installation work nears completion, the installation workers are moving to other fronts to support new projects.
    At the construction site of the Saratov Hydropower Station on the middle reaches of the Volga River, the cofferdam for the dam is currently being built, and preparations for the foundation of the plant building are underway. The characteristic of this hydropower station is that the entire plant building will be composed of reinforced concrete components, a method that has not been used in the construction of large hydropower stations in the Soviet Union or other countries.
    Another of the largest power projects, the Bratsk Hydropower Station on the Angara River in Siberia, is accelerating the construction of dams and plant buildings. Some of its generator sets will be put into production next year, and construction workers began installing the first unit on September 14. On the same day, the concrete workers here also set a world record: the communist labor team led by Mescherin poured 616 cubic meters of concrete in eight hours using a ten-ton high-boom crane. They broke the theoretical design standards and created this achievement with a spirit of bold creation. The workers of the entire project proposed not to slow down the construction speed even in the severe winter.
    The construction of the Kremenchug Hydropower Station on the Dnieper River, which started partial power generation last year, is also proceeding ahead of schedule. The tenth unit (power of 57,200 kilowatts) started generating electricity on September 18, ten days ahead of schedule. The builders are striving to put all twelve turbines into operation before the 43rd anniversary of the October Revolution. This project has also received strong support from brother enterprises. The Kharkov Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant has timely manufactured the twelfth—the last—unit for it.
    In addition, on the Bukhtarma River in Kazakhstan, the Vilyuy River in Yakutia, the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan, the Naryn River in Kyrgyzstan, and many other rivers, the construction of hydropower stations is in full swing.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague - The metallurgical industry of Czechoslovakia has achieved remarkable results since the beginning of this year.
    Compared with the same period last year, pig iron production increased by 11.2%, steel increased by 10.5%, and steel products increased by 14.5% in the first half of this year. Compared with the same period last year, pig iron increased by 9.8% and steel by 13.5% in July this year.
    Since the beginning of this year, many new projects in the metallurgical industry have been completed and put into production. These include two coke ovens, one blast furnace, four open-hearth furnaces, four electric furnaces, four rolling lines, and one longitudinal welding line. In addition, many metallurgical equipments have been renovated and expanded.
    Based on the widespread technical innovation movement among metallurgical workers, many new technologies have continued to be adopted this year. For example, in order to increase pig iron production, many new sintering machines have been built this year, increasing the utilization rate of lean ore. In terms of increasing steel production, the use of fuel oil instead of gas has greatly increased the heat and shortened the steelmaking time. In order to increase the output of steel products, in addition to mechanizing and specializing old rolling lines, a continuous straight-in rolling line has also been newly built.
    During the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Czechoslovakia's metallurgical industry will have further development, and steel production will increase by 54%. Many major capital construction projects have now begun, for example, the capital construction project of Czechoslovakia's second metallurgical base—the East Slovak Iron and Steel United Enterprise—is currently being accelerated.
    The enthusiastic labor of the workers has greatly promoted the development of the metallurgical industry. In the first half of this year, the number of employees in the metallurgical industry participating in the socialist labor competition accounted for 71.8% of the total number of workers. There were 1,547 collectives, that is, 10% of the total number of employees, participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and 79 of these collectives have won this glorious title.

    Xinhua News Agency - According to a report by the Bulgarian News Agency, the Rhodope Mountains in southern Bulgaria, which contains abundant lead-zinc mines and other valuable non-ferrous metal mines, has become the center of large-scale industrial construction in recent years. New mining projects and concentrators have been put into production one after another, and a large-scale lead-zinc plant has been built in Gergyalili.
    The amount of ore mined here has increased rapidly in recent years, from 96,000 tons in 1939 to 1.34 million tons in 1955, and the amount of ore mined this year will exceed 2.8 million tons.
    Recently, the construction of a second large-scale non-ferrous metal complex has begun at the foot of the Rhodope Mountains near Plovdiv. Most of the ore from Rhodope will be processed by this factory, which will provide the country with approximately 30,000 tons of zinc, 40,000 tons of lead, 60,000 tons of sulfuric acid, as well as a large amount of gold, silver, copper, bismuth, cobalt, and other rare metals. Now, the Rhodope region has formed a huge center of Bulgaria's non-ferrous metallurgical industry.
    Before liberation, this area was the poorest and most backward place in Bulgaria, and people lived a primitive pastoral life. After liberation, with the development of industrial production, the face of this area has undergone fundamental changes. New cities and towns are growing, and hundreds of kilometers of roads have connected the settlements in the Rhodope Mountains with other parts of the country. The original herders have become skilled technical workers in the mines. (Attached picture)

    苏联加速建设一批大型水电站
    捷冶金工业今年成绩显著　保有色金属工业迅速发展
    据新华社莫斯科讯　苏联正在加紧建设二十五个大型水力发电站，其中某些电站在今明两年内将全部或部分投入生产。
    目前全世界最大的水力发电站——伏尔加河下游的斯大林格勒水电站从1958年动工以来，已经生产了约五十亿度的廉价电力，这里的建设者们现在提出保证，要在今年年底以前就使全部发电能力投入生产。这样一来，这个水电站就可提前一年完工，从而为国家节约三十亿卢布。这个水电站的第二十台联动机正在安装中，第二十一台的底轮也已经下放。由于安装工作接近尾声，安装工人们纷纷开赴其他战线支援新工程。
    在伏尔加河中游的萨拉托夫水电站的工地上，现在正在修建水坝的围堰和进行厂房奠基的准备工作。这座水电站的特点是：整个厂房都将用钢筋混凝土构件组成，无论是苏联或是其他国家，在兴建大型水电站时都未曾用过这种方法。
    另一个最大的动力工程——西伯利亚安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站正在加速建筑水坝和厂房。它的部分发电机组将在明年投入生产，建筑工人们已经在9月14日开始安装第一个机组。在同一天，这里的混凝土工人们还创造了一个世界纪录：梅谢林领导的共产主义劳动队在八小时的时间内用十吨高架臂式起重机浇灌了六百一十六立米的混凝土。他们是以大胆创造的精神打破理论设计的标准创造出这个成绩的。整个工程的工人们提出，在严寒的冬季也不放慢施工速度。
    从去年开始部分发电的第聂伯河上的克列门楚格水电站的建设工程也在超计划地进行，第十台联动机（动力为五万七千二百瓩）已提前十天于9月18日开始发电。建设者们正在争取在十月革命四十三周年前夕使全部十二台水轮机运转起来。这里还受到兄弟企业的大力支援。哈尔科夫重型机器制造厂已为它及时制成了第十二台——最后一台联动机。
    除此以外，在哈萨克的布赫塔马河、雅库梯的威吕河、塔吉克的瓦赫什河、吉尔吉斯的纳林河以及其他许多河流上，水电站的建筑工程都在紧张进行中。
    据新华社布拉格讯　捷克斯洛伐克的冶金工业今年以来取得了显著的成绩。
    与去年同期比较，今年上半年生铁产量增加11.2％，钢增产10.5％，钢材14.5％。今年7月份与去年同时期相比，生铁增长9.8％，钢13.5％。
    今年以来，冶金工业方面有许多新的项目建成，并投入生产。其中包括两个炼焦炉，一个高炉，四个马丁炉，四个电炉，四条轧钢线和一条纵向焊接线。此外，还对很多冶金设备进行了改建和扩建。
    在冶金工人广泛开展技术革新运动的基础上，今年继续采用了很多新技术。例如，为提高生铁产量，今年建设了很多新的烧结机，增加了贫矿的利用率。在提高钢的产量方面，采用燃料油代替煤气，大大提高了热度，缩短了炼钢时间，为提高钢材产量，除使旧轧钢线机械化、生产专门化外，还新建了连续直进式轧钢线。
    在第三个五年计划期间（1961—1965年），捷克斯洛伐克的冶金工业将有更进一步的发展，钢产量将提高54％。很多重大的基本建设工程现在已经开始动工，例如，捷克斯洛伐克的第二冶金基地——东斯洛伐克钢铁联合企业的基本建设工程目前正在加速进行中。
    工人的热情劳动大大促进了冶金工业的发展。今年上半年，冶金工业部门参加社会主义劳动竞赛的职工人数占工人总数的71.8％。有一千五百四十七个集体，即占职工总数10％的职工参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，其中有七十九个集体已获得了这个光荣的称号。
    据新华社讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道，蕴藏着丰富的铅锌矿和其他贵重的有色金属矿的保加利亚南部罗多彼山区，近几年来变成了大规模工业建设的中心，新的采矿工程和选矿厂在这里一个接着一个地投入了生产，一个大型的铅锌厂已经在格尔假利建成。
    这里矿石的开采量，近几年来迅速增加，在1939年为九万六千吨，到1955年为一百三十四万吨，而今年的开采量将超过二百八十万吨。
    最近又在普罗夫迪夫附近的罗多彼山麓，开始建设第二个生产有色金属的大型联合厂。罗多彼的矿石大部分由这个厂加工，它将向国家提供大约三万吨锌、四万吨铅、六万吨硫酸，以及大量的金、银、铜、铋、钴和其他稀有金属。现在，罗多彼区已形成了保加利亚有色冶金工业的巨大中心。
    这个地区在解放前是保加利亚最贫困、最落后的地方，人们过着原始的畜牧生活。解放后，随着工业生产的发展，这个地区的面貌起了根本变化，新的城镇在成长，几百公里的公路把罗多彼山区的居民点也都同国内其他地区连接起来了。原来的牧民已经变成了矿山上的熟练技术工人。（附图片）
