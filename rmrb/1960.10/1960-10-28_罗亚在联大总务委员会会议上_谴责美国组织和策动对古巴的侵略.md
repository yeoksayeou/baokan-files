Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th. The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss whether to include in the General Assembly agenda the Cuban proposal accusing the "United States of Aggression Against Cuba" and the ten Arab countries' proposal accusing "British Aggression Against Oman."
    The Soviet Union agreed at the meeting to include the Cuban accusation in the General Assembly agenda and suggested that the accusation be discussed by the UN General Assembly in plenary session. Although the United States also expressed support for including the Cuban proposal in the General Assembly agenda, it firmly opposed discussion in the General Assembly plenary session. Under the manipulation of the United States, the General Committee rejected the Soviet Union's proposal and decided to refer the matter to the General Assembly's Political Committee for discussion.
    Cuban Foreign Minister Roa stated at the meeting that the aggression against the Republic of Cuba, funded and orchestrated by American imperialists and the U.S. Department of Defense, was imminent. Roa condemned the United States for using the 1954 method of armed intervention to overthrow Guatemala to invade Cuba, and demanded that the United Nations General Assembly plenary session promptly discuss the urgent issue of the United States' aggression against the Republic of Cuba, which threatens international peace and security. He said that this issue was too urgent and must be discussed by the General Assembly plenary session and could not be referred to a committee for discussion.
    U.S. representative Baco attempted to deny the U.S.'s crime of aggression against Cuba and slandered the Republic of Cuba. However, he could not refute any of the facts of U.S. aggression against Cuba listed by the Cuban Foreign Minister in his speech.
    Soviet representative Zorin supported the demands of the Cuban government. Zorin pointed out that the United States is not only interfering in Cuba's internal affairs but is also openly preparing for a large-scale armed attack on Cuba.
    Zorin said that the United Nations should prevent the tragedy of Guatemala from recurring. He pointed out that any attempt by the United States to repeat this shameful experience would have serious consequences for the cause of world peace, because now is different from the past, and now the peace-loving people of all countries stand on the side of Cuba, and they are determined to do everything possible to stop the new colonialist enslavement of the Cuban people. The Soviet representative suggested that the Cuban accusation against the United States be discussed in the United Nations General Assembly plenary session.
    The General Committee, yielding to the will of the United States, rejected the Soviet proposal by a vote of six to ten, with four abstentions. Those voting in favor were the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Libya, Iraq, and Yugoslavia; those voting against were the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Haiti, Costa Rica, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique; Venezuela, Sudan, Panama, and Ceylon abstained.
    The General Committee then passed the U.S. proposal with twelve votes in favor, three against, and five abstentions, deciding to submit the issue to the Political Committee for discussion.
    At the same meeting, the General Committee voted by fourteen votes in favor, two against, and four abstentions to include the issue of British aggression against the Sultanate of Oman, proposed by ten Arab countries, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tunisia, the United Arab Republic, and Yemen, in the General Assembly agenda. Those voting against were Britain, the defendant in the criminal colonial war being waged in Oman, and another colonialist country, France. The United States, Canada, Italy, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique abstained.

    罗亚在联大总务委员会会议上
    谴责美国组织和策动对古巴的侵略
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会25日下午举行会议，讨论把古巴提出的控诉“美国侵略古巴”的提案和十个阿拉伯国家提出的控诉“英国侵略阿曼”的提案列入大会议程的问题。
    苏联在会议上同意把古巴控诉案列入大会议程，并建议把这个控诉案交由联合国大会全体会议讨论。美国虽然也表示赞成把古巴提案列入大会议程，但是它坚决反对在大会全体会议上讨论。总务委员会在美国操纵下否决了苏联的建议，决定把这个问题推给大会政治委员会去讨论。
    古巴外交部长罗亚在会上发言指出，由美帝国主义者和美国国防部资助和策动的对古巴共和国的侵略迫在眉睫。罗亚谴责美国正在使用1954年以武装干涉推翻危地马拉的方法侵略古巴，要求联合国大会全体会议迅速讨论美国侵略古巴共和国、威胁国际和平和安全这一个紧迫的问题。他说，这个问题是太紧迫了，必须由大会全体会议进行讨论而不能转交一个委员会去讨论。
    美国代表巴科妄图抵赖美国侵略古巴的罪行，对古巴共和国大肆诽谤。但他反驳不了古巴外交部长在发言中列举的美国侵略古巴的任何一个事实。
    苏联代表佐林支持古巴政府的要求。佐林指出，美国不仅干涉古巴的内政，而且正在毫不掩饰地准备对古巴的大规模的武装进攻。
    佐林说，联合国应该防止重演危地马拉的悲剧。他指出，美国重复这一可耻的经验的任何企图都会给世界和平事业招致严重后果，因为现在不同于过去，现在在古巴这方面站着爱好和平的各国人民，他们有决心尽一切努力来制止对古巴人民的新的殖民主义奴役。苏联代表建议在联合国大会全体会议上讨论古巴对美国的控诉。
    总务委员会屈从美国的意旨以六票对十票，四票弃权否决了苏联的建议。投赞成票的是苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、利比亚、伊拉克、南斯拉夫；投反对票的是美国、英国、法国、加拿大、意大利、日本、巴基斯坦、海地、哥斯达黎加和蒋介石分子；委内瑞拉、苏丹、巴拿马和锡兰弃权。
    总务委员会接着以十二票赞成、三票反对、五票弃权通过了美国的提案，决定把这问题提交政治委员会讨论。
    在同一会议上，总务委员会以十四票赞成、两票反对、四票弃权通过把伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、突尼斯、阿拉伯联合共和国和也门十个阿拉伯国家提出的英国侵略阿曼教长国的问题列入大会议程。投反对票的是正在阿曼进行罪恶殖民战争的被告英国，和另一个殖民主义国家法国。弃权的是美国、加拿大、意大利和蒋介石分子。
