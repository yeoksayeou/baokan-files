    Basic Summary of the Victory Experience of the Chinese People's Revolution
    —Written for the Publication of Volume Four of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"
    Red Flag Magazine Editorial Department
    When summarizing the experience of the Paris Commune, Marx put forward a famous proposition: the working class cannot simply seize the existing state machine and use it to achieve its own goals.
    This famous proposition put forward by Marx runs like a red thread through Lenin's great work "State and Revolution."
    Lenin's break with the revisionists and opportunists of the Second International was mainly because he restored the original revolutionary face of Marxism on this most fundamental issue of proletarian revolution, and further enriched and advanced Marxism based on the new experience of the international proletarian struggle. The reason why those shameful leaders of the Second International became traitors was mainly because they abandoned and distorted Marx's theory on this issue. Therefore, as Lenin said: "It is impossible to unfold a struggle, to liberate the working masses from the influence of the bourgeoisie, especially from the influence of the imperialist bourgeoisie, without fighting opportunist prejudices concerning ‘the state’."①
    In order to continue elucidating the Marxist theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin had intended to use a relatively large amount of space in "State and Revolution" to summarize the experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, but he did not have time to do so because he was leading the October Revolution. Lenin later, in his other great work, "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," actually did the work he had originally intended to do. In this new work, he repeatedly argued for this fundamental principle of Marxism: for the proletarian revolution to achieve victory, it must destroy the old state machine of the warlord system and the bureaucracy, and replace it with a new, revolutionary state machine controlled by the people.
    The reason why the proletarian socialist revolution must destroy the old state machine of the warlord system and the bureaucracy and establish a new revolutionary state machine is that the old state machine serves the exploitative system, and is the main tool for the exploiting classes to protect their exploitative system and rule the people. If the proletariat and all the exploited classes want to overthrow the exploitative system, change the old relations of production, and establish socialist relations of production, it is fundamentally impossible if they do not first destroy the old state machine of the warlord bureaucracy, the main tool protecting the exploitative system. Lenin emphasized that "politics is a concentrated expression of economics,"② and this is the main significance.
    A certain production relation is the economic foundation of a certain society. What kind of production relation, what kind of economic foundation, determines what kind of superstructure. The political system and ideology are the superstructure of society, and the issue of the political system is mainly the issue of the state machine. It is impossible to change the old economic foundation of society without destroying the old superstructure, especially without smashing the old state machine. As far as the proletarian socialist revolution is concerned, it is impossible to gradually establish socialist ownership of the means of production, and it is impossible to gradually lay the socialist economic foundation. These views have been repeatedly explained in the classic works of Marxism-Leninism.
    Why was the great October Revolution able to achieve victory? It was because the Russian proletariat, under the leadership of Lenin's great Bolshevik Party, thoroughly smashed the old Russian state machine of the warlord system and the bureaucracy, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and established a new Soviet state machine, transforming the state from a tool for a minority of exploiters to oppress the majority into a tool for the majority to oppress the minority of exploiters.
    At the end of World War II and after World War II, the people's democratic systems in a series of countries in Europe and Asia were able to be established because the old state machines of the warlord system and the bureaucracy in these countries were destroyed by their own people, or with the help of the Soviet Red Army in pursuing and annihilating the German fascist bandits.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly pointed out that the Chinese revolution is a continuation of the October Revolution. Why was the great Chinese People's Revolution able to achieve victory? The reason is the same. If we had not overthrown the counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, and had not smashed the old state machine of the warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, how could this victory have been achieved? The victory of the Chinese revolution, in a large Eastern country, once again proved the Marxist-Leninist principles concerning the state and revolution.
    The specific historical conditions of revolutions in various countries are often not completely the same and often have differences. The specific process of the Chinese revolution in smashing the reactionary state machine and establishing a revolutionary state machine also has its own characteristics.
    The October Revolution was started by the Russian working class holding an armed uprising in the capital. The process of this revolution was to occupy the cities first and then the countryside. However, the Chinese revolutionary war, that is, the revolutionary war independently led by the Chinese Communist Party, which started in the autumn of 1927, first achieved victory in some rural areas on the basis of land revolution, and gradually expanded this victory, and then achieved victory in the cities. This process was also from establishing small revolutionary base areas in the countryside to developing into large revolutionary base areas, from establishing a few revolutionary base areas to developing into many revolutionary base areas, from encircling the cities from the countryside to finally seizing the cities.
    The above process illustrates that the Chinese people seized power, first in one area after another, one piece after another; the Chinese people smashed the reactionary state machine, first in one area after another, one piece after another. The Chinese proletariat and the Chinese people, through such a process of revolutionary development, experienced twenty-two years and achieved national victory, achieving their goals.
    This development path of the Chinese revolution was proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    When the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, at the instigation of imperialism, perfidiously launched a sudden counter-revolutionary attack on the revolutionary Chinese people in 1927, throwing the revolutionary people into a bloodbath of white terror, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, under the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong, "rose from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight."③ Comrade Mao Zedong applied the Marxist-Leninist method to specifically analyze the social and historical conditions of China at that time. He proceeded from the fact that China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal large country with extremely unbalanced political and economic development, and from the fact that the counter-revolutionary camp in China was not unified and was full of contradictions, and drew the following conclusions:
    (1) Many small rural revolutionary base areas can emerge, persist, and expand in a wave-like manner under the encirclement of the counter-revolutionary regime;
    (2) The people's armed forces and revolutionary base areas led by the Chinese Communist Party are the main form of the worker-peasant alliance in our country's democratic revolution, and the main form of struggle for our country's proletariat to lead the people of the whole country to strive for liberation;
    (3) The revolutionary base area is a great revolutionary position for the Chinese people in military, political, economic and cultural terms. The revolutionary people rely on such base areas to strike at the counter-revolutionary offensive, accumulate and temper their strength, and use it as a starting point for revolutionary offensive;
    (4) The existence and development of revolutionary armed forces and revolutionary base areas will inevitably raise the revolutionary consciousness of the masses of the people throughout the country, gradually shake the foundation of counter-revolutionary rule, and promote the high tide of the great revolution of the people throughout the country.
    Comrade Mao Zedong thus, based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, put forward a new formula for revolutionary development under Chinese conditions, thereby enabling the Marxist-Leninist theory of state and revolution to achieve new victories on the vast land of a large country in the East, and enriched it with new content.
    Comrade Mao Zedong constantly struggled to defend the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism on two fronts, against right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning adventurism.
    The original group of capitulationists represented by Chen Duxiu, after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, combined with the counter-revolutionary Trotskyists and became liquidationists. They declared that the Chinese revolution was over, believing that the Chinese people should not touch Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary state machine, but should only carry out legal activities centered on the slogan of the "National Assembly" under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, and shamelessly praised Chiang Kai-shek's various counter-revolutionary wars, while vilifying the peasant revolutionary war and peasant guerrilla war led by the proletariat as a "roving bandit movement" that was bound to fail. Comrade Mao Zedong refuted this counter-revolutionary nonsense of the Trotsky-Chen liquidationists, and upheld the banner of the Chinese people's revolution, believing that "a single spark can start a prairie fire." Although the revolutionary armed forces and the revolutionary base areas were still small at that time, and only in the countryside, they had strong vitality, and their future was immeasurable.
    On the other hand, in our revolutionary ranks, there was a group of petty-bourgeois "left"-leaning adventurers who occupied the party's leading organs for several years, suppressing a large number of correct leading comrades headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, preventing these comrades from raising their heads. The "left"-leaning adventurers denied the protracted and tortuous nature of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, and failed to see the development process of the Chinese revolution from small to large, from rural to urban, and were eager to seize large cities. They were unwilling to carry out the arduous work of accumulating revolutionary forces among the masses of the people, and fantasized that the Chinese revolution could achieve victory in one morning, and that Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary state machine could be fundamentally smashed after a single "decisive battle." "Left"-leaning adventurism, in fact, could not achieve the goal of overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, and could not truly strengthen the revolutionary forces. On the contrary, this kind of blind action could only lead to the weakening of the revolutionary forces and revolutionary positions. Comrade Mao Zedong, during the ten-year civil war period from 1927 to 1936, constantly opposed this anti-Marxist-Leninist "left"-leaning opportunist line, emphasizing that it was necessary to pay attention to establishing a solid foundation for revolutionary base areas in the countryside, "in order to stand invincible." Comrade Mao Zedong believed that first making the small rural base areas, which were still small in number at the beginning, persist and continue to expand and continue to develop, would be able to "gradually approach the acquisition of national power." Comrade Mao Zedong's victory in opposing "left"-leaning adventurism in 1935 quickly revitalized the revolutionary forces, which had been weakened to only one-tenth at the time, and ensured that the Chinese revolution embarked on a healthy development path.
    Based on the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism, Comrade Mao Zedong concentrated the goal of the Chinese revolution on smashing Chiang Kai-shek's counter- revolutionary state apparatus. Without smashing Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary state machine, it would be impossible to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, it was impossible to establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class based on the worker-peasant alliance, it was impossible to carry out any socio-political reforms, and it was even more impossible to transform the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of the entire victory of the Chinese revolution and said:
    "Summing up our experience, it can be focused on one point, that is, the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class (through the Communist Party). This dictatorship must be united with international revolutionary forces. This is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program."④
    What is dictatorship? Anyone who is unwilling to play deceptive tricks will admit such a truth that Marxism-Leninism has always pointed out, that is, as Lenin said: "Dictatorship means the rule of one part of society over the whole of society, and it rules directly through violence."⑤ There are various dictatorships with different natures. The most fundamental difference is: the dictatorship of a minority of exploiters over the vast majority of exploited masses, or the dictatorship of the vast majority of exploited masses over a minority of exploiters. The dictatorship of slave owners, feudal lords, and the bourgeoisie, although there are differences in form, all belong to the former type of dictatorship; the dictatorship of the proletariat, although there may be different forms in different countries, is always the latter type of dictatorship.
    Any dictatorship, if it does not directly rely on violence, cannot be realized or maintained. This is true of counter-revolutionary dictatorships, and it is also true of revolutionary dictatorships. What is violence? This is the army, the police, the courts, the prisons, etc.
    Lenin said in "State and Revolution": "The standing army and the police are the chief instruments of state power. But can it possibly be otherwise?"
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The state apparatus, including the army, the police and the courts, is the instrument by which one class oppresses another. It is an instrument of oppression for hostile classes, it is violence and not something 'benevolent'."
    Thus, things are very clear: if the Chinese people want to overthrow the counter-revolutionary rule, they must establish their own armed forces, and they must have a people's army. During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War": "According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and maintain it must have a strong army."
    The armed revolution against armed counter-revolution that the Chinese people have carried out for a long time is the process of constantly destroying the counter-revolutionary army and establishing a revolutionary army, the process of constantly smashing the counter-revolutionary state machine and establishing a revolutionary state machine, the process of constantly shrinking the counter-revolutionary ruling area and expanding the revolutionary base area and liberated area.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in the same article mentioned above: "The task of the proletarian parties in capitalist countries lies in educating the workers through long-term legal struggles, building up strength, and preparing to finally overthrow capitalism. There, it is a long-term legal struggle, using the parliamentary forum, economic and political strikes..." He also said that in those countries, "uprisings and wars should not be held until the bourgeoisie is truly incapable, until the majority of the proletariat has the determination to armed uprising and wage war, and until the peasant masses have voluntarily assisted the proletariat." However, China is in another condition. According to Comrade Mao Zedong, in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country like China, there is no parliament to use, and there is no legal right to organize workers to hold strikes. "In China, the main form of struggle is war, and the main form of organization is the army." This war is mainly a peasant war, and this army is an army mainly composed of peasants.
    We Communists know that even in capitalist countries, parliaments are only decorations for the bourgeois dictatorship. It is very foolish not to understand this. Of course, it is also foolish for a proletarian party not to use parliament as a tool to carry out legal struggles if necessary. In China, we say that there is no parliament to use, that our main form of struggle is revolutionary war, and that our main form of organization is the army. This absolutely does not mean that we should not use all possible conditions to carry out legal struggles. It would be foolish to think so. However, during the ten-year civil war, the "left"-leaning opportunists in our party did some foolish things.
    It is wrong to limit the revolutionary struggle to legal struggles, or to completely refuse to use that possible and necessary legal struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong has always severely criticized these mistakes.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has always believed that revolutionary parties should seize all opportunities, try their best to use the contradictions of the enemy, develop progressive forces, win over intermediate forces, and isolate reactionary forces. He opposed all one-sidedness. He said that our policy is "neither all alliance denying struggle, nor all struggle denying alliance, but a comprehensive policy of both alliance and struggle."⑥ However, during the ten-year civil war, the "left"-leaning opportunists adopted an extremely one-sided erroneous policy. They did not regard the reactionaries as the main target of attack, but called the intermediate forces the "most dangerous enemies" and regarded them as the main target of attack. They did not recognize the contradictions within the reactionary camp, let alone recognize the contradictions between the intermediate forces and the reactionary rule. Their formula was the opposite of the right-leaning opportunist formula adopted by Chen Duxiu in 1926 and 1927. At that time, Chen Duxiu's formula was: all alliance, denying struggle. At this time, the formula of the "left"-leaning opportunists was: all struggle, denying alliance. The "left"-leaning opportunists refused to use all opportunities for legal struggle. As a result, the policy they adopted did not isolate the reactionaries, but isolated themselves. Comrade Wang Ming, who had previously made serious "left"-leaning opportunist mistakes, became a right-leaning opportunist during the Anti-Japanese War. The right-leaning opportunists recognized the Anti-Japanese National United Front. However, what they accepted was Chen Duxiu's old formula: all alliance, denying struggle. Wang Ming distorted the party's Marxist-Leninist united front policy, and forgot Lenin's important instruction that the proletarian party must unconditionally maintain "the independence of the proletarian movement" when it allies with the bourgeoisie.⑦ Wang Ming denied the party's policy of independence and autonomy in the united front, did not agree with the independent and autonomous anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare led by the Communist Party, and did not agree with expanding and developing the people's armed forces and anti-Japanese base areas led by the Communist Party, but placed the main hope of China on the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, advocating that the people's armed forces, anti-Japanese base areas, and people's organizations should all be "unified" under the Kuomintang, that is, placed under the "unified" control of the state machine of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The characteristic of Wang Ming's right-leaning opportunist thinking and the line he adopted was that he did not touch and maintained the state machine of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. His conclusion was: China after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War could not be the world of the people, but could only be the world of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the two state machines played two completely opposite roles. The People's Liberation Army and the people's regime in the liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party were the main driving force of the national Anti-Japanese War and the main driving force of national social progress. The role played by the reactionary state machine of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang could only be to weaken, restrict, and strangle the anti-Japanese forces of the people. The Kuomintang reactionaries tried every possible means to sabotage destroy the revolutionary people’s state machine, and the sacred mission of the revolutionary people was to defend, develop and strengthen this revolutionary state machine, so as to achieve the revolutionary purpose of defeating Japanese imperialism and subsequently defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries who dared to attack the revolutionary forces. This was a struggle between two Chinese destinies and two Chinese futures.
    The struggle between the Marxist-Leninist line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the right-leaning opportunist line represented by Wang Ming was actually a struggle concerning two Chinese destinies and two Chinese futures. If Wang Ming’s right-leaning opportunist line had been implemented, even if the Chinese people had won the Anti-Japanese War, the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War would only have fallen into the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Chinese people would not have been able to win their own ruling power throughout the country, and they would not have been able to smash the arrogant plan of American imperialism to replace Japanese imperialism's position in China. On the contrary, because the Chinese Communist Party persisted in the correct line put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong among the Chinese people, so that the People's Liberation Army and the People's Liberated Areas continued to grow stronger, this not only guaranteed the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but also guaranteed that after Japan surrendered, it could quickly defeat the counter-revolutionary offensive of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the revolutionary people of all countries in the world, achieve the victory of the People's Great Revolution and establish the great People's Republic of China.
    When Comrade Mao Zedong was struggling against right-leaning opportunism, he repeatedly talked about the following truth: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."⑧
    Isn't this the case?
    From the time the Japanese imperialists surrendered to the time when Chiang Kai-shek launched a new full-scale counter-revolutionary civil war, the Chinese Communist Party conducted many negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek. Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to negotiate directly with Chiang Kai-shek and established an agreement on peaceful nation-building. The first article of the "Summary of the Talks between Representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" signed on October 10, 1945, was "on the policy of peaceful nation-building," which expressly stipulated "resolutely avoiding civil war." However, on the third day after this agreement was signed, namely, October 13, Chiang Kai-shek secretly issued the so-called "bandit suppression" order to attack the liberated areas. The Political Consultative Conference closed on January 31, 1946, but in less than ten days, on February 10, the Kuomintang secret agents sabotaged the celebration of the Political Consultative Conference at Jiaochangkou in Chongqing. From January to June 1946, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached three cease-fire agreements, but each agreement was immediately sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek's larger-scale military offensive.
    From the Xi'an Incident in 1936, through the Anti-Japanese War, until 1946, Chiang Kai-shek made a large number of pleasant promises to the representatives of the Communist Party and the people, not only admitting that civil war should be avoided, but also openly admitting that Kuomintang secret agent activities should be stopped. However, he always agreed to establish agreements on the one hand and issued promises to the people, while taking actions that fundamentally violated the agreements and promises. All agreements and promises were used by the reactionaries as a smokescreen for new steps to oppose the people, and they could be torn up at any time when they thought it was not necessary.
    Marxism-Leninism repeatedly points out this indisputable truth: reactionaries will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Everything reactionary is the same; if you don't hit it, it won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; as a rule, dust never vanishes of itself where the broom does not reach."⑨ In his article "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" written at the end of 1948, he recalled the history of Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage of negotiations and tearing up agreements: "Since the Xi'an Incident of December 1936, since the Chongqing negotiations of October 1945, and since the Political Consultative Conference of January 1946, how kind and righteous the Chinese people have been to this gang of bandits, hoping to establish domestic peace with them. But has all the good will changed even a iota of their class nature? The history of these bandits cannot be separated from American imperialism. ...Only by completely eliminating the Chinese reactionaries and driving the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of China can China have independence, democracy, and peace. Isn't this truth clear?" The Kuomintang reactionaries blocked all possible paths for socio-political reforms through peaceful means and always imposed civil war on the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek often proposed to the Chinese Communists: if you hand over your army, I will give you democracy and let you participate in the government. Right-leaning opportunists found these words of Chiang Kai-shek very appealing and were very interested in them. On the contrary, Comrade Mao Zedong often told us not to be fooled by Chiang Kai-shek. Is it possible to peacefully obtain democracy and political power under the conditions that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are constantly strengthening their counter-revolutionary state machine? This is obviously impossible.
    Right-leaning opportunists do not believe that the masses of the people are the creators of history, do not see the great power of the masses of the people, only see the seemingly powerful phenomenon of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, and do not see their weak essence. Right-leaning opportunists' illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang were actually frightened by their seemingly powerful forces. Marxists-Leninists despise this weak and incompetent attitude of right-leaning opportunists, and believe that their task is to expose the truth that reactionaries are strong in appearance but weak in essence, and to encourage the masses of the people to dare to struggle and dare to win. Comrade Mao Zedong precisely carried out such a task. When Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American imperialism, developed his army to more than four million people, that is, when the counter-revolutionary state machine of the Chinese big landlords and big bourgeoisie reached its peak, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries were nothing more than paper tigers, and the Chinese people should prepare, and have the strength, to overthrow the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, establish a new democratic China of the people, and make themselves the masters of the country.
    The development of the facts was just as Comrade Mao Zedong had predicted. The huge counter-revolutionary army led by Chiang Kai-shek quickly collapsed under the blows of the People's Liberation Army in more than three years.
    In the long-term revolutionary armed struggle, the Chinese Communist Party has always been constantly summing up experience and gradually advancing. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong's articles written in September 1946, "Concentrate a Superior Force to Destroy the Enemy Forces One by One," in October of the same year, "Summary of Three Months," in September 1947, "Strategic Policy for the Second Year of the War of Liberation," in December of the same year, "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," in March 1948, "Circular on the Situation," in November of the same year, "Major Changes in China's Military Situation," etc., timely summarized experience at various stages of the revolutionary war and guided the revolutionary war to achieve victory step by step. Based on the experience of the long-term revolutionary war in China, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the famous "Ten Major Military Principles," further concretizing the method of concentrating superior forces to destroy the enemy forces one by one, and achieving the goal of completely eliminating the Kuomintang army in a planned and step-by-step manner. The People's Liberation Army grew larger and stronger with each battle; Chiang Kai-shek's army became smaller and weaker with each battle. With the elimination of the main force of the Kuomintang reactionary army, the Kuomintang reactionary regime also collapsed.
    When Lenin was arguing with the traitor Kautsky, he pointed out: "No great revolution has ever taken place without the ‘disorganization’ of the army. And it cannot be otherwise. For the army is the most hardened instrument for supporting the old regime, the most solid bulwark of bourgeois discipline, upholding the rule of capital, and preserving and training among the toilers subservience and submission to capital."⑩ What Lenin was saying here is: without disorganizing the old counter-revolutionary army, without smashing this main component of the counter-revolutionary state machine, the oppressed classes cannot achieve their own liberation and cannot achieve their own ruling position. Lenin wrote these words after the October Revolution, more than forty years ago, but can it be said that these words are outdated? Of course not. In the more than forty years since the great October Revolution, there has been the revolutionary experience of a series of countries in Europe and Asia, the experience of the great Chinese People's Revolution, as well as the experience of various revolutionary struggles that the people of various countries are now carrying out, which have increasingly clearly proved and proved that Lenin's words have not been outdated, and have increasingly clearly proved and proved the vitality of the truth expressed in these words.
    The proletariat and the masses of the people seizing political power, smashing the old reactionary state machine, and establishing a new revolutionary state machine are one thing. After seizing political power, relying on this political power to carry out socialist transformation in terms of ownership of the means of production is another thing. These are two things that cannot be confused. There must be the former before there can be the latter. This is the case in the Soviet Union, in the socialist countries of Europe and Asia, and in the People's Republic of China.
    It is a muddled idea to confuse the working class seizing political power with the working class carrying out socialist transformation by peaceful means after seizing political power. This muddled idea conceals the most fundamental thing, which is what Lenin repeatedly clarified: "The fundamental question in every revolution is the question of state power."
    Historically, the revolutions of the people of all countries have been out of the demands of the people and are the result of the development of class struggle. These revolutions are revolutions in which certain oppressed classes overthrow certain oppressing classes and certain exploited classes overthrow certain exploiting classes within a country. Marxists-Leninists have always believed that revolution cannot be imported or exported. The view that revolution can be imported or exported is completely wrong. Imperialists and reactionaries of all countries slander the revolutions of the people of all countries in this way, but this slander cannot stop the advancement of the revolutionary movements of all countries and the occurrence of revolutions in all countries.
    No Marxist-Leninist party advocates that socialist countries use wars between countries to promote revolution. The Yugoslav Tito clique slanders socialist countries for using "wars between countries" to promote revolution, which is nothing more than nonsense to serve imperialism.
    The development of revolutionary forces and the victory of revolution in all countries are the fundamental factors in preventing imperialism from launching a world war and defending world peace. The victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China further strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, further strengthened the forces for defending world peace, and greatly frustrated the adventurous policies and plans of the imperialists to launch a new world war. The stronger the socialist camp, the more the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries develop, and the more countries achieve revolutionary victory, the more secure world peace will be. Modern revisionists and some muddle-headed people oppose the revolutions of various countries to world peace, saying that to defend world peace, one cannot carry out revolution. This view is completely absurd and fundamentally violates Marxism-Leninism.
    The revolutionary theory of Marxism has illuminated the path of human progress for more than a hundred years. More than forty years ago, under the leadership of the great Lenin, the proletariat first achieved revolutionary victory on one-sixth of the world's land. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," the Soviet Union, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, established through the October Revolution, established the faith of the people all over the world in socialist revolution. Up to now, socialist revolution has achieved victory on a quarter of the world's land and among a third of the world's population. The victory of socialist revolution is completely irresistible.
    Socialist revolution cannot achieve victory in all countries in the world at the same time. It will achieve victory separately and gradually due to the inherent reasons of various countries, the consciousness of the people of various countries, their own efforts, and their own revolutionary preparations. The people of all countries will inevitably reach their goals through their own struggles, through their own hands, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist theory of state and revolution, and under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist theory that the capitalist and imperialist system will inevitably perish and the socialist and communist system will inevitably win.

    中国人民革命胜利经验的基本总结
    ——为“毛泽东选集”第四卷的出版而作
    红旗杂志编辑部
    马克思在总结巴黎公社经验的时候，提出了一个著名的命题：工人阶级不能简单地掌握现成的国家机器，并运用它来达到自己的目的。
    马克思所提出的这个著名的命题，像一根红线一样，贯穿在列宁的“国家与革命”这部伟大的著作中。
    列宁同第二国际的修正主义者、机会主义者的决裂，主要地就是他在无产阶级革命的这个最根本的问题上恢复了马克思主义原来的革命面貌，并且根据国际无产阶级斗争的新经验，进一步地丰富了和推进了马克思主义。第二国际的那些可耻的领袖们之所以成为叛徒，主要地就是因为他们在这个问题上丢掉了和歪曲了马克思的学说。所以，正如列宁所说的：“如果不在‘国家’问题上反对机会主义偏见，就不能展开斗争，不能使劳动群众摆脱资产阶级的影响，特别是摆脱帝国主义资产阶级的影响。”①
    为了继续阐明马克思主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，列宁曾经打算在“国家与革命”中用比较大的篇幅总结一九○五年和一九一七年俄国革命的经验，但是，因为领导十月革命，没有来得及作。列宁后来在他的另一部伟大著作“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”中，实际上作了他原来准备作的这个工作。他在这个新的著作中，同样不断反复地论证了马克思主义的这个根本原理：无产阶级革命要取得胜利，就要摧毁旧的军阀制度和官僚制度的国家机器，用新的、掌握在人民手中的革命的国家机器去代替它。
    无产阶级的社会主义革命，所以必须摧毁旧的军阀制度和官僚制度的国家机器，建立新的革命的国家机器，就因为旧的国家机器是为剥削制度服务的，是剥削阶级保护他们的剥削制度、统治人民的主要工具。无产阶级和一切被剥削阶级，要推翻剥削制度，改变旧的生产关系，建立社会主义的生产关系，如果不首先破坏军阀主义官僚主义的旧的国家机器，不破坏这个保护剥削制度的主要工具，那是根本不可能的。列宁强调地说过，“政治是经济的集中表现”②，主要的意义就在这里。
    一定的生产关系是一定社会的经济基础。有什么样的生产关系，有什么样的经济基础，就有什么样的上层建筑。政治制度和意识形态就是社会的上层建筑，而政治制度的问题，主要就是国家机器的问题。不破坏旧的上层建筑，特别是不打碎旧的国家机器，就不可能改变旧的社会的经济基础。对于无产阶级的社会主义革命说来，就不可能逐步地建立社会主义的生产资料所有制，就不可能逐步地奠定社会主义的经济基础。这些观点，是马克思列宁主义的经典著作中反复说明了的。
    伟大的十月革命为什么能够得到胜利呢？就是因为俄国无产阶级在伟大的列宁的布尔什维克党的领导下，彻底打碎了旧俄的军阀制度和官僚制度的国家机器，建立了无产阶级专政，建立了新的苏维埃国家机器，使国家由少数剥削者压迫多数人的工具变成为多数人压迫少数剥削者的工具。
    在第二次世界大战末期和第二次世界大战以后，欧亚一系列国家的人民民主制度之所以能够建立，也是因为这些国家的旧的军阀制度和官僚制度的国家机器，被本国人民或者本国人民在追歼德国法西斯匪军的苏联红军的帮助下所摧毁。
    中国共产党中央曾经多次指出，中国革命是十月革命的继续。中国人民大革命又为什么能够胜利呢？道理是同样的。如果我们不推翻大地主大资产阶级的反革命专政，不打碎旧有的军阀、官僚、特务的国家机器，这个胜利怎么能够取得呢？中国革命的胜利，在一个东方大国中，又一次证明了马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的原理。
    各国革命的具体历史条件往往是不完全相同的，往往是有差别的。中国革命打碎反动的国家机器、建立革命的国家机器的具体过程，也带有自己的特点。
    十月革命，是由俄国工人阶级在首都举行武装起义开始的。这个革命发展的过程，是先占城市，后占乡村。但是，从1927年秋季开始的中国革命战争，即中国共产党独立领导的革命战争，是在土地革命的基础上，在一部分乡村中首先取得胜利，又逐步扩大这个胜利，而后才在城市中取得了胜利。这个过程也就是从在农村建立小块的革命根据地发展成为大块的革命根据地，从建立少数的革命根据地发展成为多数的革命根据地，从农村包围城市到最后夺取城市。
    上述这样的过程说明了：中国人民夺取政权，首先是在一块一块、一片一片的地区上夺取；中国人民打碎反动的国家机器，首先是在一块一块、一片一片的地区上打碎。中国无产阶级和中国人民，通过这样的革命发展过程，经历二十二年之久，取得了全国的胜利，达到了自己的目的。
    中国革命的这个发展道路，是毛泽东同志提出的。
    当一九二七年，蒋介石反动派在帝国主义的唆使下，背信弃义地对革命的中国人民进行突然的反革命袭击，把革命的人民抛入白色恐怖的血海以后，中国共产党和中国人民正是在毛泽东同志的旗帜下，“从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了”③。毛泽东同志应用马克思列宁主义的方法，具体地分析了当时中国的社会历史条件。他从中国是一个政治经济发展极不平衡的半殖民地半封建的大国这个事实出发，从中国的反革命营垒内部不统一和充满着矛盾这个事实出发，得出了以下的结论：
    （一）许多农村小块革命根据地能够在反革命政权的包围下发生、坚持和波浪式地向前扩大；
    （二）中国共产党领导的人民武装和革命根据地，是我国民主革命中工农联盟的主要形式，是我国无产阶级领导全国人民争取解放的主要斗争形式；
    （三）革命根据地是中国人民在军事上、政治上、经济上和文化上的伟大革命阵地，革命人民就是依靠这样的根据地，来打击反革命的进攻，积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，作为革命进攻的出发点；
    （四）革命武装和革命根据地的存在和发展，必然会提高全国人民群众的革命觉悟，逐步动摇反革命统治的基础，促进全国人民大革命的高潮。
    毛泽东同志就是这样根据中国革命的经验，提出了在中国条件下革命发展的新公式，从而使马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的学说在东方一个大国的广阔土地上得到了新的胜利，并且充实了新的内容。
    毛泽东同志在反对右倾机会主义和“左”倾冒险主义的两条战线上，不断地为保卫马克思列宁主义的革命学说而斗争。
    以陈独秀为代表的原来的一批投降主义者，在蒋介石叛变革命后，同反革命的托洛茨基派相结合，成为取消主义者。他们宣布中国革命已经完结，认为中国人民不应该去触动蒋介石的反革命国家机器，而只能在蒋介石的反动统治之下，进行以“国民会议”为中心口号的合法活动，并且无耻地歌颂蒋介石的各种反革命战争，而把无产阶级领导的农民革命战争、农民游击战争诬蔑为必将失败的“流寇运动”。毛泽东同志驳斥了托陈取消派这种反革命的胡言乱语，坚持了中国人民革命的旗帜，认为，“星星之火，可以燎原”，革命的武装和革命的根据地当时虽然还小，而且还只在农村中，但是它有强大的生命力，它的前途是未可限量的。
    另一方面，在我们的革命队伍中，当时有一批小资产阶级的“左”倾冒险主义者，他们在好几年内占领了党的领导机关，把以毛泽东同志为首的大批正确领导同志打下去，使这些同志抬不起头来。“左”倾冒险主义者否认中国革命斗争的长期性和曲折性，看不到中国革命必须经过的由小到大、由农村到城市的发展过程，急于夺取大城市。他们不愿意在人民群众中进行积蓄革命力量的艰苦工作，幻想中国革命可以在一个早上取得胜利，蒋介石的反革命国家机器只要经过一次“决战”就可以被根本打碎。“左”倾冒险主义，实际上并不能达到推翻蒋介石反动统治的目的，并不能真正壮大革命的力量。相反，这种盲目行动，只能招致革命力量和革命阵地的削弱。毛泽东同志在一九二七——一九三六年的十年内战时期，不断地反对了这种反马克思列宁主义的“左”倾机会主义的路线，强调地指出必须注意在农村中建立革命根据地的巩固的基础，“以求自立于不败之地”。毛泽东同志认为，首先使开始数量还是不多的农村小块根据地坚持下来，并且继续扩大，继续发展，就能够“日渐接近于全国政权的取得”。毛泽东同志在一九三五年反对“左”倾冒险主义的胜利，在当时革命力量削弱到只剩下十分之一的情况下，迅速地重振起来，保证中国革命走上了健全发展的道路。
    根据马克思列宁主义的革命理论，毛泽东同志把中国革命的目标集中在打碎蒋介石的反革命国家机器这一点上。如果没有打碎蒋介石的反革命国家机器，就不可能推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，就不可能建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，就不可能进行任何社会政治改革，更不可能使民主革命转变到社会主义革命。毛泽东同志总结全部中国革命胜利的经验说：
    “总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这个专政必须和国际革命力量团结一致。这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。”④
    什么叫专政？谁如果不愿意耍弄欺骗的把戏，那就会承认马克思列宁主义历来指出的这样一个真理，即列宁所说的：“专政就是社会上一部分人对整个社会实行统治，而且是直接用暴力来统治。”⑤有各种不同性质的专政。最根本的区别是：少数剥削者对绝大多数被剥削群众的专政，还是绝大多数被剥削群众对少数剥削者的专政。奴隶主、封建主、资产阶级的专政，尽管形式上有差别，但是都属于前一类专政；无产阶级专政，在不同的国家内也会有不同的形式，但是总归是后一类专政。
    我国的人民民主专政经历了两个不同的发展阶段。在一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以前，我国的人民民主专政，实际上是民主革命的专政，是在无产阶级领导下的以工农联盟为基础的几个革命阶级的专政，是中国人民对帝国主义走狗、买办阶级、封建阶级的专政。在一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以后，人民民主专政开始具有新的性质，实际上是社会主义革命的专政，是无产阶级的专政。
    任何一个专政，如果不直接凭借暴力，就不能实现，也不能维持。反革命的专政是这样，革命的专政也是这样。什么是暴力？这就是军队、警察、法庭、监狱等等。
    列宁在“国家与革命”中说：“常备军和警察是国家权力的主要工具，但是——难道可能不是这样吗？”
    毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说：“军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”
    这样，事情是很清楚的：中国人民要推翻反革命的统治，就必须建立自己的武装，必须有人民的军队。在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志在“战争和战略问题”一文中这样说过：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”
    中国人民在长时期中所进行的武装的革命反对武装的反革命，就是不断地摧毁反革命的军队、建立革命的军队的过程，就是不断地打碎反革命的国家机器、建立革命的国家机器的过程，就是不断地缩小反革命统治地区、扩大革命根据地和解放区的过程。
    毛泽东同志在上述同一篇文章中说：“资本主义各国的无产阶级政党的任务，在于经过长期的合法斗争，教育工人，生息力量，准备最后地推翻资本主义。在那里，是长期的合法斗争，是利用议会讲坛，是经济的和政治的罢工，……”又说，在那些国家，“不到资产阶级处于真正无能之时，不到无产阶级的大多数有了武装起义和进行战争的决心之时，不到农民群众已经自愿援助无产阶级之时，起义和战争是不应该举行的。”但是，中国是处在另一种条件下。照毛泽东同志说来，在中国这样一个半殖民地半封建的国家中，并没有议会可以利用，也没有组织工人举行罢工的合法权利。“在中国，主要的斗争形式是战争，而主要的组织形式是军队。”这种战争主要地是农民战争，这种军队是以农民为主要成份的军队。
    我们共产党人知道，即使在资本主义国家，议会也只是资产阶级专政的装饰品。不了解这一点，是很愚蠢的。当然，无产阶级的政党如果在必要的条件下，不去利用议会这个工具进行合法的斗争，那也是蠢事。在中国，我们说没有议会可以利用，我们的主要斗争形式是革命战争，我们的主要组织形式是军队，这绝不是说，不要利用一切可能的条件去进行合法的斗争，如果这样想，那也是愚蠢的。可是，在十年内战时期，我们党内的“左”倾机会主义者，就作了这样一些蠢事。
    把革命斗争局限于合法的斗争，或者完全拒绝利用那种可能的和必要的合法的斗争，都是错误的。毛泽东同志从来严厉地批评这些错误。
    毛泽东同志一直认为，革命的政党应当抓住各种时机，尽量地利用敌人的矛盾，发展进步势力，争取中间势力，孤立反动势力。他反对了各种片面性。他说，我们的政策，“既不是一切联合否认斗争，又不是一切斗争否认联合，而是综合联合和斗争两方面的政策”⑥。但是，在十年内战时期，“左”倾机会主义者采取了一种极端片面性的错误政策。他们不是把反动派当作主要打击的对象，而是把中间力量叫作“最危险的敌人”，当作主要的打击对象。他们不承认反动阵营内部的矛盾，更不承认中间势力同反动统治之间的矛盾。他们的公式同陈独秀在一九二六年和一九二七年采取的右倾机会主义公式相反。在那时，陈独秀的公式是：一切联合，否认斗争。在这时，“左”倾机会主义的公式是：一切斗争，否认联合。“左”倾机会主义者拒绝利用一切合法斗争的机会。结果，他们所采取的政策不是孤立了反动派，而是孤立了自己。原来犯过严重的“左”倾机会主义错误的王明同志，在抗日战争时期，变成了右倾机会主义者。右倾机会主义者，承认了抗日民族统一战线。但是，他们所接受的是陈独秀的老公式：一切联合，否认斗争。王明曲解党的马克思列宁主义的统一战线政策，忘记了列宁关于无产阶级政党在同资产阶级联盟的时候，必须无条件地保持“无产阶级运动独立性”的重要指示⑦。王明否认党在统一战线中的独立自主的方针，不赞成共产党领导下的独立自主的抗日游击战争，也不赞成扩大和发展共产党领导的人民武装和抗日根据地，而把中国的主要希望寄托于国民党的反动统治，主张把人民武装、抗日根据地和人民团体都“统一”于国民党，即放在国民党反动统治的国家机器的“统一”控制之下。王明的右倾机会主义思想及其所采取的方针路线的特点，就是不触动并且维护国民党反动统治的国家机器。他的结论是：抗日战争胜利后的中国，不能是人民的天下，仍然只能是蒋介石国民党的天下。
    在抗日战争中，两种国家机器，起了两种完全相反的作用。中国共产党所领导的人民解放军和解放区人民政权，是全国人民抗日战争的主要动力，是全国社会进步的主要动力。蒋介石国民党的反动国家机器所起的作用，则只能是削弱、箝制和绞杀人民的抗日力量。国民党反动派千方百计地企图破坏和摧毁革命人民的国家机器，而革命人民的神圣任务，就是保卫、发展和强化这个革命的国家机器，以达到打倒日本帝国主义并在随后打倒那敢于向革命力量进攻的国民党反动派的革命目的。这是两个中国命运、两个中国前途的斗争。
    以毛泽东同志为代表的马克思列宁主义路线，同以王明为代表的右倾机会主义路线的斗争，在实际上，也就是关于两个中国命运、两个中国前途的斗争。如果实行了王明的右倾机会主义路线，中国人民即使取得抗日战争的胜利，抗日战争的胜利果实，就只能落在蒋介石的手上，中国人民就不能够在全国范围内争得自己的统治权力，就不能够粉碎美帝国主义在中国代替日本帝国主义的地位的狂妄计划。反之，因为中国共产党在中国人民中坚持了毛泽东同志所提出的正确路线，使人民解放军和人民解放区不断地壮大起来，这就不但保证了抗日战争的胜利，并且保证了在日本投降以后，能够迅速打败美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的反革命进攻，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界各国革命人民的支持下，取得人民大革命的胜利，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    毛泽东同志在同右倾机会主义斗争的时候，反复地说到以下的真理：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”⑧
    难道事实不是这样吗？
    从日本帝国主义者投降以后到蒋介石发动新的全面的反革命的内战以前，中国共产党曾经和蒋介石进行了多次的谈判。毛泽东同志曾经亲自到重庆，同蒋介石直接谈判，成立了有关和平建国的协议。一九四五年十月十日签订的“国共代表会谈纪要”，第一条就是“关于和平建国的方针”，其中明文规定“坚决避免内战”。但是，在这个协定签订后的第三天，即十月十三日，蒋介石就秘密地颁发了向解放区进攻的所谓“剿匪”命令。一九四六年一月三十一日政治协商会议闭幕，但是不到十天，在二月十日，就发生了国民党特务在重庆较场口破坏庆祝政协大会的行凶事件。从一九四六年一月到六月，国共双方曾经三次成立了停战协议，但是，每一次协议，都随即被蒋介石更大规模的军事进攻所破坏。
    从一九三六年西安事变开始，经过抗日战争，直到一九四六年，蒋介石对共产党和人民的代表作过大量的动听的诺言，不但承认了要避免内战，而且公开承认要停止国民党的特务活动。但是，他总是一方面同意成立协议，向人民发出诺言，同时又采取同协议和诺言根本违反的行动。所有的协议和诺言，都被反动派当作进行反对人民的新步骤的烟幕，在他们认为不需要的时候，都是可以随时撕毁的。
    马克思列宁主义反复地指出这一条千真万确的真理：反动派是不会自动退出历史舞台的。毛泽东同志说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”⑨他在一九四八年底所写的“将革命进行到底”一文中，对蒋介石破坏谈判、撕毁协议的历史，作了以下的回忆：“从一九三六年十二月西安事变以来，从一九四五年十月重庆谈判和一九四六年一月政治协商会议以来，中国人民对于这伙盗匪曾经做得何等仁至义尽，希望同他们建立国内的和平。但是一切善良的愿望改变了他们的阶级本性的一分一厘一毫一丝没有呢？这些盗匪的历史，没有那一个是可以和美国帝国主义分得开的。……只有彻底地消灭了中国反动派，驱逐了美国帝国主义的侵略势力出中国，中国才能有独立，才能有民主，才能有和平，这个真理难道还不明白吗？”国民党反动派堵死一切用和平方法进行社会政治改革的可能道路，总是把内战强加在中国人民头上。蒋介石时常向中国共产党人提出：你交出军队，我就给你民主，让你参加政权。右倾机会主义者对蒋介石的这些话听得很有味道，很感兴趣。相反，毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，不能上蒋介石这个当。难道在蒋介石反动派不断加强他们的反革命国家机器的条件下，能够和平地获得民主吗？能够和平地获得政权吗？这显然是不可能的。
    右倾机会主义者，不相信人民群众是历史的创造者，看不见人民群众的伟大力量，只看见蒋介石反动派的貌似强大的现象，看不见他们的软弱的本质。右倾机会主义者对蒋介石国民党的幻想，实际上是被他们貌似强大的力量所吓倒。马克思列宁主义者鄙视右倾机会主义者这种软弱无能的态度，而认为自己的任务，是在于揭露反动派的外强中干的真相，鼓舞人民群众敢于斗争，敢于胜利。毛泽东同志正是执行了这样的任务。当蒋介石在美帝国主义的支持下将他的军队发展到四百多万人，即中国大地主大资产阶级的反革命国家机器发展到登峰造极的时候，毛泽东同志却深刻地指出，蒋介石反动派不过是纸老虎，中国人民应该准备，而且有力量，推翻蒋介石国民党的反动统治，建立人民民主的新中国，使自己成为国家的主人翁。
    事实的发展正如毛泽东同志的预言，蒋介石所率领的庞大的反革命军队，在人民解放军的打击之下，在三年多的时间内就迅速地崩溃了。
    中国共产党在长期的革命武装斗争中，总是不断地总结经验，逐步前进。在第三次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志在一九四六年九月所写的“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”，同年十月所写的“三个月总结”，一九四七年九月所写的“解放战争第二年的战略方针”，同年十二月所写的“目前形势和我们的任务”，一九四八年三月所写的“关于情况的通报”，同年十一月所写的“中国军事形势的重大变化”等等文章，在革命战争的各个发展阶段，及时地总结了经验，指导革命战争一步又一步地取得了胜利。毛泽东同志根据中国长期革命战争的经验，提出了著名的“十大军事原则”，进一步地具体化了关于集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的作战方法，有计划有步骤地达到全部消灭国民党军队的目的。人民解放军，愈战愈大，愈战愈强；蒋介石的军队，愈战愈少，愈战愈弱。由于国民党反动军队主力的消灭，国民党反动政权也就随之崩溃。
    列宁在同叛徒考茨基争论的时候，这样指出过：“没有一个大革命是不‘瓦解’军队的，而且不这样也不行。因为军队是保护旧制度的最顽固的工具，是维护资产阶级纪律、支持资本统治、保持并教育劳动者去作资本的奴隶的最坚固的柱石。”⑩列宁这里所说的就是：不瓦解旧的反革命的军队，不打碎这个反革命的国家机器的主要组成部分，被压迫阶级就不可能取得自己的解放，就不可能取得自己的统治地位。列宁这些话，是在十月革命以后写的，离开现在已经有四十多年了，但是，能不能说这些话是过时了呢？当然不能这样说。在伟大十月革命以后的四十多年内，又有欧亚一系列国家的革命的经验，中国人民大革命的经验，以及现在各国人民正在进行着的各种革命斗争的经验，都越来越明显地证明了和证明着列宁这些话并没有过时，越来越明显地证明了和证明着列宁这些话所表达的真理的生命力。
    无产阶级和人民群众取得政权，打碎旧的反动的国家机器，建立新的革命的国家机器，这是一件事。在取得了政权之后，依靠这个政权，在生产资料所有制方面进行社会主义改造，这又是一件事。这是不能混同的两件事。必须有前者，才能有后者。这一点，在苏联是这样，在欧亚各社会主义国家是这样，在中华人民共和国也是这样。
    如果把工人阶级夺取政权，同工人阶级在夺取政权之后用和平的方法进行社会主义改造这两件事混同起来，就是一种糊涂观念。这种糊涂观念，掩盖了一个最根本的东西，即是列宁所反复阐明的：“一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题”。
    历史上，各国人民的革命，都是出于人民的要求，都是阶级斗争发展的结果。这些革命，是一个国家之内某些被压迫阶级推翻某些压迫阶级、某些被剥削阶级推翻某些剥削阶级的革命。马克思列宁主义者历来认为，革命不能输入，也不能输出。那种认为革命可以输入或者可以输出的观点，是完全错误的。帝国主义者和各国反动派正是这样来诬蔑各国人民的革命，但是，这种诬蔑并不能阻止各国革命运动的前进和各国革命的发生。
    任何一个马克思列宁主义的政党，都不主张社会主义国家用国与国之间的战争来推广革命。南斯拉夫铁托集团诬蔑社会主义国家要用“国与国之间的战争”来推广革命，这不过是为帝国主义效劳的一种胡说。
    各国人民革命力量的发展和革命的胜利，是制止帝国主义发动世界战争、保卫世界和平的根本因素。中国人民大革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，进一步地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，进一步地壮大了保卫世界和平的力量，大大地挫折了帝国主义者企图发动新的世界战争的冒险政策和冒险计划。社会主义阵营越是强大，各国人民革命运动越是发展，取得革命胜利的国家越多，世界和平就越有保障。现代修正主义者和某些糊涂人，把各国革命同世界和平对立起来，说要保卫世界和平就不能进行革命，这个观点，是完全荒谬的，是根本违反马克思列宁主义的。
    马克思主义的革命学说，一百多年来一直照亮着人类前进的道路。在四十多年前，在伟大的列宁的领导下，无产阶级首先在世界的六分之一的土地上取得革命的胜利。正如毛泽东同志在“星星之火，可以燎原”一文中所说的，经过十月革命建立起来的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，树立了全世界人民对于社会主义革命的信仰。到现在，社会主义革命已经在全世界四分之一的土地和三分之一的人口中取得了胜利。社会主义革命的胜利是完全不可抵抗的。
    社会主义革命不可能同时在全世界一切国家中一下子得到胜利，而会由于各国社会内在的原因，各国人民自己的觉悟，自己的努力，自己的革命准备，分别地逐步地得到胜利。各国人民必将经过自己的斗争，经过自己的手，在马克思列宁主义的指导下，在马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的学说的指导下，在马克思列宁主义关于资本主义、帝国主义制度必将灭亡和社会主义、共产主义制度必将胜利的学说的指导下，最后地达到自己的目的。①“国家与革命”初版序言。②见“再论工会、目前局势及托洛茨基和布哈林的错误”。③见“论联合政府”。④“论人民民主专政”。⑤“论对马克思主义的讽刺和‘帝国主义经济主义’”第六节。⑥“论政策”。⑦见“民族和殖民地问题提纲初稿”。⑧“‘共产党人’发刊词”。⑨“抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针”。⑩“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”。
