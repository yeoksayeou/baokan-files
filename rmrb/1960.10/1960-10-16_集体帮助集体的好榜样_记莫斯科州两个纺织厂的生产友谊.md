    A Good Example of Collective Help for Collective
    ——A Record of the Production Friendship Between Two Textile Factories in Moscow Oblast
    By our reporter Chen Quanbi
    "Extending a hand of friendship to comrades, the experience we gain today, we will pass on to others tomorrow!" This was said recently by Rozhneva, a famous textile worker and Communist Labor Team leader at the Kubawo Textile Factory in Moscow Oblast, in a speech on Moscow Radio. This sentence expresses the feeling of all the factory's employees. The Kubawo Textile Factory is a factory with a reputation in the Soviet textile industry and is actively striving for the title of "Communist Labor Factory." For more than a year, this factory has enthusiastically helped the nearby Troitsk Woolen Cloth Factory, enabling the Troitsk factory to jump from a factory lagging behind in the competition to the ranks of advanced enterprises.
    The Kubawo factory is a very old factory. It was established 213 years ago, but people say that although the factory is old, the people are full of vigor, because 54% of the workers in the factory are involved in the movement to win the title of "Communist Labor Team," and more than a dozen work teams have already won this glorious title. Since the factory launched the Gaganova movement of advanced helping the backward, every worker and workshop has been thinking of ways to use their superior conditions to help individuals and units that are lagging behind in production. Some workers and work teams have put forward the slogan: "Don't let there be backward people and backward units around us!" Not only that, the whole factory also took the initiative to help the Troitsk factory, a colleague in the industry.
    Factory Director Yelofeev told reporters about their assistance to the Troitsk factory. He said that a year ago, the Gaganova movement had just started, and in order to respond to the slogan of advanced helping the backward, the factory decided to find a relatively weak unit in production to help. At that time, it was believed that the Troitsk factory in Moscow Oblast was a very good target. Because the factory's production had never been able to keep up, the product costs were high, the quality was low, the entire factory lacked an advanced working system and reasonable work quotas, and the progress of technological innovation was also slow. As a colleague in the textile industry and one of the nationally renowned advanced factories, the Kubawo factory felt that it had the responsibility and the conditions to give them a big boost in production. On February 16, 1959, the two factories signed a "Production Friendly Mutual Assistance" contract after a long period of preparation. The contract stipulated that the Kubawo factory should help the Troitsk Woolen Cloth Factory in six aspects: manufacturing new products, improving product quality, improving production and labor organization, using new production equipment, technical and cultural learning of workers, trade union work, and factory construction work. The Kubawo factory did what it said it would do, and every item was specified in detail, such as when it would be completed, who would be responsible for it, and according to what specifications it would be carried out.
    Factory Director Yelofeev showed us the mutual assistance contract between the two factories. It contained hundreds of detailed items, all of which had been completed on schedule. The larger ones included: manufacturing several new products, improving the dyeing quality of woolen cloth, overcoming the uneven warp threads of blended woolen cloth, and improving the raising quality of thick woolen cloth. The Kubawo factory also helped the Troitsk factory analyze the intensity of machine operation and the tension of worker operation, and then set new working systems and reasonable work quotas. In terms of using new equipment, the Kubawo factory taught the Troitsk factory how to use new dyeing machines, blending machines, and pneumatic edge line suction machines, and helped them manufacture transportation vehicles for weaving workshops, bobbins for weaving machines, and master automatic devices for warping and dyeing machines. In the process of helping, the Kubawo factory also learned some new production experiences from this brother factory, such as the woolen cloth transportation method in the dyeing workshop, the wetting method in the raising workshop, and the rapid system of combing and spinning processes.
    In the process of the Kubawo factory helping the Troitsk factory, a group of vanguards of collective help for collective emerged. They were not satisfied with fulfilling the obligations of the contract, but also went beyond the scope of the contract, using their spare time and rest time to help the other party as much as possible. These people were Trokunov, a mechanic from the automated production workshop of the Kubawo factory, Gikina, the foreman of the raising machine, Cherepanov, the director of the weaving workshop, and Korovanyeva, a calculation worker, and so on. These people couldn't wait to teach all their advanced technology to the Troitsk factory at once, and immediately turn the Troitsk factory into an advanced factory. In the past year or so, they have been to the Troitsk factory almost dozens of times. In the past six months alone, Trokunov has helped the Troitsk factory solve six key production problems. For example, blended containers had never been installed on the spinning machines of the Troitsk factory before, and blended spinning had to be done manually, which not only reduced production efficiency but also affected product costs. Trokunov used his spare time to manufacture dozens of such containers for them and helped them install them. In addition, Trokunov also helped install a pneumatic device for the combing machine to absorb edge lines. In the past, on the combing machine, there was a lot of waste wool and it flew everywhere, which not only wasted materials but also affected the health of workers. After the pneumatic device was installed, the waste wool could be immediately sucked back and used as a useful material, and the health of workers was also guaranteed. Take Gikina, the foreman of the raising machine, as an example. Gikina is an expert in producing new products in the Kubawo factory. She has always hoped to pass on her new achievements to others as soon as possible. In her spare time, she taught the workers in Troitsk how to manufacture several new products. Cherepanov, the director of the weaving workshop, also provided no small amount of help to the Troitsk factory. In addition to helping them overcome the uneven weft threads in the weaving workshop, he also helped them solve the problem of calculating workload, installed automatic calculation devices on the weaving machine, and the workload of the three shifts every day was clear. Calculation worker Korovanyeva used her advanced experience to help the Troitsk factory formulate new work quotas, calculate the method of awarding bonuses for exceeding production quotas, and accelerate the rotation speed of machines.
    There were more than just dozens of workers in the Kubawo Textile Factory who voluntarily helped the Troitsk factory in their spare time and on their days off! The mechanic Trokunov and others mentioned above are just a small part of these people. For the sake of a common cause, for the sake of helping a factory reach an advanced level, they are willing to sacrifice their rest time.
    In the past, the foundation of political and ideological work in the Troitsk factory was relatively weak, the party and league work was not active, and the political and technical learning of the workers was also perfunctory. Since the two factories signed a mutual assistance contract, the workers of the Kubawo factory often invited the workers of the Troitsk factory to participate in their own learning organizations and learning evenings. In these learning organizations and evenings, the workers discussed together the importance of learning, the role of learning in improving production, and how young workers should treat political and technical learning, and called on all young workers who have not participated in learning organizations to strive to improve their political level and technical knowledge. The learning of young workers in the Troitsk factory was driven by the Kubawo factory, they formally established their own learning organizations, consolidated the learning system, and also formulated a three-year plan, stipulating that the political and technical level of each young person should be improved to the level of secondary and specialized education within three years. The factory also created all the conditions for young workers to learn, such as changing the working system of clubs, libraries, canteens, and nurseries, building classrooms for factory schools, hiring teachers, and reprinting textbooks. The number of workers from the Troitsk factory participating in learning increased several times in half a year. The trade unions of the two factories also frequently exchanged experiences in leading socialist competitions and fulfilling production and savings plans, and jointly held production meetings and experience exchange meetings. The amateur cultural troupe and sports team of the Kubawo factory also frequently went to the Troitsk factory to perform.
    Today, the Troitsk factory has become an advanced factory. Not only is the production plan completed ahead of schedule every month and every quarter, but also the quality of the products produced is good, the cost is low, and the workers' enthusiasm for labor is unprecedentedly high.
    In the production competitions in the fourth quarter of 1959 and the first quarter of this year, the Troitsk factory won first place in Moscow Oblast and also won the oblast's mobile red flag. Now the Troitsk factory is striving to complete the seven-year plan two years ahead of schedule. Therefore, people say that the example of the Kubawo factory enthusiastically helping the Troitsk factory is an example for the entire Soviet textile industry and a model of collective help for collective.

    集体帮助集体的好榜样
    ——记莫斯科州两个纺织厂的生产友谊
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    “向同志们伸出友谊的手，我们今天得到的经验，明天就传授给别人！”这是莫斯科州库巴汶纺织厂著名的纺织女工、共产主义劳动队队长罗日尼娃不久前在莫斯科电台的一次讲话中说的。这句话表达了全厂职工的心意。库巴汶纺织厂是全苏纺织业中享有声誉并正在积极争取“共产主义劳动工厂”称号的工厂，这个厂一年多来热情地帮助了附近的特罗伊次克制呢厂，使特罗伊次克工厂由一个在竞赛中掉队的工厂一跃而列入了先进企业的行列。
    库巴汶工厂是一个很老的工厂。它成立在二百一十三年以前，但人们说，工厂虽旧，人却是朝气蓬勃的，因为厂里54％的工人都卷入了争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的运动，已有十几个工作队取得了这个光荣的称号。工厂自开展先进帮助落后的加干诺娃运动以来，每个工人、车间都在想办法利用自己优越的条件去帮助生产上落后的个人与单位，有些工人和工作队提出的口号是：“不让自己周围有落后的人和落后的单位！”不但如此，全厂还主动帮助了同行的特罗伊次克工厂。
    厂长叶洛菲也夫对记者谈到他们帮助特罗伊次克工厂的经过。他说，一年以前，加干诺娃运动刚刚开展，工厂为了要响应先进帮助落后的口号，决心找一个生产上比较薄弱的单位进行帮助。当时认为莫斯科州的特罗伊次克工厂就是一个很好的对象。因为这个工厂的生产一直赶不上去，产品成本高、质量低，整个工厂缺乏先进的工作制度和合理的工作定额，技术革新的进度也慢。库巴汶工厂作为纺织工业的同行，作为全国驰名的先进工厂之一，觉得自己有责任也有条件在生产上大大地拉他们一把。1959年2月16日，两个工厂经过长期的准备签订了“生产友好互助”合同。合同规定库巴汶工厂应在六个方面帮助特罗伊次克制呢厂，这就是：制造新产品、提高产品质量、改进生产与劳动组织、利用新的生产设备、工人的技术和文化学习、工会工作和工厂建筑工作。库巴汶工厂说到就作到，每一个项目都规定得很具体，什么时间完成、什么人负责、按照什么规格进行等等。
    叶洛菲也夫厂长让我们看了看他们两个厂的互助合同，那上面规定的细目足有几百项，而且都已如期完成了。其中较大的如：制造出好几种新产品，提高了呢料的染色质量、克服了混纺呢料经线不均的现象，改进了厚呢的起毛质量。库巴汶工厂还帮助特罗伊次克工厂分析了机器开动的强度和工人操作的紧张程度，从而定出了新的工作制度和合理的工作定额。在利用新设备方面，库巴汶工厂教会特罗伊次克工厂使用新的染色机、混纺机、气压边线吸线机并帮助他们制造织呢车间的运输车、织呢机上的线轴和掌握整经和染色机上的自动装置。库巴汶工厂在帮助的过程中也从这个兄弟工厂学习了一些新的生产经验，如染色车间的呢料运输法、起毛车间的湿润法和梳毛纺毛工艺过程的快速制度等。
    在库巴汶工厂对特罗伊次克工厂帮助的过程中，出现了一批集体帮助集体的尖兵，他们不以履行合同的义务为满足，还超出合同的范围，利用自己的工余和休息时间尽量去帮助对方，这些人就是库巴汶工厂自动化生产车间的机械师特罗库诺夫、起毛机工长吉金娜，织呢车间主任契列巴诺夫和计算工人科罗瓦涅娃等。这些人恨不得一下把自己的先进技术全部教给特罗伊次克工厂，立刻把特罗伊次克工厂变成先进工厂，他们在过去的一年多来差不多都到特罗伊次克工厂去过几十次。单是特罗库诺夫在过去的六个月中就帮助特罗伊次克工厂解决了六项在生产上的关键性问题。例如，从前在特罗伊次克工厂的纺毛机上没有安装过混纺容器，进行混纺都要经过手工操作，这样不但生产效率低而且影响产品的成本。特罗库诺夫利用工余时间为他们制造了几十个这样的容器，帮助他们安装起来。另外，特罗库诺夫还帮助安装了梳毛机吸取边线的风动装置。从前在梳毛机上，废毛出得多、而且到处飞扬，不但浪费材料，还影响工人的健康，安装风动装置后，废毛可立即吸回去作为有用的材料来使用，工人的健康也有了保证。再以起毛机工长吉金娜为例吧。吉金娜是库巴汶工厂一个生产新产品的能手。她一向是一有新成就就马上希望传授给别人的。她在工余时间教会了特罗伊次克的工人制造好几种新产品。织呢车间主任契列巴诺夫对特罗伊次克工厂的帮助也不小，他除了帮助他们克服织呢车间纬线不均的现象外，还帮助他们解决计算工作量的问题，在织呢机上安装了自动计算装置，每天三班的工作量都清清楚楚。计算工人科罗瓦涅娃用自己的先进经验帮助特罗伊次克工厂制订了新的工作定额、计算颁发超额生产奖金的办法和加快机器的轮转速度等。
    利用工余时间和休息日自愿帮助特罗伊次克工厂的工人，在库巴汶纺织厂何止几十个！上面提到的特罗库诺夫机械师等人不过是这些人中间一小部分。为着共同的事业、为着帮助一个工厂达到先进的水平，他们情愿牺牲自己的休息时间。
    过去，特罗伊次克工厂政治思想工作的基础比较薄弱，党团工作不活跃、工人们的政治与技术学习也流于形式。自从两个工厂签订互助合同以来，库巴汶工厂的工人经常请特罗伊次克工厂的工人去参加自己的学习组织和学习晚会，在这些学习组织和晚会中，工人们一道讨论了学习的重要性，学习对提高生产的作用以及青年工人应该怎样对待政治和技术学习等，号召一切没有参加学习组织的青年工人为提高自己的政治水平和技术知识而斗争。特罗伊次克工厂青年工人的学习被库巴汶工厂带动起来了，他们正式建立了自己的学习组织，巩固了学习制度，并且还订出了三年计划，规定在三年内把每个青年的政治与技术水平提高到中等与专科的水平。工厂也给青年工人创造了一切学习的条件，如改变俱乐部、图书馆、食堂和托儿所的工作制度，为工厂学校修建教室、聘请教员和翻印教材等。特罗伊次克工厂工人参加学习的人数在半年内增加了好几倍。两厂工会之间也经常交流领导社会主义竞赛和履行生产和节约计划的经验，共同召开生产会议和经验交流会等。库巴汶工厂的业余文工团和体育工作队也经常到特罗伊次克工厂去进行表演。
    如今特罗伊次克工厂已变成先进的工厂，不但生产计划按月按季提前超额完成，而且生产的产品质量好、成本低，工人们的劳动热情也空前高涨。
    在1959年第四季度和今年第一季度的生产竞赛中，特罗伊次克工厂获得了莫斯科州的首位，而且获得了州的流动红旗。现在特罗伊次克工厂正在为提前两年完成七年计划而斗争。因此，人们说库巴汶工厂热心帮助特罗伊次克工厂的例子，是全苏纺织工业的榜样、是集体帮助集体的模范。
