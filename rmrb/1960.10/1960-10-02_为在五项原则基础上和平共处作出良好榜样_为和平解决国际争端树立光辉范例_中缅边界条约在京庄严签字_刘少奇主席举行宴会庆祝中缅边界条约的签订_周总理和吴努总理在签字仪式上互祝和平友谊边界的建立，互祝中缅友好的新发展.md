Xinhua News Agency, October 1st. The Boundary Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma was signed in Beijing today.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Lin Biao attended the signing ceremony.

General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, also attended the signing ceremony.

Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke before the signing respectively.

Prime Minister U Nu pointed out in his speech: October 1, 1960, will be recorded in history as a special day. It is the day when a new chapter begins in the relationship between Burma and China. He said that the treaty to be concluded between our two governments will, for the first time in history, establish a fully demarcated and marked boundary between our two countries, a boundary of peace and friendship.

Prime Minister U Nu said: The work we are about to complete today is a natural and necessary development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly formulated by our two countries, and a step forward in the struggle for peace in the world.

Prime Minister U Nu warmly praised: The settlement of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue is due to the high degree of friendship, understanding, and mutual accommodation shown by both sides. He expressed, on behalf of the Government and people of the Union of Burma, respect for the friendly and understanding attitude taken by the Government and people of the People's Republic of China on this issue. He said, I am especially grateful to Premier Zhou Enlai, who is the chief architect of this treaty on the Chinese side. From the very beginning, Premier Zhou Enlai has been involved in the work related to the treaty. Throughout the negotiation process, he has maintained a friendly, humble, patient, and understanding attitude. Even when difficulties seemed insurmountable, he never lost these qualities.

Prime Minister U Nu also emphasized: The treaty to be signed is an agreement voluntarily reached by both parties to resolve the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. He said that it would be equally ridiculous for anyone to say that this treaty was imposed by the Burmese side and that the Chinese side was unwilling, or that this treaty was imposed on Burma by China.

Prime Minister U Nu finally emphasized: Today we are signing the treaty based on the principle of absolute equality and out of the conviction that concluding this treaty is in the highest interests of Burma, in the highest interests of Sino-Burmese friendship, and in the highest interests of peace in Asia and the world. May this treaty we are about to sign usher in a new era of closer friendship and deeper understanding between our two countries and peoples.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech: The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has opened a new chapter in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, set a good example for Asian countries to coexist peacefully on the basis of the Five Principles, and set a brilliant example for all countries in the world to resolve international disputes peacefully. The conclusion of this treaty is a great happy event for the people of China and Burma and the people of the world. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, Premier Zhou extended the warmest and most sincere congratulations to His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, His Excellency General Ne Win, and the fraternal Burmese people.

Premier Zhou said: The boundary issue between China and Burma was caused by the long-term policy of aggression of imperialism. In the process of discussing the settlement of the boundary issue, our two governments adopted an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual concession and conducted friendly consultations. This enabled the complex boundary issue to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by both parties. Premier Zhou said: Now, the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is about to be signed, and the Sino-Burmese boundary will be fixed in legal form. This is a victory for friendly cooperation between China and Burma, a victory for the friendly unity of the Asian people, and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Premier Zhou said: I sincerely thank His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu for the praise he just made for myself and my colleagues. I regard this praise as the sincere friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou said: At the time of the signing of the Boundary Treaty, I cannot but mention the efforts and contributions of the Burmese side. As early as 1954, His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu expressed his desire to resolve the Sino-Burmese boundary issue and has been making sincere efforts for this purpose. The succeeding Burmese governments have also made efforts to seek solutions to the boundary issue. In January of this year, His Excellency General Ne Win signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Burma and the Agreement on Boundary Issues with the Chinese government in Beijing, paving the way for a quick and smooth resolution of the boundary issue. Now, His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu has come to Beijing in person to sign this solemn and friendly Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with me on behalf of the two governments, so that the peaceful and friendly boundary that the people of China and Burma have long yearned for has finally been established. Premier Zhou expressed his high respect and heartfelt gratitude to the Burmese government and Burmese friends who have made valuable contributions to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

The signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty was held at the Great Hall of the People at 5:30 this afternoon. Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu signed the "Boundary Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma" respectively.

    为在五项原则基础上和平共处作出良好榜样　为和平解决国际争端树立光辉范例
    中缅边界条约在京庄严签字
    刘少奇主席举行宴会庆祝中缅边界条约的签订
    周总理和吴努总理在签字仪式上互祝和平友谊边界的建立，互祝中缅友好的新发展
    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约今天在北京签字。
    刘少奇主席，董必武副主席，朱德委员长，陈云、林彪副总理参加了签字仪式。
    缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军也参加了签字仪式。
    吴努总理和周恩来总理在签字前分别讲了话。
    吴努总理在讲话时指出：1960年10月1日将要作为一个特殊的日子载入史册。它是缅甸和中国之间关系的新的一章开始的日子。他说，我们两国政府就要缔结的条约，将使我们两国之间历史上第一次出现一条完全划定和标定的边界，这是一条和平和友谊的边界。
    吴努总理说：我们今天即将完成的工作，是我们两国帮助制定的和平共处五项原则的一项理所当然的和必要的发展，是全世界争取和平的斗争的一个进展。
    吴努总理热情地赞扬说：中缅边界问题的解决，是由于双方都表现了高度的友好、谅解和互让的精神。他代表缅甸联邦政府和人民，对中华人民共和国政府和人民在这个问题上所采取的友好和谅解的态度表示敬意。他说，我特别对周恩来总理表示感激，他是中国方面缔造这个条约的主要工程师。从最早的开始，周恩来总理就与问了和条约有关的工作。在这个问题的谈判过程中，他一直持着友好、谦和、耐心和谅解的态度。即使在困难看起来克服不了的时候，他也从没有失去这些品质。
    吴努总理还强调指出：即将签字的这个条约，乃是双方为解决缅中边界问题而自愿达成的协议。他说，如果任何人竟说这个条约是缅甸方面所强加，而中国方面是不愿意的；或者竟说这个条约是中国强加于缅甸，这都同样是可笑的。
    吴努总理最后还着重说：今天我们在条约上签字，是基于绝对平等的原则，而且是出于这样的信念，即缔结这个条约符合缅甸的最高利益，符合中缅友谊以及亚洲和世界和平的最高利益。愿我们即将签字的这个条约，在我们两国和两国人民之间开创一个友谊更密切、谅解更深刻的新纪元。
    周恩来总理在讲话时说：中缅边界条约的签订，在中缅友好关系史上开始了新的一章，为亚洲国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处作出了良好的榜样，也为世界各国和平解决国际争端树立了光辉的范例。这个条约的缔结，对中缅两国人民和世界人民来说，都是一件大喜事。周总理代表中国政府和中国人民，向吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下和亲如手足的缅甸人民，表示最热烈的、最诚挚的祝贺。
    周总理说：中缅两国之间的边界问题，是帝国主义长期侵略政策所造成的。我们两国政府在商谈解决边界问题的过程中，采取了互谅互让的态度，进行友好的协商。这就使复杂的边界问题迅速地得到了双方满意的合理的解决。周总理说：现在，中缅边界条约就要签订，中缅边界将用法律的形式固定下来了。这是中缅两国友好合作的胜利，是亚洲人民友好团结的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利。
    周总理说：我衷心感谢刚才吴努总理阁下对我本人和我的同事们所作的赞誉。我把这种赞誉看成是缅甸人民对中国人民的真诚友谊。
    周总理说：在边界条约签订的时候，我不能不提到缅甸方面的努力和贡献。早在1954年，吴努总理阁下就表示了解决中缅边界问题的愿望，并且一直为此作了真诚的努力。后来继任的缅甸政府，也曾为寻求解决边界问题的方案作过努力。今年1月，奈温将军阁下在北京同我国政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，为迅速而顺利地解决边界问题铺平了道路。现在，吴努总理阁下又亲来北京和我代表两国政府签订这一庄严而友好的中缅边界条约，使中缅两国人民渴望已久的和平友好的边界终于建立起来了。周总理对缅甸政府和为中缅边界条约的签订作出宝贵贡献的缅甸朋友们，表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    中缅边界条约的签字仪式今天下午五时半在人民大会堂举行。周恩来总理和吴努总理分别在“中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约”上签字。
    签字以后，双方热烈握手，并且举杯祝贺。
