Dalian, October 11th (From our correspondent in Lushun-Dalian) - The Dalian Port Authority has mobilized the masses to inspect and maintain loading and unloading machinery, continuously increasing the number of operating machines, which has powerfully ensured the smooth transportation of grain, steel, coal, and other materials to various locations.

The port's cargo throughput in the fourth quarter of each year accounts for about 40% of the annual plan. This year, the entire country is carrying out a production increase and frugality campaign centered on grain and steel, and the expected cargo volume will be even greater. To complete the fourth-quarter transportation tasks, the port's Party committee believes that it is necessary to further strengthen machinery management and increase the number of operating machines. Therefore, it was decided to delegate all fixed and mobile machinery in the port to the loading and unloading areas for management, mobilizing the masses to inspect and maintain the loading and unloading machinery. After the implementation of this measure, the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly stimulated, and loading and unloading workers have quickly launched a "four goods" movement to make good use of, repair well, manage well, and maintain the machinery. Since August, the number of operating machines throughout the port has increased by 40% compared to the previous period, and the cargo throughput has also increased significantly.

While vigorously focusing on the inspection and maintenance of loading and unloading machinery, the Dalian Port Authority has also paid attention to the ideological education of drivers and repair workers and improving the technical level of the workers. They organized political, cultural, and technical training classes, and adopted methods such as pre- and post-shift technical research meetings, technical seminars, on-site observation meetings, and experienced technicians mentoring new technicians, to carry out systematic education. This has fostered the idea that maintenance is more important than repair and a culture of exchanging experiences in caring for machinery among all workers.

    大连港务局发动群众维护装卸机械
    保证冬季重点物资运输畅通无阻
    本报旅大11日电　大连港务局发动群众检修保养装卸机械，不断增加出机台数，有力地保证了粮、钢、煤等物资畅通无阻地运往各地。
    这个港每年第四季度货运吞吐量要占全年计划的40％左右，今年全国各地又开展了以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动，预计货运量将更增大。为了完成第四季度的运输任务，港党委认为必须进一步加强机械管理提高出机台数。因此决定把全港固定和流动的机械，全部下放到装卸区管理，发动群众检修保养装卸机械。这一措施实行以后，大大发挥了群众的积极性，装卸职工迅速掀起了用好、修好、管好、养好的“四好”运动。8月份以来，全港的出机台数，比前期增多了40％；货物的吞吐量也都有了很大的增长。
    大连港务局在大抓装卸机械检修保养的同时，又注意了对司机员和修理工人的思想教育和提高工人的技术水平。他们组织了政治、文化、技术训练班，采取班前班后技术研究会、技术座谈会、机前观摩会和老技工带新技工的方法，进行了系统的教育。这样就在所有工人中间形成了保养重于修理的思想和交流爱护机械经验的风气。
