Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: In order to intensify its plot to interfere in Laos, the U.S. government has dispatched Assistant Secretary of State Parsons to Laos, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries to conduct activities, while also intensifying its use of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for conspiratorial activities.

According to a statement by U.S. State Department Press Officer Blair, Owen II, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, accompanied Parsons on his visit to Laos, Thailand, South Vietnam, and Cambodia. The U.S. State Department announced that the purpose of Parsons' trip was to "gather first-hand intelligence on the situation in these countries" and to "meet with" U.S. ambassadors to these countries.

According to a Thai newspaper report on the 7th, while the United States is using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intensify its planning for interference in Laos' internal affairs, Peters, the Deputy Secretary-General for Public Relations of the Central Treaty Organization, another aggressive group controlled by the United States, also arrived in Bangkok in early October to conduct activities. The newspaper revealed that the purpose of his visit to Bangkok was to discuss strengthening the "cooperation" and issues of "common interest" between the two aggressive blocs with officials from the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Another truck convoy of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has left Saigon for Savannakhet in Laos.

As early as August of this year, under the instigation of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique sent a truck convoy to Laos to supply weapons and food to the Nosavan rebel group, helping the rebel group oppose the Phouma government.
