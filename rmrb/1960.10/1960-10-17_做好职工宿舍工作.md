Doing a good job of ideological and political work while strengthening worker dormitories is a very important experience for improving the physical and mental health of workers and powerfully promoting production. Over the past eleven years, due to the rapid development of industrial production in our country, the number of workers has greatly increased, and the state has built a large number of dormitories for workers, doing a lot of work in arranging the lives of workers. Some cities, in order to make it easier for workers to live closer to factories, save commuting time, and also to make it easier for workers in the same factory and workshop to live closer together for production and learning, organized a city-wide adjustment of worker dormitories and strengthened the management and service work of the dormitories. Many worker dormitories, under the unified organization of the urban people's communes, have established canteens, nurseries, and living service stations. Relatively appropriate arrangements have also been made for workers' learning, cultural entertainment, and hygiene. Recently, many industrial cities, after adjusting their dormitories, immediately launched deeper and more meticulous ideological and political work in the dormitories; the Party committees of many cities and factories have repeatedly educated cadres to value dormitory work, and have mobilized Party and Youth League organizations at all levels, administrative and trade union organizations, to extensively mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job in worker dormitories. They have helped workers establish "Culture Rooms," "Workers' Homes," "Youth Homes," and "Red and Expert Homes" in the dormitories as venues for workers to study politics, culture, technology, and carry out cultural and recreational activities. They have also organized study groups on Party policies and Mao Zedong's works, guiding workers to use their spare time for meaningful learning and cultural entertainment activities. They have also mobilized the masses to establish some practical dormitory management systems, learning systems, hygiene systems, work and rest systems, and regular evaluation and inspection systems, so that dormitory work can move forward steadily. The news published in this newspaper today about the Red Flag Dormitory Movement launched by the Sichuan Rongchang Coal Mine, turning worker dormitories into a major front for communist education, is an example of dormitory political work being done relatively well.

Making appropriate adjustments to worker dormitories, separating workers from different factories, shifts, and workshops. This avoids the mutual interference and impact on the arrangement of spare time caused by different factories, shifts, different times for sleeping, going to work, resting, and entertainment, and people coming and going, talking and singing; it also avoids insufficient mutual understanding between different workshops, which hinders more effective ideological and political work. Giving workers a relatively quiet sleep time, so that they can rest well, have both work and leisure, and can work with full energy. Running the dormitory canteen well, so that workers on both day and night shifts can eat enough, eat well, eat hygienically, and eat frugally; in this way, they will inevitably have full strength to work. Doing a good job in the living service work for workers, gradually collectivizing workers' housework, paying special attention to helping dual-income families and single workers deal with trivial matters in life, so that they can concentrate on production and learning. Keeping the dormitories tidy and clean, and maintaining the quietness of the dormitories, and arranging the venues for cultural activities well, so that worker dormitories gradually have the conditions for smoothly carrying out learning and recreational activities, enabling workers to learn various policies, current political affairs, theory, science and technology, and literature and art with more peace of mind, and to participate in various sports activities and cultural entertainment activities more happily. This greatly enriches the political and cultural life of workers, improves their political standards and moral cultivation, and enhances their physical fitness, which also greatly increases the enthusiasm of workers for production. With such a lively and vivid ideological and political work, workers will inevitably accept it quickly and deeply, achieving twice the result with half the effort.

The Party and the state require every factory and mining enterprise to cultivate a worker contingent with high political consciousness, high cultural accomplishment, and physical and mental health while producing material products in greater, faster, better, and more economical ways. In addition to strengthening the ideological and political training of workers in production labor and various political activities, we should also create more convenient living conditions to ensure and promote workers to carry out spare-time learning and cultural entertainment activities more effectively. The working class bears the great mission of transforming the world, and therefore must constantly transform and improve itself, especially for young workers, who are the new force of the working class, and need to strengthen ideological and political work for them, so that they have the advanced ideology and feelings of the working class and the excellent communist qualities. A person's ideological situation in labor, work, study, and life is interconnected and difficult to separate. Workers who love learning and are good at arranging their lives improve quickly in learning, and are often advanced elements who love labor or work hard in production and work. Conversely, those workers who do not study well and do not arrange their lives well often perform poorly in production and work. Therefore, ideological and political work cannot only be carried out during working hours and only from the aspect of production labor. If we want to grasp deeply, meticulously, and comprehensively, we must go deep into the worker dormitories to carry out ideological and political work.

How can we make ideological and political work deep and meticulous? The practice of cadres moving into workers' collective dormitories and eating, living, working, studying, and entertaining with workers is very good. Cadres "five together" with workers, which makes cadres and the masses as close as family members, with mutual understanding. In this way, they can specifically organize workers of different levels and interests to carry out learning of various policies, current political affairs, theory, culture, science and technology, and literature and art, and specifically organize them to participate in cultural and recreational activities. If individual workers have ideological problems, they can have in-depth talks to help them analyze and understand, and help them deal with them correctly. If the masses have difficulties, the cadres will discuss solutions with them; if the cadres have requirements, the masses will come up with ideas and methods together. Cadres know the masses deeply, and the masses know the cadres deeply, so they can deeply study the problems in learning with each other, talk at any time, exchange opinions everywhere, and many problems in production, work, and life can be solved in a timely manner or reflected to the higher authorities for handling through such close cadre-mass relations, which not only guarantees that production can leap forward better, but also guarantees that the workers themselves can improve better.

After vigorously grasping the work of worker dormitories, many dormitories have seen an atmosphere of everyone loving to learn, spare-time life has gradually become richer, the habit of loving sports and cleanliness has also begun to be cultivated, and the new communist atmosphere of observing public order and unity and fraternity has also been promoted, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer. After ideological and political work went deep into the dormitories, the ideological outlook of workers and the production outlook of factories and mines have undergone great changes, there have been more achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution, and the quantity and quality of production have improved. This more powerfully proves that going deep into worker dormitories, vigorously grasping ideological and political work, and arranging life order well will surely play a greater and better role in promoting production.

    做好职工宿舍工作
    在加强职工宿舍工作中，注意大抓思想政治工作，是增进职工身心健康、有力推动生产的一项很重要的经验。十一年来，由于我国工业生产突飞猛进，职工数量大增，国家为职工修建了大量的宿舍，在安排职工生活方面作了许多工作。有的城市为了使职工住得离工厂近一些，节约一些上下班的时间，同时为了使同一工厂、同一车间的职工住得靠近，便于职工生产和学习，组织了全市职工宿舍大调整，加强了宿舍的管理工作和服务工作。有许多职工宿舍，在城市人民公社的统一组织下，办起了食堂、托儿所和生活服务站。对职工的学习、文化娱乐和卫生等方面也作了比较适当的安排。最近，好些工业城市，在调整宿舍以后，立即在宿舍中开展了更深入更细致的思想政治工作；不少城市和工厂的党委反复教育干部重视宿舍工作，并动员了各级党和团组织、行政和工会组织，广泛发动群众和组织群众来做好职工宿舍工作。他们帮助职工在宿舍里建立起“文化室”、“工人之家”、“青年之家”、“红专之家”等，作为职工学习政治、文化、技术以及开展文化娱乐活动的场地，还组织了党的政策和毛泽东著作学习组，引导职工把业余时间运用到有意义的学习和文化娱乐活动方面来。他们还发动群众建立了一些切实可行的宿舍管理制度、学习制度、清洁卫生制度、作息制度、定期评比检查制度等，使宿舍工作得以踏踏实实的前进。今天本报发表的四川荣昌煤矿展开红旗宿舍运动，把职工宿舍变成共产主义教育的一个主要阵地的新闻，就是宿舍政治工作做得比较好的一个例子。
    把职工宿舍作一番适当地调整，使工厂不同、班次不同、车间不同的职工分开来住。这样，就避免了工厂不同、班次不同，睡觉、上下班、休息娱乐时间不同，人来人往，说说唱唱，互相干扰和影响业余时间的安排；也避免了车间不同，互相了解不深，有碍更切实的进行思想政治工作。使职工有了比较安静的睡眠时间，职工休息得好，有劳有逸，就能精力充沛地进行劳动。再把宿舍食堂办好，使白班夜班的职工都吃得饱、吃得好、吃得卫生、吃得节省；这样，干起活来就必然全身是劲了。再把职工的生活服务工作作好，使职工的家务劳动逐步集体化，特别注意帮助双职工和单身职工处理生活琐事，使他们能够集中精力进行生产和学习。再把宿舍搞得整齐、清洁，而且保持宿舍的安静，把文化活动的场地安排好，使职工宿舍逐渐具备顺利进行学习和文娱活动的条件，使职工能够更安心地进行各项政策、时事政治、理论、科学技术和文学艺术的学习，能够更愉快地参加各种体育活动和文化娱乐活动。这样，就大大丰富了职工的政治生活和文化生活，提高了职工的政治水准和品德修养，增强了职工的体质锻炼，也就大大提高了职工的生产热情。这样生动活泼地进行思想政治工作，职工就必然会接受得快、接受得深，事半功倍。
    党和国家要求每一个厂矿企业都要在多快好省地生产物质产品的同时，培养出有高度政治觉悟的、有高度文化修养的、身心健康的工人队伍。我们除了在生产劳动中和各项政治活动中加强对职工的思想政治锻炼以外，还应当创造比较方便的生活条件，来保证和促进职工更有成效地开展业余的学习和文化娱乐活动。工人阶级担负着改造世界的伟大使命，因而必须不断地改造自己提高自己，特别是对于青年工人，他们是工人阶级新生的部分，更需要对他们加强思想政治工作，使他们具有先进的工人阶级的思想感情和优秀的共产主义的品质。一个人在劳动、工作、学习、生活等方面的思想情况是相互联系的，是很难分割的。爱好学习和善于安排生活的职工，在学习方面提高就快，在生产和工作方面，也常常是热爱劳动或者努力工作的先进分子。反之，那些不好好学习和不好好安排自己生活问题的职工，表现在生产和工作上常常也是比较差的。因而进行思想政治工作，就不能只在上班的时间，只从生产劳动一个方面入手。我们要抓深、抓细、抓全面，就必须深入到职工宿舍去进行思想政治工作。
    怎样才能使思想政治工作作得又深又细呢？干部搬进了工人集体宿舍和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐的作法很好。干部同职工“五同”，这就使干部和群众亲如家人，呼吸相通。这样就可以根据不同程度和不同兴趣的职工，具体组织他们进行各项政策、时事政治、理论、文化、科学技术和文学艺术的学习，具体组织他们参加文化娱乐活动。个别职工有思想问题，可以深谈，帮助他们分析、认识，帮助他们正确地去处理。群众有困难，干部就和他们一起商量解决；干部有要求，群众就来一起出主意想办法。干部深知群众，群众深知干部，彼此间就可以深入地研究学习中的问题，随时可以谈心，处处可以交换意见，许多生产中、工作中和生活中的问题，也就通过这样亲切的干群关系，及时解决或及时反映给上级去处理，这就不仅保证生产能够更好地跃进，而且保证职工本身能够更好地提高。
    大抓职工宿舍工作以后，许多宿舍都出现了人人好学的空气，业余生活也逐渐丰富起来了，爱体育、爱清洁的习惯也开始培养起来了，遵守公共秩序的和团结友爱的共产主义新风气也发扬起来了，干群之间的关系也更密切了。许多工厂在思想政治工作深入宿舍以后，职工的思想面貌和厂矿的生产面貌都发生了很大的变化，技术革新和技术革命的成就多了，生产的数量和质量都提高了。这就更有力地证明：深入职工宿舍、大抓思想政治工作，很好地安排生活秩序，必将对生产起更大更好的推动作用。
