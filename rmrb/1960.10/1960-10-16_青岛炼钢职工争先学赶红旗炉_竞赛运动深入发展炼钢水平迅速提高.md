Qingdao, October 15th. Qingdao's steelworkers are enthusiastically launching a competition to learn from and catch up with the Red Flag Furnace of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory, resulting in an excellent situation in the city's steel production. In early October, the city's average daily steel output increased by 30.27% compared to September, and the qualification rate increased by 11.54%.

At the end of August, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a steel production conference in Qingdao, requesting that the masses be mobilized throughout the province to launch a mass movement to learn from and catch up with the Red Flag Converter of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory. Workers of the 0.5-ton converter workshop of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory also proposed a friendly competition initiative to steelworkers throughout the province at this meeting. At the meeting, the Provincial Committee also stipulated the various standards for the Red Flag Furnace. In responding to the initiative of the Red Flag Furnace of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory, the city's steelworkers were full of enthusiasm, determined to achieve new achievements in high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption, and to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production plan.

In order to push this competition movement to a climax and rapidly improve the city's steelmaking level, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a Red Flag Furnace Competition Training Class in the 0.5-ton converter workshop of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory after the conference. A total of 987 people, including Party secretaries and factory directors of various steelmaking units in the city, Party branch secretaries and directors of workshops, as well as technical section chiefs, engineering and technical personnel, and workers of various types of work, participated in the study here. The participants combined theory with practice, first conducting "four comparisons," namely comparing ideology, comparing conditions, comparing targets, and comparing communist cooperation and continuous revolution. Everyone agreed that the advanced experience of the Red Flag Furnace of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory was mainly: first, strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, mobilizing the entire Party to do political and ideological work, and ensuring that workers have advanced thinking and a good style of communist cooperation; second, boldly mobilizing the masses to engage in technical innovation and technical revolution; third, resolutely implementing the technical policy of "strong wind, high temperature, and refined materials," especially being meticulous in raw material management; and fourth, having good organizational management work. During the study, everyone followed the work, personally operated the equipment, and combined thinking, doing, and seeing, and implemented what they learned immediately after returning, so that this advanced experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit in various units. Therefore, the steel production level of many units has rapidly improved. By the end of September, a number of steel converters in the city had reached or partially reached the Red Flag Furnace standards stipulated by the Provincial Committee. The Bicycle Factory not only imparted experience in the training class but also learned advanced experience from other units, so that steel production continued to lead.

Since entering October, steelworkers in the city have taken advantage of the excellent situation to further boost their energy and strive for excellence, pushing the Red Flag Furnace competition movement to a new climax. Party organizations in various units have further strengthened their leadership and conducted thorough and meticulous ideological and organizational work. The Qingdao No. 2 Steel Plant organized dozens of steelworkers to study at the Bicycle Factory again and organized more than 150 cadres to go to the workshops and furnace fronts to strengthen leadership in the first line. In early October, the daily steel output increased by 85.45% compared to September. Since October, the steelmaking workshop of the Qingdao Vehicle Factory has checked the implementation of the Red Flag Furnace experience every day and studied and applied the Red Flag Furnace experience every day. In leading the competition, the Party Committee grasped ideology, equipment, technology, and raw materials comprehensively, so that production continued to be high-quality and high-yield.

In this competition, various units also carried out a one-dragon competition between upper and lower processes within the factory, a collaboration competition between classes, and a technical performance competition. There were both Red Flag Furnace competitions and general furnace competitions, with Red Flag Furnaces helping general furnaces, and general furnaces catching up with Red Flag Furnaces, forming a crisscross competition network, which further promoted the in-depth development of the movement.

    青岛炼钢职工争先学赶红旗炉
    竞赛运动深入发展炼钢水平迅速提高
    本报青岛15日电　青岛市炼钢职工热烈开展学、赶青岛自行车厂炼钢红旗炉的竞赛运动，使全市炼钢生产出现了一派大好形势。10月上旬，全市钢的平均日产量比9月份增长30.27％，合格率提高11.54％。
    8月底，中共山东省委在青岛召开了炼钢生产会议，要求在全省范围内发动群众掀起学、赶青岛自行车厂炼钢红旗转炉的群众运动，青岛自行车厂零点五吨转炉职工，也在这次会上向全省炼钢职工提出友谊竞赛倡议。会上，省委还规定了炼钢红旗炉的各项标准。全市炼钢职工在响应青岛自行车厂红旗炉的倡议中，个个干劲冲天，决心夺取优质高产低耗的新成就，保证提前超额完成今年的炼钢计划。
    为了把这一竞赛运动推向高潮，以迅速提高全市炼钢水平，中共青岛市委会后就在青岛自行车厂零点五吨转炉工段成立了红旗炉竞赛训练班，全市各炼钢单位的党委书记、厂长和车间党支部书记、主任，以及技术科长、工程技术人员、各工种的工人等，共九百八十七人先后在这里参加了学习。参加学习的人员以虚带实，虚实并举，首先进行了“四比”，即比思想、比条件、比指标、比共产主义协作和不断革命。大家一致认为青岛自行车厂红旗炉的先进经验，主要是：一、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，全党动手做政治思想工作，职工有先进思想和共产主义协作风格好；二、放手发动群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命；三、坚决贯彻了“大风、高温、精料”的技术方针，特别是对原料管理得精细；四、组织管理工作好。大家在学习中，跟班劳动，亲自操作，想、干、看三结合，并且学了马上回去贯彻，使这一先进经验迅速在各单位开花结果。因此，许多单位的炼钢生产水平都迅速提高。到9月底，全市就有一批炼钢转炉达到或部分达到省委规定的红旗炉标准。自行车厂在训练班中不仅传授了经验，也学到了其他单位的先进经验，使炼钢生产继续领先。
    进入10月份以来，全市炼钢职工乘大好形势，进一步鼓干劲、争上游，把红旗炉竞赛运动推向了一个新的高潮。各单位党组织都进一步加强了领导，深入细致地进行思想工作和组织工作。青岛第二钢铁厂组织了几十名炼钢职工再到自行车厂学习，并组织一百五十多名干部下车间到炉前，加强第一线的领导，10月上旬钢的日产量比9月份猛增85.45％。青岛车辆厂炼钢车间10月份以来天天检查红旗炉经验的执行情况，天天学习运用红旗炉的经验，党委在领导竞赛中，思想、设备、技术、原料全面抓，使生产连续优质高产。
    在这场竞赛中，各单位也在厂内开展了上下工序之间的一条龙赛、班与班之间的协作赛、技术表演赛等，既有红旗炉竞赛，也有一般炉子的竞赛，红旗炉帮一般炉，一般炉赶红旗炉，形成纵横交错的竞赛网，更加促进了运动的深入发展。
