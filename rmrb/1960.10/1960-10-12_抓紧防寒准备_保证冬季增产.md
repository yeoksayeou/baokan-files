Xinhua News Agency, Anshan – Anshan Iron and Steel Company has put "overcoming the severe cold" and anti-cold work on the agenda during this pleasant weather, making preparations for a sustained leap forward in winter steel production.

Employees of many factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel are taking various measures to strengthen the protection of equipment vulnerable to severe cold. The anti-cold preparations of open-pit mining units and transportation departments are the key to ensuring a leap forward in winter steel production. To do this work well, the employees on Anshan Iron and Steel’s transportation front are launching a technical performance competition to tackle the "anti-cold over winter" challenge. They have successively proposed more than 1,500 innovative suggestions for transportation anti-freezing and thawing, of which 939 have been adopted and applied. In winter, freight cars transporting washed coal and refined ore powder from other places to Anshan are often frozen with a foot-thick hard shell, affecting unloading time. In response, the stevedores are vigorously reforming winter loading and unloading tools. They have already modified and produced 32 types of various thawing tools, such as thawing hammers, jacking tools, and steam furnaces, totaling 1,946 pieces. The stevedores have also summarized and learned from the advanced experience of unloading frozen cars over the years, and more than 3,000 people have learned three advanced techniques such as "explosive thawing" and "steam thawing." This has prepared them for quickly unloading frozen cars, supplying raw materials and fuel to production factories and mines on time, and ensuring the continued leap forward in steel production.

Employees of the Anshan Locomotive Factory conducted a major inspection and appraisal of all locomotives. Now, 80% of the locomotives have been inspected and appraised. All places where air valves leaked and flues leaked smoke have been completely repaired, ensuring that the locomotives' traction capacity will not be reduced in winter.

The miners fighting on the mountains are doing everything possible to ensure that power shovels and drilling machines can safely spend the winter on the mountaintops without reducing production efficiency, in order to produce more iron ore in winter.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin – The four major coal washing plants in Heilongjiang Province, namely Didao, Shuangyashan, Nanshan, and Xing’an, have made early winter anti-freezing preparations to ensure that a large amount of clean coal is transported to key enterprises such as Anshan without freezing, supporting a substantial increase in steel production.

At present, before the freezing period arrives, these four coal washing plants have basically completed the maintenance, renovation, and expansion projects of dewatering and drying equipment for clean coal. The complete set of dewatering equipment and the thermal drying workshop of the Jixi Didao Coal Washing Plant have been trial-operated before the National Day after several months of maintenance and expansion. The moisture content of a large amount of clean coal produced every day can be reduced to below 8% as required, which provides conditions for clean coal not freezing in the freezing period. The Transportation Department of Hegang Coal Mine has formed a "three-way combination" team of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to conduct in-depth inspections of main and branch lines, renovate and strengthen roadbeds prone to frost damage, repair winter anti-cold devices for mechanical and electrical vehicles, and provide winter safety technical education for transportation personnel to ensure smooth winter transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou – While striving to complete current transportation tasks, employees of various locomotive depots under the Lanzhou Railway Bureau are actively carrying out winter anti-cold preparations to ensure the successful completion of winter transportation tasks.

All locomotive depots have made early arrangements for winter anti-cold work. The Shizuishan Locomotive Depot started preparations two months earlier this year than in previous years. They first conducted a major quality appraisal and consultation for all locomotives in the depot, thoroughly "treated" locomotives that needed major repairs, and focused on detailed inspection and repair of places and parts of locomotives that are prone to failure in winter. To prevent any defective locomotives from being released, this depot also adopted the "three-way combination" method to form a "locomotive discharge consultation team" to re-repair locomotives that did not meet the winter quality standards. Under the guidance of the idea of ​​rushing forward in everything and striving to be proactive in everything, leading cadres of the Tianshui Locomotive Depot personally took command and fully mobilized the masses, and completed all locomotive grouting work as planned by September 10. The materials needed for anti-cold, such as felt, sacks, asbestos powder, and anti-corrosion oil, have also been basically prepared.

People's Daily, Karamay, 11th – Karamay's large-scale anti-cold and insulation project was basically completed by the end of September. 1,500 newly built indigenous insulation furnaces have been built, and a large number of oil wells, separators, oil tanks, and densely webbed oil and water pipelines have been equipped with anti-cold and insulation equipment. A large amount of insulation materials prepared for new wells and various projects to be put into production in winter have also been mostly transported to the site.

Karamay Oilfield’s anti-cold and insulation work this year has achieved four early stages: early summarization of experience, early arrangement of tasks and plans, early preparation of materials and equipment, and early start of construction. As early as May, shortly after the spring anti-cold and insulation work ended, the mine area leadership promptly mobilized the masses to summarize the anti-cold and insulation experience of last winter and this spring, comprehensively arranged the plans and measures for anti-cold and insulation, and launched preparations for anti-cold and insulation for this winter and next spring in the hot summer. Since late August, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration and the Karamay Mining Bureau have further strengthened the leadership of oilfield insulation work and established insulation offices and insulation headquarters. All oil production brigades, teams, and basic construction units have organized insulation teams and insulation classes according to plan. The mine area leadership has also transferred 600 workers from drilling, installation, and administrative service departments to strengthen the front line of insulation.

Xinhua News Agency, Jilin – Jilin Chemical Industry Company is stepping up its winter anti-cold preparations. So far, 90% of the company's anti-cold projects have been completed.

As early as July in midsummer, the company began preparing for winter anti-cold, and an anti-cold insulation agency was established under the leadership of the company's party committee. Later, anti-cold headquarters were established in various factories and workshops under the company, and anti-cold shock teams and shock groups were formed. The power engineers' offices, mechanical engineers' offices, production sections, and overhaul workshops responsible for equipment management in various factories conducted investigations on various anti-cold equipment by level and item, and made comprehensive arrangements for various anti-cold projects according to their importance and urgency.

Maintaining a normal chemical reaction environment under severe cold conditions is the main purpose of the company's anti-cold work. For this reason, the entire company has carried out a huge amount of insulation work. A large number of steam pipes and material pipes have been covered with insulation bricks and asbestos cement shells, and insulation boxes have been installed on the valves of the pipes. Manholes for upper and lower water pipes are covered with sawdust and grass bags, and outdoor storage tank compressors and water pumps have been repaired and equipped with insulation devices. The doors and windows of workshops and warehouses have also been repaired.

To ensure the supply of steam in winter, the company is carrying out a technical innovation movement centered on opening up new gas sources and saving heat energy. Before winter, the transportation and material storage departments of the company also took many measures to prevent cold. Every locomotive, freight car, and automobile in the company has been equipped with insulation equipment. To prepare for the transportation, loading, unloading, and storage of raw materials and materials in winter, the yards, thawing stations, and ore storage warehouses have been repaired.
