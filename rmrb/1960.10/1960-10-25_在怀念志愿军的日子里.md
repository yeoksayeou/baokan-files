　　In Days of Remembering the Volunteers
　　By Our Correspondent Shi Licheng
　　On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the second anniversary of their triumphant return to China, we visited the places where the Volunteers had fought and lived.

　　Entering the upper reaches of the Imjin River, we saw from afar a huge slogan shining brightly on a cliff among the green pines: "Long Live the Friendship Between China and Korea." This was built with white pebbles by the Volunteers and the Korean people with a feeling of reluctant farewell when the Volunteers triumphantly returned to China two years ago. Several Abaji (Korean for "uncle") told us that every day, the first rays of the rising sun in the east shine on these eight large characters first. After a rain, this slogan looks as brilliant as a rainbow in the sky. People who see this slogan naturally remember their Chinese relatives.

　　From so many heartfelt conversations with the Korean people, we know how the Korean elders cherish the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　An Amani's Heart
　　In Songjeong-ri, there is a 57-year-old Amani (Korean for "aunt") named Cui Wenhong. During the days of war, the old mother led the women in the village to repair bridges, mend roads, and care for the wounded Volunteers. To thank the old woman for her kindness, the Volunteers gave her more than a dozen photos. Amani clipped these photos together with photos of her own children in a frame and hung them on the clean wall, often taking them down from the wall to look at them for a long time. One late night, Amani looked at the photos for a while and gazed at the stars in the northern sky, and fell asleep without realizing it. But, in her dream, she dreamed of the dear Volunteers again. One night, she pointed to the photos of the Volunteer soldiers and said to her children: "These must be passed down, they are all our family members! If the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had not fought side by side to defeat U.S. imperialism, we wouldn't know if we would still be alive."

　　Old Mother Cui Wenhong held our hands and said with tears in her eyes: "I miss the Volunteers even more than I miss my own sons! I can see my sons, but when will I be able to see the Volunteers?" Someone advised her not to be too sentimental, and told her that the Volunteers had returned to their motherland to participate in the Great Leap Forward. Mother Cui opened her hands and said: "Chinese comrades are making a Great Leap Forward and are busy, so let those of us who especially miss the Volunteers go to China to see them!"

　　Korean Amanis all have the same feelings as Mother Cui in remembering the Volunteers. They often ask: Are the Volunteer comrades healthy? Where do they all live? Are they in the teams building Beijing? Did they participate in the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station? Did they make contributions in the Great Leap Forward?

　　Precious Gifts
　　In the days when the Korean people remember the Volunteers, they often take out the gifts left by the Volunteers and look at them again and again. The gifts include brocade and mirrors from Shanghai and Hangzhou, embroidered handkerchiefs from Hunan and Guangzhou, books, notebooks, and picture cards from Beijing, huqin (Chinese fiddle) from Liaoning, flower vases and pen holders made by Volunteer soldiers from shell casings, and shiny commemorative badges inlaid with Chairman Mao's image. Li Qinghuan, the Korean boy saved from the ice cave by Huang Zhifu, the "living Luo Shengjiao," after graduating from middle school in July this year, looked at the ballpoint pen, notebooks, bookmarks, and commemorative medals for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea given to him by Huang Zhifu under the light for a long time two days before he joined the People's Army. Finally, he put these precious gifts in a wooden box and handed them to his uncle Li Caixian, saying: "Uncle, I'm joining the army. These are my most beloved things, don't let anyone else touch them."

　　The Korean people cherish the copper spoons, copper bowls, benches used by the Volunteers, the trees they planted, the land they cultivated, and the flowers they planted as precious items. In Sanjuju, we saw the locust trees planted by the Volunteers on both sides of the road and the "China-Korea Friendship Forest" planted on Dongshan Mountain. Now the branches and trunks are thick, and the leaves are dense and two people tall. At the northern end of Dongshan Mountain, there are fifteen jeongbo (a unit of area) of paddy fields, which the local people call "treasure land," that were reclaimed by the Volunteers using the method of importing soil before they left. The stream beside the field gurgles, and the golden rice has been harvested and piled in the field.

　　The Cemetery Keeper
　　In the days of remembering the Volunteers, the Korean people have even deeper feelings for the Volunteer martyrs who rest on their land. During festivals, party and government leaders, workers, farmers, students, and soldiers of the People's Army bring wine and dishes, hold wreaths, and pay tribute to the heroic spirits. The several Volunteer Martyrs' cemeteries we visited were clean and fragrant with flowers everywhere.

　　On a sunny day after a rain, we came to the Wuling-ri Volunteer Martyrs' Cemetery. Here, the mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon) flowers are in full bloom, the pine and cypress trees and green grass are lush, the surrounding wooden railings are spotless, and the memorial arch stands majestically. From a hundred or so steps away, the twenty-two large characters on the memorial arch are clearly visible:

　　"Water the flowers with fresh blood, never to wither; Create great achievements for peace, forever to be remembered."

　　The old man guarding the cemetery is called Quan Xiangyi, and he is sixty-one years old this year. His brother, Quan Xiangye, used to guard the cemetery here. In the winter of 1957, Xiangye became seriously ill and called him to his side, saying: "Xiangyi, it doesn't matter if I die, but I can no longer clean the Volunteer Martyrs' Cemetery. You must do as I do and do your best for the Volunteer martyrs." Xiangyi followed his brother's last words, moved to the cemetery, swept away snow in spring, summer, autumn and winter, hoeed grass, drained water when it rained, and planted poles to support flowers and plants when there were strong winds. He sweeps the graves and cultivates the soil during the day, and sleeps in the cemetery at night.

　　The Power of Friendship
　　In the days of remembering the Volunteers, the Korean people redouble their deep feelings for socialist construction. All the places we visited had good harvests this year. Ox carts came and went on the main road, and the sounds of agricultural machinery threshing and winnowing could be heard from the villages from time to time.

　　On the way to Xinheung-ri, Won Gyeong-hee, vice chairman of the Ichon County People's Committee, looked at the abundant crops and said: "In the past, we always relied on foreign grain to survive the spring famine. This year, in addition to leaving enough rations for the whole county, we can also sell more than 500 tons of surplus grain to the state. The main reason why we have changed from a grain-deficient area to a surplus area is the correct leadership of the Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, who have focused on agricultural production. ... But, the friendship between Korea and China is also a force for our increased production. When members of the agricultural cooperatives are producing, they often shout: Bring out the energy of the Korean People's Army and the Volunteers to fight the enemy! Reclaim and cultivate land like the Volunteers! ..." A warehouse keeper of an agricultural cooperative named Li Bingxi told us: When the members of Zhishangdong receive tools, they scramble to use the two iron spades and hoes left by the Volunteers to cultivate the land. They said: Using the Volunteers' iron spades and hoes to cultivate the land gives them inexhaustible energy.

　　When we said goodbye to several Abaji and Amani, their warm hands were reluctant to let go of us for a long time. The Korean elders asked us to convey their feelings to their Chinese relatives with tender feelings. They said: "The better our lives become, the more we miss the Volunteers. The friendship between China and Korea will last forever!"

    在怀念志愿军的日子里
    本报记者　史立成
    在中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝作战十周年和凯旋归国两周年的前夕，我们访问了志愿军曾经战斗过和居住过的地方。
    进入临津江上游一带，远远地就望见山崖上、青松间一条巨大的标语铮明闪亮：“中朝友谊，与世长存”。这是志愿军两年前凯旋归国时，同朝鲜父老一起怀着依依惜别的心情，用白石子砌成的。几位阿爸基告诉我们，每天，东方升起的太阳，头道光芒首先照射在这八个大字上。若是雨后晴天，这条标语仿佛像空中彩虹那样灿烂夺目。看到这条标语的人，自然地怀念起中国的亲人们。
    从朝鲜人民这样许多次的倾心谈吐中，我们知道朝鲜父老是怎样怀念着中国人民志愿军。
    阿妈妮的心
    松亭里有一位五十七岁的阿妈妮崔文弘。在战火纷飞的日子里，老妈妈带领村里的妇女修桥、补路，看护志愿军伤员。志愿军为感谢老人家的恩惠，留赠给她十多张照片。阿妈妮把这些照片和亲生儿女的照片一起夹在镜框里，挂在洁净的墙上，并且常常从墙上摘下来久久地望着。一天深夜，阿妈妮看一会儿照片，望一会儿北方天际的星斗，不知不觉睡着了。但是，睡梦中，她又梦见了亲爱的志愿军。一天夜里，她指着志愿军战士的照片对儿女们说：“要把这些流传下去，这都是咱们家里的人！要不是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，打败美帝国主义，咱们还不知道在不在世上。”
    崔文弘老妈妈拉住我们的手，含着热泪说：“我想志愿军比想亲生的儿子还难受！想儿子能见到，想志愿军可什么时候能见到呀？”有人劝她老人家别过份感怀，还告诉她志愿军回到祖国参加了大跃进的行列。崔妈妈张开两手说：“中国同志大跃进，事情忙，那么让我们特别想念志愿军的人到中国去看看吧！”
    朝鲜阿妈妮们都有崔妈妈这样怀念志愿军的心情，她们常常问：志愿军同志都健康吗？他们都住在那儿？建设北京的队伍里有他们吗？他们参加了三门峡水电站建设吗？在大跃进当中立了功没有？
    珍贵的礼物
    朝鲜人民在怀念志愿军的日月里，常常拿出志愿军留赠的礼物，看了又看。礼物有从上海、杭州来的织锦、镜子、剪刀，湖南、广州来的刺绣花巾，北京来的书刊、本子、画片，辽宁来的胡琴，有志愿军战士用弹壳做的花瓶、笔筒，还有那嵌有毛主席像的金光闪闪的纪念章。“活的罗盛教”黄治富从冰窟中救出的朝鲜少年李清焕，今年7月中学毕业后去参加人民军的前两天，把黄治富赠给他的圆珠笔、本子、书签和抗美援朝纪念章，在灯光下看了好久。最后，他把这些珍贵的礼物装在一个木箱里，交给他的叔父李采先说：“叔叔，我参军去了。这是我最心爱的东西，不要让旁人动它。”
    朝鲜人民把志愿军使用过的铜勺、铜碗，坐过的板凳，栽的树，开的地，种的花，都当做珍贵的物品格外爱惜。在三巨洞，我们看到志愿军在道路两旁栽的洋槐树，东山上种的“中朝友谊林”，现在都是枝干粗壮，叶子稠密，有两人高了。东山北端，有十五町步被当地人民称做“宝地”的稻田，是志愿军临走前采用客土作业的方法开出的。田边溪水潺潺，金黄的稻子已经收割下来，堆在田间。
    守陵老人
    在怀念志愿军的日子里，朝鲜人民对安息在他们国土上的志愿军烈士，怀着更加深厚的感情。逢年过节，党政领导人、工人、农民、学生和人民军战士，带着酒和菜，捧着花圈，祭奠英灵。我们瞻仰的几处志愿军烈士墓，处处整洁，满园花香。
    在一个雨后初晴的日子，我们来到武陵里志愿军烈士陵园。这儿，无穷花开的正盛，松柏树和青草一片翠绿，四周木栏杆洁净如洗，牌楼巍然屹立，离百十步远就看清了牌楼上的二十二个大字：
    “用鲜血灌溉花朵千古不谢，为和平创造伟绩万古流芳”。
    看守陵园的老人叫全相亿，今年六十一岁。他哥哥全相业老人原来在这里看守陵园。1957年冬季，相业老人身染重病，把他叫到身边说：“相亿，我死了没有什么，只是再不能打扫志愿军烈士陵园了。你要像我这样做，对志愿军烈士尽到心。”相亿按着哥哥的遗嘱，搬到陵上，春夏秋冬，有雪扫雪，有草锄草，下雨时排水，刮大风时栽杆子扶植花草。白天扫墓培土，夜晚就在陵园睡。
    友谊的力量
    朝鲜人民在怀念志愿军的日子里，把深情厚意加倍地用在社会主义建设上。我们所走访的地方，今年全是好收成。大路上牛车来来往往，村庄里不时地传出农业机械脱谷、扬场的声音。
    去新兴里的路上，伊川郡人民委员会副委员长元景喜望着丰收的庄稼说：“这里过去一直靠外来的粮食度春荒。今年，除留下全郡足够的口粮还能卖给国家五百多吨余粮。我们缺粮区变成余粮区，最主要的原因是劳动党和金日成同志领导的正确，抓紧了农业生产。……可是，朝中友谊也是我们增产的一股力量。农业社社员们在生产的时候，常常喊：拿出朝鲜人民军和志愿军打敌人的劲头来！像志愿军那样开荒种地！……”一位名叫李炳熙的农业社仓库保管员告诉我们：支上洞的社员领工具时，抢着要用志愿军留下的那两把铁铣铁镐去种地。他们说：用志愿军的铁铣铁镐开地播种，身上就有用不完的劲头。
    我们和几位阿爸基、阿妈妮告别时，他们那热烘烘的手久久舍不得放开我们。朝鲜父老怀着绵绵情意要我们向中国亲人转达他们的心意。他们说：“我们日子越好过，越想念志愿军。中朝友谊，与世长存！”
