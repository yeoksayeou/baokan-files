The strikers demanded that wage contracts be concluded according to the workers' demands, that trade union leaders be released, that the government refrain from interfering in trade unions, that the recent fraudulent "elections" in the construction trade union be opposed, and that new elections be held. The strike leadership committee announced that the strike would continue if the workers' demands were not accepted.

    The striking workers pointed out in a communiqué that "the strike is proceeding victoriously throughout the country," and new wage contracts have been concluded in several parts of Argentina, increasing wages. In some important central cities in Argentina, some factory owners have begun to negotiate on the workers' demands.
