"Starting Small" Deserves Vigorous Promotion
	Zi Wan

	Recently, I read some thought-provoking news from newspapers and periodicals from various places:

	Wang Ren, a Communist Party member and veteran train driver at the Dahu Mountain Railway Station in Liaoning, has been picking up every screw, small cotter pin, and worn brake shoe he finds since liberation, treating them like treasures. Over time, along with the savings he has made through careful calculation in his daily work, their value is equivalent to building a "Construction Type" locomotive.

	The staff of the Datong Silk and Cloth Store in Shanghai have been racking their brains to create a set of cloth-saving methods. By using one foot less cloth for each pair of pants, they have saved more than 80,000 feet of cloth for the country and consumers in seven months.

	The Xiqiao Finance Office in Nanhai County, Guangdong, has established a "Envelope Savings Box" since 1957. Every day, the dispatcher and all comrades put used envelopes into the box. When needed, they take old envelopes from the savings box and reuse them. For more than three years, the envelopes saved in this way have basically met the office's needs.

	A screw, a foot of cloth, an old envelope—these seem small and insignificant, often overlooked. But when you calculate them carefully, they are actually very large and numerous. This tells us that small and large, few and many, are a unity of opposites. Small is the foundation of large, and large is the development of small. Few is the accumulation of many, and many is the beginning of few. Without small, there would be no large; without few, there would be no many. The ancients said, "Many a little makes a mickle," and "Trickling streams converge into rivers." Modern proverbs say, "One inch saved by one person saves a whole garment for a hundred," and "Grain is added to the mill one grain at a time, and money accumulates to ten thousand coins one cent at a time." These all speak to the same principle. A screw is not equal to a locomotive, and a foot of cloth is not equal to 80,000 feet of cloth. However, the locomotive that Comrade Wang Ren "picked up" started with picking up one screw. The more than 80,000 feet of cloth saved by the Datong Silk and Cloth Store in seven months was accumulated by saving one foot of cloth for each pair of pants. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to launch a production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, many units have proposed to have an eye on the big picture and start with small things, both "grabbing watermelons" and "picking up sesame seeds." This is absolutely correct.

	Regarding the issue of saving, some comrades believe that picking up a screw or saving a foot of cloth is a trivial matter, insignificant and not worth mentioning. They say, "We are now a large and prosperous country, and it doesn't matter if we spend a few more yuan." Some even ridicule comrades who start small as being petty and stingy. Besides not correctly understanding the relationship between large and small, many and few, these comrades have been tainted by the dust of exploiting class ideology. Their thoughts and feelings are gradually becoming different from those of the working people. Comrade Wang Ren, who "picked up" locomotives, wages a struggle whenever he sees waste. He says, "Others pick it up, but you throw it away. What does this mean? If everyone were like you, spending lavishly, how would we build socialism?" Xing Yanzi, an educated youth who actively participates in agricultural labor, once went to the commune to attend a cadre meeting, and the team gave her one yuan for food expenses. At the restaurant, she didn't buy any dishes or soup, only spent nine cents on some food, and returned the remaining ninety-one cents to the team. Someone asked her why she didn't buy any dishes to eat, and she said, "The team is still having difficulties. We should spend as little as possible." We believe that the excellent qualities of diligence and thrift, like those of Wang Ren and Xing Yanzi, are the true colors of the working people. The working people create all the material and spiritual wealth in the world, and they deeply know that every grain in their meal is hard-earned, and that any labor achievement is the result of their blood and sweat. Therefore, they save on everything and everywhere, cherishing every bowl of porridge, every stitch, and every thread. In the old society, the working people watched the wealth they created being plundered and squandered by the exploiting classes, while they themselves were forced to live on meager rations for half the year. In our new society today, the working people are masters of their own house, and their lives are getting better day by day. In order to build socialism and for a more beautiful and happy life, they still "regard diligence and thrift as honorable and extravagance and waste as shameful." They put a lot of thought into spending one yuan, especially spending one yuan of the country or the collective, thinking about how to make this one yuan play a greater role in the country's socialist construction.

	The exploiting classes are the opposite of the working people. Because they obtain things without labor, they do not cherish what they get and squander it at will, often flaunting their extravagance and waste to others. The rivalry between Wang Kai and Shi Chong, nobles of the Jin Dynasty, is an example. Wang Kai bought forty li of purple silk screen, and Shi Chong bought fifty li of brocade silk screen. Shi Chong smashed Wang Kai's three-foot-tall coral tree and took out his own coral tree, which was even taller than Wang Kai's. The waste in capitalist society is even more shocking. Capitalists and their families shamelessly squander the wealth earned by the working people with their blood and sweat. Henry Ford, the owner of the Ford Motor Company in the United States, emulated the fashion of 18th-century French nobles at the end of last year and spent $250,000 to hold a banquet to introduce his newly adult daughter into "society."

	Some comrades use the excuse of being "generous" and "magnanimous" to spend public money lavishly and do not pay attention to saving in their own lives. These comrades should compare themselves with the above examples to see whether their thoughts and feelings are close to those of the working people or to those of the exploiting classes.

	Of course, our advocacy of thrift is completely different from miserliness. Only among the exploiting classes will misers arise. They believe that money is omnipotent, and they are worshippers of money. They do not engage in physical labor, but specialize in exploitation, single-mindedly seeking money and loving wealth as their own lives. In the past, there were many landlords who saw a copper coin as big as a millstone, unwilling to spend it, but buried piles of it in the ground. Like Yan Jiansheng in "The Scholars," he was unwilling to light two lamp wicks when he was dying, and only closed his eyes when someone who understood his psychology trimmed one wick for him. These people are the real misers. Our advocacy of diligence and thrift does not mean not spending a cent. Necessary expenses should be spent, and unnecessary expenses should be resolutely avoided. Even necessary expenses should be spent properly, trying to spend less money and do more things, so that every cent is spent wisely. We must not only see the present but also see the future. In order to build socialism and realize the great ideal of communism, our lives should be more difficult, and we should save and store as much money as possible. This is not only beneficial to ourselves but also supports national construction. The comrades of the communications company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Lushun-Dalian are people with this high level of communist consciousness. For five years, no one in the entire company has eaten in a restaurant even once, their clothes have been mended again and again, and their shoes have been resoled again and again. In the eyes of those with exploiting-class ideas, this may seem too stingy, but they generously use their savings to support the rural people's communes. The soldiers of this company often say, "As long as the road to communism is not yet fully built, we should carry two more sleepers on our shoulders. As long as the people's lives are good, we feel the greatest happiness even if we are a little hardship." Everyone should learn from the comrades of this company, so as to promote the atmosphere of diligence and thrift in the production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, and constantly struggle against extravagance and waste. Everyone should, in the spirit of having an eye on the big picture and starting with small things, start by saving a grain of grain, an inch of cloth, a drop of water, and a unit of electricity. Save what can be saved, and gather thousands of drops of wealth, which will play a great role in accelerating my country's socialist construction.

### “从小处着手”值得大大提倡

    “从小处着手”值得大大提倡
    紫万
    最近从各地报刊上读到这样一些发人深思的消息：
    辽宁大虎山车站的共产党员、老火车司机王仁同志，从解放后直到现在，只要见到一个螺丝钉、一个小开哨、一个废闸瓦……，都当宝贝拣回来，天长日久，算起来，再加上他平时工作中精打细算所节约的，其价值可以造一台“建设型”的火车头。
    上海大同绸布店的工作人员，千方百计打主意，创造了一套节约用布的办法，做一条裤子少用一尺布，七个月来，他们为国家和消费者节约了八万多尺布。
    广东南海县西樵财政所，从1957年起，设立了一个“信封节约箱”。每天，收发员和全体同志都把已用过的信封放进箱里，要用时从节约箱里把旧信封取出来翻用，三年多以来，这样节约下来的信封基本上满足了所里的需要。
    一个螺丝钉，一尺布，一个旧信封，看起来很小很少，往往为人们所忽略；其实细细算一算，却是很大很多。这就告诉我们，小和大、少和多是对立的统一。小是大的基础，大是小的发展；多是少的积累，少是多的开始。没有小的也就没有大的，没有少的也就没有多的。古人说：“集腋成裘”，“涓涓之水，汇成江河”。现代的谚语是：“一人省一寸，百人省一身”，“粮是一粒一粒上石的，钱是一分一分上万的”。都是说的这个道理。一个螺丝钉，并不等于火车头，一尺布并不等于八万尺布。但是，王仁同志“拣”的火车头，却是从拣一个螺丝钉开始的；大同绸布店在七个月内节省的八万多尺布，却是由做每一条裤子节省一尺布所积累起来的。自从党中央发出开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动号召以后，许多单位提出大处着眼，小处着手，既抱“西瓜”，又拣“芝麻”。这样做是完全正确的。
    在对待节约的问题上，有些同志认为，拣一个螺丝钉，节省一尺布是区区小事，微不足道，何足挂齿。说什么“我们现在家大业大，多花几个钱也不在乎”。甚至讥讽从小处着手的同志是小里小气，太吝啬。这些同志除了没有正确认识大和小、多和少的关系以外，已经沾染上剥削阶级思想的灰尘。他们的思想感情和劳动人民的思想感情逐渐地不同起来。“拣”火车头的王仁同志，一看到别人有浪费就进行斗争，他说：“人家拣，你倒扔，这是啥意思，都像你这样大手大脚的，咱们怎样建设社会主义。”积极参加农业劳动的知识青年邢燕子，有一次去公社参加干部会议，队里给了她一元钱的伙食费。她到饭馆里，菜、汤什么都没有买，只花九分钱买了点吃食，把剩下的九角一分钱交回队里。有人问她为什么不买菜吃，她说：“队里还有困难，能少花一文，就应该少花一文。”我们认为，像王仁、邢燕子这种勤俭朴素的优良品质才是劳动人民的本色。劳动人民创造世界上一切物质财富和精神财富，他们深知盘中餐粒粒皆辛苦，任何劳动成果都是自己血汗的结晶。因此，他们事事节省，处处节省，珍惜一粥一饭、一针一线。在旧社会，劳动人民眼看自己所创造的财富，被剥削阶级掠夺去任意挥霍浪费，而自己却被迫过着糠菜半年粮的生活。在我们今天的新社会，劳动人民当家作了主人，生活一天天好起来；为了建设社会主义，为了更美好幸福的生活，他们仍然以“勤俭节约为荣，奢侈浪费为耻”。他们使用一元钱，特别是使用国家或集体的一元钱，都要费一番心思，怎样才能使这一元钱对国家的社会主义建设发挥更大的作用。
    剥削阶级同劳动人民正相反，因为他们不劳而获，所以他们对获得的东西毫不爱惜，任意挥霍，往往以奢侈浪费炫耀于人。晋代贵族王恺和石崇斗富就是例子。王恺购制紫丝布屏障四十里，石崇就购制锦绸屏障五十里；石崇把王恺高三尺的珊瑚树一击粉碎，拿出自己的珊瑚树比王恺的还高。资本主义社会的浪费就更加惊人了，资本家和他们的家族，荒淫无耻地大肆挥霍劳动人民用血汗挣来的财富。美国福特汽车公司的老板亨利·福特，去年年底仿效十八世纪法国贵族的风尚，为介绍他刚成年的女儿进入“社交界”，举行了一个宴会，就花了二十五万美元。
    有的同志借口要“慷慨”，要“大方”，花公家的钱大手大脚，自己的生活也不注意节约。这些同志应该用以上的事例对照一下，自己的思想感情是和劳动人民的思想感情相近，还是和剥削阶级的思想感情相近？
    当然，我们提倡节约，这和吝啬完全是两回事。只有在剥削阶级之中才会产生守财奴，他们认为金钱是万能的，他们是拜金主义者。他们四体不勤，专事剥削，一心捞钱，爱财如命。过去就有不少地主，把一个铜钱看作磨盘那么大，舍不得花，却一堆堆地往土里埋。像《儒林外史》中的严监生，临死的时候还舍不得点两根灯芯，非要懂得他的心理的人替他挑掉一根灯芯才闭上眼。这些人才是真正的吝啬鬼呢。我们主张勤俭节约，并不等于一文钱也不花，必要花的钱就花，不必要花的钱就坚决不花；并且就是必要花的钱也要花的得当，尽量做到少花钱，多办事，使每一文钱都花在刀刃上。我们不仅要看到眼前，而且要看到将来；为了建设社会主义，为了实现共产主义的伟大理想，自己的生活应该艰苦一些，把尽可能多的钱节约和储蓄起来，这不仅对自己有利，而且也支援了国家建设。驻在旅大市的中国人民解放军某部通讯连的同志，就是具有这种高度共产主义觉悟的人。五年来，全连没有一个人下过一次饭馆，衣服破了一次次地缝补，鞋子坏了一次次地换底。这在那些具有剥削阶级思想的人看来，也许太吝啬了，可是他们却毫不吝啬地把自己的积蓄支援了农村人民公社。这个连的战士常常这样说，“只要通向共产主义的大路一天没修好，我们的肩上就应该多扛两根枕木。只要人民生活好了，我们艰苦点，也觉得是最大的幸福。”我们每一个人，都应该向这个连的同志学习，从而在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，大兴勤俭节约之风，不断地同奢侈浪费现象作斗争。人人都要本着大处着眼、小处着手的精神，从节约一粒粮、一寸布、一滴水、一度电做起，能省的就省，把千万点点滴滴的财富汇集起来，这对加速我国的社会主义建设将起很大的作用。
