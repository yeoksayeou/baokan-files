    Meticulous Maintenance Ensures Safe Machine Operation
    Hebi Coal Mine Implements New Repair System, Greatly Reducing Machine Repair Downtime
    Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine Improves Driver Technical Skills, Significantly Increasing Overall Mine Machinery Utilization Rate
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 11th dispatch) The Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province is vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, which has greatly increased the operating time of electromechanical equipment in the entire mining bureau compared to last year, powerfully promoting the continuous leap forward in coal production.
    Hebi Coal Mine workers broke with the past practice of "centralized repair" of electromechanical equipment and established a set of "primary, fixed, rapid, zero" electromechanical repair regulations. "Primary" means proactively and systematically carrying out preventive maintenance, so that maintenance work precedes equipment failure, minimizing failures; "Fixed" means setting repair plans, including repair time, methods, measures, quality standards, and responsibility systems; "Rapid" means rapid, high-quality repairs; "Zero" means changing the past practice of centralized maintenance at the end of the month or on holidays to zonal, equipment-specific maintenance.
    Since the mine implemented the new electromechanical repair experience, it has saved sixteen to twenty-four hours of repair downtime each month, resulting in a new situation of "minor repairs without production stops, medium repairs without production cuts, and major repairs with rapid production resumption." Currently, the mine is increasing production by eight thousand to twenty thousand tons of coal for the state each month, just from the aspect of repairs without production stops.
    (Our newspaper, Fuxin, 11th dispatch) Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine is actively strengthening mechanical maintenance work, improving the technical skills of new and old drivers of various machines, significantly increasing the utilization rate of machinery throughout the mine, and ensuring a steady increase in coal production. From September 16th to 22nd, the average daily coal production increased by 24.2% compared to the first ten days of September.
    New drivers account for more than 60% of this open-pit mine, and they lack experience in maintaining machinery. After studying this situation, the mine's Party committee believes that in order to increase coal production, it is necessary to strengthen mechanical maintenance and repair work. Further improve the utilization rate of equipment. The key to improving equipment utilization is to improve the mechanical maintenance and repair technical skills of new and old drivers. In August, each section of the mine held various mechanical driver amateur training classes, where section chiefs, veteran drivers, and technicians imparted experience in mechanical maintenance and troubleshooting. Some sections and groups also regularly held accident review seminars to improve drivers' skills in maintaining machinery. Some also sent drivers to repair machinery with professional repair workers to learn repair techniques. After training in various ways, the technical level of mechanical maintenance for more than 800 mechanical drivers of electric shovels, electric locomotives, drilling machines, etc., throughout the mine has greatly improved; self-inspection, self-repair, and cherishing machinery have become conscious actions. As a result, the utilization rate of electric shovels throughout the mine has increased by 49% compared to the past, and the utilization rate of electric locomotives has increased by 45%.
    After many drivers have generally improved their mechanical maintenance skills, they can repair machines themselves anytime and anywhere, ensuring the normal operation of the machines quickly and well. After the drivers of the No. 6608 electric locomotive contracted team improved their technical level of self-inspection and self-repair, the time for each repair was shortened by more than half compared to the past. A new trend of cherishing and maintaining machinery has also emerged among drivers in production. Before and after work, they actively inspect, lubricate, clean, and scrub the machinery they use.

    精心维修  保证机器安全运转
    鹤壁煤矿推行检修新制度机电检修停产时间大大缩减
    海州露天煤矿提高司机技术水平全矿机械利用率显著提高
    本报郑州11日电　河南省鹤壁煤矿大力总结推广先进经验，使全矿务局机电设备运转时间比去年大大提高，有力地促进了煤炭生产的持续跃进。
    鹤壁煤矿职工打破过去“集中检修”机电的常规，建立起一套“主、定、快、零”机电检修的规章。“主”就是主动地、有计划地进行预防性检修，使检修工作走在设备故障的前面，把故障减少到最低限度；“定”就是定检修计划，包括检修时间、方法、措施、质量标准与责任制度；“快”就是快速高质检修；“零”就是变过去月末或假日集中检修为分区、分设备检修。
    这个矿推行新的机电检修经验以后，每月可节约检修停产时间十六至二十四个小时，出现了“小修不停产，中修不减产，大修快生产”的新气象。现在，仅检修不停产这一点，每月就多为国家增产八千至两万吨煤炭。
    本报阜新11日电　阜新海州露天煤矿积极加强机械维护工作，提高各种机械的新老司机的技术水平，使全矿机械利用率显著提高，保证了煤炭产量稳步上升。9月16日到22日的七天与9月上旬比较，平均日产煤量增长了24.2％。
    这个露天矿新司机占60％以上，他们缺乏维护机械的经验。这个矿的党委研究了这种情况以后认为：要增产煤炭，必须加强机械维护检修工作。进一步提高设备的利用率。提高设备利用率的关键是提高新老司机的机械维护检修技术水平。8月间全矿各段为此分别举办了各种机械司机的业余训练班，由工段长、老司机和技术人员传授机械维护和故障处理的经验。有的工段和小组还经常举行事故回忆座谈会，来提高司机的维护机械的技能。有的还派司机跟专业检修工人一起检修机械，实施学习检修技术。全矿八百多名电铲、电机车、穿孔机等机械司机，通过各种方式训练后，机械维护的技术水平大有提高；自检自修和爱护机械已成为自觉的行动。因而全矿电铲的利用率比过去提高49％，电机车的利用率提高45％。
    许多司机在普遍提高了机械维护的技术水平以后，随时随地可以自己动手维修，又快又好地保证了机械正常运转。六六零八号电机车包车组司机提高自检自修的技术水平后，每次检修的时间比过去缩短一半以上。司机们在生产中，还出现了爱护和维护机械的新风气。他们在上班前和下班后，都主动地对自己使用的机械，进行检查、注油、清扫和擦洗。
