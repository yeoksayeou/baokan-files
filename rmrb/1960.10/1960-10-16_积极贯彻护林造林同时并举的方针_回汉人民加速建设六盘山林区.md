    Actively Implement the Policy of Giving Equal Importance to Forest Protection and Afforestation
    The Hui and Han Peoples Accelerate the Construction of the Liupanshan Forest Area
    (Our Newspaper News) The Guyuan Special District of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, under the policy of "overall planning, strengthening nurturing, actively transforming, fully utilizing, and vigorously creating," is accelerating the construction and development of the Liupanshan forest area, striving to build this forest area into a timber base with high timber output and great economic value as soon as possible, so as to better serve the large-scale development of agriculture and grain production.
    Liupanshan is a famous mountain in Northwest China, spanning the Guyuan Special District in southern Ningxia and parts of Gansu. In Ningxia, it stretches across the entire Jingyuan County and the four counties of Longde, Guyuan, Xiji, and Haiyuan. Historically, it was a dense forest area. However, during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule before liberation, excessive deforestation severely damaged the forests. By the early days of liberation, only some natural secondary forests remained. Over the past eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic, under the leadership of the Party, the Liupanshan forest area has been rapidly restored and developed through the protection and construction efforts of the local Hui and Han people. Currently, on an area of approximately 2.2 million mu (within Ningxia) in this mountainous region, more than 410,000 mu of trees and shrubs are thriving and have begun to provide timber for national construction and agricultural production. Jingyuan County, where forests account for more than 40% of the county's area, had most of its forest areas reduced to remnants in the early days of liberation. Now, it has been transformed into a region with green mountains, clear waters, and abundant forests.
    In order to further transform, utilize, and improve this natural secondary forest area, and to build it into a timber base with high economic value as soon as possible, and on the basis of this forestry base, to expand forestry construction in a planned way, since the beginning of this year, the Guyuan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has especially strengthened its leadership over forestry construction in the Liupanshan forest area, established the Liupanshan Forestry Bureau to specifically manage and construct this forest area in a unified manner. At the same time, it vigorously implements a series of policies such as forestry "base-ization, forest farm-ization, high-yield-ization" and giving equal importance to forest protection and afforestation, as well as focusing on forestry, comprehensive management, and serving national construction and agricultural production. Thirteen state-owned forest farms have been established in the forest area, focusing on developing high-quality and fast-growing timber forests such as mountain poplar, birch, linden, Qinggang oak, and Huashan pine, while also developing fruit tree forests such as apple, pear, and peach trees, and economic forests such as mountain peach, Chinese prickly ash, and hazel trees.
    Now, the prelude to building Liupanshan into a timber base has been unveiled. Forestry personnel have settled in the mountains, and each forest farm and people's commune in the forest area are adopting the policy of giving equal importance to afforestation and forest protection, state-owned afforestation and commune afforestation, and are actively carrying out the work of building the Liupanshan forest area. A forestry resource survey team, after several months of trekking through mountains and rivers, has further conducted a detailed survey of the area, tree species, soil, and plant types in the forest area. A forest area road leading to the deep mountains and dense forests has also been basically completed. For mature timber trees that are old and decaying in the deep mountains, thinning and utilization are carried out in a planned manner, with a focus on forest cultivation. For the transformation and utilization of large areas of natural secondary forests and suitable barren mountains, the main measures taken are "four transformations," namely, transforming shrub forests into arbor forests, transforming inferior forests into high-quality forests, transforming non-forested land into sapling land, and transforming sparse forests into dense forests. In the "four transformations," the main approach is to rely on self-reliance, use local materials, and select and cultivate a large number of local trees with better wood quality and fast-growing timber trees, striving for rapid and high-yield forest production to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural construction. In the first half of this year alone, the state-owned forest farms in the forest area afforested more than 7,980 mu, nurtured more than 14,400 mu of established forests, produced more than 2,900 cubic meters of timber, and cultivated more than 180 mu of seedlings. They also grafted more than 54,000 apple, pear, and other fruit trees using the excellent fruit trees that are ubiquitous on the mountains. In addition, larch trees with good wood quality have been introduced from other places for planting trials.
    Under the policy of focusing on forestry and comprehensive management, each forest farm, based on the principle of simplicity, is engaging in diversified operations and actively processing and utilizing forest by-products. At present, forestry workers have established simple fiberboard and tannin extract processing plants using indigenous methods and have begun production. In addition, they are also vigorously developing planting and breeding industries, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and meat. Currently, each forest farm has planted self-sufficient grain and vegetables and raised many domestic animals, poultry, and deer. At the same time, they also produce a large number of farm tools and mountain products to support agricultural production. The counties and people's communes in the forest area are also, under the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations, established medicinal material processing plants, mountain product weaving factories, farm tool factories, bamboo ware factories, and non-staple food processing plants. Since the beginning of this year, the Jingyuan County Food Processing Plant has produced more than ten tons of wine using red peony seeds and leverwood seeds, saving the state 180,000 jin of grain. In the first half of this year alone, the mountain product and farm tool factories in this county produced more than 15,000 pieces of various large and small farm tools and wove 180,000 pieces of mountain products, not only achieving self-production and self-use but also supporting agricultural production in other areas.

    积极贯彻护林造林同时并举的方针
    回汉人民加速建设六盘山林区
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区固原专区在“全面规划，加强抚育，积极改造，充分利用，大力营造”的方针下，正在加速建设和开发六盘山林区，力争尽快地把这个林区建设成为一个木材产量高、经济价值大的用材林基地，以便更好地为大办农业、大办粮食服务。
    六盘山是我国西北地区的一座有名的大山，横亘在宁夏南部的固原专区和甘肃的部分地区，在宁夏地区绵延泾源全县和隆德、固原、西吉、海原等四个县境。它在历史上原是一个茂密的森林区，但是，解放前在国民党反动统治下，滥砍滥伐，森林遭到了严重的破坏，到解放初期，仅残存一些天然次生林。建国十一年来，在党的领导下，六盘山林区经过当地回汉族人民的防护和营造，得到了迅速的恢复和发展。目前，在这个山区约二百二十多万亩（宁夏境内）的面积上，已有四十一万多亩乔、灌木林欣欣向荣地成长起来，并开始为国家建设和农业生产提供用材了。森林面积占全县40％以上的泾源县，解放初期大部分林区形成残存林迹，现在已变成一个山青水秀，林木丰茂的地区。
    为了进一步改造、利用和提高这个天然次生林区，尽快把它建设成为一个经济价值高的用材林基地，并以这个林业基地为基础，有计划地扩大林业建设，今年以来，中共固原地委特别加强了对六盘山林区林业建设的领导，成立了六盘山林业局，专门统一经营和建设这个林区。同时大力贯彻林业“基地化、林场化、丰产化”和护林与造林并举，以及以林为主，综合经营，为国家建设和农业生产服务等一系列的方针政策，在林区内建立了十三个国营林场，以发展山杨、白桦、椴、青岗、华山松等木材质量高、生长较快的用材林为主，同时发展苹果、梨、桃等果树林和山桃、花椒、榛子等经济林。
    现在，把六盘山建设成为一个用材林基地的序幕已经揭开，林业人员已经上山落户，各林场和林区内各人民公社都采取造林和护林、国营造林和公社造林同时并举的方针，积极开展建设六盘山林区的工作。一支林业资源调查队，经过几个月的跋山涉水，已对林区的面积、树种、土壤、植物种类进一步作了详细的勘测调查；一条通往深山密林的林区公路也已基本修通；对于深山枯老的成材林木，也以育林为主，有计划地进行间伐、利用。对于大面积的天然次生林和宜林的荒山改造、利用方面，主要采取了“四改”，即改灌木林为乔木林，改劣质林为优质林，改无林地为幼林地，改疏林地为密林地。“四改”中主要采取自力更生，就地取材的办法，大量选育当地木质较好的树木和速生用材林，力求林木快速丰产，适应工农业建设需要。仅在今年上半年，林区内各国营林场已造林七千九百八十多亩，成林抚育一万四千四百多亩，生产木材二千九百多立方米，育苗一百八十多亩；还利用山上遍布的优良果树，嫁接苹果、梨等各种果树五万四千多株。另外，还从外地引进了木质良好的落叶松树进行种植试验。
    在以林为主，综合经营的方针下，各林场本着因陋就简的原则，大搞多种经营，积极进行林副产品的加工利用。目前，林业职工已办起了土法生产的纤维板、栲胶等加工厂，并开始投入生产。另外，还大搞种植业和饲养业，争取作到粮食、蔬菜、肉食自给。现在，各林场都种植了自给性的粮食和蔬菜，饲养了许多家畜家禽和山鹿。同时，还生产大批农具山货，支援农业生产。林区各县和人民公社，也在以粮为纲，发展多种经营的方针下，举办了药材加工厂、山货编织厂、农具厂、竹器厂和副食品加工厂等。泾源县食品加工厂今年以来就利用红芍子、杠木子制出了十多吨酒，为国家节约了十八万斤粮食。这个县各山货、农具厂今年上半年内就已生产各种大小农具一万五千多件，编织山货十八万件，不仅达到自产自用，还支援了外地的农业生产。（附图片）
