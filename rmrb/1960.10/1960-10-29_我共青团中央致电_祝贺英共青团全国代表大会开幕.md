    Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China today sent a telegram to congratulate the 23rd National Congress of the British Young Communist League, which will be held in London from the 29th to the 30th. The telegram said: “Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Great Britain, the British Young Communist League has waged unremitting struggles against imperialist aggression, to defend world peace, to strive for democracy and socialism, and to safeguard the vital interests of youth. Chinese youth are deeply concerned about and support your just struggle. We are excited about the achievements you have made.
    “The current world situation is very favorable to the forces of peace, democracy, and progress. However, the predatory imperialism headed by the United States is still stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and playing with ‘peace’ tricks. Therefore, the people and youth of the world need to unite, heighten their vigilance, and form a broad united front to resolutely oppose the aggressive and war forces headed by US imperialism, and strive for the victory of the lofty cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.
    “We wish your congress success! We wish you new achievements in your future struggles. May the friendship between the youth of China and Britain be increasingly consolidated and developed.”
