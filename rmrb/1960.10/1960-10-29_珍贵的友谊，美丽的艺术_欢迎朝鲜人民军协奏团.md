	Precious Friendship, Beautiful Art
	——Welcome the Korean People's Army Ensemble
	Li Wei
	Just as the Chinese people are commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to Korea to resist America and aid Korea with jubilation and excitement, the cultural envoys of the heroic Korean people—the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan—have been invited to visit and perform in our country. This will not only add luster to the cultural life of our people but will also play a significant role in further consolidating and developing the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged in blood, and in further developing the cultural and artistic exchanges between the Chinese and Korean peoples, which have the most time-honored historical traditions.
	Ten years ago, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, American imperialism brazenly launched the war of aggression against Korea and brought the flames of war to the Yalu River. Under the strong leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people bravely resisted the American aggressors. In order to "resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country," the Chinese people sent the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—to fight alongside the Korean people. Finally, the Korean and Chinese people defeated the seemingly powerful American aggressors and completely exposed the true face of the paper tiger. In this just war, the heroic Korean people made tremendous contributions to opposing aggression and defending world peace, and were unanimously praised and respected by peace-loving people all over the world.
	The friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is the friendship of two major nations who are as close as lips and teeth, the friendship of the outstanding sons and daughters of the two countries who are fighting together to safeguard the cause of the people's liberation and the victorious achievements of socialism, and the friendship forged in blood. In the years when the Chinese and Korean peoples jointly resisted the American aggressors, the Korean people treated every officer and soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers as if they were their own children and siblings, giving them great support and meticulous care, and some even sacrificed their most precious lives. The Chinese people will never forget this deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people.
	The Korean People's Army Ensemble is an artistic team composed of young people with artistic talents and excellent qualities selected from the soldiers of the Korean People's Army. From the day it was founded on February 8, 1948, they have become a powerful assistant to the Party in carrying out political work in the army. During the war to defend the motherland and resist American aggressors, they always fought heroically on the front lines with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army. They not only used majestic songs and joyful dances to encourage the fighting spirit of the soldiers, but also directly fought when necessary, carrying out heroic struggles against the enemy. During the period of peaceful construction, in addition to often going deep into the companies to teach soldiers to sing and dance and performing for the soldiers, they also often went to factories and rural areas to perform for workers and peasants. Therefore, the Korean People's Army Ensemble has been loved by the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people.

    珍贵的友谊，美丽的艺术
    ——欢迎朝鲜人民军协奏团
    李伟
    正当中国人民怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，隆重纪念中国人民优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军出国抗美援朝十周年的时候，英雄的朝鲜人民的文化使者——朝鲜人民军协奏团，在张瑞焕少将率领下，应邀来我国访问演出，这不但为我国人民的文化生活增添了异彩；同时，对进一步巩固和发展中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，为进一步发展中朝两国人民具有最悠久历史传统的文化艺术的交流，都将起到重大的作用。
    十年前，美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的反对，悍然发动了侵朝战争，并把战火燃烧到鸭绿江边。英雄的朝鲜人民，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，英勇地抗击了美国侵略者。中国人民为了“抗美援朝、保家卫国”派出了中国人民优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民并肩作战，最后，朝中人民终于战胜了貌似强大的美国侵略者，彻底戳穿了纸老虎的真面目。在这一正义的战争中，英雄的朝鲜人民为反对侵略、捍卫世界和平，作出了巨大的贡献，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的一致赞扬和尊敬。
    中朝两国人民的友谊，是两大民族唇齿相依的友谊，是两国优秀儿女为维护人民的解放事业和社会主义的胜利果实而共同斗争的友谊，是鲜血凝成的友谊。在中朝两国人民共同抗击美国侵略者的年代里，朝鲜人民对待中国人民志愿军的每一个指战员，都像对待自己亲生子女和兄弟姊妹一样，给予了巨大的支持和无微不至的关怀，有的甚至献出了他们最宝贵的生命。朝鲜人民对中国人民这种深情厚谊，中国人民将永志不忘。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团是一支由朝鲜人民军战士中选拔出来的、有艺术天才和优良品质的青年组成的艺术队伍。他们从1948年2月8日建团那一天起，就成为党在部队中进行政治工作的有力助手。在保卫祖国、抗击美国侵略者的战争时期，他们始终和朝鲜人民军战士们一起，英勇地战斗在前线。他们不仅用雄壮的歌声和欢乐的舞蹈，鼓舞了战士们的战斗情绪，必要时，他们还直接作战，对敌人进行英勇斗争。在和平建设时期，他们除了经常深入到连队教战士们唱歌跳舞，为战士们演出以外，还经常到工厂、农村，为工人、农民进行慰问演出。因此，朝鲜人民军协奏团受到了朝鲜人民军战士和朝鲜人民的热爱。
