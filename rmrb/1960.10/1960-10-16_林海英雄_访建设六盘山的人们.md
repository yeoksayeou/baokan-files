Heroes of the Forest
——Visiting the People Building the Liupan Mountains
Liupan Mountain Forestry Bureau　Our Correspondent　Ma Yuping
The towering Liupan Mountains, with their rapidly growing dense forests, resemble a green ocean. The forestry personnel building the Liupan Mountains are writing a song of praise here:

	The peaks of Liupan Mountain soar into the clouds,
	Dense trees and forests grow into a green shade;
	Mountain springs flow endlessly,
	Timber and medicinal materials are inexhaustible;
	Apples, peaches, plums, and wild fruits abound,
	Blue oaks and Chinese pines cover the forests.

This song of praise embodies the common aspirations of the Hui and Han people in the Liupan Mountains area and the forestry personnel.

	The Vanguard of Forest Area Construction
In July and August, as the rainy season in the Liupan Mountains area was approaching, a team of forestry resource surveyors arrived. Among them were southerners, northerners, and some who were undertaking forestry surveying for the first time. To further understand the details of this vast forest area and build a forestry base on the Northwest Plateau, everyone participated in this resource survey with fervent enthusiasm. The roads in the forest area were treacherous, and in many places, even narrow paths were hard to find. However, to complete the forest survey tasks as quickly as possible, everyone got up early and worked until dark, insisting on walking sixty or seventy *li* on the mountains every day. When it was dark, everyone returned to the camp with calls and responses. They did not bring cooks when they entered the forest area. During the day, they carried instruments to climb mountains and ridges to conduct measurements. In the evening, they cooked their own meals. They could not get vegetables in the deep mountains, so they made noodles and pancakes and picked wild vegetables to improve their lives. The climate in the forest area changed greatly, and the weather was sunny and rainy, which also brought difficulties to the work, but these difficulties were overcome. Once, the Third Exploration and Survey Team went to the remote Daxue Mountain forest area for investigation. It suddenly rained heavily on the way. The mountain slopes were steep, and the roads were muddy. Everyone was soaked, but they still insisted on marching. When they climbed the 2,700-meter Daxue Mountain, thick fog had enveloped the summit, and people could not see each other beyond a few meters, and they could not tell the direction. In order not to delay the journey, they held a temporary meeting on the mountain. One person held a compass and guided everyone in the "sea of clouds" according to the designated direction until dark, when they found a dilapidated thatched hut in a gully, where the entire team spent the night.

When they first entered the forest area for surveying, the work efficiency was not high, so everyone held a meeting to study and formulate new plans. Some people said: The surveyors rely on "No. 11 cars" (referring to two legs), we just need to run our legs faster. In this way, everyone seized sunny days and strived for rainy days. They did not return to the camp until the survey task was completed, which greatly accelerated the survey speed. In just over two months, they surveyed two million *mu* of forest land in the forest area.

Twenty-five-year-old young surveyor Chen Nanyang is from Fujian. He graduated from Beijing Forestry College last year and was assigned to work in Ningxia. From last year to this year, he has been to the Liupan Mountain forest area twice for reconnaissance and investigation. Although the life in the forest area is relatively hard and the climate is not very suitable, he thought of the promise he made to the Party when he graduated: "Go to the most needed and arduous places in the motherland." Seeing the scarcity of forests, drought, and severe soil erosion in the Northwest region, he felt even more energized. He led a survey team to complete the forest survey task of 300,000 *mu*.

	The Old Steward in the Forest Area
There are many model forest rangers in the forest area. Year after year, they are not afraid of severe cold or wind and rain, guarding the forest area. Fifty-eight-year-old Hui elder Ma Huajiang is one of them.

This old man lives in the Xixia Production Team of Jingbei Commune, Guanshan, Jingyuan County, Liupan Forest Area. He has lived in the forest area for his whole life, but before liberation, he watched the forest being destroyed with heartache, but he was powerless. After liberation, he became the master of the forest area and has been serving as a forest ranger. He often climbs mountains and ridges, running dozens of *li* to check the forest fire prevention situation, and actively publicizes the policies and significance of forest fire prevention to everyone. People in the surrounding mountains and forests affectionately call him the "old steward of forest protection."

Old Man Ma has always been meticulous in closing hills for afforestation and forest fire prevention. Whenever he discovers phenomena of indiscriminate logging, he sternly stops them. Some backward-thinking people satirically said, "You old man are nosy. Can you protect the forest for a lifetime?!" After hearing this, the old man patiently explained, "The forest is the wealth of the country. Protecting the forest is supporting national construction. How can that be nosy?" One winter, in a dark night, a fire broke out in the mountains more than ten *li* away. After he discovered it, he immediately woke up his two sons and ran up the mountain to put out the fire in one breath. When they arrived at the mountain, they devoted themselves to the raging fire, and their clothes and socks were burned, but they still insisted on putting out the fire. Under the leadership of his family, more than seventy people in the entire village went up the mountain and quickly put out the forest fire.

In the past few years, Old Man Ma has been repeatedly selected as a model forest ranger and has been rewarded by the Party and the government. Now, the forest area under his management has grown densely. People praised and said: "In the old society, the forests were all cut down; in the new society, the forests are full of mountains; the Guanshan Mountains were full of fire in the past; today, the Guanshan Mountains have become treasure mountains."

	Apple Trees on the Liupan Mountains
In the Liupan Mountain forest area, people admire the newly grafted apple, peach, plum, and other fruit trees here. This is the result of the Liupan Mountain Forestry Bureau's employees displaying the communist style of daring to think and act, and cultivating diligently. Now, on the slopes more than 2,000 meters above sea level, many apple orchards and pear orchards have appeared.

Grafting apple trees on the Liupan Mountains was something that people dared not even think about in the past. In the spring of 1959, when planning the construction of the Liupan Mountain forest area, the forestry personnel were determined to change the situation of "the masses in the Liupan Mountains not being able to eat fruits." They introduced a large number of apple and pear scions from Northeast China and Shaanxi, and used the excellent wild fruit trees that grow all over the Liupan Mountains to graft apple and pear trees. When they started grafting, some people did not believe that apple trees could be cultivated here at all. They said, "The Liupan Mountains are high and cold mountains. It is a delusion to want to grow apple trees." However, everyone analyzed the many favorable conditions here for grafting apples, selected sunny slopes and places with good soil, and boldly carried out grafting. Without the experience and technology of grafting apples, everyone shared their knowledge with each other and adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign grafting, high grafting and low grafting. In the first year, they grafted more than 4,900 apple trees on the Erlonghe slope, more than 2,000 meters above sea level. In May, although they suffered many attacks from wind, snow, and insect pests, the workers adopted various methods to overcome the wind, snow, and insect pests. The survival rate of grafted fruit trees finally reached more than 90%. In autumn and winter, the workers carried out soil loosening, weeding, and pruning in the garden, patiently carrying out winter management work. Now, some of these fruit trees have grown to about 1.5 meters. This year, they further summarized the experience of grafting apples and other fruit trees, and grafted more than 54,000 apple and other fruit trees in the Liupan Mountain forest area.

	Logging and Road Building in the Snowy Mountains and Forests
Daxue Mountain is a relatively primitive forest area in the Liupan Mountain forest area. There, ancient trees reach the sky, and there are various trees such as blue oak, Chinese pine, linden, and birch. Last winter, a logging team, in order to nurture young forests, plan to cut and thin some old trees, and support national construction, ventured into this forest area for the first time in the face of severe cold and snow. As soon as people arrived at Daxue Mountain, they encountered a heavy snowstorm. However, in order to extract wealth from the deep mountains, the workers fought in the snowy mountains and forests, braving the biting cold wind and stepping on snow layers that submerged their knees. Some people fell, but they got up again, slipped down and climbed up again; their hands and feet were frostbitten, but they still insisted on working. Some days the heavy snow sealed the mountain roads, and food could not be transported up. People carried the food from the bottom of the mountain to the top. The higher the mountains, the narrower and more dangerous the roads, the more severe the snowstorms, and the more difficult the logging work became. However, the heroic loggers put forward the slogan of "Work until the end even if the snow is five *chi* deep, and don't stop until the ground is frozen one *zhang* deep," and launched a red flag competition in the deep mountains. They also used the conditions of steep mountains and thick snow to slide the timber from the mountains to the bottom, which accelerated the harvesting speed. Tian Chunlin, a young worker from Shanghai who participated in the Liupan Mountain forestry construction, fell ill after going up the mountain. The old workers asked him to rest, but he not only did not rest, but insisted on saying, "Coming to this big forest in the Northwest is a good opportunity to exercise me. It would be too cowardly to rest with a little illness." Wang Keqin, a fifty-one-year-old worker, was old but full of energy, and ran faster on the mountain than the young workers. He led a logging team and was ahead in production, safety, forest cultivation, and forest protection, and was rated as an advanced team in production, safety, and forest protection.

After the logging work came to an end, people began to build the first road leading to the forest area. The route passed through high mountains and ridges more than 2,000 meters above sea level, winding and twisting. In order to build this road as soon as possible and speed up the development and construction of the forest area, people braved wind and rain, climbed cliffs, cut through thorns, split mountains and filled ditches, and completed the subgrade project of the highway across the peaks of the Liupan Mountains in a few months.

    林海英雄
    ——访建设六盘山的人们
    六盘山林业局　本报记者　马玉平
    巍峨的六盘山上，正在迅速成长起来的茂密的森林，好像一片绿色的海洋。建设六盘山的林业人员，在这里写下了一曲赞歌：
    六盘山峰耸入云，
    密树丛林绿成荫；
    山泉滚滚流不尽，
    木材药材用无穷；
    苹果桃李带野果，
    青岗华松遍成林。
    这首赞歌，体现了六盘山区回汉族人民和林业人员的共同心愿。
      建设林区的尖兵
    7、8月间，六盘山区的雨季快要到来，一支林业资源调查人员来到了六盘山区。他们当中有南方人，有北方人，有的人是初次才作林业勘测调查工作。他们为了进一步摸清这茫茫林区的底细，为在西北高原建成一个林业基地，每个人都以灼热的心情参加了这次资源调查工作。林区内道路艰险，很多地方连羊肠小道都难找到，但是，大家为了提早完成森林调查任务，每天起早摸黑，都要坚持在山上跑六、七十里路程。天黑了，大家才前呼后应回到宿营地。他们进入林区没有带炊事员，白天自己扛着仪器翻山越岭进行测量，到了晚上，又亲自动手做饭。深山中吃不到蔬菜，他们就做上面条、烙饼，采摘野菜改善生活。林区内气候变化很大，天气乍晴乍雨，也给工作带来了困难，但是，这种困难都被他们克服了。有一次，第三勘查调查组到最远的大雪山林区进行调查，中途忽然下起了大雨，山上坡度陡峭，道路泥泞，大家浑身都淋湿了，可是仍然坚持行军。等到爬上二千七百米的大雪山，大雾已弥漫山巅，几米以内看不清人影，方向也辨别不清楚。大家为了不耽误路程，就临时在山上开了个会，由一个人手执罗盘针，按照指定的方向引导大家在“云海”中摸索前进，直到天黑，才在山沟中找到了一个破茅屋，全组人员就在这里露宿了一夜。
    初进林区勘测调查时，工作效率不高，大家就开会研究，制订新的方案。有的人说：勘测人员就凭“十一号汽车”（指两条腿），我们把腿子跑快些就行了。就这样，大家抢晴天，夺雨天，完不成调查任务不回宿营地，使勘测调查速度大大加快，两个多月的时间，就勘测调查完林区二百万亩的林地面积。
    二十五岁的青年勘测员陈南阳，是福建人。去年才从北京林业学院毕业，分配到宁夏工作。从去年到今年，他曾两次到六盘山林区进行踏勘和调查。林区的生活虽然比较苦，气候也不大习惯，但是，他想到自己毕业时曾向党表示的“到祖国最需要、最艰苦的地方去”的诺言，看到西北地区林木稀少、干旱、水土流失严重的情况，浑身的劲就更大了。他带领一个调查组完成了三十万亩的森林调查任务。
    林区里的老管家
    在林区有很多护林模范人物，他们经年累月，不怕严寒，不避风雨，看管着林区。五十八岁的回族老大爷马化江就是其中的一个。
    这位老人，居住在六盘林区泾源县关山脚下的泾北公社西峡生产队。他在林区生活了一辈子，但在解放前，眼巴巴地看着森林受到破坏，心里虽然很痛惜，却无能为力。解放以后，他成了林区的主人，一直担任着护林员。他经常翻山越岭，跑到几十里路以外检查护林防火的情况，并且，积极向大家宣传护林防火的政策和意义，远近山林的人们，都亲切地称他为“护林老管家”。
    马老汉对封山育林和护林防火工作从来一丝不苟，凡是发现对森林滥砍滥伐的现象，就严肃地加以制止。有个别思想落后的人讽刺地说：“你这个老汉多管闲事，护林还能护一辈子！？”老汉听了耐心地解释说：“森林是国家的财富，护好林就是支援国家建设，那能是多管闲事。”有一年冬天，在一个漆黑的夜里，对面十多里山上发生了火灾，他发现以后，立即叫醒他的两个儿子，一口气跑上山去灭火。到了山上，他们奋不顾身地投入熊熊烈火中，自己的衣服、鞋袜都被火烧着了，还仍然坚持灭火。在他一家人的带动下，全村七十多个人都上了山，很快地扑灭了林区火灾。
    几年来，马老汉曾多次被评选为护林模范。受到党和政府的奖励。现在，他所管理的林区，林木密茂地成长起来。人们赞美地说：“旧社会林木尽砍完，新社会林木长满山，昔日关山火连天，今日关山变宝山。”
    苹果树上了六盘山
    在六盘山林区，人们都很欣赏这里新嫁接的苹果、桃、李等各种果树。这就是六盘山林业局的职工发挥敢想敢干的共产主义风格，辛勤栽培起来的。现在，在拔海两千多米的山坡上，已经出现了好多处苹果园和梨园。
    在六盘山上嫁接苹果树，过去是连想也不敢想的事。1959年春天，林业人员在规划建设六盘山林区的时候，就决心改变“六盘山群众吃不到水果”的状况，从东北、陕西引进了大量的苹果和梨穗，利用六盘山满山遍野生长的优良果树，嫁接苹果和梨等各种果树。开始嫁接的时候，有的人根本不相信这里能培植活苹果树，他们说，“六盘山是高寒山区，要想栽活苹果树是妄想”。但是，大家分析了这里可以嫁接苹果的许多有利条件，选择了阳光充足的山坡和土层好的地方，大胆进行嫁接，没有嫁接苹果的经验和技术，大家就互相传授，并采取土洋嫁接、高接与低接并举的办法，第一年就在拔海两千多米的二龙河山坡上，嫁接了四千九百多株苹果树。5月间，虽多次遭受风雪和虫害的袭击，工人们就采用各种办法，战胜了风雪和虫害。使嫁接的果树成活率终于达到了90％以上。到了秋冬，工人们又在园内进行松土、锄草和修枝，耐心地进行过冬管理工作。现在，这些果树有的已长到一米半左右。今年，他们进一步总结了嫁接苹果等果树的经验，在六盘山林区又嫁接了苹果等各种果树五万四千多株。
    雪山林海伐木修路
    大雪山是六盘山林区中比较原始的一个林区。那里古木参天，青岗、华山松、椴、桦等树木样样都有。去年冬天，一支伐木工人，为了抚育幼林、有计划地采伐、间伐一些古老的树木，支援国家建设，就冒着严寒和风雪，第一次进军到这个林区。人们刚到大雪山，就碰上了一场大风雪。但是，工人们为了向深山索取财富，就顶着刺骨的寒风，踏着深淹膝盖的雪层，在雪山林海中搏斗。有的人摔倒了，又爬起来，溜下去又爬上来；手脚冻伤了，仍然坚持工作。有些天大雪漫封了山路，吃粮驮运不上来，人们就从山下把粮食背到山顶。越到高山，道路越来越窄和艰险，风雪袭击得越厉害，进行伐木工作也越来越困难，但是，英雄的伐木工人提出了“雪下五尺干到底，地冻一丈不收兵”的口号，在深山中展开红旗竞赛，并且利用山陡雪厚的条件，用滑道把木材从山上滑到山下，反而加快了采伐的速度。来自上海参加六盘山林业建设的青年工人田春林，上山以后生了病，老工人让他休息，他不但不休息，还坚持地说：“来西北这个大森林，正是锻炼我的好机会，有点病就休息，那就太懦弱了。”五十一岁的老工人王克勤，年纪虽大，但干劲十足，在山上比青年工人还跑的快。他带领一个伐木组，在生产、安全、育林、护林等工作上样样领先，被大家评为生产、安全、护林的先进组。
    在伐木工作告一段落以后，人们又开始兴修通往林区的第一条公路。公路线通过拔海两千多米的高山峻岭，曲折蜿蜒。人们为了早日修通这条路，加快开发和建设林区，顶风雨，攀悬崖，斩荆棘，劈山填沟，在几个月的时间内，就完成跨越六盘山高峰的公路路基工程。（附图片）
