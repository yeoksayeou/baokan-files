    Relying on the Masses to Build Forestry Bases
    Gao Weixiu, Secretary of the CPC Guyuan Prefectural Committee Secretariat
    Liupan Mountain, located in the Guyuan Special District of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is one of the beautiful landscapes of our motherland. In the eleven years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Hui and Han people along the Liupan Mountain area, through universal mountain protection, forestry protection, vigorous afforestation and mountain closure for afforestation, forest tending and other work, have rapidly restored and developed this natural secondary forest area. Now, Liupan Mountain has become a "treasure mountain." Its rich resources will be increasingly used for national construction and agricultural production, and the Liupan Mountain forest area will be built into a timber base for the Ningxia region more quickly.
    Guyuan Special District is located in the loess hilly and gully area of Northwest China, with most areas having bare mountains and ridges, and extremely serious soil erosion disasters. Only the Liupan Mountain area was originally a forested area with greater vegetation cover. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the forests here also suffered from indiscriminate felling and flood damage. By the early days of liberation, only some natural secondary forests remained, and many mountains that were originally densely forested became bare mountains with no or sparse forests, and soil erosion and drought disasters became increasingly serious. Taking the Haodian Production Brigade of Shizi People's Commune in Guyuan County as an example, in the decades before liberation, tens of thousands of mu of forest area here were all felled and burned by the Kuomintang bandits, and the lives of local farmers became increasingly impoverished. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization, the Hui and Han people of the entire special district, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, established the ambitious goal of greening Liupan Mountain. In the past few years, the area of mountain closure for afforestation has reached more than 570,000 mu, and forest tending has covered more than 14,000 mu. At the same time, large areas of water and soil conservation forests, timber forests, and economic forests have been created on suitable barren mountains and gullies, so that the Liupan Mountain, a remnant forest area, has regained its youth, and forest coverage has begun to recover, with lush vegetation, and some forests have already become timber. As the farmers describe it: "The mountains are green and shady, the streams between the mountains are clear, the fruit trees at the foot of the mountains are fragrant, and birds sing everywhere in the forests."
    With the rapid restoration of the Liupan Mountain forest area, agricultural and animal husbandry production here has greatly developed, and the lives of the Hui and Han people have greatly improved. In particular, the diversified economy in the mountainous areas has flourished. Counties and communes along the Liupan Mountain area, as well as state-owned forest farms and other units, have opened wineries, starch factories, fiber factories, tannin extract factories, mountain product weaving factories, and agricultural implement manufacturing factories, making full use of the rich resources of Liupan Mountain to serve agricultural production and benefit the people's lives. The income from forestry and sideline occupations of some production teams has reached about 40% of their agricultural income. The fourteen mountain product and agricultural implement weaving and manufacturing factories established in Jingyuan County have produced more than 690,000 pieces of various mountain products and agricultural implements in the past few years, which not only supplied the needs of agricultural production in the county, but also provided a large amount of support to other regions.
    The above facts, while showing that we have achieved certain successes in protecting and building the Liupan Mountain forest area and developing and utilizing the resources of Liupan Mountain, with the rapid development of the national economy and the rapid progress of various undertakings, the demand for timber and forest by-products by the state and the people is increasing day by day. In particular, the Ningxia region is a region with a great shortage of timber. Therefore, accelerating the greening and construction of the Liupan Mountain forest area and building this natural secondary forest into a timber-based forestry base is of great political and economic significance. Liupan Mountain was historically a forested area and has many favorable conditions for developing forestry: First, the rainfall is abundant, with an annual rainfall of about 500 to 900 millimeters, and the soil is fertile and rich in organic matter, which is suitable for the growth of trees. Second, there are many tree species. Among the trees and shrubs that have now been restored, there are more than a dozen species of high-quality timber and fast-growing forest trees such as mountain poplar, birch, red birch, linden, oak, and Pinus armandii. They can be selected, cultivated, planted and developed in large quantities. Third, Liupan Mountain also has a large area of forest land and suitable barren mountains, which can be used to create large-scale, fast-growing and high-yielding timber forests. Fourth, there are more than 100,000 Hui and Han people living along the Liupan Mountain area, and they all have certain experience and habits in managing forestry. After the people's communization, the masses in the forest area have been highly organized, which is convenient for the planned construction and development of forestry. Fifth, the transportation is convenient. At present, highways such as Xi'an-Lanzhou, Guyuan-Jingyuan, Guyuan-Longde, Jingyuan-Hualong, and Jingyuan-Longde run through it, providing relatively favorable conditions for creating and building forestry. Liupan Mountain is basically a natural secondary forest area. As long as we strengthen tending and transformation, and expand forestry construction on the basis of the secondary forest, we can achieve the goals of less investment, greater returns, easy growth, and fast speed. Therefore, transforming this natural secondary forest is not only an important way to build forestry, but also in line with the spirit of developing forestry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
    In order to build Liupan Mountain into a timber-based forestry base as soon as possible, our approach is: (1) We must constantly struggle against conservative ideas and resolutely implement the series of guiding principles and policies put forward by the Central Committee for forestry, such as "base development, forest farm development, high-yield development," afforestation and forest protection going hand in hand, afforestation by communes and state-owned afforestation going hand in hand, and state-owned forest farms focusing on forestry and comprehensive management. At present, we have established a Forestry Bureau in the Liupan Mountain area, and have established thirteen state-owned forest farms. The sixteen people's communes along the Liupan Mountain area have also established small-scale commune-run forest farms, and production teams have established nurseries. At the same time, according to the distribution of forests and forest land, we have adopted the principle of "counties contracting counties, communes contracting communes, teams contracting teams for afforestation and forest protection, and simultaneous development of seedling cultivation, transformation, utilization, and creation," to accelerate the transformation of forestless land into forested land; sparse forest land into dense forest land; and shrub forest into arbor forest. In the afforestation steps, first gullies and river banks, then mountain slopes, create one piece and consolidate one piece. Select and cultivate local high-quality tree species and fast-growing and high-yielding tree species as the main ones, combined with the introduction of foreign varieties, to achieve both improved quality and fast growth. In the utilization of timber, we also implement the necessary thinning in tending and renewal, as well as the thinning and utilization of dead and old trees under the principle of combining long-term interests and current interests, strictly prohibit indiscriminate felling, and resolutely achieve "two felling and two not felling," that is, felling dense and not sparse, felling old, rotten, bent, and inferior trees and shrubs in dense forests, and not felling healthy, straight, and sparse trees and shrubs. (2) The development of forestry must be carried out on the basis of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production. All state-owned forest farms in the forest area must carry out the "four plantings" of grain, oil, feed, and vegetables and the "thirteen raising movement" of raising livestock and poultry under the principle of focusing on forestry and comprehensive management, and strive for self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and meat. People's communes near the forest area must also focus on grain production and develop forestry so that forestry can better serve agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry. At present, the 22 state-owned forest farms in the entire special district, based on this principle, have cultivated 828 mu of grain, 25 mu of oil crops, and 162 mu of vegetables by reclaiming wasteland and using forest land, and raised more than 70 large livestock, and more than 350 sheep, pigs, rabbits, and chickens. The Huangjiazhuang Forest Farm has developed 60 hives of bees this year. (3) We must vigorously launch mass movements. The high-speed development of our various undertakings is inseparable from the millions of working people, and the same is true for forestry construction. Therefore, forest protection and afforestation must be carried out through mass movements. Only when the masses universally protect and afforest the forests can the trees grow rapidly. Since this year, the youth in various counties have proposed to create "Long March Forests" along the roads traveled by the Red Army during the Long March, and more than 80,000 people have participated in afforestation activities, afforesting several hundred li in one month. Now, all people's communes near the forest area have established forest protection and afforestation organizations, with more than 1,000 forest rangers, and many forest protection models and units have emerged. This is an important force and foundation for our vigorous forest protection, afforestation and other forestry construction. At the same time, we must summarize the experience of the masses and promote the wisdom of the masses. In 1960, we summarized the experience of river siltation afforestation in Longde and other places, and then launched a "riverbed landscaping" and "every commune has a forest farm, every team builds an orchard" movement. In one spring, more than 200,000 mu of trees were planted along the riverbed of Liupan Mountain. (4) We must transform and utilize forest resources on the basis of comprehensive planning. Recently, we have organized manpower to conduct a comprehensive resource survey of the Liupan Mountain forest area. The Liupan Mountain natural secondary forest area has deep mountain areas, shallow mountain areas, sparse forest areas; there are arbor forests, shrub forests, arbor-shrub mixed forests, wool forests, bamboo forests, and large areas of suitable barren land. Therefore, we must adopt different measures according to different situations and carry out transformation and utilization in accordance with local conditions. The specific methods are: in the forest area south of the main peak of Liupan Mountain, focus on tending, transforming, and utilizing, supplemented by creation; in the suitable barren land north of the main peak of Liupan Mountain, focus on large-scale afforestation, while carrying out tending. There are a large number of high-quality fruit trees and economic trees such as walnuts, Chinese prickly ash, and hazelnuts in Liupan Mountain. While developing timber forests, we can vigorously develop economic forests and fruit tree forests. There are more than 100 kinds of well-known medicinal materials in Liupan Mountain, tens of thousands of mu of bamboo, and various wild plants and their fruits, which can be used as raw materials for chemical industry, fiber, tannin extract, starch, etc. The full utilization of these resources must be combined with tending, transformation, and management, and carried out in a planned manner. The processing of forest by-products must also be carried out mainly by simple and small-scale methods and by combining indigenous and foreign methods. This will not only ensure the management of natural secondary forests, develop the mountain economy, but also fully serve the national construction and people's lives with wild plants and forest by-products.
    Now, the work of building Liupan Mountain into a timber-based forestry base has begun in an all-round way. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, relying on the enthusiasm and wisdom of the people in the mountainous areas and forestry workers, we will surely realize this beautiful wish in a short period of time.

    依靠群众建设林业基地
    中共固原地委书记处书记  高维秀
    六盘山位于宁夏回族自治区的固原专区，是我们祖国美丽锦绣山河之一。解放十一年来，在党的领导下，沿六盘山一带的回汉族人民，经过普遍护山、护林、大力造林和封山育林，成林抚育等工作，使这个天然次生林区得到了迅速恢复和发展。现在，六盘山已成为一座“万宝山”。它的丰富的资源，将越来越多地被用于国家建设和农业生产，六盘山林区也将更快地被建设成为宁夏地区的一个用材林基地。
    固原专区地处西北黄土高原丘陵沟壑区，大部分地区光山秃岭，水土流失灾害异常严重。唯有六盘山一带原是森林地区，被复较大。但是，在国民党反动统治时期，这里的林木也遭受滥伐和水灾的破坏，到解放初期，仅残存一些天然次生林，很多原来森林茂密的山岭，成了无林或疏林的秃山，水土流失和干旱的灾害越来越严重。以固原县什字人民公社蒿店生产大队为例，解放前几十年间，这里几万亩的森林面积，全被国民党匪帮砍伐、烧毁殆尽，当地农民的生活越来越贫苦。解放以后，特别自大跃进和人民公社化以来，全专区回汉族人民高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，树立了绿化六盘山的雄心壮志，几年来封山育林面积达到五十七万多亩，成林抚育一万四千多亩，同时，还在宜林的荒山、荒沟，营造了大片水土保持林、用材林和经济林，使六盘山这个残林迹地又恢复了青春，森林复盖开始复原，草木丛生，有些林木已经成材。正如农民所形容的：“山上翠绿成荫，山间水流清清，山下果树芬香，森林处处鸟鸣。”
    随着六盘山林区的迅速恢复，这里的农牧业生产有了很大的发展，回汉族人民的生活也都有了很大的提高。特别是山区的多种经营百花齐开，沿六盘山一带的县和公社以及国营林场等单位，开办了制酒、淀粉、纤维、栲胶、山货编织和农具制造厂，充分利用六盘山的丰富资源，为农业生产服务和为人民生活造福。有的生产队林副业收入就达到农业收入的40％左右。泾源县建立的十四个山货农具编织制造厂，几年来，共生产各种山货、农具六十九万余件，不仅供应了本县农业生产的需用，还大量支援了外区。
    上述事实，虽然说明我们在保护、建设六盘山林区，以及开发利用六盘山资源方面取得了一定的成绩，但是，随着国民经济的飞跃发展，各项事业突飞猛进，国家、人民对木材、林副产品的需用量日益增加。特别是宁夏地区是个木材十分缺乏的地区，因此，加速绿化和建设六盘山林区，把这个天然次生林建成一个以用材林为主的林业基地，就具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。六盘山在历史上是一个森林区，具有发展林业的很多优越条件：第一，雨量充沛，这里年雨量在五百毫米到九百毫米左右，土质肥沃，富有机质，适宜于林木生长。第二，树种多，现在已恢复起来的乔、灌木林中，就有山杨、白桦、红桦、椴、青岗、华山松十多种优良用材林和速生林树种。可以大量的选育、种植和发展。第三，六盘山还有大面积的森林迹地和宜林荒山，可以大量营造速生丰产的用材林。第四，沿六盘山一带，居住着十万多回汉族人民，他们都有一定的经营林业的经验和习惯，在人民公社化以后，林区群众已经高度组织起来，便于有计划地建设和发展林业。第五，交通方便，目前有西兰、固泾、固隆、泾华、泾隆等公路贯穿其间，给营造、建设林业提供了比较优越的条件。六盘山基本上是一个天然次生林区，只要加强抚育、改造，在次生林的基础上扩大林业建设，就可以达到投资少、收效大、易成长、速度快的目的。因此，改造这个天然次生林，不但是建设林业的一个重要途径，也符合多快好省发展林业的精神。
    为了尽快地把六盘山建设成为一个以用材林为主的林业基地，我们的做法是：（一）必须和保守思想作经常不断的斗争，坚决贯彻执行中央提出的林业“基地化、林场化、丰产化”以及造林和护林并举，公社造林和国营造林并举，国营林场要以林为主，综合经营等一系列的方针政策。目前，我们在六盘山区已经设立了林业局，并建立了十三个国营林场，沿六盘山一带的十六个人民公社，也都建立了小型的社办林场，生产队都设立了苗圃。同时，根据林木和林地分布情况，采取了“县包县、社包社、队包队的造林、护林方法和育苗、改造、利用、营造”同时并举的原则，加速使无林地变为有林地；疏林地变为密林地；灌木林变为乔木林。在造林步骤上，先沟壑、河岸，后山坡，造一片成一片，成一片巩固一片。并选育当地优良树种和速生丰产树种为主，结合引进外地品种，既达到提高质量，又能速生速长。在木材利用上，也在长远利益和目前利益相结合的原则下，贯彻抚育更新中的必要间伐及枯老树木的间伐利用，严禁乱砍乱伐，坚决作到“两砍两不砍”，即砍稠不砍稀，砍稠密林中的老树、腐朽的弯次乔灌木，不砍健壮端直稀少的乔灌木。（二）发展林业必须在大办农业、大办粮食的基础上进行。林区内各国营林场必须在以林为主，综合经营的方针下，开展粮食、油料、饲料、蔬菜“四种”和饲养家畜家禽的“十三养运动”，力争粮食、蔬菜、肉食自给。靠近林区的各人民公社，也必须以粮食生产为主，发展林业，使林业更好地为农业、畜牧业、工业服务。目前，全专区已办起的二十二个国营林场，本此方针，开荒和利用林间空地种植了粮食八百二十八亩，油料二十五亩，蔬菜一百六十二亩，饲养大家畜七十多头，羊、猪、兔、鸡三百五十多只，黄家庄一个林场，今年养蜂就发展到六十窝。（三）必须大搞群众运动。我们各项事业的高速度发展，都离不开千百万劳动群众，林业建设事业也是一样。因此，护林、造林都必须大搞群众运动，只有群众普遍地护林、造林，林木才能迅速地生长起来。今年以来，各县青少年提出沿红军当年长征时走过的道路，营造“长征林”，投入造林活动的就有八万多人，在一个月内，就造林几百华里。现在，靠近林区的各人民公社，都建立了护林、造林组织，拥有护林员一千多名，并出现了许多护林模范人物和单位，这是我们大搞护林、造林等林业建设的重要力量和基础。同时，必须总结群众的经验，发扬群众的智慧。1960年我们总结了隆德等地河川淤地造林的经验，随即开展了一个“河床园林化”和“社社有林场，队队建果园”运动，一个春季，就沿六盘山河床一带植树二十余万亩。（四）必须在全面规划的基础上，改造和利用森林资源。最近，我们已组织人力对六盘山林区进行了一次全面的资源调查。六盘山天然次生林区，有深山区，浅山区，疏林区；有乔木林，灌木林，乔、灌木混合林，毛林，山竹林，还有大片的宜林荒山地。因此，必须根据不同的情况，采取不同的措施，因地制宜进行改造和利用。具体的办法是：在六盘山主峰以南的森林区，以抚育、改造、利用为主，营造为辅；在六盘山主峰以北宜林荒地，以大规模造林为主，同时进行抚育。六盘山内有大量的优良果树和核桃、花椒、榛子等经济树木，可以在发展用材林的同时，大力发展经济林、果树林。六盘山内有知名的药材一百多种，有毛竹数十万亩，有各种野生植物及其果实，可做化工、纤维、栲胶、淀粉等原料，对于这些资源的充分利用，必须结合抚育、改造、经营，有计划地进行，林副产品的加工也必须是以简易、小型为主和土洋结合的办法进行，这样不但可以保证天然次生林的经营工作，发展山区经济，而且使野生植物及林副产品，充分为国家建设和人民生活服务。
    现在，把六盘山建设成为一个以用材林为主的林业基地的工作，已经全面开始。我们坚信在党的领导下，依靠山区人民群众和林业职工的干劲和智慧，一定能在较短的时间内，实现这一美好的愿望。
