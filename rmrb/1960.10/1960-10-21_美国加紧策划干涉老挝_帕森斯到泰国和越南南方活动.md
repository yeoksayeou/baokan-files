Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 20th — After conspiring with the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique in Saigon on a plan to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons left Saigon for Cambodia early this morning.

Parsons arrived in Saigon on the 18th. Before this, he spent four days in Laos and then three busy days in Bangkok, deploying schemes for Thailand and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to further interfere in Laos.

It is reported that Parsons held secret talks with Ngo Dinh Diem on the day he arrived in Saigon. Participants in this secret meeting included John Irwin, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Riley, U.S. Chief of Staff of the Pacific Fleet, U.S. “Ambassador” Durbrow, and General McGarr, head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Vietnam.

While Parsons was conducting his conspiracy to interfere in Laos, the U.S. State Department announced on the 17th the resumption of military “aid” to Laos. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Vientiane on the 19th, "the United States is clearly unwilling to just pay the troops loyal to the neutral government," and the United States wants to distribute "aid to all units of the Lao army," including the forces of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. According to Agence France-Presse on the 19th, Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat, who had just met with Parsons, told reporters in Bangkok that Parsons was "genuinely worried" about the development of the situation in Laos "because the Lao constitutional government is recklessly dealing with the Communists." Sarit also pointed out that the United States wants the Phouma government and the Nosavan group to "reach an understanding in order to deal with communism."

    美国加紧策划干涉老挝
    帕森斯到泰国和越南南方活动
    据新华社20日讯　西贡消息：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯在西贡同越南南方吴庭艳集团策划了一番干涉老挝内政的密谋之后，已于今天早晨离开西贡去柬埔寨。
    帕森斯是18日到达西贡的。在这以前，他先在老挝进行了四天活动，然后又到曼谷忙碌了三天，部署泰国和东南亚侵略集团进一步干涉老挝的阴谋。
    据报道，帕森斯在到达西贡的当天，就同吴庭艳举行了密谈。参加这次密谈的有美国负责国际安全问题的国防部副部长约翰·欧文、美国驻太平洋地区海军参谋长赖利、美国“大使”杜伯劳和美国驻越南南方军事代表团团长麦克加尔。
    当帕森斯正在进行干涉老挝的阴谋活动的时候，美国国务院在17日宣布恢复对老挝的军事“援助”。据美联社19日发自万象的电讯透露，“美国显然是不愿单单向忠于中立政府的部队付钱”，美国是要把“援助分给老挝陆军所有的部队”，即包括富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的部队。据法新社19日报道，刚同帕森斯会谈过的泰国总理乃沙立在曼谷对记者说，帕森斯对于老挝局势发展“真正担心”，“因为老挝立宪政府轻率地同共产党人打交道”。乃沙立还指出，美国是想要富马政府和诺萨万集团“达成谅解以便对付共产主义”。
