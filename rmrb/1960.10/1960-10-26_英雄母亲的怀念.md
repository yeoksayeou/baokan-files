Remembering a Heroic Mother
	Zhongjiang Daily reporter, Xinhua News Agency reporter

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we visited the home of Deng Fangzhi, the mother of the former Volunteer Army Special Class Hero Huang Jiguang. This heroic mother, who sacrificed her son to defend world peace and the freedom and happiness of the Korean people, held our hands and repeatedly urged us to send a letter on her behalf to her relatives thousands of miles away—the heroic Korean people she will always remember.

Only those who have contributed their efforts to the cause of peace and friendship truly understand the value of peace and friendship.

These days, how many unforgettable memories have flooded Huang’s mother’s heart. The photograph hanging on the wall was taken this August when she met with the distinguished guests of the Korean-Chinese Friendship Association delegation—the envoys of the Korean people. The pair of white vases are gifts from the Korean people. She cherished them and took them out of the box to celebrate the festival, inserting bright chrysanthemums. And those precious commemorative badges, silver bowls, silver spoons, Korean handicrafts, and clothes—they all contain the profound affection of the Korean people! A few days ago, Huang's mother specially wore the Korean national costume presented by Kim Jong-heng, the head of the Korean-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, and took photos with her grandchildren. Huang's mother said meaningfully: "I want my children and grandchildren to always remember our relatives in Korea!"

On winter evenings and during summer field breaks, Huang's mother has told the commune members countless stories about the friendship of the Korean people. She vividly remembers the days she spent with Chairman Kim Jong-heng this August. At that time, they ate at the same table every day and often sat together to talk. Chairman Kim Jong-heng inquired with concern about Huang’s mother’s family and living situation. Huang's mother enthusiastically introduced the construction of her hometown to Chairman Kim Jong-heng, who urged Huang's mother to eat more at almost every meal. He said: Huang’s mother, your good health gives us more energy to work! It was also at this time that Huang’s mother asked Chairman Kim Jong-heng to send a red brocade quilt cover and a set of white silk clothing to Gu Fuli, a heroic Korean mother.

Gu Fuli is already an old friend of Huang's mother. In April 1954, when the Korean People's Delegation to China visited Huang's mother in Chengdu, the two heroic mothers met. They hugged each other tightly, shedding tears of excitement and friendship. Huang's mother once expressed her longing to the comrades of the delegation. She said: "I often think of seeing the heroic Korean people and the heroic soldiers of the brave Korean People's Army at home." This year, when she saw the envoys of the Korean people again, Huang's mother missed Gu Fuli, the Korean mother who had sacrificed her husband for peace, even more. She asked Chairman Kim Jong-heng to send her regards to Gu Fuli, hoping that her old friend would come to China again.

It is precisely in this way that, although separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the friendship forged with common blood closely connects this remote Chinese farm village with the Korean people. For seven or eight years, letters filled with warm affection and precious gifts have been sent here from Korea. Korean children sent their carefully made handicrafts, Korean elders sent silver bowls full of blessings, and soldiers of the Korean People's Army also sent precious seeds of crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton one after another. A soldier of the People's Army said in a letter sending rice seeds: "This is a seed of Korean friendship. I hope it will take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit on the land of great China."

These seeds, soaked in the friendship between China and Korea, have grown and flourished in the hero's hometown. The heroic mother and the people of the hero's hometown have put in so much meticulous and arduous labor in cultivating these seeds of friendship! They have opened up high-yield fields for Korean friendship seeds and carefully discussed and formulated measures to increase production. Regardless of severe winter or hot summer, they intensified management and protection day and night, increasing these seeds from a small package to dozens of catties, or even hundreds of catties, continuously achieving bumper harvests. Last winter and this spring, Huang's mother and the members of the Jiguang Management District Jiguang Production Team, where she is located, planted one mu of high-yield rapeseed fields using Korean rapeseed seeds and cultivated five rapeseed kings. Huang’s mother and the commune members applied double the fertilizer to these rapeseed plants. In order to defend against the severe cold, she and everyone built sheds for the high-yield fields with sun mats and bamboo hats, and made cold-proof covers for the rapeseed kings with oiled paper and branches. On the coldest days, they also lit fires in the fields to raise the temperature and prevent frost damage. Regardless of wind, rain, or slippery roads, Huang’s mother had to participate in the labor herself. The commune members advised her to rest more, but Huang’s mother said: These are seeds from Korea, I can't rest assured if I don't do it myself. This spring, this rapeseed field suddenly suffered from wilt disease. Huang's mother was so anxious that she couldn't sleep at night and looked for agricultural technicians to discuss ways to treat the disease. They self-made lime sulfur mixture and sprayed the field three times in a row to stop the wilt disease in time. These rapeseeds finally achieved a bumper harvest. The unit yield of one mu of high-yield field reached 520 catties. Among the five rapeseed kings, the largest one achieved a single-plant yield of one catty and twelve taels!

In recent years, Huang's mother has also traveled to many places across the country, telling the workers, farmers, students, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army about the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, encouraging everyone to build the motherland, and to fight against imperialist aggression and defend world peace together with the Korean people and the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union. In the hearts of the members of the Jiguang Commune in Zhongjiang County, the friendship between China and Korea has become a huge force inspiring everyone to build the countryside and the motherland.

When we went to visit, Huang's mother was conducting wheat variety experiments in the fields of her hometown. She said to us, our hearts and the hearts of the Korean people are connected forever.

    英雄母亲的怀念
    中江报记者  新华社记者
    在抗美援朝十周年纪念日的前夕，我们来到了前志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝的家。这位为了保卫世界和平和朝鲜人民的自由、幸福而献出自己儿子的英雄母亲，拉着我们的手，再三嘱托我们替她捎上一个信，问候远隔千山万水的亲人——她永远怀念着的英雄的朝鲜人民。
    只有在争取和平和友谊的事业中贡献过自己心血的人，最懂得和平友谊的珍贵。
    这些日子，在黄妈妈心里涌现了多少难忘的回忆。那墙上悬挂的一幅照片，是今年8月她和朝鲜人民的使者——朝中友协代表团的贵宾们会见时合拍的。那一对白色的花瓶，是朝鲜人民送来的礼物。为了纪念节日，她才从箱子里珍惜地取出来，插上了鲜艳的菊花。还有那各种珍贵的纪念章、银碗、银匙、朝鲜工艺品和衣服，它们都包含着朝鲜人民多么深厚的情谊！前些日子，黄妈妈特意穿着朝中友协代表团团长金钟恒赠送的朝鲜民族服装，与孙子、孙女一块拍了照片。黄妈妈意味深长地说：“我要让子子孙孙永远记得我们在朝鲜的亲人！”
    在冬日的傍晚，在夏天田间休息的时候，黄妈妈曾经向社员们叙述了多少关于朝鲜人民友谊的故事。她牢记着今年8月与金钟恒团长一同度过的日子。那时，他们每天同桌吃饭、常常围坐谈心。金钟恒团长关怀地询问黄妈妈的家庭情况、生活情况。黄妈妈兴高采烈地向金钟恒团长介绍家乡的建设，金钟恒团长几乎在每一餐饭都要劝黄妈妈多吃一些。他说：黄妈妈，你的身体健康，我们工作起来就更有劲了！就是这一次，黄妈妈还把一幅红色锦缎被面和一套白色纺绸衣料，请金钟恒团长代送给一位朝鲜的英雄母亲具富力。
    具富力已经是黄妈妈的老朋友了。1954年4月朝鲜人民访华代表团在成都市慰问黄妈妈时，两位英雄母亲见了面。她们紧紧地拥抱在一起，流出了激动和友谊的热泪。黄妈妈曾经向代表团的同志们表达了自己的思念。她说：“我在家里常常想见英雄的朝鲜人民，想见英勇的朝鲜人民军的英雄战士们。”今年当她再次见到朝鲜人民的使者时，黄妈妈更加想念为和平献出了丈夫的朝鲜母亲具富力。她请金钟恒团长向具富力问好，希望她的老朋友再到中国来。
    正是这样，虽然远隔着万水千山，但是，用共同的鲜血凝成的友谊，却把这个偏僻的中国农庄和朝鲜人民紧密联结在一起。七、八年来，一封封洋溢着热烈情谊的信件，一件件珍贵的礼物，从朝鲜送到这里。朝鲜孩子们送来自己精心制成的手工制品，朝鲜的老人送来满含祝愿的银碗，朝鲜人民军的战士们还先后寄来了水稻、小麦、棉花等农作物的珍贵种子。一个人民军战士在寄来水稻种子的信上说：“这是朝鲜友谊种，我希望它在伟大中国的土地上生根、发芽、开花、结籽。”
    这些浸透中朝友谊的种子，已经在英雄的故乡发育滋长。英雄母亲和英雄故乡的人民，在培育这些友谊种子时，付出了多么精细和艰巨的劳动！他们开辟了朝鲜友谊种的高产田，细致地讨论和制订增产措施。不论严冬和酷暑，日夜加紧管理、守护，使这些种子从一小包增加到几十斤，甚至几百斤，不断获得丰收。去冬今春，黄妈妈和她所在的继光管理区继光生产队的社员，用朝鲜的油菜种子，种植了一亩油菜高产田，并培育了五株油菜王。黄妈妈和社员们一起，给这些油菜施了双倍的肥料。为了防御严寒，她和大家用晒席、竹笠，给高产田搭了棚；用油纸、树枝，给油菜王作了防寒罩。在最冷的日子，他们还在田里烧火升温，防止冻害。不管风雨路滑，黄妈妈都要亲自参加劳动。社员们劝她多休息一下，黄妈妈说：这是朝鲜来的种子，不亲自动手，我放不下心。今年春天，这块油菜田突然发生了枯萎病，黄妈妈夜里急得睡不着，找着农业技术员一起商量治病害的办法。他们自制出石硫合剂；连续给这块田喷射了三次，才把枯萎病及时制止，这些油菜终于获得丰收。一亩高产田的单位产量达到五百二十斤。五株油菜王中，最大的一株获得了一斤十二两的单株产量！
    这些年来，黄妈妈还走遍了全国多少地方，向祖国的工人、农民、学生、解放军战士讲述中朝人民的友谊，鼓舞大家建设祖国，和朝鲜人民以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国一起，为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平而斗争。在中江县继光公社社员心中，中朝友谊已经成为鼓舞大家建设农村、建设祖国的巨大力量。
    当我们前去访问的时候，黄妈妈正在家乡的田间上，进行小麦品种试验。她对我们说，我们和朝鲜人民的心永世万代连在一起。
