    Fuzhou, October 21st (Reported by our newspaper) - Qibu Brigade of Qibu Commune in Zhouning County, Fujian Province, has established a fertilizer management station, closely linking the five main aspects of manure accumulation, production, management, transportation, and application. Through overall planning and comprehensive consideration, they have achieved constant manure accumulation and production, planned fertilizer use, and rational fertilizer application, significantly increasing the quantity and quality of fertilizer and reducing the cost of manure accumulation and production, effectively promoting production development. Currently, the base fertilizer for winter crops in this brigade is basically sufficient, and they are accelerating the accumulation of fertilizer for spring crops’ topdressing according to the needs of this winter and next spring.
    The Qibu Brigade Fertilizer Management Station consists of eleven members, including experienced farmers who are not detached from production, technicians, and cadres. It has a crop fertilizer planning group, a manure accumulation and production inspection group, and a fertilizer scientific management group. Each of the six production teams in the brigade is also equipped with one or two part-time fertilizer administrators. Their main task is, under the leadership of the brigade Party branch, to arrange the brigade's year-round and intensive manure accumulation and production work according to the needs of different seasons, soil, and crops; to purchase scattered fertilizer from commune members; to assist in the distribution of commercial fertilizer; and to check the implementation of fertilizer application plans of each team. As manure accumulation, production, management, transportation, and application are all studied and arranged by dedicated personnel, the manure accumulation and fertilizer use situation in the brigade has undergone tremendous changes.
    After the establishment of the Fertilizer Management Station, it systematically summarized and promoted the successful experiences created by commune members in various aspects of manure accumulation, transportation, and fertilizer application. First, based on the strong seasonality of fertilizer use for crops, they firmly grasped the key of "early," proposed the slogan "one early leads to a hundred earlies," and vigorously promoted early manure accumulation, ensuring timely fertilization. The Party branch also proposed a "winter two, early rice three, late rice four" manure accumulation and application plan. That is, before the start of the spring plowing season in February, the masses are mobilized to carry out an intensive manure accumulation campaign, preparing twenty dan of topdressing fertilizer for each mu of winter crops, thirty dan of base fertilizer for each mu of early rice, and forty dan of manure for each mu of late rice in advance. After the busy spring plowing season, the brigade seized every opportunity to carry out several intensive manure accumulation weeks of "preparing for summer in spring and storing for autumn in summer," which not only prepared a large amount of high-quality topdressing and base fertilizer for early rice and summer crops, but also prepared a large amount of topdressing fertilizer for the autumn harvest and winter planting.
    The Qibu Brigade Fertilizer Management Station also further comprehensively promoted the method of multiple and phased rational fertilization based on the experience of the masses and the results of scientific research, and created a set of "seven looks" fertilization experience, including looking at the field, seedlings, water, climate, dense planting, and varieties, as well as a fertilization system of "seven parts base fertilizer, three parts topdressing" according to local conditions. In this year's late rice planting and field management, they applied forty to fifty dan of fertilizer as base fertilizer to each mu of the eight hundred and forty-two mu of late rice fields, depending on the thickness of the soil layer and the fertility of the soil, based on the characteristics that more than 90% of the brigade's fields are poor and thin mountain fields, with shallow soil layers, early frost, and the tendency of crop roots to seek fertilizer (i.e., where there is more fertilizer in the soil, the crop roots easily extend there). In the application of topdressing fertilizer, they also rationally applied topdressing fertilizer according to the "seven looks" fertilization requirements, based on the soil and seedling growth of the brigade's late rice fields, and divided them into four categories. Due to rational fertilization, this year's late rice in the brigade, regardless of mountain fields, ocean fields, near fields, or far fields, all grew equally dark green and strong, with first-class seedlings accounting for 89.7%. In the most recent county-wide late rice inspection, Qibu Commune's late rice won the county's red flag, and Qibu Brigade was the model team of the red flag commune.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, the Fertilizer Management Station also reformed the original manure accumulation and transportation system based on the characteristics of land joining together after communization, after investigation and research, thereby increasing the amount of fertilizer accumulated and saving a large amount of labor for manure accumulation and transportation. From March to August this year, the brigade accumulated and produced a total of more than 98,000 dan of fertilizer, an increase of 82.7% over the same period last year, while the labor spent on manure accumulation and production was reduced by about three-fifths compared to last year, saving an estimated 1,500 labor days for manure accumulation, production, and transportation in half a year. This reduced the workload of manure accumulation and transportation from 51.84% of the total field operations in the past to only 11.78%. Their approach was first to vigorously reform the manure accumulation system, build a large network of field fertilizer bases, and vigorously promote the experience of on-site manure accumulation, on-site storage, and on-site application, increasing the number of field fertilizer pits, pools, and sheds in the brigade from thirteen in the past to one hundred and eighty-six, accumulating and producing more than 86,000 dan of fertilizer on-site in half a year, accounting for 87.75% of the total fertilizer accumulated and produced by the brigade. The second is to establish a system of carrying fertilizer to the fields year-round. The brigade regarded carrying fertilizer to the fields as one of the criteria for evaluating "five-good" commune members, and provided labor point subsidies to commune members who carried fertilizer to the fields according to the distance of the fields, thereby encouraging the commune members' enthusiasm for carrying fertilizer to the fields. In the past half year, more than 12,000 dan of human and animal manure and miscellaneous soil fertilizer accumulated in the village were carried to the fertilizer pits and sheds in the fields by commune members when they went to work in the fields, saving labor for transporting fertilizer to the fields, ensuring that fertilizer was available anytime and anywhere, and improving environmental hygiene. Third, the Fertilizer Management Station is responsible for regularly (three times a month) purchasing scattered fertilizer accumulated by commune members' families, greatly encouraging commune members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer in their spare time. In more than half a year, 82% of the commune members completed their original family manure accumulation and sales plan, and 17% of the commune members also received rewards for exceeding the manure accumulation quota.

    常年积肥季季肥足　合理用肥事半功倍
    七步大队改进积肥方法三至八月积肥量比去年增加82％节省劳力五分之三
    本报福州21日电　福建省周宁县七步公社七步大队建立肥料管理站，把积、造、管、运、施五个主要环节密切衔接起来，统筹兼顾，全面安排，实现了常年积肥造肥，计划用肥和合理施肥，大大增加了肥料数量，提高了肥料质量，降低了积肥造肥工本，有力地促进了生产的发展。目前，这个大队的冬种底肥已基本够用，正根据今冬明春需要赶积小春作物追肥。
    七步大队肥料管理站由不脱产的老农和技术员、干部等十一人组成，设有作物用肥计划组、积肥造肥检查组、肥料科学管理组。全大队六个生产小队还配有一个或两个不脱产的肥料管理员。他们的主要任务是在大队党支部领导下，根据不同季节、土壤和作物的需要安排全队常年和突击积肥造肥工作；收购社员的零星肥料；协助分配商品肥料；检查各小队施肥计划执行情况。由于肥料的积、造、管、运、施都有专人研究安排，全大队积肥用肥情况发生了巨大变化。
    肥料管理站成立后，就系统总结和推广了社员创造的各种积肥、运肥、用肥等成功经验。首先根据农作物用肥有强烈季节性，紧紧抓住“早”字，提出“一早百早”的口号，大抓早积肥，保证了适时施肥。并且通过党支部提出了“冬二、早三、晚稻四”的积肥施肥方案。即在2月间春耕大忙开始前，发动群众开展突击积肥运动，提前为每亩冬种作物准备追肥二十担，为每亩早稻备基肥三十担，每亩晚稻积肥四十担。春耕大忙过后，全队又见缝插针，开展了几次“春为夏备、夏为秋存”的积肥突击周，不但为早稻和夏种作物准备了大量优质追肥和基肥，还为秋收冬种准备了大量追肥。
    七步大队肥料管理站还根据群众经验和科学研究结果，进一步全面推广了多次、分期合理施肥办法，因地制宜地创造了一套看田、看苗、看水、看气候、看密植、看品种等“七看”施肥经验和“七分基肥、三分追肥”的施肥制度。在今年晚稻种植和田间管理中，他们即根据全队90％以上的田地是贫瘦山田，土层薄，霜期早和农作物根部对肥料有趋向性（即土壤中那里肥料多，作物根须容易伸到那里去）等特点，在八百四十二亩晚稻田中，根据土层厚薄、土质肥瘦，分别施下了四十到五十担肥料作基肥。在施追肥中，他们又根据“七看”施肥要求，按照全队晚稻田的土壤、禾苗生长等情况，分成四类合理追肥。由于施肥合理，今年全队晚稻，不分山田、洋田、近田、远田都长得同样墨绿茁壮，一类苗占89.7％。在最近一次全县晚稻大检查中，七步公社晚稻荣获全县红旗，七步大队又是红旗社的标兵队。
    肥料管理站在党支部领导下，经过调查研究，还根据公社化后土地联片等特点、改革了原有的积肥，运肥制度，从而既增积了大量肥料，又节省了大量积肥运肥的劳力。今年3月到8月，全队积肥造肥共达九万八千多担，比去年同期增加了82.7％，而积肥造肥所花劳力却比去年节省五分之三左右，半年中约计节省一千五百多个积肥造肥和运肥的劳动日，使积肥运肥的工作量从过去占整个田间作业量的51.84％降低到仅占11.78％。他们的作法，首先是大搞积肥制度改革，大建田间肥料基地网，大力推广就地积肥、就地贮存、就地施用的经验，使全大队田间肥坑、肥池和肥棚由过去的十三个增加到一百八十六个，在半年中就就地积造了八万六千多担肥料，占全队积造肥料总数87.75％。第二是建立常年带肥下田制度。全队把带肥下田作为评比“五好”社员的内容之一，并根据田地远近给予带肥下田的社员以工分补贴，从而鼓励了社员带肥下田的积极性。近半年中在村里积造的一万二千多担人畜粪肥、土杂肥，都由社员下田劳动时带到田头肥坑、肥棚里贮存，既节省运肥下田劳力，又保证随时随地有肥可用，同时还改善了环境卫生。第三，肥料管理站负责定期（每月三次）收购社员家庭积的零星肥料，大大鼓舞了社员业余积肥的积极性。半年多当中，有82％的社员完成了原订家庭积肥、售肥计划，有17％的社员还得到积肥超额奖励。（附图片）
