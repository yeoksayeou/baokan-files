Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th October - Polish News Agency Warsaw, 9th October: Comrade Gomulka, head of the Polish delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 6th of October on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations Organization.

Gomulka said: I firmly believe that in this hall, there is not a single delegation (including the US delegation) that is not clear about who actually represents the great Chinese people: the government of the People's Republic of China, or the puppet regime of Chiang Kai-shek.

Gomulka recounted historical facts, saying: China was a member of the United Nations from its very inception. At that time, China was still old China, a country that was extremely backward due to colonial exploitation and years of war, and was managed by a corrupt group of warlords and bureaucrats who were hostile to the people. Former U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull spoke of this in his diary: "This government is led by the reactionary clique of the Kuomintang, which seeks private gain, is corrupt, and is incapable of managing." Despite this, the United States at that time believed that China was a country worthy of being a member of the United Nations and a member of the Security Council.

Next, Gomulka pointed out: Today, when China has long been liberated from the shackles of colonialism, feudal landlords, and comprador bourgeoisie and has become a great socialist country, when, thanks to the efforts, labor enthusiasm, and discipline of hundreds of millions of liberated people, China is striding forward along the path of modern civilization, when the whole world is amazed by the speed of China's economic development and the prosperity and progress of its culture, some people are refusing it the right to representation in the United Nations.

Gomulka refuted the U.S. government's absurd claims that China "pursues an aggressive and bellicose policy" and "does not hesitate to wage a world war - a war fraught with nuclear danger." He pointed out: The U.S. representative, like all of us, like the people of the whole world, knows perfectly well that the People's Republic of China does not have nuclear weapons, while the United States possesses such weapons of mass destruction. This one fact alone can illustrate how absurd it is to accuse the People's Republic of China of being aggressive and wanting to wage a predatory nuclear war.

China has not occupied a single inch of American land, while the United States occupies an inalienable part of China - Taiwan and other islands. These territories belong to China, as recognized by the Cairo Declaration and reaffirmed by the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, what right is there to call the legitimate demand for the return of these territories to the People's Republic of China aggression? What basis is there for denying China the right to liberate these territories and unify its own territory? It is clear that the United States' actions towards China and the coastal islands of China for the past decade have been armed interference in China's internal affairs. This practice violates China's own indisputable territorial sovereignty, violates international law, and violates international obligations undertaken under treaties. This practice violates the United Nations Charter.

The fact is: it is not the Chinese naval fleet that is anchored off the coast of the United States, but the U.S. fleet that sails in the Taiwan Strait and the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China. The fact is that it is not Chinese military aircraft that violate U.S. airspace, but U.S. aircraft that violate international law and constantly violate the airspace of the People's Republic of China.

The whole world knows that Chiang Kai-shek is constantly clamoring to counterattack the Chinese mainland and fight the People's Republic of China. Everyone knows who supports Chiang Kai-shek and who his backers are. Without U.S. military aid, Chiang Kai-shek would not be able to hold out in Taiwan for a single day.

Gomulka pointed out: The leaders of the People's Republic of China and the leaders of all socialist countries firmly stand on the position of safeguarding and consolidating international peace, while pointing out the roots of past wars and the roots of the current threat of war. Those who do not want the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations are trying to evade the discussion of this issue. I have heard people here citing articles from Chinese Communist Party publications, deliberately misinterpreting them. The basic idea of an article published in Beijing's "Red Flag" magazine, cited by the U.S. representative, is the argument that imperialism is the root cause of war. The U.S. representative, unable to refute this argument, adopted a trick that we call "shifting the blame," instead accusing the People's Republic of China of being imperialist. By analogy, one could also insist that Beijing is located on the banks of the Potomac River (this river is located within the United States - editor's note).

Gomulka also refuted another absurd argument of the U.S. representative: that if the People's Republic of China had representation in the United Nations, it would threaten the freedom and independence of the Congo and the whole of Africa. He said: Does the U.S. representative want to scare the Congo with this ridiculous accusation? The African people see that China is the greatest example of the struggle against colonialism, it is the people who have completely eradicated colonialism and shown all oppressed nations that it is possible to break free from the shackles of imperialism and establish their own independent countries.

Are there Chinese troops, Chinese colonies, Chinese large estates, or Chinese concessions in Africa? But everyone knows that there are no such manifestations of Chinese colonialism and imperialism in Africa or anywhere else. On the other hand, Africa still has British and French colonies, and U.S. military bases. Many countries, although they have gained political independence, have not yet gained economic sovereignty, and therefore, imperialist countries are hindering them from achieving this goal, trying to maintain their economic positions in order to rely on these positions in the future to plunder other people's wealth and extract cheap labor.

The U.S. representative was greatly annoyed because China criticized the UN Secretary-General's actions in the Congo, believing that imperialists were involved in a conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the country's legitimate government and restoring colonialism in a new form. Does the U.S. representative remember that here, on this podium, many countries, especially some African countries, have made similar accusations. However, no one has ever thought of denying the right to representation in the United Nations to those who make these well-founded accusations.

The U.S. representative here groundlessly accused China of aggression against Korea. It is best not to look back at the history of the Korean War, because if we turn over old accounts, we can find many facts that put the United States at a disadvantage, such as President Truman's threat to use atomic bombs against China, etc. The fact is that there are now no Chinese soldiers in North Korea, while South Korea is still occupied by U.S. troops.

The U.S. representative protested against the anti-American demonstrations in China, which are only the fruit of the seeds sown by the United States. There is no doubt that as long as the United States continues to wage a cold war against China, refuses to tolerate the existence of the People's Republic of China, refuses to tolerate the Chinese people's right to choose a system suitable for them, does not stop interfering in China's internal affairs, continues to occupy Chinese territory, and continues to threaten the great Chinese people, it cannot expect the anti-American demonstrations in China to stop, nor can it expect U.S. policy not to be severely condemned.

The U.S. representative does not like China's social system, which is the real reason why the United States opposes recognizing the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations. Representatives of many member states of the United Nations do not like the U.S. social system, but despite this, no one has tried to deny the United States' membership in the United Nations. The essence of the matter is that countries participating in the United Nations are regardless of social system, and we do not ask about the social system of UN member states. The government of the People's Republic of China has been exercising power for eleven years, and therefore, it is a consolidated government. It enjoys the unquestioned support of the entire Chinese people. This situation makes some people happy and others sad, but no responsible politician and no one who seriously observes the Chinese situation doubts these facts.

I would like to cite here the testimony of one person, who can hardly be suspected of sympathizing with communism, and that is British Field Marshal Montgomery, who visited China this spring. He said that the potential hidden in 650 million people has found an opportunity to be tapped and has been led onto a path of positive construction. In China, a huge force has been set in motion, and it would be a good thing for the Western world to establish friendship with China.

Gomulka questioned the British government here, saying: Ten years ago, the British Foreign Secretary declared that the British government no longer recognizes, legally or in fact, the Kuomintang government as the government of any part of Chinese territory. However, the British government still recognizes Chiang Kai-shek's delegation to the United Nations to this day. How is this position logical?

The United States is unwilling to let the People's China enter the United Nations because China's entry means the weakening of the United States' position in this organization, because the United States is keen to use the United Nations as a tool for its cold war policy against socialist countries, as a tool used when colonialism or neo-colonialism clashes with the interests of nations that want to get rid of all dependence.

It is not necessary to go far to find examples, take the proposals to put the so-called "Tibetan issue" or "Hungarian issue" on the agenda, is this not an attempt to use the United Nations as a tool of the Cold War? These are not issues at all, and they do not fall within the jurisdiction of the United Nations.

What role do you want the United Nations to play in the Congo? Isn't it trying to make it a party and tool in the conflict between the people and their legitimate government and colonialism?

Gomulka said: How can the United Nations carry out truly constructive work without the participation of the People's Republic of China, such a great country and a great people that has a major impact on the fate of Asia and the world? Would the United States abide by a disarmament agreement signed without the participation of the People's Republic of China?

Contrary to the unfounded accusations made here against the People's Republic of China, its foreign policy is a peaceful policy, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, "Panchsheel," and the ten principles put forward at the Bandung Conference. Everyone knows that the People's Republic of China is the co-initiator of these principles, which are in line with the United Nations Charter.

The People's Republic of China's peaceful stance is reflected in its specific initiatives, such as its proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact in the Pacific region and to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Far East.

The People's Republic of China strives to peacefully resolve disputes with other countries through friendly negotiations. The border agreements reached with Myanmar and Nepal, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Delhi to resolve the border dispute with India, and negotiations with Indonesia are examples of this.

As long as the People's Republic of China is not in the United Nations, the principle of universality of the United Nations is nothing more than empty talk. The principle of universality also requires the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic into the United Nations.

Gomulka finally pointed out: The delegations present here, the governments represented here, must fully realize that whoever succumbs to pressure and does not allow China to enter the United Nations must bear a heavy responsibility for continuing to implement the policy that paralyzes the power of the United Nations.

Poland advocates the immediate recognition of the seat in the United Nations of the sole legitimate representative of the great Chinese people - the People's Republic of China.

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    哥穆尔卡在联大全体会议上发言
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰通讯社华沙9日讯：波兰出席联合国大会第十五届会议的代表团团长哥穆尔卡6日在联合国大会上就中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题发表了演说。
    哥穆尔卡说：我坚信，在这个大厅中，没有一个代表团（包括美国代表团在内）不清楚，实际代表伟大中国人民的是谁：是中华人民共和国政府，还是蒋介石傀儡政权。
    哥穆尔卡回叙历史事实说：联合国一成立，中国就是联合国会员国。当时中国还是旧中国，这个国家由于殖民主义剥削和多年战争而极端落后，是由腐化的敌视人民的军阀和官僚集团管理的国家。美国前国务卿科德尔·赫尔在自己的日记中谈到这点：“这个政府是由国民党反动集团所领导，这个集团谋求私利，贪污腐化，无能力进行管理。”尽管如此，美国当时认为，中国是无愧于联合国会员国和安全理事会理事国的国家。
    接着，哥穆尔卡指出：今天，当中国早已从殖民主义、封建地主和买办资产阶级的桎梏下解放出来而成为伟大的社会主义国家时，当由于解放了的几亿人的努力、劳动热情和遵守纪律，中国正大踏步地沿着现代文明的道路前进时，当全世界都在为中国经济发展速度和文化繁荣进步而感到惊奇时，却有人拒绝它在联合国的代表权。
    哥穆尔卡驳斥了美国政府所谓中国“奉行侵略和好战政策”以及“不惜进行世界大战——充满核战争危险的大战”等荒谬说法。他指出：美国代表，像我们大家一样，像全世界的人民一样，完全知道，中华人民共和国没有核武器，而美国拥有这样大规模毁灭性武器。仅仅这一个事实就可以说明，非难中华人民共和国有侵略性，说它想进行掠夺性的核战争，是十分荒谬的。
    中国没有占领一块美国土地，而美国却占领中国的不可分割的一部分——台湾和其他岛屿。这些领土之属于中国，是经过开罗宣言承认并经过波茨坦协定重申的。可见，有什么权利把关于将这些领土归还中华人民共和国的合法要求，称为是侵略呢？有什么根据否认中国解放这些领土和统一本国领土的权利呢？由此可见，美国十年来对中国和中国沿海岛屿的做法是对中国内政的武装干涉。这种做法破坏了中国自己的无可争辩的领土的主权，破坏了国际法和根据条约承担的国际义务。这种做法破坏了联合国宪章。
    事实是：不是中国的海军舰队停泊在美国的海岸，而是美国舰队在台湾海峡和中华人民共和国领水驶来驶去。事实是，不是中国军用飞机破坏美国领空，而是美国飞机破坏国际法，不断侵犯中华人民共和国的领空。
    全世界都知道，蒋介石不断扬言要反攻中国大陆，同中华人民共和国作战。大家都知道，谁去支持蒋介石，谁就是他的后盾。没有美国的军事援助，蒋介石在台湾一天也支撑不下去。
    哥穆尔卡指出：中华人民共和国的领导人以及所有社会主义国家的领导人都坚定地站在维护和巩固国际和平的立场上，同时指出过去产生战争的根源以及当前战争威胁的根源。那些不想让中华人民共和国参加联合国的人竭力逃避这个问题的讨论。我在这里听到有人援引中国共产党刊物上的文章，故意加以曲解。美国代表所引用的、北京“红旗”杂志刊载的一篇文章的基本思想是这样一个论点：帝国主义是战争的根源。美国代表没有能够反驳这个论点，就采取我们称之为“嫁祸于人”的手腕，反而指责中华人民共和国为帝国主义。以此类推，也可以硬把北京说成位于巴托马克河（这条河流位于美国境内——编者注）河岸。
    哥穆尔卡又驳斥了美国代表的另一个荒谬论点：如果中华人民共和国在联合国中有代表，它就会威胁到刚果和整个非洲的自由和独立。他说：难道美国代表想用这种简直是可笑的指责来吓唬刚果吗？非洲人民看到，中国是同殖民主义斗争的最伟大的榜样，它是这样的人民：他们彻底根除了殖民主义并向所有被压迫民族表明：有可能挣脱帝国主义的枷锁和建立自己的独立的国家。
    难道在非洲有中国的军队、中国的殖民地、中国的大庄园或中国的租借地吗？而大家知道，无论在非洲或其他任何地方，都没有这些来自中国的殖民主义和帝国主义的表现。另一方面，非洲却仍然有着英国和法国的殖民地，有着美国的军事基地。有许多国家虽然获得了政治独立，但还没有获得经济主权，因此，帝国主义国家阻挠它们达到这个目的，力求保住自己的经济阵地，以便在今后依仗这些阵地掠夺别人的财富和榨取廉价的劳动力。
    由于中国批评联合国秘书长在刚果的行为，认为帝国主义者参与了旨在推翻这个国家的合法政府并使殖民主义以新的形式复辟的阴谋活动，美国代表对此大为恼火。美国代表是否还记得，在这里，在这个讲坛上，许多国家，特别是一些非洲国家，都作了类似的指责。可是，谁也没有想到可以否认进行这些有根据的指责的人在联合国的代表权。
    美国代表在这里无中生有地指责中国对朝鲜进行了侵略。这里最好还是不要回顾朝鲜战争的历史吧，因为如果翻翻老账，就可以找到许多事实使美国处于不利地位，譬如杜鲁门总统曾经威胁要对中国使用原子弹等等，事实是：在朝鲜北方现在已没有一个中国士兵，而朝鲜南方却仍然被美国军队占领着。
    美国代表抗议中国的反美示威，而这只不过是美国播下的种子的果实。毫无疑问，美国只要仍然对中国进行冷战，不容忍中华人民共和国的存在，不容忍中国人民有权选择适合他们的制度，不停止干涉中国内政，仍然占领中国领土和对伟大的中国人民进行威胁，那么，它就不能指望中国的反美示威会停止，不能指望美国的政策不遭到严厉谴责。
    美国代表不喜欢中国的社会制度，这是美国反对承认中华人民共和国在联合国的权利的真正原因。联合国许多会员国的代表不喜欢美国的社会制度，尽管如此，没有人试图否认美国在联合国的会员资格。问题的实质在于，参加联合国的国家是不分社会制度的，我们并不去问联合国会员国的社会制度。中华人民共和国政府行使政权已经十一年了，因此，它是一个巩固的政府。它受到全体中国人民无疑问的支持。这种情况使一些人感到高兴，使另一些人感到难过，但是，无论哪一个负责的政治家和认真观察中国情况的人都不怀疑这些事实。
    我在这里只想引述一个人的证明，对这个人很难怀疑他是同情共产主义的，这就是今年春天访问过中国的英国元帅蒙哥马利。他说，六亿五千万人中蕴藏的潜力已经找到了发挥的机会，并被引上积极的建设的道路。在中国，巨大的力量行动起来了，西方世界如果同中国建立友谊，那是一件好事。
    哥穆尔卡在这里质问英国政府说：十年以前英国外交大臣曾经声明，英国政府在法律上和在事实上都不再认为国民党政府是中国任何一部分领土的政府。然而英国政府直到今天还承认蒋介石在联合国的代表团。这种立场怎么合乎逻辑呢？
    美国不愿让人民中国进入联合国，因为中国的进入意味着美国在这个组织中的阵地的削弱，因为美国热中于利用联合国作为自己对付社会主义国家的冷战政策的工具，作为殖民主义或新殖民主义同希望摆脱一切依赖的民族的利益发生冲突时所使用的工具。
    不必到很远的地方去找例子，就拿关于要把所谓“西藏问题”或“匈牙利问题”列入议程的建议来说，这不是企图利用联合国作为冷战的工具，又是什么呢？这些根本不是什么问题，而且不属于联合国的权限。
    想叫联合国在刚果扮演什么角色呢？难道不是想叫它在人民和他们的合法政府同殖民主义之间的冲突中作为冲突的一方和工具吗？
    哥穆尔卡说：没有中华人民共和国这样一个对亚洲和世界的命运有着重大影响的伟大国家和伟大人民的参加，联合国怎么能进行真正的建设性的工作呢？在没有中华人民共和国参加之下签订的裁军协定，难道美国会服从吗？
    与有人在这里对中华人民共和国提出的毫无根据的指责相反，它的外交政策是和平的政策，是以和平共处原则、“潘查希拉”和万隆会议提出的十项原则为基础的。大家知道，中华人民共和国是这些原则的共同倡议人，这些原则是符合联合国宪章的。
    中华人民共和国的和平立场反映在中华人民共和国的具体倡议上，例如，它建议缔结太平洋地区的互不侵犯公约和在远东建立无核武器区。
    中华人民共和国努力谋求通过友好谈判的方式同其他国家和平解决争端问题。同缅甸和尼泊尔达成的边界协定、周恩来总理为解决同印度的边界纠纷而访问德里、同印度尼西亚的谈判等就是这方面的例证。
    只要在联合国中没有中华人民共和国，那么联合国的普遍性原则就不过是一句空话。普遍性原则也要求接纳蒙古人民共和国进入联合国。
    哥穆尔卡最后指出：在座的代表团、在这里有代表的政府必须充分认识到，谁屈服于压力而不让中国进入联合国，谁就要对继续执行那种使联合国的力量瘫痪的政策负重大的责任。
    波兰主张立即承认伟大中国人民的唯一合法代表——中华人民共和国在联合国的席位。
