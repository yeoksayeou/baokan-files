	Harvest songs filled the mountain hollow,
	Autumn rain poured down relentlessly,
	The secretary bent over, harvesting soybeans,
	Sweat and raindrops hung on his brow.
	The old man watched, his heart aching,
	He couldn't help but speak:
	"The wind is so cold, the rain so heavy,
	Old Wang, why not put down your sickle?"
	The secretary wiped away the raindrops,
	His sickle swished and swished,
	"Harvest soybeans while it rains to prevent shattering,
	As long as we harvest one more handful,
	What's a little wind and rain!"
	The secretary's words are like a torch,
	The commune members are full of enthusiasm,
	The sickles cut through the rain,
	Sweating, unafraid of the cold wind,
	Cart after cart of soybeans brought down the mountain.

    割豆子
    刘章丰收歌子满山洼，秋雨刷刷一个劲下，书记弯腰割豆子，汗珠雨珠眉尖上挂。老大爷越看越心疼，憋不住就说了话：“风这冷，雨这大，老王呀，还不把镰放下。”书记擦掉水珠，手里镰刀沙沙，“趁水割豆不炸角，只要多收一把，风风雨雨算个啥！”书记的话呀像火把，社员个个干劲大，镰刀割断雨线，流汗不怕冷风刮，车车豆子把山下。
