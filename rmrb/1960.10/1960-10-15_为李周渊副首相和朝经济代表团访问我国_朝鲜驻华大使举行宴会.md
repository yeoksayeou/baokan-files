Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: North Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight for the visit to China of Li Jooyun, Vice Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the North Korean government economic delegation he led.
    Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Li Xiannian, and Luo Ruiqing were invited to attend the banquet.
    Vice Premier Li Jooyun spoke at the banquet, warmly praising the fraternal friendship between the people of North Korea and China. He said that through the common struggle against imperialist aggression and close cooperation in building socialism, the friendship between the people of our two countries is becoming closer day by day. He said that during the war against American imperialist aggression, the Chinese people aided the Korean people with their blood; today, the Chinese people continue to provide enormous assistance to our country's socialist construction. We will never forget the brotherly deep friendship and proletarian internationalist assistance of the Chinese people to the Korean people. Vice Premier Li Jooyun said that before long, the Korean people will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into North Korea to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Every year, the Korean people commemorate the day the Volunteers entered North Korea as a day of close unity between the people of North Korea and China.
    Speaking about the socialist construction of the two countries, Vice Premier Li Jooyun said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red flags, have achieved tremendous achievements in socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people are galloping forward valiantly on the Chollima in the struggle for socialist construction. Vice Premier Li Jooyun said that all the achievements made by our two countries have made a great contribution to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke at the banquet, expressing warm congratulations on the success of the talks between the economic delegations of the Chinese and North Korean governments and the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the people of China and North Korea are close comrades-in-arms and also brothers in the socialist family. Our two countries have always been closely united, supported each other, and advanced together in the common cause of opposing imperialist aggression and building socialism. He said that in the war against American imperialist aggression, the Korean people, with dauntless heroism, defeated the aggression of the world's most ferocious American imperialism, not only defending the independence of their own country but also safeguarding the security of our country. This is a great support for the peaceful construction of the Chinese people. In this great just war, the most outstanding sons and daughters of the two countries fought side by side, their blood flowing together, which is a concentrated expression of the noble proletarian internationalist spirit of the people of our two countries.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that in recent years, with the high-speed leap forward in the socialist construction of our two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have achieved more comprehensive development, which has not only promoted the socialist construction of the two countries but also further strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian warmly praised the heroic Korean people for continuously speeding forward along the road of socialist construction under the strong leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, relying on their own hardworking hands and selfless labor, and achieving great achievements.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that the Chinese people have always believed that mutual assistance and support between socialist countries is a sacred and glorious obligation that we should fulfill in the socialist family, and it is also for our common interests. The Chinese people are very willing to contribute their share to the cause of socialist construction of the Korean people. Because our country has not yet shaken off the economically backward situation left over from the old society, our assistance to the Korean people is still very limited. However, the Chinese people firmly believe that with the continuous leap forward in the socialist construction of our two countries, the fraternal relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries will be continuously strengthened, and the economies of our two countries will continue to achieve common high growth.
    Ambassador Li Yong-ho spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that we are very happy that the Korean government economic delegation has made a successful visit to China. I firmly believe that the internationalist friendship and cooperation between North Korea and China will be further consolidated and developed in the future. When the ambassador spoke about the signing of two economic agreements between the two governments yesterday, he pointed out that this is another event of great significance in the friendship and unity between the people of North Korea and China.
    Also invited to attend today's banquet were: Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Duan Junyi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, as well as the heads of relevant government departments, Beijing Municipality, and the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, etc.

    新华社14日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相李周渊和他率领的朝鲜政府经济代表团访问中国，今晚在北京饭店举行宴会。
    国务院副总理贺龙、李先念、罗瑞卿应邀出席了宴会。
    李周渊副首相在宴会上讲话，热情称颂朝中两国人民的兄弟友谊。他说，通过反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争，通过建设社会主义的紧密合作，我们两国人民的友情一天比一天紧密起来。他说，在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争时期，中国人民用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民；今天中国人民又继续给予我国的社会主义建设以巨大的援助。中国人民对朝鲜人民的兄弟般的深情厚谊和无产阶级国际主义援助，我们是永远不会忘记的。李周渊副首相说，再过不久，朝鲜人民就要纪念中国人民志愿军入朝参加抗美援朝战争十周年。朝鲜人民每年都把志愿军入朝这一天，当做朝中两国人民紧密团结的日子来纪念。
    李周渊副首相在讲到两国的社会主义建设时说，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举三面红旗，在社会主义建设方面取得了巨大成就。朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，在社会主义建设的斗争中，跨上千里马，奋勇前进。李周渊副首相说，我们两国所取得的一切成就，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，作出了巨大贡献。
    李先念副总理在宴会上讲话，对中朝两国政府经济代表团会谈的胜利和两国友好合作关系的进一步发展，表示热烈的祝贺。
    李先念副总理说，中朝两国人民是亲密的战友，同时也是社会主义大家庭中的兄弟。我们两国在反对帝国主义侵略和建设社会主义的共同事业中，一向紧密团结，相互支援，共同前进的。他说，朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争中，以大无畏的英雄气概击败了世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义的侵略，不仅保卫了自己祖国的独立，而且也维护了我国的安全。这对中国人民的和平建设事业是一个巨大的支援。在这场伟大的正义的战争中，两国人民最优秀的儿女，并肩作战，他们的鲜血流在一起，这是我们两国人民崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的集中表现。
    李先念副总理说，近几年来，随着我们两国社会主义建设事业的高速度跃进，两国之间的友好合作关系获得了更加全面的发展，这不仅促进了两国的社会主义建设事业，而且也进一步增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。
    李先念副总理热烈赞颂英雄的朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，依靠自己勤劳的双手和忘我的劳动，沿着社会主义建设的大道不断飞驰前进，取得了伟大的成就。
    李先念副总理强调指出：中国人民一向认为社会主义国家间互相帮助和支援是我们在社会主义大家庭中应尽的神圣而光荣的义务，同时也是为了我们共同的利益。中国人民十分愿意为朝鲜人民的社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的一分力量。由于目前我国尚未摆脱旧社会遗留下来的经济上落后的状况，我们对朝鲜人民的帮助还是非常有限的。但是中国人民深信，随着我们两国社会主义建设的不断跃进，我们两国之间兄弟般的互助合作关系必将不断得到加强，我们两国的经济必将不断获得共同的高涨。
    李永镐大使在宴会开始时讲话。他说，朝鲜政府经济代表团在中国进行了成功的访问，我们感到十分高兴。我深信，朝中两国的国际主义友谊和合作，今后将会进一步得到巩固和发展。大使讲到两国政府昨天签订两个经济协定的时候，指出这是朝中两国人民友谊和团结中的又一个具有重大意义的事件。
