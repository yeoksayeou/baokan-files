Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory Ironmaking Workshop Holds High the Red Flag of Small Blast Furnace Production
    Manually Creating Rich Ore  Greatly Increasing Pig Iron Production
    Workers Vigorously Carry Out Technical Innovation, Promoting Sintering of Mineral Powder, Achieving High Quality and High Yield, Saving a Large Amount of Resources

    (Our Dispatch)  The workers of the Ironmaking Workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory in Shandong Province, displaying soaring revolutionary drive and scientific realism, adopted indigenous methods to vigorously engage in mineral powder sintering. This not only fully utilized all available mineral resources such as powder ore and tailings, but also sintered the original low-grade, high-sulfur ore into high-grade, high-basicity, low-sulfur, low-oxidation artificial rich ore. This enabled the small blast furnace to consume fine and cooked materials, effectively promoting high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption pig iron production. From January to August this year, the workshop had already completed 92.4% of its annual production plan, with the pig iron qualification rate maintained above 90%, reaching a maximum of 100%. The coke ratio and costs have also significantly decreased, making it a red flag unit in small blast furnace production.
    The ore used by the Ironmaking Workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory was of poor quality, with a general furnace charge grade of about 38% to 40%, high sulfur content, and fluctuating basicity, causing many difficulties for small blast furnace production. Starting in January of this year, the workshop's workers changed their past practice of simply roasting the ore before putting it into the blast furnace and instead implemented mineral powder sintering, vigorously creating artificial rich ore. Due to the adoption of mineral powder sintering, impurities such as sulfur were removed from the ore during processing, crushing, washing, magnetic separation, and roasting, raising the ore grade to 65%, and reducing the sulfur content from 0.05% to 1% down to 0.01%. At the same time, it effectively increased the basicity of the sintered ore, reduced the iron oxide content, and enhanced the ore's self-fluxing properties. Coupled with the adoption of high-wind, high-temperature technology, the coke ratio was greatly reduced, and the amount of raw limestone charged into the furnace was also greatly reduced, which greatly improved the production and quality of pig iron. The implementation of mineral powder sintering also enabled the full utilization of previously discarded ore resources such as powder ore, tailings, and return ore, increasing the ore utilization rate by 10% compared to last year. From January to August, the workshop saved a total of more than 1,600 tons of mineral powder, increasing the production of good iron by more than 1,200 tons.
    In the process of vigorously developing artificial rich ore and promoting mineral powder sintering, the workshop's workers fully demonstrated their spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and continuous revolution. At the beginning of implementing mineral powder sintering, due to lack of experience, the sintered ore had a low grade and contained as much as 30% or more of iron oxide. The workshop's Party organization sent people to advanced units to learn, and at the same time, organized leading cadres to go deep into the sintering section to work shifts, analyzing and studying the reasons together with workers and technicians. They discovered that the high iron oxide content was due to the fact that the mineral powder was not washed and screened, had large particle sizes, and had high, uneven moisture content. Therefore, in order to sinter it into blocks, it was necessary to add more coke fines; if too much coke fines were added, the sintering temperature would be too high, and the iron oxide would increase. Therefore, they implemented artificial washing, controlled the particle size of mineral powder and coke fines, and implemented strict testing methods, breaking through the technical barrier of iron oxide. After this barrier was broken through, the effect of promoting high quality and high yield was not significant due to low basicity. The workers then launched research work to improve the basicity, and finally used indigenous methods to sinter artificial rich ore with high grade, high basicity, low sulfur content, and low oxidation.
    In terms of sintering methods, they changed the sintering kiln method and promoted the advanced experience of stacking and placing the furnace bottom for sintering: a ventilation pipe was placed on the flat ground, and then two layers of sintered ore blocks of about 10 centimeters were arranged up and down around the head of the ventilation pipe to form a wind tunnel for sintering. This not only saved manpower and materials, but also saved kiln construction time and improved work efficiency. Every five or six hours, about ten tons of rich ore can be sintered, and the sintering rate is increased to more than 85%.
    After the sintering technology barrier was broken through, the prominent difficulty encountered was the insufficient labor and poor quality of manual washing and screening, and iron ore powder was easily washed away with water. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Party organization fully mobilized the masses and vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution through methods such as holding sintered ore exhibitions and production sports meets. The workers used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, collected and used the factory's waste materials, and successively manufactured washing machines, magnetic separators, sintering mixing machines, tailings recovery machines, coke drying machines, coke fining machines, etc., so that all sintering processes were mechanized. After continuous innovation, they have now realized the continuous operation line of ore crushing, washing, and magnetic separation, and production efficiency has been further improved. The average amount of sintered ore per person has increased from 1.4 tons to more than 1.8 tons.
    Currently, in the production increase and economy practice campaign centered on grain and steel, the workers of the entire workshop have set new targets and measures, striving to achieve the "one-stop" operation of sintering powder ore and the electrification of transportation as soon as possible, and striving to further improve the quantity and quality of products.

    济南印染厂炼铁车间高举小高炉生产红旗
    人工造富矿  生铁大增产
    职工大闹技术革新，推行矿粉烧结，实现优质高产，节约大量资源
    本报讯　山东省济南印染厂炼铁车间职工，发扬冲天的革命干劲和科学的求实精神，采用土办法，大搞矿粉烧结，既充分利用了粉矿、尾矿等一切可以利用的矿石资源，又把原来品位低、硫分高的矿石烧结成高品位、高碱度、低硫分、低氧化的人造富矿，使小高炉吃上了精料、熟料，有效地促进了生铁优质、高产、低消耗。今年1至8月，这个车间已经完成全年生产计划的92.4％，生铁合格率保持在90％以上，最高达到100％，焦比和成本也都有显著下降，成为小高炉生产的一面红旗。
    济南印染厂炼铁车间使用的矿石质量不高，一般的入炉品位在38％至40％左右，硫分高，碱度也忽高忽低，给小高炉生产带来许多困难。今年1月开始，这个车间的职工改变了过去把矿石焙烧一下就投入高炉的作法，实行矿粉烧结，大搞人造富矿。由于采用了矿粉烧结的办法，矿石在加工粉碎、淘洗、磁选、焙烧过程中除去了硫分等杂质，使矿石品位提高到65％，硫分由0.05％至1％降低到0.01％。同时，有效地提高了烧结矿的碱度，降低了氧化铁含量，增强了矿石的自熔性。加上采用大风、高温技术，焦比大大降低，入炉生石灰量也大为减少，这就使得生铁的产量和质量大大提高。实行矿粉烧结，又使粉矿、尾矿、返矿过去抛掉不用的矿石资源都全部利用起来，矿石利用率比去年提高了10％。1至8月份，这个车间共节约矿粉达一千六百多吨，增产好铁一千二百多吨。
    在大办人造富矿，推行矿粉烧结的过程中，这个车间的职工充分发扬了敢想敢干和不断革命的精神。在开始实行矿粉烧结时，由于缺乏经验，烧结矿的品位低，含氧化铁高达30％以上。车间党组织就一面派人到先进单位学习，一面组织领导干部深入烧结工段跟班劳动，和工人、技术人员一起分析研究原因，发现了氧化铁多是由于矿粉没有洗选，粒度大，水分高，不净不匀，因此，要烧结成块，就靠多加焦末；焦末加多了，烧结的温度太高，氧化铁就增多了。于是，他们便实行了人工淘洗和控制矿粉、焦末粒度和严格化验等办法，突破了氧化铁的技术关。这一关突破了，可是由于碱度低，对促进优质高产的效果不显著。职工们又展开了提高碱度的研究工作，终于用土法烧结出高品位、高碱度、低硫分、低氧化的人造富矿。
    在烧结方法上，他们改变了烧结窑的方法，推行了烧结堆摆炉底的先进经验：在平地放一条进风管，然后围绕风管头用十厘米左右的烧结矿块，上下排成两层，构成风道，进行烧结。这样既节省人力物力，又节省建窑时间，提高了工效。每五、六小时，就能烧结十吨左右的富矿，烧结率提高到85％以上。
    烧结技术关突破后，遇到的突出困难，是人工淘洗、筛选劳力不足，质量不高，铁矿粉又易随水冲走。为了克服这个困难，党组织通过开烧结矿展览会、生产运动会等办法，充分发动群众，大搞技术革新与技术革命。职工们采用土洋结合的方法，搜集和运用厂里的废料，连续制成了淘洗机、磁选机、烧结拌料机、尾矿回收机、烘焦机、轧焦末机等，使烧结工序全部实现了机械化。经过不断革新，现在，他们又实现了矿石粉碎、淘洗、磁选联动作业线，生产效率进一步提高。每人平均烧结矿量已由一点四吨提高到一点八吨以上。
    目前，在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，全车间职工又订出了新的指标和措施，力争尽快实现烧结粉矿的“一条龙”操作和运输电车化，对产品的数量和质量也力求进一步提高。
