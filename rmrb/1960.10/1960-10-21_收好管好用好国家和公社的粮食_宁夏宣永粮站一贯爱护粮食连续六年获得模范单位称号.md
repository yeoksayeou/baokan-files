Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 20th: The state grain warehouse managed by the staff of the Xuanyong Grain Station of the Zhongwei County Grain Bureau in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has never experienced any accidents involving insects, mold, or other losses of grain. The grain station staff also helps nearby communes to properly collect, manage, and utilize grain, run public canteens well, and achieve planned grain consumption and grain conservation. Since 1954, this grain station has been awarded the title of model unit and advanced unit for six consecutive years.

The warehouse conditions at this grain station are not ideal. The original warehouse buildings were dilapidated after years of disrepair, with a lot of bird droppings, insect cocoons, insect droppings, and rats. The warehouse was damp and dark. The grain station had seven storage points (later five), each two or thirty *li* apart, while the station only had nine employees. The annual workload was heavy, and the task of protecting grain was very arduous. However, under the education of the Party, all the staff members have worked hard. Since 1950, they have consistently adhered to the grain protection system of a minor inspection every five days, a major inspection every half month, inspections at any time it rains, and a monthly test and a quarterly general survey and ranking in grain storage. During inspections, they make sure to visit every warehouse, inspect every grain, and conduct thorough inspections. Before the annual grain enters the warehouse, they generally clean and disinfect the warehouse, caulk and paint the cracks, lay the floor, and scrape off insect droppings and cocoons, so that the warehouse is spotless in all directions. All these tasks are done by the staff themselves, without hiring a single temporary worker, thus saving the state a total of 5,022 yuan in expenses. In terms of laying the floor, with a spirit of bold innovation, they abolished the past method of laying the floor with sesame stalks and adopted a mixture of three parts (pebbles, sand, slag) and gypsum, which is not only rat-proof, moisture-proof, and mildew-proof, but also saves labor, materials, time, and expenses. The sesame stalk item alone can save more than 20,000 *jin* per year. They also learned from the experience of other places and achieved grain storage without bags and oil storage without barrels. Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned effective measures, the grain loss rate has been greatly reduced, and a total of more than 67,000 *jin* of grain has been saved for the state in the past four years.

The Xuanyong Grain Station also helps the Dengta People's Commune to properly collect, manage, and utilize grain. Every year during the summer and autumn harvest season, the grain station helps the commune arrange labor and organize careful harvesting and threshing. This year's summer harvest, they helped the commune organize members to pick up wheat ears, picking up more than 5,000 *jin* of wheat. The grain station's achievements are even more outstanding in helping the commune's basic accounting units to uniformly manage grain. They helped major brigades select warehouse locations, repair warehouses, and train 57 grain storage personnel. In the past year, the grain station has also helped major brigades establish various systems for grain storage, warehouse cleaning and disinfection, cleaning and hygiene, and grain in and out of warehouses. Now, the Dengta Commune's grain has achieved in-warehouse records, out-warehouse evidence, and stockhead cards and grain protection covenants in every warehouse. Each warehouse has a water tank in summer and sandbags in winter, bird-proof curtains hanging on the doors, inspections every five days, and cleaning every week. Since 1958, the 155 warehouses in the entire Dengta Commune have basically achieved no insects, no mold, and no losses.

In order to help the commune run the canteens well, the Xuanyong Grain Station staff abolished their own canteen, and the staff went to eat at the canteen of the Second Production Team of the Futang Management Area. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, they focused on the canteen of the Second Production Team and provided comprehensive assistance from democratic management, family production, basic construction, management system to planned grain consumption and grain conservation. In the past few months, they have helped various canteens establish management systems related to planned grain consumption and grain conservation, such as "three accounts," "two receipts," "three registers," "four tables," and "two tickets." The "three accounts" are grain revenue and expenditure account, physical cash account, and member transaction account; the "two receipts" are physical receipts and cash receipts; the "three registers" are grain and oil planned practical registration book, vegetable registration book, and grain ticket and meal ticket registration book; the "four tables" are grain consumption plan table, per capita quantitative calculation table, grain saving report form, and physical cash announcement table; the "two tickets" are member meal tickets and grain saving tickets. After gaining experience through these typical trials, they were promoted throughout the commune under the leadership of the commune Party Committee. Now, the planned grain consumption and grain conservation work of each canteen in the Dengta Commune is done very well.

    收好管好用好国家和公社的粮食
    宁夏宣永粮站一贯爱护粮食连续六年获得模范单位称号
    新华社银川20日电　宁夏回族自治区中卫县粮食局宣永粮站职工所管的国家粮食仓库，从来没有发生过虫、霉等损失粮食的事故。粮站职工还帮助附近公社收好、管好、用好粮食，办好公共食堂，做到了计划用粮和节约用粮。从1954年以来，这个粮站已经连续六年获得模范单位和先进单位的称号。
    这个粮站的仓库条件并不好。仓库用屋原来年久失修，鸟粪、虫茧、虫屎和老鼠很多，仓内潮湿阴暗。粮站贮粮点有七处（后来是五处），每个贮粮点相距二、三十里，而站里只有职工九名，每年的工作量很大，保粮任务很艰巨。但是，全站职工在党的教育下，艰苦奋斗，从1950年起，十年来在粮食的保管上一贯坚持了五日一小查、半月一大查、下雨随时查和每月一化验、每季普查排队的保粮制度。检查时，做到有仓必到，有粮必查，查必彻底。在每年粮食入库之前，普遍对仓库进行清仓消霉，嵌缝粉刷，铺垫地坪，剔刮虫屎虫茧，使仓内四面八方一尘不染。这些工作都是职工们亲自动手做的，没有请过一个临时工，因此共为国家节约用费五千零二十二元。在铺垫地坪方面，他们以大胆革新的精神，废除了过去用胡麻秆铺地的方法，采用三合土（卵石、砂子、炉渣）和石膏铺地，不仅能防鼠、防潮、防霉，并且节省劳力、物料、时间和费用。仅胡麻秆一项，每年就可以节省两万多斤。他们还学习外地经验，做到了贮粮不用袋，贮油不用桶。由于采取上述种种有效措施，大大降低了粮食损耗率，近四年来共为国家节约粮食六万七千多斤。
    宣永粮站还帮助灯塔人民公社收好、管好、用好粮食。每年夏秋收割季节，粮站就帮助公社安排劳力，组织细收细打。今年夏收，他们帮助公社组织社员拾麦穗，拾回麦子五千多斤。在帮助公社的基本核算单位统一保管粮食上，粮站的成绩更为突出。他们帮助各大队选仓点，修仓房，培训粮食保管人员五十七人。一年来，粮站还帮助各大队建立了粮食保管、清仓消霉、清洁卫生、粮食出入库等各项制度。现在，灯塔公社的粮食已做到入库有账，出库有据，库库有囤头卡片和保粮公约。每座仓房，夏天有水缸，冬天有砂袋，门上挂防雀帘，五天一检查，一周一清扫。从1958年以来，全灯塔公社的一百五十五座仓房，基本实现了无虫、无霉、无损失。
    宣永粮站职工为了帮助公社办好食堂，撤销了自己的食堂，职工们都到福堂管理区第二生产队的食堂吃饭，他们在党委领导下，以第二生产队的食堂为重点，从民主管理、家底生产、基本建设、管理制度到计划用粮和节约用粮，全面地进行帮助。几个月来，共帮助各食堂建立了“三账”、“两据”、“三簿”、“四表”、“二票”等有关计划用粮和节约用粮的管理制度。“三账”是粮食收支存用账、实物现金账、社员往来账；“两据”是实物收据、现金收据；“三簿”是粮油计划实用登记簿、蔬菜登记簿、粮票饭票登记簿；“四表”是用粮计划表、以人定量计算表、节约粮食报表、实物现金公布表；“二票”是社员餐票、节约粮票。通过这些典型试办取得经验以后，就在公社党委领导下在全公社进行推广。现在，灯塔公社各个食堂的计划用粮和节约用粮工作都做得很好。
