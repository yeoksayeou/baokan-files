Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 10th: TASS reports that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev gave a speech on US television on the 9th. The talk took the form of a dialogue with an American radio commentator, Susskind.

When Khrushchev talked about the government systems and relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, he said that he did not want to argue about whose government was more representative and whose system was more democratic. He said, "You want to drag me into a debate about your government. But I don't think I should get involved in this matter, because it's your government, let the American people judge your government."

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government is the most peace-loving government in the world. "You say that the American people are also peace-loving, and I believe you on this point. You also say that therefore the American government is also peace-loving, so I also raise this question to you."

Khrushchev then recounted his talks with the US President in the United States last year. He said, "I had a good talk with him. After I returned to my country, I reported to my people that we are forming some conditions that may establish good relations with the United States. And this is exactly the ideal of our people, the Soviet government, and all the people. Because, if there are good relations between the United States and us, then there will be peace, and peace will exist between us and in the whole world." Khrushchev said, "What did the US government do after this? Before we met in Paris, the US government sent a 'U-2' spy plane to invade Soviet territory. Later, an 'RB-47' reconnaissance plane was sent for the second time. Can this be considered friendly?" He said, "Sending invading aircraft does not help improve our relations, does not help the cause of peace, and on the contrary, will incite fanaticism and intensify relations. If these flights continue in the future, it may lead to war."

Susskind asked Khrushchev to bury the "U-2" plane incident and not bring it up again, and to agree to the international arbitration requested by the US government on the "RB-47" plane incident.

Khrushchev said that no matter how acute any relationship has become, it will lose its acuteness over time. But the "U-2" plane is not a dead horse. If American spy planes fly to the Soviet Union in the future, we will shoot them down, which may lead to war. After the US President said he had canceled the flights, the "RB-47" plane flew over, which was more of a replay of the flight incident than a cancellation of the flight. American military or intelligence agencies had also prepared to send another spy plane to us before I left for the UN to attend the meeting.

Khrushchev said that the US government asked the Soviet Union to agree to international arbitration on the "RB-47" plane. The Soviet Union does not accept this. The best arbitration in this matter is only one, that is, do not send spy planes to each other. Why is it necessary to do this? Let us be friendly, let us not harm each other anymore, and do not infringe on the sovereignty of other countries.

Susskind asked Khrushchev whether he agreed with the US government's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to hold so-called "referendums" in various countries to determine what social system they wanted. Khrushchev replied, "It seems that you don't know much about history. When the October Revolution was completed, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan sent troops into our country. They imposed civil war and armed intervention on us. This was a referendum on what kind of system the people of our country wanted."

He said, "We fought a war, that is to say, we conducted a poll, for four years. The people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union picked up brooms and swept all the armed interventionists—Americans, British, French, and Germans—into the sea."

He said, "If anyone wants to impose this kind of investigation on the Soviet Union, we will not evade it. We will clean it up! Our land is sacred and inviolable. We do not interfere in your affairs. You can live as you want. But do not interfere in our affairs. We will live according to our wishes. Why put your noses in our vegetable garden? Who invited you? Don't you have enough of your own business in America?"

Khrushchev's stern condemnation of American interference in other countries' internal affairs made Susskind furious, and he even used the word "barking at the moon" to treat Khrushchev. Khrushchev interrupted him and said: "When you talk to people, is it considered normal here to use the words 'barking at the moon'? In our country, this is considered impolite. I am old enough to be your father, how can you be so rude to me, young man. You look good on the outside, but your speech is not very polite. I cannot tolerate this attitude towards me. I am not here to bark. I am the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the greatest socialist country in the world. You must respect me, and if you don't want to act like this, then don't invite people to talk. You must be polite. Maybe you are used to humming at everyone. But we are a country that cannot be offended."

Answering a question about the Soviet Union's proposal to reorganize the United Nations, Khrushchev said that if the United Nations follows the United States step by step and solves problems unilaterally in the way it solves problems now, it will lose the respect and trust of the countries and peoples who need to solve problems. In this case, the people of all countries will not turn to the United Nations, but will strive to solve such problems themselves. He said, "If someone wants to humiliate us, the Soviet Union, in the United Nations and put us in a subordinate position, then we can live without the United Nations, just like our country has lived for many centuries." This means that if any country violates our sovereignty and touches our interests, we will defend these interests with our own strength. Even if we are threatened with war, we are not afraid. We will resolutely defend the independence of our country and our great achievements.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union does not seek any privileges for itself; what we hope is that in the United Nations, socialist countries, countries participating in the American group, and neutral countries are all equal. This is fair. If even this is not taken into consideration, then not only we, but other countries will no longer respect the United Nations, and then the United Nations will cease to exist and gradually die.

Talking about the German and West Berlin issues, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union hopes to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys. It will soon be sixteen years since the end of the war, but there is still no peace treaty. Anyone who hopes to normalize the post-war situation will reach the conclusion that a peace treaty with Germany must be concluded. Concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys (obviously, there is no other way out) can also solve the problem of the West Berlin occupation system. He said, "We believe this is legitimate: West Berlin has its own social system—there is a capitalist system there. We do not want to interfere in West Berlin's internal affairs. Let its residents live under the capitalist system as they do now, let them have their own autonomous bodies; let West Berlin maintain contact with all countries it wishes to maintain contact with, but the West Berlin occupation system must be abolished."

Talking about the United States' control over the United Nations, Khrushchev said that in the United Nations, the representatives of those countries that are politically and economically dependent on the United States are under pressure. But this pressure will soon come to an end. The moment will come when the people get rid of the influence of the United States, and then the United States will be in the minority in the United Nations.

(After Khrushchev finished this answer, there was a moment of rest. News bulletins appeared on the television screen, calling on people to listen to the vicious broadcasts of the "Free Europe" radio station. Someone reported this provocative fact to Khrushchev. Khrushchev said to Susskind, "Someone told me that during the break, all kinds of anti-Soviet slanders were broadcast on this line. Why are you doing this? You are afraid of communism, afraid of the truth! It doesn't matter, let them broadcast. We are not afraid of this, we will only become more consolidated.")

After the break, Susskind tried to ask a series of pre-prepared questions.

Khrushchev interrupted him and said: "You asked me to answer simply, but you yourself are elaborating on your program. This way I will have to answer until tomorrow morning. I think you want to put me in a situation where you ask questions but don't let me answer them. You want to read all the questions and then say, 'The talk is over.' It won't work this way."

Khrushchev then answered the question about the purpose of the Soviet delegation's activities at the United Nations, saying, "Our main wish, the wish of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, is to live in peace and friendship with all countries. We also very much hope to see the American people and the American government have this wish. I believe that sooner or later there will be a situation where we get along in friendship, because friendship will enable us to develop our economy and culture. And war brings disaster, so we advocate peace, we advocate friendship. Let our earth always be filled with peace and never have war." He said, "Why do I want war? I have many grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren."

Khrushchev also said that the Soviet Union has submitted a declaration to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion, proposing the elimination of the colonialist system. He said, "There are still many colonies, where people are still suffering from the pain of colonialist slavery. Let's liberate them too. We advocate complete freedom for the people of every country. For example, in our country, each of the fifteen independent republics can withdraw from the Soviet Union if it wishes, and it has the right to do so."

Talking about disarmament, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is prepared to sign a treaty on disarmament and the destruction of weapons, and let the United States propose the supervision of the destruction of weapons and disarmament, as well as the system for such supervision. Whatever suggestions they make, we will accept, because we advocate real supervision, which is in our common interest. But what the US President is talking about is not disarmament, but only supervision of armaments. We agree to supervision, and we also agree to investigation. But supervise what? Because if there is no disarmament, there is nothing to supervise.

Khrushchev said: "We don't want to keep any armaments. We want to eliminate all armaments. Our goal is not to keep weapons, and not to have wars between countries. But you want to destroy some weapons and keep some. Why keep some? Obviously, it is for war." He said, "The Soviet Union is prepared to achieve disarmament, this is the main thing. The Soviet Union will never agree to investigation and supervision without disarmament, because this is espionage."

Khrushchev agreed with Susskind's statement that when two political concepts conflict and cannot reach an agreement on many issues, then both sides should show a willingness to negotiate and reach some constructive decisions, because both sides believe that war is unthinkable. Khrushchev also believes that negotiation is the only way in this case. Khrushchev said, "We have different philosophies. You have a bourgeois philosophy, and our philosophy is communism. We cannot reach an agreement on this issue, and we don't need to try to reach an agreement in this regard. Differences in viewpoints and philosophical concepts should not lead to war between our two countries. We should coexist." He said, "We want peace. You can develop your economy and manage your country on the basis of capitalism. We will not interfere in your internal affairs, and you should not interfere in our internal affairs."

Talking about the issue of establishing a system for embargoing weapons to African countries,

Khrushchev said that we suggested doing this long ago. We have suggested concluding a treaty so that no country can sell weapons to other countries. However, the US government did not adopt our suggestion. He said, "Let us sign such an agreement. We want peace, not war, and we will do everything we can to consolidate peace." He said, "Why give weapons to these new countries? They need food, they need machines to develop their economies. They don't need weapons. If no one interferes in their internal affairs, they will not take up weapons themselves."

Susskind finally asked Khrushchev if he was prepared to attend a summit meeting with the future President of the United States?

Khrushchev replied, "Not only willing, but I think we must meet." He said, "We are willing to take all wise steps to improve relations between our two countries and establish peace and friendship." He said, "We are willing to meet, willing to conduct appropriate talks, and willing to sign such an agreement to ensure peace between our two countries and friendship between the people of all countries."

### 赫鲁晓夫在美国电视台发表谈话

    赫鲁晓夫在美国电视台发表谈话
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9日在美国电视台发表谈话，这次谈话是以同美国的一个电台评论员萨斯凯因德对话的形式进行的。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到有关苏美两国政府制度和关系的一些问题时说，他不想来争辩谁的政府更有代表性，谁的制度更民主。他说，您想把我拖入关于你们政府的辩论。但是我认为，我不应卷到这件事里去，因为这是你们的政府，让美国人民来评判你们的政府吧。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府是世界上最爱好和平的政府。您说，美国人民也是爱好和平的，这点我相信您。您又说，因此美国政府也是爱好和平的，那么，我也对您提出这方面的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫接着叙述了他去年在美国同美国总统举行的会谈，他说，我同他谈得很好。我回到本国后向自己的人民汇报说，我们正在形成一些有可能同美国建立良好关系的条件。而这正是我们的人、苏联政府和全体人民的理想。因为，如果美国同我们之间有良好关系，那就有了和平，和平将存在于我们之间和整个世界上。赫鲁晓夫说，美国政府在这以后干了些什么呢？当我们在巴黎会面以前，美国政府派了“U—2型”间谍飞机侵入苏联国境。后来第二次又派了“RB—47型”侦察机来。难道这样干能够友好吗。他说，派遣侵略飞机是无助于改进我们的关系的，是无助于和平事业的，而且相反，会煽动狂热，加紧关系。如果将来还要进行这种飞行，那就可能导致战争。
    萨斯凯因德要求赫鲁晓夫最好是埋葬“U—2型”飞机事件，不要再把它抬出来，并且对“RB—47型”飞机事件同意美国政府要求的那种国际仲裁。
    赫鲁晓夫说，任何关系不论已变得多么尖锐，都会随着时间而失去其尖锐性。但是“U—2型”飞机不是死马。如果美国间谍飞机将来飞到苏联来，我们将把它们击落，从而可能爆发战争。在美国总统说他已取消了飞行以后，“RB—47型”飞机飞来了，这与其说是取消了飞行，不如说在重演飞行事件。美国军事机构或间谍机构还曾准备在我动身到联大出席会议前又派一架间谍飞机到我们那里去。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国政府要求苏联同意对“RB—47型”飞机的国际仲裁。这一点苏联不接受。在这件事情上最好的仲裁只有一个，那就是不要互相派遣间谍飞机。为什么需要这样作。让我们友好吧，让我们不要再互相损害吧，不要侵犯别国的主权吧。
    萨斯凯因德向赫鲁晓夫提出一个问题，问他是否同意美国政府在联合国大会上提出的在各国举行所谓“公民投票”以确定他们希望什么社会制度的建议。赫鲁晓夫回答说，看来，您不大了解历史。当十月革命完成后，美国、英国、法国、德国和日本派军队开入我国。他们把国内战争和武装干涉强加于我们头上。这是对我国各族人民希望有何种制度的全民测验。
    他说，我们打了仗，也就是说，进行了民意测验，打了四年。苏联的各族人民拿起了笤箒，把所有的武装干涉者——美国人、英国人、法国人和德国人扫到大海里去了。
    他说，如果有人想把这种调查强加于苏联，我们将不规避它。我们将加以清扫！我们的土地是神圣的，是不可侵犯的。我们不干涉你们的事务。你们想怎么生活，就怎么生活。但是，不要干涉我们的事务。我们将按照我们的意愿生活。为什么把你们的鼻子伸进我们的菜园。谁请你们的？你们美国自己的事情还少吗？
    赫鲁晓夫对美国干涉他国内政的严正谴责使萨斯凯因德恼羞成怒，他竟用“吠月”这种字眼来对待赫鲁晓夫。赫鲁晓夫打断他的话说：当您跟人谈话的时候，使用“吠月”这样的字眼，在你们这里难道认为是正常的吗？在我们那里，这被认为是不礼貌的。我给您当父亲都是够格的，您怎么对我这般放肆，年轻人。看您的外表倒不错，可是您的谈吐却不大礼貌。我不能容忍对我采取这种态度。我来这里不是为了狂吠。我是世界上最伟大的社会主义国家的部长会议主席。您对我得尊重，如果不愿意这么行动，那就别请人来谈话。必须有礼貌。也许您习惯于对什么人都哼哼几声。可是，我们可是一个受不得气的国家。
    在回答关于苏联改组联合国的建议的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，如果联合国跟着美国亦步亦趋，像它现在解决问题的方式那样片面地解决问题，那它就会在需要解决什么问题的各国和各国人民面前丧失他们对它的尊重和信任。在这种情况下，各国人民就将不去求助于联合国，而将努力自己解决这样的问题。他说，如果有人想在联合国使我们苏联遭到屈辱，处于从属地位，那么，我们没有联合国也过得了日子，正像我国曾经过了许多世纪一样。这就是说，如果有什么国家侵犯我们的主权，触动我们的利益，我们就将用本国的力量捍卫这些利益。即使以战争威胁我们，我们也不怕。我们将坚决捍卫我们国家的独立、我们的伟大成果。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联并不为自己求得什么特权；我们希望的是，在联合国，社会主义国家、参加美国集团的国家和中立国家，一律平等。这才是公正的。如果连这一点也不加考虑，那么，不仅我们，而且其他国家都将不再尊重联合国，于是联合国就会停止生存，渐趋死亡。
    谈到德国和西柏林问题，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联希望同两个德国缔结和约。战争结束以后，即将满十六年了，可是还没有和约。凡是希望战后局势正常化的人，都将达到这样一个结论：必须缔结对德和约。同两个德国缔结和约（显然，别的出路是没有的），也就可以解决西柏林占领制度问题。他说，我们认为这是合乎规律的：西柏林有自己的社会制度——那里存在着资本主义制度。我们不想干预西柏林的内务。让它的居民像现在那样生活在资本主义制度下吧，让他们有自己的自治机构吧；让西柏林同它愿意保持联系的一切国家保持联系吧，但是，西柏林占领制度必须取消。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到美国对联合国的控制时说，在联合国中，那些在政治上和经济上依赖美国的国家的代表遭到压力。但是，这种压力很快就要到末日了。这样的时刻将会到来：人民摆脱美国的影响，那时，美国在联合国中将成为少数。
    （赫鲁晓夫的这个回答说完以后是片刻的休息。在电视机的银幕上出现了新闻简报，号召听“自由欧洲”广播电台的恶毒的广播。有人把这种挑衅的事实报告了赫鲁晓夫。赫鲁晓夫对萨斯凯因德说，有人告诉我，在休息的时候，这条线路上转播了种种反苏谰言。你们为什么干这种事？你们害怕共产主义，害怕真理！没有关系，就叫他们转播吧。我们不怕这个，我们只会变得更加巩固。）
    休息后，萨斯凯因德企图提出一连串事先准备好的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫打断他的话说：——您要求我回答要简单，可是您自己却整套地阐述你的纲领。这样我就得回答到明天早晨。我看您是想使我处于这样一种境地：即提出问题，而不叫我回答问题。您想把所有问题都念完，然后说，谈话完毕。这样做是不行的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着回答了苏联代表团在联合国的活动的目的的问题，他说，我们的主要的愿望，苏联政府和苏联人民的愿望，就是同各国和平友好相处。我们也很希望看到美国人民和美国政府也有这种愿望。我认为，迟早会出现一种我们友好相处的局面，因为友谊将使我们有可能发展自己的经济和文化。而战争则带来灾难，因此我们主张和平，我们主张友谊。让我们的地球永远充满着和平，永远没有战争。他说，我干么要战争呢。我有很多孙子，甚至重孙都已经有了。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，苏联已把一项宣言提交联合国大会讨论，建议消灭殖民主义制度。他说，现在还有许多殖民地，那里的人们仍然遭受殖民主义奴役的痛苦。把他们也解放了吧。我们主张每一国人民都有完全的自由。譬如说，在我们那里，十五个独立的加盟共和国中的每一个，如果它愿意的话，都可以退出苏联，它有这样做的权利。
    谈到裁军问题，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联准备在关于裁军和销毁武器的条约上签字，而对销毁武器和裁军的监督，以及这种监督的制度，让美国去建议吧。他们提出什么建议，我们就接受什么建议，因为我们主张真正的监督，这符合我们的共同利益。但是美国总统所谈的不是裁军，而只是对军备的监督。我们赞同监督，也赞同调查。但是监督什么呢？因为如果没有裁军，就没有可以监督的东西。
    赫鲁晓夫说：我们什么军备也不想保存。我们希望取消一切军备。我们的目的是不保持武器，在国与国之间不发生战争。而您是想销毁一部分武器，还保留一部分。为什么要保留一部分呢？显然，是为了战争。他说，苏联准备实现裁军，这是主要的。苏联任何时候也不会同意没有裁军的调查和监督，因为这是间谍活动。
    赫鲁晓夫同意萨斯凯因德这样的说法：当某两个政治概念发生冲突并在很多问题上不能达成协议时，那么，双方应该表现出进行谈判和达成某些建设性的决定的愿望，因为双方都认为，战争是不可思议的。赫鲁晓夫还认为，在这种情况下谈判是唯一的途径。赫鲁晓夫说，我们有着不同的哲学。你们有资产阶级的哲学，而我们的哲学是共产主义的。在这个问题上我们达不成协议，我们也没有必要企图在这方面达成协议。观点和哲学概念上的分歧不应该导致我们两国之间的战争。而应该共处。他说，我们希望有和平。你们在资本主义的基础上发展自己的经济和管理自己的国家吧。我们不会干涉你们的内政，你们也不要干涉我们的内政。
    谈到关于建立对非洲国家禁运武器的制度的问题，
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们早就建议这样做。我们曾建议缔结条约，使任何一个国家也不能把武器卖给另一些国家。但是，美国政府没有采纳我们的建议。他说，让我们来签订这样的协定吧。我们希望和平，不希望战争，我们将尽一切力量来巩固和平。他说，为什么把武器给这些新的国家呢？它们需要粮食，需要发展本国经济的机器。它们不需要武器。如果谁也不干涉它们的内政的话，它们本身是不会拿起武器的。
    萨斯凯因德最后问赫鲁晓夫，他是否准备出席有美国未来的总统参加的最高级会议？
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，不仅愿意，而且我认为，我们一定要会晤。他说，我们愿意采取一切明智的步骤，来改善我们两国之间的关系，建立和平和友谊。他说，我们愿意会晤，愿意进行适当的会谈，愿意签订保障我们两国之间的和平和各国人民之间的友谊的这种协定。
