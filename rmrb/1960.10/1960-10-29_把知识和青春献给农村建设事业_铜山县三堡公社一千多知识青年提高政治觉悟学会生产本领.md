Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: In Sanbao People's Commune, Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, over one thousand educated youths have participated in agricultural production over the years, including high school, junior high school students, and higher primary school graduates. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, and through long-term agricultural production practice, they have further enhanced their political awareness and cultural level, learned many agricultural production skills, and made contributions to promoting agricultural production, developing rural culture, and strengthening the construction of rural people's communes.

	Before liberation, the people of Sanbao Commune lived in poverty, and very few people attended school. Many farming families had no one attending school for generations. After liberation, with the development of agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives, the vast majority of farmers' children attended school. After mastering a certain amount of cultural knowledge, many farmers' children actively responded to the Party's call to participate in agricultural labor, determined to build their hometowns even better. Wang Cuiping, once called a "silly girl" by a few people, graduated from higher primary school in 1955. At that time, her father was a district head, and her brother was in charge of a middle school. Many people thought she would go on to higher education or find a job. However, she saw the great prospects of agricultural cooperation and realized that the countryside urgently needed educated young people, so she resolutely participated in agricultural production. Over the years, she has worked actively and has been named a model commune member more than ten times. Last spring, she was elected as the production team leader, and the masses love her very much. Knowledgeable young people like Wang Cuiping, who are content with agricultural production, can be found in every brigade throughout the commune. During this year's summer vacation, more than one hundred and seventy educated youths in the whole commune responded to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and participated in labor on the front line of agricultural production.

	Over the years, the educated youths of Sanbao Commune, together with the broad masses, have fought against the poor mountains and rivers, promoting the development of agricultural production. During the drought this summer and autumn, Teng Shaoren, an educated youth from Tengzhai Brigade, led the masses to draw water to irrigate the fields day and night. After the water source dried up, he spent several days and nights looking for water sources, even staying on the mountain. He dug down wherever he found grass that wasn't withered, and in just over ten days, he found and excavated more than twenty mountain springs, bringing a bumper harvest to more than two hundred acres of land on the hillside. This higher primary school graduate from the year of liberation has now become the universally praised Party branch secretary of the brigade. The "Youth Flying Tigers Team," composed of fifteen educated youths from Wanglou Brigade, excels in everything in production and actively responds to the Party's call in all aspects.

	Over the years, the educated youths of this commune have widely carried out scientific and technological activities, and have taken various measures to help commune members improve their cultural level. Each brigade has various kinds of youth experimental fields. The experimental field of Jiacun Production Team in Wanglou Brigade, led by educated youth Deng Jiwen, has cultivated a multi-spike sorghum suitable for the local soil, which has begun to be promoted throughout the commune. This spring, Deng Jiwen and others started from scratch and founded a chemical fertilizer factory, which has now become a factory producing three thousand catties of local chemical fertilizer daily. Yan Hongwu, a higher primary school graduate, installed local tap water for the canteen and also created a local weeding tool with the commune members, increasing work efficiency by 30%. Teng Daowu, a higher primary school graduate from Youfang Production Team, recently created a double-knife slicer, which has been promoted throughout the commune, increasing the efficiency of slicing sweet potatoes by more than 50%. More than fifty female educated youths throughout the commune have served as health workers, and many educated youths have become water conservancy workers and various agricultural technicians. Most of the teachers in the commune's one hundred and sixty-plus mass spare-time study groups are educated youths. Now, 90% of the young and middle-aged illiterates in the whole commune have shed their illiterate status.

	Because the educated youths of the entire commune work actively and diligently, and listen to the Party's words in various movements, more than eight hundred people have been rated as model commune members, more than one hundred and fifty people have honorably joined the Communist Party, more than six hundred people have joined the Communist Youth League, more than three hundred people have served as production team leaders, accountants, and custodians, and six people have been elected as Party branch secretaries of the brigades. The commune Party committee also cares for and loves them very much. The spare-time Party school and Youth League school organized by the Party committee (two to three times a year) always try to absorb them to participate in learning, and at the same time pay attention to organizing them to carry out spare-time cultural learning to further improve their cultural level. Now, 70% of the higher primary school graduates in the whole commune have improved to junior high school level, and the cultural level of educated youths with junior high school and high school levels has also been greatly improved.

    把知识和青春献给农村建设事业
    铜山县三堡公社一千多知识青年提高政治觉悟学会生产本领
    据新华社南京27日电　江苏省铜山县三堡人民公社历年来参加农业生产的知识青年已经超过一千人，其中有高中、初中的学生和高小毕业生。他们在党的培养、教育下，在长期的农业生产实践中，进一步提高了政治觉悟和文化水平，学会了许多农业生产本领，为推进农业生产、发展农村文化、加强农村人民公社的建设作出了贡献。
    三堡公社解放前人民生活贫困，读书的人极少，许多农家几辈子没有人上学。解放后，随着农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，绝大部分农家子弟都上了学。许多农家子弟掌握了一定的文化知识后，积极响应党的号召，参加农业劳动，决心把家乡建设得更加美好。曾被少数人称为“傻姑娘”的王萃苹，是1955年高小毕业的。当时她父亲是区长，哥哥是一个中学的负责人，不少人认为她将升学或找工作。但是她看到了农业合作化的远大前途，认识到农村迫切需要有文化的青年人，便毅然参加了农业生产。几年来她积极劳动，曾十多次被评为模范社员，去年春天又被选为生产小队长，群众对他非常爱戴。像王萃苹这样安心农业生产的知识青年，全公社各大队都有。今年暑期全社又有一百七十多个知识青年，响应党大办农业、大办粮食的号召，参加了农业生产第一线的劳动。
    三堡公社参加农业生产的知识青年，几年来和广大群众一起与穷山恶水搏斗，推动了农业生产的发展。今年夏秋干旱时，滕寨大队的知识青年滕绍仁带领群众日夜引水灌田，水源干涸后，他为了找水源，曾几天几夜不下山，发现没有枯黄的草就往下挖，十几天就找出和挖掘出二十多个山泉，使山坡上二百多亩地获得了丰收。这个解放那年毕业的高小学生，现在已经成为人人称赞的大队党支部书记。王楼大队由十五个知识青年组成的“青年飞虎队”，在生产上样样干得出色，在各个方面都积极响应党的号召。
    这个公社的知识青年几年来广泛开展了科学技术活动，并且采取各种办法帮助社员提高文化水平。各个大队都有各式各样的青年试验田。王楼大队贾村生产队以知识青年邓继文为主的试验场，培育出一种适合当地土质的多穗高粱，已经开始在全社推广。今年春天邓继文等又白手起家，创办了一个化肥工厂，现在已经成为日产三千斤土化肥的工厂。高小毕业生阎鸿武为食堂安装了土自来水，还和社员一起创制出一种土耘草器，提高工效30％。油坊生产队高小毕业生滕道武最近创造了一种双刀切片器，在全社推广后，切山芋的工效提高了50％以上。全公社有五十多个女知识青年担任了保健员，许多知识青年成为水利员和各种农业技术员。全社的一百六十多个群众业余学习组，绝大部分教师都是知识青年。现在全社90％的青壮年文盲已经脱掉文盲帽子。
    全社知识青年由于积极劳动，埋头苦干，在各项运动中听党的话，目前已有八百多人被评为模范社员，有一百五十多人光荣地加入了共产党，六百多人加入了共青团，有三百多人担任了生产队长和会计、保管员等职务，有六人被选为大队的党支部书记。公社党委对他们也非常关怀和爱护。党委举办的业余党校和团校（每年二次到三次）总是尽可能吸收他们参加学习，同时也很注意组织他们开展业余文化学习，进一步提高文化水平。现在，全公社高小毕业生已有70％提高到初中程度，初中和高中水平的知识青年，文化水平也有了不少提高。
