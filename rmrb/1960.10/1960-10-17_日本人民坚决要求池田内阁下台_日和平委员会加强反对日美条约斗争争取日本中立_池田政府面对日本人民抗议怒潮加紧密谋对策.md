Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: The tide of anger among the Japanese people protesting the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' murder of Asanuma and demanding the Ikeda cabinet step down is surging in various places.

According to a report in today's "Akahata," more than 4,000 workers and citizens in Fukuoka City in southern Japan held a rally in front of the City Hall building on the afternoon of the 13th, demanding severe punishment for the murderer, dismissal of police officials, dissolution of fascist groups, and resolutely demanding the Ikeda cabinet resign en masse to take responsibility.

Four thousand workers, farmers, students, and citizens in Niigata City also held a large-scale rally on the afternoon of the 13th, strongly protesting the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' murder of Asanuma. The rally was jointly organized by the prefectural organizations of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the Niigata Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace, the Niigata Prefecture Council of Trade Unions, the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, and other organizations.

Komagome Kokichi, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party's Niigata Prefectural Committee, spoke at the meeting, calling on those present to strengthen the struggle against the true perpetrators of Asanuma's murder—the U.S.-Japan reactionaries—and to establish a strong united front to force the Ikeda cabinet to step down.

On the 13th, 1,000 workers in Mihara City, Hiroshima Prefecture, also held a protest rally. Seven hundred municipal government employees in Yawata City held a rally in the workplace in the morning, protesting the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' bloody atrocities. The Mie Prefecture People's Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" also held a protest rally in Tsu City, attended by representatives of 2,000 mass organizations, and passed a protest letter.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: The Japanese Peace Committee held a national council meeting in Tokyo today and unanimously adopted the current movement's policy: focusing on striving for Japan's neutralization and striving to establish a democratic and neutral government that opposes the "Security Treaty" and opposes the revival of militarism.

The current movement policy stipulates that in order to strive for Japan's neutralization and crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it is currently necessary to focus on launching struggles against U.S. military bases and strengthening solidarity with the people of Asia and Africa. The policy stipulates that movements will be launched in factories, mines, and rural areas; efforts will be strengthened to dispatch investigation teams to Okinawa to conduct investigations; support will be strengthened for the struggle of Niijima residents against the establishment of missile bases; the exchange of experiences in the struggle against U.S. military bases in various places will be strengthened; and exchanges of various kinds between the people of Japan and China will be strengthened to consolidate the friendship between the two peoples.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution, expressing grief and strongly protesting the fascist thugs' atrocities in murdering Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma.

The resolution pointed out that the murder of Asanuma is a provocation against the Japanese people who urgently demand independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. The resolution firmly stated that they will respond to the enemy's provocation by further strengthening the patriotic and just struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: The Japanese Ikeda government is plotting to use the name of "eliminating all violence" to intensify the suppression of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle for independence, peace, and democracy on the eve of the general election.

According to reports, the Japanese cabinet held a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss countermeasures on how to suppress the Japanese people who have been angered by the assassination of Asanuma by fascist thugs.

Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda, in a statement after the meeting, said with ulterior motives: Regarding "violence," "whether it is left or right, individuals or groups, it must be resolutely eliminated." The newly appointed Public Safety Commission Chairman, Shuto Hideo, also deliberately confused black and white in his inaugural speech yesterday, declaring: "Whether it is right or left, all violence must be eliminated."

Indications show that the Ikeda cabinet's suppression of "right-wing violence" is a sham, and suppressing the people's struggle is the reality. Right-wing violence groups have always been tools of the Japanese government and ruling party to undermine the people's movement and thugs who persecute progressives. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" said: The Liberal Democratic Party has close ties with right-wing violence groups, providing them with large amounts of funds to help carry out sabotage activities. Whenever Liberal Democratic Party cadres and Diet members hold lectures and go outside, they are accompanied by right-wing thugs as "bodyguards."

    日本人民坚决要求池田内阁下台
    日和平委员会加强反对日美条约斗争争取日本中立
    池田政府面对日本人民抗议怒潮加紧密谋对策
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本人民抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼、要求池田内阁下台的怒潮，正在各地汹涌澎湃地发展。
    据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本南部的福冈市工人和市民四千多人13日下午在市政府大厦前面广场举行大会，要求严惩凶犯，罢免警察负责人，解散法西斯团体，并坚决要求池田内阁引咎全体辞职。
    新潟市四千名工人、农民、学生和市民也在13日下午举行声势浩大的集会，强烈抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼。大会是由社会党和共产党的县组织、新潟县维护和平共同斗争会议、新潟县工会协议会、全日本农民协会联合会等组织联合举行的。
    日共新潟县委员会委员长挣口幸吉在会上讲话，号召与会者加强针对杀害浅沼的真正犯人——美日反动派的斗争，并建立强大的统一战线来迫使池田内阁下台。
    13日，还有广岛县三原市一千名工人举行了抗议大会。八幡市的市政府职员七百人上午在工作场所举行大会，抗议美日反动派的血腥暴行。三重县民阻止修改“安全条约”会议也在津市举行了有两千名群众团体代表参加的抗议大会，并且通过了一项抗议书。
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会今天在东京举行全国理事会会议，一致通过了当前的运动方针是：着重争取日本中立化和争取建立反对“安全条约”、反对复活军国主义的民主中立政府。
    当前运动方针规定，为了争取日本中立化和粉碎日美“安全条约”，当前必须着重展开反对美军基地的斗争和加强同亚非人民的团结。方针规定，将在工厂、矿山和农村展开运动，加强派遣调查团前往冲绳进行调查；加强支援新岛居民反对设立导弹基地的斗争，加强交流各地反对美军基地斗争的经验；加强日中两国人民间的往来和各种交流来巩固两国人民的友谊。
    会议一致通过决议，悲愤地强烈抗议法西斯暴徒杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的暴行。
    决议指出，杀害浅沼是对迫切要求独立、和平、民主和中立的日本人民的挑衅。决议坚决表示，他们将以进一步加强爱国正义斗争来答复敌人的这种挑衅。
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府阴谋假借“排除一切暴力”的名义，在大选前夕加紧镇压日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的反美爱国斗争。
    据报道，日本内阁13日下午举行会议，讨论如何镇压被法西斯暴徒暗杀浅沼的暴行激怒了的日本人民的对策。
    日本首相池田在会后发表谈话时，别有用心地说：对于“暴力”，“不管是左或是右，个人或集团，都必须坚决加以排除”。昨天新上任的公安委员长周东英雄在就任谈话中也故意混淆黑白地宣称：“不管是右或是左，一切的暴力都要加以排除”。
    迹象表明，池田内阁取缔“右翼暴力”是虚，镇压人民斗争是实。右翼暴力团体一向是日本政府和执政党破坏人民运动的工具，迫害进步人士的打手。日本资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”说：自由民主党同右翼暴力团体有着密切关系，他们向这些团体提供大量资金，帮助进行破坏活动。每当自由民主党的干部和议员举行演讲会和到外面时，他们身旁都有右翼暴徒作“保镖”。
