Xinhua News Agency, 18th, Belgrade: The so-called "entertainment" newspapers in Yugoslavia are filled with obscene and thieving yellow journalism and pictures that promote Western "civilization," becoming tools for poisoning young people. The weekly "Komunist," the central organ of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, recently had to admit these facts. The "Komunist" weekly acknowledged in an article on October 13 that "low tastes are seeping into" Yugoslav newspapers. These newspapers "often copy various shady stories catering to the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie from foreign (Editor's note: refers to Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France) pictorials," giving "a large amount of space to materials from the worst foreign newspapers and magazines: criminal cases, abnormal adventures of those eager to become Hollywood stars, all kinds of 'successful' acts of violence, vulgar and insulting discussions about young people's sexual behavior, espionage scandals, etc." Some Yugoslav newspapers have degenerated to an unprecedented level, even openly discussing "how to fake a hymen" in the newspapers. These disgusting discussions, even the "Komunist" weekly had to admit, "Even the bad newspapers before the war, due to following certain norms of petty-bourgeois morality, did not allow the use of this method."

This weekly revealed that in order to pursue an increase in circulation and thus obtain "huge profits," Yugoslav yellow newspapers use "commercial means" at any cost, competing to promote the "American way of life."

As the mouthpiece of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, after confessing these phenomena of social morality decline, the "Komunist" weekly pretended to "care" for "young readers" and "condemned" these newspapers for spreading "spiritual emptiness" and "insulting personality." However, this weekly avoided talking about the true political and social roots of this phenomenon, as well as the responsibility that the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group should bear for this. Instead, it attributed this phenomenon to "weakened social supervision," and even said that "in addition to the editorial department itself, most of the responsibility should be borne by the publishing committees and workers' committees of news enterprises."

    修正主义报刊充满资本主义毒素
    南斯拉夫一些报刊宣扬色情毒害青年
    新华社18日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫所谓“娱乐性”的报刊充斥着宣扬西方“文明”的晦淫晦盗的黄色新闻和图片，成为毒害青年的工具。最近出版的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央机关刊物“共产主义者”周报也不得不承认这些事实。“共产主义者”周报在10月13日的文章中承认，“低级趣味正在渗入”南斯拉夫报刊。这些报刊“往往从外国（新华社编者按：指美、英、法等西方国家）画报上抄袭各种迎合小市民口味的黑幕”，把“大量篇幅让给最坏的外国报纸杂志上的材料：犯罪案件、渴求当好莱坞明星的反常冒险行动、各种各样的‘成功’的暴行、关于青年性生活行为的下流的、令人感到侮辱的讨论、间谍黑幕等”。南斯拉夫一些报刊已堕落到无以复加的地步，竟然在报上公开谈论“如何造假处女膜问题”。这些令人作呕的谈论，连“共产主义者”周报也不得不承认：“甚至战前的坏报刊由于遵循小市民道德的某些准则也未容许采用这种方式。”
    这家周刊透露，南斯拉夫黄色报刊为了追求增加发行份数，从而获取“暴利”，不惜任何代价地运用“商业手腕”，竞相宣传“美国生活方式”。
    作为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央的喉舌，“共产主义者”周报在供认这些社会道德沦落的现象之后，装出一副“爱护”“年轻的读者”的样子，还“谴责”这些报刊散布“精神空虚”和“侮辱人格”。但是，这家周报避而不谈造成这种现象的真正政治、社会根源，以及南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团对此所应担负的责任。它却把这种现象归之于“社会监督削弱了”，甚至说什么“除了编辑部本身以外，大部分责任要由新闻企业的出版委员会和工人委员会担负”。
