    Our Common Wish
    Han En, National Model Agricultural Laborer, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of Xingfu Zhi Lu (Road to Happiness) Commune
    I remember, it was in 1954 when Comrade Meng Tai, a national model industrial worker, led a delegation to visit our commune. Workers and peasants met like close brothers, overjoyed. I had a long talk with Comrade Meng Tai all night long. At that time, we had a common wish: to use advanced industrial technology to support the development of agricultural production, and agriculture, in turn, should vigorously promote industrial growth.
    Since the people's communes were established, our agricultural production has received more support from industry, and our agricultural production has continuously achieved great leaps forward. Last winter, the three major chemical plants in Jilin City took the initiative to "link up" with our commune. The worker elder brothers enthusiastically supported us with machine tools, electric motors, transformers, and other industrial equipment, and also sent four technical workers to help us establish a pine resin oil factory and a timber processing factory. Now our agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant can manufacture new agricultural implements such as rice threshers, weeding hoes, and western plows, equipping our agriculture technologically and promoting the technical transformation of agriculture. As a result, we have planted more than 1,400 mu of land this year in our commune. Jilin Chemical Industrial Company also supported us with 60,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, which increased the production of more than 300,000 jin of grain on more than 4,500 mu of paddy fields. This year, we have also added five tractors and many rice transplanters. Industry's strengthening of technical support for agriculture has truly brought the alliance between workers and peasants into a new stage.
    All our commune members, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of industrial technology, will better promote the technical transformation of agriculture. We must strive to be strong and implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the commune, and carry out a vigorous and down-to-earth production increase and economizing movement centered on increasing grain production. While vigorously striving to harvest more grain this autumn, we must earnestly prepare for more grain production next year, to vigorously promote the development of our socialist industry.

    我们共同的愿望
    全国农业劳动模范幸福之路公社党委书记、社长  韩恩
    记得，那是1954年，全国工业劳动模范孟泰同志，率领一个代表团到我们社里来访问。工人农民像亲兄弟一般欢天喜地的相会。我和孟泰同志畅谈了一个通宵。那时，我们就有一个共同的愿望：要用先进的工业技术来支援农业生产的发展，农业又要大力促进工业的增长。
    人民公社化以后，我们的农业生产得到工业方面更多的支援，我们的农业生产也连续地实现了大跃进。去年冬天，吉林市三大化工厂主动同我们公社来“挂钩”。工人老大哥热情地支援我们机床、电动机、变压器以及其他工业器材，而且派了四个技术工人，帮助我们建立了松根油厂和木材加工厂。现在我们的农业机械修造厂能够制造打稻机、耘锄、洋犁等新式农具，从技术上装备了我们的农业，推进了农业的技术改造。因此，今年我们公社多种了一千四百多亩土地。吉林化学工业公司还支援了我们六万斤化肥，使四千五百多亩水田增产三十多万斤粮食。今年，我们又增添了五台拖拉机和不少插秧机。工业对农业加强技术支援，真使工农之间的联盟进入了一个新的阶段。
    我们全体社员，要在党的领导下，在工业技术的援助下，更好地推进农业技术的改造，我们要发愤图强，贯彻勤俭办社的精神，开展以增产粮食为中心的轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实的增产节约运动。在大力争取今年秋收多收粮食的同时，切实准备明年更多的增产粮食，来大力促进我们社会主义工业的发展。
