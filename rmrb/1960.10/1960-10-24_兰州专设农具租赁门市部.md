Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram: The Lanzhou Municipal Civil Equipment Company's agricultural machinery and production materials wholesale store in Gansu Province has launched an agricultural machinery and tool rental business to make the best use of materials and effectively support production.

This rental business was developed to meet the needs of Lanzhou's government agencies, factories, mines, and schools that have set up their own farms, vegetable gardens, and other production bases, and a specialized agricultural tool and machinery rental department has been established. In just over a month, twenty-five factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, and schools in the city have rented a total of 285 iron hoes, picks, and sprayers in eight varieties from the department.

The development of the agricultural machinery rental business can first of all improve the utilization rate of tools and give full play to the effectiveness of the tools. Since the time when various units use various agricultural machinery and tools is different, the commercial department can reasonably arrange the use time according to the specific situation of each unit, increasing the number of times agricultural tools are used. For example, in late August, the thirty mu of potatoes and vegetable plots planted by the Lanzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce's Political Training Class were infested with pests and urgently needed a batch of sprayers. They rented nine units from the rental department at one time, and used them for three days to eliminate the pests and ensure a bumper harvest. Subsequently, this batch of sprayers was continuously rented to five units, including the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory. If these units all purchased sprayers themselves, not only would the quantity be much larger, but also because the number of uses throughout the year would be small, most of the time they would be idle, which would cause waste of materials.

Secondly, the rental fee for agricultural machinery and tools is low, which can enable various units to save expenses and implement the principle of diligence and frugality. For example, renting a sprayer costs only 5 jiao per day, while buying one costs 90 yuan.

### 兰州专设农具租赁门市部

    兰州专设农具租赁门市部
    新华社兰州电  甘肃省兰州市民用器材公司农业机械生产资料批发商店，开展农业机械、农具租赁业务，使物尽其用，有力地支援了生产。
    这种租赁业务，是适应兰州市的机关厂矿、学校纷纷自办农场、菜园和其他生产基地的需要而开展的，并且专设了农具、农业机械租赁门市部。一个多月来，全市有二十五个厂矿、企业、机关、学校，在门市部租赁了铁铣、镐头、喷雾器共八种、二百八十五件。
    开展农业机具租赁业务，首先可以提高工具利用率，充分发挥工具的效能。由于各单位使用各种农械、工具的时间不一，商业部门就可以根据各单位的具体情况，合理安排使用时间，增加农具使用次数。如8月下旬，兰州市工商联政治讲习班种的三十亩洋芋和菜地发生了虫害，急需一批喷雾器，到租赁门市部一次租了九部，使用三天，消灭了虫害，保证了丰收。随后，这批喷雾器又连续租给了兰州通用机器厂等五个单位使用。如果这些单位都自己购买喷雾器，不仅是数量要得多，而且由于全年使用次数少，大部分时间将闲置不用，会造成物资浪费。
    其次，农业机具的租费低廉，可以使各单位节省开支，贯彻勤俭节约的原则。如租赁一部喷雾器一天只付费五角，而买一部却要花费九十元。
