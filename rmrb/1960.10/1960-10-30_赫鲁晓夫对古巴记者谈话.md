Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: TASS Moscow, October 28th—Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev told Cuban journalists here that he was very satisfied with the relations that had been established between the Soviet Union and Cuba. Khrushchev went on to say that the Soviet people had watched with great sympathy the Cuban people's struggle against the imperialist lackey, the Batista dictatorship, and that the Soviet people greatly respected the Cuban people's leader, Castro, and his comrades-in-arms who were loyal to the people.

Khrushchev answered questions from the head of the delegation, "Revolución" editor, Franji, when he received a delegation of Cuban journalists on October 22nd.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Cuban people's leaders fully understood that only the people can be victorious in the tenacious struggle against imperialists and colonialists and for the establishment of a people's regime, a true people's regime.

The head of the Soviet government pointed out that he hoped his words about providing assistance to Cuba if it were subjected to armed aggression would "only be symbolic." Khrushchev said that to this end, it was necessary to prevent the imperialist threat to Cuba from turning into military action, and then there would be no need to confirm the reality of our words about armed assistance to the Cuban people against aggression.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that the Soviet people, all honest people, and the working people of the whole world sympathize with the Cuban people and the Cuban people's struggle for independence, freedom, and progress.

    赫鲁晓夫对古巴记者谈话
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科28讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在这里对古巴记者说，他对苏联和古巴之间已经建立的关系感到很满意。赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联人民曾经怀着极大的同情注视古巴人民反对帝国主义的仆从——巴蒂斯塔独裁者所进行的斗争，苏联人民很尊敬古巴人民的领袖卡斯特罗和他的忠实于人民的战友们。
    赫鲁晓夫10月22日接见古巴新闻工作者代表团时，回答了代表团团长、“革命报”社长弗兰吉提出的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，古巴人民的领导者十分了解，在反对帝国主义者和殖民主义者、争取建立人民政权、真正的人民政权的顽强斗争中，只有人民才能成为胜利者。
    苏联政府首脑指出，他希望，他的关于一旦古巴遭到武装侵略时就给它以援助的话“不过是象征性的”。赫鲁晓夫说，为此，必须使帝国主义干涉古巴的威胁不致变成军事行动，那时就没有必要来确证我们的关于武装援助古巴人民反对侵略的话的现实性。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联人民、所有正直的人和全世界劳动人民都同情古巴人民和古巴人民为争取独立、自由和进步而进行的斗争。
