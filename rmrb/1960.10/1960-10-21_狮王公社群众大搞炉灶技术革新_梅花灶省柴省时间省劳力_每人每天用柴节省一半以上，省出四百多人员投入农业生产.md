    Lion Commune Masses Vigorously Promote Stove Technology Innovation
    Plum Blossom Stove Saves Fuel, Time, and Labor
    Each Person Saves More Than Half of Daily Fuel Consumption, Freeing Up Over 400 People for Agricultural Production
    (Our Dispatch) According to the Sichuan Daily, the masses of the Lion Commune in Santai County are vigorously promoting stove technology innovation, achieving plum blossom stove implementation, achieving fuel saving, time saving, and labor saving, becoming a red banner for saving firewood in the county. Now 70% of the public canteens in the county have promoted this new type of stove.
    The Lion Commune has always been short of firewood. Every year in July and August, many people go out to collect firewood. In 1958, when the People's Commune was established and public canteens were set up, the commune cadres cared about the lives of the masses and attached great importance to the firewood problem. On the one hand, they led the masses to improve stove types (successively changed to row stoves, connected pot stoves, double stove door connected pot stoves) to save firewood; on the other hand, they planted plants like Rosa Roxburghii and Imperata cylindrica on the Hongpo bare rocks to increase firewood sources. In order to further solve the firewood problem, Luo Zonghe, the captain of the fifth production team of the fifth management district and a Communist Party member, with the strong support and encouragement of the Party organization, carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and boldly innovated the stove type on the original basis. After seven days of effort, he finally created the fuel-saving, time-saving, and labor-saving plum blossom stove. In order to give full play to the power of this stove, the Commune Party Committee also helped Hu Shaoxiu, the cook of the sixth production team's canteen, to summarize a set of advanced firewood-burning operation procedures, and universally promoted a series of firewood-saving experiences such as building a good stove type, managing fuel well, and mastering firewood-burning technology throughout the commune, reducing firewood consumption from the original 2.5 jin per person per day to fourteen liang (sixteen ounces to a jin), fundamentally changing the firewood shortage phenomenon. As of the end of September, in addition to meeting the needs of feed and firewood, this year's harvested crop stalks and weeds have also been used to provide more than 40,000 jin of straw for commune members to repair houses, and about 100,000 jin of straw has been taken out of the remaining 260,000 jin of straw for comprehensive utilization.
    The widespread use of plum blossom stoves in various public canteens has proven that it not only saves a lot of fuel, but also saves a lot of labor. Now the commune has withdrawn more than 300 firewood collectors and more than 100 cooks from the canteens to invest in agricultural production; it can save cooking time, shortening the time for each meal from the original two hours to less than one hour; and it is clean and hygienic, allowing commune members to eat hot meals and dishes three times a day, ensuring the supply of boiling water and hot water, and the kitchen is free of dust. At the same time, the stove modification technology is simple, requires little labor and materials, and is easy to promote. All forty-one public canteens in the commune achieved plum blossom stove implementation within seven days.
    In the process of promoting the plum blossom stove, the cadres of the Lion Commune actively invested in this work. Through on-site learning, more than 40 cadres learned the stove building technology, and trained a technical team of more than 30 stove builders. Fourteen of the forty-one plum blossom stoves in the commune were built by leading cadres themselves.
    With the promotion of the plum blossom stove, the entire commune has also implemented a system of regular payment, savings rewards, storage and weighing, and advanced management of firewood and grass in the canteen. The implementation of this system has also played a significant role in saving fuel.

    狮王公社群众大搞炉灶技术革新
    梅花灶省柴省时间省劳力
    每人每天用柴节省一半以上，省出四百多人员投入农业生产
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：中共三台县狮王公社群众大搞炉灶技术革新，实现梅花灶化，做到了省燃料、省时间、省劳力，成为全县节约用柴的红旗。现在全县70％的公共食堂推广了这种新型炉灶。
    狮王公社历来就缺乏柴烧。每年7、8月间，都有很多人出外拣柴。1958年人民公社成立，公共食堂成立，公社干部关心群众生活，非常重视烧柴问题。一方面领导群众改进灶型（先后改过排灶、连锅灶、双灶门连锅灶），节约用柴；一方面在红坡光岩上，栽种马桑、芭茅等，增加柴源。为了进一步解决烧柴问题，第五管理区第五生产队队长、共产党员罗宗和，在党组织的大力支持和鼓舞下，发扬敢想敢干精神，在原来基础上，又大胆进行灶型革新，经过七天努力，终于创造了省柴、省时间、省劳力的梅花灶。为了充分发挥这种灶的威力，公社党委又帮助第六生产队食堂炊事员胡少秀，总结出一套先进的烧柴操作规程，把打好灶型、管好燃料、掌握好烧柴技术一系列节约烧柴的经验，在全社普遍推广，使烧柴量由原来每人每天二点五斤降至十四两（十六进位），从根本上改变了缺柴现象。截至9月底，今年收获的作物秸秆和杂草，除满足饲料、用柴需要外，还拿出了四万多斤秸秆给社员修补房屋，又从剩余的二十六万多斤秸秆中，拿出十万斤左右大搞综合利用。
    各个公共食堂普遍使用梅花灶的实践证明，它不仅大量节省燃料，还能节省大量劳动力，现在全社已从食堂抽出三百多拣柴人员和一百多炊事人员投入农业生产；能节省煮饭时间，每煮一顿饭由原来的两小时多缩短为一小时以下；而且清洁卫生好，使社员一日三餐吃到热饭热菜，保证开水和热水供应，灶房无灰尘。同时改灶技术简单，用工用料不多，容易推广。全社四十一个公共食堂，七天内就实现了梅花灶化。
    在推广梅花灶的过程中，狮王公社的干部都积极投入这一工作。通过现场学习，四十多个干部学会了打灶技术，并培训了一支三十多人的打灶技术队伍。全社四十一个食堂的梅花灶，有十四个是由领导干部亲自动手打成的。
    随着梅花灶的推广，全公社还实行了定期支付，节约奖励，保管过秤，食堂储存的先进管理柴草的制度。这一制度的实行，对节约燃料也起了很大作用。
