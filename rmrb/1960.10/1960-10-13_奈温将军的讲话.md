Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. The full text of General Ne Win's speech at the farewell banquet hosted by Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province, is as follows:

    Respected host today, Governor, Respected Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, friends:
    The first thing I want to say is that I received a warm and grand welcome from the people of Guangzhou today, for which I express my special thanks. I also thank the Governor and all friends who arranged this warm and grand welcome.
    In spite of his busy schedule, the Governor not only arranged the warm and grand welcome I mentioned above, but also hosted a banquet for me this evening. I once again express my heartfelt thanks for this. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Marshal Chen Yi and his wife, who accompanied us all the way and provided us with meticulous hospitality.
    China and Myanmar have had a traditional friendship since ancient times. Since both countries were ruled by foreign powers, the traditional friendship between the two countries was once interrupted. However, since both countries achieved independence, the governments and peoples of China and Myanmar have made great efforts to restore Sino-Myanmar friendship. Here, I would like to especially mention Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai, who made great contributions to the restoration of friendship between the two countries. Through their efforts, not only was the friendship between China and Myanmar promoted, but it also led to the resolution of the border issue between the two countries.
    Now the edifice of Sino-Myanmar friendship has been completed. In order to ensure that the edifice of Sino-Myanmar friendship is never damaged, both our countries have a responsibility to maintain this edifice. I can assure you that Myanmar will do its utmost to maintain this edifice, and I also believe that China will also make efforts to maintain this edifice.
    The signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression between China and Myanmar and the Sino-Myanmar Boundary Treaty has not only greatly promoted the friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar, but has also set a good example. Finally, let me wish
    Good health to today's host, Governor, and all the friends present here,
    Eternal friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar,
    May the Chinese people have physical and mental well-being and happiness!
    Cheers!

    奈温将军的讲话
    新华社广州12日电　奈温将军在广东省省长陈郁举行的欢送宴会上的讲话，全文如下：今天的主人，省长阁下，外交部长陈毅元帅阁下，各位朋友们：
    我首先想讲的一点是今天我来到广州受到广州人民热烈而隆重的欢迎，对此我表示特别的感谢，同时也感谢安排这次热烈而隆重欢迎的省长和各位朋友们。
    在此百忙中，省长先生不仅安排了我上面所讲的热烈而隆重的欢迎，并且在晚上设宴招待我，对此我再一次表示衷心的感谢。我也想借此机会，感谢一路上陪我们前来，并对我们进行无微不至的招待的陈毅元帅和夫人。
    中缅两国自古以来就有了传统的友谊，自从两国被外国统治后，两国的传统友谊曾一度遭到中断。但是两国各自取得独立以后，中缅两国政府和两国人民为了恢复中缅友谊做了巨大的努力。在这里，我要特别提到为恢复两国友谊作了巨大贡献的吴努总理和周恩来总理。通过他们两位的努力，不仅促进了中缅两国的友谊，并且导致了两国边界问题的解决。
    现在中缅友好大厦已经落成，为了使中缅友好大厦永远不受损害，我们两国都有责任来维护这座大厦。我可以保证，缅甸方面一定要竭尽全力来维护这座大厦，同时我相信，中国方面也一定会努力来维护这座大厦。
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界条约的签订，不仅大大促进了中缅两国人民的友谊，同时也树立了良好的榜样。最后，让我祝
    今天的主人、省长阁下以及在座的各位朋友们的健康，
    中缅两国人民永恒的友谊，
    中国人民身心愉快和幸福
    干杯！
