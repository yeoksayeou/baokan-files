Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 4th: TASS reported from New York on the 4th that Ghana's President Nkrumah, India's Prime Minister Nehru, Indonesia's President Sukarno, the United Arab Republic's President Nasser, and Yugoslavia's President Tito wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, on September 29th, expressing the hope that their proposal at the United Nations General Assembly regarding the hope that the Soviet and American governments "resume recently interrupted contacts" would be sympathetically treated by the Soviet side. Khrushchev wrote identical letters to Nkrumah et al., explaining the Soviet government's views.

Khrushchev's reply stated that the Soviet government has consistently believed in the past and now believes that outstanding international issues, including Soviet-American relations, should and can be resolved peacefully through negotiations, as long as the parties concerned are sincere. The letter pointed out that the Soviet government, in this spirit, has consistently advocated that these issues must be discussed at the summit level.

The reply accused the United States government of taking aggressive actions on the eve of the summit meeting by using American "U-2" military aircraft to invade Soviet territory, and reiterated the aforementioned perfidious policy. The reply said that it is understandable that if the United States government continues to pursue the above-mentioned policy in the future, then under such circumstances, no country that respects itself, cares about its sovereignty not being violated, and cares about its security can believe the United States government's statements about hoping to improve Soviet-American relations. The same is true for the issue of disarmament. The United States' position on disarmament clearly undermines any effective disarmament negotiations, and its starting point is not based on the necessity of disarmament under strict international supervision, but on establishing supervision over armaments, that is, establishing an approved international espionage system under the banner of the United Nations.

The reply stated that we are willing to have contact and negotiations with the American president and government, as long as the American government has the courage to condemn the above-mentioned actions that led to the deterioration of Soviet-American relations and shows sincerity in improving these relations through practical actions.

    就苏联和美国政府的关系问题
    赫鲁晓夫复函五国政府首脑
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：加纳总统恩克鲁玛、印度总理尼赫鲁、印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔和南斯拉夫总统铁托9月29日曾经写了一封信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，表示希望他们在联合国大会提出的关于希望苏联和美国政府
  “恢复最近中断的接触”的提案能够得到苏联方面的同情的对待。赫鲁晓夫就这封信给恩克鲁玛等人写了内容相同的复信，阐明苏联政府的意见。
    赫鲁晓夫的复信说，苏联政府过去和现在一贯认为，悬而未决的国际问题、其中包括苏美关系问题应当而且能够用和平途径通过谈判来解决，只要有关方面对此有诚意。信中指出，苏联政府本着这种精神一贯主张必须在最高级会议上讨论这些问题。
    复信指责美国政府在最高级会议前夕采取美国“U—2型”军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的侵略行动，而且一再重申上述背信弃义的政策。复信说，可以理解，如果美国政府今后仍将奉行上述政策，那么在这种情况下，任何一个尊重自己、关心自己的主权不受侵犯、关心自己的安全的国家，都不能相信美国政府关于希望改善苏美关系的声明。对于裁军问题也完全如此，美国对裁军问题的立场明显地是破坏任何有成效的裁军谈判，其出发点不是基于在严格的国际监督下裁军的必要性，而在于对军备建立监督，即在联合国旗帜下建立被批准的国际间谍制度。
    复信说，我们愿意同美国总统和政府进行接触和谈判，只要美国政府有勇气谴责导致苏美关系恶化的上述行动，并表现出在实际行动中改善这种关系的诚意。
