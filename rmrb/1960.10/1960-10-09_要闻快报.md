News in Brief

Concentrated Operations: More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
The Dalizi Iron Mine in Tonghua, Jilin Province, implemented the policy of concentrated operations in mining, concentrating equipment and manpower from 27 scattered mining areas to 22 key mining areas since May. This effectively utilized manpower, equipment, time, space, and technological innovation results, leading to a continuous leap forward in the mine with high output, rapid excavation, high efficiency, low cost, and good safety. From May to August, the daily ore output increased by 66% compared to January to April; the output per unit area increased from 5.5 tons to 9.6 tons; the excavation speed per team increased from 50 meters per month to 72 meters; labor productivity increased by 43.9%; and the cost per ton of ore also decreased by 25%. Furthermore, due to the accelerated excavation speed, the mine's reserve of recoverable ore increased sharply from thirteen months to eighteen months, which not only ensured the overfulfillment of the state plan every month but also prepared sufficient "grain" for the continued leap forward next year.

Continuously Improve the Efficiency of Coal Loading Machines
The 18th Coal Mining Team of the Tenth Pit of the Xinqiu Coal Mine in Fuxin, Liaoning Province, insisted on using coal loading machines and continuously improved their efficiency, giving greater power to this major technological innovation in the production increase and economy drive. Now, the efficiency of this coal mining team's coal loading machine has increased from 8 tons per hour at the beginning of the year to 20 tons. Thanks to the widespread use of coal loading machines, this section has overfulfilled the coal production plan every month.

Longgang No. 1 Steel Plant Transforms In-Plant Transportation
The No. 1 Steel Plant of the Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei Province, with a spirit of continuous revolution, transformed the dedicated lines within the plant, vigorously promoted the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, as well as making operations run more smoothly. They also improved transportation management, promoted "four-eight staggered operations" among loading and unloading workers, and established and improved twelve new rules and regulations, including handover shifts, new technology operations, locomotive inspection, and line maintenance, completely changing the face of in-plant transportation. Now, the number of transport and handling personnel has been reduced by 32.5% compared to the past, and the number of trucks and horse-drawn carts used has also been reduced by more than two-thirds. However, the amount of in-plant transportation work has increased by 1.3 times compared to the past, increasing raw material reserves and powerfully promoting the continuous leap forward in iron and steel production.

Using Sintered Ore to Greatly Increase Blast Furnace Production
In order to ensure the continued leap forward in iron and steel production, Sichuan Province’s iron and steel enterprises, while focusing on increasing ore production and transportation, vigorously carried out powder ore washing, selection, and sintering, turning a large amount of previously discarded powder ore into sintered ore with high iron content. According to statistics up to the end of September, the province has utilized approximately 200,000 tons of powder ore, fully utilizing national resources, saving a large amount of transportation capacity, and adding a large amount of "refined grain" to blast furnace production, promoting high-quality and high-yield pig iron production.

Produce More Fuel Materials to Produce More Steel
In the production increase and economy drive, the Shanghai Coking Plant has tried every possible means to increase the utilization rate of raw coal, mobilizing the masses to use peat to produce coke, increasing coke production. Since the beginning of September, more than 5,600 tons of peat have been used to produce more than 3,250 tons of coke, supporting steel production.

The Shanghai Songjiang Lime Kiln Factory staff created the "continuous charging, continuous ash discharge" kiln burning method, which increased the daily output of lime by more than double compared to the past. Among them, lump lime that meets the requirements for steelmaking accounts for 96%, an increase of 30% compared to the past, and the coal consumption per ton of lime has also decreased.

    要闻快报
    集中作业多快好省
    吉林通化大栗子铁矿贯彻集中作业的采掘方针，从五月份起把全矿分散在二十七个采区的设备、人力集中使用于二十二个重点采区，有效地利用了人力、设备、时间、空间和技术革新成果，使全矿出现了产量大、掘进快、效率高、成本低、安全好的不断跃进局面。五至八月份的矿石日产量比一至四月份增长百分之六十六；单位面积产量由五点五吨提高到九点六吨；掘进速度每队由月进五十米提高到七十二米；劳动生产率提高百分之四十三点九；每吨矿石成本也降低了百分之二十五。并且由于掘进速度加快，全矿储备的回采矿量已由十三个月猛增到十八个月，不仅保证了月月超额完成国家计划，还为明年的持续跃进准备了充足的“粮食”。
    不断提高攉煤机效率
    辽宁阜新新丘煤矿十坑十八采煤队，坚持使用攉煤机，不断提高攉煤机的效率，使这项重大技术革新在增产节约运动中发挥了更大的威力。现在，这个采煤队的攉煤机效率已由年初每小时攉八吨提高到二十吨，这个段由于普遍采用了攉煤机，月月超额完成产煤计划。
    龙钢一厂改造厂内运输
    河北龙烟钢铁公司第一钢铁厂，以不断革命精神，改造厂内专用线路，大搞装卸机械化、半机械化和滑溜化，并改进了运输管理工作，在装卸工人中推行了“四八交叉作业”，建立和健全了交接班、新技术操作、机车检查、线路维护等十二项新的规章制度，彻底改变了厂内运输面貌。现在，运输装卸人员比过去减少了百分之三十二点五，占用的汽车、马车也减少了三分之二以上，但是厂内运输作业量较过去提高了一点三倍，增加了原料储备，有力地促进了钢铁生产持续跃进。
    利用烧结矿高炉大增产
    四川省钢铁企业为保证钢铁生产持续跃进，在狠抓矿石增产和调运的同时，大搞粉矿洗、选、烧结，使原来弃置未用的大量粉矿变成了含铁品位高的烧结矿。据到九月末的统计，全省已利用了粉矿约二十万吨，使国家资源得到充分的利用，节省了大量的运输力量，为高炉生产增加了大批“细粮”，促进了生铁优质高产。
    多产燃料材料多炼钢
    上海焦化厂在增产节约运动中，千方百计提高原煤的利用率，发动群众利用泥煤炼焦，增产焦炭。自九月初以来，已利用五千六百多吨泥煤炼出三千二百五十多吨焦炭，支援了炼钢生产。
    上海松江炼灰厂职工创造“连续加料、连续放灰”的烧窑法，使石灰的日产量比过去提高一倍多，其中符合炼钢要求的块灰占百分之九十六，比过去提高百分之三十，每吨石灰的耗煤量也有所下降。
