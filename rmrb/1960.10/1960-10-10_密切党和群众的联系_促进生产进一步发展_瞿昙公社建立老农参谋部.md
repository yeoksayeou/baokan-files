Strengthen the Ties Between the Party and the Masses, Promote Further Development of Production
Qutan Commune Establishes Old Peasant Advisory Department

    This newspaper reports that the Qutan Commune Party Committee in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, organized experienced old peasants from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to establish an Old Peasant Advisory Department, which has further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses and greatly promoted production.

    In order to enable cadres to go deeper into reality to conduct investigation and research, and to adhere to the "Four Togethernesses" work style, the Qutan Commune Party Committee called on each cadre to unite with at least three experienced old peasants as advisors. The commune, brigade, and production team hired experienced old peasants from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to establish "Old Peasant Advisory Departments." In addition to individual visits, commune cadres held old peasant symposiums once a month, brigade cadres every half month, and production team cadres every week. At the symposiums, they would both promote the Party's principles and policies and ask them to provide good experiences to improve production. In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the old peasants, all of their opinions were addressed and implemented. Those who made rational suggestions that significantly promoted production were rewarded.

    Since the establishment of the various Old Peasant Advisory Departments more than two months ago, they have put forward more than 120 rational suggestions, of which more than 80 have been adopted, greatly promoting the development of production. In late August, at an old peasant symposium held in the Qutan Brigade, seventy-three-year-old peasant Xu Dayuan put forward a series of opinions on plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and preparatory farming. Based on these opinions of the old peasants and the fact that the soil in the entire commune would soon freeze in late October, the Commune Party Committee immediately launched a production upsurge throughout the commune to seize the "Three Treasures" and win continued leaps forward in agriculture in 1961. During the autumn harvest season, the entire commune used more than 620 auxiliary laborers to engage in plowing, fertilizer accumulation, land leveling, and other preparatory farming activities. Guo Denghong, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, participated in harvesting in the Langying Production Team of the Qutan Brigade, taking advantage of the evening to visit old peasants individually or hold symposiums. Every opinion put forward by the old peasants was seriously dealt with, so every day, no fewer than a dozen commune members offered him suggestions and confided in him.

    密切党和群众的联系　促进生产进一步发展
    瞿昙公社建立老农参谋部
    本报讯　青海省乐都县瞿昙公社党委组织贫农、下中农中有经验的老农，成立老农参谋部，更加密切了党和群众的关系，对生产起了很大的促进作用。
    为了使干部更加深入实际做调查研究工作，坚持“四同”作风，瞿昙公社党委号召每个干部最少要团结三个有经验的老农当参谋。公社、大队、生产队聘请贫农和下中农中有经验的老农成立“老农参谋部”，除个别访问外，公社干部一个月、大队干部半个月、生产队一星期要分别召开一次老农座谈会。在座谈会上，一面宣传党的方针、政策；一面请他们提供好经验搞好生产。为了激发老农的积极性，对他们所提的意见，全都做到件件有交代，事事有着落。对促进生产有显著成效的合理化建议者，给予奖励。
    各老农参谋部成立两个多月以来，前后已提出一百二十多件合理化建议，其中有八十多件已被采用，大大促进了生产的发展。8月下旬，在瞿昙大队召开的一次老农座谈会上，七十三岁的老农徐大元对翻槎、积肥、备耕提出一系列的意见。公社党委根据老农的这些意见和全公社10月下旬土地即将结冻的情况，立即在全公社掀起了一个狠抓“三宝”，夺取1961年农业继续跃进的生产高潮。全公社在秋收时期，用六百二十多个辅助劳力大闹翻槎、积肥、平整土地等备耕活动。公社党委副书记郭登隆在瞿昙大队浪营生产队参加收割时，利用晚上时间个别拜访老农或开座谈会，对老农提出的每一条意见都是认真进行处理，所以每天给他献计献策、说知心话的社员总不下十多个。
