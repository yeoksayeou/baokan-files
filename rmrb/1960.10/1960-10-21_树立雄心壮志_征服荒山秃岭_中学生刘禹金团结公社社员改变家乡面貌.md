Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 20th: Liu Yujin, deputy leader of the Liziyuan Youth Shock Brigade of the Guzhou Commune in Rongjiang County, Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, and a member of the Communist Party, has been working selflessly and studying diligently in the countryside since returning to his hometown three years ago after leaving middle school. He takes on difficulties and, together with other commune members, conquers barren hills and makes outstanding contributions to changing the face of his hometown. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently decided to award Liu Yujin the title of "Red Banner Bearer of Youth Socialist Construction" and called on the youth of the province to learn from him.

    In 1958, inspired by the Great Leap Forward, Liu Yujin, who was studying in middle school, wanted to return to the rural people's commune to participate in production, but he was worried that he was an amateur in agricultural production and could not do anything. When he told the Party Branch Secretary of the former Sanfen Branch of the Wu Rong Senior Agricultural Cooperative about his idea, the branch secretary praised his revolutionary ambition and encouraged him to learn from Xu Jianchun. Liu Yujin immediately told the Party: "What Xu Jianchun can do, I can definitely do."

    When Liu Yujin first participated in agricultural production, he encountered many difficulties. For example, when learning to plow the fields, although he exerted his greatest strength, the cow and the plow were always disobedient, and he was covered in mud and sweat, but the field was still not plowed properly. At this time, people who came back from meetings in the county saw him plowing the field and laughed. Liu Yujin sincerely said to them: "I don't know how, I just started learning today, please teach me." Pan Zhiji, a sixty-year-old Shui commune member, immediately stopped and patiently taught him how to plow the fields. In the labor, because he learned what he didn't know and asked questions about what he didn't understand, he quickly learned many production skills such as plowing and harrowing.

    In the struggle to conquer barren hills, Liu Yujin served as the captain of the third team. He led twenty-seven young people to live on the high mountains and launched a heated competition with the other two teams. When the red flag was snatched away by another team, some team members blamed Liu Yujin, saying: "When the land was divided, you let the other teams pick first, and all the hard-to-dig land was left to our team." Liu Yujin smiled and said: "If it's hard to dig, no one wants it. Should we open up this wasteland or not?" After his patient explanation and help, everyone's enthusiasm was aroused again, and they finally won the red flag back. In this way, the youth shock brigade quickly planted more than 650 dan of tung trees on Mount Baya, opened up 130 mu of wasteland on Mount Wu, and deep plowed 27 mu of low-yield fields. However, some old people in the commune said: "Grass grows but trees don't grow on Mount Baya, melons don't grow on Mount Wu, and low-yield fields see planting but no harvest." The shock team members were not discouraged by these words. They decided to use pen manure to transform the barren and thin soil. In order to complete the task of transporting fertilizer as quickly and efficiently as possible, Liu Yujin discussed it with everyone and decided to use the Pingyong River to transport fertilizer by water. Eight of them, with three boats, carried 3,000 jin per boat, and transported 18,000 jin in one or two trips. With sufficient fertilizer, the crops grew well. In the autumn, on this land where they worked diligently, the tung trees and cassava forests were lush and green. The average yield of rice per mu in low-yield fields was 825 jin, which was double the original yield. (Attached picture)

    树立雄心壮志　征服荒山秃岭
    中学生刘禹金团结公社社员改变家乡面貌
    据新华社贵阳20日电　贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州榕江县古州公社梨子园青年突击队副队长、共产党员刘禹金，三年前离开中学回乡参加农业生产以来，在农村中忘我劳动，勤奋学习，见困难就上，和其他社员一起征服荒山秃岭，为改变家乡面貌做出了优异成绩。共青团贵州省委最近决定授予刘禹金“青年社会主义建设红旗手”称号，号召全省青年向他学习。
    1958年，正在中学读书的刘禹金在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，想回农村人民公社参加生产，但又顾虑自己对农业生产是外行，办不了什么事。当他把自己的想法告诉当时的五榕高级农业社三分社的党支书时，支书赞许他的革命志气，勉励他向徐建春学习。刘禹金当场向党表示：“徐建春能做到的，我也一定能做到。”
    刘禹金初参加农业生产时，碰到了不少困难。如在学习犁田时，虽然他使出了最大力气，牛和犁总不听使唤，弄得泥浆满身，汗流浃背，田还是犁得不像样。这时，从县里开会回来的人看见他犁田的样子，都笑了起来。刘禹金却诚恳地向他们说：“我不会，今天才开始学，请你们教教吧。”六十多岁的水族社员潘志季马上停下来耐心地教他犁田。在劳动中，由于他不会就学，不懂就问，很快就学会了犁田、耙田等许多生产技能。
    在征服荒山秃岭的斗争中，刘禹金担任三分队队长，他带领二十七个青年住上高山，同其他两个分队展开热烈的竞赛。当红旗被别队夺去时，有的队员就责怪刘禹金说：“划分土地时，你让别的队先拣，尽剩下不好挖的落在我们队里。”刘禹金笑着说：“不好挖的大家都不要，这片荒地还开不开呢？”经过他耐心地解释和帮助，又鼓起了大家的干劲，终于把红旗夺了回来。这样，青年突击队很快在八鸦山种上六百五十多担面积的桐子树，在吴山开出一百三十亩荒地，另外二十七亩低产田也都进行了深翻。可是社里有些老年人却说：“八鸦山长草不长树，吴山种瓜不得瓜，低产田见种不见收”。突击队员们听了这些话并没有泄气，他们决定用圈肥来改造瘦田瘠土。为了最快最好地完成运肥任务，刘禹金和大家商量后，决定利用平永河水运肥。他们八个人三只船，一船装三千斤，一两次就运了一万八千斤。肥足庄稼好，到秋天，他们辛勤劳动的这片土地上，桐子树和木薯林一片青葱。低产田里水稻平均亩产八百二十五斤，比原来增产一倍。（附图片）
