    Workers Deliver "Treasure," Crops Grow Well
    Wu Jin'gui, Member of Songjiang Commune, Jiaohe County
    This year during the summer weeding season, right in the middle of the hottest days, we had to apply fertilizer closely behind the hoeing and weeding of the rice paddies. Just at that moment, the Jilin Calcium Carbide Factory sent us over 70,000 jin of ammonium sulfate. After our Dafangniugou Production Team got this "treasure," we worked from dawn till dusk to apply it to the fields. The rice stalks that were fertilized with ammonium sulfate grew thick and the ears were large. The foot-and-a-half-long heads drooped heavily, truly a sight to admire. The golden, heavy heads of rice on the more than ten hectares fertilized with ammonium sulfate are almost ready for harvest.
    I, Wu Jin'gui, am already an old farmer in my fifties. I've been farming in Songjiang for over twenty years, and I've rarely seen such good crops as this year! Where did it come from? We all know clearly that it's the result of industry supporting agriculture under the leadership of the Party.
    The worker comrades are supporting us so much, we are determined to increase grain production even more. The commune members say, we won't stop managing the grain until it's in our hands! We will certainly make the "treasure" delivered by the workers blossom and bear fruit in the fields.

### 工人送来“宝”庄稼长得好

    工人送来“宝”庄稼长得好
    蛟河县松江公社社员　吴金贵
    今年夏锄时节，正是三伏天，铲趟、薅水稻都得紧跟着追肥。就在这时候，吉林电石厂给我们公社送来了七万多斤硫铵，我们大放牛沟生产队得了这个“宝”以后，起早贪黑地往地里追。追硫铵的谷子长得秆粗穗大，尺八长的穗头沉甸甸搭拉着，真着人稀罕。十多公顷追硫铵的水稻，那金黄色沉甸甸的穗头就要开镰了。
    我吴金贵已经是个五十来岁的老庄稼汉了，在松江这地方种了二十多年地，像今年这样的好庄稼可真是少见哪！这是哪来的呢？我们都明明白白的知道，这是在党的领导下，工业支援农业得来的。
    工人大哥这么支援我们，我们决心增产更多的粮食。社员们说，粮食不到手管理不停！一定叫工人送来的“宝”在庄稼地里开花结果。
