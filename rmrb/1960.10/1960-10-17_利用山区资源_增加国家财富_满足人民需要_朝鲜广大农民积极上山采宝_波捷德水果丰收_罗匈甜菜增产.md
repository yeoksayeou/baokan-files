Xinhua News Agency:  In response to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to "rely on the mountains for sustenance" and to "comprehensively utilize mountain areas," agricultural cooperatives in northern Korea are taking active steps. Since the beginning of September, members have organized labor forces to go up the mountains and into the forests to widely collect "mountain treasures"—various mountain fruits, vegetables, medicinal herbs, and winter feed for livestock—natural resources to increase national wealth.

77% of the land in northern Korea is mountainous, and the mountains are very rich in resources.

Changcheng County, "an example of utilizing mountain areas" in northern Korea, can produce ninety-eight kinds of food and daily necessities using only the abundant resources from the mountains, meeting the needs of the people within the county.

In order to collect quickly and abundantly, agricultural cooperatives in Jagang Province sent specialists in August to investigate the distribution of mountain fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs, and determined September and October as the period for "collecting mountain treasures." They also clearly divided the labor according to the strength of the workforce. The "mountain fruit picking team" of Xianghe Agricultural Cooperative in Changjiang County went deep into the Rangrim Mountains and collected an average of thirty kilograms of mountain fruit per person per day. The agricultural laborers of this county are determined to collect more than 1,700 tons of mountain fruit in September and October.

Food processing factories in various counties in northern Korea have already prepared for processing mountain fruits and vegetables. They adopt the method of collecting, purchasing, and processing simultaneously, and promptly turn the mountain fruits and vegetables collected by the members into food, wine, or oil. The transportation department also promptly transports various "mountain treasures" to the processing factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: Poland's fruits and vegetables have had a bumper harvest this year.

There are a total of 45 million fruit trees in Poland. In normal years, these fruit trees can yield about 500,000 to 600,000 tons of fruit, but this year's harvest can reach more than 900,000 tons. This can not only meet the needs of the domestic market but also be exported to the Soviet Union and other neighboring countries.

Poland plants about 200,000 hectares of vegetables every year, with an annual harvest of 3 million tons. Due to the bumper harvest of vegetables, this year Poland's per capita consumption of fresh vegetables can reach 100 kilograms.

In order to promote the continued development of fruit and vegetable cultivation, the state is vigorously supplying chemical fertilizers and pesticides to fruit and vegetable farmers and providing loans.

This newspaper reports: Czechoslovakia has had a bumper fruit harvest this year. It is estimated that about 200,000 tons of fruit can be supplied to the market this year, which is almost double the original planned quantity for 1960.

Nearly 20,000 tons of apples will be processed above the plan this year. The production plan for cider will be overfulfilled by 50%. The production of pears is particularly high this year. It is estimated that the original processing plan for apples and pears in Czechoslovak canning factories will be overfulfilled by about 45%.

It is expected that this year's fruit consumption will exceed the planned figure, which is 34.8% more than in 1955.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The German Democratic Republic has had a bumper fruit harvest this year. According to preliminary statistics, the harvests of major fruits such as apples, pears, and plums will all reach the level of the bumper harvest of 1958. These three kinds of fruits totaled more than 870,000 tons in 1958.

Currently, efforts are being organized throughout the country to harvest various fruits without loss and to do a good job in fruit processing, sales, and storage. Many special districts, especially fruit farmers in the fruit-rich Potsdam and Halle districts, are particularly busy. Thousands of workers, staff, and housewives have come to the fruit-producing areas to help with the selection, loading, unloading, and transportation. The State Purchasing Bureau has set up additional purchasing stations in the fruit-producing areas and extended working hours. This year's state purchase of apples and pears will increase from 147,000 tons in 1958 to 200,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: This year, the average sugar production of Romanian sugar factories in three and a half months will be equal to the total sugar production in 1938.

Currently, sugar factories are fully engaged in processing sugar beets. This year, Romania's sugar beets are growing well and have a high sugar content.

Romania will produce more than 325,000 tons of sugar this year, an increase of 41% over 1959 and 3.4 times over 1938. This year, the sugar produced in Romania can meet the needs of the residents. Romania's sugar production will continue to increase steadily in the coming years. Four sugar factories will be built between 1960 and 1956.

Xinhua News Agency: This year, Hungary's sugar beet harvest is very good. The amount of sugar beets provided to the state by agricultural cooperatives across the country this year will be greatly increased compared to last year, thereby enabling sugar factories to process and produce 2,000 more railcars of sugar than last year.

    利用山区资源　增加国家财富　满足人民需要
    朝鲜广大农民积极上山采宝
    波捷德水果丰收　罗匈甜菜增产
    据新华社讯　朝鲜北部各农业社以积极的行动响应朝鲜劳动党的“靠山吃山”、“综合利用山区”的号召。9月开初以来，社员们纷纷组织劳动力上山入林，广泛采集“山中之宝”——各种山果、山菜、药材和牲畜过冬饲料等自然资源，增加国家财富。
    朝鲜北部77％的土地是山区，山里资源非常丰富。
    朝鲜北部“利用山区的榜样”—昌城郡，仅用山区出产的丰富资源就能制作出九十八种食品和日用品，满足郡内人民的需要。
    慈江道各农业社为了采得快、采得多，在8月间派专人调查好了山果、山菜、药材的分布情况，确定9、10月为“采集山中之宝”的时期。他们还按照劳动力的强弱，明确分工。长江郡香河农业社的“采山果班”深入到狼林山里，平均每人每天采三十公斤山果。这个郡的农业劳动者决心在9、10月间采集一千七百多吨山果。
    朝鲜北部各郡的食品加工厂早已作好加工山果、山菜的准备。它们采用随采、随购、随加工的方法，及时地把社员们采集的山果、山菜制成食品、酒类或油料。运输部门也及时把各种“山中之宝”运到加工厂。
    据新华社华沙电　波兰今年的　水果和蔬菜获得丰收。
    波兰全国各地共有四千五百万棵果树。在平常年景，这些果树约能收获五十到六十万吨水果，而今年的收获量则可以达到九十多万吨。这不仅可以满足国内市场需要，而且还可以向苏联和其他邻近的国家出口。
    波兰每年种植蔬菜约二十万公顷，全年收获量达三百万吨。由于蔬菜丰收，今年波兰按人口平均计算的新鲜蔬菜消费量可以达到每人一百公斤。
    为了促进水果和蔬菜种植业的继续发展，国家正在大力向果农和菜农供应化学肥料和防治病虫害的药品，并且发放贷款。
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克今年水果获得丰收。据预计，今年可向市场供应水果二十万吨左右，这几乎比1960年的原订计划数量增加了一倍。
    今年将超计划加工将近两万吨苹果。苹果酒的产量计划将超额50％完成。梨的产量今年特别高，据估计，在捷克斯洛伐克的罐头工厂中，原订的苹果和梨的加工计划将超额完成45％左右。
    预料，今年水果消费量比1955年增加34.8％的计划数字将超额完成。
    据新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国今年水果丰收。据初步统计，苹果、梨和李子等主要水果的收获量都将达到大丰收的1958年水平。这三种水果在1958年共收获了八十七万多吨。
    目前，全国各地正在组织力量把各种水果不受损失地收进来和做好水果加工、销售和储藏工作。许多专区，特别是盛产水果的波茨坦和哈雷专区的果农特别繁忙。成千上万的工人、职员、家庭妇女来到水果产区帮助挑选、装卸和运输。国家收购局在水果产区增设了收购站，并延长了工作时间。今年苹果和梨的国家收购量将从1958年的十四万七千吨增加到二十万吨。
    新华社布加勒斯特讯　今年罗马尼亚制糖厂平均三个半月的糖产量将等于1938年全年的糖产量。
    目前，制糖厂正在全面开展为甜菜进行加工。今年罗马尼亚的甜菜生长良好，含糖量很高。
    罗马尼亚今年将生产三十二万五千多吨糖，比1959年增加41％，比1938年增加为三点四倍。今年，罗马尼亚所生产的糖可以满足居民的需要。罗马尼亚的糖产量在今后几年中将继续稳定地增加。在1960年到1956年期间，将兴建四座制糖厂。
    据新华社讯　今年匈牙利甜菜的收获情况很好。全国农业合作社今年提供给国家的甜菜将比去年大大增多，从而使制糖厂有可能比去年多加工制成两千个车皮的糖。（附图片）
