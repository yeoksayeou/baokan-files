New Development of Friendship between China and Mali

On October 14th, Modibo Keita, Prime Minister of the Republic of Mali, sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, announcing the recognition of the People's Republic of China as an independent and sovereign country, and expressing his willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our government on the basis of fruitful cooperation and sincere friendship. On October 17th, Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country replied to Prime Minister Modibo Keita, stating that the People's Republic of China has decided to recognize the Republic of Mali as an independent and sovereign country, and hopes to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Mali as soon as possible on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. The mutual recognition between China and the Republic of Mali not only marks a new development in the friendship between the Chinese and Malian people and shows broad prospects for friendly cooperation between the two governments, but also indicates that the friendly relations between China and the newly independent African countries are developing rapidly. This is something we should warmly celebrate.

The Republic of Mali is a young African country. Since it declared its independence on September 22nd, it has taken a series of measures in less than a month to safeguard and consolidate national independence and has been making unremitting efforts to eradicate the forces of imperialism and colonialism. In the past, the army and police of the Republic of Mali were controlled by French colonial officers; now, the Malian government has begun to reorganize the police force and gradually remove French officers from the army. The Malian government has established a national exchange bureau and a people's bank, and is preparing to take measures to control domestic and foreign trade, gradually changing its financial and economic dependence on imperialism. In terms of foreign relations, the Republic of Mali has clearly stated that it will establish and develop friendly cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence, oppose imperialist wars, and support the struggles of African countries for national independence and against colonialism, especially the struggle of the Algerian people, support the legal government of the Congo, and severely condemn imperialist aggression and interference in the Congo. Recently, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Aou, the head of the delegation of the Republic of Mali, righteously refuted the Western countries' nonsense about the so-called "civilizing role" played by imperialists in the colonies, and emphasized that the struggle for independence must rely on the tenacious and arduous struggle of the people, and that colonialists will never be "magnanimous."

The newborn Republic of Mali dares to fight against imperialism and colonialism, and sympathizes with and supports the struggle of the oppressed people for independence and maintaining autonomy. This not only conforms to the national interests of the Malian people, but is also conducive to the cause of the world's people against imperialist wars and policies of aggression, as well as the maintenance of world peace. The just position taken by the Republic of Mali has won the admiration and welcome of African countries and peoples, as well as all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world. The Chinese government and people have always expressed deep sympathy and support for the Malian people's struggle to break free from colonial control and strive for national independence, and are pleased with every achievement made by the Malian people on the road to independent development. The Chinese and Malian people have always cared for and supported each other in the common struggle against imperialism. In his telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, Prime Minister Modibo Keita wished "the People's Republic of China to defeat all imperialist conspiracies"; the Chinese people also sincerely wish the government and people of the Republic of Mali to continuously achieve new victories in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of national independence in the future.

In recent years, the Chinese people have had the honor of receiving friends from Mali. They not only brought the profound friendship of the Malian people, but also brought the sympathy and support of the 650 million Chinese people to the African national independence movement in West Africa. We believe that with the mutual recognition and formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly cooperative relations between our two countries will continue to develop, and the friendship between our two peoples will grow day by day.

    中国和马里友谊的新发展
    10月14日，马里共和国总理莫迪博·凯塔致电我国周恩来总理，宣布承认中华人民共和国为独立自主的国家，并表示愿在卓有成效的合作和诚挚的友谊的基础上与我国政府建立外交关系。10月17日，我国周恩来总理和陈毅外交部长分别复电莫迪博·凯塔总理，表示中华人民共和国决定承认马里共和国为独立自主的国家，并希望能够在互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上同马里共和国早日建立外交关系。中国和马里共和国的相互承认，不仅标志着中马两国人民友谊的新发展，为中马两国政府的友好合作展示了广阔的前途，而且表明中国同非洲新独立国家之间的友好关系正在迅速发展。这是值得我们热烈庆贺的。
    马里共和国是一个年青的非洲国家。它从9月22日宣告独立，已经在不到一个月的期间里，采取了一系列维护和巩固民族独立的措施，为铲除帝国主义和殖民主义的势力进行着不懈的努力。过去，马里共和国的军队和警察都控制在法国殖民军官的手中；现在，马里政府已经开始了整顿警察队伍，逐步清除军队中的法国军官。马里政府建立起国家汇兑局和人民银行，准备采取措施对国内外贸易实行控制，逐步改变在财政经济上对帝国主义的依赖关系。在对外关系方面，马里共和国明确表示要在和平共处的基础上同所有国家建立和发展友好合作的关系，反对帝国主义战争，支持非洲各国人民的反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争，特别是支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，支持刚果合法政府，严厉谴责帝国主义对刚果的侵略和干涉。最近，马里共和国代表团团长阿乌在联合国大会的发言中，义正词严地驳斥了西方国家代表关于帝国主义者在殖民地起了所谓“文明作用”这样一种胡说，着重指出争取独立必须依靠人民顽强艰苦的斗争，殖民主义者决不会“宽宏大量”。
    新生的马里共和国敢于同帝国主义、殖民主义进行斗争，并且同情和支持被压迫人民争取和维护独立自主的斗争，这不仅符合于马里人民的民族利益，也有利于世界人民反对帝国主义战争和侵略政策、维护世界和平的事业。马里共和国采取的正义立场，得到了非洲国家和人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民的钦佩和欢迎。中国政府和人民一向对马里人民摆脱殖民主义控制、争取民族独立的斗争，表示深切的同情和支持，并为马里人民在独立发展的道路上所获得的每一项成就感到高兴。中国人民和马里人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中始终是互相关怀、互相支持的。莫迪博·凯塔总理在致我国周恩来总理的电报中，祝“中华人民共和国击败帝国主义的一切阴谋”；中国人民也衷心祝愿马里共和国政府和人民在今后反对帝国主义和维护民族独立的斗争中，不断取得新的胜利。
    最近几年来，中国人民荣幸地接待了来自马里的朋友。他们不但带来了马里人民深厚的情谊，而且把六亿五千万中国人民对非洲民族独立运动的同情和支持，带往西非洲。我们相信，随着我们两国间的相互承认和外交关系的正式建立，我们两国间的友好合作关系将不断得到发展，我们两国人民间的友谊也将与日俱增。
