Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, sent a telegram on the 19th to the Japan-China Friendship Association and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty, firmly supporting the 23rd unified action of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The telegram stated that shortly after the Ikeda government came to power, it clearly revealed that it had inherited the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which violated the interests of the Japanese people, continued to follow the United States, was hostile to China, revived Japanese militarism, and seriously endangered peace in Asia and the world. Recently, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries condoned fascist thugs in the assassination of Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, a staunch fighter who had always stood at the forefront of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and an outstanding patriotic Japanese politician, in an attempt to use bloody violence to undermine the unity of the Japanese people and suppress their just, anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. However, the Japanese people will never be intimidated or subdued by such vile atrocities; on the contrary, they will further strengthen their unity and launch a new wave of powerful struggles to answer the conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

The telegram stated that the 650 million Chinese people will forever stand with the Japanese people who oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, strive for democracy and independence, safeguard world peace, and promote China-Japan friendship, and resolutely support the Japanese people's just, anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. We firmly believe that the great cause of the Japanese people in striving for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality will achieve even more brilliant victories.

    楚图南致电日中友协
    支持日本二十三次统一行动
    新华社20日讯　中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南19日致电日本中国友好协会并转阻止修改安全条约国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对日美军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次统一行动。
    电报说，池田政府上台不久，就明显地暴露出它继承了岸信介内阁的违反日本人民利益、继续追随美国、敌视中国、复活日本军国主义、严重地危害亚洲和世界和平的反动政策。最近，美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒刺杀了在反对日美军事同盟条约斗争中一直站在最前列的坚强战士、日本卓越的爱国政治家浅沼稻次郎先生，妄图用血腥暴力来破坏日本人民团结和镇压日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争。但是，日本人民决不会为这种卑鄙的暴行所吓倒，所压服，相反地他们将进一步加强团结，掀起声势浩大的新的斗争浪潮来回答美日反动派的阴谋。
    电报说，六万万五千万中国人民永远同反对美帝国主义侵略，争取民主、独立，维护世界和平，促进中日友好的日本人民站在一起，坚决支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争。我们坚信，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的伟大事业一定会取得更辉煌的胜利。
