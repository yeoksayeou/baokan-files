Of All Things Precious, Human Labor is the Most Precious
    Tang Xiaoding
    Currently, all fronts are economizing and adjusting labor, strengthening the agricultural front line. People recognize that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Agricultural technological transformation has only just begun, natural disasters are frequent, and the task of supporting agriculture is significant. "In order to save labor to support agriculture, we ourselves must increase production without increasing manpower, and reduce manpower while increasing production." However, there are also individual units whose manpower could be saved but are unwilling to do so, their "reason" being a commonly used phrase: "More people makes things easier!"
    "More people makes things easier" can be said to be a truth in actual life.
    Chairman Mao said: "What is the real wall of iron and steel? It is the masses, the millions of people who wholeheartedly support the revolution." "More people means more discussion, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." This is a viewpoint that firmly believes in and relies on the masses of the people, a viewpoint of the thorough mass line. The consciousness and initiative of the people are the fundamental conditions for the victorious development of the revolutionary cause. The revolutionary mass movement is a movement of great collective heroism.
    However, some people use "more people makes things easier" as an excuse, only caring about their own unit being "convenient" with "more people," without careful calculation, without considering the possibility of saving manpower, and not obeying the overall needs and arrangements. For them, the so-called "more people makes things easier" is not truly believing in and relying on the masses, but underestimating the initiative and subjective dynamic role of the masses. "More people makes things easier" becomes a shield in their hands for dispersing and wasting manpower.
    During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, Chairman Mao repeatedly urged everyone to "pay great attention to the economical use of manpower and material resources." He said that only in this way can we "be invincible" and achieve victory. (See "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, pages 1174 and 1185) Chairman Mao's teachings are worth remembering forever.
    Of all things precious, human labor is the most precious. Under the socialist system, there is no longer the unemployment and massive waste of manpower as in capitalist society. Everyone can develop greatly and achieve great things, and everyone is "beginning to consciously create their own history." But as a leader, one should economize on the use of manpower at all times. It is necessary to arrange manpower according to the overall arrangement, so that everyone can be in their proper place, develop their abilities, and make the greatest contribution to revolution and construction.
    "More people makes things easier"? That's right. But this is not absolute or unconditional. Correctly arranging manpower, more people makes things easier; incorrectly arranging manpower, "more people makes things easier" will also be transformed into its opposite. If a department or a unit has more personnel than needed, with redundant staff, and duplicated and bloated organizations, "more people makes things easier" will become "more people makes things difficult."
    Under the education of the Communist Party, the working masses are rich in revolutionary ideals, revolutionary integrity, and revolutionary perseverance. Mount Tai does not consider itself high, and the East Sea does not consider itself large. For anything that the revolution and construction need to do, they are not afraid of quantity or difficulty. Workers have said in their poems: "Give full play to all your energy, and be sure to stretch the red line to the sky!" Between people and things, there is only a scale of need and possibility, not a fixed proportion. If people have great revolutionary ambitions and are willing to work hard, even a chicken coop can grow into a golden phoenix. As long as the masses have a high degree of awareness, fewer but more efficient people can also do good things. You see, after some departments transferred manpower to support agriculture, they launched a technical innovation movement, and a large number of new phenomena such as "one top two," "one top three," and "one top several" appeared, didn't they? Isn't the production task still being completed? Those who excuse "more people makes things easier" only see the number of people, but not their mental state, and naturally do not recognize the potential of work and production. There is such a discussion: "People are not machines. Changing the parts of a machine can increase efficiency several times, but people cannot." This is a very unwise "insight." Those who support this argument forget: Who manufactures, masters, and improves the machine? Can it "change" its own "parts" by itself? Seeing only the number of people but not their mental state is a deformed version of this vulgar view of seeing only things but not people.
    Socialism and communism are collective undertakings, and collective undertakings are like a game of chess. Since it is a game of chess, all officials, elephants, horses, and chariots must be uniformly dispatched in order to win. China is a large country with many people and many things to do. Who does what, and how many people do how much, must be subject to the overall task and overall arrangement, distinguishing between primary and secondary, important and unimportant, urgent and slow, in order to ensure continued leap forward. We can only make long-term plans, use manpower and material resources very sparingly, and use them in the most needed places and fronts, first of all in the agricultural front line, to lay a solid foundation for the national economy, in order to be invincible forever.
    Below are two examples of "fewer people doing more work":
    The workers of the Seventh Engineering Section of the Chengdu Railway Bureau once proposed: "One worker does ten squares, and the number of personnel is reduced by half." Some people thought this was impossible, saying: "Unless it is a living immortal, and even immortals need a mountain-driving whip!" Most people believed: "Workers are living immortals, and their hands are the mountain-driving whip!" Everyone carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and in less than two months, the average work efficiency exceeded ten squares, and the number of personnel was reduced by more than half.
    In the market town of Jianxing Commune in Nanbu County, there is a cotton transfer station and a ginnery. Originally, there were many contract workers and low labor efficiency, with an average of about forty catties of cotton ginned per person per day. After reducing more than half of the contract workers, strengthening education, and improving work, labor efficiency rose rapidly. According to the calculation on the third day after the personnel reduction, the average amount of cotton ginned per person reached seventy-nine catties, and the highest reached one hundred and twenty-six and a half catties.
    Those who use "more people makes things easier" to cover up waste of manpower and backward conditions can draw very useful things from these two examples.
    We advocate thrift. People's attention is usually more focused on the economizing of materials. No problem, the economizing of materials is very important. But even more important is the economizing of labor, the economizing of people, because all wealth is created by labor.

    千贵万贵，人力最贵
    唐小丁
    现在，各条战线都在节约和调剂劳动力，加强农业第一线。人们都认识到农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，农业技术改造才开始，自然灾害多，支援农业的任务大，“为了节约劳动力支援农业，我们自己要增产不增人，减人也增产”。然而也另有个别单位的人力能够节约而不愿节约，他们的“理由”是惯用的一句话：“人多好办事呀！”
    “人多好办事”，可以说是实际生活中的一个真理。
    毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”这是坚决地相信和依靠人民群众的观点，是彻底的群众路线的观点。人民群众的自觉性和积极性，是革命事业胜利发展的根本条件。革命的群众运动，是伟大集体的英雄主义的运动。
    然而有人把“人多好办事”作为借口，只顾自己单位“人多”“方便”，不精打细算，不考虑节约人力的可能，不服从全局的需要和安排。在他那里，所谓“人多好办事”，不是真正地相信和依靠群众，而是低估群众的积极性和主观能动作用。“人多好办事”，成了他手里的分散和浪费人力的挡箭牌。
    毛主席在第三次国内革命战争时期，一而再地要大家“十分注意人力物力的节省使用”。他说，只有这样，我们才能“立于不败之地”，取得胜利。（见《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第1174页和1185页）毛主席的教导，是值得我们永远记住的。
    千贵万贵，人力最贵。在社会主义制度下，已经没有资本主义社会那样的失业和大量浪费人力的事了，每个人都能大有发展，大有作为，都在“开始充分自觉地自己创造自己的历史”。但是作为一个领导者，任何时候都应当节约地使用人力。要按照全局的安排，使每个人各得其所，各展其能，对革命和建设，作出最大的贡献。
    “人多好办事”吗？不错。但这也不是绝对的，毫无条件的。正确地安排人力，人多就好办事；不正确地安排人力，“人多好办事”也会转化为它的反面。一个部门或一个单位，如果人员超过了需要，人浮于事，机构重复、臃肿，“人多好办事”就会变成“人多难办事”。
    在共产党的教育下，劳动群众富有革命理想、革命气节和革命毅力。泰山不以为高，东海不以为大。凡是革命和建设需要办的事，一不怕多，二不怕难。工人的诗歌里就说过：“浑身干劲使出来，管叫红线伸上天！”人和事之间，只有需要和可能的尺度，没有固定的比例。人有革命大志，又肯埋头苦干，土鸡窝也能长出金凤凰来。只要群众有了高度觉悟，人少而精，也能办好事。你看，有些部门抽调人力支援农业后，开展技术革新运动，不就大量出现了“一顶二”、“一顶三”、“一顶几”的新气象了吗？增产任务不照样完成吗？借口“人多好办事”的人，却只见人的多少，而不见人的这种精神状态，自然也就不承认工作潜力和生产潜力。有这样一种议论：“人不是机器，机器改变一下部件，可以成倍地提高效率，人是不行的。”这是十分不高明的“高见”。拥护这种议论的人忘记了：机器由谁制造、掌握和改进？难道它能自己“改变一下”自己的“部件”吗？只见人的多少而不见人的精神状态，就是这种只见物而不见人的庸俗观点的一个变形。
    社会主义、共产主义是集体的事业，集体的事业是一盘棋。既成一盘棋，无论仕相马车，都要统一调度，才能制胜。我国是个大国，人多事多，什么人办什么事，多少人办多少事，要服从总的任务和总的安排，分别主次、轻重、先后、缓急，才能保证继续跃进。我们只有作持久打算，十分节约地使用人力物力，把他们和它们用到最需要的地方和战线上去，首先是用到农业第一线去，打好国民经济的基础，才能永远立于不败之地。
    下面是两个“人少多办事”的例子：
    成都铁路管理局第七工程处的职工，曾经提出：“一工十方，人员减半”。有人认为这不可能，说：“除非是活神仙，神仙还要有赶山鞭！”多数人却认为：“工人就是活神仙，双手就是赶山鞭！”大家大闹技术革新和技术革命，不到两个月，平均工效超过了十方，人员节约了一半多。
    南部县建兴公社的场镇上，有个棉花转运站并轧花厂，原来合同工多，劳动效率低，平均每人每天轧花约四十斤。裁减一半多合同工、加强教育、改进工作后，劳动效率迅速上升。按裁减人员后第三天的计算，平均每人轧花量就达到七十九斤，最高的达到一百二十六斤半。
    用“人多好办事”掩盖人力浪费和落后状况的人，从这两个例子中可以汲取十分有益的东西。
    我们提倡节约。人们注意力通常比较偏重于物资的节约。没有问题，物资的节约是非常重要的。但是，更重要的是劳动力的节约，人的节约，因为一切财富都是劳动力创造的。
