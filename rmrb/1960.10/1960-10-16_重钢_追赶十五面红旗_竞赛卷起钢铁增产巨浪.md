    Chongqing Iron and Steel "Chasing Fifteen Red Flags" Competition Unleashes a Surge in Steel Production
    In Ten Days, the Whole Company Saw the Emergence of More Than Two Thousand Five Hundred Advanced Individuals and More Than Four Hundred Thirty Advanced Collectives, Eighteen Units Created More Than Three Thousand Seven Hundred New Records
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, October 15th) The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee vigorously grasped the political and ideological work of employees, erected red flags in a big way, established pace-setters in a big way, used the advanced to drive the backward, organized the backward to catch up with the advanced, and launched a massive "Chasing Fifteen Red Flags" competition throughout the company, rapidly raising production to a new level. Comparing the average daily production level from October 1st to 12th with September, steel increased sharply by 24.67%, steel材 [steel products, steel materials] increased sharply by 30.34%, and iron increased sharply by 26.98%.
    At the beginning of October, after conscientious evaluation from the bottom up and from the top down, the employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company selected fifteen red flags from more than four hundred advanced collectives in the company. And launched a massive competition to "Chase Fifteen Red Flags". These red flags included various furnaces and major types of work. Because of their adherence to putting politics in command and their tenacious overcoming of difficulties, their production ran far ahead of furnaces and teams of the same type as themselves. When deciding to launch the competition to learn from and catch up with the fifteen red flags, the company's Party Committee first conscientiously summarized and promoted the advanced thinking and advanced experience of these red flag units, pointing out to all employees the goals and content of learning from them. Before and during the launch of the competition to chase the fifteen red flags, the company and factory leaders also conducted a series of political and ideological work among cadres and the masses, fully mobilizing the masses. The company's Party Committee not only convened meetings of Party members and cadres, but also convened the company's representative meeting of advanced producers, youth and women activists, and mass rallies, speaking to the broad masses of employees about the situation and assigning tasks in a big way. The factories and workshops and work sections also convened workers' heart-to-heart talks and detailed accounting meetings. In this way, a good foundation was laid for launching the movement to learn from and catch up with the fifteen red flags.
    In order to lead this movement well, Party committees at all levels established "Chasing Fifteen Red Flags Movement" offices, headed by the secretaries, to check the progress of the movement every day and every shift, evaluate on the spot, summarize experience on the spot, and promote experience on the spot, ensuring that advanced experience did not go beyond the shift or stay overnight. Because the objects of pursuit were clear, there were indicators for catching up with the advanced, and there were specific measures and dates for reaching the advanced level, the masses were in high spirits and felt that there was much to be done in learning from the advanced. Converter Plant No. 4, which had always lagged behind in production, organized more than 300 employees this time to fully learn from the experience of Converter Plant No. 3, and after returning, they launched discussions and revised the catch-up plan, determined to catch up with the advanced level. The leaders of some factories also "built ladders" for backward individuals and groups, asking them to first catch up with the pace-setters of their own factory and work section, and then catch up with the higher advanced level after catching up with the nearby advanced level. This made these units and individuals even more filled with confidence in catching up with the advanced.
    After the masses were mobilized, the power of the "Chasing Fifteen Red Flags" competition was immediately demonstrated. The whole company was in a new upsurge of striving for the top, and good news was heard everywhere. In chasing the "Three Stars Shining Brightly Furnace" -- No. 3 Open Hearth Furnace of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Plant, one of the fifteen red flags, No. 4 Furnace of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Plant conscientiously checked the reasons for its backwardness. Everyone believed that their furnace conditions and personnel were about the same as those of No. 3 Furnace, but they lacked the spirit of the workers in No. 3 Furnace being of one heart, one mind, and one appearance, so they fell behind. After learning from the experience of No. 3 Furnace in this regard, in the first week of October, they had fully caught up with and surpassed No. 3 Furnace in terms of output, quality, utilization coefficient, and operating rate, taking the lead in the plant-wide competition. In the competition to chase No. 2 converter of this plant, one of the fifteen red flags, No. 3 converter of Converter Plant No. 3, the two furnaces learned from each other and helped each other, and the furnace age was leading in the entire company. In the ten days since the launch of the movement, 2,520 advanced individuals and 437 advanced collectives have emerged in the company. According to statistics from eighteen production units, more than 3,700 new records have appeared in the past ten days, ensuring a substantial increase in various productions.

    追有目标　学有榜样　人人鼓起力争上游的新劲头
    重钢“追赶十五面红旗”竞赛卷起钢铁增产巨浪
    十天中全公司涌现了两千五百多名先进人物和四百三十多个先进集体，十八个单位创造了三千七百多次新纪录
    本报重庆15日电　中共重庆钢铁公司党委大抓职工政治思想工作，大树红旗，大立标兵，以先进带动落后，组织落后追上先进，在全公司掀起一个声势浩大的“追赶十五面红旗”竞赛运动，迅速将生产提高到一个新的水平。以10月1日至12日的平均日产水平同9月份比较，钢猛增了24.67％，钢材猛增了30.34％，铁猛增了26.98％。
    10月初，重庆钢铁公司职工经过自下而上和自上而下地认真评比，在全公司四百多个先进集体中评出了十五面红旗。并且开展了声势浩大的“追赶十五面红旗”的竞赛运动。这些红旗包括各种炉子、各主要工种，他们由于坚持政治挂帅，顽强战胜困难，生产远远跑在和自己同类型的炉子、班组的前面。公司党委在决定开展学习追赶十五面红旗竞赛时，首先认真总结和宣扬了这些红旗单位的先进思想和先进经验，向所有职工指出了学习他们的目标和内容。在开展追赶十五面红旗竞赛前和竞赛中，公司和各厂领导又在干部和群众中进行了一系列的政治思想工作，充分地发动了群众。公司党委不仅召开了党员大会、干部会议，而且召开了全公司先进生产者代表大会、青年和妇女积极分子大会、群众大会，向广大职工群众大讲形势、大交任务。各厂和各车间、工段也都召开了工人的谈心会、算细账会。这样，就为开展学习追赶十五面红旗运动打下了很好的基础。
    为了领导好这一运动，各级党委成立了“追赶十五面红旗运动”办公室，由书记挂帅，每天、每班检查运动开展的情况，当场评比，当场总结经验，当场推广经验，作到先进经验不过班不过夜。由于追赶对象明确，有追赶先进的指标，有达到先进水平的具体措施和日期，群众情绪很高，感到向先进看齐大有可为。一向生产走在后面的转炉四厂，这次组织了三百多个职工，到转炉三厂全面学习经验，回来后就展开讨论，修订追赶规划，决心要赶上先进水平。有的厂的领导还给后进的个人和小组“搭楼梯”，要他们先赶本厂和本工段的标兵，追上了就近的先进水平以后再来追赶更高的先进水平。这样就使这些单位和个人更加充满了追赶先进的信心。
    群众发动起来以后，“追赶十五面红旗”竞赛的威力立即显示出来。全公司一片力争上游的新劲头，到处传出报捷声。平炉二厂四号炉追赶在十五面红旗之一的“三星高照炉”——平炉二厂三号炉中，认真检查了自己落后的原因。大家认为自己的炉子条件和三号炉一样，人员也差不多，就是缺乏三号炉那种全炉工人一条心、一股劲、一个样的精神，因此掉了队。他们学习了三号炉这方面的经验后，10月份的第一周，在产量、质量、利用系数、作业率等项指标方面，已经全面赶上和超过了三号炉，在全厂竞赛中领了先。转炉三厂三号转炉在追赶十五面红旗之一的本厂二号转炉的竞赛中，两座炉子互相学习，互相帮助，炉龄都在全公司领先。运动开展十天来，全公司已经涌现了两千五百二十名先进人物和四百三十七个先进集体。据十八个生产单位统计，最近十天来出现的新纪录就有三千七百多次，保证了各项生产的大幅度上升。
