Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 4th: Huang Guo Sheng, Acting Minister of Commerce of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement at a press conference today on the issue of restoring trade relations between the North and South regions of Vietnam. The statement reiterated the proposal: While awaiting the reunification of the country through free general elections, both sides must meet to discuss ways to restore trade relations between the two regions, first of all allowing people from both regions within the demilitarized zone to travel conveniently;

    Relevant institutions and enterprises in North Vietnam are ready at any time to purchase slow-selling products from the South at fair and reasonable prices on the basis of developing long-term trade relations. At the same time, they will give priority to selling coal, cement, fertilizer, machinery, etc. to the South at prices lower than export prices; the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will not levy import duties on goods from South Vietnam, nor will it levy export duties on goods sold to South Vietnam.

    The statement calls on industrialists, businessmen, and people across the country to take all forms and methods to force the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to abandon their economic policy attached to the United States, restore trade relations between the two regions, and then achieve peaceful reunification of the country through free general elections.

    建议越南南北双方恢复贸易关系
    据新华社河内4日电　越南民主共和国商业部代理部长黄国盛今天在记者招待会上，就越南南北两地区恢复贸易关系的问题发表了一项声明。声明再一次提出建议：双方在等待通过自由普选实现祖国统一的期间，必须进行会晤以讨论恢复两地区的贸易关系的办法，首先是允许非军事区内两地区人民能够方便地来往；
    越南北方有关机构和企业随时准备在有利于发展长久的贸易关系的基础上，以公平合理的价格购买南方的滞销产品，同时以比出口更低的价格优先卖给南方煤炭、水泥、化肥、机器等；越南民主共和国对越南南方的商品不收入口税，卖到南方的商品也不抽出口税。
    声明号召全国的工商业者和人民采取一切形式和办法来迫使吴庭艳当局放弃附属于美国的经济政策，恢复两地区的贸易关系，进而通过自由普选实现和平统一祖国。
