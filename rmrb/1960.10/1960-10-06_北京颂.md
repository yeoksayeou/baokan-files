    Ode to Beijing
    Fang Zixing, Wang Shu, He Bo, et al.

    I. Dear Beijing, Shijingshan, you are drumming; Yongding River, you are playing the zither; spring thunder, you are accompanying us. We sing of dear Beijing. The solemn and reverent Xinhua Gate, you embody the hearts of 600 million people. Chairman Mao plans a great future for us; brightness and happiness are born here. The magnificent Great Hall of the People, a symbol of the wisdom of the working people. Revolutionary experiences are exchanged here, making the motherland forever beautiful and young. The splendid East and West Chang'an Avenue, leading to distant cities and villages. Here, steel commanders fly coal and transport minerals; there, grain commanders send troops and deploy forces. The wide Tiananmen Square, red flags like the sea, songs of joy. We march from victory to victory; you are the witness of a glorious era. Ah, ah, dear Beijing, a glorious and brilliant city! We live in your embrace; you are deeply hidden in our hearts.

    II. A city inlaid with gold and jade, red light dyes the mountains west of the city, silver smoke like springs gushing towards the blue sky. Opening cannons sound the gongs and drums of steel seizing, red peonies bloom in Shijingshan. Heroes smelt molten steel and iron, like a red waterfall flying down the plains. Ah, Beijing, you are a city of steel; the drums of the Great Leap Forward urge on the spring. Black gold is endless, trains come and go in the coal sea and coal mountains. Looking far at the foot of the Nine Dragon Mountains in western Beijing, cadres personally lead the battle in the depths of the earth's crust. The surging coal flow gushes out of the wellhead, like a rising black horse, a wisp of blue smoke. Ah, Beijing, you are a city of light and heat; you warm the hearts of 600 million people. Cloisonné finely inlaid into golden dragons searching, city communes depict phoenixes dancing gracefully. Ah, Beijing, you are a city inlaid with gold and jade; you are the most solemn and wealthy palace in the world.

    III. The land of Beijing, a blue sky, shrouded in a sea of rice and wheat; colorful rosy clouds, reflecting cotton like silver stars. In the vast vegetable fields, emerald green vegetables are like jade; on the wide pastures, grazing herds of pigs and cattle. Every inch of Beijing's land is the base of our lives; the harvest of each season gives us abundant products. The Party calls on us to seize grain; workers and students have become sharp soldiers, rushing to the forefront of production, plowing the fertile black soil in rotation. Ah, the heart of the motherland, glorious and great Beijing, the beating of your pulse is linked to our destiny. Ah, the heart of the motherland, glorious and great Beijing, under the sunshine of the Party, your land is as beautiful as flowers.

    IV. Dear Party, Beijing, ah, you have the tranquility of the Summer Palace, the dignity of Tiananmen, the grandeur of the Great Hall of the People, the capacity of the Miyun Reservoir. Who gave you such noble character? It is our most beloved Party. Take a piece of Beijing's soil, and it will always be fragrant even if you go to the ends of the earth; drink a cup of Beijing's spring water, and it will still feel cool even after three or five years. What makes us so happy? It is Chairman Mao's rain and sunshine. Beijing, ah, you have spread your golden wings, flying towards the peak of communism. We are striving to seize steel and grain, to dress you up for your youth. What rosy clouds make you radiant? It is the three red flags flying in the rising sun.

  膀，向共产主义的高峰飞翔，我们正在力夺钢粮，为你的青春梳妆。是什么彩霞使你容光焕发？是三面红旗在旭日里飘扬。
