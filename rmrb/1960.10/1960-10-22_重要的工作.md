    Important Work
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, many industries have transferred labor saved through technological innovation and improved labor organization to support key factories and mines such as steel, iron, and coal, or to strengthen the front lines of production. This is an extremely good thing.
    The majority of these workers who have taken on new jobs are full of vigor and are preparing to contribute their strength to the new positions, holding a sense of honor and responsibility for supporting key areas and strengthening the front lines. However, they are, after all, a new force, and they are not yet accustomed to the new production and living environment, and they will encounter some difficulties. How can we enable them to adapt to the new living environment as quickly as possible, master production technology, and achieve "ideological integration" and "entry into production"? On the one hand, these comrades are required to establish the idea of settling down in the new environment, work hard, and learn with an open mind, so as to quickly familiarize themselves with unfamiliar things. On the other hand, leading cadres of factories and mines are required to deeply understand their ideological, production, and living conditions, and help them solve problems and overcome difficulties in a timely manner, so that they can quickly master new production technologies and give full play to their role in production as soon as possible. The practices of the Nantong, Yutianpu, and Tianfu coal mines in Chongqing are good. All units that have newly received manpower support should do this work well.

    重要的工作
    在增产节约运动中，许多行业把通过革新技术和改善劳动组织节约出来的劳动力增援钢、铁、煤等重点厂矿或加强生产第一线。这是一件极大的好事。
    这批走上新的工作岗位的职工，大都抱着支援重点、加强第一线的光荣感和责任感，朝气勃勃地准备在新的岗位上贡献自己的力量。但是，他们毕竟是一支新的队伍，对新的生产环境和生活环境，一时还不习惯，也会遇到一些困难。如何使他们尽快地适应新的生活环境，掌握生产技术，做到“思想入伍”“生产入门”呢？这一方面要求这些同志树立在新环境里安家落户的思想，埋头苦干，虚心学习，把不熟悉的东西迅速熟悉起来；另一方面，要求厂矿领导干部深入地了解他们的思想和生产、生活情况，及时帮助他们解决问题，克服困难，以便使他们迅速掌握新的生产技术，尽快地在生产上充分发挥作用。重庆南桐、鱼田堡、天府等煤矿的做法是好的。凡是新得到人力支援的单位，都要做好这件工作。
