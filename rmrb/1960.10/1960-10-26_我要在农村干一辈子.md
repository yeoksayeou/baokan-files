I Want to Work in the Countryside for the Rest of My Life
Zhang Dunzhi, Production Team Leader, Third Branch, Datong Lake Farm, Honghu County, Hubei Province

Under the Party's kind cultivation, I have grown from a high school graduate into a cadre of the Datong Lake Farm. Going from the city to the countryside, from a middle school student to a farm cadre, was the result of ideological struggle.

In 1958, I was very depressed because I failed to get into university. At that time, I thought that only going to university could lead to a promising future, so I did not respond to the Party's calls for going up to the mountains and down to the countryside several times. Later, under the education of the Communist Youth League Committee and the teachers, I realized that participating in agricultural construction was a very important task, so I signed up and left prosperous Shanghai for Honghu County, Hubei Province.

When I first arrived at Datong Lake Farm, the farm's Party committee was very concerned about us, and the farm's workers patiently taught us how to produce. I followed these teachers and learned how to sow, thin seedlings, weed, fertilize, apply pesticides, and prune branches. The farm workers' selfless dedication deeply educated me; I remember in August 1958, the Neijing River flooded and broke the dam, seriously threatening the farm. The workers bravely jumped into the rushing water to block the breach. I was very touched and jumped in too, and finally we blocked the breach. Last winter, I participated in the lake management project, leading a platoon to fight in the freezing cold. In the sub-zero four-degree cold, I insisted on working even with several cuts on my feet. Because the workers were so enthusiastic, our platoon was able to complete its tasks every time. After the project was completed, I was awarded the title of Special-Class Labor Model and participated in the county's labor model conference.

In February of this year, the leaders promoted me to be the production team leader. Our production team mainly engages in diversified operations, especially animal husbandry. At the beginning, there were no pigsties, and the pigs we raised became "wild pigs." I went to the leaders, and they asked me to discuss it with the masses. The masses immediately collected a lot of waste materials and built them themselves. I didn't know how to build, but the workers taught me, and finally we built two large pigsties. The breeder and I also moved to live next to the pigsties, found the pigs that had run into the lake, and carried out "five separations" (size, strength, male and female, sick pigs, pregnant pigs) and "five cleans" (pig body, trough, pigsty, drinking water, feed). We made sure that the feed was a combination of coarse and fine, and that the coarse feed was finely processed and the fine feed was refined. Our pigs grew from twenty-three to more than sixty in half a year, and they all grew very well. Every time I saw them, I felt unspeakable joy.

Someone once asked me if I wanted to leave the farm? Indeed, I used to mistakenly think that there was no future in the countryside and had the idea of leaving it. But now I don't want to leave the farm at all. How can I bear to give up the cause I have created with my own hands? How can I leave my leaders and comrades-in-arms, and how can I leave that big red-maned horse and that cute little calf? My work may seem ordinary, but it is very important work. This is my home, and I want to live and fight here for the rest of my life. (Attached picture)

### 我要在农村干一辈子

    我要在农村干一辈子
    湖北洪湖县大同湖农场三分场生产队长  张敦智
    在党的亲切培养下，我由一个高中毕业生，成长为大同湖农场的干部。由城市到农村，由中学生成为农场干部，是经过了思想斗争的。
    1958年，因没考取大学，思想上非常苦闷。当时认为只有升大学才有前途，因此党几次发出上山下乡的号召，我都没有响应。后来在团委和老师的教育下，认识到参加农业建设是十分重要的任务，我才报了名，离开繁华的上海到湖北的洪湖县来。
    初到大同湖农场，农场的党委非常关怀我们，农场的工人耐心地教我们学习生产，我跟着这些老师学会了播种、间苗、锄草、施肥、打药、整枝。农场工人们忘我劳动的崇高品质深深教育了我；记得1958年8月内荆河发水冲破了堤，农场遭到严重威胁，工人们奋不顾身首先跳进激流堵口，我十分感动，也跟着跳下去，终于堵住了缺口。去冬，我参加了治湖工程，领导一个排战斗在冰天雪地里，零下四度的严寒中，脚上扎了几个口子也坚持着干，由于工人们干劲冲天，我们这个排每次都能完成任务，工程结束后我被评为特等劳动模范，参加了县劳模大会。
    今年2月，领导提拔我当生产队长。我们生产队主要是搞多种经营，特别是畜牧。开头没有猪圈，喂的猪都成了“野猪”，我去找领导，领导要我找群众商量，群众一动手就搜集了许多废料，自己动手盖，我不会盖，工人教我，终于造了两幢大猪圈，我和饲养员也都搬到猪圈旁边住，把跑到湖里的猪找回来，进行“五分”（大小、强弱、公母、病猪、孕猪）、“五净”（猪身、食槽、猪圈、食水、食料），饲料做到粗细搭配，粗料细作，细料精做。我们的猪半年内就从二十三头发展到六十多头，都长得很好，我每次看了心里就有说不出的愉快。
    曾有人问我想不想离开农场？的确，从前我曾错误地认为在农村没前途，有离开它的念头。但现在我一点也不想离开农场了。我怎能舍得亲手创造的事业呢？怎能离得开我的领导和战友，又怎能离得开那匹大红鬃马和那条可爱的小牛呢？我的工作看来平凡，但却是很重要的工作。这里就是我的家，我要一辈子生活战斗在这里。（附图片）
