Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement at a press conference held here this morning, strongly condemning the United States for continuing and intensifying its illegal act of shipping war materials into South Vietnam. The statement said that this is "part of the overall U.S. war preparation plan in South Vietnam," which is being recklessly accelerated and is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords.

The statement said that on September 22, several "AS65 type" naval fighter-bombers and engines for this type of aircraft arrived in Saigon aboard the U.S. escort aircraft carrier "Breton." According to U.S. officials in Saigon, this is the first batch of a series of new fighter jets supplied by the United States to the South Vietnamese Air Force.

The statement, released by Lieutenant Colonel Mai Lin, Deputy Head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission in Vietnam, said: "Vietnamese public opinion expresses concern and anger at the U.S.'s blatant increase in military aid advisors and warships to the South Vietnamese army, and the shipping of many new military aircraft into South Vietnam."

The statement went on to reveal that since the restoration of peace until June 1960, U.S. imperialism shipped 643 batches of different types of weapons and war materials into South Vietnam. The number of South Vietnamese regular troops equipped with new U.S.-made weapons reached more than 150,000. More than 100 U.S. military aircraft have been supplied to the South Vietnamese Air Force. A U.S. Air Force Task Force is constantly active in South Vietnam. Since the restoration of peace, the number of military airfields has increased to 56. A large number of South Vietnamese officers have been sent to the United States for aviation technology training, and the United States is also preparing to supply the South Vietnamese Air Force with jet aircraft and is preparing to ship rockets and atomic weapons into South Vietnam. A very complete network of U.S. arms depots has been established in South Vietnam.

The statement also pointed out that while shipping modern U.S. weapons and war materials into South Vietnam, the number of U.S. military personnel stationed in South Vietnam has also increased. The number of illegally stationed U.S. military organization – the Military Assistance Advisory Group – has increased tenfold compared to before the ceasefire.

The statement emphasized: "The shipping of U.S. military materials and military personnel is being carried out simultaneously with the intensification of the establishment of military bases, especially in the Saigon area and the highlands, which is linked to the U.S. and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military base network in Thailand."

The statement said that the U.S. and the South Vietnamese authorities' shipping in of U.S. weapons and intensifying of war preparations not only seriously violate the Geneva Accords, but are also a brazen provocation against the Vietnamese people and a threat to peace in Indochina, especially at a time when the situation in Laos and South Vietnam is generally tense due to U.S. intervention. The above situation also exposes the malicious conspiracy of U.S. imperialists to create tension in this region of the world.

The statement continued: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army and the Vietnamese people strongly condemn the above-mentioned conspiracies and violations of the agreement by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities. They resolutely oppose any U.S. interference in South Vietnam and oppose obstructing the cause of the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese people's country. The Vietnam International Commission should take active measures to stop U.S. interference in South Vietnam and recommend that the South Vietnamese authorities immediately reship the illegally shipped military materials and cease similar violations of the agreement.

After releasing the above statement, Lieutenant Colonel Mai Lin also listed a large number of facts exposing the crimes of the U.S. and South Vietnam in expanding their military and preparing for war. He pointed out that for six years, on average, a ship (trip) has shipped war materials to South Vietnam every three or four days; especially in April 1960, there were 29 ships (trips), which means that every day U.S. ships shipped weapons and war materials to various ports in South Vietnam.

In addition, more than 700 aircraft (trips) have shipped weapons and U.S. military personnel to South Vietnam.

Mai Lin pointed out that, to date, the U.S. has shipped hundreds of thousands of tons of ammunition and weapons to South Vietnam, as well as more than 130 various fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, and transport planes.

Lieutenant Colonel Mai Lin emphasized that the U.S.-Ngo clique's conspiracy to prepare for war in South Vietnam is a comprehensive conspiracy, the purpose of which is to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and a military base for provocations in the Southeast Asian region.

    越南人民军总司令部发表声明
    谴责美国加紧把战争物资运入越南南方
    指出美国的备战活动威胁印度支那和平
    新华社河内10日电　越南人民军总司令部今天上午在这里举行的记者招待会上发表一项声明，强烈谴责美国继续和加紧把战争物资运入越南南方的非法行为。声明说，这是正在肆无忌惮地加速执行中的“美国在越南南方的全面备战计划的一部分”，是严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。
    声明说，9月22日，若干架“AS65型”海军战斗轰炸机和这种类型的飞机所用的引擎，由美国护航航空母舰“布列托斯”号运抵西贡。据在西贡的美国官方人士说，这是美国供给越南南方空军的一系列新式战斗机中的第一批。
    由越南人民军驻越南国际委员会联络代表团副团长梅林中校公布的这项声明说：“越南舆论对于美国公然为越南南方军队增派军事援助顾问团的军事人员和军舰，并且把许多新式军用飞机运入越南南方的行动表示不安和愤怒。”
    声明接着揭露，自从恢复和平到1960年6月，美帝国主义把六百四十三批不同类型的武器和战争物资运进越南南方。用美制新武器装备的越南南方正规军人数达十五万人之多。已经供给越南南方空军的美国军用飞机有一百多架。美国空军特遣队经常在越南南方进行活动。自从恢复和平以来，军用飞机场已增至五十六个。大批越南南方的军官被送往美国受航空技术的训练，美国还准备供给越南南方空军以喷气式飞机，并且正在准备把火箭和原子武器运进越南南方。在越南南方已经建立起十分完备的美国军火仓库网。
    声明还指出，在把现代化美国武器和战争物资运入越南南方的同时，派驻越南南方的美国军事人员也增加了。非法派驻的美国军事组织——军事援助顾问团的人数，已增为停火前的十倍。
    声明强调说：“运入美国军事物资和军事人员是同加紧建立军事基地，特别是在西贡一边和地区和高原地区加紧建立军事基地同时进行的，这是同美国和东南亚条约组织在泰国的军事基地网联在一起的。”
    声明说，美国和越南南方当局运入美国武器和加紧进行备战活动，不仅严重地违反日内瓦协议，也是对越南人民的无耻的挑衅行为和对印度支那和平的威胁，尤其是在由于美国干涉老挝和越南南方形势普遍紧张的时刻。上述情况也暴露了美帝国主义者在世界这一地区制造紧张局势的恶毒阴谋。
    声明接着说：越南人民军总司令部和越南人民强烈谴责美国和越南南方当局的上述阴谋和违反协定的行为。他们坚决反对美国对越南南方的任何干涉，反对阻挠越南人民和平地重新统一国家的事业。越南国际委员会应当采取积极措施来制止美国对越南南方的干涉，并建议越南南方当局立即重新运出非法运入的军事物资和停止类似的违反协议的行动。
    梅林中校在公布了上述声明之后，还列举大量事实揭露美国和越南南方扩军备战的罪行。他指出，六年来，平均每三天或四天就有一艘船（次）向越南南方运进战争物资；特别是在1960年4月份就有二十九艘船（次），也就是说每天都有美国轮船把武器和战争物资运进越南南方各个港口。
    此外，还有七百多架（次）飞机向越南南方运进武器和美国军事人员。
    梅林指出，到目前为止，美国运进越南南方的弹药武器已达数十万吨，还有一百三十多架各种战斗机、侦察机和运输机等。
    梅林中校强调指出，美吴集团在越南南方准备战争的阴谋，是一个全面的阴谋，它的目的是把越南南方变成美国的殖民地和在东南亚地区进行挑战的军事基地。
