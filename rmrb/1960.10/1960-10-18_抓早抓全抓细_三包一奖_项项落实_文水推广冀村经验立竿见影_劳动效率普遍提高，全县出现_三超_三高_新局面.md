Following the publication of the Shanxi Daily article on October 5th, which conveyed the experience of Ji Village Management Area of the FenYang Happiness Commune in implementing and calculating the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, the WenShui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately convened a county committee meeting. They seriously studied the article, focusing on the current situation and problems in implementing "Three Guarantees and One Reward" throughout the county. They decided that cadres at all levels of communes, districts, and teams across the county should organize the study and promotion of the Ji Village experience. Through vigorous efforts in the trial calculation of "Three Guarantees and One Reward," the broad masses are mobilized to participate in the management and operation of the People's Communes, ensuring the fulfillment of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward".

In order to properly manage this year's autumn harvest distribution work, in mid-September, the WenShui County Committee organized inspection teams to delve into various management areas. These teams examined the situation of production estimation, as well as the experiences and problems in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. The inspection revealed that some management areas had not yet conducted trial calculations for the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan; in some management areas, the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" policy had not been communicated to the broad masses; and in the areas of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" appeared to be a mere formality. In particular, some cadres and the masses still had many concerns about implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. For example, some cadres believed that there were many problems with implementing "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and that it would be difficult to resolve them, so they made excuses not to implement it resolutely; some over-producing teams feared that the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" would not be honored; and some under-producing teams feared being penalized for reduced production; and so on. To address this, the WenShui County Committee used the Ji Village Management Area and management areas within the county that had successfully implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system over the years as examples, while also establishing negative examples. They criticized the incorrect perceptions of some cadres, so that the commune members would establish confidence in the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward." On the basis of raising the awareness and unifying the thinking of cadres and the masses, the county committee, led by the First Secretary Chang Zhenhua, focused on fourteen management areas, including Beijie of the Qianjin Commune, which had consistently implemented "Three Guarantees and One Reward" effectively over the years. By using the method of dissecting a sparrow, experiences were explored to guide the overall effort.

In promoting the Ji Village experience and implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward," WenShui County generally paid attention to three key aspects: early, comprehensive, and meticulous.

First, grasp early. That is, the autumn harvest trial calculation plan is announced early; and the "Three Guarantees" plan for next year is formulated early. According to the requirement of fulfilling grain rations, cash, and over-production rewards, 87% of the management areas in the county have already conducted trial calculations of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan down to the team level. In most management areas, the labor work points of commune members have already been cleared and announced once. In order to promote production preparations for next year, the county committee proposed to change the past habit of formulating the "Three Guarantees" plan in the spring and to formulate the "Three Guarantees" plan for next year as early as possible after the autumn harvest. At present, in some management areas, work has already begun, with autumn harvest and the formulation of the "Three Guarantees" plan for next year proceeding simultaneously.

Second, grasp comprehensively. While implementing "Three Guarantees and One Reward" in agriculture, all localities also carefully examined the past situation of production quotas for forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Many areas only contracted for agriculture, without fully implementing "Three Guarantees" for forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Even in some units that had contracted, it was only a formality. Therefore, the county committee decided that areas that had not implemented "Three Guarantees" in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should quickly implement them. Those that had already implemented "Three Guarantees" should formulate trial calculation and fulfillment plans as soon as possible.

Third, grasp meticulously. While conducting trial calculations of "Three Guarantees and One Reward," each management area also discussed and resolved some specific issues in the overall distribution work. The masses were mobilized to thoroughly understand the seven basic facts: production, income, work points, investment, disaster situation, changes in crop planting, and labor allocation; cleared the three accounts: income and expenditure, work points and investment, and over-production and under-production; and distinguished the situations of over-production, normal production, under-production, and commune members completing their labor days. This laid the foundation for implementing "Three Guarantees and One Reward."

Through the trial calculation and publicity and discussion work of "Three Guarantees and One Reward," the production enthusiasm of production teams and commune members has been greatly boosted. Throughout the county, a new situation of "Three Exceeds" and "Three Highs" has been further developed, with "measures exceeding targets, actual production exceeding quotas, and labor exceeding norms"; and "high labor morale, high attendance efficiency, and high quality of work." The number of commune members attending work has increased by 15% compared to July, and labor efficiency has also generally improved. Every commune member is concerned about the autumn harvest and offers suggestions for increasing production and income. Commune members across the county have put forward more than 1,700 rationalization proposals related to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. (Attached Picture)

    抓早抓全抓细　“三包一奖”项项落实
    文水推广冀村经验立竿见影
    劳动效率普遍提高，全县出现　“三超”“三高”新局面
    本报讯　10月5日，山西日报发表了中共山西省委批转的汾阳幸福公社冀村管理区执行“三包一奖”兑现试算的经验后，中共文水县委立即召开县委会议，认真学习了这篇文章，集中研究了当前全县执行“三包一奖”的情况和问题，并作出决定，要求全县各社、区、队干部层层组织学习推广冀村经验。通过大抓“三包一奖”试算工作，发动广大群众参加人民公社的经营管理，保证“三包一奖”兑现。
    为了做好今年的秋收分配工作，9月中旬，文水县委就组织了检查团，深入各管理区检查了估产情况，和执行“三包一奖”的经验和问题。在检查中发现，有部分管理区的“三包一奖”试算方案还未进行；有些管理区的“三包一奖”政策没有和广大群众见面；在林、牧、副、渔方面的“三包一奖”有流于形式的现象。特别是部分干部和群众，对执行“三包一奖”制度还有不少顾虑，如有的干部认为执行“三包一奖”问题很多，不好解决，因此找借口不坚决执行，有的超产队怕“三包一奖”不兑现；一些减产队则怕减产受罚；等等。为此，文水县委以冀村管理区和本县历年执行“三包一奖”制度好的管理区为镜子，并树立了对立面，批判了一些干部的不正确认识，使社员群众树立了执行“三包一奖”的信念。在干部、群众提高认识统一思想的基础上，由县委第一书记常振华同志挂帅，全县以前进公社北街等十四个历年来执行“三包一奖”好的管理区为重点，用解剖麻雀的办法，摸索经验，指导全面。
    文水县在推广冀村经验推行“三包一奖”的工作中，普遍注意了早、全、细三个字。
    第一是抓早。即：秋收试算方案早公布；明年“三包”方案早制定。根据口粮、现金、超产奖励三兑现的要求，全县已有87％的管理区把“三包一奖”方案试算到队，全县大部管理区对社员的劳动工分已经进行了一次清理公布。为了促进明年的生产准备，县委提出要改变过去春季制定“三包”方案的习惯，在秋收后就及早制定明年“三包”方案。目前，在部分管理区，已经开始着手，一边秋收，一边制定明年“三包”方案。
    第二是抓全。在农业方面执行“三包一奖”的同时，各地还认真检查了过去对林牧副业的包产情况；不少地区只包了农业，而没有对林牧副全面实行“三包”，有些包了的单位也是流于形式。因此，县委决定，林、牧、副、渔没有实行“三包”的迅速包起来，已经
  “三包”的，及早制定试算兑现方案。
    第三是抓细。各管理区进行“三包一奖”试算的同时，对于整个分配工作中的一些具体问题，也进行了讨论解决。发动群众普遍摸清了产量、收入、工分、投资、灾情、作物种植变化、劳力调配七个底；清算了收入支出、工分投资、超产减产三笔账；划清了超产、平产、减产和社员完成劳动日等情况。为贯彻“三包一奖”打下了基础。
    通过“三包一奖”试算和宣传讨论工作，大大鼓舞了生产队和社员的生产积极性，在全县范围内进一步开展了“措施超指标，实产超包产，劳动超定额”；“劳动情绪高，出勤效率高，做活质量高”的三超三高新局面，社员出勤人数较7月间增加了15％，劳动效率也普遍提高。社员人人为三秋操心，人人为增产增收出主意，全县社员提出有关精收细打的合理化建议就有一千七百多条。（附图片）
