    The Era of People's Victory
    Jin Zhonghua
    Whenever the festival of the birth of New China arrives, and many friends from all over the world come to our country to visit and celebrate the festival with us, we often think of Chairman Mao's words: "Our friends are all over the world." Over the past eleven years, these words have increasingly shown their profound significance and have taken on richer and more vivid content.
    Many friends come from countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, separated by mountains and oceans. Some countries have only recently gained independence, while others are still in the process of striving for independence. They are all waging persistent struggles against the aggression and oppression of imperialists and colonialists. When these friends meet us, they always enthusiastically tell us that as soon as they set foot on the land of New China, they feel an infinite sense of kinship. Wherever they go and whoever they meet in New China, whether men, women, old, or young, they all have smiles on their faces. They have personally witnessed that all the changes are so rapid, the old traces are quickly disappearing, and new things are growing vigorously. New factories, new cities, new people, new lives, new customs – they talk about all this with even more warmth and enthusiasm than we ourselves do. These are by no means mere polite words, but rather expressions of genuine feelings and experiences.
    This situation is not accidental. Because, in the final analysis, the Chinese people's struggle is a part of the struggle of the people of the world, and our victory is also the common victory of the people of all countries. The liberation of the Chinese people, who account for nearly a quarter of the world's population, cannot but have a significant impact on the destiny of mankind. Moreover, the historical paths traversed by the Chinese people and the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries are very similar!
    Friends talk to us without reservation about what they have seen and heard in China. Some have the flavor of wandering through a wonderland, yet it is a living reality. They have seen that the Yellow River, which has caused disasters for thousands of years, has begun to be tamed and serve the people; the bridge spanning the Yangtze River has connected the north and south arteries of China. They are particularly interested in Shanghai, because it originally resembled many of their cities. How to turn the former "ten-mile foreign concessions," the den of iniquity, into a true paradise for the cultural rest of the working people? From the shack areas like Fangua Lane and Yaoshui Lane to the new workers' villages like Caoyang New Village and Siping New Village, and then to the industrial satellite cities like Minhang and Zhangmiao, they seem to have seen a miniature picture of New China's great changes in just a few years, changes that span centuries. Some modern large factories are built entirely with China's own materials and designs; at the same time, there are also many simple lane factories with years of simple equipment, which suddenly blossomed in the mass technical innovation and technical revolution, and their faces are completely renewed. They are particularly impressed by the fact that the most ordinary housewives, who have always been considered the most ordinary, have broken through their original small world and have shown their skills, giving full play to their wisdom and creativity in the people's communes and new collective organizations for production.
    In the conversation, I often think about what it is that connects our feelings together. Now I understand that it is our common experience in the common struggle. When the people truly gain independence and liberation, how great a force they can unleash! Equally rich land, hardworking and brave people, and equally subjected to years of bullying and oppression by imperialists, our destinies are the same. Friends say, if the Chinese people can do it, why can't others? Yes, that is why they feel particularly close when they step on the land of New China, and that is what they see in the smiles of the people of New China: confidence and strength.
    Now, the imperialists are encountering increasingly large storms from all sides of the world. They are rushing around like stray dogs, watching as the colonial edifice, built on the bones of slaves for many years, is about to collapse. However, US imperialism is peddling another set of gangster theories, saying that when the old colonialists are driven away, it should "fill the vacuum," otherwise the people in these places will not be able to survive. This habitual trickster and plunderer, the head of imperialism, is rushing to throw out US dollars with chains and even brought the United Nations flag stained with blood in the Korean War, trying to drag the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are standing up to fight, back into its neo-colonialist net.
    US imperialism is the world's largest "negative teacher" today. The Chinese people have learned enough about its tricks. When Japanese imperialism was driven away, didn't US imperialism also run over with the banner of "filling the vacuum"? What good things did it do? It used billions of US dollars to support the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, instructed him to launch an anti-people civil war, allowed the US Air Force and Navy to occupy many places in China, and overwhelmed China's little national industry with the rampant "US aid" surplus materials. This painful lesson is still fresh in everyone's memory. Now, the Chinese people and all our friends realize that the tremendous achievements of New China's construction over the past eleven years have been achieved precisely on the basis of driving away US imperialism.
    Where imperialism is, the people cannot survive; when imperialism is driven away, the people can live better. As long as the people control their own destiny, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles lie ahead, they will certainly be able to build a better new life. This is the most important lesson of our time.
    The Chinese people have learned this truth from their own revolutionary and construction struggles. The people of the world are also increasingly understanding this truth. Now, in all aspects of the world, more and more people are rising up to fight against US imperialism and its running dogs. This spring, in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, anti-imperialist storms erupted one after another like volcanoes, overthrowing the running dogs of US imperialism one by one. At present, in Cuba, Congo, and Laos, the tide of struggle is still surging and rising. We Chinese people resolutely support these struggles of the people of all countries, and we believe that these struggles are also a support for the struggle of the Chinese people. We are comrades-in-arms on the same road, and we will always support each other.
    The imperialists are facing the sorrow of their doomsday. They are panicking and struggling frantically. US imperialism is acting as the last pillar of the world's reactionary forces, desperately propping up some crumbling puppets with bayonets and gold yuan, and buying up batches of overthrown dictators and political dregs. However, none of their threats and deceptions can shake the fighting will of the people of all countries. Let it dance the devil's dance with those political zombies! Let it cry with those overthrown reactionaries of all countries! The people have seen clearly that the lives of imperialism and its running dogs will not be too long.
    This year is the first year of the great 1960s. After traversing the victorious road of the first decade, the Chinese people are once again happily meeting their great festival. The three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are waving higher and higher in the east wind. Friends all over the world are happy for our victory, and we are also happy for the victorious advance of the people of all countries in their struggles.
    The current situation is infinitely good. The socialist countries, the national democratic movement, and the peace-loving people of the world are further uniting to form the broadest united front and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. The victorious east wind is blowing stronger and stronger! Let imperialism and its running dogs tremble in the bleak west wind!

    人民胜利的时代
    金仲华
    每当新中国诞生的节日来临，许多来自世界各地的朋友到我国参观访问，同我们共度节日的时候，我们常常会想起毛主席的一句话：我们的朋友遍于全世界。十一年来，这句话越来越显出了它的深长意义，而且有了更丰富的生动内容。
    许多朋友来自远隔重山和大洋的亚、非、拉丁美洲国家。有些国家是获得独立不久的，有些还在争取独立的过程中，它们都在对帝国主义，殖民主义者的侵略压迫进行着坚持不懈的斗争。当这些朋友同我们见面时，总是热情地告诉我们：他们一踏上新中国的土地，就有着无限亲切的感觉。他们所到之处，接触新中国的人民，无论男女老幼，都是脸有笑容。他们亲眼看到，一切的变化是那么快，旧的痕迹在迅速地消逝，新的东西在蓬勃地生长。新的工厂、新的城市、新的人物、新的生活、新的风气——这一切，他们谈起来甚至会比我们自己更加亲切有味。这些绝非泛泛的客套话，而是出自真情实感的体会。
    这种情况，并不是偶然的。因为，归根到底，中国人民的斗争是世界人民斗争的一部分，我们的胜利也就是世界各国人民的共同胜利。占世界人口将近四分之一的中国人民的解放，对人类命运不能不发生重大的影响。何况中国人民和亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民所经过的历史道路，又是十分相同的呢！
    朋友们和我们在一起，毫无拘束地谈着他们在中国的见闻。有些漫游奇境的味道，而又是活生生的现实。他们看到，千年成灾的黄河，已经开始被驯服起来，为人民服务了；跨越长江的大桥，已经把中国南北的脉络沟通起来。他们对上海特别感到兴趣，因为这里原来同他们的许多城市相仿佛的。怎样把过去的十里洋场罪恶渊薮的大世界，变成劳动人民文化休息的真正乐园呢？从蕃瓜弄、药水弄这些棚户区，到曹杨新村、四平新村之类的工人新村，再到闵行、张庙等工业卫星城市，他们似乎看到了新中国在短短几年间跨过了上百年那样大变化的一幅缩影图。有些现代化的大工厂，完全是用中国自己的材料和设计建造起来的；同时，却也有多年简陋设备的弄堂工厂，忽然在群众大闹技术革新和技术革命中开了花，面目焕然一新了。他们特别感到有意味的是，一向被认为最平凡的家庭妇女，一朝冲破了原来的小天地，竟会在人民公社和组织生产的新集体中显出了身手，充分发挥了智慧和创造力。
    在谈话中，我常常想着是什么东西使我们的感情这样连系在一起的。现在我明白了，是我们在共同斗争中的共同体会。当人民真正获得了独立解放时，他们能够发挥出多么伟大的力量来啊！同样富饶的土地、勤劳而勇敢的人民，又同样受到帝国主义者多年的欺凌压迫，我们的命运是相同的。朋友们说，中国人民能够做到的，为什么别人不能够呢？是的，这就是他们踏上了新中国的土地时感到特别亲切的由来，也就是他们从新中国人民的笑容里看到的信心和力量。
    现在，帝国主义者正遭到世界各方面越来越大的风暴。他们急急如丧家之犬，眼看着多年来用奴隶的白骨架起来的殖民地大厦，快要倒塌完了。但是，美帝国主义却在贩卖又一套强盗理论，说什么老殖民主义者被赶走了，就应该由它来“填补真空”，否则这些地方的人民就活不下去。这个惯于巧取豪夺的帝国主义头子，正在急忙忙地抛出带有链索的美元，甚至搬来了在侵朝战争中沾满血污的联合国旗帜，企图把站立起来斗争的亚、非、拉丁美洲人民，重新拖进它的新殖民主义的罗网。
    美帝国主义是当今世界上最大的“反面教员”。对于它的一套，中国人民是领教够了的。就在日本帝国主义被赶走的时候，美帝国主义不是也打起“填补真空”的牌子跑来吗？它干了些什么好事呢？用几十亿美元支撑蒋介石傀儡政权，指使他发动反人民的内战，让美国海空军霸占了中国许多地方，把泛滥的“美援”剩余物资压塌了中国仅有的一点民族工业。这惨痛的一课，大家还记忆犹新。现在，中国人民和我们所有的朋友们都认识到，十一年来新中国建设的巨大成就，正是在赶走了美帝国主义的基础上取得的。
    帝国主义在这里，人民就活不下去；把帝国主义赶走了，人民才能生活得更好。只要人民掌握了自己的命运，不管前面有多少困难险阻，就一定能把美好的新生活建设起来的。这是我们时代最重要的一课。
    中国人民从自己的革命和建设斗争中，学会了这个道理。全世界人民也越来越懂得了这个道理。现在，在世界各方面，越来越多的人民起来对美帝国主义和它的走狗斗争了。今年春天，在南朝鲜、土耳其、日本，反帝风暴像火山一样接连爆发，把美帝国主义的走狗一个个打倒了。目前，在古巴、刚果、老挝，斗争的浪潮还在风起云涌，不断高涨。我们中国人民坚决支持各国人民的这些斗争，我们认为这些斗争也是对于中国人民斗争的支持。我们是一条道路上的战友，我们永远是相互支持的。
    帝国主义者面临着末日的悲哀。他们一面惊慌失措，一面在疯狂挣扎。美帝国主义充当着世界反动势力的最后支柱，它拼命用刺刀和金元撑持着一些摇摇欲倒的傀儡，收买着一批批被人民打倒的独裁头子和政治渣滓。但是，它们的任何威胁和欺骗都动摇不了各国人民的斗争意志。让它同那些政治僵尸去作魔鬼的跳舞吧！让它同那些被推翻的各国反动派去抱头痛哭吧！人民已看得清清楚楚，帝国主义和它的走狗的寿命不会太长了。
    今年是伟大六十年代的第一年。中国人民在走过第一个十年的胜利道路之后，又欣逢自己的伟大节日。六亿五千万人民在欢庆新的一年中的新胜利。总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗，迎着东风招展，举得更高了。全世界的朋友为我们的胜利高兴，我们也为世界各国人民正在斗争中胜利前进而高兴。
    当前形势无限好。社会主义国家、民族民主运动和全世界爱好和平的人民正在进一步团结起来，结成最广泛的统一战线，对帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。胜利的东风越吹越有劲了！让帝国主义及其走狗在萧瑟的西风里发抖吧！
