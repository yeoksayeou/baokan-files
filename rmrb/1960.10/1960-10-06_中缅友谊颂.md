    Ode to Sino-Burmese Friendship
    Xiao Xiangrong
      I. Sino-Burmese orchids bloom splendidly, "Paukphaw" travel thousands of miles without hesitation; in the grand hall, a state banquet rewards the honored guests, mutually wishing prosperity, we raise our cups together.
      II. Sino-Burmese friendship is a thousand years deep, continuing through dynasties to this day; now we further determine peaceful border policies, never forgetting this shared commitment for ten thousand generations.
    III. Our two nations' leaders wisely established the Five Principles, to which the hearts of the people return; and now, as the grand edifice is newly completed, another banner is raised amidst the world's disputes.
      IV. Soldiers of our two nations frequently visit each other, good neighborliness and friendship are as weighty as mountains; rugged cliffs have been transformed into smooth and prosperous roads, the flower marks on our clothes replace bloodstains.

    中缅友谊颂
    萧向荣
      一中缅琼花烂漫开，“胞波”千里不辞来；华堂国宴酬佳客，互祝繁荣竞举杯。
      二中缅千年友谊深，经朝历代到如今；如今更决和边策，万世无忘共此心。
    三两国英明创五基，和平共处众心归；而今大厦新成日，举世纷纭又一旗。
      四两国戎装频往还，睦邻友戚义如山；巉岩已筑平康路，衣上花痕替血斑。
