An Achievement in China's Desert Control Science
Zhu Jifan, Director of the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Li Minggang, Associate Researcher

The Baolan Railway (Baotou to Lanzhou), connecting North China and Northwest China, originally took the northern route from Lanzhou to Yinchuan because the southern route from Shuiquan to Daying on the south bank of the Yellow River was prone to earthquakes. However, this required crossing the Tengger Desert six times, extending the route by 40 kilometers. The section with the most undulating sand dunes was the Shapotou area in the west of Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, stretching for 16 kilometers. Shapotou was known as a "naked sand dune." Some called it the "Desert Capital of the World." In the past, many people believed it was a naturally barren land, impossible to transform by human effort. Building a railway on these seemingly oceanic dunes was considered unimaginable. Today, with the Chinese people in power, people not only dared to think but also dared to act, and the Baolan Railway finally passed through this vast desert.

Building a railway in the desert was a pioneering feat in China. From an engineering perspective, there was no mature experience at the time. In 1954, the Railway Science Research Institute (now the China Academy of Railway Sciences) conducted roadbed tests near Shapotou, proving that building a desert roadbed was not only possible in engineering terms but also had unique advantages, such as the loose sand, easy construction, economical road building, the fact that the sand is not subject to rain erosion due to lack of runoff, and convenient management, etc. However, to ensure that the tracks were not submerged by sand and to guarantee the safe passage of trains, it was necessary to fix the shifting sands on both sides of the roadbed with plants. To undertake this glorious and arduous task, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the First Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways (now the First Design Institute) and the Railway Science Research Institute, established the Railway Desert Control Research Station in Shapotou in 1956. They conducted research on railway desert control afforestation, carrying out biological and mechanical sand fixation experiments. To meet the needs of socialist construction, they were tasked with completing the research in three years and proposing a technical design plan for railway desert control afforestation. In 1957, the Zhongwei Desert Control Forest Farm was established to carry out large-scale sand fixation and afforestation work.

In the past few years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the enthusiastic and creative labor of the masses, and the joint efforts of the staff, this task has been successfully completed. Trains can now safely travel on this vast desert. Since the railway opened to traffic on August 1, 1958, there has never been a train stoppage accident due to sand damage. The "Yellow Dragon" (local residents call shifting sands "Yellow Dragon"), which has historically plagued the people, has now been tamed, forced to wear green clothes, and transformed its appearance. In 1959, the Ministry of Railways held a desert railway on-site conference in Zhongwei County. Everyone unanimously affirmed the possibility of building railways in the desert and acknowledged the success of sand fixation and afforestation, writing a new page in the history of railway construction.

Shapotou is located in the east of the Tengger Desert, facing the Yellow River in the south. The endless yellow sand resembles waves in the sea. Normally, the shifting sand reaches the waist, making it difficult for people and livestock to travel. During strong winds, sand particles fly, blocking out the sun. The sand grains are constantly moving, and the terrain changes at any time, so that almost no plants grow on the sand dunes. This area belongs to the semi-desert zone, with relatively harsh environmental conditions, dry climate, an average annual rainfall of about 170 millimeters, frequent strong winds, and extreme temperatures, with the sand surface temperature reaching over 70 degrees Celsius. All these meteorological factors are unbearable for most plants. The sand dunes are tall, layered, and covered with shifting sand, up to ten to hundreds of meters thick, on the Triassic purplish-red sandstone interbedded with shale. To fix sand with plants on this shifting sand, which has historically been sparsely vegetated, some people initially did not believe it was possible, thinking it violated natural laws. Relying on the leadership of the Party, we despised difficulties strategically but valued them tactically, and carefully studied the dominant factors controlling plant growth on shifting sand with a pragmatic attitude. After repeated experiments and multiple failures, we finally found a way to grasp the laws of nature to a certain extent.

There are two methods of fixing shifting sand: plant fixation and mechanical fixation. Plant fixation should be the primary method of sand fixation, supplemented by mechanical fixation.

Plant fixation is the most basic, reliable, and permanent method of sand fixation. Once plants grow on shifting sand, its basic properties change, forming fixed sand dunes. In the process of plant fixation, selecting suitable sand-fixing plant species is a key to the success of the work. Desert and semi-desert areas have special environmental conditions that are unfavorable to plant growth. When selecting sand-fixing plants, on the one hand, it is necessary to study the biological and ecological characteristics of the plants. Perennial plants that are drought-resistant, barren-tolerant, wind-resistant, fast-growing, and have well-developed root systems are the best sand-fixing plants. On the other hand, it is necessary to study the succession law of plants in the natural sand fixation process, to identify what are the pioneer plants on shifting sand, that is, the plants that can grow on shifting sand first, and what are the plant species that grow after the pioneer species. There are many kinds of plants, and the sand dune ground conditions are ever-changing. If we do not grasp its laws and seize the main factors, it will be difficult to make plant fixation successful. In the shifting sand of Shapotou, there are many factors that affect plant survival and growth, and the main ones are the following: 1. Water conditions in the sand, 2. The tightness of the sand, 3. The mobility of the sand.

Whether plants can grow in the desert mainly depends on its water conditions. Water in the desert is as precious as gold. Whether it is a desert or a Gobi, where there is water, it can be turned into an oasis. The sand dunes in Shapotou are tall, the sand layer is thick, and the groundwater is buried deep, tens of meters below the surface, and cannot be used by plant roots. Whether there is enough water for plant growth under such dry conditions has become the most important issue, so the study of water measurement has become one of the key projects.

The study of water content shows that: 1. Although the water condition in the desert is poor, it also has its advantages. There is a stable layer of wet sand under the dry sand, and the dry sand can also play a role in water retention, preventing the evaporation of water from the wet sand layer. 2. Although the water content in the sand is low, there is more effective water, because its wilting water content is small. According to the measured figures, the water content of the shifting sand in Shapotou is often 2%-3%, and the wilting water content is 0.7%. It can be seen that the effective water content is often 1.3%-2.3% (that is, the water content minus the wilting water content), which can be used by plants. The fact proves that the drought-resistant sand-fixing plants planted in Shapotou did not die in large numbers even in the driest year of 1957 (rainfall was 83.3 mm).

The tightness of the sand also has a great impact on plant growth. Although the roots of sand-fixing plants and arbor-shrub tree species growing on sand dunes have different depths, they are generally concentrated in the surface layer of the sand dunes, which is closely related to the bulk density of the sand. The plants planted on the shifting sand in Shapotou over the years have shown that some grow vigorously and some do not grow well, which are related to the tightness of the sand. The plant growth situation on sand dunes often varies depending on the location of the sand dunes. Plants growing in the low-lying areas of the lee slopes grow vigorously, plants grow very little in the middle of the windward slopes, and plants grow vigorously in the upper part of the windward slopes near the top of the dune. There are many factors that affect plant growth, but according to the investigation and measurement results of water content, nutrients, temperature, and tightness, it is pointed out that the biggest difference in the above three parts is the tightness.

Due to the mobility of the sand, plants have no foothold, seeds have no chance to germinate, and seedlings cannot take root. To overcome this difficulty, we must first take mechanical sand fixation measures. Facts have shown that many plants can grow where mechanical sand barriers have been built, and seeds can also successfully grow into seedlings, so stopping the movement of shifting sand is a major measure to ensure the success of plant sand fixation.

After testing, the following plants are suitable for growing in shifting sand: *Hedysarum scoparium*, *Salix psammophila*, *Salix flavida*, *Artemisia sphaerocephala*, *Artemisia wudanica*, and *Artemisia ordosica*. Among them, *Hedysarum scoparium* and *Artemisia wudanica* are good native tree species on shifting sand. They can grow sparsely under natural conditions. If artificially cultivated, they can form large shrubs. Whether planted or sown, the above-mentioned various sand-fixing plants must be protected by mechanical sand barriers in order to survive and grow stably. With the protection of mechanical sand barriers, their survival rate is very high, some reaching more than 80%. Therefore, deserts can grow plants, and shifting sand can be fixed by plants, which has been fully confirmed through years of research and practice.

Mechanical sand fixation is a temporary sand fixation method, an indispensable link for fixing shifting sand, and a necessary auxiliary measure for plant sand fixation. Mechanical sand fixation includes artificial sand barriers, asphalt sand fixation, clay sand fixation, and polymer sand fixation. Artificial sand barriers are the most commonly used type of mechanical sand fixation. Sand barriers combined with biological sand fixation have great benefits. Since the Zhongwei Desert Control Forest Farm began large-scale sand fixation and afforestation work in 1958, there has never been a large amount of sand accumulation on the roadbed, nor has there been any accident due to sand damage. It can be seen that shifting sand seems powerful, but it is not terrible. As long as we maintain a pragmatic scientific attitude and a tenacious revolutionary spirit, we can tame it.

Future sand control research work should, on the one hand, consolidate past achievements, that is, the experience gained in mechanical sand fixation and plant sand fixation; on the other hand, it should deepen step by step, so that sand control work can be developed and raised to a new stage.

In terms of mechanical sand fixation, grid-like grass sand barriers are a heavy and complicated task, requiring a large amount of manpower and materials, thus limiting promotion. We should study simple and easy new sand fixation methods, such as asphalt sand fixation and chemical sand fixation, to open up ways to eliminate deserts on a large scale. We have initially found some laws on the movement of wind and sand, such as the relationship between sand-raising wind and sand particle size, the higher the sand dune, the slower the movement, and the lower the sand dune, the faster the movement, and the greater the harm to the railway. We should conduct in-depth research in this area to achieve the effect of building railways in the desert without sand accumulation on the roadbed, and create favorable conditions for the development of desert railways.

Desert areas have low rainfall and dry climate, which limits plant growth; but according to survey data, the amount of groundwater in the desert is very abundant. The Tengger Desert has more than a hundred dry lakes of different sizes, and the groundwater is generally buried not deeply. The Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin both have a large amount of groundwater, buried in the desert. If it can be developed and utilized, it can not only supply plant growth and fix shifting sand, but also develop farming and animal husbandry, and comprehensively utilize the desert, which is of great economic significance.

Strong wind is a feature of the desert. Wind is originally a harmful meteorological factor in the desert. If we can tame it and use it as the kinetic energy for power generation, or as the power for driving machines, we can turn harmful factors into beneficial factors. Solar energy is more abundant in desert areas than in general areas. Some people estimate that if solar energy is utilized, it will be five times greater than the energy of coal in the world. How to control it and make it serve the people is a problem that needs to be solved in research work.

In terms of plant sand fixation, there are not many sand-fixing plants that can be used now, and they cannot meet the sand-fixing requirements of most areas. Therefore, taming or introducing excellent sand-fixing plant species, or directionally breeding new species, is an urgent task. Sand-fixing plants all have drought resistance properties. It is generally believed that plants with strong drought resistance consume less water and do not need much water during the growing season. According to research, in fact, plants growing in arid areas do not consume less water than plants in general areas. Therefore, what properties should be used to measure the drought resistance of plants, and how can its drought resistance be improved? These physiological phenomena need to be further studied in the future.

Desert distribution areas are wider, with different natural environmental conditions and different socio-economic situations. In the scientific research work of desert control, we must comprehensively develop and utilize the desert, understand and master the laws of nature, and better serve socialist construction.

Desert control is still a new science in our country, and there are many things to study. We should weigh the priorities according to manpower and material resources, which should not only conform to the long-term interests of the national economy, but also take care of the current interests of the people; we must not only complete the task, but also develop science and enrich the content of desert control science. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, we will certainly be able to create and develop a desert control science with Chinese characteristics.

    我国治沙科学上的一个成就
    中国科学院林业土壤研究所所长　朱济凡　副研究员　李鸣岗
    连接华北和西北的包兰铁路（包头至兰州）由兰州到银川一段，因黄河南岸水泉至大营一带地震严重，所以取道北线。但要六次跨过腾格里沙漠，延长路线达四十公里，其中以宁夏回族自治区中卫县西部沙坡头一段沙丘起伏最大，长达十六公里。人们称沙坡头为“裸沙丘”。有人称它为“世界沙漠的首都”。过去许多人都认为这是一块天生的不毛之地，非人力所能改造。在这貌似海洋的沙丘上修筑铁路，是难以设想的事。在我国人民掌握了政权的今天，人们不但敢想，而且敢作，包兰铁路终于在这巨大的沙漠上通过了。
    在沙漠上修筑铁路在我国还是一个创举。从工程技术来说，当时还没有成熟的经验。1954年铁道科学研究所（现为铁道科学研究院）在沙坡头附近做的路基试验研究结果证明：修筑沙漠路基在工程上不但是可能的，而且还有它独特的优点，如沙质疏松，施工容易，筑路经济，且沙土没有径流不受雨水冲刷，管理方便等等。但如何能使路轨不受沙粒淹没的危险，保证火车安全的行驶，则必须用植物将路基两侧的流沙固定下来。为了承担这一光荣而艰巨的任务，中国科学院林业土壤研究所1956年与铁道部第一设计局（现为第一设计院）、铁道科学研究院在沙坡头成立铁路防沙研究工作站，开展铁路固沙造林研究工作，进行生物固沙与机械固沙试验。为满足社会主义建设需要，限定三年完成研究任务，并提出铁路固沙造林技术设计方案。1957年成立了中卫固沙林场，大规模地开展了固沙造林工作。
    几年来由于党和政府的正确领导，群众的积极性与创造性的劳动和工作同志们的共同努力，这项任务已顺利地完成了。火车已能安全地行驶在这大沙漠上。自1958年8月1日通车以来，从未因沙害而发生过停车事故。历来为害人民的“黄龙”（当地居民称流沙为“黄龙”），今日已经驯服，强迫它穿上了绿衣，改变了面貌。1959年铁道部在中卫县召开沙漠铁路现场会议，大家一致地肯定了沙漠中修筑铁路的可能性，承认固沙造林的成功，为铁路建筑史上写下了新的一页。
    沙坡头处腾格里沙漠之东，南端面临黄河，一望无际的黄沙，犹如大海中的波浪。平时浮沙没腰，人畜惮行，遇大风时沙粒飞扬，遮蔽天日。沙粒经常移动，地形随时变更，以致沙丘上面几乎没有植物生长。这里属半荒漠地带，环境条件比较恶劣，气候干燥，年平均降水量约一百七十毫米，风大而频繁，气温夏酷热而冬酷冷，尤其是沙面温度最高可达摄氏七十度以上。所有这些气象因素都不是一般植物所能忍受的。沙丘高大，层层相叠，岗峦重重，流沙覆盖在三叠纪的紫红色沙岩夹页岩交互层上，厚达十米至百余米。在这历来就很少生长植物的流沙上，要用植物来固沙，开始时有些人不敢相信，以为是违反自然规律的事情。我们依靠了党的领导，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，以实事求是的态度仔细研究了流沙上控制植物生长的主导因子。经过反复的试验和多次的失败，终于摸索出了一条道路，在一定程度上掌握了自然规律。
    固定流沙有两种方法：一种是植物固沙，一种是机械固沙。在固沙措施中应以植物固沙为主，机械固沙为辅。
    植物固沙是一种最基本最可靠的永久固沙方法。流沙一经生长植物，它的基本性质就要改变，形成固定沙丘。在植物固沙过程中，选择适宜的固沙植物科是关系工作成败的一个关键。荒漠和半荒漠地带环境条件特殊，对植物生长不利。在选择固沙植物时，一方面要研究植物的生物学和生态学特性，凡能耐干旱，耐贫瘠，抗风性能强，生长快，根系发达的多年生植物为最好的固沙植物；另一方面要研究自然固沙过程中植物的演替规律，认清什么是流沙上的先锋植物，即能首先在流沙上生长的植物，什么是继先锋树种而生长的植物种类。植物的种类繁多，沙丘地面情况千变万化，如果不掌握它的规律，抓住主要因子，则难以使植物固沙成功。在沙坡头的流沙上，影响植物成活及生长的因子很多，而主要的有下列几个：1、沙内的水分情况，2、沙的松紧度，3、沙的流动性。
    沙漠中能不能生长植物，主要决定于它的水分状况。沙漠中的水分像黄金一样的宝贵。无论是沙漠或是戈壁，那里有水，那里就可以变成绿洲。沙坡头的沙丘高大，沙层深厚，地下水埋藏在深达数十米以下，不能被植物根系利用。在这样干燥条件下，生长植物的水分是否够用成为最重要的问题，所以对水分测定的研究成为重点项目之一。
    研究水分的结果表明：一、沙漠水分状态虽差，但也有它的优越性，在干沙之下层有一层稳定的湿沙，干沙还能起到保水作用，阻止湿沙层的水分蒸发。二、沙内的含水量虽少，但有效的水分较多，因为它的雕萎含水量较小。根据测定数字，沙坡头流沙的含水量经常为2％—3％，雕萎含水量为0.7％，可见有效含水量经常有1.3％—2.3％（即含水率减雕萎含水率），可供植物应用，事实证明，在沙坡头所栽植的抗旱性强的固沙植物在最干旱的1957年（降水量为83.3毫米）也没有大量死亡的现象。
    沙的松紧度对植物生长的影响也很大。沙丘上生长的固沙植物和乔灌木树种的根系虽有深浅不同，但一般都集中在沙丘的表层，这与沙子的松密度有密切关系。沙坡头历年在流沙上栽种的植物，有的生长旺盛，有的生长不好，这些都与沙的松紧度有关。在沙丘上植物生长情况常依沙丘部位不同而各异，在落沙坡低处生长的植物旺盛，在向风坡中部植物生长极少，在向风坡上部近丘顶处植物生长茁壮。影响植物生长的因素较多，但根据水分、养分、温度、松紧度的调查和测定的结果指出：在上述三种部位上差异最大的是松紧度。
    由于沙的流动性，植物无立足之地，种子没有机会发芽，幼苗无法扎根。要克服这个困难，首先就要采取机械固沙的办法。事实表明，凡是作好了机械沙障的地方，许多植物都能生长起来，种子也能顺利地成苗，所以停止流沙移动是保证植物固沙成功的一个主要措施。
    经过试验，目前有下列几种植物适于流沙生长：花捧，黄柳，拧条，头状沙杨枣，籽蒿及油蒿。其中花捧和籽蒿是流沙上的良好的乡土树种。它们能在自然状况下稀疏地生长。如经人工栽培，可以形成大片灌丛。上述各种固沙植物，无论栽植或是播种，都要有机械沙障的保护，才能稳定地成活与生长。有了机械沙障的保护，它们的成活率很高，有的达80％以上。因此，沙漠可以生长植物，流沙可以被植物固定，经过几年来的研究和实践，已经完全证实了。
    机械固沙是暂时的固沙法，为固定流沙不可缺少的一环，更是植物固沙的一种必要的辅助措施。机械固沙有人工沙障、沥青固沙、粘土固沙、高分子聚合物固沙等。人工沙障为机械固沙中最普遍采用的一种。沙障结合生物固沙，效益很大。自1958年中卫固沙林场大规模地展开固沙造林工作后，路基上从未有过大量积沙现象，也没有因沙害而发生事故。可见流沙貌似强大，并不可怕，只要我们持实事求是的科学态度，顽强的革命精神，就能把它驯服。
    今后的固沙研究工作，一方面要巩固以往的成就，即机械固沙和植物固沙所取得的经验；另一方面又要步步深入，使固沙工作得到发展并提高到新的阶段。
    在机械固沙方面，格状草沙障是一种繁重而复杂的工作，需要大批的人力，大量的材料，因而限制了推广。应研究简而易行的新的固沙法，如沥青固沙、化学固沙等，为大规模地消灭沙漠开辟途径。对于风沙的移动，我们已初步摸到了一些规律，如起沙风与沙粒大小的关系，沙丘愈高，移动愈慢，低沙丘则移动快，对铁路的危害性更大。我们应该深入开展这方面的研究，达到在沙漠中修筑铁路不使路基积沙的效果，为发展沙漠铁路创造有利条件。
    沙漠地区降水量少，气候干燥，限制了植物生长；但据调查资料，沙漠中的地下水量是很丰富的。腾格里沙漠有百余个大小不同的干涸湖泊，一般地下水埋藏不深。塔里木盆地和柴达木盆地都有大量的地下水，埋藏在沙漠里面。如能开发利用，则不但可以供给植物生长、固定流沙，而且还可以发展农垦和畜牧业，综合利用沙漠，在经济上具有重大意义。
    风大是沙漠中的特征。风在沙漠中本来是一个有害的气象因子，如果我们能把它驯服起来，利用它作为发电的动能，或为开动机器的动力，则可变有害因素为有利因素。太阳能在沙漠地区比一般地区充沛，有人估计如果把太阳能利用起来，要比世界上煤的能量大五倍。如何控制它，使它为人民服务，是研究工作中尚待解决的问题。
    在植物固沙方面，现在可以采用的固沙植物还不多，不能满足较多数地区的固沙要求，因此驯化或引进优良的固沙植物种，或定向地培育新种是一件刻不容缓的工作。固沙植物都具有抗旱性能，一般认为抗旱性能强的植物，用水量少，在生长期间不需要多的水分。根据研究证明，事实上生长在干旱地区的植物，它消耗水分的数量并不比一般地区的植物少。因此植物的抗旱性能要用什么性质来衡量，怎样能提高它的抗旱强度，这些生理现象，都有待于今后深入研究。
    沙漠分布的地区较广，自然环境条件各异，社会经济情况亦不相同。在治沙科学研究工作中，我们必须综合开发利用沙漠，认识和掌握自然规律，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    治沙在我国还是一门新的科学，要研究的东西很多。应根据人力物力，衡量轻重缓急，既要符合国家经济的长远利益，又要照顾人民的当前利益；既要完成任务，又要发展科学，丰富治沙学内容。我们相信，在党的领导下，一定能够创造与发展具有中国特色的治沙科学。
