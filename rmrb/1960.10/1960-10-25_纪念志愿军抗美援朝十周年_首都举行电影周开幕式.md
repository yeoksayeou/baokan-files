Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The "Film Week Commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea," jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, held its opening ceremony this afternoon at the Capital Theater in Beijing. The film week will be held from the 25th to the 31st in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Xi'an. The films to be screened include the Korean art films "Comrades-in-Arms," "Reconnaissance Soldiers," "How Can We Live Separated," and the Chinese documentaries "Historical Witness" and art films "North of the 38th Parallel," "Friendship," and "Shangganling," a total of seven films. These films vividly reflect the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people and armies in defeating the American aggressors, as well as the unbreakable combat friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people.

    Attending the opening ceremony were Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association; Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Major General Xie Fang, former Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers; combat hero Hu Xiudao; and more than 1,200 people from all walks of life in the capital.

    Li Yonghao, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Counselor Ma Dongshan, and embassy staff, Kim Yong-hwan, head of the Korean Broadcasting and Television Delegation, and members, and Li Jae-rim, head of the Korean Museum Visiting Group, and members, all attended the opening ceremony. Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

    Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said: This film week will help the Chinese people review the great achievements of the Chinese and Korean people fighting side by side, bravely resisting the American aggressors, and defending peace in the Far East and the world, and to be educated by this glorious history. He said that the victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the signing of the armistice agreement show that American imperialism is a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. It must not only be defeated, but can be defeated. Only by carrying out a tit-for-tat struggle against it can its policies of aggression and war be thwarted, and world peace be effectively defended.

    In his speech, Wei Chuantong condemned American imperialism for consistently undermining the armistice agreement, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and threatening peace in Asia and the world since the Korean armistice seven years ago. He said: The Chinese and Korean people love peace, but as long as American imperialism has not rolled out of Taiwan and South Korea, the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, their sacred territory, and the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, must be carried out resolutely to the end. He emphasized that the combat friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people is eternal and unbreakable.

    Ambassador Li Yonghao spoke at the opening ceremony, extending warm, cordial, and brotherly greetings to the Chinese people and to the heroic former officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war was a great encouragement to the Korean people in their struggle for victory, and a heavy blow to the American imperialist aggressors. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, closely coordinated their operations, drove the American aggressors out of the entire northern half of the Republic, and forced them to sign the armistice agreement. The internationalist fighters trained and cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Volunteers, were not afraid of sacrifice and bloodshed in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. They cherished every blade of grass and tree in Korea, and helped our people with the love of flesh and blood. The great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people will forever remain in the hearts of the Korean people, together with the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea.

    Ambassador Li Yonghao said that today, our two peoples are further strengthening our mutual cooperation, and an unprecedented high tide has formed in socialist construction. The achievements gained by the peoples of Korea and China have made tremendous contributions not only to strengthening the power of the peoples of Korea and China, but also to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Ambassador Li Yonghao said that the Chinese People's Volunteers had already voluntarily withdrawn from Korea, creating favorable conditions for a peaceful solution to the Korean question. However, the American imperialist aggressors continue to occupy the southern half of our country's territory and have turned it into a base for atomic weapons and rockets. American imperialism is also plotting to expand its aggression in the Taiwan Strait region, China's sacred territory, seriously threatening peace in the Far East. He said that any conspiracy and machination by American imperialism will surely be completely defeated, just as it was badly battered in the Korean War.

    At the opening ceremony, the documentary "Historical Witness" and the art film "Shangganling," which depict the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army defeating the American aggressors together, were screened.

    纪念志愿军抗美援朝十周年
    首都举行电影周开幕式
    新华社24日讯　中华人民共和国文化部和中国朝鲜友好协会联合举办的“纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年电影周”，于今天下午在北京首都剧场举行开幕式。电影周将于25日至31日在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州、武汉、成都、西安等城市举行。放映的影片有朝鲜艺术片“战友”、“侦察兵”、“分开怎能活下去”，中国纪录片“历史的见证”和艺术片“三八线上”、“友谊”、“上甘岭”等七部影片。这些影片都生动地反映了中朝两国人民和军队打败美国侵略者的伟大胜利，以及中朝人民用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的战斗友谊。
    出席开幕式的有文化部副部长夏衍，中朝友好协会副会长魏传统，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，对外文委副主任罗俊，前中国人民志愿军参谋长解方少将和战斗英雄胡修道，以及首都各界人士一千二百多人。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐、参赞马东山和大使馆人员，朝鲜广播电视代表团团长金容焕和团员，朝鲜博物馆参观团团长李载林和团员，都出席了开幕式。各国驻华使节和武官也应邀出席了开幕式。
    中朝友好协会副会长魏传统在开幕式上讲话。他说：这个电影周将帮助中国人民回顾中朝人民并肩作战，英勇抗击美国侵略者，保卫远东和世界和平的伟大业迹，并从这段光辉的历史中得到教育。他说，中朝人民的胜利和停战协定的签订说明：美帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎，不但必须打败它，而且也是可以打败的。只有同它进行针锋相对的斗争，才能挫败它的侵略政策和战争政策，才能有效地保卫世界和平。
    魏传统在讲话中，谴责了美帝国主义自从朝鲜停战七年来一贯破坏停战协定，阻挠朝鲜和平统一，威胁亚洲和世界和平。他说：中朝人民爱好和平，但是只要美帝国主义还没有从台湾滚出去、从南朝鲜滚出去，中国人民解放祖国领土台湾的斗争、朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争，就一定要坚决进行到底。他强调说：中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是永恒的牢不可破的。
    李永镐大使在开幕式上讲话，他向中国人民，向英雄的前志愿军官兵，表示热烈的、亲切的、兄弟般的问候。他说，中国人民志愿军出国作战，对于朝鲜人民争取战争胜利是极大的鼓舞，对于美帝国主义侵略者则是沉重的打击。中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军并肩携手，紧密地协同作战，把美国侵略者赶出共和国整个北半部地区，并迫使它在停战协定上签字。中国共产党和毛泽东同志教育和培养出来的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军勇士们，为了维护亚洲与世界和平，不怕牺牲流血。他们珍惜朝鲜的一草一木，怀着亲骨肉般的热爱，帮助了我国人民。中国人民志愿军建立的丰功伟迹，和中国人民对朝鲜人民的深情厚谊，将同朝鲜的美丽山河一起，永远留在朝鲜人民的心中。
    李永镐大使说，今天我们两国人民，进一步加强着我们两国之间的互相合作，在社会主义建设中，形成了空前的高潮。朝中两国人民所获得的成就，不仅对于加强朝中两国人民的威力，而且对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，作出了巨大贡献。
    李永镐大使说，中国人民志愿军早已主动地撤出朝鲜，为和平解决朝鲜问题创造了有利的条件。然而美帝国主义侵略者却继续霸占着我国土地的南半部，把它变成原子和火箭基地。美帝国主义还阴谋在中国的神圣领土台湾海峡地区扩大它的侵略，严重地威胁着远东的和平。他说，美帝国主义的任何阴谋策动，也一定会像在朝鲜战争中碰得头破血流一样，彻底地遭到失败。
    在开幕式上，放映了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起打败美国侵略者的纪录片“历史的见证”和艺术片“上甘岭”。
