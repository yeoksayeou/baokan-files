Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: In a speech delivered at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo yesterday afternoon before being assassinated by a fascist thug, Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejirō Asanuma strongly condemned the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demanded that Japan become a completely independent country.

Asanuma said, "The U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' issue is the most important issue for Japan. Because the government forcibly revised the security treaty, Japan, which has suffered the bitterness of stationed foreign troops for fifteen years, will have to allow the U.S. military to use its territory for another ten years. This is an unprecedented situation in Japanese history."

He said, "Japan's constitution clearly stipulates that Japan should renounce war and should not maintain any strategic military forces. According to this provision of the constitution, Japan is not allowed to conclude any military alliance treaty with foreign countries. The government's act of concluding a new military treaty is clearly a serious violation of our country's constitution."

He pointed out, "The U.S. military enjoys extraterritorial rights on the military bases provided by Japan to the United States. This means that Japan is not yet fully independent. Moreover, when the United States orders Japan to expand the area of military bases, as we have personally witnessed in many places in our country, bloodshed is bound to occur."

He said, "In order to become a completely independent country, Japan should demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops and demand the return of all areas occupied by the United States to Japan. In order to get rid of the American occupation, Japan should become a neutral country."

Asanuma pointed out that concluding a military alliance with the United States will increase the risk of war. According to the obligations stipulated in the treaty, Japan must bear the obligation to increase military expenditures. He also expressed concern that the Japanese government, according to the obligations stipulated in the treaty, would take measures to restrict freedom of speech and then amend the constitution.

Asanuma emphasized that Japan should first sever military ties with the United States. He said, "The main purpose of Japanese diplomacy must be to help establish a new collective security system including Japan, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. This collective security system will be based on principles such as independent foreign policy, respect for territorial integrity, and mutual non-aggression."

Asanuma said, "We believe that in the upcoming general election, our most important responsibility is to remind the Japanese people of the danger of war caused by the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'."

Speaking of Japan's relations with China, Asanuma said, "Japan has signed a treaty with the Kuomintang government of Taiwan. It is very unnatural that Japan has no diplomatic relations with China, which has a population of 600 million. There is only one China, and Taiwan is part of China. Japan must normalize Japan-China diplomatic relations as soon as possible."

He said, "However, the Ikeda Cabinet, which is subservient to the United States, voted against China's entry into the United Nations at this autumn's United Nations General Assembly. In the United Nations, neutral countries have turned to support China's entry into the United Nations, and it is unwise to ignore the trends of these countries." He said that if Japan does so, Japan will become an orphan in Asia.

He said, "Even within the Liberal Democratic Party, there are leaders like Ishibashi and Matsumura who understand the China issue. Our party is willing to cooperate with conservatives who are enthusiastic about normalizing Japan-China relations."

    浅沼稻次郎在被害前发表演说
    反对日美条约　主张日本中立
    他还说：中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分。日本必须尽早使日中邦交正常化
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎昨天下午被法西斯暴徒暗杀以前在东京日比谷公会堂发表的演说中，强烈谴责侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，要求日本成为完全独立的国家。
    浅沼说，“美日‘安全条约’问题是日本最重要的问题。由于政府强行修改安全条约，十五年来备尝驻扎外国军队之苦的日本将不得不容许美军再使用它的领土十年。这是日本历史上未曾有过的不平常情况。”
    他说，“日本的宪法明确规定，日本应当放弃战争并且不应当保持任何战略军事力量。根据宪法的这项规定是不准日本同外国缔结任何军事同盟条约的。政府缔结新军事条约的行为显然严重违反我国的宪法。”
    他指出，“在日本向美国提供的军事基地上，美军享有治外法权。这就是说，日本还未完全独立。而且，当美国命令日本扩大军事基地的面积的时候，像我们在我国许多地方亲眼看到的那样，就必然造成流血事件。”
    他说，“为了成为完全独立的国家，日本应当要求美军撤退，要求把美国占领的全部地区归还日本。为了摆脱美国的占领，日本应当成为中立国家。”
    浅沼指出，同美国缔结军事同盟将增加战争的危险，根据条约规定的义务，日本必须承担增加军事开支的义务。他还表示担心日本政府根据条约所规定的义务，会采取措施来限制言论自由，进而修改宪法。
    浅沼强调说，日本应当首先割断同美国的军事联系。他说，“日本外交的主要目的必须是这样，以便有助于建立包括日本、美国、中国和苏联在内的新集体安全体系。这种集体安全体系将以独立的外交政策、尊重领土完整和互不侵犯等原则为基础。”
    浅沼说，“我们认为，在未来的大选中，我们最重要的责任是提醒日本人民注意日美‘安全条约’所引起的战争危险。”
    谈到日本同中国的关系问题时，浅沼说，“日本同台湾的国民党政府签订了条约。日本同有六亿人口的中国没有外交关系，这是很不自然的。中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分。日本必须尽早使日中邦交正常化。”
    他说，“但是，屈从美国的池田内阁在今年秋季的联合国大会上投票反对中国进入联合国。在联合国中，中立国家都转而支持中国进入联合国，忽视这些国家的动向是不明智的。”他说，如果日本这样做，日本将成为亚洲的孤儿。
    他说，“甚至在自由民主党内部，有像石桥和松村这些了解中国问题的领袖。我党愿意同热心使日中关系正常化的保守党人合作。”
