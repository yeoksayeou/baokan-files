Iraqi Minister of National Guidance Says
Chinese People's Achievements Worth Admiring
Rapid Development in a Few Years Astonishing

    Iraqi Minister of National Guidance Faisal al-Samir, who recently visited China, said on the 16th: "The achievements of the Chinese people in all fields are admirable."
    Dr. Samir told the Iraqi News Agency: "The emergence of so many tall buildings, large factories, people's communes, modern highways, universities, and cultural facilities in China is astonishing for people to see such rapid development in such a short period of time."
    Samir believes his trip to China was "an excellent experience." He said: "The remnants of backwardness and poverty left over from many centuries in China have been swept away. We have found that since liberation, China has made tremendous progress in terms of modern development." He added: "What I saw was constant hard work, construction day and night, and the Chinese people, men and women, tirelessly engaged in work, wholeheartedly striving for development."
    He said: "The Chinese were very enthusiastic about showing me all aspects of their country's development. This made me feel how proud they are of their work in these years."

    萨米尔博士对伊拉克通讯社说：“在中国出现了那么多的高楼大厦、大工厂、人民公社、现代化的公路、大学和文化设施，人们对于在这样短短几年之内的迅速发展感到惊异。”
    萨米尔认为，他的中国之行是“一次出色的经历”。他说：“中国许多世纪以来遗留下来的落后和贫困状态的残余，已经一扫而光。我们发现，自从解放以来，中国在现代化的发展方面取得了巨大的进展”。他又说：“我看到的是不断的辛勤劳动，夜以继日地在进行建设，中国人民男男女女在不倦地从事工作，专心致志力求发展”。
    他说：“中国人非常热心地把他们国家的发展的各个方面介绍给我看。这使我感觉到他们对于自己在这些年来的工作是多么自豪”。
