Xinhua News Agency, September 30th News: Approaching the holiday, good news about production continues to pour in from the capital's industrial front. By the 25th, 140 factories in the city had completed their September production plans ahead of schedule, and the workers are joyfully welcoming National Day.

　　In September, all factories and mines in the city launched a vigorous production competition with increased production and economy as the center. Xuanwu Steel Plant, in the hundred red flag competition, planted red flags and set up pacesetters, comprehensively promoted the operation method of the No. 7 blast furnace to increase wind temperature and smelting strength, as well as the shift handover system of people replacing people, and accelerated the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, so that the production level of each blast furnace continued to rise. The entire plant has completed September's pig iron production plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. Beijing Coking Chemical Plant launched a surge of "everyone doing good deeds for steel production." The entire plant, from top to bottom, and left to right, twisted into one rope, completing the September metallurgical coke production plan ahead of schedule.

　　In the high tide of "Welcoming National Day and Seizing High Output," cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production to strengthen grass-roots work. The cadres of Xuanwu Machinery Factory, which mainly produces gas engines and diesel engines for agricultural use, took the lead in going deep into the production groups, together with the workers, to engage in technical innovation, improve operating methods and tools, and strictly check the system. Not only did they complete September's production plan ahead of schedule, but they also ensured that every machine was qualified.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 30th: The increased production and economy movement centered on grain and steel on Shanghai's industrial front, after more than a month of vigorous and in-depth development, has achieved brilliant results. As of the 29th, according to incomplete statistics from twelve districts in the city, more than 1,000 factories have completed their September or third-quarter production plans ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment.

　　As soon as September arrived, the workers in all walks of life in Shanghai immediately set off a high tide of increased production and economy. The steel workers took the lead, putting forward the slogan of "Converters should be universally improved, open-hearth furnaces should rise steadily, and electric furnaces should make great leaps forward," which greatly increased the city's steel production. Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory, which has completed its plans every month since the beginning of this year, increased the daily output level of electric furnace steel in September by 21% compared with August, completing the September plan two days ahead of schedule. Changfeng Steel Casting Factory had a heavy task in September. The workers went to fraternal factories outside the factory to learn advanced experience, and at the same time carried out a three-shift competition in the factory, which increased the daily output of steel by 50%, completing the monthly plan four days ahead of schedule.

　　In the increased production and economy movement, leading cadres at all levels went to the forefront of production to labor and discuss with the workers. The workers of China Machine Factory, which produces agricultural machinery, put forward the goal of striving to complete the September plan ten days ahead of schedule. At the beginning of September, the factory leaders mobilized the masses to arrange the daily work according to the requirements of completing the plan ten days ahead of schedule; on the other hand, they went deep into the workshops and found that there were two problems in completing the plan ten days ahead of schedule: one was the lack of 25% of work hours, and the other was that the collaborating factory had difficulties in completing the outsourced parts such as the crusher shell ahead of schedule. Leading cadres and the masses together improved the process and tools, and realized more than 20 technical innovations in just four days, so that the work hours were not only not lacking but also surplus. The collaborating factory did not have time to deliver the goods, so the factory sent nine young workers to support them. As a result, with mutual help from both sides, not only did China Machine Factory complete the September plan eleven days ahead of schedule, but Weihai Iron Factory, which manufactured supporting parts for them, also completed the September plan five days ahead of schedule.

　　The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has had new development in this new upsurge of increased production and economy. Many factories that undertake equipment supporting grain and steel, while consolidating old innovation projects, have also realized many new processes and technologies, and successfully researched and developed many new products that save labor, save materials, and are highly efficient.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 30th: The workers on the industrial front in Tianjin are in high spirits in the increased production and economy movement centered on grain and steel, and enthusiastically launched a competition to welcome National Day, promoting continuous rise in production. As of the 29th, 268 factories in the city had completed all September plans for output, quality, variety, consumption, labor productivity, and safety ahead of schedule, dedicating them to National Day.

　　In September, all factories successively mobilized the broad masses of workers to discuss and revise the plans by telling the workers about the situation, assigning tasks, planting red flags, and setting up pacesetters, formulated specific measures to realize the plans, and formulated guarantee conditions for dedicating gifts to National Day from individuals, groups to workshops and factories, and launched various forms of competition movements such as opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, and tackling key problem competitions. In the competition, many factories focused on the weak links and key problems in production, and grasped the great summary, great promotion, great improvement, and great development of technical innovation and technical revolution. Tianjin Electromagnetic Wire Factory systematically promoted, improved, and developed the realized innovation projects with a plan and leadership. In September, more than 80 innovation projects have been applied in production, so the monthly production plan was fully completed nine days ahead of schedule, realizing an all-round leap forward in output, quality, variety, low consumption, and no accidents.

    用九月的出色成绩向国庆献礼
    北京上海天津大批工业企业提前超额完成上月生产计划
    据新华社30日讯　临近节日，首都工业战线上生产捷报不断传来。到25日，全市已有一百四十个工厂提前完成了9月份生产计划，职工们喜气洋洋地迎国庆。
    全市各厂矿在9月份以增产节约为中心，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛高潮。宣武钢铁厂在百面红旗竞赛中，插红旗，树标兵，全面推广七号高炉提高风温和冶炼强度的操作方法，以及人顶人的交接班制度，并且加速小高炉的技术改造，使各座高炉的生产水平不断上升，全厂已提前超额完成9月份生铁生产计划。北京炼焦化学厂掀起了“人人为钢铁生产做好事”的热潮，全厂上下左右拧成一股劲，提前完成了9月份的冶金焦的生产计划。
    在“迎国庆夺高产”的高潮中，各级干部纷纷深入生产第一线，加强基层工作。以生产农业用的煤气机、柴油机为主的宣武机械厂的干部，由党委书记带头深入生产小组，与工人一起大闹技术革新，改进操作方法和工具，严格检查制度，不仅提前完成了9月份生产计划，还做到台台机器合格。
    据新华社上海30日电　上海工业战线上以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，经过一个多月的蓬勃深入发展，已经取得了辉煌成果。到29日为止，据全市十二个区不完全的统计，已有一千多个工厂提前和超额完成了9月份或第三季度的生产计划。
    上海各行各业的职工一进入9月，立即掀起增产节约运动的热潮。钢铁工人一马当先，他们提出“转炉要普遍提高，平炉要稳步上升，电炉要突飞猛进”的口号，使全市钢产量出现了大幅度上升的局面。今年以来月月完成计划的上海机修总厂，9月份电炉钢的日产水平，比8月份增长了21％，提前两天完成了9月份的计划。长风铸钢厂9月份任务很重，职工们一方面到厂外学习兄弟厂的先进经验，一方面在厂内开展三班竞赛，使钢的日产量猛增50％，提前四天完成了当月计划。
    在增产节约运动中，各级领导干部都亲临生产第一线，和工人一起劳动，一起商量。生产农业机械的中国机器厂的工人们，提出争取提前十天完成9月份计划的奋斗目标。9月初，工厂领导上一边发动群众根据提前十天的要求，安排每天的工作；一边深入车间，发现要提前十天有两个问题：一个是缺少25％工时，一个是粉碎机外壳等外包件，协作厂要提前完成有困难。领导干部和群众一起，改进工艺和工夹具，在短短四天内实现了二十多项技术革新，使工时不仅不缺，反而有余。协作厂来不及交货，厂里就派九个青年工人前去支援。结果，在双方相互帮助下，不仅中国机器厂提前十一天完成了9月份计划，为他们制造协作件的卫海铁工厂也提前五天完成了9月份计划。
    技术革新和技术革命运动，在这增产节约运动新高潮中，有了新的发展。许多承担支援粮钢的设备的工厂，在巩固老的革新项目的同时，又实现了许多新工艺、新技术，研究成功了不少省工省料又高效的新产品。
    据新华社天津30日电　天津市工业战线的职工，在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，意气风发，热热烈烈地掀起了迎国庆的竞赛活动，促进生产不断上升。到29日止，全市已有二百六十八家工厂提前全面完成9月份产量、质量、品种、消耗、劳动生产率、安全等各项计划，向国庆节献礼。
    9月份，各厂先后通过向职工讲形势、交任务、插红旗、树标兵，发动职工群众普遍讨论修订了计划，制订了实现计划的具体措施，从个人、小组到车间、工厂，层层订出了向国庆节献礼的保证条件，并展开了对手赛、对口赛、攻关赛等各种形式的竞赛运动。在竞赛中，许多工厂针对生产薄弱环节和关键问题，狠抓技术革新和技术革命的大总结、大推广、大提高、大发展工作。天津电磁线厂有计划有领导地推广、提高和发展已实现的革新项目。9月份，已将八十多项革新项目应用在生产中，因此全月生产计划提前九天全面完成，实现了产量、质量、品种、低消耗、无事故全面跃进。
