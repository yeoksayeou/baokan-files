Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - A conference was held by the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the afternoon of the 4th to celebrate the third anniversary of the launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union. Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said at the meeting that the great achievements the Soviet Union had made in conquering space in the past three years had prepared realistic conditions for the realization of human space flight.

In his opening remarks, Nesmeyanov said that thanks to the achievements made by the Soviet Union in rocket technology, it can now be said that a new science—practical astronomy—has begun to be established. Soviet scientists are pleased to see that the Soviet Union is at the forefront of the work of conquering space.

The celebration heard reports from the famous Soviet space flight scientist Academician Sedov and biologist Academician Sisakyan.

Sedov said that due to a series of achievements made in the past three years, the issue of realizing human space flight has been put on the agenda, and the day to realize this ideal of mankind is not far away. It is now certain that humans can complete interplanetary travel in spacecraft.

However, Sedov pointed out that before humans fly to Mars and Venus, scientists still have to solve a series of new problems, such as the problem of carrier rockets, further improvement of the precision of mechanical work, and long-distance radio communication.

Sisakyan pointed out in his report that the experiment of the second spacecraft is of great significance for the realization of human space flight. Currently, further studies are being conducted on the experimental animals on the second spacecraft. According to the results of the investigation so far, the bacteria loaded on the second spacecraft have not undergone any genetic variation after returning to Earth.

Sisakyan also said that future manned spacecraft should have sealed cabins that are insulated from the outside world. Artificial atmospheres and temperatures that are beneficial to the human body can be maintained in the cabin. He pointed out that various shock absorber schemes have been proposed to prevent the harmful effects of vibration on the body.

Xinhua News Agency report: TASS reports: Timakov, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, told a reporter from "Moscow Truth" that a committee composed of some of the most famous medical experts is conducting extremely strict examinations of cosmonaut candidates.

Timakov emphasized that he believes that the profession of jet pilots is the most suitable profession for space travelers. The ability to operate aircraft and determine orientation in space is invaluable to cosmonauts.

He pointed out that special attention is paid to the examination of the nervous system of candidates, and the requirements in this regard are particularly high. Cosmonauts should also have well-developed muscular systems, quick reactions, strong will, perseverance, and be good at determining the direction and making quick decisions under the most complex conditions.

Timakov said that the cosmonaut candidates are slightly shorter than average in height and slightly thinner in body shape, because the sealed cabin is very narrow, and every kilogram of weight must be considered in space.

The working day of future cosmonauts is arranged on a minute-by-minute basis. The work and rest schedule has a long arrangement period, about a month, and it is arranged day by day. Candidates are studying astronomy and botany, medicine and electronics, geography and radio engineering, and have set aside special time for training in temperature and pressure controlled chambers. Some instruments record the condition of the experimenters at minus 100 degrees and at an altitude of 50,000 meters. During all these experiments, cosmonaut candidates wear special space suits.

They engage in physical activities at the appointed time—weightlifting, volleyball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis. Other times are spent studying the extremely important equipment that the spacecraft will be equipped with.

    莫斯科集会纪念人造卫星上天三周年
    苏联科学家对宇宙飞行候选人进行严格考察
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联科学院在4日下午举行会议，庆祝苏联发射世界上第一个人造地球卫星上天三周年。苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫院士在会上说，三年来苏联在征服宇宙方面所取得的巨大成就，为实现人的宇宙飞行准备了现实条件。
    ?斯米扬诺夫在致开会辞中说，由于苏联在火箭技术方面取得的成就，现在可以说，一门新的科学——实用天文学已经开始建立。苏联科学家高兴地看到，在征服宇宙的工作中，苏联走在最前面。
    庆祝会听取了苏联著名宇宙飞行学家谢道夫院士和生物学家西萨基扬院士所作的报告。
    谢道夫说，由于三年来取得的一系列成就，实现人的宇宙飞行这一问题已经提上日程，实现人类这一理想的日子已经不远了。现在已经可以确信，人可以乘坐飞行器械完成行星际旅行。
    但是，谢道夫指出，在实现人飞向火星和金星之前，科学家还要解决一系列新的问题，例如运载火箭的问题、机械工作精密度进一步提高以及远程无线电联系等问题。
    西萨基扬在报告中指出，第二个宇宙飞船的实验对于实现人的宇宙飞行有着重要意义。目前正在对第二个宇宙飞船上的试验动物进行进一步的考察。根据到目前为止的考察结果，第二个宇宙飞船装载的细菌在返回地球后还没有发生任何遗传变异。
    西萨基扬还说，未来的载人宇宙飞船应当具有与外界绝缘的密封舱。舱内可以用人工维持对人的机体有利的大气和温度。他指出，在防止机体免受震荡的有害影响方面，已提出了建造各种减震器的方案。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联医学科学院副院长季马科夫对“莫斯科真理报”记者谈话说，一个由一些极著名的医学专家组成的委员会，正在对宇宙飞行候选人进行极严格的考察。
    季马科夫强调指出，他认为，喷气式飞机驾驶员的职业是宇宙旅行家最适合的职业。具有操纵飞机和在空间确定方位等能力，对宇宙飞行家说来都是极珍贵的。
    他指出，对候选人神经系统的检查，受到特别巨大的注意，这方面的要求特别高。宇宙飞行家还应当具有发育良好的肌肉系统，反应灵敏，意志顽强，坚毅沉着，善于在最复杂的条件下确定方针并迅速作出决定。
    季马科夫说，宇宙飞行候选人身材比中等略低一些，体型微瘦，这是因为密封舱很窄，在宇宙中必须考虑每一公斤重量。
    未来宇宙飞行家的工作日是以每分钟为单位来安排的。作息时间表安排期限很长，一月左右，而且是逐日安排的。候选人正在研究天文学和植物学、医学和电子学、地理学和无线电工学，并拨出了专门的时间从事在保温保压室中的训练。一些仪器记录着试验者在负一百度温度下和五万米高空中的状况。在进行所有这些实验期间，宇宙飞行候选人都穿着专门的宇宙服。
    他在规定的时间从事体育活动——举重、打排球、体操、游泳、打网球。其它时间研究宇宙飞船将装备的极重要的设备。
