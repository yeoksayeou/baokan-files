Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th - The US Air Force's attempt to launch the "Discoverer XVI" artificial Earth satellite at Vandenberg Air Force Base on the night of the 26th has once again ended in failure.

After the satellite was launched, due to a mechanical failure, the second-stage rocket failed to separate from the first stage, and the entire rocket, along with the satellite, crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
