Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th -- TASS reported from New York on the 13th: The head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev, hosted a banquet on the 12th for delegations from some African countries and Cyprus.

The following heads or acting heads of delegations attended the banquet: Nigeria, Cameroon, Dahomey, Upper Volta, Cyprus, Togo, Ivory Coast, Malagasy Republic, Somalia, as well as representatives from the following delegations: Chad, Mali, Senegal.

The Soviet side was represented by members and advisors of the Soviet delegation.

At the end of the banquet, the head of the Cameroonian delegation, Minister of Foreign Affairs Okala, delivered a speech. He thanked the Soviet Union and its friends for their efforts in defending the freedom of African countries. He also said that if anyone had ever given us independence, it was not out of sincerity. Some people want to replace the shackles of the past with new economic fetters. He also said that the Soviet Union's relations with African countries prove that the strong can sincerely help the weak.

Then Khrushchev gave a reply. He said that the Soviet government and people are fully aware of the responsibilities they bear. They understand that the Soviet Union is strong, and the strength, reason, and will of the Soviet Union should be used to safeguard and consolidate peace, and to oppose those who provoke war. The Soviet people yearn for peace and friendship, and yearn for all peoples to enjoy freedom and happiness.

He said that the colonialists are trying to portray us as "Soviet imperialists," as "communist colonialists." Do not believe them. The Soviet Union does not want anything from the people of Africa and other continents except friendship. We are prepared to help you forever, as long as you ask. He said that the Soviet Union has all the necessary conditions to develop smoothly. As for the question of communism, it is a matter for the people of each country, and this question is resolved by the free choice of the people of each country.

Khrushchev said that communism is not a distant goal. Communism is the complete, realistic, and concrete living conditions of the people: very short working days, comfortable housing, the lowest rents in the world, good clothes, children who are well-fed and well-educated for free, state grants for university students, free medical care, preferential treatment, and the abolition of taxes for residents—in another five years, the Soviet Union will completely abolish taxes, these are living communist factors.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union can trade with African countries and cooperate in a friendly manner. He said that when American monopoly capital declared an economic blockade against Cuba and would not sell it oil, the Soviet Union helped Cuba, supplied it with oil, and bought sugar from the Cubans.

Khrushchev invited representatives of African countries to visit the Soviet Union. He said, if you take a look at the lives of the people of all ethnic groups who lived under colonial oppression before the revolution, they are now living freely and happily, you will believe how absurd the imperialists' slander about "communist slaves" is.

Khrushchev finally wished the guests well in their lives and hoped that they would achieve success in the struggle for the independence and happiness of African countries.

    赫鲁晓夫宴请联大非洲国家代表
    喀麦隆代表团长揭露使非洲受到新经济束缚的阴谋
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫12日设宴招待一些非洲国家和塞浦路斯的代表团。
    出席宴会的有下列代表团团长或代理团长：尼日利亚、喀麦隆、达荷美、上沃尔特、塞浦路斯、多哥、象牙海岸、马尔加什共和国、索马里，以及下列代表团代表：乍得、马里、塞内加尔。
    苏联方面出席的有苏联代表团团员和顾问。
    宴会结束时，喀麦隆代表团团长、外交部部长奥卡拉发表了讲话。他感谢苏联和苏联的朋友为捍卫非洲国家的自由而作的努力。他还说，如果有人曾经给我们独立，这也不是出于真心。有人想用新的经济束缚来代替过去的奴隶枷锁。他还说，苏联同非洲国家的关系证明了，强者是可以真心援助弱者的。
    接着赫鲁晓夫致答辞。他说，苏联政府和人民完全意识到他们所担负的责任。他们了解，苏联是强大的，苏联的力量、理智和意志应当用来维护和巩固和平，反对那些挑起战争的人。苏联人民渴望和平和友谊，渴望各国人民都能享有自由和幸福。
    他说，殖民主义者企图把我们说成是“苏联帝国主义者”、说成“共产主义者——殖民主义者”。你们不要相信。苏联除了友谊之外，不想从非洲和其他洲的人民那里得到任何东西。我们准备永远帮助你们，只要你们要求就行。他说，苏联具备一切必要的条件来使自己顺利发展。至于共产主义的问题，这是每个国家人民的事情，这个问题由每个国家人民自由选择来解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共产主义并不是遥远的目标。共产主义就是人民的完全现实而具体的生活条件：很短的工作日，舒适的住宅，世界上最低的房租，良好的衣着，吃喝得很好的孩子，对他们进行免费教育，大学生有国家助学金，免费医疗，优抚金，取消居民的赋税——再过五年，苏联将完全取消赋税，这些就是活生生的共产主义因素。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联可以同非洲国家进行贸易，友好合作。他说，当美国垄断资本宣布对古巴进行经济封锁，不卖给它石油时，苏联帮助了古巴，供给它石油，并向古巴人购买糖。
    赫鲁晓夫邀请非洲国家的代表们访问苏联。他说，你们看一看在革命前生活在殖民主义压迫下的各族人民的生活，他们现在自由而幸福地生活着，你们就会相信，帝国主义者关于“共产主义奴隶”的谰言是多么荒谬。
    赫鲁晓夫最后祝客人们生活顺利，并希望他们在争取非洲国家的独立和幸福的斗争中取得成就。
