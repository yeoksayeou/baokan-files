A New Phenomenon in Socialist Construction

For more than two years, many large enterprises in various regions have developed into comprehensive joint enterprises. As of the end of June this year, more than 2,100 of the 2,900+ enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have developed diversified operations, establishing 13,945 diversified production units, an average of more than six per enterprise. Many enterprises have even set up dozens or even more than one hundred small factories, workshops, or engineering departments. Now, many small enterprises, as well as basic construction, transportation, commerce, grain and other departments, have also generally developed diversified operations. The content of diversified operations includes the production of raw materials such as steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemicals, the production of building materials such as cement and red bricks, the production of supporting parts, tools, equipment, and auxiliary materials, and the production of daily necessities and non-staple foods, among which the comprehensive utilization of various waste materials is the most common. The output value of diversified operations accounted for about 5% of the province's total industrial output value in 1959, and rose to about 10% of the province's total industrial output value in the first half of 1960. Due to the development of diversified operations, many enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have now formed comprehensive joint enterprises with a preliminary scale. For example, the Hegang Mining Bureau has more than ten systems of production, including raw coal, coal washing, in-mine railway transportation, steel, mining machinery, building materials, plumbing equipment, underground production materials, comprehensive utilization of coal and wood, daily necessities, and non-staple foods, with more than 180 larger diversified operation production units; Harbin Flax Mill, in addition to flax textile, has built 41 production units including steel, machinery, chemical raw materials, comprehensive utilization of textile remnants, auxiliary materials, packaging supplies, woodwork, building materials, clothing, and non-staple foods. In 1959, the output value of diversified operations accounted for 12.8% of the total plant output value. Mudanjiang Paper Mill has set up a total of 33 diversified operation production units, and has now formed a production system from grass fiber to paper output, with 40% to 80% of the three basic materials needed, namely bleaching powder, pulp, and caustic soda, being able to be self-sufficient. Jiamusi Friendship Sugar Factory, in addition to sugar production, has now built 66 production units including steel, coke, machinery, building materials, dry pulp, phosphate fertilizer, acids and alkalis, and animal husbandry. From January to June this year, the output value of diversified operations accounted for 45.43% of the total plant output value. In short, judging from the situation in Heilongjiang Province, the diversified operations of enterprises have become a huge force in industrial production and construction.

The Five Major Advantages of Diversified Operations

From the practice of industrial enterprises in Heilongjiang Province developing diversified operations in the past two years, it can be seen that enterprises implementing diversified operations have huge advantages.

First, it broke the original industry restrictions and promoted the spirit of self-reliance. Enterprises solved some of the problems in raw materials, supporting parts, auxiliary materials, equipment, and tools by their own efforts, supplementing the shortcomings of national planning and collaboration, thus effectively guaranteeing the development of the main business production. For example, Harbin Bearing Factory's bearing production targets leaped again and again in 1958. The special instruments and grinding wheels, which had always relied on imports from other places and foreign countries, could not keep up with the needs in terms of quantity and time, so they started to produce them themselves. By 1959, self-produced instruments could be completely self-sufficient, and also supported 61 fraternal units, and some were exported to supply fraternal countries. The problem of incomplete grinding wheel varieties was also solved, and the cost was reduced by half. Now they have also set up workshops, engineering departments, and factories producing more than 70 kinds of products such as steel, building materials, abrasives, high-frequency electric spindles, pneumatic chucks, and rubber cloth tubes, a total of 62 diversified operation units. More than a dozen kinds of products that originally relied on supplies from other units have achieved self-sufficiency or surplus, turning a single enterprise that originally only produced bearings into a comprehensive joint enterprise with a preliminary scale. Not only in state-owned large factories like Harbin Bearing Factory does the implementation of diversified operations have great advantages, but this advantage is also very obvious in local state-owned small factories. For example, Jiamusi Electric Factory is a relatively small factory established in the mass movement of running industries by the whole people in 1958. Their main business is the production of transformers and other electrical equipment. This year, the originally planned production target was increased by 64% compared with last year. At the beginning of the year, they encountered the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but under the slogan of "workshops running factories, producing raw materials, subsidiary factories competing with parent factories, production doubling and redoubling," and "using large materials to encompass small materials, piecing together whole materials with broken materials, turning waste materials into good materials, not losing every ounce," they vigorously developed diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. The whole factory set up 15 small "satellite factories" to produce urgently needed auxiliary materials such as welding rods and calcium carbide. The utilization rate of marginal waste materials in the factory jumped from 65% to 95%. Similar examples of diversified operations guaranteeing the development of main business production and guaranteeing the realization of continuous leap forward are everywhere in the movement of vigorously developing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization.

Second, it can fully exploit the potential of equipment, funds, and technical forces, fully utilize material resources, and greatly increase social wealth. First of all, due to enterprises tapping potential and implementing diversified operations, developing from single-product production to multi-product production, this is actually equivalent to building a large number of new enterprises without national investment. Secondly, enterprises implementing diversified operations generally include comprehensive utilization, which is actually "turning stone into gold" and extracting treasures from waste. For example, judging from the situation in Heilongjiang Province, comprehensive utilization has now spread to all aspects of coal, wood, oil, marginal waste materials, agricultural and sideline products, wild plants, livestock and poultry bones, blood, internal organs, hides, and various waste slags, waste liquids, waste steam, waste water, waste bran, and waste shells of enterprises. According to statistics from Qiqihar City alone, more than 150 kinds of materials have been comprehensively utilized, producing more than 1,300 kinds of products. In the past, these wastes either perished naturally on the ground, rotted naturally, or piled up like mountains in enterprises, requiring hired vehicles for external transportation; or they smelled offensive, disturbing the neighbors; or they were discarded into rivers, polluting the water; or they were burned to ashes. Now they have all become wealth that can be comprehensively utilized, "turning useless into useful, one use into multiple uses, small use into large use, harmful into beneficial," thereby greatly increasing product varieties and rapidly expanding social wealth.

Third, it promoted the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements and improved the production technology level of enterprises. This effect is mainly manifested in the following two aspects: First, due to the development of diversified operations, many enterprises were able to produce their own steel and mechanical equipment, creating favorable conditions for the technical transformation of enterprises. For example, Jiamusi Wood Processing Factory, due to the development of diversified operations, used steel produced by themselves to manufacture equipment, making the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of production increase from about 58% to nearly 90%. Second, diversified operations and comprehensive utilization promoted the development of mass scientific and technological research activities and expanded the fields of production technology mastered by employees. For example, Harbin Songjiang Canned Food Factory could only produce various canned foods such as meat, vegetables, and fruits. After implementing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, they widely carried out mass scientific and technological research activities, seeking teachers and visiting friends, learning and creating in combination. Now, in their own words, they have "jumped out of the canned food box," and can produce more than 50 kinds of products from a chicken alone. There are also some enterprises that have mastered the production technology of certain "high, precise, and cutting-edge" products due to the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization.

Fourth, the development of diversified operations by enterprises created conditions for employees' families to participate in social labor, and promoted the consolidation and development of urban people's communes. After enterprises developed diversified operations, the original labor force was insufficient. The solution was to transfer labor saved from the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and to absorb employees' families to participate in production. Some enterprises also allocate a part of the work process to organize street residents to carry out production, or cooperate with communes to establish "satellite factories." For example, Qiqihar City formed more than 160 large streets, large courtyards, and large buildings where residents were employed through the development of diversified operations by enterprises. In this way, the vast majority of employees' families in the city have gained employment opportunities. At the same time, due to the participation of employees' families in production, a large number of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, and service stations have also been established accordingly. Therefore, the implementation of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization by enterprises is of great help to the unified organization of urban residents' production and life by urban people's communes.

Fifth, the implementation of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization by enterprises has also had a profound impact on the ideological situation of enterprise employees. In the past, some of our enterprises, especially larger enterprises, generally only managed production, and other problems were arranged and solved by the state and local governments. Everyone thought this was a matter of course. After the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, this situation has changed greatly. Everyone took the initiative to solve some problems that they could solve. In the words of some enterprise cadres, they have now changed from "waiting for rice to cook" to "finding rice to cook," that is, the ideology of self-reliance has been greatly strengthened. In the past, in our enterprises, some units were large and wealthy, and marginal waste materials and various waste materials were discarded on the ground without feeling sorry. After the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, this situation has also changed greatly. "No waste gas in the sky, no waste water on the ground, no waste in the factory" has become a mass slogan. "From the edge of large pieces to branches and debris," everything is regarded as wealth and utilized. The practice of running enterprises diligently and frugally has been further promoted. The establishment and promotion of this ideology of self-reliance and running enterprises diligently and frugally is of course not simply due to the implementation of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. However, there is no doubt that the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization has had a strong promoting effect on the growth of this ideological atmosphere. In turn, this ideological atmosphere has further promoted the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization.

The above is what we have seen in the obvious effects of industrial enterprises in Heilongjiang Province carrying out diversified operations in the past two years. Although these are only displayed when enterprises start to implement diversified operations, they have fully demonstrated that the implementation of diversified operations by enterprises is a path to develop production in a faster, better, and more economical way, and at the same time, it has also produced beneficial effects in political and social life.

Products of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune

The practice of the past two years has made us realize that the development of diversified operations by enterprises is not an accidental and isolated phenomenon, but a product of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement. In turn, it has also enriched the content of the Party's general line for socialist construction and promoted the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement.

The diversified operations of enterprises are, first of all, the product of the vast number of cadres and employees, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, demanding to develop production faster, breaking superstitions, and liberating their minds. The Party's general line for socialist construction requires mobilizing all positive factors to accelerate socialist construction. The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises is precisely an effective method to fully mobilize the internal positive factors of enterprises, make the best use of people's talents, make the best use of materials, and make the best use of equipment, thereby developing production in a faster, better, and more economical way. The Party's general line for socialist construction requires the implementation of a series of "walking on two legs" policies to accelerate socialist construction. The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises does not mean that collaboration is not needed, nor does it mean that they are going to do things beyond their capabilities, nor does it mean unlimited expansion of enterprise scale and addition of personnel. Rather, it means using the original manpower and equipment, using waste and substandard materials, and expanding production through self-reliance. Therefore, the implementation of diversified operations by enterprises is actually a concrete manifestation of the general line.

The diversified operations of enterprises emerged in the Great Leap Forward. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the whole society launched a mass movement of running industries and steelmaking by the whole people. Under the enlightenment of Comrade Mao Zedong that enterprises should develop into comprehensive joint enterprises, many enterprises began to develop diversified operations at this time. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, due to the rapid development of production, various enterprises constantly generated some new production needs. This need greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of enterprises to implement diversified operations and promoted the continued development of diversified operations. The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises, "doing whatever is lacking, supplementing whatever is lacking," made it possible for enterprises to solve some of the problems of raw materials, equipment, parts, tools, etc. through self-reliance, thereby guaranteeing the continuous leap forward of production. From the perspective of the entire society, the potential of various enterprises to implement diversified operations and vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization is also an important component of promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. Therefore, the development and results of diversified operations by enterprises are inseparable from the Great Leap Forward.

The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises is closely related to the People's Commune movement, especially the large-scale development of urban People's Communes. Judging from the situation in Heilongjiang Province, as mentioned above, the diversified operations of enterprises first began to appear in the mass movement of running industries by the whole people in 1958. The movement of running industries by the whole people was an important content of the People's Commune movement. Subsequently, with the formal establishment and development of urban People's Communes, the diversified operations of enterprises also developed accordingly. After the establishment of the People's Commune, it organized employees' families and other urban residents to participate in production labor, and subsequently developed mass collective welfare undertakings, providing labor and social conditions for enterprises to develop diversified operations. The development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization by enterprises also provided material conditions for communes to develop production and organize residents' employment. Now, in some places, under the unified leadership of the commune, large, medium, and small enterprises that are closely related in production are organized together to form joint enterprises, which further promotes the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization by enterprises. Facts show that without urban People's Communes, the diversified operations of enterprises could not have developed so rapidly.

A Major Change in Enterprise Management Policies

The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises is a major change in enterprise management policies, and it is impossible not to encounter ideological resistance. Judging from the situation in Heilongjiang Province, the main ideological resistance encountered at the beginning was a mechanical and absolute "specialization" ideology. Some people believe that enterprises can only implement specialization, and the more specialized the better. Only specialization can adopt assembly lines, adopt advanced technology, and improve labor productivity, and can reduce costs. The implementation of diversified operations is "not doing one's job properly" and will "hinder the main business." The actual results of enterprises implementing diversified operations in the past two years have fully proved that their views are completely untenable.

The "specialization" advocates believe that the implementation of specialization can adopt assembly lines, adopt advanced technology, and improve labor productivity, which is of course correct in a certain sense. We do not oppose this kind of specialization in the production process. In fact, many of our modern enterprises organize production in this way. The problem is that they oppose specialization and diversified operations, believing that diversified operations will hinder specialization and hinder the improvement of technology and labor productivity. They do not see that diversified operations are precisely conducive to the technological transformation of enterprises and the improvement of labor productivity. Because the matter is very clear, adopting advanced technology, implementing assembly lines, etc. requires equipment, and therefore requires steel and the mechanical processing capacity to manufacture equipment. After enterprises implement diversified operations, they can produce their own steel and machinery to arm themselves, without having to completely wait for the state to renovate equipment for each enterprise. This is a kind of self-reliance and mass line approach in technological transformation, which is an important point where diversified operations are superior to mechanical specialization, and not a shortcoming of diversified operations.

The "specialization" advocates believe that the implementation of specialization can reduce costs, which is also correct for a single product, but they do not look at the issue of saving from the perspective of the entire enterprise and the entire society. They did not see that due to the development of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization by enterprises, the waste materials were fully utilized, the efficiency of equipment was fully utilized, and part of the long-distance transportation costs of goods purchased from other places in the past was saved, which is the greatest saving. At the same time, this saving does not exclude and affect the saving generated by the specialization of production. They did not see that some of our enterprises have achieved the amazing fact of "main business production without cost" due to the implementation of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization.

It should be admitted that the "specialization" advocates also understand that an enterprise cannot carry out production in isolation. However, they believe that this can only be solved by the state's unified allocation and cooperation between enterprises. There is no doubt that the state's unified allocation and cooperation are not only completely necessary now, but will also be completely necessary in the future. But the problem is: why must we tie up the hands and feet of enterprises, so that they can only passively wait for the state to arrange every detail for them, completely relying on other enterprises to meet their countless cooperation requirements, and not allow enterprises to exert their initiative to solve some of the problems that can be solved themselves? Is it not more proactive and more active to combine the state's unified allocation, cooperation between enterprises, and enterprises' own diversified operations under the guidance of the state's unified plan than to completely rely on the state's allocation and cooperation between enterprises?

The "specialization" advocates believe that diversified operations are "not doing one's job properly" and will "hinder the main business." Another reason is that engaging in diversified operations will distract forces and hinder the concentration of energy of enterprise leaders. This is also a statement that knows one but does not know the other. Of course, enterprises engaging in diversified operations will distract some energy and forces, but this distraction of energy and forces can be completely compensated and more than compensated from the benefits of diversified operations. Because if diversified operations are not developed, all problems of raw materials, equipment, supporting facilities, and even employees' lives must rely on the help of the state, local governments, and other units, and a lot of energy and manpower must be allocated to engage in materials and cooperation. Energy and forces must also be distracted. However, after diversified operations are developed, many problems can be solved within the scope of the factory itself, and the needs of main business production are more guaranteed, and the solution of problems is more timely. Comparing the two, it is obvious that the implementation of diversified operations is not distracting but precisely concentrating energy and forces.

In summary, it can be completely seen that each point of view of the "specialization" advocates is extremely one-sided. Their fundamental error lies in their isolating and absolutizing specialization, and having a dogmatic and metaphysical understanding of specialization. They do not understand that the development of social production, from the synthesis of the handicraft era, to the specialization after machine production, to the new synthesis, is an objective need to adapt to the development of productive forces. The comprehensive joint enterprise combines specialization and diversified operations. Compared with the primary synthesis of handicrafts, it is a more advanced synthesis. This process of affirmation-negation-affirmation of the development of things is an objective law, and it is the dialectical process of the development of things. Therefore, our disagreement with the "specialization" advocates on the issue of diversified operations by enterprises is essentially a disagreement between dialectics and metaphysics, and a disagreement between Mao Zedong Thought and dogmatism.

Mao Zedong Thought is a living dialectic. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a large number of new things have emerged in our socialist construction. The implementation of diversified operations by enterprises and the development towards comprehensive joint enterprises is a concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought in the industrial construction policy. Now, the development of this new thing is still in its heyday, and its correctness and vitality have been proven by facts. Our task is to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the direction of enterprises developing diversified operations, and promptly summarize experience and correctly handle the new problems that arise in planning, material management, financial management, and cooperative relations with the development of diversified operations, so that this new thing of great significance can be further developed and improved, so that our socialist construction can continue to advance in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    多种经营是工业企业多快好省地发展生产之路
    李曦沐
    社会主义建设事业中的新事物
    两年多来，各地都有不少大企业向综合性的联合企业发展。截至今年6月底，黑龙江省二千九百多个企业已有二千一百多个发展了多种经营，共举办了多种经营的生产单位一万三千九百四十五个，平均每个企业办了六个以上，其中有不少企业办起了几十个直到一百多个小厂、车间或工部。现在，许多小企业以至基本建设、交通运输、商业、粮食等部门也都普遍地发展了多种经营。多种经营的内容，包括了钢铁、有色金属、化工等原材料的生产，水泥、红砖等建筑材料的生产，配套部件、工具、设备及辅助材料的生产，日用品和副食品生产等各个方面，而其中最普遍的则是各种废弃物资的综合利用。多种经营的产值，1959年占全省工业总产值的5％左右，1960年上半年上升至占全省工业总产值的10％左右，由于多种经营的发展，现在黑龙江省已有不少企业形成了初具规模的综合性联合企业。例如鹤岗矿务局，已拥有原煤、洗煤、矿内铁路运输、钢铁、矿山机械、建筑材料、水暖器材、井下生产材料、煤和木材的综合利用、日用品及副食品等十余个系统的生产，较大的多种经营生产单位就有一百八十多个；哈尔滨亚麻厂除亚麻纺织外，已建有钢铁、机械、化工原料、纺织剩余物综合利用、辅助材料、包装用品、木器、建筑材料、被服、副食品等四十一个生产单位，1959年多种经营部分的产值占全厂总产值的12.8％。牡丹江造纸厂共办了多种经营生产单位三十三个，现已形成从草纤维到出纸的生产系统，所需要的漂白粉、纸浆、火碱三项基本材料，已有40％至80％可以自给。佳木斯友谊糖厂，除制糖外，现已建有钢铁、焦炭、机械、建筑材料、干粕、磷肥、酸碱、畜牧等六十六个生产单位，今年1至6月多种经营部分的产值占全厂总产值的45.43％。总之，从黑龙江省的情况看来，企业的多种经营已经成为工业生产建设中的一支巨大力量。
            多种经营的五大优越性
    从两年来黑龙江省工业企业发展多种经营的实践中可以看出，企业实行多种经营有着巨大的优越性。
    第一，打破了原来行业的限制，发扬了自力更生的精神。企业自己动手解决了一部分原材料、配套部件、辅助材料和设备、工具等方面的问题，补充了国家计划和协作之不足，从而有力地保证了主业生产的发展。例如哈尔滨轴承厂，在1958年轴承生产指标一跃再跃，原来一直依靠从外地和外国进货的专用仪表和砂轮，在数量和时间上都跟不上需要，他们就自己动手来生产。到1959年自产仪表已经可以完全自给，并且支援了六十一个兄弟单位，还有一部分出口供应了兄弟国家，原来砂轮品种不全的问题也得到了解决，并且降低了一半成本。现在他们又办起了生产钢铁、建筑材料、磨料、高频电主轴、气动卡具、胶布管等七十余种产品的车间、工部、工厂，共六十二个多种经营单位，已有十几种原来依靠外单位供应的产品作到了自给或自给有余，使原来只生产轴承一种产品的单一企业，变成了一个初具规模的综合性联合企业，两年来生产不断增长。不仅在像哈尔滨轴承厂这样的国营大厂中，实行多种经营有很大的优越性，这种优越性在地方国营小厂中也表现得很明显。如佳木斯电工厂就是在1958年全民办工业的运动中兴办起来的一个较小的工厂。他们的主业是生产变压器等电工器材，今年原订生产计划比去年提高64％，年初一开始就遇到了原材料不足的困难，但是他们在“车间办工厂，生产原材料，子厂赛母厂，生产大翻番”、“大料套小料，碎料凑整料，废料变好料，斤两不丢掉”的口号下，大搞多种经营、综合利用，全厂共办起了十五个小“卫星厂”，生产了焊条、电石等急需的辅助材料，厂内边材废料的利用率由65％一跃提高到95％。类似这样多种经营保证主业生产发展、保证实现持续跃进的例子，在大搞多种经营、综合利用的运动中是到处可见的。
    第二，可以充分发挥设备、资金、技术力量等潜力，充分利用物资资源，大大增加社会财富。首先，由于企业挖掘潜力，实行多种经营，由单一品种生产发展为多品种生产，这实际上就等于不用国家投资新建了大批的企业。其次，企业实行多种经营，一般都包括有综合利用的内容，这实际上是“点石成金”，从废物中取宝。例如从黑龙江省的情况看来，目前综合利用已遍及煤、木、油、边材废料、农副产品、野生植物、畜禽骨血脏皮及企业的各种废渣、废液、废汽、废水、废糠、废壳等各个方面。仅据齐齐哈尔市统计，已被综合利用的物资即有一百五十多种，生产出一千三百多种产品。过去这些废物或在大地上自生自灭，自然腐烂或在企业中堆积如山，需要雇车外运；或臭气熏人，四邻不安；或弃之江河，污染流水；或付之一炬，烟消云散；而现在都成为可资综合利用的财富，
  “无用变有用，一用变多用，小用变大用，有害变有利”，产品品种由此大量增加，社会财富由此迅速扩大。
    第三，促进了技术革新、技术革命运动的发展和企业生产技术水平的提高。这种作用主要表现在如下两个方面：一是由于多种经营的开展，许多企业能够自己生产钢铁和机械设备，为企业的技术改造创造了有利的条件。如佳木斯木材加工厂就由于开展了多种经营，用自己生产的钢铁制造设备，使生产的机械化、半机械化程度由原来的58％左右提高到近90％。二是多种经营、综合利用促进了群众性的科学技术研究活动的开展，扩大了职工掌握生产技术的领域。如哈尔滨松江罐头厂原来只能生产肉类、蔬菜、果品等各种罐头，在实行了多种经营、综合利用之后，他们广泛地开展了群众性的科学技术研究活动，求师访友，学创结合，现在用他们自己的话来说，已经“跳出了罐头盒子”，仅从鸡的身上就可以生产出五十多种产品。也还有一些企业由于开展了多种经营、综合利用，掌握了某些
  “高、精、尖”产品的生产技术。
    第四，企业多种经营的发展，为职工家属参加社会劳动创造了条件，促进了城市人民公社的巩固和发展。企业发展了多种经营之后，原来的劳动力就不足了，解决的办法，一个是从技术革新、技术革命运动节省出来的劳动力中调剂，一个是吸收职工家属参加生产。也有一些企业是拨出一部分工序，组织街道居民进行生产，或与公社合作兴办“卫星厂”。如齐齐哈尔市就通过企业发展多种经营，形成了一百六十多处居民职工化的大街、大院、大楼。这样，就使城市绝大部分职工家属得到了就业的机会。同时，由于职工家属参加了生产，又相应地举办了大量的公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、服务站等集体福利事业。因此，企业实行多种经营、综合利用，对于城市人民公社统一组织城市居民的生产和生活，是有很大帮助的。
    第五，企业实行多种经营、综合利用，对企业职工的思想状况也发生了深刻的影响。过去，我们有一些企业，特别是较大的企业，一般都是只管生产，其他问题都靠国家和地方安排解决。大家认为这是理所当然之事。在开展多种经营、综合利用之后，这种情况已有很大改变，大家动手解决了一些自己可能解决的问题，用有些企业干部的话来说，现在是由“等米下锅”变成“找米下锅”了，也就是说自力更生的思想大大加强了。过去，在我们的企业里，有些单位家大业大，边材角料和各种废弃物资，抛弃于地不觉得可惜，在开展了多种经营、综合利用之后，这种情况也有了很大改变。“天上无废气，地上无废水，厂内无废物”已成为群众性的口号。“从块头边角到枝枒渣沫”，无一不被视为财富，加以利用。勤俭办企业的风气进一步发扬起来了。这种自力更生和勤俭办企业的思想的树立和发扬，当然不只是单纯由于实行了多种经营、综合利用之故，但是毫无疑问，多种经营、综合利用的开展，对这种思想风气的成长发生了有力的促进作用，反过来这种思想风气又进一步促进了多种经营、综合利用的发展。
    以上所说，就是从黑龙江省工业企业两年以来开展多种经营中所看到的一些明显的效果。这些虽然还只是在企业开始实行多种经营时所显示出来的，但是它们已经可以充分证明：企业实行多种经营乃是一条多快好省地发展生产的道路，同时在政治上和社会生活中也都产生了有益的影响。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社的产物
    两年来的实践使我们体会到：企业的多种经营的发展不是一种偶然的、孤立的现象，而是总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动的产物，反过来，它也充实了党的社会主义建设总路线的内容，对大跃进和人民公社化运动发生了促进的作用。
    企业的多种经营，首先是在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导和鼓舞下，广大干部和职工要求更快地发展生产，破除迷信，解放思想的产物。党的社会主义建设总路线要求调动一切积极因素加速建设社会主义，企业实行多种经营，正是充分地调动企业内部的积极因素，使人尽其材，物尽其用，设备尽其能，从而多快好省地发展生产的一种有效方法。党的社会主义建设总路线要求实行一系列“两条腿走路”的方针来加速社会主义建设，企业实行多种经营，并不是不要协作了，也不是要去办那些力所不及的事情，更不是无限制扩大企业规模和增添人员，而是利用原有的人力和设备，利用废次材料，自力更生地扩大生产。因此，企业实行多种经营实际上是总路线的一种具体化的表现。
    企业的多种经营是在大跃进中应运而生的。在1958年的大跃进中，全社会兴起了全民办工业全民办钢铁的运动，在毛泽东同志关于企业要向综合性的联合企业发展的启示下，许多企业都开始在这个时候办起了多种经营。在社会主义建设的连续大跃进中，由于生产的猛烈发展，各个企业都不断地产生了一些生产上的新的需要，这种需要极大地鼓舞了企业实行多种经营的积极性，促进了多种经营的继续发展。企业实行了多种经营，“缺啥搞啥，少啥补啥”，这就使企业有可能去自力更生地解决一部分原材料、设备、部件、工具等问题，从而保证了生产的不断跃进。各个企业发挥潜力实行多种经营、大搞综合利用，从整个社会看来，也正是促进生产大跃进的一个重要的组成部分。因此，企业的多种经营的发展及其结果都是与大跃进密不可分的。
    企业实行多种经营，与人民公社化运动，特别是大办城市人民公社有密切的关系。从黑龙江省的情况看来，如上所述，企业的多种经营，最初就是在1958年全民大办工业的运动中开始出现的，而全民办工业的运动正是人民公社化运动的一个重要内容。其后，随着城市人民公社的正式建立和发展，企业的多种经营也随之而日益发展起来。人民公社建立以后，组织职工家属和其他城市居民参加生产劳动，并随之发展了群众的集体福利事业，为企业发展多种经营提供了劳动力，提供了社会条件。企业发展多种经营和综合利用也为公社发展生产、组织居民就业提供了物质条件。现在有的地方还在公社的统一领导下，把在生产上关系密切的大中小企业组织在一起，组成联合企业，这就更加促进了企业的多种经营、综合利用的发展。事实表明：离开城市人民公社，企业的多种经营是不可能得到这样迅速的发展的。
        是企业经营方针的重大变革
    企业实行多种经营是企业经营方针上的一个重大变革，不可能不遇到思想上的阻力。从黑龙江省的情况看来，开始遇到的思想阻力主要是一种机械的、绝对的“专业化”思想。有的人认为企业只能实行专业化，越专业化越好，只有专业化才能采用流水作业线，采用先进技术，提高劳动生产率，才能降低成本，而实行多种经营就是“不务正业”，就会“妨碍本行”。两年来企业实行多种经营的实际结果充分证明：他们的这些观点是完全站不住脚的。
    “专业化”论者认为实行专业化可以采用流水作业线，采用先进技术，提高劳动生产率，这在一定意义上当然是正确的，我们并不反对这种生产过程中的专业化，事实上我们的许多现代化企业正是这样来组织生产的。问题在于他们把专业化和多种经营对立起来，认为多种经营就会妨碍专业化，妨碍提高技术和劳动生产率，而没有看到多种经营恰恰有利于企业的技术改造和劳动生产率的提高。因为事情很明白，采用先进技术，实行流水作业线等等是需要设备的，因而是需要钢铁和制造设备的机械加工能力的，而企业实行多种经营之后，就可以自己生产钢铁和机械，用来武装自己，而不必完全等待国家来为每一个企业改装设备。这正是技术改造中的一种自力更生和群众路线的作法，这正是多种经营优越于机械的专业化的一个重要之点，而并不是多种经营的缺点。
      “专业化”论者认为实行专业化可以降低成本，这对于一件产品来说也是正确的，但他们没有从整个企业和整个社会来看待节约的问题。他们没有看到，由于企业开展了多种经营、综合利用，把废弃的物资充分利用起来，把设备的效能充分发挥起来，把过去从外地进货的一部分远途运输费节约起来，这正是最大的节约。同时，这种节约并不排斥和影响由生产的专业化中所产生的节约。他们更没有看到我们有些企业由于实行了多种经营、综合利用，而实现了“主业生产无成本”的这个惊人的事实。
    应该承认，“专业化”论者也是懂得一个企业是不能孤立地进行生产的。但是他们认为这只能靠国家的统一调拨和企业间的协作来解决问题。毫无疑问，国家的统一调拨和协作不但在现在，在今后也是完全必要的。但问题在于：我们为什么必须把企业的手足束缚起来，让他们只能被动地完全等待国家来替他们安排每一个细节，完全依靠别的企业来满足他们数不清的协作要求，而不可以发挥企业的主动性来自己解决可能解决的一部分问题呢？难道在国家统一计划的指导之下，把国家的统一调拨、企业间的协作和企业自己的多种经营这三者结合起来，不是比完全依靠国家调拨和企业间的协作更主动得多，更活动得多吗？
      “专业化”论者认为多种经营是“不务正业”，会“妨碍本行”，还有一个理由，就是搞多种经营会分散力量，妨碍企业领导者精力的集中。这也是知其一而不知其二的说法。当然，企业搞多种经营是要分散一些精力和力量的，但是这个精力和力量的分散，完全可以从多种经营的好处中得到补偿而有余。因为如果不发展多种经营，一切原材料、设备、配套以至职工生活等方面的问题都要依靠国家、地方和别的单位帮助解决，就势必要分出大量的精力和人力去搞材料、搞协作，精力和力量同样是要分散的；但发展了多种经营之后，许多问题就可以自己在本厂的范围内解决了，主业生产的需要就更有保证了，问题的解决就更及时了；二者相较，显然实行多种经营并不是分散了而恰恰是集中了精力和力量。
    综上所述，完全可以看出，“专业化”论者的每一个论点，都是有极大的片面性的。他们的根本错误在于他们把专业化孤立起来，绝对化起来，对专业化抱着一种教条主义的、形而上学的了解。他们不了解：社会生产的发展，从手工业时代的综合，到机器生产以后的专业化，再到新的综合，乃是适应于生产力发展的一种客观需要；综合性联合企业把专业化和多种经营结合起来，对于手工业的初级的综合，乃是一种更高级的综合；这种事物发展的肯定——否定——肯定的过程正是一种客观规律，正是事物发展的辩证过程。因此，我们在企业的多种经营问题上和“专业化”论者的分歧，实质上乃是辩证法同形而上学的分歧，乃是毛泽东思想同教条主义的分歧。　　毛泽东思想是活生生的辩证法。在毛泽东思想的指导下，我国社会主义建设出现了大量的新事物，企业实行多种经营，向综合性的联合企业发展，就是毛泽东思想在工业建设方针上的一个具体表现。现在，这个新事物的发展还正处于方兴未艾之时，它的正确性和生命力已经为事实所证明，我们的任务就是要高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持企业发展多种经营的方向，并及时总结经验，正确处理随着多种经营的发展在计划、物资管理、财务管理以及协作关系等方面出现的新问题，使这个有重大意义的新事物进一步发展和完善起来，使我们的社会主义建设继续多快好省地前进。
