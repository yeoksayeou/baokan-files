    National Celebration, Universal Rejoicing
    -- On the Burmese People's Enthusiastic Acclaim for the Completion of the China-Burma Friendship Mansion
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Jie Lifu, Feng Guang
    When the news of the signing of the China-Burma Boundary Treaty in Beijing on October 1st arrived, the Burmese people were overjoyed and immersed in this happy news. The peace-loving Burmese people regarded the day the treaty was signed as one of the auspicious days in their history.

    In these exciting days, many Burmese parties and mass organizations launched various celebrations of the signing of the China-Burma Boundary Treaty and China-Burma friendship activities. On the morning of October 2nd, the Burmese government and various parties and mass organizations jointly held a grand mass meeting. On this day, twenty Chinese and Burmese national flags fluttered in front of the Yangon City Hall, and a huge banner with the words "Celebrating the Signing of the China-Burma Boundary Treaty" hung on the door. The corridors of the City Hall were brightly lit and gongs and drums were sounding, creating a very warm atmosphere. As soon as we entered the hall, many Burmese friends came forward to shake our hands and congratulate us: "Let our two peoples cheer heartily on this auspicious day!" "May the friendship between our two peoples develop further!" Among those attending the meeting that day were senior Burmese government officials, leaders of various parties and organizations, and representatives from all walks of life. There were also representatives of various ethnic minorities from Burma who had recently come to Yangon to attend the celebration. They represented the wishes of the 20 million people of Burma and praised the great friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples with the most beautiful words. Burmese Foreign Minister Sao Khun Hkio said: "Thanks to the efforts of the governments and peoples of our two countries, this China-Burma Friendship Mansion, which we have long awaited, has finally been completed." He called on the Burmese people to further consolidate this mansion and make China-Burma friendship last forever! Foreign Minister Sao Khun Hkio's words won warm applause from the masses present. Man Liumao, a Kachin representative from the China-Burma border, said: "The people in the border areas of China and Burma jointly drink the water of the Nu River (Salween River), the Taiping River (Daying River), and the Youchuan River (Ruili River). The Burmese people call the Chinese people 'Pauk Phaw,' meaning brothers, which is closer than relatives. Now, the China-Burma border issue has been resolved through peaceful consultation, which is really exciting." Man Liumao's words sparked enthusiastic cheers from the audience: "Long live! Dear Pauk Phaw!" "Long live! China-Burma Boundary Treaty!"

    In order to express the friendly wishes and joyful feelings of the two peoples, the Burma-China Friendship Association and other Burmese mass organizations held celebration parties in succession that evening. The Burmese people and Chinese residing in Yangon rejoiced and danced together. Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, they sang out the wishes of the two peoples together. Listen! How loudly they sing:
    "Doves of peace fly in the sky,
    We sing with joy,
    Singing that the China-Burma Boundary Treaty is signed,
    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence shine brightly.
    All disputes can be negotiated,
    China and Burma have set a good example.
    The imperialists' plot to sow discord has gone bankrupt,
    China and Burma have realized their long-cherished ideals.
    Beijing - Yangon,
    Flowers of peace are in full bloom, the Five Principles shine brightly.
        …………"
    In the past few days, we Chinese in Yangon have been warmly congratulated everywhere. Whether on the streets or in the alleys, Burmese friends greeted the Chinese warmly: "Dear Pauk Phaw, hello!" Many Burmese friends also shouted in the Chinese they had recently learned: "Burmese and Chinese people are brothers, long live Burma-China friendship!" Many Burmese friends have told us about their inner joy over the China-Burma Boundary Treaty. Dr. Htin Aung, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, said: "The signing of the China-Burma Boundary Treaty is not only a common victory for the peoples of our two countries, but also a victory for the peace-loving people of Asia. The imperialists' plot to sow discord has been a complete failure for China and Burma, like pouring water on sand." Wu Ba Swe, head of the Burmese Cultural Friendship Delegation who had visited China, said: "When I led the Burmese cultural and artistic delegation to visit China, I was warmly received by the Chinese government and people, and I deeply felt that the Chinese people love peace and friendship. Now, the China-Burma border issue has been resolved in a peaceful and friendly spirit, which can be said to have set an example for all countries in the world."

    During these days when Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win visited China, the Burmese people eagerly hoped to learn about the activities of the Burmese delegation in China. In these days, the telephone of the Xinhua News Agency Yangon branch was constantly busy day and night, and the cars of the Burmese government and press to fetch news releases from the branch were also in constant stream. Especially on October 1st, the day the China-Burma Boundary Treaty was signed, our telephone rang as soon as it dawned. The earpiece was a primary school teacher speaking: "I am from Yangon No. 21 Primary School, please tell us the wavelength and time of the Beijing National Day broadcast recording." In less than five minutes, the telephone rang again. This time it was a Yangon newspaper asking us to send them the news of the signing of the China-Burma Boundary Treaty as soon as we received it. In this way, from morning to night, we had to answer thirty to forty telephone calls and receive more than a dozen visitors every day.

    Recently, books about China and Chinese films have also been particularly welcomed in Yangon. The manager of a bookstore took a Burmese book "History of the Chinese Revolution" published on October 1st and said to us: "This kind of book has sold more than 50 copies in less than an hour after being delivered."

    In the past two days, people from all walks of life in various parts of Burma have continued to hold rallies, cheering for the China-Burma Boundary Treaty and cheering for the completion of the China-Burma Friendship Mansion.

    举国欢腾万民同庆
    ——记缅甸人民热烈欢呼中缅友谊大厦的建成
    新华社记者　解力夫　冯光
    当十月一日中缅边界条约在北京签字的消息传来后，缅甸人民欢欣鼓舞，沉浸在这个幸福的喜讯中。爱好和平的缅甸人民把条约签字这一天，当成他们历史上吉祥的日子之一。
    在这激动人心的日子里，缅甸的许多党派和群众团体展开了各种各样的庆祝中缅边界条约签订和中缅友好活动。10月2日上午，缅甸政府和各党派、群众团体联合举行了一个规模盛大的群众大会。这一天，仰光市政厅门前飘扬着二十面中缅两国国旗，门上挂着：“庆祝中缅边界条约签订”的巨大标语。市政厅走廊内灯火辉煌，锣鼓齐鸣，气氛非常热烈。当我们一进大厅时，许多缅甸朋友纷纷向我们握手祝贺：“让我们两国人民在这吉祥的日子里，尽情的欢呼！”“祝两国人民的友谊进一步发展！”出席这一天会议的有缅甸政府高级官员、各党派团体领导人、各界代表。还有最近赶来仰光参加庆祝大会的缅甸各个少数民族的代表。他们代表着缅甸两千万人民的心意，用最美丽的词句赞颂着中缅两国人民的伟大友谊。缅甸联邦外交部长藻昆卓说：“由于两国政府和人民的努力，我们久已盼望的这座中缅友谊大厦终于落成了。”他号召缅甸人民进一步巩固这座大厦，使中缅友谊万古长青！”藻昆卓外长的话博得了到会群众的热烈鼓掌。来自中缅边境的克钦族代表曼柳貌说：“中缅两国边境地区的人民共同饮怒江（萨尔温江）、太平江（大盈江）和尤川江（瑞丽江）的水，缅甸人民把中国人民称之为‘胞波’意思是兄弟，这比亲戚还亲。现在两国又以和平协商的方法解决了中缅边界问题，实在令人兴奋。”曼柳貌的话引起了全场热烈的欢呼：“万岁！亲爱的胞波！”“万岁！中缅边界条约！”
    为了表达两国人民的友好的心愿和欢乐的感情，这一个夜晚，缅中友协和缅甸其他群众团体连续举行了庆祝晚会。缅甸人民和侨居在仰光的中国人在一起共同欢乐，共同歌舞。他们肩并着肩，手挽着手，共同唱出了两国人民的心愿。听！他们的歌声唱得多么响亮：
    “和平的鸽子在天空飞翔，
    我们喜气洋洋地歌唱，
    歌唱中缅边界条约签订了，
    和平共处五项原则放光芒。
    一切争端都可协商，
    中缅创造了好榜样。
    帝国主义挑拨离间的阴谋破产了，
    中缅实现多年的理想。
    北京——仰光，
    和平的花朵齐开放，五项原则放光芒。
        …………”
    这几天来，我们这些在仰光的中国人，到处都受到热情的祝贺。不论是在大街上还是在小巷里，缅甸朋友遇见中国人时，都是热情地招呼：“亲爱的胞波，你好！”许多缅甸朋友还用最近学会的中国话喊着：“缅中人民是兄弟，缅中友谊万岁！”缅甸的许多朋友都向我们叙述了对中缅边界条约内心的喜悦。缅中友协主席信波博士说：“中缅边界条约的签订，不仅是我们两国人民的共同胜利，而且也是亚洲热爱和平人民的胜利。帝国主义挑拨离间的阴谋，对中缅两国来说，却像水倒在沙土里一样惨败了”。曾经去过中国的缅甸文化友好代表团团长吴巴盛说：“在我率领缅甸文化艺术代表团访问中国时，曾受到中国政府和人民热情的款待，我深深地体会到中国人民是热爱和平和友好的。现在中缅边界问题以和平友好的精神予以解决，可以说是给世界各国树立了榜样。”
    在吴努总理和奈温将军访问中国的这些日子里，缅甸人民殷切地希望了解缅甸代表团在中国活动的情况。这些天来，新华社仰光分社的电话昼夜都是应接不暇，缅甸政府和报界来分社取新闻稿的车子也是络绎不绝。特别是在10月1日中缅边界条约签订那一天，天刚蒙蒙亮，我们的电话铃就响了。耳机中是一个小学教师在讲话：“我是仰光第二十一小学，请你告诉我们北京国庆广播实况录音的波长和时间。”不到五分钟电话铃又响了。这一次是仰光报让我们收到中缅边界条约签字的新闻以后马上给他们送去。就这样，从清晨到深夜我们每天总要迎接三四十次电话和十几起来访客人。
    近来，有关中国的书籍和中国影片在仰光也格外受到欢迎。一个书店的经理拿了一本10月1日出版的缅文书“中国革命史”对我们说：“这种书送来还不到一个小时就销售了五十多本”。
    这两天，缅甸各地各界人民还在纷纷继续举行集会，欢呼中缅边界条约，欢呼中缅友谊大厦的建成。
