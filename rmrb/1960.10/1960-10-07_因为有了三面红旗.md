    Because of the Three Red Banners
    Li Chong, First Secretary of the Jiangning County Party Committee, Jiangsu Province
    The September morning air is filled with the fragrance of rice, and a slight breeze brings a touch of coolness. Our inspection team stood on a hillside in the Qingxiu Brigade of the Jiangning Commune. The morning sun was dyeing the green hills a golden hue. Looking as far as the eye could see, patches of autumn-ripened crops resembled countless pieces of gold-threaded and intricately woven carpets. The dense and long ears of the japonica rice were heavy, turning the fields golden yellow. The sturdy corn on the slopes grew taller than a man’s head. The late rice paddies were a shiny, dark green. Glistening white water flowed along spiderweb-like canals, adding shimmering silver ribbons to this "carpet." The commune members were busy plowing, threshing, and the wind carried the commune members' loud songs.
    What a beautiful scene! Who could see any trace that this place had suffered a severe drought? In fact, from the beginning of August, more than 100,000 mu of rice in the county faced the crisis of dehydration and water depletion. In the thirty-odd days from August 5th, the total rainfall was only a little more than eight millimeters. "A drought in midsummer is not a drought, but an autumn drought means no grain." This drought struck at a critical moment. But what happened? This beautiful picture before our eyes is a microcosm of the entire county's countryside. All of this is because of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune!
    Yes, when talking about harvests in a drought year, how can we not talk about how good the Three Red Banners are! Opening up a "Jiangning Chronicle," historically this place has been prone to both drought and flooding. In those dark years, no one could count how many lives and properties the drought demon had seized, or how many tears of blood from the working people were in the Qinhuai River. In 1942, after only forty days without rain, most of the county's crops yielded nothing. Today, with the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, people have begun to become the masters of nature; the saying "Man will conquer nature" has become even more meaningful. Last year, the drought started before summer planting was completed, lasting for more than a hundred days. More than 50,000 ponds and dams in the county dried up, 90% of them completely bottom up. However, relying on the strong leadership of the Party, relying on the unparalleled power of the People's Commune, the people of the county drew water from the river when the ponds dried up, and drew water from the Yangtze River when the rivers dried up. If high mountains blocked the way, they conquered them! Dozens, even hundreds, of waterwheel arrays were set up, forcing the water to obediently cross the mountains. In this way, the drought demon lowered its head, and the county's rice production still increased compared to 1958. This year, when the drought demon made a comeback, the commune members said: "Ha! This God wants to test our People's Commune and our revolutionary spirit again!" Fine, let's test it! After more than forty days of "testing," it was revealed: The People's Commune, the people of the People's Commune era, had won, and that God? It lost again.
    One eloquent fact after another reflects the increasingly powerful and unparalleled power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. Under the unified planning and organization of manpower and materials in the People's Commune, in the past two years, the county has newly built 22 electric irrigation stations, 66 large and medium-sized reservoirs, 256 culverts, and more than 9,700 ponds and dams. In addition, more than 7,500 horsepower of new pumping machinery has been added. These projects have ensured drought and flood control for 580,000 mu of land.
    In the fight against drought, the spirit of great collaboration and great support, which represents the spirit of the People's Commune era, has emitted an even more brilliant light. Under the unified organization of the People's Commune and the principle of equal exchange of mutual assistance, each commune, each brigade, and each team shared what they had and helped each other in times of difficulty. The upstream took care of the downstream, those with water supported those lacking water, and if one place had difficulties, help came from all directions. The touching deeds of "leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others" occurred countless times every day. Last year, the ponds and dams of the Gully Commune, surrounded by mountains, dried up, and the rice was about to catch fire. As soon as the neighboring commune learned of the news, they immediately connected people to people, and vehicles to vehicles, traveling thirty miles, crossing more than ten mountains, one after another, transferring the water of the Yangtze River to this commune. In the fight against drought, the industrial departments sent machinery and technicians; the commercial departments sent equipment and daily necessities; the canteens' food carriers were delivered directly to the fields; doctors and health workers never left the front line of production... It was all of this that united the strength of the people into an invincible whole, withstood the drought, and won the victory.
    The powerful General Line, the power of the Great Leap Forward!
    The powerful power of the People's Commune!
    Relying on this power, we can do anything well.

    因为有了三面红旗
    中共江苏江宁县委第一书记　李崇
    9月的早晨，飘散着稻香的微风已带来丝丝凉意。我们检查团一行人站上江宁公社清修大队的一个山坡，朝阳正把翠岗绿岭染得一片金黄。极目四望，只见一片片的秋熟庄稼，恰像无数幅织金镂翠的地毯，中粳稻又密又长的穗头，沉甸甸地黄遍原野；坡地上茁壮的玉米长得比人头还高；晚稻田一片油光乌绿；白哗哗的水流沿着蛛网般的渠道流过，这块“地毯”上又镶起了一条条闪闪发光的银带子。社员们正忙着耕田、脱粒，风送来一阵阵社员们的嘹亮的歌声。
    好一片美好的景象！哪有一丝痕迹看得出，这里是曾经遭受过一场严重的干旱来？事实上，从8月初起，全县就有十多万亩水稻面临了脱浆断水的危机。从8月5日以后的三十多天中，整个降雨量只有八毫米多，“伏旱不为旱，秋旱断种粮”，这场旱，可正旱在个节骨眼上。可是怎样呢？眼前这一幅美好的画图，就是全县农村的一个缩影。这都是因为有了总路线、大跃进，都是因为有了人民公社！
    是的，谈到旱年收成，怎能不谈到三面红旗好！翻开一部《江宁志》，历史上这里就是个易旱易涝的地方。在那些黑暗的年月里，谁也数不清旱魔攫去了多少生命和财产，秦淮河水里有多少劳动人民的血泪。1942年，仅仅四十天不雨，全县庄稼就大半颗粒无收。今天，有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗，人，开始成为了大自然的主人；“人定胜天”这句话，更加富有了现实意义。去年，干旱从夏栽未完时开始，一家伙延续了一百多天，全县五万多个塘坝，90％干得个底子朝天。但是，凭仗着党的坚强领导，凭仗着人民公社的无比威力，全县人民塘干了车河水，河干了车江水，高山挡住去路，征服它！几十道、上百道的水车大阵一摆，逼使水流乖乖地翻山越岭而过。就这样，旱魔低了头，全县水稻比1958年还是增产。今年，当旱魔卷土重来时，社员们说：“嚯！这个老天爷又要来考考我们的人民公社，考考我们的革命干劲了！”好嘛，考就考考吧！经过四十多天的“测验”，揭晓了：人民公社，人民公社时代的人民胜利了，而那个老天爷呢？它又输了。
    一次又一次的雄辩的事实，反映了总路线、大跃进、人民公社愈来愈强大的无比威力。在人民公社人力物力统一的筹划与组织下，两年多来，全县新建了电灌站二十二座，大中型水库六十六座，涵闸二百五十六座，塘坝九千七百多处，另外还新添了抽水机械七千五百多马力。这些工程，使五十八万亩土地得到了抗旱排涝的保证。
    在抗旱斗争中，代表着人民公社时代精神的大协作、大支援，更加发出了凌霄冲汉的熠熠光辉。在人民公社的统一组织和互相帮助等价交换的原则下，各公社、各大队、各小队有无互通，患难相助，上游照顾下游，有水支持缺水，一处有难，八方支援。“困难留己，方便让人”的可歌事迹，一日里不知发生多少。去年，山峦环抱的谷里公社塘干坝竭，稻子眼看就要燃得起火。邻近的公社一知消息，立即人联人，车联车，历程三十里，翻山十余座，一个接一个地把长江江水盘到这个社里。在抗旱中，工业部门送来了机械、技工；商业部门送来了器材、日用品；食堂的饭担子一直送到田头；医生、保健员一步没离开生产前线……正是这一切，才把人的力量联成了一个无坚不摧的大整体，抗住了旱灾，赢得了胜利。
    强大的总路线、大跃进的威力！
    强大的人民公社的威力！
    依靠这个威力，我们什么事情都能办得好。
