    Greening the Roads Traveled by the Red Army During the Long March
    Guyuan Youth Enthusiastically Create "Long March Forest"

    (Our Dispatch) Since the spring of this year, the vast number of young people in the Guyuan Special District of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have launched a very meaningful tree planting and afforestation movement to create a "Long March Forest," greening the roads in the Liupan Mountain area that the Red Army traveled during the Long March.

    The "Long March Forest" creation activity was carried out under the leadership and specific organization of the Communist Youth League Guyuan Prefectural Committee and the Youth League organizations of various counties in Guyuan Special District. The purpose is to carry out revolutionary tradition education for the vast number of Youth League members and young people through this activity, to improve the ideological awareness of young people, to inherit and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of revolutionary predecessors, and to love our socialist motherland and a beautiful future more deeply.

    At the beginning of the "Long March Forest" creation activity, youth from all over the country held oath-taking meetings and activist meetings. Some League organizations also invited local revolutionary veterans who had participated in the Red Army to speak to the youth. More than 80,000 young people from the entire special district invested in this meaningful afforestation activity. They organized more than 1,100 afforestation shock teams and, around the "April 1st" Youth Afforestation Day, beat gongs and drums, climbed high mountains, and entered deep gullies. Along the hundreds of kilometers of roads the Red Army had traveled, they launched a large-scale afforestation activity. In Longde County, more than 1,500 young people from the Chengguan Commune planted more than 43,000 trees in just three days in the areas of Liupan Mountain that the Red Army had passed through. The Communist Youth League Guyuan County Committee also designated eight important camping sites of the Red Army, such as Qingshuizui, Baiyangcheng, and Panhe Village, as key afforestation areas, organizing a 10,000-strong army for greening. More than 700 young people from the Chuanyi Commune in Guyuan County created a "Long March Forest" for 20 kilometers in five days. In this county, more than 500 young people also created a "Red Army Long March Orchard" in Beihai, a suburb. The youth in Jingyuan County, which the Red Army did not pass through at the time, in order to express their wishes for creating a "Long March Forest," also supported the youth in Guyuan, Xiji, and Haiyuan with 800 saplings and 300 catties of tree seeds.

    Now that the autumn afforestation season is approaching, the League organizations in Guyuan Special District are preparing to further organize young people to carry out activities to create "Long March Forests" in conjunction with autumn afforestation. At present, the vast number of young people are also actively collecting tree seeds and fruit cores, and some places are also planning to establish nurseries to prepare for the continued creation of "Long March Forests" in the autumn. The Communist Youth League Guyuan County Committee recently held a meeting on creating "Long March Forests" in the Dagong Team of Shizi Commune below the main peak of Liupan Mountain. In addition to inspecting spring afforestation, specific arrangements were made for the areas where young people from various people's communes will create "Long March Forests" in sections this autumn. The county is preparing to mobilize 80,000 young people before and after November 1st to organize a "Long March Forest" creation expeditionary force to carry out a shock afforestation campaign in the autumn and prepare for afforestation in the spring of next year.

    绿化红军长征走过的道路
    固原青少年热情营造“长征林”
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区固原专区广大青少年从今年春季开始，开展了一次极有意义的营造“长征林”的植树造林运动，绿化当年红军长征时在六盘山地区走过的道路。
    营造“长征林”这一活动，是在共青团固原地委和固原专区各县团组织的领导和具体组织下进行的。目的是为了通过这一活动，向广大团员和青少年进行革命传统教育，以提高青少年的思想觉悟，继承和发扬革命前辈艰苦奋斗的精神，更加热爱我们的社会主义祖国和美好的未来。
    营造“长征林”的活动一开始，各地青少年都举行了誓师会、积极分子会，有的团组织还邀请当地参加过红军的革命老前辈给青少年讲了话。全专区有八万多青少年投入了这一有意义的造林活动。他们组织成一千一百多个造林突击队，在“四一”青少年造林日前后，敲锣打鼓，上高山、进深沟，沿着当年红军经过的长达数百公里的长途，展开了大规模的造林活动。隆德县城关公社一千五百多青少年只三天时间，在六盘山上红军经过的地方植树四万三千多株。共青团固原县委还把当年红军经过的重要宿营地青石嘴、白阳城、潘河村等八个地方，规划为重点造林区，组织万人大军进行绿化。固原县传易公社七百多青年，五天内就营造“长征林”二十公里。这个县有五百多名青少年，还在城郊北海营造了“红军长征果园”一处。当年红军没有经过的泾源县的青少年，为了表达他们对营造“长征林”的心意，还把树苗八百株、树籽三百斤，支援给固原、西吉、海原的青少年。
    现在，秋季造林季节快要到来，固原专区各地团组织准备结合秋季造林进一步组织青少年开展营造“长征林”的活动。目前，广大青少年也正在积极采集树种，搜集果核，有的地方还规划建立苗圃，为秋季继续营造“长征林”作准备。共青团固原县委最近还专门在六盘山主峰下面的什字公社大公队召开了营造“长征林”的会议，除检查春季造林外，对今年秋季各人民公社青少年营造“长征林”的地区分段又作了具体安排，全县准备在11月1日前后，动员八万名青少年，组织成营造“长征林”的远征军，突击秋季造林，并为明年春季造林作好准备工作。
