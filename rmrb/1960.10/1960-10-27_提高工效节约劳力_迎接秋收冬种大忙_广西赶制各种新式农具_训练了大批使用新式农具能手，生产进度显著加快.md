Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 26th: Guangxi is actively rushing to produce various new types of harvesting and planting farm tools to welcome the busy autumn harvest and winter planting season.

Preparing sufficient farm tools early and producing more new types of farm tools are of particular importance for doing a good job in the autumn harvest and winter planting. This year, Guangxi is vigorously promoting winter planting, and the winter planting area in various places will be greatly expanded compared to the past. This requires that the mature autumn harvest crops must be harvested quickly in order to free up the fields and allow the sowing of large areas of winter crops to catch up with the time and not miss the season. The autumn harvest is highly seasonal, and mature grain crops must be harvested quickly and in a timely manner to avoid losses from lodging and grain drop. Moreover, with sufficient farm tools, the labor force for manufacturing farm tools can be freed up to be invested in the autumn harvest and winter planting.

All localities have started early, organized forces, and launched a mass movement to manufacture and repair new types of autumn harvest and winter planting farm tools on a large scale. Yulin County started as early as the beginning of August. Beforehand, farm tool factories in the county and communes sent people to production teams to investigate and study, and made production plans based on what was lacking and how much was lacking, and arranged manufacturing and repair according to the technical equipment conditions of each farm tool factory. By the end of September, the county had manufactured more than 200,000 pieces of various harvesting and planting farm tools and repaired 46,000 pieces, basically ensuring the needs. Pingguo County has used a combination of professional factory manufacturing and mass rush repair to enable an average of eleven autumn harvest and winter planting tools per laborer. Yongning County has manufactured more than 10,000 harvesters, with an average of one harvester for every 30-plus mu of late rice fields.

As various autumn harvest and winter planting farm tools arrive at the forefront of production, various places are taking advantage of the busy season to organize the masses to learn how to use new farm tools. The Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture held a deep plowing plow technology training class in Pingnan County, attended by nearly 200 people including plowing experts and iron and woodworkers from various counties. Commune members in many counties such as Jingxi, Guixian, and Yongning are enthusiastically learning how to use harvesters. Ten communes in Jingxi County have trained the first batch of 488 harvester experts. After preparing sufficient autumn harvest and winter planting farm tools, Pingnan, Yulin, Pingguo, and other counties have each transferred thousands of farm tool factory workers to strengthen the technical force of farm tool repair stations in each production team.

In areas where the autumn harvest and winter planting season is earlier, production progress has been significantly accelerated due to the timely use of new farm tools. This year, the Yancha Commune of the Longlin Autonomous County used 600 harvesters for the autumn harvest, increasing harvesting efficiency by about one time compared to last year.

    提高工效节约劳力  迎接秋收冬种大忙
    广西赶制各种新式农具
    训练了大批使用新式农具能手，生产进度显著加快
    新华社南宁26日电  广西各地积极赶制各种收、种新式农具，迎接秋收冬种大忙。
    提早备足农具，多制新式农具，对做好秋收冬种具有特别重要的意义。今年广西大搞冬种，各地冬种面积都将比过去扩大很多。这样，就要求成熟的秋收作物必须收得快，才能腾出田地，使大面积的冬种作物的播种抢上时间，不误季节；秋收季节性强，成熟的粮食作物必须迅速适时地收回来，才可避免倒伏掉粒的损失；而且农具备足了，制造农具的劳动力就可腾出来投入秋收冬种。
    各地都是及早动手，组织力量，掀起大制大修秋收冬种新式农具的群众运动。玉林县早在8月初就动手。事前，县和公社的农具厂都派人到生产队调查研究，根据缺什么，缺多少，作出生产计划，按照各农具厂的技术设备条件安排制造和修配。到9月底，全县已经制成各项收种农具二十多万件，修配四万六千多件，基本保证了需要。平果县运用工厂专业制造和群众突击修造相结合的办法，已使平均每个劳动力有秋收冬种工具十一件。邕宁县已制成收割器一万多部，平均三十多亩晚稻田就有一部。
    随着各项秋收冬种农具的到达生产第一线，各地都趁大忙之前组织群众学习使用新式农具。自治区农业厅在平南县举办了深耕犁技术训练班，参加的有各县犁田能手及铁木工等近二百人，靖西、贵县、邕宁等许多县的公社社员们都在热情地学习使用收割器。靖西县十个公社共已培训第一批收割器能手四百八十八人。平南、玉林、平果等县在备足了秋收冬种农具之后，每县都抽调上千的农具厂职工，加强各生产队农具修配站的技术力量。
    秋收冬种季节较早的地区，由于及时用上了新农具，生产进度显著加快。隆林各族自治县岩茶公社今年秋收使用了六百部收割器，收割工效比去年提高约一倍。
