    Leaders such as Zhu De and Zhou Enlai Attend Banquet; Ambassador Li Yong-ho and Vice Premier Chen Yi Deliver Speeches

    Xinhua News Agency, October 25th – The Ambassador of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to China, Li Yong-ho, held a grand banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the great Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people.

    Party and state leaders Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and others were invited to attend the banquet.

    On this glorious day, the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was brightly lit and filled with joy. The friendship forged in blood by the Chinese and Korean people closely linked the hearts of the Chinese and Korean comrades attending the banquet. During the event, everyone repeatedly raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the common victory of the Chinese and Korean people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, to celebrate the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to wish that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people would be as eternal as the sun and moon, shining forever.

    Ambassador Li Yong-ho spoke at the banquet. He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the former Chinese People's Volunteers who participated in the war against U.S. imperialist aggression in Korea, and to the Chinese people. He warmly praised the Chinese People's Volunteers, who, since the day they joined the Korean War, had displayed unparalleled courage and collective heroism in countless fierce battles, and had thoroughly demonstrated the spirit of self-sacrifice for the victory of the war. He said that all the volunteer soldiers who participated in the Korean War fought as bravely as Huang Jiguang and Yang Gensi; they loved the Korean people as much as Luo Shengjiao, and cherished every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea as if they were their own. The blood shed by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers on the beautiful land of Korea and the heroic achievements they made will shine forever along with the beautiful mountains and rivers of our country, and with the Friendship Tower that stands majestically in the corner of Pyongyang's Mao Zedong Street; and they will be recited by our people’s descendants and spread for generations like beautiful legends.

    Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people are rapidly transforming their country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture through the great leap forward in socialist construction. He said that now, the Korean people are unanimously mobilized and are making preparations to successfully implement the magnificent seven-year plan for the people’s economy put forward by the Korean Workers’ Party, striving to turn their country into a developed socialist industrial country in the near future.

    Referring to the crimes of U.S. imperialism continuing to occupy the southern half of Korea and China's Taiwan, Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the Korean people will surely be able to force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops to get out of South Korea and peacefully reunify the motherland, and deeply believe that Taiwan will soon return to the embrace of the 650 million Chinese people. Ambassador Li Yong-ho concluded by saying that the Chinese and Korean people, united in the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union, will always stand firmly together on the common front against imperialist aggressors, defending peace in the Far East, and the socialist eastern outpost.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He said that today, we are attending the banquet held by Ambassador Comrade with great pleasure to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad. We express our highest respect to the heroic Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, and the government.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that October 25th is a glorious day for the Chinese and Korean people to jointly oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and defend peace in Asia and the world. Ten years ago, U.S. imperialism launched the largest aggressive war since World War II against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and at the same time occupied our territory of Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people launched a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. This struggle was not only related to the survival of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also to the safety of China and the peace of Asia and the world. In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homeland, on this day ten years ago, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, shouldering the glorious mission of the people of the motherland, bravely crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the fraternal Korean people against the American aggressors. The great victory of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War dealt a blow to the arrogant aggression of U.S. imperialism, exposed the essentially weak nature of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger, and greatly encouraged the confidence of the oppressed nations and people around the world in their struggle for liberation. It has made an immeasurable contribution to the noble cause of world peace and human progress. Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the common struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against U.S. imperialist aggression has brought about unprecedented development in the militant friendship between our two peoples. The interdependent and closely linked relationship and the fighting friendship cemented with blood between the Chinese and Korean people in the long-term struggle are a noble manifestation of proletarian internationalism. The Chinese people will spare no effort to strengthen the great unity of our two peoples in order to make greater contributions to the common cause of developing socialism, communism, opposing imperialism, and defending world peace.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi used many facts to illustrate that the Chinese and Korean people are loyal to the cause of world peace and have always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. However, U.S. imperialism stubbornly adheres to its policy of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism is still赖 (lai - depending on context can mean hanging around, lingering, unwilling to leave, or relying on) in South Korea and continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and constantly carries out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese and Korean people. U.S. imperialism not only persists in being hostile to the Chinese and Korean people, but also engages in frenzied arms expansion and war preparations on a global scale, plots to subvert and undermine socialist countries, blatantly interferes in and suppresses the national and democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and seriously threatens world peace. Recently, the evil activities of the United States at the 15th United Nations General Assembly are a major exposure of U.S. imperialism's war conspiracies and aggression plans. All of this powerfully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, but also the most ferocious enemy of the people all over the world. The Chinese and Korean people, the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people in the world must continue to heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and wage an unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the development of the situation over the past ten years has become increasingly favorable to the cause of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. Under the excellent situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind internationally, the domestic situations in our two countries also present a bright and splendid prospect. Our two peoples are engaging in the great cause of socialist construction with the heroic spirit of defeating U.S. imperialism. The Chollima Movement in Korea and the continuous Great Leap Forward in China have brought about rapid changes to the construction cause of our two peoples. Let us hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, further strengthen the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and strive to the end to promote the final victory of our common cause.

    Former Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Li Zhimin, delivered a speech at the banquet. He said that during the Chinese People's Volunteers' stay in Korea, the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the heroic Korean people gave us meticulous care and full support. Today, Ambassador Li Yong-ho is holding such a grand banquet to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We express our heartfelt gratitude. He raised his glass and proposed a toast to the health of the Korean people's respected leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung, to the health of other leading comrades of the Korean Party and state, to the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in building socialism and in all other aspects, and to the health of the leaders, officers, and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army.

    Also invited to attend the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council Bo Yibo and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang and Burhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, Zhang Zhizhong, and Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association Lao She and Wei Chuantong, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and Beijing leaders, as well as people from all walks of life in China.

    Also invited to attend the banquet were senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including General Tan Zheng, General Wang Shusheng, General Xiao Hua, General Gan Siqi, and General Chen Bojun. Former Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Li Zhimin, former combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Luo Diekai, the father of Volunteer soldier martyr Luo Shengjiao, were also invited to attend the banquet. Major General Zhang Ruihuan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, and other leaders of the ensemble, diplomatic officials of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, and Korean comrades in Beijing all attended the banquet. During the banquet, the Korean People's Army Ensemble performed many beautiful Korean folk songs and dances and Chinese songs.

    中朝人民的心紧紧联系在一起
    朝鲜驻华大使举行盛大宴会纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝十周年
    朱德周恩来等领导人出席了宴会李永镐大使陈毅副总理讲了话
    新华社25日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐今晚在北京饭店举行盛大宴会，纪念中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜人民伟大的祖国解放战争十周年。
    党和国家的领导人朱德、周恩来、彭真、陈毅、李富春等应邀出席了宴会。
    在这个光辉日子的夜晚，北京饭店宴会厅张灯结彩，喜气洋洋。中朝两国人民用鲜血结成的友谊，把出席宴会的中朝两国同志的心紧紧地联系在一起。席间，大家不断高举酒杯，热烈祝贺中朝两国人民反美斗争的共同胜利，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结，祝贺中朝两国人民的兄弟友谊恒如日月，永放光彩。
    李永镐大使在宴会上讲话。他首先向参加反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争的前中国人民志愿军官兵、向中国人民，表示衷心的感谢。他热烈称赞中国人民志愿军，自从参加朝鲜战争那天起，在无数次的激烈战斗中，发挥了无比的勇敢精神和集体英雄主义精神，并为了战争的胜利，彻底发挥了自我牺牲精神。他说，参加过朝鲜战争的所有志愿军勇士们，都像黄继光和杨根思一样无比英勇地进行了战斗；都像罗盛教烈士一样热爱朝鲜人民，像珍惜自己的山水草木一样珍惜朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木。中国人民志愿军勇士们在朝鲜锦绣江山洒下的鲜血，建立的英雄业绩，将同我们祖国美丽的山河一起，同巍然屹立在平壤毛泽东大街一角的友谊塔一起，永放光彩；并且将像美丽的传说一样，在我国人民的子孙当中传诵，流芳万世。
    李永镐大使说，兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明领导下，通过社会主义建设大跃进，正在迅速地把自己的国家转变成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和先进科学与文化的伟大的社会主义强国。他说，现在，朝鲜人民一致动员起来，正在做着准备工作，以便成功地执行朝鲜劳动党提出的宏伟的人民经济七年计划，争取在不久的将来，把自己的国家变成一个发达的社会主义工业国。
    李永镐大使在谈到美帝国主义继续霸占朝鲜南半部和中国台湾的罪行后说，朝鲜人民一定能够迫使美帝国主义侵略军队滚出南朝鲜，和平统一祖国，并且深信：不久的将来，台湾一定会回到六亿五千万中国人民的怀抱。李永镐大使最后说，团结在以伟大苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的朝中两国人民，在反对帝国主义侵略者、保卫远东和平和社会主义东方前哨的共同战线上，将永远坚定地站在一起。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话。他说，今天我们怀着十分愉快的心情参加大使同志为纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战十周年举行的宴会。我们向英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和政府表示崇高的敬意。
    陈毅副总理说，10月25日，是中朝两国人民共同反对美帝国主义侵略、捍卫亚洲和世界和平的光辉日子。十年前，美帝国主义向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了第二次世界大战以来规模最大的侵略战争，并且同时占领了我国的领土台湾。英雄的朝鲜人民，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，展开了可歌可颂的抗击美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争。这一场斗争，不仅关系到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的存亡，而且关系到中国的安危以及亚洲和世界的和平。为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，十年前的今天，中国人民的优秀儿女，肩负祖国人民的光荣使命，英勇地跨过鸭绿江，同兄弟的朝鲜人民一道，共同抗击了美国侵略者。朝鲜人民祖国解放战争的伟大胜利，打击了美帝国主义不可一世的侵略气焰，揭露了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎的本质，大大鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族和人民争取解放的斗争信心。对世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业作出了不可估量的贡献。陈毅副总理着重指出，中朝两国人民抗击美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争，使我们两国人民的战斗友谊得到了空前的发展。中朝两国人民在长期斗争中所形成的唇齿相依、休戚与共的关系和用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是无产阶级国际主义精神的崇高表现。中国人民将不遗余力地加强我们两国人民的伟大团结，以便对发展社会主义、共产主义、反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业作出更大的贡献。
    陈毅副总理用许多事实说明中朝两国人民忠实于世界和平事业，一贯坚持和平的外交政策。但是，美帝国主义却顽固地坚持侵略政策和战争政策，美帝国主义至今还赖在南朝鲜不走，继续霸占着我国的领土台湾，并且不断地向中朝两国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。美帝国主义不仅坚持同中朝人民为敌，而且在全世界范围内进行疯狂的扩军备战，阴谋颠复和破坏社会主义国家，露骨地干涉和镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族、民主运动，严重地威胁着世界和平。最近，美国在十五届联合国大会上所进行的罪恶活动，是美帝国主义这种战争阴谋和侵略计划的一次大暴露。所有这一切，有力地说明，美帝国主义不仅是中朝两国人民最凶恶的敌人，而且是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。中朝两国人民，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民，必须继续提高警惕，加强团结，同美帝国主义进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，十年来的形势发展愈来愈有利于和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业。在国际上东风压倒西风的大好形势下，我们中朝两国的国内形势也呈现着一片光辉灿烂的前景。我们两国人民正以打败美帝国主义的英雄气概，热情奋发地从事着伟大的社会主义建设事业。朝鲜的千里马运动和中国的持续大跃进为我们两国人民的建设事业带来了日新月异的变化。让我们高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的大旗，进一步加强中朝两国人民的战斗友谊，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，为促进我们共同事业的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
    前中国人民志愿军政治委员李志民上将在宴会上致词。他说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜期间，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、英勇的朝鲜人民给了我们无微不至的关怀和全力支援。今天李永镐大使又为中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年举行这样盛大宴会。我们表示衷心感谢。他举杯提议，为朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成同志的健康，为朝鲜党和国家的其他领导同志的健康，为朝鲜人民在建设社会主义和其他各方面所取得的光辉成就，为英雄的朝鲜人民军领导人和官兵的健康，干杯。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有国务院副总理薄一波、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅、张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中朝友好协会副会长老舍、魏传统，各民主党派、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，以及中国各方面的人士。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有谭政大将、王树声大将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、陈伯钧上将等中国人民解放军的高级将领。前中国人民志愿军政治委员李志民上将，前中国人民志愿军的战斗英雄们，志愿军烈士罗盛教的父亲罗迭开，也应邀出席了宴会。朝鲜人民军协奏团团长张瑞焕少将和协奏团其他负责人，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆外交官员，以及在北京的朝鲜同志，都出席了宴会。宴会进行中，朝鲜人民军协奏团演出了许多优美的朝鲜民间歌舞和中国歌曲。
