    Hefei, October 29th (This Newspaper) – The leading comrades of the converter steelmaking workshop of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Agency Steel Plant, through in-depth investigation and research into all production aspects, identified key production issues and launched a vigorous technical innovation campaign, promoting a substantial increase in steel production. The plant's average daily output in September increased by 75% compared to August, and the average daily output in the first half of October increased by another 45.65% compared to the same period in September. The qualified ingot rate was above 96%, and the pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 29.55% compared to the past, making it a red banner for comprehensive leap forward in quality, high yield, and low consumption in the ongoing inter-plant competition among steel plants in the province.

    Where exactly is the key to hindering steel production increase?

    In the early stage of the increase production and practice economy movement, the steel output of this workshop did not increase significantly. Workers and cadres were all diligently searching for key problems in production and reported them to Zhou Aocheng, the deputy secretary of the plant party committee who was assigned to the workshop, and the workshop's leading comrades. Some people said that the quality of the converter furnace lining bricks was not good, and the furnace cap was quickly eroded and damaged by molten iron, requiring frequent repairs, which affected production. Some people said that the furnace bricks for the pig iron furnace could not be supplied in time, and the time for the converter to wait for molten iron was too long. Some people said that the furnace cap was damaged quickly because too much molten iron was loaded…

    It's not that the supply of furnace bricks is not timely, nor is it that the supply of molten iron cannot keep up.

    These phenomena all existed, but were they the key issues preventing the increase in output? Zhou Aocheng and the workshop's leading comrades conducted a series of investigations separately. They personally inspected the quality of the bricks, observed the workers' operations, and held meetings to study the matter. The results proved that the production and quality of the bricks had greatly improved compared to the past and could basically meet the needs. The next day, they went to the pig iron furnace to find the reason. The production situation of the pig iron furnace proved that the factor affecting steel output was not that the pig iron furnace could not supply molten iron to the converter. On the third day, from 2:00 PM to 2:00 AM, they stayed by the converter and saw that the steelmaking and ingot casting workers of the small night shift and the big night shift were all vigorous and energetic, skimming slag, charging materials, and casting ingots under high temperatures…. Everyone was striving to be the first in production. But the results of the small night shift that day were: nine furnaces of steel were smelted, using 24 tons of molten iron, but only 17 tons of steel were produced. The converter had a large amount of splashing, a lot of molten iron was lost, and the furnace cap eroded quickly, which affected the increase in output. Later, it was found that the big night shift also had the same situation. After careful study, the fundamental reason for this situation was that the converter workers wanted to produce more steel, so they loaded too much molten iron. But why load too much molten iron? It turned out that the converter furnace type was designed unreasonably, pursuing furnace life alone, and the furnace lining was made too thick, reducing the volume. A newly built converter could only load a little over one ton of molten iron at the beginning of smelting, and only three tons of molten iron could be loaded after the furnace lining became thinner later, and the average output of each furnace of steel was 2.2 tons. A three-ton converter actually only played the role of a two-ton converter. The workers wanted to produce more steel, so they had to overload.

    The problem lies here: a three-ton converter only plays the role of two tons.

    Zhou Aocheng and other leading comrades of the workshop seized this problem and immediately conducted research with workshop cadres, technicians, and workers. They inspected the converter furnace type design and production records, referred to the furnace type design data from the Shanghai Central Experimental Factory and other materials related to furnace type design, and consulted engineers from the Metallurgical Department. All of them indicated that the converter furnace lining was too thick. To produce more steel and make the three-ton converter play its full role, the furnace type design must be reformed.

    Can the furnace lining be thinner and the volume be expanded?

    They convened a meeting of grassroots cadres and worker representatives from all sections of the workshop to study this issue. Most people agreed to reform the furnace type design, and a few people also raised concerns that after reforming the design, the furnace life would be reduced because the furnace lining became thinner. Zhou Aocheng and the workshop's leading cadres believed that this was a technical problem and must be tested. They should first conduct a trial furnace experiment.

    The key to increasing production has finally been found.

    That afternoon, Zhou Aocheng and the workshop's leading cadres, technicians, and workers gathered by the furnace. Based on the furnace lining erosion situation, they carefully calculated and studied the new furnace type, reducing the furnace lining from the original 550 millimeters thick to 360 millimeters thin, expanding the volume by more than 50%, and immediately built a furnace for testing. The results of the trial furnace smelting were: 36 furnaces were smelted, producing 112 tons of steel. The steelmaking workers were all beaming with joy and spread the word, saying: "This is the key to increasing production. In the past, the highest furnace life was 52 furnaces, producing only 72 tons of steel, and generally 30 or so furnaces, the steel output was even less. Now, one furnace produces 112 tons of steel after smelting 36 furnaces." They proactively proposed to conscientiously abide by the operating procedures, strictly control the molten iron charging temperature and molten iron charging amount, implement the operating method of frequent shaking and less movement and top blowing as the main method, eliminate post-blowing, extend furnace life, and produce more high-quality steel. The brickmaking workers said: "In the past, more than 900 bricks were needed to build a furnace. Now, after the thickness is reduced, only more than 600 bricks are needed." They were determined to use the time saved by making one-third fewer bricks to improve quality, and stipulated that the number of times a brick was pressed by the brick pressing machine should be increased from the original five to six times to more than ten times. The results of the trial furnace smelting proved that the reformed furnace type did not reduce the furnace life, which dispelled people's concerns.

    Now, the new furnace type has become increasingly perfect, the workers operate carefully, and the quality and quantity of steel in the entire workshop are continuously improving, and the converter furnace life has also reached 42 furnaces. Due to the reform of the furnace type, the output has more than doubled compared to the past. In the previous period, due to technical innovation, the number of workers in the entire workshop has been reduced from 559 to 447, and now the output has doubled, but they are still more than capable of handling it.

    情况摸得透　关键抓得准　问题解决快
    安徽省委机关钢铁厂转炉车间日产水平猛增45％，铁耗下降29％以上
    本报合肥29日电　中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂转炉炼钢车间的领导同志，深入各个生产环节，进行细致的调查研究，找出了生产关键问题，大闹技术革新，促进钢产量大幅度增长。这个厂9月份的平均日产水平比8月份提高了75％，10月前半月的平均日产水平又比9月同期提高45.65％，钢锭合格率在96％以上，每吨钢的生铁消耗比过去降低29.55％，成为目前全省炼钢厂厂际竞赛中优质、高产、低耗全面跃进的一面红旗。
    阻碍钢产量提高的关键究竟在哪里？
    增产节约运动初期，这个车间钢产量并没有显著增加。工人和干部都用心寻找生产中的关键问题，纷纷向下放车间的厂党委副书记周敖成和车间的领导同志反映；有人说，转炉炉衬砖质量不好，炉帽被铁水冲刷侵蚀损坏快，需要经常补炉，影响产量；有人说化铁炉的炉砖不能及时供应，转炉等铁水的时间过长；有人说炉帽损坏快，是由于铁水装得过多……。
    不是炉砖供应不及时也不是铁水供应不上
    这些现象都存在，但究竟是不是产量提不高的关键问题？周敖成和车间的领导干部分头进行了一系列的调查工作。他们亲自检查了砖的质量，观察工人操作情况，并召开会议研究。结果证明：砖的产量和质量比过去有了很大提高，基本上是可以满足需要的。第二天他们又到化铁炉旁找原因。化铁炉的生产情况证明，影响钢产量的也不是化铁炉供应不上转炉铁水。第三天下午两点到深夜两点，他们一直待在转炉旁，看到小夜班、大夜班的炼钢、浇钢工人个个生龙活虎，在高温下扒渣、上料、浇钢……，生产中人人争先恐后。但这天小夜班的成绩却是：炼九炉钢，用了二十四吨铁水，只出了十七吨钢。转炉喷溅量大、铁水损耗多、炉帽侵蚀快，这样就影响了产量的提高。后来发现大夜班也出现同样情况。经过仔细研究，造成这种情况的根本原因是转炉工人想多出钢，把铁水装的过多而引起的。但为什么要过装铁水？原来转炉炉型设计不合理，单纯追求炉龄，把炉衬加得过厚，缩小了容积。一个新砌好的转炉，在吹炼初期只能装一吨多铁水，后期炉衬变薄以后才装到三吨多铁水，每炉钢的平均产量为二点二吨。三吨转炉实际只起两吨转炉的作用。工人们想多产钢，只好过装。
    问题就在这里：三吨转炉只起两吨的作用
    周敖成和车间其他领导同志抓住了这个问题，便立即和车间干部、技术员、工人进行研究，他们检查了转炉炉型设计和生产记录，参考上海中心试验厂炉型设计资料和其他有关炉型设计的材料，又请教了冶金厅的工程师等，都说明了转炉炉衬过厚。要多产钢，使三吨转炉充分发挥作用，就必须改革炉型设计。
    炉衬能不能薄一些，容积能不能扩大？
    他们召开了全车间各工段的基层干部和工人代表会议，来研究这个问题，大部分的人都同意改革炉型设计，少数人也提出怕改革设计后，因为炉衬变薄了会降低炉龄。周敖成和车间领导干部认为这是技术问题，必须通过试验，先搞个试验炉来看看。
    增产的关键终于找到了
    当天下午周敖成和车间领导干部、技术员、工人会师炉旁，根据炉衬侵蚀情况，精密计算研究新炉型，把炉衬由原来五百五十毫米厚减到三百六十毫米薄，扩大容积50％以上，并立即砌炉试验。试验炉吹炼的结果是：吹了三十六炉，出了一百一十二吨钢。炼钢工人个个喜笑颜开，争相传颂，他们说：“这才是找到了增产的关键，过去一个炉子最高炉龄五十二炉，只出了七十二吨钢，一般三十多炉，钢产量更少；现在一个炉子吹三十六炉，就出一百一十二吨钢。”他们主动提出要认真遵守操作规程，严格控制铁水装入温度和铁水装入量，实行勤摇少动面吹为主的操作方法，消灭后吹，延长炉龄，增产更多的优质钢。制砖工人说：“过去砌一个炉子要九百多块砖，现在改薄以后只要六百多块。”他们决心把少做三分之一砖的时间用在提高质量上，并规定压砖机压一块砖的次数要由原来的五至六次提高到十次以上，试验炉吹炼的结果证明，改革后的炉型并没有降低炉龄，它解除了人们的顾虑。
    现在，新的炉型已日臻完善，工人们精心操作，全车间钢的产量质量不断提高，转炉炉龄也达到了四十二炉。由于改革炉型使产量比过去猛增一倍。前一时期因为技术革新，全车间工人已由五百五十九名减少到四百四十七名，现在产量增加一倍后，仍然应付裕如。（附图片）
    鞍钢各级领导干部采用扎扎实实的领导方法，深入生产过程，一个一个解决问题，推动了生产持续跃进。这是东鞍山铁矿党委副书记胡继尧（中）下到烧结车间后，和群众一起解决重大关键，消除设备隐患　　　　　　本报记者　白林材摄
