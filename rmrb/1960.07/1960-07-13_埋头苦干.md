　　Bury Yourself in Hard Work
　　Liang Ruhai
　　The deeds of the Iron Girls Shock Brigade of Xiaoyuzhuang, Tangshan, are both moving and inspiring. In those Iron Girls, people see the spirit of burying oneself in hard work in our heroic era, and see the face of new people who have established lofty ambitions and are also down-to-earth.

　　Burying oneself in hard work is a characteristic of our great nation. Since ancient times, those pioneers who cut through thorns and briars, those pragmatic people who diligently seek the welfare of the masses, those who do not seek fame or engage in exaggeration but seek practical results, have always been praised by the public. In the long old society, the system of exploitation of man by man fettered the development of this spirit, and people could not get rid of the shackles of private ownership. Even if people buried themselves in hard work, they often achieved nothing. How should the historical figure of Zhuge Liang be evaluated? Historians will make a fair judgment. But his spirit of "devoting himself to the cause until his death" has been praised by people for more than a thousand years.

　　The Chinese proletariat and its vanguard have inherited and carried forward this fine tradition, elevating it in the crucible of revolution, becoming a spiritual force that encourages millions of people to endure hardship and overcome difficulties. Thus, we see that in the terrifying years when "killing people is like mowing grass without a sound," a small armed force raised the red flag of struggle, and a kitchen knife could start a revolution; in the face of enemies with dozens or hundreds of times superior strength, they still stood firm at their fighting posts with rifles and grenades, and finally became stronger and stronger, and finally defeated the enemy's eight million troops; three poor peasant households adhered to the direction of socialism, and the "poor stick" cooperative with three and a half donkey legs did not flinch and became more and more energetic; a pair of pliers and an old machine tool could start a factory and engage in technological revolution; a teacher could open a school in the mountains and sow the seeds of cultural revolution... All of this is the most beautiful and best picture drawn on our poor and blank land by the heroic sons and daughters educated by the Party, with the spirit of burying themselves in hard work.

　　The spirit of burying oneself in hard work is immortal.

　　Our cause is a magnificent building towering into the clouds, a broad road leading to the paradise on earth, and it is completely different from the "cause" that the ancients tirelessly sought. However, as the saying goes, a tall building rises from the ground. If it is not built brick by brick, where does the building come from? If you don't take solid steps, how can you finish the broad road?

　　Therefore, today, when the revolution has been victorious, and today, when the Great Leap Forward has brought us brilliant achievements, we must still carry forward the spirit of burying ourselves in hard work. Work in a down-to-earth manner, work bit by bit, work conscientiously, and make our foundation more solid, more consolidated, and more indestructible.

　　Therefore, in this era of heroic emergence, we must still dedicate our most enthusiastic praise to the people in the "poor stick" cooperative, to the heroes who "phoenixes come out of chicken coops," and to the Iron Girls Shock Brigade who work hard and practically.

　　埋头苦干
　　梁汝怀
    唐山小于庄铁姑娘突击队的事迹，使人感动，也使人振奋。在那几位铁姑娘身上，人们看到了我们英雄时代的埋头苦干的精神，看到了树立了壮志雄心而又踏踏实实的新人的面貌。
    埋头苦干，是我们这伟大的民族的性格特征。从古以来，那些披荆斩棘、胼手胝足的先驱者，那些勤勤恳恳为群众谋福利的实干家，那些不慕虚名、不尚浮夸、但求实效的人们，从来都是为大众所称道的。在漫长的旧社会里，人剥削人的制度桎梏了这种精神的发挥，人们怎么也摆脱不了私有观念的羁缚。纵使人们怎么埋头苦干，也常常一事无成。诸葛亮这个人物，在历史上究竟如何估价，历史学家会作出公正的判断。但他的那种“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”的精神，一千多年来始终为人们所称颂。
    中国的无产阶级和它的先锋队，继承和发扬了这个优良的传统，使它在革命的熔炉里得到升华，成为鼓舞千万人不辞艰苦、不畏困难的精神力量。于是，我们看到，在“杀人如草不闻声”的恐怖年代，一支小小的武装就竖起了斗争的红旗，一把菜刀就可以闹革命；在数十倍、数百倍优势的敌人面前，用步枪手榴弹也仍然坚守战斗岗位，终于越战越强，最后打垮了敌人的八百万兵马；三户贫农，坚持了社会主义的方向，三条半驴腿的“穷棒子”社，毫不气馁，越干越有精神；一把老虎钳、一台旧机床，都可以办起工厂，搞技术革命；一个老师，就能在山区开起学校，撒下文化革命种籽……这一切，都是党教育出来的英雄儿女，用埋头苦干的精神，在我们这一穷二白的土地上画出来的最美最好的图画。
    埋头苦干的精神是不朽的。
    我们的事业是矗立云霄的辉煌的大厦，是通向人间极乐世界的阳关大道，和古人们的孜孜不倦以求的“事业”，完全是两回事。但是，俗话说得好：万丈高楼平地起。如果不是一砖一瓦砌起来，大厦从何而来？如果不脚踏实地开步走，阳关大道又怎么能走完？
    所以，在革命胜利了的今天，在大跃进为我们带来辉煌成就的今天，我们仍然要发扬埋头苦干的精神。踏踏实实地干，点点滴滴地干，认认真真地干，把我们的基础打得更加扎实、更加巩固，更加坚不可摧。
    所以，在英雄辈出的时代，我们仍然要把最热情的颂歌，献给“穷棒子”社里的人物，献给“鸡窝里出凤凰”的英雄，献给苦干、实干的铁姑娘突击队。
