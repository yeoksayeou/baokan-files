　　Heroes Battle the "Hundred Li Wind"
　　By our reporter Lü Hongxiang
　　Majestically and unrestrainedly, the wind sweeps,
　　Before the cliff, pine and cypress trees fall;
　　Sowing earth, dust flies, sand splatters,
　　Overturning rivers and churning seas, waves roar.
        -- Ancient depiction of the Gobi wind

    The laying of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has entered the "Hundred Li Wind Zone" in the eastern part of the Turpan Basin. It is advancing towards Shanshan Station, 305 kilometers from Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

    As soon as you arrive at the track-laying site, the tense and fiery atmosphere of battle immediately attracts you. In the vast desert, the wild wind howls like rivers overturning and seas churning. The track-laying machine advances slowly, using its trunk-like boom to send track sections to the ground; locomotives loaded with track sections follow closely behind the track-laying machine. Before the first carload of track sections is laid, another car arrives. On the roadbed, sand waves roll along the ground, exploding and sinking into the sand curtain. The bolt workers, submerged in the sand curtain, bend over to operate, enduring the scorching sand particles that beat down on their heads and faces. Sometimes, a bolt is just placed when it is instantly buried by sand and gravel. The wind makes it difficult to communicate verbally, so everyone uses gestures to communicate with each other.

    Young worker Jin Baocang kept waving his fist and shouting, "Add oil, faster...", urging the track-laying machine to advance. This bolt worker, who has fought on the track-laying front for many years, was recently so anxious that he cried several times because his unfamiliarity with the technique of tightening bolts could not keep up with the track-laying requirements, affecting the track-laying speed. But since then, he has become close friends with the wrench, and the wrench is always with him, whether he is eating or resting; whenever he has time, he gestures, ponders, and looks for tricks to improve the speed of tightening bolts. Even in bed at night, he draws the angle between the wrench and the rail. Now, he holds the wrench and rolls up his sleeves. As soon as the track section lands, he assumes a horse-riding climbing posture, and the wrench rotates like a windmill. In a few seconds, he completes all the work of installing the fishplate and tightening the bolts. The impatient young man was just about to straighten up and urge the track-laying machine to move forward when a sudden gust of wind knocked him to the ground. But he ignored it, rolled over, got up, and without bothering to wipe the mud and sand off his face, chased after the track-laying machine, shouting slogans, and advancing with it.

    Currently, the track-laying team has reached the center of the "Hundred Li Wind Zone". This is a gap in the Tianshan Mountains, where the north wind blocked by the Bogda Mountains enters directly through the Qijiaojing Gorge. Large and small wind gullies form the historically famous "Hundred Li Wind Zone". The strong Gobi wind sweeps away, and nothing like sedge or red willow can be seen. Even the road signs recently erected next to the roadbed have been uprooted, and those that remain have been blown and beaten by the wind and sand so that no words can be seen.

    According to legend, when the famous Han Dynasty general Zhang Qian passed through here on his mission to the Western Regions, he encountered the Gobi "Wind Demon", and most of the supplies and personnel were blown away. Later, he sacrificed to the Wind God Temple, and only then did he escape the wind disaster. Since then, people who have passed through here in successive generations have only sighed in the face of this great wind: "Pizhan (Shanshan) region is a country of wind disasters and ghostly difficulties." Although a Wind God Temple still remains in this area, the heroes of construction only believe in the power of people and do not worship the Wind God.

    In the "Hundred Li Wind Zone", the wind force is many times stronger on bridgeheads and in gullies than on flat ground, so laying tracks on bridgeheads is even more frightening. At the bridgehead construction site, the fierce wind roars, and the sand and gravel on the upper layer of the Gobi have long been swept away. The strong wind uncovers the hard shell of the Gobi, made of crushed stones. Fist-sized stones rotate, whir, and fall like cannonballs onto the piers and onto the roadbed. The track-laying machine, weighing dozens of tons and standing on the bridgehead, is also swaying slightly. Although the bridge is not long, it is really difficult to pass. Workers on the roadbed are blown down by the wind and then get up, get up and then are blown down again; later they tightened their clothes and pants, took off their hats, and joined hands to form a "human chain", taking heavy steps, and shouting as they advanced against the wind. However, after advancing only a few steps, a gust of wind struck, and the "chain" was broken, cut into many sections. "Lie down! Advance!", at the command, the workers, like soldiers rushing into a fierce hand-to-hand battle, crawled, rolled, and fought on the bridge. Suddenly, a "human dragon" appeared on the bridge.

    The wind was roaring. After a fierce battle, when the track-laying machine safely crossed the bridge, the heroes looked back at the neat tracks lying on the bridge as they surveyed the top of the bridge, and smiles appeared on their faces. But the squad leader Chen Xiaoer was still not at ease. He began to stare at the bridgehead, and then he simply climbed along the bridge, checking each spike and each bolt, and then climbed back from the opposite bank of the bridge, shouting to the comrades who had already gone far away: "The track-laying quality of the bridge fully meets the requirements, comrades, continue to advance...."

    The workers said well: "What can the wind do to us"? According to the "conventional" track-laying rules in the past, track-laying had to be stopped immediately as soon as the wind speed exceeded level eight; but since entering the wind zone, the wind speed has often remained above levels nine and ten, and they have never stopped track-laying once due to the strong wind! As the track-laying project extends westward, the heroes are planning to divert water, plant trees, and reclaim land here, turning this "Hundred Li Wind Zone" into a fertile "Hundred Li Oasis". In order to highlight the characteristics of the area, the workers initially named the two stations west of Shisanjianfang as "Dafeng" (Big Wind) and "Feisha" (Flying Sand) stations. Now, they feel that these daunting station names are not in line with the beautiful vision of this area, so they renamed them "Dabu" (Big Step) and "Feiyue" (Leap) stations. Let the heroes leap forward like the names of the stations! (Attached picture)

### 英雄大战“百里风”

　　英雄大战“百里风”
　　本报记者　　吕鸿祥
　　巍巍荡荡飒飘飘，
　　崖前松柏棵棵倒；
　　播土扬尘沙迸迸，
　　翻江搅海浪涛涛。
        ——古人戈壁风写照
    兰新铁路铺轨已进入吐鲁番盆地东部的“百里风区”。正向距新疆维吾尔自治区首府——乌鲁木齐三百零五公里的鄯善车站前进。
    一到铺轨工地，那紧张而炽热的战斗气氛，立刻就把人吸引住了。翰海茫茫，狂风翻江捣海似地呼啸着，铺轨机一边缓缓前进，一边用它那象鼻子似的长形吊杆把一副副轨节送向地面；满载轨节的机车，紧随在铺轨机的后头，不等第一车轨节铺完，又有一车送上来。路基上，沙浪贴地翻滚着，爆响着，沉没在沙幕中的螺拴工们弯着腰操作，忍受着灼热的沙粒没头没脸的扑打。有时一个螺拴刚刚放下，转瞬间就被沙砾埋没了。狂风使人们传递语言都发生了困难，大家互相联系，只好用手势来代替。
    青年工人金保仓不住的挥动着拳头叫喊着：“加油，快……”，催促着铺轨机前进。这个曾在铺轨前线转战多年的螺拴工，不久前还因为技术不熟练，上螺拴跟不上铺轨要求，影响铺轨速度，急得哭了好几次。但从那时起，他却同螺丝搬子结成了密友，不论吃饭、休息，螺丝搬子总是不离身；一有空就比划着，琢磨着，寻找提高螺丝拴操作速度的窍门。甚至夜里睡在被窝里，也在划着螺丝搬子同钢轨的角度，眼下，他手提螺搬，卷着袖子。轨节刚刚落地，一个骑马登山势，只见螺搬风轮似的旋转着，几秒钟，就把安夹板、上螺丝等全部工作完成。急性的小伙子，刚刚又要直起腰来，催促着铺轨机前进，猛的一个风浪，把他摔在地上，可是他毫不理睬，一个滚翻起身来，满脸的泥沙也顾不得擦，又追上去，喊着号子，跟着铺轨机前进了。
    目前，铺轨队到达的地方，正是“百里风区”的中心。这里是天山缺口，被博格达山阻挡的北风，顺七角井峡谷长驱直入，大大小小的风壑，形成历史上著名的“百里风区”。强劲的戈壁风扫来，什么蓑草、红柳等都看不见了。就连那路基旁不久前才设下的指路牌，有的已被连根拔起，留下的也早被风沙吹打得看不出一点字样了。
    相传汉朝名将张骞出使西域路过这里的时候，遭遇戈壁“风妖”，大部分辎重人马被风卷走，后来祀了风神庙，才幸免风祸。此后历代经过这里的人，在这巨风面前，也只能感叹：“辟展（鄯善）地域，风灾鬼难之国也。”如今这一带虽还留有风神庙在，但筑路英雄们却只相信人的力量，而不去拜风神了。
    在“百里风区”，碰上桥头，沟壑，风力要比平地猛烈许多倍，因此桥头铺轨就更令人心悸。桥头工地上，烈风咆哮，戈壁上层的沙子、石砾早被刮扫净光，劲风揭开碎石砌成的戈壁硬壳，拳头大的石块旋转着，嗡响着，炮弹般的落向桥墩，射上路基。矗立在桥头上几十吨重的铺轨机，也在微微摇摆。桥虽说不长，但着实不易通过。工人在路基上，被大风推倒又爬起来，爬起来又被推倒；后来就扎紧衣裤、脱去帽子，手拉手结成一条“人的链条”，迈着沉重的步子，?喝着顶风前进。可是，没有前进几步，一个风浪打来，“链条”被打断了，切成许多截。“卧倒！前进！”，一声号令下，工人们像冲入激烈的肉搏战的战士一样，在桥顶上爬着、滚着、搏斗着，桥上顿时出现一条“人的长龙”。
    风在怒吼，经过一场激烈的搏斗，当铺轨机安全地渡过大桥，英雄们在桥头回首巡视着桥顶躺着整齐的轨道时，脸都浮现出胜利的微笑。可是小队长陈小二还是不放心，开始在桥头目不转睛的打量，后来就索性顺桥爬去，检查着每个道钉，每个螺拴，然后又从桥对岸爬回来，向着已经走远的伙伴们呼喊着：“大桥铺轨质量完全合乎要求，同志们，继续前进……。”
    工人同志们说得好：“大风能把我们怎么样呢”？按照从前铺轨的“常规”，风速只要超过八级，就得马上停止铺轨；但从进入风区以来，风速经常保持在九、十级以上，他们却没有一次因风大而停止过铺轨！随着铺轨工程向西延进，英雄们正计划着在这里引水、栽树、开荒造田，把这个“百里风区”变成富饶的“百里绿洲”。为了标明地区特点，起初，工人们把十三间房以西的两个车站，命名为“大风”、“飞沙”车站。现在，他们觉得这令人生畏的车站名字，与这地区美好的远景不相称，就把它改名叫“大步”、“飞跃”车站了。让英雄们像车站的名字一样，大踏步的飞跃前进吧！（附图片）
