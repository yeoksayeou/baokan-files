Organize Labor Force and Concentrate on Shock Tactics
Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture Intensifies Corn Field Management

(Our dispatch) The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, seized the opportunity of several consecutive sunny days during the rainy season to concentrate its main force and launch a shock campaign to weed corn. In three days, 850,000 mu of corn were hoed throughout the prefecture. Together with the previously hoed areas, the first round of hoeing for the prefecture's 1.2 million mu of corn has basically been completed.

Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture planted 1.2 million mu of corn this year. To ensure a large-scale increase in corn production, the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee formulated eight measures for field management during planting. On June 12, according to weather forecasts, there would be several consecutive sunny days soon. The Prefectural Committee seized this opportunity and held an emergency telephone conference to mobilize a three-day shock campaign to hoe the first round of corn. This call was warmly supported by the masses. Various people's communes actively assigned tasks to the masses and mobilized them for the shock campaign. Luxi County proposed that seizing the opportunity is victory, and seizing the opportunity is grain. On June 13, the whole prefecture mobilized 430,000 people to hoe corn, with a daily progress of 380,000 mu.

During the upsurge of the shock campaign to hoe corn, cadres at all levels went deep into the front line, adhered to the "three togethers," and participated in hoeing. The labor force mobilized from various agencies and units at the state and county levels alone reached more than 20,000 people, which boosted the enthusiasm of the masses.

Eighty-three cadres above the management area level in the Guju People's Commune of Chuxiong County participated in hoeing corn in various production teams. The deputy secretary of the commune party committee helped the first team of the Xuying management area improve labor organization by adopting the method of one person hoeing one furrow, changing short hoe handles to long hoe handles, and changing narrow hoes to wide hoes, which improved work efficiency. The whole team of thirty-eight people hoed fifty mu in one day and became a model team. The Doushan management area of Longchuan Commune launched a five "same" competition campaign. The five "same" are: 1. Everyone is enthusiastically involved in hoeing. 2. Each team organizes a field comprehensive management team. 3. The hoe blade is wide and long, and the hoe handle is suitable and easy to use. 4. Deep digging and turning, thinning and setting seedlings, two plants per hole, removing all weeds, not digging off a single seedling, and not knocking down a single seedling. 5. Work efficiency generally reaches more than one mu. Since the launch of the competition, the daily progress of hoeing has rapidly increased to 360 mu, accounting for 40% of the area to be hoed.

During the upsurge of the shock campaign to hoe corn, the people's communes generally promoted the labor organization form of comprehensive work groups, implementing the four fixed aspects of land, labor, leadership, and work points. They established a responsibility system of continuous contracting, task assignment to groups, measures to fields, and quotas to individuals, which strengthened the sense of responsibility of the commune members.

    组织劳力　集中突击
    楚雄自治州加紧玉米中耕
    本报讯　云南楚雄彝族自治州抓住雨季中连续几天的晴天，集中主要兵力，开展突击锄玉米运动。三天时间，全州薅锄玉米八十五万亩，连原来薅锄过的加在一起，全州一百二十万亩玉米基本上结束了第一道薅锄。
    楚雄自治州今年种植玉米一百二十万亩。为了确保大面积玉米增产，中共楚雄地委在栽种的时候就制定了中耕田间管理的八项措施。6月12日，据气象预报，最近有连续几天晴天，地委抓紧这一时机，开了紧急电话会议，动员突击三天，薅锄完头道玉米。这一号召发出后，受到广大群众的热烈拥护，各人民公社积极把任务交给群众，发动群众突击。禄丰县提出，抢住时机就是胜利，抢住时机就是粮食。全州各公社在13日这一天，就出动了四十三万人锄玉米，日进度达三十八万亩。
    在突击薅锄玉米的热潮中，各级干部深入第一线，坚持“三同”，参加薅锄。单是州、县级各机关单位出动的劳动力就达二万多人，鼓舞了群众的干劲。
    楚雄县古苴公社管理区以上的八十三名干部，都分别到各生产队参加锄玉米。公社党委副书记帮助徐营管理区第一队改进劳动组织，采取一人锄一墒，改短锄把为长锄把，改窄锄为宽锄，提高了工效，全队三十八个人，一天锄了五十亩，成为标兵队。龙川公社斗山管理区开展五个“一个样”竞赛运动，五个一个样就是：一、人人干劲冲天投入薅锄。二、各队组织田间综合管理小组。三、锄板又宽又长，锄把合适顺手。四、深挖翻好，间苗定苗，每塘两棵，拔光夹窝草，不挖断一苗，不压倒一苗。五、工效普遍达到一亩以上。自开展竞赛后，薅锄日进度迅速提高到三百六十亩，占应薅面积的40％。
    在突击薅锄玉米的热潮中，各人民公社普遍推行了综合性作业组的劳动组织形式，实行土地、劳力、领导、工分四固定，建立连续承包、任务到组、措施到田、定额到人的责任制，加强了社员的责任心。
