　　·The New Cook·
　　The workers of the smelting workshop of the Hongzhuan Steel Plant in Wanxian, Sichuan, operate in front of raging furnaces all day long, but they often couldn't get boiled water in this hot weather. This matter was brought to the attention of Yan Xiwu, the deputy secretary of the Party branch.

　　One day, the cooks of the iron plant's canteen were busy cutting vegetables and cooking when a new cook arrived. As soon as he arrived, he immediately helped everyone cut vegetables and wash dishes. He liked to do any work, and he went wherever it was busy, working very efficiently. However, he also had differences from other cooks. He not only buried himself in work but also liked to watch how other cooks worked. More prominent was that he talked a lot, always asking the cooks beside him this and that while working:

　　"Why is it that the smelting workshop often can't get boiled water?"

　　"Too much work, not enough time, no time to boil water!"...

　　After following the shift for a day, the new cook, the deputy secretary of the Party branch Yan Xiwu, found the canteen staff to study together, rationally arranged the cooks' working hours, and improved the organization of labor. Soon, the smelting workshop had boiled water to drink, and the quality of the canteen's meals also improved compared to the past. The production workers were satisfied, and the cooks were also beaming with joy.

　　·新来的炊事员·
    四川万县红专炼钢厂冶炼车间的工人们，成天在熊熊的炉火面前操作，可是，这大热的天气却经常喝不到开水。这件事，给党总支副书记晏锡武知道了。
    一天，铁厂的食堂的炊事员们正在忙着切菜做饭，一位新炊事员来了。他一到来，立刻帮助大伙切菜、洗碗，不论什么工作他都喜欢干，哪儿忙他就到哪儿去，干起活来满利落。不过，他也有和别的炊事员不同的地方，他不光是埋头干活，而且喜欢看别的炊事员怎么工作，更突出的是他的话多，总是一边干活一边向旁的炊事员问这问那：
    “为什么冶炼车间经常喝不上开水呢？”
    “事情多、时间少，没功夫烧开水呀！”……
    一天跟班完了，新来的炊事员总支副书记晏锡武找到食堂的工作人员一起研究，合理地安排了炊事员的劳动时间，改进了劳动组织。不久，冶炼车间有开水喝了，食堂的饭菜质量也比过去提高了。生产工人们满意，炊事员们也喜笑颜开。
