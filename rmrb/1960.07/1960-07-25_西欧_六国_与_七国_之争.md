The "Six Nations" vs. "Seven Nations" Dispute in Western Europe
郑重 [Zheng Zhong]

(I)

Recently, the two economic blocs in Western Europe: the "European Economic Community" (i.e., the so-called "Six Nations" Common Market) and the "European Free Trade Association" (i.e., the so-called Seven Nations) have successively announced decisions to reduce tariffs by 10% and 20% respectively among their member states, starting from July 1st, in order to combat each other. Thus, all the efforts made by the Western European imperialist countries over the past six months to resolve their irreconcilable contradictions have finally been declared a failure. The long-term division of Western Europe has become inevitable.

The dispute between the Six and Seven Nations, i.e., the struggle between the "European Economic Community" and the "European Free Trade Association," has a long history. This struggle is being carried out on the basis of the shrinking capitalist world market after the war.

The "European Economic Community" was established based on the treaty signed by the six countries in Rome on March 25, 1957. These six countries are France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, with a total population of 168 million. The "European Free Trade Association" was established after an agreement was reached by the ministers of seven countries in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on July 21, 1959. Its members are the United Kingdom, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Portugal, with a total population of 90 million.

Both are organizations that gradually dismantle tariff barriers internally, each with its own characteristics. The "European Economic Community" attempts to achieve political union through economic union, and ultimately form not only a strong economic entity, but also a strong political entity. This group, while gradually eliminating tariff barriers between countries and implementing free trade, requires the establishment of a common tariff system externally to restrict the import of goods from countries outside the group. Internally, it requires the gradual realization of the free flow of labor and capital, and the adjustment of each other's economic policies. Therefore, the "European Economic Community" is both an economic union and a customs union. It is an economic and political entity formed with France and West Germany as the axis, with great ambitions to compete for economic and political hegemony in the world, especially in Europe. The main external purpose of the "European Economic Community" is to confront the Sterling Area, the Dollar Area, and at the same time, confront the socialist camp.

The "European Free Trade Association" was established after the United Kingdom's plan to establish a "European Free Trade Area" was opposed by France and West Germany and failed. This is an organization led by the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to confront the "European Economic Community," use collective strength to exert pressure on the latter, and force it to accept the British plan to establish a "European Free Trade Area," or at least achieve a union between the Six and Seven Nations.

The "European Free Trade Association" does not have the same clear political goals as the "European Economic Community." But it is not entirely without political aims. Its political purpose is for the United Kingdom to dismantle the Franco-German axis and compete for political leadership in Western Europe.

The ultimate goal of the "European Free Trade Association" is to eliminate tariff barriers internally and implement free trade, but it does not require the establishment of a common tariff system externally like the "European Economic Community." External tariffs are decided by each member state. Obviously, this is in line with the interests of the United Kingdom, because the United Kingdom has a set of "Imperial Preference" system for Commonwealth countries. It is unwilling to undermine the special relationship between the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries due to the establishment of the "European Free Trade Association."

(II)

Since both the Six and Seven Nations are taking steps to gradually dismantle tariff barriers to achieve union within their respective groups, what are the specific methods adopted by these two groups in reducing tariffs? A brief explanation is also needed.

The time for the "European Economic Community" to reduce tariff barriers between member states is set at twelve to fifteen years, and the process is divided into three stages. The first stage:

From January 1, 1959, tariffs were reduced by 10%. Thereafter, every eighteen months, the tax rate is reduced by 5% and the total customs revenue is reduced by 10%. By the end of the first stage on January 1, 1962, the degree of tax reduction for each commodity shall not be less than 25%. Second stage: From July 1, 1963 to January 1, 1966, tariffs on each commodity shall be reduced by at least 5% on the original tariff every twelve months, and total customs revenue shall be reduced by 10%.

According to the "Treaty of Rome," at the end of the second stage, the tariff on each commodity must be reduced by at least 50%. The remaining 50% tariff will be determined separately by the Council of Ministers of the Six Nations to determine the timetable for tax reduction in the third stage. The time for the third stage is roughly four years. The end of the third stage should be the time when internal tariff barriers of the "European Economic Community" are completely removed.

The process of tariff reduction in the "European Free Trade Association" is roughly the same as that of the "European Economic Community." In terms of the tax reduction timetable, the Seven Nations are not lagging behind the Six Nations.

According to the plan of the Stockholm Agreement, the tax reduction process of the Seven Nations is as follows:

July 1, 1960, tax reduction of 20%. January 1, 1962, tax reduction of 10%. July 1, 1963, tax reduction of 10%. January 1, 1965, tax reduction of 10%.

After July 1, 1960, the distance between each tax reduction is eighteen months. By January 1, 1965, tariffs should be reduced by 50%. The remaining 50% will be reduced over five years, i.e., 10% will be reduced every January 1st thereafter. According to this plan, the internal tariff barriers of the "European Free Trade Association" can be completely eliminated by January 1, 1970.

(III)

After the "European Economic Community" and the "European Free Trade Association" were established successively, Western Europe formed two opposing economic blocs, each with its own specific demands and purposes, and each with its own timetable for abolishing tariffs and realizing free trade within the group.

The struggle between the two groups is becoming increasingly acute and blatant. Especially after the "European Economic Community Commission" put forward the so-called "Hallstein Plan" on March 3 this year to shorten the time and accelerate the realization of the "Common Market," the struggle between the two groups has become more intense, and this wave of struggle has impacted the entire capitalist world.

The struggle between the two groups is mainly reflected between the United Kingdom and the Franco-German axis.

Hallstein is the chairman of the "European Economic Community Commission." He is a loyal executor of Adenauer's policies. The "European Economic Community Commission" is the administrative body that implements policies related to the "Common Market." The committee can make decisions or suggest that the Council of Ministers of the Six Nations consider specific issues related to the "Common Market."

The "Hallstein Plan" is the specific plan formulated by this committee to accelerate the realization of the "Common Market."

The reason for proposing this plan is that the economies of the member states of the "European Economic Community" have developed rapidly in recent years. The committee believes that the favorable situation of economic development of the six countries should be fully utilized to strike while the iron is hot, shorten the transition time of the "Common Market," and realize the ideal of the "Common Market" as soon as possible.

Undeniably, the economic development of the six countries, whether in the speed of industrial production or in the scale of international trade, has greatly exceeded that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Since 1953, the industrial production index of the six countries has increased from one hundred to one hundred and fifty-eight, while the industrial production index of the United Kingdom has only increased to one hundred and twenty, and that of the United States has only increased to one hundred and eleven.

In the past year, the industrial production of the six countries has increased by 7% compared with the average level of 1958. In 1958, it only increased by 3%. The foreign trade of the six countries has also developed significantly. In 1959, the exports of the six countries to the United Kingdom increased by 7% compared with 1958, and exports to countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" increased by 4%. The total value of trade between "Common Market" countries increased by 19% compared with 1958. The country that benefited the most from export trade in the "Common Market" countries was France, whose export trade increased by 34% compared with 1958.

In the past year, the overall economic situation of the "Common Market" countries was that fixed capital investment reached an extremely high level, and investment was concentrated in industries such as steel, machinery, and chemicals. The increase in domestic investment in these countries has brought about higher productivity. Export trade has been further expanded, trade prices have stabilized, and foreign trade, which was originally a deficit of 19 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 1959, turned into a surplus of 521 million U.S. dollars in the last quarter.

Based on the greatly favorable economic situation of the six countries, the committee headed by Hallstein proposed a plan to shorten the process of the "Common Market." In fact, before this plan was put forward, France had advocated reducing tariffs by 20% in advance to replace the original 10% stipulated in the Treaty of Rome; at the same time, it also advocated establishing a preliminary common external tariff system to realize the plan originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1, 1962 in advance. Therefore, the proposal of the Hallstein Plan is inseparable from France's active advocacy.

Hallstein's plan to shorten the timetable for the "Common Market" is manifested in the fact that from July 1 this year, tariffs will be reduced by 20% within the common market, and tariffs will be reduced by another 20% on January 1, 1962, to replace the original tax reduction of 10% each time stipulated in the "Treaty of Rome." In this way, the original plan that internal tariffs should be reduced by 50% by the end of the second stage, i.e., by January 1, 1966, will be realized at the end of the first stage according to Hallstein's proposal. In this way, the tax reduction time is shortened by at least four years.

(IV)

After Hallstein put forward the plan to shorten the process of the "Common Market," it caused a great shock in the capitalist world, especially in Western Europe. The views of countries in the capitalist world on the "Hallstein Plan" are extremely inconsistent.

The United States' attitude is to welcome the "Hallstein Plan," believing that the "Hallstein Plan" is in line with the ideal of the "Marshall Plan," that is, to establish a strong political entity in Europe. In the eyes of the ruling class in the United States, accelerating the completion of the "Common Market" is precisely accelerating the realization of their desire to establish a strong political group in Europe. The reason why the United States supports the "European Economic Community" and the "Hallstein Plan" is from a political perspective. This is to use the European political group centered on France and West Germany to contain the United Kingdom on the one hand and confront the Eastern European socialist countries on the other.

France's attitude is also to support the "Hallstein Plan." Due to the improvement of the French economy over the past year, the improvement of industrial productivity, especially after the devaluation of the French franc, has created a favorable situation for the prices of industrial products to compete within the "Common Market." Therefore, France actively advocates accelerating the implementation of the "Common Market" plan. Of course, De Gaulle's ambition to dominate Europe has further promoted France's support for this plan.

However, France does not advocate Hallstein's proposal to reduce the common external tariffs of the six countries by 20%, believing that it is still too early to do so and should be proposed at the meeting of countries participating in the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" this fall as a bargaining chip. That is to say, only if other countries of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" also take the same tax reduction measures can they enjoy the tax reduction treatment of the "Common Market."

The West German government has two factions for and against the "Hallstein Plan." Those who agree with the Hallstein Plan include Chancellor Adenauer, Foreign Minister Brentano, and Finance Minister Etzel; those who oppose it include Economics Minister Erhard and Agriculture Minister Schwarz.

The opposition represents the interests of a part of the West German business and agricultural circles. Their reasons for opposing the "Hallstein Plan" are:

(1) The seven countries of the "European Free Trade Area," like the six countries in the "Common Market," are good markets for West German export trade. The "Hallstein Plan" can only deepen the division between the Six and Seven Nations, thereby affecting West German export trade to the Seven Nations.

(2) The result of West Germany's increase in import taxes will make the prices of imported raw materials expensive, thereby increasing the cost of industrial production, which is not conducive to export competition, and will further worsen West Germany's inflation situation.

(3) West Germany's agricultural products rely on foreign supplies. After the increase in tariffs, food prices will increase, thereby affecting the increase in domestic living expenses.

Belgium and the Netherlands have roughly the same attitude towards the "Hallstein Plan," and they all have certain reservations. The efficiency of Belgian industry is not the highest among the "Common Market" countries. The coal mining industry was originally a basic industry in Belgium, but it has been overwhelmed by the new and powerful West German coal mining industry. Therefore, the implementation of the "Hallstein Plan" will aggravate its difficulties. The Netherlands is also unwilling to fall out with the United Kingdom because of its agricultural products' relationship with the British market.

(V)

The attitude of the Seven Nations, especially the United Kingdom, towards the "Hallstein Plan" can be seen from their trade relations with the "Common Market" countries and the impact of the "Hallstein Plan" on their trade after its implementation.

The trade relations and conflicts of interest between the United Kingdom and the Seven Nations and the "Common Market" countries are as follows: The proportion of "Common Market" countries in the total value of British export trade is about 15%. Among them, West Germany accounts for 4.6% of the total value of British export trade, the Netherlands 3.5%, Belgium and Luxembourg 1.9%, Italy 2.2%, and France 2.5%.

In 1958, the total value of exports from the Seven Nations Free Trade Area to the "Common Market" countries accounted for 23% of the total value of exports from the Seven Nations, while the value of mutual exports between the Seven Nations only accounted for 17%. In addition, the value of exports from the "Common Market" countries to the Seven Nations Free Trade Area accounted for 22% of the total value of exports from the six countries, while the value of mutual exports within the six countries accounted for 30%.

From the perspective of individual countries, the trade of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in 1958 with the Seven Nations was greater than the trade with the "Common Market" countries, while the trade of the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, and Portugal, especially Austria and Switzerland, with the "Common Market" countries was greater than the trade between the Seven Nations.

Apart from Commonwealth countries, West Germany is the main market for British export trade. In 1958, the total value of British exports decreased by nearly 5%, but exports to West Germany increased by 18%. In that year, the value of British export trade to West Germany reached 122.6 million pounds, which had increased to 137.8 million pounds in 1959.

If the "Hallstein Plan" is implemented, British export trade to West Germany will undoubtedly be greatly affected in the future. West Germany is a low-tax country. According to the "Hallstein Plan," after West Germany raises external tariffs, the import tax levied by West Germany on British goods will be twice as high as the import tax on goods from "Common Market" countries. For example, in 1959, washing machines imported by West Germany from the United Kingdom accounted for half of all washing machines imported by West Germany. The other half was imported from "Common Market" countries. According to the "Hallstein Plan," in the future, West Germany's import tax on washing machines from "Common Market" countries will be reduced from 7% to 6%, while the import tax on British washing machines will increase from 7% to 10%.

The same is true for automobiles. The import tax on automobiles in West Germany was originally 16%. According to the "Hallstein Plan," the import tax levied by West Germany on automobiles produced in "Common Market" countries will be reduced to 14%, while the import tax on automobiles produced in the United Kingdom will increase to 24%.

After the implementation of the "Hallstein Plan," West Germany's external tariffs will need to be increased on nearly one-third of the commodities, and the remaining two-thirds will remain unchanged or be slightly reduced. Among the commodity items that need to increase import taxes, food accounts for 44.6%, raw materials account for 2.8%, semi-finished products account for 43.9%, production materials account for 69.4%, and finished products account for 55.4%. The goods exported by the United Kingdom to West Germany are exactly the latter two: finished products and production materials.

The "Common Market" is a great threat to the United Kingdom. The first is the continuous increase in industrial production in the "Common Market," which makes the United Kingdom's share in the international market shrink day by day. Since 1953, British industrial production has only increased by about 20%, while West German industrial production has increased by 72%, and French industrial production has increased by 76%. At the same time, the United Kingdom's share in the export of industrial manufactured goods in the international market has decreased from 25% in 1950 to 16.6% in 1959, while West Germany has increased from 7% in 1950 to 20% in 1959.

The second is the threat of agricultural products. The requirements for agricultural development in the "Common Market" are not only to achieve self-sufficiency, but also to achieve exports. In this way, countries and colonies within the Sterling Area that specialize in exporting agricultural products and industrial raw materials face serious threats.

Another threat of the "Common Market" to the United Kingdom is to accelerate the centrifugal tendency of the Commonwealth. Many countries within the Commonwealth system are gradually turning to the "Common Market" to seek sources of funds and stable markets for export trade. The most prominent example is that the New Zealand government recently prepared to abolish some of the preferential treatment for the United Kingdom under the Imperial Preference system in order to develop trade between New Zealand and France and other countries. Ghana has bypassed London and turned to West Germany for loans because of the lower interest rates in the West German market. At the same time, West Germany has actively exported capital to Commonwealth countries and colonies in recent years. These phenomena are all very worrying for the United Kingdom.

The consequences of the development of the "Common Market" can be imagined for the United Kingdom. The several reasons mentioned above are certainly important, but more importantly, the United Kingdom's position in Europe is becoming increasingly isolated due to the establishment of the "Common Market." Therefore, the United Kingdom is extremely dissatisfied with the organization of the "Common Market," and even more opposed to the "Hallstein Plan" without reservation.

(VI)

In order to resist the threat of the "Hallstein Plan," the United Kingdom gathered its "European Free Trade Association" Seven Nations immediately after the plan was announced, and threatened to retaliate against the Six Nations by accelerating the reduction of internal tariffs. At the same time, it also expressed its willingness to "shake hands and make peace" to the Six Nations' "Common Market," as long as they change their position and can still negotiate on a reciprocal basis.

In this way, on the one hand, there is the pressure of the Seven Nations, and on the other hand, there are inconsistent opinions within the "Common Market." Therefore, in mid-May of this year, the Council of Ministers of the "Common Market" finally made some non-principle revisions to the "Hallstein Plan" and decided to postpone the implementation of the plan to January 1, 1961, in order to ease the contradictions. However, this approach did not help to change the tense situation between the two groups. In order to avoid serious division and the huge damage caused by retaliation to both sides, the Six and Seven Nations conducted another round of negotiations on "avoiding the economic division of Europe" through the Paris Twenty-Nation Conference in June this year. Before the negotiations, French President De Gaulle, who had always been the most hostile to the United Kingdom on the "Common Market" issue, also made "hopeful" remarks, saying that France was willing to "reach an understanding" with Western European countries other than the Six Nations and seek "adjustments of interests." The British side also released "friendly" air, saying that the United Kingdom may participate in the "European Coal and Steel Community" and the "European Atomic Energy Community Organization" in order to please France. However, shortly after the meeting began, both sides discovered that their positions were still far apart. The United Kingdom's plan to "unite" the Six and Seven Nations in order to realize its "large free trade area" was still resolutely rejected by the Six Nations. Even its plan to "unite" the Six and Seven Nations in some form was not considered by the other party. In the words of British Trade Minister Reginald Maudling, "The Six Nations are unwilling to negotiate any 'fundamental issues,' and are even unwilling to state the conditions they are considering for negotiating an alliance with the Seven Nations." On the other hand, Eugen Schaus, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the "European Economic Community," said categorically on June 13: "If the United Kingdom really intends to join the 'Common Market,' it must accept the same obligations in terms of institutions as the Six Nations accepted a year ago." The negotiations finally broke down because the United Kingdom was unwilling to accept the obligations of the "Common Market" for the sake of the interests of the Sterling Area, and West Germany and France were unwilling to allow the United Kingdom to intervene in the "Common Market" in any other way.

The prospect of increasingly close economic and political integration of the "Common Market" countries centered on West Germany and France thus further threatened the United Kingdom's position in Western Europe. The United Kingdom's plan to dismantle this alliance in every possible way for "self-defense" has also repeatedly failed.

Of course, the United Kingdom's failure is also inseparable from the United States' behind-the-scenes support for the "Common Market" Six Nations. Even before the Seven Nations negotiated with the Six Nations, U.S. officials had repeatedly expressed support for the Six Nations and did not want to see the union of the two groups. Jan Hasbrouck, a European affairs columnist for the "New York Herald Tribune," also reiterated on May 31: "The United States is extremely unwilling to see (any solution achieved between the Six and Seven Nations)." Originally, the United States' intention was to suppress the United Kingdom on the one hand, and to take advantage of this serious division in Western Europe on the other. Recently, Brandon, the Washington correspondent of the British "Sunday Times," said that the United States "hopes that a new organization and development with the United States and Canada as formal members can become a catalyst for the kind of relationship between Britain and the continent." In other words, the relationship between the Six and Seven Nations is to be decided by the United States.

The capitalist world's struggle for markets and hegemony is thus fully reflected in the dispute between the Six and Seven Nations in Western Europe. Despite the constant clamor of so-called "Atlantic solidarity" and "mutual dependence," it is impossible for the imperialist robbers not to have major differences due to the extreme inconsistency of their interests. All these prove that Lenin's saying that the nature of imperialism's demand for redivision of the world market has not changed in the slightest. No matter how the representatives of imperialism want people to believe that there is an atmosphere of harmony between them, their interests will ultimately be irreconcilable.

    西欧“六国”与“七国”之争
    郑重
   （一）
    最近西欧的两个经济集团：“欧洲经济集团”（即所谓“六国”共同市场）和“欧洲自由贸易联盟”（即所谓七国）先后宣布了从7月1日起在自己的会员国之间分别减税10％和20％以打击对方的决定。这样，半年来西欧帝国主义国家为了解决它们之间不可调和的矛盾而作的一切努力终于宣告失败。西欧的长期分裂遂成为不可避免。
    六国和七国之争，即“欧洲经济集团”和“欧洲自由贸易联盟”之间的斗争由来已久。这个斗争是在战后资本主义世界市场日益缩小的基础上进行的。
    “欧洲经济集团”是根据1957年3月25日六国在罗马签订的条约建立起来的。这六国是法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡，共有人口一亿六千八百万。“欧洲自由贸易联盟”是1959年7月21日七国部长在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩达成协议后建立起来的，它的成员是英国、奥国、丹麦、瑞典、挪威、瑞士、葡萄牙，共有人口九千万。
    这两个都是实行在内部逐渐拆除关税壁垒的组织，各有其特点。“欧洲经济集团”是企图通过经济联合，达到政治联合，最后组成一个不仅是强有力的经济整体，并且是强有力的政治整体；这个集团，在逐渐消除国与国间的关税壁垒，实行自由贸易时，对外要求建立一个共同关税制度，限制集团以外国家的商品进口。对内则要求逐步实现劳动力和资本的自由流通，并调整彼此的经济政策。因此，“欧洲经济集团”既是经济联盟，同时又是个关税联盟。它是以法国—西德为轴心所形成起来的经济整体和政治整体，有着很大的野心，企图争夺世界上，特别是欧洲的经济和政治霸权。“欧洲经济集团”对外的主要目的是对抗英镑集团，美元集团，同时对抗社会主义阵营。
    “欧洲自由贸易联盟”，是在英国建立“欧洲自由贸易区”的计划受到法国和西德反对失败之后建立起来的。这是以英国为主导的组织。它的目的是对抗“欧洲经济集团”，使用集体力量，对后者施加压力，逼其接受英国要求建立“欧洲自由贸易区”的计划，或是最低限度达到六国和七国间的联合。
    “欧洲自由贸易联盟”不具有像“欧洲经济集团”那样鲜明的政治目标。但也并不是全没有政治目的。它的政治目的就是英国想拆散法国—西德轴心，争夺西欧政治领导权。
    “欧洲自由贸易联盟”的最终目的，要求对内消灭关税障碍，实行自由贸易，但对外则不要求建立像“欧洲经济集团”那样的共同关税制度。对外关税由各成员国家自行决定。很显然，这是符合英国的利益的，因为英国对英联邦国家有一套“帝国优惠待遇”制。它不愿意因“欧洲自由贸易联盟”的建立，而破坏英国与英联邦国家间的特殊关系。
    （二）
    六国和七国既然都是采取逐渐拆除关税壁垒的步骤以达到本集团内的联合，那么这两个集团在削减关税方面采取的具体办法又如何呢？对此也需要作一简单说明。
    “欧洲经济集团”削减成员国家间的关税壁垒的时间定为十二年至十五年，其过程分三个阶段。第一阶段：
    从1959年1月1日起，减低关税10％。以后每隔十八个月减低税率5％，减低海关总收入10％。到1962年1月1日第一阶段的终了时每种商品的减税程度不得低于25％。第二阶段：从1963年7月1日起，到1966年1月1日止，每种商品每隔十二个月在原来的关税上至少减低关税5％，减低海关总收入10％。
    按照“罗马条约”在第二阶段终了时，每种商品的关税，最低限度须减少50％。其余50％的关税，由六国部长会议另行规定第三阶段减税时间表。第三阶段的时间，大致为四年。第三阶段终了时，应该是“欧洲经济集团”内部关税障碍完全拆除之时。
    “欧洲自由贸易联盟”的减税过程同“欧洲经济集团”大致吻合。在减税时间表上，七国并不落后于六国。
    按照斯德哥尔摩协议的计划，七国减税过程如下：
    1960年7月1日减税20％。1962年1月1日减税10％。1963年7月1日减税10％。1965年1月1日减税10％。
    1960年7月1日之后，每次减税的距离时间为十八个月，至1965年1月1日应减去关税50％，其余50％，分作五年削减，即以后每年1月1日减去10％。按照这个计划，“欧洲自由贸易联盟”内部的关税壁垒，待至1970年1月1日即可完全消除。
    （三）
    “欧洲经济集团”和“欧洲自由贸易联盟”先后建立之后，西欧形成两个互相对峙的经济集团，各有其一定的要求和目的，各有其达到取消关税，实现集团内部自由贸易的时间表。
    两个集团的斗争，愈来愈尖锐，愈来愈露骨。特别是今年3月3日“欧洲经济集团委员会”提出缩短时间，加速实现“共同市场”的所谓“哈尔斯坦计划”之后，两个集团的斗争，更趋激烈，这一斗争浪潮已冲击着整个资本主义世界。
    两个集团的斗争，集中表现在英国和法国—西德轴心之间。
    哈尔斯坦是“欧洲经济集团委员会”的主席。他是阿登纳政策的忠实执行者。“欧洲经济集团委员会”是执行有关“共同市场”政策方针的行政机构。对于“共同市场”的具体问题，这个委员会可以作出决定，或建议六国部长会议考虑。
    “哈尔斯坦计划”就是这个委员会制订的加速实现“共同市场”的具体方案。
    提出这个计划的理由是由于“欧洲经济集团”的成员国家近年来的经济发展很快。委员会认为应充分利用六国经济发展的有利形势趁热打铁，缩短“共同市场”的过渡时间，早日实现“共同市场”的理想。
    不可否认，六国的经济发展，无论在工业生产速度，或在国际贸易规模上，都大大超过英、美两国。自1953年来，六国的工业生产指数已从一百增至一百五十八，而英国的工业生产指数只增至一百二十，美国的只增至一百一十一。
    去年一年内，六国的工业生产同1958年的平均水平相比增加了7％。而1958年只增加3％。六国的对外贸易，也有显著的发展，1959年六国对英国的出口比1958年增加了7％，对“欧洲经济合作局”国家的出口增加了4％；而“共同市场”国家间互相出口的贸易总值，比1958年增加了19％。“共同市场”国家在出口贸易上获益最大的是法国，它的出口贸易比1958年提高了34％。
    去年一年，“共同市场”国家总的经济形势是固定资本投资达到了极高的水平，投资集中于钢铁、机械、化学等工业部门。这些国家国内投资的增加，带来了更高的生产率。出口贸易进一步扩大了，贸易价格稳定，对外贸易在1959年的第一季度原为逆差一千九百万美元，到最末季度时转变为盈余五亿二千一百万美元。
    以哈尔斯坦为首的委员会，基于六国经济情况大大有利的形势，提出了缩短“共同市场”过程的计划。实际上，在这个计划提出之前，法国就曾主张提前实行减低关税20％，以代替罗马条约原来所规定的10％；同时，并主张建立初步的对外共同关税制，提早实现原订1962年1月1日始实行的计划。因此哈尔斯坦计划的提出是同法国的积极倡议分不开的。
    哈尔斯坦缩短“共同市场”过渡时间表的计划，表现于关税方面的是从今年7月1日起，共同市场内部，减低关税20％，待到1962年1月1日再减低关税20％，以代替“罗马条约”原来规定的每次减税10％。这样，原来规定须至第二阶段终了时，即至1966年1月1日，内部关税始减去50％的计划，按哈尔斯坦的建议，将提前至第一阶段的终了时即予实现。似此，减税的时间，至少缩短了四年。
    （四）
    在哈尔斯坦提出缩短“共同市场”过程的计划之后，资本主义世界，特别是在西欧方面，引起了很大的震动。资本主义世界国家，对于“哈尔斯坦计划”的看法极不一致。
    美国的态度是欢迎“哈尔斯坦计划”的，认为“哈尔斯坦计划”是符合“马歇尔计划”的理想，即在欧洲建立一个强大的政治整体。在美国的统治阶级看来，加速建成“共同市场”，正是加速实现他们在欧洲建立强大政治集团的愿望。美国之所以支持“欧洲经济集团”，支持“哈尔斯坦计划”，是从政治的角度考虑。这就是利用以法国和西德为中心的欧洲政治集团，一面牵制英国，一面对抗东欧社会主义国家。
    法国的态度也是支持“哈尔斯坦计划”的。由于法国经济一年多来有了好转，工业生产率提高，特别是法郎贬值后，造成工业品价格在“共同市场”内竞争的有利形势，因此，法国积极主张加速实现“共同市场”计划。当然，戴高乐的野心勃勃，想称雄欧洲，更加促进了法国对这一计划的支持。
    但是，法国却不主张哈尔斯坦提出的将六国对外共同关税减低20％，认为目前这样作还为时过早，应待参加“关税及贸易总协定”的国家于本年秋季开会时再提出，作为讨价还价的资本。这就是说只有“关税及贸易总协定”的其他国家也采取相同的减税措施，才能享受“共同市场”的减税待遇。
    西德政府对于“哈尔斯坦计划”，有赞成和反对两派。赞成哈尔斯坦计划的有阿登纳总理，外交部长勃伦塔诺，和财政部长艾策尔；反对的有经济部长艾哈德和农业部长施瓦茨。
    反对派是代表西德一部分工商界和农业界的利益的。他们反对“哈尔斯坦计划”的理由是：
    （1）“欧洲自由贸易区”的七个国家，同“共同市场”内的六个国家一样，都是西德出口贸易的良好市场，“哈尔斯坦计划”只能加深六国、七国的分裂，从而影响西德对七国的出口贸易。
    （2）西德提高进口税的结果，将使进口原料价格昂贵从而使工业生产成本提高，不利于出口竞争，并且将使西德通货膨胀的形势，更进一步恶化。
    （3）西德农产品仰赖国外供应，提高关税后将增加食品价格，从而影响国内生活费用的提高。
    比利时与荷兰对“哈尔斯坦计划”的态度大致相同，都有一定的保留。比利时的工业，在“共同市场”国家中效能不是顶高。煤矿工业原是比利时的基本工业，但是已被西德新型和强大有力的煤矿工业所压垮。因此“哈尔斯坦计划”的执行会加重它的困难。荷兰为了它的农产品同英国市场的关系也不愿同英国闹翻。
    （五）
    七国，特别是英国对“哈尔斯坦计划”的态度可以从它们同“共同市场”国家间的贸易关系以及“哈尔斯坦计划”实现后对它们的贸易影响看出。
    英国和七国同“共同市场”国家的贸易关系利害与冲突如下：“共同市场”国家在英国出口贸易的总值中所占的比重为15％左右。其中西德占英国出口贸易总值的4.6％，荷兰3.5％，比利时、卢森堡1.9％，意大利2.2％，法国2.5％。
    1958年，七国自由贸易区对“共同市场”国家的出口总值占七国对外出口总值的23％，而七国间的相互出口值只占17％。又“共同市场”国家对七国自由贸易区的出口值，占六国出口贸易总值的22％，而六国内相互出口值则占30％。
    从个别国家说，瑞典、挪威、丹麦1958年与七国内部的贸易，要大于对“共同市场”国家的贸易，而英国、奥国、瑞士、葡萄牙，特别是奥国和瑞士对“共同市场”国家的贸易，都大于对七国间的贸易。
    除英联邦国家之外，西德是英国出口贸易的主要市场。1958年英国出口总值减少近5％，可是对西德的出口却增加18％。是年，英国对西德出口贸易价值达一亿二千二百六十万镑，1959年已增至一亿三千七百八十万镑。
    如果“哈尔斯坦计划”得以实现，则今后英国对西德的出口贸易，无疑要受到很大影响。西德是个低税国家，按照“哈尔斯坦计划”，西德对外关税提高后，西德对英国商品所加的进口税将一倍于对“共同市场”国家的商品入口税。例如，1959年西德从英国进口的洗衣机占西德全部进口洗衣机的一半，其他一半，系从“共同市场”国家进口，照“哈尔斯坦计划”，今后西德对“共同市场”国家的洗衣机进口税将从7％减为6％，而对英国洗衣机的进口税，则从7％增至10％。
    汽车亦是如此。西德对汽车的进口税原为16％，照“哈尔斯坦计划”西德对“共同市场”国家出产的汽车所加的进口税将减为14％，而对英国出产的汽车的进口税将增至24％。
    执行“哈尔斯坦计划”后的西德对外关税，近三分之一的商品需要提高，其余三分之二不变动或酌量减低。需要提高进口税的商品项目中，食品占44.6％，原料占2.8％，半制成品占43.9％，生产资料占69.4％，制成品占55.4％。而英国向西德出口的商品正好是后面的两种：制成品和生产资料。
    “共同市场”对英国来说是个很大的威胁。首先是“共同市场”工业生产的不断提高，使英国在国际市场的地盘日益缩小。自1953年以来，英国工业生产只增加20％左右，西德的工业生产却增加了72％，法国增加了76％，同时，英国在国际市场的工业制成品出口方面的比重，从1950年的25％降至1959年的16.6％，而西德却从1950年的7％增长至1959年的20％。
    其次是农业产品的威胁。“共同市场”农业发展的要求，不仅要达到自给自足目的，而且要达到向外出口。这样，就使英镑区内专门依靠农产品和工业原料出口的国家和殖民地面临严重的威胁。
    “共同市场”对英国的另一个威胁，是加快英联邦的离心倾向。使英联邦体系内的许多国家，都逐渐转向“共同市场”寻求资金来源，和出口贸易的稳定市场。最显著的例子是新西兰政府最近准备取消一部分在帝国优惠制度下对英国的优惠待遇办法，以便开展新西兰同法国和其他国家间的贸易。加纳，由于西德市场利息较低，已绕过伦敦转向西德借款。同时，西德近年来已积极地向英联邦国家和殖民地输出资本。这些现象，对英国来说，都是很可忧虑的。
    “共同市场”发展的结果，带给英国的打击是可以设想的。上面所述的几个理由，固然是重要的，但更重要的是英国在欧洲的地位因“共同市场”的建立而日益孤立。因此，英国对于“共同市场”的组织是极端不满的，对于“哈尔斯坦计划”，更是反对不遗余力。
    （六）
    为了抵制“哈尔斯坦计划”的威胁，英国在这个计划刚一宣布之后就聚集了它的“欧洲自由贸易联盟”七国，扬言要用加速降低内部关税的办法对六国进行报复，同时又向六国“共同市场”表示愿意“握手言和”，只要它们改变主张，仍可在互惠的基础上进行谈判。
    这样，一方面有七国的压力，另一方面“共同市场”内部意见又不一致，于是今年5月中旬“共同市场”部长理事会终于对“哈尔斯坦计划”作了一些非原则的修正，并决定把这个计划推迟到1961年1月1日再开始执行，以便缓和矛盾。但是这种作法并无助于改变两个集团间的剑拔弩张的局势。为了避免严重的决裂和报复给双方带来的巨大损害，六国和七国之间于今年6月通过巴黎二十国会议又进行了一场所谓“避免欧洲经济上的分裂”的谈判。在谈判之前，一向在“共同市场”问题上最敌视英国的法国总统戴高乐，还发表了“令人抱希望的”谈话，说什么法国愿意同六国以外的西欧国家“取得谅解”，并且寻求“利益的调整”。英国方面也放出“友好”空气，说英国可能参加“欧洲煤钢联营”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”，以讨好法国。但是会谈开始后不久，双方就都发现它们的立场仍然相去甚远。英国想使六国和七国“联合”起来好实现它的“大自由贸易区”的计划仍然为六国所断然拒绝。甚至它的使六国和七国以某种形式“联合”的计划，也不为对方所考虑。用英国贸易部大臣雷金纳德·莫德林的话来说，就是：“六国不愿意谈判任何‘基本问题’，甚至不愿说明它们所考虑的同七国谈判结成联盟的条件”。另一方面，“欧洲经济集团”部长理事会主席欧仁·绍斯6月13日则斩钉截铁地说：“如果英国真打算加入‘共同市场’，它就必须在机构方面接受同六国在一年以前所接受的同样义务。”谈判终于仍在英国为了英镑集团利益，不肯接受“共同市场”的义务，西德和法国又不肯以任何其他方式允许英国插足“共同市场”而宣告破裂。
    以西德和法国为中心的“共同市场”国家在经济和政治上的日益密切结合的前景，就这样更加威胁着英国在西欧的地位。英国为了“自卫”，千方百计地拆散这个联盟的计划也一再遭到失败。
    当然，英国的失败也是同美国幕后极力支持“共同市场”六国分不开。就在七国同六国谈判之前，美国的官员们已多次表示支持六国，并不愿看到这两个集团的联合。“纽约先驱论坛报”欧洲事务专栏作家杨·哈斯布鲁克5月31日还重申：“美国极不愿意看到（六国和七国之间获致）任何解决。”原来美国的意图一面是在压制英国，一面也是要利用西欧的这种严重分裂来从中渔利。最近英国“星期日泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者布兰敦就说，美国“希望以美国和加拿大作为正式成员的一个新组织和发展，可以成为英国和大陆之间的那种关系的触媒剂”。换句话说，就是六国和七国之间的关系要由美国来作出决定。
    资本主义世界争夺市场、争夺霸权的斗争就这样在西欧六国和七国之争上得到充分反映。尽管有所谓“大西洋团结”“互相依靠”的不断叫嚷，可是帝国主义强盗们由于利害的极不一致，要使它们不发生重大分歧是不可能的。所有这些都证明列宁所说的，帝国主义要求重新分割世界市场的本性丝毫没有改变。不管帝国主义的代表们怎样要人们相信他们之间充满和谐气氛，它们之间的利益终久是无法调和的。
