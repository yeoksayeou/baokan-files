Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, July 29th: Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Nanfen Concentrator, adhering to the principle of quality first in production, has formulated a set of measures to ensure high-quality and high-yield production. This year, the iron content of the refined sand has reached over 65%, and the iron powder recovery rate has reached over 78%, both setting record highs. At the National Black Ore Dressing Competition and Appraisal Meeting held in Nanfen on July 18th, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry once again awarded the factory the National Advanced and High-Yielding Red Flag for large concentrators.

According to the original design specifications, the iron content of Nanfen Concentrator's concentrate powder should be 60%. In 1958, the iron content of the factory's concentrate powder reached 63%, earning it the title of a national advanced iron ore factory. However, the workers were not satisfied with this achievement. They were determined to raise the iron content of the concentrate powder by another 2%. However, some people said: If the iron content is further increased, the iron powder recovery rate will definitely decrease; the contradiction between improving the quality and quantity of the concentrator seems like washing rice. If you wash it too many times, the rice is better, but the amount of rice is less. In response to this view, the Party committee organized a mass debate among the workers. The conclusion of the debate was six words: There are contradictions, but they can be unified. Based on this understanding, leading cadres immediately went deep into the production site and organized "three-in-one" groups to find ways to get both good "rice" and not lose "rice" through specific experiments. They first experimented with recovering the iron powder carried away by tailings (i.e., waste rock, soil, and water left over after ore selection) to create conditions for increasing the number of washing times for the mineral powder and improving the quality of the mineral powder. The method initially envisioned by everyone was to build a large wooden trough 20 meters long and 1 meter wide to allow the tailings to flow through. During the flowing process, the iron powder, due to its heavy weight, would settle to the bottom of the trough, and the waste residue, due to its light weight, would float on top and flow away. Later, some transmission equipment was added to transform it into an automatic shaking table. This shaking table increased the recovery rate by 2% compared to the past. Now, the factory uses more than 60 shaking tables, which can recover hundreds of tons of concentrate powder from the tailings every day. With this shaking table, the workers said: The contradiction between quality and high yield can be resolved. We can wash our "rice" several more times to improve quality, because the "rice" carried away by the tailings during the washing process can still be recovered. Since then, the number of ore washing times in the entire factory has generally increased by one or two times compared to the past, the quality of the concentrate powder has increased by more than 1%, and the iron powder recovery rate has not only not decreased but has also increased.

After adopting this measure, the leading cadres of the factory used the method of "cultivating experimental fields" to go to the workshops and summarize experience together with workers and technicians. Finally, with the help of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the entire factory formulated a complete set of operating principles based on strong magnetism as the guiding principle, equipment maintenance as the foundation, and implementing high current, low concentration, fine grinding, and diligent recovery. This resolved the contradiction between high yield and high quality in the factory, making the entire factory a national advanced and high-yielding red flag for large concentrators.

### 既要矿粉好又要矿粉多  南芬选矿厂一面增加选洗次数一面提高回收率  再次夺得全国大型选矿厂的优质高产红旗

    既要矿粉好又要矿粉多
    南芬选矿厂一面增加选洗次数一面提高回收率
    再次夺得全国大型选矿厂的优质高产红旗
    新华社本溪29日电　本溪钢铁公司南芬选矿厂，在生产中坚持质量第一，制订了一套保证生产优质高产的措施，使今年以来的精砂含铁量达到了65％以上，铁粉回收率达到了78％以上，两项指标都创造了最高纪录。冶金工业部7月18日在南芬举行的全国黑色选矿竞赛评比会议，再次评选这个厂为全国大型选矿厂的优质高产红旗。
    南芬选矿厂按原设计规定，精矿粉的含铁量为60％。1958年这个厂的精矿粉含铁量达到了63％，获得了当时全国大型铁矿厂红旗单位的称号。但是，职工们并不满足这个成绩。他们立志要把精矿粉含铁量再提高2％。可是有些人说：再提高含铁量，铁粉回收率一定得降低；选矿厂提高质量和产量的这个矛盾，好像淘米一样，淘的次数多了，米虽然好了，但米的数量就少了。针对这个看法，党委组织了职工大辩论。大伙辩论的结论是六个字：有矛盾，能统一。在这个认识的基础上，领导干部立即深入生产现场，组织“三结合”小组，通过具体试验，寻找既要“米”好，又不让“米”少的办法。他们首先试验回收尾矿（即矿石选后剩下的岩石、土泥和水等废物）带走的铁粉，为增加矿粉的选洗次数、提高矿粉的质量创造条件。大伙开头设想的办法是造一个二十米长、一米宽的大木槽，让尾矿顺槽流过。尾矿在流动的过程中，铁粉因重量大，便沉淀到槽底，废渣因重量轻便浮在上面流走。后来又加上部分传动设备，改制成了一种自动摇床。这种摇床使回收率比过去提高2％。现在，全厂用六十多台摇床，每天能从尾矿中收回数百吨精矿粉。有了这种摇床工人们说：优质和高产的矛盾可以解决了，咱们的“米”可以多淘几次来提高质量了，反正在淘的过程中被尾矿带走的“米”，还能收回来。从此，全厂矿石的选洗次数一般都比过去增加一、两次，精矿粉的质量提高了1％以上，而铁粉的回收率不仅未降低，而且提高了。
    这个厂的领导干部采取了这一措施以后，又用“种试验田”的办法，下车间和工人、技术人员一起，总结经验。最后，在冶金工业部的帮助下，全厂拟定了以强磁为纲，以设备维护为基础，实行高电流、低浓度、细磨、勤回收等一整套操作方针，解决了本厂高产和优质的矛盾，使全厂成为全国大型选矿厂的优质高产红旗。
