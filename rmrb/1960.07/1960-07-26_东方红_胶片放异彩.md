    "Dongfanghong" Film Releasing Splendor
    A color film of the same name, adapted from the famous novel "Red Flag Story" by writer Liang Bin, will soon be completed at the Beijing Film Studio. The color movie film used to shoot this film is the "Dongfanghong" brand product produced by Tianjin Photographic Film Factory.
    In 1956, this factory was still a "three-few" factory, described as having "few workers, few equipment, and few products". At that time, the entire factory only had one small machine that could only produce photographic glass dry plates and photographic paper. In just over three years, this factory has become a main force in China's emerging photosensitive material industry. Not long ago, at a national technical experience exchange meeting for photosensitive materials held in Shantou, Guangdong, the "Dongfanghong" brand 120 film, black and white and color movie film were recognized as reaching the first-class level in the country due to their good sensitivity, low fog, and good use effect, after on-site quality inspection.
    Now, the factory produces sixteen kinds of products and has pioneered the production of medical X-ray film, with the quality also reaching advanced levels. (Ji)

    “东方红”胶片放异彩
    根据作家梁斌名著“红旗谱”改编的一部同名彩色影片，最近就要在北京电影制片厂制成。拍摄这部影片所用的彩色电影胶片，就是天津感光胶片厂生产的“东方红”牌产品。
    这个厂在1956年还是一个被人们称为“工人少、设备少、产品少”的“三少”工厂。那时，全厂只有一部小机器，只能生产照相用的玻璃干板和晒相纸。仅仅经过三年多的时间，这个厂就成为我国新兴感光器材工业中的一支主力军了。不久以前，在广东汕头举行的一次全国感光器材技术经验交流会上，“东方红”牌的一二零胶卷、黑白和彩色电影胶片由于感光度好，灰雾小，使用效果好，经过现场质量检验，公认为达到了全国第一流的水平。
    现在，这个厂生产的产品已经达到十六种，并且首创了医疗用爱克斯光胶片，质量也达到了先进水平。　　　（冀）
