Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangsu Province's summer grain harvest is basically complete, and various regions are launching a re-collection and re-threshing campaign.

This year, due to the increase in threshing machines, the progress of threshing summer crops has been faster and the quality has been higher. By the end of June, all rapeseed in the province had been threshed, and 92% of barley, wheat, and buckwheat had also been threshed. In order to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary and a bumper harvest is achieved, all localities are actively organizing re-collection and re-threshing. Nantong County organized more than 110,000 members of "Ten Cleans" professional teams, re-collecting from 100,000 mu of land and more than 9,900 threshing grounds, recovering an average of 18 jin of wheat per mu. Xuzhou Prefecture has also recovered more than 15 million jin of wheat through re-collection and re-threshing. Chenshi Commune in Lianshui County re-threshed over 10,800 mu of wheat, yielding more than 34,000 jin of grain.

At the beginning of the re-collection and re-threshing campaign, Party committees in various localities adopted the method of comparing and calculating detailed accounts to conduct ideological education among commune members, so that the re-collection and re-threshing work could be rapidly carried out. In Taizhou County, the wheat straw of all threshing grounds is being re-threshed, the *mai wen zi* (wheat husks that drift downwind during winnowing) are being re-winnowed, and the wheat grains on the threshing grounds are being picked clean, ensuring that the wheat straw is clean, the *wen zi* are clean, and the threshing grounds are clean. In Jiangyin County, most of the already threshed wheat has been re-threshed once. Now, inspection teams composed of cadres and commune member representatives are reviewing the already threshed wheat, team by team, ground by ground, stack by stack, and bundle by bundle.

    江苏三麦收获基本结束
    各地开展复收复打运动
    据新华社讯　江苏省麦收基本结束，各地正在展开复收复打运动。
    今年由于脱粒机增加，夏收作物的脱粒进度较快，质量也较高。到6月底止，全省油菜已全部脱粒完毕，大麦、小麦、元麦也已脱粒92％。各地为了认真做到颗粒归仓，丰产丰收，都在积极组织复收复打。南通县组织“十清”专业队十一万多人，复收了十万亩，九千九百多块场地，平均每亩收回麦子十八斤。徐州专区经过复收复打，也已收回麦子一千五百多万斤。涟水县陈师公社复打麦子一万零八百多亩，复打出粮食三万四千多斤。
    复收复打开始时，各地党委都采用对比算细账的方法，对社员进行思想教育，使复收复打工作迅速地开展起来。泰州县所有场头的麦草都正在复打，麦稳子（扬麦时飘在下风的麦壳子）复扬，场头上的麦粒拣净，做到麦秸清，稳子清，场地清。江阴县已经脱粒的麦子，大部分都复打过一次，现在又由干部和社员代表组成检查小组，对已脱粒的麦子都逐队、逐场、逐垛、逐捆地过堂。
