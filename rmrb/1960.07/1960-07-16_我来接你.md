　　I'll Pick You Up
　　This was the first sultry day since the start of summer. At noon, there wasn't a single cloud in the sky. After finishing the discharge procedures, Xiao Zhang found that all the tricycle rickshaws at the parking station were carrying passengers. He was about to carry his luggage back when a middle-aged woman he didn't know walked towards him, greeting him warmly, "Comrade Xiao Zhang, I'm here to help you with your luggage. I've been waiting for you here for quite a while." Xiao Zhang was stunned. The woman continued before Xiao Zhang could speak:
　　"Aren't you Zhang Ruowen from the single dormitory of the Shenyang Rubber Company? The comrades said you've just recovered from your illness and are being discharged today, so I came here specially to pick you up." "Pick me up?" Xiao Zhang asked in surprise. "Yes, here to pick you up." As she said this, she took Zhang Ruowen's luggage. Xiao Zhang wanted to ask what was going on several times, but he felt embarrassed to ask since someone was kindly helping him on such a hot day. He asked several times to take turns carrying the luggage himself, but she refused.
　　Back at the dormitory, Xiao Zhang saw the woman covered in sweat and felt truly moved and uneasy.
　　He couldn't help but ask, "Comrade, what is your name, and how did you know I was being discharged today?" She said, "My surname is Zhao, and my name is Zhao Qingzhi. I'm a service worker in your dormitory." It turned out that two days earlier, the comrades mentioned that Xiao Zhang would be discharged today, and they were all very happy. But everyone was working day shifts and couldn't spare the time to pick him up. The service worker Zhao Qingzhi, who was cleaning the rooms, overheard this. She expressed her willingness to pick up Xiao Zhang. But the comrades were afraid she wouldn't recognize Xiao Zhang. Suddenly, Zhao Qingzhi pointed to the photo on Xiao Zhang's bedside and asked everyone if it was Xiao Zhang. Everyone said in unison, "That's right, Sister Zhao really has a way"…
　　After listening to Sister Zhao's explanation, Zhang Ruowen couldn't help but say with sincere gratitude, "Thank you, Sister Zhao."

　　我来接你
    这是入夏以来的第一个闷热天。中午，天上一丝云彩也没有，小张办理完了出院手续，发现停车站的三轮车都运客去了。他正打算扛着行李往回走，忽然有一位陌生的中年妇女迎面朝他走来，热情地向他打招呼：“小张同志，我是来帮您拿行李的，在这儿等您半天了。”小张楞住了。这位大姐不等小张开口就接着说：
  “您是不是住在沈阳橡胶公司独身宿舍的张若文？同志们说你病刚好，今天要出院，我特地赶来接您的。”“接我？”小张吃惊地问。“是呀，接您来啦。”说着她接过了张若文的行李来。小张几次想问个究竟，但别人在这样大热天好心帮助，使他不好意思问下去。他几次要求自己替换着拿行李，也被拒绝了。
    回到宿舍后，小张看到这位汗流满面的大姐，真是感动和不安。
    他忍不住问：“同志，您贵姓，怎么知道我今天出院呢？”她说：“我姓赵，叫赵清芝，是你们宿舍的服务员。”原来，还在两天以前，同志们提到小张今天要出院，都很高兴。但大家都是白班工作的，无法抽空去接他。这件事被正在收拾房间的服务员赵清芝知道了。她表示愿意去接小张。可是同志们怕她不认识小张。忽然，赵清芝指着小张床头的照片问大家是不是小张，大家不约而同地说：“对，赵姐真有办法”……
    张若文听了赵姐叙说后，不由得衷心感激地说：“谢谢您，赵大姐。”
