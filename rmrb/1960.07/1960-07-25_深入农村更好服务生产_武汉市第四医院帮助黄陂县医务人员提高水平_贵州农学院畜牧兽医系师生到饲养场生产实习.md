    (Our report) Wuhan Fourth Hospital adopted the method of "fixed pairing" and "large leading small" to provide comprehensive technical assistance to Huangpi County People's Hospital, rapidly improving the medical level of the county hospital. The county hospital then used the same method to help commune health centers, and commune health centers in turn helped management district health stations, greatly improving the overall health care level in the county.
    In recent years, the medical technology level of Huangpi County People's Hospital has improved somewhat, but it has always been unable to keep up with the needs of the masses. After learning about this situation, Wuhan Fourth Hospital took the initiative to establish a support contract with the county hospital, with the Fourth Hospital providing long-term technical assistance to them. The main method of assistance is that both parties would select a principal medical staff member from outpatient, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, ophthalmology, and wards to participate in half a year of clinical work at the other's hospital. Medical personnel from the county hospital went to the Fourth Hospital to work and study under the guidance of attending physicians, using a package-teaching method, explaining theoretical knowledge and imparting clinical experience from simple to complex and from shallow to deep, according to the teaching plan, closely integrating theoretical teaching with clinical practice. After learning a technique, the trainee would first watch the master perform it, then the trainee would assist the master in treatment, and finally the trainee would work independently, with the master providing guidance, repeating this cycle until all the techniques were taught, enabling the trainee to work independently. The medical personnel sent by the Fourth Hospital provided guidance in the county hospital's outpatient, nursing, and clinical work, helped the county hospital establish various effective systems, helped medical personnel improve their skills, and held medical advanced training classes, systematically explaining anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology, while also assisting the county hospital in running eight intermediate-level classes, universally training and improving the medical staff of the communes. In the year or so from April of last year to the present, the Fourth Hospital has trained a group of medically skilled medical personnel for Huangpi County People's Hospital. The improvement in the county hospital's technical level has greatly facilitated the masses and better served production. In the past, whenever major illnesses were encountered, they often had to be transferred to Wuhan because the county hospital could not treat them, but this phenomenon has now been basically eliminated. According to statistics, from April to the end of 1958, more than 200 people were transferred to Wuhan for treatment. The situation changed greatly after the pairing, from April 1959 to the end of June this year, of the 837 patients treated in the county hospital, 367 cases were beyond the treatment capacity of the medical level before the pairing, now, except for 10 seriously ill patients transferred to Wuhan, 97% of the patients were treated locally.

    The improvement of the county hospital's level has initially formed a guidance center for rural medical and health undertakings, enabling them to have more energy and knowledge to help the vast rural health teams. Commune health centers used to only be able to treat minor injuries and illnesses, but now they can generally master more than 20 types of small and medium-sized operations, such as the treatment of bromhidrosis, great saphenous vein ligation, and vasectomy, and some can also correctly diagnose and treat relatively complex diseases such as appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, and gastric perforation. Last year, Luohansi Commune Health Center admitted 310 patients for hospitalization, and with the previous level of treatment, only 70 people could be cured, while now all 310 people have been cured in the health center. After the medical level of the commune health centers improved, they further trained more than 2,000 health workers, midwives, and cooks from management districts and production teams, making them the backbone of the vast masses in promoting hygiene and eliminating pests and diseases. The result of the county's health organizations grasping the transmission and improvement at all levels from top to bottom is that a new situation of "major illnesses not leaving the county and minor illnesses not leaving the commune" has been initially realized in Huangpi County.

    (Our report) Teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of Guizhou Agricultural College adopted the method of pairing and collaborating with commune breeding farms to carry out production internships, and achieved remarkable results: supporting agricultural technology transformation; improving teaching quality; promoting scientific research; and promoting teaching reform.

    In April of this year, the teachers and students of the third grade of this department, according to the call of the college's Party committee to "actively pair and collaborate with communes, support the great leap forward in agricultural production, and cultivate more agricultural technicians for the communes," decided to advance the time for the end-of-term production internship and combine it with the task of supporting agricultural technology transformation. They paired up with the nearby Huaxi Commune on one hand, and concentrated on studying some of the latest scientific achievements on the other. After nearly a month of production internship, the teachers and students helped the commune expand a pig farm, a dairy farm, and a chicken farm each, and also built a new mechanized automatic pig farm. At the same time, in in-depth investigation, research, exploration, and practice, the teachers and students also experimented and created a variety of new breeding and management methods, feed cultivation and production methods, and animal disease prevention and treatment methods, and wrote more than 120 special papers, greatly enriching the content of teaching, scientific research, and teaching reform.

    This kind of concentrated, comprehensive, and complete production internship was the first time for the teachers and students of this department. Under the leadership of the department's Party general branch, the teachers and students decided to re-formulate the research plan with the problems that urgently need to be solved by the breeding farms as the goal. In addition to assisting the breeding farms in formulating detailed production plans, the teachers and students actively carried out the cultivation and trial production of Chlorella antibiotics, calcium yeast feed, etc., carried out scientific research such as rapid pig fattening, multi-fetal and multi-birth, and used various new scientific and technological methods to treat pig asthma, piglet white diarrhea, chick white diarrhea, etc. Whenever they succeeded in an experiment, they immediately passed it on. They trained a group of Chlorella cultivators, improved seed breeders, and veterinarians for the commune. With the enthusiastic assistance of the teachers and students, the newly built Chlorella breeding pond of the Jianshan Pig Farm has begun to produce the original solution, the Datang Chicken Farm has the prototype of a modern chicken farm, and the Dongjiayan Mechanized Automatic Pig Farm has been completed and has begun to raise pigs in large quantities.

    深入农村更好服务生产
    武汉市第四医院帮助黄陂县医务人员提高水平
    贵州农学院畜牧兽医系师生到饲养场生产实习
    本报讯　武汉市第四医院采用“固定挂钩”“以大带小”的办法，对黄陂县人民医院进行全面的技术援助，迅速提高了县医院的医疗水平。县医院又采用同样办法帮助公社卫生院，公社卫生院再帮助管理区卫生所，这样大大提高了全县卫生医疗水平。
    几年来，黄陂县人民医院的医疗技术水平有所提高，但始终跟不上群众的需要。武汉第四医院了解到这种情况后，便主动上门同县医院订立了支援合同，由第四医院对他们进行长期的技术援助。援助的主要办法是，双方从门诊、内科、外科、妇产科、儿科、眼科到病房，各抽一个主要医护人员参加对方半年临床工作。县医院医务人员到第四医院跟班工作跟班学习，由主治医生带徒弟，采用包教包学的办法，按照教学计划，由简到繁、由浅入深地讲解理论知识和传授临床经验，通过边作边教边学，把理论教学和临床实习紧密结合起来。每学完一项技术，先让徒弟看师傅作，然后徒弟协助师傅进行治疗，最后由徒弟单独工作，师傅在一旁指导，如此反复循环，直到把各种技术传授完毕，使徒弟能独立工作。第四医院派下去的医务人员，在参加县医院的门诊、护理、临床等工作中进行辅导，帮助县医院订立各种有效的制度，帮助医务人员提高技术，并举办医药进修班，系统讲解解剖学、生理学和药理学，同时协助县医院办了八个中级班，普遍培训提高公社的医护人员。从去年4月到现在一年多的时间里，第四医院为黄陂县人民医院培训了一批业务比较成熟的医护人员。县医院技术水平的提高，大大方便了群众，更好地服务于生产。过去，每逢遇到重大病症，往往由于县医院不能治疗，不得不向武汉转送，现在基本消除了这种现象。据统计，从1958年4月到年底有二百多人转到武汉去治病。挂钩后的情况发生了很大变化，从1959年4月到今年6月底止，在县医院治疗的八百三十七个病人中，有三百六十七个病例是挂钩前的医疗水平所不能治疗的，现在，除了十个严重病人转到武汉外，其余有97％的病人都就地治好了。
    县医院水平的提高，初步形成为农村医药卫生事业的指导中心，使他们有了更多的精力和知识去帮助广大农村卫生队伍。公社卫生院过去只能治些小伤小病，现在一般都能掌握割治狐臭、大隐静脉结扎、输精管结扎等二十多种中小型手术，有的还能正确诊断并医治阑尾炎、肠梗阻、胃穿孔等比较复杂的病症。罗汉寺公社卫生院去年先后收治了三百一十个病人住院，用过去的水平只能治愈七十人，而现在三百一十人都在本卫生院治好了。公社卫生院医疗水平提高后，又进一步培训管理区、生产队的二千多卫生员、接生员和炊事员，使他们成为广大群众讲卫生、除害灭病的骨干。全县卫生组织从上到下层层抓传授、层层抓提高的结果，在黄陂县境内就初步实现了“大病不出县，小病不出社”的新局面。
    本报讯　贵州农学院畜牧兽医系三年级师生，采取和公社饲养场挂钩协作的办法，进行生产实习，收到了显著的效果：支援了农业技术改造；提高了教学质量；促进了科学研究；推动了教学改革。
    今年4月，这个系三年级的师生根据学院党委提出的“积极与公社挂钩协作，支援农业生产大跃进，为公社培养更多的农业技术人员”的号召，决定把期末的生产实习时间提前，和支援农业技术改造的任务结合起来进行。他们一面同附近的花溪公社挂钩；一面集中学习了一些最新科学成就。经过将近一个月的生产实习，师生们帮助公社扩建了养猪场、奶牛场、养鸡场各一个，还新建了一个机械化自动线的养猪场。同时，在深入的调查、研究、摸索、实践中，师生们还试验和创造了多种新的饲养、管理方法，饲料栽培和制作方法，兽病预防和治疗方法，写出专题论文一百二十多篇，大大丰富了教学、科学研究和教学改革内容。
    这样集中地、全面地、完整地进行生产实习，对这个系的师生来说还是第一次。在系党总支的领导下，师生们决定以各饲养场亟待解决的问题为目标，重新拟订了研究计划。师生们除协助各饲养场制订了详细的生产规划外，并积极进行了小球藻抗菌素、钙酵母饲料等的培养和试制，开展了猪的快速育肥、多胎多产等科学研究，同时运用各种新的科学技术治疗猪喘气病、仔猪白痢、雏鸡白痢等。每当他们试验成功一样就立即传授。他们为公社培养了一批小球藻培养员、良种配种员和兽医人员。在师生们的热情协助下，尖山养猪场新建的小球藻繁殖池已开始生产原液，大塘养鸡场已具备了现代养鸡场的雏形，董家堰机械化自动线养猪场已经建成，并已开始大批养猪。
