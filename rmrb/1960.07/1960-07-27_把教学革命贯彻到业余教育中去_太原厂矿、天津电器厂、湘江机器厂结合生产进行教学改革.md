Carry Out Teaching Revolution in Spare-Time Education
Taiyuan Factories and Mines, Tianjin Electric Appliance Factory, Xiangjiang Machine Factory Combine Production with Teaching Reform

(Reported by this newspaper) In the upsurge of the nationwide technical revolution, Taiyuan City has witnessed a new high tide of vigorously developing vocational spare-time education for workers. At present, while popularizing primary and secondary education, higher spare-time education has made rapid progress. The number of workers participating in spare-time university studies has surged from 3,600 at the beginning of this year to 10,000. Combining theory with production, they are vigorously engaging in teaching revolution and scientific research activities, accelerating the training of intellectuals from the working class.

In the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, factories and mining enterprises in Taiyuan City formed a mass movement for running spare-time education. Especially since the beginning of this year, in the technical revolution with "four modernizations" as its content, the desire of the working masses to improve their scientific and cultural knowledge has become even more urgent. At present, the practice of learning is prevalent among the workers. By the end of May this year, 220,000 young and middle-aged workers, accounting for 80.3% of the total number of workers, were participating in various levels and types of schools. Now, except for a few construction departments and coal mines, primary education has been popularized in the rest, and some factories and mines have popularized secondary education. Many enterprises have also established a spare-time teaching system from primary education to higher education.

On the basis of the great development and popularization of vocational spare-time education, a new upsurge of vigorously developing spare-time higher education has recently emerged.

In the process of vigorously developing vocational spare-time schools, Taiyuan City launched the masses to vigorously carry out teaching revolution. For example, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and other factories carried out mass debate, vehemently destroying bourgeois educational thinking, and making bold innovations in curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, and teaching aids. On the basis of a great revolution in teachers' ideology, these units, under the command of Marxist-Leninist educational thought and with the research and summary of the latest scientific and technological achievements as the key, cooperated with leaders, teachers, and students to compile six outlines and fifty-four kinds of textbooks for language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and technical processes. The university curriculum, based on the characteristics of veteran workers' rich production knowledge and lack of theoretical knowledge, was simplified from thirty-three courses to fourteen, breaking the old system of four courses: theoretical mechanics, material mechanics, machine principles, and machine parts, and establishing two courses: engineering mechanics and design foundation. This fundamentally changed the phenomena of mutual separation and duplication. At the same time, a teaching aid reform movement centered on audio-visual teaching was vigorously launched. With the reform of teaching materials and teaching aids, not only was the quality of teaching guaranteed, but also the length of study was appropriately shortened. Now, various factories and mines have initially determined a new school system.

(Reported by this newspaper) Guided by the idea of "taking production as the key link," the vocational spare-time education work of the state-owned Tianjin Electric Appliance Factory has been conscientiously carrying out teaching reform, rapidly training a group of technical talents.

Guided by the idea of "taking production as the key link," this factory carried out teaching reform from November 1958, changing the original school system of vocational spare-time education for primary, secondary, and universities, and establishing a high-level and intermediate-level school system or a consistent system with a major in a specific field. According to the characteristics of veteran workers, workers below the second grade, young apprentices, intermediate technicians, and leading cadres, six kinds of learning organizations with different study years and teaching contents were established. At the same time, according to the characteristics of production workers' specialized trades, the principles of "taking production as the key link, starting from the actual situation of workers, using professional courses to lead basic courses, and comprehensively utilizing knowledge of various scientific disciplines" were determined, and teaching outlines and materials were compiled. They first broke the old teaching method and changed it to learning professional courses first, and then arranging general courses and technical basic courses according to the needs of the professional courses. It was done so that workers would read professional courses, and whatever basic knowledge was needed as a supplement, the teaching materials would carry that basic knowledge, using it early, using it late, not using it, not carrying it, starting from easy and gradually increasing the difficulty. Some technological knowledge related to technical basic courses that workers were familiar with would not be taught or taught less. After the new technologies and techniques created by workers were listed as professional courses, ordinary courses and technical basic courses were correspondingly coordinated. Some professional knowledge involved many aspects of basic knowledge, so the basic knowledge was explained with emphasis according to production needs.

The teachers of the factory's spare-time school reformed their teaching methods according to the law of cognition of "practice—recognition—practice." By participating in production and going deep into the working masses, they understood production knowledge and the characteristics of workers. When lecturing, they used the actual knowledge that workers were familiar with as the starting point, introduced the topics and formulas and theorems to be lectured, and then returned to the actual production to guide workers to study and solve practical problems. Teachers also used the method of lecturing, practicing, and using at the same time, which was very effective.

(Reported by this newspaper) Hunan Xiangjiang Machine Factory closely integrated cultural revolution and technical revolution, vigorously developed vocational spare-time education, trained a large number of technical forces, and rapidly improved the political, cultural, and technical level of workers.

The factory implemented the "two-pronged approach" (factories running schools and workshops and departments running schools at the same time, professional education and universal education at the same time) and "five combinations" (combining production, education, and scientific research; combining politics, culture, and technology; combining key training and universal improvement; combining current production needs and long-term systematic improvement; combining theory and practice) "walking on two legs" school-running principle, so that the entire factory has formed a complete spare-time education system from elementary school to university. At present, the factory has one spare-time university, twenty-two red and expert schools, with a total of one hundred and seventy-six classes; it has also established a "Marxist-Leninist Research Institute" and seven spare-time design research institutes. Due to the persistence of spare-time education, the cultural outlook of the workers has undergone fundamental changes. Due to the continuous improvement of the political, cultural, and technical level of the workers, not only has the factory's need for technical strength been basically met, but it has also supported the construction of new factories. At the same time, due to the high tide of the cultural revolution and the continuous growth of technical forces, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been greatly promoted, which has powerfully promoted production.

One of the important experiences of this factory in achieving remarkable results in vocational spare-time education is that the factory's party committee and the party branches of various workshops and departments have conscientiously strengthened their leadership over spare-time education. The factory's party committee established a cultural and educational leading group, which was led by a deputy secretary of the party committee. The party, government, labor union, and youth league all have special institutions or full-time cadres, taking production as the center, grasping production with one hand and education with the other. The party committee effectively guaranteed the workers' spare-time study time, and the enrollment rate of all factory workers reached 99.07% of the number of people who should be enrolled, and the average attendance rate reached 83.9%.

Vigorously carrying out teaching reform, closely combining teaching with the current production movement, shortening teaching time, and training technical revolution talents at high speed is also an important reason why this factory has achieved remarkable results in vigorously developing spare-time education. According to the phenomena of fewer, slower, poorer, and more expensive that existed in past worker education, the factory party committee organized teachers to deeply study the party's education policy, unified teachers' thinking, vigorously carried out education revolution, reformed the old school system and teaching materials, established a new education system, and proposed some principles of worker education. For example, veteran workers should focus on improving professional technical theory, and cultural basic courses should be supplemented according to actual needs. The special class for veteran workers run by the factory adopted the method of organizing veteran workers into five professional classes such as machine tool manufacturing and casting. While carrying out systematic study of technical theory, they also closely combined it with the current "double innovation" and "four modernizations" movement for special research. Through three years of spare-time study, they generally improved from primary school to secondary specialized school graduation level. The factory also adopted the method of combining teachers, workers, and technicians under the leadership of the party committee. Through vigorously carrying out mass movements, it compiled a set of cultural and technical course teaching materials from elementary school to university. This set of teaching materials closely combined with the current production needs and also took into account the principles of long-term systematic improvement. Some impractical, repetitive, and outdated content was deleted, greatly shortening the study years, reducing the original seventeen years required from elementary school to university to ten years (six years for primary and secondary schools, four years for university), but the level has been generally improved.

    把教学革命贯彻到业余教育中去
    太原厂矿、天津电器厂、湘江机器厂结合生产进行教学改革
    本报讯　太原市在全民性的技术革命洪流中，出现了大办职工业余教育的新高潮。目前，全市在普及初等、中等教育的同时，高等业余教育有了突飞猛进的发展。参加业余大学学习的工人由今年年初的三千六百人猛增到一万人。他们结合生产，大搞教学革命和科学研究活动，加速培养工人阶级的知识分子。
    在1958、1959两年多的连续大跃进中，太原市各厂矿企业形成了全民办业余教育的运动。特别是今年以来，在以“四化”为内容的技术革命中，工人群众要求提高科学文化的欲望更加迫切。目前，职工群众学习成风，到今年5月底，参加各级、各类学校学习的青壮年职工达二十二万人，占职工总数的80.3％。现在，除少数建筑部门和煤矿外，其余都普及了初等教育，一部分厂矿已普及了中等教育。还有不少企业建立了从初等教育到高等教育的业余教学体系。
    在职工业余教育大发展、大普及的基础上，最近又出现了大办业余高等教育的新高潮。
    太原市在大办职工业余学校的过程中，发动群众大搞教学革命，如太原钢铁公司、山西机床厂、太原矿山机器厂等厂开展了群众性的鸣放辩论，大破资产阶级教育思想，在课程、教材、教法、教具等方面都作了大胆的革新。这些单位在教师思想大革命的基础上，以马克思列宁主义的教育思想为统帅，研究总结最新科学技术成就为纲，由领导、教师、学员互相协作，编出六种大纲和五十四种语文、数学、理化和技术工艺教材。大学课程根据老工人生产知识丰富、理论欠缺的特点，由三十三门简为十四门，打破了理论力学、材料力学、机械原理和机械零件等四门课程的旧体系，建立了工程力学和设计基础两门课程。这样就使原来互相隔裂、互相重复的现象，得到根本的改变。与此同时，一个以电化教学为中心内容的教具改革运动也蓬勃开展起来。随着教材、教具的改革，既保证了教学质量，又适当缩短了学习年限。现在，各厂矿已初步确定了新的学制。
    本报讯　国营天津电器厂的职工业余教育工作，在“以生产为纲”的思想指导下，认真地进行教学改革，迅速地培养出一批技术人材。
    这个工厂在“以生产为纲”的思想指导下，从1958年11月起进行教学改革，改变原来职工业余教育的大、中、小学学制，建立了以专业为主的高级、中级学制或一贯制。按照老工人、二级以下工人、青年徒工、中级技术人员和领导干部的特点，建立了六种学习年限、教学内容各不相同的学习组织。同时，根据生产工人工种专业化的特点，确定了“以生产为纲，从工人实际出发，以专业课带基础课，综合利用各门科学知识”的原则，编写教学大纲和教材。他们首先打破了旧的教学方法，改为先学专业课，然后根据专业课的需要，安排普通课和技术基础课。做到了工人读专业课，需要什么基础知识作补充，教材就带什么基础知识，早用早带、晚用晚带、不用不带、先易后难、步步提高。有些为工人所熟知的涉及到技术基础课的工艺知识，就不讲或少讲。工人创造的新工艺和新技术列为专业课后，也相应地配合了普通课和技术基础课。有些专业知识涉及多方面的基础知识，就根据生产需要，有重点地讲解基础知识。
    这个厂业余学校的教师按照“实践——认识——实践”的认识规律改革教学方法。他们通过参加生产、深入工人群众，了解了生产知识和工人的特点，讲课时，便以工人熟知的实际知识为起点，引出所要讲的课题和公式、定理，然后再回到生产实际，引导工人研究和解决实际问题。教师还用边讲、边练、边用的方式讲课，收效很大。
    本报讯　湖南湘江机器厂把文化革命和技术革命紧密结合起来，大办职工业余教育，培训了大批技术力量，职工政治、文化、技术水平都得到了迅速提高。
    这个厂实行“两并举”（工厂办学与车间、科室办学并举，专业教育与普遍教育并举）、“五结合”（生产、教育、科研相结合；政治、文化、技术相结合；重点培养与普遍提高相结合；当前生产需要与长远系统提高相结合；理论与实际相结合）的“两条腿走路”办学原则，使全厂已经形成从小学到大学的完整的业余教育体系。目前，全厂有业余大学一所，红专学校二十二所，共有一百七十六个班；还建立了一个“马列主义研究院”、七个业余设计研究所。由于坚持了业余教育，职工文化面貌发生了根本变化，由于职工政治、文化、技术水平的不断提高，不仅基本满足了本厂技术力量的需要，而且支援了新厂的建设。同时，由于文化革命高潮和技术力量的不断增长，大大促进了技术革新和技术革命运动，有力地推动了生产。
    这个厂在职工业余教育上取得显著成绩的重要经验之一，就是工厂党委、各车间、科室党支部认真加强了对业余教育工作的领导。工厂党委成立了文教领导小组，由一个党委副书记负责领导，党、政、工、团都设有专门机构或专职干部，以生产为中心，一手抓生产，一手抓教育。党委切实保证了职工业余学习时间，全厂职工入学率达到了应入学人数的99.07％，平均出勤率达到83.9％。
    大搞教学改革，把教学和当前生产运动紧密结合起来，缩短教学时间，高速度地培养技术革命人材，也是这个厂大办业余教育取得显著成绩的重要原因。工厂党委根据过去职工教育中存在的少慢差费现象，组织教师深入学习党的教育方针，统一教师思想，大搞教育革命，改革旧的学制和教材，建立新的教育体系，并且提出了职工教育的一些原则，如老工人以提高专业技术理论为主，文化基础课按实际需要，缺什么就补什么。工厂办的老工人特别班，就是采取把老工人组成机床制造、铸型等五个专业班，在进行系统学习技术理论为主的同时，紧密结合当前“双革”、“四化”运动进行专题研究，通过三年业余学习，使他们普遍由小学提高到中专毕业水平。这个工厂还采取了在党委领导下的教师、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，通过大搞群众运动，编写了一套从小学到大学的文化技术课教材，这套教材既紧密地结合了当前生产需要，也照顾了长远的系统提高的原则，把过去一些脱离实际的、重复陈旧的删掉了，大大地缩短了学习年限，使原来由小学到大学需要十七年的时间减到十年（中小学六年，大学四年），程度却普遍提高了。
