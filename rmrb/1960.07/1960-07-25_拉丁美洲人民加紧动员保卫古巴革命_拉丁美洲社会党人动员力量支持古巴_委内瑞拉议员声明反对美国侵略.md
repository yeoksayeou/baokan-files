(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) The people of various Latin American countries continue to express their firm support for the just struggle of the Cuban people to defend their independence and sovereignty and oppose US imperialist aggression.

The Latin American Secretariat of the Socialist International held a press conference in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, on the evening of the 21st.

At the request of the Uruguayan Socialist Party, the Latin American Secretariat of the Socialist International decided to hold its fifth meeting of the Consultative Committee starting on the 22nd, with the aim of "making the measures of the Socialist Party and the people's parties of this continent to support the Cuban revolution concrete and effective."

Chilean Socialist Senator Ampuero Diaz said at the press conference that the purpose of holding the Consultative Committee meeting now is to "unify practical measures in order to more concretely demonstrate Latin America's support for Cuba" and to fulfill the resolution passed on the same subject at the fourth meeting held in La Paz, Bolivia in February 1960.

Diaz said: We propose to take action to stop the suppression of the Cuban revolution and prevent a recurrence of the Guatemalan events. He pointed out that the resistance on this continent may "force the imperialist aggression against Cuba to retreat."

Diaz also said that Chilean labor organizations have announced that if the United States launches an open aggression against Cuba, Chilean workers will hold strikes, refuse to load and unload goods for ships flying the American flag, and even take direct action to send volunteers to stop the strangulation of the Cuban revolution.

Ramon Muniz, General Secretary of the Argentine Socialist Party, emphasized that the Argentine working class and people support the Cuban revolution.

Parliamentarians from the Democratic Republican Union, the Left-wing Revolutionary Movement, and the Communist Party of Venezuela have formed a committee to more broadly promote activities in support of the Cuban revolution.

The sixty-six parliamentarians participating in the committee issued a statement saying: "We oppose imperialist aggression against Cuba, which is manifested in violating Cuban airspace, imposing an economic blockade on Cuba, and attempting to organize a front of American countries to deal with Marti's homeland."

The statement pointed out that the US imperialists are attempting to make the governments of Latin American countries adopt a position of colluding with foreign economic interest groups, which are instigating aggression against Cuba with the support of the United States.

The statement called on the Venezuelan government to take actions that are in line with the profound feelings of the Venezuelan people in support of the Cuban revolution, and called on parliamentarians from Latin American countries to actively and vigilantly defend the Cuban revolution in order to defeat all anti-Cuban conspiracies planned inside and outside the Organization of American States.

The statement was signed by: Jose Medina Sanchez, Vice President of the Venezuelan Senate, Luis Alfredo Lopez Mendes, Vice President of the House of Representatives, Jose Herrera Oropesa, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, and parliamentarians from both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The Cuban "Revolution" newspaper reported on the 23rd that Senator Lorazo Pinero Rivera of the Puerto Rican Independence Party said here when he met with reporters that "in Puerto Rico, with the approval of the US government, attempts are being made to recruit veterans of the Korean War to attack Cuba."

Pinero came to Cuba with some Puerto Ricans to participate in the celebration of the July 26th Revolutionary Movement Day.

Pinero condemned the "barbaric propaganda campaign" conducted by the American colonialists against the Cuban revolution. Recently, the distribution of the Cuban "Revolution" newspaper has been banned in Puerto Rico.

Pinero emphasized that despite the anti-Cuban slander campaign, the Puerto Rican people still support the Cuban revolution. The "New Friends of Cuba Association" has launched activities to defend Cuba throughout Puerto Rico. This association is composed of some prestigious people from Puerto Rico.

The municipal authorities of Valparaiso, the main port and second largest city of Chile with a population of 300,000, sent a telegram to the Cuban revolutionary government on the eve of the Cuban July 26th Revolutionary Movement Day, expressing congratulations on the festival and support for the Cuban revolution.

The telegram said that the Cuban revolution has gained the support and respect of millions of Latin Americans who aspire to dignity, prosperity and the exercise of their sovereignty. The telegram condemned the imperialist conspiracy to further interfere in Cuba and the economic pressure exerted on Cuba by foreign corporations.

Columnist Jose Cueto published a commentary in "Siglo" entitled "The Hoax of the Monroe Doctrine," saying that the Monroe Doctrine is clearly a doctrine of imperialism. It violates the principle of respecting national sovereignty, and therefore, it has no binding force on anyone.

The commentary pointed out that it was the United States itself that carried out aggressions against Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia. It said, "The Monroe Doctrine has most badly harmed the sovereignty and self-determination of our countries."

The Left-wing Union of Chilean University Students passed a resolution strongly supporting the Cuban revolutionary government. The resolution condemned "the blatant imperialist attitude of the US government." The resolution said that the only thing that endangers peace in the Caribbean region is those who slander Cuba.

Brazilian public opinion has expressed support for the Cuban revolution and opposition to the United States' intensified interference in Cuba.

The Brazilian "New Orientation" weekly pointed out in its latest issue that the true face of imperialism is ferocious and hateful, and it needs to rely on masks, and it is still trying to hide its true nature of living by exploiting the working class and the people of all countries. The weekly also said that the United States has exhausted all its tricks, attempting to justify its intervention in Cuba, and even accusing Cuba of aggression against the United States. However, all of this cannot cover up the truth.

The weekly said that when the United States actually hopes to regain control of Cuba and prevent Cuba from developing an independent economy, the United States cannot talk about the unity of the Americas. The weekly pointed out that the unity between the people of Latin American countries means supporting each other in the struggle against foreign monopoly groups, not supporting the exploiters.

The weekly said that the Brazilian people are determined to achieve complete liberation of their politics and economy, and trade unions, student organizations and parliamentarians have openly stated their positions, because the Brazilian people see their own victory in the victory of the Cuban revolution.

The Brazilian Association of Democratic Legal Workers issued an appeal to lawyers in Latin American countries on the 22nd, calling on them to support Cuba.

The appeal said, referring to the decision of the Organization of American States, under the direction of the United States, to hold a meeting of foreign ministers of its member states: We still remember the role played by the Caracas meeting in preparing for intervention in Guatemala, which overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala and established a dictatorial regime serving the United Fruit Company of the United States. The appeal emphasized that it cannot be allowed to continue to use the Organization of American States as a tool of the American economic groups that exploit Latin America.

    拉丁美洲人民加紧动员保卫古巴革命
    拉丁美洲社会党人动员力量支持古巴　委内瑞拉议员声明反对美国侵略
    本报综合报道　拉丁美洲各国人民继续表示坚决支持古巴人民保卫独立主权、反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    社会党国际拉丁美洲书记处21日晚间在乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚举行了记者招待会。
    社会党国际拉丁美洲书记处在乌拉圭社会党的要求下，决定从22日起举行它的协商委员会的第五次会议，目的是“使本大陆社会党和各人民的党派支持古巴革命的措施具体和有效”。
    智利社会党参议员安普埃罗·迪亚斯在记者招待会上说，现在举行协商委员会会议的目的，是为了“使实际的措施一致，以便更具体地表明拉丁美洲对古巴的支持”，并且为了履行1960年2月在玻利维亚的拉巴斯举行的第四次会议上就同样内容通过的决议。
    迪亚斯说：我们建议采取行动，制止对古巴革命的镇压，制止重演危地马拉事件。他指出，本大陆的抵抗有可能“迫使帝国主义对古巴的侵略退却”。
    迪亚斯还说，智利的工人组织宣布，如果美国发动对古巴的公开侵略，智利工人将举行罢工，拒绝为悬挂美国旗帜的船只装卸货物，甚至采取派遣志愿人员来制止扼杀古巴革命的直接行动。
    阿根廷社会党总书记拉蒙·穆尼斯强调指出，阿根廷工人阶级和人民支持古巴革命。
    委内瑞拉共和民主联盟、左派革命运动和共产党的议员组成了一个委员会，以便更加广泛地推进支持古巴革命的活动。
    参加这个委员会的六十六位议员发表声明说：“我们反对帝国主义侵略古巴，这种侵略表现为侵犯古巴领空，对古巴进行经济封锁以及企图组织一条美洲国家阵线来对付马蒂的祖国。”
    声明指出，美帝国主义者正在企图使拉丁美洲国家的政府采取同外国经济利益集团同谋合作的立场，这些利益集团正在美国的支持下煽动侵略古巴。
    声明要求委内瑞拉政府采取符合委内瑞拉人民支援古巴革命的深厚感情的行动，并且呼吁拉丁美洲各国的议员积极而警惕地保卫古巴革命，以便击败在美洲国家组织内外策划的一切反古巴阴谋。
    签署这项声明的有：委内瑞拉参议院副议长何塞·梅迪纳·桑切斯、众议院副议长路易斯·阿尔弗雷多·洛佩斯·门德斯、众议院外交委员会主席何塞·埃雷拉·奥罗佩萨和参众两院的议员。
    古巴“革命报”23日报道，波多黎各独立党参议员洛化索·皮内罗·里维拉在这里接见记者时说，“在波多黎各，有人在美国政府的赞许下，正在企图招募朝鲜战争中的老兵来进攻古巴。”
    皮内罗是和一些波多黎各人士来古巴参加7月26日革命运动节的庆祝活动的。
    皮内罗谴责美国殖民者所进行的反对古巴革命的“野蛮宣传运动”。最近，已经禁止在波多黎各发行古巴“革命报”。
    皮内罗强调指出，尽管进行了反古巴的诽谤宣传运动，波多黎各人民还是支持古巴革命。“新古巴之友协会”在波多黎各全岛展开了保卫古巴的活动。这个协会是由波多黎各的一些有威信的人士组成的。
    拥有三十万人口的智利主要港口、第二大城瓦尔帕拉伊索市的市政机构在古巴7月26日革命运动节前夕致电古巴革命政府，表示祝贺节日和支持古巴革命。
    电报说，古巴革命已经取得拉丁美洲千百万人的支持和尊敬，他们渴望尊严、繁荣和行使自己的主权。电报谴责帝国主义进一步干涉古巴的阴谋和外国大公司对古巴施加的经济压力。
    专栏作家何塞·库埃托在“世纪报”上以“门罗主义的骗局”为题发表评论说，门罗主义显然是帝国主义的主义。它违反尊重国家主权的原则，因此，它对任何人没有约束力量。
    评论指出，对古巴、波多黎各、菲律宾、墨西哥、哥伦比亚进行了侵略的正是美国自己。它说，“门罗主义最恶劣地危害了我们这些国家的主权和自决权。”
    智利大学生左派联盟通过一项坚决支持古巴革命政府的决议。决议谴责“美国政府明目张胆的帝国主义态度”。决议说，唯一在加勒比海地区危害和平的正是那些诽谤古巴的人。
    巴西公众舆论纷纷表示支持古巴革命，反对美国加紧干涉古巴。
    巴西“新方针”周刊在最近一期中指出，帝国主义的真面目是凶恶的和可憎的，它需要依靠假面具，它仍旧在竭力隐藏它的靠剥削劳动阶级和各国人民过活的真实本性。周刊又说，美国用尽一切诡计，企图为它的干涉古巴的行动辩解，甚至还指责古巴侵略美国。但是，这一切掩盖不了事实真相。
    这家周刊说，当美国实际上希望重新统治古巴并阻止古巴发展独立经济时，美国就不能谈什么美洲的团结。周刊指出，拉丁美洲各国人民之间的团结，意味着在反对外国垄断集团的斗争中互相支持，而不是支持剥削者。
    周刊说，巴西人民决心使自己的政治和经济获得完全的解放，工会、学生组织和议员们已经公开地表明了它们的立场，因为巴西人民从古巴革命的胜利中看到了自己的胜利。
    巴西民主法律工作者协会22日向拉丁美洲各国的律师发出一项呼吁书，号召他们支持古巴。
    呼吁书在谈到美洲国家组织在美国指使下决定举行它的成员国外长会议时说：我们还记得为干涉危地马拉做了准备活动的加拉加斯会议所起的作用，当时推翻了危地马拉民主政府，建立了为美国联合果品公司效劳的独裁政权。呼吁书强调指出，不能允许继续把美洲国家组织当作剥削拉丁美洲的美国经济集团的工具。
