    Jiangxi Province is carrying out a tool reform movement of "three machines and one mechanization" (rice transplanters, harvesters, threshers, and vehicle mechanization) to welcome the early rice harvest and late rice transplanting. In less than a month, the province has repaired and manufactured more than 120,000 rice transplanters, more than 300,000 rapid harvesters, more than 130,000 threshers, and more than 900,000 vehicles for field transportation, and they are being continuously transported to communes and production teams for harvesting and planting.

    Vigorously grasping the semi-mechanization of transplanting, harvesting, threshing, and transporting is one of the important measures for Jiangxi Province to accelerate the realization of agricultural technological transformation. With the early rice harvest and late rice transplanting about to begin comprehensively, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the area for harvesting and transplanting is large, the task is heavy, and the time is tight. It is necessary to combine harvesting and transplanting to carry out a larger-scale semi-mechanization movement of planting, harvesting, threshing, and transporting tools, namely the "three machines and one mechanization" movement, to solve the shortage of rural labor and ensure the timely completion of harvesting and planting tasks.

    With the full-scale unfolding of the "three machines and one mechanization" movement, Party committee secretaries at all levels of the province, counties, and communes took command, and leading cadres of relevant departments were responsible for coordinating manpower and material resources, and quickly concentrated 100,000 staff and industrial workers to invest in manufacturing work. All localities focused on both quantity and quality to ensure that one machine is produced and one machine is used well.

    While grasping manufacturing and ensuring quality, the entire province from top to bottom has been vigorously promoting their use. The biggest feature of this year's "three machines and one mechanization" promotion work is that leading cadres take the lead. Starting from the provincial level, many leading cadres from relevant departments and mass organizations have recently taken the lead in going to the fields to learn how to use rice transplanters. County Party committee secretaries and commune Party committee secretaries are all vying to stand at the forefront of promoting the "three machines." Not only have they learned to operate them, but many cadres have also become skilled operators, setting an example for the masses and powerfully promoting the "three machines and one mechanization" movement. All localities have also particularly strengthened the organization and training of operator teams. Now, through training classes and field demonstrations, more than 200,000 operators have been trained in various places, and each has achieved "three understandings and three skills," namely: understanding principles, understanding structure, understanding performance; being able to use, being able to maintain, and being able to repair.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 16th. In the tool reform movement, Suixian County, Hubei Province, grasped reform on one hand and usage on the other, thus saving a total of 550,000 workdays during the summer harvest and summer planting.

    This year, Suixian County organized two large-scale tool reforms focusing on the key aspects of agricultural production, establishing 2,000 hydraulic and animal-powered processing equipment locations, and manufacturing a large number of rice transplanters, threshers, harvesters, deep plows, vehicles, etc. In these two movements, the county party committee focused on vehicles, processing tools, and rice transplanters, respectively, and conducted several major inspections, finding that only 72,000 out of 150,000 new vehicles were being used, and only a few hundred out of 4,000 to 5,000 rice transplanters were being used. The reasons for poor usage were: first, the masses were used to old tools and felt that the new tools were not easy to use; second, they didn't know how to use them; and third, they didn't know how to repair the new tools when they broke down. Based on the above situation, the county party committee resolutely implemented the spirit of the provincial and regional party committees' instructions to protect reform and ensure use, and educated certain cadres to correct the one-sided view of only valuing reform and not valuing use, so that cadres and the masses understood the purpose of reforming tools.

    In solving the problem of promoting the use of new tools, Suixian County particularly emphasized that secretaries should go deep into the fields and take the lead in using new tools. An Haitian, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally went to the fields in Xihe, Lishan, Tangzhen, and other places to operate rice transplanters, and found that one rice box for each machine was too few, and could not adequately supply seedlings, resulting in wasted work time. Comrade An Haitian immediately arranged for the entire county to rush to make rice boxes, so that each rice transplanter was additionally equipped with a spare rice box, thereby increasing work efficiency by more than double, and the commune members also liked to use them. Under the leadership of the first secretary, the secretaries of the county party committee also led working groups to the countryside to help various places solve specific problems in the promotion of new tools.

    In solving the problem of promoting the use of new tools, Suixian County tightly grasped the key link of rapidly cultivating technical forces, and generally adopted methods such as masters teaching apprentices and opening training classes to cultivate more than 17,000 technicians. They can both use and repair new tools, and therefore have become the backbone of promoting new tools. For example, the county concentrated more than 200 trainees for on-site operation and field lectures, so that they quickly mastered all the operating techniques of rice transplanters, and promptly sent them to various communes and management areas to run training classes to impart technology. In this way, each rice transplanter in the county had two rice transplanter operators. At the same time, the county party committee also emphasized the combination of grasping the reform of tools and creating conditions for use, the combination of reforming vehicles and repairing roads, the combination of reforming stone rollers and reforming threshing grounds, etc., which greatly improved the utilization rate of tools.

    In order to ensure the comprehensive, rapid, and decisive completion of the summer harvest and summer planting tasks, Xunwu County, Jiangxi Province, organized more than 200 factories throughout the county to vigorously produce new agricultural implements such as the "Jiangxi Five-Nine Type" rice transplanter, rapid harvester, and fertilizer applicator.

　　江西革新插秧收割脱粒运输工具
　　湖北随县在改革工具运动中大力抓使用推广
    据新华社南昌讯　江西省开展“三机一化”（插秧机、收割机、打谷机、车子化）的工具改革运动来迎接早稻收割和晚稻插秧。全省不到一个月已修理和制造插秧机十二万多部、快速收割机三十多万部、打谷机十三万多部、田间运输用的车子九十多万辆，并正源源运往公社和生产队投入收种。
    大抓插秧、收割、脱粒、运输半机械化，是江西省加速实现农业技术改造的重要措施之一。当前早稻收割和晚稻插秧即将全面开始，中共江西省委认为收、插的面积大、任务重、时间紧，必须结合收、插开展一个更大规模的栽、收、脱、运工具半机械化的运动，即“三机一化”运动，以解决农村劳动力的不足，保证按时完成收种任务。
    随着“三机一化”运动的全面展开，全省各地、县、公社党委书记挂帅，有关部门领导干部负责，统筹安排人力、物力，迅速集中了十万名职工和手工业工人投入制造工作。各地既抓数量又抓质量，确保出厂一部，用好一部。
    在抓制造、保质量的同时，全省从上到下狠抓推广。今年“三机一化”推广工作的最大特点是领导干部带头。从省一级开始，各有关部门和群众团体的许多领导干部，最近都带头下田学习使用插秧机。各县县委书记，公社党委书记更是个个争先，站在推广“三机”的最前线，不仅学会了操作，许多干部还成了操作能手，为群众树立起榜样，有力地推动了“三机一化”运动。各地还特别加强了操作手队伍的组织培训工作。现在各地通过训练班和田间现场演习，已训练操作手二十多万人，个个达到“三懂三会”，即：懂原理、懂结构、懂性能；会使用、会保养、会修理。
    本报武汉16日电　湖北随县在工具改革运动中，一手抓改革，一手抓使用，因此，在夏收夏种期间，共节约了五十五万个劳动日。
    今年，随县围绕农业生产的关键，组织了两次大规模的工具改革，共建立水力畜力加工设备二千处，制造了大量的插秧机、脱粒机、收割机、深耕犁、车子等。县委在这两次运动中，分别以车子、加工工具、插秧机为重点，进行了数次大检查，发现十五万部新车子只使用七万二千多部，四、五千部插秧机只使用了几百部。使用不好的原因，一是群众用惯了旧工具，嫌新工具不顺手；二是不会用；三是新工具坏了不会修。根据以上情况，县委坚决贯彻了省委、地委保改、保用的指示精神，教育某些干部改正了只重视改，不重视用的片面观点，使干部、群众认识改革工具的目的。
    在解决新工具的推广使用问题中，随县特别强调了书记深入田间，带头使用新工具。县委第一书记安海田在淅河、厉山、唐镇等地亲自下田操纵插秧机，发现一部机子配一个秧箱太少，不能充足供应秧苗，有窝工现象。安海田同志立即布置全县赶做秧箱，使每部插秧机另外配备了一个预备秧箱，因而工效提高一倍以上，社员也喜欢用了。在第一书记带头下，县委书记处书记也分头带领工作组下乡，帮助各地解决新工具推广中的具体问题。
    在解决新工具的推广使用中，随县紧紧抓住了迅速培养技术力量这一环节，普遍采取师傅带徒弟、开训练班等办法，培养出一万七千多名技术人员。他们既会使用又会修理新工具，因此成为推广新工具的骨干。例如全县集中了二百多个学员，现场操作、田间讲课，使他们迅速掌握了插秧机的全部操作技术，并及时派他们到各公社、管理区办训练班，传授技术，这样全县的插秧机每部都有了两个插秧机手。与此同时，县委还强调了抓改革工具与创造使用条件的结合，改革车子与修路相结合，改革石滚与改革稻场相结合等，大大提高了工具的使用率。（附图片）
