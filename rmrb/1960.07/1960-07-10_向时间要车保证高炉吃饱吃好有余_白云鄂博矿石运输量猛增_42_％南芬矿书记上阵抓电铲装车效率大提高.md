Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, July 9th: The workers of the Baiyunebo Iron Mine Transportation Department, closely coordinating with the substantial leap forward in ore production, launched a mass movement to "squeeze time to get cars," increasing ore transport volume by 42% in the most recent ten days compared to early June.

Since June, the iron mine's workers have put forward the slogan "Fight a decisive battle in the third quarter to ensure that blast furnaces are well-fed, well-nourished, and have plenty to spare." The daily ore output in June more than doubled compared to May. To ensure that ore was transported out in a timely manner, the mine's transportation department workers launched a "squeeze time to get cars" campaign, adopting a series of measures such as "relay switching," "combined operation and inspection," "early fueling," and "utilizing waiting-to-load and waiting-to-unload time for maintenance." In the past, when electric locomotive drivers handed over shifts, they had to stop for half an hour each time to inspect each other, totaling one and a half hours of downtime per day for three shift changes. Now, electric locomotive drivers at the mine are implementing "relay switching," proactively getting on the train early and using the locomotive's travel and waiting-to-load and waiting-to-unload time for mutual inspection, preparing for shift handover in advance. Like a relay race, as soon as the handover time arrives, the next shift driver immediately takes over the train and joins the battle, without stopping the train for handover. After this system was implemented throughout the mine, the time for one operation and inspection was shortened from the previous eighteen hours to about three hours. Electric locomotive drivers also closely cooperated with shunting personnel, adopting methods such as fueling in advance and preparing for tipping in advance, shortening the tipping time by two-thirds compared to the past. In the past month or so, the transportation workers of the iron mine have put forward more than 1,500 rationalization proposals centering on "squeeze time to get cars," increasing the utilization rate of locomotives and dump trucks, and transporting a large amount of ore to support the production of iron and steel enterprises despite the shortage of vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, July 9th: Since June, the Party Secretary and Mine Director of the Nanfen Open-Pit Iron Mine of Benxi Iron and Steel Company have led a large number of department and workshop cadres to go up the mountain and delve into the front line of production, earnestly solving problems such as equipment maintenance and production scheduling, and promoting advanced experience, so that the average daily ore output from June 7th to 28th increased by more than 17% compared to the same period last month.

The Party Secretary of the mine went to the electric shovel and worked with the electric shovel drivers to study the reasons for the low efficiency of the electric shovel. He found that some electric shovels had no ore to load, while others were unable to load in time due to the large amount of ore. Therefore, he promptly allocated electric shovels and trucks to places with more ore, increasing the amount of ore loaded and transported. The leading cadres learned from the drivers that due to poor blasting, there were many large pieces of ore in the stope, which the electric shovel could not move, often affecting the loading speed. They held a forum with the blasting workers on site and quickly promoted seven new blasting technologies such as graded charging, reducing large pieces of ore and speeding up the electric shovel loading speed. In the past, the trucks transporting ore often affected ore transportation due to untimely maintenance. In June, the leading cadres led maintenance workers to the mountain to repair the trucks, reducing the time the trucks were stopped for repairs and increasing the ore output.

    向时间要车保证高炉吃饱吃好有余
    白云鄂博矿石运输量猛增42％南芬矿书记上阵抓电铲装车效率大提高
    据新华社包头9日电　白云鄂博铁矿运输部的职工，紧密配合矿石生产的大幅度跃进，开展“向时间要车”的群众运动，使最近十天的矿石运输量比6月上旬增加了42％。
    从6月份以来，这个铁矿的职工提出“决战三季度，保证高炉吃饱、吃好、吃不了”的口号，6月份的矿石日产量比5月份猛增一倍以上。矿山运输部的职工，为了使矿石及时运出，开展“向时间要车”的运动，采取了“接力换乘”“操检合一”“提前给汽”“利用待装、待卸时间进行检修”等一系列措施。过去电机车司机进行交接班时，因为要互相检查，每次都要停驶半小时，每天交三次班，就要停驶一个半小时。现在，矿山的电机车司机实行“接力换乘”，纷纷提前上车，利用机车走行和待装、待卸时间进行互检，提早做好交接班的准备工作，像接力赛跑一样，交班时间一到，下一班的司机就马上接车投入战斗，不用再停车交班了。这个制度在全矿推行以后，一次作业检修时间，由过去的十八小时缩短到了三小时左右。电机车司机们还和调车人员密切合作，采取提前给汽、事先做好翻车准备的方法，使翻车时间比过去缩短了三分之二。一个多月来，这个铁矿的运输职工，围绕“向时间要车”，共提出了一千五百多件合理化建议，提高了机车和翻斗车的出车率，在车辆不足的情况下，运出了大量矿石支援钢铁企业的生产。
    新华社本溪9日电　本溪钢铁公司南芬露天铁矿的党委书记和矿长，从6月份以来，率领大批科室、车间干部上山深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地解决了设备检修、生产调度等问题，推广先进经验，使6月7日到28日的矿石平均日产量比上月同期提高17％以上。
    这个矿的党委书记到电铲上去，和电铲司机共同研究电铲效率低的原因。他发现有的电铲没有矿石可装，有的电铲却因矿石很多来不及装，于是及时往矿石多的地方调配电铲和卡车，增加了矿石装运量。领导干部们从司机那里了解到，由于爆破得不好，掌子里大块矿石很多，电铲啃不动，常常影响装车速度。他们就和爆破工人一起在现场开座谈会，很快推广了分级装药等七种爆破新技术，减少了大块的矿石，加快了电铲装车速度。过去，运矿石的卡车因为检修不及时，常常影响矿石运输；6月份，领导干部们带领检修工人上山检修卡车，减少了卡车停车待修的时间，增加了矿石产量。
