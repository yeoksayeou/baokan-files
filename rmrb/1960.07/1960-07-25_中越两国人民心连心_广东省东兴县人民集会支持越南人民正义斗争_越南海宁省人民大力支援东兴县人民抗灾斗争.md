    The People of China and Vietnam are of One Heart
    People's Rally in Dongxing County, Guangdong Province, Supports the Just Struggle of the Vietnamese People
    People of Hai Ninh Province, Vietnam, Vigorously Support the People of Dongxing County in their Fight Against Disaster
    (Our Dispatch) On July 20th, the people of Dongxing County, Guangdong Province, located on the Sino-Vietnamese border, held a rally of thousands of people to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. On the same day, the army of people from Hai Ninh Province, Vietnam, supporting the people of Dongxing County in their fight against the disaster, arrived in Dongxing. Before the 13th, a once-in-a-century flood occurred in the Dongxing County area. The people of Hai Ninh Province, Vietnam, demonstrated a high degree of internationalist spirit, vigorously supporting Dongxing County's fight against floods, disaster relief, and restoration of production with manpower, material resources, and morale.
    After the Hai Ninh Provincial Party Committee received news of the disaster in Dongxing County on the 12th, it immediately sent twenty-one wooden sailboats and one motorboat to the severely affected Jiangping area to assist in rescuing and transporting flood control equipment, and provided support with one thousand grass bags and materials such as grain and oil. After the flood receded, in order to help the people of Dongxing County rebuild their homes, the Hai Ninh Provincial Party Committee, through foreign trade relations, promptly transferred 100,000 bowls, 1,000 large water vats, more than 6,000 rice bowls, and a batch of other materials to support the people of Dongxing County.
    On the 20th, the Hai Ninh Provincial Party Committee also sent more than 100 cadres and residents to transport bowls, vats and other materials to Dongxing County, and provided Dongxing County with 40,000 jin of rice, 4,000 jin of cassava seeds, 4,000 jin of raw cassava, 4,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and 25,000 bowls free of charge. The Hai Ninh Provincial Party Committee of Vietnam stated that China and Vietnam are one family, and mutual help and care are entirely appropriate and necessary. The vigorous support of the Vietnamese brothers greatly encouraged the broad masses of the people in Dongxing County.
    Old farmers such as Liu Zhenfeng and Huang Shaojie, members of the Jing ethnic group in the Shanxin Brigade of Jiangping Commune, said: Dongxing County has been hit by disaster and has not only received vigorous support from the Party Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Prefectural Party Committee, but also the Vietnamese people have tried everything possible to support us. We must listen to the Party, quickly restore production, and seize a bumper harvest of late rice to repay the meticulous care of the Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Prefectural Party Committee, and to thank the brotherly support of the Vietnamese people.
