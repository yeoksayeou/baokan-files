Xinhua News Agency report: The Fourth Squad of the Second Team of the Guangmang Commune in Pangong, Xiangfan City, Hubei Province, has arranged a plan for saving grain after the summer harvest, based on the principles of eating well, eating good food, and saving.

Since setting up its canteen, this squad has implemented a method of rationing based on the number of people, eating both coarse and refined grains, planning grain consumption, and returning savings to the individuals. The commune members have not only eaten their fill but also eaten well, and every household has saved grain. After the summer harvest, the squad convened a meeting of commune members to discuss issues such as "Should we save after a good harvest? Is it stingy to plan grain consumption?" Through recalling and comparing typical facts, the commune members further understood the principle of "living frugally in good times."

Currently, this squad has formulated specific measures for saving grain after the summer harvest. Everyone has stipulated that grain distribution should be implemented by grading according to labor, rationing according to grade, eating with tickets, and returning savings to individuals. Within the prescribed grain quota, adjustments are made according to the intensity of farm work and the busy and slack seasons, and planned grain consumption is implemented in stages. The canteen posts its menu in advance, implementing the method of "knowing meals for the whole day in advance" to facilitate planned cooking. The grain consumed by the commune members is announced every ten days and settled monthly, ensuring that accounts are open, procedures are clear, and everyone knows the situation. In addition, the method of processing wheat has been improved to increase the flour yield.

Through education on saving grain, the spirit of thrift has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people in this squad. The cooks in the canteen, in order to ensure that everyone eats their fill, eats well, and avoids waste, have adopted the method of eating mixed meals, combining coarse and refined grains, and having both dry and liquid foods. The variety of meals has increased from four or five in the past to over ten. Now, everyone can eat steamed buns once every four or five days, and dumplings twice a month.

Due to careful calculation and comprehensive arrangement of the grain consumption plan, results were quickly achieved, and there was a surplus of grain.

　　精打细算　全面安排　吃饱吃省
　　庞公公社光芒二队四小队实行“饭菜一天早知道”
    据新华社讯　湖北襄樊市庞公公社光芒二队四小队，在吃饱吃好吃省的原则下，安排了夏收后的节约用粮计划。
    这个小队自从办起食堂以来，就实行了以人定量，粗细兼吃，计划用粮，节约归己的办法，社员们不仅吃得饱吃得好，而且户户有粮食节约。夏收后，小队召开了社员大会，围绕“丰收要不要节约？有计划吃粮算不算小气”等问题开展讨论。通过典型事实的回忆对比，使社员们进一步体会到了“富日子要当穷日子过”的道理。
    现在，这个小队已制定了夏收后节约用粮的具体办法。大家规定粮食分配实行按劳分等，以等定量，凭票吃饭，节约归己的办法，在规定的粮食指标内，按照农活轻重和季节忙闲进行调剂，实行分段计划用粮。食堂提前挂牌，实行“饭菜一天早知道”的办法，以便有计划地做饭。社员们吃的粮食，十天一公布，一月一结算，作到账目公开，手续清楚，人人心中有数。另外，还改进了小麦加工方法，提高了出面率。
    这个小队通过节约粮食的教育，节约之风已深入人心。食堂的炊事员们为了叫大家吃饱吃好不浪费，采取了饭菜混吃，粗细搭配，有干有稀的办法，饭食的花样由过去四、五种增加到上十种。现在每隔四、五天可吃到一次包子，一个月能吃到两次饺子。
    由于精打细算地全面安排用粮计划，很快地收到了效果，有了结余的粮食。
