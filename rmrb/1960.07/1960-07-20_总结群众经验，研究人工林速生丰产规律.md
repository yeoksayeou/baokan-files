　　Summarize Mass Experience, Study the Laws of Fast-Growing and High-Yielding Planted Forests
　　Zhu Jifan, Wang Zhan, Feng Zongwei, Institute of Forestry and Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The Party and the government attach great importance to forestry construction. In the past ten years, the national afforestation area has reached 44 million hectares (660 million mu), which is equivalent to 46% of my country's forest area before liberation. In the vigorous national afforestation movement, the broad masses have created a wealth of afforestation experience. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, while vigorously carrying out the fast-growing and high-yielding tree campaign, many high-yield forests have been discovered across the country. In the south, Chinese fir matures in ten, eight, or even six years; eucalyptus and Chinaberry become forests in five or six years; in the north, poplar and paulownia also mature in five or six years. Korean pine, which has always been considered slow-growing and difficult to plant, has a timber stock volume of over 150 cubic meters per hectare in the Caohekou area of Liaoning Province after thirty years. These facts of rapid and high-yielding forests have further encouraged the enthusiasm and confidence of the broad masses in afforestation, broken many old theories in forestry, and broken through the old concepts and superstitions of the past that "predecessors plant trees, descendants enjoy the shade," "afforestation takes at least decades to mature, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst," and "trees grow slowly."
    Summarizing the afforestation experience of the masses and elevating it to the height of theory to clarify the laws of growth and development of planted forests, especially the laws of fast-growing and high-yielding, will enable us to have foresight from the beginning of afforestation, avoid mistakes, and promote fast-growing and high-yielding trees. This is an important task.
    Planted forests are different from natural forests. Planted forests are cultivated based on human utilization of natural laws and according to economic needs. They have a clear production purpose. From the beginning of afforestation to the end of harvesting, the entire life process of planted forests is always affected by human activities, so it can be said that they are the product of labor. Natural forests, on the other hand, are the result of natural succession. Although natural forests are more or less affected by certain human activities, they are different from planted forests after all. The natural succession in the formation process of natural forests often cannot meet people's economic requirements. For example, it takes about 120 to 150 years for a natural Korean pine forest to recover from an old-generation forest to a new generation of strong forest, passing through one or two generations of broad-leaved forests in the middle. Artificial afforestation, on the other hand, can form a forest in ten to twenty years for coniferous trees, and even faster for broad-leaved trees. Trees in natural forests are uneven in height, and the distances between trees vary. This is the result of uneven seed fall and natural selection under natural regeneration. Artificial forests, due to human selection of seeds or seedlings and effective control of tree spacing, have a neat appearance, and each tree receives approximately the same nutritional area. The growth and development of the entire forest is better than that of natural forests, and productivity is naturally higher. Vigorously building various planted forests can not only provide a large amount of timber and forest by-products needed for socialist construction, but also meet the requirements of the Party's general line of socialist construction of "more, faster, better, and more economical."
    My country has a vast territory and abundant tree species. To build planted forests, we must first select suitable tree species and understand their habits. Tree habits mainly refer to the requirements of trees for climate, soil, and other factors. The masses have a lot of experience in this regard. Forest farmers in Huitong, Hunan have a saying: "Tea trees face the sun, trees need shade," which means that oil-tea camellias are suitable for sunny, well-lit, and relatively dry mountain slopes, while Chinese fir is suitable for semi-shady or shady, moist mountain slopes or mountain depressions; the masses in the north say, "Poplars in sandy soil, willows in muddy soil," which means that poplars are suitable for growing on sandy soil, and willows are suitable for growing on clay soil. Almost every region has similar valuable experiences. These experiences show that each tree species has its required site conditions. Knowing the habits of trees can avoid planting them in places that are not suitable for them and ensure the survival of afforestation. However, to make trees grow fast and produce high yields, other measures must be added.
    The experience of the working people in production practice is very valuable and should be carefully summarized. In this regard, we have the following experiences.
    1. All measures taken by the masses to cultivate trees are to create conditions for their good growth and development, so that the measures are adapted to the habits of the trees. This is most prominent in the Chinese fir forest area in the south. The masses there all know that good seeds and strong seedlings are the material basis for successful afforestation. They are strict in selecting seed trees. Chinese fir forests in mountain depressions grow best, but they have less sunlight and high humidity, and the seed quality is poor; generally, seed collection is selected from trees on sunny mountain slopes with abundant fruit, full seeds, strong age, and no disease, or well-growing scattered trees in the forest, and fire-burned trees and isolated trees are not collected. This not only attaches importance to the good heredity of forest tree seeds, but also considers the environmental conditions for future timber production, starting from the forest population rather than from the ecological conditions of a single tree. This is very scientific. When cultivating seedlings, unlike general nurseries, they use mountain seedling cultivation, selecting old barren mountains (mixed wood forest soil) with good drainage and gentle slopes for burning and land preparation for seedling cultivation. Old barren mountain soil has fewer pathogens and high natural fertility. Burning and land preparation is equivalent to a disinfection and increases phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, and also improves soil physical conditions. The short sunshine and high humidity in the mountains can avoid drought and sunscald of seedlings, prevent them from getting sick, and make them healthy and strong, with high survival rates and good growth. The masses also select suitable afforestation land based on the habits of the tree species to change the site conditions. For example, in the southern mountainous areas with steep and short slopes, when planting Chinese fir, according to the characteristics of Chinese fir's requirements for good water conditions and fertile soil, many effective measures are taken to change the site conditions. In Hunan, there is "tying up mountain ridges," which is to burn and clear the harvested land, and then horizontally arrange the remaining large branches and small-diameter wood on the tree stumps to form a row of mountains. The space above the row of mountains is filled with thatch and branches and leaves, and then soil is dug, and the soil blocks and fine mud are piled on the row of mountains, which has a great effect on preventing erosion, conserving soil and water. "Soil retaining ridges" are to horizontally accumulate small tree roots, grass roots, etc. along the slope, setting up one every one or two zhang, to avoid soil erosion. In addition, there are methods such as "building terrace ridges" and "closing waist doors." The high-yield Chinese fir forest in Jinping, Guizhou, originally had a large slope. After becoming a forest, the space between the rows was changed into a terraced shape, making the water conditions more conducive to the growth of Chinese fir. Because the masses, on the basis of understanding the habits of the tree species, exerted their subjective initiative and changed the site conditions, making the original unfavorable site conditions favorable, and the poor growth of trees good, they created high-yield conditions.
    2. The various cultivation measures taken by the masses are not mechanical and unchangeable, but embody the spirit of adapting to local conditions. The experience of the fast-growing and high-yielding forests built by the masses is based on different site conditions and economic requirements, and different measures are adopted. For example, the masses in the southern Chinese fir planted forest area are very familiar with the relationship between terrain and climate, soil, and hydrology. For Chinese fir, mountain depressions (mountain bays) are the most suitable, mountain slopes are second, and mountain ridges (mountain tops) are the worst. In terms of afforestation density, the masses are not uniform. The more suitable the conditions, the larger the row spacing and the fewer the number of trees; the worse the conditions, the smaller the row spacing and the more the number of trees. Adapting to local conditions is conducive to the early closure and normal growth of trees. The planting method is also the same. Quadrangles or rectangles are used on flat mountain depressions, while triangles are used on mountain slopes to rationally utilize the land and consider soil and water conservation. According to our investigation, in the same site conditions (both are yellow-brown loamy clay soils in mountain depressions) and the same age (nineteen years), the total stock volume of two fast-growing Chinese fir forests is similar. However, due to the different cultivation purposes determined by economic requirements, they are also different in terms of afforestation density and tending intensity (see the table below).

Cultivation purpose, Forest age, Afforestation density (plants/mu), Tending intensity, Average tree height (meters), Average diameter at breast height (cm), Stock volume (cubic meters/hectare)
Rafter timber, 19, 170, Medium, 17.0, 14.2, 350
Board timber, 19, 70, High, 16.7, 23.3, 373.5

    The above examples prove that in the practice of afforestation, the masses have mastered the laws of forest growth and development. According to the characteristics reflected under different conditions, they flexibly regulate it according to human needs. This spirit of adapting to local conditions is fully in line with the basic theory of forest typology. Therefore, summarizing the afforestation measures and high-yield experience of the masses not only accelerates the development of the forestry industry, but also enriches the theory of forest typology in our country.
    3. The masses' experience in "intercropping trees with crops" in building fast-growing and high-yielding forests is a creation of the structure of planted forests. For a long time, the masses in various parts of the country, both north and south, have had a complete set of experiences in "intercropping trees with crops" (or called agroforestry intercropping) in building various planted forests, especially economic forests. A folk song in the mountainous area of southern Anhui says: "Planting trees alone is not cost-effective, intercropping tung trees with grain is a one-shot deal, harvesting corn and tung seeds in autumn, the trees grow like flagpoles," which fully expresses the benefits of intercropping trees with crops. The emergence of intercropping trees with crops is a form of afforestation that the broad masses have found to suit economic requirements and production needs in their long-term production practice, recognizing the laws of forest growth and development in natural forests, and from the interrelationships between trees and between trees and other layers of vegetation. In fact, in addition to intercropping agriculture and forestry, intercropping trees with crops also includes mixed planting or rotation planting of trees with different ecological habits or different lifespans, such as Chinese fir and tung oil, Chinese fir and oil-tea camellia, Chinese fir and masson pine, etc. Some areas practice intercropping trees with medicinal materials, such as intercropping oil-tea camellia with Atractylodes macrocephala. Intercropping trees with crops enables various plants suitable for human production needs to grow on the same land at the same or different times. It not only makes full use of light energy and soil fertility, but also improves soil physical conditions and the mutual benefit between plants and plants due to cultivation management, further promoting tree growth. Facts have proved that trees planted with intercropping grow better than those without intercropping. According to a survey conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Forestry Department in the Xijiang Forest Farm (1958), the height and root diameter of Chinese fir forests planted in 1955 under various site conditions were one to five times higher for those intercropped with crops than those not intercropped. For example, on mountain slopes, the height of those intercropped with crops is generally 143 cm and the root diameter is 3.8 cm, while the height of those not intercropped is generally 37 cm and the root diameter is 0.6 cm. Another example is based on a survey of Robinia pseudoacacia planted young forests in Fengjiazhuang, Zichang County, Shaanxi (1959). The tree height of four-year-old Robinia pseudoacacia planted young forests intercropped with crops is 450 cm and the root diameter is 5.4 cm, while the tree height of those not intercropped but cultivated three times is 390 cm and the root diameter is 3.3 cm. Of course, in selecting intercropping crops, there must be no competition between the two. It is better if they are mutually beneficial. Therefore, it is very important to summarize the masses' experience in intercropping trees with crops and to find out the ecological and physiological relationships between different intercrops, and to propose the most suitable intercrops for each tree species under different conditions and different sites. The rich experience in intercropping trees with crops shows that the masses consider the constituent parts of planted forest communities not to imitate nature, but to have a clear production point of view. It inspires us to better utilize different trees, economic crops, food crops, and other resource plants to create planted forests that are richer in content, higher in productivity, and more stable than natural forests.
      While widely summarizing the experience of the masses and studying the laws of growth and development of planted forests, we should also conduct surveys and studies on existing natural forests and isolated trees and small forests in vast forest-free or less-forested areas. Understanding the interrelationships between trees and between trees and the environment and their growth laws in these forests will help us provide a reliable scientific basis for tree species selection, mixed planting methods, and prediction of future tree productivity when engaging in various afforestation designs. This is especially guiding in areas where forests have never grown in the past, such as afforestation in dry grasslands and various sand dunes. The practice of sand dune afforestation in Zhanggutai, Liaoning, Northeast China, proves that in 1954, planting poplars on dry sand dunes when they were still moving was not a bad effect. Once fixed, the poplars not only stopped growing but also withered, and are still only one meter high. On the other hand, Scots pines planted on the same sand dunes, although they grow slightly slower, grow better and better, exceeding the poplars. The success of building Scots pine planted forests on sand dunes is not accidental. It is inseparable from the study of the growth and development laws of natural Scots pine forests on sand dunes in Hailar, Inner Mongolia.
    Now, all parts of the country are establishing a large number of forestry bases for various forest types, vigorously running commune-run forest farms, and vigorously building fast-growing and high-yielding forests, which creates more favorable objective conditions for studying the laws of fast-growing and high-yielding planted forests. We should, on the one hand, summarize the afforestation experience of the masses more deeply, and on the other hand, conduct fixed-point research, apply the achievements of new technologies such as biophysics in modern biological science, and clarify the essence of fast-growing and high-yielding trees from the ecological and physiological aspects of tree populations, determine the requirements of trees for light, heat, water, and nutrients at different periods, and more effectively control tree growth to achieve high yields and high yields. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and with Mao Zedong Thought to guide the summarization of the afforestation experience of the masses, we will surely create a fast-growing and high-yielding forest theory with Chinese characteristics.

　　总结群众经验，研究人工林速生丰产规律
　　中国科学院林业土壤研究所　朱济凡、王战、冯宗炜
    党和政府十分重视林业建设。十年来全国造林面积达四千四百万公顷（六亿六千万亩），相当于我国解放前森林面积的46％。在轰轰烈烈的全民造林运动中，广大群众创造了丰富的造林经验。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在大力开展林木速生丰产运动的同时，全国各地先后发现了很多丰产林，南方杉木十年、八年甚至六年成材；桉树、苦楝五、六年成林；北方也出现五、六年成材的杨树和泡桐。一向被人认为生长很慢，不易栽植的红松，在辽宁省草河口一带三十年生每公顷木材蓄积量高达一百五十立方米以上。这些林木快速丰产的事实，更加鼓舞了广大群众造林的热情和信心，打破了林学上的很多旧理论，冲破了过去人们认为“前人栽树，后人乘凉”，“造林成材起码几十年，远水不解近渴”，“树木慢生”等陈旧观念和迷信。
    总结群众的这些营林经验，并把它提到理论的高度，来阐明人工林生长发展的规律，特别是速生丰产的规律就能使我们在造林之初就有预见性，避免错误，并促进林木速生丰产。这是一个重要的任务。
    人工林和天然林不同，人工林是在人类利用自然规律的基础上，根据经济需要培育出来的。它有明确的生产目的性。人工林从造林起，一直到采伐止，整个林木的生命过程，始终是受人为活动的影响，所以说它是劳动的产物。而天然林是自然演替的结果。尽管天然林也或多或少受到一定的人为活动影响，但毕竟与人工林不同。天然林形成过程中的自然演替，常常不能适合人们的经济要求。例如天然红松林从老一代森林，恢复成新的一代壮林，中间经过一、二代阔叶林，约需一百二十年到一百五十年。而人工造林，针叶树十年到二十年就能成林，阔叶树更快。天然林中林木参差不齐，林木之间距离远近不一，这是天然更新下种量、下种机会不等和自然选择的结果。人工林由于通过人对种子或苗木的选择，对林木株行距的有效控制，林相整齐，每株林木都得到差不多的营养面积，整个林子的生长和发育就比天然林好，生产力自然要高。大力营造各种人工林，不但能提供社会主义建设大量需要的木材和林副产品，而且也是符合党的社会主义建设总路线“多、快、好、省”的要求。
    我国幅员广大，树种丰富。营造人工林，首先要选择适宜树种，摸清树种的习性。树种习性主要是指树木对气候、土壤等的要求。这方面群众经验很多。湖南会同林农有一句话：“当阳茶、背阴木”，这是指油茶适宜向阳、光照充足的较干燥的山坡，杉木适宜于半阴或背阴的湿润山坡或山洼；北方群众有“沙杨泥柳”的说法，这是指杨树适宜于沙质土上生长，柳树适于粘质土上生长。几乎各地都有类似的宝贵经验。这些经验说明，每个树种都有它所要求的立地条件。知道树木习性后，就能避免把树木栽在与它不相适应的地方，保证造林成活。但要使林木速生丰产，还必须加上其他措施。
    劳动人民生产实践的经验非常珍贵，应该认真总结。在这方面，我们有如下的体会。
    一、群众对培育林木的一切措施，都是为它的良好生长和发育创造条件，使措施与树木的习性相适应。这在南方杉木林区最为突出。那里的群众都知道，良种壮苗是造林成功的物质基础。他们对采种母树选择严格，山洼的杉木林生长最好，但光照少，湿度大，种子质量差；一般采种是选光照充足的山坡地上结实多、种子丰满、壮龄而无病的林缘木，或林内生长好的散生木，不采火烧木和孤立木。这不仅是重视林木种子的良好遗传性，而且也考虑到今后成材的环境条件，从森林群体出发，而不是从单株树木的生态条件出发。这是很科学的。育苗时，与一般苗圃不同，他们采用山间育苗，选排水好、坡度不大的老荒山（杂木林土壤）进行烧垦整地育苗。老荒山土壤病原菌少，天然肥力高，加上烧垦，等于一次消毒，而且增加磷钾肥，也改善了土壤物理条件。山地日照短，湿度较大，能避免苗木干旱与日炙，使它不致得病，并健全粗壮，成活率高，生长好。群众对宜林地的选择，还根据树种习性，来改变立地条件。如南方山坡陡短的山地，群众植杉时，根据杉木要求水分条件好，土壤肥沃的特点，采取改变立地条件的很多有效措施。湖南有“扎排山”，是在采伐迹地上火烧清理后，将遗留的大枝条、小径木沿坡横架于树桩上，形成一条排山，排山上方填茅草和枝叶，然后挖土，将土块和细泥堆在排山上，对防止冲刷、保土保水作用很大。“保土埂”，是将小树根、草根等沿坡成水平堆集起来，每隔一、二丈设置一条，避免水土流失，此外尚有“筑梯埂”、“闭腰门”等方法。贵州锦屏的杉木丰产林，原来坡度较大，成林后在行间改成梯土形，使水分条件更有利于杉木生长。由于群众在摸清树种的习性基础上，发挥了主观能动作用，改变了立地条件，使原来立地条件不利的变成有利的，林木生长不良的变成生长良好的，创造了丰产条件。
    二、群众对各项栽培措施不是机械的，一成不变的，而是体现了因地制宜的精神。群众所营造的速生丰产林经验，都是根据立地条件，经济要求不同，采用不同措施的。例如南方杉木人工林区群众非常了解地形与气候、土壤、水文的关系。对杉木来说，以山洼（山湾）地最适宜，山坡次之，山脊（山顶）最差。在造林密度上，群众不是千篇一律的，条件愈宜的株行距大，株数少；条件愈差的株行距小，株数多。因地制宜有利于林木及早郁闭和正常生长。栽植方式上也是如此。在平坦山洼地上采用四方形或长方形，而在山坡地上采用三角形，合理利用土地，而又考虑到水土保持。根据我们调查，在相同的立地条件（同样是山洼黄棕色粘壤土上），相同林龄（十九年），林木总蓄积量也相仿的两块快速杉木林，由于经济要求所决定的培育目的不同，反映在林木栽培措施的造林密度和抚育强度上，也都不同（见下表）。培　育目　的林　龄造林密度（株／亩）抚育强度平均树高（米）平　均胸　径（厘米）蓄　积　量（立方米／公顷）房椽材19170中度17.014.2350板　材1970强度16.723.3373.5
    上面列举的几个例子，证明群众在营林的实践中，掌握了森林生长和发育的规律。根据在不同条件下所反映的特点，按照人的需要，灵活地来调节它。这样因地制宜的精神，完全符合于林型学说的基本理论。因此，总结群众的营林措施和丰产经验，不仅加速了森林事业的发展，而且丰富了我国林型学的理论。
    三、群众营造速生丰产林中“林粮间作”的经验，是人工林结构的一种创造。我国南北各地群众所营造的各种人工林，特别是经济林，长期以来，就有一套完整的“林粮间作”（或称农林间作）的经验。皖南山区有一首民谣：“单种树木不合算，混种桐粮一举干，秋收玉米和桐籽，树木长得赛旗杆”，充分表达了林粮间作的好处。林粮间作的产生，是广大群众在长期生产实践中，认识了天然林的森林生长和发育规律，从林木与林木之间，林木与其他层次的植被之间的互相关系中，所找出的适合经济要求和生产需要的一种造林形式。事实上，林粮间作中除了农与林间作以外，还包括了生态习性不同或寿命长短不同的林木混交或轮栽，如杉木与油桐，杉木与油茶，杉木与马尾松等等。有的地区实行林木与药材间作，如油茶与白术间作等。林粮间作使同一块地上在相同或不同时间内能生长适合人类生产需要的各种植物，不但充分利用光能和土壤肥力，并且由于耕作管理改善了土壤物理条件和植物与植物之间的互相补益，更加促进林木的生长。事实证明，造林时采用林粮间作的比不间作的生长要好。根据广东省林业厅在西江林场调查（1958），在1955年各种立地条件上所栽的杉木林，无论树高和根径，林粮间作的比不间作的均高出一至五倍。如在山腰上，林粮间作的一般高一百四十三厘米，根径三点八厘米，不间作的一般高三十七厘米，根径零点六厘米。又如根据在陕西子长县冯家庄洋槐人工林调查（1959），四年生洋槐人工幼林林粮间作的树高四百五十厘米，根径五点四厘米，不间作而抚育三次的树高三百九十厘米，根径三点三厘米。当然在选择间作作物上，必须两者没有竞争。互相有利更好。因此总结群众林粮间作经验，查明不同间作物之间的生态生理关系，为各树种提出不同时期、不同立地的条件下最宜的间作物，是很重要的。从林粮间作的丰富经验中，说明群众考虑人工林群体的组成部分，不是仿效自然，而是有明确的生产观点。它启发我们更好地利用不同的林木、经济作物，粮食作物及其他资源植物，来创造比天然林内容更为丰富、生产力更高而且稳定的人工林。
      在广泛总结群众经验，研究人工林的生长和发育规律的同时，也应该对现有的天然林和广大无林区或少林区的孤立木和小片林进行调查研究。了解这些森林中林木与林木之间，林木与环境之间的互相关系和它们的生长规律，有助于我们在从事各种造林设计时，对树种选择、混交方式以及预计将来林木的生产力提供可靠的科学依据。特别是在过去一直未长过森林的地区，如干草原、各种砂丘地的造林工作，更有指导意义。东北辽宁章古台砂丘造林的实践证明，1954年在干燥砂丘上，当它还在流动的时候，栽植杨树，效果不坏。一旦固定后，杨树不但不长反而枯梢，到现在还是一米来高。而在同样砂丘上栽植的樟子松，尽管生长稍慢，但愈长愈好，超过杨树。砂丘上营造樟子松人工林的成功，也不是碰巧的，它是同研究了内蒙古海拉尔砂丘上天然樟子松林生长和发育的规律分不开的。
    现在全国各地正大量建立各林种的林业基地，大搞社办林场，大力营造速生丰产林，这就给研究人工林的速生丰产规律创造更有利的客观条件。我们应该更深入地一方面总结群众营林经验，一方面进行定位研究，应用现代生物科学中生物物理等新技术的成就，从林木群体生态生理方面来阐明林木速生丰产的实质，确定林木不同时期对光、热、水分和营养物质的要求，更有效地控制林木生长，达到高额丰产。我们相信在党的正确领导下，用毛泽东思想来指导总结群众营林经验，一定能创造出具有中国特点的速生丰产的森林学说。
