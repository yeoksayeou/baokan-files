(Our Chongqing dispatch, July 8) After leading cadres go deep into the production front lines, can they combine points and areas to more effectively direct overall production? The Chongqing Automotive Transportation Company has answered this question in practice. Their experience proves that only by practically going into production to lead production, and going into the masses to lead the masses, can they better create and summarize experience to guide the overall situation.

Since the first quarter of this year, led by the Party Committee Secretary, the company has deployed over 80% of its cadres in complete sets to go deep into the motorcades, points along the lines, and repair work groups, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the workers, effectively strengthening leadership at the grassroots level and promoting the sustained leap forward in production. The national plan for the first half of the year was completed ahead of schedule in May, and the car-ton monthly output in June increased by 27.55% compared to May.

In order to better combine points and areas, the company's leading cadres first selected the Third Team, which has always done a relatively good job, as the focus, moved the Party Committee Office to the Third Team, and sent over twenty cadres, led by the Deputy Secretary of the Company's Party Committee, to stay there. In addition to specifically assisting grassroots leading cadres in arranging tasks, inspecting production, and comprehensively directing the production of the motorcade, the leading cadres who went deep into the motorcade also frequently went deep into the points along the lines, driving groups, and repair work groups to work alongside them, mobilize the masses, and create and summarize experience with the workers. At the same time, many advanced experiences and measures to improve transportation efficiency were first piloted in the Third Team. After gaining experience, it was promptly promoted throughout the company through on-site meetings, telephone conferences, and circulars, so that many advanced experiences in production technology and leadership work quickly blossomed and bore fruit, achieving the effect of using points to lead areas.

While focusing on advanced teams, the company also paid attention to the work of lagging teams. Led by Party Committee Secretary Duan Jianxin, twenty-nine cadres were sent to set up camp in the relatively backward Fifth Team. After they went down, they found that the Fifth Team's Party Branch Secretary had great enthusiasm, but was not good at following the mass line, and the transportation tasks were not completed well enough. After specific assistance, the branch secretary quickly improved his leadership style and resolutely relied on the masses, and the motorcade's outlook rapidly changed, and the tasks were completed very well. In order to educate the leading cadres of each team with the example of the Fifth Team, the company moved the cadre meeting to the Fifth Team to be held, and the experience of the Fifth Team was disseminated at the meeting, which greatly inspired other cadres.

In addition, the company also formulated a system of holding an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee every ten days. These meetings are generally held in the teams, exchanging information and problems learned in the motorcades, discussing and studying problems together, and then formulating specific methods for continuing to implement the Party's policies, which are then brought to the various motorcades for implementation. In this way, it is also better to combine points and areas. (Attached photo)

    重庆汽车运输公司领导干部到第一线去充分发挥领导作用
    深入一点　点面结合　以点带面
    本报重庆8日电　领导干部深入生产第一线后，能不能作到点面结合，更有效地指挥全面生产，重庆市汽车运输公司在实践中回答了这个问题。他们的经验证明，只有踏踏实实地到生产中去领导生产，到群众中去领导群众，才能更好地创造和总结经验，指导全面。
    这个公司今年第一季度以来，由党委书记挂帅，把公司80％以上的干部配成套，分别深入到车队、点线、保修工班，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，切实加强了对基层的领导，促进了生产的持续跃进。上半年国家计划在5月份就提前超额完成，6月份车吨月产比5月份增长27.55％。
    为了更好地作到点面结合，这个公司的领导干部首先选择了一向工作做得比较好的第三队为重点，把党委办公室搬到三队去，由公司党委副书记挂帅，带领了二十多名干部前往蹲点。深入车队的领导干部除了具体协助基层领导干部布置任务、检查生产、全面指挥车队的生产外，还经常深入点线、行车小组、保修工班跟班劳动，发动群众，和工人一起创造和总结经验。同时，许多提高运效的先进经验和措施，也先在三队试点。取得经验以后，即通过现场会议、电话会议、通报等形式，及时在全公司推广，使不少生产技术和领导工作中的先进经验，迅速地开花结果，收到了以点带面的效果。
    在大抓先进的同时，公司还注意了抓落后队的工作。由党委书记段建新挂帅，派出了二十九名干部到比较后进的五队安营扎寨。他们下去以后，发现五队党支部书记的干劲大，就是不善于走群众路线，运输任务完成得不够好。经过具体帮助，支部书记很快改进了领导作风，坚决依靠群众，车队的面貌迅速改变了，任务完成得也很好。为了以五队的实例教育各队的领导干部，公司把干部会议搬到五队去召开，会上传播了五队的经验，对其他干部有很大启发。
    此外，这个公司还制订了十天开一次党委扩大会议的制度，这种会议一般都在队上召开，互相交流在车队了解到的情况和问题，共同讨论和研究问题，然后制定出继续贯彻党的政策的具体办法，再分别带到各个车队贯彻执行。这样，也就更好地作到了点面结合。（附图片）
