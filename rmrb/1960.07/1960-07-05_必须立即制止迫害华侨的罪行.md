An appalling incident of massacring overseas Chinese has occurred in Indonesia. On the morning of July 3rd, the military authorities of West Java dispatched armed military police to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese in Tjimatje. During the forced relocation, Indonesian police shot and killed overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei (who died on the spot) and Ye Jinniang (who died en route to the hospital); two other overseas Chinese were injured by gunfire, and many more were arrested. The news has aroused boundless indignation among all the Chinese people.

Recently, thanks to the joint efforts of peace-loving people and enlightened individuals with foresight in Indonesia, there were rumors that the anti-Chinese trend of thought among powerful groups in Indonesia might ease up somewhat. However, very unfortunately, the bloodbath of July 3rd once again proves that the powerful groups in Indonesia not only have no intention of easing up on their persecution of overseas Chinese, but are intensifying it, even going so far as to create bloody tragedies to further poison the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, in order to achieve their ulterior motives.

The massacre of overseas Chinese in Tjimatje was by no means accidental. It was a bloody tragedy deliberately created by forces in Indonesia who are hostile to China and to Indonesian-Chinese friendship. Recently in Indonesia, anti-Chinese activities have not only not subsided, but have intensified. People have paid particular attention to the military authorities in West Java, who have faithlessly gone back on the Indonesian government's promise not to force the relocation of overseas Chinese. Since the end of May, they have launched a second large-scale forced relocation and anti-Chinese campaign. In the course of forcing the relocation of overseas Chinese, the military authorities in West Java have repeatedly resorted to barbaric methods such as arrests, summonses, armed military police threats, and sealing up houses, violating the personal freedom and property of overseas Chinese. The anti-Chinese forces in Indonesia even openly clamored that, in order to force the relocation of overseas Chinese, they would not hesitate to "create bloodshed." Now, the forces in Indonesia hostile to China and Indonesian-Chinese friendship have begun to strike.

Not only that, these murderers are also trying to destroy evidence in order to deny their crimes in the face of world opinion. They snatched the bodies of the murdered overseas Chinese and washed away the bloodstains on the ground with water. However, even if the bloodstains of the murdered overseas Chinese can be washed away, the crimes of those murderers can absolutely not be denied in front of the whole world. The Chinese people deeply understand that the Indonesian people are friends of the Chinese people, and they have brotherly feelings for the overseas Chinese. And those murderers are only a handful of reactionaries. They are despised by the Indonesian people who cherish the friendship between China and Indonesia. To immediately stop this activity of the powerful groups in Indonesia of murdering overseas Chinese and intensifying the anti-Chinese activities, is the common demand of the people of both China and Indonesia. The Indonesian government has the responsibility to severely punish the murderers of the overseas Chinese, to compensate the families of the victims, to immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, to stop the forced relocation, and to take effective measures to immediately stop the anti-Chinese activities that poison the friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

    必须立即制止迫害华侨的罪行
    本报评论员
    在印度尼西亚发生了惊人的惨杀华侨的事件。7月3日清晨，西爪哇军事当局派出武装军警在芝马圩对华侨进行武力迫迁，在迫迁中，印度尼西亚的警察开枪打死了华侨妇女杨木妹（当场毙命）和叶金娘（在运往医院途中毙命）；打伤了两名华侨，并且逮捕了华侨多人。消息传来，激起了全中国人民的无比的愤慨。
    最近，由于印度尼西亚爱好和平的人民和开明的有见识人士的共同努力，曾经一度传出了印度尼西亚有势力集团的排华风潮可能有某些和缓的传说。但是，非常不幸，7月3日的血案又一次证明，印度尼西亚的有势力集团不但没有缓和排华的打算，而且更加变本加厉地迫害华侨，甚至不惜制造流血惨案，进一步毒害中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系，以图达到他们不可告人的目的。
    芝马圩的惨杀华侨事件的发生，绝不是偶然的，这是印度尼西亚敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力所蓄意制造的流血惨剧。最近在印度尼西亚，排华和反华活动不仅没有收敛，反而更加加紧了。人们特别注意到西爪哇军事当局，毫无信义地背弃了印度尼西亚政府所作过的不再强迫华侨迁移的诺言，从5月下旬起就对华侨开始了第二次大规模迫迁和排华活动。在迫迁华侨的活动中，西爪哇军事当局一再使用逮捕、传讯、派军警武力威胁、标封房屋等野蛮手段，侵犯华侨的人身自由和财产。印度尼西亚的排华势力甚至公然叫嚷说，为了强迫华侨迁移，将不惜“制造流血事件”。现在，印度尼西亚敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力已经开始下毒手了。
    不仅如此，这些杀人犯，在杀人之后还妄图消灭罪证，以便在世界舆论面前抵赖他们的罪行。他们抢走被枪杀的华侨的尸体，用水冲刷地上的血迹。但是，纵然遇害华侨的血迹可以被冲刷掉，那些杀人犯的罪行在全世界面前是绝对无法抵赖的。中国人民深深地理解，印度尼西亚人民是中国人民的朋友，他们同华侨有着亲如兄弟的感情。而那些杀害华侨的凶手仅仅是一小撮反动分子。他们是为珍重中国和印度尼西亚友谊的印度尼西亚人民所不齿的。立即制止印度尼西亚有势力集团这种杀害华侨、加紧排华的活动，是中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的共同要求。印度尼西亚政府有责任严惩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤被害者的家属，立即释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁，并采取有效措施，使毒害中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的排华活动立即停止下来。
