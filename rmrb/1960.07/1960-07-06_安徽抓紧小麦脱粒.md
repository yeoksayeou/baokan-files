Xinhua News Agency report: Anhui Province is speeding up wheat threshing after the wheat harvest to prevent the wheat from molding due to rain and to ensure that every grain of harvested wheat is safely stored. As of June 27, over 70% of the harvested area in the province had been threshed.

Recently, Anhui has experienced continuous cloudy and rainy days. In order to seize the time to thresh wheat, various localities have made specific arrangements according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, and have drawn a large number of cadres from the Party committees and county committees to go deep into the communes, production teams, and threshing grounds to strengthen leadership. People's communes in various places have rationally arranged their labor forces and, without affecting summer planting, have vigorously mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as threshing in temporary sheds on the fields and indoor threshing, trying every means to speed up the progress of wheat threshing. In Huoqiu County, more than 23,000 empty warehouses, dining halls, auditoriums, and offices have been vacated for threshing. In the Liu'an area, a comprehensive inspection of the threshing grounds was carried out, mobilizing commune members to turn and dry the damp wheat, move the low-lying wheat stacks to higher ground, combine small stacks into large stacks, cover the top of the wheat stacks with thick straw, and dig drainage ditches around the base of the wheat stacks to ensure that all harvested wheat is undamaged.

The Huaibei counties, which are the main wheat-producing areas, are making great efforts to reform tools to speed up wheat threshing. Many communes have switched to using one animal to pull multiple stone rollers and installing ball bearings on the stone rollers, which generally speeds up the threshing progress by two to three times. The Qianwangzhuang Brigade of the Tongcheng Commune in Linquan County has created a simple, low-cost, high-efficiency, and suitable-for-indoor use push-pull wheat threshing machine. Three people operating it can thresh 1,500 to 2,000 jin of wheat per day, multiplying work efficiency.

    安徽抓紧小麦脱粒
    据新华社讯　安徽各地在麦收后抓紧小麦脱粒工作，以防止小麦因雨霉变，确保收割下的麦子粒粒归仓。到6月27日止，全省脱粒的小麦已占收割面积70％以上。
    最近安徽各地连日阴雨。为了抓紧时间脱粒小麦，各地根据省委指示，都作了具体部署，并且从地委、县委机关抽调大批干部深入社、队和麦场，加强领导。各地人民公社都合理地安排了力量，在不影响夏种的情况下，大力发动群众，采取就场基搭篷脱粒和室内脱粒的办法，千方百计加快小麦脱粒进度。霍丘县腾出来供脱粒用的空仓库、饭厅、大礼堂、办公室等，就有两万三千多间。六安专区各地开展麦场全面大检查，发动社员翻晒潮麦，把低处麦堆移到高处，小堆并成大堆，麦堆顶加盖厚草压住，麦堆基脚四周挖沟排水，保证已收割的麦子全部无损。
    小麦主要产地的淮北各县，都在大闹工具改革，加快小麦脱粒进度。很多公社改用一畜多磙和在石磙上安装滚珠轴承，使脱粒进度一般都加快两三倍。临泉县桐城公社前王庄大队创制了一种制作简便、成本低、工效高，又适于在室内用的推拉式小麦脱粒机，三人操作，每天可脱粒一千五百斤到两千斤，工效成倍提高。
