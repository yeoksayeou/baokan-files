Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 29th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article today sternly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its Laotian running dogs in undermining the Geneva Accords on Laos for the past six years.

The article pointed out that in order to sabotage the Geneva Accords on Laos and turn Laos into a U.S. colony and war base, U.S. imperialism has been carrying out barbaric interference in Laos for the past six years. This is the direct cause of the serious situation in Laos. The article believes that this serious situation hides extremely dangerous factors that threaten peace and security in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The article revealed that in 1959, the United States shipped 1,600 tons of weapons and other military supplies to Laos. The U.S. military advisory group in Laos has been constantly expanding. Up to now, the number of U.S. advisors and "experts" engaged in espionage activities in Laos has reached 500. With U.S. "aid," the Laotian army has expanded from the original 25,000 to 32,000 men, and the police force has expanded from 3,000 to 5,000. In addition, a "Civil Guard Corps" with 16,000 men, a bandit force of 2,000 men, and a paratrooper battalion have been organized. The United States has also helped Laos expand and build 30 new airports.

The article said that the "Laotian Patriotic News," published on July 13, pointed out that in June of this year, the United States provided huge sums of money to help Laos build strategic highways in the border areas of Thailand and South Vietnam, and doubled U.S. military aid to Laos. The article pointed out, "Obviously, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its efforts to turn Laos into a hotbed of war. The people of Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world must heighten their vigilance and resolutely struggle to extinguish the flames of war that are brewing in Laos."

The article also condemned U.S. imperialism for instructing the extremely reactionary leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and the "People's Social Party"—the Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique—to establish a Ngo Dinh Diem-style fascist system in Laos. The article said that the Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique is promoting so-called "consolidation of rural areas" and "development of agriculture" policies in Laos, attempting to drive the people into concentration camps. The "Self-Reliance Villages" they established in Laos are, in fact, nothing more than the "agrovilles" and "land development centers" established by the Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam.

The article cited materials from the "Laotian Patriotic News" as pointing out that since U.S. imperialism helped the Laotian reactionaries launch a civil war, the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" have successively killed 1,093 people, burned down 195 villages, and driven 11,035 people into concentration camps.

The article pointed out that the Laotian people are determined to follow the path of national salvation pointed out by the Laotian Patriotic Front. The article expressed confidence that "with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of Indochina, Asia, Africa, and the world, and inspired by the surging anti-U.S. movement developing in Asia, the Laotian people will surely be able to overcome any obstacles on their path forward and achieve their goals of struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 27th. "Laotian Patriotic News" recently published a commentary sternly condemning the U.S. imperialism's intensified interference in Laos, which has further deteriorated the situation in Laos.

This commentary in the "Laotian Patriotic News" published on July 13, pointed out that during the meeting held in Washington in June of this year, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc plotted to strengthen further armed intervention in Laos, and decided to increase aid in weapons and military supplies to Ngo Dinh Diem and Laos, to suppress the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the people of South Vietnam and the people of Laos. The commentary pointed out that in order to promote its aggressive plans, U.S. imperialism also decided to give huge sums of money to the Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique to help them build strategic highways, especially the highways from Laos to the border areas of Thailand and South Vietnam. The Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique also frequently sends paratroopers to Thailand for training, and sends many personnel to the Philippines, the Federation of Malaya, and South Vietnam to learn the experience of suppressing the people. U.S. imperialism has recently built a radio station for Laos to expand war propaganda.

The commentary emphasized that facts have proven that since U.S. imperialism supported its loyal running dogs, the Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique, in seizing all the power of the Laotian government, the situation in Laos has further deteriorated.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 27th. According to the "Laotian Patriotic News," the Laotian Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith clique, in order to strengthen its reactionary rule, is stepping up internal purges and accelerating the "militarization" of government organizations at all levels.

This newspaper reported on July 19 that now the heads of government organizations in Laos from the central to the commune level, if they are not members of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" or the "People's Social Party," or do not actively implement the policies of war and suppression of the people, will gradually be purged and replaced by loyal military officers who have received reactionary political and espionage training as well as military training.

In Savannakhet, Luang Prabang, and other provinces, the Laotian reactionary authorities also require county chiefs, commune chiefs, and township chiefs to possess "military command skills," otherwise, they must resign.

According to reports, the provincial governor of Xieng Khouang Province, and the county chiefs of Muang Kham and Ta Thom counties have been dismissed. Many employees working in Vientiane, Pakse, and Luang Prabang have also been transferred because they do not meet the requirements.

    越南“人民报”和“老挝爱国新闻”发表评论
    谴责美国破坏日内瓦协议干涉老挝内政
    老挝反动当局清洗各级政权加强军事统治
    新华社河内29日电　越南“人民报”今天发表文章严厉谴责美帝国主义和它的老挝走狗六年来破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的罪行。
    文章指出，为了破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和战争基地，美帝国主义六年来一直对老挝进行了野蛮的干涉。这是造成老挝的严重局势的直接原因。文章认为这种严重局势隐藏着威胁印度支那和东南亚地区和平和安全的非常危险的因素。
    文章揭露，1959年，美国向老挝运进的武器和其他军用品达到了一千六百吨。美国在老挝的军事顾问组织不断地扩大，到现在为止，美国顾问和在老挝进行间谍活动的“专家”已达五百名。在美国的“援助”下，老挝的军队已从原来的二万五千人扩充到三万二千人，警察从三千人扩充到五千人，此外还组织了一个拥有一万六千人的“民卫团”二千人的土匪队伍和一个伞兵营。美国还帮助老挝扩建和新建了三十个飞机场。
    文章说，7月13日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”指出，今年6月间，美国又提供巨款帮助老挝在泰国和越南南方边界地带建设战略公路，并把美国对老挝的军事援款增加一倍。文章指出，“很显然，美帝国主义正在加紧把老挝变成一个战争温床。印度支那、东南亚和全世界人民必须提高警惕，坚决为扑灭正在老挝酝酿着的战争火焰而斗争。”
    文章还谴责美帝国主义指使“保卫国家利益委员会”和“人民社会党”极端反动的头目们——富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团在老挝建立吴庭艳式的法西斯制度。文章说，富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团正在老挝推行所谓“巩固农村”、“发展农业”等政策；企图把人民赶进集中营。它们在老挝成立的“自立乡”，实际上不外是吴庭艳集团在越南南方成立的“稠密区”和“垦荒区”。
    文章援引“老挝爱国新闻”的材料指出，自从美帝国主义帮助老挝反动派发动内战以来，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们先后共杀害了一千零九十三人，烧毁了一百九十五个乡，把一万一千零三十五人赶进集中营。
    文章指出，老挝人民坚决走老挝爱国战线党所指出的救国道路。文章表示相信“在印度支那、亚非和世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，在亚洲汹涌澎湃发展的反美运动的鼓舞下，老挝人民一定能够排除他们前进道路上的任何障碍，达到他们的奋斗目标”。
    新华社河内27日电　“老挝爱国新闻”最近发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义加紧对老挝的干涉，使得老挝局势进一步恶化。
    7月13日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”的这篇评论指出，今年6月间，美帝国主义和它的东南亚侵略集团的走狗们在华盛顿举行的会议上，策划加强对老挝的进一步武装干涉，并决定增加对吴庭艳和老挝的武器和军用物资的援助，来镇压越南南方人民和老挝人民的反美爱国斗争。评论指出，美帝国主义为了推行它的侵略计划，还决定给富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团巨款，帮助他们修筑战略公路，特别是老挝通往泰国和越南南方的边界地带的公路。富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团还经常派伞兵到泰国实习，派许多人员到菲律宾、马来亚联合邦、越南南方学习镇压人民的经验。美帝国主义最近又为老挝建设了一个广播电台，来扩大战争宣传。
    评论强调指出，事实证明，自从美帝国主义扶持它的忠实走狗富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团掌握老挝政府的一切权柄以来，老挝的局势已经进一步恶化。
    新华社河内27日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”报道，老挝富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团，为了加强它的反动统治，正在加紧清洗内部，加快实行各级政权机构的“军事化”。
    这家报纸7月19日报道，现在在老挝从中央到社的政权机构负责人，如果不是“保卫国家利益委员会”或“人民社会党”的成员，或是不积极执行战争和镇压人民的政策，就将逐渐被清洗出去，而代之以受过反动政治和间谍训练以及军事训练的忠实军官。
    在沙弯那吉、琅勃拉邦等省，老挝反动当局还要求县长、社长、乡长具备“军事指挥技术”，否则，就必须辞职。
    据报道，川圹省省长，芒堪、塔探县县长已被革职。在万象、巴色、琅勃拉邦工作的许多职员也因为不符合要求已被调职。
