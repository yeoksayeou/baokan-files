　　True Gold in the Crucible
　　By Our Correspondent　Zhang Jie
    At the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, two towering open-hearth furnace chimneys spew out pale yellow smoke day and night. This year, the national red flag for small open-hearth steelmaking is planted here.

    During the June steel battle, they shortened the smelting time of one heat of steel to four hours and forty-five minutes, creating a new record of 703 tons of steel produced by the workshop in a single day. Now, many workers on both furnaces have skillfully mastered these new technologies. However, not long ago, the promotion of new technologies caused a heated debate in the workshop. From this debate, we can see that the promotion and use of new technologies is not only a major revolution in production technology, but also, first and foremost, a major revolution in people's thinking, a complex struggle to change production methods that people have become accustomed to for many years.
            A Debate
    The matter was this: In order to produce more and better steel with existing equipment, the masses in the open-hearth furnace workshop successfully tested five new steelmaking technologies, such as blowing compressed air into the molten pool, during the technical revolution. After several tests, the average smelting time for each heat of steel could be shortened by half an hour. Half an hour has a special meaning in the hearts of steelworkers: time is steel, and half an hour can smelt more than ten tons of steel! Zhou Jiangen, the young team's furnace chief, and his assistant Chen Along, among others, went to the general branch secretary several times, eager to use all these new technologies at once to produce more steel.

    After discussion, the workshop's general party branch decided to fully promote these new technologies. Coincidentally, at this time, changes occurred in the furnace: the furnace walls were severely corroded, the checker brickwork (regenerator) was blocked, and the smelting time was extended. As soon as the general branch's decision was announced, the workshop became lively, and there was much discussion. Zhou Renqing, the duty director, shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this, saying, "Experiments are fine, but how can we promote them comprehensively?"

    Zhong Jingen, another duty director, also said, "What's the use of making a few high-yield heats? It's better to fight a 'protracted war' with the old method. A steady stream is more reliable." The workshop's technician even took a piece of burnt brick from the checker brickwork and placed it on his desk, telling everyone he met, "At this rate, the furnace will definitely break down in less than a week."

    When they said this, several steelworkers and duty directors who had originally advocated the use of new technologies became unsure. Some people said, "Old Zhou and Old Zhong have been dealing with the furnace for thirteen or fourteen years, and they can tell at a glance if something is wrong as soon as they walk into the workshop. What if the furnace really breaks down?"

    However, many workers in the youth team and other teams did not think so. According to their several experiments, the new technologies were effective. Later, problems did occur, but why was the production situation normal when some people operated, while accidents occurred when others operated? Zhou Jiangen and his comrades suspected that there were operational problems, and therefore firmly advocated seeking improvement in the process of promotion.
            Welcoming the Test
    One morning at the end of March, as soon as Tang Zhougen, the deputy secretary of the general branch, walked into the workshop, Zhou Renqing, Zhong Jingen, and several others came up to him. Zhou Renqing suddenly requested the general branch to approve their undertaking of the production task of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace and conduct a competition with the No. 1 furnace. It turned out that they had heard that the general branch had decided to comprehensively use new technologies on the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, and several of them had discussed in advance: the workshop's production task for April was 15,000 tons, with each furnace taking half, and the No. 2 furnace had better equipment conditions and a furnace hearth that was 1.2 square meters larger than the No. 1 furnace. In this way, they were sure to complete the production task by taking over the No. 2 furnace, even without using the new technologies. They estimated that if the No. 1 furnace had some accidents after using the new technologies, the No. 2 furnace would be sure to win. The general branch committee saw the essence of this competition and immediately studied the competition issue between the two furnaces that day. At the meeting, some people thought that people like Zhou Renqing were conservative. Zhou Fukun, the secretary of the general branch, felt that making such a conclusion too early would not solve the problem. Over the long term, Zhou Fukun had already understood the temperaments of comrades like Zhou Renqing and Zhong Jingen. In production, they were the kind of people who had the final say, and the furnace was everything to them. However, it was not easy to get such people to change their operational habits of many years! The general branch committee's research result was that new things should grow and improve in battle, and the judgment of the masses should be trusted, and the facts would explain the problem more clearly!

    Before the competition started, the comrades of the No. 2 furnace named their furnace the "High-Yield Furnace," and the comrades of the No. 1 furnace called their furnace the "Experimental Furnace." The High-Yield Furnace was responsible by duty directors Zhou Renqing and Zhong Jingen, etc., and the Experimental Furnace sent Wang Zhangfa, the deputy director of the workshop, as their representative. Both sides signed a competition agreement.
              Rapid Decline
    As soon as the competition gongs and drums sounded, the people on both furnaces immediately threw themselves into the battle. On the No. 1 furnace, Wang Zhangfa, the deputy director of the workshop, and the furnace front workers were very busy, adding slag materials and blowing compressed air from time to time... The "High-Yield Furnace," on the other hand, seemed to be very rhythmic, adding materials when it was time to add materials, and resting to watch the No. 1 furnace during refining, doing everything as before. However, everyone's heart was like a tightly stretched string, particularly nervous. One day, two days... They held a competition every day, and the mobile red flag kept "flowing back and forth" between the two furnaces. The red flag was snatched away by the No. 2 furnace, and the comrades of the No. 1 furnace immediately took measures to catch up. The next day, the comrades of the No. 2 furnace beat gongs and drums again to send the red flag back. This cycle repeated again and again, and the two furnaces competed for the red flag very enthusiastically.

    Both furnaces summed up their experiences, and the general branch specifically found someone to introduce the advantages of the new technologies to all the workshop's employees. The second round of the competition began again. This time, it started off badly, and the mobile red flag "wouldn't move," always being planted on the No. 1 furnace. At first, the duty director of the No. 2 furnace remained calm, but there were many opinions from the masses. Zhong Daming, who was still the furnace chief of Team C at the time, advocated trying the new technologies. When the duty director heard this, he said decisively, "How can that be? What kind of 'protracted war' would it be if we experimented?" After half a month, the No. 2 furnace had fallen far behind. At the evaluation meeting, the duty directors of the No. 2 furnace were asked to summarize the reasons for the backwardness, and they all pushed back and forth, remaining silent. The No. 1 furnace, on the other hand, was summarizing set after set of experiences at this time. The general branch secretary affirmed the experience of the No. 1 furnace and encouraged Zhou Renqing and others of the No. 2 furnace to go back and think of ways to catch up.

    That night, Zhou Renqing returned to the furnace front. When Zhou Jiangen saw the duty director coming, he deliberately said loudly to the furnace chief, "People on the No. 1 furnace are flying with the wings of new technology. Are we just going to stare blankly without moving?" They secretly glanced at Old Zhou: Old Zhou didn't respond. Just as they were about to start working, Old Zhou came up to stop them again. Zhou Jiangen said, "Let's try a small test first and see." When Old Zhou saw the stubbornness of Zhou Jiangen and the others, and thought of the words of the general branch secretary, he had no choice but to let the workers do it. Once they did it, it was really effective. The smelting time for the first heat was shortened by more than ten minutes, and the workers of Team C were extremely happy. They simply followed the example of the No. 1 furnace and worked hard. When they got off work, they told Wang Lanfang's team about this. Wang Lanfang, the furnace chief, had also originally opposed trying it, but when he saw that Team C had achieved results, he also started working on it himself. At this time, the new technologies, like a torrent breaking through a dam, scattered all doubts and criticisms and truly entered everyone's heart.
            Deep Roots and Lush Foliage
    One day in June, we met the general branch secretary in the workshop. Seeing the situation of the workers using new operating technologies on the two furnaces, the general branch secretary said meaningfully, "The matter is not over yet." The new technologies were promoted to production, and the workers were very happy, and began to use them excessively, causing some minor problems; after they were discovered, the corrections were also excessive, and the effects were also worse. The workers said that this was a "left-right" swing in use. However, despite these twists and turns, things that are truly rooted in the masses can withstand any test. Although problems are constantly being discovered in the use of new technologies, there are very few discussions about blaming the new technologies for shortening the life of the furnace or causing accidents. Now, what cadres, workers, and technical personnel are all concerned about is: how to better exert the role of new technologies and make production even better. The workers have shown a huge enthusiasm for new things, constantly exploring operating rules from their use, and conquering the various difficulties that arise in the process of use with strong will, riding the waves of new technologies and moving forward.

　　烈火真金
　　本报记者　张杰
    上钢一厂，两座高耸的平炉烟囱，日日夜夜喷吐着淡黄色烟雾。今年的全国小型平炉炼钢红旗就插在这里。
    6月夺钢大战中，他们曾将一炉钢的冶炼时间缩短到四小时四十五分，创造了车间日产钢七百零三吨的新纪录。现在，两只炉子上不少工人都已熟练掌握这些新技术了。可是，就在不久之前，在推广新技术时，车间里还引起过一场热烈的争论。从这场争论中可以看出，新技术的推广使用，不仅是生产技术上的大革命，而且首先是人们思想的大革命，是改变多少年来人们已经习惯了的生产方法的复杂斗争。
            一场争论
    事情是这样的：平炉车间群众，为了用现有设备炼出更多、更好的钢，在技术革命中，他们试验成功熔池吹压缩空气等五项炼钢新技术。试验过好几次，平均每炉钢可以缩短冶炼时间半小时。半小时，在炼钢工人心里，可有着特别含义，时间就是钢，半小时就能够炼十几吨钢啊！青年班的炉长周见根一助手陈阿龙等人，一连找总支书记好几次，恨不得一下把这些新技术全用上，炼出更多的钢来。
    车间党总支讨论后，决定全面推广这些新技术。恰巧，就在这个时候，炉子上发生了变化，炉墙浸蚀得厉害，格子房（蓄热室）堵塞，冶炼时间延长了。总支决定一传出去，车间里可热闹起来了，议论也多了。值班主任周仁庆一听，连连摇头说，搞试验还可以，全面推广怎么行？
    另一个值班主任钟金根也说，放几炉高产有什么用，还是老办法打“持久战”好，细水长流靠得住。车间的技术员还亲自到格子房拿了块烧坏的砖，放在办公桌上，见人就说，照这样下去，炉子用不了一个星期一定坏。
    他们这样一讲，几个原来主张使用新技术的炼钢工和值班主任也拿不准了，有人说，老周、老钟他们和炉子打了十三、四年交道了，什么地方出毛病，他们走进车间一眼就能看得出。炉子真的搞坏了怎么办？
    可是青年班和其他班的很多工人并不这样想，根据他们几次试验，新技术都是见效的。后来是出过毛病，可是为什么有的人操作时生产情况就很正常，而另外几个人操作就出事故哩？周见根和同志们商量，怀疑是操作上的问题，因此，坚决主张在推广中求改进。
            迎接考验
    3月底的一天清晨，总支副书记唐周根刚走进车间，周仁庆、钟金根等几个人就迎了上来。周仁庆突然要求总支批准他们包下二号平炉的产量任务，和一号炉进行一次竞赛。原来他们听到总支决定要在一号平炉上全面使用新技术，几个人事先就商量：4月份车间生产任务一万五千吨，两只炉子各拿一半，而二号炉设备条件好，炉膛又比一号炉大一点二平方米。这样他们包了二号炉，就是不使用新技术，也笃定完成生产任务。他们估计，一号炉用了新技术，如果出了点事故，二号炉胜利是满有把握的了。总支委员会看出了这场竞赛的实质，当天就研究了两只炉子的竞赛问题。会上，有人认为，像周仁庆这样的人，就是保守。总支书记周富坤觉得这样过早下结论，并不能解决问题。长期以来，周富坤已经摸透了周仁庆、钟金根这些同志的脾气了，在生产上，他们是说一不二的人，炉子就是他们的一切。可是，要让这样的人一下改变多少年来的操作习惯不简单啊！总支委员会研究结果，认为新生事物应该在战斗中成长、完善，应该相信群众的判断能力，事实也会更清楚地说明问题！
    竞赛开始前，二号炉同志将自己炉子命名为“高产炉”，一号炉同志就称自己炉为“试验炉”，高产炉由值班主任周仁庆、钟金根等负责，试验炉推派了车间副主任王涨法做代表，双方签订了竞赛协议。
              急流直下
    竞赛锣鼓一响，两只炉子上的人都立即投入了战斗。一号炉上，车间副主任王涨法和炉前工人都很忙碌，一会加渣料，一会吹压缩空气……“高产炉”呢，看起来很有节奏，该加料的时候加料，精炼的时候就歇下来看着一号炉，一切按老样子做下去，可是，每个人的心都像绷紧了的弦似的，格外紧张。一天、两天……每天评比一次，流动红旗不停地在两只炉子“流来流去”。红旗被二号炉夺去了，一号炉同志就立即采取措施追上去，第二天，二号炉同志又敲锣打鼓把红旗送回来。如此一次又一次循环往返，两只炉子红旗争夺得很热烈。
    两只炉子都总结了经验，总支又专门找人向全车间职工介绍了新技术的优点，第二个回合的竞赛又开始了。这回一开始就不妙，流动红旗“流不动”了，老是插在一号炉上。起先二号炉值班主任还沉住气，群众意见可多了。当时还是丙班炉长的钟大明主张试一试新技术，值班主任一听，斩钉截铁地说：那怎么行，试验了还算什么“持久战”。过了半个月，二号炉已经远远落在后面。评比会上，让二号炉的几个值班主任总结出落后原因，他们都推来推去，低头不语。一号炉呢，这时候却总结出一套又一套经验。总支书记肯定了一号炉的经验，同时鼓励二号炉周仁庆等回去好好想办法赶上去。
    当天深夜，周仁庆回到炉前。周见根见到值班主任来了，故意大声对炉长说：人家一号炉插上新技术的翅膀在飞，难道咱们就瞪着眼不动？他们偷偷看了老周一眼：老周没有响。刚要动手干，老周又上来阻止了。周见根说：先小试一下看吧。老周看到周见根几个人固执的样子，又想起了总支书记的话，也就只好让工人干了。一干，真灵验，头一炉就缩短冶炼时间十多分钟，丙班工人高兴得不得了。索性照一号炉样子大干起来。下班的时候他们又把这件事告诉了王兰芳班。炉长王兰芳原来也是不主张试的，见到丙班试出了效果，他也自己动手干了起来。这时候，新技术像冲破了闸门的急流，冲散了一切怀疑和非难，真正进入了每个人的心。
            根深叶茂
    6月里的一天，我们在车间里见到了总支书记，看到两只炉子上工人使用新的操作技术的情形，总支书记意味深长地说，事情还没有完哩。新技术推广到生产中去了，工人很高兴，开始用得过头了，出了点小毛病；发现后，纠正得又过头了，效果也差了些。工人说，这是使用上的“左”、“右”摇摆。但是，尽管有这些曲折，在群众中真正生了根的东西，是经受得了任何考验了。虽然新技术使用中还不断发现问题，可是埋怨新技术会缩短炉子寿命，会出事故的议论却很少听到了。现在，干部、工人、技术人员共同关心的是：如何更好地发挥新技术的作用，把生产搞得更好。工人们更表现出热爱新事物的巨大热情，他们从使用中不断摸索着操作规律，以坚强的意志征服使用过程中出现的种种困难，驾驭着新技术乘风破浪前进。
