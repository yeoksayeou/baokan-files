Czech chemists have recently solved an important problem in polymer chemistry: direct casting polymerization from caprolactam. This new processing and forming method is considered a revolutionary innovation in the technology of producing polyamide castings, creating convenient conditions for the widespread use of this plastic to replace non-ferrous metals in the machinery manufacturing industry.

Using this method, caprolactam can be directly made into finished nylon-6 polyamide products through casting polymerization. The success of this new method is due to the use of new catalysts in the alkaline polymerization of caprolactam, which greatly increases the reaction rate (approximately a thousand times) and enables the polymerization to take place at temperatures below the melting point of polyamide.

Up to now, castings made by methods used worldwide (injection molding) have had pores, while the new method can produce complete, integral castings. The old method could only produce small products. The new method can manufacture products of almost unlimited size and form. Castings weighing thirty kilograms have already been made in the laboratory.

Another great benefit of this new method is that products such as bevel gears and bearings can be made directly in their final form, greatly reducing the time required to manufacture castings and finished products. In the past, it took about forty hours to manufacture final products like gears and bearings weighing less than two hundred grams. The new method can produce final products of virtually unlimited size in just thirty minutes.

    为塑料代替有色金属创立条件
    捷创造塑料铸件聚合方法
    捷克斯洛伐克化学家最近解决了高分子化学一个重要问题，直接从己内醯胺进行铸件聚合。这种新的加工成型方法被认为是生产聚醯胺铸件技术方面的一个革命性创举，为在机械制造业中广泛采用这种塑料来代替有色金属创立了便利条件。
    使用这种方法可以把己内醯胺通过铸件聚合直接制成尼隆六型聚醯胺成品。这种新方法之所以成功是由于在己内醯胺的碱性聚合中使用了新的触媒，大大地增加了反应速率（约一千倍），并使聚合作用能够在低于聚醯胺的熔点的温度下进行。
    到目前为止，世界各地所沿用的方法（注入成型）制成的铸件都有孔洞，而用新方法则可以制成完好的整体铸件。老方法只能制成小型产品。而新方法却能够制造大小和形式几乎不受限制的产品。现在三十公斤重的铸件已经在实验室中制成了。
    这种新方法的另外一个很大的好处是，能够直接以最后形式制成产品，如钝齿轮、轴承等，大大地减少了为制造铸件和成品所需要的时间。过去制造二百克以下的齿轮、轴承之类的最后成品大约需要四十个小时，新方法制成大小实际上无限的最后成品只要三十分钟。
