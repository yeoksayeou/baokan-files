	Bury Yourself in Hard Work
	Kong Sang
	July has begun, and the third quarter has begun. Time has moved forward a step, and we must throw ourselves into a new battle with renewed vigor.

	Opening today's newspaper, news from steel plants across the country tells us two things. First, the steel front has taken magnificent strides and is advancing victoriously; second, the steel front is taking solid measures to vigorously grasp equipment maintenance and vigorously grasp ore reserves. In a word, steel workers are working with full energy and burying themselves in hard work, striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

	In the first half of the year, many enterprises completed half of their annual plans ahead of schedule, breaking the usual rules of industrial production over the years and laying a good foundation for a greater and better leap forward in the second half of the year. To advance victoriously in the second half of the year, the tasks we face are even more arduous; the rate of production growth must be greater than in the first half of the year, the quality requirements of products must be higher, and the variety must be more complete; technological innovation must solve major problems and gnaw at "hard bones"; to consolidate, promote, and improve the results of innovation, we must do more detailed ideological work and organizational work; the growth of production capacity requires more raw materials; enterprise management must keep up with the development of production and mass movements, and so on.

	This situation requires us to continue to muster our energy, not only to fully estimate the favorable conditions in all aspects and earnestly summarize the rich experience of the first half of the year, but also to recognize the arduous tasks we face; neither slackening and complacency, nor discouragement and fear of difficulties.

	This situation requires us to do our work in all aspects more deeply, more meticulously, and more comprehensively than in the first half of the year.

	In a word, the situation requires us to be down-to-earth and bury ourselves in hard work. We must combine our lofty aspirations with perseverance and a spirit of hard work and practical work.

	We need to do this for the continuous leap forward in the second half of the year. We must do this even more in order to change our country's poor and blank state as soon as possible. As the old saying goes, "A man without energy, I do not know what he can do." Over the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our economy has achieved unprecedented high-speed development. However, our steel production is still less than that of some capitalist countries, the variety of some products is not yet complete, and the economic foundation is not yet strong enough. Precisely because of this, we must strive with a hundredfold effort to change our country's "poor and blank" face as soon as possible.

	In order to accelerate this process, every minute and every second is precious to us. Let us all have such ambition to win the victory in July, to win the victory in the third quarter, and to win the overall continuous leap forward in 1960!

    埋头苦干
    孔桑
    7月份开始了，第三季度开始了。时间前进了一步，我们要用新的干劲投入新的战斗。
    打开今天的报纸，来自全国各钢厂的消息告诉我们两件事。一、钢铁战线迈开了雄壮的步伐，正在乘胜猛进；二、钢铁战线正在用扎实的措施，狠抓设备维修，狠抓矿石储备。一句话，钢铁职工正在鼓足干劲，埋头苦干，力争更大更好更全面的跃进。
    上半年，许多企业提前完成了全年计划的一半，打破了历年来工业生产的常规，为下半年更大更好的跃进打下了良好的基础。下半年要乘胜前进，我们面临的任务是更加艰巨了；生产增长的幅度要比上半年更大，产品的质量要求更高，品种更全；技术革新要解决重大的问题，要啃“硬骨头”；巩固、推广、提高革新成果，要做更加细致的思想工作和组织工作；生产能力的增长需要更多的原料材料；企业管理要及时跟上生产和群众运动的发展，如此等等。
    这种形势要求我们，必须继续鼓足干劲，既充分估计到各方面的有利条件，认真总结上半年的丰富经验，又要认清我们面临的艰巨任务；既不松劲自满，又不自馁畏难。
    这种形势要求我们，各方面的工作要比上半年做得更加深入、更加细致、更加全面。
    一句话，形势要求我们，必须踏踏实实，埋头苦干。要把满怀的雄心壮志和坚韧不拔的毅力、苦干实干的精神结合起来。
    为了下半年的持续跃进，我们需要这样做。为了尽早改变我国一穷二白的状况，我们更要这样做。古语说：“人而无气，不知其可也”。建国十年来，我国的经济取得了史无前例的高速度的发展。但是，现在我们的钢还比一些资本主义国家少，一些产品的品种还不全，经济基础还不够雄厚。正因为这样，我们才更要以百倍的努力，来争取尽快地改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。
    为了加快这种进程，每一分每一秒钟，对我们都是宝贵的。我们大家要以这样的志气，夺取7月份的胜利，夺取三季度的胜利，夺取1960年全面的持续跃进！
