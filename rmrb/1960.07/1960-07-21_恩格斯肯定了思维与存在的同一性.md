Engels Affirmed the Identity of Thinking and Being
Ai Siqi

(I)

In the old society, there was a superstition that some people were possessed by ghosts, and the things they used were also considered "unclean." These things became taboo, and if you touched them, you would be tainted with ghostly energy.

The debate in philosophical circles about the "identity of thinking and being" sometimes reminds me of the above superstition. In this debate, some comrades, represented by Comrade Yu Shicheng, firmly deny any identity between thinking and being. Some of them put forward so-called reasons: the identity of thinking and being is a term used historically by idealists, and it has been tainted with the unclean air of idealism, so people should absolutely not apply it outside the meaning of idealism; whoever wants to apply it in this way is in fact propagating idealism. Therefore, materialists must firmly deny the identity of thinking and being.

We cannot agree with this view of Comrade Shicheng and others. We believe that although idealists have historically used the term "identity of thinking and being," it does not prevent us from affirming it from the standpoint of dialectical materialism. Affirming the identity of thinking and being does not equal directly affirming the principles of idealism. Because the idealism of idealism lies first in affirming that thinking is primary and being is secondary. Does it mean that as soon as we talk about "the identity of thinking and being," we are directly affirming the primacy of thinking and the secondariness of being? Obviously, these are two different things. Although there can be a connection between the two, they cannot be simply equated. Therefore, many comrades opposed the views of Comrade Shicheng and others and put forward criticisms, and I think their criticisms are correct.

The key lies in how to understand "identity." There are two fundamentally opposite understandings here: one is the metaphysical understanding, which Engels called abstract identity, that is, understanding identity as the absolute identity of things with themselves. This means that the same thing never contains any inherent difference, opposition, or contradiction. Conversely, anything with difference, opposition, or contradiction can never be the same. Identity is simply equivalence. When the identity of thinking and being is understood in this sense, two absurd results may be obtained: either the vulgar materialism that Engels criticized, if thinking is simply equated with some special substance, such as equating it with the bile secreted by the liver; or idealism, if being is simply equated with thinking. General idealists, especially subjective idealists, actually understand identity in this way when dealing with the relationship between thinking and being. According to this view, there is no truly material objective existence in the world, and everything that exists around us as matter can only be reduced to the internal existence of human thinking, consciousness, feeling, and other spirits. Of course, we should firmly oppose these views. If someone explains identity in this way and applies this understanding to the relationship between thinking and being, saying: "Thinking and being are the same," then we must sharply raise objections to him, saying: "You are completely wrong, there is no such identity between thinking and being!"

There is another understanding of identity, that is, the dialectical understanding. According to this understanding, identity is the identity of difference, the identity of opposition, or the identity of contradiction. Or, the same thing contains differences, oppositions, or contradictions within itself; difference and opposition have their identity under certain conditions. Such identity mainly refers to the sense of mutual connection and mutual transformation between the two sides of the opposition under certain conditions. For example, without the proletariat, there could be no bourgeoisie, and without the bourgeoisie, there would be no proletariat. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are interconnected under the capitalist system, and the two have identity. For example, war is transformed into peace under certain conditions, and peace is transformed into war under certain conditions. The two have identity under certain conditions. It should be pointed out here that, according to the dialectical understanding, the category of "identity" has the same meaning as "unity" and "agreement." Marxists-Leninists believe that the metaphysical understanding of identity is one-sided and cannot reflect the essence of objective things, while the dialectical understanding of identity correctly reflects the most universal law of objective things. There is no thing in the world that is absolutely identical to itself and does not contain any inherent differences and contradictions; any unified thing contains differences and oppositions within itself. On the other hand, all differences and oppositions are interconnected and mutually transformed under certain conditions, and therefore have identity under such conditions. The identity of opposites is the source of movement and change of things. The opposing aspects within things are both identical and struggling, promoting the development of things forward. Such identity, which is inextricably linked with difference and opposition in the process of development of things, is dialectical identity, or the identity of contradiction. Marxists-Leninists are thorough dialecticians and believe that dialectical laws exist in all things. Therefore, identity in the dialectical sense should be applied to any thing without exception, including the relationship between thinking and being. Thinking is a reflection of being, and thinking can become a guiding force for people to transform the world and promote the change and development of objective being under certain conditions. The relationship of mutual connection and mutual transformation between the two is very obvious. Therefore, if someone asks: Is there an identity in the dialectical sense between thinking and being? A thorough dialectic supporter will definitely answer without hesitation: The identity of thinking and being definitely exists!

Comrades who deny any identity between thinking and being, such as Comrade Shicheng, are not completely without contact with the question of how to understand identity. He himself has in fact admitted that the reason why the "identity of thinking and being" has become a proposition of idealism is precisely because idealists have given this term a metaphysical explanation that being is equivalent to thinking. In an article in Guangming Daily on March 4th and 5th of this year, he said: "The identity of idealism, it says 'this is that, that is this, thinking is being, being is thinking.' In Berkeley's words, it refers to 'object and feeling are the same thing'." What do these words mean? It shows that the proposition of "the identity of thinking and being" is not inherently with the absolute nature of idealism. It only takes on such a nature because idealists use the viewpoint of "this is that, that is this," and the viewpoint of equating the object with feeling, to treat the relationship between the two. Such a viewpoint is precisely a metaphysical viewpoint. If Comrade Shicheng starts from what he said and further asks the question according to normal and reasonable logic, if people do not use the metaphysical viewpoint of "this is that, that is this" to view the identity of thinking and being, but regard the two as the identity of contradiction, the identity of opposition, and point out that this contradiction and opposition is based on matter and being, matter and being are primary, and spirit and consciousness are secondary, can we still say that "the identity of thinking and being" is a proposition of idealism in this sense? Can we still deny that there is a certain identity between thinking and being? It is very clear that in this sense, we cannot say that "the identity of thinking and being" is still a proposition of idealism, and we cannot simply deny the identity of thinking and being.

(II)

We have pointed out the errors of Comrade Shicheng and others above in principle. Comrade Shicheng and those who have the same views may think that their views are not based on empty assumptions, and it also has a strong basis; this basis is first of all Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." Didn't Lenin, when criticizing Bogdanov's "theory of the identity of social being and social consciousness," be filled with angry emotions and denounced it as "utter nonsense" and "absolutely reactionary theory (Complete Works of Lenin, Chinese version, Volume 14, pages 342-343)? Didn't Lenin ever quote this passage from Lafargue—"When Rappoport insists that Marx believes that 'there is an identity between ideas and reality,' he is wrong" (ibid., page 209)—? Didn't Lenin strictly point out that when using the Russian word "совладать" (consistent) in the relationship between sensory representation and the reality outside us, it should be interpreted as "conform" and "coordinate" instead of "identity" (ibid., page 111)? True, there are such "bases" in Lenin's works, and Comrade Shicheng and others are relying on these "bases" to demonstrate the correctness of their views. Therefore, we must study whether these "bases" in Lenin's book can prove the correctness of the views of Comrade Shicheng and others?

If we do not quote classic works out of context, if we seriously study the essence of the problem, we can see that Lenin's thoughts are not the same as the views of Comrade Shicheng and others.

The key issue is still how to understand the concept of identity. Why did Lenin criticize "the identity of thinking and being" from beginning to end in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism"? The reason is that Lenin was facing a large number of subjective idealists at that time, some of whom wanted to "revise" Marxist philosophy with subjective idealism. These subjective idealists universally raised the magic weapon of "the identity of consciousness and being" and gave it a metaphysical explanation: "This is that, that is this." In order to defend dialectical materialism, Lenin had to smash their magic weapon and conduct a merciless struggle against their understanding of the proposition of "the identity of consciousness and being." It is not difficult to see that Lenin's criticism of "the identity of consciousness and being" in his works is all directed at identity in the metaphysical sense. Lenin never exaggerated the meaning of "the identity of consciousness and being" one-sidedly when criticizing "the identity of consciousness and being," to the extent that any identity between consciousness and being outside the metaphysical meaning is denied. No, Lenin, while criticizing subjective idealists for distorting the relationship between consciousness and being with the viewpoint of metaphysical identity, also paid attention to preventing thinking from being led to another metaphysical extreme, that is, regarding the relationship between consciousness and being as an absolute opposition, as an absolute difference that is not contained in any identity. The following words are good evidence:

"Of course, even the opposition of matter and consciousness has absolute significance only within a very limited scope; here, it is only absolute within the scope of recognizing what is primary and what is secondary, this basic question of epistemology. Beyond this scope, the opposition of matter and consciousness is undoubtedly relative." (Ibid., page 148)

It also said: —

"The idea that Dietzgen did not express correctly is: the difference between matter and spirit is relative, not infinite." (Ibid., page 257)

Lenin tells us here that consciousness and matter are only without any identity in the question of what is primary and what is secondary, that is, within the scope of the first aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy that Engels said. Outside the scope of this question, there is only a relative opposition or difference between them, which means that there is an identity of difference or an identity of opposition between them.

Why did Lenin angrily denounce Bogdanov's "theory of the identity of social being and social consciousness"? Could it be that it was because Bogdanov advocated the kind of opposing identity affirmed by historical materialism between social being and social consciousness, that is, social being determines consciousness and social consciousness in turn can actively promote the development of social being? Of course not. The problem is that the "identity" mentioned by Bogdanov is a completely metaphysical and abstract identity, without the slightest flavor of dialectics. What made Lenin unable to not be angry was his set of fallacies: "All kinds of social life are the life of consciousness—psychology...Sociality and consciousness are inseparable. Society is the same as social consciousness, in the precise meaning of these two words." (Ibid., page 340) May I ask, facing such nonsense, could a true Marxist easily tolerate it without rising up to give it a severe rebuke? The reason why Lenin wanted to rebuke it was because Bogdanov simply equated social being with social consciousness. Lenin here did not in any way want to deny the dialectical identity between consciousness and being.

Does Lafargue's words quoted by Lenin help our Comrade Shicheng? No either. If you look carefully at the context before and after that quoted sentence, it is not difficult to find that it is another matter. First of all, it should be noted that when Lafargue denied "Rappoport insisted that Marx believed that 'there is an identity between ideas and reality'," the reason he put forward was "we never use such metaphysical terms." That is to say, because Rappoport is a neo-Kantian, he himself opposes ideas and reality metaphysically, regarding ideas as fiction, as things without any reality; in his opinion, to talk about the identity of ideas and reality is to equate ideas with reality completely, and it means "ideas are equal to all reality," "there is no other reality besides ideas." The understanding of identity in this sense is naturally fundamentally different from the views of Marxists. Marxists believe that in addition to people's subjective ideas, there are also material objects, and it cannot be said that only ideas are reality. Material objects are also reality, and a more fundamental reality. It should be noted that Lafargue has the following paragraph immediately after saying the above: "Ideas, like objects, are also real, they are a reflection of the object in the mind." (Ibid., page 209) It is very clear here that the "real" things not only include ideas, but also objects outside of ideas. Therefore, Lafargue's words actually contain two aspects: first, ideas and objects are two different things, and they cannot be equated metaphysically. Second, there is a dialectical identity, an identity of difference, between ideas and objects, because they are both "real," and they cannot be opposed metaphysically.

If Comrade Shicheng believes that Lafargue's words are not clear enough, then you can look at another passage from a materialist also quoted by Lenin: "...For materialists, it is completely redundant to distinguish between a priori knowledge and 'things-in-themselves,' because materialists have never cut off the constant connection in nature anywhere, and have never regarded matter and spirit as fundamentally different things, but believe that they are just two aspects of the same thing. ..."(Ibid., page 208) The materialist who said this was a follower of Feuerbach and not yet a dialectical materialist, but his passage was endorsed by Lenin. Metaphysical materialists naturally cannot apply dialectics in epistemology, but it is not impossible for their works to have individual (and extremely incomplete) dialectical factors. For example, this passage affirms the identity of the difference between thinking and being, affirming that they are two aspects of the "same" thing.

Comrade Shicheng, in an article published in Guangming Daily on October 11th of last year, firmly denied the contradictory identity between thinking and being, denied the inseparable connection between the two, and denied that "thinking and being, these two aspects, under certain conditions, are mutually conditional and coexist in a unified whole," insisting that such a view is a "idealist theory" of "principle monism." Comrade Shicheng considers himself to be a person who supports dialectical materialism, but in fact this statement is far behind Feuerbachians—metaphysical materialism! Because the Feuerbachian follower quoted by Lenin clearly affirms the inseparable "constant connection" between thinking and being, affirming that "these two aspects" "coexist in a unified whole." Of course, Feuerbach criticized the idealists' "identity of thinking and being" in his "Principles of the Philosophy of the Future," but the reason why he criticized it was because it regarded being as "an existence that is not different from thinking, an existence that only exists as an attribute of reason" (Chinese version, page 42), because it regarded identity as "the identity of thinking with itself." Feuerbach affirmed "the unity of thinking and being" in the same book (see the Chinese version of the book, page 74) and gave it a materialistic explanation. Feuerbach's materialism is passive reflection theory in epistemology, which has a fundamental difference from Marx's and Lenin's active reflection theory, and some comrades have made detailed criticisms of its major shortcomings, and their criticisms are correct, and I will not repeat their opinions. I only want to point out here that, because Feuerbach does not understand dialectics, he himself does not know that when he talks about "the unity of thinking and being," he has in fact recognized the identity of difference between the two. And this is enough to show that even metaphysical materialism affirms the inseparable connection between thinking and being on the basis of general reflection theory, affirming the identity of difference between them, otherwise it will not become materialism, and it will become dualism or agnosticism.

Speaking of this, we can easily understand the problem of the Russian word "совладать": Why did Lenin insist on using it in the sense of "conform" and "coordinate" and oppose using it in the sense of "identity"? It is necessary to know that Lenin's analysis was specifically aimed at the sophistry of the empirio-criticist Bazarov. Bazarov used the double meaning of this Russian word—"consistency" and "identity"—to distort the sentence "the representation of things and their properties is consistent with the reality that exists outside us" into "sensory representation is also (the emphasis is added by Bazarov) the reality that exists outside us" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Chinese version, Volume 14, page 110). What Lenin opposed here was Bazarov's distortion of "consistency" into metaphysical "identity," and did not deny the dialectical identity between "the representation of things and their properties and the reality that exists outside us"—there is no difference between dialectical "identity" and "consistency"—this is very clear.

(III)

Comrades who deny that there is any identity between thinking and being believe that their views can also be found in Engels. Their reason is that when Engels talked about "the question of the identity of thinking and being" in his book "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," his words were borrowed from Hegel, and he treated it only as an idealist proposition, that is to say, he treated the question of the identity of thinking and being with a negative attitude. These comrades also said: When Lenin quoted this relevant passage from Engels in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," he especially deleted the sentence "In philosophical language, this question is called the question of the identity of thinking and being," as if this was enough to prove that Lenin also believed that Engels denied the identity of thinking and being.

These statements are very far-fetched.

Can saying that "the question of the identity of thinking and being" was borrowed from Hegel's works be a sufficient reason to prove that "the identity of thinking and being" can only have an idealist meaning? Marxists borrowed more than this one language from Hegel's works. For example, "negation of negation" is Hegel's term. This term has its shortcomings, but Marxists-Leninists have borrowed it, and no one can say that it is only an idealist term. Hegel's philosophy has two aspects: one aspect is idealistic, and the other aspect is dialectics—suffocated by the idealistic system, extremely incomplete, but the most conscious dialectics compared to the philosophy before Hegel. Marxists-Leninists take a completely negative attitude towards Hegel's idealism, while inheriting its rational core on its dialectical aspect, and reforming and developing it. The same is true for the question of the identity of thinking and being. The idea of the identity of thinking and being in Hegel's philosophy also has two aspects. Regarding the first aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy, Hegel regards thinking as the first, and explains the identity of thinking and being as the meaning of "being is thinking", and explains being as "an existence that is not different from thinking," so it is given an idealist meaning. Regarding the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy, Hegel and the vast majority of other philosophers (including all materialists and thorough idealists) affirmatively answered the question of "whether thinking can know the real world," and gave a dialectical explanation of the relationship between thinking and being to a certain extent when criticizing Kant's agnosticism. In this aspect, Hegel's idea of "the identity of thinking and being" has its rational, that is, dialectical, component, and is not just an idealist proposition.

It should be noted that Engels's works do not discuss the question of the identity of thinking and being from the first aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy, but raise this question on the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy. The second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy is not to solve the question of dividing materialism or idealism, but to solve the question of whether the real world is knowable to human thinking. On this aspect of the problem, affirming the knowability of the real world is to affirm the identity of thinking and being. Although the affirmation of materialists and the affirmation of idealists have fundamentally different directions, it is very clear that they all affirm the knowability of the world and affirm the identity of thinking and being in terms of opposing agnosticism. When Engels raised this question, his direct object of criticism was not idealism, but agnosticism. The quotation of "the identity of thinking and being" was also to criticize the Kantian thought that did not recognize any identity between thinking and being. Therefore, in terms of the task of struggle, it is obvious that Engels must give an affirmative solution to the question of the identity of thinking and being. Moreover, even if we look only at the grammatical order, in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," after raising the question "Can our thinking know the real world? Can we form a correct reflection of reality in our representations and concepts about the real world?" it immediately points out that "In philosophical language, this question is called the question of the identity of thinking and being"; and then immediately replies, "The vast majority of philosophers have solved this problem affirmatively." Such a word order also shows that Engels clearly believed that materialists (including those within the "vast majority" of philosophers) also gave an affirmative answer to the question of "the identity of thinking and being," and it is very far-fetched to make the opposite interpretation of this point.

When Lenin quoted this passage from Engels in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," he also pointed out that the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy does not directly solve the question of the division between idealism and materialism. Lenin said: "Engels divides philosophers into 'two major camps' based on this basic question, and then he points out that the basic question of philosophy 'also has another aspect'..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 14, page 94) It is very clear here that what the second aspect of the basic question of philosophy wants to solve is another question after the division of "two major camps," and in this aspect, the affirmative or negative solution to "the question of the identity of thinking and being" will not directly involve the boundary question of idealism or materialism.

Comrade Shicheng said that "Lenin deleted the sentence 'In philosophical language, this question is called the question of the identity of thinking and being' in this quotation, which is enough to prove that Lenin also believed that Engels denied the identity of thinking and being." In fact, the logic of things is exactly the opposite of Comrade Shicheng's subjective estimation. If Lenin determined that Engels denied the question of "the identity of thinking and being," then he would not only not delete this sentence, but he would definitely quote it. Because Lenin was fighting with a large number of subjective idealists, and these reactionary thoughts used the metaphysical explanation of "the identity of thinking and being" as their weapon, and Lenin was doing his best to deal with this weapon. If Engels's works had already denied the identity of thinking and being, then Lenin needed to quote his words as a powerful basis for helping to disarm idealism.

The fact that Lenin deleted this sentence is enough to show that when Engels talked about "the identity of thinking and being," it was not for the sake of criticizing idealism, but for the sake of solving another problem, and it was not necessary to quote it for Lenin's task of struggle.

People may ask: Engels and Lenin were both Marxists, and their views are of course consistent, how can they have different attitudes on the same issue? People who raise such questions are due to not paying attention to the historical development process. Marxism is a historical science, and it is necessary to study problems according to historical circumstances. Engels and Lenin were in different historical periods, and their specific tasks of struggle were also different. Although they seem to be touching on the same issue in form, what they actually want to solve are different issues. In the period before Engels's death, the main slogan of bourgeois reactionary philosophical thought was "Return to Kant," and Hegel was to be treated as a "dead dog." Its purpose was to spread Kantian agnosticism, to spread the fallacy that there is absolutely no identity between thinking and being, to spread the fallacy that people's thoughts and concepts cannot know objective reality, but are merely subjective fictions, to belittle reason, belittle science, and oppose science. At this time, the revisionists who appeared in the workers' movement, such as Bernstein and Schmidt, followed behind the bourgeois professors, vainly attempting to "revise" Marxism with Kant's agnosticism, to belittle the scientific nature of Marxism. Facing such bourgeois reactionary trends of thought, including revisionist trends of thought, Engels had to focus on solving the problem of the dialectics of cognition, solving the problem of whether the real world is knowable or unknowable. Because the Kantianists (including revisionists) at that time were frantically attacking Hegel, mainly targeting their dialectics, not their idealism, both Marx and Engels had repeatedly emphasized the rational factors of Hegel's dialectics in their own works, although they also pointed out at the same time that Hegel's dialectics and their dialectics have fundamental differences. When Engels discussed "the question of the identity of thinking and being" in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," it was for the purpose of criticizing the Kantian, unknowable fallacy that denied any identity between thinking and being. In order to crush such an opponent, naturally, he had to affirm "the identity of thinking and being," affirm Hegel's rational dialectical factors in answering this question, but also criticize Hegel's idealistic argument on this question.

Lenin was in another period—the imperialist period of capitalism. At this time, the mainstream of bourgeois reactionary philosophical thought developed into a subjective idealism that was a hundred times more corrupt, and the revisionists also smiled obsequiously and followed behind the bourgeois professors, "revising" Marxist philosophy with various shades of subjective idealism. They spread the nonsense that consciousness and being are absolutely identical, and denied the objective existence of the external world, denied the objectivity of scientific laws, and denied the scientific reality of Marxist doctrine through the sophistry of "consciousness is being" and "being is consciousness." Faced with this reactionary philosophical trend of thought that was rampant everywhere, Lenin had to focus on solving the problem of strictly dividing materialism and idealism, solving the problem of the party spirit of materialist philosophy, and had to resolutely crush the metaphysical nonsense of the main weapon of idealism—the identity of thinking and being—without leaving it any room for existence. However, it would be a big mistake to interpret Lenin's spirit of resolute struggle against the metaphysical identity fallacy of consciousness and being as Lenin denying any identity between consciousness and being, as Lenin viewing consciousness and being as absolutely opposed things.

Engels' affirmative attitude towards "the identity of thinking and being" can also be significantly proven from his letter to Schmidt. This is the letter of 1895 mentioned by Comrade Shicheng, but Comrade Shicheng completely read the meaning of that letter as its opposite. He thought that Engels's letter helped him, but it was exactly the opposite. What Engels criticized in that letter was Schmidt's mistaken view of "degrading the law of value into a necessary fiction." This is precisely the Kantian fallacy of denying the identity of thinking and being, and denying that people's ideas about the law of value reflect the economic laws of the objective world. If we assume that Engels, when criticizing the mistaken views of Kantianists who deny the identity of thinking and being, himself stood with the Kantianists to oppose Hegel, and clearly pointed out that "thinking and being are not the same" (words from Comrade Shicheng's article in Guangming Daily on October 11th last year), wouldn't that be too strange?

Let's read the paragraph of Engels's text that Comrade Shicheng calls "clearly pointing out that 'thinking and being are not the same'" again carefully! Is its meaning really as he imagined? Engels said: "Your criticism of the law of value applies to all concepts from a realistic point of view. In Hegel's words, the identity of thinking and being is perfectly suited to the example of circles and polygons that you cited. In other words, the concept of things and the reality of things are moving simultaneously, like two asymptotes, constantly approaching each other, but will never meet. This difference between the two is precisely the difference that makes the concept not directly become reality and reality not directly become the concept of itself. Concepts have the nature of concepts, so they do not directly coincide with reality, although they must initially be abstracted from reality; for this reason, concepts are still not fiction, unless you say that all the results of thinking are fiction, because the conformity of reality to the results of thinking is only in a very indirect and roundabout way, or even just asymptotic proximity."

This is copied verbatim according to what Comrade Shicheng quoted. Comrade Shicheng determined that this quotation denies the identity of thinking and being, but he did not say a single reason. Now let us explain why the content of Engels's paragraph is completely opposite to Comrade Shicheng's view. Let's start with the example of the relationship between polygons and circles. The laws of geometry tell us that the result of an equilateral polygon with infinitely increasing sides will approach a circle; this law shows that a polygon can be transformed into a circle, and there is a dialectical identity between the two. The Kantianist Schmidt denied this identity, and attempted to use this as a metaphor to deny the identity of thinking and being. His reason was: although a polygon can approach a circle, it is not a circle after all, and although thinking and concepts can approach being and reality, they are not being and reality after all, but just fiction. This paragraph from Engels precisely refutes Schmidt's unknowable viewpoint of metaphysically and absolutely opposing thinking and being, concepts and reality. He pointed out that the principle of the identity of thinking and being is not inapplicable to Schmidt's example of circles and polygons (as Schmidt thought), but "perfectly suited" to this example. The dialectical identity of circles and polygons is also perfect to use as a metaphor to illustrate the relationship between thinking and being, concepts and reality. The identity of concepts and reality lies first in the fact that the two are moving simultaneously, constantly approaching each other like asymptotes, and the concept "must initially be abstracted from reality." But this identity is not metaphysical absolute equivalence, and there are always differences between the two; concepts will never "directly" become reality, and thinking and being will never "directly" coincide. It should be pointed out: saying that concepts and thinking cannot "directly" become reality does not negate, but affirms that they can indirectly, under certain conditions, transform into reality and transform into being through some medium. Marx said, "Once theory grasps the masses, it will become a material force." China's socialist construction, due to the implementation of the general line and the principle of putting politics in command, has promoted a high-speed development in real life in the form of a "Great Leap Forward." These examples vividly illustrate how concepts and thinking are indirectly transformed into real existence through certain links, illustrating that "concepts are still not fiction," and that thinking and being still have identity. Therefore, it also crushed the Kantian metaphysical viewpoint that regards concepts as fiction and denies the identity of thinking and being. (Incidentally, the center of gravity of the original text of Engels's paragraph is placed on affirming the sentence "concepts are still not fiction." The translation did not fully and accurately convey his meaning.) Naturally, the identity of thinking and being is a dialectical identity, and the approach and conformity of the two is indirect and roundabout, or even just asymptotic. Metaphysical materialists do not understand this dialectical process, and they believe that thinking should reflect reality completely and correctly at once, which is also incorrect.

(IV)

In short, the view of Comrade Shicheng and others denying the identity of thinking and being is wrong, because they have forgotten that there are two different understandings of identity, metaphysical and dialectical, and that dialectical identity exists universally in all things, and also exists in the relationship between thinking and being.

When idealists, especially subjective idealists, explain identity from a metaphysical point of view, distorting "the identity of consciousness and being" into "being is equivalent to consciousness," and distorting being into "an existence that is not different from thinking," Marxists-Leninists, in order to criticize idealism and refute their metaphysical distortion, must resolutely deny this identity of consciousness and being in a tit-for-tat manner. But when criticizing agnosticism, they must affirm the identity of thinking and being, because agnostics attempt to deny the dialectical identity between them.

Denying that there is any identity between thinking and being, denying the "inseparable connection" between the two, and denying that they "under certain conditions, are mutually conditional and coexist in a unified whole," like Comrade Shicheng, will approach the agnostic viewpoint of Kantianism, or even if they have not completely become agnosticism, but because they do not recognize the dialectical connection and mutual transformation relationship between thinking and being, and because they cannot apply dialectics in epistemology, they will still fall into the one-sidedness of metaphysical materialism.

In the past, Plekhanov was in a state of self-contradiction and confusion on some fundamental issues when he was struggling with the Kantianists—revisionists—precisely because he did not understand the dialectics of cognition and did not understand the dialectical identity of thinking and being. Plekhanov played a certain positive role in the struggle against revisionism, but when Bernstein, Schmidt and others used sophistry to confuse the materialist's understanding of the identity of thinking and being with the idealist's understanding, insisting that "pure materialism will ultimately lead to idealism," Plekhanov not only dared not refute it from the front in the face of this reactionary thought's offensive, but also clearly affirmed that materialism affirmed the identity of thinking and being on a basis different from idealism, like Engels. On the contrary, he flatly denied the identity of thinking and being, and even said that "only idealism recognizes the identity of thinking and being." Thorough Marxists-Leninists—dialectical materialists—would not make such a one-sided judgment. Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" relentlessly criticizes the idealistic fallacy of "the identity of consciousness and being" from beginning to end, but throughout this work, you will never find such a one-sided and absolute conclusion as "only idealists recognize the identity of thinking and being." However, despite the fact that such one-sided and absolute conclusions appeared in Plekhanov's article, in another article of his, he could not help but slap himself in the face logically, affirming that "we can and should say the identity of the conceptual thing and the material thing" in the sense that "the conceptual thing" can correctly conform to "the material thing." ("Against Revisionism in Philosophy," page 156) Although the meaning he said is still one-sided, and does not refer to the dialectical meaning of the mutual connection and mutual transformation of the conceptual thing and the material thing.

In his "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin pointed out that Plekhanov did not understand the dialectics of epistemology, and therefore his materialism often manifested itself as metaphysical and vulgar materialism. In "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin also criticized Plekhanov's "hieroglyphic theory" viewpoint, revealing its agnostic erroneous nature. These errors of Plekhanov were not accidental. It shows that if you cannot apply dialectics in epistemology, and you do not understand the dialectical identity of thinking and being, it is possible to lead people onto the road against Marxism-Leninism.

The question of the identity of thinking and being has historically been an important issue involved in the struggle between Marxists-Leninists and revisionism—bourgeois idealism. In this struggle, Engels and Lenin defended the epistemology of materialism and defended dialectics. Today, our study of Engels' and Lenin's thoughts on the identity of thinking and being not only has great theoretical significance, but also has extremely important practical significance. Modern revisionists are also destroying materialist epistemology and dialectics everywhere in the field of ideology. Correctly solving the question of the identity of thinking and being is conducive to our struggle against revisionism. At the same time, in order to correctly understand the laws of China's socialist construction, it is also necessary to study this issue well. The magnificent Great Leap Forward situation and the people's commune movement that have appeared in China in the past two years show how correctly the guiding ideology of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong—the guiding ideology centered on the general line of socialist construction—correctly reflects the objective laws of the socialist practice of hundreds of millions of people, and how this correct guiding ideology transforms into overwhelming material forces through the mass movement of the broad masses of the people. This fully embodies the law of mutual conditioning and mutual transformation of thinking and being, and fully embodies the unprecedented brilliant typical example of the law of dialectical identity between them. If you do not understand dialectical identity of thinking

    恩格斯肯定了思维与存在的同一性
    艾思奇
    （一）
    旧社会有这样一种迷信：某些人有鬼附在身上，他们使用过的东西，也被认为是“不洁”的。这些东西就成为禁忌之物，如果你接触它们，那么，你的身上也就要染上鬼气了。
    哲学界关于“思维与存在的同一性”问题的争论，有时使我联想到上述的迷信。在这次争论中，以于世诚同志为代表的一些同志们，坚决否认思维与存在之间有任何的同一性。他们中间有些人提出了所谓的理由：思维与存在的同一性是在历史上被唯心主义者所使用的术语，它已经沾上了唯心主义的不洁之气，因此人们就绝对不能在唯心主义的意义之外来应用它；谁要想这样来应用它，谁就是在事实上宣传了唯心主义。因此，唯物主义者就必须坚决否认思维与存在的同一性。
    我们不能同意世诚同志等人的这种看法。我们认为，尽管唯心主义者在历史上曾使用过思维与存在的同一性这个术语，但并不妨害我们在辩证唯物主义的立场上来肯定它。肯定了思维与存在的同一性，并不就等于直接肯定了唯心主义的原则。因为唯心主义之为唯心主义，首先在于肯定思维是第一性的东西，存在是第二性的东西。难道说只要一谈到“思维与存在的同一性”，就等于直接肯定了思维的第一性和存在的第二性吗？显然这是两件事情。虽然两者可以有联系，但不能简单地画上等号。因此，许多同志反对世诚同志等人的看法，并提出了批评，我认为他们的批评是对的。
    关键在于对“同一性”如何理解。这里有两种根本相反的理解：一种是形而上学的理解，恩格斯叫做抽象的同一性，即把同一性理解为事物与自身的绝对的同一，这就是说，同一的东西决不包含任何内在的差别、对立或矛盾，反过来说，凡是有差别、对立或矛盾的东西也决不能成为同一。同一就是简单的等同。在这样的意义上来理解思维与存在的同一性时，就可能得到两种荒谬结果；或者是得到恩格斯所批判过的那种庸俗唯物主义，如果把思维简单地等同于某种特殊的物质，例如等同于肝脏分泌出来的胆汁的话；或者是得到唯心主义，如果把存在简单地等同于思维的话。一般的唯心主义者，特别是主观唯心主义者，在处理思维与存在的关系时，实际上是这样来了解同一性的。按照这样的看法，世界上就没有真正物质的客观存在，一切在我们周围作为物质而存在的东西，都只能归结为人的思维、意识、感觉等精神内部的存在。当然，我们是应该坚决反对这些看法的。如果有人这样来解释同一性，并且把这样的理解应用到思维与存在的关系上，说：“思维与存在是同一的”，那我们就要针锋相对地向他提出反对的意见，说：“你完全错了，思维与存在没有这样的同一性！”
    对同一性还有另一种理解，即辩证法的理解。按照这样的理解，同一是差别的同一，对立的同一，或矛盾的同一。或者说，同一事物内部都包含着差别，对立或矛盾；差别、对立在一定条件下都有其同一性。这样的同一性，主要是指的对立面双方在一定条件下互相联系和互相转化这一个意义。例如，没有无产阶级，就不可能有资产阶级，没有资产阶级，也就不存在无产阶级，无产阶级和资产阶级在资本主义制度下互相联系，两者就有了同一性。再例如，战争在一定条件下转化为和平，和平在一定条件下又转化为战争，两者在一定条件下就有了同一性。这里应该指出，根据辩证法的理解，“同一”这个范畴，和“统一”、“一致”等的意义是相同的。马克思列宁主义者认为，同一性的形而上学的理解，是片面的，不能反映客观事物的本质，而同一性的辩证法的理解，则正确地反映了客观事物的最普遍的规律性。世界上不存在与自身绝对同一而不包含任何内在的差别和矛盾的事物；任何统一的东西都在自己内部包含着差别和对立，另一方面，一切差别和对立的东西都在一定条件下互相联系和互相转化，因而就在这样的条件下是有同一性。对立的同一性是事物运动变化的根源，事物内部相互矛盾的对立方面又同一又斗争，推动着事物向前发展。这样的意义上的同一性，在事物发展过程中与差别、对立不可分地联系着的同一性，就是辩证法的同一性，或矛盾的同一性。马克思列宁主义者是彻底辩证论者，相信辩证规律存在于一切事物之中，因此，辩证法意义上的同一性，应该毫无例外地运用于任何事物，包括思维与存在的关系在内。思维是存在的反映，思维在一定条件下又能成为人们改造世界，推动客观存在的变化和发展的指导力量，两者之间互相联系、互相转化的关系是很明显地存在着的。因此，如果有人问：思维与存在之间有没有辩证意义上的同一性？一个彻底的辩证法拥护者，一定会毫不迟疑地答复说：思维与存在的同一性是肯定地存在着的！
    对思维与存在之间的任何同一性一概加以否定的同志们，例如世诚同志，并不是完全没有接触到同一性如何理解的问题。他自己在实际上已经承认，“思维与存在的同一性”之所以成为唯心主义的命题，正是由于唯心主义者对这个术语作了存在等同于思维的形而上学的解释。他在今年光明日报3月4、5两日的一篇文章里就说：“唯心主义的同一性，它是说的‘这个即那个、那个即这个、思维即存在，存在即思维’。用贝克莱的话说，是指的‘对象和感觉是同一个东西’”。这些话说明什么呢？它说明，“思维与存在的同一性”这个命题不是生来就是有着唯心主义的绝对性质，它之所以带有这样的性质，只是由于唯心主义者用“这个即那个，那个即这个”的观点，用对象等同于感觉的观点，来看待两者之间的关系的缘故。这样的观点正是形而上学的观点。如果世诚同志从他自己所说的话出发，按照正常的合理的逻辑进一步这样提出问题说，倘若人们不是用形而上学的“这个即那个，那个即这个”的观点来看思维与存在的同一性，而是把两者看做矛盾的同一，对立的同一，并且指明这个矛盾和对立是以物质、存在作为基础的，物质、存在是第一性的，精神、意识是第二性的，在这样的意义上，难道还能说“思维与存在的同一性”是唯心主义的命题吗？难道还能否认思维与存在之间有着一定的同一性吗？很明白，在这样的意义上，就不能说“思维与存在的同一性”还是唯心主义的命题，就不能简单地否认思维与存在的同一性。
    （二）
    我们在上面从原则上指出了世诚同志等人的错误。世诚同志以及和他有同样看法的人们可能认为，他们的看法并不是出自凭空的设想，它还有着强有力的根据；这个根据首先就是列宁的《唯物主义与经验批判主义》。难道列宁在批判波格丹诺夫的“社会存在和社会意识的同一性的理论”时，不是曾经充满着愤怒的情绪，斥之为“十足的胡言乱语”、“绝对反动的理论（《列宁全集》中文版，十四卷，342—343页）吗？难道列宁不是曾经引用过拉法格的这样一段话——“当拉波波特硬说马克思认为‘存在着观念和实在的同一性’的时候，他是错误的”（同上，209页）——吗？难道列宁不曾严格地指出过：在感性表象和我们之外的现实之间的关系上使用俄文совладать　（一致）这个字时应该解释作“符合”“协调”的意义，而不应该解释作“同一”的意义吗？（同上，111页）不错，列宁的著作里的确有着这样一些“根据”，而世诚同志等人正是依靠这些“根据”来论证自己的看法的。因此我们就必须要研究一下，列宁书中的这些“根据”，是不是能够证明世诚同志等人的看法的正确性呢？
    如果我们对经典著作不作断章取义的引用，如果我们认真地研究一下问题的实质，那就可以看到，列宁的思想和世诚同志等人的看法并不是一样的。
    关键问题仍然是在于对同一性的概念如何理解。列宁为什么在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》里自始至终批判了“思维与存在的同一性”呢？原因是列宁在当时面对着一大批主观唯心主义者，其中有些人想用主观唯心主义来“修正”马克思主义哲学。这些主观唯心主义者普遍地祭起了“意识和存在的同一性”这个法宝，并对它赋予形而上学的解释：“这个即那个，那个即这个”。列宁为了捍卫辩证唯物论，必须粉碎他们的这个法宝，对他们所理解的“意识和存在的同一性”的命题进行毫不容情的斗争。不难看出，列宁在他的著作里批判“意识和存在的同一性”时，都是针对着形而上学意义上的同一性，列宁从没有在批判“意识和存在的同一性”时，把它的意义片面地加以夸大，以至对形而上学意义以外的任何意识和存在之间的同一性，也一概加以否认。不是的，列宁在批判主观唯心主义者用形而上学同一性的观点来曲解意识和存在的关系时，同时又注意到要防止把思想引到另一个形而上学的极端，即把意识和存在之间的关系看做绝对的对立，看做不包含在任何同一性中的绝对的差别。下面这些话就是很好的证据：
    “当然，就是物质和意识的对立，也只是在非常有限的范围内才有绝对的意义；在这里，仅仅是在承认什么是第一性的和什么是第二性的这个认识论的基本问题的范围内才有绝对的意义。超出这个范围，物质和意识的对立无疑是相对的。”（同上，148页）
    又说：——
    “狄慈根没有正确地表达出来的思想是：物质和精神的差别是相对的，不是无限的”。（同上，257页） 列宁在这里告诉我们，意识和物质仅仅是在什么是第一性和什么是第二性这个问题上，也就是在恩格斯所说的哲学根本问题的第一个方面的范围内，才是没有任何同一性的，在这个问题的范围之外，它们之间只有着相对的对立或差别，这也就是说，它们之间有着差别的同一性或对立的同一性。
    列宁为什么要愤怒地斥责波格达诺夫的“社会存在和社会意识的同一性的理论”呢？难道说是因为波格达诺夫主张社会存在和社会意识之间有着历史唯物主义所肯定的那种对立的同一性，即社会存在决定意识而社会意识反过来又能动地推动着社会存在的发展？当然不是的。问题在于波格达诺夫所说到的“同一性”是十足地形而上学的、抽象的同一性，丝毫也没有半点辩证法的气味。使得列宁不能不愤怒的，是他的这样一套谬论：“所有形形色色的社会生活都是意识——心理的生活……社会性和意识性是不可分离的。社会在和社会意识，按这两个词的确切的含义来说，是同一的。”（同上，340页）试问，面对着这样的胡说，一个真正的马克思主义者能够轻易加以容忍，而不起来给以严厉的斥责吗？列宁之所以要加以斥责，是因为波格达诺夫把社会存在和社会意识简单地等同起来。列宁在这里决不是要否认意识和存在之间的辩证的同一性。
    列宁所引用的拉法格的话是不是帮助了我们的世诚同志呢？也不。如果仔细看一看那一句引话的前后文，就不难发现那是另外一回事情。首先应该注意，拉法格否认“拉波波特硬说马克思认为‘存在着观念与实在的同一性’”的时候，他所提出的理由是“我们从来也不使用这样的形而上学用语。”这就是说，因为拉波波特是一个新康德主义者，他本人是把观念和实在形而上学地对立起来，把观念看做虚构，看做没有任何实在性的东西；在他看来，一说到观念和实在的同一性，就等于把观念和实在完全等同起来，并意味着“观念就等于一切实在”，“除观念以外，不再有其他的实在”了。这样的意义上来了解同一性，和马克思主义者的看法自然是根本不同的。马克思主义者认为，除了人的主观观念之外，还存在着物质的客体，不能说只有观念才是实在的。物质客体也是实在的，而且是更根本的实在。应该注意，拉法格在说了上面的话以后，紧接着有这样一段下文：“观念像客体一样，也是实在的，它是客体在头脑中的反映”。（同上，209页）这里说得很清楚，“实在的”的东西不仅仅包括观念，还有观念之外的客体，因此，拉法格的话实际上是包含着两方面的意思：第一，观念和客体，是有差别的两个东西，不能形而上学地把它们等同起来。第二，观念和客体之间有辩证的同一性，差别的同一性，因为它们都是“实在的”，不能形而上学地把它们对立起来。
    如果世诚同志认为拉法格的话还不够清楚，那就可以再看一看也是列宁所引用的一个唯物主义者的另一段话：“……对唯物主义者说来，把a priori（先天的）认识和‘自在之物’区别开来完全是多余的，因为唯物主义者在任何地方都没有把自然界中的经常联系割断，都没有把物质和精神看作彼此根本不同的东西，而是认为它们不过是同一东西的两个方面。……”（同上，208页）说这段话的唯物主义者，是费尔巴哈的信徒，还不是辩证唯物主义者，但他的这段话是列宁所赞同的。形而上学唯物主义者自然不能在认识论上应用辩证法，但他们的著作中也不是不可能有个别的（也是极不完全的）辩证法因素的。例如这段话就肯定了思维和存在的差别的同一性，肯定它们是“同一”东西的两个方面。
    世诚同志在去年10月11日光明日报上所发表的一篇文章里，坚决否认思维与存在之间的矛盾的同一性，否认两者之间的不可分割的联系，否认“思维和存在这两个方面，在一定条件下，互为条件，共处于一个统一体中”，硬说这样的看法是“原则同格论”的“唯心主义理论”。世诚同志自认为是一个拥护辩证唯物主义的人，而其实这种说法比费尔巴哈主义者——形而上学唯物主义还落后得多！因为列宁所引用的这个费尔巴哈信徒就明确肯定思维与存在的不可分的“经常联系”，肯定“这两个方面”是“共处于一个统一体中”，当然，费尔巴哈在他的《未来哲学原理》里曾批判过唯心主义者的“思维与存在的同一性”的提法，但他之所以批判它，是因为它把存在看作“一种与思维没有分别的存在，一种只作为理性的属性的存在”（中文本，42页），是因为它把同一看做“思维与自身的同一”。费尔巴哈在同一本书里又肯定了“思维与存在的统一”（见该书中文本74页），并给与了唯物主义的解释。费尔巴哈的唯物主义在认识论上是消极的反映论，它和马克思列宁主义的能动的反映论有根本的区别，它的重大缺点已经有一些同志作了详细的批判，他们的批判很对，我不再重复他们的意见。我在这里只想指出一点：由于费尔巴哈不懂辩证法，因此他自己并不知道，当他讲到“思维与存在的统一”的时候，他在事实上已经承认了两者之间的差别的同一性。而这就足以说明，即使就是形而上学唯物主义，也是在一般的反映论的基础上肯定思维与存在的不可分的联系，肯定它们之间的差别的同一性的，否则它就不成其为唯物主义，就要变成二元论或不可知论了。
    说到这里，我们就很容易了解关于俄文совладать的问 题了：列宁为什么要坚持在“符合”“协调”的意义上来使用它，而反对在“同一”的意义上来使用它呢？要知道列宁的分析是有的放矢地针对着经验批判论者巴札罗夫的诡辩的，巴札罗夫利用这个俄文字的双关意义——“一致”和“同一”两重意义，把“关于物及其特性的表象和存在于我们之外的现实是一致的”这句话，曲解成“感性表象也就是（着重点是巴札罗夫加的）存在于我们之外的现实”（《列宁全集》，中文版，十四卷，110页）列宁在这里所反对的，是巴札罗夫把“一致”曲解为形而上学的“同一”，而并没有否认“关于物及其特性的表象和存在于我们之外的现实”之间的辩证的同一性——辩证的“同一”和“一致”是没有区别的——，这是非常清楚的。
    （三）
    否认思维与存在之间存在任何同一性的同志们，认为他们的观点还可以在恩格斯那里找到根据。他们的理由是，恩格斯在《费尔巴哈及德国古典哲学的终结》一书里讲到“思维与存在的同一性问题”时，他的话是从黑格尔借用来的，是把它仅仅当作唯心主义的提法来处理的，也就是说，他是以否定的态度来对待思维与存在的同一性问题的。这些同志们还说：列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》里引用恩格斯有关的这一段话时，特别把“用哲学的语言说来，这个问题就叫做思维与存在的同一性问题”一句删掉，好像这就足以证明，列宁也认为恩格斯是否定了思维与存在的同一性的。
    这些说法都是非常牵强的。
    说“思维与存在的同一性问题”是从黑格尔的著作里借用过来的，这能不能成为充分的理由，来证明“思维与存在的同一性”仅仅只能有唯心主义的意义呢？马克思主义者从黑格尔的著作里借来的语言不只这一个，例如“否定之否定”，就是黑格尔的术语，这个术语有它的缺点，但马克思列宁主义者借用了，谁也不能说它仅仅是唯心主义的术语。黑格尔的哲学有两方面，一方面是唯心主义的，另一方面还有辩证法——被唯心主义体系闷坏了的，极不彻底的，但比起黑格尔以前的哲学来说是最自觉的辩证法。马克思列宁主义者对于黑格尔的唯心主义，是采取彻底否定的态度，而对于它的辩证方面则继承了它的合理的核心，并加以改造和发展。就思维与存在的同一性问题来说，也有这样的情形。黑格尔哲学中的思维与存在的同一性的思想也有两个方面，就哲学根本问题的第一个方面来说，黑格尔把思维看做第一位的东西，把思维与存在的同一性解释成“存在即思维”意义，把存在解释成“与思维没有分别的存在”，因此它就被赋予了唯心主义的意义。就哲学根本问题的第二方面来说，黑格尔和其他绝大多数哲学家（包括所有的唯物主义者和彻底的唯心主义者）肯定地解答了“思维是否能够认识现实世界”的问题，并在批判康德的不可知论的时候，对思维与存在的关系在一定程度上给与了辩证法的说明，在这一方面黑格尔的“思维与存在的同一性”的思想就有其合理的、即辩证法的成分，而不仅仅是一个唯心主义的命题。
    应该注意，恩格斯的著作里不是就哲学根本问题的第一方面来谈思维与存在的同一性问题，而是在哲学根本问题的第二个方面提出这问题的。哲学根本问题的第二个方面，不是要解决划分唯物主义或唯心主义的问题，而是要解决现实世界对于人的思维是否有可知性的问题。在问题的这个方面，肯定现实世界的可知性，也就是肯定思维和存在的同一性。虽然唯物主义者的肯定和唯心主义者的肯定有根本方向的不同，但就反对不可知论这一点来说，都是肯定了世界的可知性，肯定了思维与存在的同一性，则是很清楚的。恩格斯在提出这个问题的时候，他所要批判的直接对象并不是唯心主义，而是不可知论。引用“思维与存在的同一性”时，也是为着批判不承认思维和存在之间有任何同一性的康德主义思想。因此，就斗争的任务来说，恩格斯必须对思维和存在的同一性问题给与肯定的解决，是一目了然的。而且即使单就语法的顺序看，《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》里提出“我们的思维能否认识现实世界？我们能否在我们的关于现实世界的表象和概念中构成对现实的正确反映？”的问题后，紧接着就指出，“用哲学的语言说来，这个问题就叫做思维与存在之同一性的问题”；并且随即答复说：“绝大多数的哲学家都肯定地解决了这个问题”。这样的文字顺序也说明，恩格斯是明明认为唯物主义者（包括在“绝大多数”哲学家之内）对“思维与存在的同一性”问题也给与了肯定的答复，而对这一点要作出相反的解释，则是很牵强的。
    列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》里引用恩格斯的这段话时，也指出哲学根本问题的第二方面，不是直接解决唯心主义和唯物主义的划分问题的。列宁说：“恩格斯根据这个基本问题把哲学家划分为‘两大阵营’，接着他又指出，哲学的基本问题‘还有另一个方面’，……”（列宁全集，14卷94页）这里很明白地说到哲学基本问题的第二方面所要解决的，是“两大阵营”划分之后的另外的问题，而在这个方面，对“思维与存在的同一性问题”的肯定或否定的解决，是不会直接涉及到唯心主义或唯物主义的分界问题的。
    世诚同志说，“列宁在这一段引文里删掉了“用哲学的语言来说，这个问题就叫做思维和存在的同一性问题”一句话，就足以证明列宁也认为恩格斯否定了思维与存在的同一性。其实，事情的逻辑和世诚同志的主观估计恰恰相反。如果列宁认定恩格斯否定了“思维与存在的同一性”的问题，那他就不但不会删掉这一句话，而且一定要把它引用出来。因为列宁正在和一大批主观唯心主义者进行战斗，这些反动思想都用“思维与存在的同一性”的形而上学的解释作为自己的武器，列宁正在用全力对付他们的这个武器。如果恩格斯的著作早已否定了思维与存在的同一性，那么，列宁正需要把他的话引用出来，作为帮助解除唯心主义武装的强有力的根据。
    列宁删掉了这句话，正足以说明恩格斯谈到“思维与存在的同一性”时，不是为着批判唯心主义，而是为着解决另外的问题，对于列宁的斗争任务来说，没有引用的必要。
    人们也许要问：恩格斯和列宁都是马克思主义者，他们的观点当然是一致的，他们怎能够在同一个问题上有不同的态度呢？提出这样的问题的人，是由于不注意历史发展过程。马克思主义是历史的科学，必须依据历史情况来研究问题。恩格斯和列宁所处的历史时期不同，他们的具体斗争任务也有所不同。他们虽然在形式上好像是接触到同一个问题，实际上所要解决的却是不同的问题。在恩格斯生前的时期，资产阶级反动哲学思潮的主要口号是“回到康德去”，是要把黑格尔当做“死狗”看待。它的目的是要散布康德主义的不可知论，散布思维与存在之间绝对没有同一性的谬论，散布人的思想、概念不能认识客观现实，而仅仅是主观的虚构之类的谬论，来贬低理性，贬低科学，反对科学。这时工人运动中出现的修正主义者，如伯恩斯坦，施米特之流，也就跟在资产阶级教授们的尾巴后面，妄想用康德的不可知论来“修正”马克思主义，来贬低马克思主义的科学性。面对着这样的资产阶级反动思潮，包括修正主义思潮，恩格斯必须着重解决认识的辩证法问题，解决现实世界的可知与不可知的问题。由于当时的康德主义者，（包括修正主义者）对黑格尔的疯狂的攻击，主要是针对着他们的辩证法，而不是针对他的唯心主义，因此不论马克思和恩格斯，都曾经在自己的著作里，屡次强调过黑格尔辩证法的合理因素，虽然他们也同时指出，黑格尔的辩证法和他们的辩证法有根本的不同。恩格斯在《费尔巴哈及德国古典哲学的终结》里论到“思维与存在的同一性”问题时，就是为着要批判康德主义的、否认思维与存在之间有着任何同一性的、不可知论的谬论。为着粉碎这样的论敌，很自然地，他必须肯定“思维与存在的同一性”，肯定黑格尔在解答这个问题方面的合理的辩证法的因素，但同时也批判了黑格尔在这个问题上的唯心主义的论证。
    列宁是处在另一个时期——资本主义的帝国主义时期，这时资产阶级反动哲学思潮的主流发展成为更加腐朽百倍的主观唯心主义，而修正主义者也就胁肩谄笑地跟在资产阶级教授的尾巴后面，用各种色调的主观唯心主义来“修正”马克思主义哲学。他们散布意识和存在绝对同一的胡说，通过“意识即存在”、“存在即意识”的诡辩，来否认外界世界的客观存在，否认科学规律的客观性，否认马克思主义学说的科学的现实性。面对这个到处泛滥的反动哲学思潮，列宁必须着重解决唯物主义和唯心主义严格分界的问题，解决唯物主义哲学的党派性问题，必须对于唯心主义的主要武器——思维与存在的同一性的形而上学的胡说坚决加以粉碎，不给它留下丝毫存在的余地。但是，如果把列宁对于意识和存在的形而上学同一性谬论的这种坚决斗争精神，解释成列宁否认意识和存在之间的任何同一性，解释成列宁把意识和存在看做绝对对立的东西，那就大错特错了。
    恩格斯对“思维与存在的同一性”的肯定态度，还可以从他致施米特的信中得到显著的证明。这也就是世诚同志提到的1895年的那一封信，但世诚同志把那信的意思完全读成它的反面了，他以为恩格斯的信帮了他的忙，其实恰恰相反。恩格斯在那封信里所批评的，是施米特把“价值规律贬低为一种必需的虚构”的错误观点。这正是康德主义的、否定思维与存在的同一性、否认人们关于价值规律的思想反映着客观世界的经济规律的谬论。如果设想恩格斯在对康德主义者否认思维与存在的同一性的错误观点进行批判的时候，自己却又和康德主义者站在一道来反对黑格尔，并明确地指出了，思维和存在不是同一的’”（去年10月11日《光明日报》所载世诚同志文章中的话）那不是太奇怪了吗？
    让我们把世诚同志所谓“明确地指出了‘思维和存在不是同一的’”那一段恩格斯的文字再仔细读一读吧！它的意思究竟是不是像他所设想的一样？恩格斯说：“你对价值规律的责难，适用于从实在的观点来看的一切概念。用黑格尔的话来说，思维和存在的同一性完全切合于你所举出的圆形和多角形的例子。换句话说，事物的概念和事物的现实是同时运动的，就像两根渐近线一样，不断地互相接近，但永远不会相遇。二者间的这种差异，就正是使得概念不直接成为现实而现实也不直接成为其本身的概念的那种差异。概念具有概念的本性，因而和现实并不直接吻合，尽管它最初必须从现实中抽象得出；由于这个原因，概念毕竟不是虚构，除非你把思维的一切结果都说成虚构，因为现实之符合思维的结果，只是以非常间接迂回的方式甚至只是渐近线式的接近。”
    这里按照世诚同志所引用的一字不少地再抄出来。世诚同志断定这段引文是否认思维和存在的同一性的，但他一点理由也没说出来。现在让我们来解释一下，为什么恩格斯的这段话的内容和世诚同志的看法是完全相反的。先从多角形和圆形的关系的例子开始说起，几何学的规律告诉我们，等边多角形的边无限增大的结果就会接近圆形；这个规律说明多角形可以转化为圆形，两者之间有着辩证的同一性。康德主义者施米特否认这个同一性，并企图以此作为比喻，来否认思维和存在的同一性，他的理由是：多角形尽管能接近圆形，终究不是圆形，思维、概念尽管能接近存在、现实，但终究不是存在、现实，而只是虚构。恩格斯的这段话正是针锋相对地驳斥了施米特把思维和存在，概念和现实形而上学地绝对对立起来的不可知论观点，他指出思维和存在的同一性原则不是不适用于施米特的圆形和多角形的例子（如施米特所想的那样），而是“完全切合”于这个例子，圆形和多角形的辩证的同一性，也正好用作比喻来说明思维与存在，概念与现实之间的关系。概念和现实的同一性首先在于两者是同时运动的，像渐近线一样不断地互相接近的，并且概念“最初必须从现实中抽象得出”。但这个同一性并不是形而上学的绝对等同，两者任何时候都是有差异的；概念决不会“直接”成为现实，思维和存在决不会“直接”吻合。应该指出：说概念、思维不能“直接”成为现实存在，这并没有否定了，而正是肯定了它们能间接地，在一定条件下经过某种媒介转化为现实、转化为存在。马克思说的“理论一旦掌握群众，就会变成物质的力量”。我国的社会主义建设，由于贯彻总路线和政治挂帅的原则，在现实生活中推动起“大跃进”式的高速度发展，这些例子活生生地说明概念、思维通过某些环节间接地转化为现实存在，说明“概念毕竟不是虚构”，思维和存在毕竟是有同一性的，因而也就粉碎了把概念看做虚构、否认思维与存在的同一性的、康德主义的形而上学观点。（附带说一下：恩格斯这段话的原文的重心，是放在肯定“概念毕竟不是虚构”这句话上，译文没有把他的意思充分确切地传达出来）自然，思维与存在的同一性是辩证的同一性，两者的接近、符合是间接迂回的，甚至只是渐进线式的，形而上学唯物主义者不懂这个辩证法的过程，他们认为思维应该一次就完全正确地反映现实存在，这也是不正确的。
    （四）
    总之，世诚同志等人否认思维与存在的同一性的看法是错误的，因为他们忘记了同一性有形而上学和辩证法两种不同的理解，而辩证法的同一性是普遍地存在于一切事物之中，也存在于思维与存在的关系中。
    当唯心主义者，特别是主观唯心主义者用形而上学的观点来解释同一性，把“意识和存在的同一性”曲解成“存在等同于意识”，把存在曲解成“与思维没有分别的存在”的时候，马克思列宁主义者为着批判唯心主义，驳斥他们的这种形而上学的曲解，就要与他们针锋相对地坚决否认意识和存在的这种同一性，但在批判不可知论的时候，就要肯定思维与存在的同一性，因为不可知论者企图否认它们之间的辩证的同一性。
    否认思维与存在之间有任何同一性，否认两者之间的“不可分割的联系”，否认它们“在一定条件下，互为条件，共处于统一体中”，像世诚同志那样，就会接近康德主义的不可知论观点，或者即使没有完全成为不可知论，但由于不承认思维与存在的辩证的联系和相互转化关系，由于在认识论上不能够应用辩证法，仍然会陷于形而上学唯物主义的片面性。
    过去，普列哈诺夫就是由于不了解认识的辩证法，不懂得思维与存在的辩证的同一性，因而在和康德主义者——修正主义者进行斗争的时候，在一些根本问题上陷于自相矛盾和混乱的境地。普列哈诺夫在反对修正主义的斗争中是起过一定的积极作用的，但当伯恩斯坦、施米特之流施用诡辩的手法，把唯物主义者所理解的思维与存在的同一性和唯心主义者的理解混淆起来，硬说“纯粹唯物主义终究要归宿于唯心主义”的时候，普列哈诺夫在这个反动思想的进攻前面，不但不敢从正面加以驳斥，并像恩格斯那样明确承认唯物主义在不同于唯心主义的基础上肯定了思维与存在的同一性，相反地，却矢口否认思维与存在的同一性，甚至于说“只有唯心主义才承认思维与存在的同一性”。彻底的马克思列宁主义者——辩证唯物主义者是不会作出这样片面的论断来的。列宁的《唯物主义与经验批判主义》从头到尾毫不留情地批判了唯心主义的“意识与存在的同一性”的谬论，但在他的这部著作里始终也找不到“只有唯心主义者才承认思维与存在的同一性”这样片面绝对的论	断。但是，尽管普列哈诺夫的文章里出现了这样片面绝对的论断，在他的另一篇文章中，他却不能不在逻辑上打了自己的耳光，肯定在“观念的东西”有可能正确符合于“物质的东西”这个意义上，“我们可以而且应当说观念的东西与物质的东西的同一性。”（《反对哲学中的修正主义》，156页）虽然他所说的这个意义，还是片面的，还不是指观念的东西和物质的东西的相互联系和相互转化这一个辩证法的意义。
    列宁在《哲学笔记》里曾指出普列哈诺夫不懂认识论的辩证法，因而他的唯物主义常常表现为形而上学的、庸俗的唯物主义。列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》里又批判了普列哈诺夫的“象形文字论”观点，揭露了它的不可知论的错误性质。普列哈诺夫的这些错误，都不是偶然的，它说明如果不能在认识论上应用辩证法，不理解思维与存在的辩证的同一性，就有可能使人们走上反马克思列宁主义的道路。
    思维与存在的同一性问题，在历史上曾经是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义——资产阶级唯心主义斗争中所涉及的一个重要问题。在这个斗争中恩格斯和列宁保卫了唯物主义的认识论，保卫了辩证法。今天，我们研究恩格斯和列宁关于思维与存在的同一性的思想，不仅有巨大的理论意义，也具有极其重要的现实意义。现代修正主义者也正是在思想方法的领域内到处破坏着唯物主义认识论和辩证法。正确地解决思维与存在的同一性问题，有利于我们反对修正主义的斗争。同时，为了正确理解我国社会主义建设的规律，也必须很好研究这个问题。两年来在中国出现的轰轰烈烈的大跃进形势和人民公社化运动，说明中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志的指导思想——以社会主义建设的总路线为中心的指导思想，是如何正确地反映了亿万人民的社会主义实践的客观规律，而这个正确的指导思想又如何通过广大人民的群众运动转化为排山倒海的物质力量，这正是充分体现了思维与存在互为条件互相转化的规律，充分体现了它们之间的辩证同一性规律的空前辉煌的典型。不了解思维与存在的辩证的同一性，也就不能正确地理解党的总路线，大跃进和人民公社的伟大意义，就可能在认识上行动上犯错误。右倾机会主义的、修正主义的世界观主要是主观唯心主义的，他们在实际上正是形而上学地看待思维与存在的同一性，把存在看做和自己的主观意识没有分别的存在；但否认思维与存在的辩证同一性的人，看不见两者的相互联系和相互转化，看不见人们的主观能动性，看不见反映客观规律的指导思想可以通过群众运动的环节转化为惊天动地的强大物质力量，也同样会犯右倾机会主义的错误。
