    Rereading "Poverty"
    Kong Fanbin, Secretary of the Hongguang People's Commune Committee, Runan, Henan

    It has been twenty-five years since Comrade Fang Zhimin wrote the article "Poverty" in May 1935.

    Although I had read this article in the past, this time, rereading it moved me even more, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Comrade Fang Zhimin's brilliant image of hard work, simplicity, and complete selflessness appeared before my eyes. His noble character of "always working for the people and never for himself" is something I will never forget.

    Comrade Zhimin had been engaged in revolutionary struggle for more than ten years. At that time, he was the commander-in-chief of the Northern Expedition Anti-Japanese Vanguard and always lived a simple life, never extravagant. The funds he handled totaled several million yuan; however, the money raised for the revolution was used for the revolutionary cause bit by bit. On the day he was captured, Kuomintang soldiers wanted to find a thousand or eight hundred silver dollars, or some gold bracelets or rings, on this commander-in-chief to make a windfall. Who knew that after searching from top to bottom, from the collar of his jacket to the bottom of his socks, they found nothing but a watch and a fountain pen, not even a single copper coin. This is the image of a great and frugal proletarian revolutionary. Can readers not be moved by this?

    Hard work, simplicity, integrity, and public service are the true colors of our proletarian revolutionaries, which can be seen very clearly in our revolutionary martyrs.

    The Party constantly teaches us to always maintain and carry forward our Party's fine traditions. Many of our comrades are selfless, strictly separate public and private matters, and always prioritize state property. Ren Jie, the accountant of the Chishiqiao Brigade in Qinshui County, Shanxi Province, hasn't misspent a single penny in ten years, buying only one bottle of ink and two dip pens a year. Wang Shengzu, the accountant and Communist Party member of Zhouyi Production Team, Louguan Commune, Zhouzhi, Shaanxi, is known by the commune members as the "reassuring accountant." He has kept accounts every day for seven years, using a total of eleven pen nibs, each of which he sharpened when it became dull, and continued to use until it was completely unusable. In seven years, he has never bought a new envelope, always using old newspapers to make envelopes, or reusing old envelopes he received. Comrades like Ren Jie and Wang Shengzu, who are hardworking, thrifty, honest, and dedicated, are truly countless in our lives.

    Spending less money, accomplishing more, being selfless, honest, and serving the public are excellent qualities we must possess, and they also concern the country's affairs. Isn't our general line for building socialism to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results? This word "economical" is an indispensable component of the general line. If we fail to achieve this "economical" result, then "greater, faster, better" will be directly and greatly affected.

    However, this is also related to each individual's moral character and style. Is one thrifty and careful in everything, or is one extravagant? Chairman Mao, in his article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," called on us to learn from Bethune's "spirit of utter selflessness," and also said: "From this point of departure, one can become a person of great benefit to the people." The aforementioned Ren Jie and Wang Shengzu are precisely such people. From these people, can we not also see the shadows of the great revolutionary fighters in the article "Poverty"?

    Comrade Fang Zhimin said in "Poverty": "A life of poverty, purity, and simplicity is precisely where we revolutionaries can overcome many difficulties!" The profound meaning of this sentence is something we must repeatedly chew on.

    Read "Poverty" several more times, it will be of great benefit to us in maintaining and carrying forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity of proletarian revolutionaries.

    重读《清贫》
    中共河南汝南红光公社委员会书记  孔繁斌
    方志敏同志1935年5月写的《清贫》这篇文章，到今天已有二十五年了。
    过去虽也读过这篇文章，而这次重读了更为感动，很久不能入睡。方志敏同志那种艰苦朴素没有一毫私利的光辉形象呈现在眼前。那种“处处为人民、从不为自己”的高贵品德使我永远不能忘怀。
    志敏同志从事革命斗争十余年了，当时担任北上抗日先遣军总司令，一向过着朴素的生活，从没奢侈过。他经手的款项，总在数百万元；但为革命而筹集的金钱，是一点一滴地用之于革命事业。在他被俘的那天，国民党兵士想从这个总司令身上搜出一千或八百大洋，或者搜出一些金镯金戒子一类的东西，发个意外之财。哪知道从上身摸到下身，从袄领捏到袜底，除了一只时表和一支自来水笔之外，一个铜板都没搜出。这就是伟大俭朴的无产阶级的革命家的形象，读者看到这里能不受感动吗？
    艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公是我们无产阶级革命家的本色，这在我们革命先烈身上看得很清楚的。
    党经常教导我们，要永远保持和发扬我党这种优良的传统作风。我们有许多同志克己奉公，公私分明，处处以国家财产为重。山西省沁源县赤石桥大队会计任杰同志，十年没错花过一文钱，一年只买了一瓶墨水、两支蘸水笔。陕西盩厔楼观公社盩一生产队会计、共产党员王绳祖，被社员称为“放心会计”。他七年来天天记账，一共用了十一个钢笔尖，每个笔尖都是秃了磨，磨了再用，一直到磨了不能用的时候才作废。七年来，他没有买过一个新信封，总是用旧报纸糊制信封，或把收到的旧信封翻制再用。像任杰和王绳祖这样克勤克俭、廉洁奉公的同志，在我们生活中真是成千成万，数不胜数。
    少花钱，多办事，大公无私，廉洁奉公，这是我们必须具备的优良品德，同时也是关乎国家的事。我们建设社会主义的总路线不就是多快好省吗？这“省”字是总路线的一个不可缺少的组成部分，如果做不到这个“省”字，那末“多快好”都会受到直接而又巨大的影响。
    然而，这又和每个人的道德品质有关，和每个人的作风有关，是处处节俭、处处打算呢；还是大手大脚呢？毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中，早就号召我们学习白求恩“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，并且还说：“从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”上面所说的任杰和王绳祖就正是这样的人。从这些人的身上，我们不是也可看到《清贫》一文中的伟大革命战士的影子吗？
    方志敏同志在《清贫》里说：“清贫，洁白朴素的生活，正是我们革命者能够战胜许多困难的地方！”这句话的深刻含义是我们要反复咀嚼的。
    多读几遍《清贫》吧，这对我们保持和发扬无产阶级革命家艰苦朴素的优良作风，会大有好处的。
