Adapting Planting Methods to Local Conditions for Increased Production
Beicai Commune Rationally Utilizes Scattered Plots and Implements Intercropping and Relay Planting

(Our Dispatch) The Beicai Commune in Chuansha County, Shanghai, has made great strides in fully utilizing land, resulting in significant agricultural production increases. Last year, the commune increased grain production by 348,900 jin through extensive planting in scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields. This year, grain has been intercropped and relay planted in cotton and vegetable fields. All 713 mu of scattered plots in the commune have also been planted with grain or vegetables. This summer harvest, the commune has already collected 228,000 jin of grain from scattered plots, along with a large quantity of vegetables, increasing the supply to the city.

The experience of the Beicai Commune proves that planting in scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields must be adapted to local conditions and specific crops; otherwise, if the varieties planted are unsuitable, the results will be minimal. Based on years of planting experience, the commune concluded that: castor beans and sunflowers, which have many branches and leaves, should be planted near embankments to facilitate ventilation and light penetration; taro and soybeans, which are water-resistant, should be planted near waterlogged areas; pumpkins and other climbing crops should be planted on uneven slopes; *Vigna umbellata* (rice bean), which is particularly vigorous, should be planted in newly reclaimed wasteland; corn and other tall-stalk crops and short-maturing *Amaranthus viridis* (slender amaranth) and *Amaranthus tricolor* (Chinese spinach) should be intercropped in melon and vegetable fields; foxtail millet, which has thin stalks, narrow leaves, and matures early, should be intercropped in cotton fields, and so on. The experience of the Beicai Commune also proves that, under the same conditions of scattered plots, planting different crops results in vastly different yields. Last year, the Yuqiao Production Team planted 80 mu of *Vigna umbellata* on wasteland, achieving a yield of 200 to 250 jin per mu. However, the same wasteland planted with soybeans and red beans only yielded dozens of jin per mu, or even nothing at all. Intercropping different crops in cotton fields also resulted in significant differences. Last year, the Fifth Team of the Yuqiao Production Team intercropped five mu of cotton with soybeans, yielding 90 jin of soybeans per mu. However, the soybeans' lush branches and leaves affected the cotton's ventilation and light penetration, resulting in a yield of only 194 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which was 30 to 40 percent lower than the yield of regular cotton fields. Three mu of cotton were intercropped with foxtail millet, yielding 128 jin of foxtail millet per mu. Because the intercropped foxtail millet had better ventilation and light penetration than pure foxtail millet, the spikes grew as large as dog tails. Four mu of intercropped foxtail millet were equivalent to one mu of pure foxtail millet. Because foxtail millet has narrow leaves, thin stalks, and matures early, the foxtail millet was harvested when the cotton was flowering and bolting, and the cotton's growth was not affected by the foxtail millet, resulting in a yield of 264 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which was similar to the yield of regular cotton fields, achieving a double harvest of cotton and grain. This year, the commune has promoted the experience of the Fifth Team of the Yuqiao Production Team in intercropping cotton with foxtail millet.

Ensuring a bumper harvest of crops in scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields, strengthening management is another very important key. Last year, during the busy season, some areas of the Beicai Commune focused on the production of major field crops and neglected the management of crops in scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields, resulting in some crops being planted but not harvested or yielding little. For example, the Sixth Team of the Zhongjie Production Team planted over 1,000 castor beans and sunflowers and more than one mu of sorghum in scattered plots, but failed to weed and fertilize them in time after sowing. The sorghum produced small spikes with fine grains, yielding less than 150 jin per mu. The castor beans and sunflowers had even poorer yields. The Third Team of the same production team, while doing a good job in the production of major field crops, organized professional personnel to manage various crops in scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields. The five and a half mu of sorghum planted in scattered plots grew thick stalks, large spikes, and plump grains, with most spikes being five to seven inches long, yielding over 300 jin per mu. Therefore, this year, the Beicai Commune Party Committee promptly proposed measures to strengthen management: the crops intercropped/relay planted in the fields should be managed concurrently by the commune members managing the major crops; crops in scattered plots should be managed by professional management teams established by elderly and experienced commune members.

The experience of the Beicai Commune in planting scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields also confirms the need to solve the fertilizer problem. The commune has explored fertilizer sources from the following aspects: (1) Turning green manure and vegetable scraps into the soil during plowing, equivalent to applying 8 to 10 dan of fertilizer per mu. (2) Widely collecting vegetable leaves and various crop vines, stalks, and leaves to make compost. Each mu of pumpkin vines alone can accumulate more than 20 dan of fertilizer. (3) Adopting methods such as topdressing based on seedling condition, applying fertilizer sparingly and frequently, and avoiding fertilization before rain and reducing fertilization after rain can increase fertilizer utilization by 20% to 30%. (4) Incorporating the fertilizer plan for scattered plots and intercropping/relay planting in the fields into the fertilizer accumulation plan for major field crops, and carrying out a long-term fertilizer accumulation campaign combining regular and concentrated efforts.

### 因地制宜巧种田多增产  北蔡公社合理利用零星地实行间作套种

    因地制宜巧种田多增产
    北蔡公社合理利用零星地实行间作套种
    本报讯　上海市川沙县北蔡公社在充分利用土地上面大做文章，农业增产的效果十分显著。去年这个公社在广种零星隙地和大田间作套种方面，增产了三十四万八千九百斤粮食。今年又在棉田、瓜菜田内，间作、套种了粮食；全社七百十三亩零星隙地也全部种上粮食或蔬菜。今年夏收，这个公社已从零星隙地上收到粮食二十二万八千斤，还收到大量蔬菜，增加了城市的供应。
    北蔡公社的经验证明了种植零星隙地和大田间作、套种，必须因地制宜、因作物制宜，否则种植的品种不适宜，收效不大。公社根据历年种植经验，得出结论：堤岸旁宜种蓖麻、向日葵等枝叶多的作物，易于通风透光；容易受水浸的水滩边宜种芋艿、黄豆等耐水作物；高低不平的坡地宜种南瓜等爬藤作物；新垦荒地宜种生长力特别旺盛的米赤豆；瓜菜田里适宜间作玉米等高秆作物和成熟期短的鸡毛菜、米苋等；棉花田里适宜间作秆细、叶狭、成熟较早的粟子等等。北蔡公社的经验还证明：同样条件的零星隙地，种植不同的作物，收获量高低悬殊。去年御乔生产队在荒地上种植的米赤豆八十亩，亩产量达到二百斤至二百五十斤，但同样的荒地种植的黄豆、赤豆，每亩只能收到几十斤，甚至有种无收。棉花田内间作不同的作物，结果也有显著不同。御乔生产队第五小队去年有五亩棉花和黄豆间作，每亩收到黄豆九十斤，但黄豆枝、叶繁茂，影响棉花通风透光，亩产籽棉只有一百九十四斤，低于一般棉田产量三至四成。有三亩棉花和粟子间作，每亩收到粟子一百二十八斤。因为间作的粟子比净作的粟子通风透光好，长的穗头都像狗尾巴一样大，四亩间作粟子相当于一亩净作。粟子叶狭、秆细，成熟早，棉花开花结铃，粟子已收割，因棉花生长不受粟子影响，亩产籽棉二百六十四斤，和一般棉田的产量相仿，达到了棉粮双丰收。今年全社已推广御乔生产队五小队棉花和粟子间作的经验。
    确保零星隙地和大田间作、套种的作物得到丰收，加强管理又是一个很重要的关键。去年在生产大忙时期，北蔡公社有些地区抓了大田正项作物的生产，丢了零星隙地和大田间作、套种作物的管理，有些作物就产生了有种无收或收获不多的现象。如中界生产队第六小队在零星隙地上种植的一千多棵蓖麻、向日葵和一亩多高粱，播种后没有及时锄草、施肥，高粱结的穗头不大，粒子又细小，亩产不到一百五十斤。蓖麻、向日葵结实更差。同一生产队第三小队，在搞好大田正项作物生产的同时，组织专业人员管理零星隙地上的各种作物和间作、套种的作物，零星隙地上种植的五亩五分高粱，长得秆粗、穗大、粒壮，大部分穗头都有五至七寸长，亩产量超过三百斤。因此，今年北蔡公社党委及时提出了加强管理的措施：大田间作、套种的作物确定由管理正项作物的社员同时管好；零星隙地上的作物组织年老、经验丰富的社员建立专业管理小组管理。
    北蔡公社种植零星隙地和大田间作、套种的经验也证实了必须解决肥料问题。这个公社从以下几方面挖掘肥源：（1）在翻地时把青草和菜皮翻入土内，每亩等于增施肥料八至十担。（2）广泛收集菜叶和各种作物的藤、秆、叶做堆肥。仅南瓜藤每亩就可以堆积肥料二十多担。（3）采取看苗追肥、少施勤施和雨前不施、雨后少施等观察气候巧施肥料的方法，可提高肥料利用率20％到30％。（4）把零星隙地和大田间作、套种的用肥计划纳入大田正项作物的积肥计划，开展经常与突击相结合的长期积肥运动。
