    "Well of Happiness"
    By Our Correspondent Guo Shuochuan
    The inexhaustible water of the reservoir in the overseas Chinese hometown—Fuqing County—flows day and night along a spiderweb-like network of canals, nourishing the vast fields of Fuqing. This clear spring transforms arid land into fertile soil, low-yielding areas into high-yielding areas, and beaches into arable land; it creates a prosperous and beautiful scene on land that once suffered from drought nine years out of ten, now displaying endless rice paddies, rolling wheat waves, lush trees, and crisscrossing power lines. People call this water from the Dongzhang Reservoir the "Well of Happiness."

    The "Well of Happiness" was born during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. This was a large reservoir, with a total storage capacity of over 180 million cubic meters, which the Party and government began constructing at the end of 1957 to fundamentally change Fuqing County's perennial vulnerability to drought and flood disasters. This water conservancy project, combined with the more than 30,000 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects already built, formed an agricultural irrigation network throughout Fuqing County.

    Last summer, precisely when the early rice was starting to sprout, the peanuts were in bloom, and the soybeans were generally forming pods, it did not rain for more than thirty consecutive days. At this crucial moment for the summer harvest, the water from the Dongzhang Reservoir arrived, moistening the crops. When it was almost time for harvest, it rained for more than forty consecutive days, with the rainfall accounting for half of the county's normal annual rainfall. The reservoir dam held back the mountain torrents that erupted from the mountains upstream of the Longjiang River. Such drought and flood, if it had happened before liberation, would have been a terrible disaster! According to historical records, a rainstorm in 1946 flooded 190,000 mu of sweet potatoes and rice in the county, and the losses of houses, livestock, and boats were incalculable. In a drought in 1948, 98 people starved to death in Pinghua Township alone, and 141 became beggars. But last year, Fuqing County's 140,000 mu of early rice generally yielded a bumper harvest, and even the vast coastal areas, which had always had infertile soil and low yields, became high-yielding areas that overcame drought and flooding, with an average yield of 420 jin per mu.

    After the bumper summer harvest last year, the autumn also brought a bumper harvest. More than 95,000 mu of late rice yielded an average of 530 jin per mu, more than 100 jin more than the average yield of early rice. It was also the first time in Fuqing County's history that the yield per unit area of late rice exceeded that of early rice.

    The bumper harvest of wheat this spring is an even greater miracle. Last winter, inspired by the bumper harvests of the summer and autumn, the broad masses of commune members had a hundredfold increase in their confidence to strive for even greater harvests, and expanded the winter planting area by more than 100,000 mu. Although Fuqing County did not receive a drop of rain from the beginning of winter until the spring harvest, more than 200,000 mu of wheat still reaped a great harvest. Bumper harvests were achieved not only in the clay-bound plains but also in the sandy hills and alluvial sand areas. The unit area yields on the coast have increased significantly compared to last year. As soon as the spring harvest ended, along the beautiful Longjiang River, the broad Fu-Xia Highway, and the crisscrossing roads in the fields, there appeared convoys of grain-transporting vehicles with red flags waving and drums beating, rushing to complete the state purchase tasks.

    One bumper harvest after another has transformed Fuqing County from a grain-deficient county into a grain-surplus county. In the past, the state needed to supply 20 million jin of grain every year, but now it can transfer out 20 million jin of grain a year. What a huge change!

    The enormous changes have stirred up many painful memories for returned overseas Chinese and their families in Fuqing County. In those long days of "longing for rain without rain, suffering from flooding when it rained" before liberation, how many people abandoned their wives and sold their children, leaving their hometowns and drifting overseas to make a living? Returnees and their families accounted for one-sixth of the county's nearly 500,000 population. In those days, one farmer prayed day and night for rain for agricultural irrigation, even changing his son Xingzhi's name to "Xingshui" (meaning "promote water"), but all this did not bring him rain or harvest. Finally, he painfully sold the family's belongings and sent Xingshui to Nanyang to make a living, instructing him to save money overseas and accumulate some to return home and build water conservancy projects. People who stayed in their hometowns, for the sake of water, either fainted by the waterwheel or lost their lives in fights over water. People from Zhongtian and Jinyin villages in Chengguan Commune shed blood, died, and formed a generations-long feud in the fights…. Today, everything has changed. People no longer need to cry to the heavens, change their names, or fight for water. Instead, they are living a beautiful and happy life forever.

    The "Well of Happiness" has brought grain, fresh fish, electricity… to the people of Fuqing. The hydropower stations that have been built along the dam and main canal have generated electricity. The largest freshwater fish raised in the reservoir weigh more than five jin each. The longan, loquat, banana, and other fruit trees, as well as various scenic forests, planted on both sides of the reservoir dam and along the canals, are already lush with trees…. Dongzhang Reservoir will also become a scenic tourist attraction with green mountains and clear waters.

    “幸福泉”
    本报记者　郭说传
    华侨家乡——福清县的水库流不尽的水，日日夜夜地沿着蛛网似的渠道奔流，哺育着福清辽阔的田地。这股清泉使旱地变成沃土，低产区变成高产区，海滩变成良田；使昔日十年九旱的土地上展现出一片稻海无边、麦浪翻滚、绿树成荫、电线纵横的富饶美丽的景象。人们都把这来自东张水库的水叫作“幸福泉”。
    “幸福泉”是在大跃进的1958年诞生的，这是党和政府为了根本改变福清县连年遭受旱、涝灾害威胁，在1957年底开始兴建的大型水库，总蓄水量达一亿八千多公方。这个水利工程和在这以前已经兴建的三万多处中、小型水利工程结合起来，在福清全县范围内组成了一个农田水利灌溉网。
    去年夏季正是早稻开始孕穗，花生正在扬花，大豆普遍生荚的时候，一连三十多天没有下雨。在这决定夏季收获的关键时刻，东张水库的水来了，润湿着庄稼。当快到收割时，偏偏一连下了四十多天雨，降雨量占了全县正常年全年降雨量的一半，水库的大坝把来自龙江上游群山之间爆发的山洪拦住了。像这样的一旱一涝，要是在解放前，那是一场多么可怕的灾难啊！据历史资料记载：1946年的一次暴雨，洪水淹没了全县十九万亩番薯和水稻，房屋、猪畜、船只的损失更无法计数，而1948年的一次旱灾中，仅平化一个乡就有九十八人饿死，一百四十一人沦为乞丐。可是去年福清县十四万多亩早稻普遍丰收，连向来土壤贫瘠、产量很低的广大沿海地区，都成了战胜旱涝的丰产区。平均亩产量达四百二十斤。
    去年夏季丰收后，秋季又来了大丰收，九万五千多亩晚稻，平均亩产达五百三十斤，比早稻的平均亩产量还多了一百多斤。晚稻的单位面积产量超过早稻也是福清县有史以来第一次。
    今年春季大、小麦的丰收更是一个大奇迹。去年冬季，广大社员在夏秋两季大丰收的鼓舞下，争取更大丰收的信心百倍，一举把冬种面积扩大了十万多亩，虽然从冬季前直到春收止，福清县一滴雨水也没有，然而二十多万亩大小麦却获得了大丰收。不仅在土壤粘结的平原黄土地带，就是在沙多地燥的丘陵以及细沙冲积的地带，均获得丰收。海滨单位面积产量都比去年提高了很多。当春收一结束，秀丽的龙江两岸，宽阔的福厦公路上，纵横交错在田间的大道上，便出现了红旗招展锣鼓喧天的送粮车辆，争先恐后地完成国家统购任务。
    一个连着一个丰收，使福清县从缺粮县变成了余粮县，过去每年需要国家供应二千万斤粮食，现在一年可以调出粮食二千万斤，这是多么大的变化啊！
    巨大的变化撩起了福清县归国华侨、侨眷不少辛酸回忆：在那解放前漫长的“无雨盼雨，雨来苦淹”的日子里，多少人抛妻鬻子背乡离井漂流到海外去谋生，全县近五十万人口中归侨侨眷就占了六分之一。当年有位农民为了农田灌溉日夜祈雨求水，甚至把自己的儿子兴枝改名为“兴水”，然而这一切并没有给他带来雨水和收成，终于忍痛把家里的东西变卖了，将兴水送到南洋去谋生，并嘱咐他在海外要省吃俭用，积累些钱回来修水利；而留在家乡的人为了水，不是昏倒在水车边，就是彼此在争水的械斗中丧命。城关公社中田、金印两村的人在械斗中流了血、死了人，结下了世代冤仇……。如今，一切都变了，人们再用不着为水呼天、改名、械斗了。而是永远过着美好幸福的生活。
    “幸福泉”给福清人民带来了粮食、鲜鱼、电力……从坝头到主干渠沿线已经建成的水电站发电了，水库里放养的淡水鱼最大的每条已有五斤多重，水库坝头两旁和渠道两岸栽种的龙眼、枇杷、香蕉等果树和各种风景林已绿树成荫了……东张水库也将成为一个山青水秀、风景如画的游览胜地。
