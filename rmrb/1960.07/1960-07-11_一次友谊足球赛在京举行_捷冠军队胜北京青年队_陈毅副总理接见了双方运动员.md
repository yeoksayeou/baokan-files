Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: The Czechoslovakian football champion team – Hradec Králové "Spartak" football team, tonight won against the Beijing Youth Football Team by two to one at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie.

　　More than 70,000 spectators watched this first friendly match of the visiting team's China tour. They frequently gave warm applause for the wonderful performances of both the home and visiting teams.

　　The Beijing Youth Team launched a fierce attack in the first half, with several dangerous situations in front of the visiting team's goal. However, almost half an hour into the game, the visiting team scored first in a counterattack. At that time, the visiting team's left inside forward, Zikan, got the ball 30 meters away and dribbled forward. The Beijing Youth Team's goalkeeper, Zhang Junxiu, rushed out to save the ball too early. Zikan took the opportunity to chip the ball towards the empty goal, and the home team's right back, Wang Defa, ran back to save it, but it was too late.

　　After losing a goal, the Beijing Youth Team's offensive did not diminish. Finally, near the end of the first half, the left inside forward, Sun Yunshan, shot fiercely in the melee in front of the visiting team's goal, causing the visiting team's goalkeeper, Indra, who had a good performance, to concede for the first time.

　　The experienced visiting team players were very accurate in passing and intercepting the ball. Compared with the home team, they did not run much in the first half, which allowed them to have ample stamina in the second half to launch frequent attacks from the left, center, and right. The home team's defenders did not mark tightly, so they were in a passive position. When the game went on for eleven minutes, the visiting team's goal-scoring expert, center forward Kvacek, shot another powerful shot into the net, making the score on the field two to one. After that, although the home team launched many counterattacks, the visiting team had strengthened its defense, and the defenders kept a close watch on the home team's fast-running right winger, Cong Zheyu, making it impossible for him, right inside forward Zhang Honggen, center forward Nian Weisizi, and others to cooperate calmly in the attack.

　　After the game, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi met with the athletes of both sides on the field.

　　The visiting team will soon leave Beijing for Shenyang for a friendly visit and match.

　　一次友谊足球赛在京举行
　　捷冠军队胜北京青年队
　　陈毅副总理接见了双方运动员
    新华社10日讯　捷克斯洛伐克足球冠军队——赫拉德茨—克拉洛维“斯巴达克”足球队，今晚在北京工人体育场以二比一赢了北京青年足球队。上半场双方以一比一踢成平局。
    七万多观众观看了客队访华的这场第一次友谊比赛。他们不时为主、客队的精采表演，报以热烈的掌声。
    北京青年队上半场攻势猛烈，客队球门前屡出险象，但比赛进行了快半个钟头时，客队在一次反攻中却首先射入一球。当时，客队左内锋济康在三十米外得球带球前进，北京青年队守门员张俊秀过早冲出扑球，济康乘势将球向空门高挑一脚，主队右后卫王德发往回快跑抢救已来不及。
    北京青年队失球后攻势不减，终于在上半场比赛快结束时，由左内锋孙云山在客队球门前的混战中猛射一球，使有良好表演的客队守门员英德拉第一次失守。
  有经验的客队队员传球、截球都很准确。同主队比较，上半场他们跑动不多，这使得他们在下半场有充沛的体力从左、中、右三路展开频繁的进攻，而主队后卫盯人不紧，因而处于被动。当比赛进行到第十一分钟时，客队射门能手、中锋克瓦切克又劲射一球入网，使场上比分变为二比一。此后，主队虽多次反攻，但客队已加强防守，后卫把主队奔跑快速的右边锋丛者余看得很紧，使他和右内锋张宏根、中锋年维泗等人不能从容配合进攻。
    比赛结束以后，国务院副总理陈毅到球场上接见了双方运动员。
    客队即将离北京去沈阳进行访问比赛。
