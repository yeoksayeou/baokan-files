A Small Story of Supporting Agriculture

    A Newly Met Travel Companion
    Hua Bei Radio Factory Zhang Xinliang

    The army supporting the commune's wheat harvest was about to set off in the morning. I originally wanted to go with them, but in order to complete an automated machine as a gift for "July 1st," I had to leave later.
    I carried my luggage, facing the evening glow, and walked along a wide road. There was no wind at all, and the weather was very hot. I looked around and saw rain clouds surging in the northwest sky. After a flash of lightning, thunder rumbled. Judging from the situation, a shower was about to come. I calculated that it was still more than ten *li* away from the commune, and I felt a little anxious.
    After walking for a while, I came to a triangular intersection and couldn't help but stop. To go to Liupu Village in Happiness Commune, should I go west or east? If I could meet a passerby at this time, that would be great! The wind became stronger, the thunder louder, and rain clouds covered the sky. I stood there blankly.
      "Comrade, where are you going? Are you supporting the commune's wheat harvest?"
    I turned my head and quickly said, "Yes, yes, comrade, how do I get to Liupu Village in Happiness Commune?" I looked at this person: square forehead, square face, high nose, big eyes, thick eyebrows, looking like he was over forty, wearing old blue cloth pants and a plain cloth shirt, neat and tidy, like an old worker.
      "Let's go, we're going the same way!" He pushed his bicycle and walked, a warm smile on his face. Then he asked me, "Which unit are you from?"
      "The radio factory."
      "What's your surname?" he asked with another smile.
      "My surname is Wei."
      "Great, we're lucky, not only are we going the same way, but we also share the same surname!" After a pause, he asked, "How did you come alone?"
    Seeing that this person was very enthusiastic, I said frankly, "Because I wanted to complete an innovation project as a gift for the Party's birthday, so..."
      "Master Wei, you're from a big factory, several hundred of you coming to harvest wheat, wow, you can harvest dozens of *mu* of wheat in a day!" He paused and asked, "Are you here to help with the wheat harvest or to repair farm tools?"
    I smiled and said, "I can do both. Comrade Wei, why are you walking alone?"
    He glanced at me and said with a smile, "We came together, many comrades forgot to bring raincoats and rubber shoes, I'm going back to get them..."
      "Which factory are you from?" I asked.
      "We are, we are from the Industrial Department of the District Committee."
    Hearing "District Committee," I curiously asked again:
  "Did your minister come too?"
      "Of course he came, not to mention the minister, our District Committee Secretary and District Head also came, and yesterday the responsible comrade from the Municipal Committee also came..."
    Bean-sized raindrops fell, and he asked caringly, "Master Wei, did you bring a raincoat?"
    "I didn't bring one, this weather is really unpredictable!"
      "Here, give me your luggage, I'll help you carry it!" As he spoke, he opened the net bag, took out three raincoats, wrapped one around my luggage, put one on himself, and threw one to me: "Here, Master Wei, this one is for you! Bicycles are not allowed to carry people, otherwise it would be great if you could ride!" After speaking, he pedaled the bicycle vigorously and sped away. He also said:
  "Put it on quickly, don't get caught in the rain, you'll feel uncomfortable, and you still have to harvest wheat!" Listening to his kind voice, and looking at the back of this newly met travel companion, a warm current surged in my heart, as if a giant hand was pushing me from behind, and my steps felt lighter.
    I walked in the mud, braving such a big wind and rain... The weather was really strange, and the rain stopped after a while. After the rain, the sky cleared, and the playful stars were jumping happily in the Milky Way. The wind after the rain made people feel so refreshed.
    An hour later, Liupu Village was almost there. I saw a hubbub of voices in the east of the village, and lights illuminated the sky. I seemed to smell the fragrance of wheat, and my hands were itching. I was eager to return the raincoat, retrieve my luggage, and join the night battle. A figure was coming towards me from the house in the east, and I asked, "Comrade, where does Comrade Wei from the Industrial Department of the District Committee live?"
    "Ah, Master Wei? Great, you walked really fast, did your clothes get wet?"
    I took a closer look, and it was the newly met travel companion. He was carrying two large wooden buckets, walking with a wobble. I asked, "Old Wei, what are you carrying?"
      "Sending some boiled water for everyone to drink, would you like a cup?"
    I looked at his age and wanted to take over to carry for him, but he refused, saying, "Today there was a big wind and rain, and running twenty *li* is tiring enough, you go into the first room in the east, have a cup of tea and rest first." I didn't agree and went with him all the way. Don't look down on Comrade Lao Wei for being old, he can pull wheat really fast. He said, "We must harvest quickly, we must not let the heavens take it away!" That night, we harvested dozens more *mu* of wheat.
    When I got back home, it was already very late. As soon as I entered the door, the electric light was broken, and Comrade Lao Wei asked me to light a match, and he fixed it in a moment. I asked, "Comrade Lao Wei, you can also fix this thing?" Before I could finish my sentence, another comrade said, "That's nothing, he can also repair machines and install telephones!"
    Comrade Wei smiled and said, "I learned this from being sent down to several factories as a worker in the past few years, this is what the worker elders taught us!"
    The next day before dawn, someone came to call him to rush to repair agricultural machinery. He ran over before eating breakfast, and I followed him to see if I could help.
    On the way back for lunch, I asked him, "Comrade Wei, you said your minister came too, why haven't I seen him?"
    "Ah, you're asking such a strange question, does the minister have words engraved on his face!" Another comrade said to me.
    I asked again, "Then where is your minister?"
    Comrade Lao Wei smiled slightly and said, "I am!"
    I was stunned, and my ears were buzzing a little. My newly met travel companion turned out to be the Industrial Minister of the District Committee who had gone deep into the front line of the wheat harvest!

    新结识的旅伴
    华北无线电厂　张新良
    支援公社麦收的大军早上就要出发，我本来要和他们一块儿去的，但是，为了要完成一台向“七一”献礼的自动机，只好后走了。
    我背着行李，迎着晚霞，沿着一条宽阔的公路走去。风，一点也没有，天气热得很。我张眼四望，只见西北天上腾涌着雨云，一道闪电过后，响起了雷声。看情景，一场阵雨就要来临。我算了算离公社还有十几里地，心里有点急了。
    走了一阵之后，遇上一个三角交叉路口，我不由得站住了。往幸福公社刘普村去，倒底往西呢还是朝东？如果这时碰上一个过路人多好呢！风更大了，雷声更响了，雨云遍布天际，我呆呆地直发楞。
      “同志，你往哪去？是不是支援公社麦收的？”
    我回过头来连忙说：“对对，同志，到幸福公社刘普村从哪儿走？”我一边打量着这个人：方额角、四方脸，高鼻大眼粗眉毛，看样儿四十出外，下身是条旧蓝布裤子，上身是条素布衬衫，整洁而利落，像个老工人的样子。
      “走，咱俩是同路的！”他推着自行车走了，脸上露出热忱的笑容，接着又问我：“你是那单位的？”
      “无线电厂的。”
      “你贵姓？”他又笑着问。
      “我姓魏。”
      “好，咱俩可碰巧了，不仅是同路，而且又是同姓哩！”停了一下，他又问：“你怎么一个人来了？”
    我一看这人很热情，也就爽朗地说：“因为我要搞完一项向党的生日献礼的革新项目，所以……”
      “魏师傅，你们是大厂，几百人的麦收大军走一趟，好家伙，一天就可以抢几十亩麦子！”他停了停又问：“你去帮麦收还是帮修农具？”
    我笑笑说：“我都能。魏同志你怎么一个人走呀？”
    他瞧了我一眼，笑眯眯地说：“我们是一块来的，好多同志忘了带雨衣和胶鞋，我是回去拿这的……”
      “你们是哪个厂？”我问。
      “我们是，我们是区委工业部的。”
    一听区委的，我就好奇地又问：
  “你们部长也来了吗？”
      “当然来啦，甭说部长了，咱们的区委书记和区长也都来啦，昨天市委负责同志也来了呢……”
    豆大的雨点落下来了，他关心地问：“魏师傅，你带雨衣没有？”
    “我没带，鬼天气真不作谋！”
      “来，你的行李给我，我帮你带去！”说着他打开网袋，取出三件雨衣，一件给我的行李包了起来，一件他自己穿，一件扔给我：“喏，魏师傅这件给你！自行车不准带人，否则你坐上多好呀！”说完他一股劲地蹬着车子，飞驰而去。还说：
  “快穿上吧，别淋了雨，身体不舒服，还要去麦收哩！”我听着他的亲切的声音，我望着这个新结识的旅伴的背影，不由一股温流直涌心头，仿佛有一张巨手在背后推我，我的脚步觉得更轻快了。
    我顶着这么大的风雨，在泥泞的道路上走着……天真怪，一会儿雨又住了。雨过天晴，贪玩的星星又在银河里欢跳着，雨后的风儿使人感到那么痛快。
    一个小时后，刘普村快到了。只见村东头人声喧腾，一片灯火亮遍了天。我仿佛闻到了麦香，我的手痒了。我急想把雨衣还掉，取回行李，参加夜战去。从东头那间屋里正好有个人影迎面而来，我问：“同志，区委工业部的魏同志住在哪间屋？”
    “哎呀，魏师傅吗？好，你走的真快，你淋湿衣服不？”
    我走近一看，正是那位新认识的旅伴。他正挑着两个大木桶，一滑一滑地走来。我问：“老魏，你挑的啥玩艺？”
      “送些开水给大伙喝，你喝一杯？”
    我看看他这把年纪，要抢过来替他挑，他死也不肯，还说：“今天又是大风雨，跑二十来里地够累的，你进这东头第一间房，先喝杯茶休息一下。”我没有同意，便和他一路去了。你别瞧老魏同志年纪大，拔麦子可真快。他说：“咱们一定要快抢快收，决不许老天抢去！”这夜又抢了几十亩麦子。
    回到家里，夜已经很深了。一进门，电灯坏了，老魏同志叫我燃着火柴，他一会就修好了。我问：“老魏同志你还会修这玩艺呢？”没等我的话说完，另一个同志说“这算什么，他还会修机器，装电话哩！”
    魏同志笑了笑：“这是几年来下放了几个厂当工人所学的，这是工人老大哥教给我们的！”
    第二天天没亮，有人来叫他抢修农业机器去。还没吃早饭他就跑去了，我也跟了上去，看看能不能帮帮忙。
    在回去吃中饭的路上，我问他：“魏同志，你说你们部长也来啦，怎么不见呀？”
    “唉，瞧你说的多怪，部长脸上还刻字呀！”另一个同志朝我说。
    我又问：“那你们的部长呢？”
    老魏同志微微地笑着说：“我就是呀！”
    我一下呆住了，耳朵里嗡嗡地有点响。我新结识的旅伴，原来是深入麦收第一线的区委工业部长！
