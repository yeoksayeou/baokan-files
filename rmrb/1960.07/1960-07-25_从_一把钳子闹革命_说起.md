Starting from "A Pair of Pliers Makes Revolution"
	Ren Guang

	Is it necessary to wait for all the necessary conditions to be fully ripe before making revolution? Can a revolution be "made" when the necessary conditions for revolution are not yet fully ripe? Is revolution "made" or "waited" for?

	Regarding this question, clear and forceful answers can be found not only from the past practice of social revolution in our country, but also from the current practice of the technological revolution being carried out by the people of our country. The Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory originally had no technicians and no modern repair equipment. Under such difficult conditions, it seemed unlikely to achieve technological revolution in "one step." However, precisely under such difficult conditions, the workers of this factory fully utilized their revolutionary drive and, relying only on "a pair of pliers to make revolution," achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in a very short period, fundamentally changing the backwardness of manual operation in one fell swoop. Examples like this are everywhere in the technical innovation and technological revolution movement. This is enough to show that we must be determined to become stronger, rely on our own efforts, and actively create conditions and situations conducive to revolution, and not passively wait for the revolutionary situation to arrive on its own or for revolutionary conditions to mature on their own. Conditions are controlled by people, and changing bad conditions and creating good conditions are "made" by people in active, revolutionary activities, rather than passively "waiting" for them.

	This pioneering spirit of "making revolution with a pair of pliers" has become a common style of the Chinese people in the current technological revolution movement. However, among a few people, the question of whether to "make" or "wait" has not been clarified. With the progress of the technological revolution, "wait-and-see" and other "condition-only theories" will still appear in different forms under different circumstances. For example, after the technological revolution has achieved certain successes, should we continue to create new revolutionary conditions and advance victoriously, or should we think that technological development has reached a certain limit, its potential has been exhausted, and we have to wait for new conditions to mature before we can "make" more progress? Such issues of "making" and "waiting," continuous revolution and stagnation, still exist. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly resolve the relationship between objective conditions and subjective conditions. Should we be slaves to objective conditions, or masters of objective conditions? Should we stop the revolution, or continuously revolutionize?

	For making revolution, it depends not only on objective conditions, but also on subjective conditions, that is, on whether we have revolutionary ideas, theories, and so on. Marxists attach the greatest importance to objective conditions, because Marxists are the most thorough materialists. But Marxists are also dialectical materialists, so they will never ignore the active role of subjective conditions because of their emphasis on objective conditions. Lenin said, "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." In his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," he also said: "Revolution is realized by the consciousness, will, enthusiasm, and ideals of millions of people who are motivated by the sharpest class struggle (the revolution in production struggle is also the same—the author), at a time when all human intelligence is particularly high and intense." It can be seen that, in a certain sense, subjective factors play a decisive role in revolution.

	In the winding work of the transformer workshop of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, the original production conditions were backward. There were no machines, and everything was done manually. Therefore, a few people believed that "there are no conditions to make revolution." They said: "Manual work, manual work, the brain cannot move, no matter what, it is still manual work." Under the leadership of the Party committee, the old worker Ye Jintao made a revolution with two foreign nails, realizing the mechanization of folding paper. At the same time, due to the daring and hard work of the winding workers, the paper wrapping machine was converted to electrical control, which profoundly changed the production appearance of the entire work section. Therefore, the workers came to the opposite conclusion: "Manual work, manual work, back pain and soreness, if you don't want pain and soreness, the brain needs to move more, manual becomes motorized, motorized becomes automatic." Starting from the common premise of "manual work, manual work," two opposite conclusions were drawn: one was the conclusion of wanting revolution, which resulted in a profound change in the production appearance of the entire work section; the other was the conclusion of not wanting revolution, and if it were followed, the result would only be "still manual work." Truth is often so close to fallacy. But from here, an extremely beneficial practical conclusion can be drawn: It is up to man to decide. This is an irrefutable truth of Marxism-Leninism. We often see such a situation, that is, under the same conditions, work results are good and bad; relatively poor results can be achieved under good conditions, and good results can be achieved under poor conditions. Whether it is good or bad all depends on "man." For revolution, under certain conditions, the question is whether people want revolution, not whether they can revolution.

	In the struggle for production, production tools are certainly an important factor in production, but not the decisive factor. If we have to wait until we have the latest and best technical equipment before making a technological revolution, then where does the latest and best technical equipment come from? For example, in the face of "a pair of pliers," if viewed from a mechanistic point of view, a pair of pliers can only be a pair of pliers forever, and manual operation can only be manual operation forever. But once the revolutionary drive of the masses is brought into play, mechanization and semi-mechanization can be quickly achieved with a pair of pliers. Here, the decisive factor is "man" not "things."

	The same is true in class struggle and military struggle. If we have to wait until we have the latest and best weapons before daring to fight the enemy, wouldn't it be the same as disarming ourselves? Chairman Mao said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is man, not matter. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic power, but also a comparison of manpower and morale. Military and economic power must be wielded by people." (On Protracted War) Although the atomic bomb is a new type of weapon for mass slaughter, only the people, not one or two new weapons, can play a decisive role in the outcome of the war. In war, weapons are wielded by people, it is people who wield weapons, not weapons that "wield" people. Imperialism and all reactionaries who launch unjust wars, although they possess new weapons, have lost popular support, and the military is tired of war, and everyone opposes them. In the end, they are bound to fail. Therefore, imperialism and all reactionaries appear to be powerful, but in reality they are paper tigers.

	Marxism requires people to be masters of objective conditions, not slaves to objective conditions. In the face of objective conditions, we must adopt a dialectical materialist attitude, not a metaphysical attitude. On the issue of revolution, on the one hand, we must despise the enemy strategically, despise difficulties, and dare to revolt; on the other hand, we must value the enemy tactically, value difficulties, and be good at revolution. If people are slaves to objective conditions, they will not dare to revolt. If they do not value objective conditions tactically, they will not be able to revolt well.

	Marxists believe that things are constantly moving, developing, and changing, and therefore believe that the development of technology is endless. Making a technological revolution means constantly changing old material conditions and creating new material conditions. Revolution cannot stop and must advance from one stage to another. In the technological revolution movement, for all new creations and inventions, there must be a process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, and continuous improvement must be based on consolidation and promotion; conversely, at the same time, consolidation, promotion, and popularization work must be carried out continuously under the guidance of continuous improvement. In this dialectical process of popularization and improvement, the revolution has no end, and the upstream has no limit. Therefore, no new achievement that has been achieved can be regarded as the peak of possibility, as the revolution has reached its peak. Revolution cannot only "wait," but it cannot stop. Revolution must not only "make," but also constantly "make."

	The development of production technology also means the development of the active relationship between man and nature. The laws of nature are endless, and the possibility of human understanding and utilization of the laws of nature is also endless, with no peak. If the new achievements that have been achieved in science and technology are regarded as the peak of possibility, the revolution will stop, which is a manifestation of metaphysical ideas. The development of things is always a process of development from elementary to advanced. On the one hand, everything always has a stage, a limit, and an edge; ignoring this aspect of things is wrong. On the other hand, after each new stage, a newer stage will appear. When a possibility becomes a reality, the possibility of a newer reality will appear. From this point of view, the revolution is endless. When a pair of pliers makes mechanization and semi-mechanization, the possibility of realizing automation and semi-automation will become a reality. Therefore, the matter depends not only on whether to make revolution, but also on whether to continuously revolutionize.

	In short, conditions are created in the process of "making," not matured by simply "waiting." The possibility of becoming a reality must be achieved through "making," that is, struggle and practice. Chairman Mao said in "On Protracted War": "The outcome of a war is certainly determined by the military, political, economic, geographical, war nature, international assistance, and other conditions of both sides, but it is not only determined by these; only these are only the possibility of winning or losing, and it does not determine winning or losing itself. To determine winning or losing, we must also add subjective efforts, that is, guiding the war and implementing the war, which is the conscious activity in the war." It should be seen that to make a revolution, there are always favorable conditions and unfavorable conditions, there is a possibility of success, and there is also a possibility of temporary failure. The key issue is that we give play to subjective initiative, fully utilize and create favorable conditions, overcome unfavorable conditions, and strive to transform the possibility of success into reality. If we think that there is a possibility of success and "sit back and relax" and "wait for dawn," then the result will not be the transformation of the possibility of success into reality, but the transformation of the possibility of failure into reality. Marxism-Leninism is a revolutionary doctrine, not a doctrine of "waiting." In the current great technological revolution movement, no matter what the conditions of each specific unit, one thing is certain, that is, revolution can be made everywhere, and everyone can make revolution. Revolution can be made in large enterprises with modern equipment, and revolution needs to be made; in those small enterprises, "a pair of pliers" can also make a big revolution, but to make a revolution, we must not only dare to make a revolution and be full of energy, but also be good at making a revolution and be down-to-earth. This is the inspiration gained from the communist style of "making revolution with a pair of pliers."

    从“一把钳子闹革命”说起
    任光
    闹革命，是否要等待一切必要条件完全成熟？在革命的必要条件还没有完全成熟时，能不能“闹”成呢？革命是“闹”出来的还是“等”出来的？
    关于这个问题，不但从过去我国的社会革命的实践，而且从现时我国人民正在进行的技术革命的实践，都可以找到明确而有力的答复。上海志成兴钢铁制品厂，原来没有一个技术人员，没有一点现代化的修造设备，在这样艰难的条件下，要想进行技术革命，“一步登天”，看来是很少可能性的。但正是在这样艰难的条件下，这个厂的职工们充分发挥了革命干劲，只凭“一把钳子闹革命”，结果在很短的时间内实现了机械化、半机械化，一举而根本改变了手工操作的落后面貌。像这样的例子，在技术革新和技术革命运动中是到处有的。这就足以说明，要发愤图强，自力更生，积极地创造有利于革命的条件和形势，而不能坐等革命形势自行到来，革命条件自行成熟。条件是由人来掌握的，改变差的条件和创造好的条件，是由人们在积极的、革命的活动中“闹”出来的，而不是消极地“等”出来的。
    这种“一把钳子闹革命”的首创精神，在当前的技术革命运动中，已经成为我国人民的普遍的风格了。但是在少数人中，对于是“闹”还是“等”的问题，并非都已弄清楚了。随着技术革命的进展，“等待”之类的“唯条件论”，还会在不同的形势下以不同的形式出现。比如，在技术革命取得一定的成就之后，是继续创造新的革命条件，乘胜前进呢，还是认为技术的发展已经到了一定的限度，潜力已尽，要再“闹”就得等新条件成熟呢？这样的“闹”和“等”，不断革命和停顿不前的问题，还是有的。因此，必须彻底解决客观条件和主观条件的关系问题。是做客观条件的奴隶呢，还是做客观条件的主人？是停顿革命呢，还是不断革命？
    对于闹革命来说，不但在于客观条件，而且在于主观条件，即在于是否具有革命的思想、理论等等。马克思主义者是最重视客观条件的，因为马克思主义者是最彻底的唯物主义者。但马克思主义者同时是唯物辩证法论者，所以决不因重视客观条件而忽略主观条件的能动作用。列宁说过，“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”他在《共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病》一书中又说：“革命却是在人的一切聪明才智特别高涨和紧张的时候，由千百万被最尖锐的阶级斗争（生产斗争中的革命也是如此——引者）所激励的人的意识、意志、热情和理想来实现的。”可见，在一定的意义上，主观因素对于革命起决定的作用。
    上海电机厂变压器车间绕线工段的绕线工作中，原来的生产条件落后，一没有机器，二都是手工。因此就有少数人认为，“没有条件闹革命”。他们说：“手加工，手加工，脑筋无法动，无论如何，还是手加工。”而在党委的领导下，老工人叶锦涛用两只洋钉闹成了革命，使折纸实现了机械化。同时，由于绕线工人们的敢想敢干，将包纸机改为电气控制，使全工段的生产面貌起了深刻的变化。于是工人们得出了相反的结论：“手加工，手加工，腰酸背又痛，要不酸又不痛，脑筋更要动，手工变机动，机动变自动”。从“手加工，手加工”这个共同的前提出发，竟然得出了两种相反的结论：一种是要革命的结论，结果使全工段的生产面貌起了深刻的变化；一种是不要革命的结论，如果照了做去，结果只能“还是手加工”。真理竟然是这样地常常与谬误为邻。但从这里可以得出一个极为有益的实际结论：事在人为。这是一条马克思列宁主义的颠扑不破的真理。我们常常看到这样一种情况，即在相同的条件下，工作成绩有好有坏；在好的条件下可以做出比较差的成绩，在差的条件下可以做出好的成绩。为好为坏，无不在于“人为”。对于革命来说，在一定的条件下，问题在于人们要不要革命，不在于能不能革命。
    在生产斗争中，生产工具固然是生产中的重要因素，但不是决定的因素。如果要等到有了最新最好的技术装备再来闹技术革命的话，那末，最新、最好的技术装备又从何而来？比如在“一把钳子”面前，如果从机械论的观点看来，则一把钳子就只能永远是一把钳子，手工操作就只能永远是手工操作。可是一旦发挥了群众的革命干劲，凭着一把钳子就迅速闹出了机械化、半机械化。在这里，起决定作用的是“人”不是“物”。
    在阶级斗争和军事斗争也是这样，如果要等到有了最新、最好的武器才敢同敌人打仗的话，不就等于自己给自己解除了武装吗？毛主席说过：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”（《论持久战》）像原子弹固然是一种大规模屠杀的新式武器，可是对战争胜负起决定作用的只能是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。在战争中，武器是由人来掌握的，是人在掌握武器，而不是武器“掌握”人。发动非正义战争的帝国主义和一切反动派，虽则拥有新式武器，但是大失人心，军心厌战，人人反对，最后终归是要失败的。所以，帝国主义和一切反动派，貌似强大，实际是一只纸老虎。
    马克思主义要求人们要作客观条件的主人，不要作客观条件的奴隶。在客观条件面前，要采取辩证唯物主义的态度，不要采取形而上学的态度。在革命问题上，一方面在战略上要藐视敌人，要藐视困难，要敢于革命；另一方面在战术上又要重视敌人，要重视困难，要善于革命。人们如果当客观条件的奴隶，就会不敢革命，如果在战术上不重视客观条件，也不能做到善于革命。
    马克思主义者认为事物是不断的运动、发展、变化的，因而也认为技术的发展是无止境的。闹技术革命，就是要不断地改变旧的物质条件、创造新的物质条件。革命不能停顿，必须一个阶段接一个阶段地向前推进。在技术革命运动中，对于一切新的创造发明来说，必须有一个巩固、推广和提高的过程，必须在巩固、推广的基础上不断地提高；反之，又同时必须是在不断提高的指导下，不断地进行巩固、推广和普及的工作。在这种普及和提高的辩证过程中，革命是没有尽头的，上游是没有止境的。因此不能把任何已经达到的新成就，当作可能性的顶点，当作革命到了顶点。革命不仅不能“等待”，而且不能停顿。革命不仅要“闹”，而且要不断地“闹”。
    生产技术的发展，同时意味着人对于自然界的能动关系的发展。自然规律是无穷无尽的，人对于自然规律的认识和利用的可能性也是无穷无尽的，没有顶点的。如果把科学技术上已经达到的新成就当作可能性的顶点，就会使革命停顿下来，这是形而上学观念的表现。事物的发展总是一个由初级到高级的发展过程。一方面，任何事情总要有一个阶段，有一个限度，有一个边；忽略了事情的这一方面是错误的。另一方面，紧接着每一个新的阶段之后，就会出现一个更新的阶段，当一种可能性变成了现实的时候，更新的现实的可能性就会出现。从这一方面来说，革命又是没有尽头的。当一把钳子闹出了机械化、半机械化以后，实现自动化、半自动化的可能性就会变为现实的了。因此事情不仅决定于要不要革命，而且决定于要不要不断革命。
    总之，条件都是要在“闹”的过程中创造出来的，不是从单纯“等待”中成熟起来的。可能性变为现实，是要经过“闹”，也就是斗争、实践才能达到的。毛主席在《论持久战》中说：“战争的胜负，固然决定于双方军事、政治、经济、地理、战争性质、国际援助诸条件，然而不仅仅决定于这些；仅有这些，还只是有了胜负的可能性，它本身没有分胜负。要分胜负，还须加上主观的努力，这就是指导战争和实行战争，这就是战争中的自觉的能动性。”应该看到，要闹革命，总是有有利条件，也有不利条件，有成功的可能，也有暂时失败的可能。关键问题在于我们发挥主观能动性，充分利用和创造有利条件，克服不利条件，争取把成功的可能性转化为现实性。如果以为有了成功的可能性而“高枕无忧”、“坐以待旦”，那末，结果就不会是成功的可能性转化为现实，而是失败的可能性转化为现实了。马克思列宁主义是革命的学说，不是“等待”的学说。在当前伟大的技术革命运动中，不管各个具体单位的条件如何，有一点是可以肯定的，这就是处处可以闹革命，人人可以闹革命。在现代化装备的大企业里可以闹革命，需要闹革命；在那些小企业里，“一把钳子”也可以大闹革命，但闹革命，既要敢于革命，干劲冲天；又要善于革命，脚踏实地。这就是从“一把钳子闹革命”的共产主义风格中所得到的启示。
