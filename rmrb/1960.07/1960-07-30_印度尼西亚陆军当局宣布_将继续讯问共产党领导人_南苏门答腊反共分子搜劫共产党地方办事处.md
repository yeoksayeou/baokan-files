Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, Jakarta News: Lieutenant Edi, spokesperson for the Jakarta wartime authority, announced on the 28th that the Jakarta wartime authority's "preliminary interrogation" of Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau members Lukman, Yudo, and Sutisman, regarding the Central Committee Political Bureau's statement of July 8th, had concluded. However, Edi said that the "interrogation" of Indonesian Communist Party Chairman Aidit had not yet concluded.

Edi said that at the conclusion of the "preliminary interrogation," a "second stage of interrogation" would begin.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: According to an Antara News Agency report from Palembang on the 28th, on the evening of July 26th, eight unidentified individuals raided the office of the Indonesian Communist Party's local committee in Palembang, South Sumatra.

According to reports, these eight individuals arrived in an unidentified vehicle, carrying placards defaming the Indonesian Communist Party.

The news agency stated that one person in the office at the time was injured while resisting the terrorists, and the extent of the losses is currently unknown.

According to the Indonesian News Agency, prior to this terrorist act, members of several parties, including the Masyumi Party, the Indonesian Socialist Party, and the Indonesian Labour Party, held an anti-communist demonstration in Palembang on the same day. They clamored for a ban on the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau's statement of July 8th regarding the work cabinet.

According to Jakarta newspapers, the Jakarta wartime authority ordered the Indonesian Communist Party's "People's Daily" weekly "Sports and Film" to cease publication starting with the next issue, July 31st, on the grounds that it published a press release from the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat on July 24th regarding the Jakarta wartime authority's "summons" of the Party Central Committee leaders. "People's Daily" itself was already ordered to cease publication indefinitely on July 16th, on the grounds that it published the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau's statement of July 8th.

    印度尼西亚陆军当局宣布
    将继续讯问共产党领导人
    南苏门答腊反共分子搜劫共产党地方办事处
    新华社29日讯　雅加达消息：雅加达战时掌权部发言人埃迪中尉28日宣布，雅加达战时掌权部就印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局7月8日声明对这个党的中央委员会政治局委员鲁克曼、约多和苏蒂斯曼的“初步讯问”已经结束。但是，埃迪说，对印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地的“讯问”还没有结束。
    埃迪说，在“初步讯问”结束的时候，“第二阶段的讯问”将开始进行。
    新华社29日讯　据安塔拉通讯社28日自巨港报道，7月26日晚上有八名来历不明的人搜劫了南苏门答腊巨港的印度尼西亚共产党地方委员会的办公处。
    据报道，这八个人是乘坐一部来历不明的汽车前往的，他们还带着诽谤印度尼西亚共产党的标语牌。
    这家通讯社说，当时在办公处的一个人在抵抗恐怖分子时受了伤，现在还不知道所受损失的规模。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，在发生这次恐怖行动以前，当天曾经发生马斯友美党、印度尼西亚社会党、印度尼西亚工党等一些党派的成员在巨港举行反共示威的事件。他们叫嚣要禁止印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局7月8日发表的关于工作内阁工作的声明。
    据雅加达报纸报道，雅加达战时掌权部命令印度尼西亚共产党的“人民日报”的星期刊“体育与电影”周刊从下一期，即从7月31日起停刊，理由是它在7月24日刊登了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处关于雅加达战时掌权部“传唤”党中央领导人的新闻公报。“人民日报”本身已经被勒令于7月16日无定期停刊，理由是刊登了印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局7月8日的声明。
