Concentrate Superior Forces to Vigorously Grasp Field Management
By People's Daily Commentator

    High summer is the busiest season for field management. Spring-sown crops are in their vigorous growth period and require strengthened management; summer-sown crops are emerging one after another and also need timely management. This year, the sown areas of both spring-sown and summer-sown crops have increased compared to last year, which is a great achievement made by Chinese farmers under the leadership of the Party. Precisely because of this, the task of field management has become heavier. This year, there has been a lot of rain in the Northeast, and some farmland could not be weeded and cultivated in time, resulting in weed infestation. In some areas of North China, field management was not done meticulously because efforts were concentrated on fighting drought. In the rice-growing areas of the South, some farmland lacks sufficient fertilizer. In short, in many areas, there are still some urgent problems in field management that need to be resolved, and special attention should be paid to them.
    Field management is an intense race against time. To win this battle, we must concentrate absolutely superior forces. We should rationally allocate labor, resolutely shorten the battle lines, and concentrate all available forces on current agricultural production, especially field management. Qinghai Province recently held a field management broadcast conference, requiring all localities to invest more than 70% of the rural labor force in field management, vigorously grasp measures such as weeding and topdressing, and strive to manage the high-yield plots well. This approach is very necessary. Focusing the main force on the cutting edge is the primary condition for doing a good job in field management.
    There are many tasks in field management, including cultivating and weeding, topdressing, watering, and also being prepared to fight against natural disasters such as drought, floods, wind, and insects at any time. Which task is the main one depends on the specific situation. But for most areas, the focus of current field management is weeding and topdressing. Summer temperatures are high, and there is a lot of rain, so weeds grow rapidly. If the seedlings are suppressed by weeds, it will be impossible to obtain a good harvest. Cultivation should be done early, and weeding must be thorough, so we should seize the time. Whether or not there is enough fertilizer is the key to completing the task of increasing production. This year, many places lack sufficient base fertilizer, and if more topdressing is not applied, it will be difficult to achieve a good harvest. Even those high-yield fields that have been applied with more base fertilizer should be topdressed in time to truly achieve high yields. We must seize the opportunity to accumulate and produce fertilizer on a large scale, and apply it to the fields in a timely manner according to the soil quality and the growth of the crops.
    Many areas are promoting the experience of the "two-five system" leadership method of Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, and sending a large number of cadres to strengthen specific leadership at the forefront. This is an important guarantee for doing a good job in summer production, including field management. Like these comrades, by being down-to-earth, working hard, going deep into the fields, going deep among the masses, participating in production, and leading production, we will surely achieve a great victory in field management.

　　集中优势力量狠抓田间管理
　　本报评论员
    盛夏是田间管理工作最繁重的季节。春播作物正在生长旺期，需要加强管理；夏播作物陆续出苗，也要及时管理。今年春播作物和夏播作物的播种面积，都比去年有所增加，这是我国农民在党的领导下取得的伟大成绩。正是因为这样，田间管理的任务就加重了。今年东北地区雨水多，有些农田不能及时铲趟，发生了草荒现象。华北有的地区因为集中力量抗旱，田间管理作的不细。南方水稻地区，有些农田肥料不足。总之，不少地区在田间管理方面，还有一些迫切需要解决的问题，应该特别加以注意。
    田间管理是一场紧张的抢时间的斗争。要打胜这一仗，必须集中绝对优势的力量。我们应该合理安排劳动力，坚决缩短战线，把一切可以抽调的力量，集中到当前的农业生产，特别是田间管理上来。青海省最近召开了田间管理广播大会，要求各地把农村70％以上的劳动力投入田间管理，狠抓除草、追肥等措施，努力管好丰产方。这种作法是非常必要的。把主要力量用在刀刃上，是搞好田间管理的首要条件。
    田间管理，事情很多，既要中耕除草，又要追肥、浇水，还要随时准备同旱、涝、风、虫等自然灾害作斗争。哪个任务为主，视具体情况而定。但对多数地区来说，当前田间管理的重点是除草、追肥。夏季气温高，雨水多，草苗争长，如果苗受草欺，就无法获得好收成。中耕宜早，除草务尽，应该抓紧。上的肥料足不足，是能不能完成增产任务的关键。今年不少地方基肥不足，如果再不多上追肥，就难望得到好收成了。就是那些上了较多基肥的丰产田，也要及时追肥，才能真正丰产。我们一定要抓紧时机，大规模积肥造肥，根据土质和庄稼的生长情况，适时上到地里。
    许多地区推广河北吴桥县“二五制”领导方法的经验，派出大批干部，加强第一线的具体领导。这是搞好包括田间管理在内的夏季生产的重要保证。像这些同志们一样，脚踏实地，埋头苦干，深入田间，深入群众，参加生产，领导生产，一定能够取得田间管理的大胜利。
