Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Hunan Province is mobilizing a large amount of manpower and materials from all walks of life to support the rush harvest of early rice and the rush transplanting of late rice.

In this support army, there are tens of thousands of state organ personnel who are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, leaving their offices and going deep into the front line of production. The cadres of provincial-level organs who have been approved to go to the countryside have departed successively. In the Qianyang Special Zone, more than 5,000 government cadres have gone to the countryside to support the "Double Rush." In the Chenxian Special Zone, where the season started earlier, government cadres have already joined the intense battle of the "Double Rush." After the cadres went to the countryside, they conscientiously ate, lived, labored, and consulted with the masses, grasping both production and life, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the commune members for labor.

Workers are not only actively rushing to manufacture various "Double Rush" tools and transporting "Double Rush" materials, but also dispatching their own teams to the front line of the "Double Rush" to fight alongside peasant brothers. Of the 50,000-strong army from Changsha City that went to the countryside to support the "Double Rush," nearly 20,000 were workers. They carried various repair tools with them, participating in the "Double Rush" while repairing tools for the peasants. In Chenxian County, workers, in addition to sending people to the countryside to support the "Double Rush," also put forward the slogan "Produce whatever is needed for the Double Rush, produce as much as is needed." In five days, they manufactured and repaired more than 110,000 pieces of various tools, large and small. Industrial departments and other departments throughout the province also organized nearly 7,000 repair stations and more than 10,000 mobile repair teams, adopting a method combining fixed-point zoning with going from village to village and door to door, going deep into canteens and fields, repairing on the spot, repairing as soon as something broke, and using tools as soon as they were repaired.

On the financial and trade front, employees vigorously organized the production and supply of "Double Rush" tools before the "Double Rush," giving full play to the role of the production logistics department. Hardware and native product companies in Hengyang City sent people to the countryside to investigate demand, and then tried every means to meet the needs in a timely manner. The commercial system in Xiangxiang County recently added 15 supply points and 400 peddler's loads. Their slogan is: the field is the market, the field ridge is the counter, supply whatever is needed, and have it whenever it is needed.

The cultural, educational, and health fronts have also launched a wave of support for the "Double Rush." After completing this semester's teaching work, teachers and students throughout the province enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and successively went to the production front. So far, according to preliminary statistics from Changde, Xiangtan, Changsha and other regions, more than 1.9 million teachers and students from middle schools and above, and some older elementary school students, have gone to the communes and worked with the commune members.

Xinhua News Agency: Various areas in Fujian Province are taking measures that combine leadership and the masses, workers and peasants, to vigorously grasp the manufacture, promotion, maintenance and use of "three machines" (namely, harvesters, threshers, and rice transplanters), turning manufacture, promotion, use, repair and management into a single force, fully supporting the rural summer harvest and summer planting, and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.

In the mass production of "three machines," all localities have paid special attention to ensuring product quality. Fuzhou City, which undertakes two-thirds of the province's task of manufacturing rapid harvester blades, has formed inspection teams to help factories grasp production progress and quality. As of the 15th, most of the more than 240,000 blades manufactured in the city met the quality requirements. Many counties have also adopted a three-way combination method of leadership, workers, and peasants, implementing side-by-side manufacturing, trial runs, and improvements to continuously improve the quality of the "three machines."

While mass-producing the "three machines," all localities have also generally carried out inspection and maintenance work on the original "three machines." In Minhou County, the county party committee's industry secretary took the lead, drawing on more than 130 people including the county industry bureau chief, agricultural machinery bureau chief, commune party committee secretaries, factory directors of commune-run agricultural machinery factories, and technicians, to form five inspection groups to go to the communes and teams to help commune members conduct a major inspection of the existing "three machines." In Jianxin and other communes, they found that the quality of 210 rice transplanters was not high, so they organized workers to renovate and repair them on the spot. Finally, it was determined that 195 of them met the quality requirements.

    湖南各界全面支援抢收抢插
    福建工人狠抓收种农具制造质量
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省各行各业抽调大批人力、物力，支援抢收早稻和抢插晚稻。
    在这支支援大军中，有成千上万的国家机关工作人员，他们热烈响应省委的号召，走出办公室，深入生产第一线。省级机关被批准下乡的干部已先后出发。在黔阳专区，有五千多机关干部下乡支援“双抢”。在季节较早的郴县专区，机关干部们已经投入了火热的“双抢”战斗。干部下到农村后，认真作到了和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，既抓生产，又抓生活，大大激发了社员的劳动积极性。
    工人们不仅积极赶制各种“双抢”工具，运送“双抢”物资，并且派出自己的队伍到“双抢”前线去和农民兄弟并肩作战。长沙市下乡支援“双抢”的五万大军中，就有近两万名工人。他们随身带有各种修理工具，一边参加“双抢”，一边给农民修理工具。郴县的工人们除了派人下乡支援“双抢”外，还提出“双抢需要什么就生产什么，需要多少就生产多少”的行动口号，五天制造和修理了各种大小工具十一万多件。全省各地工业等部门还组织修配站近七千个，流动修配组一万多个，采取划片定点与穿村过户相结合的方法，深入食堂、田间，就地整修，随坏随修，随修随用。
    财贸战线的职工们在“双抢”前夕，大力组织“双抢”工具的生产和供应，充分发挥了生产后勤部的作用。衡阳市五金、土产等公司都派人深入农村调查要货情况，然后千方百计及时满足需要。湘乡县的商业系统最近增设了十五个供应点，增加了四百副货郎担，他们的口号是：田间当商场，田塍当柜台，需要什么供应什么，什么时候要什么时候有。
    文教卫生战线也掀起了支援“双抢”的热潮，全省学校师生在结束这学期的教学工作后，热烈响应党的号召，陆续开赴生产前线。到目前止，据常德、湘潭、长沙市等地区的初步统计，已有一百九十多万名中学以上的师生和部分年龄较大的小学生，下到公社和社员一起劳动。
    据新华社讯　福建省各地采取领导与群众结合、工人和农民结合，大抓“三机”（即收割机、脱谷机和插秧机）的制造、推广、维修和使用，把制、推、用、修、管拧成一股绳，全力支援农村夏收夏种，加速农业技术改造。
    各地在大造“三机”中，都特别重视保证产品质量。承担全省快速收割器刀片制造任务三分之二的福州市，已经组成检查组到各厂帮助抓生产进度和质量。全市到15日止，已制成的二十四万多片刀片，绝大部分符合质量要求。许多县还采取领导、工人和农民三结合办法，实行边制边试边改进，不断提高“三机”质量。
    各地在大造“三机”的同时，对原有“三机”也普遍进行检查维修工作。闽侯县由县委工业书记挂帅，抽调了县工业局长、农械局长和各公社党委书记、各社办农械厂厂长、技术工人等一百三十多人，组成五个检查团，到各社、队帮助社员对现有“三机”进行大检查。他们在建新等公社发现有二百一十台插秧机质量不高，便组织工人就地改造维修，最后鉴定，已有一百九十五台达到质量要求。
