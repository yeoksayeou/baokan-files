Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th dispatch: The Japanese Kishida Nobusuke government's Foreign Ministry released a diplomatic blue book on July 3rd, stating that Japan would rely on the Japan-US military alliance treaty to promote a reactionary foreign policy of further subservience to the United States, intensifying the Cold War and aggression.

The Kishida Nobusuke government, already on the verge of collapse under the attack of the increasingly powerful struggle of the Japanese people, issued this diplomatic document, obviously in accordance with the will of US imperialism, to formulate a diplomatic policy for the next cabinet to succeed the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, and is part of a conspiracy to organize a "second Kishida Nobusuke cabinet."

The diplomatic blue book, in analyzing the international situation of the past year, acknowledges that "In Africa, many independent countries have been born one after another," and that "these are characteristics that have emerged since last year."

However, the diplomatic blue book tries its best to propagate that "the struggle between the Eastern and Western camps has not shown any clear signs of relaxation," and that "there are still large differences in the ideas of the East and West on issues such as disarmament and the Berlin issue, and it will not be easy to resolve the many outstanding issues."

In this diplomatic blue book, the Kishida Nobusuke government advocates that Western countries must strengthen their collusion and continue to pursue a "position of strength" policy backed by military blocs. The blue book states that: currently, "in the context of the collective security guarantee system that has been formed between the East and West, unless free countries establish and maintain strong cooperative relations on the basis of mutual understanding and trust, they cannot effectively negotiate with the Communist side." It also says that the aggressive Japan-US military alliance treaty "was concluded with the United States on this basis."

The blue book reiterates Japan's policy of "not taking neutrality," stating that "the key to Japanese diplomacy is to maintain its position as a member of the free world."

In order to accelerate the formal establishment of a Northeast Asian military alliance in accordance with US strategic requirements, the Kishida Nobusuke government also stated in the diplomatic blue book that "especially to expedite" the "normalization of relations" between Japan and South Korea.

When talking about Japan's relations with China, the blue book insists on the current policy of hostility towards China. On the one hand, it releases the deceptive air that adjusting relations with China is a future task of Japanese diplomacy, while on the other hand, it emphasizes that "the adjustment of Japan-China relations contains many factors that need to be resolved in the world political trend."

The Kishida Nobusuke government, which deliberately undermines Japan-China relations, not only does not show any change in attitude in the blue book, but also slanders China for adopting a "high-pressure posture," and even wants China to "make efforts to remove obstacles." This can only further expose the Kishida Nobusuke government's despicable face of subservience to the United States and hostility towards China.

In order to promote the conspiracy of expanding into Southeast Asia and other regions, the Kishida Nobusuke government also conceals in the blue book the guilt of Japanese militarism in causing heavy disasters to the people of Asian countries, saying that Japan's war reparations to Asian countries have all ended with the Japan-South Vietnam compensation agreement that came into effect at the beginning of this year as the end point.

### 岸政府在倒台前夕发表外交蓝皮书  日本要继续当美国侵略帮凶

    岸政府在倒台前夕发表外交蓝皮书
    日本要继续当美国侵略帮凶
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介政府外务省3日发表外交蓝皮书，表示日本要依靠日美军事同盟条约，推行进一步屈从美国、加剧冷战与侵略的反动外交政策。
    在日本人民日益强大的斗争打击下已经处于倒台前夕的岸信介政府发表这个外交文件，显然是秉承美帝国主义意志，为接替岸信介内阁的下届新内阁制定外交方针，是组织“第二个岸信介内阁”的阴谋的一部分。
    外交蓝皮书在分析最近一年的国际形势时承认：“在非洲，许多独立国家相继诞生”，“这些是从去年开始出现的特点”。
    但是，外交蓝皮书竭力宣传，
  “东西方阵营之间的斗争并没有表现出放松的明确迹象”，“诸如裁军问题和柏林问题等东西双方的想法还有很大的分歧，不会很容易地解决悬而未决的许多问题”。
    岸信介政府在这个外交蓝皮书中鼓吹西方国家必须加强勾结，继续推行以军事集团为后盾的“实力地位”政策。蓝皮书里的说法是：目前“在东西双方的集体安全保障体制已经形成的背景下，除非自由国家站在相互理解和信任的基础上来建立和保持强有力的合作关系，就不能有效地同共产方面进行谈判”。它并且说，侵略性的日美军事同盟条约“就是在这个基础上”同美国缔结的。
    蓝皮书重申日本“不采取中立”政策，它说：“日本外交的关键是保持作为自由世界一员的立场”。
    为了根据美国战略要求，加紧正式建立东北亚军事联盟，岸信介政府在外交蓝皮书中还说：“特别是要尽速”使日本同南朝鲜的“邦交正常化”。
    当谈到日本同中国的关系时，蓝皮书坚持敌对中国的现行政策。它一面放出调整同中国关系是日本外交今后课题的骗人空气，一面又强调说：“日中关系的调整包含着许多需要在世界政治潮流中去解决的因素”。
    蓄意破坏日中关系的岸信介政府，在蓝皮书中不仅丝毫没有改变态度的表示，反而诬蔑中国采取
  “高压姿势”，竟然要中国“努力铲除障碍”。这只能进一步暴露岸信介政府屈从美国、敌视中国的卑鄙面目。
    岸信介政府为了推行向东南亚等地区扩张的阴谋，还在蓝皮书中掩饰日本军国主义曾经给亚洲各国人民造成惨重灾害的罪责，说什么日本对亚洲国家的战争赔偿以今年初生效的日本对南越的赔偿协定为终点已经全部结束。
