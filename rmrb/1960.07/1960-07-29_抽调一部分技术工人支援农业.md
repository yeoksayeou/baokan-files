    According to today's news report in this newspaper: More than 36,000 workers with certain technical skills in Chongqing have gone to the agricultural front. They are workers who not only have socialist awareness but also possess certain modern technologies. Therefore, as soon as they arrived in the countryside, they plunged into the torrent of the agricultural technical transformation movement and became the technical backbone of the movement. This fact tells us that after industrial and mining enterprises have carried out the technical revolution movement, drawing a portion of technical workers from the saved labor force to support agriculture is a good method and will greatly help accelerate agricultural technical transformation.
    For industry to support agriculture, implement technical transformation, and promote the continued leap forward in agricultural production, it is necessary not only to send production materials such as automobiles, tractors, irrigation and drainage machinery, power generation equipment, building materials, various improved tools and farm implements, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to the countryside, but also to send a certain number of talents who master modern technology to the countryside. Without machines, it is impossible to fundamentally change the backwardness of agricultural technology. With machines, there must be people who are familiar with the machines to operate them so that the machines can fully play their role. Therefore, sending machines to the countryside while sending a portion of technical workers to the countryside to impart technology and train a large number of farmer technical talents who can operate the machines is precisely in line with the urgent needs of the peasant masses and is an indispensable aspect of industry's support for agriculture.
    There are various ways to bring technology to the countryside and impart modern technology to farmers: factory-commune pairing, organizing technical service teams to go to the countryside, sending people from rural people's communes to study in factories and mines, etc., are all effective and warmly welcomed by farmers. However, transferring a portion of technical workers saved from the technical revolution movement to the countryside will be even more welcomed by the people's communes, because they can not only repair existing machinery and equipment and impart the technology they have mastered to the farmers, but also work with the local farmers to carry out a mass movement of farm implement reform based on local natural conditions and the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, starting from the local original technical conditions and adapting to local conditions, to better implement the policy of walking on two legs in agricultural technical transformation.
    This year, the reason why so many industrial and mining enterprises in our country have been able to achieve increased production without increasing the number of people, or even increasing production while reducing the number of people, and have been able to avoid transferring people from the agricultural front to the industrial front, and even transfer a portion of technical workers from the industrial front to support agriculture, is the result of widely carrying out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "four modernizations" on the industrial front, and the result of the universal use of new technologies, new experiences, and new methods in industrial production and construction. Of course, the possibilities of technological progress are unlimited, and the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on the industrial and transportation and basic construction fronts in our country has just begun. Every industrial and mining enterprise must universally achieve increased production without increasing the number of people and increased production while reducing the number of people, and, like Chongqing, properly arrange the saved labor force so that these laborers can play a greater role in supporting agriculture and other newly developed production and construction undertakings.

    抽调一部分技术工人支援农业
    据今天本报消息：重庆市的三万六千多名有一定技术的工人到农业战线上去了。他们都是既有社会主义觉悟，又掌握了一定现代技术的工人，所以一到达农村，便投入农业技术改造运动的洪流，并且成为运动的技术骨干。这个事实告诉我们，工矿企业开展技术革命运动以后，从节约出的劳动力中，抽调一部分技术工人支援农业，是一个好办法，对加速农业技术改造会有很大的帮助。
    工业支援农业实行技术改造，促进农业生产的继续跃进，不仅要给农村送去汽车、拖拉机、排灌机械、发电设备、建筑材料、各种改良工具农具、化学肥料、农药等等生产资料，还要给农村送去一定数量的掌握现代技术的人才。没有机器，不可能从根本上改变农业技术落后的面貌，有了机器还必须有熟悉机器的人去驾驭，机器才能充分发挥作用。所以在送机器下乡的同时，送一部分技术工人到农村去传授技术，培养大批能驾驭机器的农民技术人材，正是合乎农民群众迫切需要的，是工业支援农业的一个不可缺少的方面。
    技术下乡、向农民传授现代技术有各种方式：厂社挂钩，组织技术服务队下乡，农村人民公社派人到工矿里学习等等，都是行之有效，受到农民的热烈欢迎的。但是，抽调一部分从技术革命运动中节省出的技术工人到农村去，更会受到人民公社的欢迎，因为他们不但可以修理现成的机器设备，向农民传授自己所掌握的技术，而且可以和当地农民一道，根据当地自然条件，根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，从当地原有的技术条件出发，因地制宜地开展农具工具改革的群众运动，更好地贯彻执行农业技术改造中的两条腿走路的方针。
    今年，我国许许多多工矿企业所以能够做到增产不增人，甚至增产减人，所以能够做到不从农业战线上调人到工业战线上来，甚至还能从工业战线上抽调一部分技术工人支援农业，这是在工业战线上广泛地开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命群众运动的结果，是在工业生产和建设中，普遍使用新技术、新经验、新方法的结果。当然，技术进步的可能性是无限的，我国工业交通、基本建设战线上的技术革新、技术革命群众运动也还刚刚开始。每一个工矿企业都要普遍做到增产不增人和增产还减人，并且要跟重庆市一样，妥善地安排节约出的劳动力，使这些劳动力在支援农业和其它新发展的生产建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
