Xinhua News Agency, July 4th. Since the beginning of summer, 400,000 members of the Beijing militia and national defense sports enthusiasts have participated in military camping activities, a scale exceeding any previous year.

The personnel participating in this year's military camping are more extensive than in previous years, including young adults from all walks of life such as workers, members of urban and rural people's communes, students, teachers, doctors, nurses, and shop assistants. The forms of activities are also more diverse than in the past, including short camping exercises of a few hours near their units, and the establishment of camping bases in mountainous areas, shooting ranges, national defense clubs, and military schools, conducting "Weekend One-Day" and other camping activities.

On-site camping is a simple and easy-to-implement form, using the spare time from production, study, and work to conduct multiple or single military exercises near the unit. With its short duration and convenience for the broad masses to participate, it has become a new form widely promoted in Beijing's military camping this year. Nearly 100 militiamen from the Hongxing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, who had just returned from learning at the National Defense Sports Club, have become a vital force in the wheat harvest due to their mastery of tractor driving techniques. Chaoyang District recently organized more than 50 units with over 30,000 militiamen to support the suburban farmers in harvesting wheat. They conducted military camping activities on the way, which not only helped them learn military knowledge but also successfully completed the task of supporting the wheat harvest.

During the military camping activities, many units also conducted education on Chairman Mao's military thinking for the militiamen and national defense sports enthusiasts participating in the camping, enabling them to more deeply understand the great significance of "everyone a soldier," recognize the current situation and the nature of imperialism, thereby enhancing their political and ideological awareness, strengthening their national defense concept and sense of responsibility for defending the motherland, and further arousing their determination to oppose American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 4th. The broad masses of militiamen and young students in Shanghai have begun the 1960 annual military summer camp activities.

This year's military summer camp, with the principle of setting up camps locally as the main focus, adopted various activity forms such as short-term, small-scale, and grassroots units running their own camps. The "One-Day Camp" was attended by workers, staff members, neighborhood residents, and other broad masses. The "Five-Day Camp" was for students, and there was also a children's summer camp.

Through the military summer camp activities, the broad masses of militiamen and students throughout the city received a profound national defense education and education on the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army. Students from higher education institutions participating in the "Five-Day Camp" acquired some military knowledge and national defense sports techniques through five days of military study. Militiamen from factories, enterprises, government agencies, and neighborhoods participating in the "One-Day Camp" also initially learned some military knowledge, laying the foundation for future militia training and national defense sports activities. Students participating in the children's summer camp received education on the glorious history and fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army through visits to military units, get-togethers, military games, recreational activities, and storytelling.

    掌握军事知识　增强国防观念
    北京上海民兵和青少年举行军事野营
    新华社4日讯　入夏以来，北京市民兵和国防体育爱好者已有四十万人参加了军事野营活动，规模超过以往任何一年。
    今年参加军事野营的人员比往年广泛，有工人、城乡人民公社社员、学生、师教、医生、护士、售货员等各行各业的青壮年。活动形式也比过去多样，有在本单位附近进行几小时的就近野营，有到山地、靶场、国防俱乐部和军事学校等地设立野营基地，进行“周末一日”等野营活动。
    就近野营是一种简单易行的形式，利用生产、学习、工作的空隙时间，在本单位附近进行多项或单项的军事演习，时间短，便利广大群众参加，成为北京市今年军事野营中广泛推行的一种新的形式。京郊红星人民公社刚刚从国防体育俱乐部学习回来的近百名民兵，在抢收小麦中，由于他们掌握了驾驶拖拉机的技术，成为麦收中的生力军。朝阳区最近组织五十多个单位三万多民兵去支援郊区农民麦收，途中进行了军事野营活动，既学习了军事知识，又很好地完成了支援麦收任务。
    在军事野营活动中，许多单位还向参加野营的民兵和国防体育爱好者，进行了毛主席的军事思想教育，使他们更深刻地了解全民皆兵的伟大意义，认清了当前形势和帝国主义的本质，从而提高自己的政治思想觉悟，增强国防观念和保卫祖国的责任感，更加激起他们反对美帝侵略，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平的决心。
    新华社上海4日电　上海市广大民兵和青少年学生，开始了1960年度的军事夏令营活动。
    今年军事夏令营，各单位在以就地设营为主的方针下，采取了短期、小型和基层单位自办等多种多样活动形式，有工人、职员和里弄居民等广大群众参加的“一日营”，学生“五日营”和少年夏令营。
    全市广大民兵和学生，通过军事夏令营活动，受到一次深刻的国防教育和人民解放军的优良传统教育。参加学生“五日营”的高等院校学生，通过五天的军事学习，掌握一些军事知识和国防体育运动的技术。参加“一日营”的工厂、企业、机关和里弄的民兵，也初步学到一些军事知识，为今后的民兵训练和国防体育活动打下基础。参加少年夏令营的学生，通过到部队参观、联欢，作军事游戏、文体活动和讲故事等形式，接受人民解放军的光荣历史和优良传统教育。（附图片）
