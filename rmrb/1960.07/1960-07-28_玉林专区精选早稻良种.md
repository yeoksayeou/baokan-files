Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Yulin Special District in Guangxi is taking advantage of the harvest season to carefully select early-maturing, high-yielding rice strains in preparation for promoting three crops a year next year.

The Yulin Special District has summarized its past experience in seed selection, especially the experience of Bobai County in implementing three crops a year, to guide the masses in unifying the high yield and early maturity of varieties to the greatest extent possible during seed selection. As of the 13th, the entire special district had carefully selected more than 25.8 million jin of fine early rice strains.

The Yulin Special District is located in southern Guangxi and has a subtropical climate with abundant rainfall and high temperatures, making it very favorable for implementing three crops a year. According to the experience of Bobai County, promoting early-maturing, high-yielding fine strains is one of the important conditions for realizing a bumper harvest of three crops a year.
