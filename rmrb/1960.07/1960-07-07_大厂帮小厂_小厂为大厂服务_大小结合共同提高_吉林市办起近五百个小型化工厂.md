Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 6th—The famous chemical industrial city of Jilin is launching a mass movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry, led by large state-owned enterprises driving local small enterprises. In the past five months, the city's urban and rural people's communes have built 496 new small chemical factories, initially forming a chemical industrial network with large enterprises like the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company as the backbone, interspersed with small "foreign groups" and "native groups" enterprises, enabling the local chemical industry to advance by leaps and bounds at an unprecedented speed. Currently, the chemical products produced by the urban and rural people's communes' chemical industry have reached more than 400 varieties.

The mass movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry in Jilin City is being carried out under the unified leadership of the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, following the principles of big factories helping small factories, small factories serving big factories, combining large and small, cooperating with each other, and developing together. In recent years, the state-owned chemical industrial enterprises in this city, with the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company as the main force, have developed rapidly, and the need for raw materials has grown rapidly, urgently requiring the development of local resources and the establishment of raw material bases locally. In addition, the company and other chemical and light industrial enterprises in the city discharge tons of waste gas, waste liquid, waste residue, and waste materials every day. These discarded resources can be used to establish a large number of small chemical factories mainly for comprehensive utilization. The development of local industrial and agricultural production has also increased the demand for various chemical products. Based on the above situation, at the beginning of this year, the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made the decision to "everyone learn chemicals, everyone run chemicals, chemicals everywhere," widely mobilizing the enthusiasm of urban and rural people's communes, relying on the superior technical conditions of large enterprises, developing the rich local resources, and vigorously developing small chemical industries mainly producing raw materials and mainly for comprehensive utilization, on the one hand supporting the development of state-owned chemical industrial enterprises, and on the other hand meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

Vigorously developing local resources and developing the chemical raw material industry is one of the main directions of the Jilin City's mass movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry. These widely distributed small chemical raw material industries will gradually lay the foundation for the development of the local chemical industry on the one hand, and on the other hand, will open up broad sources of raw materials for large enterprises, enabling large enterprises to establish raw material bases locally. Since the beginning of this year, the three major chemical plants of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company have obtained nearly 100 kinds of raw materials from small chemical factories in urban and rural people's communes. The ferrous sulfate used by the carbide plant of this company to produce acetic acid is basically supplied by small chemical factories in the city. The raw materials such as copper acetate, copper citrate, and sodium nitrate used by the dye plant are all produced by people's commune chemical factories; in addition, these large factories also obtain raw materials such as sodium sulfide, mirabilite, and sulfuric acid from various small chemical factories. Thanks to the support of local small chemical factories, this factory has overcome the difficulties caused by the doubling of production and has completed half of the annual state plan sixteen days ahead of schedule on June 15.

Using the waste materials from large factories to carry out comprehensive utilization and produce a wide variety of chemical products to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives in many ways is another main direction of the Jilin City's mass movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry. At present, among the chemical industries run by urban people's communes, in addition to some comprehensive chemical factories producing a variety of products, there are also factories producing plastic products, rubber products, medicines, veterinary drugs, as well as daily chemical products such as soap, toothpaste, and shampoo powder, among which chemical factories mainly utilizing waste materials account for the vast majority of small chemical enterprises in the city. At present, these factories produce more than a thousand tons of chemical products from waste materials every month.

Developing the chemical fertilizer industry and the agricultural and veterinary drug industry to support the technical transformation of agriculture is the third main direction of the Jilin City's mass movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry. At present, some medium and small-sized synthetic ammonia plants, ammonium sulfate, and phosphate fertilizer workshops have been established and are being established as the backbone. In addition, rural people's communes have established 230 year-round and seasonal chemical fertilizer and pesticide factories, producing bacterial fertilizer, peat fertilizer, veterinary oxytetracycline, 666 powder, etc., achieving that every commune has a chemical factory.

In the vigorous development of the chemical industry, large enterprises such as the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, Jilin Provincial Paper Mill, and New China Sugar Refinery have sent technicians and workers to help urban people's communes and rural people's communes in the five counties of Yongji, Jiaohe, Panshi, Shulan, and Huadian under the jurisdiction of the city to set up factories and carry out production on the spot in places with abundant resources or convenient sources of raw materials. Urban and rural people's communes have carried forward the spirit of starting from scratch, self-reliance, and running factories diligently and thriftily, and many experts in starting from scratch have emerged.

### 大厂帮小厂　小厂为大厂服务　大小结合共同提高  吉林市办起近五百个小型化工厂

    大厂帮小厂　小厂为大厂服务　大小结合共同提高
    吉林市办起近五百个小型化工厂
    新华社吉林6日电　著名的化学工业城市——吉林市正在开展一个以国家大企业带动地方小企业为主的大办化工的群众运动。最近五个月来，全市城乡人民公社新建小型化工厂有四百九十六个，初步形成了一个以吉林化学工业公司等大洋群企业为骨干、小洋群和小土群企业星罗棋布的化学工业网，使地方化学工业以空前的速度突飞猛进。目前城乡人民公社化学工业生产的化学产品，品种已达四百多种。
    吉林市大办化工的群众运动，是在中共吉林市委的统一领导下，按照大厂帮小厂、小厂为大厂服务、大小结合、互相协作、共同发展的原则开展起来的。近年来，这个城市以吉林化学工业公司为主的国家化学工业企业发展速度很快，原材料的需要量迅速增长，迫切要求开发当地资源，在当地建立原材料基地。另外，这个公司及全市其它化工、轻工企业每天排除数以千吨计的废气、废液、废渣、废料。这些废弃资源可以用来大量兴办以综合利用为主的小型化工厂。当地工农业生产的发展，对各种化工产品的需要量也日益增加。根据上述情况，今年年初，中共吉林市委作出了“全民学化工，全民办化工，遍地是化工”的决定，广泛调动城乡人民公社的积极性，依靠大企业的优越技术条件，开发本地的丰富资源，大办起生产原材料为主和以综合利用为主的小型化学工业，一方面支援国家化学工业企业的发展，另一方面满足工农业生产和人民生活的需要。
    大力开发当地资源、发展化工原料工业，是吉林市大办化工运动的主要方向之一。这些分布广泛的小型化工原料工业，一方面将为地方化学工业的发展逐步奠定基础，另一方面也给大企业开辟了广阔的原料来源，使大企业在当地建立了原料基地。今年以来，吉林化学工业公司三大化工厂已从城乡人民公社小型化工厂获得近百种原材料。这个公司的电石厂生产醋酸用的硫酸亚铁基本上是本市小型化工厂供应的。染料厂用的醋酸铜、石酸铜、硝酸钠等原料，全部是人民公社化工厂生产的；此外，这些大厂还从各小型化工厂取得硫化碱、芒硝、硫酸等原料。这个厂由于得到当地小型化工厂的支援，克服了由于生产翻番带来的原材料不足的困难，已经在6月15日提前十六天完成了全年国家计划的一半。
    利用大厂废物大搞综合利用，生产品种繁多的化工产品，多方面满足工农业生产和人民生活需要，是吉林市大办化工运动的另一个主要方向。目前，城区人民公社兴办的化学工业中，除了部分生产多种产品的综合性化工厂之外，还有生产塑料制品、橡胶制品、医药、兽药以及肥皂、牙膏、洗头粉等日用化工产品的工厂，其中以综合利用废物为主的化工厂，占全市小型化工企业的绝大部分。现在这些工厂每月利用废物生产的化工产品已达千吨以上。
    发展化学肥料工业和农、兽药工业，支援农业的技术改造，是吉林市大办化工运动的第三个主要方向。目前全市已经建立和正在建立一些中小型的合成氨厂、硫铵和磷肥车间，作为骨干。此外，农村人民公社建立了常年生产和季节生产的化肥厂、农药厂二百三十个，生产菌肥、草炭肥、兽用土霉素、六六六粉等，实现了社社有化工厂。
    在大办化学工业中，吉林化学工业公司，吉林省造纸厂、新中国制糖厂等大企业，都派出了技术人员和工人，帮助城市人民公社和市属永吉、蛟河、磐石、舒兰、桦甸五个县的农村人民公社，在资源丰富或原料来源方便的地方就地设厂和进行生产。城乡各人民公社发扬了白手起家、自力更生、勤俭办厂的精神，涌现出许多白手起家的能手。（附图片）
