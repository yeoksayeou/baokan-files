Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: With the deepening development of the mass literary creation movement, a mass movement of writing literary reviews has emerged on Shanghai's literary and art front this year. Many factories, shops, schools, and neighborhood organizations have established literary review groups. Thousands of people have started writing reviews. A new type of working-class literary review team is taking shape.

Since the mass literary criticism has been carried out, an unprecedentedly prosperous new situation has emerged in the entire literary criticism field. The scope of reviews involves poetry, novels, essays, factory histories, drama, movies, music, fine arts, and other aspects. From factory newspapers and blackboard newspapers to municipal-level newspapers and periodicals, a large number of literary reviews written by workers have been published. In June, 32 theater reviews were published in Shanghai newspapers and periodicals, 15 of which were written by workers. Many grassroots units and municipal and district organizations also held large-scale literary review competitions.

The extensive development of the mass literary review movement in Shanghai is an inevitable result of the great development of mass literary creation. Since the Great Leap Forward, mass creation has been unprecedentedly prosperous. This year, from the city and districts to the grassroots, the "poetry competition," "song competition," "painting competition," "story competition," and "essay competition" styles have been very popular. A large number of works need to be reviewed and analyzed, mass creation activities need guidance and improvement, and rich creative experience needs to be theoretically summarized. This requires literary review work to keep up closely, and if only a small number of professional literary review writers are relied upon, it will be impossible to fully undertake this task. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses continued to break the superstition that "it is okay to engage in creation, but writing reviews cannot be done," and the movement of writing literary reviews on a large scale was launched throughout the city. Many factories with relatively good mass literary creation movements have established "review groups," with approximately more than 200 literary review groups in the city.

The vigorous development of the mass literary review movement in Shanghai is also the result of the city's widespread study of Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses not only study Chairman Mao's works but also talk, write, and use theory extensively to make theory serve actual struggle. Many factory literary review groups study Chairman Mao's works on literary theory to arm themselves with Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, while simultaneously conducting review activities. Therefore, the most prominent feature of mass literary review is the analysis of literary and artistic works from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, with a clear stand and strong combat effectiveness. In their reviews, the masses enthusiastically recommend good works with socialist and communist ideology and severely criticize unhealthy works or even bad works that promote bourgeois ideology, in accordance with the principle of "political criteria first, artistic criteria second," to achieve the goal of cultivating fragrant flowers and removing poisonous weeds.

Mass literary review directly serves the mass literary creation movement, and it plays a huge role in promoting the great popularization and great improvement of creation. In grassroots organizations such as factories and shops, the object of review is primarily literary works created by the unit. Through reviews, the advantages and disadvantages of the works in terms of content and form are pointed out, the author is helped to correct literary and artistic thought, and the work is improved artistically to achieve a better level. The literary review group of the China Shipbuilding Factory often holds discussion meetings in park tea rooms on rest days. Sometimes, they select works by a certain amateur author over a period of time for comprehensive review, analyzing their creative tendencies and pointing out the direction of their efforts; sometimes, they select works created by workers in the factory, dividing them into three categories: better, needing modification, and containing errors, and review them separately to help the authors improve. Some literary review groups also analyze and study the common problems in the current mass literary creation, exploring the laws of artistic expression based on the laws of life, such as the development of contradictory conflicts in works reflecting the Great Leap Forward, the establishment of the main opposing side, the image shaping of Party leadership, and some ideological issues in mass literary creation, which have been the content of their research.

Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai attach great importance to cultivating a working-class literary review team, listing this work as one of the contents of the cultural revolution and the great popularization and improvement of literature and art. Some district party committee first secretaries personally grasp this work, and many factory party committee secretaries also participate in the literary review groups and personally write literary reviews. Responsible cadres of the party committee also give reports to the masses, explaining Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought or current situation issues, so that mass literary review activities develop healthily in the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause.

    上海广大群众积极写文艺评论
    对群众文艺创作的普及和提高起了巨大促进作用
    据新华社上海27日电　随着群众文艺创作运动的深入发展，今年以来，上海文艺战线上出现了一个群众性的大写文艺评论的运动。许多工厂、商店、学校、里弄组织都成立了文艺评论小组。动笔写评论的人数以千计。一支新型的工人阶级的文艺评论队伍正在形成。
    群众性文艺评论开展起来以后，整个文艺评论园地出现了空前繁荣的新局面。评论的范围涉及到诗歌、小说、散文、工厂史、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术等各个方面。从工厂的厂报、黑板报到市一级的报纸、刊物，都大量地发表了工人们创作的文艺评论。6月份上海各报和刊物上发表了三十二篇剧评，其中有十五篇便是工人群众写的。许多基层单位和市、区机构，还举行规模盛大的文艺评论比赛会。
    上海群众性文艺评论运动的广泛开展，是群众文艺创作大发展的必然结果。大跃进以来群众创作空前繁荣，今年从市、区到基层，“赛诗”、“赛歌”、“赛画”、“赛故事”、“赛论文”之风大盛，大量作品需要评介和分析，群众创作活动需要辅导和提高，丰富的创作经验需要从理论上加以总结。这就要求文艺评论工作紧紧跟上去，而如果只是依靠少数专业的文艺评论作者，是不可能完全担负这一任务的。于是广大群众在党的领导下，继续打破认为“搞搞创作还可以，要写评论干不了”的迷信，大写文艺评论的运动便在全市范围内展开。许多群众文艺创作运动开展得比较好的工厂都建立了“评论组”，全市的文艺评论小组约在二百个以上。
    上海群众性文艺评论运动的蓬勃开展，也是全市群众广泛学习毛主席著作的结果。广大群众不但大学毛主席著作，而且大讲、大写、大用理论，使理论为实际斗争服务。许多工厂的文艺评论小组，一边学习毛主席关于文艺理论的著作，以毛泽东文艺思想武装自己，一边展开评论活动。因此，群众文艺评论最显著的一个特点，便是以马列主义的观点来分析文艺作品，立场鲜明，战斗性强烈。群众在自己的评论中，根据“政治标准第一，艺术标准第二”的原则，满腔热情地推荐具有社会主义、共产主义思想的好作品，严厉批判内容不健康的以至宣扬资产阶级思想的坏作品，以达到培育香花、锄掉毒草的目的。
    群众文艺评论是直接为群众文艺创作运动服务的，它对创作的大普及大提高，起着巨大的促进作用。在工厂、商店等基层组织内，评论的对象，首先是本单位创作的文艺作品。通过评论，指出作品在内容和形式上的优缺点，帮助作者端正文艺思想，并且在艺术上提高，使作品达到更好的水平。中华造船厂的文艺评论小组，每逢休息日，经常在公园茶厅举行讨论会，有时选择某一业余作者一定时期内的作品，加以综合性的评论，分析其创作倾向，指出努力的方向；有时选择本厂工人创作的作品，分为较好的、需要修改的、内容有错误的三类，分别加以评论，帮助作者提高。有的文艺评论小组，还针对当前群众文艺创作中带有普遍性的问题，进行分析和研究，从生活的规律出发，探讨艺术表现的规律，如关于反映大跃进的作品中矛盾冲突的开展的问题，主要对立面的树立问题，党的领导的形象塑造问题，以及群众文艺创作中的一些思想问题，都曾经是他们研究的内容。
    上海各级党的组织，都十分重视培养工人阶级的文艺评论队伍，把这项工作列为文化革命和文艺大普及、大提高的内容之一。有的区委第一书记亲自抓这项工作，许多工厂的党委书记，也参加文艺评论小组，亲自动手写文艺评论。党委的负责干部还为群众作报告，讲解毛泽东文艺思想或当前形势问题，使群众性的文艺评论活动沿着为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向健康发展。
