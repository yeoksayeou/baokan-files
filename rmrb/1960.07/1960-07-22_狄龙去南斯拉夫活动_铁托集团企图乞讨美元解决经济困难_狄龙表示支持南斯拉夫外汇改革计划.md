Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 21st: U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon visited Yugoslavia from the 17th to the 20th.

It is reported that Tito received Dillon during his visit. Dillon held talks with Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Todorovic on "economic relations between the two countries." According to sources close to Yugoslav officials, Yugoslavia's invitation to Dillon this time has almost the same purpose as the recent invitation to Jacobson, the president of the International Monetary Fund controlled by U.S. monopoly capital, namely, to beg for U.S. dollars to solve Yugoslavia's economic difficulties and implement a measure to reform the foreign exchange system. The "New York Times" said that the result of implementing this reform would be to allow Yugoslavia to "enter the collective of Western free market countries."

On the 20th, Dillon confirmed the above statement at a press conference held in Zagreb. He said that the United States has been watching Yugoslavia's efforts to solve many difficult problems, especially economic problems, with "sympathy" in the past few years. The United States is satisfied with this form of "cooperation" in providing "loans" to Yugoslavia. Dillon praised Yugoslavia for "making good use of" this form of "assistance." He pointed out that in this meeting with Yugoslav leaders, both sides agreed "to strengthen trade and other economic relations between the two countries," and emphasized that this "economic cooperation will continue." He also said that during his visit, they discussed Yugoslavia's plan to reform foreign exchange, in which Yugoslavia "will receive U.S. support."

    狄龙去南斯拉夫活动
    铁托集团企图乞讨美元解决经济困难
    狄龙表示支持南斯拉夫外汇改革计划
    新华社21日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：美国副国务卿狄龙在17日到20日访问了南斯拉夫。
    据报道，在狄龙访问期间，铁托接见了他。狄龙同南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席托多罗维奇就
  “两国间的经济关系”举行了会谈。据接近南斯拉夫官方的人士透露，南斯拉夫这次邀请狄龙访问，同不久前邀请由美国垄断资本控制的国际货币基金组织的总裁雅各布森对南斯拉夫的访问几乎具有同样的目的，即向美国乞讨美元，以解救南斯拉夫经济困境和实现一项改革外汇制度的措施。“纽约时报”说，实现这一改革的结果，就将使南斯拉夫“进入西方自由市场国家的集体”。
    20日，狄龙在萨格布举行的记者招待会上证实了以上的说法。他说，美国在过去几年中以“同情的态度”注视着南斯拉夫解决许多困难问题，特别是解决经济问题时的努力。美国对向南斯拉夫提供“贷款”这种形式的“合作”感到满意。狄龙赞扬南斯拉夫“很好地利用了”这种形式的“援助”。他指出，在这次同南斯拉夫领导人的会谈中，双方一致认为“要加强两国间的贸易和其他经济关系”，并强调，这种“经济合作将继续下去”。他还说，在他访问期间，曾谈到了南斯拉夫将改革外汇的计划，在这方面，南斯拉夫“将得到美国的支持”。
