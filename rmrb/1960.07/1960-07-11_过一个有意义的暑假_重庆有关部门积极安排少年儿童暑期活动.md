Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 10th. The Propaganda Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau, and the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League are actively arranging and planning pleasant and meaningful summer activities for the city's children.

This year, the summer life of children throughout the city will mainly rely on the "Children's Home" as a base for organization and development. In order to strengthen the leadership of the "Children's Home," each commune, factory, and mine will establish an extracurricular education committee for children and will select a large number of outstanding Party members, Youth League members, educators, and active elements among the masses to serve as instructors for the "Children's Home." Currently, more than 6,000 "Children's Homes" have been organized in factories, mines, schools, rural people's communes, and government agencies throughout the city.

The summer activities for children in Chongqing this year will be even richer and more colorful than in previous years. In addition to organizing various relaxed and enjoyable recreational and sports activities in schools, the city will also vigorously promote mass scientific and technological research activities for children. There will be planned organizations for children to visit the achievements of socialist construction, visit factories and communes, and participate in some labor within their capacity, to cultivate children's excellent character of serving the people.

During the summer vacation, the city will also widely carry out the "Long Live Chairman Mao" reading campaign, organizing children to widely read stories and books about Chairman Mao's leadership in revolutionary struggles and construction.

To help children choose reading materials and solve the difficulty of insufficient children's books and periodicals, Lianglukou Elementary School in Chongqing mobilized all the students and social forces to cut out communications, features, and stories published in newspapers and periodicals, compile them into books. In four days, they received support from more than 300 adults in 64 units, collected nearly 2,000 copies of materials from 21 kinds of newspapers and periodicals, and more than 1,000 stories about Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of teachers, they produced 827 books (including readers, comic strips, picture albums, and poetry collections). Currently, this creative activity is being promoted among children throughout the city.

　　过一个有意义的暑假
　　重庆有关部门积极安排少年儿童暑期活动
    新华社重庆10日电　中共重庆市委宣传部，重庆市教育局，共青团重庆市委员会，积极为全市少年儿童安排和布置了愉快而有意义的暑期活动。
    今年全市少年儿童的暑期生活将主要依靠“少年之家”为基地进行组织和开展。为了加强对“少年之家”的领导，各公社、厂矿都将成立儿童校外教育委员会，并且将选派大批的优秀党、团员、教育工作者和群众中的积极分子担任“少年之家”的辅导员。目前，全市各厂矿、学校、城乡人民公社、机关等已经组织了“少年之家”六千多个。
    重庆市少年儿童今年的暑期活动，将比往年更加丰富多彩。各校除将组织各种轻松愉快的文娱体育活动外，全市还将大力开展少年儿童群众性的科学技术研究活动。有计划的组织儿童参观社会主义建设成就，访问工厂、公社和参加一些力所能及的劳动等，以培养儿童为人民服务的优良品德。
    在暑假生活中，全市还将广泛开展“毛主席万万岁”的读书活动，组织少年儿童广泛阅读有关毛主席领导革命斗争和领导建设的故事书籍。
    为了帮助儿童选择读物和解决儿童书刊不足的困难，重庆市两路口小学发动全校少年儿童和社会力量，把报刊上登载过的通讯、特写、故事剪辑下来，编制成书，四天中，他们得到了六十四个单位三百多个成年人的支持，收集到二十一种报刊上的资料近两千份，有关毛主席的故事一千多篇，在教师指导下制成了八百二十七本图书（包括读本、连环画、画集、诗歌集）。目前，这一富有创造性的活动正在全市少年儿童中推广。
