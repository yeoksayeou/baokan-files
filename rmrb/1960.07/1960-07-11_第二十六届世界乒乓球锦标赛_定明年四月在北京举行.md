The decision to hold the 26th World Table Tennis Championships in Beijing was approved at the International Table Tennis Federation Congress held in Dortmund last April.

The Chinese Table Tennis Association has formed the Organizing Committee for the 26th World Table Tennis Championships, with Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, as Chairman, and Chen Xian, Chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, and Zhang Lianhua, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, as Vice Chairmen. At the International Table Tennis Federation Advisory Committee meeting held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, this April, Chen Xian, Chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, on behalf of the Organizing Committee for the championships, reported on the preparations. Leaders of the International Table Tennis Federation and representatives from various countries attending the meeting expressed satisfaction with the preparations.

To ensure the smooth progress of the championships, a gymnasium capable of accommodating 15,000 spectators is currently being built next to the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The new gymnasium is circular, and the competition venue can accommodate ten matches simultaneously. The "Red Double Happiness" brand of table tennis balls produced in China has been approved as the international competition ball at the International Table Tennis Federation Advisory Committee meeting held in Zagreb and is now officially designated as the official ball for the next World Table Tennis Championships. In June, the Organizing Committee sent two dozen samples to each member association of the International Table Tennis Federation (a total of seventy-nine, including China).

　　第二十六届世界乒乓球锦标赛
　　定明年四月在北京举行
    新华社10日讯　据第二十六届世界乒乓球锦标赛组织委员会（中华人民共和国乒乓球协会）消息，这次锦标赛已经确定于1961年4月5日至14日在北京举行。有关这次锦标赛的准备工作正积极进行中。
    关于在北京举行第二十六届世界乒乓球锦标赛的决定，是去年4月在多特蒙德举行的国际乒乓球联合会代表大会上通过的。
    中国乒乓球协会已经组成了第二十六届世界乒乓球锦标赛组织委员会，由中华全国体育总会副主席荣高棠任主席，中国乒乓球协会主席陈先和中华全国体育总会秘书长张联华任副主席。今年4月间在南斯拉夫萨格勒布举行的国际乒乓球联合会咨询委员会会议上，中国乒乓球协会主席陈先代表这次锦标赛的组织委员会，报告了有关筹备工作的情况。国际乒乓球联合会领导人和与会的各国代表，对各项筹备工作表示满意。
    为使锦标赛得以顺利进行，目前正在北京工人体育场旁边兴建一座能容纳一万五千名观众的体育馆。这个新体育馆呈圆形，比赛场地能够同时进行十场比赛。我国生产的“红双?”牌乒乓球，已经在萨格勒布举行的国际乒乓球联合会咨询委员会上，被批准为国际比赛用球，现在正式确定为下届世界乒乓球锦标赛用球。今年6月间，组织委员会已向每一个国际乒乓球联合会的会员协会（连中国共七十九个），寄出了两打样品。
