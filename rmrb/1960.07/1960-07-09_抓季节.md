    Seize the Season
    Agricultural production deals directly with nature, so special attention must be paid to seizing the season. Whether the season, especially the critical season, is seized well often determines the success or failure of a season's or a year's production. Spring plowing and summer weeding, without violating the farming season, are the basic requirements for seizing the season; fully utilizing the farming season, tapping potential, doing more things, and doing them well, are the more active requirements for seizing the season.
    The season is determined by various natural conditions. People cannot decide the earliness or lateness of the season, nor can they plant whatever they want whenever they want. However, people can master the laws of nature, seize the opportunity, take the initiative, maximize the use of all the time in each season, and create as much production as possible.
    From now until the autumn harvest, these three months or so are a crucial season for agricultural production. There is still much to be done, whether to strive for planting more and harvesting more, or to strive for high yield and more harvest. First of all, we can maximize the expansion of the summer sowing area. In the first half of this year, most parts of North China lacked rain, and some farmland was not planted due to drought, and some farmland had uneven emergence due to drought. Under such circumstances, it is even more important to expand the planting area by taking advantage of the summer sowing season. All farmland that can be summer-sown should be used during this period to plant crops. Areas with good conditions should try to plant high-yield crops; areas with poor conditions, such as areas with short frost-free periods, should try to plant early-maturing crops and late-autumn crops. Farmland that can grow grain crops should try to grow grain crops. If it is not possible to grow grain, it is also good to grow more minor oil crops, feed, and vegetables. In short, in terms of planting, we should give full play to subjective efforts, try every means to use all the possibilities provided by the season to achieve the goal of planting more. The same is true for field management. Now that the rainy season has arrived, weeds are growing rapidly, and field management must keep up to create favorable conditions for the growth and development of crops; otherwise, it will increase the number of third-class seedlings and make later management more difficult. We must seize this season firmly, do everything possible to plant more and plant well, and manage carefully.
    All localities should generally seize this crucial season. Of course, due to different local conditions, the things to be done are also different. Some areas are heavily affected by drought and need to continue to fight drought and rush to plant, or take advantage of the rain to rush to plant; some areas have experienced repeated heavy rains and need to vigorously drain water and protect seedlings, and strive to reduce losses or even recover what was lost due to disasters; in some areas, the prominent task is to concentrate forces to carry out shock summer hoeing and eliminate weeds; in some areas, summer sowing and field management need to be carried out simultaneously. In short, each region should seize the current critical season and strive to solve the critical problems in production.
    Just as fighting a war requires concentrating superior forces, in production, if we want to seize the key season, we must also concentrate superior forces, mobilize the masses, and go all out. Cadres at all levels meeting in the fields, and leading cadres going deep into the front line of production, this is the concentration of leadership, and it is also a basic guarantee for winning battles in the key season. With the concentration of leadership and the strengthening of leadership, it is easier to mobilize strong manpower and material resources to invest in the current main attack of production. Many regions have already done this, and all regions should do this.

    抓季节
    农业生产直接跟自然打交道，要特别讲究抓季节。季节，特别是关键性的季节抓得好不好，常常关系一季或一年生产的成败。春耕夏耘，不违农时，这是抓季节的起码要求；充分利用农时，挖掘潜力，做更多的事情，并且都做好了，这是抓季节的更积极的要求。
    季节是各种自然条件决定的。人们不能决定季节的早迟，不能想在什么时候种什么就种什么。但是，人们可以掌握自然规律，可以抓紧时机，争取主动，最大限度地利用每个季节的所有的时间，尽可能创造更大的生产成果。
    从现在到秋收，这三个月左右的时间，正是农业生产上的关键性季节，不论争取多种多收，还是争取高产多收，都还大有可为。首先，可以最大限度地扩大夏播面积，今年上半年，华北大部地区缺雨，有些农田因为受旱没有种上，有些农田因为受旱出苗不齐。在这种情况下，利用夏播季节，扩大种植面积就更加重要了。凡是可以夏播的农田，都应当利用目前这段时间，把庄稼种上。条件好的地区，要尽量多种高产作物；条件差的地区，例如无霜期短的地区，要尽量种上早熟作物和晚秋作物。能种粮食作物的农田，应当尽量种上粮食。不能种粮食的，多种些小油料、饲料、蔬菜也是好的。总之，在种的方面，应当高度发挥主观努力，想尽一切办法，利用季节提供给我们的一切可能性，实现多种的目的。在田间管理方面也是一样。现在雨季已到，草苗争长，田间管理要紧紧跟上，为庄稼的生长发育创造有利的条件；否则就会增加三类苗，给后期管理增加困难。我们一定要狠狠抓住这个季节，尽一切可能，多种种好，精心管好。
    对于这个关键性季节，各地应当普遍抓紧。当然，由于各地情况不同，要作的事也不一样。有的地区受旱较重，需要继续抗旱抢种或趁雨抢种；有的地区屡降暴雨，要大力排涝保苗，力争减少损失以至夺回因灾损失的东西；有的地区突出的任务是集中力量突击夏锄，消灭草荒；有的地区夏播和田间管理需要双管齐下。总之，每个地区都应该抓住目前这个关键性季节，努力解决生产上的关键性问题。
    像打仗必需集中优势兵力一样，在生产上，要想抓住关键季节，同样必需集中优势力量，兴师动众，全力以赴。几级干部会师田间，领导干部深入生产第一线，这是领导力量的集中，也是在关键季节打胜仗的基本保证。领导力量集中了，领导加强了，就便于调动强大人力、物力投入当前生产的主攻方面。不少地区已经这样做了，一切地区都应当这样做。
