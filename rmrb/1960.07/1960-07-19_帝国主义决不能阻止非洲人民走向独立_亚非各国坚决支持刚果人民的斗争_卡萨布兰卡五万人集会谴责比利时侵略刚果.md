Xinhua News Agency, July 17th - The broad masses of people and governments of some countries in Asia and Africa have expressed their support for the just struggle of the Congolese people to defend their independence and oppose imperialist armed intervention.

The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement on the 16th, announcing its support for the Congolese government and demanding that all Asian and African countries support the Republic of the Congo in every possible way.

The statement condemned the appearance of Belgian troops in the Congo as blatant and barbaric colonialist aggression. The statement demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Belgian invading forces. Regarding the issue of the United Nations sending troops to the Congo, the statement said that the sole responsibility of such a security force is to force Belgian troops to withdraw from the Congo.

The Secretariat called on the people of Asia, Africa, and the entire world to mobilize their resources and strength to support the Congo. The statement concluded by saying that the just struggle of the Congolese people and government to safeguard sovereignty and national unity will be victorious.

According to an announcement on the 17th by the representative of the Provisional Government of Algeria in Cairo, Algerian Prime Minister Abbas has sent a telegram to the President and Prime Minister of the Congo, expressing the indignation of the Algerian government, the National Liberation Army, and the people at the imperialist aggression against the Congo, and expressing support for the position of the Congolese government.

The Guinean government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Belgian government. According to a broadcast by Guinean radio on the 16th, President Sékou Touré also sent a telegram to Moise Tshombe, the governor of Katanga Province, who, at the behest of imperialism, attempted to split Katanga Province from the Congo, pointing out that the establishment of a "republic" in Katanga Province runs counter to the will of the Congolese people and the people of all African countries, and this will arouse universal indignation among all African people.

The National Union of the United Arab Republic passed a resolution on the 16th, announcing its support for the struggle of the Congolese people and calling on the people of Asia and Africa to aid them. In his speech at the closing ceremony of the meeting, UAR President Nasser stated that the UAR is "prepared to help the Congo defend its own independence."

Sudanese Acting Foreign Minister Hassan Bashir has sent a telegram to the President of the Congo, stating that Sudan is ready to provide assistance to the Congo in maintaining its independence. According to a report from Khartoum on the 15th by the Middle East News Agency, the Sudanese Acting Foreign Minister announced that a Sudanese delegation headed by Mahjoub Barmikawe, Assistant Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, will go to the Congo to determine what kind of assistance Sudan needs to provide.

Libyan Prime Minister Kabar issued a statement condemning Belgian armed intervention in the Congo and announced that Libya prohibits Belgian aircraft transporting troops or military equipment from using Libyan airports or flying over Libyan airspace.

The Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee issued a statement in New Delhi on the 16th, condemning the Belgian government for directly interfering in the Congo with the support of other imperialist countries, and expressing support for the Congolese government and people's "heroic struggle to defend their newly acquired freedom and national integrity." The statement demanded the immediate withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo and said that "no matter what actions any imperialism takes, it cannot now stop the African people from moving towards freedom."

The "Myanmar New Light of Burma" published an editorial on the 16th saying, "Africa is the last foothold of imperialism, so imperialism is certainly stubbornly unwilling to let go, but in the current world situation, imperialism must collapse. Therefore, it is Belgium that will inevitably fail on the Congo issue." An editorial in the "People's Daily" of Mandalay, Myanmar, on the 16th, after reviewing the Congolese people's struggle against colonialism and for national independence, pointed out, "The Americans are the most enthusiastic about playing tricks in the newly independent countries of Africa. They are spreading their nets, preparing to seize these countries once they get rid of the control of the British, French, and Belgians."

Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, July 17th - More than 50,000 people in Casablanca, Morocco's largest city, held a rally at the stadium on the afternoon of the 17th to support the heroic struggle of the Congolese people against foreign aggression.
