    "Shooting the Arrow at the Target"
    ——Some Words on the Experience of Shashi and Luotian in Studying Mao Zedong Thought,
    and in Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of the Founding of "Qi Yi" Magazine
    Gong Tongwen
    Many articles in this issue of "Qi Yi" magazine introduce the experiences of Shashi and Luotian in studying Mao Zedong Thought. I think we can summarize their experiences in these four words: "Shooting the arrow at the target."
    What does "shooting the arrow at the target" mean?
    Comrade Mao Zedong said:
    "How should Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution be linked? To put it in simple terms, it is 'shooting the arrow at the target'. The 'arrow' is the arrow, the 'target' is the target, and the arrow must be aimed at the target."
            (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 821)
    There is no better arrow than Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the model for combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and it is a new development of Marxism-Leninism in the new historical period. The practice of revolution and construction proves that Mao Zedong Thought has practical significance for the Chinese revolution, the Eastern revolution, and the world revolution. Studying Mao Zedong Thought, publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, and acting in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought is the only way for us to go from victory to victory. The party organizations in Shashi and Luotian have launched a mass movement to study Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of workers and peasants. Their method is to learn what they do, learn while doing, integrate learning with application, and twist revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice into one rope. They treat Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" and the practical problems in thought, production, and life as the "target," and shoot the "arrow" at the "target," achieving "three gains with one arrow," and reaping an all-round harvest in thought, production, and life. This method is the "shooting the arrow at the target" and "seeking truth from facts" method advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. This method has nothing in common with the methods of those doctrinaire people who are "top-heavy, shallow-rooted, sharp-tongued, thick-skinned, and empty-bellied"; and it is even more different from the methods of those modern revisionists who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and peddle bourgeois goods.
    Comrade Mao Zedong warned those who "shoot the arrow without a target" a long time ago, and also warned those who "just hold the arrow in their hands and rub it, praising 'Good arrow! Good arrow!' but are always unwilling to let it go." He said, "The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot the target of the Chinese revolution. If this problem is not made clear, the theoretical level of our party will never be raised, and the Chinese revolution will never be victorious." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 822)
    Comrade Mao Zedong said these words on February 1, 1942. Since the Party launched the rectification movement throughout the Party in 1942, the Party's work style has made great progress. More and more comrades in the Party, especially senior cadres, have learned the method of "shooting the arrow at the target." Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the development of the Chinese revolution has been rapid and extraordinary, with one victory after another. The problem of "arrow" and "target" mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong has become clearer and clearer, and the theoretical level of the Party has become higher and higher. By 1958, the Chinese revolution had developed to a new stage, and the three magic weapons of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune shone brightly. This was the result of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong being good at using the "arrow of Marxism-Leninism" to hit the "target of the Chinese revolution." This is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, and this is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The experience of Shashi and Luotian proves that the reason why the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought has endless power is that the whole Party and the whole people, especially the workers and peasants, can pick up this "arrow"! Just as the workers and peasants themselves said, what Chairman Mao said has all been said to our hearts. What Chairman Mao said is like a key, which immediately opens our minds. If you don't study Mao Zedong Thought, you won't be justified, you won't be strong, you won't be brave, and you won't be energetic; if you study Mao Zedong Thought, you will be justified, you will be ambitious, you will be brave, and you will be energetic. As long as workers and peasants pick up the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought, they will neither "shoot it randomly" nor "hold it in their hands and rub it," but rather "the arrow is on the string, and it has to be shot," and it is shot at the target, "hitting the target every time." From the articles published in this issue of "Qi Yi" magazine, we can see that the workers in Shashi are shooting "arrows" at the "target" of the seven battles of the technological revolution, and the peasants in Luotian are shooting "arrows" at the "target" of various tasks since 1958. The situation in Shashi and Luotian is simply an illustration of this sentence by Marx: Once theory is grasped by the masses, it will become an endless material force!
    As far as Hubei Province is concerned, it is not only Shashi and Luotian that have such experience, but all parts of the province have such experience, that is to say, all parts of the province are studying Mao Zedong Thought, publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, and acting in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. What is worth advocating is that the party organizations in Shashi and Luotian are doing this more consciously, more organized, and more planned, and the relationship between "arrow" and "target" is more clear. Therefore, both places have created a high tide of mass movement to study Mao Zedong Thought closely combined with the current central work, and have pushed the revolutionary mass movement forward wave after wave.
      The relationship between "arrow" and "target" is the relationship between theory and practice. Stalin was right: "Theory, if it is not linked with revolutionary practice, will become a theory without an object, and similarly, practice, if it is not guided by revolutionary theory, will become blind practice." Twisting theory and practice into one rope; shooting the arrow at the target and seeking truth from facts should become the purpose of our province's party work, and should become the work style of all party members and cadres in the province. It should also become the purpose of the theoretical publication "Qi Yi" magazine sponsored by the Provincial Party Committee.
    On the eve of the Party's birthday and on the eve of the second anniversary of the founding of "Qi Yi" magazine, it is absolutely necessary to earnestly summarize and promote the experiences of Shashi and Luotian in studying Mao Zedong Thought.

    “有的放矢”
    ——就沙市、罗田学习毛泽东思想的经验说几句话，
    并以此纪念《七一》杂志创刊二周年
    龚同文
    这一期的《七一》杂志上的许多文章，介绍了沙市、罗田学习毛泽东思想的经验。我看，可以用这四个字来概括他们的经验，这就是，“有的放矢”。
    什么叫做“有的放矢”？
    毛泽东同志说：
    “马克思列宁主义理论和中国革命实际，怎样互相联系呢？拿一句通俗的话来讲，就是‘有的放矢’。‘矢’就是箭，‘的’就是靶，放箭要对准靶。”
            （《毛泽东选集》，八二一页）
    没有比毛泽东思想这枝箭更好的了。毛泽东思想，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范，是马克思列宁主义在新的历史时期的新发展。革命和建设的实践证明，毛泽东思想对于中国革命，东方革命以及世界革命都有着现实的意义。学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，照毛泽东思想办事，是我们从胜利走向胜利的必由之路。沙市、罗田的党组织在广大工人农民当中掀起了学习毛泽东思想的群众运动。他们的做法是，做什么，学什么，边做边学，学用一致，把革命的理论和革命的实践扭成一股绳子。把毛泽东思想当做“箭”，把思想、生产、生活当中的实际问题当做“靶”，对准“靶”放“箭”，“一箭三雕”，获得了思想、生产、生活的全面丰收。这种做法，就是毛泽东同志所提倡的“有的放矢”和“实事求是”的做法。这种做法，和那些“头重脚轻根底浅，嘴尖皮厚腹中空”的教条主义者的做法，毫无相同之处；和那些披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，贩卖资产阶级货色的现代修正主义者的做法，更是毫无相同之处。
    毛泽东同志早就警告过“无的放矢”的人，也警告过“仅仅把箭拿在手里搓来搓去，连声赞曰：‘好箭！好箭！’却老是不愿意放出去”的人，他说，“马克思列宁主义之箭，必须用了去射中国革命之的。这个问题不讲明白，我们党的理论水平永远不会提高，中国革命也永远不会胜利。”（《毛泽东选集》，八二二页）
    毛泽东同志是在1942年2月1日说过这番话的。从1942年全党开展整风运动以后，党的作风有了极大的进步。党内的许多同志特别是高级干部，越来越多的人，学会了“有的放矢”的方法，在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导之下，中国革命的发展迅猛异常，一个胜利接着一个胜利。毛泽东同志所讲的“箭”和“靶”的问题越来越明白了，党的理论水平越来越提高了。到1958年，中国革命事业发展到了一个新的阶段，党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，大放异彩，这是以毛泽东同志为首的党中央善于运用“马克思列宁主义之箭”，射中了“中国革命之的”的结果，这是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    沙市、罗田的经验证明，毛泽东思想这支“箭”之所以有着无穷无尽的威力，就是因为全党全民特别是工人农民都能够拿起这支“箭”来！正像工人农民自己所说的，毛主席说的话，都说到我们心坎上来了。毛主席说的话，就像钥匙一样，一下子打开了我们的心窍。不学毛泽东思想，理不直，气不壮，胆不大，劲不足；学了毛泽东思想，就有理，有志，有胆，有劲。工人农民只要是拿起了毛泽东思想这枝“箭”，既不至于“乱放一通”，也不至于“拿在手上搓来搓去”，而是“箭在弦上，不得不发”，并且是对准靶子发箭，“百发百中”。从这一期《七一》杂志所发表的文章可以看到，沙市的工人，对准技术革命的七次战役的“靶”放“箭”，罗田的农民，对准1958年以来的各项工作的“靶”放“箭”。沙市和罗田的这种情景，简直就是马克思所说的这句话的插图：理论一经掌握了群众，就会变成无穷无尽的物质力量啊！
    就湖北省来说，不只是沙市和罗田有这样的经验，全省各地都有这样的经验，这就是说，各地都在学习毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想，照毛泽东思想办事。值得提倡的是，沙市和罗田的党组织在这方面做的更自觉一些，更有组织，有计划一些，“箭”和“靶”的关系更明确一些，因而，这两个地方都造成了紧密结合当前的中心工作学习毛泽东思想的群众运动的高潮，并且使革命的群众运动，一浪接一浪地向前推进。
      “矢”和“的”的关系，就是理论和实践的关系。斯大林说得对：“理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论，同样，实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践”。把理论和实践扭成一股绳子；有的放矢，实事求是，应当成为我们全省党的工作的宗旨，应当成为全省党员和干部的作风。也应当成为省委举办的理论刊物——《七一》杂志的宗旨。
    在党的生日的前夕，在《七一》杂志创刊二周年的前夕，认真地总结和推广沙市、罗田学习毛泽东思想的经验是完全必要的。
