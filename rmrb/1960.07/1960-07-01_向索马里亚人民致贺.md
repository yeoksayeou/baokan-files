Following the declaration of independence by British Somaliland, the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland also formally declared independence today. These two sister states have also decided to merge after independence. On the occasion of the establishment of the Somali Republic, the Chinese people extend warm congratulations to the Somali people.

Independence is the goal that the people of Somaliland have yearned for and struggled for over the years. As everyone knows, at the end of the 19th century, Italian colonialists, together with British and French imperialists, divided the Somali Peninsula into three colonies. Although the colonialists carried out massacres and suppression against the people of Somaliland, they failed to conquer this heroic nation. After the Second World War, the flames of striving for national independence rose even higher on the land of Somaliland. In 1949, in order to protest the United Nations' illegal passage, under the manipulation of the United States, of a proposal for a so-called ten-year trusteeship that violated the will of the people of Somaliland and covered up the resurgence of Italian colonialists, the people of Somaliland, disregarding the suppression of the then British occupation authorities, held massive demonstrations. On February 25 last year, a large-scale demonstration broke out in Somaliland, and the masses of the people bravely fought with knives, guns, and sticks against the police sent by the colonial authorities to suppress them. The Italian colonialists have already discovered that in the face of the surging national independence movement throughout Africa, it is difficult for them to cope with the situation in Somaliland. As the Italian newspapers admitted, "Just as African countries are gaining independence one after another, it is difficult to find any sluice gate to stop the rising Somaliland nationalism."

However, it should be pointed out that while the old Italian colonialists are increasingly losing ground in Somaliland, the new American colonialists are accelerating the pace of colonial expansion into Somaliland. After the war, the American imperialists took advantage of the weakening of Italian colonial forces and tried to gradually control Somaliland. In 1954, American imperialism forced Italy to sign the "Somaliland Economic Development Technical Assistance Agreement." Through this agreement, the United States seized many privileges from the Italian colonialists, such as implementing the "Point Four Program," the "oil mining rights," and allowing the United States to establish church schools, etc. At the same time, a large number of Americans poured into Somaliland. According to statistics at the beginning of 1959, 2,000 Americans were engaged in activities in Somaliland. There are five American oil companies in Somaliland, and they are conducting oil "exploration" throughout Somaliland. The purpose of this "exploration" by the United States is not only to plunder Somaliland's oil resources, but also to determine the location for the establishment of military bases, so that after the bases are built in the future, they can be integrated with the American military bases in Kenya and Eritrea, and further control the entire East Africa and the Red Sea. The American imperialists have been clamoring to "fill" the so-called "huge vacuum" in Africa. Its true meaning is for the United States to replace the positions of those old colonial countries. What the United States is carrying out in Somaliland is precisely such a dirty colonial deal. There is no doubt that the Somali people will increasingly realize that the new American colonialists have become the biggest obstacle to the further development of Somaliland's national independence.

With the independence of Somalia, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Somali peoples will develop. However, it must be pointed out that in order to implement its colonial conspiracy to enslave Somalia, American imperialism is doing everything possible to undermine the friendship and unity between the Somali people and the people of Asian countries, especially to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Somali peoples. The Somaliland Office in Cairo recently issued a statement exposing that American imperialism instigated Somaliland officials to "invite" the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the Chinese people, to participate in its independence ceremony. However, as the above-mentioned statement pointed out, this shameless conspiracy of American imperialism aroused "great indignation" among all Somaliland "political, religious and social organizations." We believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Somali peoples, and the friendship between China and the peoples of all African countries cannot be undermined by any imperialist forces.

### 向索马里亚人民致贺

    向索马里亚人民致贺
    继英属索马里兰宣告独立之后，意大利托管的索马里兰今天也正式宣布独立。这两个姊妹国家并且已经决定在独立后进行合并。在此索马里亚共和国成立之际，中国人民特向索马里亚人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    独立，这是索马里兰人民多少年来所热烈向往而为之斗争的目标。大家知道，意大利殖民者在十九世纪末叶与英法帝国主义一起，把索马里半岛瓜分为三个殖民地。尽管殖民者对索马里兰人民进行屠杀和镇压，但是，它们没有能够征服这个英勇的民族。第二次世界大战结束后，在索马里兰的土地上更高地升起了争取民族独立的火焰。1949年，为了抗议联合国在美国操纵下非法通过违反索马里兰人民意愿、掩护意大利殖民者卷土重来的所谓托管十年的提案，索马里兰人民不顾当时英国占领当局的镇压，举行了声势浩大的示威。去年2月25日，索马里兰爆发了大规模示威，人民群众英勇地用刀枪棍棒同殖民当局派来镇压他们的警察展开搏斗。意大利殖民者已经发现，在整个非洲民族独立运动汹涌澎湃的形势下，它已难于应付索马里兰的局面了。正如意大利报纸所承认，“正当非洲国家一个接着一个获得独立的时候，很难找到任何关闸来制止索马里兰民族主义的高涨。”
    但是，应该指出，在意大利旧殖民者在索马里兰日益失势的时候，美国新殖民主义者加速了向索马里兰进行殖民扩张的步伐。战后，美帝国主义利用意大利殖民势力的削弱，力图把索马里兰逐步控制在自己的手中。1954年美帝国主义强迫意大利和它签订“索马里兰经济发展技术援助协定”，美国通过这一协定，从意大利殖民者手中攫取了许多特权，如执行“第四点计划”，“石油开采权”和许可美国建立教会学校等等。与此同时，大批美国人员涌入索马里兰。据1959年年初的统计，就有二千名美国人到索马里兰进行活动。美国在索马里兰有五家石油公司，它们在索马里兰全境进行石油“勘探”。美国这种“勘探”的目的不仅在于掠夺索马里兰的石油资源，还在于确定建立军事基地的位置，以便将来建成基地后和美国在怯尼亚和厄兰特里亚的军事基地连成一体，进而控制整个东非和红海。美帝国主义者一直在叫嚷要在非洲“填补”所谓的“巨大真空”。其真实含意就是由美国取代那些老牌殖民国家的地位。美国在索马里兰进行着的正是这样一种肮脏的殖民勾当。毫无疑问，索马里亚人民将会日益认清，美国新殖民主义者已经成为进一步发展索马里兰民族独立的最大的障碍。
    随着索马里亚的独立，中国和索马里亚人民之间的友好关系将会获得发展。但是不能不指出，美帝国主义为了实施其奴役索马里亚的殖民阴谋，正在千方百计地破坏索马里亚人民与亚洲各国人民之间的友谊和团结，特别是要破坏中国和索马里亚人民之间的友好关系。索马里兰驻开罗办事处不久前发表声明揭露，美帝国主义唆使索马里兰负责人士“邀请”被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团参加它的独立典礼。但是，正如上述声明所指出，美帝国主义这一无耻的阴谋激起了所有索马里兰“政治、宗教和社会组织”的“非常愤慨”。我们相信，中国和索马里亚人民之间的友谊、中国和所有非洲国家人民之间的友谊是任何帝国主义势力也破坏不了的。
