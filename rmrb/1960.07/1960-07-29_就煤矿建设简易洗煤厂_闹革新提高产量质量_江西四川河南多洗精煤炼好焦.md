Building Simple Coal Washeries at Coal Mines, Making Innovations to Increase Production and Quality
Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Henan Wash Fine Coal to Produce Good Coke

    (By Our Newspaper) Jiangxi Province has built a large number of simple coal washeries to ensure high and quality pig iron production. The washing capacity of newly built and expanded coal washeries has increased more than threefold compared with the same period last year.
    These coal washeries were built under the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. For example, the Pinghu coal washery, which can wash 600,000 tons of coal annually, launched a mass movement and carried out technological innovations during the construction process. It completed more than a year's worth of work in just over four months, reducing investment by about 80%. The production process of these coal washeries, due to the maximum use of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and new technologies, is not only highly efficient but also of good quality. Currently, the average ash content of the washed fine coal in various coal washeries is only about 11%, meeting quality standards.
    In accordance with the principle of combining mining and washing, these coal washeries are all built in coal mining areas. Key coal mines such as Pingxiang, Fengcheng, and Tianhe have coal washeries with corresponding washing capacities, greatly saving transportation volume and increasing production capacity. By the end of June, the province's fine coal production had overfulfilled half of the annual national plan, not only meeting the needs of the province's iron and steel production but also supporting large iron and steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel.
    (By Our Newspaper) Sichuan Province, adapting to the development of small local iron and steel plants, has built fifteen simple coal washeries in the province's key coal producing areas, washing a large amount of fine coal to supply coking needs.
    Sichuan Province's simple coal washeries were gradually built after the great iron and steel campaign in 1958. When constructing these coal washeries, local Party committees adopted the method of unified leadership, unified arrangement, and concentrated material and human resources for a rapid construction push, quickly completing and putting them into production.
    Since the second quarter of this year, various simple coal washeries have strengthened production management in response to the weak links in production, and have attached importance to equipment maintenance and repair. 80% of cadres went deep into the workshops, implementing the "four togethers" (eating, living, working, and discussing together), helping to solve key problems in production, so production has continued to rise and output has increased month by month. In June, the fine coal washed by various simple coal washeries in the province increased by 34.28% compared to May, ensuring the coking needs of key iron and steel areas.
    (By Our Newspaper) Under the guidance of the idea of "guaranteeing steel with coal," workers at coal washeries in Henan Province have launched a vigorous technological revolution to improve coal washing production and quality. In the second quarter, the average daily production level of coal washing in the province increased by 20.74% compared with the first quarter. In July, the province's coal washing output continued to increase.
    In the movement to increase coal washing production, leading cadres of various factories went deep into the front line, conscientiously grasped production, and ensured that production was prepared every month, ensuring that coal washing output increased month by month. The Party Secretary and Director of the No. 2 and No. 3 Coal Washeries of the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau went down to the grassroots level, dividing up the work and contracting areas of responsibility, seizing the weak links to fight hard battles, which greatly reduced equipment accidents and increased the daily operating time from eleven hours to more than fifteen hours. They also changed the three-stage coal washing to two-stage coal washing, reducing screen accidents and increasing the recovery rate of fine coal.
    Launching a vigorous technological innovation and revolution around the key to production is one of the main reasons why the production of various coal washeries has been continuously improved. For example, the Yiluo Coal Washery built an earthen coal storage in front of the original belt conveyor corridor and installed a coal crusher, ensuring timely supply of raw coal. Since the plant was put into production this year, the output has risen linearly, completing half of the annual plan thirty-nine days ahead of schedule.

### 就煤矿建设简易洗煤厂　闹革新提高产量质量  江西四川河南多洗精煤炼好焦

    就煤矿建设简易洗煤厂　闹革新提高产量质量
    江西四川河南多洗精煤炼好焦
    本报讯　江西省为保证生铁高产优质，已经建设了大批简易洗煤厂。新建、扩建洗煤厂的洗煤能力，比去年同期增长三倍多。
    这批洗煤厂是在多快好省的原则下兴建起来的。如每年能洗煤六十万吨的坪湖洗煤厂，在建厂过程中大搞群众运动，开展技术革新，只用四个多月就完成了一年多的工程量，投资降低了80％左右。这批洗煤厂的生产过程，由于尽量采取机械化、半机械化和新技术，不仅生产效率高，而且质量好。目前各洗煤厂洗出的精煤平均灰份只有11％左右，合乎质量标准。
    按照采掘、洗选结合的原则，这些洗煤厂都建立在煤矿区。萍乡、丰城、天河等重点煤矿，都建有洗选能力相适应的洗煤厂，大大地节省了运输量，提高了生产能力。到6月底，全省精煤生产已超额完成全年国家计划的一半，不仅供应了本省钢铁生产的需要，而且支援了武钢等大型钢铁企业。
    本报讯　四川省适应钢铁小洋群的发展，已在省内各重点产煤区建设了十五个简易洗煤厂，大量洗选精煤，供应炼焦需要。
    四川省的简易洗煤厂，是从1958年大办钢铁以后逐步建设起来的。在建设这些洗煤厂时，各地党委都采取了统一领导、统一安排、集中物力人力突击建设的方法，在短时间内即迅速建成，投入生产。
    今年二季度以来，各简易洗煤厂针对生产中的薄弱环节加强了生产管理，重视了设备维护和检修。80％的干部深入车间，实行同吃同住同劳动同商量，帮助解决生产中的关键问题，因而生产不断上升，产量逐月提高。6月份，全省各简易洗煤厂洗出的精煤，比5月份增长了34.28％，保证了重点钢铁地区炼焦需要。
    本报讯　河南省各洗煤厂职工在以煤保钢的思想指导下，大闹技术革命，提高洗煤产量质量，第二季全省洗煤平均日产水平比第一季度提高20.74％。7月份，全省洗煤产量又有增长。
    在增产洗煤的运动中，各厂领导干部深入第一线，扎扎实实抓生产，做到月月生产有准备，保证了洗煤产量逐月上升。平顶山矿务局二、三矿洗煤厂的党委书记、厂长下到基层，分工包干，抓住薄弱环节打攻坚战，使设备事故大大减少，每日运转时间由十一小时提高到十五小时以上。他们还将三段洗煤改为两段洗煤，减少了筛子事故，提高了精煤回收率。
    围绕生产关键，大闹技术革新和技术革命，是各洗煤厂生产不断提高的主要原因之一。例如宜洛洗煤厂在原皮带走廊头前建设土煤仓，安装了碎煤机，做到原煤及时供应，使全厂今年投入生产以来，产量直线上升，提前三十九天完成了全年计划的一半。
