　　The story takes place in the Nursery Primary School of the Jinan Garrison in Shandong.
　　The meal bell had rung for a while. The sixth-grade classroom was far from the dining hall, and the students had not yet arrived. Seeing this, the fifth-grade students took the initiative to portion out the food for their older brothers and sisters.
　　The sixth-grade students were moved by this spirit of unity and mutual assistance. The members of the troop committee and the cadres of the small team held an emergency meeting to discuss ways to repay them. The students in these two classes washed their faces together every morning. There were only four faucets in the washroom, and it took a long time when people crowded together. The sixth-grade students came up with a solution: every morning, they would arrange the washbasins and mugs of their younger siblings neatly and fill them with water in advance.
　　Incidents like this are common in the Nursery Primary School of the Jinan Garrison. The cultivation of the children's spirit of unity and mutual assistance is inseparable from the patient revolutionary tradition education conducted by Li Mingyu, the principal of the school and a demobilized soldier.

　　老革命培育的新花朵
    故事发生在山东济南驻军的保育小学里。
    开饭的钟声，响过多一会了。六年级的教室离食堂较远，同学们还没有赶来。五年级的学生看到这种情景，就主动给哥哥姐姐们分菜。
    六年级的同学，被这种团结互助的精神感动了。中队委员和小队的干部召开了紧急会议，研究报答他们的办法。这两个班的同学，每天早上都在一起洗脸。漱洗室只有四个水龙头，人一挤，就要等很长时间。六年级的同学想出了一个办法：每天早晨把弟弟妹妹们的洗脸盆、牙缸摆得整整齐齐，而且都事先倒进了清水。
    像这样的事情，在济南驻军保育小学里，经常可以碰到。孩子们团结互助精神的养成，是和这个学校校长、转业军人李鸣玉的耐心地进行革命传统教育分不开的。
