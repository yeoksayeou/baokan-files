Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th -- The news of the murder of overseas Chinese women, Ye Jinniang and Yang Mumei, from Cimahi, Indonesia, by West Java troops at the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, has aroused great indignation among the villagers in the victims' hometown, Yuxi Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province. On the afternoon of the 7th, the township held a rally attended by more than 1,800 people to protest this bloody crime of slaughtering overseas Chinese women, resulting in two deaths and three lives lost.

Huang Guoquan, Deputy Township Chief of Yuxi Township, expressed condolences to the two victims on behalf of the 80,000 people of the township at the meeting, extended cordial sympathy to the families of the deceased, and lodged a serious protest to the Indonesian government. Subsequently, Lin Bingwang, the biological son of the victim Ye Jinniang, tearfully denounced at the meeting the atrocities of the powerful Indonesian groups instigating the West Java troops to kill his mother. This 17-year-old returned overseas Chinese student, filled with grief and indignation, cried out at the meeting: "I am sad! I am angry! I want to accuse the murderers to the whole world!" He said: "My mother was a hardworking and kind woman. She worked hard in the Cimahi area for more than 20 years, diligently engaging in planting and petty trading, and devoted her efforts to the prosperity of the local economy and to serving the Indonesian people. Now she has been brutally murdered by Indonesian reactionaries and deprived of her life for no reason. I want to question the murderers: What crime did my mother commit? The Indonesian government should immediately severely punish the murderers and repay this blood debt!" At this moment, the venue became an ocean of anger, and more than a thousand villagers roared in unison: "Punish the murderers! We will never allow powerful Indonesian groups to persecute our compatriots!"

Guo Yougui, the brother-in-law of the victim Ye Jinniang, Lin Binggao, the nephew, and Lin Minyan and Lin Minwei, the nephews of the victim Yang Mumei, also angrily denounced at the meeting the bloody crimes of the powerful Indonesian groups instigating the West Java troops to kill their relatives. Lin Minyan, a returned overseas Chinese student currently studying at Fuqing County No. 4 Middle School, said angrily: "After the murderers killed my aunt Yang Mumei, they also snatched the body and washed away the bloodstains, attempting to cover up the crime of murder." He said: "Murderers are murderers, and in the face of the righteous people of the world, this crime cannot be denied."

Gao Zhirong, Deputy County Chief of Fuqing County, Chairman of the County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, also came from Gaoshan Township, more than a hundred miles away, to attend the meeting. At the meeting, Gao Zhirong expressed condolences on behalf of the people of the county and the returned overseas Chinese and their families to the two deceased fellow villagers, and expressed a solemn protest against the atrocities of the West Java soldiers who brutally killed overseas Chinese. On the same afternoon, returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students from Fuqing County No. 1 Middle School and Overseas Chinese Middle School, who lived in Fuqing County, also held rallies with thousands of people participating.

    控诉西爪哇军队杀人罪行
    死难华侨家乡人民集会抗议
    据新华社福州8日电　印度尼西亚芝马圩华侨妇女叶金娘、杨木妹被印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队杀害的消息，传到死难者的家乡福建省福清县渔溪乡时，激起了乡亲们的极大愤慨。7日下午，这个乡举行了一千八百多人参加的大会，抗议这一屠杀华侨妇女、造成两尸三命的血腥罪行。
    渔溪乡副乡长黄国泉，代表全乡八万人民在大会上向两位受害者致以哀悼，对死难者的家属致以亲切的慰问，并向印度尼西亚政府提出严重抗议。接着，被害者叶金娘的亲生儿子林秉望，噙着眼泪在会上悲愤控诉印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队杀死他母亲的暴行。这个年仅十七岁的归侨学生，满腔悲愤地在会上疾呼：“我悲痛！我愤怒！我要向全世界控告杀人犯！”他说：“我的母亲是个勤劳善良的妇女，她在茂物和芝马圩一带苦心经营种植业和小商贩二十多年，为繁荣当地经济和为印度尼西亚人民服务花了心血。现在竟然惨遭印度尼西亚反动分子的毒手，无故被夺去了生命。我要质问杀人犯：我的母亲究竟犯了什么罪？印度尼西亚政府应当立即严惩杀人凶犯，还我这笔血债！”这时，会场上成了愤怒的海洋，一千多个乡亲同声怒吼：“惩办凶手！绝不允许印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害我们的侨胞！”
    受害者叶金娘的姑婿郭友贵、侄儿林秉高和受害者杨木妹的侄儿林民砚、林民威等也纷纷在会上愤怒地控诉印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队杀害他们亲人的血腥罪行。现在福清县第四中学高中部读书的归侨学生林民砚，愤怒地说：“杀人犯把我的婶婶杨木妹杀死后，还把尸体抢走，用水冲洗血迹，企图掩盖杀人罪责。”他说：“杀人犯就是杀人犯，在全世界正义人民面前，这一罪行是抵赖不了的。”
    福清县副县长、县侨联主席、印度尼西亚归侨高至荣，这天也特地从百多里外的高山乡赶来参加大会。高至荣在会上代表全县人民和归侨、侨眷对两位死难的乡侨表示哀悼，对西爪哇军人惨杀侨胞的暴行表示严正抗议。同日下午，居住在福清县城的归侨、侨眷和福清县第一中学、华侨中学的归侨学生，也分别举行有数千人参加的大会。
