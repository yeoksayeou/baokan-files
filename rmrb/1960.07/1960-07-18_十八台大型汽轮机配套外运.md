Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 17th: The Harbin Steam Turbine Factory has assembled the eighteen large steam turbines slated for completion in the first half of the year and is shipping them in batches to Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, Taiyuan, and other locations.

The experience of the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory proves that Party committee leaders going deep into the field to solve key problems is an effective method for ensuring the timely assembly of products. For over a month, the factory's Party committee has placed the product assembly work in an extremely important position. Based on the main crucial points of product assembly, they divided the work into five areas: raw materials, small and medium-sized components, blades, large parts processing, and complete set delivery. Party committee leaders were assigned responsibility for each area, focusing on assembly work from the first process. Workshops, work sections, and relevant departments also assigned dedicated personnel at each level to be responsible for this work, ensuring the smooth completion of the product assembly tasks.

Another experience of the Steam Turbine Factory in focusing on product assembly is mobilizing the masses to carry out a "one-dragon" competition, forming a mass movement throughout the factory where everyone is concerned about assembly. In the "one-dragon" competition, each workshop and work section incorporated the key components for assembly into the production plan, ensuring that the plan was implemented at each level and that upper and lower processes were interconnected. Recently, the main engine urgently needed rotating baffles for assembly, but the sheet metal workshop, which processes the rotating baffles, was temporarily unable to complete the task due to heavy workload. Therefore, the main engine workshop immediately sent fitters and machinists to support the sheet metal workshop, ensuring the timely completion of the rotating baffle processing task.

### 十八台大型汽轮机配套外运

　　十八台大型汽轮机配套外运
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　哈尔滨汽轮机厂已经把上半年要配套的十八台大型汽轮机配好，正在分批运往天津、上海、山东、太原等地。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂的经验证明：党委领导干部深入现场，解决关键问题，是保证产品及时配套的有效方法。近一个多月来，这个厂党委把产品配套工作放在极为重要的地位，并且根据产品配套的几个主要关键，分成毛坯、中小配套、叶片、大件加工、发货成套等五个部分，由党委领导干部分工负责，从第一道工序开始就大抓配套工作；车间、工段和有关科室也层层设专人负责这项工作，保证了产品配套任务的顺利完成。
    汽轮机厂狠抓产品配套的另一个经验是发动群众开展一条龙竞赛，在全厂形成人人关心配套的群众运动。在一条龙竞赛中，各车间、工段都把配套的关键部件安排在生产计划中，使计划层层落实、上下工序相互衔接。最近主机急需转动隔板以便配套，而加工转动隔板的冷作车间由于任务较重，一时不能完成，于是主机车间就立刻派钳工和车工到这个车间支援，保证了转动隔板加工任务的及时完成。
