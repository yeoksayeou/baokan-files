    Remembering Chairman Mao's Words
    Zhang Nanxian
    Our Chairman Mao, said two years ago: American imperialism is using a rope to tighten its own neck. This famous saying has spread throughout China and abroad, but the foolish pigs still don't realize it. Now, when their life is threatened, they still act as if they have a brilliant plan. They shamelessly fly to the Far East, changing their tune everywhere. We bombard them with criticism, and they are met with closed doors everywhere. They scurry back to their old home, with the rope around their necks cheered by ten thousand people. Our six hundred million people, holding the rope, will pull it with all our might to recover our Taiwan and return our territory to the motherland. Calling on the whole world to defeat this human thief. The rope is in our hands, let us fight together tightly! To strangle the scourge of mankind, so that white doves can fly across the globe.

    想起毛主席的话
    张难先我们毛主席，二年以前说：美帝国主义，用索自套脖。名言传中外，蠢猪竟不觉。到今要命时，还像有上策，厚颜飞远东，处处都变色，我们炮轰它，闭门羹日设，鼠窜回老家，索头万人得。我国六亿人，持索拚命勒，收复我台湾，领土归祖国。号召全世界，打垮人类贼，索在我们手，一起紧紧搏！绞死害人精，全球飞白鸽。
