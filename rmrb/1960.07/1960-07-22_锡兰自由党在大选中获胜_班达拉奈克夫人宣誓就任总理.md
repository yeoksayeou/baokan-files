    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, July 21st: The Sri Lanka Freedom Party once again defeated the ruling United National Party in the general election on the 20th, winning half of the seats in the House of Representatives. The chairman of the Freedom Party, the widow of the late Prime Minister Bandaranaike, has accepted the task of forming a new cabinet and was sworn in this afternoon as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    After being sworn in, Sirimavo Bandaranaike told reporters that the Freedom Party will continue to pursue the non-aligned, neutral foreign policy established by her husband. She also said that the Freedom Party will not depart from the policies and programs laid down by Bandaranaike.

    In this election, the Freedom Party, the Communist Party of Ceylon, and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party reached a non-competition agreement, and all three parties increased their seats in this election. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party won seventy-five of the one hundred and fifty-one seats elected, an increase of twenty-nine seats compared to its seats in the previous parliament. The Communist Party of Ceylon won four seats, an increase of one from the past. The chairman of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wickremasinghe, and the General Secretary, Keuneman, both defeated the United National Party candidates in this election and were elected. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party won twelve seats, an increase of two from the past.

    In this election, the United National Party only won thirty seats, a decrease of twenty seats from its original seats. The United National Party has always opposed the takeover of foreign enterprises and advocated encouraging and assisting private and foreign capital to participate in Sri Lanka's "economic development work." It tried its best to incite anti-communist sentiment in this election.
