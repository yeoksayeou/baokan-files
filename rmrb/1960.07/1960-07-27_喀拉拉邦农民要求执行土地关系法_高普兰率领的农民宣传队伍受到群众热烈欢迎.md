Xinhua News Agency, 26th. According to Indian newspapers, a thirty-member farmer team led by A. K. Gopalan, president of the All-India Kisan Sabha, arrived in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, on the evening of the 24th, after walking 400 miles from the northern end of Kerala to the southern end, demanding the swift implementation of the Land Relations Act enacted by the former Kerala state government led by the Communist Party of India.

According to the "Hindustan Times," when the farmer team arrived in Trivandrum on the 24th, a demonstration was held in the city. Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Namboodiripad, and Gopalan both spoke at a public gathering, demanding the implementation of the Land Relations Act and opposing any revisions that would adversely affect farmers.

The team led by Gopalan visited villages and towns along the 400-mile coastline and was warmly welcomed by the farmers.

According to the Malayalam-language "Patriot," when the team arrived in Quilon County, a crowded mass awaited them in heavy rain. In Mullakkuzhy, many farm women and children enthusiastically received them, set off fireworks for them, and donated money at the meeting. In Chengannur, Alappuzha County, large crowds lined the roads to welcome the team, while some landlords unleashed vicious dogs to obstruct and sabotage the team's progress, injuring five farmers as a result.

As the farmer team led by Gopalan traveled through various regions, many small farmer teams also went deep into the countryside to organize farmers to march towards Trivandrum and to raise funds for them.

It is reported that the Kerala Land Relations Act was submitted to the President for his approval before the Indian Communist Party-led state government was dissolved last year, but the President has been shelving it ever since, wanting the current State Legislative Assembly to re-debate it. According to the "New Kerala" on June 5th, the Congress-People's Socialist Party coalition government of this state intends to make major changes to the original provisions of the bill concerning the maximum land holding limit, certain items of land exemption, and compensation to landlords.

    喀拉拉邦农民要求执行土地关系法
    高普兰率领的农民宣传队伍受到群众热烈欢迎
    新华社26日讯　据印度报纸报道，由全印农民协会主席高普兰率领的一支三十人的农民队伍为了要求迅速执行印度共产党领导的前喀拉拉邦政府所制定的土地关系法案，在从喀拉拉邦北端到南端徒步走了四百英里之后，24日晚上到达喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅。
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，当这支农民队伍在24日到达特里凡得琅时，城内举行了示威。印度共产党代理总书记南布迪里巴德和高普兰都在公众集会上讲了话，要求执行土地关系法案，反对作出任何对农民产生不利影响的修改。
    高普兰率领的队伍曾经访问了沿着四百英里海岸长的村庄和市镇，受到农民热烈欢迎。
    据马拉雅兰文的“爱国者报”报道，当队伍到达奎隆县时，拥挤的人群在大雨中迎候他们。在穆拉库齐，很多农妇和孩子热情地接待他们，为他们放焰火，并且在大会上捐款。在阿勒皮县的琴甘诺尔，大堆的人群沿着马路两旁欢迎队伍到来，一些地主却放出恶狗来阻挠破坏队伍行进，有五个农民因此受伤。
    当高普兰率领的农民队伍在各地行进时，许多农民小队也深入农村，组织农民向特里凡得琅前进，并且为他们募集基金。
    据报道，喀拉拉邦的土地关系法在去年印度共产党领导的邦政府被解散前，已送交总统要他批准，但是总统至今搁在那里，要让现在的邦立法会议重新辩论。据6月5日的“新喀拉拉报”报道，这个邦的国大党——人民社会党联合政府已打算就法案原来有关土地持有最高限额、土地豁免的某些项目以及对地主的赔偿等条款规定作重大的改动。
