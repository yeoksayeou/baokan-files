    Nan Sanlian Island
    Hua Jia
    In the past, Nan Sanlian Island was not one island, it was originally eleven small islands, like eleven dull little pearls that had been discarded, thrown far outside Zhanjiang Port, exposed to wind and rain, and subjected to the ravages of the sea. During typhoon days, the wind swept up yellow sand, submerging countless fields, houses, and the lives and property of the people.
    Now, Nan Sanlian Island is a large island. Countless dikes have linked the ten small islands together, leaving only one small island as a waterway. The 66-li-long windbreak forest around the island is like a green Great Wall protecting this precious island. Typhoons, yellow sand, and howling tides, these harmful winds and sands, can now only linger outside the gate of the Lian Island, unable to wreak havoc and disaster again.
    A barren island transformed into a treasure island, a desert turned into an oasis, what a tremendous change! No wonder people say that talking about the great changes in Zhanjiang over the past decade should start with Nan Sanlian Island.
    In the early days of liberation, the laboring people of Nan Sanlian Island, responding to the Party's great call to green the wasteland and control the wind and sand, had already begun this arduous battle to conquer nature. When the land reform was victoriously completed, I first visited Zhanjiang. The laboring people of Nan Sanlian Island, encouraged by the victory over class enemies, pressed forward and opened fire on natural enemies. One mutual aid team collected a large pile of jars and pots, painstakingly cultivating and breeding casuarina seedlings. After a year, the casuarinas transplanted to the wasteland were already more than ten feet tall. Thus, the battle to build a windbreak Great Wall began on a large scale. Year after year of hard struggle, from more than three thousand plants to more than one hundred and ninety thousand plants, watching the soil of such a large wasteland has changed, and the planted grains are growing so lovely, how excited people are! However, when a 12-magnitude typhoon struck, this demon took everything away again.
    What to do? The laboring people of the Mao Zedong era are not intimidated by any difficulties. Determined to drive out the typhoon! Windbreak forests must be planted faster, and that's not enough, so simply block the sea and build dikes to connect the ten small islands together!
    In 1955, the earth-shattering feat of blocking the sea and linking the islands unfolded. One small dike after another, one large dike after another, one small island connected to another, one windbreak forest after another... People worked desperately, day and night, in wind and rain, with the unwavering will of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. When the bugle of the Great Leap Forward sounded in 1958, people's enthusiasm soared, saying that they would complete it a year ahead of schedule after a year of hard work. Sure enough, in this great year of the socialist Great Leap Forward, Nan Sanlian Island was built.
    Please take a look at Nan Sanlian Island today! It has built 28,400 mu of arable land, turning grain-deficient areas into surplus-grain areas; it has reclaimed such a vast area of salt fields from the sea, producing 300,000 dan annually, turning desolate sandy beaches into happy salt seas. ... Is this enough? No. The laboring people of Nan Sanlian Island, who move mountains and fill seas, will continue to fight the ocean. The South China Sea Dike completed this year is just the prelude to a large-scale combat plan. According to the plan, they are preparing to build outer dikes at long distances at the tips of each island. At that time, the land reclaimed from the sea will be several times greater than in the past. They want to catch up with the Yinggehai Salt Field on Hainan Island, and they want to build a chemical industry island. They want to make this treasure island outside Zhanjiang Port, like a priceless bright pearl, shine brightly with the brilliant light of the Mao Zedong era. ...

    南三联岛
    华嘉
    从前，南三联岛不是一个岛，它原是十一个小岛，好比被人丢弃的十一颗暗淡无光的小明珠，远远地抛在湛江港外，让它风吹雨打，任海水欺凌。在台风的日子里，风卷着黄沙，淹没了多少田地、房屋和人民的生命财产。
    现在，南三联岛是一个大岛了。无数堤围把十个小岛联在一起，只留下一个小岛来作航道。环岛六十六里长的防风林，好像一条绿色的长城保护着这个宝岛。台风、黄沙、呼啸的海潮，这些害人的风沙，从此只好在联岛的大门外徘徊，再也无力肆虐为灾了。
    荒岛变成宝岛，沙漠变成绿洲，这是多么巨大的变化啊！怪不得人们都说，十年巨变话湛江，应该从南三联岛说起了。
    南三联岛的劳动人民，在解放初期，响应党的绿化荒滩、制服风沙的伟大号召，早就开始了这一场征服自然的艰苦战斗。土地改革胜利完成的时候，我初访湛江，南三联岛的劳动人民在战胜阶级敌人的鼓舞下，乘胜追击，向自然敌人开火。一个互助组，收集了一大堆坛坛罐罐，苦心栽培育种木麻黄的秧苗。过了一年，移植到荒滩上来的木麻黄，已经一丈多高，于是，建筑防风长城的战斗大规模的开始了。一年又一年的苦斗，从三千多株发展到十九万多株，眼看着偌大一片荒地的土壤已经改观，种下的粮食都长得这么可爱，人们是多么兴高采烈啊！可是，一场十二级的台风刮来，这恶魔又把什么都抢走了。
    这怎么办？毛泽东时代的劳动人民，是什么困难也吓不倒的。决心把台风赶出去！防风林要更快的种下去，这还不成，索性堵海筑堤，把十个小岛联在一起！
    1955年，堵海联岛的壮举惊天动地的展开了。一条小堤又一条小堤，一条大堤又一条大堤，一个小岛连起一个小岛，一座防风林接着一座防风林，……人们以愚公移山一样坚定不移的意志，不管白天黑夜、风吹雨打，拼命地干。到1958年的大跃进号角吹响，人们的干劲冲天，说苦战一年提前完成，果然，就在这个伟大的社会主义大跃进年头，南三联岛建成了。
    请看看今天的南三联岛吧！它建成了二万八千四百亩耕地，缺粮区变成余粮区；它向大海索取了那么宽广的一片盐田，年产三十万担，荒凉沙滩变成幸福盐海。……这满足了吗？不。移山填海的南三联岛劳动人民，还要继续向海洋作战。今年完成的南海大堤，只是大规模作战计划的序幕。按照规划，他们准备在各岛尖端的远距离筑成外围的大堤，那时候，向大海索取的土地将比过去的要超过好几倍。他们要赶上海南岛的英歌海盐场，他们要建成化学工业岛。他们要使湛江港外这个宝岛，好像一颗价值连城的大明珠，光芒四射的闪耀着毛泽东时代的灿烂光辉。……
