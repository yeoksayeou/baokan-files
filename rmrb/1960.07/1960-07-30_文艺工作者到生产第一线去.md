    Our literary and art workers must continue to follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, wholeheartedly go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggle, go to this only, broadest, and richest source of creation, enthusiastically praise new things and new heroic figures, and express the struggle of revolutionary new things against old things that hinder revolutionary progress, to serve the great cause of socialism and communism.
    ——Lu Dingyi's congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers
    Literary and Art Workers Go to the Production Front Line
    Wang Zhongyin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee
    Last winter and this spring, in order to implement the Central Committee's instructions on vigorously developing water conservancy, the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee mobilized more than 10 million laborers to the water conservancy front line to build many large and medium-sized reservoir projects and canals, embankments, bridges, and culverts. The largest and most important of these is the Weishan Hub project that "bisects the Yellow River." After the completion of these water conservancy projects, they can irrigate 70% of the province's farmland and create extremely favorable conditions for overcoming major droughts and floods and ensuring continuous bumper harvests in agricultural production. This is a great and arduous feat of promoting benefits and eliminating harms, and is another declaration of war by the people of Shandong against nature.
    The situation and tasks put forward to our political work and propaganda mobilization workers such a glorious and urgent task: to strengthen political and ideological work on the water conservancy front and resolutely ensure the completion of production tasks. Therefore, the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee issued a combat call to literary and art workers throughout the province: organize literary and art service groups to go to the construction sites, go to the production front line, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to carry out propaganda and mobilization work, to perform, sing, and write, to train themselves, and to improve themselves. As a result, the Shandong Provincial "Bisecting the Yellow River" Literary and Art Service Group was organized; literary and art service groups for "Bisecting the Yi River," "Bisecting the Wei River"... marched to the front line; during this period, literary and art service groups for five heroic meetings of industry, agriculture, women, militia, and culture and education were also organized. Participating in the service groups were heads of literary and art departments, writers, artists, various literary and art workers, and some teachers and students from universities and colleges, totaling about 1,500 people, creating more than 700,000 words of various forms of literary works, more than 5,000 pieces of various forms of art works, and collecting more than 2,000 folk songs; performing for the masses more than 180 times, with an audience of about 330,000 people.
    Now, the form of the literary and art service group has been promoted throughout the province. The literary and art service group is a good form for literature and art to serve proletarian politics, production, and workers, peasants, and soldiers; it is also a good form for prospering literary and artistic creation, transforming and improving literary and art workers, and cultivating literary and art teams in a faster, better, and more economical way. The success of the literary and art service group is a major victory for Shandong's literary and art work under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.
    The primary task of the literary and art service group is to do a good job in political mobilization and closely serve production.
    The literary and art service group goes to the construction site, not to visit as guests, nor to do its own thing, but to work completely under the leadership of the construction site Party committee, and is a part of the construction site's political propaganda organization. Under the direct leadership of the construction site Party committee, the members of the literary and art service group go deep into the masses and into the production process as ordinary laborers, not only acting as good propagandists of the Party, but also training to become versatile "all-rounders." For example, the "Bisecting the Yellow River" Literary and Art Service Group carried 1,200 willow pillows in one collective labor. Many comrades, after performing, went on to participate in labor, and the migrant workers said with emotion: "The comrades of the service group perform and work, we should respond to them with greater effort!" Some comrades were rated as advanced workers by the construction site headquarters, and some were on the honor roll.
    The literary and art service group is actually the Party's propaganda team, and the personnel participating in the service group are all propaganda mobilizers. They understand that as a propagandist, they must first deeply understand the ideological trends of the migrant workers, and do a good job in propaganda mobilization in order to more effectively promote the progress of the project. After the service group arrived at the construction site, it immediately used various propaganda tools and forms. As many migrant workers reflected: the construction site is more lively than the New Year. This propaganda mobilization work greatly consolidated the migrant worker team and improved their labor enthusiasm. As a folk song circulating at the Weishan construction site sings: "The construction site is like a theater, working is like a battlefield, literary and art propaganda is good, and labor enthusiasm is strong." The comrades of the literary and art service group also pay attention to understanding the ideological trends of the masses at any time and carry out propaganda work. For example, in the early stage of construction at the Weishan construction site, a few migrant workers did not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of the Weishan Hub project and lacked enthusiasm. In response to the above situation, the service group cooperated with the entire political and ideological work of the construction site to launch propaganda activities, including a pile-driving song written with the assistance of migrant workers, which reads: "For agricultural leap forward, water conservancy must be realized. After building the barrage, we will build the dam, and after repairing the desilting gate, the river water will gurgle. Irrigating thousands of acres, the land will be terraced; cotton and grain will greatly increase, and the leap forward flowers will bloom. Water conservancy can generate electricity, rural areas will be urbanized; cars will run on the bridge, and boats will sail in the river. Under the dam is a fish pond, and on the dam is a garden; everyone is encouraged to work hard and repair the dam well." This folk song has educational significance for many migrant workers. They sang while working, facing the Weishan "bisecting the Yellow River" construction site, yearning for the socialist scenery, and their emotions were high and their enthusiasm soared.
    The slogan of "launching large-scale services" is particularly loud in the literary and art service group, and is particularly prominent in performing arts groups. No matter how cold the weather is or how deep the night is, "We will perform whenever the masses want to see it!" On the banks of the Yellow River, where the cold wind is blowing, and in the Yimeng Mountains, where the snow is flying, they brave the ice and snow and the cold wind to perform outdoors. The construction site is vast and the work areas are scattered, so the performance team "delivers the play to the door." During the intense construction phase, the migrant workers worked in two shifts, day and night, so the performance team held drama evenings in the first half of the night and sang for the migrant workers on the loudspeaker in the second half of the night until dawn. After watching the play, the migrant workers in the Yimeng Mountains happily sang: "Received education and awareness is high, right-leaning conservatism is completely rejected, learning enthusiasm is high and soaring, and labor enthusiasm is soaring into the clouds." During the red flag competition at the Weishan construction site, the service group launched a mass upsurge of writing, painting, performing, and singing about advanced figures. Everywhere on the construction site, you can hear clappers, songs, drums, and storytelling praising advanced figures and advanced deeds; in many construction site propaganda sheds, there are portraits of hero and model figures, comic strips, ballads, and big-character posters, and many figures who are making a big splash in the technical revolution and their achievements in technical reform are written into communications, reports, and put on "Hero Biographies," and are drawn into comic strips. These literary and artistic activities timely reflected the new people and new things on the construction site, improved the ideological awareness of the masses, and stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the migrant workers, thereby promoting the progress of the project. The service group directly created a new method of "drilling blast holes" with the migrant workers at Weishan, and used literary and artistic forms to publicize and promote this new method, which quickly spread throughout the entire construction site. The migrant workers in Buzhuangying, Changyi, heard that they were going to write "Hero Biographies" for them, and their enthusiasm was greatly improved. Under the inspiration of the heroes, heroes and advanced units such as "Iron Man," "Eight Great Vajras," "Liu Hulan Platoon," and "March 8th Company" further created high yields, driving the tens of thousands of migrant workers on the entire construction site.
    These facts show that if the literary and art service group wants to better serve the current proletarian politics, production, and the masses, it should closely cooperate with the Party's central task to do a good job in political propaganda, it must go to the production front line, go to the masses of workers and peasants, go deep into the fiery struggle, and use various literary and artistic forms to reflect this struggle and promote its development.
    The literary and art service group should earnestly do a good job in the guidance work of the construction site and develop mass literary and art teams.
    The literary and art service group should not only actively serve the construction site itself, but also mobilize more forces to serve the construction site. Therefore, it is necessary to do guidance work while serving, to take apprentices, and to cultivate new forces. The most effective way to solve this problem is to take the mass line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses to do literary and artistic work. Literature and art without a mass base is like grass without roots and water without a source, it has no vitality. Moreover, the service group is after all a temporary organization, and it cannot work on a construction site for a long time. If, after a literary and art service group leaves a construction site, the literary and art propaganda work there continues to develop vigorously, it proves that the work of this service group has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the masses; if, after a literary and art service group leaves a construction site, the literary and art propaganda work weakens, it proves that this service group has not yet completed its mission well. The comrades of the service group understood this point, so they realized that another important task of theirs was to guide the mass literary and artistic activities, to discover and cultivate the activists of literary and artistic activities among the masses, and with this strong mass base, the cultural life on the construction site will be colorful and lively.
    The professional guidance work of the literary and art service group first cultivates and trains a large number of backbones through transmission classes, training classes, etc., expands the literary and art team, and makes literature and art take root among the masses. In just over 20 days of serving in the Yimeng Mountains, more than 700 literary and artistic backbones were trained. Secondly, it focuses on processing mass creations. The most important thing in processing is to discuss and consult with the masses. The works that the literary and art service group helped the masses to process on the construction site not only spread quickly on the construction site, but also many works have been published in newspapers and periodicals. Finally, under the leadership of the Party, grassroots cultural organizations were established and improved. This is an important key to ensuring that literary and art work on the construction site can regularly carry out literary and artistic activities.
    Under the active guidance of the literary and art service group, the content and form of literary and artistic activities on the construction site, and the creation and singing of the masses have been significantly improved. On the one hand, by helping the masses to establish organizations, cultivate backbones, and guide creation to carry out singing activities, rehearse dramas, teach dance programs, and guide the masses to create scripts, folk songs, clappers, art, music, etc.; on the other hand, it also attaches importance to learning from amateur authors and folk artists among the masses, actively collecting folk songs, and excavating and sorting out traditional folk art heritages, so that the professional skills and artistic levels of professional literary and art authors have also been developed and improved.
    The activities of the literary and art service group have enriched the creative sources of writers and artists.
    In just a few months, the comrades of the literary and art service group created a large number of literary and artistic works, and more importantly, in the process of going deep into the construction site, going deep into the masses, and going deep into actual struggle, they improved their thinking, enriched their creative sources, and prepared favorable conditions for future creation.
    In practice, the literary and art service group deeply realized that to improve the combat effectiveness of works, it is necessary to first improve the mass character and ideological character of literary and artistic works. The content of the work needs to be closely combined with the central task and the ideological situation of the masses, so that it can directly encourage labor enthusiasm and promote production. The creators take materials on the spot, create on the spot, and spread on the spot. The form is small, diverse, popular, lively, easy to sing, and easy to spread. From the perspective of literary and artistic forms, the ones that have been widely used and played a greater role in several service groups are opera, quyi, art, as well as reports, communications, "Hero Biographies," and poems in literature, which have been warmly welcomed by the masses. Quyi showed a particularly strong combat role, and a small passage can be written in an hour or two, which is the most convenient form for taking materials on the spot, creating on the spot, and singing on the spot. Poetry is the most encouraging, very active on the construction site, can be recited, can be sung, can be used to write big-character posters, slogans, and make summary reports. Literary forms such as "Hero Biographies," communications, and reports have also played a great role, especially "Hero Biographies," which are worthy of the name and have a very good topic. The 70 "Hero Biographies" written by the service group at the Xiashan Reservoir have left a profound impact on the masses. Art, this form is also used a lot on the construction site, hero portraits, comic strips of model figures, and various propaganda paintings are very popular with migrant workers. The painters created many good paintings at the Weishan construction site. Other forms such as music, dance, documentary films, and short stories have also played a certain role.
    Due to the needs of the tense combat situation on the construction site, the works are required to be short, concise, and have immediate results. However, some larger works need to go through a longer process of understanding the situation, collecting materials, creating, and processing. For example, the creation of the large-scale Lu opera "Bisecting the Yellow River" was based on materials taken from the construction site and completed in the organ. The creation of the service group should generally focus on small, combat-effective works, but the preparation work for large works must never be excluded.
    The important reason for the achievements of the literary and art service group in creation is that the authors truly and steadily went deep into the masses, ate, lived, and worked with the masses, and were seamlessly integrated. For example, before interviewing and writing materials, the youth group of Qufu Normal College carried stones and hugged wind drills in mountain caves and tunnels. Under extremely difficult conditions, they participated in heavy labor, not afraid of tiredness or hardship, and did whatever work they could find, and got very close to the masses. They wanted to write about several model cadres, but because these cadres were active in various work sections day and night, they could not be found, so they carried steamed buns and followed them to work, and took notes for them at meetings, and as a result, they collected a lot of rich materials. Many painters, composers, poets, playwrights, and quyi artists have created various forms of works because they have gone deep into the masses and have become one with the masses.
    The creative practice of the literary and art service group proves that the Party must strengthen the leadership of literary and art work, and writers must go deep into the masses and combine with the masses under the leadership of the Party in order to write good works. The construction sites where the literary and art service group went are all places where the Party's leadership is strong, heroic figures are concentrated, and there are many active literary and art activists among the masses, plus the professional strength of the literary and art service group, which creates favorable conditions for the production of excellent literary and artistic works. In the process of creation, from determining the characters, analyzing the materials, conducting in-depth interviews, to revising the works, the service group received the support of the construction site Party committee and the masses, and the leaders of the provincial Party committee also specifically guided the creation of the service group. Therefore, although the time was short, it was able to create works of higher quality. For example, through the rehearsal of the drama "Yellow River Bell" on the construction site, comrades Shu Tong and Liu Jiping of the Provincial Party Committee pointed out a series of important principles on how literature and art should express the times, how to express the leadership of the Party, and how to shape heroic figures; through the test screening of the large-scale documentary film "Bisecting the Yellow River," many major problems were also pointed out. These instructions played a great role in the creation of the service group. Under the direct leadership of the provincial Party committee, a batch of better works were continuously created.
    The process of the literary and art service group going deep into the construction site to serve is a process of combining theory with practice, and it is also a process of transforming the world outlook.
    After the literary and art service group went deep into the construction site, it adhered to the study of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought from beginning to end, adhered to the principle of combining theory with practice, and thus achieved significant improvement in thinking. After studying "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art," the Shandong Peking Opera Troupe saw the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, and many actors said excitedly: "Chairman Mao is right in the document, who else should our literature and art serve if not these people?" Some students from Shandong University thought when they first visited the Xiashan Reservoir: "Heroic figures are just pushing a few more carts of soil, there is nothing to learn, and it will be monotonous to write about." But after studying "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art," they reviewed their work and realized that the main reason was that they had not gone deep into the masses, they were not familiar with heroic figures, they did not love heroic figures, let alone make close friends with them. Therefore, they immediately went deep down, became one with the migrant workers, and quickly became friends with each other, so they understood the thoughts, feelings, and character characteristics of the heroic figures.
    Going deep into the masses, going deep into reality, learning from the masses, and learning from reality are the most important ways for intellectuals to transform their thinking. The comrades of the service group saw with their own eyes in Weishan that the dam project of "bisecting the Yellow River" was a miracle in the world using indigenous methods, and it was successfully completed in just 14 days, thus deepening their understanding that this was the spirit of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and it was the product of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune, and thus received endless encouragement and strength. In the process of going deep into life and visiting heroic figures, the spirit of selfless labor and the noble communist ideological qualities of the heroes gave everyone a great education. They regarded these heroic figures as their learning models. A professor from Shandong University saw the high morale and soaring enthusiasm of the migrant workers and said: "Everything is boiling, everything is full of heroism. My conservative thinking has been severely hit here." An author visited a commune Party secretary, and after many talks, the comrade attributed the achievements to the Party and the masses, and never mentioned the word "I." He was greatly moved and criticized his individualism. Everywhere on the construction site, there appeared a communist style of vying for the first place, disregarding wind and rain, not counting rewards, not talking about conditions, going wherever people are needed, and going wherever there are difficulties, which moved and educated every literary and art worker. Some comrades said: "When I was in the organ, I thought my enthusiasm was very strong and my style was very high, but compared with the migrant workers, I felt very ashamed, far behind. We must learn from the masses!" Everyone personally experienced that going to the scene, going to labor, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and learning from production practice are the most effective methods to promote the ideological transformation of literary and art workers and intellectuals, and it is also the best way to combine mental labor with physical labor.
    The composition of the literary and art service group is mainly to serve the construction site front line, but it also has the task of further rectification in actual struggle. On the basis of studying the instructions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, we will take practical actions to further oppose right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, overcome the ideological style of divorcing from reality and divorcing from the masses, and establish the view of wholeheartedly serving politics, production, and central work. The activities of several service groups have greatly improved the work style of the leading organs and overcome the shortcomings of divorcing from the masses; for the schools, they have closely combined construction site service, on-site creation, and teaching reform, and overcome the tendency of teaching to divorce from labor and divorce from reality; the writers have greatly enriched their creative sources and written many valuable works. In short, all the personnel of the literary and art service group received a profound education in the working masses and actual struggle, enriched their perceptual knowledge, improved their creative ability, and promoted the change of their world outlook. This was a combat action, and it was also the most practical and profound rectification.
    Here, we have a most fundamental experience, that is: the achievement of the literary and art service group is due to the result of putting politics in command and the Party's leadership. On the basis of the literary and art rectification, the Shandong literary and art workers further earnestly studied Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the Party's instructions on literary and art work, and resolutely implemented the intentions of the provincial Party committee. Every achievement of the literary and art service group is inseparable from the concern and direct leadership of the provincial Party committee. The provincial Party committee is very concerned about literary and art work, and the literary and art workers also seriously listen to the Party's words, which is the fundamental guarantee for the success of the literary and art service group. Of course, because we have not done enough, the achievements we have made are still preliminary, and the experience is still superficial, and we still need to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to move forward. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only, broadest, and richest source..." Comrade Mao Zedong also told us: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics." At present, the biggest politics in our country is to resolutely oppose imperialism, especially US imperialism and its accomplices of modern revisionism, that is, to go all out, aim high, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, that is, to most fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people and quickly change our country's backwardness of "poverty and blankness," and build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern scientific culture, and modern national defense. Our literary and art service group is precisely starting from this greatest political struggle, closely cooperating with the large-scale water conservancy construction movement led by the Party, thereby promoting the development of this great revolutionary mass movement.

专栏：

    我国的文学艺术工作者必须继续按照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到这个唯一的最广大最丰富的创作源泉中去，热情地歌颂新的事物和新的英雄人物，表现革命的新生事物对阻碍革命前进的旧事物的斗争，来为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业服务。
    ——陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院向中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会的祝词
    文艺工作者到生产第一线去
    中共山东省委宣传部长　王众音
    去冬今春，中共山东省委为了贯彻执行中央大办水利的指示，动员了一千多万劳动力上水利前线，兴办了许多大、中型水库工程和渠道、堤坝、桥梁、涵洞。其中最大而最重要的是“腰斩黄河”的位山枢纽工程。这些水利工程完成以后，可以灌溉全省70％的农田，而且为战胜特大旱涝灾害、保证农业生产不断丰收创造极有利的条件。这是一个伟大而艰巨的兴利除弊的壮举，是山东人民又一次地对大自然的宣战。
    形势和任务，向我们政治工作、宣传鼓动工作者提出了这样一个光荣而紧迫的任务：加强水利战线上的政治思想工作，坚决保证生产任务的完成。因此，中共山东省委向全省文艺工作者发出了战斗号召：组织文艺服务团到工地去，到生产第一线去，到工农兵群众中去，去作宣传鼓动工作，去表演、歌唱、写作，去锻炼自己，去提高自己。于是，山东省“腰斩黄河”文艺服务团组织起来了；“腰斩沂河”、“腰斩潍河”……的文艺服务团开赴前线了；其间又组织了工业、农业、妇女、民兵、文教等五次群英大会的文艺服务团。参加服务团的有文艺部门的负责人、作家、艺术家、各种文艺工作者，以及一部分大专院校师生，共约一千五百余人，创作出各种形式的文学作品七十余万字，各种形式的美术作品五千余件，搜集民歌两千余首；为群众演出一百八十余场，观众约三十三万人次。
    现在，文艺服务团的形式，已经在全省范围内推广。文艺服务团是文艺为无产阶级政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的一种良好的形式；也是繁荣文艺创作，改造提高文艺工作者，多快好省地培养文艺队伍的一种良好形式。文艺服务团的成功，是山东文艺工作在毛泽东文艺思想指导下的重大胜利。
    文艺服务团的首要任务是做好政治鼓动工作，密切为生产服务。
    文艺服务团上工地，不是参观作客，也不是自搞一套，而是完全在工地党委的领导下进行工作，是工地政治宣传组织的一部分。在工地党委的直接领导下，文艺服务团团员都是以一个普通劳动者的身份深入群众，深入生产过程，既要当好党的宣传员，又要锻炼成为一专多能的“多面手”。例如“腰斩黄河”文艺服务团在一次集体劳动中就抬柳枕一千二百条。许多同志在演出之后，接着又参加劳动，民工们感动地说：“服务团的同志又演戏又干活，我们应当用更大的劲头来回答他们！”有些同志被工地指挥部评为先进工作者，有的上了光荣榜。
    文艺服务团实际上是党的宣传队，参加服务团的人员，都是宣传鼓动员。他们了解，做为一个宣传员首先就要深入了解民工的思想动态，作好宣传鼓动工作，才能更有力地推动工程前进。服务团到了工地以后，立即将各种宣传工具、宣传形式都运用起来。就像许多民工反映的：工地上比过年还热闹。这种宣传鼓动工作，大大地巩固了民工队伍和提高了他们的劳动积极性。正如位山工地传颂的一首民歌所歌唱的：“工地像戏院，干活比战场，文艺宣传好，劳动劲头强。”文艺服务团同志还随时注意了解群众的思想动态，进行宣传工作。例如位山工地施工初期，少数民工对位山枢纽工程的重大意义认识不足，干劲不大。服务团针对上述情况，配合工地整个政治思想工作，展开了宣传活动，其中辅导民工编唱的一首打夯歌写道：“农业大跃进，必须水利化。建了拦河闸，又修拦河坝，修好冲沙闸，河水白哗哗。浇地千万亩，大地畦田化；棉粮大增产，盛开跃进花。水利能发电，农村城市化；桥上跑汽车，河里把船划。堤下是鱼池，堤上园林化；大家鼓干劲，修好拦河坝”。这首民歌对许多民工都有着教育意义。他们一面劳动一面歌唱，面对着腰斩黄河工地，向往着社会主义美景，情绪高昂，干劲冲天。
    “开展大服务”的口号在文艺服务团叫得特别响亮，在表演艺术团体尤为突出。不管天多么冷，夜多么深，“什么时候群众要看，我们就什么时候演！”在寒风凛冽的黄河之滨，在大雪纷飞的沂蒙山区，他们冒着冰雪，顶着寒风，作露天演出。工地辽阔，工区分散，演出组就“送戏上门”。在施工紧张阶段，民工分昼夜两班工作，演出组就上半夜举行戏剧晚会，下半夜在扩音器上为民工演唱，直到天明。沂蒙山区的民工看了戏后，高兴地唱道：“受了教育觉悟高，右倾保守全反掉，学习热情高万丈，劳动干劲冲云霄”。位山工地在红旗竞赛运动中，服务团掀起了一个群众性的大写、大画、大演、大唱先进人物的高潮。在工地上到处可以听到表扬先进人物、先进事迹的快板、歌曲、大鼓、快书；在许多工地宣传棚里张贴着英雄模范人物的画像、连环画、歌谣和大字报，许多大闹技术革命的人物和他们在技术改革方面的成就，被写成通讯、报告，上了“英雄传”，被画成连环画。这些文艺活动及时地反映了工地上的新人新事，提高了群众的思想觉悟，激发了民工的劳动积极性，从而推动了工程前进。服务团在位山直接与民工一起创造了“凿炮眼”的新方法，又运用文艺形式宣传推广了这种新方法，于是很快传遍了全工地。昌邑卜庄营的民工听说要给他们写“英雄传”，干劲都提高了。在英雄们的鼓舞下，“铁人”、“八大金刚”、“刘胡兰排”、“三八连”等英雄人物和先进单位，都进一步创了高产，带动了整个工地上的数万民工。
    这些事实说明了文艺服务团要更好地为当前的无产阶级政治、为生产、为群众服务，就应当紧紧配合党的中心任务做好政治宣传工作，必须到生产前线，到工农群众中去，深入火热的斗争，并且运用各种文艺形式反映这个斗争，推动它向前发展。
    文艺服务团应该认真地做好工地的辅导工作，发展群众性的文艺队伍。
    文艺服务团不但自己要积极为工地服务，而且要动员更多的力量为工地服务。因此，需要边服务边做辅导工作，要带徒弟，要培养新生力量。解决这个问题最有效的办法，就是走群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众做文艺工作。没有群众基础的文艺，就像无根之草、无源之水一样，是没有生命力的。况且服务团毕竟是一个临时性的组织，它不可能在一个工地长期工作。如果一个文艺服务团离开工地以后，那里的文艺宣传工作仍然蓬勃发展下去，那就证明这个服务团的工作已经在群众中生根、开花、结果了；如果一个工地在文艺服务团走了以后，文艺宣传工作减弱了，那就证明这个服务团还没有很好地完成它的使命。服务团的同志们都理解了这一点，因此他们认识到自己的另一个重要任务就是要作辅导群众文艺活动的工作，要去发现、培养群众中的文艺活动的积极分子，有了这个雄厚的群众基础，工地上的文化生活才会有声有色地活跃起来。
    文艺服务团的专业辅导工作，首先是通过传授班、训练班等方式，培养训练大批骨干，扩大了文艺队伍，使文艺在群众中生根。仅在沂蒙山区服务的二十多天中就训练了文艺骨干分子七百多人。其次是对群众创作进行重点加工。加工当中最重要的一条是和群众一起讨论、商量。文艺服务团在工地帮助群众加工的作品，不仅都很快地在工地传播开来，而且有许多作品已在报刊上发表了。最后是在党的领导下，建立和健全了基层的文化组织。这是保证工地文艺工作能经常地开展文艺活动的重要关键。
    在文艺服务团的积极辅导之下，工地文艺活动的内容和形式、群众的创作和演唱都有显著提高。一方面通过帮助群众建立组织，培养骨干，指导创作去开展歌咏活动，排演戏剧，传授舞蹈节目，以及辅导群众创作剧本、民歌、快板、美术、音乐等作品；另一方面，又重视向群众业余作者和民间艺人学习，积极搜集民歌、挖掘整理传统的民间艺术遗产，从而使专业文艺作者的业务能力和艺术水平也获得了发展和提高。
    文艺服务团的活动，丰富了作家、艺术家的创作源泉。
    在短短的几个月中，文艺服务团的同志们创作了大量的文学艺术作品，而更重要的是他们在深入工地、深入群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，提高了思想，丰富了创作源泉，为今后创作准备了有利的条件。
    文艺服务团在实践中，深切地体会到，要提高作品的战斗性，首先就要提高文艺作品的群众性和思想性。作品内容需要紧紧结合中心任务和群众的思想情况，这样就能直接鼓舞劳动热情，推动生产。创作人员就地取材，就地创作，就地传播。形式小型、多样，通俗、活泼，便于演唱，容易流传。从文艺形式来看，几次服务团运用的较广泛、发挥作用较大的是戏曲、曲艺、美术以及文学中的报告、通讯、“英雄传”、诗歌等，这些都受到群众的热烈欢迎。曲艺显示了特别强烈的战斗作用，个把钟头就可以写个小段子，这是一种就地取材、就地创作、就地演唱的最方便的形式。诗歌最富有鼓动性，在工地上很活跃，可以朗诵，可以歌唱，写大字报、标语，提口号、作总结报告都用得着它。“英雄传”、通讯、报告等文学形式，也发挥了很大的作用，特别是“英雄传”，名副其实，题目很好。服务团在峡山水库写的七十篇“英雄传”，在群众中留下了深远的影响。美术，这一形式在工地上运用的也很多，英雄画像、模范人物连环画，以及各种各样的宣传画，很受民工欢迎。画家们在位山工地创作了不少好画。其他如音乐、舞蹈、纪录影片、短篇小说等形式也都发挥了一定的作用。
    由于工地紧张战斗情况的需要，要求作品短小精悍，立竿见影。但是，有些较大的作品要经过一个较长时间的了解情况，搜集材料，创作和加工的过程。例如大型鲁剧《腰斩黄河》的创作，就是在工地取材而在回到机关中完稿的。服务团的创作，一般应以小型的战斗性强的作品为主，但绝不能排斥大作品的酝酿准备工作。
    文艺服务团在创作方面获得成就，很重要的原因就是作者真正扎扎实实地深入到群众中去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，融洽无间。例如，曲阜师范学院青年组，在采访写作材料之前，他们在山洞隧道中抬石头，抱风钻，在极艰苦的条件下，参加沉重的劳动，不怕累，不怕苦，见活就干，和群众搞得很亲热。他们要写几个模范干部，由于这几个干部日日夜夜都在各工段活动，找不到，于是他们就背上窝窝头，跟着他们一起劳动，开会给他们当记录，结果搜集到了很丰富的材料。不少画家、作曲家、诗人、剧作家和曲艺家们，都由于深入群众和群众打成一片而创作出了各种形式的作品。
    文艺服务团的创作实践证明，党必须加强对文艺工作的领导，作家必须在党的领导下深入群众，和群众相结合，才能写出好作品来。文艺服务团所到的工地，都是党的领导力量强，英雄人物集中，群众文艺积极分子多的地方，再加上文艺服务团的专业力量，这就具备了产生优秀的文艺作品的有利条件。服务团在进行创作中，从确定人物，分析材料，深入采访，到修改作品，都得到工地党委和群众的支持，而且省委领导同志还具体指导服务团的创作。因而，时间虽短，却能创作出具有较高质量的作品。例如，在工地上通过对戏剧《黄河钟声》的彩排，省委舒同、刘季平等同志指出了文艺如何表现时代，如何表现党的领导，如何塑造英雄人物等一系列重要的原则问题；通过对《腰斩黄河》大型纪录片的试映，也指出了许多重大问题。这些指示对服务团的创作起了很大的作用。在省委直接领导下，连续地创作出一批较好的作品。
    文艺服务团深入工地服务的过程，是理论与实践相结合的过程，也是一个改造世界观的过程。
    文艺服务团深入工地后，自始至终坚持了毛泽东文艺思想的学习，坚持了理论与实践相结合的方针，因而在思想上获得了显著的提高。山东省京剧一团在工地学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以后，看到了群众的冲天干劲，许多演员都激动地说：“毛主席在文件里说的太对了，我们的文艺不为这些人服务，还要为谁服务呢？”山东大学的一部分同学，在峡山水库开始访问时认为：“英雄人物都不过是多推了几车子土，没有什么可学的，写起来也会千篇一律。”但通过《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的学习后，联系自己的工作进行了检查，认识到主要还是没有深入到群众中去，对英雄人物还不熟悉，还不热爱英雄人物，更说不上和他们交知心朋友。于是，他们立即深入下去，和民工们打成一片，彼此很快地交成了朋友，因而也就了解了英雄人物的思想感情和性格特点。
    深入群众，深入实际，向群众学习，向实际学习，这是知识分子改造思想最重要的办法。服务团的同志在位山，亲眼看到用土办法“腰斩黄河”这一举世奇迹的拦河大坝工程，在短短十四天内就顺利完成了，因而更加深切地认识到这是发扬了党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的精神，是大跃进、人民公社化的产物，从而得到了无穷的鼓舞和力量。在深入生活和访问英雄人物的过程中，英雄们的忘我劳动的精神和高尚的共产主义思想品质，给大家很大教育。他们把这些英雄人物当作自己的学习榜样。山东大学一位教授看到了民工们志气昂扬，干劲冲天，说道：“一切在沸腾，一切充满英雄气概。我的保守思想在这里受到了沉重的打击。”有个作者访问一个公社党委书记，经过多次谈话，那位同志都把成绩归功于党和群众，从未讲过一个“我”字，他大受感动，批判了自己的个人主义思想。工地上到处都出现争先恐后、不顾风雨、不计报酬、不讲条件、哪里要人就到哪里去、哪里困难就到哪里去的共产主义风格，感动和教育了每个文艺工作者。有的同志说：“在机关时认为自己的干劲很足，风格挺高，但和民工们一比，就觉得很惭愧，差得太远了。一定要向群众学习！”大家亲身体会到：到现场去，到劳动中去，向工农群众学习，向生产实际学习，这是推动文艺工作者、推动知识分子进行思想改造的最有效的方法，也是脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的最好方法。
    文艺服务团的组成，最主要的是为工地前线服务，但它同时也有在实际斗争中进一步整风的任务。在学习党的八中全会指示的基础上，以实际行动来进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，克服脱离实际脱离群众的思想作风，树立全心全意为政治、为生产、为中心工作服务的观点。几次服务团的活动，对领导机关来说，都大大改进了工作作风，克服了脱离群众的毛病；对学校来说，把工地服务、就地创作与教学改革紧密结合，克服了教学中脱离劳动、脱离实际的倾向；作家们则大大丰富了创作源泉，写出了许多有价值的作品。总之，文艺服务团的所有人员都在劳动群众和实际斗争中受到了一次深刻的教育，丰富了自己的感性知识，提高了自己的创作能力，促进了自己的世界观的变化。这是一次战斗的行动，也是一次最实际、最深刻的整风。
    这里，我们有一条最根本的体会就是：文艺服务团成就的取得，乃是由于政治挂帅、党的领导的结果。山东文艺工作者在文艺整风的基础上，进一步认真地学习了毛泽东文艺思想和党的有关文艺工作的指示，坚决地贯彻执行了省委的意图。文艺服务团的每一个成果，都是同省委的关心和直接领导分不开的。省委非常关心文艺工作，文艺工作者也认真地听党的话，这就是文艺服务团成功的根本保证。当然，由于我们做得还很不够，因而所取得的成就还是初步的，经验也还是粗浅的，今后还需要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，继续前进。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去……。”毛泽东同志又告诉我们：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治”。当前我国最大的政治就是要坚决反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义，就是要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，也就是要最充分地调动人民群众的革命积极性，迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的落后面貌，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国。我们的文艺服务团正是从这个最大的政治斗争出发，紧密地配合了党所领导的大规模水利建设运动，从而促进了这个伟大的革命群众运动的发展。
