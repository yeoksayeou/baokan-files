Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 12th: Leading cadres in Sichuan are going deep into the front lines, concentrating superior forces, and vigorously grasping the field management of major spring crops, striving for an overall bumper harvest in the autumn.

The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee has listed vigorously grasping field management as one of the central tasks for July, instructing all localities to immediately launch a field management campaign centered on accumulating and producing fertilizer, while continuing to rush-plant sweet potatoes and expand the area of late rice. It also requires all localities to ensure that 70%-80% of the labor force is concentrated on the front lines of agricultural production.

According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, after the planting tasks were basically completed, the Jiangjin Special District immediately launched a nationwide field management blitz week, established field management command structures at all levels, with the secretary of the Party Committee taking the lead and committee members contracting specific areas. In the Wenjiang Special District, more than 100,000 cadres from the five levels of the Special District to the Commune Management District have joined forces in the fields, using more than 70% of the labor force for the field management of rice, which has the largest sown area, and established a strict responsibility system to ensure that each paddy field has a dedicated person responsible for continuous field management. By the beginning of July, the entire district had completed the second weeding and topdressing tasks for rice. In its field management work, the Nanchong Special District simultaneously grasped staple grains, miscellaneous grains, coarse grains, fine grains, regular planting, and increased planting, striving to increase the production of every grain crop. While managing regular crops well, Wusheng County adopted a combination of collective management and dedicated management to strengthen the management of various small miscellaneous grains and increased planting crops such as melons and beans.

Sichuan Province is rich in economic crops, many of which are important industrial raw materials. While vigorously grasping grain production, Party committees at all levels have paid attention to ensuring the manpower and material resources needed for the production of economic crops. In the Neijiang Special District, a major economic crop producing area in Sichuan, the secretaries of Party committees at all levels are stationed in the fields, leading the masses in overall planning and comprehensive arrangements according to the principle of "ensuring key points (grain crops), highlighting characteristics (economic crops)," both seizing grain crops and not relaxing field management of economic crops. Their approach is to establish fixed field management professional teams for major economic crops such as cotton, sugarcane, and peanuts. Fertilizers are also dedicated to specific uses.

In order to ensure the fertilizers needed for various crops in the field management stage, all localities have launched a campaign to accumulate high-quality manure and produce soil-based fertilizers on a large scale. Taking advantage of the lush summer vegetation, the Daxian Special District has accumulated and produced more than 23 billion catties of various natural fertilizers in the past twenty days or so.

All localities are also vigorously creating and promoting new field management tools.

Xinhua News Agency: The agricultural production situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is unprecedentedly good, and the broad masses of commune members are highly enthusiastic in production. Spring plowing and sowing were carried out early, quickly, extensively, and well, and a field management campaign centered on summer hoeing has fully formed a high tide. The region's sowing plan for this year has been overfulfilled.

Managing immediately after sowing is a very significant feature of agricultural production in Inner Mongolia this year. In order to achieve advanced production increase targets, all localities ensured the quality of sowing during sowing, and vigorously grasped field management centered on summer hoeing after sowing, while also waging a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as drought, floods, diseases, and insect pests. At present, the labor force engaged in field management in the region accounts for 74.8% of the total rural labor force. Party and government leading organs and people's communes at all levels have also transferred more than 100,000 cadres to support summer hoeing, greatly accelerating the progress of hoeing. The area that has been hoeed once accounts for 69% of the sown area, more than 1.3 million mu more than the same period last year, of which the area that has been hoeed twice accounts for more than 30% of the sown area. In conjunction with summer hoeing, all localities have also actively carried out topdressing and watering. Compared with the same period last year, topdressing has increased by 2.5 million mu and watering has increased by 3.62 million mu.

Recently, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee required all localities to focus on the following tasks: First, further strengthen field management, organize campaigns, launch a blitz on summer hoeing, complete the first hoeing before the beginning of the first fu (the hottest period of summer), and seize the time to rush-hoe the second and third times. Second, seize the opportunity to rush-plant as much as possible. All land that can be planted should be planted, and late-season crops should be planted as much as possible, autumn vegetables should be planted on a large scale, and intercropping and relay cropping should be vigorously promoted in areas where conditions permit. Third, give full play to the benefits of water conservancy and vigorously carry out drought prevention and resistance. Emphasize water conservation, overall interests, consideration for both upstream and downstream areas, and the spirit of the whole country acting as one, making full use of existing canals and reservoirs to maximize their benefits. Inspect irrigation and drainage machinery, and promptly return borrowed machinery and arrange for proper matching. Give full play to the drought resistance power of underground water sources. Withdraw labor from water conservancy projects that cannot be closed before the flood season and quickly invest them in the current drought resistance and field management campaign. Fourth, seize the great opportunity to vigorously carry out manure accumulation, composting, and fertilizer production movements, launch a blitz on green manure composting, and expand fertilizer sources. Vigorously grasp topdressing work, in addition to topdressing with farmyard manure, also topdress with some chemical and soil-based fertilizers. Fifth, do a good job in flood prevention, drainage, and pest and disease control. First of all, we must indeed do a good job in flood prevention for large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects, strictly check dangerous works and hidden dangers, raise and thicken them, and make various preparations for flood prevention and emergency rescue in terms of manpower, material resources, and organization. Sixth, do a good job in preparing for the summer harvest and clearing fallow land, start early, harvest in a timely manner, pull and thresh in a timely manner, and strive to ensure that all grains are stored in granaries to avoid losses and waste.

Xinhua News Agency: The people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai are doing a solid, in-depth, and meticulous job in the field management of rice and cotton, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn-ripening crops this year.

The quality of rice and cotton sowing in the suburbs of Shanghai this year is relatively high, and the growth is good. At present, early rice has already reached the heading and flowering stage, mid-season rice is tillering and jointing, late rice that was planted early has entered the peak tillering period, and some have begun to develop, while late rice that was planted late has also begun to tiller. Cotton is growing vigorously, and early-planted cotton has begun to bud. All counties and communes are seizing this critical period of field management and have launched a field management upsurge. Many cadres from county-level agencies in Songjiang County have gone deep into the front lines of production to participate in production and lead production. The county hoeed more than 100,000 mu of late rice fields in one week. In Fengxian County, 60,000 commune members have been mobilized in recent days to cultivate, weed, and thin cotton fields. The county's 287,000 mu of cotton have completed the first cultivation and weeding, and some cotton fields have been cultivated two or three times continuously.

In order to reduce the labor intensity of commune members and accelerate the progress of field management, the communes have also adopted some new tools. (Attached picture)

　　四川内蒙古集中主要力量管理秋田
　　上海郊区各县深入细致管理水稻棉花
    据新华社成都12日电　四川各地领导干部深入第一线，集中优势力量，狠抓大春作物田间管理，力争秋季全面大丰收。
    中共四川省委已把狠抓田间管理列为7月份的中心工作之一，指示各地在继续抢种甘薯和扩大晚稻面积的同时，立即开展以积肥造肥为中心的田间管理运动。并要求各地必须保证把70％—80％的劳动力集中到农业生产第一线。
    根据省委的指示，江津专区在栽种任务基本完成后，立即开展了全民性的田间管理突击运动周，层层建立田间管理指挥机构，各级党委书记挂帅，委员分片包干。温江专区从专区到公社管理区五级的十万多名干部已会师田间，把70％以上劳动力用于播种面积最大的水稻田间管理上，并建立了严格的责任制度，做到每一块稻田都有专人负责，不间断地进行田间管理。到7月初，全区水稻已完成第二次薅秧和追肥任务。南充专区在田间管理工作中，把主粮、杂粮、粗粮、细粮、正种、增种一齐抓，力争项项粮食作物都增产。武胜县在管好正种作物的同时，采取了集体管理与专人管理相结合的办法，加强对各种小宗杂粮和瓜、豆等增种作物的管理。
    四川省经济作物丰富多采，许多都是重要的工业原料。各级党委在狠抓粮食生产的同时，都注意保证经济作物生产所需的人力和物力。四川主要经济作物产区的内江专区，各级党委书记都驻守田间，根据“保证重点（粮食作物）、突出特点（经济作物）”的原则，领导群众统筹兼顾，全面安排，既抓紧了粮食作物，又不放松经济作物的田间管理。他们采取的办法是：对棉花、甘蔗、花生等大宗经济作物，建立固定的田间管理专业队。肥料也实行专肥专用。
    为了保证各种作物在田间管理阶段所需要的肥料，各地都开展了大积精肥、大造土化肥的运动。达县专区抓紧夏季草木繁茂的时机，在最近二十多天内就积造各种自然肥料二百三十多亿斤。
    各地还大力创制和推广新的田间管理工具。
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区农业生产形势空前良好，广大社员生产积极性很高，春耕播种进行得又早、又快、又多、又好，以夏锄为中心的田间管理运动已经全面形成高潮。全区今年的播种计划超额完成。
    种下去就管，是今年内蒙古农业生产上很显著的一个特点。各地为了实现先进的增产指标，在播种时保证了播种质量，播种后又狠抓以夏锄为中心的田间管理，同时和旱、涝、病、虫等自然灾害展开了顽强的斗争。目前，全区投入田间管理的劳动力占农村总劳动力的74.8％，各级党政领导机关和人民公社还抽调了十多万名干部支援了夏锄，锄地进度大大加快。现已锄过头遍的地占播种面积的69％，比去年同期多了一百三十多万亩，其中锄过二遍的占播种面积的30％多。结合夏锄，各地还积极进行了追肥、浇水，和去年同期比较，追肥增加了二百五十万亩，浇水增加了三百六十二万亩。
    最近内蒙古党委要求各地抓好以下几项工作：第一，进一步加强田间管理，组织战役，突击夏锄，在头伏前锄完头遍地，并抓紧抢锄二、三遍。第二，抓紧时机，突击抢种，力争多种。凡能种的地都要全部种上，尽量多种晚田，大种秋菜，在有条件的地区大力推行复种、套种。第三，充分发挥水利效益，大力进行防旱抗旱。强调节约用水、顾全大局、上下游兼顾和全国一盘棋的精神，把现有的渠库全部利用起来，充分发挥效益。对排灌机械进行检查，借用的要迅速归队安排配套。发挥地下水源的抗旱威力。从汛前不能合龙的水利工程上把劳动力撤下来，迅速投入当前的抗旱和田间管理运动。第四，抓住大好时机，大力开展积肥、沤肥和造肥运动，突击沤制绿肥，扩大肥源。大抓追肥工作，除追农家肥外，还要追一些化肥和土化肥。第五，作好防汛防涝和防治病虫害等工作。首先是确实作好大中小型水利工程的防汛工作，严格检查险工和隐患，加高培厚，并从人力、物力和组织方面作好防汛和抢险的各种准备工作。第六，作好夏收准备和压伏荒工作，及早动手，适时收割，适时拉打，力争颗粒归仓，避免损失浪费。
    据新华社讯　上海郊区各人民公社踏踏实实、深入细致地抓好水稻、棉花田间管理，力争今年秋熟作物丰收。
    今年上海郊区的水稻、棉花播种质量比较高，生长情况良好。目前早稻已经孕穗抽穗，中稻正在分蘖拔节，晚稻种得早的已进入分蘖盛期，有的已开始发棵，种得晚的也开始分蘖。棉花长得茁壮，早种的已开始现蕾。各县、公社都紧紧抓住田间管理的这个关键性时期，掀起了田间管理热潮。松江县县级机关许多干部都深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。全县在一星期内就耘好十万多亩晚稻田。奉贤县连日来出动六万社员，为棉田中耕除草和间苗，全县二十八万七千多亩棉花已完成第一次中耕除草，部分棉田并已连续中耕两三次。
    为了减轻社员劳动强度和加快田间管理进度，各公社还采用了一些新工具。（附图片）
