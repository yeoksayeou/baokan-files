    South Vietnamese People Angrily Burn "Agrovilles"
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 28th: According to local newspapers, the South Vietnamese people, who were forcibly concentrated into the so-called "agrovilles" by the U.S.-Ngo clique and unable to endure the dark and hopeless life, have set fire to these disguised concentration camps and fled home.
    According to reports, in April of this year, the U.S.-Ngo clique dispatched troops and "security forces" to repeatedly conduct "sweeps" in Dong Thap Muoi in Kien Tuong province, driving the people of Phuoc Hau and Thinh Hoa villages into the "Kinh Te Agrovilles" and "Tan Lap Agrovilles". The South Vietnamese people concentrated here were subjected to strict surveillance. The "agrovilles" were surrounded by barbed wire, and people could only enter and exit through a small gate at specified times.
    The people who were driven into these two "agrovilles" launched many struggles against the Ngo Dinh Diem ruling group, demanding the freedom to move around and take care of their crops. On June 7, they could no longer endure this inhuman life and angrily set fire to the "agrovilles", destroyed the outposts, shouted "Down with the agrovilles," and escaped.
    According to reports, the "Man Da Agrovilles" in the Dong Thap Muoi area were also burned down by the masses on March 28th of this year. Ngo Dinh Diem's soldiers were terrified in the face of the surging mass struggle and surrendered to the people, while some were scared away. On the evening of April 4, the "Ba Thay Agrovilles" in An Giang province were also set on fire by the masses.

    用坚决斗争反对美吴集团的罪恶政策
    越南南方人民怒烧“稠密区”
    新华社河内28日电　据此间报纸报道，被美吴集团强迫集中到所谓“稠密区”的越南南方人民，由于无法忍受暗无天日的生活，纷纷放火烧毁这种变相的集中营，逃回家去。
    据报道，今年4月间，美吴集团出动军队和“保安团”在建祥省同塔梅反复地进行“扫荡”，把丰富和盛和两乡人民赶进“经则稠密区”和“新设稠密区”。被集中到这里的越南南方人民受到严密的监视。“稠密区”四周都围着铁丝网，人们只能在规定的时间经过一个小门出入。
    被赶进这两个“稠密区”的人民向吴庭艳统治集团展开了多次斗争，要求自由来往，照顾庄稼。6月7日，他们再也无法忍受这种非人的生活，愤怒地放火烧毁了“稠密区”，捣毁了岗哨，高呼“打倒稠密区”，逃脱出去。
    据报道，同塔梅地区的“曼大稠密区”也在今年3月28日被群众烧毁了。吴庭艳集团的士兵在汹涌澎湃的群众斗争面前恐慌万分，纷纷向人民投降，有的被吓跑了。4月4日晚上，安江省“巴替稠密区”也被群众放火烧毁。
