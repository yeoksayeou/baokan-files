    Salute to the Valiant Congolese Brothers!
　　Qian Junrui
    You fight well, fight resolutely and bravely, valiant Congolese brothers!
    Those riding on your heads, defecating and urinating, sucking your blood to the bone, are a small imperialism of today—a small group of Belgian colonialists. But as long as it is imperialism, regardless of its size, whether it is a lion, a tiger, or a wolf, its nature will never change: it devours people, and it always resorts to force first. Isn't that so? As soon as you stand up to defend your rights to independence and survival, their paratroopers, planes, and cannons come to wash your towns with blood, massacre your compatriots, and defend their so-called "civilization."
      "We will defend our country to the last!" Very good! This is the voice of the valiant Congolese brothers. This voice has resonated throughout Africa and throughout the world. Your staunch and unyielding struggle inspires our enthusiasm and galvanizes the hearts of the people of the world.
    You are not afraid of cannons and airplanes, not afraid of infantry and paratroopers. Historically, the unarmed weak have always ultimately defeated the fully armed strong. This "weak" is the righteous people, who will inevitably defeat the extremely small number of unjust plunderers and oppressors. The almost unarmed Soviet people overthrew the Tsar and Kerensky, drove out the joint intervention army of fourteen imperialist countries, and stood tall and grew stronger. The Chinese people, with only millet plus rifles, also defeated Japanese imperialism, and then drove out U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, standing tall and growing stronger. Aren't these obvious examples from not so long ago? The people's struggle is ultimately the decisive factor.
    Brothers in Leopoldville, resolutely smash all provocations by the Belgian colonial bandits and defend your newly gained independence!
    The colonialist bandits want to seize your beautiful port of Matadi. Congolese brothers and sisters, you will drive these bandits out of Matadi!
    The enemy vainly attempts to reoccupy your beloved Luluabourg. You must drive them out of Luluabourg!
    Working brothers in Jadotville, bury the corpses of your fifty African compatriots, wipe the blood from your bodies, and immediately stand up strongly, bury the executioners on the spot, and defend your priceless treasure—uranium mines!
    You must increase your vigilance a hundredfold. Lions, tigers, and wolves will all come together to deal with us. Aren't the imperialist beasts, led by the United States, already rushing to wave their claws? The American bandits' aircraft carrier "Wasp" has taken the lead. Eisenhower is also plotting to use the signboard of the United Nations to organize intervention. "John Bull" is already instigating the puppets of the Central African Federation to prepare to send troops to invade. West German militarism, inheriting the mantle of the Nazis, is also ready to strike. These bandits are also doing their best to split your motherland and undermine your unity. The instigated "independence" of Katanga Province is part of this conspiracy. However, as long as you see these things, as long as you unite closely, be well prepared, and persist in fighting, then all the enemy's conspiracies will never succeed.
    The flames of your struggle, like the raging fire ignited by the Algerian people, are the true hope of the African people. The sacred cause you have begun is an important part of the great cause of the people of the world against wars of aggression and in defense of world peace. Colonialism is already collapsing. The day of imperialism's death is approaching. Your sacred struggle is making a great contribution not only to your descendants but also to the people of the world. The Chinese people warmly support your struggle. The people of the world warmly support your struggle. You have friends all over the world. And the imperialist colonialists are in unprecedented isolation. The world situation is very favorable to your struggle.
    "We will defend our country to the last!" Good! This "last" can only be the final defeat of the old and new colonialists and your final victory, and nothing else!
    The moment has arrived for the African people to engage in a final decisive battle with imperialism and colonialism! The road ahead will be rugged and tortuous, but you will inevitably win in the end.

### 向英勇的刚果兄弟致敬！

    向英勇的刚果兄弟致敬！
　　钱俊瑞
    你们战斗得好，战斗得结实强韧，英勇的刚果兄弟们！
    骑在你们头上屙屎拉尿、刻骨吮血的是当今一个小小的帝国主义——一小撮比利时殖民主义者。但是只要是帝国主义，便不问是大是小，是狮、是虎、是狼，它们的本性永世不变地是吃人，而且总首先动武。不是吗？只要你们刚站起来维护你们的独立和生存权利时，他们的伞兵、飞机、大炮就来血洗你们的城镇，屠杀你们的同胞，保卫他们的所谓“文明”了。
      “我们将保卫我们的国家直到最后！”好得很！这就是英勇的刚果兄弟的声音。这声音已响遍全非洲，响遍全世界。你们坚强不屈的战斗，鼓舞着我们的干劲，振奋着世界人民的心。
    你们不怕什么大炮飞机，不怕什么步兵伞兵。历史上从来就是手无寸铁的弱者最终战胜全副武装的强者的。这“弱者”就是正义的人民，他们必然最后战胜人数极少的不义的掠夺者、压迫者。几乎是手无寸铁的苏联人民打倒了沙皇和克伦斯基，赶走了十四个帝国主义国家的联合干涉军，巍然站立和壮大起来。只有小米加步枪的中国人民也在打败了日本帝国主义之后，接着就赶走了美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石反动集团，巍然站立和壮大起来。这都不是比较近的明显的例证吗？人民的斗争终究是决定的因素。
    利奥波德维尔的兄弟们，将坚决地粉碎比利时殖民强盗的一切挑衅，保卫住新近获得的独立！
    殖民主义强盗要强占你们美丽的港口马塔迪港。刚果的兄弟姊妹们，你们会把这批强盗从马塔迪赶出去！
    敌人妄想重新占领你们心爱的路路阿堡。你们一定把他们从路路阿堡赶出去！
    贾多特维尔的工人弟兄们，掩埋好你们五十位非洲同胞的尸体，抹干你们身上的血，立刻坚强地站起来，把刽子手们就地埋葬，保卫住你们无价的宝藏——铀矿！
    要百倍提高你们的警惕。狮子、老虎和狼是会一齐来对付我们的。以美国为首的帝国主义野兽们不是已经在争先恐后地挥舞它们的魔爪了么？美国强盗的“黄蜂号”航空母舰已经领先出动。艾森豪威尔又在阴谋利用联合国的招牌来组织干涉。“约翰牛”已经在唆使中非联邦的傀儡准备出兵侵略。继承纳粹衣钵的西德军国主义也已箭在弦上。这伙强盗还在竭尽全力分裂你们的祖国，破坏你们的团结。加丹加省的被唆使宣告“独立”便是这个阴谋的一部分。但是，只要你们看到这些，只要你们紧紧团结，好好戒备，坚持战斗，那么，敌人的一切阴谋诡计决然无法得逞。
    你们战斗的烈火，和阿尔及利亚人民所燃起的熊熊烈火一样，是非洲人民真正的希望。你们已经开始的神圣事业是全世界人民反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的伟大事业的一个重要组成部分。殖民主义已经在土崩瓦解。帝国主义死亡的日子已经日益迫近。你们的神圣斗争不仅对你们的子孙后代，而且对世界人民正在作出伟大的贡献。中国人民热烈地支持你们的斗争。全世界人民热烈支持你们的斗争。你们的朋友遍于全世界。而帝国主义殖民主义者则已陷于空前的孤立。世界形势对于你们的斗争非常有利。
    “我们将保卫我们的国家直到最后！”好啊！这个“最后”只能是新旧殖民主义者的最后失败和你们的最后胜利，而决不会是别的！
    非洲人民向帝国主义、殖民主义进行最后决战的时刻已经到来了！你们前进的道路将是崎岖的、曲折的，但是，你们最后必然胜利。
