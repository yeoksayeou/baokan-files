    Pyongyang, July 27 (by our correspondent) The delegation of the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), which visited our country around the "May Day" holiday at the invitation of the Xinhua News Agency, has successively published articles after returning home, warmly praising the achievements of our people in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction.
    "Rodong Sinmun" published four articles written by members of the delegation consecutively from June 12 to July 15.
    In the article entitled "Mao Zedong Thought Blossoms Everywhere," written by the head of the delegation and Vice President of the Korean Central News Agency, Ko Song-chun, which was serialized by the newspaper on June 12 and 13, the movement of our people in studying Mao Zedong Thought was discussed. The article pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to China's historical conditions, overcame all enemies at home and abroad in the long-term people's revolutionary struggle, and led the Chinese people to victory in the struggle of socialist revolution and socialist construction."
    The article entitled "Starting Factories from Scratch," written by Wu Xianggen, a member of the delegation and KCNA's correspondent in Beijing, which was published on June 17, introduced the deeds of a city people's commune in Zhengzhou City—the Hongqi People's Commune—in running factories. The author said that we saw the vitality of the city people's commune and the tremendous changes in the political, economic, and ideological lives of urban residents from this commune. It also pointed out that the city people's communes started from scratch in production, drawing beautiful socialist gardens on blank paper. The article praised the liberation of women from housework to participate in social labor and introduced the changes in women's thinking: in the past, they compared eating, dressing, and enjoying; now, they compare working and studying actively. The article entitled "Innovation by Everyone, Innovation Everywhere," written by Fang Luoxin, a member of the delegation, which was serialized on July 3 and 6, introduced the achievements of technical innovation in various factories and enterprises in Shanghai.
    The article entitled "The Results of Combining Education and Productive Labor," written by Kim Young-ki, a member of the delegation, was published on the 15th.
