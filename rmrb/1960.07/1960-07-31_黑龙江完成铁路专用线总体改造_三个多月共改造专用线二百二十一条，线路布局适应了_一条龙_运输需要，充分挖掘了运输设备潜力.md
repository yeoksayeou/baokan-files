Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 30th. The major reform of railway spur lines in various cities of Heilongjiang Province, which began in March this year, has been successfully completed. Over the past three months, a total of 221 spur lines have been renovated throughout the province, with a total length of over 100 kilometers. This reform has increased "dragon tracks" and unloading locations, adapting to the needs of "one-stop" transportation, and effectively changing the face of urban transportation.

During the renovation of railway spur lines, all cities in the province made unified arrangements and comprehensive plans based on the distribution of factories and mines and the volume of transportation. Under the principle of basically no state investment, the potential of existing equipment was fully exploited. Various localities used methods such as dismantling long to compensate for short, relocation and reconstruction, and changing junction locations to extend and increase spur lines and throat switches, and adjust in-plant line equipment. According to statistics from nine cities including Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Hegang, a total of 115 unreasonable lines were dismantled, 106 lines were newly built, lengthened, and relocated, and 1,500 cargo spaces were added. In the renovation of spur lines, the three major coal mines of Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Jixi broke the boundaries between the railway and the mines, carried out overall renovation of the station yards and spur lines of both the railway and the mines, and built large coal storage yards, so that the railway bureau's trains could directly reach the mining areas without disassembly or marshalling, and load and transport the entire train. After the completion of the eastern loop line in the Hegang mining area, the train directly entered the mining area for full train loading without disassembly. In June, the entire mining area dispatched 35 more "dragon trains" than in May. In the forest areas, the boundaries between forestry and railways were also broken, connecting the forest railway lines with the railway bureau's lines, and reforming the junction locations, greatly improving transportation efficiency. After many spur lines were converted into public lines in various places, they were more suitable for the loading and unloading of the entire train, thus correspondingly reducing the shunting operations at the station and shortening the vehicle dwell time. After the renovation of the spur lines in Harbin, the number of lines suitable for loading and unloading the entire train increased from 22 to 41. In the second quarter, the dwell time of trains was shortened by more than one hour compared with the first quarter. Since entering July, the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau has been transporting an average of more than 230 more wagons of coal per day than in the same period in June.

After the renovation of the railway spur lines, the layout of the lines is more reasonable, thus shortening the handling distance and creating conditions for mechanized handling. The original railway spur lines of the grain processing plant in Harbin were 70 to 80 meters away from the warehouse, and a large number of porters were needed every day to move the grain transported by train into the warehouse. After the renovation, the spur line is only six or seven meters away from the warehouse, and the train can directly transport the grain to the vicinity of the warehouse, and then the grain can be directly sent to the warehouse with a conveyor belt.

During the renovation of the railway spur lines, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, relevant units gave full play to the spirit of communist collaboration. All factories and enterprises proceeded from the overall interests, achieved mutual support in manpower, materials, and equipment, and ensured the smooth progress of the spur line renovation. Many factories and enterprises in Hegang City suspended their projects that could be temporarily suspended, and concentrated manpower and materials to ensure the construction of spur lines and coal storage yards. During the renovation of the Guxiang area spur line in Harbin, there was a shortage of rails, and the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant took the initiative to dismantle more than 700 meters of idle rails in the plant to provide support.

In order to further exert the role of the renovated spur lines, transportation departments in various places are vigorously promoting the mechanization of handling and loading and unloading. More than 500 high platforms, low cargo spaces, and 39 coal storage yards built in nine cities including Harbin, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang are about to be completed. The high platform and collaborative cargo space built by the Sankeshu Station in Harbin can directly unload bulk materials such as coal, grain, ore, and building materials onto trucks or horse-drawn carts for transportation out of the station.

    黑龙江完成铁路专用线总体改造
    三个多月共改造专用线二百二十一条，线路布局适应了“一条龙”运输需要，充分挖掘了运输设备潜力
    据新华社哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省各城市今年3月份开始进行的铁路专用线大改革的工作，已经胜利完成。三个多月来，全省共改造专用线二百二十一条，总长度达一百多公里。这一改革，增加了“龙道”和卸车地点，适应了“一条龙”运输的需要，有效地改变了城市交通面貌。
    在铁路专用线改造中，全省各城市都根据厂矿企业的分布情况和运量的大小，作了统一安排和全面规划。在基本不要国家投资的原则下，充分挖掘了现有设备的潜力，各地用拆长补短、移设改建、改变接轨地点等办法，延长和增加了专用线和咽喉道岔，调整了厂内线路设备。据哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯、鹤岗等九个城市的统计，共拆除了不合理的线路一百一十五条，新建、补长和移设线路一百零六条，增加了一千五百个货位。鹤岗、双鸭山、鸡西三大煤矿在专用线改造中，打破了铁路和矿山双方的界线，对路矿的站场及专用线进行了总体改造，并修建了大型储煤仓，使路局的列车能够直达矿区，不解体、不编组，成列装车运出。鹤岗矿区东部环形线建成后，列车不解体，直接进入矿区实行了整列装车，全矿区6月份就比5月份多开出“龙车”三十五列。在林区，也打破林业和铁路的界限，把森林铁路线和路局的线路连接起来，并改革了接轨地点，大大提高了运输效率。各地把许多专用线改为公用线后，更加适合于整个列车装卸，因此相应地减少了车站的调车作业，缩短了车辆停留时间。哈尔滨市的专用线改造以后，适于整个列车装卸的线路已由二十二条增加到四十一条，第二季度列车停留时间比第一季度缩短一个多小时。牡丹江铁路局进入7月以来，仅煤炭一项，平均每天就比6月同期多运二百三十多车。
    铁路专用线经过改造，线路的布局更加合理，从而缩短了搬运的距离，为搬运机械化创造了条件。哈尔滨市的粮食加工厂原有铁路专用线都离仓库七、八十米远，每天需要大批搬运工人把火车运来的粮食搬进仓库。改造后的专用线距离仓库仅有六、七米，火车可直接把粮食运到仓库附近，而后再用传送带，就可以把粮食直接送入仓库。
    在铁路专用线改造中，在各级党委领导下，有关单位充分发挥了共产主义大协作精神。各工厂企业都从整体利益出发，做到了人力、物力和设备互相支援，保证了专用线改造的顺利进行。鹤岗市很多工厂企业停下自己可以暂时停下的工程，集中人力、物力保证专用线及贮煤仓的建设。哈尔滨顾乡地区专用线改造中，纲轨不足，哈尔滨车辆厂就主动拆除厂内闲置的钢轨七百多米进行支援。
    为了进一步发挥改造后的专用线的作用，各地运输部门都在大抓搬运、装卸机械化。哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江等九个城市修建的五百多处高站台、低货位及三十九座贮煤仓，即将完成。哈尔滨三棵树车站修建的高站台协作货位，可把煤、粮、矿石及建筑材料等散装物资，直接卸到汽车或马车上运输出站。
