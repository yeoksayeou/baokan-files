Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 5th: In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 60% of the sown area in rural areas has been weeded for the first time, and more than 12.8 million mu have been weeded for the second time. The weeding progress is 60% faster than the same period last year, and the quality has also been generally improved.

Throughout the autonomous region, the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method has led to more than 100,000 cadres at all levels going deep into the fields to participate in and lead production during summer weeding. Many banner and county offices have moved to production teams, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the commune members, and labor efficiency has generally improved. After more than 400 cadres in Kailu County, Jirem League, went deep into the fields, they adopted the method of grasping the production of poorer teams three times in the morning and evening, which greatly accelerated the weeding progress and rapidly improved the quality. At present, the daily weeding progress in the county has increased sharply from 40,000 mu to 100,000 mu. While weeding quickly, extensively, and carefully, all regions have also stepped up watering and topdressing. Now, the entire autonomous region has watered more than 3.97 million mu of seedlings and topdressed 3.6 million mu. In the relatively arid Ulanqab League, people of all ethnic groups have tried every means to increase income and reduce expenditure to expand the irrigated area. Recently, all 57 small reservoirs in the league have been releasing water to irrigate seedlings. Hulunbuir League has launched a seedling upgrading campaign, with 520,000 mu of seedlings topdressed. Some large-scale high-yield fields have been topdressed two or three times.

New-style tools have been widely promoted and used in summer weeding in various regions. More than 130,000 pieces of summer weeding tools have been modified and promoted throughout the region, generally increasing work efficiency by two to six times. In Hulunbuir League, there is an average of one weeder or hoeing machine for every 200 mu of land, and more than 80% of the weeding operations in the league have been semi-mechanized. Zalaite Banner has created tools such as multi-ridge weeding machines, thinning machines, fertilizer spreaders, and fan-type dusting machines, making the entire field management tools complete.

    十万干部深入田间加强领导
    内蒙古锄地进度大大加快
    新华社呼和浩特5日电　内蒙古自治区农村已有占播种面积60％的田锄过头遍，有一千二百八十多万亩锄过二遍。锄地进度比去年同期快了60％，质量也普遍提高。
    全自治区各地由于推行“二五制”领导方法，在夏锄中有十万多名各级干部深入田间参加和领导生产。不少旗县的办公室搬到生产队，大大激发了社员的干劲，劳动效率普遍提高。哲里木盟开鲁县四百多干部深入田间后，对生产较差的队采取早晚抓三次的办法，使锄地进度大大加快，质量迅速提高，目前全县锄地日进度已由四万亩猛增到十万亩。各地在快锄、多锄、细锄的同时，也抓紧了浇水和追肥。现在，全自治区已浇青苗三百九十七万多亩，追肥三百六十万亩。比较干旱的乌兰察布盟，各族社员千方百计地开源节流，扩大浇地面积。最近这个盟的五十七座小型水库已全部放水浇青苗。呼伦贝尔盟开展了禾苗升级运动，有五十二万亩青苗追了肥，有些大面积丰产田已追肥两三次。
    各地在夏锄中普遍推广使用了新式工具。全区改制和推广使用的夏锄工具已有十三万多件，一般能提高工效两倍到六倍。呼伦贝尔盟平均每二百亩地就有一台耘锄或铲趟机，全盟80％以上的除草作业实现了半机械化。扎赉特旗创制出了多垅锄草机、间苗机、追肥车、扇车喷粉机等工具，使整个田间管理工具配套成龙。
