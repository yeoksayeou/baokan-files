In Our Commune

　　In April of this year, the masses elected me as the work team leader, and I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do a good job. The Party branch secretary understood my concerns and said to me, "As long as you humbly learn from the masses and discuss matters with them, things will be easy to handle." So, I mustered up my courage and boldly started working.

　　Once, the brigade arranged for the production of double-cropping late rice, and the general branch committee called for double-cropping late rice to catch up with early rice. At the time, I didn't have confidence. Later, I found two experienced old farmers to discuss it with, and they said, "If we want to strive for a bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice this year, we must pass three 'gates': first, the early ripening gate for early rice; second, the timely sowing gate; and third, the fertilizer gate." I submitted this suggestion to the masses for discussion, and everyone also proposed measures of "one big, two specialized" (vigorously grasping field management of early rice, with specialized personnel for raising seedlings and specialized personnel for accumulating fertilizer). I then made arrangements based on everyone’s opinions. As a result, all eighty-eight mu of early rice in the entire work team were top-dressed with quick-acting fertilizer three times in half a month, and cultivated twice. The seedlings are growing very well, and now they are all round and budding, with the early ones starting to head. Originally, it was estimated that half of them would "eat the Beginning of Autumn water" (mature after the Beginning of Autumn), but now they can all mature by the Great Heat, which can completely catch up with the late rice transplanting season.

　　A few days ago, the public canteen ran out of stored vegetables, and new vegetables could not be supplied for a while. This was a practical problem in the lives of the masses, so I consulted with the old farmer Tang Jide, and he said, "Rape and amaranth grow quickly, and they can be eaten in ten days to half a month after planting." According to this suggestion, we mobilized the masses to use vacant spaces and intercropping methods to sow two mu of summer rape and one mu of amaranth. After ten days, everyone could eat one or two jin of vegetables, and the masses were very satisfied.

### 有事跟群众商量  当好了作业组长

　　有事跟群众商量  当好了作业组长
    今年4月份，群众选我当作业组长，我担心干不好。党支书了解了我的思想顾虑，就对我说，
  “只要虚心向群众学习，有事与群众商量，事情就好办。”于是我就鼓起了勇气，大胆干起来了。有一次，大队布置双季晚稻生产，总支委员会号召双季晚稻赶早稻。当时我心中没有底。后来，找到两个有晚稻生产经验的老农商量，他们说：“今年要争取双季晚稻丰收，就要过好‘三关’，一是早稻早熟关，二是适时播种关，三是肥料关。”我把这个意见交给群众讨论，大家又提出
  “一大二专”（大抓早稻田间管理，专人育秧、专人积肥）的措施。我就根据大家的意见做了安排。结果全作业组八十八亩早稻，半月追速效肥三次，中耕两次，禾苗生长得很好，现在全部圆脚打苞，早的开始抽穗。原来估计有一半要“吃立秋水”，现在全部到大暑就可成熟，完全可以赶得上晚稻插秧季节。
    前些天，公共食堂的存菜吃完了，新菜一时又接不上，这是群众生活中的一个实际问题，我就找老农唐纪德商量，他说：“油菜、苋菜长得快，种上后，十天半月就能吃”。按照这个意见，我们就发动群众利用空坪隙地和套种的办法，播种了两亩夏油菜、一亩苋菜。过了十来天，每人能吃到一二斤菜，群众非常满意。
