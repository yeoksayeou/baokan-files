Industrial production must take steel as the key to drive other sectors and achieve an overall leap forward. Capital construction must concentrate resources to accelerate the progress of key projects, and quickly complete and put them into production. Railway transportation must also make unified and comprehensive arrangements for various transportations under the principle of ensuring key points, in order to adapt to the needs of high-speed development of production.

What is the focus of railway transportation? From the current point of view, it is coal transportation. Coal is the "food" of industry. Ironmaking, steelmaking, power generation, chemical industry... all need coal. "With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel." The comprehensive and sustained leap forward in industrial production, with steel as the key, requires the timely supply of more and better coal. If railway transportation can guarantee the delivery of coal to iron and steel enterprises with quality, quantity, and on time, it will create favorable conditions for a large increase in steel production. After the realization of people's communes in the vast rural areas of our country, due to the development of industries run by communes and the collectivization of life, places that did not use coal in the past are now using coal. Therefore, not only has the demand for coal from large and medium-sized cities and large industries increased sharply, but also the demand for coal from the vast rural areas and various small indigenous and foreign enterprises is increasing day by day. The sharp increase in the demand for coal also shows that China's socialist construction is in a vigorous and prosperous development situation. Because coal plays such a significant role in national economic construction and people's lives, coal transportation is very important in the entire railway transportation. Coal freight volume now accounts for a large proportion of the total railway freight volume in the country, so railway transportation must firmly grasp the main link of coal transportation, first specifically arrange coal transportation well, in order to drive other transportation to move forward. If we do not adopt the principle of making overall arrangements under the principle of ensuring key points, but instead use forces evenly, regardless of the importance and urgency, the result will inevitably be a dispersion of forces, which will neither meet the requirements of all parties nor guarantee the key points. Therefore, in railway transportation, there is also the issue of the whole country acting as one, and we must also implement the principle of prioritizing the country over the locality, and prioritizing the key points over the general. We must arrange transportation in accordance with the national industrial production principle of taking steel as the key, and regard coal transportation as the focus of the entire transportation. Transporting more coal, transporting coal faster, and ensuring the victorious completion of the coal grabbing and steel guaranteeing tasks is the glorious task of railway workers across the country. Railway workers should establish the idea of serving coal production, and be determined: "Only let the train wait for the coal, not let the coal wait for the train." Coal mine workers should also be determined: "Only let the coal wait for the train, not let the train wait for the coal." Everyone should work together to ensure that the coal produced in the mines can be directly loaded and transported, ensuring that no coal is left on the ground, and that every ton of coal is transported to the places where it is urgently needed.

How can railway transportation ensure that coal transportation is the focus and complete the coal transportation task better in the second half of this year? The experience in the first half of the year tells us that, first of all, the leadership must thoroughly grasp every aspect from planning to loading and unloading in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner. We must never make rough arrangements and cursory inspections in a broad and generalized way, but instead inspect one mine after another, one train after another, and solve problems immediately when they are discovered. Only by grasping it in this concrete way can we guarantee the completion of coal transportation tasks on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. The practice of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in this regard is worth promoting. In order to effectively strengthen coal transportation, leading cadres of this bureau are assigned to districts, contracted by area, and responsible to the end. The entire bureau has two sets of transportation cadres from top to bottom, ensuring continuous organization and command of transportation day and night. As a result, the bureau's coal transportation task was completed well. It can be seen that hard work will definitely lead to good results.

Secondly, we must take strong and specific measures, especially to vigorously promote advanced experience in ensuring coal transportation. In vigorously developing "one-dragon" transportation, we must establish "coal dragon" as the head of all "dragons" and strive to incorporate more than 60% of the coal transportation volume into the "one-dragon" transportation plan. The key to doing a good job in coal transportation "one-dragon" is to combine the vigorous mass movement with solid organizational work. "One-dragon" transportation is a comprehensive collaboration of production, supply, transportation, and sales. The wider the scope of collaboration and the more aspects involved, the more detailed the organizational work of all aspects and links must be done, otherwise, it cannot form a unified and coordinated whole, and the "dragon's" operation will not be flexible, and it cannot exert the "dragon's" power. In order to ensure that coal is not left on the ground, storing a certain number of spare cars in major coal mines is an effective method. Any work must be both active and advanced, and also leave room for maneuver. Coal transportation is no exception. With a certain number of spare cars, not only can we solve the urgent need for coal transportation, but also the transportation of other materials can be arranged more proactively. After the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau organized spare cars in May, it not only ensured the completion of the coal transportation task, but also completed the timber transportation plan that had not been completed month after month in the past. It can be seen that the implementation of the method of storing spare cars in mines is not only conducive to coal transportation, but also conducive to the entire transportation work.

To ensure that the coal transportation task is completed well, a very important point is that both coal mine workers and railway workers must greatly promote the spirit of communist cooperation. For example, regardless of whether it is a large or small mine, they should try their best to produce more coal in mines with better transportation conditions, and use production to ensure that railway transportation has a sufficient source of goods. Coal mines should also build large coal storage yards, repair landslide-style high platforms, accelerate the construction of short-distance handling equipment, and learn from the experiences of Fuxin and Hegang and other places to systematically carry out the overall transformation of road-mine station lines. These are all important and specific measures to ensure that loading is fast and transportation is fast. In these aspects, railway workers should also actively support and participate, and do these tasks quickly and well.

The transportation in the second half of the year has already begun. Currently, it is a particularly tense time for coal transportation. First, the rainy season is approaching (it has already arrived in some places), and the coal stored in the coal mines must be transported away before the heavy rain arrives. Second, factories and enterprises need a certain amount of stored coal for production in the second half of the year. Railway transportation connects mines in the front and factories in the back. Further improving coal transportation is related to the continued leap forward of the entire national economy. Therefore, comrades in the railway transportation department must summarize the experience of the first half of the year well, actively take concrete measures, resolutely implement the principle of focusing on coal transportation, and do concrete organizational work in all aspects to ensure that industrial production continuously obtains the "food" it needs and promotes greater growth in production in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.

### 铁路运输要以运煤为重点

    铁路运输要以运煤为重点
    工业生产要以钢为纲，才能带动其它、全面跃进。基本建设要集中力量，才能加快重点工程进度，迅速建成并投入生产。铁路运输也必须在保证重点的方针下对各项运输进行统一的全面安排，才能适应高速度发展生产的需要。
    什么是铁路运输的重点呢？从当前来看，是煤炭运输。煤炭是工业的“粮食”。炼铁、炼钢、发电、化工……都需要煤，“有煤才有铁，有铁才有钢”。以钢为纲的工业生产的全面持续跃进，要求及时供应更多更好的煤炭。铁路运输能够保证按质、按量、按时地把煤炭送到钢铁企业，就为钢铁大增产创造了有利条件。我国广大农村实现了人民公社化以后，由于公社办工业，生活集体化的发展，过去不用煤的地方，现在也用煤了。因此，不仅大中城市、大工业对煤炭的需要量剧增，广大农村和各种小土群、小洋群企业对煤炭的需要，也与日俱增了。对煤炭需要量的猛烈增加，也说明了我国社会主义建设正处在蓬蓬勃勃发展的大好形势之中。由于煤炭在国家经济建设中和人民生活中有着这样重大的作用，煤炭运输在整个铁路运输中的地位是十分重要的。现在煤炭运量占全国铁路总货运量的比重很大，因此铁路运输必须紧紧抓住运煤这个主要环节，首先具体安排好煤炭运输，才能带动其它运输向前发展。如果不采取在保证重点的方针下进行全面安排的方针，而是不分轻重缓急，平均使用力量，结果必然会分散了力量，既不能满足各方面的要求，也不能保证重点。所以在铁路运输中，也有全国一盘棋的问题，也必须贯彻先国家后地方，先重点后一般的原则，必须按照国家工业生产以钢为纲的方针来进行运输的安排，把煤炭运输作为整个运输中的重点。多运煤，快运煤，保证夺煤保钢任务的胜利完成，这是全国铁路职工的光荣任务。铁路职工应树立为煤炭生产服务的思想，要下定这样的决心：“只叫车等煤，不叫煤等车”，煤矿职工也要下定“只叫煤等车，不叫车等煤”的决心，大家同心协力，使矿井生产出来的煤能够直接装车运走，保证产煤不落地，一车一吨不欠地把煤炭运到急需的地方去。
    铁路运输怎样保证以运煤为重点，在今年下半年把煤炭运输任务完成得更好呢？上半年的经验告诉我们，首先领导上必须从编制计划到装车卸车，踏实地、细致地一抓到底。绝不能大而化之地草草布置，草草检查，而要一个矿一个矿的检查，一个列车一个列车的检查，发现问题，立即解决。只有这样具体地抓，才能保证按日按旬按月地完成运煤任务。在这方面锦州铁路局的做法是值得提倡的。这个局为了切实加强运煤工作，领导干部按区进行分工，分片包干，一包到底，全局从上到下备有两套运输干部，保证昼夜连续不断地组织和指挥运输。结果这个局的运煤任务就完成得好。可见，下了苦功夫，是一定会有好收成的。
    其次，要采取强有力的具体措施，特别是要大力推广保证煤炭运输的先进经验。在大搞“一条龙”运输中，必须确立以“煤龙”为群“龙”之首，力求把煤炭运量的60％以上纳入“一条龙”运输计划。搞好煤运“一条龙”的关键，是把轰轰烈烈的群众运动和扎扎实实的组织工作结合起来。“一条龙”运输大协作是产、供、运、销的全面大协作，协作的范围越广、方面越多，各个方面、各个环节的组织工作便要做得越细，否则便不能结成步调一致呼吸相通的整体，“龙”的运行也就不灵活了，不能发挥“龙”的威力了。为了保证产煤不落地，在主要煤矿存放一定数量的备用车，是一个有效办法。任何工作，都要既积极先进，又要留有余地，煤炭运输也不例外。有了一定数量的备用车，不但可以解决运煤的急需，其他物资的运输也可以更主动安排了。牡丹江铁路局在5月份组织了备用车以后，不但保证了煤运任务的完成，过去月月完不成的木材运输计划也完成了。可见，实行矿山存放备用车的办法，不但有利于运煤，也是有利于整个运输工作的。
    要保证运煤任务完成得好，极为重要的一条是煤矿职工和铁路职工都要大大发扬共产主义协作精神，比如不论大矿或小矿都应尽量争取在运输条件较好的矿多生产些煤炭，用生产来保证铁路运输有充足的货源。煤矿还应当大建储煤仓，大修滑坡式高站台，加速短距离搬运设备的建设，学习阜新和鹤岗等地的经验，有步骤地进行路矿站线总体改造，这些都是保证装得快、运得快的重要具体措施。在这些方面，铁路职工也应当积极支援和参加，把这些工作办得又快又好。
    下半年的运输已经开始了。目前正是运煤任务特别紧张的时候，一是雨季即至（有的地方已经来到），煤矿的存煤必须在大雨到来之前运走；二是工厂企业下半年的生产，需要有一定数量的存煤。铁路运输前接矿山，后连工厂，进一步做好煤炭运输，关系到整个国民经济的继续跃进，因此铁路运输部门的同志必须很好地总结上半年的经验，积极地采取具体措施，坚决贯彻以运煤为重点的方针，从各方面做好具体的组织工作，以保证工业生产不断地获得所需要的“粮食”，促进下半年生产比上半年有更大的增长。
