Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 19th: Xianfeng People's Commune in Jiang'an District, Wuhan City, attaches importance to the consolidation of childcare organizations.

    Since the broad masses of women participated in social labor, the commune has extensively established various types of childcare organizations, including kindergartens, nurseries, childcare groups, foster families, children's safety stations, and children's clubs, making do with whatever was available. Because of the rapid development, there were significant disparities between the educational level, teaching quality, equipment, economic conditions, and management systems of the new kindergartens and nurseries and those of the old ones. There was also a lack of connection between the various kindergartens and nurseries. Under these circumstances, the commune timely rectified and consolidated the childcare organizations, established central kindergartens and central nurseries, and through them, united all 102 commune-run and management district-run kindergartens and nurseries, forming a combined large, medium, and small "one-stop" system. Children from 56 days old until school age can be sent for childcare.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 19th: The Party branch of the Daxing Branch of the Qiaodong People's Commune in Shijiazhuang City, in order to adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of childcare organizations and kindergartens in urban people's communes, has adopted the method of large kindergartens leading small kindergartens, large nurseries leading small nurseries, old kindergartens leading new kindergartens, and old nurseries leading new nurseries, to actively popularize and improve the professional level of childcare personnel. Within the 46 childcare organizations under the branch, several kindergartens with longer establishment times and more experience are at the core, linked with several medium-sized nurseries and kindergartens respectively; these medium-sized nurseries and kindergartens are in turn connected with several small nurseries and kindergartens, forming a "pyramid-shaped" childcare organization collaboration network.

    The establishment of the "pyramid-shaped" collaboration network has brought about a new leap forward in various kindergartens and nurseries. Newly built childcare organizations have initially mastered childcare knowledge in a relatively short period of time, enabling the work of kindergartens and nurseries to get on the right track.

    托儿组织加强协作共同提高
    据新华社武汉19日电　武汉市江岸区先锋人民公社重视托幼组织的巩固工作。
    这个公社自从广大妇女参加社会劳动以后，幼儿园、托儿所、托儿组、寄托户、儿童安全站、儿童俱乐部等多种多样的托幼组织，因陋就简地广泛建立起来。因为发展快，新幼儿园、托儿所的保教人员水平、教养质量、设备和经济条件，以及管理制度等，与老幼儿园托儿所很悬殊，各幼儿园托儿所之间也缺少联系。在这种情况下，公社及时地对托幼组织进行整顿、巩固，建立了中心幼儿园和中心托儿所，并通过它把全社一百零二个社办、管理区办的幼儿园、托儿所团结在一起，形成大中小结合的一条龙。孩子从五十六天到入学都可以送托。
    据新华社天津19日电　石家庄市桥东人民公社大兴分社党支部，为了适应城市人民公社托儿所、幼儿园组织迅速发展的新情况，采取大园带小园、大所带小所，老园带新园、老所带新所的办法，积极普及与提高保教人员的业务水平。在分社所属的四十六个托幼组织内，以几个建立时间较长、经验比较丰富的幼儿园为核心，分别和几个中等托儿所、幼儿园挂钩；这些中等的托儿所、幼儿园又分别和几个小型托儿所、幼儿园组织建立联系，形成了“宝塔式”的托儿所、幼儿园协作网。
    “宝塔式”协作网的建立，使各幼儿园、托儿所出现了新的跃进局面。新建的托儿所幼儿园组织在比较短期的时间内，初步掌握了保教知识，使幼儿园、托儿所的工作走上了正轨。
