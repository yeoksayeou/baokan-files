Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: The Organization of American States (OAS), controlled by the United States, announced on the 14th that it would hold a Council meeting on the 16th to discuss the issue of convening a meeting of foreign ministers of the OAS member states to consider dealing with the so-called "threat of international communism." This is an important development in the conspiracy recently intensified by the United States to openly interfere in Cuba under the pretext of "anti-communism" by using the Organization of American States.

In order to conceal the face of the mastermind, the United States, this conspiracy planned by the United States took the form of a request put forward by Peru. According to reports, the request, formally made by Peru, to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of the OAS member states stated that the purpose of the proposed meeting was to consider the issue of so-called "defending the regional system and the democratic principles of the Americas." According to Agence France-Presse on the 13th, quoting well-informed sources in Washington, the United States will take the lead at the OAS meeting in demanding the "invocation of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" in order to carry out blatant interference and aggression against Cuba.

In order to promote this conspiracy of the United States and further coerce American countries to obey Washington, the U.S. State Department issued two statements in succession on the 14th. On the one hand, it expressed "welcome" to the above-mentioned request made by Peru, and on the other hand, it arrogantly announced that the United States insists on the "Monroe Doctrine," which aims to control and enslave Latin American countries, and advocated using the full set of intervention tools of the "Inter-American Security System" to stifle the Cuban revolution.

In its first brief statement, the U.S. State Department claimed that Peru's proposal "conforms to the principles of the Organization of American States." The statement described Cuba's just action of resisting U.S. aggression as a "threat to the internal unity, security, and democracy of the Americas," saying that this "threat" "has a direct and serious relationship with all twenty-one countries (of the OAS)," attempting to drag these countries into the U.S. trap and force them to follow the U.S. action of interfering in Cuba.

In another statement, the U.S. State Department shamelessly slandered the Soviet Union's solemn position of supporting the Cuban people in opposing U.S. aggression as "interfering in the affairs of other countries," and showed the hideous face of the United States as the gendarme of Latin America, claiming that the "principle of the Monroe Doctrine," which has long been spurned by the people of Latin American countries, "is as effective today as it was when this doctrine was announced in 1823." In this regard, the statement clamored that the charter of the Organization of American States and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty stipulate the method of "taking concerted action" to prevent the so-called "intrusion of international communism into this hemisphere." The statement also indicated that the United States will, under the banner of "anti-communism," invoke these two treaties, which the United States has consistently used to suppress the national democratic movements in Latin America, to carry out more vicious interference in Cuba.

### 用“反共”作借口策划侵略阴谋　美国加紧利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴

　　用“反共”作借口策划侵略阴谋
　　美国加紧利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：由美国控制的美洲国家组织14日宣布，它将在16日举行理事会会议，讨论关于召开美洲国家组织成员国外长会议来考虑对付所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的问题。这是美国最近加紧策划的在“反共”借口下利用美洲国家组织来公开干涉古巴的阴谋的重要发展。
    为了掩饰美国的主谋者的面目，这个由美国一手策划的阴谋采取了由秘鲁出面提出请求的方式。据报道，形式上由秘鲁提出的关于召开美洲国家外长会议的这项请求说，拟议举行的这次美洲国家组织成员国外长会议的目的，在于考虑所谓“保卫区域制度和美洲民主原则”问题。据法新社13日援引华盛顿消息灵通人士的话透露，美国将在美洲国家组织的会议上带头要求“援用泛美互助条约”以便对古巴实行明目张胆的干涉和侵略。
    为了推行美国的这项阴谋和进一步胁迫美洲国家听命于华盛顿，美国国务院在14日这一天接连发表两项声明，它一方面表示“欢迎”由秘鲁出面提出的上述请求，另方面蛮横地宣布美国坚持目的在于控制和奴役拉丁美洲国家的“门罗主义”，鼓吹利用“泛美安全体系”的全套干涉工具来扼杀古巴革命。
    美国国务院在它发表的第一项简短的声明中宣称，秘鲁提出的主张“符合美洲国家组织的原则”，声明把古巴反抗美国侵略的正义行动说成是“对美洲内部团结、安全和民主的威胁”，说这种“威胁”“对（美洲国家组织的）所有二十一个国家都有直接的和严重的关系”，企图借此把这些国家拉进美国的圈套，迫使它们追随美国干涉古巴的行动。
    在另一项声明中，美国国务院无耻地诬蔑苏联支持古巴人民反对美国侵略的严正立场是“干涉其它国家事务”，并且摆出美国作为拉丁美洲的宪兵的狰狞面目，声称早已遭到拉丁美洲各国人民唾弃的“门罗主义原则”“今天正像1823年宣布这个主义时一样有效”。在这方面，声明叫嚷说，美洲国家组织的宪章和里约热内卢公约规定了“采取一致行动”来防止所谓“国际共产主义侵入这个半球”的办法。声明还表明，美国将打着“反共”旗号，援用这两项美国一贯用来镇压拉丁美洲民族民主运动的条约来对古巴进行更加凶恶的干涉。
