Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 10th: "Hoy" newspaper today published a report made by the General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, Roca, on July 8th at the expanded meeting of the National Committee Executive Bureau of the Cuban People's Socialist Party. In the report, Roca called on the Cuban people to take up arms when necessary to resist US aggression.

Roca, while strongly condemning the economic aggression launched by US imperialism against Cuba, pointed out that the US's "shameless economic aggression is clearly caused by political reasons, the purpose of which is to destroy the revolution, undermine Cuban sovereignty, and restore its rule over our country relying on war criminals, thieves, and traitors."

Roca said, "The US imperialists, headed by Eisenhower, are attempting to use some Latin American countries to oppose other Latin American countries, so that all these countries will continue to be in a state of enslavement, exploitation, and underdevelopment. They are attempting to use sugar-producing countries to oppose Cuba, in order to extinguish the Cuban revolution, reoccupy Cuba, and then use Cuban sugar production to oppose other Latin American countries."

Roca pointed out that economic warfare is bound to be long-term and will inevitably bring us various difficulties and sacrifices. Despite this, we can and should win this war.

Roca emphasized that economic warfare may lead to a military war, or economic warfare may be combined with military warfare in one way or another. "It is almost certain that the US imperialism, desperate due to the failures already encountered and to be encountered, will attempt to use the difficulties that economic warfare may cause us to launch some form of armed attack."

Roca emphasized, "Whether in the economic war that has already begun—no matter how long it lasts—or in a war of armed aggression, Cuba can achieve victory."

Roca said that Cuba's "revolutionary government and people are not afraid of US imperialism, they will not surrender to US imperialism, they will never kneel down, and they will never submit to the Organization of American States. They do not believe in any Western geographical determinism, economic supplementation theory, or other similar lies, which are excuses used to justify cowardice and submission to imperialism."

Roca finally called on all Cuban people:
	"To take up arms to fight when necessary!"

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 9th: The Cuban Ministry of Trade today issued a decision, ordering American-owned enterprises or enterprises with American shares in Cuba to report to the relevant Cuban authorities, within three days, the reserve quantities of all raw materials, fuels, lubricants, accessories, and other materials required for these enterprises to conduct activities.

The decision stated, "The US government and Congress have taken economic retaliatory measures against the Cuban people and government's determination to fully exercise our sovereignty as a free and independent nation. It is clear that the activities of certain foreign enterprises in opposing our decrees have helped this thorough aggression policy against our country's interests."

The decision stated that the purpose of the above-mentioned measures taken by the Cuban government is to avoid disrupting normal commercial activities, national industrial production, or important public service industries.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 7th: Cuban newspapers continue to condemn the US government's economic aggression against Cuba. "Revolución" newspaper, commenting on Eisenhower's decision to stop importing Cuban sugar, pointed out that this action shows that Eisenhower is the head of the US exploitative group and a tool of the colonialist and imperialist system.

While exposing Eisenhower's hypocritical friendship and genuine aggression, the newspaper said, "We Cubans do not believe in those friendly words at all," because "your Marine Corps bayonets have slaughtered innocent people; your merchants have plundered much wealth; your corrupt newspapers have spread lies; your officials have shamelessly slandered our dearest leaders." The newspaper said, "The sins you have committed against us in the past have reached such a point that six million Cubans regard sacrificing themselves to defend the fruits of victory as an honor." "Sierra Maestra" newspaper pointed out that those who are carrying out economic aggression are the same people who massacre Latin American people, impose military alliance treaties on Japan, and use its territory as a base for aggression against other countries' people.

"Hoy" newspaper pointed out that while carrying out economic aggression, the United States is stepping up preparations for armed intervention in Cuba. The newspaper revealed that Eisenhower held a meeting with the National Security Council on July 7th, and afterwards, White House Press Secretary Hagerty admitted that relations with Cuba were the main reason for holding the meeting. "Hoy" newspaper called on people to pay attention to the fact that senior US and British military leaders in the Caribbean recently held an "emergency" meeting in San Juan.

    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加向人民发出号召
　　准备拿起武器抗击美国侵略
　　古巴政府限令美国企业报告物资储备情况
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　“今日报”今天发表了古巴人民社会党总书记罗加7月8日在古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局扩大会议上所作的报告。罗加在报告中号召古巴人民在必要时拿起武器，抗击美国的侵略。
    罗加在强烈谴责美帝国主义对古巴发动的经济侵略时指出，美国的“这次厚颜无耻的经济侵略显然是由于政治原因引起的，其目的在于摧毁革命、破坏古巴主权和恢复它依靠战争罪犯、窃贼和叛徒对我国进行的统治”。
    罗加说，“以艾森豪威尔为首的美帝国主义者企图利用一些拉丁美洲国家来反对另一些拉丁美洲国家，以便使所有这些国家都继续处于被奴役、被剥削和不发达的状态。他们企图利用食糖生产国家来反对古巴，以便扑灭古巴革命，重新霸占古巴，然后再利用古巴的蔗糖生产来反对其它拉丁美洲国家。”
    罗加指出，经济战必然会是长期的，并且不可避免地会给我们带来各种困难和牺牲，尽管这样，我们能够而且应该赢得这场战争的胜利。
    罗加强调说，经济战可能导致一场军事战争，也可能经济战将以这种或那种方式同军事战结合在一起。“几乎可以肯定的是，由于已经遭到的和将要遭到的失败而感到绝望的美帝国主义，将企图利用经济战可能给我们造成的困难来发动这种或那种形式的武装进攻。”
    罗加强调说，“无论在已经展开的经济战中——不管时间多长——或是在武装侵略的战争中，古巴都能取得胜利。”
    罗加说，古巴“革命政府和人民都不怕美帝国主义，他们不会向美帝国主义投降，他们决不屈膝，也决不屈从美洲国家组织。他们不相信西方的任何地理宿命论、经济补充论和其他类似的谎言，这些谎言是用来为对帝国主义的懦怯和屈从做辩解的借口。”
    罗加最后号召全体古巴人民
  “在一旦必要时拿起武器进行战斗！”
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴贸易部今天发布一项决定，限令美国人在古巴的企业或有他们的股份的企业，在三天内向古巴有关当局报告它们所有的原料、燃料、润滑剂、配件以及这些企业进行活动所需要的其它物资的储备数量。
    决定说，“美国政府和国会对古巴人民和政府决心作为一个自由和独立国家完全行使我们的主权的立场，采取了经济报复的手段。很清楚，某些外国企业反对我们的法令的活动帮助了这个彻头彻尾的反对我国利益的侵略政策。”
    决定说，古巴政府采取的上述措施的目的是为了避免使商业活动、国家工业生产或重要的公共服务行业的正常活动遭到中断。
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　古巴报纸继续谴责美国政府对古巴进行的经济侵略。“革命报”在评论艾森豪威尔关于停止进口古巴食糖的决定时指出，这种行动表明艾森豪威尔是美国剥削集团的魁首，是殖民主义和帝国主义制度的工具。
    这家报纸在揭露艾森豪威尔的假友好、真侵略的嘴脸时说，“我们古巴人丝毫也不相信那些友好的词句”，因为“你们海军陆战队的刺刀屠杀了无辜的人们；你们的商人巧取豪夺了许多财富；你们腐朽的报纸撒下了漫天大谎；你们的官员无耻地诬蔑了我们最亲爱的领袖。”报纸说，“你们过去使我们受的罪到达了这样的地步，以至于六百万古巴人把为保卫胜利果实而牺牲当作荣誉。”“马埃斯特腊山报”指出，进行经济侵略的人正是那些屠杀拉丁美洲人民、把军事同盟条约强加给日本、利用它的领土作为侵略别国人民的基地的人。
    “今日报”指出，美国在进行经济侵略的同时，正在加紧准备武装干涉古巴。这家报纸揭露说，艾森豪威尔7日同国家安全委员会举行了会议，事后，白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂承认，同古巴的关系是举行这次会议的主要原因。“今日报”号召人们注意：美国和英国驻加勒比地区的高级军事首脑最近在圣胡安举行了“紧急”会晤。
