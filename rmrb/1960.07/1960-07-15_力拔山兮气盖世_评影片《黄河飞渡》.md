　　"With Strength to Uproot Mountains, and Spirit to Cover the World"
　　——A Review of the Film "Flying Over the Yellow River"
　　Yuan Wenshu
    Our era is an era of heroes, and our heroes are heroes of the times. They can make high mountains bow their heads, and they can make rivers give way. In the construction of the Kangzang Highway, in the filling of the Xiamen Seawall, in the diversion of the Tao River up the mountains, and in the recent ascent of Mount Everest from the north slope, and in countless other heroic feats, the heroic spirit of "with strength to uproot mountains and spirit to cover the world" is displayed everywhere. This is the great beginning of the liberated people, after taking control of their own destiny, marching toward nature. Such heroic feats of the people are unprecedented and amazing, yet they are abundant in our lives today.
    The film "Flying Over the Yellow River" is a work that reflects the great achievements of the people on both sides of the Yellow River, under the brilliant illumination of our Party's General Line, bringing into play their soaring drive to resolutely divert the Yellow River water to the high plateau, so that the Yellow River, which has caused harm for thousands of years, can benefit the people. The creators vividly embody the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of the masses of the people through the events of digging canals to divert water and erecting aqueducts to fly the Yellow River water across the Yellow River. The film is full of the spirit of labor, struggle, collectivism, and optimism. It is of great significance for encouraging the people to not fear hardships or difficulties, to bravely wage war against the earth, and to build our new socialist life.
    In terms of character portrayal, the creators have focused more on depicting a collective image, so many scenes of collective labor and tense scenes of conquering key projects are handled naturally and vividly. It simply expresses the different thoughts, feelings, and emotional states of various characters in the struggle against various difficulties. Despite the various contradictions and conflicts, they are all true and credible, not generalized. Although the creators did not deliberately portray the individual characteristics of the characters, figures such as Wang Kai, Jin Biao, Juncai, and Ding Fugui are still quite vivid. Ding Fugui is a character who appears as the opposite side of the conflict, but the author does not excessively exaggerate his dark emotions from his conservative, timid, and other backward aspects. He exists only as a reaction to objective difficulties. Therefore, although the contradiction and conflict between the advanced and the backward develops from beginning to end, it is not simply treated as a completely negative character. On the contrary, he has been following everyone forward, and he even made a contribution at the critical moment of forcefully crossing the Black Tiger Waves. He has not lost the true qualities of the working people. Therefore, the shaping of this image is also relatively true and credible. Even this criticized character can have enlightening and educational significance.
    In terms of plot structure, it is generally relatively healthy and simple. The arrangement of three segments of the plot is particularly vivid and powerful. First, when difficulties arise in the Black Tiger Mountain project, the method of "posting a notice to recruit talents" is adopted to mobilize the masses and bring into play the wisdom of the masses. Through the action of each township's migrant worker team competing to unveil the red list, a warm atmosphere is created, reflecting the firm will of each team of migrant workers to never bow their heads in the face of difficulties. The clever use of the traditional form of "posting a notice to recruit talents," endowing it with new content, further adds to the film's national character. Second, the two plots of Ding Fugui cleverly crossing the Black Tiger Waves and Wang Kai risking his life to save Juncai in the big explosion are also arranged to be tense, thrilling, intense, and moving. Many plot clues that were laid out and foreshadowed at the beginning of the film are concentratedly expressed here. Through these intense actions, the noble qualities of the characters are further displayed. These vivid plots powerfully embody the film's theme.
    In terms of expressing the Party's leadership, the film has also achieved considerable success. Although Secretary Zhao does not appear often, whenever an important juncture arrives, Secretary Zhao always stands among the masses, guiding them towards a new stage of development, embodying the Party's leadership and the traditional fine style of always combining leadership with the masses.
    The creation of the film "Flying Over the Yellow River" is a significant achievement. Of course, as a further requirement, the film still has some relatively significant shortcomings in its artistic expression: First, the environmental location is not clearly explained. For example, at the beginning, it is never clear to the audience whether many of the plots are happening in South Plateau or North Plateau. As an expression of film art, the environmental location needs to be clearly explained to the audience at the beginning, otherwise it will constantly cause the audience's questions, hindering the audience from quickly concentrating their emotions. Second, there is a lack of organic connection between some scenes. For example, Wang Kai's surveying, Ding Fugui's repairing of the crane, and other scenes often change locations or positions without any mental preparation from the audience. Third, in the portrayal of characters, there is a lack of relatively delicate depiction, thus making the individual characteristics of several main characters not vivid enough. If there could be a relatively quiet opportunity to portray their inner activities in the description of their contradictions and conflicts, instead of always being in a hurried activity, it would not only help the completeness of these images, but also help strengthen the sense of rhythm of the entire film. Expressing characters through actions is one of the basic methods of shaping characters in film, but the understanding of actions should not be limited to the external aspects. In reflecting people's spiritual outlook, people's inner actions are often expressed more richly and profoundly.
    "Flying Over the Yellow River" is the first film co-produced by Lanzhou Film Studio and Changchun Film Studio, and it is also the first feature film of the Lanzhou factory. The factory is newly established, and several main actors are also on the screen for the first time. Thanks to collective efforts, there have already been achievements worthy of congratulation. As long as we continue to work hard and strive arduously, we can rapidly develop in practice and continuously improve the level of our works. The heroic era requires heroic writing to reflect it. Let us all work together! (Attached picture)

### “力拔山兮气盖世”——评影片《黄河飞渡》

　　“力拔山兮气盖世”
　　——评影片《黄河飞渡》
　　袁文殊
    我们的时代，是一个英雄的时代，我们的英雄，都是时代的英雄。他们可以叫高山低头，可以叫河水让路。在康藏公路的修建中，在厦门海堤的填筑中，在引洮上山和最近从北坡登上珠穆朗玛顶峰等等数不清的壮举中，处处都表现出“力拔山兮气盖世”的英雄气概。这是解放了的人民，在自己掌握了自己命运之后，向大自然进军的伟大的开端。这种人民英雄的壮举是空前的、惊人的，而在我们今天的生活中，却又是大量存在的。
    影片《黄河飞渡》就是反映在我们党的总路线光辉照耀下，黄河两岸的人民发挥了冲天干劲，坚决要把黄水引上高塬，使为害万年的黄河为人民造福的伟大事迹的作品。创作者们通过开渠引水，架设渡槽，把黄水飞渡黄河的事件，生动地体现了人民群众的大跃进的精神。影片充满着劳动的、战斗的、集体的和乐观的精神。对于鼓舞人民不怕艰险，不怕困难，勇敢地向地球开战，建设我们的社会主义新生活是有重大意义的。
    在人物塑造方面，创作者们更多地着力于群像的描写，因此许多集体劳动的场面和征服关键性工程的紧张场面都处理得自然和生动。它朴素地表现了各种人物在和各种困难作斗争中的不同的思想感情和情绪状态。尽管有各种不同的矛盾冲突，但是都真实可信，不一般化。尽管创作者们没有着意地去刻划人物的个性特征，但是像王凯、金彪、俊才和丁富贵这些人物也还相当生动。丁富贵是作为冲突的对立面而出现的人物，但是作者并没有过多地从他的保守、畏缩等等落后方面去渲染他的阴暗情绪，他只是作为客观困难的一种反应而存在，因此，虽然自始至终发展着先进和落后的矛盾冲突，但它却不是简单地当作完全被否定的人物来处理，相反地他一直还是跟着大家在前进，而且在强渡黑虎浪的紧要关头还立了一功，他并没有失去劳动人民的本色。因此这个形象的塑造也是比较真实可信的。即使是这个被批判的人物，也能有给人以启发教育的意义。
    在情节结构方面，一般说来也还是比较健康朴素的，其中有三段情节的安排特别生动而有力。一是当黑虎山的工程发生困难，采取“出榜招贤”的办法来鼓动群众和发挥群众的智慧，通过各乡民工队竞揭红榜的动作，造成一股热烈的气氛，反映了各队民工在困难面前决不低头的坚强意志。巧妙运用“出榜招贤”的传统形式，赋予新的内容，更给影片增添了民族的色彩。二是在丁富贵巧渡黑虎浪和大爆破中王凯冒险救俊才的两个情节，也安排得紧张、惊险、剧烈、动人。影片一开始就布置和埋伏下来的许多情节线索都在这里得到集中的表现。通过这些强烈的动作，使得人物的高尚品质进一步得到了展示。这些生动的情节，有力地体现了影片的主题思想。
    在表现党的领导方面，影片也获得了相当的成就。赵书记这个人物出场虽然不多，但是每当一个重要的关头到来时候，赵书记总是站在群众当中引导群众走向新的发展阶段上去，体现了党的领导力量，体现了领导和群众始终结合在一起的传统的优良作风。
    影片《黄河飞渡》的创作是有较大成绩的。当然，如作为进一步的要求说来，影片在艺术表现上也还存在着某些比较显著的缺点：一是对环境地点交代不清。如开始时许多情节到底发生在南塬，还是发生在北塬，始终叫人看不清楚。而作为电影艺术的表现来说，需要在一开场就把环境地点向观众交代清楚，否则就会不断引起观众的疑问，妨碍观众把情绪迅速地集中起来。二是有些场景和场景之间还缺乏有机的联系。如王凯的测量，丁富贵的修理天车等等场面，常常在观众毫无精神准备的情况之下就变换了地点或位置。三是在人物描写上，还缺乏比较细腻的刻划，因而使得几个主要人物的个性特征还不够鲜明。假如在描写他们的矛盾冲突中能够有一个比较安静机会来刻划他们的内心活动，而不是一直处在匆忙的活动之中，则不但有助于这些形象的完整性的塑造，而且有助于全部影片的节奏感的加强。通过动作来表现人物，是电影塑造人物的基本方法之一，但是对于动作的理解不能仅仅局限于外在的方面，在反映人的精神面貌说来，人的内在动作往往表现得更为丰富、深刻。
    《黄河飞渡》是兰州电影制片厂和长春电影制片厂合拍的第一部影片，也是兰州厂的第一部故事片，厂子是新成立的，几个主要演员也是第一次上银幕，由于集体的努力，已经有了值得祝贺的成就。只要不断努力，刻苦奋斗，完全能够在实践中迅速得到发展，使作品水平不断提高。英雄的时代，要求有英雄笔墨来反映，让我们大家来共同奋斗吧。（附图片）
