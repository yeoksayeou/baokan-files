    Delivering Water Bailers at Night
    One day, the Gao Shi Management Area of the Huangguan Commune in Hanzhong City, Hanzhong Special District, Shaanxi Province, urgently needed fifty water bailers as water-lifting tools for drought resistance and rice transplanting. The commune members muttered to each other: What should we do? The Management Area called the Huangguan Store several times, requesting them to send someone to deliver them early the next morning. After receiving the call, the Party Branch of the store immediately sent cadre Wu Mingcai and others, carrying lanterns and the water bailers, towards the Gao Shi Management Area. When these water bailers were delivered to the production teams, more than eighty mu of autumn fields suffering from drought immediately received enough water. The commune members said: "No matter how big the drought demon is, we will surely be able to overcome it."

    夜送戽水斗
    一天，陕西汉中专区汉中市黄官公社高石管理区在抗旱插秧中急需提水工具——戽水斗五十个，社员们互相嘀咕着：这该咋办呀！管理区给黄官商店打了几次电话，请求他们明天一早派人送来。商店党支部接到了电话后，连夜派干部吴明才等打着灯笼，带着戽水斗，向高石管理区走去。当这些戽水斗送到各生产队后，八十多亩受旱的秋田，马上喝到了足够的水。社员们说：“再大的旱魔我们也一定能战胜它。”
