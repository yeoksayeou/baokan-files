　　Starry Night Assistance
　　Wuhan Iron and Steel Company　Guo Caifu
    Department Head Ma of the Party Committee's Organization Department was conveying the Party Committee's instructions to comrades about to go to work in the countryside. She said with seriousness and warmth, "It is our bounden duty to assist our farmer brothers in their work, and it is also a political task assigned to us by the Party. We are going with the sentiments of the 100,000 workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel..." Just then, messenger Xiao Wang suddenly burst in, interrupting Department Head Ma's words: "Department Head Ma, urgent telegram, from... from Yingshan County." Listening to Xiao Wang's panting words and looking at his sweaty face, everyone guessed that this must be a matter of extreme urgency. Department Head Ma hurriedly opened the telegram, and saw written beneath the red "Urgent" characters: "Two tractors at our county's reservoir construction site are broken and urgently need repair. Hoping for immediate assistance." After reading the telegram, Department Head Ma said to everyone, "See, the time we are needed has come! The commune's reservoir is waiting for us, our farmer brothers are waiting for us. The Party wants us to create miracles in industrial construction, and also wants us to make contributions in supporting agriculture..." Every word and every character of the urgent telegram, like rapid drumbeats, pounded in everyone's hearts....

    The Party Committee designated Wu Yunfei, the captain of the mechanical team, to lead five masters including Xiao Mingqing, Xu Axing, and Hong Huaxiang to rush to the Yingshan Reservoir construction site that very night.

    Night. Captain Wu and the others, carrying simple tools and materials, sat in the car, their hearts burning. The car sped forward at forty kilometers per hour, but everyone still felt it was too slow, wishing they could quickly get to Hankou Railway Station, transfer to the midnight train, and fly to the reservoir construction site to repair the tractors and put them into the battle against the flood. After getting on the train, in the crowded carriage, everyone began writing guarantees and challenges, six people writing twelve, one against the other, refusing to yield, as if they were competing in a martial arts contest on the construction site. How anxious their hearts were! Master Xiao and Master Xu took out their pliers to examine them for a while, then took out their sledgehammers to look at them, preparing to start working as soon as they arrived at the reservoir.

    When they arrived at the reservoir construction site, it was already dawn. The sun rose from the mountaintop, showering thousands of golden rays, plating the earth with a layer of gold. The reservoir construction site, bathed in the sunlight, was a hive of activity, with people shouting and horses neighing, and stone tampers rising and falling on the dam foundation, shaking the earth. After Captain Wu and the others inspected the tractors, they found the fault—the high-pressure oil pump was broken. They immediately launched a blitz, dismantling, cleaning, and repairing, the six of them going all out. In less than three hours, the tractors were repaired, the motors began to throb, and the two tractors were put back into construction.

    The tractors were repaired, but there were still many tasks to do. Many power machines such as motors, oil pumps, and water pumps in Chengguan, Guangshui, and Maping communes of Yingshan County were waiting to be repaired. Secretary Cai of the Reservoir Project Party Committee prepared to equip them with a few laborers and a flatbed cart to transport tools to various communes and production teams for repairs. When Secretary Cai asked everyone what else they needed, the six of them answered in unison: "We lack nothing, only a carrying pole!"

    Captain Wu and the six of them, relying on a single carrying pole, carried the tools from Chengguan to Maping, and from Maping to Guangshui, traveling back and forth between the various communes and production teams. Their clothes were soaked with sweat time and time again, and their hands grew more and more calluses, while agricultural machinery stood up, dancing and singing, and joined the ranks of agricultural construction.

    The six of them did not disappoint the Party's expectations. In forty days, their footprints covered the reservoir construction site and the production teams of various communes. They ignited the engines of every machine with the burning fire of youth in their hearts. At the celebration meeting for the completion of the Xiajiahe Reservoir, they gloriously received three banners and six medals.

　　星夜驰援
　　武汉钢铁公司　郭才福
    党委组织部马部长正对即将去农村工作的同志们传达党委的指示，她严肃而又和蔼地说道：“我们去协助农民兄弟工作，是义不容辞的义务，也是党交给我们的一项政治任务，我们是带着十万武钢职工的心意去的……”就在这时候，通讯员小王突然推门而入，打断了马部长的话：“马部长，加急电报，应……应山县打来的。”大家听着小王气喘吁吁的话，看着他满脸的热汗，都猜到这一定是十万火急的事。马部长急忙打开电报，只见在红色的“加急”二字下面写着：“我县水库工地二台拖拉机已坏，急需修理，盼火速支援。”看完电报，马部长对大家说：“看，需要我们的时候到了！公社水库正等着我们，农民兄弟正等着我们，党要我们在工业建设上创造奇迹，也要我们在支援农业上立下功劳……”每句话和加急电报的每一个字，像骤急的鼓点一样在大家心窝里敲响……。
    党委指定由机械队吴云飞队长带领萧明清、徐阿兴、洪华祥等五位师傅星夜赶往应山水库工地。
    夜。吴队长他们几个带着简单的工具和材料，坐在汽车上，心里火辣辣的。汽车以每小时四十公里的速度向前飞驰，但大伙还嫌汽车太慢，巴不得赶快到汉口车站，转乘午夜的火车，一下飞到水库工地去把拖拉机修好，投入治水的战斗。坐上火车以后，在拥挤的车厢里，大伙就写开保证书、挑战书了，六个人写了十二张，一个对一个，互不相让，好像在工地上打擂比武似的。他们的心多急啊！萧师傅和徐师傅一会儿把钳子拿出来看看，一会儿又把鎯头拿出来瞧瞧，准备一到水库就干起来。
    到了水库工地，天已大亮了。太阳从山顶上升起，洒下万道金光，给大地镀上了一层金色。沐浴在阳光下的水库工地，人声鼎沸，车马喧嚷，拦洪大坝坝基上，石夯一起一落，震得大地发抖。吴队长他们几个检查了拖拉机之后，找出了故障——高压油泵坏了，随即展开了突击战，拆卸的拆卸，清洗的清洗，修理的修理，六个人全力以赴的抢修。还不到三个小时，拖拉机修好了，马达开始跳动了，两台拖拉机又投入了施工。
    拖拉机修好了，但任务还很多，应山县城关、广水、马坪各公社还有很多马达、油泵、水泵等动力机械等待修复。水库工程党委蔡书记准备给他们配备几个民工和一辆板车运工具，到各公社和生产队去修理。当蔡书记问大伙还缺什么东西时，他们六个人同声答道：“什么都不缺，只缺一根扁担！”
    吴队长他们六个人，就凭着一条扁担，把工具从城关挑到马坪，又从马坪挑到广水，就这样往返于各个公社和各个生产队，衣服一次又一次的被汗水浇湿，手上增添着一颗颗硬茧，而一台台农业机械也都站了起来，跳着、唱着，走进了农业建设大军的行列。
    他们六个人没有辜负党对他们的期望，四十天里，足迹布满了水库工地和各公社的生产队，他们用心中的青春热火点燃了每台机器的发动机。在夏家河水库完工的庆功大会上，他们光荣获得了三面锦旗和六颗奖章。
