Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, Washington: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba pointed out at a press conference in Washington yesterday that the UN forces in the Congo have not only failed to quickly and effectively complete the tasks they were charged with and stop the aggressive atrocities of the Belgian army, but on the contrary, these UN forces are disarming Congolese soldiers.

Lumumba cited telegrams from his cabinet members to him to illustrate this situation.

Lumumba concluded his visit to Washington yesterday and is scheduled to depart for Canada on the morning of the 29th local time for a short visit. At a farewell press conference held last night, when talking about the current situation in the Congo, he pointed out that the Belgian army is "continuing to take aggressive actions in the Congo, despite the presence of UN troops."

At the meeting, Lumumba read out some telegrams he had received from other Congolese government leaders in Leopoldville. These telegrams pointed out that the domestic situation in the Congo is still very tense, property is being destroyed and stolen, and the people of the Congo are continuing to suffer large-scale harm from the Belgian army throughout the country. The telegram from Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga read by Lumumba said, "We have just learned that the Belgian army has carried out new aggression in Kolwezi. Fifty Congolese and two Europeans have died as a result of the bombing of this settlement by Belgian colonialists. I have requested the UN Deputy Secretary-General Bunch to send UN troops there quickly. But he has not yet satisfied this request."

Another telegram cited that 109 Congolese soldiers were killed by the Belgian army in Katanga Province, and "several thousand civilians were also killed."

Lumumba stated, "I reiterate that the Belgian army must withdraw from the Congo, otherwise our people may legitimately exercise their right to rise up and resist the Belgian army when they can no longer tolerate it."

Lumumba said that he had informed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld of his anxiety. He also told reporters that the Congolese Minister of Justice had made an urgent request to Hammarskjöld, hoping that the United States or other countries would immediately send troops to the Congo to "save the situation." Lumumba said that he personally has no objection to the entry of the United States or any other country's troops into the Congo. He said, "What I hope is that thousands of troops will be sent immediately so that the Belgian army can withdraw immediately."

Lumumba once again condemned the colonialists' conspiracy to divide the Congo by creating Katanga Province's "independence" through their agent, Tshombe. He said, "All we ask for is a unified country."

Lumumba reiterated that the Congo "will not accept any assistance with ulterior motives."

Lumumba expressed "satisfaction" with the talks held in the United States. He said he believed that the US government would help get the Belgian army out of the Congo.

Lumumba said that the Congo "will become a democratic country like the United States. We are proud that we are among the free countries that uphold freedom."

Before holding the press conference yesterday, Lumumba met with World Bank President Black to discuss the possibility and ways for the Congo to join the bank. After meeting with Black for an hour, Lumumba was received by Cochran, Assistant to the President of the International Monetary Fund.

    卢蒙巴在美国招待记者
    指出联合国部队没有制止比利时的侵略
    表示不反对美国或其他国家派兵去刚果
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴昨天在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上指出，在刚果的联合国部队不仅没有迅速而有效地完成它所负担的任务和制止比利时军队的侵略暴行，相反地，这些联合国部队却在解除刚果士兵的武装。
    卢蒙巴引述他的内阁阁员给他的电报说明了这种情况。
    卢蒙巴昨天结束了在华盛顿的访问，并且预定在当地时间29日上午动身赴加拿大作短期访问。他在昨天晚上举行的告别记者招待会上谈到刚果目前的局势时指出，比利时军队正在刚果“继续采取侵略行动，尽管联合国军队呆在那里”。
    卢蒙巴在会上宣读了他收到的刚果政府其他领导人从利奥波德维尔打给他的一些电报。这些电报中指出，目前刚果国内形势仍然十分紧张，财产被破坏盗窃，刚果各地人民继续受到比利时军队的大规模残害。卢蒙巴宣读的刚果副总理基赞加的电报中说“我们刚刚知道，比利时军队在科耳威济地方进行了新的侵略。由于比利时殖民主义者对这个居民点进行了轰炸，有五十名刚果人和两名欧洲人死亡。我已经请求联合国副秘书长本奇往那里迅速派联合国军队。但是他至今没有满足这项请求。”
    另一封电报中举出，在加丹加省有一百零九名刚果士兵遭到比利时军队杀害，另外还有“好几千平民遭到杀害”。
    卢蒙巴声明说，“我再次坚持比利时军队必须撤离刚果，否则我们的人民在忍无可忍时可能正当地行使他们的权利，起来反抗比利时军队。”
    卢蒙巴说，他已经把他的焦虑心情通知了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。他并且告诉记者说，刚果的司法部长已经向哈马舍尔德提出紧急要求，希望立即派遣美国或其他国家的军队到刚果去“挽救局势”。卢蒙巴表示，他个人一点也不反对美国或者任何其他国家军队进入刚果。他说，“我希望的是立即派去数以千计的军队，以便使比利时军队可以立即撤退。”
    卢蒙巴再次谴责殖民主义者通过它们的代理人冲伯制造加丹加省“独立”以分割刚果的阴谋。他说，“我们要求的只是一个统一的国家”。
    卢蒙巴重申，刚果“将不接受任何附带不可告人的动机的援助”。
    卢蒙巴对在美国举行的会谈表示“满意”。他说，他相信美国政府会帮助使比利时军队撤出刚果。
    卢蒙巴说，刚果“将成为一个像美国这样的民主国家。我们对于我们置身于拥护自由的自由国家之列而感到骄傲”。
    昨天在举行记者招待会之前，卢蒙巴会见了世界银行行长布莱克，同他讨论了刚果参加这个银行的可能性和办法。在同布莱克会谈了一小时之后，卢蒙巴又在国际货币基金组织部受到该组织会长助理柯克伦的接待。
