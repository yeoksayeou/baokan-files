    Continue to Develop "Factory-Commune Hookup"

    Since the end of last year, many provinces and cities have used the "factory-commune hookup" method as an important part of industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas. "Factory-commune hookup" has achieved good results in many places. Today's reports in this newspaper on the "factory-commune hookup" in Liaoning, Anhui, Shanghai, Harbin and other provinces and cities fully demonstrate that "factory-commune hookup" is indeed a good method for promoting agricultural technological transformation. This method has seen new developments in many places, such as urban communes hooking up with counties, urban districts hooking up with counties, and various industries hooking up with rural communes. In short, it is a great scene of worker-peasant collaboration and urban-rural collaboration.

    Since December of last year, Liaoning Province has organized major factories and mines throughout the province to directly hook up with people's communes, adopting the method of fixed-point contracting and all-inclusive responsibility, providing comprehensive assistance to rural people's communes in terms of materials, technology, and other aspects. With the direct assistance of factories and mines, 427 agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants have been built in 460 rural people's communes throughout Liaoning Province. Industrial enterprises have also trained more than 9,000 technical workers for these plants. An agricultural machinery repair and assembly network has initially taken shape in rural Liaoning. In addition, factories have also helped rural communes build a number of small power stations, indigenous fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, small blast furnaces, and so on. However, Liaoning Province has not stopped at its existing achievements. Recently, on the basis of consolidating and improving this new form of worker-peasant alliance, factory-commune hookup, it has further developed "factory-commune hookup." Their approach is to use the original hookup factory as the main body, with key factories as group leaders, and then absorb units such as transportation, commerce and finance, culture and education, health, science and technology to form agricultural support cooperative committees to help rural people's communes realize agricultural technological transformation in a planned, organized, and led manner. These practices in Liaoning Province have greatly promoted the process of rural people's communes realizing agricultural technological transformation.

    The practice of Liaoning and other provinces and cities proves that factory-commune hookup is a new form with strong vitality for further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Through factory-commune hookup, the tasks, timing, methods, and steps for cities to support rural areas in realizing mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification are made concrete and institutionalized, and fixed in the form of contracts (agreements). This greatly strengthens the sense of responsibility of both factories and communes to strive to achieve agricultural technological transformation and unprecedentedly close the ties between workers and peasants.

    From the experience of Liaoning and other provinces and cities, where does the superiority of factory-commune hookup lie?

    First, factory-commune hookup better combines national industry (including provincial, municipal, and county local industries) with rural people's commune industries. Before the widespread establishment of factory-commune hookup relationships, because the support relationship was not fixed and industry did not understand the situation of agricultural production well enough, in addition to organizing manpower to go to the countryside to help with spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting during the busy farming season, the direction of support in other aspects was not very clear. Often, they did not know what kind of support would be best, and generally only focused on the material aspect. For example, some factories and mines simply sent some machine tools to the communes, while others donated books, medicines, and sports and cultural supplies. Although these were all beneficial forms of support, demonstrating the deep friendship between workers and peasants, this kind of gift-based support could not closely combine large-scale industry with commune-run industry to jointly strive for the urgent requirements of realizing agricultural modernization in a way that takes responsibility to the end. Some factories and mines, after sending machine tools to rural communes, found that the communes had no place to install them, or even if they had a place to install them, no one knew how to use them, and they were left idle. After the direct factory-commune hookup, this situation quickly changed. After clarifying their task as fundamentally helping agriculture realize technological transformation, the hookup factories and mines universally seized the central link of equipping rural commune agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plants, helping communes actively carry out tool reform movements centered on semi-mechanization, carrying out the comprehensive utilization of equipment, and helping communes train technical personnel, providing comprehensive assistance in all aspects. In this way, the task of national industrialization and the task of rural commune industrialization are closely combined, and the "two initiatives" (the initiative of cities to support rural areas and the initiative of rural areas to rely on their own efforts) are closely combined. This is a road to support agricultural technological transformation that is faster, better, and more economical. Obviously, without this fixed and long-term support relationship of factory-commune hookup, this kind of combination could not be achieved well.

    Second, factory-commune hookup helps to better implement the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." Before factory-commune hookup, due to the vast difference in technical foundations between workers and peasants, the contradiction between improving and popularizing was more prominent. On the one hand, there were the most modern tractors, and on the other hand, there were the oldest bent-handle plows; on the one hand, there were demands for mechanization, automation, and electrification, and on the other hand, work was still done with the same two hands. The masses put it well: it was either all indigenous or all foreign. After factory-commune hookup, these two forces began to be twisted together. Factories and mines actively participated in the commune's tool reform movement centered on semi-mechanization, enthusiastically proceeding from the specific conditions of the local area, from the production practice of the peasants, adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times, gradually solving the problem of improvement on the basis of popularization. This year, various highly efficient improved farm tools in many rural communes were manufactured by commune-run industries with the strong support of hookup factories. For example, the manure spreaders of the Piziwo Commune in Dalian originally had three wheels, with the front wheel unable to turn, making them very awkward to use. With the help of workers from the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, they were changed to a turntable, making them more convenient to use. In the past, the construction of power stations, which rural communes considered very mysterious, was made simple with the help of workers, using the construction site as a classroom and real objects as teaching materials, doing and teaching at the same time. Finally, "the power station was built, and the technology was learned," and the technical strength for rural power generation was also cultivated at the same time. Today, we can see examples of this high-speed training of peasant technical teams everywhere. If indigenous power stations can be built, then indigenous railways, indigenous locomotives, indigenous tractors ("long-legged" diesel engines), etc., can of course also be built. An important condition here is to combine foreign and indigenous methods, combine workers and peasants, and cooperate for a long time. In the past, before factories and communes were directly hooked up, there were relatively few examples of this combination of foreign and indigenous methods. After the widespread hookup of factories and communes, we see that this combination of foreign and indigenous methods is not only incomparably larger in scale than in the past, but also greatly improved in the quality of the combination. It can be expected that with the deepening of the factory-commune hookup work, the power of combining foreign and indigenous methods, with workers and peasants working together to march toward agricultural modernization, will be further demonstrated.

    Third, through factory-commune hookup, industrial enterprises can better understand the fundamental and long-term issues of agricultural technological transformation and the urgent problems in current agricultural production, making industrial support for agriculture work more solid and timely. Before factory-commune hookup, some enterprises and units, because they did not fully understand the specific situation of agricultural production and did not distinguish between long-term needs and immediate urgent requirements, although they provided support with good intentions, the effect was not good. For example, some transportation units, in order to support agriculture, enthusiastically proposed to help communes repair roads, took the initiative to do surveying and design for communes, and guided communes in construction, only requiring communes to provide labor. This was certainly a great thing, but they did not understand that the commune was in the middle of the busy farming season at that time, and labor was extremely scarce. Therefore, the commune did not welcome this kind of support, which is called not knowing the actual situation and providing assistance at the wrong time. After factory-commune hookup, this type of phenomenon generally no longer occurs. Now, it is a matter of both grasping the fundamentals and curing the immediate urgency. For example, after factory-commune hookup in Shenyang City, in addition to sending people to help communes establish agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants, they also sent people to the countryside to help repair farm tools during the preparation for farming according to seasonal needs, and mobilized workers to go to the countryside to help with rush sowing during spring plowing. Recently, they have also organized workers to go to the countryside to kill insects and weed. The peasant masses said with satisfaction: The city's support for the countryside is like "timely rain," coming whenever it is needed.

    Industrial support for agriculture is both a blitzkrieg campaign and a long-term task. Combining blitzkrieg work with regular work, so that communes can realize agricultural modernization in a planned and step-by-step manner with the support of hookup factories and mines, is the common task of both the supporting unit and the supported unit. Before factory-commune hookup, the situation of urban support for communes was generally short-term but not long-term, and material support was mostly about giving but not caring about using. This could not continuously and effectively maximize the role of human and material support. After factory-commune hookup, many factories and communes have jointly formulated long-term plans and phased action plans (agreements) on how to achieve agricultural "four modernizations" on the basis of a considerable understanding of each other. This further mobilizes the enthusiasm of both the supporting party and the supported party, fundamentally changing the past situation of supporting agriculture in a piecemeal and unplanned manner. Factory-commune hookup also has a mutually promoting effect. For agriculture, it is necessary to further promote the spirit of self-reliance and not rely solely on external support. For industry, when formulating its annual and quarterly plans, it is also necessary to fully consider how to tap the potential within the industry in order to support agriculture more and better. In this way, the task of industrialization and the task of supporting agricultural technological transformation are further connected, and the two sides borrow "east wind" from each other and promote each other.

    In short, factory-commune hookup has opened up a broad road for industrial support for agriculture, and all localities and all enterprises should do this work better. Factory-commune hookup is a very good organizational form for the two major classes of workers and peasants to jointly realize the tasks of national industrialization and agricultural modernization, and it is an activity of great political significance in our economic life today. We should cherish this great creation of the working class and peasant masses under the leadership of the Party, and in our future work, we should continue to support it, develop it, and use it more consciously, so that the content and form of factory-commune hookup become more rich and colorful, and that it plays a greater role in the great historical tasks of further consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance, accelerating agricultural technological transformation, and continuously narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas.

    继续发展“厂社挂钩”
    从去年年末以来，许多省市都运用了“厂社挂钩”的方法，作为工业支援农业、城市支援农村的一个重要内容。“厂社挂钩”在许多地方都取得了很好的效果，今天本报发表的辽宁、安徽、上海、哈尔滨等省市的“厂社挂钩”的报道，充分表明了“厂社挂钩”确是促进农业技术改造的一个好方法。这个方法在许多地方又有了新的发展，如城市公社和县挂钩、城市的区和县挂钩、各行各业和农村公社挂钩等等，总之是一派工农协作、城乡协作的大好气象。
    辽宁省从去年12月开始，组织了全省主要厂矿企业同人民公社直接挂钩，采取定点包干、一包到底的办法，在物资上，技术上和其他方面给了农村人民公社全面帮助。在厂矿企业直接帮助下，辽宁全省四百六十个农村人民公社，建起了四百二十七处农业机具修配厂，工业企业并且代这些厂培训了各种技术工人九千多名，农业机具修配网在辽宁农村已初步形成了。此外工厂还帮助农村公社建设了一批小型发电站、土化肥厂、农药厂、小高炉等等。但辽宁省并没有停止在已有的成就前面，最近，在巩固、提高厂社挂钩这一工农联盟新形式的基础上，又进一步发展了“厂社挂钩”。他们的做法是，以原挂钩厂为主，骨干厂为组长，再吸收交通运输、商业金融、文教卫生、科学技术等单位参加，组成支援农业的合作委员会，帮助农村人民公社有计划、有组织、有领导地实现农业技术改造。辽宁省的这些做法，大大促进了农村人民公社实现农业技术改造的进程。
    辽宁等省市的实践证明：厂社挂钩是进一步加强工农联盟的具有强大生命力的新形式。通过厂社挂钩，使得城市支援农村实现机械化、水利化、电气化的任务，和实现这些任务的时间、方法、步骤都具体化、制度化了，并且用合同（协议书）的形式固定下来，这样就大大加强了厂社双方努力实现农业技术改造的责任感，空前地密切了工农双方的联系。
    从辽宁等省市的经验来看，厂社挂钩的优越性表现在那些地方呢？
    第一、厂社挂钩把国家工业（包括省、市、县的地方工业）和农村人民公社工业更好地结合起来了。在厂社没有普遍建立挂钩关系以前，由于支援的关系不固定，加上工业对农业生产的情况了解得不够，除了农忙时组织人力下乡帮助春耕、夏锄、秋收以外，在其它方面，支援的方向就不很明确，往往不知道支援什么好，一般只从物质一个方面着眼。比如，有些厂矿只单纯给公社送一些机床，有些厂矿赠送了图书、医药、体育文化用品等等。这些，虽然也都是一些有益的支援，表现了工农的深厚友谊，但是，这种馈赠性质的支援，还不能做到大工业和社办工业密切结合起来，一包到底地共同为实现农业现代化的迫切要求而努力。有的厂矿把机床送到农村公社后，公社没有地方安装，或者虽有地方安装，也没有人会使用，放在那里闲着。厂社直接挂钩以后，这种情况很快地改变了。挂钩厂矿在明确了自己的任务是从根本上帮助农业实现技术改造以后，就普遍抓住了武装农村公社农具修配制造厂这个中心环节，帮助公社积极开展以半机械化为中心的工具改革运动，开展设备的综合利用，并帮助公社培训技术力量，从各个方面进行全面的援助。这样，就使得国家工业化的任务和农村公社工业化的任务密切地结合起来了，使得“两个积极性”（城市支援农村的积极性和农村自力更生的积极性）密切结合起来了，这是一条支援农业技术改造的多快好省的道路。显然，没有厂社挂钩这种固定的、长期的支援关系，就不能很好地做到这种结合。
    第二、厂社挂钩有助于更好地贯彻“土洋并举”的方针。厂社挂钩以前，由于工农技术基础相差悬殊，提高和普及的矛盾比较突出。一方面是最新式的拖拉机，一方面是最古老的弯把犁；一方面要求机械化、自动化、电气化，一方面干起活来还是照旧两只手。群众说得好：不是一个劲的土，就是一个劲的洋。厂社挂钩以后，开始把这两股劲拧到一块来了。厂矿方面，积极地参加了公社以半机械化为中心的工具改革运动，热情地从当地的具体条件出发，从农民的生产实践出发，因地制宜、因时制宜，在普及的基础上逐步地解决提高的问题。今年许多农村公社的各种效率相当高的改良农具，就是在挂钩厂的大力支援下，由社办工业赶制出来的。如大连皮子窝公社原来的摅粪机是三个轮子，前轮不能转，用起来很别扭，经大连机车车辆厂的工人下乡帮助改为转盘的，使用起来就方便了。过去农村公社认为很神秘的电站建设工作，在工人们的帮助下，以工地为课堂，以实物为教材，一面做，一面教，最后“电站建成，技术学会”，农村办电的技术力量也同时培养出来了。今天我们到处可以看到这种高速度培养农民技术队伍的事例。土电站能办，土铁路、土机车、土拖拉机（柴油机“长腿”）等等当然也都能办。这里一个重要条件，就是要洋土结合、工农结合，长期合作。在过去厂社未曾直接挂钩以前，这种洋土结合的范例，还是比较少的；厂社普遍挂钩以后，我们看到，这种洋土结合不但在规模上比过去无可比拟地扩大了，而且在结合的质量上，也比过去大为提高了。可以预期，随着厂社挂钩工作的深入开展，洋土结合，工农携手，向农业现代化进军的威力，将会进一步表现出来。
    第三、通过厂社挂钩可以更好地使工业企业了解农业技术改造的根本的长远的问题和眼前农业生产中的迫切问题，使工业支援农业的工作做得更踏实更及时。在厂社挂钩之前，某些企业单位就是由于不十分了解农业生产的具体情况，没有分清长远的需要和眼前的迫切要求，虽然好心支援，效果反而不好。比如有的交通运输单位为了支援农业，热心地提出要帮助公社修公路，主动地为公社做好勘察设计，并指导公社施工，只要求公社出人工；这当然是一件大好事情，但是他们不了解公社当时正是农忙，劳力极缺，因而公社并不欢迎这种支援，这叫做不知实际，援非其时。在厂社挂钩之后，这一类现象一般地就不再发生了。现在是既抓住了本，又治了急。如沈阳市在厂社挂钩以后，除了派人帮助公社建立农业机械修配厂以外，又根据季节需要，在备耕时派人下乡帮助检修农具，春耕时动员职工下乡帮助突击播种。最近又组织职工下乡灭虫、除草。农民群众满意地说：城市对农村的支援真像“及时雨”一样，想要就来。
    工业支援农业，既是一个突击性的运动，又是一个长期性的任务。把突击工作和经常工作结合起来，使公社能够在挂钩厂矿的支援下，有计划、有步骤地实现农业现代化，这是支援单位和被支援单位双方的共同任务。厂社挂钩以前，城市对公社的支援情况，一般是有短（期）无长（期），物资支援也多半是只管给，不管用，这样就不能持续有效地和最大限度地发挥人力、物力支援的作用。厂社挂钩以后，许多厂社之间已经在彼此都有相当了解的基础上，共同制订了如何实现农业“四化”的长远规划和分期行动计划（协议书）。这就把支援一方和被支援一方的积极性都进一步调动起来，从根本上改变了过去支援农业零敲碎打、没有长期规划的状况。厂社挂钩，还有相互促进作用，对农业来说，要更加发扬自力更生的精神，不要单纯依赖外力支援。对工业来说，在订立自己的年度、季度计划的时候，也要充分考虑到如何挖掘工业内部的潜力，以便更多更好地支援农业。这样，就把工业化的任务和支援农业技术改造的任务进一步衔接起来，双方互借“东风”，互相促进。
    总之，厂社挂钩为工业支援农业开辟了一条广阔的道路，所有地方、所有企业都应当把这个工作做得更好。厂社挂钩是工农两大阶级共同携手实现国家工业化和农业现代化任务的一个很好的组织形式，是我们今天的经济生活中有重大政治意义的活动。我们应当十分珍视在党的领导下工农群众的这个伟大创造，在今后工作中不断地扶植它、发展它、更加自觉地运用它，使厂社挂钩的内容和形式更加丰富多采，使它在进一步巩固和发展工农联盟、加速农业技术改造、以及不断缩小城乡差别的伟大历史任务中，发挥更大的作用。
