　　"The Flying Dragon Gets Married"
　　Our Correspondent in Shanghai
    A story called "The Flying Dragon Gets Married" has been widely circulating among the people of Shanghai recently. It demonstrates the noble spirit of Shanghai workers of being selfless for the sake of socialist construction.
    The story is as follows: The workers of the Shanghai Xiangtai Can Factory sent an automatic can-making combined machine that they had successfully trial-produced to its sister factory, the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory, to be matched with the factory's automatic cold cream filling machine, forming an automated production line for producing "Pehchaolin" cold cream.
    The automatic can-making combined machine successfully trial-produced by the Xiangtai Can Factory can produce iron boxes from the back as long as one person puts the whole sheet of iron in the front of the machine. The automatic cold cream filling machine successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory will automatically fill, automatically scrape, automatically apply tin foil, and automatically cover the box as long as the finished iron boxes are put into the hopper.
    After these two automatic machines were made in the two factories, although they both improved production and quality, there were still shortcomings. The Xiangtai Factory still had to wrap nearly ten thousand dozens of iron box bottoms and lids with oiled paper every day, pack them into more than one hundred large boxes, and transport them to the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory by car. After receiving the boxes, the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory had to unpack them. This required a lot of packaging materials and transportation capacity, and if too much was sent, there was no place to store it, and if too little was sent, the supply could not meet the demand, which made both parties very difficult. The workers of the two factories were all discussing how to make these two machines into a complete production line.
    Gu Bolong, a 44-year-old veteran worker and one of the main manufacturers of the automatic can-making combined machine, said: "We engage in innovation, neither for fame nor for profit. Sending the automatic can-making combined machine to the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory to form a complete set will allow the technical revolution to show its great power." Lu Guisheng, a shearing worker, said: "We have only one purpose in production: for socialist construction, we must proceed from this fundamental purpose, regardless of whether it is beneficial or not." Everyone agreed that combining the two machines into an automated production line had three major benefits: first, current production could be greatly improved; second, the expenses and labor spent on transportation could be greatly reduced; third, it would be even more beneficial in the long run for the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory to become an all-round factory.
    The suggestion of the Xiangtai Factory workers to send out the automatic can-making combined machine was agreed and supported by the leadership. They did what they said, and together they dismantled the machine happily, wiped it clean, selected a technical team headed by Master Gu Bolong, sent it to the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory, and helped with the installation, helping the workers there master the operation technology of the can-making machine.
    The noble style of the Xiangtai Factory workers was warmly praised and welcomed by the workers of the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory. The Party Branch Secretary and the Factory Director led all the workers to gather at the gate, beating gongs and drums to welcome the technical team from the Xiangtai Factory who came to deliver the "treasure." After twenty days of joint efforts by the workers of the two factories, the two automatic machines were connected. The realization of the automation of cold cream production not only increased the output by more than five times, greatly reduced the labor intensity, and improved the quality, but also saved transportation costs. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers of the No. 2 Daily Chemical Factory, and a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution was set off throughout the factory.
    After the workers of the Xiangtai Factory sent away the automatic can-making combined machine, they made a ambitious plan: to continue to manufacture this kind of machine, make one and send one, so that all daily chemical factories would become fully automated factories like the No. 2 Factory. At the same time, they actively opened up new production avenues, such as producing light bulb screw bases, perfume bottle caps, hygrometers, pupa killers, etc., to provide the country with a large number of urgently needed products.
    The communist style of selflessness of the Xiangtai Factory has aroused a huge response in factories and workers throughout the city. The Jiamei Can Factory, which has the same production tasks as the Xiangtai Factory, is determined to learn from the Xiangtai Factory and also send its innovated automatic can-making machine to its sister factory that produces daily chemical products. The family industrial cooperatives needed this kind of machine, but did not have an automatic packaging machine to match it, so the factory concentrated more than 20 workers to trial-produce this machine, and it has now achieved initial success. The workers of the Shanghai Grease Chemical Machinery Factory, who have always specialized in serving daily chemical factories, said that the Xiangtai Factory is not a machinery factory, but made machines and sent them to others, so we machinery factories should do this even more. The bakelite press of the Xinde Hose Factory was broken and sent to this machinery factory for repair. It happened that the sand casting furnace was shut down due to some reason, so the workers took the parts to fraternal factories for processing, so that the machines of the Xinde Factory were quickly put into production.

### “飞龙出嫁”

　　“飞龙出嫁”
　　本报驻上海记者
    一个被称为“飞龙出嫁”的故事，最近在上海人民中广泛流传着。它显示了上海工人在社会主义建设中舍己为人的崇高风格。
    这个故事是这样的：上海祥泰制罐厂职工将自己试制成功的一台自动制罐联合机，送给了它的姊妹厂日用化学品二厂，同这个厂的一台冷霜自动灌装机配起套来，成为生产“百雀羚”冷霜的一条自动化生产线。
    祥泰制罐厂试制成功的自动化制罐联合机，只要一个人在机器前面把整张铁皮送进去，铁盒子就能从后面流出来。上海日用化学品二厂试制成功的冷霜自动灌装机，只要把制好的铁盒子放进斗里，它就会自动装料、自动刮平，自动贴锡纸、自动盖盒盖。
    这两台自动机在两个厂制成以后，虽然都提高了产量和质量，但仍有美中不足之处。祥泰厂每天仍然要把近万打铁盒子底盘和盖头用油纸包好，装进一百多只大箱子，用汽车运到日用化学品二厂去。日用化学品二厂接到箱子后，又要开箱拆包。这样，要花费很多包装材料和运力，而且送多了堆放不下，送少了供不应求，使双方都很为难。两个厂的职工就都议论着要把这两台机器配成一条龙。
    自动制罐联合机的主要制造者之一、四十四岁的老工人顾伯龙说：“我们搞革新，一不为名，二不为利，自动制罐联合机送给日用化学品二厂配成套，技术革命可以大显威风。”剪板工人陆桂生说：“我们搞生产只有一个目的：为了社会主义建设，有利无利都要从这个根本目的出发。”大家一致认为，两套机器合成一条自动化生产线有三大好处：第一、当前的生产可以大大提高；第二、花在运输上的费用和劳动可以大大减少；第三、日用化学品二厂变成全能厂，从长远来看，更是有利。
    祥泰厂工人要把自动制罐联合机送出去的建议，得到了领导上的同意和支持。他们说干就干，一齐动手，欢天喜地地把机器拆下来，擦得雪亮，选派了一个以顾伯龙师傅为首的技术小组把它送到日用化学品二厂，并帮助安装，帮助那里的工人兄弟掌握制罐机的操作技术。
    祥泰厂工人的崇高风格，受到了日用化学品二厂工人们的热烈赞扬和欢迎。党支部书记、厂长带领全厂工人拥在门口，敲锣打鼓，迎接祥泰厂送“宝”来的技术小组。经过两厂工人二十天的协力奋战，两台自动机联接起来了。冷霜生产自动化的实现，不仅使产量提高五倍以上，劳动强度大大减轻，质量提高，而且节约了运输费用。这件事情大大鼓舞了日用化学品二厂职工的干劲，全厂掀起了技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。
    祥泰厂工人把自动制罐联合机送走以后，又立下雄心大志：要继续制造这种机器，做好一台送走一台，使所有的日用化学品工厂都像二厂一样，成为全盘联动化的工厂。同时，他们自己积极开辟新的生产门路，如生产灯泡螺丝蒂头、香水精瓶盖、干湿器、杀蛹器等，为国家提供大量迫切需要的产品。
    祥泰厂舍己为人的共产主义风格，在全市工厂和工人中引起了巨大的反响。跟祥泰厂生产任务相同的嘉美制罐厂，决心向祥泰厂学习，也把自己革新成功的自动制罐机送给生产日用化学品的姊妹厂用。家庭工业社需要这种机器，但没有自动包装机跟它配套，这个厂就集中二十多个工人试制这种机器，现已获得初步成功。一向专门为日用化学品工厂服务的上海油脂化学机器厂的职工说，祥泰厂不是机器厂，造了机器送给人家，我们机器厂更应该这样做。信德软管厂胶木压机坏了，送到这个机器厂修理，正赶上翻砂炉因故停开，工人们就把机件拿到兄弟工厂去加工，使信德厂的机器迅速投入了生产。
