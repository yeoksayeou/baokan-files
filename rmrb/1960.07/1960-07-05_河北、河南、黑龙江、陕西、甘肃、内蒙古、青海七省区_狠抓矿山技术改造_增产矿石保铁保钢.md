Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 4th: Hebei Province's small and medium-sized iron mines are actively carrying out technical transformation to promote an overall leap forward in production. As of now, eight iron mines in the province, including Sijiaying, Kuangshancun, Cishan, Zhangzhuang, Sifangtai, and Zhuoxian, have completed their half-year or full-year ore production plans ahead of schedule. From January to mid-June, the province's ore production increased by 41% compared with the same period last year; overall efficiency increased nearly twofold compared with last year; and costs decreased by about 30% compared with last year. At the same time, the ore grade of most mines has also increased to over 40% to 50%.

In the technical transformation of mines, Hebei Province has adhered to the principle of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradual improvement. From the province to the city, county, and iron mine, they have formulated transformation plans at each level, focusing on key production aspects such as loading, transportation, mining, and excavation. They have also adopted a method of phased and concentrated efforts to complete tasks within a limited time. By the end of June, in just over three months, mines across the province had imitated and created more than 500 hand-operated and foot-operated drilling machines, local electric drills, and other rock drilling machinery, more than 1,800 various mine cars and local electric locomotive transportation tools, and built more than 400 kilometers of transportation tracks and aerial ropeways.

In order to ensure the continuous leap forward in ore production, while accelerating the technical transformation of mines, various localities have also vigorously grasped mine geological exploration and production preparation work. Now, many cities, counties, and mines have established and strengthened geological exploration forces and established specialized rock stripping and tunneling teams, basically ensuring the normal connection between mining and tunneling.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 4th: Henan Province is vigorously grasping the comprehensive technical transformation of mines, focusing on iron ore mines, so that more than 60 county-run and above small and medium-sized mines are rapidly moving towards the goal of modern mining enterprises; a new situation of rising ore production has emerged.

In the process of mine technical transformation, various localities have conscientiously implemented the Henan Provincial Party Committee's policy of "simultaneous technical transformation and current production, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small mines." A new atmosphere of "everywhere engaged in innovation, every mine changing its appearance" has emerged everywhere. The first batch of key mines to be transformed has been armed with generators, boiler-locomotives, gas engines, winches, and other modern equipment. Many mines have universally created and used various types of local machines such as local mine cars, local winches, and local drilling machines, thus basically eliminating heavy manual labor such as carrying on the back and using hand hammers to drill holes.

While transforming mines, various localities have also universally strengthened geological exploration in order to clarify mine resources. In the past few months, various localities have adopted a method of combining professional teams and mass exploration, and have submitted 20 geological reports, proving 46 million tons of ore.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 4th: Leading cadres at all levels of the steel front in Heilongjiang Province personally went to the mines and vigorously grasped mining and ore transportation, so that the province's ore mining volume and daily transportation volume increased significantly. Comparing mid-June with early June, the average daily mining volume increased by 43%, and the daily ore transportation volume increased by 31%; comparing the first five days of late June with the last five days of mid-June, the average daily mining volume increased by another 80%; and the daily transportation volume increased by about one-fold.

Since entering June, there has been continuous rain in various parts of Heilongjiang Province. Some mine pit entrances were flooded, and some ore transportation lines were washed out by rain, affecting ore mining and transportation. In order to overcome the rainy season, party committees at all levels and leading cadres on the steel front worked with the masses to jointly study ways to overcome difficulties. In order to ensure the smooth flow of ore transportation, Zhao Song, secretary of the Bin County Party Committee, personally went to the Bin-Ha Highway site and participated in labor with more than 4,000 workers, farmers, students, and government cadres who were repairing the highway, promptly solving problems and ensuring the rapid repair of the Bin-Ha Highway, ensuring the transportation of iron ore.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 4th: Employees of small iron mines in Shaanxi Province timely summarize and promote advanced experience in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, strengthen the technical transformation of mines, improve mining, excavation, and transportation efficiency and ore quality, and ensure that small blast furnaces throughout the province are well-fed and fed well.

Since the beginning of this year, relevant departments in Shaanxi Province have successively held two on-site meetings on mine technical innovation, timely summarizing and promoting the experience of technical innovation in small mines throughout the province, which has played a significant role in promoting the production and technical transformation of small mines throughout the province. In the technical innovation movement, the Yudongzi Iron Mine made a curved drilling machine, which increased the efficiency of tunnel excavation by 2.5 times; the Baishuijiang Iron Mine used local methods to make a semi-automatic aerial transportation ropeway, which generally increased transportation and loading and unloading efficiency by about nine times. These experiences have now been promoted in mines throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 4th: The metallurgical departments in Gansu Province are vigorously grasping the technical transformation of small and medium-sized iron mines, so that the output of iron ore is steadily increasing, which has powerfully promoted the continued leap forward in steel production.

In carrying out the technical transformation of iron ore mines, Gansu Province conscientiously implements the principle of "self-reliance and gradual improvement," focusing on weak links such as mining, excavation, loading, and transportation. So far, nine key small and medium-sized iron mines in the province have achieved local mechanization in drilling, mining, and loading, basically eliminating heavy manual labor such as hand drilling and carrying on the back, greatly improving labor productivity.

In order to improve the grade of ore entering the furnace, increase pig iron production, and reduce raw material consumption and costs, Gansu Province has also trial-operated a small concentrator at the Hexibao Iron Factory. After completion, it can process ore from ten mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 4th: Employees of various mines in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region vigorously carry out mine technical transformation, and production efficiency has increased many times over. Many mines have completed their plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule.

In the technical transformation of local iron mines in the autonomous region, leading cadres in various mining areas of the autonomous region personally took charge and adopted the method of self-reliance and using local methods. They went to the mines and construction sites, specifically looking for key production areas and weak links, and took the lead in making innovations. According to statistics from seventeen mines in Zhaowuda League, there are more than 1,000 kinds of innovation machinery, and more than 20 single-line aerial ropeways and circulating ropeways have been erected. More than 20 wooden rails and light rails have also been laid, allowing more than 3,000 workers to abandon sledgehammers, iron shovels, and large baskets, and get rid of shoulder pads, increasing labor efficiency by more than 30 times.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 4th: The steel smelting departments in Qinghai Province are vigorously grasping the mining industry and actively carrying out technical transformation of small and medium-sized iron mines. The output of iron ore in June increased by about one-fold compared with May.

While Qinghai Province's iron ore mines are doing everything possible to increase ore production, they are also paying attention to improving the quality of the ore. In addition to selecting rich ore for mining, they also pay attention to selection. Some mines have carried out iron sieve water selection, so that the grade of iron ore has increased from 30% to over 45%.

In order to further strengthen mine mining work, Qinghai Province recently held a mine work conference, focusing on studying the strengthening of the Party's leadership in mines, as well as mine transformation and construction issues. (Attached picture)
