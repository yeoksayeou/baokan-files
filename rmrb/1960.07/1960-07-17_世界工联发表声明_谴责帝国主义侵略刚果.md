    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 15th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement here on the 15th, strongly condemning the imperialist aggression against the Republic of the Congo and demanding the withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo. The statement called for full respect for the territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo.
    In its statement, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions called on all workers and trade union organizations in Africa and around the world to unite in support of the Congolese people's just struggle against colonialism and imperialism, and to express their solidarity with and full support for the Congolese people in various forms. The statement said that the united action of the Congolese people and the active solidarity of the international working class would defeat the sinister actions of the colonialists and imperialists, thereby guaranteeing the final victory of the Congolese people in their struggle for independence.
    The statement pointed out that the imperialist forces are invading the newly independent Republic of the Congo in an attempt to continue plundering the Congo's wealth and at the same time obstruct the irresistible liberation movement that is currently sweeping across the African continent. However, imperialism will not succeed. The statement said: "No force in the world can stop the African people's victorious march towards complete freedom and independence."
