Idealistic Pragmatist
    Lin Xu
    People often use the most affectionate and beautiful words to describe those model grassroots cadres: "Intimate Secretary," "Leading Captain," "Reliable Director," "Sure Accountant," and so on. These secretaries, captains, directors, and accountants have different work posts, different positions, and each has their most outstanding merits: some are versatile, resourceful, brave, and decisive; some are simple and hardworking, conscientious, and closely connected with the masses. However, these comrades all have common revolutionary qualities. They are all loyal revolutionaries, pragmatic promoters, and diligent and good cadres. Because they resolutely implement the Party's policies, maintain close ties with the masses, lead by example in everything, and take the lead in hard work, people praise them as communist pragmatists.

    Li Zhanzhong, the Party Branch Secretary of Xiaotao Management District in Jiacun People's Commune, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, is such a pragmatist. In his work, he always takes the lead, charges forward, overcomes difficulties, and sets an example for the masses with his exemplary actions. Wherever there is difficulty, he goes there. When there is a shortage of people for breeding work, Li Zhanzhong does it himself. When people reflect that feeding livestock is difficult, Li Zhanzhong moves his office to the feeding room and becomes a feeder. In order to increase the yield of wheat and cotton, he personally plants experimental plots. He thinks: "Since it is beneficial to the development of production and can increase social wealth, why shouldn't a Communist Party member do it?" Li Zhanzhong speaks first and acts first, so the masses follow closely: "Zhanzhong, you lead, and we'll all do it!" Li Zhanzhong has therefore won the love and trust of the masses, brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and at the same time, through his own hard work, he has also enriched his leadership experience and improved himself.

    Communist pragmatist, this is a noble and glorious title. We are doing revolution, and we must be honest and down-to-earth in doing the cause of revolution, and use our revolutionary actions to realize the communist ideal. Without the spirit of hard work, we cannot realize the revolutionary ideal, and we cannot do any work well. With lofty revolutionary ideals, hard work has a firm political direction and clear political goals; and with hard work in revolutionary action, ideals can become reality. Therefore, ideal is the driving force of hard work, and hard work is the practice of ideal.

    To be an idealistic pragmatist, this is what Chairman Mao taught, not to be an empty politician, nor to be an economist or technician who has lost his way. Such pragmatists are true Marxists and the most thorough promoters of the revolutionary cause. Under the direction of a lofty revolutionary ideal, wherever the Party points, they will work there, and wherever it is most difficult, they will go there to work. When they do things, they never shy away or shrink back, but always take the lead, charge forward, and move forward towards the revolutionary destination in a down-to-earth manner. They do not indulge in empty talk or seek false fame, but have a firm will and full of energy. They believe in the truth and use their practical actions to uphold the truth. To realize lofty ideals, they strive to become stronger, overcome obstacles, and no difficulties or obstacles can stop them from moving forward. Those model cadres who go deep into the front line of production and are determined to "eat, live, work, and consult with the people" are precisely this kind of pragmatist with communist style.

    For leading cadres to be pragmatists is precisely the practical action of "how can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?". When leading cadres go deep into reality and deep into the masses, they can discover problems and solve problems. By taking the lead in hard work and gaining experience, they can grasp the key points, drive the general, grasp one point, and guide the overall situation. In the process of specific hard work, leaders can not only learn skills and enrich experience, but also use their exemplary actions to break superstitions, mobilize the masses, and fully bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the people. People say it well: "One horse takes the lead, and ten thousand horses gallop." This is precisely the relationship between pragmatists and the masses.

    Everyone should be an idealistic pragmatist. Such pragmatists are not only good examples of resolutely implementing the Party's policies, but also good examples of resolutely following the mass line.

    有理想的实干家
    林旭
    人们常常用一些最亲切、最美好的词去形容那些模范的基层干部们：“知心书记”，“带头队长”，“放心主任”，“保险会计”……。这些书记、队长、主任、会计，工作岗位不同，职务不同，每个人也都具有自己最突出的优点：有人是能文能武、智勇双全、敢想敢干、多谋善断，有人是艰苦朴素、任劳任怨、工作深入、联系群众。但是，这些同志都有着共同的革命品质，他们都是忠心耿耿的革命者，是踏踏实实的促进派，是勤勤恳恳的好干部。由于他们坚决执行党的政策，密切联系群众，凡事以身作则，带头实干，因此，人们又称赞他们是共产主义的实干家。
    山西省万荣县贾村人民公社小桃管理区的党支部书记李占忠，就是这样一位实干家。他在工作中总是处处带头，冲锋陷阵，战胜困难，用自己的模范行动给群众做出榜样。哪里有困难，他就到哪里去，配种工作缺人，李占忠去做；人们反映喂牲口有困难，李占忠就把办公室搬到饲养室，当起了饲养员；为了提高小麦和棉花产量，就亲自种试验田。他这样想：“既然对发展生产有利，能增加社会财富，一个共产党员为什么不去干呢？”李占忠说在前头，做在前头，于是群众紧紧地跟上来了：
  “占忠，你领头，咱们大伙干！”李占忠因此获得了群众的爱戴和信任，发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，同时通过自己的实干，也丰富了领导经验，使自己受到了锻炼。
    共产主义的实干家，这是一个高尚的光荣称号。我们干革命，就是要老老实实，脚踏实地去干革命的事业，用自己的革命行为去实现共产主义的理想。没有实干的劲头，就不能实现革命理想，也就不能做好任何工作。有了远大的革命理想，实干就有了坚定的政治方向和明确的政治目的；而有了实干的革命行动，理想也才能够变成现实。因此，理想是实干的动力，实干是理想的实践。
    做有理想的实干家，这就是毛主席所教导的，既不要做空头的政治家，也不要做迷失方向的经济家和技术家。这样的实干家，是真正的马克思主义者，是革命事业的最彻底的促进派。在一个远大的革命理想支配下，党指到哪里，他们就干到哪里，哪里最困难，他们就到哪里去干。他们做起事情来，从不躲躲闪闪，畏畏缩缩，而是一马当先，猛打猛冲，踏踏实实地向着革命的目的地前进。他们不尚空谈，不务虚名，意志坚定，干劲十足。他们相信真理，用自己的实际行动去维护真理。实现远大的理想，他们奋发图强，披荆斩棘，任何困难，任何障碍都不能阻挡他们前进的步伐。那些深入到生产第一线去，决心和人民群众“同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量”的模范干部，正是这种具有共产主义风格的实干家。
    领导干部去当实干家，正是“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”的实践行动。领导干部深入实际、深入群众，就能发现问题、解决问题，通过自己带头实干，取得经验，就能够抓住重点，带动一般，抓住一点，指导全面。在具体的实干过程中，领导者不仅可以学到本领、丰富经验，同时也可以用自己的模范行动破除迷信，发动群众，充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性。人们说的好：一马当先，万马奔腾。这正是实干家和群众的关系。
    人人都应当做个有理想的实干家。这样的实干家，既是坚决执行党的政策的好榜样，也是坚决走群众路线的好榜样。
