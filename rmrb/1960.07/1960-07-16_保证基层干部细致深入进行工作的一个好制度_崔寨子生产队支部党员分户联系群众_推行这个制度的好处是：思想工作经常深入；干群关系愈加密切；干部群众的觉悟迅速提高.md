　　A Good System to Ensure Grassroots Cadres Conduct Thorough and In-Depth Work
　　Cuizaizi Production Brigade Branch Party Members Contact the Masses by Household
　　The Benefits of Implementing this System Are: Ideological Work is Regularly and Thorough; The Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses is Closer; The Consciousness of Cadres and the Masses is Rapidly Improved
    This newspaper reports that the Party Branch of the Cuizaizi Production Brigade of the Liuyingwu Commune in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, has established a system in which Party members contact the masses by household. The result of adhering to this system for several months is that the Party's mass line has been further promoted, political and ideological work has been greatly strengthened, and the production enthusiasm of the commune members has been fully mobilized, vigorously promoting the production movement centered on drought resistance.
    Since organizing the mass movement for a sustained leap forward in 1960, the Cuizaizi Party Branch has deeply felt that the various tasks have become more arduous, and that to lead the masses to complete these tasks well, it is necessary to further strengthen the fighting role of the Party's grassroots organizations and pay more attention to working methods. This spring, the county and commune cadres implemented the "two-five system" leadership method, which gave them great inspiration. They tried to create a method to ensure that grassroots cadres carry out their work more thoroughly and carefully. After repeated research and exploration, it was decided to implement a system in which Party members contact the masses by household. Twenty Party members and brigade cadres, led by the branch secretary, formed ten groups to contact the masses, based on their residential situation and ease of work. Their tasks are: (1) "Three explanations": explain tasks, policies, and methods to the masses at any time; (2) Understand the opinions and requirements of the commune members and report them to the branch in a timely manner; (3) Help commune members solve problems in production and life, care for commune members politically, and continuously improve their ideological awareness; (4) Conduct a summary and report once a day, and conduct a collective study every ten days, improve the policy level and working ability of Party members and cadres through summarizing work and learning.
    The Cuizaizi Party Branch experienced a process of ideological improvement in adhering to this system. In the beginning, some Party member cadres could not persist after contacting households; some persisted in the contact system, but the effect of publicizing policies, explaining tasks, and listening to the opinions of the masses was not significant, and they could not communicate with the masses heart-to-heart. The Party Branch studied this situation and believed that to effectively implement this system, the ideology of some Party members and cadres must first be revolutionized. After repeated research, the Party Branch started to solve these problems from three aspects. First, combined with practice, the significance of implementing the system of contacting the masses by household for changing general leadership and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses was further explained to all Party members and cadres; second, Cui Zetian, the Party Branch Secretary, and Cui Tongxing, the Deputy Secretary, took the lead in setting an example for Party members, and at any time introduced some methods, experiences, and gains of adhering to the contact system to everyone for experience exchange; third, constantly summarize and compare, affirm achievements, and commend Party members and cadres who performed well. In this way, all Party members and cadres had a deep understanding of the significance of contacting the masses by household, their ideology was improved, their methods were increased, and the contact with the masses system gradually became the conscious action of the Party branch members.
    Recently, in conjunction with summarizing the summer harvest experience, the Party Branch led Party members and cadres to summarize the implementation of this system. According to everyone's personal experience, it proves that this system has five major benefits:
    First, with the "three explanations," it is guaranteed that Party members and cadres regularly and deeply conduct ideological mobilization work. In performing various tasks, Party members and cadres explain the tasks, principles, and methods to the masses clearly, inspiring the masses to consciously complete them.
    Second, after implementing the system of contacting the masses by household, the style of consulting with the masses on everything is more common and frequent, so that the Party's leadership and the opinions of the masses are better integrated.
    Third, by regularly contacting the masses by household, all Party members and cadres have truly achieved comprehensive care for commune members in terms of production, life, and politics. In the past, some cadres were unwilling to do thorough and meticulous ideological work for middle and backward masses, and were not concerned enough about commune members politically. After contacting the masses by household, Party members and cadres all cared for commune members politically.
    Fourth, Party member cadres have become confidants of the masses, and the sense of ownership of the masses has been unprecedentedly strengthened. Party members, cadres, and the masses are all concerned about production. What work should be done and how to do it is not waiting for cadres to find commune members, but commune members take the initiative to find cadres.
    Fifth, Party members and cadres have strengthened their study, and their political and ideological level has been greatly improved. According to the spirit of the "two-five system," combined with the characteristics of production teams different from counties, communes, and management areas, they insisted on a system of summarizing work every five days and studying every ten days. In this way, the ideological level and leadership level of Party members and cadres have been continuously improved, the number of working methods has increased, and everything has a direction.

　　保证基层干部细致深入进行工作的一个好制度
　　崔寨子生产队支部党员分户联系群众
　　推行这个制度的好处是：思想工作经常深入；干群关系愈加密切；干部群众的觉悟迅速提高
    本报讯　河北省宁津县刘营伍公社崔寨子生产队党支部，建立了党员分户联系群众的制度。几个月来坚持这种制度的结果，使党的群众路线得到进一步发扬；政治思想工作大大加强；社员的生产积极性得到充分的调动，有力地推动了以抗旱为中心的生产运动。
    在组织1960年持续跃进的群众运动以来，崔寨子党支部深深感到各项任务更加繁重了，要领导群众很好地完成这些任务，就必须进一步加强党的基层组织的战斗作用，更加注意工作方法。今年春天，县、社干部实行“二五制”领导方法给了他们很大的启示。他们试图创造出一条保证基层干部更加深入细致地进行工作的方法。经过反复地研究、摸索，决定实行党员分户联系群众的制度。以支部书记为首的二十名党员和队干部，组成十个联系群众小组，根据居住情况和便于工作的原则包户联系群众。他们的任务是：（一）“三交”，随时向群众交代任务、交代政策、交代办法；（二）了解社员的意见和要求，及时向支部反映；（三）帮助社员解决生产、生活中的问题，从政治上关心社员，不断提高社员的思想觉悟；（四）每天进行一次总结、汇报，每十天进行一次集体学习，通过总结工作和学习，提高党员、干部的政策水平和工作能力。
    崔寨子党支部在坚持这一制度中，经历了一段提高思想的过程。开始，有些党员干部分户联系以后，不能坚持；有的虽然坚持联系制度，但在宣传政策、交代任务、听取群众意见等方面，收效不大，和群众不能心心相印。党支部研究了这种情况，认为要切实执行好这个制度，在某些党员、干部的思想上必须先革命。经过反复研究，党支部从三方面着手解决这些问题。首先，结合实践向全体党员、干部进一步讲解了执行分户联系群众的制度，对于改变一般化领导、密切党群关系的重要意义；第二，支部书记崔泽田、副书记崔同兴带头给党员作出样子，并随时把坚持联系制度的一些方法、体会和收获，向大家介绍，交流经验；第三，不断进行总结、评比，肯定成绩，表扬执行好的党员、干部，这样，全体党员、干部对分户联系群众的意义有了深刻的认识，思想提高了，方法也多了，联系群众制度逐渐成了这个支部党员的自觉行动。
    最近，结合总结夏收经验，党支部领导党员、干部对这个制度的执行情况进行了总结，根据大家切身体会，证明这个制度有五大好处：
    第一、有了“三交”就保证了党员和干部经常深入地做思想发动工作。在执行各项任务中，党员、干部把任务、道理和方法向群众讲得一清二楚，启发群众自觉地去完成。
    第二、实行分户联系群众的制度后，有事同群众商量的作风更加普遍和经常，使党的领导和群众的意见更好地结合起来。
    第三、通过经常分户联系群众，使全体党员、干部真正做到了从生产、生活和政治上全面关心社员。过去有些干部，对于中间的、落后的群众，不愿做深入细致的思想工作，从政治上关心社员不够，分户联系群众以后，党员、干部都从政治上关心社员。
    第四、党员干部成了群众的知心人，群众的主人翁感空前加强。党员、干部、群众一齐关心生产，什么活该做了，怎样做，不等干部找社员，社员就主动找干部。
    第五、党员、干部加强了学习，政治思想水平有很大提高，他们根据“二五制”的精神，结合生产队不同于县、社以及管理区的特点，坚持了五天一总结工作，十天一学习的制度，这样，党员干部的思想水平和领导水平不断提高，工作办法多了，事事有了方向。
