    Hunan and Zhejiang Vigorously and Meticulously Grasp Late-Stage Rice Cultivation, Striving for Large-Scale Balanced Production Increase
    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 1st dispatch) Hunan has launched a high tide of late-stage field management of early rice, focusing on strengthening the stalks, embryos, ears, and grains, as well as preventing drought, pests, wind, and lodging, striving for a large-scale balanced production increase.
    This year, the early rice planting area in Hunan Province has expanded significantly compared to last year. Although the early rice transplanting was a few days later than in previous years due to the cold wave during the spring plowing period, the majority of the province's early rice is showing good seedling vigor due to the fact that leaders at all levels went deep into the front line of production and vigorously grasped field management after transplanting. At present, the early rice in various places has entered the stages of swelling buds, heading, and flowering, respectively. According to surveys, the majority of the early rice that has already headed has a higher number of ears and grains than in previous years. This situation has greatly encouraged the broad masses of cadres and the masses. Now, various places have launched a high tide of late-stage management of early rice, centered on strengthening the stalks, embryos, ears, and grains, as well as preventing drought, pests, wind, and lodging. The Shaoyang Special District, after vigorously attacking the grain formation after booting, fixed more than 350,000 laborers to continue applying additional fertilizer to strengthen the buds, striving to achieve uniform and balanced heading and plump grains. You County in the Xiangtan Special District proposed specific targets for increasing the number of ears and grains of early rice. The labor force invested in late-stage field management in each commune increased from the original 50,000 to 70,000, of which more than 40,000 people formed professional teams to vigorously attack the booting, flowering, and lodging stages, striving for more ears, longer ears, larger grains, and plumper grains.
    Various places are also paying close attention to the work of preventing insects and lodging in early rice. The Chenzhou Special District established 400,000 mu of reconnaissance fields, command fields, experimental fields for promoting new technologies, and drug efficacy determination fields for preventing and controlling insect pests, and carried out large-scale joint prevention and control, basically controlling and eliminating early rice insect pests. In order to prevent lodging of early rice, the CPC Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee first implemented five measures in the 100-mu high-yield demonstration field of early rice that the prefecture committee established this year: First, apply phosphate and potash fertilizer as topdressing to strengthen the stalks and grains; second, under the premise of paying attention to drought prevention, drain the fields to dry them and increase the standing strength of the rice stalks; third, generally trample the fields once in the later stage to break the surface roots of the mud and make the roots deep-seated to enhance lodging resistance; fourth, continue to prevent and control diseases and insect pests; fifth, appropriately cut off part of the tip leaves to reduce the load on the rice stalks. Based on these successful experiences, guide the whole prefecture to actively prevent lodging and strive for a bumper harvest of early rice in every field.
    In vigorously grasping the late-stage management of early rice, various places have also carried out socialist labor competitions. The 28 field management professional teams of the Hucheng Brigade of the Hucheng Commune in Hanshou County launched a "protecting ears and attacking grains" competition, so that the entire brigade's 1,700 mu of early rice was universally sprayed with a soil pesticide, topdressed with phosphate and potash fertilizer to prevent lodging, and every field was filled with water, so that the entire team's work in preventing insects, lodging, drought, and bird and animal damage was done well. Luan Shan Commune in You County saw the emergence of an advanced Dongyuan Brigade in management, and the remaining nine brigades rose up to catch up. Through the competition, You County has now emerged with four advanced red flag communes, 56 brigades, 735 production teams, more than 3,000 operation groups, and more than 42,000 advanced cadres and commune members, thereby promoting the daily decline in the proportion of three types of seedlings of early and mid-season rice throughout the county, and the growth of first and second types of seedlings is becoming more and more vigorous, and the growth of rice seedlings has basically achieved balanced development.
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch) Various parts of Zhejiang Province have greatly broken the theory of early rice being set in stone, vigorously grasping late-stage cultivation and management work, striving for early rice with no yellow seedlings, no lodging, and no diseases, to achieve more ears, thicker stalks, and larger grains, and to achieve a comprehensive high yield.
    After two months of high-standard and high-efficiency cultivation and management, the early rice in Zhejiang Province has generally been weeded and fertilized more than three times, and the rice has grown strong. Some cadres and commune members, seeing this scene, believed that the early rice harvest was a foregone conclusion, and developed complacency and relaxation. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels mobilized the broad masses of cadres and commune members to meet in the fields, conduct inspections and evaluations, classify and rank the fields one by one, and carry out criticism and debate to overcome complacency and relaxation, and set off a new upsurge in cultivation and management. Recently, more than 3 million people in the province have invested in late-stage cultivation and management work. Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua, Jiaxing and other special districts are applying topdressing fertilizer, vigorously attacking the lodging stage, and rushing to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.
    The broad masses of commune members in Wenzhou Special District, where the season is earlier, have generally applied topdressing fertilizer and treated insects, and are now vigorously grasping the prevention of lodging and the reduction of empty grains, striving for a greater harvest. Huangyan County in this special district adopted the method of combining leaders, the masses, and technicians, organized more than 12,000 people to go deep into the fields to summarize the experience of preventing lodging, and launched a shock movement for the masses to vigorously attack the early rice lodging stage. All of the county's 70,000 mu of large rice fields have been drained, and most have been left to dry more than twice. Currently, the rice stalks are hard and the growth is stronger. The people's communes in the Hangjiahu and Ning (Bo) Shao (Xing) plains are also generally applying topdressing fertilizer during the current booting and heading period of early rice, and at the same time doing a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests.
    In strengthening the late-stage cultivation and management of early rice, various places in the province have also adopted the method of classifying and promoting, striving to add icing on the cake for first-class seedlings, accelerating the upgrading of second-class seedlings, and catching up for third-class seedlings.

    湖南浙江狠抓细抓早稻后期培育力争大面积平衡增产
    本报长沙1日电　湖南掀起攻秆、攻胎、攻穗、攻粒和防旱、防虫、防风、防倒的早稻后期田间管理高潮，力夺大面积平衡增产。
    今年，湖南省早稻种植面积，比去年扩大很多。虽然春耕期间受寒潮影响，早稻插秧比往年迟了几天，但由于插秧后各级领导深入生产第一线，大抓田间管理，全省大部分早稻都是一派好苗势。目前各地早稻已分别进入壮苞、吐穗、扬花阶段，据调查，已抽穗的早稻，大部分穗数和粒数超过了往年。这种情况，大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众。现在各地又掀起了以攻秆、攻胎、攻穗、攻粒和防旱、防虫、防风、防倒为中心的早稻后期管理高潮。邵阳专区在猛攻早稻孕穗后，固定了三十五万多劳动力，继续大追壮苞肥，力争做到抽穗整齐平衡，谷粒壮实。湘潭专区攸县提出了早稻增穗增粒的具体目标，各公社投入后期田间管理的劳力由原来五万人增加到七万人，其中有四万多人组成专业队，猛攻孕穗、扬花、倒伏关，力争穗多、穗长、粒大、粒壮。
    各地对早稻防虫、防倒伏的工作也抓得很紧。郴州专区建立了四十万亩防治虫害的侦察田、指挥田、推广新技术的试验田、药效测定田，展开大面积联防联治，基本上控制和消灭了早稻虫害。中共湘西土家族苗族自治州州委为了预防早稻倒伏，先在州委今年搞的百亩早稻高额丰产指挥田里实行了五项措施：一，施追磷钾肥，壮秆壮籽；二，在注意防旱的前提下放水晒田，增加禾秆的站劲；三，普遍在后期踩田一次，踩断泥面表根，使根深扎，增强抗倒力；四，继续防治病虫害；五，适当割去一部分尖叶，减轻禾秆负重。根据这些成功经验，指导全州积极防倒伏，争取早稻丘丘丰收。
    在狠抓早稻后期管理中，各地还开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。汉寿县护城公社护城大队的二十八个田间管理专业队，展开了“保穗攻粒”的竞赛，使全大队一千七百亩早稻普遍打了一次土农药，追了一道防倒磷钾肥，丘丘田灌满水，使全队防虫、防倒、防旱、防鸟兽害等项工作搞得好。攸县峦山公社在管理中出现了一个先进的东院大队，其余的九个大队便群起追赶。通过竞赛，目前攸县已涌现出先进红旗公社四个，大队五十六个，生产队七百三十五个，作业组三千多个，先进的干部和社员四万二千多个，从而促进了全县早、中稻三类苗的比重逐日下降，一、二类苗越长越旺，禾苗生长情况基本达到了平衡发展。
    本报杭州1日电　浙江省各地大破早稻定局论，狠抓后期培育管理工作，力争早稻无黄苗、无倒伏、无病害，达到穗多、秆粗、粒大，实现全面高产。
    浙江省的早稻经过两个月的高标准、高工效培育管理，普遍耘田、追肥三遍以上，稻谷生长健壮，再过半个多月就将全面收割。有些干部和社员看到这种景象，认为早稻收成已成定局，产生了自满松劲情绪。各级党委针对这一情况，发动广大干部和社员会师田间，进行检查评比，逐丘分类排队，开展鸣放辩论，克服了自满松劲情绪，掀起了培育管理新高潮。近来，全省有三百多万人投入后期培育管理工作，温州、宁波、金华、嘉兴等专区都在大施吊头肥，猛攻倒伏关和突击防治病虫害。
    季节较早的温州专区广大社员在普遍追肥、治虫后，已在大抓防止倒伏和减少秕谷，力争更大收成。这个专区的黄岩县采取领导、群众、技术员三结合的方法，组织一万二千多人深入田间，总结防止倒伏的经验，发动群众开展猛攻早稻倒伏关的突击运动，全县七万多亩大稻已全部排水，大多搁田两次以上，目前稻秆坚硬，生长更加健壮。杭嘉湖和宁（波）绍（兴）平原各人民公社也在当前早稻孕穗抽穗时期，普遍追施一次吊头肥，同时做好防治病虫害工作。
    全省各地在加强早稻后期培育管理中，还采取分类促进的办法，争取一类苗锦上添花，二类苗加速升级，三类苗迎头赶上。（附图片）
