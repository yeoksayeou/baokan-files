　　After the "Four Togethers"
　　Observations on the North Slope Commune of Hainan Island
　　By Our Reporter Huang Xiangqing

　　"Three More" and "Two Timely"
    During the busy season of summer planting, we came to the North Slope Commune in Wanning County, Hainan Island. The office of the commune party committee was in a room next to a high-yield area of more than 5,000 mu. Inside the room were several unadorned desks, and a few makeshift wooden beds were propped up against the wall. When cadres or commune members came in, they would sit on the beds if there were not enough stools. Chen Yongtao, the first secretary of the commune party committee, returned barefoot from the fields. As soon as he sat down, he began to talk non-stop: "I transplanted rice seedlings all morning and heard a lot of problems! The women have opinions about the work assignments in the previous period. They say that it would have been better if all the women had been put into weeding the middle rice a few days ago, and some people shouldn't have been temporarily drawn to accumulate fertilizer, so now we have to send people to weed, and we can't concentrate our efforts on transplanting late rice. And the people weeding also have opinions, because the weeds are longer than a few days ago, which makes it much more difficult to do. You see, how to arrange work reasonably according to the season and priorities is a big problem. The masses have opinions and also have good ideas, which are worth our attention!"
    Since the rectification and study at the county and commune cadre meetings, the more than 600 cadres in this commune, starting with the party committee secretary, have all implemented the "two-five system", going to the front lines of production and life, and sharing food, living, labor, and discussion with the commune members. The work of the whole commune immediately underwent great changes. The masses said it was "three more" and "two timely", that is: more people are doing concrete work on the front lines, more problems are discovered and solved, and more people are thinking of ways and ideas in a down-to-earth manner; at the same time, new problems are discovered in a timely manner, and problems are solved in a timely manner after they are discovered.

  Changing the Face of Backward Teams
    According to the commune party committee's decision on assigning areas of responsibility, Chen Mingfa, the party committee secretary, was assigned to the Sanlian Team, one of the most backward brigades. This team failed to complete its early rice planting plan this year, and there was a rare reduction in production since communization. What was the reason? The commune party committee has not yet figured it out.
    Chen Mingfa came to the brigade to participate in labor and quickly discovered that the late rice planting and seedling cultivation work had not yet been completed, and time was running out. At the same time, he found that some rice paddies were dry, but there were no plans to irrigate them. When he talked to the cadres and the masses about this problem, they said that there were not enough waterwheels. Hadn't enough waterwheels been purchased in the past? No, they were damaged. Everyone gathered together, and there were fifteen waterwheels scattered everywhere, and they weren't too badly damaged. It was further learned that more than 100 mu of early rice fields had not been drought-resistant due to lack of tools, which was one of the reasons for the reduction in production. Continuing to investigate from the waterwheel problem, it was found that the whole team was also short of 15 rakes and 22 plows as the summer planting entered a tense stage; in fact, they were also damaged and had not been repaired. Five carpenters were immediately organized to repair them, and the problem of the shortage of agricultural tools was quickly resolved.
    One morning, Chen Mingfa plowed the fields with commune member Wu Gongchang. After working for a long time, he found that there were only a few people plowing and transplanting rice in the fields. He asked: "Why are there only a few people working today?" Wu Gongchang said: "It's still early!" "Early? Then what about you? Haven't you plowed it several times?" Wu Gongchang didn't answer directly, but just said: "Early or late, it's all counted as one work point." After further investigation, it turned out that this brigade had never implemented quota management, and it was still at the management level of mutual aid groups. Many active laborers had opinions. In fact, none of these problems were too difficult to solve, but because they had not gone deep into the front lines in the past, they could not hear the opinions of the masses.
    This time, under the specific leadership and help of the party committee secretary, the work style of the cadres was rectified, and the existing problems were quickly and effectively resolved, and the whole team immediately changed its backward situation. The implementation of quota management greatly improved work efficiency. For example, plowing fields increased from one mu to 1.7 mu per person per day, completing the plowing work 20 days earlier than in previous years.

  Vigorously Grasping the Life of the Masses
    When First Secretary Chen Yongtao came to work in the North Slope Brigade, he saw that the canteen did not provide vegetables, and everyone brought their own meals back to eat. He asked, and it turned out that the four small canteens in this area had no family property, and the commune members relied on their private plots to grow vegetables. Chen Yongtao believed that to change the face of this brigade, it was necessary to start with running the canteen well.
    The first measure was for commune cadres to work in production teams, and the commune cadres also lived in the homes of commune members, vacating the buildings of the commune organs, so that the four small canteens could be merged into one large canteen, and the office cadres of North Slope Town also participated in it. In addition, vigorously grasp the production of family property, raise pigs, raise fish, plant five li of vegetable land per person, and immediately start sowing, with many cadres taking out their own money to buy vegetable seeds.
    The commune party committee secretary and cadres took turns to work as cooks in the kitchen, striving to improve the meals. When the masses saw the cadres eating with them and cooking themselves, they brought tables, stools, plates, and bowls from home, and automatically found bricks and stones to help the canteen build pigsties. In just a few days, a decent canteen was set up in this way.
    Due to going deep into the production teams to vigorously grasp life, all the canteens in the commune have been initially rectified, and those that have not been set up have been quickly set up. One or two months ago, only more than 3,000 people in the commune participated in the canteen; now, the number of participants has increased to more than 8,000, accounting for 97% of the total population.

  Leading Work is Easy and Effective
    First Secretary Chen Yongtao said that before and after the implementation of the "Four Togethers", the role of a cadre's words and suggestions was completely different. In the past, the masses sometimes just listened and didn't act, but now, they do it as soon as they say it, and they change it as soon as they say it. Therefore, the cadres deeply felt that the leading work was more effective. On the mass side, they also cared about work, so that production was done better.
    From the production achievements of this commune and the active actions of the commune members in production, we have seen that a new situation has indeed emerged.
    For example, in such a tense and short gap between summer harvest and summer planting, because the harvesting and plowing were done well, every late rice field was dried for 20 to 30 days; and in late June, the accumulation of fertilizer per mu had reached 64 dan, exceeding the level of the whole county at that time. The production enthusiasm of the commune members and the enthusiasm for caring about the work of the commune have also been greatly improved.

　　四同以后
　　海南岛北坡公社见闻
　　本报记者　黄向青
　　“三多”“两及时”
    夏种大忙期间，我们来到海南岛万宁县的北坡公社。公社党委办公的地方，是在一片五千多亩的高产片旁边的一间房子里。屋里放着几张未经特意摆设的办公桌，墙边有几张临时架起来的木床。干部或社员有事进来，凳子不够就往床上一坐。公社党委第一书记陈永韬打着赤脚从田间回来了。一坐下，他就滔滔不绝地谈起来：“插了一早的秧，倒听到不少问题呢！妇女们对前段排工有意见，说前几天妇女们全部投入中稻除草工作就好了，不应该临时又抽了些人去积肥，以至现在还得派人去除草，不能集中力量插晚稻。而除草的人也有意见，因为草比前几天长了，难做多了。你们看，如何按季节、分缓急、合理排工，确是大问题。群众有意见，也有很好的办法，十分值得我们注意呀！”
    这个社的六百多干部，自从经过县、社干部会议整风学习以后，从党委书记起，都贯彻执行了“二五制”，到生产、生活的第一线上去，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。全社工作立即发生了很大的变化。群众说是“三多”“两及时”，即：在最前线具体工作的人多了，发现问题解决问题多了，踏踏实实地想办法出主意的人多了；同时，发现新问题及时了，问题发现后也解决的及时了。
  改变落后队的面貌
    按照公社党委分片包干负责的决定，党委书记陈明发分配到最落后大队之一的三联队去。这个队今年早稻的播种计划没有完成，还出现了公社化以来少有的减产现象。原因在哪里？公社党委一直还未摸清。
    陈明发来到大队参加劳动，很快就发觉晚稻的播种育秧工作还未完成，而时间已很紧迫了。同时又发现有些秧田干巴巴的，可还不见有灌水的打算。同干部、群众谈起这个问题，说是水车不够。过去没有购置足够的水车吗？不是，是损坏了。大家一凑，就有十五部水车星散各处，而且并不是坏的太厉害。还进一步了解到，早稻有一百多亩田因缺工具根本没有抗旱，这是造成减产的原因之一。从水车问题继续查出全队在夏种进入紧张阶段，还缺耙十五张、缺犁二十二张；其实，也是损坏未修。立即组织了五个木工专门修理，缺农具的问题便迅速解决了。
    一天早上，陈明发同社员吴供昌下田犁地，干了好大一会，发现田间只有三三两两的人在犁田、插秧，便问道：“为什么今天只有几个人出工？”吴供昌说：“还早嘛！”“早？那么你呢？不是已经犁了好几遍了？”吴供昌没有正面回答，只是说：“早也一样，晚也一样，都是记一分工。”经过进一步了解，原来这个大队一直没有实行定额管理，还停留在互助组的管理水平呢。很多劳动积极的社员都有意见。其实，所有这些都不是太难解决的问题，只是因为过去没有深入第一线，听不到群众的意见罢了。
    这次，在党委书记的具体领导帮助下，整顿了干部作风，迅速地切实地解决了存在的问题，全队立即改变了落后局面。实行了定额管理，工效就大为提高了。如犁田每人每天从一亩提高到一亩七分，比往年提早了二十天完成犁田工作。
  大抓群众生活
    第一书记陈永韬到北坡大队工作，看到食堂不供菜，各人带饭回去吃。一问，原来这一片办的四个小食堂，都没有家底，社员靠自留地种菜吃。陈永韬认为，要改变这个大队的面貌，首先要从办好食堂入手。
    第一个措施是公社干部到生产队办公，公社的干部也分别住到社员家里，把公社机关的房屋腾出来，让四个小食堂合并成一个大食堂，北坡镇的机关干部也参加进去。另外，大抓家底生产，养猪、养鱼，每人种菜地五厘，而且立即动手播种，许多干部自己拿出钱来买菜种。
    公社党委书记和干部们都轮流到厨房当炊事员，努力搞好饭菜。群众看见干部们跟他们一起吃饭，还亲自下厨，都从家里拿来桌、凳、盘、碗，自动找来砖瓦石头，帮助食堂筑猪栏。没有几天，一个像样的食堂就这样办起来了。
    由于深入各生产队大抓生活，全社现有食堂都经过初步整顿，没有办的也迅速办了起来。一两个月前，全社参加食堂的只有三千多人；现在，参加人数增加到八千多人，占总人口97％。
  领导工作得心应手
    第一书记陈永韬说，实行“四同”前后，干部的一句话、一个建议，所起的作用就完全不同。以前，群众有时听了就算，现在，一说就做，一说就改。因此，干部们都深深感到，领导工作更加得心应手了。而群众方面，也关心工作，使生产做得更好了。
    我们从这个公社的生产成绩，社员们在生产中的积极行动，看到了新的局面确已出现了。
    比如：在夏收夏种这样紧张短促的间隙里，由于边收、边犁作得好，所以每一块晚稻田都争取晒了二十到三十天；还在6月下旬，每亩积肥已达六十四担，超过当时全县水平。社员的生产情绪和关心公社工作的积极性也大大提高了。
