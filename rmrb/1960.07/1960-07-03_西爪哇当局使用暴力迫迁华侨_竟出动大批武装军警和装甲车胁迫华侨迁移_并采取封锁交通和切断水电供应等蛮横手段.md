Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd – News: The military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, on June 29th and 30th, deployed armed forces, police, and even armored vehicles, resorting to violent means such as firing warning shots, cutting off water and electricity, and blocking traffic to forcibly relocate Overseas Chinese. The second large-scale campaign to force the relocation of Overseas Chinese, instigated by powerful groups in West Java, Indonesia, has entered a very critical stage.

On the morning of June 29th, an officer, a police officer, and five armed soldiers and police officers, traveling in two trucks and a jeep, entered Maja Laya and forcibly ordered the local Overseas Chinese to immediately move to Bandung. The local Overseas Chinese expressed their difficulties and explained why it was difficult to move. A soldier threatened them, saying, "If you don't move out, we will send you to court, where your problems will be resolved!" Around 1 p.m. that day, the military sent nine fully armed soldiers and one armored vehicle to coerce the Overseas Chinese, demanding that they "must all move out by the 30th."

On the morning of June 30th, the West Java military authorities indeed dispatched a large contingent of troops, including approximately twenty-five armed soldiers, ten armed police officers, and ten village militiamen, to execute the forced relocation order. They blocked traffic between Maja Laya and Bandung from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

These soldiers and police officers went door-to-door to knock on the doors of Overseas Chinese residences and shops, ordering them to immediately move their belongings onto trucks for relocation. Soldiers forcibly dismantled a bed in an Overseas Chinese home. Another soldier fired a shot into the air in front of the door of an Overseas Chinese man named Xi Liang as a threat. Some soldiers rushed into the home of an Overseas Chinese man and forcibly loaded some of the furniture onto their trucks. The Overseas Chinese there went to great lengths to prevent the items from being taken away. As the troops and police officers left, they threatened that they would still carry out the forced relocation order and that the Overseas Chinese there must move out the next day.

On June 29th and 30th, the military also sent armed military police to Cimahi to implement forced relocation. On June 30th, dozens of soldiers and police officers, along with some personnel specifically tasked with cutting off water and electricity, arrived in Cimahi in two trucks. They cut off the power lines of many Overseas Chinese households and blocked the water pipes of more than ten Overseas Chinese households, forcing the Overseas Chinese to move out. Three armed police officers rushed into the shop of Overseas Chinese Lin Minzhu. A soldier guarded the door, and then the police officers closed the shop's doors and began cutting off the electricity and water. A police officer named Li Li, holding a pistol, fiercely said to Lin's wife, "I am here under orders; killing ten people is nothing!" As he left, he threatened, "I will bring a machine gun here in a little while." This unreasonable intimidation of women caused great anxiety and indignation among the local Overseas Chinese.

On June 29th, fifteen soldiers and police officers arrived in Cimahi in three trucks, with the soldiers carrying wooden sticks and the police officers carrying pistols, forcing the Overseas Chinese to relocate.

While carrying out the forced relocations, the Bandung military authorities also intensified their efforts to forcibly requisition the meeting places of Overseas Chinese organizations in Bandung. On June 30th, a military officer from the Bandung "Accommodation" Committee convened a meeting with the leaders of ten Overseas Chinese organizations in Bandung, unreasonably forcing them to vacate their meeting places as soon as possible, even though these places served the public welfare and educational endeavors of the Overseas Chinese. The key to the Bandung Yongding Association's meeting place has already been forcibly taken away by the military.

The Overseas Chinese residing in the areas affected by the second large-scale forced relocation have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities in West Java, expressing their difficulties and requesting compliance with the promise made by the Indonesian Foreign Minister three months ago to halt the forced relocations. They also requested the authorities to consider the increasing difficulties they are facing under various anti-Chinese measures and to provide them with relief.

The aforementioned activities of the West Java military authorities in forcing the relocation of Overseas Chinese occurred on and after June 29th, the same day that Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio met with Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia.

    西爪哇当局使用暴力迫迁华侨
    竟出动大批武装军警和装甲车胁迫华侨迁移
    并采取封锁交通和切断水电供应等蛮横手段
    新华社2日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局在6月29日、30日出动武装部队、警察以至装甲车，采取鸣枪威胁、剪断水电供应、封锁交通等暴力手段强迫华侨搬迁。印度尼西亚有势力集团在西爪哇掀起的第二次大规模迫迁华侨的活动已进入十分紧急的阶段。
    6月29日上午，一名军官、一名警官和五名武装士兵和警察分乘两辆卡车和一辆吉普车开入马者拉夜，强迫命令当地华侨立即迁到万隆去。当地华侨向他们申诉困难，说明了难以搬迁。一个士兵就向他们威胁说：“如果你们不搬出去，就把你们送到法庭去，在那里来解决你们的问题！”当天下午一点钟左右，军方派九名全副武装的士兵并出动装甲车一辆，到那里去胁迫华侨，要他们“必须在30日全部搬出去。”
    6月30日清晨，西爪哇军事当局果然派出了包括约有二十五名武装军人、十名武装警察和十名乡村自卫队员的大批军队到那里去执行迫迁的命令，他们从上午十一点到下午三点封锁了马者拉夜和万隆之间的交通。
    这些军人和警察挨户去敲华侨住宅和商店的门，命令他们立即把东西搬到卡车上，以便迁移出去。军人到一个华侨家里强行拆掉了卧床。另一名军人在一个名叫锡良的华侨的门口朝天放枪进行威胁。一些军人冲进了一个华侨的家中，把部分的家具强行装进他们的卡车上。那里的华侨费了很多周折才阻止把东西运走。当这些军队和警察离开那里的时候，他们扬言说，他们将仍然要执行迫迁的命令，那里的华侨必须在第二天搬走。
    6月29日和30日军方也派了武装军警到芝马墟实行迫迁。在6月30日那天，几十名军人和警察带了一些专门切断水电供应的人员乘两辆卡车驶抵芝马墟，他们切断了许多家华侨住户的电线，并且堵塞了十多家华侨住户的水管，强迫华侨迁出去。有三名武装警察冲进华侨林民珠的商店，一名军人把守住门口，接着这些警察关闭了这家商店的大门，并且开始切断电线和水源。一个名叫利利的警察拿着手枪对林的妻子凶猛地说，“我是奉命前来的，打死十个人也不算一回事！”当他离开的时候他又威胁说，“稍过一会我将把机关枪带到这里来。”对妇女进行的这种蛮不讲理的恐吓引起了当地华侨极大的忧虑和愤慨。
    6月29日，十五名军人和警察乘三辆卡车驶抵芝马墟，军人拿着木棍，警察拿着手枪，强迫华侨迁移。
    在进行迫迁的同时，万隆军事当局也加紧强迫征用万隆华侨团体的会所。万隆“收容”委员会的一个军人6月30日召集万隆十个华侨团体的领导人开会，无理强迫他们必须尽快腾空会所，而他们的会所是用来为华侨的公益和教育事业服务的。万隆永定公会会所的钥匙已经被军人强行拿走。
    居住在第二次大规模迫迁地区的华侨一再向西爪哇有关当局申诉他们的困难，并且要求遵守印度尼西亚外交部长在三个月以前所作过的诺言，停止迫迁。他们还要求当局考虑他们目前在各项排华措施下所受到的日益增长的困难而给他们提供救济。
    西爪哇军事当局上述这些逼迁华侨的活动是在印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约6月29日在会见中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇的当天和以后发生的。
