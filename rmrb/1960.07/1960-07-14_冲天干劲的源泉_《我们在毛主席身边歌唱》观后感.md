　　The Source of Soaring Enthusiasm
　　——Reflections on "We Sing Beside Chairman Mao"
　　Dong Shanyuan
    Not long ago, at the opening ceremony of the National Workers' Literary and Art Performance, I saw the wonderful performance by the Beijing delegation. In particular, the heroic chorus "We Sing Beside Chairman Mao," performed by four hundred representatives of heroic collectives, concentratedly expressed the Beijing workers' and the people of the whole country's sincere love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and expressed the unparalleled happiness and pride of working and living beside Chairman Mao, deeply moving the tens of thousands of spectators present.
    After the performance, as I walked in front of Tiananmen Square, I suddenly remembered the words from Comrade Huang Xiaosheng's "Diary of Attending the National Day Ceremony in Beijing" that I had read last year:
  “Instantly, I felt that I could cross the sea to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, I could shake my arms and push away ten thousand mountains, I could pull a barge to chase the wind, I could carry ten thousand catties of goods on my shoulders.” Isn't this exactly my feeling at this moment? Seeing Chairman Mao on the viewing platform, he couldn't help but write with infinite excitement: "I am on the east viewing platform, my loyal heart is next to you, you point out the future and I grow wings, and fly to the destination in the blink of an eye." Isn't this exactly the feeling expressed in this heroic chorus? Yes, I realized that the reason why this song is so inspiring is precisely because it expresses the common feelings in everyone's heart. I thought, how wonderful it would be if it were made into a movie and shown to the people of the whole country!
    Now, I have indeed seen a large-scale documentary "We Sing Beside Chairman Mao" with richer content and more vivid images in the cinema. Most of the shots in this film were taken on-site in factories, rural areas, construction sites, schools, etc. It records the moving scenes of the capital's construction, the leaps and bounds of the production front, the rapidly changing technological revolution, and the rich and colorful cultural life. And all of this is filled with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, which powerfully shows that it is this feeling that has generated endless enthusiasm. Once this feeling becomes an artistic image, it will inevitably resonate most strongly with the people of the whole country's heartfelt love for the Party and Chairman Mao – how happy and proud we are to be born in the era of Mao Zedong! Thus, soaring enthusiasm flows through the whole body, and no matter in any production or battle, no matter in the face of any difficulties, we will be invincible and unstoppable.
    All the "actors" in this film are workers, peasants, students, and office cadres, and more than 30,000 people participated in the filming. This is a sign that the high tide of the cultural revolution has arrived. There is a ditty from a scaffold shanty; a group of quick-clapper talkers at the mine entrance; a dance by workshop workers showing communist style; a chorus of housewives praising the urban people's commune; in Yongfengtun, the village of music, old men sing at the top of their lungs; in Wanglizhuang, the village of poetry, young pioneers take the stage to compete in poetry... The common theme of these programs is to praise the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. It is precisely under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao that the working people, holding high the three red flags, have won the rapid development of productive forces and have also begun to become the masters of culture. Everyone is filled with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and brilliant scenes of a sea of poetry, a sea of paintings, a village of music, and a hometown of song have appeared everywhere. As the poet Wang Lao Jiu said: "Chairman Mao shook my hand, my heart is more rust-proof than gold, a colorful phoenix flies out of my heart, and a heartfelt song comes out of my mouth." This film vividly shows the source of the soaring enthusiasm of the people in the cultural revolution.
    We live in the era of Mao Zedong, we sing beside Chairman Mao, we have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we are indestructible, and no height is insurmountable. Our production front and cultural front are leaping forward towards higher peaks. This film successfully expresses our common feelings, so it has also become an excellent poem to encourage great efforts.

　　冲天干劲的源泉
　　——《我们在毛主席身边歌唱》观后感
　　董善元
    不久前，在全国职工文艺会演的开幕式上，看到了北京代表团的精彩表演。特别是四百名群英会代表演出的英雄大合唱《我们在毛主席身边歌唱》，集中地表达了北京工人和全国人民热爱党、热爱毛主席的真挚感情，表达了在毛主席身边劳动、生活的无比幸福和无比自豪，深深地激动着在座的上万观众。
    演出结束后，我走在天安门前，忽然想起了去年读过的黄孝声同志的《进京观礼日记》里边的话：
  “顿时，我感到我能跨海活捉蒋介石，我能振臂推开万座山，我能牵着驳轮追疾风，我能双肩扛起万斤货。”这不正是我此时的感情吗？他在观礼台上看到毛主席，禁不住无限激动地写出：“我在东边观礼台，一颗忠心挨着您，您指前程我插翅，眨眼飞到目的地”。这不正是这支英雄大合唱里所表达的感情吗？对的，我意识到这支歌所以这样激动人心，正是因为它表达了每个人心中的共同感情。我想，如果把它拍成电影，让全国人民看到，该有多好！
    现在，我果然从影院看到了内容更丰富、形象更鲜明的大型纪录片《我们在毛主席身边歌唱》。这部影片的绝大部分镜头拍自工厂、农村、工地、学校等现场。它记录着首都建设的动人图景，记录着生产战线的飞跃步伐，记录着日新月异的技术革命，记录着丰富多彩的文化生活。而所有这一切处处洋溢着对党、对毛主席的无限爱戴的感情，它有力地表明正是这种感情产生了无穷无尽的干劲。这种感情一旦成为艺术形象，它就必然和全国人民对党对毛主席的衷心热爱发生最大的共鸣——我们生在毛泽东时代是多么幸福和骄傲！于是，冲天干劲在全身奔流，不论在各项生产和战斗当中，不论在任何困难面前，都将所向无敌、锐不可当。
    这部影片的所有“演员”都是工人、农民、学生和机关干部，参加拍摄的群众超过了三万人次。这是文化革命高潮业已到来的一个标志。这里有脚手架房的排子曲；有矿坑口上的快板群；有车间工人表现共产主义风格的舞蹈；有家庭妇女歌颂城市人民公社的合唱；在音乐之乡永丰屯，老大爷引吭高歌；在诗村王立庄红领巾登台赛诗……。这些节目的共同主题都是歌颂总路线、大跃进和人民公社。劳动人民正是在毛主席的英明领导下，高举三面红旗，赢得了生产力的飞速发展，也开始成为文化的主人。人人充满了对党对毛主席的无限热爱，处处出现了诗洋、画海、乐村、歌乡的灿烂景象。正如诗人王老九所说的：“毛主席和我握了手，我心比黄金永不锈，心窝里飞出五彩凤，贴心的歌儿唱出口。”这部影片形象地表明了人民群众在文化革命中的冲天干劲的源泉。
    我们生活在毛泽东时代，我们在毛主席的身边歌唱，我们有毛主席的英明领导，无坚不可摧，无高不可攀。我们的生产战线和文化战线向着更高的尖端阔步跃进。这部影片成功地表达了我们的共同感情，所以它也同样成为大鼓干劲的优秀诗篇。
