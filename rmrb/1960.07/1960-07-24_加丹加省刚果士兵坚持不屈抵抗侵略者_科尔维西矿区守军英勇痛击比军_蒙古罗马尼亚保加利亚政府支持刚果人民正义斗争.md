Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, Elisabethville Dispatch: In the Katanga Province of Congo, occupied by a large number of Belgian troops, Congolese soldiers there continue to resist the Belgian invading army unyieldingly.

According to reports, on the morning of the 22nd, in the Kolwezi mining area, northwest of Elisabethville, the capital of the province, approximately 260 Belgian invading soldiers, coordinated with rockets fired from aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the Congolese garrison at the N'zilo hydroelectric power plant there, attempting to force the Congolese soldiers there to surrender and thus occupy the factory. However, this was met with a heroic counterattack by the 250 Congolese soldiers defending the factory. The Congolese soldiers shelled the attacking enemy troops and used automatic weapons to shoot at the Belgian aircraft, killing and wounding a number of Belgian invading soldiers. A Belgian colonial army officer said, "They (the Congolese army) fought fiercely and accurately."

Reports say that the Belgian colonial army is reinforcing the area.

Another report from Usumbura, the capital of Ruanda-Urundi, states that in the Lakondu-Kindu area of eastern Congo, approximately 1,500 Congolese soldiers are also engaged in a struggle against the armed aggression of the Belgian colonialists. According to reports, at the same time, the Belgian authorities are planning to launch a large-scale military operation against the Congolese garrison in Lakondu.

The statement emphasized that the chains of colonialism are collapsing entirely. The heroic Congolese people are not isolated in their heroic struggle to win the independence of their country and oppose imperialist aggression. Their just struggle has aroused the sincere sympathy and warm support of peace-loving people all over the world, including the Mongolian people.

The statement said that the Mongolian people firmly believe that the Congolese people will fight to the end heroically and defend the independence of their young republic.
