Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. The people's communes and military farms in various cotton-producing areas of Xinjiang have recently dispatched over 10,000 specialized cotton field management teams (groups) to strengthen the management of over 2 million mu of cotton fields across the region. Currently, the main focus is on intensive cultivation, weeding, topdressing, watering, and pest and disease control.

This year, Xinjiang's cotton field area has expanded by 13% compared to last year, and the sowing quality is better than in previous years. However, since sowing, major cotton-producing areas such as Kashgar, Hotan, Turpan, Aksu, and the Manas River basin have been hit by several cold waves, rainstorms, and strong winds. The temperature has fluctuated sharply. In early May, the lowest ground temperature in the Manas River basin even dropped to minus two degrees Celsius, resulting in frost damage. The Party committees of various cotton-producing areas immediately took the lead, with secretaries in charge, mobilizing the masses to launch a campaign to check, replant, and resow seedlings, enabling most of the cotton fields to achieve full stands. To change the adverse effects of natural disasters, such as low ground temperatures, soil compaction, and rising soil salinity, which were detrimental to cotton seedling development, the Party committees of various cotton-producing areas further tightened the leadership and organization of cotton field management, universally established specialized cotton field management teams (groups), and adopted the method of leading cadres taking the lead in dividing areas of responsibility, going deep into the fields to strengthen management. For example, Makit County, which won the title of "Hundred Jin Ginned Cotton County" last year, established cotton leadership groups or command posts at every level from the county to the commune management area, with the county Party secretary in charge, organizing five levels of cadres across the county to converge in the fields, researching a complete set of methods to promote more cotton budding, early boll formation, and large boll formation, and drawing 40% of the labor force to strengthen cotton field management.

Thanks to strengthened leadership and concentrated labor, cotton field management has become increasingly meticulous in various localities. Most of the previously weak cotton plants have generally become strong with lush foliage and have begun to bud. All the cotton fields in the Hotan area have been cultivated two to three times, combined with watering, soil has been added around the base of the plants and one to two applications of quick-acting fertilizer have been applied, and the cutworms and cotton aphids have been completely eliminated, so that the cotton fields in the entire area have basically achieved no compaction, no weeds, no drought or flood, no pests and diseases, and no weak seedlings. The military farms in the Manas River basin, in response to the particularly low ground temperature, have continuously carried out cultivation and soil loosening to promote ground temperature increases, enabling cotton seedlings to quickly transform from weak to strong. Kashgar Prefecture, which has the largest cotton planting area in Xinjiang, has also universally promoted the use of wooden cultivators, human-drawn wooden-tooth harrows, and other tools, which have increased the efficiency of cultivation by three to four times.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Cotton-producing areas in Sichuan are carrying out a cotton field management campaign, striving for early boll formation, more boll formation, and large boll formation. Currently, more than half of the cotton fields have been weeded and topdressed once. Areas where pests and diseases have occurred have generally been treated once; early cotton has already budded or flowered, and the "Cotton King" groups carefully cultivated in various places have begun to form bolls.

In the past, Sichuan Province's cotton production generally only focused on mid-season and late-season bolls. This year, to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, according to the cotton growth cycle and making full use of the favorable conditions of a mild climate, various localities are focusing on an additional season of early-season bolls. Experience has proven that as long as sowing and management are done early, it is entirely possible to focus on an additional season of early-season bolls; and grasping early-season bolls is also very helpful in preventing cotton plants from growing too tall, promoting more mid-season boll formation, and reducing bud and boll shedding.

To seize the "Three Bolls" (early-season bolls, mid-season bolls, and late-season bolls), it is first necessary to strive for the "Three Seedlings" (full stands, uniform stands, and strong seedlings). Various cotton-producing areas this year have first grasped the work of thinning seedlings, replanting seedlings, and determining seedling density. Shehong County, after completing the sowing task of 160,000 mu of cotton with guaranteed quality and quantity, immediately seized the opportunity after rain to extensively replant missing seedlings and missing spots. Through comparison and inspection, Taiyi Commune has eliminated third-class seedlings in all 1,600 mu of early cotton, with first-class seedlings accounting for more than 80%. Currently, various localities are heavily applying bud fertilizer to provide sufficient nutrients for early-season and mid-season bolls. Jianyang County, one of the main cotton-producing areas, has applied light fertilizer and full irrigation three times in succession to its more than 500,000 mu of cotton, according to different stages such as promoting seedling growth, budding, and initial flowering, on the basis of basically achieving full stands, uniform stands, and strong seedlings.

Adhering to regular pest and disease control to protect seedlings and buds is an important aspect of the cotton field management campaign. To achieve "bringing bolls into midsummer, midsummer bolls filling the waist, and late-season bolls covering the top," the province is currently promoting the experience of Jianyang County in setting up a pest control team for every 40 to 50 mu of cotton fields, forming a pest control network for regular prevention and treatment. Renshou County has adhered to a system of pest control once every seven days, and currently pest control work has been generally carried out on 500,000 mu of cotton in the county, with good results.

Various cotton-producing areas have universally established specialized cotton field management teams, implementing a system of specialized fertilizer for specialized use, specialized personnel for accumulation, specialized pesticide for specialized use, and specialized personnel for prevention and treatment, making topdressing, pest control, and other work more meticulous and solid.

This newspaper, Hefei, 3rd. This year, Anhui Province's cotton fields, due to attention to sowing quality and sufficient base fertilizer application, are growing well, generally nearly a foot tall, with lush branches and leaves, and have universally entered the budding stage. Currently, the broad masses of commune members in the cotton-growing areas are closely focusing on the central link of forming more pre-midsummer bolls, taking various management measures, and launching a cotton production increase campaign. Dangshan County, one of Anhui's key cotton-growing areas, has more than 50,000 laborers, forming 1,473 specialized cotton field management teams, closely grasping management activities such as topdressing, cultivation and soil addition, pest elimination, and artificial pollination. Cadres at all levels go deep into the front line of production, leading the masses to make field management work meticulous and concrete. Xiao County, which accounts for nearly one-tenth of the province's cotton planting area, currently has 80,000 skilled cotton growers invested in cotton field management. They have taken measures such as early seedling thinning, early seedling determination, early cultivation, early topdressing, and early pest control, advancing the time of growth of the first fruiting branch by three to five days, creating favorable conditions for early boll formation and more boll formation. In order to achieve balanced development of cotton fields, Huangkou Commune in this county has launched a "Five Catch-Up" campaign: summer cotton catching up with spring cotton, replanting catching up with early sowing, transplanting catching up with original seedlings, distant fields catching up with nearby fields, and lean fields catching up with fertile fields. The entire commune's lean fields, third-class seedlings, and backward fields have generally been processed one or two more times, with an additional ten jin of ammonium sulfate fertilizer applied per mu, striving to bring bolls into midsummer. Under the meticulous management of specialized teams, most of the third-class seedlings in Anqing Prefecture's more than 600,000 mu of cotton fields have caught up with first and second-class seedlings. The large-scale high-yield cotton field, which extends for three hundred li in this prefecture, has established a high-yield zone command post in Huayang Commune, Wangjiang County, and also established an experimental field, promptly observing seedling conditions and preventing and controlling various diseases, so that cotton plants are robust and buds and bolls are increasing.

    新疆四川安徽棉田管理越作越细致
    及时除治虫害，重施孕穗肥，力争大面积平衡增产
    新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆各产棉区的人民公社和军垦农场，最近出动了一万多个棉田管理专业队（组），加强对全区二百多万亩棉田的管理，目前主要是突击中耕、除草、追肥、浇水和防治病虫害。
    今年新疆棉田面积比去年扩大13％，播种质量胜过往年。但是自下种以来，喀什、和田、吐鲁番、阿克苏和玛纳斯河流域等主要产棉区，曾连续遭到数次寒潮、暴雨和大风的袭击，气温忽冷忽热，玛纳斯河流域一带5月上旬地面最低温度竟下降到零下二度，出现了冻害。各产棉区党委立即由书记挂帅，动员群众展开了一次查苗、补苗、补种运动，使绝大部分棉田达到全苗。为了改变自然灾害带来的地温低、地皮板结、地下盐碱上升等不利棉苗发育的影响，各产棉区党委又进一步抓紧棉田管理的领导和组织工作，普遍成立棉田管理专业队（组），采取干部带头分片包干的办法，深入田间，加强管理。如去年获得百斤皮棉县的麦盖提县，就是从县到公社管理区，层层建立棉花领导小组或指挥部，由县委书记挂帅，组织全县五级干部会师田间，研究出一整套促使棉花多现蕾、早结桃、结大桃的办法，抽调40％的劳力加强了棉田管理。
    各地由于加强了领导，集中了劳力，棉田越管越细，大部分前期生长瘦弱的棉花，普遍株壮叶茂，开始现蕾。和田专区各地棉田已全部中耕两次到三次，结合浇水培土追施了一次到两次速效肥，全部扑灭了地老虎和棉蚜，使全专区棉田基本上达到无板结、无杂草、无旱涝、无虫害和无弱苗。玛纳斯河流域各军垦农场，针对地温特低的情况，不断地进行中耕松土，促使地温上升，使棉苗迅速由弱转壮。全疆植棉最多的喀什专区，还普遍推广木质中耕器、人拉木齿耙等工具，使中耕工效提高了三、四倍。
    新华社成都讯　四川各产棉区开展棉田管理运动，力争棉花早结桃，多结桃，结大桃。现在，半数以上的棉田已除草、追肥一次。发生病虫害的，已普遍防治了一次；早棉已经现蕾或开花，各地精心培育的“棉花王”群已开始结桃。
    四川省的棉花生产过去一般只抓伏桃和秋桃。今年为了争取棉花丰收，根据棉花生长规律，充分利用气候温和的有利条件，各地都在多抓一季夏桃。经验证明，只要早种早管，多抓一季夏桃是完全有把握的；而抓住夏桃，对于防止棉株陡长、多结伏桃、减少蕾铃脱落也有很大作用。
    要夺“三桃”（夏桃、伏桃、秋桃），首先必须争“三苗”（苗全、苗齐、苗壮）。各产棉区今年都首先抓紧了匀苗、补苗、定苗工作。射洪县在保质保量地完成十六万亩棉花播种任务以后，立即抓住雨后时机大补缺苗、缺窝。太乙公社通过评比检查，全社一千六百多亩早棉花已经消灭了三类苗，一类苗占80％以上。目前各地正在重施孕蕾肥，为夏桃和伏桃提供充分养料。主要产棉区之一的简阳县，五十多万亩棉花在基本实现苗全苗齐苗壮的基础上，已分别按照提苗、孕蕾、初花等不同阶段，先后进行了三次淡肥饱灌。
    坚持定期的防治虫害工作，保苗护蕾，是棉田管理运动的一个重要方面。为了实现“带桃入伏、伏桃满腰、秋桃盖顶”，全省目前正在推广简阳县创造的每四十至五十亩棉田设一治虫小组的经验，构成一个虫害防治网，定期防治。仁寿县坚持了每七天防治虫害一次的制度，目前全县五十万亩棉花已普遍进行了防治工作，收效很好。
    各产棉区普遍建立了棉田管理专业队，实行专肥专用、专人积造、专药专用、专人防治的制度，使追肥、治虫等工作做得更加细致扎实。
    本报合肥3日电　今年，安徽省的棉田，由于注意了播种质量，底肥施得足，生长情况良好，一般苗高近尺，枝叶茂盛，普遍进入蕾期。目前，棉区广大社员正紧紧围绕多结伏前桃这一中心环节，采取多种管理措施，掀起一个棉花增产运动。安徽重点棉区之一的砀山县，有五万多劳力，组成一千四百七十三个棉田管理专业队，紧抓追肥、中耕培土、灭虫、人工授粉等管理活动。各级干部深入生产第一线，领导群众把田间管理工作，做得细致具体。占全省植棉面积近十分之一的萧县，目前投入棉田管理的植棉能手达八万人，他们采取早间苗、早定苗、早中耕、早追肥、早防虫的措施，使生长第一根果枝的时间，提早了三至五天，为早结桃，多结桃创造了有利条件。这个县的黄口公社为了使棉田平衡发展，掀起了夏棉赶春棉、补种赶先种、移苗赶原苗、远田赶近田、瘦田赶肥田的五赶运动，将全社所有瘦田、三类苗、落后田普遍多加工一、二次，每亩多施硫酸铵肥料十斤，争取带桃入伏。安庆专区六十多万亩棉田，在专业队精致管理下，三类苗大部赶上了一、二类苗。这个专区培养的长达三百里的大面积棉花丰产田，在望江县华阳公社设立了一个高产片指挥部，同时附设了一个试验场，及时观测苗情和防治多种病害，使棉棵茁壮，蕾铃增多。
