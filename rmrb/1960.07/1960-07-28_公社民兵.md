Commune Militia
    Liu Zhang
    The cold wind and rain soak the cloth clothes,
    Climbing mountains and wading through water to practice,
    Bayonets pierce through the sky's fog,
    Winning the red flag on the shooting range!

    Female shepherd with a rifle on her shoulder and whip in hand,
    Chasing a cloud of white sheep draped in sunset glow,
    Model female shepherd of the commune,
    A flower in the militia company.

    公社民兵
    刘章
    风雨冷风凉雨浸布衣，爬山涉水来演习，刺刀挑去满天雾，打靶场上夺红旗！
    女牧工肩背猎枪手扬鞭，赶团白云披身霞，公社牧羊女模范，民兵连里一支花。
