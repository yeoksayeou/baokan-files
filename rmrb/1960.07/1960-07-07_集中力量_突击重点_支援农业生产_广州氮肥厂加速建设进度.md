According to Southern Daily News, the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is resolutely implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, actively adopting measures to accelerate the speed of capital construction, and striving for early production of chemical fertilizers. Currently, the plant's large-scale synthetic ammonia workshop and phosphate fertilizer workshop are under intensified construction.

The Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is one of the chemical industrial bases in South China, mainly producing chemical fertilizers, and is being built in phases. Construction began in the second half of 1958, and now one of the main workshops—the large-scale synthetic ammonia workshop—is intensifying the construction of its main factory buildings. The sulfuric acid workshop with an annual output of 80,000 tons was completed and put into production last year. To support agricultural production, two fertilizer workshops were determined to be added in the fourth quarter of last year. Among them, the superphosphate workshop's main factory buildings are under intense construction and will soon be completed and put into production; the small synthetic ammonia workshop with an annual output of 800 tons is currently preparing for trial production.

In order to produce chemical fertilizers as soon as possible, the plant has adopted active measures to speed up the construction progress. The plant established a special crash construction team, arranged the project progress according to priorities and urgency, and ensured that the capital construction progress was completed in a planned and focused manner. They adhered to the practice of simultaneously carrying out capital construction, installation, production, and reform, which not only accelerated the construction speed but also cultivated talents. For example, when the high-pressure part of the small synthetic ammonia workshop was undergoing civil engineering, the low-pressure part had already begun installation. Twenty-one of the twenty-five operating equipment in this workshop were repaired and assembled by themselves. While installing, this workshop trained apprentices, enabling them to quickly master operating techniques.

In the process of construction, the workers launched a vigorous technical revolution, overcoming difficulties such as insufficient equipment and materials, a small workforce, and weak technical strength. The workers of the Guangzhou Municipal Machinery Installation Company, who undertook the construction of the small synthetic ammonia workshop, had never even seen a gas holder, but they emancipated their minds, worked hard and cleverly, and made and installed two gas holders with a diameter of seven meters, a height of four and a half meters, and made of three-millimeter steel plates by themselves, with the quality fully meeting the requirements. In the hoisting process, the workers used local "Ba Gan" (simple cranes) instead of foreign "Ba Gan" for hoisting, creating good experience for installing similar equipment in rural areas. In the case of insufficient equipment and material supply, the workers reformed the technological process and tried every means to solve the problems by substituting, finding, exchanging, urging, and borrowing. For example, more than 12,000 wooden grids needed to be placed in the transformation desulfurization tower, but due to the tight schedule and the lack of wood supply, the workers proposed to replace them with ceramic rings, which solved the problem. The workers of the phosphate fertilizer workshop adopted new technologies and new processes to overcome the weak links in capital construction and production. The construction area was reduced by 57.52% compared with the original plan, saving steel by 57.76%, cement by more than 100 tons, and saving investment by 41.07%. In order to solve the difficulty of raw materials and create conditions for rapid construction, the workers implemented the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously engaged in the production of raw materials. Now the plant already has a considerable-scale brick factory, cement workshop, and smelting workshop.

### 集中力量　突击重点　支援农业生产  广州氮肥厂加速建设进度

    集中力量　突击重点　支援农业生产
    广州氮肥厂加速建设进度
    据南方日报消息　广州氮肥厂坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，积极采取措施，加快基本建设速度，力求化肥早日出厂。现在，这个厂的大型合成氨车间和磷肥车间正在加紧建设。
    广州氮肥厂是华南化学工业基地之一，以生产化肥为主，分期建成。从1958年下半年开始动工兴建到现在，主要车间之一——大型的合成氨车间，正在加紧主要厂房施工；年产八万吨的硫酸车间已于去年建成投入生产。为了支援农业生产，去年第四季度确定增建的两个化肥车间，其中过磷酸钙车间，主要厂房正在紧张施工，不久即可建成投入生产；年产八百吨的小合成氨车间，目前正准备试生产。
    为了早日出产化肥，这个厂采取积极措施加快施工进度。厂里成立专门抢建小组，分别轻重缓急，安排工程进度，保证基本建设进度有计划有重点地完成。坚持边基建、边安装、边生产、边改革的做法，既加快了建设速度，又培养了人材。如小合成氨车间的高压部分正在进行土建时，低压部分已经开始安装。这个车间的二十五台运转设备，有二十一台是自己动手修理装配的。这个车间一边安装，一边培训学徒，使学徒迅速掌握操作技术。
    在兴建过程中，职工们大闹技术革命，克服了设备材料不足，人力少、技术力量薄弱等困难。承建小合成氨车间的广州市机械安装公司职工，有些人连气柜都没见过，但是他们解放思想，苦干巧干，自己动手把两个直径七米、高四点五米、用三毫米钢板造的气柜制成和安装起来，质量完全符合要求。在吊装过程中，职工们用土“巴杆”代替洋“巴杆”来吊装，为在农村安装同类设备创造出好经验。在设备材料供应不够充裕的情况下，职工们改革工艺流程，千方百计用代、找、换、催、借等办法解决。如变换脱硫塔内要安放一万二千多条木格，但因工期紧，木材供应不上，职工们就提议用瓷环来代替解决了问题。磷肥车间职工采用新工艺、新技术攻破了基建和生产中的薄弱环节，建筑面积比原定计划缩小57.52％，节约钢材达57.76％、水泥一百多吨，节约投资达41.07％。为了解决原材料的困难，为快速施工创设条件，职工们贯彻自力更生、土洋并举的方针，大搞原料材料生产。现在全厂已经拥有一个相当规模的砖厂、水泥车间和冶炼车间。
