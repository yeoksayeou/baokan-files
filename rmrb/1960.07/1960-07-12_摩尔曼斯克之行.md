Murmansk Trip
By Li Nan, our correspondent

　　We traveled by train through the Karelian Autonomous Republic to visit Murmansk. The Kola Peninsula, where the Murmansk Oblast is located, is a prime example of the Soviet Union conquering nature and transforming the far north through human effort. A once desolate and uninhabited area has become a powerful and prosperous industrial region. This area, located on the northwestern border of the Soviet Union, has attracted people's attention and interest.

　　The Pearl of the Far North

　　The electrified express train on the world's northernmost railway line carries passengers northward, passing through stretches of forests and swamps, interspersed with countless lakes and increasing amounts of tundra and mountains. The train stops at emerging industrial cities along the way. In the dawn light, we arrived in Murmansk on the Barents Sea Bay. Cranes and factory chimneys formed a dark mass on the bay shore, and giant ships were anchored far into the bay. On the hillside by the shore was a scene of a thriving city.

　　Murmansk is the largest city and largest industrial area, the largest fishing center and port in the Soviet Union and in the world. The harsh Arctic Circle and the warm Atlantic currents, these two brushes of nature with contrasting tones, have painted a strange landscape here. The climate here is harsh, yet relatively mild. It truly snows in June, but it rains in January. Here, the north wind not only brings severe cold, but also warmth from time to time. When severe cold comes here, migratory birds do not fly south, but fly north. Here, when the temperature drops to more than thirty degrees below zero, the coast is still turbulent. Murmansk is located in the world's harsh Arctic region, but it is a port that does not freeze all year round. The natural conditions here are much harsher than those of the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Azov Sea, which are three or four thousand kilometers further south, but when the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Azov Sea are bound by solid ice, shipping can continue here without interruption. In winter, the sea waves crash against the ships coming in and out, but the seawater freezes into layers of ice as soon as it hits the sailors' clothes, and freezes into icicles as soon as it hits the deck of the ship.

　　Murmansk is indeed a wonderful region in the world. In terms of area, the entire Murmansk Oblast has 140,000 square kilometers of land, slightly smaller than the United Kingdom. But before the revolution, the entire region had only 8,000 residents, so it was called "a land where birds are not startled." The Tsarist government only exiled the rebels of Razin, Pugachev, and the Decembrists to this region. The Tsarist government officials regarded this wonderful region as a hopeless wasteland, and regarded this northwestern border area as land that could be sold cheaply like Alaska in the easternmost part. Now, the Soviet people call Murmansk the pearl of the Far North.

　　Leading Production

　　Murmansk Oblast is an important industrial region of the Soviet Union. Comrade Kolovalov, chairman of the Oblast Executive Committee, introduced us to the achievements of Murmansk Oblast in developing industrial production. In terms of output, this oblast exceeds the republics of Moldova, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Lithuania, and also ranks among the top in the oblasts of the Russian Federation. Almost all major sectors of light and heavy industry have been established, with non-ferrous metals, industrial, chemical, meat product, and power industries occupying important positions. It is indeed an amazing achievement to build such a highly developed industrial base within the Arctic Circle.

　　The establishment of the chemical city of Kirovsk in Murmansk Oblast demonstrates the Soviet people's spirit of not fearing difficulties in those years. On New Year's Eve in 1929, late at night, in a small wooden house on a rocky mountainside, Kirov presided over a meeting. The Party sent Kirov to study the possibility of developing apatite deposits and establishing a chemical industry. At that time, there was no manpower, no machines, and no roads. There were no traces of inhabitants north to the Arctic Ocean, and south and east to the White Sea, only 30 kilometers to the west on the railway line. All the surrounding conditions seemed to give a negative answer to the question of establishing an industrial base here, but the Party gave a positive answer. It was imperative to establish a phosphate fertilizer base in the mountains within the Arctic Circle to break free from dependence on foreign countries. Local comrades told us: The construction of the chemical industry in Murmansk Oblast was once a target of ridicule by foreign capitalists.

　　But the wisdom and creativity of the people are great after all. In less than a year, Kirovsk produced the first batch of 100,000 tons of apatite ore. After another three years, the apatite ore produced was already able to meet the needs of the entire country, and phosphate fertilizer was no longer imported from foreign countries.

　　The speed of construction like Kirovsk was the result of the entire Party and the entire people building the border area with all their strength. The older generation of Murmansk residents told us about this enthusiasm for national construction. There was no manpower, but as soon as the Party called, personnel came from all directions across the country: sailors from the Black Sea came from Odessa, fishermen from the Caspian Sea came from Astrakhan, metallurgists came from Leningrad, and prospectors came from the Urals. There was no machinery and equipment, boilers were shipped from Ukraine, generators were shipped from Moscow, wheat was shipped from the Volga River basin, and timber was shipped from Arkhangelsk. People who saw the construction scene that year pointed out to us: This is a construction in which the people of the whole country are going all out, and it is a construction of one city after another at once.

　　Following Kirovsk, Monchegorsk, a non-ferrous metal production base within the Arctic Circle, was born in the wilderness where there was nothing. In 1938, a large-scale copper-nickel joint factory was completed and began to supply this valuable non-ferrous metal to the whole country. After the war, Monchegorsk also established an aluminum industry.

　　Now, the Soviet people of Murmansk Oblast are still continuing the enthusiasm of the past builders, building new cities and industrial bases one after another. Olenegorsk, Zhdanovsk... These are all new cities that cannot be found on the map yet. Olenegorsk is a base for iron ore production. In 1954, an iron mine and concentrator were built here. Iron ore within the Arctic Circle supports the steel production in the interior.

　　The Soviet people used the numerous lakes and short rivers in Murmansk Oblast to build several of the world's northernmost large hydropower stations. Now the electricity produced in this oblast is equal to the total electricity production of the entire Tsarist Russia before the revolution. This stark contrast, along with the factories and power stations visited here for a few days, explained to us the magnificent achievements of the Soviet people in developing the Kola Peninsula.

　　A Port That Never Freezes

　　People who visit Murmansk must visit the port and go to the ice-free bay. We took a motorboat on the bay and enjoyed the majestic appearance of this ice-free port. The bay is 70 meters deep, and any ship can dock. Hundreds of giant ships enter and exit here every year, and labor life is always boiling, unlike other Arctic ports, which become cold and stagnant in winter.

　　This is one of the five major ports in the Soviet Union. The activity center of the Northern Merchant Marine Fleet. The starting point of the Soviet Great Northern Route. Now, the ships of the Northern Merchant Marine Fleet are all operating in the southern oceans. After waiting for this long voyage to return, they will participate in the northern shipping season. The residents of Murmansk call their port "a port of four oceans" and call their city a city of seafarers.

　　Comrade Galinin, the chief engineer of the commercial port, introduced us to the whole picture of this northern port. On the fifteen wharves that stretch for several kilometers, there are almost no workers, because the degree of mechanization here is very high, and it has reached the stage of concentrating all loading and unloading work in the central dispatch room. In the first section of the commercial port, Comrade Galinin told us: Before 1955, each shift in the entire section had 80 workers, and they loaded and unloaded 4,000 tons per day and night. Now, each shift has only 12 personnel, and they load and unload 1,000 tons per hour. In addition to the use of cranes, an automatic loading and unloading production line has been established to completely automate the loading and unloading work.

　　The Murmansk seaport has two high and low tides every day, and the water level rises and falls by four and a half meters each time. The warm current brought about by this rise and fall overcomes the arctic ice. This ice-free port was desolate for many years. The Soviet people built the north and fully utilized its power to serve the welfare of the people.

　　Fishing on the Barents Sea

　　Murmansk is the largest fishing center in the Soviet Union, with an annual output accounting for three-quarters of the entire Soviet output. Before the revolution, the fish products here could only account for 1% of the country. From 1% to three-quarters, the rapid rate of development can be imagined.

　　Murmansk's fishing grounds are mainly the Barents Sea. The Atlantic warm current brings abundant life to the Barents Sea, with abundant fish reserves and many varieties. The Soviet people who built the northern border area established a strong fishing fleet and fish industry in Murmansk.

　　We visited a fishing boat of the trawler fleet that had just returned recently, the "Zhigulevsk" . This is a modern diesel-electric large fishing boat. The ship is 78 meters long and 13 meters wide. One fishing boat is equivalent to a fish product processing factory, which directly processes the fish caught into canned food, frozen fish, or salted fish. As soon as the fishing boat returns to the dock, the fish products are directly loaded from the boat and transported to all parts of the country. The Murmansk trawler fleet is not only the largest trawler fleet in the Soviet Union but also in the world.

　　The ship goes to sea for about two months each time, and then returns to shore for more than ten days of rest before going to sea again. In the past, fishing had to wait for the fish season. The fish season in fisheries is equal to the autumn harvest season in agriculture. When the fish season arrives, fishing boats go out to sea one after another, like celebrating a festival. The fishing workers in Murmansk have long broken this tradition. They are active in the ocean all year round. They are not waiting for fish schools, but are looking for fish schools in the vast ocean. They do not leave the ocean only in June, July, and August, but also in November, December, January, and February.

　　The Soviet Union has conducted long-term, detailed, and extensive research on the Barents Sea. We visited the Marine Fisheries Science Research Institute here, which is a research center. The research institute has three scientific research ships that study the laws of fish schools at sea all year round and provide detailed materials to various fishing boats. With abundant materials on the activities of fish schools, it is not difficult for fishing boats to find fish schools in the boundless ocean and return fully loaded.

　　The Murmansk Fishery Workers' Club is brightly lit, and fishery workers are talking to us about the living conditions of fishing at sea. The Arctic Ocean is a friend of fishery workers, and also their enemy. Severe cold, strong winds, violent waves, and thick fog are the lifelong companions of fishermen on the ocean, but regardless of these difficulties and obstacles, Murmansk's fishery workers have been active in areas close to the Arctic center, expanding their scope of activities in the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.

　　The Murmansk Fish Joint Factory is the largest fishery factory in the Soviet Union. This factory has more than 8,000 workers and produces hundreds of thousands of quintals of fish every year, supplying all parts of the country. This factory has its own fleet, docks, cold storage, and factory buildings that stretch for several kilometers. Before the factory was built, this was a barren beach.

　　Murmansk Oblast has been transformed from a desolate border area into a region with thriving industries and fully developed people's cultural and economic life. This prosperous border area of socialist society has been developed through hard work and diligent work on the basis of 8,000 people. Now Murmansk Oblast has 560,000 people, and their industrious hands will surely make the future communist construction work develop more rapidly.

　　摩尔曼斯克之行
　　本报记者　李楠
    我们乘坐火车穿过卡累利自治共和国到摩尔曼斯克来访问。摩尔曼斯克州所在的科拉半岛是苏联用人力征服自然，改造极北边区的一个最突出的范例。一向荒凉的渺无人迹的地带变成了强大繁荣的工业地区。位于苏联西北边陲的这块地方引起了人们的注意和兴趣。
          极北地区的珍珠
    这条世界上最北的铁路干线上的电气化快速火车载着旅客往北奔驰，沿途是一片片的森林和沼泽地带，间杂着数不清的湖泊和越来越多的苔原和山峦。火车沿途停站的地方都是新兴的工业城市。在晨光曙色中，到达了巴伦支海湾上的摩尔曼斯克。海湾岸上，起重机和工厂烟囱成了黑压压的一片，巨型轮船一直停泊到了海湾的远处。在岸边山坡上是一派繁荣城市的景象。
    摩尔曼斯克是苏联也是世界上最北的最大城市和最大工业区，最大的渔业中心和港口。冷酷的北极圈和温暖的大西洋暖流，这两支大自然色调截然相反的画笔交错地在这里涂上了奇异的景色。这里的气候是酷寒的，同时又是比较温和的。这里真正6月会飞雪，但正月却又会下雨。这里北风不仅意味着带来严寒，时时还带来温暖。这里当严寒来时，候鸟不飞向南方，却向北方飞去。这里当温度冷到零下三十多度的时候，海岸上却仍然是波涛汹涌。摩尔曼斯克处在世界上酷寒的北极地区，但却又是常年不冻的港口。这里的自然条件比远在南方三、四千公里以外的地区里海、黑海、亚速海要严酷得多，但是当里海、黑海和亚速海被坚冰束缚的时候，这里可以航运不断。冬天海波冲击着进进出出的轮船，但是海水一冲上了海员们的衣服就会结成冰层，一冲上轮船的甲板，就会结成一条条的冰棱。
    摩尔曼斯克确是世界上一块奇妙的地区。就面积论，整个的摩尔曼斯克州有十四万平方公里的土地，稍小于英国。但在革命前，整个地区只有八千居民，因此被称为“鸟飞不惊的国土”。沙皇政府只把拉辛、普格乔夫和十二月党人的起义者们流放到这个地区。沙皇政府的官吏们把这块奇妙的地区认为是毫无希望的荒岛，把这块最西北部的边陲看成可以像最东部的阿拉斯加一样应该用贱价卖掉的土地。现在，苏联人民称呼摩尔曼斯克是极北地区的珍珠。
        名列前茅的生产
    摩尔曼斯克州是苏联的一个重要的工业区域。州执行委员会主席科洛瓦洛夫同志向我们介绍了摩尔曼斯克州发展工业生产的成绩。就产量而言，这个州超过了摩尔达维亚、亚美尼亚、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克、土库曼和立陶宛等共和国，在俄罗斯联邦各州内也是名列在前面。轻重工业各主要部门几乎都建立起来了，有色金属、工业、化学工业、肉产品工业、动力工业更占着重要的地位。在北极圈内，建成这样一个高度发展的工业基地确是一件惊人的成就。
    摩尔曼斯克州的化学城基洛夫斯克建立的经过表现了苏联人民不怕困难的当年的气魄。1929年除夕的深夜，在山丛半岩上的一间小木屋里，基洛夫在主持一个会议。党派基洛夫来研究开发磷灰石矿藏建立化学工业的可能性。当时没有人力、没有机器，没有道路。向北一直到北冰洋，向南向东一直到白海，都没有一个居民的足迹，只有向西三十公里的铁路线上才有居民。周围的一切条件似乎都对在这里建立工业基地的问题提出否定的回答，但是党却提出了肯定的回答。一定要在北极圈内的山丛中建立磷肥基地，摆脱对外国的依赖。当地的同志告诉我们：在摩尔曼斯克州建设化学工业当时曾是外国资本家们的一个嘲笑对象。
    但是人民的智慧和创造毕竟是伟大的。不到一年的时间，基洛夫斯克就出产了第一批十万吨磷灰石矿。再经过三年出产的磷灰石矿就已经能够满足全国的需要，不再从外国进口磷肥。
    像基洛夫斯克这样建设的速度是全党全民全力建设边区的结果。老一代摩尔曼斯克的居民向我们叙述了这种全民建设的热情。没有人力罢，党一号召就从全国四面八方来了人员：从敖德萨来了黑海上的水手，从阿斯特拉罕来了里海上的捕鱼人，从列宁格勒来了冶金匠，从乌拉尔来了探矿师。没有机器设备罢，从乌克兰运来了锅炉，从莫斯科运来了发电机，从伏尔加河流域运来了小麦，从阿尔汗格尔斯克运来了木材。看见过当年建设情景的人向我们指出：这是一种全国人民全力以赴的建设，是一下子一个城市接着一个城市的建设。
    紧接着基洛夫斯克之后，一个北极圈内有色金属生产的基地蒙契戈尔斯克又在一无所有的荒原上诞生了。1938年一个规模宏大的铜镍联合工厂建成，开始向全国供应这种贵重的有色金属。战后，蒙契戈尔斯克还建立了制铝工业。
    现在，摩尔曼斯克州的苏联人民仍然继续过去建设者的热情，一个接着一个地建设新的城市和工业基地。奥林列戈尔斯克、日丹诺夫斯克……这些都是在地图上还找不到的新城市。奥林列戈尔斯克是铁矿生产的基地。1954年这里建成了铁矿场和选矿厂。北极圈内的铁矿支援了内地的钢铁生产。
    苏联人民利用摩尔曼斯克州内的众多的湖泊和短促的河流建成了好几座世界上最北的大水电站。现在这个州所生产的电力等于革命前整个沙皇俄国电力生产的总和。这个鲜明的对比，连同几天在这里参观的工厂和电站，一并给我们说明了苏联人民开发科拉半岛的雄伟成就。
        永不冻结的港口
    到摩尔曼斯克参观的人都要访问港口和到不冻的海湾上去。我们乘着汽艇在海湾上饱览了这个不冻港口的雄姿。海湾水深七十米，任何轮船都能停泊。每年数以百计的巨型轮船在这里进出，终年都沸腾着劳动的生活，不像其他北冰洋港口，一到冬天就冷寂停顿下来了。
    这里是苏联五大港口之一。北方商船队的活动中心。苏联大北方航线的起点。现在，北方商船队的船只都正在南方海洋上活动。等待这次远航回来后，就参加北方航运季节。摩尔曼斯克的居民称自己的港口是“四洋之港”，称自己的城市是航海者的城市。
    商港总工程师加里宁同志把这座北方大港的全貌介绍给我们。在长达几公里的十五个码头上，几乎看不到工人，因为这里的机械化程度很高，已达到将一切装卸工作都集中在中央调度室管理的阶段。在商港的第一工段，加里宁同志告诉我们：还在1955年前，全工段每个轮班有八十个工人，每昼夜装卸四千吨，现在每个轮班只有十二个人员，每小时就装卸一千吨。除了运用起重机之外，还建立了自动化装卸工作线，把装卸工作完全自动化了。
    摩尔曼斯克海港每天涨潮退潮两次，每次水面升降四米半。这种涨落所带来的暖流战胜了北极的寒冰。这个不冻港过去荒凉了多少年代，苏联人民建设了北方，才充分利用了它的力量来为人民的福利服务。
        巴伦支海上捕鱼
    摩尔曼斯克是苏联最大的渔业中心，每年产量占苏联整个产量的四分之三。革命前这里的鱼产品只能占全国的1％。从1％到四分之三，发展速度的迅速也就可想而知了。
    摩尔曼斯克的渔场主要是巴伦支海。大西洋暖流给巴伦支海带来了丰富的生命，鱼藏量丰富，种类繁多。建设北国边疆的苏联人民在摩尔曼斯克建立了强大的捕鱼船队和鱼类工业。
    我们参观了一只刚回来不久的曳网船队的捕鱼船
  “日古里夫斯克”号。这是一艘近代化的柴油电动大型鱼船。船长七十八米，阔十三米。一只鱼船就等于一座鱼产品加工工厂，把打上来的鱼直接就制作成罐头、冻鱼或咸鱼。鱼船一回到码头，鱼产品就从船上直接装车，运到全国各地。摩尔曼斯克的曳网船队不仅是苏联而且也是全世界最大的曳网船队。
    船只每次出海大约两个月时间，以后回岸休息十多天，又再度出海。过去捕鱼要等待鱼汛季节。渔业中的鱼汛时期等于农业中的秋收时节。鱼汛期到来，鱼船纷纷出海，有如度节。摩尔曼斯克的捕鱼工人们早已打破了这个传统，他们整年都在海洋上活动，他们不是等待鱼群，而是在辽阔的海洋上去寻找鱼群。他们不只是6、7、8月，而是11月、12月、1月、2月都不离开海洋。
    苏联在巴伦支海上进行了长期的、细致的、广泛的研究工作。我们访问了这里的海洋渔业科学研究所，就是一个研究中心。研究所有三只科学研究船只，终年在海上研究鱼群的规律，供给各个捕鱼船只详细的材料。捕鱼船只有了丰富的鱼群活动的材料之后，就不难在一望无际的海洋上找到鱼群，满载而归。
    摩尔曼斯克渔业职工俱乐部灯火辉煌，渔业工人们和我们谈到在海洋上捕鱼的生活状况。北极海洋是渔业工人们的朋友，也是他们的敌人。严寒、巨风、恶浪、浓雾是海洋上打鱼人的终身的伴侣，但是不管这些艰难险阻，摩尔曼斯克的渔业工人一直活动到了靠近北极中心的地区，在北大西洋上和北冰洋上扩大着活动范围。
    摩尔曼斯克的鱼类联合工厂是苏联最大的一个渔业工厂。这个工厂有八千多名工人，每年生产的数十万公担鱼类，供应全国各地。这个工厂拥有自己的船队、码头、冷藏库、厂房绵延几公里。在建厂之前，这里是一片荒滩。
    摩尔曼斯克州由一个荒凉边区变成了一个百业兴盛，人民文化经济生活充分发展的地区。这个社会主义社会的繁荣边区是在八千人口的基础上下勤劳苦干发展起来的。现在摩尔曼斯克州已有五十六万人口，他们的勤劳的双手一定会使今后的共产主义建设工作更加迅速地开展。
