Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: Under the instigation of the United States, the Organization of American States (OAS) Council, at its meeting in Washington on the 18th, passed a proposal put forward by Peru to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of OAS member states. This is under the guise of the so-called "international communist threat" to plan a large-scale intervention in Cuba.

This proposal indicates that the purpose of convening this meeting of foreign ministers is to consider the so-called "defense of the regional system and the democratic principles of the Americas." In reality, the so-called "system" and "principles" are tools for the United States to enslave Latin America.

U.S. representative Dreier spoke at the meeting, expressing "welcome" and "support" for the above proposal. He falsely accused the Soviet Union's just stance of supporting the Cuban people against U.S. aggression as "interfering in the affairs of this hemisphere," and clamored for "vigorously maintaining" the Pan-American organization, which the United States uses to suppress and enslave the people of Latin American countries. Dreier also clamored that Cuba's accusation against the United States in the United Nations was a "challenging" violation of the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" and the OAS Charter, and advocated intervention in Cuba by the OAS.

The meeting appointed a seven-nation committee composed of representatives from El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, and Chile to determine the date, location, agenda, and rules of procedure for the meeting of foreign ministers of OAS member states.

Cuban representative Carlos Lechuga stated at the meeting that Cuba's attitude would be uncertain until the agenda and location of the foreign ministers' meeting were determined.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to a TASS report from New York on the 18th: The "York Daily Record," published in York, Pennsylvania, published an article by prominent American columnist Drew Pearson entitled "Military Suggests Sending Marines to Invade Cuba." The article said, "The Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington are putting forward one of the most important proposals since the war. They are advising President Eisenhower to use military force to attack Cuba before it is too late. They are recommending sending Marines and paratroopers to occupy the entire island (referring to Cuba)."

    操纵美洲国家组织理事会通过秘鲁建议
    美国阴谋进一步干涉古巴
    美国军方建议向古巴武装进攻
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国策动下，美洲国家组织18日在华盛顿举行的理事会会议上，通过了由秘鲁出面提出的关于召开美洲国家组织成员国外长会议，以便在所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的幌子下策划大规模干涉古巴的建议。
  这项建议表明，召开这次外长会议的目的，在于考虑所谓“保卫区域制度和美洲民主原则问题”，而这里所谓的“制度”和“原则”实际上就是美国奴役拉丁美洲的工具。
    美国代表德赖尔在会上发言，表示“欢迎”和“拥护”上述建议。他诬蔑苏联采取的支持古巴人民反对美国侵略的严正立场是“干预本半球的事务”，叫嚷必须“大力维护”美国用来镇压和奴役拉丁美洲国家人民的泛美机构。德赖尔还叫嚷古巴在联合国中控诉美国是一种“具有挑战性”的违反“泛美互助条约”和美洲国家组织宪章的行动，鼓吹由美洲国家组织对古巴进行干预。
    会议任命了一个由萨尔瓦多、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、乌拉圭、巴西和智利代表组成的七国委员会，来确定举行美洲国家组织成员国外长会议的日期、地点、议程和规章。
  古巴代表卡洛斯·莱丘加在会上表示，在确定这次外长会议的议程和地点之前，古巴的态度将是不肯定的。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：在美国宾夕法尼亚州约克出版的“新闻日报”刊载了美国著名专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊写的一篇题为“军方建议出动海军陆战队进攻古巴”的文章。文章说，“华盛顿的参谋长联席会议正在提出战后以来最重要的一项建议。它劝告艾森豪威尔总统在还不太晚的时候使用军事力量攻击古巴。他们建议出动海军陆战队和伞兵占领整个岛屿（指古巴）。”
