Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 5th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on July 5th that twelve members of the Indonesian Cooperation Parliament from West Irian recently issued a joint statement on the attitude of American and Dutch imperialists towards West Irian, demanding that the Indonesian government quickly take a firm stance to deal with these two imperialist powers.

The statement said that the United States' attitude towards West Irian is becoming increasingly shameless. It not only openly helps Dutch colonialists, allowing the Dutch to use American weapons against the Indonesian people, but also recklessly expresses its intention to establish military bases in West Irian. The statement pointed out that the attitude adopted by the United States directly threatens the Republic of Indonesia and world peace.

The statement demanded that a firm attitude be adopted to deal with those countries that support the Netherlands.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 6th: According to a report in the Indonesian "People's Daily" today, the Central Committee of the Indonesian University Students' Union sent a delegation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 5th, demanding that the government take resolute measures against the United States regarding its attitude towards West Irian.

The student delegation pointed out to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States is not neutral on the West Irian issue, but is biased towards the Dutch colonialists.

The delegation pointed out the following facts: the United States allows the Netherlands to use American weapons to strengthen West Irian's "defense"; senior U.S. Navy officer Burke openly said he wanted to establish military bases in West Irian; some ringleaders of the Indonesian rebel group held a meeting in Bangkok under the direction of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, headed by the United States.

The delegation demanded that the Indonesian government, in accordance with the political manifesto of the Republic of Indonesia, take over the capital of countries that help the Netherlands in Indonesia, and protest against the remarks of U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Burke.
