Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 28th: Shanghai is experiencing intense heat, with the highest temperatures since July consistently remaining around 36 degrees Celsius. This hot summer brings particularly heavy heatstroke prevention and cooling tasks to the rapidly developing pig farming industry. In recent days, the eleven counties, led by the secretaries in charge of animal husbandry, have seen cadres from all levels of the animal husbandry front rushing to pig farms to fight the high temperatures alongside the breeders.

In the heatstroke prevention and cooling work in pig farms, all counties regard improving the living conditions of pigs as an important element. According to relevant departments' investigations, the temperature inside a soft pen is 3 to 5 degrees Celsius higher than a hard pen; rinsing a pig pen with well water lowers the temperature by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius compared to rinsing with river water; a pig pen with ventilation on all four sides is 3 to 4 degrees Celsius cooler than a pig pen with ventilation on only one side. Therefore, at the beginning of the heatstroke prevention and cooling battle in pig farms, cadres at all levels led breeders to transform soft pens into hard pens, dig earthen wells for rinsing pig pens, and open windows in pig pens. At the same time, they also built sheds in pig farms to provide shade, and sprinkled lime water or covered straw on the roofs of pig pens with tile or asphalt felt roofs to reduce radiant heat, trying to lower the temperature of pig pens in many ways. After a concentrated effort in Songjiang County, within a few days, more than 21,000 soft pens in pig farms throughout the county had been converted into hard pens. According to statistics from nine communes in Jiading County, pig farms have already dug 220 earthen wells.

Due to the higher temperatures, the appetite of pigs is not as strong as usual. For this reason, all county pig farms have adopted changing feeding methods as a measure for heatstroke prevention and cooling. Pig farms in Shanghai County widely implement the feeding method of cooked food cooled before feeding, feeding small amounts frequently. Breeders painstakingly wash and finely chop aquatic peanuts, water hyacinths, and duckweed, and add this kind of juicy, fresh green feed to pigs at noon when the temperature is highest, to increase the water and nutrients needed by the pigs.

    保证猪只在高温季节健康生长
    上海郊区猪场大力防暑降温
    据新华社上海28日电　上海酷暑，7月份以来的最高温度一直保持在摄氏三十六度左右。炎夏给大发展中的养猪事业带来格外繁重的防暑降温任务。连日来，十一个县由领导畜牧业的书记带头，各级畜牧战线干部纷纷奔赴养猪场，同饲养员一起大战高温。
    在养猪场防暑降温工作中，各县把改善猪只的居住条件作为一个重要内容。据有关部门调查，软圈内的温度比硬圈的要高摄氏三到五度，用井水冲洗猪圈比用河水冲洗温度要降低摄氏一、二度；四面通风的猪圈比一面通风的猪圈温度要低摄氏三、四度。因此，养猪场防暑降温战斗一开始，各级干部就率领饲养员大改软圈为硬圈，大挖冲洗猪圈用的土水井，在猪圈中大开窗户，同时又在猪场搭凉棚遮阴，在瓦顶和油毛毡顶的猪圈屋上洒石灰水或复盖稻草，以减少辐射热，从多方面设法降低猪圈温度。松江县各公社经过突击，短短几天内，全县养猪场的软圈，已有二万一千多间改成了硬圈。嘉定县据九个公社的统计，养猪场已经挖掘土水井二百二十口。
    由于气温较高，猪只食欲也不及平时旺盛。为此，各县养猪场都把改变喂食方法，作为防暑降温的一项措施。上海县各养猪场广泛实行熟食凉喂、少喂勤添的喂食方法。饲养员们不辞辛苦把水花生、水浮莲、水葫芦等洗净切细，在中午气温最高的时候给猪加喂这一类多汁、鲜嫩的青料，以增加猪所需要的水份和营养。
