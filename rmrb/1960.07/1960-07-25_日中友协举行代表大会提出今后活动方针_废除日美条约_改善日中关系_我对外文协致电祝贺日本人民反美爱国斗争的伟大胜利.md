Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan-China Friendship Association today convened its three-day 10th National Congress in Tokyo to commemorate the organization's 10th anniversary and prepare to pass its future activity guidelines. Three hundred delegates from all over Japan attended the congress.

    In his speech at the congress, Japan-China Friendship Association Chairman Jiichiro Matsumoto emphasized that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an obstacle to Japan-China friendship and improving Japan-China relations. In discussing the association's contribution to the opposition of the "Security Treaty," Matsumoto said that the association clarified the relationship between the "Security Treaty" issue and Japan-China relations, thereby greatly promoting the national movement against the "Security Treaty."

    Matsumoto called on members to further strengthen their unity and exert their greatest efforts to fight for the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang treaty.

    Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Shigeo Kamiama, Central Committee Member of the Communist Party, Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Kenzo Nakajima, representative of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and leaders of organizations such as the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation all addressed the meeting.

    Association Secretary-General Toshizo Hasegawa then made a general report on the association's activities over the past year. He said that the association's branches and headquarters actively participated in the central and local national conferences to block the revision of the "Security Treaty." Through this activity, the association combined the movement to strive for friendship with China with the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    Hasegawa said that the association screened the Chinese films "The New Year's Sacrifice" and "Lin Zexu" two hundred times in the past year, with a total audience of 200,000 people. He said that approximately one million people viewed the Chinese cultural and industrial exhibition sponsored by the association.

    When discussing the association's organization, Hasegawa said that during the struggle against the "Security Treaty," the activities of the association's branches were greatly enlivened, and the number of members increased more and more. He said that fourteen new branches were established in the past year, and in four places such as Tokyo and Kyoto, the association's branches launched a movement to strive to double the number of members.

    Following the general report, Association Director-General Seyimin Miyazaki proposed this year's activity guidelines. He said that the goal of the Japan-China friendship movement is to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" because it is the main obstacle to the development of Japan-China friendly relations.

    Miyazaki emphasized: "In order to achieve this goal, the association should hold high the banner of friendship with China and restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and must unremittingly struggle to isolate the common enemies of the Japanese and Chinese people, namely U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism, and strengthen cooperation with all political parties that are loyal to Japan's democratic and neutral cause."

    Next, the congress elected a ten-member delegation, including Vice-Chairman Noriharu Yoshida, to request the government to immediately issue visas to Chinese representatives to attend the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's congress and the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sent a telegram of warm congratulations to the Japan-China Friendship Association today on the occasion of its 10th National Congress.

    The congratulatory telegram said, "On the occasion of the convocation of your association's 10th National Congress, our association, on behalf of the Chinese people, extends warm congratulations to your association and, through your association, to all members of your association and all Japanese people.

    "Over the ten years since its establishment, your association has made many unremitting efforts to strengthen friendly exchanges and cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan, and has already achieved great success. In the past year or more, in the Japanese people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents and against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, your association has closely combined the Japan-China friendship movement with the Japanese people's current anti-American patriotic just struggle, further consolidating and developing the militant friendship established between our two peoples in the struggle against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, and has made beneficial contributions to the cause of defending world peace."

    The telegram said: "In the past year or more, the Japanese people's twenty-one magnificent national unified actions and several large-scale general strikes have rejected Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan and at the same time forced the agent of U.S. imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, to step down. This is a great and brilliant victory. The victory of the Japanese people's struggle is a great encouragement and support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, for world peace, and for the construction of socialism."

    The telegram pointed out that the current international struggle situation is very favorable for the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, freedom, and neutrality. Now, the bugle call for the Japanese people's twenty-second unified action has sounded again. Each of your unified actions will gather greater strength to strike at the Japanese and American reactionaries, and is a step forward towards final victory. We firmly believe that the people of China and Japan united, and the people of the world united, struggling together, will certainly be able to sever the aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism and establish friendly relations and lasting peace between the people of all countries.

    日中友协举行代表大会提出今后活动方针
    废除日美条约  改善日中关系
    我对外文协致电祝贺日本人民反美爱国斗争的伟大胜利
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会今天在东京召开为时三天的第十次全国代表大会，纪念这个组织成立十周年，并准备通过今后的活动方针。出席大会的有来自日本全国各地的三百名代表。
    日中友好协会会长松本治一郎在大会上讲话时强调指出，新日美“安全条约”是妨碍日中友好和妨碍改善日中关系的障碍。松本在谈到协会对反对“安全条约”的贡献时说，协会阐明了“安全条约”问题和日中关系问题之间的关系，从而大大促进了全国反对“安全条约”的运动。
    松本要求会员们进一步加强团结，拿出最大的力量来进行斗争，争取废除新日美“安全条约”和日蒋条约。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，共产党中央委员神山茂夫，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁和日本—中国文化交流协会代表中岛健藏以及全日本农民协会联合会等团体的领导人都在会上致词。
    协会事务局长长谷川敏三接着作了关于协会过去一年来活动的总报告。他说，协会分会和总部积极参加了中央和地方阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议。协会通过这种活动就把争取同中国友好的运动同反对“安全条约”的斗争结合起来。
    长谷川说，协会在过去一年中放映了两百场中国电影“祝福”和“林则徐”，观众共达二十万人。他说，约一百万人观看了协会主办的中国文化和工业展览会。
    当谈到协会组织的时候，长谷川说，在反对“安全条约”的斗争期间，协会分会的活动大大活跃，会员人数愈来愈增加。他说，在过去一年中，新建立了十四个分会，在东京和京都等四个地方，协会分会展开了争取把会员人数增加一倍的运动。
    在总报告之后，协会理事长宫崎世民提出了今年的活动方针。他说，日中友好运动的目标是废除新日美“安全条约”，因为它是发展日中友好关系的主要障碍。
    宫崎强调说：“为了实现这个目的，协会应当高举起同中国友好和恢复日中邦交的旗帜，必须不懈地为孤立日本和中国人民的共同敌人即美帝国主义和日本军国主义而斗争，加强同忠于日本的民主和中立事业的一切政党合作。”
    接着，大会选出包括副会长吉田法晴在内的十人代表团，向政府要求立即发签证给中国代表前来参加日本工会总评议会的代表大会和第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。
    新华社23日讯　日本日中友好协会今天召开第十次全国大会，中国人民对外文化协会致电表示热烈祝贺。
    贺电说，“值此贵会召开第十次全国大会之际，我会谨代表中国人民，向贵会并通过贵会向贵会全体会员和全体日本人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    “贵会成立十年来，坚持不懈地为加强中日两国人民的友好往来和文化交流作了许多努力，并且已经取得了巨大的成绩。最近一年多来，贵会在日本人民反对美帝国主义及其代理人、反对日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争中，把日中友好运动同日本人民当前的反美爱国正义斗争紧密地结合起来，进一步巩固和发展了我们两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中所建立起来的战斗友谊，为保卫世界和平事业作出了有益的贡献。”
    电报说：“一年多来，日本人民二十一次波澜壮阔的全国统一行动和数次规模巨大的总罢工，拒绝了艾森豪威尔的“访问”日本，同时把美帝国主义的代理人岸信介赶下台。这是伟大的辉煌的胜利。日本人民斗争的胜利，对于中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，争取世界和平，建设社会主义事业是一个极大的鼓舞和支持。”
    电报指出，目前，国际斗争形势十分有利于日本人民争取独立民主自由和中立的斗争。现在，日本人民第二十二次统一行动的号角又响起来了。你们的每一次统一行动都会集结更大的力量给日美反动派以打击，都是向最后胜利前进了一步。我们深信，中日两国人民联合起来，全世界人民联合起来，共同斗争，一定能够把美帝国主义的侵略魔爪斩断，建立各国人民之间的友好关系和持久和平。
