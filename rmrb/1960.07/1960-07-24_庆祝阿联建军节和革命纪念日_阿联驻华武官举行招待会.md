Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. Brigadier General Montagy, Military Attaché of the United Arab Republic to China, held a reception tonight to celebrate the UAE Armed Forces Day and Revolution Day.

General Yang Chengwu, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, attended the reception. In his speech, he congratulated the armed forces of the United Arab Republic. He said, "We hope and believe that the armed forces of the United Arab Republic will continue to contribute to defending the independence of their country and safeguarding the cause of peace in the future." General Yang Chengwu said: "The current situation is favorable to the cause of world peace and democracy, and a magnificent national democratic movement is sweeping Asia, Africa, and Latin America. From Cuba and Algeria to Japan, anti-imperialist storms are rising everywhere. U.S. imperialism has fallen into a predicament surrounded by enemies on all sides. Recently, U.S. imperialism has been intensifying its tyrannical interference against the Cuban people who are safeguarding their national independence, and threatening them with force, attempting to provoke war. U.S. imperialism has always supported the French imperialists in carrying out their heinous colonial war in Algeria, and is plotting and even personally engaging in interference against the Congolese people who have just won their independence."

General Yang Chengwu said that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggles waged by the people of Cuba, Algeria, and the Congo. The Chinese people stand firmly with the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the common struggle against imperialism, we will always support each other and cooperate closely.

Lieutenant Colonel Wu Bo, Deputy Military Attaché of the UAE to China, said in his speech that the United Arab Republic is now entering an important stage of economic construction and industrialization in order to achieve national prosperity and happiness. He said that we will spare no effort to contribute to the cause of peace for all people in the world. There will be no world peace without giving people freedom, returning inherent rights to them, and returning plundered land to its original owners. He pointed out that the moral and material assistance given by the People's Republic of China to our country has left a good and deep impression on the Arab people.

Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Lieutenant General Cheng Jun of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Liu Shao Wen, Major General Wang Xinggang, Major General Wei Tianlu, and Major General Chen Ruiting, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Deputy Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and Vice President of the Sino-Arab Friendship Association Zhang Tiesheng were invited to attend the reception tonight. Salah el-Din Tarazi, Ambassador of the UAE to China, as well as diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to China, also attended the reception.

    阿联驻华武官举行招待会
    新华社23日讯　阿拉伯联合共和国驻我国武官蒙大奇准将今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿联武装部队建军节和革命纪念日。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长杨成武上将出席了招待会。他在讲话中向阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队致贺。他说，我们希望和相信，阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队今后在保卫自己国家的独立和保卫和平事业中，将继续作出贡献。杨成武上将说：目前形势是有利于世界和平和民主事业的，波澜壮阔的民族民主运动正在席卷着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。从古巴、阿尔及利亚到日本，到处兴起了反帝国主义的风暴。美帝国主义已经陷入四面楚歌的困境。最近，美帝国主义正在加紧对维护民族独立的古巴人民进行横暴的干涉，并且以武力进行威胁，企图挑起战争。美帝国主义一直支持法帝国主义者在阿尔及利亚进行罪恶的殖民主义战争，并且正在阴谋策划、甚至亲自出马对刚刚赢得独立的刚果人民进行干涉。
    杨成武上将说，中国人民坚决支持古巴、阿尔及利亚和刚果人民所进行的正义斗争。中国人民坚定地同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民站在一起。我们在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，将永远互相支持，密切合作。
    阿联驻华副武官吴勃中校在会上致词中说，阿拉伯联合共和国目前开始进入经济建设和工业化的重要阶段，以求国家的富足和幸福。他说，我们要不遗余力地为全世界人民的和平事业作出贡献。不给人们以自由，不把固有的权利还给人家，不把被掠夺的土地归还原主，便绝不会有世界和平。他指出，中华人民共和国给予我国道义上和物质上的援助，在阿拉伯人民中留下了良好和深刻的印象。
    今晚应邀出席招待会的有成钧空军中将、刘少文中将、王兴纲少将、魏天禄少将、陈锐霆少将等中国人民解放军将领，外交部副部长罗贵波，北京市副市长吴晗，中阿友好协会副会长张铁生。阿联驻我国大使萨拉赫丁·塔拉齐以及各国驻华使节和武官都出席了招待会。
