Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. People from All Circles in the Capital Support the Congolese People's Conference Against Imperialist Aggression and Interference and in Defense of National Independence - Conference Telegram

    We, the people from all circles in the capital, are solemnly gathered here today to support the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against imperialist aggression and interference and in defense of national independence. We warmly endorse the statement issued by our government on July 19 regarding support for the Congolese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and interference. We express our boundless respect for the heroic spirit and fearless courage demonstrated by the Congolese people in their struggle; we express our extreme anger and strong protest against the armed aggression by Belgian colonialists and the intervention activities of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States.
    In order to maintain its colonial rule in the Congo, the Belgian colonialists have carried out a series of subversive and divisive activities against the newly born Republic of the Congo. When these activities were resisted by the Congolese people, they flagrantly launched an armed invasion of the Congo. The criminal acts of the Belgian colonialists are supported and encouraged by the imperialists headed by the United States. It is particularly worth noting that while the U.S. imperialism supports the Belgian colonialists in suppressing the Congolese people's struggle to safeguard national independence, it is intensifying its intervention activities in the Congo under the guise of the United Nations, attempting to take the place of Belgium by seizing the opportunity to infiltrate the Congo on a large scale. The aggression and intervention activities of the imperialists headed by the United States in the Congo have once again exposed the reactionary nature of the colonialists, unmasked the hypocrisy of U.S. imperialism towards the African national independence movement, and made the people of African countries increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of world peace, is also the most ferocious and insidious enemy of the African national independence movement.
    In order to defend national independence, to permanently get rid of the shackles of colonialism, and to oppose the division of the Congo and safeguard Congolese sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Congolese people have launched a heroic armed struggle, giving the Belgian invading troops a heavy blow. The Congolese people are becoming increasingly vigilant about the various interventionist and disruptive activities carried out by U.S. imperialism. The Congolese people's struggle has not only greatly encouraged the national independence movements of the African countries, but also made a major contribution to the cause of opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and defending world peace.
    The patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people is by no means isolated. The fate of the Congolese people is closely linked to the fate of the African people. The people of African countries are joining the Congolese people in opposing imperialist aggression and interference in the Congo. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union firmly supports the just struggle of the Congolese people. The peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world firmly stand on the side of the Congolese people. We, the 650 million Chinese people, have been, are, and will always be the most reliable friends of the Congolese people. We firmly believe that as long as the Congolese people unite as one and wage a persistent struggle, the claws of imperialist aggression and interference in the Congo will be cut off. No force in the world can stop the Congolese people and the African people from embarking on the road to complete independence. Belgian colonialists get out of the Congo! Imperialist aggressive forces headed by the United States get out of the Congo! Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Congolese people!

    首都各界人民支持刚果人民
    反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立大会
    大会通电
    新华社23日讯　首都各界人民支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立大会通电
    我们首都各界人民，今天隆重集会，支援刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立的爱国正义斗争。我们热烈拥护我国政府7月19日发表的关于支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉的声明。我们对刚果人民在斗争中所表现的英雄气概和大无畏精神，表示无限的敬意；对比利时殖民主义者的武装侵略，和以美国为首的帝国主义集团的干涉活动，表示极大的愤怒和强烈的抗议。
    比利时殖民主义者为了保持它在刚果的殖民统治，对新生的刚果共和国进行了一系列的颠复和分裂活动，并且当它的这些活动遭到刚果人民抵抗的时候，就悍然发动了对刚果的武装侵略。比利时殖民主义者的罪恶行为是受到以美国为首的帝国主义的支持和鼓励的。这里特别值得注意的是，美帝国主义一面支持比利时殖民主义者镇压刚果人民维护民族独立的斗争，一面却在联合国的名义下加紧对刚果的干涉活动，企图乘机大举渗入刚果，取比利时的地位而代之。以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果的侵略和干涉活动，再一次暴露了殖民主义者的反动本质，揭穿了美帝国主义对非洲民族独立运动的伪善面目，使非洲各国人民越来越认清，美帝国主义这个世界和平的头号敌人，同时也是非洲民族独立运动最凶恶最阴险的敌人。
    为了保卫民族独立，为了永久摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，为了反对分裂刚果、维护刚果主权和领土完整，刚果人民已经展开了英勇的武装斗争，给比利时侵略军队以沉重的打击。刚果人民正在越来越警惕地注视着美帝国主义所进行的各种干涉和破坏活动。刚果人民的斗争不仅大大地鼓舞了非洲各国人民的民族独立运动，而且对于反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的事业作出了重大的贡献。
    刚果人民的爱国正义斗争决不是孤立的。刚果人民的命运同非洲人民的命运是休戚相关的，非洲各国人民正在同刚果人民一道反对帝国主义对刚果的侵略和干涉。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚决支持刚果人民的正义斗争。全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民坚决站在刚果人民的一边。我们六亿五千万中国人民过去，现在和将来，都始终是刚果人民最可靠的朋友。我们深信，只要刚果人民团结一致，进行坚持不懈的斗争，帝国主义对刚果侵略和干涉的魔爪必将被斩断。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止刚果人民和非洲人民走上彻底独立的道路。比利时殖民主义者从刚果滚出去！以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力从刚果滚出去！最后胜利一定属于英勇的刚果人民！
    首都各界人民支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立大会
