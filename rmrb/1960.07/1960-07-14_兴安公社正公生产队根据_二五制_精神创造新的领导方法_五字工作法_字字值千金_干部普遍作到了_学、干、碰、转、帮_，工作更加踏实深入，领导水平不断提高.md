　　Xing'an Commune Zhengong Production Team Creates New Leadership Method Based on the Spirit of the "Two-Five System"
　　"Five-Character Work Method" - Every Word is Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces
　　Cadres Universally Achieve "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help", Work Becomes More Solid and Thorough, Leadership Level Continuously Improves
Xinhua News Agency report: According to the Hebei Daily news: The Party branch of the Zhengong Production Team of Xing'an Commune in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, in order to effectively improve the style of leadership, promoted the "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help" five-character work method based on the spirit of the "Two-Five System," making the work more meticulous, solid, and thorough, effectively promoting the current production.

    Five-Character Work Method - "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help"

    The specific content of the "Five-Character Work Method" is:

　　"Learn"

　　Production team cadres collectively study for one and a half hours every day. The study time is generally in the morning and can be changed according to the situation of agricultural activities. The arrangement of study content is: three times a week to study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies, twice to study advanced experiences from other places, once to study current events, and once to study agricultural technology.

　　"Do"

　　Thirteen team cadres, except for one person on duty every day to handle routine affairs, all go deep into the fields to work with the commune members, participating in production and leading production. The specific requirements are: 1. Grasp agricultural work, arrange labor, and check attendance; 2. Take the lead in labor, reaching or exceeding the labor level of ordinary commune members; 3. Communicate while working to understand the requirements and opinions of the commune members; 4. Use rest time to organize field reading of newspapers and promote the Party's policies.

　　"Encounter"

　　A team cadre meeting is held every noon for one hour to gather production progress, communicate information, study, and solve problems existing in production; the duty officer explains the received documents and notices from higher authorities and the situations that occur in the village, and jointly discuss and study the measures to be taken.

　　"Rotate"

　　According to the needs of the work tasks, in addition to participating in labor, team cadres should determine certain people and take a certain amount of time to rotate around the plots (generally in the evening) and rotate around the canteens to check the work. The focus of the inspection is: 1. Check the production progress and the completion of major agricultural work as the basis for arranging the next stage of agricultural work; 2. Understand the production situation of the commune members as the material for evaluation; 3. Check the canteen management and hygiene; 4. Contact the small team cadres to determine the time and place for the evening meeting and the issues that need to be studied. The method of rotation is: teams must arrive, plots must be viewed, the overall situation must be observed, and dead corners must be checked, and problems must be solved on the spot. And achieve a combination of rotating points and rotating surfaces, a combination of large and small rotations, a combination of personal and collective rotations (collective rotation once every three days), and a combination of rotating surfaces and evaluation inspections (small team inspections and evaluations are organized after seven days or a period of agricultural work is completed).

　　"Help"

　　Every evening, team cadres go deep into the small teams they are responsible for to provide specific assistance: 1. Study and solve the problems existing in the production and life of the commune members that day; 2. Help arrange agricultural work; 3. Study and summarize advanced experiences; 4. Help hold commune member meetings or organize commune members to conduct political study.

    According to the Zhengong Production Team cadres' experience, the time arrangement and proportion of "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help" should have a certain degree of flexibility in specific implementation. For example, during the rush to cut wheat, team cadres ate and lived in the fields day and night, so they changed to studying once every three or four days and moved the noon meeting to the fields to be held in separate areas. When encountering intensive central work, the time for centralized activities of cadres can also be appropriately expanded, and the time for some decentralized activities can be reduced. However, under normal circumstances, the established system should be strictly implemented and not changed casually.

        How the "Five-Character Work Method" was Produced

    How was the "Five-Character Work Method" proposed? At the beginning of 1960, the Party branch of the Zhengong Production Team studied and promoted advanced experiences from other places. In terms of improving leadership, it adopted the method of planting "experimental fields," with branch committee members dividing battle lines and team cadres dividing responsibilities for each team, which vigorously promoted the leap forward in production. However, this village was originally a third-class team with a poor foundation. Among the thirteen production team cadres, twelve were only appointed after the rectification movement last year. They have the advantages of good composition, high awareness, sufficient enthusiasm, active work, and listening to the Party, but lack practical work experience. At the same time, they did not arrange their study, work, and participation in labor very well. Only two or three cadres went deep into the fields every day, and most people stayed in the village to handle scattered affairs—issuing notes, stamping, holding meetings, statistical reports, etc. Although they worked hard every day, the work always could not keep up. In early April, they saw the Hebei Daily published the leadership experience of Wuqiao County's "Two-Five System," which was greatly inspired. After several studies and discussions, they formulated the three-character work method of "Learn" in the morning, "Do" during the day, and "Meet" (hold meetings) in the evening. After a period of implementation, the work has taken on a new look, but it was found that there were still problems: 1. Cadres go down for a whole day, and the leadership power is no longer flexible; 2. Participating in labor all day long makes it impossible to grasp the overall situation; 3. It is not necessary to hold team cadre meetings every night, and many specific problems existing in production teams need to be solved with the help of brigade cadres. Therefore, it was revised to the five-character work method of "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help." This is a big step forward compared to the "Three-Character Work Method." However, in practice, it was found that the "Rotate" time was too long, affecting participation in production, and at the same time, it fueled the ideas of some cadres who were afraid of hardship and unwilling to participate in labor. After another revision, the "Rotate" time was reduced from half a day to one hour, and the current "Five-Character Work Method" was formally formed. Its characteristics are: the cadre force is concentrated quickly and dispersed quickly, there is up and down, and it is flexible; there is work and rotation in leading production, combining points and surfaces, grasping the situation is both comprehensive and specific, and the command is powerful; "Learn, Do, Encounter, Rotate, Help" are interconnected and mutually restrictive, becoming a relatively complete leadership method, truly reflecting Chairman Mao's teaching of coming from the masses, going to the masses, concentrating, and persisting in the mass line working method.

        The "Five-Character Work Method" Has Six Major Benefits

    Two months of practice have proven that the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method" has the following six major benefits:

    First, the production team cadres devote their main energy to going deep into the front line of production, the work becomes more and more solid and meticulous, and the bottom line becomes clearer and clearer, and a new atmosphere of "four less, four more, and two clear" has emerged. That is: fewer people are busy with affairs in the office, and more people are doing concrete work in the fields and canteens; less of the phenomenon of running around and skimming the surface, and more people are participating in labor, understanding the situation, studying problems, and solving problems; less of pointing fingers and talking empty words, and more of seeking solutions in a practical and realistic manner; more planned discussions and handling of problems, and fewer unprepared meetings; the bottom line of work is clear, and the cadres' minds are clear. Since the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method," the number of team cadres who often go deep into the fields to participate in labor has increased from two or three to ten to twelve.

    Second, the work is planned, meetings are greatly reduced, and the quality is greatly improved. With the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method," the work of the production team has gradually become systematic and standardized, with one link connected to another. Their principle for controlling various meetings is "three nots" (not held without a clear purpose and requirements, not held without mastering sufficient discussion materials, not held if the problem is not important); according to actual needs, it is stipulated that there should be a joint meeting of cadres above the small team leader once every five to seven days, a branch committee meeting once every ten days, an inspection and evaluation meeting every half month, and a branch party member meeting once a month. Except for these, meetings are generally no longer held. In the past, the production team had to call up the small team cadres for every matter, big or small, to arrange meetings; now, to arrange general work, the cadres in charge of the team separately go deep down to convey it. According to statistics, this village held a total of ten various meetings in May, a decrease of twenty-one compared with March before the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method"; in June, five meetings were held, a further decrease of 50% compared with May, and it was achieved that meetings had discussions, resolutions, clear purposes, and prominent centers, overcoming the phenomenon of meeting without deliberation, deliberation without resolution, and staying up half the night whether there was something to do or not.

    Third, cadres participate in labor with a down-to-earth attitude, and the attendance rate of commune members has increased significantly. Since the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method," the enthusiasm and consciousness of production team cadres in participating in labor have been greatly strengthened. From April 10 to June 30, excluding going out to participate in meetings and organizing inspection and evaluation, with an average of seven days occupied by each person, the thirteen team cadres have done a total of eight hundred and eighty-six workdays, accounting for 96% of the actual workdays. Under the active leadership of the production team cadres, among the forty small team cadres, those who did not participate in labor much in the past are now actively going to the fields. This quickly had a good impact on the commune members. The commune members said: "The cadres are working hard from early morning to late night, all for the sake of doing a good job in production, we must work hard." The average attendance rate of the 760 laborers in the village was 76% in May, and it soared to about 98% in June, promoting the leap forward in production.

    Fourth, the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method" has ensured the system for team cadres to study theory and policies, improving their ideological and theoretical level and working ability. Since April, they have adopted the method of "everyone is a student, everyone is a teacher," diligently studying and successively completed the study of fifteen kinds of theoretical works and policy documents such as "On Practice" and "Farmers Learn Philosophy," and actively improved their work based on the principles and spirit they learned. Through study, the enthusiasm of cadres to improve their ideological level, care about the country's political life, and learn from foreign experience has also been further mobilized. Initially, only ten literate cadres participated in the study, but now three illiterate cadres are also actively participating in the study.

    Fifth, the production team cadres do what they say and the vigorous and resolute style has been greatly developed. The production team cadres have established a "three fast" style: fast in implementing the Party's instructions, fast in discovering problems, and fast in solving problems. Basically, they have achieved "discovering problems without delay, solving problems without keeping them overnight." On June 1, after the Party committee put forward the call to arrange the lives of the masses well, everyone did what they said and built a central canteen in three days, which was welcomed by the commune members. In the rush to thresh wheat, the Party branch secretary and the production team leader personally fought hard with the commune members day and night and made a wooden threshing machine, which increased work efficiency by more than three times. Since May, they have timely solved different difficult problems for seventy-three commune members.

    Sixth, it has promoted the backward to catch up with the advanced, and all kinds of work have greatly changed. The focus of the production team cadres' in-depth work is to grasp both ends, one hand grasping the advanced and the other grasping the backward, focusing on the backward teams. After more than two months of work, five of the village's seven third-class teams have risen to second-class teams, and two have leaped into first-class teams. The entire team has changed its backward appearance, and various tasks have also been greatly improved. Li Gouxiang, the political captain of the Fourth Small Team, said: "With the help of the brigade cadres, we have learned many working methods. If we continue to do this, it won't be long before we can win first place in the entire village."

    The "Five-Character Work Method" Greatly Improved the Leadership Style

    The experience of the Zhengong Production Team proves that the implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method" has greatly improved the leadership style and working methods of the production team cadres. The process of implementation is also a process of conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological mobilization and specific organizational work among the cadres. At the beginning, most cadres expressed their support, but some people also had concerns, and there were four fears in their minds: 1. They were afraid that if they participated in too much labor, they would not be able to grasp the overall situation; 2. They were afraid of losing face if they did not do a good job in the small team they were responsible for; 3. They were afraid of doing hard work and could not put down the airs of cadres; 4. They were afraid that they had low literacy and that studying would be difficult, and that it would be a waste of time. Even individual cadres held resistant emotions: they did not participate in study in the morning, did not go to the fields during the day, and used "Rotate" in place of "Do." After discovering these ideological problems, the Party branch talked a lot about the current excellent situation, talked a lot about the necessity of improving leadership methods, and organized all cadres to study again the leadership experience of Wuqiao County's "Two-Five System" and the experience of cadres of the Dongli Village Production Team of this commune in participating in production and leading production; then, with the topic of "How to change the backward appearance? How should we establish a down-to-earth leadership style?" a great debate was held, thereby raising their thinking, unifying their understanding, and strengthening their confidence. The cadres said: "Even the cadres of Wuqiao County who are detached from production can participate in labor, why can't we do it?" The branch seized the model example of branch committee member and production team leader Feng Xiaowa, who could take a certain amount of time every day to study diligently, work with the commune members during the day, and go deep into the small team in the evening to help solve problems, as a pacesetter for implementing the "Five-Character Work Method" and praised him. At the same time, it also formulated the evaluation conditions for "Five-Good" cadres and the study sign-in sheet, work, and labor attendance sheet, registering one day, summarizing and evaluating one month, and announcing the results. In this way, it effectively inspired the cadres' consciousness and enthusiasm for implementing the "Five-Character Work Method." By mid-June, nine of the thirteen team cadres had met the conditions for "Five-Good" cadres. Now, the "Five-Character Work Method" is being implemented more and more smoothly in this production team.

　　兴安公社正公生产队根据“二五制”精神创造新的领导方法
　　“五字工作法”　字字值千金
　　干部普遍作到了“学、干、碰、转、帮”，工作更加踏实深入，领导水平不断提高
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：河北省藁城县兴安公社正公生产队党支部，为切实改进领导作风，根据“二五制”的精神，推行了“学、干、碰、转、帮”五字工作法，使得工作更加细致、踏实和深入，有效地推动了当前生产。
    五字工作法——“学、干、碰、转、帮”
    “五字工作法”的具体内容是：
　　“学”
　　生产队干部每天集体学习一个半小时。学习时间一般是在早晨，根据农事活动的情况可以变动。学习内容的安排是：一周内有三次学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，两次学习外地先进经验，一次学习时事，一次学习农业技术。
　　“干”
　　十三名队干部，每天除留一人值班，处理日常事务，其余都深入田间，和社员一起劳动，参加生产领导生产。具体要求是：一、抓农活、安排劳力，检查出勤情况；二、劳动起带头作用，达到或超过一般社员劳动水平；三、边劳动、边谈心，了解社员的要求和意见；四、利用休息时间，组织地头读报，宣传党的方针政策。
　　“碰”
　　每天中午以一小时的时间召开队干部碰头会，汇集生产进度，沟通情报，研究和解决生产中存在的问题；值班员交代接到的上级文件、通知和村里发生的情况，共同讨论、研究处理的措施。
　　“转”
　　根据工作任务的需要，队干部除参加劳动以外，要确定一定的人，抽一定时间转地块（一般是在傍晚）、转食堂检查工作。检查的重点是：一、查生产进度和主要农活完成情况，作为安排下段农活的根据；二、了解社员生产情况，作为评比的材料；三、查食堂管理和卫生；四、和小队干部联系，确定晚上碰头时间、地点和需要研究的问题。转的方法是：队队到、块块看、大面观、查死角，发现问题就地解决。并做到转点和转面结合，大转与小转结合，个人转与集体转结合（三天集体转一次），转面和评比检查相结合（七天或一段农活完成后组织小队检查评比）。
　　“帮”
　　每天晚上队干部深入到自己所包的小队具体帮助：一、研究和解决当天生产和社员生活中存在的问题；二、帮助安排农活；三、研究总结先进经验；四、帮助开好社员会或组织社员进行政治学习。
    根据正公生产队干部的体会，“学、干、碰、转、帮”的时间安排和比例，在具体执行中，应该有一定的灵活性。如在突击割麦时，队干部日夜吃住在田间，他们就改为每三、四天学习一次，并把中午的碰头会搬到田间分片召开。在遇到突击性的中心工作时，也可以适当地扩大干部集中活动的时间，减少一些分散活动的时间。但是，在一般情况下，应该严格执行既定制度，不随便更改。
        “五字工作法”是怎样产生的
    “五字工作法”是怎样提出的呢？1960年一开始，正公生产队党支部就学习和推广外地先进经验，在改进领导方面，采取了种“试验田”，支部委员分战线，队干部分工包队的方法，有力地推动了生产的跃进。但是，这村原来是一个三类队，基础较差。十三名生产队干部中，有十二名是在去年整风以后才担任工作的。他们具有成份好，觉悟高，干劲足，工作积极，听党的话等优点，但缺乏实际工作经验，同时对学习、工作和参加劳动没有很好地安排，每天仅有二、三名干部深入田间，多数人留在村里处理零星事务——开条、盖戳、开会、统计表报等，虽然每天辛辛苦苦，但工作总赶不上去。4月初，他们看到河北日报发表了吴桥县“二五制”的领导经验，受到很大启示，经过几次学习和酝酿讨论，制定了早上“学”、白天“干”、晚上“会”（开会）的三字工作法。执行一个时期以后，工作有了新的起色，但是发现这样作还是有问题：一、干部一下去就是一天，领导力量调度不灵了；二、整天参加劳动，全面情况没法掌握；三、每天晚上召开队干部会议不太必要，而生产小队存在的许多具体问题，需要大队干部下去帮助解决。于是，又修改为“学、干、碰、转、帮”的五字工作法。这比“三字工作法”前进了一大步。但是在实践中又发现“转”的时间太长，影响参加生产，同时也助长了某些干部的怕艰苦、不愿参加劳动的思想。经过再次修改，把“转”的时间由半天缩减到一个小时，正式形成了现行的“五字工作法”。它的特点就是：干部力量集中快、分散快，有上有下，机动灵活；在领导生产上有干有转，点面结合，掌握情况既全面又具体，指挥有力；“学、干、碰、转、帮”五者互相联系，互相制约，成为一套比较完整的领导方法，真正体现了毛主席教导的从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去的群众路线的工作方法。
        “五字工作法”有六大好处
    两个月来的实践证明，推行“五字工作法”，有以下六大好处：
    第一，生产队干部以主要精力深入生产第一线，工作越来越踏实、细致，底码越来越清楚，出现了“四少、四多、两清楚”的新气象。即：在办公室忙于事务的人少了，在田间、食堂做具体工作的人多了；东跑西转、走马观花的现象少了，参加劳动、了解情况、研究问题、解决问题的人多了；指手划脚说空话的少了，实事求是想办法的多了；有计划地讨论和处理问题多了，无准备的会议减少了；工作底码清楚了，干部头脑清楚了。推行“五字工作法”以来，十三名队干部中，经常深入田间参加劳动的由二、三人增到十至十二人。
    第二，工作有计划，会议大减少，质量大提高。随着“五字工作法”的推行，使生产队工作一环扣一环，逐步走上制度化、正规化。他们对各种会议控制的原则是“三不开”（没有明确的目的要求不开，没掌握足够的讨论材料不开，问题不重要不开）；根据实际需要，规定五至七天一次小队长以上干部联席会，十天一次支委会，半月一次检查评比会和每月召开一次支部党员大会，除此以外，在一般情况下不再召开会议。过去生产队不论大事、小事都要把小队干部调上来，开会布置；现在安排一般工作，则由包队干部分别深入下去，进行传达。据统计，5月份这村共召开各种会议十次，比推行“五字工作法”前的3月份减少了二十一次；6月份召开会议五次，又比5月份减少了50％，并且做到了开会有讨论、有决议、目的明确、中心突出，克服了过去那种会而不议、议而不决，有事没事熬半夜的现象。
    第三，干部脚踏实地参加劳动，社员出勤率显著提高。推行“五字工作法”以来，生产队干部参加劳动的积极性和自觉性大大加强。自4月10日到6月30日，除去外出参加会议，组织检查评比，平均每人占用七天时间以外，十三名队干部共作劳动日八百八十六个，占实有劳动日的96％。在生产队干部的积极带动下，四十名小队干部中，过去参加劳动不多的，现在也积极下地了。这样，很快在社员中发生了良好影响。社员们说：“干部们起早搭黑，都是为了搞好生产，咱们可得使劲干。”全村七百六十个劳动力，5月份平均出勤率为76％，6月份猛增到98％左右，促进了生产的飞跃发展。
    第四，“五字工作法”的推行，使队干部的理论政策学习，有了制度的保证，提高了思想理论水平和工作能力。自4月以来，他们采取了“人人是学生，人人当先生”的办法，刻苦研究，先后学完了“实践论”、“农民学哲学”等十五种理论著作和政策文件，并根据学到的原理和精神积极改进工作。通过学习，也进一步调动了干部要求提高思想水平、关心国家政治生活和学习外地经验的积极性，开始只是十个有文化的干部参加学习，现在三个文盲干部也积极参加学习了。
    第五，生产队干部说干就干，雷厉风行的作风大大发扬。生产队的干部树立了“三快”作风：执行党的指示快、发现问题快、解决问题快。基本上作到了“发现问题不隔晌，解决问题不隔夜。”6月1日，党委提出安排好群众生活的号召后，大家说干就干，三天建成了中心食堂，受到社员的欢迎。在突击打麦中，党支部书记、生产队长亲自和社员一起苦战一昼夜，制成了木制脱粒机，提高工效三倍以上。5月份以来，他们及时给七十三户社员解决了不同的困难问题。
    第六，促使后进赶先进，各种工作大变样。生产队干部深入工作的重点是抓两头，一手抓先进，一手抓后进，重点放在后进队。经过两个多月的工作，全村七个三类小队，已有五个上升为二类队，二个跃进成一类队，全队改变了落后面貌，各项工作也有很大改进和提高。四小队政治队长李狗祥说：“在大队干部的帮助下，我们学会了不少工作方法，照这样干下去，用不了多久我们就能在全村争得第一”。
    “五字工作法”大大改进了领导作风
    正公生产队的经验证明，推行“五字工作法”，大大改进了生产队干部领导作风和工作方法。推行的过程，也是在干部中进行深入细致的思想发动和具体的组织工作过程。一开始，大多数干部表示赞成，有的人也有过顾虑，思想上存有四怕：一、怕参加劳动多了，全面情况没法掌握；二、怕自己包的小队工作搞不好，丢面子；三、怕干累活，放不下干部架子；四、怕自己文化低，学习有困难，白耽误工夫。甚至个别干部抱有抵触情绪：早晨不参加学习，白天不下地，以“转”代“干”。党支部发现这些思想问题后，大讲当前大好形势，大讲改进领导方法的必要性，组织全体干部再次学习吴桥县“二五制”的领导经验和本公社东里村生产队干部参加生产领导生产的经验；接着以“怎样改变落后面貌？应该怎样树立踏踏实实的领导作风？”为题，进行大辩论，从而提高了思想，统一了认识，坚定了信心。干部们说：“人家吴桥县脱产干部都能参加劳动，为什么咱们不能作到呢？”支部抓住了支部委员、生产队长冯小娃每天能抽一定时间刻苦学习，白天和社员一起干活，晚上深入到小队具体帮助解决问题的模范事例，作为执行“五字工作法”的标兵，予以表扬。同时，还制定了“五好”干部评比条件和学习签到表、工作、劳动考勤表，一天一登记，每月一总结评比，公布成绩。这样一来，有效地启发了干部执行“五字工作法”的自觉性、积极性。到6月中旬，十三名队干部中已有九名达到“五好”干部条件。现在，“五字工作法”在这个生产队推行得越来越顺利。
