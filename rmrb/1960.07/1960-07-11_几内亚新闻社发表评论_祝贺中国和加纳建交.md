Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, July 8th: The Guinea News Agency published a commentary today congratulating China and Ghana on the establishment of diplomatic relations.

The commentary stated that following Guinea, the Republic of Ghana has established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China at the ambassadorial level. This event should be given due importance because, in accordance with the policy direction of independent African countries to establish cooperative relations with the people of all countries in the world, it is first necessary to establish friendly relations with the people of Asian countries, and especially to establish friendly relations between the great Chinese people and the people of African countries.

The commentary said that, as the "People's Daily" in Beijing said in its editorial on July 6, the African people are fully capable of recognizing friends and enemies from their own experiences.

The commentary also believes that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese people and the African people have entered a new era.

　　祝贺中国和加纳建交
    新华社科纳克里8日电　几内亚新闻社今天发表评论，祝贺中国和加纳建立外交关系。
    评论说，继几内亚之后，加纳共和国同中华人民共和国建立大使级外交关系。这件事应该受到人们予以应有的重视，因为依据非洲独立国家主张同世界各国人民建立合作关系的政策方针，首先必须同亚洲各国人民建立友好关系，尤其应该在伟大的中国人民和非洲各国人民之间建立友好关系。
    评论说，正如7月6日北京“人民日报”在它的社论中所说的，非洲人民从他们的亲身经历中是完全能够认清敌友的。
    评论也认为，中国人民和非洲人民的友好合作关系进入了一个新纪元。
