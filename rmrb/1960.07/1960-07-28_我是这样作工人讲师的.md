I am Duan Guangrui, a young worker and freight car inspector at the Shijiazhuang Railway Vehicle Depot, and a worker lecturer since 1958 when I began studying Chairman Mao's works. In 1960, I was hired as a worker lecturer.

At that time, I felt both happy and timid. I was happy because the Party had given me an extremely glorious task, but I was timid because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to lecture well. Just as I was hesitating, the Party committee convened a worker lecturer oath-taking and skills competition meeting. The Party committee secretary gave us a report at the meeting. He said, "No matter what you do, you must have ambition and courage." He also told us, "If you want to be a good teacher, you must first be a good student." This gave me great inspiration and encouragement, and I resolved to complete the task assigned to me by the Party.

The first time I lectured on the two worldviews, I didn't know how to connect theory with practice, and I was afraid of saying something wrong, so I copied from the book and read it verbatim. After lecturing for an hour, I was sweating profusely, and everyone was falling asleep. Afterwards, I solicited everyone's opinions, and some people said, "We don't understand what 'metaphysics' is or what 'the universe' is." Based on these opinions, I changed my lecture method, but I went to another extreme, discussing things in isolation. When I lectured on "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I only told everyone a story and related some practical examples from the depot, without talking about Chairman Mao's revolutionary determination under the conditions at the time to remove the "two big mountains" weighing on the Chinese people, and how to strengthen the confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolution. The workers reflected that "the things you talk about are quite vivid, it's like a storytelling session, not a theory class." Through these two lectures, I realized that connecting theory with practice means having both theory and practice; empty talk about theory and discussing things in isolation are both unacceptable. At this time, the Party committee encouraged my spirit of daring to speak and pointed out that the root cause of these two situations was insufficient study and a lack of deep understanding of Mao Zedong Thought; they encouraged me not to "retreat" but to study hard, learning while doing and doing while learning. In order to improve the quality of my lectures, I studied the three articles "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," "Reform Our Study," and "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," which made me more clear about the importance of connecting theory with practice. Theory must serve the struggle for production and the political struggle; otherwise, it loses the meaning of studying theory. To achieve this, one must first study well; only by studying well can one use it well and lecture well.

Chairman Mao instructed us that if we want to be a good teacher, we must first be a good student. This is a truth. In addition to actively participating in collective learning, I also made a self-study plan. I insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works for two to three hours every day, systematically studying two sections (or two chapters) every week, and writing an article or lecture draft based on the content of the study and the production situation. I adopted a seven-character formula in my study: "Squeeze," squeeze time. Carry books with you, study before meals, before meetings, and before going to bed, half an hour every morning, to accumulate bits and pieces into a whole and accumulate little into much; "Read," read Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies. Read carefully, concentrate, and read repeatedly; "Delve," study diligently. Ponder word by word, sentence by sentence, line by line, and paragraph by paragraph to understand the essence; "Ask," ask for advice. Take the able as teachers, teach and learn from each other; "Record," take good study notes. Write down心得 (xinde - insights) after studying a section; "Debate," raise questions to the theory research group or find workers to debate; "Persevere," learning must be persevering. Currently, I have studied to the second volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong; repeatedly studied "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and studied 15 reference books such as "Practice is the Unity of the Opposition Between the Subjective and the Objective." With this "capital," I used the theory I learned to analyze production and analyze thinking, and the lecture drafts I compiled were more closely integrated with theory and practice, the viewpoints were clearer, the content was richer, and the combat effectiveness and ideology were stronger. The masses reflected after listening to the lectures that "it solves problems."

Preparation is very important. If the lesson is well prepared, it can be taught well. I adopted four methods when preparing lessons: (1) Read books with problems in mind. To lecture on a certain problem, first focus on reading the relevant parts of Chairman Mao's works and studying the Party's relevant policies, then find reference books and write an outline; (2) Conduct in-depth and meticulous investigation. Conduct special investigations and research to ensure that the arrow of theory hits the target of practice. Focus on specific examples of production keys and ideological trends to enrich the content of the lecture; (3) Collective discussion and finalization. Submit the first draft I wrote to the theory research group and invite veteran workers and advanced producers to study and discuss it, and further supplement and modify it; (4) Participate in discussions. After the lecture, go into groups to participate in discussions, listen to everyone's opinions on the lecture, and do some small tutoring on the questions raised in the discussion.

When lecturing, I also paid attention to talking about things that workers care about, speaking the language of workers, and thoroughly implementing Mao Zedong Thought. For example, when lecturing on the two worldviews, I focused on grasping the relationship between internal and external causes. In response to the one-sided view of some workers in our section that "advancement is entirely cultivated by the leadership," I made a clear comparison using the typical deeds of advanced producers and veteran workers Kang Genhuai and Chen Xiaofu and some backward workers. It explains that internal cause is the basis and external cause is the condition, and argues that giving play to subjective initiative is the determining factor in the speed of progress. Worker Tian Shuheng said, "This lecture cleared up my years of wrong thinking."

When lecturing to outside units, I first asked their leaders for instructions, found out the details, understood the nature of the business and the audience, and lectured in conjunction with typical examples they were familiar with. The People's Hospital is full of intellectuals, so I took the red doctor Wu Dianhua as an example and highlighted the importance of transforming thinking and connecting theory with practice.

Since I started lecturing, I have realized that only by listening to the Party's words, acting in accordance with the Party's instructions, constantly strengthening my own learning, listening to everyone's opinions, and humbly learning from the masses can I be a good worker lecturer and constantly improve myself in lecturing.

    我是这样作工人讲师的
    石家庄车辆段检车员、工人讲师　段光瑞
    我是石家庄车辆段中列检的青年工人，自1958年开始学习毛主席著作。1960年我被聘为工人讲师。
    当时，我心中又高兴又胆怯。高兴的是党给自己一个极其光荣的任务，胆怯的是怕讲不了。我正在犹豫不决的时候，党委召开了工人讲师誓师比武大会，党委书记在大会上给我们做了报告。他说：“无论干什么事，都要有志气，有勇气。”并告诉我们：“要想当好先生，首先要当好学生。”这给了我很大的启发和鼓舞，下决心要完成党所交给的任务。
    在第一次讲两种宇宙观的时候，不知道理论如何联系实际，又怕讲错了，就从书上抄，照本念。讲了一小时，急了一头汗，还把大家都讲得睡着了。以后我征求大家的意见，有人说：“我们听不懂什么叫‘形而上学’，什么叫‘宇宙’。”根据这些意见，我就改变了讲课方法，可又走向了另一个极端，就事论事。我在讲《愚公移山》这一课的时候，只是给大家讲了一段故事，联系了一些段上的实际事例，而没有讲毛主席在当时的条件下，决心搬走压在中国人民头上的“两座大山”的革命毅力、如何坚定革命必胜的信心。职工们反映说：“讲的事到挺生动，是个故事会，不像理论课。”通过这两次的讲课实践，使我认识到理论联系实际，是既要有理论又要有实际，空谈理论和就事论事都不行。这时，党委鼓励了我敢讲的精神，同时指出产生这两种情况的根源在于学习不够，领会毛泽东思想不够深刻；勉励我不要“打退堂鼓”，要很好地学习，在干中学，学中干。为了提高讲课质量，我学习了《反对党八股》、《改造我们的学习》和《整顿党的作风》三篇文章，使我更加明确了理论联系实际的重要性，理论必须为生产斗争、政治斗争服务，否则就失去了学理论的意义。要做到这一点，首先应该学习好；只有学习好，才能用好，讲好。
    毛主席指示我们要想当好先生，首先要当好学生，这是千真万确的真理。我除了积极参加集体学习以外，还订了自学规划。每天坚持学习毛主席著作二至三小时，每周系统学习两节（或两章），根据学习的内容和生产情况，写出一篇文章或讲稿。我在学习中采用了七字经：就是“挤”，挤时间。书本随手带，饭前、会前、睡前学，每天早上半小时，做到集零为整，积少成多；“读”，阅读毛主席著作、党的方针政策。认真地读，聚精会神地读，反复地读；“钻”，刻苦钻研。逐字、逐句、逐行、逐段地捉摸，领会精神实质；“请”，登门请教。拜能者为师，互教互学；“记”，作好学习笔记。学了一段写出心得；“辩”，有问题提到理论研究组或找职工进行辩论；“恒”，学习必须有恒心。目前我已经学到毛泽东选集第二卷；反复地学习了《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，并学习了《实践是主客观对立的统一》等十五种参考书籍。有了“本钱”，用学到的理论去分析生产、分析思想，编出的讲稿，理论与实际结合的就紧密了，观点鲜明了，内容丰富了，战斗性思想性也强了。群众听了课反映说：“解决问题。”
    备课很重要。课备得好，才能讲得好。我在备课的时候，采取了四个办法：（一）针对问题读书，要想讲什么问题，首先重点地读毛主席著作中的有关部分和学习党的有关方针政策，再找参考书，写出提纲；（二）深入细致地摸情况。做专题的调查研究，使理论之矢射实际之的。重点摸生产关键和思想倾向中的具体事例，充实讲课内容；（三）集体讨论定稿。把自己写出的初稿，提交理论研究组和请老工人、先进生产者研究讨论，进一步补充和修改；（四）参加讨论。讲课以后深入小组参加讨论，听取大家对讲课的意见，并对于讨论中提出的问题，做些小辅导。
    讲课时还注意了讲工人关心的事，说工人的话，深刻地贯彻毛泽东思想。如在讲两种宇宙观的时候，我就着重地抓住了内因外因的关系，针对我段有的职工认为“先进完全是领导培养起来的”的片面认识，就以先进生产者、老师傅康根怀和陈小福的典型事迹和某些落后的工人作了显明的对比。说明了内因是根据，外因是条件，论述了发挥主观能动性，是进步快慢的决定因素。工人田书恒说：“这一讲把我多年的错误思想打通了。”
    给外单位讲课的时候，我就事先请示了他们领导，摸清底细，了解了业务性质和听课的对象，结合他们熟悉的典型事例讲课。人民医院都是知识分子，我就以红色医生吴殿华为例，突出地讲改造思想和理论联系实际的重要性。
    自讲课以来，我体会到，只有听党的话，按党的指示办事，不断加强自己的学习，听取大家的意见，虚心向群众学习，才能当好工人讲师，并在讲课中不断提高自己。
