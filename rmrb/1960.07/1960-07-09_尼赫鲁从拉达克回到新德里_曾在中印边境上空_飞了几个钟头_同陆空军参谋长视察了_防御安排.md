Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, New Delhi Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru returned to New Delhi today after spending five days in Kashmir.

According to the Press Trust of India, during his stay in Kashmir, Nehru, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff Thimayya and Air Force Chief of Staff Mujik, visited Indian military outposts in Ladakh such as Leh and Chushul. On the 5th, Nehru also flew for "several hours" over the border between Chinese Tibet and Ladakh.

Prior to this, on the 4th, while addressing the militia in Leh, Nehru also talked to them about "the need to be prepared to deal with all dangers."

According to reports, Nehru discussed "defense" issues with the chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force and local commanders in Chushul and inspected the so-called "defense arrangements."

In a speech delivered in Srinagar, Kashmir, on the 6th after returning from Chushul, Nehru said that the main purpose of his visit to Kashmir was to "visit" Ladakh. He said that although it was inappropriate for him to discuss what "defense arrangements" had been completed, he was convinced that adequate "security measures have been taken to defend the border."

Nehru once again attacked China, saying that "in the past year or so, we (India) have been attacked in that region," and that "some territories in Ladakh are under foreign occupation."

    尼赫鲁从拉达克回到新德里
    曾在中印边境上空“飞了几个钟头”
    同陆空军参谋长视察了“防御安排”
    新华社7日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在克什米尔逗留了五天以后，今天回到新德里。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在克什米尔逗留期间，尼赫鲁由陆军参谋长蒂迈雅和空军参谋长慕吉克陪同，曾去拉达克的列城和楚舒勒等地的印军前哨地点活动。5日尼赫鲁还曾坐飞机在中国西藏和拉达克的边境的上空“飞了几个钟头”。
    在这以前，尼赫鲁4日在列城向民兵部队讲话时，也向他们谈论什么“必须准备好对付一切危险”。
    据报道，尼赫鲁在楚舒勒曾同陆、空两军参谋长和当地指挥官讨论了“防务”问题，并且视察了所谓“防御安排”。
    尼赫鲁在6日回到克什米尔的斯利那加后发表的讲话中说，他访问克什米尔的主要目的在于“访问”拉达克。他说，虽然要他谈已经完成了什么“防御安排”是不适当的，但是他深信已经采取了充分的“安全措施来保卫边境”。
    尼赫鲁再次攻击中国，说什么“在去年或多一点的时间中，我们（印度）在那个地区遭到了攻击”，“拉达克的有些领土是在外国的占领之下”。
