	Sending Manpower, Materials, and Technology to Communes
	Higher Education Institutions Nationwide Fully Support Agriculture

	According to Xinhua News Agency, faculty and students from higher education institutions across the country are providing comprehensive support to rural people's communes in various aspects, including science and technology, culture and education, medical and health care, as well as manpower and materials.

	To better support agriculture, higher education institutions in various regions have generally established ties with people's communes in counties and suburban areas near the schools, fixing their support targets. Tsinghua University, Peking University, and other technical universities and universities with science departments in Beijing have established fixed cooperative relationships with eight rural people's communes in Yongfeng, Haidian, and Si Jiqing in the suburbs of Beijing. Each school has sent responsible cadres and work teams to visit the communes, understand their needs, and make specific arrangements for the work. Many higher education institutions in Jiangsu Province have established special institutions to support agriculture, sending personnel to the linked communes for contact and investigation, and actively inviting county and commune Party secretaries to the schools to introduce the situation and arrange relevant matters of cooperation and support. In the Hefei area of Anhui Province, higher education institutions are linked with communes, and Anhui Agricultural University alone has established regular contact systems with 40 communes and state-owned farms. Through linking with communes and establishing contact and cooperation, schools in various regions have understood the urgent needs of agricultural production and, based on the requirements of the technical revolution, have generally formulated long-term or short-term plans to support agriculture. Many schools have 90% of their faculty and students participating in activities to support agriculture.

	Helping rural people's communes carry out agricultural technical transformation and rapidly increase agricultural output is one of the main contents of higher education institutions' support for agriculture. More than 600 faculty and students from the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization have participated in agricultural mechanization pilot projects. According to incomplete statistics, they have successfully designed more than 180 types of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools. Faculty and students from the Nanjing Institute of Technology have listed the construction plans of rural people's communes and agricultural machinery technology as the main research projects of related majors. In the first quarter of this year, they designed 23 workshops for large-scale agricultural machinery plants, one tractor factory, designed or manufactured more than 40 new types of deep plowing combined harvesters, tractors, and other mechanized farm tools, and three automatic production lines for agricultural machinery. They also helped communes solve more than 100 technical key problems in agricultural machinery production. Nanjing Agricultural College assisted the Changjiang and Jiangdong People's Communes in formulating agricultural mechanization plans and accepted the task of manufacturing 550 threshers for Nanjing City. The Nanjing Agricultural No. 2 Rice Transplanter, which they successfully trial-produced, is also being promoted in various communes. Twenty-one higher education institutions in the Jinan area of Shandong Province have also organized thousands of people to help solve technical problems in surveying, design, construction, and tool reform in reservoir projects, hydropower stations, sluice dams, and irrigation canals, powerfully supporting the construction of rural people's communes' hydropower projects.

	Since 1958, agricultural colleges and universities in various regions have been vigorously supporting the movement for bumper harvests of agricultural crops in terms of science and technology. Since the beginning of this year, in response to the Party committee's call to support agriculture, various schools have rearranged their teaching and scientific research work to serve agricultural production more closely. For example, nearly all of the 79 scientific research topics and 338 sub-topics conducted by Northwest Agricultural College this semester are urgently needed to solve the practical problems of current agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. More than 200 faculty and students from Beijing Agricultural University, assigned to Daxing County, under the leadership of the county Party committee, took on the technical work of the high-yield demonstration fields and, together with the peasants, experimented with transforming 200,000 mu of saline-alkali land into paddy fields. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1960, 95 fourth-year students and four teachers from the Department of Plant Protection of Shenyang Agricultural College went to the communes in early April to help prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, they widely mobilized the masses and actively adopted effective measures, launching a massive mass movement to eliminate pests and treat diseases. In Tai'an County alone, more than 580,000 corn borer larvae were captured in half a month. During their internship, fourth-year students from the Agronomy Department of Sichuan Agricultural College conducted a large-scale survey of high-yield experiences centered on wheat and rapeseed, vigorously assisting the communes in studying and solving the problem of eliminating third-class wheat seedlings, and promoting local agricultural production. Agricultural colleges and universities in various regions have also supported agricultural production with materials, such as supplying pesticides and improved varieties.

	In the activities to support agriculture, higher education institutions in various regions also used various methods to train technical personnel for the communes. Anhui Agricultural College has successively held 29 training courses in early rice seedling cultivation, cotton cultivation, etc., training a total of more than 5,340 technical personnel of various types for the communes in the past six months. Since January of this year, Nanjing Agricultural College has conducted various training courses both on and off campus, training more than 3,000 technicians for people's communes in pig farming, veterinary medicine, plant protection, rice transplanter manufacturing and use, as well as tractor and combine drivers. Faculty and students from the Beijing Mining Institute participating in agricultural technical transformation in Changping County trained 66 technical workers of various types and more than 200 locomotive stoker operators for the communes in two months. In addition to organizing mobile medical services and helping communes set up hospitals, faculty and students from medical colleges and universities in various regions also helped communes train medical and health personnel. Medical colleges and universities in Shandong Province alone trained as many as 120,000 midwives, health workers, and nursery workers for rural people's communes.

	In addition, higher education institutions in various regions also promptly organized manpower to support drought resistance, summer harvesting and planting, or water conservancy construction according to the needs of agricultural production. For example, all faculty and students of the East China Institute of Water Conservancy supported water conservancy construction in the past five months this year, participating in more than 70,000 workdays of water conservancy engineering surveying, design, and construction. Many schools also helped communes run spare-time schools or help establish libraries to expand the rural base for political, cultural, and technical learning. (Attached picture)

    把人力、物力、技术送到公社去
    各地高等院校全面支援农业
    据新华社讯  全国各地高等院校师生从科学技术、文化教育、医药卫生以及人力、物力等各方面，给予农村人民公社全面的支援。
    各地高等院校为更好地支援农业，普遍与学校所在地区附近的县、郊区人民公社挂了钩，固定支援对象。北京清华大学、北京大学等十所工科和设有理科的高等院校，分别和北京郊区永丰、海淀、四季青等八个农村人民公社建立了固定的协作关系，各校都派出负责干部和工作组访问了公社，了解公社的需要，对工作做出了具体安排。江苏省许多高等院校专门成立了支援农业的机构，派人到挂钩的公社去联系和调查，主动邀请县和公社的党委书记到学校介绍情况，安排了有关协作支援事项。安徽省合肥地区各高等院校与公社挂钩，仅安徽农业大学就分别同四十个公社、国营农场建立了经常的联系制度。各地学校通过与公社挂钩，建立联系和协作关系，了解了农业生产的缓急需要，根据技术革命的要求，普遍制定了支援农业的长期规划或短期计划。许多学校90％的师生都参加了支援农业的活动。
    帮助农村人民公社进行农业技术改造，迅速提高农业产量，是各地高等学校支援农业的主要内容之一。北京农业机械化学院六百多名师生参加了农业机械化试点工作，据不完全统计，已设计成功一百八十多种机械化、半机械化农具。南京工学院师生把农村人民公社的建设规划和农业机械技术，列为有关专业的主要研究项目，今年第一季度中，他们设计出大型农业机械厂的车间二十三个，拖拉机厂一座，设计或已制成新型深耕联合收割机、拖拉机和其它机械化农具四十多种，农机具生产自动线三条，还帮助公社解决农业机械生产中的技术关键一百多项。南京农学院协助长江、江东人民公社制定了农业机械化规划，并接受了南京市五百五十台脱谷机制造任务。他们试制成功的南农二号插秧机也正在各公社推广使用。山东济南地区的二十一所高等院校，还先后组织了数千人到水利工地帮助解决了水库工程、水电站、闸坝、灌溉渠道等方面的测量、设计、施工、工具改革等技术问题，有力地支援了农村人民公社水电建设事业。
    各地农业院校从1958年以来，一直从科学技术方面大力支援农作物丰产运动。今年以来，各校响应党委关于支援农业的号召，又重新安排了教学和科学研究工作，更密切地为农业生产服务。如西北农学院这学期来所进行的七十九项、三百三十八个科学研究题目，几乎全部都是当前农、林、牧业生产实际所急需解决的问题。北京农业大学下放大兴县的二百多名师生，在县委领导下，担任了丰产指挥田的技术工作，并和农民一道试验将二十万亩盐碱地改良为水稻田。为了争取1960年农业大丰收，沈阳农学院植物保护系四年级的九十五名学生和教师四人，于4月初分赴公社帮助防治作物病虫害，他们在当地党委领导下，广泛发动群众，积极采取有效措施，掀起了一个声势浩大的群众性灭虫治病运动，仅台安一县半月内就捉了玉米螟幼虫五十八万多只。四川农学院农学系四年级学生在实习期间，开展了以小麦、油菜为中心的大面积丰产经验调查，大力协助公社研究解决消灭小麦三类苗的问题，促进了当地农业生产。各地农业院校还从物力方面——如供应农药和优良品种等，支援了农业生产。
    在支援农业的活动中，各地高等院校还用各种办法为公社培养技术人材。安徽农学院曾连续举办了早稻育秧、棉花栽培等二十九个训练班，半年来共计为公社培训了各种技术人材五千三百四十多人。今年1月以来，南京农学院在校内外开办的各种训练班，为人民公社培训了养猪、兽医、植物保护、插秧机制造和使用、以及拖拉机和康拜因手等技术人员三千多人。北京矿业学院在昌平县参加农业技术改造的师生，在两个月的时间内，就为公社培训了各工种的技术工人六十六名，锅驼机手二百多名。各地医药院校师生除组织巡回医疗，帮助公社开办医院外，也都帮助公社培训医药卫生人员，仅山东省医药院校即为农村人民公社培训助产员、卫生员、保育员等十二万人之多。
    此外，各地高等院校还根据农业生产需要，及时组织人力支援抗旱、夏收夏种或水利施工。如华东水利学院全体师生，在今年以来的五个月中，支援水利建设，参加水利工程勘测、设计、施工七万多个劳动日。许多学校还帮助公社举办业余学校，或帮助建立图书馆，扩大农村政治、文化、技术学习的阵地。（附图片）
