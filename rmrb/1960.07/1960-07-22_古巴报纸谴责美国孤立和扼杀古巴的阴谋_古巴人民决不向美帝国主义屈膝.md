Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 21st: Cuban newspapers are angrily condemning the US's intensified conspiracy to aggress against Cuba.

    A commentary published in "Hoy" today pointed out that the US is attempting to use the two historical corpses of the Monroe Doctrine and the Marshall Plan to isolate Cuba and strangle the Cuban Revolution. The commentary said that the anti-Cuba conspiracy plotted by Washington is an attempt to deceive and attack all independent and democratic movements. When a certain Latin American country obstructs the US monopoly groups, the US trots out the old, crudely manufactured excuse of so-called "international communism." The newspaper emphasized that 1960 is neither 1823 (when the US announced the Monroe Doctrine) nor 1954. In 1954, the US used the Monroe Doctrine to strangle the democratic government of Guatemala. Today, Cuba and Latin America will not be deceived and will not yield.

    An editorial in "Revolución" pointed out that the US oligarchs are concentrating their economic power to exert pressure on some Latin American countries in an attempt to achieve their goal of taking collective action against Cuba.

    A commentary in "Combate" stated, when talking about the recent anti-Cuba conspiracies carried out by the US in the Organization of American States and the United Nations Security Council, that Cuba is fully aware that in the Organization of American States and in the United Nations, the US representatives are doing one thing, and that is to carry out collective retaliatory activities against Cuba as much as possible. However, Cuba, having suffered the massacre of US-made bombs, machine guns, and tanks during the Batista tyranny, no longer fears.

    "Sierra Maestra" also published a commentary condemning the US for pursuing its traditional policy of control and bribery in the United Nations and the Organization of American States.

    "Adelante" said that the Cuban people, who will neither betray nor surrender, will know how to resist and achieve victory. The newspaper emphasized that Cuba has the support of the people of the world and the people who are determined to strive to hold their heads up and live facing the sun.

    古巴报纸谴责美国孤立和扼杀古巴的阴谋
    古巴人民决不向美帝国主义屈膝
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴报纸愤怒谴责美国加紧侵略古巴的阴谋。
    “今日报”今天发表的评论指出，美国企图利用门罗主义和马歇尔计划这两具历史僵尸来孤立古巴和扼杀古巴革命。评论说，华盛顿策划的反对古巴的阴谋就是企图用来欺骗和打击一切独立和民主运动的阴谋。在某个拉丁美洲国家妨碍了美国垄断集团的时候，美国就搬出所谓“国际共产主义”这个老一套的粗制滥造的借口。报纸强调指出，但是1960年既不是（美国宣布门罗主义的）1823年，也不是1954年了。在1954年美国利用门罗主义扼杀了危地马拉的民主政府。今天，古巴和拉丁美洲不会受骗和屈膝。
    “街道报”发表的社论指出，美国寡头正集中它的经济力量向某些拉丁美洲国家施加压力，企图达到它采取反对古巴的集体行动的目的。
    “战斗报”的评论在谈到美国最近在美洲国家组织和联合国安全理事会进行的反古巴阴谋时指出，古巴完全知道，在美洲国家组织和联合国一样，美国代表所作的是一回事，那就是尽可能对古巴进行集体报复活动。但是，古巴在经受过巴蒂斯塔暴政时期的美制炸弹、机枪及坦克的屠杀以后，它已经不再畏惧了。
    “马埃斯特腊山日报”也发表评论，谴责美国在联合国和美洲国家组织中奉行传统的控制和收买政策。
    “前进报”说，不叛卖也不投降的古巴人民将知道进行抵抗和取得胜利。报纸强调指出，古巴有世界人民的支持以及决心争取抬起头来面向太阳生活的人民。
