    New Developments in "408" Automatic Transportation Line
    Can Cross Small Hills to Transport Coal from Inside the Mine to the Coke Oven
    (Our Dispatch) The workers of the Huangnitang Coal Mine in Qiyang County, Hunan Province, learned from the experience of the 408-type automatic transportation line of the Shizitang Coal Mine (see page 4 of this newspaper on July 22) and creatively developed it. Not long ago, they created a double-track, unmanned, and mechanism-free automatic loading and unloading transportation line that is 115 meters long. It can transport 395 tons of coal in eight hours, saving 463 transport laborers, and improving work efficiency by 197 times compared to manual labor.
    The characteristic of this new type of automatic transportation line is that it can transport coal from inside the mine, cross a small hill, and directly deliver it to the coke oven. The round trip is completely automatic, without a single person loading or unloading. The materials used for manufacturing are all iron, wood, and bamboo. The workers sing:
    The mountain is high, the pass is narrow, the path is winding, carrying it on our shoulders is really difficult.
    Since we have the automatic line, it runs like flying over mountains and valleys.
    Technical innovation is really exciting, unmanned and mechanism-free, with high work efficiency.

    “四○八”自动运输线有新发展
    能翻过小山把煤从井内运到炼焦炉边
    本报讯　湖南省祁阳县黄泥塘煤矿的职工学习石梓塘煤矿408型自动运输线的经验（见7月22日本报第四版），又创造性地加以发展，不久以前制成了一条长达一百一十五米的双轨无人无机的自动装卸运输线。八小时内可运煤三百九十五吨，节省运输劳力四百六十三人，较人工提高工效一百九十七倍。
    这条新型自动运输线的特点是，能够将煤从井内运出，翻过一座小山，直接送到炼焦炉边，来回完全自动，不要一人装卸。制造的材料都是铁、木、竹材。工人们歌唱道：
    山高坳狭羊肠道，肩挑背负实难熬。
    自从有了自动线，翻山越岭如飞跑。
    技术革新真带劲，无人无机工效高。
