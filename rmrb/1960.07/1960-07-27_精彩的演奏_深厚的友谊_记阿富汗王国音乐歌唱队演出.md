Wonderful Performance, Deep Friendship
    ——On the Performance of the Music and Song Troupe of the Kingdom of Afghanistan
    Wang Xin
    The Music and Song Troupe of the Kingdom of Afghanistan is the first visiting art troupe from our neighbor, the Kingdom of Afghanistan, from beyond the Pamir Plateau. People appreciated the artists' wonderful and beautiful performances with joy and delight. The performance began with a full ensemble of the national instrumental band playing "Fallen Flowers"; the band consisted of Afghan national musical instruments, a trumpet, a mandolin, and a sitting accordion. The Kingdom of Afghanistan is a country with a long and ancient culture, and the ancient national musical instruments played by the artists are rarely seen by us. For example, the Sorinda is a three-stringed bowed instrument with a peculiar shape, somewhat like an old violin, but with a resonance board made of animal skin and many small resonating strings on the side. When played with a bow, the sound is very melodious and pleasant. Another example is a larger, mid-range plucked instrument called the Rubab, which is somewhat like the Xinjiang Uyghur national instrument, the Rawap, with four strings. When played, the sound is sonorous and pleasant. These instruments not only have their ancient and unique forms and playing methods, but also their unique sound. Combined with the artists' touching singing full of national characteristics, it seemed to transport us to the Afghan plateau surrounded by mountains, listening to the simple and honest Afghan farmers singing ancient folk songs. The Afghan people are very fond of singing, and they often gather at home to sing all night long on festive days or holidays, singing those long and large-scale narrative songs full of poetry. The singing by singers such as Mr. Hayal, Ms. Najin, and Mr. Dul each had their own characteristics. For example, the two love songs composed by Mr. Bureshina and sung by Mr. Hayal were expressed delicately and deeply. Several Pashto folk songs sung by singers Ms. Najin and Mr. Hatam appeared lively and full of vigor, which is related to the brave and strong character of the Pashtun people. The Chinese songs sung by the singers received a particularly warm welcome from the audience. The audience listened with amazement to the Chinese song "Xinjiang is Good" sung by the singer. It is rare that he sang so well, which shows the deep friendship between the Chinese and Afghan people.
    The audience was particularly interested in the Afghan drum solo. This drum is very much like an ancient Chinese porcelain vase, made of a ceramic bottle with a sheepskin drumhead, and the bottle is inlaid with exquisite golden patterns. The drum is held in the arms and played with both hands. The hands of the performer, Mr. Mulang Nevawi, sometimes slowly and rhythmically beat the drum, playing lyrical slow techniques, and sometimes speeded across the drum, playing a rapid and stormy rhythm. The performer used skillful strikes with both hands, striking the center and edges of the drum, to produce ever-changing timbres and rhythms. The audience enthusiastically requested an encore. It is worth mentioning that two Western musical instruments, the trumpet and the mandolin, were also added to the national orchestra, and they were also played extremely well, without feeling uncoordinated, because the playing methods of the trumpet and the mandolin were also nationalized, which is very interesting. The performance of the Music and Song Troupe of the Kingdom of Afghanistan in Beijing was a success and was warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience.
    The performance of the Music and Song Troupe of the Kingdom of Afghanistan in Beijing this time made me feel particularly cordial, because in the summer of 1958, I went to the Kingdom of Afghanistan with the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Independence Day, visited the two cities of Kabul and Kandahar, and performed for nearly a month. We were warmly and friendly received and welcomed by the Kingdom's government and people everywhere. In particular, we were invited to participate in the grand military parade observation ceremony for Independence Day. We saw the glorious artillery with which the heroic Afghan soldiers and civilians defeated British imperialist aggression forty years ago, and learned about several heroic anti-imperialist struggles in the history of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, which made us feel awe-inspired. When we held a plaza performance for 30,000 spectators participating in the national festival at Kabul Stadium, the broad masses of the Afghan people developed a strong interest in Chinese song and dance art. After the performance, they were still reluctant to leave and thanked the actors one after another. When we held special performances for women in women's schools and women's associations in Kabul and Kandahar, Afghan women took off their veils and received us with the etiquette of relatives, leaving us with a deep impression. We also held cordial talks with musicians from Kabul Radio, introduced each other's musical development, and exchanged musical materials. All of these things promoted cultural exchanges between the two countries and learned many good and beneficial things from each other. What we especially remember is that the King of the Kingdom of Afghanistan personally received the leaders of the art troupe, and Prime Minister Daoud personally went on stage to present flowers to the actors, which symbolized the deep friendship between the two countries. This time, the Music and Song Troupe of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has come to our country for a visit and performance for the first time. I believe that through this successful visit and performance, the close friendship between the people and artists of our two countries, China and Afghanistan, will be further enhanced. I wish the artists greater success in their performances in other cities in our country!

    精彩的演奏  深厚的友谊
    ——记阿富汗王国音乐歌唱队演出
    王莘
    阿富汗王国音乐歌唱队，是第一个来自帕米尔高原那边的我们的邻国——阿富汗王国的访华艺术团。人们怀着欢欣愉快的心情，欣赏了艺术家们精彩优美的演奏。演出是以民族器乐队全体合奏落花曲开始的；乐队是以阿富汗的民族乐器和一支小号、一支曼德林、一个坐式手风琴组成的。阿富汗王国是一个有着悠久古老文化的国家，艺术家们所演奏的古老的民族乐器，是我们平常很少见到的，如锁林大，这是一种有着三条弦的拉弦乐器，它的形状很奇特，有些像古老的小提琴，但用兽皮作共鸣板，边上安着许多条细小的共鸣弦，用弓子拉奏起来，声音非常悠扬动听。又如一种较大的中音拨弹乐器罗抱勃，有点像我国新疆维吾尔族的民族乐器热阿浦，有四条弦，演奏起来声音铿锵好听。这些乐器不仅有着它古老独特的形式和演奏方法，而且有着它特有的音响，加上艺术家富于民族色彩的动人的歌唱，仿佛把我们带到了四面环山的阿富汗高原，听到了淳厚朴实的阿富汗农民演唱着古老的民歌。阿富汗人民非常喜欢唱歌，他们常常在喜庆的日子或节日里，围在家里通宵演唱，演唱那些富有诗意的长本大套的叙事歌曲。这次歌唱家海牙儿、纳金、都尔先生等的演唱都各有特色，如海牙儿先生所演唱的由布里希纳先生作曲的两首爱情歌曲，表达得细致深情；歌唱家纳金和哈坦姆先生所唱的几首普什图民歌，就显得生动活泼富于生气，这和普什图族勇敢强悍的性格是有关系的。歌唱家演唱的中国歌曲受到了听众特别热烈的欢迎，听众以惊奇的神情倾听着歌唱家演唱的中国歌曲《新疆好》，他唱得这样好是难得的，这表现了中阿人民之间深厚的友谊。
    观众对阿富汗鼓的独奏发生了特别的兴趣，这种鼓很像一个中国古瓷花瓶，由陶瓶做瓶，羊皮蒙鼓，瓶上镶着很精美的金色花纹装饰，这种鼓放在怀里用双手演奏，演奏者默兰格·内凡勒维先生的双手在鼓上时而缓慢地有节奏地敲奏，奏出了抒情的慢技，时而在鼓上疾驰，奏出了急风暴雨般的节奏；演奏者运用双手巧妙的敲击，鼓心鼓边，奏出了千变万化的音色和节奏，观众热烈地要求再来。值得提出的是民族乐队中还加入了两件西洋乐器，小号和曼德林，也演奏得极好，并不觉得不协调，那是因为小号和曼德林的演奏方法也民族化了，这是很有意思的。阿富汗王国音乐歌唱队在北京的演出是成功的，受到了北京听众热烈的欢迎。
    这次阿富汗王国音乐歌唱队在京的演出，使我感到特别亲切，那是因为我曾于1958年夏随天津歌舞团去到阿富汗王国庆祝独立节四十周年，访问了喀布尔和坎大哈两个城市，进行了近一个月的演出。我们到处都受到了王国政府和人民热情的、友好的接待和欢迎，特别是我们被邀参加了独立节盛大的军事检阅观礼，我们看到了英勇的阿富汗军民在四十年前击败英帝国主义侵略的光荣炮，知道了阿富汗王国历史上几次英勇的反帝斗争，使我们肃然起敬。当我们在喀布尔体育场为参加民族节日的三万观众举行广场演出时，广大的阿富汗人民对中国的歌舞艺术发生了强烈的兴趣。演毕还恋恋不舍，纷纷向演员道谢。当我们在喀布尔和坎大哈为女子学校、妇女协会举行妇女专场演出时，阿富汗妇女除去了面罩以亲人的礼节接待我们，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们还和喀布尔电台的音乐家们举行了亲切的座谈，互相介绍了音乐发展情况，交换了音乐资料，所有这些都增进了两国的文化交流，互相学到了许多好的有益的东西。特别使我们记忆不忘的是阿富汗王国国王亲自接见了艺术团的领导人，首相达乌德亲自上台给演员赠花，这标志着两国之间深厚的友谊。这次，阿富汗王国音乐歌唱队又首次来到我们国家举行访问演出，我相信，通过这次成功的访问演出，将更加增进我们中阿两国人民之间、艺术家之间亲密的友谊。祝艺术家们在我国其他各城市的演出中获得更大的成功！
