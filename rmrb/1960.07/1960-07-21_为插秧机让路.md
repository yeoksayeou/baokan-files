    Making Way for the Rice Transplanter

    Secretary Li of the General Branch said to me, "Old Wan, you are a provincial-level advanced worker. The Party is calling on all sectors to support agriculture, and you must take the lead in this area!" I said, "I will definitely follow the direction pointed out by the Party, work diligently, and complete the tasks assigned by the Party." Secretary Li nodded and said, "The four counties in Jiangnan are rich in Phyllostachys pubescens, but most of their bamboo shells for water bottles are still produced by hand. We must help them improve production and increase income. This task is assigned to you."

    To promote the production of bamboo shells for water bottles in rural areas, the first thing to solve is to change from manual operation to mechanical operation. This requires a large number of bamboo-splitting machines to replace the manual operation, which requires the highest skills and the largest amount of labor. But where can bamboo-splitting machines be produced? I went to the factories to inquire and heard that the state-owned Dongfang Farm Implement Factory had this machine. I rushed there as fast as I could, found the factory leaders, and repeatedly explained my intention. Finally, I signed a contract to purchase bamboo-splitting machines. At this moment, I was really overjoyed, thinking: I have broken through a major barrier.

    A few days later, I was just walking into the Dongfang Farm Implement Factory to check on the production situation when I happened to encounter a spot meeting held here by the Qiaokou District Committee. The main purpose of this spot meeting was to implement the principle of everything for the sake of the rice transplanter, and all other production had to give way temporarily. At this time, the bamboo-splitting machines I needed became a problem. But I immediately thought of what Secretary Li said, "We must establish a strong idea of supporting agriculture." Although both rice transplanters and bamboo-splitting machines are needed by the countryside, rice transplanting is time-sensitive. If they are not all produced before the rice transplanting season, it will affect the bumper harvest of agriculture. I decided to support the production of rice transplanters first. I immediately went to the workshop to discuss with the workers and find out what difficulties there were in producing rice transplanters. The workers said, "The main problem is the lack of power, which prevents us from producing a complete set, and it may affect the agricultural season."

    On this day, I ran to more than a dozen factories in one breath, but there was no way to solve it. Seeing that dusk was approaching, I was still running into walls everywhere, but when I thought of the eagerness of the peasant brothers for rice transplanters, I forgot my fatigue and hurried to the Jiancai Factory, which had a close relationship with us, at a brisk pace. I asked them to temporarily squeeze out a motor that was in use to support the Dongfang Farm Implement Factory in the production of rice transplanters. The leaders of the Jiancai Factory readily agreed to my request when they heard that it was needed for the production of rice transplanters. At this time, it made me feel like a big stone had been lifted from my heart. I reported the work of this day to Secretary Li, and Secretary Li encouraged me again, telling me to do more good things to promote the development of community-run industries and support agricultural production. And decided to support the Dongfang Farm Implement Factory with blowers and white steel knives that had been prepared to support other factories to form a complete set for production.

    The next day, before dawn, when the comrades were still sound asleep, I quietly got up cheerfully, carried the blower on my back, and took the white steel knife to the Jiancai Factory, and together with the chairman of the trade union of the factory, sent the motor to the Dongfang Farm Implement Factory. The workers were extremely happy, and the production efficiency was greatly improved. Not only did they complete the task of producing rice transplanters ahead of schedule, but they also rushed to manufacture forty bamboo-splitting machines to support the needs of the countryside, which quickly changed the face of bamboo shell production in the four counties of Jiangnan, and the output increased steadily.

    为插秧机让路
    武汉市百货公司加工采购员　万绍杰
    总支李书记对我说：“老万，你是全省的先进工作者，党号召我们各行各业都要支援农业，你在这方面也要起个带头作用罗！”我说：“一定按照党指出的方向，踏踏实实地干，完成党所交给的任务。”李书记点着头又说：“江南四个县盛产楠竹，但他们生产的水瓶竹壳还大部分靠手工操作，一定要帮助他们提高生产，增加收入，这一任务就交给你了。”
    要促进农村的水瓶竹壳生产，首先要解决变手工操作为机械操作，这就需要大量的劈篾机来代替技术最高、劳动量最大的手工操作。但是哪里能生产劈篾机呢？我到工厂去打听，听说国营东方农具厂有这个机器。我飞也似地赶到那里，找到厂方领导，反复地说明来意，终于签订了购买劈篾机的合同。这时，我心里真是乐开了花，心想：闯破了一个大关。
    过了几天，我正走进东方农具厂去联系生产情况，刚好碰上硚口区委在这里召开现场会议。这个现场会主要是贯彻一切为插秧机而战，其他的生产暂时都得让路。这时，我需要的劈篾机成了问题。但我立刻想到李书记说的“要树立一个坚强的支援农业的思想”，插秧机和劈篾机虽然都是农村要的，但插秧是有时间性的，如果不在插秧季节前全部生产出来，就要影响农业大丰收，我决定了首先要支持插秧机生产，立即到车间与工人一起商量，了解生产插秧机还有什么困难。工人同志说：主要是缺乏动力，不能成龙配套生产，恐怕会影响农时。”
    这一天，我一口气跑了十多个工厂，但都没有办法解决。眼看天近黄昏了，我还在到处碰壁，但我想到农民兄弟对插秧机迫切渴望的心情，就忘掉了疲劳，连忙三步当作两步走地跑到与我们关系密切的建材工厂。我要求他们把正在使用的马达临时挤出一部来支援东方农具厂生产插秧机。建材厂的领导听说是生产插秧机需要，就毫不犹豫地答应了我的要求。这时使我心里像放下了一块大石头一样。我把这一天的工作向李书记汇报了，李书记又鼓励我，叫我为促进社办工业发展，支援农业生产多办好事。并决定把已准备支援其他工厂的鼓风机和白钢刀支援东方农具厂成龙配套生产。
    第二天，天还没有大亮，同志们睡意正浓，我悄悄地爬起来愉快地背起了鼓风机，拿着白钢刀到建材工厂，与该厂工会主席一道把马达送到了东方农具厂。工人们高兴极了，生产效率也大大提高了。不仅提前完成了生产插秧机的任务，同时还赶制了四十台劈篾机支援农村需要，使江南四个县的水瓶竹壳生产也很快地改变了面貌，产量节节上升。
