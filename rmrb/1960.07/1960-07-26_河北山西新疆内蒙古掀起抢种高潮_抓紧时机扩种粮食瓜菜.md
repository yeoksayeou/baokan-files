Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 25th: Hebei Province is making every effort to continue expanding the planting of late autumn crops. As of July 15th, the province had interplanted and intercropped in spring and summer sown crop fields, and expanded planting on idle land, reaching over 41 million mu.

After a long drought, most areas of Hebei Province have received rainfall since July. Party committees and the broad masses of cadres and people enthusiastically responded to the provincial party committee's call to vigorously expand the planting of high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, and rice, and increase the multiple cropping index. Zhangjiakou Prefecture has widely launched the "Clever Planting, Full Planting" campaign. Based on the principle that tall and short crop stalks do not affect each other's growth, over 7 million mu of grain crops and vegetables have been interplanted and intercropped in the over 19 million mu of spring and summer sown crops. Xinglong County in Chengde City has set off a high tide of rushing to plant. The masses are actively devising methods and offering suggestions to find vacant land, interplanting tall-stalk crops in short-stalk crop fields, using "field edges, roadsides, and house sides" to sow grain and vegetables, and vigorously developing oil material mountains and oil material slopes, seeking grain and oil from barren mountains and slopes. In just three days, the county rushed to plant over 7,400 mu of corn, peanuts, sesame, and other crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 25th: People's communes in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively expanding the summer planting area. Areas that have received rainfall are taking advantage of the good weather after the rain to rush to plant various grains and vegetables. According to recent incomplete statistics, the province has already summer-sown 8.22 million mu, completing 115% of the summer sowing plan, of which 6.54 million mu were replanted in wheat stubble fields, reaching 92% of the original plan.

The Jinan Prefecture has added over 500,000 laborers and over 100,000 draft animals to the replanting front, greatly accelerating the replanting speed. The entire prefecture has now sown 4 million mu, exceeding the replanting plan by 500,000 mu, and is striving to plant another 200,000 mu. The Jindongnan Prefecture has also exceeded the replanting plan by approximately 200,000 mu. All localities have attached great importance to the quality of sowing. Many areas have applied base fertilizer in conjunction with sowing, and the emergence of seedlings in most fields is currently good.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: Party committees at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have mobilized the broad masses of commune members to launch a vigorous summer planting upsurge in conjunction with the summer harvest. As of July 15th, the region had sown 1 million mu of corn, sorghum, millet, beans, vegetables, and other crops. In Hotan Prefecture, where wheat harvesting began earlier, the summer sowing area has reached 62% of the summer harvest area. Currently, the entire region is advancing at a rate of over 80,000 mu per day.

All parts of the autonomous region have carefully arranged crop varieties in accordance with local conditions and seasons, ensuring that whatever can be planted is planted. Southern Xinjiang and the Turpan Basin, which have long frost-free periods, are mainly planting grain crops. Northern Xinjiang, which only began promoting summer sowing this year, is vigorously expanding the planting area of green manure crops in accordance with the cooler climate. People's communes near cities and towns have mostly prioritized the production of vegetables and melons.

This newspaper, Hohhot, July 25th: Various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are rushing to plant late autumn crops.

Currently, the 1.2 million mu of newly planted late autumn crops in the Zhelimumeng, located in the Xiliao River Basin, are of good quality, ensuring full emergence of seedlings. The Central Agricultural Reclamation Army has sown drought-resistant and early-maturing millet on the barren land of the Xiertala Ranch, and all the seedlings have emerged and are growing well. In Tuoketuo County, Xinghe County, suburban areas of Jining City, and other places in Ulanqabmeng, various communes have adopted the method of reclaiming land while sowing, planting over 100,000 mu of small millet and buckwheat, and forage grass in a short period of time. According to preliminary statistics from five leagues, including Zhaowuda, Zhelimumeng, Ulanqab, Yikezhao, and Bayannur, over 3.6 million mu of early-maturing crops such as buckwheat and millet have been planted.

    河北山西新疆内蒙古掀起抢种高潮
    抓紧时机扩种粮食瓜菜
    据新华社天津25日电　河北各地千方百计继续扩种晚秋作物。到7月15日止，全省单是在春、夏播作物地里间作套种和利用闲散土地扩种即达四千一百多万亩。
    久旱的河北省，从7月以来大部地区陆续降雨。各地党委和广大干部群众热烈响应省委号召，突击扩种甘薯、玉米、水稻等高产作物和提高复种指数。张家口地区普遍开展了“巧种田、种满田”运动，根据作物秸秆高矮互不影响生长的原则，在已播种的一千九百多万亩春夏播作物中，间种套种了七百多万亩粮食作物和蔬菜。承德市兴隆县掀起抢种高潮，群众积极想办法，献计策，查找空闲地，在矮秆作物地里间种高秆作物，利用“十边四旁”播种粮菜，大搞油料山、油料坡，向荒山、荒坡要粮油，仅三天时间，全县就抢种玉米、花生、芝麻等七千四百多亩。
    据新华社太原25日电　山西省各地人民公社积极扩大夏种面积。已落雨地区正趁雨后大好时机，抢种各种粮菜。据最近的不完全统计，全省已夏播八百二十二万亩，完成了夏播计划的115％，其中麦茬田复播了六百五十四万亩，达到了原计划的92％。
    晋南专区在复播战线上增加五十多万劳力和十万多头畜力，大大加快了复播速度。全区现已播种四百万亩，超额五十万亩完成复播计划，力争再多种二十万亩。晋东南专区也超额约二十万亩完成复播计划。各地都十分重视播种质量，许多地区都结合播种施上底肥，目前绝大部分田禾出苗情况良好。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各级党委，发动广大人民公社社员，结合夏收，掀起一个声势浩大的夏种高潮。截至7月15日统计，全区已播种玉米、高粱、糜子、豆类、蔬菜等一百万亩。小麦开镰较早的和田地区，夏播面积已达夏收面积的62％。目前全疆正以日播八万多亩的速度向前挺进。
    自治区各地都因地因时制宜地认真安排了作物品种，作到能种什么就种什么。无霜期长的南疆和吐鲁番盆地，都以种植粮食作物为主。今年才开始推广夏播的北疆地区，根据气候较凉的特点，大力扩大绿肥种植面积；靠近市区和城镇的人民公社，大都首先安排了蔬菜和瓜类生产。
    本报呼和浩特25日电　内蒙古自治区各地抢种晚秋作物。
    目前，位于西辽河流域的哲里木盟，新近种上的一百二十多万亩晚秋作物，质量很好，抓住了全苗。中央农垦大军在谢尔塔拉牧场荒地上播种耐旱早熟的糜子，也已全部出齐苗，生长良好。乌兰察布盟托克托县、兴和县、集宁市郊区等地，各公社采取边开荒边播种的方法，短时内就种上了十多万亩小糜黍、荞麦、饲草。据昭乌达、哲里木、乌兰察布、伊克昭、巴彦淖尔等五个盟初步统计，已种上荞麦、糜子等早熟作物三百六十多万亩。
