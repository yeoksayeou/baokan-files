　　When My Daughter Isn't Home

　　One midday, the weather was stifling hot. An old woman, around fifty years old, carrying a bundle in one hand and leading a child with the other, followed by another child, came from the bus stop and headed straight for the Red Flag Happiness Courtyard of our Xinhua People's Commune.

　　The old woman thought as she walked: My daughter started working in the city two months ago when they were setting up communes. She said in her letter that she’d be off work today, so that's why I rushed to bring the two children to her today. But what if something came up for her and I missed her? What would I do?

　　"Granny, are you visiting? Who are you going to see? Let me help you with that bundle." As soon as the old woman entered the courtyard, Jing Shuqing, a service worker at our Happiness Courtyard, greeted her warmly and led her straight to her daughter, Wang Shuzhen's, room. The old woman entered the room, saw that her daughter wasn't there, and noticed two rows of keys hanging on the wall. She wondered if she'd come to the wrong place. Seeing that the old woman looked a bit dazed, the service worker, Xiao Jing, quickly stepped forward and said to the old woman, "Please rest! Wang Shuzhen had something come up and had to go to work today. I'm a service worker here at the courtyard, and I can take care of anything for her." With that, Xiao Jing poured a basin of water for the old woman to wash her face and bought a pack of cigarettes from the courtyard's sales agency. Then, she busied herself cooking for the old woman. Before long, the meal was ready. The old woman happily said, "Now I know what you mean by turning the courtyard into a 'hotel.' Next time I come, I won't have to worry about whether my daughter is off work or not."

　　闺女不在家的时候
    一天晌午，天气闷热闷热的。一位年约五十岁上下的老大娘，一只手提着包袱，手里搀了一个小孩，旁边还跟了一个孩子，从公共汽车站出来，直奔我们新华人民公社红旗幸福大院来了。
    老大娘一边走，一边想：女儿在两个月前城里搞公社化的时候就参加工作了，因为她信上说今天休息，所以才赶这个日子把两个孩子给她送来的。可是万一她临时有啥事，遇不着，那怎么办呢？
    “大娘，您是串门的吧？到谁家去？我来帮您拿包袱。”大娘刚一进院，我们幸福大院的服务员景淑清就热情地招呼着，一直把大娘领到她女儿王淑真的屋子里。大娘一进屋看到女儿不在，又看见墙上挂着两排钥匙，心里有些纳闷，是不是走错人家了？服务员小景看出大娘有些发楞，就赶紧上前对大娘说：“您休息吧！王淑真今天临时有事到班上去了。我是大院的服务员，有啥事我可以替她办。”说着，小景给大娘倒了一盆洗脸水，又到大院代销店买了盒烟。接着又忙着给大娘做饭。不一会儿，饭做好了。大娘高兴地说：“这回可知道你们大院搞什么‘旅馆化’了，我下回再来就用不着管我女儿休班不休班了。”
