    Seize the Favorable Opportunities of Summer and Replant High-Yield Crops

    Summer has high temperatures and abundant rainfall, suitable for the growth of various crops, and is the most favorable season for replanting high-yield crops. In accordance with the state's planting plan, increasing replanting and planting more high-yield crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and corn is of decisive significance for ensuring the realization of a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn.
    Replanting can make full use of the growing season and exploit the potential of the land, making it an effective measure for increasing production and income. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to large-scale farmland capital construction, the various factors restricting replanting, such as soil, fertilizer, and water, have largely ceased to exist, which is a favorable condition for implementing replanting at present.
    According to the experience of northern provinces, changing from one crop a year to two crops a year generally increases production by about 10%; in high cases, it can be doubled. Changing from two crops in three years to two crops in one year can increase production by about 20%. Even changing from one crop a year to three crops in two years can increase production by 10%-20%. As for changing from one crop a year to three crops a year, the benefits are even greater, often more than doubled. The yield increase benefits of replanting in the south are also significant.
    Replanting high-yield crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and corn results in high yields and large returns, and their by-products have many uses. Rice straw, corn stalks, and sweet potato vines are excellent coarse feed for pigs and draught animals. Rice bran and corn cobs are also pig feed.
    China has a vast territory and complex conditions, so summer replanting must also be adapted to local conditions. In double-cropping rice areas, summer replanting is mainly late rice. Every effort should be made to harvest early rice and transplant late rice around "Great Heat." If water sources are insufficient or early sweet potato areas are not large enough in these areas, autumn sweet potatoes should be vigorously replanted. Southern autumn sweet potatoes are generally transplanted around "Start of Autumn," so they can also regulate the labor tension during the double rush of double-cropping rice.
    In rice-wheat double-cropping areas, rice-wheat double-cropping has higher yields and income than planting single-season rice or wheat and other crops with two crops a year. In these areas, to cultivate rice in wheat fields, it is necessary to immediately release water and plow and harrow after the wheat harvest, spread organic fertilizer, and meticulously plow and harrow to eliminate the soil clods and cracks formed during dryland farming (wheat), so that it does not leak water or fertilizer. Since the rice growing season is still long after transplanting until the sowing of the subsequent wheat crop, in order to make full use of light energy and increase material accumulation, varieties with later maturity, cold resistance, and rice stem borer resistance should be selected.
    In the winter wheat area of the Yellow River basin, it is best to replant summer corn, summer sweet potatoes, and summer millet after the wheat harvest. These crops have high and stable yields. At the same time, expanding summer planting is the only way to change from two crops in three years to two crops in one year, or from one crop in one year to two crops in one year or three crops in two years in the winter wheat area of the Yellow River basin.

    抓紧夏季有利时机，复种高产作物
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所技术考查组
    夏季气温高、雨量充沛，适于各种作物生长，是复种高产作物的最有利的季节。按照国家种植计划任务，增加复种，多种水稻、甘薯、玉米等高产作物，对保证实现秋季全面丰收有着决定性意义。
    复种，可以充分利用生长季节，发挥土地潜力，是增产增收的有效措施。大跃进以来，由于大搞农田基本建设，限制复种的土、肥、水等各项因素，在很大程度上已经不存在了，这是当前实行复种的有利条件。
    根据北方各省经验，一年一熟改为一年二熟，一般增产在10％左右；高者可达一倍，二年三熟改为一年二熟，则可增产20％左右，甚至一年一熟改为二年三熟，也能增产10％—20％，至于一年一熟改为一年三熟，收益就更加提高，常在一倍以上。南方复种的增产效益同样显著。
    复种水稻、甘薯、玉米等高产作物，产量高、收益大，它们的副产品用途繁多。稻草、玉米秸和薯蔓是猪和耕畜的优良粗饲料。稻糠玉米轴又是猪的精料。
    我国幅员辽阔、条件复杂，因而夏季复种，也必须因地制宜。在双季稻地区，夏季复种主要是晚稻，应该千方百计地在“大暑”前后收完早稻、插上晚稻。这样地区如果水源不足或早薯面积不够，应当大力复种秋薯。南方秋薯一般在“立秋”前后插秧，所以又能调节双季稻双抢时的劳力紧张。
    在稻麦两熟地区，稻麦两熟比种单季稻或小麦和其他作物的一年两熟产量收益要高。这些地区在麦地栽培水稻，必须在麦收后立即放水犁耙，铺施有机肥料，必需精细犁耙，消灭旱作（小麦）时形成的土块裂隙，使其不漏水漏肥。由于插秧后至后作小麦播种前，水稻生长期尚长，为充分利用光能，增加物质积累，应当选用较晚熟、有耐寒力和抗螟力的品种。
    在黄河流域冬麦区麦收后，以复种夏玉米、夏甘薯、夏谷子等最好，这些作物产量高而稳。同时，扩大夏种才有可能使黄河流域冬麦区二年三熟改为一年二熟，或者一年一熟改为一年二熟、二年三熟。
