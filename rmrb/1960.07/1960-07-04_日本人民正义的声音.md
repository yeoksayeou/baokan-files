    The just voice of the Japanese people
    Secretary Masaharu Hatanaka of the Japan Peace Committee said: The purpose of the Japanese people's struggle is to abolish the (Japan-U.S.) "Security Treaty" and make Japan a truly independent country. The Japanese people must free themselves from the multiple military, political, and economic shackles of U.S. imperialism.
    Takayo Sakai, a young worker from Nagano Prefecture, said: Our lives are very poor, and we yearn for Japan to become an independent, peaceful, and democratic country as soon as possible. We demand that the American scoundrels go back home! Japan wants to be peaceful and friendly with all countries in the world. To this end, we must fight to the end against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"!
    Takao Kobayashi, a farmer from Yamanashi Prefecture, said: Farmers have been deceived by the government many times in the past, and now they will never be deceived again. More and more people in the countryside are saying that we should change our government.
    Professor Hiroshi Minami of Hitotsubashi University said: The Japan-U.S. military alliance formed under the "Security Treaty" is a new threat to world peace. This is not the path Japan should take.
    Commentator Kenzo Nakajima said: The actions of the Liberal Democrats show that they are more autocratic than Syngman Rhee himself. Nobusuke Kishi is a true fascist.
    Commentator Aono said: Although I am seventy years old, I am still determined to be an active participant in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" and fight to the end.
    Iku Hara, a housewife from Sendai, said: The Japanese reactionaries may seem powerful, but there is nothing to fear in the face of the people's just struggle.
    Ichizo Yamamoto, a member of the Tokyo "Self-Defense Forces," said: We, like the working people, are poor and suffering people. In any case, we must swear: I and our comrades will never take up guns to participate in a wrong war. (with picture)

    日本人民正义的声音
    日本和平委员会书记畑中政春说：日本人民斗争的目的，是要废除（日美）“安全条约”，使日本真正成为独立的国家。日本人民一定要从美帝国主义军事的、政治的、经济的重重束缚中解放出来。
    长野县青年工人坂井高洋说：我们的生活非常贫苦，我们向往着日本早日变成独立、和平、民主的国家。我们要求美国佬滚回老家去！日本要和世界各国都和平友好。为了这个目的，我们要为反对日美“安全条约”斗争到底！
    山梨县农民小林孝雄说：农民们过去曾经许多次被政府欺骗，现在他们决不会再受欺骗了。在乡下有越来越多的人说，我们应该改换我们的政府。
    一桥大学教授南博说：根据“安全条约”而结成的日美军事同盟，对世界和平是一个新的威胁。这不是日本所应走的道路。
    评论家中岛健藏说：自由民主党人的行为表明他们自己比李承晚更为专制。岸信介是真正的法西斯分子。
    评论家青野说：虽然我已经七十岁了，但是我仍然决心要做一个反对新“安全条约”斗争的积极分子，斗争到最后。
    仙台家庭妇女原伊久说：日本反动派看起来好像强大，但在人民正义斗争面前没有可怕的地方。
    东京“自卫队”队员山本一三说：我们和劳动人民一样，是受穷受苦的人。不论怎样，我们要宣誓：我和我们的同志绝对不拿起枪杆子来参加错误的战争。（附图片）
