Editorial:

    In the first half of this year, like the industrial production front, the staff and workers of the capital construction department have also made great achievements. Many key projects have been rapidly put into production, adding new strength to the continued leap forward in production this year. Qinghai Province has provided a good set of experiences in this regard. Under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," the province prioritizes supporting agriculture and raw material industries such as coal and iron in its construction projects. It effectively organizes existing materials, equipment, and construction forces, with leaders going deep into the construction sites to solve problems promptly and specifically. From late April to June 15th, it fought four "annihilation battles." As a result, the completed construction area in more than fifty days increased nearly five times compared to the first quarter, enabling many key projects to be quickly completed and put into production and use.
    The main method used by Qinghai Province to achieve this significant accomplishment is to concentrate superior forces, guarantee key projects, engage in batch-by-batch concentrated attacks, and fight annihilation battles. This is a proven experience for the capital construction front to fully and rationally use manpower and materials to accelerate construction progress. As the capital construction workers in Qinghai Province said, "Concentrating forces is a treasure, batch-by-batch concentrated attacks are highly efficient, guaranteeing key projects drives overall progress, and this is the path to more, faster, better, and more economical results."
    To implement the principle of "concentrating superior forces, guaranteeing key projects, engaging in batch-by-batch concentrated attacks, and fighting annihilation battles," the first step is to do a good job in prioritizing construction projects. Prioritization of construction projects should be done nationally, and also at the local level; it should be done annually, quarterly, and also in batches and phases. This is a regular task. How can we prioritize well? The fundamental principle is to implement the guideline of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," following the idea of "the overall situation first, key projects first," and making comprehensive arrangements for capital construction projects based on overall needs and the combination of long-term and short-term considerations. In making arrangements, we must proceed from reality, seek truth from facts, and comprehensively consider subjective and objective conditions. The plan should be both proactive and advanced, and the number of projects should be appropriate and reliable. We must ensure that the manpower and materials that can be used for capital construction are fully utilized, while also avoiding occupying too much manpower and materials, so as not to hinder agricultural production and other production. After the overall arrangement, the specific combat deployment should weigh the importance and urgency of capital construction projects according to one's own materials, equipment, and construction forces, and engage in batch-by-batch concentrated attacks and fight annihilation battles. Only in this way can we ensure that key projects are launched quickly and completed and put into production as soon as possible. Concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects is not just a methodological issue, but also a concrete implementation of the overall line's strategic deployment. Key projects are the backbone projects of socialist construction and are decisive. Only by building key projects quickly and well can we drive the entire construction undertaking to continuously move forward. If we do not distinguish between priorities and emergencies, key and non-key projects, and spread the capital construction front too widely, and advance on all fronts simultaneously, we will inevitably disperse our forces and fail to ensure that key projects are quickly completed and put into production. At the same time, it may also inappropriately occupy too much manpower and materials, hindering other important production, such as agricultural production. Therefore, we must fully understand the important significance of the strategic deployment of concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects. Chairman Mao said in "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "Concentrating forces seems easy, but it is difficult to implement. Everyone knows that defeating the few with the many is the best method, but many people cannot do it. On the contrary, they often disperse their forces, because the leaders lack strategic thinking." Leaders of relevant departments in various regions must firmly establish this strategic viewpoint and make reasonable prioritizations for construction projects in the second half of the year. When prioritizing, projects that are most urgently needed for the development of the national economy, that have quick investment returns, and that play a backbone role (including related "small foreign groups" projects) should be listed as key projects. At the same time, we must first ensure the key projects arranged by the state.
    Agriculture is the foundation of our national economy, so when prioritizing, key projects supporting agriculture should be given priority, and efforts should be concentrated to ensure completion on schedule or ahead of schedule.
    Another key to implementing the principle of "concentrating superior forces, guaranteeing key projects, engaging in batch-by-batch concentrated attacks, and fighting annihilation battles" is to focus on projects that must be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. When arranging capital construction projects, not only the start time should be arranged, but more importantly, the completion time should be arranged. Completion and putting into production is the purpose of capital construction. Grasping completion and putting into production is the "key link" for the capital construction department to strive for high speed. Once the prioritization of construction projects and the completion time of the projects are determined, a unified command headquarters of the construction units, design units, and construction units should be immediately organized to vigorously promote communist collaboration, unified scheduling of materials, equipment, construction forces, and transportation forces, concentrating superior forces, starting a batch, preparing a batch; completing a batch, and then building another batch. The construction department should concentrate the excellent forces of various types of work according to the requirements of the project completion date, adopt new construction technologies as much as possible, seize the project progress, and seize the finishing work, and ensure completion on schedule and ahead of schedule on the premise of ensuring quality.
    Another important concrete measure for the capital construction department to implement the principle of concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects is to rely on its own efforts to vigorously develop the raw material industry. Why can Qinghai Province quickly complete and put into production and deliver many key projects? It is because they have implemented diversified operations and established a number of factories for cement, bricks, tiles, white ash, and particleboard, achieving partial or complete self-sufficiency. This is an important reason why they can ensure the completion of key projects on schedule or ahead of schedule. Qinghai Province has achieved such remarkable achievements in capital construction in the first half of this year because it has both seized the key of putting into production and delivery within a limited time, and also carried out various specific organizational work in a down-to-earth manner, resulting in a great acceleration of the progress of key projects.
    The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China not only puts capital construction in an important position, but also adopted many effective measures to improve the style of leadership. Leaders at all levels of the capital construction department throughout the province can go deep into the front line, work alongside the workers, and solve various specific problems in the progress of the project at any time. This down-to-earth style of leadership greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the workers and cadres, creating important conditions for the successful implementation of the principle of "concentrating superior forces, guaranteeing key projects, engaging in batch-by-batch concentrated attacks, and fighting annihilation battles." After the leading cadres of the capital construction department of Qinghai Province went deep into the front line, the construction workers praised them, saying, "The leaders come to the construction site, labor by our side, problems are solved quickly, and our enthusiasm soars to the ninth heaven." It is this force of the combination of leaders and the masses that ensures that every "battle" is won steadily.
    Capital construction is an important front for social construction, and key projects are the main force among the new forces of industrial production. We hope that all regions will be like Qinghai, urging them to jump on their horses and enter the battle as soon as possible!

    集中力量加快重点工程进度
    今年上半年，和工业生产战线上一样，基本建设部门的职工，也取得了很大成就，许多重点工程迅速投入生产，为今年的生产继续跃进增加了新的力量。青海省在这方面提供了一套好经验。这个省在全国一盘棋的方针指导下，把支援农业和煤、铁等原材料工业等建设项目放在首要地位，很好地组织现有的材料、设备和施工力量，领导深入工地，及时地具体地解决问题，从4月下旬到6月15日打了四次“歼灭战”，结果，五十多天竣工的工程面积比第一季度增长将近五倍，使许多重点项目迅速建成投入生产和交付使用。
    青海省取得这一重大成绩的主要办法，是集中优势力量，保证重点工程，分批突击，打歼灭战。这是基本建设战线充分合理地使用人力、物力，加快建设进度的屡用屡成的经验。正如青海省基本建设职工所说：“集中力量是件宝，分批突击效率高，保证重点带全面，多快好省路一条。”
    要贯彻执行“集中优势力量，保证重点，分批突击，打歼灭战”的方针，首先要做好建设项目排队工作。建设项目排队，全国要排，各地方也要排；年年要排，季季要排，还要分批分期地排，这是一件经常性的工作。怎样才能把队排好呢？根本的一条是贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，按照全局第一、重点第一的思想，根据整体需要和长远与近期相结合的原则，对基本建设项目作全面安排。在安排的时候要从实际出发，实事求是地全面考虑主观和客观条件，把计划安排得既积极先进，工程数量又适当可靠；既要使可以用于基本建设的人力、物力充分发挥作用，又要避免占用过多的人力物力，以免妨碍农业生产和其他生产。在总体安排以后，具体的战斗部署，又要根据自己的材料、设备、施工力量，对基本建设项目权衡轻重缓急，分批分期打歼灭战。只有这样，才能保证重点工程迅速上马，早日竣工投入生产。集中力量，保证重点，不仅仅是个方法问题，而且是具体贯彻执行总路线的战略部署问题。重点工程是社会主义建设的骨干项目，是带有决定性的，只有把重点项目建设得又快又好，才能带动整个建设事业不断向前发展。如果我们不分轻重缓急，不分重点和非重点，一下把基本建设的摊子铺得很大，而且齐头并进，就必然要分散力量，不能保证重点项目迅速建成投入生产，同时还可能不适当地占用了过多的人力、物力，妨碍了其他重要的生产，比如农业生产。因此，我们要很好地领会集中力量、保证重点这一战略部署的重要意义。毛主席在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一文中说：“集中兵力看来容易，实行颇难。人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法，然而很多人不能做，相反地每每分散兵力，原因就在于指导者缺乏战略头脑”。各地有关部门的领导人员要切实树立起这种战略观点，对下半年的建设项目作合理的排队。在排队的时候，应该把发展国民经济最急需的、发挥投资效果快的和起骨干作用的建设项目（包括有关的“小洋群”工程）列为重点，同时要首先保证国家安排的重点项目。
    农业是我国国民经济的基础，因此在排队的时候，应当把支援农业的重点项目放在优先地位，并且要集中力量保证按期或提前建成。
    贯彻执行“集中优势力量，保证重点，分批突击，打歼灭战”方针的另一关键，是要大抓必须按期或提前竣工的项目。在安排基本建设项目的时候，不仅要安排开工时间，更重要的是安排竣工时间。竣工投入生产才是基本建设的目的。抓竣工投入生产，是基本建设部门争取高速度的“提纲挈领”的工作。建设项目排队和工程竣工时间一经确定，要立即具体组织建设单位、设计单位、施工单位的统一指挥部，大搞共产主义协作，统一调度材料、设备、施工力量和运输力量，集中优势兵力，开工一批，准备一批；建成一批，再建一批。施工部门应该根据工程竣工日期的要求，采取“计划倒排”的办法集中各工种的优秀力量，尽可能采用施工的新技术，抓紧工程进度，抓紧扫尾工程，在确保质量的前提下，保证按期和提前建成。
    基本建设部门贯彻集中力量保证重点方针的另一个重要的具体措施，是自力更生大办原材料工业。青海省为什么能使许多重点项目迅速建成并投入生产和交付使用呢？就是因为他们自己实行了多种经营，办起了一批水泥、砖瓦、白灰、刨花板等工厂，做到了部分自给或全部自给，这是他们能够保证重点项目按期或提前建成的一个重要原因。青海省今年上半年在基本建设中取得这样显著成绩，就是由于既抓紧了限期投入生产和交付使用这一关，又扎扎实实地进行了各种具体的组织工作，结果大大加快了重点工程的进度。
    中共青海省委不仅把基本建设放在重要地位，而且采取了许多改进领导作风的有力措施。全省基本建设部门各级领导人员都能深入第一线，跟班劳动，随时解决工程进展中的各种具体问题。这种踏踏实实的领导作风，大大鼓舞了广大工人和干部的积极性，为很好地贯彻执行“集中优势力量，保证重点，分批突击，打歼灭战”的方针，创造了重要条件。青海省基本建设部门的领导干部深入第一线以后，建筑工人们歌颂说“领导到工地，劳动在身边，问题解决快，干劲冲九天。”正是这一股领导和群众相结合的力量，保证了每次“战役”都稳操胜券。
    基本建设是社会建设的一条重要战线，重点工程是工业生产生力军当中的主力，希望各地都像青海一样，催它们早日跃马上阵！
