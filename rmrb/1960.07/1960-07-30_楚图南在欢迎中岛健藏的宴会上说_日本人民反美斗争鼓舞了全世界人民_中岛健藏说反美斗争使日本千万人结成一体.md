Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, his wife, and their accompanying staff member, Shirato Go.

Chu Tunan spoke at the banquet, warmly welcoming Mr. Nakajima Kenzo and his wife. He pointed out that the Japanese people's twenty-two magnificent nationwide unified actions against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and several large-scale political general strikes have shaken the entire world and greatly inspired the world's peace-loving people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and in defense of world peace. This great struggle of the Japanese people is also a great support for the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction.

Chu Tunan said that through practical struggle, the Japanese people have realized that their real enemy is U.S. imperialism and have found ways to fight against U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism occupies Okinawa in Japan and establishes military bases all over the Japanese mainland; it will not withdraw automatically. It is entirely correct for the Japanese people to recognize such a heinous enemy, mobilize the entire people, and wage a resolute struggle against it. We resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against U.S. military bases. The Chinese and Japanese people should learn from each other, support each other, and persevere in the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end!

Chu Tunan said that Mr. Nakajima is not only an active fighter in the great anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, but also a firm and resolute organizer of Japanese cultural and art circles in participating in this struggle; at the same time, he is also an envoy of cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people, playing an active and beneficial role in strengthening the fighting friendship and cultural exchange between our two peoples. Chu Tunan said that the fighting friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people are developing day by day. He said that the Chinese and Japanese people should be friends forever.

Nakajima Kenzo said in his speech that this is his third visit to China, and he is in a particularly good mood this time because the Japanese people have achieved great victories in their anti-American patriotic and just struggle. He pointed out that the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has made the Japanese people aware of what U.S. imperialism wants to do, and all kinds of people in Japan have participated in this struggle. The number of people participating in each gathering was more than he expected. Workers, students, professors, lawyers, and people from all walks of life are engaged in a resolute struggle for a common goal. At the beginning of the struggle, they submitted petitions to the Diet, and later it developed into demonstrations. The area around the Japanese Diet became a vortex of demonstrations, with millions of people united as one. Workers and scholars encouraged and supported each other in the struggle. This has never happened before in Japanese history. He said that the Chinese people's support for the just struggle of the Japanese people has given the Japanese people great encouragement, and he represents the Japanese people in expressing his gratitude to the Chinese people.

Nakajima Kenzo finally proposed a toast to the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and to the victory of the two peoples in opposing the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

Liao Chengzhi, in his speech, called Mr. Nakajima Kenzo's visit to Beijing and the delegation led by Liu Ningyi to Tokyo "double happiness." He said that the fact that the delegation led by Liu Ningyi was able to go to Japan should be attributed to the just struggle of the Japanese people and the efforts of Mr. Nakajima Kenzo and other Japanese friends. He proposed a toast to the health of Mr. Nakajima Kenzo.

Among those attending the banquet were Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee; Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; and cultural figures from the capital, including Mei Lanfang, Lü Ji, Zhou Erfu, Ma Sicong, Xie Bingxin, Ma Shaobo, Lou Shiyi, Lin Lin, and Yang Shuo.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo, who were in Beijing, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, his wife, and their accompanying staff member, Shirato Go, arrived in Beijing by train this morning.

    日本人民反美斗争鼓舞了全世界人民
    中岛健藏说反美斗争使日本千万人结成一体
    新华社29日讯　中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏和他的夫人以及随行人员白土吾夫。
    楚图南在宴会上讲话，热烈欢迎中岛健藏先生和他的夫人的到来。他指出，日本人民二十二次波澜壮阔的反对美日军事同盟条约的全国统一行动和数次规模巨大的政治总罢工，震动了整个世界，给予全世界爱好和平的人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的斗争以极大的鼓舞。日本人民这个伟大斗争，对正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民来说，也是一个极大的支持。
    楚图南说，日本人民通过实际的斗争，认识到他们真正的敌人是美帝国主义，并且找到了同美帝国主义斗争的办法。美帝国主义霸占了日本的冲绳，在日本本土遍地建立军事基地，它是不会自动撤退的。日本人民认清这样一个穷凶极恶的敌人，动员全民，与之进行坚决的斗争，是完全正确的，我们坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美国军事基地的斗争。中日两国人民应该互相学习、互相支持，为反对美帝国主义坚持斗争到底！
    楚图南说，中岛先生在日本人民伟大的反美爱国正义斗争中，不仅是一位积极的战士，并且是日本文化艺术界人士参加这个斗争的坚定果敢的组织者；同时又是中日两国人民文化交流的使节，对于加强我们两国人民的战斗友谊和文化交流都起着积极而有益的作用。楚图南说，中国和日本人民之间的战斗友谊和文化交流日益发展。他说，中日两国人民应该永远友好。
    中岛健藏在讲话中说，他已经是第三次访问中国了，这一次到中国来他的心情特别好，因为日本人民在反美爱国的正义斗争已经获得了很大胜利。他指出，反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，使日本人民知道了美帝国主义想作些什么，日本各种各样的人都参加到这个斗争里了。参加每一次集会的人都比他预料的要多。工人、学生、教授、律师等各方面的人，都为了一个共同的目标而进行坚决的斗争。在斗争开始是向国会提请愿书，后来发展到游行示威，日本国会周围变成了游行的漩涡，千万人结成一体，工人和学者在斗争中互相鼓舞，互相支持。这在日本历史上是从来没有过的。他说，中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的支持，给日本人民以巨大的鼓舞，他代表日本人民向中国人民表示感谢。
    中岛健藏最后提议为中日两国人民友好，为两国人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义的胜利干杯。
    廖承志在致词中，把中岛健藏先生到北京和刘宁一率领的代表团到东京称为“双喜”。他说，刘宁一率领的代表团能去日本，这应该感谢日本人民的正义斗争，感谢中岛健藏先生和其他日本朋友的努力。他提议为中岛健藏先生的健康干杯。
    出席宴会的，有中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全，中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙，首都文化界人士梅兰芳、吕骥、周而复、马思聪、谢冰心、马少波、楼适夷、林林、杨朔等人。
    在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九也应邀出席了宴会。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏和夫人及随行人员白土吾夫等三人，是在今天早晨乘火车到达北京的。
