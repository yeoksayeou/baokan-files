Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 10th. In order to strengthen the front line of agricultural production and promote the high-speed development of agricultural production to meet the needs of industrial production and the entire national economy, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to conduct a labor force reorganization and screening throughout the province's rural areas, mobilizing one million people to return to production teams and strengthen field operations.

The following measures have been decided upon for the reorganization of the labor force:

	1. Immediately reorganize the labor force of commune enterprises and brigade specialized teams. In general, commune industrial and agricultural enterprises have problems such as chaotic management, low labor efficiency, and waste of labor. They should be carefully reorganized to improve management and increase labor efficiency, and resolutely reduce a portion of the labor force. The labor force drawn from production brigades by commune enterprises (including industry, transportation, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries) should not exceed 8%. Those exceeding this limit should be returned to the production teams to participate in field production.

	2. Resolutely recall the labor force that has blindly flowed into cities and state-owned industrial and mining, forestry, and reclamation enterprises.

	3. Universally reorganize the labor force of industrial and mining enterprises operated by various counties, implement fixed staffing and quotas, promote tool reforms, improve labor efficiency, and, according to the principle that the labor force drawn from communes to counties and state-owned farms and mines should not exceed 5%, resolutely return the excess labor force to the production teams to participate in field labor.

	4. Taking the commune as a unit and the original rural labor force at the time of communization as 100, the labor force should generally be allocated according to the following proportions (individual economic crop areas such as Shunde County can be adjusted accordingly): labor force engaged in grain production should account for 60%; labor force engaged in diversified operations, including economic crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries operated by communes and brigades, should account for 20%; labor force engaged in industry and transportation should account for 10%, of which the labor force transferred to industry and transportation outside the commune should account for 5%, and the labor force engaged in industry and transportation within the commune (including the commune and brigade levels) should account for 5%; labor force engaged in logistics should account for 10%.

	This is the proportion of agricultural labor force allocated throughout the year. During busy periods, more (such as around 80%) of the labor force can be concentrated on agricultural production.

	5. Rural schools should restrict the enrollment of over-aged students. Existing primary school students over the age of sixteen should be persuaded to transfer to part-time schools through full ideological mobilization, so that they can participate in agricultural labor while continuing to study culture. Students in agricultural middle schools should resolutely implement the regulation of half-day labor and half-day study. During busy farming seasons, farming holidays should be given as stipulated, so that students can participate in agricultural production. The time for full-time middle schools in various places to have farming holidays throughout the year can reach twenty days.

	6. The number of full-time cadres at the commune and brigade levels should generally be controlled at around 0.6% of the population, and at most not exceed 1%. Cadres must participate in production and lead production. All team cadres should participate in production.

	7. In the process of investigating and reorganizing the labor force, it is necessary to carry out political and ideological education well, tap labor potential, improve labor force utilization, improve labor organization, strengthen labor management, and overcome phenomena of work stoppages and waste. In particular, it is necessary to actively carry out tool reform movements, accelerate agricultural technology transformation, and earnestly improve labor productivity. Absolutely no labor time should be arbitrarily increased, nor should labor intensity be increased as a result of this.

According to the above regulations, roughly calculated for the whole province, the labor force that should be returned to the production teams is about one million several hundred thousand people.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Second Session of the Second Hubei Provincial People's Congress was held from June 25th to 30th. The meeting called on the people of the province to launch a larger-scale and more comprehensive upsurge of support for agriculture.

Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, delivered a "Work Report of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee" at the Provincial People's Congress. After outlining the profound changes that Hubei Province's industrial and agricultural production, politics, economy, science, and culture have experienced in the past year and more, and summarizing the experience of sustained great leaps forward in the past two years, he pointed out that Hubei Province's national economic plan for this year has reasonably arranged the proportions between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry according to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and rapidly developing agriculture. In order to ensure a better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward this year, he said, the people of the province must first regard agriculture as the main direction for ensuring the sustained leap forward of the national economy, realizing mobilization of the whole Party, mobilization of the whole people, unity from top to bottom, concentrating strength, accelerating the development of agriculture, comprehensively arranging the production of grain and various crops on the premise of ensuring increased grain production, and firmly grasping the key measures of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, and tool reform. Secondly, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of industry and transportation, and vigorously support agriculture. To this end, it is necessary to launch a mass movement to vigorously develop iron and steel, vigorously develop coal, and vigorously develop the forest industry with the spirit of vigorously developing iron and steel in 1959; third, to deeply carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four modernizations"; fourth, to strengthen financial, monetary, and trade work, and give full play to the logistical role in socialist construction; fifth, to strengthen the Party's leadership over science, culture, education, and health work, and vigorously carry out mass sports activities; sixth, to rectify and build rural people's communes and vigorously run urban people's communes. He emphasized that rural and urban people's communes should comprehensively grasp the ideology, production, and life of all members.

In a resolution, the meeting called on the people of the province, all departments of industry, transportation, finance and trade, science, culture and education to regard supporting agriculture as their important task, launch a larger-scale and comprehensive upsurge of support for agriculture throughout the province, and strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule.

    广东动员百万劳力增强公社生产小队
　　湖北发动各行各业更有力地支援农业
    本报广州10日电　为了加强农业生产第一线，促使农业生产的高速度发展，以适应工业生产和整个国民经济的需要，中共广东省委作出决定，要在全省农村进行一次劳动力的整顿和清理，动员一百万人回到生产小队，加强田间作业。
    对劳动力的整顿，决定采取以下几项措施：
    一、立即整顿公社企业和大队专业队的劳动力。在公社工业和农业企业上，一般都存在着管理混乱、劳动效率不高、劳动力有浪费的现象。应该认真进行整顿，改善经营管理，提高劳动效率，坚决减少一部分劳动力。公社企业（包括工、交及林、牧、副、渔等）抽调生产大队劳动力一律不能超过8％。超过的，应退回生产队去参加田间生产。
    二、坚决调回盲目流入城市及国营工矿、农林、垦殖企业的劳动力。
    三、普遍整顿一次各县经营的工矿企业的劳动力，实行定员定额，推行工具改革，提高劳动效率，并按照抽调公社劳动力到县和国营场矿不超过5％的原则，将多调的劳动力坚决退回到生产队去参加田间劳动。
    四、以公社为单位，以公社化时农村原有劳动力为100，劳动力一般应按照以下比例分配（个别经济作物区如顺德等县可作相应的调整），搞粮食生产的劳动力应占60％；搞多种经营，包括公社、大队经营的经济作物、林、牧、副、渔等的劳动力占20％；搞工业交通的劳动力占10％，其中外调的工交劳动力占5％，社内（包括公社及大队二级）工交劳动力占5％；搞后勤的劳动力占10％。
    这是全年农业劳动力投放的比例，大忙期间，可集中更多
  （如80％左右）的劳动力于农业生产。
    五、农村学校应当限制招收超龄学生。现有十六岁以上的小学超龄学生，应通过充分的思想动员，劝其转读业余学校，一边参加农业劳动，一边继续学习文化。农业中学的学生，应坚决执行半日劳动半日读书的规定。农事大忙应按规定放农忙假，使学生参加农业生产。各地全日制中学全年农忙假的时间可以达到二十天。
    六、公社、大队二级脱产干部一般应控制在占人口的0.6％左右，最多不超过1％。干部必须参加生产，领导生产。小队干部应全部参加生产。
    七、在进行清查整顿劳动力的工作中，必须很好地进行政治思想教育，挖掘劳动潜力，提高劳动力利用率，改进劳动组织，加强劳动管理，克服窝工浪费现象。尤其要积极开展工具改革运动，加速农业技术改造，认真提高劳动生产率。绝对不能因此而任意增加劳动时间，加强劳动强度。
    按照上列规定，全省粗略计算，应当归回生产小队的劳动力大约有一百几十万人。
    据新华社讯　湖北第二届人民代表大会第二次会议在6月25日到30日举行，会议号召全省人民掀起更大规模更全面支援农业的高潮。
    湖北省省长张体学在省人民代表大会会议上作了“湖北省人民委员会工作报告”。他在概述了一年多来湖北省的工农业生产、政治、经济、科学和文化等各方面所经历的深刻变化，和总结了两年来持续大跃进的经验以后指出，湖北省今年的国民经济计划，已根据以农业为基础、以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，对农业、轻工业、重工业之间的比例作了合理安排。为了确保今年更好更全面地持续跃进，他说，全省人民首先要把农业当作保证国民经济持续跃进的主攻方向，实现全党动员，全民动员，上下一心，集中力量，加速发展农业，在保证粮食增产的前提下，全面安排粮食和各类作物的生产，狠狠抓好以水肥土为中心的农业“八字宪法”和工具改革这些关键性的措施。其次是加速工业和运输业的建设，大力支援农业。为此，要以1959年大办钢铁的精神，全民动员，有领导有计划地掀起一个大办钢铁、大办煤炭、大办森林工业的群众运动；第三，深入开展以“四化”为中心的群众性技术革新、技术革命运动；第四，加强财政金融贸易工作，充分发挥在社会主义建设中的后勤作用；第五，加强党对科学文化教育和卫生工作的领导，大力开展群众性体育活动；第六，整顿和建设农村人民公社，大办城市人民公社。他着重指出，农村、城市人民公社应当把全体社员的思想、生产、生活全面地抓起来。
    会议在一项决议中，号召全省人民，工业、交通运输、财贸、科学、文教等各部门都要把支援农业当作自己的重要任务，在全省范围内掀起一个更大规模的全面支援农业的高潮，为提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。
