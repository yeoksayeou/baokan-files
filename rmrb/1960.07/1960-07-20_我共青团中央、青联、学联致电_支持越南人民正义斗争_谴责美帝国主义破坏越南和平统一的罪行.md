Xinhua News Agency, July 19th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation sent telegrams to the Vietnam Labor Youth Union, the Vietnam Youth Federation, and the Vietnam Students' Union, representing all Chinese youth and students in firmly supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Vietnamese people and youth.

    The telegram stated: Six years have passed since the signing of the Geneva Accords, but due to the U.S. imperialism's obstinate obstruction and sabotage, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not yet been realized. In order to achieve its conspiracy of permanently occupying South Vietnam and turning South Vietnam into a U.S. base of aggression, U.S. imperialism has not only illegally dispatched a large number of U.S. military personnel and smuggled weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam, but has also instructed its loyal lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, to carry out frantic fascist suppression and persecution of the patriotic people in South Vietnam. Chinese youth and students express boundless indignation and stern condemnation of the monstrous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in South Vietnam. The telegram said that the U.S.-Ngo clique's reactionary crimes of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and cruelly suppressing the patriotic people of South Vietnam can only arouse increasingly strong anger and resistance from the people of South Vietnam. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. Its bellicose and aggressive nature will never change. The Vietnamese people, youth, and students have launched a massive patriotic and just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. We Chinese youth and students will forever stand with the fraternal Vietnamese people, youth, and students, and resolutely fight to the end against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, who once defeated the French colonialists through unyielding struggle, will certainly be able to drive away U.S. imperialism through the same resolute and sustained struggle and achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

　　我共青团中央、青联、学联致电
　　支持越南人民正义斗争
　　谴责美帝国主义破坏越南和平统一的罪行
    新华社19日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会致电越南劳动青年团、越南青年联合会、越南大学生联合会，代表全中国青年和学生坚决支持越南人民和青年的爱国正义斗争。
    电文说：日内瓦协议签订到现在已经六年，但是由于美帝国主义的蛮横阻挠和破坏，越南的和平统一至今未能实现。美帝国主义为了达到它永远霸占越南南方，并且把越南南方变成美国侵略基地的阴谋，不仅非法地派遣大批美国军事人员和偷运武器弹药到越南南方，而且还指使其忠实走狗吴庭艳集团对越南南方爱国人民进行疯狂的法西斯镇压和迫害。中国青年和学生对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团在越南南方所犯下的滔天罪行表示无比的愤慨和严正的谴责。电文说，美吴集团扩军备战和残酷镇压越南南方爱国人民的反动罪行，只能激起越南南方人民日益强烈的愤怒和反抗。美帝国主义是越南人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的死敌，它的好战的侵略本性是永远不会改变的。越南人民和青年学生为了反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团已掀起了声势浩大的爱国正义斗争。我们中国青年和学生将永远和兄弟的越南人民和青年学生站在一起，为反对我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义而坚决斗争到底。我们深信，曾经以不屈不挠的斗争战胜法国殖民者的越南人民，也一定能够以同样坚决、持久的斗争赶走美帝国主义，实现祖国的和平统一。
