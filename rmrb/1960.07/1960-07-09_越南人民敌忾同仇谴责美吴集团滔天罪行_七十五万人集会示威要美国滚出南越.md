Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: According to reports in local newspapers today, the movement of the people of North Vietnam against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem group is unfolding with great momentum.

According to incomplete statistics, from June 30th to July 5th, nearly 750,000 people in various parts of North Vietnam have held rallies and demonstrations against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group.

During this period, people from all walks of life who participated in the rallies and demonstrations against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group wrote more than 3,000 protest letters to the International Commission for Vietnam, strongly condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Ngo Dinh Diem, in South Vietnam. They also demanded that the International Commission re-examine its erroneous conclusions regarding the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and Ngo Dinh Diem's Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, and demanded that the U.S. aggressors get out of South Vietnam.

In many places, the people have transformed grief and indignation into strength, launching new labor emulation drives and holding "anti-American labor days."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: The "People's Daily" of Vietnam today published a commentary strongly condemning the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group over the past six years. The commentary stated: The running dogs of U.S. imperialism, the traitorous Ngo Dinh Diem group, are recently staging a so-called commemoration of Ngo Dinh Diem's "six years in power" in South Vietnam. The commentary said that Ngo Dinh Diem's "six years in power" are also six years of being a running dog for U.S. imperialism and committing heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people.

The commentary pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem has been praised by his U.S. masters for his "dog-and-horse service." U.S. imperialism has unreservedly said, "Supporting Ngo Dinh Diem is for the benefit of the United States."

The commentary revealed that Ngo Dinh Diem has painstakingly turned South Vietnam into a U.S. military base in Southeast Asia in recent years, and is increasingly blatantly colluding with the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" completely controls all the real power of Ngo Dinh Diem's army, and the United States has also established a system of military bases in South Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem group, relying on U.S. aid, has vociferously clamored for "marching north," sending troops to invade Cambodian territory, and helping the United States and its Lao running dogs suppress the patriotic movement of the Lao people. The U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group is turning South Vietnam into a powder keg for launching wars.

The commentary pointed out that in the economic field, while the United States is dumping surplus goods in South Vietnam through "U.S. aid," it is also establishing a large number of companies or so-called "joint ventures" in South Vietnam. The result of Ngo Dinh Diem's group's open-door policy towards U.S. capital is that South Vietnam's economy is at a dead end and dependent on the United States. The Ngo Dinh Diem group also uses the pretext of importing a large amount of "surplus grain" from the United States to force South Vietnamese farmers to convert rice fields into economic crops. The so-called "agrovilles" are precisely the places where they have converted rice fields into economic crops.

The commentary then exposed the crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem group in suppressing the people and implementing fascist rule in South Vietnam for the past six years. The commentary pointed out that the crimes committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem group against the people of South Vietnam in the past few years are truly countless. But the more crimes they commit, the deeper the people's hatred for them, and the sooner the graves prepared for them will be dug.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: Religious figures from Buddhism, Catholicism, Cao Đài, Christianity and other religions in Hanoi held a rally on the evening of the 6th, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations, and opposing the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group in persecuting the people of South Vietnam, especially the patriotic religious people of South Vietnam.

This is one of many rallies in the recent movement of people in various parts of North Vietnam against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem group.

The representative of the Hanoi Fatherland Front pointed out in his speech at the meeting that U.S. imperialism, like a plague god, is driven away wherever it goes. He exposed the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group in turning South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony, turning South Vietnamese Catholic churches into bunkers, and destroying temples everywhere and persecuting patriotic religious people.

The people participating in the meeting shouted angrily from time to time: "Down with the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group!" "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam!" and other slogans.

The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" get out of South Vietnam, opposing the persecution of patriotic people and religious believers in South Vietnam, and expressing firm support for Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on June 26.

More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Vinh Phuc City and Ha Giang City also held rallies and demonstrations on the 4th and 5th, opposing U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem group. The people of Vinh Phuc City also launched a "drought prevention, production, anti-U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group, strive for a bumper late rice harvest" movement to support the patriotic and just struggle of the compatriots in South Vietnam with practical actions.

    越南人民敌忾同仇谴责美吴集团滔天罪行
    七十五万人集会示威要美国滚出南越
    新华社河内7日电　据此间报纸今天报道，越南北方人民反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的斗争运动正在波澜壮阔地展开。
    据不完全统计，从6月30日起到7月5日止，越南北方各地已有近七十五万人举行了反对美国—吴庭艳集团的集会和游行示威。
    在这期间，参加反对美国—吴庭艳集团集会和示威的各阶层人民曾经写了三千多封抗议书给越南国际委员会，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳在南越犯下的滔天罪行，并且要求国际委员会重新审查它对“美国军事援助顾问团”和吴庭艳的1959年第十号法令所作出的错误结论，同时要求美国侵略者滚出南越。
    许多地方的人民还把悲愤化为力量，发动新的劳动竞赛和举行“反美劳动日”。
    新华社河内7日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论强烈谴责美国—吴庭艳集团六年来的罪行。评论说：美帝国主义的走狗、卖国贼吴庭艳集团最近正在南越大搞所谓纪念吴庭艳“执政”六周年的把戏。评论说，吴庭艳“执政”的六年，也就是给美帝国主义当走狗、对越南人民犯下滔天罪行的六年。
    评论指出，吴庭艳以其“犬马之劳”受到美国主子的赞赏。美帝国主义曾经毫不隐讳地说，“扶植吴庭艳是为了美国的利益。”
    评论揭露吴庭艳几年来，煞费苦心地把南越变成美国在东南亚的军事基地，越来越明目张胆地同东南亚军事侵略集团勾结，“美国军事援助顾问团”完全把持了吴庭艳军队的一切实权，美国并且在南越建立了军事基地体系。吴庭艳集团则依靠美国的援助而大肆叫嚷“北进”、出兵侵犯柬埔寨领土、帮助美国及其老挝走狗镇压老挝人民的爱国运动。美吴集团正在把南越变成发动战争的火药库。
    评论指出，在经济方面，美国在通过“美援”在南越倾销剩余物资的同时，还在南越建立大批公司或所谓“合股经营”企业。吴庭艳集团对美国资本实行门户开放政策的结果，使南越经济走头无路和依附美国。吴庭艳集团还以可以从美国输入大量“余粮”为借口，而迫使南越农民把稻田改种经济作物。所谓“稠密区”正是它们把稻田改种经济作物的地方。
    评论接着还揭露了吴庭艳集团六年来在南越大肆镇压人民，实行法西斯统治的罪行。评论指出，过去几年中，吴庭艳集团对南越人民犯下的罪行，真是罄竹难书。但是他们的罪行越多，人民对他们的仇恨就越深，为他们准备的坟墓也就挖得越早。
    新华社河内6日电　河内佛教、天主教、高台教、基督教等宗教界人士一千四百人在6日晚举行大会，强烈谴责美帝国主义扩军备战活动，反对美国—吴庭艳集团迫害南越人民、特别是迫害南越爱国教民的滔天罪行。
    这是最近几天来越南北方各地人民反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团运动中许多集会中的一个。
    河内祖国战线的代表在大会上讲话指出，美帝国主义像瘟神一样，所到之处，人人驱赶。他揭露了美吴集团把南越变成美国军事基地和殖民地，把南越的天主教堂变成碉堡以及到处拆毁寺庙、迫害爱国教民的罪行。
    参加大会的人不时愤怒地高呼：“打倒美吴集团！”“美帝国主义从南越滚出去！”等口号。
    大会通过决议，要求“美国军事援助顾问团”从南越滚出去，反对迫害南越爱国人民和南越宗教徒，并且表示坚决支持范文同外交部长6月26日写给日内瓦会议两主席的信。
    永福市、河江市各界人民五千多人在4日、5日也曾经举行大会和示威游行，反对美帝国主义和它的走狗吴庭艳集团。永福市人民还展开“防旱、生产，反美吴集团，争取晚造丰收”运动，以实际行动支援南越同胞的爱国正义斗争。（附图片）
