Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 4th: Tunisian sources report: The Tunisian newspaper "Le Matin" condemned the behind-the-scenes conspiracy of American imperialism in the French-Algerian preliminary negotiations. The newspaper pointed out that the rulers of Washington are looking for excuses for De Gaulle and want Algerian nationalists to accept all the conditions put forward by De Gaulle.

The newspaper pointed out that the rulers of Washington have forgotten that what the Algerian people have sacrificed a million lives for is much more precious than the profits of Paris and Washington.

Another Tunisian newspaper, "L'Action," said that because the French government insists on colonialist principles, it is more difficult than ever to say that France's attitude towards resolving the Algerian issue is justified.

Referring to the right of self-determination, "L'Action" said that the true principle of self-determination must be a free referendum with all necessary guarantees, and all strata of the Algerian people should participate in the referendum without any pressure. The newspaper said that the Algerian National Liberation Front cannot agree to a ceasefire without all the necessary guarantees of a free referendum.

    突尼斯报纸揭露华盛顿的帮凶嘴脸
    美国企图迫使阿尔及利亚接受屈辱条件
    新华社拉巴特4日电　突尼斯消息：突尼斯“晨报”谴责美帝国主义在法国和阿尔及利亚预备谈判的幕后进行阴谋活动。这家报纸指出，华盛顿的统治者为戴高乐寻找借口，并且要阿尔及利亚民族主义者接受戴高乐提出的一切条件。
    这家报纸指出，华盛顿的统治者忘记了，阿尔及利亚人民牺牲了一百万生命而争取的东西，比巴黎和华盛顿的利润要珍贵得多。
    另一家突尼斯报纸“行动报”说，法国政府坚持殖民主义原则，所以比过去任何时候都更难说法国在解决阿尔及利亚问题上采取的态度是正当的。
    “行动报”在谈到自决权时说，真正的自决原则必须是包括一切必要保证的自由的公民投票，阿尔及利亚人民的各个阶层都应该在排除一切压力的情况下参加公民投票。这家报纸说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线在没有得到自由的公民投票的一切必要的保证以前是不能同意停火的。
