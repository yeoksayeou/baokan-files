Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 2nd: Since its establishment on October 1, 1958, the Siping City People's Commune in Jilin Province has fully utilized the immense advantages of the commune to conduct extensive city-wide collaboration, thereby ensuring the high-speed development of various production endeavors.

The Siping People's Commune currently has a population of 210,000 and is a small heavy industrial city centered on mechanical and chemical industries. Workers and their families number 153,000, accounting for 72% of the total commune population. In 1958, after achieving victory in the rectification campaign and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, and inspired by the rural people's communization movement and the enthusiastic demands of the broad masses of workers, the local CPC Committee led the people of Siping City to establish the Siping People's Commune, a "one city, one commune" structure, on October 1, 1958.

After the establishment of the Siping People's Commune, it took production as the central task and launched a new high tide in developing production and undertaking collective welfare projects. Within just one month of the commune's establishment, over 13,000 street residents (of whom over 80% were housewives) were organized to participate in social production. Currently, the number of public canteens has increased from 196 before the establishment of the commune to 410 by the end of May, with over 95,000 people participating in the canteens. 694 nurseries and kindergartens have been established, accommodating over 13,000 children. Over the past year, the number of people participating in production has continued to increase to 21,000, and collective welfare undertakings have also been rectified and consolidated. Various production sectors have seen significant development. In 1959, the total output value of state-owned industries increased by 37.1% compared to 1958, and the national plans for 36 major products were overfulfilled. Commune-run industries have developed to 354 factories, producing 610 types of products, with a significant increase in total output value last year compared to 1958. The production of all 18 agricultural production brigades in the commune has also seen significant development, with an average increase of 37.23% in yield per unit area last year compared to 1958, and a more than twofold increase in total vegetable production. Commerce, culture, education, and health undertakings have also seen significant development.

After the establishment of the Siping People's Commune, it fully mobilized the positive factors and various potentials of all sectors, ensuring the sustained leap forward in various productions, especially guaranteeing the early and over-fulfillment of key national tasks and shock tasks. At the beginning of 1959, Siping faced heavy production tasks with tight deadlines, and most of the products had never been produced before, with insufficient man-hours and raw materials. If production were to be carried out according to the original division of labor among enterprises, it would obviously be impossible to complete the tasks on time. However, under the unified leadership of the commune's Party Committee, over 12,000 workers from 22 units across the commune were organized to participate, and all sectors of the city, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military, provided manpower and material support, cooperated in the division of labor, and jointly broke through the key problems. As a result, all key equipment manufacturing tasks were completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

The commune also used the method of large-scale collaboration to carry out technological transformations of existing enterprises. For example, the vegetable oil workshop of the Siping City Oil and Wine Factory, where industrial model worker Li Chuanjiang worked, underwent a thorough technological transformation last year, changing from manual screw press oil extraction to leaching oil extraction, which can increase the national edible oil production by a minimum of 1.68 million catties per year, while reducing the number of employees by nearly 80%. In order to realize this transformation project as soon as possible, 37 units across the commune collaborated with them, completely solving the problems of raw materials and technical strength that the Oil and Wine Factory itself could not solve, and completed and put into production seven months ahead of the original plan (one and a half years). Currently, this workshop processes 240,000 catties of soybeans per day, a threefold increase compared to the past, and the oil yield rate has increased from 77.94% to 92.52%. The workers' working conditions have also been greatly improved, and the labor intensity has been significantly reduced. Over the past year, the commune has completed or partially completed the new construction, expansion, and technological transformation tasks of factories such as the vegetable oil workshop of the Oil and Wine Factory, the Line Equipment Factory, the Siping Steel Factory, the Cotton Textile Factory, and the United Chemical Factory through comprehensive large-scale collaboration. The commune also launched a mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement, further ensuring the completion of production tasks.

Currently, the commune-run industries in Siping Commune have seen significant development. Commune-run industries include 23 industries such as smelting, machinery, agricultural tool repair and manufacturing, rubber, building materials, daily necessities, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, sewing, grain, and food processing, with a total of 7,190 employees, including over 990 technical workers. The degree of mechanization in commune-run industries has also been greatly improved compared to the past. According to the commune's policy of guaranteeing large-scale industrial production as the main goal, commune-run industries actively serve large factories and have become a powerful assistant to large factories. Commune-run industries also use their flexible production characteristics to meet the urgent needs of large factories at any time.

The Siping People's Commune also carried out large-scale collaboration between urban and rural areas, greatly promoting the development and technological transformation of suburban agricultural production, and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Over the past year, the industrial and commercial departments of the commune have provided a total of 72 types and over 230,000 pieces of machinery and agricultural tools for spring plowing, summer hoeing, autumn harvesting, transportation, and water conservancy to various production brigades. They have also supported the production brigades in establishing 64 small factories for agricultural tools, rice milling, etc., by helping to train technical workers and other methods. Currently, the degree of semi-mechanization, mechanization, and electrification of various productions in the suburbs has been greatly improved. In addition, various departments in the city have sent 250,000 person-times to support suburban agricultural production. Last autumn, the commune also mobilized a large amount of manpower to complete tasks such as collecting and storing autumn vegetables and picking mountain products, completely changing the past situation of relying heavily on foreign aid for vegetables. This year, the agricultural production teams of the commune have expanded the cultivated land area by more than 1,000 hectares, and the vegetable planting area has also increased significantly. The commune mobilized 5,000 to 6,000 employees and street residents from various departments in the city to rush to support summer hoeing in the suburbs, ensuring that no acre of land was left uncultivated by the agricultural production teams.

Thanks to fully utilizing the advantages of the commune and vigorously developing production and collective welfare undertakings, the living standards of the broad masses of commune members have greatly improved. According to statistics, the average monthly wage of the more than 20,000 family members and residents who were employed after the establishment of the commune is more than 24 yuan, and the social purchasing power and bank savings of the entire commune have greatly increased. In 1959, the social purchasing power increased by 26% compared to 1958, and bank savings increased by 1 million yuan, an increase of 143%. The cultural and educational undertakings of this commune and the cultural life of the commune members have also been greatly developed and improved. The entire commune has initially established an educational system from primary school to university. Primary school education has been popularized, and the development of ordinary middle schools, literacy campaigns, and spare-time education is also very rapid. Mass scientific and technological research and the study of Chairman Mao's works have also been widely carried out.

The socialist consciousness and collectivist ideology of the broad masses of commune members in Siping Commune have been continuously improved. In particular, the thousands of housewives who were liberated from household chores after the establishment of the commune are full of enthusiasm and have become a vital force in various departments of the commune. With the increasing awareness of the employees, a group of Party members and Communist Youth League members has been developed in the commune-run factories, establishing 23 Party branches and 24 Communist Youth League branches, and 664 employees have been recognized as advanced producers. The employees of large factories have also shown a noble style in the large-scale collaboration across the commune. In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, hundreds and thousands of employees have also actively helped commune-run industries and other departments to make innovations.

    四平公社开展全市范围大协作
    工业农业和集体生活福利事业获得高速度发展
    据新华社长春2日电　吉林省四平市人民公社，从1958年10月1日诞生以来，充分运用公社的巨大优越性，深入开展了全市范围的大协作，从而保证了各项生产事业的高速度发展。
    四平人民公社现有二十一万人口，是一座以机械工业和化学工业为中心的小型重工业城市，居民中职工和职工家属有十五万三千人，占全社人口的72％。1958年，四平人民在整风取得胜利和党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在农村人民公社化的鼓舞和广大职工群众的积极要求下，当地的中共党委就领导四平市人民在1958年10月1日建立了一市一社的四平人民公社。
    四平人民公社建立以后，以生产为中心，掀起了发展生产和大办集体福利事业的新高潮。仅在建社后的一个月内，全社就组织了一万三千多名街道居民（其中家庭妇女占80％以上）参加了社会生产。目前，公共食堂已由建社前的一百九十六个增加到5月底的四百一十个，参加食堂的人数达到九万五千多人；办起托儿所和幼儿园六百九十四个，入托入园儿童一万三千多名。一年多来，参加生产人数继续增加到二万一千人，集体福利事业也进行了整顿和巩固。各项生产有了很大发展，1959年国营工业总产值比1958年增长37.1％，三十六种主要产品都超额完成了国家计划。社办工业已经发展到三百五十四个工厂，生产六百一十种产品，去年的总产值比1958年有了很大增长。全社十八个农业生产大队的生产也有很大发展，去年平均单位面积产量比1958年增长37.23％，蔬菜总产量增长两倍以上。商业和文教卫生等事业也有很大发展。
    四平人民公社建立以后，充分调动各方面的积极因素和各种潜力，保证了各项生产的持续跃进，特别是保证了国家重点任务和突击任务的提前和超额完成。1959年初，四平的生产任务繁重，时间又紧，绝大部分产品以前又没有生产过，工时和原材料都不够。如果按照原有的企业分工进行生产，显然不能按时完成任务。但是在公社党委统一领导下，组织全社二十二个单位共一万二千多名职工参加，全市工、农、商、学、兵等各界支援了人力和物力，分工合作，共同突破关键。结果，全部重点设备的制造任务都提前并超额完成。
    全社通过大协作的方法，还对现有企业进行技术改造。例如工业劳动模范李川江所在的四平市油酒厂植物油车间去年进行了彻底的技术改造，把由人力推动螺旋机榨油变为浸出制油，每年最低可以为国家增产食油一百六十八万斤，职工人数却减少近80％。为了早日实现这项改造工程，全社有三十七个单位和他们进行协作，使油酒厂本身无法解决的原材料和技术力量等问题完全得到了解决，而且比原定计划（一年半）提前七个月完工并投入生产。现在这个车间日处理大豆二十四万斤，比过去提高三倍，出油率由77.94％提高到92.52％，工人的劳动条件也大大改善，劳动强度显著减轻。一年多来，全社通过全面大协作的方法，先后完成或部分完成了油酒厂植物油车间、线路器材厂、四平钢厂、棉纺厂、联合化工厂等工厂的新建、扩建和技术改造任务，全社同时还开展了全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，进一步保证了生产任务的完成。
    目前，四平公社的社办工业有了很大发展，社办工业包括冶炼、机械、农具修造、橡胶、建筑材料、日用百货、化肥、农药、缝纫、粮食和食品加工等二十三个行业，共有七千一百九十多名职工，其中技术工人有九百九十多名。社办工业的机械化程度也比过去大大提高。根据全社以保证大工业生产为主要奋斗目标的方针，社办工业积极为大工厂服务，成为大工厂的有力助手。社办工业还利用它生产灵活的特点，随时满足大工厂的紧急需要。
    四平人民公社也在城乡之间开展了大协作，大大促进了郊区农业生产的发展和技术改造，进一步巩固了工农联盟。公社的工业和商业部门一年来共为各生产大队提供春耕、夏锄、秋收、运输和水利等各种机械、农具共七十二种、二十三万多件；并且通过帮助培养技术工人等办法支持各生产大队办起了六十四个农具、碾米等小型工厂。目前郊区各项生产的半机械化、机械化和电气化程度已经有很大提高。此外，市内各部门还出动二十五万人次支援郊区农业生产。去年秋天，公社还动员大量人力，完成了收储秋菜和采摘山货等任务。彻底改变了过去蔬菜大量依靠外援的状况。今年公社各农业生产队扩大了耕地面积一千多公顷，蔬菜种植面积又有很大增加。公社就动员市内各部门职工和街道居民五、六千人，突击支援郊区夏锄，保证各农业生产队不荒一亩地。
    四平人民公社由于充分运用公社的优越性，大力发展生产和集体生活福利事业，广大社员的生活水平已有很大提高。据统计，公社成立以后就业的二万多名家属和居民，平均每人月工资是二十四元多，全社的社会购买力和银行储蓄额有了很大增长。1959年的社会购买力比1958年提高26％，银行储蓄额增加一百万元，提高143％。这个公社的文化教育事业和社员的文化生活也有较大的发展和提高。全社已初步建立起由小学到大学的教育体系，小学教育已经得到普及，普通中学、扫盲和业余教育发展也很快，群众性的科学技术研究和毛主席著作的学习，也已广泛地开展起来。
    四平公社广大社员的社会主义觉悟和集体主义思想不断提高，特别是公社成立后从家务琐事中解放出来的成千上万的家庭妇女，更是干劲冲天，成为公社各部门的一支生力军。随着职工觉悟的日益提高，在社办工厂中已经发展了一批党员、团员，建立起二十三个党支部和二十四个团支部，并有六百六十四名职工被评为先进生产者。大工厂的职工在全社的大协作中，也表现出高尚的风格。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，还有成百上千的职工主动地帮助社办工业和其他部门闹革新。（附图片）
