Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 1st: A vigorous campaign to "Learn from Shen Zhaoyun and Catch up with Shen Zhaoyun" has been launched in Qinghai Province. Cadres at all levels are going to backward teams, poor teams, and the most difficult places to work, immersing themselves in the front lines of production. They eat, live, labor, and consult with the masses, focusing on backward units and weak links, and promoting the rapid catching up of a number of backward teams with advanced teams.

Shen Zhaoyun was originally the Party Branch Secretary of the Xiguan Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Datong County, Qinghai. In February of this year, he responded to the Party's call, displayed the communist spirit of "taking on difficulties," and "settled" in the backward Dongguan First Team from the advanced Xiguan Production Team, serving as the Party Branch Secretary of the Dongguan First Team. In his new post, he paid attention to the role of the Party branch as a fortress, led by example, educated cadres and Party members to participate in labor, cared about the masses' thoughts, production, and life, and extensively mobilized and relied on the masses, enabling the Dongguan First Team to leap to become an advanced production team in a short period of time. Shen Zhaoyun's exemplary behavior has been valued by the Party. The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to the Party committees of all prefectures, cities, and counties in April, deciding to launch a campaign to "Learn from Shen Zhaoyun and Catch up with Shen Zhaoyun" among all Party members and cadres, calling on Party members and cadres to go to backward teams, poor teams, and the most difficult places to work, and to help backward teams and poor teams quickly catch up with advanced teams and rich teams.

Now, from agricultural areas to pastoral areas, a large-scale campaign to "Learn from Shen Zhaoyun and Catch up with Shen Zhaoyun" has been launched. More than 70% of the cadres in various prefectures, counties, and communes have packed their bags and gone to the front lines. Thousands upon thousands of cadres at all levels have gone to backward teams and poor teams to "settle down." With the help of these cadres, many backward units have caught up. In Datong County, where Shen Zhaoyun is located, more than 50 county-level and commune-level leading cadres and Party branch secretaries of advanced production teams have "settled" in backward teams. After strengthening their work, three of the four backward teams in the Qingshan Commune of this county have reached the level of advanced production teams. In the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, more than 400 outstanding cadres have been assigned to backward teams and poor teams as Party branch secretaries, team leaders, or resident helpers, enabling most of the backward teams to catch up with the advanced teams in field management. The Golmud People's Commune in the Qaidam Basin is a commune that is mainly engaged in animal husbandry and combines agriculture and animal husbandry. In the past, due to the rule of feudal herdbowners, the foundation of production and work was relatively weak. In April of this year, the Golmud Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee. The First Secretary, Gao Zhenshan, and the secretaries of the Secretariat, Wang Yuzhong and Gacairen (Mongolian), personally led a work team to settle in this commune. Gao Zhenshan also concurrently served as the secretary of the commune's Party committee. The original three Party committee secretaries and four commune chiefs of the commune also served as secretaries or team leaders in backward teams, comprehensively strengthening the leadership of backward teams. Now the agricultural and animal husbandry production of this commune has caught up with the level of advanced communes.

Thousands upon thousands of cadres who work in backward teams and poor teams take Shen Zhaoyun as an example and promote the spirit of hard work and simplicity. They go deep into the fields and herds, appear wherever there are difficulties, and focus on whichever link is weak. They eat, live, and work with the commune members, constantly caring about the masses' thoughts, production, and life, and consulting with the masses on everything, thereby further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. Ga Cairen, the Secretary of the Golmud Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, often worked with commune members after "settling" in the Hongxing Production Team of the Golmud Commune. Once, in order to help commune members move tents, he carried heavy furniture across a river more than one meter deep more than a dozen times until the tents were moved. This greatly moved the commune members, who expressed that "we must develop production better to repay the Party's care."

The movement of Party members and cadres throughout the province to learn from Shen Zhaoyun has also encouraged Shen Zhaoyun to continue to promote the spirit of hard work and simplicity and to do a better job in the Dongguan First Team. In the field management campaign of spring wheat crops with high yield as the key, he personally carried out an experiment to transform the third-class seedlings on a 19-mu (approx. 3 acres) plot of land, so that the original yellow and weak third-class field quickly became a strong and green first-class field, becoming a model for the third-class fields to catch up with the first-class fields. Under his leadership, the production of this team has always been at the forefront of the entire commune. Recently, under the guidance of the thought of continuous revolution, Shen Zhaoyun has formulated a new work plan and is preparing to go to another backward team, the Dongguan Second Team, to help it quickly catch up with the advanced team.

    深入到最困难的地方去　深入到生产第一线去
    青海广大干部掀起学习沈兆云运动
    据新华社西宁1日电　青海省掀起了轰轰烈烈的“学沈兆云、赶沈兆云”的运动，各级干部纷纷到后进队、穷队和最困难的地方去工作，深入生产第一线，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，狠抓后进单位和薄弱环节，促使一批后进队迅速赶上了先进队。
    沈兆云原是青海大通县城关人民公社西关生产队的党支部书记，今年2月，他响应党的号召，发扬了“见困难就上”的共产主义风格，从先进的西关生产队到后进的东关一队“落户”，担任东关一队的党支部书记。他在新的工作岗位上注意发挥党支部的堡垒作用，以身作则教育干部和党员参加劳动，关心群众的思想、生产和生活，并且广泛发动和依靠群众，使东关一队在短期内一跃而为先进生产队。沈兆云的模范行为，受到了党的重视。中共青海省委在4月间给各州、市、县委发出指示，确定在全体党员和干部中开展“学沈兆云、赶沈兆云”的运动，号召党员和干部到后进队去、到穷队去、到最困难的地方去工作，帮助后进队和穷队迅速赶上先进队和富队。
    现在，从农业区到牧业区，一个声势浩大的“学沈兆云、赶沈兆云”的运动已经开展起来。各州、县、公社70％以上的干部背起行装，纷纷深入第一线；成千成万的各级干部到后进队、穷队去“落户”，许多后进单位在这些干部帮助下已经赶了上来。沈兆云所在的大通县，有五十多名县级和公社领导干部、先进生产队的支部书记到后进队
  “落户”；这个县青山公社的四个后进队加强工作后，已经有三个达到先进生产队的水平。互助土族自治县也有四百多名优秀干部分别到后进队和穷队担任党支部书记、队长或者驻点帮助工作，使大部分后进队的田间管理工作赶上了先进队的水平。柴达木地区格尔木人民公社是一个以牧为主、农牧结合的公社，过去由于封建牧主的统治，生产和工作基础都比较薄弱。今年4月，中共格尔木市委响应省委号召，第一书记高振山，书记处书记王玉忠、尕才仁（蒙古族）亲自带领工作组到这个社落户；高振山并且兼任公社党委书记的职务。原来公社的三位党委书记和四位社长，也分别到后进队兼任书记或队长，全面加强了后进队的领导力量。现在这个公社的农牧业生产已经赶上先进社的水平。
    成千上万到后进队和穷队工作的干部，都以沈兆云为榜样，发扬艰苦朴素的工作作风。他们深入田间、畜群，哪里有困难就出现在哪里，哪个环节薄弱就抓哪个环节；他们和社员同吃同住同劳动，时刻关心群众的思想、生产和生活，凡事同群众商量，因而进一步调动了群众的积极性。中共格尔木市委书记尕才仁，到格尔木公社红星生产队“落户”后，经常同社员一起劳动，有一次为了帮助社员搬帐篷，他在一米来深的河水里背着沉重的家具涉水渡河十多次，直到帐篷搬完。这件事大大感动了社员，他们表示“一定要更好地发展生产，报答党的关怀。”
    全省党员和干部学习沈兆云的运动，也鼓舞了沈兆云继续发扬艰苦朴素的工作作风，把东关一队工作搞得更好。他在以丰产方为纲的春小麦作物的田间管理运动中，亲自在一块十九亩的土地上进行改造三类苗的试验，使这块原来苗黄苗弱的三类田迅速变成苗壮苗绿的一类田，成为三类田赶一类田的榜样。在他的领导下，这个队的生产一直走在全社的最前面。最近，沈兆云在不断革命的思想指导下，订出了新的工作计划，准备到另一个后进队——东关二队去，帮助它迅速赶上先进队。（附图片）
