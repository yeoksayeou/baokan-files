    The Birth of the "408" Automatic Line
    By Our Correspondents Liu Yaoli and Ao Likui

    In late June, we saw at the Shizitang Mine in Qiyang County, Hunan Province, an automatic coal loading and unloading transportation line that does not require general power or human operation. This small coal mine, with only four hundred workers and two pairs of coal shafts, has installed five such automatic lines, replacing the heavy physical labor of one hundred and five workers.

    This automatic line is more than ten feet high and has a two-layer wooden frame, equipped with screening equipment and coal loading hoppers. Under the wooden frame, there are two wooden tracks covered with sheet metal with a ten-degree slope. Two mine cars run up and down the tracks, transporting coal to the designated location. The automatic line operates in a very interesting way. It does not require any other power or human operation, relying entirely on the force generated by a loaded mine car sliding down to drive all aspects of the automatic line. When working, a mine car full of coal slides down the track, and an empty mine car climbs up. When the light mine car reaches below the hopper, the hopper automatically opens, and the screened coal flows into the mine car. Upon reaching a certain weight, the hopper automatically closes. The hopper loads coal with great precision, ensuring “not an ounce more, not an ounce less.” As the heavy coal car begins to slide down, the original heavy coal car has already automatically unloaded its coal below and is climbing back up. Its bottom plate is still open. The heavy coal car above slides down, and it is dragged up. When approaching the hopper, the bottom plate automatically closes again and fills with coal under the hopper... This cycle continues endlessly, requiring no one to attend to it. A counter reports to people how much coal this automatic transportation line transports each day.

    This automatic transportation line was created by the mine manager and two workers of this coal mine. Because almost every part had undergone dozens or hundreds of tests, and it was not successful until the four hundred and eighth time, people named this automated device the "408" unmanned and unpowered (referring to no additional power required) automatic loading and unloading transportation line.

    The birth of this automatic line has undergone many twists and turns.

    Knowing the Difficulties and Advancing
    The Shizitang Coal Mine was developed from small coal kilns during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In early February of this year, this mine was still a small coal kiln. With the development of technological innovation underground, ground loading, unloading, and transportation became a weak link hindering production. The manpower for ground loading, unloading, and transportation accounted for 43% of the total number of workers in the mine, and they could only produce ninety tons of coal and 5.6 tons of coke per day, always failing to complete the production tasks set by the county.

    How to change this situation? Tang Yongyang, the party branch secretary of the mine, and Li Ping, the mine manager, had been thinking about solutions. They visited the Qiyang Coal Mine's integrated production line, which was created using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and found a way to ensure the sustained leap forward in production. However, their mine's equipment and material conditions were worse than those of the Qiyang Coal Mine. Should they maintain the status quo, or should they know the difficulties and advance to change the status quo? This question was sharply posed to them. They thought of the situation within the mine and also remembered what County Party Secretary He Tianxiang had said in a report, which left a deep impression: "Knowing the difficulties and advancing is the true color of a hero. Only we Communists can achieve the best results under the most difficult conditions." After discussing, the two decided to use indigenous methods to create an unmanned and unpowered automatic transportation line, which must be a big step higher than the combination of indigenous and foreign machinery at the Qiyang Coal Mine. The party branch decided that Li Ping would be specifically responsible for this work.

    When the party branch put forward this task, it was actively supported by the vast majority of workers. However, it was also opposed by some people with conservative ideas. They said, "Indigenous methods can only get you started, how can they take you to the sky!" Some said: Even foreign machines need electricity to drive them, and even with electricity, you have to press a button! Never in ancient or modern times has anyone seen automation that does not use foreign machines and electricity as power. The debate between indigenous and foreign methods became the center of public opinion at that time.

    Is there automation in the world that does not use foreign machines? This was indeed a difficult problem. Li Ping was troubled by this issue. He thought: Without any basis for not using foreign machines and electricity for automation, how can we convince the masses and strengthen their confidence? In those days, he kept thinking about this question. One day, he suddenly got inspiration from the breeze outside the window and the small act of pouring boiling water from a thermos into a teacup: "It is possible to obtain power without foreign machines; this exists in nature. Wind power and water power are examples. Isn't this the theoretical basis for achieving automation with indigenous methods?"

    Having found this direction, how to use this power? He also thought of the situation in the mine where coal was lifted from underground using a winch. He thought: If, according to the slope of the mountain, we made two parallel indigenous railways, put two mine cars on the railways, and connected them with two long ropes, set up a coal loading platform at a high place, and installed a movable large disc under the platform, with the long ropes passing through the disc, using the principle of heavy driving light, wouldn't this form an automatic transportation line?

    Thus, the prototype of today's 408 automatic line first appeared in his mind. He was extremely excited. He immediately found carpenter Yuan Hongfa and electrician Huang Lewen, who had worked with him on innovation in the past, and discussed how to use these principles to refute the argument that automation could not be achieved with indigenous methods. At the debate the next day, they presented these powerful bases, victoriously ending the debate between indigenous and foreign methods.

    Creation is Overcoming Difficulties
    "If you want automation, you have to be covered in foreign equipment, with wires connected to wires, instruments plugged into machines, speak a word, and the machine starts!" This popular rhyme here at the time, although it expressed some people's sense of mystery about automation, to a certain extent, it also more vividly illustrated the complexity of automation. Especially for mine manager Li Ping, who had only completed one term of junior high school, carpenter Yuan Hongfa, who had studied old books for half a year, and electrician Huang Lewen, who had "switched careers" from being a handyman and had three and a half years of schooling, it was indeed difficult to create an unmanned and unpowered automatic loading and unloading transportation line using indigenous methods and waste materials.

    Almost every part became a critical problem. But what they thought of was how to respond to the Party's call to quickly transport coal out to support the steel industry. It was because of this strong will that one difficulty after another was finally conquered by them.

    In the beginning, in designing the stopping problem, they experimented with methods such as using a single-car brake, using iron hooks to catch the front wheels, and nailing rubber to the track at the stopping point to reduce friction. After one hundred and sixty-four times, none of them were successful.

    "Is there really no way? Can the ideal of automatic stopping not be realized?" Just as the three of them were extremely anxious, some people with conservative ideas came out again with a "sympathetic" tone and said: "Your enthusiasm is indeed admirable, and your idea of innovating for the mine is also worth learning, but you must know that if automation could really be achieved with indigenous methods and tools, large cities and large factories would have already done it. Why bother to suffer so much and try to pluck the moon from the sky?" The three of them did not accept this "sympathy." They said: "Creation is revolution, and revolution is to overcome numerous difficulties."

    When the one hundred and sixty-fifth experiment began, they found the reason why they could not stop automatically: the main pulling force was the spring, not the iron bar. Therefore, they changed the iron bar, which could move up, down, left, and right, to only move up and down, and used a spring to control its downward movement speed. After further improving some parts, the mine car could automatically stop where people needed it to stop.

    The Inspiration of Rice Milling
    Automatic stopping was achieved. The problem facing them was how to automatically load the coal from the hopper into the mine car, which was another difficult problem. In those days, the three of them were so obsessed with this problem that they lost themselves. The house of young mine manager Li Ping, who loved to joke and play ball, no longer rang with laughter. In the past, people could find Li Ping on the court after dinner every day, but now he was nowhere to be seen on the court. Carpenter Yuan Hongfa, who had always been silent, was even harder to hear a word from for half a day or even a day. Huang Lewen, a youth activist in the mine, also changed his past norm and became an active smoker. The three of them were either holding "Zhuge Liang meetings" together, or each was meditating at their work posts or residences. They thought during the day, they thought at night, they thought during working hours, and they thought during rest time. They had really reached the state that people described as "forgetting to take the basin when washing their face, going to the wrong door when sleeping, dropping the bowl when eating, and bumping into people when walking."

    In persistent and continuous experimentation, they went through more than fifty failures, and finally made it possible for the hopper bottom door to open automatically. However, the three were still extremely anxious because it could not automatically close.

    The three of them all lived very close to home, but since the innovation started, they had never been home. One day, Yuan Hongfa was so busy that he was covered in sweat and his clothes were soaked through. He was so dirty that he had no choice but to hurry home in the moonlight to take a bath and change his clothes.

    His home was only a dozen miles away from the mine, and it was with the happy cafeteria of the work team. When he called to open the door, he saw the people in the cafeteria were using a wooden mortar to pound rice. When he saw people stepping on the mortar, going up and down freely, his heart jumped with joy.

    "Isn't this the key we need to solve? If we put two sets of circular, drooping iron chains on the door of the hopper, and put two iron mouths on the mine car, when the empty mine car rushed up, wouldn't the iron mouth touch the iron chains and open the door? Then, if we put springs and bamboo pieces on the door, using the lever principle of pounding rice, wouldn't the switch automatically close after the mine car drove away?"

    Yuan Hongfa was so happy that he didn't bother to take a bath. He just hurriedly took his clothes and returned to the mine. After studying with Li Ping and Huang Lewen overnight, he immediately started working.

    This key, which had failed thirty-five times, was broken through using the lever principle under the inspiration of an inconspicuous daily life phenomenon—rice pounding.

    In the design and improvement of many components, they overcame one difficulty after another with such persistent spirit.

    The Last Person Was Eliminated
    After overcoming many difficulties, the automatic loading and unloading transportation line had achieved automatic stopping, automatic coal loading, and automatic driving. All four major components of the entire line had achieved automation. Only one person was needed at the coal unloading point to move the switch of the mine car bottom door. This automatic coal unloading, which seemed simple but was very difficult to do, became the key to whether this line could achieve unmanned and unpowered automatic loading and unloading with indigenous methods. They went through dozens of tests again, but they were always unsuccessful. Li Ping and others felt sad when they came to the site and saw this "tail," but there was no way to solve it.

    This problem also became the focus of attention for the party and the masses of the entire mine. Party Branch Secretary Tang Yongyang squeezed out time from his busy schedule and studied with the three of them. After several days of joint research and joint labor, they finally discovered the main reason why they could not automatically unload coal, and in response to these reasons, they worked with the workers and went through fifty-seven tests. Finally, they installed a spring on the bottom door control rod, set a card on the middle beam, and installed a horizontal bar in the space a little higher than the car at the unloading point. In this way, when the mine car bumped against the horizontal bar, the bottom door control rod automatically fell, the bottom door automatically opened, and the coal automatically unloaded. After the coal was unloaded, the empty car was driven by the heavy car, and the bottom door of the mine car automatically closed using the elasticity of the two bow-shaped bamboo pieces set inside the track.

    This unmanned and unpowered automatic transportation line, which was one hundred and seven meters long, was finally successfully trial-produced for the four hundred and eighth time after more than two months of painstaking design and continuous improvement.

    Indigenous Methods Can Take Off, and Can Also Go to the Sky
    This unmanned and unpowered automatic loading and unloading transportation line only used ten cubic meters of wood, two thousand one hundred bricks, fifty kilograms of scrap iron, ten southern bamboos, eight 0.3-meter-long springs twisted by iron rods, two hundred and ten meters of hemp rope, and two fifteen-kilogram stones, costing less than three hundred yuan in total, which was more economical than buying a small electric motor. But it connected the underground lifting, crushing, screening, loading, unloading, transporting, and weighing processes, simplified five processes, saved one hundred and five workers, and could crush, select, and transport 240 tons of coal per day. The mine's production also soared, with the daily output of raw coal increasing from 126 tons to 305 tons, an increase of 138%, and the daily output of coke increasing sharply from 14 tons to 40 tons, an increase of more than three times. The ground transportation labor force was reduced from 170 people to 15 people, and the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced. The cost of raw coal was reduced from 14 yuan per ton to 4.5 yuan.

    This victory not only powerfully refuted the erroneous view of those who believed that "indigenous methods can only get you started, how can they take you to the sky," but also further liberated the thinking of the broad masses, and explored a new way to achieve mine loading and unloading automation quickly, well, and economically with indigenous methods.

    The Hengyang Prefectural Committee and the Qiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party vigorously promoted the "408" unmanned and unpowered automatic loading and unloading transportation line. In a very short period of time, 102 lines have been promoted in the Hengyang Special Zone.

    “四零八”自动线的诞生
    本报记者　刘耀黎　敖立魁
    6月下旬，我们在湖南省祁阳县石梓塘矿，看到了一条不用一般动力带动，也不用人操作便可以自动装煤卸煤的运输自动线。这个只有四百多个工人、两对煤井的小煤矿，已安装了五条这样的自动线，代替了一百零五名工人的繁重体力劳动。
    这条自动线高约一丈多，有两层木架，装有筛选设备和装煤的漏斗，木架底下，设有两条十度斜坡的包着铁皮的木轨道，两个矿车一上一下地在轨道上奔驶，把煤运到指定的地方去。自动线工作起来是十分有趣的。它不要其他动力，也不要人力操纵，完全靠一个装着煤的重矿车下滑时产生的力量，带动整个自动线的各个环节。工作起来，由装满煤的矿车顺轨道滑下去，空矿车便爬上来，轻矿车到了漏斗下面，漏斗便自动打开，经过筛选的煤便流进矿车，达到一定重量，漏斗自行关闭。漏斗装煤是十分准确的。做到“多一斤不要，少一斤不走”。当重煤车开始向下滑行时，原来那个重煤车早在下边自动卸了煤，又向上爬行了，它的底板还是敞开的，上边的重煤车滑下来，它就被拖上去，接近漏斗时，底板又自行关闭，又在漏斗底下装煤……这样循环不息，根本不要人来照料。这条自动运输线每天运出多少煤，由一个计数器向人们报告。
    这条自动运输线是这个煤矿的矿长和两个工人创造的，因为几乎每个零件都经过几十次上百次的试验，直到四百零八次才创造成功，人们便用“四零八”无人无机（指不要另外的动力）自动装卸运输线作为这台自动化装置的名字。
    这条自动线的诞生，经过了不少曲折。
    知难而进
    石梓塘煤矿是在1958年大跃进中由小煤窑发展起来的。今年2月上旬，这个矿还是一个小煤窑子，随着井下技术革新的开展，地面的装卸运输便成了阻碍生产的薄弱环节。地面装卸运输的人力，就占了全矿总人数的43％，每天只能生产九十吨煤，五点六吨焦，总是完不成县里规定的生产任务。
    如何改变这个局面呢？这个矿的党总支书记唐永扬和矿长李平一直在想办法。他们参观了祁阳煤矿用土洋结合的办法搞成的一条龙，找到了一条保证生产持续跃进的道路。但是，他们矿的设备和物质条件比祁阳煤矿差，是保持现状，还是知难而进改变现状呢？这个问题尖锐地提到了他们的面前。他们想起了矿内的情况，也记得县委书记贺天祥在一次报告中所讲的给人印象非常深刻的话：“知难而进是英雄本色，只有我们共产党人才能在最困难的条件下做出最好的成绩来。”两人商量后，决定要用土法搞出一条无人无机自动运输线来，一定要比祁阳煤矿土洋结合的机具大大提高一步，党总支并决定由李平具体负责这一工作。
    党总支提出这一任务时，虽然得到了绝大部分职工的积极拥护，但是，也遭到了部分有保守思想的人的反对。他们说：“土法只能上马，焉能上天！”有的说：就是洋机器，它也要用电带动，就是用电，也要按一下电钮！古今中外就没见过不用洋机器和电作动力的自动化。土、洋之争，成了当时舆论的中心。
    世界上是不是有不用洋机器的自动化呢？这的确是一个难题。李平正为这个问题苦恼着。他想：没有不用洋机器和电搞自动化的根据，又怎能说服群众，坚定群众的信心呢？那几天，他一直在思考着这个问题。一天，他忽然从窗外的微风和从热水瓶向茶杯里倒开水的小事情中得到启发：“不要洋机器可以得到动力，在自然界是存在的，风力和水力就是例证。这不就是用土法实现自动化的理论根据么？”
    找到了这个方向，但如何运用这种动力呢？他又联想到矿内从井下用绞车提煤的情形。他想：如果随着山坡的倾斜度，做两条平行的土铁路，土铁路上放两个矿车，用两条长绳联系起来，高处设一装煤台，台下安一个活动大轮盘，长绳在轮盘上穿过，运用以重带轻的原理，不就组成了自动运输线么？
    于是，今天的四零八自动线的雏形，就在他脑子里第一次出现了。他兴奋到了极点。马上找到过去和他一同搞革新的木工袁宏发和电工黄乐文。并研究了如何用这些道理驳倒不能用土办法实现自动化的论点。在第二天的辩论会上，他们拿出这些有力的根据，胜利地结束了这场土、洋之争。
    创造就是战胜困难
    “要想自动化，除非全身披洋挂，电线连电线，仪表机上插，嘴巴讲句话，机器开动啦！”这首在这里流行一时的歌谣，虽然表现了部分人对自动化的神秘感，但在一定程度上，也较形象地说明了自动化的复杂性。特别是对仅读了一期初中的矿长李平、读了半年老书的木工袁宏发和读了三年半书的做勤杂工“半路出家”的电工黄乐文来说，要用土办法和废料搞无人无机自动装卸运输线，的确是有很多困难的。
    几乎每一个零件都成为关键问题。但是他们想到的，是如何响应党的号召，迅速把煤运出去，支援钢铁工业。正因为有这样的坚强意志，所以一个又一个的困难，终于被他们征服了。
    开始，在设计停车问题上，他们用单车刈车、用铁钩吃住前轮。在路轨停车处钉橡皮减少摩擦力等办法试验。经过一百六十四次，都没有成功。
    “真的没有办法了吗？自动停车的理想不能实现了吗？”正当他们三人万分焦急的时候，一些有保守思想的人带着“同情”的口吻又出来说话了：“你们的干劲的确使人敬佩，你们这种为矿里搞革新的思想也值得学习，可是你们要知道，如果世界上真的能用土办法、土家伙实现自动化，人家大城市大厂矿早就搞成了，何苦要吃尽苦头，想摘下天上的月亮呢？”他们三人没有接受这种“同情”，他们说：“创造就是革命，革命就是要战胜重重的困难。”
    在第一百六十五次试验开始时，他们找出了不能自动停车的原因：起主要拉力作用的是弹簧不是铁条。于是，便把原来可以上下左右移动的铁条改为只能上下移动，并且用弹簧控制它向下移动的速度。再改进一些零件，矿车便可以在人们需要的地方自动停下来了。
    舂米的启示
    自动停车实现了。摆在面前的是如何使漏斗中的煤能自动装到矿车中去，这又是一个难题。那几天，三个人为这个问题想得入了迷。爱说笑爱打球的青年矿长李平的房子里，再也传不出朗朗的笑声，过去，人们每天晚饭后就能在球场里找到的李平，这时球场上再也看不到他的影子。一贯沉默的木工袁宏发，更是半天甚至一天也难听到他说一句话。矿里的青年活跃分子黄乐文也一变过去的常态，成了抽烟的积极分子。他们三人不是在一块开“诸葛亮会”，便是各人在各人的工作岗位上或住宿处沉思。他们白天想，夜里想，工作时间想，休息时间也想，真是到了像人们形容的“洗脸忘拿盆，睡觉走错门，吃饭掉了碗，走路撞着人”的境地。
    在坚持不断的试验中，他们又经过五十多次的失败，终于使漏斗底门可以自动打开了，但不能自动关闭起来，这三个人还是无限焦急。
    他们三人都离家很近，可是从搞革新起，就一直没有回过家。一天，袁宏发因为忙得满头大汗，全身的衣服湿透了，实在脏得不行了，他才不得已踏着月色赶回家去，想洗个澡，换换衣服。
    他的家离矿山只有十多里路，和作业组的幸福食堂在一起。当他喊开门时，只见食堂里的人正在用木碓舂米，他看到人踏着碓，一上一下，活动自如，心中喜得一跳。
    “这不就是我们要解决的关键么？如果把漏斗的门上安两副圆形的下垂铁链，矿车上安上两个铁嘴，空矿车一冲上来，铁嘴碰着铁链，不就把门打开了么？再在门上安上弹簧和竹片，利用碓舂米的杠杆原理，不又可以在矿车开走后，就自动把开关关上了么？”
    袁宏发高兴得顾不上洗澡，只匆匆拿了衣服，就回到矿里，同李平、黄乐文连夜研究后，马上动手干了起来。
    这个失败了三十五次的关键，在一个不令人注意的日常生活现象——舂米的启示下，用杠杆的原理突破了。
    在许多部件的设计、改进中，他们就是以这样坚持不懈的精神，战胜了一个又一个的困难。
    省掉了最后一个人
    自动装卸运输线经过战胜重重困难，已经实现了自动停车，自动装煤，自动开车，全线的四个主要组成部分都实现了自动化。只是卸煤点还需要有一个人搬矿车底门的开关。这个看来简单做起来很不容易的自动卸煤，却成了这条线是否能用土办法实现无机无人自动装卸的关键。他们又经过好几十次的试验，总没有破关。李平等一来到现场，看到这条“尾巴”就难过，但没有办法解决它。
    这个问题也成了全矿党和群众关注的中心。党总支书记唐永扬在百忙中也挤出了时间，和他们三人共同研究。经过几天共同研究和共同劳动，他们终于发现了不能自动卸煤的主要原因，并针对这些原因，和工人一道，又经过五十七次的试验，最后在底门控制杆上安上弹簧，中梁上设卡，在卸煤点比车子高一点的空间装一横杠。这样，矿车撞碰着横杠，底门控制杆自动下落，底门自动开门，煤自动卸出来。煤卸完后，空车被重车带动，通过轨道内设的两个弓形竹片的弹力，矿车底门也就自动关上了。
    这条全长一百零七米的无人无机自动运输线，经过两个多月的苦心设计和不断改进，终于在第四百零八次试制成功了。
    土法能上马，也能上天
    这条无人无机自动装卸运输线仅用了十立方米木材、二千一百块砖头、五十公斤废铁、十根南竹、八根零点三米长的自己用铁棍绞的弹簧、二百一十米麻绳，两个十五公斤的石头，总共花了不到三百元，比买一个小电动机还要经济。但它却把井下提升、破碎、筛选、装卸、运输、过磅等工序连接起来了，简化了五道工序，节省了一百零五个工人，一天可以碎、选、运煤二百四十吨。这个矿的生产也就扶摇直上，原煤日产量由一百二十六吨上升到三百零五吨，增加了138％，焦炭日产量由十四吨猛升到四十吨，增加了三倍多，地面运输劳力由一百七十人减少到十五人，同时工人劳动强度大大减轻，原煤成本每吨由十四元降低到四元半。
    这个胜利不但有力地反驳了那些认为“土法只能上马，焉能上天”的人的错误看法，而且进一步解放了广大群众的思想，为用土办法多快好省地实现矿山装卸自动化，摸索到了一条崭新的道路。
    中共衡阳地委和祁阳县委大力推广“四零八”无人无机自动装卸运输线，在很短的时间内，衡阳专区已推广了一百零二条。
