    Steel Production Increases Greatly, Transportation is Key
    Li Fu

    A key to greatly increasing steel production is transportation. To fulfill and overfulfill this year's steel production plan, the transportation department must continuously ensure that the steel industry receives an adequate supply of "grain and grass."

    A large increase in steel production will inevitably lead to a large increase in transport volume. For example, for every ton of steel produced by a large iron and steel complex, the internal transport volume will increase by about sixteen tons, and the railway trunk line transport volume will increase by seven and a half tons. In other words, if these sixteen tons and seven and a half tons of transport volume are not resolved, this ton of increased steel production will be problematic, so transportation is a key. A large increase in transport volume brings a more arduous task to the transportation department. How can this task be completed? Facts have proven that promoting advanced experience is a major method. The overall transformation of railway station lines currently underway in many regions is an advanced experience that addresses both the symptoms and root causes, greatly accelerating vehicle turnover. Consider this: After the transformation of special lines in Harbin, the number of lines suitable for loading and unloading entire trains has increased from twenty-two to forty-one. In the second quarter, train stop time was shortened by more than one hour compared to the first quarter. After the completion of the first phase of the overall transformation of the Tianjin railway freight yard and special lines, the vehicle stop time at Tianjin Station was shortened from eleven or twelve hours to about six hours. If all stations shorten their stop time by one or two hours through overall transformation or other methods, it would be equivalent to adding thousands of freight cars, and the transportation capacity would be greatly increased.

    All raw materials and equipment serving steel production are the priority among priority materials, and the transportation plan for these materials must be completed first. At the same time, factories and mines must also create convenient conditions for transportation.

    钢铁大增产，运输是关键
    犁夫
    钢铁大增产，运输是一个关键。完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划，运输部门必须不间断地保证钢铁工业得到充足的“粮草”供应。
    钢铁大增产，必然带来运量的大增加。比如，一个大型钢铁联合企业，每增产一吨钢，厂内运量就要增加十六吨左右，铁路干线运量要增加七吨半。换句话说，如果不解决这十六吨和七吨半的运量，这一吨钢的增产就会成问题，所以说运输是一个关键。运量大增加，给运输部门带来更繁重的任务。怎样完成这个任务呢？事实证明，推广先进经验是一个主要的方法。最近许多地区正在进行的铁路站线总体改造，就是一个治标又治本、大大加快车辆周转的先进经验。请看：哈尔滨市的专用线改造以后，适于整列装卸的线路已由二十二条增加到四十一条，第二季度列车停留时间比第一季度缩短一个多小时；天津市铁路货场和专用线总体改造第一期工程完成后，天津站车辆停留时间由十一、二小时缩短到六小时左右。如果所有车站都通过总体改造或其他办法把站停时间缩短一小时、两小时，就等于增加了成千辆的货车，运力也就大大增加了。
    一切为钢铁生产服务的原材料和设备，是重点物资中的重点，必须保证首先完成这些物资的运输计划。同时，厂矿企业也要为运输创造方便的条件。
