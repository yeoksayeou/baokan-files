Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 5th: Wuhan city departments are closely coordinating with Hubei province's rural "Four Transformations and Two Eliminations" movement, vigorously assisting agricultural technical transformation in a planned and leadership-driven manner.

    The "Four Transformations and Two Eliminations" are: transforming manual irrigation and drainage into mechanized, semi-mechanized irrigation and drainage, and gravity-flow irrigation; transforming shoulder-carrying into vehicle and boat transportation; transforming old-fashioned agricultural tools into improved agricultural tools; and transforming manual processing of agricultural and sideline products into mechanized and semi-mechanized processing; eliminating shoulder-carrying and manual water lifting. To aid rural areas in realizing the "Four Transformations and Two Eliminations," Wuhan is actively carrying out activities of urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture. Each district, system, and factory enterprise has generally established fixed cooperative relationships with the city's counties and communes, focusing on equipping county and commune agricultural tools that play an important role in realizing the "Four Transformations and Two Eliminations," actively assisting in developing county and commune industries, cultivating technical forces, and helping counties and communes gradually build agricultural machinery repair and assembly networks to achieve the requirement of "major repairs not leaving the county, medium repairs not leaving the commune, and minor repairs not leaving the management area." By the beginning of June, the city had supported rural areas with 380 various machine tools, more than 40,560 various tools (pieces), 354 various power and electrical equipment units, and more than 4,500 tons of various raw materials.

    Based on the needs of the agricultural season, the city launched several campaign-style production efforts this year, rushing to manufacture agricultural implements for rural areas. For example, to support wheat harvesting and rice transplanting, the city rushed to produce 200,000 sickles, more than 33,000 rice transplanters, as well as a large number of vehicles and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, etc. Districts and systems also organized technical service teams to go to the countryside to rush to repair agricultural machinery. During the busy days of wheat harvesting and rice transplanting, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also organized 50,000 cadres, workers, and students from various agencies, factories, and schools in the urban area to go to the countryside to participate in "Double Rush," vigorously supporting agricultural production.

    Because workers in all districts, systems, and factory enterprises in the city understand that helping agricultural technical transformation is the glorious historical task of the working class, they have demonstrated great initiative in supporting agriculture, making every effort to overcome difficulties, vigorously engaging in technical innovation and collaboration, and comprehensively completing their own factory production and support for rural tasks.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 5th: Finance and trade departments in various parts of Yunnan are conscientiously serving agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, they have trained more than 200,000 agricultural technicians for people's communes in various places through holding various short-term training courses. This group, including rice transplanter operators, deep plowing operators, gas engine operators, and technicians in manufacturing pesticides, fertilizers, aromatic oils, and raising pigs and bees, has now become the backbone force for promoting agricultural machinery, new agricultural implements, and developing diversified operations in various places.

    In the first half of this year, the various agricultural production materials supplied by Yunnan's finance and trade departments to communes in various places increased by 150% compared with the same period last year. Because a large number of technical forces capable of mastering these new types of machinery were trained in advance, technology came first, and supply followed, so that this batch of agricultural machinery could be quickly put into production after arriving in the countryside. By helping communes train and cultivate technical personnel, cadres and workers in many finance and trade departments have also been trained, familiarized themselves with the performance of agricultural machinery, mastered production technology, and become truly "both salespersons and technicians."

    武汉职工积极主动支援农业
    云南财贸部门为公社培养二十多万名技术人员
    据新华社武汉5日电　武汉市各部门紧密配合湖北农村“四改两消灭”运动，有计划有领导地大力帮助农业技术改造。
    “四改两消灭”就是改人力排灌为机械、半机械排灌和自流灌溉，改肩挑为车船运输，改旧式农具为改良农具，改人力加工农副产品为机械、半机械加工；消灭肩挑和人力车水。武汉市为了帮助农村“四改两消灭”，积极开展了城市支援农村、工业支援农业的活动。各区、各系统和工厂企业普遍同市属各县、社建立了固定的协作关系，以装备对实现“四改两消灭”起重要作用的县、社农具，为重点，积极帮助发展县、社工业培养技术力量，帮助县、社逐步建成农业机械修配网，实现“大修不出县、中修不出社、小修不出管理区”的要求。到6月上旬，全市共支援了农村各种机床三百八十台，各种工具四万零五百六十多台（件），各种动力、电机设备三百五十四台，各种原料材料四千五百多吨。
    根据农时季节的需要，今年全市开展了几次战役性生产，突击为农村制造农业机具。例如为了支援割麦、插秧，全市突击生产了镰刀二十万把，插秧机三万三千多部，以及大批车辆、农副产品加工工具等。各区、系统并组织技术服务队下乡，突击抢修农业机械。在割麦、插秧两头忙的日子里，中共武汉市委还从市区各机关、工厂、学校组织五万名干部、工人和学生下乡参加“双抢”，有力地支援了农业生产。
    全市各区、各系统和各工厂企业职工由于懂得了帮助农业技术改造是工人阶级的光荣的历史任务，因而在支援农业中表现了极大的主动性，千方百计地克服困难，大搞技术革新和协作，全面完成本厂生产和支援农村的任务。
    新华社昆明5日电　云南各地财贸部门认真为农业生产服务，今年以来通过举办各种短期训练班，已经为各地人民公社培训了农业技术人员二十多万人。这批包括插秧机手、深耕犁手、煤气机手及制造农药、化肥、芳香油和养猪、养蜂的技术人员，目前已经成为各地推广农业机械、新式农具和开展多种经营的骨干力量。
    今年上半年，云南省财贸部门供应给各地公社的各种农业生产资料，比去年同期增长一倍半，由于事前培训出一大批能够掌握这些新型机具的技术力量，作到了技术在先，供应在后，因此使这批农业机具到达农村后，很快就能投入生产。通过帮助公社训练、培养技术人员，许多财贸部门的干部和职工也得到了锻炼，熟悉了农业机械性能，掌握了生产技术，成为名副其实的“既是营业员，又是技术员”。
