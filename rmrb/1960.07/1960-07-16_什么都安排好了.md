　　Everything is Arranged

　　Most of the people living in our collective dormitory are young men. Which young man doesn't want to be ambitious? Whether it's participating in collective activities or studying, no one wants to fall behind others. Therefore, after work, with a little free time, we want to participate in cultural and sports activities and also want to study. Sometimes, we simply can't arrange the time, so we stuff the dirty clothes and socks that should be washed under the bed. As for cleaning the room, we drag it out as much as possible. When we really can't drag it out any longer, we launch a major blitz, cleaning everything once. As for things like sewing and mending, we are embarrassed to always ask the female comrades for help, so we only clumsily sew a few stitches when things are so torn that they are beyond recognition.

　　With the great leap forward in production, the Party is even more concerned about the lives of our workers. In addition to caring about whether we eat well and sleep well, it even takes care of all the trivial matters of daily life. We have established full-time service personnel for our collective dormitory, who are specifically responsible for cleaning the hygiene of each room and assisting our single workers with some daily chores.

　　Now, we are like guests staying in a hotel. Every day after work, as soon as you enter the dormitory, look! The floor is wiped clean and bright, the glass windows are also wiped shiny, and the bedding is washed and ironed neatly. As soon as you enter the room, you feel very clean and refreshed. As for buying daily necessities, mailing letters, and handling savings deposits, these daily chores are simply too convenient. As long as you leave a note on the table before you leave, the service personnel will handle it thoughtfully for you. Even movie tickets don't need to be bought by yourself. Just register with the service personnel in advance, and when you come back in the evening, the ticket will be on your table.

　　Under the care of the Party and the enthusiastic and thoughtful service of the service personnel, our lives are truly too happy. Comrades all say with emotion: We must redouble our efforts in production and study, and use outstanding production results to answer the Party's concern.

### 什么都安排好了

　　什么都安排好了
    我们集体宿舍里住的大部分是年青小伙子，青年人谁不好强呢？无论是参加集体活动，或是学习，谁都不愿意落在别人的后面。因此，下班后有点业余时间，又想参加文娱体育活动，又想学习，有时时间实在安排不开，就把应该洗的脏衣服、袜子等往床底下一塞；至于打扫屋子，更是能拖就拖，实在拖不过去了，就来它个大突击，总清理一次。其它像缝缝补补的事，我们不好意思总是让女同志帮忙，也是到实在破的不像话了，才笨手笨脚地缝几针。
    随着生产上的大跃进，党对我们职工的生活更加关怀，除了关心我们要吃得好，睡得好，就连日常生活琐事也全部包下来了，给我们集体宿舍设立了专职服务员，专门负责打扫各个房间的卫生和协助我们单身职工办理一些生活琐事。
    现在，我们就像住在旅馆里的客人一样。每天下班后，一进宿舍，你看吧！地板擦的净亮，玻璃窗也擦得亮堂堂的，被褥拆洗的干干净净，洗好的衣服烫得平平整整。一进屋，就使你感到非常清洁爽快。至于买日用品、寄信、办理储蓄等生活琐事，那简直是太方便了，只要你临走时在桌子上留个条子，服务员就会给你办得周周到到的，甚至连电影票都不用自己去买，事先在服务员那里登记一下，晚上回来票就放在你的桌子上了。
    在党的关怀和服务员热情周到的服务下，我们的生活真是太幸福了。同志们都感动地说：我们一定要在生产上、学习上再加把劲，用优异的生产成绩来回答党的关怀。
