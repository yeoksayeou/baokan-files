Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of "Nanniwan." While completing training and other tasks, they have vigorously developed agricultural and sideline production, focusing on pig raising and vegetable growing. A bumper harvest was achieved in the first half of this year, with most units now basically self-sufficient in meat and vegetables. Some units with surpluses have even supported fraternal units and local markets.

Last year, most PLA units reached the level of basic self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables. This year, the troops are advancing victoriously, continuously reclaiming wasteland, expanding "ten-edge" fields, and increasing cultivated land area. According to incomplete statistics, the amount of land cultivated this year has increased by 84% compared to last year. In order to strive for complete self-sufficiency in non-staple foods, many units have established more than 700 farms and ranches in addition to fully utilizing the land around barracks for raising pigs and growing vegetables. With the expansion of cultivated land area, the quantity of vegetable production in the first half of this year increased by more than double the same period last year, meat increased by about 70%, and there were also considerable increases in livestock, poultry such as cattle, sheep, chickens, and fish, and oil crops. The non-staple foods produced by self-run bean processing, flour milling and other workshops have also guaranteed most of the needs of the troops. Due to the continuous enrichment and improvement of production experience and production technology, many troops have achieved seamless connection of vegetables in all seasons, and all-round development and comprehensive harvests in agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

The agricultural and sideline production of the troops is carried out under the personal leadership of party committees at all levels, based on the goal of complete self-sufficiency in meat, vegetables, and edible oil. In the production process, the entire army acted together, and many battle-hardened old generals, like young soldiers, reclaimed wasteland, planted vegetables, raised pigs, and accumulated manure. Jia Ningguan, the deputy political commissar of a certain regiment and a production expert in Nanniwan in those years, went to the ranch to feed piglets and take care of sows day and night in order to explore pig-raising experience. Liu Xifu, a senior colonel of a certain unit of the Guangzhou area troops, led officers and soldiers deep into the barren mountains, started from scratch, and built seventeen farms and ranches. Leading cadres went to the front line to help the troops overcome many difficulties in production. If there was not enough time, the officers and soldiers made full use of gaps such as early mornings and evenings, and vigorously carried out technical innovations to improve labor efficiency. If there was insufficient experience, they sent people out to seek advice from teachers and friends, and convened on-site meetings to exchange experience. A unit stationed in a certain mountainous area could not sow the wasteland they had opened up because there were many rocks on the mountain and the soil layer was very thin. Under the heroic slogan of "carrying ten thousand loads of soil and paving a large vegetable garden," the officers and soldiers went down the mountain to carry soil and pave the ground, and with the spirit of "the foolish old man removing the mountain," they paved more than 1,900 plots of vegetable land, totaling more than 60 mu. When they sowed the seeds and they had just grown into a patch of greenery, a strong wind blew them all away. They then built walls around the vegetable garden and planted wild pineapple.

All troops, based on the spirit of diligent production and frugal management of farms, saved as much as possible, and did what they could do themselves. The livestock farms, pigsties, cattle barns, sheepfolds, etc. of many units were all built by themselves by quarrying stone and felling trees on the mountains. The production tools of many troops were also made by themselves from picking up scrap steel and rotten iron. A certain unit of the Guangzhou area troops started from scratch and established a farm with more than 1,000 mu of land, and built more than 2,800 square meters of dormitories and pigpens. A certain unit of the Beijing area troops recently manufactured more than 9,000 pieces of agricultural tools from scrap iron and waste wood. Under the spirit of adapting to local conditions and making do with whatever is available, some troops have adopted many production methods that save money, save manpower, and yield large harvests. A certain unit stationed on the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang grazes sheep on isolated islands, which requires neither feed nor people to watch over them, and the harvest is very large. Some troops stationed in high mountains also benefit greatly from grazing cattle on the mountains. Troops stationed in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other places often combine training with hunting during the hunting season, achieving both at once.

    发扬“南泥湾”的光荣传统
    解放军官兵大抓农副业生产
    绝大部分部队肉、菜等副食品基本上已能自给
    新华社30日讯　中国人民解放军继承和发扬了“南泥湾”的光荣传统，在完成训练等各项任务的同时，大力开展以养猪种菜为主的农副业生产。今年上半年获得了丰收，绝大部分部队肉菜基本上已经自给，一些自给有余的单位，还支援了兄弟部队和当地市场。
    去年，解放军大部分部队达到了肉菜基本上自给的水平。今年，各部队乘胜前进，不断开垦荒地，扩种“十边”田，扩大耕地面积。据不完全统计，今年耕种土地的数量，比去年增加了84％。为了争取副食品全部自给，许多部队在充分利用营房周围土地养猪、种菜以外，还建立了七百多个农牧场。随着耕地面积的扩大，今年上半年蔬菜生产的数量比去年同期增长一倍多，肉类增长70％左右，牛、羊、鸡、鱼等家畜家禽和油料作物也有不少的增长。自办的豆类加工、制粉等作坊所生产的副食品，也保证了部队大部分的需要。由于生产经验和生产技术不断丰富和提高，许多部队已经做到了蔬菜季季衔接，农、牧、副、渔全面发展，全面丰收。
    部队农副业生产是在各级党委亲自领导下，本着肉、菜、食油全部自给的目标进行的。在生产过程中，全军上下一齐动手，许多身经百战的老将军和青年战士一样，垦荒种菜，养猪积肥。当年南泥湾的生产能手、某团副政委贾宁官为了摸索养猪经验，曾到牧场不分昼夜地喂养小猪，照顾母猪生育。广州地区部队某部刘喜福大校，率领官兵深入荒山，白手起家，建起十七座农牧场。领导干部深入第一线，帮助部队克服了生产中的许多困难。时间不够，官兵们一面充分利用早晚等空隙时间，一面大闹技术革新，提高劳动效率。经验不足，一面派人外出求师拜友，一面召开现场会，交流经验。驻在某山区的一支部队因为山上石头多，土层很薄，开出来的荒地无法播种，官兵们在“挑上万担土，铺成大菜园”的豪迈口号下，下山挑土铺地，以“愚公移山”的精神，铺出一千九百多块共六十多亩菜地。他们播下种子，刚长得一片油绿时，一场大风，全部刮走，他们又在菜地周围垒上了围墙，种上了野菠萝。
    各部队都根据勤俭生产、勤俭办场的精神，能节省就节省，能自己干就自己干，不少单位的畜牧场、猪舍、牛厩、羊圈等全是自己上山采石伐木盖成的，许多部队的生产工具，也是自己拾废钢烂铁制造出来的。广州地区部队某部，白手起家，建立一个有一千多亩土地的农牧场，盖起了二千八百多平方米宿舍和猪圈。北京地区部队某部最近用废铁、废木料制造的农具有九千多件。在因地制宜、因陋就简的精神下，有些部队采用许多省钱、省人、收获大的生产方法。驻浙江舟山群岛的某部在孤岛上放羊，既不用饲料，也不用人看，收获很大。一些驻高山的部队，在山上放牛，收效也很大。内蒙古、新疆等地驻军还常在狩猎季节，结合训练外出打猎，一举双收。
