At a meeting attended by President Dorticos today, 600 residents who had been living in slums during the Batista regime received 400 newly built homes.

The building materials for these houses were provided by the Ministry of Public Welfare, and the residents of Manzanada Gomez built them themselves in six months. Currently, another 203 houses are under construction.

According to the Minister of Public Welfare at a press conference in Santiago last night, the government is solving the housing problems of these poor people and also solving their unemployment problems. Two hundred people in this area will work in the screw factory under construction, and production cooperatives and other factories will be established to create employment opportunities for them.
