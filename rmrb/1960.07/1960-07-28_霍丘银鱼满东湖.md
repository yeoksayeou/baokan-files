Huoqiu's silver fish has always been famous for its delicious and tender taste. Legend has it that Zhu Hongwu, who was a monk at Lingshui Temple in Huoqiu, still missed the silver fish of Huoqiu after becoming emperor and listed it as a tribute, requiring the people to "offer" it every year. However, in the past, although Huoqiu had abundant silver fish, the yield was extremely low, and only a few sporadic sales were seen even in the Huoqiu market. After liberation, the situation completely changed: wooden rafts were replaced by large sailing ships, and the "fish seedlings" became the masters of the lake. Especially after the people's communes were established, the fishermen joined the communes with joy and set up fishing brigades, and the production of silver fish developed even faster.

The silver fish fishing season has arrived. The fishermen of the East Lake Fish Farm in Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, have launched their newly repaired wind-powered net boats and are sailing back and forth on East Lake all day long…

    "When the sun comes out and shines in all directions,
    We happily see the harvest and people are doubly busy;
    Let's go to the lake with one heart and one mind,
    Leaving early and returning late with baskets full of fish…"

Early in the morning, I had just packed my things and was preparing to return to the county seat from here when suddenly a burst of loud singing attracted me. I thought: after a long rain, this is a good time to catch silver fish, maybe I can catch a ride on a boat. So, I went straight to the place where the singing was coming from. I took a look, hey! Twenty-three large boats were lined up in a row on the lake, and the young men of the fishing brigade were hoisting sails and casting nets while singing, working hard and happily. After a while, a young woman with short hair and an oval face nimbly jumped off the wooden raft, picked a high spot, and shouted into the broadcasting horn: "Hey, comrades, pay attention, according to the weather forecast: today is sunny, the wind is easterly, and the wind force on the lake is five to six. Comrades, don't miss the opportunity, set sail immediately!" After shouting, she shook the wooden raft and went to conduct a boat-by-boat inspection before departure.

I only met her yesterday, she is Comrade Lu Wenying, the deputy captain of the fishing brigade. I heard that two years ago, she was still a "greenhorn" who didn't understand anything, but under the leadership of the Party, she has now grown into a female hero on the water.

"Comrade Bian, aren't you going back to the county? Come on, I'll take you to Longquan to disembark, only eight miles from the county!" As she said that, Xiao Lu brought the raft to the shore.

Of course, I was overjoyed, jumped on the small raft and asked, "Xiao Lu, how is the silver fish this year?"

"You see—" Xiao Lu paddled hard, and I saw that the oar was covered with white little fishes, truly lovable.

"Not bad, but a little small!" I said.

"Ha, says you are a person who uses a pen, 'needle-sized' are too small, 'yellow flower heads' are too old, 'two-finger strips' are just right!" Xiao Lu's two bright eyes flashed with excitement, and she continued: "See, it's a great harvest!"

Xiao Lu stabilized the small raft, leaped onto the big boat, and reached out to pull me up as well.

The tense work began. All I heard was a burst of "clang, clang" of anchors being raised, and dozens of large boats sailed away like arrows. The old helmsman calmly held the rudder, and the young men either pulled the sails or punted with poles. But Xiao Lu was busier than everyone else, holding a small red flag in her hand, standing at the bow of the boat, waving it from side to side, concentrating on directing. I didn't bother her anymore, and took the opportunity to talk to Old Zhao on the boat:

"Hey, our East Lake has produced silver fish a long, long time ago, but we just couldn't catch much." Old Zhao said, "Alas, no wonder, the lake is tens of miles wide, as the saying goes: 'Without wind, there are three feet of waves,' how many boats didn't capsize every year before liberation. Do you know our Captain Yan? One year before liberation, when he went to the lake to catch silver fish and encountered a strong wind, only he survived from his family of five!"

Old Zhao quickly stood up, lifted the "net support" from the surface of the water, and poured a large pile of silver fish from the "inverted bag" (a kind of pocket tied to the end of the fishing net, through which the silver fish inside the net are pulled up to avoid lifting the net every time), sprinkled alum water on it, and salted and dried it at the same time. Then, the people on the other boats also busied themselves. But at this time, the fish in Wang Yilong's "inverted bag" was much less than others, and I was about to ask why when I saw a middle-aged man wearing a white cloth hat and light blue jacket and pants rowing a small raft over.

"Hey, the net is cast too deep, Old Wang!" the middle-aged man said, and then enthusiastically helped to tidy up the fishing net.

Who is he? Xiao Lu told me: His name is Wei Jiazhang, a good fisherman. Before liberation, he helped a big landlord, and all year round, he had little to eat and nothing to wear, a pair of torn pants and a rotten sack were all his belongings. After liberation, he turned over, and his little life was quite comfortable; but apart from his own affairs, he never cared about other people's affairs. Others criticized him for being selfish, he didn't agree, but this had all become a thing of the past. Since joining the commune in 1958 and forming a fishing brigade, he has gradually changed in the collective life and has become more and more fond of taking care of other people's affairs.

"Old Wei, pay according to work!" I joked deliberately.

"Hehe!" Old Wei smiled, "To tell you the truth, comrade, now I also have some communist ideas in my head!" As he said that, he patted his round head, making everyone laugh for a while…

The wind howled, and the endless East Lake was full of rolling waves, one wave after another, violently hitting the sides of the boat. However, the boats advanced side by side as if walking on flat ground; everyone was at their posts, calm and composed…

After Old Zhao spread out the silver fish evenly, he said with a smile: "You see, walking on the people's commune is like climbing a ladder, one step higher than the other. Last year, we caught 50,000 catties of silver fish, this year—look, 150,000 catties are guaranteed!"

"Old Zhao, 'airplanes are not blown, Mount Tai is not built up', 150,000 catties is not a joke!" Xiao Lu deliberately glanced at me, in fact, I already knew that their brigade had already set such a target. From her spirited look, it can be seen that she is not afraid of difficulties, but rather proud of this arduous task!

The sun was just east, and the boat arrived at Longquan, a young man rowed a raft and sent me ashore. At this time, I noticed that the awnings of all the boats were full of white, like a layer of silver, even more dazzling in the sun.

    霍丘银鱼满东湖
    卞维宗
    霍丘的银鱼，向来以味美鲜嫩著名。相传在霍丘临水寺当过和尚的朱洪武，做了皇帝以后，还念念不忘霍丘银鱼，曾列为贡品，要老百姓年年“进贡”。但是，过去霍丘虽有丰富的银鱼，但产量极低，连霍丘市场上也只有一些零星的出售。解放后，情况完全改观了：破木筏换成了大帆船，“鱼花子”一跃为湖上主人。特别是人民公社化以后，渔民们都欢欣鼓舞地入了公社，成立了捕捞大队，银鱼的产量获得了更快的发展。
    银鱼的捕捞季节到了。安徽霍丘县东湖鱼场的渔民们，把早已整修一新的风网船推下水，整日往来于城东湖上……
    “太阳出来照四方，
    喜看丰收人倍忙；
    同心合力下湖去呀，
    早出晚归鱼满筐……”
    大清早，我刚把东西收拾好，准备从这里赶回县城，忽然一阵嘹亮的歌声把我吸引住了。我想：久雨初晴，这正是捕捞银鱼的好时光，说不定还能搭上船呢。于是，我便径往唱歌的地方走去。一瞧，嘿！湖面上二十三只大船一字儿排着，捕捞大队的小伙子们一边张帆下网，一边唱着歌儿，紧张而愉快。过了一会，一个短头发、椭圆脸蛋儿的青年妇女敏捷地跳下木筏子，拣一块高地，对着广播筒喊道：“喂，同志们注意啦，据气象台预报：今天晴天，风向偏东，风力湖面上五到六级。同志们，机不可失，马上开船！”喊罢，又摇着木筏子进行出发前的逐船检查工作去了。
    她，昨天我才认识，是捕捞大队副队长卢文英同志。听人说，两年前还是个啥也不懂的“黄毛丫头”，但在党的领导下，如今已经成长为一名水上女英雄啦。
    “卞同志，你不是要回县吗，来吧，送你到龙泉下船，离县只有八里！”说着，小卢把筏子靠了岸。
    我当然喜出望外，跳上小筏子就问：“小卢，今年银鱼可好么？”
    “你看——”小卢用力一划，只见出水的橹面上满是白花花的小鱼儿，真喜爱人。
    “不少呗，可惜小了一点儿！”我说。
    “哈，说你是拿笔杆儿的人嘛，‘花针’太小‘黄花头’太老，‘二指条’正捉哩！”小卢那两只乌亮亮的大眼睛，闪着兴奋的光芒，接着道：“看见么，是个大丰收呵！”
    小卢稳了稳小筏子，一纵身上了大船，又伸手把我也拉了上去。
    紧张的工作开始了。只听一阵“铿铿锵锵”的起锚声，几十只大船像离弦的箭儿，扬帆而去。老艄公沉着地把着舵柄，小伙子们有的拉篷，有的点篙。但小卢比大家更忙，她手里拿着一面小红旗，立在船首，左右摆动，聚精会神地指挥着。我没有再打扰她，趁空和船上的老赵谈起来：
    “嗨，俺们东湖很早很早以前就出银鱼哪，可就是捕不多。”老赵说，“唉，也难怪呀，几十里宽的湖面，常言道：‘无风三尺浪’，解放前哪一年不翻几只船。你认识俺们的严队长吗？解放前一年，因为下湖捕银鱼遇到大风，一家五口就剩他一个人死里逃生呵！”
    老赵迅速地站起身，把水面上的“网撑子”一提，从“倒袋”（系在鱼网末端的一种口袋，网内银鱼通过它拉上来，免得每次起网）里倒出一大堆银鱼，洒上矾水，边腌边晒。接着，其他船上的人们也都忙碌起来。但是，这时候，独有王义龙的“倒袋”里的鱼比别人少得多，我正想问个究竟，只见一个头戴白布帽，身穿浅蓝褂裤的中年人荡着小筏子去了。
    “嗨，网下得太深啦，老王！”那中年人说着就热情地帮助拾掇鱼网。
    他是谁？小卢告诉我：他叫魏家章，是个捕鱼的好把式。解放前帮大工，一年到头，少吃无穿，一件破裤头，一条烂麻袋就是他的全部家当。解放后，翻了身，小日子过得挺舒适；可是除掉自家的事外，别人的事他是从来不过问的，别人批评他自私，他不服气，但这都已经成为过去的事了。自从1958年入了公社，成立了捕捞大队，在集体的生活里，他渐渐地变了，变得越来越爱管别人的事啦。
    “老魏，按劳取酬哩！”我故意开玩笑说。
    “嘿嘿！”老魏笑了笑，“不瞒你说，同志，如今俺这脑袋里也装有一些共产主义思想哩！”说着，他拍了一下圆脑袋，逗得大家哈哈大笑了一阵……
    风呼啸着，放眼望不到尽头的城东湖，波涛滚滚，一个浪头接着一个浪头，猛烈地撞击着船舷。然而，船并排前进，如履平地；大伙儿，各就各位，泰然自若……
    老赵把银鱼均匀地摊开以后，笑嘻嘻地说：“你看，走上人民公社，就像上梯梯，一步高一步，去年俺们捕捞银鱼五万斤，今年——瞧，十五万斤保证不含糊！”
    “老赵，‘飞机不是吹的，泰山不是垒的’呀，十五万斤可不是玩的呵！”小卢故意朝我望了一眼，其实，我已经知道他们大队早就订好了这么个指标。从她说话的神气里，可以看出，她并不是在畏难，倒是对这一艰巨的任务感到自豪哩！
    太阳刚正东，船就到了龙泉，一个小青年划着筏子把我送上岸。这时候，我才注意到：所有船的顶篷上都满是白花花的，像铺了层白银子，迎着阳光，更加耀眼。
