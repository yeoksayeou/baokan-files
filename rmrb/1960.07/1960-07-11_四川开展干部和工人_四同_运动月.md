Sichuan Launches "Four Together" Movement Month for Cadres and Workers
80% of Cadres on the Province's Industrial and Transportation Front Have Already Gone Deep into the Front Lines of Production
Leading Cadres of Various Departments Take the Lead in Realizing the "Four Together"; Coal Department Moves its Office to Key Coal Mines for On-Site Work

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 10th: Responding resolutely to the call of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, factory, mining, transportation enterprises, and basic construction units in Sichuan Province are rapidly and deeply launching a "Four Together" movement month—cadres and workers eating together, living together, working together, and consulting together—starting July 1st, to further promote the Party's mass line and the traditional style of hard work. Currently, over 80% of cadres on the province's industrial and transportation front have left their offices to settle down on the front lines of production, participate in production, lead production, share weal and woe with the masses, and realize a greater leap forward in industrial production and construction for July and the second half of this year.

Resolutely launching the "Four Together" movement month and making "Four Together" a regular working system is a significant measure by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to further strengthen leadership over industrial production and transportation, promote improved work styles and leadership levels among cadres at all levels, and adapt to the needs of the current situation. The Provincial Committee requires cadres at all levels to use the "Four Together" to more firmly establish a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint, achieving "moving the bedding, settling down in the mining area," closely connecting with reality, connecting with the masses, and, at the same time, through personal production practice, better implementing and understanding the Party's various policies, making leadership work more in line with objective reality. The Provincial Committee instructed all factory, mining, transportation enterprises, and basic construction units to make "Four Together" a regular working system and adhere to it for the long term. Cadres at all levels should stipulate the time for participating in labor each year, month, week, and day according to different work situations, constantly consult with the masses during labor, discover problems, and solve problems. At the same time, all regions and enterprises must conduct a practical inspection and arrangement of the living and welfare issues of employees based on the Provincial Committee's repeated instructions, abolish all cadre canteens in factories and mining enterprises, and all cadres must participate in eating in the workers' canteen, achieving leadership entering the canteen and dormitory, and politics entering the canteen and dormitory, combining strengthening political and ideological work with caring for the lives of employees, grasping both production and life, so that the masses of employees always maintain soaring enthusiasm and abundant energy, ensuring the continuous leap forward in production.

The Provincial Committee's call quickly turned into action throughout the province. From the provincial-level industrial and transportation leadership organizations to grassroots factories and mines, from large cities to small and medium-sized towns, cadres at all levels of industry and transportation are determined to turn July into a "Four Together" movement month, participating in production, leading production, and comprehensively completing the national plan for the third quarter and the whole year. Leading cadres of the Provincial Coal Department, Metallurgical Department, Machinery Department, Light Industry Department, Chemical Industry Department, Transportation Department, and other units took the lead in realizing the "Four Together." Some even moved their offices to key areas and key factories to implement on-site work and on-site command. At the same time, each department has transferred 80% to 85% of its cadres to the front lines of production to participate in labor and organize production. In order to effectively strengthen the production leadership of key coal mines along the transportation lines, the Coal Department, led by two department heads and the main cadres of the entire department, moved the central command organization to the Yongrong Mining Bureau, working in the coal mine and commanding production underground. At the same time, in the spirit of grasping large, medium, and small simultaneously, they organized a group of cadres to inspect the production and renovation work of large and small coal mines along the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu railways to ensure that these fifty key small coal mines serving coal use along the transportation lines complete the technical renovation work on schedule. Four of the five directors of the Metallurgical Department were dispatched to key factories and mines to help with work, and seven working groups were organized to inspect mountain production and construction in Leshan, Mianyang, Dazhou, and other special districts. In order to vigorously grasp the technical renovation equipment for mines, metallurgy, and small coal mines, the Machinery Department has transferred more than seventy of the ninety cadres of the department's central command in Chongqing to factories to conscientiously implement "Four Together" and help the factories summarize experience and solve production problems. At the same time, the industrial and transportation leadership departments and the vast number of cadres in various cities, special districts, and county also took immediate action and enthusiastically launched the "Four Together" movement. The industrial systems of Chongqing conducted careful and detailed research on the current problems in production. The cadres who went to the front lines of production firmly established the view of comprehensively completing the plan, grasping both output and quality, grasping both the quantity of products and the variety of products, ensuring a comprehensive leap forward in production. The vast number of cadres in factory, mining, transportation enterprises, and basic construction in Chengdu, led by leading cadres, went deep into the production site, worked while working, conducted on-site investigations and studies, summarized and promoted advanced experience; and paid attention to running worker canteens well and improving environmental sanitation, achieving a comprehensive grasp of ideology, production, and life. Currently, 84% of the cadres on the industrial front in Leshan Special District have reached the front lines of production. After the cadres of the Special District Coal Industry Bureau went down the mine, they participated in the production of tunneling, transportation, and renovation work surfaces, working with the workers to "break through" and "break through," striving to achieve results in a short period of time.

Launching the "Four Together" movement month and implementing the "Four Together" of cadres and workers on a regular and institutionalized basis is proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China based on the experience of advanced units such as Wangcang Coal Mine, Yutianpu Coal Mine, and Jianyin Rock Coal Mine. Since April this year, Wangcang Coal Mine has organized more than 80% of its cadres to the front lines of production, resolutely overcoming the unrealistic and unthorough work style, greatly invigorating the spirit of cadres and the masses, and promoting many effective advanced experiences. In less than a month, the daily output of raw coal increased from more than 700 tons to more than 1,500 tons, and in June it continued to increase to more than 2,000 tons, completing half of the annual plan ahead of schedule.

　　更好地树立劳动观点群众观点　更密切地联系实际联系群众
　　四川开展干部和工人“四同”运动月
　　全省工业交通战线已有百分之八十干部深入到生产第一线落户
　　各厅领导干部带头实现“四同”煤炭厅办事机构搬到重点煤矿现场办公
    本报成都10日电　四川省厂矿交通企业和基本建设单位坚决响应中共四川省委的号召，从7月1日起，正在迅速深入地开展一个干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的“四同”运动月，进一步发扬党的群众路线和艰苦奋斗的传统作风。现在，全省工业交通战线已有80％以上的干部走出办公室，到生产第一线落户，参加生产，领导生产，与群众同甘共苦，实现7月份和今年下半年工业生产建设的更大跃进。
    坚决开展干部“四同”运动月，并使“四同”成为一种经常性的工作制度，是中共四川省委进一步加强对工业生产和交通运输的领导，促使各级干部改进工作作风、提高领导水平、适应当前形势需要的一项重大措施。省委要求各级干部通过“四同”，更加牢固地树立劳动观点和群众观点，做到“铺盖搬家，矿区落户”，密切联系实际，联系群众，同时通过亲身的生产实践，更好地贯彻和体会党的各项方针政策，使领导工作更加切合客观实际。省委指示各厂矿交通企业和基本建设单位要使“四同”成为一种经常性的工作制度，长期坚持下去。各级干部要根据不同的工作情况，分别规定出每年每月每周每日参加劳动的时间，在劳动中经常和群众商量，发现问题，解决问题。与此同时，各地区各企业都必须根据省委屡次有关指示，对职工生活福利问题进行一次切实的检查和安排，所有厂矿企业设有干部食堂的都一律撤销，全体干部都参加工人食堂吃饭，做到领导进食堂进宿舍，政治进食堂进宿舍，把加强政治思想工作和关心职工生活结合起来，既抓生产又抓生活，使职工群众经常保持冲天的干劲和充沛的精力，保证生产持续跃进。
    省委的号召迅速在全省变成了行动。从省级各工业交通领导机构到基层厂矿，从大城市到中小城镇，各级工业交通干部都决心把7月变成“四同”运动月，参加生产、领导生产，全面完成三季度和全年国家计划。省煤炭厅、冶金厅、机械厅、轻工业厅、化工厅、交通厅等单位的领导干部带头实现“四同”，有的还把办事机构搬到重点地区和重点工厂实行现场办公，现场指挥，同时各厅都已分别抽调了80％—85％的干部到生产第一线，参加劳动，组织生产。煤炭厅为了切实加强交通沿线重点煤矿的生产领导，由两个厅长带领全厅主要干部把中心指挥机构搬到永荣矿务局，在煤矿办公，在井下指挥生产，同时本着大中小一起抓的精神，组织一批干部巡回检查成渝、宝成铁路沿线大小煤窑的生产和改造工作，以保证这些服务于交通沿线用煤的五十个重点小煤窑按期地完成技术改造工作。冶金厅五个厅长有四个被分别派到了重点厂矿帮助工作，同时还组织了七个工作组到乐山、绵阳、达县等专区，巡回检查矿山生产和建设。机械厅为了大抓矿山、冶金和小煤矿技术改造等设备，已将该厅驻重庆的中心指挥部的九十个干部，抽调了七十多人下厂，认真贯彻“四同”，并帮助各厂总结经验，解决生产问题。与此同时，各城市和专、县工业交通领导部门以及广大干部，也都纷纷立即行动，热烈地开展了“四同”运动。重庆市各产业系统针对当前生产上存在的问题进行了认真细致的研究，到生产第一线的干部，都牢固树立了全面完成计划的观点，既抓产量，又抓质量；既抓产品数量，又抓产品品种，保证生产全面跃进。成都市厂矿交通企业和基本建设的广大干部，分别由领导干部率领深入生产现场，边劳动、边工作，就地进行调查研究，总结和推广先进经验；并且注意办好工人食堂，搞好环境卫生，做到思想、生产、生活全面抓。乐山专区工业战线目前已有84％的干部到了生产第一线，该专区煤炭工业局干部下井以后，分别参加掘进、运输、改造工作面等生产，和工人一道“闯关”“破关”，力争在短期内作出成绩。
    开展“四同”运动月，实行干部和工人“四同”经常化、制度化，是中共四川省委根据旺苍煤矿、鱼田堡煤矿、拣银岩煤矿等先进单位的经验提出来的。旺苍煤矿从今年4月开始，就把80％以上的干部组织到生产第一线，坚决克服不踏实不深入的工作作风，使干部和群众的精神大为振作，推广了许多行之有效的先进经验，不到一个月，原煤日产量就由七百多吨上升到一千五百多吨，六月又继续上升到二千多吨，提前超额完成了全年计划的一半。（附图片）
