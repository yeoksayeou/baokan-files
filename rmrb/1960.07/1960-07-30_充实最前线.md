　　Enriching the Forefront

　　The Tashui Iron Plant's mine transferred more than 300 non-production personnel, auxiliary workers, and odd-job workers to strengthen the production frontline. As a result of the increase in labor and improved efficiency, the average daily output of ore increased by 35 percent. This provides an important experience for strengthening the mining industry and increasing the production of ore and coal.

　　In order to ensure the leap forward in steel, various regions are actively developing the mining industry. Some mines, in the process of opening up new mining areas, tunnels, and expanding mining areas, often encounter the first problem of insufficient labor. How to solve this problem? Support from the leadership is one aspect. However, for the mine itself, the main thing is to tap the internal labor potential of the enterprise. In this regard, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution to improve labor efficiency is a major way; and improving labor organization and compressing non-production personnel is also an important method.

　　There is great potential for improving labor organization and compressing non-production personnel. The Party Committee of the Tashui Iron Plant conducted a typical survey in one mining area, specifically analyzing the proportion of underground production personnel, management personnel, service personnel, and auxiliary workers, and found that underground production personnel accounted for only 65.2 percent of the total number of employees, proving that there is indeed great potential to be tapped by improving labor organization. The situation of non-production personnel and auxiliary workers accounting for too large a proportion is not an isolated phenomenon in the mining industry. As long as enterprise leaders go deep into the grassroots and carefully dissect the "sparrow," they will discover this potential.

　　Compressing non-production personnel is not only a powerful measure to solve the problem of insufficient labor on the production frontline, but also conducive to improving enterprise management. Continuously improving labor organization and regularly compressing non-production personnel to the minimum limit is one of the fundamental principles of socialist enterprise management. Conscientiously implementing this principle can better improve the efficiency of all employees, reduce product costs, and promote functional departments to improve working methods.

    充实最前线
    沓水铁厂矿山抽调非生产人员、辅助工和杂工等三百多人，加强生产第一线。由于劳动力增加和工效提高，矿石平均日产量增加了百分之三十五。这为加强采掘工业，增加矿石和煤炭产量提供了一项重要经验。
    为了保证钢铁跃进，各地都在积极发展采掘工业。有些矿山在增辟矿场、巷道，扩大开采面积的过程中，碰到的第一个问题常常是劳动力不够。怎样解决这一问题？领导部门的支持是一个方面。但是，就矿山本身来说，主要是挖掘企业内部的劳动潜力。在这方面，大搞技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动效率，是一个主要的途径；而改善劳动组织，压缩非生产人员，也是一个重要方法。
    改善劳动组织、压缩非生产人员潜力是很大的。沓水铁厂党委在一矿区作了个典型调查，对井下生产人员、管理人员、服务人员、辅助工人等的比重作了具体分析，发现井下生产人员仅占职工总数的百分之六十五点二，证明通过改善劳动组织来挖掘劳动潜力确实大有可为。像这种非生产人员、辅助工人比重过大的情况，在采掘工业部门并不是个别现象。只要企业领导人员深入基层，认真解剖“麻雀”，就会发现这种潜力。
    压缩非生产人员，不仅仅是解决生产第一线劳动力不足问题的一项有力措施，而且有利于改进企业管理。不断改善劳动组织，经常把非生产人员压缩到最低限度，是社会主义企业管理工作的根本原则之一。认真贯彻这一原则，就可以更好地提高全员效率，降低产品成本，并且推动职能机构改善工作方法。
