　  Indeed, Special Vigilance Must Be Maintained

France recently agreed to the independence of four West African countries currently within the "French Community": Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Upper Volta, and Niger, in early August. In addition, the French government announced on the 12th that it would recognize the independence of the former French Congo, Chad, and the Central African Republic within the "French Community" as well. This is something France has been forced to do in the face of the rising tide of African peoples' struggle for independence.

France's forced recognition of the independence of some African countries does not mean that French colonialism has really resigned itself to abandoning its colonial interests in these countries or is truly willing to let these countries embark on the road to independence and autonomy. This can be clearly seen from the talks between French Prime Minister Debré and the leaders of the national movements of Chad, the former French Congo, and the Central African Republic on the 13th.

Debré solemnly stated that the current African problem requires people to "maintain special vigilance." It is said that this is because "Africa is threatened externally by interests that are not in line with the interests of the African people, and internally by subversive movements." The French colonialists, who have been riding on the heads of the African people for many years, seeking colonial interests by harming the interests of the African people, have suddenly become the most enthusiastic defenders of the interests of the African people. Who would believe that?

For the African people, there has always been a threat that is not in line with their interests. Moreover, this threat still exists for those African peoples who have already achieved independence. This external threat does not come from anywhere else, but from the colonialists. What happened recently in the Congo fully proves this point. Although the Belgian colonial authorities were forced to recognize the independence of the Congo, they were not willing to truly give up their control over the Congo, and therefore launched an armed invasion on the second day of Congo's independence. The French colonialists are naturally not more generous than the Belgian colonialists. As for the "threat of subversive movements" internally, then this threat can only come from the colonialists. That is, when the governments of countries that have achieved independence adopt policies to safeguard national independence, the colonialists will carry out subversive conspiracies against them. Guinea has uncovered two subversive conspiracy cases in the past, weren't they all orchestrated by imperialism and colonialism?

Debré made such remarks with a solemn look for a specific purpose. He apparently wanted to intimidate the leaders of the three African countries that are about to declare independence: "In order to prevent external and internal threats, it is best to maintain close cooperation with France." Therefore, he repeatedly reminded: "Independence is not the solution to all problems." Debré's sentence can be understood from the opposite perspective. Indeed, independence is not the solution to all problems. Although the imperialists and colonialists are forced to recognize the independence of the colonial peoples, they are not completely dead-hearted. They will always use various means to threaten and undermine the independence of these countries. Therefore, the people of African countries that have already achieved independence must accept Debré's "advice": they must "maintain special vigilance."

### 确要特别保持警惕

　  确要特别保持警惕
    法国最近同意了目前在“法兰西共同体”内的象牙海岸、达荷美、上伏尔特和尼日尔四个西非国家在8月初独立，另外法国政府在12日又宣布承认前法属刚果、乍得和中非也将在“法兰西共同体”内独立。这是法国在非洲人民争取独立斗争高涨的形势下不得不为的。
    法国被迫承认一些非洲国家的独立，并不意味着法国殖民主义真的已甘心放弃他们在这些国家的殖民利益了，真是愿意让这些国家走上独立自主的道路了。这从法国总理德勃雷13日同乍得、前法属刚果和中非三国民族运动的领导人的谈话中，也可以清楚地看得出来。
    德勃雷煞有介事地说什么目前的非洲问题要求人们“特别保持警惕”。据说这是因为“非洲在外部受到同非洲人民的利益不相符合的利益的威胁，在内部受到颠覆运动的威胁。”多少年来骑在非洲人民头上，以损害非洲人民利益来谋求殖民利益的法国殖民者，一下却变成了非洲人民利益最热心的维护者，谁相信呢？
    对于非洲人民来说，的确一向就存在着同他们利益不相符合的威胁。而且这种威胁对于那些已经取得了独立的非洲人民来说，也依然存在。这种从外部来的威胁不是来自别的地方，而是来自殖民主义者。最近在刚果发生的事情就完全证明了这一点，比利时殖民当局虽然被迫承认了刚果的独立，但是却不肯真正放弃它对刚果的控制，因此在刚果独立的第二天，就又进行了武装侵略。法国殖民者自然也不会比比利时殖民者慷慨和大方些。至于说到内部“颠覆运动的威胁”，那末这种威胁也只会来自殖民主义者。那就是当取得了独立的国家的政府采取维护民族独立政策的时候，殖民主义者就会对它们进行颠覆的阴谋。几内亚过去曾破获过两次颠覆阴谋案，不都是帝国主义和殖民主义者搞的吗？
    德勃雷装出语重心长的样子说了这样一番话，是别有目的的。他显然是想对将要宣布独立的非洲三国领导人进行恐吓：“你们为了防止外部内部的威胁，最好还是和法国保持密切合作”。因此，他再三提醒：“独立并不是解决了一切问题”。德勃雷这句话倒可以从反面来理解。的确，独立并不是解决了一切问题。帝国主义和殖民主义者虽然被迫承认殖民地人民独立，但是并不是完全死心了的，它们总是会用各种各样的手段来威胁和破坏这些国家的独立。因此已经取得独立的非洲国家人民，的确要接受德勃雷的“忠告”：必须“特别保持警惕”。
