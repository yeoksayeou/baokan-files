　　Supporters
　　Li Ning
    Members of the Dali People's Commune in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, can often encounter many unfamiliar "guests" in the villages and fields. These "guests" are the "supporters" who come from all directions to the agricultural front line. Some work here for the long term, others for the short term, some are permanently assigned, and others provide temporary support. In short, they are selflessly working here to accelerate agricultural construction.
　　Old Professor Spending Weekends
    An elderly man with gray hair comes to the Dali Commune every Saturday afternoon and leaves on Sunday afternoon. After arriving, he either goes deep into the fields to observe production or discusses production issues with the commune's cadres.
    This elderly man who spends his weekends deep in the fields is Professor Zhao Shanjiu, the vice president of the South China Agricultural College and an expert in pest and disease control. The Dali Commune has become his second home. During the early rice season this year, he came here and saw that the rice fields were suffering from drought, and some winter crops had not been watered in time. The first generation of rice stem borers was flourishing. After discovering this situation, he immediately discussed prevention and control measures with the commune's Party committee, sparking a mass campaign to control rice stem borers in the commune. To help the commune's pest and disease control station members improve their skills and more accurately forecast the peak periods of rice stem borer outbreaks and egg-laying, he also helped the members learn techniques and related knowledge. This enabled the masses to focus their pest control efforts effectively, achieving significant results with minimal effort. As a result, very few rice fields in the commune experienced whiteheads (less than one in a thousand), ensuring increased production.
    Soil Analysis Expert
    Chen Bikai, the soil analysis expert of the Dali Commune, is a well-known figure. This young man only had five years of primary school education, but his knowledge of soil is now astonishing. He not only masters the techniques of analyzing soil in the laboratory but can also identify several different types of soil with the naked eye in the field and propose different methods of fertilization and soil improvement.
    Chen Bikai's growth is inseparable from the cultivation and assistance of "supporters". This young man was originally not interested in soil analysis at all. In 1958, scientific workers from the South China Agricultural College and other units established a fixed connection with this place and came here to help the commune with soil identification. The commune sent Chen Bikai to participate in this work. At that time, like some other young people, "his heart had already flown to the steelmaking furnace." He felt that digging wells in the fields to take soil samples and then analyzing them was simply a waste of time. However, the teachers and students of the South China Agricultural College and scientific workers from other units patiently explained to him the importance of soil analysis for production and lectured him on the scientific knowledge about soil, again and again. Later, when the soil identification was completed, Chen Bikai also became a "soil fanatic."
    Since then, Chen Bikai has diligently studied knowledge about soil and fertilizer. Teachers and students from the South China Agricultural College and scientific workers from other units also constantly came here to help the commune with soil surveys and fertilizer planning. Chen Bikai continued to learn soil knowledge from them. Today, Chen Bikai has become a skilled soil analysis expert. In March, when the National Soil Identification Conference was held, he and other soil analysis experts publicly demonstrated rapid soil analysis.
    With the support of various scientific units, the Dali Commune has also cultivated a large number of native scientific and technological talents like Chen Bikai. In the past two years alone, it has trained 275 meteorologists, 108 tractor drivers, 534 soil analysis personnel, and more than 6,000 rice transplanter operators, as well as a batch of car drivers and mechanized talents.
      People from Beijing
    One night in May, it was already past 12 o'clock. In the workshop of the Dali Commune's machinery factory, there was still a group of young people fighting hard. These were the "supporters" sent by the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College. They were here to design and manufacture a new type of rope-traction machine (electric plow) suitable for paddy field cultivation for the commune—the Nanhai No. 3.
    That night, these college students were busy sawing angle iron to make the electric plow frame. There was no electric saw in the Dali Machinery Factory, so they used a handsaw to saw. By midnight, the handsaw blades were used up, and the angle iron was not yet sawn. What to do? Stopping would hinder the welding tomorrow, and the manufacturing of the electric plow could not be stopped for a moment.
      "Use a steel chisel to cut it off!" Student Zhang Minxiu suggested. Zhao Jishan, Mu Ping, and other male and female students immediately started. They wielded large sledgehammers and struck the steel chisel, cutting the angle iron bit by bit. The students holding the steel chisel felt their hands numb, but everyone still worked non-stop until the angle iron was cut off.
    Now the "Nanhai No. 3" has been manufactured and is being tested in the field. These college students who grew up in the north and have never been to paddy fields are braving the summer heat in the south and continuing to fight alongside the commune members in the paddy fields. Three female students who grew up in Beijing found it difficult to move in the paddy fields when they first came to Dali. Some were afraid of leeches, but to help the commune realize agricultural mechanization and to make agriculture develop at a higher speed, they have become accustomed to all this and are selflessly working in the fields. After work, they also use their standard Beijing accents to teach commune members Pinyin literacy and Mandarin Chinese in the evenings.
    Although the teachers and students of the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College have only been here for more than three months, they have already completed more than 30 mechanization and semi-mechanization projects. When the members of the Dali Commune saw these energetic "supporters," everyone thought: Our commune's production will advance rapidly like a winged steed!

专栏：支援农业小故事

　　支援者
　　李凝
    广东省南海县大沥人民公社的社员，经常可以在村里、田头碰到许多面生的“客人”，他们有男的，也有女的，有头发花白的老人，也有年青小伙子，他们都是从四面八方来到农业前线的“支援者”。他们有的长期，有的短期，有的固定挂钩，有的临时突击，总之，为了加速农业建设，在这里忘我地工作着。
　　度周末的老教授
    一位头发花白的老人，每逢星期六下午来到大沥公社，到星期天下午又走了。他来到后，不是深入田间去观察生产情况，就是和公社的干部研究生产问题。
    这位深入田间度周末的老人，就是华南农学院副院长、防治病虫害专家赵善玖教授。大沥公社已经成了他第二个家了。今年早造，他来到这里，看到禾田由于天旱和一部分冬种作物因为没有来得及浸水，第一代螟虫正在盛发。他发现这种情况后，立即就和公社党委研究防治措施，在公社里掀起了群众性的防治螟虫热潮。为了帮助公社病虫害防治站的社员们提高技术，更准确地预报螟虫盛发和产卵时间，他又帮助社员们学习技术和有关知识，使群众防治螟虫的力量使在刀刃上，费力小，收效大，结果全公社早造禾田抽白穗的现象很少（在千分之一以下），保证了增产。
    土壤分析能手
    大沥公社的土壤分析能手陈庇开，是个挺出名的人物。这个小伙子过去只读过五年小学，然而他现在掌握的土壤知识却是惊人的。他不但掌握了在化验室内分析土壤的技术，而且在田野里能用肉眼鉴别几种不同的土壤，并且能提出不同的施肥和改良土壤办法。
    陈庇开的成长是和“支援者”的培养帮助分不开的。这个小伙子原来对土壤分析根本不感兴趣。1958年时，华南农学院和其他单位的科学工作者，固定和这里建立了联系，来这里帮助公社搞土壤鉴定。公社派陈庇开也来参加这一工作。那时，他和一些青年一样：“心早就飞到炼钢炉旁去了”，觉得这样在田里挖井取土样，再进行分析研究，简直是浪费时间。但是，华南农学院的师生们和其他单位的科学工作者，耐心地向他解释土壤分析对生产的重要意义，一遍又一遍地向他讲解有关土壤的科学知识。后来土壤鉴定完成了，陈庇开也变成个“土壤迷”。
    从此，陈庇开便刻苦地钻研有关土壤和肥料的知识，华南农学院师生和其他单位的科学工作者也不断到这里来帮助公社搞土壤普查、肥料规划，陈庇开继续向他们学习有关土壤知识。如今，陈庇开已经成为一个熟练的土壤分析能手了。3月间，全国土壤鉴定现场会议召开时，他和其他土壤分析能手们，当众作了快速分析土壤的表演。
    大沥公社在各科学单位的支援下，还大量培养了像陈庇开这样土生土长的各种科学技术人材。近两年来，就已经训练培养了气象员二百七十五人、拖拉机手一百零八人、土壤分析人材五百三十四人、插秧机手六千多人，还有一批汽车司机和机械化的人才。
      从北京来的人
    5月间的一个夜晚，已经十二时多了。在大沥公社机械厂的厂房里，还有一伙年轻人在那里奋战着。这是北京农业机械化学院派来的“支援者”。他们在这里正为公社设计制造一种适合水田耕作的新型绳索牵引机（电犁）——南海三号。
    这天晚上，这些大学生们忙着把角钢锯开，制造电犁机架。大沥机械厂里没有电锯，他们就用手锯来锯，到半夜时，手锯片也用完了，角钢还没有锯好，怎么办？停下来就会妨碍明天进行电焊，而制造电犁是一刻也不能停的。
      “用钢凿来截断它！”张民修同学一声建议，赵骥善、穆萍等男女同学立刻动手。他们抡起大铁锤，猛击钢凿，一点一点地把角钢截开。手扶钢凿的同学，手都震麻了，但大家还是一口气也不停地干，直到角钢截好为止。
    现在《南海三号》已经制好作实地试验了。这几个生长在北方从没有下过水田的大学生，又顶着南方夏天的炎日，在水田里继续和社员一起奋战。有三位在北京市长大的女同学，初来大沥时，下到水田行动很困难，有的见到水蛭就害怕，但为了帮助公社实现农业机械化，为了使农业以更高速度发展，她们已经习惯了这一切，在田野里忘我地劳动着。她们劳动之余，还利用晚上的时间，用她们的标准北京口音，教社员学注音识字和普通话。
    北京农业机械化学院的师生们，虽然到这里还只有三个多月时间，但他们已经完成的机械化、半机械化项目已经有三十多项。大沥公社社员们看到这些生龙活虎般的“支援者”，每个人的心里都想到：我们公社的生产将会像插翅的骏马一样，飞速地前进！
