    A New Sport Emerges
    Rocket Model Competition Held in Soviet Union

    A competition in a new technical sport, rocket modeling, was held in Krasnodar, Soviet Union. As a result of the competition, Gorbunov, a student from Krasnodar, won the first-class rocket championship. Shevchenko and Menyailenko won the second-class rocket and third-class rocket championships, respectively.
    Rocket model sports have recently gained increasing popularity in the Soviet Union, especially in the Kuban region. The competition held in the Krasnodar region included three events: first-class, second-class, and third-class rocket launches. The results were judged based on the accuracy of the rocket's trajectory, the altitude it reached, and the deployment of the rocket's parachute. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)
