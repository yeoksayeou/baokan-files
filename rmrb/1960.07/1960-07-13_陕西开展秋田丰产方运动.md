Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 12th: Shaanxi Province is launching a large-scale autumn field high-yield campaign to strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

In order to vigorously promote autumn field high-yields, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial high-yield field conference as early as April. At the end of May, when wheat was about to be harvested, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Liuqu People's Commune, Tongchuan City, with the participation of the first secretaries of the county (city) committees in Guanzhong, summarizing the experience of summer field high-yields and discussing plans and measures for vigorously promoting autumn field high-yields and next year's summer field high-yields. After the meeting, counties (cities) and communes also held meetings. A large-scale autumn field high-yield campaign was launched throughout the province. At present, the proportion of high-yield fields that have been planted or implemented in various places to the total crop area is: cotton accounts for 44%, corn accounts for 36.7%, rice in southern Shaanxi accounts for 64.8%, and millet in northern Shaanxi accounts for more than 30%. For late autumn crops, the area that has been implemented in counties such as Dali, Qianxian, Xingping, Pucheng, and Weinan accounts for 40% to 50%. These high-yield fields are generally large and contiguous, developing into an irrigation area, a river valley, or a mountain range.

In order to better implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward to arrange high-yield fields, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on "vigorously promoting high-yield fields for ten major crops," and unified the rational layout and appropriate proportions of high-yield fields for various crops. Various places have made arrangements in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, ensuring that large-scale crops such as wheat, cotton, and corn can vigorously promote high-yield fields, and also ensuring that oil crops, potatoes, beans, millet, and other crops can also vigorously promote high-yield fields. This ensures not only high yields this year, but also high yields next year. Pucheng County, based on its local conditions, has most of the production teams in the county's ten communes jointly establishing high-yield belts of wheat and cotton, and autumn crops, each accounting for 500,000 mu of rotation fields, so that wheat, cotton, and autumn fields have large high-yield fields, good stubble, and comprehensive high yields every year. At the same time, according to the specific conditions of various regions, communes, management districts, and production teams establish small high-yield fields for various crops.

At present, while stepping up field management of autumn high-yield fields, various places are vigorously promoting basic farmland construction in high-yield fields. In addition to deep plowing the land and applying sufficient base fertilizer in the autumn high-yield fields, various places are also vigorously promoting small-scale water conservancy construction in response to drought, and vigorously leveling more than 10 million mu of land for late autumn replanting and summer fallow land, and establishing fertilizer bases for high-yield fields.

Various places have universally established scientific research organizations such as command fields, experimental farms, and Red and Expert schools with the direct participation of cadres in autumn high-yield fields. Shiquan County has established 86 agricultural science research offices and 724 research groups in high-yield fields, with the participation of more than 25,000 people, achieving one agricultural science and technology personnel for every ten mu.

    陕西开展秋田丰产方运动
    丰产方占作物总面积的比例是：棉花44％，玉米36.7％，水稻（陕南）64.8％，糜谷（陕北）30％以上
    据新华社西安12日电　陕西省大规模开展秋田丰产方运动，争取秋季大丰收。
    为了大搞秋田丰产方，中共陕西省委早在4月就召开了全省丰产方会议；5月底小麦将要收割时，省委又在铜川市流曲人民公社召开了关中各县（市）委第一书记参加的现场会议，总结了夏田丰产方的经验，讨论大搞秋田丰产方和明年夏田丰产方的规划和措施。会后，各县（市）、各公社也都召开了会议。一个大规模的秋田丰产方运动就在全省展开。目前各地已经种植或落实的丰产方，占作物总面积的比例是：棉花占44％，玉米占36.7％，陕南地区水稻占64.8％，陕北地区糜谷占30％以上。晚秋作物，大荔、乾县、兴平、蒲城、渭南等县已经落实的面积占40％至50％。这些丰产田一般都是大块连片，发展到一个灌区、一条川、一架山。
    为了更好贯彻以粮为纲全面跃进的方针来布局丰产方，陕西省委曾发出“十大作物大搞丰产方”的指示，统一规划了各种作物丰产方的合理布局以及适当的比例。各地按照省委指示作了布局，既保证小麦、棉花、玉米等大宗作物能够大搞丰产方，也保证油料、薯类、豆类、糜谷等作物也能够大搞丰产方。既保证今年丰产，也保证明年丰产，蒲城县根据当地具体情况，全县十个公社的绝大部分生产队共同建立小麦和棉花、秋田等倒茬田各占五十万亩的丰产带，使小麦、棉花、秋田年年都有大块丰产田、都有好茬口、都能全面高产。同时，还根据各个地区的具体情况，由各公社、管理区和生产队，建立各种作物的小块丰产方。
    目前，各地在加紧秋田丰产方田间管理的同时，大搞丰产方的农田基本建设。各地在秋田丰产方里除把土地普遍进行了深翻，施足了底肥以外，还针对干旱大搞小型水利建设，大搞晚秋复种土地和夏季休闲地一千多万亩的土地平整，建立丰产方的肥料基地。
    各地在秋田丰产方里普遍建立了干部直接参加的指挥田、试验场、红专学校等科学研究组织。石泉县在丰产方里建立了八十六个农业科学研究室，七百二十四个研究组，参加研究的达二万五千多人，做到了十亩有一个农业科学技术人员。
