Xinhua News Agency, July 1st – Assi Camille Adam, Chairman of the National Liberation Committee of Ivory Coast, who is currently visiting China, told our agency's reporter in Beijing on June 30th: The National Liberation Committee of Ivory Coast will resolutely fight for the immediate and complete independence of Ivory Coast.

He pointed out that because the people of Ivory Coast firmly demanded independence, the government authorities had no choice but to make a request for "independence" to de Gaulle. However, he believes that this will not go beyond empty talk of independence, because the "independence" demanded by the authorities is only "independence" within the "French Community."

Adam said that after achieving genuine independence in Ivory Coast, the National Liberation Committee demands that power be held by the current oppressed—the broad masses of workers and peasants—and that democracy and freedom be restored.

Adam condemned the French colonialists, who have ruled Ivory Coast for more than a hundred years, for colluding with US imperialist capital in recent years to carry out horrific exploitation of the people of this West African country. They have opened many enterprises in Ivory Coast, almost completely controlling the main economic sectors of Ivory Coast such as coffee, cocoa and mineral extraction, soap manufacturing, timber, and oil.

He pointed out: "In Ivory Coast, the United States is replacing France. In fact, the United States is going there to gain complete domination." Adam said that currently, American investment accounts for 30% to 50% of most enterprises in Ivory Coast. In particular, the oil industry is almost completely monopolized by American capital; half of the investment in the construction of Ivory Coast's only dam is American. He also pointed out that according to a secret US-French military agreement, US imperialists and French colonialists will jointly use French military bases in Ivory Coast; not long ago, the US Department of Defense sent a representative to "visit" Ivory Coast.

Adam revealed that US imperialists and French colonialists are buying over some upper-class figures in Ivory Coast and supporting bureaucratic bourgeoisie as their political and economic agents in Ivory Coast.

He said that under the cruel exploitation of imperialist capital, the people of Ivory Coast live in extremely difficult conditions. Farmers are forced to sell agricultural products such as coffee and cocoa at low prices, while purchasing consumer goods imported from imperialist countries such as France and the United States at high prices. Urban workers, in addition to being exploited by high-priced consumer goods, also have to pay a large portion of their meager wages as income tax. He said that the people of Ivory Coast resolutely oppose these exploitations.

Adam pointed out that Africa and Asia have many things in common, so the people of these two continents should carry out the struggle against common exploiters together on the basis of complete mutual trust. He said that in order to safeguard world peace, US imperialism must withdraw from China's territory of Taiwan, from Japan, and must stop supporting France's rule in Africa.

Adam visited Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Sanmenxia and other places in China. He said: "I see that China is a great country with unlimited prospects. The Chinese people are building with full confidence and are always ready to oppose any aggression and defend their motherland." He said that he was deeply impressed by the Chinese people's struggle against the number one enemy, US imperialism.

Adam enthusiastically praised China's policy of walking on two legs in construction and the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward. He said that he personally saw the Chinese workers laboring with such enthusiasm and joy, because they knew that their labor was for the benefit of the people themselves. Adam said that this was in stark contrast to the melancholy expressions of the French workers he saw in Paris.

    象牙海岸民族解放委员会主席说
    象牙海岸人民要求真正独立
    谴责美帝国主义正取代法国奴役象牙海岸
    新华社1日讯　正在我国访问的象牙海岸民族解放委员会主席阿西·卡米尔·阿当6月30日在北京接见本社记者时说：象牙海岸民族解放委员会要为象牙海岸立即获得真正的、彻底的独立而坚决斗争。
    他指出，由于象牙海岸人民坚决要求独立，政府当局也不得不向戴高乐提出“独立”的要求。但是，他认为，这将不会超出空谈独立的范围，因为当局所要求的“独立”只是留在“法兰西共同体”内的“独立”。
    阿当说，民族解放委员会要求在象牙海岸获得真正独立后，由现在的被压迫者——广大的工、农群众——掌握政权，并恢复民主和自由。
    阿当谴责统治了象牙海岸一百多年的法国殖民主义者近年来勾结美帝国主义资本，对象牙海岸这个西非国家的人民进行了骇人听闻的剥削。他们在象牙海岸开设了许多企业，几乎完全控制了咖啡、可可和矿藏开采、肥皂制造、木材、石油等象牙海岸主要的经济部门。
    他指出：“在象牙海岸，美国正在取法国而代之。事实上，美国到那里去，就是为了取得完全的统治。”阿当说，目前在象牙海岸大部分企业中，美国投资已占30％至50％。特别是石油业，几乎完全由美国资本垄断；象牙海岸唯一的一座水坝建设的投资有一半是美国的。他还指出，根据美法一项秘密军事协定，美帝国主义者和法国殖民主义者将共同使用法国在象牙海岸的军事基地；不久前，美国国防部曾派一个代表去象牙海岸“访问”。
    阿当揭露美帝国主义者和法国殖民主义者正在象牙海岸收买当地一些上层人士，扶植官僚资产阶级，作为他们在象牙海岸政治上和经济上的代理人。
    他说，在帝国主义资本的残酷剥削下，象牙海岸人民生活异常困苦。农民被迫以低价出售咖啡、可可等农产品，而以高价购买从法、美等帝国主义国家进口的消费品。城市工人除受到高价消费品的剥削外，还要从微薄的工资中付出很大一部分所得税。他说，象牙海岸人民坚决反对这些剥削。
    阿当指出，非洲和亚洲有许多共同之点，因此这两大洲的人民应该在完全互相信任的基础上一起进行反对共同剥削者的斗争。他说，为了维护世界和平，美帝国主义必须从中国的领土台湾、从日本撤出去，必须停止支持法国在非洲的统治。
    阿当在我国参观访问了北京、上海、武汉、郑州、三门峡等地，他说：“我看到中国是一个前途无量的伟大的国家。中国人民满怀信心在进行建设，并随时准备着反对任何侵略、保卫自己的祖国。”他说，中国人民反对头号敌人美帝国主义的斗争使他有深刻印象。
    阿当热情地赞扬我国建设中两条腿走路的方针和大跃进的巨大成就。他说，他亲眼看到中国的工人们是那样热情、欢乐地劳动，因为他们知道他们的劳动都是为人民自身的利益的。阿当说，这与他在巴黎所见到的法国工人们的忧郁的神情形成了鲜明的对比。
