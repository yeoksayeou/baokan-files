Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 4th. The Tianjin Winch Factory has consistently emphasized improving product quality and expanding the variety of specifications, enabling the rapid development of winch production from small to large, and from low-grade to high-grade, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in the factory's work.

This factory was established in August 1958. In the past two years, it has developed from being able to produce only 10-horsepower and 15-horsepower small winches to being able to manufacture 50-horsepower large winches. Since the beginning of this year, the quality of all products has met standards. Due to the emphasis on product quality, the factory's products are generally welcomed by user departments. While product quality has improved, output has also increased significantly. By the end of June, the factory had completed 68.8% of its annual production plan, an increase of more than 150% compared to the same period last year.

Winches are indispensable lifting equipment for mines, steel enterprises, construction projects, etc. If an accident occurs due to substandard product quality, it will cause huge losses to the country. Therefore, the factory's Party General Branch Committee has always attached great importance to improving product quality and manufacturing more advanced new products with a high sense of responsibility to the country and user departments. When formulating production plans each month, product quality is taken as an important element, establishing the idea of quality first, and regularly educating employees on improving product quality. At the same time, a set of systems to ensure product quality has been established, combining professional inspectors and mass inspection by the vast number of employees, so that everyone is in charge of quality control. From the manufacture of the chassis and drums to the final assembly, a contract responsibility system has been established for each process of winch production. Each group in each workshop has also established amateur inspectors, selecting the most responsible workers to serve as inspectors. The components produced by the group are inspected by the inspectors, and after they are qualified, the production group leader stamps them, and then the workshop director does the final inspection. Each winch, after being assembled in the fitter's workshop, is inspected by the fitter's workshop director. After these checkpoints have been rigorously inspected and qualified, a three-hour test run is performed. It must be proven that the machine's performance, specifications, and other quality standards fully meet the requirements before it can be packaged and shipped.

The winch factory, based on the fact that its technical strength is weak and apprentices account for more than 70% of the workforce, has also focused on vigorously training and improving the technical level of workers to ensure continuous improvement in product quality. Each group in the factory has a technical class, learning what they do, and widely sign apprenticeship contracts, guaranteeing teaching and learning, so that the contradictions of the factory's large number of new workers, low technical level, and inability to guarantee product quality are quickly resolved. After a year and a half, most of the apprentices are now able to operate independently, and many have reached the level of first-grade and second-grade workers. This has played a significant role in ensuring product quality.

From the secretary and factory director to all cadres, the factory also conscientiously promotes the "one, two, three system" working method, spending at least three days a week participating in labor, leading production in a thorough, meticulous, and down-to-earth manner, and promptly discovering and solving problems, ensuring a comprehensive leap forward in product quality and various production indicators. After the cadres go deep into the front line of production, they adopt the "three fixed" methods of fixed time, fixed workshop, and fixed group machine tools, and apprentice themselves to the workers at the machine tools, familiarizing themselves with production and operating techniques, and further eliminating quality loopholes from all aspects. In the past, supply and marketing section cadres only purchased raw materials and materials according to plans and did not understand the use of production. After participating in labor, they discovered that the shortage of steel castings often affected the production of the next process. They proposed the suggestion of replacing steel castings with high-efficiency cast iron. After testing, not only was the quality fully qualified, but also raw materials were saved.

### 天津卷扬机厂发动群众提高技术保证质量  上半年产品质量全部合格

    天津卷扬机厂发动群众提高技术保证质量
    上半年产品质量全部合格
    新华社天津4日电　天津市卷扬机制造厂一贯重视提高产品质量和品种规格，使卷扬机的生产由小到大、由低级到高级迅速发展，促进了工厂全面工作大跃进。
    这个厂是在1958年8月建立起来的，经过两年的时间，就由只能生产十马力、十五马力的小型卷扬机发展到能够制造五十马力的大型卷扬机，今年以来各项产品质量全部合乎标准。由于重视产品质量，这个厂的产品普遍受到使用部门的欢迎。在产品质量提高的同时，产量也有了大幅度的增长。到6月底，全厂已经完成全年产量计划的68.8％，比去年同期增长一倍半多。
    卷扬机是矿山、钢铁企业、建筑工程等不可缺少的起重设备。这种设备如果因为产品质量不合要求，而发生了事故，就会为国家造成巨大的损失。因此，工厂的党总支委员会一直以对国家和使用部门高度负责的精神，重视提高产品质量和制造更高级的新产品。每月制订生产计划时，都把产品质量作为一项重要内容，树立质量第一的思想，并且经常向职工进行提高产品质量的教育；同时，建立起一套保证产品质量的制度，使专业检验人员和广大职工检验相结合，发动群众，人人把关。从制造底盘、滚筒一直到最后成装，生产卷扬机的每道工序都建立了包干责任制，各车间的每个小组还设立了业余检验员，挑选责任心最强的工人来担任。小组生产的部件由检验员检查合格后，交生产小组长盖章，再由车间主任总检验。每台卷扬机在钳工车间成装以后，再由钳工车间主任检验。经过这些关卡的严格检验合格后，最后还要试车三小时。证明机器的性能、规格等各项质量标准完全合乎要求，才能打包出厂。
    卷扬机厂根据本厂技术力量薄弱，徒工占70％多的情况，还从大力培养提高工人的技术水平入手，保证产品质量不断提高。全厂每个小组都有技术课，干什么，学什么，并且广泛订立师徒合同，包教包学，使工厂的新工人多、技术水平低、产品质量不能保证的矛盾迅速得到解决。经过一年半的时间，现在大部分徒工都已能单独操作，有不少达到了一级工和二级工的水平。这对保证产品质量起了很大作用。
    这个工厂从书记、厂长到全体干部，还认真推行了“一、二、三制”的工作方法，每周至少有三天时间参加劳动，深入细致、扎扎实实地领导生产，及时发现和解决问题，保证产品质量和各项生产指标全面跃进。干部深入生产第一线以后，采取了固定时间、固定车间、固定小组机床的“三固定”和包质量、包产量、包思想等办法，到机床拜工人为师，通过熟悉生产和操作技术，进一步从各个环节杜绝质量漏洞。供销科干部过去只是按照计划采购原料、材料，不了解生产用途，参加劳动后，就发现了铸钢件由于供应不足，常常影响下道工序的生产，他们就提出用高效铸铁代替铸钢的建议，经过试验，不仅质量完全合格，而且节约了原料。
