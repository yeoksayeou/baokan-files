Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 18th: A mass rally of 15,000 people in Pyongyang was held today at the open-air theater in Moranbong Youth Park to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

Among those attending the rally were Korean Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Jung Il-yong and Lee Joo-yeon, President of the Korean Academy of Sciences Baek Nam-woon, and leaders of various democratic political parties and social organizations. Phan The Huu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in Korea, was also invited to attend the rally.

The masses attending the rally constantly raised their arms and shouted slogans such as: "Support and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S.-Ngo clique!" "U.S. imperialism get out of South Korea and South Vietnam immediately! Get out of Asia and Africa!"

Song Young, member of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, chairman of the Korean Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and vice-chairman of the National Committee for the Defense of Peace, spoke at the meeting. He condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam. Song Young emphasized that without driving away U.S. imperialism and eliminating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the democratic freedom of the South Vietnamese people cannot be guaranteed.

Song Young said that U.S. imperialism is also the mortal enemy of the Korean people. It has turned South Korea into a living hell and continues to undermine the armistice agreement and aggravate the tension in Korea.

Song Young emphasized that the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is also a just struggle for Asian peace. The Korean people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is closely linked with the Vietnamese people's struggle. The Korean people warmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and support the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. He said that the U.S. imperialist-Ngo Dinh Diem clique must immediately stop the barbarous suppression of the South Vietnamese people, and U.S. imperialism must immediately get out of South Korea, South Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan.

Phan The Huu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in Korea, also spoke at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram to the Vietnam Women's Union, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary clique, for undermining the Geneva Accords and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The telegram pointed out that for several years, U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have repeatedly undermined the Geneva Accords, deliberately obstructing and sabotaging the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. They have implemented fascist terror rule in South Vietnam, cruelly persecuting and massacring former resistance personnel, patriotic people, and massacring large numbers of innocent residents, women and children. More seriously, U.S. imperialism has illegally transported large numbers of new weapons, military advisors, and military personnel into South Vietnam through the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," strengthening its criminal activities of expanding its army and preparing for war in South Vietnam, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina.

The telegram said that Chinese women fully support the solemn demands raised by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, which fully conforms to the interests and wishes of the Vietnamese people and women. We believe that in order to safeguard the peace of Indochina, it is necessary to resolutely stop U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, from continuing to undermine the Geneva Accords, and stop U.S. imperialism's attempt to turn South Vietnam into its base of aggression. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people and women will surely drive away the U.S. aggressors, and the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland will surely achieve final victory.

    新华社平壤18日电　平壤市一万五千多人今天在牡丹峰青年公园露天剧场举行群众大会，支持越南人民反对美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团的斗争。
    参加大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相郑一龙、李周渊，朝鲜科学院院长白南云和各民主政党、社会团体的负责人。越南驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办潘世友也应邀参加了大会。
    参加大会的群众不断振臂高呼：“支持声援越南人民对美吴集团的斗争！”“美帝国主义立即从南朝鲜和南越滚出去！从亚洲和非洲滚出去！”等口号。
    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员、朝鲜对外文化联络委员会委员长、拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长宋影在会上讲了话。他谴责了美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团在南越的罪行。宋影强调说，不把美帝国主义赶走，不清除吴庭艳集团，南越人民的民主自由就得不到保障。
    宋影说，美帝国主义也是朝鲜人民的死敌，他把南朝鲜变成了人间地狱，并继续破坏停战协定，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。
    宋影强调说，越南人民反对美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团的斗争也是为了亚洲和平的正义斗争。朝鲜人民进行的反对美帝国主义的斗争是同越南人民的斗争紧密地联系在一起的。朝鲜人民热烈支持越南人民反对美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团的斗争，支持越南民主共和国政府和平统一祖国的立场。他说，美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团必须立即停止对南越人民的野蛮镇压，美帝国主义必须立即从南朝鲜、南越、台湾、日本滚出去。
    越南驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办潘世友也在会上讲了话。
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会在日内瓦协议签订六周年的前夕，致电越南妇女联合会，坚决支持越南人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳反动集团破坏日内瓦协议，为实现祖国和平统一的英勇斗争。
    电文指出：几年来，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团，一再破坏日内瓦协议，蓄意阻挠和破坏越南的和平统一。它们在越南南部实行法西斯恐怖统治，残酷地迫害和残杀前抗战人员、爱国人士，并大批屠杀无辜的居民和妇女儿童。更严重的是美帝国主义竟通过“美国军事援助顾问团”把大批的新式武器、军事顾问、军事人员，非法地运进越南南部，加强它在越南南部进行扩军备战的罪恶活动，严重地威胁着印度支那的和平。
    电文说，中国妇女完全支持越南范文同外长给日内瓦会议两位主席信中所提的严正要求，这是完全符合越南人民和妇女的利益和愿望的。我们认为，为了维护印度支那的和平应当坚决制止美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团继续破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，制止美帝国主义企图把越南南部变成它的侵略基地的阴谋。我们坚信越南人民和妇女，一定能赶走美国侵略者，越南人民为实现和平统一祖国而进行的正义斗争，一定会取得最后的胜利。
