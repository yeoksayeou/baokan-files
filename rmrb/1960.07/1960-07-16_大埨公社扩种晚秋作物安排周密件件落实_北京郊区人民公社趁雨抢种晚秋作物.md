    Da Lun Commune Meticulously Arranges and Implements Late Autumn Crop Expansion
    Beijing Suburban People's Communes Seize Opportunity to Rush Plant Late Autumn Crops
    (This report) According to our newspaper, the Da Lun People's Commune Party Committee in Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, adheres to the principle of taking grain as the key, making comprehensive arrangements, and widely planting high-yield and high-return crops. While strengthening field management of early autumn crops, it organizes large and small team cadres and veteran farmer representatives to go deep into the fields, row by row, to clear stubble, and plans to plant 26,400 mu of late-late autumn crops, striving to expand the multiple cropping index.
    When the commune Party committee proposed the requirement to expand the multiple cropping index, some cadres and masses had four fears: first, they feared there would be too much farm work and not enough labor; second, they feared the technical requirements were too high, making it difficult to plant and manage; third, they feared the land utilization rate was too high, leading to poor and infertile land; and fourth, they feared that late-late autumn crops would be harvested too late, easily damaged by frost, and affect autumn sowing time. The commune, large teams, and small teams respectively convened Party members, League members, activists, and veteran farmer representatives, meeting in the fields, inspecting the growth of early autumn crops on one hand, and estimating the maturity period based on the early and late sowing of early autumn crops, calculating the increased production of late-late autumn crops on the other. Last year, Shenyu Brigade planted 84 mu of carrots after harvesting early and mid-season rice, with an average yield of 2,364 jin per mu. Last year, the Unity Squad of the Yuejin Brigade planted 12 mu of millet after harvesting early corn, with a yield of 215 jin per mu. This year, the entire commune has 8,500 mu of early and mid-season rice and 9,000 mu of early corn. If all of it is planted with late-late autumn crops, calculating an average of 200 jin of grain per mu, 3.5 million jin of grain can be harvested. This alone is a considerable amount. Everyone also analyzed the favorable conditions this year: early autumn crops were sown early, so they will mature earlier; late-late autumn crops can be sown early, striving to be harvested before the frost period. This year, with electric irrigation, more labor can be allocated to concentrate on accumulating fertilizer. Through seeing, row checking, inspecting, calculating, and discussing, opinions were unified, and it was decided to expand the planting of late-late autumn crops.
    Through research, the entire commune rationally arranged the stubble, breaking the past routine of simply replanting carrots and buckwheat in soybean fields. It selected eleven crops suitable for autumn growth, and adopted intercropping, multiple cropping, and interplanting methods according to the growth characteristics of early autumn crops, making every effort to expand the area of ​​late-late autumn crops. Among them, sesame has been interplanted in 2,300 mu of peanut fields; corn and vegetables have been interplanted in 3,100 mu of sweet potato and taro fields; carrots have been planted in 5,000 mu of early and mid-season rice, early summer corn, and soybean fields, respectively, while 2,500 mu of radish, 4,000 mu of buckwheat, 2,500 mu of potatoes, 2,400 mu of late millet, and 1,600 mu of green manure have also been planted. Autumn miscellaneous beans have been planted in 1,500 mu of sorghum and late corn fields; onions have been transplanted in 1,000 mu of mint and tobacco fields, and Chinese cabbage has been planted in 500 mu after the early millet harvest. Through meticulous arrangement, the total area of late-late autumn crops (including cash crops and vegetables) in the entire commune can reach 26,400 mu, with a multiple cropping index of 286%, accounting for 86% of the total cultivated land, an increase of 41% compared to last year. Double cropping has been basically eliminated, triple cropping has been generally achieved, and quadruple cropping has been achieved in a few cases.
    After the area and varieties were determined, the entire commune immediately allocated 50% of its labor force, organizing a 4,500-person fertilizer accumulation team, divided into three lines, to prepare enough fertilizer for early autumn, late-late autumn, and autumn sowing. At the same time, 750 technical personnel were trained in batches, focusing on learning intercropping and interplanting operation techniques. The warehouses were also cleaned and seeds were exposed to the sun.
    Currently, the commune Party committee has formulated a calendar table of agricultural timing crops for harvesting, planting, and management before the "Autumn Equinox" and a crop stubble arrangement table; large and small teams have drawn planting distribution maps, stubble arrangements, and planting specification tables according to the squared mu pieces, and inserted signs in the fields according to the fields.
    (This report) According to our newspaper, today (the 15th) there has been widespread rainfall in various counties (districts) in the suburbs of Beijing. The commune members who are rushing to plant rice and sweet potatoes, and the more than 30,000-strong army of voluntary laborers, are greatly encouraged. They immediately accelerated their pace, advanced in the rain, and strived to realize the combat task proposed by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee on the 13th: work hard for five days to finish planting rice, and work hard for seven days to finish planting sweet potatoes.
    Rainfall was widespread on the 15th. As of 6:00 PM, the rainfall in general areas was about 30 millimeters. Shortly after the rain started, counties (districts) such as Huairou, Tongxian, and Changping, and many communes, immediately deployed combat tasks overnight. The laborers fighting in the fields of Shunyi County, amidst the thunder and lightning, put forward the encouraging slogan "Thunder is cheering us on, heavy rain is fueling us," and the number of people rushing to plant sweet potatoes in the rain increased sharply from 12,000 on the 14th to nearly 40,000 today. Several middle schools in Tongxian County organized more than 2,000 students on the 15th to brave the rain and go to various communes to help transplant rice seedlings. Cadres and statisticians of the Yongshun Production Team of Tongzhen Commune all went out and planted sweet potatoes with the commune members. In Liangxiang Commune of Fangshan County, where there had been no thorough rain, there was more rainfall on the 15th. The commune immediately mobilized more than 8,000 laborers to participate in the battle of leveling land, leveled 600 mu of vegetable fields in one day, and planted 450 mu of radishes.
    In the fields of various communes, a large number of cadres and commune members were fighting in the rain together on the 15th. Seeing the soaring enthusiasm of the voluntary labor force composed of workers, students, officers and soldiers, cadres, and urban commune members in the thunder and rain, the commune members' fighting spirit was even more high-spirited. According to the new situation of rainfall, the commune members of Chengguan Commune in Shunyi County decided to complete the planting task of 2,700 mu of sweet potatoes ahead of schedule on the 15th and 16th.

    大埨公社扩种晚秋作物安排周密件件落实
　　北京郊区人民公社趁雨抢种晚秋作物
    本报讯　江苏省泰州县大埨人民公社党委坚持以粮为纲、全面安排和广种高产多收的方针，在加强早秋作物田间管理的同时，组织大、小队干部、老农代表，深入田间，逐片逐?排茬口，规划出晚晚秋面积二万六千四百亩，力争扩大复种指数。
    当公社党委提出扩大复种指数的要求后，部分干群有四怕思想：一怕农活多，劳力安排不过来；二怕技术要求高，难种难管；三怕土地利用率大，要苦田瘦田；四怕晚晚秋收割迟，易遭霜打，又影响秋播时间。公社、大小队即分别召集了党团员、积极分子、老农代表，会师田头，一面检查了早秋作物的生长情况，一面按早秋播种的迟早推测了成熟期、算了晚晚秋作物的增产账。申余大队去年早中稻收割后种了八十四亩胡萝卜，每亩平均单产二千三百六十四斤，跃进大队团结小队去年早玉米收割后种了十二亩粟子，每亩产量二百一十五斤。今年全社共有早中稻八千五百亩，早玉米九千亩，如果全部种上晚晚秋，每亩平均以二百斤粮计算，能收三百五十万斤粮食，单这一笔账就可观了。大家又分析了今年的有利条件，早秋播种早，成熟也就早；晚晚秋可以早下种，争取在霜期以前收获。今年电力灌溉，还可以划出较多的劳力突击积肥。通过看、排、查、算、议，意见取得一致，决定扩种晚晚秋。
    通过研究，全社合理地安排了茬口，打破了过去单纯在黄豆田里复种胡萝卜、荞麦的常规，选择了适合于秋季生长的十一种作物，根据早秋生长的特点，采取套种、复种、间种的办法，千方百计扩大晚晚秋作物面积。其中，花生田套种芝麻的，已下种二千三百亩；山芋、芋头田间种玉米、蔬菜的，已下种三千一百亩；早中稻、早夏玉米、黄豆田分别种胡萝卜五千亩、麻萝卜二千五百亩、荞麦四千亩、马铃薯二千五百亩、晚粟子二千四百亩、绿肥一千六百亩；高粱、晚玉米田种秋杂豆一千五百亩；薄荷、烟草田插洋葱一千亩，早粟子收割后种大头菜五百亩。通过周密的安排，全社晚晚秋（包括经济作物、蔬菜）面积可达二万六千四百亩，复种指数达286％，占总耕地86％，比去年增加41％，基本消灭了两熟，普遍达到三熟，少数达到四熟。
    面积和品种确定后，全社即拿出50％的劳力，组织了四千五百人的积肥队伍，分三条线分别为早秋、晚晚秋、秋播准备好足够的肥料。同时，分批集训技术人员七百五十名，着重学习间种、套种操作技术。并清理仓库曝晒种子。
    目前，公社党委已制订了“秋分”以前的农时作物收、种、管日历表和作物茬口安排表；大、小队已按方整化的?片绘制了播种分布图、茬口安排和种植规格表，并按田插了牌。
    本报讯　北京郊区各县（区）今天（15日）普遍降雨。正在突击栽种稻薯的公社社员和三万多名义务劳动大军，群情振奋，立即加快步伐，趁雨前进，奋力实现中共北京市委在13日提出的战斗任务：大干五天种完水稻，大干七天栽完白薯。
    15日降雨普遍。截至十八时止，一般地区降雨三十毫米左右。开始降雨不久，怀柔、通县、昌平等县
  （区）和很多公社，即连夜具体部署战斗任务。战斗在顺义县田间的劳动者，在雷雨声中提出“雷声为我们助威，大雨给我们加油”的鼓动口号，冒雨抢种白薯的人数由14日的一万二千人猛增到今天的近四万人。通县县城的几个中学，15日也组织了两千多名学生，冒雨赴各公社帮助插秧。通镇公社永顺生产队的干部、统计员等全部出动和社员们一起栽种白薯。一直没降透雨的房山县良乡公社，15日降雨较多，这个公社立刻调集了八千多名劳动力参加平整土地的战斗，一天整了六百亩菜地，种萝卜四百五十亩。
    在各公社的田间，15日都有大批干部和社员们一起冒雨战斗。社员们看到由工人、学生、官兵、干部、城市公社社员组成的义务劳动大军在雷雨中的冲天干劲，斗志更加昂扬。顺义县城关公社的社员根据下雨的新情况，决心把两千七百亩白薯的栽种任务提前在15、16两天完成。（附图片）
