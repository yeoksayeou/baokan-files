Comrades:

    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the 200 million young people of the country, I warmly congratulate the convocation of the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers and extend my highest respect to all literary and art workers for their hard work. This conference is being held in a new situation in which socialist construction in our country is continuing to leap forward and the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism is rising to an unprecedented height. Through this conference, all literary and art workers will surely unite more closely under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promote the development of China's literary and art cause, and make greater contributions to the great cause of socialism and communism.

    In recent years, especially since 1958, China's socialist literature and art, under the brilliant light of the General Line, following the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers as instructed by Chairman Mao and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," has victoriously carried out the struggle between the two roads and two ideologies of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and achieved great achievements. An unprecedented situation of a hundred flowers blooming, colorful and vibrant, popularization and improvement has emerged. A contingent of literary and art workers with the working class as its backbone is growing and expanding; a batch of outstanding works combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism have been created, shaping many images of people's heroes with communist style that are loved and welcomed by the broad masses of people, especially by millions of young people; it is especially gratifying that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary veteran cadres have directly participated in literary and artistic creation activities, writing a large number of shining works such as new folk songs, factory histories, commune histories, and revolutionary memoirs, adding glory to China's literature and art. China's literature and art has increasingly become the cause of the working people themselves, a new proletarian literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and becoming, as Chairman Mao said, "an army that is indispensable for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." All these achievements are a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the Party's literary and art policy.

    China's literature and art is a very important weapon for educating the people with socialist and communist spirit. Young people are the most enthusiastic readers and audiences of literature and art, treating revolutionary literature and art as their good teachers and helpful friends, drawing spiritual strength from it. Many young people have received profound class education from revolutionary literature and art, seeking examples to learn and imitate from the heroic images depicted in the works, learning how to contribute their strength to promoting socialist revolution and socialist construction. Revolutionary literature and art guides young people to embark on the road of revolutionary struggle, inspires their revolutionary enthusiasm, helps them establish a proletarian world outlook, and cultivates them into heroic fighters for the cause of communism. Proletarian literature and art is an indispensable component of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Conversely, bourgeois literature and art serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, using reactionary viewpoints, various individualistic thoughts, and decadent lifestyles to poison young people, guiding them away from the current political struggles, eroding their revolutionary will, and corrupting their moral character, in order to maintain and consolidate the sinful capitalist system of exploitation. At present, imperialism and its lackeys, the modern revisionists, are doing their best to peddle their bourgeois literary and artistic goods, spreading the poison of bourgeois pacifism and bourgeois hypocritical "humanitarianism" as an important means of salvaging the decaying rule of the bourgeoisie and plotting a "peaceful victory strategy" to restore capitalism in socialist countries. Many facts have proved that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the field of literature and art is very sharp. The target of bourgeois literary and artistic poisoning is primarily the youth. As long as imperialism exists in the world, and as long as the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie exists in socialist countries, young people may be subject to the erosion of bourgeois ideology. It is completely wrong to believe that young people in socialist society are born with socialist ideas, thus denying the necessity of carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, and abandoning or relaxing the socialist and communist education of young people. In order to ensure the complete victory of the proletarian dictatorship and the Party's absolute leadership over the younger generation, it is necessary to hold high the banner of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie in literature and art and the entire ideological field, and resolutely fight imperialism and its running dogs, the modern revisionists, to the end.

    Literature and art plays a great role in cultivating the moral character of young people. Using literary and artistic weapons to greatly enhance the communist ideological consciousness and moral character of young people and cultivate a new generation of communists is a noble and serious task facing our literary and art workers. With the vigorous development of socialist construction in our country and the advent of the cultural revolution upsurge, young people are being influenced by literature and art more and more widely and deeply. A novel, a poem, a revolutionary memoir can be published in tens or millions of copies; a film can have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of young viewers. The work of writers, actors, painters, musicians, photographers, etc., is by no means a personal matter, but an educational undertaking related to the healthy growth of thousands of young people. Whether to educate the people with socialist and communist ideas, and whether to launch an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideas, is the most important criterion for measuring the achievements of literary and art work. We believe that comrades in the literary and art circles will do their work with a high sense of political responsibility as revolutionary fighters, relying closely on the leadership of the Party and the strength of the collective, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, create more and better literary and artistic works for the young people of the whole country, and at the same time, effectively strengthen the work of literary and artistic criticism and reading guidance, helping the broad masses of young people learn to use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and improve their ability to analyze literary and artistic works from ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Our Communist Youth League organizations must strengthen close cooperation with the literary and art circles and work together to promote the growth of the communist spiritual outlook and moral character of the younger generation.

    Now, our country's proletarian literary and art contingent is growing stronger day by day. The new forces of literature and art are emerging from among the young people of our country in a continuous stream. Under the leadership and care of the Party and the hard cultivation of the older generation, they are growing rapidly. Facts have proved that to be a true literary and art worker who is beneficial to the people, one must first be a proletarian revolutionary. To this end, young literary and art workers must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. In particular, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" will always have great guiding significance for young literary and art workers. Some people think that young literary and art workers only need to learn literary and artistic knowledge and artistic skills, and whether or not they study Marxism-Leninism is unimportant. This argument can only lead young people astray and is very harmful. Because throughout the transition period, the struggle between the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, always exists, even young literary and art workers who have grown up in socialist society, if they neglect the study of political theory, relax ideological transformation, and deviate from struggle and the masses, may also become prisoners of bourgeois ideology and embark on the wrong path. Only by arming themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can young literary and art workers establish a firm political direction, master the correct method of observing the world, reflecting reality, and conducting artistic practice, and become proletarian literary and art fighters who are both red and expert.

    Going deep among the workers and peasants and participating in labor training is the fundamental way to transform the world outlook and obtain the source of creation. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, many young literary and art workers have gone to the countryside and factories, gone deep into the grassroots, participated in actual struggle and physical labor training, and practiced eating, living, working, and consulting with the workers and peasants, thus achieving gratifying achievements in political ideology and art. Conversely, without revolutionary practice, without the ideological feelings of sharing the same breath and destiny with the workers and peasants, it is impossible to create revolutionary literary and artistic works. Young literary and art workers have not been working for long, and their knowledge of class struggle and production struggle is relatively lacking, so it is even more important to go deep among the workers and peasants to participate in actual struggle training. This is not only an urgent task for doing a good job in literary and artistic creation, but also a long-term plan for cultivating a new army of young literary and art workers. We hope that young comrades engaged in literary and artistic work will not be satisfied with the preliminary achievements they have already made, and should wholeheartedly go to the workers and peasants, become one with the workers and peasants, train themselves, transform themselves, and unswervingly advance on the correct path of making literary and art workers workers and peasants.

    Comrades, the current domestic and international situation is very favorable for the continued leap forward of our country's literary and art cause. Imperialism is declining and collapsing, and the victory and awakening of the people of the world are developing rapidly; our motherland's socialist cause is continuing to leap forward. In this great era, everywhere is full of exciting struggles, and everywhere there are heroic figures who are high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. Under this excellent situation, comrades in China's literary and art circles will surely use literature and art as a powerful weapon of struggle to enhance the morale of the people and destroy the prestige of the enemy, severely crack down on the aggressive policies and war policies of U.S. imperialism, thoroughly expose the conspiracies and tricks of modern revisionists, enthusiastically sing the praises of the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed people for liberation, sing the praises of the three red flags of socialist construction in our country, sing the praises of our hardworking and brave people, sing the praises of the great creative talents of the people, sing the praises of the people's spirit of daring to think and act, being firm and unwavering, not fearing difficulties, and constantly revolutionizing, and sing the praises of the people's communist lofty style and moral character, create more outstanding works worthy of our great era, and climb the new peak of proletarian literature and art. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, China's literature and art will surely play a huge role in promoting the lofty task of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy" and realizing socialism and communism.

    促进年轻一代共产主义精神面貌的成长
    共青团中央书记处书记杨海波在全国文艺工作者代表大会上的祝词同志们：
    我代表中国共产主义青年团中央委员会，代表全国二亿青少年，热烈地祝贺中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会的召开，并向辛勤劳动的全体文学艺术工作者致以崇高的敬意。这次大会，是在我国社会主义建设继续跃进，全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争空前高涨的新形势下召开的。通过这次会议，全体文学艺术工作者必将在毛泽东思想的红旗下，更紧密地团结起来，推动我国文学艺术事业的发展，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业做出更大的贡献。
    几年来，特别是1958年以来，我国的社会主义文学艺术，在总路线的光辉照耀下，遵循着毛主席指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向和“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，胜利地进行了无产阶级和资产阶级两条道路、两种思想的斗争，取得了伟大的成就，出现了历史上从来没有过的百花盛开、万紫千红、大普及、大提高的局面。一支以工人阶级的文学艺术工作者为骨干的文学艺术队伍正在成长和壮大起来；创作了一批又一批革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的优秀作品，塑造了许多受到广大人民特别是千百万青少年的热爱和欢迎的、具有共产主义风格的人民英雄的形象；尤其可喜的是广大工农群众、革命老干部直接参加了文学艺术的创作活动，写出了大量的新民歌、工厂史、公社史、革命回忆录等光芒四射的作品，为我国文学艺术增加了光彩。我国的文学艺术，已经日益成为劳动人民自己的事业，成为为工农兵服务的崭新的无产阶级的文学艺术，成为像毛主席所说的“团结自己，战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队”。所有这一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都是党的文艺方针的伟大胜利。
    我国的文学艺术是用社会主义、共产主义精神教育人民的一个十分重要的武器。青少年又是文学艺术的最热情的读者和观众，他们把革命的文学艺术当作良师益友，从中吸取精神力量。许多青年从革命的文艺中受到深刻的阶级教育，从作品所描写的英雄形象中寻找自己学习和模仿的榜样，学习着怎样为促进社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。革命的文学艺术，引导青年们走上革命斗争的道路，激发他们的革命热情，帮助他们树立无产阶级的世界观，培养成为共产主义事业的英雄战士。无产阶级的文学艺术，是无产阶级革命事业的不可缺少的组成部分。与此相反，资产阶级的文学艺术，则为资产阶级的利益服务，用反动的观点、形形色色的个人主义思想和腐朽的生活方式去毒害青年，引导他们脱离当前的政治斗争，消磨他们的革命意志，败坏他们的道德品质，以达到维持和巩固罪恶的资本主义剥削制度的目的。目前，帝国主义及其奴仆现代修正主义者，竭力兜售他们的资产阶级文艺货色，散布资产阶级和平主义和资产阶级虚伪的“人道主义”的毒素，作为挽救资产阶级的腐朽统治，以及阴谋在社会主义国家复辟资本主义的“和平取胜战略”的一个重要手段。许多事实证明了，在文学艺术领域中，无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争是十分尖锐的。而资产阶级文艺的毒害的对象首先是青年。只要世界上还存在着帝国主义，只要在社会主义国家内还存在着资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，青年就有受到资产阶级思想侵袭的可能。那种认为在社会主义社会的青年，生来就会有社会主义的思想，因而否认进行政治思想战线上的社会主义革命的必要性，放弃或放松对青少年进行社会主义、共产主义的教育，那是完全错误的。为了保证无产阶级专政的彻底胜利，保证党对青年一代的绝对领导，就一定要在文学艺术和整个意识形态领域中高举兴无灭资的旗帜，同帝国主义及其走狗现代修正主义坚决斗争到底。
    文学艺术在培养青少年的道德品质上有很大的作用。运用文艺武器，来极大地提高青少年的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质、培养共产主义的新一代，是摆在我国文艺工作者面前的一个崇高而严肃的任务。随着我国社会主义建设的蓬勃发展和文化革命高潮的到来，青少年们受到文学艺术的影响越来越广泛、越来越深入了。一本小说、诗歌、革命回忆录，能够发行数十、数百万册；一部电影，拥有几千万以至上亿的青少年观众。作家、演员、画家、音乐家、摄影家等的工作，决不是什么个人的事情，而是关系到千千万万青少年健康成长的教育事业。是不是用社会主义、共产主义思想教育人民，是不是同资产阶级思想展开毫不调和的斗争，这是衡量文艺工作成绩的一个最重要的标准。我们相信文艺界的同志一定会以革命战士的高度的政治责任心来做好自己的工作，紧紧依靠党的领导和集体的力量，认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，为全国青少年创作出更多更好的文艺作品，同时切实加强文艺批评和读书指导的工作，帮助广大青年学会用马克思列宁主义的观点来分辨香花与毒草，提高分析古今中外文艺作品的能力。我们共青团组织一定要加强和文艺界的密切协作，共同努力来促进年轻一代共产主义精神面貌和道德品质的成长。
    现在，我国的无产阶级文艺队伍日益壮大起来了。文学艺术的新生力量从我国青年中间源源不断地涌现出来，他们在党的领导和关怀下，在老一辈的辛勤培植下，正在迅速成长。事实证明：要做一个真正的有益于人民的文艺家，首先必须是一个无产阶级的革命家。为此，青年文艺工作者必须认真学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作。特别是毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”对青年文艺工作者永远具有伟大的指导意义。有人认为青年文艺工作者只要学习文艺知识和艺术技巧，学不学马克思列宁主义是无关紧要的。这种论调只能引导青年走入歧途，是非常有害的。因为在整个过渡时期，无产阶级和资产阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争始终是存在着的，即使在社会主义社会里成长起来的青年文艺工作者，如果忽视政治理论的学习，放松思想改造，脱离斗争，脱离群众，也可能成为资产阶级思想的俘虏，走上错误的道路。青年文艺工作者只有用马克思列宁主义、用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能确立坚定的政治方向，才能掌握观察世界、反映现实和进行艺术实践的正确方法，成为一个又红又专的无产阶级的文艺战士。
    深入工农群众，参加劳动锻炼，是改造世界观和取得创作源泉的根本道路。大跃进以来，在党的领导下，已经有很多的青年文艺工作者下乡下厂，深入基层，参加实际斗争和体力劳动的锻炼，实行和工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，因而在政治思想上和艺术上都取得了可喜的成就。相反的，如果没有革命的实践，没有和工农群众同呼吸，共命运的思想感情，就不可能创作出革命的文艺作品来。青年文艺工作者参加工作时间还不久，阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识还比较缺乏，因而深入工农参加实际斗争锻炼就显得更加重要。这不仅是搞好文艺创作的当务之急，而且是培养青年文艺新军的百年大计。我们希望从事文艺工作的青年同志们不要满足于已经取得的初步成就，应当全心全意地到工农中去，和工农打成一片，锻炼自己，改造自己，在文艺工作者工农化的正确道路上坚持不懈地前进。
    同志们，目前国内外形势对我国文学艺术事业的继续跃进非常有利。帝国主义正在没落崩溃，全世界人民的胜利和觉醒正在迅速向前发展；我们祖国的社会主义事业正在持续不断地跃进。在这个伟大的时代里，到处充满着激动人心的斗争，到处有斗志昂扬、意气风发的英雄人物。在这种大好形势下，我国文艺界的同志，一定会运用文艺这一有力的斗争武器，长人民的志气，灭敌人的威风，狠狠地打击美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，彻底地揭穿现代修正主义者的阴谋诡计，热情地歌颂被压迫人民争取解放的革命斗争，歌颂我国社会主义建设的三面红旗，歌颂我们勤劳勇敢的人民，歌颂人民的伟大创造才能，歌颂人民敢想敢干、坚定不移、不怕困难、不断革命的精神，歌颂人民共产主义的崇高风格和道德品质，创造出更多的无愧于我们伟大时代的优秀作品，攀登无产阶级文学艺术的新高峰。我们相信，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国的文学艺术在“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”，实现社会主义和共产主义的崇高任务中一定能够发挥巨大的促进作用。
