　　Xinhua News Agency, July 17th -- According to the Press Trust of India, on the 16th in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh, one thousand railway workers holding a strike rally clashed with the police. The police attempted to disperse the workers with iron-clad clubs, and the workers retaliated with stones and soda bottles. The police arrested 140 of the strikers. According to the "Times of India," more than eighty people were injured in the clash.

　　The official Indian Information Service revealed on the 16th that in many places, government employees in postal and telecommunications, railway, civil aviation, and defense institutions were continuing their strike. According to materials from the employees' strike leadership cited by the Press Trust of India, the government has arrested more than 15,000 people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 17th -- According to the official Indian Information Service, the members of the Joint Action Committee of Central Government Employees' Unions, who were not arrested by the government, which led the large-scale strike of Indian government employees, met with some union representatives in New Delhi late on the 16th and decided to end the five-day-long strike. According to reports in New Delhi newspapers today, the end to the strike is unconditional.

　　According to today's "Statesman," Asoka Mehta, chairman of the Praja Socialist Party, who had just returned from a visit to the United States, made "untiring efforts" for this decision to end the strike. On the 16th, he held discussions with Prime Minister Nehru, Labor Minister Nanda, and Transport and Communications Minister Subbarayan. The Joint Action Committee that led this strike of government employees had a total of twelve members, most of whom have been arrested by the government. The general secretary of the Joint Action Committee and others are all members of the Praja Socialist Party.

　　According to the official Indian Information Service, Praja Socialist Party Chairman Mehta told reporters after the Joint Action Committee made the decision to end the strike that he was pleased with the cancellation of the strike. The Press Trust of India reported: Mehta also told reporters that he did not ask Prime Minister Nehru and Labor Minister Nanda to provide guarantees, nor did he discuss any conditions for ending the strike. The Press Trust of India had reported a few days ago that Mehta, after returning to Mumbai from the United States on the 11th, immediately issued a statement on the government employees' strike, saying that "as far as the Praja Socialist Party is concerned, the current large-scale strike is purely a trade union issue." On the 15th, he also said in Mumbai that his efforts were to "bridge the gap between the government and the employees." Newspapers said that since returning from the United States, he has been busy studying the possibility of ending the government employees' strike. Today's "Statesman" said that the strike leaders ended the strike "not as a result of negotiations, but based on their own independent assessment of the situation and a decision made after consultation with Mehta."

　　According to today's "Times of India" in reporting the Joint Action Committee's resolution to end the strike, the government has arrested more than 15,000 people.

　　印度政府逮捕了一万五千多罢工者
　　政府雇员罢工领导机构决定停止罢工
    新华社17日讯　据印度报业托辣斯报道，16日在安得拉邦的锡康达腊巴德，一千名举行罢工集会的铁路工人同警察发生了冲突。警察企图用包铁皮粗杖来驱散工人，工人用石头和汽水瓶进行还击。警察逮捕了其中的一百四十名罢工者。据“印度时报”说，在这场冲突中一共有八十多人受伤。
    官方的印度新闻处16日透露，在不少地方的邮电、铁路、民用航空和国防机构中，仍有政府雇员在继续罢工。据印度报业托辣斯引用雇员罢工领导机构的材料说，政府已经逮捕了一万五千多人。
    新华社17日讯　据官方的印度新闻处消息，领导这次印度政府雇员大罢工的、中央政府雇员工会联合行动委员会中没有被政府逮捕的委员，16日深夜在新德里同一些工会代表开会决定停止已经持续五天的罢工。据今天新德里各报报道，停止罢工是无条件的。
    据今天的“政治家报”说，刚从美国访问回来的人民社会党主席阿索卡·梅达，为这个停止罢工的决定“作了不倦的努力”。16日他曾同尼赫鲁总理、劳工部长南达和交通运输部长苏巴拉延等进行了商谈。这次领导政府雇员罢工的联合行动委员会，一共有十二名委员，大多数委员都已经被政府逮捕。联合行动委员会的总书记等都是人民社会党人。
    据官方的印度新闻处报道，人民社会党主席梅达在联合行动委员会作出停止罢工的决定后对记者说，他对撤消罢工这件事感到高兴。印度报业托辣斯报道：梅达还对记者说，他没有要求尼赫鲁总理和劳工部长南达提出保证，也没有讨论过取消罢工的任何条件。印度报业托辣斯前几天已经报道，梅达11日在从美国回到孟买后，马上就政府雇员罢工问题发表了一篇声明，说“就人民社会党来说，目前的大罢工是纯粹的工会问题”。15日他又在孟买说，他的努力就是“弥合政府和雇员之间所出现的鸿沟”。报纸说，他从美国回来后一直在忙于研究结束政府雇员罢工的可能性。今天的“政治家报”说，罢工的领袖们结束罢工“不是谈判的结果，而是根据他们自己对情况的独立估计以及同梅达协商后作出的决定。”
    据今天的“印度时报”在报道联合行动委员会关于停止罢工的决议时透露，政府已经逮捕了一万五千多人。
