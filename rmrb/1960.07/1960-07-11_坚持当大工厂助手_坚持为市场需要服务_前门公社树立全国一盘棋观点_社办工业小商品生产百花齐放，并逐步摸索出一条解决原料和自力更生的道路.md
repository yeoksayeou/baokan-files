　　Commune-Run Industrial Small Commodity Production Blossoms, Gradually Exploring a Path to Solving Raw Material Problems and Self-Reliance

　　(Our Newspaper Reporter Sun Shikai Reports) Factories affiliated with the Qianmen People's Commune in Beijing are actively developing the production of daily-use small commodities, playing a role of "picking up the leftovers and filling the gaps" in the field of production, both supplementing the shortcomings of large-scale industry and supplying the needs of the market.

　　This commune has eighteen factories, distributed in the streets and alleys east of Qianmenwai Road. Arriving here, one immediately discovers its production characteristics. In the courtyard of the commune's bead-threading processing factory, more than eighty production personnel carefully make beaded hair clips, some grape-shaped and some butterfly-shaped. In other factories, some are pasting envelopes and making masks, while others are making eyeglass frames and magnifying glasses. As long as there are raw materials, they produce whatever the market needs. Of the more than fifty products currently produced by the entire commune, most are daily-use small commodities and processed goods for large factories. Recently, some factories have been continuously increasing the production of daily-use small commodities according to market needs, and adding new designs and varieties to supply the growing needs of the people's lives. After the commune's hardware factory began accepting a batch of small commodity production tasks delegated by Zhengyang Hardware Factory in April, it extracted more than sixty people to form a small hardware workshop, specializing in the production of awl hoops, fire pokers, fire tongs, and fire hooks. Beginning in June, this factory added new products, including slate erasers for elementary school students and paper clips for office use. The production of shoe eyelets requires three or four processes to produce finished products, and two eyelets are only worth one or two li of money, but they did not refuse to produce these commodities because of their low output value and high labor cost. According to market needs, they arranged double production tasks in June, increasing from a monthly output of 1,000 jin in the past to 2,000 jin. Now the factory's shoe eyelet output accounts for more than one-third of the city's needs. Some factories that do processing work for large factories also mostly process various small commodities. At present, the commune's medicine packaging factory is concentrating its efforts on packaging various daily-use medicines for summer, with more than two hundred women participating in the production, packaging 1.5 million bags of Rendan, 1 million bags of Wuji Dan, and 12 million bags of Baochi San per month, supplying the needs of the market.

　　The small commodity production of this commune is developed by means of "large leading small" in the process of processing for large factories. In addition to widely utilizing the offcuts and waste materials of large factories, this commune is also linked to waste product companies, and often obtains recycled waste materials as raw materials. The commune's sewing factory has been using waste materials to make gloves since March. In May alone, it bought back more than 1,300 jin of rags and waste fluff strips from waste product companies, making 4,350 pairs of various gloves, and has now begun processing insoles. Some factories also take the initiative to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials in every possible way. When producing eyeglass frames, the commune's eyeglass processing factory lacked plexiglass. Without the guidance of technicians, the production personnel gave full play to their spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and built a plexiglass melting furnace themselves, experimenting with using the remaining scraps and offcuts of their own factory to replicate plexiglass, exploring a path of self-reliance to solve the raw material problem.

　　The Qianmen People's Commune, in developing industrial production, has undergone a series of ideological struggles to adhere to the production direction of "being an assistant to large-scale industry and serving the market." In developing small commodity production, some managers of commune-run factories believed that "this kind of production is neither famous nor profitable," with low output value and little accumulation, and that it would be better to engage in products with high output value. For example, the output value plan of the commune's cardboard box factory in May was raised from a monthly output value of 30,000 yuan in the past to 50,000 yuan. In order to achieve this high output value, they reduced the various cardboard boxes that they had been producing and switched to making higher-output-value coated paper products. After discovering this problem, the commune's Party committee immediately conducted discussions, criticized the erroneous thinking of blindly pursuing output value, and rationally adjusted their output value plan, ensuring that they continued to produce various cardboard boxes for some factories and enterprises. The Party committee of this commune believes that this is a division of labor in the socialist economic undertaking. The commune's production undertaking, organized by idle labor in the city, must first consider the city's needs for scattered daily-use commodities and processing services for large-scale industry, so that larger industries can free up their hands to produce other products urgently needed by the country. The production undertaking of urban communes must also have a "national perspective" and must not simply pursue output value. Under the clear ideological guidance of the commune's Party committee, many factories in this commune that produce and process small commodities have always adhered to this production policy. Although the beaded hair clips processed by the commune's bead-threading processing factory only have a processing fee of a few cents each, they have never interrupted production since they started processing them in August 1958. The products are constantly being refined, the output is gradually increasing, and there are now nearly a hundred styles of hair clips, which not only meet the needs of the market, but also complete a part of the export commodity tasks.

　　坚持当大工厂助手　坚持为市场需要服务
　　前门公社树立全国一盘棋观点
　　社办工业小商品生产百花齐放，并逐步摸索出一条解决原料和自力更生的道路
    本报讯　记者孙世恺报道：北京市前门人民公社所属工厂积极发展日用小商品生产，在生产领域中起了“拾遗补缺”的作用，既补充大工业的不足，又供应了市场的需要。
    这个公社现有十八个工厂，分布在前门外路东的街巷里。一来到这里，立刻就发现它的生产特点。在公社穿珠加工厂的大院里，八十多名生产人员细心地做着穿珠发夹，有葡萄形的，也有蝴蝶形的。在另外一些工厂里，有糊信封和做口罩的，也有做眼镜架和放大镜的。只要有原材料，市场需要什么，它们就生产什么。全公社现在生产的五十多种产品，其中大部分是日用小商品和为大工厂做的加工品。最近，有的工厂根据市场的需要，日用小商品的产量不断增加，并且增添花色品种，供应人民生活日益增长的需要。公社五金工厂从4月开始接受正阳五金厂下放的一批小商品生产任务后，抽出六十多人组成一个小五金车间，专门生产锥子箍，火筷子、火通条、火钩子。6月开始，这个厂又增加了新产品，有小学生用的石板擦，有办公用的插纸千。他们生产的鞋汽眼，要经过三、四道工序才能出成品，而两个汽眼只值一两厘钱，但是他们并没有因为这些商品的产值低费工多而不去生产。他们根据市场的需要，在6月安排了加倍的生产任务，由过去月产一千斤增加到两千斤，现在这个工厂的鞋汽眼产量已占全市需要量的三分之一还强。有些工厂为大工厂做加工活，也多是加工各种小商品。现在，公社的包药厂正集中力量赶包各种夏季日用药，二百多名参加生产的妇女每月包出仁丹一百五十万袋、无极丹一百万袋、保赤散一千二百万袋，供应市场的需要。
    这个公社的小商品生产是以大带小，在为大厂加工过程中发展起来的。这个公社除广泛利用大工厂的下脚料、废料外，还和废品公司挂上了钩，经常得到回收的各种废料作原料。公社缝纫厂从3月开始就一直利用废料做手套。仅5月份从废品公司买回破布、废绒条一千三百多斤，做出各种手套四千三百五十副，现在又开始加工鞋垫。有些工厂还自己动手千方百计地克服原材料不足的困难。公社眼镜加工厂在生产眼镜架时，缺乏有机玻璃，生产人员在没有技术人员指导的情况下，发挥敢想敢干的精神，自造一座有机玻璃熔化炉，试验用本厂剩下的零碎的下脚料，复制出有机玻璃，为解决原材料问题摸索出一条自力更生的途径。
    前门人民公社在发展工业生产中，坚持“作大工业的助手，为市场服务”的生产方向，是经过一番思想斗争的。发展小商品生产，有些社办工厂的管理人员认为“这种生产既无名又无利”，产值低，积累又少，不如搞些产值高的产品，如公社纸盒厂5月份的产值计划由过去的月产值三万元提高到五万元。为了达到这个高产值，他们减少了过去一直生产的各种纸盒，改做产值较高的表厚纸活。公社党委发现这个问题后，立即进行了讨论，批判了盲目追求产值的错误思想，合理调整了他们的产值计划，保证继续为一些工厂企业生产各种纸盒。这个公社的党委认为，这是社会主义经济事业的一种分工，由城市闲散劳动力组织起来的公社生产事业，必须首先考虑到城市对零星日用商品的需要和为大工业加工服务，这样才能使较大的工业腾出手来生产国家迫切需要的其他产品。城市公社的生产事业同样要有“全国一盘棋”的观点，决不能单纯追求产值。在公社党委的这种明确的思想指导下，这个公社许多生产和加工小商品生产的工厂，一直坚持这个生产方针。公社穿珠加工厂加工的穿珠发夹虽然每个只有几分钱的加工费，但是，他们从1958年8月开始加工以来，从来没有间断过生产，产品精益求精，产量逐渐上升，发夹的样式现已近百种，不仅满足了市场的需要，还完成了一部分出口商品的任务。
