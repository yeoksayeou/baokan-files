    Manage and Cultivate Young Forests Well
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the people's communes, China's afforestation efforts have developed rapidly. In 1958 and 1959, the total afforestation area nationwide reached more than 500 million mu. This spring's afforestation area has also increased even more compared to the same period last year. The continuous increase in the area of newly planted young forests requires that the work of tending these young forests must closely follow. In the past, some regions often showed great enthusiasm for afforestation but paid insufficient attention to the nurturing and management work after afforestation, resulting in a very low survival rate. This not only wasted some seedlings and labor but also affected the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, delaying the pace of greening. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate promoting the nurturing of young forests with the same vigor as afforestation, and to ensure planting and management are combined to guarantee survival. The Liwu Town People's Commune in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, built canals to store water, constructed machine wells, and established pig farms in its high-yield forestry plots. These are positive measures. Young forests with irrigation and fertilization conditions, or where irrigation can be achieved through effort, should strive to implement irrigation and fertilization to promote rapid growth and high yields.

    Since the beginning of this year, many rural people's communes have established commune-run forestry farms and organized specialized teams engaged in forestry production, creating extremely favorable conditions for strengthening the work of nurturing young forests. All localities should make full use of these favorable conditions, actively carry out the work of nurturing young forests, and also make full use of the gaps in agricultural production to organize the broad masses to carry out concentrated campaigns, so that fixed professional teams and short-term concentrated efforts can closely cooperate. Only in this way can we truly manage and cultivate young forests well. This year, Linxian County in Henan Province achieved a afforestation survival rate of over 95% because it closely coordinated professional teams and mass short-term campaigns.

    The season for tending young forests is also the busy season for agriculture, and labor is tight. How to closely coordinate the tending of young forests with agricultural production, ensuring both agricultural production and the successful completion of young forest tending work, is the key to whether young forest tending work can be done well. In recent years, various localities have explored an experience in their actual work that is worth greatly promoting, that is, vigorously carrying out intercropping of forests with grain. Planting crops such as grain and oilseeds in young forest land not only nurtures the young forests but also yields grain and oil, which is a good way to combine the long-term interests of forestry production and the current interests of agricultural production. Facts have proved that young forests where intercropping of forests with grain has been implemented have not only produced a lot of grain and other agricultural products but have also greatly accelerated the growth rate of trees. Last year, Pengxi County in Sichuan Province intercropped forests with grain on more than 200,000 mu, producing more than 16 million jin of grain, and at the same time enabled most of the young forests to be nurtured, improving the afforestation survival rate. This spring, Chun'an County in Zhejiang Province intercropped various crops on more than 60,000 mu of young forest land, and it is estimated that this year it can produce more than 90,000 dan of grain, oilseeds, etc., saving more than 260,000 labor days, and the afforestation survival rate generally reaches over 95%.

    At present, China has hundreds of millions of mu of newly planted young forests. These young forests will be China's new forest resources. All localities should seize the time, make full use of all favorable conditions, and conscientiously carry out the work of nurturing young forests, striving to achieve that every tree is strong and every area becomes a forest, and struggle to build a new forestry production base.

    把幼林管好育好
    本报评论员
    大跃进以来，特别是人民公社化以后，我国的造林事业有了飞跃的发展。1958和1959两年全国造林总面积即达五亿多亩，今年春季造林面积又比去年同期有了更大的增长。新造幼林面积的不断增加，就要求幼林抚育工作必须紧紧地跟上来。以往，有些地区常常是搞造林时劲头很大，对造林后的抚育管理工作不够注意，以致造林成活率很低。这不仅造成部分树苗和劳力的浪费，而且会影响群众造林的积极性，推迟绿化的速度。因此必须提倡以造林的劲头来大搞幼林抚育，要作到栽、管结合保栽保活。河北省高阳县里吾镇人民公社，在林木丰产方中开渠蓄水，修筑机井，建立养猪场，这是积极的措施，凡是有灌溉施肥条件的幼林，或者经过努力可以做到灌溉的地方，都应当力争实行灌水和施肥，以促进林木速生丰产。
    今年以来，很多的农村人民公社建立起了社办林场，组织了专门从事林业生产的专业队伍，为加强抚育幼林工作创造了极为有利的条件。各地应当充分利用这一有利条件，积极开展幼林抚育工作，同时也应充分利用农业生产的间隙时间，组织广大群众大搞突击，使固定性的专业队伍和短期突击密切配合起来，这样才能真正把幼林管好育好。河南省林县今年由于作到了专业队伍和群众性的短期突击密切配合，造林成活率达到95％以上。
    幼林抚育季节正是农忙季节，劳力紧张。如何使幼林抚育和农业生产密切配合起来，既保证农业生产，又能很好完成幼林抚育工作，是能否搞好幼林抚育工作的关键。几年来各地在实际工作中摸索到了一条值得大大提倡的经验，这就是大搞林粮间种。在幼林地内种植粮食和油料等农作物，既抚育了幼林，又能收获到粮食和油料，是林业生产的长远利益和农业生产的当前利益结合的一种很好的办法。事实证明，凡是林粮间种的幼林，不但生产了很多的粮食和其他农产品，也大大加快了林木生长速度。四川省蓬溪县去年林粮间种二十多万亩，生产粮食一千六百多万斤，同时也使得大部分幼林得到了抚育，提高了造林成活率。浙江省淳安县今春在幼林地间种各种农作物六万多亩，预计今年可生产粮食、油料等九万多担，节省劳力二十六万多个，造林成活率普遍达95％以上。
    现在我国有几亿亩新造幼林，这些幼林将是我国新的森林资源，各地应当抓紧时间，充分利用一切有利条件，认真搞好幼林抚育工作，力争实现棵棵茁壮、片片成林，为建设新的林业生产基地而奋斗。
