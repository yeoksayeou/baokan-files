　  Resolution on Algeria

　  The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council met in Stockholm from July 9 to 11, 1960. The Standing Committee emphasized the worldwide significance and urgency of a peaceful solution to the Algerian question.

　  At a time when the irresistible movement of colonial peoples for national liberation is moving forward, the conscience of the people of all countries can only condemn the continued unjust war waged by French colonialists with the political and military support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The continuation of this war is a growing threat to universal peace.

　  The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pays tribute to the heroic struggle of the Algerian people, whose suffering and sacrifice have moved the world and made their natural right to independence sacred.

　  The Standing Committee expresses its admiration for the growing efforts of the forces of peace in France and throughout the world to establish a just peace.

　  The Standing Committee believes that peace can be restored quickly, as both sides have accepted the principle of achieving a peaceful solution through negotiations on the basis of self-determination.

　  The Standing Committee notes with satisfaction that the first step has been taken towards negotiations. However, the Standing Committee regrets the breakdown of the Melun talks. The Standing Committee believes that genuine negotiations should be based on free discussion between both parties on an equal footing, and that any unilaterally imposed conditions should be excluded.

　  Such negotiations cannot and must not separate the two logically closely related issues: ceasefire conditions; conditions and guarantees for the implementation of self-determination.

　  The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council calls on all forces striving for peace to intensify their efforts and take concrete measures to ensure that negotiations between the French government and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria are resumed quickly.

　  Finally, the Standing Committee requests the United Nations Organization to use its authority to seek the peaceful and just solution that the people of the world expect.

　  关于阿尔及利亚的决议
    世界和平理事会常委会1960年7月9日到11日在斯德哥尔摩开会，常委会强调指出和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的世界性意义和紧急性。
    值此殖民地人民争取民族解放的不可抗拒的运动向前推进的时候，各国人民的良心只能谴责法国殖民主义者在北大西洋公约组织的政治和军事支持下继续进行这场非正义的战争。这场战争的继续，是对普遍和平的日益增长的威胁。
    世界和平理事会常委会向阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争致敬，他们遭受的痛苦和牺牲，已感动了全世界，并使得他们获得独立的天赋权利成为神圣的了。
    常委会对于法国和全世界的和平力量为了建立公正的和平而作的越来越大的努力表示敬佩。
    常委会认为，和平是能够很快恢复的，因为双方都已经接受了在自决的基础上通过谈判来取得和平解决的原则。
    常委会满意地注意到，已经向谈判迈出了第一步。但是，常委会对于默伦会谈的破裂表示遗憾。常委会认为，真正的谈判应该以双方在平等基础上自由讨论为前提，而且要排除任何片面强加的条件。
    这种谈判不能、而且必须不把逻辑地密切联系着的两个问题分开来：停火条件；执行自决的条件和保证。
    世界和平理事会常委会呼吁一切争取和平的力量加紧努力，并采取具体措施，以便使法国政府和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府之间迅速重开谈判。
    最后，常委会要求联合国组织运用它的权威，来谋求全世界人民所期待的和平和公正的解决。
