    Cultivating Technical Strength at High Speed and with High Quality
    He Zuo
    China's vocational and spare-time education is developing rapidly. On the one hand, efforts are being made to eliminate the remaining illiteracy, and on the other hand, it has entered the stage of vigorously running higher education. The rapid development of vocational and spare-time education has created favorable conditions for vigorously training technical workers and technical cadres to meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in China's industrial production.
    Spare-time higher education in various places has made great progress in quantity and is also well-run in quality. This shows that spare-time universities can not only be established, but also be run well. Many university students trained by spare-time higher education institutions have blossomed and borne fruit in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement because they have studied well and combined learning with application, playing the role of technical backbones. Some graduates have even reached the level of engineers. This also shows that vocational and spare-time higher education can cultivate workers' own engineering and technical talents who are both red and expert at high speed and with high quality. Some people once believed that it is a good thing for workers to learn culture, but it is very difficult to master theoretical knowledge at high speed and with high quality and become new technical forces who are both red and expert. Of course, there are difficulties. But difficulties can not only be overcome, but also be transformed into smoothness through teaching reform. The reason is that the difficulties they are talking about only start from the workers' relatively poor cultural level and lack of basic theoretical knowledge, so they think there are "roadblocks" in learning. They did not start from the workers' long-term practice and rich practical knowledge, so they did not see that in the learning process, workers can break through many theoretical knowledge with a single point, understand by analogy, learn well and use well. At the same time, workers have a high degree of class consciousness and a tenacious learning spirit. Therefore, they are fully equipped with the conditions to learn quickly and learn well. As long as we start from the actual level of the workers, from the actual production of the factory, break the old system and use new methods in teaching, put forward different requirements and make different arrangements according to different needs and different objects, and carry out teaching reform, we can give play to favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, and achieve the goal of cultivating technical strength at high speed and with high quality.
    At present, vocational and spare-time higher education institutions in many places have adopted various methods to continuously reform the academic system, teaching materials and teaching methods, and many good teaching systems, teaching materials and teaching methods have begun to emerge. In the process of implementing the policy of "combining production, unified arrangement, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity," Hebei Province has developed new and effective experiences in spare-time education. We must conscientiously summarize and promote the good experiences of spare-time education in various regions and industrial and mining enterprises, so as to accelerate the consolidation and improvement of vocational and spare-time education and prepare conditions for cultivating technical strength in a greater, faster, better and more economical way.

    高速度高质量地培养技术力量
    何作
    我国职工业余教育发展迅速，一方面正在继续抓紧扫除剩余文盲，另一方面已经进入大办高等教育阶段。职工业余教育这样地迅速发展，就为大力培养技术工人、技术干部，适应我国工业生产持续跃进的需要创造了有利条件。
    各地业余高等教育，在数量上有了很大发展，在质量上也办得很好。这说明业余大学不仅可以办起来，而且能够办得好。许多业余高等学校培养出来的大学生，由于学习得好，学用一致，所以都能在技术革新和技术革命运动中开花结果，发挥了技术骨干的作用。有的毕业生且已达到了工程师的水平。这又说明，职工业余高等教育是能够高速度、高质量地培养出又红又专的工人阶级自己的工程技术人材的。有人曾经认为，工人学文化是好事，但是要高速度、高质量地掌握理论知识，成为又红又专的新的技术力量却有很大困难。当然，困难是有的。但困难不仅可以克服，而且经过教学改革，还可以化困难为顺利。原因是，他们所说的困难，只是从工人们文化水平较差、缺乏理论知识的基础出发，所以认为学习上有“拦路虎”。他们却没有从工人们经过长期的实践、有着丰富的实际知识出发，所以看不到工人们在学习过程中，对许多理论知识能够一点即破，触类旁通，学好用好。同时，工人们有高度的阶级觉悟，有顽强的学习精神，因而，他们充分地具备了学得快、学得好的条件。只要从工人的实际水平出发，从工厂的生产实际出发，在教学方面，大破旧体系，大用新方法，根据不同需要，不同对象，提出不同要求，作好不同安排，进行教学改革，就可以发挥有利条件，克服困难，达到高速度、高质量地培养技术力量的目的。
    现在，许多地方的职工业余高等学校已经采取了各种方法，不断改革学制、教材和教学方法，开始出现了许多好的教学制度、教材和教学方法。河北省在贯彻执行“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的方针过程中，发展了行之有效的业余教育的新经验。我们要认真总结和推广各地各工矿企业业余教育的好经验，从而加速巩固与提高职工业余教育，为多快好省培养技术力量准备条件。
