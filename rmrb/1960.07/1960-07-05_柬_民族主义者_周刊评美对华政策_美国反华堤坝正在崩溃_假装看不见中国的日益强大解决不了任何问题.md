Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 3rd. The Cambodian "Nationalist" weekly published an editorial on the 3rd, commenting on the failure of the American policy toward China.

The weekly said, "The most remarkable fact of this century—perhaps the most remarkable fact of many centuries—is undoubtedly the awakening of Asia, and prominent is of course the awakening of China and its 650 million people."

The weekly recalled, "In the early years of the Chinese Revolution, European and American 'experts' on the China question held extremely skeptical attitudes. 'China will always be China.' Famine, plague, floods, anarchy, are forever inseparable from China! But people had to face the obvious fact: China has changed, it has found ways of transformation from the initiative of the people and has become one of the world's largest powers."

The weekly said: "Faced with the strength of China, the 'free world,' first of all the United States—which is certainly not known for its political imagination—began to resort to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Japan-U.S. treaty, and the establishment of military bases everywhere, as a dam against China."

The weekly ridiculed all the operational deployments of these countries' "grand strategists." The weekly believes that the American approach "aroused Chinese national sentiment and national pride, thereby also contributing to an unprecedented and extraordinary leap forward."

The weekly pointed out that the failure of this American foreign policy in the past few months is obvious. The weekly said, "The strong opposition of the Japanese people to the Japan-U.S. military treaty, the tendency of the South Vietnam dam to collapse, and the situation in Laos, cannot help but make Washington seriously doubt and feel uneasy about the solidity of the anti-China dam built with so much material and money. People's China exists and is growing stronger. Closing your eyes and pretending not to see it does not solve any problem."

The weekly believes that "supporting the Chiang Kai-shek fraud is one of the most serious mistakes the West has made."

    柬“民族主义者”周刊评美对华政策
    美国反华堤坝正在崩溃
    假装看不见中国的日益强大解决不了任何问题
    新华社金边3日电　柬埔寨“民族主义者”周刊3日发表社论，评美国对华政策的失败。
    周刊说，“本世纪的最引人注目的事实——也许是许多世纪以来最引人注目的事实——无疑是亚洲的觉醒，而突出的当然是中国和它的六亿五千万人民的觉醒。”
    周刊回顾说，“中国革命的头几年，欧美的中国问题‘专家’们抱着极大的怀疑态度。‘中国永远是中国’。饥荒、瘟疫、水灾、无政府状态，是永远同中国分不开的！但是人们不得不面对明显的事实：中国已经改变了，它从人民的能动性中找到了变革的办法，成了世界最大强国之一。”
    周刊说：“面对着中国的强大，‘自由世界’，首先是美国——美国当然不是以具有政治上的想像力著称的——开始借助于东南亚条约组织、日美条约和在各地建立军事基地的办法，作为对付中国的堤坝。”
    这家周刊嘲笑这些国家的“大战略家们”的这一切作战部署。周刊认为，美国的做法“激起了中国的民族感情和民族自豪感，从而也助成了史无前例的异乎寻常的飞跃。”
    周刊指出，过去几个月中美国这种外交政策的失败，是有目共睹的。周刊说，
  “日本人民的强烈反对日美军事条约，南越这道堤坝的趋于崩溃，还有老挝的局势，都不免使得华盛顿对于花了那么大量的物资和钱财建立起来的反华堤坝的坚固性感到严重的怀疑和不安。人民中国存在着，而且日益强大。闭着眼睛当作不看见，是解决不了任何问题的。”
    周刊认为，“支持蒋介石的骗局，是西方所犯的最重大的错误之一”。
