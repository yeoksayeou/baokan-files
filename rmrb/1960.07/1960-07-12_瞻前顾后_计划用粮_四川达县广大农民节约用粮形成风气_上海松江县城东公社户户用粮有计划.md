Looking Ahead and Behind, Planning Grain Usage
　　Broad Masses of Farmers in Dachuan County, Sichuan Province, Develop a Habit of Economical Grain Usage
　　Every Household in Chengdong Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai, Plans Grain Usage
　　(Reported by this newspaper) After the harvest of spring grain in Dachuan County, Sichuan, the county focused on economical grain usage and meticulously arranged the lives of the masses after the harvest.

　　After the spring harvest in Dachuan County, each commune, centered on the public canteens, made full use of blackboard newspapers, radio broadcasts, and after-work heart-to-heart talks to carry out activities of "two comparisons, three talks, and one propaganda," namely: comparing to before liberation and to disaster years, talking about the benefits of public canteens, talking about the Party's concern for the lives of the masses, and publicizing various experiences and methods of planning and saving grain. This turned the arrangement of the lives of the masses into a mass movement. All public canteens in the county, at the request of the masses, formulated measures to save grain, and more than 90% of the commune members consciously made personal plans to save grain. Commune members generally established the custom of considering saving grain as glorious and wasting grain as shameful.

　　While vigorously advocating economical grain usage, all canteens in the county tried their best to ensure that commune members ate satisfactorily. After the wheat harvest, the county commercial bureau immediately transferred more than 600 chefs from restaurants in various market towns to more than 7,000 rural public canteens throughout the county to teach techniques for making wheat foods and to help rural cooks comprehensively improve their cooking skills. Now, all canteens in the county have a good combination of vegetables and grains, which saves grain, tastes good, and satisfies the masses.

　　Raising more pigs and growing more vegetables is an important part of ensuring good food and saving grain. More non-staple food not only increases the variety of dishes but also saves grain. Dachuan County's communes have consistently grasped this link. Currently, the canteens alone have more than 127,000 pigs, more than 260,000 small poultry and livestock, and more than 15,000 mu of vegetable plots. Recently, the canteens have also launched a campaign to grow hundreds of vegetable seedlings per person, growing summer vegetables in a big way. More than 90% of the canteens throughout the county have maintained a daily vegetable intake of more than three jin per person. The county also promoted water and animal-powered grain processing equipment, eliminating the waste caused by processing lagging behind and eating and using it randomly.

　　Recently, the county formed a life inspection team of 4,000 people. Teams, management areas, communes, and districts carried out mass inspections with each other, further promoting the custom of economical grain usage.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Chengdong Commune in Songjiang County, Shanghai, launched a mass movement for economical and planned grain usage during the summer harvest. Some cadres and commune members of this commune developed the idea of "eating more and eating refined food" in the face of the abundant harvest of summer crops with large area and high yield this year. Some production teams' canteens, thinking that there was more grain, did not resolutely implement the instruction to grow more vegetables.

　　The commune's Party committee attached great importance to the above situation and decided that a Party committee secretary should lead cadres to the Yangjing Production Team, which has always been economical in its use of grain, to summarize experience, and then hold an on-site meeting to educate all cadres and the masses in the commune. At the same time, the Party committee also organized propaganda teams to explain to the masses through oral speeches, ballads, radio broadcasts, and blackboard newspapers: the reason for using grain to look ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with abundance, long-term planning, and leaving room for maneuver.

　　After specific and detailed ideological education work, 5,900 of the 6,500 commune members in the entire commune made plans to save grain. In order to save grain, the entire commune used scattered land to rush to plant 1,100 mu of vegetables in a few days.

　　This commune is a rice-producing area and lacks experience in how to save grain when eating wheat after the summer harvest. The commune decided to train cooks in rotation to teach the techniques of making pasta and saving grain. (Attached photo)

　　四川达县广大农民节约用粮形成风气
　　上海松江县城东公社户户用粮有计划
    本报讯　四川达县小春粮食收获后，以节约用粮为纲，细致安排了丰收后的群众生活。
    达县小春丰收后，各公社曾以食堂为中心，充分利用黑板报、广播、工余谈心会等形式，开展了“二比、三讲、一宣传”的活动，即：比解放前、比灾年，讲公共食堂的好处、讲党对群众生活的关心、讲当前的大好形势，宣传计划、节约用粮的各种经验办法。这样就把安排群众生活变成了群众运动。全县所有的公共食堂都在群众要求下，制定了节约粮食的措施，90％以上的社员自觉地订了个人节约用粮计划，社员普遍树立了节约光荣，浪费可耻的风尚。
    在大倡节约用粮的时候，全县各食堂千方百计保证社员吃得满意。小麦丰收后，县商业局立即从各个集镇的餐厅抽调了六百多名厨师，到全县七千多个农村公共食堂去巡回传授做面食的技术，并帮助农村炊事员全面提高炊事本领。现在，全县各个食堂都是菜粮搭配得很好，既省粮，又好吃，群众又满意。
    多养猪、多种菜，是保证吃好吃省的重要环节，副食品多了，不但增加了菜饭花样，而且节约了粮食。达县各公社自始至终抓住了这一环，现在，全县仅食堂养猪就有十二万七千多头，小家禽家畜二十六万多只，菜地一万五千多亩。最近各食堂又开展了每人增种百窝菜运动，大种夏菜，全县90％以上的食堂一直保持每人每天吃菜三斤以上。全县还因地制宜地大搞水力畜力粮食加工设备，消灭了因加工赶不上而乱吃乱用的浪费现象。
    最近，全县组成了一支包括四千人的生活检查团，队与队、管理区与管理区、公社与公社、区与区，互相之间开展了群众性的大检查，更进一步发扬了节约用粮的风气。
    本报讯　上海市松江县城东公社在夏季丰收中，开展群众性的节约用粮计划用粮运动。这个公社部分干部和社员在今年夏熟作物面积大、产量高的丰收年景面前，产生了“吃多、吃精”的思想。有些生产队的食堂，以为粮食多了，没有坚决执行多种蔬菜的指示。
    公社党委十分重视上述的情况，决定由一个党委书记带领干部深入一向节约用粮的洋泾生产队总结经验，然后召开现场会议，教育全社干部和群众。同时，党委还组织了宣传队，通过口头演讲、说唱、广播、黑板报等形式，向群众讲明：用粮要瞻前顾后，以丰补歉，细水长流，留有余地的道理。
    通过具体细致的思想教育工作之后，全公社六千五百户社员中有五千九百户订出节约用粮计划。为了节约粮食，全公社利用零星土地在几天内突击种蔬菜一千一百亩。
    这个公社是水稻产区，对夏收后吃麦怎样节约用粮缺乏经验。公社决定轮训炊事员，传授做好面食和节约用粮的技术。（附图片）
