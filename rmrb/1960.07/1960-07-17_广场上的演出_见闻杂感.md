Performances on the Square
　　——Observations and Reflections
　　Gu Ming

　　Chongqing has a system whereby, every weekend evening, traffic is stopped on the streets around the bustling Liberation Monument Square, and buses and trolleybuses detour far away. People walk back and forth in the middle of the road, even placing chairs and stools in the wide, flat center of the road, sitting down to enjoy the performances on the square. Here, they can often see performances not only by local theater groups and amateur troupes from various agencies, schools, and communes, but also by theater troupes from various places showcasing their best acts.

　　The open-air stage at Liberation Monument Square in Chongqing is very large, with stages both in front of and behind the monument, allowing two plays to be performed simultaneously, visible to people coming from all directions. Sometimes one side performs a play, while the other side shows a movie, allowing the audience to choose what they want to watch. Generally, performances start at eight o'clock and last until late at night. The programs are relatively short, one after another. One troupe performs, then another. Every weekend evening, there are five, six, or even ten or more troupes performing short but wonderful programs on this stage. People stay if they like it, and leave if they don't. Some pedestrians who didn't intend to watch become enthusiastic viewers after a glance and become engrossed.

　　Chongqing not only has open-air square performances at Liberation Monument, but also has such square stages in every district, suburb, rural commune, and urban commune. These scattered square stages have indeed greatly satisfied the people's growing cultural and recreational needs. They have also played a widespread, profound, and well-known role in coordinating current political struggles and daily propaganda and mobilization.

　　It is precisely because Chongqing has a good foundation in square performances and has formed a regular system that it has demonstrated its flexibility and combativeness in this "Week of Propaganda Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace," further making people realize that square performances are the most direct way to extensively reach the masses, delve into the masses, and connect with the masses. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the street play "Put Down Your Whip!" was performed on streets all over the country, greatly promoting the war effort. No matter where the play was performed, whenever the young worker jumped out from the audience and shouted, "Put down your whip!" preventing the old performing artist who had fled from the Northeast from whipping his poor daughter – Xiangjie, the audience on the street would also get excited, their emotions merging into one, making it impossible to distinguish who were the actors and who were the audience, thus achieving a huge propaganda effect.

　　In this anti-U.S. propaganda campaign, major and medium-sized cities across the country have also done many square open-air performances. During the performances, the stage and the audience sing together and roar slogans together, emotions completely merging into one. Thus, street square performances have once again played their unique role. This form of square street performance will surely, through this vigorous and enthusiastic propaganda climax, make everyone further realize its great role, so that it forms a regular system in places where conditions permit, persist in it, consolidate it, and develop and improve it, just like the square performances in Chongqing.

　　广场上的演出
　　——见闻杂感
　　顾明
    重庆有这末一个制度，每逢周末傍晚，在繁华的解放碑的广场周围的大街上，车辆便停止通行，公共汽车和无轨电车远远地绕道而行。人们在马路正当中穿来走去，还把椅子、凳子放在宽大平坦的马路正中，坐下来欣赏广场上的演出。他们在这里不仅经常能看到本地各个戏剧团体和各机关、学校、公社业余剧团的演出，并且能看到各地剧团带来的拿手好戏。
    重庆市解放碑露天广场舞台很大，碑前碑后都有舞台，可以同时上演两台剧，南来北往的人都可以看到。有时这面演戏，那面放映电影，观众爱看什么就看什么，完全由自己选择。一般是从八时开演直到深夜。节目都是比较短小的，一个接着一个，这个剧团演了那个演，每个周末晚上总有五、六个，甚至有十来个剧团在这舞台上演出简短而又精彩的节目。爱看就留，不看就走。也有本来不打算看的行人，一看之后就变成了热心的观众，看得入了迷。
    重庆市不仅在解放碑才有露天广场演出，在每个城区、郊区、农村公社和城市公社，都有这样的广场舞台。这些星罗棋布的广场舞台，的确大大满足了群众的日益增涨的文娱需要，在配合当前政治斗争和日常的宣传鼓动方面，也起了广泛深入、家喻户晓的作用。
    正是由于重庆市在广场演出这项工作上有良好的基础，并且形成了一种经常的制度，所以在这次“反对美帝侵略，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平宣传周”中，就显示了它的灵活性和战斗性，使人们更进一步地认识到广场演出是广泛地接触群众、深入群众、联系群众最直接的形式。抗战前《放下你的鞭子！》这个街头剧在全国各地街头演出，对抗战起了很大的推动作用。不管在什么地方演出这个戏，每当那个工人小伙子从观众中跳出来喊：“放下你的鞭子！”阻止东北流亡入关的卖艺老人鞭打他那可怜的女儿——香姐的时候，街头的观众也都激动起来，情绪溶一成片，分不清谁是演员谁是观众，因此收到巨大的宣传效果。
    在这次反对美帝宣传中，全国各大、中城市也都纷纷做了许多广场露天演出。在演出时台上台下一同唱歌、一同怒吼呼口号，情绪完全溶成一片。于是，街头广场演出又发挥出他的特有的作用。这种广场街头演出的形式，一定会通过这一次轰轰烈烈、热火朝天的宣传高潮，使大家更进一步认识到它的巨大作用，使它在有条件的地方都形成一种经常的制度，坚持下去，巩固起来，并且加以发展、提高，就像重庆市的广场演出那样。
