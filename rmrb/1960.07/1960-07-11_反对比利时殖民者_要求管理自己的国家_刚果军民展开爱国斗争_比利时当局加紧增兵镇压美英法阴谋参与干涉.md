Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Leopoldville Dispatch: Congolese soldiers demanding independent management of the Congo, along with groups of Congolese residents, shouted on the streets of the Congolese capital, Leopoldville, on the 8th: "Now is the time for Congolese to manage the Congo."

These soldiers demanded the removal of all Belgian colonial officers in the army. It is reported that in Leopoldville, army patrols are carrying out the orders of a Congolese sergeant who has been appointed commander of the Leopoldville army.

Jeeps, trucks, and armored vehicles carrying solely Congolese soldiers and police patrolled the streets of Leopoldville on the 8th. Many Congolese soldiers with rifles were stationed on the streets.

It is reported that Congolese soldiers in Leopoldville checked the vehicles of colonialists and confiscated their weapons. They and Congolese residents also demonstrated in front of the embassies of the most vicious imperialist country, the United States, and the consulates of the colonialist country of Portugal. When angry Congolese masses demonstrated in front of the American embassy, they protested the American embassy's hiding of a photographer who was carrying out nefarious activities in the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: The patriotic demonstrations held by soldiers of the newly independent African nation of Congo against Belgian colonialists have greatly shaken Western colonial countries led by the United States. On the one hand, they are frantically directing Belgian colonialists behind the scenes to step up armed suppression. On the other hand, they do not hesitate to openly come forward to intimidate and threaten the Congolese people.

According to the Associated Press, sources in London's diplomatic circles revealed last night that the United States, Britain, and France have issued a "joint appeal" to the Belgian government, urging it to quickly send troops to the Congo for suppression. The Associated Press said: "The news of the tripartite appeal to Belgium to send troops came almost simultaneously with the (Belgian) government's announcement of the following measures: the decision to send another 1,500 people from Belgium's troops in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Congo. These people have already begun their journey by plane."

A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed yesterday that the consulates of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy in Elizabethville had sent a note to the Belgian government requesting "military assistance."

It is revealed that Western colonial countries are planning to use the United Nations to interfere in the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 8th, diplomatic officials in London are discussing that if the anti-colonialist demonstrations of Congolese soldiers further develop, "the United Nations may take action – even intervene."

At the same time, the governments of Western colonial countries are openly threatening the Congolese people. U.S. State Department spokesman White said at a press conference on the 8th that the United States "is paying as close attention as possible to the situation there." He also threatened that the United States "is taking" all possible actions to ensure the "safety" of American citizens. There are reports that the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, which invaded Lebanon in 1958, has entered a state of "alert" and is ready to go to the Congo at any time.

It is reported that the Central African Federation under British colonial control has already amassed troops on the border with the Congo and is preparing to hold military "exercises" there.

The Portuguese colonial authorities have also dispatched three warships to "patrol" the sea only two nautical miles from the Congolese coast.

Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Amidst the large-scale struggle of Congolese military and civilians against Belgian colonialists, the Belgian government continues to blatantly increase troops in the Congo and carry out armed intervention.

According to reports from Brussels, Belgian troops stationed at the Kamina base in the Congo began suppressing the anti-colonialist struggle of Congolese military and civilians in Kabalo and other places on the 9th. It is reported that Belgium currently has a battalion stationed at this base. At the same time, after rushing two companies of infantry to the Congo on the 8th, the Belgian government will send two more infantry companies to the Congo on the 9th and 10th.

A spokesman for the Belgian Ministry of Defense revealed in Brussels on the 9th that the Belgian paratrooper reserve (approximately two battalions) had been ordered to report to various units for "service" in the Congo. Earlier reports said that Belgium already had 3,000 Belgian paratroopers stationed at its military bases in the Congo.

Reports say that Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny, in order to gather other imperialist countries to participate in the conspiracy to interfere in the Congo, shouted that the Congo is related to the interests of the "free world."

It is reported that at the same time, hundreds of Congolese residents demonstrated in front of the Belgian embassy on the 9th, protesting the Belgian authorities' conspiracy. In other parts of the Congo, more Congolese military and civilians have risen up to continue the struggle against Belgian colonialists.

According to Leopoldville reports, Congolese Prime Minister and Defense Minister Lumumba told Agence France-Presse reporters on the 9th that a group of heavily armed Belgian colonialists who attempted to assassinate him had been arrested in his residence. Lumumba also revealed that the Congolese government had also arrested dozens of armed Europeans. He said, "An investigation has begun into them for endangering national security."

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, July 8th: Two companies of Belgian troops are being sent to the Congo. The first batch left here by plane tonight.

The strength of these two companies is two hundred and forty people, and they were drawn from Belgian troops stationed in West Germany. They were all wearing combat uniforms when they boarded the plane, with steel helmets with camouflage nets and paratrooper camouflage jackets. Everyone carried automatic weapons.

The rest of these two companies will leave Brussels for the Congo on the morning of the 9th.

    反对比利时殖民者　要求管理自己的国家
　　刚果军民展开爱国斗争
　　比利时当局加紧增兵镇压美英法阴谋参与干涉
    新华社9日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：要求独立管理刚果的刚果士兵8日在刚果首都利奥波德维尔的街道上同成群的刚果居民一起高呼：“现在是刚果人管理刚果的时候了”。
    这些士兵要求撤换军队中所有比利时籍殖民军官。据报道，在利奥波德维尔军队的巡逻队正在执行一位刚果中士的命令，这位军人已经被任命为利奥波德维尔军队司令。
    载着完全是刚果的士兵和警察的吉普车、卡车和装甲汽车8日在利奥波德维尔大街上进行巡逻。许多刚果士兵拿着步枪在街头布岗。
    据报道，利奥波德维尔的刚果士兵在街上检查了殖民者的车辆和搜缴了殖民者的武器。他们同刚果居民还曾在最凶恶的帝国主义国家美国的大使馆和殖民主义国家葡萄牙的领事馆门前示威。愤怒的刚果群众在美国大使馆门前示威时，抗议美国大使馆隐藏一名在刚果进行恶劣活动的摄影记者。
    新华社10日讯　新近独立的非洲国家刚果的士兵所举行的反对比利时殖民主义者的爱国示威，使得以美国为首的西方殖民国家大为震动。它们一面手忙脚乱地在幕后指使比利时殖民主义者加紧进行武装镇压，一面又不惜公开出面，恫吓和威胁刚果人民。
    据美联社报道，伦敦外交方面提供消息的人士昨天晚上透露，美、英、法三国已经向比利时政府发出“联合呼吁”，要它赶快派军队前往刚果进行镇压。美联社说：“所传三国呼吁比利时出兵的消息，几乎是与（比利时）政府关于下列措施的宣布同时传来：决定从比利时在北大西洋公约组织的军队中再派遣一千五百人前往刚果。这些人已经开始乘飞机启程。”
    英国外交部发言人昨天证实，美、英、法、意四国驻伊利沙伯维尔的领事馆已经向比利时政府提出照会，要求给予
  “军事援助”。
    据透露，西方殖民主义国家正在策划利用联合国干涉刚果人民反殖民主义的斗争。据美联社8日从伦敦发出的一条消息透露，伦敦的外交官员正在谈论，如果刚果士兵的反殖民主义示威进一步发展，“联合国可能采取行动——甚至实行干涉”。
    同时，西方殖民主义国家的政府还公然向刚果人民进行威胁。美国国务院发言人怀特8日在记者招待会上说，美国“正在尽可能密切注意那里的局势”。他还威胁说，美国“正在采取”一切可能的行动来确保美侨的“安全”。有消息说，1958年曾侵入黎巴嫩的美国第二十四步兵师已进入“警戒”状态，准备随时开到刚果去。
    据报道，在英国殖民者控制下的中非联邦已经在同刚果接壤的边境集结军队，并且准备在那里举行军事“演习”。
    葡萄牙殖民当局也派出了三艘军舰，在距离刚果海岸只有两海里的海面上“巡逻”。
    新华社10日讯　在刚果军民掀起反对比利时殖民主义者的大规模斗争声中，比利时政府继续悍然增兵刚果，进行武装干涉。
    来自布鲁塞尔的消息说，比利时驻在刚果加米纳基地的军队9日已经在卡巴洛等地开始镇压刚果军民的反殖民主义斗争。据报道，比利时目前已有一个营驻在这个基地。同时，比利时政府继8日赶运两连步兵去刚果之后，9日和10日将再派两个步兵连去刚果。
    比利时国防部的一名发言人9日在布鲁塞尔透露，比利时的伞兵后备队（约两个营）已经奉命向各部队报到，以便在刚果“服役”。据早些时候的消息说，比利时在刚果的各军事基地上已经驻有三千名比利时伞兵。
    消息说，比利时外交大臣维尼为了纠集其他帝国主义国家参加干涉刚果的阴谋活动，曾叫嚷说：刚果关系到“自由世界”的利益。
    据报道，与此同时，数百名刚果居民9日在比利时大使馆前举行示威，抗议比利时当局的阴谋。在刚果其他一些地方，也有更多的刚果军民纷纷起来，继续进行反对比利时殖民者的斗争。
    据利奥波德维尔消息，刚果总理兼国防部长卢蒙巴9日向法新社记者说，一批武装到牙齿的比利时殖民者企图谋杀他，已经在他的住宅里被逮捕。卢蒙巴还透露，刚果政府还逮捕了几十名武装的欧洲人。他说，“已经开始对他们进行调查，他们的罪名是破坏国家的安全”。
    据新华社布鲁塞尔8日电　比利时军队两连人正在被派往刚果。其中第一批人今晚已经乘飞机离开这里。
    这两连人的兵力是二百四十人，他们是从比利时驻在西德的军队中被抽调出来的。他们在上飞机时都穿着战斗服装，带着有伪装网的钢盔，穿着伞兵穿的有伪装的上衣，所有的人都带着自动化武器。
    这两连人中其余的人将在9日清晨离开布鲁塞尔前往刚果。
