Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today demanding the immediate resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the holding of a general election by a caretaker cabinet.

The statement said that the people's demand for the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to step down is not to allow factional infighting within the Liberal Democratic Party to choose the next prime minister. The statement emphasized the need to hold a general election.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The "Security Treaty Criticism Association," composed of Japanese cultural figures, issued a statement today demanding that Nobusuke Kishi cease his conspiracies and step down immediately.

The statement pointed out that through the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the Japanese people have seen through the true colors of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the U.S. government, which have brought the "Cold War" to Japan and caused suffering to the people. The statement pointed out that the Japanese people's resolute struggle has forced Nobusuke Kishi to lose his footing. However, the Nobusuke Kishi group is still attempting to prolong its life and claims to suppress the people.

The statement demanded that Nobusuke Kishi step down immediately and dissolve the Diet. The statement also expressed opposition to suppression.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately one thousand workers from the Japanese National Railways and other industries continued to hold rallies and demonstrations in front of the National Railways Corporation building today, protesting the National Railways authorities' punishment of workers who participated in the patriotic struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the cancellation of plans to punish the workers.

The workers also sent ten representatives to lodge a serious protest with the National Railways authorities.

Socialist Party member of parliament, Koho Mitsuru, reported to the demonstrating workers on the talks between the delegation and the authorities. Koho said that under the delegation's strong questioning, the head of the National Railways Corporation was finally forced to admit that they were conspiring to punish the workers under the instruction of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

Chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, Yoshida Chuzaburo, emphasized in his speech that the struggle of the National Railway workers is a struggle of the Japanese people to safeguard peace and democracy. If the enemy dares to punish the National Railway workers, we will stand together with all the people and launch a resolute counterattack.

Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party, the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," the National Public Service Employees' Union, and the Private Enterprise Workers' Union spoke at the meeting, strongly condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to suppress the workers, and firmly stated that they would do everything in their power to launch a joint struggle to crush the conspiracy to suppress the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: In the gubernatorial election in Aomori Prefecture held yesterday, the Japanese democratic forces made significant progress in what is known as "the nation's foremost stronghold of conservative parties."

According to reports, the unified candidate of the democratic forces, Tanyū Yūzō, received 186,263 votes in the election, accounting for 38.7% of the total votes, an increase of approximately 46,000 votes compared to the 140,341 votes obtained by the democratic forces' candidate in the general election held in May 1958. Kyodo News said: The number of votes obtained by the democratic forces in various regions of the prefecture has "increased significantly" compared to the past. This news agency said: "Obtaining nearly 200,000 votes this time, and in Aomori Prefecture, which is known as the nation's foremost stronghold of conservative parties, is truly unprecedented."

The power of the Liberal Democratic Party has been greatly weakened in this prefecture. Its candidate, Yamazaki Iwao (the current governor), although using the ruling machine to obtain 295,198 votes and be re-elected as governor, saw his vote count decrease by approximately 84,000 votes compared to the general election held in May 1958. This was the first election held in Japan after the Nobusuke Kishi group illegally "ratified" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Kyodo News said that this election is considered a prelude to the upcoming general election. Therefore, this election has attracted special attention from all sectors of Japan.

The Japanese Communist Party took the initiative to withdraw its candidate in order to ensure the success of the Socialist Party candidate, Tanyū. During the campaign, the democratic forces worked together to expose the dangers of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and called on the people to strive to build a peaceful and neutral Japan. These calls elicited a positive response among the broad masses of voters. During the campaign, farmers in the prefecture established four new organizations opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The "Sankei Shimbun" commented on the Aomori Prefecture gubernatorial election, saying that the "Security Treaty" issue has had a great impact on farmers who previously supported conservative parties. In rural areas, the number of votes supporting democratic party candidates increased by 60% compared to the last general election.

Socialist Party Secretary-General Eda Saburō said yesterday that the results of the Aomori Prefecture gubernatorial election showed that through the struggle against the "Security Treaty," the political awareness of the Japanese people is improving. (Attached picture)

    坚决反对日美条约　不许自由民主党私相授受政权
    日本社会党要求成立看守内阁举行大选
    在保守政党根据地青森县举行日美条约“批准”后首次选举　民主力量得票大增
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，要求岸信介内阁立即总辞职，由看守内阁举行大选。
    声明说，国民要求岸信介内阁下台，并不是要让自由民主党内部的派系斗争来选择下届首相。声明强调必须举行大选。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：由日本文化界人士组成的“安全条约批判会”今天发表声明，要求岸信介停止阴谋活动，立即下台。
    声明指出，通过反对日美军事同盟的斗争，日本人民看穿了把“冷战”带给日本、使人民遭受痛苦的岸信介内阁和美国政府的真面目。声明指出，日本人民的坚决斗争已经迫使岸信介站不住脚了。但是岸信介集团仍然企图苟延残喘，并且声称要对人民进行镇压。
    声明要求岸信介立即下台，解散国会。声明并且表示反对镇压。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本国营铁道工人和其他各行业工人共约一千人今天继续在国营铁道公司大厦前面举行大会和示威，抗议国营铁道当局处罚参加反对新日美“安全条约”爱国斗争的工人，要求取消处罚工人的计划。
    工人们还派遣十名代表向国营铁道当局提出严重抗议。
    社会党议员河野密向示威的工人报告了代表团同当局谈话的情况。河野说，在代表团强烈的追究下，国营铁道公司负责人终于被迫承认，他们是在岸信介政府和自由民主党的指使下阴谋处分工人的。
    国营铁道工会委员长吉田忠三郎在会上讲话时强调指出，国营铁道工人的斗争，是日本人民为维护和平与民主而展开的斗争。敌人如果胆敢处罚国营铁道工人，我们将同全体人民站在一起，展开坚决的反击。
    日本共产党、“日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议”、国家公务人员工会和私营企业工人工会的代表分别在会上讲话，强烈谴责岸信介政府阴谋镇压工人，同时坚决表示将以全力展开共同斗争，来粉碎镇压工人的阴谋。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：在昨天举行的青森县知事选举中，日本民主力量在这个被称为“保守政党的全国首屈一指的根据地”获得了显著的进展。
    据报道，民主力量的统一候选人淡谷悠藏在选举中获得了一十八万六千二百六十三票，占总票数的38.7％，比1958年5月举行大选时民主力量候选人所获得的票数一十四万零三百四十一票，增加了约四万六千票。共同社说：民主力量在这个县的各个地区所得的票数都比过去“有很显著的增加”。这家通讯社说：“像这次获得将近二十万选票，而且是在被称为保守政党的全国首屈一指的根据地青森县，这真是史无前例的”。
    自由民主党的势力在这个县中大大削弱。它的候选人山崎岩男（现任知事）虽然利用统治机器获得二十九万五千一百九十八票，连任县知事，但是得票数目比1958年5月举行大选时减少了约八万四千票。这是岸信介集团非法“批准”日美军事同盟条约后日本举行的第一次选举。共同社说，这次选举被认为是即将举行的大选的一次前哨战。因此，这次选举引起了日本各界的特别重视。
    日本共产党为了使社会党候选人淡谷获得成功，主动地撤回了它的候选人。在竞选运动中，民主力量齐心协力地揭露了新日美“安全条约”的危险性，呼吁人民为建立和平与中立的日本而努力。这些呼吁在广大选民中引起了积极的反应。这个县的农民在竞选期间新建了四个反对新日美“安全条约”的组织。
    “产经新闻”在评论青森县知事选举时说，“安全条约”问题对过去支持保守政党的农民也产生了很大的影响。在农村，支持民主政党候选人的票数比上次大选增加了60％。
    社会党书记长江田三郎昨天发表谈话指出，这次青森县知事选举结果表明，通过反对“安全条约”的斗争，日本人民的政治觉悟正在提高。（附图片）
