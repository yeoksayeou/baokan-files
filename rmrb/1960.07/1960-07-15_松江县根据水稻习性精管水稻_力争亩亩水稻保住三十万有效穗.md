Songjiang County, Shanghai (From the Communist Party of China Songjiang County Committee Correspondence Group): Cadres in Songjiang County are taking the lead, with everyone participating, earnestly studying the growth and development patterns of rice, vigorously grasping field management, and attacking the tillering stage, striving for "300,000 effective panicles per mu of rice," to achieve the goal of large-scale, balanced production increase.

The mass research work on the panicle development stage of rice has achieved initial results. The CPC Songjiang County Committee, in the 10,000-mu high-yield rice plots, based on the experience of Chen Yongkang, a former Songjiang County agricultural labor model, in using the "Three Yellows and Three Blacks" (i.e., the process of late rice leaves changing three times from dark to light from transplanting to maturity), specifically summarized the "Six Character" experience for managing rice during the "Initial Yellow, Initial Black" stage. After discussion and refinement, it has proven to be a good experience to ensure 300,000 effective panicles per mu. Where it is resolutely and comprehensively implemented, rice seedlings tiller early and well, generally reaching 300,000 to 350,000 panicles. The specific contents of this six-character experience are: "One Diligence" means shallow water and diligent irrigation, frequent irrigation, keeping the water fresh, so that the rice roots are deeply rooted, the main stems are strong, and tillering is good; "Two Early" means supplementing seedlings and thinning seedlings early, filling in missing plants, balancing large plants with small plants, and supplementing small plants to ensure that there are enough basic seedlings per mu; "Three Seizing" means seizing the time to hoe rice. Farmers say, "Hoeing rice when it's yellow, hoeing weeds when they sprout." Early hoeing allows rice to grow new roots and tiller early, and also suppresses the weeds from rising; "Four Tight" means closely following hoeing with weeding, combined with pulling out all the barnyard grass; "Five Skillful" means skillful topdressing, matching fertilizer varieties well, and applying fertilizer based on field conditions, base fertilizer, and rice seedlings, using fertilizer where it is most needed; "Six Ruthless" means ruthlessly controlling pests, preventing pests when there are none, and treating pests when they appear, not allowing pests to raise their heads.

Since spring, under the guidance of the ideas of "30% planting, 70% management" and "managing early, managing well, and managing meticulously," the CPC Songjiang County Committee has regarded the study of the general laws of rice growth and development, improving cultivation and field management levels, and developing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture as a combat task and brought it to the attention of party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the county. After the task was put forward, the CPC Songjiang County Committee and cadres at all levels went deep into the grassroots. Through participating in production labor, on-the-spot observation and visiting commune members, holding forums, and summarizing the experience of last year's 1,000-jin high-yield rice fields, the following conclusions were drawn: On the basis of rational close planting, vigorously grasping the "water" and "fertilizer" keys, and timely weeding and hoeing, which promotes tillering (early stage) and controls tillering (late stage), ensuring that each mu of rice field has 300,000 effective panicles, then the yield per mu has the hope of reaching or even exceeding 1,000 jin.

Under the correct leadership of the County Party Committee, a mass movement to study the laws of rice growth and development and to talk about science in field management was quickly launched throughout the county. Nineteen 10,000-mu high-yield rice plots directly controlled by the County Party Committee and commune Party committees have established technical research committees, and have professional research groups for irrigation, topdressing, and pest and disease control, conducting special research. The county and commune's 10,000-mu high-yield rice plots have become command posts for field management. Production teams have technical research groups, and small teams have technical researchers. In this way, combining top and bottom, and driving at each level, a new situation of "everyone engaging in research and everyone talking about laws" has emerged.

The broad masses of cadres and commune members in Songjiang County have initially grasped the growth laws of rice from practice, and then used these laws to guide practice. Through research, practice, re-research, and re-practice, cycling repeatedly, the level of field management has been continuously improved, truly achieving meticulous, concrete, and scientific management. Qi Bingsheng, a commune member of the Nongyi Production Team of the Chengbei Commune, after studying the six-character experience of field management, combined with his recent experience of observing rice seedlings in the fields, summarized the different management methods to be adopted according to the different forms of yellowing of rice seedlings. He believes that some yellowing of rice seedlings is due to insufficient fertility, while some is a normal physiological phenomenon, so they should be treated differently, and it is unscientific to apply fertilizer to all yellow seedlings. The production team party branch adopted his opinion. The team's late rice fields were divided into several different types, and topdressing was implemented according to the seedlings.

People have mastered the laws of rice growth and development, and in field management, the sense of consciousness and foresight has been greatly enhanced, and people's subjective initiative has been further developed. Now, all communes and production teams in the county, on the one hand, are increasing field management measures and continuing to vigorously attack the "panicle number" key; on the other hand, they are making ideological and material preparations, determined to break through the "grain number" and "grain weight" keys in the next step. Most of the production teams in Xinwu and Caojing Communes have allocated 10%-20% of their labor force to increase the accumulation of fine fertilizer in preparation for a topdressing application between "Great Heat" and "Beginning of Autumn" to increase grain number and grain weight, establishing a second line of defense for large-scale balanced production increase.

### 松江县根据水稻习性精管水稻　力争亩亩水稻保住三十万有效穗

    松江县根据水稻习性精管水稻
　　力争亩亩水稻保住三十万有效穗
    本报上海14日电　中共上海市松江县委通讯组报道：松江县干部带头，全民动手，认真研究水稻的生长发育规律，大抓田间管理，猛攻发棵关，力争“亩亩水稻田有三十万个有效穗”，实现大面积的平衡增产的要求。
    群众性的对水稻长穗阶段的研究工作，已初步收到成效。中共松江县委在水稻万亩丰产方中，根据原松江县农业劳动模范陈永康运用“三黄三黑”
  （即晚稻从插秧到成熟叶色三次变浓、三次变淡过程）的经验，具体总结了水稻在“初黄初黑”阶段的管理“六字”经验，经过讨论提高，已证明它是保证达到每亩三十万个有效穗的好经验。哪里贯彻执行得坚决全面，哪里的稻苗就发棵早，发棵好，一般都达到了三十万到三十五万个穗子。这六字经验的具体内容就是：“一勤”就是浅水勤灌，经常灌，保持水浆新鲜，使稻根扎得深，主秆粗壮，发棵好；“二早”就是提早补苗匀苗，缺棵补齐，大棵匀小，小棵补足，保证每亩有足够的基本苗；“三抢”就是抢时间耥稻，农民说：“稻耥黄秧草耥芽”，早耥稻能早生新根，早发棵，并压住杂草抬头；“四紧”就是耥稻后紧接着耘稻，结合拔尽稗草；“五巧”就是巧追肥，肥料品种搭配好，看田脚、看基肥、看稻苗追肥，肥料用在刀口上；“六狠”就是狠治虫，无虫防虫，有虫治虫，不让虫害抬头。
    春季以来，中共松江县委在“三分种，七分管”和“管早、管好、管细”的思想指导下，就把研究水稻在生长发育的一般规律，提高耕作和田间管理水平，发展农业“八字宪法”，作为一项战斗任务，提到全县各级党组织和广大干部、群众的面前。任务提出之后，中共松江县委和各级干部都深入基层。通过参加生产劳动，实地观察和访问社员，召开座谈会，以及总结去年水稻千斤丰产田的经验，得出了以下结论：在合理密植的基础上，狠抓“水”、
  “肥”两关，及时耘耥除草，既促进分蘖（前期）又控制分蘖（后期），保证每亩水稻田有三十万个有效穗，这样亩产量就有达到甚至超过千斤的希望。
    在县委的正确领导下，全县迅速掀起了一个研究水稻生长发育规律、田间管理讲科学的群众运动。县委和公社党委直接掌握的十九处水稻万亩丰产方，都建立了技术研究委员会，并设有灌溉、追肥、治虫灭病等专业研究组，进行专题研究。县、公社的水稻万亩丰产方，已成为田间管理的指挥阵地。生产队都有技术研究小组，小队有技术研究员。这样，上下结合，层层带动，就出现了一个“人人搞研究，个个讲规律”的新局面。
    松江县广大干部和社员从实践中初步摸到了水稻的生长规律，又用这些规律去指导实践，经过研究、实践、再研究、再实践，循环反复，田间管理水平就不断提高，真是做到管得细，管得具体，管得科学。城北公社农益生产队社员乞炳生学习田间管理六字经验后，结合最近田头观察稻苗的心得，总结出根据稻苗发黄的不同形态，要采取的不同的管理方法。他认为稻苗发黄，有的是因为肥力不足，有的是正常的生理现象，因而要不同对待，一概采取见黄苗就追肥的办法是不科学的。生产队党支部就采纳了他的意见。把全队晚稻田分成几种不同的类型，实行看苗追肥。
    人们掌握了水稻的生长发育规律，在田间管理上，就大大增强了自觉性和预见性，人的主观能动性得到了更大的发挥。现在，全县各公社、生产队，一方面对田间管理措施加码，继续猛攻“穗数”关；另一方面，做好思想准备和物质准备，决心在下一步攻破“粒数”和“粒重”两关。新五、漕泾公社的大部分生产队，都已投放10％—20％劳动力，增积精肥，准备“大暑”“立秋”间的一遍追肥，达到增粒增重，为大面积平衡增产建立第二道防线。
