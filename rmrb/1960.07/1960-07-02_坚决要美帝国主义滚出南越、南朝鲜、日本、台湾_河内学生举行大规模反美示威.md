Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th -- Fifteen thousand students from secondary schools in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, held a rally this morning at the Hanoi Grand Theater Square to oppose the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism and the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam.

After Le Bat, a representative of the Hanoi Youth Federation, exposed the atrocities of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam at the meeting, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese youth and the Vietnamese people, not only have they not succumbed to the bloody suppression of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, but they have also persisted in an increasingly fierce struggle over the past few years. He finally represented all young students in Hanoi in expressing their firm support for the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people and young students against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and their support for the anti-U.S. patriotic struggles of the people and young students of Asian countries.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the letter of June 24th from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, demanding that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, opposing the International Commission’s conclusions regarding South Vietnam authorities’ “Ordinance No. 10 of 1959” and the resolution allowing the “U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group” to increase its military personnel in South Vietnam, and demanding that the International Commission fulfill its responsibilities and strictly implement the Geneva Agreements.

After the meeting, the students held a large-scale demonstration, holding up caricatures they had drawn satirizing the ugly behavior of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and placards with anti-American slogans. When the procession passed the Hanoi office of the International Commission, the students shouted slogans such as "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of South Vietnam" and "Oppose Ordinance No. 10 of 1959."
