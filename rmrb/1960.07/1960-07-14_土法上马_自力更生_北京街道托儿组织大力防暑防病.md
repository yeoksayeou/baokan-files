　　Indigenous Methods, Self-Reliance
　　Beijing Street-Level Nurseries Vigorously Prevent Heatstroke and Disease

　　(Our report) Beijing's urban people's commune street-level nursery organizations, under the leadership of the commune party committee, are adopting methods such as indigenous approaches and self-reliance to carry out heatstroke and disease prevention work.

　　Since the beginning of summer, the incidence of illness in Beijing's many urban commune nursery organizations has greatly decreased, and a number of disease-free nurseries and centers have emerged. In Chongwen District, the incidence of dysentery among children in various commune street-level nursery organizations decreased by 90% in June compared to January, and by 91% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. In the Qianmen and Yongdingmen communes’ nursery organizations, not a single child contracted dysentery in June. Since late June, disease-free nurseries and centers in the Dashilan commune have reached over 80%.

　　Since the establishment of the urban people's communes this year, Beijing's street-level nursery organizations have developed greatly. By the end of May, the total number of children enrolled had increased nearly twofold compared to the end of last year, and most of the newly built nursery organizations were set up using simple and crude methods. Therefore, how to prevent heatstroke and disease and allow children to spend the summer comfortably and safely is very important.

　　To solve the problem of heatstroke prevention and cooling in nursery organizations, the party committees of various communes mobilized the broad masses of childcare workers, parents, and social forces to adopt indigenous methods and self-reliance, such as making homemade fans, earth-made showers, opening more windows, building sunshades, and making homemade refreshing drinks to prevent heatstroke and cool down. In addition, in the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the communes, some necessary equipment was added according to possibilities and needs. For example, the Guang'anmenwai and Guang'anmennei People's Communes recently added some wall beds that can be opened and folded to help children in daycare get a good nap.

　　Currently, in some street-level nursery organizations, most of the houses that can have front and rear windows have already opened them to allow air convection and ventilation. Those that cannot open front and rear windows are installing homemade fans. The Dashilan commune's various nursery organizations pooled their wisdom and efforts, and in a week-long battle, opened ninety-five windows, exchanged twenty-seven rooms facing west, and made one hundred and ten simple earth-made fans of the hanging, spinning wheel, and windmill types, basically solving the problem of ventilation and cooling in all nursery organizations. The childcare workers of Xibiying Kindergarten in this commune used a few waste newspapers and a rope to make a hand-pulled hanging fan. A parent of a child in the Xijingjidao Kindergarten of the Erlonglu People's Commune, upon hearing that the kindergarten lacked materials to make earth-made fans, took the initiative to send plywood.

　　In terms of disease prevention, Xicheng, Dongcheng, Xuanwu, and other districts recently held conferences for childcare workers to exchange the advanced experiences of disease-free nurseries and centers, and strengthened the professional training of childcare workers in cooperation with the health departments. Many medical personnel went deep into the street-level nursery organizations, adopting methods such as delivering lectures and taking on apprentices to teach health knowledge to childcare workers, and assisted the nursery organizations in establishing and improving various health care systems.

### 土法上马　自力更生　北京街道托儿组织大力防暑防病

　　土法上马　自力更生
　　北京街道托儿组织大力防暑防病
    本报讯　北京城市人民公社的街道托儿组织，正在公社党委领导下，采取土法上马、自力更生等办法，开展防暑防病工作。
    入夏以来，北京许多城市公社托儿组织发病率大大下降，并出现了一批无病园、所。崇文区各个公社街道托儿组织的孩子痢疾发病率6月份比1月份降低90％，第二季度比去年同期降低91％。前门、永定门两个公社托儿组织的孩子，6月份没有一个患痢疾的，大栅栏公社自6月下旬以来，无病园、所达80％以上。
    今年以来，随着城市人民公社的建立，北京街道托儿组织大发展，截止5月底，已收托儿童总数比去年年底增加将近两倍，新建托儿组织又多半是因陋就简办起来的。因此如何防暑防病让孩子舒适安全地渡过夏天，很关紧要。
    各个公社党委为解决托儿组织的防暑降温，发动广大保教人员、家长和社会力量，采取土法上马、自力更生办法，自制土风扇、土淋浴和多开窗口、搭凉棚、自制清凉饮料等，来防暑降温。此外，本着勤俭办社的精神，根据可能和需要，添置了一部分必要的设备。如广安门外和广安门内人民公社，最近为使日托孩子睡好午觉，已添置了一些可以打开、折叠的壁床。
    现在，一部分街道托儿组织的房子凡是能开前后窗的大都已开了前后窗，使空气对流通风，不能开前后窗的正在安装土风扇。大栅栏公社各个托儿组织群策群力，大战一周，开了窗口九十五个，调换了西晒房子二十七间，自制吊扇式、纺车式、风车式简易土风扇一百一十个，基本上解决了全部托儿组织通风降温问题。这个公社的西壁营幼儿园的保教人员利用几张废报纸，一根绳子，制成手拉吊风扇。二龙路人民公社西京畿道幼儿园一个孩子的家长，听说园里做土风扇缺材料，主动送来了三合板。
    在防病方面，西城、东城、宣武等区最近都召开了保教人员大会，交流无病园、所的先进经验，并协同卫生部门加强对保教人员的业务训练。许多医务人员深入街道托儿组织，采取送课上门和带徒弟的办法，把卫生知识教给保教人员，并协助托儿组织建立和健全各种卫生保健制度。
