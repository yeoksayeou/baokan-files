Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 3rd: Chongqing's hygiene work closely follows the new situation of rapid collectivization of the urban people's production and life, and has promptly established a set of health and medical care networks adapted to the organizational form of urban people's communes, bringing urban hygiene work into a new stage.

By the end of March this year, Chongqing had established thirty-seven street people's communes. At present, more than 3,800 public canteens and more than 1,500 nurseries and kindergartens have been established in the city's streets. More than 80% of the commune members have joined the canteens, and more than 65% of the children have entered nurseries. The city has also established more than 800 commune-run factories, showing a thriving scene of "every family is busy with production, and every household has no idlers."

In response to the situation of rapid collectivization of production and life, Chongqing has stepped up the establishment and improvement of health care work for collective living and welfare undertakings centered on commune canteens, so that commune members can eat well, eat cleanly and hygienically, and children can be healthy. In this regard, Chongqing has focused on the training of canteen service personnel and nursery teachers from the beginning. In February and March this year, the Central District of the city trained more than 5,000 cooks and nursery teachers through hygiene knowledge lectures, short-term training classes, and amateur learning. Among the cooks, a sense of hygiene was initially established, and hygiene and nutrition knowledge was mastered; nursery teachers generally understood basic common sense such as infant care, infectious disease prevention, and epidemic reporting. People's communes in various streets in the city have also vigorously carried out basic hygiene construction centered on canteens. Now, more than 3,000 street canteens in the city have established partitioned stoves (stove holes outside, reducing coal ash in the kitchen), tap water pipes and self-flowing sinks, and filtering sand tanks. Most canteens have renovated the ground and concealed ditches, and established simple mechanical washing equipment, steam boilers, storage rooms, cooks' changing rooms, and ventilation and refrigeration equipment. Simple bathrooms, barbershops, and boiling water stoves are also set up around the canteens. Kindergartens and nurseries in various communes have mostly renovated their houses, built new isolation rooms and activity places, and added health care equipment for children, such as health care bags. In order to ensure the regularisation of collective hygiene work, each canteen, nursery, and kindergarten has also established a set of hygiene and health care systems. For example, the canteen has established a system of "three preventions and one elimination" (preventing flies, dust, spoilage and disinfecting utensils), "separate use of three cloths" (separate use of cloths for wiping bowls, washing pots, and wiping tables), and "three-level inspection and acceptance" of food (inspection and acceptance by purchasers, cooks, and consumers) to ensure food is clean and hygienic and prevent the occurrence of diseases. The hygienic appearance of canteens and nurseries in various communes throughout the city has greatly changed. At present, more than 95% of the nurseries and kindergartens in the central district alone have basically achieved no disease.

This city has actively carried out hygiene work in commune-run industries by adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, and combining with production. The city's street-run industries have developed rapidly from scratch. Most of the factory buildings are civilian houses, the factory sites are scattered, the equipment is simple, the light is dim, and the ventilation is poor. 60% to 80% of the workers are housewives, who generally lacked industrial hygiene knowledge. Based on this characteristic, Chongqing's industrial hygiene work has generally set up industrial hygiene equipment to prevent harmful gases, dust, toxicity and virulent substances, as well as for heatstroke prevention and cooling, according to the method of adapting to local conditions and mainly using local methods. Many commune-run factories have improved and added workshop ventilation, lighting, drinking water barrels, manually operated fans, cool sheds and other equipment according to local conditions and time, and some factories also have special work clothes, labor protection shoes and socks, and gloves to prevent the erosion of harmful substances. According to the characteristics of having many female workers, various commune-run factories have especially strengthened the labor protection work for female workers. Factories with more than 50 people have generally set up female workers' health rooms, equipped with commonly used medicines and disinfectant paper; established menstrual cards and pregnancy records to keep abreast of the menstrual and pregnancy conditions of female workers and take care of them.

This city has adapted to the organizational form after the people's commune, and under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, established a health and medical care network with the commune hospital as the center, integrating medical prevention, health and epidemic prevention, maternal and child health care, and health publicity and education. The commune has organized health personnel who used to be scattered in the streets and established commune hospitals and simple maternity hospitals; the commune has established outpatient clinics or health stations; health stations have been established in various canteens, factories, districts, nurseries, and schools, and full-time or part-time health workers have been assigned. Now, there are thirty-seven street commune hospitals, fifty-four simple maternity hospitals, and more than 1,400 health stations in the city. In addition, the city has also universally established mass organizations such as health supervision posts and Red Scarf hospitals. In this way, under the business guidance of the commune hospital, the medical, health, epidemic prevention, health care, and health publicity work of the entire commune are systematically organized from top to bottom and from point to surface, so that the commune's health and medical care work can respond to every call, be rapid and timely, and minor illnesses do not leave the section, and major illnesses do not leave the street. Because health stations are spread among the basic masses such as canteens, nurseries, factories, districts, and schools in the commune, it is of particularly important significance for carrying out commune health care work more widely, deeply, and in a timely manner.

    因地制宜因时制宜结合生产大搞卫生
    重庆普建卫生医疗保健网
    据新华社重庆3日电　重庆卫生工作紧紧跟上城市人民生产、生活迅速实现集体化的新形势，及时建立起一套与城市人民公社组织形式相适应的卫生医疗保健网，使城市卫生工作进入了一个新阶段。
    重庆市到今年3月底已建立了三十七个街道人民公社。目前，在全市街道中已建立公共食堂三千八百多个，托儿所、幼儿园一千五百多个，80％以上的社员进入了食堂搭伙，65％以上的儿童入了托儿所。全市还举办了社办工厂八百多个，出现了“家家忙生产，户户无闲人”的蓬勃景象。
    针对生产、生活迅速集体化的形势，重庆市抓紧建立与健全了以公社食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业的卫生保健工作，使社员吃得好，吃得干净卫生，使得儿童身体健康。在这方面，重庆市一开始就大抓食堂服务人员和托儿所保育员的训练。市中区今年2、3月就通过卫生知识讲座、短期训练班、业余学习等方式，训练了炊事员、保育员五千多人，在炊事员中，初步树立起卫生观念，掌握了卫生营养知识；保育员一般都懂得幼儿护理、传染病预防、疫情报告等基本常识。全市各街道人民公社还大搞以食堂为中心的卫生基本建设。现在，全市的三千多个街道食堂，都建立了隔壁灶（灶孔在外，使厨房减少煤灰）、自来水管和自流水槽、过滤沙缸，大多数食堂修整了地面和暗沟，建立了简易机械冲洗设备、蒸气锅炉、贮藏室、炊事员更衣室和通风冷藏设备等。在食堂周围还设置了简易浴室、理发室、开水灶等。各个公社的幼儿园、托儿所，大都粉刷改造了房屋，新建了隔离室与活动场所，添置了儿童保健袋等卫生医疗设备。为了保证集体卫生工作的经常化，各个食堂和托儿所、幼儿园还建立了一套卫生保健制度。如在食堂建立了“三防一消”（防蝇、防尘、防腐和用具消毒）、“三帕分用”（擦碗、洗锅、抹桌三帕的分用）和食品的“三级检收”（采购员、炊事员、食用者检收）等制度，保证食物清洁卫生，预防了疾病发生。使全市各公社的食堂、托儿所等的卫生面貌有了很大变化。目前，仅市中区就有95％以上的托儿所、幼儿园基本上实现了无病。
    这个市曾因地制宜、因时制宜、结合生产，积极开展了社办工业卫生工作。全市街道社办工业白手起家发展很快，厂房多系民房，厂址分散，设备简陋、光线暗、通风差；在职工中有60％到80％是家庭妇女，原来一般都缺乏工业卫生知识。根据这一特点，重庆市的社办工业卫生工作，根据因地制宜、土法为主的办法，普遍设置了防止有害气体、粉尘、毒性和烈性物质以及防暑降温等工业卫生设备，不少社办工厂因地因时地改进和添置了车间通风、照明、饮水茶桶、人拉风扇、凉棚等设备，有的工厂还有专用工作服、劳保鞋袜、手套，以防止有害物质的侵蚀。各个社办工厂根据女工多的特点，特别加强了女工劳动保护工作，有五十人以上的工厂普遍设立了女工卫生室，备有常用药品和消毒手纸等；建立了月经卡片和怀孕记录，及时掌握女工月经期和怀孕期情况，加以照顾。
    这个市适应人民公社化后的组织形式，在公社党委的统一领导下，建立一套以公社医院为中心的医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼保健、卫生宣传教育四结合的卫生医疗保健网，公社把过去街道上分散开业的卫生人员组织起来，建立了公社医院和简易产院；公社成立了门诊部或卫生所；各个食堂、工厂、地段、托儿所、学校建立了保健站，配备了专职或兼职的保健员。现在，全市有街道公社医院三十七个，简易产院五十四个，保健站一千四百多个。此外，这个市还普遍建立了卫生监督岗、红领巾医院等群众性的组织。这样，在公社医院的业务指导下，把全公社的医疗、卫生、防疫、保健以及卫生宣传等工作从上而下，由点到面系统地组织了起来，使公社的卫生医疗保健工作能够做到一呼百应，迅速及时，小病不出段，大病不出街。由于保健站遍及公社的食堂、托儿所、工厂、地段和学校等基层群众中，对更加广泛、深入、及时地开展公社卫生保健工作有着特别重要的意义。
