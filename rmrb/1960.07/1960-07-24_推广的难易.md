The Difficulty of Promotion
　　Wu Lü

Some people say: "Innovation is easy, promotion is difficult." This comparison is, of course, not scientific. Innovation and promotion are related, but they are not equivalent. It is difficult to say which is easy and which is difficult. Even if innovation and promotion can be equated, innovation is not an easy task: the emergence of any new technology and the birth of new equipment are the result of the innovators' hard work, even the result of hundreds of failures and unyielding efforts. How can the word "easy" explain it? However, from another point of view, there is some truth to the saying "innovation is easy, promotion is difficult." From innovation to promotion is a popularization process from point to surface, from local to whole. In the process of promotion, the conflict between new technologies and old habits is much more widespread. At the same time, any new technology is produced under certain specific conditions, and to promote it, it must be adapted to various different conditions. In this sense, promotion is indeed not easier than innovation.

It is very beneficial to pay attention to this point. It reminds us that promotion is also a meticulous and arduous task, not something that can be solved by simply making an appeal and issuing a few technical materials. This is precisely what some comrades tend to overlook.

So, does it mean that promotion must be a very slow process? Not necessarily. The difficulty and ease of a matter, the complexity and simplicity of a task, are of course objective phenomena, but this objective phenomenon is relative to a certain subjective force. A new folk song says: "Difficulty is like a spring, see how strong you are; if you are strong, it is weak; if you are weak, it is strong." Isn't the difficulty of things also like this? What is extremely difficult in the eyes of a coward is not difficult for a person with great ambitions. Returning to the topic of promotion, whether it is difficult or easy, whether it is a slow process or can be quickly applied to production, also depends on our subjective efforts and how well the work is done.

The example of the Chongqing Standard Parts Factory can well illustrate this point. At first, only more than 50% of the factory's innovation projects were applied to production. Although several mobilization meetings were held, requiring workers to innovate and use each innovation, some projects were still not used. It seems that promotion is indeed very difficult. However, when the leadership realized that the key to the problem was that "general appeals were not enough, we must go deep," and improved their leadership style, went deep into the grassroots, and worked hard to solve many ideological and technical problems in promotion and use, the situation was very different. The utilization rate of innovation projects increased to 90.2%, and since July, production has been high every day. In the first ten days of the month, 44.8% of the monthly plan was completed. It can be seen that as long as the work is done thoroughly, practically, and meticulously, promotion is not difficult.

To widely apply the results of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to production and promote the continued leap forward in production is a very important task at present. Promoting a thorough, practical, and meticulous work style will surely make this work faster and better.

    推广的难易
    吴滤
    有人说：“革新容易推广难”。这种对比的方法，当然是并不科学的。革新和推广虽有联系，毕竟不是可以等同的事情，很难说究竟那一个容易，那一个难。即便可以把革新和推广等同对比，但革新并不是一件轻而易举的事情：任何一项新技术的出现和新设备的诞生，都是革新者付出了艰苦劳动的结果，甚至是经过几百次失败，百折不挠的结果，岂是“容易”二字能够说明的？不过，从另一方面来考虑，“革新容易推广难”也有一定的道理。由革新到推广，是一个由点到面、由局部到全体的普及过程。在推广过程中，新的技术和旧的习惯势力的冲突要广泛得多；同时，任何新技术都是在一定的具体条件下产生的，要把它推广开去，还需要使它适应各种不同的条件。从这个意义上说，推广确实并不比革新容易。
    注意到这一点，很有好处。它提醒我们：推广也是一件细致的、艰苦的工作，并不是简单地做一番号召，印发几份技术资料就能解决问题的。而这一点，恰恰是有些同志往往容易忽视的。
    那么，是不是说推广就必然是一个很缓慢的过程了呢？却又不然。一件事情的难和易、一件工作的复杂和简单，固然都是客观存在的现象，但是这种客观现象又是同一定的主观力量对比而言的。新民歌有谓：“困难像弹簧，看你强不强；你强它就弱，你弱它就强。”事情的难易又何尝不是如此？在懦夫的眼中是难极了的事情，在胸怀大志的人看来，却又不难办到。回到推广这个题目上来，是难是易，是缓慢的过程、还是可以迅速运用于生产，也决定于我们主观上的努力如何，工作做得如何。
    重庆标准件厂的例子就很能说明这个问题。这个厂始而只有50％以上的革新项目运用于生产，尽管开了几次动员大会，要求工人革新一件使用一件，但是有的项目还是没有使用起来。看来，推广确实很难。然而，当领导上发现问题的关键在于“光是一般号召不行了，必须深入下去”，改进了领导作风，深入基层，踏踏实实地去做工作，解决了推广使用中的许多思想问题、技术问题以后，情况就大不相同了。革新项目的利用率提高到90.2％，7月以来天天高产，上旬十天就完成了月计划的44.8％。可见，只要工作做得深入、踏实、细致，推广却又并不难。
    把技术革新和技术革命运动的成果广泛运用于生产，促进生产继续跃进，是当前一件很重要的工作。发扬深入、踏实、细致的工作作风，一定可以把这件工作做得更快、更好。
