Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 18th: Newspapers here reported that on July 16th, the Albanian government replied to the Soviet government regarding the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' cessation of participation in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, stating that the Albanian government fully supports the position taken by the Soviet government and other socialist countries participating in the Committee on this issue.

The note stated that the people of all countries will never forgive the US government and the governments of other Western countries participating in the Committee for their shameless refusal to study and adopt the Soviet government's proposal on complete and thorough disarmament, and will never forgive their conscious sabotage of efforts to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on this issue. Obviously, the Western countries are not only not prepared to conduct serious negotiations on this issue, but also want to impose on others a plan for supervision without disarmament, that is, a military espionage plan that favors the legalization of their aggressive policies. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries participating in the Committee can in no way accept such despicable and hostile attempts by the Western countries.

The note pointed out that the Albanian government believes that the negative attitude of the Western countries in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee is inseparable from the US sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, their acts of aggression against the Soviet Union on May 1st and July 1st, their attempt to expand armaments, equip West German revanchists with rockets and nuclear weapons, and strengthen aggressive military treaties. The note said that this provocative policy of US imperialism and its partners has greatly sharpened international relations and increased the threat to peace. Obviously, under these circumstances, our peace-loving countries cannot but heighten vigilance and strengthen defense preparations, and must maintain and strengthen the Warsaw Pact to further consolidate our unity. The Albanian government also supports the Soviet government's suggestion to the upcoming UN General Assembly, requesting the meeting to discuss the disarmament issue and the implementation of the UN General Assembly's resolution of last November. The note finally stated that the Albanian government will sponsor efforts to resolve the disarmament issue, while exposing the aggressive policies of Western countries and mobilizing public opinion against the US imperialists who endanger peace.

　　阿尔巴尼亚政府发出复照
　　支持苏联政府对裁军会议的立场
    新华社地拉那18日电　此间报纸报道：阿尔巴尼亚政府16日就苏联和其他社会主义国家停止参加十国裁军委员会会议复照苏联政府说，阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持苏联政府以及其他参加十国裁军委员会的社会主义国家政府对这一问题所持的立场。
    照会说，世界各国人民绝不会宽恕美国政府和参加委员会的其他西方国家政府无耻地拒绝研究和采纳苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的建议，绝不会宽恕它们有意识地破坏为就此问题达成一项相互可以接受的协议所作的努力。显然，西方国家不仅不准备对此问题进行认真的谈判，而且要强加于别人一项没有裁军的监督的计划，即有利于它们侵略政策的合法化的军事间谍计划。苏联和其他参加委员会的社会主义国家无论如何不能接受西方国家这种卑鄙的和敌对的企图。
    照会指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，西方国家在十国裁军委员会的消极态度是同美国破坏四国首脑会议、在5月1日和7月1日对苏联的侵略行为分不开的，是同它们扩充军备、用火箭和核武器装备西德复仇主义者和加强侵略性的军事条约的企图分不开的。照会说，美帝国主义及其伙伴的这种挑衅政策使国际关系大大尖锐化了；增加了对和平的威胁。显然，在这种情况下，我们爱好和平的国家不能不提高警惕和加强防卫准备，不得不保持和加强华沙条约，进一步巩固自己的团结。阿尔巴尼亚政府还支持苏联政府向联合国即将召开的大会提出建议，要求会议讨论裁军问题和联合国大会去年11月的决议的执行情况。照会最后表示，阿尔巴尼亚政府将赞助解决裁军问题的努力，同时将揭露西方国家的侵略政策，并将动员舆论反对危害和平的美帝国主义者。
