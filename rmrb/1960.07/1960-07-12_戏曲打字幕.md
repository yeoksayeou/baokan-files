　　Subtitling for Opera
    I think that displaying subtitles via projector during local opera performances is a very welcome practice for the audience. However, some opera troupes (especially Peking Opera) do not yet have projected subtitles during their performances, which leads to the audience not understanding the lyrics and reducing their interest. I hope that the troupes of various opera genres can take the audience into consideration and provide subtitles during performances.
    In the existing projected subtitles, some of the ink is too faint, the characters are written sloppily, and some even have typos, which prevents them from achieving the desired effect. I hope that the leaders of each troupe will pay attention to this work and regard it as an indispensable part of the performance work.

### 戏曲打字幕

　　戏曲打字幕
    我觉得地方戏曲演出时打幻灯字幕，是一个观众很欢迎的做法。但是，有些戏曲剧团（特别是京剧）的演出，还没有幻灯字幕，以致观众不了解唱词，减少兴趣。希望各个剧种的剧团演出时都能为观众着想，打字幕。
    在现有的幻灯字幕上，有的墨迹太淡，字也写得潦草，有的甚至写别字，这样便不能收到应有的效果。希望各剧团领导上重视这一工作，把它看作演出工作中不可缺少的一部分。
