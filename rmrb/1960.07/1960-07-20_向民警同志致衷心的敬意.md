　　Deepest Respects to the People's Police Comrades
　　Shenyang Wang Qi
    After watching "Today I Rest," as we walked out of the cinema, the crowd burst into enthusiastic praise: "Such a people's policeman, truly a good servant of the people!" Yes, the film has ended, but our hearts cannot calm down, we express our heartfelt gratitude and pay our deepest respects to those people's police comrades who, for the sake of the people, fear no hardship and even forget to eat and sleep!
    This is a successful film. Through the activities of household registration policeman Ma Tianmin on his day off, it sings the praises of the new morality and new customs of socialist society, reflecting the noble communist style of the people's police, who wholeheartedly serve the masses under the education of the Party, and the close, inseparable relationship between the people's police and the masses.
    Ma Tianmin is one of the thousands of people's police who defend the socialist motherland, protect the lives and property of the people, and wholeheartedly serve the masses. He does ordinary, trivial work that is often not noticed: for example, residents of the neighborhood hold meetings to promote the Party's policies, help the masses solve various problems and difficulties in their lives, help the masses with work, and so on. He takes the joy of the masses as his own joy, and the suffering of the masses as his own suffering, and is therefore loved and supported by the masses. On a public holiday, in order to help an old man from a people's commune who was delivering pigs to a steel factory in Shanghai find the factory; to send a child who was sick with a sudden illness because his mother was not at home and his father was working in steelmaking to the hospital for treatment; to return a wallet containing important items to its owner, he busied himself all day, bringing much convenience and joy to the people, even though he therefore broke his appointment with the girl who was waiting to meet him. His spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly was warmly praised by the people: "You are truly a good comrade!"
    But he, just like our millions of heroes and models, humbly said: "This is the Party's education of me!" This is the typical example of countless nameless heroes in our era who work diligently for the Party and the people!
    The film shows us the relationship of sincere mutual assistance between people under the socialist system. No matter where you go or what difficulties you encounter, you will not feel lonely, and you will receive care and help everywhere, making us feel the infinite warmth of living in a socialist family. It also shows us that with the deepening of the socialist revolution, a new and noble social atmosphere has been formed in our country.
    The film also reflects from the side the magnificent momentum of 650 million people under the leadership of the Party, going all out, "one day equals twenty years" in building socialism, and the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward, making us feel the great changes taking place in our motherland. It also shows us the spirit of great collaboration between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and various enterprises, encouraged by the common goal of accelerating socialist construction, which will make our socialist economy more consolidated and developed.
    The film has a complete structure, novel subject matter, and a lively and cheerful melody. The actors' performances are also very simple. (Attached picture)

　　向民警同志致衷心的敬意
　　沈阳　王其
    看完《今天我休息》，从电影院里走出来，人群里发出热烈的赞叹声：“这样的民警，可真是人民的好勤务员呵！”是的，影片演完了，但我们的心却无法平静，我们怀着深深的感激，向那些为人民群众不畏艰苦，甚至废寝忘食的民警同志致以衷心的敬意！
    这是一部成功的影片。它通过户籍警马天民休息日一天的活动，歌颂了社会主义社会的新道德、新风尚，反映出了在党的教育下，人民警察热心为群众服务的高尚的共产主义风格，和人民警察与群众的水乳交融的亲密关系。
    马天民是千万个捍卫着社会主义祖国、保卫着人民生命财产安全，全心全意为人民群众服务的民警中的一个，他做的是平凡的、琐碎的一些不大被人们注意的工作：比如里弄的居民开会，宣传党的方针政策，帮助群众解决生活中发生的各种问题和困难，帮助群众干活等等。他以群众之乐为己乐，以群众之苦为己苦，因而受到群众的爱戴和拥护。在一个公休日里，他为了帮助一位从某人民公社送猪给上海一个钢厂的老大爷找到工厂；为了把母亲不在家、父亲正在炼钢而得了急病的小孩送到医院治疗；为了把装有重要物件的皮夹送还它的失主，他忙碌了一整天，给人们带来了多少方便与欢乐，虽然他因此失约于等着和他见面的姑娘。他的忠心耿耿为人民服务的精神，受到人民群众的热烈赞扬：“你，真是个好同志呵！”
    但他却正和我们千百万个英雄模范一样谦虚地说：“这是党对我的教育呵！”这就是我们时代千千万万为党为人民勤恳工作的无名英雄的典型！
    影片使我们看到了在社会主义制度下人与人之间真诚相助的关系，不论你走到哪儿，遇到什么困难，都不会感到孤单，到处会得到关怀和帮助，使我们感觉到生活在社会主义的大家庭的无限温暖。也使我们看到，随着社会主义革命的日益深入，在我们的国家里一种新的、高尚的社会风气已经形成。
    影片也从侧面反映出了六亿五千万人民在党的领导下，鼓足干劲、“一天等于二十年”地建设社会主义的磅礴气势，以及一浪高一浪的大跃进高潮，使我们感到我们的祖国正在发生的巨大的变化。也使我们看到在加速建设社会主义的同一目标的鼓舞下，工农、城乡各企业部门的大协作的精神，这将使我们社会主义的经济更为巩固和发展。
    影片的结构完整，题材新颖，曲调活泼而轻快。演员的表演也很朴实。（附图片）
