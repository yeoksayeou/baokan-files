    Three-Minute Experience Exchange Meeting
    In the early morning, the warm sunlight shone on the tender green rice seedlings. A group of young men and women from the Shuguang Production Team of the Xitang Commune in Pinghu, Zhejiang, were using light and flexible weeding tools, cultivating the fields with "swish, swish" sounds. A person wearing a yellow military cap, powerfully and nimbly pushing the weeding tool, quickly left the young men and women behind.
      "No, Secretary Jin of the production team has run ahead of us, everyone hurry up!" said Yang Shouying, the leader of the youth shock team.
      "Catching up with me is possible, but there must be three conditions," the secretary said: "First, the weeds must be completely removed; second, the mud must be thoroughly raked; third, the barnyard grass in the rice sprouts must be pulled out completely—in a word, the quality must be guaranteed."
      "What Secretary Jin can do, we can do too!" everyone replied.
    One row was finished, and Secretary Jin was still in the lead.
    "Come on, young fellows, let's have a three-minute experience exchange meeting," said Secretary Jin.
    Twelve young people gathered around Secretary Jin in a circle at the edge of the field. Secretary Jin picked up another weeding tool and said, "Look, the tines of this weeding tool are full of grass. Isn't it difficult to push?" He continued, "To weed quickly and well, there are two tricks: First, the back foot should step a little bigger, so that when pushing, the front body can lunge forward and exert more force. Second, the handle of the weeding tool should be held longer, and the handle should be moved to the front when pushing, so it will be more flexible and lighter to use."
    Everyone found the "tricks" and felt particularly happy, saying, "Secretary Jin, today we guarantee that each person will cultivate seven mu well and cultivate all the late rice fields that the fifth and sixth teams have not yet cultivated four times!" (Wu Yuan)

    三分钟的经验交流会
    清晨，阳光和煦地照着嫩绿的稻苗，浙江平湖西塘公社曙光生产队的一群青年男女一字成行地使用着轻巧灵便的耘耥器，正在“哗，哗”地耘田。一个戴着黄军帽的人，有力而敏捷地推动着耘耥器，一会儿就把小伙子和姑娘们丢到后面去了。
      “不行，生产队金书记跑到我们前面去了，大家加油赶呀！”青年突击队长杨手英说。
      “赶我倒可以，但要有三个条件。”这个书记说：“第一，草要除尽；第二，泥要耙糊；第三，稻稞里的稗草要拔光——一句话，要保证质量。”
      “书记做得到，我们也做得到！”大家回答说。
    一行结束了，金书记还是在前面。
    “来，小伙子，我们来开个三分钟的经验交流会。”金书记说。
    十二个小青年绕着金书记在田头围了一个圈子。金书记随手拿起另一把耘耥器说：“看，这一把耘耥器的钉上尽是草缠着，推起来还不吃力吗？”他接着说：“要耘得快、耘得好，有两个窍门：第一，后脚要跨得稍大一点，这样推起来前身可以扑得出去，用得出力。第二，耘耥器的柄要拿得长一些，推出去时柄要移到前面来，这样用起来就更灵活轻便了。”
    大家找到了“窍门”，感到格外高兴，都说：“金书记，今天我们保证每人耘好七亩，把五、六小队还没有耘好四遍的连作早稻田全部耘好！”　（吴源）
