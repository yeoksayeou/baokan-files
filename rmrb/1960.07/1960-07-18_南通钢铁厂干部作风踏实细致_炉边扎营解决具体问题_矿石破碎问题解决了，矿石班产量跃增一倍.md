　　Nantong Steel Plant Cadres Work Steadily and Meticulously
　　Camping by the Furnace to Solve Specific Problems
　　Ore Crushing Problem Solved, Ore Shift Output Increased by One Time
    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to Nanjing Xinhua Daily: The leading cadres of Nantong Steel Plant camped by the furnace, firmly grasped the weak links, and solved specific problems in a down-to-earth manner, prompting the continuous rise of steel production.
    With the great leap forward in steel production, ore supply sometimes could not meet the needs, becoming a weak link in the whole plant. In early June, Wang Jinru, deputy secretary of the plant's Party committee, and Gu Zhijin, deputy plant director, led a working group to camp in the raw material workshop of the blast furnace workshop, worked alongside the shifts, mobilized the masses, and solved this problem. While working, they conducted investigations and research, and found that the shortage of ore supply was mainly due to the failure of ore crushing to keep up, which was caused by the easy damage to the crusher. Why was the crusher easily damaged? As a result of their in-depth investigation, they found that there were some chaotic phenomena in production management, sending large pieces of ore into the crusher, which often damaged the equipment. In response to these situations, they mobilized the masses to improve production management, so that small ores were sent to the crusher for crushing, and large pieces of ore were sent to the roughing machine. After taking these measures, within three days, the output of the ore shift doubled, breaking through the ore crushing barrier. At this time, Deputy Director Gu Zhijin found that the ore sieving process could not keep up, and a new imbalance appeared. They immediately mobilized the workers to carry out technical revolution and made their own "leaking sieves" to replace vibrating screens. Gu Zhijin and welder Wang Dejun and six other people fought for a day and successfully made three "leaking sieves", breaking through this new weak link and ensuring that the blast furnace was well-fed.

　　南通钢铁厂干部作风踏实细致
　　炉边扎营解决具体问题
　　矿石破碎问题解决了，矿石班产量跃增一倍
    本报讯　据南京新华日报消息：南通钢铁厂领导干部到炉边扎营，狠抓薄弱环节，踏踏实实地解决一个一个的具体问题，促使钢铁生产不断上升。
    随着钢铁生产的跃进，矿石供应有时不能满足需要，成为全厂的薄弱环节。6月初，厂的党委副书记王金如、副厂长顾志进带领工作组，到高炉车间的原料工场扎营，跟班劳动，发动群众，解决这一问题。他们一边劳动一边调查研究，发现矿石供应不足主要是由于矿石破碎跟不上，破碎机容易损坏所造成的。为什么破碎机容易损坏？他们深追细查的结果，发现生产管理上存在某些混乱现象，让大块大块的矿石送进破碎机，经常损坏设备。针对这些情况，他们就发动群众，改进生产管理，做到小矿石送破碎机破碎，大块矿石则送开坯机。采取这些措施后，在三天之内，矿石班产量就提高了一倍，突破了矿石破碎关。这时候，副厂长顾志进又发现筛矿工序跟不上了，出现了新的不平衡。他们又立即发动工人大搞技术革命，自制“漏筛”代替震动筛。顾志进和电焊工王德均等六个人奋战了一天，制成功了三台
  “漏筛”，突破了这一新的薄弱环节，保证了高炉吃饱吃好。
