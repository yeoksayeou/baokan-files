Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 21st. Vietnam News Agency reported today that Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently wrote to the governments of twenty-one Asian-African countries, requesting their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their country.

In his letter, Premier Pham Van Dong stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which consistently respects and correctly implements the Geneva Accords, hopes that the governments of these countries will "in the spirit of Asian-African solidarity from the Bandung Conference, the Cairo Conference, the Accra Conference, and the Conakry Conference, and for the sake of peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world, express concern for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and support the Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification of Vietnam on the basis of the Geneva Accords."

The twenty-one countries to which Premier Pham Van Dong wrote are: the Kingdom of Afghanistan, the Republic of Algeria, the Union of Burma, the Republic of the Congro, Ceylon, the Republic of Ghana, the Republic of Guinea, the Republic of Indonesia, the Iraqi Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federation of Malaya, the Mali Federation, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Kingdom of Nepal, Singapore, the Somali Republic, the Togolese Republic, the Tunisian Republic, the United Arab Republic, and the Kingdom of Yemen.

This letter, written on July 16, included a copy of Premier Pham Van Dong's note to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, also written on the same day. This note requested the two chairmen to "urgently consider the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam in order to take appropriate measures to stop and end all interference by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam."

Vietnam News Agency said that copies of this note have also been sent to the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina and the member states of the International Commission for Vietnam: India, Poland, and Canada.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 20th. People from all walks of life in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, held a mass rally here today to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on Indochina. The conference issued a statement requesting that U.S. military personnel immediately withdraw from South Vietnam, abide by the Geneva Accords, that the International Commission for Vietnam take effective measures in accordance with the Geneva Accords, to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam as soon as possible, and to stop the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's persecution of former resistance personnel and other patriots.

Deqin La Zui, Acting Chairman of the Burma Trade Union Congress, said at the meeting, "All U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam must withdraw."

He pointed out, "Due to the interference and obstruction of U.S. imperialism, the peaceful reunification of our neighbor Vietnam has not yet been achieved." "U.S. imperialism's obstruction of the peaceful reunification of Vietnam not only threatens peace in Vietnam, but also threatens peace in Southeast Asian countries and the world."

After exposing a series of evil activities by U.S. imperialism, such as sending U-2 aircraft to invade Soviet airspace, sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, illegally occupying China's territory of Taiwan, once again sending RB-47 bombers to invade Soviet airspace, interfering in the internal affairs of Cuba and the Congo, and strengthening its military activities in Southeast Asia, Deqin La Zui pointed out that all these "completely expose the falseness of the United States' peace policy and its warmongering face."

Wu Bin Yang Suda, Vice Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defence of World Peace, Wu Ang, a professor at the University of Yangon, and Bo Shan Mao, a leader of the People's Comrades Party, also spoke at the mass rally, expressing their support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and their indignation at U.S. interference in Vietnam's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st. Tokyo Dispatch: More than fifty representatives from all walks of life in Japan gathered in Tokyo on the 20th to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on Indochina, and passed a resolution expressing support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The gathering was jointly held by four organizations: the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, and the Japan-Vietnam Trade Association.

The resolution adopted at the meeting strongly condemned U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for openly undermining the Geneva Accords, strengthening and expanding military bases in South Vietnam, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and further escalating tensions in Asia.

The resolution firmly demanded that U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique fully implement the Geneva Accords, demanded that the U.S. military withdraw its military bases from South Vietnam, and abolish Decree No. 10 of 1959, which aims to suppress peaceful and patriotic people.

At the meeting, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Chairman of the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, and Nakagawa Nobuo, an expert on Asian issues, spoke successively, introducing the construction situation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and exposing the criminal conspiracy of U.S. imperialism against Vietnam.

Representatives from all walks of life spoke one after another, expressing the firm will of the Japanese people to stand with the Vietnamese people to strengthen the common struggle. National Diet member Okada Haruo said that he believed that the peaceful reunification of Vietnam would surely be realized.

Nguyen Vinh Khiep, a representative of Vietnamese nationals in Japan, emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and the Japanese people.

Representatives of the four organizations today also delivered the resolution to the embassies in Japan of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference and the "embassy" of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in Japan.
