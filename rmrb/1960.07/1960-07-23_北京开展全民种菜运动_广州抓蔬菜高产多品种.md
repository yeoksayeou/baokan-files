Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd – In response to the call from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to plant autumn vegetables on a large scale, various government organizations, factories, schools, and military units in Beijing have launched a high tide of mass vegetable growing, with everyone pitching in and making the most of every available space. These past few days, taking advantage of the favorable conditions of moist soil after the rain, many units have been organizing manpower to reclaim wasteland, remove weeds, level the land, and build ridges, having already sown the first batch of vegetable seeds.

All units regard increasing the production of autumn vegetables as a major economic and political task at present. Municipal-level government organizations have made specific arrangements. The various bureaus of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee have uniformly established vegetable production offices, planning for each person to produce 450 jin of vegetables. In addition to opening up vegetable production bases in the suburbs, the bureaus are also using the open spaces around office buildings to plant vegetables. In Haidian District, 116 colleges, universities, and government organizations have purchased more than 1,100 jin of vegetable seeds and used the “ten edges” (i.e., edges of fields, roads, etc.) and vegetable bases to plant more than 1,400 mu of autumn vegetables. In Pinggu County, all units have used vacant land to plant more than 1,300 mu of radishes.

The workers and staff of various factories and mines are also taking active action. The Beijing Cement Experimental Factory has successively harvested more than 16,000 jin of vegetables since the beginning of this year and has recently opened up 18 mu of vacant land, rushing to plant autumn vegetables. The employees of the Beijing Long-Distance Bus Company have been racing against the rain in recent days to plant on vacant land at the bus depots in the near and far suburbs. All the more than 80 mu of vegetable plots opened up by the entire company have been planted with autumn vegetables. While continuing to look for every corner of land, the workers and staff are dividing up the responsibilities and strengthening the field management of the already planted autumn vegetables.

The Beijing Forestry College has planted autumn vegetables on about 70 mu of vacant land on campus. Recently, teachers and students have continued to look for all cultivable land to rush to plant autumn vegetables. The party branch secretaries of each department personally investigate vacant land, find blank spots, and plant immediately. The Posts and Telecommunications Institute has established a sideline production group specifically responsible for planting vegetables and other tasks. These past few days, they have been looking for land everywhere in the institute and then uniformly allocating it to teachers and students for planting. Now, all the land in front of and behind the school buildings, dormitories, and roadsides that can be planted has been plowed and is about to be sown with vegetable seeds.

The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing have launched a mass movement to plant on the "ten edges," using all available time in recent days to open up vacant land in front of and behind houses, along the edges of sports fields, and beside small roads. More than 110 mu have now been opened up, most of which have been planted with autumn vegetables. While reclaiming wasteland, all the officers and soldiers of the Third Detachment are also seizing upon accumulating fertilizer, accumulating more than 8,000 dan of fertilizer in two days.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 22nd – The people's communes in the suburbs of Guangzhou are vigorously promoting vegetable production and widely carrying out a vegetable production campaign of "high yield, good quality, multiple varieties, and balanced market supply." With the active promotion of a series of effective measures taken by the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, vegetable production in the suburbs of Guangzhou is continuing to develop. After entering the third quarter, the area and varieties of vegetable planting have increased compared to the second quarter. By mid-July, the city had planted more than 60 types of summer and autumn vegetables, covering an area of more than 170,000 mu. More than 100 agricultural production brigades in the suburbs, mainly engaged in vegetable cultivation, are working hard to cultivate high-quality vegetable varieties in order to meet the requirements of "high yield, good quality, and multiple varieties," establishing special variety bases at all levels, and actively expanding the production of famous and valuable varieties and condiment varieties. The Xin'jiao Commune has also selected experienced vegetable farmers to be specifically responsible for the field management of vegetable seed retention fields, preparing conditions for the continued development of the production of superior varieties of vegetables in the future.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to vegetable production in Guangzhou. Responsible cadres such as Wen Minsheng, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhao Wucheng, Acting First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee, have separately gone deep into the people's communes and production teams in the suburbs to inspect the current vegetable production situation and made specific instructions on the varieties and labor arrangements for summer and autumn vegetables. The first secretaries of the district committees in Guangzhou and the leading cadres at all levels on the agricultural front have also gone deep into the communes, production teams, and fields to specifically help the production team cadres and guide vegetable production.

    北京开展全民种菜运动  广州抓蔬菜高产多品种
    新华社22日讯　北京市各机关、工厂、学校、部队积极响应中共中央、国务院和中共北京市委大种秋菜的号召，掀起了人人动手见缝插针大种秋菜的高潮。这几天，许多单位趁着雨后地湿播种秋菜的大好时机，组织人力开荒除草，整地修畦，已经播下了第一批菜籽。
    各单位都把增产秋季蔬菜当做当前一项重大的经济任务和政治任务。市级各机关都做了具体布置。北京市人民委员会各局统一成立了蔬菜生产办公室，计划每人生产四百五十斤蔬菜。各局除在郊区开辟蔬菜生产基地外，还利用办公楼房四周的空地种上蔬菜。海淀区已有一百十六个院校和机关单位买了一千一百多斤菜籽，利用“十边”和蔬菜基地种了一千四百多亩秋菜。平谷县各单位已利用空闲地种了一千三百多亩萝卜。
    各厂矿企业的职工也积极行动起来。北京市水泥试验厂今年以来已陆续收获蔬菜一万六千多斤，近日又开出空闲地十八亩，正在抢种秋菜。北京市长途汽车公司职工，连日来在近郊和远郊各车场的空地上冒雨抢种。全公司开辟的八十多亩菜地，已全部种上秋菜，职工们一面继续寻找边边角角的土地，一面分片包干加强已种秋菜的田间管理。
    北京林学院在校内约七十亩的空地上种上了秋菜。最近师生们又继续找一切可耕地抢种秋菜。各系的党总支书记亲自调查闲地，找到空白点，马上就种。邮电学院设了一个副业生产组，专门负责种菜等工作。这几天，他们在学院内到处找地，然后统一分配给师生种。现在，校舍、宿舍前后和路边凡是能种的地，都已经翻整好，就要撒菜种。
    中国人民解放军驻京某部全体官兵掀起了一个群众性的大种“十边”运动，连日来利用一切空闲时间在房前房后，运动场边、小路旁等地方开辟空地，现已开出一百一十多亩，多半都已种上秋菜。三支队全体官兵在开荒的同时，还大抓积肥，他们在两天内就积肥八千多担。
    新华社广州22日电　广州市郊各人民公社，大抓蔬菜生产，广泛开展“高产、优质、多品种、均衡上市”的蔬菜生产运动。在中共广州市委采取一系列有效措施积极促进的情况下，广州郊区蔬菜生产正在继续发展。进入第三季度以后，蔬菜种植面积、品种等都比第二季度有了增加。到7月中旬为止，全市已种夏秋菜六十多种，面积达十七万多亩。市郊各公社一百多个以种植蔬菜为主的农业生产大队，为了实现“高产、优质、多品种”的要求，正在大抓特抓蔬菜优质品种的育苗工作，层层建立特殊品种基地，积极扩大名贵品种和调味品种的生产。新滘公社还挑选了有经验的菜农专门负责蔬菜留种田的田间管理工作，为今后继续发展优良品种蔬菜的生产准备条件。
    各级党委对广州市的蔬菜生产非常重视，中共广东省委书记文敏生、广州市委代理第一书记赵武成等负责干部，都分别深入市郊的人民公社、生产队，检查当前的蔬菜生产情况，并对夏秋季蔬菜的品种、劳动力安排作了具体指示。广州各区的区委第一书记，和农业战线的各级领导干部也深入到公社、生产队和田头等地，具体帮助生产队干部，指导蔬菜生产。
