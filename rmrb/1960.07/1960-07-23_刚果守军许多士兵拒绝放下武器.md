Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Matadi: After UN troops entered the port of Matadi in Lower Congo on the 20th in the name of "maintaining order," many Congolese garrison soldiers refused to lay down their arms to the UN troops and left the port with their weapons and equipment. According to Agence France-Presse, this group of troops has turned to guerrilla warfare.

As previously reported, Belgian aggressor troops launched multiple armed attacks on the port of Matadi, which has significant strategic value, in an attempt to control it, but were repelled by the heroic Congolese soldiers and civilians. Now, this strategic port, defended by the Congolese soldiers and civilians for ten days, has been "taken over" by UN troops on the 21st in the name of "maintaining order."

However, facts show that it was not the Congolese soldiers and civilians who disrupted the "order" of this port, but the brutal Belgian aggressor troops. According to reports from the British "Daily Mail" and "Daily Telegraph" on the 21st, the Belgian aggressor troops carried out a frantic attack on this port and committed heinous crimes. On July 11th alone, nineteen Africans were killed and thirty-two were wounded.

According to these two newspapers, the Belgians all left the port of Matadi on the orders of their consulate on the second day (July 9th) after the Congolese soldiers launched a struggle against the continued rule of Belgian officers in the Congolese army. On the evening of the 10th, the Belgian authorities mobilized warships and launched an attack on the city, which no longer had any Belgians, early on the 11th under the pretext of "evacuating overseas Chinese." The "Daily Telegraph" reporter described the scene at the time: "Four Belgian warships fired on Matadi from the Congo River, Belgian soldiers attacked Congolese people in the city streets, and Belgian planes bombed the city from the air."

The newspaper also reported that vehicles destroyed by Belgian machine guns were everywhere on the streets of Matadi. Everyone in a Congolese public security force vehicle was killed by the Belgians, and the running board of the car was covered with congealed blood. Four Congolese policemen were killed by the Belgians while hiding in a small room. Near a building on the port, there were several pieces of human skin, and the ground was covered with congealed blood.

At the same time, according to an Associated Press report from Matadi on the 21st, no Europeans were killed in Matadi.

These facts powerfully expose the atrocities of the Belgian colonialists in creating pretexts to invade Congolese territory and massacre the Congolese people.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Brussels: The government of the Republic of the Congo expelled three Belgian colonialists from Stanleyville, the capital of the Eastern Province, on the 21st. The three men were accused of plotting against the Congolese state. They are: Goffin, the former Belgian colonial governor of the Eastern Province, Depouter, the former colonial mayor of Stanleyville, and D'Liedul, the Belgian secretary of the Eastern Provincial Government.

At the same time, an Associated Press reporter who was active in the Stanleyville area fled to Uganda for fear of "immediate arrest."

According to earlier reports, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba announced to the Congolese Parliament that a group of colonialists were creating chaos in the Eastern Province and carrying out conspiracies against the Republic.

According to reports from Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, Kasongo, Speaker of the Congolese House of Representatives, read a letter in Parliament on the 20th, exposing that some Belgian colonial officers colluded with certain people in the Congo to attempt to assassinate Lumumba and other leaders of the Republic of the Congo, thereby overthrowing the young Republican government.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, July 22nd: The Guinean government today sent a battalion of troops to the Congo to support the Congolese people's struggle against Belgian colonialism.

According to a broadcast by Guinean Radio on the 18th, Guinea had expressed its willingness to send troops to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, but was rejected. Sékou Touré telegraphed Hammarskjöld on the 17th to question this, and stated that if Guinea's troops were not allowed to participate in the UN forces, Guinea would send troops on its own.

According to reports, Hammarskjöld had no choice but to agree to Guinea's dispatch of troops after this.

    联合国军队以“维持秩序”为名“接管”马塔迪港
    刚果守军许多士兵拒绝放下武器
    刚果政府驱逐三个比利时殖民官员出境　几内亚派遣军队支持刚果人民
    新华社22日讯　马塔迪消息：在联合国军20日进入下刚果的马塔迪港之后，许多刚果守军拒绝向联合国军放下武器，并且携带着武器和装备离开了这座港口。据法新社报道说，这批军队已转入打游击。
    前已报道，比利时侵略军为控制具有重大战略价值的马塔迪港，曾经向这个港口进行了多次武装攻击，但是都被英勇的刚果军民所击退。现在，这座为刚果军民捍卫了十天之久的战略港口，已在21日被联合国军队以“维持秩序”为名而“接管”。
    但是，事实说明，破坏这座港口“秩序”的不是刚果军民，而是残暴的比利时侵略军。据英国“每日邮报”和“每日电讯报”21日的消息透露，比利时侵略军曾经对这座港口进行了疯狂的袭击，犯下了滔天罪行。仅在7月11日，就有十九名非洲人被打死，三十二人被打伤。
    据这两家报纸报道说，在刚果士兵掀起斗争反对比籍军官继续留在刚果军队中统治他们的第二天（7月9日），比利时人就遵照其领事馆的命令全部离开了马塔迪港。10日晚上，比利时当局就调集了军舰，并在11日一早借口“撤侨”向这座已经没有比利时人的城市发动了进攻。“每日电讯报”记者报道当时的情景说：“四艘比利时军舰从刚果河上向马塔迪开火射击，比利时士兵在市内大街上攻击刚果人，同时比利时飞机在空中轰炸这座城市”。
    这家报纸还报道，在马塔迪的街道上，到处是被比利时机关枪射毁的车辆。一辆刚果公安部队的汽车里的所有人都被比利时人打死，汽车踏脚板上洒满了已经凝固的鲜血。有四名刚果警察躲在一间不大的房间里也被比利时人打死。在港口上的一座楼房附近有几块人皮，地上是一片凝固了的鲜血。
    与此同时，据美联社21日自马塔迪报道，在马塔迪，没有一名欧洲人被杀死。
    这些事实有力地揭穿了比利时殖民主义者制造借口侵略刚果领土、屠杀刚果人民的暴行。
    据新华社22日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：刚果共和国政府21日把三名比利时殖民主义者从东方省首府斯坦利维尔驱逐出境。这三个人被控阴谋反对刚果国家。他们是：前东方省比利时殖民总督戈芬、前斯坦利维尔市殖民市长德普尔特和东方省政府比籍秘书德列杜尔。
    与此同时，一名到斯坦利维尔地区活动的美联社记者，由于担心“立即被捕”，已逃往乌干达。
    据早些时候的消息，刚果总理卢蒙巴曾向刚果议会宣布，一批殖民者正在东方省制造混乱，进行反对共和国的阴谋活动。
    据来自刚果首都利奥波德维尔的消息说，刚果众议院议长卡松戈20日在议会宣读了一封来信，揭露一些比利时殖民军官勾结刚果国内某些人企图谋杀卢蒙巴等刚果共和国领导人，从而推翻年轻的共和国政府。
    据新华社科纳克里22日电　几内亚政府今天把一营军队派赴刚果，支持刚果人民反对比利时殖民主义者的斗争。
    据几内亚电台18日广播，几内亚曾向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德表示几内亚愿意出兵，但是遭到拒绝。塞古·杜尔为此在17日打电报向哈马舍尔德责问，并表示如不同意几内亚部队参加联合国部队，几内亚将自己出兵。
    据报道，在这之后，哈马舍尔德才不得不表示同意几内亚出兵。
