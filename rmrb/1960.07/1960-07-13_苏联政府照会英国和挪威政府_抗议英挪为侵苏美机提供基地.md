Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 12th: According to TASS, the Soviet government lodged strong protests with the British and Norwegian governments on July 11th, protesting against their provision of their territories to the United States for aggressive activities against the Soviet Union. These protests were delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to the diplomatic envoys of these two countries to the Soviet Union on the same day. In its note to the British government, the Soviet government stated that the British government, by providing its territory to the United States as a military base, allowing the U.S. Air Force to carry out aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, has become a direct accomplice in such aggressive actions. Therefore, it bears serious responsibility for the consequences that may arise from these actions.

The note stated that, given that this border violation was crushed in its initial stage, the Soviet government considers it possible to limit itself to destroying the aircraft that violated the border and handing over the surviving crew members to the court for severe punishment in accordance with Soviet law. The Soviet government lodged a firm protest with the British government and issued an extremely serious warning that continued provocative actions by U.S. aircraft operating from British territory could lead to dangerous consequences.

The note to the Norwegian government pointed out that Norwegian territory was once again used by the United States to carry out aggressive activities against the Soviet Union after the Norwegian government, in its reply note of May 27th this year, assured the Soviet government that it would take all possible measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The note stated that, in this way, the Norwegian government has once again placed itself in the position of an accomplice to the aggressive actions taken by U.S. aircraft against the Soviet Union. This shows that the Norwegian government has taken a puzzlingly frivolous attitude toward the assessment of the U.S. aggression against the Soviet Union and the assessment of the consequences that such actions may bring to the cause of peace as a whole, and in particular to the Norwegian people. The note lodged a firm protest with the Norwegian government and expressed the hope that the Norwegian government would seriously weigh the situation that has formed and draw all the necessary conclusions.

### 苏联政府照会英国和挪威政府　抗议英挪为侵苏美机提供基地

　　苏联政府照会英国和挪威政府
　　抗议英挪为侵苏美机提供基地
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在7月11日向英国和挪威两国政府提出强硬的抗议照会，抗议它们把自己的领土提供给美国对苏联进行侵略活动。上述照会已由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在当天分别交给这两国驻苏联的外交使节。苏联政府在给英国政府的照会中说，英国政府把本国领土提供给美国作军事基地，让美国空军来实现对苏联的侵略行动，这就成为这种侵略行动的直接同谋者。因此，它对这种行动可能产生的后果负有严重的责任。
    照会说，鉴于这次破坏边境的行动在最初阶段就被粉碎，苏联政府认为有可能只限于消灭侵犯国境的飞机，并将活着的机上人员交付法庭，按照苏联的法律予以严惩。苏联政府向英国政府提出坚决抗议，并极其严重地警告英国政府，从英国领土上进行活动的美国飞机的挑衅行动继续下去，可能导致危险后果。
    在给挪威政府的照会中指出，挪威领土这一次被美国继续用来对苏联进行侵略活动，是在挪威政府在今年5月27日的复照中向苏联政府保证采取一切可能的措施来防止将来发生类似事件以后发生的。照会说，这样，挪威政府就再一次使自己处于美国飞机对苏联采取的侵略行动的同谋者的地位。这说明，挪威政府抱着十分令人不解的轻率态度对待对美国侵略苏联的行动的评价和对这种行动可能给整个和平事业、特别是给挪威人民招致的后果的评价。照会向挪威政府提出坚决的抗议，并表示希望挪威政府能极其严肃地权衡一下所形成的情况并作出一切必要的结论。
