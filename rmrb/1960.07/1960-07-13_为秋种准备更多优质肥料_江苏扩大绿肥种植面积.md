Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 12th:

　　Jiangsu is making every effort to expand the sowing area of summer green manure to prepare more high-quality base fertilizer for autumn planting. To date, the province has sown 1.14 million mu of summer green manure.

　　Jiangsu Province's green manure planting area has greatly developed in recent years. In order to quickly and fundamentally solve the fertilizer (especially refined fertilizer and base fertilizer) problem and promote large-scale and substantial increases in grain and cotton production, so as to achieve the grain and cotton targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee recently put forward the call to "grasp fertilizer like grasping water conservancy, plant green manure like planting grain, and run pig farms like running factories."

　　Various localities have properly resolved the contradiction between summer green manure and summer and autumn grain crops in terms of crop rotation and season, and have expanded the sowing area of green manure. In the Huaihe River northern mixed grain areas, the Xuzhou and Huaiyin Special Zones have used the row spacing of summer corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts and other crops to interplant mung beans and sesame; in the later stage of early autumn crops such as spring corn, sorghum, and millet, they have interplanted cowpeas, mung beans, and mixed beans and other green manures. In the lake and swamp areas of Donghai, Suining, Pixian, and Shuyang counties, the soil is barren, and most of them only grow one crop of wheat a year, and the yield has always been very low. This year, after the wheat harvest, the people's communes in these areas have turned idle summer fields into summer green manure fields, planting crops such as mung beans and cowpeas, which not only prepared more high-quality base fertilizer for autumn planting, but also improved low-yielding soil.

　　In the paddy rice producing areas of Jiangnan and Subei Lixiahe, full use has been made of "ten-side" gaps and mulberry forest land to grow green manure, cultivate aquatic green manure on the water surface of rivers, lakes, ditches, and ponds, and harvest a large amount of aquatic plants. The Suzhou Special Zone has a vast water area and many types of aquatic green manure. Of the more than 5 million mu of water area in the district, about 2 million mu can be used to harvest aquatic plants. In the past, most of the water area in the district was not fully utilized. This time, through discussions, the members of the paddy field areas realized that planting and harvesting a large amount of aquatic plants is an important way to solve the fertilizer problem in the paddy field areas, and they began to make plans and take action. After a few days of intensive effort, Wujiang County has cultivated more than 62,000 mu of aquatic green manure, nearly doubling the total area cultivated last year; at the same time, it has harvested 1.01 million dan of wild aquatic plants.

　　While properly arranging crop rotations, various localities have resolved the difficulty of insufficient summer green manure seeds by adopting measures such as exchanging grain for seeds, clearing county, commune, and team warehouses, and mutual adjustment between communes and teams, in the spirit of "planting whatever is available." Various localities have conscientiously implemented yield-increasing measures such as rational close planting, careful cultivation and intensive farming, and using fertilizer to nourish fertilizer, and implemented a "three guarantees and one reward" system, determined to plant and manage green manure well.

### 为秋种准备更多优质肥料　江苏扩大绿肥种植面积

　　江苏扩大绿肥种植面积
    新华社南京12日电　江苏各地千方百计扩大夏绿肥的播种面积，为秋种准备更多的优质基肥。到目前为止，全省已播种夏绿肥一百一十四万亩。
    江苏省的绿肥种植面积几年来有很大发展。为了迅速从根本上解决肥料（特别是精肥和基肥）问题，促进粮棉产量大面积、大幅度增长，以提前实现全国农业发展纲要的粮棉指标，江苏省委最近又提出了“像抓水利一样抓肥料，像种粮食一样种绿肥，像办工厂一样办养猪场”的号召。
    各地妥善解决夏绿肥与夏、秋粮食作物的茬口、季节矛盾，扩大绿肥的播种面积。淮北杂谷区的徐州、淮阴两个专区利用夏玉米、山芋、花生等作物的株行间隙，间种绿豆、芝麻；在春玉米、高粱、谷子等早秋作物的后期，套种了爬豆、绿豆、杂豆等绿肥。东海、睢宁、邳县、沭阳等县的湖荡地区，土质瘠薄，大都是一年只种一季麦子，产量一向很低。今年麦收后，这些地区的人民公社将夏闲田变为夏绿肥田，种上了绿豆、爬豆等作物，既为秋种准备了更多的优质基肥，又改良了低产土壤。
    江南和苏北里下河地区的水稻产区，充分利用“十边”隙地、桑棵林地种绿肥，在河湖沟塘水面培植水生绿肥，大捞水草。苏州专区水面广阔，水生绿肥的种类很多。全区五百多万亩水面，有二百万亩左右可以捞水草。过去，全区大部分水面都没有充分利用起来，这次水田地区的社员们通过讨论，认识到大种大捞水草是解决水田地区肥料问题的重要办法，边做规划，边行动起来。吴江县经过几天突击，已经培植了六万二千多亩水生绿肥，比去年培植的总面积增加近一倍；同时，已捞上野生水草一百零一万担。
    各地在妥善安排茬口的同时，根据“有什么种什么”的精神，采取以粮换种，清理县、社、队仓库，社、队之间互相调剂等办法，解决了夏季绿肥种子不足的困难。各地认真贯彻执行了合理密植、精耕细作和以肥养肥等增产措施，实行“三包一奖”，决心把绿肥种好管好。
