    Vietnamese Truck Pulls Ten Trailers
    The Vietnamese State-run Motor Transport Company recently succeeded for the first time in long-distance heavy-duty transportation by pulling ten trailers with one truck. This is a new achievement in the campaign recently launched by the Vietnamese transportation department to improve transportation capacity and efficiency. The truck pulled ten trailers, forming a train that was fifty meters long. On the first trip, it carried twenty-two tons of coal from Taiyuan to Yuechi, traveling one hundred and two kilometers. After unloading, it carried twenty-two tons of bricks from Yuechi back to Taiyuan the next day. Most of the route was in mountainous areas, with winding roads and a total of fourteen large and small bridges.

    越南一辆载重汽车牵引十辆拖车
    越南国营汽车运输公司最近第一次以一辆载重汽车牵引十辆拖车进行远程载重运输成功。这是越南运输部门最近展开的提高运输能力和效率运动的一个新成就。这辆载重汽车牵引十辆拖车，联成长达五十米的长列车。第一程载着二十二吨煤从太原开往越池，行驶一百零二公里。卸下后，第二天又载着二十二吨砖从越池回到太原。全程大部分是在山区，道路弯曲，经过大小桥梁共十四座。
