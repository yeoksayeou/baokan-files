The People's Liberation Army contributes labor and technology

    A certain unit of the PLA stationed in the Huiyang area of Guangdong Province actively supports rural people's communes with labor, technology, and experience, which has greatly promoted the development of local agricultural production.
    In the first half of this year, they contributed more than 260,000 labor days, helping the communes with rush planting, rush sowing, drought resistance, and flood control, accumulating and contributing more than 190,000 dan of fertilizer. They completed more than 460,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work on 45 large and small water conservancy projects covering an irrigation area of more than 600,000 mu, and opened and repaired more than 20 canals. In addition to temporary crash assistance, they also adopted methods such as "inviting in," "sending out," and "combining both" to provide continuous support in terms of technology and leadership experience. In the first half of the year, they trained hundreds of technical personnel for the communes, dispatched 1,803 vehicles, and permanently dispatched 104 vehicles to support agricultural transportation and water conservancy construction. Within six months, they sent more than 580 cadres to participate in grassroots leadership work in five counties, 19 communes, and one reservoir. At a certain water conservancy infrastructure construction site, the command structure lacked experience in organizing large-scale operations. The troop work team, according to the opinions of the construction site Party committee, assigned members to various departments of the construction site leading body, taking on various positions to strengthen organizational leadership, which accelerated the construction progress and was praised by the construction site Party committee.

    解放军献劳力献技术
    广东惠阳地区驻军某部积极以劳力、技术和经验支援农村人民公社，对当地农业生产的发展起了很大的促进作用。
    今年上半年，他们已出了二十六万多劳动日，帮助各公社进行抢插抢种、抗旱防洪等农事活动，积肥献肥十九万多担，在灌溉面积达六十多万亩的大小四十五项水利工程上完成土石方四十六万多立方米，开修水渠二十余处。除了临时性突击帮助外，还采取了“请进来”、“派出去”和“两结合”等方式，从技术上、领导经验上进行不间断的支援。他们在上半年已给公社培养了各种技术人员数百名，出动汽车一千八百零三辆次，并长期派出汽车一百零四辆，支援农业运输和水利建设。半年内派出干部五百八十多人，分别到五个县、十九个公社和一个水库，参加基层领导工作。某水利基本建设工地，指挥机构缺乏组织大兵团作战的经验，部队工作队按工地党委的意见，将成员分到工地领导机关各部门，担任各种职务，加强了组织领导工作，使施工进度迅速加快，受到工地党委的赞扬。
