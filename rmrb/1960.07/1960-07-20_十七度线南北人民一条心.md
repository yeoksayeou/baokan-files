Visiting Vietnam - Correspondence

　　People on Both Sides of the 17th Parallel Are of One Heart
　　Yang Dan, Xing Yan, Zhou Sheng
　  Two Worlds on the Banks of the Ben Hai River
    A month ago, we visited the Vinh Linh Special Zone, directly under the jurisdiction of the Central Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Ben Hai River, marking the temporary military demarcation line—the 17th parallel north—flows eastward for sixty kilometers from the dense forests of the Truong Son Mountains, traversing southern Vinh Linh and entering the sea at Song Mon. Standing on the high ground of Vinh Linh, looking south, one can see the Ben Hai River shimmering with white light, flowing quietly under the Hien Luong Bridge. On the north bank, under the high-flying golden star red flag, fruit trees provide shade, and green rice seedlings fill the fields, with members of the agricultural cooperatives driving water buffalo to plow the land; the south bank is a dry, yellow land overrun with weeds.
    Although both face the South China Sea to the east and the Truong Son Mountains to the west, the two banks of the Ben Hai River are two different worlds. The north bank has continuous bumper harvests, while the south bank suffers from continuous famine. Last autumn, this area encountered severe floods and pests. Cadres on the north bank, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Republic government, immediately went to the front line of production, helping farmers drain floods, fight waterlogging, eliminate pests, and rush to harvest, saving 90% of the rice fields from disaster, and the rice yield even exceeded the bumper year of 1958. On the south bank, farmers were forced by the American-Diem clique to participate in so-called "anti-communist study," and the rice fields were submerged for more than twenty days without anyone taking care of them, resulting in a rare famine. The people had no choice but to cook rice seeds to stave off hunger.
    On the night of our arrival in Vinh Linh, at Vinh Linh City, the seat of the District Administrative Committee, the amateur art troupe of Ho She Middle School was performing in an open-air theater. The stage was brightly lit, and one exciting program followed another: poetry recitations, choral performances, folk dances, fairy tales... Warm applause and laughter rippled through the theater. Comrade Tran Nguyet, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee, told us that during festivals, the people of Vinh Linh sing, dance, and celebrate together, and such evenings are also often held. However, on the same night, in the demilitarized zone on the south bank not far from here, a deathly silence prevailed, and people were confined to their homes. According to statistics, the south bank of the Ben Hai River is under martial law for seven months of the year. This time, the martial law was announced by the American-Diem clique on April 15th, prohibiting people from going out after 6:00 p.m. every day, and anyone who violated it would be arrested immediately.
      The Dividing Line Cannot Separate the Hearts of the People
    The final declaration of the Geneva Accords clearly stipulates that the military demarcation line is a temporary line and should in no way be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary. However, since 1955, the American-Diem clique has cut off free passage through the temporary military demarcation line, attempting to deceive people from understanding the truth about the north and south and to divide Vietnam for a long time. Although the people on the north bank of the Ben Hai River live a life of plenty, many suffer from the pain of families being torn apart and loved ones being separated. There is a Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative on the north bank, whose members are all from the south, and many of them have family members and relatives in the south bank. Le Xuan, a member of the cooperative, whose home can be seen from the north bank, said:
  “For five years, I haven’t been able to see my father, brothers, and sisters, nor have I heard any news from them.” Cooperative member Tran Ngoc said with grief and indignation that his mother, because of her old age and inconvenience, remained on the south bank, and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army actually kidnapped her on the charge of "children in North Vietnam." The American-Diem clique even deprives the people of the right to communicate.
    The American-Diem clique has exhausted all kinds of despicable means in an attempt to separate the Vietnamese people for a long time. In the areas of Quang Tri and Thua Thien south of the Ben Hai River, they even forced women whose husbands were in the north to participate in so-called "re-marriage studies," forcing them to divorce and remarry others. At these study sessions, women sternly denounced the enemy, expressing their firm belief that the motherland would be unified, and questioned, "Where in the world is there such a reactionary system that forces women to remarry!" The lackeys of the American-Diem clique were speechless when asked, and became furious, inflicting barbaric torture and punishment on them.
    However, the people on both sides of the military demarcation line share the same breath, the same fate, and the same heart. They are wholeheartedly for the unification of the motherland and wholeheartedly for socialism. This cannot be separated by any tyrannical suppression and persecution. When special agents dispatched by the American-Diem clique set fire to 150 houses in Yong'an Township on the north bank, the people on the south bank, seeing the fire, risked their lives, broke through the enemy's blockade, rowed over to rescue them, and cut down a lot of firewood, floating it across the Ben Hai River to help the victims rebuild their homes together with the people on the north bank. The people of Vinh Linh also produced many items to support their suffering compatriots in the south. All agricultural production cooperatives in the area have specially planted "Southern Fields," leaving all the "relief grain" they harvested for them, without eating a single grain themselves; many cooperatives also raised "Southern Chickens" and "Southern Ducks"; the members of the Vinh Linh Iron and Woodworking Production Cooperative specially manufactured hundreds of "51" style walking plows for the farmers in the south. These items, containing infinite deep affection, cannot be sent to the south now, but the people of Vinh Linh firmly believe that one day, their compatriots in the south will see them with their own eyes.
      A Brilliant Socialist Star
    "Build a socialist north as a solid foundation for unifying the motherland!" This call from the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Republic government has been universally deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and in Vinh Linh, a warm patriotic competition has also been launched everywhere. At the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative, the members put forward the slogan of "turning hatred into strength," and quickly transformed the 23 hectares of the worst soil into the best land in the area. President Ho Chi Minh issued them commemorative medals to reward them.
    At the Ben Hai Farm, workers and soldiers put forward the fighting slogan: "Raise your hoes and strike at the American aggressors and the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem!" The entire farm was full of fighting spirit and high morale. If there were not enough tools, they would make them themselves; if there were not enough houses, they would build them themselves. In order to gain time to rush to plant rubber saplings, many people did not sleep at night, lit torches, sang war songs, and reclaimed wasteland. The farm was boiling day and night, and its appearance was changing day and night. The farm director took us to the high ground near the revolutionary martyrs' memorial tower. Looking around, we saw ten hectares of rubber saplings, very strong; one thousand pepper plants and thirty hectares of lemongrass, a patch of emerald green. In front of a tall rubber tree, we stopped. The farm director pointed to the milky white rubber juice spiraling from the trunk into the porcelain jar and said, our "experimental field" has also been successful, and the quality of the rubber is very good. The French colonists had conducted many years of experiments here and finally concluded that rubber could not be produced north of the 17th parallel, but these overage rubber trees they left behind, after the farm's cultivation, have completely broken their conclusion.
    Vinh Linh is full of prosperity everywhere, and Vinh Linh is radiating the brilliance of socialism. Rice mills, sawmills, flour mills... one by one appeared in this poor and remote area where there used to be no machines; the District Administrative Committee also decided to expand the power plant that brings light and heat to the people of Vinh Linh this year, increasing its power generation capacity by one and a half times. Vinh Linh has now built five middle schools and twenty-four primary schools, and including those participating in cultural studies, one out of every four adults is participating in learning; the work of eliminating illiteracy was basically completed as early as the end of 1958.
    During the period of French colonial rule, Vinh Linh was the poorest and most bitter county in Quang Tri Province, and the people could not even eat enough miscellaneous grains and wild vegetables. Some families were so poor that the husband and wife only had one pair of torn pants. However, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Republic government, Vinh Linh has taken on a new look. Among the 65,700 people in the area, according to a survey from the year before last, people who eat rice all year round without eating miscellaneous grains already account for two-thirds; on average, everyone has two sets of clothes. The situation where people and livestock lived together is no longer visible. In the coconut groves and orchards, we saw many residents' houses newly built of bamboo, which were very elegant. Now, not only have the several diseases that were prevalent in the past rarely been found, but the main vector of local infectious diseases—fleas—has been completely eliminated. The people praised this as a miracle created by the socialist system.
    This earth-shaking change in the lives of the people of Vinh Linh is closely linked to the victory of socialist transformation. At present, 94.6% of the working farmers in the district have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and those in the plains who have joined advanced cooperatives account for 43%. The victory of collectivization has powerfully promoted production. Last year, the average rice yield per hectare in the district reached 1.9 tons, nearly double that before the restoration of peace.
    Vinh Linh, a brilliant socialist star, attracts the people on the south bank who have been pushed into the abyss of suffering by the American-Diem clique.
    The Struggles of the People on Both Sides Echo Each Other
    The people of Vinh Linh, who are advancing victoriously on the socialist road, deeply feel that the American-Diem clique, which is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations on the other side of the Ben Hai River, is jealous of their brilliant achievements and constantly threatens their security; they deeply feel that the American-Diem clique is dividing their motherland and persecuting their relatives, and this deep hatred must be avenged. Therefore, the struggle against the American-Diem clique has unfolded in Vinh Linh in a variety of forms. In factories, in cooperatives, in schools, in organs, and in the fields, the masses often hold various gatherings to accuse the American-Diem clique of its crimes and express their determination and confidence in striving for the unification of the motherland. In many agricultural production cooperatives, although the anti-American-Diem clique congresses were over, the members continued to shout slogans and went to the fields to cultivate while leading livestock and carrying farm tools.
      "Yankee imperialism, get out of South Vietnam!"
      "Down with the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem!"
    The roar of the people of Vinh Linh and the roar of all the people of northern Vietnam converged, resounding on both sides of the Ben Hai River. This voice cannot be blocked by the temporary military demarcation line. This voice represents the unanimous determination and confidence of all the Vietnamese people, this voice encourages the struggle of the people on the south bank, and this voice shakes the reactionary little court of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique supported by American imperialism.
    South of the 17th parallel, the people's struggle against the American-Diem clique echoed the north bank. News from the south bank said that not long ago, when the American-Diem clique convened an "anti-communist study meeting" in Huong Rong County, Thua Thien Province, the masses refused to participate. The enemy wanted to transport "suspects" away in American military trucks, and the masses swarmed up, blocking the road, making it difficult for the enemy to move an inch. American military advisers then personally came forward to lecture, but the people saw through these robbers' deceptive lies and still ignored them. As a result, the executioners revealed their true colors and used the most vicious means. They gave everyone a photo of President Ho Chi Minh and pointed to the guillotine designed by the United States, threatening the masses and saying: "Anyone who does not tear up these photos is a communist!" Heads can be cut off, blood can flow, but the Vietnamese people's infinite love and trust in their leader cannot be changed in the slightest. The masses, rather than surrender, glared at the enemy, and instead of tearing them up, they held up the photos of President Ho. How insignificant did that handful of brutal and despicable enemies appear in the face of the indestructible heroism of the masses!
    In Son Ha County, a mountainous area of ​​Quang Ngai Province, American military advisers commanded an entire division of Ngo Dinh Diem's puppet army to conduct continuous "military sweeps." Those who opposed conscription had their heads cut off and hung on bunkers for public display. At night, the residents' houses were often surrounded by them, young people were killed, and houses were burned down. The ethnic minorities such as the Cham, Cao, and Ge Yong, who lived in this area, had no way out and were forced to move to the forest. In order to defend themselves, they ambushed automatic bows and arrows in the bushes, and the arrows would shoot out as soon as they stepped on the mechanism; they also dug deep traps filled with bamboo sticks and iron thorns, and once they fell into them, they could not think of climbing out alive. The Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army learned its lesson and was extra careful when approaching the forest. Sometimes, the monkeys in the forest would bump the branches and leaves, scaring them so much that they ran away. In January this year, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party, golden star red flags were suddenly hung on many mountain tops in this county. Two Ngo Dinh Diem puppet troops wanted to climb to a mountain top to pull down the golden star red flag, but unexpectedly they misunderstood each other and thought the other was ordinary people. They opened fire and caused a fierce battle. In one day, they killed more than 30 enemies, not counting the wounded. And that golden star red flag is still flying in the wind on the mountain top.
    Always Follow the Workers' Party and President Ho
    President Ho, the golden star red flag, are symbols of the Vietnamese people's progress from victory to victory. As long as they think of President Ho and the golden star red flag, their hearts are filled with infinite hope, and their strength becomes even stronger. The Van Kieu ethnic group living in the western mountainous area of ​​Vinh Linh on both sides of the temporary military demarcation line (here, a tributary of the Mekong River is the boundary), had no surnames in the past. After the signing of the Geneva Accords, they decided to have a surname. All the people of the ethnic group were surnamed Ho, expressing their determination to always follow the Workers' Party and President Ho. Although the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army did not allow the people on the south bank of the Ben Hai River to open their doors and windows to the north, in order to be able to see the golden star red flag flying high in the sky on the north bank, the people on the south bank opened slits in the north side walls of their houses to let in light. Every day, they looked north from these slits, and the golden star red flag flew in their eyes every day, and it flew in their hearts every day.
    One day at noon, people suddenly discovered white smoke rising from the surface of the South China Sea, but no one could guess what was causing it. Later, people learned that the matter was like this: the day before, fishermen from the south and fishermen from the north met at sea. They discussed holding a maritime celebration, with the northern fishermen bringing photos of President Ho, and the southern fishermen bringing a golden star red flag that they had collected at the time of the signing of the Geneva Accords. The next day, northern fishermen and southern fishermen sailed several sailboats and converged on the South China Sea. They raised the golden star red flag on the highest mast and hung a photo of President Ho. At exactly 12:00 noon, they burned sandalwood, and the fragrant white smoke rose straight into the sky, and the grand celebration began. This day was May 19th, President Ho Chi Minh's birthday.
    The 17th parallel cannot separate the close unity of the people of the north and the people of the south; the people on both sides of the 17th parallel are of one heart, their hearts are set on the Workers' Party, their hearts are set on President Ho, and their hearts are set on the republic where the golden star red flag flies. The 17th parallel cannot separate this self-evident truth in the hearts of all the Vietnamese people—the first sentence of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:
      "Vietnam is a unified country from Lang Son to Ca Mau."
    Now, the Vietnamese people have first focused their struggle goal on the culprit who divided Vietnam, the backer of the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem—the American aggressor. In the north and south of Vietnam, the tide of the anti-American struggle has already become one with the South China Sea. Finally, one day, the waves of this ocean will wash away the American aggressors and drown the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem. Finally, one day, there will be free passage between the north and south of the 17th parallel, and beautiful Vinh Linh will become a place where the people on both sides of the Ben Hai River can gather happily.

　　十七度线南北人民一条心
　　杨丹　邢雁　周生
　  边海河两岸两个世界
    一个月以前，我们访问了直属越南民主共和国中央政府管辖的永灵区。
    标志着临时军事分界线——北纬十七度线的边海河，从长山的密林里东流六十公里，横贯永灵南部，在松门入海。站在永灵区的高地上向南眺望，可以看见，边海河闪着白亮的水光，穿过贤良桥下，静静地流着。北岸，在高高飘扬的金星红旗下面，果树成荫，绿秧满田，农业合作社的社员们正赶着水牛耕地；南岸是一片干黄的土地，蔓延着野草。
    虽然东面都临南海，西面都是长山，但是，边海河两岸却是两种不同的世界。北岸连年丰收，南岸连年饥荒。去年秋天，这一带遇到了严重的水灾和虫害，在越南劳动党和共和国政府领导下的北岸的干部，立即走上生产第一线，帮助农民排洪、抗捞、除虫、抢收，使90％的稻田免除了灾害，稻谷产量还超过了丰收的1958年。在南岸，农民当时被美吴集团强迫去参加所谓“控共学习”，稻田被水淹没了二十多天没有人管，结果有80％的稻田全部失收，形成罕有的灾荒，老百姓只好煮谷种充饥。
    我们到达永灵的当天夜晚，在区行政委员会所在地永灵市，胡舍中学的学生业余文工团正在露天剧场表演，舞台上灯光通明，精采的节目一个接着一个：诗朗诵，大合唱，民间舞，童话剧……剧场里不时地荡漾起热烈的掌声和笑声。劳动党区委副书记陈月同志给我们说，每逢节日，永灵人民都要唱歌，跳舞，联欢，像这样的晚会也是经常举行的。但是，就在同一天夜晚，在距离这里不远的南岸非军事区，却笼罩着死一样的沉寂，人们都被囚禁在家里。据统计，边海河南岸一年中有七个月处于戒严状态。这次的戒严令是美吴集团4月15日宣布的，每天下午六点钟起，就不准老百姓出门，谁要违犯，就会立即被逮捕。
      分界线分不开人民的心
    日内瓦协议最后宣言明确规定，军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界。但是，美吴集团从1955年就切断了通过临时军事分界线的自由来往，企图这样来蒙蔽人民了解北方和南方的真象，并且长期分裂越南。边海河北岸的人民虽然过着丰衣足食的日子，许多人却承担着家庭被拆散、骨肉被分割的痛苦。北岸有个前锋农业生产合作社，社员们都是从南方来的，他们中有不少人同南岸的居民有着家属和亲戚的关系。社员黎选的家，站在北岸就可以看见，但是他说：
  “五年来，我跟父亲兄弟姐妹一面也不能见，也听不到他们一点音讯”。社员陈玉感悲愤地说，他的母亲因为年老行动不便，留在南岸，吴庭艳伪军竟然以“子女在北越”的罪名，把她绑走。美吴集团连人民通信的权利也剥夺了。
    美吴集团使尽各种可耻手段，企图长期分离越南人民。在边海河以南的广治、承天一带，他们甚至强迫丈夫在北方的妇女参加所谓“改嫁学习”，逼她们离婚，改嫁别人。在这种学习会上，妇女们义正辞严地怒斥敌人，表示了相信祖国一定会统一的坚贞意念，并且质问：“世界上哪有这样反动的制度，逼迫妇女改嫁！”美吴集团的爪牙被问得哑口无言，老羞成怒，对她们施加野蛮的拷打和刑罚。
    但是，军事分界线南北人民同呼吸、共命运，一条心。他们一心为了统一祖国，一心为了社会主义。这是任何横暴的镇压和迫害所分离不开的。当美吴集团派遣的特务，到北岸的永安乡放火烧了一百五十间民房的时候，南岸人民看见火光，冒着生命危险，冲破敌人的封锁，划船过来抢救，并且砍了许多木柴，从边海河上飘浮过来，同北岸人民一起，帮助受害者重建家园。永灵人民也生产了许多物品，支援南方苦难中的同胞。全区所有的农业生产合作社，都专门种了“南方田”，把打下的“救济粮”统统留下来，自己一粒也不吃；许多社里还养了“南方鸡”、“南方鸭”；永灵铁木工生产合作社的社员们，专门为南方农民制造了几百件“51”式步犁。这些包含着无限深情厚意的物品，虽然现在还不能送到南方去，但是永灵人民坚决相信，终于有一天，南方同胞会亲眼看到它们。
      灿烂的社会主义的星
    “建设社会主义的北方，作为统一祖国的稳固基础”！越南劳动党和共和国政府的这一号召，已经普遍深入人心，在永灵，也到处展开了热烈的爱国竞赛。在前锋农业生产合作社，社员们提出了“化仇恨为力量”的口号，把二十三公顷土质最坏的地，很快地改造成当地的一等地，胡志明主席为此发给他们纪念章，表示奖励。
    在边海农场，工人和战士提出了战斗的口号：“扬起锄头，锄锄打击美国侵略者和吴庭艳卖国贼！”全农场斗志昂扬，群情高涨。工具不够，自己造；房子不够，自己盖。为了争取时间抢种橡胶树苗，许多人夜里不睡觉，打起火把，唱着战歌，开垦荒地。农场日夜在沸腾，日夜在改变着面貌。农场场长带我们来到革命烈士纪念塔附近的高地上，举目四望，只见十公顷橡胶树的幼苗，十分茁壮；一千株胡椒和三十公顷香茅，一片翠绿。在一棵高大的橡胶树前面，我们停了下来，场长指着从树干上盘旋流到瓷缸中的乳白色的橡胶汁说，我们的这个“试验田”也成功了，橡胶的质量很好。法国殖民者曾经在这里进行了多年试验，最后下了结论，说十七度线以北不能产橡胶，但是，他们留下的这些超龄的橡胶树，经过农场的培育，已经使他们的结论全部破了产。
    永灵到处是蓬勃兴旺的景象，永灵焕发着社会主义的光辉。碾米厂，锯木厂，磨粉厂……在这片过去没有一架机器的穷乡僻壤一座座地出现了；区行政委员会还决定，今年要扩建为永灵人民带来光和热的发电厂，叫它的发电能力增加一倍半。永灵现在还盖起了五所中学和二十四所小学，把参加文化进修的计算在内，每四个成年人中间就有一个人参加学习；扫除文盲的工作，早在1958年底就基本完成了。
    在法国殖民者统治时期，永灵是广治省最穷最苦的一个县，人民连杂粮、野菜也吃不饱。有的人家穷到夫妻只有一条破裤子。但是，在越南劳动党和共和国政府领导下，永灵的面貌焕然一新。在全区六万五千七百多人当中，据前年调查，整年吃大米不吃杂粮的人已经占到三分之二；平均每人都有两套衣裳。过去人同牲畜一起居住的情形再也看不见了，在椰子林和果树园里，我们看见许多居民的房屋都是用竹子新修起来的，十分雅致。现在，不仅过去流行的几种疾病已经很少发现，而且把当地传染疾病的主要媒介——跳蚤彻底消灭了。老百姓称赞这是社会主义制度创造的奇迹。
    永灵人民生活上这种翻天复地的变化，和社会主义改造的胜利紧密地联系着。目前，全区94.6％的劳动农民都加入了农业生产合作社，平原地区加入高级社的已经占到43％。合作化的胜利，有力地促进了生产，去年全区平均每公顷稻谷产量达到一点九吨，比和平恢复以前提高了将近一倍。
    永灵，一颗灿烂的社会主义的星，招引着南岸被美吴集团推入苦难深渊的人民。
    两岸人民的斗争遥相呼应
    在社会主义道路上胜利前进的永灵人民深深地感受到：边海河对岸加紧扩军备战的美吴集团，嫉恨着他们的光辉成就，时刻威胁着他们的安全；深深地感受到：美吴集团分裂他们的祖国，迫害他们的亲人，深仇巨恨，是非报不可的。因而反对美吴集团的斗争，以各种各样的形式，在永灵汹涌澎湃的展开。在工厂，在合作社，在学校，在机关，在田野，群众经常举行各式各样的集会，控诉美吴集团的罪恶，表明他们争取祖国统一的决心和信心。在许多农业生产合作社，反对美吴集团的大会虽然开完了，社员们一边牵着牲口，带着农具，一边还继续高呼着口号，下田去耕作。
      “美帝国主义从南越滚出去！”
      “打倒吴庭艳卖国贼！”
    永灵人民的吼声和所有越南北方人民的吼声汇合起来，响彻了边海河两岸，这声音是临时军事分界线阻挡不住的。这声音表示着全体越南人民一致的决心和信心，这声音鼓舞着南岸人民的斗争，这声音震撼着美帝国主义扶植下的吴庭艳集团的反动小朝廷。
    在十七度线以南，人民反对美吴集团的斗争和北岸遥遥呼应。从南岸传来的消息说，不久以前，在承天省香荣县美吴集团召集“控共学习会”的时候，群众都拒绝参加。敌人要把
  “有嫌疑”的人用美国军用卡车运走，群众一拥而上，挡住去路，使敌人寸步难行。美国军事顾问接着亲自出面训话，可是人民看穿了这些强盗骗人的鬼话，仍然置之不理。于是，刽子手露出真面目，使用最恶毒的手段。他们给每个人一张胡志明主席的像片，并且指着美国设计的铡头机，威胁群众说：“谁要不撕毁这些像片，就是共产党！”头可断，血可流，越南人民对领袖的无限敬爱和信赖是不能丝毫改变的。群众宁死不屈，怒视着敌人，不但不撕，反而却把胡主席的像片举了起来。在群众这样坚不可摧的英雄气慨面前，那一撮残暴、卑鄙的敌人显得何等渺小啊！
    在广义省的多山地区山河县，美国军事顾问指挥整师的吴庭艳伪军，连续地进行“军事扫荡”，反对拉兵拉伕的人，头颅被他们砍下来，挂在碉堡上示众。在黑夜，居民的房屋往往被他们包围，年轻人被杀死，房屋被烧毁。聚居在这一带的占族、高族、葛用族等少数民族人民，走投无路，被迫搬到森林里去住。为了自卫，他们在树丛埋伏了自动的弓箭，一踏上机关箭就射了出来；他们还挖下深深的陷井，里面插满的竹签和铁刺，一掉进去就休想活着爬出来。吴庭艳伪军接受了教训，走到森林附近分外小心。有时候，森林里的猴子把树枝树叶撞得乱动，也吓得他们拔腿就跑。今年1月，在越南劳动党成立三十周年的日子，这个县的许多山头上，忽然都挂起了金星红旗。有两支吴庭艳伪军想爬到一个山头把金星红旗拔下来，不料他们互相发生了误会，都以为对方是老百姓，开枪射击，引起了一场激战，一天功夫就打死了三十多名敌人，挂彩的还不算。而那面金星红旗，仍然在山头上迎风招展。
    永远跟随劳动党和胡主席
    胡主席，金星红旗，是越南人民从胜利走向胜利的象征。只要想起胡主席和金星红旗，他们心里就充满无限的希望，他们的力量就显得更强大起来。居住在永灵西部山区临时军事分界线（这里以湄公河一条支流为界）南北的云桥族，过去是没有姓的，在日内瓦协议签订以后，他们决定要有一个姓，全族人民都姓胡，表示他们永远跟随劳动党和胡主席的决心。虽然吴庭艳伪军不许边海河南岸人民的门窗向北开，但是，南岸人民为了时常能看到在北岸天空高高飘扬的金星红旗，他们在房屋北边墙上打开了能够透进光亮的缝隙，每天，他们从这些缝隙向北看，金星红旗天天飘扬在他们眼里，天天飘扬在他们心里。
    有一天中午，人们忽然发现，南海海面上冒着白烟，可是谁也猜不出这是什么原因。后来人们才知道，事情是这样的：在前一天，南方的渔民和北方的渔民在海上相遇了，他们商量好，要举行一个海上庆祝联欢会，由北方渔民带来胡主席的像片，由南方渔民带来他们在日内瓦协议签订时收藏的一面金星红旗。第二天，北方渔民和南方渔民驾着好些帆船，在南海海面上汇合了。他们在一根最高的桅干上升起金星红旗，又挂起了胡主席的像片，中午十二时正，烧起了檀香木，喷香的白烟腾空直上，盛大的庆祝联欢开始了。这一天是5月19日，是胡志明主席寿辰。
    十七度线分不开北方人民和南方人民的亲密团结；十七度线南北人民一条心，心心向着劳动党，心心向着胡主席，心心向着金星红旗飘扬的共和国。十七度线分不开全体越南人民心中的这个天经地义的真理——越南民主共和国宪法的第一句：
      “越南是一个从谅山到金瓯的统一的国家。”
    现在，越南人民已经把他们的斗争目标首先集中指向分裂越南的罪魁、卖国贼吴庭艳的靠山——美国侵略者。在越南的北方和南方，反美斗争的浪潮，已经像南海一样，连成一片。终于有一天，这个海洋的浪潮要冲走美国侵略者，淹死卖国贼吴庭艳。终于有一天，十七度线南北可以自由来往，美丽的永灵会成为边海河两岸人民欢聚的地方。
