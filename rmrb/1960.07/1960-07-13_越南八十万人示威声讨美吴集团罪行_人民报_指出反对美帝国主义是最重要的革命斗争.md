Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 12th: The struggle movement of the people in North Vietnam against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, is raging like a prairie fire, burning ever more fiercely. From June 29th to July 6th, the number of people from all walks of life in North Vietnam participating in rallies and parades against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique has reached over 800,000. People in Hanoi, Thai Binh, Thai Nguyen, Haiphong, the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, and other places have successively held rallies and parades denouncing the U.S.-Ngo clique in recent days.

　　In Hanoi, more than 2,000 literary and art workers held an anti-U.S.-Ngo rally on July 10th. Dang Thai Mai, Chairman of the Vietnam Union of Literature and Arts, composer Luu Huu Phuoc, writer Nguyen Tuan, actress Ai Lien, and others strongly condemned the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo clique in destroying national unification and persecuting and massacring the people of South Vietnam and patriotic literary and art workers. All the literary and art workers participating in the rally passed letters to the literary and art workers of South Vietnam and to literary and art workers of various countries around the world, expressing their support for the heroic struggle of the people of South Vietnam and the literary and art workers of South Vietnam against the U.S.-Ngo clique, and calling on literary and art workers of conscience in all countries around the world to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the U.S.-Ngo clique.

　　While holding rallies and parades, various localities have also used various literary and artistic activities to expose the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo clique in expanding armaments and preparing for war and suppressing the people to the broad masses. The districts of Hanoi held poetry writing competitions and organized anti-U.S.-Ngo activities such as performing plays, showing movies, organizing exhibitions, broadcasting, and establishing "anti-U.S.-Ngo mobile bookstores". Various anti-U.S.-Ngo cartoons were hung on the streets of the Hanh Cao district, often attracting many people. Literacy and cultural classes and cultural improvement classes in the Bach Mai district incorporated themes of anti-U.S.-Ngo and exposing the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo into their lectures.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article today entitled "Opposing U.S. Imperialism is the Most Important Revolutionary Struggle." The article stated, "U.S. imperialism is constantly trying every possible means to deceive the people of the world and the American people. Their so-called propaganda of 'peace,' 'cooperation,' and 'friendship' are merely smokescreens released to facilitate their war and aggression activities. All the facts that have already occurred fully prove that under the pressure of public opinion, imperialism sometimes changes its tune, but the war and aggression nature of imperialism has not changed."

　　The article stated that U.S. imperialism is increasingly fully exposing itself as the most dangerous enemy of the people of the world. After condemning U.S. imperialism for destroying the Four-Power Summit Conference and the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, reviving West German and Japanese militarism, and using them as powerful tools to realize the American attack on socialist countries and peace-loving countries, the article said, "U.S. President Eisenhower's recent trip to the Far East and Southeast Asia once again fully exposed the U.S. imperialist and its running dogs' conspiracy to intensify war preparations in this region."

　　The article said, therefore, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong pointed out at the first session of the Second National Assembly of Vietnam that "the struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is one of the primary revolutionary tasks of the people of our country and the people of the world."

　　The article then emphasized, "When imperialism, headed by the United States, is intensifying its efforts to realize its ambition to dominate the world, the struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is precisely the struggle for peace, for the national independence of all countries, and for the democratic and free rights of the working class and the laboring people. The struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is precisely the struggle against aggression, suppression, and exploitation, and at the same time it is also the struggle for social progress and the victory of socialism."

　　The article continued: "The more the bellicose imperialists expose their extremely reactionary and extremely ferocious faces, the more the struggle movement against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, develops."

　　The article also described the anti-U.S. imperialist storms that have recently been stirred up in Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially in Japan, South Korea, Laos, Turkey, Cuba, and other places. The article said: "The bellicose imperialists headed by the United States are frantically carrying out war and aggression activities. However, they can never reverse the wheel of history." The article concluded by emphasizing, "We cannot subjectively underestimate the enemy, we must constantly heighten our vigilance, and always prepare our strength to defeat all the conspiracies of imperialism."

　　越南八十万人示威声讨美吴集团罪行
　　“人民报”指出反对美帝国主义是最重要的革命斗争
    新华社河内12日电　越南北方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的斗争运动势如烈火燎原，越烧越猛。从6月29日到7月6日，越南北方参加反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团集会和游行的各界人民已达八十多万人。河内、太平、太原、海防、傣族苗族自治区等地人民连日来又相继举行了声讨美吴集团的集会和游行。
    在河内，文学、艺术工作者两千多人10日举行的反美吴集会上，越南文学艺术联合会主席邓泰梅、作曲家刘有福、作家阮遵、演员爱莲等人，强烈谴责美吴集团破坏国家统一、迫害屠杀南越人民和爱国文艺工作者的罪行。参加集会的全体文艺工作者通过了写给南越文艺工作者的信和世界各国文艺工作者的信，表示支持南越人民和南越文艺工作者反对美吴集团的英勇斗争，要求世界各国有正义感的文艺工作者，支持越南人民反对美吴集团的斗争。
    在举行集会和游行的同时，各地还通过各种文艺活动，向广大群众揭露了美吴集团扩军备战、镇压人民的罪行。河内各街区举办了诗歌创作比赛和演剧、放电影、组织展览、广播和“反美吴流动书店”等反美吴活动。行草区的各个街头悬挂着各种反美吴的漫画，经常吸引了许多群众。白梅区各个扫盲文化班和文化进修班，讲课时都结合着反美吴和揭露美吴罪行的题材。
    新华社河内11日电　越南“人民报”今天发表一篇题为“反对美帝国主义是最重要的革命斗争”的文章说，“美帝国主义不断千方百计地欺骗世界人民和美国人民，它们的所谓‘和平’、‘合作’、‘友好’等宣传论调，只不过是为便于它进行战争和侵略活动放出的烟幕。所有已经发生的事实充分证明，在舆论的压力下，帝国主义有时也变换调子，但帝国主义的战争和侵略本质是没有改变的。”
    文章说，美帝国主义越来越充分暴露出它是世界人民最危险的敌人。文章在谴责了美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议和十国裁军会议，复活西德和日本的军国主义，利用它们作为实现美国进攻社会主义国家和爱好和平国家的得力工具以后说，“美国总统艾森豪威尔最近的远东和东南亚之行再一次充分暴露了美帝国主义及其走狗在这个地区加紧准备战争的阴谋。”
    文章说，因此，范文同总理在越南第二届国会第一次会议上指出了“反对帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，是我国人民和世界人民的首要革命任务之一。”
    文章接着强调指出，“当以美国为首的帝国主义正在加紧实现它们妄图作世界霸主的阴谋的时候，反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，正是为和平、为各国的民族独立、为工人阶级和劳动人民的民主自由权利的斗争。反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，正是反对侵略、镇压和剥削的斗争，同时也是为社会进步和社会主义胜利的斗争。”
    文章继续说：“好战的帝国主义越是暴露出它们极其反动、极其凶恶的嘴脸，反对帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争运动就越来越发展。
    这篇文章还叙述了最近期间在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，特别是在日本、南朝鲜、老挝、土耳其、古巴等地掀起的反对美帝国主义的风暴。文章说：“以美国为首的好战的帝国主义正在疯狂进行战争和侵略活动。但是，它们决不能倒转历史巨轮”。文章最后强调指出：“我们不能主观轻敌，我们必须不断提高警惕，时刻准备力量以击败帝国主义的一切阴谋。”
