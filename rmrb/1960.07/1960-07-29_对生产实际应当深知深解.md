On July 24th, this newspaper published news about how leading cadres of the Chongqing Standard Parts Factory went deep into the grassroots level and worked earnestly, increasing the utilization rate of innovation projects from over 50% to over 90%. Today, we are publishing news about how leading cadres of the Pingxiang Coal Mine went deep into the front line of production and earnestly solved problems, increasing the average daily output of raw coal in mid-to-late June by nearly 30% compared to the first ten days of June. These two news items illustrate a principle: improving the work style of cadres is extremely important for increasing production.

Since the Chongqing Standard Parts Factory launched the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, over 50% of the innovation projects have been used in production, yielding significant results. However, some new technologies and experiences have not been applied in production, or have been put aside after being used for a while. Why? Is it that workers are unwilling to use these new technologies? No. The main reason is that the work at the time was not deep enough, not detailed enough, and not earnest enough. They did not fully understand the problems in promoting certain new technologies, and therefore could not solve them well. Later, the leaders went deep down, solved these problems, and the situation changed dramatically. The utilization rate of innovation projects increased to over 90%, and the leap forward in production was more powerfully guaranteed. Similarly, why did the Pingxiang Coal Mine complete the state-stipulated coal production plan ahead of schedule in the first quarter of this year, but the production situation in April and May was relatively poor? The main reason was that the work of some cadres at that time was not earnest enough. Some problems that arose during the production leap forward, such as frequent failures of electromechanical equipment, transportation not keeping up with production, and tunneling lagging behind mining, were not resolved in a timely manner; or even if they were resolved, the problems recurred because they were not resolved thoroughly, which affected the continued leap forward in production. Later, the work style was improved, the leading organization moved to work underground, the leading cadres went deep into the front line of production, and the work became earnest. The problems of maintenance and repair of electromechanical equipment, transportation problems, and tunneling problems were solved to varying degrees, and the production situation also changed significantly. Look: the same factory, the same mine, but the production situation is very different due to the different work styles of the cadres before and after. The great impact of cadre work style on production is evident from this.

Why does the cadre work style have such a big impact on production? This is because leading production must first be based on the reality of production. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "No matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of the matter, its nature, its relationship with things outside it, you don't know the laws of the matter, you don't know how to do it, and you can't do it well." Leading production is also the same. Only when our plans, policies, and measures for leading production are in line with or roughly in line with the reality of production can production be done well. And an earnest work style is the prerequisite for understanding the reality of production and grasping the laws of production. We know that the laws of production are often hidden behind complex surface phenomena and cannot be seen through at a glance. Only by earnestly going deep into the reality of production can we understand the laws of production, and thus arrange our work according to the laws of production, making the subjective consistent with the objective, and doing production well. Why were some new technologies not used in production at the Chongqing Standard Parts Factory in the previous period? Did they not take measures? Of course, not. For this matter, the factory held several mobilization meetings, requiring workers to innovate one piece and use one piece; but because the work at that time was not deep enough, they did not find out the reasons why these new technologies could not be applied to production, so the measures taken did not solve the problem. Later, they found the crux of the problem, made those who were not familiar with the principles of new technologies familiar with them, and gradually improved the imperfect innovation projects. The measures were in line with the actual situation, so they solved the problems that had not been solved in the past. Why were some problems in the Pingxiang Coal Mine not well resolved in April and May? Did they not take measures? No. It was just because the work style was not earnest enough, and they only "knew the phenomena but did not understand the reasons" for the problems in production, that is, they still "did not know the laws of the matter." Therefore, although measures were taken, these measures did not conform to the reality of production, did not solve the problem, or the problem was not solved thoroughly. Conversely, when the work became deep and earnest, the crux of the problem was found, and targeted treatment was given, and each problem was solved practically, a new situation emerged in production. It can be seen that the quality of the production situation depends not only on enthusiasm, but also on whether the leadership style is deep and earnest, and whether there is a thorough understanding of the reality of production. Deep and thorough knowledge can lead to correct judgments and effective measures; superficial knowledge often leads to wrong judgments and ineffective measures. Whether it is deep and thorough knowledge or superficial knowledge is a sign of whether the work style is deep and earnest.

This significant impact of work style on production must be taken seriously by every cadre in industrial and mining enterprises. For a Communist Party member, whether the work is deep and earnest is also a matter of Party spirit. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "Oppose Party Stereotypes": "The proletariat has only one sharpest and most effective weapon, and that is a serious and militant scientific attitude." He also said: "The Communist Party does not rely on intimidation to eat, but on the truth of Marxism-Leninism, on seeking truth from facts, and on science." An earnest work style is the work style required by the scientific attitude that Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of. A floating and not earnest work style, with little understanding of the reality of production, makes it difficult to have a scientific attitude and difficult to do production well.

Now, leading cadres at all levels of industrial and mining enterprises are going to the front line of production one after another, which is an excellent thing. However, it should also be noted that going to the front line of production does not mean that the work is deep and earnest. In the past, the cadres of the Pingxiang Coal Mine often went to the front line of production, but some comrades just went to "walk around, stand for a while, take a look, and say a few words." This is certainly better than staying in the office without walking, standing, looking, or saying; but just going to "walk around, stand for a while, take a look, and say a few words," superficially, it is still impossible to truly understand the reality of production and grasp the laws of production. We advocate going deep into the front line of production, not superficially deep, but truly deep; not satisfied with "walking around, standing for a while, taking a look, and saying a few words," but taking root in production and settling down among the masses. Only in this way is going to the front line of production truly deep and has practical significance.

The issue of work style is also an issue that requires long-term attention, and it is by no means that "going deep" once or twice can solve the problem once and for all and no longer need to pay attention to it. Because production is always in a state of development, old problems are solved, and new problems will arise; even some old problems will have new developments in new situations. Are the problems that have occurred in the Pingxiang Coal Mine, such as tunneling lagging behind mining, transportation not keeping up with production, and frequent failures of electromechanical equipment, new problems? No, in recent years, in many coal mines, the same problems have occurred after the production leap forward. However, in different mines and in different situations, the specific reasons for these problems are also different. Will the Pingxiang Coal Mine not have problems such as tunneling lagging behind mining, transportation not keeping up with production, and frequent failures of electromechanical equipment in the future? Not necessarily. On the contrary, after a new leap forward in production, more working faces are needed, the amount of transportation is greater, the wear and tear of electromechanical equipment is greater, and the maintenance and repair of tunneling, transportation, and equipment are more likely to lag behind production. Since July, the production of the Pingxiang Coal Mine has encountered problems such as insufficient mining and tunneling strength and urgent need for equipment maintenance. This requires continuously going deep into the reality of production, grasping new situations, and taking specific measures in a timely manner to solve these problems, so that production can continue to leap forward.

At present, going deep into the front line of production, carrying forward the work style of combining daring to think and daring to act with earnest and hard work, and practically solving concrete problems one by one has become a trend. This new trend has had and will continue to have a huge positive effect on the continued leap forward of our production cause. It is entirely foreseeable that after great achievements have been made in production in the first half of the year, after the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has armed thousands of enterprises with new technologies, and with the cadres' work style becoming deeper, more detailed, and more earnest, a new leap in production will surely appear on the national industrial front!

### 对生产实际应当深知深解

    对生产实际应当深知深解
    7月24日，本报发表了重庆标准件厂领导干部深入基层，踏踏实实地做工作，使革新项目的利用率由50％以上提高到90％以上的新闻。今天又发表了萍乡煤矿领导干部深入生产第一线，踏踏实实解决问题，6月中旬和下旬原煤平均日产量比上旬增长了将近30％的新闻。这两条新闻，说明了一个道理：改进干部的作风对于提高生产是十分重要的。
    重庆标准件厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动以来，有50％以上的革新项目使用到生产中去，发挥了显著的成效，但是有些新技术、新经验却没有在生产中得到运用，或者用过一阵又搁下了。为什么呢？难道是工人不愿意使用这些新技术吗？不是的。主要原因是当时的工作还不够深入、不够细致、不够踏实，对于某些新技术推广中的问题不尽了解，因而也没有能很好地解决。以后领导深入下去了，解决了这些问题，情况顿然大变，革新项目的利用率提高到90％以上，生产的跃进得到更有力的保证。同样地，为什么萍乡煤矿今年第一季度提前完成了国家规定的产煤计划，但是4月份和5月份的生产情况就比较差些呢？主要原因也是当时部分干部的工作不够踏实，生产跃进中出现的一些问题，例如机电设备经常发生故障、运输跟不上生产、掘进落后于回采等等，没有得到及时的解决；或者虽然解决了，由于解决得不彻底，问题又重新发生，以致使生产的继续跃进受到影响。以后改进了作风，领导机构搬到井下办公，领导干部深入到生产第一线，工作踏实了，机电设备的维护检修问题、运输问题、掘进问题，都在不同程度上得到解决，生产情况也有了显著的变化。请看：同一个厂、同一个矿，由于干部的作风前后不同，生产情况也大不相同。干部作风对于生产影响之大，由此可见。
    为什么干部作风对于生产有这么大的影响呢？这是因为领导生产首先必须立足于生产实际。毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一文中说：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”领导生产也是如此。只有当我们领导生产的计划、方针、措施，符合于或者大体上符合于生产实际的时候，生产才能搞好。而踏踏实实的作风，则是认识生产实际、掌握生产规律的前提。我们知道，生产的规律常常隐蔽在纷繁的表面现象的背后，不是一眼就能看透的。只有踏踏实实地深入生产实际，才能认识生产的规律，从而根据生产的规律来安排自己的工作，使主观同客观一致，把生产搞好。为什么重庆标准件厂前个时期有些新技术没有能在生产中得到运用呢？难道他们没有采取过措施吗？当然不是的。为了这件事，厂里开了几次动员大会，要求工人革新一件使用一件；但是由于当时的工作还不深入，并没有摸清这些新技术不能运用于生产的原因，因而采取的措施没有能解决问题。以后找出问题的症结，使不熟悉新技术原理的人熟悉了它的原理，使不完善的革新项目逐渐完善起来，措施符合于实际情况，因而解决了过去没有解决的问题。为什么4月份和5月份萍乡煤矿生产中的一些问题没有能够很好的解决呢？难道他们没有采取过措施吗？也不是的。只是因为作风不够踏实，对于生产中的问题“只知现象，不明原因”，也就是还“不知道那件事的规律”，因而尽管也采取了措施，这些措施并不符合生产实际，并不解决问题，或者问题解决得不彻底。反之，工作深入了，踏实了，找到了问题的症结，对症下药，一个一个的问题都得到切切实实的解决，生产就出现了新的情况。可见，生产情况的好坏，除了决定于干劲以外，也还决定于领导作风是不是深入、踏实，对生产实际是不是有了透彻的了解。深知深解，就能作出正确的判断，采取有效的措施；一知半解，往往作出错误的判断，措施必不能有效。是深知深解，还是一知半解，正是作风深入不深入、踏实不踏实的标志。
    作风对于生产的这种重大影响，是工矿企业的每一个干部都必须引起严重注意的。对于共产党员说来，工作深入不深入、踏实不踏实，还是一个党性问题。毛泽东同志在“反对党八股”的演讲中说：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。”又说：“共产党不靠吓人吃饭，而是靠马克思列宁主义的真理吃饭，靠实事求是吃饭，靠科学吃饭。”踏踏实实的作风，就是毛泽东同志所说的科学态度所需要的作风。作风飘浮而不踏实，对生产实际不甚了解，也就很难有科学态度，很难把生产搞好。
    现在，工矿企业的各级领导干部纷纷到生产第一线去，这是一件极好的事情。但是，还应该注意，到了生产第一线，并不等于就是工作深入了、踏实了。萍乡煤矿的干部过去也常常到生产第一线去，但是有些同志只是去“走一走、站一站、看一看、说一说”。这比起关在办公室里不走、不站、不看、不说，固然要好一些；但是仅仅去“走一走、站一站、看一看、说一说”，浮光掠影，仍然不可能真正地了解生产实际，掌握生产的规律。我们提倡深入生产第一线，不是形式上深入，而是真正的深入；不是满足于“走一走、站一站、看一看、说一说”，而是要在生产中生根，要在群众中落户。只有这样，到生产第一线去才是真正的深入了，才有实际的意义。
    作风问题，又是一个需要长期注意的问题，决不是“深入”了一两次，就可以一劳永逸，不再注意了的。因为生产是永远处于发展的状态中的，旧的问题解决了，新的问题又会发生；即便是一些老问题，在新的情况下，也会有新的发展。难道像萍乡煤矿所发生的掘进落后于回采、运输赶不上生产，以及机电设备常常发生故障是些什么新问题吗？不是的，这些年来，在许多煤矿，生产跃进之后，都发生过同样的问题。只是在不同的矿井、在不同的情况下，发生这些问题的具体原因也各不相同。今后萍乡煤矿是不是就不会再发生掘进落后于回采、运输跟不上生产、机电设备经常发生故障等问题呢？也未必。相反地，生产有了新的跃进以后，需要的掌子面更多了，运输量更大了，机电设备的损耗更多了，掘进、运输和设备的维护检修工作更可能落后于生产。7月份以来，萍乡煤矿的生产就又遇到采掘力量不足、设备急需检修等问题。这就需要不断地深入生产实际，掌握新的情况，及时采取具体措施解决这些问题，使生产不断地跃进。
    目前，深入生产第一线，发扬敢想敢干和踏实苦干相结合的作风，切切实实地解决一个个具体问题，已经成为一种风尚。这种新的风尚，已经对而且必将继续对我们生产事业的继续跃进发生巨大的积极作用。完全可以预见：在上半年的生产取得很大成绩以后，在技术革新和技术革命运动把成千上万的企业用新的技术武装起来以后，再加上干部的作风更加深入、更加细致、更加踏实了，一个新的生产的飞跃，就一定会在全国的工业战线上出现！
