    US-British-Dutch Monopoly Capital Controls Oil Resources
    Oil Shortages in Indonesian Oil Regions
    Oil Prices Soar Many Times　Long Queues to Buy Oil
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 30th – Eastern Kalimantan, an oil-producing region of Indonesia, is experiencing a shortage of kerosene and gasoline.
    According to an Antara News Agency correspondent in Balikpapan, although East Kalimantan is an oil-producing region, and the Batavia Petroleum Company's refinery in Balikpapan has an annual oil production of one million tons, the local people have consistently been unable to readily obtain kerosene and gasoline supplies. For the past three months or so, the citizens of Balikpapan have frequently queued to buy kerosene, and vehicles have had to wait for several hours at gas stations to get some gasoline. Residents of Birau and Tarakan have to pay two or three times the official price to buy gasoline. In Tarakan, each vehicle is only allowed to buy two liters of gasoline per day. People living inland face even greater difficulties. A bottle of kerosene, originally priced at just over one rupiah, has now risen to ten rupiah.
    Recently, there have also been shortages of gasoline and kerosene in Bandung, Jakarta, and Medan, near the oil-producing region of North Sumatra.
    Almost all of Indonesia's oil resources are monopolized by American, British, and Dutch capital. According to local newspapers, when kerosene and gasoline prices showed an upward trend last year, this country experienced shortages of these oil products. Two years ago, when Indonesian rebels launched a rebellion, some areas also experienced difficulties in oil supply.

    美英荷垄断资本控制了石油资源
    印度尼西亚油区缺油
    油价成倍上涨　买油要排长队
    新华社雅加达30日电　印度尼西亚石油产区东加里曼丹出现缺乏煤油和汽油的情况。
    据安塔拉通讯社驻巴厘巴板的记者报道，尽管东加里曼丹是一个石油产区，在巴厘巴板的一个巴达维亚石油公司的炼油厂石油年产量就达一百万吨，但是当地人民一直不能顺当地得到煤油和汽油的供应。巴厘巴板的市民在最近三个月左右，经常为买煤油而排队，同时车辆要想弄到一些汽油的供应，也必须在加油站前等候几小时。在比劳和打拉根的居民要以官价的两倍或三倍的钱才能买到汽油。在打拉根，每辆车每天只准买两公升的汽油。居住在内地的人民更为困难。每瓶原来定价为一盾多的煤油，现在上涨到十盾。
    在北苏门答腊石油产区附近的万隆、雅加达和棉兰，最近也一直缺乏汽油和煤油。
    印度尼西亚的石油资源几乎全为美国、英国和荷兰的资本所垄断。据这里的报纸指出，当去年煤油和汽油价格有上升之势的时候，在这个国家中曾出现这种油类缺货的情况。两年前，当印度尼西亚叛乱分子发动叛乱时，在某些地区也发生油类供应困难的情况。
