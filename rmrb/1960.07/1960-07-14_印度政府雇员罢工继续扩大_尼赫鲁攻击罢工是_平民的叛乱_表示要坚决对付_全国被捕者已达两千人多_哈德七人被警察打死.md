Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from New Delhi: The strike of Indian government employees continues amidst large-scale suppression by the Indian government. According to the "Statesman," as the strike entered its second day, "the pace of the strike's development in some areas was clearly accelerating, especially in West Bengal, Bombay, and Gujarat." The newspaper said that in West Bengal, the number of people responding to the strike has expanded, and refugees (who migrated from Pakistan) have also participated.

The Indian "Statesman" reported today that in the day or so since the Indian government employees' strike began at midnight on the 11th, the number of people arrested nationwide has reached two thousand.

According to the Press Trust of India, on the 12th, police in Dohad, Gujarat, fired on striking masses twice, killing a total of five people. The "Statesman" said that in this area, seven people had been killed by police by the 13th.

According to a report by the Press Trust of India on the 12th, due to the impact of the strike, passenger trains could not operate normally on some sections of the Eastern Railway and Western Railway of India. The airports in Bombay and Calcutta are relying on the Indian Air Force to help maintain operations. Railway mail in many places, such as Bombay, Calcutta, Jaipur in Rajasthan, and Nagpur in Madhya Pradesh, has encountered difficulties. In many places, counter services such as registration and remittance at post offices have been canceled. Telephone lines in many places are also being maintained by officers and "volunteers" recruited by the government.

According to news from Karachi, due to the nationwide strike in India, the Karachi telephone bureau announced on the morning of the 12th that it was unable to communicate with India.

According to Reuters, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, more than 90% of railway workers participated in the strike. The Press Trust of India reported that the attendance rate at the Jabalpur telephone factory in Madhya Pradesh was only 10%. In Naihati, twenty-three miles from Calcutta, a large number of refugees lay on the tracks to prevent trains from running.

The "Hindustan Times" reported today from Bombay that very few people were working in the three railway workshops there, and the vast majority of clerks and other low-level employees working in Bombay Customs were also absent from work. The postal department is almost completely on strike. According to a spokesman for the Maharashtra government, approximately 9% of employees in the postal, telegraph, and telephone service departments have left their jobs.

According to the "Hindustan Times," at a meeting of Congress Party members on the 11th to discuss measures to deal with the strike, Indian Prime Minister Nehru attacked the strike as a "mutiny of civilians" and said that this challenge must be dealt with resolutely and decisively. He said, "If this strike succeeds, the government will collapse."

That same evening, Interior Minister Pant, speaking to a group of Indian police reservists in New Delhi, threatened government employees preparing to strike, saying, "They should not be allowed to do so."

The Press Trust of India also reported that Finance Minister Desai, who had just returned from a month-long visit abroad to seek foreign aid, attacked the government employees' strike as "unreasonable" as soon as he stepped off the plane at the Bombay airport on the 12th.

　　印度政府雇员罢工继续扩大
　　尼赫鲁攻击罢工是“平民的叛乱”表示要坚决对付
　　全国被捕者已达两千人多　哈德七人被警察打死
    新华社13日讯　新德里消息：印度政府雇员的罢工在印度政府大规模镇压中继续进行。据“政治家报”说，当罢工进入第二天时，一些地方的罢工发展速度显而易见是在上升，特别是在西孟加拉邦，孟买和古吉拉特邦。”这家报纸说，在西孟加拉邦，响应罢工的人已经扩大，（从巴基斯坦移居来的），难民等也参加了进来。
    印度“政治家报”今天报道，自从印度政府雇员罢工从11日午夜开始以来的一天多时间内，全国被逮捕的人数已达两千人。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，12日这一天中，警察在古吉拉特邦的多哈德两次向罢工群众开枪，一共打死了五人。“政治家报”说，这个地区到13日已经有七人被警察打死。
    据印度报业托辣斯12日报道，由于受到罢工影响，印度东部铁路和西部铁路的一些地段，客车不能正常通行。孟买和加尔各答机场依靠印度空军在帮助维持。孟买、加尔各答、拉贾斯坦邦的斋浦尔和中央邦的那格浦尔等许多地方的铁路邮政发生了困难。不少地方邮局的挂号、汇款等柜台业务已经取消。许多地方的电话线路也依靠军官和由政府征集的“志愿人员”来维持。
    据来自卡拉奇的消息说，由于印度全国性的罢工，卡拉奇电话局在12日早晨宣布无法同印度通话。
    据路透社消息说，在古吉拉特邦的阿麦达巴，90％以上的铁路工人参加了罢工。印度报业托辣斯报道，中央邦查巴尔浦电话工厂的出勤率也只有10％。在离加尔各答二十三英里的奈哈提，还发生了大批难民卧轨，阻止火车行驶的事件。
      “印度斯坦时报”今天自孟买报道说，那里三个铁路工场上班的人非常稀少，绝大多数在孟买海关担任抄写工作以及其他低级雇员也都不上班，邮政部门几乎完全罢工。据马哈拉施特拉邦政府的一个发言人说，邮政、电报和电话服务部门大约已经有9％的雇员离开了他们的工作岗位。
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，在11日国大党议员讨论对付这次罢工的措施问题的会议上，印度总理尼赫鲁攻击这次罢工是“平民的叛乱”，必须坚决果断地对付这一挑战。他说，“如果这次罢工搞成，政府就垮台了”。
    同一天晚上，内政部长潘特在新德里对一批印度警察预备队员讲话时，威胁准备罢工的政府雇员说，
  “不应当允许他们这样做。”
    印度报业托辣斯还报道，为争取外援去国外访问了一个月刚回来的财政部长德赛，12日刚走下飞机，就在孟买机场上攻击政府雇员的罢工是“不合理的”。
