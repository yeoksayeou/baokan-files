Record of Seizing Mines at Red Stone Mountain
　　By Our Reporters　Feng Jian, Tang Ying

　　"Happiness Lane"

　　Before setting off for the Longyan Iron and Steel Company, we heard that there was a "Happiness Lane" in the mine, where mining was abundant, transportation was fast, and the workers' labor conditions were good. It pointed out a direction for technical transformation of underground mining. As soon as we arrived at the mine, a young deputy pit leader guided us to visit this famous underground tunnel.

　　This "Happiness Lane" was indeed well-deserved. Walking down the gently sloping steps, sufficient and fresh air brushed our faces, making us feel cool and pleasant. A long row of fluorescent lights illuminated the tunnel, so there was no need to use a flashlight. The miners worked here easily and happily, often taking the time to clean the tunnel, and rarely seeing mud, rock debris, and smoke.

　　Happiness Lane is an underground transportation hub of Yantong Mountain Mine of Longyan Iron and Steel Company. Every day, the mining teams from the five horizontal tunnels above, below, left, and right extract one thousand several hundred tons of ore, all of which must pass through here and be transported out from the ore chute. In the past, when mine cars were pushed manually, people and cars would jostle and bump, and it was easy to have accidents where people were hit or mine cars derailed. At that time, the tunnel was very dark, and the cart pushers had to shout greetings. The cart pushers worked hard all day, but still couldn't finish transporting all the extracted ore.

　　This spring, the storm of technical revolution has liberated the cart pushers from their heavy labor. Happiness Lane today presents a new scene: a line of mine cars are automatically filled with ore from the front of the chute at the mining face, and pulled by endless ropes, shuttle back and forth smoothly in the lane. They automatically go to the ore chute in Happiness Lane, automatically dump the ore, and then file back to the mining face. All of this is operated from the work station at the pit entrance, and proceeds in an orderly manner. There are only a few transport workers in the tunnel, watching over the operation of the mine cars.

　　At the end of Happiness Lane is the working face of a mining team. This mining team has a high output and is a pioneer in technical revolution, and is known as the "Spearhead Mining Team." When we entered the working face, three pneumatic drills were drilling holes, rattling. These three pneumatic drills are only watched by one worker. The drill rods of the pneumatic drills rotated rapidly, and water flowed into the rock holes along the drill rods, turning into scarlet magma. This is called wet pneumatic drilling, which eliminates the choking rock dust and flying smoke that used to occur when drilling holes. This mining team works in four shifts a day, with only eleven people. Because drilling, blasting, and mucking are all mechanized, the average daily mining efficiency per person has reached about twenty tons.

　　The deputy pit leader who guided us through the tour said that the mining teams above, below, left, and right of Happiness Lane currently produce about 1,500 tons of ore per day, which is one and a half times more than this time last year. The ore transport workers are competently doing as much as they mine, and the number of people has been reduced by two-thirds.

　　There are drinking water barrels in Happiness Lane, wrapped in cotton covers; there is a small shop, and enthusiastic salespersons deliver some daily necessities to the miners, day and night; sometimes they even deliver hot tofu brains. Along the tunnel walls, there are telephones, which can be used to report production news to the surface at any time. There are also dry rest sheds where miners can sit down and rest for a while during the intense work.

　　The "Red Star" Underground

　　The iron mines of Longyan Iron and Steel Company, including Yanran Mountain and Yantong Mountain, stretch for dozens of miles. Because the ore is red, the miners call it "Red Stone Mountain," and Happiness Lane is just a microcosm of the entire mine. Today, whether it is the underground or open-pit mining site, the transportation network, or the mechanical repair shop of Red Stone Mountain, they are all making a revolution in mining methods, a revolution in transportation tools, and a revolution in drilling technology.

　　"Thousands of blast furnaces are waiting for ore. How should we make full use of underground space and time?" This is a question that thousands of miners often ponder.

　　At the working face of the "Red Star" Mining Team, we saw the heroic spirit of the miners conquering the ore seam with wisdom:

　　A mining face dozens of meters long has been opened up by the miners into two steps. One step had just been blasted, and the collapsed scarlet iron ore, wet, gleamed under the lights. The gunpowder smoke had dissipated, and the mucking workers were rattlingly transporting the ore downwards. At the same time, the working face of the other step had long been cleaned up, the pillars were neatly arranged, and four pneumatic drills were advancing towards the ore seam again, rattling.

　　This is a new mining method. Captain Niu Dongji told us that the biggest advantage of this method is that it can be done in parallel, drilling, blasting, mucking, and supporting pillars, several jobs can be done together, and the miners can show their skills. In the past, on the working face, drilling would hinder mucking, or mucking would hinder drilling. This kind of trouble has long left their side.

　　The team members' "competition" is in full swing. Team against team, person against person, one is better than the other. The following is a story that happened in one day and night:

　　On the night shift of July 5th, "Sharpshooter" (this is the nickname given by the miners to drilling experts) Zhao Bin, drilled twenty-three holes with a pneumatic drill, thirty-seven meters deep, creating a new record. The mining face of the "Red Star" team is more than thirty degrees inclined, only one person high up and down, and the lights are not very bright. It is difficult for ordinary people to stand empty-handed, but the drilling worker held a pneumatic drill weighing more than eighty pounds that jumped non-stop, and created such a high drilling record, which is indeed rare. Therefore, the news spread like wildfire underground.

　　The next morning, it was "Sharpshooter" Yang Shifu's turn to work. As soon as he and his four partners arrived at the working face, they set up the air pipes and water pipes, and immediately opened the air valve, so that the drill bits of the four pneumatic drills pierced into the hard ore seam at the same time. This shift, they created a new record of one hundred and eighteen meters drilled by four pneumatic drills.

　　Two shifts of continuous high yield inspired another "Sharpshooter" Yang Mingfu. Team leader Hu Yamin told him the new records of the previous two shifts at the pre-shift meeting. He admired Zhao Bin and Yang Shifu very much in his heart, and also secretly made up his mind: "Must surpass them." In this shift, Yang Mingfu and his assistant drilled twenty-six holes with a pneumatic drill, forty-nine meters deep, surpassing Zhao Bin and Yang Shifu.

　　The team members did not disappoint the glorious name of "Red Star." In the past year, among the dozens of mining teams in the mine, its output has been the highest, and the "Red Star" team has become a real "Red Star" shining in the Red Stone Mountain underground.

　　Mine Car Revolution

　　In the spider web-like transportation tunnels of Red Stone Mountain underground, dozens of local electric cars come and go, like shuttles. It runs very smoothly, can be fast or slow, pulling five or six mine cars, or even more than a dozen. The ore transport efficiency of this local electric car is more than double that of manual cart pushing, saving both manpower and safety. A ballad is circulating underground: Mine car, mine car, listen to me: "Yesterday I pushed you, today you carry me!"

　　Only cart pushers can truly understand the great significance of this mine car revolution from manual cart pushing to local electric cars. When pushing carts manually, the cart pushers worked a shift, which was equivalent to pushing a heavy car of one and a half tons and running dozens of miles underground. The work was very intense, and production could not move forward by leaps and bounds. - At that time, underground transportation was backward, like a stone blocking the road to the Great Leap Forward.

　　This matter deeply touched electrician Liang Rong. He thought: "To increase ore production, we must overcome this hurdle."

　　Once, he saw a winch pulling a mine car, and a thought flashed in his mind: "Put the winch on a car frame and install wheels, wouldn't it be able to pull the mine car?" He decided to try to make a local electric car for underground ore transport.

　　With the encouragement and help of the Party, Liang Rong and technicians and veteran workers together conducted more than one hundred experiments, spending countless efforts.

　　Take the trolley pole of the local electric car as an example. In order to maintain good contact between the trolley pole and the wire, Liang Rong and others modified it more than ten times, spending a whole month. In those days, Liang Rong and other electricians, as soon as they got off work during the day, ran down the tunnel, sat on the swaying local electric car, and observed the operation of the trolley pole. The trolley pole swayed, sometimes left and sometimes right, touching the wire and making a slight cracking sound. The flashing sparks stung the electricians' eyes, so they put on dark glasses and continued to observe. If they found a problem, they would improve it in time…

　　The "stone" on the road to advancement was finally removed. Since this spring, local electric cars have been widely installed inside and outside the pit, greatly improving transportation efficiency and ensuring that ore production rises step by step.

　　The Red Banner of Tunneling

　　The sound of the rock drilling pneumatic drill stopped. A moment later, a rumbling blasting sound came from the depths of the tunnel. Then, the rock drilling machine busied itself, clangingly filling the muck with skip cars and dumping it into the valley outside the tunnel. - This is the construction site of the nationally renowned "Underground Vanguard" Ma Wanshui rapid tunneling team. They are opening up a transportation tunnel for the mine to open up a new mining face.

　　The Ma Wanshui team is a red banner of mine tunneling. Ten years ago, they created the first national new record here, and became famous throughout the country with a speed of 21.3 meters per month. By May of this year, they had created twelve national new records, and the monthly tunneling reached 628.2 meters. Today, they are moving towards higher goals.

　　People familiar with the mine know that tunneling hundreds of meters of tunnels in a month is not an easy task. The tunneling workers must thoroughly understand the secrets of the formation, use the most tenacious will to conquer the torrential underground water, conquer the quicksand that flows straight down, and conquer hard, soft, and all kinds of rocks.

　　Once, the Ma Wanshui team encountered quartz stone, known as the "King of Hard Rock." Its hardness is twenty-two levels, and as soon as it touches the pneumatic drill, it sparks and makes a loud metallic sound. The best alloy steel drill bit dulls in just a few minutes. Team leader Guo Jincai, who is good at identifying various rocks, immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" on the spot. They thought of a way to first drill holes and blast in the lower part of the rock, and after the lower part was hollowed out, then drill holes and blast in the upper part. As a result, the blasting efficiency was greatly improved, and the "King of Rock" was subdued.

　　The miners said it well: "Politics plus technology, rock turns into tofu!"

    红石山夺矿记
    本报记者　冯健　唐荧
    “幸福巷”
    动身去龙烟钢铁公司以前，就听说那里的矿山有一个“幸福巷”，矿采得多，运得快，工人劳动条件好，为坑下开采的矿山指明了一个技术改造的方向。刚到矿山，我们由一位年青的副坑长引导，参观了这个有名的坑下巷道。
    这“幸福巷”果然名不虚传。沿着缓缓倾斜的阶梯下行，充足、清新的空气拂面而来，使人感到凉爽宜人。一长列日光灯，把巷道照亮了，走路不需打手电筒。矿工们在这里劳动轻松愉快，时常抽点时间把巷道打扫得干干净净，很少看到泥水、石碴和烟尘。
    幸福巷是龙烟钢铁公司烟筒山矿的一个坑下运输咽喉。上下左右五个平巷的采矿队，每天采出一千几百吨矿，都要经过这里，从溜矿井运出去。过去用人力推矿车，人来车往，挤挤撞撞，很容易发生撞人或矿车掉道事故。那时候，巷道里很暗，推车工要?喝着打招呼。推车工劳累一天，采出的矿石还运不完。
    今年春天，技术革命的风暴，把推车工从繁重的劳动中解放出来了。幸福巷里今天呈现出另一番崭新的景象：一列列矿车，从采矿工作面的溜子前面自动装满矿石，由无极绳牵引着，穿梭般地在巷内平稳行驶。它们自动走到幸福巷的溜矿井，自动把矿石倒出去，然后又鱼贯地走回采矿工作面去。所有这一切，都由坑口的工作台操纵着，进行得井然有序。巷道里只有少数几个运输工，照看着矿车运行。
    幸福巷的尾部，是一个采矿队的工作面。这个采矿队的产量高，又是技术革命的先驱，被称为“尖兵采矿队”。我们走进工作面时，三部风钻正在打眼，哒哒地响着。这三部风钻只由一个工人看管。风钻的钎杆飞快地旋转着，水顺着钎杆流进岩孔，变成赤色的岩浆淌了出来。这叫水湿风钻打眼，它消灭了往常打眼时呛人的岩粉和飞扬的烟尘。这个采矿队每天分四班作业，只有十一个人。因为打眼、爆破、扒矿都实现了机械化，每人每天的采矿工效平均达到了二十吨左右。
    引导我们参观的副坑长谈，目前幸福巷上下左右的采矿队，每天生产矿石一千五百吨左右，比去年这时候猛增一倍半。运矿工人们胜任愉快地做到了采多少，运多少，而且人数减少了三分之二。
    幸福巷里有饮水桶，还用棉套子裹着；有小卖部，热情的售货员，不分昼夜把一些日用物品送到矿工手里；有时还送来热腾腾的豆腐脑儿。沿着巷壁，装有电话，可以随时向地面上报告生产喜讯。还有干燥的休息棚，矿工们能在紧张劳动的空隙坐下来憩息片刻。
    坑下的“红星”
    龙烟钢铁公司的铁矿山，包括燕然山和烟筒山，连绵几十里长。因为矿石是红色的，矿工们都叫它“红石山”，这幸福巷只不过是整个矿山的一个缩影。今天，无论是红石山坑下的或露天的采矿场、运输网路和机械修理车间，都在大闹采矿方法的革命，运输工具的革命，凿岩技术的革命。
    “千百座高炉等着矿石哩。我们应该怎样充分利用坑下的空间和时间？”这是千百名采矿工人经常深思的一个问题。
    在“红星”采矿队的工作面，我们看到了采矿工人用智慧征服矿层的英雄气概：
    一个几十米长的采矿面，被矿工们开辟成了两个阶梯。一个阶梯刚放过炮，崩下来的赤色铁矿石，湿漉漉的，在电灯下闪着亮光。火药的硝烟已经散了，扒运工人正在哗啦啦地往下运矿。就在同时，另一个阶梯的工作面早已收拾得干干净净，支柱整齐地排列着，四部风钻又哒哒哒地向矿层进军了。
    这是一种新的采矿方法。队长牛东计告诉我们，这种方法最大的好处，就是能够平行作业，打眼、爆破、扒矿、支柱，几种活一起干，矿工们能大显身手。往日工作面上，不是打眼妨碍扒矿，就是扒矿妨碍打眼，这种苦恼，早已离开了他们的身边。
    队员们的“较劲赛”搞得热火朝天。班与班，人与人，真是一个赛过一个。下面是发生在一昼夜内的故事：
    7月5日夜班，“神枪手”（这是矿工们给打眼能手起的绰号）赵斌，用一台风钻打眼二十三个，深三十七米，创造了一个新纪录。那“红星”队的采矿工作面，有三十多度倾斜，上下不过一人来高，电灯又不算亮，普通人空手站着还很吃力呢，打眼工握着八十多斤重暴跳不息的风钻，创造了这样高的凿岩纪录确实难得。于是，消息风也似地在坑下传开了。
    次日清晨，轮到“神枪手”杨士富上班。他和四个伙伴一到工作面，摆好风管水管，就立即打开风门，使四台风钻的钎头，一齐刺进了坚硬的矿层。这一班，他们创造了四台风钻打眼一百一十八米的新纪录。
    两个班连续高产，激励了另一个“神枪手”杨明富。班长胡雅民在班前会上，把前两班的新纪录告诉了他。他心里很佩服赵斌和杨士富，一边也暗暗下了决心：“一定要超过他们。”就在这一班，杨明富同他的助手，用一台风钻打眼二十六个，深四十九米，赛过了赵斌和杨士富。
    队员们没有辜负“红星”这个光荣的名字。一年来，矿山几十个采矿队当中，数它的产量最高，“红星”队成了闪耀在红石山坑下一颗真正的“红星”。
    矿车革命
    红石山坑下蜘蛛网般的运输巷道里，几十部土电车来来往往，像穿梭似的。它跑得很稳，可快可慢，少则拉五、六部矿车，多则拉十几部。这种土电车的运矿效率，比人力推车提高一倍以上，又省人力又安全。坑下流传着一首歌谣：矿车、矿车，你听我说：“昨天我推你，今天你驮我！”
    只有推车工，才能真正理解从人力推车到土电车这场矿车革命的伟大意义。用人力推车的时候，推车工干一个班，等于推着一吨半的重车在坑下跑几十里路，工作很紧张，生产还不能大踏步前进。——那时候，坑下运输落后，像块石头一样横在跃进的路上。
    这件事深深触动了电工梁溶。他想：“要增产矿石，一定要攻克这一关。”
    一次，他看到卷扬机拉矿车，脑子里蓦地闪出一个念头：“把卷扬机放在一个车架上，安上轱辘，这不就能拉着矿车跑吗？”他决心试制一种坑下运矿的土电车。
    在党的鼓励和帮助下，梁溶和技术员、老工人一起，前后进行了一百多次试验，花费了无数的心血。
    拿土电车的弓子来说吧。为了使弓子和电线保持良好的接触，梁溶他们修改了十几次，花了整整一个多月工夫。在那些日子里，梁溶同别的电工一起，白天一下班，就跑下巷道，坐上晃晃荡荡的土电车，观察弓子运行的情况。那弓子摇摇摆摆，忽左忽右，碰上电线，发出刺刺的微响。闪亮的火花刺痛了电工们的眼珠，他们就戴上墨色眼镜继续观察。发现了问题，就及时改进……
    前进道路上的“石头”终于被搬走了。从今年春天以来，坑内坑外普遍装上了土电车，大大提高了运输效率，保证了矿石产量步步高升。
    掘进的红旗
    凿岩风钻的响声停下来了。过一刻，巷道深处传来了隆隆的爆破声。接着，凿岩机忙碌起来，铿锵作响地把岩碴装满斗车，倾泄到巷外的山谷中。——这是闻名全国的“地下尖兵”马万水快速掘进组的工地。他们正在为矿山开辟新采矿工作面打通运输巷道。
    马万水小组是矿山掘进的一面红旗。十年前，他们在这里创造了第一个全国新纪录，以月掘进二十一点三米的速度闻名全国。到今年5月，他们已经创造了十二次全国新纪录，月掘进达到了六百二十八点二米。今天，他们正在向更高的目标前进。
    熟悉矿山的人知道，一个月掘进巷道几百米，不是一件容易的事。掘进工人们必须摸透地层的秘密，用最顽强的意志去征服倾盆大雨般的地下水，征服松得刷刷直淌的流砂，征服硬的、软的，各种各样的岩石。
    有一次，马万水小组碰到了被称为“硬岩石之王”的石英石。它的硬度有二十二级，一触风钻，就火星四射，发出当当的金属响声。最好的合金钢钎头，只几分钟就磨钝了。善于识别各种岩石的组长郭进才，立刻在现场召开了“诸葛亮会”。他们想办法先在岩石的下部打眼、放炮，下部掏空了，再在上部打眼、放炮。结果，爆破效率提高得很快，“岩石之王”被制服了。
    矿工们说得好：“政治加技术，岩石变豆腐”！
