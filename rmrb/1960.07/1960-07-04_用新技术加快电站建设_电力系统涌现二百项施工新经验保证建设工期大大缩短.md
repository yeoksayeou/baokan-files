New Technologies Accelerate Power Plant Construction
Power System Sees Over Two Hundred New Construction Experiences Guaranteeing Greatly Shortened Construction Time

(Our dispatch) In the national power industry's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a large number of advanced construction experiences have emerged. These experiences have been summarized into more than two hundred new technologies and experiences of great significance, and are being fully promoted in all capital construction units.

These more than two hundred advanced experiences include hydropower, thermal power, and power transmission and transformation. After they are all promoted, they will bring about major changes in the construction of China's entire power industry. The construction and commissioning period for most new thermal power plants will be greatly shortened; the construction period for 110 kV and above high-voltage transmission and transformation projects will also be shorter than at present.

After the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, China's power industry greatly accelerated its speed in design, construction, equipment installation, and transmission line erection compared with the First Five-Year Plan period. However, there were also some weak links that affected the further shortening of the overall construction period. Therefore, the advanced experiences summarized and required to be promoted by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power this time are primarily aimed at solving these weak links. For example, the construction method of "conquering six barriers" (hoisting and transporting, assembling, welding, furnace wall insulation, auxiliary equipment, and pipelines) for boiler installation, which was specially summarized at the on-site construction meeting of thermal power plants held in Huainan City, Anhui Province, can greatly shorten the construction period of large boilers.

In hydropower construction, important experiences being promoted in various places include the method of building dams by filling earth in water, high-block pouring of large-volume concrete dams, the method of building dams by directional blasting, the use of hydraulic mining of earth materials, and complete sets of sand mining machinery, leveling machines, and other mechanized and automated construction machinery. These construction methods and machinery can effectively solve the key problems in the construction of hydropower station dams.

In order to reduce construction costs as much as possible and build the most power stations and transmission lines with the least amount of materials, various places are also focusing on promoting new technologies and experiences such as the widespread use of reinforced concrete structures and prestressed reinforced concrete structures in various projects, and the use of asbestos-cement pipes to replace low-pressure steam steel pipes. According to calculations, as long as these advanced experiences are widely promoted in new and expanded projects with the necessary conditions this year, the consumption of both cement and steel will be greatly reduced compared with 1959.

In addition, the experiences being promoted in national hydropower and thermal power projects also include how to achieve simple and rapid power transmission in cases where complete sets of equipment are not available, adopting local materials as much as possible to build cofferdams, dams and factory buildings, and accelerating the progress of design and geological exploration. All of these will play an important role in ensuring the completion of this year's grand construction plan. (Attached picture)

    用新技术加快电站建设
    电力系统涌现二百项施工新经验保证建设工期大大缩短
    本报讯　全国电力工业在技术革新和技术革命运动中，涌现出大量的先进施工经验。这些经验已经总结成了二百多条具有重大意义的新技术和新经验，并且正在所有基本建设单位全面推广。
    这二百多项先进经验包括水电、火电和送变电三个方面。它们全部推广以后，将使我国整个电力工业的建设发生重大变化。其中新建火力发电站大部分施工和投入生产的期限将大为缩短；十一万伏以上的高压送变电工程的施工期也将比现在缩短。
    我国电力工业经过1958年和1959年两年大跃进，不论在设计、施工、安装设备和架设输电线路等方面，速度都比第一个五年计划期间大大加快，但是也存在着一些薄弱环节，影响了整个工期的进一步缩短。因此，这次水利电力部总结并要求推广的先进经验，首先为了解决这些薄弱环节。例如，不久前在安徽淮南市召开的火力发电站施工现场会议上专门总结的机炉安装“攻六关”（吊运、组装、焊接、炉墙保温、附属、管道）的施工方法，就可以使大型锅炉的施工期大为缩短。
    在水电建设中，各地正在推广的重要经验有水中填土筑坝法、大体积混凝土坝高块浇筑、定向爆破筑坝法、用水力开采土料，以及成套的采砂机械、平仓机等各种机械化、自动化的施工机具。这些施工方法和机具都可以有效地解决修筑水电站大坝中的各项关键问题。
    为了尽可能降低建筑成本，用最少的材料建设最多的电站和送变电线路，各地还正在着重推广各类工程中广泛采用钢筋混凝土结构、预应力钢筋混凝土结构，用石棉水泥管代替低压蒸气钢管等方面的新技术和新经验。据计算，这些先进经验今年只要在有条件的新建和扩建工程中普遍推广，不论水泥和钢材的消耗量都将比1959年大大节省。
    除此以外，全国水电、火电工程中正在推广的经验中还包括了在配套设备不能到全的情况下如何做到简易快速的发送电，尽可能采用当地材料建筑围堰大坝厂房，以及加快设计、地质勘探进度等方面的技术革新成果。所有这些，都对保证完成今年宏伟的建设计划将起重要作用。（附图片）
