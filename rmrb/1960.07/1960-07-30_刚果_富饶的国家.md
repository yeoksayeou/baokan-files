Congo—A Rich Country
	Liu Feng

	Congo is one of the few rich countries in the world. Its territory is nearly a quarter of the size of our country. The equator crosses it, and the hot temperature and abundant rainfall make the plants here particularly lush. The country has over 100 million hectares of tropical jungle, and fertile land prepares good harvests for hardworking people. This is the home of the rubber tree. Coffee, sugarcane, and tobacco are all suitable for growth, not to mention food and cotton. However, under colonial rule, agriculture has not developed. Only palm oil occupies an important position in the world market. Therefore, although the natural conditions are very good, the people are starving. The evil consequences of cruel colonialism have led even a former Belgian colonial governor to admit that the population of the Congo is rapidly decreasing. Since the end of the 19th century, it is estimated to have decreased by more than half!

	What colonialism cared about was mainly plundering Congo's underground wealth. Mineral products account for about two-thirds of Congo's total exports. Congo's diamond production accounts for more than 60% of the world's production; the production of copper and tin ranks fourth in the capitalist world. The copper content of copper ore is rarely so high. In the United States, ore containing 5% copper is already considered a treasure, while Congo's copper ore can reach 8%, especially since it also contains rare metals such as cobalt, germanium, and cadmium. The vast majority of cobalt in the capitalist world is produced by the Congo. Tin ore also contains rare metals, mainly niobium and tantalum.

	Congo's tungsten and manganese deposits are also very rich. More importantly, uranium ore was initially mined to obtain radium. After the secret of atomic energy was revealed and uranium became the main raw material for atomic energy, uranium became extremely important. The output of Congo's uranium ore increased fourteenfold between 1940 and 1950. For a considerable period, it ranked first in uranium production in the capitalist world, and it is still among the top today.

	Of the country's utilized hydropower resources, Katanga Province accounts for more than 80%. Congo's hydropower resources are extremely abundant. The huge Congo River has one of the largest water volumes in the world, and the riverbed has great variations in height, resulting in strong hydropower.

	Congo's resources have not brought happiness to the people. The colonialists plundered these riches, leaving behind 80% illiteracy and a 50% infant mortality rate (see "The Traveler," 1959, Issue 2); there are only a few hundred doctors among more than twelve million people...

	How can the Congolese people endure this situation! They use heroic struggles to expel imperialism and want to be the masters of their own land. Today, in the situation where the east wind prevails over the west wind, the resolute struggle of the awakened Congolese people will surely shatter the conspiracies of imperialism and colonialism, achieve true independence, and be the masters of their own wealth.

    刚果——富饶的国家
    柳风
    刚果，世界上少有的富饶的国家，她的领土面积将近我国的四分之一，赤道横贯其中，炎热的气温和充沛的雨量使得这里的植物特别繁茂，全国有一亿公顷以上的热带丛林，肥沃的土地为勤劳的人们准备着好收成。这里是橡胶树的老家，咖啡、甘蔗、烟草都适于生长，粮食、棉花更不用说。但在殖民主义的统治下，农业没有发展起来，只有棕榈油在世界市场上占着重要的地位，因此虽然自然条件很好，人民却在饥饿之中。在残酷的殖民主义统治下所产生的恶果，连一个前比利时殖民总督也不得不承认刚果的人口在迅速减少着，十九世纪末叶以来，据估计已减少了一半多！
    殖民主义所关心的主要是掠夺刚果的地下财富。矿产品占刚果出口总额的三分之二左右。刚果的钻石产量占世界产量的60％以上；铜和锡的产量都在资本主义世界中占第四位。铜矿石含铜量之多更是少有的，在美国，矿石中含铜5％的已是珍品了，而刚果的铜矿石含铜量可达到8％，特别是还含有钴、锗、镉等稀有金属，资本主义世界中绝大部分的钴是由刚果生产的。在锡矿中也含有稀有金属，主要是铌和钽。
    刚果的钨、锰等矿藏也是很丰富的，更为重要的是铀矿，最初开采它是为了取得镭，在原子能的秘密揭开、铀成为主要的原子能原料以后，铀变得异常重要了。刚果铀矿石的输出量在1940—1950年间提高了十四倍，相当长的时间内居于资本主义世界铀矿生产的首位，现在也还仍然是在前列。
    在全国已利用的水力资源中，加丹加省占有了80％以上。刚果的水力资源是极其丰富的。巨大的刚果河水量之多，在世界上名列前茅，而且河床地势高低变化很大，水力强烈。
    刚果富源并没有给人民带来幸福，殖民主义者掠夺了这些财富，留下的是80％的文盲，50％的婴儿死亡率（见《旅行家》1959年第二期）；在一千二百多万人中只有几百个医生……。
    刚果人民怎能忍受这种状况呢！他们用英勇的斗争驱逐帝国主义，要作自己土地的主人。今天在东风压倒西风的形势下，觉醒了的刚果人民的坚决斗争一定会粉碎帝国主义和殖民主义的阴谋，得到真正的独立，作自己财富的主人。
