    Hebei
    According to Xinhua News Agency Tianjin dispatch: While vigorously grasping diversified operations to increase harvests, Hebei Province is concentrating superior forces, using high-yield plots as a base, to vigorously cultivate high-yield fields, guaranteeing total output with high yields, and vowing to seize an all-round agricultural bumper harvest.

    Hebei Province encountered an extraordinary drought this year. However, the heroic people of Hebei Province, under the leadership of the Party, waged a tenacious battle against the drought and achieved great victories. At present, one-third of the province's cultivated land has been built into high-yield plots for various crops, most of which have reached the standard of garden-like fields with both wells and canals for irrigation. However, because the vast majority of this year's field crops were sown under extreme drought conditions, the sowing dates of many crops varied, and the emergence of seedlings was uneven; some crops have undergone multiple replanting and transplanting, and the growth of early and late seedlings, strong and weak seedlings, also varies greatly. After studying these circumstances, the Provincial Party Committee believes that in order to win a bumper autumn harvest, in addition to strengthening crop management and striving for overall increased production, it is necessary to use high-yield plots as a base, vigorously cultivate high-yield fields, and increase yield per unit area, to guarantee total output with high yields. At present, Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the Provincial Party Committee's instructions to seize a bumper autumn harvest, have used high-yield plots as a base to determine the area of high-yield fields. Shijiazhuang, Handan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan and other five cities have determined 31.7 million mu of high-yield fields.

    In the high-yield and high-quota competition, Tianjin City, led by secretaries at all levels, has more than 20,000 leading cadres at all levels entering high-yield plots and high-yield fields to participate in and lead production. The Handan area, from the city to the county, commune, and production team, is led by 10,000 secretaries at all levels, and has transferred more than one million strong laborers to form professional teams to set up camp in high-quota and high-yield fields and launch a blitz competition.

    In order to ensure comprehensive high yields in high-yield fields, all localities generally adopt the method of combining leaders, technicians, and experienced farmers, and promote crop upgrades by summarizing management experience, so that field management reaches high quality and high standards. In Handan, Shijiazhuang and other places, in order to ensure that high-yield cotton plants produce many pre-autumn bolls, many counties held on-site meetings on cotton management, using high-yield plots and experimental fields as bases. At the three-way combination experience exchange meeting in Nangong County, the characteristics of this year's cotton growth under drought conditions, such as large root systems, small branches and leaves, uneven strength of cotton seedlings, hot weather in the dog days, high temperatures, and the possibility of pre-autumn boll shedding due to improper management, were studied, and comprehensive management measures were formulated to manage different cotton seedlings differently, and integrate water, fertilizer, and preservation. This ensured the normal growth of cotton seedlings. In order to ensure high yields for every cotton plant in the high-yield fields, the Cheng'an Commune of Ci County adopted a set of scientific management methods based on this year's cotton seedling growth, such as applying coarse fertilizer finely, applying fine fertilizer precisely, applying fertilizer centrally, applying fertilizer mixed, applying fertilizer in ditches, applying fertilizer in holes, applying liquid fertilizer, applying fertilizer deeply by piercing holes, and watering with small amounts frequently and finely. This enabled the cotton seedlings in the high-yield fields to achieve deep roots and lush foliage, and every cotton plant increased bolls and buds.

    Sichuan
    According to Xinhua News Agency Chengdu dispatch: Sichuan Province is concentrating its main labor force and launching a mid-season rice field management campaign centered on topdressing.

    Mid-season rice is Sichuan Province's main autumn harvest crop. In the previous period, some areas experienced drought, and the broad masses tried every possible means to fight drought and rush transplanting. Insufficient base fertilizer was applied to some paddy fields, and water volume was insufficient, so it is necessary to strengthen management more carefully, apply topdressing fertilizer early, and apply more topdressing fertilizer. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels, immediately after mid-season rice transplanting, immediately made proper arrangements for labor and quickly launched a field management campaign centered on accumulating and making fertilizer.

    All localities carry out meticulous management according to the different growth conditions of rice, and apply topdressing fertilizer reasonably according to local conditions. Guang'an County, after classifying fields one by one, found that the rice seedlings in some hardpan fields, nursery fields, and cold soaking fields were not growing well, and immediately took different measures. In just three days, it pressed green manure, spread lime, and weeded seedlings in 50,000 mu of paddy fields. Due to the appropriate topdressing fertilizer and timely irrigation in various places, the proportion of third-class seedlings in the province's mid-season rice has rapidly decreased from 14% in the previous period to about 7%.

    All localities have established professional field management teams, established and improved the responsibility system, and promoted field management work to be both vigorous and down-to-earth. Pixian County adopted the method of dividing fields, assigning plots, numbering fields for each group, assigning dedicated management, and contracting to the end, which greatly improved the quality of management. Mid-season rice in the county has generally been topdressed and weeded once, and more than half has been topdressed and weeded twice. Many areas have also widely carried out field management competitions and chain competitions for rice, regularly checking and comparing, inserting red flags extensively, and establishing models, which effectively promoted mid-season rice field management work.

    Guangxi
    According to Xinhua News Agency Nanning dispatch: All parts of Guangxi are concentrating leadership and labor, and doubling their efforts to strengthen mid-season rice field management, striving for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice.

    In Guilin Prefecture, which has a large planting area of mid-season rice, more than 100 rural people's communes have moved their offices to production teams to strengthen leadership on the front lines of production. In order to make up for the losses caused by drought in the previous season, Party committees at all levels in Baise Prefecture have designated a secretary to be in charge of mid-season rice care work. The entire prefecture has concentrated more than 130,000 laborers and formed 10,200 professional teams to carry out a high-yield movement of one mu of mid-season rice being equivalent to two mu. Nandan, Damiaoshan, Huanjiang and other counties (autonomous counties) in Liuzhou Prefecture, which have a large amount of mid-season rice, are also stepping up cultivation and topdressing to carry out an overproduction movement.

    After cadres went deep into the front lines, they solved some specific problems in a down-to-earth manner, greatly improving the quality and level of field management. Cadres at the four levels of Huanjiang County joined forces in the fields and, together with the commune members, classified the rice seedlings and implemented the four-look topdressing method of looking at the soil quality, looking at the rice seedlings, looking at the base fertilizer, and looking at the varieties. The 430 mu of mid-season rice in Tangba Brigade of Zhongnan Commune, after classification, included 150 mu of sandy soil fields, with an average of 10 dan of green manure applied per mu; 250 mu of clay soil fields, with an average of 20 dan of cattle manure applied per mu; and 30 mu of semi-clay and semi-sandy soil fields, with an average of 8 to 10 dan of human and animal manure applied per mu. For japonica and glutinous rice varieties, more ammonium sulfate and other fertilizers were applied; for indica rice varieties, more bone meal and superphosphate were applied. After the four-look topdressing, the rice seedlings in the entire team generally grew vigorously, and 85 mu of third-class seedlings also caught up with the first class.

    In order to comprehensively improve the yield per unit area of mid-season rice, all localities have focused on eliminating third-class seedlings in field management.

    Inner Mongolia
    According to Xinhua News Agency Hohhot dispatch: In the current critical season for agricultural production, six leagues and cities in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including Ulanqab, Zhaowuda, and Baotou, have transferred 80% of their rural labor force to strengthen autumn field management.

    In Hulunbuir, Jirem, and Zhaowuda leagues, and in thirty-three banners, counties and cities located in the southern foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the West Liao River Basin, one million strong men and women laborers have been concentrated to form a field management shock force to carry out weeding, topdressing, pest control, and flood prevention. The autumn field crops in these areas have all been weeded once, and they are rushing to weed them a second and third time. Damaged land which suffered from wind, hail, insects and other disasters were promptly rescued and replanted, and the seedling conditions are gradually improving. The Chinese Communist Party's Buteha Banner Committee has arranged work centering on agriculture, transferring 80% of the Banner Committee members to go deep into the commune production teams to take charge of specific areas, strengthen leadership on the front lines of production, and transfer more than 2,000 cadres, workers, teachers and students from various agencies, institutions, and schools throughout the banner to go to the backward teams to settle down and help with work. At present, the 760,000 mu of major autumn crops in the entire banner have completed the third plowing and hoeing, and most of the millet has been weeded twice and thinned twice. As the level of field management improves step by step, the seedlings are growing lush and green. In the Ulanqab League and the 15 banners, counties and cities of Helingeer, Fengzhen, etc., in the western part of the autonomous region, where the drought is more serious, more than 85% of the rural labor force and a large number of government cadres, workers, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers have been mobilized since the beginning of July to fight drought and protect seedlings. They adopted measures such as storing, diverting, digging, intercepting, and lifting water, greatly expanding water sources, and expanding the irrigated area, and finally irrigated more than 1.5 million mu of drought-stricken crops, and the summer irrigation area increased by two times compared with the end of June.

    Since Inner Mongolia has concentrated its main force to strengthen the agricultural production front, the autumn crop field management work in the entire region has greatly changed. The area of the second weeding has accounted for 78.7% of the area that should be weeded, an increase of 25.1% over the same period last year, and the area of topdressing has also expanded by more than one time compared with the same period last year.

    河北
    据新华社天津电　河北省在大抓多种多收的同时，集中优势力量，以丰产方为基地，大力培育高产田，以高产保总产，誓夺农业全面丰收。
    河北省今年遇到特大干旱。但英勇的河北省人民在党的领导下，与干旱展开顽强的战斗，并取得了很大胜利。现在全省三分之一的耕地建成了各种作物丰产方，其中大部已经达到井渠双保险的园田化标准。但因今年的大田作物，绝大多数是在极端干旱情况下播种的，许多作物播种期早晚不一，出苗高低不齐；有些作物经过多次补苗移苗，早苗晚苗、强苗弱苗的生长情况，也有很大差异。省委在研究了这些情况后，认为要夺取秋季大丰收，除加强农作物管理，力争全面增产外，必须以丰产方为基地，大力培育高产田，提高单位面积产量，以高产保总产。目前各级党委都根据省委夺取秋季大丰收的指示，以丰产方为基地，确定了高产田的面积。石家庄、邯郸、保定、张家口、唐山等五市，就确定了三千一百七十万亩高产田。
    在大面积高额丰产竞赛中，天津市在各级书记带领下，已有两万多名各级领导干部，进入丰产方高产田，参加生产领导生产。邯郸地区从市到县、社、生产队由一万名各级书记挂帅，抽调了一百多万精壮劳力，组成专业队到高额丰产田安营扎寨，并展开了突击竞赛。
    为了保证高产田全面高产，各地普遍采取领导、技术员、老农三结合的办法，通过总结管理经验，促进作物升级，使田间管理达到高质量高标准。邯郸、石家庄等地为使高产田棉花棵棵多座伏前桃，不少县以丰产方、试验田为基地，召开了棉花管理现场会议。南宫县在三结合经验交流会上，研究了今年的棉花在干旱情况下生长根系大、枝叶小、棉苗弱强不一和伏天炎热、气温高、管理不当会引起伏桃脱落等特点，制定了不同棉苗不同管，水肥保管一齐上的综合管理措施。保证了棉苗的正常生长。磁县成安公社为了保证高产田棵棵棉花保高产。根据今年棉苗生长情况，采取了粗肥细施、细肥精施、集中施、混施、沟施、穴施、液施、扎孔深施和小水勤浇、细水长流等一套科学管理方法，使高产田棉苗达到根深叶茂，株株棉花增铃增蕾。
    四川
    据新华社成都电　四川省集中主要劳力，掀起以追肥为中心的中稻田间管理运动。
    中稻是四川省的主要秋收作物。前段时期，部分地区发生干旱，广大群众千方百计抗旱抢栽，部分稻田底肥施得不足，水量欠缺，因此需要更精细地加强管理，早追肥，多追肥。各级党委针对这一情况，紧接中稻栽插以后，立即妥善安排劳力，迅速开展了以积肥造肥为中心的田间管理运动。
    各地都根据水稻生长的不同情况，因田制宜进行精细管理，合理追肥。广安县经过逐块排队，发现有部分夹板田、秧母田、冷浸田的稻苗生长不好，即分别采取不同措施，仅三天就给五万亩稻田压了青，撒了石灰，薅了秧。由于各地追肥适度、灌水及时，全省中稻三类苗由前段时期的14％迅速下降为7％左右。
    各地建立田间管理专业队伍，建立和健全责任制度，促使田间管理工作既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。郫县采取划田定块、组田对号、专管理、包干到底的办法，使管理质量大大提高。全县中稻已普遍追肥薅秧一次，一半以上已追肥薅秧二次。不少地区还广泛开展了水稻田间管理的对手赛、连环赛，定期检查评比，大插红旗，广树标兵，有力地促进了中稻田间管理工作。
    广西
    据新华社南宁电　广西各地集中领导，集中劳力，用双倍的力气加强中稻田间管理，力争中稻丰收。
    中稻种植面积较多的桂林专区，一百多个农村人民公社已把办公室搬到生产队，加强生产第一线的领导。百色专区为了弥补上造受旱损失，各级党委都确定一个书记分管中稻护理工作，全专区已集中了十三万多个劳动力，组成一万零二百个专业队，开展了中稻一亩顶两亩的丰产运动。柳州专区中稻较多的南丹、大苗山、环江等县（自治县）也在加紧耘田追肥，开展超产运动。
    干部深入第一线以后，踏踏实实地解决了一些具体问题，大大提高了田间管理的质量和水平。环江县四级干部会师田间，和社员一起将禾苗分类排队，实行看土质、看禾苗、看基肥、看品种的四看追肥的办法。中南公社堂八大队四百三十亩中稻，经分类排队，有一百五十亩砂土田，每亩平均压青放绿肥十担；二百五十亩粘土田，每亩平均放牛粪二十担；三十亩半粘半砂田，每亩平均放八至十担人畜粪尿。对粳糯稻种，多施硫酸氨及其他肥料；对籼稻种，多施骨粉、过磷酸钙。经过四看追肥后，全队禾苗普遍生长旺盛，八十五亩三类禾也赶上一类。
    为了全面提高中稻的单位面积产量，各地在田间管理中，突出的抓紧了消灭三类禾的活动。
    内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区乌兰察布、昭乌达、包头等六个盟市，在当前农业生产关键季节，抽调80％的农村劳力加强秋田管理。
    位于大兴安岭南麓和西辽河流域的呼伦贝尔、哲里木、昭乌达三个盟三十三个旗县市，目前已集中一百万强壮男女劳动力，组成田间管理突击大军，大搞锄草、追肥、治虫、防涝。这些地区的秋田作物已全部锄完头遍草，正在抢锄二遍、三遍，对部分遭受风雹虫等灾害的田地也及时进行了抢救补种，苗情逐步好转。中共布特哈旗党委以农业为中心安排工作，抽调80％旗委委员深入公社生产队分片包干，加强生产第一线领导，并从全旗各机关、事业单位、学校抽调出二千多干部、职工、师生下乡，到后进队落户，帮助工作。现在，全旗七十六万亩大秋作物已结束了第三遍铲趟，大部分谷子拔过两次草，间过两次苗。由于田间管理水平步步提高，禾苗长得一片油绿。自治区西部旱情较严重的乌兰察布盟和林格尔、丰镇等十五个旗县市，从7月初就调集了85％以上的农村劳力和大批机关干部、工人、学生、解放军官兵抗旱保苗，他们采取蓄、引、掏、截、提等办法，大挖水源，扩大浇地面积，终于把一百五十多万亩受旱作物浇上了水，夏浇面积比6月末增加了两倍。
    内蒙古各地集中主力加强农业生产战线以来，全区秋季作物田间管理工作大为改观。二遍锄草面积已占应锄面积的78.7％，比去年同期提高了25.1％，追肥面积也比去年同期扩大了一倍多。
