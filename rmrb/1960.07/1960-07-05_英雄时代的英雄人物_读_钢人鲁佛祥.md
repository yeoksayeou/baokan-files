A heroic figure of the heroic age—Reading "Steel Man Lu Foxiang"
Shi Shaochu, worker of Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory

Hu Wanchun's "Steel Man Lu Foxiang" (see "One Day of the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai") is an excellent work filled with strong communist ideas. It unfolds the image of a hero who tirelessly works for the cause of socialist construction with utmost loyalty, layer by layer, before the readers. Reading it gives people a pleasant feeling.

"Steel Man Lu Foxiang" writes about real people and events from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2. The author even worked with Lu Foxiang for three or four years. Based on these real people and events, the work has undergone a certain degree of artistic processing in the character depiction, making the story more beautiful and moving. The character in the work—this loyal, simple, and humorous elderly hero—is also clearly expressed.

From Lu Foxiang's many sincere and moving words and actions, it can be clearly seen that after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the working class truly became the masters. As Lu Foxiang said to his son: "Now the factory is ours. Working to death is not for others, but for everyone, for ourselves, and also for your next generation..." Therefore, when the country has any difficulties or something happens in the factory, people should care for it and solve it with the attitude of masters. This is an excellent quality that the working class should possess. Lu Foxiang's typical and moving deeds are precisely the manifestations of this excellent quality in real life. The story tells us how admirable and moving deeds were displayed in him when Lu Foxiang was installing a twenty-ton flywheel for the rolling mill. For example, when he was in the sanatorium, how much he missed the factory; later, when he learned that the factory was going to install a twenty-ton flywheel, how restless he was, even lying and saying that his arthritis was better, wanting to get the院长's consent so he could return to the factory. Such concern for the cause of socialism is admirable. Later, when the factory actually sent someone to ask for a day's leave for him, asking him to guide the installation of the flywheel, how happy he was at that time. This mood is difficult to describe and is very touching.

After two days and two nights of continuous hard work, the flywheel was installed. He said excitedly: "A person is at his happiest at this time. It's like farming, when the harvest season comes, a year of hard work is offset. We have this kind of sweetness after only ten days of hard work. It's really more sweet than bitter!" How sincere and touching he speaks! But then, he saw a puff of green smoke suddenly coming out of the already installed flywheel bearing boss, and the flywheel stopped turning. He shouted, "The copper boss is burning!" At this time, he was so anxious that he lost his footing and fell under the car... If he did not have a high degree of loyalty to the cause of socialist construction, would he have fallen off the springboard because of his anxiety? Here, his care for state property and his excellent quality of loving the factory like his home are fully expressed. The flywheel burned again for the second time. From his questions to the people around him, it can be understood how anxious this simple and sincere elderly worker was. Therefore, when he learned that stopping for a day would result in at least 200 tons less steel produced, and dismantling the flywheel would cost at least tens of thousands of yuan, he sighed deeply. How much thought and emotion is contained in this sigh! Someone knew that he was not in good health and was afraid that he would be overworked, so they advised him to rest, but he said "angrily: 'Don't worry about me, an old man, go and worry about the flywheel!'" See, he doesn't care about himself at all! The story develops step by step here, and the old hero's loyal heart is also clearly expressed here.

Lu Foxiang's character is straightforward, resolute, and sincere. He is an optimistic person, and at the same time, he is so serious and conscientious. When he finally saw the flywheel turning, someone told him to go and rest quickly, but he suddenly disappeared from his original serious and sincere attitude and said humorously: "Hey! You don't have to tell me, I will go to rest, and I will also report to the sanatorium!" Reading this, one cannot help but applaud.

Some people say: Heroes are the products of the times. Indeed, we are now in a great era of emerging heroes, and their deeds are amazing.

"Steel Man Lu Foxiang" only reflects a fragment of the many heroic deeds that have appeared in our society. Lu Foxiang, this hero, is just one of countless heroes. May we constantly learn from the heroic deeds of heroic figures and be infected by their noble communist qualities.

### 英雄时代的英雄人物——读“钢人鲁佛祥”

    英雄时代的英雄人物——读“钢人鲁佛祥”
    上海玻璃机械厂工人  石绍初
    胡万春同志写的《钢人鲁佛祥》（见《上海大跃进的一日》），是一篇充满着强烈的共产主义思想的优秀作品，它把一个忠心耿耿为社会主义建设事业不倦劳动的英雄形象，层层深入地展开在读者的面前。读起来，给人一种愉快的感觉。
    《钢人鲁佛祥》写的是上钢二厂的真人真事，作者甚至曾和鲁佛祥一起工作过三、四年。作品就在这真人真事的基础上，在一定程度上对人物描写进行了艺术加工，使故事更为优美、动听，作品中的人物——这个忠诚、质朴、幽默的老年英雄的形象，也明显地表现出来了。
    从鲁佛祥的许多真挚动人的言语中和行动上，可以清楚地看出：解放以后，在党的领导下，工人阶级真正作了主人，正如鲁佛祥对他的儿子所说的：“现在厂是自己的，做死做活不是为了别人，是为了大家，为了自己，也是为了你们下一辈……。”因此当国家有什么困难，厂里发生了什么事的时候，人们就应该以主人公的态度去关怀它，解决它。这是工人阶级所应具有的优秀品质。鲁佛祥的这些典型的动人事迹，也正是这一优秀品质在现实生活中的表现。故事告诉我们，当鲁佛祥在为轧钢机安装一只二十吨重的大飞轮的时候，在他这个人身上表现出多么令人敬慕的动人事迹来。例如当他身在疗养院的时候，他是如何地想念着厂里的事；后来当他得知厂里要安装一只二十吨重的大飞轮的时候，他是如何地坐立不安，甚至于说谎，说他的关节炎好了，想来征得院长同意，他好回到厂里去。对社会主义事业这么关心，是令人敬佩的。后来厂里果然派人来为他请假一天，请他去指导安装大飞轮工作的时候，他那时的心情是多么的高兴，这种心情是难以使人形容的，而又是非常感动人的。
    经过两天两夜的连续苦战，大飞轮安装好了。他兴奋地说：“一个人到这种辰光，要算顶开心了。这就像种田一样，到了收刈的季节，一年辛苦都被抵消掉了。我们没辛苦了十天就有这种甜味，真是甜比苦多！”说得多么的真切，多么的感人！可是接下去，他看到已经装好了的大飞轮轴承婆司突然冒出了一股青烟，大飞轮停止了转动的时候，他叫了声“铜婆司烧起了！”这时，他一急，失脚跌到车弄下面来了……。如果他没有高度忠诚于社会主义建设事业的思想品质的话，他会因心里着急而跌下跳板吗？这里，他对国家财产的爱护，爱厂如家的优秀思想品质，都充分地表现出来了。大飞轮第二次又烧起来，从他向旁人的问话中，可以明白，这位纯朴、恳切的老年工人，他心里是如何地焦急，因此当他得知停一天至少要少生产二百多吨钢、把大飞轮拆下来起码要损失上万元的时候，他深深地叹了口气。这口气里包含着多少思想和感情！有人知道他身体不好，怕他辛劳过度，劝他休息，不料他却“气呼呼地说：别来关心我这老头子了，去关心大飞轮吧！”看，他哪里还顾得什么自己！故事写到这里，一步步发展，这位老英雄的赤胆忠心也在这里明彻地表现出来。
    鲁佛祥的性格是直率、刚毅和恳切的，他是一个乐观的人，同时他又是那样的严肃、认真。当他最后看到大飞轮转动起来的时候，有人叫他快去休息，他却突然消失了原来的那种认真、恳切的态度，风趣横生地说：“嗨！你不说我也会去休息的，而且我还要到疗养院去报到呢！”读到这里，不能不使人拍手称快。
  有人说：英雄是时代的产物。的确如此。我们现在正处在一个英雄辈出的伟大时代，他们的事迹是令人惊叹的。
    《钢人鲁佛祥》只是反映了我们这个社会里所出现的许多英雄事迹中的一个片段。鲁佛祥这个英雄人物，也只是无数的英雄人物中的一个罢了。愿我们不断地学习英雄人物的英雄事迹，从这些英雄人物的身上感染他们崇高的共产主义优秀品质。
