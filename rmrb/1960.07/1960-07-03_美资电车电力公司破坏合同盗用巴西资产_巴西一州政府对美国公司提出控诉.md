Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: Rio de Janeiro News: The government of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, filed a lawsuit in court on June 28th against the American-funded "Pernambuco Tram and Power Company" for failing to fulfill its contract and for stealing assets from the state. The "Pernambuco Tram and Power Company" belongs to the American "Electric Bond and Share Company" and operates the power supply and tram business in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, through a lease.

The Pernambuco state government is demanding the cancellation of the contract signed with the company and is asking the company to pay the state government a compensation of 600 million cruzeiros.

The Pernambuco state government alleges that the American company not only failed to fulfill the terms of the contract but also attempted to seize the state's movable and immovable property that it had stolen when the contract expired. The state government pointed out that the company had been fined for various illegal activities.

Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: Rio de Janeiro News: Gabriel Passos, a member of the Brazilian Nationalist Parliamentary Front, stated at a meeting of the review committee of the House of Representatives in Brasilia on June 29th that he supports a complete monopoly by Brazilian state-owned companies over the export of iron ore. Passos requested the parliamentary review committee to investigate the iron and manganese ore situation in Brazil and also investigate the connections between those who obtained leases to exploit these ores and foreign groups.

This meeting was initiated by members of the Brazilian Nationalist Parliamentary Front. The meeting demonstrated opposition to the American "Hanna Company" transporting iron ore produced in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais to foreign countries.

    据新华社1日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西伯南布哥州州政府在6月28日向法院控告美资“伯南布哥州电车、电力公司”没有履行合同，并且盗用这个州的资产。“伯南布哥州电车、电力公司”属于美国“电力证券股份公司”，它凭租借权经营伯南布哥州首府累西腓市的供电和电车业务。
    伯南布哥州政府要求废除同这家公司签订的合同，并且要求这家公司付给州政府六亿克鲁赛罗的补偿费。
    伯南布哥州州政府控诉说，这家美国公司不仅没有履行合同的条款，而且企图在合同期满时侵吞被它盗用的这个州的动产和不动产。州政府指出，这家公司由于干出各种违法活动曾经被判处过罚款。

    这次会议是由巴西民族主义者议会阵线的议员们发起的。会议表明反对美国“汉纳公司”要把巴西米纳斯吉拉斯州出产的铁矿运往外国。
