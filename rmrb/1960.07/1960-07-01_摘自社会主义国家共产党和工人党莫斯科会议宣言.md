The American imperialist aggressive bloc is trying to rule most countries in the world by relying on the so-called "position of strength" policy, and is trying to hinder mankind from advancing according to the laws of social development. Under the guise of "anti-communism," they are trying to eliminate democratic freedoms, threaten the national independence of developed capitalist countries, want to re-impose colonial shackles on the people who have already been liberated in new forms, and constantly carry out hostile subversive activities against socialist countries. The policy of certain aggressive groups in the United States is to gather all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world around them. In this way, these groups become the center of reactionary forces throughout the world and the most ferocious enemies of the masses.

    美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓“实力地位”政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。它们打着“反共”的幌子，力图消灭民主自由，威胁发达的资本主义国家的民族独立，想要以新的形式给已经解放了的人民重新套上殖民枷锁，并且经常不断地对社会主义国家进行敌对的颠覆活动。美国某些侵略集团的政策是要把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样，这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。
