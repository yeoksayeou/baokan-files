Chongqing, July 27th (from our newspaper) - Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, cadres from Chongqing city's banking departments have been going deep into rural people's communes in the suburbs to support poor teams in developing production in various ways. Currently, one hundred and sixty-seven poor teams have caught up with the level of local rich teams.

This year, banking departments at all levels throughout the city have made helping the poor catch up with the rich a major task in supporting agricultural production, formulating plans at each level, assigning responsibilities, and providing comprehensive support. Party organizations at all levels in the banking sector selected one hundred and eighty-two cadres to go deep into poor teams in the three counties of Ba County, Qijiang, and Changshou in the city's suburbs, as well as several districts. Under the leadership of the county and district Party committees, they worked together on rural tasks. Many people served as deputy team leaders and deputy branch secretaries, taking the poor team as their home, participating in production, and organizing and leading production. After entering the poor teams, they ate, lived, labored, and consulted with team cadres and commune members. They started by focusing on three things to carry out the work of helping the poor catch up with the rich: (1) Comparing and analyzing the differences between poor and rich teams to find the root causes of poverty; (2) Using listening, observing, asking, and comparing methods to understand the key problems in current production; (3) Visiting commune members to understand their living needs and listen to their opinions. These poor teams were mostly located in remote mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. The natural soil quality was generally poor, and they lacked water and fertilizer. Due to the scarcity of labor in the mountainous areas, sideline production did not develop quickly, and the production level was lower than that of ordinary teams. The average grain yield per mu of the one hundred and sixty-seven poor teams was 25% to 40% lower than that of the rich teams. The development of diversified operations was poor, and sideline production accounted for only 20% of the total income, which was about 20% lower than that of the rich teams. In particular, due to the severe drought last year, some poor teams still lacked food and money.

Based on the principle of "self-reliance as the mainstay, state support as a supplement," the bank cadres stationed in the teams, together with the team cadres, mobilized the masses to launch the "Aim High, Catch Up with Rich Teams" campaign. Under the leadership of the Party committee, more than 300 oath-taking and skills competition rallies were organized to encourage commune members to start a production upsurge. At the same time, 30% of the loans were given priority to the poor teams, taking care of the difficulties of poor teams lacking production funds. They also earnestly discussed with team cadres and commune members to help each team meticulously arrange production funds. All production teams used most of their funds to purchase chemical fertilizers and other means of production, build water conservancy projects, and run chemical fertilizer plants and agricultural tool factories. During this year's spring plowing production, with the help of bank cadres, more than one hundred poor teams built 263 weirs and ponds, increasing the irrigated area by more than 45,000 mu. They also built more than 300 local chemical fertilizer plants, producing more than 30 million jin of chemical fertilizer in a short period. In addition, bank cadres, based on the principle of considering the masses everywhere and implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in running communes, tried their best to save production funds for the masses. Many production teams in the mountainous areas had many production tools, but most of them were broken and had not been repaired. Bank cadres and team cadres mobilized commune members to rely on their own efforts to set up a large number of small agricultural tool factories, manufacturing and repairing more than 230,000 various agricultural tools, saving more than 200,000 yuan in production funds. After the poor teams solved the problems of water shortage and fertilizer shortage in production, they ensured a bumper harvest of summer crops this year.

Most of these poor teams did not have a fixed income, and diversified operations were not developed. A large amount of resources in the mountainous areas had not been utilized. According to the county party committee's instructions on "developing diversified operations, increasing cash income, and consolidating and improving people's communes," the bank cadres stationed in the teams started by helping each team formulate plans and arrange labor, widely seeking production avenues. They helped each team extract some labor as professional teams to collect "five treasures" in the mountains, run comprehensive utilization processing plants, aromatic oil plants, and open coal mines, brick and tile, and lime factories. Two hundred and ninety-eight various sideline production projects were arranged in one hundred and sixty-seven poor teams. In the first half of this year, each team increased its income by an average of more than 8,000 yuan.

While helping poor teams develop production, bank cadres stationed in the teams cooperated with commercial and grain departments to actively and enthusiastically arrange the lives of commune members in various ways. Bank cadres at all levels in Changshou, Ba County, and other places implemented living in canteens, acting as administrators and cooks, and providing three types of help to the canteens (helping the canteens develop family production, increase sideline income, helping establish and improve various management systems; helping to innovate cooking utensils). The appearance of many canteens has been greatly changed. With the help and guidance of bank cadres, more than 340 canteens in various poor teams in Ba County established vegetable bases, implemented special management, planted more than 11,000 mu of vegetables, raised an average of 12 pigs and 60 small poultry per canteen, and also developed some diversified operations to increase cash income. Based on the principle of "everyone does things for everyone, and the masses manage things for the masses," bank cadres also worked with team cadres to mobilize commune members to improve canteen work. Now, all 934 canteens in the poor teams have eliminated the third category of canteens, of which 387 canteens have also been rated as Red Flag canteens.

Now, the political ideology, production, and living conditions of all poor teams have undergone tremendous changes. The increase in spring crops in each production brigade this year is particularly significant, generally increasing by 35% to 150%. Early rice and mid-season rice were also fully planted and transplanted, growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. While developing grain production, the development of diversified operations in each production brigade is also very rapid. In the first half of this year, one hundred and sixty-seven poor teams increased their total income by more than 1.34 million yuan from the development of diversified operations. After launching the campaign to catch up with rich teams, commune members were full of energy, and their political and ideological outlook changed greatly. Among the more than 45,000 commune members in each team, more than 11,500 commune members were rated as production red flag bearers and activists. Now, after inspection and evaluation by the local Party committee, it has been approved that all one hundred and sixty-seven poor teams have caught up with the level of rich teams.

    重庆银行部门大力支援穷队赶富队
    以穷队为家，全面扶持生产，使一百六十七个穷队赶上了当地富队水平
    本报重庆27日电　重庆市各级银行部门的干部，在各级党委的统一领导下，深入市郊农村人民公社，从多方面扶持穷队发展生产。现在，已有一百六十七个穷队赶上了当地富队水平。
    今年，全市各级银行部门把帮穷赶富作为支援农业生产中的一项重大工作，层层制订了规划，分片包干，全面扶持。各级银行党组织选派了一百八十二名干部深入市郊巴县、綦江、长寿三县和几个区的穷队，他们在县、区委的领导下，统一做农村工作，许多人担任了副队长、支部副书记，以穷队为家，参与生产，组织领导生产。他们深入穷队以后，和队干部、社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，先从做好三件事入手，开展帮穷赶富工作：（1）对比分析穷队、富队差别，找出穷根；（2）用听、看、问、比办法，了解当前生产中的关键问题；（3）访问社员，了解他们的生活需要，听取群众意见。这些穷队都是在偏僻山区，交通不便，一般自然土质较差，缺水少肥；由于山区地多劳动力不足，副业生产发展也不快，生产水平比一般队低。一百六十七个穷队粮食亩产平均比富队低25％到40％；多种经营发展差，副业生产只占总收入的20％，比富队低20％左右，特别是因为去年遭受严重干旱，部分穷队还缺粮少钱。
    驻队的银行干部根据“自力更生为主，国家支援为辅”的原则，一面和队干部一同发动群众开展“立大志，赶富队”运动。在党委领导下，先后组织三百多次誓师比武大会，激励社员掀起生产高潮；一面把30％的贷款优先拨放到各个穷队，照顾穷队缺乏生产资金的困难，并认真同队干部和社员商量，帮助各队细致地安排生产资金。各个生产队都把大部资金用在购置化肥和其他生产资料、兴办水利工程和大办化肥厂、农具厂等上面。在今年春耕生产中有一百多个穷队，在银行干部的帮助下兴办了二百六十三处堰、塘，增灌面积四万五千多亩；兴办了三百多个土化肥厂，在短期内生产化肥达三千多万斤。另外，银行干部还本着处处为群众打算和贯彻执行勤俭办社方针，尽量为群众节约生产资金。山区的许多生产队的生产工具很多，但多数已坏了，没有修理。银行干部和队干部就发动社员自力更生办起大批小型农具厂，制造修理了二十三万多件各式农具，节约了二十万多元生产资金。穷队生产上解决了缺水少肥的问题后，保证了今年小春作物的丰收。
    这些穷队多数没有固定收入，多种经营不发达，山区的大量资源没有被利用。银行驻队干部根据县委“发展多种经营，增加现金收入，巩固提高人民公社”的指示，从帮助各队制订规划，安排劳动力着手，广找生产门路，帮助各队抽出部分劳力作为专业队伍，上山采集“五宝”、大办综合利用加工厂、芳香油厂、开办煤窑、砖瓦、石灰等工厂，在一百六十七个穷队中安排了二百九十八项各种副业生产，今年上半年平均每个队增加了八千多元的收入。
    在帮助穷队发展生产的同时，驻队银行干部配合商业、粮食部门又积极热情地从多方面安排社员生活。长寿、巴县等地各级银行干部实行住进食堂，当管理员，当炊事员，对食堂实行三帮（帮食堂发展家底生产，增加副业收入，帮建立和健全各种管理制度；帮革新炊具）。许多食堂的面貌大改观。在银行干部的帮助和指导下，巴县各个穷队的三百四十多个食堂都建立了蔬菜基地，实行专人管理，种了一万一千多亩蔬菜，平均每个食堂养猪十二头、小家禽六十只，还发展一部分多种经营，增加现金收入。银行干部根据“大家的事大家办，群众的事群众管”的原则，还和队干部一同发动社员改进食堂工作。现在，各穷队的九百三十四个食堂已全部消灭了三类食堂，其中有三百八十七个食堂还被评为红旗食堂。
    现在，全部穷队的政治思想、生产和生活面貌，都发生了巨大的变化。今年各生产大队春作物的增产幅度特别显著，一般都增产35％到150％。早稻和中稻也做到满栽满插，生长良好，丰收在望。在发展粮食生产的同时，各个生产大队，多种经营的发展也很快，今年上半年一百六十七个穷队从发展多种经营中总共增加了一百三十四万多元的收入。开展追赶富队运动后，社员干劲冲天，政治思想面貌大大变化。在各队的四万五千多社员中有一万一千五百多社员被评为生产红旗手和积极分子。现在经过当地党委检查、评比，批准一百六十七个穷队，全部赶上了富队水平。
