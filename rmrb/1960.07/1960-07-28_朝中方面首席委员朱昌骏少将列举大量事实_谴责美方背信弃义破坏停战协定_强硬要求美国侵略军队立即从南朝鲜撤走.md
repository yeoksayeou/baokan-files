Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th: Panmunjom News: At the 123rd meeting of the Military Armistice Commission today, Major General Zhu Changjun, Chief Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, exposed and condemned the U.S. side's crimes of systematically and deliberately undermining and trampling on the Armistice Agreement over the past seven years. Major General Zhu Changjun once again strongly demanded that the U.S. side withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and the atomic weapons and missiles it illegally brought into South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that seven years have passed since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but to this day, U.S. aggressor troops are still forcibly occupying South Korea. The reunification of Korea has not yet been realized, and peace in Korea is still under serious threat. All of this is the result of the U.S. side's treacherous behavior and continued pursuit of an aggressive and war-like policy in South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that in the past seven years, in order to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the U.S. side has brazenly sabotaged the convening of the higher-level political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement and the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, and has stubbornly rejected all the legitimate proposals put forward by the Korean-Chinese side that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that in order to launch a new war of aggression, the U.S. side is frantically increasing its military strength in South Korea. In the past seven years, the U.S. side has not only illegally transported atomic weapons and missiles, etc., into South Korea, established missile bases in South Korea, and reorganized the U.S. forces occupying South Korea into atomic units, but has also expanded the South Korean puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions, and recently plans to reorganize the South Korean puppet army into atomic units. In order to achieve these goals, the U.S. side brazenly drove the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission out of South Korea in June 1956, and unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement, which prohibited the introduction of reinforcing combat equipment, in June 1957.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that in order to create tension in Korea, the U.S. side has constantly violated the Armistice Agreement and carried out provocative and hostile acts against the Korean-Chinese side from the ground, sea, and air. In the past seven years, the U.S. side has dispatched a large number of military aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side to conduct aerial reconnaissance, dispatched a large number of agents to conduct espionage activities in the Korean-Chinese side, and dispatched armed vessels and personnel to intrude into the northern Korean coastal waters and coastal areas to conduct hostile acts. He pointed out that on July 22, a U.S. naval vessel used dense fog to intrude into the waters about one kilometer northwest of Feiya Island, an island off the northern coast of Korea, and launched a provocative armed attack on the Korean-Chinese side's coast guard艇. He also said that the U.S. side is constantly conducting frequent "atomic assault exercises" and "atomic weapons demonstration exercises" in South Korea, continuously launching atomic weapons and missiles, and recently transferring a large number of U.S. troops from the United States to South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun emphasized that the historical facts of the past seven years since the armistice clearly show that although the U.S. side signed the Armistice Agreement, it had no intention of abiding by the Armistice Agreement from the very beginning. If the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops do not withdraw from South Korea, the peaceful reunification of Korea stipulated in the Armistice Agreement cannot be realized, the misfortune and suffering of the Korean people cannot be alleviated, and the threat of war in Korea cannot be eliminated.

Major General Zhu Changjun said: "In accordance with the requirements of the Armistice Agreement, and in the name of the entire Korean people, I strongly demand that the U.S. side immediately stop its actions to prepare for a new war in South Korea, and without delay withdraw the U.S. troops and new weapons such as atomic weapons and missiles that were illegally brought into South Korea."

The U.S. side's Chief Member Dawson reiterated his old tricks at today's meeting, saying that the withdrawal issue was a "political issue" and that the U.S. side "had no need to answer" the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that the U.S. side's attitude not only shows that it is unwilling to comply with the obligations imposed on it by the Armistice Agreement, but also shows that it attempts to permanently occupy South Korea and turn it into a war base for launching a new war, and to seize the opportunity to tear up the ceasefire terms and launch a new war against the Korean people.

Major General Zhu Changjun finally pointed out that as a result of the U.S. side's forcible occupation of South Korea for fifteen years, South Korea has become a veritable hell on earth, and the South Korean people are in deep water. Today, the South Korean people are rising up to fight for a new life, a new politics, and a new system, and are continuing their heroic struggle to drive out the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops who have brought them profound disasters. Therefore, withdrawing the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea is not only a strict requirement of the Armistice Agreement, but also an urgent demand of the entire Korean people. The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops have no reason to stay in South Korea. The Korean-Chinese side will continue to hold the U.S. side accountable until the U.S. side fulfills the Armistice Agreement and the demands of the Korean people.

### 朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将列举大量事实  谴责美方背信弃义破坏停战协定  强硬要求美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤走

    朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将列举大量事实
    谴责美方背信弃义破坏停战协定
    强硬要求美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤走
    新华社平壤27日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在军事停战委员会第一百二十三次会议上，揭露和谴责了美方七年来背信弃义有系统地、有计划地破坏和蹂躏停战协定的罪行。朱昌骏少将再次强硬要求美方把美帝国主义侵略军和它非法运入的原子武器和导弹撤出南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将指出，自朝鲜停战协定签字以来，七年过去了，但是至今美国侵略军仍然强占着南朝鲜。朝鲜的统一尚未实现，朝鲜的和平依然受到严重的威胁，这一切都是美方背信弃义的行为和继续在南朝鲜推行侵略和战争政策的结果。
    朱昌骏少将指出，七年来，美方为了阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，悍然破坏停战协定第六十款所规定的高一级政治会议的召开和日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，顽固地拒绝了朝中方面提出的有利于和平解决朝鲜问题的一切正当建议。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方为了发动新的侵略战争，疯狂地在南朝鲜增强军事力量。七年来，美方不仅非法运入了原子武器和导弹等，在南朝鲜建立了导弹基地，把强占南朝鲜的美军改编为原子部队，而且还把南朝鲜的伪军从停战时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师，最近又准备把南朝鲜的伪军编为原子部队。为了达到这些目的，美方在1956年6月蛮横地把中立国视察小组赶出南朝鲜，并在1957年6月片面地宣布废除禁止运入增援性作战物资的停战协定第十三款卯项。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方为了在朝鲜制造紧张局势，不断违反停战协定，从地面、海上和空中，对朝中方面进行挑衅性敌对行为。七年来美方派遣了大量军用飞机侵入朝中方面地区上空，进行空中侦察，派遣了大批特务到朝中方面地区进行间谍活动，并派遣武装船只和人员侵入朝鲜北部沿海海面和海岸地区进行敌对行为。他指出，7月22日，美方海军舰艇一艘曾利用浓雾侵入朝鲜北部沿海岛屿飞鸭岛西北约一公里的海面，向朝中方面的海岸警备艇发动了挑衅性的武装攻击。他又说，美方还不断在南朝鲜频繁地进行“原子突击演习”和“原子武器示范演习”，接连发射原子武器和导弹，最近又从美国向南朝鲜调运大批美军兵力。
    朱昌骏少将强调指出，停战七年来的历史事实清楚地表明，美方虽然签署了停战协定，但一开始就根本无意遵守停战协定。如果美帝国主义侵略军不撤出南朝鲜，就不能实现停战协定所规定的朝鲜的和平统一，就不能解除朝鲜人民的不幸和痛苦，也就不能消除朝鲜的战争威胁。
    朱昌骏少将说：“我按照停战协定的要求，并以全体朝鲜人民的名义，强硬要求美方立即停止在南朝鲜准备发动新战争的行动，并且毫不迟延的把美军以及非法运进的原子武器和导弹等新武器从南朝鲜撤出去。”
    美方首席委员陶逊在今天的会议上重施故技，又说什么撤军问题是“政治问题”，美方“没有必要答复”朝中方面的要求。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方这种态度不仅说明美方不愿遵守停战协定加于美方的义务，而且说明了美方企图永久霸占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成美方的发动新战争的战争策源地，伺机撕毁停火条款，发动反对朝鲜人民的新战争。
    朱昌骏少将最后指出，十五年来美方强占南朝鲜的结果，已经使得南朝鲜沦为名副其实的人间地狱，南朝鲜人民处于水深火热之中。今天南朝鲜人民为了争取新生活、新政治和新制度，正在奋起为赶走给他们带来深重灾难的美帝国主义侵略军而继续进行着英勇的斗争，因此从南朝鲜撤出美帝国主义侵略军不仅是停战协定的严格要求，而且也是全朝鲜人民的迫切要求。美帝国主义侵略军没有任何理由可以赖在南朝鲜不走。朝中方面将继续追究美方的责任，直到美方实现停战协定和朝鲜人民的要求时为止。
