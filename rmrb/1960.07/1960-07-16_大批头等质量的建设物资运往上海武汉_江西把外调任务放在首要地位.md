Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 15th: Under the guidance of the national unified planning, workers in various parts of Jiangxi Province are promoting the spirit of prioritizing the needs of others and the needs of the state, and are transferring more and better pig iron, coal, wood, and other construction materials to Shanghai, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and other places, fully supporting key national construction projects.

In the first half of this year, Jiangxi Province's external transfer of materials has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Taking iron, coal, and wood as examples, pig iron increased by 55%, wood by 93%, and coal by 25%. The quality of externally transferred products has also greatly improved. The pig iron transferred to Shanghai was rated as first-class, earning praise from many units.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to external transfer work, frequently including it in the provincial committee's agenda. To strengthen leadership over external transfer work, Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, has personally taken charge since last year, designating a special external transfer agency to report to him once a day, resolving any problems immediately. For example, in February of this year, Lianhua, Anfu, and other counties lacked forty-five trucks, preventing a large amount of pig iron from being transported to railway lines in a timely manner. After Comrade Bai Dongcai discovered this situation, he immediately instructed the Provincial Transportation Command to make unified arrangements, utilizing every opportunity to mobilize trucks from Xinyu, Fenyi, and other places overnight to rush to the aforementioned areas. Within four days, they transported over 1,600 tons of pig iron to the railway lines, promptly delivering them to Shanghai.

Regions with external transfer tasks take pride in delivering on time, in quantity, and in quality. Regions without external transfer tasks also do not miss any opportunity to support key national construction projects. For example, the Jiujiang Special District, which was not assigned an external transfer task for pig iron by the provincial committee, repeatedly requested the provincial committee to assign a portion of pig iron for external transfer upon hearing that Shanghai needed it. With the approval of the provincial committee, each iron smelting plant immediately selected over 600 tons of the best pig iron, rushing them to Shanghai day and night by both land and water. Fenyi County in the Yichun Special District, which had no external transfer task and no pig iron to transfer, served as a transit station for the transfer of pig iron from the Ji'an Special District to railway lines, with large quantities of materials passing through here en route to Shanghai. As a result, the loading and unloading capacity of the railway station was often unable to cope. The cadres and workers of Fenyi County immediately seized this opportunity to support key projects, frequently going to the railway station to assist with loading and unloading.

In the process of accelerating the transfer of materials, close cooperation between the province's production and transportation departments played a significant role. All regions and enterprises universally implemented a one-stop production, transportation, and sales system with fixed points, fixed routes, fixed quantities, fixed times, and fixed vehicles. Production departments ensured that externally bound vehicles and ships were loaded and dispatched immediately upon arrival. Transportation departments prioritized externally transferred materials, dedicating a large number of modern vehicles and ships specifically for the transportation of externally bound materials, ensuring that vehicles were available whenever there were goods. For example, the railway department dedicated 400 railcars, transporting coal, pig iron, and other externally transferred materials day and night. (Attached picture)

### 大批头等质量的建设物资运往上海武汉　江西把外调任务放在首要地位

　　大批头等质量的建设物资运往上海武汉
　　江西把外调任务放在首要地位
    据新华社南昌15日电　在全国一盘棋的方针指导下，江西省各地职工发扬先外后内，先人后己的精神，把更多更好的生铁、煤炭、木材等建设物资源源调往上海、武钢等地，全力支援国家重点建设。
    今年上半年，江西全省外调物资比去年同期都有巨大增长。以铁、煤、木三项主要物资为例，生铁增长55％，木材增长93％，煤炭增长25％。外调产品质量也都有很大提高，调给上海的生铁，被评为第一类，获得许多单位的赞扬。
    中共江西省委十分重视外调工作，经常把它列入省委的议事日程。为了加强对外调工作的领导，中共江西省委书记白栋材，从去年以来就一直坚持了亲自挂帅，指定专门的外调机构一天向他回报一次，发现问题就马上解决。如今年2月间，莲花、安福等县因缺少四十五部汽车，大批生铁不能及时运往铁路沿线。白栋材同志发现这一情况后，立即指示省交通运输指挥部统一安排，见缝插针，连夜从新喻、分宜等地调集了汽车赶到上述地区，在四天内就抢运出一千六百多吨生铁到铁路线上，及时运到了上海。
    有外调任务的地区以按时、按量、按质外调为荣；没有外调任务的地区，同样没有放过为支援国家重点建设的任何机会。如九江专区，省委没有安排外调生铁任务，但他们听说上海需要生铁，就三番五次主动要求省委给一部分生铁外调任务。经省委同意后，各炼铁厂立即挑选出了最好的生铁六百多吨，水陆并进，日夜兼程抢运到了上海。宜春专区的分宜县，无外调任务，也无生铁可调，但是这个县的县城是吉安专区生铁调运到铁路沿线的一个中转站，大批物资通过这里运往上海，因此火车站装卸搬运力量经常无法应付。分宜县的干部、职工立即抓住这个支援重点的机会，经常到火车站去帮助装卸搬运。
    在加快外调物资的过程中，全省生产部门与运输部门紧密协作，起了很大作用。各地区、各企业都普遍实行了定点、定线、定量、定时、定车的产、运、销一条龙。生产部门保证外调车船随到随发货；运输部门把外调物资列入了运输首位，固定了大批现代化车船运力专运外调物资，做到有货就有车。如铁路部门，固定了四百个车皮，日夜调运煤炭、生铁等外调物资。（附图片）
