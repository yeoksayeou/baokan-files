Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th - The Cuban people are mobilizing nationwide to thoroughly crush the US imperialist threats and sinister plans to interfere in Cuba.

A surge of anger protesting the US threat to Cuba by reducing sugar imports is sweeping the country. In recent days, anti-US imperialist rallies have been held in Manzanillo, Pinar del Río, Güines, and many other cities. Defense of the Revolution Committees have been organized among residents in Regla, Bauta, Güines, and other cities. In Guantanamo, a grand rally of 25,000 people was held on the 4th, where representatives of workers, peasants, and other classes unanimously condemned US economic aggression and expressed support for the government's takeover of imperialist refineries.

Countless telegrams have been sent to the capital from all over the country. Workers at the Atlantic Gulf Sugar Company in Cuba said in a telegram: "We demand that the revolutionary government take over the Atlantic Gulf Sugar Company. Better to cancel the (US import of Cuban sugar) quota than to be slaves!" More than 20,000 farmers in Victoria de las Tunas, Oriente Province, said in a telegram that they are determined to make the greatest sacrifices to defend national sovereignty. The Camagüey Provincial Construction Workers' Union telegrammed: "We recognize that direct action must be taken against imperialist threats! Counter imperialist arrogance with takeover! Answer (the US) threat of reducing sugar quotas with the unity of the entire Cuban people!"

The Havana City Congress of the People's Socialist Party, which is in session, passed a call to action, urging workers and the people to continue to unite closely in order to defeat imperialist aggression at any cost.

The Free Latin America Association announced that "the new (US) act of aggression, which has aroused the just indignation of the people of Latin America and the world, must not bring Cuba to its knees."

The Executive Committee of the National Sugar Workers' Federation made a resolution stating that workers in Cuba's 37 American sugar factories are prepared to implement the government's decision to nationalize or confiscate these enterprises if it deems it necessary. The National Sugar Workers' Federation also decided that all sugar trade unions will hold massive rallies on the 9th to express support for the measures the government will take.

Jesús Soto, Organizing Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, said that if the US Congress gave Eisenhower the power to reduce our sugar quota, then we Cuban workers give the government full power to take all measures it deems necessary.

Today's "Hoy" published an editorial pointing out that the US economic threat has not frightened the Cuban people and their revolutionary government. Not only have they not retreated and succumbed to the demands of Washington and the monopoly groups, but they have also strengthened their position and more resolutely exercised national sovereignty and advanced the revolution.

"Hoy" emphasized that in the first important round against economic aggression, the imperialists were defeated. However, the economic war launched by the oil trusts is not over.

The editorial called on the Cuban people to prepare for a long-term struggle in order to finally win economic independence. The editorial emphasized that in this economic war, we must have broader domestic unity. We can say with confidence: We will win!

"Sierra Maestra" pointed out that this economic struggle is of decisive significance not only for Cuba but also for the entire Latin America. Cuba will surely win, thereby shattering another myth: the myth that "it is necessary to be dependent on US control and monopoly."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Jiménez, head of the Cuban economic delegation visiting the German Democratic Republic and director of the Cuban National Institute of Agrarian Reform, pointed out in a radio speech on the 4th that the Cuban government's policy of national economic liberation has provoked attacks by US imperialists. However, the Cuban people are ready for the struggle against imperialism, and they will never retreat in this struggle.

Jiménez pointed out that US imperialists are trying to isolate Cuba. But the Castro government is determined to pursue its own independent policy.

Jiménez said that the Cuban government is prepared to maintain trade and cultural relations with all countries on earth. He expressed his hope that economic relations with the German Democratic Republic and the friendship between the two peoples will be strengthened day by day.

    关塔那摩二万五千人集会支持政府接管帝国主义炼油厂
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴全国人民正在动员起来，以便彻底粉碎美帝国主义威胁和干涉古巴的罪恶计划。
    抗议美国以削减进口古巴糖来威胁古巴的怒潮在全国汹涌澎湃。这几天来，曼萨尼罗、比那尔德里奥、吉内斯以及其他许多城市都举行了反对美帝国主义的抗议集会。雷格拉、包塔、吉内斯和其他城市里，在居民中组织了保卫革命委员会。在关塔那摩，4日举行了有二万五千人参加的盛大集会，工人、农民和其他阶层的代表在会上一致谴责美国的经济侵略，表示支持政府接管帝国主义炼油厂。
    从全国各地向首都发来了无数的电报。美国的大西洋海湾糖厂的工人在电报中说：“我们要求革命政府接管大西洋海湾糖厂。宁可取消（美国进口古巴糖的）份额，也不当奴仆！”奥连特省维多利亚图纳斯两万多农民在电报中说，他们决心为保卫国家主权而做出最大的牺牲。卡马圭省建筑工会的电报说：“我们认识到，对于帝国主义的威胁，必须采取直接的行动！以接管来对付帝国主义的狂妄无理！以古巴全国人民的团结来回答（美国）削减食糖份额的威胁！”
    正在举行会议的人民社会党哈瓦那市代表大会通过了一个号召书，号召工人和人民继续紧密地团结在一起，以便不惜任何代价地击败帝国主义的侵略。
    自由拉丁美洲协会宣布，“激起拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民正当愤慨的（美国）新的侵略行为，决不能使古巴屈膝。”
    全国糖业工人联合会执行委员会做出的决议说，在古巴的三十七个美国糖厂的工人已经做好了准备，以便执行政府一旦认为应该把这些企业收归国有或者加以没收的决定。全国糖业工人联合会同时决定，一切糖业工会将在9日举行声势浩大的集会，表示支持政府将要采取的措施。
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托说，如果说美国国会给了艾森豪威尔以削减我们食糖份额的权力，那末我们古巴工人则给予政府全权来采取一切它认为有必要采取的措施。
    “今日报”今天发表的社论指出，美国的经济威胁没有吓倒古巴人民及其革命政府。他们非但没有退却和屈从华盛顿和垄断集团的要求，而且更加坚定了自己的立场，更加坚决地行使了国家主权和推进了革命。
      “今日报”强调指出，在反对经济侵略的第一个重要回合中，帝国主义者遭到了失败。但是，石油托辣斯发动的经济战还没有结束。
    社论号召古巴人民做好长期斗争准备，以便最后赢得经济独立。社论强调说，在这场经济战中，我们必须有更加广泛的国内团结。我们可以满怀信心地说：我们必胜！
    “马埃斯特腊山报”指出，这一场经济斗争不仅对古巴，而且对整个拉丁美洲都具有决定性的意义。古巴必将获得胜利，从而粉碎另一个神话：“必需依附美国的控制和垄断”的神话。
    新华社柏林5日电　正在德意志民主共和国访问的古巴经济代表团团长、古巴土地改革全国委员会主任希门尼斯4日在一次广播演说中指出，古巴政府采取的国家经济解放政策引起了美帝国主义者的攻击。但是，古巴人民已经准备好对帝国主义的斗争，他们在这一斗争中决不退却。
    希门尼斯指出，美帝国主义者企图孤立古巴。但是卡斯特罗政府坚决执行它自己的独立政策。
    希门尼斯说，古巴政府准备同地球上所有的国家保持贸易和文化关系。他表示希望同德意志民主共和国的经济关系以及两国人民之间的友谊将日益加强。
