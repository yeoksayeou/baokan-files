Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 7th: The Italian people's anti-fascist struggle is surging. Yesterday, tens of thousands held a massive demonstration in Rome to protest the authorities' ban on anti-fascist gatherings. The Italian authorities mobilized two thousand police to carry out bloody suppression.

The public in the Italian capital, disregarding the authorities' ban, responded to the call of the National Committee of the Resistance Movement yesterday and gathered in St. Paul's Square in Rome to hold an anti-fascist demonstration and prepare to lay wreaths at the monument to the soldiers and martyrs of the 1943 anti-fascist struggle.

The Italian authorities mobilized a large number of mounted police and motorcycle police to suppress the demonstrators, creating a large-scale bloody tragedy. More than a hundred people were injured, and more than twenty seriously injured were sent to the hospital, including Communist Party member of parliament Audisio and Socialist Party member of parliament Borges. Borges was covered in blood when he returned to the Chamber of Deputies.

The police also arrested more than six hundred people, including four Communist Party members of parliament, including Ingrao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party.

The police's atrocities aroused even greater anger among the demonstrators, who shouted in unison: "Murderers, fascists!" Demonstrators retaliated against the police, who were waving unsheathed knives, clubs, water cannons, tear gas and grenades, with a hail of stones.

The anti-fascist demonstration in Rome was a profound development of the recent vigorous anti-fascist struggle of the people throughout Italy. A series of demonstrations recently held in Genoa forced the neo-fascist party to cancel its scheduled congress there.

When the Rome demonstrators gathered in St. Paul's Square yesterday to express their hatred for fascism, motorized and helmeted police launched a barbaric attack on the crowd.

The Italian authorities, having learned of the demonstration in advance, were very nervous. They issued a ban on gatherings the day before and carried out suppression deployments in advance. The entire downtown area of Rome became an armed camp. Trucks of police and gendarmes were parked on every strategic corner. The largest concentration of forces was at the demonstrators' assembly point – St. Paul's Gate.

The authorities' bloody atrocities aroused great indignation among the Italian democratic public. At yesterday's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies and today's meeting of the Senate, many members of parliament strongly protested the authorities' atrocities. Fights broke out in the Chamber of Deputies between members of parliament protesting the authorities' atrocities and reactionary members of parliament. At the Senate meeting, Italian Minister of the Interior Spataro attempted to give a "report" on the Italian government's bloody suppression of anti-fascist demonstrators yesterday, but he was unable to take the stage amidst the angry condemnation of many members of parliament.

At the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Rome held an eleven-hour general strike today in support of the anti-fascist demonstrators. Subsequently, strikes were also held in Bologna, Ferrara and Livorno in northern Italy. The General Confederation of Labor today also called for general strikes in major Italian cities in support of the anti-fascist demonstrations.

Milan will begin a twenty-four-hour general strike from 23:00 tonight.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 7th: A huge wave of struggle is sweeping across Italy to oppose the government's reactionary policies and strive for better living and working conditions.

On July 5th, a mass demonstration was held in the town of Licata on the island of Sicily to protest the government's economic policies. Because the police fired on the crowd, one young worker was shot and killed, four people were seriously injured, and dozens were slightly injured.

Despite such a barbaric attack on the masses by the police, the demonstration continued from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm. The demonstration was initiated by labor organizations in Licata. Twenty thousand people participated in the demonstration, which is about half of the population of the town of Licata. The demonstrators marched through the streets, held a rally on the docks of the port, and blocked the railway station. Later, when police reserves were called in, the demonstrators dismantled a pontoon bridge to prevent them from advancing.

The residents of the city of Licata are deeply harmed by the government's economic policies. The number of unemployed is increasing, the city's port has ceased operations, and agriculture is heading towards ruin. In the past five months, 1,500 people have been forced to leave the city and move elsewhere.

In addition to the mass demonstration in Licata, in Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, Florence and other seven major cities, all gas workers in private enterprises have begun a four-day strike.

Two million tenant farmers also began a six-day nationwide "market strike" on the 5th. This is a new form of struggle. During the strike, tenant farmers refuse to transport any agricultural products to the market.

Tens of thousands of housewives who process clothing for the clothing industry also went on strike on the 5th, and they also held several demonstrations. In the factories of the "Richard Ginori" ceramics company, workers decided to hold a forty-eight-hour strike starting today. Forty thousand foundry workers will also hold a nationwide strike today.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 6th: Residents of Reggio Emilia in southern Italy held an anti-fascist demonstration yesterday.

Reggio Emilia was one of the centers of the Italian resistance movement against fascism and Nazism during World War II. Yesterday evening, under the organization of the Emilia Province Resistance Movement Committee, an open-air mass meeting was held in the city center.

The demonstrators demanded that the neo-fascist party be declared illegal in accordance with the provisions of the Italian Constitution, which prohibits the organization of fascist groups.

The meeting ended at midnight, but people still went to demonstrate in front of the Reggio Emilia headquarters of the neo-fascist party.

Police came out to protect the fascist party headquarters. They attacked the demonstrators with tear gas and illegally arrested eighteen people.

With the connivance of the government, Italian fascists continue to be rampant. Yesterday evening, fascists set fire to the residence of Communist Party member of parliament and chairman of the Italian National Guerrilla Fighters Association, Boldrini, in Ravenna, northern Italy, and also left reactionary slogans such as "Kill the guerrillas" and "Long live fascism." Fascists in Rome threw explosives at a branch of the Italian Communist Party.

    罗马万人大示威反对法西斯
    意大利反动政府进行血腥镇压激起全国愤怒抗议
    利卡塔人民倾城示威　警察开枪镇压　死伤群众数十人
    新华社7日讯　罗马消息：意大利人民反法西斯斗争声势澎湃，昨天在罗马举行了万人大示威，抗议当局禁止反法西斯集会。意大利当局调动两千名警察进行血腥镇压。
    意大利首都的公众不顾当局的禁令，昨天响应抵抗运动全国委员会的号召，集会在罗马的圣保罗广场，举行反法西斯示威，并且准备向1943年反法西斯斗争的战士和牺牲者纪念碑前献花圈。
    意大利当局调动大批骑警和摩托警察镇压示威群众，制造了大规模的流血惨案。一百多人受伤，二十多个伤势严重的人被送进医院，其中包括共产党议员奥迪西欧和社会党议员波尔格塞。波尔格塞在回到众议院时，浑身都是血。
    警察还逮捕了六百多人，其中有四位共产党议员，包括意共书记处书记英格拉奥。
    警察的暴行激起示威者更大的怒火，他们万众一声地高呼：“谋杀分子，法西斯分子！”示威者用雨点般的石块向挥舞着出鞘的刀、棍棒、水龙和催泪弹和手榴弹进攻示威队伍的警察还击。
    罗马的这次反法西斯示威是最近在意大利各地人民蓬勃开展的反法西斯斗争的深入发展。最近在热那亚举行的一系列示威曾迫使新法西斯党撤销了预定在那里举行的代表大会。
    当罗马示威者昨天在圣保罗广场集会以表示他们对法西斯主义的憎恨的时候，摩托化和头带钢盔的警察就向人群发动了野蛮的袭击。
    预先得知这次示威消息的意大利当局非常紧张，它在头一天就发出了禁止集会的命令，同时事先进行镇压部署。罗马的整个闹区成了一所武装的兵营。警察和宪兵的卡车停放在每一个能作战的拐角。兵力集中最多的是在示威者的集会地点——圣保罗门。
    当局的血腥暴行激起意大利民主公众的极大愤慨。在昨天众议院举行的会议上和今天参议院举行的会议上，不少议员强烈抗议当局的暴行。众议院中发生了抗议当局暴行的议员们和反动议员们的搏斗。在参议院的会议上，意大利内政部长斯帕塔罗企图就意大利政府昨天血腥镇压反法西斯示威群众的事件作“报告”，但是，在许多议员的愤怒谴责之下，他没有能够上台讲话。
    在意大利总工会的号召下，罗马全城在今天举行了十一个小时的总罢工，声援反法西斯示威者。接着，在意大利北部的波伦亚、斐拉拉和里窝那也举行了罢工。总工会今天还号召意大利各大城市都举行总罢工来声援反法西斯示威。
    米兰将从今天夜间二十三点开始举行二十四小时总罢工。
    新华社7日讯　罗马消息：在整个意大利，正在掀起一个为反对政府的反动政策和争取更好的生活和劳动条件而斗争的巨浪。
    7月5日在西西里岛上的利卡塔镇举行了一次群众性的示威，抗议政府的经济政策。由于警察向群众开枪，有一个青年工人被打死，四个人受重伤，好几十人受轻伤。
    尽管警察这样野蛮地袭击群众，示威仍然从早上八点一直继续到晚上八点半。这次示威是由利卡塔的劳工组织发起的。参加这次示威的有两万人，大约等于利卡塔镇人口的一半。示威者列队通过了大街，在港口的码头上举行了集会并且封锁了火车站。后来，当警察的后备部队调来的时候，示威者还拆掉了一个便桥以便阻止他们前进。
    利卡塔城的居民受政府的经济政策之害很深，失业人数正在增加，这个城的码头停止了活动，农业正在走向毁灭，在过去五个月中就有一千五百人被迫离开这个城迁移到别处去。
    除了利卡塔的群众性示威以外，在罗马、米兰、都灵、那不勒斯、佛罗伦萨和其他七大城市中，所有私营企业的煤气工人已经开始了一次为期四天的罢工。
    两百万佃农从5日开始也举行六天的全国范围的“市场罢工”。这是一种新形式的斗争，在罢工期间，佃农拒绝向市场运送任何农产品。
    为服装工业加工的成千上万的家庭妇女5日也举行罢工，她们还举行了几次示威。在“理查德·吉诺里”制陶企业的工厂中，工人们决定从今天开始举行四十八小时罢工。四万翻砂工人今天也将举行全国性罢工。
    新华社6日讯　罗马消息：意大利南部勒佐—艾米里亚的居民昨天举行反法西斯示威。
    勒佐—艾米里亚是第二次世界大战时期反对法西斯和纳粹主义的意大利抵抗运动的中心之一，昨天晚上，在艾米里亚省抵抗运动委员会的组织之下，在这个城市的市中心举行了露天的群众大会。
    示威群众要求按照意大利宪法不准组织法西斯团体的规定，宣布新法西斯党非法。
    大会散会时已经半夜，但是人们还到新法西斯党勒佐—艾米里亚的总部面前去示威。
    警察出来保护法西斯党的总部，他们用催泪弹攻击示威者，并且非法逮捕了十八个人。
    在政府纵容下，意大利法西斯分子继续在猖獗活动。昨天晚上，法西斯分子在意大利北部的拉温那，在意大利共产党议员、意大利全国游击战士协会主席波尔德里尼的寓所纵火，并且还留下了“杀死游击队员”、“法西斯主义万岁”等反动标语。罗马的法西斯分子向意大利共产党一个支部扔了爆炸物。
