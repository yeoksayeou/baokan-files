    Yelinzhuang Production Team's Experience in Silage
    The Office of the Wuqiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China

    In order to rapidly develop pig farming, the Yelinzhuang Production Team of Wangtong Commune, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, seized the great opportunity of lush summer weeds and actively mobilized the masses to collect wild grasses and vegetables to make silage. As of July 15, the team had collected more than 1.5 million catties of wild grasses and vegetables, which, in addition to ensuring the current consumption of 4,040 pigs, also ensiled 960,000 catties.

    In the vigorous silage campaign, the Yelinzhuang Production Team mainly adopted specific measures such as putting politics in command, prioritizing ideology, carefully summarizing the technical experience of silage in recent years, comprehensively arranging labor, and reasonable remuneration.

    I. Adhering to putting politics in command and unifying thinking at all levels is the primary key to vigorously developing silage over the years. Especially this year, due to the drought in the previous period, most of the labor was concentrated on fighting the drought; in the later period, the management of spring and summer crops was squeezed together, which meant that there was not only a lot of farm work, but also insufficient labor. Therefore, some cadres and the masses initially believed that "this year there are no conditions for silage"; some were even afraid that silage would "delay production," etc. In response to the above situation, the general branch committee mobilized the masses to summarize the benefits and experiences of vigorously developing silage in recent years. After summarizing, people unanimously realized that vigorously developing silage is the key to ensuring the rapid development of pigs. In recent years, due to the vigorous development of silage, the needs of pig raising have been met, and the great development of pig raising has been promoted. In 1956, the team only had 863 pigs, and now it has developed to 4,040, with an average of 2.5 pigs per household. Silage is not only widely sourced, but also low in cost. The production team uses work points and cash to exchange for wild grasses and vegetables collected by members, which can also solve the problem of pocket money for members. On the basis of unified thinking, the general branch committee calculated the feed requirements based on the pig development situation this year. The team plans to develop 10,000 pigs by the end of the year, requiring a total of more than 15 million catties of feed. Feed land and idle land can produce 3 million catties, and by-products such as corn kernels, sweet potato vines, and cotton shells can bring in 7 million catties, plus 1.02 million catties of silage accumulated in recent years, totaling 11.02 million catties. This still leaves a shortage of more than 4 million catties, which needs to be solved through silage. Through accounting, the broad masses have a deep understanding of vigorously developing silage, so more than 3,000 laborers in the team actively collect wild grasses and vegetables in conjunction with summer hoeing; the elderly and children also actively act, and a mass movement quickly formed.

    II. Strengthen technical guidance and emphasize the quality of silage. Experience over the years has proven that although silage is not a mysterious matter, it is also very technical. If the cellar site is improper, the compaction is not solid, the air is not exhausted, and the moisture is not suitable, it is also easy to rot. In this regard, they strengthened technical guidance at the beginning of this year, trained silage technicians, and adopted the "three-fixed" responsibility system and the five-character operating procedures of "select, round, clean, solid, seal" in specific work. "Select" means that it is necessary to choose a higher ground to dig silage cellars to prevent water accumulation after rain; "round" means that the specifications are all round pits, with an area of: 6 *chi* in diameter, and the depth depends on the groundwater level. The deeper the water level, the deeper the pit, and the shallower the water level, the shallower the pit, but the shallowest shall not be less than 5 *chi*; "clean" means that when entering the cellar, wild grasses and vegetables with mud and dew must be washed, dried, and then put into the cellar to prevent deterioration and rot; "solid" means that when entering the cellar, a layer should be sprinkled and a layer should be compacted, sprinkled evenly, and compacted firmly (stalks should be chopped), and the air must be exhausted; "seal" means that after the wild grasses and vegetables enter the cellar, they must be sealed with soil and covered tightly. When sealing the soil, it should be about one *chi* higher than the ground, and cracks should be checked and soil added frequently to ensure that it is higher than the ground and free of cracks and loopholes to prevent water ingress and air penetration. In order to achieve the above requirements, 147 technicians were first trained. After practical teaching and learning, they specifically learned the methods. The production team secretary and captain contracted pieces, promoted a strict acceptance system, and implemented a three-fixed responsibility system of fixed leadership, fixed personnel management, and fixed management measures to ensure that each team has guidance, each cellar has dedicated personnel management, clear responsibilities, and implemented measures. After the above work, the quality of silage has been greatly improved. From the inspection and appraisal of the 137 silage cellars that have been completed so far, they can be stored for two or three years, or even five or six years.

    III. Comprehensive arrangement and multi-faceted combination. While arranging agricultural production, combine it with arranging silage work. Experience has proven that this is an important link in promoting grain and livestock in a coordinated manner and promoting each other. Based on the characteristics of this year's drought in the previous period and little grass, most of the labor was concentrated on drought resistance; in the later period, the management of spring and summer seedlings was concentrated, and there was a shortage of labor and animal power, and the silage task was heavy. It was fully realized that the task could not be completed by only a few people in the professional team. Therefore, a method combining a vigorous mass movement and a professional team was adopted. Each small team fixed three to five people to form a professional grass-cutting and silage team. The whole team fixed more than 200 laborers, forming 35 professional teams. These people are responsible for big projects in their spare time, small projects during busy times, and shock work during peak seasons all year round. The members of the commune, based on the spirit of self-storage, self-feeding, and striving for a surplus, were assigned tasks to each household, requiring each household to ensile 1,000 to 1,500 catties (some are stored separately, and some households store a cellar together). In order to facilitate the members of the commune and solve the current problems of insufficient labor and animal power during the busy farming season, and the difficulty of transportation, methods of setting up points in sections for on-site storage and the members of the commune taking baskets to the fields and bringing grass home were adopted. Since the beginning of summer, the members of the commune have collected 740,000 catties of wild grasses and vegetables in conjunction with weeding, thinning seedlings, and repairing melon vines.

    IV. Clear remuneration and reasonable work point recording. Reasonably stipulating work points, more work more pay, and extra rewards is an important experience in doing a good job in silage work in the past few years. It is stipulated that 15 catties of green grass and cotton leaves are recorded as one work point, 20 catties of hemp leaves are recorded as one work point, 30 catties of melon vines are recorded as one work point, and 7 catties of tree leaves are recorded as one work point. The allocation of tasks is: male full laborers ensile 1,600 catties per month, male half laborers and female full laborers ensile 1,200 catties per month, and female half laborers ensile 1,000 catties per month. The excess part, in addition to recording work points as stipulated, is also additionally rewarded with 80% of the work points. Students get cash for pulling grass during their spare time and holidays. The whole team uniformly stipulates that weeds are 5 *li* per catty, and *ququ* vegetables and bitter vegetables are 1 *fen* per catty. Due to reasonable quotas and clear tasks, the members of the commune actively used the time to go to the fields early and return home late, and the time between farm work to engage in large-scale vegetable collection activities. According to statistics, the average household in the whole team has collected more than 700 catties, and the more has collected more than 2,000 catties. More than 300 students from Yelinzhuang Elementary School used their spare time to cut more than 42,000 catties of grass in just one month, earning more than 800 yuan, which solved the students' book fees and tuition fees for June.

    野林庄生产队青贮饲料经验
    中共吴桥县委办公室
    河北省吴桥县王瞳公社野林庄生产队，为了迅速发展养猪事业，抓住夏季杂草丛生的大好时机，积极发动广大群众采打野草野菜，大搞青贮饲料。截至7月15日，全队已采打野草野菜一百五十多万斤，除保证了当前四千零四十头猪的食用外，还青贮了九十六万斤。
    野林庄生产队在大搞青贮饲料运动中，主要采取了政治挂帅、思想领先、细致总结近几年来青贮饲料的技术经验，全面安排劳力，合理报酬等具体措施。
    一、坚持政治挂帅，层层统一思想，是历年来大搞青贮饲料的首要关键。特别是今年，由于前段天旱，多数劳力集中抗旱；后段春、夏作物管理挤在一起，不仅农活多，而且劳力不足。因此，开始有些干部和群众便认为“今年搞青贮没条件”；个别的还怕搞青贮“耽误生产”等等。针对以上情况，总支委员会便发动群众总结近几年来大搞青贮的好处和经验。经过总结，人们一致认识到大搞青贮是保证猪只迅速发展的关键。近几年来，由于大搞青贮饲料，满足了养猪的需要，促进了养猪事业的大发展。1956年全队只有八百六十三头猪，现在已发展到四千零四十头，每户平均两头半。青贮饲料不仅原料来源广，而且成本低。生产队用工分和现款两种办法换取社员采打的野草野菜，也可以解决社员零花钱的问题。在统一思想的基础上，总支委员会又根据今年的猪只发展情况算了饲料需要账。全队计划到年底发展猪一万头，共需饲料一千五百多万斤，饲料地、闲散地可产三百万斤，玉米核、山芋蔓、棉花壳等副产品可收入七百万斤，再加上近几年来积存的青贮饲料一百零二万斤，共计一千一百零二万斤，这样还缺四百多万斤，需要青贮解决。通过算账，使广大群众对大搞青贮饲料有了深刻的认识，因此全队有三千多名劳力结合夏锄，积极采打野草野菜；老人、儿童也积极行动起来，很快形成了群众运动。
    二、加强技术指导，强调青贮质量。历年经验证明，搞青贮虽然不是什么神秘的事情，但技术性也很强。如果一旦窖址不当，踩压不实，空气排不净，水分不适合，也很容易发生霉烂。对此，他们今年一开始，就加强了技术指导，培训了青贮技术人员，在具体工作中采取了“三定”责任制和“选、圆、净、实、封”五字操作规程。“选”就是一定要选择地势较高的地方挖青贮窖，以防雨后存水；“圆”即在规格上一律是圆坑，面积：直径六市尺，深度视地下水位而定，水深坑也深，水浅坑也浅，但是最浅也不得浅于五市尺；“净”就是入窖时，对带有泥巴和露水的野草野菜一定要洗净晾干再入窖，以防变质霉烂；“实”是入窖时要撒一层踩一层，撒均匀，踩结实（秸秆要切碎），一定要排净空气；“封”即是野草野菜入窖后，要用土封好盖严。封土时，要比地面高出一尺左右，并且经常检查裂缝和添土，一定要保持高于地平面和无裂缝无漏洞，严防进水和透空气。为了达到上述要求，首先培训了一百四十七名技术员，经过实教实学，具体学会了作法。生产队支书、队长分片包干，推行了严格的验收制度和定领导、定专人管理、定管理措施的三定责任制，作到队队有指导，窖窖有专人管理，责任明确，措施落实。经过以上工作，青贮质量大大提高，从目前已搞好的一百三十七个青贮窖检查鉴定，都可以存放二、三年，甚至五、六年。
    三、全面安排，多面结合。在安排农业生产的同时，结合安排青贮工作。经验证明，这是粮畜并举、相互促进的重要一环。根据今年前段天旱草少，多数劳力集中抗旱；后段春、夏苗管理集中和劳、畜力不足，青贮任务大的特点，充分认识到只靠专业队几个人是不能完成任务的，因此，采取了大搞群众运动和专业队相结合的办法。每小队都固定了三至五人的打草青贮专业队，全队共固定了二百多名劳力，组成了三十五个专业队。这些人，大忙小搞，小忙大搞，旺季突击，常年负责。对社员个人本着自贮自喂、力争有余的精神，逐户分配了任务，要求每户青贮一千到一千五百斤（有的单贮，有的几户合贮一窖）。为了便利社员和解决当前农忙劳力畜力不足，运输有困难等问题，采取分片设点就地贮存和社员下地带筐，回家捎草的方法。入夏以来，社员们结合锄草、间定苗、修理瓜秧等农活，就采打野草野菜七十四万斤。
    四、明确报酬，合理记工。合理规定工分，多劳多得，超额奖励，这是过去几年来搞好青贮工作的一条重要经验。规定青草、棉叶十五斤记工一分、麻叶二十斤记工一分、瓜秧三十斤记工一分、树叶七斤记工一分。任务的分配是：男整劳力每月打贮一千六百斤，男半劳力和女整劳力每月打贮一千二百斤，女半劳力每月打贮一千斤。超额部分，除按规定记工外，并另外奖励80％的工分。学生课余和假日拔草给现款。全队统一规定杂草每斤五厘，曲曲菜、苦菜每斤一分钱。由于定额合理，任务明确，社员们都积极利用早下地晚回家和农活间歇时间大搞采菜活动，据统计，现在全队一般户都采集到七百多斤，多者二千多斤。野林庄完小三百多名学生，只一个月的时间就利用课余时间打草四万二千多斤，得款八百多元，解决了学生书费和6月份的学费。
