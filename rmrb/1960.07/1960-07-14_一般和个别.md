　　General and Individual
　　Liu Feng
　　We traveled over mountains and ridges all the way to Tianfu Coal Mine. By the time we found the Party Committee, it was almost noon. Upon inquiring at the Party Committee, we learned that the Party Secretary and the Propaganda Minister were both away, having gone deep into the front line to the Fourth Mine of Daijiagou. Daijiagou Fourth Mine—the name sounded so familiar; hadn't we just come from there? So we immediately returned to Daijiagou with the comrades from the mine.
　　On the way to Daijiagou, the comrade from the company told us a lot about the knowledge and situation of the coal mine. The Party Secretary is a northerner who has been here for several years. He has traveled all four mines of the company. Now he is in the Fourth Mine, working above and below ground all day long, rarely leaving. They have adopted the approach of going deep into one point to promote overall progress, combining points and surface, and using a point to lead the surface to solve problems in actual work. It is said that although the Secretary is in the Fourth Mine, he has not relaxed his work in the other mines; on the contrary, with the guiding experience from the key point, his leadership has become stronger. This is exactly what Chairman Mao has long told us: "Any leading person who does not obtain concrete experience from individual units, individual personnel, or individual events at the lower level will not be able to give universal guidance to all units."
　　Of course, leaders cannot do everything themselves; going deep into one point means dissecting a sparrow. After the leaders go deep into one point, they naturally cannot be satisfied with understanding the situation of the "point" and neglect understanding the situation of the "surface." When leading comrades go deep into one point, this mine becomes the command headquarters, and advanced experiences in production technology and leadership work can quickly blossom and bear fruit from here. Going deep into one point, breaking through one point, yields many direct experiences and concrete "models" for solving problems, which greatly strengthens the leadership of other units and enriches the content of overall leadership. Leading comrades can also adopt the method of going deep into one point to help weaker units improve their backward conditions. After directly gaining experience in transforming backwardness by going deep into a backward production unit, they can strengthen the leadership of other backward production units, draw inferences from one instance, and make practical and beneficial suggestions for the entire work.
　　What principle can we see from here? That is the dialectical relationship between the individual and the general. The general is composed of the individual. Without the individual, there is no general. This process of combining the general and the individual is also the repeated process of combining leaders and the masses, "from the masses, to the masses." Therefore, we say that only by going deep into the individual can we better guide the general. Only by going deep into one point and creating experience can we better guide the overall situation.
　　The approach of the Party Secretary of Tianfu Coal Mine is precisely like this. Our broad masses of cadres going deep into the front line and settling down are precisely to explore this correct working method.

　　一般和个别
　　刘丰
    我们一路翻山越岭，来到天府煤矿。等我们找到党委会的时候，快是中午时分了。到党委会一打听才知道党委书记和宣传部长都不在家，深入第一线到戴家沟的第四矿井去了。戴家沟第四井，好熟悉的名子啊，我们不是刚从那儿来的嘛？于是我们立即就随同矿上的同志又赶回戴家沟。
    在去戴家沟的路上，公司的那位同志和我们谈了不少关于煤矿的知识和情况。党委书记是个北方人，到这里已经好几年了，他走遍了公司的四个矿井，现在他在第四井，一天到晚井上井下，很少离开。他们采取了深入一点，推动全面，点面结合，以点带面，到实际工作中去解决问题。据说书记虽然在四井，但对于其他几个井的工作，不但没有放松，反而因为有了重点经验作指导，领导更加强了。这正是毛主席早就告诉我们的：“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导。”
    自然，领导者不能事事躬亲，深入一点也就是解剖一个麻雀。领导深入一点之后，自然不能满足于了解
  “点”的情况，而忽视了“面”的情况的了解。领导同志深入一点，这个井于是就成了指挥部，生产技术和领导工作中的先进经验，从这里可以迅速地开花结果。深入一点，突破一点，就取得了许多解决问题的直接经验和具体的“样板”，这就大大加强了对于其他单位的领导，充实了全面领导的内容。领导同志重点地帮助较差的单位，改变落后面貌，也可以采用深入一点的办法。深入一个落后生产单位，直接取得了改造落后的经验之后，就可以加强对于其他落后生产单位的领导，而且可以举一反三，由此及彼，对整个工作提出各种切合实际而又有益的意见。
    从这里可以看到一个什么道理呢？那就是个别和一般的辩证关系，一般正是由个别所组成的，离开了个别，也就无所谓一般。这种一般和个别相结合的过程，也就是领导和群众相结合，“从群众中来，到群众中去”的反复的过程。所以我们说：只有深入个别，才能更好地指导一般。只有深入一点，创造经验，才能更好地指导全面。
    天府煤矿党委书记的做法就是这样的。我们广大干部深入第一线落户，也正是为了探求这个正确的工作方法。
