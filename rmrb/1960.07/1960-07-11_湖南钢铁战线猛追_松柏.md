　　Hunan Steel Front Eagerly Chases "Songbai"
　　The furnace opening rate of 100 iron plants in the province increased by about 10% compared with March. The daily output level and product quality of more than 95% of the iron plants continued to increase and improve.
    Changsha, July 10th (By this newspaper) - The mass movement of "learning from Songbai and catching up with Songbai" is widely carried out on the steel front in Hunan Province, which effectively promoted the pig iron production in the province. At present, the furnace opening rate of 100 iron plants in the province has increased by about 10% compared with March; the daily output level and product quality of pig iron in more than 95% of the iron plants have continued to increase and improve.
    Songbai Iron Plant is a small indigenous iron plant in Changning County, which was established from scratch during the Great Leap Forward for steel production in 1958. After more than a year of technological transformation, the furnace opening rate of the plant is often maintained at 89.3%, the utilization coefficient is gradually increased; the pig iron qualification rate is increased to more than 95%, the average coke ratio is 0.86, the cost per ton of iron is reduced to 84.8 yuan, and the labor required for smelting one ton of iron is reduced from an average of 11 people at the end of last year to 3.68 people. As of the beginning of June, it has completed 59.7% of this year's national plan. In recent months, this iron plant has been a red flag on the steel front in Hunan Province.
    The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the achievements and experiences of the Songbai Iron Plant, believing that its achievements demonstrate the strong vitality of small indigenous iron plants, and point out the specific path for high quality, high yield, and continuous leap forward of small blast furnaces. Therefore, it calls on all iron plants in the province to "learn from Songbai and catch up with Songbai". In April of this year, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting at the Songbai Iron Plant. Zhang Pinghua, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, summarized the experience of this iron plant into three points, namely, adhering to the Party's general line, adhering to the mass line, and adhering to continuous revolution.
    After this red flag was erected in the province, all iron plants in the province formulated specific plans to learn from and catch up with "Songbai". More than 500 people have successively gone to the Songbai Iron Plant to study and learn from their experiences. The Chen County Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized all iron plants in the special zone to learn from and catch up with the Songbai Iron Plant; organized the Party committee secretaries, plant directors, and technicians of each iron plant to visit "Songbai"; each plant, led by the Party committee secretary, established a combat headquarters for "learning from and catching up with Songbai". Guo Yi, the secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and the director of the Industrial Office of the Prefectural Committee led the bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and technicians to form four working groups, which went to key iron plants to carry out three experimental furnaces; industrial secretaries and heads of industrial and transportation departments of various counties carried out six experimental furnaces; leading cadres of various iron plants also generally carried out experimental furnaces, and 90% of the cadres went deep into the teams and groups to sit and break through the difficulties. For example, the Liyu River Iron Plant in Chen County humbly learned from the experience of the Songbai Iron Plant, leading cadres moved to the front of the furnace to work, followed the shifts to work, commanded the battle, and promptly solved the key problems in the promotion of advanced experience, so that the daily output of pig iron rose sharply, from 40.55 tons in March to 45 tons in April and 65 tons in May. The employees of Huangyangsi Iron Plant in Lingling County, Hengyang Special Zone, thoroughly broke the theory of solely relying on conditions and the theory that production had reached its peak, put forward the fighting slogan of "the locomotive boiler must surpass the electric motor", carried out a great revolution on the locomotive boiler, and doubled the efficiency, which greatly improved the utilization coefficient of the whole plant. Under the impetus of learning from and catching up with Songbai, many iron plants have successfully promoted the experience of using white briquettes to make iron, which greatly saved raw materials such as coking coal. The Songbai Iron Plant has continued to play a leading role. Since the on-site meeting in April, there have been new developments in all aspects. Since mid-June, the furnace opening rate of the plant has reached 100%, and the daily output level has increased by more than 60% compared with May. The plant has basically completed the technical transformation and maintenance of the main equipment. The in-plant transportation has realized the "one-dragon" system, and the transportation efficiency has been greatly improved. Now, the whole plant is advancing towards the comprehensive utilization of five ashes (gas duct ash, dust removal gas ash, waste gas duct ash, boiler ash, hot blast stove ash), three powders (ore powder, coke powder, limestone powder ash), one slag (furnace slag), and one water (furnace-side water). The workers are determined to complete the annual production plan one quarter ahead of schedule.

### 湖南钢铁战线猛追“松柏”

　　湖南钢铁战线猛追“松柏”
　　全省一百个铁厂开炉率比三月份提高百分之十左右，百分之九十五以上的铁厂日产水平和产品质量持续增长和提高
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省钢铁战线广泛开展“学松柏、赶松柏”的群众  运动，有效地促进了全省生铁生产。现在全省一百个铁厂开炉率比3月份提高10％左右；95％以上的铁厂生铁日产水平和产品质量都持续增长和提高。
    松柏铁厂是常宁县的一个小洋群铁厂，是1958年大炼钢铁时白手起家办起来的。经过一年多来的技术改造，现在全厂开炉率经常保持在89.3％，利用系数逐步提高；生铁合格率提高到95％以上，平均焦比为零点八六，每吨铁的成本下降到八十四点八元，每炼一吨铁所用的劳力，由去年底平均十一人减少为三点六八人。至6月上旬止，已完成今年国家计划59.7％。几个月来，这个铁厂一直是湖南省钢铁战线上的一面红旗。
    中共湖南省委对松柏铁厂所取得的成绩和经验十分重视，认为它的成就显示了钢铁小洋群的旺盛生命力，指出了小高炉优质、高产、持续跃进的具体道路，因此号召全省各钢铁厂
  “学松柏，赶松柏”。今年4月，省委又在松柏铁厂召开了现场会议。省委第一书记张平化同志把这个铁厂的经验总结为三条，就是坚持党的总路线，坚持群众路线，坚持不断革命。
    这面红旗在全省树立起来以后，全省各铁厂都订出了学赶“松柏”的具体规划，先后有五百多人到松柏铁厂学习取经。中共郴县地委动员全专区各铁厂学赶松柏铁厂；组织各铁厂党委书记、厂长和技术人员到“松柏”参观；各厂由党委书记挂帅，成立
  “学赶松柏”的战斗指挥部。以地委书记郭毅和地委工业办公室主任为首，带领局长、科长、技术人员，组成四个工作组，分赴重点铁厂搞了三个试验炉；各县工业书记和工交部长等搞了六个试验炉；各铁厂领导干部也普遍搞了试验炉，90％的干部深入班组，坐镇破关。如郴县鲤鱼江铁厂虚心学习松柏铁厂的经验，领导干部搬到炉前办公，跟班劳动，指挥战斗，及时解决了推广先进经验中出现的关键问题，使生铁日产量直线上升，3月份日产四十点五五吨，4月份达四十五吨，5月份为六十五吨。衡阳专区零陵县黄阳司铁厂职工，大破唯条件论和生产到顶论，提出“锅驼机要赛过电动机”的战斗口号，对锅驼机进行大革命，提高效率一倍，使全厂利用系数大大提高。许多铁厂在学赶松柏的推动下，已成功地推行了白煤球炼铁的经验。大大节约了焦煤等原料。松柏铁厂继续发挥了带头作用。自4月现场会以来，各方面又有了新的发展。6月中旬起，全厂开炉率已达到100％，日产水平比5月份增长60％以上。全厂基本上完成了主要设备的技术改造和检修。厂内运输实现了“一条龙”，运输效率大大提高。现在，全厂正向综合利用五灰、
  （煤气道灰、除尘气灰、废气道灰、锅炉灰、热风炉灰）、三粉（矿粉、焦粉、石灰石粉灰）、一渣（炉渣）、一水（炉边水）进军，职工们决心提前一季完成全年生产计划。
