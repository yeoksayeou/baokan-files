Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, July 12th: Congolese soldiers and civilians, in order to defend the independence and unity of the Congo, are continuing to take up arms and heroically resist the aggression of the Belgian army. The government of the Republic of the Congo issued a public statement strongly condemning the traitorous acts of the Katanga Province authorities in attempting to introduce British interventionist troops.

It is reported that on July 11, a few miles from Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, Congolese soldiers heroically resisted Belgian paratroopers who were suppressing them with armed force. In the Sinkolobwe uranium mining area near Jadotville, Katanga Province, Congolese troops fought armed Belgian colonialists and surrounded these provocative colonialists, ordering them to lay down their weapons.

In Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, Congolese soldiers and civilians have also joined the recent anti-colonialist struggle. It is reported that Congolese soldiers there disarmed their Belgian officers on the evening of July 10 and replaced them with African officers of their own choosing. Reports say that Congolese soldiers there also stormed and briefly controlled the airport occupied by the colonialists and occupied a town near the airport.

According to reports, Africans from the suburbs of Stanleyville poured into the city to assist the army in collecting weapons from the colonialists. Reports say that about five hundred African residents surrounded a four-story building occupied by colonialists in the city center.

In the Matadi area of Lower Congo, Congolese troops shot down a Belgian plane. At the port of Matadi, Congolese soldiers are still fighting Belgian troops. Other reports say that railway traffic between the Congolese capital, Leopoldville, and the Rhodesian border has been cut off.

In Leopoldville, following a strike by postal and telecommunications workers on July 10, African workers at Belgian airlines also went on strike on the morning of July 11, demanding that Africans take over the administrative duties of local companies and that they receive family and housing allowances.

On the same day, the government of the Republic of the Congo issued a public statement regarding the request by the authorities of the Congolese Katanga Province, supported by the colonialists, for the Rhodesian British colonial authorities to send troops to intervene in the Congo, strongly condemning this act of treason by the Katanga Province authorities. The statement said, "The (Congolese) Central Government believes that, according to the fundamental law, no provincial government has the right to request troops belonging to a foreign country to enter the sovereign state of the Congo." The statement emphasized, "The (Central) Government once again specifically points out that its basic intention is to obtain respect for legitimate rights and to defend the integrity of the national territory."

Reports say that the Congolese government has expelled three Belgian colonialists who seriously endangered the national security of the Congo, including Van Hek, the former district chief of Leopoldville.

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, July 11th: Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens revealed in a speech to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives today that the Belgian government is colluding with colonial countries such as the United States and Britain to intensify the military suppression of the Congolese people.

In a special meeting of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives to debate the situation in the Congo, Eyskens said that the Belgian government would "take all necessary measures" to protect Belgian and "free world" interests in the Congo. He slandered the Congolese government as "no longer possessing the indispensable means to ensure the safety of life and property which they used to employ."

Eyskens also said: "The enormous task facing us cannot be achieved without the help of our allies and international organizations." He said: "Belgium's request for assistance has been made."

Eyskens had to admit that "the independence of the Congo is a recognized fact," but he then referred to the "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation" temporarily signed between the Belgian government and the Congolese government, attempting to force the Congolese government to "request" Belgian troops to carry out suppression under the provisions of this treaty. He said that the Belgian government believes that this treaty "should include the basis for future cooperation between the two countries." At the same time, Eyskens also recounted the various actions taken by the Belgian army that had already violated Congolese territory and trampled on Congolese sovereignty. These actions show that the Belgian army had already taken bloody suppression measures against the Congolese people's patriotic and just actions without being "requested" by the Congolese government.

The Chamber of Representatives, controlled by the ruling Belgian Catholic Social Party, finally passed a resolution agreeing to the government's policy of suppressing the Congo; the Belgian Communist Party voted against it.

Xinhua News Agency, July 12th, Elisabethville Dispatch: The imperialists, headed by the United States, on the one hand, are using the Belgian government to send troops to suppress the anti-colonialist patriotic struggle launched by the Congolese soldiers and civilians, and on the other hand, are actively plotting to divide Congolese territory and undermine the independence and sovereignty of the Congo. According to reports, under the instigation and authorization of the imperialists, Tshombe, the chairman of the Conakat Party, which represents the interests of foreign colonialists in Katanga Province, Congo, announced on the evening of the 11th that Katanga Province was seceding from the Republic of the Congo and "independent," and announced that he had "appointed" a Belgian officer of the Belgian invading forces as "commander" of the Katanga military police. At the same time, he also requested Belgium to send more troops to Katanga to suppress the Congolese people and maintain the ruling position of his party there. This party was created and supported last year by the Katanga Union Mining Company, composed of monopoly capital from the United States, Belgium, and Britain, in order to undermine the independence and unity of the Congo. This mining company not only monopolizes the mining rights of the rich mineral deposits in Katanga Province but also controls the economic lifeline of the Congo.

　　保卫祖国独立　反对殖民镇压
　　刚果军民英勇抗击比利时侵略军
　　比殖民者在美英支持下一面加紧镇压一面图谋分裂刚果领土
    新华社12日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民为了保卫刚果的独立和统一，正继续拿起武器英勇地抗击比利时军队的侵略。刚果共和国政府发表公报强烈谴责加丹加省当局企图引进英国干涉军的卖国勾当。
    据报道，11日，在距离加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔几英里的地方，刚果士兵英勇抗击武装镇压他们的比利时伞兵。在加丹加省贾多特维尔附近的铀矿区辛科洛布韦，刚果军队曾同武装的比利时殖民者进行战斗，并且包围了这些挑衅的殖民者。并且命令他们放下武器。
    在东方省首府斯坦利维尔，刚果军民也投入了最近的反殖民主义的斗争。据报道，那里的刚果士兵10日晚解除了统治他们的比籍军官的武装，并且由自己选出来的非洲军官接替了他们的职务。消息说，那里的刚果士兵还攻进并一度控制了殖民者霸占的机场，并且占领了机场附近的一个市镇。
    据报道，斯坦利维尔郊区的非洲人涌入市区协助军队收缴殖民者的武器。消息说，约有五百名非洲居民包围了殖民者在市中心的一座四层楼房。
    在下刚果的马塔迪地区，刚果军队曾经打下了一架比利时飞机。在马塔迪港，刚果士兵仍在同比利时军队进行战斗中。另有消息说，刚果首都利奥波德维尔通往罗得西亚边境的铁路交通已被切断。
    在利奥波德维尔，继邮电工人10日举行罢工之后，比利时航空公司的非洲工人11日上午也举行了罢工，要求由非洲人接管当地公司的行政职务，并且要求获得家庭和住房的补助金。
    同一天，刚果共和国政府就殖民者支持下的刚果加丹加省当局要求罗得西亚英国殖民当局出兵刚果干涉一事发表公报，强烈谴责加丹加省当局的这种卖国行为。公报说，
  “（刚果）中央政府觉得，根据根本法的规定，不管怎样，任何省政府都没有权利要求属于外国的军队进入有主权的国家刚果”。公报强调说，“（中央）政府再一次特别指出它的基本意图是获得合法权利的尊重和保卫国家领土的完整。”
    有消息说，刚果政府已把严重危害刚果国家安全的三名比利时殖民者驱逐出境，其中包括前利奥波德维尔区区长范核克。
    新华社布鲁塞尔11日电　比利时首相伊斯更斯今天在比利时众议院的发言中透露，比利时政府正在勾结美国和英国等殖民国家加紧对刚果人民的军事镇压。
    伊斯更斯在比利时众议院辩论刚果局势的特别会议上说，比利时政府要“采取一切必要措施”来保护比利时和“自由世界”在刚果的利益。他诬蔑刚果政府“已不再拥有由他们运用的确保生命和财产安全的不可缺少的手段”。
    伊斯更斯还说：“我们面临的巨大任务不可能在没有我们盟国和国际组织的帮助下实现”。他说：
  “比利时要求帮助的请求已经提出。”
    伊斯更斯不得不承认“刚果的独立是个公认的事实”，但是，他接着就提到了比利时政府和刚果政府临时签署了的两国“友好合作条约”，企图根据这项条约的规定，迫使刚果政府“要求”比利时军队进行镇压。他说，比利时政府认为，这项条约“应该包括两国今后合作的基础”。同时，伊斯更斯还追述了比利时军队已经采取的侵犯刚果领土、蹂躏刚果主权的种种行动，这些行动表明，比利时军队未经刚果政府“要求”，就已经对刚果人民的爱国正义行动采取血腥镇压措施。
    在比利时执政党天主教社会党控制下的众议院最后通过了同意政府镇压刚果政策的决议，比利时共产党投反对票。
    新华社12日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：以美国为首的帝国主义者一方面由比利时政府出兵镇压刚果军民掀起的反殖民主义爱国斗争，另方面积极图谋分割刚果领土、破坏刚果的独立主权。据报道，在帝国主义者的策动和授意下，在刚果加丹加省代表外国殖民利益的科纳卡特党的主席冲伯，11日晚宣布加丹加省脱离刚果共和国而“独立”，并且宣布已“任命”了比利时入侵部队的一位比利时军官为统率加丹加军警的“司令”，同时，他还要求比利时派更多的军队到加丹加镇压刚果人民和维持他的党在那里的统治地位。这个党是由美、比、英三国垄断资本组成的加丹加联合矿业公司为了破坏刚果独立和统一于去年一手制造和扶植起来的。这家矿业公司不仅垄断着加丹加省丰富的矿藏开采权，而且还控制着刚果经济命脉。
