Learning Advanced Truths by Crossing Mountains and Ridges
　　Cadres in Dianbai County Universally Promote the Good Style of Ye Yang
　　“Ye Yang-style” Party Members and Cadres Emerge in Large Numbers, Promoting Continuous Leaps in Production
　　(Our Dispatch) A “Learn from Ye Yang, Catch up with Ye Yang” movement, with the improvement of the working style of cadres as its central content, has been further deepened in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, the hometown of Comrade Ye Yang. Over the past month, the political and ideological level and working style of cadres in this county have been significantly improved. A large number of “Ye Yang-style” Party members and “Ye Yang-style” cadres have emerged. They adhere to eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, further strengthening the ties between cadres and the masses, and unleashing the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, which has powerfully promoted agricultural production.

　　Since the *Nanfang Daily* published the deeds of Comrade Ye Yang, secretary of the Party Branch of the Shishui Brigade in Dianbai County, who insisted on eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses for ten years on May 30, and the Chinese Communist Party Guangdong Provincial Committee issued a circular calling on cadres throughout the province to learn from Ye Yang, and after the *People's Daily* published a related editorial, cadres from leading cadres to grassroots cadres in Dianbai County, as well as the broad masses of commune members in urban and rural people's communes, have actively, consciously, and enthusiastically participated in the “Learn from Ye Yang, Catch up with Ye Yang” upsurge. Li Xiuying (female), a national agricultural labor model who has been to Beijing five times and honorably met with Chairman Mao four times, and is the deputy director of the Poxin Commune and secretary of the Party Branch of the “Red October” Brigade in Dianbai County, walked more than 100 *li* to visit Ye Yang and humbly learn from him the experience and working style of leading the development of agricultural production. Liu Huikang, a Guangdong Provincial agricultural labor model and deputy director of the Guanzhu Commune and captain of the Dabi Brigade in Dianbai County, also crossed more than 30 high mountains and ridges to visit the Shishui Brigade. After returning to the commune, Liu Huikang immediately moved his luggage to the backward Hekuaipo team, determined to help this team catch up with the advanced teams. In the movement to learn from Ye Yang, cadres in various localities have concretely linked the production and work situation in their regions, carried out criticism and self-criticism, praised good people and deeds, criticized incorrect ideological styles, promoted strengths, and overcome shortcomings, achieving simultaneous learning and improvement of working styles. The Xinbei Brigade, which is adjacent to the Shishui Brigade, originally had better natural conditions such as land and water conservancy than the Shishui Brigade, and was also an advanced team in the past, but its early rice production this year fell behind the Shishui Brigade, and their "first-class rice" was not as good as the Shishui Brigade's "third-class rice." In order to help cadres understand the reasons for their backwardness, the Party Branch of the Xinbei Brigade organized more than 80 cadres to visit the Shishui Brigade. After learning from the experience of the Shishui Brigade, these cadres seriously criticized their past floating style of not going deep into the masses, immediately picked up their hoes, carried manure baskets, and accumulated fertilizer together with the commune members, driving the commune members to engage in high-yield fields and high-yield areas for late rice. At present, this brigade has accumulated more than 500,000 *dan* of fertilizer in advance for late rice, striving for high yield and increased harvest of late rice. Currently, cadres at all levels throughout the county have gone to the front line of agricultural production, and most of the leading cadres have gone especially to backward brigades, adhering to eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses. In the process of going deep into production and leading production, leading cadres at all levels have universally helped the grassroots to comprehensively adjust the labor organization, concentrating the main labor force into agricultural production, especially grain production; at the same time, they have tried every possible means to expand the planting area of late rice. The planting area of late rice in the county this year will be expanded by 120,000 *mu* compared with last year.

　　Through learning from Ye Yang, the broad masses of cadres have further realized the significance of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other, criticized the past erroneous practices of some people who only grasped production but not life, strengthened the leadership of public canteens, and comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members. In order to run the public canteens of the people's communes well, the broad masses of cadres regularly go to the canteens as cooks to help the canteens solve various specific problems. Driven by the cadres, the public canteens throughout the county have now planted more than 24,000 *mu* of vegetables, and raised more than 21,000 pigs and more than 170,000 poultry, and more than 4,000 *mu* of pond fish. The public canteens are getting better and better, which has further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses. The commune members of the Musu Brigade of the Xiaoliang Commune posted more than 200 big-character posters, praising the cadres for caring about the lives of the masses, and expressing their determination to do a good job in late rice production. In just over 20 days, the entire brigade reclaimed 420 *mu* of wasteland, and expanded and interplanted more than 1,900 *mu* of miscellaneous grains.

    翻山越岭学先进取真经
    电白县干部遍兴叶养好作风
    “叶养式”党员和干部大批涌现，促进生产不断跃进
    本报讯　一个以改进干部工作作风为中心内容的“学叶养、赶叶养”运动，已经在叶养同志的家乡——广东省电白县进一步深入开展。一个多月来，这个县干部的政治思想水平和工作作风都有显著进步，“叶养式”党员、“叶养式”干部大批出现，他们坚持和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，进一步密切了干部同群众的联系，发挥了广大群众的生产积极性和创造性，有力地促进了农业生产。
    自从5月30日“南方日报”发表了电白县湿水大队党总支书记叶养同志十年如一日地坚持和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量的事迹，和中共广东省委号召全省干部学习叶养的批语，以及“人民日报”发表了有关的社论以后，电白县从领导干部到基层干部，以至城乡人民公社的广大社员群众，都积极地自觉地踊跃投入“学叶养、赶叶养”的热潮。曾经五次上北京、四次光荣会见毛主席的全国农业劳动模范、电白县坡心公社副社长兼“红十月”大队党总支书记李秀英（女）走一百多里路登门拜访叶养，虚心地向他学习领导发展农业生产的经验和工作作风。广东省农业劳动模范、电白县观珠公社副社长兼大陂大队队长刘惠康，也越过三十多个高山大岭，到湿水大队参观访问。回社后，刘惠康立即把行李搬到后进的禾块坡小队住下，决心帮助这个队赶上先进队。在学习叶养运动中，各地干部都具体地联系自己地区的生产、工作情况，开展批评与自我批评，表扬好人好事，批判不正确的思想作风，发扬优点克服缺点，做到边学习、边改进工作作风。和湿水大队毗邻的莘陂大队，原来的土地、水利等自然条件都比湿水大队好，过去又是先进队，但今年早造生产却落在湿水大队的后面，他们的“一类稻”还比不上湿水大队的“三类稻”。莘陂大队党总支为了帮助干部认识落后的原因，组织了八十多名干部到湿水大队参观访问。这些干部学习了湿水大队的经验以后，严肃地批判了过去不深入群众的漂浮作风，立即拿起锄头，挑着粪箕，和社员们一起积肥，带动社员们大搞晚造丰产田、丰产片。现在这个大队已提早为晚造积了五十多万担肥料，力争晚造粮食高产多收。目前，全县各级干部都到农业生产第一线，其中大部分领导干部并特别到后进大队，坚持和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量。各级领导干部在深入生产、领导生产的过程中，普遍帮助基层全面地调整了劳动组织，集中主要劳动力投入农业生产特别是粮食生产；同时千方百计地扩大晚造粮食种植面积。全县今年晚造种植面积将比去年扩大十二万亩。
    通过学习叶养，广大干部更进一步体会到一手抓生产、一手抓生活的意义，批判了过去有些人只抓生产、不抓生活的错误做法，加强了对公共食堂的领导，全面安排好社员生活。为了办好公社公共食堂，广大干部都定期到食堂当炊事员，帮助食堂解决各种具体问题。在干部的带动下，目前全县的公共食堂已种下二万四千多亩蔬菜，并且增养了二万一千多头猪和十七万多只家禽，四千多亩塘鱼。公共食堂越办越好，更加激励了群众的生产热情。小良公社木苏大队的社员贴了二百多张大字报，表扬干部关心群众生活，并表示决心搞好晚造生产。仅二十多天时间，全大队就开荒四百二十亩，并且扩种、间种杂粮一千九百多亩。
