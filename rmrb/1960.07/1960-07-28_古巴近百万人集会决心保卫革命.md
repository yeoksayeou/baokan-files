    Castro Says American Imperialism's Aggression Against Cuba Proves It is the Mortal Enemy of the Progress of All Peoples
    Lu Xuzhang, on Behalf of the Chinese People, Congratulates Cuba on its Great Revolutionary Victory and Supports the Just Struggle of the Cuban People
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th -- Cuban Prime Minister Castro said tonight at a rally of nearly a million people that the aggression against Cuba has finally exposed the mask of American imperialism and proved to the people of Latin America that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the progress and happiness of all peoples.
    Castro made these remarks at a rally of a million Cubans held in Las Mercedes in the Sierra Maestra Mountains to celebrate the July 26th Revolutionary Day. His speech was met with prolonged cheers as people chanted slogans such as "Cuba, yes, Yankees, no" and "We shall prevail."
    Castro emphasized that the Cuban people are willing to pay any price to achieve happiness, while powerful foreign interest groups are trying to prevent the Cuban people from moving forward.
    He said that the Cuban people will fight against them, no matter how powerful they are.
    Castro emphasized that nothing can prevent the Cuban people from defending their thriving new life and the bright hope for the future. This determination is decisive in the life of a nation.
    Castro said that in the past, when the country did not belong to the people, but to a handful of powerful companies, when it was full of crime and hunger, the American rulers armed the tyrant and trained armies to massacre the people for the tyrant. Now that the people have built a happy life, these American rulers are trying to strangle the people.
    Castro said that today, the Cuban militia is marching for the last time without modern weapons and without being fully armed. He announced that Cuba already has weapons to supply the national revolutionary militia.
    Castro finally called on the people to be vigilant and asked all those present to solemnly swear in the name of the comrades who sacrificed in the struggle: to redouble their efforts, increase production, build houses, schools, and hospitals faster, conduct militia training, and fight for literacy and constantly overcome their weaknesses.
    Workers, peasants, militiamen, soldiers of the rebel army, students, and women participating in the meeting, holding machetes and palm hats, waving scarves and handkerchiefs, solemnly swore to fulfill the revolutionary promises amid prolonged cheers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th -- Nearly a million men and women from all over the country, including workers, farmers, student militias, and people from all walks of life, gathered in the Sierra Maestra Mountains this morning to participate in a massive people's rally to condemn American imperialism's aggression against Cuba and to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the Cuban rebels' attack on the Moncada Barracks.
    The conference began with a parade of armed militias. The conference was presided over by President Dorticos, Prime Minister Castro, cabinet members, leaders and officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and leaders of various people's organizations. Hundreds of young representatives from Latin American countries, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States participating in the First Latin American Youth Congress also participated in the conference. The First Latin American Youth Congress also used this massive rally as its opening ceremony, with the participating representatives bringing support from the people of all countries in the world. Also attending the conference were the Chinese trade delegation headed by Lu Xuzhang, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, former Guatemalan President Arbenz, and other invited foreign dignitaries.
    The Cuban flag fluttered over the vast fields, and eye-catching huge banners were written with revolutionary slogans: "Swear to defend the motherland" and "We will defeat the aggression of American imperialism." Colorful balloons floated in the air. The masses participating in the meeting continuously shouted the slogan "Cuba, yes, Yankees, no," demonstrating the unwavering will of the Cuban people to defend national independence.
    Many people who participated in the conference arrived in the Sierra Maestra Mountains a few days ago. Tens of thousands of people spent the night in the mountains, waiting for the arrival of this festival. They walked from one hill to another, shouting "Long live the revolution." A continuous stream of cars and people continued to arrive from highways and small roads, singing songs against American imperialism.
    In a television broadcast shortly before the start of the conference, Cuban Prime Minister Castro talked about the recently signed trade agreement between Cuba and China, saying, "This guarantees the opening of new markets and enables us to develop victoriously, free from the despicable actions of the US government attempting to hit our economy by reducing sugar quotas." Lu Xuzhang, the head of the Chinese trade delegation, said that the Chinese people congratulate the Cuban people on the great revolutionary victory they have achieved under the leadership of Prime Minister Castro. He said, "The victory of your revolution marks the beginning of the collapse of American imperialism's control over Latin America. Your victory belongs not only to the Cuban people, but also to all the Latin American people and all peace-loving people in the world." He also said that the Cuban people are not isolated in their struggle. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people, as well as the people of the world, stand with the Cuban people in their struggle against American imperialism. When Lu Xuzhang shouted in Spanish: "Cuba, yes, Yankees, no," and "Long live Cuba," the crowd responded with warm applause.
    Czechoslovak Ambassador to Cuba, Pavlicek, said on television that he conveyed the congratulations of the Czechoslovak people to Castro and the Cuban people. He pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Cuban people is just and is supported by the people of all countries in the world. Finally, he emphasized, "Cuba will win!"

    马埃斯特腊山区在革命节日响起反对美国侵略的雄壮吼声
    古巴近百万人集会决心保卫革命
    卡斯特罗说美帝国主义对古巴的侵略证明它是各国人民进步的死敌
    卢绪章代表中国人民祝贺古巴伟大革命胜利支持古巴人民正义斗争
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天晚上在近百万人的大会上说，对古巴的侵略最后揭穿了美帝国主义的假面具，并且在拉丁美洲各国人民面前证明，美帝国主义是各国人民的进步和幸福的死敌。
    卡斯特罗是在马埃斯特腊山区的拉斯梅塞德斯为庆祝7月26日革命节而举行的百万古巴人的大会上这样说的。他的讲话不断博得长时间的欢呼，人们高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”、“我们必胜”等口号。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴人民不惜任何代价，希望获得幸福；而强大的外国利益集团却在极力企图阻止古巴人民前进。
    他说，古巴人民将通过斗争来反对他们，不管他们是如何强大。
    卡斯特罗强调说，没有任何东西能够阻止古巴人民保卫欣欣向荣的新生活和未来的光辉希望。这种决心在一个国家的生活中是具有决定意义的。
    卡斯特罗说，过去，当国家不属于人民，而属于一小撮有势力的公司的时候，当这里充满了罪恶和饥饿的时候，美国执政者武装暴君，为暴君训练进行屠杀人民的军队。而现在，当人民建立了幸福生活的时候，这些美国执政者却企图扼杀人民。
    卡斯特罗说，今天，古巴民兵是最后一次在没有现代化武器、没有完全武装起来的情况下举行游行。他宣布，古巴已经有了供给全国革命民兵的武器了。
    卡斯特罗最后号召人民提高警惕，并且要求所有的到会者以在斗争中牺牲的同志的名义庄严地宣誓：加倍努力，增加生产，更快地建设住宅、学校、医院，进行民兵训练，为扫盲和不断地克服自己的弱点而斗争。
    参加大会的工人、农民、民兵、起义军士兵、学生和妇女高举砍刀和棕榈帽，挥动着头巾和手帕，在长时间的欢呼声中，庄严地宣誓履行革命的诺言。
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　近百万来自全国各地的工、农和学生民兵以及社会各阶层的男女人士今天早晨聚集在马埃斯特腊山区，参加声势浩大的人民集会，谴责美帝国主义对古巴的侵略，庆祝古巴起义者攻打蒙卡达军营的七周年。
    大会以武装民兵的游行开始。主持这次大会的有多尔蒂科斯总统、卡斯特罗总理、内阁成员以及革命武装部队的领导人和军官以及各人民组织的领袖。数以百计的拉丁美洲国家、亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美国参加拉丁美洲青年第一次代表大会的青年代表们也参加了这次大会。拉丁美洲青年第一次代表大会也是以今天这个声势浩大的集会作为开幕式的，与会的代表带来了世界各国人民的支援。出席这次大会的还有以对外贸易部副部长卢绪章为首的中国贸易代表团、前危地马拉总统阿本斯以及其他应邀的外国著名人士。
    古巴的国旗在辽阔的原野上飘扬着，引人注目的巨大的横幅标语上写着革命口号“誓死保卫祖国”、“我们将战胜美帝国主义的侵略”，五光十色的气球在空中飘荡。与会群众不断高呼着“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号，表明了古巴人民不可动摇的保卫民族独立的意志。
    许多参加大会的人在几天前就来到了马埃斯特腊山。成千上万的人在山中过夜，等待这个节日的来临。他们从一个山头走到另一个山头，高呼着“革命万岁”。川流不息的汽车和人群继续从公路和小路上到来，唱着反对美帝国主义的歌曲。
    在大会开始前不久的电视广播谈话中，古巴总理卡斯特罗谈到了最近签订的古巴和中国的贸易协定，他说，“这保证了开辟新市场和使我们能够胜利地发展，摆脱美国政府企图以减少食糖定额来打击我们经济的卑鄙行为。”中国贸易代表团团长卢绪章说，中国人民祝贺古巴人民在卡斯特罗总理领导下所取得的伟大的革命胜利。他说，“你们革命的胜利标志着美帝国主义对拉丁美洲控制垮台的开始。你们的胜利不仅属于古巴人民，而且也属于所有的拉丁美洲人民和全世界所有爱好和平的人民”。他还说，古巴人民在斗争中不是孤立的。六亿五千万中国人民以及全世界人民都同进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的古巴人民站在一起。当卢绪章用西班牙语高呼：“要古巴，不要美国佬”，“古巴万岁”时，群众报以热烈的掌声。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻古巴大使帕弗利切克在电视中说，他向卡斯特罗和古巴人民转达捷克斯洛伐克人民的祝贺。他指出，古巴人民的英勇斗争是正义的，它得到世界各国人民的支持。最后他强调指出，“古巴必胜！”
