What to Note After Concentrating Labor on the Production Frontline
Xiajiang County Greatly Emphasizes Labor Management, Work Efficiency Increases Exponentially
Jiangpu County Construction Commune Cadres Go Deep into Production to Help Teams Scientifically Manage Labor

Nanchang, July 20th (By Our Newspaper) — Xiajiang County, Jiangxi Province, after concentrating its main labor force in the fields, adopted various measures to manage and utilize every laborer well, ensuring the rapid and orderly development of the summer harvest and summer planting campaign.

During this year's summer harvest and summer planting, Xiajiang County newly added a labor force accounting for 23% of the total labor force. This newly added labor force did not have fixed labor organizations for a time, and their familiarity with production varied. Furthermore, the summer harvest and summer planting area increased by 40% compared to last year, and the maturity period was concentrated. Therefore, the organization and rational use of labor became a very prominent issue. With the significant increase in the labor force, a small number of cadres were blindly optimistic, and there were also instances of wasted labor. Therefore, the Xiajiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party vigorously grasped ideological work, labor management, and reasonable piecework wages, ensuring that labor organization was orderly, labor efficiency increased exponentially, and summer harvest and summer planting were both fast and good.

After the main labor force was successively concentrated on the agricultural front, Party committees at all levels organized cadres to carry out free airing of views and debates on the special topic of how to manage and utilize each laborer well, thereby raising everyone's awareness. Now, cadres at the county and commune levels go deep into the front line, eat, live, work, and consult with commune members, grasp ideological leadership, address weak links, and implement layered contracts to manage and utilize each laborer well.

Various localities, based on different objects of men, women, old, and young, the summer harvest and summer planting season, and agricultural projects, made reasonable divisions of labor according to the person, time, and place, so that each laborer could fully exert their role at different times and locations. Adapting to the person meant dividing labor based on age, physical strength, and skills. For example, the Baqiu Commune arranged young and middle-aged people to cut rice and thresh grain; old farmers had experience in intensive cultivation, so they were assigned to plow and harrow the fields; women were skilled and clever, so they were assigned to transplant rice and plant beans; and old women were careful in drying grain, ensuring that no grain was lost. In this way, everyone in the entire commune was able to demonstrate their abilities in their corresponding positions. Adapting to the time meant arranging labor based on the season, climate, and time. For example, before early rice was generally ripe, various localities arranged labor according to the principle of "planting first, harvesting later" for "rush planting" and "intercropping"; when early rice was generally ripe and entering the large-scale harvesting stage, various localities arranged labor according to the principle of "harvesting first, planting later," preventing grain loss due to failure to harvest in time. Adapting to the place meant allocating labor based on the distance of the fields, the difficulty of cultivation, and the quality of the soil.

After the rational division of labor, various localities also rationally matched strong and weak draft animals and old and new tools, so that each laborer had handy draft animals and tools. On this basis, various localities also interconnected the work types and the procedures within each work type, greatly improving the efficiency of summer harvest and summer planting.

Before the start of summer harvest and summer planting, various localities also formulated a "four-determination" temporary small-section contracting production responsibility system with "fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed labor, and fixed time." After the start of summer harvest and summer planting, they also formulated two sets of labor quotas for transplanting late rice based on the use of both old and new tools, in order to encourage commune members to use advanced tools and fully exploit the role of new tools. In addition, various localities gave timely commendations or material rewards to commune members who took the lead in working hard and exceeding quotas in summer harvest and summer planting, which greatly mobilized the labor enthusiasm of commune members.

Xinhua News Agency, — Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province Construction Commune, after concentrating more than 80% of its labor force into the agricultural production frontline, commune cadres specifically helped team cadres scientifically arrange and rationally use labor, so that every laborer could fully exert their strength.

Due to the expansion of the summer planting area, the increase in the multiple cropping index, and the corresponding increase in various yield-increasing measures, the labor input for autumn crops in the Construction Commune increased by 44% compared to last year. After concentrating 80% of the labor force to the production frontline, the commune Party committee adopted the following measures to help production teams manage labor well.

Commune cadres went deep into the production teams to help the team cadres learn to arrange and use labor according to the time, place, and person, based on the agricultural activities, the weight of the farm work, the difficulty of the technology, and the strength of the labor force. The Xihua team needed a total of 513 workdays for field management, while the 43 male and female full and half laborers invested in agricultural production in the whole team only had 430 workdays calculated over ten days, a difference of 83 workdays. At this time, Li Yunpu, deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, came to this team. While working with the commune members, he specifically clarified the various labor and agricultural work situations and helped the team cadres re-draw up a plan for using labor. For example, two half laborers with plowing skills were drawn out to free up two plowmen to engage in weeding; six livestock keepers were assigned to collect green grass for fertilizer while grazing cattle; and six plowmen were assigned to tidy up field ridges as an accompaniment. These items alone increased by 69 workdays in ten days. Therefore, the original ten-day production plan was completed in eight days, and a combination of work and rest was achieved.

The commune and team cadres of the Construction Commune, with a down-to-earth style, participated in production, took the lead in completing production quotas, and helped the production teams formulate production quotas based on different labor and agricultural work, establish a production responsibility system, and complete various production tasks in a timely manner. When the Yangliu Brigade was formulating a seven-day production plan for the summer planting sweep and autumn field management, the entire brigade was short of 350 workdays based on the production quotas proposed by the team. Therefore, some team cadres had a fear of difficulties, believing that completing the plan would not guarantee quality, and guaranteeing quality would have to slow down the progress. In order to further clarify the bottom line of various labor in completing production quotas, the branch secretary, brigade leader, deputy brigade leader, women's director, etc., went deep into the four production teams and weeded, hoed, and accumulated fertilizer with the commune members, greatly exceeding the original production quotas. The average person's daily weeding increased from 1.5 mu to 2.7 mu, hoeing increased from 0.7 mu to 1.3 mu, fertilizer accumulation increased from 600 jin to 800 jin, and late rice transplanting increased from 0.7 mu to 0.96 mu. After the brigade cadres overfulfilled the production quotas, they discovered that the past quotas were relatively low, and at the same time, they were completely clear about the production quotas and labor input for various agricultural tasks. On this basis, brigade cadres contracted areas and specifically helped the production teams formulate new production quotas for different labor, work types, and specifications and quality, and established a "five-determination" production responsibility system of fixed person, fixed agricultural work, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed work points. Due to the realistic production quotas, clear responsibilities, and rational use of labor, the entire brigade's seven-day production plan was completed in a timely manner.

The commune and team cadres of this commune often helped the production teams learn to grasp the primary and secondary aspects of production projects based on the specific circumstances of the time and place, and while concentrating the main labor to complete the main production projects, they completed general production projects. Lin Baode, secretary of the Huashan Brigade Party Branch, and Comrade Zhao Yulin of the county Party committee's work group, found that the 120 mu of mid-season rice in the Shanlin team had been weeded and needed fertilizer application urgently, but the team arranged 16 relatively strong laborers to engage in cotton field weeding and general agricultural work, while four women with weeding skills were doing household labor at home. After specific research with the team cadres, clarifying field management centered on fertilizer application, the team accumulated enough fertilizer for the mid-season rice in seven days, and also completed tasks such as cotton field weeding, wheat harvesting, and sweet potato planting.

    劳动力集中生产第一线后应注意什么问题
    峡江县大抓劳动管理工效成倍提高
    江浦县建设公社干部深入生产帮助小队科学管理劳力
    本报南昌20日电 江西峡江县把主要劳动力集中到田间后，采取各种措施管好用好每一个劳动力，保证了夏收夏种运动迅速地有秩序地开展。
    峡江县今年夏收夏种中新增援了占总劳力23％的劳动力，这批新添的劳力一时没有固定的劳动组织，生产的熟悉程度也各有不同，而夏收夏种面积比去年增加了40％，成熟期又集中，因此，劳动力的组织和合理使用就成为一个很突出的问题。劳动力大大增加，少数干部盲目乐观，也出现了浪费劳动力的现象。因此，中共峡江县委大抓思想工作，大抓劳动管理，大抓合理计酬，使劳动组织有条不紊，劳动效率成倍提高，夏收夏种既快又好。
    当主要劳动力陆续集中到农业战线上后，各级党委便以如何管好、用好每个劳动力为专题，组织干部开展鸣放辩论，提高了大家的认识。现在县、社各级干部都深入到第一线，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，抓思想领导、抓薄弱环节，层层包干，管好、用好每个劳动力。
    各地根据男女老少不同对象、夏收夏种季节和农事项目等，因人、因时、因地制宜，进行合理分工，使每个劳力在不同时间、不同地点都能充分发挥自己的作用。因人制宜，就是看年龄、看体力、看技能进行分工。如巴丘公社安排青壮年割禾、打谷；老农有精耕细作的经验，就分配他们耕田耙地；妇女们手巧心灵，就分配去插秧种豆；老婆婆晒谷细心，保证了颗粒不丢。这样全社人人都在与自己相应的岗位上大显神通。因时制宜，就是看季节、看气候、看时间安排劳力。例如在早稻还没有普遍成熟时，各地按先种后收的原则安排劳力，“抢插”“寄种”；在早稻普遍黄熟进入大割时，各地便按先收后种的原则安排劳力，防止了不能及时收割而造成脱粒浪费。因地制宜，就是看田地远近，看耕作难易、看土质好坏来分配劳力。
    在合理分工以后，各地又合理搭配强弱耕畜和新旧工具，使每个劳动力都有得心应手的耕畜和工具。在此基础上，各地又将工种与工种和每个工种中工序与工序互相衔接起来，使夏收夏种效率大为提高。
    各地在夏收夏种开始前，还制订了“定量、定质、定工、定时”的“四定”临时小段包工生产责任制。夏收夏种开始后，又根据使用新旧两项工具的情况，制订了两套插晚稻的劳动定额，以鼓励社员使用先进工具，充分发挥新工具作用。此外，各地对夏收夏种中带头干、超定额的社员，都及时分别给予了表扬或物质奖励，也大大调动了社员的劳动积极性。
    本报讯  江苏江浦县建设公社集中80％以上劳力投入农业生产第一线以后，公社干部具体帮助小队干部科学地安排和合理使用劳力，使每一个劳力都能充分发挥力量。
    建设公社由于夏种面积扩大、复种指数提高，各项增产措施相应加码，秋熟作物的用工量比去年增加44％。公社党委在把80％劳动力集中到生产第一线后，又采取以下几个办法帮助生产小队管好劳力。
    公社干部深入生产小队，帮助小队干部学会按农事活动、农活轻重、技术难易和劳力强弱等情况，因时、因地、因人制宜地安排和使用劳力。西华小队田间管理共需五百十三个工，而全小队投入农业生产的四十三名男女整半劳力，以十天计算，只有四百三十个工，相差八十三个工。就在这个时候，公社党委副书记李运普来到这个队，他在和社员一起劳动中，具体摸清了各种劳力和农活的情况，帮助小队干部重新订出了使用劳力的计划。例如抽出两个有耕田技术的半劳力腾换出两个耕田手搞耘耥，六个牧畜员一面放牛一面收集青草作肥料，六个耕田手附带整理田埂，单这几项十天内就增加了六十九个工。因此，原定十天的生产计划八天全部完成，并做到劳逸结合。
    建设公社的社队干部，都以踏踏实实的作风，通过参加生产，带头完成生产定额，帮助生产小队根据不同劳力和农活制订生产定额，建立生产责任制，及时完成各项生产任务。杨柳大队在制定夏种扫尾和秋田管理的七天生产计划时，开始根据小队提出的生产定额，全大队缺三百五十个工。因此，有些小队干部产生了畏难情绪，认为要完成计划就不能保证质量，要保证质量就得放慢进度。为了进一步摸清各种劳力完成生产定额的底细，支部书记、大队长、副大队长、妇女主任等分别深入到四个生产小队，和社员一起耘耥、锄草、积肥，大大超过了原来的生产定额，平均每人每天耘耥由一亩半提高到二亩七分，锄草由七分提高到一亩三分，积肥由六百斤提高到八百斤，晚稻栽插由七分提高到九分六厘。大队干部超额完成生产定额后，发觉过去的定额比较低，同时对于各种农活的生产定额和用工量，完全做到心中有数。在这个基础上，大队干部分片包干，具体帮助生产小队分别不同劳力、工种和规格质量等订出了新的生产定额，并建立了定人、定农活、定质量、定时间、定工分的“五定”生产责任制。由于生产定额切合实际，责任明确，使用劳力合理，及时完成了全大队七天的生产计划。
    这个公社的社队干部都经常帮助生产小队根据当时当地的具体情况，学会掌握生产项目的主次，在集中主要劳力完成主要生产项目的同时，完成一般性的生产项目。华山大队党支部书记林宝德和县委工作组赵玉林同志在山林小队检查田间管理情况时，发现这个小队一百二十亩中稻已耘耥结束，急需积肥追肥，小队却安排了十六个较强的劳力搞棉田锄草和一般性农活，而四个有锄草技术的妇女反在家搞家务劳动。经过和小队干部具体研究，明确以积肥追肥为中心的田间管理后，七天中就积足了中稻需要的追肥，同时完成棉田锄草，麦子复收复打和山芋栽插等任务。
