Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan - After finishing the summer harvest, rural people's commune members in Hubei Province completed their summer grain delivery plan in one vigorous effort.

Hubei farmers, who withstood the severe test of last year's hundred-day drought, said after achieving a bumper summer grain harvest: "The bumper harvest is all thanks to the good leadership of the Party and the government, and the people's communes are shining brightly," "In good years, prepare for famine years, and having grain reserves brings peace of mind." Based on this thinking, the communes enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state, with the speed of sales exceeding any previous year. The quality of the delivered grain was good, generally meeting the requirements of being dry, clean, and full.

This year, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee made early arrangements for the summer grain purchase and storage work, requiring all localities to do a good job of summer harvesting and planting, summer grain purchase, and distribution work together. Party organizations at all levels throughout the province established summer grain purchase and transportation command structures, headed by the first secretaries, to strengthen leadership over related work. During the purchase process, all localities conscientiously implemented the Party's policies, taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members, and retained sufficient grain for consumption, seeds, and fodder. Grain departments also made preparations in advance for storage capacity, repaired roads and bridges necessary for grain delivery, rationally arranged purchasing points, improved receiving methods, and did everything possible to facilitate the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - In the summer grain purchase work, Party committees at all levels in Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, grasped purchase on one hand and distribution on the other, achieving simultaneous grasping of collection, management, and utilization. Now, they have overfulfilled the summer grain purchase plan, and the quality of the grain stored meets all the national standards. Grain for consumption, seeds, and livestock feed for commune members have also been fully retained.

This year, when formulating summer grain distribution plans, all localities in the prefecture took into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, correctly implemented the principle of "combining purchase and retention," ensuring the completion of the state's purchase tasks while retaining sufficient seeds, grain for consumption, and fodder. Shazhuang Brigade of Jiakou Commune in Pi County achieved a bumper harvest of three wheat crops, catching up with the rich teams from a poor team. After retaining sufficient seeds and fodder, and completing the state purchase tasks, the commune members' grain ration increased compared to last year, and more than 80,000 jin of reserve grain were also retained.

　　口粮种子、饲料全部留足
　　湖北完成夏粮交售计划
　　徐州专区收、管、用一齐抓夏粮征购计划完成得好
    新华社武汉电　湖北省农村人民公社社员在结束夏收以后，又一鼓作气地完成了夏粮交售计划。
    经受了去年百日大旱的严重考验的湖北农民，在获得夏粮丰收以后纷纷说：“丰收全靠党和政府的领导好，人民公社放光芒”，“丰年要备灾年粮，有了存粮心不慌”。在这样的思想基础上，各公社踊跃向国家交售余粮，售粮进度之快，超过了以往任何一年。交售的粮食质量良好，一般都达到了干、净、饱的要求。
    今年，中共湖北省委对夏粮征购入库工作，早作了部署，要求各地把夏收夏种、夏粮征购和分配工作一齐作好。全省各级党组织都由第一书记挂帅，层层建立了夏粮征购调运指挥机构，加强对有关工作的领导。在征购中，各地都认真贯彻执行了党的政策，兼顾国家、集体和社员三方面的利益，留足了口粮、种子和饲料。粮食部门也事先做好了仓容等各项准备，修整了送粮必经的道路、桥梁，合理摆布了收购点，改进了接收方法，尽一切可能方便群众。
    新华社南京电　江苏省徐州专区各级党委在夏粮征购工作中，一手抓征购，一手抓分配，做到收、管、用一齐抓，现在已经超额完成了夏粮征购计划，入库粮食的质量全部合乎国家规定的标准。社员口粮、种子、牲畜饲料也已留足。
    今年，专区各地在制定夏季粮食分配方案时，兼顾了国家、集体、个人三者的利益，正确贯彻了“购留结合”的原则，既保证了国家征购任务的完成，又留足了种子、口粮和饲料。邳县加口公社沙庄大队三麦生产获得丰收，由穷队赶上了富队，在留足种子、饲料、完成国家征购任务以后，社员口粮比去年增加，还留存了储备粮八万多斤。（附图片）
