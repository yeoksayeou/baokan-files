Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 3rd: According to the Indian Press Trust, the parliamentary group of the ruling Indian National Congress Party held a meeting on the 2nd, chaired by Congress Party President Reddy, and issued a statement afterwards slandering the planned strike by more than two million employees of the Indian central government system. The statement said that "this strike is unpatriotic and full of danger for the future of the country."

    The statement even linked the strike with the "border situation" with ulterior motives, saying that in view of the "serious border situation and state of emergency," "encouraging these tendencies" would be "contrary to national interests." It also demanded that "all the strength of the country" be used to strengthen "industrial, economic, and military potential."

    The statement wants the government to be "firm and not to yield" (to the strike). Local newspapers reported on the 3rd that the Indian government had held a five-hour negotiation with representatives of government employees on the 2nd in order to prevent the strike. However, the negotiations ultimately failed. The news said that in this negotiation, the government rejected the employees' two basic demands regarding price allowances and minimum wages. Now the government is stepping up measures to deal with the strike, including possibly issuing an order declaring any strike by government employees illegal and taking action against striking workers and their leaders.

    At the same time, the employees' "Joint Action Committee" held an emergency meeting yesterday evening and issued a statement refuting the Congress Party's statement slandering the strike. The committee's statement said that the Congress Party's statement is a "propaganda campaign that reverses black and white and slanders and vilifies." The committee called on employees to actively prepare for the July 11 strike and to hold a "Public Support Day" on July 7.

    The latest issue of the "New Century" weekly also published an editorial expressing support for the employees' demands. The editorial pointed out that it is "useless for the Congress Party to hang up the tattered flag of national emergency to reject the employees' demands."

    印度政府雇员“联合行动委员会”发表声明
    驳斥国大党对罢工的诽谤中伤
    国大党声明竟说罢工是“不爱国”并要求政府不要“屈服”
    新华社新德里3日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度执政党国大党议会党团2日在国大党主席雷迪主持下召开一个会议，会后发表了一项诬蔑印度中央政府系统二百多万雇员计划中的罢工的声明。声明说，“这次罢工是不爱国的，对国家的未来充满着危险”。
    这个声明竟别有用心地把罢工同“边界的局势”联系起来，说什么鉴于“边界上的严重局势和危急状态”，“鼓励这些倾向”将是“违反民族利益的”。它还要求把“国家的一切力量”用于加强“工业、经济和军事的潜力方面”。
    声明要政府“坚决，不要（向罢工）屈服”。这里的报纸3日报道，印度政府为了阻止这次罢工，曾经在2日同政府雇员代表举行了为时五小时的谈判。但是谈判最后宣告失败。消息说，在这次谈判中，政府拒绝了雇员们的关于物价津贴和最低工资的两项基本要求。现在政府正在加紧采取对付罢工的措施，其中包括可能发布一项命令，宣布政府雇员的任何罢工都是非法的，并且采取行动对付参加罢工的职工和他们的领导人。
    同时，雇员们的“联合行动委员会”在昨天傍晚举行了紧急会议，并且发表声明驳斥国大党诬蔑罢工的声明。委员会的声明说，国大党的声明是“颠倒黑白和诽谤中伤的宣传运动”。委员会号召雇员们积极准备7月11日的罢工，并在7月7日举行“公众支持日”。
    最近一期的“新世纪”周报也发表社论，表示支持雇员们的要求。社论指出，国大党“挂起国家紧急状态的破旗来拒绝雇员们的要求是没有用的。”
