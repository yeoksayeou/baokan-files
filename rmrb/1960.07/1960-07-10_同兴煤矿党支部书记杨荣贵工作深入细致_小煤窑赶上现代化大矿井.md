(Our newspaper from Chongqing, 9th) Yang Ronggui, Party Branch Secretary of Chongqing Qijiang Tongxing Coal Mine, together with the branch committee members, has led all the mine's workers to overcome numerous difficulties over the past year, transforming Tongxing Coal Mine from a backward mine into the most advanced red banner mine in the province. The main indicators have caught up with and surpassed large modern mines such as Zhongliangshan. It has been awarded honorary titles such as "Red Banner Coal Mine" by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, "First-Class Red Banner" by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and "Large-Area High-Yield Red Banner" by the Ministry of Coal Industry. Comrade Yang Ronggui was also named an Advanced Worker of Chongqing Municipality. Workers praise him as: "Our good secretary and good leader."

Wherever there are difficulties, there is the Secretary

This mine was originally a primitive coal kiln with only two small, one-meter-square coal holes and a dilapidated thatched hut. In the process of fighting against difficulties, Comrade Yang Ronggui always stood at the forefront of the difficulties, fighting alongside the workers. Wherever there were difficulties, he would go there; wherever there was a weak link, he would launch an assault there. When mining began, the first problem encountered was the lack of pit props in the well, making it impossible for workers to go down. Yang Ronggui and the masses climbed steep slopes, scaled cliffs, and explored old coal kilns to bring back a large number of pit props. When the mine's ground transportation could not keep up with the needs, Comrade Yang Ronggui and other branch committee members immediately led the workers, braving the pouring rain, to drill into the mountains and forests to survey routes and study plans. After the miners fought day and night, a wooden track of nearly twenty li was built in a month. Soon, the wooden track was converted into a highway, so that raw coal could be continuously transported out.

The more production leaps forward, the more meticulous the work must be

In leading the work, Comrade Yang Ronggui often used the idea of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward to lead production. When the mine's daily output leaped from the original sixty or seventy tons to more than three hundred tons, the branch analyzed various favorable conditions and immediately formulated a new target of four hundred tons per day while the iron was hot. In order to achieve the new target, Comrade Yang Ronggui held several branch committee meetings to study and understand the situation, and decided to transform the old mine into a new mine through solid and meticulous work. However, during the transformation process, employees had two different views. Some people believed that technical transformation should rely on the allocation of equipment from higher authorities. The majority believed that they must take the road of self-reliance. Comrade Yang Ronggui supported the latter opinion and criticized the idea of waiting and relying on foreign equipment; and fully mobilized the masses to put forward innovative suggestions for using indigenous methods to transform the mine, with more than eight hundred indigenous methods for improving tunnel ventilation and transportation alone. In just over two months, this small coal mine was quickly transformed into a semi-indigenous, semi-foreign medium-sized coal mine. Coal production quickly surpassed the Songzao and Zhongliangshan large coal mines nearby that used mechanized production.

Establishing a banner to promote the mine's production

In leading the work, Comrade Yang Ronggui also paid special attention to cultivating advanced elements, helping backward elements, and driving the general work, in order to promote the production of the entire mine. In labor, he and other branch committee members established close relationships with the workers. Workers would promptly report any ideological issues to him; workers would promptly seek him out to solve any difficulties, so he often had a very specific and detailed understanding of the workers' ideological situation and production situation. Yang Ronggui went deep into the Wang Zhongzhi youth team of the second well and found that Zhou Xianglin, a veteran worker in this team, could mine six or seven tons of coal every day, which was much higher than the general level. He immediately summarized his operating methods and sent him to fraternal mines for study and observation. One day, his daily output increased to seventy-three tons. Yang Ronggui seized the opportunity and immediately held an on-site meeting to mobilize employees to launch a production competition of "Learning from Zhou Xianglin, Catching up with Zhou Xianglin, and Surpassing Zhou Xianglin." Zhou Xianglin repeatedly won victories and continued to leap forward. His daily output increased from seventy-three tons to one hundred tons, and finally created a record high of 513 tons per day. The output of the entire team also increased significantly. Afterwards, Yang Ronggui also focused on helping the less productive Yu Xianrong team, organizing this team and the Wang Zhongzhi team to carry out a rival match, sending Yu Xianrong to the Wang Zhongzhi team to learn and gain experience, and promoting advanced operating methods, which also led to a sharp increase of more than 50% in the team's coal production, catching up with the Wang Zhongzhi team. Under the leadership of these two advanced teams, the production level of other teams has generally increased. From January to May this year, the annual national plan was overfulfilled by seven months ahead of schedule, and coal production increased by more than 50% compared with the entire year of last year.

### 同兴煤矿党支部书记杨荣贵工作深入细致  小煤窑赶上现代化大矿井

    同兴煤矿党支部书记杨荣贵工作深入细致
    小煤窑赶上现代化大矿井
    工人有什么思想问题就找他汇报，有什么困难就找他解决，他对工人的思想情况生产情况了解得很具体
    本报重庆9日电　重庆綦江同兴煤矿党支部书记杨荣贵同志，一年多来和支部委员们一起领导全矿职工克服了重重困难，使同兴煤矿由落后矿变为一个全省最先进的红旗矿。主要指标赶上超过了中梁山等大型现代化矿井。获得中共重庆市委“红旗煤矿”、中共四川省委“一级红旗”和煤炭工业部“大面积丰产红旗”等光荣称号。杨荣贵同志也被评为重庆市的先进工作者。职工们称赞他是：“我们的好书记好领导。”
    哪里有困难，哪里就有书记
    这个矿原来是一个土煤窑，仅有两个一米见方的小煤洞，一间破草房。他们在和困难作斗争的过程中，杨荣贵同志始终站在困难的最前面，和职工一起奋战，哪里有困难，他就到哪里，哪里是薄弱环节，就到哪里突击。开始采煤时，首先碰到井内没有坑木，工人无法下井。杨荣贵和群众一起爬陡坡，攀峭壁，探进旧煤窑内，抬回来了大批坑木。当这个矿地面运输跟不上需要时，杨荣贵同志和其他支委们立即带领工人，冒着倾盆大雨，钻在山林里，勘察路线，研究规划。经过矿工们日夜战斗，一个月就修通了将近二十里的木轨道。不久，又将木轨道改修为公路，从而原煤就可以源源运出了。
    生产越是跃进工作越要细致
    杨荣贵同志在领导工作中，经常以不断革命和不断跃进的思想来领导生产，当这个矿的日产量由原来的六、七十吨跃进到三百多吨时，支部分析了各种有利条件，趁热打铁，立即制订了日产四百吨的新指标。杨荣贵同志为了实现新指标，多次召开支委会研究了解情况，决定通过做踏实细致的工作，把旧矿井改造成为新矿井。但在改造过程中，职工思想上有着两种不同的看法，有的人认为要进行技术改造就得依靠上级调拨设备。多数人认为必须走自力更生的道路。杨荣贵同志支持了后一种意见，批判了等待求洋的思想；并充分发动群众提土法改造矿井的革新建议，仅有关改进巷道通风和运输的土办法就有八百多条。两个多月时间，这个小煤窑就迅速改造成为半土半洋的中型煤矿。煤的产量迅速超过了附近用机械化生产的松藻和中梁山等大型煤矿。
    树立旗帜，推动全矿生产
    杨荣贵同志在领导工作中，还特别注意培养先进，帮助后进，带动一般的工作，以推动全矿生产。他和其他支部委员们在劳动中，与工人建立了亲密的感情。工人有什么思想就及时向他汇报；工人有什么困难就及时找他解决，因而他对工人的思想情况和生产情况经常了解得很具体很细致。杨荣贵深入二井王忠志青年班跟班劳动中，发现这个班的周相林老师傅每天能采六、七吨煤，比一般水平高出很多。马上就总结了他的操作方法，又派他到兄弟矿去参观学习。有一天，他的日产量提高到七十三吨。杨荣贵就抓住火候，立即召开了现场会，发动职工开展“学周相林、赶周相林，超周相林”的生产大竞赛。周相林屡战屡捷，连续跃进，日产量由七十三吨、一百吨最后创造了日产五百一十三吨的最高纪录，全班的产量也显著上升。此后，杨荣贵又有重点地帮助生产较差的余显荣班，组织这个班和王忠志班开展对手赛，派余显荣去王忠志班学习取经，推广了先进操作方法，使这个班的煤产量也猛增50％以上，赶上了王忠志班。在这两个先进班的带动下，其他各班的生产水平都普遍上升。今年1至5月份已提前七个月超额完成了全年的国家计划，煤产量比去年全年提高50％以上。
