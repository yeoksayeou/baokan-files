    Officers Go Down to the Companies
    Senior Colonel Wang Brings Cooks to the Company
    In the work team led by Senior Colonel Wang Hongrong, there were two veteran cooks with more than twenty years of cooking experience. As soon as Wang Hongrong arrived at the company, he held separate forums with the company's cadres, cooks, and soldiers from different regions to understand the company's food situation and their opinions on the food. After understanding, it was found that the main reason for the company's inadequate food adjustment was the cooks' lack of skills.
    The next day, the work team organized a cooking skills demonstration in this company and invited cooks from other companies to observe and learn. They performed cutting, boiling, steaming, stir-frying, and mixing according to the supply standards and the types of dishes available in the company, explaining as they went. The same dishes became different when they were made by them, and the cooks were all fascinated. After the observation, Wang Hongrong also held a forum with the cooks, encouraging everyone to love their jobs and improve the company's life.
    Old General Goes Down to the Company to Pass on Work Style
    Major General Kong Junbiao of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan led a work team to the Third Company, where he ate, lived, studied, worked, and consulted with the soldiers, setting a good example for cultivating the "Three-Eight" work style in the company.
    Kong Junbiao worked until after midnight every day before resting, and got up with the soldiers in the morning. In the middle of the night, he would quietly sneak into the squads and platoons to check the beds, cover the soldiers with quilts, put down mosquito nets, and check sentry posts at the camp gate. Whether in the classroom or in the field, whether day or night, he participated in the activities of the troops. In the evening, when the troops were conducting the third exercise in the mountains, he went and returned with the soldiers, crawling and rolling with them. He was also very concerned about the soldiers' health, not only personally inspecting the kitchen's cleanliness and the cooks' cooking skills, but also going to the camp to find doctors to understand the situation of the sick and instructing them to do a good job in prevention.
    Director Song Serves as "Political Instructor"
    When a certain unit's Third Battalion was training, Deputy Director of the Political Department Senior Colonel Song Shiyong arrived. Seeing that the political instructor was not at home, he said humorously, "I'll be your political instructor!"
    This newly arrived instructor participated in field operations with the soldiers as soon as he arrived at the company. One day, Song Shiyong followed the troops over five mountains to work, carefully observing the soldiers' movements. When he found that some soldiers in the Ninth Squad were not performing the movements according to the standard, he patiently told the squad leader Jiang Shaonan to organize the whole squad to visit, compare, and learn from each other. After the evaluation and learning, the new soldiers' movements quickly met the standard, and the experience was promoted throughout the company. Song Shiyong also participated in the nighttime shooting rehearsal with the soldiers, helping the soldiers to correct their movements, and exchanged opinions with the cadres, working until late at night before returning.
    Regimental Commander Liang Goes to the Front Line in Person
    Liang Zuodong, the regimental commander of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, is a special-class combat hero who has repeatedly made outstanding achievements in the Liberation War. Now, with the attitude of charging into battle as he did in those years, he personally goes to the front line to guide construction.
    For several days, the Second Company had many misfires when excavating the pilot tunnel. He went to find the reason, watched the blasting workers load explosives and ignite them several times, checked the explosives shed, tested the detonating cords, and checked the misfires with the blasting workers in the pilot tunnel where the smoke had not yet cleared. Finally, he found the cause and prevented the misfires.
    At the construction site, Liang Zuodong labored with the soldiers whenever he had time. One day, he mixed concrete with the soldiers of the Third Company on the arch frame where people were coming and going, and rolling beads of sweat dripped from his weathered cheeks onto the ash tray. While mixing, he picked out the gravel with red rust and mud and said to the soldiers, "Quality is the first priority in a century-long plan, don't put these gravel in!"

    军官下连队
    王大校带炊事员下连
    王洪荣大校率领的工作组里，有两名有二十多年做饭经验的老炊事员。王洪荣一到连队，就找连队干部、炊事员和不同籍贯的士兵分别开座谈会，了解连队伙食情况和他们对伙食的意见。经过了解，发现连队伙食调剂不够好的主要原因是炊事员技术不高。
    第二天，工作组就在这个连队专门组织烹调技术表演，并召集其他连队的炊事员来观摩、学习。他们按供给标准和连里现有菜的种类，进行了切、煮、蒸、炒、配表演，一边做一边讲。同样的菜经过他们的手做出来就不一样了，炊事员个个看得出神。在观摩结束后，王洪荣又和炊事员进行了座谈，勉励大家热爱本职工作，把连队生活改善得更好。
    老将军下连传作风
    驻云南的解放军某部孔骏彪少将率领工作组一到三连，就和战士同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同商量，为连队培养三八作风树立了良好榜样。
    孔骏彪每天工作到夜晚十二点以后才休息，早晨又和士兵一齐起床，半夜里还要悄悄摸进班、排查铺，给战士盖被子、拉蚊帐，到营门口查哨。不管课堂和野外，不管白天和晚上，他都参加部队的活动。晚上部队在山上实施第三练习时，与战士同去同归，一块摸爬滚打。他对士兵的身体也非常关心，不仅亲自检查伙房清洁卫生及炊事员的烹调技术，而且还到营部找医生了解病号情况，指示他们搞好预防工作。
    宋主任当“教导员”
    某部三营，正在训练时候，政治部副主任宋世永上校来了。他一看政治教导员不在家，就很有风趣地说：“我来当你们的教导员吧！”
    这位新来的教导员，到了连队就和战士一起参加野外操作。一天，宋世永跟着部队翻过五座山去作业，他仔细地观察战士的动作。当他发现九班有些战士动作不合标准时，就耐心地告诉班长姜少南，要他组织全班参观评比，互相学习。经过评比学习，新战士的动作很快就合乎标准，并且在全连推广了经验。宋世永还和战士们一起参加夜间射击预习，帮助战士纠正动作，和干部交换意见，忙到深夜才回去。
    梁团长亲临第一线
    铁道兵某部团长梁作栋，是解放战争中屡建奇功的特等战斗英雄。现在他以当年冲锋陷阵的姿态，亲临第一线上，指导施工。
    有几天，二连开挖导坑，总是瞎炮多。他就去找原因，几次看爆破手们怎样装药、点火，查看炸药棚，试验导火索，并在硝烟未散的导坑里，和爆破手们一起查瞎炮。终于找出了原因，防止了瞎炮。
    在工地上，梁作栋一有空，就和战士一起劳动。一天，他在人来人往的拱架上，和三连战士一起拌合混凝土，滚滚的汗珠从饱经风霜的脸颊滴到灰盘上。他一面拌合，一面拣出带红锈和泥巴的石碴对战士们说：“百年大计质量第一呵，千万不能把这些石碴打在里面！”
