    Helping Poor Areas Take Root and Become Prosperous
    —Old Models Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting Treat Others' Difficulties as Their Own
    Rong Biao, Jian Liangming
    Wu Chun'an, a national model agricultural worker and director of the Xiliang Management Area of the Chengguan Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, and Ma Fangting, director of the Dongguan Management Area, have highly developed the spirit of communism and are helping poor areas catch up.
    Both Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting, the two old models, worked as hired laborers for landlords for many years before liberation, enduring all kinds of hardships. After liberation, the Party gave them new life. They listened to the Party and led the local farmers towards the road of common prosperity. However, there were still some management areas in their own commune that had poor natural conditions, limited production avenues, and a low standard of living. Therefore, they not only frequently educated commune members to help their brothers in poor areas, but also set an example themselves.
    Wu Chun'an Transmits Knowledge and Experience
    This year, in order to realize the high-yield cotton plan, the Chengguan Commune Party Committee decided that Wu Chun'an, Ma Fangting, and other comrades would specifically guide cotton production in poor areas. Comrade Wu Chun'an focused on the Xiaoshi Management Area to gain experience and guide the overall work. On July 8th, Wu Chun'an and Wang Jianhao, the deputy director of the management area, took a bag of 25% DDT pesticide and went to the Xiaoshi Management Area for the fourth time. Before dawn, they set off, went deep into the cotton fields, and, together with Guo Qiaolian, the secretary of the Xiaoshi District Party Branch, Li Siming, the technical section chief, and more than thirty cotton farmers, traveled throughout the 850 mu of cotton fields. While visiting and identifying, they conducted specific research on key technologies such as how to manage pre-bud cotton, protect the buds, and strive for autumn cotton based on the different growth of cotton seedlings. The following is an excerpt from their conversation:
    Li Siming humbly asked, "Why are some of the cotton seedlings here yellow and some green?" Wu Chun'an replied, "They lack moisture and nutrients, especially nitrogen fertilizer." Li asked, "Do you think the depth of cultivation is okay?" Wu said, "According to the current growth of cotton seedlings, the seedlings in irrigated and fertile land have tall stalks and many buds. After watering, the cultivation should generally be deepened to two to three inches to promote stable growth of the seedlings and more buds and bolls. In dry land and land with small seedlings, more cultivation should be done to preserve moisture and promote seedling growth and more buds and bolls." Li asked, "How should we prune now?" Wu said, "On the basis of removing the lower leaves, promptly remove strong buds and appropriately leave 'youtiao' (a type of fried dough stick that looks like a strip of strong growth) on the edges of the field, at the ends of the field, and in sparse areas to increase the source of bolls."
    Through on-site teaching of experience and technology, the bud-stage technical management work of cotton fields in this management area was greatly promoted. That afternoon, the entire district mobilized 168 cotton farmers to lightly irrigate 78 mu of irrigated cotton fields once, and also cultivated 320 mu of dry-land cotton seedlings. Commune member Du Xiuying said gratefully, "Wu Chun'an is really a cotton teacher. His mouth is an advanced technology machine, and his belly is a treasure trove of advanced experience. One teaching session is better than attending school once."
    Climbing Mountains and Ridges, Embarking on a Distant Journey to Grow Vegetables
    On the afternoon of July 9th, a heavy rain suddenly fell in the northeast of Yicheng. Farmers were overjoyed after a long drought. But at two o'clock in the morning that night, Comrade Ma Fangting was still awake. Accountant Zhao Dehua, who was somehow awakened, quickly called Ma Fangting, "Lao Ma! Why haven't you fallen asleep yet?" Ma Fangting casually replied, "I thought of an important matter." "What important matter?" Dehua asked again. Ma Fangting said, "Growing vegetables." Dehua said, "Growing vegetables? We don't have any land, where can we grow them?" Ma Fangting replied, "There's plenty of land!" As he spoke, Ma Fangting jumped out of bed, turned on the light, walked out the door. In a short while, he came back with a bag of vegetable seeds on his back and said to Dehua, "I'm going to send these vegetable seeds to Wangzhuang."
    In the pitch-black wilderness, Ma Fangting called up two skilled vegetable growers, carried spinach and radish seeds, crossed the Hui River, climbed the stone slope, walked more than twenty li, and arrived at the Wangzhuang Management Area at dawn. After discussing with Xiao Wenzhong, the deputy secretary of the commune party committee who had come here, the commune organized a friendship mobile team to support poor areas in growing vegetables. Their group of seven people climbed mountains and ridges, traveled to nine poor areas such as Shandi and Liujiazhuang, and taught more than a thousand commune members vegetable growing and management techniques with the content of "what kind of land is suitable for what kind of vegetables, and how should the vegetables be managed." They were warmly welcomed by the masses. When the cadres and members of the Qingshuwa Management Area received the vegetable seeds supported by Ma Fangting, they all gratefully said in unison, "These are communist seeds, seeds of friendship. We will never forget them!" That day, Qiao Songbai, the secretary of the Party branch of this management area, led thirty-six strong laborers and planted 56 mu of vegetables in four hours.
    "Wu Ma No. 1" Blossoms and Bears Fruit
    Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting have worked together since 1957 to carefully hybridize one mu of cotton using 517 and Dai Zi No. 15. In the autumn, each plant had twenty-four bolls, and each boll weighed an average of two qian. After three consecutive years of testing, they successfully cultivated an excellent variety most suitable for local characteristics, which the masses named "Wu Ma No. 1". The advantages of this variety are: fast emergence, many cotton bolls, large cotton bolls, short branches, few strong buds, long lint, long lint percentage, many white flowers before frost, few red flowers after frost, and strong drought and disease resistance. This cotton seed yields 8.9% to 19.3% more than the previous two cotton varieties. Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting, in the spirit of "others first, themselves later," supported 22,000 jin of cotton seeds to fourteen poor areas in the commune this year, and also supported 22,000 jin to the whole county and other places. The 1,100 mu of "Wu Ma No. 1" cotton sown in the fourteen poor areas is growing particularly vigorously. Commune members generally reflect: "'Wu Ma No. 1' is really good, easy to manage, and yields high."
    Driving the "Five Roads" to Great Support
    Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee and influenced by the model actions of Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting, the whole commune saw a high tide of the commune-run machinery factory, supply and marketing cooperative, bank, school, and rich areas supporting poor areas to catch up.
    In the past year, they have helped poor areas complete 28 basic construction projects, supplied 300,000 jin of various chemical fertilizers, 350 pieces of various machinery and production tools, helped with more than 11,000 labor and livestock workdays, invested more than 32,000 yuan in living expenses, and issued more than 50,000 yuan in loans. Through the arduous struggle of the commune members in the poor areas, the 22,000 mu of wheat in the 14 poor areas of the commune achieved a bumper harvest this year. By the end of June, the total income in terms of money increased by 23.5% compared with the same period last year, and the average income per person was more than 41 yuan, an increase of 21% compared with the same period last year. At present, the grain crops and cotton in all poor areas are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is promising in the autumn.
    Why do Wu Chun'an and Ma Fangting automatically and actively support poor areas in this way? These two red old models replied: "The difficulties of others are also our own difficulties; the prosperity of others is also our own prosperity; the glory of others is also our own glory." What a lofty communist style!

    帮助穷区扎富根
    ——老模范吴春安、马芳庭把别人的困难当自己的困难
    荣彪体　健梁明
    全国农业劳动模范、山西翼城县城关公社西梁管理区主任吴春安和东关管理区主任马芳庭二同志，高度的发扬共产主义精神，帮助穷区赶自己。
    吴春安、马芳庭两位老模范，解放前都给地主当了多年长工，受尽了千辛万苦。解放后，党给了他们新的生命。他们听党的话，带领当地农民走向了共同富裕的道路。但是，就在自己所在的公社仍有部分管理区，由于自然条件差，生产门路不广，生活水平还不高。所以，他俩不但经常教育社员要帮助穷区兄弟，而且自己首先以身作则。
    吴春安传经送宝
    今年，城关公社党委为实现棉花高产计划，决定由吴春安、马芳庭等同志具体指导穷区棉花生产。吴春安同志就以晓史管理区为重点，取得经验，指导全面。7月8日，吴春安和管理区副主任王建镐同志，带了一袋25％的滴滴涕药剂，第四次到晓史管理区。这一天，东方还未发亮，他俩就动了身，深入到棉田里，和晓史区党支部书记郭巧莲、技术股长李思明等三十多个棉农，跑遍了八百五十亩棉田，边参观、边鉴定，按照棉苗生长不同的情况，对如何抓伏前桃、保伏桃、争秋桃等关键性的技术，进行了具体研究。下边是他们的一段对话：
    李思明虚心地问道：“这里棉苗为啥有黄有绿？”吴春安回答：“缺少水分和养分，尤其缺氮肥。”李问：“你看这样中耕深度行不行？”吴说：“按当前棉苗生长情况，水地和肥地棉苗是身高蕾多，浇水后一般中耕要加深到二至三寸，促进棉苗稳长，多结蕾铃；旱地和小苗地，要多中耕，可以保墒发苗多结蕾铃。”李问：“现在该怎样整枝？”吴说：“在脱裤腿的基础上，及时打去强芽，适当在地边、地头和苗稀的地方留油条，好增加桃源。”
    通过田间见苗传授经验和技术，大大推动了这个管理区棉田蕾期技术管理工作，当天下午全区就动员了一百六十八名棉农，把七十八亩水地棉花轻灌一次，同时还中耕旱地棉苗三百二十亩。社员杜秀英感激地说：“吴春安真是棉花老师，嘴是先进技术机器，肚子是先进经验宝库，来一次传授，比住一次学校还强。”
    爬山越岭　远征种菜
    7月9日下午，翼城东北方突然降了一阵大雨。久旱逢甘雨，农民们喜出望外。但在这天夜晚两点钟的时候，马芳庭同志还未入眠。不知怎么被惊醒了的会计赵德华，连忙叫马芳庭：“老马！你怎么还没睡着？”马芳庭随口回答：“我想到一件要紧事。”“什么要紧事？”德华又问。马芳庭说：“种菜。”德华说：“种菜？咱没有地了，往哪儿种？”马芳庭回答说：“地多哩！”说着，说着，马芳庭跳下床去，把灯点着，走出了门。没一刻钟工夫，他背着一口袋菜籽进了门，对德华说：“这菜籽，我给王庄送去。”
    野外漆黑，马芳庭叫起了两个种菜能手，带着菠菜、萝卜籽渡过浍河，爬上石坡，走了二十多里，天明赶到了王庄管理区。经过和来到这里的公社党委副书记萧文忠同志商量，公社组织了一个支援穷区种菜友谊流动组。他们一行七人，爬山越岭，走遍了山底、刘家庄等九个穷区，以“什么地宜种什么菜，什么菜应该怎样管”为内容，向千余名社员传授了种菜和管菜技术，受到了群众热烈欢迎。青树窊管理区干部和社员，收到马芳庭支援的菜籽时，异口同声地感激说：“这是共产主义种籽，是友谊种籽，我们永远不能忘记！”当天，这个管理区的党支部书记乔松柏带领了三十六名强劳力，四小时抢墒种菜五十六亩。
    “吴马一号”开花结果
    吴春安、马芳庭二同志同心协力，从1957年开始，精心地运用五一七和岱字十五号杂交了一亩棉花，秋后每株成桃二十四个，每个桃平均二钱重。经过连续三年试验，培育成功一种最适合当地特点的优良品种，群众起名叫“吴马一号”。这个品种的好处是：出苗快，棉桃多，棉桃大，枝节短，强芽少，绒度长，衣分长，霜前白花多，霜后红花少，抗旱抗病力最强。这个棉种比前两种棉花增产8.9％至19.3％。吴春安和马芳庭本着“先别人，后自己”的精神，今年支援本公社十四个穷区棉籽二万二千斤，还支援全县和外地二万二千斤。现在十四个穷区播种的一千一百亩“吴马一号”棉花，生长格外旺盛。社员们普遍反映：“‘吴马一号’实在好，作务容易产量高。”
    带动“五路”大支援
    在公社党委统一领导下，在吴春安、马芳庭模范行动的影响下，全公社出现了社办机械厂、供销社、银行、学校、富区“五路”支援穷区赶富区的高潮。
    近一年来，帮助穷区完成基本建设工程二十八项，供应各种化肥三十万斤，各种机械和生产工具三百五十件，帮助劳畜工一万一千余个，生活投资三万二千多元，发放贷款五万多元。经过穷区社员们发奋苦战，因而全公社十四个穷区，今年二万二千多亩小麦获得丰收。到6月底，金额总收入比去年同期增长23.5％，每人平均收入四十一元多，比去年同期增长21％。目前，所有穷区的粮田作物和棉花普遍生长得好，秋后丰收大有希望。
    吴春安、马芳庭为什么这样自动积极地支援穷区？这两位红色老模范回答说：“别人的困难，也是自己的困难；别人的富裕，也是自己的富裕；别人的光荣，也是自己的光荣”。这是多么崇高的共产主义风格！
