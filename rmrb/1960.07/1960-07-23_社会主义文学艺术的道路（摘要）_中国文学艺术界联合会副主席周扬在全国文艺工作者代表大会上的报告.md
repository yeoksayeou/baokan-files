Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a lengthy report today entitled "The Road of Socialist Literature and Art" at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers.

In his report, Zhou Yang outlined the extremely significant achievements and rich experiences gained in Chinese literary and artistic work since the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in July 1949 and the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in September 1953, especially since the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the national socialist construction. He pointed out that literature and art have become a common cause of the broad masses of all nationalities throughout the country, that revolutionary literature and art have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and that many literary and artistic works have strong and distinct revolutionary and militant qualities, shaping true images of heroic figures among the masses. Literature and art are increasingly characterized by nationalization and massification. Practice has proven that the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, as prescribed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are the correct path for developing and prospering socialist literature and art in our country.

Zhou Yang then elaborated in detail on the issue of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He said: The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has opened up a new world for literature and art, enabling writers and artists to find new themes, new subjects of expression, and new audiences to serve. This is the direction of the development of human literature and art, and a great revolution in literature and art. To serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers today is to serve the socialist cause being undertaken by millions of people, to serve the Party's general line, to serve the communist tomorrow, and to serve the lofty cause of opposing imperialism and striving for lasting peace. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Lenin's principles on Party literature and thoroughly solved the problem of the integration of literature and art with the workers and peasants. Comrade Mao Zedong placed the core of all problems on the fundamental issue of literary and art workers integrating with the worker-peasant masses, thereby transforming their own worldviews. Zhou Yang pointed out: Only by going deep among the worker-peasant masses, participating in productive labor and practical struggle, and making themselves worker-peasant-like, can literary and art workers become familiar with the lives, emotions, and language of the workers and peasants, write vivid works that faithfully express the worker-peasant masses, and only then can intellectual writers and artists of non-proletarian origin change their original worldviews, establish a communist worldview, and become genuine worker-class writers and artists. Even literary and art workers of worker-peasant origin or young ones trained in the new society need to constantly transform themselves and participate in productive labor, otherwise they will not be able to withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology and will embark on erroneous or even reactionary paths. Therefore, the worker-peasantization of literary and art workers is the fundamental key to the worker-peasant-soldier direction of literature and art.

Zhou Yang summarized a series of struggles against bourgeois ideology on the literary and artistic front over the past decade, pointing out that these struggles have cleared the way for the free development of socialist literature and art. To implement the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is necessary to wage constant struggles against modern revisionism and various bourgeois ideas, which is a long-term task on the ideological front.

In his report, Zhou Yang focused on the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and the flourishing situation of comprehensive and diversified development of various categories of literature and art under the guidance of this policy. He pointed out: Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend and bringing forth new ideas on the basis of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause is the most correct, broadest, and most creative path for developing socialist literature and art. This path guides the talents and creativity of writers and artists of various schools and styles to a common great goal, and combines the individual wisdom of writers and artists with the collective wisdom of the masses. He refuted the malicious misinterpretations of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend by revisionists, and also criticized the erroneous views of this policy by dogmatists. He pointed out that dogmatists do not understand dialectics and do not recognize the diversity of the world. They only allow one flower to bloom alone and do not want a hundred flowers to bloom. This is very harmful. We should advocate diversification in artistic styles, forms, and themes, encourage free creation, and oppose uniformity. Our principle is the unity of consistency in political direction and diversity in artistic style. Only diversified art can meet the diverse needs of the masses, better serve revolutionary politics, and enable the different personalities and talents of literary and art workers to be brought into play. On academic and ideological issues, we should oppose arbitrariness, suppression, and crude criticism, and advocate gradually reaching correct conclusions through full discussion.

Zhou Yang emphasized that: Whether in literary and artistic direction, literary and artistic path, or artistic methods, there are sharp differences between us and revisionism. And this ultimately boils down to the difference between two fundamentally different political lines and two different worldviews. He strongly condemned the current promotion by revisionists of fallacies such as bourgeois human nature theory, bourgeois hypocritical humanitarianism, and bourgeois pacifism, attempting to reconcile class antagonisms, negate class struggle and revolution, and spread illusions about imperialism, in order to achieve their sinister goals of protecting the old capitalist world. He pointed out: The theory of human nature is a major ideological weapon of revisionism. They use abstract common human nature to explain various historical and social phenomena, use human nature or "humanitarianism" as the standard of morality and art, oppose literature and art becoming a revolutionary tool of the proletariat, and use the viewpoint of human nature to oppose the people's just revolutionary war. Under the influence of this revisionist ideology, some literary and artistic works and films depict revolutionary war as a scene of misery and greatly distort the history of revolutionary war. This situation can only show that the author is frightened by the threat of imperialist war, so that he loses the proper position of a revolutionary writer and becomes a prisoner of the imperialist atomic blackmail policy. Such works can only intimidate the people, paralyze the people's will to fight, and make the people lose confidence in their own strength and future, and will not help in the slightest to defend and consolidate the great cause of peace. Zhou Yang said that modern revisionists oppose historical materialism with historical idealism, oppose class struggle with class reconciliation, oppose the theory of class with the theory of human nature, and oppose the revolutionary human nature of the proletariat with the decadent human nature of the bourgeoisie. This is the reactionary essence of the revisionists' theory of human nature.

In his report, Comrade Zhou Yang also talked about the issue of critically inheriting literary and artistic heritage. He pointed out that Marxists advocate taking a critical approach to the inheritance of all heritage, and oppose blind worship. Our literary and art workers should learn from all the excellent literary and artistic heritage of China and foreign countries, but learning must not restrict our hands and feet and hinder our creativity. We must learn from our predecessors, but we must not belittle ourselves. We should have the courage to surpass our predecessors.

When discussing the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, Zhou Yang pointed out that this artistic method applies the principle of combining revolutionary spirit and pragmatic spirit to literature and art, and dialectically unifies the two artistic methods of realism and romanticism in literature and art, so as to better express the heroic era and heroic figures of the people, to comprehensively absorb all the excellent traditions in the literary and artistic heritage, and to better give play to the different personalities and styles of writers and artists. Revolutionary romanticism is, in essence, revolutionary idealism. Modern revisionists attack our literature and art precisely because they hate the revolutionary tendency expressed in our literature and art. They deliberately oppose tendency and authenticity, and they exclude advanced ideals from life. Their so-called "realism" is also realism without ideals, and is actually not realism, but petty naturalism and decadence. Zhou Yang refuted the revisionists' attacks on socialist realism, pointing out that our literature and art should give greater play to the spirit of socialism and communism, and writers and artists should stand on the peak of the highest ideal of communism in this era to observe life and describe life, and strive to promote the progress of society.

Finally, Zhou Yang put forward the tasks for literary and art workers in the future:

First, we must unswervingly and better implement Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line; this is the line of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth new ideas on the basis of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause; this is the line of combining popularization and improvement of literature and art; this is the line of combining literary and art workers with the worker-peasant masses. At the same time, we must adhere to the principle of putting politics in command in literary and artistic work and strengthen the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

Second, literary and art workers should resolutely stand on the forefront of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and on the forefront of opposing imperialism and opposing modern revisionism. We should use various literary and artistic weapons to reflect the revolutionary struggles of the people of our country and the people of the world. We should closely unite with socialist artists from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, highly promote the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and learn from their advanced experiences; we should, in the common struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, closely unite with all patriotic, progressive, and revolutionary artists in the world, especially artists in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and form a broad revolutionary united front of literature and art against imperialism headed by the United States and its reactionary allies in various countries. We must continue to launch struggles against modern revisionism and all bourgeois reactionary ideas, and oppose the reactionary and corrupt culture of American imperialism and its harmful influences. The struggle against bourgeois ideology is a long-term task. It is absolutely not permissible to cancel and relax this struggle, and to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards bourgeois ideology.

Third, we must implement the mass line, actively develop the amateur literary and art movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers, encourage mass creation, encourage literary and art specialists to cooperate with the worker-peasant masses in creation, and highly promote the spirit of collectivism in literature and art. We should also pay special attention to developing the literature and art of all fraternal nationalities, so that our literary and artistic garden becomes a multi-ethnic, colorful, socialist literary and artistic grand garden.

Fourth, literary and art workers should strive to improve their ideological cultivation and literary and artistic cultivation, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and at the same time constantly improve their artistic skills, tenfold and a hundredfold improve the ideological level and artistic level of their works, and do their utmost to create literary and artistic works that move the hearts of millions of people.

Fifth, actively develop a militant and creative Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory and literary and artistic criticism, in order to promote the healthy development of creation and help the people improve their artistic discernment and appreciation. We should also attach importance to cultivating new forces in literary and artistic theory and criticism, and strive to establish a Marxist literary and artistic theory team.

Sixth, strengthen the work of various associations and literary and artistic organizations in the literary and artistic circles. Make various associations and literary and artistic organizations the most active combat units on the literary and artistic front of the working class. Various literary and artistic organizations should play their active role in organizing writers and artists to carry out creation, study, labor, and go deep into the lives of the masses.

Zhou Yang emphasized at the end of his report: As long as we, under the leadership of the Party, are always loyal to the cause of the Party and the people, always maintain revolutionary vigor, always share the breath of the worker-peasant masses, and constantly learn and constantly improve, we will surely be able to complete the mission entrusted to us by history and create works worthy of this great and heroic era.

    社会主义文学艺术的道路（摘要）
    中国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬在全国文艺工作者代表大会上的报告
    新华社22日讯　中国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬今天在中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上，作了题为“社会主义文学艺术的道路”的长篇报告。
    周扬在报告中，概述了自从1949年7月全国第一次文代大会和1953年9月全国第二次文代大会以来，特别是在全国社会主义建设事业各方面大跃进以来，中国的文学艺术工作所取得的极其重大的成就和极其丰富的经验。他指出，文艺已成为全国各民族广大人民共同的事业，革命的文艺已深入人民群众的心灵，许多文艺作品具有强烈鲜明的革命性和战斗性，塑造了人民群众中的英雄人物的真实形象。文学艺术越来越具有民族化群众化的特色。实践证明：党中央和毛主席所规定的为工农兵服务的方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策，正是发展和繁荣我国社会主义文学艺术的正确路线。
    周扬接着详细地阐述了文艺为工农兵服务的方向的问题。他说：文艺的工农兵方向，给文学艺术开辟了新的天地，使作家艺术家找到了新的主题、新的表现对象和新的服务对象。这是人类文艺发展的方向，是文学艺术的伟大革命。为工农兵服务，在今天就是要为千百万群众正在进行的社会主义事业服务，为党的总路线服务，为共产主义的明天服务，为反对帝国主义，争取持久和平的崇高事业服务。毛泽东同志创造性地发展了列宁关于党的文学的原则，彻底解决了文艺和工农相结合的问题。毛泽东同志把一切问题的中心放在文艺工作者同工农群众结合，从而改造自己的世界观这个根本问题上。周扬指出：文艺工作者只有深入工农群众，参加生产劳动和实际斗争，使自己工农化，才有可能熟悉工农的生活、情感和语言，写出忠实的表现工农群众的生动作品，才有可能使非无产阶级出身的知识分子作家艺术家，改变原来的世界观，树立共产主义的世界观，成为名副其实的工人阶级的作家艺术家。就是工农出身的或者在新社会培养出来的青年文艺工作者，也需要不断地进行改造，参加生产劳动，否则就会经受不住资产阶级思想的侵袭，而走上错误以致反动的道路。所以文艺工作者的工农化是文艺的工农兵方向的根本关键。
    周扬概括地叙述了十年来文艺战线上所进行的一连串的反对资产阶级思想的斗争，指出这些斗争为社会主义文艺的自由发展扫清了道路。要贯彻执行文艺为工农兵服务的方向，必须对现代修正主义和各种资产阶级思想进行不断的斗争，这是思想战线上的一个长期的任务。
    周扬在报告中着重论述了党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，以及在这个方针指导下文艺各个门类全面地多样化地发展的繁荣局面。他指出：在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新，这就是发展社会主义文艺的最正确、最宽广、最富于创造性的道路。这条道路把各种不同流派和风格的作家艺术家的全部才能和创造性，引导到一个共同的伟大的目标上去，而且使作家艺术家的个人智慧和群众的集体智慧结合起来。他驳斥了修正主义者对百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策的恶意曲解，也批判了教条主义者对这个政策的错误看法。他指出教条主义者不懂辩证法，不承认世界的多样性。只许一花独放，不要百花齐放。这是非常有害的。我们在艺术的风格形式和题材等方面应该提倡多样化，鼓励自由创造，反对千篇一律，我们的原则是政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性的统一。只有多样化的艺术，才能满足群众多种多样的需要，才能更好地为革命的政治服务，才能使文艺工作者的不同个性和才能得到发挥。在学术思想问题上，我们应当反对武断，反对压服，反对粗暴批评，而主张经过充分的讨论逐步达到正确的结论。
    周扬强调指出：无论在文艺方向、文艺道路和艺术方法上，我们和修正主义之间都存在着尖锐的分歧。而这归根到底就是两种根本不同的政治路线、两种不同的世界观的分歧。他强烈斥责修正主义者目前正在鼓吹资产阶级人性论、资产阶级虚伪的人道主义和资产阶级和平主义等等谬论，力图调和阶级对立，否定阶级斗争和革命，散布对帝国主义的幻想，以达到他们保护资本主义旧世界的罪恶目的。他指出：人性论是修正主义的一个主要思想武器，他们用抽象的共同人性来解释各种历史现象和社会现象，以人性或“人道主义”作为道德和艺术的标准，反对文艺成为无产阶级的革命工具，他们用人性论的观点反对人民的正义的革命的战争，在这种修正主义思想影响下，有一些文艺作品和电影把革命战争描写成一片凄惨景象，对革命战争历史作了极大的歪曲。这种情况只能表明作者为帝国主义战争威胁所吓倒，以致丧失一个革命作家应有的立场，成为了帝国主义原子讹诈政策的俘虏。这样的作品只能恐吓人民、麻痹人民的斗志，使人民对自己的力量和前途丧失信心，而丝毫无助于保卫和巩固和平的伟大事业。周扬说，现代修正主义者以历史唯心论反对历史唯物论，以阶级调和反对阶级斗争，以人性论反对阶级论，以资产阶级的腐朽的人性反对无产阶级的革命的人性。这就是修正主义者的人性论的反动实质。
    周扬同志在报告中还谈到批判地继承文学艺术遗产问题。他指出，马克思主义者主张对一切遗产采取批判地继承的态度，反对盲目崇拜。我们的文艺工作者应当向中外一切优秀的文艺遗产学习，但学习决不能束缚我们的手脚、妨碍我们的创造性。我们要学习前人，但不要妄自菲薄。我们应当有勇气超过前人。
    周扬在论述革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法时，指出这个艺术方法把革命精神和求实精神相结合的原则运用在文学艺术上，把文学艺术中现实主义和浪漫主义这两种艺术方法辩证地统一起来，以便更有利于表现人民群众的英雄时代和英雄人物，有利于全面地吸取文学艺术遗产中的一切优良传统，有利于更好地发挥作家艺术家不同的个性和风格。革命的浪漫主义从根本内容上讲，就是革命的理想主义。我们的文艺应当创造最能体现无产阶级革命理想的人物，现代修正主义者攻击我们的文艺，正是因为他们痛恨我们文艺中所表现的革命倾向性。他们故意把倾向性和真实性对立起来，他们排除生活中的先进理想，他们的所谓“现实主义”也就是没有理想的现实主义，实际上不是现实主义，而是卑琐的自然主义和颓废主义。周扬驳斥了修正主义者对社会主义现实主义的攻击，指出我们的文艺应当更高度的发挥社会主义、共产主义精神，作家艺术家应该站在共产主义这一时代最高理想的峰顶来观察生活描写生活，为推动社会的前进而努力。
    最后，周扬提出了文艺工作者今后的任务：
    第一，必须坚定不移地更好地贯彻毛泽东同志的文艺路线；这就是在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的路线；这就是文艺的普及和提高相结合的路线；这就是文艺工作者和工农群众相结合的路线。同时必须在文艺工作中坚持政治挂帅的原则，加强党对文艺工作的领导。
    第二，文艺工作者应该坚决地站在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最前线，站在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的最前线。应当用各种文学艺术武器来反映我国人民和世界人民的革命斗争。应当和苏联及其他兄弟国家的社会主义文艺家亲密地团结起来，高度发扬无产阶级的国际主义精神，学习他们的先进经验；应当在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，和全世界一切爱国的、进步的、革命的文艺家，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的文艺家，紧紧地团结起来，结成广泛的反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其在各国的反动同盟军的革命的文艺统一战线。我们要继续展开对现代修正主义和一切资产阶级反动思想的斗争，反对美帝国主义的反动腐烂文化及其有害影响。对资产阶级思想的斗争是一个长期的任务。取消和放松这种斗争，对资产阶级思想采取迎合和调和的态度，是决不能容许的。
    第三，必须贯彻执行群众路线，积极发展工农兵群众的业余文艺运动，鼓励群众创作，鼓励文学艺术专门家在创作上和工农群众合作，高度发扬文学艺术中的集体主义精神。我们还应当特别重视发展各兄弟民族的文艺，使我们的文艺园地成为多民族的、绚烂多采的社会主义文艺大花园。　　第四，文艺工作者应努力提高自己的思想修养和文艺修养，认真学习马克思列宁主义，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，同时不断提高艺术技巧，十倍百倍地提高作品的思想水平和艺术水平，为创造打动千百万人民心灵的文艺作品而尽自己最大的努力。
    第五，积极发展富于战斗性和创造性的马克思列宁主义的文艺理论和文艺批评，以便促进创作的健康发展，并帮助人民提高艺术的鉴别力和欣赏力。还要重视培养文艺理论批评的新生力量，努力建立一支马克思主义的文艺理论队伍。
    第六，加强文艺界各个协会和文艺团体的工作。使各个协会和文艺团体成为工人阶级文艺战线上最活跃的战斗单位。各个文学艺术团体应当在组织作家艺术家进行创作、学习、劳动和深入群众生活各方面发挥它们的积极作用。
    周扬在结束报告时强调说：只要我们在党的领导下，永远忠诚于党和人民的事业，永远保持革命的朝气，永远同工农群众共呼吸，不断学习，不断提高，就一定能够完成历史赋予我们的使命，创造出无愧于这个伟大的英雄时代的作品。
