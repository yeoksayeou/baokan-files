　　Elm Seeds
　　Guo Huang

　　Pear blossoms flutter, white clouds and blue sky,
　　The whole village of elm trees hangs with golden coins,
　　Bell-shaped tender leaves like strings of copper,
　　The wind rings the bells, swallows fly among the trees.
　　Children climb trees, laughing and picking,
　　Some cling to branches, swinging like on swings,
　　Handfuls of tender leaves stuffed into mouths,
　　Schoolbags slide down, falling into wheat fields.
　　My childhood was spent in hunger:
　　Elm trees stripped of their bark,
　　Grass seeds mixed with tears swallowed down,
　　Landlords and Chiang Kai-shek's troops searched every house,
　　How many people carved bloody words on elm trees,
　　Escaping to the Honghu Lake shore...
　　The elm trees of the past were full of sorrow,
　　Today's elm trees grow amidst laughter,
　　A song of elm seeds sprinkled overhead,
　　Someone on the tree shouts: Try this elm leaf,
　　Is it sweet or not!

    榆钱
    郭煌梨花飘飘白云蓝天，全村榆树挂满金钱，铃形的嫩叶好像铜串，风摇铃响燕飞林间。孩儿们爬树嘻笑采摘，有的攀枝荡着秋千，一捧捧嫩叶塞进嘴里，书包滑下落进了麦田。我的童年是在饥饿中过的：榆树剥尽皮，草籽拌泪咽，地主、蒋匪军挨家搜刮，多少人在榆树上刻下血字，逃
  到洪湖边……往昔的榆树根根凄楚，如今的榆树长在欢笑里面，歌声里一把榆钱劈头撒下，树上在吆喝：你尝尝这榆叶甜
  呀不甜！
