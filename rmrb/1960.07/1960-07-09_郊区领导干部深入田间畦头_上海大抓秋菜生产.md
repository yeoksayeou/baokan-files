Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th: Shanghai's suburban areas are seeing many leading cadres braving the scorching sun to go deep into the fields and lead the masses in vigorously grasping autumn vegetable production, to guarantee a sufficient supply of vegetables to the market in August and September.

In the past, the weather in August and September was extremely hot, with concentrated typhoons and rainstorms, and rampant plant diseases and insect pests. Every year during this period, Shanghai's suburban vegetable sowing volume would decrease, yields were not high, and varieties were monotonous, forming a market supply off-season. This year, in order to change this situation and achieve a balanced supply of vegetables throughout the year, the Shanghai Municipal Rural Work Committee held a special meeting to study the sowing and field management of major autumn vegetables. Leading cadres from various counties also went deep into the production front line, and conscientiously led the masses to rush-plant vegetables. In communes with more vegetable cultivation, such as Hongqiao, Yanqiao, and Pengpu, the First Secretaries took charge, and vigorously grasped autumn vegetable production.

Various counties in the suburbs are taking measures to do everything possible to expand the planting of water spinach, Pudong long-stem white cabbage, Guangdong dwarf black mustard, chard, and other leafy vegetables that are resistant to high temperatures and can withstand strong winds, rainstorms, and drought. They are also paying attention to planting spinach, alfalfa, etc., to enrich market supply. Currently, the planting area, varieties, seeds, and fertilizers for leafy vegetables have been implemented to the teams and fields, and the sowing high tide has been launched. By the end of June, the city had sown more than 90,000 mu of leafy vegetables.

Strengthening the management of existing vegetable crops in the fields is an important key to ensuring the supply of vegetables in August and September. These vegetables are mainly melons, beans, and solanaceous fruits, most of which will be on the market in August and September. At present, the communes are focusing on pest control, topdressing, and weeding to strengthen field management and promote crop growth. These days, although the temperature in Shanghai is very high, reaching 37 degrees Celsius, there are still tens of thousands of people's commune members braving the scorching sun to fight in the fields.

### 郊区领导干部深入田间畦头  上海大抓秋菜生产

    郊区领导干部深入田间畦头
    上海大抓秋菜生产
    据新华社上海7日电　上海郊区许多领导干部冒着烈日，深入田间畦头，领导群众大抓秋菜生产，保证8、9月份有充分的蔬菜供应市场。
    8、9月份天气酷热，台风暴雨集中，病虫害猖獗，过去每年到了这个时期，上海郊区蔬菜播种量就减少，产量不高，品种单调，形成市场供应淡季。今年为了改变这个情况，实现蔬菜全年均衡供应，上海市农村工作委员会专门开会研究了大秋蔬菜的播种和田间管理问题。各县有关领导干部也深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地带领群众抢种蔬菜。虹桥、严桥、彭浦等种植蔬菜较多的公社，都由第一书记挂帅，大抓秋菜生产。
    郊区各县都在采取措施，千方百计地扩大种植耐高温和经得起大风、暴雨、干旱侵袭的蕹菜、浦东长梗白菜、广东矮脚乌、牛皮菜等绿叶菜，并且注意种植菠菜、草头等，以丰富市场供应。现在，绿叶菜的种植面积、品种、种子、肥料等已落实到队到田，播种高潮已经掀起。到6月底止，全市已播种叶菜九万多亩。
    加强现有田间蔬菜作物的管理，是保证8、9月份蔬菜供应的重要关键。这类蔬菜主要是瓜类、豆类、茄果类等，其中大部分是8、9月份上市的。目前各公社正以治虫、追肥、除草为中心狠抓田间管理，促进作物生长。这几天，虽然上海温度很高，达到摄氏三十七度，但仍有成千上万的人民公社社员头顶炎日，战斗在田间。
