“Zhakou Shock Brigade Members! Zhakou Shock Brigade Members…” The Ding class steelworkers, who were striving for high production at the open-hearth furnace, listened attentively to the urgent summons from the loudspeaker, ready to charge at any moment. “…No. 5 furnace's slag outlet is leaking steel…” Before the sentence was finished, the second assistants from each furnace, like fierce tigers, rushed towards the slag outlet of No. 5 furnace. Tian Jiamao, the second assistant of No. 2 furnace, glanced at the steel flowing out in streams, and without a word, took off his work clothes, soaked them in water, and put them on while they were still dripping wet. He snatched a bundle of straw that had been soaked in water, and with a stride, climbed onto the small platform beside the slag outlet. Braving the heat of several hundred degrees, he used a mud-covered straw bundle in each hand, and plunged towards the slag outlet. Other comrades followed closely behind, shoveling one after another. What used to take more than half an hour to handle was now completed in just five minutes. Tian Jiamao jumped down from the platform like a triumphant hero and was immediately surrounded by the steelworkers. Only then did people notice that Tian Jiamao's eyebrows were scorched, and beads of sweat were rolling down his face like rain. Tian Jiamao came to the Third Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the autumn of 1958 to learn steelmaking. After less than two years of training, he was already competent to take on the work of a second assistant. Although he had only experienced one summer's test in front of the open-hearth furnace, he deeply realized that one cannot achieve high production if one cannot withstand the test of high temperatures and overcome them. Therefore, he had long been mentally prepared to accept the second test. Moreover, in this struggle to rescue the steel leakage accident, he created the advanced experience of using straw bundles dipped in refractory mud to block the slag outlet, greatly shortening the processing and rescue time and reducing losses. Now, in the Third Steel Plant, Tian Jiamao's spirit of not fearing difficulties and overcoming high temperatures has become a role model for new workers to learn from. Many new workers who have not yet experienced the summer test are using Tian Jiamao's deeds of overcoming high temperatures as a yardstick to measure and demand of themselves during this hot season.

    第二次考验
    “渣口突击队员们！渣口突击队员们……”正在平炉上夺取高产的丁班炼钢工人们，听到广播器里传出来的急促召唤，人人全神贯注地待命冲锋。“……五号炉出渣口跑钢……”，还没等这句话落音，各炉的二助手像猛虎一般，冲向五号炉的出渣口。二号炉的二助手田家茂，瞧了一眼正在一股一股涌出的钢水，没由分说脱下作业服，放在水里浸了一下，就水淋淋地穿在身上，抢过水浸过的草把子，一个箭步，跨上渣口旁边的小平台，冒着几百度高温，一手一个泥草把子，扑向出渣口。其他同志也一锹紧跟着一锹地干起来。过去需要半个多小时才能处理好的事，这次他们只用五分钟就处理完了。田家茂从平台上一跳下来，就像是凯旋归来的英雄一样，被炼钢工人们团团围住。这时人们才注意到，田家茂的眉毛都被烤焦了，脸上的汗豆像下雨一样，滴滴嗒嗒地滚落下来。田家茂是一九五八年秋天才来到鞍钢第三炼钢厂学习炼钢的，经过不到两年的锻炼已经胜任地担负二助手的工作了。他在平炉前，虽只经过一个夏天的考验，但却深深体会到，不能经受着高温的考验战胜高温，就不能夺得高产，所以他早就作好接受第二次考验的思想准备。并且在这次抢救跑钢事故的斗争中，创造了草把子蘸耐火泥堵出渣口，大大缩短处理抢救时间、减少损失的先进经验。现在第三炼钢厂里，田家茂不惧困难、战胜高温的精神，已经成为全厂新工人学习的榜样，许多还没有经过夏季考验的新工人，在这炎热的季节里，都用田家茂战胜高温的事迹作尺度来衡量和要求自己。（纪）
