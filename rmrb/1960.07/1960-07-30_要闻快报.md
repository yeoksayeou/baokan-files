    **Grasping State Contract Products Firmly**

    Shenyang Fan Factory does everything possible to ensure the completion of state contract orders. When drawing up plans, priority is given to orders from state-owned enterprises; in terms of the supply of materials and tools, priority is given to ensuring the production of state contract products. For state contract products that are particularly urgently needed, the factory adopts the method of "five concessions, one no concession" (concessions on manpower, equipment, materials, tools, and transportation, with no concession on delaying progress) to ensure completion. Because the factory completes its contract tasks on schedule, more than 160 metallurgical, coal, petroleum, chemical, power and other projects supplied with fans by the factory have been able to be put into production on schedule.

    **Vehicle Turnover Campaign Achieves Great Results**

    Staff and workers of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau launched a vehicle turnover campaign in order to achieve high transportation volume and high output. Vehicle turnover requires a vehicle to break through the original requirement of one loading and unloading per day, achieving two loading and unloading, or even more loading and unloading cycles. During the campaign, due to the leadership going deep into the stations and sections, summarizing advanced experiences, and grasping the key to production, significant achievements were made. In the past six months, an average of 8,000 to 9,000 vehicle trips per month have achieved two to seven loading and unloading cycles, ensuring smooth and unimpeded transportation along the line.

    **Maintenance and Repair Forces to the Transportation Front Line**

    In the rush to transport raw materials and fuel centered on coal, the Chengdu Transportation Bureau’s motorcade concentrated automobile maintenance forces on the transportation front line, implementing "on-site maintenance" and "on-site repairs," greatly improving vehicle attendance rates. In order to achieve fast and high-quality repairs, the motorcades generally adopted the method of "assembly interchange": preparing parts in advance, and replacing them as soon as the vehicle arrives, greatly shortening the repair time.

    **Leaders Work at the Furnace to Guarantee Steel with Coke**

    Leading cadres of the Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province went deep into the front line, adopting the method of contracting furnaces and groups, and working with workers to vigorously tackle coke production, "guaranteeing steel with coke," promoting a substantial increase in coke production. In early July, the average daily output of coke reached 157 tons, an increase of 39 percent compared with the average daily output in June, and the quality and coal consumption indicators also met the planned requirements.

    **Mechanical Products Fully Accessorized and Usable**

    The leading departments of the Hefei Municipal Mechanical Industry in Anhui Province have made great efforts to ensure the complete accessorization of products. According to the production equipment and technical conditions of the city’s existing large and small machinery factories, as well as the original production of products, timely adjustments were made in accordance with the requirements of accessorized production: large parts were produced by large factories, small parts were produced by small factories, and finally assembled by one factory. In accessorized production, machinery factories exchanged information, and those with faster progress actively supported those with slower progress. As a result, the tasks of mechanical products were completed on schedule, in good quality and quantity, fully accessorized and usable in the first half of this year.

    **Strengthening Mechanical Equipment Maintenance**

    The Ruqigou Coal Mine in Pingluo, Ningxia, has strengthened mechanical equipment maintenance, greatly improving equipment utilization. From January to June this year, more than 90 percent of the mine’s mechanical equipment reached the excellent maintenance standard, basically achieving no major accidents with mechanical equipment, ensuring reliable normal production. Since the beginning of this year, the mine has overfulfilled its raw coal production plan every month. Recently, the Ningxia Coal Mine Administration held an experience exchange meeting on the maintenance of electrical coal drills and miner's lamps in the whole region, to promote the experience of this mine in mechanical maintenance.

    要闻快报
    狠抓国家订货合同产品
    沈阳扇风机厂千方百计保证完成国家订货合同。在编制计划时，优先安排国营企业的订货；在材料、工具的供应等方面，优先保证国家合同产品的生产。对国家特别急需的合同产品，则采取“五让、一不让”（人力让路、设备让路、材料让路、工具让路、运输让路，不让拖进度）的办法来保证完成。由于这个厂按期完成合同任务，由这个厂供应风机的一百六十多项冶金、煤炭、石油、化工、电力等工程获得了按期投入生产的有利条件。
    车辆翻番运动收效大
    牡丹江铁路局职工为了以高运保高产，大搞车辆翻番运动。车辆翻番就是要求一个车在一天内突破原来要求的一装一卸、达到两装两卸，或更高的装卸次数。在运动中，由于领导深入站段，总结先进经验，狠抓生产关键，因而成绩显著。六个月来，每月平均有八千到九千辆车次达到两装两卸到七装七卸，保证了一条龙运输的畅通无阻。
    保养修理力量到运输第一线
    成都市交通局各汽车队在突击以煤炭为中心的原材料、燃料运输中，集中汽车保修力量到运输第一线，实行“火线保养”和“火线修车”，大大提高了车辆出勤率。各汽车队为了实现快速优质修车，普遍采取“总成互换”的办法：事先准备好配件，车来了马上就换，大大缩短了修车时间。
    领导上炉以焦保钢
    山西省阳泉钢铁厂领导干部深入第一线，采取包炉、包组的办法，和工人一块猛攻焦炭生产，“以焦保钢”，促进了焦炭生产大幅度增长。七月上旬焦炭平均日产量达到一百五十七吨，比六月份平均日产量提高了百分之三十九，质量、煤耗等指标也达到了计划要求。
    机械产品件件配套能用
    安徽省合肥市机械工业领导部门大抓产品配套工作。他们根据全市现有大小机械厂的生产设备和技术条件，以及原来生产产品的情况，及时按照配套生产的要求作了调整：大部件由大厂负责生产，小部件由小厂负责生产，最后由一个厂集中装配。在配套生产中，各机械厂互通情报，进度快的主动支援进度慢的。这样，今年上半年如期按质按量完成了机械产品的任务，件件成套，件件能用。
    加强机械设备维修工作
    宁夏平罗汝箕沟煤矿加强机械设备维修工作，使设备利用率大大提高。今年一至六月份，全矿机械设备达到优秀维护标准的占百分之九十以上，基本上做到了机械设备无大事故，使正常生产得到了可靠的保证。今年以来，这个矿月月超额完成原煤生产计划。最近，宁夏煤矿管理局召开全区煤矿电煤钻、矿灯维护经验交流会，推广了这个矿机械维修方面的经验。
