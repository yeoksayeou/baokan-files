　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd. The Indonesian government has decided to reorganize the locally elected councils. This decision was announced at a meeting of first-level autonomous region (province) local government heads and local council speakers held from June 28th to 30th.
　　According to news released by local news agencies, three committees were established at the suggestion of Minister of Internal Affairs Ipik to discuss ways to change the local government system. Winarso, Ipik's representative, announced the results of the meeting on the 1st, saying, "Ipik made it clear that the reorganization of local councils is the President's instruction, therefore, there is no room for bargaining." President Sukarno said in his speech at the opening ceremony of the meeting that local government bodies must be reorganized.
　　The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on June 25th regarding the reorganization of local councils. The statement said that if the government intends to reorganize local councils, this would mean that it will freeze or dissolve the current local councils and replace them with new local conferences. This will only increase the instability of local governments, so it is not conducive to the implementation of the plans of the central and local governments, and it is also unwise.
　　The statement believes that the local councils elected by the people should continue to work until the end of their term. The statement also believes that cooperative local councils should be established in areas without local councils, only temporary or transitional local councils, to work until the second election of local councils.
　　In the last local council election, the Indonesian Communist Party received the majority of votes.

    印度尼西亚政府根据总统指示
    决定改组选举产生的地方议会
    印度尼西亚共产党主张让地方议会继续工作
    据新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚政府决定改组由人民选举产生的地方议会。这个决定是在一级自治区（省）地方政府负责人和地方议会议长从6月28日到30日举行的会议上宣布的。
    据这里的通讯社发布的消息说，在内政部长伊皮克的建议下，会议成立了三个委员会，讨论改变地方政府制度的办法。伊皮克的代表威纳尔诺1日宣布会议的结果时说，“伊皮克表明，改组地方议会是总统的指示，因此，不可能讨价还价。”苏加诺总统在会议的开幕仪式上讲话时曾说，必须改组地方政府机构。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局6月25日就地方议会改组问题发表了声明。声明说，如果政府打算改组地方议会，这将意味着，它将冻结或者解散目前的地方议会和以新的地方会议来代替它们，这只会加重地方政府的不稳定，因此这不利于实现中央政府和地方政府的计划，这也是不明智的。
    声明认为，应该让人民选举的地方议会继续工作直到任期期满为止。声明并认为，应该在没有地方议会，只有临时或者过渡地方议会的地区成立合作地方议会，工作到选举地方议会第二次选举时为止。
    在上次地方议会选举中，印度尼西亚共产党得到大部分选票。
