Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 10th: The Japanese people today launched their 21st unified action, resolutely demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and opposition to illegal suppression.

According to the unified action plan of the Japan National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," approximately 50,000 people from Tokyo, Kanagawa, Kanto, and other regions held a National Rally near the Atsugi U.S. Military Base in Kanagawa Prefecture, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops and U.S. U-2 aircraft from Japan. The Atsugi base houses U-2 aircraft used by the United States for espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union.

At the rally, Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the "National Conference," representatives from the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and mass organizations, and representatives from local residents spoke in succession.

The rally adopted a declaration and resolution, declaring non-recognition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and demanding that the United States withdraw its troops and U-2 aircraft from Japan.

After the rally, participants demonstrated at the Atsugi U.S. Air Force Base. A delegation from the rally also delivered the rally's resolution to the commander of the U.S. military base.

Meanwhile, in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, the constituency of the traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, people from all walks of life held a National Rally demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The rally passed a resolution stating that reactionary politicians such as Nobusuke Kishi, who were elected from Yamaguchi Prefecture and forcibly "approved" the new "Security Treaty," must be expelled from the Diet.

Afterward, participants demonstrated around the Iwakuni U.S. military base and held a parade in the city.

This unified action, which began today, will last for six days. Tomorrow, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with 3.6 million members, will hold strikes and workplace rallies across the country to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal suppression of workers participating in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and declare the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" invalid.

According to the decision of the "National Conference," on the 14th, representatives from all over the country and workers in Tokyo will hold a mass rally of 200,000 people near the Diet to oppose the establishment of a new cabinet in the style of Nobusuke Kishi, declare the new "Security Treaty" invalid, and protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of participants in the anti-American patriotic struggle.

During this unified action, the Japan National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" and joint struggle organizations in various localities will carry out propaganda and organizational work in rural areas, and launch a signature campaign against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 10th: The interim conference of the Japan Peace Committee successfully concluded today. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution, firmly stating that they will fight to the end to completely smash the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The resolution stated that they will launch a struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty," to strive for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and to strive for the establishment of a government that implements a policy of independence, neutrality, democracy, and peaceful coexistence.

The resolution also stated that in order to achieve the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament, they will strengthen solidarity with the people of the world, and at present, they must strive for the successful holding of the "Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament."

The conference unanimously adopted the future course of action.

The course of action stipulates that they will launch a struggle against the strengthening of armaments and the expansion of military bases, against policies hostile to China and the Soviet Union, against illegal suppression of the people, to defend the Japanese Constitution, and to demand that the United States withdraw its troops from Japan and remove its military bases, and demand the return of Okinawa to Japan.

The course of action stipulates that while carrying out the above-mentioned struggles, they will strive to strengthen the joint struggle organizations of the central and local governments against the "Security Treaty," and consolidate the local organizations of the Peace Committee that have grown rapidly in the struggle. At the same time, it is necessary to expose the essence of the new "Security Treaty" to the broad masses of the people, launch a signature campaign to not recognize the new "Security Treaty," in order to launch a nationwide resistance movement.

The conference decided to send a telegram to Cuban Prime Minister Castro and write a letter to the Cuban Peace Committee to express respect and support for the Cuban people who are waging a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The conference decided to write a letter to encourage the people of Okinawa who waged a heroic struggle against Eisenhower's activities in Okinawa. (Attached picture)
