Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: TASS, Moscow, July 19th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received US Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union Freers on July 19th and delivered the following statement:

“According to a report by the American news agency Associated Press, a US military unit of twenty men landed at the airport in Léopoldville, capital of the Republic of the Congo. According to the same report, US officers emphasized that the arrival of the aforementioned unit was to assist in combat certain countries that had sent troops to the Congo in accordance with resolutions already made by the Security Council.

“The Soviet government deems it necessary to bring to the attention of the US government that the dispatch of the aforementioned US troops to the capital of the Congo is an intolerable act. The Soviet government hereby lodges a protest with the US government and expects the aforementioned troops to be immediately withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of the Congo.

The Soviet government also deems it necessary to declare that if the aforementioned team of US soldiers and officers is not withdrawn, then the Soviet government will have no choice but to draw corresponding conclusions for its own actions as a result.”

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 20th: The US State Department on the 19th quibbled over the Soviet government's statement protesting the US deployment of troops to the Congo. At the same time, increasing numbers of US Army and Air Force personnel continue to infiltrate the Congo.

According to the United States Information Agency (USIA), an official US propaganda organization, US State Department Press Officer White, on the 19th, after Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a statement protesting the entry of US troops into the Congo and demanding the immediate withdrawal of these troops, tried to conceal the aggressive intentions of the US troops entering the Congo, saying that the US soldiers in Léopoldville, the capital of the Congo, were only providing "logistical support" to the UN forces and handling "airlifted emergency food supplies." He also accused the Soviet Union of obstructing the "constructive work" the United Nations was carrying out in the Congo.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Frankfurt, West Germany, on the same day, US "officials estimated today that about fifty US Army and Air Force personnel are now on the ground in the Republic of the Congo," and that this number does not include certain US military personnel who have infiltrated the Congo under the pretext of "transporting supplies" and "evacuating nationals." This American news agency said that the US "Army forces in the Congo are commanded by Lieutenant Consinrano and Lieutenant Wood. The unified coordinator of US activities in the Congo is Colonel Sharpe. All soldiers come from the 7th Army stationed in Germany, while the Air Force comes from the Military Air Transport Service and the 322nd Air Division stationed in Évreux, France."

According to the USIA, a group of US Army pilots, aircraft maintenance personnel, and communications personnel have also infiltrated the Congo.

In addition, the United States continues to send large numbers of US aircraft and military personnel into the Congo under the pretext of "helping UN forces." According to an announcement by the US Department of Defense on the 19th, it has drawn two C-124 aircraft squadrons from Donaldson Air Force Base in South Carolina and sent them to Châteauroux, France, in order to expedite the transport of troops and equipment to the Congo. The US Department of Defense also announced on the 18th that it would supply the UN Command in the Congo with ten C-47 transport aircraft, twenty jeeps, and four thousand steel helmets.

    美国军事人员不断渗入刚果
    苏联提出抗议　美国务院进行狡辩
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯7月19日接见了美国驻苏联临时代办弗里尔斯，并将下列声明交给了他：
    “据美国通讯社美联社报道，为数二十人的一支美国部队在刚果共和国首都利奥波德维尔机场着陆。据同一报道说，美国军官曾强调指出，上述部队的到达是为了在战斗中援助某些国家根据安全理事会已作出的决议而派到刚果来的军队。
    “苏联政府认为有必要提请美国政府注意，派遣上述美国军队到刚果首都是不能容忍的行动。苏联政府为此向美国政府提出抗议，并期待上述军队立即撤出刚果共和国领土。
    苏联政府还认为有必要声明，如果上述这一队美国士兵和军官不撤走，那么，苏联政府将不得不由此而为自己的行动作出相应的结论。”
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院19日就苏联政府抗议美国派兵到刚果的声明进行狡辩。同时，越来越多的美国陆军和空军人员继续渗入刚果。
    据美国官方宣传机构美国新闻处报道，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特19日在苏联外交部长葛罗米柯抗议美国部队进入刚果并且要求这些军队立刻撤走的声明发表后，竭力掩饰美国军队进入刚果的侵略意图，说什么在刚果首都利奥波德维尔的美国士兵只是为了对联合国部队提供“后勤支援”和处理“空运紧急粮食供应”工作。他还反噬苏联阻挠联合国正在刚果进行的“建设性工作”。
    据合众国际社同一天从西德法兰克福发出的消息说，美国“官员们今天估计，约有五十名美国陆军和空军人员现在在刚果共和国的地面服务”，而且，这个数字还不包括借口“运送供应”和“撤退侨民”而打入刚果的某些美国军事人员。这家美国通讯社说，美国在刚果的“陆军部队由康辛拉诺中尉和伍德中尉指挥。美国在刚果的活动的统一调度员是夏普上校。所有士兵都来自驻德国的第七军，而空军则来自军事空运处和驻在法国的埃失勒的第三二二空军师。”
    据美国新闻处透露，一批美国陆军驾驶员、飞机保养人员和通讯人员也已经渗入刚果。
    此外，美国还在“帮助联合国部队”的借口下继续增派大批美国飞机和军事人员进入刚果。据美国国防部19日宣布，它已从美国南卡罗来纳州唐纳逊空军基地抽调两个C—一二四飞机中队派往法国的夏托鲁，以便加紧运送军队和装备到刚果去。美国国防部在18日还宣布，它将供应在刚果的联合国军司令部十架C—47型运输机、二十辆吉普车和四千顶钢盔。
