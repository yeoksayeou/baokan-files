Party Committee Secretary's Notebook

    Make More Close Friends
    Li Zhaorui, Secretary of the Lanji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province
    Since the beginning of spring, Lanji County has mobilized more than 4,000 cadres to go deep into the front lines of production, vigorously engaging in the "four togethers" (eating together, living together, working together, and producing together) and the "four fields" (experimental fields, high-yield fields, command fields, and seed fields). From the First Secretary of the County Party Committee down to ordinary Party members, a campaign to make close friends has been widely launched. Each person makes two or three poor and lower-middle peasants as close friends, thereby effectively improving the work style of cadres, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promoting production surges one after another.
    Making close friends extensively is an important aspect of the Party's mass line work method and a good way to "use a key to open a lock." Forming a system of making close friends with the masses can effectively help leaders discover and solve many key problems in their work, better listen to the opinions of the masses, pool the wisdom of the masses, and lead the production movement more practically. Comrade Chen Yangqiu, First Secretary of the Zhushi Commune Party Committee in our county, went to the Chengjia Brigade in February this year to focus on key areas. Once, while working on wheat cultivation with Cheng Shouting, Old Cheng reflected to Comrade Chen Yangqiu: "If so much early rice is planted this year, the task will not be completed if the spring harvest crops do not mature early." Comrade Chen Yangqiu asked him, "How can we ensure early maturity and high yield?" Old Cheng immediately introduced the method he used the year before to strengthen management, ditch for drainage, and combine frequent application of quick-acting fertilizer with foliar fertilizer. Based on Old Cheng's introduction of this experience, the Commune Party Committee immediately held an emergency meeting to study it and decided to promote it comprehensively. As a result, the entire commune quickly launched a competition for early maturity and high yield of spring harvest crops, vigorously strengthening late-stage management, and promoting the maturity period of more than 4,100 mu of spring harvest crops in the entire commune to be ten days earlier than originally expected, ensuring that 19,311 mu of early autumn rice was transplanted in season. This vivid example shows that making close friends with the masses has a very significant effect on improving work and increasing production.
    Through making close friends, the vast number of cadres have also effectively promoted the rural tool reform movement. Comrade Liu Daben, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Comrade Cheng Liangqing, Secretary of the Xinxu Commune Party Committee, experimented with the use of rice transplanters with their close friends in the third work group of the Xiaqinghan Production Team of the Xinxu Commune. They found that the Type 59 rice transplanter could not transplant short seedlings and that the seedling separation was uneven. Therefore, they immediately conducted on-site research and improvements with technicians and experienced farmers, installing a seedling separation trough under the seedling box, and then working with workers from the machinery factory to modify 27 units. After the modification, not only could it transplant short seedlings, but the seedling separation was even and tidy, without floating roots, greatly improving the quality of transplanting. The commune members praised, "The spring is beautiful in April, men and women, young and old are busy transplanting seedlings. The secretary modified the rice transplanter, which is flexible and easy to use. The failure rate is reduced and the work efficiency is high, even and tidy, and the quality is good."
    Making close friends extensively can also better implement the Party's class policy in rural areas, establish the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, and earnestly implement the Party's policies and guidelines. Xiao Xiandong, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Xinzhui Brigade in Puman Commune, went deep into the first work group of the second production team to make close friends and found that the canteen was not run well and that the commune members had many opinions. Through talking with his close friend, Li Xiang, he learned that the reason the canteen was not run well was that the cook, Lei Yuanyong (old upper-middle peasant), colluded with the production team leader, Lei Yuanming (new upper-middle peasant), to embezzle and privately distribute canteen rice, oil, and vegetables, and the accounts were not published, and they also incited some wealthy households to act recklessly. Later, through two close friends, the masses were mobilized, and a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants was held to organize commune members to speak out, debate, and form a democratic management committee with poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, based on the opinions of the masses. The canteen immediately showed a new atmosphere and was run better day by day. The commune members said, "The public canteen is infinitely good and will never be disbanded." For example, Li Xiangyue, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Dachun Brigade in Guangfa Commune, went deep into the second work group of the second production team and found that the labor attendance rate was not high. He sought the opinion of his close friend, Xiao Shuisheng, and Old Xiao frankly told him that no work points had been recorded since the winter water conservancy construction last year, and some commune members' labor manuals had also been lost by the work point recorder. Based on the information reflected by his close friend, Old Li decisively arranged three evenings to personally lead the commune members to clear the labor work points and mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate a method of "short-term work arrangement, quota-based scoring." The commune members' enthusiasm for production was greatly increased, and the attendance rate also increased. Making close friends extensively has greatly improved the work style of cadres and further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Lei Yanfu, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Fuyuan Brigade in Xinxu Commune, engaged in "four togethers" and made close friends in the third work group of the Fuyuan Production Team. He found that poor peasant commune member Liao Zushui went to work in the rain and was drenched by the drizzle. Old Lei asked him, "Why don't you bring a bamboo hat?" Liao Zushui replied, "One bamboo hat is broken, and another bamboo hat was taken by my wife," and also reflected that some commune members were affected by the lack of rain gear. Old Lei returned to the brigade and immediately convened a meeting of the Party Branch Committee, which decided to allocate 1,400 yuan in cash from the production expenses to purchase rain gear and small farm tools for the commune members. Five days later, more than 190 commune members solved the difficulty of lacking rain gear, and the Party Branch personally bought two bamboo hats and sent them to the home of poor peasant Liao Zushui. Old Liao was so moved that he shed tears. He said to people, "Mother and father are not as close as the Party." The masses reflected, "You are really good cadres of Chairman Mao and close friends of the masses."

    广交知心朋友
    中共湖南蓝嘉县委书记　李兆瑞
    入春以来，蓝嘉县在动员四千多名干部深入生产第一线，大搞“四同”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同生产）“四田”（试验田、丰产田、指挥田、种子田）的基础上，上自县委第一书记，下到一般党员，广泛开展了交知心朋友的运动。每个人交两三个贫农和下中农为知心朋友，从而有效地改进了干部作风，进一步密切了干群关系，促进生产高潮一浪高过一浪。
    广交知心朋友，是党的群众路线工作方法的一个重要方面，是“一把钥匙开一把锁”的好办法。和群众交知心朋友形成一种制度，就能够有效地帮助领导发现和解决许多工作中的关键问题，更好地听取群众意见，集中群众智慧，更加扎扎实实地领导生产运动。我县竹市公社党委第一书记陈杨球同志，今年2月深入成家大队搞重点。有一次和成首庭一起搞小麦培育，老成向陈杨球同志反映说：“今年种那么多早稻，春收作物不提早成熟就会完不成任务”。陈杨球同志问他“要怎样才能提早成熟而又保证高产呢？”老成马上介绍他前年运用加强管理，开沟排水，勤追速效肥和根外追肥相结合的办法。于是根据老成介绍的这一经验，公社党委马上召开紧急会议进行研究，决定全面推广。于是全公社迅速掀起了春收作物早熟高产竞赛运动，大力加强后期管理，促使全社四千一百多亩春收作物成熟期比原来预计提早了十天，保证一万九千三百一十一亩早秋按季节完成了插秧任务。这个生动的事例说明，和群众交知心朋友对于改进工作，提高生产有着非常重大的作用。
    广大干部通过交知心朋友，也有效地促进了农村工具改革运动。县委第一书记刘大本同志和新圩公社党委书记成良清同志在新圩公社下清涵生产队第三作业组和知心朋友们一起试验使用插秧机，发现59型插秧机不能插短秧，分秧不匀，于是马上和技术员及老农进行现场研究和改进，在秧箱下面装上了一个分秧槽，随即与机械厂的工人共同改装了二十七部。经过改装后，不但能插短秧，而且分秧又均匀，又整齐，没有浮蔸，大大提高了插秧质量。社员歌颂道：“四月里好春光，男女老少插秧忙，书记改装插秧机，灵活好使顶呱呱，故障减少工效高，均匀整齐质量好”。
    广交知心朋友，还能更好地贯彻党在农村的阶级政策，树立贫雇农下中农的领导优势，切实贯彻执行党的方针政策。普满公社新坠大队党总支书记萧贤东同志深入到第二生产队第一作业组交知心朋友，发现食堂办得不好，社员有很多意见。通过和知心朋友李香谈心，了解到食堂办得不好的原因是炊事员雷沅勇（老上中农）与生产队长雷沅明（新上中农）勾结起来，贪污私分食堂米、油、菜，账目不公布，还煽动一部分富裕户胡作非为。后来通过两个知心朋友，发动广大群众，召开了贫雇农下中农的会议，组织社员鸣放辩论，根据群众意见成立以贫雇农下中农为核心的民主管理委员会。食堂马上出现了一片新气象，一天比一天办得更好。社员们说：“公共食堂无限好，万古千秋散不了”。再如广发公社大村大队党总支书记李享岳深入第二生产队第二作业组，发现劳动出勤率不高，就向知心朋友萧水生征求意见，老萧坦率告诉他：从去年冬修水利以来，一直没有记过工分，有的社员的劳动手册也给记工员丢了。老李根据知心朋友反映的情况，当机立断，安排三个夜晚的时间，亲自领导社员清理劳动工分，发动群众讨论制订了“短期排工，定额记分”的办法，社员生产积极性大大提高，出勤率也增长了。广交知心朋友，大大改善了干部作风，进一步密切了干群关系。新圩公社富沅大队党总支书记雷衍富在富沅生产队第三作业组搞“四同”，交知心朋友，发现贫农社员廖祖水冒雨出工，被毛雨打得透湿，老雷问他：“为什么不带个?笠呢？”廖祖水回答“一个?笠破了，还有一个?笠我爱人戴去了”，并且反映，有些社员因缺雨具影响了出工。老雷回到大队马上召开党支部委员会，研究决定从生产费内拨出一千四百元现金给社员购置雨具和小农具。五天后，一百九十多个社员解决了缺雨具的困难，党支部还亲自买两个?笠送到贫农廖祖水家里。老廖感动得流出泪来。他对人说：“娘亲爹亲那有党亲。”群众反映说，“你们真正是毛主席的好干部，群众的贴心人。”
