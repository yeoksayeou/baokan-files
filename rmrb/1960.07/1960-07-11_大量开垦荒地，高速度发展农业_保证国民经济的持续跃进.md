    Mass Reclamation of Wasteland and High-Speed Development of Agriculture
　  Guaranteeing a Continuous Leap Forward in the National Economy
　　Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The Land Reclamation Movement Will Fundamentally Change the Face of Qinghai

    Since last winter, the land reclamation movement on the agricultural front in Qinghai Province has swept through every corner and department of the province. In just over six months, more than seven million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, equivalent to the total cultivated area of Qinghai Province. This spring, while continuing land reclamation, a mass sowing campaign was launched. As a result, the sown area of various crops this year has more than doubled compared to last year, laying a solid foundation for the sustained leap forward of agricultural production.

    The distribution of agricultural production in Qinghai Province was originally extremely unbalanced, mainly concentrated in the counties of the eastern agricultural area, which accounts for 10% of the province's area. The vast majority of the pastoral areas, which account for more than 90% of the province's area and have broad prospects and favorable conditions for agricultural development, never engaged in agriculture before liberation. After liberation, although agriculture in pastoral areas has greatly developed, in 1958, the sown area still only accounted for 22% of the province's sown area. The land reclamation movement since last winter has rapidly changed this extremely unreasonable agricultural layout. Not only do all counties in pastoral areas now have agriculture, but many new agricultural bases of considerable scale have also emerged. At present, the sown area of pastoral areas accounts for more than 43% of the province's sown area. If this year's land reclamation task is completed, then the cultivated area of pastoral areas will account for more than 50% of the province's cultivated area. Before long, the past situation of dividing the province into so-called pastoral areas and agricultural areas will become a historical relic. This means that the production landscape of the vast pastoral areas will undergo profound changes: on the one hand, the single and slow-developing animal husbandry economy of ethnic minorities will embark on the development direction of large-scale integration of agriculture and animal husbandry; on the other hand, many large and small state-owned farms using mechanized production will be established. These state-owned farms, scattered like stars across the province, will not only produce a large amount of material wealth for the country, but are also playing an active role in promoting the technical transformation of agricultural and animal husbandry production.

    The development of agriculture and the gradual rationalization of agricultural distribution have created the most important material conditions for the large-scale development of Qinghai Province's rich underground resources. With grain, more people can be moved in, greatly accelerating the comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings in these areas. This is of particularly great significance for the multi-ethnic Qinghai Province. It will greatly accelerate the elimination of the economic and cultural inequalities between ethnic groups left over from history, and enable the ethnic minorities living in pastoral areas to join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups more quickly. Therefore, large-scale land reclamation is not only an economic task, but also a political task; it is not only of practical significance, but also of far-reaching historical significance.

    The great achievements of the land reclamation movement are a great victory for the study and implementation of Mao Zedong Thought. It has once again proven with irrefutable facts the unparalleled power of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, and that the working method of carrying out mass movements and adhering to the mass line is the guarantee for our victory in all undertakings. Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of socialist construction, especially the theory of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, has pointed out a clear direction for us and greatly inspired the revolutionary zeal of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and based on the specific conditions of Qinghai Province, we have begun to find a specific path to accelerate the development of agriculture, and have determined the policy of expanding cultivated area as the main focus, and expanding cultivated area and increasing yield per unit area simultaneously. Qinghai Province is a vast and "poorer and blanker" area. Although it is rich in mineral resources, many places are still wilderness, and no one has ever carried out construction there. All construction undertakings must "start from scratch." Without the development of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and without fundamentally changing the situation of "transporting grain over thousands of miles," the development of socialist construction in Qinghai Province will be greatly delayed. Therefore, adhering to this policy and gradually rationalizing the distribution of agriculture is not only related to the issue of high-speed development of agriculture, but also has a decisive significance for implementing the general line of socialist construction and changing the face of Qinghai as soon as possible. From this, we have a deeper understanding that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon that illuminates our path from victory to victory. Working and solving problems according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible.

    Overcoming Ideological Obstacles and Fighting Against the Worldview of Laziness

    However, in the large-scale land reclamation movement, there are ideological obstacles. Some people are bound by old ideas and old habits, believing that there is no more wasteland to be reclaimed in agricultural areas, and that reclaiming wasteland in pastoral areas will cause conflicts between agriculture and animal husbandry; they believe that Qinghai has a small population and the average cultivated area per person is already quite high, and the labor force is already quite tight, and it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale before mechanization is realized. Some even believe that even if wasteland is reclaimed, it cannot be cultivated well. Others believe that it is impossible to have both more planting and more harvesting, the two cannot be combined. Facts completely negate these views. Obviously, this is a struggle between more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive; a struggle between innovation and conservatism. Not only is there wasteland to be reclaimed in agricultural areas, but the wasteland that can be reclaimed is much more than the existing cultivated land. After just over half a year of large-scale land reclamation, the sown area in agricultural areas this year has increased by more than 50%. This is the most powerful proof. Also, reclaiming wasteland and planting crops in pastoral areas will not only not cause conflicts between agriculture and animal husbandry, but will also greatly promote the development of animal husbandry. The Zhihe Brigade of the Guomaying Commune in Guinan County was a region that used to focus solely on animal husbandry. From 1956, they rationally planned pastures and agricultural areas, reclaiming wasteland and planting crops. By 1959, the average cultivated area per person had reached 9.49 mu, and the grain commodity rate reached more than 37%. As a result of the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, the lives of herders have been greatly improved, livestock have received the necessary feed during the winter and spring when pasture grass is withered, and the livestock breeding rate of the entire brigade in 1959 jumped from an average annual increase of 16.7% in the past to 28.7%, and there appeared a high-yield record of seven flocks of ewes with an average survival rate of 133.35%. Looking at the entire pastoral area, the sown area of various crops this year has increased by 1.8 times compared to last year, but animal husbandry production has increased by more than 20%, creating the highest record in Qinghai Province since liberation. This fully proves that only by developing agriculture and implementing the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry can animal husbandry develop at a high speed, and can animal husbandry production be liberated from the domination and constraints of nature.

    Reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated area requires more labor for agriculture, which is indeed a real problem. Relying on the help of the state and fraternal provinces to increase mechanical equipment is essential. However, what is more important is to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and starting from scratch, starting with accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture to increase agricultural labor productivity. The potential for agricultural technical transformation in Qinghai Province is enormous. According to calculations by the agricultural department, if we promote the tools for cultivating, sowing, managing, harvesting, transporting, and powering that have already been created and imitated successfully throughout the province, we can save 300,000 laborers and increase the total efficiency of agricultural labor by 40%. In this way, coupled with the annual increase in agricultural machinery and equipment, we can not only expand the sown area, but also implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture more deeply and systematically, and achieve more varieties and more harvests, and high yields and more harvests.

    The root cause of the above erroneous ideas is the failure to use one's own brain, not believing in one's own creativity, and not daring to solve difficulties oneself. Obviously, this is the worldview of lazybones and cowards, which has nothing in common with the great ambition of the broad masses to change the face of Qinghai. The experience since the Great Leap Forward proves that if a plan or task fully reflects the needs of objective development, it can stimulate people's fighting spirit and prompt people to work hard to achieve it; conversely, if people do not pay attention to the objective needs of real life and do not propose corresponding tasks or plans, then although the objective conditions for realizing such tasks and plans have long existed, they cannot be discovered and utilized, and people's subjective initiative cannot be greatly developed. This spring, Minhe County completed the task of reclaiming 300,000 mu of wasteland this year with an excess of 120,000 mu in one campaign, making the grain sown area this year reach 1,020,000 mu, an increase of 410,000 mu compared to last year. The objective conditions in Minhe County have not changed much compared to previous years, but because the cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the county have further emancipated their minds and broken superstitions, they have summed up the scientific experience of seizing moisture and sowing early in the struggle to extract more grain from nature, and completed the sowing task of field crops one month ahead of schedule, winning time for more wasteland reclamation, more sowing, and simultaneous wasteland reclamation and sowing; coupled with tool reform and other factors, the county's agricultural production has shown a situation of "early starts lead to a hundred early starts," and everything is active, establishing a bright red flag on the agricultural front. This example once again proves that the contradiction between objective needs and the conditions for realizing objective needs can be resolved through efforts. As long as people correctly understand the objective situation and fully develop their subjective initiative, our work will definitely be able to be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

    The Land Reclamation Movement Must Implement the Policy of "Walking on Two Legs"

    Although our land reclamation work has achieved great achievements, it is only a good start, and it is only the first step on the road to our greater goals. We must not only fully meet the needs of the sustained leap forward of the national economy and the people's lives for grain and other agricultural products, but also have a large amount of grain reserves to meet the needs of larger-scale socialist construction. To this end, while greatly increasing the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land, continuing to reclaim wasteland on a large scale, and striving to increase the cultivated area of Qinghai Province several times on the basis of the existing area within a few years, so that agricultural production can move forward on a larger scale and at a higher speed, is a major task for the Qinghai region for a considerable period of time to come.

    In order to ensure the high-speed and continuous development of the land reclamation movement, we must continue to adhere to the general line of socialist construction, adhere to the spirit of continuous revolution, and conscientiously summarize and promote the experience we have already gained in our work.

    Facts have proven that the land reclamation movement must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and vigorously promote the communist spirit of cooperation. It is not enough to rely solely on the agricultural departments or professional teams for land reclamation. We should mobilize the broad masses of people on all fronts and in all positions. In this way, the movement can gain momentum and unfold vigorously and solidly. The "walking on two legs" of the land reclamation movement means combining mass short-term blitz land reclamation with professional teams' year-round land reclamation, combining large-area land reclamation with scattered small-plot land reclamation, combining on-site land reclamation with expedition land reclamation, combining human and animal power land reclamation with mechanical land reclamation, combining wasteland reclamation with water conservancy construction, and combining mountain land reclamation with mountain management, water management, and soil management. At the same time, we should also mobilize all organs, universities, factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions to reclaim wasteland and plant crops to establish their own farms and non-staple food bases. Qinghai Province has a small agricultural population. Starting from current production, and adapting to the needs of the sustained leap forward of the national economy, the following characteristics will inevitably emerge. At present, in addition to people's communes and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, hundreds of organs and school farms with hundreds of thousands of mu of cultivated land have emerged, and a new landscape of factories running farms and farms running industries has emerged. Facts have proven that the above-mentioned "six combinations" and the three major armies on the agricultural front (people's communes, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, and organ farms) are the main ways to fully develop the enthusiasm of the broad masses, fully mobilize all positive factors, and reclaim wasteland more, faster, better, and more economically. In particular, the participation of the broad masses of workers, students, and their families in agricultural production not only increases a large amount of material wealth for the country, but also plays an active role in eliminating the differences between mental and physical labor, strengthening the ties between the Party and the government and the people, implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, and enabling the worker-peasant alliance to achieve new development in the new historical period. Therefore, these "six combinations" must be adhered to and applied, and cannot be neglected. In addition, it is necessary to actively and vigorously run organ farms, continuously expand the cultivated area, and develop towards the direction of diversified operations, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and grain.

    At present, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in pastoral areas should continue to actively develop in all directions, adopting the method of "hens laying eggs," with old farms contracting to build new farms, large farms leading small farms, and helping new farms and small farms solve difficulties in tools, equipment, and technical force, and gradually establish more farm groups; areas that do not yet have farms but are able to develop agriculture should quickly build farms, establish points, reclaim wasteland, and develop agriculture. There is a lot of wasteland in the mountainous areas of agricultural areas, and we should actively reclaim wasteland and plant crops, develop diversified operations, and vigorously build mountainous areas in conjunction with mountain management, water management, and soil management. The Chuan-Shui areas should overcome the thought of "reaching the top" that there is no more wasteland to be reclaimed, and combine the management of river channels to make full use of the "ten sides" (field edges, slope edges, road edges, ditch edges, river edges, mountain edges, dam edges, house edges, lake edges, reservoir edges) to expand the sown area, so that every inch of land is utilized, and actively organize expedition teams to reclaim wasteland in pastoral areas. To this end, it is necessary to give full play to the communist spirit of cooperation, mobilize all walks of life to support agriculture, vigorously promote mutual assistance between mountains and rivers, and mutual support between agricultural and pastoral areas, continue to adhere to and promote the method of linking factories and communes, and implement the linking of factories and farms, and the linking of farms and communes, so that the strength of all parties can be gathered together, twisted into one rope, and the vast army can contribute to the development of agricultural production.

    Rationally Arrange Labor Force and Seize the Opportunity to Organize Campaigns

    Large-scale land reclamation provides a strong material foundation for the high-speed development of agriculture. Reclaiming one more mu of wasteland this year will increase one more mu of grain next year. Therefore, completing this year's land reclamation task plays a decisive role in the sustained leap forward of agriculture. However, agriculture is an organic whole. After the sown area expands, the labor used for field management, harvesting, threshing, etc. will increase, which requires overall planning and rational arrangement for the use of labor and various tasks on the agricultural front. Neglecting or relaxing any measure to increase yield per unit area is contrary to the purpose of reclaiming wasteland. Since last winter, various localities have seized the opportunity to use the gap in agricultural production to organize campaigns and carry out blitz land reclamation, which is a good method. The benefit of this method is that the direction is clear, the strength is concentrated, the momentum is huge, and the results are significant; it can not only organize all the forces that can participate in land reclamation into the movement, but also promote spring sowing, field management, and other agricultural work to be carried out earlier and better. According to this experience, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee has decided to organize three campaigns for this year's land reclamation movement, namely: the first campaign from after the sowing of field crops to before the busy season of field management; the second campaign from the late stage of field management to before the autumn harvest; and the third campaign from after the autumn harvest to before the land freezes. In this way, various key agricultural tasks on the agricultural front and the land reclamation movement are organically combined, and one campaign is followed by another, continuing to develop. Because Qinghai Province is vast and the distribution of wasteland and the difference in seasons are very large, in the campaign deployment, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, seasons, communes, and farms. The amount of labor used for land reclamation and the length of the campaign should be properly arranged according to the distance of wasteland, the earliness of the season, and the progress of work in the local area, commune, and farm. At the same time, on the premise of not affecting agricultural production in the current year, we must seize every opportunity and race against time to continuously expand the results of the land reclamation campaign. In leadership work, we must seize the opportunity to start early, take the first step and look at the next step, and be down-to-earth in every step. Only by seizing the previous step and speeding up the pace can we create a compelling situation and promote the rapid catch-up of various production links, forming a chain reaction, so that a new situation of you chasing me and being lively and active appears on the production front. At present, various places in the agricultural area have ended the first land reclamation campaign and are focusing on field management. This is a key move to win a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and we should concentrate our efforts to launch a field management movement with high yield as the main focus, criticize and overcome the erroneous idea of ​​"only being able to plant widely, but not being able to harvest more," and firmly grasp the work of weeding, topdressing, watering, pest control and disease eradication, and preventing natural disasters such as hail, frost, and freezing. At the same time, actively carry out land reclamation planning to prepare for the second land reclamation campaign from the later stage of field management to before the autumn harvest. Professional mechanical land reclamation teams and all agricultural and pastoral farms and people's communes with tractors must put all tractors into the land reclamation movement before the autumn harvest. After the annual land reclamation task is completed, we should strive to expand the results of the land reclamation campaign according to the possible conditions of the local area and unit. At the same time, we should launch a water conservancy construction movement before the land freezes. In addition to the key large-scale projects built by the state, prefectures, counties, people's communes, and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should actively build small-scale projects that take effect quickly, have great results, and require less investment; in areas with relatively good water source conditions, we should strive to water the newly reclaimed wasteland this year before spring sowing next year.

    Must Be Closely Integrated with the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement

    The large-scale land reclamation movement requires us to be closely integrated with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Under the current situation where labor and mechanical equipment cannot be greatly increased, we must never wait for the state to send machinery to our door before reclaiming wasteland, as some people think. That way we will miss the opportunity. Our only way out is to "get labor from tools and get time from technology," making full use of existing conditions, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and rapidly improving production capacity and technical level to adapt to the needs of expanding cultivated area and developing agriculture at high speed. At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is booming, and the appearance of production technology is undergoing tremendous changes. On the agricultural front, as of now, more than 600 kinds and more than 510,000 pieces of various production tools have been created, transformed, and imitated. The land leveling machine created by the Xiangride Farm in Qaidam, towed by a small tractor, can level 62.5 mu of land per day, which is equivalent to the workload of 65 people. The five-tooth four-plow created by the Xiligou Commune in Ulan County can reclaim 15 mu of wasteland per day with one person and two animals. The Haomai Commune in Menyuan County and the Heka Commune in Xinghai County, in the case of simple equipment and weak technical force, respectively created animal-powered land reclamation machines, which can reclaim 10 mu of wasteland a day, increasing efficiency tenfold compared with animal-powered plowing. The reform and creation of other tools such as sowing, field management, harvesting, threshing, and transportation are even more colorful and emerging endlessly. Successful experiences in reforming agricultural systems have also emerged. For example: breaking the routine, sowing as soon as the land thaws by one inch; winter sowing of spring wheat; reclaiming wasteland and sowing simultaneously, and so on. Facts have proven that these reforms of the agricultural system are good ways to develop agricultural production at high speed. Timely advance spring sowing and winter sowing of spring wheat, which advance the entire agricultural production season by dozens of days, not only have a positive effect on overcoming the spring drought in Qinghai and avoiding natural disasters such as autumn flooding, hail, and freezing, but also win time for multiple plantings, greatly improving people's ability to understand and control nature. However, at present, the development of the movement is still very uneven, and a few people have insufficient understanding of the significance of realizing the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of agriculture, and are content with the status quo. Some successful creations have not been timely compared, identified, and quickly promoted. These erroneous ideas and shortcomings in the movement must be corrected and resolved in a timely manner to promote the continuous upsurge of the movement.

    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we should closely combine with current production, pay attention to concentrating efforts to solve key problems in current production, and overcome weak links. In the land reclamation movement, in addition to the professional mechanical land reclamation teams and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms owning a part of the tractors, there are a large number of human and animal-powered land reclamation. Therefore, first grasping the land reclamation link and striving to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization as soon as possible is of great significance for ensuring the continuous leap forward of agriculture. Of course, we must also actively reform the tools used for field management, harvesting, threshing, etc. These aspects cost a lot of labor. If the labor productivity is improved, more manpower will be invested in the land reclamation movement. Therefore, we must not only formulate short-term plans for the current weak links, focusing on key production problems, so as to ensure the early completion of the production plan; but also formulate comprehensive plans to transform agricultural technology and improve production capacity, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution in agriculture can be fully unfolded and continuously developed.

    The land reclamation movement that is unfolding before us is a greater and more arduous task than last year, and it is a revolutionary battle against nature. To win this battle, we must first carry out ideological revolution, adhere to putting politics in command, and adhere to vigorously carrying out mass movements. Ideological work is the soul of all work. Work is done by people, and people's ideology is to be expressed in work. It can be seen that, under certain objective conditions, the quality, speed, and efficiency of work depend on the ideology and work style of the leading cadres. It is impossible to imagine that a lazybones or coward who is mentally depressed and dare not think or do in the face of difficulties can do amazing things. Therefore, we should treat all tasks with a fearless spirit, not be arrogant or impatient, not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, carry forward the communist style of combining daring to think and do with scientific analysis, always maintain vigorous revolutionary zeal in the face of every new task, go deep into the front line of production, grasp ideological work, grasp weak links, grasp the present, and also grasp the coming year, grasp the production progress, and also grasp the project quality. Make careful arrangements, implement them at all levels, and turn the land reclamation task into the actions of the broad masses of workers, staff, farmers, and herders. Where there are difficulties, there must be leading cadres sitting in charge. At the same time, in the movement, we must care about the lives of the masses, and in accordance with the principle of "combining labor and rest," arrange the production and life of the masses in a unified manner, and treat ensuring the rest of the masses as a political task, just like ensuring production. Only in this way can the masses be more full of spirit and more energetic. It can be fully believed that the people of all ethnic groups and the broad masses of workers who have already won a great victory in the winter of last year and the spring of this year will be able to continue to exert their efforts and complete the glorious task of reclaiming wasteland this year ahead of schedule and with exceeding the quota with the spirit of continuous revolution.

    大量开垦荒地，高速度发展农业
　  保证国民经济的持续跃进
　　中共青海省委第一书记　高峰
    垦荒运动将从根本上改变青海的面貌
    去年冬季以来，青海地区农业战线上的垦荒运动，席卷全省每一个角落和部门，仅仅半年多一点的时间，就开垦了七百多万亩荒地，相当于青海全省耕地面积的总和。今年春季，与继续垦荒同时，又开展了全民性的播种运动，因此今年各种作物播种面积比去年增长一倍以上，这就为农业生产的持续跃进打下了巩固的基础。
    青海省原来的农业生产分布极不平衡，主要集中在占全省面积10％的东部农业区各县，而占全省面积90％以上、并且有着发展农业的广阔前途和优越条件的绝大部分牧业区，在解放前从来不经营农业。解放以后，牧业区的农业虽然有了很大发展，但是到1958年，播种面积也还只占全省播种面积的22％。去年冬季以来的垦荒运动，使这种极不合理的农业布局迅速地发生了变化，在牧业区不但县县有了农业，而且还出现了许多具有一定规模的新的农业基地。现在牧业区的播种面积已经占全省播种面积的43％以上。如果今年的垦荒任务完成以后，那么牧业区的耕地面积将占全省耕地面积的50％以上。不要多久，过去把全省划分为所谓牧业区和农业区的情况，将成为历史陈迹。这就是说，辽阔的牧业区的生产面貌将发生深刻的变化：一方面，少数民族的单一的发展缓慢的畜牧业经济，将走上大规模的农牧结合的发展方向；另一方面，将建立起许多使用机械生产的大大小小的国营农场。这些星罗棋布的国营农场，不仅能为国家生产大批的物质财富，而且对促进农牧业生产的技术改造已经和正在起着积极作用。
    农业的发展、农业分布的逐步合理化，为大规模地开发青海省富饶的地下资源，创造了最重要的物质条件。有了粮食，就能移进更多的人口，大大加快这些地区的工业、农业、牧业和文教卫生事业的全面发展；这对多民族的青海省来说，具有特别重大的意义。它将大大加速消除历史上遗留下来的各民族之间在经济、文化上的不平等状态，使聚居在牧业区的各少数民族更快地跻于先进民族的行列。因此，大规模地开垦荒地，不仅是经济任务，而且是政治任务；不仅具有现实意义，而且具有深远的历史意义。
    垦荒运动所取得的巨大成就，是学习和贯彻执行毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它又一次以不可辩驳的事实证明了在社会主义建设总路线指导下出现的大跃进和人民公社的无比威力，证明了大搞群众运动、坚持群众路线的工作方法是我们取得一切事业胜利的保证。毛泽东同志关于社会主义建设的理论，特别是国民经济以农业为基础的理论，给我们指出了明确的方向，大大地鼓舞了青海省各族人民的革命干劲。在毛泽东思想的指导下，根据青海省的具体情况，我们开始摸到了一条加速发展农业的具体道路，确定了以扩大耕地面积为主，扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量并举的方针。青海省是一个面积辽阔、“更穷更白”的地区，尽管蕴藏着极为富饶的矿藏资源，但是许多地方还是一片荒野，从来没有人在那里进行过建设，各项建设事业都要“平地起家”。如果没有作为国民经济基础的农业的发展，不从根本上改变“千里运粮草”的局面，就会大大延缓青海省社会主义建设事业的发展。因此，坚持这条方针，使农业的分布逐步合理化，不仅仅牵涉到高速度发展农业的问题，而且对贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，尽快地改变青海面貌有着决定的意义。从这里，我们更深刻地体会到毛泽东思想是照耀我们从胜利走向胜利的灯塔。按照毛泽东思想来进行工作，解决问题，我们就会无往而不胜。
    克服思想阻力，同懒汉的世界观作斗争
    但是，在大规模的垦荒运动中，并不是没有思想阻力的。有些人受旧思想、旧习惯的束缚，认为农业区已经没有什么荒地可开了，在牧业区垦荒会引起农牧矛盾；认为青海人口少，平均占有的耕地面积已经相当高了，劳动力已经相当紧张了，在没有实现机械化以前是不可能大规模地开垦荒地的。甚至认为：即使开出荒地，也是无法种好的。还有些人认为，要多种就不可能多收，两者不可兼得。事实完全否定了这些看法。显然，这是多快好省同少慢差费的斗争，革新同守旧的斗争。农业区不仅有荒可开，而且可开垦的荒地比现有耕地都要多得多。仅仅经过半年多大规模的垦荒运动，今年农业区的播种面积就增长了50％以上。这就是最有力的证明。还有，在牧业区垦荒种地不但不会引起农牧矛盾，而且还大大促进了畜牧业的发展。贵南县过马营公社直核大队，过去是一个单纯经营畜牧业的地区，从1956年开始，他们合理地规划了牧场和农作区，垦荒种地，到1959年已经达到平均每人占有耕地九点四九亩，粮食商品率达到37％以上。实行农牧结合的结果，大大改善了牧民的生活，使牲畜在冬春牧草枯黄季节得到了必需的饲料，使全队1959年的牲畜增殖率由过去平均每年增加16.7％一跃而为28.7％，并且出现了七群母羊繁殖成活率平均达到133.35％的高产纪录。就整个牧业区来看，今年各种作物播种面积比去年增加一点八倍，但是畜牧业生产却增长了20％以上，创造了青海省解放后的最高纪录。这就充分证明了，只有发展农业，实行农牧结合，才是高速度发展畜牧业的方向，才能使畜牧业生产从自然界的支配和束缚下解放出来。
    开垦荒地、扩大耕地面积，需要更多从事农业的劳动力，这的确是一个现实问题。依靠国家和兄弟省的帮助，增加机械设备，这是必不可少的。但是，更重要的是发扬白手起家、自力更生的精神，从加速农业的技术改造入手，提高农业劳动生产率。青海省农业技术改造的潜力极大，据农业部门的计算，如果我们把全省已经创造、仿造成功的耕、播、管、收、运和动力等方面的工具加以推广，就可以节约出三十万个劳动力，使农业劳动总工效提高40％。这样，加上农业机械设备的逐年增加，我们不仅能够扩大播种面积，而且能够更深入更系统地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，实现多种多收，高产多收。
    上述错误思想的根源，就是不开动自己的脑筋，不相信自己的创造能力，不敢动手自己解决困难。显然，这是懒汉和懦夫的世界观，同广大群众迫切要求改变青海面貌的雄心壮志毫无共同之处。大跃进以来的经验证明，一个计划或任务，如果充分反映了客观发展的需要，那就能够激发人们的斗志，能够促使人们努力去把它实现；相反，如果人们不去注意现实生活的客观需要，不提出相应的任务或计划，那么，尽管实现这种任务和计划的客观条件早就有了，但也不能被发掘出来，加以利用，而人的主观能动性也就不能大大发挥。民和县今年春季一个战役就超额十二万亩完成今年垦荒三十万亩的任务，使今年粮食播种面积达到一百零二万亩，比去年增加四十一万亩。民和县的客观条件同往年并没有多大变化，只是由于全县干部和各族人民进一步解放思想，破除迷信，在向大自然索取更多的粮食的斗争中，总结出抢墒早播的科学经验，提前一个月完成了大田作物播种任务，为多垦荒、多播种，边垦荒、边播种赢得了时间；加上工具改革及其他因素，使全县农业生产出现了一早百早、事事主动的局面，在农业战线上树立了一面鲜明的红旗。这个事例再一次证明，客观需要和实现客观需要的条件之间的矛盾，经过努力，是可以解决的，只要人们正确认识客观情况，充分发挥主观能动作用，我们的工作就一定能够搞得多快好省。
    垦荒运动必须执行“两条腿走路”的方针
    尽管我们的垦荒工作已经取得了巨大成就，但还只是一个良好的开端，同我们更大的目标来比较，还只是迈开了前进道路上的第一步。我们不仅要充分满足国民经济持续跃进和人民生活对粮食和其他农产品的需要，而且必须要有大量的粮食储备，以迎接更大规模的社会主义建设。为此，在大大提高现有耕地单位面积产量的同时，继续大规模地开垦荒地，争取在几年内，把青海省的耕地面积在现有基础上增加几倍，使农业生产以更大的规模、更高的速度向前迈进，是青海地区今后相当长的时间内的重大任务。
    为了使垦荒运动高速度地持续发展，必须继续坚持贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，坚持不断革命精神，认真地总结和推广工作中已经取得的经验。
    事实证明，垦荒运动必须坚决地贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，大兴共产主义协作之风。垦荒工作仅仅依靠农业部门、依靠专业队伍是不行的，应该把各个战线、各个岗位上的广大人民群众都动员起来。这样，运动才能形成声势，才能既轰轰烈烈、又扎扎实实地展开。垦荒运动的“两条腿走路”，就是群众性的短期突击垦荒和专业队长年垦荒相结合，大面积垦荒和零星小块垦荒相结合，就地垦荒和远征垦荒相结合，人畜力垦荒和机械垦荒相结合，开垦荒地和兴修水利相结合，山地垦荒和治山、治水、治土相结合。同时，还应该动员所有机关、高等院校和厂矿企业、事业单位垦荒种地，建立自己的农场和副食品基地。青海省农业人口少，从当前生产出发，适应国民经济持续跃进的需要必然出现这样的特点。现在，农业战线上除了人民公社、国营农牧场以外，已经出现了几百个拥有几十万亩耕地的机关、学校农场，出现了工厂办农场，农场办工业的新景象。事实证明，上面所说的“六结合”和农业战线上的三支大军（人民公社、国营农、牧场和机关农场），是充分发挥广大群众积极性、充分调动一切积极因素、多快好省地开垦荒地的主要途径。特别是广大职工、学生和家属参加农业生产，不仅为国家增加了大量的物质财富，而且对于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，密切党和政府同人民群众的关系，贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使工农联盟在新的历史时期获得新的发展，都起了积极的作用。因此，这“六结合”必须坚持运用，不可偏废。此外，要积极大办并且办好机关农场，不断扩大耕地面积，向多种经营的方向发展，逐步实现蔬菜、肉食、粮食三自给。
    现在，牧业区的国营农牧场应该继续积极向四周发展，采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，老场包建新场，大场带动小场，帮助新场、小场解决工具、设备、技术力量等方面的困难，逐步建立更多的农场群；现在还没有农场而又能够发展农业的地区，应该迅速建场、安点，开垦荒地，发展农业。农业区的山区，荒地很多，应该结合治山、治水、治土，积极垦荒种植，发展多种经营，大力建设山区。川水地区应该克服已经无荒可开的
  “到顶论”思想，结合治理河道，充分利用“十边”（田边、坡边、路边、沟边、河边、山边、坝边、屋边、湖边、水库边。）扩大播种面积，做到寸土不闲，并且积极组织远征队到牧业区去垦荒。为此，必须发挥共产主义协作精神，动员各行各业都来支援农业，大力提倡山川互助，农牧业区相互支援，继续坚持和推广厂社挂钩的办法，并且实行厂场挂钩、场社挂钩，使各方面的力量都汇聚在一起，拧成一股绳，千军万马，都为发展农业生产而贡献力量。
    合理安排劳动力，抓紧时机组织战役
    大规模的开垦荒地，为高速度发展农业提供了雄厚的物质基础。今年多开一亩荒，明年就能多增加一亩地的粮。因此，完成今年的垦荒任务，对农业的持续跃进起着决定的作用。但是，农业是一个有机的整体，播种面积扩大后，用在田间管理、收割打碾等方面的劳动力就增多，这就要求对劳动力的使用和农业战线上的各种工作，进行统筹兼顾，合理安排；忽视或放松了提高单位面积产量的任何一个措施，都是同开垦荒地的目的相违背的。去年冬季以来，各地抓紧利用农业生产的空隙，不失时机地组织战役，突击垦荒，是一个好办法。这个办法的好处是：方向明确、力量集中、声势浩大、收效显著；既能把一切可以参加垦荒的力量组织到运动中来，又推动了春播、田间管理和其他农活进行得又早、又好。按照这个经验，对今年的垦荒运动，中共青海省委决定组织三个战役，即：大田作物播种以后到田间管理大忙以前为第一个战役；田间管理后期到秋收以前为第二个战役；秋收以后到土地结冻以前为第三个战役。这样，就使农业战线上的各种关键性的农活和垦荒运动有机地结合起来，一个战役接着一个战役，持续地发展下去。由于青海省地区辽阔，荒地的分布和季节的差别都很大，所以在战役部署中，必须因地、因时、因社、因场制宜。开垦荒地所使用的劳动力数量，战役时间的长短，都应该按照本地、本社、本场的荒地远近，季节迟早，工作进度，妥善安排。同时，在不影响当年农业生产的前提下，要以见缝插针、分秒必争的精神，不断扩大垦荒战果。在领导工作上，必须事事抓早，走上步、看下步，步步踏实。只有抓紧了前一步，加快速度，才能造成逼人的形势，推动各个生产环节也迅速赶上去，形成连锁反映，使生产战线上出现你追我赶、生动活泼的新局面。现在，农业区各地已经结束了第一个垦荒战役，中心转向田间管理，这是夺取今年农业大丰收的具有关键性的一着，应该集中力量，掀起以丰产方为纲的田间管理运动，批判和克服那种“只能广种，不能多收”的错误思想，狠抓拔草、追肥、浇水、除虫灭病和预防冰雹、霜冻等自然灾害的工作。与此同时，积极地进行垦荒规划，为田间管理后期到秋收以前的第二个垦荒战役作好准备工作。专业机械垦荒队和一切拥有拖拉机的农牧场、人民公社，在秋收以前必须把全部拖拉机投入垦荒运动。在全年垦荒任务完成以后，应该根据本地区、本单位的可能条件，尽力扩大垦荒战果。同时，要在土地结冻以前掀起一个兴修水利运动，除国家修建的重点大型工程外，州、县、人民公社和国营农牧场，应该积极兴建见效快、收效大、投资少的小型工程；在水源条件比较好的地区，要力争把今年开垦的荒地在明年春播以前浇上头水。
    必须同技术革新和技术革命运动密切结合
    大规模的垦荒运动，要求我们必须紧密结合技术革新和技术革命运动。在当前劳动力和机械设备都不可能大幅度增长的情况下，绝不能像某些人所想的那样，等待国家把机械送上门来，然后再开垦荒地。那样我们就会坐失良机。我们的出路只能是“向工具要劳力，向技术要时间”，充分利用现有条件，发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，把生产能力和技术水平迅速地提高一步，以适应扩大耕地面积，高速度发展农业的需要。现在，技术革新和技术革命运动正在蓬勃发展，生产技术面貌正在发生巨大变化。农业战线上，截至目前，已经创造、改造和仿造各种生产工具六百余种、五十一万余件。柴达木香日德农场创造的平地机，用小型拖拉机牵引，每天能平整土地六十二点五亩，相当于六十五人的工作量。乌兰县西里沟公社创造的五齿四铧犁，一人二畜每天可以开荒十五亩。门源县浩迈公社和兴海县河卡公社，在设备简陋、技术力量薄弱的情况下，分别创制了畜力垦荒机，一天能垦荒十亩，比畜力拉犁提高工效十倍。其他如播种、田间管理、收割、脱粒、运输等工具的改革和创造，更是万紫千红，层出不穷。改革农业制度的成功经验也出现了。例如：打破常规，土地解冻一寸就播种；春小麦冬播；边开荒、边播种，等等。事实证明，这些农业制度的改革，都是高速度发展农业生产的好办法。适时地提早春播和春小麦冬播，使整个农业生产季节提前了几十天，不仅对战胜青海地区春季干旱和避免秋季涝、雹、冻等自然灾害有着积极作用，而且为多种地赢得了时间，大大提高了人们认识自然，驾驭自然的能力。但是，目前运动的发展还很不平衡，有少数人对实现农业的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的意义认识不足，安于现状。有些成功的创造，还没有及时地进行评比、鉴定，迅速推广。这些错误思想和运动中的缺点，都必须及时改正和解决，以促使运动不断高涨。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，应该紧密结合当前生产，注意集中力量解决当前生产关键问题，克服薄弱环节。在垦荒运动中，除了专业机械垦荒队和国营农牧场拥有一部分拖拉机以外，大量的还有人畜力垦荒。因此，首先抓住垦荒这个环节，力求尽早地实现机械化、半机械化，对保证农业持续跃进有着重大意义。当然，对用于田间管理、收割、碾打等方面的工具，也必须积极进行改革。这些方面所费的劳动很多，如果把劳动生产率提高，那就会有更多的人力投入垦荒运动。因此，既要制定针对当前薄弱环节的短期规划，主攻生产关键，以便保证提前完成生产计划；又必须制定改造农业技术，提高生产能力的全面规划，使农业上的技术革新和技术革命全面展开，不断发展。
    展现在我们面前的垦荒运动，是一个比去年更伟大、更艰巨的任务，是一场向大自然进行革命的战斗。要取得这场斗争的胜利，必须首先进行思想革命，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动。思想工作是一切工作的灵魂。工作是由人去做的，而人的思想意识是要表现在工作上的。由此可见，在一定的客观条件下，工作的好与不好、快与慢，是决定于领导干部的思想意识和工作作风的。不能设想，一个精神萎靡、在困难面前不敢想、不敢干的懒汉、懦夫，能够做出惊人的事迹来。因此，我们应该以大无畏的精神对待一切任务，不骄不躁，不满足于已经取得的成绩，发扬敢想敢做和科学分析相结合的共产主义风格，在每一个新的任务面前永远保持旺盛的革命干劲，深入生产第一线，抓思想工作，抓薄弱环节，抓当前，也抓来年，抓生产进度，也抓工程质量。周密安排，层层落实，把垦荒任务变为广大职工和农牧民群众自己的行动。要做到哪里有困难，哪里就有领导干部坐镇。同时，在运动中，要关心群众生活，根据“劳逸结合”的原则，统一安排群众的生产和生活，把保证群众的休息像保证生产一样，当做政治任务来看待。只有这样，才能使群众的精神更加饱满，干劲更加充沛。可以完全相信，在去年冬季和今年春季已经赢得了伟大胜利的各族人民和广大职工，一定能够继续鼓足干劲，以不断革命的精神，提前并且超额完成今年开垦荒地的光荣任务。
