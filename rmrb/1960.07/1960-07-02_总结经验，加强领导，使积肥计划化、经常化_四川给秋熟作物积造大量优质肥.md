Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu — Sichuan's rural areas are systematically accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer to provide ample fertilization for major spring crops.

The regularization and planning of fertilizer accumulation and production represent a new development in Sichuan's rural areas in addressing fertilizer issues this year. Many localities have summarized and promoted the "six implementations" method from past experiences, which includes determining fertilizer demand, sources, tasks, labor, quotas, and schedules. This approach begins with investigation and research, clarifying the amount of fertilizer needed for each major spring crop, the timing of fertilization, and various fertilizer sources through inspections and detailed calculations. A specific plan for fertilizer accumulation, production, transportation, and application is then formulated based on existing fertilizer quantities, and labor is appropriately arranged to continuously carry out mass movements.

Sichuan is focusing on pig raising for fertilizer accumulation, extensively producing green manure, utilizing some winter crop straw for composting, massively creating soil-based fertilizer, and combining patriotic health campaigns to accumulate various natural fertilizers to broaden fertilizer sources and ensure plans are grounded in reality. With temperatures rising, localities are seizing the opportunity to collect and compost green manure in large quantities. Many areas are extensively engaging in mixed composting and artificial liquid manure production using grass, leaves, and some winter crop straw.

Various localities have established specialized fertilizer accumulation and production teams, adopting methods such as regular accumulation by specialized teams, mobilizing the masses to squeeze in time for concentrated accumulation, accumulating less during busy periods and more during less busy periods to resolve labor conflicts. Many improvements have also been made in working methods. First, the fertilization schedules for various crops are prioritized in order, and then collection, composting, and transportation are carried out separately based on urgency. To save labor and reduce labor intensity, Chongqing County's people's communes have widely adopted the method of collecting green manure locally, processing it locally, and applying it locally, which has proven very effective. While assigning fertilizer accumulation and production tasks to production teams, breeding farms, and fertilizer plants, labor quotas are also established, implemented down to the individual, and competitions are held to evaluate and reward those who exceed quotas with high quality and efficiency. In the Guanghan County’s Lianglukou People's Commune's evaluation and competition, members who exceeded the quota by more than 20% were given certain material rewards, which fully stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer.

Chengdu, July 1st -- The Leshi County Fangsheng Commune in Sichuan Province has implemented the "six implementations" method in its fertilizer accumulation work for major spring crop field management, ensuring the fertilization of various crops. By the end of June, early rice had been top-dressed twice, mid-season rice once, cotton and corn once each, and sweet potatoes were being prepared for their first top-dressing; minor crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, tobacco, hemp, melons, and beans had also been top-dressed once or twice. Not only was the amount of fertilizer applied each time greater than in previous years, but it was also applied more promptly.

The Fangsheng Commune is rich in grain and cash crops, with as many as fifteen types of major spring production crops. Competition for fertilizer among crops is very serious, often resulting in neglecting one for the sake of another. Since last year, the commune has gradually strengthened the planning of fertilizer accumulation, production, and application, making comprehensive arrangements by crop and season, and implementing them at every step. In this year's major spring field management fertilizer accumulation, they summarized last year's experiences and developed them, systematically summarizing them as the "six implementations," requiring that they achieve: accumulate as much as needed; have whatever fertilizer is needed; deliver it whenever needed. The specific practices of the six implementations are:

1.  Implement the quantity and quality of fertilizer needed. The commune party committee announced to the members the number of times top-dressing was to be applied to various crops, the amount of fertilizer needed, and the quality of fertilizer. For example, based on this year's high-yield targets, calculated using three-in-one manure as the standard, rice, corn, and sweet potatoes generally require three top-dressings, and cotton requires six top-dressings. The commune's major spring crop field management requires a total of more than six million loads of fertilizer. Once the quantity and quality of fertilizer needed are implemented, both cadres and members have a clear understanding and a clear goal to strive for.

2.  Implement fertilizer sources. Based on the existing pig manure and the production volume of the six soil-based fertilizer plants, the commune calculated that there was still a shortage of more than 3.7 million loads during the field management period. Where would the missing fertilizer come from? After mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and strategies, the commune resolved the fertilizer shortage problem from the following four aspects: (1) Improving the existing pig raising, fertilizer production can be increased by 20%; (2) Converting all commune canteen kitchens into "oxtail stoves" for smoking fertilizer; (3) Collecting green manure; (4) Expanding the six fertilizer plants and building a new small fertilizer plant to expand production; this basically solved the fertilizer shortage problem.

3.  Implement tasks. The commune party committee formulated fertilizer accumulation, production, and application tasks based on the fertilizer needs of various crops and the distribution of fertilizer sources, assigned them to production teams, breeding farms, and fertilizer plants, requiring them to be completed on time and with quality, and strictly implementing an inspection and acceptance system. At the same time, the commune also carried out some basic construction, adopting a method of assigning fertilizer fields to important crops by number.

4.  Implement labor. The commune extracted 610 members to form a fixed specialized fertilizer accumulation team, ensuring that the fertilizer accumulation work always maintained a certain amount of labor. At the same time, mass concentrated fertilizer accumulation movements were carried out regularly. Since April, the commune has carried out seven large-scale concentrated fertilizer accumulation movements.

5.  Implement quotas. Fertilizer accumulation and production quotas were formulated separately according to labor grades and fertilizer accumulation projects, and the fertilizer accumulation and production quotas were assigned to individuals, and inspection, evaluation, and over-quota competitions were carried out. In the most recent commune-wide over-quota fertilizer accumulation competition, 1,000 people broke the quota, and more than 160 people were commended and rewarded by the commune.

6.  Implement time. The time for fertilizer accumulation, production, and application is closely linked. Preparing for the later stage of top-dressing while applying the early stage of top-dressing; preparing for the top-dressing of late-sown crops while applying the top-dressing of early-sown crops; considering the fertilizer for the next season's crops while applying the fertilizer for the last season's crops. It is required to achieve overall planning, careful arrangement, and a close link between each step. For example, according to the needs of various major spring crops, the commune concentrated on accumulating fertilizer for two to three consecutive days in late May, ensuring the fertilizer needs for top-dressing in early June, and concentrated on accumulating fertilizer for two to three days in early June to prepare fertilizer for top-dressing in mid-to-late June. The previous few times focused on accumulating nitrogen fertilizer, while the later few times paid attention to accumulating more potassium and phosphorus fertilizer, striving to accumulate more and use it well.

    总结经验，加强领导，使积肥计划化、经常化
    四川给秋熟作物积造大量优质肥
    新华社成都讯　四川农村正在有计划地积肥造肥和运肥，为大春作物提供充足的肥料。
    积肥造肥经常化、计划化，是今年四川农村在解决肥料问题上的一个新的发展。许多地方从历年经验中总结推广了需肥数量、肥源、任务、劳动力、定额、时间“六落实”的办法。首先从调查研究入手，通过检查和算细账，摸清各项大春作物所需的肥料数量、用肥时间和各种肥源，并参照已有的肥料数量，制订出积肥造肥运肥用肥的具体计划，妥善安排劳动力，持续地开展群众运动。
    四川各地都以养猪积肥为中心，大积青肥，利用部分小春作物秸秆沤肥，大造土化肥，结合爱国卫生运动积造各种自然肥等等来广开肥源，使计划建立在可靠的基础上。目前气温日渐升高，各地正抓紧时机大量采积和沤制青肥。许多地区都利用青草、树叶和部分小春作物秸秆大搞混合堆肥人造水粪。
    各地都建立积肥造肥专业队，采取专业队经常积造、发动群众挤时间突击积造，大忙小积造、小忙大积造等办法解决劳动力的矛盾，并且在工作方法上作了许多改进。首先是把各项作物用肥的时间按先后次序逐一排队，然后根据缓急分别采集、沤制和运送。崇庆县为了节省劳动力，减轻劳动强度，各人民公社普遍采取就地采青、就地处理、就地施用的办法，效果很好。各地在把积肥造肥任务落实到生产队、饲养场和肥料厂的同时，都制订了劳动定额，落实到人，并开展超定额高质量高工效评比竞赛。广汉县两路口人民公社在评比竞赛中，对于超额完成定额20％以上的社员给予一定的物质奖励，充分激发了群众积肥造肥运肥的积极性。
    本报成都1日电　四川省乐至县放生公社在为大春作物田间管理积肥的工作中，实行了“六落实”的办法，使各种作物的追肥都有了保证。到6月中止，早稻已施追肥两次，中稻施追肥一次，棉花和玉米已施过一次，甘薯正准备施第一次追肥；小宗作物如甘蔗、花生、烟、麻、瓜、豆等作物也都施过一次到两次追肥。每次追肥不仅数量比往年多，施得也比较及时。
    放生公社盛产粮食和经济作物，大春生产中大小宗作物就有十五种。作物之间争肥很严重，经常发生顾此失彼的现象。从去年以来，该社逐步加强了积肥造肥用肥的计划性，按作物按季节全面安排，处处落实。今年大春田间管理积肥中，他们总结了去年的经验，并加以发展，系统地归纳为“六落实”，要求作到：要多少积多少；要啥肥有啥肥；啥时要，啥时到。六落实的具体作法是：
    一、需肥的数量质量落实。公社党委将各种作物施追肥的次数、需肥数量和质量，向社员公布。如根据今年的高产指标，以三合粪为标准计算，水稻、玉米、红苕一般追肥三次，棉花追肥六次，全社大春作物田间管理共需肥六百多万挑。需肥的数量质量落实后，使干部和社员都心中有底，奋斗目标明确。
    二、肥源落实。全社以现有的猪肥和六个土化肥厂的生产量计算，在田间管理期中，尚差三百七十多万挑。缺少的肥料从哪里来？全社经过发动群众献计献策，从以下四个方面解决缺肥问题：（1）养好现有猪只，出肥量可增加20％；（2）全社食堂灶房改成牛尾灶熏肥；（3）采集青肥；（4）扩建六个化肥厂，新建一个小型化肥厂，扩大生产；这样就基本解决了缺肥问题。
    三、任务落实。公社党委根据各种作物需肥量和肥源分布情况，制定出积肥造肥用肥任务，落实到生产队、饲养场和化肥厂，要求按时按质量完成，严格检查验收制度。同时，该社还进行了一些基本建设，对于重要作物采取肥田对号的办法。
    四、劳力落实。全社抽出六百一十个社员组成固定的积肥专业队，使积肥工作经常保持有一定的劳力。同时定期开展群众性的突击积肥运动。从4月份以来，全社已开展七次规模巨大的突击积肥运动。
    五、定额落实。分别劳力等级和积肥项目，制定积肥造肥定额，并把积肥造肥定额分别定到人，开展检查评比和超定额竞赛。最近一次全社性的超定额积肥竞赛运动中，有一千人突破定额，一百六十多人受到公社表扬和奖励。
    六、时间落实。把积肥造肥和用肥的时间紧密衔接起来。施前期追肥，即准备后期追肥；施早种作物追肥，即准备迟种作物追肥；施上季作物肥，即考虑下季作物肥。要求作到统筹规划、周密安排，一环紧扣一环。如该社根据各种大春作物需要，5月下旬连续突击积肥二至三天，保证了6月上旬追肥需要，6月上旬又突击积肥二至三天，为中、下旬追肥准备肥料。前几次以积氮肥为主，后几次注意多积钾磷肥，争取积得多，用得好。（附图片）
