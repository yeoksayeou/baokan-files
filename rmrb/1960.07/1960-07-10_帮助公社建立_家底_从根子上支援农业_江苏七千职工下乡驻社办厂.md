Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - Industrial departments in ten cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Xuzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Xin Hai Lian, and Huaiyin, have conscientiously implemented the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation." Since the beginning of this year, they have adopted the method of "coordinated dispatch to the countryside," sending a total of 7,605 industrial cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to reside in communes and actively develop county and commune industries that serve agriculture, accelerating agricultural technological transformation.

"Coordinated dispatch to the countryside" means sending everything, from cadres and technical personnel to equipment. The technical contingent from the ten cities in Jiangsu Province has carried thousands of pieces of equipment for producing agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to the countryside this year. These personnel are generally sent to neighboring counties; in addition to sending personnel to support the rural areas under their jurisdiction, Nanjing and Wuxi have also sent more than 1,300 people across the Yangtze River to settle in Yangzhou, Yancheng, Huaiyin, Nantong and other regions to support the "catching up with the South" of northern Jiangsu. The main task of the technical contingent sent to the countryside is to help develop county and commune industries serving agriculture locally, taking full responsibility from building factories, installing equipment, and training technicians to improving management systems.

The activity of "coordinated dispatch to the countryside" to support agriculture in these ten cities developed on the basis of the widespread factory-commune pairing. In the first quarter of this year, 7,689 factories and enterprises in the province's cities were paired with rural people's communes (including some schools and hospitals paired with communes), forming a new situation of "factory-commune pairing forming lines, and urban-rural cooperation connecting into networks" throughout the province. After the factory-commune pairing, local Party committees also organized employees to visit the countryside, invited commune cadres to give reports in factories, and conducted political classes to make cadres and employees deeply realize that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and that industrial support for agriculture is not only to promote the overall leap forward in agricultural production, but also to realize the great leap forward in industrial production and the entire national economy. At the same time, urban industrial leading departments and factories and mines sent special personnel to the countryside to help the paired areas and communes formulate plans for agricultural technological transformation, and sent cadres, technical personnel, and equipment to the countryside to help communes develop industry and build a "foundation." The Party committees of various cities submitted the plans for supporting agricultural technological transformation to the employees for discussion, and issued the call for "cadres going to the countryside, technology going to the countryside, equipment going to the countryside, and style going to the countryside." Many factories launched a surge of registration to go to the countryside.

After the technical contingent from various cities arrived in the counties and communes, they immediately joined local cadres and commune members in the battle to accelerate agricultural technological transformation, demonstrating the noble communist style of the working class and a high degree of responsibility for supporting agriculture. They all lived and ate with local cadres and commune members and worked together. Guo Fengzu, deputy director of the workshop of Wuxi Machine Tool Factory, served as the director of the Agricultural Machinery Factory in Xuyi County, Huaiyin Prefecture. On the first day of arriving at the factory, he worked alongside the workers, learning about the overall situation of the factory while working. He found that the quality of the castings of the harvester was not high, and immediately held a Zhuge Liang meeting with the workers to study and develop improvement measures. Ka Changtai, a worker at the Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory, and He Zhengxiang, a worker at the Nanjing Bearing Factory, went to the Nongju Factory of Zhenghong Commune in Binhai County, and participated in agricultural labor in the fields on the same day, soliciting farmers' opinions on agricultural tools for several consecutive days. After returning to the workshop, they worked with other workers to brainstorm ways to improve agricultural tools.

The "coordinated dispatch to the countryside" by urban industrial departments further strengthened the Party's leadership over county and commune industries and improved the enterprise management of county and commune industries. According to the situation of county and commune factories, the cadres sent by Changzhou City promoted a set of political work experience such as political classes, "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and labor competitions to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over county and commune industries. The cadres and managers sent by various cities also helped county and commune factories establish necessary planning management, production scheduling, and team accounting systems. At the same time, through the activity of "coordinated dispatch to the countryside," the technical strength of county and commune industries was rapidly strengthened, the technical level was improved, and the production capacity was expanded. The 113 technicians sent by Changzhou City to Wujin County trained 1,025 apprentices for county and commune factories within three months. Due to the strengthening of technical strength and the increase of equipment, many county and commune factories have been able to perform medium and even major repairs on agricultural machinery from only being able to perform minor repairs; and have developed from being able to only repair to being able to both repair and manufacture. Through the "coordinated dispatch to the countryside" activities, the worker-peasant alliance was further strengthened. Commune peasants in the Nantong area reflected: "The workers have style, and we also have ambition. Industry strongly supports agriculture, and we must also strongly support industry."

### 帮助公社建立“家底”　从根子上支援农业  江苏七千职工下乡驻社办厂

    帮助公社建立“家底”　从根子上支援农业
    江苏七千职工下乡驻社办厂
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省南京、无锡、常州、苏州、徐州、南通、镇江、新海连、淮阴等十个城市的工业部门，认真贯彻执行“以农业为基础”的方针，今年以来采取“配套下乡”的办法，先后派出了工业干部、技术人员、技术工人共七千六百零五人下乡驻社，帮助各地积极发展为农业服务的县社工业，加速进行农业技术改造。
      “配套下乡”就是从干部、技术力量到设备，连人带马一齐出动。江苏省十个城市今年派往乡村的技术大军，总共携带了生产农业机械、化肥农药等产品的各种设备几千台。这批人员一般都派往邻县农村；南京、无锡两市除派人支援所属辖区农村外，还派出一千三百多人，跨过长江到扬州、盐城、淮阴、南通等专区落户，支援苏北“赶江南”。各地技术大军下乡的任务主要是就地帮助发展为农业服务的县社工业，从建厂、安装设备、培训技工到健全管理制度包干到底。
    这十个市“配套下乡”支援农业的活动，是在厂社普遍挂钩的基础上发展起来的。今年第一季度，全省各市与农村人民公社挂钩的工厂企业就有七千六百八十九个（其中包括部分与公社挂钩的学校、医院），在全省范围内形成了“厂社挂钩串成行，城乡协作连成网”的新局面。厂社挂钩以后，各地党委又通过组织职工群众下乡访问、邀请公社干部到厂作报告，以及上政治课等方法，使干部和职工群众深切地认识到农业是国民经济发展的基础，工业支援农业不仅是为了促进农业生产全面跃进，而且也是为了实现工业生产和整个国民经济的大跃进。同时，城市工业领导部门和厂矿企业都派出专人下农村，帮助挂钩的地区和公社制订农业技术改造的规划，并输送干部、技术力量和设备下乡，帮助公社发展工业，建立“家底”。各市党委把支援农业技术改造的规划交职工群众讨论，发出了“干部下乡、技术下乡、设备下乡、风格下乡”的号召，许多工厂掀起了报名下乡的热潮。
    各市支援农业的技术大军到达县社以后，立即和当地干部、公社社员一起，投入了加速农业技术改造的战斗，表现出工人阶级高尚的共产主义风格和对支援农业高度负责的精神。他们都和当地干部、社员吃住在一块、劳动在一起。无锡机床厂车间副主任过凤祖，到淮阴专区盱眙县农业机械厂担任厂长，到厂第一天，就和工人并肩干活，边干活边了解全厂情况。他发现收割机铸件质量不高，马上和工人开诸葛亮会议，研究出了改进措施。南京晨光机器厂工人卡长台、南京轴承厂工人何正祥，到滨海县正洪公社农具厂以后，当天就到田头参加农业劳动，一连数天征求农民对农具的意见，回到车间后就和其他工人一道动脑筋想办法改进农具。
    城市工业部门“配套下乡”，进一步加强了党对县社工业的领导，改进了县社工业的企业管理。常州市下乡的干部根据县社工厂的情况，推行了上政治课，“两参一改三结合”、劳动竞赛等一套政治工作经验，加强了党对县社工业的政治思想领导。各市下乡的干部和管理人员，还帮助县社工厂建立必要的计划管理、生产调度、班组核算等制度。同时，通过“配套下乡”的活动，迅速壮大了县社工业的技术力量，提高了技术水平，扩大了生产能力。常州市派到武进县去的一百一十三个技术工人。在三个月内，就为县、社工厂培养了徒工一千零二十五人。由于技术力量加强、设备增多，许多县、社工厂在农业机具的生产上，由只能小修到中修以至大修；由只能修理发展到既能修又能造。通过“配套下乡”的活动，进一步加强了工农联盟。南通地区公社农民反映：“工人有风格，我们也有志气，工业大力支援农业，我们也要大力支援工业。”（附图片）
