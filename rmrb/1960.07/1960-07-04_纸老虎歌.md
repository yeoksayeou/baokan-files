Paper Tiger Song
Wu Han

I. Expel the Plague God
Greedy American imperialism, appointing itself world police, consistently brandishing its fangs and claws, establishing bases everywhere, frantically suppressing the people, cruelly massacring women and infants, its mouth full of "peace" and "justice," a painted demon. Using both overt and covert means, plotting and creating wars, setting fires everywhere, its evil deeds now fully exposed. Like a rat scurrying across the street, everyone shouts "Kill it!" Shut behind closed doors, it tastes the bitter dregs. Our country uses cannons to "welcome and send off," the tiger revealing its true form, a paper-mâché and bamboo-frame beast, a clay sculpture and wooden carving ghost. As long as the people are united, distinguishing clearly between friend and foe, twisting into a single force, a roar sounding like thunder, shattering everything under our iron fists, where can the plague god flee? Eliminate imperialism, safeguard lasting peace, the world's future is bright, bravely advancing without ceasing, continuing the struggle with renewed vigor, the east wind blowing across the vast ocean.

II. Thief's Backbone
Before the summit conference, it intentionally stirred up trouble, dispatching a U-2 plane, entering our house freely, conducting aerial photography and reconnaissance, wanting all our military installations, equipped with silent pistols and poison, foreign currency and watches, in case it was shot down, killing people to silence them and deny everything. The Soviet Union's rockets were truly accurate, a thunderous strike retaliating, the wreckage and surviving pilot serving as proof, making it hard to escape world opinion. At first, it categorically lied, claiming it was a weather research objective, but faced with irrefutable evidence, it was left speechless, forced to clamor arrogantly: espionage is a national policy, decided by the president, a habitual thief doesn't steal or rob, how can it sit idly? Blaming the Soviet Union for maintaining secrecy, rather than admitting American trickery, admitting that sending spies is my act, claiming it's a form of self-defense, not only have we sent them in the past, but we will send them many times in the future. Thievery is thievery, how can you plead for leniency after being caught? The nature of a thief is completely exposed, the ugly form meticulously described, making a fool of itself before the world, confessing its crimes upon being challenged, the whole world pointing to it as a war criminal, triggering an anti-imperialist upsurge.

III. Scattering Monkeys
In the West, there's Mendes, in the East, there's Syngman Rhee, two American lackeys, with the same face and mouth, flattering their masters' intentions, doing their best to expand armaments and prepare for war, plundering the people's wealth, massacring countless lives, suppressing the democratic tide, willingly offering up sovereignty, running rampant and committing evil for many years, arousing the resentment of men, women, and children, uniting in demonstrations, strikes, and market boycotts constantly, overthrowing the traitorous regime, fearing no beheadings or bloodshed? Wave after wave rising higher, the entire people will settle the score, hearing the wind rustling the trees, every sound taken for an enemy soldier, their masters panic-stricken, in a moment of crisis, each flees for his own life, abandoning their lackeys, one escaping to America to live, one waiting for judgment in prison, leaving behind a stench for eternity, unable to escape the people's law! A withered tree is shaken by the wind, before it falls, the monkeys scatter, hastily offering solace, forlornly sighing in the air, a hundred-foot ladder hanging in the air; scaring the lackeys into a sweat, rocks, fists, and bullets, they can only cower and flee like rats.

IV. Cold Shoulder
Japan's Nobusuke Kishi, originally an American lackey, a notorious war criminal, locked up in Sugamo Prison, eager to please his master, signing the US-Japan Security Treaty, selling out the country and harming the people at heart, caring nothing for the people's welfare, hitching onto the American imperialist war chariot, coveting the Soviet and Chinese mainland, the wounds of Hiroshima not yet healed, the suffering of the survivors touching the eyes, how can we endure another war, factories and homes collapsing again. The whole country is united in striving, protesting and demonstrating chasing after him, workers, peasants, businessmen, and students coming together, millions of signatures connected in a banner, surrounding the Diet and shouting, using wooden sticks and water cannons in a struggle, risking injury to save the country, national mourning outweighs family mourning? Six million people on strike, continuing the effort without shrinking back, if the traitorous treaty is not abolished, the Kishi cabinet will not quickly fall, Hagerty met with bad luck, the American plague god frowned, forcing a calm appearance and coming eastward, his heart heavy and full of thoughts, wanting to go but hesitant to stop, anxious and troubled, worrying and fearing, the traitorous lackeys are worried, in case they ruin their Uncle, trying to steal a chicken only to lose the rice, hurting the harmony between master and servant, gritting his teeth and requesting, unable to receive him with embarrassment, being offered a cold shoulder to eat, the plague god's courage waning and soul falling, the angry tide rising higher and higher, the lackey descending from power with a bowed head, plotting to revive the corpse with someone else's soul, unable to escape the ears and eyes of the masses; the people's power is boundless, taking advantage of the victory to pursue and wish success from afar!

V. "Welcoming and Sending Off" Song
Bombing Jinmen and Matsu, anti-American armed demonstrations, those who "visit" come with ill intentions, plotting evil and wrongdoing. Issuing proclamations in advance, warning and severely punishing those who disturb, the patriotic people of Taiwan and Penghu, deeply understand the crisis of division, the motherland is thriving and leaping forward in the present era, uniting to resist the enemy, how can we allow robbers to command? American imperialism is deploying troops in the straits, recklessly going against the tide, occupying our territory for ten years, its crimes known throughout the world, Dulles died and Eisenhower continues,妄想台澎分离, seeing through the plot of詭計,
"Welcoming and Sending Off" has its own etiquette, destroying the American embassy, a glorious record of patriotism, progressing further, the struggle should be resolute, Japan and Korea rising up, both can serve as teachers, despising and scorning American imperialism, this is the right time to beat the dog, the people of the motherland are the backing, supporting the artillery "welcoming and sending off", may the mountains collapse and the rocks shatter, do not risk danger carelessly, anti-American propaganda should be widespread, everyone should recognize its painted skin, the days of American imperialism are numbered, welcoming fathers and elders to return, build quickly, well, and economically, who but heroes can accomplish this?

VI. Strong East Wind
The people of the world are united, their struggles sharing common interests, puncturing the paper tiger, the east wind prevailing over the west wind.

    纸老虎歌
    吴晗
    一、逐瘟神美帝贪婪成性，自封世界宪兵，一贯张牙舞爪，基地到处经营，疯狂镇压民众，残酷屠杀妇婴，满口“和平”“正义”，涂脂抹粉妖精，明枪暗箭齐用，阴谋制造战争，到处放烟点火，今朝恶贯满盈，老鼠过街喊打，闭门滋味残羹，我国打炮“迎送”，老虎现出原形，纸糊竹扎野兽，泥塑木雕幽灵。只要人民团结，是友是敌分明，拧成一股力量，吼声响似雷霆，铁拳下处粉碎，奔逃何处瘟神？消灭帝国主义，保卫持久和平，世界前途大好，奋勇前进不停，斗争再接再厉，东风吹遍沧溟。
    二、贼骨头最高会议前朝，蓄意要把祸挑，派出飞机U二，登堂入室逍遥，空中摄影侦察，军事设备都要，无声手枪、毒药，外国钞票、手表，万一被人打下，杀人灭口赖掉。苏联火箭真准，雷霆一击报销，残机活人作证，世界公论难逃，开头矢口撒谎，气象研究目标，宣布铁证哑口，只好蛮横叫嚣：特务间谍国策，总统定下规条，惯贼不偷不抢，安坐岂非无聊？都怪苏联保密，不是美国放刁，派遣特务是我，这是自卫之道，不但过去派遣，今后还来几遭，做贼就是做贼，破案岂可讨饶？贼性完全托出，恶形自己细描，世界面前出丑，罪行一打便招，全球共指战犯，掀起反帝高潮。
    三、猢狲散西方曼德列斯，东方有李承晚，两个美国奴才，一般模样嘴脸，奉承主子意图，尽力扩军备战，搜刮民脂民膏，屠杀生灵千万，镇压民主潮流，主权甘心奉献，横行作恶多年，男女老幼愤怨，团结一致示威，罢工罢市不断，推翻卖国政权，断头流血何惮？一浪一浪更高，全民要把账算，风声鹤唳皆兵，主子心惊胆战，事急各奔前程，撇下奴才不管，一逃美国偷生，一在班房候判，留得万世臭名，难逃人民刑宪！枯树遭风动摇，未倒猢狲先散，仓皇亲自抚安，凄凉临空长叹，长梯百尺悬空；吓得奴才出汗，石头拳头弹头，只好抱头鼠窜。
    四、闭门羹日本的岸信介，原是美国奴仆，战犯赫赫有名，关在巢鸭监狱，巴得主子欢心，订结美日条约，卖国害民居心，那管苍生祸福，拴上美帝战车，窥伺苏中大陆，广岛疮疾未平，遗黎伤心触目，何堪再起战争，工厂民居倾复。举国一致力争，抗议示威追逐，工农商学齐来，千万签名连幅，包围国会高呼，木棍水龙相扑，救亡那怕受伤，家哭何如国哭？六百万人罢工，再接再厉不缩，卖国约不废除，岸内阁倒不速，哈格蒂触霉头，艾瘟神眉头蹙，强装镇静东来，心事重重满腹，欲行欲止踌躇，忐忑为难栗六，卖国奴才发愁，万一坏了阿叔，偷鸡不着蚀米，伤了主奴和睦，咬紧牙关请求，不便接待惶恧，闭门羹请吃之，瘟神胆丧魂落，怒潮越起越高，奴才下堂穹蹙，阴谋借尸还魂，难逃万众耳目；人民力量无穷，乘胜再追遥祝！
    五、“迎送”曲炮轰金门马祖，反美武装示威，“访问”来者不善，阴谋作恶为非。事先发布文告，扰乱严惩勿违，台澎爱国民众，深知分裂危机，祖国蒸蒸日上，跃进当代所希，团结一致拒敌，岂容强盗指挥？美帝陈兵海峡，猖狂倒行逆施，十年占我领土，罪恶举世皆知，杜勒斯死艾继，妄想台澎分离，识破阴谋诡计，
  “迎送”自有礼仪，捣毁美国使馆，爱国纪录光辉，百尺竿头进步，斗争坚决为宜，日本朝鲜奋起，两者皆可为师，鄙视蔑视美帝，打狗此正其时，祖国人民后盾，放炮“迎送”支持，命中山飞石烂，切莫自冒倾危，反美宣传普遍，人人识破画皮，美帝日子不久，欢迎父老来归，多快好省建设，英雄舍我其谁？
     六、东风劲世界人民团结，斗争利害相同，戳破纸糊老虎，东风长压西风。
