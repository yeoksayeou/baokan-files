The US government, after stifling the Four-Power Summit with open acts of aggression and provocation, is now exploiting its failure to intensify international tensions and frantically engage in arms expansion and war preparations. In the two months since the summit collapsed, American military and political leaders and propaganda machines have incessantly clamored for strengthening the "military strength" of the US and the West to counter the Soviet Union, demanding the development of "ultra-modern weapons." They have even openly threatened to "prepare for war." As the British "Daily Herald" described it: "A torrent of war talk has seized America."

This makes it even clearer that the disruption of the Four-Power Summit was a step in America's accelerated war preparation plan. It is remembered that on the eve of the summit, Eisenhower, in a letter to the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Group at the Istanbul meeting, said that if the summit negotiations were unsuccessful, "we will have more reason" to "maintain our strength." The American ruling group clearly believes that it has created a "reason" to step up arms expansion and war preparations.

Shortly after the summit failed, American news agencies revealed that the Eisenhower administration would "step up its full-line defense" and "accelerate efforts to offset the Soviet Union's advantage in developing rockets and space weapons." Eisenhower also eagerly announced that in order to deal with the situation after the summit, "we must maintain our strength and maintain it for a long time." At that time, American military leaders were even more desperately clamoring that the collapse of the summit "pointed out in the strongest possible way" the "extreme importance" of strengthening the "defense" of the United States and "the entire world." They clamored that the US must develop "new and more advanced" weapons. Imperialist scientist Teller, hailed as the American "father of the hydrogen bomb," even advocated that the US must spend "tens of billions of dollars" to develop space weapons and nuclear weapons, so as to have the power to "destroy" the Soviet Union. In order to accelerate the development of such a military aggression force, the US has recently intensified the testing of "Atlas," "Polaris," and "Bomarc" missiles. On June 20, the US Strategic Air Command for the first time test-fired the "Minuteman" missile launched from a moving train. The US Department of Defense has ordered the acceleration of the construction of "Atlas" missile launch sites. In just nine days from June 30 to July 8, the US launched eight missiles, almost one per day on average. On July 17, the US Department of Defense brazenly announced that the US would conduct eleven underground nuclear explosion tests in the next two years. At the same time, a wave of increased military spending has swept across the United States. The US government has repeatedly urged Congress to increase military appropriations. During the debate on increasing military spending in the House of Representatives and the Senate, New York Governor Rockefeller, a giant of American monopoly capital, and Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also repeatedly demanded a significant increase in military expenditures. American arms monopoly capital even called the failure of the summit an "economic stimulant" and actively promoted new military orders. Under this fervor of arms expansion, the US Congress passed a military appropriation bill for the 1961 fiscal year on June 30, allocating nearly $40 billion, which is $660 million more than Eisenhower originally requested. These increased military expenditures will be used specifically to develop spy satellites and nuclear power potential, launch "Polaris" missile submarines, and increase the modernization of the army's weapons. On July 1, the US House of Representatives also passed a bill appropriating nearly $1 billion to expand military bases around the world.

After destroying the summit, the US, under the guise of "close unity," strengthened its military aggression group, further coercing and driving its "allies" to step up arms expansion and war preparations together with the US. Not long ago, US Secretary of State Herter repeatedly clamored: "Today's international climate emphasizes the necessity of maintaining unity and strengthening the strength of our alliance." Eisenhower also advocated that it is necessary to "ensure that its allies stand on our side." The US immediately convened a special meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in Paris the day after the summit broke down. US State Department spokesman White said that the North Atlantic Group's ten-year arms expansion plan is about to be implemented. At the end of May, the US held a meeting of foreign ministers of the eight member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Washington, demanding that "allies" cooperate with the US in carrying out aggressive activities in the Far East. After the meeting, the Southeast Asia Group also sent people to "strengthen ties" with the Central Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Group. At the same time, British Defense Minister Watkinson went to Washington to hold talks with US Defense Secretary Gates, claiming that the two countries had decided to jointly "test-produce" the US "Lightning" medium-range missile for equipping the bombers of the two countries. They also discussed the issue of the US equipping the North Atlantic Group forces with "Polaris" missiles. Soon, West German Defense Minister Strauss also rushed to the United States to discuss ways to purchase nuclear missiles from the United States to accelerate West Germany's atomic armament. Western news agencies revealed that the US is even planning to lift some restrictions of the Paris Treaty on West Germany's manufacturing of modern weapons. US Army Secretary Bruck has been carrying out activities in West Germany this month, planning to arm West German troops with US medium-range ballistic missiles and conspiring to help West Germany build 1,000-ton nuclear submarines and 5,000-ton destroyers capable of launching nuclear missiles. At the same time, the West German Ministry of Defense announced that West Germany had built its first "Nike" missile company near Bonn. In early June, the United States and its eight North Atlantic Group "allies" decided to establish a "research center" to prepare for submarine warfare. Recently, a US Department of Defense spokesman revealed that the US plans to set up 300 "Polaris" medium-range missiles in Western Europe. The Canadian "Pacific Tribune" on June 30 also revealed that the US is building nuclear missile bases in northern Canada targeting China and the Soviet Union.

In the past month or so, with the rise of the anti-American storm among the people of Asia, the United States has also particularly intensified the creation of tense situations and military provocations in the Asian region. After the US sabotaged the summit, it immediately directed the Kishi Nobusuke group to use force to illegally "pass" the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Not long ago, the US and the Kishi Nobusuke group, regardless of the strong opposition of the vast majority of the Japanese people, brazenly exchanged treaty "ratification documents." This fully exposed the US imperialist conspiracy to accelerate Japan's rearmament and prepare for a war of aggression. The meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Southeast Asia Group held in Washington from May 31 to June 2 was another provocation by US imperialism against peace in the Far East. At the meeting, the US planned new aggression plans in Laos, South Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and the Taiwan Strait, and decided to further expand the military planning organization based in Bangkok. The final communique of the meeting more deliberately stated that it would "pay special attention" to "the intensification of subversion, rebellion, and terrorist activities by the Communists in several countries in the treaty area," attempting to interfere in the national democratic movement in the region. In order to cooperate with the convening of this Southeast Asia Group meeting, 120 US Air Force aircraft conducted large-scale exercises in Southeast Asia. At the same time, the United States has also continuously strengthened its war preparations deployment in the Far East. US Army Secretary Bruck and Army Chief of Staff Lemnitzer revealed in their testimony to Congress that the US military had long formulated a "general plan for war in Southeast Asia." US Air Force Secretary Sharp openly threatened that the US and its "allied" air forces in the Far East were "ready" and "have been on alert." In early June, a US "special combat team" with modern equipment was sent to Okinawa to prepare for "small wars" in the Western Pacific region. In order to further suppress the anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the people of Asian countries and stabilize the US's aggression front in the entire Asia, US President Eisenhower hardened his head and went to the Far East to carry out activities. To cooperate with this bandit trip, the US Seventh Fleet and the US forces invading Korea conducted provocative military exercises in South Korea and the Taiwan Strait. Due to the resistance and heroic struggle of the people of Asia, especially the Japanese people, this plague god's trip to the Far East suffered a great failure. But US imperialism is not reconciled to failure, and it is currently struggling to intensify new aggression deployments in the Far East. The US Navy has decided to send more missile-equipped warships to operate in the Western Pacific. The US has begun to equip the Philippine Air Force with "Sidewinder" missiles and is planning to accelerate the equipment of the Thai army with modern weapons. From July 1, the US forces invading Korea and the South Korean puppet army conducted a 15-day "hypothetical war" exercise for the army, navy, and air force. On July 9, the US forces invading Korea brazenly conducted a firing exercise with "Honest John" rockets and atomic bomb simulations. At the same time, the US is increasing its military strength in South Korea. According to the US "Newsweek" published on July 12, the US is transporting 8,000 US troops to South Korea. On the same day, the "United Nations Command" spokesperson publicly acknowledged this fact. In addition, according to the "New York Times," 3,000 of the US's increased invasion troops have arrived in South Korea.

While the US ruling group is trying its best to strengthen arms expansion and military activities, it does not hide its purpose in doing so: to prepare for a new war of aggression. On May 19, US Strategic Air Command Commander Power said in a speech: "We have both the determination and the readiness to fight." On May 24, US Chief of Naval Operations Burke said in a speech: "Weapons and armies must be able to cope with any situation; the need for a full-scale thermonuclear war, a limited war, or a show of force in some troubled area." On June 10, US Vice President Nixon openly clamored: The "conflict" between the US and the Soviet Union "may be resolved by war." On June 25, US Commander in Korea Magruder said: "There will still be limited wars like the Korean War in the world." On June 18, US Defense Secretary Gates clamored in a speech: The US now has "a good military plan," and "our combat readiness is beyond question." On the 26th, he also clamored: "We are militarily prepared and sound, and can cope with small-scale wars and large-scale wars." On July 14, US Army Secretary Bruck clamored that the US invading forces stationed in Europe are "in a state of constant combat readiness." US Air Force Chief of Staff White has also recently unabashedly shouted that the US intends to launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union.

In order to step up war preparations, the US ruling group has frantically intensified the Cold War, created tensions, and repeatedly provoked socialist countries. Just two months after the US U-2 spy plane invaded the Soviet Union, the US RB-47 reconnaissance plane invaded Soviet airspace again, carrying out shameless provocations. On July 19, Eisenhower held a "Cold War" strategy meeting with Herter and other senior officials, planning actions to further intensify the tense situation. The US is also holding so-called "Captive Nations Week" this week, which provokes socialist countries and frantically promotes the subversion of socialist countries.

The propaganda machines of the US and its accomplices have falsely claimed that all these intensified arms expansion and war preparations clamors and activities of the US government are the result of what "reassesses the policies in the Cold War initiated by the Soviet Union." This is complete nonsense. In fact, the US government's arms expansion, war preparations, and "Cold War" activities have never stopped for a moment. Before the Four-Power Summit, the US government stepped up the development of missiles and the establishment of missile bases in the name of "strengthening deterrence." The US has also been strengthening the war preparation activities of its military groups, and rearming West Germany and Japan, reviving the militarist forces of these two war hotbeds. The US has also never given up carrying out aggressive provocations against socialist countries. At the same time, the US still occupies our country's Taiwan and is intensifying the creation of a tense situation in the Far East. Eisenhower's broadcast speech on May 25 clearly stated: "Our own policies have not changed." "We have not relaxed our vigilance as we prepared for this meeting (referring to the Four-Power Summit)." US Secretary of State Herter said even more bluntly. He openly declared not long ago: Dulles's "brink of war" policy "has continued to guide us" and "serve us." This clearly shows that the US has been carrying out arms expansion and war preparation activities. If there is any difference between the recent past and the past, it is only that the US previously put on a "peace" disguise, and now it is doing it more brazenly under the guise of "dealing with the Soviet threat."

As everyone knows, in the past period, the US was playing the trick of "false peace and true war preparations." In order to buy time to save its military decline, the US ruling group tried its best to spread a smoke screen of false peace to paralyze the people of various countries, but in fact, it actively carried out arms expansion and war preparations under the cover of this smoke screen. As we have long pointed out, this two-faced approach of the US cannot last long, because it itself has insurmountable contradictions. Since the US wants to step up war preparations, it cannot but tear down its trick of false peace. For example, while the US pretended to be willing to resolve international disputes through negotiations, it could not stop the provocative activities of espionage flights to the Soviet Union on the eve of the Four-Power Summit. Finally, the US's false peace trick was completely exposed, and Eisenhower's "peace" cloak was torn to pieces. As a result, the US re-sounded the drums of intensifying the tense situation, and carried out arms expansion and war preparation activities under the cover of the tense situation. From the perspective of the American ruling group, doing so would be more willful. Of course, even in such circumstances, the leading figures of the United States did not give up their pretense of that "peaceful" posture, but their keynote has obviously changed. The US ruling group is now trying its best to use the so-called "Soviet Union's resumption of the Cold War policy" that has been fabricated out of nothing as an excuse for intensifying war preparations. This approach of the United States can only make the people of various countries more clearly recognize the bellicose face of US imperialism and prompt all peace-loving people to be more vigilant.

    美国制造紧张局势加紧扩军备战
    席林生
    美国政府以公开的侵略挑衅扼杀了四国首脑会议之后，正在利用首脑会议的流产加紧制造国际紧张局势，疯狂地进行扩军备战的活动。从四国首脑会议失败后的两个多月来，美国军政领袖和宣传机器，不停地叫嚣加强美国和西方的“军事实力”以对付苏联，要求发展“超现代化武器”。甚至还公开扬言“准备作战”。正像英国“每日先驱报”所形容的：“一阵战争言论的狂潮攫住了美国。”
    这就更加清楚地暴露了，破坏四国首脑会议，原是美国加紧备战计划中一个步骤，人们记得在四国首脑会议召开的前夕，艾森豪威尔在写给北大西洋集团伊斯坦布尔会议外长们的一封信中曾经说过：如果四国首脑会议谈判不成功，“我们将有更多的理由”来“保持我们的实力”。美国统治集团显然认为它已经制造了加紧扩军备战的“理由”了。
    在首脑会议刚失败不久，美国通讯社就透露艾森豪威尔政府将“加紧其全线的防御”，“加速努力以抵消苏联在发展火箭和空间武器方面的优势”。艾森豪威尔也急不及待地宣布：为了对付首脑会议后的局势，“我们必须保持我们的实力，并且长期保持下去”。而当时美国的军事领袖们更拚命叫嚷首脑会议的垮台“以最强有力的方式指出了”加强美国和“包括整个世界”的“国防”的“极端重要性”。他们叫嚣美国必须发展“新的、更高级的”武器。被捧为美国“氢弹之父”的帝国主义科学家泰勒更鼓吹美国必须不惜花费“成几十亿的美元”来发展空间武器和核武器，以便拥有“毁灭”苏联的力量。为了加速发展这样一支军事侵略力量，美国最近以来特别加紧进行“阿特拉斯”、“北极星”和“鲍马克”式导弹的试验。6月20日美国战略空军司令部又首次试射了在开动的火车上发射的“民兵”导弹。美国国防部已经下令加速修建“阿特拉斯”导弹发射场。仅在6月30日到7月8日九天中，美国就发射了八次导弹，几乎平均每天一次。美国国防部在7月17日悍然宣布，美国在今后两年内将进行十一次地下核爆炸试验。在此同时，美国国内卷起了增加军费的热潮。美国政府一再催促国会增加军事拨款。在众议院和参议院辩论增加军费时，美国垄断资本巨头纽约州长洛克菲勒和民主党总统候选人肯尼迪也一再要求大大增加军事开支。美国军火垄断资本更把首脑会议的失败称作“经济上的兴奋剂”积极鼓吹新的军事定货。在这种扩军的狂热下，美国国会两院于6月30日通过的1961财政年度军事拨款法案拨款近四百亿美元，比艾森豪威尔原来要求的还要多六亿六千万美元。这些增加的军费将特别用来发展间谍卫星和核动力潜力、发射“北极星”导弹潜艇以及增加陆军现代化武器。美国众议院7月1日又通过了一项法案，拨款近十亿美元用以在世界各地扩充军事基地。
    美国在破坏首脑会议之后，又在“紧密团结”的幌子下加强它的军事侵略集团，进一步挟持和驱使它的“盟国”同美国一起加紧扩军备战。不久以前，美国国务卿赫脱一再叫嚣：“今天的国际气候强调说明了保持团结和加强我们的联盟的力量的必要性。”艾森豪威尔也鼓吹必须“确保它的盟国站在我们这一边”。美国在首脑会议破裂的第二天立即在巴黎召开了北大西洋集团理事会特别会议。美国国务院发言人怀特说，北大西洋集团的十年扩军计划即将付诸执行。5月底美国又在华盛顿召开了东南亚条约组织八国外长会议，要求“盟国”配合美国在远东地区进行侵略活动，会后东南亚集团还派人同中央条约组织和北大西洋集团“加强联系”。在此同时，英国国防大臣沃金森前往华盛顿同美国国防部长盖茨举行了会谈，声言两国已决定联合“试制”美国的“闪电式”中程导弹，用以装备两国的轰炸机。他们还讨论了美国用“北极星”式导弹装备北大西洋集团部队的问题。不久，西德国防部长施特劳斯也相继赶到美国，商讨向美国购买核导弹加速西德原子武装的办法。西方通讯社透露，美国甚至正在策划取消巴黎条约对西德制造现代武器的一些限制。美国陆军部长布鲁克本月内相继到西德进行活动，策划用美国中程弹道导弹武装西德军队，并阴谋帮助西德建造一千吨的核潜艇和能发射核导弹的五千吨的驱逐舰。与此同时，西德国防部宣布，西德已经在波恩附近建成了第一个“奈克”式导弹连。6月初，美国和它的北大西洋集团八个“盟国”决定成立准备进行潜艇战的“研究中心”。最近，美国国防部发言人又透露，美国计划在西欧设置三百枚“北极星”中程导弹。加拿大“太平洋论坛报”6月30日还揭露美国正在加拿大北部建立针对中苏的核导弹基地。
    最近一个多月来随着亚洲人民反美风暴的兴起，美国也特别在亚洲地区加紧制造紧张局势和军事挑衅活动。美国破坏首脑会议之后，立即指使岸信介集团用武力强使国会非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约。不久前美国和岸信介集团又不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，悍然交换条约“批准书”。这完全暴露了美帝国主义加速日本重新武装、准备侵略战争的阴谋。5月31日至6月2日在华盛顿举行的东南亚集团部长理事会会议，是美帝国主义对远东和平的另一挑衅。美国在会上策划了在老挝、南越、南朝鲜、日本和台湾海峡的新的侵略计划，决定进一步扩大设在曼谷的军事计划机构。而会议最后公报更别有用心地说什么要“特别注意”“共产党在条约地区几个国家内的颠复、叛乱和恐怖活动的加紧”，妄图干涉这个地区的民族民主运动。为了配合这次东南亚集团会议的召开，美国空军一百二十架飞机在东南亚进行大规模的演习。在此同时，美国也不断加强在远东的备战部署。美国陆军部长布鲁克和陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔在国会作证时就曾透露，美国军方早就拟订好了“在东南亚进行战争的总计划”。美国空军部长夏普公然威胁说，美国和它的“盟国”在远东的空军已经“准备就绪”，而且“一直处于戒备状态”。6月初美国一支有现代装备的“特种战斗队”派往冲绳，准备在西太平洋地区进行“小型战争”。为了进一步压制亚洲各国人民的反美爱国正义斗争，并稳定美国在整个亚洲的侵略阵线，美国总统艾森豪威尔更硬着头皮跑到远东进行活动。配合这次强盗旅行，美国第七舰队和侵朝美军又在南朝鲜和台湾海峡进行挑衅性军事演习。由于亚洲人民，特别是日本人民的反抗和英勇斗争，使这位瘟神的远东之行遭到了极大的失败。但是美国帝国主义并没有甘心失败，目前它又在力图挣扎，加紧在远东进行新的侵略部署。美国海军决定增派有导弹的军舰到西太平洋活动。美国已经开始用“响尾蛇”式导弹装备菲律宾空军，并策划加紧用现代武器装备泰国军队。从7月1日起，侵朝美军同南朝鲜伪军进行了十五天的陆海空军“假想战争”演习。7月9日，侵朝美军悍然进行了“诚实的约翰”火箭和原子弹拟模的射击演习。同时，美国正在增加它在南朝鲜的军事力量，据7月12日出版的美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国正在把八千名美军运到南朝鲜。同一天，“联合国军”发言人公开承认了这一事实。另外据“纽约时报”报道，美国增派的侵略军有三千名已经到达南朝鲜。
    美国统治集团在竭力加强扩军和军事活动的同时，也毫不掩饰他们这样做的目的是为了准备新的侵略战争。5月19日美国战略空军司令鲍威尔在一篇演说中说：“我们既有决心而且准备作战。”5月24日美国海军作战参谋长伯克在一次讲话中说：“武器和军队必须应付任何局势；全面的热核战、有限战争或在某些多事地区比一比力量的必要性。”6月10日美国副总统尼克松公开叫嚷：美国和苏联的“冲突”“可能用战争来解决”。6月25日侵朝美军司令马格鲁德说：“世界上还会发生像朝鲜战争式的那种有限战争。”6月18日美国国防部长盖茨在讲话中叫嚣：美国现在有着“一个良好的军事计划”，“我们的作战准备毫无问题。”在26日他又叫嚷：“我们在军事上是有准备的和健全的，可以应付小规模战争，也可以应付大规模战争。”7月14日，美国陆军部长布鲁克叫嚷，美国驻在欧洲的侵略军都“处于经常战斗准备状态。”美国空军参谋长怀特最近也毫不讳言地叫喊，美国打算发动侵苏战争。
    为了加紧备战，美国统治集团疯狂地加剧冷战、制造紧张局势，并一再向社会主义国家挑衅。在美国U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联以后刚刚才两个月，美国RB—47型侦察机又侵犯苏联领空，进行无耻的挑衅。7月19日，艾森豪威尔同赫脱以及其他高级官员举行了“冷战”战略会议，策划进一步加剧紧张局势的行动。美国在本周并举行向社会主义国家挑衅的所谓“被奴役国家周”，疯狂地鼓吹颠复社会主义国家。
    美国及其帮凶的宣传机器把美国政府这一切加紧扩军备战的叫嚣和活动，诡称为什么“重新估计苏联挑起的冷战中的政策”的结果。这完全是无耻的鬼话。事实上，美国政府的扩军备战和“冷战”活动从来就没有一时一刻停止过。在四国首脑会议之前，美国政府就以“加强威慑力量”为名加紧发展导弹，建立导弹基地。美国也一直在加强它的军事集团的备战活动，并且重新武装西德和日本，复活这两个战争策源地的军国主义势力。美国也始终没有放弃向社会主义国家进行侵略挑衅。同时美国仍然霸占我国台湾，并在远东加紧制造紧张局势。艾森豪威尔在5月25日发表的广播演说就明确地说：“我们自己的政策也没有改变。”“当我们为这个会议（指四国首脑会议）进行准备的时候，我们并没有放松戒备”。而美国国务卿赫脱说得更露骨。他不久前公开宣称：杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策，“一直在继续指导我们”，“为我们服务”。这最清楚不过地说明：美国一直在进行扩军备战活动。如果说最近同过去有什么不同的话，那仅仅是以前美国披上了“和平”的伪装，而现在则在“对付苏联威胁”的幌子下做得更加明目张胆罢了。
    大家知道，在过去一个时期，美国是在玩弄“假和平、真备战”的把戏。为了争取时间挽救军事上的颓势，美国统治集团一面竭力散布假和平的烟幕来麻痹各国人民，实际上则在这种烟幕掩盖下积极进行扩军备战。正如我们早经指出的，美国这种两面手法是玩不长的，因为它本身存在着无法克服的矛盾。美国既然要加紧备战，它就无法不拆穿自己假和平的把戏。譬如，美国一边装着愿意通过谈判解决国际争端，而在四国首脑会议前夕也不能停止向苏联进行间谍飞行的挑衅活动。终于美国虚假的和平把戏完全露出马脚了，艾森豪威尔的“和平”外衣被扯得粉碎了。于是美国就重新敲响那加剧紧张局势的锣鼓，在紧张局势掩盖下进行扩军备战活动。从美国统治集团看来，这样做更能为所欲为。当然，就是在这样的情况下，美国的头面人物也并没放弃他们那种“和平”姿态的做作，但是他们的基调显然已经改变了。美国统治集团现在竭力以无中生有的所谓“苏联恢复了冷战政策”作为变本加厉地进行备战的借口。美国的这种做法，只能使各国人民更加清楚地认清美帝国主义的好战面目，促使一切爱好和平的人们更加提高警惕。
