The east wind reddens Hundred Flower Mountain, bearing golden fruits of perpetual fragrance,
Commune members’ faces beam with joy, everyone praising the strength of the commune.
Party Secretary Ren Chenglong, a hero in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war, today a veteran of the ranch, growing stronger with each passing day, his heart ever redder.
Communism is paradise; without culture, one cannot ascend. Men and women attend night school; the mountainous area will no longer have illiteracy.
The whip cracks resonantly, the sheep climb the mountain at dawn.
Green fields dotted with white, leaping songs echoing in the air.
The spring water gurgles at the foot of the mountain, the pasture grass by the water is green and fragrant.
Commune members love their cows and scrub them diligently, doubling milk production.

　　百花山上建乐园
　　中央美术学院国画系
    三、四年级同学集体创作
　　东风吹红百花山，结出金果万年香，
　　社员喜气上眉梢，人人争夸公社强。
　　党委书记任成龙游击抗日是英雄今天牧场当场长老当益壮心越红
　　共产主义是天堂没有文化不能上男男女女上夜校山区不再有文盲
　　鞭儿挥动响四方，清晨羊群上山岗，
　　满坡绿野点点白，跃进歌儿空中荡。
　　山下泉水哗哗响，水边牧草青又香。
　　社员爱牛勤刷洗，牛乳产量加倍长。
