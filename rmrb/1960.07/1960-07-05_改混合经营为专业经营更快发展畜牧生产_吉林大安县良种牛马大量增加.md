Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 4th: Da'an County, Jilin Province, has established three farms, three courtyards, and two networks at every level from the county to the commune and management district, promoting the comprehensive and high-speed development of animal husbandry. Currently, the county has more than 200 breeding farms, dam breeding farms, and foal rearing farms; 402 dam maternity yards, old and weak livestock recuperation yards, and sick livestock sanatoriums. In addition, there are 235 insemination stations and points, and 76 veterinary stations and clinics, forming a livestock insemination network and an animal disease prevention and control network.

The large-scale establishment of three farms, three courtyards, and two networks has changed animal husbandry from mixed operations to specialized operations, forming a complete scientific management system for dam pregnancy protection, livestock delivery, foal rearing, operation and feeding, and animal disease prevention and control, ensuring the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. The county's large livestock increased by a net 16.9% last year, and this year both large and small livestock have had bumper harvests. According to statistics at the end of May, the county's large livestock, after selling 657 heads, increased by a net 5.8% compared to the end of 1959. Not only has the quantity developed rapidly, but the quality has also greatly improved. Improved breeds of horses and cattle such as "Don," "Ardennes," and "Dutch" have spread throughout the county's pastures and villages. There are also more than 10,000 pregnant dams in the county that are gradually giving birth, and all barren dams have completed their first insemination. Inspection shows that the pregnancy rate is over 60%, and the rest are being checked and inseminated again. The rapid development of animal husbandry production has continuously increased the number of draught animals and manure needed for agricultural production.

The "three farms," "three courtyards," and "two networks" of animal husbandry in Da'an County were gradually formed on the road of agricultural collectivization and people's communes throughout the county. Before 1958, with the progress of agricultural collectivization, the livestock insemination network and animal disease prevention and control network on a county-wide scale initially took shape, playing a great role in increasing the dam pregnancy rate, accelerating breed improvement, and controlling various epidemics. With the realization of the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes, and the gradual increase in the number of livestock, since 1959, the "three farms" of animal husbandry have been established, managing livestock in groups and farms according to type, breed, age, and sex, which not only continuously improves the level of feeding management, but also greatly accelerates the progress of breeding improvement. In order to promote the high-speed development of animal husbandry and effectively prevent the death of young, old, weak, and sick livestock, the "three courtyards" of animal husbandry were also universally established this spring. The county has established a professional team of more than 7,000 people in livestock insemination, pregnancy protection, delivery, grazing, feeding, disease prevention and control, and forage crop cultivation. The pregnancy rate of dams in all dam breeding farms in the county has increased by more than 10% compared to before the establishment of the farms. In the past two years, the county has cultivated 2,105 excellent breeds of improved horses and improved cattle through foal rearing farms, and they have already been used for breeding. Concentrating livestock for operation facilitates capital construction. Livestock sheds have been universally built in various pastures, and more than a dozen larger livestock farms have established weather stations, so that livestock are no longer attacked by wind and rain, thereby reducing unnecessary losses. In order to meet the needs of animal husbandry development, various pastures have planted more than 300,000 mu of feed crops, laying a material foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. In addition, most livestock farms have achieved semi-mechanization in water supply and feed processing. After the universal establishment of the "three courtyards" this spring, old, weak, and sick livestock were sent to recuperation yards and sanatoriums for feeding and treatment, so that the county's livestock mortality rate decreased by more than half compared to the same period last year. Artificial delivery has been universally implemented in various dam maternity yards, and measures such as tying the umbilical cord and disinfecting the mouth have been taken, which greatly reduces the incidence of disease in young livestock. Therefore, the survival rate of young livestock this year has greatly increased compared to the same period last year.

After the establishment of the livestock insemination network and animal disease prevention and control network, not only can the role of breeding sires be brought into play, but also advanced insemination methods can be adopted to increase the dam pregnancy rate; it can also effectively prevent the occurrence of various epidemics. In the past two years, the county has improved more than 11,810 horses and cattle, and most of the pregnant dams this year are improved breeds. Various veterinary stations have also set up simple pharmaceutical factories. Through treatment and immunization injections, the county has basically controlled nine major epidemics such as anthrax, bovine pleuropneumonia, equine glanders, sheep scabies, and brucellosis.

Currently, the Da'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is leading the people of the county in carrying out a "double-full" (full pregnancy, full fattening) and "five-full" (full insemination, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, full strength) livestock-loving and livestock-increasing competition among communes, districts, and farms.

    改混合经营为专业经营更快发展畜牧生产
    吉林大安县良种牛马大量增加
    新华社长春4日电　吉林省大安县从县到公社、管理区层层建立三场、三院和两网，促进畜牧业全面高速度发展。现在，全县共有种畜繁育场、母畜繁殖场、幼驹培育场二百多处，母畜产院、老弱畜复壮院、病畜疗养院四零二处；此外，还有配种站、点二百三十五处，兽医站、所七十六处，形成了牲畜配种网和畜疫防治网。
    大办三场、三院、两网，把畜牧业的混合经营改变为专业经营，在母畜怀驹保胎、接产仔畜、幼驹培育、经营饲养、畜疫防治等方面形成一套完整的科学管理体系，保证了畜牧生产的高速度发展。全县大家畜去年净增16.9％，今年大畜小畜又样样丰收。据5月末的统计，全县大家畜除出卖六百五十七头，比1959年底净增5.8％。不但数量迅速发展，质量也有很大提高，“顿河”“阿尔登”“荷兰”等的改良马和改良牛遍及全县各个牧场和村庄。全县还有一万多头怀胎母畜正陆续产仔，空怀母畜已全部结束第一次配种，经检查怀胎率达60％多，其余正在查空补配。由于畜牧业生产的迅速发展，使农业生产需要的耕畜和粪肥不断增加。
    大安县的畜牧“三场”、“三院”、“两网”是在全县农业合作化、人民公社化的道路上逐步形成的。1958年以前，随着农业合作化的进展，全县范围内的牲畜配种网、畜疫防治网初具规模，对提高母畜怀胎率，加快品种改良和控制各种疫病都起了很大作用。随着大跃进、人民公社化的实现和牲畜数量的逐渐增加，从1959年以来办起了畜牧“三场”，将牲畜按种类品种、口齿、性别等分群、分场管理，不但能够不断提高饲养管理水平，也大大加快了繁殖改良进度。为使畜牧业高速度发展，有效制止仔畜和老畜、弱畜、病畜的死亡，在今春又普遍建成了畜牧“三院”。全县在牲畜的配种、保胎、接产、放牧、饲养、防治疫病和饲料种植等方面建成了七千多人的专业队伍。全县各母畜繁殖场的母畜怀胎率都比建场前提高10％以上。两年来，全县通过幼驹培育场已育成二千一百零五头优良品种的改良马和改良牛，并且已经用来配种。把牲畜集中起来经营，便于进行基本建设，各牧场普遍修起畜棚，并有十余处较大的畜牧场建立起气象哨，这样就使牲畜不再遭受风雨的袭击，从而减少了不应有的损失。为了适应畜牧业发展需要，各牧场种植三十多万亩饲料，为高速度发展畜牧业生产奠定了物资基础。此外，大部分畜牧场又在饮水、饲料加工等方面实现了半机械化。今春普遍建成“三院”后，将老弱畜和病畜分别送进复壮院和疗养院饲养和治疗，使全县牲畜死亡率比去年同期下降一半多。各母畜产院普遍实行了人工接产，采取扎脐带、断口消毒等办法，大大减少了仔畜发病率，因而今年仔畜成活率比去年同期有很大提高。
    建起牲畜配种网和畜疫防治网后，既能发挥种公畜的作用，又能采取先进配种方法提高母畜怀胎率；还能有效的制止各种疫病发生。两年来全县共改良马、牛一万一千八百一十多头，今年怀胎的母畜绝大部分是改良种。各兽医站还办了简易制药厂，通过治疗和防疫注射，全县基本控制了炭疽、牛肺疫、马鼻疽、羊疥癣、波状热等九大疫病。
    现在，中共大安县委正领导全县人民开展社与社、区与区、场与场的“双满”（满怀、满膘）、“五全”（全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮）的爱畜增畜竞赛运动。
