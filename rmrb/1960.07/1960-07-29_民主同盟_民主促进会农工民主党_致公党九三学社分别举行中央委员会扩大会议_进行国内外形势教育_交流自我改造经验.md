Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The China Democratic League, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, China Zhi Gong Party, and Jiusan Society and other democratic parties, simultaneously began holding Central Committee Enlarged Meetings in Beijing on the 25th.

The democratic parties separately put forward the tasks of the meeting, requesting that the meeting conduct education on the international and domestic situation, exchange experiences in serving socialism and self-remolding, in order to promote and help members of each party and the people they are connected with to further understand the situation, clarify the future, improve consciousness, actively participate in socialist construction, and strengthen the self-remolding of their worldviews.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the Democratic League, delivered the opening speech at the Second Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Third Central Committee of the Democratic League. He first pointed out: This meeting is being held under excellent domestic and international circumstances. He said: "As the Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era, we must correctly understand the objective laws of current historical development, have a full understanding of the domestic and international situation, so that we can firmly stand our ground, resolutely oppose imperialism, oppose modern revisionism that serves imperialism, and actively devote ourselves to the technical revolution, cultural revolution and education revolution, and contribute our strength to the noble cause of socialism and communism." He said: "To keep up with the situation, we must transform our subjective world, that is, we must further transform our position and worldview." Shen Junru called on members of the Democratic League to achieve the following through this meeting: recognize the situation, boost morale, affirm achievements, analyze problems, actively serve, strengthen transformation, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and be consciously revolutionary. At the opening of the meeting, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Democratic League, delivered a work report of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic League.

The opening ceremony of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Fifth Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy was presided over by Vice Chairman Zhou Jianren, and Vice Chairman Wang Shao'ao delivered the opening speech. He said: This meeting of the China Association for Promoting Democracy is a meeting for situation education, a meeting for general line education, and also a meeting for self-education. We must, through this meeting, recognize the situation, recognize ourselves, clarify the direction of our efforts, raise our awareness, strengthen transformation, muster our energy, strive for advancement, and together with the people of the whole country, contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of our country, to the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and to the cause of progress of all mankind. Wang Shao'ao said: "At present, the technical revolution and cultural revolution, the teaching reform and the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, are all unfolding in depth, which means that our bourgeois intellectuals are both fully exposed to our ideological consciousness and fully exposed to our professional knowledge. We must actively and proactively devote ourselves to this struggle, transform ourselves and improve ourselves in the struggle."

The Second Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party was presided over by Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee, and Zhou Gucheng, a member of the Presidium, delivered the opening speech. When talking about the international and domestic situation, Zhou Gucheng said: The new and greater situation has put forward more urgent requirements to us, requiring us to better serve socialism; therefore, we must more actively strengthen self-education and self-transformation. He said: Although we have made great progress, there are still various problems in the progress, so we must continue to strengthen self-education and self-transformation, and move towards the great goal of the intellectualization of the working class.

At the Fourth (Enlarged) Meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, Chairman Chen Qiyou delivered the opening speech. He talked about how the China Zhi Gong Party should use this meeting to examine what achievements its members have made since the Great Leap Forward in serving socialist construction and in the fundamental self-transformation of their positions and thoughts, what problems still exist, and discuss how the China Zhi Gong Party can better play its role in the current favorable domestic and international situation, how to mobilize the enthusiasm of all its members, and promote their active participation in the technical revolution, cultural revolution, education revolution, receiving returned overseas Chinese, and supporting agricultural work. He hoped that members of the China Zhi Gong Party would achieve greater results in their future service and transformation.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, delivered the opening speech at the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Fifth Central Committee of the Jiusan Society. He pointed out that this meeting is a meeting of great political significance for the Jiusan Society. After analyzing the domestic and international situation, he said: Under the situation of the deep development of the socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front, many people feel that they cannot keep up with the situation and urgently demand to strengthen self-transformation, which is very natural. Therefore, this meeting was held in a timely manner to help members of the Jiusan Society and the intellectuals they are connected with further understand the situation, clarify the direction, devote themselves to mass movements, be consciously revolutionary, and better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction.

The responsible persons of the various democratic parties emphasized at the opening ceremony of the meeting that this meeting should adopt the policy of gentle breeze and drizzle, self-education, and self-transformation, and called on everyone to open up their minds, speak freely, think independently, and debate freely in the meeting, in order to achieve the goal of feeling comfortable and improving their thinking.

In addition to the central committee members of each party, the meeting was attended by responsible persons of local organizations and a number of representative members.

After the meetings of the various democratic parties were opened separately, they have been widely discussing in the past few days.
