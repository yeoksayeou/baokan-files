    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 19th - Hungary's state-owned industries exceeded the industrial production plan for the first half of this year by 4%. Compared with the same period last year, output increased by approximately 15%. Labor productivity increased by 8% compared to the same period last year.
    This was announced by the Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics in a communiqué regarding the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of the year. The communiqué stated that in the first half of this year, the production of heavy industry (excluding mining) and light industry increased by 18% and 9% respectively, compared to the first half of last year. The production of the machine industry and chemical industry within heavy industry has developed particularly rapidly.
    In the first half of this year, coal production reached 13.1 million tons, an increase of 5% compared to the same period last year; oil production reached 574,000 tons, an increase of 29% compared to the same period last year; electricity generation was 3.721 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year; steel production was 945,000 tons, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year.
    The communiqué stated that agricultural production cooperatives and state farms now account for 74.3% of the country's cultivated land. As of June 30 this year, there were 4,400 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, possessing 5.4 million holds of cultivated land. (Each hold equals 8.55 mu.)
    The level of agricultural mechanization has been significantly improved. The amount of work completed by machine tractor stations in the first half of this year almost doubled compared to the same period last year.
    Compared with the same period last year, the purchase volume of fattened pigs increased by 18% and the purchase volume of cattle increased by 11%.
    The communiqué pointed out that residents' income increased by 12% compared to the same period last year, and domestic trade retail sales also increased by 14% compared to the same period last year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 20th - The workers in Bulgaria's chemical and pulp industry sector exceeded the production plan for the first half of this year by 2.9%, increasing the total value of production by approximately 35% compared to the same period last year.
    Among them, the products directly related to the development of agricultural production have increased the most. For example, nitrogen fertilizer production increased by approximately 40,000 tons compared to the same period last year, phosphate fertilizer increased by approximately 50,000 tons, and medicines for preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests increased by approximately 60%.
    According to Kuztanov, Minister of the Chemical and Pulp Industry Department of the Bulgarian Industrial Committee, the basic reason for the rapid growth in chemical and pulp industry production in Bulgaria is that the broad masses of workers have brought into play their enthusiasm and initiative in their work, actively put forward rationalization proposals, mechanized or automated some production processes, and fully exploited and utilized the potential of existing equipment. He said that, according to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year alone, there were more than 320 rationalization proposals that had been adopted, increasing the country's wealth by approximately 4 million leva (Bulgarian currency).

    匈超额完成上半年工业生产计划
    保加利亚化学和纸浆工业生产增长迅速
    新华社布达佩斯19日电　匈牙利国营工业超额4％完成了今年上半年的生产计划，与去年同时期比较，产量增长了约15％。劳动生产率比去年同期增长了8％。
    这是匈牙利中央统计局在关于上半年国民经济计划执行情况的公报中宣布的。公报说，在今年上半年内，重工业（不包括矿业在内）和轻工业的生产分别较去年上半年增长了18％，食品工业约增长了9％。重工业中的机器工业和化学工业生产得到了特别迅速的发展。
    今年上半年煤产量达一千三百一十万吨，比去年同期增长5％；石油产量达五十七万四千吨，比去年同期增加29％；发电量为三十七亿二千一百万度，比去年同期增长11％；钢产量为九十四万五千吨，比去年同期增长10％。
    公报说，目前匈牙利农业合作社和国营农场的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的74.3％。到今年6月30日为止，全国共有四千四百个农业生产合作社，它们拥有耕地五百四十万霍尔特。（每霍尔特合八点五五市亩）
    农业机械化的程度有了显著的提高。今年上半年机器拖拉机站完成的工作量比去年同期几乎增长了一倍。
    与去年同时期相比，今年上半年肥猪的收购量增加了18％，牛的收购量增加了11％。
    公报指出，居民的收入比去年同期增加了12％，国内贸易零售额也比去年同期增长14％。
    新华社索非亚20日电　保加利亚化学和纸浆工业部门的职工，超额2.9％完成了今年上半年的生产计划，使生产总值比去年同期增长了约35％。
    其中，增长最多的是与发展农业生产直接有关的产品。例如，氮肥产量比去年同期增加了约四万吨，磷肥增加了约五万吨，防治农作物病虫害的药品增加了约60％。
    据保加利亚工业委员会化学和纸浆工业部部长库兹塔诺夫最近对本社记者说，保加利亚化学和纸浆工业生产迅速增长的基本原因是广大职工们发挥了工作的积极性和主动性，积极提出合理化建议，使一些生产过程机械化或自动化，充分发挥和利用了现有设备的潜力。他说，据不完全统计，今年上半年，仅已采用的合理化建议就有三百二十多条，为国家增加了约四百万列弗（保币名）的财富。
