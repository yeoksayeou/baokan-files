My father is in Indonesia,
The day I was born, we were separated,
—In lullabies, in songs,
Children in the overseas Chinese hometown hear stories of their fathers...
Working together with uncles in floral shirts,
Sweat mingling,
They irrigate the land of Java,
Or ring bells under the palm trees in the countryside,
Sending colorful fabrics to aunts in Sumatra.
Thus, the tropical fertile plantations grow rubber trees,
The white latex contains my father's sweat,
Under the lamplight, Indonesian women embroider fabrics,
Stitching the friendship of the nations firmly together...
My father loves the place where he labors,
And hasn't returned for a long time,
Even after the motherland was liberated.
Because of friendly life, because of kind friends,
He regards Indonesia as his second hometown...
But where is he now?
Is he wandering the streets?
Beaten by Surabaya soldiers, his goods confiscated?
Or is he waiting a long time outside the customs,
To press those several hundred unreasonable fingerprints?...
Why treat him like this?
This is not the will of the nation,
He is not a Dutch capitalist,
He was sold to Indonesia,
The colonizers threw him into the hold of a ship,
Treating him as a slave,
He earns a living by sweat,
Not seeking profit by cannons.
No! He will return,
Aboard the Da Bao Kang ship,
The powerful Chinese people will rescue their compatriots,
Those uncles and aunts will help him, comfort him,
And pack his pitifully small backpack for him...
When rubber flows like milk,
And mature coffee from the mountains is about to be sold,
Indonesian farmers will ask:
Why haven't the Chinese friends come yet?
Working together, suffering together,
Even shedding blood together,
What law can separate the friendship of the people like this?!

　　我的爸爸在印度尼西亚
　　韩灃我的爸爸在印尼，出生那天，我们便分离，——在催眠曲中，在歌谣里，侨乡的孩子听到他们爸爸的故事……和系花裙的叔叔们劳动在一起，汗水交溶，他们浇灌爪哇的土地，或者摇着铃铛在乡村的棕榈树下，给苏门答腊的婶婶送去彩线布匹。于是热带肥沃的种植园长起胶树，白色的乳液中含有我爸爸的汗珠，灯光下印度尼西亚妇女绣制织物一针一线把民族的友谊牢牢缝固……我的爸爸热爱他劳动的地方，迟迟没回来，当祖国已经解放。因为友好的生活，因为善良的朋友，他把印度尼西亚当作第二个故乡……但如今他在哪里？是否流落街头？被泗水军人打伤，货担也被没收？还是为了按那几百个无理的指印，在海关的门外长期等候？……为什么这样对他？这不是民族的意志，他不是荷兰资本家，他是被卖到印尼，殖民者把他摔进船舱，当作奴隶，他是用汗水谋生，不是借大炮求利。不！他会回来的，乘着大宝康号，强大的中国人民会拯救自己的难胞，那些叔叔婶婶们会帮助他、安慰他，替他捆好那小得可怜的背包……当橡胶流奶，山区成熟的咖啡要出卖，印度尼西亚农夫会问：中国朋友怎么还不来？共同劳动、共同受苦，甚至共同流血，什么法令能把人民这样的友谊分开？！
