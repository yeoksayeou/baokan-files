	Greece Increases Military Spending Again
	Athens Dispatch: The Greek government is stepping up its military expansion in accordance with the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	It is reported that the Greek government recently decided to increase military spending by 300 million drachmas (Greek currency).
	The Cypriot newspaper "Haravghi" published a commentary saying that this increase in military spending shows that the Greek government continues to pursue a "Cold War" policy. The newspaper pointed out that this increase is a new provocation against the starving workers and peasants. The newspaper said that Greece's military spending has been increasing continuously in the past seven years: from 3.5 billion drachmas in 1954 to 5.5 billion drachmas in 1960. However, today 2.98 million people in Greece live in poverty. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people reaches 2 million, accounting for 25% of the Greek population.
	Serious Juvenile Delinquency in the United States
	Washington Dispatch: A United Press International dispatch on the 4th said that "a considerable proportion" of American youth "use drugs, have criminal tendencies, and have their heads full of sex."
	This situation was revealed in a survey report published by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. This part of the survey report, which reflects the so-called "American way of life," said that in 1958, 2 million young people were arrested in the United States, of whom 500,000 had committed crimes that required court trials.
