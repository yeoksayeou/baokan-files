　　Conscientiously Do a Good Job of Engineering Queueing, Batch Raids, and Annihilation Battles

　　Engineering queueing in basic construction, organizing battles in phases and batches, and fighting annihilation battles are strategic deployments to specifically implement the Party's general line for socialist construction. It means rapidly completing all construction projects that can be completed through effort by queueing, and then continuing efforts to strive for greater achievements. Therefore, engineering queueing is not a passive approach, but an active measure. Because within a certain period, human and material resources are always limited, and technical strength, building materials, and equipment supply cannot meet the needs of all projects at the same time. Therefore, construction must have a priority, and we must concentrate existing human and material resources on those important projects to complete them and put them into production as early as possible, so as to give play to the investment effect. Only in this way can we provide more favorable conditions for the construction of the next batch of projects. Otherwise, regardless of importance and urgency, regardless of key and non-key, rushing headlong into mass action will inevitably disperse human and material resources, which will not only fail to guarantee the key projects, but also prolong the construction period of all projects, fail to quickly realize the investment effect, and be detrimental to the cause of basic construction. Therefore, strengthening engineering queueing, concentrating forces, and guaranteeing key projects will not only not hinder the construction of non-key but necessary projects, but will also create reliable conditions for them. Therefore, striving to complete more basic construction plans and carrying out strict engineering queueing are a unity of contradictions, a dialectical relationship.

　　The process of conducting engineering queueing is also a process of ideological struggle. In the process of queueing, there will not only be departmentalism obstructing—they disregard the importance and urgency, one-sidedly emphasize the importance of their own projects, and demand early start-up. Even the majority of construction units will easily emphasize the importance of their own projects because they do not understand the overall situation. Therefore, when queueing, the determination must be great and the attitude must be firm. Engineering queueing should not only be done by the leadership departments, but also organize discussions among various units. Through discussions, we can achieve the goals of raising awareness, unifying understanding, clarifying goals, highlighting key points, and implementing plans. We must make everyone convinced, mobilize everyone's positive factors, and promote the realization of the queueing plan.

　　Is there a contradiction between conducting engineering queueing, guaranteeing key projects, and launching a widespread "small-modern groups" and "small-indigenous groups" movement? There is no contradiction. Because the "small-modern groups" and "small-indigenous groups" mostly carry out construction by using local materials, relying on their own efforts, and starting easily, and do not occupy or only use a very small amount of the three major materials, and are not restricted by the three major materials. At the same time, due to the engineering queueing and batch raids, we can also free up communes and other construction forces, which is more conducive to the construction of "small-modern groups" and "small-indigenous groups."

### 切实做好工程排队分批突击打歼灭战

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　切实做好工程排队分批突击打歼灭战
    基本建设的工程排队，分期分批地组织战役、打歼灭战，是具体贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的战略部署问题，是通过排队把一切经过努力可以完成的建设项目，迅速完成，然后再继续努力，争取更大的成绩。所以，工程排队不是消极的作法，而是积极的措施。因为在一定时间内，人力、物力总是有一定限度的，技术力量、建筑材料和设备供应不可能在同一时间内满足一切工程的需要。所以施工一定要有先有后，一定要把已有的人力、物力集中地使用在那些重要的工程上去，使其及早建成投入生产，发挥投资效果。也只有这样，才能为下一批建设项目的施工提供更为有利的条件。否则，不分轻重缓急，不分重点和非重点，一拥而上，齐头并进，其结果势必分散人力、物力，不但不能保证重点，而且会使所有工程把工期拖长，不能迅速发挥投资效果，对基本建设事业不利。因此，加强工程排队，集中力量，保证重点不仅不会妨碍非重点的必要项目的建设，而且会给其创造可靠的条件。因此，争取更多地完成基本建设计划和进行严格的工程排队，是矛盾的统一，是辩证的关系。
    进行工程排队的过程，也是思想斗争的过程。在排队的过程中，不仅会有本位主义的阻拦——他们不顾轻重缓急，片面强调自己工程重要，要求提早上马，就是多数的建设单位，也会因为不了解全局，易于强调自己工程重要。因此，排队的时候决心要大，态度要坚定。工程排队，不仅领导部门排，而且要组织各单位进行辩论。通过辩论，达到提高思想，统一认识，明确目标，突出重点，落实计划的目的。要做到使大家心悦诚服，调动大家的积极因素，促进排队计划的实现。
    进行工程排队，保证重点和遍地开花，大搞“小洋群”、“小土群”运动是否有矛盾呢？是没有矛盾的。因为“小洋群”、“小土群”多以就地取材，自力更生，简易上马进行建设，并不占用或只用极少量三大材料，不受三大材料限制。同时，由于进行工程排队，分批突击，还可以腾出公社和其他施工力量，更有利于进行“小洋群”、
  “小土群”建设。
