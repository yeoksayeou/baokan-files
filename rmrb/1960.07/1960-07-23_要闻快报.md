All Sectors Support Iron Smelting
　　In Heilongjiang Province, a mass movement to support iron smelting is being widely carried out in all sectors. All sectors are vigorously supporting the effort according to their capabilities, from equipment and technical strength needed for the technical transformation of mines and blast furnaces, to providing leading cadres. As a result, the production of pig iron has been powerfully promoted.

Guangxi Actively Increases Fertilizer Production
　　Fertilizer plants in various parts of Guangxi adhere to the principle of "adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and relying on self-reliance" to actively produce fertilizers to support agriculture. The fertilizer produced in the first half of this year increased by more than five times the output of the entire last year. In previous years, only calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, potassium calcium mixed fertilizer, and glass fertilizer were produced. In the first half of this year, defluorinated phosphate fertilizer, calcium magnesium fertilizer, calcium magnesium potassium fertilizer, ordinary superphosphate, and ammonium sulfate were added. The quality has also improved significantly.

Cultivating Technical Strength for Rural Areas
　　In the mass movement to support agriculture, all sectors of Shenyang City actively help rural areas accelerate the cultivation of technical strength. Supporting rural units are using the method of "inviting up" (communes select some young people to work as apprentices in factories) to help rural communes train more than 1,200 technicians. In addition, the method of "sending down" (factories send people to rural communes to teach technology) has been used to train 500 technicians for rural communes in various places.

Harbin Electric Carbon Plant is One Factory Equivalent to Eight Factories
　　In the in-depth development of the "one equals several" movement, the "four modernizations" have been continuously upgraded, and production has been doubled and redoubled by the workers of the Harbin Electric Carbon Plant. By the end of June, the production level had increased by seven times compared with the original design level, realizing one factory being equivalent to eight factories. Entering July, it has also achieved daily successes and overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days of the month.

Cargo Ship Produces 45,000 Ton-Kilometers per Month
　　The Zhejiang Yun 102 ship of the Hangzhou District Shipping Bureau of Zhejiang Province created a high-yield achievement of 45,000 ton-kilometers per month in June, exceeding the inland waterway transportation competition initiative target proposed by the representatives of the National Hero Conference by two times. Now, this cargo ship has completed its annual transportation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Qingdao Paper Mill Comprehensively Leaps Forward
　　The Qingdao Paper Mill in Shandong Province mobilized the masses to carry out technological innovations and technological revolutions around the key issues affecting paper quality, such as insufficient raw material processing and insufficient drying capacity. This not only improved quality, but also increased output and greatly saved raw materials. As of the end of June, the entire factory had completed 57.31 percent of the annual plan, the finished product rate increased by 1.89 percent compared with the planned target, and more than 400 tons of pulp were saved.

Boldly Reform Standard Products
　　Workers of the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory in Guizhou Province boldly reformed already-standardized products such as rock drills, winches, crushers, and ball mills. These standardized products are mostly old products that have been produced for seven or eight years, with large parts and heavy weight, resulting in the use of more materials and long processing times. After the reform, not only the quality and efficiency have been improved, but also materials and man-hours have been greatly saved. The materials and man-hours for making one product can now be used to make two and a half products.

Let New Products Be Put into Production Quickly
　　The Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory broke the conventional practice of the so-called "three stages" that new products must go through sample trial production, small-batch trial production, and mass production. It adopted methods such as highly parallel large cross-operation to greatly shorten the production time of new products, so that twelve of the sixteen high-precision new products that have been successfully trial-produced have been put into mass production; twenty of the twenty-two old products that have been improved in design have been put into mass production.

    要闻快报
    各行各业支援炼铁
    黑龙江省各行各业正在广泛开展支援炼铁的群众运动。各行各业都根据自己所能，从矿山、高炉进行技术改造所需要的设备、技术力量和领导干部等方面，大力支援。结果，有力地促进了生铁生产。
    广西积极增产化肥
    广西各地化肥厂坚持“因地制宜，就地取材，自力更生”的原则，积极生产化肥，支援农业。今年上半年生产的化肥比去年全年的产量还增长了五倍多。往年只生产钙镁磷肥、钾钙混合肥和玻璃肥料几种化肥，今年上半年增加了脱氟磷肥、钙镁肥、钙镁钾肥、普通过磷酸钙和硫酸铵等。质量也有显著提高。
    为农村培养技术力量
    沈阳市各行各业在支援农业的群众运动中，积极帮助农村加速培养技术力量。各支援农村的单位用“请上来”（由公社选派部分青年到工厂做徒工）的办法，已帮助农村公社培训了一千二百多技术人员。另外，又用“派下去”（工厂抽人下到农村公社传授技术）的办法，为各地农村公社培训了五百名技术人员。
    哈尔滨电碳厂一厂顶八厂
    哈尔滨电碳厂职工在深入开展“一顶几”运动中，“四化”不断升级，生产不断翻番。到六月末止，生产水平比原设计水平猛增七倍，实现了一厂顶八厂。进入七月，又实现了日日红，并超额完成了上旬计划。
    货轮月产四万五千吨公里
    浙江杭州区航运局浙运一○二轮六月份创造了月产四万五千吨公里的高产成绩，超过了全国群英会代表们提出的内河航运竞赛倡议指标的两倍。现在，这艘货轮已经提前超额完成了全年的运输任务。
    青岛造纸厂全面跃进
    山东省青岛造纸厂发动群众，围绕着原料处理不细和烘干能力不足等影响纸张的关键问题，大搞技术革新和技术革命，不但提高了质量，而且提高了产量和大大节约了原料。截至六月底止，全厂已完成年计划的百分之五十七点三一，成品率比计划指标提高百分之一点八九，并节约了纸浆四百多吨。
    大胆改革定型产品
    贵州省贵阳矿山机器厂职工，大胆改革已经定型的锻钎机、卷扬机、破碎机和球磨机等产品。这些定型的产品大都是生产了七、八年的老产品，件大、体重，因而用材多，加工时间长。经过改革后，不仅提高了质量和效能，而且大大节约了材料和工时，原来做一台产品的材料、工时，现在可做两台半。
    让新产品迅速投入生产
    上海电焊机厂大破新产品上马必须经过样品试制、小批试制、成批生产的所谓“三阶段”的常规，采取高度平行大交叉作业等办法，大大缩短了新产品生产时间，使已经试制成功的十六种高精尖新产品，有十二种成批投入生产；改进设计后的二十二种老产品，有二十种成批投入生产。
