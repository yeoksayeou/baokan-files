Tremendous Achievements in Recycling Waste Products
    Commercial departments throughout the country, focusing on cities, are vigorously recovering, processing, adjusting, and supplying waste materials to open up sources of industrial raw materials. In the first half of the year, 4 million tons of waste materials were purchased, more than double the amount in the same period last year. In cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, waste materials adjusted among various departments were about twice the amount purchased. After sorting and processing, most of the various waste materials were used as industrial raw materials.

Ten Thousand People Go Up the Mountains to Seize Coal and Iron
    Responding to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, employees of industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade systems in Chengdu are launching a campaign of ten thousand people going up the mountains to carry out crash production and transportation of coal and iron. In order to send more people up the mountains, the Third Construction Company of the province also launched a wave of promoting advanced machinery, striving to enable 50% to 70% of workers to achieve a work efficiency of "one equaling three" within this month.

Camping at the Furnace to Grasp Quality
    Party and government leading cadres of Tangshan Iron Plant camped at the furnace to vigorously grasp the quality of pig iron. Liu Yuchun, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, worked as a feeding worker and slag cleaning worker at No. 6 furnace of the First Ironmaking Workshop, screening raw materials batch by batch and cleaning slag furnace by furnace. He also established management systems such as democratic ironmaking and a "three-shift joint review" of furnace conditions, ensuring the continuous improvement of pig iron quality. Since mid-July, the qualification rate of pig iron at this plant has increased by more than 22% compared with the first ten days of the month.

Massive Indicator Competition
    Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant launched an indicator competition throughout the plant. They established indicator exchange relationships with twenty-three factories. They compared the indicators of fraternal factories with those of their own factory, identified weak links, and formulated plans for learning, comparing, catching up, and surpassing. After a period of catching up, 117 of the 149 individual indicators that lagged behind fraternal factories have been caught up with and surpassed.

New Design for Saving Materials
    Employees of seven design institutes in Shenyang jointly proposed to design institutes in Beijing and Shanghai a proposal for "vigorously carrying out a revolution in design content." In the past six months, various units have made many new designs. The characteristics of these new designs are: adapting to local conditions, using local materials, quick start-up, low investment, and meeting the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. The new type of building designed by the Liaoning Provincial Design Institute based on the principle of fully utilizing waste materials has basically achieved the goal of building without steel bars, wood, red bricks, or boilers.

Crash Transport of Ore and Coal
    Weiyuan Tasha Iron Plant in Sichuan Province has vigorously grasped internal and external transportation, so that ore and coking coal from the production area to the blast furnace, through rails, cableways, cars, winches, and chutes, form a "one-dragon" continuous transportation line, realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized transportation. The average daily transportation volume per person has increased by nearly two times compared with the beginning of the year, and the transportation cost has decreased by 43% compared with the same period last year.

Participating in Local Railway Construction
    The Local Railway Group, composed of more than 600 teachers and students from Beijing Railway Institute, has successively gone to eight provinces and cities, including Beijing, Anhui, Hebei, and Henan, since November last year. While participating in the construction of modern railways, they enthusiastically participated in the construction of local railways. In a few months, they designed 35 local railways with a total length of 480 kilometers, more than 300 bridges and culverts, and designed 10 types of local railway diesel locomotives and more than 20 types of vehicles, creatively solving many key problems. They also collected a complete set of materials and wrote more than 1,000 scientific research papers, and are currently compiling a textbook on "Local Railway Science."

    要闻快报
    回收废品成绩巨大
    全国各地商业部门，为了开辟工业原料来源，以城市为重点，大力回收、加工、调剂、供应废旧物资。上半年收购废旧物资达四百万吨，比去年同期增长一倍多。北京、天津、广州、沈阳等市，组织各部门互相调剂的废品废料，约为收购量的两倍。各种废品废料经过整理加工，大部分作了工业原料。
    万人上山夺煤铁
    成都市工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸等系统的职工响应市委号召，开展万人上山，突击生产，运输煤铁。省建筑三公司为了多抽人上山，还掀起了推广先进机具的热潮，力争本月内使50％到70％的工人，工效达到“一顶三”。
    炉前扎营抓质量
    唐山铁厂党、政领导干部到炉前扎营，大抓生铁质量。党委副书记刘玉春到第一炼铁车间六号炉当供料工、清渣工，原料批批过筛，渣子炉炉清理，并建立了民主炼铁、三班“会审”炉况等管理制度，保证了生铁质量的不断提高。7月中旬以来，这个厂生铁合格率比上旬提高22％以上。
    群众性的指标赛
    大连机车车辆厂，在全厂开展了比指标竞赛。他们和二十三个工厂建立了指标交换关系。他们把兄弟厂的指标和本厂的作对比，找出薄弱环节，制订学、比、赶、超规划。经过一番追赶，在落后于兄弟厂的一百四十九项单项指标中，已有一百一十七项赶上和超过了兄弟工厂。
    节约材料的新设计
    沈阳市七个设计院职工，联合向北京、上海各设计院提出了“大搞设计内容革命”的倡议。半年多来，各单位做出许多新设计，这些新设计的特点是：因地制宜，就地取材，上马快，投资少，符合多快好省的要求。辽宁省设计院以充分利用废料的原则设计的新型大楼，基本实现了盖楼不用钢筋、木材、红砖和锅炉。
    突击运输矿石煤炭
    四川省威远沓水铁厂，大抓厂内外运输，使矿石、焦煤从产区到高炉、通过轨道、索道、车子、绞车、梭槽组成了“一条龙”连续运输线，实现了机械化半机械化运输，每人平均日运量比年初提高近两倍，运输成本比去年同期下降43％。
    参加土铁路建设
    北京铁道学院六百多名师生组成的地方铁路组，从去年11月以来，先后分赴北京、安徽、河北、河南等八个省市，在参加现代化铁路建设的同时，热情参加土铁路的建设。几个月内，他们共设计了三十五条共长四百八十公里的土铁路，三百多座桥梁涵洞，设计了十种土铁路的内燃机车和二十多种车辆，创造性地解决了许多关键问题。他们还收集一整套资料，写出科学研究论文一千多篇，目前正在编写“土铁路学”的教科书。
