　　Youthful Cuba
　　Li Shaochun
    I came to Latin America, far away from my motherland, with the Chinese Art Troupe. Here, I will talk about some of my observations in heroic Cuba.

    Cuba, this island nation standing tall in the Caribbean Sea, has an area of 114,500 square kilometers and a population of over six million. Yet, it bravely stands on the front lines of Latin America's struggle against U.S. imperialism. Youthful Cuba, unmoved by threats and inducements, is immersed in the country's economic and national defense construction, gradually eliminating various imperialist privileges and influences in Cuba. Youthful Cuba is moving forward towards independence, self-reliance, and prosperity with nationwide unity. Even before arriving in Cuba, these heroic deeds filled me with great admiration for her.

      Since May 30th, when I arrived in Cuba with the Chinese Art Troupe for a twenty-day friendly visit and performance, I have come into contact with many Cuban friends and heard and seen some of the actual situations in Cuban society. I cannot help but feel that this is such a promising country! Cuba is in a beautiful era of youth, full of revolutionary vigor everywhere. Her leaders have ideals and drive, leading the people of the whole country to work hard in unity. Her people are simple, hardworking, strong, and honest, with both the bold, warm, and enthusiastic character of Latin American Blacks and excellent cultural traditions. Today, they have an even stronger sense of national self-esteem and a noble spirit of patriotism than in the past, holding an infinitely optimistic attitude towards Cuba's future.

    Havana, the capital of Cuba, is a beautiful city. Now, the slogan "Homeland or Death" flies on all government buildings, and newspapers and radio stations constantly promote the same theme. It constantly reminds the people to prepare to arm themselves and be vigilant against the imperialists' conspiracy of armed intervention. The Cuban people have not forgotten that since the establishment of the revolutionary government more than a year ago, U.S. military aircraft have violated Cuban airspace more than forty times (according to figures released by Prime Minister Castro); on several occasions, they have even committed the crimes of throwing bombs and strafing with machine guns. When we visited the Ciudad Libertad Airport in Havana, we saw the wreckage of a U.S. reconnaissance plane that had been shot down ten days earlier. In the tenth-floor restaurant of the Hotel Santa Clara, where we once stayed, the ceiling was riddled with traces of machine-gun fire from U.S. aircraft.

    The leaders of the Cuban government, the revolutionary soldiers, still maintain the dress of their guerrilla days, with officers and soldiers alike. Many have also retained their long hair and beards. Women officials mostly do not wear makeup and dress simply and generously, working with a serious attitude. I have found that they are all very young. The tall and sturdy Prime Minister Castro is only thirty-two years old this year, the ministers are even younger, and so are the middle and lower-level officials. During our visit and performance in the interior, from Santiago in Oriente Province, the Las Mercedes military camp in the Sierra Maestra base area, to Camagüey and Santa Clara, the party, government, and military leaders we saw were all very young. Miss Monal, the director of the National Theatre of Havana, and her subordinates are all around twenty years old. One of the stage managers, Leo Lopez, claimed to be seventeen years old, but others said he was only fifteen; he is tall and lanky, with an immature air, but in the revolutionary struggle against Batista, he had already taken on some leadership work in his hometown of Santa Clara. We saw him working very hard, and advised him to take time to rest. He replied, "Now is not the time to sleep, we need to work, we must catch up!" Their revolutionary drive is very touching; and almost all military and government personnel here, especially senior officials, are very busy and sleep very little.

    On the first night in Havana, around two o'clock in the morning, when we were almost all asleep, the Minister of the Armed Forces of Cuba, Raúl Castro, came to visit us at the hotel because he had no time during the day. He met with the head of the delegation, Chen Zhongjing, and had a cordial conversation with him for a long time. Raúl Castro is an outstanding military strategist and is also cultivated and fond of the arts. He was very warm and friendly to all members of the Chinese Art Troupe. He took time out of his busy schedule to accompany us on a visit to a cooperative in the suburbs of Havana and had a very cordial lunch with us. Raúl Castro talked to me about the development of Cuban culture and art, which had been interrupted by the long-term aggression of imperialism. Since the victory of the revolution, the government has begun to unearth national and folk traditional arts and establish Cuba's own national culture and art. He sincerely told me that commercialization is still a serious problem in Cuban culture and art, and that efforts will be made to eliminate this undesirable factor in the future. He believed that the arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe would be of great help and influence to the development of Cuban culture and art. I expressed to him the Chinese artists' deep concern for the development of Cuban national culture and art, and their desire to learn from the excellent Cuban national culture and art. We believe that Cuban national culture and art will have great development under the leadership of the revolutionary government.

    The palm trees in Cuba grow tall and straight, standing heroically, unafraid of wind and rain; under the clear blue sky and white clouds, they symbolize the heroic posture of Cuba, a young country that has stood up. During the journey, I could not help but take a few more glances at them; seeing them, I am reminded of the countless young heroes of this country, who are doing great things for their motherland and for the people!

　　青春的古巴
　　李少春
    我随中国艺术团来到了远离祖国的拉丁美洲，这里谈谈我在英勇的古巴的一些见闻。
    古巴这个屹立在加勒比海上的岛国，面积十一万四千五百平方公里，人口六百多万，然而它英勇地挺立在拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义斗争的最前线。青春的古巴，她不为威胁利诱所动，埋首于国家的经济国防建设，正在逐步清除帝国主义在古巴的各种特权与影响。青春的古巴，她全民一致地向着独立自主富强的道路前进。还没有到古巴之前，就因为这些英雄事迹，使我对她怀有十分敬佩的心情。
      自从5月30日随中国艺术团到古巴进行友好访问演出二十天以来，接触了许多古巴朋友，听到和看到了一些目前古巴社会的实际情况，不由得更使我感到这是个多么有希望的国家！古巴正处在美好的青春时代，处处充满了革命的朝气，她的领袖们有理想，有干劲，团结一致地领导全国人民努力工作。她的人民朴实勤劳，刚强忠厚，兼有拉丁美洲黑人的豪爽热情的性格和优秀的文化传统。今天，他们比过去更甚地具有强烈的民族自尊感和崇高的爱国主义精神，对古巴的前途抱着无限乐观的态度。
    古巴的首都哈瓦那是个美丽的城市。现在，在所有的政府大楼上都飘扬着“无祖国毋宁死”的标语，报纸和电台也不断地宣传着同样的主题。它随时随地提醒着人民准备把自己武装起来，警惕帝国主义的武装干涉阴谋。古巴人民忘不了从革命政府成立一年多以来，美国军事飞机已经侵犯了古巴领空四十多次（据卡斯特罗总理演讲中公布的数字）；有好几次还干了投掷炸弹和机枪扫射的罪恶勾当。当我们赴哈瓦那自由城区机场参观的时候，还看到了一架美国侦察机的残骸，这是十天前打下来的。在我们曾经住过的圣克拉拉城大饭店的十楼餐厅天花板上，处处是美国飞机机枪扫射的痕迹。
    古巴政府的领袖们，革命军人们，迄今保持着打游击时的装束，官兵一样；有很多人还保留了长发大胡子。妇女官员们也大都不施脂粉，衣着朴素大方，以认真严肃的态度进行工作。我发觉他们都很年青。身材魁梧高大的卡斯特罗总理今年才三十二岁，部长们都更年轻，中下级官员们也一样。我们在内地访问演出时，从东方省的圣地亚哥，马埃斯特腊山区根据地拉斯·梅赛第斯军营，乃至卡马圭城，圣克拉拉城等地所见到的党政军领袖们都很年青。哈瓦那国家剧院的院长摩纳尔小姐，以及她的下属们都是二十岁左右的青年。有一位后台主任来奥·罗贝兹自称十七岁，但旁人说他仅仅十五岁；他瘦长的个子，稚气未脱，但在反对巴蒂斯塔的革命斗争中，已在他的家乡圣克拉拉城担负了一部分领导工作。我们看见他工作得很辛苦，劝他争取时间休息，他回答说：“现在不是睡觉的时候，需要工作，我们要急起直追！”他们这股革命干劲很叫人感动；而且几乎这里所有的军政人员，特别是高级官员们，大都十分忙碌，睡眠时间很少。
    到哈瓦那的第一天晚上两点钟左右，我们几乎都睡了，古巴武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗因为白天没有空暇，这时赶到旅馆来访问我们，与陈忠经团长会见，亲切地谈了很长时间。劳尔·卡斯特罗是位杰出的军事家，并且对艺术富有修养与爱好。他对中国艺术团全体团员十分热情友好，在百忙中抽出时间陪同我们参观哈瓦那郊区一个合作社，并和我们非常亲切地在一起吃了午餐。劳尔·卡斯特罗和我谈起古巴的文化艺术发展，被帝国主义的长期侵略中断了；自从革命胜利后，政府便开始挖掘民族民间传统艺术，建立起古巴自己民族的文化艺术工作。他很诚恳地告诉我，现在古巴的文化艺术还严重地存在着商业化的现象，今后要努力清除这种不良的因素。他相信中国艺术团的到来，会对古巴文化艺术的发展有很大帮助和影响。我向他表达了中国艺术家们对古巴民族文化艺术发展十分关怀的心情，和向优秀的古巴民族文化艺术学习的愿望；我们相信古巴的民族文化艺术在革命政府的领导下，一定会有很大的发展。
    古巴的棕榈树长得高高的，树干挺得直直的，不怕风吹雨打，英雄般地屹立着；在碧空白云之下，象征着古巴这个年青的国家站起来了的英姿。在旅行中，我不由得总要多看它几眼；看到它，使我想起这个国家的无数青年英雄们，他们正为了祖国，为了人民干着伟大的事业！
