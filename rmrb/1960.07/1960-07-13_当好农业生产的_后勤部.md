　　Serving as a Good "Logistics Department" for Agricultural Production

In the nationwide movement to support agricultural production, all sectors and trades across the country are contributing their efforts in various ways: some are providing technology to agriculture, some are rushing to produce farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides for agriculture, and some are directly participating in agricultural labor by allocating manpower. As the "logistics department" of production, the financial and trade departments bear even greater responsibilities.

An army needs not only soldiers and weapons to fight but also a constant supply of ammunition and provisions from the logistics department. Without a strong logistics team, it is impossible to guarantee the final victory of the war. Agricultural production, in a sense, is like an army fighting a battle. To strive for a bumper harvest, besides bringing into play the enthusiasm of the people, it is also necessary to continuously replenish various means of production with the changing seasons. Farm tools, pesticides, fertilizers, and irrigation and drainage machinery – the lack of any of these, or the untimely supply of any of these, will affect the bumper harvest of agriculture.

How can we do a good job in "logistics" work? There are many methods, the most important of which is to rely on the masses and launch a large-scale mass movement. With the further development of agricultural technological transformation, agriculture's requirements for means of production have undergone significant changes. In the face of the new situation, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on a few departments or a few people to handle the work of material supply. The financial and trade departments of Chongqing City, in response to the new situation in supply work, launched a large-scale mass movement, mobilizing 100,000 financial and trade workers and a large number of cars and ships to carry out seven vigorous mass "grain delivery" campaigns during the various agricultural production seasons in the first half of this year, delivering large quantities of production materials directly to the front line of production, thereby powerfully supporting the agricultural production increase movement. This fully demonstrated the power of carrying out a large-scale mass movement in "logistics" work.

Under the new situation, the rapid development of agricultural production has led to an increasing variety and quantity of demands for various means of production. So, where do these things come from? The fact that the commercial departments of Henan Province have expanded the sources of supply for means of production tells us that the key is still to rely on the masses and launch a large-scale mass movement. In organizing the sources of supply for means of production, the commercial departments of Henan Province have faced the masses, relied on the numerous commune-run industries of the people's communes, and tried every means to help them develop the production of means of production. As a result, the sources of supply for means of production in the province have greatly increased in the first half of the year, powerfully supporting the agricultural production increase movement. This once again demonstrated the power of carrying out a large-scale mass movement in "logistics" work.

Like the commercial departments of Henan Province and the financial and trade departments of Chongqing City, by launching a large-scale mass movement and fully tapping the potential to support agriculture, and serving as a good "logistics department" for agricultural production, this is the glorious task of all financial and trade departments at present.

### 当好农业生产的“后勤部”

　　当好农业生产的“后勤部”
    在支援农业生产的全民运动中，全国各地各行各业都在各尽所能地贡献着自己的力量：有的为农业提供技术，有的为农业赶制农具、化肥、农药，有的则抽出人力直接参加农业劳动；作为生产的“后勤部”的财贸部门，担负的责任也更加重大了。
    军队要作战，除了要有兵员、武器，还需要后勤部门经常不断地补给充足的弹药粮草，没有一支强大的后勤队伍，就不能保证战争取得最后胜利。农业生产在某种意义上说来也跟军队作战一样，为要争取丰收，除了发挥人的干劲，也还需要随着季节的变化不断地补充各种生产资料，农具、农药、化肥、排灌机械，缺少哪一样，或哪一样供应不及时都会影响农业的丰收。
    怎样才能搞好“后勤”工作？方法可以有很多，最重要的一条是依靠群众，大搞群众运动。随着农业技术改造的进一步发展，农业对生产资料的要求有了很大变化。在新形势面前，如果只靠少数部门、少数人员搞物资供应工作显然是不够的。重庆市财贸部门针对供应工作的新形势，大搞群众运动，动员十万名财贸职工和大批汽车、船只在今年上半年的各个农业生产季节中，开展了七次有声有势的群众性的“送粮”运动，把大批生产资料直接运到生产第一线上，从而有力地支援了农业增产运动，就充分显示了“后勤”工作大搞群众运动的威力。
    在新形势下，农业生产的迅速发展，对各种生产资料的需求不仅品种越来越多，而且数量也越来越大了。那么，这些东西从何而来呢？河南省商业部门扩大生产资料货源的事实告诉我们，关键还是依靠群众，大搞群众运动。河南省商业部门在组织生产资料货源上，面向群众，依靠数量众多的人民公社社办工业，千方百计地帮助他们发展生产资料生产，结果，全省上半年生产资料货源大大增加，有力地支援了农业增产运动。这又一次显示了“后勤”工作大搞群众运动的威力。
    像河南省商业部门和重庆市财贸部门那样，通过大搞群众运动，充分挖掘支援农业的潜力，当好农业生产的“后勤部”，这是当前一切财贸部门的光荣任务。
