Our Taiyuan Dispatch on July 7th: The Luoshuihe Commune in Lingqiu County, located in the loess hilly area of northern Shanxi, experienced a total of forty-two natural disasters, including drought, floods, hail, torrential rains, wind, frost, diseases, and pests, during the First Five-Year Plan. However, because all commune members understood the patterns of these disasters and adopted a "prevention first, two-pronged approach," they overcame the natural disasters and achieved continuous bumper harvests without production cuts, even in the face of adversity. For example, in 1958 and 1959, the commune suffered continuous natural disasters, yet the total output of the entire commune in 1958 increased by 52.5% compared to 1957. In 1959, a year with numerous and severe disasters, the total grain output was slightly less than in 1958, but it was still 16% higher than in 1957, and the total output value was 11% higher than in 1958. From last winter to now, for a full eight and a half months, there has been no heavy snow or soaking rain, representing the worst drought in fifty years. Under this severe drought threat, the commune not only completed the sowing task on time but also ensured that 90% of the land had no missing seedlings.

Understanding the patterns of disaster occurrence through mass-based research and analysis is the prerequisite for the Luoshuihe Commune to overcome natural disasters. Since the Great Leap Forward, cadres and the masses of the Luoshuihe Commune have preliminarily identified the patterns of various major disasters occurring locally: (1) Disasters have a time-sensitive nature; harm is not severe if they don't occur within a specific timeframe. The most feared time for drought is during the heading stage of crops, followed by poor spring moisture that prevents sowing. Late blight generally occurs in July and August, with earlier occurrences being more severe. Hailstorms can be early, mid, or late in the season, with those around the end of heat (处暑) posing the greatest threat. Frost can be spring or autumn frost, with autumn frost around White Dew (白露) being the most severe. (2) Disasters have a regional nature; it's foreseeable which lands are prone to which disasters. Frost follows the pattern of "spring frost on ridges, autumn frost in depressions," with depressions being the areas most severely affected by frost. Hailstorms, due to the mountain terrain, follow a pattern of "dragons traveling old paths." Late blight is most likely to occur in low-lying, damp areas. (3) The degree of damage from disasters varies depending on the crop. Corn and Chinese yam are relatively resistant to hail, frost, and wind, and are referred to by the masses as "insurance crops." However, they each have their own vulnerabilities. Corn is susceptible to drought and waterlogging, and the corn borer is its great enemy. Chinese yam is susceptible to waterlogging, pests, and, even more so, late blight. (4) Even within the same timeframe, on the same land, and with the same crops, the degree of damage varies greatly depending on farming methods such as plowing, sowing, hoeing, drilling, fertilizing, and irrigation. (5) The occurrence of various disasters is directly related to climatic conditions, such as large temperature fluctuations, and rain often accompanied by hail. (6) While all the above conditions for disaster occurrence are important, they are not fundamental. For example, the root cause of late blight is the presence of pathogens. Without pathogens, late blight will not occur even if other conditions are suitable.

Based on understanding these patterns, the Luoshuihe Commune has adopted the following countermeasures for natural disasters by combining the experience of veteran farmers with the application of scientific achievements:

(1) Targeting the time-sensitive nature of disasters, concentrate efforts to prevent and control one or several major disasters within a specific timeframe. For example, in drought resistance, they mainly focus on two crucial periods: spring for sowing and summer for preventing "neck-strangling drought." In addition, they use early planting and early harvesting, as well as controlling or accelerating crop growth, to "play hide-and-seek" with disasters in terms of timing. In recent years, the sowing time for various crops has generally been advanced by ten days to half a month compared to the past. Last year, they also successfully experimented with winter planting of wheat, corn, millet, and sunflowers on over a thousand mu of land. This is of great help in resisting hail, frost, and wind disasters.

(2) Targeting the regional nature of disasters, they have implemented regionalized planting. Drought-resistant crops are not planted in depressions, water-resistant crops are not planted in drylands, Chinese yam is planted less or not at all in damp areas, and hail-resistant Chinese yam and corn are planted extensively along hail-prone routes. Early-maturing crops are planted in areas prone to early frost.

(3) Targeting the different degrees of damage suffered by different crops, they have implemented crop reform and variety improvement along with regionalized planting. They try to plant more disaster-resistant crops and varieties, and expand the planting area of corn, potatoes, and other crops.

(4) Targeting the fact that the degree of damage from disasters varies greatly depending on farming methods, farming methods adapted to disaster prevention and resistance have been forming since the Great Leap Forward.

(5) Targeting the fact that the occurrence and development of various disasters are directly related to weather conditions, and that some symptoms may appear beforehand, they have strengthened weather forecasting and prediction work. The commune has a weather station, the management area has a weather forecasting team, and the production team has liaison officers.

(6) Because the occurrence and development of various disasters have their root causes, they are focusing on addressing the root causes while also addressing the symptoms. This involves changing the natural landscape through large-scale afforestation and farmland water conservancy. For late blight, they first remove diseased seed potatoes, and then promptly discover, isolate, and eliminate central diseased plants that spread pathogens.

Six aspects of understanding patterns and six aspects of countermeasures are all guided by one red line: Whether various disasters can be overcome depends not only on how to treat them after they occur, but more importantly, on how to prevent them before they occur. Based on the disasters that may occur at different times, in different lands, and with different crops, precautions should be taken in a timely and itemized manner in these three aspects:

(1) Ideological preparation. This is the most important. Through continuous education, the broad masses of commune members should realize that regardless of whether there are signs of disaster, all production activities—plowing, hoeing, harvesting, fertilizing, irrigation, etc.—should be carried out from the standpoint of disaster prevention. (2) Organizational preparation. The commune, management area, and production team each form a disaster prevention and resistance committee headed by the secretary, director, and team leader, respectively. Fifteen shock brigades and eighty-eight shock platoons are formed with militia and youth as the backbone. In the absence of disaster, combine with daily production and conduct "reconnaissance" plot by plot according to the "responsibility land" system. Once a disaster shows its head, launch a full-scale attack. (3) Material and technical preparation. This includes checking and repairing projects; preparing seeds and fertilizers; popularizing knowledge of disaster prevention and resistance; and training disaster prevention and resistance teams.

The reason why the Luoshuihe Commune has been able to make all preparations for overcoming various disasters on time and according to plan since the Great Leap Forward is also due to having "two-pronged arrangements." The so-called "two-pronged arrangements" means that after entering summer, when making short-term arrangements, two possibilities are considered simultaneously: what to do if there is no disaster and what to do if there is a disaster. On the one hand, preventive measures that should be taken in advance are included in the plan and treated as equal to current production, ensuring that every item has someone in charge and nothing is left undone. On the other hand, arrangements for production and work leave room for maneuver, without being too rigid, so as to take the initiative in the face of various disasters that may suddenly occur. Truly achieve "bumper harvests in favorable weather, and guaranteed harvests even in disaster." (Attached picture)

    落水河公社掌握自然规律主动防治灾害
    连续战胜各种灾害，做到轻灾丰收重灾保产
    本报太原7日电　地处晋北黄土丘陵区的灵丘县落水河公社，在第一个五年计划期间，旱、涝、雹、洪、风、霜、病、虫等各种自然灾害，共发生过四十二次。但由于全体社员摸清了灾害发生的规律，采取了“防字当先，两套安排”的做法，战胜了自然灾害，实现了遭灾不减产并连年获丰收。例如1958年和1959年连续遭受各种自然灾害，但是1958年全公社总产量比1957年增产52.5％。灾多灾重的1959年，粮食总产量虽比1958年少了一些，但仍比1957年增产16％，总产值比1958年还多11％。从去冬到现在，整整八个半月，没有下过大雪，落过透雨，是五十年来未有的大旱。在这严重的干旱威胁下，这个公社不但按时完成了下种任务，而且90％的地里不缺苗。
    通过群众性的研究分析摸清灾害发生规律，是落水河公社战胜自然灾害的前提。大跃进以来，落水河公社的干部和群众，对本地发生的各种主要灾害的规律已初步摸清：（一）灾害有时间性，不在一定的时间内，就是发生了危害也不严重。旱灾最怕是抽穗时发生，其次是怕春墒不好下不了种。晚疫病一般发生在7、8月，发生的越早越厉害。雹灾有早、中、晚之分，处暑前后的雹灾危害最大。霜灾有春霜、秋霜之分，白露前后的秋霜最为严重。（二）灾害有地区性，那些土地容易受什么灾害可以预见。霜灾是“春霜圪梁（山梁）秋霜洼”，洼地是霜灾最为严重的地区。雹灾因山势地形的关系，形成了“龙行旧道”的规律；晚疫病是下湿低洼地最容易发生。（三）作物不同，灾害的危害程度也不同。玉米、山药比较不怕雹、霜、风，群众称之为“保险庄稼”。但它们各有所怕。玉米怕旱、怕涝，钻心虫是它的大敌人。山药怕涝、怕虫、更怕晚疫病。（四）同样的时间，同样的土地，同样的作物，因耕、种、锄、耧、施肥、使水等耕作方法不同，危害程度也大有差异。（五）各种灾害的发生和气候条件有直接关系，比如冷热变化很大，一下雨就常带雹子。（六）上述发生灾害的条件，虽然都是重要的，但都不是根本的。如晚疫病发生的根本原因是有病菌存在，没有病菌，即使其他条件都适合也不会发生晚疫病。
    在摸清规律的基础上，落水河公社通过总结老农经验和采用科学成果相结合的办法，对自然灾害采用了如下对策：
    （一）针对灾害是有时间性的规律，在一定时间内，集中精力防治一种或几种主要的灾害。如抗旱，他们主要是突击抓两环；春抓下种，夏防“卡脖旱”。另外，还通过早种早收和控制或加速作物生长的办法，和灾害在时间上大打“迷藏战”。近几年来，各种作物的下种时间普遍比过去提前了十天到半月。去年又在一千多亩的面积上冬种小麦、玉米、谷子、向日葵试验成功。这对抗御雹，霜、风灾大有帮助。
    （二）针对灾害是有地区性的这一规律，实行了种植区域化。洼地不种耐旱的，旱地不种耐水的，下湿地不种或少种山药，冰雹打的线路上多种抗雹力强的山药、玉米；落霜早的地多种成熟较早的作物等。
    （三）针对作物不同，受害程度也不同这一规律，在实行种植区域化的同时，还实行了作物改革和品种改选。尽量多种抗灾力强的作物和品种。扩大玉米、山药蛋等播种面积。
    （四）针对耕作方法不同，灾害的危害程度也大有差异的这一规律，大跃进以来，和防灾抗灾相适应的耕作方法正在形成。
    （五）针对各种灾害的发生发展都和天气条件有直接的关系，并且事先都可能出现一些症候的这一规律，他们加强了天气的预测、预报工作，公社有气象哨、管理区有气象预报小组、生产队有联络员。
    （六）由于各种灾害的发生发展有其根本原因，他们在治标的同时，还抓紧治本的工作。是通过大地园林化和耕地水利化改变自然面貌；对晚疫病首先剔除带病种薯，其次是及时发现、封锁和消灭散布带病菌的中心病株。
    六个方面的规律、六个方面的对策，都贯穿着一条红线。就是：各种灾害能不能战胜，不仅要看灾害发生后如何治，更重要的还要看灾害发生前如何防。根据不同时期、不同土地、不同作物可能发生的灾害，事先按时按项从这三个方面预防：
  （一）思想上的准备。这是最重要的。通过不断的教育，使广大社员认识到不管有无灾象，一切生产活动——耕、锄、收、施肥、使水等，都应当站在防灾的立场上去办事。（二）组织上的准备。公社、管理区、生产队，分别以书记、主任、队长为首组成防灾抗灾委员会。以民兵、青年为骨干，组成十五个突击连，八十八个突击排。无灾时，结合日常生产、按照“责任地”制度，逐垅逐块进行“侦察”。灾害一露头，就全力突击。（三）物质技术上的准备。包括工程的检查、修补；种籽、肥料的准备；普及防灾抗灾的知识；训练防灾抗灾的队伍等等。
    落水河公社在大跃进以来所以能够按时按项做好战胜各种灾害的一切准备，还在于有“两套安排”。所谓“两套安排”，就是入夏以后，进行小段安排的时候，同时考虑两个可能，一个是不遭灾怎么办，一个是遭了灾怎么办。一方面，对于应该事前作好的防备工作，都列入计划之内，和当前生产同等看待，作到项项有人管，事事不落空。另一方面，安排生产和工作的时候，留有余地，不打得过死，以便在随时可能突然发生的各种灾害面前，争取主动。真正做到“风调雨顺要丰收，有灾也要保丰收”。（附图片）
