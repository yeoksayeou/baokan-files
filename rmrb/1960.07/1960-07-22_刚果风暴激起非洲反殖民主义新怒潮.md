Xinhua News Agency report: Inspired by the anti-colonialist struggle of the Congolese people, the African people's struggle for independence has gained new momentum. Recently, large-scale mass demonstrations and rallies have occurred in British Kenya and Southern Rhodesia. In the Belgian-administered Ruanda-Urundi and Portuguese Angola, the activities of nationalist organizations have also become more active than in the past.

In Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, more than 10,000 people held a rally on the 17th, braving torrential rain, demanding Kenya's independence.

Gichuru, chairman of the Kenya African National Union, spoke at the meeting, demanding the establishment of an African armed self-defense force to fight against armed colonialism. It is reported that the British colonial government in Kenya has allowed colonialists there to establish a new armed force to intensify the suppression of the Kenyan people's independence movement.

The conference supported the party's demands for Kenya's independence, strengthening the unity of all Africans, and the immediate release of Kenyatta, chairman of the Kenya African Union.

In Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, 3,000 Africans held a large demonstration on the morning of the 20th, protesting the British colonial authorities' arrest on the 19th of Mawema, the interim chairman of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party, Secretary-General Sankange, and Executive Committee member Takawire, on the pretext of violating the "Unlawful Organizations Act."

These angry demonstrators marched towards the Salisbury police station and the residence of the white Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in order to hold protests there. However, they were suppressed halfway by 100 police officers wielding batons and tear gas.

On the night of the 20th, hundreds of demonstrating Africans, disregarding police suppression, stayed up all night, gathering together and singing "Freedom Now" songs, strongly protesting the British colonial authorities' suppression of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party.

After 5:00 a.m. on the 21st, the British colonial authorities dispatched approximately 200 additional reserve police to Harare African Township, the site of the demonstration, to strengthen the suppression. Although the colonial police used tear gas, the demonstrators regrouped after dispersing and continued their demonstration. The police followed and suppressed them, and made arrests.

It is reported that the demonstrators fought back against the colonialists with stones.

A local policeman revealed that from the outbreak of the demonstration on the 20th until 11:00 a.m. on the 21st (local time), the colonial police authorities had arrested 89 Africans.

It is reported that Southern Rhodesia's white Prime Minister Whitehead, in a state of panic, announced on the evening of the 20th that all gatherings were banned in the African areas of Salisbury for three months. In order to strengthen the suppression of Africans, the Salisbury radio station broadcast a conscription order on the evening of the 20th, ordering the colonialist "Territorial Force of the First Battalion of the Royal Rhodesian Regiment" to report immediately. News has it that this colonial force also participated in the atrocities of suppressing Africans on the 21st.

According to a report from Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia, a large demonstration by Africans also broke out in Lusaka on the 20th, with 1,000 people participating. They demanded that the British colonial authorities increase the number of seats for Africans in the Legislative Council and the Executive Council.

Following this demonstration, at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, half of the African workers in Salisbury went on strike to express their strong protest.

On the 19th, in Gwelo, Southern Rhodesia, the British colonial authorities sent police to search the residences of the leaders of this African political party and confiscated the party's documents in order to suppress the party.

The Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party was established in December last year. It once announced that it advocates the elimination of colonialism, racism, and tribalism, and that its goal is to fight for freedom for the people of Southern Rhodesia and establish a democratic government based on the principle of one person, one vote.

In Ruanda-Urundi, the people's struggle is also developing. The Belgian colonial authorities, under the guise of so-called "tribal battles" in Ruanda-Urundi, have transferred at least one company of colonial troops from the Congo to suppress the Ruanda-Urundi national independence movement.

This news was revealed by Van Horn, commander of the United Nations forces in the Congo, when he spoke to reporters in Leopoldville on the 19th. This company of Belgian colonial troops was transferred to Ruanda-Urundi under the pretext of so-called "withdrawal" from the Congo to carry out new suppression missions.

According to news on the 19th, Belgium was scheduled to send two more companies of troops from Brussels to Ruanda-Urundi on that day to strengthen the suppression.

The national independence movement in the Belgian-administered territory of Ruanda-Urundi, which borders the newly independent Congo, is constantly rising. All political parties in Urundi recently unanimously demanded that their country achieve independence on December 27 this year. In Rwanda, the Belgian colonial authorities have taken suppressive measures such as banning gatherings and restricting people's activities.

In Portuguese Angola, according to a report published in the British "Scotsman" on the 19th, the people have recently launched a struggle against the colonialists, inspired by the Congolese people's struggle.

According to this report, the "Movement for the Liberation of the People of Angola" recently issued a declaration demanding immediate official recognition of the Angolan people's right to self-determination. Following this, Portuguese colonialists arrested many Angolans in four cities in Angola bordering southern Congo—Luanda, Malanje, Graça, and Lobito—most of those arrested were railway workers and municipal workers.

The news also said that before and after the Congo's independence, Portugal strengthened its land, sea, and air forces in Angola, and most of the reinforcements were sent to the border bordering the Congo to implement "security" on traffic. (Attached picture)

    刚果风暴激起非洲反殖民主义新怒潮
    怯尼亚万人集会要求独立　南罗得西亚三千人大示威抗议英国殖民镇压
    安哥拉人民发表宣言要求实现自决　乌隆迪各政党要求今年实现独立
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争的鼓舞下，非洲人民争取独立的斗争又有了新的高涨。最近，在英属怯尼亚和南罗得西亚，都出现了大规模的群众示威和集会。在比利时托管地卢安达—乌隆迪和葡属安哥拉，民族主义组织的活动也比过去活跃了。
    在怯尼亚的首府内罗毕，一万多群众17日冒着倾盆大雨举行集会，要求怯尼亚独立。
    怯尼亚非洲民族联盟主席吉丘鲁在大会上发言，要求建立一支非洲人武装自卫队来反对武装的殖民主义者。据报道，怯尼亚英国殖民政府已允许那里的殖民主义者成立一支新的武装部队来加紧镇压怯尼亚人民的独立运动。
    大会支持这个党所提出的关于怯尼亚独立、加强所有非洲人的团结以及立即释放怯尼亚非洲联盟主席肯雅塔的要求。
    在南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里，三千名非洲人20日清晨举行大示威，抗议英国殖民当局在19日以违反“非法组织法案”为借口逮捕了南罗得西亚民族民主党临时主席玛韦马、总书记桑坎吉和执行委员会委员塔卡维雷。
    这些愤怒的示威者的队伍向索耳兹伯里警察局和南罗得西亚白人总理住宅前进，以便在那里举行抗议示威。但是，他们在中途遭到手拿着警棍和催泪弹的一百名警察的镇压。
    20日夜有数百名示威的非洲人不顾警察的镇压，通宵未睡，集合在一起高唱“现在就要自由”的歌曲，强烈抗议英国殖民当局对南罗得西亚民族民主党的镇压。
    21日晨五点过后，英国殖民当局增派了约两百名后备警察到示威地点哈拉尔非洲人市镇加强镇压。虽然殖民警察使用了催泪弹，但是，示威者在散开以后又重新聚集起来，继续示威。警察跟着赶往镇压，并且进行逮捕。
    据报道，示威者曾用石块反击了殖民者。
    当地的一个警察透露，自从20日爆发示威起到21日上午十一时（当地时间）止，殖民警察当局已经逮捕了八十九名非洲人。
    据报道，南罗得西亚白人总理怀特赫德20日晚在惊惶失措之下宣布，在索耳兹伯里的非洲人区，禁止一切集会三个月。为了加强对非洲人的镇压，索耳兹伯里的广播站20日晚广播了一项征召令，要殖民主义者“皇家罗得西营第一团的领地部队”立即前往报到。有消息说，这支殖民部队在21日也参加了对非洲人的镇压暴行。
    另据卢萨卡消息，北罗得西亚首府卢萨卡在20日也爆发了非洲人大示威，参加的达一千人。他们要求英国殖民当局增加非洲人在立法议会和行政会议中的席位。
    继这次示威之后，20日上午九时，索耳兹伯里全城有一半的非洲工人举行了罢工表示强烈抗议。
    19日，在南罗得西亚的格维洛城，英国殖民当局为了镇压这个非洲人政党曾派出警察搜查这个党的领袖们的住宅，并且没收了这个党的文件。
    南罗得西亚民族民主党是在去年12月成立的。它曾经宣布，它主张消灭殖民主义、种族主义和部落主义，它的目标是为南罗得西亚人民争取自由和根据一人一票的原则成立民主政府。
    在卢安达—乌隆迪，人民的斗争也在发展。比利时殖民当局以所谓卢安达—乌隆迪发生“部落战斗”为幌子，已经从刚果抽调至少有一个连的殖民军队前往镇压卢安达—乌隆迪民族独立运动。
    这项消息是在刚果的联合国军队司令范霍恩19日在利奥波德维尔向记者们发表谈话时透露的。这一连比利时殖民军是用所谓从刚果“撤退”的名义转移到卢安达—乌隆迪去从事新的镇压任务的。
    据19日消息说，比利时预定在这一天从布鲁塞尔再增派两个连兵力到卢安达—乌隆迪去加强镇压。
    同新近独立的刚果相接壤的比利时托管地卢安达—乌隆迪的民族独立运动正在不断高涨。乌隆迪各政党最近一致要求，他们的国家在今年12月27日实现独立。在卢安达，比利时殖民当局已经采取禁止集会和限制人民活动等镇压措施。
    在葡属安哥拉，据英国“苏格兰人报”19日登载的一篇报道透露，最近在刚果人民斗争的鼓舞下人民也掀起了反对殖民主义者的斗争。
    据这篇报道说，“争取安哥拉人民解放运动”最近发表了要求立即正式承认安哥拉人民的自决权的宣言。在这之后，葡萄牙殖民主义者在这个同刚果南部边境接壤的安哥拉的四个城市——卢安达、马兰惹、格拉和洛比托——逮捕了许多安哥拉人，大多数被捕的人是铁路职工和市政工作人员。
    消息还说，在刚果取得独立的前后，葡萄牙加强了它在安哥拉的陆、海、空军部队，大部分增援部队被派到同刚果接壤的边界去，对交通往来实行“警戒”。（附图片）
