Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government on July 25 regarding the issue of disarmament. Two days prior, on July 23, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, also wrote letters on this issue to British Prime Minister Macmillan, French President de Gaulle, and Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker.

The Soviet government's note to the U.S. government was delivered by Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Semyonov to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union's Chargé d'Affaires Friars on July 25. This note is a reply to the U.S. Embassy's note of July 2nd.

The Soviet note emphatically points out that the new disarmament plan proposed by the United States is merely a slightly modified and pieced-together version of the old plan that the Western countries presented in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee on March 16th. It is a new attempt to deceive the people of all countries, a smokescreen used to conceal the U.S. government's policy of continuing to expand its armaments, including nuclear weapons.

The note states that, like the Western countries' proposal of March 16th, the U.S. document focuses all attention from the very first stage on establishing extensive verification measures without disarmament, reducing matters to signing an agreement only on this first stage. The U.S. has not suggested any reductions in armed forces in the first stage. The Soviet note emphasizes that, clearly, this is nothing more than collecting intelligence under the guise of international supervision.

The note continues by pointing out that the U.S. proposal completely fails to address the issue of removing foreign bases on other countries' territories and withdrawing foreign troops from these territories. It does not stipulate the destruction of the means of delivering nuclear weapons or the banning of nuclear weapons.

The note says that as for the disarmament measures stipulated for the second and third stages of the disarmament plan, the U.S. plan does not indicate any specific period for the implementation of these two stages, and the transition from the first stage to the second and third stages depends on the realization of a series of other conditions, making it possible to indefinitely delay the implementation of the disarmament plan.

The Soviet note points out that the U.S. government proposes simply resuming empty debates in the Ten-Nation Committee around the U.S.'s "new" plan, but it must be stated frankly that this proposal cannot serve as a basis for negotiations and does not help the work of the committee.

The Soviet note points out that the Soviet government has consistently advocated holding negotiations on pressing international issues; it still believes that the principle of reciprocity helps to explore the issue of disarmament favorably. However, considering the experience of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee in discussing disarmament issues, the question arises as to whether other countries should be brought into the negotiations in addition to those already represented on the committee.

### 苏联就裁军问题复照美国政府  谴责美国用裁军计划掩饰扩军行动

    苏联就裁军问题复照美国政府
    谴责美国用裁军计划掩饰扩军行动
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府7月25日就裁军问题给美国政府一份照会。在这前两天，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫也就这一问题在23日分别写信给英国首相麦克米伦、法国总统戴高乐和加拿大总理迪芬贝克。
    苏联政府致美国政府的照会是苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫在25日交给美国驻苏联大使馆临时代办弗里尔斯的。这份照会是对美国大使馆7月2日照会的答复。
    苏联照会着重指出，美国提出的新裁军计划只不过是把西方国家3月16日在十国裁军委员会中提出的那个老计划略加修改、拼凑而成。它是一个想迷惑各国人民的新企图，是一个烟幕，是用以掩饰美国政府继续扩充军备（包括核武器方面的军备）的方针。
    照会说，美国的文件同西方国家3月16日的建议一样，从第一阶段就把全部注意力集中在建立没有裁军的广泛的监督措施上，把事情归结为只就这第一阶段签定协定。美国没有建议在第一阶段对武装部队作任何裁减。苏联照会强调指出，显然，这只不过是假国际监督之名来收集间谍情报而已。
    照会接着指出，美国的建议完全没有谈到关于撤除在别国领土上的外国基地、从这些领土上撤出外国军队等问题。其中没有规定销毁运送核武器的手段和禁止核武器。
    照会说，至于说到对裁军计划的第二阶段和第三阶段规定的裁军措施，美国的计划没有指出实现这两个阶段的任何具体时期，而从裁军的第一阶段过渡到第二阶段和第三阶段，要取决于其他一系列条件的实现，这样就有可能无限地拖延裁军计划的执行。
    苏联照会指出，美国政府建议在十国委员会中围绕美国的“新”计划简单地恢复空泛的辩论，但是，必须直截了当地说，这个建议不能作为谈判的基础，也无助于委员会的工作。
    苏联照会指出，苏联政府一贯主张就迫切的国际问题举行谈判；它仍然认为，对等原则有助于有利地探讨裁军问题。但是，考虑到十国裁军委员会讨论裁军问题的经验，就产生了这样一个问题：除那些已经在这个委员会中有代表的国家外，还应吸收其他一些国家参加谈判。
