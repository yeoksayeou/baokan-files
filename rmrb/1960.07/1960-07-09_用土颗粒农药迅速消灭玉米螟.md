    Rapidly Eliminate Corn Borers with Soil Granule Pesticides
    Corn Borer Research Group, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    Recently, overwintering corn borers in most areas of North China have generally pupated, and the adult eclosion rate has reached over 80%. Corn borers in the fields have begun to lay eggs. Now is the most suitable time for the first insecticide treatment during the heart leaf stage. It is recommended that all regions take immediate action to eliminate corn borers during the heart leaf stage.
    The best way to control corn borers during the heart leaf stage is to use granular insecticides. Some communes in Shanxi, Hebei and other provinces have been able to manufacture this type of pesticide this year. However, the quantity cannot fully meet the needs of prevention and control. Jin Southeast District of Shanxi Province has widely mobilized the masses, requiring every household to sift ten to twenty catties of soil to make soil granules. This is a good method.
    There are many ways to make soil granules. The simplest is to use clay. First, crush the dry clay and pass it through two sieves (a coarse sieve can be the one used for sifting corn flour, and a fine sieve can be the one used for sifting white flour. Small clods that don't pass through the coarse sieve and fine soil that passes through the fine sieve are not suitable. Only use granules that are neither coarse nor fine.) Add one catty of 6% BHC to every hundred catties of soil granules, mix well, and it can be used. The dosage is six to ten catties per mu. Spreading the granules in the heart leaves of corn has a better insecticidal effect than irrigating the heart with BHC liquid or spraying powder. Two treatments during the peak and end of the corn borer egg-laying period can achieve an effect of over 95%. Tools for spreading granules can be made using empty bottles, waste paper tubes, etc.

    用土颗粒农药迅速消灭玉米螟
    中国农业科学院植物保护研究所玉米螟研究组
    最近，华北大部分地区越冬玉米螟已普遍化蛹，成虫羽化已达80％以上，田间玉米螟已开始产卵，当前正是心叶期第一次药剂防治的最适当时期。建议各地立即行动起来，狠狠把玉米螟害消灭在心叶期。
    在心叶期防治玉米螟最好的方法是利用颗粒杀虫剂。这种药剂今年山西、河北等省有些公社已经能够制造。但是，在数量上还不能完全满足防治的需要。山西晋东南专区普遍发动群众，要求家家筛土一、二十斤，制造土颗粒剂，这是一种好办法。
    制造土颗粒剂的方法有好多种，最简单的是用粘土做。先把干粘土打碎，通过二道筛子（粗筛可用罗玉米面用的筛子，细筛可用罗白面的筛子，通不过粗筛子的小土块和通过细筛子的细土面都不合用，只要不粗不细的颗粒。每一百斤土颗粒加6％六六六一斤，拌匀后就可应用。每亩的用量六至十斤。颗粒剂撒在玉米心叶里，杀虫效果比用六六六液灌心或喷撒粉剂都好。在玉米螟产卵盛期和末期共防治二次，效果能达95％以上。撒颗粒剂使用的工具，可以利用空瓶、废纸筒等制做。
