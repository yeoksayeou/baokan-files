    Focusing on Small Scale, Indigenous Methods, and Full Utilization of Scraps and Waste
    Shenyang's Various Industries Vigorously Grasp Raw Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 8th: To promote production, various sectors in Shenyang are vigorously engaging in comprehensive resource utilization and diversified operations centered on raw material production.
    In the past month or so, the city has expanded, restored, and newly built twelve small iron, copper, and rare metal mines; technically upgraded forty-five small blast furnaces; and newly built over four hundred and forty small factories producing various building materials such as active cement, fiber products, artificial wood, and silicate blocks. More than one hundred factories producing light industrial raw materials such as pulp and wild fibers have been newly put into production. The city has newly established over a thousand small-scale chemical plants primarily producing raw materials such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, coal tar, light oil, benzene, and phenol.
    These newly built small factories and mines are providing various raw materials for the city's machinery, electrical appliances, chemical, light industrial, and other processing and manufacturing industries, as well as basic construction departments.
    Since mid-May, after the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to workers in all sectors to vigorously engage in the "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" for raw material production, and to vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, workers throughout the city immediately joined this movement. In less than a month, workers in Shenyang's machinery manufacturing industry established more than one hundred and fifty small factories producing steel, iron, copper, coke, cement, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and other products.
    The launch of this movement immediately yielded significant results. Many factories and enterprises began to break through the raw material bottleneck, promoting production. Workers at the Tieling Rubber Factory vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, manufacturing thirty-two products such as synthetic rubber and hydrochloric acid, basically solving the problem of raw material shortages in the factory, leading to a substantial increase in production. Workers at the Shenyang Emery Wheel Factory worked hard for seven days to build an electric furnace, producing one to one and a half tons of ferrosilicon daily, supplying it to the Shenyang Foundry, enabling the Shenyang Foundry to overcome the raw material bottleneck and complete the task of manufacturing irrigation and drainage equipment. In the past month or so, the newly established small building materials factories produced more than 30,000 tons of various cement types, more than 11,000 silicate blocks, more than 1,800 tons of fiber products, and more than 500 cubic meters of magnesite products, in addition to a large amount of construction materials such as sand, stone, bricks, and tiles. These materials partially met the needs of basic construction projects.
    In this mass movement to vigorously develop industrial raw materials, Shenyang City conscientiously implemented the Party's "walking on two legs" policy, focusing on running small-scale industries and primarily using indigenous methods, with a gradual transition from "indigenous" to "foreign" methods.
    While vigorously developing raw material industries, Shenyang City also paid special attention to widely promoting new experiences and technologies created by the masses.
    Shenyang's ninety small cement plants all utilize slag and cinder as raw materials based on experiences from other regions or locally. Due to the full utilization of new technologies created by the masses, various enterprises and units quickly set up factories for comprehensive utilization of coal, wastewater, and waste gas, as well as various chemical plants, producing a wide variety of products such as light oil, diesel, ammonia water, and carbon black. Some newly built small iron mines, based on the experience of vigorously developing iron and steel in the past, paid attention to developing towards integrated enterprises from the beginning of construction, not only mining ore but also being able to beneficiate it, sinter it, and smelt it, greatly reducing transportation volume and avoiding the impact on production caused by transportation bottlenecks.
    In the movement to vigorously develop raw material production, Shenyang City, while emphasizing self-reliance, launched extensive large-scale cooperation. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China formed six cooperation committees with the city's industrial bureaus and sixty-four large state-owned factories, cooperating with six counties and districts, providing support in equipment, funds, technology, and other aspects to help build new, restore, expand, and transform small iron mines, small coal mines, and small blast furnaces.

    小型为主土法为主充分利用下脚废物
    沈阳各行各业大抓原材料
    据新华社沈阳8日电　沈阳市各行各业大搞资源综合利用和以生产原材料为中心的多种经营，来促进生产。
    在最近一个多月中，全市扩建、恢复和新建的小铁矿、小铜矿和稀有金属矿达十二座，进行了技术改造的小高炉有四十五座，新建生产活性水泥、纤维制品、人造木材、矽酸盐大块等各种建筑材料的小工厂四百四十多座；新投入生产的纸浆、野生纤维等轻工业原料工厂有一百多座；全市新办起的以生产硫酸、盐酸、烧碱、焦油、轻质油、苯、酚等原料为主的各种小型化工厂达千余座。
    这些新建的小型厂矿，正在为全市机械、电器、化工、轻工等加工制造工业和基本建设部门，提供各种原材料。
    从5月中旬，中共沈阳市委向各行各业职工提出大搞原材料生产的“小土群”、“小洋群”和大搞综合利用、多种经营的号召后，全市各行业职工立即投入了这一运动。沈阳市机械制造工业职工，在不到一个月的功夫，就办起了生产钢、铁、铜、焦炭、水泥、硫酸、烧碱等产品的各种小型工厂一百五十多座。
    这一运动展开后，立即收到了显著的效果。许许多多工厂企业开始冲破了原材料难关，促进了生产。铁岭橡胶厂职工大搞综合利用，制造出合成橡胶、盐酸等三十二种产品，基本解决了本厂原材料不足的问题，使生产得到大幅度增长。沈阳金钢砂厂苦战七天建起了一座电炉，每天生产矽铁一到一吨半，供应给沈阳铸造厂，使沈阳铸造厂破除了原材料难关，完成了制造排灌设备的任务。在最近一个多月中，新办的小型建筑材料厂、生产出各种水泥三万多吨、矽酸盐大块一万一千多块，纤维制品一千八百多吨，菱苦土制品五百多立方米，另外还有大量砂石砖瓦等建筑材料。这些材料，部分地满足了基本建设工程施工的需要。
    沈阳市在这次群众性的大搞工业原材料的运动中，认真贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”方针，以办小型工业为主，以土法为主，“主”的逐步向“洋”的方向过渡。
    在大力发展原材料工业中，沈阳市还特别注意广泛推行群众创造的新经验，新技术。
    沈阳市九十个小型水泥厂，都是利用外地或本地的经验，以炉渣、矿渣作原料进行生产。由于充分利用了群众创造的新技术，因而各个企业单位很迅速地搞起了综合利用煤炭、废水、废气的工厂和各种化工厂，生产出了轻油、柴油、氨水、炭黑等多种多样的产品。一些新建的小铁矿，也根据过去大办钢铁的经验，从开始建设就注意向联合企业方向发展，不单是开采矿石，而且能选矿，能烧结，能冶炼，大大减少了运量，避免了因运输紧张而影响生产。
    沈阳市在大搞原材料生产运动中，在强调自力更生的同时，展开了广泛的大协作。中共沈阳市委把市内各工业局和大型国营工厂六十四个单位，组成了六个协作委员会，分别与六个县、区合作，给予设备、资金、技术等多方面支援，帮助新建、恢复、扩建、改造小铁矿、小煤矿、小高炉。
