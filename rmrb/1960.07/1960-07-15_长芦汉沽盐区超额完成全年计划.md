Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 14th: Salt industry workers in the Changlu Hangu Salt District have already completed 100.1% of the annual national salt production plan by July 1st, an increase of 62% compared to the same period last year. The vast majority of the crude salt produced is Grade A salt.

In order to seize the favorable opportunity for salt drying, win high yields of crude salt, and achieve the goal of "completing the annual plan in half a year," leading cadres at all levels have gone to the forefront of production, setting up headquarters on the salt flats and solving problems on the spot. Zhang Yuhe, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hangu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with the Party Committee Secretaries of various salt fields, based on the principle of making full use of favorable weather and geographical conditions, and focusing on the three key factors of water, brine, and crystallization, summarized fifteen advanced experiences such as "collecting more during bad weather and producing more during good weather." These advanced experiences were quickly promoted in various salt fields.

　　长芦汉沽盐区超额完成全年计划
    据新华社天津14日电　长芦汉沽盐区盐业职工已经在7月1日完成全年国家产盐计划的100.1％，比去年同期增长62％。所产原盐，绝大部分是甲等盐。
    为了抓住晒盐的有利时机，夺取原盐高产，实现“一年计划半年完成”的目标，各级领导干部都走上生产第一线，把司令部设在滩地，到现场解决问题。中共汉沽市委书记处书记张玉和会同各盐场党委书记根据充分利用天时地利的原则，针对水、卤、结（晶）三大关键，总结出“坏天多收，好天多产”等十五项先进经验。这些先进经验很快在各盐场普遍推广。
