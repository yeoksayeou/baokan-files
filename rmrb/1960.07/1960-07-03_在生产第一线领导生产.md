    What problems does this "Ten Moves" solve? Analyzing the content of the "Ten Moves," we can see that it mainly involves changes in three aspects: First, enterprise leaders and management personnel move out of the office and go deep into the field, while also delegating some management authority to the small teams. This resolves the contradiction of disconnection between the upper and lower levels in the past. Second, technical, logistical, and living support work is moved from the "yard" to the "field." This resolves the contradiction of disconnection between the front and rear in the past. Third, each team tries to fix itself to a transportation point and establish direct contact with the consigning unit, thus truly forming a production, transportation, and sales "one-dragon" collaboration, resolving the contradiction of internal and external disconnection in the past. In summary, the "Ten Moves" actually means that all aspects converge on the front line of production to better lead production and better serve production. Therefore, the essence of the "Ten Moves" lies in its further promotion of the leadership style of "going deep among the masses and into reality," and its further implementation of the mass line management method, thereby allowing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to be fully unleashed.

    This leadership style and this management method are precisely what we need to greatly promote today. Today, our socialist construction continues to make comprehensive leaps forward, and all aspects of work are developing rapidly, with the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses reaching unprecedented heights. In this situation, to ensure the continuous leap forward in production, leaders must keep up with the development of the situation, and the first thing they must do is to ensure that their understanding keeps up with the situation. How can leaders keep up with the development of the situation? The fundamental way is for leading comrades to frequently go deep into the front line of production and maintain the most direct and closest contact with the masses and with reality. Only in this way can they timely and profoundly understand the ideological situation of the masses, understand the opinions of the masses and grassroots cadres on production and life, and understand the new situations, new problems, and new experiences that emerge in the movement. At the same time, only by frequently fighting alongside the vast number of workers on the front lines, sharing the same breath and destiny, can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and effectively concentrate the strength and wisdom of the masses to overcome various difficulties and obstacles encountered on the road ahead.

    Going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, participating in production to lead production, and participating in the masses' heated struggles to lead struggles—this is our Party's consistent tradition. And to improve enterprise management, we must first and foremost be able to truly achieve this. Because the mass line is the fundamental line of our socialist enterprise management, and the central issue of enterprise management is how to best combine centralized leadership and large-scale mass movements, unified command and decentralized responsibility, according to the specific circumstances of the time and place, to maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees. Whoever follows the above leadership principles in their work will be able to fully mobilize the masses and promote the continuous leap forward of production. (Excerpt from Beijing Daily)

### 在生产第一线领导生产

    在生产第一线领导生产
    “十搬家”究竟解决一些什么问题？分析一下“十搬家”的内容，可以知道，它主要是三个方面的变化：第一是企业的领导干部和管理人员走出办公室，深入到现场，同时把一部分管理权限下放到小队，这就解决了过去上下脱节的矛盾；第二是技术后勤工作和生活后勤工作由“车场”搬到了“现场”，这就解决了过去前后方脱节的矛盾；第三是各车小队尽可能固定到一个运输点，与托运单位建立直接的联系，这样就真形成了产、运、销一条龙大协作，解决了过去内外脱节的矛盾。“十搬家”，归结起来，实际上就是：各方面会师到生产的第一线，以便于更好地领导生产、更好地服务于生产。因此，“十搬家”的实质在于它进一步发扬了“深入群众、深入实际”的领导作风，进一步贯彻执行了群众路线的管理方法，从而使群众的积极性和创造性得到了最充分的发挥。
    这种领导作风、这种管理方法，正是我们今天需要大大提倡的。今天，我们社会主义建设继续全面跃进，各方面的工作一日千里地向前发展，群众的积极性和创造性空前高涨。在这种形势下，要保证生产的持续跃进，领导必须跟上形势的发展，首先就得使自己的认识跟上形势。怎样才能做到领导跟上形势的发展呢？根本的办法，就是领导同志经常深入到生产第一线去，和群众、和实际保持最直接、最密切的联系，只有这样，才能及时地、深刻地了解群众的思想情况，了解群众和基层干部对于生产和生活的意见，了解运动中出现的新情况、新问题、新经验；同时，也只有经常和广大职工并肩战斗在最前线，同呼吸、共命运，才能把群众的积极性充分地调动起来，把群众的力量和智慧有效地集中起来，去突破前进途中遇到的各种困难和障碍。
    深入群众、深入实际，参加到生产中去领导生产，参加到群众火热的斗争中领导斗争，这是我们党的一贯的传统。而要改进企业管理，首先就要求我们能切实做到这一条。因为群众路线是我们社会主义企业管理的根本路线，企业管理的中心问题，就是如何根据当时当地的情况，把集中领导和大搞群众运动，统一指挥和分级负责最好地结合起来，最大限度地发挥全体职工的积极性、创造性。谁能遵循上述领导原则进行工作，谁就能把群众充分地发动起来，推动生产不断跃进。　　　　　（摘自北京日报）
