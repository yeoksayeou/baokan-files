Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 17th: More than 50 factories under the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Company, which produce parts for automobiles, diesel engines, and tractors, are promoting the spirit of treating the whole nation as a single chess game, and are doing everything possible to increase the production of urgently needed parts such as pistons, piston rings, bearings, oil pumps, and fuel injectors. By the end of June, this industry had used only half a year to produce more products than in the entire previous year, powerfully supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

　　Large factories produce main engines, and these factories produce parts for the main engines. After the automobiles, diesel engines, tractors, and other products produced by the large factories leave the factory, they supply the pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, bearings, oil pumps, fuel injectors and other parts needed for repair and replacement of these products. When discussing this year's production tasks at the beginning of the year, the workers of each factory expressed that they would guarantee to produce whatever the state asked them to produce, and produce as much as the state asked them to produce. The workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory, which cooperates with the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory to produce distributor accessories, had overfulfilled the distributor task required for 250 vehicles per shift by the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory by the end of June. In addition to ensuring the completion of the piston ring parts production task, the workers of the Shanghai Piston Factory also did everything possible to complete the crash tasks from the agricultural sector. At the end of last month, the drought resistance work in Hebei Province was tense, so the factory accepted the task of producing 40,000 diesel engine piston rings for Hebei Province in a crash effort, and most of them have now been delivered.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 17th: From January to the first ten days of July this year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory has manufactured more than 10,000 various parts for rural areas and key enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel.

　　In order to ensure the completion of the temporarily increased production tasks of spare parts and accessories, the factory's Party committee specially transferred cadres to form a command, led by a factory director. In order to overcome the difficulty of incomplete technical data, the technicians also went to various places to collect data to ensure the timely production of these products. In the midst of vigorously grasping the production of parts and accessories, leaders at all levels of the factory often went deep into the front line of production to fully mobilize the masses and tap production potential. In order to break through the difficulties of insufficient personnel and equipment, the workers launched technical innovation and technical revolution, and the factory realized more than 700 major technical innovation projects.

　　一心为大局　自觉当“配角”
　　上海生产汽车等配件超过去年总和　沈阳一工厂制成万余件配件
    据新华社上海17日电　上海市农业机械制造公司所属五十多家为汽车、柴油机、拖拉机生产配件的工厂，发扬全国一盘棋的精神，千方百计增产当前急需的活塞、活塞环、轴瓦、油泵、油嘴等配件。到6月底止，这个行业已用半年时间生产出比去年一年还要多的产品，有力地支援了工农业生产大跃进。
    大厂生产主机，这批工厂就为主机生产配件；大厂生产的汽车、柴油机、拖拉机等出了厂，他们为这些出厂的产品供应修配时需用的活塞、缸套、活塞环、轴承、油泵、油嘴等配件。各厂职工在年初讨论今年的生产任务时就表示，保证国家要我们生产啥就生产啥，要生产多少就生产多少。为长春第一汽车厂协作生产分电器附件的上海第一汽车附件厂职工，到6月底止，全厂就超额完成了长春第一汽车制造厂班产二百五十辆需要的分电器任务。上海活塞厂职工除了保证完成活塞环配件生产任务外，还千方百计完成来自农业部门的突击任务。上月底河北省抗旱工作紧张，这个厂就接受了为河北省突击生产四万片柴油机活塞环的任务，现在大部分已经交货。
    据新华社沈阳17日电　沈阳矿山机器厂今年1月到7月上旬，全厂为各地农村和鞍钢等重点企业制造的各种配件，已达一万多件。
    为了保证完成临时增加的配件备品生产任务，这个工厂党委专门抽调干部组成指挥部，由一个厂长领导这项工作。技术人员为了克服技术资料不全的困难，还分别到各地收集资料来保证这些产品的按时生产。在大抓配件备品生产中，全厂各级领导经常深入生产第一线充分发动群众挖掘生产潜力。为了突破人员设备不足的困难，职工们展开了技术革新技术革命，全厂实现了重大技术革新项目七百多件。
