The vast number of miners fighting on thousands of mines across the country are a main force on China's industrial front. They are using their labor and wisdom to promote the great development of China's mining industry. In the past two years, one of the important reasons why China's iron and steel industry and other industries have been able to achieve continuous high-speed leaps forward is the support and guarantee of the strong rear base of the mining industry. Now, we must continue to leap forward on the basis of the two-year Great Leap Forward, and we must leap forward even better. To make the foundation for advancement more solid, we need to further strengthen the mining industry and place the mining industry in the most important position on the industrial front.

Why do we say this? This is because the mining industry is the root of the entire industry. Everyone knows that the raw materials industry is a basic industry, and the development speed of the raw materials industry largely determines the development speed of the processing industry. For example, the speed of the iron and steel industry has a great impact on the machinery industry, and the speed of the building materials industry has a great impact on capital construction. It can be said that, apart from agriculture, the raw materials industry plays a decisive role in the development speed of the entire industry. However, if we delve further, we will find that the mining industry is the raw material of raw materials. All important raw material industrial sectors, such as iron and steel, coal, non-ferrous metals, petroleum, chemicals, and building materials, rely on the mining industry. (Some departments, such as the coal industry, are almost entirely mining industries.) Strictly speaking, within the raw materials industry, processes such as the smelting of iron and steel and non-ferrous metals, the refining of crude oil, and the calcination of cement, are also processing industries in a certain sense, while mines are 100% raw material bases. It can be seen that the mining industry is the most basic industry. To ensure the continuous and high-speed development of the entire industry, we must first develop the mining industry. This is of particular importance in China. China's industrial development is extremely fast, but the original foundation was very weak, and the reserves of various materials are small. Taking the metallurgical industry as an example, capitalist countries generally use a large amount of scrap steel, scrap iron, and other scrap metal as raw materials. However, China does not have so much scrap equipment to recycle, and can only rely mainly on ore to make steel, iron, copper... In this way, the demand for the mining industry is even greater. Usually, one ton of iron ore is used to make one ton of steel, and two tons of rich ore or three tons of poor ore are needed to make one ton of iron. The proportion of non-ferrous metals is even greater. For example, 70 to 80 tons of ore are needed to refine one ton of lead and zinc, and more than 150 tons of raw ore are needed to refine one ton of copper. Not only that, but coking coal is also needed for iron and steel smelting. About one ton of coking coal is needed to refine one ton of iron, and about two tons of coal are needed to refine one ton of coke. It can be seen that, because the old reactionary ruling class did not leave us any "legacy," and we must continue to leap forward, we have to spend more effort to develop the mining industry.

The mining industry needs to be developed with priority. However, the construction and production growth of the mining industry are generally slower than that of the processing industry. The mining industry is restricted by resource conditions and cannot be built wherever one wants, or whenever one wants. Mineral resources are underground. To find them, clarify their grade, distribution, and reserves, and determine the scale and method of mining, there must be a process of general survey and exploration. Relatively rich and good mineral resources are often in mountainous areas with poor transportation conditions, small populations, and relatively backward economies. To utilize these resources, it is also necessary to carry out a series of tasks such as transportation construction. According to China's current level, it generally takes no more than one year to build a large machinery factory. A large iron ore or coal mine base takes at least two or three years, or even more. These characteristics of the mining industry show that to prioritize the development of the mining industry so that it maintains a reasonable ratio with the processing industry, we must use greater efforts to strengthen the mining industry. At present, China's situation is that the technical level of the processing industry is relatively high and it has more modern equipment, while most mines still lack modern equipment. Therefore, to make the mining industry catch up with the processing industry and move ahead of the processing industry, we must vigorously strengthen the development of the mining industry.

So, how do we strengthen the mining industry?

First, we must strengthen the leadership of the mining industry. Party organizations at all levels and leading cadres on the industrial front should shift more strength to the mining industry. In the arrangement of production and capital construction plans, the mining industry should be placed in the primary position. All industrial departments, especially the railway transportation department, the electric power industry department, and the machinery manufacturing department, must actively support the mines. They must do everything possible to meet the mines' needs for transportation and electricity, and list mine equipment as a priority manufacturing project, according to the spirit of placing the mining industry in the most important position. Only in this way can the mining industry truly be placed in the most important position. Leaders should go deep into the front line, first to the mines, to solve the problems in the mines in a practical and specific way. Where leadership and technical forces are insufficient, cadres should be transferred to strengthen them. To do this, we must first have a correct and full understanding of the strategic significance of the mining industry. It cannot be said that this issue has been resolved in the minds of all leading cadres. Are there not still such phenomena? Many leading cadres who go to iron and steel plants to inspect and check work often stay in the blast furnace and open hearth furnace workshops, but rarely go to the mines. When calculating the production capacity of steel, they often only calculate the smelting capacity of the furnace and do not pay much attention to calculating the supply and transportation capacity of ore. Obviously, to truly strengthen the leadership of the mining industry, we must change this situation. We must advocate going to industrial and mining enterprises to inspect work, and first go to the mines to inspect. This kind of atmosphere must be cultivated from top to bottom.

Second, we must strengthen the technical transformation of existing mines. In the past two years, especially this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in the mining industry have achieved great results. Whether in mining methods, mining tools, ore washing and crushing, in-plant transportation and cooperation with transportation departments, there have been major innovations, and large-scale promotion has been carried out. Therefore, labor efficiency has been greatly improved, and output has been greatly increased. However, at present, in China's mining industry, the output of "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" mines accounts for a large proportion of the total output. For example, coal accounts for one-third, and iron ore accounts for more than half. In these mines, heavy manual labor and backward production tools still account for a considerable proportion. More people are used but the efficiency is not high. In particular, in-plant and out-plant transportation cannot keep up with the production needs of the smelting industry. This situation also exists to varying degrees in large mines. In many modern mines, there are still many manual operation procedures. In terms of transportation, loading and unloading are still the weak links of many large mines. To change this situation, it is necessary to continue to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four modernizations" in all mines. The experience of many advanced mines has proved that mobilizing the masses and adopting self-reliance methods can quickly change the technical appearance of the mines and promote a substantial increase in production. For example, Sifangtai Iron Mine in Hebei Province mobilized the masses to seriously promote advanced experience and realized mechanization by indigenous methods. The ore output from January to May this year increased by about three-quarters compared with the same period last year, while the number of people decreased by more than one-quarter compared with the beginning of the year. Some places organize factories with strong technical forces to support the mines, which is also a good way to accelerate the technical transformation of the mines. For example, Nanjing organized seventeen machinery and instrument factories to directly link up with coal mines to carry out a mass movement to support the mines, which achieved remarkable results. In the technical transformation, the focus of leadership work and mass movements should be on rock drilling, mining, crushing, lifting, in-mine transportation and short-distance transportation between factories and mines. Between "small modern groups" factories and mines, small railways or indigenous railways should be built as much as possible to improve transportation efficiency; in large mines, coal storage and ore storage should be built to speed up loading and unloading. These are the key links that need to be strengthened most at present.

Again, we must strengthen the capital construction of the mining industry. In this regard, we must adhere to the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises. The experience of the two-year Great Leap Forward has proved that the first advantage of small and medium-sized mines is that they require less investment and construction is fast. Generally, they can produce ore in a few months, while "small indigenous groups" hardly need any construction process and can start production as soon as they invest their strength. Even for larger resources, it is more economical and faster to build them gradually from small to large. Second, developing small and medium-sized mines can make full use of resources, and even so-called "chicken nest mines" that have no mining value for large mines can be fully utilized. Third, it is conducive to the rational distribution of industries. Not only can on-site mining and nearby supply avoid long-distance transportation, but also the distribution of mining industries everywhere lays a solid foundation for the further development of local industries. Fourth, it can mobilize the strength of the masses to the greatest extent. As long as the masses do anything, they will be able to do it quickly and well. Most counties in China have mineral resources such as coal and iron. Developing "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" can absorb the widest range of people into this cause. Summarizing the above points, it can be said that focusing on the construction of small and medium-sized mines, especially small mines, is a way to develop the mining industry in a faster, better and more economical way. To achieve a leap in the mining industry in the shortest possible time, we must firmly implement this policy.

When building new small and medium-sized mines (including building small railways between existing factories and mines), special attention must be paid not to compete with agriculture for labor. Anhui Province adopted the method of carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements in existing enterprises to draw people to develop new enterprises. This not only does not affect agriculture (and even draws some employees to support agriculture), but also meets the needs of industry, and is technically easy to handle, which is conducive to the smooth start of production of new enterprises. This is a commendable method and is a basic method that should be adopted in all regions.

In the development of the mining industry, attention should be paid to the comprehensive development of all walks of life to meet the needs of all aspects for mineral raw materials. Not only should coal mines and iron mines be developed, but also various non-ferrous metal mines and non-metallic mines should be developed; not only should existing mineral species be developed, but also new mineral species should be developed. Now, science and technology are developing rapidly, and the new raw materials needed in industry are increasing day by day. At present, China still cannot produce many raw materials by itself. To develop new varieties and make up for "shortcomings," we must rely on our own efforts to become strong and first lay a solid foundation in the mining industry.

Half of this year has passed. To strengthen the mining industry, we need to start immediately. It is hoped that leading comrades at all levels on the industrial front will seize the opportunity, go deep into the mines to solve problems specifically, so that the mining industry will have faster and greater development, and ensure that our industry continues to leap forward on a solid raw material base!

    优先发展采掘工业
    奋战在全国千百座矿山上的广大矿工，是我国工业战线上的一支主力兵团。他们用自己的劳动和智慧，推动了我国采掘工业的大发展。两年来，我国的钢铁工业和其他各项工业所以能够高速度连续跃进，重要的原因之一就是有采掘工业这个坚强的后方基地的支持和保证。现在，我们要在两年大跃进的基础上继续跃进，而且要跃进得更好，要把前进的基础打得更加坚实，这就需要进一步加强采掘工业，并且，把采掘工业放在工业战线最重要的地位。
    为什么这样说呢？这是因为，采掘工业是整个工业的根子。大家都知道原料工业是基本工业，原料工业的发展速度在相当大的程度上决定着加工工业的发展速度。例如，钢铁工业的速度对机械工业有很大影响，建筑材料工业的速度对基本建设有很大影响。可以说，除了农业之外，对整个工业发展速度起决定作用的就是原料工业。但是，如果再进一步深究，我们就会发现采掘工业更是原料的原料。所有重要的原料工业部门，如钢铁、煤炭、有色金属、石油、化工、建筑材料等等，无一不仰赖于采掘工业。（有的部门，如煤炭工业、几乎全部都是采掘工业。）严格地说，在原料工业内部，像钢铁和有色金属的冶炼、原油的炼制、水泥的烧成等等，在一定的意义上也都是加工工业，而矿山才是百分之百的原料基地。由此可见，采掘工业是最基本的工业。要保证整个工业持续地高速度地发展，必须首先发展采掘工业。而这一点在我国更有特殊的重要性。我国的工业发展速度极快，但是原来的底子很薄，各种物资的保有量少。拿冶金工业来说，资本主义国家普遍地大量采用废钢废铁和其他废金属做原料。而我国则没有这么多的废旧设备可以回炉，只能主要依靠矿石来炼钢、炼铁、炼铜……。这样，对采掘工业的需求就更大了。通常，炼一吨钢要用一吨铁，而炼一吨铁就需要两吨富矿或者三吨贫矿。有色金属的比例更大。例如，炼一吨铅、锌要七、八十吨矿石，炼一吨铜需要原矿一百五十吨以上。不仅这样，炼铁炼钢还需要焦炭，炼一吨铁需要焦炭一吨上下，而炼一吨焦炭又需要两吨左右的煤。由此可见，由于旧的反动统治阶级没有给我们留什么“遗产”，而我们又必须要持续跃进，因而就不得不花费更大的力量来发展采掘工业。
    采掘工业需要优先发展。但是，采掘工业的建设和生产的增长一般地要比加工工业慢些。采掘工业受着资源条件的限制，不能想在哪里建设就在哪里建设，想什么时候建设就什么时候建设。矿产资源都在地下，要找到它，弄清它的品位、分布和蕴藏量，确定开采的规模和方法，要有一个普查勘探的过程。而比较丰富、比较好的矿产资源又常常在交通条件较差、人口较少、经济比较落后的山区，要把这些资源利用起来，还要进行交通建设等一系列的工作。按照我国目前的水平，建成一个大型的机械厂，一般地不超过一年。而一个大型的铁矿或煤矿基地，至少要两三年，甚至更多的时间。采掘工业的这些特点说明：要优先发展采掘工业，使之和加工工业保持合理的比例，就必须用更大的力量来加强采掘工业。而目前我国的状况又是加工工业的技术水平比较高，拥有较多的现代化装备，而矿山则大部分还缺乏现代化设备。因此要使采掘工业赶上加工工业，并且走在加工工业的前面，就必须大力加强采掘工业的发展。
    那么，怎样来加强采掘工业呢？
    首先要加强对采掘工业的领导。各级党组织和工业战线的各级领导干部，要把更多的力量转到采掘工业方面来。在生产和基本建设计划的安排上，要把采掘工业放在首要地位。各个工业部门，特别是铁路运输部门、电力工业部门、机械制造部门要积极支援矿山，都要根据把采掘工业放在最重要地位的精神，尽一切可能满足矿山对运输和电力的需要，把矿山设备列为优先制造的项目，只有这样，才算真正把采掘工业放在最重要的地位。领导深入第一线，首先要深入矿山，切实地具体地解决矿山中的问题。领导力量和技术力量不足的地方，要抽调干部去加强它。而要做到这一点，首先要对采掘工业的战略意义有正确的充分的认识。现在不能说这个问题在所有领导干部的思想上都已经解决了。不是还有这样的现象吗？不少领导干部去钢铁厂巡视和检查工作，常常停留在高炉和平炉车间，而很少到矿山去。计算钢铁的生产能力，常常是只计算炉子的冶炼能力，不很重视计算矿石的供应和运输能力。显然，要真正加强对采掘工业的领导，就必须改变这种情况。要提倡到工矿企业检查工作，首先到矿山去检查。上上下下都要养成这种风气。
    其次，要加强现有矿山的技术改造。两年来，特别是今年以来，采掘工业中的技术革新和技术革命运动取得了很大的成绩。无论在采矿方法、采掘工具、矿石的洗选和破碎、厂内运输和同运输部门的协作等等方面，都有重大的创造，并且进行了大规模的推广工作，因此，劳动效率有了很大的提高，产量有了很大的增长。但是，目前我国的采掘工业中，“小洋群”和“小土群”矿山的产量在总产量中占着很大的比重。例如，煤炭要占三分之一，铁矿石要占到一半以上。这些矿山中笨重的体力劳动和落后的生产工具还占有不小的比重，用人较多而效率不高。尤其是厂内和厂外运输，更加赶不上冶炼工业的生产需要。这种状况在大型矿山中也不同程度地存在着。在很多现代化的矿井中，还有不少手工操作的工序。在运输方面，装卸仍然是许多大矿的薄弱环节。为了改变这种状况，需要在所有的矿山中继续开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。很多先进矿山的经验证明，发动群众，采用自力更生的办法，可以很快地改变矿山的技术面貌，促使生产大幅度地上升。例如，河北省四方台铁矿发动群众认真推广先进经验，用土办法实现机械化，今年1到5月的矿石产量比去年同期增加了约四分之三，而人员却比年初减少了四分之一以上。有些地方组织技术力量比较强的工厂支援矿山，也是加速矿山技术改造的好办法。例如南京市组织十七家机械、仪表工厂和煤矿直接挂钩，开展支援矿山的群众运动，取得了显著的成效。在技术改造中，领导工作和群众运动的重点要放在凿岩、采掘、粉碎、提升、矿内运输和厂矿之间的短途运输等环节上。在“小洋群”的厂矿之间，要尽可能修筑小铁路或土铁路，以提高运输效率；在大型矿山中要修筑储煤仓和储矿仓，以加快装卸的速度。这些都是目前最需要加强的关键环节。
    再次，要加强采掘工业的基本建设。在这方面，必须坚持贯彻以中小型为主的方针。两年大跃进的经验证明，中小型矿山第一个优点是投资少，建设快，一般的几个月就可出矿，而“小土群”几乎不要什么建设过程，一投入力量就可以开始生产。即使是较大的资源，也是这样由小到大、逐步建设更为经济、迅速。第二，发展中小型矿山可以充分利用资源，甚至对大型矿山来说根本没有开采价值的所谓“鸡窝矿”都可以得到充分利用。第三，有利于工业的合理布局。不仅就地开采就近供应，可以避免远距离运输；而且到处布下采掘工业的点，就为地方工业进一步的大发展打下了坚实的基础。第四，可以最广泛地动员群众的力量。任何事情只要群众来办，就一定能够办得又快又好。我国绝大部分的县都有煤、铁等矿产资源，发展“小洋群”和“小土群”，就可以把最广泛的群众吸收到这项事业中来。归纳以上各点，可以说，着重建设中小型矿山特别是小型矿山，乃是发展采掘工业的一条多快好省的路。为了在尽可能短的时期内使采掘工业实现一个飞跃，我们必须坚定不移地贯彻执行这个方针。
    在建设新的中小型矿山时（包括在现有厂矿之间修筑小铁路），必须特别注意不要与农业争劳力。安徽省采取在现有企业中开展技术革新和技术革命运动，抽出人来发展新企业的办法，既不影响农业（甚至还抽出一部分职工去支援农业），又满足了工业的需要，而且在技术上驾轻就熟，有利于新企业顺利地投入生产。这是一种值得提倡的方法，是各个地区都应当采用的基本方法。
    在发展采掘工业中，要注意各行各业的全面发展，以满足各方面对矿产原料的需要。不仅要发展煤矿、铁矿，而且要发展各种有色金属矿和非金属矿；不仅要发展已有的矿种，而且要发展新的矿种。现在科学技术一日千里地发展，工业上需要的新的原料材料日益增多。目前我国还有不少原材料不能自己生产。为了发展新的品种，补足“缺门”，我们必须自力更生发奋图强，首先从采掘工业上打下坚实的基础。
    今年已经过去了一半。要加强采掘工业，需要立即动手。希望工业战线上的各级领导同志，抓紧时机，深入到矿山去具体解决问题，使采掘工业有更快更大的发展，保证我们的工业在雄厚的原料基础上，持续不断地向前跃进！
