Watering, Fertilizing, and Eliminating Pests to Strive for More Cotton Bolls
Hebei Launches a Major Campaign in Cotton Field Management

(Our dispatch) Hebei Province's more than one million cotton farmers are vigorously engaged in watering, cultivating, and fertilizing cotton fields to promote rapid cotton growth, early budding, and strive for more pre-autumn cotton bolls. Currently, the province has watered over 3 million mu of cotton fields at the budding stage, fertilized over 1 million mu, and cultivated over 14 million mu.

This year, Hebei Province has experienced drought, with poor soil moisture at planting and continued drought afterwards, leading to severe issues of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Therefore, various localities have launched a tenacious battle of checking and replanting seedlings. Currently, over 50% of the cotton planted in the province has full and strong seedlings, with lush leaves, and is generally budding and flowering. Party committees at all levels have prioritized strengthening cotton field management as a crucial current task. In cotton-producing areas, secretaries are taking the lead and organizing professional cotton field management teams to carry out major campaigns in cotton management. In藁城 (GaoCheng), 束鹿 (ShuLu), 宁晋 (NingJin), 正定 (ZhengDing), 磁县 (CiXian), and 元氏 (YuanShi) six counties, from the county level to the production team, over one hundred secretaries at all levels are taking the lead in directly participating in cotton field management, and over nine thousand professional teams have been organized, with over two hundred thousand laborers assigned to manage cotton fields.

In cotton field management, various localities, adhering to the spirit of focusing on key areas to drive general progress, are concentrating on high-yield plots and cultivating large areas of high-yielding fields. Many places have promoted advanced experiences such as bringing politics, technology, learning, machinery, competitions, and technical guidance and experiments into these plots, adopting a streamlined approach of professional division of labor and collaboration to skillfully manage cotton fields. The Shijiazhuang area, adopting a three-way combination of leaders, technicians, and experienced farmers, has studied and improved cotton field management methods based on the cotton's growth conditions. In previous years, it was generally advocated to suppress seedling growth and delay watering during the seedling stage. This year, due to the drought, early watering is being widely adopted to promote seedling growth. In the past, less or no fertilizer was applied during the seedling stage, but this year, due to slow cotton seedling development, early and more frequent fertilization is being implemented to promote seedling growth. Deep cultivation is also being carried out on a large scale, effectively promoting the normal development of cotton seedlings. GaoCheng County, based on the characteristics of cotton growth, has adopted a comprehensive approach of water, fertilizer, protection, and management. After thirty days of effort, 570,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have achieved three to five fruiting branches and four to six buds.

While focusing on high-yielding fields, Party committees at all levels are also taking measures to upgrade cotton seedlings in general fields, which are growing unevenly, by providing specific water, fertilizer, and management. The GaoCheng County Party Committee, to ensure the watering of over 70,000 mu of cotton fields, organized over one hundred motorized well teams to deepen old wells, dig large-diameter wells, and develop underground water sources through mass movements. ShuLu County, to promote the upgrading of cotton fields in low-yielding areas, transferred four hundred and thirty-nine young commune members with good ideology and strong technical skills from the four communes of 槐树 (HuaiShu), 小樵 (XiaoQiao), etc., which have a foundation in cotton planting, to serve as technical team leaders in production teams with poor cotton planting foundations, to strengthen technical guidance in cotton field management. After the CiXian 成安 (ChengAn) Commune managed the three types of seedlings (deficient in water, fertilizer, and cultivation), over 1,500 mu of third-class seedlings have caught up with first-class seedlings, and are now generally budding and flowering.

During the period of promoting cotton seedling upgrades, various localities have also paid close attention to eliminating pests and diseases. Cities such as Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding, based on the characteristics of more pests and early and rapid pest outbreaks in dry years, have established pest control organizations from the commune to the production team level, seizing the moment when pests are weak and less mobile in their early stages, and adopting the method of treating a patch for every plant, and treating a whole area for every patch, to thoroughly eliminate pests. In order to completely eliminate cotton aphids, Xinle County sprayed all of its cotton fields and the more than one million trees surrounding the cotton fields with pesticides. (Attached picture)

### 浇水追肥除虫力争多座桃  河北开展棉田管理大突击

    浇水追肥除虫力争多座桃
    河北开展棉田管理大突击
    本报讯　河北省各地一百多万棉农，正在大搞棉花浇水、中耕、追肥，以促进棉花快发育，早现蕾，力争多座伏前桃。现在全省已浇棉花现蕾水三百多万亩，追肥一百多万亩，中耕一千四百多万亩。
    今年，河北省干旱，播种时墒情不好，播种后又遇到干旱，缺苗断垅现象很严重。因此各地展开了顽强的查苗补苗战斗。目前全省播种的棉花有50％以上苗全苗壮、株叶肥嫩，普遍现蕾开花。各地党委都把加强棉田管理列为当前的重要任务。各产棉区都由书记挂帅，并组织棉田管理专业队开展棉花管理大突击。藁城、束鹿、宁晋、正定、磁县、元氏六县，从县到生产队，有一百多名各级书记带头直接参加棉田管理外，还组织了九千多个专业队，固定了二十多万名劳力分管棉田。
    在棉田管理中，各地按着狠抓重点带动一般的精神，大抓丰产方，培养大面积高额丰产田。许多地方都推行了政治进方、技术进方、学习进方、机器进方、评比竞赛进方、技术指导、试验进方等先进经验，采取专业分工与协作一条龙的办法，巧管棉田。石家庄地区采用领导、技术人员、老农三结合，根据棉花的生长情况，研究了改进棉田管理方法，往年苗期一般提倡蹲苗、晚浇水，今年天旱，普遍采取早浇水促苗；过去苗期少追肥或不追肥，今年棉苗发育慢，实行早追肥、多追肥，促进幼苗生长；并大搞深中耕，有力促进了棉苗的正常发育。藁城县根据棉花生长特点，采取了水、肥、保、管四项措施一齐上的办法，经过三十天的战斗，目前全县有五十七万亩棉田达到三五个果枝、现蕾四至六个。
    各级党委在大抓高额丰产田的同时，还针对一般田棉苗生长不齐的情况，采取偏水偏肥偏管的措施，大力开展棉苗升级运动。中共藁城县委为保证七万多亩棉田浇水问题，组织了一百多个机井班，展开了旧井锥深，大打大眼井和开挖地下水源的群众运动。束鹿县为促进低产区棉田升级，从有种棉基础的槐树、小樵等四个公社抽调了四百三十九名思想好、技术强的青年社员，到种棉基础差的生产队担任技术队长，加强棉田管理技术指导。磁县成安公社对三类苗（偏水、偏肥、偏中耕）管理以后，已有一千五百多亩三类苗，赶上一类苗，目前已普遍现蕾开花。
    在促进棉苗升级期间，各地还十分注意消灭病虫害。邯郸、石家庄、保定等市，依据旱年虫多、虫害发生早、发生快的特点，从公社到生产队，都建立了除虫组织，抓住虫害幼期活动能力微弱的时刻，采取有一棵治一片，有一片，治一面的办法，彻底消灭虫害。新乐县为把棉蚜消灭干净，把全县的棉田和棉田周围的一百多万棵树，用药剂进行了喷治。（附图片）
