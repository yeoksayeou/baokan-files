Xinhua News Agency: The Baoding region of Hebei Province is carrying out a mass movement to vigorously develop vegetable production. As of July 13, the region had planted 680,000 mu of vegetables, utilized 290,000 mu of idle and barren land for vegetable planting, and intercropped 888,000 mu of grain and cotton fields with vegetables. Xushui County's vegetable planting area has reached more than 180,000 mu, with an average of nearly three fen of vegetable land per person in the county.

　　While planting vegetables on a large scale, various localities have also formed more than 17,000 professional teams to strengthen field management of vegetables. This year, new vegetables are on the market generally 10 days to half a month earlier than in previous years, and the yield per mu has increased by 10% to 30% compared with last year. Various localities, in conjunction with making dried vegetables and collecting wild vegetables, have stored more than 10 million jin of various vegetables. The harvest and storage of vegetables have played a good role in improving people's lives. At present, the average agricultural population in the region eats more than two jin of vegetables per person per day, an increase of 40% compared with the same period last year. According to statistics from seven counties, 3,263 people's commune canteens eat more than three jin of vegetables per person per day, and 3,251 eat about two jin. In Xushui County, 1,113 canteens have achieved a state of mixing grain and vegetables without measuring.

　　According to the Baoding region's vegetable planting plan, this year's vegetable planting area will be expanded to a total of 2.9 million mu. Together with the use of idle land by government agencies, troops stationed in the area, and factories and mines for vegetable planting, as well as the collection of some substitute foods, it is planned to harvest about 13 billion jin of various vegetables, with each person in the region having access to more than 2,000 jin of vegetables. In order to complete this task, the people's communes are now concentrating about 30% of their labor force and adopting various methods such as rushing, intercropping, mixed planting, interplanting, and inserting to expand vegetable planting. Chengguan Commune in Gaoyang County put forward the fighting slogan of "Manage the old vegetable gardens well, plant more in the fields outside the fields, and plant more to ensure high yields," and within three days, 11 melon and vegetable locations appeared on city walls, roads, and embankments. In terms of solving the problem of seeds, various localities have prepared a large number of seeds by mobilizing the masses and sharing what they have.

　　Xinhua News Agency: A mass movement of urban and rural people working together to vigorously grow vegetables is underway in Baotou City. In addition to adopting the method of "a small effort every month, a big effort every season" to strengthen leadership over vegetable production, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Baotou Municipal People's Committee have also established a municipal non-staple food production committee and formulated a production policy of "state-owned enterprises manage bases, enterprises, government agencies, and urban and rural residents ensure self-sufficiency, and people's communes focus on commodity production," which has created an unprecedentedly good situation in vegetable production.

　　This year, Baotou City plans to sow 220,000 mu of vegetables, double the amount in 1959. Currently, the sowing area for spring and summer vegetables has been overfulfilled. Due to the bumper harvest of spring vegetables, the city has been able to eat an average of about one jin of vegetables per person per day in the second quarter, which has always been the off-season for vegetables; commercial departments have also pickled, dried, and processed more than 1 million jin of vegetables with a forward-looking spirit. At present, the people's communes in the suburbs are strengthening field management of summer vegetables. Generally, vegetable fields have been weeded and top-dressed two to three times, and watered four to five times. Furthermore, pest and disease prevention work has been carried out on more than 40,000 mu of summer vegetable land, ensuring that summer vegetables are on the market ahead of schedule and meeting the needs of the people.

　　Recently, while strengthening field management of summer vegetables, Baotou City is concentrating its efforts on preparing for autumn vegetable sowing. Based on the characteristics of Baotou City, which has a short frost-free period and large amounts of wind and sand, the city has proposed that autumn vegetable production must achieve "two earlies and one good" (early sowing, good management, and early marketing). This year, the city plans to sow 126,000 mu of autumn vegetables, with a total output of 650 million jin. In the spirit of planting more and more varieties of vegetables, the people's communes have made arrangements at all levels to strive to complete the sowing area of 180,000 mu of autumn vegetables, with a total output of 800 million jin. The most important problem at present is that drought is widespread due to lack of rain, and the people's communes are combating drought and rushing to sow. Government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, and residents in Baotou City have also launched activities to grow vegetables on a large scale. According to statistics from Donghe District, Qingshan District, and Kundulun District, government agencies, enterprises, and residents plan to sow 20,000 mu of vegetables, and some units have achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency in vegetables.

　　While strengthening vegetable production, Baotou City has also made many improvements in vegetable production and sales compared with the past. According to the principle of "local production, local supply" and the characteristics of vegetables being fresh and tender, having concentrated market supply, and being prone to spoilage, the method of "dividing areas and contracting, linking production and sales" has been widely adopted under the unified management of commercial departments. This reduces the circulation links of transportation, maintains the freshness of commodities, and avoids spoilage. (Attached pictures)

　　抓紧时机　多种种好秋菜
　　保定专区采取抢、套、混、间、插等办法扩种蔬菜
　  包头市城乡人民齐动手力争播种秋菜十八万亩
    本报讯　河北省保定地区开展大搞蔬菜生产的群众运动。到7月13日止，全区已种菜六十八万亩，利用闲散荒地种菜二十九万亩和粮、棉地套作间作蔬菜八十八万八千亩。徐水县种菜面积已达到十八万多亩，全县每人平均占有近三分菜地。
    各地在大种蔬菜的同时，还组成了一万七千多个专业队，加强对蔬菜的田间管理。今年各地新菜上市比往年一般提前十天到半月，亩产量比去年增长10％到30％。各地结合制干菜和采集野菜，已储备各种菜一千多万斤。蔬菜的丰收和储备，对改善人民的生活已起到良好的作用。目前全区农业人口平均每人每天吃菜二斤以上，比去年同期提高40％。据七个县统计，人民公社食堂每人每天吃菜三斤以上的有三千二百六十三个，二斤左右的有三千二百五十一个。徐水县有一千一百一十三个食堂达到粮菜混吃不计量。
    按照保定地区的种菜计划，今年种菜面积共要扩大到二百九十万亩，加上机关、驻军、厂矿利用闲散地种菜以及采集一些代食品，计划收获各种菜一百三十亿斤左右，全区每人占有菜可达二千斤以上。为了完成这一任务，各人民公社现正集中30％左右的劳力，采取抢、套、混、间、插等多种办法扩种蔬菜。高阳县城关公社提出“管好老菜园，大种田外田，多种保高产”的战斗口号，三天内就出现瓜菜城、路、堤十一处。在解决籽种方面，各地通过发动群众，互通有无，筹备了大批籽种。
    本报讯　包头市正在掀起一个城乡齐动手，大种蔬菜的群众运动。中共包头市委和包头市人民委员会除了采取“一月一小抓，一季一大抓”的办法，加强对蔬菜生产的领导外，又成立了市的副食品生产委员会，制订了“国营搞基地，企业、机关和城乡居民保自给，人民公社以商品生产为主”的生产方针，使蔬菜生产出现了空前未有的大好局面。
    今年，包头市计划播种蔬菜二十二万亩，比1959年增加一倍。现在，春菜和夏菜的播种面积，都已分别超额完成。由于春菜丰收，全市在第二季度历来是蔬菜的淡季里，每人每天平均能吃到蔬菜一斤左右；商业部门还根据瞻前顾后的精神，腌制、晒干加工了一百多万斤菜。现在，郊区各人民公社正在加强夏菜田间管理，一般菜田都已锄草、追肥二至三次，浇水四至五次，并且在四万多亩夏菜地里进行了病虫害的防治工作，保证了夏菜提前上市，满足了人民的需要。
    最近，包头市在加强夏菜田间管理的同时，正在集中力量进行秋菜播种工作的准备，根据包头市无霜期短、风沙大的特点，全市已提出在秋菜生产上一定要做到“二早一好”（播种早，管的好，上市早）。全市今年计划播种秋菜十二万六千亩，总产量要达到六亿五千万斤。各人民公社根据大种多种蔬菜的精神，经过层层安排，争取完成秋菜播种面积十八万亩，总产量争取达到八亿斤。当前最主要的问题是，由于缺雨，旱象普遍发生，各人民公社正在抗旱抢播。包头市各机关、厂矿企业和居民也展开了大种蔬菜的活动。据东河区、青山区、昆都仑区的统计，机关、企业和居民计划播种的蔬菜达两万亩，部分单位的蔬菜已达到自给或半自给。
    包头市在加强蔬菜生产的同时，在蔬菜产销方面，也比过去有了许多改进。根据“就地生产、就地供应”的方针和蔬菜鲜嫩、上市量集中、易于腐烂的特点，在商业部门的统一管理下，普遍采取了
  “划片包干，产销挂钩”的办法。这样就减少了拉运的流转环节，保持了商品的鲜嫩，避免了腐烂。（附图片）
