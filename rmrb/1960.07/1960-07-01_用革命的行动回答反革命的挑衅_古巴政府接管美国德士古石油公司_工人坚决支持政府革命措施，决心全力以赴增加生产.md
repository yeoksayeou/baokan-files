Answer the counter-revolutionary provocations with revolutionary actions
The Cuban government takes over the American Texaco Oil Company
Workers firmly support the government's revolutionary measures, determined to go all out to increase production
Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th - The Cuban revolutionary government at 1:00 PM today took over all the factories and equipment of the American Texaco Oil Company in Cuba and placed the company under the control of the Cuban Petroleum Commission.

With the full support of its Cuban workers and technicians, the company has immediately begun refining the country's crude oil.

The Cuban government made the decision to take over the company after the American company defied government orders. The Cuban government had ordered the American Texaco refinery in Santiago, Cuba, to refine the national crude oil sent by the Cuban Petroleum Commission this morning. However, Texaco Oil Company officials, acting on orders from the company's headquarters in the United States, refused to refine the crude oil sent.

Prime Minister Castro recently revealed that American oil monopolies and the U.S. State Department are colluding to threaten to make Cuba a country without fuel, attempting to obstruct the Cuban revolution. Texaco Oil Company has withdrawn more than twenty American technicians from Cuba.

The revolutionary government today appointed receivers for the American company's refinery and for the company's other facilities.

The Cuban National Federation of Petroleum Workers today issued a statement expressing its firm support for the revolutionary government. The petroleum workers congratulate the decision to take over Texaco Oil Company and declare their readiness to implement this decision and to go all out to increase production. The statement condemns the American company's refusal to refine oil as part of a "conspiracy to obstruct the progress of the revolution and make the revolution fail."

When Texaco Oil Company's business office in Havana was taken over, the workers congratulated each other. Workers who were on vacation at the company have already returned to Havana today to await call-up. One worker told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Today is one of the greatest days of the revolution."

    用革命的行动回答反革命的挑衅
    古巴政府接管美国德士古石油公司
    工人坚决支持政府革命措施，决心全力以赴增加生产
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　古巴革命政府今天下午一点钟接管了美国德士古石油公司在古巴的所有厂房设备，并把这家公司置于古巴石油委员会的控制之下。
    这家公司在它的古巴工人和技术人员的全力支持下，已经立即开始精炼国家的原油。
    古巴政府是在这家美国公司违抗政府法令的情况下作出接管的决定的。古巴政府曾命令在古巴圣地亚哥的美国德士古炼油厂提炼古巴石油委员会今天早上送去的国家原油。但是，德士古石油公司的负责人员根据设在美国的总公司的命令，拒绝精炼送去的原油。
    卡斯特罗总理最近揭露，美国石油垄断集团和美国国务院勾结在一起，扬言要使古巴成为没有燃料的国家，妄图阻挠古巴革命。德士古石油公司已从古巴撤回二十多个美国技术人员。
    革命政府今天任命了这家美国公司炼油厂的接收员，并且任命了这家公司其他设施的接收员。
    古巴全国石油工人联合会今天发表声明，表示坚决支持革命政府。石油工人祝贺接管德士古石油公司的这一决定，并且宣布它准备使这个决定得到履行和全力以赴地增加生产。声明谴责美国公司拒绝提炼石油是“阻挠革命前进并使革命失败的阴谋”的组成部分。
    当在哈瓦那的德士古石油公司的营业处被接管时，工人们互相祝贺。这家公司正在度假的工人今天已经回到哈瓦那，听候调用。有一个工人对新华社记者说，“今天是革命最伟大的日子之一”。
