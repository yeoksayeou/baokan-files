Party Secretary's Notes

    A Song of Triumph for Cities Supporting the Countryside
    Luo Rucheng, First Secretary of the CPC Foshan Municipal Committee, Guangdong

    Foshan, Guangdong, located in the fertile Pearl River Delta, is a city with excellent conditions for light industry development. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, industrial production has developed rapidly, the urban population has increased dramatically, and the living standards of the working people have continuously improved. This has made us deeply realize the correctness of "taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy" and the importance of accelerating agricultural technical transformation. Therefore, after industrial production basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization this year, the Municipal Party Committee, aiming at the contradiction that the backward agricultural technology and insufficient labor force in the suburbs seriously affected the development of non-staple food production this year, implemented the spirit of continuous revolution, took advantage of the victorious wind of industrial "four modernizations," used the experience of industrial "four modernizations," mobilized the strength of all walks of life in the city, and in one go, within more than a month, made the three suburban communes basically achieve semi-mechanized production. Although this is only the beginning of the transformation, it has already brought great changes to the countryside: Currently, nine large electric irrigation and drainage stations, five small ones, and five mobile ones have been built on the riverbanks, and the fields have achieved self-flowing irrigation and drainage. In the vast fields, highways and rivers are regularly crisscrossed, and vehicles and boats have basically replaced carrying by shoulders; water for canteens and pig farms is self-flowing, vegetable cutting and feed processing are semi-mechanized, and in many places, steaming and cooking have also achieved local vaporization. Most public places are equipped with electric lights, and the days of longing for electricity and machines to replace labor are gradually being realized. The joy of the peasants is beyond description. They call the power lines "happiness lines" and say, "Worker brothers are omnipotent, install celestial stars to illuminate the villages."
    The city's workers, especially those in the electromechanical and transportation systems, are not only the main force but also the vanguard. They all regard completing tasks at high speed as their greatest glory and happiness. After the shipyard workers rushed to repair 321 wooden boats for Zhangcha Commune in three days, they immediately used two nights and one day to rush to repair 158 wooden boats for Shijiao and Hanshi Communes. The machine repair factory organized a professional team of more than 20 people, planning to manufacture nine drainage and irrigation boats in four days. Everyone hadn't rested for days. One night, the leader of the technician group, Pan Xiang, had a child with a sudden illness and had to go home for a while, but he immediately thought that the diesel engines used for the drainage boats were collected from various communes, and the sizes and models were different. Others were not familiar with them and couldn't install them. He quickly settled his child and ran back. When the installation work was in full swing, it suddenly rained heavily. The workers immediately covered the machines with their clothes and bodies before quickly driving the boats into the shed to avoid the rain. During these fiery days, there were two teams of line workers fighting day and night in the fields. They brought cooking utensils, luggage, and tools, bathed in continuous rain, faced the bitter cold, and slept in the open air. Comrade Tang Qing insisted on working with illness. Everyone also tried every means to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, racing against time to send electricity and happiness to the countryside as soon as possible.
    They did not rely solely on hard work to achieve high speed, but achieved it through skillful work. When the movement entered a climax, the cutting processing of the machinery industry could not keep up. Therefore, a knife-edge and tool innovation movement was immediately launched to demand high speed from advanced knives, high output from cutting edges, to tap potential with skill, and to create high quality with precious knives. As a result, a large number of advanced tools and precious knife generals quickly emerged, and work efficiency was improved by one, two, eight, or ten times, changing the situation. Many large and medium-sized agricultural machines not only had not been produced before, but some had not even been seen, but they were not difficult for them. The "four modernizations" of industry promoted the technical transformation of agriculture, and in the mass movement of industrial support for agricultural technical transformation, the creations of the workers emerged one after another, and new products emerged one after another, which also greatly promoted the development of industrial technological revolution.
    Supporting the suburbs to carry out technical transformation at high speed cannot be done by a batch of professional factories and professional teams alone. This time, 77 factories shared the support tasks. More than 40,000 employees launched a "one good thing per person movement." Finance and trade, culture and education, science and technology, and other industries all directly invested in the movement, according to their characteristics, giving full play to their strengths, truly a hundred flowers blooming, each showing their unique talents. In the whole process, the spirit of communist cooperation has been further developed. When one party has difficulties, all parties support, with many hands and arms, like adding wings to a tiger, not only solving many problems that were originally considered difficult, but also guaranteeing speed. The workers of biscuit factories, wineries, and soy sauce factories used their time after work to build non-staple food processing factories, sulfuric acid factories, and alkali factories for the communes, and helped the communes to set up fertilizer factories. The director of the design office, engineers, construction workers, and farmers jointly planned and designed a "modern pig farm" that did not use wood, saved a lot of materials, and met scientific requirements. The female workers of the cotton textile factory were not to be outdone. In addition to ensuring the production of full red, they also used their spare time to find cotton wadding and rags from the waste warehouse to make toys for the commune's nurseries to express their intentions. Many factories' young apprentices organized saving teams, "clearing warehouses to collect waste materials," and the Guangshui Pump Factory alone recovered more than 160,000 catties of waste steel. Commercial departments vigorously carried out inventory, recovered waste products, and strengthened procurement to provide many raw materials for agricultural technical transformation. Finance and banking departments sent people to the commune to rectify finances, arrange loans, organize savings, and assist poor teams in raising funds. The catering industry also sent chefs and managers to help the canteen, and Xinhua Bookstore promptly supplied a large number of reference books. The culture and education and science and technology departments supported a batch of instrument projectors and also helped the commune to summarize a set of automatic pig raising methods. Everyone is responsible, everyone acts, and the atmosphere is ever-changing. Urban support for the countryside truly has endless potential, which, combined with the superiority of the people's commune's "large and public," forms an indestructible force that is fiercely washing away the backwardness of agricultural technology in the suburbs.
    In the past, Foshan City did not have a mechanical factory. It needed a lot of raw materials from the countryside, and the direct support for agriculture was only wooden buckets, bamboo baskets, hoes, and sickles. In the two years or more of the Great Leap Forward, by implementing the policy of local industry serving agriculture, by all possible means, self-reliance, from scratch, from small to large, steel mills and more than ten electromechanical factories have been newly built, producing water pumps, motors, diesel engines, water turbines, generators, transformers, wires, light bulbs, high and low voltage electrical porcelain, switches, and various medium and small agricultural product processing machinery. Now it is also starting to produce some cultivating machinery and has the ability to support agricultural technical transformation and equip light industry. It not only quickly put the handicraft ancient city on the road of a modern industrial city, but more importantly, this city has also begun to turn to a new stage of planned and active support for the countryside. Although this foundation is still very weak, and the work is just beginning, it is only the first battle, we have clearly seen that Foshan City is striding forward in the direction pointed out by the urban and rural economic and technological revolution!

    城市支援农村的一曲凯歌
    中共广东佛山市委第一书记　罗汝澄
    广东佛山位于经济作物丰茂的珠江三角洲，是轻工业发展条件很好的城市。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，工业生产飞跃发展，城市人口剧增，劳动人民的生活水平不断提高，对工业原料和副食品的需求愈来愈大，这便使我们深刻体会到“发展国民经济以农业为基础”的正确和加速农业技术改造的重要。因此，当今年工业生产基本实现机械化和半机械化生产后，市委便针对郊区农业技术落后劳动力不足，严重影响今年副食品生产发展这一矛盾，贯彻不断革命精神，乘工业“四化”胜利之风，用工业“四化”的经验，调动全市各行各业的力量，一鼓作气，一个多月时间内，使市郊三个公社先后基本实现半机械化生产。尽管这仅是改造的开端，业已使农村面貌起了很大的变化：目前在河岸上，建立起大型电动排灌站九个，小型五个，流动的五个，田地实现排灌自流化，在广阔的田野上，公路和河流有规则地纵横交错着，车船基本代替了肩挑；饭堂和猪场用水自流化，切菜和饲料加工半机械化，许多地方在蒸煮上还实现土蒸气化。大部分公共场所都装上电灯，多少年来渴望电力，机械代人忙的日子逐步实现，农民的喜悦难以形容，他们称电源线路为“幸福线”，还说“工人大哥神通广，装上天星照村庄。”
    全市工人特别是机电和交通系统工人，不仅是主力军，而且还当了急先锋，他们都以高速度完成任务为最大光荣和幸福。造船厂工人曾用三天为张槎公社抢修三百二十一艘木船之后，紧接着又用两晚一天为石角、澖石两个公社抢修一百五十八艘木船。机修厂组织了一支二十多人的专业队伍，计划四天内完成制造九艘排灌和降雨两用船，大伙儿几天没有休息了，有一晚技工组的组长潘享，孩子发急病，不得不回家一转，但他马上又想到排灌船所用柴油机是从各公社筹集上来，大小型号都不一，别人不熟悉便装不下去，他很快把孩子安顿好，又跑回来。当安装工作大忙时，忽然又下起大雨来，工人们立即用自己的衣服和身躯把机器掩盖好，才迅速把船驶进大棚内躲避。在这些火热的日子里，有两支线路工人队伍，日日夜夜战斗在田野上，他们带了炊具、行李、工具，浴着连绵阴雨，迎着凛冽寒潮，露宿风餐，翻山涉水，汤庆工友一直是带病坚持工作，大家还千方百计地克服原料不足的困难，分秒必争地尽快把电源和幸福送到农村。
    他们并不是光靠苦战来达到高速度，而是用巧干实现的。当运动进入高潮，机械行业的切削加工便赶不上去，于是立即开展一个向尖端刀要高速，向刀刃要高产，用巧力挖潜力，用宝刀创优质的刀型刃具革新运动。因之很快便涌现出大批先进刀具和宝刀将，工效一倍、两倍、八倍、十倍地提高，转变了局面。许多大中型农业机械不仅没有生产过，有些还没有见过，但也难不倒他们。工业“四化”推动了农业技术改造，而工业支援农业技术改造的群众运动中，职工们的创造又层出不穷，新产品纷纷涌现，结果也大大促进了工业技术革命的发展。
    支援市郊高速度进行技术改造也不是光靠一批专业工厂和专业队伍所能作到的。这次分担支援任务
  的工厂便有七十七个。四万多职工掀起了“一人一件好事运动”。财贸、文教、科学技术等各行各业都直接投入运动，根据特点，发挥所长，真是百花齐放，各显神通。在整个过程中，共产主义大协作精神又有了进一步发挥，一方困难，百方支援，七手八臂，如虎添翼，不仅使原来许多认为比较困难的问题得到解决，而且保证了速度。饼干厂、酒厂、酱油厂的职工们利用下班后时间为公社建设副食品加工厂、硫酸厂、碱厂，帮助公社办化肥厂。设计室主任、工程师、建筑工人、农民联合策划，设计出不用木材，十分省料而又合乎科学要求的“现代化猪场”。棉织厂女工们也不甘示弱，她们除保证生产满堂红外，还用工余时间，从废料仓中找出棉絮碎布，为公社托儿所造玩具，以表心意。许多工厂的青年徒工们组织了节约队，“清仓攒废料，光水泵厂便抢回十六万多斤废钢铁。商业部门大搞清仓，回收废品，加强采购，为农业技术改造提供许多原材料。财政、银行部门派人到公社整顿财务，安排贷款，组织储蓄，协助穷队筹划资金。饮食业还派出厨师和管理人员帮助食堂，新华书店及时供应大批参考书。文教、科技部门支持一批仪器电映机，还协助公社总结出一套自动化养猪法。人人有责，个个行动，气象万千。城市支援农村真有无穷无尽潜力，与人民公社“一大二公”的优越性汇合起来，便形成一股无坚不摧的威力，正猛烈地冲刷着市郊农业技术落后的陈迹。
    过去，佛山市没有一个机械工厂，向农村要原料多，而直接支援农业的只是木桶竹箩、锄头镰刀之类。在大跃进的两年多来，执行地方工业为农业服务方针，千方百计，自力更生，从无到有，从小到大，便新建了钢铁厂和十多个机电工厂，生产着水泵、马达、柴油机、水轮机、发电机、变压器、电线、灯泡、高低压电瓷、开关、各种中小型农产品加工机械。现在还着手生产部分耕耘机械，具备了一定的支援农业技术改造和装备轻工业的能力。不但迅速使手工业古城走上现代工业城市的道路，更重要是这个城市也开始转上有计划地、主动地支援农村的新的阶段。虽然这个基础还很薄弱，工作正开始做，才是第一仗，但是，我们已清楚地看到：佛山市正沿着城乡经济技术革命所指引的方向，阔步前进！
