Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: Zhang Weilie, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, paid a visit to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik at 10:00 AM on July 6, 1960, and personally delivered the Chinese Government's reply note, dated July 5, 1960, to the Soviet Government's note of June 27, 1960, regarding the disarmament issue. The full text is as follows:

    The Government of the People's Republic of China has received the note from the Soviet Government dated June 27, 1960, and has given full consideration to the opinions expressed therein by the Soviet Government.
    Disarmament is the common aspiration of the people of all countries and an important measure for safeguarding world peace at the present time. The Soviet Government has put forward positive proposals on many occasions in order to promote a solution to the disarmament issue. The Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently given strong support to the various disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Government.
    Since the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee began its work, the Soviet Union has made repeated and significant efforts to reach an agreement with the United States and other Western countries on the issue of disarmament. The Soviet Union took the initiative in deciding to reduce its own armed forces by one-third. On June 2 of this year, the Soviet Government also put forward new proposals for complete and thorough disarmament, advocating disarmament in stages and the implementation of supervision on the basis of disarmament. However, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, refused to engage in substantive discussions on the new Soviet proposals; they attempted to make the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee discuss their proposals for supervision and inspection without disarmament, in order to achieve their dirty aim of carrying out espionage activities against socialist countries. Moreover, while negotiating disarmament, US imperialism has intensified its activities in expanding armaments and preparing for war. It is clear to the whole world that it was precisely at this time that the United States passed the aggressive US-Japan military alliance treaty. This once again vividly proves that the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, have no desire for disarmament. Under these circumstances, as the Soviet Government stated in its note, if the Soviet Union and other socialist countries continue to talk with the United States and other Western countries in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, it would be tantamount to participating in deceiving the people, and this is absolutely unacceptable to socialist countries.
    The actions of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in ceasing to participate in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee have further exposed the deceptive conspiracy of the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, to cover up their arms expansion and war preparations with empty talk of disarmament. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports this solemn step taken by the Soviet Government.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated general disarmament and has made unremitting efforts to promote it. Since 1951, China has repeatedly taken the initiative to reduce its own armed forces. We have voluntarily withdrawn the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. We have repeatedly proposed that all countries in Asia and the Pacific region conclude a non-aggression peace pact and make this region a nuclear-free zone. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that only by continuously strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, uniting the peace-loving people and countries of the world, and carrying out a resolute struggle against the arms expansion and war preparations of imperialism headed by the United States, so that the imperialist countries understand that continuing to oppose disarmament is detrimental to them, can they be forced to sit down for serious disarmament negotiations. The Government of the People's Republic of China agrees with the Soviet Government's proposal to continue disarmament negotiations and will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the peace-loving people and countries of the world, wage an unremitting struggle against the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, for the realization of general disarmament and the maintenance of world peace.

    我国政府就裁军问题复照苏联政府
    苏联和其他社会主义国家停止参加十国裁军委员会的行动，进一步揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义国家以裁军空谈掩盖扩军备战的欺骗阴谋。中国政府完全支持苏联这一严正步骤。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　中华人民共和国驻苏联大使馆临时代办张伟烈于1960年7月6日上午十时拜会了苏联外交部副部长马立克，当面递交了中华人民共和国政府1960年7月5日对苏联政府1960年6月27日就裁军问题致中华人民共和国政府照会的复照。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府收到了苏联政府1960年6月27日的照会，充分地注意到了苏联政府在该照会内所表示的各项意见。
    裁军是世界各国人民的共同愿望，是当前维护世界和平的一个重要措施。苏联政府为了促使裁军问题的解决，曾经多次提出积极的建议。中华人民共和国政府对苏联政府历次提出的裁军建议，一贯地给予有力的支持。
    自从十国裁军委员会开始工作以来，苏联为了争取同美国等西方国家就裁军问题达成协议，曾经一再作出重大的努力。苏联主动决定裁减自己的武装部队三分之一。苏联政府在本年6月2日又提出了全面彻底裁军的新建议，主张分阶段裁军和在裁军的基础上实施监督。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义国家却拒绝对苏联的新建议进行实质性的讨论；他们力图使十国裁军委员会讨论他们提出的没有裁军的监督和视察的建议，以达到他们对社会主义国家进行间谍活动的肮脏目的。不仅如此，美帝国主义在谈判裁军的同时，还加紧扩军备战的活动。全世界都清楚，正是在这个时候，美国通过了侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。这就再一次生动地证明了，以美国为首的帝国主义国家没有裁军的愿望。在这种情况下，正如苏联政府来照中所说的，如果苏联和其他社会主义国家继续在十国裁军委员会中同美国和其他西方国家谈下去就等于参与欺骗人民，而这是社会主义国家所绝对不能同意的。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家停止参加十国裁军委员会的行动，进一步揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义国家以裁军的空谈掩盖扩军备战的欺骗阴谋。中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联政府所采取的这一严正步骤。
    中华人民共和国政府一贯主张普遍裁军，并且为了促进普遍裁军进行了不懈的努力。从1951年起，中国就一再主动地裁减自己的武装部队。我们主动地从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军。我们一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无原子区。中华人民共和国政府认为，只有不断壮大以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，团结全世界爱好和平的人民和国家，同以美国为首的帝国主义的扩军备战活动进行坚决的斗争，使帝国主义国家懂得继续反对裁军是对他们不利的，才能迫使他们坐下来进行认真的裁军谈判。中华人民共和国政府赞同苏联政府准备继续进行裁军谈判的主张，并且将同苏联和其他社会主义国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民和国家一道，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为实现普遍裁军和维护世界和平而进行不懈的斗争。
