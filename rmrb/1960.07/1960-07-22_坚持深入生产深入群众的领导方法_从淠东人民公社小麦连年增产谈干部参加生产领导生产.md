    Persist in the Leadership Method of Going Deep into Production and Deep into the Masses
    Talking about Cadres Participating in Production and Leading Production from the Consecutive Years of Wheat Production Increase in the Pi-Dong People's Commune
    Du Weiyou, First Secretary of the Liu'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui Province

    The Great Benefits of Cadres Participating in Production and Leading Production
    Since 1958, the Pi-Dong People's Commune in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, has continuously won the provincial red flag for large-scale wheat production increases. The commune started with 9.6 mu of high-yield wheat fields in 1953, expanding to 2,200 mu in 1958, 2,900 mu in 1959, and further to 34,800 mu this year. This year, the unit area yield has increased by 1.3 times compared to 1953, which is not only a great leap forward but also an extraordinary one. The basic reasons for achieving the above results, in addition to conscientiously implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction and fully utilizing the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune, are also inseparable from the Pi-Dong People's Commune cadres improving their work style in a down-to-earth manner, participating in production, leading production, going deep among the masses, and relying on the masses.
    Pi-Dong People's Commune cadres began planting high-yield wheat fields, participating in production, and leading production as early as 1953. Especially after the Party Central Committee issued instructions in 1957 for cadres to plant experimental fields, cadres' participation in production and leadership of production became institutionalized. At that time, it was stipulated that township and commune cadres should participate in production for five to seven days every ten days; township and commune cadres would bring tools when going down to inspect production, and production team cadres would carry manure baskets when going to townships and communes for meetings; in 1958, attendance systems and half-day systems were successively established, leading to the current "two-five system." The commune Party committee secretary and brigade general branch secretaries, except when attending meetings above, spend 60% to 70% of their time participating in production. Production team branch secretaries, except when attending meetings and learning above, spend almost all their time participating in production. With the Party committee secretary taking the lead, cadres' participation in production has become the fashion throughout the commune. From the Party committee to various departments, from leaders to technicians and accountants, everyone loves labor and participates in production. Except for a few financial and accounting personnel who remain in the office to maintain essential work, every cadre in the commune and brigades is assigned to a team, treating the team as their home, participating in production, and leading production, gradually becoming experts in production. For example, women cadres such as the commune's women's federation director and production team women's captains, who in the past only knew how to do some minor and simple farm work, have now, after several years of production training, made wheat production their "forte," and they can do everything from deep plowing and land preparation to seed selection and sowing.

    In-depth and Detailed Summarization of the Masses' Production Experience
    Practice over the years has shown that cadres' participation in production can maintain a spirit of continuous revolution, deeply and meticulously summarize the production experience of the masses, innovate agricultural science and technology, and improve agricultural production. The wheat production technology of the Pi-Dong People's Commune is not rigid. Whether in deep plowing and land preparation, seed selection and sowing, fertilization and irrigation, or prevention of lodging and pests, new technologies are constantly innovated with the development of production, creating a relatively complete set of experiences. For example, in terms of fertilization: from applying basal fertilizer in layers and in concentrated amounts, to applying top dressing fertilizer sparingly and frequently, to skillfully applying top dressing fertilizer by frequently checking four aspects, this year's summary is four coordinations (i.e., coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, coordination of organic and inorganic fertilizers, coordination of water and fertilizer and dry fertilizer, coordination of coarse fertilizer and fine fertilizer), and three combinations (i.e., combining fertilization with irrigation, combining fertilization with frost prevention, combining fertilization with soil improvement), to achieve rational fertilization and multiple benefits from one fertilizer application. The reason why they can create these new experiences is precisely the result of participating in production and leading production. They first act as students of the masses, taking the masses as their teachers, learning from the masses, and then, after painstaking research, act as teachers of the masses, creating new experiences from the old experiences of the masses. In the autumn planting of 1957, Gui Jingyuan, the secretary of the Pi-Dong Brigade Party General Branch, participated in autumn planting in the Yingwan Production Team and discovered that the masses had the experience that "if wheat is given enough manure at the base, there will definitely be a good harvest next year." Moreover, an old farmer said, "Wheat is something that is rich from birth. When wheat seeds are planted, it is best to have padding, covering, food, and drink." Comrade Gui Jingyuan adopted these experiences of the masses and proposed applying water manure along the sowing width before sowing to make a padding ditch fertilizer; after sowing, using ash manure and fine pond mud to make a covering fertilizer, so that the wheat was given enough basal fertilizer. However, some cadres had the illusion that the more fertilizer applied, the better. Liang Xunzhong, the secretary of the Guanmiao Production Team branch, planted one mu of wheat experimental field and applied four top dressings in quick succession after sowing. An old farmer saw this and suggested, "Fertilizer should not be applied too suddenly, you can't get a fat baby in one bite, it should be applied in stages." During the summer harvest in 1958, the cadres summarized these experiences of the masses as "applying basal fertilizer in layers and in concentrated amounts, and applying top dressing fertilizer sparingly and frequently." In the autumn planting of 1958, the commune Party committee comprehensively promoted this experience, and in the process of promotion, absorbed the opinions of the masses, so that this experience was continuously developed and improved. In the winter management of wheat, once the commune cadres led the commune members to apply human and animal manure to a class of wheat seedlings. At that time, some old farmers suggested, "These wheat seedlings are already very delicate, and applying human and animal manure again will cause them to grow wildly and suffer frost damage. Some pot wall soil and wood ash should be applied." The commune cadres accepted this suggestion and applied a pressure fertilizer once. In this way, the commune Party committee concentrated the opinions of the masses in the process of promotion and put forward the four-seeing fertilization method of looking at seedlings, looking at the weather, looking at the soil, and looking at the season. In this year's wheat production, the cadres and commune members systematically summarized the wheat fertilization experience of the past few years and came up with a relatively complete set of scientific fertilization methods of "four coordinations" and "three combinations." From the continuous discovery and absorption of the production experience of the masses, the cadres of the Pi-Dong People's Commune realized that the improvement of agricultural production technology is endless, and the increase in production is endless, thereby constantly overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking of various periods, and with a spirit of continuous revolution, they often summarize the experiences of the masses bit by bit, elevate them to scientific theories, and continuously push agricultural science and technology to new levels, realizing the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. This fact vividly proves that cadres' participation in production can better follow Chairman Mao's instructions of the working method of "from the masses, to the masses," and can often overcome the conservative thinking of cadres, and lead production with a spirit of continuous revolution.

    Correctly and Comprehensively Implement the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture
    Cadres' participation in production can drive the broad masses of commune members with their own exemplary actions, correctly and comprehensively implement the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture according to local conditions and with a clear understanding, and deeply and specifically lead agricultural production. The cadres of the Pi-Dong People's Commune have this experience: if they don't understand the technical measures, they should learn them first; if the masses' thinking is not clear, they should do it themselves first. In the recent years of wheat production, from planting to harvesting, every link, they have implemented the Eight-Character Charter in a self-sacrificing manner, making sure that every word is closely followed, not missing a single word, and attacking one checkpoint after another until the final victory. In 1959, in order to ensure the quality of autumn planting, the commune Party committee, based on years of experience, proposed the standard of deep plowing to eight inches, sowing with three fertilizers (padding ditch fertilizer, seed mixing fertilizer, covering fertilizer), and seeds evenly distributed inch by inch (wheat seeds evenly distributed within the sowing width). At the beginning, some commune members lacked confidence and said, "To achieve such a high standard, unless the seven fairies come down to earth." The commune Party committee decided to first set an example for the commune members to see. From the experimental fields and command fields of cadres at all levels from the commune Party committee secretary to the production team branch secretaries, they all carefully cultivated and worked without any discount according to the requirements of the standard. The broad masses of commune members were encouraged and educated by the exemplary actions of the cadres, thereby understanding with their mouths, hearts, and hands, and trying every means to improve the quality of autumn planting, laying a solid foundation for this year's substantial increase in wheat production.
    The Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture is a universal truth for increasing agricultural production. In its implementation, it must be combined with specific circumstances. In a region, a field, a crop, how to specifically implement it requires going deep into reality, going deep among the masses, and discussing, implementing, and taking responsibility together with the masses. One of the important keys to the consecutive years of wheat production increase in the Pi-Dong People's Commune lies in finding a dense planting specification suitable for local conditions, and at the same time solving various production increase measures related to dense planting. This reasonable dense planting specification was also derived by cadres from long-term participation in production. Before the autumn of 1958, the issue of dense planting had not been resolved. At that time, some cadres and masses had two opinions on the degree of dense planting of wheat. One opinion was that the denser the better, advocating an unlimited increase in the amount of sowing; the other opinion was that the sparser the better, advocating a return to the old path of sparse planting in the past. At that time, the commune Party committee, on the one hand, summarized the experience of its own experimental wheat fields in dense planting over the past few years, and on the other hand, participated in autumn planting preparations together with the commune members. During breaks, it mobilized the commune members to discuss how much wheat should be sown, how wide the row spacing and sowing width should be to be considered reasonable dense planting, and so on. The commune members were very concerned about this major production increase measure of dense planting. While working, they debated, truly expressing their opinions and speaking freely. Some old farmers, although sweating profusely from labor, debated until their faces were red and they refused to give up. Based on their own direct experience in wheat experimental fields and the correct opinions of the majority of the masses, the commune Party committee negated the two biases of the denser the better and the sparser the better, and proposed an appropriate dense planting standard, and separately proposed different dense planting specifications according to different conditions such as soil, seed, and time, thereby establishing the dense planting specification on a solid and reliable basis, preventing the tendency of uniformity, and therefore, to a large extent, exerting the production increase effect of dense planting.

    Timely Discovery and Resolution of New Problems Occurring in Production and Among the Masses
    Cadres' participation in production enables them to see through, grasp, discover early, and resolve quickly some of the problems in production. When the wheat was turning green this year, more than 1,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields in the Pi-Dong Brigade were growing exceptionally well. Looking out, it was a lush green. The inspection team conducted several field inspections and believed that there was no need to apply more fertilizer. Later, Gui Jingyuan, the secretary of the brigade Party general branch, participated in the work of clearing ditches and weeding in this area. After a whole day of work, he found that among the large area of wheat seedlings, some wheat seedlings had pale green leaves and a tendency to fall behind. He immediately took the method of checking each plant one by one, inserting a marker for each plant, applying fertilizer to plants with markers, and removing the markers after fertilization, and applied interplanting fertilizer, ensuring the even growth of the large area of wheat seedlings. This fact vividly proves that cadres' participation in production can change the situation of vague understanding and seeing flowers in a fog, and timely discover and solve problems in production. Commune members reflected: "The problems in production in our commune cannot last overnight."
    Cadres' participation in production allows them to understand the situation of the masses at any time, timely solve the difficulties in the lives of the masses, and further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses. Although our rural cadres all come from the working people and have a natural close connection with the working masses, if they do not participate in production for a long time after becoming cadres, they will gradually become alienated from the masses, creating the danger of being divorced from the masses. Cadres and commune members produce together, come and go together, talk and laugh together, which can further establish the viewpoint of serving the people. Many cadres in the Pi-Dong People's Commune have made close friends with commune members in production, their hearts are connected, and their pulses are connected. "Confidential words are told to confidants." The commune members tell the cadres everything they know, and the cadres are considerate to the commune members, forming a close relationship like fish and water, creating a political situation that is relaxed, lively, and vigorous. Zhang Jinxuan, the secretary of the Shi-Tan Brigade Party general branch, participated in labor with commune members in this year's summer harvest and found that commune member Pan Xinzhi was silent and seemed to have something on his mind. Comrade Zhang Jinxuan talked to him while working. Through the conversation, he learned that his house had been damaged by the storm last time and had not been repaired, and his child was sick and had not been treated. Zhang Jinxuan immediately helped him invite a doctor to cure the child's illness; at the same time, he arranged for labor to help him repair the house. Pan Xinzhi said with emotion: "Secretary Zhang is so caring and considerate to the commune members, he is really a good cadre of Chairman Mao."
    In short, practice has proven that cadres' participation in production is the best way to go deep into the front line of production, an effective method to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, and a major principle of adhering to the Party's mass line working method. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly called on all Party cadres to serve the people wholeheartedly and never be divorced from the masses for a moment; they must go to the masses, go to the heat of struggle, participate in the struggle, and lead the struggle. Cadres participating in production and leading production is an important measure to implement Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership style and leadership method. Therefore, we must summarize experience, overcome shortcomings, and better participate in production and lead production.

    Several Issues That Must Be Seriously Resolved
    How can we better participate in production and lead production? According to the experience of the Pi-Dong People's Commune, the following issues must be seriously resolved:

    There Must Be a Clear Purpose
    There must be a clear purpose, that is, to better lead production through participation in production. On this issue, there were two situations in the Pi-Dong People's Commune at the beginning. One was that the purpose was clear, paying great attention to leading production through production, so the production wherever the cadres participated in became a vigorous and colorful activity; the other was that the purpose was not clear, only knowing to participate in production, but not knowing that it was more important to better lead production through production. Some cadres regarded participation in production as a simple task, only playing the role of a labor force, only knowing to be a combatant, forgetting that they were also a commander, thinking that participating in production was all right, and rarely considering the overall work, and often knew nothing about the overall situation of production. Therefore, we must repeatedly explain the purpose of participating in production to the cadres, on the one hand, encourage their enthusiasm for participating in production, and on the other hand, enlighten and guide them to better play their comprehensive leadership role in participating in production.

    Establish a Correct Attitude Towards Labor
    Participating in production and leading production also requires a correct attitude towards labor and the promotion of the fine style of hard work and plain living. There are also two different situations in the attitude towards labor. One is to participate in production with the attitude of ordinary workers, eating, living, and working with the commune members, without any special treatment, without any airs, so after they participate in production, there are soon three climaxes: a climax of cadres and commune members talking heart to heart, a climax of commune members reflecting the situation, and a climax of production; one is that they cannot put down their airs, regarding themselves as leaders, and before they even break a sweat, they point fingers, make comments, make suggestions, criticize this, and accuse that, and in life they show special treatment, and in production they choose easy tasks and avoid difficult tasks, working here for a while and doing three things there, the commune members criticize them for being "running marshals," unable to sit still like their butts are on fire, unable to take root like floating duckweed, so they cannot truly integrate with the masses, cannot discover problems in production, and naturally cannot lead production through production.

    Adopt the Method of "Three Combinations"
    Adopting the method of "three combinations" can better achieve the effect of participating in production and leading production.
    1. Combination of hand and brain. Cadres participating in production and leading production should use both hands and brains, and think more about problems in production, so that they can see through the phenomena of things, discover the essence of things, and grasp the key to solving problems in production. Only by using both hands and brains, doing while watching, listening while thinking, can we have a panoramic view of the problems in work, production, and the thinking of the masses, be keenly aware of the details, be good at grasping the crux of the problem, study practical and feasible solutions, and make the problems be solved quickly. Comrade Yu Minglu, the secretary of the commune Party committee, participated in wheat field management in the Xin-Sheng Production Team of the Nianbu Brigade this spring and found that the wheat seedlings were yellow. He asked the branch secretary what the reason was, and the branch secretary said: It was because the labor force had gone to water conservancy and there was a lack of labor force management. At that time, Comrade Yu Minglu thought that the number of people in this team participating in water conservancy construction was not more than that of other teams, so why were the wheat seedlings growing worse than other teams? There must be another reason. So he lined up the commune members one by one and accounted for the labor force occupied by each department. The result of the lining up and accounting was that too many people were used in the life and welfare undertakings. There were 52 whole and half laborers at home, and only 36 people participated in agricultural attendance. More than 10 people were occupied in the life and welfare undertakings; at the same time, it was found that some commune members had a paralyzing and complacent attitude towards wheat management, saying: It is well planted, it has a good foundation, and it will still have 70% harvest even if it is not managed. Based on this situation, on the one hand, the number of people used in the life and welfare organizations was streamlined; on the other hand, the importance of wheat management was strengthened to the commune members, and the commune members' understanding was improved, which greatly boosted the commune members' enthusiasm, so that this team completed the weeding and top dressing work in the wheat greening stage in time, and promoted the vigorous growth of wheat.

    2. Combination of point and area. Chairman Mao often warned us that we should be good at using the leadership method of combining point and area and combining individual and general. This is especially important for cadres' participation in production. After cadres participate in production, the leadership of the point is strengthened, but only by spreading the experience created at the key point can it play a guiding role in the overall production. By going deep into production, dissecting sparrows, gaining experience, and taking various effective methods in time, and comprehensively promoting them, the effect of one tree blooming and ten thousand trees turning red can be achieved. Last winter, Comrade Gui Jingyuan participated in wheat top dressing in the Guanwan Production Team and worked with carpenters to trial-produce a fertilizer propulsor based on the principle of a wheat strip planter; the result of the on-site test was that it was applied quickly and evenly, and the labor efficiency was increased by 1.5 times compared with manual labor. The commune Party committee and the masses immediately evaluated and finalized the promotion in the field, convened a carpenter's on-site meeting, and distributed samples to each team, so that the fertilizer propulsor was quickly promoted throughout the commune, greatly accelerating the progress of fertilization. This played a considerable role in completing the task of wheat winter fertilizer in a timely manner under the circumstances of heavy water conservancy construction tasks and insufficient labor force last winter.

    3. Combination of participating in production in advanced areas and participating in production in backward areas to achieve a comprehensive leap forward. On this issue, there are also two different situations. One is to participate in production in advanced areas, create advanced experiences, and participate in production in backward areas to help backward areas change their backward appearance. One is to only be willing to participate in production in advanced areas and not be willing to go to backward areas to participate in production, mistakenly thinking that the work in backward areas is backward, production is difficult, and lacking a correct attitude towards improving the appearance of backward areas. We should realize that the main reason for backward areas is that the leadership is weak and the masses have not been fully mobilized. Only when leading cadres go deep into production in backward areas, mobilize the masses, and take necessary measures can the backward appearance be fundamentally changed. The Lu-Jia-Wan Production Team of Pi-Dong Brigade has been wearing the hat of "old backward" for several years. This spring, the brigade captain Zhang Huitang went to this team and ate, lived, and worked with the commune members. After a period of time, he found that the production team branch secretary and captain were weak in ability, and the statistician Zhang Wei-Xuan was a landlord class element who usurped the leadership of the production team and used the clan relationship of the Zhang, Wang, and Tian surnames to provoke dissension, causing disharmony among the commune members, so production was backward. After finding the root cause, Zhang Huitang first mobilized the masses to fight against the illegal behavior of the landlord Zhang Wei-Xuan, exposing his conspiracy to provoke, and removing the statistician from his post. Then, the Party branch and the team committee were rectified, and some outstanding Party members with high awareness and great enthusiasm and the activists of poor and lower-middle peasants were selected to the team's leading positions. At the same time, he helped to formulate production plans and arrange life, so that the leading core was formed, the commune members were united, the labor enthusiasm was high, and the whole team's appearance was completely new and leaping into an advanced position. This fully proves that leading cadres should not only participate in production in advanced areas and strengthen the work in advanced areas, but also more importantly participate in production in backward areas and strengthen the specific leadership in backward areas.

    The current situation in the countryside is very good, and it is a situation of continuous leap forward. The new situation requires our leadership work to be more specific, more detailed, more practical, and more comprehensive. Therefore, we must follow the spirit of Marxist-Leninist continuous revolution theory, continuously improve the leadership methods and leadership style, improve the leadership level, and ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

    坚持深入生产深入群众的领导方法
    从淠东人民公社小麦连年增产谈干部参加生产领导生产
    中共安徽省六安地委第一书记　杜维佑
    干部参加生产领导生产好处大
    安徽省六安县淠东人民公社，从1958年以来，连年获得全省大面积小麦丰产红旗。全社从1953年九点六亩小麦丰产田开始，到1958年丰产田面积扩大到二千二百亩，1959年扩大到二千九百亩，今年又扩大到三万四千八百亩；今年单位面积产量比1953年增加了一点三倍，这不仅是大跃进，而且是特大的跃进。获得上述成绩的基本原因除了认真贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，充分发挥了人民公社的无比优越性而外，也是同淠东人民公社的干部脚踏实地改进作风，参加生产，领导生产，深入群众，依靠群众分不开的。
    淠东人民公社干部从1953年就开始种小麦丰产田，参加生产，领导生产，特别是在1957年党中央发出干部种试验田的指示以后，干部参加生产，领导生产，更形成了制度。当时规定乡社干部，每十天要有五天至七天参加生产；乡社干部下去检查生产带工具，生产队干部到乡社开会背粪筐等；1958年又相继建立了考勤制，半日制，一直到现在的“二五制”。公社党委书记，大队总支书记，除到上面开会外，有60％到70％的时间参加生产。生产队支部书记除到上面开会学习外，几乎用全部时间参加生产。党委书记带头，干部参加生产，已经变成全社的风尚。从党委到各个部门，从领导到技术员、会计员，人人热爱劳动，个个参加生产。公社、大队除留少数财务会计人员在办公室坚持必须的工作外，每个干部都落实到队，以队为家，参加生产，领导生产，逐渐成为生产的内行。例如公社的妇联主任、生产队的妇女队长等妇女干部，过去，只会做一些轻微的简单的农活，而现在经过几年的生产锻炼，小麦生产也成了她们的“红门”，深耕整地、选种播种，样样都会。
    深入细致地总结群众的生产经验
    几年来的实践表明：干部参加生产就能保持不断革命精神，深入细致地总结群众的生产经验，革新农业科学技术，提高农业生产。淠东人民公社的小麦生产技术不是墨守成规，无论在深耕整地、选种播种、施肥灌溉、防倒防病虫等方面，随着生产的发展，不断地革新技术，创造了一套比较完整的经验。例如在施肥方面：由分层集中施基肥，少吃多餐施追肥，到勤查四看巧追肥，今年又总结为四配合（即氮磷钾配合，有机肥与无机肥配合，水肥与干肥配合，粗肥与细肥配合）、三结合（即施肥结合灌溉，结合防冻，结合改良土壤）的方法，达到合理施肥，一肥多能。他们所以能创造这些新经验，正是参加生产领导生产的结果。他们首先当群众的学生，拜群众为师，向群众学习，然后经过苦心钻研，又当群众的先生，从群众的老经验中又创造出新经验来。1957年秋种，淠东大队党总支书记桂景元同志，在营湾生产队参加秋种，发现群众中有“小麦施足座垱粪，来年定然好收成”的经验，并且有一个老农说：“小麦是胎里富的东西，麦籽下地，最好有垫的，有盖的，有吃的，有喝的。”桂景元同志就采纳了群众的这些经验，提出在播种前沿着播幅浇水粪，做垫沟肥；播种后用灰粪细塘泥做盖种肥，这样就使小麦施足了基肥。但是有些干部产生了错觉，以为肥料施得越多越好。管庙生产队支部书记梁训忠种了一亩小麦试验田，播种后，紧连追了四次肥，老农看了提意见说：“肥料不能猛然追得过多，不能一口吃个胖娃娃，要分期追。”1958年夏收时，干部就将群众的这些经验总结为“分层集中施基肥，少吃多餐施追肥”。1958年秋种，公社党委全面推广了这个经验，并在推广中，又吸取了群众的意见，使这一经验得到了不断的发展提高。在小麦冬季管理中，有一次公社干部领导社员在一类苗的麦田中追施人畜粪，当时有的老农就建议：“这种麦苗已经很娇嫩，再施人畜粪，会发生疯长，遭受冻害，应当压一些锅墙土、草木灰。”公社干部接受了这个意见，施了一次压肥。公社党委就这样在推广中把群众的意见都集中起来，提出了看苗、看天、看土、看季节的四看施肥方法。在今年小麦生产中，干部又和社员一道，系统地总结了过去几年来小麦施肥经验，才产生了一套比较完整的“四配合”、“三结合”科学的施肥方法。淠东人民公社干部从不断地发现和吸取群众的生产经验中，体会到农业生产技术的改进是永无止境的，增产是永无到顶的，从而不断地克服了各个时期的右倾保守思想，以不断革命精神，经常地把群众中一点一滴的经验，总结起来，上升为科学的理论，不断地将农业科学技术推向新的水平，实现了农业生产持续跃进。这一事实生动地证明：干部参加生产，就能更好地遵照毛主席指示的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法，就能经常地克服干部中的保守思想，以不断革命的精神，领导生产。
    正确全面地贯彻农业八字宪法
    干部参加生产，就能以自己的模范行动带动广大社员，因地制宜，心中有数地正确地全面地贯彻农业八字宪法，深入具体领导农业生产。淠东人民公社干部有这样一条体会，技术措施不懂，自己先学，群众思想不通，自己先做。他们在最近几年的小麦生产中，从种到收，每个环节，都以身作则地执行八字宪法，做到字字扣紧，一字不放，一个关口又一个关口地攻打过去，直到最后胜利。1959年为了保证秋种质量，公社党委根据几年来的经验，提出深耕八寸，三肥（垫沟肥、拌种肥、盖种肥）下种，寸寸有籽（播幅内麦种均匀）的标准。开始时有些社员缺乏信心说：“要达到这样高的标准，除非七仙女下凡。”公社党委就决心先做出样子给社员看。从公社党委书记到生产队支部书记各级干部的试验田、指挥田，都按照标准的要求，精耕细作，丝毫不打折扣。广大社员从干部的模范行动中，得到了鼓舞和教育，从而口通、心通、手通，千方百计提高秋种质量，为今年小麦大幅度增产奠定了坚实的基础。
    农业八字宪法，是农业增产的普遍真理，在贯彻中必须和具体情况相结合，在一个地区，一个田块，一种作物上，究竟怎样具体贯彻，就要深入实际，深入群众，和群众一道，同商量，同执行，同负责。淠东人民公社的小麦生产，所以连年获得增产，重要关键之一，在于找到了适合当地条件的密植规格，同时解决了与密植相联系的各项增产措施。而这种合理的密植规格，也是干部从长期参加生产中得出来的。在1958年秋天以前，密植问题尚未获得解决，当时有些干部和群众，对于小麦密植程度，有两种意见。一种意见认为越密越好，主张无限制地增加播种量；一种意见认为越稀越好，主张退回到以往稀植的老路。当时公社党委一方面总结了过去几年来自己试验田小麦密植的经验，一方面和社员一道，参加秋种准备，在休息时间，发动社员讨论小麦究竟播种量多少，行距播幅多宽，才算合理密植等问题。社员对于密植这个重大的增产措施是非常关心的，边干活，边争论，真是各抒所见，畅所欲言，有些老农，虽然劳动得汗流浃背，但却争论得面红耳赤，不肯罢休。公社党委根据自己小麦试验田的直接经验，和多数群众的正确意见，否定了越密越好和越稀越好的两种偏向，提出了一个适当的密植标准，并因土、因种、因时等不同情况，分别提出不同的密植规格，这样就把密植规格建立在切实可靠的基础上，防止了千篇一律的倾向，因而，在较大的程度上，发挥了密植的增产效能。
    及时地发现和解决生产中和群众中发生的新问题
    干部参加生产，对于生产中的一些问题，能够看得透，抓得起，发现早，解决快。今年小麦返青时，淠东大队一千多亩小麦丰产田生长异常良好，展眼望去一片葱绿，检查组几次田头检查，认为不须再追肥料。后来，大队党总支书记桂景元同志参加这一片的清沟锄草工作，经过一整天的劳动，发现大面积麦苗中，有一些麦苗叶色呈现淡绿，有掉队的趋势，当即采取逐棵检查，逐棵插标，见标施肥，施后拔标的办法，施了插花肥，保证了大面积麦苗均匀生长。这一事实生动证明，干部参加生产，就能够改变若明若暗，雾里看花的情况，及时地发现和解决生产中的问题。社员反映：“我们公社生产上的问题，是过不了夜的。”
    干部参加生产，可以随时了解群众的情况，及时解决群众生活上的困难，进一步密切了党群关系。我们农村干部虽然都是来自劳动人民，和劳动群众有着天然的密切联系。但是当了干部以后，如果长期不参加生产，就会和群众日渐疏远，造成脱离群众的危险。干部和社员一道生产，同来同去，有说有笑，就可以进一步树立为人民服务的观点。淠东人民公社许多干部在生产中和社员交了知心朋友，心心相印、脉搏相通。“知心话告诉知心人”，社员对干部知无不言，干部对社员体贴入微，结成了亲密无间的鱼水关系，造成了一种心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。施滩大队党总支书记章金轩，在今年夏收中和社员一道参加劳动，发现社员潘新志沉默寡言，似乎有什么心思的样子。章金轩同志便和他边干活、边谈心。通过谈心，知道原来是他家的房屋上次被暴风雨刮坏了没有修好，再加上小孩子有病也没有治。章金轩立即帮助他请了一个医生，治好了小孩的病；同时，安排了劳力，帮助他修理好了房屋。潘新志感动地说：“章书记对社员这样贴心，照顾这样周到，真是毛主席的好干部。”
    总之，实践证明，干部参加生产是深入生产第一线的最好形式，是克服官僚主义、主观主义的有效方法，是坚持党的群众路线工作方法的重大原则问题。毛泽东同志一再号召全党干部全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；必须到群众中去，到火热斗争中去，参加斗争，领导斗争。干部参加生产，领导生产，正是贯彻毛泽东思想、坚持党的马克思列宁主义的领导作风和领导方法的一个重要措施。因此，我们必须总结经验，克服缺点，更好地参加生产，领导生产。
    必须认真解决的几个问题
    怎样才能更好地参加生产，领导生产呢？根据淠东人民公社的经验，必须认真解决以下几个问题：
    要有鲜明的目的性
    要有鲜明的目的性，就是要通过参加生产，更好地领导生产。在这个问题上，淠东人民公社在一开始的时候，存在两种情况，一种是目的明确，十分注意通过生产，领导生产，因而干部参加了哪里生产，哪里生产就搞得轰轰烈烈，有声有色；另一种是目的不明确，只知道参加生产，而不知道更重要的是要通过生产更好地领导生产，有的干部把参加生产当做一个单纯任务，仅仅起一个劳动力的作用。只知当战斗员，忘记自己还是指挥员，以为参加了生产就万事大吉，很少考虑全盘工作，对生产的全面情况，往往一问三不知。因此我们要反复地向干部说明参加生产的目的，一面鼓励他们参加生产的积极性，一面启发诱导他们在参加生产中，更好地发挥他们的全面领导作用。
    要树立正确的劳动态度
    参加生产，领导生产，还要有正确的劳动态度，发扬艰苦朴素的优良作风。在劳动态度上也有两种不同的情况，一种是以普通劳动者的态度参加生产，和社员同吃同住同劳动，没有半点特殊，没有半点架子，因而他们参加生产以后，很快就出现三个高潮：干部社员谈心高潮，社员反映情况高潮，生产高潮；一种是放不下架子，以领导自居，一到那里身上还未干出汗来，就指手划脚，发议论，提意见，这也批评，那也指责，并且在生活上表现特殊，在生产上拈轻避重，一会在这里干两手，一会又到那里干三下，社员批评他们是“跑帅”，跟火烧屁股一样坐不下来，像水上浮萍一样扎不下根，这样就不能和群众真正打成一片，不能发现生产中的问题，自然也就不能通过生产领导生产。
    要采取“三结合”的方法
    采取“三结合”的方法，才能更好收到参加生产，领导生产的效果。
    一、手脑结合。干部参加生产，领导生产，就要手脑并用，在生产中多想问题，这样才能透过事物的现象，发现事物的本质，抓住解决生产中的关键。只有动手动脑，边干边看，边听边想，才能对工作上，生产上，以及群众思想上的问题，洞观全局，明察秋毫，善于抓住症结所在，研究切实可行的解决方案，使问题得到迅速解决。公社党委书记郁明禄同志今春在卄埠大队新盛生产队参加麦田管理，发现麦苗呈现黄色，便问支部书记是什么原因，支部书记说：是因为劳力搞水利去了，缺乏劳力管理。当时郁明禄同志心想，这个队参加兴修水利的劳力，并不比别的队多，为什么比别的队麦苗长得差呢，一定另有缘故。于是就把一个个社员排队，对一个个部门占用的劳力算账，排队算账结果，发现在生活福利事业中用人过多，在家男女整、半劳力五十二人，参加农业出勤的只有三十六人，生活福利事业中就占用了十多人；同时发现有些社员对小麦管理有麻痹自满情绪，说：种得好，先天足，不管也有七分收。根据这种情况，一面精简了生活福利组织中的用人；一面对社员加强了小麦管理重要性的教育，提高了社员的认识，大鼓社员干劲，从而这个队及时完成了小麦返青阶段中的锄草追肥工作，促使小麦旺盛生长。
    二、点面结合。毛主席经常告诫我们要善于运用点和面相结合，个别和一般相结合的领导方法，这在干部参加生产中显得特别重要。干部参加生产以后，对点的领导是加强了，但是只有把在重点创造的经验传播出去，才能对全局生产发挥指导作用。通过深入生产，解剖麻雀，取得经验，及时地采取各种有效方法，全面推广，因而收到一树开花万树红的效果。桂景元同志去冬在管湾生产队参加小麦追肥，和木工一道，根据小麦条播器的原理，试制了一种施肥推进器；现场试验结果，施得又快、又匀，比人工工效提高一点五倍。公社党委和群众立即在田头评定，定型推广，召开了木工现场会，队队发了样品，使施肥推进器迅速在全社推广，大大加快了施肥进度。这对在去冬兴修水利任务繁重，劳力不足情况下，及时完成小麦追腊肥任务，起了相当的促进作用。
    三、参加先进地区生产与参加后进地区生产结合，实现全面跃进。在这个问题上，也有两种不同的情况，一种是既参加先进地区生产，创造先进经验，又参加后进地区生产，帮助后进地区，改变落后面貌。一种是只愿参加先进地区生产，不愿到后进地区生产，错误地认为后进地区工作落后，生产艰巨，对改进后进地区面貌缺乏正确态度。我们应该认识到，后进地区主要是由于领导力量薄弱，群众没有充分发动起来的缘故。只有领导干部深入后进地区生产，发动群众，采取必要的措施，才能从根本上改变落后面貌。淠东大队陆家湾生产队，过去戴了几年“老后进”帽子，今年春天，大队长张会堂就到这个队和社员同吃，同住，同劳动，经过一段时间以后，发现生产队支部书记、队长能力薄弱，统计员张为宣是个地主阶级分子，篡夺了生产队领导权，并利用张、王、田三姓的宗族关系，挑拨离间，造成社员不和，因此生产落后。找到了根源以后，张会堂首先发动群众，对地主张为宣的不法行为进行斗争，揭露了他的挑拨阴谋，撤掉了统计员的职务。接着整顿了党支部和队委会，把一些觉悟高，干劲大的优秀党员和贫农、下中农的积极分子，选拔到队的领导岗位，同时帮助制定生产计划，安排生活，从而领导核心形成了，社员团结了，劳动热情高涨了，全队面貌焕然一新，一跃变为先进。这就充分证明了领导干部不仅要参加先进地区生产，加强先进地区工作，而且更重要的是参加后进地区生产，加强后进地区的具体领导。
    目前农村形势很好，是个继续跃进的形势，新的形势要求我们的领导工作，必须做得更具体、更细致、更踏实、更全面，因此我们必须遵循马克思列宁主义不断革命论的精神，不断地改进领导方法和领导作风，提高领导水平，保证生产的持续跃进。
