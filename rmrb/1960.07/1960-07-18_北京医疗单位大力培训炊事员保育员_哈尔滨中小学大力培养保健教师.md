Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Beijing medical units are adopting methods such as door-to-door teaching and centralized training to help street canteens and childcare institutions train newly employed cooks and nursery workers. More than 2,840 medical personnel from hospitals and clinics across the city have been linked to more than 3,500 street canteens and more than 2,800 nurseries and kindergartens. They go to the sites to impart hygiene and childcare knowledge.

Medical personnel widely adopt the method of assigning people, locations, and tasks, using their spare time to work alongside in commune canteens and childcare organizations, and teaching lessons door-to-door. Based on the different levels of cooks and nursery workers and the different characteristics of their work, different methods of education are used. Cooks are generally older and many are illiterate, so they use methods of oral explanation and visual demonstration, carrying microscopes and pictures for practical teaching, explaining that "illness enters through the mouth" as the cause of common diseases of the digestive tract, and explaining the significance of good personal and collective hygiene for everyone's health. In childcare organizations, they explain to nursery workers the knowledge of prevention and treatment of common diseases of the digestive tract and nursing methods, how to check children's mouths during morning physical examinations, observe children's spirits and eyes, and distinguish the common sense of diseases in order to prevent them as early as possible. They also teach and do at the same time, helping the canteen rectify environmental hygiene, install ventilation equipment, whitewash walls, guide cooks in disinfecting tableware, and help the nursery establish a "health record" diary.

While popularizing education through door-to-door lectures, medical personnel assisted various districts in running 33 training classes and childcare schools, adopting methods such as full-time, part-time, non-full-time, and combining short-term and long-term, to conduct centralized training in batches and phases. During the training, each medical unit compiled easy-to-understand handouts based on the level of cooks and nursery workers, and conducted training using a combination of collective lectures and listening, watching, and doing.

After training, the cooks mastered the four requirements of canteen hygiene work (personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, separation of goods and payments, and disinfection of tableware), etc. Nursery workers generally understand daily physical examinations and related knowledge of disease prevention, children's physical exercise, simple treatment, disinfection, isolation, and food nutrition. According to a survey of 41 street childcare organizations in Chongwen District alone, no cases of dysentery have been found among more than 3,700 children to date.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Harbin's primary and secondary schools are carrying out health care work.

With the help of Harbin Medical University and the Municipal Medical College, the Municipal Education Bureau and the Health Bureau have held training classes for health teachers. After eight months of on-the-job study, 155 health teachers have been trained. Now, primary and secondary schools in the city have basically achieved a situation where every school has a health teacher. These health teachers have initially mastered general health knowledge and treatment methods such as physiology and hygiene, school hygiene, and prevention and treatment of common school diseases. This has played a significant role in popularizing health knowledge in schools and improving the health level of teachers and students. For example, the health teacher of Harbin Construction Primary School, over the past year, has given students 13 lectures on personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, eliminating the four pests, preventing trachoma, tuberculosis prevention, gas poisoning, and preventing hepatitis, based on seasonal and climate changes and the incidence of epidemics. This has generally increased students' health knowledge and achieved good results. An Guang Primary School of Daoli People's Commune in Harbin City, due to regular health education for students, students have developed good habits of paying attention to hygiene and cleanliness.

Over the past year, many schools in the city have basically eliminated the occurrence of infectious diseases. Many teachers, due to mastering health care knowledge, have also improved various teaching equipment that does not meet hygiene requirements, such as adjusting desks and chairs, improving lighting equipment, and teaching, labor, and living hygiene equipment. So far, 95% of the classrooms in the city have achieved left-side lighting, allowing students to study, work, and live in a good environment.

　　北京医疗单位大力培训炊事员保育员
　　哈尔滨中小学大力培养保健教师
    新华社16日讯　北京许多医疗单位采取登门教课、集中训练等办法，帮助街道食堂和托儿机构训练新参加工作的炊事员、保育员。全市各医院、门诊部有二千八百四十多名医务人员先后同三千五百多个街道食堂、二千八百多个托儿所、幼儿园挂了钩，他们到现场传授卫生、保育知识。
    医务人员广泛采取定人、定点、定任务的办法，利用业余时间，到公社食堂、托儿组织跟班劳动、登门教课。根据炊事员、保育员不同水平和工作不同的特点，分别用不同办法进行教育。炊事人员中一般年龄大、文盲多，他们采取口头讲、实物看的办法，带着显微镜、图画进行实际教学，讲“病从口入”是消化道常见疾病的病因，说明搞好个人卫生与集体卫生关系着大家健康的意义。在托儿组织，他们给保育员讲解消化道常见疾病的防治知识和护理方法，早晨体格检查时怎样检查孩子的口腔，观察孩子的精神、眼神，辨别疾病的常识，以便及早预防。他们还边讲边做，帮助食堂整顿环境卫生，安装通风设备，粉刷墙壁，指导炊事人员进行食具消毒，并且帮助托儿所建立“健康纪录”日记。
    在登门讲课普及教育的同时，医务人员协助各区举办了三十三所训练班、保育学校，采取脱产、半脱产、不脱产、短期与长期相结合等方式，进行分期分批的集中培训。在培训时，各医疗单位根据炊事员、保育员水平编写了通俗易懂的讲义，以集体讲课和听、看、做三结合的方法，进行培训。
    经过训练炊事员掌握了食堂卫生工作的四项要求（个人卫生、环境卫生、货款分家、食具消毒）等。保育员普遍懂得日常体格检查和有关防病、儿童体格锻炼、简易治疗、消毒、隔离、食品营养等知识。仅据崇文区对四十一个街道托儿组织的调查，在三千七百多名儿童中，至今没有发现一例痢疾。
    据新华社讯　哈尔滨市中小学校开展卫生保健工作。
    市教育局、卫生局在哈尔滨医科大学、市医学院的帮助下，举办了保健教师训练班，经过八个月的在职学习，已培养出一百五十五名保健教师。现在全市中小学基本实现了校校有保健教师。这些保健教师，初步地掌握了生理卫生、学校卫生、学校常见疾病防治等一般的卫生知识和治疗方法。这对在学校中普及卫生知识，提高师生健康水平起了很大作用。如哈尔滨市建设小学校的保健教师，一年来根据季节和气候的变化以及流行病的发病情况，向学生进行了个人卫生、环境卫生、消灭四害、防治砂眼、结核预防、煤气中毒、预防肝炎等十三次讲座，使学生普遍增长了卫生知识，收到了很好的效果。哈尔滨市道里人民公社安广小学，由于经常向学生进行卫生教育，学生们养成了讲卫生爱清洁的良好习惯。
    一年来，全市有很多学校基本杜绝了传染病的发生。许多教师由于掌握了卫生保健常识，还改进了不合乎卫生要求的各种教学设备。如调整授课桌椅，改进了采光设备以及教学、劳动、生活卫生设备等。到目前为止，全市有95％的教室做到了左侧采光，使学生在良好的环境中学习、劳动和生活。
