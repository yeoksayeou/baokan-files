　　With the participation of representatives from broad sections of Chilean society, the National Movement in Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution was established in Santiago.
　　The organization was established on the initiative of the Chilean Workers' United Federation, and it has decided to launch a "Support Cuba Week" starting on the 25th of this month, culminating in a grand mass rally.

　　Meanwhile, the Chilean "Siglo" newspaper published statements from many parliamentarians supporting Cuba. Rafael Tarud, an independent senator, said: "Cuba has launched a heroic struggle to win its economic liberation, and it should be supported by the people of all countries on the continent, who aspire to live with dignity. Aggression against Cuba should be seen as aggression against the people of Latin America." José Isla, a Christian Democratic congressman, said, "I have been to Cuba, and I believe that the Cuban people are fighting to defend their resources, freedom, and sovereignty." Manuel Magallanes, a Radical Party congressman, said, "Cuba has set an example of how a small country can defend its right to manage its wealth with dignity. Cuba's struggle should be supported by the people of all countries, especially our country." Jorge Montes, a Communist congressman, said, "Cuba has set a brilliant example for Latin America and the people of the world who have not yet achieved independence." "Siglo" commented today on the international support for the Cuban Revolution, saying that Cuba is not isolated in its great struggle. The commentary said, "For decades, US imperialism has sown the seeds of storms in the heart of Latin America. The moment is approaching when it will reap the increasingly imminent storm, a political and social storm stirred up by awakened people who control their own historical destiny."
