　　Because the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, have stubbornly obstructed disarmament negotiations for a long time, with no desire to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, the Soviet government announced on June 27 that it would cease participating in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. The governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria also took consistent action to expose the conspiracy of the United States and its accomplices—Britain, France, Canada, and Italy—to deceive the people of all countries with empty talk of disarmament while covering up their activities of arms expansion and war preparation. The Chinese government, in its reply to the Soviet government, expressed its complete support for this solemn step taken by the Soviet government, and also agreed with the Soviet government's proposal to continue disarmament negotiations.
　　Since the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting began in Geneva on March 15 this year, the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals in order to reach an agreement with Western countries on the issue of disarmament, especially the new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward on June 2, which adopted some of the opinions of Western countries. However, the Western countries, headed by the United States, were intentionally entangled at the negotiating table. Not only did they fail to take any steps to promote the conclusion of a disarmament agreement, but they also tried their best to delay the negotiations, attempting to make the meeting endlessly debate the supervision and inspection of disarmament without any disarmament, turning the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee into an institution that could not promote disarmament at all. Under such circumstances, if the Soviet Union continued to participate in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee's debate that did not solve practical problems, it would objectively only confuse world public opinion, making them think that the meeting was really doing something for disarmament, creating illusions. The Soviet government declared that it could not participate in such a thing that deceives the people of all countries.
　　After their criminal activities of obstructing disarmament were exposed, the Western countries, in an attempt to feign innocence, said that they were willing to continue disarmament negotiations, and instead slandered the Soviet Union for undermining disarmament negotiations. How absurd and ridiculous this is! If the Western countries, headed by the United States, really had a shred of sincerity in disarmament, why did they use deceptive tricks such as establishing “supervision” without disarmament to delay negotiations throughout the three-month meeting, causing the meeting to fall into a stalemate? Throughout the entire meeting, the Western countries avoided the substantive issues of disarmament and never expressed their willingness to agree to prohibit and destroy nuclear weapon delivery vehicles, withdraw foreign military bases, and reduce and finally eliminate armed forces and conventional armaments. The representatives of Western countries, especially the representatives of the United States, have been justifying their war preparations and the establishment of military bases in other countries' territories. At the same time, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are intensifying their activities of arms expansion and war preparation. The United States has passed the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and issued mad war cries. The following are some of the facts about their arms expansion, war preparation, and war cries in the recent period:
　　On June 26, U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates announced that the United States was militarily “prepared” for both small-scale and large-scale wars.
　　According to the "Wall Street Journal," the United States has stepped up its "airborne alert," with B-52 aircraft patrolling the Arctic region day and night, every minute, to ensure that they can drop devastating nuclear weapons into the "heartland of the communist countries." On June 28, British Defense Minister Watkinson admitted that Britain also participated in this "airborne alert" flight.
　　The United States has also conducted a series of missile tests. On June 23, two "Polaris" missiles were test-fired, and on June 24 and July 1, "Titan" intercontinental missiles were test-fired twice. On June 28, the U.S. Navy Department announced that U.S. missile submarines would formally test-fire "Polaris" missiles. The U.S. Congress recently decided to increase military spending by $200 million to develop missiles and new weapons. The United States will also conduct underground nuclear tests this month.
　　The United States is also strengthening the aggressive forces of the North Atlantic Group with missile weapons, preparing to deploy three hundred non-fixed "Polaris" missiles in Europe, and planning to supply the North Atlantic Group with missile submarines. France has already established the first "Nike" missile battalion. West Germany has established an atomic rocket base network with more than three hundred nuclear weapon launching devices. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck announced on July 4 that he would supply West Germany with missile weapons.
　　On June 27, U.S. President Eisenhower once again blatantly announced that the United States must maintain a "strong, modernized, and alert" aggressive force and must "courageously accept the risk of taking bold action" against the socialist camp.
　　On June 28, Rockefeller, while advocating for an increase in military spending of $3.5 billion, openly advocated a "first-strike" strategy. According to him, the United States already "has the best conditions" to implement this strategy. The U.S. "Time" magazine, "Stone Weekly," and "Star Evening News" also published three articles simultaneously on May 8 and 9, revealing that the U.S. ruling group is stepping up its planning for this "preemptive" strategy.
　　On June 30, the U.S. Congress passed a military appropriation of up to $40 billion, more than $600 million more than the U.S. government originally requested.
　　The above facts show that the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, will not lay down their butcher knives for the sake of the high profits of the monopoly capital groups, for maintaining their "deterrent force," for planning attacks on socialism, and for suppressing the national democratic movements of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Therefore, no matter how hard we socialist countries strive to achieve disarmament, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, will always try their best to obstruct and undermine it. It is very clear that there are no obstacles to achieving disarmament on the socialist countries' side; all the obstacles come from the aggressive and belligerent imperialist countries, headed by the United States.
　　For more than three months, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, have been playing the conspiracy of arms expansion and war preparation under the cover of endless discussions in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, which is another profound education for all peace-loving people in the world. The ferocious and evil aggressive group, headed by

### 不容美国玩弄空谈裁军的骗局

    不容美国玩弄空谈裁军的骗局
    由于以美国为首的帝国主义国家长时期地固执地阻挠裁军谈判，丝毫没有就裁军问题达成协议的愿望，苏联政府6月27日宣布停止参加十国裁军委员会，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚四国政府也采取了一致的行动，揭发了美国及其同谋者英国、法国、加拿大、意大利等国以裁军的空谈欺骗各国人民，掩护其扩军备战活动的阴谋。对于苏联政府所采取的这一严正步骤，我国政府在致苏联政府的复照中，表示完全支持，并且赞同苏联政府准备继续进行裁军谈判的主张。
    从今年3月15日开始，东西方十国裁军委员会会议在日内瓦举行以来，苏联为同西方国家就裁军问题达成协议，一再提出了具体的建议，尤其是6月2日提出了全面彻底裁军的新建议，这个建议曾经采纳了西方国家的某些意见。可是，以美国为首的西方国家在会议桌上，存心纠缠，不仅没有采取任何步骤来促使达成裁军协定，而且尽力拖延谈判，企图使会议就没有裁军的监督和视察进行无休止的争论，使十国裁军委员会变成一个根本不能促进裁军的机构。在这种情况下，苏联如果继续参加十国裁军委员会不解决实际问题的辩论，客观上只会使世界公众感到迷惑，以为会议真的在为裁军做什么事情，产生幻想。苏联政府声明，它不能参预这种欺骗各国人民的事。
    西方国家在自己阻挠裁军的罪恶活动被揭露以后，竟试图装腔作势，说什么愿意继续裁军谈判，反而诬蔑苏联破坏了裁军谈判。这真是何等的荒诞可笑！如果以美国为首的西方国家真有一分裁军的诚意，为什么在长达三个月的会议期间，它们就一直用建立没有裁军的“监督”这类骗人的把戏来拖延谈判，而使会议陷于僵局呢？在整个会议期间，西方国家避开裁军的实质问题，从来没有表示过准备同意禁止和销毁核武器载运工具、撤出外国军事基地、裁减和最后取消武装部队和常规军备。西方国家的代表，特别是美国的代表，一味为它们的备战活动，为它们在别国领土上建立军事基地作辩解。与此同时，以美国为首的帝国主义国家却在变本加厉地进行着扩军备战活动，美国通过了侵略性的美日军事同盟条约并且发出了疯狂的战争叫嚣。下面就是最近期间，它们扩军备战活动和战争叫嚣的一部分事实：
    6月26日，美国国防部长盖茨宣布，美国对于小规模战争和大规模战争在军事上都已经作好了“准备”。
    据“华尔街日报”报道，美国已加紧实行“空中戒备”，Ｂ—52型飞机，日日夜夜地每一分钟都在北极地带上空巡逻，保证能把毁灭性核武器扔到“共产党国家的心脏地区”。6月28日，英国国防大臣沃金森承认，英国也参加了这种“空中戒备”的飞行。
    美国还进行了一连串的导弹试验。6月23日试射了两枚“北极星”导弹，24日和7月1日又两次试射了“大力神”式的洲际导弹。6月28日，美国的海军部宣布，美国导弹潜水艇，将正式试射“北极星”导弹。美国国会最近又决定增加军费二亿美元，发展导弹和新式武器。这个月里美国还将进行地下核试验。
    美国并且以导弹武器加强北大西洋集团的侵略军队，准备在欧洲设置三百枚不需要固定场所的“北极星”式导弹，计划供应北大西洋集团以导弹潜水艇。法国已经成立了第一个“奈克”导弹营。西德已建立了原子火箭基地网，有了三百多个发射核武器的设备。美国陆军部长布鲁克7月4日宣布将供给西德导弹武器。
    6月27日，美国总统艾森豪威尔又一次露骨地宣布，美国要保持“强大、现代化和戒备”的侵略力量，对于社会主义阵营必须“勇敢地接受采取大胆行动的风险。”
    6月28日，洛克菲勒在鼓吹增加军费三十五亿美元的时候，公然主张“实行先动手”的战略。据他说，美国已经“有最好的条件”来实行这种战略。美国“时代”周刊、“斯通周刊”和“明星晚报”也曾经在5月8日、9日同时发表三篇文章，透露了美国统治集团正在加紧策划这种“先发制人”的战略。
    6月30日美国国会通过了高达四百亿美元的军事拨款，比美国政府原来要求的还多六亿多美元。
    上面这些事实说明，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，为了垄断资本集团的高额利润，为了保持它们的“威慑力量”，策划对社会主义的进攻，对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动的镇压，它们是不会放下屠刀的。因此，不管我们社会主义国家是怎样力争实现裁军，以美国为首的帝国主义国家总是要千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏的。事情很明白，实现裁军，在社会主义国家方面没有任何障碍；所有的障碍，都是来自侵略和好战成性的以美国为首的帝国主义国家。
    三个多月来，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，在十国裁军委员会无休止的讨论的掩护下，玩弄扩军备战阴谋，对于全世界一切爱好和平人民又是一次深刻的教育。以美国为首的穷凶极恶的侵略集团，是不肯接受全面彻底裁军的建议的。全世界爱好和平人民，绝不能对美帝国主义抱有任何不切实际的幻想，绝不能受帝国主义的欺骗。
    中国政府和人民一贯主张普遍裁军，对于苏联和其他社会主义国家有关裁军各项有益的建议，都是积极支持的。1951年以来，中国政府就一再主动裁减自己的军队，中国人民志愿军还主动撤出了朝鲜，并且一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无原子区。我们将继续同苏联和其他社会主义国家一道，为争取普遍裁军进行不懈的努力。我们认为站在保卫世界和平最前线的社会主义各国人民，必须保持高度的警惕，彻底揭露以美国为首的帝国主义国家阻挠裁军的阴谋，动员全世界人民起来坚决反对帝国主义国家的扩军备战活动，打击美帝国主义称霸世界的侵略政策和战争政策，才能迫使他们坐下来进行认真的裁军谈判，有效地保障世界和平。
