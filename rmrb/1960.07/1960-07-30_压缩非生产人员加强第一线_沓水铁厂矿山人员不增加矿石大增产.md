Compress Non-Production Personnel to Strengthen the Front Lines:
Tapshui Iron Factory Mine Increases Ore Production Greatly Without Increasing Personnel

(According to Sichuan Daily) The Tapshui Iron Factory in Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, has been actively tapping labor potential from within the enterprise and strengthening the mine's production front lines by improving labor organization, rationally using manpower, and reducing non-production personnel. Currently, personnel engaged in underground production account for 85.7% of the total number of mine employees. With the increase in labor and improved work efficiency, the average daily ore output has jumped from 175 tons in January to the current 237 tons, which not only meets the needs of the blast furnace but also frequently leaves a surplus of about three days.

Since the beginning of this year, the Tapshui Iron Factory has carried out technical transformations of existing blast furnaces, rapidly increasing the smelting capacity of the blast furnaces, which has greatly increased the demand for ore. This objective situation requires the mine production front line to increase labor while vigorously engaging in technological innovation. Where would the people come from? A few cadres believed that the factory's labor force was already very tight and that they could only ask the higher authorities for personnel. However, most cadres advocated starting with fully tapping the labor potential within the enterprise to strengthen the ore production front line. After studying the matter, the factory Party committee believed that the latter proposal was a revolutionary and positive measure and decided to support it enthusiastically; the former proposal only looked to the countryside and did not understand the relationship between industry and agriculture and the significance of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and this thinking was promptly criticized and overcome. In order to further understand the distribution and use of labor, the factory Party committee conducted a typical investigation in one mining area: the total number of people in the entire mining area was 451, the actual number of people engaged in underground production was 294, accounting for only 65.2% of the total number of employees; 65 people who were picking up ore everywhere and did not have fixed work faces, accounting for 14.4% of the total number of people; 45 people who were responsible for carrying rice and coal due to the scattered mining wells and multiple catering units, accounting for 10%; 15 section chiefs and catering group leaders who should not have been separated from production, accounting for 3.3%; and 20 cooks, accounting for 4.4%.

After a concrete analysis of this survey material, the factory Party committee affirmed that the mine's labor organization was not reasonable enough and had great potential to be tapped; at the same time, it more clearly realized that the statement that "the labor force is already very tight" was unfounded. Next, the factory Party committee mobilized the masses to calculate carefully, presented the workload for everyone to discuss, jointly reviewed and determined the labor force needed for each link, and then carried out overall planning. After carefully calculating and determining the personnel for each type of work, random drawing and transfer were not allowed, and the reasonable use of labor was guaranteed institutionally. Through this adjustment, more than 300 non-production personnel, auxiliary workers, and odd-job workers were compressed, and the mine production front line was strengthened, so that the number of underground production personnel increased from 70.9% of the total number of mine personnel in January to more than 85% now.

Another way for the Tapshui Iron Factory to solve the problem of insufficient underground labor was to organize workers engaged in ground auxiliary production to spend two hours a day going down the mine to participate in production or sorting ore on the ground. As a result, not only can more than 3,000 labor forces be added to underground production in a year, but also ground auxiliary production personnel can better understand the requirements of underground production for their work through underground labor, making the cooperation between the ground and underground closer. The Sixth Mining Area organized ironworkers and carpenters to go down the mine to participate in production. After discovering that the absence of soil baskets for loading cars underground affected the efficiency of loading, they used broken hoes to make iron shovels overnight to help the underground workers solve the key production problem.

### 压缩非生产人员加强第一线  沓水铁厂矿山人员不增加矿石大增产

    压缩非生产人员加强第一线
    沓水铁厂矿山人员不增加矿石大增产
    据四川日报消息　四川省威远县沓水铁厂从改善劳动组织，合理使用人力，压缩非生产人员着手，积极从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力，加强矿山生产第一线。目前，投入井下生产的人员已占到矿山职工总数的85.7％。随着劳动力的增加和工效的提高，矿石平均日产量已由1月份的一百七十五吨，跃增到现在的二百三十七吨，不仅满足了高炉的需要，经常还有三天左右的余粮。
    沓水铁厂今年以来，对现有高炉进行了技术改造，迅速提高了高炉的冶炼能力，对矿石的需要量大大增加。这种客观情况，要求矿山生产第一线在大搞技术革新的同时，增加一部分劳动力。人从哪里来呢？有少数干部认为：现在本厂的劳力已很紧张，只有伸手向上级要人；多数干部却主张从充分挖掘企业内部劳动潜力入手，加强矿石生产第一线。厂党委研究后认为：后一种主张是革命的积极措施，决定予以热情支持；前一种主张是眼睛只向农村看，不了解工农业关系和国民经济以农业为基础的意义，及时批判和克服了这种思想。为了进一步摸清劳动力的分布和使用情况，厂党委在一矿区进行了典型调查：全矿区总人数四百五十一人，实际井下生产人员二百九十四人，仅占职工总人数的65.2％；到处拣矿石和没有固定工作面的六十五人，占总人数的14.4％；由于开采井零乱，伙食单位多，担负挑米、挑炭等工作的四十五人，占10％；不应脱离生产的段长和伙食团长十五人，占3.3％；炊事员二十人，占4.4％。
    对这个调查材料进行具体分析以后，厂党委肯定了矿山的劳动组织还不够合理，大有潜力可挖；同时更加明确地认识到，“劳力已很紧张”的说法是没有根据的。接着，厂党委发动群众算细账，把工作量摆出来交给大家讨论，共同审定各个环节需要的劳动力，然后进行全面规划，经过算细账确定各工种的人员后，即不许乱抽乱调，从制度上保证劳力的合理使用。通过这次调整，共压缩了非生产人员、辅助工和杂工等三百多人，加强了矿山生产第一线，使井下生产人员由1月份占矿山总人数的70.9％，增加到现在的85％以上。
    沓水铁厂解决井下劳力不足问题的另一个办法，是组织从事地面辅助生产的工人，每天抽出两小时下井参加生产或在地面选矿。这样做的结果，不仅一年可以增加三千多个劳动力投入井下生产，而且地面辅助生产人员通过井下劳动，也更加了解到井下生产对自己工作的要求，使井上井下配合更加密切。六矿区组织铁工、木工下井参加生产，发现井下装车没有土箕影响上车效率后，就连夜用烂锄头打铁铲，帮助井下工人解决了生产关键问题。
