　　Investigative Report
　　Zhang Dengkui
    The higher authorities gave me a task: to quickly go to the San Duqiang People's Commune to understand the relationship between the military and the people. I heard that the Eighth Company, which was building a culvert, had disagreements with the commune: first, the housing issue; second, the vegetable issue; and third, the water issue.
    The next day, I rushed to the Eighth Company. Unfortunately, the company commander was not there, so I had to ask the quartermaster first. The quartermaster told me that there were indeed some disagreements with the commune, but they had all been resolved. He said with a smile:
    "The day we arrived here, the villagers heard that the People's Liberation Army was here to build a road, and they vacated their best houses for us to live in. They really vacated a lot of houses. In order to concentrate everyone, the whole company lived on the back street. Who knew that the front street and the middle street had opinions? They said: not living in their houses is looking down on them. So we had to live on all three streets, and that's how the housing disagreements started." The quartermaster took a sip of water and continued: "The vegetable disagreement is not our fault, it should be the responsibility of their commune leader, Lao Li. As soon as the whole company settled in, the instructor made it clear: 'Most of the people living in San Duqiang are ethnic minorities, only allow more work, more propaganda of the Party's policies, and do not accept gifts.' Who knew that Commune Leader Lao Li also did some work for the commune members, he said at the commune members' meeting: 'The People's Liberation Army is building a railway for us and working for us, but they don't eat much vegetables…' After that meeting, the commune members kept sending us high-quality Chinese cabbage and fresh water spinach. One side insisted on sending, and the other side insisted on not accepting. What should we do? The instructor came up with an idea: accept as much as they send, and after the commune members leave, we will weigh the vegetables, convert them into money, and buy tools to send to the commune."
    "This can't be considered a disagreement. What's the matter with the water issue?" I asked again.
    "It's not about water, it's about changing the waterway. The commune has a canal built on the hillside. The roadbed is being built above the canal, and as soon as we start working, the soil will roll down and block the canal. Once blocked, five or six hundred mu of paddy fields downstream will have no water to drink. Originally, we studied changing the course of the canal, but it would not be completed without three thousand workers. In order to support the People's Commune with practical actions, the comrades decided not to change the waterway, but to cover the canal with a layer of square wood to solve the problem. Who knew that before we contacted the commune, Commune Leader Lao Li had already mobilized more than three hundred young men and women to change the waterway in order to support the early completion of the railway and not delay the road construction. Fortunately, we discovered it early and did not cause a waste of manpower. The instructor and the commune leader exchanged views, and after both sides decided, more than three hundred young men and women worked together with us and fought hard for a morning to cover the canal. Since then, there have been no more disagreements."
    I also conducted an investigation among the masses and confirmed that this was indeed the case. As a result, my task became much easier, and I wrote an investigation report to the higher authorities, which is the above.

　　调查记
　　张登魁
    上级交给了我一项任务，赶快到三堵墙人民公社了解一下军民关系。听说：修涵洞的八连和公社闹了意见：一是住房问题，二是吃菜问题，三是用水问题。
    第二天我赶到八连。不巧，连首长不在，我只好先问司务长。司务长告诉我，确实和公社闹了一些意见，不过都解决了。他笑呵呵地说：
    “我们刚到这里的那天，老乡们听说是解放军来修路来了，他们把最好的房子腾出来给我们住。房子可真腾出来不少，我们为了集中起见，全连就住在后街了。哪知道前街和中街有了意见。他们说：不住他们的房子，是瞧不起他们。那只好三条街都住了，这就是住房闹的意见。”司务长呷了口水，又接着说：“吃菜闹意见这不怨咱们，应由他们的社长老李负责。全连刚一住下，指导员就把话说在头前了：‘三堵墙住的多数都是少数民族，只准多干活，多宣传党的政策，不准接受礼物。’哪知道社长老李也给社员们做了文章，他在社员大会上说：‘解放军为咱们修铁路，又为咱们干活，可是吃的青菜不多……’，经那次会议后，社员们把上等的大白菜、鲜灵灵的水菠菜一个劲地往我们这里送。一方坚决要送，一方坚决不收。这怎么办呢？指导员想了个点子，送多少收多少，等社员走了以后我们再把菜秤好折成钱，买成工具送给社里。”
    “这不能算闹意见。用水问题是怎么回事呢？”我又问。
    “不是用水，是改水道的问题。公社有一条水渠修在傍山上，路基在水渠上面施工，一干活土块就往下滚，不大会就把水渠堵死了。一堵死，下游五六百亩的稻田就没有水喝。原先研究把水渠改一下道，可是没有三千个工是完不成的。同志们为了用实际行动支援人民公社，决定不改水道，在水渠上面盖上一层方木就解决了问题。谁知道还没有跟公社联系呢，社长老李已经动员了三百多男女青年，为了支援铁路早日建成，为了不耽误修路，去改水渠了。幸好被我们发现得早，没有造成人力浪费。指导员和社长又交换了意见，经双方决定后，三百多名男女青年，和我们一起同心合力，奋战了一个上午，就把水渠盖好了。从那以后再也没有闹过什么意见。”
    我又到群众中进行了调查，证实事情确实是这样。这一来，我的任务可就轻松了，提笔给上级写篇调查报告，就是上面这些。
