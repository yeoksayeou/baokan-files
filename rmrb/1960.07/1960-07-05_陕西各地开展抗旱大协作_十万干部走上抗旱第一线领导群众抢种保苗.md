Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The rural areas of Shaanxi Province have launched a massive campaign to fight drought and rush to plant crops, as well as to manage cotton and autumn fields.

Since May, there has been no significant rainfall in southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area, and varying degrees of drought have appeared in various places.

As soon as the drought emerged, people's communes everywhere, under the leadership of local Party organizations, launched a campaign to fight drought, sow seeds, and protect seedlings as soon as the summer harvest was basically completed. In Hanzhong Prefecture alone, nearly one million people are dispatched daily to fight drought and rush to plant crops. They adopt methods such as storing, diverting, pumping, digging, blocking, conserving, and intercepting water to organize the return of water to the fields. More than 100,000 cadres who were invested in the front lines of the summer harvest throughout the province have transferred to the front lines of drought resistance after the summer harvest was basically completed. They eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, participate in drought resistance, and solve problems in drought resistance, which greatly encouraged the masses' determination to fight drought.

Yin Ruping, First Secretary of the Shiquan County Party Committee, went to Chihe Commune to help the masses divert river water to both banks, solving the problem of irrigation water for more than 1,000 mu of rice fields. Chen Changqian, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Pingliang Management Area of Hanyin Commune, discovered in the production labor of the fourth team of the Xinhe Production Team that some people looked down on small infiltration pits and did not use them. He and the cadres of the team scooped water out of several infiltration pits, using that water to irrigate one mu of land. This incident deeply moved the masses, and a climax of "blocking when seeing water, digging when encountering pools, diverting when possible, and lifting when diversion is not possible" was immediately launched in the entire management area.

People's communes everywhere have launched large-scale cooperation to fight drought with collective strength. People's communes in Hanzhong Prefecture and Chang'an, Zhouzhi, Xingping, and other counties implement unified leadership, unified arrangements, and unified water use. Based on the principles of equivalent exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, they uniformly use labor and animal power, and uniformly mobilize drought resistance tools, which greatly promotes drought resistance, summer planting, and autumn field management. Xingping County communes return water to the upstream areas when it had flowed downstream, adopting the method of irrigating land on the plateaus with water from wells downstream and concentrating canal water. In one day, more than 18,000 mu of land were irrigated. In Sanyuan County, all 802 waterwheels in Yunyang Commune were rotating, each waterwheel completing the task of irrigating 20 mu of land. The first ten mu of land are irrigated before planting, and the last ten mu of land are planted before irrigation, avoiding waiting for water to plant and speeding up the planting speed. Their experience has now been promoted throughout the well-irrigated areas of the county. People's communes in Weinan County have universally promoted the method of small furrow shallow irrigation of cotton fields, followed by timely shallow hoeing and fine hoeing to loosen the soil and conserve moisture, so that more than 76% of the county's cotton fields have reached the requirements of no weeds and no crusting.

At present, the drought situation in the Guanzhong and other regions continues to develop. To this end, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to start from the worst-case scenario and strive for the best results. Leading cadres at all levels must continue to strengthen the front lines of drought resistance, take drought resistance, sowing, and drought resistance seedling protection as the center, comprehensively arrange various tasks, and lead the masses to deeply carry out the drought resistance struggle. Before the end of June, in addition to buckwheat, all summer-sown crops are required to be planted well; in order to ensure the completion of the province's sowing plan without missing the farming season, all localities can adjust the area of various crops according to local conditions, and plant whatever is suitable. All waterwheels and water conservancy facilities in the province must be fully utilized to launch a climax of rush irrigation. The land that has been sown must continue to be thoroughly checked, replenishing water where there is a shortage, replenishing seeds where there is a shortage, and replenishing fertilizer where there is a shortage, and strive for full and strong seedlings.

### 陕西各地开展抗旱大协作  十万干部走上抗旱第一线领导群众抢种保苗

    陕西各地开展抗旱大协作
    十万干部走上抗旱第一线领导群众抢种保苗
    新华社西安讯　陕西省农村掀起了声势浩大的抗旱抢种和抗旱管理棉田、秋田的斗争。
    从5月到现在，陕南和关中地区没有下过透雨，各地出现了不同程度的旱象。
    旱象一露头，各地人民公社就在当地党组织的领导下，在夏收基本结束时掀起了抗旱播种和抗旱保苗运动。单是汉中专区，目前每天出动的抗旱抢种人力就将近一百万，他们采取蓄、引、抽、挖、堵、节、截等办法，组织万水归田。全省投入夏收第一线的十万多名干部，在夏收基本结束后已转到抗旱第一线，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，参加抗旱，解决抗旱中的问题，大大鼓舞了群众的抗旱斗志。
    中共石泉县委第一书记阴汝平到池河公社，帮助群众把河水引上两岸，解决了一千多亩田的插秧水源问题。汉阴公社平梁管理区党总支书记陈昌前在新合生产队第四小队生产劳动中，发现有人瞧不起小浸水坑，不去利用。他就同队里的干部一瓢一瓢地掏，用几个浸水坑的水灌了一亩田。这件事使群众深为感动，全管理区立即掀起了一个“见水就堵，逢潭就挖，能引就引，不能引就提”的抗旱插秧高潮。
    各地人民公社展开大协作，以集体力量同干旱搏斗。汉中专区和长安、盩厔、兴平等县的人民公社，实行统一领导、统一安排、统一用水，根据等价交换互助互利的原则，统一使用劳力、畜力，统一调动抗旱工具，大大促进了抗旱夏播和秋田管理工作。兴平县各公社把原下水让给原上，采取原下井灌，集中渠水浇原上土地的办法，一天就浇地一万八千多亩。三原县云阳公社八百零二辆水车全部转动，每辆水车完成灌二十亩地的任务，前十亩地先灌后种，后十亩地先种后灌，避免了等水播种，加快了播种速度。现在全县井灌区都推广了他们的经验。渭南县各人民公社普遍推行了棉田小畦浅灌，灌后及时浅锄、细锄松土保墒的办法，使全县76％以上的棉田达到了无杂草、无板结的要求。
    目前，关中等地区旱情仍在继续发展。为此，中共陕西省委要求各地从最坏的情况出发，向最好处努力，各级领导干部要继续加强抗旱第一线，以抗旱播种、抗旱保苗为中心，全面安排各项工作，领导群众深入开展抗旱斗争。在6月底以前，除荞麦外，要求把全部夏播作物种完种好；为了确保不违农时地完成全省播种计划，各地可因地制宜调整各类作物面积，宜种什么就种什么。全省的水车和水利设施要全部动用起来，掀起抢灌高潮。已经下种的地要继续展开大检查，缺水补水，缺种补种，缺肥补肥，力争苗全苗壮。（附图片）
