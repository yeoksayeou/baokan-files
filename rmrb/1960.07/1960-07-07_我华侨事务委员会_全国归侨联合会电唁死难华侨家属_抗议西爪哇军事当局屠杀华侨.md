Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The full text of the telegram of condolence from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China to the families of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, victims of the Cimaung Massacre in Indonesia, is as follows: Ambassador Huang Zhen urgently forwards to the families of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang:

We are extremely indignant at the news that overseas Chinese compatriots Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang were brutally shot and killed by Indonesian police on July 3rd. We extend our condolences to the two innocent overseas Chinese compatriots who were sacrificed due to the atrocities committed by the West Java military authorities under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the two victims.

The tragic death of these two female overseas Chinese compatriots occurred at a time when the anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia were intensifying. This is by no means accidental. The West Java military authorities began a larger-scale persecution of overseas Chinese from the end of May. Indonesian anti-Chinese elements even openly declared that in order to force the relocation of overseas Chinese, they would not hesitate to "create bloodshed." Now, they have indeed begun to attack and kill overseas Chinese. This is a tragedy deliberately created by forces in Indonesia that are hostile to China and to friendship between Indonesia and China. This crime of creating bloody tragedy cannot be denied before the world. We cannot but express our deep concern for the safety of the lives of overseas Chinese compatriots who have a profound friendship with the Indonesian people. We express our serious protest against this fascist-style atrocity by the West Java military authorities. The Indonesian government must severely punish the murderers, provide compensation and condolences to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop forced relocation and anti-Chinese activities, and be responsible for repatriating overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods and been displaced due to anti-Chinese activities.

This tragedy created by a handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia will not only fail to achieve their evil purpose of undermining the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, but will instead make the Indonesian people and the vast number of overseas Chinese more clearly recognize their reactionary faces, thereby further consolidating and developing the friendship between the Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The full text of the telegram of condolence from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese to the families of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, victims of the Cimaung Massacre, is as follows: To the Jakarta Chinese Association, forwarding to the families of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang in Cimaung:

The entire nation of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students are outraged at the tragic killing of overseas Chinese compatriots Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang by Indonesian military police!

People know that the occurrence of this tragedy is by no means accidental. This is an evil act deliberately created by the West Java military authorities under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia in order to expand anti-Chinese activities. The West Java military authorities had long declared that in order to force the relocation of overseas Chinese, they would not hesitate to create bloodshed. Their barbaric act of slaughtering unarmed overseas Chinese, even slaughtering pregnant women, has not only aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, but will certainly be despised by the vast majority of Indonesian people. Although those murderers have attempted to destroy evidence and cover up their crimes, their evidence cannot be denied. The Indonesian government has a full responsibility to severely punish the murderers who killed the overseas Chinese, provide compensation to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, protect the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese, stop forced relocation and all other activities that persecute the overseas Chinese, and be responsible for repatriating overseas Chinese who have been persecuted, displaced, and unable to make a living.

We, like you, feel very sad about the tragic killing of Yang and Ye. We send our condolences.

All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Beijing, July 5th

    我华侨事务委员会  全国归侨联合会电唁死难华侨家属
    抗议西爪哇军事当局屠杀华侨
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会给印度尼西亚芝马圩惨案死难侨胞杨木妹、叶金娘家属的唁电，全文如下：黄镇大使急转杨木妹、叶金娘家属：
    侨胞杨木妹、叶金娘在7月3日惨遭印度尼西亚警察枪杀，消息传来，万分愤慨；对于两位由于印度尼西亚有势力集团指使下西爪哇军事当局所犯的暴行而无辜牺牲的侨胞谨致吊唁。对两位被杀害者的家属谨致以深情的慰问。
    两位女侨胞惨死事件，是发生在印度尼西亚有势力集团排华活动变本加厉之际，这绝非偶然。西爪哇军事当局从5月下旬起就开始对华侨作更大规模的迫害。印度尼西亚排华分子甚至公然声称，为了强迫华侨迁移，不惜“制造流血事件”。现在，他们果然开始对华侨下手杀害了。这是印度尼西亚敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力蓄意制造的惨剧。这种制造流血惨案的罪行是无法在世人之前抵赖得了的。我们对于和印度尼西亚人民有挚厚友谊的侨胞的生命安全，不能不表示深切的关注。对于西爪哇军事当局这种法西斯式的暴行，我们表示严重的抗议。印度尼西亚政府必须严惩杀人的凶手，抚恤死难者的家属并予赔偿，立即释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁和排华活动，并负责遣返因排华而丧失生计、流离失所的华侨回国。
    印度尼西亚一小撮反动分子所制造的这个惨剧，不仅达不到其破坏中印（尼）两国人民传统友谊的邪恶目的，反而使得印度尼西亚人民和广大华侨更加认清他们的反动面目，从而更进一步巩固和发展印度尼西亚人民和华侨的友谊。

    新华社6日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会给芝马圩惨案受难侨胞杨木妹、叶金娘家属的唁电，全文如下：雅加达中华侨团总会转芝马圩杨木妹、叶金娘家属礼鉴：
    杨木妹、叶金娘两位侨胞惨遭印度尼西亚军警枪杀，举国归侨侨眷和归国华侨学生闻讯，无不愤慨万分！
    人们知道，这个惨案的发生绝非偶然。这是印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军事当局为了扩大反华排华活动而蓄意制造的罪恶勾当。西爪哇军事当局早就扬言说，为了强迫华侨迁移，将不惜制造流血事件。他们屠杀手无寸铁的华侨，甚至屠杀怀孕的妇女，这种野蛮的行为，不但引起了中国人民的愤慨，一定也为印度尼西亚广大人民所不齿。尽管那些杀人的凶手妄图移尸灭迹，但是他们的罪证是抵赖不了的。印度尼西亚政府完全有责任严惩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤被害者的家属，立即释放被捕华侨，保护华侨的正当权利和利益，停止迫迁和其它一切迫害华侨的活动，并负责遣返遭受迫害流离失所、无法谋生的华侨回国。
    对于杨、叶两位侨胞的惨遭杀害，我们同你们一样感到非常悲痛。谨电吊唁。
                  中华全国归国华侨联合会　7月5日北京
