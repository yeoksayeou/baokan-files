Tangshan, Handan, and Chengde Cities Adopt Effective Measures
Deploy Personnel and Resources to Seize Iron and Guarantee Steel Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Hebei Daily, Tangshan, Handan, and Chengde cities in Hebei Province have adopted effective measures to concentrate superior forces and ensure the rapid growth of steel production levels.
    In order to rapidly elevate steel production to a new level and ensure the completion of this year's national plan, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently formed a Steel Guarantee Command, led by two secretaries and one mayor. It incorporated responsible individuals from the Municipal Industrial Production Committee, Transportation Committee, and other relevant departments to tackle critical issues in guaranteeing steel production. While focusing on increasing the supply of raw materials, raising the output of ore, coking coal, and coke, and ensuring that the blast furnaces are well-fed, the Steel Guarantee Command drew over 200 skilled workers from various machinery factories to rush the production of equipment for the technical transformation of blast furnaces and converter hot blast systems for the steel mill. To strengthen internal transportation, the Municipal Committee organized over 200 cadres to assist in the steel industry and decided to transfer a batch of labor from the capital construction front to supplement the steel and coal sectors.
    All factories and mines, based on the spirit of the Municipal Committee, convened consecutive meetings to formulate specific measures on how their departments could fully guarantee steel production. Due to the collaborative efforts of the factories and mines, the qualified rate of pig iron in the city increased by 13% in mid-July compared to early July.
    The Handan City industrial front has comprehensively launched a campaign to guarantee good steel with good iron. Since mid-July, the qualified rate of pig iron in the city has increased by 25% compared to early July, and on the 21st, it further increased by 20% compared to mid-July. The output has also increased, with the daily production level on the 21st and 22nd increasing by more than 10% compared to mid-July.
    Recently, the Handan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened various meetings to examine ideology and leadership, conducted a detailed analysis and study of the production situation of each iron smelting plant, and proposed specific measures of "guaranteeing good iron with good materials" and "guaranteeing good steel with good iron," mobilizing all workers on the metallurgical front to quickly launch a new high tide of producing more and better iron.
    According to the spirit of the Municipal Committee's instructions, the city's metallurgical front immediately took urgent action, carrying out propaganda and education among the workers and masses to improve the quality and output of pig iron. Each iron smelting plant strengthened its quality inspection mechanism and adopted a combination of level-by-level inspection and professional inspection to strictly control the "three gates" (raw materials, testing, and factory exit). In raw material management, advanced experiences such as ore roasting and raw material classification for furnace input were promoted.
    Mining and coking workers also launched a campaign to guarantee good iron with good materials. Iron mines such as Cishan and Kuangshancun promoted measures such as not allowing waste rock to leave the mountain, not loading high-sulfur ore onto trucks, setting up checkpoints at every level, inspecting every truck, and establishing a testing station on the mountain to conduct daily testing, rapidly reducing the sulfur content of the ore. Coking plants strengthened coal blending, coal washing, fire watching, and material loading, and adopted lime water immersion kilns and lime water coal washing, greatly reducing the sulfur content of the coke.
    The Chengde Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an emergency telephone conference, calling on leaders at all levels to immediately go deep into the front line of production, boldly mobilize the masses, boost their morale, fight hard for 160 days, and resolutely complete this year's steel and coal production tasks. After the meeting, Zhao Yimin, the first secretary of the Municipal Committee, Zheng ** Mao, secretary of the Secretariat, and others immediately led a large number of cadres to form working groups, which went to various iron smelting plants and key coal mines to focus on the production of steel raw materials, transportation, and pig iron.

    唐山邯郸承德三市采取有效措施
    调兵遣将夺铁保钢
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：河北省唐山、邯郸、承德三市采取有效措施，集中优势力量、确保钢铁生产水平迅速增长。
    中共唐山市委为了把钢铁生产迅速提到一个新的水平，确保完成今年国家计划，最近由两位书记、一位市长挂帅，吸收市工业生产委员会、交通运输委员会等有关部门负责人参加组成了保钢指挥部，从全市工业战线调集人力、物力、运输力量，围攻保钢中的关键问题。保钢指挥部在大抓原料供应，提高矿石、焦煤、焦炭的产量，保证高炉吃饱吃好的同时，从各机械厂抽出二百多技术工人为钢厂突击赶制化铁炉和转炉热风系统的技术改造设备。为了加强厂内运输，市委组织了二百多名干部到钢铁战线帮助工作，并决定从基本建设战线抽调一批劳动力充实钢铁煤炭战线。
    各厂矿都根据市委这一精神连续召开了会议，制订了本部门如何全力保钢的具体措施。由于各厂矿的协作努力，全市中旬生铁合格率比上旬提高了13％。
    邯郸市工业战线全面地发起了以好铁保好钢的运动。中旬以来，全市生铁合格率比上旬提高25％，21日又比中旬提高20％；产量也有增长，21、22日两天，日产水平比中旬提高10％以上。
    最近，中共邯郸市委连续召开了各种会议，查思想、查领导，对各炼铁厂的生产情况一一进行了分析研究，提出了“以好料保好铁”、“以好铁保好钢”的具体措施，动员冶炼战线全体职工迅速掀起多产铁、产好铁的生产新高潮。
    根据市委指示的精神，全市冶炼战线立即紧急行动起来，向职工群众进行提高生铁质量、产量的宣传教育。各炼铁厂充实了质量检查机构，并采取层层检查和专业检查相结合的办法，把紧“三关”（原料、化验、出厂）。在原料管理上，推行了矿石焙烧、原料分级入炉等先进经验。
    采矿、炼焦等职工也掀起了以好料保好铁的运动。磁山、矿山村等铁矿，推行了废石不下山，高硫矿不装车，关关设卡，车车检查，山上设化验站，一天一化验等措施，迅速降低了矿石含硫量。各炼焦厂加强了配煤、洗煤、看火、装料等工作，采用了石灰水洇窑、石灰水洗煤，大大降低了焦炭的含硫量。
    中共承德市委最近召开紧急电话会议，号召各级领导干部立即深入生产第一线，放手发动群众，大鼓干劲，大战一百六十天，坚决完成今年钢铁煤炭生产任务。会后，市委第一书记赵一民、书记处书记郑?茂等立即率领大批干部组成工作组，分赴各炼铁厂、各重点煤矿，狠抓钢铁原料、运输和生铁的生产。
