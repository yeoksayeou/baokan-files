    Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Rome: Following the anti-fascist march in Genoa, Italy on June 30th, which forced the neo-fascist party to cancel its national congress there, local people held another large-scale demonstration on the 2nd. The docks and most businesses were empty due to worker strikes, and demonstrators marched in groups through the streets, hanging and posting huge banners: "Eliminate Fascism," "Down with the Tambroni Government," "The Italian Social Movement (i.e., the neo-fascist party) must be dissolved."
    Genoa is also conducting a public fundraising campaign to support injured and arrested protesters.
    Milan, Ferrara, Forlì, Naples, Catanzaro, Turin, and all major cities in the province of Piedmont held demonstrations on the 2nd in support of the anti-fascist struggle of the people of Genoa. In all these demonstrations, people demanded that the neo-fascist party be declared illegal.
    The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party sent a telegram to the Genoa Resistance Committee, warmly congratulating them on the victory against fascism. The telegram stated that Genoa has shown all democratic forces in Italy what path to take in order to achieve a new majority in Italy that is decisively breaking with reactionary forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Rome: The Italian Resistance Movement held a mass meeting in Genoa yesterday, demanding that the Italian neo-fascist party - the "Italian Social Movement" - be banned.
    Dozens of mass rallies also took place simultaneously in various districts of the city of Genoa, demanding a ban on the party.
    The anti-fascist mass meeting in this city was initiated by the National Committee of the Italian Resistance Movement and the Liguria Regional Committee. Participating were delegations of former anti-fascist resistance fighters from the entire Liguria region, as well as delegations of former resistance fighters from thirty-six important Italian cities and many other regions.
