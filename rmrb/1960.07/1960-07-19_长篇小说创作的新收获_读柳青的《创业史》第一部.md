New Gains in Long Novel Creation
　　— Reading Liu Qing’s “History of Entrepreneurship” Part One
　　Li Xifan
　　Liu Qing's new long novel "History of Entrepreneurship" is an excellent work reflecting China's agricultural cooperativization. The ideological and artistic achievements of this work are fully comparable to several excellent long novels since 1958 and represent a new gain in the field of long novel creation.

　　The achievement of "History of Entrepreneurship" lies first and foremost in its profound, broad, and convincing demonstration of the historical destiny of the 500 million peasants and their inevitable path towards collectivized life.

　　From the perspective of the novel's plot, there are no bizarre insertions or tortuous stories. It simply depicts the lives of peasants in a village at the foot of the Zhongnan Mountains in Shaanxi after the land reform, even focusing solely on the consolidation and development of a mutual aid team led by Communist Party member Liang Shengbao, unfolding scenes of a new struggle life that stirred the entire countryside. However, the struggle surrounding this mutual aid team is a microcosm of the national rural cooperativization movement.

　　The life experience of the protagonist Liang Shengbao before liberation becomes a vivid portrayal of the folk saying "Starting a business is difficult," which encapsulates the tearful struggle history of millions of peasants and is quoted at the beginning of the work. Liang Shengbao, who fled famine with his mother in his childhood, was taken in by his stepfather Liang San in Xiabao Village at the foot of the Zhongnan Mountains. He inherited Liang San's hardworking "entrepreneurship," working as a long-term laborer and tenant farmer, with "a hundred times greater ambition to establish a home and career than his stepfather." However, the fruits of his labor still resulted in debt, selling cattle, and giving up land, and in the end, he had to flee to the Zhongnan Mountains to escape conscription. The fate given to him by the cruel life was no better than that of his stepfather, who was bent over by life. The reason why young Liang Shengbao did not consistently repeat Liang San's life path – the path of individual prosperity – was that the liberated New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, led him onto a new, collectivized "entrepreneurial" path. The same "entrepreneurship" can have completely different natures: one is "creating" a capitalist "enterprise" of individual prosperity, and the other is "creating" a socialist enterprise of collective happiness.

　　The "history of entrepreneurship" of the poor peasants in the old society was actually not "entrepreneurship" at all, but a history of hard labor, hunger, and humiliation. Such a tearful history of entrepreneurship has been fully reflected in the experiences of Liang San, the young Liang Shengbao, as well as Ren San and Wang Erzhigang. To take a step back, even if individual peasants succeeded in their entrepreneurship, it would only enrich one family while impoverishing thousands of others. Although such a tearful history was settled during the land reform – the feudal land ownership was deprived, and the reactionary regime built on this economic foundation was smashed – it could not completely eliminate its economic roots, because the redistribution of land in the land reform, while partially satisfying the demands of poor peasants and farm laborers for land and production tools, its nature of liberating the productive forces could not exceed the scope of opening up the road for spontaneous economy. However, Ren Laosi, a poor peasant with little labor and a large family, could not help but have his momentum “deflated” in production due to debts owed to large households. Even Gao Zengfu, a poor peasant with a high degree of class consciousness, although politically in charge and a representative of the township people, his economic "unlucky" fate has not fundamentally changed. It is true that during the land reform, long-term worker Gao Zengfu was indeed allocated six mu of paddy fields. In the spring of 1951, he also bought a calf with a loan from the People's Government for farming livestock. This is how he began his struggle to establish a home and career after his liberation. However, "unexpectedly, after just one year, his wife died suddenly due to difficult labor, knocking him down again." The loan for farming livestock was not repaid at all, and the ox was also sold to bury his wife. He lived a life of half man and half woman with his four-year-old son, Cai Cai... Although Gao Zengfu's "background had injected a special quality into his spirit, enabling him to resist all the blows that fate gave him with gritted teeth and silence," who could see a bright future of establishing a home and a happy life from Gao Zengfu's painful struggle? On this old path of entrepreneurship, one can only see the wealthy middle peasant Guo Shifu and the rich peasant Yao Shijie starting their new entrepreneurial activities again – Guo Shifu's new tile house was being built again, and Yao Shijie "stood on the brick platform, with his strong waist akimbo," showing "a kind of restored power." Guo Zenshan, a new wealthy middle peasant with abundant labor and good land, "a Communist Party member in 1949 who enjoyed the highest prestige in the village," was now driven by wealthy economic conditions to embark on another path. The air of his speech and his smile showed that he had become wealthy and "could no longer understand the feelings of households in difficulty." The craze for getting rich overwhelmed his qualities as a Communist Party member, and he was chasing after Guo Shifu and Yao Shijie... Fierce class struggle and class differentiation began again in places that were not yet fully discernible to the naked eye. Poor peasants with little labor and few draught animals were taking the downhill road of continued poverty. Gao Zengfu's mutual aid group collapsed, while his spineless brother Gao Zengrong was engaging in "mutual aid" with Yao Shijie. The insidious Yao Shijie even let out the word that as long as Gao Zengfu, who had struggled against Yao Shijie, was willing, he could also engage in "mutual aid" with Yao Shijie, and he, Yao Shijie, would never bear grudges. The world where the poor peasants were in power seemed to be able to tremble again at the feet of his rich peasant!

　　Could it be that in the liberated New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, there was still a dead end for the poor peasants? Of course, this was just Yao Shijie's wishful thinking. The path of mutual aid and cooperation opened up broad prospects for the affluent life of the vast number of poor peasants. Liang Shengbao's history of entrepreneurship, although still surrounded by the vast ocean of small-scale individual economy and constantly attacked by spontaneous forces and rich peasants who hated socialism, represented the direction of historical development and had extremely strong vitality. Finally, due to the persistence of Communist Party member Liang Shengbao, relying on the leadership of the Party and the strength of the collective, it overcame all difficulties and set up a banner pointing the way forward for the vast number of peasants. This "poor wretches" mutual aid team, just like Wang Yukun's cooperative, which Chairman Mao praised as "emboldening the poor peasants" and "the direction of 500 million peasants," experienced severe struggles, defended its position, and developed the collective cause – developing the mutual aid team into an agricultural cooperative, creating a new base for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

　　The success of "History of Entrepreneurship" lies in the fact that it reflects the complex aspects of the struggle between these two roads in the agricultural cooperativization movement more deeply and comprehensively than other works. There are new struggles with the old classes that have started again, struggles of new class differentiation, struggles of new and old consciousness, and all these struggles are intertwined in the torrent of the struggle between the two roads.

　　Of course, as a novel, all of the artistic and intellectual power of "History of Entrepreneurship" is concentrated in the creation of rich artistic images. Sharp class struggles, various human sentiments, are also condensed in the artistic images of contradictions and conflicts in real life of different characters and different personalities. The author of "History of Entrepreneurship" is very good at integrating the reflection of complex class struggles in the spirit of the characters and conducting delicate descriptions and analyses, thereby highlighting the different personalities formed by different classes, different strata, and even the same class, the same stratum, only with different experiences. After reading "History of Entrepreneurship," close the book and think about those characters that have left a vivid impression on you; their personalities are very distinct. The ferocious and insidious rich peasant Yao Shijie and the seemingly kind old wealthy middle peasant Guo Shifu, whose mind is filled with the idea of harming others to benefit himself, are very deeply explored by the author in terms of personality and spiritual outlook, and they also have significant differences. Isn't the description of the section selling wheat at Huangbao Fair enough to leave Guo Shifu's personality forever in the reader's impression? The personalities of Wang Erzhigang and Liang San, who are both old peasants with strong conservative ideas, are so significantly different! Wang Erzhigang's stubborn and conservative character traits are vividly reflected through the contradiction between the tragic philosophy of life formed by his tragic life experience and the new social reality, while Liang San's character traits are a portrayal of a small private owner with a heavy spiritual burden. They have common personality traits, but also show distinct individual personalities. Because the author is good at realistically expressing the power of analyzing the spiritual activities of characters from the class struggle with fine carving, even slight differences in the lines of personality cannot escape his artistic knife.

　　Among these characters, the personalities of Liang San and Guo Zenshan are more profoundly typical of the times.

　　Which path is the road to happiness, the socialist collectivization path taken by Liang Shengbao or the capitalist path taken by Guo Shifu? Not everyone is very clear about this. Traditional habits caused a small number of poor peasants to be attached to Guo Shifu's path at the beginning and unconsciously opposed cooperation. Liang San is precisely this kind of person.

　　Liang San, who is now bent over by life, once had a "strong physique" with "abundant energy," inherited his father's legacy that "nothing can be smoothed out in the world," and buried himself in entrepreneurship. However, "two oxen died in succession, and later his wife also died from postpartum fever. He not only could not rent land, but even the three houses that his father and he had built with great difficulty were dismantled and sold for wood and bricks, and he still lived alone in the grass shed left by his grandfather." Liang San, who took in Shengbao and his mother and remarried, also rekindled the hope of entrepreneurship, running to the Zhongnan Mountains to carry rafters, carry planks, carry charcoal, and chop firewood, dreaming of buying cattle, renting land, and planting crops again. However, ten years passed, and "the family business was not established." "Liang San, who was over fifty years old, was bent over, and a fist-sized piece of dead flesh had been pressed against the back of his neck and shoulders... He no longer had the strength to enter the Zhongnan Mountains." However, fourteen-year-old Shengbao had begun to take over his dream of diligent entrepreneurship, and Shengbao's enthusiasm for entrepreneurship was even greater than his. However, the result was still a tragic failure. The matter of establishing a home and career was no longer mentioned in the Liang family until the land reform after liberation made a new arrangement for Liang San's fate, and like a dream, more than ten mu of paddy fields were allocated to him. How much this event, which exceeded the old man's philosophy of life, had shocked his soul! Therefore, the dream of establishing a home and career was revived in his "shriveled body," and it was more realistic and clear than in the past. A courtyard with three houses and east and west wings, warm and thick cotton clothes, and the "pigs, chickens, ducks, horses, cattle, and the noise of children" in the Zhuangjia courtyard – actually the world of wealthy middle peasants or rich peasants – were so attractively attracting Liang San! However, reality shattered his "dream" again. In the old man's view, this time what made him despair was no longer life, but his son Shengbao. This young man, who used to be "so clever," "seemed to have his heart dug out when he planted rented land and established crops, and replaced with a heart devoted to work." "When he heard that Shengbao had joined the Party, the old man suffered a heavy blow and lay on the kang for three days...." From then on, the new waves of class struggle after the land reform also rushed into this once "quiet as a gopher" harmonious family. Liang San, who had always believed in fate and was "calm and convinced," was now furious because his son Shengbao was taking the road of cooperation! Therefore, sharp contradictions unfolded in the daily lives of these two generations. However, Liang San's "kindness as a laborer," "painful memories of being exploited," and "oppressed heart" ultimately made him different from wealthy middle peasants, and also different from Guo Zenshan, who was a Communist Party member but was taking the road of wealthy middle peasants. This made "him know: he was spiritually close to Secretary Wang, the Party branch secretary, and Shengbao." Therefore, under the ideological influence of Shengbao and the education of iron facts, the old man changed. This change was not only reflected in his conviction in the "realistic world" of the superiority of cooperation, which was "displayed before his eyes like the Zhongnan Mountains" – his dream of wearing a brand-new cotton coat, "warm and" and "decent," was not realized by the wealthy middle peasant Liang Shengbao, but by Liang Shengbao, the director of the Lighthouse Cooperative. More importantly, it was reflected in the fact that this "slave of a lifetime of life" now finally carried the air of the master of life."

　　It is true that characters similar to Liang San have also appeared in other works reflecting agricultural cooperativization. However, it should be said that it is an outstanding achievement of "History of Entrepreneurship" that it can truly and profoundly express its typical significance from life and spiritual outlook. The author wrote Liang San's short history in the "Preface," and placed the contradiction between Liang San and Shengbao on the path of cooperation in the first chapter, with "The contradiction and unity in Liang San's old man's grass shed courtyard" as the lead for this "life story" that constitutes the rural socialist revolution. The author's implication is very obvious, and it ends (Part One) with the "unity" of Liang San and Shengbao, starting with the "contradiction" between Liang San and Shengbao. The author attempts to show the distinct contrast in the lives and spirits of the protagonists of the old and new histories of entrepreneurship through the images of these two generations, negating the old and affirming the new. It should be said that Liang San's image convincingly completed this task.

　　However, in "History of Entrepreneurship," the struggle between the two roads is not completely reflected in the conflict between the new and old ideas of Shengbao and Liang San, but more importantly, it is reflected in the sharp contrast between the two typical personalities of Guo Zenshan and Shengbao. Guo Zenshan, a shrewd, capable, and energetic Communist Party member, had a glorious past – "When the waves of land reform surged into the turbulent Xiabao Village, he was once the first important figure in Hama Beach." "His enthusiastic words and bold actions reflected the desire of the poor tenants for land and production conditions." In this way, he became a backbone member in the land reform movement, enjoyed the highest prestige in the village, and has always been in the village's administrative leadership position. However, Guo Zenshan could not withstand the test of life and history. Guo Zenshan, who joined the Communist Party with the aim of overthrowing the landlords, obtaining land, and striving for personal liberation, when the rural revolution has penetrated into the stage of cooperation, like every farmer in Hama Beach, must answer the new question that life has posed to them – which path to take, the capitalist path of individual prosperity or the socialist path of collective prosperity? This is especially a question that Communist Party members must answer immediately. Although the rigid Guo Zenshan understands that "without the Party, he would be left with a tall body that can carry two hundred pounds of strength, and the petty cleverness of a farmer to live a life." Without the Party, the enemy Yao Shijie would urinate on his face! He constantly warns himself: "As long as he and Yao Shijie live in the same administrative village, he will never leave the Party, Yao Shijie and his hatred are unsolvable as long as both of them are alive on Earth." However, Guo Zenshan only has this little bit of spiritual connection with the Party! The strong desire of the wealthy middle peasant to get rich has penetrated his soul and strongly dragged him in a direction away from the Party. It is true that he is sometimes happy to obey the government's policies and decrees. Look at his promotion of the prospects of the first five-year plan to Gaixia, doesn't that full of political enthusiasm also show the consciousness of a Communist Party member? However, as long as it is specific to his own "life," the spontaneous frenzy of capitalism will compete for the position of his Communist Party member's ideology. "1953 was the first year of the country's first five-year plan, but it was the third year of Guo Zenshan's first five-year plan for entrepreneurship. He started from 1951." The goal of his first five-year plan was to catch up with Guo Shifu... All of this, "the unpromising part of the spirit of farmers with thousands of years of history" and the ideology of a Communist Party member cannot but be full of contradictions and struggles in Guo Zenshan's soul. More importantly, the path he wants to take in real life cannot but have sharp conflicts with the path of cooperation led by Liang Shengbao, which guides the peasants to common prosperity. Despite the fact that at the end of the first part, in the work of unified purchase and sale, Guo Zenshan seems to have returned to the Party's position, and due to the victory of Liang Shengbao's mutual aid group, Guo Zenshan also "actively reorganized the mutual aid groups on the bank of Guan Canal to catch up with Liang Shengbao," however, it is already not easy for Guo Zenshan to pull his soul out of the desire to get rich! His personality conflict with Liang Shengbao will become increasingly profound with the development of cooperation. In "History of Entrepreneurship," as well as in many works reflecting agricultural cooperation, Guo Zenshan is a personality with profound realistic significance and typical significance – an artistic image that embodies the duality of the new middle peasant.

　　In "History of Entrepreneurship," the protagonists of the times are, of course, neither Liang San nor Guo Zenshan, but the advanced elements among the peasants, whether it is the poor peasant activist Gao Zengfu with strong class feelings, or the forthright You Wan, the beautiful Gaixia, or the growing new type of knowledgeable young peasant Huanxi. Although they also experience severe life struggles or brief ideological distress, it is they who illuminate the path of progress of rural life with a brand-new spiritual outlook. "History of Entrepreneurship" not only provides a group of representatives of spontaneous forces with distinct personalities and typical images of backward peasants, but more outstandingly, it creates such a group of positive hero images that radiate dazzling brilliance. This has played a huge role in embodying the great theme of "History of Entrepreneurship". And at the center of these group portraits is the image of Liang Shengbao, a young Communist Party member who resolutely leads the peasants on the path of cooperation. Liang Shengbao represents the new forces and new ideas in the agricultural cooperation movement. He is simple, full, and permeated with revolutionary romanticism. Although Liang Shengbao is still living in the early stage of agricultural cooperation, the communist style has taken root and sprouted in this young peasant. It is true that Liang Shengbao also inherited Liang San's dream of working hard all his life to start a business and get rich. However, he quickly freed himself from the heavy burden of inheriting the past. The painful old history of entrepreneurship did not cause him any serious spiritual burden. On the contrary, it was a good life tempering for him. He squeezed out his own blood and sweat and tasted the cruel lessons of this old entrepreneurship. When he threw himself into the cause led by the Party, the Party's education quickly awakened his tenacious, hardworking, kind, and simple qualities as a worker, improved his class consciousness, accepted the advanced ideas of the proletariat, and gloriously became a Communist Party member.

　　The new personality characteristics of Liang Shengbao, who lives in a new soil, have been repeatedly and multi-facetedly highlighted in the author's writing. In order to highlight this glorious personality, the author also made careful arrangements for his appearance. Although "History of Entrepreneurship" has concentrated the focus of the contradiction on Liang Shengbao from the first chapter, Liang Shengbao's official appearance is in Chapter 5. At this time, the madness of getting rich, the rising waves of spontaneous forces, the painful struggle of the poor peasants and farm laborers in the spring famine, and the struggle caused by the active credit situation, enveloped the entire Hama Beach. In such a very difficult and smoky atmosphere, the author prominently portrays the personality of this socialist newcomer Liang Shengbao through the chapters of buying rice seeds and cutting bamboo. His tenacity, unyielding spirit, and selfless proletarian style are blended with the simple, hardworking, and upright qualities he inherited from Liang San. The new characteristics of his shining personality are communicated in the excellent traditional qualities of Chinese peasants, showing that this character is truly a leader who grew up from the rich socialist rural soil and is full of profound typical significance.

　　In short, whether from the ideological level or the artistic achievements of "History of Entrepreneurship", it shows rich original features and is worthy of being the most excellent work reflecting agricultural cooperation in our current literary creation. Those who are familiar with Liu Qing's creation will also specifically feel that the writer Comrade Liu Qing has taken a solid step forward on his creative path.

    长篇小说创作的新收获
　　——读柳青的《创业史》第一部
　　李希凡
    柳青的新作长篇小说《创业史》是反映我国农业合作化的一部优秀的作品。这部作品在思想艺术上的成就，完全可以和1958年以来的几部优秀长篇小说并驾齐驱，是
  目前长篇小说创作方面的新的收获。
      《创业史》的成就，首先在于：深邃地、广阔地、有说服力地展示了五亿农民的历史命运和必然走向集体化的生活方向。
    从小说的情节来看，并没有离奇的穿插，曲折的故事，它只是描写了陕西终南山下一个村子土改后的农民生活，甚至只是围绕着共产党员梁生宝所领导的一个互助组的巩固和发展，展开了那激荡整个农村的新的斗争生活的场景。然而，围绕着这个互助组的斗争，却是全国农村合作化运动的一个缩影。
    小说的主人公梁生宝在解放前的生活遭遇，成了作品开头所引的《创业难》这个概括了千百万农民血泪奋斗史的乡谚的活的写照。由于饥荒随着母亲逃难的幼年的梁生宝，在终南山下的下堡村被继父梁三收留了。他承继了梁三老汉的勤苦“创业”的衣钵，熬长工，作佃户，“创家立业的锐气比他继父大百倍”，而他所得到的劳动果实，却还是拉丁、卖牛、退地，最后只好为了逃丁钻终南山，残酷的生活所给予他的命运，一点也不比被生活压折了腰的继父强多少。年轻的梁生宝所以没有始终如一地重复梁三老汉的生活道路——个人发家致富的道路，那是由于解放了的新中国，在共产党的领导下，把他引上了新的集体化的“创业”的道路。同是一个“创业”，可以有着截然不同的性质：一个是“创”个人发家致富的资本主义之“业”，一个是“创”集体幸福的社会主义之业。
    旧社会的贫苦农民的“创业史”，实际上并不是什么“创业”，而是劳苦史、饥饿和耻辱史。这样一部饱含血泪的创业史，在梁三老汉和少年时代的梁生宝以及任三、王二直杠的遭遇里，已经得到了充分的反映。退一步说，即使有个别的农民创业成功了，那也是富了一家，穷了千户。这样一本血泪史，虽然在土地改革中受到了清算，——剥夺了封建的土地所有权，粉碎了建筑在这个经济基础之上的反动政权，却还不能完全杜绝产生它的经济上的根源，因为土地改革的土地再分配，虽然部分地满足了贫雇农土地和生产工具的要求，其解放生产力的性质，并不能超出给自发经济开辟道路的范围。而劳力少人口多的贫农任老四，却不能不由于欠下了大户的债务，使得他在生产上“鼓足了的那股子劲头，一下子撒了气”。即使有很高阶级觉悟的贫农高增福，虽然在政治上是当家作主，成了乡人民代表，但是，经济上的“倒霉”命运，却没有根本改变。不错，土改时，长工高增福，确实分到过六亩稻地，1951年春天，靠了人民政府的耕畜贷款，他还买过一头小牛，就这样开始了他的翻身后的创家立业的奋斗，可是，“没料想刚刚一年，女人因为难产猛的一死，又把他掼倒了。”耕畜贷款分文未还，而耕牛也为了埋葬女人卖掉了。他带着四岁的娃子才才，过着一半男人一半女人的生活……尽管高增福“的出身已经给他精神上，注入了一种特别的素质，使他能够用咬牙的沉默，抵抗命运给他的一切打击”，然而，有谁能够从高增福的痛苦奋战里，看得到创立出家业的幸福生活的远景呢？在这条旧的创业的道路上，只能看到富裕中农郭世富和富农姚士杰，又开始了他们的新的创业活动——郭世富的新瓦房又架梁了，姚士杰“站在砖门台上，双手叉着粗壮的腰”，又“显出一种恢复起来的威势”，劳力多土地好的新富裕中农郭振山，“1949年的老共产党员，在村里享有最高的威望”，可是，现在富裕的经济条件却驱使他走上了另一条道路。他说话的神气和他的笑，都表现了他变富了，“不再能体会困难户的心情了”，发家的狂热淹没了他的共产党员的品质，他在追赶着郭世富和姚士杰……激烈的阶级斗争，阶级分化，在肉眼还不能完全觉察的地方又开始了。劳力少耕畜少的贫农，在走着继续贫困的下坡路，高增福的互助组垮台了，而他的没有骨气的哥哥高增荣，却在和姚士杰搞“互助”，阴险的姚士杰还放出话来说，只要高增福这个斗争过姚士杰的人愿意，也可以和姚士杰搞“互助”，他姚士杰绝不记仇。贫农当权的天下，似乎又可以在他富农的脚下发抖了！
    难道在解放了的新中国，在共产党的领导下，出现在贫农面前的，还有死亡的绝路吗？这当然只是姚士杰的妄想。互助合作的道路，给广大贫苦农民的富裕生活开辟了广阔的前途。梁生宝互助组的创业史，尽管还是在小农个体经济汪洋大海的包围下，遭受着自发势力和与社会主义为仇的富农的不断的袭击，可是他代表着历史的发展方向，生命力极强。它终于由于共产党员梁生宝的坚持，依靠了党的领导，依靠了集体的力量，战胜了一切困难，为广大农民树立了前进方向的标帜。这个“穷棒子”互助组，正像毛主席所称道的那个“给贫农壮了胆”的“五亿农民的方向”的王玉坤的合作社一样，经历了严重的斗争，守住了阵地，发展了集体事业——把互助组发展成了农业合作社，为农业的社会主义改造创立了新的基地。
    《创业史》的成功，就在于它比其他作品更深刻更全面地反映了农业合作化运动中这两条道路斗争的复杂面貌。这里有和旧的阶级又开始了的新的斗争，有新的阶级分化的斗争，有新旧意识的斗争，而这一切斗争，又都交融在两条道路斗争的激流里。
    当然，《创业史》作为一本小说，它的一切艺术力量、思想力量，都是集中体现在丰富的艺术形象的创造上，尖锐的阶级斗争，各色各样的人情风貌，也是凝结在不同人物、不同性格在实生活中的矛盾和冲突的艺术形象里的。《创业史》作者很善于把复杂的阶级斗争在人物精神上的反映，交融起来进行细腻的描绘和剖析，从而突出不同阶级、不同阶层甚至同一阶级、同一阶层只是遭遇不同而形成的不同性格。读过《创业史》，合上书想一想那些给你留下生动印象的人物，个性都是很鲜明的。凶狠而阴险的富农姚士杰和貌似和善脑子里却充满了损人利己念头的老富裕中农郭世富，在性格和精神面貌上，被作者挖掘得非常深刻，而又有着显著的不同，黄堡集卖麦的一节描写，不就足以使郭世富的性格永远留在读者的印象里吗？同是保守观念很浓厚的老农民，王二直杠和梁三老汉的性格，又有多么显著的不同啊！王二直杠顽固、保守的性格特征，通过他的惨痛的身世遭遇所形成的悲剧的人生哲学和新的社会现实的矛盾，得到了生动的反映，而梁三老汉的性格特征，却是一个带着沉重精神负担的小私有者的写照。他们有共同的性格特征，却也表现出鲜明的不同的个性。由于作者善于从阶级斗争中精雕细镌地剖析人物精神活动的现实主义的表现力量，因而那怕是性格纹路上的些微差异，也逃不出他的艺术雕刀。
    在这些人物里，梁三老汉和郭振山的性格，更具有深刻的时代典型意义。
    梁生宝所走的社会主义集体化的道路，和郭世富所走的资本主义道路，究竟哪一条是幸福之路呢？并不是每个人都很清楚的。传统的习惯势力促使一小部分贫农在一开始的时候依恋郭世富道路而不自觉地反对合作化，梁三老汉就正是这种人。
    现在被生活压折了腰的梁三老汉，也曾经有过“蕴藏着充沛的精力”的“强壮的体魄”，继承了他爹“世事铲不平”的遗训，埋头创业，但是，“接连着死了两回牛，后来连媳妇也死于产后风。他不仅租不到地了，就连他爹和他千辛万苦盖起的那三间房，也拆得卖了木料和砖瓦了，自己仍然孤独住在他爷留下的草棚屋里。”收留了生宝母子重新成家的梁三，也曾又燃起了创业的希望，跑终南山扛椽、背板、担炭、砍柴，梦想着重新买牛、租地、种庄稼，但是，十年过去了，“家业没创起来”，“五十多岁的梁三老汉累弯了腰，颈项后面肩背上，被压起拳头大一块死肉疙瘩……再也没有力量进那终南山了”，不过，十四岁的生宝已经开始能接替他勤苦创业的梦想了，而且生宝创业的劲头比他还大得多。然而，结果仍然是惨重的失败。创家立业的事在梁家不再被提起了，直到解放以后土地改革才给梁三老汉的命运做了重新的安排，像梦一样十来亩稻地分到手了。这超出老汉人生哲学的事件，曾经怎样震撼过他的灵魂啊！于是，创家立业的梦想，又在他的“干瘪的身体”里复苏了，而且比之过去现实和明确得多。三间上房东西两厢的三合院，暖暖和和厚实的棉衣裳，“猪、鸡、鸭、马、牛，加上孩子们吵闹”的庄稼院——实际上是富裕中农或者富农的生活世界，是多么诱人地在吸引着梁三老汉啊！然而，现实又粉碎了他的“梦想”，在老汉看来，这一次使他绝望的，不再是生活，而是他的儿子生宝。这个曾经是“那样机灵的小伙子”，“种租地立庄稼时的那个心，好像被什么人挖去了，给他换上一个热中工作的心”，“当听说生宝入了党的时候，老汉受了沉重的打击，在炕上躺了三天……。”从此，土地改革以后新的阶级斗争的风浪，也冲进了这曾经是“土拨鼠一样静悄悄”的和美的家庭，一向相信命运安排“平静而且心服”的梁三老汉，现在为了儿子生宝走合作化的道路，而恼怒得大发脾气了！于是，尖锐的矛盾在这父子两代的日常生活中间展开了。但是，梁三老汉的“劳动者的善良”，“被剥削过的痛苦记忆”，“受过压迫的心灵”，又终究使他不同于富裕中农，也不同于虽然是共产党员却在走着富裕中农道路的郭振山，而使“他知道：他自己在精神上和王书记、党支书、生宝们挨近着哩”，所以在生宝的思想影响和铁的事实的教育下，老汉转变了，这个转变不仅表现在他信服了这“像终南山一般摆在眼前”的合作化优越性的“现实的世界”——他的要穿一套崭新棉衣，“暖暖和和”、“体体面面”的梦想，不是由富裕中农梁生宝实现的，而是由灯塔社主任梁生宝来实现的，更重要的是表现在这个“一辈子生活的奴隶，现在终于带着生活主人的神气了。”
    不错，类似梁三老汉这样的人物，在其他反映农业合作化的作品里也出现过，但是，真正能够深刻地从生活和精神面貌上表现出它的典型意义的，却应该说这是《创业史》的一个杰出的成就。作者把梁三的简史写在《题叙》里，把梁三和生宝在走合作化道路上的矛盾，放在开宗明义第一章，以“梁三老汉草棚院里的矛盾和统一”作为构成农村社会主义革命这部“生活故事”的引线，而且是以梁三与生宝的“矛盾”始，又以梁三与生宝的“统一”（第一部）终，作者的寓意是非常明显的。作者是企图通过这父子两代的形象，表现出新旧创业史的主人公们生活和精神上的鲜明的对照，否定旧的，肯定新的，应该说，梁三老汉的形象有说服力地完成了这一任务。
    不过，在《创业史》里，两条道路的斗争，并不完全反映在生宝和梁三新旧两种思想的性格冲突里，更重要的是反映在郭振山和生宝的两种典型性格的鲜明对照上。精明干练、精力充沛的共产党员郭振山，是有过光荣的过去的——“当土地改革的风浪涌到动荡不安的下堡村的时候，他曾经是蛤蟆滩的第一要人”，“他的热烈的言词和大胆的行动，反映着穷佃户们的渴望土地和生产条件的意志”，就这样，他成了土地改革运动中的骨干分子，享有全村最高的威信，而且一直置身于村的行政领导地位。可是，郭振山经不起生活和历史的考验。抱着推翻地主分得土地争取个人解放的目的参加了共产党的郭振山，当农村革命已经深入到合作化的阶段，像每一个蛤蟆滩的庄稼人一样，必须回答生活向他们提出来的这新的问题——走什么样的道路，是走个人发家致富的资本主义道路，还是走集体富裕的社会主义道路，这尤其是共产党员必须立即回答的问题。刚强的郭振山，虽然懂得，“离开了党，他就重新只剩下一个高大的肉体，能扛二百斤的力气，和一个庄稼人过光景的小聪明”，离开了党，仇人姚士杰会往他脸上撒尿呀！他时刻警告自己：“只要和姚士杰居住在这同一行政村，就永远也甭离开党，姚士杰和他的仇恨，在两人同时都在地球上活着的时候，是解不开的。”但是，郭振山和党也就只有这样一点点精神联系啦！富裕中农发家致富的强烈欲望已经渗透了他的灵魂，强有力地把他拖向背离党的方向上去。不错，他有时也是乐于服从政府的政策法令的。看看他向改霞宣扬第一个五年计划的远景，那种饱满的政治热情，不也表明了一个共产党员的觉悟吗？可是，只要一具体到他自己的“光景”，那资本主义的自发狂就要争夺他的共产党员思想的位置了。“1953年是国家建设的第一个五年计划的头一年，却是郭振山创业的第一个五年计划的第三年。他是从1951年就开始了。”他的第一个五年计划的目标是赶上郭世富……所有这一切，“有几千年历史的庄稼人没出息的那部分精神”和共产党员的思想，就不能不在郭振山的灵魂里充满了矛盾和斗争，更主要的是，他所要走的道路在现实生活中就不能不和梁生宝所代表的党引导农民走向共同富裕的合作化的道路发生尖锐的冲突。尽管第一部的结尾，在统购统销的工作里，郭振山似乎又回到了党的立场上来，而且由于梁生宝互助组的胜利，郭振山也“积极整顿官渠岸的互助组，追赶梁生宝”，然而，郭振山想使自己的灵魂从发家致富的欲望里拔脚出来，却已经是不大容易的事情了！他和梁生宝的性格冲突，将会随着合作化的发展日益深刻化。在《创业史》也是在许多反映农业合作化的作品里，郭振山是一个具有深刻现实意义、典型意义的性格——一个体现了新中农的两重性的艺术形象。
    在《创业史》里成为时代主人公的，当然，既不是梁三老汉，也不是郭振山，而是农民中间的那些先进分子，无论是具有强烈阶级感情的贫农积极分子高增福，还是鲁直的有万，美丽的改霞，正在成长中的新型的有知识的少年农民欢喜，尽管他们也经历着严酷的生活斗争或者短暂的思想苦闷，但是，正是他们以崭新的精神面貌照耀着农村生活前进的道路。《创业史》不仅提供了一组性格鲜明的自发势力的代表人物和落后农民的典型形象，更为出色的，是创造出这样一批焕发着夺目光采的正面英雄形象，这对于体现《创业史》的伟大的主题，显示了巨大的作用。而处于这些人物群像中心的，是那个坚决领导农民走合作化道路的青年共产党员梁生宝的形象。梁生宝代表着农业合作化运动中的新的力量、新的思想。朴实、丰满，渗透着革命浪漫精神。尽管梁生宝还是生活在农业合作化的初期，但是，共产主义的风格，已经在这个青年农民身上生根发芽了。不错，梁生宝也继承过梁三老汉的那种劳碌终生创业发家的梦想，可是，他很快地从因袭的重荷中解脱出来。那痛苦的旧的创业史，没有给他造成什么精神上的严重负担，相反的，这对他是很好的生活磨炼，他挤出了自己的血汗，尝过了这旧的创业的残酷的教训，当他一投身到党所领导的事业中来，党的教育很快就唤醒了他的作为一个劳动者的坚韧、勤劳、善良、朴素的品性，提高了阶级觉悟，接受了无产阶级的先进思想，光荣地成为一个共产党员。
    生活在新的土壤里的梁生宝的新的性格特征，在作者的笔下，得到了反复的多方面的突出描绘。作者为了突出这个光采的性格，对他的出场也做了精心的安排。尽管《创业史》从第一章开始，就把矛盾的焦点，集中到了梁生宝的身上。但是，梁生宝的正式出场，却是在第五章。这时发家的狂热，自发势力的兴风作浪，贫雇农在春荒中的痛苦挣扎，以及由于活跃信贷而引起的斗争，笼罩着整个蛤蟆滩。在这样十分困难和乌烟瘴气的氛围里，作者通过买稻种割竹子的章节，突出地刻划了这个社会主义新人梁生宝的性格。他的坚韧顽强、大公无私的无产阶级风格，是和他从梁三老汉那里继承来的朴实、勤劳、正直的品质水乳交融在一起的。他的光采性格的新的特征，交流在中国农民传统的优良品格里，显示出这个人物真正是从丰厚的社会主义农村土壤里生长出来的领袖，富有深刻的典型意义。
    总之，无论是从《创业史》的思想水平或者是艺术成就来看，它都表现了丰富的独创的特色，不愧是我们当前的文学创作中反映农业合作化的最优秀的作品。而熟悉柳青创作的人，读了《创业史》，也会具体地感触到，作家柳青同志，又在自己的创作道路上迈出了坚实的一步。
