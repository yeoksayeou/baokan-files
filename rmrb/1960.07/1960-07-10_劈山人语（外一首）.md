Words of a Mountain Splitter (and another poem)
　　Sanggan River, oh Sanggan River, I ask you, are you a long rainbow, are you a dragon? Sanggan River, follow me, climb up layer upon layer of mountain peaks. Are you a dragon? There are dragon tamers, leading you into stone caves. (Note) Are you a long rainbow? There is a sky bridge, sending you soaring into the high sky. Though there are thousands of ridges and ten thousand valleys, we erect bridge after bridge to the sky. Though there are layers upon layers of rock walls, we carve out cave after cave. The sun is on my shoulder, the stars are in my embrace.
  Thousands of miles of Sanggan River water,
  How dare you not listen to my command!
      (Note) The mountain-splitting canal opened by the Zhuolu Commune has several large stone caves at its mouth, and the river water is introduced from these stone caves.
    Ode to the Sky-Opening Axe
  The commune comes to build an artificial lake,
  Our hands are the axes that open the sky,
  One hand splits open Yellow Sheep Rock,
  The other hand brings the dew of the Sanggan.
  The Party wields the axe that opens the sky,
  Today people become the masters of nature,
  High mountains bow their heads and the earth offers its treasures,
  River water climbs the mountains and delivers pearls.
  The mountain-splitting canal rivals the Silver River,
  The mountain splitters surpass Pangu,
  Holding the long rainbow as a colorful brush,
  Painting a picture of a paradise on earth.

    劈山人语（外一首）
　　田间桑干河呀我问你，你是长虹你是龙？桑干河呀跟我来，攀上一层层山峰。你是龙？有擒龙人，牵你走入石洞。（注）你是长虹？有天桥，送你登上高空。虽有千岭万壑，架起一座座天桥。虽有岩壁重重，凿开一座座石洞。太阳在我肩上，星星在我怀中。
  千里桑干河水，
  怎敢不听我调动！
      （注）涿鹿公社开的劈山大渠，渠口是几座大的石洞，河水就是从这石洞引进来的。
    颂开天斧
  公社来造人工湖，
  双手就是开天斧，
  一手劈开黄羊石，
  一手提来桑干露。
  开天斧是党来做，
  今日人作自然主，
  高山低头地献宝，
  河水上山送珍珠。
  劈山大渠赛银河，
  劈山之人胜盘古，
  手拿长虹当彩笔，
  绘成人间乐园图。
