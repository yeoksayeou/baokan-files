　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 10th: Disregarding the stern condemnation of the Korean people and the strong protests raised by the Korean and Chinese side at meetings of the Military Armistice Commission, the American aggressors blatantly conducted firing exercises with "Honest John" rockets and atomic simulation bombs on July 9th at the training ground of the U.S. Seventh Division north of Seoul.
    The exercise lasted for one hour, and ten thousand officers and soldiers of the Seventh Division participated. Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, Magruder, U.S. "Ambassador" McConaughy, and "Defense Minister" Lee Jong-chan of the South Korean puppet group of Heo Jeong, personally came to "observe" this criminal act.
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today pointing out that this behavior by the United States not only rudely violates the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also threatens peace in Korea and the Far East, and is a challenge to the Korean people. This exercise further exposes its ferocious face as a vicious enemy of peace.
    The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the military provocations repeatedly carried out by the American aggressors is to further intensify the tense situation in South Korea, and at the same time to suppress the increasingly expanding struggle of the South Korean people with military pressure. However, the American aggressors must know that no deception, suppression, or threat can subdue the South Korean people. No provocative action can save its own sunset fate.
    The commentary said that the Korean people, with the support and solidarity of the powerful socialist camp, will surely use their united power to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of the Korean territory. The commentary demanded that the U.S. imperialists and all their killing weapons immediately get out of South Korea.

　　粗暴违反停战协定　严重威胁亚洲和平
　　美国公然在南朝鲜演习火箭射击
    新华社平壤10日电　美国侵略者不顾朝鲜人民的严正谴责和朝中方面在军事停战委员会会议上提出的强硬抗议，7月9日公然在汉城北面的美军第七师练兵场上进行了“诚实的约翰”火箭和原子模拟弹的射击演习。
    这次演习举行了一小时，参加演习的有第七师的官兵一万人。侵朝军司令马格鲁德、美国“大使”麦康瑙吉和南朝鲜许政傀儡集团的“国防部长官”李钟赞等都亲临“参观”了这一犯罪行动。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论指出：美国这种行为不仅粗暴地违反了朝鲜停战协定，而且也是对朝鲜和远东和平的威胁，是对朝鲜人民的挑战。这次演习更加暴露了它作为一个恶毒的和平的敌人的凶恶面目。
    评论指出：美国侵略者一再进行的军事挑衅行为的目的，是为了进一步加剧南朝鲜的紧张局势，同时也是为了以军事压力来抑制南朝鲜人民日益扩大的斗争。但是，美国侵略者必须知道，任何欺骗、镇压和威胁也不能使南朝鲜人民屈服。任何挑衅性行动也挽救不了它自己的日落西山的命运。
    评论说，朝鲜人民在强大的社会主义阵营的支持和声援下，一定要以自己的团结起来的威力，从朝鲜国土上赶走美帝国主义侵略者。评论要求美帝国主义者连带他们的一切杀人武器立即从南朝鲜滚出去。
