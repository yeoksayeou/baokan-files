Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 19th: After establishing an in-shaft office system in production management, the Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing has recently moved its entire team for political and ideological work and propaganda and education work down the shaft. At the same time, it has strengthened political work in dormitories and canteens, forming a "three-down" system of political work going down the mine shaft, into the workshop, and into the kitchen, thereby making political and ideological work deeper, more meticulous, and more practical.

Recently, after the mine party committee moved the teams for political and ideological work and propaganda and education work, together with the team for production management, down the shaft, leading cadres and party members regularly carried out political and ideological work in the shaft, promptly resolving the ideological problems of workers and problems in production. This greatly boosted the workers' enthusiasm for labor and promoted the development of production. In June, the mine created the highest monthly production record of the year, and two-thirds of the coal mining teams in the mine won the honorary title of Red Flag Work Surface. While working in the shaft, the party branch secretary of the No. 2 Mine found that Section 3301 of the work surface had many electrical chute accidents. He promptly consulted with the electromechanical workers to find a way to repair the electrical chute, which greatly reduced the number of accidents and ensured the progress of coal mining. In May, the No. 1 Mine's Coal Mining Team No. 3 was a Red Flag Team. In June, geological conditions deteriorated, and by the end of the month, production was more than 1,000 tons behind. The branch secretary called a meeting of team cadres to study countermeasures. Some cadres were accustomed to calculating fixed accounts and neglected to calculate flexible accounts. Therefore, after calculating back and forth, there was still no solution. The branch secretary went down to the work face and the workshop to consult with the workers, which resulted in a completely opposite conclusion. The advanced workers knew that they would soon fail to keep the Red Flag this month, and they were greatly motivated. They guaranteed to the Party that they would complete the task! Sure enough, thanks to the joint hard work of cadres and the masses, the daily output increased from more than 100 tons to more than 300 tons, and the task was overfulfilled at the end of the month, ensuring the Red Flag.

In order to better arrange the lives of the masses and strengthen political and ideological work in workshops and kitchens, each mine has a deputy party branch secretary or a mine chief in charge of livelihood, leading relevant cadres to frequently go deep into workshops and kitchens to do political and ideological work. Xiang Shaohua, deputy party branch secretary of the No. 2 Mine, regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, regardless of how far or near the road was, went to the workshops every night to see if the workers were sleeping well and how their health was. If he found someone whose quilt was not tucked in, he would help tuck it in; if there were many mosquitoes, he would light mosquito incense to drive them away.

Some mines have also adjusted the activity time of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists, and have adjusted dormitories so that they can be with the masses during work, rest, and entertainment activities.

### 政治思想工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房　鱼田堡发展井下办公制度

　　政治思想工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房
　　鱼田堡发展井下办公制度
    据新华社重庆19日电　重庆市鱼田堡煤矿在生产管理方面建立井下办公制度以后，最近又把政治思想工作、宣传教育工作一整套班子搬下井去，同时加强了宿舍和食堂的政治工作，形成了政治工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房的“三下”制度，从而把政治思想工作做得更深、更细、更踏实。
    这个矿党委最近将政治思想工作和宣传教育工作的一套班子和生产管理上的一套班子一起搬到井下以后，由于各级领导干部和党团员经常在井下进行政治思想工作，及时解决了职工的思想问题和生产中的问题，大大鼓舞了工人的劳动热情，促进了生产的发展。6月份这个矿创造了今年以来的最高月产纪录，全矿三分之二的采煤组都获得了红旗工作面的光荣称号。二井党总支书记在井下跟班劳动中，发现三三零一工作面下段因为电溜子事故多，就及时和机电工商量，想办法把电溜子检修好，使事故大大减少，保证了采煤的进度。一井采煤三组，5月份是红旗小组，6月份，地质条件变差，快到月底了，产量却差一千多吨，支部书记召集小组干部会议，研究对策。有些干部由于习惯算死账，忽略了算活账。因此算来算去，还是没有办法。支部书记便下到掌子面和工房去同工人商量，结果得出了完全相反的结论。先进工人们知道这个月快保不住红旗了，群情奋发。他们向党保证非完成不可！果然，由于干部和群众共同苦战，由原来日产百多吨提高到三百多吨，月终超额完成任务，保证了红旗。
    为了更好地安排好群众的生活，加强工房和厨房里的政治思想工作，这个矿各井都派有总支副书记或管生活的井长，带领有关干部经常深入工房、厨房，做政治思想工作。二井党总支副书记向绍华，不管晴天或下雨，不管路远路近，他每晚都到各工房看看工人睡得好不好，大家身体如何，发现谁的被子没有盖好，他就帮着盖；蚊子多了，他就点起蚊烟赶蚊子。
    有些矿井还调整了党团员、积极分子的活动时间，并调整宿舍，使他们在工作、休息以及娱乐活动时都能和群众在一起。
