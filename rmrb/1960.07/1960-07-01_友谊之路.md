    Road of Friendship
    Liu Kaichen
    From the coastal lowlands of the Red Sea to the "Roof of Arabia," a highway under construction, the Hodeidah-Sana highway, winds its way through the arid desert, climbs over towering mountains, and rushes towards the vast distance. On this highway line of about 230 kilometers, more than 500 Chinese experts and technicians and more than 8,000 Yemeni workers are working together to build this road. Hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of stones are transported from dozens of kilometers away and poured into dozens of kilometers of desert, preventing it from being "arrogant" again; hundreds of tons of explosives are detonated in the towering mountains, making them obediently lower their heads. Dozens of Yemeni workers, in groups, sing Yemeni work songs rhythmically, challenging the scorching sun together; hundreds of Chinese road-building machines emit a symphony of roaring sounds, breaking the silence of the late night. Such a lively scene has appeared for the first time in the Kingdom of Yemen in West Asia. Residents along the line flocked to the construction sites to watch, praising repeatedly: "Tamam! Tamam!" (Good! Good!)
    These Chinese experts come from all over our motherland. Some have built the Kangzang or Qingzang highways, and some have built the Baoji-Chengdu railway. They brought the enthusiasm and energy from the Great Leap Forward in our motherland to the construction site of this highway in our friendly country of Yemen. They often have to engage in tremendous struggles with various difficulties. In the Tihama region (the coastal lowlands of Yemen), the climate is extremely hot, with temperatures often above 40 degrees Celsius, reaching 49 degrees Celsius in summer, and the ground temperature reaching 60 to 67 degrees Celsius. An egg buried in the sand will have its egg white coagulated after 20 minutes. However, the enthusiasm of the Chinese experts is even greater than this heat. Some bulldozers work about 480 hours a month, pushing about 24,000 cubic meters of earth, fully exerting the effectiveness of the machines. In the Haraz Mountains, which are over 10,000 feet above sea level, with cliffs and precipices everywhere, the Chinese experts climbed these high mountains and used explosives to make it give way. They work in two shifts day and night, without rest on Sundays. Chinese expert group leader, chief engineer, and even medical personnel sometimes participate in the physical labor of road construction, truly full of spirit. A Yemeni friend told me that recently some Yemenis expressed admiration for the optimistic mood and work enthusiasm of the Chinese experts on the highway, but doubted whether they had been injected with a magical medicine in China. I told him with a smile: A "shot" was given, but this "shot" is not a medical injection, but a "Sino-Yemeni friendship" shot. Yes, many Chinese experts have expressed in conversations with me that, for the friendship and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Yemen, they are willing to continue to exert their efforts and carry out this aid project to Yemen, just like building our motherland. These Chinese experts, who arrived in Yemen at the beginning of last year, first wrote the six characters "Long Live Sino-Yemeni Friendship" on the lawn at the station in Bajil (near Hodeidah).
    The growing close friendship between the Chinese and Yemeni people is also specifically reflected in the friendly cooperation between Chinese experts and Yemeni workers throughout the project. At the construction site, thirty Yemeni workers form a group, and three or four groups form a team. The group leader and team leader are also Yemenis. Chinese experts go down to the groups and teams to guide the work and also participate in labor. These Yemeni workers come from many tribes near the route, and are forthright and intelligent. Previously, most of them were engaged in farming and grazing, but now they are collectively building roads. More than 500 of them have become technicians, some are bulldozer drivers, some are machine repair workers, some are surveyors, and some are pneumatic drill workers. Although Chinese experts and Yemeni workers do not speak the same language, sometimes they only use simple Arabic gestures to communicate, but they trust and care for each other in their common labor, bringing them together and establishing deep feelings. When blasting mountains, Chinese experts often first go to the mountainside to lay the foundation, and then let Yemeni workers continue to work, while some Yemeni workers say that they are better at climbing mountains than Chinese experts and rush to go down first. Sometimes, when Chinese experts wade across rivers, some Yemeni workers are busy helping and taking care of them; some Chinese experts were injured in mountain blasting while protecting Yemeni workers, and some Yemeni workers went to the hospital to express their condolences, showing deep concern. Several times when I visited this highway with Chinese experts, even the residents of the villages and towns along the route, whether adults or children, shouted to us in Chinese from afar: "Ni hao! Ni hao!" (Hello! Hello!)
    Due to the friendly relations and close cooperation between Chinese experts and Yemeni workers, the highway project has made rapid progress. At the end of last year, when I visited this highway through the Haraz Mountains, I could only ride mules, donkeys, or even walk, but this year, tens of miles of continuous high mountains have been blasted into a road. This time, I took a car and traveled along this new line, directly from Hodeidah to Sana, and from Sana directly to Hodeidah, smoothly, although some sections are still rugged. Next autumn, the entire line will be paved with asphalt, two cars can pass each other, and it will take about five hours to reach. This will be Yemen's first new type of highway.
    In order to plunder and enslave Yemen, imperialism has painstakingly tried to keep Yemen backward and unwilling for it to be economically independent and progressive. Therefore, they spread rumors and even took measures to try to undermine the progress of this project and to undermine the friendship between the people of China and Yemen. However, all the rumors and slanders of the imperialists are in vain. The friendship between the people of China and Yemen cannot be undermined. This road of friendship will be the best testimony.

    友谊之路
    刘开宸
    从红海的沿岸低地，到“阿拉伯的屋脊”地带，一条正在建筑的荷台达—萨那公路，蜿蜒曲折地穿过干燥的沙漠，爬过巍峨的山岭，奔向辽阔的远方。在这二百三十公里左右的公路线上，五百多名中国专家和技术人员，八千多名也门工人，齐心协力地从事着这条公路的建设，几十万方的石块，从几十公里以外的地方运来，倾泻在几十公里的沙漠地带，使它不敢再“飞扬跋扈”；几百吨的炸药，在崇山峻岭中爆炸，使它乖乖地低下头来。几十人一组的也门工人，有节奏地唱着也门号子，一起向炎日挑战；几百台中国的筑路机器，发出轰鸣的交响曲，打破了深夜的沉寂。这样一种热火朝天的场面，第一次出现在这西亚的也门王国里，沿线的居民，纷纷跑到施工点去观看，连声地称赞说：“太马姆！太马姆！”（好！好！）
    这些中国专家来自我们祖国的四面八方，有的曾修过康藏或青藏公路，有的曾筑过宝成铁路，他们把在祖国大跃进中的热情和干劲，带到了我们友好的国家也门的这条公路的工地上，他们常常要同各种困难展开巨大的搏斗。在蒂哈马地区（也门的沿海低地），气候酷热，温度经常在摄氏四十度以上，夏天则达四十九度，地面温度达六十度到六十七度，鸡蛋埋在沙里，二十分钟以后，蛋白就凝结起来了。但中国专家们的干劲比这种热度还大，有的推土机每月工作四百八十小时左右，推土约二万四千方，充分发挥了机械的效能；在哈拉兹山区，海拔达一万英尺以上，到处是悬崖削壁，中国专家们就爬上这些高山，用炸药叫它让道。他们日夜两班地工作着，星期天也不休息，中国专家组长、总工程师甚至医务人员，有时也参加了筑路的体力劳动，真是意气风发。一位也门朋友告诉我，最近一些也门人对公路上中国专家们的乐观情绪和工作干劲表示钦佩，但怀疑是否他们在中国打了一种富有神效的药剂针。我微笑地告诉他：是打了“针”，但这个“针”不是医药用的针，而是“中也友谊”针。是的，许多中国专家在和我的交谈中，都表示：为了中国和也门两国人民的友谊和友好合作，愿意像建设我们祖国一样，不断地发挥干劲，来进行这项援助也门的工程。去年初到达也门的这些中国专家们，在巴基尔（荷台达附近）的驻地上，就首先用草坪写出了“中也友谊万岁”六个大字。
    日益增长的中国和也门人民的亲密友谊，也具体地表现在中国专家和也门工人在整个工程上的友好合作。在工地上，三十个也门工人组成一个组，三、四个组组成一个队，组长和队长也都是也门人，中国专家下到组队去指导工作，同时也参加劳动。这些也门工人来自沿线附近的许多部落，豪爽而又聪明。以前，他们大都是种田和放牧，现在则集体筑路，其中有五百多人已成为技术工人，有的是推土机司机，有的是修理机器工人，有的是测工，有的是风钻工。中国专家和也门工人，虽然言语不通，有时，只用简单的阿拉伯语比划着手势交谈，但他们在共同的劳动中，相互信任，相互爱护，使他们打成一片，建立了深厚的情感。炸山时，中国专家们常先到山腰打下基础，再让也门工人继续工作，而有些也门工人，则说他们比中国专家还善于爬山，抢着要先下去。有时，中国专家涉水过河时，一些也门工人也忙着来搀扶照顾；个别中国专家，在山区爆破中因掩护也门工人而受伤，一些也门工人就跑到医院去慰问，表示了深切的关怀。我几次随中国专家们访问这条公路时，连沿线的村镇居民，无论是大人和小孩，老远地就用中国话对我们喊：“你好！你好！”
    由于中国专家和也门工人的友好关系和密切合作，公路工程取得了迅速的进展。去年年底，我访问这条公路经过哈拉兹山区时，只能骑骡子、驴子、甚至步行，但今年来，几十里长的连绵高山，已被爆破出一条道路来。这一次，我乘了汽车，沿着这条新线旅行，从荷台达直达萨那，从萨那直达荷台达，畅通无阻，虽然有些地段还崎岖不平。明年秋季，全线将铺上柏油，双车可以相错，约五小时就可到达了。这将是也门第一条新型公路。
    帝国主义为了掠夺也门、奴役也门，它们处心积虑地要保持也门落后，不愿它经济上独立和进步。因之，它们曾散布谣言，甚至采取措施，企图破坏这个工程的进展，并且借以破坏中也两国人民的友谊。然而，帝国主义者的一切造谣和中伤都是枉费心机的。中国和也门两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的。这条友谊之路将是最好的见证。（附图片）
