Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 20th: Chengdu Municipality is taking various measures to cultivate childcare workers and kindergarten teachers for urban people's communes. In April and May alone this year, the city trained more than 2,400 childcare workers and kindergarten teachers, accounting for half of the total number of childcare personnel in the city's urban communes. The main training methods are:

	First, holding short-term training courses to train childcare personnel with skills in education, medical care, health care, and administration. For example, the Dongcheng District Children's Health Clinic has trained 50 health workers to the level of assistant nurses in the past two months.

	Second, carrying out spare-time learning activities. Many communes organize childcare personnel into spare-time study groups by region, with the street party organizations, schools, hospitals, and public kindergartens in the area assigning dedicated personnel to teach, holding regular classes and discussions on a weekly basis. For example, the Wangjiaba Commune organizes childcare personnel into classes according to region and experience level (new and experienced), learning three to four evenings a week from March to the present. The learning content includes both political and professional courses with thematic lectures.

	Third, vigorously developing a professional guidance network, with guidance provided by public or well-established childcare organizations and health organizations, implementing a system of experienced workers leading new workers, publicly-run organizations leading privately-run organizations, and health organizations leading childcare organizations, with each being responsible for a specific area and providing regular guidance. The form of guidance includes “sister kindergartens,” with one older kindergarten leading one new kindergarten to achieve a uniform standard; some implement a "contract system," with older kindergartens contracting new kindergartens, and experienced workers contracting new workers; some adopt a "one-stop" approach, with older kindergartens serving as the leader to drive new kindergartens.

	Fourth, entrusting early childhood normal schools to provide training. The Chengdu Early Childhood Normal School has established a dedicated childcare personnel training class, with more than 90 childcare personnel sent by various kindergartens to study. Because the study period is half a year, the content is relatively systematic, comprehensive, and rich, enabling the cultivation of a group of highly skilled childcare work backbones.

    成都采取短期训练和入校学习等办法
    积极帮助公社培养保教人员
    据新华社成都20日电　成都市采取多种措施为城市人民公社培养保育员和幼儿园师资。仅今年4、5两月，全市培训的保育员和幼儿园师资就有二千四百多人，占全市各城市公社保教人员总数的一半。培训的办法主要有：
    一，举办短期训练班，培训具有教养、医疗护理、保健、行政管理等一方面技能的保育人员，如东城区儿童保健所，就在最近两个月中，培训了五十名达到助理护士水平的保健员。
    二，开展业余学习活动。许多公社把保育人员按地区编成业余学习小组，由所在地的街道党组织、学校、医院、公立幼儿园指定专人担任教学工作，每周按时定点上课和讨论。如王家坝公社保育人员依地区按新手、老手分别编班学习，从3月到现在，每周学习三至四个晚上，学习内容包括政治课、业务课两种专题讲授。
    三，大搞业务辅导网，辅导者由公立的或基础较好的保育组织和保健组织担任，实行老带新、公办带民办、保健组织带保育组织，分片包干，经常辅导。辅导的形式，有的搞“姐妹园”，由一个老园带动一个新园，达到“一个样”；有的实行“包干制”，由老园包新园，老手包新手；有的采取“一条龙”的方法，以老园为龙头，带动新园。
    四，委托幼儿师范学校培养。成都市幼儿师范学校专设了保育人员训练班，各幼儿园派去学习的保育人员有九十多名。由于学习时间是半年，学习的内容比较系统、全面、丰富，能够培养一批水平较高的保育工作骨干。
