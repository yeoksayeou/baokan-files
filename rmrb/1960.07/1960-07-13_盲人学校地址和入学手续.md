　　Addresses and Enrollment Procedures for Schools for the Blind
    Recently, this newspaper received letters from readers Song Jinchi, Shi Bin, Hu Shuyi, and others inquiring about Braille schools and technical schools for the blind. After contacting the relevant authorities, we now reply as follows:
    1. Where are the Braille schools and technical schools for the blind located?
    It is understood that in the Hebei area there are Tianjin School for the Blind, Wuqiao County School for the Blind in Hebei, Yixian Special Education School for Blind, Deaf and Mute Children, and Beijing School for the Blind. These schools are all local and do not accept students from other places. Some regions have also established schools in the form of part-work and part-study, which only accept blind, deaf, and mute people from their own regions. The issue of blind people learning culture and technology in various places can be resolved by contacting the local education or civil affairs departments.
    In recent years, the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute and some local civil affairs departments and local organizations for the blind have held massage technique training classes. Such short-term training classes have been established in Beijing, Baoding, Taiyuan, Changsha, Luoyang, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places. Some rural people's communes have also established factories and production groups for the blind. Currently, there are no institutions that specifically establish technical schools.
    2. What are the enrollment regulations? How to complete the procedures?
    According to the schools that have been established and the units in various places that are engaged in both production and study, some are led by the civil affairs departments, some are led by the education departments, and some are directly under the leadership of the people's communes. The situation is different. Some of the enrollment of students (such as schools for the blind) is on a regular basis, some are organized by local organizations, and some are selected and sent by local civil affairs departments (such as massage training classes). There are no unified regulations. For specific enrollment methods and procedures, please contact the local civil affairs and education departments for resolution.

　　盲人学校地址和入学手续
    最近，本报收到宋金池、时滨、胡述义等读者来信询问有关盲文学校及盲人技术学校等方面的问题。经与主管机关联系后，现答复如下：
    1．哪里有盲文学校和盲人技术学校？
    据了解河北地区有天津市盲童学校、河北吴桥县盲童学校、易县盲聋哑红专学校和北京市盲童学校。这些学校都是地方性的，不吸收外地学员。还有些地区办了半工半读形式的学校，也只是吸收本地区盲聋哑人参加的。各地盲人学习文化和技术的问题，可和本地区教育或民政部门联系解决。
    几年来，中国盲人聋哑人协会和一些地方民政部门、地方盲人组织举办了按摩技术训练班。如在北京、保定、太原、长沙、洛阳、沈阳、旅大等地都设有这种短期训练班，也有一些农村人民公社建立了盲人工厂和生产小组。目前还没有设立专门技术学校的机构。
    2．入学时有些什么规定？怎样办理手续？
    根据目前已建立的学校和各地一面生产一面学习的单位来说，有的是民政部门领导的，有的是教育部门领导的，有的直接属于人民公社领导，情况不一样。吸收学员有的（如盲校）是按期招生的，有的是地方组织起来的，有的是通过地方民政部门选送的（如按摩训练班），没有统一规定。关于入学的具体办法和手续，可与当地民政部门和教育部门联系解决。
