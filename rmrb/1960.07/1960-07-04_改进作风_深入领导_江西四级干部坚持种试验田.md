Improving Work Style and Deepening Leadership
Jiangxi's Four Levels of Cadres Persist in Planting Experimental Plots

    (Report from our newspaper) The broad masses of rural cadres in Jiangxi province persist in cultivating large-scale experimental plots, using these as a foundation to guide overall progress through exemplary models. The practice of cadres at all levels cultivating experimental plots, participating in production, and leading production through experimental plots, as demonstrated in the continuous great leap forward over the past two years, has proven to be an effective working method for improving the work style of cadres and implementing the mass line. It is also a powerful tool for achieving in-depth and specific leadership through a combination of focused and comprehensive approaches. This year, Party committees at all levels have launched an even larger and broader movement to cultivate experimental plots than in the past. From the county to the commune level, secretaries take the lead, and cadres at the county, commune, brigade, and team levels have all established experimental plots. The experimental plots established this year are large in area and wide in scope, focusing on rice while also incorporating coarse grains and cash crops. They include both high-yield and low-yield fields, as well as both cultivated and newly reclaimed land. In addition, "experimental plots" have been established in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Cadres at all levels delve into the front lines of production to cultivate experimental plots, engaging in practical learning, participation, and leadership of production. Wang Liange, the First Secretary of the Anyi County Party Committee, after becoming a field leader in Dinghu Brigade of Dinghu Commune, often went barefoot to work alongside commune members, inspecting and studying crop growth together. The commune members called him "our good field leader." In the past, Leping County believed that cotton could not be grown in mountainous areas, but Wang Jingrong, the County Party Secretary, personally cultivated mountain cotton experimental plots in Gaojia Brigade of Lingang Commune, studying cotton planting techniques with the commune members. They jointly carried out sowing, fertilization, weeding, thinning, and pest control. Now, the cotton seedlings in the more than 100 mu of cotton experimental plots are growing very well, setting a red banner for cotton planting in mountainous areas. Many cadres have also delved into forestry areas, pig farms, fish farms, and fertilizer plants to engage in experimental plots, experimental pens, and experimental farms, aiming to gain experience in all aspects. While engaging in practical cultivation of experimental plots, cadres at all levels also guide and promote general fields through experimental plots. In order to achieve a combination of focused and comprehensive approaches, the general methods adopted in various places are: using experimental plots as a foundation, dividing areas into sections, and organizing on-site meetings, on-site visits, and on-site evaluations. In Jiujiang Prefecture, counties universally set up command posts based on cadres' experimental plots. Centered around the command posts of county and commune secretaries, a command network is formed to discover problems, disseminate experiences, and direct general fields at any time. Since the spring plowing season, communes in Linchuan, Zixi and other counties have held more than 100 "on-site experience exchange meetings" in various experimental fields, focusing on deep plowing, close planting, seedling protection, transformation of low-yield fields, and elimination of third-class seedlings. In Shangyou County, the initial methods for transforming low-yield mountainous fields were piecemeal, failing to fundamentally solve the problem. The County Party Committee researched and created the experience of "equal emphasis on water, fertilizer, and soil, combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry" in low-yield experimental plots to comprehensively transform low-yield fields. This experience was immediately promoted comprehensively, making the transformation of low-yield fields in the county this year solid and meticulous. Zhu Daolin, the First Secretary of the Dasha Commune Party Committee in Duchang County, after eliminating third-class seedlings in the early rice experimental fields, discovered that the leaves of some rice seedlings were softening. After studying with old farmers who were also cultivating experimental plots, he realized that this was a sign of future lodging. Therefore, he took measures to apply superphosphate and potassium phosphate fertilizer early, and the rice seedlings returned to normal. Based on this situation, Zhu Daolin launched a "check rice seedlings and prevent lodging" campaign throughout the commune through on-site meetings attended by representatives from each team, preventing late-stage lodging of rice seedlings early on.

    Cadres cultivating experimental plots, participating in production, and leading production have been universally praised and warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Commune members said, "Where there are cadres' experimental plots, production changes!" They call the cadres' experimental plots "phoenix fields" and "command fields."

    改进作风　深入领导
    江西四级干部坚持种试验田
    本报讯　江西广大农村干部坚持大种试验田，以试验田为基点，通过典型指挥全面。在连续两年大跃进的实践中，证明各级干部大种试验田，通过试验田参加生产领导生产，是改进干部作风，贯彻执行群众路线的有效工作方法；是以点带面，点面结合，实现深入具体领导的有力武器。今年，各级党委掀起了一个比过去规模更大范围更广的大种试验田运动。全省从县到公社，书记带头，县、社、大队、小队四级干部都分别建立了试验田，今年各地建立的试验田面积大，范围广，既以水稻为主，又有些种杂粮和经济作物，既有高产田，又有低产田，既有耕地熟地，又有新垦荒地。此外，林、牧、副、渔各业也都有“试验田”。各级干部深入生产第一线种试验田，做到脚踏实地学习生产、参加生产和领导生产。安义县县委第一书记王连阁在丁湖公社丁湖大队当坂长以后，经常打赤脚与社员一起生产，一起检查、研究作物生长情况，社员称他为“我们的好坂长”。乐平县过去认为山区不能种棉花，县委书记王景荣即亲自到临港公社高家大队种山地棉花试验田，同社员共同研究植棉技术，一块进行播种、施肥、锄草、间苗、治虫，现在一百多亩棉花试验田棉苗生长很好。为山区植棉树立了一面红旗。许多干部还深入林区、养猪场、养鱼场、化肥厂，大搞试验田、试验栏、试验场，做到样样有经验。各级干部在脚踏实地大种试验田的同时，通过试验田，指导带动一般田。各地为了做到以点带面、点面结合，一般采取的办法是：以试验田为基点，分区划片，组织现场会议、现场参观、现场评比。九江专区各县普遍按干部试验田设立指挥点，以县、社书记指挥点为中心，组成指挥网，随时发现问题，传播经验，指挥一般田。临川、资溪等县各公社春耕以来，已在各种试验田里召开深耕、密植、护秧、改造低产田、消灭三类苗等“现场经验交流会”达百次以上。上犹县各地开始改造山区低产田都是“零打碎敲”的办法，不能从根本上解决问题。县委在低产试验田里研究创造出“水肥土三并重，农林牧相结合”综合改造低产田的经验，立即进行全面推广，使今年全县低产田改造工作作得扎实细致。都昌县大沙公社党委第一书记朱道林在早稻试验田消灭三类苗后，发现有些禾苗叶子变软，经同种试验田的老农研究是将来倒伏的象征，于是便采取措施及早追施过磷酸钙和磷钾肥，禾苗才转为正常。根据这个情况，朱道林通过有各队代表参加的现场会，在全社范围内开展了“查禾苗，防倒伏”工作，及早防止禾苗后期倒伏。
    干部种试验田，参加生产领导生产，受到广大群众普遍赞扬和热烈欢迎。社员们说：“哪里有干部试验田，哪里生产就变了样！”称干部的试验田是“凤凰田”“指挥田”。
