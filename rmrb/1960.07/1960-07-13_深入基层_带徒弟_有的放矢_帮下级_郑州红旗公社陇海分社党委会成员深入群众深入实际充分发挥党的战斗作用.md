　　Going Deep into the Grassroots to "Apprentice"; "Tailor-Made" Assistance to Subordinates
　　Zhengzhou Red Flag Commune's Longhai Branch Party Committee Members Go Deep into the Masses and Deep into Reality to Give Full Play to the Party's Combat Role

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Longhai Branch Committee of the Zhengzhou Red Flag People's Commune has formed a set of working methods that penetrate the masses and reality, from organizational leadership to work style, and has excellently played the party's combat role.

    The Longhai Branch has more than 7,000 households and more than 30,000 people, with its own industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, health, and welfare undertakings. The entire branch has seventeen party branches. The Branch Party Committee fully estimated the complexity of urban people's communes in grasping both production and life, and believed that the first thing to do in organizational leadership was to follow the mass line, use the power of all parties, and give themselves millions of eyes among the masses and in various tasks. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the political and ideological education of staff members, they also made specific regulations on the concrete methods for these departments to go deep into reality and into the masses for departments closely related to the production and life of the masses, such as the Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League, commerce, grain, banks, culture, education, and welfare, and required and supported them to engage in various experimental fields. At first, the work of these departments was passive and not very bold, and they asked the Party Committee for instructions on everything big and small. The work of the Party Committee was once trapped in a circle of事務主義 [事務主義 - bureaucratism, or paperwork over practical results], unable to go deep into reality and grasp the main problems. Later, the Party Committee stipulated the scope of work for each department, requiring them to give play to their subjective initiative and to do things boldly. Some problems were discussed with the masses at the lower level. After that, the work of the Party Committee focused on the experimental fields of various departments and the masses. For the experimental fields with achievements, the secretaries personally went deep into the site, held mass symposiums, summarized and improved them, and held on-site meetings to organize promotion. More than 200 such on-site meetings were held last year, and hundreds of sets of typical experiences in various industries were also summarized. Because of the Party Committee's emphasis and support, a trend of engaging in experimental fields and going deep into the masses for research and investigation prevailed in all walks of life throughout the branch, which greatly promoted the overall work.

    In order to make the seventeen branches a strong fighting fortress for penetrating the masses and reality in street work, the Branch Party Committee strengthened the specific leadership of the branches and the specific help and training for the branch secretaries. Of the seventeen branch secretaries in this branch, 80% were street party members and housewives before the establishment of the urban people's commune. Their characteristics were hard work and high enthusiasm, but in the early days of the establishment of the commune, their management ability was poor. They often had to lead factories with hundreds of people, canteens serving thousands of people, or service stations, and their work was quite complicated. The Branch Party Committee believed that grasping this level of party organization was the key to grasping the production and life of the commune. The seventeen members adopted the method of dividing up "apprentices," went deep into the seventeen branches, worked and labored with the branch secretaries, studied and solved problems together, and helped the secretaries and branches establish a set of mass-line working methods. Committee member Deng Yixian lived and worked in the automobile repair factory for more than two months. She helped the factory's branch secretary, Du Xiuyun, to become an outstanding branch secretary. Du Xiuyun was originally a housewife. When she first took office as branch secretary, she did not understand some of the most basic working methods of the party. Because there were many tasks and few methods, she was also impatient. For example, a worker asked to return to his hometown after resigning from the factory. She bluntly criticized him for being "extremely backward" and approved his return home. After Deng Yixian learned about this, she kept the worker, and in the evening, she took Du Xiuyun to talk to the worker. It turned out that the worker did not want to leave. After several days of ideological struggle, he decided to leave because the workshop director had criticized him too much and he could not accept it. Du Xiuyun made an on-the-spot review and explanation to him, and the worker also told the secretary that he would take the factory as his home from now on and would not leave the factory and return home for trivial matters. Deng Yixian also labored in the workshop with Du Xiuyun. When problems arose, she took her to hold mass forums to discuss solutions, and taught her a set of methods for leading production in labor. Now, Du Xiuyun's leadership experience has been summarized and promoted by the Party Committee, and the branch she leads has become one of the best branches in the branch. She has learned lathe work, welding, and general repair techniques. In addition, the Longhai Branch Party Committee also adopted the method of concentrated blitz, concentrating several members in a relatively backward branch. The members set an example themselves, leading the secretary and members of the branch in the factories, canteens, nurseries, and service stations under the branch's jurisdiction, organizing mass forums, understanding the crux of the problem, and then working with the branch secretary, branch committee members, and the masses to study solutions, so that the work of the branch could catch up in an all-round way in a very short time. This also helped the secretary and branch committee members to improve and improve their work style. Through this method, they enabled two relatively backward branches to catch up with the advanced ones. In order to strengthen the work of the branches and to strengthen the political and ideological education of party members, the Branch Party Committee also stipulated the eight major tasks of the branches and the five requirements for party members. Their main spirit is: to go deep into reality, to care about the lives of the masses, and to consult with the masses when problems arise; every party member should be hardworking and thrifty, and deeply grounded in reality. And this is used to measure the work of each branch and each party member.

    The members of the Longhai Branch Party Committee set an example by their own actions and became models of going deep into reality, caring for the masses, and being hardworking and simple. In the past year or so, they spent half a month to twenty days a month working and laboring in commune-run factories, canteens, nurseries, and service stations. In March this year, the commune cadre canteen was abolished, and the secretaries and members all ate in the mass canteen, and it was initially stipulated that they would all eat in the third-class canteen. They helped with accounting, cooking, ordering menus, cleaning up the environment, and discussing and solving various problems with the catering staff, and listened to the masses' discussions and opinions on the canteen. Now, under the specific help of the secretaries and members, all fourteen third-class canteens in the entire branch have been transformed into first- and second-class canteens.

    Because the Longhai Branch Party Committee has a set of working methods and work styles that are closely related to reality, deeply rooted in the masses, hardworking, and pragmatic, they have become the best branch in the city in terms of production, and the welfare benefits are the first in the entire management area. The Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee has held an organizational work conference here to systematically summarize their experience and promote it in the Party Committees of the city's people's communes.

　　深入基层“带徒弟”　“有的放矢”帮下级
　　郑州红旗公社陇海分社党委会成员深入群众深入实际充分发挥党的战斗作用
    本报讯　中共郑州市红旗人民公社陇海分社委员会，从组织领导到工作作风，形成了一套深入群众、深入实际的工作方法，出色地发挥了党的战斗作用。
    陇海分社有七千多户，三万多口人，有自己的工业、农业、商业、文教卫生事业和福利事业。全分社有十七个党支部。分社党委充分地估计了城市人民公社既抓生产又抓生活的复杂性，认为首先要在组织领导上走群众路线，运用各方面的力量，使自己在群众中和各项工作中有千百万只眼睛。因此，他们对妇联、共青团组织、商业、粮食、银行、文教、福利等和群众的生产生活有密切关系的部门，除了加强对工作人员的政治思想教育外，还对他们深入实际、深入群众的具体办法作了规定，要求并支持他们搞各种各样的试验田。起初，这些部门的工作被动、不大胆，大大小小的事情都去请示党委，党委的工作曾一度陷于事务主义的圈子，不能深入实际，抓住主要问题。后来党委给各部门规定了工作范围，要求他们发挥主观能动性，大胆地去做，有些问题在下边和群众商量。之后，党委的工作集中在各部门和群众的试验田上。对于有成绩的试验田，书记们亲自深入现场，召开群众座谈会，加以总结提高，并召开现场会议，组织推广。去年一年开过二百多次这样的现场会议，也总结出几百套各行各业的典型经验。因为党委的重视和支持，全分社各行各业大兴搞试验田、深入群众研究调查之风，对全面的工作起了很大的推动作用。
    为了使十七个支部成为街道工作中深入群众、深入实际的强有力的战斗堡垒，分社党委加强了对支部的具体领导和对支部书记的具体帮助和培养。这个分社的十七名支部书记，80％是城市人民公社成立前的街道党员、家庭妇女。他们的特点是工作艰苦，热情很高，但在公社成立初期，管理能力较差，他们往往要领导有几百人的工厂、为几千人服务的食堂或服务站等，工作相当复杂。分社党委认为，抓好这一级党组织，是抓好公社生产、生活的关键。十七位委员采取分工“带徒弟”的办法，深入十七个支部，和支部书记一起工作、劳动，一起研究和解决问题，帮助书记和支部建立一套群众路线的工作方法。邓怡娴委员在汽车修配厂吃住劳动两个多月，她帮助这个厂的支部书记杜秀云，使她成为一位出色的支部书记。杜秀云原来是家庭妇女，开始担任支部书记时，对党的一些最基本的工作方法还不大懂，因为工作头绪多，办法少，也有急躁情绪。例如：有一个工人要求退厂回家，她生硬地批评他“死落后”，并批准了他回家。邓怡娴知道这事后，留住了这个工人，晚上又带杜秀云去找这个工人谈话。原来这个工人并不想走，经过几天的思想斗争，才决定要走，原因是车间主任批评他太过分，他接受不了。杜秀云当场向他作了检讨和解释，这位工人也在支书面前表示今后要以厂为家，不能为一点小事就要离厂回家。邓怡娴还和杜秀云一起在车间劳动，遇有问题，带着她召开群众座谈会讨论解决，教给她如何在劳动中领导生产的一套办法。现在杜秀云的领导经验已被党委总结推广，她领导的支部成为分社最好的支部之一。她自己学会了车床、电焊和一般修理等技术。另外，陇海分社党委还采取集中突击的办法，集中几个委员在一个比较落后的支部。委员自己以身作则，带着这个支部的书记、支委在支部所属的工厂、食堂、托儿所、服务站劳动，组织群众座谈，了解问题的症结所在，然后和支部书记、支委、群众一起研究出办法，使支部工作在很短时间内，全面赶上去。这样也帮助书记和支部委员提高、改进工作作风。他们通过这个办法，使两个比较落后的支部赶上了先进。为了加强支部工作，加强党员政治思想教育，分社党委还规定了支部工作的八大任务和党员的五项要求，它们的主要精神是：深入实际，关心群众生活，遇事和群众商量；每个党员要艰苦朴素，深入踏实。并以此来衡量每个支部的工作和每个党员。
    陇海分社党委的委员们，自己以身作则，成为深入实际，关心群众，艰苦朴素的模范。一年多来，他们每月有半个月到二十天的时间，在社办工厂、食堂、托儿所、服务站里办公和劳动。今年3月，公社干部食堂取消，书记和委员们全在群众食堂吃饭，开始还规定都在三类食堂吃饭。他们在食堂帮助算账，做饭，订菜谱，打扫环境卫生，和炊管人员一起商量，解决各种问题，倾听群众对于食堂的议论和意见。现在全分社十四个三类食堂，在书记和委员们的具体帮助下，已转变为一、二类食堂。
    陇海分社党委会由于有一套联系实际，深入群众，艰苦踏实的工作方法和工作作风，使他们在生产上成为全市最好的分社，生活福利在全管理区第一。中共郑州市委曾在这里开过组织工作会议，系统地总结他们的经验，在全市人民公社党委中推广。
