    Chairman Travels All Over the Country (Traditional Chinese Painting)
    Li Qi
    Chairman travels all over the country, the mountains are happy and the waters are happy,
    Mount Emei raises its hands to present treasures, the Yellow River wags its tail and sings.
    Chairman travels all over the country, workers are happy and farmers are happy,
    Mountains of grain and mountains of cotton soar to the sky,
    Steel water and iron water become rivers.
    ——Hebei Folk Song

    主席走遍全国（国画）
    李琦主席走遍全国，山也乐来水也乐，峨嵋举手献宝，黄河摇尾唱歌。主席走遍全国，工也乐来农也乐，粮山棉山冲天，钢水铁水成河。
    ——河北民歌
