Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The "Chollima Workteam" movement, launched by the Korean working people in the spring of last year, is flourishing. To date, more than 100,000 workers, farmers, and technicians, and more than 5,000 advanced collectives have joined this new type of socialist competition movement, and 594 workteams have won the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam."

The development of this movement has further enhanced the enthusiasm and consciousness of the working people, and brought about a new look in their work, life, and study.

Each advanced collective participating in this movement regards increasing labor productivity as its primary fighting goal. To this end, many Chollima workteams have adopted resolutions stating that each person should put forward at least two rationalization proposals per year. They also strive to adopt advanced operation methods to promote the mechanization and automation of production. The workers of the Chen Yingyuan Chollima Workteam of the Jiangxian Steel Plant, who first initiated this movement, adopted various concrete measures to extend the life of the steelmaking electric furnace and greatly increase labor productivity. In the past, an electric furnace could refine steel twenty-five times before requiring repairs, but now it can refine thirty-five times. In the past, thirty tons of steel were produced at a time, but now it reaches thirty-three tons.

The "Chollima Workteam" movement has played a significant role in carrying out communist education among the working people and has improved the consciousness of workers' labor. Many workteams have launched a movement to repair their own machines. Many workteams not only prepare labor tools and raw materials for themselves but also for the next shift, helping others to prepare the conditions for completing production tasks. In this movement, it has become the norm for the advanced to help the backward. For example, the workers of the Zhu Chengyi Chollima Workteam of the Longcheng Machinery Factory taught their advanced operation methods to sixteen other workteams, and also solved more than one hundred tools and fixtures for other workteams, enabling everyone to over fulfill the production plan.

This movement has also promoted workers' cultural and technical learning, enabling them to systematically improve their cultural and technical levels.

Currently, this movement is developing more and more widely among the Korean working people. Since this spring, farmers have also participated in this movement. The Wen Zhengshu Workteam of the Qingshanli Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangxi County, South Pyongan Province, took the lead in striving for the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam." Now many advanced workteams of agricultural cooperatives have passed resolutions to participate in this movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar: The movement of the Mongolian working people to strive for the title of Socialist Labor Brigade is widely carried out in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and agricultural and animal husbandry sectors, and it has become an advanced form of competition in socialist production and construction at the current stage.

Since the Central Committee of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League called on the youth of the whole country last spring to "work, study, and live in a socialist way" and strive to become a Socialist Labor Brigade, young workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and agricultural and animal husbandry sectors have put forward competition targets to strive to become a Socialist Labor Brigade, striving to improve work results, strengthen learning, help each other, and live a collective life. Before July this year, eight Socialist Labor Brigades had been approved in industrial and transport, agricultural and animal husbandry, and other units across the country. Recently, the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League decided to award two construction worker production teams the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade," increasing the number of such labor brigades to ten.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian people warmly support and approve this new movement that embodies collectivist ideas. It attracts a wide range of employees. At present, more than 460 production teams, including more than 4,500 people, are striving to become Socialist Labor Brigades throughout the country.

Since the launch of this movement, it has had a huge impact on Mongolia's production and construction. The production task of striving for a Socialist Labor Brigade is to break through the old production indicators, reach advanced indicators, increase labor productivity, improve production methods, reduce product costs, and achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy. After setting targets, many production teams cooperated with each other, and the face of production was completely renewed. For example, a production team led by construction worker Chao Gao, after proposing the task of striving for the title of Socialist Labor Brigade in October last year, completed the original production plan one month ahead of schedule on July 1 this year. During this period, the plan was completed by 127% to 289% each month. The team members put forward rationalization proposals for using waste materials in production, which resulted in saving more than 38,000 tugriks for the country. This production team has recently won the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade." The movement also plays a significant role in promoting workers' study of politics and culture, as well as living a collective life. The production team systematically studies political current events, learns culture, and also collectively participates in sports and other recreational activities, cares about each other's family life, and promotes savings.

At the same time as this movement was launched, more than 80 intellectual cooperation teams also emerged. They are composed of engineers, teachers, writers, actors, and experts and scholars, and cooperate with Socialist Labor Brigades to help labor brigades learn and improve their political, technical, and cultural levels. The members of the cooperation team also help and cooperate with each other to jointly improve their ideological awareness and professional level.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The nationwide competition in the Soviet Union to complete the magnificent plan for communist construction ahead of schedule has seen new developments.

In the past two months, Party organizations and economic departments in many regions of the country have held meetings one after another to discuss measures to accelerate technological progress, tap production potential, and complete production plans ahead of schedule in light of local conditions. Factories and enterprises in various economic regions and cities have made striving to complete the first half of this year's production plan ahead of schedule as their goal. Production good news from all over the country shows that their goal has been successfully achieved one after another. The industrial enterprises in Moscow completed the first half of the year's production plan as early as June 23; by the end of June, they had over-produced products worth hundreds of millions of rubles beyond the plan. Thanks to a series of effective measures taken by the workers and scientific research and design institutes in the city's enterprises in developing technological progress, more than one hundred automated production lines, mechanized production lines, and conveyor belts were installed in the city's enterprises in the first half of this year.

In the nationwide competition, many economic regions have further revised their original plans to ensure that various production targets stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan are completed ahead of schedule in a shorter time than originally planned. For example, the broad masses of workers and staff in Sverdlovsk Oblast proposed that, without increasing basic investment, the industrial production level of the Seven-Year Plan should be reached within five years, instead of the six years proposed in the past.

The employees of the ferrous metallurgical enterprises in the Dnepropetrovsk Economic Region have formulated a concrete plan to increase labor productivity. The implementation of this plan will enable the labor productivity of the ferrous metallurgical enterprises in the entire region to double the originally stipulated target in the Seven-Year Plan, thereby freeing up 20,000 workers.

Employees in various regions have put forward a large number of valuable initiatives and suggestions for improving production and tapping internal potential. A communist labor brigade at the Tbilisi Lenin Electric Locomotive Factory guaranteed that, by increasing labor productivity, saving raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and improving production technology, the funds they saved throughout the year would exceed the total of all team members' annual salaries, that is, saving 166,000 rubles. The Ural Automobile Factory will use the materials saved this year to produce 300 cars above the plan.

　　开展劳动竞赛　推动生产建设
　　朝鲜“千里马作业班”运动蓬勃发展许多农民开始投入运动
　　蒙古人民争取社会主义劳动队称号运动对生产建设影响巨大
　　苏联各地企业的工人挖掘生产潜力革新技术提高了生产指标
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜劳动人民从去年春天展开的“千里马作业班”运动正在蓬勃发展。到目前为止，已有工人、农民、技术人员等十万多人，五千多个先进集体涌入了这个新型的社会主义竞赛运动，并且已有五百九十四个作业班荣获了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。
    这一运动的开展，进一步提高了劳动人民的积极性和自觉性，使他们的劳动、生活和学习都出现了新的面貌。
    参加这一运动的每个先进集体都把提高劳动生产率当作首要的战斗目标。为此，许多千里马作业班通过决议，表示每个人一年至少要提出两项合理化建议。他们并努力采用先进的作业方法，促进生产的机械化和自动化。首先发起这一运动的降仙炼钢厂陈应源千里马作业班的工人们就采用了各种具体措施延长了炼钢的电炉的寿命，大大提高了劳动生产率。过去电炉补修一次炼二十五次钢，现在能炼三十五次。过去一次出钢三十吨，现在达到三十三吨。
    “千里马作业班”运动对于在劳动人民中进行共产主义教育起了很大的作用，提高了工人们劳动的自觉性。许多作业班展开了自己检修机器的运动。许多作业班不仅为自己而且为下一班准备好劳动工具、原料，帮助别人准备好完成生产任务的条件。在这一运动中，先进帮助后进已经成为风气。例如龙城机械工厂的朱成一千里马作业班的工人就把自己的先进作业方法教给了另外的十六个作业班，还为其它作业班解决了一百多件工具和卡具，使大家都超额完成了生产计划。
    这个运动还推动了工人们的文化、技术学习，使他们的文化、技术水平得到系统的提高。
    目前，这一运动正在朝鲜劳动人民中越来越广泛地发展。从今春开始，农民也参加了这一运动。平安南道江西郡青山里农业社文贞淑作业班首先发起要争取“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。现在已有许多农业社的先进作业班通过决议，参加这一运动。
    据新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古劳动人民争取社会主义劳动队称号的运动在工矿企业、交通运输和农牧业部门中广泛展开，它已成为目前阶段社会主义生产建设中的高级竞赛形式。
    自去年春天蒙古革命青年团中央号召全国青年“以社会主义的方式工作、学习和生活”并争取成为社会主义劳动队以来，工矿企业、交通运输和农牧业部门的青年职工们纷纷提出争取成为社会主义劳动队的竞赛指标，努力提高工作效果，加强学习、相互帮助，过集体的生活。在今年7月以前，全国在工业交通、农牧业等单位批准了八个社会主义劳动队。最近蒙古工会中央理事会和革命青年团中央又决定授给两个建筑工人生产队以“社会主义劳动队”称号，使这种劳动队增加到十个。
    蒙古人民革命党和蒙古人民热烈支持和赞同这一个表现了集体主义思想的新运动。它吸引着广大的职工。现在在全国争取成为社会主义劳动队的生产队已经达到四百六十多个，包括四千五百多人。
    这个运动开展以来，在蒙古的生产建设中发生了巨大影响。争取社会主义劳动队的生产任务是突破旧的生产指标，达到先进指标，提高劳动生产率，改进生产方法，降低产品成本，达到增产节约的目的。许多生产队制定指标后互相协作，生产面貌焕然一新。例如，由建筑工人朝高领导的一个生产队，从去年10月开始提出争取社会主义劳动队称号的任务后，在今年7月1日提前一个月完成了原定的生产计划。在此期间每个月完成了计划的127％到289％。队员们提出了在生产中利用废料的合理化建议，结果为国家节约了三万八千多图格里克。这个生产队最近已荣获“社会主义劳动队”的称号。运动在促进职工学习政治、文化以及过集体的生活方面也有很大作用。生产队有计划的学习政治时事，学习文化，还集体参加体育和其他文娱活动，互相关怀家庭生活，提倡储蓄。
    在这个运动开展的同时，还出现了八十多个知识分子协作队。他们是由工程师、教师、作家、演员和专家、学者组成的，和争取社会主义劳动队协作，帮助劳动队学习，提高政治、技术和文化水平。协作队的队员之间也相互帮助、协作，共同提高思想觉悟和业务水平。
    据新华社莫斯科电　苏联争取提前完成共产主义建设宏伟计划的全民竞赛又有了新的发展。
    近两个月来，全国许多地区的共产党组织和经济部门都先后举行会议，结合本地区的情况讨论了加速技术进步、挖掘生产潜力和提前完成生产计划的措施。各经济区和城市的工厂企业都把争取提前完成今年上半年生产计划作为奋斗目标。从各地传来的生产捷报表明，它们的这一目标都相继顺利地实现了。莫斯科市的工业企业早在6月23日就完成了上半年生产计划；而到6月末又超计划生产了价值数亿卢布的产品。由于各厂职工和科学研究、设计机关的工作人员在发展技术进步方面采取了一系列有效措施，今年上半年在全市的企业中安装了一百多条自动化作业线、机械化作业线和传运带。
    许多经济区在全民竞赛中还进一步修改了原订计划，保证在比原计划更短的时间内提前完成七年计划规定的各项生产指标。例如，斯维德洛夫斯克州的广大职工提出，在不增加基本投资的情况下，在五年内，而不是过去提出的在六年内，达到七年计划的工业生产水平。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克经济区黑色冶金企业的职工制定了提高劳动生产率的具体计划。实现这个计划，就可以使全区黑色冶金企业的劳动生产率在七年计划中比原来规定的指标再提高一倍，从而腾出两万名工人。
    各地区的职工在改进生产和挖掘内部潜力方面提出了大量宝贵的倡议和建议。第比利斯列宁电气机车制造厂的一个共产主义劳动队保证，通过提高劳动生产率、节约原材料、燃料和电力，通过改进生产技术等措施，他们全年节约的资金要超过所有队员全年工资的总和，即节约十六万六千卢布。乌拉尔汽车制造厂今年将用节约下来的材料超计划生产三百辆汽车。
