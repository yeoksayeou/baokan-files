Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 25th: According to the Cambodian newspaper "Neutral Daily," the patriotic people of Tu Mo, Coc Linh, Xo Lot, Rong Non, and Tu Di in Long An Province, South Vietnam, rose up in self-defense on June 22nd to oppose the U.S.-Ngo clique's forced relocation to "agrovilles," defeating an attack by a battalion of the U.S.-Ngo clique's "Capital Regiment."

The report stated that on that day, the U.S.-Ngo clique dispatched the "Tran Le Xuan Battalion" (approximately 300 soldiers) of the "Capital Regiment" to the aforementioned areas to carry out bloody suppression of those who refused to move to the "agrovilles." When this army arrived in the Tu Mo and Coc Linh areas, they were met with armed resistance from the local people, and fierce fighting ensued for more than two hours. As a result, the U.S.-Ngo clique's army was badly defeated and fled in disarray, abandoning their dead. More than 40 U.S.-Ngo soldiers were killed in the battle, and their bodies were not removed until the next day by helicopters and oxcarts sent by the U.S.-Ngo clique.

Local newspapers also reported the ambush and killing of Nguyen Van Phung, a "lieutenant colonel" and trusted henchman of Ngo Dinh Diem. Nguyen Van Phung held an important position in the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's "General Youth Directorate" and had consistently committed evil deeds, earning the hatred of the masses. He was killed by local patriotic people on June 26th while returning to Saigon from Tay Nguyen after plotting to build more concentration camps.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 23rd: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, the record of bloody crimes committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique against the people of South Vietnam has been further augmented.

According to Radio Phnom Penh on the 18th, Ngo Dinh Diem's armed forces killed approximately 200 people during a 24-hour search operation in Phong Dinh (Can Tho) Province, southwest of Saigon, South Vietnam, on July 9th. According to the radio station, they also wounded 100 people and abducted 28.

The main purpose of this search was to suppress the rising anti-U.S.-Ngo movement in the province, especially in Cai Be District. The U.S.-Ngo clique is doing everything possible to force local residents into a large concentration center there.

According to Saigon Radio, in the first half of this month alone, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, with the support of American military advisors, launched continuous suppression searches against peaceful residents in many provinces of South Vietnam. During these searches, 125 peaceful residents were killed, 133 were seriously injured, 35 were arrested, and a large amount of people's property was looted, including many livestock.

According to a protest letter from the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Commission, during the first five months of this year, there was an average of 100 suppression actions called "pacification activities" per month in Ben Tre Province, southwest of Saigon.

Meanwhile, it was revealed that the South Vietnamese authorities set a large fire in Tan Chau District, Chau Doc Province, in early April this year to turn the area into a concentration center. As a result of this arson attack, 1,200 houses were burned down, leaving 6,000 people homeless. South Vietnamese newspapers have revealed that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are currently preventing the victims of the fire from rebuilding their houses on land that has already been divided into several areas.

Tan Chau is the industrial center of South Vietnam. Since 1957, Ngo Dinh Diem has repeatedly ordered the people there to move into concentration centers, but this has been strongly opposed by the people.

    越南南方人民坚决展开反逼迁斗争
    隆安省人民武装痛击美吴军
    吴庭艳军队在丰定省残杀居民二百人
    新华社河内25日电　据此间报纸援引柬埔寨“中立报”的消息，越南南方隆安省土模、谷灵、梭勒、绒嫩和土地等地的爱国人民，为了反对美吴集团强迫他们集中到“稠密区”居住，在6月22日奋起自卫，击溃了美吴集团“首都中团”一个营的进攻。
    消息说，这天，美吴集团派出了“首都中团”的“陈丽春营”（约三百多人）前往上述地区，对拒绝搬到“稠密区”居住的人进行血腥镇压。当这支军队来到土模、谷灵地区时，便受到当地人民的武装反抗，双方激战了两个多小时。结果美吴集团的军队被打得落花流水，弃尸溃逃。在这次激战中，美吴军队被打死四十多人，他们的尸体直到第二天才被美吴集团派来的直升飞机和牛车运走。
    这里的报纸还报道了吴庭艳的得力走狗阮文逢“中校”被人民伏击打死的消息。阮文逢在吴庭艳集团的“青年总署”担任要职，一贯为非作歹，群众恨之入骨。他是在6月26日到西原策划增建集中营后回西贡途中被当地爱国人民打死的。
    新华社河内23日电　据越南通讯社报道，吴庭艳集团对越南南方人民所犯下的血腥罪行的纪录又增添了新的一页。
    据金边电台18日透露，吴庭艳的武装部队7月9日在越南南方西贡西南面的丰定（芹苴）省进行的二十四小时搜捕中杀死大约二百人。据这家电台报道，他们还打伤一百人和劫走二十八人。
    这次搜捕的主要目的是镇压该省的、特别是丐德县日益高涨的反对美吴运动。美吴集团在那里千方百计地把当地居民赶进一个大集中中心。
    据西贡电台报道，仅仅在本月上半月，吴庭艳当局在美国军事顾问的支持下对越南南方的许多省的和平居民连续发动镇压搜捕。在这几次搜捕期间，有一百二十五名和平居民被杀死。一百三十三人受重伤，三十五人被捕，人民的大量财产被抢走，其中包括许多牲口。
    据越南人民军总司令部联络代表团给国际委员会的抗议信中说，在今年头五个月期间，在西贡西南面的槟椥省一个月平均有一百次名为“平定活动”的镇压行动。
    同时，据透露越南南方当局今年4月初在朱笃省新州县放了一次大火，目的是把这个地区变成一个集中中心。这次放火行动的结果，烧毁了一千二百所房子，使六千人无家可归。越南南部的报纸透露，目前，吴庭艳当局正在阻止这次大火的受难者在已经被分成几个地区的土地上重建他们的房子。
    新州是越南南方的产业中心。自从1957年以来，吴庭艳曾经多次命令那里的人民搬进集中中心，但是遭到了人民的强烈反对。
