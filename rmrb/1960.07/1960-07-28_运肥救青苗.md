Be Good Agricultural Transporters

    Transporting Fertilizer to Save Seedlings
    One evening, dozens of tugboats and barges, large and small, from a certain fleet rapidly converged on Huangpu Wharf. The hearts of the crew members had already flown past the wharf, to the rural areas of Shunde County, Guangdong, more than a hundred miles away. There, large swathes of seedlings were withering due to fertilizer deficiency. The Party demanded that the crew members immediately rush to transport four thousand tons of chemical fertilizer to save the seedlings. This was the most direct way to support agricultural production, and the crew members only regretted that the ships were not running faster.
    The ships docked. A long line of people formed, buzzing with activity; mountain-like piles of fertilizer were being poured into the ships. … Two days later, four thousand tons of fertilizer arrived at Rongqi.
    Rongqi is a small port that can only load and unload a few hundred tons per day. Now, four thousand tons of fertilizer had suddenly arrived, an unprecedented event and an unprecedented challenge; how to handle it? The Party General Branch of the fleet sent the captain to personally oversee the matter. The captain, dockworkers, and crew members held a field meeting at the wharf. The captain said, "This is fertilizer, and large swathes of seedlings in Shunde County are waiting for it!" As a result, the entire wharf was abuzz with activity, with hundreds and thousands of hands raised in the crowd. The workers said in unison, "Supporting agriculture is our sacred duty. We resolutely respond to the Party's call to transport the fertilizer immediately." Kong Zhuding, a mother of four, had already unloaded coal all day, and tonight she came to unload fertilizer in a crash effort. When people asked her to rest, she said that she could rest at other times, but she could not rest when transporting fertilizer to save seedlings; many crew members from different ships came out in full force. Two more days passed, and the fertilizer arrived in the countryside. …
    A few days ago, news came from Rongqi: Those seedlings are now growing lush and green…

    运肥救青苗
    一天晚上，某船队的拖轮、驳船，大大小小几十艘，迅速向黄埔码头集中；船员们的心，已经越过码头，飞向百多里以外的广东顺德县农村。那里，有大片青苗因为失肥而正在枯萎。党要求船员们，马上将四千吨化学肥料火速抢运，挽救青苗。这是最直接支援农业生产的时候了，船员们只恨轮船跑得太慢。
    船靠岸了。人排成的长龙，闹哄哄；山一样的肥料，向船里倾泄着。……两天以后，四千吨的肥料，到达了容奇。
    容奇是个小港口，一天只能装卸几百吨。而今，四千吨肥料一下子靠岸了，这是空前的盛事，又是空前的困难；怎样吞吐它？船队党总支派船长亲自主持这件事。船长和港口装卸工人以及船员在码头开战地会议，船长说：“这是肥料，顺德县有大片青苗等着它！”于是整个码头沸腾起来了，人群中百千双手高举起来，工人们异口同声说：“支援农业是我们的天职，坚决响应党的号召，将肥料马上运出去。”四个孩子的妈妈孔柱丁，白天已卸了一天煤，今晚又来突击装卸肥料。大家叫她休息，她表示，别的时候可以休息，运肥救青苗可不能休息；许多船的职工都是倾船而出，全力以赴。又两天，肥料到达了农村。……
    前几天，从容奇传来消息：那片青苗现在已长得郁郁苍苍……
