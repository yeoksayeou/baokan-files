    My Assistant
    Dong Yao

    Just half a month ago, the brigade's Secretary Zhou said to me, "Uncle Sun, seeing you so busy feeding the livestock makes everyone feel uneasy. We've decided to assign you an assistant." The next day, he brought a man in his late thirties to my feeding room. This man was tall with a ruddy complexion, and he smiled even before speaking, making you feel familiar at first sight. However, I couldn't recall where I had seen him before. Secretary Zhou said to me, "This is your assistant, his surname is also Sun. You can call him Old Sun from now on. He's very diligent, but lacks some technical skills." I said, "That's nothing. Farm work doesn't require much learning; he can just follow what others do."

    My assistant is indeed very diligent. He prepares the fodder and grass every day and keeps the livestock pens clean all the time. I'm not boasting, but I've never slacked off on feeding the livestock. However, these days, whenever I think about going to work, this assistant has already finished everything. This is common in rural families, but there’s more to tell. This assistant not only feeds the livestock well, but he also constantly asks questions, inquiring about my experience in feeding livestock and suggesting improvements to our feeding room. I told him, "Old Sun! You can rest assured when feeding the cattle and donkeys with me. I've been taking care of livestock for landlords since I was a child, endured a lot of hardship, and learned a bit about feeding livestock. Now I'm feeding our commune's livestock, and I won't slack off."

    Summer rain is truly unpredictable. It can be sunny during the day, but a heavy rain might fall at night. These past few days, it’s been drizzling frequently. When it's hot and dry, the livestock can be fed outside, but when it rains, they have to be brought inside. Another bad thing about summer is the abundance of mosquitoes and horseflies. When it rains, the cattle shed buzzes loudly. I used to worry about this. One night, it rained all night, and after bringing the livestock inside, I could hear them kicking and stomping constantly. My assistant first sprayed some insecticide and then used a fan. I said, "It's no use! We've tried this method many times." Then he squatted by the trough, thinking.

    He suddenly said to me, "Uncle Sun, couldn't we open large windows at the front and back of this room to improve ventilation? Wouldn't that be much better!" I thought it made sense at the time; good ventilation would keep the place cool and blow away the mosquitoes and flies, and adding some insecticide would do the trick.

    We started working that night, and in one night and a day, the three large feeding rooms were renovated like classrooms in a foreign school: large windows, cool and breezy. The next night, it rained again, but the cattle and donkeys didn't kick; all I could hear was the sound of them munching on grass.

    I really regret this. I blame myself: after being a cattle feeder for decades, I'm not as good as an assistant for three days. How can I explain this to Secretary Zhou! But at the same time, I'm happy: seeing the cattle and donkeys eating their fill and sleeping so soundly on rainy nights makes me happy. From that moment on, I guessed that my assistant was a capable person, certainly more capable than me.

    Because of this, the commune later held an on-site meeting here.

    It's really strange! I know all the feeders within ten or twenty miles, but I didn't recognize most of the feeders who came this time. My assistant spoke about the knowledge of feeding livestock, and the principles of caring for livestock as if he was a big cadre and everyone listened with rapt attention. I really admire him. I pulled Secretary Zhou aside and asked him, "Old Zhou, is my assistant not an ordinary person?" Secretary Zhou said, "Why bother asking about that? Just teach him all your skills in feeding livestock." I said, "That won't do. You have to introduce this person's background to me."

    Secretary Zhou then said to me, "Uncle Sun, your assistant is not simple! He is our county Party secretary. He was previously responsible for other aspects of work in the county Party committee and didn't come here often. Now he's here with us to lead production on the front lines."

    One sentence stunned me: Sun… Secretary…

    Secretary Zhou said, "Yes, don't be surprised! Just be the same as usual, don't make any exceptions; otherwise, Secretary Sun will criticize me."

    The county Party secretary is working as an assistant to me, a former long-term laborer. My energy is full. I want to find a way to work harder. I asked the brigade for an alarm clock, and set it to ring every day at three in the morning, to wake up and go to work.

    This really works. After two days, when my assistant got up, I had already finished everything. On the third day, the alarm clock didn't work. After it rang, I opened my eyes, and the sun was high in the sky. I looked at the clock; it was exactly six o'clock. How strange! Looking closely, someone had moved the hands of the alarm clock. The next night, I reset it. But as soon as it rang, the sun came out again. I was really angry. Who deliberately wanted me to fall behind! On the third night, I didn't sleep; I kept my eyes open. In the middle of the night, someone came in. He found the alarm clock in the dark, secretly turned on a flashlight, and was about to adjust it when I caught him.

    Who do you think it was? It was my assistant. Seeing my anxious expression, he spoke first, "Uncle Sun, you are old, and you have suffered for most of your life. Let me do more of the work!" I said, "That won't do! You are the county Party secretary, your workload is already heavy enough. Let me do more of the work!" Secretary Sun smiled and said, "Isn't the county Party secretary the same as everyone else? If I can't even do a good job of feeding livestock, do you think I can be a good secretary?"

    My face was hot, I couldn't say anything anymore; I touched my nose and two streams of tears flowed out.

    What happened after that, is what happened after that, I can't say yet. Anyway, Secretary Sun is still with me.

    我的助手
    董尧
    还是半月以前，大队周书记对我说：“孙大爷，看你喂牲口这样忙，大伙心里怪不安的，决定派个助手给你。”第二天他就领着一个三十七、八岁的人来到我的饲养室。这人高高的个儿，赤红面皮，不说话就先笑，一见面就有三分熟，可是我怎么样也想不起哪里见过他。周书记对我说：“这就是你的助手，他也姓孙。以后你叫他老孙就行了；这个人很勤快，只是技术欠缺点。”我说：“这没啥，庄稼人干的活，没啥学，别人咋着他咋着就成。”
    我这个助手可真勤快，水草天天准备得齐齐全全，牛铺时刻打扫得干干净净。我不是自夸，喂牲口这活我可没松过一点劲，可是，这些天，我一想起去干活，早就被这个助手干完了。庄户人家，这也算不得什么。我要说的事还多；这个助手不光喂牲口喂得好，他还时刻问这问那，问我喂牲口有什么经验，咱这个喂养室有什么要改进；我说啦：“老孙呀！跟着大爷喂牛驴你就放心吧，大爷从小娃娃的时候起，就跟着爹给地主看牲口，苦受了不少，喂牲口的本事也学会一点，眼下是喂咱们公社的牲口，我是不会放松的。”
    夏天的雨水，可真是神出鬼没，白天晴晴的，晚黑就说不定下大雨。这几天三天两头不住点。天热了，没雨牲口可以在外边喂，一下雨就要往屋里拉。夏天还有件不好的事，蚊子、牛蝇多，一到下雨牛屋里轰轰响。过去我就发过愁。这天又下了一晚上雨，把牲口拉到屋里，我听得一个一个噗通通的踢蹄打腿。我那助手先是喷喷药，后来又用扇扇。我说：“不顶事呀！这办法用过多少遍了。”后来他就蹲在槽头上想。
    他忽然对我说：“孙大爷，咱们这里屋前后能开上大窗户，通通风，不就好得多了吗！”当时我想也是个理；又通风凉快，又能刮走蚊蝇，再加上喷点药，就行了。
    夜里我们就干起来，一宿一天的工夫，三间大饲养室整修得像洋学堂的教室一样：大大的窗户，凉凉飕飕的。第二天晚黑又下雨，牛驴就不踢了，只听得咯??的吃草。
    这件事我真后悔，我怪我自己：当了几十年喂牛工，还不如三天的助手，我怎么向周书记交代呀！但同时我也乐：看看牛驴吃得鼓鼓的肚，下雨晚上又睡得那么足，就开心。就从那回起，我猜想我的助手是个有本事的人，准比我有能耐。
    就是因为这一件事，后来公社还在这里开了个现场会。
    真奇怪呀！前后左右，十里二十里的饲养员，我没有认不得的，可是这次来的饲养员，一大半认不得。我那助手像个大干部似的讲喂牲口的学问，讲怎样关心牲口的道理，大家听得入了迷。我真佩服他。我把周书记拉到一边，问他：“老周，我这个助手不是平常人呀？”周书记说：“打听那干啥，把你喂牲口的本事全教给他就是了。”我说：“那可不成呀，你得对我介绍介绍这个人的来历。”
    周书记这才对我说：“孙大爷，你的助手可不简单呀！他是咱们县委书记，以前因为他在县委负责别的方面的工作，不常到我们这里来，现在他在我们这里，是到生产第一线上来领导生产的。”
    一句话把我惊呆了：孙……书……记……
    周书记说：“对，你不必惊奇呀！你只要和往常一样，可不能例外；要不孙书记可要批评我了。”
    县委书记跟我这个老长工出身的人当助手，我的劲头可足了。我要想个方法多干活。我向大队要了个闹钟，要它天天早晨三点就闹，闹醒了就去干活。
    这真顶事，以后两天，我那助手起来，我早就干了个一干二净。第三天，这闹钟就不灵了，打响以后，我一睁眼，太阳一竿子高，我看看钟，六点正正的。真怪，细看看，谁把闹钟的针给拨动了。第二天晚上，我又拨过来。可是一打响，太阳又出来了。我真气，谁存心想叫我落后呀！第三天夜里我不睡了，我一直睁着眼。才半夜，进来一个人，他摸黑找着那个闹钟，偷偷地打手电筒，正要拨，被我捉住了。
    你说是谁？正是我的助手。他看到我紧张的样子，先开了腔：“孙大爷，你老人家年岁大了，再说也受了大半辈子苦，能干的活还是让我多干吧！”我说：“那不行呀！你是县委书记，工作担子就够重的了，活还是我多干吧！”孙书记笑了，他说：“县委书记不是一样吗？如果连个饲养都不能干好，你说能当好书记吗？”
    我的脸一阵一阵热呼呼，我再也说不出啥来了；我摸摸鼻梁，流出两道热泪。
    以后的事怎么样，那是以后的事，我还说不上来。反正孙书记一直还是和我在一起。
