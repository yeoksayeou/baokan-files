    A Month Surpasses Several Years
    – Some Experiences from Participating in Cultural Work Serving Construction Sites
    Chi Bin
    Some of our art workers, in participating in the cultural service team organized by the Shandong Provincial Cultural Bureau and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, have greatly improved in their thinking and creation.

    First of all, we deeply realized that art can only shine when it serves politics and production. However, how to combine with production labor and use art creation to directly serve production was not very clear to us at the beginning. When we first arrived at the construction site, many comrades still had the idea that service and creation were contradictory. Some comrades were even unwilling to do art propaganda and art guidance work on the construction site in order to engage in creation. But the facts have proved that art propaganda and guidance work not only do not contradict creation, but also greatly enrich and promote creation, making creation more vital. When we first arrived at Weishan, it was the third phase of the Weishan key project "cutoff," which forced the rampant and unruly Yellow River to change its course according to people's will, and was also the main project of the entire Weishan. At this time, the main propaganda task of the construction site's Party committee was to mobilize millions of migrant workers to establish lofty ambitions and cut off the Yellow River to lock the dragon. In this situation, we picked up our drawing tools, went deep into various combat grassroots units, lived with the construction site staff, and jointly carried out propaganda work. We turned various political slogans into posters and pasted them in propaganda sheds, and turned the constantly emerging heroic figures and deeds into portraits and serial cartoons and pasted them on the construction site's competition platform. At the same time, we criticized some erroneous ideas in the form of cartoons, and turned the fiery struggle situation of the construction site into sketches, traditional Chinese paintings, and watercolor paintings, etc., and exhibited them in the propaganda sheds in a timely manner. We also held a "Cutting off the Yellow River Sketch Exhibition" and arranged a socialist education exhibition, which were warmly welcomed by the masses. In this way, the art weapon greatly played the role of encouraging labor enthusiasm, inspiring advanced figures to be more advanced, and backward figures to catch up with the advanced. Our creations were not only loved by the migrant worker comrades, encouraged their labor enthusiasm, and promoted the progress of the project, but also a profound education for ourselves.

    Through construction site life, we deeply realized that education can only be vivid and colorful when it is combined with production labor. "One month on the construction site is better than reading books for ten years," which is the common experience of many of us. Before going to the construction site, some comrades were worried that students going to the construction site would affect their studies, but practice has also proved that it not only does not affect learning, but also improves the quality of teaching. In this construction site service work, we took a vivid socialist course through vivid facts and great engineering construction. Whether it is art workers or young people who have just studied art, they generally feel that they have improved in all aspects, especially in ideological awareness. When seeing the 220,000 troops of Weishan fighting day and night, creating an unprecedented miracle, who would not marvel at the wise leadership of the Party and the unparalleled wisdom of the people! When seeing that in only fourteen days, a 366-meter-long dam was built on the surging Yellow River, cutting off the Yellow Dragon and ending its history of harming the people for many years, how can people not see the brilliance of the general line of socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical results! When seeing that in the serious disaster of the summer of 1959, the Xiawei Commune, which had not seen a drop of rain for 53 days, still guaranteed a bumper harvest, how can people not believe in the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune? It is no wonder that the comrades in the Literary and Art Service Team were so reluctant to leave each time they finished their work and returned to the province. Many people repeatedly asked the leaders: next time when organizing the Literary and Art Service Team, don't forget me.

    In the several months of intense construction site life, we have further understanding of the Party's literary and artistic policy, our socialist awareness has been improved, our thoughts and feelings have been transformed, and thus we have also achieved a bumper harvest in art creation. The fiery struggle life excites everyone's heart and greatly stimulates everyone's creative enthusiasm. Everyone feels that their hands have become more agile and their skills have been improved. Not long ago, some works were not appreciated by people, but now they have a wide audience; not long ago, comrades who were still at the downstream of creation have now leaped to the upstream in this construction site creation; not long ago, some people's works were criticized for uglifying the working people and distorting life, but through this in-depth life and familiar life, the image has been beautified, and the expression of life is much more profound.

    "Serving on the construction site for a month is better than creating behind closed doors at home for several years." This is our experience summary after this time going to the water conservancy construction site. This does not only refer to the quantity of creation, but more importantly, the harvest in creative thinking and creative methods. During the one month of service, our thirty-plus people (art cadres, teachers, students) created more than a thousand works on the spot. In these creations, not only the quantity increased, but also the quality improved. These works were all created in a short period of service, such as completing the "Three Parts of Cutting off the Yellow River" group of paintings of the Weishan key project construction site in a week, and completing the historical paintings of the Xiawei Commune "Turning Poor Mountains and Bad Waters into a Land of Rice and Grain" in half a month. Because of the short time, some works are still relatively rough, but they are full of strong life atmosphere, reflecting the revolutionary spirit of the masses working enthusiastically, reflecting the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. What is more worth mentioning is that the majority of the service participants are young students, some of whom have only studied for one or two years. In this case, if it were not for the brilliance of the Party's literary and artistic policy, but creating behind closed doors, it would be impossible to have such great achievements.

    The harvest of creation is also reflected in the fact that many painters, after going deep into life, not only have a profound characterization of characters, but also have a change in style. For example, Tao Tianen's oil painting "Morning of the Yellow River" and Zhang Zhenzhao's watercolor "Wish Comes True" not only profoundly portray the characters' personalities, but also have a more mass style. What is particularly worth mentioning here is that some comrades did not like New Year pictures not long ago, especially woodcut New Year pictures, mistakenly believing that woodcut New Year pictures were "cheap goods" and "products of underdeveloped material conditions"; some people also hated paper-cutting, saying that paper-cutting was "women's playthings." However, through this creation and the test in front of the masses, after understanding the relationship between art and the masses, personal preferences have changed. Many comrades began to learn from folk art forms and created many paper-cuts and Weifang woodcut New Year pictures. For example, the paper-cut of "Cutting off the Yellow River and Locking the Dragon" and the New Year picture "Carp in the Lake Going up the Mountain" are vivid examples.

    In short, through these few construction site service works, we deeply understand that it is not only the fundamental way to transform thinking for literary and art workers to go to factories, go to the countryside, and combine with the working people, but also an effective way to prosper creation, which is a true principle.

    一个月胜过几年
    ——参加工地文艺服务工作的一点体会
    迟宾
    我们一些美术工作者，在参加山东省文化局和省文联组织的文艺服务团的工作中，许多同志在思想上和创作上都有很大的提高。
    首先，我们深深地体会到：美术只有为政治为生产服务，才能发射出光芒。但是如何与生产劳动结合，用美术创作直接为生产服务，我们并不是一开始就很明确的。我们刚到工地的时候，不少同志还存在着这样的思想：服务与创作是否矛盾？有的同志甚至为了搞创作就不愿做工地的美术宣传和美术辅导工作。但经过事实证明，搞美术宣传和美术辅导工作和创作不但不矛盾，而且美术宣传和辅导工作，还大大地丰富和推动了创作，使创作更加具有生命力。当我们初到位山的时候，正值位山的枢纽工程“截流”，迫使猖獗不羁的黄水顺着人们的意志改道而行的第三期工程，也是整个位山的主体工程。这时工地的党委的主要宣传任务，是鼓动起千百万个民工，树雄心立大志，斩断黄水锁住蛟龙。我们在这样的情况下，拿起画具，深入到各个作战的基层单位中去，同工地的工作人员住在一起，共同搞宣传工作。我们把各种政治口号画成宣传画贴在宣传棚里，把不断涌现出的英雄人物和事迹画成肖像画和连环画贴在工地的比武台上。与此同时，我们对一些错误的思想用漫画形式进行批评，把工地的火热斗争状况画成速写、国画和水彩画等等，及时地展出在宣传棚里。我们还开了“腰斩黄河写生画展”和布置过社会主义教育展览会，都受到了群众的热烈欢迎。这样一来，美术武器大大地发挥了鼓舞劳动热情的作用，激发先进人物更先进，后进人物赶先进。我们的创作，不仅得到民工同志们的喜爱，鼓动他们的劳动热情，促进了工程的进展，而且对于我们自己也是一次深刻的教育。
    通过工地生活，我们深深体会到教育唯有与生产劳动相结合，才能有声有色。“工地一个月，胜读十年书”，这是我们许多人的共同体会。在到工地之前，我们有的同志担心着学生下到工地会不会影响学习，但经过实践也证明了它不但不影响学习，反而提高了教学质量。我们在这次工地服务工作当中，通过生动的事实和伟大的工程建设使我们上了一次活的社会主义课程。不论是美术工作者，或是刚刚学习美术不久的青年，都普遍地感到自己在各方面都有提高，特别是在思想觉悟方面有很大提高。当看到位山二十二万大军的昼夜奋战，创造出史无前例的举世奇迹时，谁会不惊叹党的英明领导和人民群众的无比智慧！当看到仅以十四天的时间，就在汹涌澎湃的黄河上，修起了长达三百六十六米的大坝，把黄龙斩断，结束了它为害多年的历史时，人们又怎会看不到社会主义总路线的多、快、好、省的光芒！当看到在1959年的夏天的严重灾害的情况下，曾有五十三天没落一点雨的下位公社仍然保证了丰收时，又怎么叫人不信服人民公社的无比优越性呢？这就难怪文艺服务团在每次结束工作回省时，同志们又是那样难舍难离。有不少人再三向领导要求说：下次再组织文艺服务团时，千万不要忘了我。
    在几个月的紧张工地生活中，我们对党的文艺方针有了进一步的认识，社会主义的觉悟提高了，思想感情转变了，因而在美术创作方面也获得了丰收。火热的斗争生活激动着每个人的心，也大大地激发了每个人的创作热情。大家都觉得自己的手变得灵巧了，技术提高了。不久前有的作品还不被人欣赏，但现在却有了广大的观众；不久前在创作上还居下游的同志，在这次工地的创作中，却一跃而居上游了；在不久前有的人的作品还被人指责丑化劳动人民，歪曲生活，但通过这次深入生活和熟悉生活的结果，形象美化了，表现生活也深刻多了。
    “工地服务一个月，胜过在家关门创作几整年。”这是我们这次到水利工地后的经验总结。这不只是指创作的数量，更重要的还是在创作思想和创作方法的收获。服务的一个月当中，我们三十多人（美术干部、教师、学生）当场创作了一千件以上的作品。在这些创作中，不但数量增加，而且质量也提高了。这些作品都是在短短的服务期中所作成的，如一周时间完成了位山枢纽工程工地组画《腰斩黄河三部曲》，半月时间完成了下位公社史画《穷山恶水变成米粮川》等。因为时间短促，有些作品还比较粗糙，但是却富有浓厚的生活气息，反映出了群众的热火朝天的革命干劲的精神面貌，反映了大跃进的时代精神。更值得提出的是，参加服务工作的有多数还是青年学生，有的只学过一两年的时间，在这样的情况下，如果不是党的文艺方针的光芒照耀，而是关门创作，那就决不可能有这样大的成绩。
    创作的丰收还表现在有不少画家，在深入生活后不仅人物形象刻划深刻了，而且风格也有改变。例如陶田恩的油画《黄河之晨》和张镇照的水彩《愿望实现了》，不但深刻地刻划了人物性格，而且风格也更群众化了。这里特别提出的是，有的同志在不久以前不喜欢年画，尤其是木版年画，错误地认为木版年画是“下贱品”，是“物质条件不发达的产物”；也有的人讨厌剪纸，说剪纸是“妇女们的玩意儿”。但是通过这次创作和在群众面前的考验，理解到艺术同群众的关系之后，个人的喜爱变了。有不少同志开始向民间艺术形式学习，创作了不少剪纸和潍坊的木版年画。如《腰斩黄河锁住蛟龙》的剪纸和年画《湖中鲤鱼上山来》就是鲜明的例证。
    总之，通过这几次工地服务工作，使我们深深地理解到文艺工作者的下厂、下乡和劳动人民相结合，不但是改造思想的根本途径，而且是繁荣创作的有效办法，这是千真万确的原则。
