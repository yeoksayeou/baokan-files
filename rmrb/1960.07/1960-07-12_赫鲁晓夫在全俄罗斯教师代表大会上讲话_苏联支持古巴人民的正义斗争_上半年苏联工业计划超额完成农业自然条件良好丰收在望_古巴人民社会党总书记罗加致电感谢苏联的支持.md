Xinhua News Agency, 11th July, Moscow Dispatch: TASS Moscow reported: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said at the All-Russian Teachers' Congress held in the Kremlin on the 9th that the United States is now obviously plotting sinful steps in a conspiracy against the Cuban people. He said, "We are using all our strength to support Cuba, to support the heroic Cuban people in their struggle for freedom and national independence." Khrushchev also condemned the economic blockade of Cuba by the United States monopoly groups.

He pointed out that "socialist countries and all peace-loving people support the just struggle of the Cuban people. No one can defeat the Cuban people."

He emphasized: "It should not be forgotten that the United States is not as far away from the Soviet Union as it used to be." He said, "If necessary, Soviet gunners can support the Cuban people with their rocket firepower if the aggressive forces of the Pentagon dare to launch an intervention against Cuba. The people in the Pentagon should not forget that, as recent tests have shown, we have rockets that can accurately hit predetermined areas 13,000 kilometers away. If desired, this is a warning to those who want to solve international problems with force instead of reason."

Khrushchev recounted his state visit to Austria. Khrushchev pointed out that this would help to better understand each other and strengthen relations between the two countries. Khrushchev expressed the hope that the agreements reached during his visit would promote further improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Austria. He pointed out that Austrian business circles are very interested in developing trade with the Soviet Union.

When Khrushchev talked about the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, he said, "Our affairs are going very well."

He pointed out that all sectors of the Soviet national economy are thriving, and the second year of the Seven-Year Plan is being victoriously implemented. The plan for the first half of this year has been overfulfilled by 4%. Compared with the first half of last year, industrial output has increased by 10%. Plans to increase labor productivity and reduce costs in industry and construction have also been overfulfilled.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's crop area this year is over 200.2 million hectares. The natural conditions are good now, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

Khrushchev then said that compared with last year, the number of cattle in the Soviet Union has increased by more than 6 million, and meat production has increased by 19%.

Khrushchev said, "We are now solving two historical tasks: establishing the material and technical base of communism and educating new people. In essence, this is a unified process. If we lag behind in the education of Soviet people, then the entire communist cause will inevitably be hindered. Therefore, when formulating a program for carrying out communist construction, the Party and the government are very concerned about strengthening the connection between schools and life and further developing national education."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 10th July: The General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, Blas Roca, sent a telegram to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, yesterday, expressing his gratitude for his speech on the 9th in support of the Cuban revolution. At the All-Russian Teachers' Congress held on the 9th, Khrushchev condemned the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and trying to suffocate Cuba with an economic blockade. Khrushchev also stated that the Soviet Union would do everything possible to support the just struggle of the Cuban people.

Roca's telegram to Khrushchev said, "We gratefully pay our respects to you for giving a speech supporting our country at a time when the Pentagon imperialists, driven mad by the development of Cuba, may launch a foolish armed aggression against Cuba. We are certain that in our decisive moment, we will not lack the most comprehensive assistance from the mighty Soviet Union. Long live proletarian internationalism, the cornerstone of the Soviet Union!"

This telegram was published in the "Hoy" newspaper on the 10th.

　　赫鲁晓夫在全俄罗斯教师代表大会上讲话
　　苏联支持古巴人民的正义斗争
　　上半年苏联工业计划超额完成农业自然条件良好丰收在望
　　古巴人民社会党总书记罗加致电感谢苏联的支持
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9日在克里姆林宫举行的全俄罗斯教师代表大会上讲话时说，美国现在显然正在对古巴人民策划着阴谋的罪恶步骤。他说：“我们正在利用一切力量来支持古巴，支持英勇的古巴人民为自由和民族独立而进行的斗争。”赫鲁晓夫还谴责了美国垄断集团对古巴的经济封锁。
    他指出，“社会主义国家和一切站在和平立场上的人民都支持古巴人民的正义斗争。任何人都不能打败古巴人民。”
    他着重说：“不应当忘记，现在美国不像过去那样对苏联远不可及了。”他说，“在必要时，苏联的炮手可以用自己的火箭火力支持古巴人民，如果五角大楼的侵略势力胆敢对古巴发动干涉的话。五角大楼的人们不要忘记，如最近的试验所表明，我们拥有能够准确地落在一万三千公里之外的预定地区的火箭。如果愿意的话，这就是对那些想用武力，而不想用理智来解决国际问题的人们的警告。”
    赫鲁晓夫讲述了他在奥地利进行的国事访问。赫鲁晓夫指出，这将有助于彼此更好的谅解和加强两国之间的关系。赫鲁晓夫表示希望，在他访问期间所达成的协议将会促使苏联和奥地利的关系进一步改善。他指出，奥地利实业界人士，对发展同苏联的贸易很感兴趣。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联国内情况时说，“我们的事情进行得很好。”
    他指出，苏联国民经济的一切部门都在蒸蒸日上，七年计划第二年的计划正在胜利地执行。今年上半年的计划已超额4％完成。同去年上半年相比，工业产值增加了10％。在工业和建筑业中提高劳动生产率和降低成本的计划也已超额完成。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联今年农作物播种面积在二亿零二百万公顷以上。现在自然条件良好，丰收在望。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，同去年相比，苏联牛的头数增加了六百多万头，肉类的生产增加了19％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们现在正在解决两个历史任务：建立共产主义物质技术基础和教育新人。实质上，这是一个统一的过程。如果我们在苏联人的教育方面落后，那么，整个共产主义事业必然受到阻碍。因此，党和政府在制定为开展共产主义建设的纲领时，非常关心加强学校同生活的联系以及进一步发展国民教育。”
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加昨日打电报给苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，对他在9日发表的关于支持古巴革命的谈话表示谢意。赫鲁晓夫在9日举行的全俄罗斯教师代表大会上曾谴责美国干涉其他国家内政，想用经济封锁来窒息古巴。赫鲁晓夫并且表示，苏联将尽一切努力来支持古巴人民的正义斗争。
    罗加给赫鲁晓夫的电报说，“当由于对古巴的发展而疯狂了的五角大楼帝国主义者可能发动对古巴的愚蠢的武装侵略时，您发表了关于支持我国的谈话，我们对此感激地表示敬意。我们确信，在我们决定性的时刻里，我们不会缺少强大的苏联的最全面的援助。作为苏联的基石的无产阶级国际主义万岁！”
    这个电报发表在10日的“今日报”上。
