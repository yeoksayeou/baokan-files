    Soviet Government's Note to the Government of the People's Republic of China
    --June 27, 1960--
    The Soviet Government considers it its duty to call the attention of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the obviously unsatisfactory situation that has arisen in the disarmament negotiations. These negotiations have been conducted in the Ten-Nation Committee in recent months in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Government has appealed to the governments of all countries on this issue, because the Soviet Government realizes that disarmament is the most urgent and primary issue facing all countries, whether they are large or small, anywhere in the world, and also realizes that the continuation of the arms race will ultimately lead to tragic consequences for all mankind.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China knows that last September, the Soviet Union put forward a disarmament plan in the United Nations; the realization of this plan would mean eliminating all means of waging war, thereby ensuring the consolidation of world peace.
    After considering the Soviet proposals, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on November 20, 1959, calling upon governments to exert every effort to seek a constructive solution to the issue of complete and thorough disarmament. This gave reason to hope that concrete results would finally be achieved in the cause of disarmament.
    It must be emphasized that the Soviet Union not only put forward a plan that pointed out a clear path to a thorough solution of the disarmament issue, but also made significant practical contributions to the cause of disarmament. Without waiting for the signing of an international disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union, at the beginning of 1960, adopted a decision to unilaterally and substantially reduce its armed forces by one-third again. This decision is currently being implemented. In this way, the Soviet Union has done everything it could to create good preconditions for promoting the realization of the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on disarmament and for the Ten-Nation Committee to conduct effective negotiations.
  However, regrettably, the negotiations of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee have failed to live up to the hopes placed in it by the people of all countries. What is the reason for this situation?
    As the entire course of the negotiations has shown, the reason lies in the unwillingness of the United States Government and other Western governments acting in concert with the United States to reach agreement on any realistic measures related to disarmament. On the contrary, they forced the committee to discuss their proposals regarding supervision and inspection without disarmament. Thus, what the Western countries participating in the Ten-Nation Committee sought was not disarmament under international supervision, as suggested by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but supervision of armaments. It should be known that any supervision of armaments can be carried out, however, the threat of war will not be reduced in the slightest as a result. Moreover, supervision of armaments will only increase the sense of fear between countries and sharpen relations between them. Supervision without disarmament is reconnaissance and espionage, which no government concerned with safeguarding the security interests of its own people can agree to. After voting in favor of the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on complete and thorough disarmament in November 1959, the Western countries, in the Ten-Nation Committee, actually tried to emasculate and bury this resolution of the United Nations.
    The position taken by the representatives of the United States and other Western countries in the Ten-Nation Committee clearly shows that if these countries—members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—also want to achieve certain practical results through disarmament negotiations, then this can only be a result that provides unilateral military benefits to them and the military blocs they lead. Otherwise, how should one assess the fact that the United States is particularly insistent on establishing supervision over weapons in which the Soviet Union has a recognized advantage—military space rockets—while at the same time, they are unwilling to even listen to the issue of abolishing the military bases they have established near the borders of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. This utterly subjective and obviously malicious attitude cannot but create new obstacles to reaching a disarmament agreement.
    In order to seek a turning point in the cause of resolving the disarmament issue, the Soviet Government developed the plan it put forward at the United Nations General Assembly in September 1959 and prepared new proposals on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament for the Paris summit meeting.
    The Soviet Union accommodated the wishes of the Western countries on a series of important issues, in particular, it fully considered France's hope to first prohibit and destroy the means of delivering nuclear weapons. Despite the Soviet Union's advantage in the newest and most effective means of delivering nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union still declared its willingness to prohibit and destroy all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets in the first stage of disarmament, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, and at the same time establish corresponding international supervision.
    The Soviet Union has always advocated taking immediate measures aimed at eliminating the threat of rocket-nuclear war. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Government proposed destroying all means of delivering atomic and hydrogen weapons without exception, while simultaneously abolishing military bases on foreign territories and withdrawing foreign troops from these territories. The realization of these measures would effectively make an atomic attack impossible.
    However, after the Soviet Union put forward the proposal to destroy all means of delivering nuclear weapons, the Western participants in the Ten-Nation Committee retreated.
    The situation regarding the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments is no better. For example, when the Soviet Union proposed reducing and eliminating armed forces and conventional armaments in the first and second stages of the disarmament plan, the Western countries objected. Taking into account the Western countries' own wishes, the Soviet Union, in its new proposals, proposed moving this measure to the second and third stages of the complete and thorough disarmament plan. But the Western countries opposed this proposal again.
    In order to accommodate the wishes of the Western countries, the Soviet Union, in its new proposals, elaborated in detail its willingness to organize effective international supervision over disarmament measures. The Soviet Government also considered the opinions of the Soviet Union's negotiating counterparts regarding measures to maintain peace and security under conditions of complete and thorough disarmament.
    After the holding of the summit meeting was made impossible due to the fault of the United States Government, the new proposals on disarmament issued by the Soviet Union to the governments of various countries on June 2 received the widest support in the world. This proposal received the full support of the governments of all socialist countries. This proposal has also been treated positively by the governments of many other countries, as evidenced by the replies of the heads of government of these countries to the letter of N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, of June 2 this year. All sectors of society in all countries, including Western countries, view the new initiatives of the Soviet Government as another proof of the Soviet Union's efforts to seek a way to reach a disarmament agreement, and as a new, important, and constructive step that can lead to a mutually acceptable solution to the disarmament issue.
    So how did the Western countries participating in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee treat the Soviet Union's new proposals?
    The United States and other Western countries not only did not accommodate the Soviet Union's position in the slightest, but also tried to evade substantive discussions of the Soviet Union's new proposals. And the Soviet Union's new proposals extensively considered the wishes of the Western countries themselves. Not only that, but while indefinitely delaying and refusing to discuss the substance of the disarmament issue, they openly adopted a policy of undermining the negotiations of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.
    The working practice of the Ten-Nation Committee shows that the United States and other Western countries participating in the negotiations of this body are obviously unwilling to prohibit and destroy nuclear weapons, eliminate armies, or abolish military bases on foreign territories.
    Thus, the position of the Western countries inevitably prevents the work of the Ten-Nation Committee from achieving any results.
    In this situation, N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, wrote in a personal capacity to the heads of government of the five countries of Great Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Canada, calling on them to study the situation that has arisen in the Ten-Nation Committee with the utmost seriousness. The head of the Soviet Government drew the attention of the governments of the aforementioned countries to the intolerable situation that has arisen, namely, that the committee, which is authorized to study the most important and urgent issues in modern international relations, has been stagnating for a long time and cannot resolve any practical issues of disarmament.
    The Western countries, primarily the United States, while talking about disarmament in the Ten-Nation Committee, have repeatedly devoted themselves to intensifying the arms race, signing new military treaties, and strengthening the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and other aggressive military blocs. These actions very clearly show that the position of the Western members of the Ten-Nation Committee has in fact succumbed to the tasks of the United States' aggressive foreign policy line, which is particularly manifested in raising the intrusion into the airspace of other countries to the level of national policy.
    It is quite natural that the Soviet Government cannot allow the Soviet Union's participation in the Ten-Nation Committee to become a cover for concealing the true actions of the Western countries, which have nothing in common with disarmament, while the Soviet Union's sincere desire for disarmament is well known.
    The Soviet Union and other socialist countries participating in the Ten-Nation Committee are faced with the fact that the Western countries participating in this committee are clearly unwilling to conduct serious negotiations on the issue of disarmament and resolve the issue of disarmament. This raises a natural question: can it be allowed to use negotiations on an issue of such importance to the people of all countries as disarmament, or rather, to use the pretense of such negotiations as a cover for the policies of war preparation and intensification of the arms race pursued by certain Western militarist groups. The Soviet Government cannot tolerate the Ten-Nation Committee being used for this purpose, because tolerating this would be tantamount to participating in deceiving the people. Therefore, the Soviet Government has ceased to participate in the futile debates of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee and has requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to submit the issue of disarmament and the issue of the situation that has arisen in the process of implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 20, 1959, on this issue to the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.
    The Soviet Union has been, and still is, a consistent advocate of disarmament negotiations between countries, and it will continue to be prepared to participate in negotiations in the future. However, it advocates conducting negotiations that can promote serious and effective consideration of the disarmament issue, rather than meaningless debates.
    The Soviet Union still believes that the equal representation of socialist and Western countries in the negotiations is a factor that helps to smoothly consider the disarmament issue. At the same time, the issue of absorbing certain other countries into the negotiations, in addition to the countries participating in the Ten-Nation Committee, for the sake of the cause, has also arisen.
    The Soviet Government expresses the hope that the discussion of the disarmament issue at the next United Nations General Assembly, that is, in the meeting hall where the resolution on complete and thorough disarmament was adopted, will promote the ultimate realization of the lofty ideal of disarmament into a concrete reality.
    The issue of disarmament involves the vital interests of the people of all countries, large and small, as well as the vital interests of all countries, regardless of the social relations and ways of life established in these countries. The direction in which the international situation develops—whether it develops towards peace or towards war—will depend on the resolution of this issue. It is precisely for this reason that the vast majority of the people in the world long for disarmament. The Soviet Government is deeply convinced that in our era, disarmament is not only vitally necessary, but also entirely possible, if due efforts can be made in this regard.
    The obstructions and artificial obstacles set up by certain Western countries on the road to disarmament can no longer be tolerated. People all over the world want to live without worrying about their future, and want to get rid of the heavy burden of military spending that is weighing on their shoulders. They have the right to expect that the governments of various countries can find ways to meet these aspirations of the people of various countries.
    As for the Soviet Government, it will not weaken its efforts to promote the cessation of the arms race and to free humanity from the threat of devastating war forever.
    The Soviet Government hopes that the Government of the People's Republic of China will give due attention to the opinions expressed in this note and will assist in the great and humanitarian cause of disarmament.

    苏联政府致中华人民共和国政府的照会
    ——1960年6月27日——
    苏联政府认为有责提请中华人民共和国政府注意裁军谈判中所形成的显然令人不能满意的状况。这个谈判是近几个月来根据联合国大会的决议于十国委员会中举行的。苏联政府就这一问题向世界各国政府发出呼吁，因为苏联政府意识到裁军是摆在世界各国——无论是处于世界任何地方的大国或小国面前的最迫切的和最主要的问题，并且也意识到继续进行军备竞赛最终将会导致全体人类的悲惨后果。
    中华人民共和国政府知道，去年9月，苏联在联合国提出了裁军计划；这一计划的实现，将意味着消除进行战争的一切手段，从而将会确保巩固的世界和平。
    在审议了苏联的建议后，联合国大会于1959年11月20日一致通过了一项决议，吁请各国政府竭尽全力谋求就全面彻底裁军问题达成建设性的解决。这曾使人有理由希望，在裁军的事业中终将取得具体的成果。
    必须强调指出，苏联不仅提出了一个指出了彻底解决裁军问题的明确途径的计划，而且还对裁军事业作出了重大的实际贡献。苏联并没有等到签订国际裁军协定，就于1960年初通过了再次单方面大量裁减本国武装部队三分之一的决定。目前，这一决定正在实施中。这样，苏联就为促使联合国大会关于裁军的决议得到实现和为十国委员会进行有成效的谈判创造良好的前提而做到了它所能作的一切。
  然而，令人遗憾的是，十国裁军委员会的谈判却辜负了各国人民对它所寄予的希望。造成这一情况的原因是什么呢？
    正如谈判的整个过程所表明的那样，原因在于，美国政府和同美国一致行动的其他西方国家政府不愿意就实现有关裁军的任何现实措施达成协议。与此相反，它们强使委员会讨论它们关于没有裁军的监督和视察的建议。这样，参加十国委员会的西方国家所力求的就不是像苏联和其他社会主义国家所建议的那样，在国际监督之下进行裁军，而是对军备进行监督。要知道，对军备可以进行任何的监督，然而，战争的威胁丝毫也不会由此而减少。不仅如此，对军备进行监督只会增加各国之间的疑惧心理并使各国之间的关系尖锐起来。没有裁军的监督，这是侦察和间谍活动，这是任何一个关心保障本国人民安全利益的政府所不能同意的。在1959年11月投票赞成了联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军的决议之后，西方国家在十国委员会中，实际上却尽力阉割和葬送联合国的这一决议。
    美国和其他西方国家代表在十国委员会中所采取的立场十分清楚地表明，如果说这些国家——北大西洋公约组织成员国——也想通过裁军谈判来取得某些实际结果的话，那么，这只能是对他们和他们所领导的军事集团提供单方面的军事利益的结果。否则，对于下面这一事实又当如何估价，比如美国特别坚持要求对苏联占有公认优势的武器——军用的宇宙火箭建立监督，而与此同时，却对取消他们在临近苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的边境所建立的军事基地一事连听都不愿意听。这种毫不客观的和显然恶劣的态度不能不对达成裁军协议造成新的障碍。
    为了在解决裁军问题的事业中求得转折，苏联政府发展了它于1959年9月在联合国大会上提出的计划，并为巴黎高级会议准备了关于全面彻底裁军问题的新建议。
    苏联在一系列重要问题上迎合了西方国家的意愿，特别是完全考虑了法国关于首先禁止和销毁核武器运载工具的希望。尽管苏联在最新和最有效的核武器运载工具方面占有优势，苏联仍然声明它愿意在裁军的第一阶段就禁止和销毁运载核武器到达目标的一切工具，其中也包括洲际弹道火箭，并同时建立相应的国际监督。
    苏联一向主张立即采取旨在消除火箭—核战争的威胁的措施。正因为这样，苏联政府才提出了无例外地销毁原子和氢武器的一切运载工具，同时取消在外国领土上的军事基地，并从这些领土撤退外国军队。这些措施的实现，实际上就会使得原子进攻成为不可能。
    但是，在苏联提出了关于销毁一切核武器运载工具的建议之后，十国委员会的西方参加国就后退了。
    关于裁减武装部队和常规军备的情况也并不比这好些。例如，当苏联建议在裁军计划的第一和第二阶段裁减和取消武装部队和常规军备时，西方国家表示反对。考虑到西方国家自己的愿望，苏联在新建议中提议把这一措施移至全面彻底裁军计划的第二和第三阶段中来实现。但是西方国家又反对了这一建议。
    为了迎合西方国家的愿望，苏联在其新建议中详细地陈述了有关对裁军措施组织有效的国际监督的愿望。苏联政府还考虑了苏联的谈判对方所提出的关于在全面彻底裁军的条件下维护和平和安全的措施的意见。
    由于美国政府的过错而使高级会议的举行成为不可能以后，苏联在6月2日向各国政府发出的关于裁军的新建议，得到了全世界最广泛的支持。这一建议得到了所有社会主义国家政府的完全支持。这一建议也受到了许多其他国家政府的肯定的对待，这些国家政府首脑对苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫今年6月2日信件的答复正说明了这一点。所有各国，包括西方国家在内的社会各界人士把苏联政府的新倡议看成是苏联尽力寻求达成裁军协议的途径的又一个证明，看成是能使裁军问题获致彼此都能接受的解决办法的新的、重要的建设性的步骤。
    那么参加十国裁军委员会的西方国家是如何对待苏联的新建议呢？
    美国和其他西方国家不仅一步也没有迎合苏联的立场，反而竭力回避对苏联的新建议进行实质性的讨论。而苏联的新建议广泛地考虑了西方国家本身的意愿。不但如此，他们在无限期地拖延和拒绝讨论裁军问题实质的同时，公然采取了破坏十国裁军委员会谈判的方针。
    十国委员会的工作实践表明，美国和参加这个机构谈判的其他西方国家显然既不愿意禁止和销毁核武器、消灭军队，也不愿意取消在外国领土上的军事基地。
    这样，西方国家的立场就必然使十国委员会的工作不会获得任何结果。
    在这种情况下，苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫以个人名义写信给英国、法国、美国、意大利和加拿大五国的政府首脑，呼吁他们要以极其认真的态度来研究在十国委员会中所形成的局面。苏联政府首脑提请上述国家政府注意所形成的不可容忍的局面，即被授权研究现代国际关系中最重要和最刻不容缓的问题的委员会，长期以来停滞不前，不能解决任何一个裁军的实际问题。
    西方国家，首先是美国，与在十国委员会中谈论裁军的同时，却一再致力于加紧军备竞赛，签订新的军事条约和强化北大西洋条约组织、东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织和其他侵略性军事集团的活动。这些行动非常明显地说明，十国委员会的西方成员国的立场，实际上已屈从于美国的侵略性的对外政策方针的任务，这种侵略性的对外政策方针特别表现在把侵入他国的领空提高到国策的水平上。
    十分自然，苏联政府不能让苏联参加十国委员会一事变成向各国人民掩盖西方国家同裁军毫无共同之处的真实行动的幌子，而苏联对裁军的真诚愿望是众所周知的。
    苏联和参加十国委员会的其他社会主义国家面临这一事实：参加这一委员会的西方国家显然不愿意就裁军问题进行认真的谈判并解决裁军问题。这就产生了一个自然的问题：能否允许利用关于裁军这样一个对各国人民如此重要的问题的谈判，更确切地说，利用这种谈判的假象作幌子，来掩盖某些西方国家的军国主义集团奉行的备战政策和加紧军备竞赛的政策。苏联政府不能容忍十国委员会被用于这种目的，因为容忍这一点，就等于参与欺骗人民。因此，苏联政府已停止参加十国裁军委员会徒劳无益的争论，并请求联合国秘书长把裁军问题及在执行联合国大会1959年11月20日关于这个问题的决议过程中所形成的局势的问题提交联合国大会例会讨论。
    苏联过去是，现在仍然是各国之间进行裁军谈判的一贯的拥护者，它今后仍将准备参加谈判。但是，它主张进行能够促进认真的和有成效的审议裁军问题的谈判，而不是无谓的辩论。
    苏联仍然认为，社会主义国家和西方国家代表在谈判中的对等代表制是有助于顺利审议裁军问题的因素。同时也产生了除参加十国委员会的国家以外，为了事业的利益，吸收某些其他国家参加谈判的问题。
    苏联政府表示希望，在下届联合国大会上，即在曾经通过了关于全面彻底裁军决议的会议厅里对裁军问题进行讨论，将促使裁军的崇高思想最终成为具体现实。
    裁军问题涉及到大小各国人民的切身利益，以及各个国家的切身利益，不管这些国家所确立的社会关系和生活方式如何。国际局势朝着那个方向发展——是朝着和平还是朝着战争发展，将取决于这一问题的解决。正是因为这样，世界绝大多数人民才都渴望裁军。苏联政府深信，在我们的时代里，裁军不仅是切身必需的，而且也是完全可能的，如果对此能够作出应有的努力的话。
    对于某些西方国家在裁军的道路上所设置的阻挠和人为的障碍再也不能容忍。全世界的人们都希望在不为自己未来担忧的情况下生活，希望摆脱压在自己肩上的沉重的军费负担。他们有权期待各国政府能够找到满足各国人民这些愿望的途径。
    至于苏联政府，那么它将不减弱自己的努力，以促进停止军备竞赛和使人类永远摆脱毁灭性战争的威胁。
    苏联政府希望，中华人民共和国政府对本照会中所表示的意见会给予应有的注意并对裁军这一伟大和人道的事业给予协助。
