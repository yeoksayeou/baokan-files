A small story about supporting agriculture:

    Friendship Flows Forever
    Liu Ji, Bu Huapeng, Sian People's Commune, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province

    A canal stretches forward, its water flowing across the fields, where sturdy seedlings sway gently. Teams of commune members weed and till in the jade-green fields. Women sing at the top of their voices:

    The canal flows long, our friendship is deep,
    Factory and commune are linked, a joyful thing to keep,
    Sending us water pumps, helping us in our farming,
    Autumn harvest fills the ground, transporting grain to the factory.

    If you ask about the origin of this song, like water has a source and a tree has roots, it's a long story:

    In March of this year, the Nantong City "July 1st Farm Machinery Factory" and the Nantong County Sian People's Commune were linked to support each other. Some commune members understood "worker-peasant alliance, joint great leap forward," but for a time they couldn't specifically say the benefits and significance of the factory-commune linkage.

    In May, wheat was harvested, mid-season rice was transplanted, corn was cultivated, and cotton was managed, with many farm tasks. Commune members fought in the fields, running with thumping steps, carrying loads in a puff of smoke, racing against time, not yielding an inch of land.

    Hunters aren't afraid of many pheasants, and farmers aren't afraid of heavy farm work. This year, Nantong County's three wheat crops and two bean crops, along with safflower, soared to the sky, with yields exceeding those of Yangzhou, winning the overall championship. Everyone was overjoyed, and the members of the 19th team were even happier. They built an irrigation canal within the area of 2,000 acres of farmland and used a water pump for the first time. The machine was running day and night, its water churning and flowing. In the past, it was "rice is delicious but water is hard to wheel," but now it's "dig canals to draw water to irrigate the fields." The commune members laughed heartily, adding strength to their whole bodies. Who would have thought that one night, the water disappeared from the canal, the machine stopped running, and the rice fields were like lambs seeking milk, waiting for water to irrigate them. The commune members were anxious and busy, setting up waterwheels one after another. But dozens of waterwheels, hundreds of laborers, no matter how fast the waterwheels turned, couldn't match the rushing water of the pump. Wouldn't you be anxious, wouldn't you be worried?!

    The commune's Party committee immediately called, inviting the July 1st Factory to send repair technicians to inspect the machine. The next day, the best repair technicians from the July 1st Farm Machinery Factory rushed thirty *li* and arrived before dawn. Upon inspection, a part was broken, and to repair it for use would take at least ten days.

    Ten days, what a long time! Seeing the dry fields unable to be watered or planted, the commune members' mouths were pursed high; the machine operators circled the machine; the cadres stayed up all night, racking their brains. So many laborers were tied up on the waterwheels, so many farm tasks were waiting to be done, truly everyone's heart was burning like fire.

    Unexpectedly, the next night, the pumping station resounded again with the sound of the motor, and long streams of water appeared in the canal, as if cool oil was flowing into the fields. The commune members crowded around a 60-horsepower machine, listening to the branch secretary's introduction, their eyes filled with tears of excitement. Old and young ran to tell each other: The worker elder brothers didn't wait for us to ask to borrow it, but sent us a water pump, and what's more, they took it out of their busy schedule, what great spirit, what deep friendship!

    Water flows everywhere, an endless flow of the water of friendship. Endless affection. The commune members opened their throats, singing and responding to each other: The canal flows long, our friendship is deep... The machine drummed, the water flowed in accompaniment, the singing was loud, echoing in the fields, stirring the heart.

    Even now, this brand-new 60-horsepower diesel engine, a symbol of friendship, drives the water pump day and night, churning and flying, the water column from the nozzle shooting like a pillar, the waves surging, flowing from the canal to the rice fields, irrigating the seedlings green as jade, strong as a forest, standing tall in the fields, presaging a bumper year.

### 友谊水长流

    友谊水长流
    江苏南通县四安人民公社　刘继　卜华鹏
    一条渠道，延伸向前，渠内流水漫遍田间，茁壮的秧苗，频频摇曳。一队队的社员，在碧玉般的田野里拔草耘耥。妇女们引吭高歌：
    渠道长流水哟，友谊深又长，
    厂社挂了钩哟，美事记心上，
    送来抽水机哟，帮我农时忙，
    秋收谷上场哟，运粮进工厂。
    要问这首歌的由来，水有源，树有根，说来话长：
    今年3月份，南通市“七一农机厂”与南通县四安人民公社挂钩，互相支持。有些社员虽懂得“工农联盟，共同跃进”，但一时还不会具体地说出厂社挂钩的好处和意义来。
    5月里，割麦收麦，移栽中稻，培植玉米，管理棉花，农活多了。社员们奋战田间，跑路咚咚响，挑担一溜烟，争分夺秒，寸土不让。
    打猎的不怕山鸡多，种田的不怕农活重。今年南通县三麦二豆红花飞上了天，产量超过了扬中，夺得了全面冠军，谁不欢欣鼓舞，而第十九队的社员们更是喜上添喜。他们在二千亩农田范围内筑起了灌溉渠，第一次使用了抽水机。机器开动，日夜不息，水花翻滚，滔滔长流。过去是“米饭好吃水难车”，如今是“开渠引水灌田庄”。社员乐得呵呵笑，浑身上下把劲添。谁想到，一天夜里，渠道里不见了流水，机器停止了转动，一块块稻田如羔羊求乳，待水灌田。社员们又急又忙，架水车一个接一个。但几十部水车，几百个劳力，任凭水车踏得飞转，怎抵得上抽水机流水哗哗，你说急人不急人，心焦不心焦！？
    公社党委立即打电话，邀请七一厂派修理技师来检修机器。第二天，七一农机厂派来的最好的修理技师急行三十里，拂晓前赶到。一检修，机件坏了，要修复使用，最少要十天。
    十天，多长的时间啊！眼看着坂田灌不上水、栽不下秧，社员们嘴巴翘得半天高；机务人员围着机器转；干部熬红了眼，费尽了心。多少劳力在水车上抽不开身，多少农活等人去做，真是人人心里如火烧。
    第二天夜里，出人意料，抽水站重又响起了马达声，渠道里出现了长流水，田野里仿佛流进了清凉油。社员们拥向一架六十马力的机器旁，听着支部书记的介绍，激动得热泪盈眶，老人小孩奔走相告：工人老大哥没有等我们启齿相借，为我们送来了抽水机，而且，这是从百忙中抽出来的呀，多伟大的精神，多深厚的友谊。
    水，流天汪地，流不尽的友谊水啊，话不尽的深情，社员们拉开喉咙东唱西应：渠道长流水哟，友谊深又长……机器击板，流水伴奏，歌声嘹亮，回绕在田野，激动在心境。
    直到现在，这架标志友谊的崭新的六十马力柴油机，日夜带动水泵，翻腾飞舞，水筒口喷水如柱，浪花奔腾，从渠道流向一块块稻田，灌得秧苗碧绿如玉，茁壮似林，巍立田间，预兆丰年。
