Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei is strengthening field management of intermediate rice across the province, actively carrying out "three guarantees" (guarantee seedlings, guarantee ears, guarantee grains) and "five preventions" (prevention of insects, disease, drought, flood, and lodging) to ensure a large-scale, balanced increase in intermediate rice production. Intermediate rice seedlings in Hubei Province are growing well, creating conditions for thick stalks, large ears, and full, heavy grains. However, in this situation, a few people have developed a "settled outcome" mentality, believing that "whether it's a bumper harvest or a poor harvest, the overall situation is set, and there's not much more to manage." In response to this, localities have vigorously promoted the idea of agriculture as the foundation, and have taken measures such as conducting layer-by-layer checks of thinking, leadership depth, labor arrangements, and crop growth to thoroughly break down the "settled outcome" mentality. After criticizing the "settled outcome" mentality, Shishou County immediately transferred more than 570 cadres and 16,000 laborers, implementing a method of dividing areas and assigning responsibilities to individuals to further strengthen the management of intermediate rice. In three days, the Zhuangcheng Management District of the Dongsheng Commune in this county universally top-dressed more than 1,200 mu of third-class seedlings with fertilizer and weeded out barnyard grass in 1,800 mu of fields.

In comprehensively strengthening field management of intermediate rice, leading cadres at all levels in Hubei have gone deep into the front lines of production, to the most difficult places, and to the most backward places, leading the masses to carry out crash programs to eliminate third-class seedlings and to run experimental fields for upgrading backward seedlings. In Xiangyang Prefecture alone, the more than 150,000 team leaders and above have established 300,000 mu of experimental fields for upgrading backward seedlings. Recently, based on the results of seedling inspections and rankings, Zhaoyang County organized 16 county committee members, more than 130 commune party committee members, and more than 5,500 team leaders and above to go deep into backward teams, backward areas, and backward plots to solve specific problems, and launched a large-scale competition throughout the county to have third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings. In Huanggang Prefecture, Macheng County has successively organized more than 1,900 shock teams, led by secretaries at all levels, living in backward areas. In a few days, they carried out a crash program to produce more than 2.2 million jin of green manure, enabling all 43,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the county to be universally top-dressed with fertilizer. Wanggang Commune in Xishui County implemented a method of assigning leading cadres to areas, assigning cultivation tasks to groups, and assigning management responsibilities to individuals, specifying management content and requirements for first, second, and third-class seedlings. Special personnel were assigned to manage the water for the better-growing first-class seedlings, irrigating frequently and shallowly, and drying the fields early to prevent lodging; the second and third-class seedlings were universally weeded and top-dressed with fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou. While concentrating forces on rushing the harvest, Fujian is launching a high tide of rushing to plant and expand planting. The province has already planted more than 13 million mu of autumn-harvest crops such as late rice, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains. It is now continuing to concentrate its forces, striving to complete the summer planting task before the "Start of Autumn."

This year, Fujian Province plans to expand the planting of autumn-harvest crops by about 3 million mu compared to last year. In addition, since mid-to-late June, rainfall has been scarce in various places, and drought conditions have appeared in many areas, making this year's summer planting task even more arduous. In order to plant, manage, and cultivate on time, with quality, and in quantity, all localities have concentrated forces from all aspects to strengthen the front line of rushing to harvest and rushing to plant. In Fuan County, which is severely affected by drought, 1,200 county and commune cadres led 100,000 commune members in a crash program to fight drought and rush to plant, expanding the planted area of late rice and sweet potatoes by 30% compared to the same period last year. The communes in Fuqing County put forward the slogan of competing for water, competing for time, and competing for planting, and carried out large-scale drought-resistant summer planting cooperation, increasing the county's drought-resistant rushing to plant speed to more than 10,000 mu per day. Jinjiang and Zhangpu counties also built more than 4,800 interception and diversion projects, enabling all 85,000 mu of previously drought-affected land to be planted with crops.

In the process of fighting drought, rushing to plant, and expanding planting, various localities have vigorously carried out reforms in farming tools, successively promoting and using tens of thousands of rice transplanters, furrowers, and other farming machines, greatly improving the speed and quality of summer planting. The communes in Qingning County established rice transplanter stations and widely used rice transplanters for transplanting, increasing transplanting efficiency by about 100%, and the dense planting specifications also met requirements.

    湖北各级干部带头大抓中稻弱苗升级
    福建集中劳力力争“立秋”前完成夏种
    据新华社武汉电　湖北各地全面加强对中稻的田间管理，积极开展“三保”（保株、保穗、保粒）、“五防”（即防虫、防病、防旱、防涝、防倒伏）活动，力保中稻大面积平衡增产。湖北省的中稻禾苗生长良好，为秆粗穗大、粒满粒重创造了条件。但在这种情况下，少数人产生了“是丰是歉，大局已定，没有多少管头了”的“定局论”思想。针对这种思想，各地一方面大力宣传以农业为基础的思想，一方面采取层层查思想、查领导深入、查劳力安排和查作物生长情况等办法，大破“定局论”。石首县在批判“定局论”思想后，全县立即抽调五百七十多个干部和一万六千个劳力，实行划片定块、责任到人的办法，进一步加强了对中稻的管理。这个县的东升公社庄城管理区三天时间给一千二百多亩三类苗普遍追了一遍肥，并在一千八百多亩田里除了稗草。
    在全面加强中稻田间管理中，湖北各级领导干部纷纷深入到生产第一线，到最困难的地方，到最落后的地方，领导群众突击消灭三类苗，大办落后苗升级试验田。仅襄阳专区的十五万个小队长以上干部办起的落后苗升级试验田就达三十万亩。枣阳县最近根据禾苗检查排队的情况，全县组织了十六个县委委员，一百三十多个公社党委委员，五千五百多个小队长以上干部，深入到落后队、落后片、落后块去解决具体问题，并在全县开展了三类苗赶一类苗的大竞赛。黄冈地区的麻城县先后组织了一千九百多个突击队，由各级书记带领，住在落后地区，几天时间，突击沤制青肥二百二十多万斤，使全县四万三千多亩三类苗普遍追了一遍肥。浠水县汪岗公社就实行了领导干部定到片，培育任务定到组，管理责任定到人的办法，对一、二、三类苗分别定出管理内容和要求。对生长较好的一类苗固定了专人管水，勤灌浅灌，提早晒田，防止倒伏；对二、三类苗普遍除了一遍草，追了一遍肥。
    据新华社福州电　福建各地在集中力量进行抢收同时，掀起了抢种、扩种生产高潮。全省已经种下晚稻、地瓜和杂粮等秋收作物一千三百多万亩。现正继续集中力量，力争在“立秋”以前完成夏种任务。
    今年福建省计划种植的秋收作物，比去年扩大三百万亩左右，再加各地自6月中、下旬以来降雨量稀少，不少地方出现旱象，使今年夏种任务更加繁重。为了按时按质按量种好管好，各地都集中各方面的力量加强抢收抢种第一线。受旱较严重的福安县，一千二百多名县、社干部，带领十万个社员，突击抗旱抢种，已种的晚稻、地瓜面积比去年同期扩大了30％。福清县各公社提出争水争时争种的口号，开展了抗旱夏种大协作，使全县每天抗旱抢种的速度增加到一万亩以上。晋江、漳浦两县还突击修建了四千八百多处截水、引水工程，使原来受旱的八万五千多亩田地都全部种上作物。
    各地在抗旱抢种扩种中，大搞耕种工具改革，先后推广使用了上十万部插秧机、整畦器等耕作机具，大大提高了夏种速度和质量。清宁县各公社建立插秧机站，广泛使用插秧机插秧，插秧工效提高一倍左右，密植规格化也合要求。
