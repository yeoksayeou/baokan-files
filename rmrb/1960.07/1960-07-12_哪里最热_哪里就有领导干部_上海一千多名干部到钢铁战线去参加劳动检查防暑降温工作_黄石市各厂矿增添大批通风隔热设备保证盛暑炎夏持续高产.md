Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 11th: In recent days, many leading cadres in Shanghai have gone deep into the hottest workshops to participate in labor and inspect heatstroke prevention and cooling work.

These days, the temperature in Shanghai has remained around 36 degrees Celsius, and the temperature in many factory workshops is even higher. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China specially drew more than 1,400 cadres from government offices to support the steel front in mid-June and early July; many district party secretaries led a group of cadres to the high-temperature workshops of factories. After they went down, they ate, lived, and worked with the workers, comprehensively cared for the workers' lives, built large cool sheds for outdoor workers, and solved the accommodation problems for night shift workers. Han Jincao, the first secretary of the Nanshi District Committee, led more than 40 cadres to the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, adding materials, carrying coke, and transporting limestone in the material yard. They did everything, which greatly encouraged the workers.

Since the beginning of summer, party committees at all levels and factories in Shanghai have generally strengthened heatstroke prevention and cooling work in high-temperature workshops. Recently, the Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, the Municipal Labor Bureau, and other departments, as well as various districts, inspected more than 800 factory's high-temperature workshops. The results of the inspection show that factories and enterprises throughout the city have generally grasped heatstroke prevention and cooling work tightly, early, and acted quickly. Due to the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement, this year's heatstroke prevention and cooling work has new characteristics in many factories. For example, after the remote automatic control of the piercing machine in Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory was realized, workers no longer operate around red steel with a temperature of more than 1,000 degrees.

In the process of vigorously grasping heatstroke prevention and cooling work, leading cadres of many factories comprehensively cared for the health of workers, so that workers could get enough sleep and rest well. The Party branch of the Xiejin Foundry mobilized all the workers in the factory to clean up some empty rooms and use them as places for night shift workers to rest. The workers were very grateful for the Party's meticulous care, and their production enthusiasm was high. In early July, they created a new record of high yield and high quality since this year. The daily output of iron castings increased from an average of 6.5 tons in June to 8 tons, and the highest reached 9.5 tons. The quality also remained at a high level.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11th: Factories and mines in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, have added heatstroke prevention and cooling facilities to ensure that workers can do a good job in production during the hot summer.

According to statistics from 40 enterprises including Daye Steel Plant, Huaxin Cement Plant, and Daye Iron Mine, more than 110 major heatstroke prevention and cooling facilities, including new technical mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation, heat insulation equipment, cool sheds, and ice factories, planned to be added this year have been realized.

The Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has studied and deployed heatstroke prevention and cooling this year, and has continuously inspected and supervised it. Each factory and mine has determined a deputy party secretary or deputy factory director to be specifically responsible for this work. The city's financial and trade, health and other departments have taken the initiative to cooperate, and commercial employees have distributed materials for heatstroke prevention and cooling to various factories earlier.

　　哪里最热　哪里就有领导干部
　　上海一千多名干部到钢铁战线去参加劳动检查防暑降温工作
    黄石市各厂矿增添大批通风隔热设备保证盛暑炎夏持续高产
    据新华社上海11日电　近几天来，上海许多领导干部纷纷深入到最热的车间去参加劳动，检查防暑降温工作。
    这几天，上海市的温度一直保持在摄氏三十六度左右，许多工厂的车间温度还要高。中共上海市委在6月中旬和7月初，特地从机关中抽调了一千四百多名干部支援钢铁战线；许多区的区委书记带领一批干部，到工厂的高温车间。他们下去以后，和工人们同吃、同住、同劳动，全面关心工人的生活，替露天作业工人搭起了大凉棚，为夜班工人解决住宿问题。南市区委第一书记韩劲草，带领四十多名干部到上钢三厂，在料场上加料、抬焦炭、运石灰石，样样活都干，给了工人们很大的鼓舞。
    入夏以来，上海市各级党委和各工厂普遍加强了高温车间的防暑降温工作。最近，上海市爱国卫生运动委员会和市劳动局等部门以及各区，对八百多个工厂的高温车间，进行了检查。检查的结果说明，全市工厂企业对防暑降温工作，一般都抓得紧、抓得早，行动迅速。许多工厂由于技术革命运动的深入发展，今年的防暑降温工作有了新的特点。如永鑫无缝钢管厂穿孔机实现遥远自动控制以后，工人们就不再围着一千多度的红钢操作了。
    许多工厂的领导干部在大抓防暑降温工作中，全面关心工人的健康，使工人们睡足歇好。协进翻砂厂党支部发动全厂职工把有些空房打扫得清清爽爽，作为夜班工人休息的地方。职工们对党的这种无微不至的关怀，十分感激，生产热情高涨，7月初创造了今年以来高产优质的新纪录，铸铁件的日产量从6月份平均六点五吨提高到八吨，最高达到了九点五吨，质量也保持了较高的水平。
    据新华社武汉11日电　湖北省黄石市各厂矿企业增添防暑降温设施，保证工人们在炎热的夏季搞好生产。
    据大冶钢厂、华新水泥厂、大冶铁矿等四十个企业的统计，今年规划增添的新技术机械通风、自然通风、隔热设备和凉棚、冰厂等重大防暑降温设施，已经实现了一百一十多项。
    中共黄石市委今年对防暑降温进行了研究和布置，并且不断地检查督促。各厂矿都确定一位党委副书记或副厂长专门负责这项工作。全市财贸、卫生等部门都主动配合，商业职工已提早将防暑降温用的物资分送各厂。（附图片）
