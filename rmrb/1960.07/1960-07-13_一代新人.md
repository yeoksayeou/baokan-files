　　A New Generation
　　Yan Zhen
    Mother Zhang's moon is setting, the night is deep, the lamplight is like a ball of silver, in the shoe-making team, Mother Zhang sits under the lamp, testing a steel needle. White cloth sews out a thousand layers of soles, black cloth embroiders a yuanbao (ingot) vamp, newly made shoes are placed on the table, pair after pair after pair. One pair is sent to the Red Banner bearer, one pair is sent to the clever girl, one pair is sent to the health worker, one pair is sent to the old commune leader… Mother is always a mother at heart, her hands are diligent with flying needles and threads, she stays up all night countless times, annoyed that the morning rooster urges her on so quickly. Don't blame Mother for not resting, Mother is thinking about the Great Leap Forward, the sound of footsteps rings in Mother's heart, walking is the commune's new generation.
  Yin Feng has a abacus in her left hand and a pen in her right, in front of her is a telephone, she does not sleep in the deep of the night, guarding the commune's office. The telephone rings urgently, her heart is surprised and happy, looking at the production progress table, she adds stroke after stroke: the iron factory's targets have been broken through again, the fishing team's records have been refreshed again, there is much news in the production team, wheat yields per mu have exceeded a thousand jin. The paper is full of numbers like pearls, shining brightly in the deep of night, her hands move and her heart also moves: the commune changes to a new scene day and night. Forgetting the hardship and forgetting the tiredness, she works every night until dawn, her hands do not stop and her face is smiling, accompanying a round sun rising.
    Sister Yun's footsteps are very light, the maternity hospital is so quiet, the commune's next generation is born in this silence. The sweat on her forehead is exchanged for the infants' lives, exchanged for the joy of the whole commune, exchanged for the mothers' smiles. She often wishes to listen to the infants' cries in the deep of night, guessing: this one will be a labor hero in the future, that one will definitely be a sports champion. She often wishes to gaze at the infants next to the small beds: this one will be a famous actor in the future, that one will perhaps be an excellent foreman… The older generation often talks to her about old things: from inside the mother's womb there was worry the child would suffer poverty; she sounds somewhat like she doesn't understand, and asks: Is this a real thing?

　　一代新人
　　严阵
    张妈妈月儿偏西夜已深，灯光好似一团银，制鞋组里张妈妈，坐在灯下试钢针。白布纳出千层底，黑布绣出元宝帮，做出新鞋桌上摆，一双一双又一双。一双送给红旗手，一双送给巧姑娘，一双送给保健员，一双送给老社长……妈妈总是妈妈心，飞针走线手儿勤，一夜挑灯无数次，恼那晨鸡催得紧。莫怪妈妈不休息，妈妈想的大跃进，妈妈心上脚步响，走着公社一代人。
  银　凤左手算盘右手笔，眼前一架电话机，更深人静她不睡，守着公社办公室。电话铃声响得急，她的心里惊又喜，对着生产进度表，添上一笔又一笔：铁厂的指标又突破，捕捞队的纪录又刷新，生产队里新闻多，小麦亩产上千斤。满纸数字像珍珠，深更半夜放光明，她的手动心也动：公社日夜换新景。忘了辛苦忘了累，她夜夜工作到黎明，双手不停面带笑，伴着一轮太阳升。
    芸　姐她的脚步很轻，产院里多么安静，公社的下一代，就在这静寂中诞生。她额上的汗珠，换来了婴儿的生命，换来了全社的欢喜，换来了母亲的笑容。她常愿在深夜里，听着婴儿的哭声猜想：这个将来是劳动英雄，那个一定是运动健将。她常愿在小床边，对着婴儿打量：这个是未来的名演员，那个也许是出色的工长……老一辈常对她谈起旧事：娘肚里就耽心孩子受穷；她听起来有些不懂，问道：这是真的事情？
