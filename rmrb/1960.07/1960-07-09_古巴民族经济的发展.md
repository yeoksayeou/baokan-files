The Cuban people, while defending the fruits of their revolution and fighting back against the interventionist conspiracies of U.S. imperialism after overthrowing the U.S. puppet Batista dictatorship, have placed the task of transforming the semi-colonial, semi-feudal economic structure and vigorously developing the national economy in a primary position, and have achieved remarkable success.

At the present stage, Cuba's tasks in developing its economy are mainly: 1. Resolutely implement land reform, establish cooperatives, and develop diversified agricultural operations to change the single-crop system created by the United States. 2. Vigorously develop national industry on the basis of land reform, especially expanding state ownership, economic planning, and state supervision and leadership of the economy, in order to achieve national industrialization and lay the foundation for national independence and economic independence. 3. Expel U.S. economic forces, establish state control over the economy, national resources, and domestic and foreign trade, and develop trade relations with countries around the world, especially with socialist countries, in order to break away from the cruel exploitation and strict control of U.S. monopoly capital. 4. Strengthen financial management, eliminate unemployment, and improve people's livelihoods, in order to change the state of extreme poverty of the Cuban people for generations.

Changing the Single-Crop Economy

The large-scale implementation of land reform and the free distribution of land to farmers to eradicate the semi-feudal latifundia system that hinders the development of productive forces is an important symbol of the in-depth development of the Cuban revolution and a decisive step in Cuba's struggle for independent national economic development.

In Cuba, 1960 was designated as the "Year of Land Reform," meaning that land reform work should be completed this year. Currently, Cuba's land reform work has entered a decisive stage. By May 19, 1960, the first anniversary of the signing of the Land Reform Law, more than 146,100 caballerías of land had been processed for requisition (one caballería equals 201.45 Chinese mu), of which 120,000 caballerías were occupied by foreign companies, mainly American companies. Most of the country's arable land has been taken over or requisitioned. The work of assessing compensation for requisitioned land will be completed on July 26 this year. The 80,000 caballerías of sugar cane fields occupied by large sugar plantations have already been requisitioned this sugar cane harvest season, along with 200 million arrobas (one arroba equals 22.676 jin) of sugar cane, and handed over to 200,000 agricultural workers participating in sugar cane production cooperatives.

According to the land reform law, the land requisitioned is distributed free of charge to farmers for individual or collective production. Collective production takes three forms: special cooperatives established on the basis of confiscated estates of counter-revolutionaries and on state-owned land, ordinary cooperatives voluntarily organized by farmers who have been allocated land, and state-owned farms. By May of this year, 539 agricultural cooperatives, 10 pastoral cooperatives, 199 agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, 8 poultry cooperatives, 7 coal cooperatives, and 1 timber industry cooperative had been organized nationwide. In addition, there are 40 other small cooperatives. At the same time, the National Land Reform Committee has established nearly a thousand sugar cane planting cooperatives on the land of the expropriated large sugar cane plantation owners.

Before the victory of the revolution, due to the greedy plunder of U.S. imperialist monopoly capital, Cuba had long been a raw material supplier country with a single product: sugar. Therefore, despite Cuba's fertile land, suitable climate and rainfall for agriculture, and hardworking and brave people, it could not solve the problem of self-sufficiency in food and vegetables. For this reason, it had to spend more than 170 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange each year to import agricultural products from abroad, mainly from the United States. Importing rice alone from the United States cost 40 million U.S. dollars. This semi-colonial economic structure was entirely created by U.S. monopoly capital. After the victory of the revolution, the Cuban government resolutely carried out land reform, organized cooperatives, and vigorously developed the production of multiple crops, striving to stop importing most agricultural products within two or three years. For traditional products such as sugar cane, tobacco, and coffee, the policy of appropriately reducing cultivated land area and increasing technical equipment to increase yield per unit area was adopted. This will not only ensure a substantial increase in the yield of these traditional crops, but also free up more land to grow other crops. The Cuban government is also planning to vigorously develop the production of rice, corn, soybeans, peanuts, vegetables, cotton, forestry, and fisheries.

Land reform, rural cooperativization, and diversified crop management have brought Cuba's agriculture into a stage of planned production development, and the yield of various crops has greatly increased. In 1959, the sugar cane harvest exceeded the planned 5.8 million tons, reaching 5.98 million tons; coffee increased by 465,500 quintals compared with 1958; tobacco increased by 10.2%; rice increased by 1,588,000 quintals; cotton increased tenfold; meat increased by 33.8%; and the sown area and yield of other crops such as peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables also increased. Cuba's agricultural production has shown a new look and is moving rapidly towards the goal of self-sufficiency.

The Development of National Industry

On the basis of implementing land reform, promoting cooperativization, and developing diversified agricultural operations, the Cuban revolutionary government is actively developing national industry to gradually achieve national industrialization.

According to the current conditions and national needs, Cuba's policy for developing national industry is to start establishing heavy industry enterprises while first developing light industry; and while laying the initial foundation for a large steel industry, special attention is paid to establishing small-scale industries with less investment. The Cuban government has decided to use the 100 million U.S. dollar loan provided by the Soviet Union to build a large metallurgical enterprise with an annual output of 500,000 tons of iron, steel, castings, and steel products. At the same time, it has also decided to establish a number of mineral, fuel, power, and chemical industry enterprises within two or three years, and greatly develop the sugar industry. In the past year and a half, Cuba has established a number of new factories, including vegetable oil extraction plants, artificial nitric acid plants, artificial wood plants, brick and tile factories, light bulb factories, copper pipe factories, medical and health supplies factories, nitrogen fertilizer plants, and some paper mills using sugar cane bagasse as raw material.

The Central Planning Committee and the National Land Reform Committee play a huge role in achieving national industrialization. Both of these institutions are chaired by Prime Minister Castro. The functions of the Central Planning Committee are: to determine the general goals of national economic development; to formulate development plans and supervise their implementation; to stipulate priority sectors for private investment; to approve the establishment of new production units, the expansion of existing enterprises, and the improvement of productivity; to mobilize production factors in order to maximize the utilization of Cuba's production capacity and ensure that the proportion of national wealth created by the state and Cuban entrepreneurs increases day by day; to guarantee the improvement of the distribution of national income among various social classes and between domestic regions; to determine the guidelines of the state's foreign economic policy and to stipulate the criteria used to formulate the state budget so that the budget conforms to the development plan. The National Land Reform Committee is not only the command headquarters for implementing land reform policies and developing agricultural production, but also actually assumes the heavy responsibility of developing national industry. This committee has departments for industry, production and foreign trade, a national petroleum committee, an industrial development bank, and other institutions leading industrial and mining production. At present, the National Land Reform Committee operates 109 industrial enterprises with a value of 235 million pesos (Cuban currency, equivalent to the U.S. dollar), with more than 101 million pesos already invested. The American and British oil companies that were recently taken over are managed and led in production by the Petroleum Committee of the National Land Reform Committee.

The source of funds for Cuba's economic development is not begging for "U.S. aid" with harsh conditions and American loans and investments with high-interest exploitation, but mainly relies on domestic funds and foreign funds that are unconditional and completely controlled by the state. The planning of domestic funds comes from state budget allocations; confiscation of the property of those who cooperated with the dictatorial regime and counter-revolutionaries; voluntary donations from the working class and all laborers (4% of monthly wages); issuing people's construction bonds; increasing compulsory workdays for land reform (the funds accumulated in this way can already buy 700 tractors), etc. At the same time, the foundation for industrial development is not private capital, but state capital, that is, vigorously expanding state ownership. State ownership is the foundation and fundamental means of Cuba's economic transformation and economic development. The Cuban government opposes "free enterprise" and reserves the right to invest in all basic industries and lead non-basic industries. Naturally, this does not mean rejecting or restricting private capital that is conducive to national economic development. Private capital can cooperate with the government's plans in industrial sectors that are beneficial and necessary to the people. Now Cuba has its own national industry and is striving to achieve industrialization as soon as possible, which will lay a reliable foundation for national independence and economic independence.

The Expansion of Domestic and Foreign Markets

In order to develop the national economy and realize national industrialization, the Cuban government has taken a series of major measures to eradicate the monopoly and control of U.S. monopoly capital and Cuban large plantation owners and large bourgeoisie over Cuba's domestic and foreign trade.

Due to the implementation of land reform, farmers have been allocated land, their enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved, and their production has increased accordingly, and their income and purchasing power have also increased. The Cuban government has correspondingly taken measures to improve people's livelihoods, such as reducing rents, telephone bills, electricity bills, and medical expenses, issuing agricultural loans, and adjusting employee wages, and vigorously solving the problem of unemployment. People's consumption capacity has increased. The national income in 1959 reached 2.5 billion pesos, an increase of 17% compared with 1958, the last year of the dictatorial regime. The total employee wages in 1959 was more than 920 million pesos, about 200 million pesos more than in 1958. The first quarter of this year was more than 280 million pesos, an increase of more than 90 million pesos compared with the same period last year. All these have created favorable conditions for expanding the domestic market.

In order to eliminate the speculative and profiteering behavior of illegal merchants and abolish the exploitation of middlemen, the Cuban government has established people's markets and people's stores in urban and rural areas across the country. These markets and stores are managed by the National Land Reform Committee. People's stores directly purchase products from farmers at reasonable prices on the one hand, and supply necessities to urban residents at reasonable prices on the other hand. A handling fee of only 10% is charged on goods sold to farmers. The Cuban government attaches great importance to the form of state-owned commercial organization of people's stores and is prepared to make these stores a base for stabilizing agricultural production, providing production funds to agriculture, distributing seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, and disseminating agricultural technology among farmers. Now, more than 2,000 people's stores have been established across the country.

In terms of foreign trade, the Cuban government has adopted a policy of expanding exports, restricting the import of luxury goods and products that can be produced domestically, and developing trade relations with countries around the world, especially with socialist countries, in order to fundamentally change the past situation of relying on a single U.S. market and thus being subject to the United States. Of great significance in this regard is that after the Soviet Union purchased 500,000 tons of Cuban raw sugar twice in August and September 1959, the Soviet Union and Cuba signed a new trade and payment agreement on February 13 this year. The Soviet Union agreed to purchase 425,000 tons of Cuban raw sugar in 1960 and purchase 1 million tons of Cuban raw sugar annually in the next four years. As pointed out in a statement by the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, this is "a bold and very positive step forward on the road that has been formulated to expand and open up Cuba's foreign markets, thereby promoting economic independence and accelerating industrialization and agricultural development."

Cuba has also signed similar trade agreements with socialist countries such as China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Cuba's trade exchanges with Asian, African, and Latin American countries have also been frequent. These trades mostly take the form of barter, that is, exchanging Cuban sugar or other traditional export commodities for machinery, equipment, and other commodities needed by Cuba. This is beneficial to expanding foreign markets and developing Cuba's national economy.

Resolutely Expelling U.S. Economic Forces

The Cuban economy before the victory of the revolution was a typical semi-colonial economy. U.S. imperialism controlled Cuba's economic lifeline (such as sugar production, electricity, telephone, transportation, minerals, foreign trade, etc.) through its investment of up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in Cuba. U.S. large companies also occupied 25% (or 75% of fertile land) of Cuba's cultivated land area. In order to completely change the semi-colonial economic structure, Cuba must expel the U.S. economic forces in Cuba. In fact, due to the U.S. economic control and monopoly over Cuba, every measure taken by the Cuban people on the road to independent economic development is a serious blow to the U.S. imperialist economic rule in Cuba, which has aroused the shameless intervention and mad sabotage of the aggressive U.S. imperialism. From political slander, intimidation, division, and dispatching secret agents and colluding with traitors to disintegrate the Cuban revolution from within, to economic sabotage, blockade, retaliation, and creating difficulties; from diplomatic attempts to isolate Cuba and use the Organization of American States for collective intervention, to active preparations for armed intervention, they have really exhausted all means.

Faced with the threats, intimidation, and intervention of the enemies of the revolution, the heroic Cuban people have waged a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism. The United States has repeatedly sent notes to the Cuban government, demanding that Cuba suspend land reform; the Cuban people's response was to accelerate the implementation of land reform and take over the land occupied by the large U.S. plantation owners in advance. The United States withdrew its economic "aid" to Cuba; the Cuban people had long decided on the policy of self-reliance and striving for development, and for this "major retaliation" by the United States, just as Jiménez, director of the National Land Reform Committee of Cuba, pointed out, "We do not feel regret, because it represents a system that has long subjected our country (Cuba) to economic enslavement." Recently, the United States instigated its oil companies to refuse to refine crude oil purchased by Cuba from the Soviet Union. The Cuban government's response was to immediately take over the American and its accomplice British oil companies that violated Cuban laws and decrees and undermined Cuba's fuel production. The U.S. Congress then passed a bill granting the U.S. President the power to reduce the quota of Cuban sugar imports, and Eisenhower brazenly reduced the quota of Cuban sugar imports by 700,000 tons. The Cuban cabinet immediately passed a law authorizing the Cuban President and Prime Minister to requisition American property in Cuba when they deem it beneficial to defend national interests.

The great achievements Cuba has made in expelling U.S. economic forces and independently developing its national economy show that a small country like Cuba, which has long been controlled and plundered by U.S. monopoly capital and bound by the domestic semi-feudal latifundia system, as long as it establishes a sovereign government that conforms to the interests of the nation and the people, bravely solves problems such as implementing land reform and expelling imperialist economic forces, and relies on the unity and resolute struggle of the people, it is entirely possible to kick aside imperialist monopoly capital and develop its own economy independently without relying on their "aid" and investment; at the same time, it is also able to crush any conspiracies of sabotage and intervention by imperialism. The Cuban revolution has set a brilliant example in Latin America not only in overthrowing the pro-American dictatorial regime through armed uprisings, but also in developing the national economy. Therefore, the economic struggle waged by the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism is of decisive significance not only for Cuba but also for the entire Latin America. The people of other Latin American countries are increasingly seeing the correct path for them to strive for national independence and economic development from the Cuban revolution, and they are convinced that what can be achieved in Cuba can certainly be achieved in other countries in Latin America.

    古巴民族经济的发展
    章叶
    古巴人民在推翻了美国傀儡巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，在保卫革命果实、反击美帝国主义干涉阴谋的同时，把改造半殖民地、半封建的经济结构，大力发展民族经济的任务，提到了首要地位，并且取得了显著的成就。
    现阶段古巴发展经济的任务主要是：一、坚决实行土地改革，建立合作社，发展农业的多种经营，以改变过去由美国所一手造成的单一作物制。二、在土地改革的基础上大力发展民族工业，特别是扩大国有制，经济计划化和由国家对经济实行监督和领导，以实现国家工业化，奠定民族独立和经济独立的基础。三、驱逐美国的经济势力，建立国家对经济、民族资源和对内对外贸易的控制，并发展同世界各国，特别是同社会主义国家的贸易关系，以摆脱美国垄断资本的残酷剥削和严密控制。四、加强财政金融管理，消除失业现象，改善人民生活，以改变古巴人民世世代代的赤贫状态。
    改变单一经济的状况
    大规模实行土地改革和把土地无偿地分配给农民，以根除阻碍生产力发展的半封建大庄园制，是古巴革命深入发展的重要标志，也是古巴争取民族经济独立发展的决定性步骤。
    在古巴，1960年被规定为“土地改革年”，这就是说，土地改革工作要在今年内完成。目前，古巴的土地改革工作已进入决定性阶段。到1960年5月19日土地改革法签署一周年时为止，已经办理征用手续的土地有十四万六千一百多卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五中国亩），其中有十二万卡瓦耶里亚是外国公司、主要是美国公司所霸占的土地。全国大部分可耕地已被接管或征用。被征用土地的作价赔偿工作，将在今年7月26日全部结束。糖业大庄园占有的八万卡瓦耶里亚的甘蔗园已经在今年这个榨糖季节被征用，连同两亿阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦等于二二点六七六市斤）的甘蔗交给参加甘蔗生产合作社的二十万农业工人。
    根据土地改革法征用的土地，都无偿地分配给农民进行个体或集体生产。集体生产的形式包括在没收的反革命分子庄园基础上和在国有土地上建立的特别合作社，由分得土地的农民自愿联合组织的普通合作社和国营农场三种形式。到今年5月间，全国已经组织了五百三十九个农业合作社，十个牧业合作社，一百九十九个农牧业合作社，八个养禽合作社，七个煤炭合作社和一个木材业合作社。此外还有四十个其他小型的合作社。同时，土地改革全国委员会已在被征用的甘蔗大庄园主的土地上建立近千个种植甘蔗的合作社。
    在革命胜利前，由于受美帝国主义垄断资本的贪婪掠夺，古巴长期是一个单一生产蔗糖的原料供应国。因此，尽管古巴有肥沃的土地，有适宜于农业的气候和雨量以及有勤劳勇敢的人民，但是，却不能解决粮食、蔬菜的自给自足问题，为此每年要耗费一亿七千多万美元的外汇从国外主要是从美国进口农产品。单是从美国进口大米就要花费四千万美元。这种半殖民地性质的经济结构完全是美国垄断资本所一手造成的。革命胜利后，古巴政府坚定地进行了土地改革，组织了合作社，大力发展多种作物生产，争取在两、三年内停止进口大多数农产品。对于传统的产品，如甘蔗、烟草、咖啡等采取适当缩小耕地面积，增加技术设备来提高单位面积产量的方针。这样既能保证这些传统作物的产量大大提高，还可以腾出更多的土地种植其他作物。古巴政府并且有计划地大力发展稻米、玉米、大豆、花生、蔬菜、棉花、林业和渔业的生产。
    土地改革、农村合作化和多种作物经营，使古巴的农业进入有计划生产的发展阶段，各种作物的产量大大提高。1959年，蔗糖收获量超过预定的五百八十万吨，达到五百九十八万吨；咖啡比1958年增加四十六万五千五百公担；烟草增加10.2％；稻米增加一百五十八万八千公担；棉花增加了十倍；肉类增加了33.8％；其他如花生、大豆和蔬菜的播种面积和产量也增加了。古巴的农业生产已经出现了一种新的面貌，并正大步向着自给自足的目标前进。
    民族工业的发展
    在实行土地改革、推行合作化和发展农业的多种经营的基础上，古巴革命政府积极发展民族工业，以逐步实现国家工业化。
    根据目前的条件和国家的需要，古巴发展民族工业的方针是：在首先发展轻工业的同时，开始建立重工业企业；在奠定巨大的钢铁工业初步基础的同时，特别重视建立投资少的小型工业。古巴政府已经决定用苏联贷给的一亿美元建立一座年产五十万吨铁、钢、铸件和钢材的大型冶金企业。同时还决定在两、三年内建立一批矿产、燃料、动力和化学工业企业，并大大发展制糖工业。一年半以来，古巴已经建立了一些新的工厂，其中有植物油榨制厂、人造硝酸厂、人造木厂、砖瓦厂、灯泡厂、铜管厂、医疗卫生用品厂、氮肥厂以及一些以甘蔗渣为原料的造纸厂。
    中央计划委员会和土地改革全国委员会在实现国家工业化中起着巨大作用。这两个机构都由卡斯特罗总理担任主席。中央计划委员会的职能是：确定国家经济发展的总目标；制定发展计划并监督其执行；为私人投资规定优先的部门；批准新的生产单位的建立，现有企业的扩大和生产率的提高；调动生产因素，以便最大限度地利用古巴的生产能力以及保障国家和古巴企业家在创造国民财富中的比重日益增长；保证改善各个社会阶级之间和国内各地区之间国民收入分配状况；确定国家对外经济政策的方针和规定用来制定国家预算的准则，使预算符合发展计划。土地改革全国委员会不仅是实行土地改革政策，发展农业生产的指挥部，而且实际上担负起发展民族工业的重责。这个委员会设有工业部、生产和对外贸易部、全国石油委员会、工业开发银行等领导工矿业生产的机构。目前，土地改革全国委员会经营着一百零九个工业企业，这些企业的价值达二亿三千五百万比索（古巴货币，与美元等值），已投入的资金在一亿零一百万比索以上。最近被接管的美英石油公司，就归土地改革全国委员会的石油委员会管理和领导生产。
    古巴发展经济的资金来源，不是乞求附有苛刻条件的“美援”以及重利盘剥的美国贷款和投资，而是主要依靠本国资金和不附任何条件并完全由国家支配的外国资金。本国资金的筹划来自国家预算拨款；没收那些与独裁政权合作的人以及反革命分子的财产；工人阶级和全体劳动者的自愿捐献（每月工资的4％）；发行人民建设公债；为土地改革增加义务工作日（用这种办法积累的资金已经可买七百部拖拉机）等等。与此同时，发展工业的基础不是私人资本，而是国家资本，即大力扩大国家所有制。国有制是古巴经济改造和经济发展的基础和根本手段。古巴政府反对“自由企业”，保留对一切基础工业的投资权利和领导非基础工业的权利。自然，这并不意味着就是拒绝或限制有利于民族经济发展的私人资本。私人资本可以在对人民有利和必要的工业部门中与政府的计划进行合作。现在古巴已经有了自己的民族工业，并争取尽快实现工业化，这将为民族独立和经济独立奠定可靠的基础。
    国内外市场的扩大
    为了发展民族经济和实现国家工业化，古巴政府在根除美国垄断资本和古巴大庄园主、大资产阶级对古巴国内外贸易的垄断和控制方面，采取了一系列重大措施。
    由于实行土地改革，农民分得了土地，生产积极性大大提高，生产量因之增加，他们的收入和购买力也提高了。古巴政府又相应地采取了诸如减低房租、电话费、电费和医药费、发放农业贷款、调整职工工资等改善人民生活的措施，并大力解决失业问题，人民的消费能力增加了。1959年的国民收入达二十五亿比索，比独裁政权最后一年的1958年增加了17％。1959年的职工工资总额是九亿二千多万比索，比1958年约多二亿比索。今年第一季度是二亿八千多万比索，比去年同期增加九千多万比索。这都为扩大国内市场创造了有利的条件。
    为了肃清不法商人投机倒把、攫取暴利的行为和废除中间人的剥削，古巴政府在全国城乡建立人民市场和人民商店。这些市场和商店由土地改革全国委员会管理。人民商店一方面用合理的价格直接向农民收购产品，另方面再以合理的价格向城市居民供应必需品。卖给农民的商品只收10％的手续费。古巴政府很重视人民商店这个国营商业组织形式，并准备使这些商店成为稳定农业生产，向农业提供生产资金，分配种子、肥料、农具以及在农民中传播农业技术的基地。现在，全国已经建立了两千多个人民商店。
    在对外贸易方面，古巴政府采取了扩大出口，限制奢侈品和本国可能生产的产品的进口，同世界各国特别是同社会主义国家发展贸易关系的政策，以根本改变过去依赖单一的美国市场，从而受制于美国的处境。在这方面具有重大意义的是继1959年8、9月苏联两次购买古巴原糖五十万吨之后，今年2月13日苏联和古巴又签订了新的贸易和支付协定，苏联同意在1960年向古巴购买四十二万五千吨原糖，并在今后四年中每年购买一百万吨原糖。正像古巴人民社会党全国委员会的一项声明所指出的，这是“在已经制定的扩大和开辟古巴的国外市场、从而促进经济独立和加速工业化和农业发展的道路上，迈出了大胆和非常积极的一步”。
    古巴还同中国、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等社会主义国家签订类似的贸易协定。古巴同亚非国家和拉丁美洲国家的贸易往来也频繁了。这些贸易多是采取换货形式，即用古巴的蔗糖或其他传统出口商品换取古巴所需要的机器、设备和其他商品。这对于扩大国外市场和发展古巴的民族经济都是有好处的。
    坚决驱逐美国的经济势力
    革命胜利前的古巴经济是典型的半殖民地经济。美帝国主义通过它在古巴的高达十亿美元的投资，控制了古巴的经济命脉（如制糖、电力、电话、交通运输、矿产、对外贸易等）。美国大公司还霸占了古巴耕地面积25％（或肥沃土地的75％）的土地。古巴为了彻底改变半殖民地的经济结构，必须驱逐美国在古巴的经济势力。而实际上，由于美国对古巴的经济控制和垄断，古巴人民在独立发展经济道路上所采取的每一措施，都是对美帝国主义在古巴的经济统治的严重打击，都引起侵略成性的美帝国主义的无耻干涉和疯狂破坏。从政治上的诽谤、恫吓、分裂和派遣特务、勾结叛徒从内部瓦解古巴革命，到经济上的破坏封锁、报复和制造困难；从外交上的力图孤立古巴并利用美洲国家组织集体干涉、到军事上的积极准备武装干涉，真是无所不用其极。
    面对着革命敌人的威胁、恫吓和干涉，英勇的古巴人民同美帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争。美国三番五次地照会古巴政府，要古巴中止土地改革；古巴人民的回答是加速进行了土地改革，并提前接管了美国大庄园主霸占的土地，美国撤消了对古巴的经济“援助”，古巴人民早已决定自力更生，争取发展的方针，对于美国的这个“重大报复”，正像古巴土地改革全国委员会主任希门尼斯所指出的，“并不感到遗憾，因为它代表着长久以来使我国（古巴）遭受经济奴役的制度”。最近美国指使它的石油公司拒绝提炼古巴购自苏联的原油，古巴政府的回答是立即接管违反古巴法律和法令、破坏古巴燃料生产的美国和它的帮凶英国的石油公司。美国国会又通过授予美国总统以削减进口古巴食糖份额权力的法案，艾森豪威尔并悍然把古巴食糖进口定额削减七十万吨，古巴内阁当即通过一项授权古巴总统和总理在他们认为有利于保卫国家利益时征用美国人在古巴的财产的法律。
    古巴在驱逐美国经济势力、独立发展民族经济所取得的巨大成就表明，像古巴这样长期受美国垄断资本控制、掠夺和受国内半封建大庄园制束缚的小国，只要建立符合民族和人民利益的主权政府，勇敢地解决像实行土地改革和驱逐帝国主义经济势力，依靠人民的团结和人民的坚决斗争，是完全可以一脚踢开帝国主义垄断资本，不依靠他们的“援助”和投资，而独立发展自己的经济的；同时也是能够粉碎帝国主义任何破坏、干涉的阴谋活动的。古巴革命不仅在以武装起义推翻亲美独裁政权方面，而且也在发展民族经济方面，在拉丁美洲树立了光辉的榜样。因此，古巴人民同美帝国主义进行的经济斗争，不仅对古巴而且对整个拉丁美洲都有决定性的意义。拉丁美洲其他国家人民日益从古巴革命中看到他们争取民族独立和经济发展的正确道路，并使他们相信，在古巴能够实现的，在拉丁美洲其他国家也一定能够实现。（附图片）
