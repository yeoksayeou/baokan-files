Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 24th. Sichuan Province is vigorously grasping fuel production and is finding various ways to ensure steel production with coal. At present, the Party committees in various coal-producing areas have made vigorously grasping coal production their top priority.

	This year, on the basis of continuous increases in coal production in the first half of the year, Sichuan Province has achieved sustained leaps forward, with raw coal production increasing by 50.5% compared to the same period last year. However, due to the development of the province's iron and steel industry, other industries, and agricultural technical transformation, the supply of coal and coke still cannot fully meet the needs. To this end, various localities in the province are taking the following effective measures to vigorously promote coal production increases.

	Plan and focus on the technical transformation of small coal pits, so as to rapidly increase their production capacity. In the vigorous effort to transform small coal pits, all localities, in line with the spirit of shortening the battle lines and concentrating forces to complete the work in batches as proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, have adopted the method of relying mainly on local resources, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and self-reliance. Starting from July, they first launched a key transformation of thirty small coal pits along the railway lines with a daily output of more than one hundred tons. After the transformation of these thirty coal pits, the output will increase by more than three times compared to now, which will greatly help solve the current urgent needs and long-term needs. In addition to this, the province will also adopt the method of "filling in whatever is lacking" to complete the unfinished projects of the 1959 annual transformation of one hundred and twenty small coal pits as soon as possible. For the small coal pits run by the communes throughout the province, the experience of Yongchuan Tongxing Coal Mine is being adopted to implement indigenous transformation.

	Vigorously improve underground and surface transportation to promote a substantial increase in coal and coke production. According to the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee, the "three reforms" are being implemented in underground transportation in various mining areas: reforming roadways—straightening curved roadways and enlarging small roadways; reforming tracks—reinforcing roadways and converting single tracks to double tracks; reforming cars—converting small cars to large cars and converting single cars to trains. In terms of surface transportation, each coal mine is carrying out a mass movement of a "new five transformations" on the basis of "one network and five transformations." The contents of the "new five transformations" are: transportation linkage, connecting various transportation tools to achieve transportation from start to finish as much as possible; "automation," requiring automatic gliding and automatic loading and unloading; double-tracking; train formation; and ball bearing application.

	Vigorously grasp tunneling and make great efforts in production preparation. At present, the main problem in coal mine production throughout the province is that tunneling cannot keep up with mining. In order to ensure that tunneling always stays ahead, the Provincial Party Committee requires that all mines guarantee one-quarter of preparatory working faces. At present, all localities are strengthening tunneling leadership, enriching tunneling teams, and actively promoting the experience of rapid tunneling in various localities to accelerate tunneling speed.

	In order to ensure the realization of the raw coal production tasks, the coal industry departments of the province and the cadres at all levels in the mining areas have resolutely implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on cadres and workers practicing the "four togethers" and earnestly improving leadership style and working methods. The command center of the Provincial Coal Department has been moved to Yongrong Mining Bureau in Rongchang, and 81% of the cadres have settled down at the mine entrances. At the same time, except for one director of the Coal Department who is taking the method of going up and down to stay in Chongqing to command the overall situation, the remaining four directors have each led a team to go deep into the front line of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 24th. Hebei Province is actively implementing the policy of "concentrating forces and ensuring key points," accelerating the construction of new coal mines, expanding raw coal production capacity, and providing sufficient "food" for the sustained leap forward in industrial production. As of the beginning of this month, eight new mine pairs in the province have been completed on time or ahead of schedule and put into production. The Tongshun No. 2 Mine of Fengfeng Coal Mine, a large-scale mine designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union, was recently completed eleven months ahead of the original design construction time.

	Among the new and continuing mine construction projects in Hebei Province this year, there are large-scale mines with an annual output of more than 600,000 tons, as well as medium and small-sized mines with an annual output of 100,000 to 450,000 tons of raw coal. In the process of building these mines, the coal industry leadership departments have firmly grasped the new mines that are planned to be put into production this year, and with this as the focus, adopted the method of concentrating superior forces and fighting annihilation battles in stages and batches to organize high-speed construction and ensure that key projects are delivered for production ahead of schedule. The Provincial Coal Mine Construction Bureau has determined that the Tongshun No. 2 Mine and Niu'erzhuang large-scale mine of Fengfeng Coal Mine are the key construction projects, concentrating more than 65% of the bureau's forces in civil engineering, mining construction, installation, and transportation to carry out rapid construction. Through the project scheduling in the construction, the various projects are closely coordinated, connected, and mutually promoted. For example, when constructing the main headframe of Tongshun No. 2 Mine, the construction force was well arranged through project scheduling, so that mining construction, civil engineering, and the main headframe were operated in parallel and crosswise, ensuring the completion of the reinforced concrete main headframe ahead of schedule. At the same time, the construction department also continuously organized balancing work, concentrating the limited manpower, materials, and transportation capacity on the most urgently needed key projects, fighting annihilation battles and accelerating the construction speed.

	The strong support of the mechanical industry workers throughout the province has also played a significant role in ensuring the early completion and delivery of new mines, especially large-scale mines. Under the slogan of "fully ensuring steel and ensuring steel with coal," the mechanical industry workers in Tianjin rushed to manufacture coal mining equipment, completing more than two months of production tasks in just over a month, and manufacturing 89 items, a total of 194 sets (pieces) of coal mining equipment. Forty-eight mechanical factories also manufactured non-standard coal mining equipment weighing more than 400 tons ahead of schedule. These equipments were all transported to the new coal mines in time, ensuring timely installation.

    四川狠抓具体措施改造小煤窑  河北集中优势力量赶建新煤井
    新华社重庆24日电　四川省狠抓燃料生产，多方设法以煤保钢。目前，各产煤区的党委已经把狠抓煤炭生产作为当前的首要任务。
    今年上半年四川省的煤炭生产在连年增产的基础上，获得了持续跃进，原煤产量比去年同期增长50.5％。但是，由于全省钢铁工业和其它工业以及农业技术改造的发展，煤焦供应仍不能充分满足需要。为此，全省各地正在采取以下有效措施，大力促进煤炭增产。
    有计划有重点地对小煤窑进行技术改造，以便迅速增长它们的生产能力。各地在大抓小煤窑的改造中，都本着省委提出的缩短战线、集中力量分批完成的精神，采取以土为主，土洋结合，自力更生的办法，从7月份起首先对铁路沿线的三十个日产一百吨以上的小煤窑展开了重点改造。这三十个煤窑改造后，产量将比现在提高三倍多，这对解决当前急需和长远需要都有很大作用。除此以外，全省还将采取缺啥补啥的办法，尽快完成1959年度的一百二十个小煤窑改造的扫尾工程。对全省各社办小煤窑，正在采用永川同兴煤矿的经验，实行土法改造。
    大力改进井下和地面运输，促进煤焦大幅度增产。根据省委要求，各个矿区的井下运输正在实行“三改”，改巷——弯巷改直巷，小巷改大巷；改道——加固车道，单道改双道；改车——小车改大车，一车改列车。在地面运输方面，各煤矿正在“一网五化”的基础上开展一个“新五化”的群众运动。“新五化”的内容是：运输联动化，各项运输工具衔接起来，尽可能一车到底；“自动化”，要求达到自动滑行、自动装卸；双轨化；列车化；滚珠轴承化。
    狠抓掘进，大抓生产准备。当前全省煤矿生产主要是掘进跟不上回采。为了让掘进始终保持超前，省委要求所有矿井都要保证有四分之一的预备工作面。目前，各地正在加强掘进领导，充实掘进队伍，积极推广各地快速掘进的经验，以加快掘进速度。
    为了保证原煤生产任务的实现，省煤炭工业部门和各矿区的各级干部，都坚决贯彻执行了省委关于干部与工人实行“四同”的指示，切实改进领导作风和工作方法。省煤炭厅的指挥中心已经放到荣昌永荣矿务局，81％的干部已到井口安家落户。同时，煤炭厅的五名厅长除一名采取上上下下的办法住重庆指挥全盘以外，其余四名厅长已各带一套人马深入生产第一线。
    新华社天津24日电　河北省积极贯彻“集中力量，保证重点”的方针，加速煤炭新矿井的建设，扩大原煤生产能力，为工业生产持续跃进提供充足的“食粮”。到本月上旬止，全省今年已有八对新建矿井按时或提前建成投入生产。苏联帮助我国设计的大型矿井——峰峰煤矿通顺二号矿井，已比原设计建设时间提前十一个月在最近建成。
    河北省今年新建和续建的矿井中，有年产六十万吨以上的大型矿井，也有年产十万至四十五万吨原煤的中小型矿井。在建设这批矿井的过程中，煤炭工业领导部门紧紧抓住计划在今年内投入生产的新矿井，并且以此为重点，采取集中优势兵力、分期分批打歼灭战的方法，组织高速度施工，保证重点工程提前交付生产。省煤矿基建局确定以峰峰煤矿通顺二号和牛儿庄大型矿井为建设重点，集中了全局土建、矿建、安装、运输方面的65％以上的力量，进行快速施工。施工中通过工程项目排队，作到各项工程紧密配合，相互衔接，相互促进。如建设通顺二号矿井主井楼时，通过工程项目排队，很好地安排了施工力量，使矿建、土建和主井楼上楼下实行了平行交叉作业，保证提前完成了钢筋混凝土主井楼的施工任务。同时，施工部门还不断组织平衡工作，把有限的人力、物力、运力集中起来，用到最急需的重点工程上去，大打歼灭战，从而加快了建设速度。
    全省机械工业职工的大力支援，对于保证新建矿井特别是大型矿井的提前竣工交付生产，也起了很大作用。天津市机械工业职工在“全力保钢，以煤保钢”的口号下，突击赶制煤矿设备，仅用一个多月时间就完成了两个多月的生产任务，制造出八十九项共一百九十四台（条）煤矿设备。有四十八个机械工厂还提前制造出重达四百多吨的煤矿非标准设备。这些设备都及时运到了新建煤矿，保证了按时安装。
