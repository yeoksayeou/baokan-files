　　"Suddenly News Came of Tiger Subdued in the World"
　　Wang Chong

    Chairman Mao's "Butterfly Loves Flowers" contains the line "Suddenly news came of tiger subdued in the world," which was originally a figurative metaphor. However, our era is a great era in which the working people dominate the world, astonishing heaven and earth, and every worker is filled with the "magnificent spirit" of contributing everything to the cause of socialism and communism. This magnificent spirit is so powerful that it pierces the bullfights and "fills the vast sky." "Subduing tigers in the world" has become a real thing that people praise endlessly.

    Hong Guizhen, a representative from Hunan Province who attended the National Conference of Cultural and Educational Heroes, is a medical worker. One night, the organization assigned her an urgent task: to go to the home of a critically ill patient for emergency treatment. Because it was late and the road was far, two people accompanied her. As they walked into the deep mountains, suddenly a loud roar of a tiger came from the mountain ahead. The two escorts were frightened and dared not move forward, but Hong Guizhen thought that she was a Communist Party member, and the organization wanted her to rescue the patient. How could she ignore the patient? So, she resolutely moved forward and said, "People are 30% afraid of tigers, and tigers are 70% afraid of people. Walk forward boldly, and the tiger will definitely be afraid of people." So she raised the torch high, bravely moved forward, and finally scared away the tiger, successfully completing the emergency rescue mission. People praised her, saying, "Mother Hong is wholeheartedly for the patient, and she is not even afraid of tigers. She is a doctor like no other!"

    This is truly a moving deed!

    The tiger has always been known as the "king of beasts"! There is a Chinese idiom that says, "Talk of tigers turns pale." This illustrates the ferocity of tigers and the threat they pose to people. Just "talking" about them is enough to make one "turn pale," let alone "encountering" a tiger. However, true heroes are not afraid of tigers. The lofty spirit of communism inspires Hong Guizhen, and the sense of responsibility of a revolutionary medical worker, like a magnet attracting iron filings, firmly attracts her, finally inspiring her to brave the danger of death under the revolutionary humanitarianism of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, going through fire and water among wild beasts without the slightest fear.

    "People are 30% afraid of tigers, and tigers are 70% afraid of people" is just an abstract metaphor. Wild beasts are still wild beasts, and tigers are not just big cats. They have no "reason" to speak of. The "70% afraid of people" only applies to those who possess this lofty spirit. Because the question of who is afraid of whom between tigers and people is relative, referring to the contrasting relationship between people and tigers. We can imagine that those individualists and cowards who only think about their own safety and gains and losses are not "30% afraid of tigers" in this situation, but always "100% afraid of tigers." A person with noble communist qualities, a person with a high sense of responsibility, a selfless person, can be completely unafraid of tigers and dare to raise the torch high and move forward bravely! And the tiger, seeing the raging fire, coming on fiercely, fled to the deep mountains and dense forests.

    Perhaps some people will say, "Isn't this a bit risky?" "Wouldn't it be about the same to go another day?" Yes, encountering a tiger in the mountains at night is very dangerous. This is something that even three-year-old children know. However, as Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility in his work and his extreme warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people." Comrade Hong Guizhen is someone who has earnestly studied Comrade Bethune's spirit of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self."

  "Serving the people" and "serving the revolutionary cause" are the most concrete, not abstract. Serving the revolutionary cause when things are calm and smooth is always much easier, but when facing storms, floods, beasts, and imminent disasters, it is the most difficult and most serious test. A revolutionary will withstand this severe test, just like Comrade Hong Guizhen. What she considers first is the safety of the patient, the trust that the Party and the people have placed in her, and therefore, she can have the great spirit of daring to risk life and death, putting her own life and death aside, being selfless and acting bravely for a just cause.

### “忽报人间曾伏虎”

　　“忽报人间曾伏虎”
　　王重
    毛主席的“蝶恋花”中有“忽报人间曾伏虎”的句子，这原来是一句形象化的比喻。但是，我们的时代是劳动人民叱咤风云，惊天地泣鬼神的伟大时代，每个劳动者都充沛着为社会主义和共产主义事业而贡献一切的“浩然之气”。这种浩然之气，是气贯斗牛，“沛乎塞苍冥”的。“人间伏虎”成了令人赞口不绝的真实事情。
    上次出席全国文教群英会的湖南省代表洪桂贞是个医务工作者。一天深夜组织上分配一项紧急任务，要她去到一家垂危的病人家里去急救。因为夜深路远，有两个人陪着。当他们走进深山时，忽然前面山头传来老虎吼叫的巨响。两个陪行的人都吓得心惊肉跳，不敢向前，但是，洪桂贞想到自己是一个共产党员，组织上要自己去急救病人，怎么能够把病人不管呢？于是，便坚决向前，并且说：“人有三分怕虎，虎有七分怕人。大胆往前走，老虎定怕人。”于是高举火把，勇敢向前，终于吓跑了老虎，胜利地完成了急救的任务。人们满口称赞说：“洪妈妈一心为病人，连老虎都不怕，真是从来没见过的医生！”
    这真是感人肺腑的事迹！
    老虎，一向被人称为“兽中之王”！我国有句成语叫：“谈虎色变”。这就可以说明老虎的凶猛和对人的威胁了。只要一“谈”起，尚且为之“变色”，更不消说是“遇”上老虎了。但是，真正的英雄是不怕虎的。共产主义的崇高精神鼓舞着洪桂贞，革命的医务工作者的责任感，像磁石吸着铁粉一样，紧紧地吸引着她，终于在救死扶伤的革命的人道主义的鼓舞下冒着生命的危险，蹈汤赴火地出入于猛兽之间而丝毫无惧色。
    “人有三分怕虎，虎有七分怕人”，这只是一句抽象的比喻而已。野兽总还是野兽，老虎总不是大猫，它是没有丝毫“道理”可讲的。“虎有七分怕人”，这个“七分”，也只有在具有这种崇高精神的人面前，才能如此。因为虎与人之间谁怕谁的问题，是相对而言的，是指人与老虎之间的对比关系而言的。我们可以设想得到：那些一切只为个人打算的个人主义者和胆小鬼，总是先考虑自己的安危和得失，在这种场合不可能是“三分怕虎”，而总是“十分怕虎”的。一个具有崇高的共产主义的品质的人，一个有高度责任感的人，一个大公无私的人，就能完全不怕虎，敢于高举着火把，勇往直前了！而老虎看见熊熊的烈火，来势汹汹，便逃遁到深山密林中去了。
    也许有人会说：“这未免有点冒险”，“改天再去不是差不多吗？”是的，深夜山中遇虎的情况是十分危险的。这是连三岁儿童都知道的事情。但是，正如毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”洪桂贞同志是认真学习了白求恩同志的这种“毫不利己专门利人”的精神的人。
  “为人民服务”、“为革命事业服务”是最具体的，而不是抽象的。在风平浪静、一帆风顺的时候为革命事业服务总是容易得多的，但是一到狂风骇浪、洪水猛兽、大难临头的时候，却是一个最艰难的而又最严肃的考验的关头，一个革命者是会经得起这个严峻的考验的，正像洪桂贞同志那样，她首先考虑的是病人的安危，考虑的是党和人民对自己的重托，因此，才可能产生敢于出生入死、置自己的生死于度外的大公无私、见义勇为的伟大精神。
