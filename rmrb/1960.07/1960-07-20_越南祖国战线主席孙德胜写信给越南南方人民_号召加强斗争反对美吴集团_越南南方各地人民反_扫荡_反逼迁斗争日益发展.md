Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: Sun Desheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, wrote a letter to the people of South Vietnam on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, calling on the people of South Vietnam to unite and fight.

Sun Desheng said that currently, the struggle of the people in countries enslaved by the United States to overthrow the US puppet regimes in their own countries is on the rise, and US imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation. World peace and democratic forces are engaged in unremitting struggles to thoroughly expose the aggressive and bellicose face of US imperialism. He also said that the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is very strong and has already bewildered the US-Ngo clique.

Sun Desheng warmly praised the South Vietnamese people's spirit of tenacious and unyielding heroic struggle over the past six years, and severely condemned the US-Ngo clique's crimes over the past six years of slaughtering patriotic people, undermining the Geneva Accords, and turning South Vietnam into a US military base for launching wars.

In the letter, Sun Desheng called on the South Vietnamese people to unite more closely and more widely, strengthen revolutionary vigilance, persevere in their struggle, and smash the US imperialists' aggression and war conspiracies, and oppose the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's crimes of selling out the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: The flames of struggle of the South Vietnamese people against US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique are raging in various places.

In order to intensify the suppression of the people, the US-Ngo clique has carried out brutal "sweeps" in various places, but the people in various places have risen up in self-defense. In western Quang Ngai province, the mountainous areas of the Fifth Interzone, and western Quang Tri and Thua Thien, local people have adopted effective actions such as sealing off villages, digging pit traps, and setting up hidden bows to counter the "sweeps." In Quang Nam, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Kien Tuong, My Tho, Can Tho and other provinces, the local people have carried out fierce struggles against merging villages and forced relocation. The masses guarded their houses and land and fought with the police who set fire to houses and crops. Many people used spears and wooden sticks to resist Ngo Dinh Diem's henchmen. In the past two months, the people of four villages in Thu Dau Mot province have jointly carried out more than 20 anti-forced relocation struggles, and hundreds of residents have shouted slogans in front of the puppet county government such as "Oppose concentration into dense areas."

The US-Ngo clique originally planned to establish 70 "dense areas" in South Vietnam to concentrate one-tenth of the population of South Vietnam. However, the work of establishing "dense areas" has progressed slowly under the resolute opposition of the South Vietnamese people.

People in some areas of South Vietnam have already taken back the land seized from them by the US-Ngo clique and their supporters—the despotic landlords. In the Central Highlands region, residents of twelve villages jointly launched a struggle against the forced establishment of "reclamation areas" by means of destroying canals and plundering land. More than 2,000 men, women, and children marched to the "Reclamation Area Steering Committee" to hold demonstrations and protests. The director of the "Reclamation Area," who attempted to intimidate the people by opening fire, was thrown into the canal by the demonstrators. The struggle lasted for three days and nights. Finally, the reactionary authorities were forced to write a guarantee to return the land to the people and compensate for the losses. At the same time, the South Vietnamese people's struggles against conscription, arrest of soldiers, and construction of military bases also continued.

In many places in My Tho, Ben Tre, Kien Tuong, and Kien Phong provinces, slogans condemning the US-Ngo clique have continuously appeared on highlands, large trees, transportation lines, and many factories, enterprises, and even the organs and barracks of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Many notoriously sinful henchmen of Ngo Dinh Diem have been punished by the people. Nguyen Dinh Thuan, the "Minister of the Presidential Palace" of South Vietnam, recently admitted that since September of last year, thousands of US-Ngo clique's lackeys have been killed by the people.

Due to the increasingly high tide of the South Vietnamese people's struggle, the soldiers in the US-Ngo clique's army generally hate war, and desertion incidents continue to occur. Sometimes more than 100 soldiers desert at a time.

　　越南祖国战线主席孙德胜写信给越南南方人民
　　号召加强斗争反对美吴集团
　　越南南方各地人民反“扫荡”反逼迁斗争日益发展
    新华社河内19日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会主席孙德胜在日内瓦协议签订六周年前夕，写信给南越人民，号召南越人民团结斗争。
    孙德胜说，目前，被美国奴役的国家的人民为推翻本国的美国走狗政权的斗争正在高涨，美帝国主义已经陷于空前的孤立。世界和平和民主力量正在进行不懈的斗争，以彻底揭穿美帝国主义的侵略和好战嘴脸。他又说，南越人民反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的斗争非常强大，并且已经使得美吴集团不知所措。
    孙德胜热烈赞扬了南越人民六年来坚韧不屈的英勇斗争精神，并严厉谴责美吴集团六年来屠杀爱国人民、破坏日内瓦协议、把南越变成美国用来发动战争的军事基地等罪行。
    孙德胜在信里号召南越人民更紧密地、更广泛地团结起来，加强革命警惕性，坚持不懈地进行斗争，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋，反对吴庭艳集团的买国罪行。
    新华社河内17日电　南越人民反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的斗争怒火，正在各地熊熊燃烧。
    美吴集团为了加紧镇压人民，在各地进行了残酷的“扫荡”，但是各地人民纷纷起来自卫。在广义省西部、第五联区山区、广治、承天西部，当地人民为了反“扫荡”，采取了封村、挖陷井、装置暗弓等有效的行动。在广南、槟椥、永隆、建祥、美萩、芹苴等省、当地人民进行了反对并村、逼迁的激烈斗争。群众守卫在他们的房屋和土地上，同纵火焚烧房子和庄稼的警察展开了搏斗。许多群众用长矛和木棍抗击着吴庭艳的爪牙。在最近两个月，土龙木省有四个乡的人民联合起来进行了二十多次反逼迁的斗争，成百的居民到伪县政府前高呼“反对集中到稠密区去”的口号。
    美吴集团原准备在南越建立七十个“稠密区”，以集中全南越十分之一的人口。但是在南越人民的坚决反对下建立“稠密区”的工作进展迟缓。
    南越一些地方的人民已经从美吴集团和它们的支持者——恶霸地主手中夺回了被抢去的土地。在西原地区，有十二个村庄的居民联合展开了斗争，反对用破坏水渠、掠夺土地的手段来强迫建立“垦荒区”。两千多男女老幼浩浩荡荡地奔赴“垦荒区指导委员会”举行示威抗议，企图开枪威吓人民的“垦荒区”主任被示威群众抛进水渠。斗争坚持了三昼夜，最后，反动当局被迫写下把土地还给人民、赔偿损失的保证书。同时，南越人民反对拉伕、抓兵和修建军事基地的斗争也不断发生。
    在美萩、槟椥、建祥、建丰等省的许多地方的高地、大树、交通线上和许多工厂、企业甚至吴庭艳集团的机关和兵营里，也不断出现谴责美吴集团的标语。不少罪恶昭彰的吴庭艳的爪牙受到人民的惩罚。南越“总统府部长”阮庭纯不久前承认，去年9月以来，已有成千的美吴集团的走狗被人民打死。
    由于南越人民的斗争怒潮日益高涨，美吴集团军队里的士兵普遍厌战，不断发生逃跑事件，有时开小差的士兵一次有百人以上。
