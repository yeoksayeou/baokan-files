Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu - Sichuan Province's agricultural machinery industry departments are rushing to produce irrigation and drainage equipment suitable for different regions and different needs, and are doing everything possible to ensure that each piece produced is matched with necessary components, and each piece installed is put into use. As of the end of June, the province's newly manufactured irrigation and drainage equipment this year has reached 100,000 horsepower, an increase of more than four times compared to the irrigation and drainage equipment delivered to the agricultural sector last year.

In organizing the production of agricultural power irrigation and drainage equipment, Sichuan Province's agricultural machinery industry departments are, on the one hand, organizing more than 50 factories with better technology and equipment to produce complete sets of irrigation and drainage equipment and some precision, large-sized components and parts; on the other hand, according to the principle of self-production, self-allocation, self-use, and self-repair, they are giving full play to local production potential and organizing various special districts (autonomous prefectures) and counties to produce on their own. This has created a manufacturing, repair, and collaboration network throughout the province, with large factories as the mainstay, and a combination of large, medium, and small factories.

In order to enable this batch of rushed irrigation and drainage equipment to quickly play a role in agricultural production, various special districts (autonomous prefectures) and counties are doing everything possible to ensure that each piece produced is matched with necessary components, and each piece installed is put into use, based on their own technical strength and equipment conditions. Mianyang, Nanchong, and other ten special districts have now organized installation professional teams to travel around to help communes solve technical problems. Pengxi County lacked irrigation and drainage machinery accessories, so they used local materials to vigorously produce substitutes, churning out 890 wooden elbows, more than 2,000 meters of bamboo and wooden water pipes, and more than 1,000 wooden flange plates, so that all 99 water pumps in the county were installed in time and put into production.

Various parts of Sichuan are also adopting short-term, concentrated methods to quickly train technical personnel, so that every machine has an operator. The province has trained more than 20,000 new machine operators, and it is planned that by the end of the year, the province will train 160,000 new machine operators. Ziyang County drew a group of technicians from industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation departments to go to various places to implement "three carries" (bring their own tools, bring their own spare parts, bring their own technology) and "four guarantees" (guarantee installation, guarantee use, guarantee repair and allocation, guarantee technology transfer), so that the normal operation rate of irrigation and drainage equipment in the county remains at around 84%. Various places are also paying attention to repairing damaged irrigation and drainage equipment, giving full play to the role of irrigation and drainage equipment and water lifting tools. The more than 500-member repair team organized by Jiangjin Special District is going to the countryside to conduct mobile emergency repairs. More than half of the irrigation and drainage machinery in the district that needs to be repaired has been repaired. Nanchong, Leshan, and other special districts have adopted the method of assigning responsibility by area, assigning repair tasks to factories and workshops, setting deadlines, quantities, and quality requirements, and completing them within a time limit.

### 生产一台配套一台　安装一台使用一台  四川把大批排灌设备送到公社

    生产一台配套一台　安装一台使用一台
    四川把大批排灌设备送到公社
    新华社成都讯　四川省农业机械工业部门赶制适于不同地区不同需要的排灌设备，并千方百计地做到生产一台就配套一台，安装一台就使用一台。截至6月底为止，全省今年新制出的排灌设备已达十万马力，比去年交付农业部门使用的排灌设备增长了四倍多。
    四川省农业机械工业部门在组织农业动力排灌设备的生产中，一方面组织五十多个技术设备较好的厂，生产成套的排灌设备和一些精密、大型的部件和零件；另一方面根据自产自配自用自修的原则，充分发挥地方生产潜力，组织各专区（州）、县自行生产。这样就在全省范围内构成了一个以大型厂为主、大型厂和中、小型厂相结合的制造修配协作网。
    为了使这批赶制出来的排灌设备迅速在农业生产中发挥作用，各专区（州）、县根据自己的技术力量和设备情况，千方百计做到生产一台配套一台，安装一台就使用一台。绵阳、南充等十个专区现在已组织了安装专业队巡回各地帮助公社解决技术问题。蓬溪县缺乏排灌机械配件，便就地取材，大搞代用品，铡成木质弯头八百九十件，竹、木质水管二千多米，木质法蓝盘一千多个，使全县九十九台抽水机及时安装好投入生产。
    四川各地还采取短期突击的办法，迅速培训技术力量，做到台台机器有机手。全省已培养出二万多名新机手，计划到年底全省将培训新机手十六万人。资阳县从工、农、商、交等部门抽调出一批技工人员，分赴各地实行“三带”（自带工具、自带备件、自带技术）、“四包”（包安装、包使用、包修配、包传授技术），使全县排灌设备正常转率保持在84％左右。各地还注意修复损坏的排灌设备，充分发挥排灌设备和提水机具的作用。江津专区组织的五百多人检修队，下乡巡回抢修，全区需要修理的排灌机械，目前已修复了一半以上。南充、乐山等专区采取划片包干的办法，把修理任务落实到厂和车间，定时、定量、定质，限期完成。
