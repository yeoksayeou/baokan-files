Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch - The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity today sent a telegram to Mohammed, Secretary-General of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, and forwarded it to the demonstration, extending warm congratulations and support to the heroic people of Zanzibar, as the people of Zanzibar held their second demonstration against the establishment of a U.S. military base in Zanzibar.
    The telegram said that the U.S. imperialist plot to establish a rocket base in Zanzibar under the guise of setting up a "scientific research probing station" and to build hydrogen bomb bomber bases in East and Central Africa is part of the U.S. plot to infiltrate and invade Zanzibar and East and Central Africa. This powerful demonstration by the people of Zanzibar has forced the U.S. aggressors to admit that the plan to build a military base in Zanzibar is "inappropriate." This is a major victory for the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the people of Zanzibar. We believe that the people of Zanzibar and East and Central Africa will strengthen their struggle and completely smash this U.S. aggressive plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch - The All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram on the 8th to the Women's Department of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, stating that as the people of Zanzibar hold their second large-scale protest demonstration against U.S. imperialism's establishment of a rocket base in Zanzibar, hundreds of millions of Chinese women once again express their heartfelt respect and firm support to their brothers and sisters in Zanzibar.
    The telegram said that U.S. imperialism is establishing military bases everywhere in Zanzibar, Africa, and around the world, massively infiltrating Africa, and frantically plundering the resources of the African people. This further exposes its aggressive and war-mongering conspiracies and its true face of false peace and real war preparations. All this also shows that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the African people and women, as well as the people and women of the world.
    The telegram pointed out that the struggle of the people of Zanzibar against U.S. imperialism and for national independence is not isolated. With the sympathy and support of peace-loving people and women in Africa and around the world, the people and women of Zanzibar will unite more closely, persist in the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end, and achieve the final victory against U.S. imperialism and colonialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch - The All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram on the 8th to the Zanzibar Youth's Own League, fully supporting the heroic struggle of the people and youth of Zanzibar against the U.S. imperialist plot to establish a rocket base in Zanzibar.
    The telegram said: "Recently, we were excited to learn that 50,000 people in Zanzibar held a large-scale demonstration to protest against the U.S. imperialist plot to establish a rocket base in Zanzibar and will hold another demonstration of 100,000 people on the 10th, setting off a bigger anti-U.S. struggle storm. Countless facts prove that U.S. imperialism is the head of all imperialism, the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the African people, and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. The Chinese youth fully support the heroic struggle of the people and youth of Zanzibar against U.S. imperialism and firmly believe that your just struggle against imperialism and for independence and freedom will surely achieve a complete victory."

    我亚非团结委员会、妇联、青联分别发出电报
    支持桑给巴尔人民反对美国基地的斗争
    新华社8日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天在桑给巴尔人民举行第二次反对美国在桑给巴尔建立军事基地示威大会的时候，致电桑给巴尔民族主义党总书记穆罕默德并转示威大会，向英勇的桑给巴尔人民表示热烈的祝贺和支持。
    电报说，美帝国主义以设立“科学研究探测站”作伪装，在桑给巴尔建立火箭基地和在东、中非建立氢弹轰炸机基地的阴谋计划，是美国向桑给巴尔和东、中非实行渗入和侵略的阴谋计划的一部分。桑给巴尔人民这次强大的示威，迫使美国侵略者不得不出来表示在桑给巴尔建立军事基地的计划是“不适宜的”。这是桑给巴尔人民反美爱国斗争的重大胜利。我们相信，桑给巴尔和东、中非人民一定会加强斗争，彻底粉碎美国的这个侵略计划。
    新华社9日讯　全国妇女联合会8日致电桑给巴尔民族主义党妇女部说，在桑给巴尔人民为反对美帝国主义在桑给巴尔建立火箭基地，举行第二次声势浩大的抗议示威之际，亿万中国妇女再一次向桑给巴尔兄弟姊妹们表示衷心的敬意和坚决支持。
    电报说，美帝国主义在桑给巴尔和非洲以及世界各地到处建立军事基地，大举渗入非洲，疯狂地掠夺非洲人民的资源，这进一步暴露了它的侵略和战争阴谋，暴露了它的假和平、真备战的真面目，这些也都说明了美帝国主义是非洲人民和妇女以及世界人民和妇女的最凶恶、最危险的敌人。
    电报指出，桑给巴尔人民反对美帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争不是孤立的，在非洲和全世界爱好和平人民和妇女的同情和支持下，桑给巴尔人民和妇女必将更加紧密地团结起来，对美帝国主义坚持斗争到底，取得反对美帝国主义和反对殖民主义的最后胜利。
    新华社9日讯　中华全国青年联合会8日致电桑给巴尔青年人自己的联盟，全力支持桑给巴尔人民和青年反对美帝国主义阴谋在桑给巴尔建立火箭基地的英勇斗争。
    电报说：“最近，我们兴奋地获悉桑给巴尔五万人民举行大规模示威，抗议美帝国主义阴谋在桑给巴尔建立火箭基地，并将于10日再次举行十万人的大示威，掀起更大的反美斗争风暴。无数事实证明，美帝国主义是一切帝国主义的头子，是非洲人民最凶恶、最危险的敌人，也是全世界人民的死敌。中国青年全力支持桑给巴尔人民和青年反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争，并且深信你们反对帝国主义、争取独立和自由的正义斗争，一定会取得彻底的胜利。”
