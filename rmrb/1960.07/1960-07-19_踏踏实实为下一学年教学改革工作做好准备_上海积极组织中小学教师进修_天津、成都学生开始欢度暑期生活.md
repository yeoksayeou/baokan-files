Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 18th: Party organizations and education administrative departments at all levels in Shanghai are actively organizing in-service training for primary and secondary school teachers, making solid preparations for the next academic year's teaching reform work.

	Next academic year, a number of primary and secondary schools in Shanghai will pilot a new school system and adopt new textbooks. Schools that are not piloting will also improve the current textbooks and teaching methods according to the spirit of teaching reform, in order to gradually improve teaching quality. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this work, Party organizations and educational leadership departments at all levels in Shanghai have strengthened their leadership over teacher training. Responsible cadres of Party organizations and education departments in many districts are personally responsible for teacher training work and have uniformly stipulated the time for in-service teachers to study each week.

	In organizing teacher in-service training, Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai, according to the principle of "teach what is taught, learn what is learned, supplement what is lacking," on the one hand, education administrative departments run various forms of in-service training schools, in-service training classes, and lectures. On the other hand, they organize the vast number of teachers to rely on their own strength to carry out various methods of mass management, mass teaching, and mass learning for in-service training. Now a relatively complete amateur in-service training network has been formed in the city. In Changning, Huangpu, Luwan, Yangpu and other districts where schools are more concentrated, more than 90% of teachers have participated in amateur study. Various in-service training institutions have opened various in-service training classes and lectures according to the different needs of teachers. The Municipal Teachers' In-service Training College has opened seven specialized training classes and eight high school course lectures for high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry teachers who are most urgently in need of remedial training in analytic geometry, inorganic chemistry, etc. The Huangpu District Teachers' Red and Expert College conducted a census of more than 500 primary and secondary schools and vocational schools in the district, and opened 34 types of in-service training classes according to the various needs of teachers. In addition to a group of full-time teachers, most of the teachers in various in-service training institutions are concurrently served by teachers in various schools.

	Each school organizes in-service training groups according to its own needs and possibilities. Some schools take the competent as teachers, and some take the method of collective in-service training, dividing the work to study a course, collective discussion, and giving lectures in turn. Make up for what is lacking, tackle difficulties, learn from each other, and make up for shortcomings, the effect is very good. Some schools take the teaching and research group as a unit, and according to the reform plan, list the problems that they have not mastered thoroughly, and break through them one by one, which has also achieved good results.

	Schools at all levels vigorously carry out cooperation in training teachers. All pilot middle schools in the city are linked to universities, and pilot middle schools have signed cooperation agreements with pilot primary schools, with responsibility at each level and contracting for teacher training.

	Education administrative departments and schools at all levels in Shanghai will hold more in-service training classes and lectures during the summer vacation to help teachers with in-service training. On the premise of ensuring good rest, teachers can choose the courses they need to study according to the principle of voluntariness.

	This newspaper reports: Tianjin primary and secondary school students began a happy and meaningful summer vacation on the 15th.

	Participating in handicraft labor is a feature of this summer vacation. At present, thousands of students have spent their summer "Labor Day". They have participated in handicraft labor in the city's basic construction projects in batches. During the holidays, young students will appropriately participate in handicraft labor in the city's basic construction projects. Each person works for five to seven days, no more than six hours a day. Young pioneers will also participate in some activities within their capabilities of labor and social activities, such as promoting phonetic literacy, participating in the elimination of the four pests, and making toys.

	During the holidays, the city, districts, and schools will carry out various activities to educate students on revolutionary traditions, the three red banners, and the political situation.

	During the holidays, young people and students will widely carry out scientific and technological activities. Nankai District has formulated more than a dozen interesting topics for children, such as "Why does radio make sounds?" Many students have also formed scientific and technological groups such as radio, aviation models, ship models, and meteorology.

	Military sports activities are also a major activity of this year's summer vacation. Militiamen among young students in schools throughout the city are preparing for training.

	This newspaper reports: Chengdu City widely mobilized social forces and comprehensively arranged summer vacation life for children through the people's communes, enabling more than 100,000 children in the city to universally participate in more than 1,000 "Children's Homes" held in various regions and units, and spend a rich and colorful summer vacation.

	The people's communes generally established leading bodies such as the Extracurricular Life Guidance Committee for Children. Many people's communes also held special meetings of cadres, teachers, residents, students, and parents, and used canteens and street gatherings to organize teachers to visit door-to-door, and carried out publicity and mobilization at all levels. According to the residential and educational management of all children in the commune, the urban people's communes properly distributed and arranged the task of organizing summer vacation life for children among all regions and units in the commune. In the suburban people's communes, "Children's Homes" are generally held with the production team canteen as the center, and the management area or school holds the central "Children's Home", which is responsible for carrying out daily and larger-scale activities. At present, the city's Children's Homes have successively carried out five major activities, namely: scientific and technological activities, reading good books activities, eliminating the four pests and talking about hygiene activities; cultural and sports activities; planting activities.

	This newspaper reports: This summer vacation, the lives of students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Shanghai will be more colorful and educational than in any previous year. All schools have made arrangements according to the characteristics of the dispersed vacation activities, relying on the strength of the masses, adapting to local conditions, and making the most of simple conditions to meet the needs of students with various different hobbies and interests as much as possible. In order to support the current industrial and agricultural production, after the start of the holiday, universities and middle schools will organize students to voluntarily participate in a week of labor in the countryside and factories. The middle schools in Huangpu District have been linked with Baoshan County in the suburbs. Healthy male students in the graduating classes of high schools and junior high schools in the district will go to the people's communes to work in batches in rotation. Female students will form small teams and go to the city's nurseries and kindergartens in batches to replace the work of child care workers, so that the child care workers can also have half a month's holiday. Primary school students also participate in some public welfare labor within their capabilities.

	During the summer vacation, all universities, middle schools, and primary schools in the city will conduct military summer camp activities, mainly setting up camps locally. Summer sports activities centered on swimming will also flourish. Schools will also organize students to carry out visits. (Attached picture)

　　天津、成都学生开始欢度暑期生活
    新华社上海18日电　上海市各级党组织和教育行政部门积极组织中小学教师进修，踏踏实实为下一学年的教学改革工作作准备。
    下一学年，上海市将有一批中小学试行新学制，采用新的教材；不作试点的学校，也要根据教学改革的精神，对现行教材、教学方法加以改进，以逐步提高教学质量。为了保证这一工作的顺利进行，上海市各级党组织和教育行政领导部门都加强了对师资培训工作的领导。许多区的党组织和教育部门的负责干部都亲自负责抓教师培训工作，并且统一规定在职教师每周进修学习的时间。
    在组织教师进修培训工作中，上海市各级党组织根据“教什么、学什么、缺什么、补什么”的原则，一方面由教育行政部门举办多种形式的进修学校、进修班和讲座；一方面组织广大教师采取群众办、群众教、群众学多种多样的方法依靠自己力量来进修。现在全市已组成了一个比较完整的业余进修网。学校比较集中的长宁、黄浦、卢湾、杨浦等区，90％以上的教师都参加了业余学习。各业余进修院校分别根据教师不同的需要，开出了各种进修班和讲座。市的教师进修学院，为高中数学、物理、化学教师开出目前最迫切需要补习的解析几何、无机化学等七个专修班和八种高中课程讲座。黄浦区教师红专学院，普查了全区五百多所中小学和业余学校，根据教师的各种需要开办了三十四种进修班。各进修院校除配备有一部分专职教师外，大部分教师由各个学校在职教师兼任。
    各学校根据自己的需要和可能，分别组织了进修小组，有的以能者为师，有的采取集体进修的办法，分工钻研一门课，集体讨论，轮流讲课。有缺就补，有难就攻，互教互学，取长补短，效果很好。有些学校以教研组为单位，按照革新方案，排出自己掌握不透的问题，各个击破，也收到很好的效果。
    各级学校在培养教师中大力开展协作，全市所有试点的中学都和大学挂了钩，试点中学又和试点小学订了协作协议，层层负责，包干培训师资。
    上海市各级教育行政部门和学校将在暑假中举办更多的进修学习班和设立讲座等，帮助教师进修。在保证休息好的前提下，教师们可以根据自愿原则，选择自己需要进修的课程进行学习。
    本报讯　天津中小学生从15日开始了愉快而有意义的暑期生活。

    本报讯　成都市广泛动员社会力量，通过人民公社全面安排少年儿童暑假生活，使全市十多万少年儿童普遍参加到各地区、单位举办的一千多个“少年之家”里，欢度丰富多采的暑假。
    各人民公社一般都成立了少年儿童校外生活指导委员会等领导机构。很多人民公社还分别召开了干部、教师、居民、学生和家长的专门会议，利用食堂和街道集会，组织教师登门拜访，层层进行宣传动员。各城市人民公社根据全社儿童居住和教管情况，把组织少年儿童暑假生活的任务，在全社各地区和各单位间，进行了妥善的分配和安排。在郊区人民公社，则普遍以生产队食堂为中心，举办“少年之家”，管理区或学校举办中心“少年之家”，负责开展日常和较大型的活动。现在，全市各少年之家已相继开展了五大活动，即：科学技术活动，读好书活动，除四害、讲卫生活动；文娱体育活动；种植活动。
    本报讯　今年暑期，上海市大中小学学生生活将比以往任何一年更加丰富多采和富有教育意义。各个学校都根据假期活动分散的特点，依靠群众的力量、因地制宜、因陋就简，尽量满足同学们各种不同爱好、不同兴趣的需要进行了安排。为了支援当前工农业生产，假期开始后，各大中学校将组织学生自愿参加一周下乡、下厂劳动。黄浦区的各中学已经和郊区宝山县挂了钩，全区高、初中毕业班身体健壮的男学生将分批轮流到人民公社劳动。女学生们将组成小队分批轮流到市区各托儿所幼儿园代替保育员工作，让保育员们也过半个月的假期。小学生们也参加一些力所能及的公益劳动。
