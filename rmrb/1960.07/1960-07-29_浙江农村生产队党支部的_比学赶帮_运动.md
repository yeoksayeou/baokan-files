    The rural production team party branch is the fighting bastion of the Party in the countryside. Taking various measures to vigorously improve the leadership level of the Party branch and continuously enhance the Party branch's fighting power is of vital importance for ensuring the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, consolidating and developing the people's commune, and achieving sustained leaps forward in agricultural production.

    In the first half of 1959, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the instruction that the Party's leadership in rural areas must be implemented at the production team level. In accordance with this instruction, various localities sent a group of cadres to the production teams, stipulating that cadres above the level of general branch secretary should specifically contact one branch, which greatly strengthened the Party's leadership over the production team branches. After a period of time, a group of pace-setting production team branches emerged in the branch work evaluation and competition, and various localities adopted methods such as on-site meetings, broadcast meetings, newspaper reports, and compiling small pamphlets to promote their advanced experiences, and launched a mass movement of "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help." At present, this movement is being fully promoted. Among the more than 29,000 production team branches in the province, more than 2,300 pace-setting production team branches have been selected. In the Wenzhou area, more than 5,000 branches out of 9,100 production team branches have formed 1,286 competition networks. In the Jiaxing area, more than 2,200 branches out of 2,700 production team branches have formed 517 competition networks. In many places, there has emerged a competitive upsurge of "Humbly and conscientiously comparing with the advanced, learning every detail of the advanced, seizing every minute to catch up with the advanced, and helping the backward with wholehearted enthusiasm." Practice has proved that carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work is an effective method for continuously improving the leadership level of the branch and enhancing the branch's fighting power.
    
    The Forms of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" Movement

    The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work is the product of the glorious illumination of the general line. The purpose of the movement is to achieve common improvement and continuous leaps forward through mutual learning and mutual assistance. From the perspective of development, the form of the movement has gone through two stages: At the beginning, it was generally a pairwise competition, that is, one branch was linked to another branch to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. For example, the Zhu Village production team branch and the Yanli production team branch in Lin'an County, with contiguous land and the same conditions, Zhu Village's production was good and Yanli's production was poor. After carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement, on the one hand, they chased each other and did not give an inch; on the other hand, they learned from each other and promoted each other. They proposed: "Leave the difficulties to yourself and send the convenience to others." After more than a year, Zhu Village's production has become better and better, and Yanli's production has also jumped from backward to advanced. Later, the movement appeared in the form of a competition network, that is, with the pace-setting production team branch as the core, and the surrounding production team branches were linked to each other to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. For example, the Xiaohaimen, Jingtou, Zhangjiadu, and Huangnidun production teams in Linhai County formed a competition network with the Xiaohaimen production team branch as the core. They proposed: "The advanced does not stay overnight, and the experience is not kept secret," achieving that if one team has advanced, all four teams bloom, and if one team has difficulties, all four teams solve them together. After more than a year, the production of the four teams has jointly leaped forward. In addition to Xiaohaimen, which was originally a pace-setting production team, the other three production teams have also become pace-setters in the commune. Now, many places have combined these two forms. On the one hand, with the pace-setting production team branch as the core, they form a competition network with the surrounding branches; on the other hand, the pace-setting production team branch of the competition network learns from the pace-setting production team branch of the commune, and the pace-setting production team branch of the commune learns from the pace-setting production team branch of the county. This kind of layered connection makes every production team branch have a model to learn from. The combination of these two aspects has powerfully enhanced the fighting power of the branch and promoted the sustained leap forward of various tasks more quickly.

    How to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in a competition network, various localities have created many methods, which are concentrated in mutual assistance and mutual promotion politically, organizationally, and materially. For example, branch secretaries often meet to exchange information and introduce experience; mutually send party members to attend branch committee meetings or party member meetings to exchange information and learn from each other's strengths; according to the tasks arranged by the higher authorities, propose targets, arrange measures, carry out competitions, and compare high and low; establish models in all walks of life, mobilize the masses to learn from the models, or send the models to various places to deliver treasures; hold party schools with the competition network as the unit, concentrate party members to attend party lessons, and provide mutual support in materials and manpower according to the principle of "equivalent exchange," and so on. For example, the Shuangyi, Shuang'er, and Shuangsan production team branches of the Dipu Commune in Anji County formed a competition network with the Shuangyi team branch as the core. The Shuangsan team branch did not pay attention to grasping ideology in its work, and did not carry out struggles against the capitalist activities of some wealthy middle peasants. The Shuangyi team branch gave them ideas and taught them how to improve organizational life, establish a party class system, and conduct criticism and self-criticism regularly. At the same time, they taught them to carry out socialist and communist education among the members and criticize capitalist ideas to improve the class consciousness of the broad masses. The Shuangsan team branch only grasped rice production and not diversified operations in production. The Shuangyi team branch also helped them come up with ideas, taught them to open up mountains to cultivate forests, plant fruit trees on a large scale, and comprehensively develop production. They not only helped each other politically and organizationally, but also materially. For example, when planting early rice and expanding the planting of miscellaneous grains, the Shuang'er team knew that the Shuangyi team lacked seeds and seedlings and was progressing slowly, so they sent eighteen members with five mu of seedlings and seven catties of sorghum seeds to support the Shuangyi team. The Shuangyi team knew that the Shuang'er team wanted to set up a factory, so they sent technicians to draw designs and introduce experience. The Shuangyi team and the Shuang'er team knew that the Shuangsan team lacked fertilizer, so they organized labor to apply their best fertilizer to the backward fields of the Shuangsan team. They said well: "It is not good to complete the task by yourself, it is good to complete the task together."

    The Characteristics of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" Movement

    The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work is the improvement and development of the evaluation and competition movement in branch work. Carrying out evaluation and competition in branch work has played a great role in improving the leadership level of the branch, stimulating the revolutionary enthusiasm of party members, and promoting the great leap forward in production. However, compared with the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work, it still has its imperfections. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work has the following characteristics:

    First, some of the conditions for the evaluation and competition movement in branch work are relatively empty, such as "comparing political command," "comparing collective leadership," "comparing party spirit," "comparing enthusiasm," and so on. These conditions are invisible and intangible, which can easily make the evaluation and competition become a formality. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work takes the advanced deeds and experiences of the pace-setting production team party branch as a model for learning, with clear goals, specific content, visible, and tangible, just as some comrades said: "It is not surprising if you don't see it, you can see the difference when you see it," "You can see it, you can hear it, the more you see it, the more you listen to it, the more energetic you become." In this way, the movement has a broad mass base and can be carried out in a down-to-earth manner.

    Second, although the evaluation and competition movement in branch work also requires combining with production and central work, because the evaluation conditions focus on political work and are not linked to the evaluation and competition in production, there is one set inside the party and another set outside the party, and it is not easy to combine politics and production well. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work starts from production and central work. Where production and central work are done well, it is established as a model, and their leadership experience is summarized and promoted to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. In this way, the evaluation and competition within the party are combined with the central work of the party committee; the strengthening of the ideological and organizational construction of the branch is combined with the implementation of the party's political tasks.

    Third, the evaluation and competition movement in branch work focuses on "catching up," emphasizing "winning the red flag" and "striving for the first," and not enough emphasis is placed on mutual learning and mutual assistance to promote common progress. Therefore, the movement is prone to parochialism and trophyism, such as mutual disapproval during evaluation, understatement of the advanced, clinging to the backward, and even individual cases of fraud. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work not only emphasizes "catching up" but also emphasizes "helping," requiring everyone to carry forward the communist spirit of "leaving the difficulties to oneself and sending the convenience to others," which effectively prevents and overcomes capitalist ideas and behaviors in the competition, thereby greatly improving the relationship between the party and the masses, between the masses and the masses, and promoting the common leap forward of various tasks.

    Fourth, the conditions for the evaluation and competition movement in branch work are relatively fixed and the requirements are relatively high, such as what "ten good branches" and "eight good party members," etc. Generally speaking, it is not easy for most branches to achieve. The evaluation conditions of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work are completely linked to production and central work. What production and central work are grasping, the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement is doing. It does not require "perfection" or everything to be good. As long as there are outstanding achievements in a certain task, it can be established as a model for this task and carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. Because production and central work come one after another, and the inventions and creations of the masses are endless, the content of "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" is constantly developing and improving. In mutual learning, each branch can also develop its local experience into more comprehensive experience.

    The Role of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" Movement

    The widespread, in-depth, and sustained development of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work has a very significant role in improving the communist awareness of party members and the masses, improving the leadership methods of the branch, and ensuring the sustained leap forward in production.

    After carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work, the communist awareness of party members and the masses has been greatly improved. In the movement, advanced things appear one after another, which can overcome the pride and right-leaning thoughts of party members and the masses, and prompt them to break superstitions, liberate their minds, muster their energy, and strive for the top. For example, advanced units look forward, "There is a sky outside the sky," "There is a building outside the building," and realize that they are still inferior to others; looking backward, backward units are catching up quickly and catching up with themselves. This prompts them to overcome complacency, establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution, muster their energy, and strive to make the advanced even more advanced. For example, backward units, on the one hand, see the thriving new atmosphere of advanced units and learn the specific methods of turning backward into advanced; on the other hand, they see strong support from all aspects. This prompts them to overcome right-leaning and fear-of-difficulty thoughts, establish lofty ambitions, strive for self-improvement, and strive to accelerate the elimination of backwardness and catch up with the advanced level. In the movement, the communist spirit of cooperation has also been greatly promoted. Everyone helps where there is difficulty, and one flower blooms and ten thousand trees turn red. For example, the Yangdu, Gangyao, and Chaibudu production team branches of the Chengxi Commune in Linhai County formed a competition network. When planting early rice, the Yangdu team lacked seedlings, and the Gangyao team branch immediately mobilized its members to save seedlings and support the Yangdu team. The Chaibudu team branch also pulled out more than 30 laborers, went to the fields to pull seedlings at one o'clock in the middle of the night, and sent the seedlings to Yangdu in the morning to help them make a sudden rush for a day. The 148 mu of early rice in the Yangdu production team were all completed according to plan. The 19 competition networks in this commune conducted a major evaluation in mid-April, and a total of 4,251 outstanding members were selected, accounting for 27.4% of the total labor force.

    After carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work, the Party's leadership over the production team branches has been effectively strengthened. To do a good job in this movement, it is necessary to do a series of ideological and organizational work. Such as constantly grasping the advanced, establishing models, organizing linked competitions; regularly holding working meetings of the pace-setting production team party branch, summarizing and promoting advanced experience; taking various specific measures to help backward units catch up with advanced units, and so on. In this way, the Party's branch work naturally comes to the agenda of the Party committee. Since the launch of the movement, many Party committees have designated a secretary to grasp branch work. They personally hold meetings, listen to reports, summarize experience, and provide specific guidance. Some also stipulate that each Party committee member who manages rural work must be implemented in a pace-setting production team party branch to implement various tasks, first making a model in the point they are in contact with, and then promoting it. This approach not only effectively overcomes bureaucracy in work and enriches leadership experience, but also greatly strengthens the Party's leadership over the branch and promotes the successful completion of various tasks. A Party committee secretary of the Xiaoshe Commune in Anji County said: Last year, when engaging in the purchase task, he did not give play to the organizational role of the branch, and only found cadres to come up to hold meetings, and the leadership was very difficult. This year, he grasped the branch and vigorously engaged in "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help," and the task was completed in three days. Similarly, the branches also reflected that after carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement, the work was easier to do. A branch secretary said: In the past, when the management area arranged tasks, they did not know what to do when they went back. Now that they have a competition network, when the task comes down, several branches first discuss it, introduce experience if they have it, help if they have difficulties, and then engage in a competition movement, and the work is done quickly, well, and economically.

    After carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work, the advanced are promoted to become even more advanced, and the backward are transformed into advanced, which powerfully promotes the sustained leap forward in production. For example, the Zhu Village and Yanli production teams mentioned earlier. In 1958, the grain yield per mu in Zhu Village was 832 catties, and 880 pigs were raised, while the grain yield per mu in Yanli was only 660 catties, and only 296 pigs were raised. After carrying out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement, the two teams achieved common leaps forward. In 1959, the grain yield per mu in Zhu Village was 1,394 catties, an increase of 68% compared to 1958; 1,420 pigs were raised, an increase of 61% compared to 1958. The grain yield per mu in Yanli was 1,300 catties, and 590 pigs were raised, which was almost doubled compared to 1958. Now, the Yanli production team has not only changed from a backward team to an advanced team, but it has also become the core of another competition network. After several months of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement, the production and work of the other three teams in this competition network have developed rapidly. Countless facts prove that as long as the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work is carried out conscientiously, the work in all aspects will definitely be able to continue to leap forward.

    The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work also has a more profound and positive significance. As the movement is carried out widely, deeply, and persistently, people's communist ideas will definitely continue to improve, people's mutual relations will definitely become closer, and social productive forces will definitely develop greatly; and promote teams with relatively low production and income levels to accelerate catching up with teams with relatively high production and income levels. This will create good ideological, organizational, and material conditions for the consolidation and development of rural people's communes.

    Some Experiences in Leading the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" Movement

    From the initial experience of various localities, to do a good job in the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work, the following tasks should be grasped well:

    First, strengthen political and ideological leadership. Politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul. Only by strengthening political and ideological leadership can we ensure that the movement proceeds healthily. In the movement, communist education for party members and the masses should be continuously strengthened, and the purpose and significance of the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement should be explained to them. Advanced units should be educated to recognize the favorable situation of sustained leaps forward, and not to be arrogant and complacent because they have made some achievements, thinking that they have "leapt to the top" and can "stay at the top," prompting them to establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution. At the same time, they should be educated to understand that one flower blooming alone is not spring, but a hundred flowers blooming in a riot of color is spring, and helping backward units catch up with the advanced is the obligation and responsibility of every member in the socialist family, prompting them to carry forward the communist spirit of "leaving the difficulties to oneself and sending the convenience to others." Backward units should be educated to recognize the direction, and not to be afraid of difficulties and stop moving forward because their work is backward for a while, only seeing unfavorable conditions and not seeing favorable conditions, prompting them to establish lofty ambitions, muster their energy, and strive for the top. At the same time, they should be educated to understand that if they do not overcome difficulties in every possible way and only reach out to ask others for help, this is the worldview of cowards and lazy people. Only by fully exerting their subjective initiative can they continue to advance victoriously, prompting them to establish the idea of ​​self-reliance to accelerate the change of their backward situation. Regularly paying attention to the ideological trends in the movement and vigorously strengthening political and ideological work in this regard can ensure that the movement moves in the correct direction.

    Second, engage in mass movements on a large scale. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work is a good form of mass movement and an effective method for implementing the mass line. When the masses are fully mobilized, they can generate great material strength. Facts prove that where the masses are well mobilized, the movement is booming; where the masses are not well mobilized, the movement becomes a formality, "noisy on stage, deserted off stage," and cannot last. How to fully mobilize the masses, from the initial experience of various localities, mainly grasp the following points: First, vigorously grasp the advanced and establish models. In the movement, models should be established at all levels and in all things. There should be both collective models and individual models; there should be both comprehensive models and individual models, so that there are specific goals for struggle in all walks of life, all teams, and all people. In this way, it is possible to continuously stimulate the enthusiasm of party members and the masses to implement the general line, encourage their vigorous fighting spirit, and form a competitive upsurge of "everyone compares, everyone learns, everyone catches up, and everyone helps." Second, carry out linked competitions. In the competition, the masses should be let go to mobilize from beginning to end to prevent the leadership from taking over. Such as whether to "compare, learn, catch up, and help," whether it is possible to "compare, learn, catch up, and help," and with what team and what person to link up with the competition. These issues should be debated in the party and outside the party so that the movement is built on the basis of the masses' consciousness. When organizing the link-up, not only should the party branch link up with the party branch; under the leadership of the party branch, the Youth League branch should link up with the Youth League branch, the Women's Federation with the Women's Federation, the militia with the militia, the canteen with the canteen, all the way to the individual and the individual. Only by organizing every unit and every person into the movement can we form a competitive upsurge of "everyone catching up with the advanced and striving for the top in everything." Third, carry out mass inspection and evaluation. After a period of competition, the party branch work should be evaluated in combination with the central work or the production season, starting from the inspection of the central work and production. The process of inspection and evaluation is a process of further mobilizing the masses, and the masses should be allowed to use their own hands and mouths. This can make the inspection conscientious, the evaluation fair, and help to educate the masses, so that the movement can be carried out in one wave after another.

    Third, take production as the center. The "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work should take production and central work as the main content. What production and central work are grasping, the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" is doing. At present, there are generally two ways of doing this: One is to establish models, hold on-site meetings, and promote advanced experience according to the requirements of production and central work, and then put forward requirements and practices for the branch to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. If the center grasps tool reform, it will establish a tool reform model; if the center grasps running collective welfare undertakings well, it will establish a collective welfare undertaking model; if the center implements diligence and thrift in running the commune, it will establish a diligence and thrift model. Take the model as the banner and organize the branch to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. Another way is to put forward a period of struggle goals according to the requirements of production and central work, and check and evaluate them on schedule. After the inspection and evaluation, new struggle goals are put forward according to the requirements of the next production and central work. For example, when sowing early rice, focus on cultivating strong seedlings, when transplanting, focus on ensuring area, density, and season, and after transplanting, focus on doing a good job in field management, and put forward specific requirements respectively, calling on the branch to carry out the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement. Each stage organizes an inspection and evaluation, and then puts forward new indicators. These two methods are usually combined. Because production tasks and central work come one after another, the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement can also be carried out one link after another.

    Fourth, strengthen organizational leadership. Strengthening organizational leadership is an important guarantee for making the movement wide, deep, and persistent. The county party committee and the commune party committee should take various measures to continuously improve the level of the model and help backward units catch up with the advanced. Such as having leading comrades implement the pace-setting production team branch, participate in production, lead production, and specifically help them improve their working methods and promote their advanced experience; such as regularly holding forums for party members, listening to their reflections, asking them about the situation of the movement, helping them improve their understanding, solve difficulties, and encourage them to move forward; such as holding training classes to train branch backbones well, and constantly improve their ideological level and leadership level; such as using newspapers, periodicals, radio, conferences, and publicizing the dynamics and experience of the pace-setting production team party branch on a large scale; such as holding working meetings of the pace-setting production team party branch, organizing model units to visit each other, sending treasures to learn from, helping them overcome complacency, and firmly establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution, and so on.

    Over the past year or so, we have accumulated some experience in the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help" movement in branch work; however, this experience is still very superficial, and there are many areas that need to be improved and improved. Moreover, the development of the movement is still very uneven. In some places, the masses have not been fully mobilized, and some competition networks are still a formality. These problems need to be solved one by one.

    浙江农村生产队党支部的“比学赶帮”运动
    郑平
    农村生产队党支部，是党在农村中的战斗堡垒。采取各种措施，大力提高党支部的领导水平，不断增强党支部的战斗力，对于保证贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，巩固和发展人民公社，实现农业生产的持续跃进，有十分重大的作用。
    1959年上半年，省委提出了农村党的领导必须落实到生产队的指示。各地根据这个指示，下放了一批干部到生产队，规定总支书记以上干部要具体联系一个支部，这就使党对生产队支部的领导大大加强了。经过一段时间，在支部工作评比竞赛中，涌现了一批标兵生产队支部，各地采取现场会、广播会、登报、编小册子等等办法，推广了他们的先进经验，并且开展了“比学赶帮”的群众运动。目前，这个运动正在全面推开。全省二万九千多个生产队支部中，共评出标兵生产队支部二千三百多个；温州地区九千一百个生产队支部，已有五千多个支部组成了一千二百八十六个竞赛网；嘉兴地区二千七百个生产队支部，已有二千二百多个支部组成了五百一十七个竞赛网。不少地方，出现了“比先进虚心认真，学先进点滴不漏，赶先进分秒必争，帮后进满腔热情”的竞赛高潮。实践证明：开展支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是不断提高支部领导水平、增强支部战斗力的有效方法。
    “比学赶帮”运动的形式
    支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是总路线光辉照耀下的产物。运动的目的，是通过互学互帮，互相促进，达到共同提高，不断跃进。运动的形式，从发展来看，经过两个阶段：开始的时候，普遍是对口竞赛，也就是一个支部同另一个支部挂起钩来，开展“比学赶帮”运动。如临安县朱村生产队支部和研里生产队支部，土地连片，条件相同，两个队比较起来，朱村的生产好，研里的生产差，开展“比学赶帮”运动以后，一方面你追我赶，寸步不让；一方面互学互帮，共同促进。他们提出：“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”。经过一年多时间，朱村的生产愈来愈好，研里的生产也从后进跃到先进。后来，运动出现了竞赛网的形式，也就是以标兵生产队支部为核心，同周围的生产队支部互相挂钩，开展“比学赶帮”运动。如临海县小海门、井头、张家渡、黄泥墩四个生产队，以小海门生产队支部为核心，组成一个竞赛网。他们提出了：“先进不过夜，经验不保守”，做到了一队有先进，四队齐开花，一队有困难，四队同解决。经过一年多时间，四个队的生产共同跃进，除了小海门本来就是标兵生产队以外，另外三个生产队也都成了公社的标兵。现在，不少地方把这两种形式结合起来了，一方面，以标兵生产队支部为核心，同周围的支部结成竞赛网；另一方面，竞赛网的标兵生产队支部向公社的标兵生产队支部学习，而公社的标兵生产队支部又向县的标兵生产队支部学习。这样层层串连，就使得每一个生产队支部都有学习的榜样。这两方面结合起来，就有力地增强了支部的战斗力，更快地促进了各项工作的持续跃进。
    在一个竞赛网内怎样开展“比学赶帮”运动，各地创造了很多方法，集中起来，就是从政治上、组织上、物质上互相帮助，互相促进。如支部书记经常碰头，交流情况，介绍经验；互相派党员列席支委会或者党员大会，互通消息，取长补短；根据上级布置的任务，提指标，摆措施，搞竞赛，比高低；树立各行各业的标兵，发动群众到标兵那里去取经，或者派标兵到各处去送宝；以竞赛网为单位举办党校，集中党员上党课，根据“等价交换”的原则，在物资上、人力上相互支援，等等。例如，安吉县递铺公社双一、双二、双三等三个生产队支部，以双一队支部为核心，组成了一个竞赛网。双三队支部在工作中不注意抓思想，对于一部分富裕中农的资本主义活动，也没有开展斗争；双一队支部就给他们出点子，教他们健全组织生活，建立党课制度，经常开展批评和自我批评。同时，教他们在社员中进行社会主义和共产主义教育，批判资本主义思想，来提高广大群众的阶级觉悟。双三队支部在生产上只抓水稻，不抓多种经营；双一队支部又帮他们出主意，教他们辟山育林，大栽果木，全面发展生产。他们之间，不但在政治上、组织上相互帮助，在物质上也同样相互支援。比如，早稻插秧和扩种杂粮时，双二队知道双一队缺种、缺秧，进度很慢，就派了十八个社员，带了五亩秧苗和七斤高粱种去支援双一队；双一队知道双二队要办工厂，就派技术员去绘图设计，介绍经验；双一队和双二队知道双三队缺少肥料，就组织劳动力把自己最好的肥料施到双三队的落后畈里去。他们说得好：“光自己完成任务不算好，要大家完成任务才算好”。
    “比学赶帮”运动的特点
    支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是支部工作评比竞赛运动的提高和发展。开展支部工作评比竞赛，对于提高支部的领导水平，激发党员的革命积极性，促进生产的大跃进，起了很大的作用。但是，同支部工作“比学赶帮”运动比较起来，还有它不完善的地方。支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，有这样一些特点：
    第一、支部工作的评比竞赛运动，有些条件比较空洞，如“比政治挂帅”，“比集体领导”，“比党性”，“比干劲”，等等。这些条件，看不见，摸不着，容易使评比竞赛流于形式。而支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是以标兵生产队党支部的先进事迹和经验为学习榜样，目标明确，内容具体，看得见，摸得到，真像有的同志讲的：“不看不稀奇，一看见高低”，“看得见，听得进，越看越听越有劲”。这样，运动就有广泛的群众基础，就能够踏踏实实地开展下去。
    第二、支部工作的评比竞赛运动，虽然也要求同生产和中心工作结合起来，但是，因为评比条件着重放在政治工作方面，而且没有同生产上的评比竞赛挂起钩来，因此，党内一套，党外一套，政治与生产不容易结合得好。而支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是从生产和中心工作入手，那里生产和中心工作搞得好，就立那里为标兵，总结和推广他们的领导经验，开展“比学赶帮”运动。这样，就把党内的评比竞赛同党委的中心工作结合了起来；把加强支部的思想建设、组织建设同贯彻执行党的政治任务结合了起来。
    第三、支部工作的评比竞赛运动，重点是“赶”，着重强调“夺红旗”，“争第一”，对于互学互帮，共同促进，则强调不够。因此，运动中容易产生本位主义和锦标主义，如评比时互不服气，看到先进轻描淡写，碰到落后抓住不放，个别的甚至弄虚作假。而支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，不仅强调“赶”，而且强调“帮”，要求大家发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的共产主义精神，这就有效地防止和克服了竞赛中的资本主义思想和行为，从而大大改善了党和群众之间、群众和群众之间的关系，促进了各项工作的共同跃进。
    第四、支部工作的评比竞赛运动，条件比较固定，而且要求也比较高，如什么“十好支部”、“八好党员”等等，一般说来，大多数支部都不容易办到。而支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，评比条件完全同生产和中心工作拧在一起，生产和中心工作抓什么，“比学赶帮”运动就搞什么，而且并不要求“十全十美”，样样都好；只要在某项工作中有出色的成绩，就可以立为这项工作的标兵，开展“比学赶帮”运动。由于生产和中心工作一个接一个，群众的发明创造又无穷无尽，“比学赶帮”的内容，也就不断发展，不断提高，各个支部在互相学习中，也就可以把自己的局部经验，发展成为比较全面的经验。
    “比学赶帮”运动的作用
    广泛、深入、持久地开展支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，对于提高党员和群众的共产主义觉悟，改进支部的领导方法，保证生产的持续跃进，有十分显著的作用。
    开展支部工作“比学赶帮”运动以后，大大地提高了党员和群众的共产主义觉悟。在运动中，先进事物一个接一个出现，就能够克服党员和群众的骄傲情绪和右倾思想，促使他们破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游。如先进单位，他们向前看，“天外有天”，“楼外有楼”，认识到自己还有不如人家的地方；向后看，后进单位在急起直追，猛赶自己。这就促使他们克服自满情绪，树立不断革命的思想，鼓足干劲，争取先进更先进。如后进单位，一方面，看到了先进单位欣欣向荣的新气象，学到了后进变先进的具体办法；另一方面，又看到有各方面的大力支持。这就促使他们克服右倾畏难思想，树立雄心大志，奋发图强，争取加快摆脱落后面貌，赶上先进水平。在运动中，共产主义的协作精神，也大大发扬了。一处困难大家帮，一树花开万树红。如临海县城西公社杨杜、缸窑、柴埠渡三个生产队支部，组成一个竞赛网。早稻插秧时，杨杜队缺少秧苗，缸窑队支部马上动员社员节省秧苗，支援杨杜队；柴埠渡队支部又抽出三十多个劳力，半夜一点钟下田拔秧，天亮将秧苗送到杨杜，帮助他们突击插了一天。杨杜生产队的一百四十八亩早稻，就全部按计划完成插秧任务。这个公社十九个竞赛网，在4月中旬进行了一次大评比，共评出优秀社员四千二百五十一名，占劳动力总数的27.4％。
    开展支部工作“比学赶帮”运动以后，切实地加强了党对生产队支部的领导。要搞好这个运动，需要做一连串的思想工作和组织工作。如不断地抓先进，立标兵，组织挂钩竞赛；经常召开标兵生产队党支部工作会议，总结和推广先进经验；采取各种具体措施，帮助后进单位赶上先进单位，等等。这样，党的支部工作就自然地提到党委的议事日程上来了。我们从开展运动以来，不少党委都指定了一个书记抓支部工作，他们亲自开会，听汇报，总结经验，具体指导；有的还规定每个管理农村工作的党委委员，都要落实到一个标兵生产队党支部去，贯彻各项任务，先在自己联系的这个点里做出样子，然后再去推广。这种作法，不仅有效地克服了工作中的官僚主义，丰富了领导经验，而且大大地加强了党对支部的领导，推动了各项任务的胜利完成。安吉县晓墅公社有个党委书记说：去年搞征购任务，不去发挥支部的组织作用，光找干部上来开会，领导很吃力；今年抓支部，大搞“比学赶帮”，任务三天就完成了。同样，支部也反映，开展“比学赶帮”运动以后，工作好做了。有个支部书记说：过去，管理区布置了任务，回去怎么办，心里没有数，现在搞了竞赛网，任务一下来，几个支部先商量商量，有经验就介绍，有困难就帮助，再来一个竞赛运动，工作就干得多快好省。
    开展支部工作“比学赶帮”运动以后，促进了先进更先进，后进变先进，有力地推动了生产的持续跃进。如前面讲的朱村和研里两个生产队，1958年，朱村粮食亩产八百三十二斤，养猪八百八十头，而研里粮食亩产只有六百六十斤，养猪只有二百九十六头。开展“比学赶帮”运动以后，两个队得到了共同跃进。1959年，朱村粮食亩产一千三百九十四斤，比1958年增加68％；养猪一千四百二十头，比1958年增加61％。研里粮食亩产一千三百斤，养猪五百九十头，同1958年比较，都将近翻了一番。现在，研里生产队不但已经由后进队变为先进队，而且它已经成为另一个竞赛网的核心；经过几个月的“比学赶帮”运动，这个竞赛网内的另外三个队的生产和工作，都有了很快的发展。无数事实证明，只要认真地开展支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，各方面的工作就一定能够持续跃进。
    开展支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，还有它更加深远的积极意义。随着运动广泛、深入、持久地开展下去，人们的共产主义思想一定会不断提高，人们的相互关系一定会日益密切，社会生产力一定会大大发展；并且促使生产水平、收入水平比较低的队，加快赶上生产水平、收入水平比较高的队。这就能为农村人民公社的巩固和发展创造了思想上、组织上和物质上的良好条件。
    领导“比学赶帮”运动的几点体会
    从各地的初步经验来看，要搞好支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，应当抓好下面几项工作：
    第一、加强政治思想领导。政治是统帅，思想是灵魂，只有加强政治思想领导，才能保证运动健康地进行。在运动中，应当不断地加强对党员和群众的共产主义教育，向他们讲清楚“比学赶帮”运动的目的和意义。要教育先进单位认清持续跃进的有利形势，不能因为有了一点成绩就骄傲自满，认为已经“跃进到顶”，可以“稳居上游”，促使他们树立不断革命的思想；同时，要教育他们懂得：一花独开不是春，万紫千红才是春，帮助后进单位赶上先进，这是社会主义大家庭中每一个成员的义务和职责，促使他们发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的共产主义精神。要教育后进单位认清方向，不能因为一时工作落后就畏难不前，只看到不利条件，看不到有利条件，促使他们树立雄心大志，鼓足干劲，力争上游；同时，要教育他们懂得：自己不千方百计克服困难，光伸手要别人帮助，这是懦夫和懒汉的世界观，只有充分发挥自己的主观能动性，才能不断胜利前进，促使他们树立自力更生的思想，来加快改变自己的落后面貌。经常注意运动中的思想动向，大力加强这方面的政治思想工作，就能够保证运动沿着正确的方向前进。
    第二、要大搞群众运动。支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，是群众运动的一种良好形式，也是贯彻执行群众路线的有效方法。群众充分发动起来了，就能产生伟大的物质力量。事实证明：那里群众发动得好，那里运动就轰轰烈烈；那里群众发动得不好，那里运动就流于形式，“上台闹哄哄，下台冷清清”，不能持久下去。如何充分发动群众，从各地的初步经验来看，主要抓住这样几条：一是大抓先进，大立标兵。在运动中，要层层立标兵，事事立标兵，既有集体标兵，又有个人标兵；既有全面标兵，又有单项标兵，做到红旗成林，标兵成网，使得各行、各业、各队、各人，都有具体的奋斗目标。这样，就能够不断地激发党员和群众贯彻总路线的积极性，鼓舞他们的旺盛斗志，形成“人人比，人人学，人人赶，人人帮”的竞赛高潮。二是开展挂钩竞赛。竞赛中，应当自始至终放手发动群众，防止领导包办代替。如要不要“比学赶帮”，能不能“比学赶帮”，同什么队、什么人挂钩竞赛。这些问题，都应当在党内和党外大鸣大放大辩论，把运动建筑在群众自觉的基础上。在组织挂钩的时候，不但党支部与党支部要挂钩；在党支部的领导下，团支部与团支部、妇联与妇联、民兵与民兵、食堂与食堂，一直到个人与个人，都应当挂起钩来。只有把每一个单位、每一个人都组织到运动中去，才能够形成一个“人人赶先进、事事争上游”的竞赛热潮。三是开展群众性的检查评比。经过一段时期的竞赛，应当结合中心工作或者生产季节，从检查中心工作和生产入手，来评比党的支部工作。检查评比的过程是进一步发动群众的过程，应当让群众自己动手动口。这就可以使检查认真，评比公道，并有利于教育群众，使运动一浪高一浪地开展下去。
    第三、要以生产为中心。支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动，应当以生产和中心工作为主要内容，生产和中心工作抓什么，“比学赶帮”就搞什么。目前，一般有两种作法：一种是根据生产和中心工作的要求，树立标兵，开现场会，推广先进经验，然后对支部提出要求和做法，开展“比学赶帮”运动。如中心抓工具改革，就立工具改革的标兵；中心抓办好集体福利事业，就立集体福利事业的标兵；中心贯彻勤俭办社，就立勤俭办社的标兵。以标兵为旗帜，组织支部开展“比学赶帮”运动。另一种作法是根据生产和中心工作的要求，提出一个时期的奋斗目标，按期检查评比；检查评比以后，根据下一个生产和中心工作的要求，再提出新的奋斗目标。如早稻播种时以培育壮秧为中心，插秧时以保面积、保密植、保季节为中心，插秧结束后以搞好田间管理为中心，分别提出具体要求，号召支部开展“比学赶帮”运动，每一阶段组织一次检查评比，然后提出新的指标。这两种方法，通常都是结合进行的。由于生产任务和中心工作一个接一个，“比学赶帮”运动也就能够一环扣一环地开展下去。
    第四、要加强组织领导。加强组织领导是使运动广泛、深入、持久地开展下去的重要保证。县委和公社党委应当采取各种措施，来不断地提高标兵的水平，并帮助后进单位赶上先进。如由领导同志落实到标兵生产队支部，参加生产，领导生产，具体帮助他们改进工作方法，推广他们的先进经验；如经常召开党员座谈会，听听他们的反映，问问他们关于运动的情况，帮助他们提高认识，解决困难，鼓励他们不断前进；如举办训练班，训练好支部骨干，不断地提高他们的思想水平和领导水平；如利用报纸、刊物、广播、会议、大张旗鼓地介绍标兵生产队党支部的动态和经验；如召开标兵生产队党支部工作会议，组织标兵单位互相参观，送宝取经，帮助他们克服自满情绪，坚定不断革命的思想，等等。
    一年多来，我们在支部工作的“比学赶帮”运动方面，虽然已经积累了一些经验；但是，这些经验还非常粗浅，有许多地方需要改进和提高。而且，运动开展得也还很不平衡，有些地方群众还没有充分发动起来，有些竞赛网还流于形式。这些问题，都需要逐个加以解决。
