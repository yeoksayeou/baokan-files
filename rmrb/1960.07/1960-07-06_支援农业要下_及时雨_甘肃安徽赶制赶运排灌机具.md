Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 4th: Industrial and commercial departments in Gansu Province are rushing to produce and transport agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery to support agricultural production and the fight against drought.

During the first and second quarters of this year, industrial departments in Gansu Province have listed the production of irrigation and drainage machinery as a primary task, carrying out comprehensive crash production. As of June 15, the province produced 39,987 meters of cast iron pipe, totaling 2,354.6 tons, and 147,205 meters of rubber hose, accounting for 173.18% of the annual plan. Commercial departments have also transported 1,181 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, including diesel engines, boiler engines, and gas engines, with a total of 42,888 horsepower, from Shanghai and other places.

Because workers have established the idea of comprehensively and continuously supporting agricultural production, they have brought their subjective initiative into play and overcome various difficulties in every possible way during production. Many factories had not produced cast iron pipes in the past. When they started production, the rejection rate of some factories was as high as about 80%. Workers improved the sand casting technology, and the rejection rate dropped to below 10%.

At present, the Lanzhou Agricultural Machinery Supply Station of the Provincial Department of Commerce is vigorously coordinating the allocation and transportation of irrigation and drainage machinery in order to quickly transport a large number of these machines to the countryside. As of June 28, 1,130 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, totaling 40,513 horsepower, have been transported to the countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 4th: Since the beginning of this year, the mechanical industry departments in Anhui Province have rushed to manufacture and repair a large number of agricultural machines and tools for irrigation and drainage, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and processing for the countryside. According to statistics up to June 20, the province manufactured 816 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery this year, totaling 22,952 horsepower, completing 50.16% of the annual plan; 3,231 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery were repaired, totaling 63,020 horsepower, accounting for 73.2% of the total number needing repair. In addition, hundreds of thousands of various waterwheels, sowing tools, rice transplanters, improved harvesters, as well as a large number of threshing machines and processing machinery, were manufactured.

After these agricultural machines were put into production, they not only played an important role in drought resistance and irrigation, but also achieved great results in saving labor and reducing labor intensity. The Wuhu Special District used irrigation and drainage machinery with a total of 16,000 horsepower to drain water from 560,000 mu of waterlogged farmland within ten days. Although the area of summer harvest crops in the province this year has expanded by about 25% compared with last year, thanks to the use of a large number of simple harvesters and disc harvesters, the harvest work in southern and northern Anhui was completed in only about ten days, five or six days shorter than last year, saving a large amount of labor.

Party organizations at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to the work of industry supporting agriculture. As early as March of this year, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee designated the machinery and transportation departments to draw cadres to establish an irrigation and drainage equipment office; local party committees and municipal party committees also established agricultural machinery leading groups headed by secretaries to strengthen the leadership of supporting agriculture.

### 支援农业要下“及时雨”  甘肃安徽赶制赶运排灌机具

    支援农业要下“及时雨”
    甘肃安徽赶制赶运排灌机具
    据新华社兰州4日电　甘肃省工业、商业等部门正在赶制和调运农业排灌机具，支援农业生产和抗旱斗争。
    今年一、二季度，甘肃省各工业部门都把排灌机具的生产列为主要任务，全面突击制造。截至6月15日，全省生产的铸铁管达三万九千九百八十七米、二千三百五十四点六吨；胶皮管十四万七千二百零五米，为年计划的173.18％。商业部门也从上海等地运来柴油机、锅驼机、煤气机等排灌机械一千一百八十一台，共有四万二千八百八十八马力。
    由于职工们树立了全面、长期支援农业生产的思想，在生产中发挥了主观能动性，千方百计地克服各种困难。很多厂过去没有生产过铸铁管，开始生产时，有的厂废品率竟达80％左右。工人们改进了翻砂技术，废品率下降到10％以下。
    目前，省商业厅兰州农业机械供应站正在大抓排灌机具的配套调运，以便把大批排灌机具迅速运往农村。截至6月28日，运往农村的排灌机械有一千一百三十台，共四万零五百一十三马力。
    据新华社合肥4日电　安徽省机械工业部门今年以来为农村赶制和修理了大批排灌、播种、收割、脱粒、加工等农业机械和工具。据到6月20日的统计，全省今年制造的排灌机械已达八百一十六台、二万二千九百五十二马力，完成全年计划50.16％；修好的排灌机械三千二百三十一台、六万三千零二十马力，占需要修理总数的73.2％。另外还制造了几十万部（件）各种水车、播种工具、插秧机、改良收割器，以及大量脱粒机具和加工机械。
    这些农业机具投入生产以后，不仅在抗旱、排灌中发挥了重要作用，而且在节约劳力、降低劳动强度方面，收到了很大效果。芜湖专区使用了总数为一万六千马力的排灌机械，十天之内即排出了五十六万亩受涝农田的水。全省今年夏收作物面积虽比去年扩大25％左右，但由于使用大批简易收割机、圆盘收割器等收割机具，皖南、皖北地区只十天左右就完成了收割工作，比去年缩短五、六天，并节约了大批劳力。
    安徽省各级党组织对工业支援农业的工作都非常重视。中共安徽省委早在今年3月份就指定机械、交通等部门抽调干部成立排灌设备办公室；各地委、市委也分别由书记挂帅，成立了农业机械领导小组，加强对支援农业的领导。（附图片）
