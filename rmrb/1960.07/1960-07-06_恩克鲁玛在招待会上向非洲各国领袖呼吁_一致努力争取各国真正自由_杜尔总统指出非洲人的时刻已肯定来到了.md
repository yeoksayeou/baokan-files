Xinhua News Agency, Accra, July 4th: Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah, speaking at a luncheon today, said that African leaders should selflessly, faithfully, and with a unified goal, strive to achieve genuine freedom for their territories and to break free from foreign rule.

The luncheon was held on the final day of the four-day celebration of the founding of the Republic of Ghana, to entertain delegations from various countries. Ke Hua, the Chinese Ambassador to Guinea, also attended the luncheon.

At the luncheon, Nkrumah also extended congratulations to the leaders and people of the newly independent Mali Federation, Congo, and Somalia.

Guinean President Sékou Touré also spoke at the luncheon. He said that no one could ignore the fact that, historically, the hour of Africans had certainly arrived; and no one could doubt the fact that the whole of Africa would soon be completely free from colonialism and imperialism.

Touré condemned the heinous racism and atrocities in South Africa, Angola, and so-called Portuguese Guinea. He said that as long as a single inch of African soil remained where true African sons and daughters had not obtained full independence and complete sovereignty, our independence and sovereignty would not have fully satisfied our needs.

Touré said that we certainly have not passed through the period where some people constantly attack our motives and conduct campaigns designed to divert our attention, heedless of the lessons, attempting to find weapons to divide us in the dying arsenal of colonialism. We certainly still need to deal with attempts at subversion and see the lure of traditional means of enticement.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, July 4th: Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah said today at the first formal meeting of the Republic's Parliament that "Ghana's foreign policy will continue to be one of positive neutrality and non-alignment." He said, "As I have explained many times before, this does not mean that the government of Ghana will merely be a silent bystander to world events."

Official delegations from various countries attending the founding ceremony of the Republic of Ghana attended the first formal meeting of the new parliament. Ke Hua, the Chinese Ambassador to Guinea, also attended the meeting.

In a speech outlining the policies of Ghana's ruling party, the Convention People's Party, Nkrumah said that the government of Ghana would continue to take active steps through the United Nations to promote and maintain peace and security among nations, and would make its utmost efforts to safeguard independence and world peace.

He said that the government of Ghana would continue to condemn the arms race and the production and testing of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world.

Speaking of Africa, Nkrumah said that the independence of Ghana in isolation is meaningless unless it is linked to the liberation of the whole of Africa and the embodiment of the African personality within the international community. He said that our determination on this issue is indestructible, and the government of Ghana will continue to provide all support to freedom fighters throughout Africa.

He praised the heroic men and women who sacrificed their lives for the independence of Algeria, as well as all those who fought against the degradation brought about by colonialism and racism.

He reiterated his broadcast speech of a few days ago: that the tide of African nationalism and freedom is so high that colonial powers cannot hope to go against the tide and remain in Africa.

He said that the government of Ghana opposes the inhumane apartheid policies of the South African government. He said that he recently stated in London that it is extremely embarrassing for Ghana to remain indefinitely within the Commonwealth with a government that recognizes and practices apartheid and racial discrimination.

Speaking of domestic policy, Nkrumah said that the government of Ghana will intensify its industrialization plan, which, coupled with the diversification and mechanization of agriculture, will provide the main basis for transforming Ghana's economic and social life.

    恩克鲁玛在招待会上向非洲各国领袖呼吁
    一致努力争取各国真正自由
    杜尔总统指出非洲人的时刻已肯定来到了
    新华社阿克拉4日电　加纳总统恩克鲁玛今天在午宴上讲话时说，非洲各国领袖应该无私、忠实和目标一致地努力使他们的领土获得真正的自由并摆脱外国的统治。
    这次午宴是恩克鲁玛在为期四天的庆祝加纳共和国成立活动的最后一天为招待各国政府代表团而举行的。中国驻几内亚大使柯华也出席了午宴。
    恩克鲁玛在午宴上还向最近独立的马里联邦、刚果、索马里亚的领袖和人民表示祝贺。
    几内亚总统塞古·杜尔也在午宴上发表了讲话。他说，没有一个人能够忽视这样的事实：从历史上来说，非洲人的时刻已经肯定地来到了；也没有一个人能怀疑这样的事实：整个非洲不久将完全摆脱殖民主义和帝国主义。
    杜尔谴责了南非、安哥拉和所谓葡属几内亚的罪恶的种族主义和暴行。他说，只要还有一寸非洲土地上的真正非洲儿女未获得充分的独立和完全的主权，我们的独立和主权就未能充分满足我们的需要。
    杜尔说，肯定我们还没有度过这样的时期：有人经常攻击我们的动机和进行旨在转移我们注意力的运动，不顾教训，企图在垂死的殖民主义的旧武器库中寻找分裂我们的武器。我们肯定仍需对付颠覆的企图和看到传统的利诱手段。
    据新华社阿克拉4日电　加纳共和国总统恩克鲁玛今天在共和国议会第一次正式会议上说，“加纳的外交政策将继续是积极中立和不结盟的政策”。他说，“正像我以前很多次解释的那样，这并不意味着加纳政府将仅仅是世界事件的沉默的旁观者。”
    出席新议会第一次正式会议的有参加加纳共和国成立典礼的各国官方代表团。中国驻几内亚大使柯华也出席了这次会议。
    恩克鲁玛在概述加纳执政党——人民大会党的政策的演说中说，加纳政府将继续通过联合国采取积极的步骤以促进和维护各国之间的和平与安全，并且将尽最大的努力来维护独立和世界和平。
    他说，加纳政府将继续谴责军备竞赛和在世界任何地方生产和试验核武器。
    恩克鲁玛在谈到非洲时说，孤立的加纳的独立是没有意义的，除非它同整个非洲的解放以及非洲人格在国际团体内的体现联系起来。他说，我们在这个问题上的决心是不可摧毁的，加纳政府将继续对非洲各地的自由战士提供一切支持。
    他赞扬为阿尔及利亚的独立而牺牲生命的英勇的男女以及所有那些对殖民主义和种族主义带来的退化进行斗争的人。
    他重述了他在几天以前发表的广播演说：非洲民族主义和自由的浪潮是这样高涨，因此殖民国家不能够希望逆流而上，而在非洲残存下来。
    他说，加纳政府反对南非政府不人道的种族隔离政策。他说，我最近在伦敦说过，对于加纳来说，无限期地同一个承认和实行种族隔离和种族歧视的政府留在英联邦内是十分难堪的。
    恩克鲁玛在谈到国内政策时说，加纳政府将加紧实行工业化计划，工业化加上农业的多种经营和机械化，将为改变加纳的经济和社会生活提供主要基础。
