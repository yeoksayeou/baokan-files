The development of chlorella from the large-scale pig farming business has aroused people's interest in algae.

The application of algae plants in our country can be traced back to the Zhou Dynasty at the latest. The poem "Shaonan Caiping" in the Book of Songs says: "Where to pick algae? In the puddles." The algae mentioned here are of two kinds, one is the shrimp algae belonging to the Potamogetonaceae family. Although it is not a true algae plant, it appears emerald green and lovely because it has true algae parasitizing on it. In ancient times, the beauty of algae was highly praised and "algae" was used as a metaphor for "literary talent," and the decorated ceiling was called "algae well." Also, the "Tianguan" chapter in the Book of Rites records: "The reality of Jiadou... Tái pickled vegetables...", the so-called "Tái" is also called "Shiyi," which is a green algae plant such as "dried Porphyra."

Ancient people believed that fish liked algae the most, so the poem "Xiaoya Yuzao" in the Book of Songs also says: "Fish are in the algae." In fact, if there are appropriate amount of algae plants in the pond, the fish really like it, which can increase the migration and improve the appetite; and shrimp algae is also a very delicious food for grass carp. However, at that time, the utilization of algae was mainly as a vegetable. The Zuo Zhuan says: "Pingfan Yunzao's vegetables," and Liu Zhen of the Wei Dynasty praised the function of algae, saying: "Pick it to offer to the ancestral temple, and you can shame the honored guests." From here, it is not difficult to imagine how precious it is.

Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty wrote in "Jiang Fu": "...Strange water objects, there are jade scallops, sea moons, geomorps, and lithophere...", according to Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica", the "lithophere" mentioned here is Gracilaria... It can be seen that the utilization of various important large algae plants has a very long history! In addition to being used as vegetables, these algae are also cleverly used in other aspects. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" says: "Deer horn vegetable... soaking for a long time will turn into a gelatinous substance, women use it to comb their hair, it is sticky and not messy." It also says: "Kelp... Nowadays, people in Dengzhou dry it to tie utensils." In the Jiangnan area, it was invented very early to use algae glue to paint walls and window paper, and also used to paint metal objects, the anti-rust performance is also very good. In particular, Spirogyra in green algae was also used to make paper. When Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote "博物志", Emperor Wu of Jin presented him with ten thousand "Celi paper", which was made of Spirogyra.

Single-celled algae individuals are very small and can only be seen with a microscope, but they can win by quantity. A large number of reproductions often cause well water, pond water, lake water, and even river water, sea water, rain, and snow to be colored. Red tides in bays such as Tokyo Bay in Japan are caused by the sudden reproduction of Ceratium algae.

Ancient people could not understand the discoloration phenomenon of water caused by single-celled algae, but according to their experience, they actually used single-celled algae. Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty mentioned in "齐民要术" the use of "old wall soil" as fertilizer. According to research, the fertilizer efficiency of old wall soil is caused by nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae and other algae parasitizing in it. Moreover, Fang Yizhi of the Ming Dynasty mentioned in "物理小识" that the foamy pond water is dried into powder and mixed into the soup; so the biggest possibility of drying the water into powder is due to the large number of algae reproduction in the water, and in fact, the foaming of pond water is also a sign of large-scale algae reproduction.

The artificial cultivation of algae has a long history. Wang Xiangjin's "群芳谱" of the Ming Dynasty records: "If you want moss to grow on the stone, mix the rice seedling mud and horse manure evenly, and apply it to the moist place, it will grow soon." Although it is said to be "moss" here, in fact most of it is algae, and the principle is the same as using manure to cultivate chlorella now.

Algae plants were previously mistakenly thought to be of little use, but now people's views on them are just the opposite. In particular, single-celled algae such as chlorella are even called "green meat." In fact, such a comparison still greatly wrongs them, because their nutritional value is actually greater than meat and eggs. Therefore, since the beginning of this century, algae has been increasingly valued. During World War I, Germany had already advocated the cultivation of chlorella to remedy the shortage of food. Countries such as India and Japan have also studied nitrogen-fixing blue algae. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule in our country, the research on algae can actually be said to be equal to zero, but after liberation, this blank spot was quickly filled. According to reports, several kinds of blue algae such as Anabaena and Nostoc discovered in our country have more nitrogen fixation ability than Japanese algae; and the yield per mu of Scenedesmus is as high as 12,000 jin, which is more than twice that of Japan; especially the cultivation of chlorella is blooming everywhere, and many places have done very well... In the field of algae research, we are also catching up with and surpassing the international advanced level.

    小球藻和它的家族们
    ——藻类史话
    杨旻
    从大办养猪事业中发展小球藻，引起了人们对藻类的兴趣。
    藻类植物的应用在我国至迟可以追溯到周代。《诗经》《召南采苹》篇云：“于以采藻，于彼行潦。”这里所说的藻有两种，一种是属于眼子菜科的虾藻，虽然它并不是真正的藻类植物，但由于有真正的藻寄生，颜色便显得翠绿可爱。古代盛称藻的美丽而以“藻”喻“文采”，把图饰的天花板称为“藻井”。又《周礼》《天官》篇载：“加豆之实……箈菹……”，所谓“箈”又叫“石衣”，是“干浒苔”之类的绿藻植物。
    古代人们认为鱼类最喜欢藻，所以《诗经》《小雅鱼藻》篇又说：“鱼在在藻”。实际上池塘如果有适量的藻类植物，鱼儿的确很喜欢，这就可以增加回游，提高食欲；并且虾藻对于草鱼来说，还是一种非常可口的食物。不过当时对于藻的利用，主要是作为一种菜食。《左传》上说：“苹蘩蕰藻之菜”，魏刘桢称赞藻的功用说：“采之荐宗庙，可以羞嘉客。”从这里，也就不难想见它是怎样的珍贵了。
    晋郭璞《江赋》云：“……水物怪错，则有玉珧、海月、土肉、石华……”，据李时珍的《本草纲目》所说，这里提到的“石华”就是石花菜……可见，各种重要大型藻类植物的利用，都已有非常悠久的历史了！这些藻类除作为菜食以外，还巧妙地被用在其他方面。《本草纲目》云：“鹿角菜……久浸则化如胶状，女人用以梳发，粘而不乱。”又说：“海带……今登州人干之以束器物。”江南一带，很早就发明用藻胶涂墙壁和窗纸，又用于涂金属器物，防锈的性能也很优良。特别是绿藻中的水绵，还被用来造纸，晋朝张华撰《博物志》时，晋武帝赠给他的万番“侧理纸”，便是用水绵所造。
    单细胞藻类个体非常微小，要用显微镜才能察见，它们却能以数量取胜，大量繁殖起来，往往会使井水、塘水、湖水甚至河水、海水以及雨、雪等染上颜色。日本东京湾等海湾出现的赤潮，便是由于虫藻的骤然繁殖而成。
    对于单细胞藻类所造成的水的变色现象，古代人们是不可能理解的，但是他们根据经验，实际上却也利用到了单细胞藻类。后魏贾思勰所著《齐民要术》上曾提到利用“旧墙土”作肥料，据研究，旧墙土的肥效，便是由于寄生在其中的有固氮能力的兰绿藻等所造成的。又明朝方以智所著的《物理小识》，更提到用发生泡沫的池塘水晒干为粉，调于汤中；所以能把水晒成粉，最大的可能就是由于水中繁殖了大量的藻类，而实际上池塘水发生泡沫，也正是藻类大量繁殖的标志。
    藻类的人工培养，已有相当悠久的历史。明朝王象晋的《群芳谱》上记载：“欲石上生苔，以茭泥马粪和匀，涂润湿处，不久即生。”这里虽说是“苔”，实际上大部分却是藻类，和现在用粪水培养小球藻，其原理正是一样的。
    藻类植物在以前曾被错误地认为没有多大用处，而现在人们对它的看法却恰恰相反。特别是小球藻等单细胞藻类，更被人们喻为“绿色之肉”，其实这样比拟，还是大大委屈它们了，因为它们的营养价值，实在比肉、蛋更大。所以从本世纪初开始，藻类便日益被重视起来。德国在第一次世界大战时，就已有人提倡培养小球藻，以补救粮食的不足。印度、日本等国还研究有固氮作用的兰藻。我国在国民党反动派统治时期，藻类的研究实际上可以说是等于零，但解放以后，这个空白点也很快就弥补起来了。据报道：我国所发现的鱼腥藻、念珠藻等几种兰藻，其固氮能力还超过了日本的藻类；而栅藻的亩产量，竟高达一万二千斤，比日本的要超过一倍之多；尤其是小球藻的培养，到处开花，许多地方都作得十分出色……。在藻类的研究这个领域，我们也正在赶上并超过国际的先进水平。
