    "Borrowing from Heaven and Earth" for Multiple Cropping Annually
    ——Experiences of the Nantong Special District, Jiangsu Province, in Implementing the Guiding Principle of Taking Grain as the Key Link and Promoting Overall Development
    Xinhua News Agency Investigation Team, Xin Hua Daily reporters
    The Nantong region in the Yangtze River Delta is a well-known economic crop area with a large population and limited land. The average amount of land per person in the district is 1.3 mu, of which economic crops such as cotton, jute, and mint account for 40%. How to implement the principle of taking grain as the key link and promoting overall development in such a region is a major concern for people.
    
    Fully Utilize Land and Time
    In July, we visited counties throughout the Nantong Special District and witnessed inspiring scenes of skillful farming everywhere. Green corn, densely planted with more than 3,000 plants per mu, had strong stalks and large ears, already displaying red silks. Cornfields were intercropped with soybeans, millet, sweet potatoes, chives, etc. Mint fields and pumpkin fields were also intercropped with corn. Large areas of cotton began to bud. Commune members proudly asked us: "Look, how is this 'wheat-intercropped-cotton' compared to single-crop cotton?" It turned out that the cotton fields here had recently harvested a crop of wheat. Before the wheat was fully mature, people had sown cotton seeds between the rows of wheat, so that when the wheat was harvested, the cotton appeared. The variety of "intercropping" and "mixed cropping" here can be said to be novel and numerous. If we roughly categorize them, there are at least five major types: grain intercropped with grain, grain intercropped with economic crops; economic crops intercropped with economic crops, grain intercropped with vegetables, and grain intercropped with green manure.
    
    What is even more valuable is that this intercropping and mixed cropping is not just once a year, but twice or three times. Taking grain intercropped with grain as an example, some fields had wheat or broad beans/wheat intercropped as the previous crop, and then early corn was sown between the wheat rows. After the wheat was harvested, soybeans or late sorghum were intercropped. Some fields had carrots or green manure as the previous crop, then spring corn was intercropped with millet, and finally late soybeans or buckwheat were intercropped. Three crops a year through intercropping and mixed cropping has become commonplace in the Nantong region. The area with four crops a year or nine crops in two years is also increasing. Miracles of five or six crops a year have also appeared.
    
    In the Nantong region, extensive planting along roadsides, making the most of every inch of land, is also very prominent. All roadsides, large and small ditch banks, in front of and behind houses, are planted with soybeans, peanuts, taro, cotton...
    
    In this way, the entire Nantong region fully utilizes land, space, and time to achieve the goal of increasing production through multiple cropping. In the words of the local people, they are "borrowing from heaven and earth, making one mu equal to several mu, and one year equal to thirteen and a half months."
    
    Some may ask: Can the crops grow well when planted so densely and in such a variety? In fact, this doubt had already been encountered locally when large-scale promotion of intercropping and multiple cropping first began. Some people said: Multiple plantings will not result in multiple harvests, and multiple cropping will "exhaust the soil" (referring to decreased soil fertility). This concern has been dispelled by the facts of recent years, especially by the thriving crops before our eyes. We traveled more than a thousand li in the Nantong region, and everywhere we went, various crops were growing well. In many places, corn, cotton, soybeans, and other crops were growing no worse than single-cropped versions we had seen in other regions.
    
    Fertilizer First, Skillful Crop Rotation
    Rational Rotation, No Idle Seasons
    
    Is it possible to have several crops a year because the natural conditions in the Nantong region are particularly superior? Compared to some regions in northern China, the time suitable for crop growth is a bit longer here, but in terms of overall natural conditions, it is not the best. The soil here includes clay, light sandy soil, heavy sandy soil, sandy loam, and coastal saline-alkali soil; the annual frost-free period is 220 to 250 days; the highest temperature reaches 40 degrees Celsius, the lowest is minus 5 degrees Celsius, and the average is around 15 degrees Celsius; facing the Yellow Sea, it is often threatened by typhoons. Under such natural conditions, on such land, being able to achieve multiple cropping and increased harvests, and the land becoming more fertile with each planting, is due in large part to the superiority of the people's commune collective farming system and the implementation of effective measures to both "take" from and "give" to the land, properly resolving the contradiction between utilizing and cultivating soil fertility.
    
    To ask for grain from the land, also give "grain" to the land. In the "giving," fertilizer takes the lead. The Nantong Prefectural Committee of the CPC, based on the increased demand for fertilizer and improved soil fertility due to the increased multiple cropping index, first proposed the fighting slogan of "grasping green manure like grasping grain, and running pig farms like running factories," and at the same time summarized the advanced experiences of the masses and created the "nine-character" method for accumulating and using fertilizer. The implementation of the "nine-character" method for accumulating and using fertilizer greatly expanded the sources of fertilizer, and almost all weeds and miscellaneous materials became valuable fertilizers, ensuring that the land's need for fertilizer was met after increasing the multiple cropping index.
    
    On the basis of fertilizer taking the lead, and also adapting to local conditions, seizing the agricultural season, skillfully arranging crop rotations, rational crop rotation, and no idle seasons were implemented. Intercropping and multiple cropping mean that several crops grow simultaneously in the same field. If one step goes wrong, it will affect the entire situation. Therefore, when planning intercropping and multiple cropping, the people's communes all started from the annual and even two- or three-year production increase goals, looking ahead and behind, drawing inferences from one instance, and considering the overall situation and rational layout. In the matching of intercropped and mixed crops, they adopted methods such as combining tall-stalked crops with low-stalked crops, combining leguminous crops with gramineous crops, and combining crops with long growing periods with crops with short growing periods. A rational layout, coupled with timely sowing and careful management, not only ensured that the various intercropped and multiple crops generally grew well and yielded abundant harvests, but also cultivated soil fertility. The "wheat-cotton-soybean, green manure-corn, soybean-wheat" cycle rotation method created by the Seventh Brigade of the Yinyang People's Commune in Qidong County ensures that grain, cotton, oil, and fertilizer are all harvested abundantly, and also ensures that soil fertility does not become barren due to multiple cropping. In 1959, this brigade doubled the wheat planting area on the original cultivated land area, and the yield per unit area increased by 60% compared to 1957; the cotton yield was still no lower than the bumper harvest of 1958, even after suffering continuous drought and typhoon disasters; the corn planting area was expanded by 65%, and the yield per unit area increased by 31%; the yields of broad beans and green manure also increased greatly. This year, the planting area of wheat, broad beans, and green manure that have already been harvested has doubled again compared to last year, the wheat yield per unit area has increased by another 14%, and the yields of broad beans and green manure have both doubled.
    
    Concentrate Labor on Attacking Agriculture
    Renovate Tools According to Local Conditions
    
    In the Nantong region, because economic crops account for a large proportion, cultivation work originally required a relatively large amount of labor. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the great development of industry, culture, education, and welfare, a portion of the labor force has also been occupied. Under such circumstances, with the growth of the multiple cropping index, labor has become increasingly strained. In response to this situation, the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the CPC timely and clearly proposed to concentrate superior forces to focus on field management, and resolutely implemented the instructions of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC on the issue of labor. Therefore, during the most intense summer farming season, when planting, harvesting, and management were progressing simultaneously, it was generally achieved that field management of grain and cotton fields were not neglected.
    
    At the same time, the widespread promotion of effective new tools allows agricultural work with a strong sense of timing to be completed ahead of schedule, ensuring that multiple cropping does not miss the agricultural season and that the front and rear are closely linked, allowing crops sufficient time to grow. This year, the entire special district promoted 30,000 "Guangxi 59-3 type" rice transplanters. After appropriate modifications to adapt to local conditions, most of them played a role. Rudong County alone used rice transplanters to transplant 150,000 mu, saving more than 200,000 man-days compared to manual transplanting. As a result, many communes finished transplanting late rice earlier this year than they did mid-season rice last year. Some counties and communes have also created new tools adapted to the technical requirements of intercropping, mixed cropping, and planting economic crops. For example, cotton drills for strip planting wheat, corn dibblers, jute seeders, etc. The Nantong Prefectural Committee of the CPC and the county committees and commune party committees are actively considering and studying the creation of a set of new tools adapted to the requirements of intercropping and multiple cropping from sowing to field management, harvesting, processing, and storage, fundamentally resolving the contradiction between increasing the multiple cropping index and the shortage of labor.
    
    Overall Arrangement, Double Leap Forward in Grain and Cotton
    
    In the Nantong region, which has a large population and limited land, some farmers have historically attempted to gain a little more harvest on limited land, so intercropping and mixed cropping practices have sporadically appeared. However, before liberation, the weak strength of the individual small-scale peasant economy, coupled with the brutal exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class, prevented this creation from being applied on a large area of land. After liberation, with the realization of land reform and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the peasants truly became the masters of the land, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Intercropping and mixed cropping became an important measure to seize high yields and gradually expanded. Especially after the Great Leap Forward and the realization of people's communes, the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the CPC, based on the Party Central Committee's policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting overall development, and in light of the specific conditions of the region, formulated a policy of taking grain as the key link, emphasizing both grain and cotton, unified planning, and overall leap forward in agricultural production. In order to realize this policy, party committees at all levels, after deeply mobilizing the masses and summarizing the various advanced experiences of the masses, regarded intercropping, mixed cropping, and multiple cropping as revolutionary measures to reform the cultivation system, fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes of being "large in size and collective in nature," and vigorously promoted them. On the one hand, the masses were universally mobilized, everyone contributed ideas, skillfully managed multiple cropping, and each showed their abilities like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea. At the same time, leading cadres from the prefecture, county, commune, and even brigade party branches gathered the best experiences from the masses, improved and promoted them through extensive planting of experimental fields, command fields, and cutting-edge fields. This year, the methods of intercropping, mixed cropping, and multiple cropping have been comprehensively promoted in the entire district, and there have been many new developments. This year, the multiple cropping index in the entire district reached 230%.
    
    With the rapid expansion of the area of intercropping, mixed cropping, and multiple cropping, the agricultural production landscape in the Nantong region, especially grain production, has undergone obvious changes. This economic crop area, which has always been unable to produce enough grain and needed the state to import grain for supply, has seen the amount of grain imported decrease year by year. In 1957, 630 million jin were imported, in 1958 it decreased to 460 million jin, and in 1959 it decreased by another 224 million jin. At the same time, the yields of cotton, oilseeds, and other economic crops are increasing. In 1957, the cotton yield was 1.5 million dan, and in 1959 it increased to 1.852 million dan; during this period, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also greatly developed. This year, with the expansion of the area of intercropping and mixed cropping and the increase in the multiple cropping index, the commune members of the entire district are full of confidence in the glorious task proposed by the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the CPC of striving to be self-sufficient in grain and have a slight surplus while ensuring the completion of the task of producing a large amount of industrial raw materials for the state.

    “借天借地”一年多熟
    ——江苏南通专区执行以粮为纲全面发展方针的经验
    新华社调查组、新华日报记者
    长江三角洲的南通地区，是个人多地少的著名的经济作物区。全区平均每人一亩三分田，其中棉花、黄麻、薄荷等经济作物占40％。在这样的地区，如何贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展的方针，是人们很关心的一件大事。
    充分利用土地和时间
    7月，我们遍访南通专区各县，到处看到巧种田的动人景象。密植程度达每亩三千株以上的青玉米，秆壮棒大，已吐红缨。玉米田里都套种着黄豆、糜子、红薯、韭菜等等。有的薄荷田、南瓜田也间作了玉米。大片的棉花开始罩垅现蕾。公社社员自豪地问我们：“你们看，这‘麦套棉’比一熟棉如何？”原来，这里的棉田在不久以前，都收过一茬麦子，在麦子还没有成熟以前，人们就在麦子的行间播下了棉籽，收了麦子就显出了棉花。这里的“套种”、“间作”的花样可以说是新奇众多，如果大致划一下类，至少有这样五大类：粮套粮，粮套经济作物；经济作物套经济作物，粮套蔬菜，粮和绿肥间作。
    更可贵的是，这种套种间作，一年不只一次，而是二次、三次。仅以粮中套粮来说，有的前作是麦子或蚕豆、麦子间作，然后在麦行中播早玉米，麦收后再间种黄豆或晚高粱；有的前作是胡萝卜或绿肥，然后套种春玉米间作糜子，最后套种晚黄豆或荞麦。套种、间作，一年三熟，在南通地区已经是很平常的事情了；一年四熟，两年九熟的面积也越来越大；一年五熟、六熟的奇迹也出现了。
    在南通地区，广种十边，寸土必争，也很突出。这里的所有大小路旁，大小沟边，房前舍后，都生长着黄豆、花生、芋头、棉花……。
    这样，在整个南通地区，就充分地利用了土地、空间和时间，达到多种多收的增产目的。用当地群众的话来说，他们是“借天借地，一亩顶几亩，一年等于十三个半月。”
    可能有人会问：种得那样杂、那样多，庄稼能长得好吗？其实，这种疑问在刚开始大量推广套种复种的时候，在当地就已碰到过。有人说：迭种不能迭收，多种会“痨田”（指地力减退）。这种顾虑，已经被几年来的事实，特别是眼前茁壮的庄稼消除了。我们在南通地区周游了一千多里，所到之处，各种作物都生长得很好，许多地方的玉米、棉花、黄豆等作物，比我们在其他地区看到单作的同种作物长得并不坏。
    肥料挂帅　巧排茬口
    合理轮作　四季不闲
    一年几熟，是不是因为南通地区自然条件特别优越呢？比之我国北方某些地区，这里适宜农作物生长的时间是长一点，但就全部自然条件来看，并不是最好。这里的土地，有粘土、轻沙土、重沙土、沙黄土和沿海的盐碱土；全年无霜期二百二十天到二百五十天；气温最高达四十度，最低零下五度，平均在十五度左右；面临黄海，常受台风威胁。在这样的自然条件下，在这样的土地上，能够作到多种多收，并且土地越种越肥，重要原因之一，是发挥了人民公社集体耕作制度的优越性，对土地实行了又“取”又“给”的有效措施，妥善地解决了利用地力和培养地力的矛盾。
    向土地要粮食，也给土地以“粮食”。在“给”当中，由肥料挂帅。中共南通地委根据复种指数提高，需要大量增加肥料、增进地力的要求，最先提出了“像抓粮食一样的抓绿肥，像办工厂一样的办猪场”的战斗口号，同时总结了群众中的先进经验，创造了积肥用肥的“九字”法。积肥用肥“九字”法的贯彻执行，大大地扩大了肥源，几乎一切杂物野草，都成了宝贵的肥料，保证了增加复种指数后土地对肥料的需求。
    在肥料挂帅的基础上，又因地制宜，抓准农时，巧排茬口，合理轮作，四季不闲。套作复种，几种作物在同一块田里同时生长，如果一着失错，就会影响全局。所以各人民公社在规划套作复种时，都从全年以至二年、三年的增产目标出发，瞻前顾后，举一反三，通盘考虑，合理布局。在套种间作作物的配合上，他们采取了高秆作物和低秆作物结合，豆科作物和禾本科作物结合，生育期长的和生育期短的作物结合等办法。布局合理，再加上播种及时，管得精细，不仅保证了套种、复种的各种作物普遍生长良好，样样丰收，而且培养了地力。启东县寅阳人民公社第七大队创造的“麦—棉—黄豆、绿肥—玉米、黄豆—麦”循环轮作法，就是既保证了粮、棉、油、肥样样丰收，又保证了地力不因多种而瘠薄。1959年，这个队在原有耕地面积上，将麦子种植面积扩大了一倍，单产比1957年增加60％；棉花在连续遭受干旱和台风灾害的情况下，产量仍不低于大丰收的1958年；玉米种植面积扩大了65％，单产增加了31％；蚕豆和绿肥产量也都大大增加。今年，已经收获到手的麦子、蚕豆和绿肥的种植面积，又比去年扩大了一倍，麦子单产又增加了14％，蚕豆和绿肥产量都翻了一番。
    集中劳力主攻农业
    因地制宜革新工具
    南通地区由于经济作物比重大，培植工作本来就需要较多的劳动力。大跃进以来，由于工业、文教和福利等事业的大发展，又占用了一部分劳动力。在这种情况下，随着复种指数的增长，劳动力越来越感到紧张。针对这种形势，中共南通地委及时而明确地提出了要集中优势兵力，主攻田间管理，并且坚决地贯彻执行了中共江苏省委关于劳动力问题的指示。因此，在种、收、管齐头并进最紧张的夏季农忙期间，普遍作到了粮、棉田间管理两不误。
    同时，大量推广用之有效的新工具，使时间性较强的农活抢到季节前头，保证复种不误农时，前后紧密衔接，让农作物有足够的时间成长。今年，全专区共推广了三万部“广西五九—三型”插秧机，经过因地制宜的适当修改，大部分发挥了作用。单是如东一个县就用插秧机插秧十五万亩，比手工插秧节约了二十多万个人工。因而许多公社今年晚稻插秧结束的时间，比去年中稻还早。有些县、社还创造了适应套种、间作和种植经济作物技术要求的新工具。例如棉花钻麦条播机、玉米打塘机、黄麻播种机等。中共南通地委和各县县委、公社党委，正积极考虑和研究创造一套适应套作复种要求的从播种到田间管理、收割、加工保管的新工具，从根本上解决复种指数提高和劳动力不足的矛盾。
    全面安排　粮棉双跃进
    人多地少的南通地区，在历史上就有些农民试图在有限的土地上多争取一点收成，因此零零星星地出现过套种、间作的作法。但在解放以前，个体的小农经济的微弱力量，加上反动统治阶级的惨重剥削和压榨，这种创造无法在大面积的土地上得到应用。解放后，随着土地改革的实现和互助合作运动的发展，农民真正成了土地的主人，生产积极性大大提高，套种、间作才成为夺取高产的一项重要措施，逐渐扩大开来。特别是大跃进和实现了人民公社化以后，中共南通地委根据党中央以粮为纲、全面发展的方针，针对本地区的具体条件，拟定了以粮为纲，粮棉并举，统一安排，全面跃进的发展农业生产的方针。为实现这个方针，各级党委经过深入发动群众，总结群众中的各种先进经验，将套种、间作、复种作为改革耕作制度的革命性措施，充分发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，大力推广。一方面普遍动员群众，人人献计，巧管复种，八仙过海，各显其能。同时，从地、县、公社直到大队党支部，各级领导干部，将群众中最好的经验集中起来，通过广种试验田、指挥田、尖端田，加以提高推广。今年，套种、间作、复种的方法，在全区得到了全面推广，并且又有许多新的发展，全区今年复种指数达到230％。
    随着套种、间作、复种面积的迅速扩展，南通地区的农业生产面貌，特别是粮食生产发生了明显的变化。这个一向粮食不能自给，需要国家从外地调进粮食供应的经济作物地区，近几年来，调进粮食的数字逐年下降，1957年调进六亿三千万斤，1958年减少到四亿六千万斤，1959年又减少二亿二千四百万斤。同时，棉花、油料及其他经济作物的产量，正在上升，1957年棉花产量是一百五十万担，1959年就增到一百八十五万二千担；在这期间，林、牧、副、渔业也有了很大发展。今年，随着套种、间作面积的扩大，复种指数的提高，全区人民公社社员，对于中共南通地委提出的在保证完成为国家生产大量工业原料任务的同时，争取粮食自给并略有节余的光荣任务，充满信心。
