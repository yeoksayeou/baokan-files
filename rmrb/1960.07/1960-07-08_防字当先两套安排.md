	Thinking of the worst-case scenario, starting with the best possible approach, and widening the scope of preparations to allow for flexibility, will lead to initiative at every step. This is especially true in leading agricultural production. Because, under current scientific and technological conditions, we still cannot control nature to a greater extent. Agricultural production is constantly threatened by wind, frost, drought, and flood. The disaster resistance experience of Luoshuihe Commune in Lingqiu County precisely illustrates this point.
	Engaging in agricultural production means dealing with "Mother Nature," which means that the influence of nature is still significant. Therefore, fighting against natural disasters is a crucial aspect of agricultural production. Luoshuihe Commune is a place with particularly frequent and severe disasters, having suffered as many as forty-two disasters during the First Five-Year Plan. However, it is precisely this disaster-prone Luoshuihe Commune that has created the miracle of not reducing production despite disasters and achieving bumper harvests year after year. It has also found a "sixteen-character" guideline for fighting natural disasters, which deserves great celebration. So far, Luoshuihe Commune has not had heavy snow or thorough rain for eight and a half months. In the past, a "thousand-mile red land" would have been unavoidable. However, in today's People's Commune, because they have acted in accordance with the "sixteen-character" guideline, they have not only ensured the timely sowing of all arable land but also maintained 90% of the land without missing seedlings or broken ridges.
	What is the "sixteen-character" guideline of Luoshuihe Commune for fighting natural disasters? "Understand the patterns, research countermeasures, prevention first, two-pronged approach." Among these sixteen characters, which are the core? We believe it is "prevention first." Regarding the fight against natural disasters, there is a common term: "preventing and controlling disasters." The so-called "preventing and controlling disasters" actually includes two aspects: "prevention" and "control." In these two aspects, should "prevention" come first, or "control"? We believe "prevention" should come first. Why should "prevention" come first? Because "the best knife and arrow medicine is no match for not being cut," any disaster, once it occurs, will inevitably cause some losses, more or less. Therefore, we hope it is best not to happen, or happen less, or happen on a small scale, and not happen frequently or on a large scale. How to achieve this hope? The only way is to "prevention first," which is called "preventing problems before they occur." The reason we advocate large-scale water conservancy projects, afforestation, and transforming the natural landscape is to prevent or reduce the occurrence of natural disasters in the future. Of course, this cannot be fully achieved at present. So, what if a disaster does occur? Then, "control" is indispensable. But in order to "control" it in a timely and effective manner, it is also necessary to prepare in advance. "There is no guarantee of victory in a hasty battle" ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War"). Therefore, Chairman Mao has always taught us, "If you are prepared in advance you will succeed, if not you will fail," "Never fight unprepared battles," "Never fight battles you are not sure of winning." This applies to warfare, and it also applies to fighting natural disasters.
	The idea of "prevention first" is of extremely great significance in overcoming disasters. But how can the idea of "prevention first" be translated into practical action? The "two-pronged approach" is a good method, and it is the guarantee for realizing "prevention first." Without a "two-pronged approach," there is no such thing as "prevention first." What is the "two-pronged approach"? It means: one set of arrangements for current production, and another set of arrangements for disaster prevention and resistance. When formulating plans and arranging work (especially during seasons with frequent disasters), all possible disasters must be taken into account, and the most thorough preparations must be made, thinking of the worst-case scenario. After being included in the plan, someone must be responsible, someone must do it, and there must be time to do it, so that it is not squeezed out due to busy current production. At the same time, plans and arrangements should not be too rigid, and there should be room for flexibility to cope with various changes that may occur suddenly at any time. If this is truly done, the "unexpected" can be turned into "preparedness," allowing people to take the initiative and stand in an invincible position in the fight against natural disasters, and avoid being caught off guard and fighting in a hurry due to lack of preparation. If a disaster does not occur, so be it; if it does, it will be possible to immediately implement a nationwide mobilization and a major assault in an organized and planned manner, to "use earth to stop water and generals to block soldiers." Work arrangements reflect objective reality. Since there are two possibilities in objective situations (one is the possibility of no disaster, and the other is the possibility of disaster), we must act according to the "two-pronged approach." We must never rely solely on subjective wishes and groundlessly base our work arrangements only on the possibility of favorable weather, and only act according to one set of arrangements.
	The idea of "prevention first" and the method of the "two-pronged approach" have been described above. But how to conduct a "two-pronged approach" based on the idea of "prevention first"? For example, in what place, at what time, on which crops, should we guard against which disasters? How to prevent them? What to do? To what extent? This requires "understanding the patterns" and "researching countermeasures." As Chairman Mao taught us, "...no matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of that thing, its nature, its relationship with things outside it, you won't know the laws of that thing, you won't know how to do it, and you won't be able to do that thing well" ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War"). Therefore, if, in the Luoshuihe Commune's "sixteen-character" guideline for overcoming disasters, "prevention first" is the core, and "two-pronged approach" is the guarantee, then "understanding the patterns" and "researching countermeasures" are its foundation or premise. Otherwise, "prevention first" and "two-pronged approach" will become blind. In the laws of occurrence and development of various disasters, there are general laws and special laws. The six aspects of laws and countermeasures that Luoshuihe Commune has discovered all require "prevention first," and all countermeasures require a "two-pronged approach." Therefore, they believe that "prevention first" is the "law among laws," and "two-pronged approach" is the "countermeasure among countermeasures."

    防字当先两套安排
    事事都要从坏处着想，从好处着手，把盘子打的宽些，留有余地，就会一步主动，步步主动。领导农业生产更是如此。因为，在目前科学技术条件下，我们还不能在更大程度上控制自然，农业生产时刻在受着风、霜、旱、涝灾害的威胁。灵丘县落水河公社的抗灾经验，正好说明了这个道理。
    搞农业生产是和“老天爷”打交道的，就是说自然的影响还很大，所以和自然灾害进行斗争是农业生产中很重要的一件事情。落水河公社是个灾害特多特大的地方，第一个五年计划期间，各种灾害即遭过四十二次之多。可是，恰恰是这个灾害特多特大的落水河公社，创造了遭灾不减产，连年大丰收的奇迹，并且找到了一条向自然灾害作战的“十六字诀”的方针，这是值得大贺特贺的。到目前为止，落水河公社已经整整八个半月没有下过大雪、落过透雨了。若在过去，“赤地千里”在所难免的了。可是，在有了人民公社的今天，由于他们按照“十六字诀”的方针办了事，不但保证了全部耕地的按时下种，而且90％的地里不缺苗断垅。
    落水河公社向自然灾害作战的“十六字诀”是什么呢？“摸清规律、研究对策、防字当先、两套安排”。在这十六个字中，哪几个字是核心呢？我们认为是“防字当先”。对于向自然灾害作战，有一个普通的叫法，是“防治灾害”。所谓“防治灾害”实际上包括着两个方面，一个是“防”，一个是“治”。在这两个方面中，是“防”字应该当先呢？还是“治”字应该当先？我们认为“防”字应该当先。为什么“防”字应该当先？因为“再好的刀箭药也不如不割破”，任何灾害一旦发生之后，总不免或多或少造成一些损失，所以我们希望它最好不要发生，或者少发生、小发生，不要多发生、大发生。怎样达到这个希望呢？唯一的办法就是“防字当先”，这叫作“防患于未然”。我们所以要提倡大兴水利、植树造林，改造自然面貌，目的之一就是为了在今后不发生或少发生自然灾害。当然，这一点在目前还暂时不能完全作到。那么，万一灾害发生了，又怎么办呢？那就非“治”不可了。但是为了“治”得及时、有效，也必须事先有所防备。“临时仓卒应战，胜利的把握是没有的。”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）。所以毛主席从来就教导我们，“凡事预则立，不预则废”，“不打无准备的仗”，“不打无把握的仗”。打仗是如此，向自然灾害作战同样必须如此。
    “防字当先”的思想对战胜灾害有极其重大的意义。但是怎样才能把“防字当先”的思想见之于实际行动呢？“两套安排”就是很好的作法，它是实现“防字当先”的保证，没有“两套安排”也就无所谓“防字当先”。什么是“两套安排”呢？就是：一套安排当前生产，一套安排防灾抗灾。在制订计划、安排工作的时候（特别在灾害频繁的季节中），要把一切可能遇到的灾害都计算进去，要从最坏的地方着想，进行最充分的准备。列入计划之后，还要有人负责，有人去作，有时间作，不因当前生产繁忙而被挤掉。同时，计划、安排也不能打得过死，要留有余地，以便能够应付随时都可能突然发生的各种变化。果真这样作了，就可以把“猛不防”变为“有所防”，使人同自然灾害的战斗中，掌握主动权，立于不败之地，不致于因缺乏准备而手忙脚乱，仓卒应战。灾害不发生便罢，一发生，就能立即有组织、有计划地实行全民大动员、大突击，来它个“水来土掩，兵来将挡”。工作安排是反映客观的，客观情况既然有两个可能（一个是无灾的可能，一个是有灾的可能），我们就必须按“两套安排”办事。决不可单凭主观愿望，毫无根据地把自己的工作安排只是建筑在风调雨顺的可能上，只是按一套安排办事。
    “防字当先”的思想和“两套安排”的作法已如上述。可是，如何根据“防字当先”的思想进行“两套安排”呢？比如说，什么地方，什么时候，在哪几种作物上，应防备哪些灾害？怎样防备？作些什么？作到什么程度？这就必须“摸清规律”、“研究对策”了。正如毛主席教导我们的，“……不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）。所以，如果说，在落水河公社战胜灾害的“十六字诀”中，“防字当先”是核心，“两套安排”是保证，那么，“摸清规律”和“研究对策”又是它的基础或前提。否则“防字当先”和“两套安排”，就成了盲目的了。在各种灾害发生、发展的规律中，有一般的规律，有特殊的规律。落水河公社摸出的六个方面的规律和采取的六个方面的对策，条条规律都要求“防字当先”，条条对策都要求“两套安排”。所以，他们认为“防字当先”是“规律中的规律”，而“两套安排”则是“对策中的对策”。
