Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, Rome dispatch: In many cities across Italy yesterday, working people held large-scale strikes to protest the fascist atrocities of the government's bloody suppression of the people's struggle.

The people of Palermo and Catania, major cities in Sicily, held anti-fascist demonstrations yesterday. Government police continued their bloody suppression. In Palermo, an anti-fascist demonstration with 20,000 participants was held. Police used tear gas and opened fire on the demonstrators, killing two and injuring more than fifty. In addition, nearly three hundred people were arrested. In Catania, a large-scale anti-fascist demonstration was also held on the 8th. One demonstrator was shot and killed by the police, who also used tear gas on the demonstrating masses.

Under the police's frantic suppression, the demonstrators had no choice but to rise up in self-defense. They resisted and counterattacked the police's offensive with paving stones, iron bars, chains, and planks torn from scaffolding, and erected street barricades.

The demonstrators also adopted the tactic of dispersing the ranks and quickly regrouping to fight the police, who deployed helicopters to track the demonstrators.

In Reggio Emilia, several thousand people yesterday paid tribute to the five people who were killed by police in the demonstration on the 7th.

In Florence, the demonstrating masses were attacked by police with tear gas and machine guns.

The capital, Rome, remains shrouded in tension, with armed police patrolling and setting up checkpoints everywhere.

In many cities across Italy, working people yesterday responded to the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor to hold a general strike, protesting the Italian government's bloody suppression of the anti-fascist demonstrators.

In Reggio Emilia, a city-wide general strike was held, paralyzing city activities.

In the important industrial city of Milan, factory workers and public transportation workers held a strike. The city of Modena was also paralyzed by the strike.

In Genoa, the northwestern port city where the working people first launched the anti-fascist struggle, the strike brought public transportation to a complete standstill, and most shops closed.

In the famous water city of Venice, the steamship workers responsible for city transportation held a strike, and shops and institutions were closed.

In the Free Territory of Trieste, 2,500 people also gathered on the 8th to protest the Italian authorities' bloody suppression of the demonstrating masses in Reggio Emilia on the 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 8th: The World Federation of Trade Unions cabled the Italian General Confederation of Labor on the 8th, praising the Italian working people for their powerful struggle to defend democracy and satisfy their economic and social demands.
