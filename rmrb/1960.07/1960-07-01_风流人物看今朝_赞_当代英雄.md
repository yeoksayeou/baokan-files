Admiring Today's Leading Figures
—In Praise of "Contemporary Heroes"
Make

In art, realistically and vividly depicting the images of leaders and outstanding contemporary figures, and praising our great era, is the desire of millions of people and an ideal that many artists are constantly pursuing in their creative practice. Recently, the large-scale sketch "Contemporary Heroes," collectively created by fourteen young teachers from the Central Academy of Fine Arts High School, is a new and beautiful picture. With abundant political enthusiasm, the young painters have successfully shaped a brilliant group portrait of heroes in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Since ancient times, many artists have depicted leaders and heroes, but due to the development of society and the limitations of the times, they could not correctly assess the role of individuals in history, and therefore could not truly reveal the essence of heroes, as well as the relationship between heroes and the masses. Therefore, what appeared in the works were often individual heroes who were detached from the people or even stood above the people, or those beautified emperors and officials whose appearances were awe-inspiring but whose spirits were empty. "Contemporary Heroes," however, depicts the spiritual outlook of new heroes in a new era. They have lofty ideals and excellent qualities, they deeply believe in the power of the masses, and they unite closely with the people, leading or motivating the masses to strive together for a better tomorrow. This is the new era characteristic of contemporary heroes, and also a prominent achievement of this painting.

The specific scene in the painting is: early in the morning, advanced representatives from all aspects gathered in the capital of the motherland, bathed in the brilliant morning glow, and followed Chairman Mao into the Great Hall of the People to participate in the gathering of heroes. Behind the heroes are the open square, Tiananmen, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Museum of Chinese History, and the Monument to the People's Heroes in the capital, as well as the distant view of the urban area. The deliberate depiction of these buildings and scenery not only strengthens the realism of the picture and the decorative effect in the composition, but more importantly, deepens the content of the painting and evokes contemplation. The image of Chairman Mao in the painting is solemn and full of optimism. The painters have truthfully expressed the admirable and approachable demeanor of the great leader, and the deep feelings of loving the masses and closely connecting with the masses. The heroes united around Chairman Mao are unified in the forward-marching ranks, but there are also certain changes. The characterization of their images is mostly based on real heroes as models, and artistic generalization and creation have been carried out. For example, for several figures close to Chairman Mao, the audience can easily see that there are worker heroes of the Meng Tai type, people's commune chairmen of the Wang Guofan type, and revolutionary old mothers of the Rong Guanshou type, which look vivid and natural. Some of them are old heroes who participated in the democratic revolution, and some are new soldiers who grew up in the socialist revolution. Whether they come from factories, rural areas, or the front lines of national defense, or whether they come from fraternal ethnic regions or any work post, their faces, ages, and work are different, but each is full of energy, full of lofty ideals for building communism, and the heroic and optimistic mood of the Great Leap Forward era.

Another prominent achievement of "Contemporary Heroes" is that it has absorbed the strengths of traditional Chinese painting and developed and created them. The whole painting has a magnificent composition, a majestic momentum, distinct characters, and magnificent scenery, filled with a heartening and joyful atmosphere, embodying the great mind and spirit of the Chinese people. When we appreciate this painting, facing these spirited heroes marching forward with their heads held high, it is like seeing the morning sun rising slowly in the east, with thousands of rays of light, reflecting the six hundred million people of the motherland uniting closely under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and marching with firm steps towards the infinitely brilliant future of socialism and communism!

It is no exaggeration to say that this painting is a dazzling heroic epic. Its appearance powerfully proves the victory of the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The authors conducted extensive interviews and research for the creation of this painting, and designed hundreds of sketches and studies. During the creation process, they also put forward the requirement of "painting heroes with the spirit of heroes, and writing about the era with the feelings of the era," and it took two months to complete. At present, what we see is only a sketch, and the creation of some characters and the depiction of details need to be further deepened. It is believed that it will be processed and improved in the future when painting oil paintings, so as to make this painting more perfect. Let hundreds of millions of people sing praises for our contemporary heroes in unison!

### 风流人物看今朝——赞“当代英雄”

    风流人物看今朝
    ——赞“当代英雄”
    马克
    在美术作品中，真实而生动地表现领袖和当代优秀人物的形象，歌颂我们伟大的时代，是千百万人民的愿望，也是许多美术家在创作实践中不断探求的理想。最近，中央美术学院附中十四位青年教师集体创作的巨幅素描《当代英雄》，就是一幅又新又美的图画。年青的画家以充沛的政治热情，成功地塑造出了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中光辉的英雄群像。
    自古以来，不少美术家描绘过领袖和英雄，但是由于社会的发展和时代的限制，他们不可能正确地估价个人在历史上的作用，因而也就不能真正揭示出英雄的本质，以及英雄和人民群众的关系。所以出现在作品中的往往是那些脱离人民甚至站在人民之上的个人英雄豪杰，或者是那些外貌赫然而精神空虚的被美化了的帝王、官吏。而《当代英雄》所描绘的却完全是新时代新英雄的精神面貌。他们具有崇高的理想和优秀的品质，他们深信人民群众的力量，和人民紧密团结在一起，领导或带动着群众共同为更美好的明天而奋斗。这是当代英雄所具有的崭新的时代特征，也是这幅画的一个突出的成就。
    画中具体的情节是：清晨，聚集在祖国首都的各个方面的先进代表们，披着灿烂的朝霞，跟随在毛主席的周围步入人民大会堂去参加群英会。在英雄们的身后是开阔的广场、天安门、中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆和首都人民英雄纪念碑，以及城区的远貌。这些建筑和景物的着意刻划，不仅是加强了画面的真实感和构图上的装饰效果，而更重要的是加深了这幅画的内容，发人联想深思。画中毛主席的形象是庄严和充满乐观主义的。画家们真实地表现出了伟大的领袖的可敬可亲的风度，和热爱群众密切联系群众的深厚感情。团结在主席周围的英雄们，既统一在阔步向前的行列里，但又有一定的变化。其形象的刻划大都是以真正的英雄为模特儿而又进行了艺术的概括和创造。例如紧挨在主席身边的几个人物，观众很容易可以看出有孟泰式的工人英雄，有王国藩型的人民公社社长，也有戎冠秀式的革命老妈妈，看去生动自然，栩栩如生。他们中有的是参加过民主革命的老英雄，也有在社会主义革命中成长的新战士，他们不论是来自工厂、农村或是国防前线，也不论是来自兄弟民族地区或是任何工作岗位，其面貌、年龄和工作虽然各不相同，但个个干劲十足，都满怀着建设共产主义的崇高理想，和大跃进时代豪迈乐观的情绪。
    《当代英雄》的另一突出成就，是吸取了民族传统绘画的长处，并加以发挥创造。整幅画构图宏伟，气势磅礴，人物鲜明，景色壮丽，洋溢着振奋人心的喜悦气氛，体现了我国人民伟大的胸襟和气魄。当我们欣赏这幅画的时候，面对着这些神采奕奕昂首阔步前进的英雄们，犹如看到早晨的太阳冉冉东升，霞光万道，反映出了祖国六亿人民紧紧团结在党和毛主席的领导下，以坚定不移的步伐，奔向社会主义和共产主义无限光辉的前程！
    可以毫不夸张地说，这幅画是一部光彩夺目的英雄史诗。它的出现有力地证明了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法的胜利。作者们为了这幅画的创作，曾进行过多方面的采访和研究，并设计了数以百计的草图和习作。在创作的过程中他们还提出了“以英雄的气概画英雄，以时代的感情写时代”的要求，先后经过两个月才创作完成。目前，我们看到的还只是素描稿，其中有些人物的创造和细节的描绘还有待再深一步的刻划，相信将来在画油画时一定会得到加工和提高，从而使这幅画更加完美。让亿万人民都来同声高歌颂赞我们的当代英雄吧！
