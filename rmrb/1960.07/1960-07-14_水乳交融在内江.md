    Intimate Integration in Neijiang
　　Chen Tianmin, First Secretary of the CPC Neijiang Municipal Committee, Sichuan
    The mass movement of industry supporting agriculture is like a spring flower, blooming in the cities and villages of the motherland. Our Neijiang City, like all other parts of the country, has seen a high tide of support for agriculture sweep through the city and various factories. Selflessness, putting others first, and doing everything possible to support agriculture have become a new social ethos. During this year's spring plowing season, farmers felt strained by labor shortages. To avoid delaying the farming season, the city organized a support-spring-plowing army of over 10,000 people, focusing on intensive work for ten days, completing over 130,000 labor-days, and finishing early rice transplanting on time. When a severe spring drought threatened the harvest of early spring crops, factories immediately deployed equipment and technical personnel, working overnight to help build seven pumping stations, irrigating more than 13,500 mu of farmland, and overcoming the spring drought. When spring sowing urgently needed fertilizer, the city launched a mass movement of everyone accumulating and delivering fertilizer, sending more than 5 million jin of compost and 210,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and pesticides to the countryside in a timely manner. And when the early spring harvest was imminent and farm work was busy, the city's twenty-two factories rushed ahead of the harvest, demarcating areas, fixing points, dividing responsibilities, and working with all their might, day and night. In just a few days, they helped the three communes in the city's suburbs build an "assembly line" of agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, enabling the early spring crops to be harvested, threshed, dried, stored, processed, and used locally, saving more than 360,000 labor-days throughout the year. These timely and selfless assistance efforts have played an extremely important role in promoting the development of agricultural production.
    In the movement to support agriculture, the working class has promoted the communist spirit of "taking the world as its responsibility," regarding supporting agriculture as its own unshirkable and glorious task. They have tried every possible means to overcome numerous difficulties and labor heroically for the needs of agriculture. When workers at the Tuojiang Power Machinery Factory heard that farmers needed boilers, they immediately formed a shock team, adopting a "three-pronged approach" of processing, assembling, and installing the machine base simultaneously, working non-stop for three days and three nights to rush-produce a boiler that had not been successfully assembled for more than half a year. It was transported to the commune overnight, installed, and put into production. To help rural areas build pumping stations, workers at the Neijiang Power Plant enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, actively made suggestions, and carried out innovations, adjusting production equipment and extracting more than forty kinds of electrical materials worth more than 5,000 yuan to establish five pumping stations, enabling the mechanization of drainage and irrigation for more than 4,000 mu of land near the factory. The farmers were very grateful and enthusiastically praised: "Workers' enthusiasm soars to the heavens, the Yangtze River flows over thousands of high slopes, drainage and irrigation are mechanized, ensuring a bumper harvest despite drought or flood." Many workers consciously took time out of their spare time to help repair machines in the countryside and teach technology. If there was no drill press, they would use a carpenter's drill bit; if farmers didn't understand blueprints, they would use mud to make models and explain the technical principles. The working class's selfless support, without conditions or remuneration, greatly stimulated the farmers' enthusiasm for labor, further enhanced the farmers' socialist consciousness, and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. They said: "Workers and peasants are of one mind, barren land can also turn into gold, united in one effort, socialism will be built early."
    The working class's communist style of selflessness and altruism is the style of our great era and a huge force for building socialism at high speed. To ensure the comprehensive and sustained great leap forward of the national economy, it's necessary to implement a policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, combining priority development of heavy industry with rapid development of agriculture. In particular, Neijiang City, known as the "Sweet City," has an industrial output value mainly based on sugar and wine, accounting for more than 80% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Industry and agriculture, workers and peasants, have an intimate and inseparable connection.
    The development of agriculture determines the leap forward of industry. Developing agriculture is not only a matter for farmers but also the responsibility of the working class. Therefore, we must further promote the communist style of the working class and carry out the mass movement of industry supporting agriculture more widely.

    水乳交融在内江
　　中共四川内江市委第一书记　陈天民
    工业支援农业的群众运动，有如春天的花朵，盛开在祖国的城市和村庄。我们内江市也和全国各地一样，支援农业的高潮，席卷了城市和各个工厂，大公无私，先人后己，千方百计地支援农业，已形成了一种新的社会风尚。在今年春耕时节，农民感到劳力紧张，为了不误农时，城市组织了一万余人的支援春耕大军，集中突击十天，做了十三万多个劳动日，按时完成了早稻插秧；当春旱严重威胁着小春丰收的时候，工厂立即抽出设备和技术力量，连夜突击帮助建立七个抽水机站，灌溉田土一万三千五百多亩，战胜了春旱；当春播急需肥料的时候，全市又开展了人人积肥、送肥的群众运动，把五百多万斤堆肥和二十一万多斤化肥、农药，及时送下了农村；而当小春丰收在即，农事繁忙的时候，全市二十二个工厂又赶在收获的前面，划片定点，分工包干，全力以赴，日夜奋战，在短短的几天中，就帮助市郊三个公社建成了农副产品加工机械“一条龙”，使小春能够就地收获、就地脱粒、就地翻晒、就地保管、就地加工和就地使用，全年可节约劳动日三十六万多个。这些及时的无私帮助，对促进农业生产的发展起到了极其重要的作用。
    在支援农业的运动中，工人阶级发扬了“以天下为己任”的共产主义精神，把支援农业看成是自己责无旁贷的光荣任务。他们千方百计，突破重重困难，为农业的需要而英勇劳动。沱江动力机器厂职工听说农民需要锅炉，立即组成了一支突击队伍，采取边加工、边组合、边安机脚“三管齐下”的办法，三天三夜不下火线，把一台半年多没有装制成功的锅炉抢制出来，连夜运到公社安装起来，投入了生产。内江电厂职工，为了帮助农村建立抽水机站，热烈响应党的号召，积极提建议，搞革新，调整生产设备，抽出电气材料四十余种，价值五千多元，建立了抽水机站五个，使工厂附近的四千多亩土地，实现了排溉机械化，农民非常感激，满腔热情的称颂：“工人干劲冲牛斗，万里高坡江水流、排灌实现机械化，旱涝也要保丰收”。许多工人自觉地抽出业余时间到农村帮助修理机器，传授技术。没有钻床，就用木工的钻花，农民不懂图纸，就用泥巴捏模型，讲解技术原理。工人阶级这种不讲条件、不计报酬的无私支援，大大激发了农民的劳动热情，进一步提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，巩固了工农联盟。他们说：“工人农民一条心，黄土也要变成金，齐心合力一股劲，社会主义早建成”。
    工人阶级的大公无私、舍己为人的共产主义风格，是我们伟大时代的风格，是高速度建设社会主义的巨大力量。要保证国民经济全面地持续大跃进，必须贯彻发展国民经济以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针。特别是内江市，素有“甜城”之称，以糖、酒为主的工业总产值占工农业总产值的80％以上，工业与农业、工人与农民有着水乳交融不可分割的联系。
    农业的发展，决定着工业的跃进，发展农业不仅是农民的事情，也是工人阶级的责任。因此，我们必须进一步发扬工人阶级的共产主义风格，把工业支援农业的群众运动更加广泛地开展起来。
