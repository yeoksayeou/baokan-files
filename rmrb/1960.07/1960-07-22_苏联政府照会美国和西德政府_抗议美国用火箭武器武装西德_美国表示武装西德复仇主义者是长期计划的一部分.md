Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - The Soviet government delivered notes to the U.S. and West German governments on the 19th, strongly protesting the U.S. arming of the West German Federal Defense Forces with U.S. "Polaris" rockets. These notes were delivered on the 19th by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to U.S. Charge d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Freers, and West German Charge d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Knock.

    In its note to the U.S. government, the Soviet government pointed out that West German Defense Minister Strauss's visit to the U.S., followed by U.S. Army Secretary Brucker's visit to West Germany, and their statements regarding arming the West German army with "Polaris" rockets, were premeditated, mutually consulted actions, the purpose of which was to accustom world public opinion to the open arming of West Germany with nuclear weapons.

    The Soviet note stated that it is very clear that the U.S. does not want to take any effective measures on disarmament, and that all its actions are aimed at a directly opposite goal—not only to accelerate armaments in the U.S. itself, but also to accelerate armaments in those countries that have military treaty relations with the U.S. The note emphasized that the U.S. government's actions not only seriously undermine the solemn obligations it shares with other countries that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany, namely, to ensure the establishment of conditions so that Germany can never again threaten its neighbors or world peace, but also directly hand over weapons of great destructive power to the West German army commanded by former Hitler generals, weapons that they might use for new aggression.

    In its note, the Soviet government most seriously warned the U.S. government that the path it is taking harbors dangerous consequences for the cause of peace and the security of the peoples of Europe, and that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for these consequences. The note stated that the Soviet government will have to take the countermeasures it deems necessary to ensure the security of the Soviet Union and its allies, and to ensure peace in Europe and the world.

    In its note to the West German government, the Soviet government emphasized that the West German government's war preparations prove that the policies of the West German ruling clique are entirely based on escalating the arms race and maintaining tensions between countries.

    The note stated that, based on the obligation not to allow German militarism to be revived, the Soviet government warns the West German government that it must bear full responsibility for its current actions and for all the possible consequences that may arise from retaliatory actions due to the aforementioned actions.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th - Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Soldatov, called on British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the 20th. Entrusted by the Soviet government, he urged the British government to pay attention to the increasing danger to the cause of peace brought about by the measures taken by the U.S. and West Germany to equip the West German "Defense Forces" with the latest missiles—nuclear weapons.

    Soldatov said that the Soviet government hopes the United Kingdom will explain its attitude toward the U.S. and West German attempt to equip the West German "Defense Forces" with "Polaris" missiles.

    The Soviet Ambassador handed over to the British Foreign Office copies of the Soviet government's notes to the U.S. and West German governments regarding the U.S.-West German military negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st - The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 20th regarding the Soviet protest against the U.S. arming West Germany with "Polaris" missiles, brazenly stating that the U.S. insists on its policy of arming the West German revanchist army with nuclear missiles in preparation for launching a war of aggression.

    U.S. State Department press officer White, in a statement read in Washington on the 20th, which Western journalists called "strongly worded," proclaimed that "meeting the needs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for intermediate-range ballistic missiles" is part of the "long-term plan" of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to expand armaments and prepare for war. It emphasized that "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must continue to strengthen its defense forces," and clamored that "the United States and its allies will not depart from the position of jointly taking the measures they deem necessary for their defense."

    The State Department's statement attempted to conceal the serious threat to world peace caused by the U.S. rearming of West Germany. It insisted that this "does not constitute a threat to anyone."

    The U.S. State Department's statement also launched malicious attacks on the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. It described the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals to normalize the situation in West Berlin as attempts to "impose a tyrannical system on the free people of Berlin."

    The statement also counterattacked, slandering the Soviet Union's support for the just positions of the people of the Congo and the people of Cuba against foreign aggression and intervention as so-called "deliberately escalating tensions."

    苏联政府照会美国和西德政府
    抗议美国用火箭武器武装西德
    美国表示武装西德复仇主义者是长期计划的一部分
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联政府19日分别照会美国和西德政府，坚决抗议用美国
  “北极星”式火箭武装西德联邦国防军。这些照会已于19日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给美国驻苏联临时代办弗里尔斯和西德驻苏联临时代办诺克。
    苏联政府在给美国政府的照会中指出，西德国防部长施特劳斯访问美国、随后美国陆军部长布鲁克访问西德，以及他们关于用“北极星”式火箭武装西德军队的声明，是蓄谋的、一致协商好的行动，其目的是要使世界舆论习惯于用核武器公开武装西德。
    苏联照会说，十分明显，美国不想在裁军方面采取任何有效的措施，它的一切行动都是为了达到一个直接相反的目标——不仅竭力在美国本国加速武装，而且竭力在同美国有军事条约关系的那些国家中加速武装。照会强调指出，美国政府的行动不仅严重地破坏了它同其他参加对希特勒德国作战的国家共同承担的庄严义务，即保证建立这样的条件，以便使德国永远再不能威胁邻国或者威胁世界和平，而且把破坏力很大的武器直接交到前希特勒将领统率的西德军队手中，而这种武器是可能被他们用来进行新的侵略的。
    苏联政府在照会中最严重地警告美国政府，它正在走的道路对和平和欧洲各国人民安全的事业包藏着危险的后果，美国政府要对这些后果负完全的责任。照会说，苏联政府将不得不采取它认为为了保障苏联及苏联的盟国的安全、为了保障欧洲和世界和平所必须的对策。
    苏联政府在给西德政府的照会中强调指出，西德政府进行的备战活动证明，西德统治集团的政策完全是建立在加剧军备竞赛和保持国与国之间紧张状态的基础上。
    照会说，苏联政府根据关于不得使德国军国主义复活的义务，警告西德政府，它要对它现在的行动以及由于上述行动而可能引起的报复行动所可能产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社伦敦20日讯：苏联驻英国大使索尔达多夫20日拜会了英国外交大臣劳埃德。他受苏联政府的委托，促请英国政府注意美国和西德所采取的、用最新式的导弹—核武器装备西德“国防军”的措施给和平事业带来越来越大的危险。
    索尔达多夫说，苏联政府希望英国解释它对美国和西德企图用“北极星”式导弹装备西德“国防军”一事的态度。
    苏联大使把苏联政府就美国—西德军事谈判给美国和西德政府的照会的副本交给了英国外交部。
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院20日就苏联抗议美国以“北极星”式导弹武装西德的照会发表声明，悍然表示美国坚持它以核导弹武装西德复仇主义军队准备发动侵略战争的政策。
    美国国务院新闻发布官怀特20日在华盛顿宣读的这份被西方记者称为“措辞强硬”的声明，扬言“满足北大西洋公约组织对中程弹道导弹的需要”是北大西洋侵略集团扩军备战的“长期计划的一部分”。它强调“北大西洋公约组织必须继续加强它的防务力量”，并且叫嚷说，“美国和它的盟国不会离开联合采取它们认为为它们的防务所必需的措施的立场。”
    国务院的声明妄图掩饰美国重新武装西德对世界和平造成的严重威胁。它硬说这“并不构成对任何人的威胁”。
    美国国务院的声明还对苏联和德意志民主共和国发出恶毒的攻击。它把苏联使西柏林局势正常化的合理主张说成是企图“以暴虐制度强加在柏林自由人民头上”。
    声明还反咬一口，诬蔑苏联支持刚果人民和古巴人民对外国侵略和干涉的正义立场是所谓“蓄意加剧紧张局势”。
