　　Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Ideological Work
　　Yi Qing
    To do a good job in production, leading cadres must be down-to-earth, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and do a good job in political and ideological work. The example of the leading cadres of the Julong Branch Party Branch going deep among the masses and doing a good job in ideological work, so that the production organization quickly embarked on healthy development, fully illustrates this truth.

    Political ideology is the commander and soul, and doing a good job in it can drive all work forward with leaps and bounds. This is a truth that everyone knows. How can we do a good job in political and ideological work? In addition to generally conducting political and ideological education, it is very important to carry out specific education in light of the specific ideological conditions of the masses. In our country, the common thought of the people is to love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism. However, how much progress will our cause make in a certain period? Why is a specific task done this way and not that way? Not everyone can understand this. Taking the urban people's commune as an example: the broad masses of urban people warmly welcome this new thing and actively participate in various production undertakings. However, what is the policy of street production? What is the direction of operation? How is the entire street production moving forward? It is not very clear. At the same time, people actively support and enthusiastically support street production, but there may be differences in their views on some specific things. For example, most production personnel have high enthusiasm, but a few people have just left their homes and are not used to collective production for a while. These fully illustrate that in addition to conducting general political and ideological education for the masses, we must prescribe the right medicine in light of the specific ideological conditions of each period, and conduct education in a targeted manner. Lenin said: The living soul of Marxism lies in the concrete analysis of concrete situations. Not only in all economic work, we must be good at grasping this living soul, but also in political and ideological work, we must grasp it. "One key opens one lock," and our political and ideological work will be full of vitality, flesh and blood, and lively.

    The experience of the Julong Branch Party Branch conscientiously going deep into reality, going deep among the masses, and going deep into the front line of production to do a good job in political and ideological work shows that only by going deep down and truly becoming one with the masses can the masses regard you as a true "confidant" and "intimate person," and can they tell you their innermost thoughts without reservation. Leading cadres can also deeply appreciate the ideological feelings of the masses, truly understand the requirements of the people of all strata, and after analysis and research, then grasp the main and fundamental ideological problems and educate the masses.

    Now, urban communes are developing further, and urban commune party organizations should, like the Julong Branch Party Branch, go deep into the masses and conscientiously carry out political and ideological work to push urban communes forward.

　　踏踏实实做好思想工作
　　怡清
    要搞好生产，领导干部必须踏踏实实，深入群众，深入实际，做好政治思想工作。巨龙分社党支部的领导干部深入群众，做好思想工作，使生产组织迅速走上健康发展的事例，充分说明了这个道理。
    政治思想是统帅是灵魂，做好它，就能带动各项工作跃进，这是大家知道的道理。究竟怎样才能做好政治思想工作呢？除了一般地进行政治思想教育以外，很重要的一点就是要针对群众的具体思想情况，进行具体教育。在我们国家里，人们的共同思想是热爱共产党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义。但是，在一定时期里，我们的事业究竟前进多少？某一项具体工作为什么这样做，而不那样做？就不是每个人所能了解的。以城市人民公社为例：广大城市人民热烈欢迎这一新生事物，并且积极参加各项生产事业。但是，人们对于街道生产的方针是什么？经营方向又如何？整个街道生产怎样前进？就不能了解得很清楚。同时，人们对街道生产是积极拥护，热情支持的，但对一些具体事物的看法，有时也会有差异。比如大多数生产人员热情高，也有少数人刚走出家门，对集体生产一时还不习惯。这些都充分说明：我们除了对群众进行一般的政治思想教育以外，必须针对每个时期的具体思想情况，对症下药，有的放矢地进行教育。列宁说过：马克思主义的活的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体情况。不仅在一切经济工作中，要善于抓住这个活的灵魂，在政治思想工作中，也要抓住它。“一把钥匙开一把锁”，我们的政治思想工作才是富有生命力的，有血有肉的，生动活泼的。
    巨龙分社党支部踏踏实实地深入实际，深入群众，深入生产第一线做好政治思想工作的经验说明，只有深入下去和群众真正打成一片，群众才能把你当成真正的“知己朋友”、“贴心人”，才能知无不言，言无不尽地说出他们的心里话。而领导干部也就可以深刻体会到群众的思想感情，真正了解到各阶层人民群众的要求，经过分析、研究，然后抓住主要的、带根本性的思想问题，对群众进行教育。
    现在，城市公社正在进一步发展，城市公社党组织应当像巨龙分社党支部那样，深入到群众中去，踏踏实实地进行政治思想工作，将城市公社推向前进。
