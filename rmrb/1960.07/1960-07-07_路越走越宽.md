　　The Road Gets Wider and Wider
　　Yao Renwei

　　What others can do, can I do? If others do well, can I do even better? Xie Wen, a worker at the Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, boldly reformed the high-voltage bridge (see page 2 of this newspaper on June 17), giving us a positive answer.

　　The thought that initially flashed through Xie Wen's mind, "If it could be changed, someone would have changed it long ago," is a common one. The key is what attitude should ultimately be adopted to deal with this issue: Are you overwhelmed by inferiority and willing to lag behind others, or are you inspired and encouraged by the creative inventions of others, and step up to spur yourself on, determined to catch up with and surpass others? Obviously, Xie Wen adopted the latter attitude.

　　The value of this attitude and thought lies in the fact that it has both the possibility of realization and a full theoretical basis. This is what Chairman Mao put forward: "The movement of change in the objective real world is never-ending, and people's understanding of the truth in practice is also never-ending." This should be an unbreakable objective law. But mastering and applying this objective law still depends on us.

　　Fearlessly approaching everything and using our abundant energy to make them vibrant is the most active attitude of the revolution. To do this, we must first believe in our own strength so that we can stand firm and move forward; otherwise, we will be unstable and wavering. Second, we should not regard the peaks that others have climbed as insurmountable limits, but as the starting point for our own ascent to new peaks. We must have the heroic ambition and the spirit of hard work and solid work: "The majestic pass is really like iron, but now we are stepping forward from the beginning."

　　The road is made by people, and the road only gets wider and wider as we walk it. Since Wang Linhe has already taken a big step on the road of cutting-edge science in our country, and Xie Wen has indeed started from the starting point created by Wang Linhe and climbed a new peak, then what reason do we have not to believe that there will soon be a second and third Xie Wen who will catch up quickly, overtake from behind, and surpass them?

    路越走越宽
    姚人为
    别人能做到的，我能不能做到？别人做好了，我能不能做得更好些？上海沪光科学仪器厂工人谢文大胆改革高压电桥这件事（见6月17日本报二版），给我们作出了肯定的答案。
    在谢文脑中最初闪过“要能改，别人早就改了”的念头，也是一般人所常有的。关键是最终应该采取什么态度来对待这个问题：你是被自卑感压倒、甘心落在别人后面呢，还是从别人的创造发明中得到启发、鼓舞，并且加紧鞭策自己、立志赶上别人、超过别人？显然，谢文采取的是后一种态度。
    这种态度和思想之所以可贵，是因为既有实现的可能性，也有充分的理论根据。这就是毛主席所提出的：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”这应该是一条颠扑不破的客观规律。但是掌握和运用这条客观规律的还在于我们的人。
    无所畏惧地接触一切事物，用自己充沛的精力使它们变得生气勃勃。这是革命最积极的态度。做到这样，首先要相信自己的力量，才可以落定脚跟，迈步向前；不然的话，就会立足不稳，摇摆不定。第二，不把别人登上的高峰看作不可超越的极限，而要看成是自己攀登新高峰的起点。要有“雄关漫道真如铁，而今漫步从头越”的豪情壮志和苦干实干精神。
    路是人走出来的，而且路只有越走越宽。王林鹤既然在我国尖端科学的道路上已经闯出了一大步，谢文又果然从王林鹤创造的起点出发，攀登了新的高峰；那么，我们有什么理由不相信不久还有第二第三个谢文将会急起直追、迎头赶上，而且后来居上呢？
