　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 9th: An Algerian official told a Middle East News Agency reporter today that de Gaulle's recent statement has widened the divisions between the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and the French government on the peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue.

　　The official also said that after failing to deceive world public opinion, de Gaulle has been forced to remove his mask and reveal the imperialist face of the French government.

　　The official concluded by saying that the Algerian people will continue their struggle until they achieve their just goals.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 9th: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station here broadcast last night that the preliminary talks held in Melun between the Algerian Provisional Government and the French government proved that our enemy has always opposed our independence. Therefore, we have no other way but through armed struggle.

　　The radio station pointed out that de Gaulle's talk of "freedom" and "self-determination" aims to deceive world opinion, while also attempting to "appease" the French people's increasingly strong opposition to the French government due to its dirty war of aggression against Algeria.

　　The radio station concluded by saying that de Gaulle's policy in Algeria is to continue the imperialist war on the one hand, and to deceive world opinion on the other.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 9th: French President de Gaulle, who is currently traveling in the provinces of Normandy, delivered a series of speeches on the Algerian issue for three consecutive days on the 6th, 7th, and 8th.

　　In these speeches, de Gaulle reaffirmed the French government's colonialist attitude towards Algeria. He said that resolving the Algerian issue "first requires stopping the war," and he said, "This is what we have already suggested to those people (referring to the Algerian government)."

　　French imperialism wants to firmly seize Algeria, as de Gaulle repeatedly stated in his speeches. He repeatedly emphasized that Algeria must maintain a so-called "close" relationship with France, saying that this is "the path that should be taken there (referring to Algeria)." He also said that Algeria "needs to closely link its destiny with the destiny of France."

　　De Gaulle mentioned the preliminary talks between France and Algeria held in Melun not long ago in his speeches. He said that it was "impossible" for France to recognize the Provisional Government of Algeria; he also said that the Algerian delegation "also wanted the freedom to go to Paris, to meet the press and their friends," and "this is impossible."

　　Before leaving Paris for Normandy, de Gaulle presided over a cabinet meeting on the 6th to discuss the Melun talks. Minister of Information Terrenoire said after the cabinet meeting that the cabinet reviewed the Melun talks, but no new plan was proposed at the meeting.

　　阿尔及利亚舆论抨击戴高乐声明
　　阿尔及利亚人民决心以斗争求独立
　　戴高乐发表演说叫嚷要继续侵略阿尔及利亚
    新华社开罗9日电　一位阿尔及利亚负责人士今天对中东通讯社记者说，戴高乐最近发表的声明在和平解决阿尔及利亚问题方面扩大了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府和法国政府之间的分歧。
    这位人士还说，戴高乐在没有能够欺骗世界公众舆论之后，已经被迫取下假面具露出法国政府的帝国主义面貌。
    这位人士最后说，阿尔及利亚人民将继续进行斗争，直到实现他们的正义的目的为止。
    新华社开罗9日电　这里的“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台昨晚广播说：阿尔及利亚临时政府和法国政府在默伦举行的预备谈判证明，我们的敌人始终反对我们的独立，因此，我们除了通过武装斗争之外没有别的途径。
    电台指出，戴高乐高谈“自由”和“自决”，目的是欺骗世界舆论，同时并企图“平息”法国人民由于法国政府进行肮脏的侵阿战争而对它日益强烈的反对。
    电台最后说：戴高乐在阿尔及利亚的政策就是一面继续进行帝国主义战争，一面欺骗世界舆论。
    新华社巴黎9日电　目前正在诺曼第各省旅行的法国总统戴高乐6日、7日和8日三天接连就阿尔及利亚问题发表一连串演说。
    戴高乐在这些演说中重新表明法国政府对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义态度。他说，解决阿尔及利亚问题“首先必需停止战争”，他说，“这就是我们已经向那些人（指阿尔及利亚政府）建议的”。
    法国帝国主义要牢牢地攫住阿尔及利亚，这是戴高乐在演说中所一再表明了的。他一再强调，阿尔及利亚必须同法国保持所谓“密切的”联系，他说，这是“那里（指阿尔及利亚）应该走的道路”。他还说，阿尔及利亚“需要把它的命运同法国的命运密切联系在一起”。
    戴高乐在各次演说中都谈到了不久前在默伦举行的法国同阿尔及利亚之间的预备会谈。他说，要法国承认阿尔及利亚临时政府，“那是办不到的”；他还说，阿尔及利亚代表团“还想得到到巴黎去的自由、去会见报界和他们的朋友”，“这是不可能的”。
    戴高乐在离开巴黎到诺曼第去以前，曾在6日主持了讨论默伦会谈的内阁会议。宣传部长戴雷诺瓦在内阁会议后说，内阁审查了默伦会谈，但是在会议上没有提出新的计划。
