On the Production Front Lines

	Drums and gongs resound, red flags flutter, the front lines are a hive of activity, determined to turn all the yellow earth into gold, making our great motherland shine brilliantly. The county party secretary, wearing a bamboo hat and holding a gleaming new sickle, with his work point ledger and notebook, has come to the rice paddies where the waves are rising. He sets up a telephone under a poplar tree, and a smooth flagstone serves as his desk. Ten years ago he commanded battles here, and now he is here again, directing production. Liberation brand trucks are parked by the roadside, and worker comrades have come to the countryside. They bring gifts to the commune: water pumps, harvesters, and electrical wires. They don’t drink tea or smoke cigarettes, and they don’t bother wiping the sweat from their brows, but ask again and again: are there any other difficulties? Liberation Army comrades also come to support, the leading captain radiating good cheer, he rushes to the young production team leader and embraces him tightly: "Do you remember me, old partner? On that unforgettable night of crossing the Yangtze River, you rowed your fishing boat and sent us to the south bank amidst the gunfire..." Banners flutter past the willow trees, the dust on the road rises high, and middle school teachers and students, taking advantage of the holiday, send large quantities of fertilizer to the commune. A banner leads the way, with a resounding slogan written on it: Vigorously support agricultural production, resolutely respond to the call of the Party! The wind parts the green bamboo on both sides, and a string of red flowers appears beside the mountain. It turns out that the cultural troupe has come to the countryside to perform, and silver bell-like songs are rippling across the fields. The land is the stage, the fields are the theater, no need for curtains or makeup, first a section of Luju "Borrowing Clothes," then a section of Yuju "Hong Niang." The salesperson has also come to the fields, the bamboo pole swaying gently, towels, straw hats, and daily necessities are all neatly carried on the shoulder. She walks along asking questions, her smiling face dark and shiny, the load on her shoulder gets lighter and lighter, and people praise her with satisfaction. Who is pulling up the tarpaulin tent on the side of the mountain? From a distance, it looks like a full sail, it turns out to be the bookstore's staff comrade, who has set up his bookstall there. The commune members rest, he starts to work, the commune members go to the fields, he also goes to the fields, he brings Chairman Mao's great works, and also beautiful and moving poems. Doctors and nurses also break with routine, walk out of the clinics, walk out of the hospitals, stethoscopes placed in their pockets, health kits carried by their sides. Crossing water when there is water, crossing mountains when there are mountains, they don't care about hardship and fatigue, with deep and sincere class feelings, guarding the health of all commune members. Drums and gongs resound, red flags flutter, the front lines are a hive of activity, look, the fields of the motherland are like gold inlaid with jade, a great harvest is in sight.

    在生产第一线
    严阵锣鼓喧腾，红旗招展，第一线上热火朝天，决心叫黄土全变成黄金，让伟大的祖国金光闪闪。县委书记戴上箬帽，手里握着雪亮的新镰，身上带着记工本和记事本，来到了稻浪起伏的田间。把电话机安在白杨树下，办公桌就是光滑的石板，十年前他在这里指挥过战斗，如今又在这里指挥生产。解放牌汽车停在路边，工人同志来到了乡间，他们为公社带来了礼物：抽水机收割机还有电线。他们一不喝茶二不抽烟，也顾不得擦那满头的汗，只一声接着一声问道：还有没有什么其它困难？解放军同志也来支援，带队的大尉红光满面，他奔向年轻的生产队长，紧紧地抱住了他的双肩：“还记得我吗？老伙伴，在横渡长江那难忘的夜晚，你曾划着你捕鱼的小船，炮火中把我们送到江南……”彩旗招展飘过柳梢，大路上的尘土扬起多高，中学的师生趁着假日，为公社送来了大批肥料。横幅标语在前面开路，上面写着响亮的口号：大力支援农业生产，坚决响应党的号召！风吹绿竹分向两边，一串红花出现在山旁，原来是文工团下乡演出，银铃般的歌声在田野上荡漾。地是舞台，田是剧场，用不着幕布用不着化装，先来一段庐剧借罗衣，再唱一段豫剧红娘。售货员也到田头来了，毛竹扁担悠悠地晃，手巾草帽日用百货，都齐齐全全地挑在肩上。她一路走着一路问着，微笑的脸颊黑里透亮，担子一路上轻了下来，人们都满意地把她夸奖。是谁在山边上拉起了布篷？远望似一只饱鼓鼓的风帆，原来是书店的营业员同志，在那儿摆开了他的书摊。社员休息他开始工作，社员下田他也下田，他带来毛主席的伟大著作，也带有美丽动人的诗篇。医生护士也打破常规，走出诊疗室，走出医院，听诊器放在上衣口袋里，保健箱带在他们的身边。逢水过水，逢山过山，他们顾不得辛苦疲倦，以深厚亲切的阶级感情，守护着全体社员的康健。锣鼓喧腾，红旗招展，第一线上热火朝天，看，祖国的田野似金镶玉嵌，一个伟大的丰收就在眼前。
