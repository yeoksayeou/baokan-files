Xinhua News Agency, July 12th, New Delhi Dispatch: Indian government employees, in order to improve their living conditions and increase their wages, have begun their strike as scheduled from midnight on July 11th, despite laws banning strikes and various repressive measures. A July 11th report from the Press Trust of India stated that the scale of this strike "is the largest unprecedented one in this country."

According to a July 11th report from the Press Trust of India, in Bombay, all on-duty personnel at the Central Telegraph Office went on strike. In Calcutta, all flight personnel at Dum Dum Airport went on strike. In Madras State, many airport personnel also joined the strike.

Bombay's "Free Press" said today, "Civil aviation workers at Santa Cruz Airport (Bombay), led by female telephone operators, left their posts." "All employees of the City Telephone Bureau, except for management personnel, walked out of their offices at 12:15 AM." The newspaper added, "At the General Post Office, more than 90% of the night shift employees walked out of their offices."

According to today's "Hindustan Times," railway and postal departments in Calcutta held a complete strike. According to a United Press International report from Calcutta, as the clock struck twelve at midnight on the 11th, employees of the city's central post office and other agencies "put down their pens." "Armed police patrolled the city." At midnight, strikers began shouting slogans, "but were quickly sent to prison by police and troops guarding all important facilities."

Currently, a full picture of the strike is not yet available. According to the Press Trust of India, "The Madras State government has instructed government officials not to meet with reporters or discuss any news about the strike situation."

According to Agence France-Presse on July 12th, citing broadcasts from All India Radio, the Indian government has so far arrested 550 people who have defied the government's ban on strikes.

According to the Press Trust of India, in Dohad, Gujarat State, police used tear gas and iron-tipped clubs to disperse crowds, and opened fire to suppress them, killing one person.

The report also said that many cities have ordered bans on gatherings and demonstrations. In the Indian Central Government's direct jurisdiction of Delhi, all demonstrations, gatherings, and parades without permission have also been banned in order to "deal with dangerous situations." According to a July 11th Reuters report, seven thousand police and guards occupied some strategic strongholds in the city, "Helmeted police marched into the grounds of the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi," "They also guarded the main telephone exchange and deployed vanguard units of radio communication troops at the two main train stations."

Xinhua News Agency, July 11th, New Delhi Dispatch: After negotiations between the Indian government and representatives of government employees on the strike issue failed, the government arrested several leaders of the strike organization in the capital this morning.

According to the Press Trust of India, the Action Committee of the Federation of Government Employees Unions had negotiated with Feroze Gandhi, Prime Minister Nehru's son-in-law and a Congress Party member of parliament, for a whole day on the 10th. The report said that Gandhi had been in constant contact with Prime Minister Nehru, Home Minister Pant, and Labor Minister Nanda. According to today's "Statesman," "The Indian government has ordered the complete dismissal of all civil servants participating in the strike." The "Times of India" also reported that the Indian government "has issued instructions to the heads of all departments, ordering them to take swift disciplinary action against those who disobey orders. All temporary employees participating in the strike should be dismissed immediately, and permanent staff may be suspended or dismissed once arrested or convicted in court. Relevant departments may also take this opportunity to remove employees who are inefficient or otherwise unsuitable."

According to the "Times of India" on July 10th, "National Army forces are currently on alert to provide any assistance required by non-military authorities." The newspaper said that the Indian Central Government has notified state governments to use a total of approximately three million "Home Guards" to
  "protect important services."

The Indian government issued a circular on the 9th stating that, in view of the planned nationwide strike by central government employees, defense personnel can be used in the government's essential service departments. If a strike occurs, naval and air force personnel will go to work at important ports and airports. It is reported that Congress Party members are acting on instructions to recruit "volunteers" everywhere to serve when service departments go on strike. Newspapers reported that the government also plans to use a large number of unemployed people registered with the government seeking employment to replace striking government employees.

    新华社12日讯　新德里消息，印度政府雇员为了要求改善生活提高工资，不顾禁止罢工的法令和各种镇压措施，如期从7月11日午夜起开始罢工。印度报业托辣斯11日的消息说，这次罢工的规模“是这个国家空前最大的一次”。
    据印度报业托辣斯11日报道，在孟买，中心电报局的全体值班人员全都罢了工。在加尔各答，达姆达姆机场的飞行人员全都罢了工。在马德拉斯邦，许多机场人员也参加了罢工。
    孟买的“自由新闻”今天说，“（孟买）圣克卢斯机场的民航工作人员由女接线生带头离开了他们的工作岗位”。“市电话局除了管理人员外的全部职工，在午夜十二时一刻走出了他们的办公室。”报纸又说，“在邮政总局，夜班职工90％以上走出了他们的办公室”。
    据今天的“印度斯坦时报”说，加尔各答的铁路和邮政部门都举行了彻底的罢工。据合众国际社从加尔各答报道说，当11日午夜时钟一敲十二下，这个城市中心邮局等机关的雇员就“搁下了钢笔”。“武装警察在市内巡逻”。午夜时分，罢工者开始高呼口号，“但很快就被守卫着一切重要设施的警察和军队送往监狱了。”
    目前，罢工的全面情况还无法知道。据印度报业托辣斯报道，“马德拉斯邦政府已经指示政府官员不应当会见记者，或者谈论任何关于罢工情况的消息。”
    据法新社12日援引全印广播电台的广播说，印度政府至今已逮捕了五百五十名不顾政府禁止罢工命令的人。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在古吉拉特邦的多哈德，警察用催泪弹和包铁皮的粗棍驱散群众，并开枪镇压，打死了一人。
    消息还说，许多城市已经下令禁止集会和示威游行。在德里的印度中央政府直辖区内也已经禁止举行一切未经许可的示威、集会和游行，以“对付危险局势”。据11日的路透社报道说，有七千名警察和警卫占据了这个城市的一些战略性据点，“头戴钢盔的警察开进了新德里的中央电报局的场地”，“他们还守卫着主要的电话交换局，在两个主要的火车站布置了无线电讯部队的先锋队”。
    新华社11日讯　新德里消息：印度政府在同政府雇员代表关于罢工问题的谈判失败后，今天清晨在首都逮捕了几名罢工组织的负责人。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，政府雇员工会联合会行动委员会10日曾同尼赫鲁总理的女婿、国大党议员费罗兹·甘地整整谈判了一天。消息说，甘地曾不断同尼赫鲁总理、内政部长潘特和劳工部长南达进行接触。据今天的“政治家报”报道说，“印度政府已下令全部开除所有参加罢工的文职人员。”“印度时报”也报道说，印度政府“已向所有部门的负责人发出指示，命令他们对违令的人员采取迅速的处分行动。参加罢工的所有临时雇员应予立即解雇，常用人员一旦被捕或在法庭上被判罪时可以予以停职或解雇处分。有关各部门还可能利用这个机会来除去效率不高或在其他方面不相宜的雇员。”
    据“印度时报”10日报道，目前“印度全国陆军部队正处于戒备状态，以便提供非军事当局所需要的任何援助。”这家报纸说，印度中央政府已通知各邦政府使用总数约三百万人的“自卫队”来
  “保护重要服务部门”。
    印度政府在9日发表了一项通告，通告说，鉴于中央政府雇员计划举行全国性罢工，政府的重要服务部门可以使用国防人员。如果举行罢工的话，海军和空军人员将到重要港口和机场去工作。据报道，国大党的党员根据指示正四出活动，招募服务部门罢工时的“志愿人员”。报纸报道说，政府还准备利用向政府登记急待就业的大批失业者来顶替罢工的政府雇员。
