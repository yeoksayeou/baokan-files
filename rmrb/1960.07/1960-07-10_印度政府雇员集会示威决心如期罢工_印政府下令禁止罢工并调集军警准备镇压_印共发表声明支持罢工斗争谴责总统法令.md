Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, New Delhi: Indian government employees have been holding rallies and demonstrations for days, expressing their determination to hold a strike as scheduled. At the same time, the Indian central government and various state governments are mobilizing military police and other forces to deal with the strike.

According to the "Statesman" report, thousands of employees of the central government system marched on the streets of Calcutta on July 7th in the pouring rain, reiterating their determination to strike. According to the Press Trust of India, employees of the central government system in Delhi also held group meetings, reiterating their demands. The "Mail" reported that more than 50,000 government employees paraded in Madras City on the evening of July 6th, guaranteeing their support for the strike. The "New Age" weekly reported that 5,000 workers from the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works held a five-mile-long parade, announcing their participation in the strike. In Bombay, 80,000 to 90,000 railway and defense agency workers are working to issue strike notices. On June 25th, a demonstration of 15,000 people was held in this city.

The "Hindustan Times" reported on the 8th that India's three major trade union organizations—the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian Labor Association, and the United Trade Union Congress—jointly called on Indian workers on the 7th to hold a one-day nationwide strike on July 14th to show their support for the employees of the central government system. The members of the above three trade unions are said to number three million.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 6th, expressing deep support and sympathy for government employees, and guaranteeing that the Communist Party of India "will firmly support their struggle." The Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of India issued another statement on the 8th, condemning the president's decree banning strikes, believing that this decree is "an attack on (workers') freedom of organization, collective bargaining, and valuable rights obtained through struggle."

According to the "Statesman" report on the 8th, Prime Minister Nehru has been busy consulting with people on the government employees' strike issue since returning to New Delhi from the Sino-Indian border area of Ladakh. The newspaper said that the Indian armed forces, especially the mechanized forces, have been asked to be ready to assist the civil administration at any time. At the same time, regional military forces have also been mobilized. According to the "Hindustan Flag," in Delhi, about 1,000 "self-defense forces" and regional military forces will assist 10,000 police officers to deal with the strike. The "Statesman" reported that the West Bengal government also intends to deploy 13,000 police officers to deal with the strike.

According to today's "Indian Express," Nat Pai, chairman of the Standing Committee of the "Joint Action Committee" representing 2.2 million employees of the Indian Central Government agencies, pointed out in a speech in Bombay that the decree issued by the Indian President on the 8th was "a notice to employees to surrender unconditionally." He said, "Our answer is a firm refusal to surrender."

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, New Delhi: According to the Press Trust of India, the Indian central government issued an order tonight declaring the strike, scheduled to begin at midnight on July 11th and involving approximately 2 million government employees, the largest strike in India since independence, as illegal.

Earlier today, Indian President Prasad issued a decree authorizing the Indian government to prohibit strikes in postal and telecommunications, railways, land, sea, and air transportation, and any other "essential services" deemed important by the government.

The Press Trust of India reported that police officers have been authorized to arrest strikers without a warrant, and courts can sentence strikers to imprisonment for up to six months or a fine of up to 200 rupees. Those who "incite strikers" will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine of up to 1,000 rupees, or both.

The news also said that according to this order of the Indian government, any central government employee who goes on strike and is convicted by a court for this reason will be automatically dismissed.

According to the Press Trust of India, the leaders who organized the strike rejected Nehru's demand that they call off the strike last night, regardless of the threatening broadcast speech of Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

    据“政治家报”报道，数千名中央政府系统的雇员7日冒着倾盆大雨在加尔各答街道上游行，重申要举行罢工的决心。据印度报业托辣斯报道，在德里的中央政府系统的雇员也举行小组会议，重申了他们的要求。“邮报”报道，五万多名政府雇员7月6日傍晚在马德拉斯城游行示威，保证支持罢工。“新世纪”周报报道，奇塔兰詹机车工厂的五千名工人举行了路程达五英里的游行，宣布参加罢工。在孟买，有八、九万名铁路和国防机构工人为发出罢工通知而工作。6月25日，在这个城市曾经举行有一万五千人参加的示威游行。
      “印度斯坦时报”8日的消息说，印度的三个主要工会组织——全印工会大会、印度劳工协会和统一工会大会——7日联合号召印度工人在7月14日举行一天的全国性罢工以表示支持中央政府系统的雇员。上述三个工会的会员据说有三百万。
    印度共产党全国委员会6日发表声明，表示深切支持和同情政府雇员，并保证印度共产党“将坚决支持他们的斗争”。印度共产党中央书记处8日又发表声明，谴责总统发布禁止罢工的法令，认为这一法令是“对（工人）组织自由、集体谈判和通过斗争取得的宝贵权利的进攻”。
    据8日的“政治家报”报道，尼赫鲁总理从中印边境拉达克地区回到新德里后，一直忙于同人们就政府雇员罢工问题进行磋商。这家报纸说，印度的武装部队特别是机械化部队已被要求随时准备好协助民政当局。同时，地区的军事部队也已经被动员起来。据“印度斯坦旗报”报道，在德里，将有一千名左右“自卫队”和地区军事部队协助一万名警察来对付罢工。“政治家报”报道，西孟加拉邦政府也打算出动一万三千名警察来对付罢工。
    据今天的“印度快报”报道，代表印度中央政府所属机构二百二十万雇员的“联合行动委员会”常设委员会主席纳特·帕伊在孟买发表谈话，指出印度总统8日颁布的法令是“通知雇员要他们无条件投降”。他说，“我们的答复是坚决不投降”。
    新华社8日讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度中央政府今晚下令宣布，预定从7月11日午夜开始的、有二百万左右政府雇员参加的、印度独立以来规模最大的一次罢工为非法。
    在今天早些时候，印度总统普拉沙德颁布了一项法令，授权印度政府禁止邮电、铁路、陆海空运输以及政府认为的任何其他“重要服务事业”罢工。
    印度报业托辣斯报道说，警官已被授权无需拘票就可对罢工者加以逮捕，同时法院可判处罢工者六个月以内的徒刑或二百卢比以内的罚款。所谓“煽动罢工者”将被判处一年以内徒刑，或一千卢比以内罚款，或者受双重处罚。
    消息还说，根据印度政府这一命令，任何一个中央政府雇员如果进行罢工并且因此被法院判罪后，将同时自动地被解雇。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，组织这次罢工的领导人昨天晚上不顾印度总理尼赫鲁的威胁性的广播演说，拒绝了尼赫鲁要他们取消这次罢工的要求。
