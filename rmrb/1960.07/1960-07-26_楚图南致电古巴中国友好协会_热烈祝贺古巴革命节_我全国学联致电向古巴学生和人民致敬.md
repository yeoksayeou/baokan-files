    Warmly Congratulating Cuban Revolution Day
    All-China Students' Federation Sends Telegram Paying Tribute to Cuban Students and People
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America, sent a telegram to the President of the Cuban-Chinese Friendship Association, congratulating him on July 26th - the festival of the Cuban people's revolution. The telegram reads as follows:
    To President Bartolomeo Alvarez Rios of the Cuban-Chinese Friendship Association:
    On the occasion of the Cuban people celebrating the July 26th Revolution Day, I, on behalf of the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America, extend warm congratulations and high respect to your association and, through your association, to the heroic Cuban people.
    Under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the leader of the glorious rebel army, the Cuban people, after a long and arduous armed struggle, finally overthrew the Batista reactionary dictatorship regime fostered by the United States. In order to safeguard national sovereignty, develop the national economy, and implement land reform, the Cuban people have continued their efforts to wage a resolute struggle against the US imperialist policy of interference and aggression. The Cuban people's firm struggle against US imperialism has set a shining example for the world and has won the support of people all over the world. I wish the Cuban people continuous and more glorious victories and achievements in their struggle to defend independence and oppose US imperialism, and in their cause of national economic and cultural construction.
    Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America
    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: On the eve of the international protest day against US imperialist economic aggression against Cuba on July 26th, the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram to the Cuban University Students' Federation, expressing its highest respect on behalf of all Chinese students to the heroic Cuban students and people standing at the forefront of the anti-US struggle.
    The telegram said that US imperialism, in order to strangle the Cuban revolution, has recently intensified its shameless economic pressure on Cuba and plotted military intervention. We express our strong condemnation of this. Chinese students and people fully support your just struggle against US imperialism, safeguarding national sovereignty, and developing the national economy. The people of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the world all stand with the Cuban people. We firmly believe that the US imperialist conspiracy of aggression against Cuba will inevitably be completely defeated, and the Cuban people, united and persevering in their struggle, will surely win new and greater victories in the anti-American patriotic and just struggle!
    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: On the eve of the international protest day against US imperialist economic aggression against Cuba on July 26th, the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram to the Latin American Student Relations Bureau, expressing that Chinese students and the people of the whole country fully support the just struggle of the Cuban people against US imperialism, safeguarding national sovereignty, and developing the national economy, and fully support the vigorously rising national democratic movement of the Latin American people. The telegram strongly condemned the US imperialists for intensifying their shameless economic pressure on Cuba and plotting military intervention in order to strangle the Cuban revolution.
    The telegram said: The Cuban people's anti-American patriotic struggle has set a glorious example for the Latin American people. We firmly believe that with the support of the powerful socialist camp, the support of the Latin American people, and the support of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, the heroic Cuban people, united and persistent in their struggle, will surely continue to defeat the US imperialist aggressive conspiracy and win new and greater victories.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: The All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram on the 24th to the Federation of University Students for Independence of Puerto Rico, supporting the struggle of the people and young students of Puerto Rico against US imperialist colonial rule and for national independence.
    The telegram said: "Since US imperialism forcibly occupied Puerto Rico sixty-two years ago and carried out barbaric rule and cruel plunder of Puerto Rico, the heroic Puerto Rican people and young students have waged successive struggles against US imperialist colonial rule and for national independence. Especially in recent years, inspired by the high tide of the national democratic movement of the heroic Cuba and the entire Latin American people, the anti-American demonstration movements held by the Puerto Rican people and young students to demand independence have risen wave after wave. The heroic struggle of the Puerto Rican people once again shows that US imperialism, which has done all kinds of bad things, is everywhere arousing the awakening and resistance of the oppressed people."
    The telegram said: "The current situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggles of the people of all countries. US imperialism has become a rat crossing the street, chased and beaten by everyone, and its lifespan will not be very long. What US imperialism fears most is the awakening and unity of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. We firmly believe that as long as the Puerto Rican people and young students strengthen unity, constantly expose the US imperialist conspiracy of deception and suppression, and persist in the struggle, they will surely overthrow US colonial rule and win the freedom and independence of the Puerto Rican people."

    电报说：“自从美帝国主义在六十二年以前以武力占领了波多黎各并对波多黎各进行了野蛮统治和残酷掠夺以来，英勇的波多黎各人民和青年学生为了反对美帝国主义殖民统治和争取民族独立进行了前仆后继的斗争。特别是近年来，波多黎各人民和青年学生，在英雄的古巴和全拉丁美洲人民民族民主运动高涨形势的鼓舞下，为了要求独立而举行的反美示威运动，一浪高过一浪。波多黎各人民的英勇斗争，再一次表示了，做尽了坏事的美帝国主义，正到处激起被压迫人民的觉醒和反抗。”
