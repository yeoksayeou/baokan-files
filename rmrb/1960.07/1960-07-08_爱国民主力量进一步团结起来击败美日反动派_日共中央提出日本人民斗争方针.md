Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published on the 6th the communique issued by the 11th Central Committee Plenary Meeting of the Japanese Communist Party held from June 29th to July 1st.

The communique stated: The Central Committee Plenary Meeting, after listening to and discussing the report made by the cadre meeting on the development of the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the work of building the party in the current people's struggle, approved this report.

The communique said, "The Central Committee Plenary Meeting passed a call entitled 'Let Us Unite and Advance Under the Banner of Patriotism and Justice.'"

"The plenary meeting also passed a resolution opposing the (Kishi Nobusuke) government's attempt to suppress democratic forces, condemning this attempt as illegal and brutal."

The communique said, "The plenary meeting agreed that the party's strength should be concentrated at one time on the struggle against the 'Security Treaty' and the upcoming election campaign." Therefore, the plenary meeting decided to postpone the party congress originally scheduled for mid-October this year to a date as early as possible after the election.

The communique said that the plenary meeting adopted policy guidelines for the upcoming general election and decided to launch a campaign to raise 100 million yen for the election.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: "Akahata" published on the 6th a call entitled "Let Us Unite and Advance Under the Banner of Patriotism and Justice" passed by the 11th Central Committee Plenary Meeting of the Japanese Communist Party.

The call stated: "The Japanese Communist Party calls on all people concerned about the crisis of the nation and democracy to take their actions according to the following guidelines:

First, the joint struggle organizations established to oppose the revision of the 'Security Treaty' should be strengthened and developed into permanent organizations as the basis of a united front.

Second, the people should strengthen their struggle against the suppressive measures that the government has taken and will take, unite all forces against Nobusuke Kishi to successfully establish a caretaker government, and dissolve the Diet under the impetus of the people.

Third, in the upcoming general election, all democratic and patriotic forces should unite to successfully expel from the political arena all the traitorous politicians who played a major role in the forced passage of the new Security Treaty."

The call stated: "The Communist Party advocates the establishment of a democratic united front government through general elections and the actions of the masses. The core of this government should be the political forces that oppose the Security Treaty. This government should also represent all forces that are sworn to defend democracy and the Constitution, and all forces that agree to improve Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-Soviet relations. If such a government is established, it will help to strengthen the unity of the people and create favorable conditions for the people's forces to achieve further victories."

The call pointed out: "The Japanese Socialist Party advocates the establishment of a 'government that adheres to the Constitution, democracy, and neutrality.' The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan demands the establishment of a 'government that refuses to recognize the new Security Treaty and adheres to the Constitution, democracy, and neutrality.' These proposals are correct proposals and are consistent with our proposals on many issues."

The call pointed out: "What is of the greatest significance now is to unite all political forces that agree with democracy and are committed to the patriotic cause around these progressive proposals. There is no reason to suggest that all the democratic forces that have united in the anti-Security Treaty movement so far cannot maintain their unity in the future."

The call pointed out: "In the course of the 18-month-long struggle against the 'Security Treaty,' the Japanese people have successfully formed a broad united front and are deeply convinced that they have the power to change the country's policies in the direction the people desire. This situation has opened up new prospects for further struggles for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality. This is the greatest victory in the history of the Japanese people's democratic movement."

The call stated: "The US imperialists and Japanese reactionaries are shocked by the increasingly surging tide of the people's movement. They are determined to create divisions among the people participating in the anti-'Security Treaty' movement in order to destroy the achievements made by the people."

The call pointed out: At present, the Japanese people are at a crucial juncture. They must choose between continuing to move forward and preserving their achievements, or being hindered from continuing to advance their cause and succumbing to the pressure of the US imperialists and the traitorous Japanese reactionaries.

"If they unite, repulse the reactionaries' suppression and divisive attacks, and show greater courage to continue the struggle, they will surely isolate the enemy and advance along the road to victory. If they forget the achievements they have made and allow their unity to slacken, Japan will be led onto the path of fascism and reaction."

The call concluded: "Let us move forward, holding high our banner of patriotism and justice, under this banner uniting all the people, opposing the US imperialists and the traitorous reactionaries of Japan, and defending the achievements that the people have made."

    爱国民主力量进一步团结起来击败美日反动派
    日共中央提出日本人民斗争方针
    （一）加强为反对日美条约而成立的共同斗争组织，作为统一战线的基础；（二）反对政府镇压措施，团结反岸力量建立看守政府，解散国会；（三）通过大选从政界驱逐卖国政客，建立民主统一战线政府
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”6日刊载了在6月29日至7月1日举行的日本共产党第十一次中央委员会全体会议发表的公报。
    公报说：中央委员会全体会议在听取和讨论了干部会所作的关于日本人民反对日美“安全条约”斗争的发展情况以及在目前人民的斗争中开展建党工作的报告之后，批准了这个报告。
    公报说，“中央委员会全体会议通过了题为‘让我们团结起来，在爱国主义和正义的旗帜下前进’的呼吁书。”
      “全体会议还通过了反对（岸信介）政府镇压民主力量的图谋的决议，谴责这种图谋是非法的和残暴的。”
    公报说，“全体会议同意，党的力量在一个时候应当集中于反对
  ‘安全条约’的斗争和即将到来的竞选运动。”因此，全体会议决定把原定在今年10月中举行的党代表大会延期到选举以后尽可能早的日期召开。
    公报说，全体会议通过了对即将举行的大选的政策方针，并决定展开一个筹集一亿日元以进行选举的运动。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”6日发表了日本共产党第十一次中央委员会全体会议通过的题为“让我们团结起来，在爱国主义和正义的旗帜下前进”的呼吁书。
    呼吁书说：“日本共产党呼吁关心民族和民主的危机的全体人民根据以下的方针采取他们的行动：
    第一、应当加强为反对修改
  ‘安全条约’而成立的共同斗争组织，并把它们发展为永久性组织，以作为统一战线的基础。
    第二、人民应当加强他们反对政府已经采取的和将要采取的镇压措施的斗争，团结一切反对岸信介的力量胜利地建立看守政府，使国会在人民的推动下解散。
    第三、在即将举行的大选中，一切民主和爱国力量应该团结起来，从而胜利地从政界中驱逐那些在强行通过新安全条约中起了主要作用的所有卖国政客。”
    呼吁书说：“共产党主张通过大选和人民群众的行动来建立民主统一战线的政府。这一政府的核心应当是反对安全条约的政治力量。这一政府还应当代表誓将保卫民主和宪法的一切力量，代表赞同改善日中和日苏关系的一切力量。如果建立这样的政府，它将有助于加强人民团结和为人民力量取得进一步的胜利创造有利的条件。”
    呼吁书指出：“日本社会党主张建立‘恪守宪法的民主和中立政府’。日本工会总评议会要求建立
  ‘拒绝承认新安全条约和恪守宪法的民主和中立政府。’这些建议是正确的建议，在许多问题上同我们的建议是一致的。”
    呼吁书指出：“现在具有最重大意义的是把一切赞同民主和致力于爱国事业的一切政治力量团结在这些进步建议的周围。没有理由表明，到目前为止在反对安全条约运动中团结起来的一切民主力量为什么将来不能保持他们的团结。”
    呼吁书指出：“日本人民在持续十八个月的反对‘安全条约’的斗争过程中，已经顺利地形成了广泛的统一战线，并且深信自己有力量改变国家的政策，使之朝着人民企望的方向前进。这种情况为进一步争取和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争展开了新的前景。这是在日本人民民主运动的历史上所取得的最伟大的胜利。”
    呼吁书说：“美帝国主义者和日本反动派对日益汹涌澎湃的人民运动的浪潮感到震惊，他们坚决要在参加反对‘安全条约’运动的人民中间制造分裂，以摧毁人民所取得的成果。”
    呼吁书指出：目前，日本人民正处在决定性的关头。他们必须在两者之间作出抉择——要末继续前进，保住自己的成果，要末受到阻挠，不能继续向自己的事业前进，屈服于美帝国主义者和卖国的日本反动派的压力。
    “如果他们团结起来，击退反动派的镇压和分裂的进攻，拿出更大的勇气来继续斗争下去，那么必将使敌人孤立，并且沿着胜利的道路前进。如果他们忘记了自己已经取得的成果，让自己的团结松弛下来，那么日本将被引上法西斯主义和反动的道路。”
    呼吁书最后写道：“让我们向前进、高举我们的爱国主义和正义的旗帜，在这个旗帜下团结全体人民，反对美帝国主义者和日本的卖国反动派，保卫人民已经取得的成就。”
