    According to the Shanxi Daily: After widespread welcome rain in various parts of Shanxi Province, a rapid upsurge in crash planting and replanting is sweeping across the province.
    After the welcome rain in the Jin southeast region, the people of the entire region enthusiastically responded to the call of the local Party committee, throwing eight hundred thousand people into the "five抢 (qiang - to seize)" battle of crash replanting, crash intercropping, crash planting vegetables, crash water storage, and crash irrigation. According to incomplete statistics from the 2nd and 3rd, the entire region replanted and intercropped more than 450,000 mu, planted 140,000 mu of vegetables, stored more than 20 million cubic meters of water, and blocked flood irrigation for more than 347,000 mu. At the same time as the rainfall, the CPC Lingchuan County Committee convened an emergency telephone conference for the heads of various communes, factories, mines, organs, and schools. After the meeting, a crash campaign was immediately launched. In just two days, the county rushed to plant more than 10,000 mu of various vegetables. At the same time, 20,000 dry wells, 500 drying pools, and 25 reservoirs were filled with water. Yangcheng County organized 120,000 people to plant 28,000 mu of vegetables and small autumn crops in mountain gullies, ridges, slopes, river banks, canal embankments, roadsides, field edges, and village edges.
    On July 4th, ten counties in the Jin south region, including Lüliang, Shilou, Anze, and Yicheng, experienced rainfall of 30 to 50 millimeters. Various localities immediately strengthened the planting teams. By the 6th, the entire region had rapidly planted 260,000 mu after the rain. In addition, 40,000 mu of small plots were planted, more than 100,000 mu of large autumn crops were replanted where seedlings were missing, and 1.5 million mu were harrowed to conserve soil moisture.
    Since July 2nd, in the Jinzhong region, except for Linxian, Lishi, and Zhongyang counties along the Yellow River, where rainfall was about 10 millimeters, the remaining fourteen counties and cities have received rainfall of 20 to 90 millimeters. Local Party committees at all levels immediately organized large numbers of cadres to go deep into the front lines of the fields to lead the rush planting and irrigation. Taigu County greatly increased its enthusiasm for expanding the area for replanting after the rain, increasing the replanting plan from 150,000 mu to 250,000 mu. The daily progress of irrigation in Yuci City increased from 1,200 mu to 20,000 mu. In order to achieve the greatest results in the shortest time, Fenyang County organized 25,000 laborers and 2,200 draft animals to rush to plant, sowing more than 10,000 mu after the rain and replanting more than 20,000 mu.
    In the Jinbei region, except for Xingxian, Baode, Wutai, and six other counties with less rainfall, the remaining fourteen counties received rainfall of 15 to 40 millimeters. In order to plant all available vacant land, all rural commune members, organ cadres, school teachers and students, and factory and mine workers were thrown into the battle, and tasks of crash planting grain, vegetables, and grass were assigned by land and by person. At the same time, all walks of life in the region, and rural commune members, seized every opportunity to plant grain, vegetables, and grass in front of and behind houses, along highways, railways, canals, and on land not occupied by basic construction. After a half-day crash campaign, Xinding, Yanggao, and four other counties had planted 96,000 mu of miscellaneous small grains, more than 80,000 mu of vegetables, and checked and replanted 560,000 mu.

    According to the Dazhong Daily: Shandong Province has had widespread rainfall in recent days, and people in various localities are seizing this opportunity to vigorously rush to plant and replant; in areas with heavier rainfall, the masses are rising up to fight floods and rush to plant.
    The Heze region, which had been severely drought-stricken, received heavy rain from June 27 to July 1. Party organizations at all levels immediately organized all forces that could be organized, setting off a post-rain rush planting upsurge. Juancheng County dispatched 220,000 laborers, 12,600 strong cattle and horses, and 2,145 seed drills. Under the leadership of 9,800 county, commune, and team cadres, they rushed to plant soybeans, corn, mung beans, and sweet potatoes 99,900 mu in one day and night in the rain. Under the slogan of seizing time to grasp the key and not leaving an inch of land idle in 10,000 mu, and not missing a single seedling in 1,000 mu, 152,000 laborers in Pingyin County rushed to plant 71,640 mu of various crops in one day on June 30. 200,000 laborers in Shanxian County, day and night, regardless of wind and rain, fought fiercely for a day and a half, rushing to plant 128,761 mu of soybeans and transplanting more than 11,000 mu of sweet potatoes.

In addition to planting soybeans after the rain, Juye County also rushed to plant 70,000 mu of small miscellaneous grains and simultaneously carried out crash seedling inspection and replanting of 190,000 mu.
    After the rainfall on June 27, the CPC Jining Prefectural Committee promptly issued an emergency notice to various counties and cities, requiring Party committees at all levels to earnestly strengthen leadership and seize the rain to rush to plant. While rushing to plant, inspect and replant seedlings to ensure full and strong seedlings; and make full use of all available vacant land to ensure that no land is left idle. After the prefectural committee's notice was issued, various localities held meetings overnight, organizing manpower and materials to rush to plant in the rain.

After the rain, Zou County dispatched 100,000 laborers to rush to transplant more than 38,600 mu of sweet potatoes and sow more than 35,000 mu of soybeans in the rain. In the crash planting campaign, Party committee secretaries at all levels took responsibility for designated areas, led cadres deep into the front lines of production, participated in the rush planting, and led the rush planting. Comrade Wang Deguang, the first secretary of the Jinxiang County Party Committee, led 1,750 cadres and students to rush to plant with the commune members of the Jin No. 1 Production Team of Chengguan Commune, transplanting 250 mu of sweet potatoes and 150 mu of rice in one afternoon. Currently, more than 1.6 million troops in the region are engaged in rush planting, and the daily sowing progress has increased from more than 130,000 mu before the rain to 300,000 mu.
    Due to the heavy rainfall in Wulian, Yishui, and Qingdao City, a flood prevention struggle has been launched while rushing to plant. They are determined to achieve a bumper harvest in both flood prevention and rush planting.

    According to the Hebei Daily: Since July 5, many areas of Hebei Province have experienced widespread welcome rain, and the masses in these areas are rushing to plant, replant, and protect seedlings in the rain.
    Since July 5, Tianjin City has experienced rainfall in all counties except for some communes in Huanghua and other counties. The counties and communes that have already received rainfall have seized this favorable opportunity to crash plant late autumn crops. Many counties convened emergency telephone conferences during the rainfall to deploy the rush planting battle. In order to ensure the quality of the rush planting and speed up the rush planting, cadres at all levels in Hejian County assumed overall responsibility, leading the masses to crash plant. The three-level secretaries of Jinghai County led more than 90,000 troops in rush planting and seedling replanting, launching the rush planting and seedling replanting battle on the night of the rainfall. Tangguantun Commune transplanted more than 3,000 mu of rice seedlings and replanted more than 4,000 seedlings in just two days. In order to fight this battle well, six county party committee secretaries and twelve members, and more than seventy commune party committee secretaries commanded the rush planting in the rain in Cangxian County, and also transferred more than seven hundred cadres from county-level organs to participate in the rush planting. The daily rush planting progress in the county increased sharply from 10,000 mu to 68,000 mu. By July 6, the entire region had completed sowing more than 9.5 million mu.
    The 500,000 labor force in Tangshan City is seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain, racing against time, and striving for a complete victory in summer planting. According to the instructions of the municipal party committee, all localities immediately took emergency measures.
    Fengrun County transferred 260 cadres to go deep into the front line, organizing the vast number of commune members to crash plant. Hancheng Commune dispatched 20,000 people on the same day, planting nearly 10,000 mu in half a day. The Yutian County Party Committee organized more than 130,000 laborers to participate in the crash planting campaign.
