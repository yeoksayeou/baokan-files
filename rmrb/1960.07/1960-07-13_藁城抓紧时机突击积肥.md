This newspaper reports: Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, has launched a summer high tide of manure accumulation. As of now, the county has accumulated 2.2 billion catties of coarse manure.

Gaocheng County, while fighting drought, analyzed the situation and calculated the needs, determining that they still lacked 2 billion catties of coarse manure based on their production increase plan. Based on the favorable conditions of abundant green grass, miscellaneous fertilizer, high temperature, and rapid fermentation in summer, the county committee issued a call to the people of the county to "seize the opportunity, launch a crash program of manure accumulation, and ensure a bumper harvest in autumn." This call quickly turned into practical action by the masses, immediately setting off a high tide of manure accumulation throughout the county. All 2,580 pig farms in the county determined manure accumulation tasks, implementing targets down to each pen and assigning responsibilities to individuals. The Nandong Commune adopted a daily one-hour manure accumulation system, proposing the slogan "Two baskets of soil at noon, two loads of water in the evening, a basket of manure to the fields, and a basket of grass back to the village." Secretaries at all levels took the lead in going to the fields to carry manure and cut grass to accumulate fertilizer, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the commune members, who cut 120,000 catties of grass and transported 600,000 catties of manure in two days. The Zengcun Commune mobilized 2,000 laborers to dig, find, sweep, dismantle, and scoop, accumulating more than 4 million catties of house soil, pit mud, chicken manure, and other fertilizers, and cutting 300,000 catties of green grass in two days.
