Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 19th: Henan Province is concentrating its efforts to wage a great battle in July, August, and September, launching a production campaign centered on strengthening the management of autumn fields to seize a bumper autumn harvest.

As of the 17th, the province had completed over 98% of its summer sowing plan, with the exception of a few areas still rushing to plant sweet potatoes. More than 40 million mu were sown under drought-resistant conditions. Luoyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang prefectures, as well as Zhengzhou city, all exceeded their summer sowing targets. This year's summer sowing was not only timely despite the drought, but also done well and extensively. According to statistics from Nanyang, Xuchang, Luoyang, and Xinxiang prefectures alone, the sown area has expanded by more than 5 million mu compared to the original plan. Various localities are also vigorously promoting intercropping and mixed cropping to increase yield per unit area. In Kaifeng prefecture, 70% of summer-sown crops have been promoted with mixed intercropping.

Spring-sown crops, after careful management and drought-resistant irrigation, are also growing very vigorously. Early corn has flowered and tasseled, cotton plants one or two feet high are covered with autumn bolls, and early tobacco has been harvested and cured. The vast countryside presents a delightful scene.

In order to manage spring-sown and summer-sown crops well and strive for a triple bumper harvest of autumn grain, industrial raw material crops, and vegetables, the Provincial Party Committee called on the vast masses of the province to carry out a "six-no" movement: no idle land wasted, no missing seedlings or broken ridges, no weeds, no pests and diseases, no waterlogging or drought disasters, and no third-class seedlings. After the Provincial Party Committee issued this call, the broad masses of the province were in high spirits. Under the slogan "Do not dismount from the summer harvest horse, but raise the autumn leap forward whip again," they quickly shifted to autumn field management after basically completing the summer sowing task. At present, more than 8.7 million laborers throughout the province have been mobilized for autumn field management, and various localities are continuing to concentrate labor to strengthen this front. After promoting the "two-five system" of leadership, the work style of the broad masses of cadres has become more down-to-earth, and they have gone deep into the front line of production to participate in and lead production. Recently, various localities in the province have continued to organize more cadres to go to the countryside to participate in autumn field management. Yang Weiping, Song Zhihe, Li Li, and Wu Hao, secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, as well as Liu Mingbang, Dai Suli, members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, and responsible comrades from various departments, have led groups of cadres to various localities to strengthen leadership over agricultural production and the support of all industries for agriculture. Xinxiang prefecture recently transferred another 70,000 cadres to participate in autumn field management. In Nanyang prefecture, Neixiang, Xixia, and other four counties, in addition to the cadres who went down during the drought resistance and rush planting, more than 1,400 people were drawn from county-level directly affiliated organs to go to areas with serious weed infestation and carry out a concentrated attack on field management together with the masses.

The autumn field management work in various localities is being carried out both vigorously and solidly. Since July, August, and September are the decisive moments for striving for an autumn harvest, all localities are seizing the time by grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping fiercely, and vigorously grasping a series of tasks such as checking seedlings and replanting, deep plowing to eradicate stubble, loosening soil to conserve moisture, applying topdressing fertilizer universally, preventing and controlling pests and diseases, and preventing drought and flood. According to preliminary statistics, 91% of the summer-sown fields with missing seedlings in the province have been replanted. Most of the spring-sown and summer-sown crops have been hoed once and topdressed once. High-yield plots and cotton fields have been hoed two or three times. Most of the 3 million mu of cotton fields with bollworms and grasshoppers have been treated once or twice in a timely manner, and the pests have been basically eradicated. Due to the drought in the previous stage, the soil was hardened, and weeds sprouted after the rain, so various localities have highlighted the importance of deep plowing to eradicate stubble. Various localities are also vigorously grasping fertilizer, producing large quantities of local fertilizer, and continuing to prepare topdressing fertilizer for autumn crops.

Because the field management work is meticulous and solid, the vast masses of the people have increased their confidence in seizing an autumn harvest. Various localities are creating conditions by adapting to local conditions and striving for an autumn harvest in every possible way, taking both high-yield plots and expanding the summer sowing area, using the "ten sides" and "ten borders" to vigorously carry out a super-production movement. High-yield plots account for about 40% of summer-sown crops in the province. Many areas are planning high-yield plots with higher standards, carrying out basic farmland construction in high-yield plots, and achieving double insurance of wells and canals to ensure a bumper harvest regardless of drought or flood.

From June 25th to now, there has been sufficient rainfall in various parts of Henan Province. However, under the guidance of the idea of long-term drought resistance, striving for an autumn harvest regardless of drought or flood, the vast areas of the province are still carrying out basic water conservancy construction and water storage and conservation campaigns. In order to implement water conservancy construction throughout the year without affecting the current autumn field management movement, many areas have organized permanent water conservancy professional teams. In areas with more rainfall and abundant water sources, they are grasping flood prevention on the one hand and water storage and conservation on the other.

    抓紧农业生产黄金季节  大战七、八、九月
    河南集中劳力加强秋田管理
    新华社郑州19日电  河南省集中力量大战7、8、9三个月，开展了以加强秋田管理为中心的夺取秋季丰收的生产运动。
    全省截至17日止，除少数地区仍在抢种红薯以外，全省夏播计划已完成98％以上，其中有四千多万亩都是抗旱播种的。洛阳、许昌、南阳三个专区及郑州市都超额完成了夏播任务。今年夏播不仅在干旱的情况下做到了适时播种，而且种的好、种的多。仅据南阳、许昌、洛阳、新乡四个专区的统计，已播面积就比原计划扩大五百多万亩。各地还大搞套作、间作，提高单位面积产量。开封专区70％的夏播作物，都推广了混播套作。
    春播作物经过精心管理和抗旱浇水，也长得非常茁壮，早玉米已扬花吐穗，一两尺高的棉株已挂满伏桃，早烟都已收烤。广大农村一片喜人景象。
    为了把春播、夏播作物管好，力争秋季粮食、工业原料作物、蔬菜三丰收，省委号召全省广大群众开展一个无废闲地、无缺苗断垅、无杂草、无病虫害、无水旱灾害、无三类苗的“六无”运动。省委这一号召发出后，全省广大群众斗志昂扬，在“不下夏季丰收马，又扬秋季跃进鞭”的口号下，在基本结束夏种任务以后，又迅速转向秋田管理。目前全省调集到秋田管理上来的劳力已有八百七十多万人，各地还在继续集中劳力，加强这条战线。广大干部在推广“二五制”的领导方法以后，作风也比以前更踏实，纷纷深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。最近，全省各地又继续组织更多的干部下乡参加秋田管理。省委书记处书记杨蔚屏、宋致和、李立、吴皓，省委常委刘名榜、戴苏理等和各部门的负责同志，都率领一批干部分赴各地，加强对农业生产和各行各业支援农业的领导。新乡专区最近又抽调了七万名干部参加秋田管理。南阳专区内乡、西峡等四个县，除抗旱抢种时下去的干部原地不动外，又从县直属机关中抽出一千四百多人，下到草荒严重的地区，和群众一起突击田间管理。
    各地秋田管理工作做得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。由于7、8、9三个月是争取秋季丰收的决定性时刻，各地都以抓早、抓紧、抓狠、抢时间，大抓查苗补苗、深锄灭茬、松土保墒、普施追肥、防治病虫害、防旱防汛等一系列工作。据初步统计，全省缺苗的夏播田已有91％补种。春播、夏播作物绝大部分都已锄过一遍，施过一次追肥，丰产方和棉花已锄过两三遍，发生棉铃虫和土蝗的三百万亩棉田，大部分都及时治过一两遍，虫害已基本扑灭。由于前一阶段天旱，土地板结，雨后杂草萌生，所以各地都突出抓住深锄灭茬。各地还大抓肥料，大量制造土化肥，继续为秋收作物准备追肥。
    由于田间管理工作做得细致、踏实，广大群众对夺取秋季丰收的信心倍增。各地因地制宜，千方百计创造条件争取秋季丰收，采取一手抓丰产方，一手抓扩大夏播面积，利用“十旁”和“十边”，大搞超产运动。全省夏播作物丰产方约占40％ 左右。许多地区都以更高的标准来规划丰产方，在丰产方内大搞农田基本建设，实现井渠双保险，旱涝保丰收。
    从6月25日到现在，河南省各地雨水充足，但是在树立长期抗旱的思想指导下，力争秋季旱、涝保丰收，全省广大地区的水利基本建设和蓄水保水运动仍在进行着。为了使水利建设贯彻全年，又不影响当前秋田管理运动，很多地区都组织常年水利专业队，在落雨较多，水源充足的地区，正一手抓紧防汛，一手抓蓄水保水。
