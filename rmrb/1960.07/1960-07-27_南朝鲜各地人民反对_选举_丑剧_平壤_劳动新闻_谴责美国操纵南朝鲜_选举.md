Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th -- Seoul News: On the eve of the South Korean traitorous politicians preparing to stage a pseudo "National Assembly Election" farce on July 29th, students, citizens, and women in various parts of South Korea have risen up to oppose Syngman Rhee's cronies and corrupt officials from serving as "candidates."

Students and citizens in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, have been tenaciously engaged in a struggle for days to oppose Oh Jae-young, a Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party follower, from serving as a "National Assembly" "candidate" in Anseong. On the 25th, 120 students from Anbeop Middle School in Anseong went to Seoul and held a sit-in demonstration in front of the main entrance of the Central Government Building, the location of the puppet government, to oppose the Heo Jeong group and the pseudo "Central Election Commission" from protecting Oh Jae-young, allowing him to continue as a "candidate," when he had to express his abandonment of the "election" due to popular opposition. On this day, two student representatives rushed into Heo Jeong's office to negotiate with Heo Jeong. Because Heo Jeong refused them, the students submitted a letter of protest to Heo Jeong's secretary.

According to reports, these students, carrying placards and walking from Anseong to Seoul, held sit-in struggles in front of the pseudo "Central Election Commission" on the 24th and 25th.

According to Donghwa News Agency, on the evening of the 24th, more than 3,000 students and residents in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, held a demonstration to oppose Choi Seok-rim, a Syngman Rhee's follower, from serving as a "National Assembly" "candidate" there. In addition, at around 8 p.m. that night, more than 120 students holding a hunger strike in front of Choi Seok-rim's election office held a demonstration, holding up placards with the words "Counter-revolutionary forces get out!" Then, more than 3,000 citizens joined them and held a rally denouncing Choi Seok-rim. The students and citizens also sent people to Choi Seok-rim's home that night to arrest him. When he fled, the students continued to hold a sit-in demonstration in front of his election office and warned Choi Seok-rim that if he did not announce his abandonment of being a "candidate," they would destroy his residence. According to Busan Radio, more than 1,000 women and citizens in Jeonju also held a demonstration on the 19th to oppose corrupt officials from running for "National Assembly" members there.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Pyongyang's "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 23rd, condemning the U.S. imperialists for stepping up their manipulation of the South Korean 5th "National Assembly" "election."

The commentary said that according to South Korea's Dongyang News Agency, the U.S. Embassy in South Korea has organized eight "election observation groups" to be sent to various parts of South Korea from July 25th to "observe the election." The commentary pointed out that this is such a shameless act. No one in the Korean people has entrusted the U.S. Embassy with such a "mission," nor has it given it such authority. In particular, the action of a foreign embassy "observing" the election in its host country is unprecedented in the history of diplomacy. This is another open interference by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in South Korea's internal affairs and an intolerable insult to the South Korean people.

The commentary said that in the past, under the name of "supervising elections," the U.S. imperialists created a so-called "United Nations Korean Unification and Reconstruction Commission" as a tool to make the traitor Syngman Rhee "elected" as "President" and created a puppet "National Assembly." In this South Korean "election," in addition to once again trotting out the "United Nations Korean Unification and Reconstruction Commission" as a tool and greatly increasing the number of people in this "commission," the U.S. imperialists also intend to directly interfere in the "election" through "observation" in an attempt to have their puppets seize power.

    南朝鲜各地人民反对“选举”丑剧
    平壤“劳动新闻”谴责美国操纵南朝鲜“选举”
    新华社平壤26日电　汉城消息：在南朝鲜卖国政客准备在7月29日上演伪“国会议员选举”丑剧的前夕，南朝鲜各地学生、市民、妇女纷纷起来反对李承晚的党羽和贪污犯充当“候选人”。
    南朝鲜京畿道安城的学生和市民连日来顽强地展开反对李承晚的自由党党徒吴在泳在安城充当“民议员”“候选人”的斗争。25日，安城的安法中学学生一百二十人来到汉城，在傀儡政府所在地——中央厅正门前面举行静坐示威，反对许政集团和伪“中央选举委员会”在吴在泳由于人民的反对不得不表示放弃“竞选”的时候，又庇护他，让他继续充当“候选人”的措施。这一天，有两名学生代表冲进了许政的办公室，要同许政进行谈判。由于许政拒绝了他们，学生们向许政的秘书提出了抗议书。
    据报道，举着标语牌由安城徒步走到汉城的这些学生24日和25日在伪“中央选举委员会”前面进行了静坐斗争。
    据同和通讯社报道，24日晚间，庆尚南道的固城有三千多学生和居民举行示威，反对李承晚的党羽崔奭林在这里充当“民议员”“候选人”。另外，这一天晚上八时左右，在崔奭林的选举事务所前面举行绝食斗争的一百二十多名学生，高举着写有“反革命势力滚开！”的标语牌举行了示威。接着，有三千多市民同他们汇合在一起，举行了声讨崔奭林大会。学生和市民们当天晚上并且派人到崔奭林的家中去捉他。当他逃跑了以后，学生们继续在他的选举事务所前面举行静坐示威，并警告崔奭林，如果他不宣布放弃充当“候选人”，就将捣毁他的住宅。据釜山广播电台广播，全州市的一千多名妇女和市民19日也举行示威，反对贪污犯在那里竞选“民议员”。
    据新华社平壤讯　平壤“劳动新闻”23日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义加紧操纵南朝鲜的第五届“国会”“选举”。
    评论说，据南朝鲜东洋通讯社报道，美国驻南朝鲜大使馆已经组织了八个“选举视察团”，准备从7月25日起派往南朝鲜各地“视察选举”。评论指出，这是多么无耻的勾当，朝鲜人民谁也没有委任给美国大使馆这样的“使命”，也没有给它这样的权限。特别是，外国大使馆“视察”驻在国的选举这样的行动是外交史上所未曾有过的。这是美帝国主义侵略者对南朝鲜内政的又一次公开干涉，是对南朝鲜人民的不可容忍的侮辱。
    评论说，过去美帝国主义在“监督选举”的名义下，曾经制造了一个所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”作为工具，使卖国贼李承晚“当选”了“大总统”，并且制造了傀儡“国会”。美帝国主义在这次南朝鲜“选举”中，除了再次搬出“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”这一工具，并使这个“委员会”的人数大大增加以外，还要通过“视察”来直接干涉“选举”，企图使它的傀儡掌握政权。
