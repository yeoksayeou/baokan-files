Xinhua News Agency, July 6th dispatch from Tunis: Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, delivered a radio address to the Algerian people in Tunis on the 5th, stating that the conditions for negotiation proposed by the French government are "so narrow, restrictive, and humiliating that all free negotiation is currently an illusion." He said, "The war may still be long. While seeking negotiations and giving peace every opportunity, we must strengthen our means of fighting and our armed struggle. Independence is not to be had for the asking; it must be won."

Abbas said that when the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria decided to send a delegation to Paris on June 20th, it was fully aware of the enormous differences between it and the French government.

He said that the recent preparatory meetings in Melun, France, between envoys of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and representatives of the French government "showed that these differences are even greater. Not only could the two viewpoints not be reconciled, but our envoys found themselves facing a flat refusal to negotiate. The conditions and methods of the talks should be established through common agreement, which is only logical. The French government, however, does not intend to do so. It is attempting to arbitrarily impose its conditions on us, which is extremely serious."

Abbas said that in the negotiations, the French government, with a colonialist attitude, refused to conduct any discussions on an equal footing.

Abbas said, "Our desire to seek a solution through negotiations has been interpreted by the enemy as a sign of weakness. They are mistaken. It is no longer the time to stifle our people's desire for liberation when the whole of Africa is gaining freedom, when the forces of freedom are becoming stronger throughout the world, and when colonialism is surrendering on all colonies."

He said, "Now we are better informed about the enemy's intentions," "The experience in Melun clearly shows that we should remain even more vigilant than in the past."

Abbas said, "At a time when the colonial army is launching a war of massacres against us, at a time when the enemy is plotting and maintaining an ambiguous attitude in order to confuse world opinion, we must mobilize all our strength and call on all the people to unite."

He said that the just stance of the Algerian people has won the support of the whole world and gained the sympathy of freedom-loving peoples of all countries.

Abbas said, "Today, after one hundred and thirty years of colonial rule and enslavement, we are asking for new sacrifices." He pointed out, "It is through their struggle that the Algerian people have won the recognition of the right to self-determination, and it is through their fighting that the meetings in Melun have been made possible."

Prime Minister Abbas concluded by shouting, "Long live the Republic of Algeria! Long live a free and independent Algeria!"

    阿巴斯总理号召人民动员起来粉碎敌人阴谋
    阿尔及利亚必须加强斗争争取独立
    法国政府的殖民主义态度使谈判在目前成为幻想
    新华社6日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯5日在突尼斯向阿尔及利亚人民发表广播演说指出，法国政府提出的谈判条件是“如此地狭隘、有限制性和令人屈辱，以至一切自由谈判在目前都成为幻想”。他说，“战争可能仍然是长期的。在寻求谈判和给予和平一切机会的同时，我们必须加强我们战斗的手段和我们的武装斗争。独立不是垂手可得的，它必须是赢得的。”
    阿巴斯说，当阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在6月20日决定派遣一个代表团去巴黎时，它是完全知道它同法国政府之间的巨大分歧的。
    他说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府使节最近同法国政府代表在法国默伦举行的预备会议“表明了这些分歧还要大。不仅两种观点不能够接近，而且我们的使节发现他们自己遭到了断然拒绝谈判。会谈的条件和办法应当通过共同的协议来建立，这才是合乎逻辑的。法国政府却不打算这样做。它企图专断地把它的条件强加于我们，这件事是极其严重的。”
    阿巴斯说，在谈判中，法国政府以殖民主义者的态度，拒绝在平等的基础上进行任何讨论。
    阿巴斯说，“我们希望通过谈判求得解决的愿望，却被敌人解释为软弱的表现。他们搞错了。当整个非洲正在获得自由的时候，当自由的力量在全世界变得更加强大的时候，当殖民主义正在所有殖民地上缴械投降的时候，人们要窒息我国人民争取解放的愿望已不是时候了。”
    他说，“现在我们更好地获悉了关于敌人的企图”，“在默伦的经验清楚地表明，我们应当仍然比过去更加警惕”。
    阿巴斯说，“正当殖民军队对我们发动大屠杀的战争的时候，正当敌人阴谋和维持暧昧不明的态度以便迷惑世界舆论的时候，我们必须动员我们一切的力量，并要求所有的人民团结起来。”
    他说，阿尔及利亚人民的正义的立场赢得了全世界的支持并获得了爱好自由的各国人民的同情。
    阿巴斯说，“在受殖民统治和奴役一百三十年以后的今天，我们要求作新的牺牲。”他指出，“阿尔及利亚人民通过他们的斗争才赢得自决权的被承认，通过他们的战斗才得以举行默伦的会谈。”
    阿巴斯总理最后高呼，“阿尔及利亚共和国万岁！自由和独立的阿尔及利亚万岁！”
