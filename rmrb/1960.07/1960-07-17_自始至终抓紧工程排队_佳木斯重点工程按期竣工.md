According to Heilongjiang Daily: The Jiamusi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in leading basic construction work, conscientiously implemented the policy of concentrating forces, ensuring key projects, engaging in large-scale campaigns, and carrying out phased and batch-by-batch assaults. This ensured that key projects took priority, greatly accelerating the progress of basic construction. In the first half of the year, the city's construction and installation workload exceeded the state plan by sixteen days ahead of schedule, an increase of 90% compared to the same period last year.

At the beginning of this year, the Municipal Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, conducted an engineering alignment of the city's basic construction projects. The principle of the alignment was: first the central government, then the local government; first key projects, then general projects; in order to concentrate forces and ensure that key projects take priority and are completed ahead of schedule. The Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, in accordance with the requirements of the Municipal Party Committee, went deep into the grassroots to ascertain the design, material preparation, and other conditions of the construction projects, and proposed specific alignment plans. The method of phased assaults and annihilating battles was adopted. In the first quarter, the focus was on water conservancy projects, with a strong emphasis on the completion of cross-year finishing projects. In the second quarter, the focus was on power generation and steel projects, with a strong emphasis on the finishing projects of water conservancy projects urgently needed for production. Each construction unit formulated monthly plans according to the required completion dates, so that manpower, materials, and machinery and equipment were implemented item by item. As a result, key projects such as water conservancy, power stations, blast furnace改造, and rolling workshops were completed ahead of schedule or on schedule, and twenty-one cross-year ending projects were delivered to production in a timely manner, adding new forces to the production front.

Municipal Party Committee leaders often go deep into the front lines to understand the progress of construction, constantly organize new balances, constantly conduct alignment, and organize annihilating battles, which is an effective measure to ensure key projects. Zhao Yunpeng, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and secretaries Yuan Chao, Li Zhijian, and Deputy Mayor Wang Jiayou and other leading comrades went to the Yuelai Reservoir construction site several times to inspect the progress of the project. When it was discovered that the project was delayed due to the untimely arrival of cement and steel and the lack of underwater construction equipment, they immediately instructed the planning committee to organize relevant units for large-scale collaboration, and transferred, adjusted, and borrowed more than 300 tons of cement, more than 50 tons of steel, and more than 20 types and 50 units (pieces) of winches, motors and other machinery and equipment, ensuring that these more than ten projects were completed on time. In May and June, in concentrating forces to assault the blast furnace改造 and power plant expansion projects, the Municipal Party Committee leaders personally grasped these key projects, convened a meeting of the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee at the site, inspected and deployed the battle plan, and clarified the completion date. During the battle, the Municipal Party Committee found that the equipment, materials, and manpower for the power plant project were insufficient. After requesting instructions from the Prefectural Party Committee and obtaining approval, it immediately decided to postpone the construction of eight projects, including the Prefectural Party Committee office building, the Municipal People's Committee building, and the hotel. More than 130 tons of steel, 200 tons of cement, and some machinery and equipment were transferred from the postponed projects, and 357 technicians were concentrated from various work areas. As a result, the power plant expansion project was completed one month ahead of schedule.

　　自始至终抓紧工程排队
　　佳木斯重点工程按期竣工
    据黑龙江日报消息　中共黑龙江省佳木斯市委在领导基本建设工作中认真贯彻执行集中力量，保证重点，大搞战役，分期分批进行突击的方针，使重点工程优先上马，大大加快了基本建设进度。上半年，全市建筑安装工作量提前十六天超额完成了国家计划，比去年同期增长90％。
    今年年初，市委根据中央和省委的指示精神，对全市基本建设项目进行了工程排队。排队的原则是先中央后地方，先重点后一般，以便集中力量，确保重点工程优先上马，提前建成。市建筑工程管理局根据市委的要求，深入基层，摸清建设项目的设计、备料等情况，提出具体排队计划。采取分批突击，打歼灭战的办法，一季度以水利工程为重点，狠抓跨年度扫尾工程；二季度以发电、钢铁工程为重点，狠抓急需投入生产使用的水利工程扫尾项目。各施工单位按竣工日期的要求，制订月份计划，使人力、材料、机具设备等逐项落实。结果，使水利、电站、高炉改造、轧钢车间等重点工程都提前或按期建成，并有二十一项跨年度结尾工程及时交付生产，为生产战线增加了生力军。
    市委领导同志经常深入第一线，了解施工进展情况，不断组织新的平衡，不断进行排队，组织打歼灭战，是确保重点工程的有效措施。市委第一书记赵云鹏，书记袁超、李志坚、副市长汪家有等领导同志数次到悦来水库建筑工地检查工程进展情况。当发现这项工程由于水泥、钢材到货不及时，缺少水下施工设备以后，立即责成计委组织有关单位大协作，前后抽调、调剂、借用了水泥三百多吨，钢材五十多吨，卷扬机、电动机机具设备二十多种五十多台（件），保证了这十多项按时竣工。5、6月份，在集中力量突击高炉改造和发电厂扩建工程中，市委领导同志亲自抓这几项重点工程，到现场召开市委常委会，检查、部署战役计划，明确竣工日期。在战役进行中，市委发现发电厂工程设备、材料、人力都不足，经请示地委同意，立即决定将正在施工的地委专署办公楼、市人委大楼、宾馆等八项工程缓建，从缓建工程项目中调剂出钢材一百三十多吨，水泥二百吨和部分机具设备，并从各工区集中来三百五十七名技术工人，结果使发电厂扩建工程提前一个月建成。
