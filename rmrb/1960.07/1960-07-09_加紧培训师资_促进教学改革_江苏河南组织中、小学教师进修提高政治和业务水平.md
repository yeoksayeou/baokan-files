Intensify Teacher Training to Promote Teaching Reform
Jiangsu and Henan Organize Primary and Secondary School Teachers for Advanced Studies to Improve Political and Professional Levels

Jiangsu: Teach what you learn, supplement what you lack
Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Jiangsu Province is helping primary and secondary school teachers improve their political and professional levels to meet the needs of teaching reform.

At present, Jiangsu Province's primary and secondary schools are carrying out teaching reform in a vigorous manner. This autumn, a number of pilot primary and secondary schools will begin implementing the new academic system, using new teaching syllabi and textbooks. Non-pilot schools are also actively reforming to improve teaching quality. Faced with this situation, Party committees at all levels regard improving teacher levels as an important link and do everything possible to help teachers pursue advanced studies so that they can quickly adapt to the new teaching needs. At present, all localities have strengthened the leading bodies for teacher training and the tutoring force. Many regions have transferred experienced and outstanding teachers to take on teacher training work. At the same time, according to the requirements of the new teaching syllabus, they comprehensively understand the professional level of in-service teachers and formulate teacher training plans according to the principle of supplementing what is lacking. Many leading cadres of Party committees often go deep into the grassroots to understand the teacher training situation, and many school Party branches take various measures to enable teachers to combine work and rest, ensuring teacher training time.

Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province have adopted many specific methods in organizing teacher training: (1) Organize teachers to participate in the work of compiling new textbooks. More than 4,000 primary and secondary school teachers throughout the province have participated in this work. (2) Teacher training institutions in various places generally run training classes to train teachers. The Nanjing Teacher Training College, in conjunction with new textbooks, has opened eleven study classes in foreign languages, mathematics, and physics, and also uses recorded reports to help primary and secondary school teachers in suburban areas and counties to study. The Xuzhou Teacher Training College has run twelve textbook research classes to organize in-service teachers to study new textbooks and prepare lessons collectively. (3) All graduating students from higher and secondary normal schools throughout the province are given supplementary lessons according to the requirements of the new textbooks, so that they can take on the teaching work of the new academic system as soon as they leave school. (4) Carry out inter-school cooperation, using schools with good teacher resources as bases, to absorb teachers from neighboring schools to participate in advanced studies. For example, the mathematics teaching and research group of Nanjing No. 4 Girls' Middle School takes the capable as teachers and holds three supplementary lecture sessions a week to help teachers master new textbooks. Mathematics teachers from nearby schools actively participate in listening to the lectures. (5) Many schools use methods such as "old leading new," "familiar leading unfamiliar," and "learning while teaching" to organize teacher training. (6) The province has established a broadcasting normal school, opening foreign language classes, Chinese phonetic alphabet classes, and early childhood education classes for primary and secondary schools in the new academic system, and widely organizes primary and secondary school teachers to study.

Now, primary and secondary school teachers in various parts of Jiangsu are enthusiastically participating in various advanced study activities according to their needs, learning what they teach, and supplementing what they lack. Many experienced old teachers have also participated in various spare-time advanced studies, and a new atmosphere of catching up with each other, learning from each other, and helping each other has emerged.

Henan: The province's correspondence and normal education organizations are sound and active

This newspaper dispatch, reporter Chen Jian reports: In order to adapt to the new situation of the current teaching reform, Party committees at all levels in Henan Province are vigorously grasping the training and improvement work of primary and secondary school teachers. A set of correspondence education and normal education organizations that have been formed throughout the province are more sound, active, and colorful. Hundreds of thousands of primary and secondary school teachers have launched a mass learning upsurge.

In leading the work of teaching reform, Party committees and relevant departments at all levels in Henan Province, in order to comprehensively improve teaching quality quickly, well, and economically, first grasped the teacher training work. Many local Party organizations investigated and ranked primary and secondary school teachers in a school, several schools, or a county or district to find out the "professional background" so that they could be improved and trained separately in a planned and step-by-step manner. More than a dozen counties and cities, including Zhengzhou, Linxian, Dengfeng, Luoyang, and Yanshi, conducted investigations and research on more than 3,000 primary and secondary school teachers and formulated practical training plans. Many county-run normal schools and correspondence lecturer groups are led by the head of the county Party committee's cultural and educational department, and a group of middle school teachers are concentrated to strengthen the correspondence and guidance of the lecturer group. The cultural and educational secretaries of the people's communes are now also focusing on the training and improvement of teachers. Party committees at all levels in Henan Province have recently instructed all relevant business departments to leave teachers with the necessary time for study and advanced studies.

The current forms of correspondence education and normal education in Henan Province are diverse. The principle is "learning while teaching" and "supplementing what is lacking." Under the conditions that do not hinder normal teaching, long-term training is combined with short-term crash courses; in-service advanced studies are combined with off-the-job rotation training; individual hard work and drilling, collective discussion, and mutual assistance and mutual learning are combined, and the spirit of "self-reliance, middle (school) leading small (school), old leading new, new and old cooperation, and common improvement" is emphasized. At present, normal schools and lecturer groups at the county level have established correspondence education and normal education organizations. Lecturer groups in more than 40 counties, including Changge, Fugou, Huaxian, Shangqiu, Linxian, Runan, and Yanshi, now regularly use telephone conference calls to conduct teaching courses for middle (junior high) and primary school teachers in the county, and tutors at each guidance point (mostly outstanding teachers from county-run middle schools) provide in-depth and detailed guidance. Changge County has improved its teaching quality and saved manpower due to its good teaching aid reform. Fifty-one higher-level teachers were drawn to concentrate on studying at the county-run normal school. They combined with the county's nine teachers from the lecturer group to form three specialized groups in foreign languages, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and language. They studied on one side and wrote textbooks for middle and primary schools in the county on the other, and were also responsible for the correspondence work of middle and primary school teachers in the county. In addition to planning to transfer a small number of teachers for long-term training, county-run normal schools mainly run short-term crash courses to study foreign languages and mathematics. Shangqiu County has opened four sessions, with a total of more than 600 people.

The correspondence education and normal education of people's communes, plus the thousands of foreign language groups, mathematics, physics, and chemistry groups, and Chinese phonetic alphabet groups spontaneously established by commune-run middle and primary schools, have truly formed a mass learning movement. The people's communes originally had their own correspondence stations and normal schools, and now they have added foreign languages, Chinese phonetic alphabet, and more mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses than in the past. In these communes, in addition to planning to transfer a small number of teachers to county-run normal schools for long-term training, they mainly rely on short-term training courses and various forms of teaching observation meetings, on-site meetings, and regular correspondence lectures. In Huaxian County, the number of primary school teachers and business school teachers currently studying in short-term training classes in people's communes has increased sharply from 600 to more than 6,000. People's communes in Linxian County have opened Sunday advanced study lectures. Many communes recently held correspondence and normal education exhibitions, commending a group of teachers who studied well, and encouraging teachers to actively study. Many middle and primary school teachers in communes have also established their own learning file bags, difficult problem bags, experience collection bags, material cutting bags, and "treasure bags" and "wisdom libraries" to help themselves learn and remember.

In leading this study movement of "teaching must be reformed" and airing out views and debating, Party committees at all levels first stipulated that they must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "On Educational Workers," as well as some documents such as the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The vast number of primary and secondary school teachers have initially used Chairman Mao's ideological weapons to examine various problems in teaching ideology, textbook content, and teaching methods. Many teachers used the spirit of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" to analyze and criticize the main contradictions and phenomena of being divorced from reality in the teaching of their schools. Primary and secondary school teachers in Nanyang and Huaxian counties posted many big-character posters to expose the teaching deficiencies and improve the understanding and confidence of teaching reform. Because politics takes command and ideology leads, Party committees at all levels promptly and vigorously adopted various methods to improve the level of teachers, so that the erroneous thoughts of "not being able to catch up" that once arose in this large-scale teaching innovation were promptly reversed.

    江苏河南组织中、小学教师进修提高政治和业务水平
    江苏：教什么学什么，缺什么补什么
    新华社讯　江苏省帮助中小学教师提高政治、业务水平，适应教学改革的需要。
    目前，江苏省各地中小学正在轰轰烈烈地进行教学改革。今年秋后将有一批试点中小学开始实行新学制，采用新的教学大纲和教材上课。不是试点的学校也在积极改革，提高教学质量。面临这一情况，各地党委都把提高教师水平作为重要环节，千方百计帮助教师进修，使他们能迅速适应新的教学需要。现在各地普遍加强了教师进修的领导机构和辅导力量，许多地区抽调了有经验的优秀教师担任师资培训工作。同时，根据新教学大纲的要求，全面了解在职教师的业务水平，按照缺什么补什么的原则，订出教师进修计划。不少党委负责干部经常深入基层了解教师进修情况，许多学校党支部采取各种措施，使教师作到劳逸结合，保证教师的进修时间。
    江苏省各地党委在组织教师进修中，采取了许多具体办法：（1）组织教师参加编写新教材的工作，全省有四千多中小学教师参加了这个工作。（2）各地教师进修院校普遍开办训练班，培训师资。南京市教师进修学院结合新教材开办了外语、数学、物理等十一个学习班，还用录音报告的方法帮助郊区、县的中小学教师进修。徐州市教师进修学院办了十二个教材研究班，组织在职教师研究新教材，集体备课。（3）全省高等和中等师范院校的应届毕业生全部按照新教材的要求补课，使他们一出校门就能担任新学制的教学工作。（4）开展校际合作，以师资条件好的学校为基地，吸收邻近学校的教师参加进修。如南京市四女中数学教研组以能者为师，每周举办三次补课讲座，帮助教师掌握新教材，附近学校的数学教师都积极参加听课。（5）许多学校用“以老带新”、“以熟带生”、“边学边教”等办法组织教师进修。（6）省设立广播师范学校，开设新学制的中小学外语班，汉语拼音班，幼儿教育班，广泛组织中小学教师学习。
    现在江苏各地的中小学教师，都满怀热情地根据各人需要，教什么学什么，缺什么补什么，积极地参加各种进修活动。很多有经验的老教师也纷纷参加各种业余进修，普遍出现你追我赶，互学互帮的新气象。
    河南：全省函授和师范教育组织健全活跃
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：为了适应当前教学改革的新形势，河南省各级党委大抓中、小学教师的培训提高工作。全省已经形成的一套函授教育和师范教育组织，更加健全活跃和丰富多彩，十几万名中、小学教师，掀起了群众性的学习高潮。
    河南省各级党委和有关部门，在领导教学改革的工作中，为了多快好省地全面提高教学质量，首先抓紧了师资培训工作。许多地区党组织对一个学校、几个学校或一个县、区的中、小学教师进行调查、排队，摸清“业务底子”，以便有计划有步骤的分别进行提高和培训。郑州、林县、登封、洛阳、偃师等十几个县市，在三千多名中、小学教师中进行调查研究，订出了切合实际的培养规划。许多县办的师范学校和函授讲师团，由县委文教部长挂帅领导，并集中一批中学教师加强讲师团的函授和辅导。各人民公社的文教书记，现在也集中抓师资的培训和提高工作。河南省的各级党委最近都指示各有关业务部门，要给教师留出必要的学习和进修时间。
    河南省当前的函授教育和师范教育的形式多种多样，原则是“边学边教”“缺啥补啥”，在不妨碍正常教学的条件下，使长期培训和短期速成结合；在职进修和离职轮训结合；个人苦学苦钻、集体讨论和互助互学结合，并强调“自力更生、以中（学）带小（学）、以老带新、新老协作、共同提高”的精神。目前，县一级的师范学校和讲师团，成立了函授教育和师范教育的组织。长葛、扶沟、滑县、商丘、林县、汝南、偃师等四十多个县的讲师团，现已定期用电话会议的形式，向全县中（初中）、小学教师进行教课，并由各辅导点的辅导员（多半是县办中学的优秀教师），进行深入细致的辅导。长葛县由于教具改革搞的好，提高了教学质量，节约了人力，抽出五十一名水平较高的教员，集中在县办师范学习，他们和县的九名讲师团的教师结合起来，组成外文、数理化、语文等三个专科组，一面学习，一面为全县编写中、小学校的教材，同时又负责全县中、小学教师的函授工作。县办师范学校，除有计划的抽调少数教师长期培养外，主要是开办短期速成班，突击学习外文和数学。商丘县已开办四期，共六百多人。
    各地人民公社的函授教育和师范教育，加上社办中、小学自发成立的成千上万个外文组、数理化组、汉语拼音组等，真正形成了群众性的学习运动。各人民公社原来就有自己的函授站和师范学校，现在都加上外文、汉语拼音和比过去较多的数理化课程。在这些公社里，除有计划的抽调少数教师到县办师范长期培养外，主要依靠短训班和各种形式的教学观摩会、现场会、定期函授讲课等。滑县各人民公社现在正在短训班学习的小学教员和业务学校教师，由过去的六百名激增到六千多，林县各人民公社开设了星期日进修讲座。许多公社最近举办了函授、师范教育展览会，表扬一批学习好的教师，鼓励教师积极学习。许多社办中、小学教员还建立了自己的学习档案袋、疑难问题袋、经验汇集袋、材料剪裁袋及“万宝囊”“集智库”等，帮助自己学习和记忆。
    各地党委在领导这次“教学必须改革”的鸣放辩论的学习运动中，首先规定要认真学习毛主席的“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“正确处理人民内部矛盾”、“论教育工作者”等著作及总路线、大跃进、人民公社等一些文件。广大中小学教师已初步用毛主席的思想武器，检查了教学思想、教材内容、教学方法上的各种问题。许多教师用“矛盾论”、“实践论”的精神，分析批判自己学校教学中的主要矛盾和脱离实际的现象。南阳、滑县的中、小学教师贴出很多大字报揭露教学中的少慢差费，提高了教学改革的认识和信心，由于政治挂帅，思想领先，各级党委及时的大力的采取各种办法，提高师资水平，使广大中、小学教师，在这次大规模的教学革新中，曾一度产生的“赶不上了”等错误思想，及时得到扭转。
