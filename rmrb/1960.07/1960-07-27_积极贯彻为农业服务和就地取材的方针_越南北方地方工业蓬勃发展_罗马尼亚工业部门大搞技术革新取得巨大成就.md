　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd: Since the beginning of this year, local industry in Northern Vietnam has experienced vigorous development. Currently, there are 1003 large and small local industrial enterprises in Northern Vietnam.

　　These industries include more than 30 small iron smelting furnaces, as well as farm tool factories, fertilizer plants, brick and tile factories, agricultural product processing factories, pesticide manufacturing plants, oil pressing plants, indigenous cement manufacturing plants, and small hydroelectric power stations.

　　Local industry in Northern Vietnam began to develop in 1958, the first year of the Three-Year Plan, alongside the development of central industries. Thanks to the active leadership of Party committees at all levels, local industry has made good contributions to supplying the needs of agriculture, basic construction, and people's livelihoods. According to statistics from the beginning of this year, the total output value of local industry is equivalent to 13% of the total output value of central state-owned industry.

　　To ensure the supply of raw materials for local industry, various localities have developed diverse local industries based on the principle of utilizing local materials. Their production is also included in local production plans, ensuring their production and sales.

　　In developing local industry, various localities have actively implemented the policy of serving agriculture. The farm tool factories, fertilizer plants, etc., established in various places are not only welcomed by farmers but have also powerfully supported agricultural production. For example, the farm tool factory established at the Xi Xiao Farm in Thanh Hoa Province supplies water pumps to rural areas, playing a huge role in ensuring farmland irrigation and overcoming drought.

　　Currently, some agricultural cooperatives in Northern Vietnam have also begun to establish local industries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd: The Hanoi Machine Factory and the No. 8 Exploration Team of Taiyuan, in the "Advanced Labor" competition movement, created excellent results, overfulfilling the first half of the year's production plan. They were recently awarded the competition red flags by the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh.

　　The Hanoi Machine Factory is the largest modern factory in Northern Vietnam. This year, the factory's production tasks are greater than the total of the planned targets for 1958 and 1959. At the beginning of this year, it challenged enterprises under the Ministry of Industry, launching a hot labor competition. Over the past six months, the factory's employees have proposed a total of 229 rationalization proposals, increasing the average labor productivity to 125.5%, comprehensively overfulfilling the first half of the year's production plan, with a total output value reaching 119.6% and a commodity output value reaching 103%.

　　This year, the exploration area of the Taiyuan No. 8 Exploration Team is four times larger than in 1959. Facing new combat missions, the Party and Youth League organizations of the exploration team strengthened ideological education for workers, fully promoted the spirit of hard work and fearlessness of difficulties, and vigorously carried out technical innovation and invention, so that labor productivity continued to increase. The labor efficiency of some exploration workers increased by 408%. The team's costs were reduced by 40% compared to last year. The team has completed the first half of the year's production plan forty-eight days ahead of schedule, becoming a red flag on the industrial front.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 24th: According to incomplete statistics from the four departments of Heavy Industry, Petroleum and Chemical Industry, Transportation and Telecommunications, and Consumer Goods Industry, nearly 20,000 innovation and rationalization proposals were adopted in the first half of this year, and it is estimated that more than 300 million lei (Romanian currency) can be saved by the end of the year.

　　This year, more workers are participating in technical innovation. The Ministry of Inorganic Chemical Industry had more than 400 worker innovators in the first half of last year, and more than 500 in the first half of this year. Workers at the Sinaia "Ioan Frimu" machine manufacturing plant put forward the target of "one innovator for every three workers."

　　The central slogan of current technical innovation is to save raw materials, improve equipment utilization, and promote advanced technical operations and technological procedures. The Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory in Stalin City put forward the competition of "producing with saved materials for at least two days per month." Many metallurgical factories in Bucharest, Ploiesti, and Timisoara have participated in this competition.

　　Due to technical innovation, many factories have completed their production tasks for the first half of the year ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan. The "Republic" Rolling Mill in Bucharest completed its production tasks for the first half of the year nineteen days ahead of schedule. The Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine also completed its production tasks for the first half of the year thirteen days ahead of schedule, saving more than 37 million lei.

　　In order to increase production and improve labor productivity more significantly, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers made a resolution on improving the technical level of production in early July. More than 4,000 people at the "Red Flag" Automobile Factory discussed this resolution, and more than 300 of them put forward various innovation proposals. Three thousand nine hundred people at the "Thälmann" Tractor Factory participated in the discussion, putting forward more than 420 innovation proposals.

### 积极贯彻为农业服务和就地取材的方针  越南北方地方工业蓬勃发展  罗马尼亚工业部门大搞技术革新取得巨大成就

    积极贯彻为农业服务和就地取材的方针
    越南北方地方工业蓬勃发展
    罗马尼亚工业部门大搞技术革新取得巨大成就
    新华社河内22日电　越南北方地方工业今年以来有了蓬勃的发展。目前，越南北方已有一千零三个大小地方工业企业。
    这些工业包括三十多座炼铁小高炉，以及农具厂、肥料厂、砖瓦厂、农产品加工厂、农药制造厂、榨油厂、土法水泥制造厂、小型水电站等。
    越南北方地方工业是在三年计划头一年——1958年在发展中央工业的同时开始发展的。由于各级党委的积极领导，地方工业为供应农业、基本建设和人民生活的需要作出了良好的贡献。据今年年初统计，地方工业的总产值相当于中央国营工业总产值的13％。
    为了保证地方工业的原料供应，各地根据就地取材的原则，发展了多种地方工业。它们的生产也都列入了地方生产计划，使得它们的产销都得到保证。
    在发展地方工业中，各地积极贯彻了为农业服务的方针。各地建立的农具厂、肥料厂等，不仅受到农民欢迎，而且有力地支援了农业生产。例如清化省西孝农场建立的农具厂，把它生产的水泵供应农村，对保证农田灌溉、战胜旱灾起了巨大的作用。
    目前，越南北方有些农业合作社也已开始兴办地方工业。
    新华社河内23日电　越南河内机器厂和太原第八勘探队，在“先进劳动”竞赛运动中，创造了优异的成绩，超额完成了上半年生产计划，最近分别荣获了越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席颁发的竞赛流动红旗。
    河内机器厂是越南北方最大的现代化工厂。这个厂今年的生产任务比1958和1959年两年的计划指标的总和还要大。今年年初它向工业部所属企业提出挑战，展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。六个月来，全厂职工共提出了二百二十九项合理化建议，把平均劳动生产率提高到125.5％，全面超额完成了上半年的生产计划，总产值达到119.6％，商品产值达到103％。
    太原第八勘探队今年的勘探面积比1959年扩大四倍。面临着新的战斗任务，勘探队党、团组织加强了对工人的思想教育，充分发扬了艰苦奋斗、不怕困难的精神，并且大搞技术革新和发明创造，使劳动生产率不断提高。有的勘探工人劳动效率提高408％。全队的成本比去年降低40％。这个队已经提前四十八天完成了上半年的生产计划，成为工业战线上的一面红旗。
    新华社布加勒斯特24日电　据重工业部、石油和化学工业部、运输和电讯部和消费品工业部四个部门不完全的统计，今年上半年共采用了近二万条革新和合理化建议，预计到年底共可节约三亿多列伊（罗币）。
    今年有更多的工人参加技术革新。无机化学工业部去年上半年有四百多名工人革新者，今年上半年就有五百多人。西那雅“约·弗里姆”机器制造厂的工人提出了“三个工人中要有一个革新者”的指标。
    当前技术革新的中心口号是节约原材料，提高设备利用率和推广先进技术操作及工艺规程。斯大林城恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂提出了“每月至少有两天用节约下来的材料进行生产”的竞赛。布加勒斯特，普洛什蒂和底密索拉的许多冶金工厂的工人都参加了这个竞赛。
    由于进行了技术革新，许多工厂都提前超额完成了上半年的生产任务。布加勒斯特“共和国”轧管厂提前十九天完成了上半年的生产任务。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂也提前十三天完成了上半年的生产任务，节约了三千七百多万列伊。
    为了更大幅度地增加生产和提高劳动生产率，罗马尼亚工人党中央和部长会议在7月初作出了关于提高生产技术水平的决议。“红旗”汽车工厂有四千多人讨论了这个决议，其中的三百多人提出了各种各样的革新建议。“台尔曼”拖拉机工厂有三千九百人参加了讨论，提出了四百二十多条革新建议。
