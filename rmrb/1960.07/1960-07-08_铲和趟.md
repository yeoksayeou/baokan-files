    Shoveling and Tilling

    In Northeast China, crop cultivation generally follows the ridge planting method. Therefore, summer weeding includes two main components: "shoveling" and "tilling." "Shoveling" refers to using tools to loosen the soil between crop rows and remove weeds. "Tilling" is the process of earthing up the soil around the crop plants after shoveling. In Northeast China, shoveling and tilling are effectively the same as the middle cultivation and earthing up practices used in summer field management in regions like North China.

    Weeds are a major enemy of crops, and their harm is no less than natural disasters like floods, droughts, winds, and pests. Shoveling and tilling in the fields is an effective measure to eliminate weeds.

    铲和趟
    东北地区栽培农作物，一般沿用垅作，因此夏锄包括两个主要内容，即“铲”和“趟”。“铲”就是用工具松动作物行间的土层，并除掉杂草。“趟”是铲了以后对作物植株的培土。东北地区的铲趟实际上就是华北等地区夏季田间管理中的中耕培土。
    杂草也是农作物的一个大敌，它的为害不下于水、旱、风、虫等自然灾害。对大田铲趟正是消灭杂草的有效措施。
