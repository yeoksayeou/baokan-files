Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Confederation on the 9th, expressing full support for the Cuban people's reasonable measures to requisition American-owned enterprises in Cuba.
	
The telegram stated that American imperialism is attempting to put pressure on the Cuban people by reducing Cuba's sugar import quota and is actively plotting armed intervention in order to achieve the conspiracy of strangling the Cuban revolution and re-enslaving the Cuban people. The Chinese working class strongly condemns this malicious conspiracy of American imperialism and fully supports the Cuban people's reasonable measures to requisition American-owned enterprises in Cuba in order to counter American aggression, safeguard national sovereignty, and defend the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to the Cuban Socialist Youth League, the Student Department of the Cuban July 26th Movement, the Cuban University Students' Federation, the Cuban Revolutionary Directorate, and the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Federation, severely condemning American imperialism's subversion and aggression against Cuba, as well as the conspiracy to economically strangle the Cuban revolution, and expressing resolute support for the Cuban people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

The telegram stated that American imperialism has always regarded the Cuban revolution as a thorn in its side and has never stopped its conspiracy of subversion and aggression against it; recently, it has blatantly reduced Cuba's sugar import quota,妄想妄想妄想妄想 to economically strangle the Cuban revolution. American imperialism has once again demonstrated by its actions that it is the most ferocious enemy of the Cuban and Latin American people. American imperialism, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and has done all kinds of bad things, will not succeed in any of its conspiracies. It will inevitably lift a rock only to drop it on its own feet.

The telegram pointed out that the series of resolute measures recently taken by the Cuban government to oppose American imperialist aggression, safeguard national sovereignty, and develop the national economy are completely correct and just. It has not only received the enthusiastic support of the Cuban people and youth, but also the sympathy and support of the people of Latin America and the world for the Cuban people's patriotic and just struggle. The Cuban people's resolute struggle against American imperialism has also greatly encouraged the anti-imperialist, patriotic, and just struggles of the people of Latin America and other countries around the world. The Chinese people and youth students greatly admire the heroic spirit of the Cuban people in despising, disdaining, and hating American imperialism. Every struggle you wage against American imperialism will receive the firm support of the Chinese people and youth students. The conspiracy of American imperialism to interfere in the Cuban revolution will inevitably fail even more miserably than the last. Victory will surely belong to the united and indomitable Cuban people.

　　我全总、全国青联和学联致电
　　坚决支持古巴人民反美斗争
    新华社10日讯　中华全国总工会9日致电古巴工人联合会，表示全力支持古巴人民采取征用美国在古巴的企业的合理措施。
    电报说，美帝国主义企图用削减古巴食糖进口的份额对古巴人民施加压力，并积极策划武装干涉，以达到扼杀古巴革命和重新奴役古巴人民的阴谋。中国工人阶级强烈谴责美帝国主义这一恶毒阴谋，并全力支持古巴人民为反击美国侵略、维护国家主权、保卫革命而采取征用美国在古巴的企业的合理措施。
    新华社11日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天打电报给古巴社会主义青年联盟、古巴7月26日运动学生部、古巴大学生联合会、古巴革命指导委员会、古巴起义军青年联合会，严厉谴责美帝国主义对古巴的颠覆和侵略以及从经济上扼杀古巴革命的阴谋，表示坚决支持古巴人的反美爱国正义斗争。
    电报说，美帝国主义一直把古巴革命看作是眼中钉，一刻也没有停止过对它的颠覆和侵略的阴谋活动；最近又悍然削减古巴食糖进口定额，妄想从经济上扼杀古巴革命。美帝国主义又一次以事实证明自己是古巴和拉丁美洲人民最凶恶的敌人。外强中干、做尽坏事的美帝国主义，它的任何阴谋诡计都是不会得逞的。它必然是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    电报指出，古巴政府最近采取的一系列坚决反对美帝国主义侵略、维护国家主权和发展民族经济的措施是完全正确的正义的。它不但受到了古巴人民和青年的热烈拥护，拉丁美洲及全世界人民也都同情和支持古巴人民的爱国正义斗争。古巴人民坚决反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争也大大地鼓舞着拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的反帝爱国正义斗争。中国人民和青年学生十分敬佩古巴人民蔑视鄙视仇视美帝国主义的英雄气概，你们每一个反对美帝国主义的斗争都会得到中国人民和青年学生的坚决支持。美帝国主义干涉古巴革命的阴谋必将一个比一个失败得更惨。胜利一定属于团结一致和坚强不屈的古巴人民。
