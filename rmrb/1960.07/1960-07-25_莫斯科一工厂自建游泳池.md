    A Moscow Factory Builds its Own Swimming Pool
    The workers of Moscow's First Housing Construction United Factory built an indoor swimming pool with their own hands in their spare time. The factory's young workers used materials saved by the factory and built it themselves, creating good conditions for swimming all year round.
    The completed swimming pool has two floors, including a twenty-five meter long swimming pool, grandstand, shower rooms and lounge. The vast number of swimming enthusiasts often hold various competitions here, exercise, and improve their sports skills.

    莫斯科一工厂自建游泳池
    莫斯科第一房屋建筑联合工厂的工人在业余时间用自己的双手盖起了室内游泳池。工厂的青年工人用工厂节省下来的材料，自己动手修建，为一年四季开展游泳运动创造了良好条件。
    落成的游泳馆有两层楼高，里面有二十五米长的游泳池、看台、淋浴室和休息室。广大的游泳爱好者经常在这里举行各种比赛、锻炼身体，提高体育技巧。
