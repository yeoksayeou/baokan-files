    This newspaper, Nanning, 15th. Guangxi is vigorously implementing the decision of the Standing Committee Enlarged Meeting of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on taking agriculture as the foundation, grain as the key link, and comprehensively strengthening rural work. The 60,000 cadres drawn from the autonomous region, prefectures, counties, and communes, forming the summer harvest and planting work team, have gone deep into the production teams and the fields to assist the rural people's communes and production teams in doing a good job in the current harvesting, management, and planting of early, mid-, and late-season crops.
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Regional Party Committee was held at the end of last month. The meeting mainly discussed how to seize the central link of agriculture to promote the development of the entire national economy. The meeting pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the agricultural production situation in the autonomous region has been very good, but it has also encountered a severe drought unprecedented since liberation. Currently, it is the busy season for summer harvesting and planting. Therefore, fighting drought, preventing drought, and grasping the harvesting, management, and planting of early, mid-, and late-season crops to strive for a bumper harvest is the primary task of the entire party. To accomplish this task, party organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over agriculture. Party organizations at all levels should compress the number of personnel remaining in offices as much as possible, transfer a large number of cadres to rural areas, and truly strengthen the leadership of communes and teams. In terms of drought resistance and prevention, the first priority is to focus on conserving paddy fields, concentrating labor and fertilizer to strive for increased yields. Second, plant more drought-resistant and high-yielding miscellaneous grain crops. In areas with severe drought, decisive action must be taken to change crops. Third, make every effort to repair and dig channels, install water pumps, and expand irrigation areas. Fourth, do a good job in water management, timely store and intercept water, and avoid wasting water or allowing it to be lost.
    Actively promoting the technological transformation of agriculture is another measure to strive for continued agricultural leap forward this year. Currently, the first priority is to guarantee the various raw materials, tools, and equipment needed for water conservancy construction, and complete them according to the established plan, with quality, quantity, and on time. Accelerate the production of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery and continuously expand the water conservation area of farmland. To this end, we must strengthen the existing machinery factories in each special zone and county to specialize in producing agricultural machinery needed in the region. Vigorously promote various improved agricultural tools and new agricultural machines. Currently, we must pay special attention to the promotion and use of vehicles, boats, and rice transplanters. Implement a three-pronged approach of raising pigs, planting green manure, and producing chemical fertilizers to solve the fertilizer problem.
    Ensuring the labor force necessary for agricultural production and making proper arrangements for labor are very important tasks at present. The meeting decided that various measures must be taken to strictly prohibit the waste of labor. The labor force used for field production should be maintained at 70% of the total rural labor force, and can be increased to 80% during the busy farming season. In order to mobilize enough labor to the field production, the communes should reduce the labor force from non-agricultural production, try not to engage in non-productive construction, and shut down community-run enterprises unrelated to agricultural production that can be shut down.
    All sectors of society should, without exception, regard supporting agriculture as their glorious task. In terms of industrial support for agriculture, steel should still be the key link, and we should focus on steel production to drive the production of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fuels, and building materials. From now on, a mass movement upsurge to run iron and steel on a large scale should be launched throughout the region. All agricultural machinery factories should, in addition to ensuring planned production, make great efforts to comprehensively utilize raw materials and materials, and solve the steel needed for agricultural machinery through self-reliance.
    After the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Regional Party Committee, a mass movement with agriculture as the foundation and all sectors supporting agriculture is taking shape. The form of "factory-commune linking" for mutual support is rapidly being promoted. Many areas have followed the instructions of the Regional Party Committee and resolutely adjusted labor use. Each county in Wuzhou Special Zone has adjusted more than 60,000 laborers from all aspects and sent them to the first line of agricultural production. Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the forefront of production, participating in production and directing production. In Guilin Special Zone, since the 25th of last month, all cadres below the commune level have left their offices, eating, living, and holding meetings in the fields. After adjusting its organization, the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred one-third of its cadres to rural areas to strengthen the leadership of communes and brigades.

    This newspaper, Yinchuan, 15th. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has recently taken a series of important measures to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, focusing on agricultural production, and strengthening and supporting the agricultural production front with superior forces.
    The Regional Party Committee recently focused on studying and discussing this issue at an enlarged meeting. Based on the favorable conditions for agricultural development in the autonomous region and the current excellent situation in rural areas, as well as some major issues existing in agriculture, the Regional Party Committee determined that it is necessary to start with current production and take a series of measures in terms of ideology, organization, and work style to ensure the great development of agricultural production. These measures are: (1) Consolidate the view of taking agriculture as the center in the whole party. From now on, party organizations at all levels should widely conduct education on agriculture as the foundation of the national economy among all cadres, so that every cadre truly recognizes the great significance of developing agriculture for the development of the entire national economy from an ideological standpoint. (2) Closely contact the masses and thoroughly change the style of work. It is required that more than 70% of the cadres from various systems at the autonomous region level go deep into rural areas and factories to participate in production and lead production. All cadres who go to the countryside and factories must constantly develop the fine style of eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, so as to share weal and woe with the masses. Communes in various places must earnestly implement the "two-five" leadership method according to the specific conditions of the local area. (3) Comprehensively strengthen support for agriculture. Industry and capital construction should prioritize projects serving agriculture. Industries run by counties and communes should wholeheartedly serve agriculture, and continue to focus on the manufacturing, repairing, and assembling of farm tools, as well as indigenous fertilizers and pesticides. In terms of basic agricultural construction, it is required to shorten the battle line, seize key points, and fight annihilation battles to strive for the early exertion of irrigation benefits from existing projects. (4) In order to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, all work must start with current production, especially in the arrangement of labor, and we must firmly grasp the harvesting, planting, and management of summer and autumn crops. At present, the three aspects of harvesting, planting, and management are proceeding simultaneously in agricultural production in the Ningxia area. Therefore, from the current summer harvest to the end of the autumn harvest, all localities should not only organize the broad masses of commune members to rush harvest, harvest cleanly, thresh quickly, and store quickly, so as to ensure that every grain is stored in granaries, but also organize commune members to seize the opportunity to replant and increase the replanting area as much as possible. At the same time, they should also do a good job in the field management of autumn fields to ensure a bumper harvest this year.
    Now, party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region have universally taken action in accordance with these decisions and measures of the autonomous region Party Committee. Since July 10, various systems at the autonomous region level have successively gone deep into the front line of production under the leadership of several secretaries of the Secretariat of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. In each county (city) in the region, there has been one or more departments taking charge of specific tasks to assist in the work. About 90% of the cadres in each county (city), led by the First Secretary, have also invested in the most intense current work of summer harvesting, summer planting, and autumn field management. Comprehensive support for agriculture has formed a widespread mass movement throughout the region. All sectors of society regard supporting agriculture as their glorious task and have carried out various support activities from manpower and material resources according to the business characteristics of their units. In terms of labor arrangements, all counties and cities have also concentrated all their efforts and invested in current production, and are determined to fight a big battle in the key season of agricultural production in July, August, and September to win a bumper harvest this year.

　　广西、宁夏全面加强农业生产战线
　　集中力量收好管好种好夏秋作物
　　基层领导力量和田间生产劳力大大增强　各行各业支援农业形成群众运动
    本报南宁15日电　广西各地正大力贯彻执行中共广西僮族自治区委员会常委扩大会议关于以农业为基础、以粮为纲，全面加强农村工作的决定。自治区、地、县、公社抽调的六万干部组成的夏收夏种工作团，已分别深入生产队，深入田间，协助农村各人民公社、生产队做好当前的早、中、晚造作物的收、管、种工作。
    区党委常委扩大会议是在上月底召开的。会议主要讨论了如何抓住农业这个中心环节，来促进整个国民经济的发展问题。会议指出：今年以来，自治区的农业生产形势很好，但也遇上了解放以来所没有的大旱，当前又值夏收夏种大忙季节，因此，抗旱防旱，抓好早、中、晚造作物的收、管、种，争取农业丰收，是当前全党首
  要的任务。为了完成这个任务，各级党组织必须加强对农业的领
  导。各级党组织应尽量压缩留守机关，调出大量干部深入农村，切
  切实实增强社队领导力量。在抗旱防旱方面，首先要抓好保水田，要集中劳力和肥料，力争水田增产。其次多种耐旱高产的杂粮作物，旱情严重的地区，必须当机立断，坚决改种。第三，尽最大努力，修挖渠道，安装抽水机，扩大灌溉面积。第四，做好用水管理，及时蓄水拦水，不要浪费水和让水流失。
    积极推行农业的技术改造，是争取今年农业继续跃进的又一项措施。目前，首先要保证水利建设所需要的各种原材料、工具和设备，照既定计划，按质按量按时完成。加速生产农业排灌机械，不断扩大农田保水面积。为此，必须加强各专区、县已有的机械厂，专门生产本区所需的农业机械。大力推广各种改良农具和新式农业机器，当前要特别抓好车、船和插秧机的推广使用工作。实行养猪，种绿肥，生产化肥三者并举，解决肥料问题。
    保证农业生产所必需的劳动力，作好劳力的安排，是目前一个十分重要的任务。会议决定必须采取各种措施，严禁劳动力的浪费现象。用于田间生产的劳动力，要经常保持在占农村总劳动力的70％，农忙时可增至80％。为了把足够的劳动力调集到田间生产方面来，各公社要大力压缩非农业生产的劳动力，尽量不搞非生产性的建设，把与农业生产无关的可停办的社办企业停下来。
    各行各业应当毫无例外地把支援农业当成自己的光荣任务。工业支援农业方面，仍应以钢为纲，全力抓好钢铁生产，来带动农机、化肥、农药、燃料、建筑材料的生产。从现在起，全区掀起一个大办钢铁的群众运动高潮。所有农业机械厂除保证计划生产外，都应大搞原料、材料的综合利用，自力更生解决一部分农业机械用钢需要。
    区党委常委扩大会议后，一个以农业为基础，各行各业支援农业的群众运动正在形成。“厂社挂钩”互相支援的形式迅速推广。许多地区已遵照区党委的指示，在劳动力使用上坚决作了调整。梧州专区各县已从各方面调整出六万多劳动力，开赴农业生产第一线。各级领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，参加生产，指挥生产。桂林专区从上月25日起，所有公社以下干部一律离开办公室，吃、住、开会在田间。中共柳州地委经过调整机构，已将三分之一的干部下放到农村，加强公社、大队的领导力量。
    本报银川15日电　中共宁夏回族自治区委员会最近采取一系列的重要措施，贯彻以农业为基础的方针，狠抓农业生产，并以优势的力量加强和支援农业生产战线。
    最近自治区党委在召开的扩大会议上，着重研究和讨论了这一问题。会议根据自治区农业发展的有利条件和农村目前的大好形势，以及在农业方面存在的一些主要问题，自治区党委确定，必须从当前生产入手，在思想上、组织上和工作作风等方面采取一系列的措施，以保证农业生产大发展。这些措施是：（1）巩固地在全党树立起以农业为中心的观点，各级党组织从现在开始，就要在全体干部中广泛地进行一次农业是国民经济基础的教育，务使每一个干部都从思想上真正认识到发展农业对发展整个国民经济的重大意义。（2）密切联系群众，彻底改变作风。要求自治区一级各系统抽调70％以上的干部深入农村、工厂，参加生产、领导生产；所有下乡下厂的干部都要不断发扬与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的优良作风，作到与群众同甘共苦；各地公社都必须根据当地具体情况，认真实行“二五”制的领导方法。（3）全面加强对农业的支援。工业和基本建设方面都要优先安排为农业服务的项目，县社办的工业，要全力为农业服务，要继续大抓农具制造修配和土化肥、土农药。在农业基本建设方面，要求缩短战线，抓住重点，打歼灭战，以争取现有的一些工程早日发挥灌溉效益。（4）为了争取今年农业生产大丰收，一切工作都必须从当前生产入手，特别是在劳动力安排上，要狠狠抓好夏秋作物的收、种、管。目前宁夏地区农业生产上的收、种、管三方面正在同时进行，因此从现在的夏收开始到秋收结束，各地不但要组织广大社员进行抢收、收净、快打、快藏，做到颗粒归仓，而且还要组织社员抓紧复种，尽量增加复种面积，同时也要做好秋田的田间管理工作，保证今年的大丰收。
    现在，自治区各级党组织根据自治区党委的这些决定和措施，已普遍行动起来了。自治区一级各系统，从7月10日起，已在自治区党委书记处的几位书记的领导下，纷纷深入生产第一线，全区每一个县（市），都已有一个或几个厅局分工包干，协助工作，各县 （市）也有90％左右的干部，由第一书记率领投入了当前最紧张的夏收、夏种、秋田管理工作。全面支援农业已在全区形成一个广泛的群众运动，各行各业都把支援农业当成自己光荣的任务，并且根据本单位的业务特点，从人力物力等方面进行了各种支援活动。各县市在劳动力安排上，也都集中全力，投入当前的生产，并决心大战7、8、9月这一农业生产上的关键季节，夺取今年大丰收。
