Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th—In order to promote phonetic literacy, realize a province without illiteracy ahead of schedule, and accelerate the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to change the Shanxi Peasant Newspaper to the Shanxi Phonetic Newspaper. This newspaper was launched on July 1st.

In addition to relying on the addition of Hanyu Pinyin to help the masses learn to read, the Shanxi Phonetic Newspaper also popularizes the Party's policies and guidelines, publicizes current affairs at home and abroad, and introduces advanced experiences, new people, new things, and scientific and technological knowledge in socialist construction in various places.

Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote inscriptions for the inaugural issue.

    山西注音报创刊
    新华社太原4日电　中共山西省委为了推广注音识字，提前实现为没有文盲的省，加速工农群众知识化，决定把山西农民报改为山西注音报，这个报纸已在7月1日创刊。
    山西注音报除依靠加注汉语拼音帮助群众识字外，还通俗地宣传党的方针政策，宣传国内外时事，介绍各地社会主义建设的先进经验、新人新事和科学技术知识。
    中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章和中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳为创刊号题了词。
