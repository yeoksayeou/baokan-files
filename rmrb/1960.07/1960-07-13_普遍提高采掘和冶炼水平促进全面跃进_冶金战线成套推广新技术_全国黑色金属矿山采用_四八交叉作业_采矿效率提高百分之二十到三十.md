　　This newspaper reports: The national metallurgical industry departments are taking various forms to vigorously promote advanced experiences and new production technologies. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has successively organized several on-site conferences to promote advanced experiences; the iron and steel industry system, while carrying out technical performance competitions in various factories, specially organized eight technical performance teams, with more than 100 advanced producers and innovation experts participating, and conducted a tour of technical performances in twelve provinces and cities. Recently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also organized cadres from relevant design institutes and research institutes, forming seventy-five working groups, to go deep into metallurgical enterprises in various places to help promote advanced experiences.
    In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, thousands of advanced experiences and new technologies have emerged on the metallurgical industry front, including ore mining and beneficiation, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, refractory material production, non-ferrous metal smelting, metallurgical construction, geological exploration, design, and other aspects. These advanced experiences and new technologies, after being summarized, improved, and matched, have been selected by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry as a batch of relatively mature and universally applicable projects, which are being promoted in the national metallurgical industry departments. Most of them have been applied to the design of new metallurgical enterprises.
    The widespread implementation of these advanced experiences and new technologies will have a significant effect on improving production levels and product quality, saving raw materials and material consumption, reducing costs, and improving workers' working conditions after a period of time. For example, advanced operating experience in ironmaking has been universally promoted in small blast furnaces across the country, and large and medium-sized blast furnaces in Anshan, Benxi, and other places have also successfully applied this experience. For example, after the technical performance team arrived in Sichuan Province, they conducted eight "one-stop" technical performances from coke ovens, sintering ore, hot blast stoves, blowers to blast furnace production, using their own experiences to promote the advanced experience of small blast furnaces. After the Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant conducted a technical performance, the daily production level of pig iron increased by 25% to 50%. The workers excitedly said: "Now I understand, small blast furnaces can not only catch up with large blast furnaces, but also surpass large blast furnaces." In May, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in Sichuan Province increased by 16% compared with January.
    In terms of ore mining, the "four-eight cross operation" experience pioneered by the coal mine system has been universally promoted in national ferrous metal mines, and is also being promoted in non-ferrous metal mines. According to the results of the implementation in ferrous metal mines, mining efficiency has generally increased by 20% to 30%. At the same time, a new mining technology policy is also being widely promoted in ferrous metal and non-ferrous metal mines, which has also greatly increased mining efficiency and ore production.
    In terms of steelmaking, the advanced experience of converter steelmaking has been promoted relatively quickly. In order to promote the advanced experience of converter steelmaking, the Tangshan Steel Plant specially established a command, personally directed by the party secretary and factory director. The steelmaking workers organized twenty-eight "combat teams," found their own materials, and made their own equipment. After more than a month of efforts, the steel plant comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of converter steelmaking, making the time for each furnace of steel, the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel, and the quality of steel all significantly improved compared with the past.
    Saving coal is an important task for the metallurgical industry departments this year. In response to this key issue, the employees of metallurgical enterprises in various places have vigorously carried out coal gasification, widely used coal gas in production, and created many very good advanced experiences in coking.

　　普遍提高采掘和冶炼水平促进全面跃进
　　冶金战线成套推广新技术
　　全国黑色金属矿山采用“四八交叉作业”采矿效率提高百分之二十到三十
    本报讯　全国冶金工业部门正在采取多种形式，大力推广先进经验和生产新技术。冶金工业部已经先后组织了多次推广先进经验的现场会议；钢铁工业系统在各厂大搞技术表演赛的同时，专门组织了八个技术表演队，由一百多名先进生产者和革新能手参加，先后到十二个省、市进行了巡回技术表演。最近，冶金工业部又组织各有关设计院、研究院的干部，组成了七十五个工作组，深入到各地冶金企业，帮助推广先进经验。
    在如火如荼的技术革新和技术革命运动中，冶金工业战线出现了成千上万项先进经验和新技术，包括采选矿石、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、耐火材料生产、有色金属冶炼、冶金建筑、地质勘探、设计等各个方面。这些先进经验和新技术，经过总结、提高和配套，已由冶金工业部选定了一批比较成熟和能够普遍推广的项目，正在全国冶金工业部门推广。其中大部分已经被运用到新建冶金企业的设计中。
    这些先进经验和新技术的广泛推行，对于提高生产水平和产品质量，节约原料、材料消耗和降低成本，以及改善职工劳动条件，经过一个时期将会产生显著成效。例如，炼铁方面的先进操作经验，已经在全国小高炉上普遍推广，鞍山、本溪等地的大中型高炉也成功地运用了这一经验。像技术表演队到四川省后，从焦炉、烧结矿石、热风炉、鼓风机到高炉生产，进行了八次“一条龙”的技术表演，用现身说法，推广了小高炉的先进经验。成都钢铁厂在进行技术表演后，生铁日产水平提高了25％到50％，工人们兴奋地说：“这一下我心里亮堂了，小高炉不仅可以赶上大高炉，而且可以超过大高炉。”5月份四川全省小高炉平均利用系数，比1月份提高了16％。
    在采掘矿石方面，煤矿系统首创的“四八交叉作业”经验，已经在全国黑色金属矿山普遍推广，有色金属矿山也正在推广。根据黑色金属矿山推行的结果，采矿效率普遍提高了20％到30％。同时，黑色金属和有色金属矿山上还在广泛推行一种新的采掘技术方针，也使采掘效率和矿石产量大幅度地提高。
    炼钢方面推广得较快的是转炉炼钢的先进经验。唐山钢厂为了推广转炉炼钢的先进经验，曾经专门成立了指挥部，由党委书记、厂长亲自指挥。炼钢工人们组织了二十八个“战斗小组”，自找材料，自制设备。这个钢厂经过一个多月的努力，全面推行了转炉炼钢的先进经验，使每炼一炉钢的时间，每吨钢的生铁消耗量，以及钢的质量，都比过去有显著的改进。
    节约煤炭是今年冶金工业部门的一项重要任务。各地冶金企业职工针对这个关键问题，大搞煤气化，在生产上广泛使用煤气，并且在炼焦方面创造了很多很好的先进经验。
