Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 12th: United Arab Republic President Nasser, in his speech at the opening ceremony of the National Union Congress on the evening of the 9th, discussed the UAR's domestic and foreign policies. He is the chairman of this sole legal political organization in the UAR.

	Nasser spoke about the UAR people's experience in striving for national independence. He said that this experience has made the UAR believe that it must strive for peace, oppose military alliances, and implement a policy of "active neutrality" and "non-alignment." He said, we extend our hand to all countries, large and small. Therefore, we extend our hand, hoping to cooperate with the United States and the Soviet Union, the largest countries of our time.

	He continued, "We are very pleased that when we extended our hand to the Soviet Union, we were warmly received. Therefore, we were able to establish friendly relations with the Soviet people on an equal basis with the Arab people. The close economic cooperation between us has strengthened this friendship, most notably manifested in the Soviet Union's assistance in building the (Aswan) High Dam project. The Soviet Union's clear stance in supporting our main anti-imperialist struggle has also strengthened this friendship."

	He then said, "We greatly regret that when we extended our hand to the United States, we did not receive the treatment we had hoped for, because the United States' position is linked to the policies of the imperialist countries, whose brutal rule we have experienced and which continue to attempt to establish their rule over us." He said that the United States' policy has failed to recognize that the Arab people should be masters of their own destiny. Nasser also expressed regret over the United States' collusion with international Zionism and the agents of reactionaries, saying, "Despite this, American policy does not understand this matter to this day."

	Nasser also spoke about the domestic situation, pointing out that the "public sector economy" must continue to be developed, while private capital must be protected.

	Nasser also announced at the conference that the UAR had built its first jet trainer aircraft.

　　纳赛尔谈阿联国内外政策
　　阿联要实行“积极中立”和“不结盟”政策
　　向一切大小国家伸手　希望同美苏合作
    新华社开罗12日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔9日晚上在民族联盟代表大会开幕式上发表演说，谈阿联的国内外政策。他是阿联的这个唯一合法政治组织的主席。
    纳赛尔谈到了阿联人民争取民族独立的经验。他说，这种经验使阿联相信必须争取和平、反对军事联盟，并且实行“积极中立”和“不结盟”的政策。他说，我们向一切大小国家伸出我们的手。因此我们伸出我们的手，希望同我们当代最大的国家美国和苏联合作。
    他接着说，“我们感到很高兴的是，当我们向苏联伸出手的时候，得到了热烈的对待，因此我们能够在阿拉伯人民和苏联人民平等的基础上建立友好的关系，我们之间密切的经济合作加强了这种友谊，这种合作最显著地表现在苏联帮助建设（阿斯旺）高水坝工程上，苏联在支持我们的主要反帝斗争中所采取的明确立场也加强了这种友谊。”
    他接着说：“我们感到莫大遗憾的是，当我们向美国伸出手的时候，我们得不到我们所希望得到的对待，因为美国的立场是同各帝国主义国家的政策连在一起的，对于这种国家的残暴统治我们是经历过的，它们还继续企图建立对我们的统治。”他说，美国的政策没有认识到阿拉伯人民应该是他们自己命运的主人。纳赛尔还对美国同国际犹太复国主义和反动派的代理人勾结感到遗憾，他说，“尽管这样，美国的政策迄今并不了解这件事。”
    纳赛尔还谈到国内情况，他指出要继续发展“公营部分经济”，同时要保护私人资本。
    纳赛尔还在大会上宣布阿联第一次建造了一架教练用的喷气式飞机。
