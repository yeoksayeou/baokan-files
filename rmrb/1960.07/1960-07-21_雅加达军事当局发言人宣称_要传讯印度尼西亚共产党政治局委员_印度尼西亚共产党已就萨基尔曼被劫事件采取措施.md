Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Antara News Agency reports that a spokesman for the Jakarta Military District Command declared on the 19th that Jakarta military authorities intend to summon members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party to explain the party’s recent statement criticizing the government. The spokesman said this refers to the statement issued by the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on July 8th regarding the work of the Indonesian Working Cabinet over the past year.

The army spokesman believes that this statement by the Indonesian Communist Party "has caused unease and confusion in broad sections of society, which may reduce the prestige of the government." He said, "A report on this matter has been submitted to the Supreme War Authority."

Edi, a spokesman for the Jakarta Local War Authority, announced on the 18th that "the Supreme War Authority has been notified of this matter, and any related issues will be resolved as soon as possible." The spokesman said that "in order to maintain law and order and public safety," "the Jakarta War Authority, with all the rights it has been given," will "investigate" the members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party and "require them to provide explanations."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 19th: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a press release yesterday, announcing the measures taken by the Central Committee regarding the abduction of Sakirman, Third Deputy Chairman of the National Planning Council and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, by soldiers on July 16th.

The press release stated that in addition to submitting the issue to the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, the Party Central Committee has taken the following measures: 1. Submitting the issue to President Sukarno for resolution; 2. Raising the issue with the Vice Chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council; 3. Assigning members of the Party Central Committee to inquire with the Supreme War Authority about the true circumstances of Sakirman's arrest; 4. The Secretariat of the Party Central Committee has learned that Sakirman himself has protested this unreasonable means of abduction through the leadership of the National Planning Council.

It is also reported that Mrs. Mudijati and Mrs. Sundari, Indonesian Communist Party members of parliament, met with Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan for the second time on the morning of the 18th regarding the above issue.

    印度尼西亚共产党已就萨基尔曼被劫事件采取措施
    新华社20日讯　据安塔拉通讯社报道，雅加达军区司令部发言人19日宣称，雅加达军事当局要传讯印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员们，要他们去说明这个党最近发表的批评政府的声明。这个发言人说，这是指印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局7月8日就一年来印度尼西亚工作内阁工作发表的声明。
    这个陆军发言人认为，印度尼西亚共产党的这篇声明“在社会的广泛阶层中引起了不安和混乱，这可能降低政府的威信。”他说，“一项关于这件事情的报告已经提交给最高战时掌权者。”
    雅加达地方战时掌权者发言人埃迪18日宣布“最高战时掌权者已经得到关于这件事情的通知，任何与此有关的问题将尽快解决。”这个发言人说，“为了维护法律和秩序以及公共安全”，“雅加达战时掌权者以他所受到的一切权利”，要对印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员们“进行调查，要求他们作出说明”。
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处昨天发表新闻公报，宣布了中央委员会就国家计划委员会第三副主席、印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员萨基尔曼于7月16日被军人带走一事所采取的措施。
    公报说，党中央委员会除了向最高检察署提出这个问题以外，还采取了下列措施：一、把这个问题提交苏加诺总统解决；二、向最高评议院副主席提出这个问题；三、指派了党中央委员会委员向最高战时掌权当局探询萨基尔曼被捕的真实情况；四、党中央委员会书记处获悉，萨基尔曼本人已通过国家计划委员会的领导对于把他带走的这种无理手段提出抗议。
    印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地和副主席约多今天参加了最高评议院会议。艾地在答复问题时对报界说，他已经向苏加诺提出了萨基尔曼问题。他说，苏加诺接受了这个问题，并且将处理这个问题。
    另据报道，印度尼西亚共产党的合作国会议员穆迪迪约夫人和顺达里夫人就上述问题于18日上午第二次会晤了印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万。会见后，贡纳万在答报界问时说，他不愿作任何解释。
