    A mass movement of industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting the countryside is being launched throughout the country. Every industrial and mining enterprise, every transportation enterprise, and every employee must establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and strive more consciously to support the current struggle against drought and waterlogging, to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, and to support agricultural technical transformation and gradually realize agricultural modernization.
    Industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting the countryside is not only a requirement for the development of agriculture but also a requirement for the development of industry, transportation, and other economic undertakings. Our country is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80% of the national population. It is these more than 80% of the people who use their agricultural (including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery) production to supply the food and non-staple food needed by the industrial front and urban development; to supply the main raw materials for light industry; and to supplement the labor force of the industrial front. It is precisely this 80% plus population and their agricultural production that are the main market for light industrial products and the main market for heavy industrial products such as machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy equipment, electricity, transportation vehicles, civilian fuel, and building materials. Without developed agriculture, there would be no developed light industry, and it would be difficult to build a strong heavy industry. In his famous report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of my country's First Five-Year Plan construction, when talking about the relationship between agriculture and industry, said: "During the Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan, if our agriculture can have greater development, so that light industry will have correspondingly more development, this will be beneficial to the entire national economy. When agriculture and light industry develop, heavy industry will have a market and funds, and it will develop faster. In this way, the speed of industrialization may seem slower, but in reality, it will not be slow, or it may even be faster.” The great practice of our country's continuous leap forward in industry and agriculture for two consecutive years since 1958 and the continued leap forward this year have proved how correct Comrade Mao Zedong’s assertion is! Now, it is becoming increasingly clear to us that only on the basis of great agricultural development can industry, transportation, commerce, and other economic undertakings develop both at high speed and in proportion, and the lives of the broad masses of urban and rural people can be gradually improved.
    We Marxists must not only correctly reflect and understand the objective world, but more importantly, use objective laws to transform the objective world. Therefore, after the working class has established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, it must better implement the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, and industry as the leading factor, as stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture and striving to basically realize agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and a considerable degree of electrification in about ten years is a great task of strategic significance. Economically speaking, this is because only agriculture equipped with modern technology, that is, agriculture that combines modern technology with the people’s commune, the most advanced organizational form, can improve agricultural labor efficiency faster and better, supply more grain and non-staple food for the development of cities and industrial and mining areas, supply more raw materials for light industry, open up larger markets for light industry and heavy industry, and deliver more labor and accumulate more funds for the development of industry. That is to say, only modernized agriculture can guarantee the continuous leap forward of the entire national economy. Politically speaking, this is to further consolidate and develop the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. Before agricultural cooperativization, the alliance of workers and peasants in our country was based on the fact that industry was mainly socialist ownership by the whole people and agriculture was mainly individual private ownership, and their technical foundations were also different: industry was mainly modern technology, and agriculture was mainly manual technology. After agricultural cooperativization, especially after the people's communes were established, agriculture also became socialist ownership. Although there are still differences between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership in the means of production in industry and agriculture, it is closer than before, and the alliance of workers and peasants has been greatly consolidated and developed on this basis. However, the contradiction between advanced industrial technology and backward agricultural technology still exists. Now, accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is to gradually resolve this contradiction and further develop the alliance of workers and peasants on the basis of socialist ownership and modern technology. Therefore, to establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, we must better support the technical transformation of agriculture. Not only enterprises specializing in manufacturing agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and building materials should support the technical transformation of agriculture, but all walks of life should support the technical transformation of agriculture. Every enterprise, whether central, local, large, or small, should regard supporting agriculture as its bounden duty and responsibility. Every enterprise should, under the leadership of the local party committee, take the initiative to link up with the rural people's communes and production brigades, and vigorously support agriculture in implementing technical transformation in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner from all aspects such as helping to establish farm tool manufacturing and repair factories, establishing agricultural and sideline product processing factories, establishing small power stations, and training technical talents.
    The above-mentioned technical transformation of agriculture refers to replacing backward manual operations with modern advanced technology, which is a long-term and fundamental goal. However, from the immediate perspective, the most urgent task of industry in supporting agriculture is to vigorously manufacture irrigation and drainage equipment for agricultural production, strive to increase the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and actively manufacture and repair various agricultural tools and transportation vehicles for agriculture. When supporting people's communes in running industries, we should not deviate from the needs of current agricultural production and engage in those undertakings that are not urgently needed. Supporting communes in running industrial undertakings that are not currently urgently needed and have no direct relationship with agricultural production will instead occupy the human and material resources of agricultural production and hinder agricultural production. At present, we must continue to develop the forms of factory-commune linkages, organizing service teams to go to the countryside to repair tools and impart technology, and directly support the struggle against drought and waterlogging. In particular, factory-commune linkages are a regular and effective organizational form for industrial enterprises to support agriculture, and also a concrete and effective measure to strengthen the ties between workers and peasants and further consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants. We should adhere to it, develop it, and strengthen it. Every enterprise, when producing and repairing machinery, equipment, and various tools for agricultural production, whether large, small, in batches, sporadic, with large output value, or with small output value, must actively do a good job, because this is contributing to strengthening the foundation of national economic development, contributing to strengthening and developing the alliance of workers and peasants, and is the most glorious cause. We must not only ensure that the variety and specifications meet the needs, but also ensure that the quantity is sufficient, the quality is good, and that the use is guaranteed, and also that the technology is imparted. We must take supporting agriculture as a driving force to promote the progress of enterprise production, and the communist style of leaving difficulties to ourselves and giving convenience to others should be greatly promoted in supporting agriculture.
    Ideological work is the soul and commander of economic and business work. With the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation in command, relying on the masses in everything, and solving specific problems in a practical way, we will surely make remarkable achievements in supporting agriculture. This has been repeatedly proven by many facts. The Huaihai Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province, which is now known as a "red flag for supporting agriculture in the Taihang Mountains," is one such example. This is an old factory that was established during the Anti-Japanese War. Its main task is not to manufacture agricultural machinery, but the entire factory, under the slogan "Everyone does one or several good things to support agriculture, and everyone contributes to the technical transformation of agriculture," carried out a vigorous mass movement with one heart and one mind. Since 1958, in addition to manufacturing more than 1,000 sets of equipment such as boiler-camel machines, water pumps, steam turbines, and generators for the people's communes according to the national plan, they have also supported industrial enterprises and 51 commune factories and power stations in 14 counties with more than 100 machine tools, more than 10,000 tools, and more than 80 tons of materials that they have increased production and saved through sending, borrowing, and selling. They have not only trained nearly 1,000 technical talents for the people's communes, but also organized engineering and technical personnel and workers to go to the countryside to help solve technical problems, and organized employees to go to the countryside and mountains to repair farm tools and machinery. In the first half of this year alone, the working hours to help people's communes repair and assemble farm tools reached more than 42,800. Now, this factory has been linked up with 60 people's communes in 12 counties in Jinzhong, Jin Southeast, Jin North, and Jin South. The scale of the Huaihai Machinery Factory is not large, but its deeds in supporting agriculture are very prominent, and its spirit is very admirable and moving. The Huaihai Machinery Factory is not only a red flag in the Taihang Mountains, but also a red flag in the whole country. In the whole country, there are countless factories and mines with material and technical conditions comparable to or exceeding those of the Huaihai Machinery Factory. If everyone regards supporting agriculture as their bounden duty and responsibility like them, then we will surely make even more brilliant achievements than we are making now, and therefore we will surely be able to accelerate the process of agricultural modernization in our country!
    Industrial enterprises must establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, learn from the Huaihai Machinery Factory, and push the mass movement of industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting the countryside to a new climax!

### 工业企业要树立以农业为基础的思想

    工业企业要树立以农业为基础的思想
    一个工业支援农业、城市支援农村的群众运动，已经在全国开展起来。每一个工矿企业、交通运输企业，每一个职工，都要树立以农业为基础的思想，更加自觉地为支援当前的抗旱防涝斗争，争取今年的农业丰收，为支援农业技术改造，逐步地实现农业现代化而奋斗。
    工业支援农业、城市支援农村，不只是发展农业的要求，也是发展工业、交通运输业及其他经济事业的要求。我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的80％以上。正是这80％以上的人用他们从事的农业（包括农、林、牧、副、渔）生产，供给工业战线和城市发展所需要的粮食和副食品；供给轻工业的主要原料；补充工业战线的劳动力。正是这80％以上的人口和他们所从事的农业生产，是轻工业产品的主要市场，是机械、肥料、水利设备、电力、运输工具、民用燃料、建筑材料等等重工业产品的主要市场。没有发达的农业，就没有发达的轻工业，也很难建设起强大的重工业。1957年，毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题》的著名报告中，根据马克思列宁主义的普遍原理和我国第一个五年计划建设的经验，讲到农业和工业的关系时，说：“在第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间，如果我们的农业能够有更大的发展，使轻工业相应地有更多的发展，这对于整个国民经济会有好处。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。这样，看起来工业化的速度似乎慢一些，但是实际上不会慢，或者反而可能快一些。”1958年以来，我国工农业连续两年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进的伟大实践，证明了毛泽东同志的这个论断多么正确！现在，越来越使我们看清楚：只有在农业大发展的基础上，工业、交通运输业、商业及其他经济事业，才能既高速度又按比例地发展，广大城乡人民的生活才能够逐步提高。
    我们马克思主义者，不但要正确地反映和认识客观世界，而且更重要的是运用客观规律改造客观世界。所以工人阶级树立了以农业为基础的思想以后，就要在日常工作中，更好地贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志规定的发展国民经济以农业为基础、以工业为主导的方针，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来。加速农业的技术改造，力争在十年左右基本上实现农业机械化、水利化和相当程度的电气化，这是一个具有战略意义的伟大任务。从经济上讲，这是因为只有以现代技术装备起来的农业，即把现代技术和人民公社这个最先进的组织形式结合起来的农业，才能更快更好地提高农业劳动效率，才能为城市和工矿区的发展供应更多的粮食和副食品，才能为轻工业供应更多的原料，才能为轻工业和重工业开辟更大的市场，才能为工业的发展输送更多的劳动力，积累更多的资金。也就是说，只有现代化的农业，才能保证整个国民经济的持续跃进。从政治上讲，这是进一步巩固和发展工人阶级和农民阶级的联盟。我国的工农联盟，在农业合作化以前，是建立在工业主要是社会主义全民所有制，农业主要是个体私有制的基础上的，它们的技术基础也不同：工业主要是现代技术，农业主要是手工技术。农业合作化以后，特别是人民公社化以后，农业也变成社会主义的所有制了。工业和农业在生产资料所有制上面，虽然还有全民所有制和集体所有制的区别，但比从前接近了，工农联盟在这个基础上得到了很大的巩固和发展。但是，工业技术先进和农业技术落后的矛盾还存在，现在，加速农业的技术改造，就是逐步解决这个矛盾，使工农联盟在社会主义所有制和现代技术的基础上，进一步发展起来。所以，树立以农业为基础的思想，就要更好地支援农业的技术改造。不仅仅是专门制造农业机器、化肥、农药、建筑材料的企业要支援农业的技术改造，各行各业都要支援农业的技术改造。每一个企业，中央的，地方的，大型的，中小型的，都应以支援农业为天职，为己任。每一个企业都要在地方党委的领导下，主动地跟农村人民公社、生产大队挂钩，按照计划有重点、有步骤地从帮助建立农具制造和修理工厂、建立农副产品加工厂、建立小型电站、培养技术人才等各个方面，大力支援农业实行技术改造。
    上面谈到农业的技术改造是以现代的先进技术代替落后的手工操作技术，这是长远的和根本的目标。但是，从眼前来说，工业支援农业最迫切的任务是大力为农业生产制造排灌设备，努力增产化肥和农药，为农业积极制造和修理各种农具和运输工具。支援人民公社办工业的时候，也不要离开当前农业生产的需要，去办那些不是急需的事业，支援公社办目前不急需的和对农业生产没有直接关系的工业事业，反而会占用农业生产的人力物力，妨害农业生产。目前我们要继续发展厂社挂钩、组织服务队下乡修理工具、传授技术等等形式，直接支援抗旱防涝斗争。尤其是厂社挂钩，这是工业企业支援农业的一项经常的、有效的组织形式，也是密切工人和农民的联系，进一步巩固工农联盟的具体有效的措施，我们更应当坚持下去，并且发展它、加强它。每一个企业在为农业生产和修理机械设备和各种工具时，不论大的，小的，成批的，零星的，产值大的，产值小的，都要积极做好，因为这都是为加强国民经济发展的基础出力，都是为加强和发展工农联盟出力，都是最光荣的事业。不但要做到品种、规格符合需要，而且要做到数量足，质量好，包使用，还要包传授技术。我们要把支援农业作为促进企业生产前进的动力，困难自己留下，方便送给别人的这种共产主义风格，在支援农业中应当大大发扬。
    思想工作是经济工作、业务工作的灵魂和统帅。以农业为基础的思想挂了帅，事事依靠群众，又切切实实地解决具体问题，就一定能在支援农业中做出显著的成绩来。这是为许许多多的事实所一再证明了的。现在被誉为“太行山支援农业一面红旗”的山西省淮海机械厂是其中一个例子。这是抗日战争时期办起来的一个老工厂，它的主要任务并不是制造农业机械，可是全厂在“人人为支援农业办一件或几件好事，个个为支援农业技术改造出力”的口号下，一条心，一股劲，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。从1958年以来，他们除了按照国家计划为人民公社制造锅驼机、水泵、汽轮机、发电机等设备一千多台以外，还将自己增产和节约的一百多台机床、一万多件工具、八十多吨材料，以送、借、卖的方式，支援了十四个县办工业和五十一个公社工厂和电站。他们不但为人民公社培养了近千名技术人才，还组织工程技术人员和工人下乡帮助解决技术问题，组织职工下乡上山修理农具和机器，仅今年上半年，帮助人民公社修配农具的工时就达四万二千八百多个。现在这个厂已同晋中、晋东南、晋北、晋南等专区十二个县的六十个人民公社挂上了钩。淮海机械厂的规模不算大，而支援农业的事迹十分突出，精神十分可佩而令人感动。淮海机械厂不仅是太行山的一面红旗，也是全国的一面红旗。在全国，物质技术条件跟淮海机械厂相当，或者超过它的工厂、矿山不知有多少，如果都像他们那样，人人以支援农业为天职，为己任，那么我们就一定会做出比现在更加辉煌的成绩来，因而也就一定能够加速我国农业现代化的进程！
    工业企业要树立以农业为基础的思想，向淮海机械厂看齐，把工业支援农业、城市支援农村的群众运动推向新的高潮！
