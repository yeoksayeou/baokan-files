Let Explosions Work for Construction
    Yan Huo
    Gunpowder was invented in China during the Tang Dynasty. It was first used in warfare and then gradually applied to production.
    On highway and railway construction sites, people use it to blast mountains and fill valleys, and to dig tunnels...
    In water conservancy projects, people use it to move mountains and dig canals. In recent years, people have created a dam construction method called directional blasting, using the power of gunpowder to build dams instead of manpower to block rivers. Before building the dam, choose a location and bury explosives in pre-designed tunnels according to a certain arrangement, so that the force of the explosion is concentrated in a certain direction. At the touch of a button, the gunpowder explodes in sequence, and the pressure generated by the explosion throws soil or rocks onto the river surface in the direction people specify. In a matter of minutes, explosives help people build earthen or stone dams to block the turbulent rivers. This method is fast, saves labor, and is economical and convenient. Since learning this advanced experience from the Soviet Union, our country is promoting this dam construction method on a large scale in water conservancy projects.
    Explosives can be used in agricultural production to help farmers deep plow the land. This is the result of experiments conducted by some people's communes and scientific research institutions since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Explosive deep plowing not only saves labor and reduces labor intensity—deep plowing to a depth of three feet can save about 80% of labor—but also, because the gunpowder explosion loosens the soil and the products generated after the gunpowder explosion improve the “nutrition” of the soil, the crop yields on explosively deep-plowed land are higher than those on manually deep-plowed land.
    Earthquakes are a natural disaster, but in geological exploration, people often create small-scale artificial earthquakes to explore mineral deposits and measure the structure of the Earth's crust. After the explosives buried underground detonate, they generate seismic waves. When these seismic waves encounter different rock and mineral layers during propagation, they produce different reflected waves. Exploration workers record these reflected waves and, after analysis, can understand the distribution of minerals within the explosion area.
    People also apply explosions to mining and drilling, etc. Even in mechanical processing, there are items that serve people—hardening metal surfaces. People attach explosives to the surface of the workpiece, and the gas waves generated when the explosives detonate impact the surface of the workpiece, hardening it. Although explosion is a technology with a long history, its application in various industrial and agricultural sectors has just begun. Let explosions better serve construction work!

    让爆炸为建设工作
    言火
    火药发明于中国的唐代。最早用于战争，其后逐渐应用到生产中。
    在修筑公路、铁路的工地上，人们用它来开山填壑，凿通隧道……。
    在水利工程建设上，人们用它来移山挖渠。近年来人们创造了一种叫做定向爆破的筑坝方法，利用火药的力量代替人力筑起大坝拦截河水。筑坝之先，选好地点，让炸药按一定的布置，埋设在预先设计好的坑道之中，使爆炸时的力量集中在一定的方向。人们一按电钮，火药有次序地爆炸，爆炸时产生的压力就把土或石块按照人们指定的方向抛到河面上。不消几分钟的时间，炸药就帮助人们筑起了拦截蛟龙的土坝或石坝。这种方法速度快，既节省劳动力，又省钱省事。自从向苏联学习了这个先进经验以后，我国的水利工程建设中，正大规模地推行这种筑坝方法。
    炸药用在农业生产上，可以帮助农民深翻土地。这是1958年大跃进以来，一些人民公社和科学研究机关试验的成果。爆炸深翻土地，不但能节约劳动力和减轻劳动强度，深翻三尺，约能节约劳动力80％；另一方面，由于火药爆炸把土地炸得很松，火药爆炸后的生成物，改善了土壤的“营养”，因此爆炸深翻的土地上的作物收获量，比人工深翻的土地上的收获量要高。
    地震是一种自然灾害，可是在地质勘探中，人们经常制造小规模的人工地震，利用人工地震来测探矿藏和测量地壳的结构。埋在地下的炸药爆炸以后，产生了地震波，地震波在传播过程中，遇到不同的岩石层和矿物层，就会产生不同的反射波。勘探工作者把这些反射波记录下来，经过分析就能了解在爆炸区域内矿物的分布情况。
    人们还将爆炸应用于采矿和钻探等部门。甚至在机械加工方面，也出现了它为人们服务的项目——硬化金属表面。人们将炸药贴在工件的表面，炸药爆炸时产生的气波，就会对工件表面冲击，使工件表面硬化。爆炸虽是一门历史悠久的技
    术，然而它在工农业各部门中的应用还刚刚开端。让爆炸更好地为建设工作吧！
