Supporting Agriculture: A Short Story

　　Wastewater Transformed into Fertilizer
　　Huang Fasen

　　A team of twenty-odd people was slowly proceeding from the suburbs towards the city center. Some were pushing carts, others were carrying manure buckets. Red paper flags with the words "Fertilizer Delivery Vehicle" written on them fluttered in the wind on the carts. People could tell at a glance that these workers were returning from delivering fertilizer to the suburban communes.
　　The team entered the printing and dyeing factory, and family members rushed up to ask all sorts of questions. Some replied that they had done another good deed for the countryside on this Sunday, exceeding their fertilizer delivery quota. Others said that the countryside needed a lot of fertilizer and that they would have to deliver it several more times! Technician Xiao Zhang, who carried the most and ran the fastest, was unhappy for some reason upon returning. She said, "I spent most of the day, and only carried thirty or forty loads of fertilizer. I'm exhausted!" She paused for a moment and then said to everyone, "Can we find a way to deliver fertilizer that is faster, more plentiful, and easier?" The Party branch secretary took this opportunity to speak to everyone: "Comrades! Many of us are from the countryside and understand that more fertilizer means more grain!" He looked at Xiao Zhang and continued, "Xiao Zhang's idea is worth discussing. Supporting agriculture in a way that is plentiful, fast, and easy is a big deal..."
　　The secretary was in the middle of his speech when a worker rushed in, out of breath, shouting, "The sanitation committee member is here! The sanitation committee member is here!" At this moment, all the talking stopped. They saw Sanitation Committee Member Aunt Xu following closely behind. As soon as she arrived, she said:
　　"Party Branch Secretary, Xiao Zhang (Xiao Zhang is the factory's sanitation committee member), tell me again, when are you finally moving? You've caused us to lose the sanitation red flag again!" Seeing Aunt Xu's anxious state, the secretary asked her to sit down while explaining that he would come up with a solution within a week. Before Aunt Xu could be persuaded to leave, Wang Dadi from the fish farm arrived, shouting as soon as he saw the secretary, "My good secretary, if you don't come up with a solution, your factory's medicinal water (industrial wastewater) will poison all the fish in my pond!"
　　The printing and dyeing factory was advanced in all its work, especially in supporting agriculture. They regularly sent fertilizer to the countryside, provided labor during spring plowing and summer harvesting, and were therefore praised and loved by the farmers. They also helped the street-run industries, and the residents were happy with them. However, one thing annoyed them: the washing and dyeing workshop discharged a large amount of wastewater every day. The drains couldn't handle it, causing it to overflow, smelling bad and breeding mosquitoes and flies. Most of it flowed into the fish ponds, killing the fish. Aunt Xu and Wang Dadi had negotiated many times, and the factory promised to solve the problem, but couldn't think of a solution. Therefore, the street sanitation committee decided to issue an eviction notice: they had to move. But where to move to? This was a huge problem.
　　After persuading Aunt Xu and Wang Dadi to leave, the factory convened a general meeting to ask everyone to come up with ideas and solutions. Xiao Zhang had been very quiet these past few days. Some said it was because she was carrying fertilizer on Sunday and her shoulder was hurt by the carrying pole, others said she was extremely upset that others wanted the factory to move, as she was the sanitation committee member. Xiao Zhang had indeed been preoccupied with something these past few days. She spoke less, often flipped through books, and occasionally talked with the secretary and several veteran workers. It seemed like she was researching something. At night, in the quiet, Xiao Zhang used a medicine bottle to scoop up wastewater, sat at her desk, reading, flipping through books, and writing. Suddenly, a dark shadow appeared behind her, and the shadow reached out and gently tapped her on the back, saying, "Xiao Zhang! Work and rest should be combined! It's time to rest." Xiao Zhang was lost in thought, and was startled when she heard someone call her. Turning around, she saw it was the secretary. She immediately told the secretary about the information she had found on using wastewater to extract high-grade chemical fertilizer. The secretary sat down and studied the results with her, believing it made sense and supporting her in immediately conducting an experiment.
　　After work, a group of young people surrounded the secretary and Xiao Zhang, singing and joking. Some passed bricks, some mixed mud, some built a stove, some scooped wastewater. After several consecutive nights of hard work, they finally successfully experimented with making indigenous fertilizer. After testing, one jin of fertilizer could be mixed with a large amount of water to be used as fertilizer. They were still not satisfied, and conducted experiments in their own vegetable gardens. The lettuce that had been fertilized grew half an inch taller in just three or four days compared to the unfertilized ones. The workers happily said, "With this, we don't have to hurt our shoulders and backs when 'visiting relatives' (delivering fertilizer to the countryside) anymore, just carrying a couple of jin will be enough."
　　A few days later, outside the back gate of the printing and dyeing factory, it was lively. People lined up in a long queue. Some carried buckets, some carried small containers, some carried washbasins, here to collect wastewater. Young Pioneers wearing red scarves came, old aunties came, and there were also workers. Wasn't that Sanitation Committee Member Aunt Xu? She was also in the queue collecting wastewater. Xiao Zhang was quick-witted and went up to help Aunt Xu collect wastewater, saying with a smile, "Aunt Xu, we were planning to move! You'll have to walk a few more li in the future to collect wastewater!" Saying this made Aunt Xu embarrassed: "Oh! You little girl are still getting revenge, who knew this wastewater could be used as fertilizer?" Aunt Xu picked up the wastewater and said:
　　"The neighborhood committee won't ask you to move anymore!" On Aunt Xu's way back, Wang Dadi from the fish farm also carried a bucket and rushed over, and the mischievous Xiao Jin blocked Dadi from leaving: "Uncle! Tell me, are you here to ask our secretary to compensate you for the fish!"
　　"You little rascal, do you think you can be mischievous now that you have this 'treasure' water! Uncle is here to support agriculture." Wang Dadi's words made Xiao Jin laugh non-stop. Dadi told him that the Party committee had a meeting yesterday, and everyone came to make fertilizer to support agriculture, so he and his neighbors, the old men and old aunties, also built stoves and refined indigenous fertilizer.

　　废水变化肥
　　黄发森
    一个二十多人的队伍，从郊区向市区缓缓地行进着。有的推着小车，有的担着粪桶，写着“送肥车”三个字的红纸小旗，在车上迎风飞舞。人们一看就知道这是工人为郊区公社送肥回来了。
    队伍进入了印染厂，家里的人纷纷拥上来问这问那。有的回答说，今天这个星期天，又为农村做了一件好事，送肥任务超了额。有的说，农村要的肥料就是多，要多送几次才行！技术员小张，挑的多、跑的快，不知啥原因，回来后反而不高兴。她说：“去了大半天，才挑了三、四十挑肥，人还累得够呛呢！”她稍停了一下又对大伙说：“能不能找个又快又多又轻松的办法送肥呢？”支部书记借着这由头对大家讲开了：“同志们！我们很多人都是农村来的，都懂得只有肥多，粮食才多！”他的眼光扫向小张又继续讲：“小张的想法，值得讨论，又多又快又轻松地支援农业，是件大事……”
    书记正讲到半中腰，一个工人气呼呼地跑进来，边跑边喊：“卫生委员来了！卫生委员来了。”这时讲话声全没有了。只见卫生委员许姨妈紧跟在后面，一见面就说：
  “支部书记、小张（小张是厂的卫生委员）你俩再说说，你们究竟几时搬家呀！闹得我们这一片的卫生红旗，又被别人夺走了。”看到许姨妈这般气急法，书记一边让许姨妈坐，一边解释，答应在一个星期内想出办法。许姨妈还没劝说走，养鱼场王大爹又来了，一见书记就喊：“我的好书记，你再不想办法，你们厂的药水（工业废水），把我池塘里的鱼都要毒光了！”
    印染厂一切工作都先进，尤其在支援农业上，更为出色，定期给农村送肥，春耕夏收支援劳力，因此，受到农民表扬和热爱。他们还帮助街道办工业，居民也欢喜他们。就是一桩事使他们恼火：洗染车间每天流出大量废水，水沟流不及，泛滥成灾，臭气难闻，蚊蝇孳生。大部分流到鱼塘里，鱼也遭了殃。许姨妈、王大爹多次来交涉，厂里答应解决，但就是想不出办法。于是，街道卫生委员会，决定下逐客令：要他们搬家。要搬家，搬到哪里去呢？这是天大的难题。
    把许姨妈、王大爹劝走以后，厂里召开了大会，要大家出计谋、想办法。小张这几天来，沉默得很。有的说她是星期天送肥被扁担压坏了，有的说是别人要厂搬家，她这个卫生委员气极了。小张这几天心里的确像有什么心事。说话少了，常翻书，时不时的和书记、几个老工人谈论。像是在研究什么。夜，静静的，小张用药瓶舀来废水，坐在桌前，一边看，一边翻书，一边写。忽然背后出现了一个黑影，黑影伸出了手，轻轻的在她背上敲了两下，说：“小张！劳逸要结合嘛！该休息去了。”小张正想得出神，猛一听到喊她，吃了一惊。回头看，见是书记。她马上把用废水能提炼高级化学肥料的资料，告诉了书记。书记坐下来和她研究的结果，认为有道理，支持她马上试验。
    下班了，一群小伙子围着书记和小张，唱着闹着。递砖头的递砖头，拌泥巴的拌泥巴，有的打炉子，有的舀废水，连续干几个夜晚终于试验成功了土化肥。经过化验，一斤化肥能对上大量的水作肥料。他们还不放心，又在自己的菜地里作了试验，上了化肥的莴笋比没上的，只三、四天时间，就高出了半寸。工人们高兴的说：“有了它，再‘走亲戚’（为农村送肥）就不要磨肩背皮，提上两斤就够了。”
    几天后，印染厂后门外，好不热闹。人群排起一条长龙。有的提着水桶，有的提着小吊，有的端起脸盆，在这里打废水。带着红领巾的少先队员来了，老姨妈来了，还有工人。那不是卫生委员许姨妈吗？她也杂在队伍里挑废水来了。小张眼尖，迎上去，一边帮许姨妈打废水，一边笑呵呵地说：“许姨妈，我们打算搬家咧！您以后挑废水可要多走几里路呀！”这一说，把个许姨妈说得不好意思起来：“哟！小丫头还报复呢，哪个晓得这废水还能做肥料？”许姨妈挑起废水说：
  “居委会再不要你们搬家了！”在那许姨妈回去的路上，鱼场王大爹也担起水桶赶来了，调皮的小金挡住大爹不让走：“大爹！告诉我是不是找我们书记赔鱼来的！”
  “小调皮，你们有了这‘宝’水，就放刁了吗！大爹是为支援农业来的。”王大爹一席话，把个小金讲得大笑不止。大爹告诉他，昨天党委开了会，大家都来造化肥支援农业，所以他和邻居的老汉们、老姨妈们也一起打炉子、炼土化肥了。
