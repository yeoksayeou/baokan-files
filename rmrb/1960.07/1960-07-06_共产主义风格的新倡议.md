    New Initiatives in the Communist Style
    By Our Correspondent Ge Baozhi
    1 + 2 = ? What a simple arithmetic problem, even a first-grade elementary school student can answer it correctly. However, we are not talking about an ordinary arithmetic problem here, but a new initiative with a communist style.
    The "1+2" initiative was proposed by Besnik Shaqiri, an electrical worker at the "December 21" Construction Company in Tirana, the capital of Albania. "1+2" means: a skilled technical worker is responsible for training two apprentices without pay.
    We recently visited the initiator of the "1+2" movement. When we went to the "December 21" Construction Company, we saw new projects being built everywhere along the way, including the Tirana Palace of Culture, which had just broken ground, four- and five-story residential buildings, and the Tirana Food Complex, which was about to go into production... All the construction sites were bustling with activity. Tall cranes stood like giants in the center of the building complexes, their huge arms lifting bundles of steel bars and whole cement slabs high into the air, the large mouths of cement mixers continuously spewing out bucket after bucket of concrete, workers working at high altitudes were busy erecting steel beams, and painters were putting the finishing touches on the soon-to-be-completed residences. In this symphony of labor sounds, we met Comrade Shaqiri, who greeted us warmly with a handshake, and we talked like old friends.
    Shaqiri is only in his thirties this year, but he has already worked for more than twenty years. He started learning electrical work at the age of fifteen. Because of his love for his work and his eagerness to learn, he not only mastered electrical technology, but also improved his education through his work. He has honorably become a member of the Labor Party. He has participated in the construction of almost all of Albania's major socialist projects, so he proudly told us: "I have grown up with the country's emerging industry, and the beloved Party has given us infinite strength."
    Shaqiri started by talking about the "1+2" initiative. Last November, when workers throughout Albania were creating new achievements to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the country's liberation, Shaqiri also joined the ranks of dedicating gifts to the motherland, working selflessly. But when it came time to rest, a series of new questions made him unable to calm down: How can I help others more? Through what way can skilled workers be trained faster? He once thought that going to work earlier and leaving work later, with a little extra effort in between, wouldn't that be faster and better? But this was not a long-term solution, it would not be possible to do this regularly. He also thought of the method of taking on more apprentices. Last year, Shaqiri was responsible for training more than a dozen workers, and he tirelessly helped them, but one person's energy is limited after all, helping this one means neglecting that one, and although he was busy all day long, it was difficult to take care of all the apprentices, let alone provide comprehensive and specific help.
    After repeated thinking and consideration, Shaqiri, with the help of the Party and Youth League organizations, finally came up with the "1+2" method, which is that a seventh-grade skilled technician is responsible for training two sixth-grade technicians, and the two sixth-grade technicians are then responsible for training four fifth-grade technicians. In this way, the upper level helps the lower level, and the help is passed down to the third-grade technicians. Because one passes on to two, and two passes on to four, the more workers who are trained, the more each worker becomes both a student and a teacher, which changes the situation in the past where only seventh-grade technicians could take on apprentices, and also solves the difficulty of insufficient masters. Because of the division of labor and responsibility, and step-by-step training, it is also possible to provide individual instruction and in-depth guidance. The new initiative has increased the sense of responsibility of every worker. The new initiative has combined teaching and practice, and has also accelerated the growth of the skilled workers.
    What is even more valuable in this new initiative is helping others without pay, which is a noble communist style. Shaqiri excitedly told us: "I have worked for twenty years, and the contrast between before and after liberation is the most vivid education for me. In the past, people regarded technology as personal private property and were unwilling to easily pass it on to others, but today, when we have become masters of the country, when the beloved Party is leading us towards a bright future, what does one person's gain or loss matter!" At this time, one of Shaqiri's apprentices, a nineteen-year-old young electrical worker named Selemen Faya, interjected and said: "When the motherland needs more skilled workers and needs to save more funds for socialist construction, helping others without pay is exactly what we should do." They calculated with their fingers and told us that since the "1+2" movement was launched, the "December 21" Construction Company alone has saved the country more than 1.2 million lek (Albanian currency). When we asked Faya to talk about how he helps others, Faya modestly said: "I don't understand enough, and I can't talk about helping others more, but with Shaqiri's help, I quickly learned more than a dozen new operating techniques. I clearly understand that if others help me selflessly, I should pass on the technology that others taught me to others without reservation."
    Faya told us with a kind of recollection that the proposal of Shaqiri's suggestion was not smooth sailing. Some old-fashioned people were scolding him behind his back as a "fool," but Shaqiri did not care about this. In his work, he strictly demanded every apprentice, and he himself was very serious about every process and every operation. He patiently and tirelessly demonstrated the movements to the apprentices. He was also so easy to approach, so after work he and the apprentices became the closest of friends, taking walks together and entertaining themselves together. Shaqiri also often encouraged his two apprentices to make progress. Currently, Faya is studying in a vocational school. There are more than 700 people like Faya, who are both apprentices and masters, in this construction company alone. They have all signed contracts for guaranteed teaching and learning, and strive to greatly improve their skills within a year.
    After the "1+2" initiative was proposed, it immediately received great attention and support from the Albanian Labor Party and the trade union. The Central Committee of the Labor Party has specially made a resolution, instructing Party committees and trade union organizations at all levels across the country to actively promote this movement. Up to now, more than 8,000 people across Albania have responded to this advanced initiative of not counting remuneration, and it has been extended from the construction department to all factories, mines, and enterprises across the country, which has made production appear in a new light. Taking the "December 21" Construction Company as an example, in the past, some workers always failed to complete the plan every quarter, but after the promotion of the "1+2" initiative, although this year's production tasks have been greatly increased compared to last year, due to the strengthening of the sense of responsibility of workers at all levels and the continuous improvement of technical level, the company exceeded its production plan for the first four months of this year with a score of 105%.
    When we said goodbye, Shaqiri asked us to convey their greetings to the Chinese workers, and once again said: "We must not only help others regardless of personal gains and losses, but also treat learning with a socialist labor attitude, strive to improve our theory and master advanced technology, in order to become a skilled worker who is proficient in a variety of technologies."

### 共产主义风格的新倡议

    共产主义风格的新倡议
    本报记者　戈宝植
    1＋2＝？这是多么简单的一道算术题，连一年级的小学生也会对答无误的。可是，这里谈的并不是一道普通的算术题，而是一个具有共产主义风格的新倡议。
    “1＋2”的倡议是阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那“12月21日”建筑公司的电气工人贝斯尼克·沙契里提出的。“1＋2”的意思是：一个熟练的技术工人不计报酬地负责培养两个徒弟。
    最近我们访问了“1＋2”运动的倡议者。当我们前往“12月21日”建筑公司去访问的时候，沿途到处都是兴建着的新工程，其中有刚刚破土开工的地拉那文化宫，有四、五层的居民住宅大楼，也有即将投入生产的地拉那食品联合工厂……，所有的工地上都是一片沸腾的景象。高大的起重机像巨人似的耸立在建筑群的中央，它那巨大的手臂把成捆的钢筋、整块的水泥板高高地吊起，水泥搅拌机的大嘴不断地吐出一桶又一桶的混凝土，高空作业的工人们正在紧张地架设钢梁，而油漆工人们则为即将完工的住宅作最后的粉饰。就在这一首交织着各种声响的劳动进行曲中，我们会见了沙契里同志，他极为热情地跟我们握手、问好，我们很快地就像老朋友似地谈了起来。
    沙契里今年才三十多岁，但他已经有了二十多年的工龄。从十五岁起，他就开始学习电工。由于热爱自己的工作和虚心学习，他不仅掌握了电工技术，并且在工作中提高了文化。他已光荣地成了劳动党员。他几乎参加了阿尔巴尼亚所有的社会主义大工程的建设，所以他自豪地对我们说：“我是和祖国的新生工业同时成长起来的，亲爱的党给了我们无穷的力量”。
    沙契里一开始就谈到了“1＋2”的倡议。去年11月，当全阿尔巴尼亚的工人都在以创造新的成就迎接祖国解放十五周年的时候，沙契里也不例外地加入了向祖国献礼的行列，他忘我地进行劳动。但一到休息的时候，就有一连串的新问题使他不能平静下来：怎样才能更多地帮助别人呢？通过什么方式才能更快地培养熟练工人呢？他曾想到，早一点上班迟一点下班，中间再加一把油，不就能快能好了吗？但是这不是长远之计，要经常的这样做那是不行的。他又想到了多带徒弟的办法。去年，沙契里负责培养十多个工人，他不倦地帮助他们，可是一个人的精力毕竟有限，帮了这个，就丢了那个，虽然整天不停地忙碌着，但也很难照顾到所有的学徒，更难做到全面具体的帮助。
    沙契里经过反复的思索考虑，最后在党和青年团组织的帮助下，终于想出了“1＋2”的办法，这就是一个七级的熟练技工负责培养两个六级技工，而两个六级技工再去负责培养四个五级技工。这样，上一级帮助下一级，递次地一直帮助到三级技工，由于一个传两个，两个传四个，愈向下传，受培养的工人就愈多，每一个工人既成了学生，又做了先生，这就改变了过去只有七级技工才能带徒弟的情况，同时也解决了师傅不足的困难。由于分工负责，逐级培养，也就能够做到个别传授和深入指导了。新倡议使每一个工人都增加了责任感。新倡议使教学和实践结合了起来，也加速了熟练工人队伍的成长。
    这个新的倡议中更为可贵的，是不计报酬地帮助别人，这是一种崇高的共产主义风格。沙契里激动地对我们说：“我已工作了二十年，解放前后的对比，对我是一个最鲜明的教育，过去的人把技术看成为个人的私有财产，不肯轻易传授给别人，但是，今天当我们成了国家的主人的时候，当亲爱的党正领导我们走向美好的将来的时候，一个人的得失还算得了什么！”这时，沙契里的一位徒弟、十九岁的青年电气工人塞勒门·法亚插进来说：“正当祖国需要更多的熟练工人，需要节约出更多的资金用来建设社会主义的时候，不计报酬帮助别人，正是我们应该做的。”他们用手盘算了一下告诉我们，自从“1＋2”运动开展以来，单单“12月21日”建筑公司就已为国家节约了一百二十多万里克（阿币）。当我们请法亚谈一谈他是怎样去帮助别人的时候，法亚却谦虚地说：“我懂得还少，还谈不上更多地去帮助别人，但是在沙契里的帮助下，我很快地就学会了十几种新的操作技术。我清楚地懂得，别人无私地帮助我，我更应无保留地把别人教给我的技术传给别人。”
    法亚带着一种回忆的神色告诉我们，沙契里这个建议的提出并不是一帆风顺的。一些旧脑筋的人都在背后骂他是“傻瓜”，但沙契里并不计较这些。工作中，他严格地要求每一个徒工，他本人对每一个工序、每一项操作都非常认真。他循循善诱地毫不厌烦地给徒工们做出示范动作。他又是那样地容易使人接近，因此下班以后他和徒工们成了最亲密的朋友，一起散步，一起娱乐。沙契里并且经常鼓励他的两个徒工进步。目前，法亚正在技工进修班学习。像法亚这样的既是徒弟又是师傅的人，单在这个建筑公司内就有七百多人。他们彼此都签订了包教保学的合同，争取要在一年内把技术大大提高一步。
    “1＋2”的倡议提出以后，立即受到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和工会的极大重视和支持。劳动党中央委员会曾专门作出决议，指示全国各级党委和工会组织应积极地推广这一运动。到目前为止，全阿尔巴尼亚响应这一不计报酬的先进倡议的已达八千多人，并且从建筑部门推广到了全国所有工矿、企业，它使生产出现了新的面貌。以“12月21日”建筑公司为例，过去每一季度总有一些工人完成不了计划，而在推广了
  “1＋2”的倡议以后，虽然今年的生产任务比去年大大加重了，但由于各级工人的责任心的加强和技术水平的不断提高，公司以105％的成绩超额完成了今年头四个月的生产计划。
    在我们告别的时候，沙契里要我们向中国工人转达他们的问候，并再一次表示：“我们不仅要不计个人得失地去帮助别人，并且还要以社会主义的劳动态度来对待学习，努力地提高理论和掌握先进技术，以成为一个精通多种技术的熟练工人。”
