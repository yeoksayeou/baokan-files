Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Public opinion in various countries is warmly supporting the Cuban government's resolute measures in taking over American, British, and other countries' oil companies as a counterattack against imperialist economic aggression.

The Rio de Janeiro Student Union's newspaper, "Jornal do Commercio," published an editorial saying: Cuban Prime Minister Castro's takeover of foreign oil companies is a resolute and courageous act. The editorial pointed out that Latin America's underdevelopment is directly related to American imperialism, and therefore it is necessary to struggle against imperialism and defeat it.

The editorial said that this is a critical moment for the people and students of Latin American countries. Cuba will face tremendous pressure being exerted upon it, and therefore a victory in overcoming this pressure will be everyone's victory, not just the Cubans' victory. "Jornal do Commercio" concluded by saying: We must be more vigilant than ever before.

Mexican newspapers have also published commentaries supporting the Cuban government's takeover of foreign oil companies and condemning the imperialist conspiracies to interfere in Cuba. The Mexican "El Universal" pointed out that just as when Mexico took over foreign oil companies, the imperialist oil monopoly groups are launching a movement to force the Cuban government to submit. "Ultimas Noticias" condemned the slander against Castro due to the Cuban government's takeover of foreign oil companies, and pointed out that the same defamation and slander were suffered when Mexico confiscated foreign oil companies.

Robert Williams, the American black leader and chairman of the American "Committee to Resist Racial Discrimination," who is currently visiting Cuba, said regarding the Cuban government's takeover of the Texaco, Esso, and Shell imperialist oil companies that this action by the Cuban revolutionary government means another severing of the economic shackles suffered by Cuba, and Cuba has taken another step in freeing itself from imperialism. He pointed out that the measures taken by the Cuban government against these three oil companies for violating Cuban law have no impact on ordinary Americans, because these companies are controlled by wealthy Americans. Williams also condemned these companies for practicing racial discrimination.

The British "Daily Worker" published an editorial on July 1st entitled "Hands Off Cuba," condemning the American conspiracy to launch an armed attack on Cuba.

The editorial wrote: "Mounting evidence suggests that the United States is planning to attack Cuba. The BBC correspondent in Washington reports that there is a strong feeling that 'the United States will definitely do something soon.'"

The editorial, in discussing the Cuban government's takeover of an American oil company in Cuba that refused to abide by Cuban law, wrote: Cuba, which is fighting for independence with great courage, demands the right to decide what oil it will produce on its own territory. But the oil monopolists believe they dominate the world and refuse to recognize this right of Cuba.

The editorial pointed out: "When Nasser took over the Suez Canal, the British and French oil groups were the backers of the aggression against Egypt. Now, the American and British oil groups are stirring up trouble and trying everything possible to defeat Cuba. Cuba is being portrayed as a Soviet communist base only ninety miles from the United States. This is a trick used to deceive the public. What the United States is really worried about is that an independent and prosperous Cuba will become a model for Latin American countries to emulate."

It pointed out that America's practice of armed subversion of Latin American countries is well known. Only six years ago, the United States invaded Guatemala.

The "Daily Worker" finally emphasized: "The labor and peace-loving people of Britain should rise up and demand 'Hands Off Cuba.'"

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published a commentary saying that the more American imperialism intensifies its sabotage activities against Cuba, the more resolutely the Cuban people will oppose it, and the further the Cuban revolution will advance.

The commentary said that the Cuban government's recent action of taking over the facilities of the American Texaco Oil Company in Cuba shows that in the cause of defending and developing the fruits of the revolution, no amount of banditry or pressure can weaken the Cuban people's fighting will.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people and the people of the world strongly condemn the despicable activities carried out by American imperialism against the Cuban people and resolutely support the Cuban revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: According to TASS, Mexico City, July 3rd: Mexican university students held a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Mexico City to protest against American interference in Cuba's internal affairs and to express their support for the Cuban people. The placards held by the demonstrators read: "Cuba is not alone," "Yes to Cuba, No to Yankees."

    各国公众舆论支持古巴接管外国石油公司
    呼吁挫败美国干涉古巴的阴谋
    墨西哥大学生在美国大使馆前示威声援古巴人民斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论热烈支持古巴政府为反击帝国主义经济侵略而采取的接管美英等国石油公司的坚决措施。
    里约热内卢学生联合会的机关报“都市报”发表社论说：古巴总理卡斯特罗接管外国石油公司，是坚决而勇敢的做法。社论指出，拉丁美洲的不发达状态和美帝国主义有直接的连带关系，因此必须同帝国主义作斗争而挫败它。
    社论说，对拉丁美洲各国人民和各国学生来说，现在是严重的时刻。古巴将面临向它施加的巨大压力，因此压倒这种压力的胜利，将是大家的胜利而不仅仅是古巴人的胜利。“都市报”最后说：我们必须比以往任何时候更加提高警惕。
    墨西哥报纸也纷纷发表评论，支持古巴政府对外国石油公司的接管，并且谴责帝国主义干涉古巴的阴谋活动。墨西哥“欢呼报”指出，正像墨西哥在接管外国石油公司时一样，帝国主义石油垄断集团正在展开一个企图使古巴政府屈服的运动。“最后消息报”谴责由于古巴政府接管外国石油公司而对卡斯特罗进行的诬蔑，并指出当墨西哥没收外国石油公司时也曾遭到过同样的诽谤和诬蔑。
    正在古巴访问的美国黑人领袖、美国“反对种族不公平委员会”主席罗伯特·威廉斯，就古巴政府接管德士古、埃索和壳牌三家帝国主义石油公司发表谈话说，古巴革命政府的这一行动意味着又一次斩断了古巴所遭受的经济束缚，古巴在摆脱帝国主义方面又迈进了一步。他指出，古巴政府由于这三家石油公司违背古巴法律而采取的措施，对普通的美国人毫无影响，因为这些公司是由美国的富人所控制的。威廉斯还谴责这几家公司实行种族歧视。
    英国“工人日报”1日以“不准触碰古巴”为题发表社论，谴责美国阴谋对古巴发动武装进攻。
    社论写道：“越来越多的迹象表明美国打算进攻古巴。英国广播公司驻华盛顿记者报道，人们强烈地感觉到，‘美国不久一定将有所动作’。”
    社论在谈到古巴政府接管一家拒绝遵守古巴法律的设在古巴的美国石油公司这件事时写道：以莫大的勇气为独立而斗争的古巴，要求享有决定要在自己的领土上生产什么石油的权利。但是石油垄断资本家认为他们主宰着世界，不肯承认古巴这种权利。
    社论指出：“当纳赛尔接管苏伊士运河的时候，英法石油集团是对埃及发动侵略的后台老板，现在，美、英石油集团正在兴风作浪，想尽办法要击溃古巴。古巴被说成是苏联在距美国只有九十英里的共产主义基地。这就是用来欺骗公众的把戏。美国真正担心的是一个独立繁荣的古巴，将成为拉丁美洲国家效法的典范。”
    它指出，美国武装颠复拉丁美洲国家的做法是尽人皆知的。只在六年前，美国就对危地马拉进行了侵略。
    “工人日报”最后强调说：“英国的劳工和爱好和平的人民应该起来要求‘不准侵犯古巴’。”
    越南“人民报”发表评论说，美帝国主义越是加强它对古巴的破坏活动，古巴人民就将越坚决地反对它，古巴的革命就将越向前发展。
    评论说，古巴政府最近接管美国德士古石油公司在古巴的设施的行动表明，在保卫和发展革命成果的事业中，没有任何一种强盗行径和任何压力能够削弱古巴人民的斗争意志。
    评论最后说，越南人民和世界人民强烈谴责美帝国主义对古巴人民所进行的卑鄙活动，坚决支持古巴的革命。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城3日讯：墨西哥大学生在美国驻墨西哥大使馆的门前举行了示威，抗议美国干涉古巴内政和对古巴人民表示声援。在示威者手执的标语牌上写道：“古巴不是孤独的”，“要古巴，不要美国佬”。
