This newspaper, Zhengzhou, July 1st: Under the guidance of the thought of "guaranteeing iron with ore," the mine factory affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in Henan Province has promoted meticulous work style and vigorously grasped the technical transformation of the mine, making ore production flourish and exceeding monthly production plans. In the first quarter of this year, the plant's ore production increased by 99.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The average daily output in May increased by 22.3% compared to April, and the average daily output from June 1st to 20th increased by 75.2% compared to the same period in May. It also exceeded half of the annual national plan by 0.43% fourteen days ahead of schedule.

	Work ahead, not behind; grasp early, grasp fiercely, grasp in detail
	Grasping "early" for advance preparation, grasping "fiercely" to achieve plans, and grasping "detailed" for good problem solving are among the important reasons why the mine factory has achieved continuous leaps in production. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has started arranging the plan for the next month in the middle of each month. First, the Party Committee is convened to analyze and study the production situation of the month, discuss the guiding ideology for the next step, clarify the current production key and the main links to be grasped next month, and put forward combat slogans. Before the 23rd, the operation plan for the next month is issued to each production unit, and the workers are mobilized to discuss, and measures are formulated and guarantees are made at all levels, so that the plan is implemented to each production team, group, class, and individual as soon as possible. When implementing the plan, they adopted the method of vigorously grasping the "good start" at the beginning of the month, grasping production fiercely in the middle of the month, and striving to complete 70% to 80% of the monthly plan. In the last ten days of the month, they grasped both overproduction and preparations for the next month's production. And it has been done at all levels to grasp the plan and grasp the completion situation. The factory and the mining area grasp the plan execution situation once a day, the production team grasps it once every shift, and the group announces the production progress every two hours. In this way, the factory, mining area, team, and group know how much the plan has been completed at any time, so as to find out the problems in production in time and solve them as soon as possible. Thus, it promotes the continuous rise of production wave after wave.

	Monthly formulation of innovation plans, concentration of forces to attack key points
	The technical innovation and technical revolution movement of this factory always pays attention to starting from production needs and closely revolves around the key to production. They formulate innovation plans on a monthly basis, determine the main attack targets, concentrate superior forces, encircle and suppress key points, and mobilize workers to engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization in the four major links of drilling, blasting, loading, and transportation. Because the goals are clear and the forces are concentrated, the effect is significant, and labor productivity is greatly improved. At the beginning of this year, due to the shallow drilling and the small amount of ore blasting, it was far from meeting the needs of production. According to this situation, the factory's Party Committee vigorously grasped large-scale blasting, and focused on testing advanced technologies such as directional blasting and three-line blasting in the third team of the Lizhen mining area, blasting more than 9,000 tons of ore at a time. After the success of this test, it was organized and promoted in a timely manner, and vigorously promoted large hole drilling and deep hole drilling, which greatly increased the amount of ore mining. After the substantial increase in ore mining, in order to make loading and transportation quickly keep up with the requirements of mining, the workers put forward the heroic slogan of "asking the slope for power and asking innovation for labor." Many workers worked hard and cleverly, transforming the roadbed of the transportation track into a slope shape, so that 49 transportation lines in the whole factory universally realized the automatic sliding of mine cars.

	Through vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, the technical appearance of the mine has undergone great changes. On the vast mine, the phenomenon of shoulder carrying, manual lifting, and handcarts can no longer be seen.

	Cadres go deep into the front line, discover big problems from small places
	In order to strengthen the specific leadership of production and organize the continuous leap in production, the leading cadres of this factory often go deep into the front line of production, specifically lead production, and constantly discover and overcome weak links. Since the beginning of this year, nearly one-tenth of the cadres have been drawn out every month to implement rotation and decentralization of labor, and at the same time, a work group headed by the responsible cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League has been organized to participate in production in teams and groups, and to lead production; the cadres who went deep into production eat, live, work, discuss, and innovate with the workers, and implemented five packages - ideological, production, innovation, safety, and life. Many cadres actively helped the team and group cadres to make suggestions, think of ways, and improve leadership methods in production. As a result, many problems have been solved on the spot, which has promoted production. Of the 37 innovations in the Lizhen mining area in May, 28 were jointly realized by cadres and the masses. After Comrade Lu Dongcheng, deputy secretary of the factory's Party Committee, and the work group went deep into the third production team of the Lizhen mining area, they found that there were three highs and three lows in production, that is, the output of the day shift was high, and the output of the night shift was low; the output of the morning shift in the day shift was low, and the output of the afternoon shift was high; the output of the night shift was high in the first half of the night, and the output of the second half of the night was low. After the work group cadres worked around the clock, they found that the food for the night shift was not good, so some workers felt tired in the second half of the night, and the work efficiency decreased accordingly, and the production preparation for the next shift was also poor, so the day shift had to spend about half an hour to clean up the site as soon as they went to work, which affected the output of the morning shift. At the same time, the cadres responsible for night shift duty were also nominal and relaxed their leadership over production. According to this situation, the factory's Party Committee made a special study, on the one hand, established a duty captain to strengthen the leadership of night shift production, on the other hand, vigorously grasped life, and took measures to ensure that night shift workers had a good rest, ate and drank well, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses, and made the night shift work efficiency greatly exceeded the day shift, promoting the forward development of production one shift after another.

    抓“早”提前准备　抓“狠”实现计划　抓“细”问题解决得好
    安阳钢铁厂矿石生产月月超额
    本报郑州1日电　河南省安阳钢铁厂所属矿山厂，在“以矿保铁”的思想指导下，发扬细致的工作作风大抓矿山技术改造，使矿石生产蒸蒸日上，月月超额完成生产计划。今年第一季度，这个厂的矿石产量比去年四季度提高了99.5％。5月份的平均日产量比4月份提高了22.3％，6月1日—20日平均日产量又比5月同期提高75.2％。并提前十四天超额0.43％完成了全年国家计划的一半。
    工作赶前不赶后，抓早抓狠抓得细
    抓“早”字提前准备，抓“狠”字实现计划，抓“细”字问题解决得好，是矿山厂取得生产持续跃进的重要原因之一。今年以来，这个厂每月中旬就开始安排下月计划，首先召开党委会分析、研究本月生产情况和讨论下一步指导思想，明确当前的生产关键和下月抓的主要环节，以及提出战斗口号等。在23日以前就把下月的作业计划下达到各生产单位，发动工人群众讨论，层层订措施，提保证，使计划及早落实到各个生产队、组、班和个人。在执行计划时，他们采取月初大抓开门红，中旬狠抓生产，力争完成月计划的70％—80％，下旬一手抓超产，一手抓下月生产准备。并且作到了层层抓计划，抓完成情况，厂和矿区每天抓一次计划执行情况，生产队每班抓一次，小组每两小时公布一次生产进度。这样就使厂、矿区、队、组随时知道计划完成多少，便于及时发现生产中的问题，及早解决。从而推动生产一浪高一浪地持续上升。
    月月制订革新规划，集中兵力攻关键
    这个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，始终注意从生产需要出发，紧密围绕生产关键进行。他们分月制订革新规划，确定主攻目标，集中优势兵力，围攻重点关键，并发动职工围绕打眼、爆破、装车、运输等四大环节大搞机械化、半机械化。由于目标明确、力量集中，因而效果显著，劳动生产率大大提高。今年年初，由于打眼较浅、矿石爆破量很少，远远不能满足生产需要，厂党委根据这种情况，大抓大炮爆破，并在李珍矿区第三队重点试验定向爆破、三条线爆破等先进技术，一次最多爆破矿石达九千多吨。这一试验成功后，及时组织推广，大力推行打大眼、打深眼，使矿石开采量大大提高。矿石开采量大幅度增长后，为使装车、运输迅速跟上采矿的要求，职工们提出了向坡度要动力，向革新要劳力的豪迈口号。许多工人苦干巧干，把运输轨道的路基改造成坡度形，使全厂四十九条运输线普遍实现了矿车自动滑行。
    经过大搞技术革新与技术革命，使矿山的技术面貌发生了很大的变化，在辽阔的矿山上，已经看不到肩扛、人抬、手推车的现象。
    干部深入现场，从细小的地方发现大问题
    为了加强对生产的具体领导，组织生产的不断跃进，这个厂的领导干部经常深入生产第一线，具体领导生产，不断发现和克服薄弱环节。今年以来，每个月都抽出近十分之一干部实行轮流下放劳动，同时组织以党、政、工、团负责干部为首的工作组，分工到队、到组参加生产，领导生产；深入生产的干部与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同革新，实行了五包——包思想、包生产、包革新、包安全、包生活。许多干部在生产中积极帮助队、组干部出主意、想办法、改进领导方法。使不少问题得到了就地解决，推动了生产。李珍矿区5月份革新三十七项就有二十八项是干部和群众共同实现的。厂党委副书记路东成同志和工作组深入李珍矿区第三生产队后，发现生产中有三高三低现象，即白班产量高，夜班产量低；白班中上午产量低，下午产量高；夜班是上半夜产量高，下半夜产量低。经过工作组干部昼夜跟班劳动发觉夜班伙食搞得不好，因此到下半夜有些工人感到疲乏，工效随之降低，给下一班作的生产准备也差，所以白班一上班就得用半小时左右整理现场，影响了日班上午的产量。同时负责夜间值班的干部也是有名无实，放松了对生产的领导。根据这种情况，厂党委专门作了研究，一方面建立值班队长，加强对夜班生产的领导，另一方面狠抓生活，采取措施保证夜班工人休息好、吃饱喝好，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，使夜班工效大大超过了白班，推动了生产一班高过一班的向前发展。
