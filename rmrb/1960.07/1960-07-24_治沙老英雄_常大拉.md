    Old Hero of Desert Control - Chang Dala
    By our reporter Qin Jilun
    In the magnificent undertaking of large-scale desert control, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has seen the emergence of thousands of heroic model figures. Among the most famous is Chang Dala, a model Communist Party member of seventy-four years old, a national model worker in forestry, and a national active member of revolutionary martyrs' families.
    Ten Years of Hard Struggle
    Chang Dala's hometown, the Xingfu People's Commune in Bayan Nur League, faces the Yellow River to the east and is surrounded by sand on three sides. The entire commune clings to the edge of the Ulan Buh Desert like a ribbon. Before liberation, the forests and vegetation in the sand suffered massive plunder and brutal destruction by the reactionaries, causing the shifting sands to rampage eastward like runaway horses. In the thirty-plus years before liberation, more than a dozen villages were submerged by the shifting sands, over three hundred households were forced to migrate, and more than fifty thousand mu of fertile land were seized by the shifting sands. Every year, the shifting sands advanced towards farmland and villages at a rate of ten to fifteen meters. Farmland near the desert was often devastated by wind and sandstorms, resulting in nine out of ten crops failing, or even no harvest at all. Even in good years, the yield per mu was only seventy or eighty jin. The people of all ethnic groups lived a life of suffering, described as "the desert ruthlessly crushes fertile land, nine out of ten families run out of smoke for cooking, forcing people to move their homes." After liberation, the original Dengkou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to declare war on the desert. Chang Dala, who had been freed from more than forty years of indentured servitude, immediately responded positively. In 1951, he first cultivated seedlings and planted trees on the six mu of land he was allocated, and repeatedly promoted the benefits of planting trees and grass and controlling the desert to the masses. Every planting season, he went from house to house to mobilize the masses to plant trees and afforest. Chang Dala firmly believed that "listening to the Party is never wrong." Ignoring the ridicule of a few people, he patiently educated the masses while leading the activists in the village to plant more than fifty mu of trees on the edge of the fields and sand dunes, working from dawn till dusk. After the trees were planted, they fertilized the forest land, built embankments, and irrigated it. After two or three years of hard work, this young forest quickly grew. The crops protected by the forest avoided wind and sand disasters, and in 1953, the grain yield increased by about three times compared to the past. This fact made the majority of farmers realize the benefits of planting trees and dispelled the superstitious ideas of some people. From then on, more and more people, under his influence, launched a large-scale tree planting and afforestation and sand fixation and grass cultivation movement. Up to now, the whole commune has afforested more than 151,000 mu, fixed sand and cultivated grass on more than 700,000 mu, built more than 58,000 meters of windbreaks, and dug and repaired more than 40 desert canals. On the edge of the Ulan Buh Desert, they have created a windbreak forest belt that is more than seventy kilometers long and about two hundred and fifty meters wide. This forest belt is like a green Great Wall, blocking the vast shifting sands outside the forest belt. The entire commune has basically subdued the shifting sands, and more than 70% of the desert has been greened. The farmland, which is free from wind and sand disasters, has seen its yield per mu rise from seventy or eighty jin before liberation to more than three hundred jin. Timber, fuel, and forage have also become richer year by year.
    Old Tree, Young Roots
    Having tasted the bitterness of the old society, Chang Dala is filled with firm confidence in the cause of socialist construction and exudes a fervent revolutionary spirit. It is difficult to tell from his intense labor and healthy laughter that he is an old man in his seventies. He often says, "When people get old, their hearts don't get old; when trees get old, their roots don't get old." Indeed, Chang Dala's revolutionary enthusiasm cannot but be deeply praised by the people. Since 1951, whether in the snow-covered winter or the scorching summer sun, he has been working in the forest land almost every day, rain or shine. He also often goes to various work areas to help with work and goes deep into the desert to survey forest land. Sometimes, in order to guard the young forest, he carries his luggage and braves the wind and frost to spend the night in the forest land. One rainy night, Chang Dala went alone to manage the canals in the rain in order to irrigate the forest land and protect the farmland. The road was muddy, and the wind and rain were mixed. He accidentally fell into the canal, which was chest-deep. The canal water was turbulent and icy, and he almost lost his life. When he walked home late at night, draped in wet clothes, his wife said with concern and complaint, "You are seventy or eighty years old, and you still work so recklessly. What if you drown!" Chang Dala said, "A person should do more good deeds for the masses in his lifetime." After he finished speaking, he went to sleep peacefully. Diligent and selfless labor has enabled Chang Dala to explore rich experience in planting trees and controlling the desert. According to the law that wind and sand "like one thing and fear three" (likes wind and drought; fears trees, fears grass, fears water), in recent years, he has mobilized the masses of commune members to use a series of methods such as fixing sand by cultivating grass, planting trees and afforestation, diverting water to irrigate sand, and setting up wind and sand barriers, so that the shifting sands can no longer spread arbitrarily. "Plant willows on river beach wetlands, elms in clay soil, elaeagnus angustifolia in sandy wasteland, and tamarisk in saline-alkali land." This is the method of planting trees according to local conditions that he has found according to different soils. "Dig a big pit, plant in the middle, compact in layers without exposing to the wind" and "one bury, two step, three straighten the roots" are the planting methods he summed up. "Afforestation and grass cultivation must fix sand, water diversion and irrigation have great benefits, and reeds in sand pits and sand bays can accumulate into a lake for raising fish and ducks." This is the praise and conclusion of him and the vast number of commune members on water diversion and sand irrigation. Now these rich experiences are being widely spread throughout the autonomous region.
    Cultivating the Younger Generation
    "Old Chang" (this is the title of respect given to him by the local people), who has more than a dozen medals hanging on his chest, not only cherishes the honors given to him by the Party and the people, but also hopes that the younger generation will contribute all their strength to the great cause of conquering the desert, just like himself. In the ten years of afforestation and desert control, "Old Chang" patiently taught his rich experience to the young male and female commune members, and cultivated more than thirty activists around him as the backbone force for carrying out large-scale desert control work in the future. Now, among these thirty-plus activists, four have become national or autonomous region afforestation models or activists.
    On the edge of the desert, the story of "Old Chang" enthusiastically helping Mongolian farmers and herdsmen plant trees has become a good story of national unity and friendship. In 1954, some Mongolian farmers and herdsmen did not know how to plant trees, and they did not have seedlings. "Old Chang" gave them his large number of seedlings and taught them how to plant trees. After three or four years of sincere help, more than ten Mongolian farmers and herdsmen have built more than forty mu of gardens on the beach, and some trees are more than two zhang high. Every summer, in this ancient beach, the green trees cast shadows, and Osmanthus fragrans var. aurantiacus (elaeagnus angustifolia, also known as ten-mile fragrance) emits a rich fragrance. Many Mongolian farmers and herdsmen often invite him to drink and have fun to thank him for his kindness.
    Now, the prelude to the large-scale transformation of the desert in the autonomous region has begun. In this magnificent communist cause, this old man, who is over "ancient times," is in high spirits. This spring, he first responded to the Party's combat call of "complete the afforestation task for one year in one spring, and double the task for the whole year." Under the leadership of the commune party committee, he led the male and female commune members of the Hehao Brigade. After more than half a month of hard work, they overfulfilled the annual afforestation task by more than 5,000 mu.

    治沙老英雄——常大拉
    本报记者　秦继仑
    在大规模治理沙漠的宏伟事业中，内蒙古自治区涌现出成千上万的英雄模范人物。其中最著名的是全国林业劳动模范、全国烈军属积极分子、七十四岁的模范共产党员常大拉。
    十年苦战
    常大拉的家乡——巴彦高勒市幸福人民公社，东临黄河，三面环沙，全社像一条带子紧贴在乌兰布和大沙漠的边沿上。解放前，这里的林木和沙中植被，因遭反动派的大量掠夺和残酷破坏，致使流沙如脱缰之马，随风滚滚东侵。解放前三十多年间，十几个村庄被流沙淹没，三百多户人家被迫迁移，五万多亩良田被流沙夺去。流沙每年都以十米到十五米的速度向农田村庄进逼。靠近沙漠的农田常因风沙侵袭而十种九空，甚至颗粒无收。遇上好年景，每亩产量也不过七、八十斤。各族人民就这样常年过着“沙漠无情压良田，十家九户断炊烟，逼得人们把家搬”的苦难日子。解放后，原中共磴口县委员会发出向沙漠宣战的号召。摆脱了四十多年长工苦役生活的常大拉，立刻积极响应。1951年他首先在自己分到的六亩土地上培育苗木，植树造林，并向群众反复宣传植树育草和治理沙漠的好处。每到植树季节，他就挨家逐户去动员群众植树造林。常大拉坚信“听党的话不会错”。他不顾少数人冷嘲热讽，一面向群众耐心教育，一面率领村里的积极分子在田边沙畔，起早贪黑地栽了五十多亩树。树栽起来后，他们又在林地里培土施肥，打堰灌溉。经过两三年的辛勤抚育，这片幼林很快地成长起来。在林木保护下的庄稼，避免了风沙灾害，1953年粮食产量比过去提高了三倍左右。这个事实，使广大农民认识到植树的好处，破除了一部分人的迷信思想。从此，越来越多的群众，在他的影响下，展开了大规模的植树造林和封沙育草运动。到现在，全社已造林十五万一千多亩，封沙育草七十多万亩，打风墙五万八千多米，挖修沙漠渠道四十多条。在乌兰布和大沙漠的边沿上，他们营造起一条长达七十多公里、宽二百五十米左右的防沙林带。这条林带像一座绿色长城，把漫漫流沙拦截在林带之外。全社基本制伏了流沙，70％多的沙漠已经绿化。免受风沙灾害的农田，每亩产量已由解放前的七、八十斤，上升到三百多斤，木材、燃料和饲草等，也逐年丰富起来。
    树老根不老
    尝尽旧社会苦难的常大拉，对于社会主义建设事业，充满着坚定的必胜信念，洋溢着热烈的革命精神。人们在他紧张的劳动和健朗的谈笑中，很难看出他是一位七十多岁的老人。他常说：“人老心不老，树老根不老”。的确，常大拉的革命干劲，不能不受到人们的深深赞扬。从1951年以来，无论在风雪弥漫的严冬或烈日当头的酷暑，他几乎每天都是风里来，雨里去，在林地里操劳奔波，还经常到各作业区帮助工作，深入沙漠腹地勘测林地，有时为了看守幼林，他还背着行李，冒着风霜，夜宿林地。在一个风雨交加的夜晚，常大拉为了灌溉林地和保护农田，独自冒雨去看管渠道。那时道路泥泞，风雨交加，他失足掉进水深及胸的渠道里，渠水湍急，冰冷刺骨，险些丧失了生命。当他深夜披着湿淋淋的衣服走回家的时候，他妻子关切而埋怨地说：“你七、八十岁了，还是这样不知死活地干活，若是淹死了怎么办！”常大拉说：“人活一辈子，就应当多给群众做些好事。”说完就坦然入睡了。辛勤忘我地劳动，使常大拉摸索出丰富的植树造林和治理沙漠的经验。他根据风沙“一喜三怕”（喜风旱；怕树、怕草、怕水）的规律，近几年来，发动广大社员用封沙育草、植树造林、引水灌沙和设置防风沙障等一系列办法，已使流沙不能再任意泛滥了。“河滩湿地插杨柳，胶泥地里种榆树，沙荒微　栽沙枣，盐碱地里植红柳”，这就是他根据不同土壤找出的因地制宜的植树方法。“挖大坑、栽当中，分层踏实不露风”和“一埋两踩三顺根”，这是他总结出的栽培方法。“造林育草必封沙，引水灌溉效益大，沙坑沙湾芦草地，积成海子养鱼鸭”，这是他和广大社员们对引水灌沙的赞美和结论。现在这些丰富的经验，正在自治区各地广泛传播。
    培养年轻的一代
    胸前挂着十几枚奖章的“常老”（这是当地人们对他的尊称），不仅非常珍惜党和人民给予他的荣誉，更渴望年轻一代同他自己一样，为征服沙漠的伟大事业，贡献出全部力量。“常老”在十年的造林治沙工作中，把自己的丰富经验，耐心地教给了年轻的男女社员们，并在他的周围培养了三十多名积极分子，作为今后大规模开展治沙工作的骨干力量。现在这三十多名积极分子中，已有四人分别成了全国、自治区的造林模范或积极分子。
    在大沙漠的边沿上，“常老”热情地帮助蒙古族农牧民植树造林的故事，已经成为民族团结友爱的佳话。 1954年，有些蒙古族农牧民不会种树，也没有树苗。“常老”就把自己的大批树苗送给他们，并教给他们种树方法，经过连续三、四年的热诚帮助，现在十多户蒙古族农牧民，已在沙滩上营造了四十多亩园林，有些树已高达两丈多。每到夏天，在这个古老的沙滩上，绿树垂荫，桂香柳（即沙枣，又称十里香）散发出浓郁的清香。许多蒙古族农牧民为了感谢他的盛情帮助，常邀请他饮酒联欢。
    现在，自治区大规模改造沙漠的序幕已经揭开。在这个宏伟的共产主义事业中，这位年逾“古稀”的老人，斗志昂扬，意气风发，今年春天他又首先响应党的“一年造林任务一春完，全年任务翻一番”的战斗号召，在公社党委的领导下，率领河壕大队的男女社员，经过半个多月的艰苦努力，超额五千多亩完成了全年的造林任务。
