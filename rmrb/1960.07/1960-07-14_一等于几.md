　　One Equals How Many?
　　Wu Lü
　　“One equals how many?” This question seems absurd. One is one, so how can one equal several?

　　However, among the eighty-plus heavy industrial factories in Shanghai's Putuo District, by mid-June, sixty factories were not using one factory to replace just one, but one factory to replace two or three. That is to say, one does not equal one, but equals two or three.

　　The transition from one equaling one to one equaling two or three is the result of widely applying the abundant achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to production. As the technical innovation and technical revolution movement entered a new stage of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, the vast workforce on Shanghai's industrial front launched the "Every Innovation Bearing Fruit, Everyone Striving for One to Equal Several" competition. Their goal is: one person doing the work of several, one portion of materials doing the work of several, one factory doing the work of several, and one product doing the work of several, to achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward this year. The achievements of Putuo District are just one example. In all twelve districts of Shanghai, due to the widespread "one equals several" competition, by the end of June, 702 factories had already completed or exceeded half of their annual plans in advance according to the six major indicators. It is clear that the practical effect of the "one equals several" competition is very significant.

　　We do work and launch movements to achieve practical results, not to pursue empty reputations. Revolution and construction are both concrete matters. Focusing on empty reputations and neglecting practical results is detrimental to both revolution and construction. To ensure that every task and every movement achieves practical results, we must work diligently and practically. Take the technical innovation and technical revolution movement as an example: many innovation projects have already increased production efficiency by tens or even hundreds of percent. This means that "one equals several" has already become possible and has created favorable conditions for completing or exceeding the state plan ahead of schedule. However, if the work is not done solidly and remains superficial, even if the conditions for "one equals several" exist, it may not truly be achieved; even if there are conditions for completing or exceeding the state plan ahead of schedule, it is not guaranteed to actually complete or exceed the state plan ahead of schedule. For example, if an innovation is successful and production efficiency can be doubled, but it is not promoted, or even if it is promoted, it is not consistently used, then the success of this innovation will be difficult to translate into practical results in production. In that case, one is still one, so how can it equal two?

　　The slogan "one equals several" is very good; it is a slogan that emphasizes practical results. It requires us to examine the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement from the perspective of the actual effects on production and to fully apply the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to production. To achieve the goal of "one equals several," we must promote a solid and practical work style. Only by doing the work solidly can the results of technical innovation be continuously consolidated, continuously promoted, and continuously improved, and each item will be reflected in production results.

　　一等于几
　　吴滤
    “一等于几？”这个问题看来是荒唐的。一就是一，一还能等于几呢？
    然而，上海市普陀区的八十多家重工业工厂中，到6月中旬，已经有六十家工厂不是一个厂顶一个厂用，而是一个厂顶两个厂、顶三个厂用。这就是说，一不是等于一，而是等于二、等于三了。
    由一等于一，到一等于二、等于三，这是把技术革新和技术革命运动的丰硕成果广泛运用于生产的结果。当技术革新和技术革命运动进入巩固、推广、提高的新的阶段的时候，上海工业战线上的广大职工就开展了“条条革新结满果，人人力争一顶几”的竞赛活动。他们的目标是：一个人顶几个人用，一份材料顶几份材料用，一个厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用，实现今年更好更全面的继续跃进。普陀区的战果，不过是其中之一。全上海十二个区中，由于广泛开展了“一顶几”的竞赛活动，到6月下旬为止，已经有七百零二家工厂，按照六大指标提前完成和超额完成了全年计划的一半。可见，“一顶几”的竞赛运动所收到的实效是大得很的。
    我们做工作，搞运动，都是为了收实效，而不是为了务虚名。革命、建设，都是实实在在的事情。务虚名而轻实效，对革命、对建设，都是不利的。要使每一件工作，每一个运动都收到实效，就必须踏踏实实地去做工作。拿技术革新和技术革命运动来说，许多革新项目已经使生产效率提高了百分之几十，甚至百分之几百。这就是说：已经使“一顶几”成为可能，已经为提前和超额完成国家计划创造了有利的条件。但是，如果工作做得不踏实，浮在表面上，虽有“一顶几”的条件，却未必真能做到“一顶几”；虽有提前和超额完成国家计划的条件，也未见得就提前和超额完成国家计划。例如，一项革新成功了，生产效率可以提高一倍，但并没有推广，或者虽然推广了并没有坚持使用，因而这项革新的成功，也就很难在生产上收到实效。一岂不还是一，哪能顶上两个呢？
    “一顶几”的口号很好，这是一个讲实际效果的口号。它要求我们从生产的实际效果来考察技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，把技术革新和技术革命运动的成果充分运用到生产中去。而要实现“一顶几”的目标，必须发扬踏踏实实的工作作风。只有踏踏实实地去做工作，技术革新的成果才能不断巩固、不断推广、不断提高，一项一项地都反映到生产效果中来。
