Strengthening Specific Guidance for Practical Work
——Seeing the Importance of Improving Cadre Work Style from the Implementation of the “Two-Five System”
You Panjing, First Secretary of the CPC Sinan County Committee

In order to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, the CPC Sinan County Committee has adopted a series of effective measures to improve leadership methods since the spring plowing season to adapt to the development of the situation. The “Two-Five System” leadership method, which was quickly promoted throughout the county from point to area starting in April, is the most important of these measures. Although this method has only been implemented for just over two months, it has already shown many benefits, powerfully promoting the rush harvesting and planting campaign and the current upsurge in field management.

The situation of a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in Sinan County is very good. Under this new situation, how leading cadres arrange their work, study, labor, and inspection and summary work is a very important question. From this period of practice, the “Two-Five System” leadership method is of great significance to the implementation of the Party’s mass line work method. It can scientifically solve the relationship between these four aspects and promote each other. Facts have once again proved that it is far from enough to have only enthusiasm and the desire to do a good job to complete any revolutionary task. We must also have good methods. Just as Chairman Mao taught us in the article "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work":
"We must not only raise tasks, but also solve the problem of methods for accomplishing them. Our task is to cross a river, but we cannot cross it without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of the bridge or the boat, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of methods, the task is just empty talk." The "Two-Five" system of leadership is a good working method for completing tasks.

Under the excellent situation where all tasks are advancing by leaps and bounds, if leaders at all levels do not personally participate in production, go to the front line to lead production, and rely solely on listening to reports and reading reports to guide production, they will easily commit subjectivist errors and fall behind the mass movement. Therefore, this is a major principle issue in adhering to the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership style and leadership methods. Cadres' personal participation in productive labor can not only temper their labor viewpoints and ideological consciousness, but also obtain direct knowledge of agricultural production to guide production, so that the subjective conforms to the objective and proceeds from reality. Since March, Sinan County has successively transferred more than 1,100 cadres, accounting for 87% of the total, to the front line of production to participate in production and lead production. Among them are 24 county committee members and 73 county and district-level cadres. The six departments of the county committee have also moved to rural areas or factories and mines to work. In the past two months, these cadres have averaged 28 working days each. Of the 90 full-time cadres in the Tangtou Commune, 25 used to sit in offices. After the implementation of the “Two-Five System” leadership method, except for three people who remained in the office, all the rest went deep into the grassroots to participate in production and lead production, making the various tasks of this commune consistently advanced. Practice has proven that leading cadres going deep into the front line is an extremely important measure for correctly implementing Mao Zedong Thought's leadership style and leadership methods. The reason why all production and construction undertakings in the county have leaped again and again seems to be one of the important factors.

Another prominent feature of the "Two-Five System" leadership method is the scientific arrangement of study time. Socialist construction is developing rapidly, the tasks are many and arduous, time is tight, and new things and new problems are constantly emerging. To make the leadership adapt to this new situation, it is necessary to seriously study the Party's policies and Mao Zedong's works, and constantly improve the policy level and leadership level of cadres. Quite a few cadres feel that their leadership level is low and urgently require study. However, in the past, due to the lack of scientific arrangement of study time, they were trapped in the circle of affairs, so the level of policy theory improved very slowly. The "Two-Five System" leadership method stipulates that two days a week are spent studying and researching the Party's policies and discussing and arranging work, so that work and study not only do not conflict, but also promote each other, greatly improving the policy level and leadership level of cadres. Cadres in Sinan County have generally studied Chairman Mao's article "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and the atmosphere of cadres caring about the lives of the masses has greatly increased. In the Liujing Management Area of Wenjiadian Commune, cadres led the masses to build seven bridges during production gaps, and planted an additional 261 mu of chili peppers and soybeans, greatly promoting the production of the canteen's family assets, which the masses were extremely satisfied with. After studying Chairman Mao's article, Wang Yuchun, secretary of the Xujiaba Commune Party Committee, immediately made 15 poor peasant friends, further mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the commune members. Practice has once again proven that only by seriously studying the Party's policies and Mao Zedong's works, and letting cadres understand the Party's policies, can they be correctly publicized to the masses, and can there be a great leap forward in various undertakings.

The “Two-Five System” leadership method also scientifically arranges the time for inspecting production, which greatly reduces bureaucratic work style. Agricultural production is highly seasonal, and failure to inspect and supervise in a timely manner may cause losses. The "Two-Five System" leadership method enables cadres to go deep down, and there is also a system of daily inspection of production quantity and quality, which avoids the above shortcomings. Due to timely inspection, some backward production units that had not been discovered in the past were also found. The county committee immediately sent more than 100 capable cadres to strengthen leadership and quickly changed the face of these units. Forty of the original sixty-one backward production teams have now undergone outstanding changes.

The "Two-Five System" leadership method also has a positive significance for helping small team cadres improve their leadership level. For example, using production gaps and evenings to give advice to small teams and help them come up with ideas. Cadres above the team level insist on the "helping" method every day, which quickly improved their awareness and enabled them to initially learn the method of taking the mass line. Two thousand one hundred small team leaders in the county have now made six thousand two hundred poor peasant friends. These people have become capable assistants to the small team cadres and have driven the masses of the entire team.

Does the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method reduce meetings and weaken the Party's leadership? No. On the contrary, the Party committee's collective leadership has been strengthened. Because, fixed time for discussing major issues has been arranged, leading cadres go deep into the grassroots, gain direct production experience, enrich their leadership knowledge, grasp the situation, and then go through collective discussion, which better strengthens specific leadership of practical work. From the perspective of the entire county, the improvement of leadership methods and the transformation of cadre work styles have greatly promoted the current various tasks. A vigorous and comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production and overproduction movement has now been launched throughout the county. (Originally published in Guizhou Daily)

    增强了对实际工作的具体指导
    ——从推行“二五制”看改进干部作风的重要性
    中共思南县委第一书记　游盼景
    中共贵州思南县委为了实现今年农业生产全面跃进，从春耕开始，就采取了一系列的有效措施来改进领导方法，以适应形势的发展。从4月份起，由点到面，很快在全县范围推行的“二五制”领导方法，就是其中最重要的一个措施。这一方法推行到现在，虽然仅仅只有两个多月的时间，但已显示了许多好处，有力地促进了抢收抢种运动和当前的田间管理高潮。
    思南县农业生产全面跃进的形势是很好的。在这种新形势下，领导干部如何安排工作、学习、劳动和检查总结工作，是一个很重要的问题。从这一段的实践看来，“二五制”的领导方法，对贯彻党的群众路线的工作方法有着重要意义，它可以科学地解决这四个方面的关系问题，使其相互促进。事实又一次证明了：完成任何一项革命工作，仅有热情和作好的愿望，是远远不够的，还必须有好的方法。正如毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中教导我们的一样，
  “我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”“二五”制的领导方法，就是一种完成任务的好的工作方法。
    在各项工作一日千里地前进的大好形势下，各级领导干部如不亲自参加生产，到第一线去领导生产，光靠听汇报、看报告的方法来指导生产，便容易犯主观主义的错误，便会落后于群众运动。因此，这是坚持党的马克思列宁主义的领导作风和领导方法的重大原则问题。干部亲自参加生产劳动，不仅可以锻炼自己的劳动观点和思想意识，而且可以获得农业生产上的直接知识，来指导生产，使主观符合于客观，做到从实际出发。思南县自3月份以来，陆续抽调了占87％的一千一百多名干部到生产第一线上去，参加生产领导生产。其中有二十四个县委委员和七十三个县、区级干部，县委的六个部也搬到农村或厂矿办公。两个月来，这些干部平均每人做了二十八个劳动日。塘头公社的九十个脱产干部，过去有二十五人经常坐机关，实行“二五制”的领导方法后，除留三人坚持机关工作以外，其余全部深入基层参加生产，领导生产，使这个公社的各项工作一直处于先进。实践证明：领导干部深入第一线，正是正确贯彻毛泽东思想的领导作风和领导方法的一个极其重要的措施。全县各项生产和建设事业所以一跃再跃，看来这就是重要因素之一。
      “二五制”的领导方法，另一个突出的特点是科学的安排了学习时间。社会主义建设飞跃发展，任务多而繁重，时间紧迫，新事物、新问题不断出现。要使领导适应这种新形势，就必须认真学习党的政策和毛泽东著作，不断地提高干部的政策水平与领导水平。相当多的干部都感到自己的领导水平低，迫切要求学习。但是，过去由于没有科学地安排学习时间，陷在事务圈子里，因而政策理论水平提高很慢。“二五制”的领导方法，规定了每周两天学习、研究党的政策和讨论安排工作的时间，做到了工作和学习不但不矛盾，而且互相促进，大大地提高了干部的政策水平与领导水平。思南县干部普遍学习了毛主席的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的文章，干部中关心群众生活的风气大长。文家店公社六井管理区，干部带领群众，趁生产空隙修了七座桥，增种了二百六十一亩海椒、黄豆，大大促进了食堂家底生产，群众极为满意。许家坝公社党委书记汪育春同志，学习毛主席的这篇文章后，立即交了十五个贫农朋友，进一步调动了社员的生产积极性。实践再一次证明：只有认真学习党的政策和毛泽东著作，让干部懂得党的政策，才能正确宣传到群众中去，才有各项事业的大跃进。
      “二五制”领导方法，还科学地安排了检查生产的时间，这就大大减少官僚主义作风。农业生产季节性很强，不及时检查督促，就有可能造成损失。“二五制”的领导方法，使干部们都深入下去了，又有每天检查生产数量和质量的制度，这就避免了上述缺点。由于及时检查，还发现了一些过去没有发现的后进生产单位，县委立即增派一百多名得力干部加强了领导，迅速改变了这些单位的面貌。原有的六十一个后进生产队，现已有四十个起了突出的变化。
    “二五制”的领导方法，对于帮助小队干部提高领导水平也有积极的意义，例如，利用每天生产空隙和晚上，给小队当参谋，帮助他们出主意。队以上的干部坚持每天“帮”的办法，迅速提高了他们觉悟，使他们初步学会了走群众路线的方法。全县二千一百个小队长，现已广交贫农朋友六千二百多人。这些人都成了小队干部的得力助手，带动了全队的群众。
    实行“二五制”领导方法，会议减少了，是否削弱了党的领导呢？没有。相反，党委集体领导增强了。因为，安排了固定的讨论重大问题的时间，领导干部深入基层，取得了直接生产经验，丰富了领导知识，掌握了情况，然后再经过集体讨论，这就更好的加强对实际工作的具体领导。从全县看，领导方法的改进，干部作风的转变，大大推动了当前各项工作。全县现已掀起一个轰轰烈烈的农业全面跃进的超产运动。　（原载贵州日报）
