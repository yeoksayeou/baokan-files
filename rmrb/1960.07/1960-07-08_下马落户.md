Party Secretary's Notes

    Disembarking and Settling Down
    Feng Lin, First Secretary of the Shou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anhui Province

    On the track of continuous leaps forward, due to the different natural conditions between regions, the different strengths of leadership, and the differences in working methods and mass awareness, the difference between advanced and backward is inevitable. The responsibility of us leaders is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, help those backward areas catch up quickly, and seek a comprehensive leap forward in our construction work.

    There are many ways to help backward areas change their appearance, such as strengthening leadership organizationally, providing material support, and giving spiritual encouragement. All of these are effective. In addition to this, there is also a very important method, that is, for leaders to dismount and settle down in backward areas.

    Here, let me tell a true story that happened in the Diaodun Production Team of the Yanliu Commune in Shou County. This team was "old and backward," "old and downstream." From the word "old," it can be seen that its backwardness is not a matter of one day or two. The brigade cadres did not conduct specific and in-depth research into the reasons for the backwardness. For more than a year, they only criticized and blamed excessively. As a result, the backwardness remained. Were the masses of this team willingly backward? No. Was the mass base poor? No, most of the sixty-one members were poor and lower-middle peasants. So where was the secret? This spring, Hu Guocheng, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, uncovered the mystery.

    After Comrade Hu Guocheng settled down in this team, he served as the production team leader, eating, living, and laboring with the members. After a period of time, he discovered that the team's party branch secretary was not good at arranging production, and most of the other team leaders were wealthy middle peasants, so the poor and lower-middle peasants could not speak up. In addition, the living arrangements were not good, so the members' morale was not high, and production was backward. Finding the reason, Comrade Hu Guocheng prescribed the right medicine. First, he started by solving the leadership problem, establishing a team committee, arranging eight poor and lower-middle peasants among the nine team and group cadres, and nine poor and lower-middle peasants among the thirteen team committee members, putting the power of the seal in the hands of the poor peasants. In terms of livelihood, he personally helped the members arrange grain usage plans. The canteen was too big and inconvenient for eating, so he helped set up branch canteens. If there were no stoves, he personally started building them. At that time, this team had a lot of paddy fields that needed plowing, but because the spring cold was still strong, the members had a wait-and-see attitude. Some cadres advocated holding a meeting to debate. He said: No, let's take the lead! So, he harnessed two oxen and personally went to the field with the branch secretary to plow. When the members saw the two secretaries taking the lead in the charge, they could no longer sit still. They all led their oxen and carried their plows, taking the initiative to go into battle. The 1,800 mu of paddy fields that were originally not intended to be plowed were quickly plowed once.

    With the leadership problem solved and the living arrangements made well, Hu Guocheng then helped formulate various production quotas and various production plans. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses grew greater and greater. The four formerly so-called "backward elements" of poor and lower-middle peasants, since taking up the positions of professional team leaders, have been working enthusiastically. In this way, this production team, known for its "backwardness," was actually named on the red list in this year's spring plowing production. And Comrade Hu Guocheng? The members also gave him a title: "A capable person!"

    The example of Diaodun Production Team changing from backward to advanced raises a thought-provoking question for us: What attitude should we take towards backward areas? From what we have seen, the vast majority of party cadres are like Hu Guocheng, not afraid of difficulties or retreating, going deep into backward areas to settle down, relying on the masses, and throwing themselves into the actual struggle to transform backward areas with full enthusiasm. In contrast, there are also several types of people, for example, some people are accustomed to blaming the low level of grassroots cadres. Criticizing left and right, as for why they are low level, why they are backward, they do not ask about it; some people avoid it at the first sign of trouble, not wanting to go to backward areas, mainly because they are afraid of doing hard work and lack courage; there are also some people who ride tall horses, running all over the world, working in a not meticulous way, supposedly because the scope of work is now broad, there are many things to take care of, they can't squat down, and they can't be too hasty about backward areas, and so on. According to these comrades' approach, it seems that backward areas are destined to be backward, and there is no good way other than to criticize, avoid, and wait. Just think, what a harmful thought this is, what a timid behavior!

    Compared with Comrade Hu Guocheng, these comrades lack something. What is missing? Our "chemical analysis" results show that they lack a fiery revolutionary vigor, a courage to take on difficulties, and a revolutionary sense of responsibility that cannot tolerate backwardness. As mentioned earlier, we are in an era of great leap forward. In the torrent of the great leap forward, there should be no calm places, and no backward dead ends should be retained in any work area. Turning backwardness into advancement and promoting advancement to be even more advanced is the responsibility of us leaders. Now let us review Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao wants us to "help those places where work is weak and help those comrades who are not yet good at their work to do their work well." In addition, let us also learn from Comrade Hu Guocheng's spirit of dismounting and settling down, "use practical methods to improve our work," so that every backward area and every backward fighter can step onto the track of the great leap forward!

    下马落户
    中共安徽寿县县委第一书记　冯林
    在持续跃进的跑道上，由于地区之间的自然条件不同，领导力量的强弱不同，工作方法和群众觉悟的差异，这就不可避免地出现了先进与后进的差别。我们领导者的责任，就是应当遵循毛主席的指示，帮助那些后进的地方迅速赶上来，求得我们的建设工作全面跃进。
    帮助落后地区改变面貌，有很多方法，比如在组织上加强领导，在物质上给以支援，在精神上予以鼓励，凡此种种，都是行之有效的。除此而外，也还有一个很重要的办法，那就是领导下马，到落后地方去落户。
    这里，我来说一件真实的事，这事发生在寿县炎刘公社刁墩生产队。这个队“老落后”、“老下游”，从一个“老”字上，可见它的落后已非一朝一夕了。大队干部没有具体深入研究落后原因，一年多来只是过多地批评、指责，结果，落后还是落后。是这个队的群众自甘落后吗？不是；是群众基础差吗？也不是，六十一户社员中，大部分是贫农和下中农。那么秘密到底在哪里呢？今年春天，公社党委副书记胡国成同志揭开了谜底。
    胡国成同志到这个队落户后，担任了生产队长，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动，经过一段时间，才发现队里支部书记不善于安排生产，其他几个队长大都是富裕中农，贫农和下中农吃不开，加上生活安排也不好，因此，社员情绪不高，生产落后。找到原因，胡国成同志就对症下药，首先从解决领导问题入手，建立队委会，九名队、组干部中安排了八个贫农和下中农，十三个队委中安排了九个贫农和下中农，把印把子拿到了贫农手里。在生活上，他亲自帮助社员安排用粮计划，食堂过大，吃饭不方便，就帮助办起分堂；没有锅灶，就亲自动手来砌。当时，这个队有很多水田需要翻耕，但因春寒尚浓，社员有观望情绪，有些干部主张开会辩论，他说：不，我们来带个头吧！于是，他套了两头牛，同支部书记一道亲自下田去犁。社员看到两位书记带头冲锋，一个个再也蹲不住了，纷纷牵牛扛犁，自动上阵，一千八百亩原来不打算翻耕的水田，很快就全部翻耕一遍。
    领导问题解决了，生活安排好了，胡国成紧接着又帮助制订了各项生产定额，制订了各项生产计划，于是，群众的干劲越来越大；四个原来所谓“落后分子”的贫农下中农，自从担任了专业队长以后，工作干得热火朝天。就这样，这个以“落后”闻名的生产队，在今年的春耕生产中，竟然红榜题名了。胡国成同志呢？社员也送了他一个封号：“有本事的人！”
    刁墩生产队落后变先进的事例，给我们提出了一个值得深思熟虑的问题：应该以怎样的态度来对待落后地区呢？从接触到的情况来看，绝大多数党的干部都像胡国成那样，不畏难退缩，深入到落后地区落户，依靠群众，满腔热情地投入到改造落后地区的实际斗争中去。与此相反，也还有这样几种人，比如，有的人习惯责怪基层干部水平低。左批评，右指责，至于为什么低，为什么落后，就不去过问了；有的人则望风回避，不想到落后地区去，这主要是怕做艰苦工作，缺乏勇气；也有的人身骑高头大马，一跑遍天下，工作不细致，据说理由是现在的工作范围广，头绪多，蹲不下来，对落后地区不能操之过急，云云。按照这些同志的做法，好像落后地区就是注定要落后，除了指责、回避，等待，别无良策。试想，这是一种多么有害的思想，一种多么胆怯的行为！
    同胡国成同志比较，这些同志身上缺少了一种东西，缺少了什么呢？我们“化验”结果，认为在他们身上缺少一种火热的革命干劲，缺乏一种见困难就上的勇气，缺乏一种不能容忍落后的革命责任感。前面说过，我们处在大跃进的时代，在大跃进的洪流里，就不应该有风平浪静的地方，任何一个工作地区都不应该保留落后的死角。把落后变先进，促先进更先进，这是我们领导者的责任。现在让我们来温习一下毛主席的指示，毛主席要我们
  “帮助那些工作薄弱的地方，帮助那些还不善于工作的同志们做好工作。”此外让我们也来学胡国成同志的下马落户的精神，“用切实的办法来改善我们的工作”，从而让每一个后进的地区，每一个后进的战士，都跨到大跃进的跑道上来！
