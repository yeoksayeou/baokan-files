    New Look of Qingshan
    Zhao Tengyun, First Secretary of the Qingshan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Wuhan

    Seeing the magnificent blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces being built at a flying speed, everyone praises the great strength of the Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation builders. Here, it contains the hard work of women liberated from housework. "Everything for more steel" is their lofty aspiration. Yang Huiyun, the director of Renjialu Welding Rod Factory, and worker Wang Guifen encountered heavy rain on the way to deliver a batch of welding rods urgently needed by the steelmaking plant. Regardless of the biting cold wind, they took off their cotton coats to wrap the welding rods. Wang Guifen's finger was cut a large piece by the iron sheet, and blood flowed straight down. Yang Huiyun tore her new cotton jacket and wrapped it with cotton. They delivered the rods to the construction site in one breath, their bodies soaked with sweat and rain, ensuring the needs of the construction. The female workers of the Jiangjia Street Screw Processing Factory, in order to process more than 4,000 sets of seven-point screws for the No. 4 coke oven, had never done it before, and there were no tools of this size. However, they said: "An iron pestle can also be ground into an embroidery needle. In order to support Wuhan Iron and Steel, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." They made seven-point taps and dies overnight, and completed the task on time. Although the Pioneer Welding Rod Factory has only been established for a few months, the female workers here have trial-produced advanced hard alloy welding rods, reaching the advanced level in the country. Pan Taoxiang of Jiangjia Street Comprehensive Hardware Factory had never seen a machine in February last year, but in February this year, she became the workshop director of the factory, creating a medium-sized wire drawing machine and increasing work efficiency by three times. These housewives, who not long ago were still revolving around the stove all day long, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, were liberated from the family chores of one household, which made people ignorant. They devoted themselves to the upsurge of socialist construction with selfless enthusiasm, noble style, and infinite wisdom, becoming a vital force of the working class.
    Many housewives, after participating in work, are praised by their husbands, saying: "People have become smarter." The relationship between husband and wife has also changed. Before Hu Suying, a female worker at the Screw Processing Factory, joined the factory, her lover Xu Zhicheng always said that she was "filled with stones in her heart, stupid and silly." One was busy with the Great Leap Forward and technical revolution all day long, and the other was always nagging about buying vegetables and rice. They often quarreled. Since Hu Suying became a screw worker, the situation has been very different. Hu Suying made exquisite screws, and Xu Zhicheng said: "I didn't expect my wife to be so capable!" They never quarrel again.
    With the increase in the number of employees and the increase in the number of dual-income households, coupled with the participation of many housewives in social labor, the vast number of employees and their families urgently demand the socialization of housework and have great enthusiasm for collective life. The masses run canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, and various life service stations in a big way, and the affairs of one household become the affairs of everyone.
    In the Hongxia Nursery, led by Xiong Qiongzhen, a March 8th Red Banner pacesetter and Communist Party member, the nannies are carefully cultivating the flowers of the motherland. In order to take care of night shift workers, they also specially opened night nursery classes, becoming the logistics of production and relatives of the children. Liu Chengxin, a 63-year-old lady, automatically took care of seventeen or eight children for her neighbors, working during the day and studying revolutionary stories at night, and telling them to the children the next day. When people asked her why she did this, she said: "I am old and can't engage in production and construction. What does it matter to take care of children for everyone!" In the hearts of such people, there is only the collective interest, no personal gain, and their actions shine with the brilliance of collectivism.
    Obviously, these are the communist styles shown by people in order to build a happy life. This also reflects that people are thoroughly changing their spiritual outlook in the furnace of collective production and collective life.

    青山新貌
    中共武汉市青山区委第一书记　赵腾云
    看到一座座雄伟的高炉和平炉以飞跃的速度建设起来，谁都赞扬武钢建设者的巨大力量。这里，包含着从家务劳动中解放出来的妇女们的辛勤劳动。“一切为了多出钢”，就是她们的崇高志向。任家路电焊条厂的厂长杨惠云和工人王桂芬，在送炼钢厂急需的一批电焊条时，路上遇到了大雨，她们不顾寒风刺骨，把棉衣脱下来裹住电焊条。王桂芬的手指被铁皮划去了一大块，鲜血直流，杨惠云就把新棉袄撕破，用棉花给她包上，就这样一口气送到工地，浑身都被汗和雨湿透，保证了施工的需要。蒋家街螺丝加工厂的女工为了给四号焦炉加工四千多套七分螺丝，过去根本没有做过，也没有这样大尺寸的工具，但她们说：“铁杵也能磨成绣花针，为了支援武钢，没有克服不了的困难”，连夜自己制造出七分的丝椎、板牙，按时完成了任务。先锋电焊条厂虽然办起来只有几个月，这里的女工却试制出高级硬质合金电焊条，达到了全国的先进水平。蒋家街综合五金厂的潘桃香，去年2月间还没有见过机器，今年2月间却当了这个厂的车间主任，创造出中型拉丝机，提高工效三倍。这些不久以前还成天围着锅台转的家庭妇女，在党和毛主席的领导下，从使人愚昧的一家一户的家务劳动中解放出来，就是这样以忘我的热情，高尚的风格，无穷的智慧，投入社会主义建设的热潮中，成为工人阶级的生力军。
    许多家庭妇女参加了工作后，她们的丈夫夸奖说：“人都变聪明了”。夫妇关系也起了变化。螺丝加工厂女工胡素英参加工厂前，她爱人许志成总说她“心给石头塞住了，又笨又傻”，一个成天忙大跃进，技术革命，一个总是唠叨买菜、买米，话说不到一块儿，经常吵嘴。自从胡素英当了螺丝工以后，情况就大不相同了。胡素英做出了精巧的螺丝，许志成说：“想不到我的爱人这么能干！”他们再也不吵嘴了。
    随着职工人数的增加，双职工户增多，加上许多家庭妇女参加了社会劳动，广大职工和家属迫切要求家务劳动社会化，对集体生活抱有极大的热情。群众大办食堂、幼儿园、托儿所和各种生活服务站，一家一户的事成了大家的事。
    在三八红旗手、共产党员熊琼珍领导的虹霞托儿所里，阿姨们精心培养着祖国的花朵。为了照顾夜班工人，还特别开了夜托班，成为生产的后勤，孩子的亲人。六十三岁的刘诚心老太太自动给四邻带了十七、八个小孩，白天工作，晚上学习革命故事，第二天讲给孩子们听。人家问她为什么要这样做，她说：“我老了，不能搞生产建设，为大家带带孩子算得了什么！”在这样的人的心里，只有集体的利益，没有个人的私利，所作所为，都闪耀着集体主义的光辉。
    很显然，这些就是人们为了建设幸福生活而表现出来的共产主义风格。这也反映出，人们正在集体生产和集体生活的洪炉中，彻底改变着自己的精神面貌。
