Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 27th: Indian private financial capital is increasingly moving towards monopoly and deepening its control over the Indian economy. At the same time, foreign investment is increasing.

According to a recent report by the Reserve Bank of India, the total number of private banks in India has decreased from 584 in 1949 to 362 in 1959. During the same period, the number of private banks with deposits of more than 250 million rupees increased from six to fourteen. During this period, the proportion of these large banks' deposits in the total deposits of all private banks increased from 52% to 68%.

A recent article in the "New Age" weekly, discussing this situation, said, "The concentration in the banking sector is very intense." The article pointed out that during this period, the number of smaller banks not included in the table decreased from 521 to 269, and their total share in total deposits decreased from 13.2% to 3.8%. "This means that more than ten large banks have become larger by forcing countless small banks out of business."

The article pointed out that the largest private banks are controlled by the Tata, Birla, and Jain consortiums. "The entire industry is increasingly financially dependent on the banking system. In June 1949, the total amount of bank loans to industry was 1,594.3 million rupees, while in October 1959, it was 4,185 million rupees. This shows that large banks have greatly controlled industry." The article, citing a report from the Reserve Bank of India, also indicated that "at least some of these loans are used for speculation and profiteering."

According to official figures from the "Indian Production Survey" involving 29 major Indian industrial consortia, comparing the figures for 1947 with those for 1956, the number of large factories employing 1,000 or more workers has increased from 350 to 507. During this period, the percentage of these factories' total output in the total output of all factories increased from 48.4% to 55.6%.

The "New Age" weekly article pointed out that in 1956, two large soap factories accounted for 66.6% of the total output of the soap industry; five match factories accounted for 74.6% of the total output of the match industry; eight steel factories accounted for 82% of the total output of the steel industry; four bicycle factories accounted for 53.1% of the total output of the bicycle industry; and one sewing machine factory accounted for 83.4% of the total output of the sewing machine industry.

In addition to this, there is a lot of foreign capital in Indian industry. According to figures in the draft outline of the Third Five-Year Plan, foreign direct loans or foreign private capital investment in Indian industry during the Second Five-Year Plan (April 1956 to March 1961) was 2 billion rupees, and will reach 3 billion rupees during the new Third Five-Year Plan.

According to the Reserve Bank of India's April bulletin, foreign investment in India has increased from 4.56 billion rupees at the end of 1955 to 5.7064 billion rupees at the end of 1958. Among them, foreign private investment increased from 4.533 billion rupees to 4.984 billion rupees. During this period, the proportion of U.S. investment increased the fastest, from 397.6 million rupees to 598.5 million rupees, an increase of 50%. British investment increased from the original 3.7681 billion rupees to 3.9803 billion rupees, an increase of 5.6%.

According to the bulletin, a large amount of foreign private capital profits flows out of India every year. Of the total of 244 million rupees that flowed out in 1958, foreign oil companies remitted as much as 218 million rupees.

The "Economic Weekly" said in a special issue in June that, judging from some of the agreements concluded so far, it is clear that foreign capital and technical assistance flow into India for exploitation in the Indian market. The weekly pointed out that most of these agreements prohibit the export of goods manufactured in India with the assistance of foreign collaborators and under the names of foreign firms. According to the weekly, the shortcomings of this system of cooperation with foreign countries include: "Subsidiary producers are also forced to reach technical cooperation agreements with well-known foreign companies" because industries cooperating with foreign countries refuse to use locally manufactured parts; "the relevant industries remain under the control of foreign collaborators"; "under this system, the technical knowledge obtained may not be used to establish independent units"; "Indians are not to be trained in the design and construction of factories and machines."

    印度私人金融资本日益走向垄断
    外国投资迅速增加　美国投资比例上升最快
    新华社27日讯　新德里消息：印度私人金融资本正日益走向垄断，并且加深对印度经济的控制。同时，外国投资正在增加。
    据印度储备银行最近的报告，印度私人银行的总数已经从1949年的五百八十四家减少到1959年的三百六十二家。同一时期，拥有二亿五千多万卢比存款的私人银行却从六家增加到十四家。在这个期间，这些大银行的存款数额在全部私人银行存款总数中的比例从52％增加到68％。
    最近一期“新世纪”周报在文章中谈到这一情况时说，“银行界的集中是十分激烈的。”这篇文章指出，在这个时期中，不列入表的小银行的数目从五百二十一家减少到二百六十九家，它们在整个存款中的总分额从13.2％降低到3.8％。“这就是说，十多家大银行由于使无数小银行停业而变得更大起来。”
    文章指出，最大的私人银行是由塔塔，比拉和贾殷财阀控制的，“整个工业在财政上日益依赖银行系统。在1949年6月，银行向工业贷款的总数为十五亿九千四百三十万卢比，而在1959年10月是四十一亿八千五百万卢比。这表明大银行已经极大地控制了工业。”文章在援引印度储备银行的报告时还表明，“这些贷款中至少有一部分是用来进行投机和觅取暴利的。”
    根据官方的“印度生产调查”所透露的涉及印度二十九个主要工业财团的统计数字，如果把1947年的数字和1956年的数字相比较，雇用一千或一千名以上工人的大工厂的数目，已经从三百五十个增加到五百零七个。在这个期间，这些工厂的总产值在全部工厂的总产值中的百分比从48.4％增加到55.6％。
    “新世纪”周报的文章指出，1956年，两家大肥皂厂占肥皂工业总产值的66.6％；五家火柴厂占火柴工业总产值的74.6％；八家钢铁厂占钢铁工业总产值的82％；四家自行车厂占自行车工业总产值的53.1％；一家缝纫机厂占缝纫机工业总产值的83.4％。
    除此以外，在印度工业中，有许多外国资本。据第三个五年计划纲要草案的数字表明，外国的直接贷款或外国私人资本对印度工业的投资在第二个五年计划期间（1956年4月到1961年3月）是二十亿卢比，在新的第三个五年计划期间将达三十亿卢比。
    根据印度储备银行4月份的公报，外国企业对印度的投资已经从1955年年底的四十五亿六千万卢比增加到1958年年底的五十七亿零六百四十万卢比。其中，外国私人投资从四十五亿三千三百万卢比增加到四十九亿八千四百万卢比。在这期间，美国的投资比例上升最快，从三亿九千七百六十万卢比增加到五亿九千八百五十万卢比，即增加了50％。英国从原来的三十七亿六千八百十万卢比，增加到三十九亿八千零三十万卢比，增加了5.6％。
    据公报透露，每年有大量外国私人资本利润流出印度。在1958年流出的二亿四千四百万卢比总数中，外国石油公司送回国去的利润就多达二亿一千八百万卢比。
    “经济周刊”在6月份的一期特刊中说，从直到目前为止所缔结的一些协定来看，很清楚，外国资本和技术援助流入印度后在印度市场上进行剥削。这家周刊指出，这些协定大多数禁止得到外国合作者援助和用外国商号的名义在印度制造的物件出口。据这家周刊说，这种同外国合作的制度的缺点包括：“辅助生产者也被迫同有名气的外国公司达成技术合作协定”。因为同外国合作的工业拒绝使用本地制造的零件；“有关工业仍然受外国合作者的控制”，“根据这种制度，所获得的技术知识不得利用来创办独立的单位”；“在设计和建造工厂和机器方面，不想让印度人受到训练”。
