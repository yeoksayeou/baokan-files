Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The Beijing Railway Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a worker paper presentation meeting, where thirty-seven workers read their papers.

These train drivers, stokers, boiler workers, track maintenance workers, loaders, and odd-job workers, in their articles, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze problems in production, explore the laws of production movements, summarize the experiences of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, elevate production practice to theory, and then use theory to guide their production practice.

This lively worker paper presentation meeting lasted for five days, with more than 600 railway workers participating. More than 130,000 employees of this bureau participated in theoretical study, and in the first half of this year, more than 70,000 employees wrote an average of nearly two papers each.

Shi Hengchang, a veteran worker and car inspector at the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Depot, read his paper "Grasping Objective Laws, Giving Full Play to Subjective Initiative, and Ensuring Safe Transportation" at the meeting. This paper used the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to summarize his experience of thirteen years of car inspection without any accidents. He said that a car inspector is like a vehicle doctor. To know why a vehicle has an accident, one must first feel the vehicle's "pulse," find the root cause of the disease, and prescribe the right medicine to prevent accidents. He pointed out that specific things must be specifically analyzed. Car inspectors must master the different characteristics of various types of vehicles, pay attention to what different accidents may occur in different sections, and carry out their work according to the changes caused by climate changes on the axles. Car inspectors, in analyzing and grasping these particularities of contradictions, have only taken the first step in eliminating accidents. They must also adopt different methods according to the objective laws for different natures of contradictions, and give full play to people's subjective initiative to ensure safety. Chen Enting, an apprentice at the Cangxian Locomotive Depot, used the story of their locomotive depot using a coal loader to discuss the relationship between knowledge and practice in his paper "Recognizing It Means You Can Control It."

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau have urgently demanded to use theory to guide their production practice and have generally carried out theoretical study. Now, under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, the bureau's employees have established more than 8,000 theoretical study groups. Now workers not only learn theory and use theory, but also talk extensively about theory and write theoretical articles extensively. Most of the more than 135,000 articles they wrote in the first half of this year were read at paper presentation meetings held by the railway bureau and its affiliated units.

    把实践经验上升为理论　用理论来指导生产实践
    北京铁路工人举行论文报告会
    三十七位工人在会上宣读了自己的论文
    新华社27日讯　中共北京铁路局委员会最近举行工人论文报告会，三十七位工人在会上宣读了他们的论文。
    这些火车司机、司炉、锅炉工、养路工、装卸工以及勤杂工，在自己的文章中，以毛泽东思想为武器，分析生产中的问题，摸索生产运动的规律，总结技术革新和技术革命运动的经验，把生产实践上升为理论，又使理论转过来指导自己的生产实践。
    这个生动活泼的工人论文报告会，共举行了五天，有六百多名铁路职工参加了报告会。这个局参加理论学习的职工有十三万多人，今年上半年有七万多名职工平均每人写出了将近两篇论文。
  　石家庄车辆段检车员、老工人史恒昌在会上宣读了他写的“掌握客观规律，充分发挥主观能动性，确保安全运输”的论文，这篇论文运用辩证唯物主义观点，总结了他自己检车十三年没有发生事故的经验。他说，检车工好比是车辆医生，要想知道车辆为什么发生事故，首先得摸车辆的“脉搏”，找出病根，对症下药，才能防止事故。他指出具体事物必须进行具体分析。检车工必须掌握各种不同类型车辆的不同特点，注意不同区间可能会发生什么不同事故，并且按照气候变化对车轴所引起的变化进行自己的工作。检车工在分析和掌握了矛盾的这些特殊性，只是为消灭事故走了第一步，还必须根据客观规律，对不同性质的矛盾采取不同的方法，充分发挥人的主观能动性，才能确保安全。沧县机务段徒工陈恩庭以“认识它就能操纵它”为题，通过他们机务段使用加煤机的故事，论述了认识和实践的关系。
    1958年大跃进以后，北京铁路局的工人们迫切要求用理论来指导自己的生产实践，普遍地进行理论学习。现在，全局职工在各级党组织领导下，已经成立了八千多个理论学习小组。现在工人们不仅学理论，用理论，而且大讲理论，大写理论文章。他们在今年上半年所写的十三万五千多篇文章，大多在铁路局及其所属各单位举行的论文报告会上宣读。
