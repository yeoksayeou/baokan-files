    National Salt Industry Workers Learn from Huang骅, Catch Up with Huang骅

    After the People's Daily published the editorial "Learn from Huang骅 Saltworks," it encouraged all salt industry workers, and good news kept pouring in from the production of sea, lake, well, and rock salt areas. According to the materials we have obtained, "Learning from Huang骅, catching up with Huang骅, and surpassing Huang骅" has become the battle cry of various saltworks. By the end of June, the Nanbu Saltworks, Daqinghe Saltworks, Jianhe Saltworks, Bayi Saltworks, Luochao Bay Saltworks, and Tanggu Saltworks Fourth Branch in Hebei, the Shouguang and Wudi Salt Bureaus in Shandong, and some saltworks in Wendeng and Rizhao counties, the Leinan County Salt Bureau in Guangdong, and the Erlian Salt Factory in Inner Mongolia, like Huang骅 Saltworks, had completed their annual tasks half a year ahead of schedule; Nanbu, Daqinghe, and other saltworks have already surpassed Huang骅 Saltworks. Precisely because of so many good conditions, the entire raw salt production also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the first half of the year. By the end of June, the national raw salt output had completed 61.09% of the annual plan, an increase of more than one-third compared with the same period last year. Hebei Province took the lead and has completed 89.97%. Provinces such as Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Qinghai have all realized the heroic slogan of "not weak in the off-season, and even stronger in the peak season."

    At present, the national salt industry workers are advancing with a hundredfold confidence, building on their victories, striving for a greater harvest, and struggling to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the national plan.

    全国盐业职工学黄骅赶黄骅
    人民日报发表了“向黄骅盐场看齐”的社论后，鼓舞了全体盐业职工，海、湖、井、矿盐区的生产，捷报不断传来。根据我们获得的材料来看，“学黄骅、赶黄骅、超黄骅”已成为各个盐场的战斗口号。到6月底止，河北的南堡盐场、大清河盐场、涧河盐场、八一盐场、落潮湾盐场、塘沽盐场四分场、山东的寿光、无棣盐局，和文登、日照等县的部分盐场，广东的雷南县盐局、内蒙的二连盐厂等，都像黄骅盐场一样，提前半年完成了全年任务；南堡、大清河等盐场已经超过了黄骅盐场。正因为有这样许多好条件，整个原盐生产上半年也获得了空前的大丰收，到6月底止，全国原盐产量已经完成全年计划61.09％，比去年同期增长三分之一以上。河北省一马当先，已完成89.97％。福建、广东、山西、陕西、青海等省，都实现了淡季不淡，旺季更旺的豪迈口号。
    目前，全国盐业职工正以百倍的信心，乘胜前进，为争取更大的丰收，为保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
