    "Give an Inch, Take a Mile"
    Lü Shufang, Worker at Harbin Xinfeng Processing Factory

    The saying "give an inch, take a mile" describes the endless demands of a person. People often use this phrase to describe those with individualistic thoughts, saying they are "greedy and insatiable."

    In fact, the meaning of this phrase goes far beyond that. Take the technical innovations and technical revolution centered on the "Four Modernizations," for example. When operating manually, we want to engage in semi-mechanization and mechanization; after realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization, we want to engage in semi-automation and automation; after realizing automation, we still want to engage in "three remotes" (remote control, remote measurement, and remote adjustment)... This kind of continuous improvement and continuous leap forward is precisely "giving an inch, taking a mile." However, the "giving an inch, taking a mile" mentioned here is different from the "giving an inch, taking a mile" in people's minds. That "giving an inch, taking a mile" is "giving" an inch of individualism and "taking" a mile of individualism. The "giving an inch, taking a mile" we are talking about here refers to constantly moving forward in order to rapidly build socialism. This kind of "giving an inch, taking a mile" should be greatly promoted.

    The Municipal Party Committee's proposal to us to vigorously promote "Four Modernizations" upgrades is to ask us to move forward continuously. Only in this way can we continuously improve labor productivity. Our workshop is like this: the pre-shearing machine used in the past was operated manually, then it was changed to mechanization, and then the single machine was connected to an automatic production line. The manpower was reduced from the original thirteen people to three to six people, and the labor productivity was greatly improved. The workers said happily: "Automation is really good, saving labor and increasing efficiency."

    At this time, is it still necessary to "take a mile"? Some people say: "Almost there," "reached the top." However, the vast majority of people believe: "In the past, people carried the sheet, now machines do it, and in the future, it will be done automatically." These people are not satisfied with the "inch" they have already gained, they still want to "take a mile." Sure enough, in the "Four Modernizations" upgrade, they changed the automatic line to remote control, so that the original two automatic lines, more than 160 links of action, were merged into automatic completion, which can not only produce more than a dozen varieties of goods, but also reduce the manpower from the original three to six people to one person. At present, they are moving towards newer technologies.

    Those who think "almost there," "reached the top," and therefore no longer want to "take a mile," are obviously satisfied with the achievements they have already made. This kind of satisfaction with the existing "inch," and therefore not wanting to "take a mile," is an obstacle to our continued progress. It becomes an obstacle because it no longer wants to continue moving forward. We oppose this stagnant right-leaning conservative thinking and advocate "giving an inch, taking a mile." In order to make the technical innovation and technical revolution centered on the "Four Modernizations" develop extensively and deeply, and in order to continuously improve labor productivity, we must not only "give an inch, take a mile," but also "give an inch, take a yard," and constantly "take yards."

    “得寸进尺”
    哈尔滨新风加工厂工人　吕树芳
    “得寸进尺”这句话，说的是人的要求，永远也没有满足的时候，人们爱用这句话来形容有个人主义思想的人，说他们是“得寸进尺，贪得无厌”。
    其实，这句话的意思远非如此。就拿以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命来说，在手工操作的时候，我们要搞半机械化、机械化；实现了半机械化、机械化，我们要搞半自动化、自动化；实现了自动化，我们还要搞“三遥”……。这种不断提高、不断跃进，也正是“得寸进尺”。不过这里说的“得寸进尺”，和平常人们心目中的那个“得寸进尺”不同，那个“得寸进尺”，是“得”个人主义之“寸”，“进”个人主义之“尺”，我们这里说的“得寸进尺”，是指为了迅速建成社会主义要不断前进。这种“得寸进尺”是要大大发扬的。
    市委向我们提出来的大搞“四化”升级，就是要我们不断前进，只有这样才能不断地提高劳动生产率。我们车间就是这样：过去使用的予剪机是手工操作，以后改为机械化，接着，单机又连成了自动生产线，人力由原来的十三人减少到三至六人，劳动生产率大大提高了。工人同志兴高彩烈地说：“自动化真正好，省工省力效率高”。
    到了这个时候，是否还需要“进尺”呢？有的人说：“差不多”了，“到顶”啦。但是，绝大多数人则认为：“过去人抬片，现在机械干，将来还要自动干。”这些人，没有满足已得的“寸”，他们还要“进尺”。果然，在“四化”升级中，他们将自动线改为遥控，使原来的两条自动线，一百六十多环节动作，归并为自动完成，不仅能生产十多样品种的商品，而且人力也由原来的三到六人减少到一人。目前，他们向更新的技术前进。
    那些认为“差不多”了，“到顶”了，因而不再想“进尺”的人，显然是满足于现在已得的成绩，这种满足既得的“寸”，因而不想“进尺”的思想，是我们继续前进的一种障碍。它之所以成为障碍，是因为它不想再继续前进了。我们反对这种停滞不前的右倾保守思想，提倡“得寸进尺”。为了使以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命广泛深入地开展下去，为了不断地提高劳动生产率，我们不仅要“得寸进尺”，而且要“得寸进丈”，要不断地“进丈”。
