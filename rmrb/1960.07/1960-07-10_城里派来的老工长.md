The Old Foreman Sent from the City

    Recently, the universal feed pulverizers produced by our factory will be transported to various livestock farms for use. The fact that we can manufacture such complex machines is mainly due to the help of our worker elder brothers. Once, the Party Secretary of the Beijing Bus Factory came to our commune for a visit. Upon hearing that we lacked technical strength, he immediately sent an old foreman, Li Ling, from the city. As soon as he arrived at the commune, without a word, he went to the workshop to work. One day, he saw a "pestle rammer" lying unused in the yard and said, "It's such a waste to leave such a good thing idle!" He then discussed with us how to make use of it. It just so happened that we were making the shell of the pulverizer at that time, and it was too laborious to cut iron plates by hand. It took three people a whole day to cut only thirty-six pieces. He voluntarily helped us convert this waste machine into an electric iron shearing machine. This was great! We could now cut more than 1,100 iron plates a day without any effort! He stayed with us for more than ten days, and whenever he saw areas that needed improvement, he would voluntarily offer suggestions and take action to modify them. Although he has been away from the commune for a long time now, we still miss him!

    城里派来的老工长
    最近，我们厂生产的万能饲料粉碎机就要运到各个畜牧场去使用了。我们能制造出这样复杂的机器，主要是有工人老大哥的帮助。有一次，北京客车厂的党委书记来公社参观，听说我们技术力量不足，立刻就从城里派来了一位老工长李凌。他一到公社，二话没说，就下车间干活。一天，他看到院子里放着一台“捣子”没人使用，就说：“这样好的东西闲着多可惜呀！”说着就和我们研究如何把它利用起来。正巧那时我们在作粉碎机的外壳，用手工裁铁板太费力气，三个人一天才剪三十六块，他就主动帮助我们把这台废机器改成了电动剪铁机。这下可好了，一天能剪铁板一千一百多块，还不费劲！他在我们这儿住了十几天，看到哪些地方需要改进，就主动提意见动手改。现在他虽然离开公社很久了，但我们一直想念他！
