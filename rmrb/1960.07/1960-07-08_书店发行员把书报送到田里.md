Bookstore Distributors Deliver Books and Newspapers to the Fields

The bookstore branches of various communes in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, have actively responded to the municipal and county Party committees' call to "support agriculture in all trades and professions." Closely coordinating with the "high yield and bumper harvest" campaign, they work closely with local post offices, film projection teams, and cultural centers, cooperating with each other to facilitate the masses, expand service projects, break out of the "book buying and selling" circle, and vigorously support agricultural production.

Since May, bookstore distributors have realized "wherever the commune members are, the books are there; wherever there are readers, there are books." During labor, the book distributor of Tangfang Bookstore learned that some commune members lacked technical knowledge and were worried that the newly reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of rice paddies would not yield high yields and bumper harvests. They rushed to the county bookstore overnight and delivered more than 230 copies of technical books on rice management to the commune members. The production team immediately organized the commune members to study, helping the commune members overcome the technical difficulties in rice management and enhancing the commune members' confidence in achieving a high yield of rice.

During the day, bookstore distributors participate in production and distribute books on construction sites and in the fields. In the evening, they help the film projection teams sell tickets and check tickets. Sometimes, when transporting books to the county, they also exchange and collect films for the film projection teams. This frees up the projectionists to help the production teams operate and repair irrigation and drainage machinery. This not only solves the current contradiction between the large number of power machines and the shortage of technical personnel in the production team, but also cultivates technical talents for the production team. Tangfang Commune alone has trained more than 30 irrigation and drainage technicians for the production team.

Whenever the bookstore receives new books, the cultural center makes slides to introduce the contents of the new books. The film projection team takes the opportunity before the screening to recommend and promote the books to the audience. After the new books are released, the distributors cooperate with the staff of the cultural center to carry out reading activities. The Fourth Production Team of Zhongmen Commune, through reading books and newspapers, adopted a new method of cultivating sweet potatoes. As a result, the seedlings of 30 mu of sweet potatoes were more complete, neater, and stronger than those cultivated by the old method.

    书店发行员把书报送到田里
    河北丰润县各公社书店积极响应市、县委“各行各业支援农业”的战斗号召，紧密配合“丰产丰收”运动，与各地邮局、电影队、文化馆密切协作，互相配合，便利了群众，扩大了服务项目，跳出了“图书买卖”圈子，有力地支援了农业生产。
    5月份以来，各书店发行员实现了“社员在哪里，图书就到哪里，哪里有读者，哪里就有图书。”唐坊书店图书发行员在劳动中了解到有些社员缺乏技术，担心新开垦的两万亩多稻田不能丰产丰收，他们星夜赶到县书店，把二百三十多册管理水稻的技术书籍，送到社员手里，生产队就马上组织社员学习，帮助社员闯过了管理水稻的技术关，增强了社员对水稻丰产必胜信心。
    书店发行员在白天深入工地田间参加生产，发行图书，到晚上就帮着电影队卖票、检票。有时到县里运书，还为电影队换片，取片。这样就使放映员腾出手脚，帮助生产队操纵和修理排灌水利机械。不但解决了生产队当前动力机多，技术人员少的矛盾，还为生产队培养了技术人材。仅唐坊公社就为生产队培养了三十多名排灌技术员。
    每逢书店到了新书，文化馆就制幻灯片介绍新书内容。电影队就借放映前的机会，向广大观众进行推荐宣传。新书发行以后，发行员配合文化馆人员开展读书活动。中门社第四生产队由于通过阅读书报，采取了新法栽培白薯，结果三十亩白薯比旧法栽培的苗全、苗齐、苗茁壮。
