Unification of Variety and Output Value
Wang Pu

In socialist enterprises, completing the variety plan and completing the output value plan are consistent. Even producing products with relatively low value should not hinder the completion of the variety plan.

Today's news in this newspaper about the Wenzhou Organic Chemical Factory in Zhejiang and the Shanghai mechanical industry proves this truth. Both of these units produced varieties that some people once thought would hinder the growth of output value, but what was the result? Their variety plans and output value plans were both completed very well.

Variety and output value are consistent. Those who believe that producing varieties with low output value makes it difficult to complete the output value plan probably have incorrect views on how to calculate output value. Is output value viewed from a global perspective, or from a local perspective? Is it viewed from a temporary perspective, or from a long-term perspective? These are two completely different viewpoints.

From a local and temporary perspective of an enterprise, the growth of output value from producing products with relatively low output value is indeed not as good as producing products with relatively high output value. However, from a global and long-term perspective, it is different. Take the basic organic chemical raw materials produced by the Wenzhou Organic Chemical Factory, for example. These are raw materials for the chemical industry and are the products most urgently needed by the state. Mass production of these products can support the great development of the entire chemical industry. Although it is more difficult for factories producing these products to achieve a large increase in output value, they create conditions for other chemical factories to greatly increase their output value. Similarly, in the machinery industry, if every factory only produces large, high-value products, and does not produce those low-value products that are urgently needed for national construction, the products will not be complete sets. Then, the large products will not be able to play their due role, and basic construction units will not be able to put this equipment into production to create new value.

If factories produce both large products and small products, producing them in complete sets, although the growth of output value from a local perspective is not as good as producing only large products, the basic construction units can immediately put such complete sets of products into production after receiving them, and can immediately use these devices to create new value for the country. Therefore, from a global and long-term perspective, producing products needed by the state with relatively low unit value not only does not hinder the large growth of output value, but is also indispensable for promoting the large growth of output value. Every enterprise should put the global and long-term interests first and consciously and resolutely organize production according to the varieties needed by the state.

Does this mean that the output value plan is dispensable? Of course not. Output value is also one of the indicators for measuring how much wealth an enterprise creates for the country and how much value workers create for the country. However, completing the output value plan is not equal to completing the product plan. Therefore, the working class must always consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, proceed from the needs of the country in everything, produce whatever the country needs, and produce as much as needed. Completing the national production plan is an extremely serious matter, and we must not take shortcuts for convenience. Pursuing output value while deviating from the needs of the country is a manifestation of lacking a global perspective. We should unify variety and output value, and strive to meet the needs of the country in terms of variety and quantity, just like the Wenzhou Organic Chemical Factory in Zhejiang and the Shanghai mechanical industry system. This is the global perspective and the principle of the whole country acting as one chess game that we advocate.

### 品种和产值的统一

    品种和产值的统一
    王朴
    在社会主义企业里，完成品种计划和完成产值计划是一致的，即使生产价值比较低的产品，也不能妨碍品种计划的完成。
    今天本报发表的浙江温州有机化工厂和上海机械工业的新闻就证明了这个真理。这两个单位都生产了曾经被一些人认为是妨碍产值增长的品种，但结果呢？他们的品种计划和产值计划都完成得很好。
    品种和产值是一致的。那种认为生产产值低的品种就不好完成产值计划的人，恐怕对怎样计算产值有不正确的看法。是从全局的观点来看产值呢？还是从局部的观点来看，是从暂时的观点来看呢？还是从长远的观点来看？这是两种截然不同的观点。
    从一个企业局部的、暂时的观点看，生产那些产值比较低的产品，产值的增长的确比不上生产那些产值比较高的产品。但是，从全局和长远的观点来看，就不同。拿温州有机化工厂生产的有机化工基本原料来讲吧，这是化学工业的原料，是国家最急需的产品，大量生产这种产品，就能够支援整个化学工业的大发展。生产这种产品的工厂，虽然产值的大增长比较困难，却为其他许多化工厂产值的大幅度增长创造了条件。又如机械工业，如果每一个工厂都生产大件的产值高的产品，而不生产那些产值比较低的，但国家建设十分需要的产品，产品不成套，那么大件产品就不能发挥应有的作用，基本建设单位拿到这些设备，就不能投入生产创造新的价值。
    如果工厂既生产大件产品，又生产小件产品，一套一套的生产，虽然从局部看，产值的增长不如全生产大件的产品，但基本建设单位拿到了这样成套的产品以后，却能够马上投入生产，能够马上利用这些设备为国家创造新的价值。所以，从全局和长远的观点看，生产国家所需要的、单位价值比较低的产品，不但不妨碍产值的大增长，而且正是促进产值大增长所必不可缺少的。每一个企业都应当把全局的、长远的利益摆在第一位，自觉地坚决地按照国家需要的品种组织生产。
    这么说，难道产值计划就可有可无吗？当然不是。产值也是衡量一个企业为国家创造多少财富，衡量工人为国家创造多少价值的标志之一。但完成产值计划，不等于完成产品计划，所以，工人阶级要时刻顾大局，识大体，处处从国家的需要出发，国家需要什么就生产什么，需要多少生产多少，完成国家生产计划，是一件极其严肃的事，不能图方便，走捷径。离开国家需要而追求产值，是缺少全局观点的一种表现。我们应当把品种和产值统一起来，既要在品种方面尽量满足国家需要，又要在数量方面尽量满足国家需要，就像浙江温州有机化工厂和上海机械工业系统那样。这就是我们所提倡的全局观点和全国一盘棋原则。
