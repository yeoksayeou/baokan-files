Latin American People Issue Stern Warning to U.S. Imperialism:
    Invading Cuba is Invading the Entire Latin America
Cuba and Venezuelan Trade Unions Sign Agreement of Solidarity and Mutual Assistance; Argentine Trade Unions Decide to Launch a Movement to Support Cuba
Tens of Thousands Rally in Chilean Capital to Condemn U.S. Interference in Cuba; Costa Rica to Hold Conference Protesting U.S. Aggression

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, July 19th: Last night, the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation signed an agreement of solidarity and mutual assistance at the Trade Union Building in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. The agreement was signed by José González Navarro and Bernardo Pérez Salinas on behalf of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, and by Jesús Soto and Faustino Calcines on behalf of the Cuban Workers' Confederation. The agreement stated:

The only historic agreement in the current stage of history for the Latin American proletariat organizations includes the following points:

    1.  In the event of any sudden situation where domestic or foreign forces conspire to threaten the sovereignty of the peoples of the two countries, the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation will use their respective material and human resources to take the revolutionary actions necessary to ensure the democratic achievements and development of the workers of both countries.

    2.  The trade unions of the two countries unanimously agree that if either country is subjected to foreign aggression, they must provide volunteers from their member organizations to carry out joint self-defense.

    3.  Unanimous agreement should form such a basic awareness among the working class: in the event of foreign or domestic attacks that infringe on the democratic system, general strikes will even be declared for defense, mutual solidarity and support.

    4.  When any of the trade unions of the two countries that have signed the agreement is under obvious threat and it is necessary, the trade unions of the two countries will mobilize the strength of the masses to provide support.

    5.  The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation and the Cuban Workers' Confederation call on trade unions in Latin American countries and international trade union organizations to adopt the same attitude of mutual support, which is a guarantee for the bright future of the people and working masses of Latin American countries.

    6.  If a government instigates or launches an aggression against Cuba or Venezuela, the products of that country will be boycotted, and the export of any commodities to the aggressor country will be refused.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, July 18th: The Argentine "Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement" issued a statement stating that it will launch extensive activities to support the Cuban people and their government.

The "Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement," which represents two hundred trade union organizations and more than one million workers, said in a statement, "The 'Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement' will launch a broad movement within the working class to support Cuba, such as collecting tens of millions of signatures in enterprises, factories, and workshops, holding conferences, etc."

The statement expressed opposition to the Argentine government's recent interventionist note to Cuba, which, under the pretext of so-called Soviet "interference" in American affairs, demanded that the Cuban government reject Soviet support. The statement said that Argentine workers "will never support the Foreign Ministry's note. On the contrary, they reaffirm that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the people of Latin America and the world and is the exploiter of all countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, July 17th: The Popular Action Front of Chile held a mass rally in Santiago today, attended by 10,000 people. The conference unanimously expressed its support for the Cuban revolution and condemned the United States for instigating the convocation of a meeting of the Organization of American States to plot further interference in Cuba.

Allende, chairman of the Popular Action Front and senator, spoke at the meeting. He said: If imperialism extends its claws to Cuba, we will call on Chilean dockworkers, copper miners, iron ore miners, nitrate miners, students, teachers, staff, and all salaried workers across the country to defend the Cuban revolution. At the same time, we will declare that any aggression against Cuba is an aggression against the entire Latin America and also an aggression against the Chilean people.

Allende praised the Cuban people's resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. He said that Cuba has pointed out the path to a new future for all of Latin America.

Orlando Millas, member of the Political Committee of the Chilean Communist Party, said in his speech that Latin America has undergone fundamental changes and has ushered in an era in which this continent can decide its own destiny and get rid of the shackles of U.S. imperialism. This new stage can be confirmed in Cuba. The reason why this new stage can arrive is: the Cuban people are united under the leadership of the revolutionary government; they have the support of the people of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, San José, July 18th: The Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution in Costa Rica sent a telegram to Cuban Prime Minister Castro at a meeting held on the 16th, expressing support for the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and condemning U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The telegram stated that the people of Costa Rica believe that aggression against Cuba is harming the entire Latin America and is an infringement on the right to self-determination.

The meeting also elected a new leading body for the Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution. Representatives of the various political parties and the Costa Rican General Confederation of Trade Unions participating in the new leadership body will begin preparations for a mass rally scheduled to be held on July 26th to protest against U.S. imperialist aggression.

The Costa Rican "Forward" newspaper recently published an article demanding that Latin American countries not accept the share of exporting more sugar to the United States obtained by reducing Cuba's import quota. The newspaper pointed out that in imperialist aggression, the people of a fraternal country should not be sacrificed for self-interest.

    智利首都万人集会谴责美国干涉古巴　哥斯达黎加将举行抗议美国侵略大会
    新华社加拉加斯19日电　昨天晚上，古巴工人联合会和委内瑞拉工人联合会在委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的工会大厦签订了一项团结互助协议，这项协议是由何塞·冈萨雷斯·纳瓦罗和贝尔纳多·佩雷兹·萨利纳斯代表委内瑞拉工人联合会，与赫苏斯·索托和福斯蒂诺·卡尔西内斯代表古巴工人联合会签署的。协议中说：
    拉丁美洲无产阶级组织现阶段历史中的唯一历史性协议包括下列各点：
    一、当出现国内外力量策动的使两国人民的主权受到威胁的任何突变形势时，古巴工人联合会和委内瑞拉工人联合会将利用双方的物质力量和人力采取事变所需要的革命行动，保证两国工人所取得的民主成果及其发展。
    二、两国的工人联合会一致协议，一旦两国中的任何一国遭受外国侵略时，必须从它们的会员机构中提供志愿者，进行共同的自卫。
    三、一致协议应在工人阶级中形成这样的基本觉悟：在发生侵犯民主制度的国外或国内的进攻时，为了进行防卫，甚至将宣布总罢工，互相声援和支持。
    四、当签订协议的两国工人联合会的任何一国受到明显的威胁而有必要时，两国工人联合会将动员群众的力量予以支援。
    五、委内瑞拉工人联合会和古巴工人联合会号召拉丁美洲各国工会和国际工会组织也同样采取这种互相支援的态度，这种互相支援是拉丁美洲各国人民和劳动群众的美好未来的保证。
    六、如果一国政府嗾使或发动对古巴或委内瑞拉的侵略，则对这个国家的产品进行抵制，并且拒绝向侵略国运出任何商品。
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯18日电　阿根廷“工会团结合作运动”发表声明，表示将展开广泛的活动来支持古巴人民及其政府。
    代表着二百个工会组织和一百多万工人的“工会团结合作运动”在声明中说，“‘工会团结合作运动’将在工人阶级内部发动一次支援古巴的广泛的运动，如在企业、工厂和工场征集千万个签名，举行大会等等。”
    声明表示反对阿根廷政府最近向古巴提出的干涉性的照会，这个照会以所谓苏联“干涉”美洲事务为借口，要求古巴政府拒绝苏联的支持。声明说，阿根廷工人“永远不会支持外交部的照会。相反，他们重申，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的主要敌人，是各国人民的剥削者。”
    据新华社圣地亚哥17日电　智利人民行动阵线今天在圣地亚哥举行了有一万人参加的群众大会。大会一致表示支持古巴革命，并且谴责美国策动召开美洲国家组织会议来策划进一步干涉古巴的阴谋。
    人民行动阵线主席、参议员阿伦德在会上讲了话。他说：假如帝国主义把它的魔爪伸向古巴，我们将号召智利的码头工人、铜矿工人、铁矿工人、硝石工人、学生、教师、职员和全国所有的工薪人员来保卫古巴革命。同时，我们将宣布，对古巴的任何侵略，就是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略，也是对智利人民的侵略。
    阿伦德赞扬古巴人民反对美帝国主义的坚决斗争。他说，古巴为全拉丁美洲指出了通向一个新的未来的道路。
    智利共产党政治委员会委员奥尔兰多·米利亚斯在讲话中说，拉丁美洲已经发生了根本的变化，并且揭开了本大陆自己决定自己命运和摆脱美帝国主义束缚的时代。这个新阶段可以在古巴得到证实。这个新阶段之所以能到来，是由于：古巴人民在革命政府领导下团结一致；他们得到世界各国人民的支持。
    据新华社圣约瑟18日电　哥斯达黎加的古巴革命之友协会在16日举行的会议上致电古巴总理卡斯特罗，表示支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，并且谴责美国干涉古巴的内政。电文说，哥斯达黎加人民认为，侵略古巴就是伤害整个拉丁美洲和对自决权的侵犯。
    会上还选举了古巴革命之友协会的新的领导机构。参加新领导机构的各政党和哥斯达黎加总工会的代表将开始筹备预定在7月26日举行的抗议美帝国主义侵略的群众大会。
    哥斯达黎加“前进报”最近发表文章，要求拉丁美洲各国不要接受因削减古巴食糖的进口份额而获得的向美国输出更多的糖的份额。报纸指出，在帝国主义的侵略中，不应该牺牲一个兄弟国家的人民而取利自肥。
