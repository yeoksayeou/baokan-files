Third March
——Mount Everest Diary
Athlete Shi Jing
April 25 (5,400 meters)
	After breakfast, our detachment sorted out equipment to the base camp, and received some more advanced cold-resistant equipment and technical equipment. The down jackets and storm jackets have been replaced three times, each time with higher quality; the woolen sweaters, woolen socks, and gloves are all custom-made, with ample means to defend against the severe cold of the high mountains. How can we not be grateful for the Party's care and the support of the people across the country?
	In the afternoon, the five-star red flag fluttered in the exercise field, and dozens of us team members held a vigorous and high-spirited departure meeting for the third march here. Director Han encouraged all team members at the meeting to establish lofty ambitions and great aspirations, muster greater enthusiasm, and contribute their greatest strength to conquering Mount Everest. The captain, representing all team members, stated: Wherever the Party directs, we will fight! We will definitely overcome difficulties and guarantee the completion of the mission. I used a 16mm camera for the first time to capture this meaningful scene on film.
	The team set off, and although everyone was carrying 25 kilograms, the marching speed was very fast. When we reached the East Rongbuk Glacier, everyone suggested taking the scree slope with a gradient of over 60 degrees and the glacial slope of about 200 meters to show the unit's vigor. Sure enough, we passed through this dangerous area in twenty minutes. Two and a half hours later, we safely reached Camp One at an altitude of 5,400 meters.
April 26
(6,400 meters)
	According to the weather forecast and in order to gain time to climb the peak, the team decided to rush to two camps today. Therefore, the marching speed was particularly fast. In relatively flat areas, we were practically jogging, with the new team members struggling to catch up behind. Before two o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Camp Two at 5,900 meters.
	After resting at Camp Two for an hour, we continued to move forward. As usual, a strong wind started blowing in the afternoon, and the wind grew stronger and stronger. The road became increasingly difficult to walk. The wind-blown snow pellets stung our faces, and visibility gradually shortened. Beyond a dozen meters, everything was white. At this time, we had to rely on the mountaineering knowledge and experience of the trailblazers, and everyone followed their footprints in single file, leaning sideways to avoid the wind and snow, advancing with difficulty. Some people fell, patted the snow off their bodies, and hurried to catch up. When we arrived at Camp Three at 7:00 PM, the personnel stationed there had already boiled tea for us. Everyone crawled into the tents that were swaying in the wind, and it was very warm inside.
April 28
(6,950 meters)
	We set off at 10:00 AM today. Our group was at the front. When we reached the intermediate camp at 6,950 meters, the tents we had pitched during the last march had been torn by the wind, leaving only a few pieces of canvas, flying like small flags in the wind. When climbing the steep slopes of over 60 degrees up the North Col, we all felt that it was easier and faster than last time.
	When climbing the most difficult "Ice Gully" on the North Col, everyone had to climb up the ladders with great effort. It took the experienced team members ten minutes to pass this obstacle, while the transportation team members, carrying too much weight and lacking technical skills, often took thirty or forty minutes for one person to climb up. It gradually got dark, and it was almost impossible to see your fingers. Liu Lianman, Wang Fuzhou, and Zhang Junyan's group were successively dispatched to meet the transportation team members. It was not until 3:00 AM that everyone climbed the "Ice Gully" and camped for rest. Truly, the "Ice Gully" was so difficult to climb!
April 29
(7,400 meters)
	We continued to climb upwards today. Upon reaching the top of the North Col, I quickly took out the 35mm camera that I had left here during the last march from the snow cave, adding more than five kilograms of burden. The team climbed southward along the snow cornice of the North Col ridge. The steeper the slope, the looser the ice and snow. In some sections, you would slip back half a step for every step you took. A little carelessness would cause you to slide down several meters. This tested not only your physical strength but also your willpower.
	In the afternoon, the high-altitude wind gradually increased. As we approached the junction of rock and ice snow, the high-altitude wind exceeded Level 12. Whirlwinds, like pillars, rolled up snow particles and rampaged. Coming across one meant everything was over. The wind was strong, breathing was difficult, and advancing was dangerous, but we could not stop or retreat. We could only advance in groups. People lay down and used all their strength to insert ice axes into the ice and snow for protection. One person bent over, took a deep breath, and charged forward for a dozen meters, then the other three took turns to charge forward. In this way, we advanced only two hundred meters in over an hour.
	Ahead was another steep rocky slope. The wind was too strong to advance, so we decided to camp for rest. As soon as the tent was set up, it was blown down. It took a great deal of effort to finally set up two low tents close to the ground to barely shelter from the wind and snow. The other two groups had no place to set up tents and had to drill into ice cracks to build two snow caves for shelter. At this time, many comrades' hands and feet were numb, and their noses were frozen.
May 1
(7,800 meters)
	Today is the great festival of working people all over the world. In the morning, I thought for a long time, thought about the joyous celebration of the people in the capital, thought about Tiananmen Square, thought about our beloved Chairman Mao... I also thought that I had accepted the Party's instructions and the entrustment of 650 million people, and was advancing towards Mount Everest at 7,800 meters. I immediately felt energized and proud to be able to undertake the task of conquering Mount Everest.
	Although the wind was still around Level 7 today, the task was urgent, so we continued to climb the rocks at 10:00 AM on this festive morning. The first group became Liu Lianman, Gonbu, Laba, and myself. Lianman led the way, sometimes climbing vertically, sometimes cutting diagonally across rocky slopes and cliffs, sometimes climbing with both hands and feet. Around 6:00 PM, we reached 7,800 meters. British explorers failed to escape their fate here. Their old campsite was littered with a large number of rotten equipment, such as tents, sleeping bags, clothing, food, and other messy things.
May 2
(8,100 meters)
	Another day of marching, and it was midnight when we arrived at the high-altitude camp at 8,100 meters. The tents were set up on a rocky slope, and one-third of the tent floor was still hanging in the air, swaying. Six people couldn't sleep in one tent, so everyone squeezed together to sit. Our stomachs were rumbling with hunger. If we couldn't eat, let's boil some water, but the mountain was high and the air was thin, and a match wouldn't light. Two or three matches together would strike, then go out with a "hiss." Two and a half boxes of matches were used up, and the gas stove still wouldn't light. After checking, the second group had some fried flour left. Some comrades swallowed a few mouthfuls to satisfy their hunger, which made them even thirstier. Everyone simply ignored it and closed their eyes to doze off.
May 3
(8,500 meters)
	When I woke up, I felt pretty good, and we set off immediately. The six people were divided into two groups to advance. Lao Shi, Wang Fengtong, and Laba were in one group, and Xu Jing, Gonbu, and I were in another group. Today, almost all of the climbing was vertical. The weathered cliffs were severe, and icy slopes and cliffs blocked our path one after another. Fatigue and lack of oxygen made our progress even more difficult. We had to rest every three to five steps.
	As the sun was setting, we reached 8,500 meters and decided to set up the last assault camp in the middle of three large rocks. At this time, Gonbu and I hadn't started using oxygen yet. We were going to use oxygen only when we needed it most, and we were prepared to continue climbing upwards.
May 4
	I was in a daze all night. When I woke up at 8:00 AM, I asked Gonbu how he felt. He said he was fine, so he sorted out his backpack and continued to go and meet the two people in the first group. While climbing along the ridge, we encountered a cliff of a dozen meters that was impossible to pass. Gonbu and I discussed it and decided to cut diagonally across the north slope. Just as we were about to go around the ridge, Captain Shi and Wang Fengtong came down in a group. I suggested continuing to climb upwards, but Captain Shi said that they had already scouted the route for attacking the main peak and had over-fulfilled their set task. So it was decided that both groups would retreat to the base camp for rest, preparing for the fourth march to attack the main peak.

    第三次行军
    ——登珠穆朗玛峰日记
    运动健将　石竞
    四月二十五日（五千四百米处）
    早饭后，我们分队整理装备到大本营，又领了一些更高级的耐寒装备与技术装备。鸭绒衣、冲锋衣已经换过三次了，一次比一次质量高；毛线衣、毛线袜和手套都是特制的，完全有本钱防御高山严寒，怎能不感激党的关怀和全国人民的支援呢。
    下午，操场上五星红旗飘扬，我们几十个队员雄赳赳气昂昂地在这里举行第三次行军出征大会。韩司长在会上鼓励全体队员，树雄心、立大志，鼓足更大干劲，为征服珠穆朗玛峰而贡献自己的最大力量。队长代表全体队员表示：党指到哪里，我们战斗到哪里，一定克服困难，保证完成任务。我第一次用十六毫米的摄影机把这个有意义的场面摄入了镜头。
    整队出发了，虽然每人都负重二十五公斤，可是行军速度很快。到东绒布口时，都提意见要走六十度以上的碎石坡和二百米左右的冰川斜坡，以显示部队的锐气。果然二十分钟就通过了这个艰险地带。两个半小时以后，我们就安全到达拔海五千四百米的第一号营地。
    四月二十六日
    （六千四百米处）
    根据气象预报和为了争取时间攀登高峰，队部决定今天赶两个营地。所以行军速度特别快，在地势比较平坦的地方简直是小跑，新队员在后面吃力地追着。不到下午两点，我们就到了五千九百米的二号营地。
    在二号营地休息了一个小时继续前进。下午又照例起了大风，风越刮越大，路越来越难走，风吹雪粒把脸打得生疼，视线慢慢变短了，十几米以外尽是白茫茫的。这时只好凭着开路者的登山知识和经验，大家跟着他们的脚印鱼贯而行，侧着身子避着风雪艰难地前进着，有的摔倒了，拍拍身上的雪又赶了上去。当日下午七点钟到达三号营地的时候，驻在三号营地的人员已给我们烧好了茶水，大家钻进被风刮得乱晃的帐篷，里边温暖得很。
    四月二十八日
    （六千九百五十米处）
    今天十点钟出发，我们小组在最前头，到达六千九百五十米的中间营地时，上次行军搭的帐篷被大风扯得只剩下几条篷布，像小旗一样迎风飘扬。上北坳几个六十度以上的陡坡时，都感到省力速度快，比上次轻松。
    攀登北坳最困难的“冰胡同”时，都是自己沿着云梯费力地向上爬，老队员们费了十分钟才过了这道关，而运输队员背的太重，技术也差，常常是三四十分钟才上一个人。天慢慢黑下来，几乎伸手不见五指，先后派刘连满、王富洲和张俊岩小组接应运输队员，直到夜间三点才全部登上“冰胡同”安营休息。真是好难攀登的“冰胡同”呀！
    四月二十九日
    （七千四百米处）
    今天继续往上攀登。到达北坳顶部，我赶紧从雪洞里取出上次行军放在这里的三十六毫米摄影机，增加了五公斤多的负担。大队沿北坳山脊雪檐向南上攀，越上坡越陡，冰雪也越松。有的地段上一步滑半步稍不注意就滑下去几米，这里既考验你的体力，也考验你的毅力。
    下午，高空风渐渐大起来，快到岩石冰雪交接处时，高空风竟超过十二级以上。旋风像个柱子一样卷着雪粒横行霸道，碰上它一切就完了。风大，呼吸困难，前进危险，但是既不能停下来，更不能后退，只能结组前进。人们趴下用全力将冰镐插入冰雪进行保护，一个人弯着腰、鼓足气，猛力向前冲锋十几米，然后另外三人轮番向前冲进。就这样用了一个多小时才前进了二百多米。
    前面又是陡峭的岩石斜坡，风太大不能前进，决定安营休息，帐篷刚搭起就被吹垮了，费了九牛二虎之力，最后才搭起两个挨地的低帐篷勉强避风雪。另外两个组无处可搭帐篷，只得钻进冰裂缝里修了两个雪洞藏身，这时，不少同志的手足麻木，鼻子冻僵了。
    五月一日
    （七千八百米处）
    今天是全世界劳动人民的伟大节日。早晨，我想了很久，想到了首都人民节日的欢乐，想到了天安门广场，想到了亲爱的毛主席……。又想到我接受了党的指示和六亿五千万人民的委托，正在七千八百米的地方向珠穆朗玛峰前进，顿时浑身是劲，为自己能担任征服珠峰的任务而感到骄傲和自豪。
    虽然今天的风仍有七级左右，但是任务紧急，我们就在节日的早上十点钟继续向上攀登岩石了。第一组变为刘连满、贡布、拉巴和我。连满在前开路，有时垂直攀登，有时斜切岩石陡坡和峭壁，有时手脚并用向上爬行。下午六点左右，到达七千八百米处，英国探险者在这里没有逃脱失败的命运，他们的旧营址上还有大批腐坏的装备，如帐篷、睡袋、服装、食品等乱七八糟的东西。
    五月二日
    （八千一百米处）
    又是一天的行军，直到半夜才抵达八千一百米的高山营地。帐篷搭在岩石斜坡上，三分之一的帐篷底还在悬空飘摇，一个帐篷六个人没法睡，大家就挤着坐。肚子里咕噜咕噜直叫。不吃饭就烧点水喝吧，可山高空气稀薄，一根火柴点不着，两三根合在一起擦也是“哧”的一声又灭了。两盒半火柴划光了，煤汽炉也没点着。检查了一下，二组还剩一些炒面，有的同志就干咽了几口充饥，这一下更渴了，大家就干脆来个不管，闭上眼睛打磕睡。
    五月三日
   （八千五百米处）
    一觉醒来，精神还不错，马上出发。六个人分为两个结组前进，老史、王凤桐和拉巴为一组，我和许竞、贡布为一组先后出发。今天几乎都是垂直上攀，峭壁岩石风化得很厉害，冰雪陡坡和悬岩一段接一段地拦住去路，疲乏和缺氧使我们前进更增加了困难，每上三五步就得休息一下。
    太阳偏西的时候，我们到达了八千五百米处，决定在三大石中间搭起最后一个突击营地，这时我和贡布还没开始用氧呢。因为我们要在最需要的时候才吃氧，我们还准备继续向上攀登。
    五月四日
    一整夜都是恍恍惚惚，早晨八点钟起来，我问贡布反应如何，他说没什么问题，就整理背包继续前进去接第一组的两个人。沿山脊攀登，遇到一个十几米的悬岩，根本不能通过。我和贡布商量了一下，从北坡斜切攀登过去。正要绕过山脊时，史队长和王凤桐结着组向下走来，我提出继续上攀，史队长说他们已经侦察好了突击主峰的路线，超额完成了既定任务。于是决定两组都撤回大本营休整，准备第四次行军突击主峰。
