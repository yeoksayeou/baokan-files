Hangzhou, July 3rd (This newspaper) – Zhejiang Province has formed a youth and women's new agricultural tool promotion team, which has been dispatched to the four special districts of Jiaxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, and Wenzhou, as well as the suburbs of Hangzhou, to carry out activities of spreading knowledge and delivering treasures, promoting the widespread use of various new tools in the province's double-cropping rice harvest and planting.

The new agricultural tool promotion team was selected from outstanding male and female new agricultural tool experts and high-efficiency experts from all over the province. Among the one hundred model figures, there are the province's well-known young rice transplanter Yan Hongliang, female rice transplanter Sun Zaodi, and skilled operators of new tools such as large sickles, rapid harvesters, and power threshers, as well as representatives of commune party committees with significant achievements in promoting the use of new agricultural tools.

After arriving in various regions, the new agricultural tool promotion team will widely and deeply disseminate the advanced experiences of advanced units and the advanced thinking and operating techniques of model figures. They will vigorously promote new tools such as rice transplanters, large sickles, rapid harvesters, and power threshers through various activities such as operation demonstrations, on-site competitions, and symposium introductions, to promote the mass movement of vigorously carrying out tool reform in various places and better complete this year's double-cropping rice harvesting and planting tasks.

While the provincial promotion team is conducting in-depth activities, special districts, counties, and communes will also organize new agricultural tool promotion teams to tour and perform in various communes and production teams, imparting knowledge at all levels, forming a mass movement of ten thousand people promoting new agricultural tools.

Hangzhou, July 3rd (This newspaper) – Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, has organized inspection teams combining cadres, farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields, summarize experience in preventing lodging, and comprehensively launch a shock movement to vigorously overcome the problem of early rice lodging. By June 21st, all 71,000 mu of large rice fields in the county had been drained, and soil was added and fertilizer applied to 51,400 mu, with more than 95% of the fields having been dried at least twice. At present, the rice stalks are firm and growing stronger.

This year, the early rice in Huangyan County has a high planting density, sufficient base fertilizer, and meticulous management, resulting in good rice seedling growth, with widespread heading beginning, and an average of more than fifteen effective tillers per clump. However, the prominent problem is the risk of lodging in some rice seedlings. In response to this situation, the county party committee organized more than 12,400 cadres, farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields to conduct inspections and assessments, focusing on summarizing and promoting the experience of the Liangluqiao Commune's fine seed breeding farm in preventing lodging, and organizing cadres above the level of brigade party branch secretaries to conduct on-site visits, powerfully criticizing the pessimistic attitude of "large rice is easy to plant but difficult to prevent lodging."

In order to ensure the success of lodging prevention work, 2,496 specialized lodging prevention teams have been organized throughout the county, establishing a responsibility system. At present, these specialized team members are doing everything possible to do a good job in lodging prevention.

    黄岩县万人到田总结防倒伏经验
    本报杭州3日电　浙江省组成青年、妇女新式农具推广团，已分赴嘉兴、宁波、金华、温州四个专区和杭州郊区，进行传经送宝活动，促进全省连作稻抢收抢种中普遍推广使用各种新式工具。
    这次新式农具推广团是选拔全省各地优秀的男女新式农具手高工效能手组成的。在一百名标兵人物中，有全省闻名的青年插秧机手严宏良、女插秧机手孙早娣，也有使用大镰刀、快速收割器、动力打稻机等新式工具操作能手，还有推广使用新式农具有显著成绩的公社党委代表。
    新式农具推广团到各地区后，将广泛深入地传播先进单位经验和标兵人物的先进思想、先进操作技术，他们将通过操作表演、现场比武和座谈介绍等多种多样的活动，大力推广插秧机、大镰刀、快速收割器、动力打稻机等新式工具，促进各地大搞工具改革的群众运动，更好地完成今年连作稻的收种任务。
    在省推广团深入活动的同时，各专区、县和公社也将组织新式农具推广团，到各公社、生产队巡回表演，层层传授，形成万人推广新式农具的群众运动。
    本报杭州3日电　浙江省黄岩县组织干部、农民、技术员三结合的检查队伍，深入田间，总结防倒伏经验，全面开展猛攻早稻倒伏关的突击运动。到6月21日止，全县七万一千亩大稻已全部排水，培土施肥五万一千四百亩，搁田在二次以上的占95％。目前，稻秆坚硬，生长更加健壮。
    今年黄岩县早稻密植程度高，基肥足，管理工作细，稻苗生长良好，普遍开始抽穗，平均每丛有效分蘖十五根以上。但是突出的问题是部分稻苗有倒伏危险。县委针对这种情况，组织干部、农民、技术员一万二千四百多人，深入田头，进行检查鉴定，着重总结推广了路桥公社良种繁育场防倒伏的经验，并组织大队总支书记以上干部，进行现场参观，有力地批判了“大稻好种防倒难”的畏难情绪。
    为了保证做好防倒工作，全县各地还组织了二千四百九十六个防倒专业队，建立了责任制。目前，这些专业队员正在千方百计做好防倒工作。
