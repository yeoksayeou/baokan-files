Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. Shanghai's industrial and agricultural spare-time education, closely following the new situation of the leap-forward development of the technological revolution movement, is actively serving the current technological revolution movement and has carried out a mass teaching reform.

Since the beginning of this year, with the vigorous development of the nationwide technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants for learning culture and technology has become increasingly high, and they universally demand to learn quickly, learn more, and be able to use what they learn immediately. Under this new situation, the spare-time schools run by many regions, factories, and communes have carried out various flexible and diverse teaching activities to cooperate with the technological revolution according to different objects. In addition to running cultural spare-time schools for systematic learning, many units have also held a large number of special classes for cultivating intermediate and advanced technical talents, as well as short-term or part-work, part-study professional advanced training classes and cultural learning classes. In this way, workers and peasants can study culture in schools, and they can also participate in various technical advanced training classes and special classes to learn professional knowledge. In terms of teaching methods, the old practice of having to learn a large number of basic courses first, and then slowly learning professional courses, has been broken. The method of combining professional knowledge education with basic knowledge education has been adopted. According to the needs of the current technological revolution and scientific research, some professional courses are opened in advance, and teaching is carried out together with basic courses.

Due to the close cooperation with the technological revolution, spare-time schools have become not only places for learning scientific and cultural knowledge, but also bases for coordinating the popularization of production technology experience and scientific research. The No. 1 Vocational Spare-time Middle School in Jing'an District, on the one hand, mobilized more than 6,000 students to use the form of big-character posters to exchange advanced experience in the technological revolution with each other; on the other hand, according to the common needs of the students in the exchange of experience, it opened special courses in chemistry, electricity, radio, etc., and held scientific lectures, technology information stations, etc., to focus on learning the basic theoretical knowledge urgently needed in the technological revolution.

Some factories, especially those manufacturing precision and cutting-edge products, have completely combined the teaching of spare-time schools with technological revolution and scientific research work, making them factories, schools, and scientific research institutes at the same time. The Shanghai Tongren Alloy Factory has already taken some major technological innovation and scientific research projects as the teaching content of technical courses. First, the students put forward preliminary plans according to the production requirements, and then the teachers analyze and explain them to the whole class in the classroom, the engineering and technical personnel supplement the theoretical basis, organize workers to discuss and study collectively, and after obtaining a more perfect plan, the workshop conducts trial production. Through learning, researching, and trial-producing at the same time, from January to April this year, they have researched and trial-produced 66 new products.

While the teaching content and form of Shanghai's industrial and agricultural spare-time education have undergone a series of changes with the development of the technological revolution movement, relatively thorough reforms have also been carried out in terms of teaching materials and teaching methods. Many schools have made major reforms to teaching materials based on the new technologies and new experiences created in the technological revolution movement. At the same time, some modern scientific achievements have been compiled into teaching materials. In addition, the new teaching materials also use a large number of specific examples of production technology as supplementary teaching materials, enriching the teaching content and improving the teaching effect.

Due to the close combination with the development of the technological revolution movement and continuous reform, Shanghai's industrial and agricultural spare-time education has shown an unprecedentedly prosperous situation in running schools. The number of industrial and agricultural spare-time schools in the city has increased from more than 5,200 at the beginning of this year to more than 8,700, and the number of students has increased from more than 1.4 million to more than 1.87 million. It has also played a great role in accelerating the training of technical cadres. In the first quarter of this year, the city's industrial system promoted more than 1,000 engineers from workers, most of whom were in spare-time schools, studying hard, and improving their cultural and technical level.

    适应技术革命形势积极为技术革命服务
    上海工农业余教育进行教学改革
    据新华社上海30日电　上海工农业余教育紧密跟着技术革命运动飞跃发展的新形势，积极为当前技术革命运动服务，进行了群众性的教学大改革。
    今年以来，随着全民性技术革新技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，广大工人、农民学习文化、技术的积极性越来越高涨，普遍要求学得快、学得多，并且学了马上就能用。在这新形势下，许多地区、工厂、公社办的业余学校根据不同对象，开展了各种灵活多样的配合技术革命的教学活动。许多单位除了举办文化业余学校进行系统的学习以外，还大量举办为培养中、高级技术人材的特别班，以及短期的或半工半读的专业进修班和文化学习班。这样，工农群众可以在学校学习文化，也可以参加各种技术进修班、特别班学习专业知识。在教学方法上，大破了过去必须先学大量的基础课程，然后慢慢学习专业课程的惯例，采取了专业知识教育与基础知识教育相结合的方法，根据当前技术革命和科学研究的需要，提前开设一些专业课程，与基础课程一起进行教学。
    由于紧密配合技术革命，业余学校成了既是学习科学文化知识的场所，又是配合推广生产技术经验和科学研究的基地。静安区第一职工业余中学一面发动全校六千多学员采用大字报形式相互交流技术革命的先进经验；一面根据学员们交流经验中的共同需要，开设化学、电学、无线电等学科专修班，举办科学专题讲座、科技问讯站等，突击学习技术革命中迫切需要的基础理论知识。
    有些工厂，特别是制造精密、尖端产品的工厂，更是把业余学校的教学同技术革命和科学研究工作完全结合起来，成了既是工厂，又是学校又是科学研究所。上海铜仁合金厂已经把一些技术革新和科学研究的重大项目作为技术课的教学内容，先由学员根据生产要求提出初步方案，经教师在课堂上向全班学员进行分析讲解，工程技术人员补充理论根据，组织工人集体讨论研究，得到比较完善的方案后，再由车间进行试制。他们通过边学习、边研究、边试制，今年1至4月，已经研究和试制成功了六十六种新产品。
    上海工农业余教育随着技术革命运动发展，教学内容和形式发生一系列变化的同时，对教材、教学方法等方面也相应地进行比较彻底的改革。许多学校根据技术革命运动中所创造的新技术和新经验，对教材作了重大的改革。同时，把一些现代科学成就，编成了教材。此外，新的教材中，还采用大量生产技术的具体实例作为补充教材，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学效果。
    上海工农业余教育由于紧密结合技术革命运动的发展，不断改革，在办学中出现了空前兴旺的局面。全市工农业余学校从今年年初五千二百多所增加到八千七百多所，学员人数从一百四十多万人增加到一百八十七万人。在加速培养技术干部上也起了很大的作用。今年第一季度全市工业系统从工人中提拔了一千多位工程师，其中大多数人是在业余学校刻苦学习，提高了文化技术水平的。
