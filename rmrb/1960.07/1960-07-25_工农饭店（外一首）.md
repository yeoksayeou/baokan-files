Gong Nong (Worker-Peasant) Restaurant (and another poem)
    Sun Zicheng
    Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, was a county in the former Central Soviet Area. The Party and revolutionary base area of Yongxin County were created by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, himself. Today, many revolutionary sites remain in Yongxin County. The "Gong Nong (Worker-Peasant) Restaurant" and the "Red Post Office" are particularly striking among them.

    Gong Nong (Worker-Peasant) Restaurant
    The first worker-peasant restaurant in China, it was born in Yongxin City thirty years ago.
    It prepares grand banquets exclusively for workers, peasants, and soldiers, in accordance with Soviet business regulations.
    No one can find out who the boss is in the restaurant.
    No one is an employee in the restaurant.
    They treat the workers, peasants, and soldiers as masters,
    Workers, peasants, and soldiers get along like brothers.
    The road of revolution is so arduous,
    The burden of revolution weighs heavily on their shoulders,
    People who have been running around for the revolution all day,
    Can register here to stay in the hotel.
    The hotel guests include Soviet cadres,
    The hotel guests include Mao Zedong's fighters,
    Rest well, comrades,
    Prepare to meet the battle tomorrow.

    Red Post Office
    The Soviet postmark shines brightly,
    The mail is sent out like an eagle flying,
    Flying over the blockade to spread the good news of Jinggangshan all over
    The country, and bring the hopes of the people back to Jinggang
    Mountain.
    A piece of mail is a piece of strength,
    It contains the revolutionary declaration and the ideals of workers, peasants, and soldiers,
    Throwing it to the White Area is like a class bomb,
    Throwing it to the Soviet Area is as warm as the spring sunshine.
    The road of revolution is long and arduous,
    Chairman Mao threw out a red line to tie it up.
    Don't look at this as an ordinary store,
    It occupies a glorious chapter in the history of the people's postal service.

    工农饭店（外一首）
    孙自诚
    江西永新县是过去中央苏区的一个县。永新县的党和革命根据地，都是由中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席亲手创造的。今天永新县城内仍留有许多革命的遗址。“工农饭店”和“赤色邮政局”便是其中特别引人注目的。工农饭店中国第一个工农饭店，三十年前在永新城内诞生，它按照苏维埃的营业规章，专为工农兵准备盛筵。饭店里找不出谁是老板，饭店里谁也不是雇员，他们当家作主地将工农兵款待，工农兵相处如兄弟一般。革命的道路是那样艰险，革命的担子沉重地压在双肩，为革命奔走了一天的人们，都可以在这里登记住店。住店的旅客有苏维埃的干部，住店的旅客有毛泽东的战斗员，好好地休息吧，同志们，准备迎接战斗的明天。
      赤色邮政局苏维埃的邮戳闪闪发光，邮件发出像雄鹰飞翔，飞越封锁将井冈山的捷报传遍
  全国，又将全国人民的希望捎回井冈
  山。一份邮件是一份力量，它包藏着革命的宣言和工农兵
  的理想，投向白区是一颗阶级炸弹，投向苏区像阳春一样温暖。革命的道路山高水长，毛主席抛出一根红线将它系上别看这是一幢普通的店铺，它占据了人民邮政史上的光辉
  篇章。
