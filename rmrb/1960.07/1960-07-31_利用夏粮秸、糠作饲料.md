    Utilizing Summer Grain Straw and Bran as Feed

    After the summer harvest, it is essential to promptly and properly store the straw and bran from summer grain crops to prepare sufficient feed for livestock. This is a crucial task in the current development of animal husbandry production.

    According to our understanding, Fan County and Shouguang County in Shandong Province have done a relatively good job in storing feed. We can introduce their practices for everyone to learn from.

    Fan County has already stored over 24 million catties of feed. All wheat straw and bran are piled up and stacked, sealed with mud, and allocated to breeding units based on the number of livestock. The county party committee has put forward four requirements for the stored fodder: no burning, no distribution, no selling, and no mildew. Shouguang County has adopted three-way measures for fodder storage (threshing, weighing, and warehousing simultaneously), three specialties (special leadership, special management, and special storage), and three goods (good stacking, good covering, and good management), requiring that every bit of grass be stacked. The county has already stored over 16 million catties of fodder, which has been allocated to fields and sheds, establishing over 1,600 fodder storage houses. In order to save straw for feed, some canteens have replaced firewood with coal. Commune members reflected, "Last year, we didn't store enough grass, spent more money, and the livestock were still hungry. This year's approach is like living a real life."

    However, some places lack the habit of using by-products of summer grain crops as feed, often using wheat bran, bean stalks, etc., as fuel, which is very regrettable. This habit should be changed.

    利用夏粮秸、糠作饲料
    夏收以后，要及时把夏粮作物的秸秆、糠很好地贮备起来，为牲畜准备足够的饲料。这是当前发展畜牧业生产中一项很重要的工作。
    据我们了解，山东省范县、寿光县对留贮饲料的工作做得比较好，可以介绍一下他们的作法，供大家学习。
    范县已留贮饲料二千四百多万斤，麦秸麦糠全部归堆上垛，用泥封好，并按牲畜头数定量包给饲养单位。县委对留贮的饲草提出不准烧、不准分、不准卖、不准霉等四项规定。寿光县对饲草的留贮采取了三边（边打场、边过秤、边入仓）、三专（专人领导、专人保管、专仓贮存）、三好（垛好、盖好、管好）的措施，要求寸草归垛。该县已留贮的一千六百多万斤饲草都落实到场棚，建立起贮草仓房一千六百多间。为了节省秸秆作饲料，有的食堂已用煤代替烧柴。社员反映：“去年贮草不足，多花了钱，牲口还挨了饿；今年这么办才像个过日子的样。”
    但是，有些地方缺乏利用夏粮作物的副产物作饲料的习惯，往往把麦糠、豆秸等用作燃料，很是可惜，应当改变这种习惯。
