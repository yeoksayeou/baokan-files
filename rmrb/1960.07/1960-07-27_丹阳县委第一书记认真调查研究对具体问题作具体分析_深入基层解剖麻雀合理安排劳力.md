Danyang County Party First Secretary Conducts Serious Investigation and Research, Analyzes Specific Problems
Goes Deep into the Grassroots to Dissect a Sparrow, Makes Rational Arrangements for Labor
Specifically studies the advanced experience of Pengtang Brigade in arranging labor for field management, effectively helps Dagong Brigade and Dabai Commune change the situation of overly dispersed leadership energy and labor utilization, and immediately summarizes the experience for promotion throughout the county.

Editor's Note: This is a report published by the Nanjing Xinhua Daily on July 24. The newspaper added an editor's note when publishing this report. The note said: "Comrade Song Yaxin, First Secretary of the Danyang County Party Committee, goes deep into the grassroots, dissects 'sparrows' around the issue of labor, and then uses it to guide the overall situation, which is a very good leadership method. Rational arrangement of labor is a strategic measure to implement the policy of agriculture as the foundation and strengthen the agricultural front, and it is also a key issue to strengthen field management and win a bumper harvest in the autumn. The situation of overly dispersed leadership energy and labor utilization, as in Dabai Commune, Danyang County, must be changed. In other words, it is necessary to squeeze it carefully. However, squeezing must be done rationally, and we must not be satisfied with drawing a line for labor distribution, or even squeezing randomly. It is best to go deep down to dissect 'sparrows,' analyze specific problems, find feasible solutions, and implement construction while squeezing, just like the Danyang County Party Committee. The so-called construction while squeezing means that while squeezing, we must clarify the guidelines and layout of commune-run industries, commune and team pig farms, and other undertakings, as well as work quotas. For example, how should commune-run industries serve agricultural production; how should commune and team pig farms be run, and how many pigs should one person raise? In a word, squeezing is not to squeeze out forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and commune-run industries altogether, but to make them more lean, healthier, and more prosperous." This newspaper believes that the experience introduced in this report and the arguments in this note are very good and worthy of attention from all localities, so it is reprinted here.

In July, on a hot day, Song Yaxin, First Secretary of the Danyang County Party Committee, carried his backpack and went to Dabai Commune for a short stay. As usual, he should first go to the commune party committee office to talk about the situation, and then see the site, but he first went to the fields to conduct inspections. He walked along the field ridges, sometimes squatting by the fields to check the water management, and sometimes going into the fields to check the specifications of weeding.

When Secretary Song walked into Pengtang Brigade, he saw that the rice grew lush and green, with large plants and thick stalks. The mid-season rice had already covered the furrows, and the late rice was both dark and strong. In particular, many rice and cotton fields had red flags planted at the edges, and everywhere he could see commune members working hard, pumping water, pushing rakes, weeding, and topdressing. However, after leaving this brigade and going to the neighboring Dagong Brigade, he saw that the late rice was turning yellow due to insufficient topdressing, and although the mid-season rice had already closed ranks, it had not been raked even once; the cotton fields were full of weeds. At the same time, there were few people in the fields, and some rice fields were dry and hard, but no one was pumping water, and weeds were spreading. Why was the field management in these two brigades so different, one good and one bad? Secretary Song decided to dissect this sparrow after finishing the field inspection.

Secretary Song talked with the secretaries of the two brigade branches separately, helping them summarize advanced experience and find the reasons for backwardness. After listening to the reports of the two brigade branch secretaries, he found that the main reason for the good or bad field management in the two brigades was the arrangement of labor. Pengtang Brigade had 271 full and half laborers, and more than 75% of them were used for cultivating, raking, weeding, pumping water, and topdressing. Field management was never short of people, and rational division of labor was achieved, with strong laborers doing heavy work and weak laborers doing light work. In particular, they grasped the weeding work early and firmly, which saved a lot of labor. As the saying goes, "Weed the sprouts early, and weed the weeds late (difficult to weed, difficult to rake)." Weeding early, each laborer can weed one and a half acres per day, while weeding late, each laborer can only weed six fen of land per day. This brigade formed a weeding professional team, fixed labor for cultivating, raking, and weeding, and the early, middle, and late rice have been cultivated and raked once or twice, and the cotton fields have also been weeded twice. On the contrary, Dagong Brigade had 250 laborers, but only 130 were used for field management. Where did nearly half of the laborers go? The brigade secretary counted on his fingers, saying how many laborers were needed for silkworm production and how many for living welfare, saying that it was impossible to squeeze out a laborer.

Was the labor force in Dagong Brigade particularly tight? Secretary Song decided to conduct in-depth research among the masses. He first went to work in the fields, and while working, he learned about the situation from the commune members. Seeing that he was barefoot and tanned black, the commune members could not tell that he was the county party secretary. Hearing that a cadre from the county came to work, several poor and lower-middle peasants actively started chatting with him. Secretary Song asked, "It is difficult to see people in your fields. Is there too little labor?" The commune members replied, "To tell the truth, there is not a shortage of labor in the team, but the team cadres are pulling and transferring people everywhere, so the labor for farming cannot be guaranteed." However, Secretary Song was not satisfied with the information he had already learned, so he asked the brigade cadres to lead him to visit the silkworm rearing rooms and canteens. There were only eight silkworm egg cards in the silkworm rearing room, but there were fifty-one commune members managing them, and most of them had nothing to do. There were also many people in the canteen. According to statistics, the labor used in the canteen in the entire brigade accounted for 10% of the total labor. In order to compare and study the problem, Secretary Song immediately rushed to Pengtang Brigade to visit the silkworm rearing rooms and canteens. As a result, he found that the canteen of this team was better than that of Dagong Brigade, but the labor was much less. The silkworm rearing room raised eleven egg cards, but only six young girls were seen feeding mulberry leaves.

It was getting dark, and when Secretary Song went to the production team canteen for dinner, he continued to learn about the labor arrangement from the commune members.

After such repeated and in-depth investigation and research, Secretary Song truly understood the labor issue. That night, he found the branch secretaries of the two brigades, and used the advanced experience of Pengtang Brigade in arranging labor and the conclusions of his own investigation and research to deeply educate the branch secretary of Dagong Brigade. On the one hand, he explained the importance of concentrating leadership energy to first and foremost do a good job in agricultural production, and on the other hand, he specifically helped him re-arrange the labor, squeezed out surplus labor from diversified operations and canteens to strengthen field management, and improved and perfected the production responsibility system.

Secretary Song explored some situations and experiences on the front line of production, had "capital" in hand, and only then did he arrive at the commune party committee with confidence the next day, ready to help the commune cadres dissect a larger sparrow. Dabai Commune was a relatively poor commune. Since the summer harvest and planting, production has been lagging behind. Why has production been lagging behind? Based on his understanding of the situation in the two brigades, Secretary Song instructed the commune party committee to focus on discussing how to ensure the implementation of the policy of agriculture as the foundation in terms of labor arrangement. As soon as the commune party committee discussed this issue and presented the situation, the problem was basically found. Because the commune party committee did not firmly establish the idea of ​​taking agriculture as the foundation, the leadership strength for agriculture was not concentrated, and the labor arrangement on the agricultural front line was not tightly grasped. Of the six secretaries of the commune party committee, only one secretary was in charge of agriculture, in addition to the first secretary in charge of overall work, and the remaining secretaries were assigned to be in charge of other work such as commune-run industry, sideline occupations, finance and trade, culture and education, and life. Moreover, each managed its own labor, and less than 60% of the more than 9,000 laborers in the commune were arranged for agriculture. After discovering these problems, Secretary Song immediately went deep into the relevant commune-run factories and other production professional teams to conduct investigations and research, and convened a meeting of the branch secretaries and factory directors of the commune-run factories to specifically discuss the industrial support agriculture and commune-run industry to serve agriculture policy. He conducted a queue research on each of the fifteen factories, and found that many factories were not directly serving agricultural production or serving the people's lives, but simply pursuing output value. The same was true for commune-run transportation undertakings. Many young and middle-aged laborers flowed into Danyang City to work as porters, and they were praised by the commune cadres because they had cash income every day. In response to this "money-making" mentality, Secretary Song organized the commune party committee to further discuss the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, so that they realized that without grain and industrial raw materials, even with money, it would affect the development of the entire national economy and affect the lives of the broad masses of people. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the commune party committee, in addition to reorganizing the division of labor and ensuring strengthening agricultural leadership, decided to shut down the currently unnecessary velvet factory, paper mounting factory, embroidery factory, etc., and the electronic instrument factory that was being prepared. It immediately transferred back the labor that had blindly flowed into the city to work as porters. In this way, a total of more than 700 laborers were transferred from industry, sideline occupations, and transportation. At the same time, a lot of labor was squeezed out from other aspects, so that the labor used for agriculture in the entire commune increased sharply from less than 60% to more than 80%. Arranging labor is not only a problem for a commune, but a problem that exists in many communes. In order to seize this key to production to guide production throughout the county, Secretary Song also referred to the specific experience of Pengtang and Dagong Brigades, and discussed with the cadres of Dabai Commune, and according to the spirit of the provincial party committee's instructions on solving the labor problem, made a summary of experience. At the same time, Secretary Song and the Dabai Commune Party Committee studied and worked out the "three-seven split" work method, that is, the commune party committee spends 70% of its time grasping agriculture and 30% of its time grasping departmental work, ensuring strengthening the leadership of the agricultural front line from the working hours.

The next day, Secretary Song brought this "sparrow" back to the county party committee from Dabai Commune. After collective research by the standing committee of the county party committee, it was also seriously discussed at the meeting of the first secretaries of the commune party committees. Finally, the specific methods of arranging labor and the "three-seven split" work method of the commune party committee were affirmed. Now, experience in this area has been promoted throughout the county.

    丹阳县委第一书记认真调查研究对具体问题作具体分析
    深入基层解剖麻雀合理安排劳力
    具体研究彭塘大队田间管理劳力安排的先进经验，切实帮助大贡大队、大泊公社改变了领导精力过于分散和劳力使用过于分散的情况，并立即作出经验总结，在全县推广开来。
    编者按：这是7月24日南京新华日报发表的一篇报道。该报在发表这篇报道的时候，加了一个编者按语。按语说：“丹阳县委第一书记宋亚欣同志深入基层，围绕劳动力问题解剖‘麻雀’，然后用来指导全面，是一个很好的领导方法。合理安排劳动力，是当前贯彻农业为基础的方针，加强农业战线的一个战略性措施，也是加强田间管理，夺取秋熟丰收的一个关键问题。像丹阳县大泊公社那样，领导精力过于分散，劳动力使用过于分散的情况，是必须改变的。也就是说，必须认真地挤一挤。但是，挤又必须挤得合理，决不能满足于划一条劳动力分配的杠子，甚至来一个乱挤。最好是像丹阳县委一样，深入下去解剖“麻雀”，对具体问题进行具体分析，找出切实可行的办法，实行边挤边建。所谓边挤边建，就是要在挤的同时，把社办工业、社队猪场以及其他事业的方针布局以至工作定额等明确起来。譬如社办工业，应该如何为农业生产服务；社队养猪场，究竟如何办，一个人应该养多少头猪？总之一句话，挤不是把林牧副渔、社办工业统统挤掉，而是要把它们挤得更加精悍、更加健康、更加兴旺起来。”本报认为这篇报道所介绍的经验和这个按语的论点都是很好的，值得各地重视，特予转载。
    7月，一个炎热的日子，江苏丹阳县委第一书记宋亚欣背了背包走到大泊公社短期落户。照例，应该先到公社党委办公室谈谈情况，再看现场，但他却先到各块田头进行检查。他不停地沿着田岸走，有时蹲在田边检查水浆管理情况，有时又走到田里检查锄草的规格。
    当宋书记走进彭塘大队的时候，只见块块水稻长得乌油油，棵大秆粗，中稻早已不见稻耧，晚稻既乌又壮；棉苗已长到快两尺高，并普遍开花现蕾。特别是许多稻田和棉田的田头都插上红旗，到处都可看到社员们在紧张的劳动，车水的车水，推耥的推耥，锄草的锄草，追肥的追肥。可是，走出这个大队，再到近邻的大贡大队看看时，晚稻因追肥不足，不少稻苗落黄，中稻虽已封行，还没有推过一次耥；棉田草与苗齐。同时，田里看不到几个人，有的稻田干得发硬也没人车水，草荒正在发展。为什么这两个大队的田间管理，一个好，一个差，原因在哪里？宋书记在结束了田头检查之后，决心解剖这个麻雀。
    宋书记分别找两个大队支部书记谈话，帮助他们总结先进经验和找寻落后原因。听了两个大队支部书记的汇报，发现两个大队田间管理的好坏，主要在于劳力安排。彭塘大队二百七十一个整半劳力，用于耘耥、锄草、车水、追肥的就占到75％以上，田间管理不脱人，而且做到合理分工，强劳力干重活，弱劳力干轻活。特别是他们对锄草这项农活抓得早，抓得狠，又节省出不少劳力，俗话说：“早锄草芽，迟锄草爷（难锄、难耥）。”早锄的草，每个劳力每天可锄一亩半，迟锄的草，每个劳力每天只能锄六分田。这个大队就因为成立了锄草专业队，固定劳力耘耥除草，早中晚稻已普遍耘耥一两次，棉田也除草两次。相反，大贡大队二百五十个劳力，用到田间管理上的只有一百三十人，还有近半数的劳力到哪里去了呢？这个大队书记扳扳指头，数数蚕桑生产需要多少劳力，生活福利又需要多少劳力，说是要挖一个劳力也挖不出。
    是不是大贡大队的劳力就特别紧呢？宋书记决定深入群众调查研究。他先是到田间劳动，一面劳动，一面向社员了解情况。社员们见他赤着脚，晒得黑油油的，也分辨不出他是县委书记，听说是县里的干部来劳动的，有几个贫农积极分子就马上跟他扯谈起来。宋书记问：“你们田里很难看到人，劳力太少了吧？”社员们回答说：“说真心话，队里劳力并不少，只是队干部东拉西调，弄得种田劳力没保证。”可是，宋书记还不满足已经了解的这些情况，他又请大队干部领他去参观蚕室和食堂。蚕室里只养八张蚕种，倒有五十一个社员在管理，多数人无事可做；食堂里的人也很多，统计了一下，全大队用在食堂的劳力就占到总劳力的10％。为了对比研究问题，宋书记又紧接着赶到彭塘大队访问蚕室和食堂。结果发现这个队的食堂办得比大贡大队好，而劳力却少得多。蚕室里养了十一张种，却只见六个小姑娘在喂桑叶。
    天黑了，宋书记到生产队食堂吃晚饭时，又继续向社员们了解一些有关劳力安排的情况。
    经过这样反复深入的调查研究，宋书记对劳力问题真正有了底。当晚，他就找了两个大队支部书记，用彭塘大队安排劳力的先进经验和自己调查研究的结论，深刻地教育了大贡大队的支部书记。一面向他讲明集中领导精力首先搞好农业生产的重要性，一面又具体帮助他重新安排了劳力，从多种经营和食堂方面挖出多余劳力加强田间管理，并改进和健全了生产责任制。
    宋书记在生产第一线摸索到一些情况和经验，手里有了“本钱”，第二天才胸有成竹地到达公社党委，准备帮助公社干部解剖更大的麻雀。大泊公社是一个比较差的公社，夏收夏种以来，生产一直掉在后面，为什么生产一直掉在后面？宋书记根据自己在两个大队所摸的底，布置公社党委着重讨论一下：如何从劳力安排上保证贯彻以农业为基础的方针问题。公社党委围绕这个问题一讨论，情况一摆，问题就基本找出来了。由于公社党委没有牢固地树立以农业为基础的思想，对农业的领导力量不集中，对农业第一线的劳力安排也就抓得不紧。公社党委六个书记，除第一书记抓全面工作外，只有一个书记抓农业，其余的书记都分工去抓社办工业、副业、财贸、文教、生活等其他工作。而且各抓各的劳力，全社九千多个劳力，安排到农业上的还不到60％。宋书记在发现这些问题后，又立即深入有关的社办工厂和其他生产专业队进行调查研究，并召开了社办工厂支部书记和厂长会议，专门座谈工业支援农业和社办工业为农业服务的方针，将全部社办工厂一个一个地进行排队研究，发现十五个工厂当中，有许多工厂不是直接为农业生产服务或者为群众生活服务，而是单纯为了追求产值。社办交通运输事业也是这样，有不少青壮年劳力流进丹阳城做搬运工，因为每天有现金收入，还受到公社干部的表扬。宋书记针对这种“赚钱”思想，组织公社党委进一步讨论了以农业为基础的方针，使他们认识到光有钱没有粮、没有工业原料，就会影响整个国民经济的发展，就要影响到广大人民的生活。在提高思想认识的基础上，公社党委几个书记除重新分工，保证加强农业领导外，并决定将目前并不需要的?绒厂、裱纸厂、绣花厂等和正在筹办的电子仪表厂全部停办，将盲目流进城搞搬运工的劳力立即调回来。这样一共从工副业和交通运输方面调出七百多个劳力。同时，又从其他方面挖出不少劳力，使全公社用于农业的劳力从原来不到60％，猛增到80％以上。安排劳力不仅是一个公社的问题，而是许多公社都存在的问题。为了抓住这个生产关键指导全县生产，宋书记又参考彭塘、大贡两个大队的具体经验，和大泊公社干部一起讨论，根据省委关于解决劳力问题指示的精神，作了经验总结。同时，宋书记又与大泊公社党委研究出“三七开”的工作方法，即公社党委以70％时间抓农业，30％时间抓部门工作，从工作时间上保证加强农业第一线的领导。
    第三天，宋书记从大泊公社带了这个“麻雀”回到县委。经过县委常委会的集体研究，又在公社党委第一书记会议上作了认真讨论，最后肯定了安排劳力的具体办法和公社党委的“三七开”工作法。现在，这方面的经验已经在全县推广开来。
