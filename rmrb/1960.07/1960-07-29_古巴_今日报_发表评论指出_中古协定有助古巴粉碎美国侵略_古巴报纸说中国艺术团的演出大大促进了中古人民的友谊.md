Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 28th. The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" today warmly praised the recently signed trade and payment, scientific and technical cooperation, and cultural cooperation agreements between Cuba and China.

The newspaper said, "These agreements are a new victory for the Cuban revolution," "a new and important step in the struggle to smash the U.S. monopoly over our foreign trade," and "a major step forward on the road to economic independence and accelerated development of our economy." The newspaper pointed out that the above-mentioned agreements "are a major assistance to Cuba's industrialization and accelerated economic development."

When discussing the sale of sugar to China, the newspaper said that China's purchase of so much sugar "is a huge aid in smashing the United States' criminal aggression using the reduction of Cuba's sugar quota in the U.S. market." This guarantees that Cuba can firmly sell sugar to a crisis-free, huge, and expanding market for five years.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 28th. The Chinese Art Troupe concluded its fifty-eight-day visit to Cuba. Cuban public opinion hailed the performances of the Chinese Art Troupe as a major event in Cuban art history and believes that the visit and performances of this art troupe, the first sent by the Chinese people to Cuba, have greatly promoted the friendship between the two nations separated by vast oceans.

The Chinese Art Troupe visited six provinces of Cuba and made friends with people from all walks of life in the country. In twenty performances, the Chinese artists introduced traditional Chinese Peking Opera, songs, and dances to Cuban audiences, winning their enthusiastic praise. Cuban newspapers frequently used words like "wonderful," "charming," and "unforgettable" when commenting on the performances of the Chinese artists.

"Revolución" said that the performances of the Chinese artists "will be recorded in the annals of our country's drama history."

"Calle" wrote, "Peking Opera, in an incomparably pure artistic realm, revealed to the Cuban audience for the first time the emotions of the Chinese people and their love for labor and the motherland, emotions expressed with the ingenuity and subtlety characteristic of this ancient nation's artistic conception."

Antonieta Enriquez wrote in "Hoy" when commenting on the art of Peking Opera, "This drama is not only very complete in terms of the diversification of performance forms, but also in the meaning it contains." He said, "The noble, optimistic, and popular art of the new China will be accepted by everyone."

Cuban public opinion believes that the visit of the Chinese artists is a show of support for the cause of the Cuban people. "Hoy" said, "The deepest impression left on the basic audience—workers and peasants—is the content of mutual solidarity and friendship conveyed by the theatrical performances." It said, "The expression of the friendship of the fraternal Chinese people, and their desire to strengthen friendly ties with the Cuban people, are manifested to a very high degree."

The newspaper "Adelante" of Camagüey Province wrote, "The era that limited our motherland to contact with the 'American way of life' and isolated it from everything else has passed." It said that the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe "is unforgettable, and only people who hope to bring the best wishes to those friendly people in order to increasingly strengthen the ties of true friendship and mutual understanding could contribute such a performance."

    古巴“今日报”发表评论指出
    中古协定有助古巴粉碎美国侵略
    古巴报纸说中国艺术团的演出大大促进了中古人民的友谊
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴“今日报”今天热烈赞扬古巴最近同中国签订的有关贸易和支付、科学技术合作和文化合作的协定。
    报纸说，“这些协定是古巴革命的新胜利”，“是在为粉碎美国垄断我国的对外贸易而进行的斗争的一个新的和重要的步骤”，“是在争取经济独立和加速发展我国经济的道路上向前迈进的一大步”。报纸指出，上述协定“是对古巴工业化和加速古巴经济发展的重大援助”。
    这家报纸在谈到向中国出售食糖的问题时说，中国购买这么多的食糖，“对于粉碎美国利用削减古巴在美国市场上的食糖份额而进行的罪恶侵略，是一个巨大援助”。这保证古巴在五年内能向一个没有危机的、巨大的和日益扩大的市场牢牢地出售食糖。
    据新华社哈瓦那28日电　中国艺术团结束了在古巴的为时五十八天的访问。古巴舆论欢呼中国艺术团的演出是古巴艺术史上的大事，并且认为，中国人民首次派往古巴的这个艺术团的访问和演出大大促进了两个远隔重洋的民族之间的友谊。
    中国艺术团访问了古巴的六个省份，同这个国家的各阶层人民交上了朋友。中国的艺术家们在二十场演出中，向古巴观众介绍了中国传统的京剧和歌舞，博得他们的热烈赞赏。古巴报纸在评论中国艺术家的演出时，经常使用“美妙的”、“迷人的”、“令人难忘”这些字眼。
    “革命报”说，中国艺术家们的演出“将载入我国戏剧编年史册”。
    “街道报”写道，“京剧在一个无比纯真的艺术境界中第一次向古巴的观众揭示了中国人民的感情以及他们对劳动和祖国的热爱，这些感情被人们用这个悠久的民族所特有的巧妙和细致的艺术构思表达出来。”
    安托涅塔·恩里克斯在“今日报”上评论京剧艺术时写道，“这种戏剧不仅在表现形式的多样化方面，而且在它所包含的意义上都是十分完整的。”他说，“新中国的高尚的、乐观主义的和人民的艺术将为所有的人接受。”
    古巴舆论认为，中国艺术家的访问是对古巴人民事业的声援。“今日报”说，“给基本观众——工人和农民留下的最深刻的印象是，戏剧演出所具有的互相团结和友谊的内容”。它说，“兄弟的中国人民友谊的表情，以及他们同古巴人民加强友谊联系的愿望，在很高的程度上表现出来。”
    卡马圭省的报纸“前进报”写道，“使我们的祖国仅限于接触‘美国生活方式’。而与其它一切隔绝的时代已经过去了。”它说，中国艺术团的演出“是令人不能忘怀的，只有希望把最好的祝愿带给那些友好的人民以便日益加强真正的友谊联系和相互了解的人们，才可能贡献出这样的演出。”
