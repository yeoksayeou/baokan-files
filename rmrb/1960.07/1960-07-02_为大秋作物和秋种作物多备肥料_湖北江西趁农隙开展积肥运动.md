Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 1st: Hubei Province is seizing the intervals between busy farming seasons to launch a high tide of manure accumulation. Many communes have not only prepared enough top dressing for autumn harvest crops, but some have already begun preparing base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops.

The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions requiring all localities to seize the current favorable opportunity when wild grass is overgrown and aquatic plants are flourishing to concentrate efforts on accumulating fertilizer in order to ensure a large-scale balanced increase in autumn crop production. In accordance with the spirit of the instructions, various localities have launched "three checks and three calculations," namely: check existing fertilizers, check the current growth of seedlings, and check seasonal needs; calculate the fertilizer requirements for autumn harvest crops, calculate the fertilizer requirements for autumn plowing and sowing, and calculate the labor force. When carrying out the three checks and three calculations, Huanggang, Wuhan, and other regions specifically summarized the experience of balanced early rice seedling growth: sufficient base fertilizer, abundant green manure. At the same time, the current situation was repeatedly analyzed among the masses: the area of autumn harvest crops is large, requiring a lot of fertilizer, and the current time is in the gap between busy farming seasons, with abundant green manure all over the mountains and fields, making the timing very favorable. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer. They put forward the slogan "search the mountains, dredge the lakes." Since the beginning of June, more than 80,000 people in the Yidu area have been going to the mountains and lakes every day to accumulate fertilizer. Xiangyang, Jingzhou, Wuhan, and other regions have organized tens of thousands of shock teams, implementing a system of contracted responsibility with designated areas, assigning labor, setting tasks, setting time limits, setting work points, setting quality standards, and setting rewards to make the manure accumulation upsurge both vigorous and solid.

The number of people involved in fertilizer accumulation throughout the province has now reached one million. Many areas are conducting fertilizer accumulation competitions between communes and between production teams. Members of the Yubu Commune in Jianli County, in a fertilizer accumulation competition comparing work efficiency, speed, and quality, separately harvested lake grass, cut dry grass, accumulated domestic manure, collected wild manure, and composted green manure. Within seven days, they not only prepared enough top dressing for more than 70,000 mu of mid-season rice, but also prepared base fertilizer for more than 130,000 mu of late rice.

Xinhua News Agency: Jiangxi Province is carrying out a summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign to prepare fertilizer for late rice and other autumn crops.

Various localities are conscientiously implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," first focusing on accumulating farm manure. 100,000 fertilizer accumulation members in Fuzhou Prefecture are fighting hard in the mountains and fields, cutting green manure, composting manure from humans and animals, and burning lime and fire-soil ash. In the Gan Nan Administrative Region, thirteen counties including Xinfeng, Dayu, Shicheng, and Ningdu have mobilized more than 100,000 people to focus on the "ten-character" measures of cutting (green manure), shoveling (turf), accumulating (manure from humans and animals and ash fertilizer), burning (lime, fire-soil ash), dredging (lake grass), collecting (aquatic fertilizer), utilizing (wild green manure), sweeping (wind-blown dust and garbage), digging (gutter sludge), and returning (returning rice straw to the fields). The fertilizer accumulation and production campaign is developing vigorously. Many communes in Gan County, Guangfeng County, and other counties have launched a competition to "surpass spring fertilizer with summer fertilizer," and have generally achieved rapid progress and good quality in fertilizer accumulation and production. Jiangkou Commune in Gan County, which ranked among the top in the county's fertilizer accumulation competition, has already achieved "three fulls" in fertilizer (pig and cattle pens full, fertilizer cellars full, and manure tanks full).

While vigorously accumulating farm manure, various localities are also seizing the opportunity to manufacture indigenous chemical fertilizers. At present, there are more than 10,000 restored and newly built indigenous chemical fertilizer plants throughout the province. Many areas are using grass ash, wooden bark, clam shell powder, snail shell ash, cattle bone powder, earth nitrate, lime, and various crop stalks and husks as raw materials to produce large quantities of potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, superphosphate, and calcium cyanamide fertilizers using indigenous methods.

Various localities are also seizing the opportunity to raise pigs for manure and establish year-round fertilizer bases. All pig farms throughout the province have established systems for accumulating and managing fertilizer. With pig farms as the center, more than 1,800 year-round fertilizer accumulation and production bases have been established in various parts of Ji'an Prefecture.

    为大秋作物和秋种作物多备肥料
    湖北江西趁农隙开展积肥运动
    新华社武汉1日电　湖北省各地抓紧农事大忙间隙，掀起了积肥高潮。许多公社不仅已为大秋作物备足了追肥，有的已经开始为秋种作物准备底肥。
    中共湖北省委最近发出指示，要求各地抓紧当前野草丛生、水草旺盛的大好时机，集中力量积造肥料，以保证实现秋季作物大面积平衡增产。各地根据指示精神，开展了“三查三算”，即：查现有肥料，查当前禾苗生长情况，查季节需要；算大秋作物需肥量，算秋耕秋种需肥量，算劳力账。黄冈、武汉等地区在开展三查三算时，特地总结了早稻禾苗生长平衡的经验：底肥足，青肥多。同时，在群众中反复分析了当前形势的特点：秋收作物面积大，需要肥料多，而当前又处在大农忙中的空隙，满山遍野青肥又多，时机很有利。因此大大激发了广大群众的积肥积极性。他们提出了“上山找，下湖捞”的口号。宜都地区从6月初以来，每天上山下湖积肥的人数达八万人之多。襄阳、荆州、武汉等地区组织了数以万计的突击队，实行了划片包干，定劳力、定任务、定时间、定工分、定质量、定奖励的积肥责任制，使积肥热潮既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    全省投入积肥的人数现在已达一百万人。许多地区公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间开展了积肥竞赛。监利县余埠公社社员在比工效、比进度、比质量的积肥竞赛中，分头打湖草，砍旱草，积家肥，拣野粪，沤青肥，七天内不仅为七万多亩中稻备足了追肥，也为十三万多亩晚稻准备好了底肥。
    新华社讯　江西各地开展夏季积肥造肥运动，为晚稻和其他秋季作物准备肥料。
    各地认真贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，首先大抓农家肥。抚州专区十万积肥社员，正奋战在山间田野，割青沤肥，积人畜粪肥，烧石灰和火土灰。赣南行政区信丰、大余、石城、宁都等十三个县，出动十万多人，大抓割（青）、铲（草皮）、积（人畜粪和灰肥）、烧（石灰、火土灰）、打（湖草）、捞（水生肥料）、利（利用野生绿肥）、扫（扬尘垃圾）、挖（阴沟污泥）、返（稻草返田）“十字”措施，积肥造肥运动开展得轰轰烈烈。赣县、广丰等县许多公社掀起“夏肥超春肥”竞赛，普遍达到了积肥造肥进度快、质量好。赣县江口公社在全县积肥竞赛中名列前茅，已经实现了肥料“三满”（猪牛栏满、肥窖满、粪缸满）。
    在大积农家肥的同时，各地都抓紧制造土化肥。目前全省恢复生产和新建的土化肥厂已经有一万多个。不少地区利用草木灰、木梓壳、蚌壳粉、螺壳灰、牛骨粉、土硝、石灰和各种农作物的秆壳作原料，用土法加工制造出大量的硫酸钾、硝酸钾、过磷酸钙、石灰氮等肥料。
    各地还抓紧养猪积肥和建立常年性的肥料基地。全省各地养猪场都建立了积肥、管肥制度。吉安专区各地以养猪场为中心，已建立常年性的积肥造肥基地一千八百多个。
