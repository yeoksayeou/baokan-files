(Xinhua News Agency) The wheat harvest has begun in various parts of Liaoning Province. From the Liaodong Peninsula to the northern Liaoning plains, the broad masses of commune members are joyously wielding their sickles and racing against time and fighting the wind and rain to seize the grain, striving to harvest each ripe patch, ensuring that every grain is brought home, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest. The Dalian area, where harvesting began earliest, has completed all wheat harvesting, with over 70% already transported to the threshing grounds and over 50% already threshed, and being put into storage in succession.

This year, spring wheat producing areas in Liaoning Province have universally achieved timely early sowing, rational close planting, and sufficient water and fertilizer, ensuring that wheat was sown early and well. During the wheat seedling growth period, various localities also promptly carried out field management work such as cultivating, weeding, watering, fertilizing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, so wheat generally grew well everywhere.

In light of the increased wheat acreage, early sowing, concentrated maturity period, and recent heavy rainfall this year, all localities made early preparations for the wheat harvest.

(Xinhua News Agency) The western region of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is harvesting spring wheat. From the Hetao Plain along the Yellow River and Ordos to the vast fields south of the Daqing Mountains, golden wheat waves are rolling in the warm sunshine and hot winds, and commune members of all ethnic groups are smiling and reaping with their sickles.

Communes in various locations have especially emphasized improving the quality of the wheat harvest. Many communes have proposed the "Nine Cleans" as a target, requiring that the harvest be cut clean, bundled clean, hauled clean, picked clean, reaped clean, threshed clean, winnowed clean, shaken clean, and swept clean, doing everything possible to prevent grain spillage.

(Xinhua News Agency) Spring wheat in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is generally ripe. The areas on both banks of the Yellow River and in the eastern and southern mountainous regions of the autonomous region have fully entered the busy season of rushing to harvest spring wheat.

This year's spring wheat is being harvested quickly and cleanly. According to incomplete statistics, the daily harvesting progress is over 110,000 mu, and some places have completed all harvesting or have already harvested a large part from the 10th of the month when harvesting began to the 15th. Yinchuan City, in its rush to harvest, rationally arranged labor, grouping male, female, strong, and weak laborers separately, assigning different tasks, and implementing a system of six fixed factors: fixed leadership, fixed time, fixed task, fixed quality, fixed work efficiency, and fixed remuneration. The city completed the harvest of all spring wheat and summer coarse grains in seven days.

(Xinhua News Agency) People of all ethnic groups in Gansu are harvesting spring wheat. According to statistics from five regions, including Zhangye, Dingxi, Linxia, Pingliang, and Tianshui, on the 19th, over 500,000 mu have been harvested.

This year, the spring wheat planting area in Gansu Province has increased by 4% compared to last year. In addition to the three concentrated spring wheat producing areas of Zhangye, Dingxi, and Linxia, Pingliang, Gannan, Lanzhou, and other areas have also expanded the spring wheat planting area. Pingliang Prefecture, which mainly produces winter wheat, has expanded its spring wheat acreage by more than 70,000 mu this year compared to last year.

All spring wheat producing areas made full preparations in terms of manpower and materials before the wheat harvest. Zhangye Prefecture transferred 40%–80% of its labor force from various water conservancy construction sites, commune-run industries, and living welfare facilities to the front line of the summer harvest. Harvesting tools in various locations were also better prepared than in previous years, so it was possible to harvest each ripe patch and transport it immediately.

(Our Correspondent in Xining, 22nd) Spring wheat and highland barley in some irrigated areas along the Yellow River and Huangshui River in Qinghai Province have begun to ripen, and many people's communes have begun the rush to harvest and replant while strengthening field management.

This year's wheat crops have generally grown well, especially the high-yield plots, which account for 30% of the total area, with thick stalks and large ears. According to trial milling in several areas, yields have increased compared to last year. Currently, in the eastern irrigated areas where planting was early, wheat crops have begun to turn yellow. In the northwestern and newly cultivated areas where planting was late, the crops are jointing, heading, or flowering and filling grain. The entire province is at a critical moment of simultaneous harvesting, managing, and planting. All counties have transferred cadres to strengthen leadership on the front line. In Minhe County, where the season is earlier, 90% of the county-level agency cadres have rushed to the front line of harvesting, and production teams in various communes are working in the fields.

(Xinhua News Agency) The battle to rush harvest spring wheat north and south of the Tianshan Mountains has rapidly unfolded. The spring wheat in the counties of Hotan Prefecture and the Turpan Basin in southern Xinjiang, where harvesting began earliest, has all been brought to the threshing grounds and threshed.

The autonomous region's spring wheat area this year is one-third larger than last year. To ensure that the wheat harvest is harvested well, threshed well, and managed well, a large number of cadres have been transferred to the front line of the summer harvest from the beginning of the summer harvest. The Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has also widely promoted the Yining City's system of "Ten Arrivals to the Fields" during the summer harvest, namely: leadership arrives to the fields, repair and manufacture of agricultural tools arrives to the fields, supply of daily necessities arrives to the fields, medical work arrives to the fields, weather forecasts arrive to the fields, etc., which greatly accelerated the harvest progress.

(Xinhua News Agency) The early-sown wheat in Heilongjiang Province, China's main spring wheat producing area, has begun to ripen and a bumper harvest is in sight.

This year, spring wheat in various parts of Heilongjiang Province has grown better than in previous years, with tall stalks, fat leaves, and long ears. Spring wheat in some areas has grown to three or four feet tall, half a foot to more than a foot taller than last year. The ears of wheat are generally about three inches long, half an inch longer than last year.

The broad masses of commune members in rural people's communes and workers in state-owned mechanical farms are smiling and tensely carrying out later-stage field management while preparing for the wheat harvest.

(Xinhua News Agency) The wheat harvest season is approaching in Jilin Province, and spring wheat throughout the province is generally growing with thick stalks, large ears, and many plump grains. People's communes in various areas are continuing to strengthen later-stage wheat field management, weeding, topdressing, and fiercely attacking the wheat filling stage.

Various localities are seizing the time to repair and manufacture harvesting, transporting, and threshing tools. According to preliminary statistics from seven counties, including Nong'an, Fuyu, Da'an, and Dunhua, more than 5,000 units of horse-drawn harvesters and wheat threshers have been prepared.
