Qi Baishi's Paintings Come to Life
Ye Qianyu

After watching the animated films "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" and "The Story in the Mural," the audience all wore smiles. Besides admiration, they discussed the films animatedly. They said that in the past, animated films were always about foxes, crows, bears, or kittens. Adults found them boring, and children didn't find them new. You could say they had some educational value, but they just weren't exciting. Now, the Great Leap Forward has been brought into animated films. It's truly bold, daring, full of spirit, and exciting, a real delight.

Some viewers said: the subject matter is fresh, and the educational effect is significant. We put that soaring energy into the Great Leap Forward. Poets and painters have written so many poems and painted so many pictures for us, and we ourselves have written and painted. Now, these poems and paintings have been brought into animated films. We feel even more excited when we see them and feel more energized. When children see them, they truly understand what the Great Leap Forward is all about, and new things are added to their young minds.

Such animated films are a product of the Great Leap Forward itself. They are bound to break through old conventions and create new styles. Therefore, they are bound to be welcomed by the people of the Great Leap Forward.

At the same time as "The Story in the Mural," the Shanghai Animation Film Studio also created the paper-cut film "The Little Fish Boy," applying the art of paper-cutting to animated films and creating another new style. It is said that this production method saves time and labor compared to general animated films and has significant innovative significance in technology. Paper-cutting is a unique form in Chinese art. Its characteristics are simplicity, crispness, clarity, and transparency. Shadow puppetry utilizes these characteristics to exert its power. Paper-cut films can be said to be a new development of shadow puppetry, greatly expanding the range of image activity. This success marks the opening of its own path for Chinese animated films in terms of form and style.

While we are still admiring the above achievements, the artists of the art film have put forward ambitious aspirations, saying that they want to bring Chinese ink paintings to life, bring political cartoons to life, and bring to life all national art that can be animated. It's only been two or three months since they said this, and the little animals in Qi Baishi's paintings have already jumped onto the screen to perform for us. How fast!

Turning ink paintings into animation is not easy; it is much more complicated than paper-cutting. In order to bring out the charm of ink painting, we know that Rongbaozhai's woodblock printing color separation process is quite ingenious. Sometimes a stroke of ink color requires several color plates. Where the ink colors are blended, there are no traces. This is a very delicate and complex technological skill. Woodblock printing is like this, and ink painting animation is probably not simpler than it. It is conceivable that in the production process, artists must overcome many difficulties to successfully trial-produce. This is the first hurdle in animating ink paintings. Even if this hurdle is overcome, the whole problem has not been solved.

The key issue is: to require the images under Qi Baishi's brush to act according to the artistic conception prescribed by Qi Baishi, not according to the wishes of the animation artist. Therefore, in artistic expression, it is necessary to deeply understand Qi Baishi's creative ideas and artistic characteristics, and then, on this basis, re-recognize the spiritual appearance of the frogs, shrimps, chicks, grasshoppers, and other small lives to be depicted. In this way, can we grasp the artistic conception created by Qi Baishi, so as to carry out re-creation. This is like a performing artist playing a composer's piece. First, it is necessary to be loyal to the artistic conception of the original work, and then apply a layer of their own color. Since it is a re-creation, of course, the imagination and creation of animation artists cannot be excluded. Regarding such a creative process, the artists participating in the trial production of this new film type have completed the task faithfully and imaginatively. Therefore, people who have watched this short film say: if Old Man Baishi were alive, he would definitely nod and praise it.

This short film is divided into three segments. The first segment is the story of a frog, and dragonflies and crabs also appear in the same scene. The story depicts a frog playing in the water, when one of its legs gets tangled in the weeds. It cannot break free, and when a dragonfly sees this scene, it calls the crab over. The crab uses its large claws to bite off the weeds, and the frog regains its freedom. The second segment depicts shrimp and small fish, leisurely swimming in the water together. Suddenly, a petal flies over and floats on the surface of the water. These small animals immediately become active and chase the petal together, tumbling up and down, chasing each other, making a scene. The third segment depicts two chicks fighting for an earthworm. After fighting for a long time, they are not careful, and the earthworm burrows back into the soil. Later, they chased a grasshopper together under a melon trellis. The grasshopper jumped very far and fast. They tried very hard but still couldn't catch it. Finally, they came up with a plan and captured it.

In Qi Baishi's paintings, these images are static and scattered. After re-creation, they are given new life. So, they are alive, they are connected to each other, forming a delightful and wonderful world. This world is different from the previous world of foxes and crows or bears and kittens. This is a fairy tale and poem excavated by Qi Baishi in the vast world of natural beauty, and a new flower cultivated by the romantic tradition of Chinese painting art. This excellent new variety, although only appeared on the screen for three or five minutes, has already shown great artistic power. The history of Chinese art films is only twelve years, and compared with the achievements of today and the era of initial creation, the speed of progress is amazing, especially in the past two years, it has been advancing by leaps and bounds. The general line of the Great Leap Forward has blossomed in Chinese art films, and we should cheer in unison for this fruitful cultural revolution achievement!

### 齐白石的画动起来了

    齐白石的画动起来了
    叶浅予
    看了动画片《大跃进万岁》和《壁画里的故事》，观众个个面带喜容，除了赞叹之外，不约而同地议论起来。他们说，从前哪，动画片里不是狐狸、乌鸦，便是小熊小猫，大人看了没意思，小孩看了也不新鲜。你说没有教育作用，似乎也有一点，可就是不带劲。现在，大跃进搬进了动画片，真是敢想敢干，有气派，有劲头，真过瘾。
    有的观众说：题材新鲜，教育作用也大。咱们在大跃进里那股子冲天干劲，诗人画家为我们写了多少诗，画了多少画，我们自己也写过画过，而现在又把这些诗和画搬进了动画片，咱们看了更加过瘾，觉着浑身添了劲；孩子们看了，才真懂得大跃进是怎么回事，小心眼儿里添了些新东西。
    这样的动画片，是大跃进本身的产物，它必然要冲破旧套子，创造新风格，所以也必然为大跃进的人们所欢迎。
    与《壁画里的故事》同时，上海美术片厂还创作了剪纸片《渔童》，把剪纸艺术运用到动画片里去，创造了另一种新风格。据说，这种制作方法，比一般动画片省时省工，在技术上具有重大的革新意义。剪纸是中国美术里的一种独特形式，它的特点是简洁利落，鲜明剔透，皮影戏就是运用这个特点发挥威力的。剪纸片可以说是皮影戏的新发展，使皮影戏形象的活动幅度大大扩展了。这个成功，标志着中国动画片在形式风格方面开辟了自己的道路。
    当我们还在赞赏以上的成就时，美术片的艺术家们又提出了雄心壮志，说是要把中国的水墨画动起来，把政治讽刺画动起来，把民族美术可以动的都动起来。这话说了才两三个月，齐白石画中的小动物已经跳上银幕，为我们演戏了。真快！
    把水墨画变成动画，可不简单，这比剪纸要复杂得多。为了发挥水墨画的笔情墨趣，我们知道，荣宝斋的木版水印画的套色工艺是相当巧妙的，有时一笔墨彩需要几块套板，墨色浓淡交融之处，不着痕迹，这是十分细致而复杂的工艺技术。木板水印如此，水墨动画片不见得比它简单些。可以想像，在制作过程中，艺术家们必须克服重重困难，才能试制成功。这是水墨画动画化的第一道难关。这道难关攻破了，全部问题还没有解决。
    关键问题是：要求把齐白石笔下的形象，按照齐白石所规定的艺术意境行动起来，不是按照动画艺术家的意愿行动起来。因此，在艺术表现上，必需深刻体会齐白石的创作思想和艺术特点，然后，在这个基础上，对所要描写的青蛙、虾、小鸡、蚱蜢等等小生命的精神状貌，重新加以认识。这样，才能把握齐白石所创造的艺术意境，从而进行再创造。这好比演奏艺术家演奏作曲家的曲子，首先必需忠实于原作的艺术意境，然后敷上一层自己的色彩。既然是再创造，当然不能排除动画艺术家的想像和创造。关于这样一个创作过程，参加试制这个新片种的艺术家们既忠实又富于想像地完成了任务。所以，看了这个短片的人都说：要是白石老人在世的话，他一定会点头称赞。
    这个短片共分三段。第一段是一只青蛙的故事，同场还出现蜻蜓和螃蟹。故事描写一只青蛙在水中游戏，被水草缠住了一条腿，怎么也挣不脱，一只蜻蜓见到了这情景，把螃蟹叫了来，螃蟹用大螯噬断了水草，青蛙才恢复了自由。第二段是描写虾和小鱼，悠闲地结队在水中游戏，忽然飞来了一片花瓣，飘在水面上，这些小动物立刻活跃起来，一齐去追逐这片花瓣，上下翻腾，你追我赶，闹了一场。第三段描写两只小鸡，争夺一条蚯蚓，争来争去，一不留神，蚯蚓又钻进了泥土。后来他们在瓜棚下共同追逐一只蚱蜢，蚱蜢跳得很远很快，他们费了很大的劲还是捉不到，最终他们想出了计谋，擒住了它。
    在齐白石的画里，这些形象是静止的，分散的，经过再创造，赋予了新生命。于是，它们活了，彼此联系起来了，形成了一个逗人欢乐的奇妙的世界。这个世界不同于以前那些狐狸与乌鸦或小熊与小猫的世界，这是齐白石在自然美的广阔天地中发掘出来的童话和诗篇，是中国绘画艺术的浪漫主义传统孕育出来的新花朵。这个出色的新品种，虽然只在银幕上出现了三五分钟，可是已显出了极大的艺术力量。中国的美术片历史不过短短十二年，以现在的成就和初创时代相比，进步的速度是惊人的，特别是这两年来，更是一日千里，飞跃前进。总路线大跃进在中国美术片上开了花，我们应该为这个丰硕的文化革命果实齐声欢呼！
