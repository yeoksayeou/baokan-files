Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd, Washington dispatch: The U.S. Congress has passed huge appropriations to expand military bases both at home and abroad.

    The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on July 1st allocating $994,855,000 to expand military bases around the world.

    On the same day, the Senate passed a series of separate appropriation bills for the expansion of military bases and sent them to U.S. President Eisenhower for approval. These bills provide for the expansion of U.S. sea, land, and air force aggression bases in Asia and the Pacific region. The appropriation passed by the Senate for expanding U.S. military bases in Okinawa amounted to $19,751,000, of which $10 million was used to build "Mace" missile launch sites. The appropriation to strengthen U.S. military bases in South Korea amounted to more than $10 million. The appropriation for expanding the Guam base was more than $10 million. The appropriation for expanding U.S. naval and air force bases in the Philippines was more than $5 million.

    The U.S. Senate Armed Services Subcommittee recently requested the U.S. Department of Defense to accelerate the establishment of a supersonic bomber fleet carrying nuclear weapons. In a report, it emphasized that establishing a so-called "modern deterrent force" has become "more important." The report advocated replacing the B-47 jet bombers, currently the mainstay of the so-called "strategic strike force," with newer B-58 bombers as quickly as possible.

    At the same time, the U.S. is also vigorously developing missiles. The U.S. government has transferred the Eniwetok nuclear test site in the Pacific, originally managed by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, to the U.S. Department of Defense as a missile impact area for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. The U.S. military is preparing to conduct a series of missile tests.

U.S. Aggressor Troops in Korea, Colluding with Puppet Troops, Create an Atmosphere of War
Hold Large-Scale "War Game" Exercises
Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd, Seoul dispatch: According to an announcement by the U.S. aggressor troops headquarters in Korea on July 1st, the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea and the South Korean puppet troops began a fifteen-day land, sea, and air force "war game" exercise on that day. Participating in the exercise were the headquarters of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea, the headquarters of the U.S. Eighth Army, and the land, sea, and air forces of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea and the South Korean puppet troops.

    The large-scale provocative military exercise held by the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea is only ten days after the number one U.S. war-monger, Eisenhower, conducted a bandit-like "visit" to South Korea on June 19th and 20th.

    According to reports, in order to intensify the tense situation, the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea, with ulterior motives, called this exercise "retaliation." The headquarters of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea declared that before July 10, this U.S. military's war preparation activity "will be limited to garrison areas"; after the activity is transferred to "the battlefield" for execution, "a period of war games will be held." It also announced that after the exercise enters the "combat" stage, South Korean puppet troops' aircraft "will conduct imaginary tactical flights."

    As previously reported, in order to intensify the tension in the Far East, strengthen the U.S. military deployment in South Korea, and attempt to provoke a new war, and also attempt to further use force to intimidate and suppress the South Korean people, U.S. imperialism conducted a series of provocative military exercises in June in areas near the Korean Military Armistice Line and in the Pohang area of South Korea.

Gates Yelled in the U.S. Senate
The United States Wants to Deploy Military Forces Around the World
Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Washington: A group of senior U.S. government officials, headed by Secretary of State Herter, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 28th, clamoring that the United States should maintain and strengthen the so-called "common security" program aimed at carrying out foreign aggression and expansion and intensifying the "Cold War."

    Herter said in his testimony that the developments in recent months have illustrated "the stark realities facing the United States." This reality "requires us to continue and strengthen this program." Herter emphasized the so-called "deterrent defense force" provided by this program, saying that "at the present moment" "particularly important" is that Congress must pass the foreign "aid" program in the amount requested by Eisenhower.

    Defense Secretary Gates expressed fear in his testimony about the prospect of the military bloc cobbled together by the United States teetering on the brink of collapse. He emphasized that U.S. foreign military assistance is "as indispensable to the overall defense of the United States as our own armed forces." He stressed that the $2 billion in foreign military "aid" allocated by the United States for the next fiscal year is "extremely important." Gates also stated that the United States not only will never retreat to within its own borders but must deploy its military forces around the world.

British Newspapers Reveal
The United States Plans to Push Missile Submarines Close to the Soviet Union
Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th: British newspapers revealed today that the United States is planning to deploy submarines equipped with "Polaris" missiles (capable of carrying hydrogen warheads) to places closest to the Soviet Union through the North Atlantic Group.

    "News Chronicle" reporter MacPherson wrote today that U.S. Naval Commander for Western Europe Smith personally told him that the first U.S. submarine carrying "Polaris" missiles, scheduled to be commissioned at the end of this year, will be incorporated into the U.S. Second Fleet in the Atlantic.

    MacPherson continued: "Currently, the 'Polaris' missile has a range of only 900 miles. To make it effective, it must be deployed as close to Russia as possible."

    美国扩军备战活动日益猖狂
    美国国会通过庞大拨款
    大肆扩建美国国外军事基地
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国会通过庞大拨款来扩建国内外军事基地。
    美国众议院1日通过了一项法案，拨款九亿九千四百八十五万五千美元用以在世界各地扩充军事基地。
    同一天，参议院通过了一系列扩建军事基地的分项拨款法案，并送交美国总统艾森豪威尔批准。这些法案规定扩充美国在亚洲和太平洋区的海、陆、空军侵略基地。参议院通过用来扩建冲绳美军基地的拨款达一千九百七十五万一千美元，其中有一千万美元用来建筑“马斯”导弹发射场。用来加强美国在南朝鲜军事基地的拨款达一千多万美元。扩建关岛基地拨款为一千多万美元。扩建美国在菲律宾海、空军基地的拨款是五百多万美元。
    美国参议院军备小组委员会最近要求美国国防部加速建立携带核武器的超音速轰炸机队。它在一项报告中强调说，建立一支所谓“现代威慑力量”已变得“更加重要”。报告鼓吹赶紧以更新式的B—58式轰炸机来代替目前作为所谓“战略打击力量”主力的B—47式喷气轰炸机。
    同时，美国也在大力发展导弹。美国政府已经把原属美国原子能委员会管理的在太平洋中的恩尼威托克核试验场移交给美国国防部作为试射洲际弹道导弹的导弹命中区。美国军方准备进行一连串的导弹试验。
    侵朝美军伙同伪军制造战争气氛
    举行大规模“假想战争”演习
    新华社2日讯　汉城消息：据侵朝美军司令部1日宣布，侵朝美军同南朝鲜伪军从这一天开始举行历时十五天的陆海空军“假想战争”演习。参加演习的有侵朝美军总部、美国第八军总部以及侵朝美军和南朝鲜伪军的陆海空军部队。
    侵朝美军举行这次大规模的挑衅性军事演习，距美国头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔6月19、20两天在南朝鲜进行强盗“访问”仅仅相隔十天。
    据报道，侵朝美军为了加剧紧张局势，别有用心地把这次演习叫做“还击”。侵朝美军司令部宣称：在7月10日以前，美军这次备战活动“将限于驻军地区”；在活动转到“战场上”进行后，“将举行一段时间的假想战争”。它还宣布，在演习进入“作战”阶段以后，南朝鲜伪军的飞机“将作假想的战术飞行”。
    前已报道，美帝国主义为加剧远东紧张局势，加强美国在南朝鲜的军事部署，妄图挑起新战争，并且企图进一步用武力恫吓和镇压南朝鲜人民，6月间就曾经在靠近朝鲜军事停战线的地区和南朝鲜浦项地区进行了一系列的挑衅性军事演习。
    盖茨在美国参议院叫嚷
    美国要在全世界部署军事力量
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：以国务卿赫脱为首的一批美国政府高级官员于6月28日接连到参议院拨款委员会作证，叫嚷美国要保持和加强目的在于对外进行侵略扩张和加剧“冷战”的所谓“共同安全”计划。
    赫脱在作证时说，最近几个月的事态发展说明了“美国所面临的严酷现实”。这个现实“需要我们继续执行和加强这个计划”。赫脱强调这个计划提供的所谓“威慑性防务力量”，他说，在“目前时刻”“特别重要的”是，国会必须按照艾森豪威尔所要求的数目通过对外“援助”计划。
    国防部长盖茨在证词中对美国所拼凑的军事集团濒临土崩瓦解的前景感到恐惧。他强调说，美国的对外军事援助就像“我们自己的武装部队一样对美国的总的防务是必不可少的”。他强调，美国为下一财政年度拨出的二十亿美元的对外军事“援助”是“极端重要的”。盖茨并且表示，美国不仅决不退回到它自己的边界之内，而且必须在全世界部署它的军事力量。
    英国报纸透露
    美国打算把导弹潜艇逼近苏联
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国报纸今天透露，美国正在打算通过北大西洋集团，把装备有“北极星”式导弹（可携带氢弹头）的潜艇配置到离苏联最近的地方。
    “新闻纪事报”记者麦克弗森今天写道，美国驻西欧海军司令史密斯亲自对他说，定于今年年底服役的第一艘携带“北极星”式导弹的美国潜艇，将编入在大西洋的美国第二舰队。
    麦克弗森接着写道：“目前，‘北极星’式导弹只有九百英里射程。要使它有效，就必须把它尽量部署在距俄国最近的地方。”
