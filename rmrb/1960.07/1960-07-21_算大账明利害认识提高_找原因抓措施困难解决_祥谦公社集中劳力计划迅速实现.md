According to the Fujian Daily, the Minhou County Committee of Fujian Province, in a thorough inspection of Xiangqian Commune's implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, discovered that the commune was not concentrating its labor force quickly enough, and the summer harvest and planting were progressing slowly. After the county committee helped the commune party committee analyze the reasons and take measures, this situation has been rapidly reversed.

Due to the all-round development of various industries in Xiangqian Commune and the excessive number of capital construction projects, the area for summer harvesting and planting this year has expanded by 6,000 mu compared to last year, resulting in a very tight labor force. After the spirit of the provincial party committee's expanded meeting was implemented, the commune party committee immediately made a plan to concentrate the labor force, deciding to suspend construction of the Sanxikou Reservoir, a key water conservancy project that would not benefit this year, and all 2,000 migrant workers would return to agriculture; among the commune-run factories and farms, except for the farm implement factory and vehicle factory, more than 40% of the labor force from pottery, brick and tile, textile, and chemical factories not directly related to agriculture would be transferred to agriculture; and the labor force ratio of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery would be streamlined and adjusted. In this way, the entire commune could increase the labor force投入 into summer harvesting and planting by more than 4,000 people, and the agricultural labor force could reach 80% of the total rural labor force, ensuring that the summer harvesting and planting work would be completed in a timely manner before the end of July. However, this plan was not conscientiously implemented, with the result that less than 1,000 people were added to the summer harvesting and planting labor force after the busy summer harvest season began.

Ma Fuxiang, secretary of the Minhou County Committee, inspected work in Xiangqian Commune. In his conversations with commune members, he found that they were very dissatisfied with the slow progress of the harvest and the resulting loss of grain. In order to further clarify the situation and solve the problem, Comrade Ma Fuxiang immediately convened a forum of cadres and commune member representatives in the Dongsheng Brigade together with the commune party committee secretary to study the reasons for the slow progress of the summer harvest. Through discussions and analysis with the commune party committee, it was found that there were three main problems. First, although the vast majority of cadres verbally supported the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key, they lacked a deep understanding, and were unable to make up their minds when it came to the specific implementation of the labor force transfer plan. The commune party committee believed that it would not be easy to restart commune-run industrial capital construction projects after they were shut down, so only a little more than 100 people were transferred from among the 300 laborers. The output value of commune-run chemical plants, textile mills, and other enterprises was relatively high, and the factory leaders were unwilling to transfer labor, believing that transferring people to agriculture was not worth the loss. Secondly, some specific problems were not solved in time, which also affected the concentration of the labor force. For example, although the commune party committee decided to temporarily shut down the Sanxikou Reservoir, it was worried that the height of the dam was not enough to block floods, so more than 2,000 migrant workers were slow to withdraw. When the party branches of each brigade implemented the regulations on suspending some sideline production, they also considered that reducing industry and sideline occupations would reduce income and fear that it would affect the living expenses of commune members during the summer harvest and the summer harvest distribution. But seeing that the ripening rice did not have enough labor to harvest, they were also anxious. Chen Yongsheng, the party branch secretary, felt "caught in the middle and unable to manage." Third, the leadership style of the commune party committee was not deep enough, satisfied with the figures reported by the lower levels for the transfer of labor, without in-depth inspection, and at the same time, it did not study and solve the problems that occurred in the transfer of labor, so the plan to concentrate the labor force could not be implemented.

After inspecting and discovering these problems, the commune party committee, with the specific help of the county committee, immediately took strong measures to correct this phenomenon. First, it conducted in-depth education on the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key, using methods such as accounting and comparison to fully explain the great significance of concentrating more than 80% of the labor force into抢收抢种 at present. Dongsheng Brigade calculated such an account: if early rice that is 10% ripe is not harvested, it will lose at least 10%, and if it rains, the loss will be even greater. The team's more than 800 mu of early rice has a yield of more than 600 jin per mu. If there is a general loss of 10%, that is 60 jin per mu, totaling 50,000 jin, worth 3,500 yuan. This is about the same as the income of the entire team from less than ten days of industry and sideline occupations, and grain is the most precious treasure, and wasting grain is the biggest loss.

On the basis of raising awareness, further solved the specific problems in the concentration of labor. For example, after on-the-spot inspection and research, the dam of the Sanxikou Reservoir was already 51 meters high, and there would be no problems even if it rained continuously for 500 millimeters. Therefore, except for dozens of stonemasons, more than 2,000 migrant workers were immediately withdrawn. After some industries and sideline occupations of the commune and team were suspended, in order to solve the current daily expenses of commune members, the commune first allocated 70,000 yuan to each brigade as an advance payment. At the same time, it helped each professional team, orchard, and livestock farm to rationally arrange the labor force, so that they could spare some labor to support the harvesting and planting without affecting the original production. After taking the above measures, more than 2,600 laborers were withdrawn from the construction site of the whole commune, more than 2,200 laborers were withdrawn from the factories and farms run by the commune and the team, and more than 1,300 laborers were adjusted from multiple economies and animal husbandry. Therefore, by July 11, the labor force投入 into harvesting and planting had soared to 13,500, accounting for 83% of the total labor force, which rapidly increased the progress of summer harvesting to 3,800 mu per day.

    算大账明利害认识提高  找原因抓措施困难解决
    祥谦公社集中劳力计划迅速实现
    据福建日报消息 福建闽侯县委深入检查祥谦公社贯彻以农业为基础的方针时，发现这个公社劳力集中不快，夏收夏种进展迟缓。经过县委帮助公社党委分析原因，采取措施，已迅速扭转。
    祥谦公社由于各行各业全面发展，基建摊子过大，今年夏收夏种面积却比去年扩大了六千亩，因此劳力十分紧张。省委扩大会议的精神贯彻后，公社党委立即作出了集中劳力的计划方案，决定今年不能受益的重点水利工程三溪口水库暂停施工，二千个民工全部归队搞农业；社办厂场中，除农具厂、车辆厂外，与农业无直接关系的陶器、砖瓦、纺织化工等厂都抽出40％以上的劳力转入农业；并精简后勤和调整林、牧、副、渔业的劳力比例。这样全社投入夏收夏种的劳力可以增加四千多人，农业劳力可达农村总劳力的80％，保证夏收夏种工作在7月底前适时完成。但是，这个计划方案并没有得到认真贯彻，以致进入夏收大忙后，投入夏收夏种的劳力增加不到一千人。
    闽侯县委书记马福祥到祥谦公社检查工作，他在和社员交谈中，发现社员对收割进度缓慢、造成脱粒损失很不满意。为了进一步弄清情况，解决问题，马福祥同志立即和公社党委书记一起在东升大队召集干部和社员代表座谈，研究夏收进度不快的原因。通过座谈和与公社党委分析研究，发现主要存在三个问题。首先广大干部对以农业为基础、以粮为纲的方针虽然口头上拥护，但缺乏深刻理解，在具体执行抽调劳力计划时，就下不了决心。公社党委认为社办工业基建工程下马后再上马不容易，因此在三百个劳力中只抽出一百多人。社办化工厂、纺织厂等企业单位的产值较高，厂领导不肯抽出劳力，认为抽人去搞农业是得不偿失。其次，有些具体问题没有及时得到解决，也影响到劳力的集中。如公社党委虽然决定三溪口水库暂时下马，但又顾虑大坝的高度不够，挡不住洪水，因此二千多民工迟迟不退场。 各大队党支部在执行暂停某些副业生产规定时，又考虑到少搞工业和副业会减少收入，怕影响夏收期间社员生活开支和夏收分配。但看到黄熟的稻子没有足够的劳力去抢收，心中也着急，党支部书记陈永盛感到“两头为难、难以当家”。第三，公社党委领导作风不够深入，满足于下面汇报的抽调劳力数字，没有深入检查，同时对抽调劳力中发生的问题，也没有研究解决，因此集中劳力的计划不能贯彻实现。
    经过检查，发现这些问题后，公社党委在县委的具体帮助下，立即采取有力措施，纠正这种现象。首先深入进行以农业为基础、以粮为纲的方针的教育，运用算账对比等方法，充分说明当前集中80％以上劳力投入抢收抢种的重大意义。东升大队算了这样一个账：早稻十成熟还不收，至少要损失一成，如果下一场雨，损失将更大。全队八百多亩早稻，亩产都在六百斤以上，如普遍损失一成，每亩六十斤，合计就是五万斤，值三千五百元。与全队少搞十天工业和副业的收入差不多，而粮食又是宝中之宝，抛撒粮食是最大的得不偿失。
    在提高认识的基础上，又进一步解决了集中劳力中的具体问题。如三溪口水库的大坝，经实地检查研究，已经有五十一米高，在连续下雨五百毫米的情况下，不会出问题，因此除留几十个石工外，把二千多民工立即撤下来。社队一部分工业和副业暂停后，为了解决当前社员日用开支的需要，先由社里拨出七万元借给各大队作为预支款。同时帮助各专业队、果林畜牧场合理安排劳力，使他们在不影响原来生产的情况下，抽出一部分劳力支援收种。采取以上办法后，全社基建工地抽出劳力二千六百多人，社队办的厂场抽出二千二百多人，多种经济和畜牧业调整出一千三百多人。因此到7月11日，投入收种的劳力就猛增到一万三千五百人，占总劳力的83％，使夏收进度迅速提高到日割三千八百亩。
