　　Nanchang, July 10th (This newspaper) - The broad masses of cadres at the Ji'an Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province are vigorously improving their working methods, consulting with the masses on everything, making their work more detailed, boosting the enthusiasm of the masses, and continuously increasing steel production. Compared to May, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in June increased from below one to above two; daily pig iron production increased from 50 tons to over 100 tons; the pig iron qualification rate increased from below 80% to above 90%; and the coke ratio decreased from 1.5 to below one.

　　In the Past, They Worked Day and Night Alongside the Masses
　　But Were Outwardly Agreeable but Inwardly Estranged from the Masses
    Most of the cadres at the Ji'an Steel Plant grew up during the mass movement to produce steel in 1958. They have always maintained the good habit of eating, living, and working with the masses. However, with the rapid development of steel production, new situations have emerged where the cadres' working methods are not adapted to the situation. Some cadres, although working day and night at the furnaces, lacked consultation with the masses and often directed production based on their personal experience and views. As a result, new problems in production could not be understood in a timely manner, and problems could not be quickly resolved when discovered. After discovering this situation, the plant's Party committee, under the leadership of the Ji'an Prefectural and Municipal Party committees, continued to lead cadres to delve into the front lines of production, eating, living, and working with the masses. On the other hand, they adopted a series of measures to vigorously improve the cadres' working methods, ensuring that they consulted with the masses on everything, at all times.

　　Putting Politics in Command and Educating Cadres
　　Truly Believing in the Power of the Masses
　　Adhering to putting politics in command and educating the broad masses of cadres to believe in the power of the masses ideologically and to recognize the importance of consulting with the masses on everything is an important reason for the significant improvement in the working methods of the cadres at the Ji'an Steel Plant. The plant's Party committee, in response to the erroneous ideas of pride, complacency, and self-righteousness among some cadres, organized cadres to re-study various documents and instructions of the Party's mass line and launched a major debate. Through the debate, cadres theoretically recognized the enormous power of the masses and understood that consulting with the masses on everything is a magic weapon for doing a good job. On the other hand, they used many typical examples, both good and bad, to educate and enlighten the broad masses of cadres, making them more deeply realize the practical significance of consulting with the masses more. Thus, the "four togethers" were fully implemented among the cadres: eating together, living together, working together, and consulting together. All cadres in the plant, from the secretary and director to the heads of departments and work sections, to the general cadres, were assigned areas of responsibility and settled down at the furnaces and construction sites. They were humble and down-to-earth in their work, consulted with the masses on everything, making their work more detailed. For example, Chen Yong, the head of a work section, was active, responsible, and resolute in his work; but he used to be somewhat self-righteous. When he was leading the production of blast furnace No. 14, molten iron often rushed out of the taphole prematurely. He couldn't think of a good solution himself, and he didn't consult with the workers, so the problem could never be solved. This time, his style has changed greatly. When he encountered the same problem in leading the production of blast furnace No. 15, he took the initiative to consult with the furnace workers. The furnace workers said that our taphole is still designed according to general wind temperature and air volume. Now, with high winds and high temperatures, the hot molten iron cannot be contained. Comrade Chen Yong was greatly inspired and immediately worked with the workers to study a method of maintaining the taphole to adapt to the conditions of high winds and high temperatures. Also, in the past, some newly built or rebuilt blast furnaces in the plant could not find problems during acceptance, but after being put into production, either the tuyere layout was improper, or the slag outlet was too high or too low. The plant's leading cadres consulted with the furnace builders and furnace workers. The furnace builders said that when we were building the furnace, the furnace workers were not around, and we didn't know how to build it to make it easy to use; the furnace workers said that the cadres and technicians could only see the outer shell during acceptance and couldn't see the inside, so of course they couldn't find the problem! Based on these opinions, the plant made a decision: to give the responsibility for acceptance to the furnace chief and furnace workers. Build the furnace while accepting and correcting it, and then conduct a final acceptance after completion, so that the furnace builders and furnace workers are closely integrated. As a result, each blast furnace has good quality and high output.

　　Extensively Mobilizing the Masses to Offer Suggestions
　　Carefully Handling Suggestions from the Masses
    To guide and persuade, using various forms to mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and plans, is an effective measure for the cadres of Ji'an Steel Plant to consult with the masses on everything. Some workers and the masses often fear that their opinions will not be adopted and that they will lose face. Therefore, some good suggestions are not easily put forward. In response to this situation, in addition to educating cadres to often take the initiative to consult the masses and educating the masses to establish the idea of being masters of their own affairs, the plant's Party committee also adopted various forms such as irregular mass meetings, big-character posters, professional seminars, furnace-side meetings, on-site meetings, experience exchange meetings, "Zhuge Liang" meetings, and individual heart-to-heart talks to guide workers to speak freely, and every opinion has an explanation and a solution. This mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses to actively participate in enterprise management and take the initiative to put forward many beneficial suggestions. For example, in May of this year, under the guidance of cadres, workers throughout the plant put forward more than 10,000 suggestions, from production management to living arrangements. After these suggestions were discussed in special sessions and implemented, the masses saw that their opinions were valued and their enthusiasm was even greater, and the implementation was very thorough. Many things that had not been done well in the past were quickly resolved this time. For example, in the past, the plant did not have a perfect management system for tools and materials, and coke, scrap iron, and tools were scattered everywhere, resulting in great waste. This time, the masses sharply criticized this phenomenon in big-character posters. The plant's cadres immediately adopted the form of special research and consulted with the masses to guide the masses to discuss how to cherish state property, reduce losses, and reduce costs. The workers and the masses put forward many useful opinions and formulated a complete set of tool and material management systems. Now, not even a piece of scrap iron can be seen being thrown away.

    Now, the broad masses of cadres at the Ji'an Steel Plant have personally experienced the tremendous vitality of the Party's mass line in consulting with the masses. They have turned consulting on everything into a conscious action, a necessary system in their working methods, and have formed a new atmosphere of "sharing weal and woe with the workers and consulting with the masses on everything." The broad masses have also further established the idea of being masters of their own affairs, and they take the initiative to find cadres to study as soon as something happens, treating the work of the cadres as their own work and treating the problems in the plant's production as their own family affairs. Cadres and the masses are united without gaps, and everyone responds to a call. Work is proactive everywhere, production is smooth, and steel production is getting higher and higher.

### 全体干部事事和群众同谋共议　吉安钢铁厂生产全面上升不断上升

　　全体干部事事和群众同谋共议
　　吉安钢铁厂生产全面上升不断上升
    本报南昌10日电　江西省吉安钢铁厂广大干部，大力改进工作方法，事事与群众商量，工作越做越细，群众干劲越鼓越足，钢铁生产越跃越高。6月份同5月份比较，小高炉平均利用系数由一以下上升到二以上；生铁日产量由五十吨提高到一百多吨；生铁合格率由80％以下提高到90％以上；焦比由一点五下降到一以下。
　　过去日夜跟班劳动
　　却同群众貌合神离
    吉安钢铁厂的干部，大部分都是在1958年大办钢铁的群众运动中成长起来的，他们一直保持着与群众同吃同住同劳动的良好习惯。但随着钢铁生产的迅速发展，出现了干部工作方法与形势不相适应的新情况。有些干部虽然日夜在炉边跟班劳动，但缺少和群众商量，往往凭着个人的经验和看法指挥生产。因而生产中的新问题不能及时了解，发现了问题也不能迅速解决。厂党委发现这一情况后，在中共吉安地委、市委的领导下，一面继续率领干部深入生产第一线，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动；另一方面，则采取了一系列措施，大力改进干部的工作方法，做到了时时事事和群众同商量。
　　政治挂帅教育干部
　　真正相信群众力量
　　坚持政治挂帅，教育广大干部从思想上相信群众力量，认识事事同群众商量的重要意义，是吉安钢铁厂干部工作方法获得显著改进的重要原因。厂党委针对部分干部的骄傲自满、自以为是的错误思想，一面组织干部重新学习了党的群众路线的各种文件和指示，展开了一场大辩论，通过辩论，使干部从理论上认识到群众的巨大力量，懂得了有事和群众商量是搞好工作的一项法宝，另一面则以许多好坏不同的典型事例，教育和启发了广大干部，更深刻体会到多和群众商量的现实意义，从而在干部中全面实行了“四同”：同吃同住同劳动同商量，全厂从书记、厂长、科室领导、工段长一直到一般干部，都分片包干，到炉边工地安家落户，在工作中谦虚踏实，事事同群众商量，使工作越做越细。如一工段段长陈勇，工作积极负责、雷厉风行；但过去有些自以为是。他在领导十四号高炉生产时，铁水常常过早冲出出铁口，自己想不出好办法，又不同工人商量，问题总是解决不了。这次作风大大改变了。他在十五号高炉领导生产中，碰到了同样问题，就主动找炉前工共同研究。炉前工说，我们的出铁口还是按照一般风温、风量设计的，现在大风高温了，滚烫的铁水关不住。陈勇同志得到很大启发，立即同工人一起研究了一项维护出铁口的办法，适应了大风高温的情况。又如过去厂里有些新建改建的高炉，验收时发现不了问题，投入生产后，不是风口摆布不当，就是渣口偏高偏低。厂里领导干部就向筑炉工、炉前工请教。筑炉工说，我们筑炉时炉前工又不在身边，不知怎样砌才顺手；炉前工说，干部、技术员验收时，只能看到外壳，看不到内部，当然找不出毛病罗！根据这些意见，厂里作了一条决定：把验收责任交给炉长和炉前工。边筑炉边验收边改正，建成后再作一次总验收，使筑炉工与炉前工紧密结合了起来。结果，座座高炉质量好、产量高。
　　广泛发动群众献计
　　认真处理群众建议
    循循善诱，用多种形式发动群众献计献策，是吉安钢铁厂干部与群众同谋共议的一项有效措施。有些工人群众常怕自己的意见不被采纳，会失面子，因此，有些好的建议也不肯轻易提出来。厂党委针对这一情况，除了教育干部经常主动向群众请教、教育群众树立当家作主思想以外，还采取了不定期的大鸣大放大字报、专业座谈会、炉边会、现场会、经验交流会、“诸葛亮”会、个别谈心等多种形式，引导工人畅所欲言，并且条条意见有交代有着落，从而调动了群众积极
  参加企业管理的热情，主动提出了许多有益的建议。如今年5月间，全厂工人在干部的引导下，从生产管理到生活安排，提出了一万多条建议。这些建议经过专题讨论付诸实施后，群众看见自己的意见得到重视，干劲更大，执行得也很彻底，许多过去没办好的事，这次都很快得到了解决。如过去厂里的工具、材料等没有一个完善的管理制度，焦炭、碎铁、工具丢得遍地都是，浪费很大。这次群众在大字报上尖锐地批评了这种现象。厂里干部立即采取专题研究的形式，与群众同谋共议，引导群众讨论如何爱护国家财产，减低损耗，降低成本。工人群众提出了许多有益的意见，同时制订了一整套工具、材料管理制度。现在一块丢掉的碎铁都看不到了。
    现在吉安钢铁厂的广大干部，在同群众商量中切身体验到了党的群众路线的巨大生命力，他们已经把事事同商量变成了一种自觉的行动，工作方法上的一项必需的制度，形成了“与工人同甘共苦，与群众同谋共议”的新风气。广大群众也进一步树立了当家作主的思想，一有事就主动找干部研究，以干部的工作当作自己的工作来做，把厂里生产中的问题当作自己家里的事情去办。干群团结无间，一呼百应。工作处处主动，生产顺手，钢铁产量越来越高。（附图片）
