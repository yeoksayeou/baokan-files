Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 18th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro delivered a televised speech tonight condemning the United States' conspiracy to isolate Cuba in order to launch further aggression against it.

Castro pointed out that, in order to achieve the above goals, the United States is attempting to cancel the discussion of Cuba's accusations against US aggression in the United Nations Security Council, and transfer the issue to the Organization of American States, because this organization is controlled by the United States and composed of some vassal states.

Castro exposed the conspiratorial means adopted by the United States against Latin American countries. He pointed out that the United States is attempting to buy off the governments of these countries with promises of economic "aid," and is also negotiating with some of them to distribute the expropriated Cuban sugar import quotas, in exchange for their cooperation in the US plan to aggress against the Cuban revolution. Castro emphasized that the purpose of the so-called "aid" plan of the United States is to undermine the support of the Latin American people for the Cuban revolution and to divide the victims of the encroachment of the American oligarchic imperialism—the Latin American people.

Castro refuted the argument put forward by some Latin American governments that the so-called Soviet Union's provision of assistance to Cuba is interference in the affairs of the American continent by a power outside the continent. He said that those who absurdly attempt to make Cuba refuse the support provided by the Soviet Union against real aggressors are actually suggesting that Cuba put its neck under the axe of the United States, so that those who come to help it dare not come to help it again, and make itself isolated.

Castro said that the Soviet Union has never invaded any country. However, the US government has committed numerous acts of aggression against the Latin American people. Castro asked, there are aggressors on our own continent, and it is the aggressors on this continent that should be stopped, especially in the current Cuba to stop these aggressors. He pointed out that the weapons used to aggress against Cuba could also be used to aggress against any Latin American country that decides to take an independent path.

Prime Minister Castro said that the United States is trying to invoke the Monroe Doctrine to make itself entitled to engage in piracy in the Americas. The United States is attempting to use the Monroe Doctrine to turn Latin American countries into protectorates of the United States. Castro emphasized that the revolutionary government, in response to the discredited and decadent Monroe Doctrine, declares that the people of the Americas have the right to choose their own government. Cuba refuses any protection or protectorate status that the United States attempts to force it to accept.

Finally, Castro said that if the United States achieves the goal of referring Cuba's accusations in the United Nations to the Organization of American States, Cuba will continue to fight in the Organization of American States. Castro emphasized that the Cuban people are determined to defend their homeland and defeat the aggressors, and they will neither surrender nor betray.

Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: New York News: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 18th to discuss the situation caused by the aggressive actions of the United States against Cuba. This meeting was held at the request of Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa.

Raúl Roa made a long speech at the meeting, in which he pointed out: "The threat of armed aggression by the United States against Cuba is increasing every day."

The Cuban Foreign Minister accused the United States of interference and aggression against Cuba. He condemned the United States' attempt to isolate and destroy the Cuban revolution, and condemned the United States for dealing with Cuba in the same way it did when it subverted the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954. In this regard, Raúl Roa emphasized that the United States is preparing to launch armed aggression against Cuba. However, Raúl Roa said, Cuba is not Guatemala; history will not repeat itself.

Raúl Roa pointed out that the United States is spreading lies that Cuba is a so-called "pawn of international communism" in order to destroy the principles of the Cuban revolution and to create excuses for the US aggression, slander, and retaliatory actions against Cuba. Raúl Roa refuted the recent slander by US Undersecretary of State Dillon that Cuba is a so-called "ideological satellite state of the Soviet Union" and the lies spread by other US officials about the Soviet Union establishing bases in Cuba. He said that the only foreign military base currently in Cuba is a US base. There, the United States docks submarines and stations jet planes and Marines.

The Cuban Foreign Minister accused the United States of harboring Cuban war criminals and encouraging these war criminals, concentrated in Miami, Florida, in the United States, to violate Cuban airspace and throw US-made incendiary bombs to burn Cuban sugarcane fields. He also condemned US pilots for violating Cuban airspace to smuggle Cuban criminals, and planes taking off from the United States for throwing bombs at Cuban Prime Minister Castro's residence in Havana. He said, "These planes, sheltered by the US authorities, have caused Cuba's economy to lose 350,000 tons of sugarcane and have sacrificed several lives."

Raúl Roa accused the United States of not only embargoing its own weapons to Cuba, but also influencing the governments of other countries not to provide weapons to Cuba. He said that the United States has created an atmosphere of aggression and tension, causing the Cuban people to suffer from these conspiracies.

The Cuban Foreign Minister strongly condemned the United States' reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota as an "arbitrary act of economic aggression."

Raúl Roa also accused the United States of taking economic aggressive actions such as revoking loans to Cuban banks, freezing Cuban bank accounts, and instructing US oil companies in Cuba to stop providing oil to Cuba.

Raúl Roa said, "In short, a big country violates its treaty obligations to undermine the sovereignty, happiness, and progress of a small country, thereby endangering peace and security and exacerbating international tensions."

Raúl Roa emphasized that as the economic pressure exerted by the United States on Cuba increases, the threat of armed aggression by the United States against Cuba increases every day. He said that the anger of the United States resulting from its failure to exert economic pressure on Cuba "prompted the US government to declare an economic war on the 'Cuban' revolutionary government, promote collective armed action against Cuba within the Organization of American States, vainly attempt to obtain the cooperation of Latin America, and exhume the Monroe Doctrine from the tomb with hegemonic ideas in order to defend its interests by imposing the threat of intervention." Roa pointed out that the United States adopted such a belligerent tone in its attitude that it aroused strong warnings from the Soviet Union.

Raúl Roa asked righteously, "The question arises: Who is interfering in the internal affairs of this hemisphere? Is it the big country that uses all its military power to threaten a small unarmed country, or another big country that takes steps to stop this situation?" In his speech, Raúl Roa exposed the conspiracy of the United States to prevent the Security Council from discussing Cuba's accusations against the United States. He said that the idea that the dispute between Cuba and the United States should first be submitted to the Organization of American States for discussion is an "absurd and illegal idea." Cuba has every right to accuse the United States of interference and aggression against Cuba in the United Nations.

Finally, Raúl Roa said that it is not easy to threaten and suppress the Cuban people. Cuba is determined to resist all aggressors who dare to appear on its shores. Cuba is not isolated, its destiny is linked to the destiny of all economically backward countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa.

US Representative Lodge, in his speech at the meeting, tried his best to deny the US interference and aggression against Cuba, and clamored that "the Security Council should not take any action on Cuba's accusations," attempting to submit the dispute between Cuba and the United States to the US-controlled Organization of American States, so that the United States could instigate further interference in Cuba at the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries to be held by the Organization of American States.

In his speech, Lodge shamelessly whitewashed and said that "the United States has no aggressive intentions towards Cuba," but on the other hand, he clamored that the United States will "vigorously defend" the "Monroe Doctrine principles" used by the United States to control and enslave Latin American countries, and brazenly stated that the United States will use the Charter of the Organization of American States and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, the big sticks in the hands of US interventionists, to take further intervention actions against Cuba under the banner of "anti-communism."

Argentine Representative Mario Amadeo then spoke at the meeting. He said that the Argentine delegation and the Ecuadorian delegation had submitted a proposal to the Security Council, suggesting that the Security Council "suspend consideration" of Cuba's accusations against the United States until it receives a report from the Organization of American States.

The Polish representative spoke at the end of the meeting, saying that the actions of the United States and its show of force near Cuba and its borders endangered peace in this region of the world. The Polish representative said that he reserved the right to speak later on the proposal put forward by Argentina and Ecuador.

Representatives from Italy, France, and the United Kingdom pretended not to "see" the US aggression against Cuba. They spoke in favor of ceasing consideration of Cuba's accusations against the United States in the United Nations and referring the matter to the Organization of American States for handling.

The next meeting of the Security Council will be held on July 19.

　　卡斯特罗谴责美国利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴的阴谋
　　古巴人民决心保卫祖国战胜侵略者
　　劳尔·罗亚在联合国安理会控诉美国对古巴的侵略行动
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今晚发表电视演说，谴责美国正在孤立古巴以便进一步对古巴发动侵略的阴谋。
    卡斯特罗指出，为了达到上述目的，美国正企图在联合国安全理事会中取消讨论古巴对美国侵略的控诉，而把问题转到美洲国家组织去，因为这个组织是美国控制的、由一些附庸国家组成的。
    卡斯特罗揭露美国对拉丁美洲国家采取的阴谋手段，他指出，美国企图利用经济“援助”的诺言收买这些国家的政府，此外还同其中某些政府谈判分配被剥夺的古巴的食糖进口份额，来换取它们在美国侵略古巴革命的计划中的合作。卡斯特罗强调指出，美国的所谓“援助”计划追求的目的，是想破坏拉丁美洲人民对古巴革命的支持和分裂美国寡头帝国主义蚕食的牺牲者——拉丁美洲人民。
    卡斯特罗驳斥了某些拉丁美洲国家政府提出的所谓苏联向古巴提供援助是一个大陆以外的强国对美洲大陆事务的干涉这种说法，他说，那些荒唐的企图使古巴拒绝苏联提供的反对真正侵略者的支持的人们，实际上是建议古巴把自己的脖子放在美国的斧头下，使前来援助它的人不敢再来援助它，和使自己陷于孤立。
    卡斯特罗说，苏联从来没有侵略过任何一个国家。但是，美国政府对拉丁美洲人民的侵略却多得很。卡斯特罗问道，在我们自己的大陆上就有侵略者，应该受到制止的是本大陆的侵略者，特别是在目前的古巴来制止这些侵略者。他指出，用以侵略古巴的武器也同样可能用来侵略任何决定走独立道路的拉丁美洲国家。
    卡斯特罗总理说，美国企图祈求门罗主义来使自己有权在美洲进行海盗活动。美国企图利用门罗主义把拉丁美洲国家变成美国的保护国。卡斯特罗强调说，革命政府针对毫无威信和腐朽的门罗主义，宣布美洲人民有权选择自己的政府的主义，古巴拒绝美国企图强迫使它接受的任何保护或保护国地位。
    最后，卡斯特罗说，假如美国达到把古巴在联合国的控诉提到美洲国家组织的目的的话，古巴将在美洲国家组织里继续进行斗争。卡斯特罗强调说，古巴人民决心保卫祖国和战胜侵略者，他既不投降也不会背叛。
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会在18日举行会议，讨论由于美国对古巴的侵略行动所引起的局势。这次会议是应古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚的请求而举行的。
    劳尔·罗亚在会上作了长篇发言，他指出：“美国对古巴进行武装侵略的威胁每天都在加大。”
    古巴外交部长控诉了美国对古巴进行的干涉和侵略行动。他谴责美国企图孤立和摧毁古巴革命，并且谴责美国正在以1954年颠复危地马拉民主政府时所采取的手段来对付古巴。在这方面，劳尔·罗亚强调指出，美国正在准备对古巴发动武装侵略。但是，劳尔·罗亚说，古巴不是危地马拉；历史将不会重演。
    劳尔·罗亚指出，美国散布古巴是所谓“国际共产主义的走卒”等谎言，是为了摧毁古巴革命的原则，并且替美国对古巴的侵略、诽谤和报复行动制造借口。劳尔·罗亚驳斥了美国副国务卿狄龙最近所说的古巴是所谓“苏联的意识形态上的卫星国家”的谰言以及美国其他官员散布的关于苏联正在古巴建立基地的谎言。他说，目前在古巴仅有的一个外国军事基地是美国基地。在那里，美国停泊着潜水艇，驻有喷气式飞机和海军陆战队。
    这位古巴外交部长控诉美国窝藏古巴战犯，并且鼓励这些集中在美国佛罗里达州迈阿密的战犯侵犯古巴领空，投掷美国制造的燃烧弹来焚烧古巴的甘蔗田。他还谴责美国的飞行员侵犯古巴领空去偷运古巴的罪犯，由美国起飞的飞机向哈瓦那的卡斯特罗总理的住宅投掷炸弹。他说，“这些受到美国当局庇护的飞机使古巴经济损失三十五万吨甘蔗，并且使好几个人牺牲了性命。”
    劳尔·罗亚指责美国不仅禁运它自己的武器给古巴，还影响其它国家的政府不向古巴提供武器。他说，美国引起了一种侵略和紧张的气氛，使古巴人民受到这些阴谋的损害。
    古巴外交部长强烈谴责美国削减古巴食糖的进口份额是一种“专横的经济侵略行动”。
    劳尔·罗亚还控诉美国采取诸如撤销对古巴银行的贷款、冻结古巴银行的账目、指使美国在古巴的石油公司停止向古巴提供石油等经济侵略行动。
    劳尔·罗亚说，“简而言之，一个大国违反了它的条约义务去破坏一个小国的主权、幸福和进步，从而危及和平和安全，并且加剧了国际紧张局势。”
    劳尔·罗亚强调说，随着美国对古巴施加的经济压力的日益增加，美国对古巴进行武装侵略的威胁每天都在加大。他说，美国由于对古巴施加经济压力遭到失败而产生的激怒，“促使美国政府宣布对
  ‘古巴’革命政府进行经济战争，在美洲国家组织内促进对古巴的集体武装行动，徒劳地企图获得拉丁美洲的合作，为了保卫它的利益而施加干涉的威胁，带着霸权观念从墓中发掘出门罗主义”。罗亚指出，美国在它的态度中采取这样一种好战的腔调，以致激起苏联的强有力的警告。
    劳尔·罗亚义正词严地问道，
  “由此就产生一个问题：究竟是谁干涉了这个半球的内部事务？是那个以其全部军事力量来对一个没有武装的小国进行胁威的大国呢，还是采取步骤来制止这种情况的另一个大国？”劳尔·罗亚在发言中揭露美国企图阻止安全理事会讨论古巴对美国的控诉的阴谋。他说，那种认为古巴同美国之间的争端应该首先提交美洲国家组织讨论的意见，是一种“荒谬和非法的想法”。古巴完全有权在联合国中控诉美国对古巴的干涉和侵略行动。
    劳尔·罗亚最后说，胁威和镇压古巴人民不是容易的事。古巴断然决定抵抗所有胆敢在它的海岸出现的侵略者。古巴不是孤立的，它的命运同拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲所有经济落后的国家的命运连在一起。
    美国代表洛奇在会上发言时极力抵赖美国对古巴的干涉和侵略行动，并且扬言“安全理事会对古巴的控诉不应采取任何行动”，企图把古巴同美国之间的争端提交由美国控制的美洲国家组织，以便美国在美洲国家组织将要召开的美洲国家外长会议上策动进一步干涉古巴的阴谋。
    洛奇在发言中一方面无耻地粉饰说“美国对古巴并无侵略目的”，另一方面又叫嚷美国将“大力保卫”美国用来控制和奴役拉丁美洲国家的“门罗主义原则”，并且悍然表示，美国将动用美洲国家组织宪章和里约热内卢公约这些美国干涉者手中的大棒，在“反共”的招牌下来对古巴采取进一步的干涉行动。
    阿根廷代表马里奥·阿马德奥接着在会上发言。他说，阿根廷代表团和厄瓜多尔代表团已经向安全理事会提出一项议案，建议安全理事会在接到美洲国家组织提出它的报告以前“暂缓考虑”古巴对美国的控诉。
    波兰代表在会议结束时发言说，美国的行动以及它对古巴和它的边界附近显示武力的做法危及世界这一地区的和平。波兰代表说，他保留晚些时候对阿根廷和厄瓜多尔提出的提案的发言权。
    意大利、法国和英国的代表装作“没有看见”美国对古巴的侵略行为。他们发言赞成停止考虑古巴在联合国中对美国的控诉和把这个问题移交美洲国家组织处理。
    安全理事会下次会议将在7月19日举行。
