The Tianjin Yifeng Stationery Factory, which produces famous brands of mimeograph and typing wax paper, has maintained its reputation for quality first for several years. However, they were not satisfied, and in the first half of this year, they used domestic raw materials to replace imported raw materials and produced better quality wax paper.

The main raw materials for wax paper are high-grade paraffin wax and high-grade Ganpi paper. Paraffin wax depends on imports; Ganpi paper is made from a slow-growing wild mountain cotton and Triadica sebifera bark produced in Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces. The output is very low and cannot fully meet the needs for the time being. Encouraged by the slogan "Producing first-class products with substitute raw materials," technician Ma Yufeng and the workers, after more than three months and more than 40 failures, finally successfully trial-produced new wax paper with substitute raw materials. The heat resistance of the wax paper increased from the original 68 degrees Celsius to about 100 degrees Celsius, and the number of copies that could be printed increased from 2,000 to 4,000, with a maximum of 6,000.

Although the typing wax paper produced by this factory has always maintained the first place in national quality, the shelf life of the wax paper still remains at the level of two to three years. Dong Xiuzhen, a female lab technician who was a worker, discovered after many studies that the key to improving the shelf life of wax paper is to prevent the coating from decomposing by the expiration date. She changed the operating procedures to increase the shelf life of the wax paper to more than five years. (Ji)

    用国产原料生产更好的腊纸
    生产誊写腊纸和打字腊纸名牌产品的天津益丰文具厂，几年来一直保持质量第一的荣誉。但是他们并不满足，今年上半年，他们又用国产原料代替进口原料，生产了质量更好的腊纸。
    腊纸的主要原料是高级石腊和高级雁皮纸。石腊要靠进口；雁皮纸是用云南、贵州等省出产的一种生长很慢的野生山棉和三亚树皮制成，产量很低，一时还不能全部满足需要。在“用代用原料生产第一流产品”的口号鼓舞下，技术员马玉峰和工人们经过三个多月四十多次的失败，终于用代用原料试制成功了新腊纸。腊纸的耐热度由原来的摄氏六十八度提高到一百度左右，耐印份数由两千份提高到四千份，最高达到六千份。
    这个厂生产的打字腊纸虽然一直保持全国质量第一，但腊纸的保险期仍然停留在二至三年的水平。工人出身的女化验员董秀珍经过多次研究，发现提高腊纸保险期的关键是防止涂料到期分解，她就改变了操作工艺，使腊纸的保险期提高到五年以上。　　　（纪）
