Making Daily Necessities from Scraps

    Recently, the Caoyang New Village Store in Shanghai displayed more than one hundred kinds of items made from scrap fabric in its comprehensive utilization sales counter, including pillowcases, curtains, handbags, hats, bibs, and watchbands. These colorful, beautiful, and practical products are all processed by the store's own sewing department.
    The service department of the Caoyang New Village Store is responsible for sewing clothes for more than 60,000 residents in the village. Every day, there are a lot of scraps and leftover pieces from tailoring. In order to utilize these scraps, the employees use their spare time to piece the scraps together and then make them into various useful things, which are very popular with consumers. (Wu Ming)

    用碎布做成日用品
    上海曹杨新村商店，最近在综合利用卖品专柜里，摆出了一百多种碎布拼成的枕套、窗帘、手提包、帽子、围涎和表带等等。这些五颜六色、美观大方的产品，都是这个商店缝纫部自己加工的。
    曹杨新村商店服务部，担负着全村六万多居民的缝衣任务。每天都有不少裁剪下来的碎布、角片。职工们为了把这些碎布都利用起来，他们利用业余时间，把碎布一块一块拼在一起，然后再做成各种有用的东西，很受消费者欢迎。　（吴明）
