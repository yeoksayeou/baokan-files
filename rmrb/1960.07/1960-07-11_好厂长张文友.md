　　Good Factory Director Zhang Wenyou
　　·Our Correspondent·
    "Zhang Wenyou is a good leader, he both directs the battle and participates in the battle." The workers of the Dasha Ping Machinery Factory in Lanzhou praise him like this.
    Zhang Wenyou is the factory's deputy director and a member of the factory's Party committee. He often labors alongside the masses and has established deep feelings with the workers.
    In April of this year, the foundry workshop accepted the task of producing irrigation and drainage pipes. This was the first trial production, and in casting, four or five times in a row, there were either cracks or breaks. Irrigation and drainage pipes were urgently needed equipment for agricultural drought resistance. In order to support agricultural technological transformation, the workers, with great enthusiasm, worked day and night on experiments, but could not find the cause of the cracks. Zhang Wenyou moved from his home to the foundry workshop, eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers, doing experiments together. Every time there was a failure, he would call the workers together to analyze the reasons, again and again concentrating the wisdom of the masses, meticulously exploring experience from practice, and discussing its "secrets." After many analyses and continuous experiments, he initially found some clues, but the reject rate was still very high. It was not possible to conclude which link was the cause. Zhang Wenyou led the workers to visit more than a dozen factories such as the Gansu Agricultural Tool Factory, Lanzhou Electric Motor Factory, and Machine Fitting Factory, and also invited the irrigation pipe "medical" team from the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Bureau to teach technology. Through visiting and learning from experience, the workers' thinking was further enlightened. Then, the gate and riser were improved, and the qualified rate of the pipes gradually increased from 20% to 80%, reaching a maximum of 90%, catching up with the level of advanced factories.
    Zhang Wenyou rarely sits in the office. Whenever he has free time, he goes to the workshop to be a confidant of the masses, which expands his sources of information. Once, he heard a worker say: "The night shift never catches up with the day shift." Meaning that work efficiency cannot be improved. Why can't the night shift catch up with the day shift? This sentence immediately got into Zhang Wenyou's mind.
    From then on, every night when he went home, he would first go to the workshop to take a look. One night, when he was passing by the third workshop on his way home, he saw two workers from the Yu Mingxiao group improving the blanking machine. One said that using a pulley was not good, and the other said that using a gear wheel would be better, but there wasn't one. Zhang Wenyou stood behind them and said, "Using a gear wheel is the best." The worker turned his head and saw that it was Deputy Director Zhang. "Good is good, but where is it?" the worker asked him. "Yes! There is one outside the maintenance group's house, it was removed from the converter, go get it and use it." Zhang Wenyou looked at the blanking machine and turned around, taking the two workers to get the gear wheel, preventing work stoppage due to lack of materials. Another time, the first workshop ran out of materials during the furnace operation, and the furnace was about to be stopped. As soon as Zhang Wenyou arrived at the workshop, he encountered this problem. He asked: "Why didn't you prepare it during the day?" The workers said: "The day shift said it was almost enough, so we didn't check." At this time, it was already late at night. Where to find someone? Zhang Wenyou did not hesitate at all, returned to the office, found more than a dozen people, and in no time, transported three tons of materials. Zhang Wenyou said to the workers before leaving: "Tell this matter to your workshop director, and thoroughly overcome the 'almost' thinking in the future." From this, Zhang Wenyou deeply realized that "the night shift cannot catch up with the day shift" is a man-made reason. According to the reflection that the night shift could not catch up with the day shift and the "almost" thinking, he established a duty system for the workshop Party branch secretary and director, one to take care of the day and one to take care of the night, so that leading cadres would manage production 24 hours a day.
    Because Zhang Wenyou has consistently insisted on being on the front line of production, knows the situation well, grasps the problems accurately, and solves problems quickly, the foundry and forging workshops where he is often located have completed their production tasks very well, leading the entire factory by far. This year, these two workshops were respectively rated as Red Flag Workshop and Champion Workshop. Zhang Wenyou has also been rated as an advanced producer several times.

　　好厂长张文友
　　·本报记者·
    “张文友是个好领导，既指挥战斗，又参加战斗。”兰州市大砂坪机械厂的工人们都这样赞扬他，夸奖他。
    张文友是这个厂的副厂长、厂党委委员。他经常和群众一起劳动，和工人建立了深厚的感情。
    今年4月，铸工车间接受了生产排灌水管的任务。这是第一次试生产，在浇铸中一连四、五次，不是裂口，就是断成几截。排灌水管是农业抗旱的急需设备，为了支援农业技术改造，工人们抱着高度的热情，夜以继日地搞试验，就是找不出裂口的原因。张文友从家里搬到铸工车间，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，一起搞试验。每失败一次，他就把工人叫在一起，分析原因，一次一次集中群众的智慧，一丝不苟地从实践中摸索经验，探讨它的“秘密”。经过多次分析和连续试验，初步摸到一点门路，但废品率仍然很高。究竟是那个环节造成的，一时做不出结论。张文友就领着工人参观了甘肃农具厂、兰州电动机厂、机器制配厂等十多个工厂，同时又请省农业机械局排管“医疗”队传授技术。通过登门拜访，学习经验，进一步启发了工人们的思想，接着改进了浇口和冒口，使排管合格率由20％逐步提高到80％，最高达到90％。赶上了先进厂的水平。
    张文友很少坐在办公室里，一有空，他就往车间里跑，作群众的知心朋友，这样就使他扩大了耳目。有一次，他听到工人说：“夜班总是赶不上白班。”意思是工作效率提不高。夜班为什么赶不上白班？这句话一下就钻进张文友的脑子里。
    打这以后，他每天晚上回家都先要到车间里去看看。一天晚上，他回家路过三车间时，看到愈明孝小组两个工人正在改进下料机，一个说用皮带轮不行，一个说用牙齿轮倒好，就是没有。张文友站在他们的背后说：“用牙齿轮最好。”工人扭头一看，原来是张副厂长。“好是好，哪里有呢？”工人向他提出了问题？“有！维修组的房子外边有，是从转炉上拆下来的，你们去拿来用吧。”张文友看了看下料机，转身带着两个工人就把牙齿轮取来了，防止了停工待料。还有一次，一车间在开炉中缺料了，眼看要停炉。张文友一走到车间，便碰到这个问题。他问：“为什么白天不准备好？”工人们说：“干白班的说差不多了，我们也就没检查。”这时，已经是后半夜了。到哪里去找人呢？张文友丝毫没有犹豫，回到办公室，找来十多个人，不大功夫，就运来了三吨料，张文友临走时对工人们说：“把这件事告诉你们车间主任，以后要彻底克服‘差不多’的思想”。从这里，张文友深深体会到：“夜班赶不上白班”是人为的原因。他根据夜班赶不上白班和“差不多”的思想反映，建立了车间党支部书记、主任值班制度，一个抓白天，一个抓晚上，领导干部二十四小时都管生产。
    由于张文友一贯坚持在生产第一线，了解情况多，对问题抓的准，解决问题快，他经常所在的铸工、锻工两个车间，生产任务完成的很出色，在全厂遥遥领先。今年这两个车间都分别被评为红旗车间和冠军车间。张文友也几次被评为先进生产者。
