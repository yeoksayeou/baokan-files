Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. The CCP Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee has strengthened its leadership over agricultural production, and agricultural production in southern Xinjiang is developing rapidly.

Recently, Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the CCP Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, returned from an inspection tour of southern Xinjiang. He said: The agricultural production situation in southern Xinjiang is excellent this year, with three earlies, three mores, and three goods. Spring plowing and spring sowing were appropriately earlier than in previous years, and current field management and mid-season hoeing are also generally earlier. There has been a lot of land reclamation in southern Xinjiang this year, and the planting area has greatly developed; more farmland water conservancy projects were built this spring, and the water needed for production has also increased compared to the past. Because the sowing quality of spring-sown crops is generally good, not only is wheat growing well now, but autumn-harvested crops are also generally growing well, laying a foundation for a bumper harvest.

The southern Xinjiang region includes the four prefectures of Korla, Aksu, Kashgar, and Hotan south of the Tianshan Mountains, as well as the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture. The region is vast, with a mild climate and many fertile oases, making it Xinjiang's main agricultural area. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 has greatly changed the face of agricultural production in southern Xinjiang. In the two years, the cultivated land area in the region expanded by more than 5 million mu, the farming technology caught up with the advanced Han areas, and the total output and per unit yield of grain and cotton both increased significantly.

This year, the Autonomous Region Party Committee emphasized the implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to take agriculture as the foundation and accelerate the development of agriculture, especially grain production. The southern Xinjiang region launched a large-scale land reclamation and farmland creation campaign while repairing water conservancy facilities in the spring. In the past five months, according to statistics from the people's communes in the four regions of Hotan, Kashgar, Aksu, and Kizilsu, and the military reclamation farms in southern Xinjiang, a total of more than 2.6 million mu of land have been reclaimed. Among them, Hotan Prefecture, with a population of only 800,000, has reclaimed more than 1 million mu, which is more than the total amount of land reclaimed in the past ten years. Every rural commune and every production team in southern Xinjiang has expanded its cultivated land this year through land reclamation. At the same time, the planting area of various crops in southern Xinjiang has also expanded this year. The wheat planting area has reached 7 million mu, and spring-sown crops such as corn, cotton, and oil crops have also been planted more than in previous years. The sowing quality of various crops has been improved. Because the wheat is planted well and managed well, now the ears are numerous and uniform, a scene of a bumper harvest. Most of the corn in the region has adopted advanced square-nesting planting techniques, and all 800,000 mu of cotton fields in Kashgar Prefecture have been gardenized. At present, these spring-sown crops have full and strong seedlings, basically eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges that were more common in previous years. Now, the wheat in southern Xinjiang is ripe, and the fragrance is spreading for miles; more than 3 million people of all ethnic groups are joyfully engaging in the battle of harvesting wheat.

The rapid development of agricultural production in southern Xinjiang is inseparable from the fact that party organizations at all levels have done a good job in arranging the lives of farmers. At present, the living situation in rural southern Xinjiang is also very good. Due to the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, counties in southern Xinjiang now have grain reserves. Rural public canteens generally eat their fill and eat well. Because living conditions have improved, people are energetic and enthusiastic, and they are determined to further improve this year's agricultural production.

The current focus in southern Xinjiang is to continue to vigorously grasp agricultural production. First of all, we must increase grain production and increase grain reserves. Wang Enmao said: With more grain, we can both support national construction and develop local industry, transportation, and animal husbandry production faster. Increasing grain production is a matter of strategic significance. However, while increasing grain production, the twelve words of grain, cotton, oil, and hemp must have a reasonable layout and comprehensive development. This requires further land reclamation to expand the cultivated land area. There are three forces in land reclamation in southern Xinjiang: mainly the people's communes, followed by military reclamation farms and local state-owned farms. Southern Xinjiang will further carry out the mass movement of land reclamation by people's communes, work hard when busy with farming, and work hard when idle from farming, striving to double the cultivated land area in southern Xinjiang in two or three years.

Now, leading cadres at all levels in southern Xinjiang have further strengthened their leadership over agricultural production in accordance with Wang Enmao's instructions; while leading the harvesting of wheat and field management of spring-sown crops, they have led people's communes in various places to draw some labor to continue land reclamation, preparing to expand the planting of late autumn crops, and strive for a bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops this year. In order to develop agricultural production in southern Xinjiang faster and better, cadres in various places in southern Xinjiang have gone deep into the grassroots level, adhering to the principles of eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses. At the same time, various places have also strengthened the leadership of rural public canteens and labor arrangements, determined to further grasp the lives of commune members to ensure the continued leap forward in production.

### 在主要农业区突出抓粮食生产  新疆维吾尔自治区党委加强南疆地区领导

    在主要农业区突出抓粮食生产
    新疆维吾尔自治区党委加强南疆地区领导
    新华社乌鲁木齐讯　中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委加强了对农业生产的领导，南疆地区的农业生产正迅速向前发展。
    最近，中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委第一书记王恩茂视察南疆归来。他说：今年南疆的农业生产形势极好，出现了三早、三多和三好。春耕、春播都比往年有适当提早，当前的田间管理、中耕锄草工作也普遍提早了。今年南疆地区开荒很多，播种面积有很大的发展；今春兴修农田水利工程，生产所需的水也比过去增多了。由于春播作物的播种质量普遍好，现在不仅小麦长得好，秋收作物也普遍长得好；打下了丰收的基础。
    南疆地区包括天山以南的库尔勒、阿克苏、喀什、和田四个专区和克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州等，地区辽阔，气候温和，有很多肥沃的绿洲，是新疆的主要农业区。1958和1959两年跃进，南疆农业生产的面貌已经有了很大的改变。两年间全区耕地面积扩大了五百多万亩，耕作技术赶上了先进的汉族地区，粮、棉的总产量和单产都有较大增长。
    今年，自治区党委强调贯彻执行党中央和毛主席的以农业为基础的指示，加速发展农业特别是粮食生产。南疆地区在春修水利的同时展开了大规模的开荒造田运动。五个月来，仅据和田、喀什、阿克苏、克孜勒苏四个地区的人民公社，和南疆各地军垦农场统计，共开荒二百六十多万亩。其中只有八十万人口的和田专区已开荒达一百多万亩，比过去十年开荒的总和还多。南疆的每一个农村公社、每一个生产队，今年都开荒扩大了自己的耕地。与此同时，今年南疆各种农作物的播种面积也有扩大。小麦种植面积已达七百万亩，玉米、棉花、油料等春播作物也种的比往年多。各种作物的播种质量都提高了。小麦由于种得好和管得好，现在穗多整齐，一片丰收景象。全区大部分玉米都采用了先进的方形窝播，喀什专区的八十万亩棉田全部实现了园田化。目前这些春播作物苗全苗壮，基本上消灭了往年较普遍的缺苗断垅现象。现在，南疆小麦已经成熟，千里飘香；三百多万各族人民正以喜悦的心情投入了收麦的战斗。
    南疆农业生产的迅速发展，是和各级党组织抓好了农民的生活安排分不开的。目前，南疆农村的生活形势也很好。由于过去两年的跃进，现在南疆各县都有了粮食储备。农村公共食堂普遍吃得饱、吃得好。由于生活得到改善，人们精神焕发，干劲高昂，一心要进一步搞好今年的农业生产。
    当前南疆的中心是继续狠抓农业生产。首先要增产粮食，增加粮食的储备。王恩茂说：粮食多了，既能支援国家建设，又能更快地发展地方工业、交通和畜牧生产。增产粮食是一个具有战略意义的问题。但在增产粮食的同时，粮棉油麻等十二个字必须有合理的布局，全面发展。这就要进一步开荒扩大耕地的面积。南疆开荒有三支力量，主要是人民公社，其次是军垦农场和地方国营农场。南疆各地将进一步开展人民公社开荒的群众运动，农忙小干，农闲大干，争取两三年内把南疆的耕地面积扩大一倍左右。
    现在，南疆各级领导干部根据王恩茂的指示都进一步加强了对农业生产的领导；在领导收麦和春播作物田间管理的同时，领导各地人民公社抽调了部分劳动力继续开荒，准备扩大晚秋作物的播种，力争今年夏秋作物全面丰收。为更快更好发展南疆的农业生产，南疆各地干部都已纷纷深入基层，坚持与广大群众同吃、同住、同劳动和同商量。同时各地也加强了对农村公共食堂和劳动安排的领导，决心进一步抓好社员群众的生活，来保证生产继续跃进。
