　　Wheat Harvest Scene
　　Sister-in-law Jiang Xianqing is skilled at sharpening sickles, sharpening them to welcome the wheat harvest; good tools for good hands, showing the skills of wheat-cutting heroes. The secretary cuts wheat in the fields, with commune members wielding hoes closely behind; leaders personally participate in the battle, boosting everyone's morale. Golden wheat gleams, the wheat-cutting army heads to the battlefield; city and countryside are one family, mutual support is the right thing to do. The commune canteen is truly good, the food is fragrant and plentiful; medical staff travel together, unafraid to run to the fields.

　　麦收场景
　　蒋贤清大嫂手巧磨镰刀，磨快镰刀迎麦收；好武器给好手用，割麦英雄显身手。书记割麦在田头，社员挥锄紧跟后；领导亲自来参战，大家更加有劲头。麦子黄黄闪金光，割麦大军上战场；城乡本是一家人，互相支援理应当。公社食堂真是好，饭菜香来吃得饱；医务人员结伴行，送往田头不怕跑。
