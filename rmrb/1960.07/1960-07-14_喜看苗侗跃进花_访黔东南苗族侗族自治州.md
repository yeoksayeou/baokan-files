　　Happily Watching the Leap Forward Flowers of the Miao and Dong Peoples
　　——Visiting the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture
　　Wu Kejian
　　Amidst the nationwide leap forward, our Miao and Dong brothers, holding high the three red banners, are planted on the Guizhou plateau, about 1,000 meters above sea level. Under the fluttering red banners, the Miao and Dong brothers, together with the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups, are striving mightily to achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in 1960, catching up with the highest levels of the advanced regions of the country!
　　The Miao people living in Guizhou Province number 1.6 million, the province with the largest Miao population in China. And Southeast Guizhou is the area where the Miao people are most concentrated in Guizhou. In Southeast Guizhou, there are 730,000 Miao people, accounting for 37.08% of the total population of the prefecture; more than 470,000 Dong people, accounting for 24.08%; and more than 120,000 Bouyei, Zhuang, Shui, Gelao, Yao, and other ethnic minorities, accounting for 6.2%, while more than 640,000 Han people account for 32.6%.
　　Before liberation, Southeast Guizhou was truly a dark "living hell." The reactionary rulers and landlord class of past generations rode roughshod over the people, arbitrarily exploiting the peasants, and creating ethnic divisions, contradictions, and disputes, causing distrust among ethnic groups. Fights often broke out over issues such as water resources and marriage, from which the reactionaries profited.
　　Today, ten years after liberation, Southeast Guizhou has undergone tremendous changes. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and by resolutely implementing the Party's ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are as close as one family, and socialist construction has achieved great successes. In particular, after the continuous leap forward of 1958 and 1959, the material and spiritual outlook of Southeast Guizhou has been completely renewed. The highland mountainous areas have achieved high yields and bumper harvests. The grain output of the Southeast Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture has risen sharply. In 1958, it was 2 billion jin, an increase of 38% over the 1.45 billion jin in 1957, equivalent to 2.8 times the highest annual output of 700 million jin before liberation. Although 1959 suffered the worst drought and insect plague in decades, the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Party, established the idea that "man can conquer nature," relied on the strong vitality of the people's communes, and fought against natural disasters for nearly 100 days, finally overcoming the disasters and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain. Last year, the total grain output reached 2.55 billion jin, an increase of 27.5% over the great leap forward of 1958. Among them, the average yield of rice per mu reached more than 800 jin. Many areas that were previously considered backward have leapt to become advanced areas. This year's summer crops have also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.
　　"Early start" is one of the reasons for the unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops. Some counties started planting wheat as early as August 18th last year, about 50 days earlier than in previous years. In sowing, they generally grasped the main links such as deep (more than eight inches), fertile (more than 9,600 jin of base fertilizer per mu), and dense (row spacing of six to seven inches, sowing width of three to four inches). At the same time, they also promoted a series of effective measures such as "eight fixings" (fixing leaders, fixing personnel, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing quality, fixing remuneration, fixing rewards and punishments, and regularly checking and comparing), "six establishments" (communes establish wheat field management headquarters, high-yield dams establish Party and Communist Youth League branches, technical research groups, red and expert schools, fertilizer plants), "five managements" (communes manage large dams, management districts manage medium-sized dams, production teams manage small dams, small teams manage sections, and commune members manage plots), and "five to the fields" (indicators implemented to the fields, measures implemented to the fields, inspections and comparisons implemented to the fields, technical guidance implemented to the fields), and a responsibility system that manages everything to the end. Commune members said: "The bumper harvest depends entirely on the great strength of the commune, and from now on, the bumper harvest is determined by man, not by heaven."
　　This year's rice transplanting started early and progressed quickly. As of June 6, the prefecture had completed 84% of the planned area for transplanting, of which the machine-transplanted area reached 40%. Rongjiang and Liping counties exceeded the plan by 5% to 3% respectively; Jianhe and Jinping counties completed more than 90% of the plan. At the same time, the area with a density of 25,000 to 30,000 seedlings per mu accounted for about 86%. At the same time, rice management has been generally improved. All counties in the prefecture have carried out general field surveys. Deficiencies of seedlings were promptly remedied, to ensure that not an inch of land is wasted.
　　It is worth pointing out that the water conservancy work in the prefecture has played a significant role in both past production increases and future bumper harvests. Over the past few years, the prefecture has vigorously built water conservancy projects. In 1958 and 1959, a total of 63,031 large and small water conservancy projects were built, with a total water diversion and storage capacity of 508 million cubic meters, equivalent to the total of the seven years from 1950 to 1957. Since last winter, a mass water conservancy construction movement has been launched throughout the prefecture, and great achievements have been made after three months of hard work. By the end of March this year, 1,815 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects had been completed (including 43 backbone projects with a water storage capacity of more than 500,000 cubic meters), with a water storage capacity of 38.069 million cubic meters and an irrigated area of 520,554 mu. After all these projects are fully utilized, plus the original water conservancy facilities, the water storage capacity can reach about 1.5 billion cubic meters, with an average of more than 600 cubic meters per mu of rice paddy. Under normal circumstances, the drought resistance capacity can reach 60 to 80 days.
　　All of the above, grasping political ideology and specific measures, have laid a good foundation for this year's large-scale increase in grain production.
　　The Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has not only achieved brilliant achievements on the agricultural front, but also achieved impressive victories on the industrial front. It can be said that Southeast Guizhou's industry had no foundation before liberation. The prefecture only had some scattered small handicrafts and four incomplete small power plants. After the continuous leap forward of 1958 and 1959, there are now 38 prefecture-run industrial plants, 127 county-run industrial plants, and 1,602 commune-run industrial plants. The number of employees in 1959 was nearly five times larger than in 1957. In terms of production projects, such as open-hearth iron smelting, open-hearth coking, hydropower generation, machine-made paper, textiles, chemicals, sulfuric acid production, machine manufacturing, and automobile repair and assembly, all have developed from scratch, from small to large, and from low to high. Southeast Guizhou had never produced an ounce of iron and steel in its history. From the great iron and steel making campaign of the whole Party and the whole people in 1958, it leapt to become a region that exports iron and steel. Raw coal production in 1959 increased by 2.4% over 1958, and more than 18 times over 1957. Power generation in 1959 increased by 49% over 1958, and more than 35 times over 1952. Machine manufacturing and metal processing increased by 45% in 1959 compared with 1958. Forestry and chemical industry is the industry with the most promising future in the Southeast Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture. So far, the ones that can be produced in large quantities include 23 kinds of wild plant oils, tannin extract, rosin, kerosene, and diesel oil. Two hundred and fifty new varieties of light industry have been added. Because of this, the total industrial output value in 1959 increased by 63% over 1958, 5.4 times over 1957, and 26.5 times over 1949.
　　The Southeast Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture has achieved a leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and has gained rich experience in the continuous leap forward of the past two years, proving that it is necessary to rely on the strong leadership of the Party to implement the Party's correct policies and ethnic policies. The Party organizations in Southeast Guizhou resolutely rejected the arguments that ethnic minorities in the highland mountainous areas are backward, that they cannot leap forward, and that they cannot achieve high yields. Although they understood that China was "poor and blank," and Southeast Guizhou was even poorer and blanker, they firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instructions:
　　"A blank sheet of paper has no burden. It is easy to write the newest and most beautiful words, and to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures." Sure enough, isn't the newest and most beautiful page of the Miao, Dong, and other ethnic brothers being written in the history of the Southeast Guizhou area, which has many mountains, forests, a mild climate, and abundant rainfall, covering 26,000 square kilometers? Isn't it drawing the newest and most beautiful flowers of the leap forward?

　　喜看苗侗跃进花
　　——访黔东南苗族侗族自治州
　　吴克坚
    在全国跃进声中，我们弟兄苗族侗族，高举三面红旗，插上在拔海一千公尺左右的贵州的高原上。在红旗的飘扬下，苗族侗族兄弟正和汉族等兄弟民族一起，千军万马，风起云涌似的为实现1960年更好更全面的继续跃进，赶上全国先进地区最高水平而顽强地奋斗！
    居住在贵州省的苗族计有一百六十万，是我国苗族居住最多的省份。而黔东南又是贵州苗族聚居最多的地方。黔东南有苗族七十三万人，占全州人口的37.08％；侗族四十七万多人，占24.08％；布依、僮、水、?、?等少数民族共有十二万多人，占6.2％，而汉族六十四万多人，占32.6％。
    解放前的黔东南，真是个黑暗的“活地狱”，历代反动统治者和地主阶级，骑在人民头上，任意剥削农民，并且制造民族隔阂、矛盾和纠纷，使民族之间互不信任，经常在为争山水、婚姻等问题上发生械斗，反动派却从中得利。
  解放十年后的今天，黔东南是大大变了样，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的民族政策，全州各族人民亲如一家，社会主义的建设，取得了伟大的成就。特别是经过1958年和1959年的持续跃进，黔东南的物质精神面貌更是焕然一新。高原山区，达到了高产丰收。黔东南自治州的粮食产量，直线上升。1958年为二十亿斤，比1957年的十四亿五千万斤，增长了38％，相当于解放前最高年产量七亿斤的二点八倍。1959年虽然遭受到几十年来最大的旱灾和虫灾，但是广大人民群众在党的领导下，树立了“人定胜天”的思想，依靠人民公社的强大生命力，与自然灾害搏斗近百天，终于战胜了灾害，获得了粮食空前丰收。去年的粮食总产量达到二十五亿五千万斤，比大跃进的1958年增长27.5％。其中水稻平均亩产达到八百斤以上。许多过去所谓边沿落后的地区，一跃而为先进地区。今年夏季作物又获得了空前丰收。
    “抓得早”，是夏季作物空前丰收原因之一。有的县份从去年8月18日就开始种小麦，比往年提早五十天左右。在播种中，他们普遍抓住深（八寸以上）、肥（每亩底肥九千六百多斤）、密（行距六—七寸、播幅三—四寸）等主要环节。同时还推行“八定”（定领导、定人员、定任务、定时间、定质量、定报酬、定奖惩、定期检查评比），“六建立”（公社建立小麦田间管理指挥部、丰产坝建立党、团支部、技术研究小组、红专学校、化肥厂），“五管理”（公社管理大坝、管理区管中坝、生产队管小坝、小队管地段、社员管丘块），“五到田”（指标落实到田、措施到田、检查评比到田、技术指导到田）等一系列有效措施和一管到底的责任制度。社员们说：“丰收全靠公社力量大，从此丰收由人不由天。”
    今年插秧工作动手早，进度快，到6月6日止，全州插秧已完成计划面积的84％，其中机种面积达40％，榕江、黎平两县分别超过计划5％至3％；剑河、锦屏两县完成计划90％以上。同时，每亩密度达二万五千至三万窝的面积占86％左右。同时，水稻管理工作普遍提高，全州各县都开展临田普查工作，发现缺株和过稀的现象，都及时补救，保证做到寸土不丢。
    值得指出的是全州的水利工作，这无论对过去增产和今后丰收都起很大的作用。全州几年来，都大力兴修了水利。1958年和1959年共修大小水利工程六万三千零三十一处，共计引蓄水量五亿零八百万方，相当于1950年至1957年七年的总和。去冬十月以来，全州又开展了群众性的兴修水利运动，经过三个月的奋战，取得了巨大的成绩。到今年三月底止，已完成中、小型水利工程一千八百一十五处（其中蓄水五十万方水以上的骨干工程四十三处），蓄水量达三万八千零六点九万立方米，灌溉面积五十二万零五百五十四亩。这些工程全部发挥效力后，加上原有水利设施蓄水量可达十五亿方左右，平均每亩水稻田可达六百方以上。在一般情况下，抗旱能力能达六十至八十天。
    所有以上这些抓政治思想，抓具体措施，这就为今年粮食大增产打下了良好的基础。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州，不仅在农业战线上取得了辉煌的成就，就是在工业战线上也打了漂亮的胜仗，黔东南的工业，在解放前可以说是毫无基础，全州仅有一些零星小手工业和四个残缺不全的小电厂。经过1958年和1959年的连续跃进，现有州办工业三十八个厂，县办工业一百二十七个厂，公社办工业一千六百零二个厂。职工人数1959年比1957年壮大了将近五倍。在生产项目方面如洋法炼铁、洋法炼焦、水力发电、机制纸、纺织、化工、硫酸生产、机器制造、汽车修配等，都是从无到有，从小到大，由低级到高级发展起来的。黔东南在解放前历史上没有产过一斤钢铁，从1958年全党全民大炼钢铁起，一跃而为钢铁外调地区。原煤产量1959年比1958年增长2.4％，比1957年增长18倍多。发电量1959年比1958年增长49％，比1952年增长三十五倍多。机器制造及金属加工1959年比1958年增长45％。林业化工是黔东南自治州最有广阔前途的工业，到目前为止，能大量生产的有野生植物油、栲胶、松香、煤油、柴油等二十三种。轻工业新增品种二百五十种。正因为这样，1959年工业总产值比1958年增长63％，比1957年增长5.4倍，比1949年增长26.5倍。
    黔东南自治州取得了工农业生产的飞跃发展，取得两年多来持续跃进的丰富经验，证明必须依靠党的强有力的领导力量，才能贯彻党的正确方针和民族政策。黔东南的党组织，坚决拒绝了高原山区少数民族落后论，不能跃进，不能高产的论点，他们虽然了解到我国是“一穷二白”，而黔东南是更穷更白的情况，但他们更牢牢记住了毛主席的指示：
  “一张白纸没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”果然，在山多林茂、气候温和和雨量充沛，全州二万六千平方公里的黔东南地区的历史上，不是正写下苗家侗家等民族兄弟的最新最美的一页吗？不是正在画着最新最美的跃进的花朵吗？
