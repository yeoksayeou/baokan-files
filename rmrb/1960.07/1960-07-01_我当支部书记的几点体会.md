    My Few Experiences as a Party Branch Secretary
    Wang Dehe, Secretary of the General Branch of the Yangtan Management Area, Qucun Commune, Houma City, Shanxi

    I am an ordinary Party branch secretary. I used to be a roughneck who couldn't recognize a few basketfuls of characters. I had no education or ability. After liberation, thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, I served successively as the administrative village head, mutual aid group leader, and agricultural cooperative director. After the establishment of the commune, I became the Party general branch secretary of the Yangtan Management Area, which has nine villages and 686 households. Over the years, in terms of work, I have been working hard day and night, doing my best. As for talking about experience, I am afraid I can't say anything substantial. I can only introduce some of my experiences in my work over the past ten years to everyone.

    One Key Opens a Thousand Locks
    -- Delving into Policies and Studying Theory

    If my work has achieved some results, or if I can still do some work for the Party, it is all thanks to the Party's cultivation. I myself only listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, study, study, and study again.

    In the past few years, with an attitude of not being ashamed to ask questions, I have taken people with some culture in the village as my teachers and been their student, studying and delving into things all the time. Therefore, I have not only gone from being semi-literate to reaching the level of a higher elementary school graduate, but also, with the improvement of my cultural level, paid more attention to studying the Party's policies and theories. I have carefully read the Party's important documents, guidelines, policies, and Chairman Mao's many articles in each period. In particular, I have studied many times Chairman Mao's "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and the CPC Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes." I also regularly read more than ten kinds of newspapers and magazines such as "Red Flag," "Forward," "People's Daily," "Shanxi Daily," "Shanxi Peasants' Daily," "Houma Daily," "Good Party Member," "Branch Life," and "Agricultural Knowledge."

    Studying must be persistent. Not only should you study when you are free, but also when you are busy. The busier you are, the more you need to study. As the saying goes, "Sharpening your axe won't delay your work." If the task is urgent, you will make mistakes and take detours if you don't study the policies thoroughly. Only by studying the Party's documents well can you have a clear mind, steer a steady course, and charge forward bravely to win every battle. I have deeply realized this. Therefore, I always insist on studying for one to two hours every day. When planting experimental plots, I study with the cadres. When working in the fields, I study with the commune members. After a late-night meeting, I study for a while under the lamp, piecing things together to make up for the lack of time. Some people have also said this: "Dehe, we are just lower-level cadres. We don't make policies or formulate guidelines. We just do whatever the Party tells us to do. Do you want to become a dragon or a tiger by studying so much?" No, only by studying well can we work well, especially for a Party branch secretary. Only by studying well can we better grasp the Party's policies and work creatively. For example, last year, in studying theory, I clarified the principle of continuous revolution and the stage of revolutionary development, and applied it specifically to the development of pig raising. When formulating the plan, I thought that it was impossible to develop 10,000 pigs in a few days, but it was necessary and objectively possible to build a 10,000-pig farm. Therefore, I proposed to combine long-term planning with phased completion. Everyone agreed to formulate the plan in this spirit. A pig farm was established in a place that could accommodate 10,000 pigs. The pig farm developed rapidly according to the plan. From April last year to now, the pigsties have been expanded from the original 140 to 750.

    Let Everyone Get Together to Come Up with a Good Idea
    -- Giving Play to the Role of Collective Leadership

    There is a folk saying: "One person's plan is not as good as two people's, and three people come up with a good idea." This sentence tells a truth: one person's plan is limited, but collective wisdom is infinite. We Party branch secretaries must never do everything ourselves. We must give play to everyone's wisdom and strengthen the Party's collective leadership. We insist on holding a general branch committee meeting three times a month and a Party member meeting once a month. Every major task is first discussed within the Party, jointly studied, jointly decided, jointly responsible, and jointly implemented. After the communization, some cadres said: "The secretary is in command, the committee members can relax. Whatever you say, we will do." I promptly pointed out this mistake among the cadres, explaining that adhering to collective leadership is always the leadership method of our Party committees at all levels. The secretary is also a member of the collective leadership, and being in command means being in command under collective leadership. Therefore, we have always adhered to this leadership method. Everyone shares the heavy burden, major issues are discussed by everyone. For example, in the early days of the commune, some cadres said: "The scale is large, the economy is prosperous, why live a poor life? We should build offices and meeting rooms." Some said: "When the water rises, the boat floats. Office supplies must also look the part." This was clearly talking about extravagance and ostentation. But I did not immediately criticize this argument. Instead, I brought the issue to the meeting for discussion. The majority believed that we should carry forward the old tradition of hard work and frugality, and live frugally even when we are rich. They criticized the idea of a large commune, a lot of wealth, and spending a lot of money, adhered to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and used more funds to expand reproduction. In the past two years, the money we spent on administrative management fees accounted for 0.16% of the total income.

    You Can Only Get Sea Treasures by Going to the Seabed
    -- Going Deep into the Masses and Relying on the Masses

    It is essential to maintain a thorough and meticulous style of work. Only by going deep into the masses can we rely on the masses. If you stay in the office all day talking about going deep, being meticulous, and following the mass line, it will only remain on paper. I feel that to truly go deep, we must combine work with labor. Approaching the masses can unite the masses and gain the trust of the masses. Every time after a meeting, after arranging the work, I immediately carry my farm tools to the field, participate in labor in a team in a planned and purposeful way, work, eat, and study with everyone. We often hold meetings and work in the fields, insisting that problems that can be solved in the fields should not be solved in the village. Some people worry that participating in labor will affect work, but in fact, it is the opposite. Going deep and participating in production can not only guide production but also do other work well. Even which team and which plot of land is planted well or badly, and how much fertilizer is applied, I remember clearly.

    Through frequent participation in labor, I have become close to the commune members. Whether they are adults or children, they are willing to talk to me. They come to me for advice if they have something to discuss. Yang Kaiye in the east ditch and Li Xuewen in the west ditch, both experienced old farmers and young people, are all my confidants. Whenever I encounter something, I go to the masses to discuss solutions. Last November, there were more than 3,600 pigs in pens in the district. The development of pigs was rapid, but the feed could not keep up. It was late autumn and early winter, and all the grasses were withered and yellow. Where could we find feed? The feeders wanted me to find a solution. I brought the cadres together to study, and also had discussions with the feeders, learned from the experience of other places, and asked everyone to come up with ideas. Through joint discussions, we experimented with using more than ten kinds of processed materials, such as corn cobs, cotton shells, corn stalks, and sorghum stalks, as pig feed. This method was very good. In sixteen days, we stored more than 1.6 million catties, enough to eat for more than half a year.

    From more than ten years of work, I have deeply realized that: "Of all plans, the mass line is the most important; of all abilities, the broad masses are the most capable; leaving the masses, it is difficult to move forward; relying on the masses, we will win every battle." Only by following the mass line in everything and consulting with the masses in everything can we better implement the Party's policies and accomplish various tasks more outstandingly.

    In a Family, Three Things Must Be Approached Tightly First
    -- Grasping the Main Contradiction

    The work of a management area is very busy, and we must be good at arranging it in an orderly manner, making it busy but not chaotic. This requires us to have a center at all times and a focus in everything. What are the center and the focus? I believe that we should focus on doing a good job in production and analyze what is the most important work in this period, that is, what is the main contradiction at present. This is the center. Concentrate superior forces to attack. Other tasks are also deployed simultaneously, with division of labor and responsibility, tasks assigned to people, methods explained, tasks explained, requirements explained, and supervision and inspection. However, the others must revolve around and be subordinate to the center. For the central work, we must personally take charge and keep at it until the expected goal is achieved.

    Last winter, there was a lot of work at that time. The construction of the 10,000-pig farm continued; the Party committee called for carrying out a nationwide technical innovation movement; red professional spare-time education needed to be carried out on a large scale; and wheat management also needed to be grasped tightly. In addition, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the militia, and other systems had many tasks to do. With so much work, if there was no center, nothing would be accomplished. So, I convened a general branch committee to analyze the current situation and find the main contradiction. Everyone agreed that the nationwide technical innovation movement was an important measure to solve the problem of labor shortage and promote rural semi-mechanization and mechanization, and was of greater significance than other tasks at that time. At the same time, after the technical innovation movement was launched, it could be used as a guiding principle to promote the general with the specific, which would have a far-reaching impact on running a 10,000-pig farm, preparing for spring plowing, and achieving the 1960 leap forward targets. Therefore, it was decided to take this work as the center and carry out a nationwide movement to promote other work.

    However, technical revolution and technical innovation is a new topic, and many people dare not write articles on this topic. Some said: "Asking a roughneck to do fine work is like forcing a duck onto a shelf!" Some said: "Making innovations is the business of workers in farm tool repair and assembly plants, and has nothing to do with commune members." In order to break these superstitious ideas, I mobilized the masses ideologically from the perspective of understanding, and on the other hand, I took the lead in delving into the matter, determined to set an example for everyone. I "set the stage" on repairing the water tower. At that time, it was very difficult for commune members to get water. Canteens and pig farms often had to carry water from a ditch half a mile away, causing great pain to the commune members. The pig farm alone used eight laborers to carry water. How could we make it easier for everyone to get water? After thinking about it, the best thing to do was to build an earthen water tower, like in big cities, where you could turn on the faucet and get water. If this plan could be realized, it would not only solve the water problem, but also greatly promote technical revolution and technical innovation. With the support of the municipal party committee and the commune party committee, I and the craftsmen carefully discussed and studied, drew up designs, and thanks to the hard work of the broad masses of commune members day and night, an earthen water tower was built in less than ten days. A six-horsepower diesel engine pumped water in two stages into the 200-ton water tower, and then sent it to the canteen and pig farm through more than 1,000 meters of underground water pipes. This could save more than 20,000 workdays a year. The success of this innovation encouraged the masses, and a vigorous technical innovation movement was launched among the whole people. The vigorous development of technical innovation also drove the overall leap forward of various tasks. For example, the mechanization of pig raising drove the development of pig raising, and the innovation of fertilizer application vehicles drove the winter topdressing of wheat.

    See the Object and See the Person -- Care for the Masses' Lives

    "When the Party leads the work of the commune, it must pay attention to grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life in an all-round way. It must care for people and correct the tendency to see the object but not the person. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care for the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares for the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." I keep these words instructed by the Party Central Committee firmly in my mind. During the summer harvest last year, I went deep into the teams, visited the commune members, and found that there were some problems in their lives. According to this situation, on the one hand, I educated everyone to "seize grain from the tiger's mouth" and work hard, and on the other hand, I extracted fifteen Party and League members and activists to help the canteen do a good job in providing meals. The variety of food increased, the taste improved, and everyone was able to eat hot meals and eat their fill. Everyone's enthusiasm increased, and they increased from harvesting one mu per day to two mu, completing the summer harvest task four days ahead of schedule. Usually, I constantly visit the commune members' homes to ask about their illnesses and difficulties, and ask about their eating, clothing, childbirth, and medical treatment problems. Those that can be solved immediately are solved immediately. The commune members were very moved. Yang Shengfu's mother, who was more than seventy years old, chased after the captain to ask for work after her difficulties in life were resolved.

    The Party branch should care for the lives of the masses as much as it cares for production, and put the masses' living problems on the agenda. I often put some common problems to the Party general branch committee for careful study and resolution. In particular, we have studied the issue of improving public canteens many times. Recently, I went to the canteen for a few days, ate with everyone, and found that there were still many problems. All of them were brought to the general branch meeting for study, and finally it was decided to stop running the cadre canteen. All the general branch committee members and management committee members of the management area went to each team to participate in the meals of each team and help solve the problems. After the cadres went to the canteens of each team, the problem of one hall with multiple stoves in each team and the problem of the dining hall in the fifth team were quickly solved. The canteens improved day by day, boosting the greater enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and promoting production.

    我当支部书记的几点体会
    中共山西侯马市曲村公社杨谈管理区总支书记　王德合
    我是一个普普通通的党的支部书记，过去是个大老粗，斗大的字识不了几筐，一没文化、二没能耐。解放后，由于党的培养教育，先后担任了行政村长，互助组长，农业社长，公社成立以后，才当了九村六百八十六户的杨谈管理区党总支书记。这些年来，论工作，倒是起早搭黑、尽力地干哩；要说谈经验，恐怕说不成个什么样子。只能把十多年来工作上一些体会向大家介绍一下。
    一把钥匙开千锁
    ——钻政策学理论
    如果说我的工作还有点成绩，或者说我还能为党做些工作的话，那全靠党的培养。我自己只不过是听党和毛主席的话，学习，学习，再学习。
    几年来，我抱着不耻下问的态度，拜村里有点文化的人为师，做他们的学生，时时刻刻，学习钻研，因此，我不仅由半文盲而达到高小毕业程度，而且，随着文化水平的提高，更注意了学习党的政策和理论。对每个时期党的重要文件、方针、政策和毛主席的许多文章，我都仔细阅读。尤其是毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，中共中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”等，都熟读多遍。还经常阅读“红旗”、“前进”、“人民日报”、“山西日报”、“山西农民报”、“侯马报”、“好党员”、“支部生活”、“农业知识”等十多种报刊。
    学习，一定要有恒心。不仅闲下来要学，忙时也要学，越忙越要学。人常说“磨刀不误砍柴工”。任务紧了，不学透政策，就会出偏差，走弯路。只有学好党的文件，才能思想明确，掌稳舵，猛冲锋，百战百胜。我深深体会了这一点。因此，每天总要坚持一至两小时的学习，种试验田的时候，和干部们一块学，下队劳动时，和社员们一块学，深夜开完会以后，爬在灯下也学一会，七拼八凑，聚零为整，时间也不算少。有些人也曾经这样说过：“德合呀，咱一个下面的干部，一不订政策，二不制方针，党说干啥咱干啥就行，再学还想成龙变虎吗？”不，只有学习好，才能工作好，尤其是一个党支部书记，只有学习好才能更好地掌握党的政策，创造性地工作。比如：去年我在学习理论中明确了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的道理，具体运用在发展养猪工作中。在制定规划的时候，我想，要一口吃个热蒸馍，想在几天内发展一万头猪是不可能的，但建万头猪场是必要的，客观上又是可能的。于是，我提议把长远规划和分期完成结合起来。大家同意用这个精神订了规划，在一个能容纳万头猪的地方，建立了猪场，猪场按照规划迅速发展，从去年4月到现在，猪圈由原有一百四十个扩建到七百五十个。
    大家来合计出个好主意
    ——发挥集体领导作用
    民间有句俗话：“一人不如二人计，三人出个好主意。”这句话讲出了一个真理：一人之计有限，集体智慧无穷。我们当支部书记的绝不能包办代替，要发挥大家的智慧，加强党的集体领导。我们坚持总支委员会一月开三次，党员大会一月开一次。每件重大工作，都先在党内讨论，共同研究、共同决定、共同负责、共同贯彻执行。公社化以后，有的干部说：
  “书记挂了帅，委员好轻快，你说咋办，咱咋办。”我及时在干部中指出了这个错误，说明：坚持集体领导永远是我们各级党委的领导方法，书记亦是集体领导中的一员，书记挂帅是在集体领导下挂帅。因此，我们始终坚持了这个领导方法，千斤重担大家来担，重大事情大家商量，比如公社化初期，有的干部说：“摊子大了，经济富裕了，还过穷光景吗？应当盖办公室、会议室。”有的说：“水涨船高。办公用具也得像个样子。”这分明是讲阔气、讲排场。但对这种论调我没有立即批驳，而把问题拿到会议上去讨论。大多数都认为要发扬艰苦奋斗的老传统，富日子要穷过。批判了社大、财多、多花钱的思想，坚持了勤俭办社的方针，把更多的资金用在扩大再生产上。二年来，我们用在行政管理费上所花的钱，占总收入的0.16％。
    下到海底才能捞得海珍
    ——深入群众依靠群众
    经常保持深入、细致的工作作风，是十分必要的。只要深入群众，才能依靠群众。如果整天呆在办公室里谈深入、细致，谈走群众路线，只会留在口头上，我觉得，要真正深入下去，必须把工作和劳动结合起来，接近群众才能团结群众，取得群众的信任。我每次在开完会，安排了工作以后，马上就扛上农具下地去了，有计划、有目的地到一个队参加劳动，和大家一块干活，一块吃饭，一块学习，常常就在田间开会，田间办公，坚持了能在田间处理的问题，不在村里处理。有人耽心参加了劳动就影响了工作，其实恰恰相反，深入下去，参加了生产，既能指导生产，也能作好其他工作。就连哪个队哪块地种得好坏，上肥多少，也都记得一清二楚。
    通过经常参加劳动，我和社员们都亲热了，不论大人、小孩都愿意和我谈谈。有事就找我商量。沟东的杨凯业、沟西的李雪温等有经验的老农和青年都是我的知心朋友，我一遇到什么事，就去找群众商量解决。去年11月，全区圈存猪三千六百多头，生猪发展速度快，饲料赶不上去，时值秋末冬初，百草枯黄，哪里找饲料呢？饲养员要我想办法，我找来干部研究，又和饲养员座谈，学习外地经验，让大家都想办法，献计献策，通过共同商量试验了用玉茭轴、棉花壳、玉茭秆、高粱秆等十多种加工后作猪饲料，这个办法很好。十六天工夫就储备了一百六十多万斤，足够吃半年多。
    从十多年的工作中使我深深体会到：“千计万计，群众路线第一计，千能万能，广大群众最能；离开群众，寸步难行，依靠群众，百战百胜。”只有事事走群众路线，事事同群众商量，才能更好地贯彻党的方针政策，更出色地完成各项工作任务。
    家有三件事先从紧处来
    ——抓主要矛盾
    一个管理区的工作是十分繁忙的，必须善于把它安排得有条不紊，使它繁而不杂，忙而不乱。这就要做到时时有中心，事事有重点。中心和重点是什么呢？我认为，要以搞好生产为主，分析分析这个时期最关紧要的工作是什么，也就是当前的主要矛盾是什么，这就是中心。以优势兵力集中进攻。其它工作也同时部署，分工负责，任务到人，交代方法，交代任务，交代要求，监督检查。但是，其他必须是围绕中心，服从于中心。对中心工作，就要亲自挂帅，一直抓到达到预期目的为止。
    去年冬天，当时的工作很多，万头猪场在继续兴建；党委号召开展全民性的技术革新运动；红专业余教育需要大搞；小麦管理也需要大抓。除此，共青团、妇联、民兵等各系统，还有许多工作要干。这么多工作，如果没有个中心，那就会一事无成，我就召开总支委员会，分析当前的情况，寻找主要矛盾。大家一致认为：全民性的技术革新运动是解决劳力紧张问题，促进农村半机械化、机械化的重要措施，在当时比其他几项工作有更重大的意义。同时，技术革新运动开展起来以后，便可以纲举目张，以重点带动一般，对办万头猪场、对春耕准备、对实现1960年跃进指标等有着深远意义。所以，决定就以此项工作为中心，开展全民运动，推动其他工作。
    但是，技术革命和技术革新，是一个新课题，许多人不敢在这个题目下面做文章，有的说：“叫大老粗做细活。是强打鸭子上架哩！”有的说：“闹革新是农具修配厂工人的事，与社员无关。”为了打破这些迷信观点，我一方面向群众作思想动员工作，从认识上解放思想；另一方面，又带头钻研，决心给大家做个样子看看。我把“戏”点在修水塔上。当时，社员吃水十分困难，食堂和猪场经常要到一里外的沟里担水，给社员造成很大痛苦，单养猪场担水就用了八个劳力。怎样让大家吃水方便呢？思来想去，最好能建筑一座土水塔，像大城市一样，拧一下龙头就可以吃到水，这个计划如果能实现，不仅解决了吃水问题，将会对技术革命、技术革新有很大推动。在市委、公社党委的支持下，我和工匠们仔细讨论研究，绘图设计，由于广大社员的昼夜苦战，不到十天时间，建成了一座土水塔，用六马力的柴油机把水分两节抽进了容量二百吨的水塔内，再通过一千多米长的地下水管送到食堂和猪场。一年可节省两万多个工。这一革新的成功鼓舞了群众，一个蓬蓬勃勃的技术革新运动在全民中开展起来了。技术革新的蓬勃开展，也带动了各项工作的全面跃进。比如养猪机械化，带动了养猪的发展，施肥车的革新，带动了小麦冬季追肥。
    见物见人——关心群众生活
    “党在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向。群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众的生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”党中央指示的这些话，牢牢记在我的心里。去年夏收中，我就深入各队，访问了社员，发现在生活上存在一些问题，根据这个情况，一面教育大家“龙口夺食”，苦干实干，一面抽出十五个党团员积极分子帮助食堂搞好伙食，饭菜的花样也多了，味道也好了，能够吃热吃饱。大家越干劲头越大，由一天割一亩提高为二亩，提前四天完成夏收任务。在平常，我不断到社员家中访疾问苦，对他们的吃的问题，穿的问题，生孩子的问题，看病问题都要问一问，能马上解决的就马上给解决。社员很受感动。七十多岁的杨生富母亲，把她生活上的困难解决以后，追到队长后面要活干。
    党支部要像关心生产一样关心群众生活，把群众生活问题提到议事日程上来。我经常把一些带有普遍性的问题，提到党总支委员会上慎重研究解决。尤其是改进公共食堂问题，我们曾多次研究过。最近，我下食堂跑了几天，和大家一块吃了饭，发现仍存在许多问题，都提到总支会议上研究，最后决定停办干部食堂，管理区全体总支委员和管委分别下到各队，参加各队吃饭，帮助解决问题。干部下到各队食堂以后，各队的一堂多灶问题，五队的饭厅问题等都很快解决了。食堂的一天天改进，鼓起了广大社员的更大干劲，促进了生产。
