Xinhua News Agency, 29th, Tokyo dispatch:  The conspiracy of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who has been forced to announce his resignation, to secretly organize a second reactionary "Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet" is being strongly attacked even within the ruling party.

According to Kyodo News, the Liberal Democratic Party's Matsumura-Miki faction, Kono faction, Ishibashi faction, and centrist factions held a meeting on the 28th to discuss their attitude towards the next prime minister issue. They reached an agreement: (1) Oppose the private consultation on the candidate for the next prime minister at the eight-person meeting of the government and ruling party leaders; (2) Oppose nominating someone who would give the public the impression of practicing money politics and power-seeking as a candidate for the next prime minister. These three anti-mainstream and centrist factions within the Japanese ruling party also agreed that if the Kishi Nobusuke and other mainstream factions forcibly "rectify the party" to exclude them, then "the anti-mainstream factions must unite to confront it."

Kyodo News said: This decision is a "tough counterattack" against the mainstream faction's practice of negotiating the next prime minister completely disregarding the anti-mainstream factions. Since being forced to announce his resignation on the 23rd under the blows of the people's struggle, Kishi Nobusuke has not only failed to resign quickly, but has also illegally planned to establish a new reactionary cabinet to inherit his traitorous policies and maintain the power and influence of his faction in the new cabinet. Kishi Nobusuke and his confidants have been frequently holding talks with the heads of other factions in recent days, secretly discussing the candidates for the next prime minister. However, the heads of some powerful factions within the Japanese ruling party are all vying to be the next prime minister and president of the ruling party, and they refuse to give in to each other, leading to constant disputes.

Taking advantage of this situation, Kishi Nobusuke played a new trick. He convened a meeting of the government and ruling party leaders on the 27th and decided that the prime minister should be determined first, and then the president of the ruling party, in order to extend his term as president and maintain control over the ruling party. According to the decision of the Kishi Nobusuke group, the new prime minister should be determined before July 15, and the president of the ruling party should be elected after July 15.

The Kishi Nobusuke group also held a so-called ruling party "eight-person meeting" on the 28th to discuss the candidates for the next president. Japanese Radio said: The members attending the "eight-person meeting" were all "people from factions that support the Kishi Cabinet, and not a single person who adopted a critical attitude towards the Kishi regime participated." However, according to reports, this meeting still failed to reach a complete agreement.

When revealing the truth about the long delay in deciding on the next Japanese prime minister, Japan Broadcasting Corporation Radio pointed out: "It is not that a successor cannot be decided, but that it is not easy to decide for (Kishi Nobusuke)'s own convenience." It said: Kishi Nobusuke’s "resignation will decide it."

    日本执政党反主流派和中间派集会
    反对岸信介私相授受政权
    岸信介阴谋在新内阁中保持自己的派系势力
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：已经被迫宣布要下台的日本首相岸信介私下进行的组织第二个反动的“岸信介内阁”的阴谋活动，在执政党内部也受到强烈的攻击。
    据共同社报道，自由民主党的松村—三木派、河野派、石桥派和中间派28日举行会议，讨论了对下届首相问题的态度。他们达成协议：（一）反对在政府和执政党首脑的八人会议上私下商定下任首相的候选人；（二）反对提名那种会给国民以实行金权政治、权利主义的印象的人做下任首相候选人。日本执政党内的这三个反主流派和中间派还商定，如果岸信介等主流派要强行“整党”来排斥他们，那么“反主流派就要团结起来同它对抗”。
    共同社说：这个决定是对于主流派完全不顾反主流各派而协商下任首相的做法的一个“强硬的反击”。岸信介自从在人民斗争的打击下于23日被迫宣布要下台以后，不但不迅速辞职，而且还非法地策划成立新的反动内阁，来继承他的卖国政策，并在新内阁中保持他的派系的势力和影响。岸信介和他的亲信最近几天频繁地同其他派系的首脑举行会谈，秘密磋商下任首相的人选。但是，日本执政党内一些势力较大的派系的首脑都争着要当下届首相和执政党总裁，彼此互不相让，争执不下。
    利用这种情况，岸信介又玩弄了一个新的诡计。他在27日召开政府和执政党首脑会议，竟然决定要先确定首相，后决定执政党总裁，以便延长他担任总裁的时间，保持对执政党的控制。按照岸信介集团的决定，新首相要在7月15日以前确定，而执政党总裁要在7月15日以后再选举。
    岸信介集团还在28日举行所谓执政党“八人会谈”，讨论下任总裁人选问题。日本电台说：出席“八人会谈”的成员都是“支持岸内阁的派系的人，而对岸政权采取批判态度的人一个也没有参加”。但是，据报道，这次会议仍然没有完全达成协议。
    日本广播协会电台揭露日本下任首相迟迟未决的真相时指出：“并不是不能决定继任人，而是（岸信介）为了自己的方便才不容易决定下来”。它说：岸信介“辞职了就会决定下来”。
