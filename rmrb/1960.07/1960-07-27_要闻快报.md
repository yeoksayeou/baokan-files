　　Dazi Implements the "Three-Seven System"
　　The Dazi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet has decided, based on the actual conditions of the county, to change the "two-five system" to a "three-seven system." County and district-level cadres will spend three days learning, meeting, and researching work, and seven days participating in production and leading production. The County Committee specifically stipulates: During the seven days that county and district leaders participate in production, they will spend four days at a fixed point, two days on circuit inspections, and one day summarizing; general cadres will spend three days at a fixed point, three days on circuit inspections, and one day summarizing. The County Committee requires that in each day, the method of "observing in the morning, working at noon, and helping in the evening" should be used to carry out the work.
　　Participating in Production and Protecting Production
　　The broad masses of judicial cadres in Liaoning Province are earnestly implementing the working method of "participating in production to protect production, going to the masses, and relying on the masses," and are actively leaving their offices and going deep into the front lines of industrial and agricultural production.
　　Judicial cadres live, eat, work, and consult with the broad masses of workers and peasants, making the combination of judicial work and productive labor regularized and systematized, and powerfully safeguarding the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics, from January to May of this year alone, leading judicial cadres at all levels and all trial personnel directly participated in central work 1,685 times.
　　Apprentices Become Scientific Research Cadres
　　The various research institutes under the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have recently promoted a large number of research and technical cadres, among whom hundreds of outstanding young apprentices and young probationers have been promoted to technicians and research interns.
　　Many of the newly promoted cadres originally had a low level of education, but after arduous study, they have not only mastered complex operating techniques, but have also made achievements in research work.
　　Childcare Organizations Form Networks and Systems
　　The work of kindergartens and nurseries in urban and rural areas of Shanxi Province has gradually developed towards the direction of forming networks, complete sets, and a "one-stop" system. At present, the number of children enrolled in kindergartens and nurseries in rural areas throughout the province accounts for more than 80% of the total number of children; in urban areas, it has reached more than 50%.
　　The characteristics of these childcare organizations are: maternity hospitals, lactation rooms, nurseries, and kindergartens are linked into a unified whole, so that children can receive uninterrupted social education from birth to before school.
　　Large-Scale Inspection of Archives Work
　　In order to further implement the central government's instructions on the unified management of Party and government archives work and to better serve socialist construction, the General Office of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee, and the Provincial Archives Bureau jointly organized a large-scale inspection of archives work throughout the province in mid-to-late June. All members of the inspection team visited Shishou County in early July for on-site visits, exchanged experiences, and made a summary.
