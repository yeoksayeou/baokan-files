Xinhua News Agency, London, July 9th. Thousands of people attended the funeral of Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party, at the Golders Green Crematorium in northwest London today. Among them were William Gallacher, Honorary Chairman of the British Communist Party, General Secretary John Gollan, and representatives from many Communist Parties, including those of the Soviet Union, China, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Cyprus, and Northern Ireland. Zhao Yimin, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the funeral on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.

    At the crematorium, people paid their last respects to Comrade Pollitt. Speaking at the funeral ceremony were William Gallacher, John Gollan, a representative of the Boiler Makers Union, to which Pollitt belonged, Sheel, Soviet Communist Party representative Pospelov, and French Communist Party representative Garaudy. Tributes from Communist Parties of other countries were handed over to the British Communist Party. Renowned black singer Paul Robeson sang the famous song "Joe Hill," praising the leaders of the workers' movement, at the ceremony.

    John Gollan, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, said that Pollitt's life was an immortal record of service to the British working class. We can never forget his contributions to building the trade union movement, raising wages and reducing working hours, helping the unemployed, assisting the Spanish Republic, and defeating Hitler fascism. He believed that his main task was to raise the working class's awareness of seizing power and establishing socialism so that the working people could control the destiny of Britain.

    Gollan said, "As we lower our flag to pay our sorrowful last respects, we are also commemorating his victorious life of service to the working class and communism. This is not the end. A new generation is proudly inheriting his position." "His cause is advancing, making people proud all over the world, and achieving victory." He concluded by saying that British Communists pledge to live and fight like Pollitt to build the Communist Party and to ensure the victory of the great socialist cause.

    Pospelov said in his speech that Comrade Pollitt was an outstanding leader of the British and international labor movements, a tireless fighter for peace, democracy, and socialism, and an ardent internationalist. His death is a great loss not only to Britain but also to the entire international labor movement. He said that from his youth until the last moment of his life, Comrade Pollitt was always at the center of the class struggle, consistently defending the interests of the working people and opposing British imperialism and international imperialism. Pospelov also emphasized that Pollitt had always been the most loyal and sincere friend of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. He always believed in the final victory of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine that brings happiness and a peaceful future to all peoples. Pospelov bid farewell to Pollitt, saying, farewell, our dear friend and comrade, the communist cause for which your glorious life fought will be victorious.

    The funeral ceremony ended with the singing of The Internationale.
