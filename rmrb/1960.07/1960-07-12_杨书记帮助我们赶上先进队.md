Secretary Yang Helps Us Catch Up with Advanced Teams

Our Shaluo Production Brigade in the Daoyao Commune has eight production teams. Since this spring, our Shichong Production Team has consistently lagged behind in every production competition. To help us catch up with the advanced teams, Yang Hongdian, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, came to our team in late May to participate in and lead production. When planting summer sweet potatoes, the sixth work group of nine people only managed to dig 1.3 mu of land per day, and the quality was poor, only digging to a depth of five inches. Secretary Yang then convened a forum with experienced farmers and proposed using oxen to plow the land. Veteran farmer Liu Weiming said: "The soil is too hard when plowed by oxen, and the sweet potatoes won't grow well." Secretary Yang thought this made sense, and he considered: "If a few iron harrow teeth were installed under the plow, it would definitely loosen the soil." The next day, the experiment was successful. In half a day, one person plowed 1.6 mu of land, with a depth of seven inches. After the whole team adopted this method, the summer sweet potatoes were planted by June 20th. On June 26th, the entire brigade conducted another production inspection and competition, and our Shichong Production Team was named the champion.

　　杨书记帮助我们赶上先进队
    我们大瑶公社沙螺生产大队共有八个生产小队，今春以来，每次生产评比，我们石冲生产小队总是落在后边。为了帮助我们赶上先进队，大队党总支书记杨宏典在5月下旬来到我们队里，参加生产，领导生产。在栽种夏薯的时候，第六作业组九个人一天只挖地一点三亩，质量也不好，只能挖到五寸深。杨书记就召开老农座谈会，并提出用牛犁地的办法。老农刘为名说：用牛犁土地板硬，薯长不好。杨书记认为这话有道理，他想：如果在犁下装几个铁耙齿，一定能松土。第二天一试验，果然成功了。半天时间一人犁地一点六亩，深耕七寸。全队推行了这个办法以后，到6月20日，就把夏薯栽种完了。6月26日全大队又进行了生产检查评比，我们石冲生产队被评为冠军。
