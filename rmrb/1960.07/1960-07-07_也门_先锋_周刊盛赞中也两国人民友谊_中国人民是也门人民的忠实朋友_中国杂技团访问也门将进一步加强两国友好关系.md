Xinhua News Agency, Taiz, July 5th: A recent issue of Yemen's "Pioneer" weekly published an article entitled "The Friendship Between China and Yemen is Flourishing," enthusiastically praising the increasingly strengthened friendly relations between the peoples of China and Yemen.

The article stated that the Chinese people's historic victory over evil and traitorous forces enabled them to restore and develop all the good things in their lives. The warm welcome the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe received during its performances in Sana'a, Taiz, Hodeidah, and other places was filled with the Yemeni people's "most sublime feelings of admiration" for the Chinese people. The article emphasized that the visit of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe would further strengthen the spirit of friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China.

After reviewing the growing friendly relations between the peoples of China and Yemen in recent years, the article stated that the Chinese people, understanding the Yemeni people's great will for rapid progress and development, came to Yemen from the far end of Asia to help build the Hodeidah-Sana'a highway, which is now nearing completion. This is why the Chinese people are considered "closest to our people's hearts" and why they receive our ever-growing deepest feelings and love.

The article also stated that the Yemeni people believe the Hodeidah-Sana'a highway is a new miracle created by the socialist East in the Arab East; this is another new "Long March" jointly undertaken by the Yemeni people and the people of the "Great Long March."

The article continued that, following the Hodeidah-Sana'a highway, Chinese experts would also help implement a textile mill construction project. The article stated that the seventy-five Yemeni students currently receiving training in China would return to Yemen when the highway and the textile mill are completed, to take responsibility for managing the textile mill and maintaining the highway.

The article pointed out that when the Chinese experts complete their tasks and return home, the friendship between China and Yemen will not end but will be increasingly strengthened and will be embodied in those projects.

The article emphasized that, in contrast to the aid provided by the imperialist countries headed by the United States, the aid provided by socialist countries is "without conditions and without ulterior motives." The article said, "The Chinese people are firm supporters and loyal friends of the Yemeni people."

Xinhua News Agency, Sana'a: Sana'a Mayor Prince Ali held a grand banquet at the Royal Palace on June 27th on behalf of Yemeni Crown Prince Badr to entertain the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe.

All members of the acrobatic troupe, Shi Sheng, Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Yemen, and Wang Jinqian, leader of the Chinese highway expert team, were invited to attend the banquet. Prince Ali and Wu Kunshan, head of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, spoke at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly and cordial atmosphere.

Prince Ali said that this cordial atmosphere reminded him of what Crown Prince Badr said after visiting China: "I only found friends in the East." (Attached picture)

    也门“先锋”周刊盛赞中也两国人民友谊
    中国人民是也门人民的忠实朋友
    中国杂技团访问也门将进一步加强两国友好关系
    新华社塔兹5日电　最近一期的也门“先锋”周刊就中国杂技团正在也门进行的访问刊载了一篇题为“中国和也门的友谊发扬光大”的文章，热情赞扬中国和也门两国人民日益加强的友好关系。
    文章说，中国人民对罪恶和卖国势力所取得的历史性胜利使得他们恢复和发展了他们生活中一切美好的东西。中国杂技团这次在萨那、塔兹、荷台达等地方演出时获得的热烈欢迎，充满了也门人民对中国人民的“最崇高的爱慕的感情”。文章强调指出，中国杂技团的访问将进一步加强也门和中国人民之间的友好精神。
    这篇文章在回顾了几年来中也两国人民日益增长的友好关系之后说，了解也门人民具有迅速进步和发展的伟大意志的中国人民，从亚洲遥远的那一端前来也门帮助修建荷台达—萨那公路，这条公路现在接近完成；这就是为什么中国人民会被认为是“最接近我们人民的心”，为什么获得我们越来越增长的最深切的感情和爱戴的原因。
    文章又说，我们也门人民认为，荷台达—萨那公路是社会主义东方在阿拉伯东方创造的一个新的奇迹；这是我们也门人民和“伟大的长征”的人民共同进行的另一次新的“长征”。
    这篇文章继续说，继荷台达—萨那公路之后，中国专家还将帮助执行一项纺织厂的建设计划。文章说，现在在中国接受训练的七十五名也门学生在这条公路和这家纺织厂完成的时候将回到也门来，负起管理纺织厂和保养公路的责任。
    文章指出，当中国专家完成他们的任务回国时，中国和也门的友谊将不会终止，而是将越来越加强，并且将化身体现在那些工程中。
    文章强调指出，同以美国为首的帝国主义国家提供的援助相反，社会主义国家提供的援助是“没有条件和没有企图的”。文章说，“中国人民是也门人民坚定的支持者和忠实的朋友。”
    新华社萨那电　萨那市长阿里亲王6月27日代表也门王太子巴德尔在王宫举行盛大宴会招待中国杂技团。
    杂技团的全体成员、中国驻也门公使馆商务参赞石生、中国公路专家小组组长王进前应邀出席了宴会。阿里亲王和中国杂技团团长伍坤山在充满友好和亲切气氛的宴会上讲了话。
    阿里亲王说，这种亲切的气氛使他回想起王太子巴德尔在访问中国之后说的话：“我只是在东方找到了朋友”。（附图片）
