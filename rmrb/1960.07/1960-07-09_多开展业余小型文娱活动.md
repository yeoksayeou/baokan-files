    Promote More Amateur Small-Scale Cultural and Recreational Activities
    On the evening of June 28th, our office showed a movie, and the General Affairs Department took advantage of the time before the screening to put on many small performances for everyone, including chorus, male and female solo singing, instrumental ensemble, poetry recitation, Peking Opera, Ping Opera, ventriloquism, and double act; the performers were also very diverse, including cooks, drivers, nurses, general affairs staff, receptionists, and office cadres. This rich and colorful amateur small-scale performance was warmly welcomed by the masses time and time again. Several programs were performed several times, and some comrades who had never been on stage before sang very well, reflecting the broad artistic talents of the masses under the leadership of the Party. Judging from this activity, this kind of amateur small-scale performance is a form of enlivening the cultural life of organs that is worth promoting. The content of the programs is not limited, and the performances are held during short intervals, making preparation relatively convenient and can be done during spare time. You can also create and perform your own programs. Timely cooperation with the current central work can be used for propaganda on current affairs and policies, reflecting new people and new things. It not only enlivens the lives of the masses, but also cultivates the masses' artistic activity ability, and strengthens propaganda and mobilization work, playing a good role in combining work and rest.
    I think that not only in organs, schools, and cities can this be promoted, but also in factories, mines, rural areas, and communes.

    多开展业余小型文娱活动
    6月28日晚上，我们机关放映电影，总务处利用放映前时间给大家演出了很多小节目，有合唱、男女声独唱、乐器合奏、诗歌朗诵、京剧、评剧、口技、双簧等；参加演出的人员也很广泛，炊事员、司机、护士、公务勤杂工作人员、招待员、机关干部都有。这次丰富多彩的业余小型演出，受到群众一次又一次的热烈欢迎，好几个节目连演几遍，一些从未登过台的同志却演唱得很好，体现出在党的领导下广泛的群众的艺术才能。从这次活动来看，这种业余小型演出是值得提倡的活跃机关文化生活的一种形式。节目内容既没有什么限制，又是利用短短的间隙时间演出，准备也比较方便，可利用业余时间进行。还可以自编自演。及时配合当前中心工作进行时事政策等方面的宣传，反映新人新事。既活跃了群众的生活，也培养了群众艺术活动能力，又加强了宣传鼓动工作，在劳逸结合方面也起到良好的作用。
    我觉得不仅在机关、学校、城市可以推广，在工矿、农村、公社也都可以这样做。
