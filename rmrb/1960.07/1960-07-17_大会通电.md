Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The telegram from people of all circles in the capital supporting the Cuban people's opposition to U.S. imperialist intervention is as follows:

　　The "Congress of People from All Circles in the Capital of China Supporting the Cuban People's Opposition to U.S. Imperialist Intervention and Welcoming the Delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation," jointly initiated by the China-Latin America Friendship Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was grandly held in Beijing today.

　　China's 650 million people resolutely support the Cuban people's just struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. imperialist intervention. The Chinese people have always regarded the Cuban people's just struggle as their own and every victory of the Cuban people as their own. Furthermore, it is believed that the Cuban people's just struggle is also a tremendous support for the people of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the world in their struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

　　The Chinese people strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' consistent interference in Cuba's internal affairs and serious crimes of undermining the Cuban revolution. Recently, U.S. imperialism has been stepping up its brutal intervention against the Cuban people who are safeguarding national independence, actively plotting new military adventures, and妄想 (wangxiang- vainly attempt) to strangle the Cuban people's revolution and prevent the vigorous development of the national democratic movement in Latin America. This further proves that the war of aggression essence of U.S. imperialism will not change, thus arousing even greater indignation among the Cuban and Latin American people, and peace-loving people all over the world, making them even more united to wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

　　The current world situation is increasingly favorable to the cause of people of all countries in defending world peace, striving for national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism. The storm of the world's people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has risen and is constantly expanding. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the national democratic forces in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the strength of the people's struggle in Western countries, and all peace-loving forces in the world are constantly developing and growing. U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated in the face of the people of the world, and its lifespan will not be too long. As long as the people of all countries further unite and carry out unremitting struggle, they will surely be able to defeat the imperialist policies of war and aggression headed by U.S. imperialism, and achieve the final victory in the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress.

　　Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist intervention in Cuba!

　　Resolutely support the Cuban people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist intervention!

　　Long live the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Cuban people!

　　May the friendship between the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America last forever!

　　Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　大会通电
    新华社16日讯　首都各界人民支援古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉的通电，全文如下：
    由中国拉丁美洲友好协会和中华全国总工会共同发起的中国“首都各界人民支援古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉及欢迎古巴工人联合会代表团大会”今天在北京隆重举行。
    中国六亿五千万人民坚决支持古巴人民的维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义干涉的正义斗争。中国人民一向把古巴人民的正义斗争看做自己的斗争，把古巴人民的每一胜利看做自己的胜利。并且认为，古巴人民的正义斗争，也是对拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲和全世界人民反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义斗争的巨大的支持。
    中国人民严厉谴责美帝国主义一贯干涉古巴内政、破坏古巴革命的严重罪行。最近美帝国主义正在加紧对维护民族独立的古巴人民进行横暴的干涉，积极策划发动新的军事冒险，妄想扼杀古巴人民的革命和阻止拉丁美洲民族民主运动的蓬勃发展。这就更加证明了美帝国主义的战争侵略本质是不会改变的，从而更加激起古巴、拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的义愤，使他们更加团结起来，同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    目前的世界形势对于各国人民保卫世界和平、争取民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的事业越来越加有利。世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴已经兴起，并且在不断扩大。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量，拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲的民族民主力量，西方各国人民斗争的力量，全世界一切爱好和平的力量，正在不断发展和壮大。美帝国主义在全世界人民面前日益孤立，它的寿命不会太长了。只要各国人民进一步团结起来，进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够击败以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，使保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业取得最后的胜利。
    坚决反对美帝国主义干涉古巴！
    坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉的正义斗争！
    中古两国人民的友谊合作万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的友谊万古长青！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
              首都各界人民支援古巴人民反对美帝国主义
              干涉及欢迎古巴工人联合会代表团大会
                                1960年7月16日于北京
