　　People, Machines, and Technology Go to the Countryside Together
　　Xiao Bai
    In the current nationwide movement to support agriculture, many industries and units are doing everything possible to contribute to agricultural production. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed throughout the country have actively joined the movement to support agricultural production. Some troops go wherever the task is arduous, fully demonstrating the true qualities of the people's soldiers. Some troops bring machines and technology to the front lines of agricultural support, contributing labor, machines, and technology. This is a very effective form of support in the current situation. If the People's Liberation Army can do this, all other departments with the necessary conditions should also do so.
    Today, we must not only send labor and machines to the countryside, but also technology. Only by sending all of these together can we achieve greater results and more comprehensively support agricultural production. At present, the technical strength in rural areas is still relatively weak, and many members of agricultural machinery cooperatives have not yet fully mastered more complex technologies. Therefore, simply sending a large number of machines to the countryside is far from enough. In this situation, it is urgently necessary for workers, students, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have already mastered the technology to go to the countryside with the machines. After arriving in the countryside, on the one hand, they should first start up various machines to make them serve the current agricultural production; on the other hand, they should widely impart technology so that the vast number of farmers can quickly learn to master machine operation. We must teach them, not only teach farmers how to use the machines, but also teach them how to repair them. We must ensure that the people are there, the technology is there, and even when the people leave, the technology remains. Only in this way can we fully exploit the potential and role of agricultural machinery.
    Supporting agricultural production is a vigorous movement, but it must also be carried out with a down-to-earth spirit. Therefore, we must not only pay attention to how much manpower and machinery have been mobilized in this movement, but also pay attention to whether these manpower and machinery have played their role to the maximum extent in actual production. If this is done perfectly, then our support will become a powerful factor in improving agricultural production. If this is not done perfectly, it means that our support has not achieved the due effect in rural areas. For example, if the machines are sent to the countryside, but the technology is not sent along with them, and the machines are left idle, how can this produce any real effect? We must strive to avoid support that does not produce results like this. At present, the movement to support agricultural production is flourishing. In order to strive for a great harvest on the agricultural production front, we must continue to deepen the activities to support agriculture persistently and effectively, truly help farmers solve problems, and truly impart science and technology to farmers. Taking advantage of this favorable opportunity to help rural areas cultivate more technical strength will have a huge significance for accelerating agricultural technical transformation and improving agricultural production levels.

　　人、机器和技术一起下乡
　　萧柏
    在当前支援农业的全民性运动中，许多行业、许多单位都是千方百计，尽一切可能为农业生产贡献自己的力量。中国人民解放军驻全国各地部队，积极地投入了支援农业生产的运动。有的部队是哪里任务艰巨，就到哪里支援，这充分显示了人民子弟兵的本色。有的部队是把机器、技术一起带到支援农业的阵地上去，献劳力、献机器，又献技术，这在当前是十分有效的支援。解放军能够这样做，其它一切有条件的部门，也需要这样做。
    今天，我们不仅要劳力下乡，机器下乡，还要技术下乡。只有这样一齐下去，才会发挥更大的作用，更全面地支援农业生产。现在，农村的技术力量还比较薄弱，许多使用农业机械的社员还没有完全能够掌握比较复杂的技术。因此，光只是大批机器下了乡，还是远远不够的。在这种情况下，就迫切需要已经掌握了技术的工人、学生、解放军随着机器下乡。下乡以后，一方面先将各种机器开动起来，使它为当前的农业生产服务，另一方面，要广泛传授技术，使广大农民尽快地学会掌握机器操作。一定要教会他们，不仅教会农民用，还要教会农民修理。要做到人在技术在、人走技术还在。这样才能充分发挥农业机械的潜力和作用。
    支援农业生产，是一个轰轰烈烈的运动，同时也必须贯彻踏踏实实的精神。因此，我们不仅要注意在这个运动中出动了多少人力和机器，而且要注意这些人力和机器在实际生产中是否最大限度地发挥了它的作用。如果完满地做到了这一点，那么，我们的支援就成为提高农业生产的一个有力因素。如果没有完满地做到这一点，那就是说，我们的支援还没有使农村得到应有的实效。比如，机器下乡了，技术并没有随着下去，机器闲在那里，这怎么能产生实效呢？类似这样没有产生效果的支援，我们一定要努力避免。现在，支援农业生产运动正在蓬勃展开，为了争取农业生产战线上的大丰收，一定要把支援农业的活动持久有效地继续深入下去，切切实实帮助农民解决问题，切切实实把科学技术传授给农民。利用这个有利时机，帮助农村培养更多的技术力量，这对加速农业技术改造、提高农业生产水平都有巨大的意义。
