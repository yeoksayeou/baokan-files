Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, July 5th: West German Defense Minister Strauss and the U.S. Army Secretary held talks here today, plotting to equip West Germany's army with U.S. medium-range ballistic missiles through the U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The West German Ministry of Defense issued a statement after the meeting, saying that Strauss and Brooke had "no differences of opinion" on the issue of equipping the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces with medium-range missiles.

The statement recounted that U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates suggested at the last North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting that member states of the group be supplied with "Polaris" or other missiles with the same range. The statement emphasized that if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Command made such a suggestion to West Germany, West Germany would "seriously consider it."

The statement also said that Strauss and Brooke decided in the meeting to strengthen the cooperation between the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany and the West German "Bundeswehr."

While plotting to equip the West German army with missiles, the United States also decided to allocate $10.6 million to expand the military facilities of the U.S. forces stationed in West Germany. In addition, the United States will also provide 60.8 million marks for the military construction costs of U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe.

U.S. Army Secretary Brooke said at a press conference in Bonn on the 4th that West German Defense Minister Strauss expressed interest in the U.S. "Polaris" medium-range ballistic missiles, as well as smaller missiles such as "Honest John," "Corporal," "Hawk," "Nike," and "Pershing," during his recent visit to the United States.

Brooke said: "We (the United States) not only do not object to West Germany obtaining such weapons (Polaris missiles), but actively support this matter." He emphasized that the main "problem lies in building up (West Germany's) forces."

    美国策划用导弹武装西德
    布鲁克叫嚷加紧复活西德军国主义
    据新华社波恩5日电　西德国防部长施特劳斯和美国陆军部长今天在这里举行了会谈，策划通过美国控制的北大西洋侵略集团用美国中程弹道导弹装备西德的军队。
    西德国防部在会谈后发表声明说，施特劳斯和布鲁克在用中程导弹装备北大西洋集团部队的问题上，“没有意见分歧”。
    声明追述说，美国国防部长盖茨在上次北大西洋集团理事会会议上曾经建议用“北极星”式或其他具有同样射程的导弹供给这个集团的成员国。声明强调，如果北大西洋集团司令部向西德提出这样的建议，西德将要“加以认真的考虑”。
    声明还说，施特劳斯和布鲁克在会谈中决定要加强美国驻西德的部队同西德“国防军”的合作。
    美国在策划用导弹装备西德军队的同时，还决定拨出一千零六十万美元扩建驻西德美军的军事设施。另外，美国还将拿出六千零八十万马克作为驻西欧美军的军事建筑费用。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克4日在波恩举行的一次记者招待会上说，西德国防部长施特劳斯在不久前访问美国的时候，对美国的“北极星”式中程弹道导弹以及“诚实的约翰”、“下士”、“隼”、“奈克”和“潘兴”式等较小的导弹表示感到兴趣。
    布鲁克说：“我们（美国）不仅不反对西德得到这种武器（“北极星”式导弹），而且积极支持这件事。”他强调说，主要的“问题在于建立起（西德的）部队”。
