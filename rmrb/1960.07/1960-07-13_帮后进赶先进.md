    We are in the midst of a construction upsurge of catching up and leaping forward. In all aspects of socialist construction, advanced units and advanced things are constantly emerging, backward units and backward things are constantly advancing, and a sustained and comprehensive leap forward situation is formed where the backward catch up with the advanced and the advanced become even more advanced.
    The development of things is always unbalanced. In the entire advancing ranks, there will always be those who are relatively advanced and those who are relatively backward; those who progress faster and those who progress slower. This is the objective law of the development of things. The fundamental task of leaders is to use and create various favorable conditions to promote the transformation of the backward into the advanced, and to make the advanced even more advanced; to raise the backward production level to the advanced production level, and to raise the advanced level to the production level of the whole society, and then forward to an even higher level.
    The leadership method of "grasping the two ends and bringing along the middle" that the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us to adopt is a Marxist-Leninist leadership method suitable for the objective laws of development. Under the situation of a comprehensive leap forward, Party organizations in various places, on the one hand, cultivate typical examples, commend the advanced, and establish banners; on the other hand, help the backward, grasp the weak links, and catch up with the advanced in a big way. Since last year, the vigorous movement of helping the backward catch up with the advanced and the poor teams catch up with the rich teams in various places has been a large-scale movement to transform poverty and backwardness, and is the result of the successful application of this scientific leadership method. Thanks to the superiority of the people's communes of being "larger in size and having a higher degree of public ownership," this movement has achieved extremely great results, and the faces of many poor and backward production teams, management areas, and people's communes have been rapidly changed. According to incomplete statistics in January of this year, there were 3,510 poor teams in Anhui Province. In the past year, more than 550 have caught up with or surpassed the rich teams, more than 1,000 have caught up with or surpassed the general teams, and the production level of the remaining ones has also been greatly improved. In Gansu Province, 2,145 poor teams have jumped into the ranks of rich teams, accounting for about 71% of the total number of poor teams in the province's people's communes. In the Jinbei area, which has been known for its poverty, 12% of the 2,825 poor management areas in the region have caught up with or surpassed the rich areas, and 65% have caught up with or surpassed the general areas after a year of effort last year. These inspiring achievements are a great victory for our Party's creative leadership methods! At present, many places are carrying out a new movement of poor catching up with the rich on the basis of this victory. The Jinbei Prefectural Party Committee has put forward a new slogan: to catch up fundamentally, comprehensively, at high speed, and thoroughly change the face of poverty and backwardness. Cadres from all over the country have gone to the front line, especially to the backward areas, to grasp the weak links, and to carry out the mass movement of helping the backward and catching up with the advanced more deeply and extensively.
    We Marxists are dialectical materialists. We attach importance to the objective laws of the development of things, and at the same time attach importance to the subjective initiative of people and the ability of people to transform objective things. As long as we can recognize and master objective laws and make subjective efforts, the situation will change. Didn't Ping Shun County in Shanxi Province, with very bad natural conditions and a very backward production level, become an advanced county with a grain yield of over 400 jin per mu? Didn't the "Poor Stick Society" with only three donkey legs develop into an advanced and wealthy commune with a large number of agricultural machines? The fact that a large number of poor and backward production teams have jumped into the ranks of the advanced in the past year or so specifically illustrates a truth: in our thriving country, no matter how poor, backward, or unfavorable some areas are, as long as there is the strong leadership of the Party and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, no poverty and backwardness cannot be changed. "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change." The more poor and backward, the more urgent the masses' demand to change the status quo. We firmly believe that the masses in any backward area and backward unit will not be content to lag behind. On the contrary, their potential for progress is often greater. They want to struggle, they want to make revolution, and they want to advance to higher goals. Just like our entire country, because we are "poor and blank," the revolutionary enthusiasm of our people is particularly great. This kind of mass aspiration and demand is the huge driving force for the backward to become advanced!
    From the leadership's point of view, grasping the advanced, setting up pace-setters, and giving play to the inspiring and promoting role of model typical examples is an important aspect of the leadership method that cannot be ignored at all; and grasping the backward, grasping the weak links, encouraging and helping the backward units to catch up with the advanced units is also an important aspect that cannot be ignored at all. Moreover, the reason why backward areas and backward units lag behind is that, compared with advanced areas and advanced units, the situation is generally more complicated, the leadership is worse, the difficulties are greater, the problems are more numerous, and many conditions are more unfavorable. Precisely because of this, it is even more necessary to strengthen leadership and for leaders to go deep down. Of course, going to backward areas and backward units to work, going deep into poor areas and backward units, is generally more arduous and difficult than going to advanced areas and advanced units. But the backward part is also a part of our entire socialist motherland's big family. If the backward part cannot advance, and the weak links cannot be strengthened, our cause will not be able to achieve overall victory and comprehensive leap forward. Therefore, going to backward areas, going to the most difficult places, transforming backward teams and poor teams, letting the backward advance, and letting the poor teams catch up with the rich teams are the requirements put forward to us by the entire development of the situation. Under the influence of the new atmosphere of going up when encountering difficulties and helping when encountering backwardness, more and more outstanding Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres in various places are consciously and voluntarily going to the most difficult places, to backward areas, backward communes, backward teams, and poor teams, and to all backward departments and all weak links according to the needs of the revolution; they go deep down to closely link with the masses, and use their strong perseverance and full enthusiasm to help change the face of backward areas and backward units. The aforementioned poor teams catching up with the rich teams, and the backward jumping to the advanced, are inseparable from the hard work of these comrades. The exemplary actions of these comrades have already had a profound impact on the broad masses. Like Comrade Ye Yang, who has been adhering to "four togethers" for ten years as reported many times in this newspaper, who goes deep into advanced areas and also goes deep into backward areas; like Comrade Shen Zhaoyun, the Party branch secretary of the Xiguan Production Team of the Datong Chengguan Commune in Qinghai who went deep and transformed the backward face as reported in this newspaper on June 13 and July 2; like Comrade Gao Yi, a cadre of the Yulin Prefectural Party Committee of Shaanxi who voluntarily applied to go to the backward areas as reported in this newspaper today; and many other model figures like them, their communist style of "going up when encountering difficulties and helping when encountering backwardness" has become a brilliant example for the broad masses of cadres.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us that Party cadres should enthusiastically strive to go to the most difficult areas and strive to do the most difficult work. The places where there are the most difficulties and the most problems are the places that most need people to work, to struggle, and to solve problems. The more difficult the place, the more we should go; the more arduous the work, the more we should do it. This is what makes a good comrade. Arduous work is like a burden, placed in front of us to see if we dare to bear it; the burden has light and heavy, and some people pick the light and fear the heavy, pushing the heavy burden to others and picking the light one for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Many comrades are not like this, they give the enjoyment to others, pick the heavy burden to carry, suffer before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades. We should all learn this communist spirit. Ye Yang, Shen Zhaoyun, and Gao Yi are such good comrades.
    The excellent qualities of these comrades are valuable not only because they do not care about personal gains and losses, do not avoid hardships and difficulties, and consciously and voluntarily shoulder the heavy responsibility of helping to transform the backward. What is even more valuable is their clear mass viewpoint of believing in the masses, mobilizing the masses, and relying on the masses, and a set of working styles of the mass line that goes deep into the masses. They understand that backward things are always formed due to many subjective and objective conditions, and to transform it, one must go deep into backward things, rely on local cadres and the broad masses, analyze the causes of backwardness, solve the main contradictions, and promote changes in its internal factors. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "Materialist dialectics holds that external causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes." Why are comrades such as Ye Yang, Shen Zhaoyun, and Gao Yi, listed above, so full of confidence in transforming the backward? It is because they deeply believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, they understand the aspirations and demands of the masses, and therefore, they are full of the spirit of revolutionary optimism, go to meet difficulties, and plunge into the most difficult struggles without fear. Comrade Ye Yang originally went deep into an advanced Wenshui Production Team and made very good achievements. Later, he resolutely went deep into a backward Changpo Production Team, lived in the homes of poor peasants, mobilized the masses, encouraged the working confidence of grassroots cadres, found advanced figures in the backward team, and launched a mass movement to learn from the advanced, changing the backward face of the Changpo Team. As soon as Comrade Shen Zhaoyun arrived in the backward team, he first helped the grassroots cadres to improve the work of the Party branch and strengthen the ideological education of Party members and the masses. Together with the broad masses of commune members, he solved the key problems of production. Once the core role of the Party branch was strengthened and the consciousness of the masses was generally improved, the situation of the backward team changed greatly in just a few months. Comrade Gao Yi, who voluntarily requested to go to the remote mountainous areas, appeared in the village completely as an ordinary laborer as soon as he arrived, took the lead in pushing large soil carts, and carried heavy work, solving production problems with the masses in labor, and quickly became a confidant of the masses; he took strengthening the ideological education of Party members and the masses as the central link in improving work, and paid attention to enlightening the consciousness of cadres and the masses, so after the enthusiasm of local cadres and the masses was mobilized, the backward team jumped to become an advanced team. We Communists transform the world, not by a few heroes and good men doing everything, but by relying on and mobilizing the masses to liberate themselves. Transforming the backward and transforming the poor teams cannot be done only by the charity of a few people or by taking everything into their own hands. This kind of mass revolutionary cause cannot be taken care of by a few people. Some cadres do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and think that the masses in backward areas are backward, so they are unwilling to go to backward areas. Some comrades, although they have gone to backward areas, will not be able to do a good job if they do not rely on the masses or follow the mass line.
    Leadership style and leadership methods are in the category of the superstructure. What methods and attitudes are used to treat the revolutionary cause of the masses is essentially also a question of ideology. Is it to go up when encountering difficulties, meet difficulties head-on, know the difficulties and advance, or fear difficulties, bypass difficulties, know the difficulties and retreat; is it to care for the masses with full enthusiasm, or to let them go and let them lag behind; is it to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, or to only believe in personal ability and rely on personal ability? These are two different ideological viewpoints and working styles, essentially reflecting two different worldviews and methodologies. The styles of the above-mentioned comrades Ye Yang, Shen Zhaoyun, and Gao Yi are a truly proletarian style, a noble quality of Communists who are "the first to worry about the world's worries." Fearing difficulties, seeking comfort, fearing the complexity of problems in backward areas, fearing the arduousness of work, fearing that going there will be strenuous and unrewarding, lacking both great ambitions and courage and enthusiasm, this is another kind of thought and style. This kind of thought is essentially a reflection of the worldview of lazy people and cowards. Of course, in this era of everyone striving to go upstream, in an era when "going up when encountering difficulties and helping when encountering backwardness" has become a social fashion, the market for this kind of thinking is getting smaller and smaller. Just as the development of the entire movement has advanced and backward, this backward corner in the field of ideological consciousness will gradually change under the influence of noble styles.
    Advanced areas and advanced units are the pioneers of our entire construction cause. We are full of excitement and joy, and hope that the advanced will become even more advanced. We are even more deeply concerned about the backward areas and backward units, and hope that the backward can catch up with the advanced. After solving the old contradictions, we must follow up to solve the new contradictions; after overcoming the old difficulties, we must continue to overcome the new difficulties; after transforming the old backward units, we must immediately go to help the new backward units; constantly revolutionizing and constantly advancing, our cause will achieve greater achievements in this continuous advancement. Our era needs thousands upon thousands of figures like Ye Yang, Shen Zhaoyun, and Gao Yi, and such figures are emerging in large numbers all over the country. Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, and the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, the broad masses of cadres in Guangdong, Qinghai, and Shaanxi are taking Ye Yang, Shen Zhaoyun, and Gao Yi as examples, and are applying to go to remote areas, to backward areas, to the most difficult places, and to the most arduous work posts! Many provinces have also launched movements to help the backward catch up with the advanced. This is an incomparably huge driving force for our great construction cause to continuously and comprehensively leap forward!

### 帮后进赶先进

    帮后进赶先进
    我们正处在一个你追我赶飞跃向前的建设热潮中，在社会主义建设事业的各个方面，先进单位和先进事物不断涌现出来，后进单位和后进事物不断前进，后进赶先进、先进更先进，形成一个持续的全面跃进的局面。
    事物的发展总是不平衡的，在整个前进的行列中，总会有比较先进的，有比较后进的；有进展较快的，有进展较慢的，这是事物发展的客观规律。领导者的根本任务，就是要运用和创造各种有利条件，促使后进的转化为先进，使先进的更加先进；使落后的生产水平提高到先进的生产水平，使先进的水平提高为全社会的生产水平，再向前提到更高的水平。
    党中央和毛泽东同志指示我们采用的“抓两头，带中间”的领导方法，就是适合客观发展规律的马克思列宁主义的领导方法。各地党组织在全面跃进的形势下，一方面培养典型，表扬先进，树立旗帜；另一方面帮助后进，抓紧薄弱环节，大赶先进。去年以来，各地蓬勃开展的帮后进赶先进、穷队赶富队运动，就是一个大规模地改造贫困和落后的运动，就是这种科学的领导方法成功运用的结果。由于人民公社发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，这个运动取得了极其伟大的成果，许多贫困落后的生产队、管理区和人民公社，面貌迅速为之改观。据今年1月份不完全的统计，安徽省原有三千五百一十个穷队，一年来已经有五百五十多个赶上或超过富队，有一千多个穷队赶上或超过一般队，其余的生产水平也有很大提高。甘肃省已经有二千一百四十五个穷队，跃进了富队的行列，约占全省人民公社穷队总数的71％。向称贫困的晋北地区，全区二千八百二十五个穷管理区，经过去年一年努力，已有12％赶上或超过富区，65％赶上或超过一般区。这些振奋人心的成就，是我们党的创造性的领导方法的伟大胜利！目前，不少地方正在这一胜利的基础上，开展了新的穷赶富运动。晋北地委已经提出新的口号：要从根本上赶，全面地赶，高速度地赶，彻底改变贫困落后的面貌。全国各地干部纷纷开赴第一线，特别是深入后进地区，抓紧薄弱环节，更深入更广泛开展帮后进、赶先进的群众运动。
    我们马克思主义者是辩证唯物主义者，我们重视事物发展的客观规律，同时也重视人的主观能动作用，重视人对客观事物的改造能力。只要我们能够认识和掌握客观规律，加以主观的努力，情况就会发生变化。自然条件很坏、生产水平很落后的山西平顺县，不是变成了粮食亩产超过四百斤的先进县份了吗？只有三条驴腿的“穷棒子社”，不是发展成了拥有大批农业机械的先进富裕的公社了吗？一年多来，大批穷困落后的生产队跃居先进行列的事实，具体地说明一个道理：在我们这个欣欣向荣的国家里，有些地区不论多么贫困，多么落后，条件多么不好，只要有党的坚强领导，有群众的革命干劲，没有什么贫困和落后的情况是不可改变的。“穷则思变”，越是贫困落后，群众改变现状的要求越是迫切。我们深信，任何后进地区和后进单位的群众，他们都不会是自甘落后的，相反，他们前进的潜力往往更大，他们要斗争要革命，要向更高的目标前进。正如我们整个国家一样，因为“一穷二白”，我国人民的革命干劲就特别大。这种群众的愿望和要求，就是后进变为先进的巨大动力！
    从领导的角度来说，抓先进，树标兵，发挥模范典型的鼓舞推动作用，这是领导方法的一个重要方面，是丝毫也不能忽视的；而抓后进、抓薄弱环节，鼓励和帮助后进单位赶上先进单位，也是一个重要的方面，也是丝毫不能忽视的。而且因为后进地区和后进单位之所以落在后面，就是因为比起先进地区和先进单位来，一般是情况比较复杂，领导比较差，困难比较大，问题比较多，很多条件也比较不利。正因为这样，这里就更加需要加强领导，更加需要领导人深入下去。当然，到后进地区和后进单位去工作，深入贫困地区和落后单位，一般地说来，比起到先进地区和先进单位，要艰苦得多，困难得多。但是后进部分，也是我们整个社会主义祖国大家庭中的一个部分，后进的部分如不能前进，薄弱的环节不能加强，我们的事业将不可能得到整体的胜利和全面的跃进。因此，到后进的地区去，到最困难的地方去，改造后进队和穷队，让后进的前进，让穷队赶上富队，这是整个形势发展向我们提出的要求。在见困难就上、见后进就帮的新风气影响下，各地有越来越多的优秀的共产党员和革命干部，自觉自愿的按照革命的需要，到最困难的地方去，到后进地区、后进公社、后进队和穷队里去，到一切落后部门去，到一切薄弱环节去；他们深入下去密切联系群众，用他们坚强的毅力和满腔的热情，去帮助改变后进地区和后进单位的面貌，上述的穷队赶上富队，后进跃为先进，和这些同志的艰苦努力是分不开的。这些同志的模范行动，已经在广大群众中产生了深远的影响。像本报多次报道过的、坚持“四同”十年如一日的、深入先进区也深入后进区的叶养同志；像六月十三日和七月二日本报报道过的、深入改造了后进面貌的青海大通城关公社西关生产队的党支部书记沈兆云同志；像今日本报报道的、自动申请到后进区去的中共陕西榆林地委干部高毅同志；还有许许多多这样的模范人物，他们这种“见困难就上，见后进就帮”的共产主义风格，成为广大干部的光辉的榜样。
    党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们，党的干部应该满腔热情地争着到最困难的地区、争着去作最困难的工作。那些地方最困难、问题最多，就是最需要人去工作，去斗争，去解决问题。越是困难的地方越要去，越是艰苦的工作越要作，这才是好同志。艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们面前，看我们敢不敢承担；担子有轻有重，有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给别人，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好态度。很多同志不是这样，享受让给别人，拣重的担子挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义的精神，我们都要学习。叶养、沈兆云和高毅等就是这样的好同志。
    这些同志的优良品质之所以可贵，还不仅仅在于他们不计较个人得失，不回避艰苦困难，自觉自愿地担负起帮助改造后进的重担。更可贵的，是他们相信群众、发动群众、依靠群众的鲜明的群众观点和一套深入群众的群众路线的工作作风，他们懂得，后进事物总是由于许多主客观条件形成的，要改造它，必须深入后进事物，依靠当地干部和广大群众，分析后进原因，解决主要矛盾，促使其内在因素发生变化。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中说过：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”像上面所列举的叶养、沈兆云和高毅等同志，为什么他们对改造后进这样充满信心呢？就是因为他们深信群众的智慧和力量，他们懂得群众的愿望和要求，因此，他们充满革命的乐观主义精神，迎着困难走去，投身到最困难的斗争中而无所畏惧。叶养同志原来深入一个先进的湿水生产队，作出了很好的成绩，以后他又毅然决然地深入到一个落后的长坡生产队，住在贫农家里，发动群众、鼓舞基层干部的工作信心，在落后队中找出先进人物，掀起了学先进的群众运动，改变了长坡队的落后面貌。沈兆云同志一到后进队，首先就帮助基层干部健全党的支部工作，加强对党员和群众思想教育工作，并同广大社员一起，解决生产关键问题，党支部的核心作用一经加强，群众觉悟普遍提高，短短几个月，后进队的局面就大为改观。自动要求到边远山区的高毅同志，一到村就完全以普通劳动者的姿态出现，带头推大土车，挑重活干，在劳动中和群众一起解决生产问题，很快就成为群众的知心朋友；他把加强对党员和群众的思想教育工作作为改进工作的中心环节，注重启发干部和群众的觉悟，所以在当地干部和群众积极性发动起来以后，后进队就一跃而为先进队。我们共产党人改造世界，不是少数英雄好汉来包打天下，而是依靠和发动群众自己解放自己。改造后进、改造穷队，也不能只凭少数人恩赐或是包办代替，这种群众革命的事业，少数人包也包不了的。有些干部不相信群众的智慧和力量，认为落后地区的群众落后，所以他们不愿到落后地区去。有些同志虽然到落后地区去了，如果不依靠群众、不走群众路线，工作也是做不好的。
    领导作风、领导方法问题是属于上层建筑的范畴。用什么方法什么态度来对待群众的革命事业，实质上也是意识形态方面的问题。是见困难就上，迎着困难，知难而进，还是惧怕困难，绕过困难，知难而退；是满腔热情关怀群众，还是听之任之让它落后下去；是相信群众依靠群众，还是只相信个人依靠个人能力？这是两种不同的思想观点和工作作风，实质上反映着两种不同的世界观和方法论，上述叶养、沈兆云和高毅等同志的风格是一种真正无产阶级的风格，是一种共产党人的“先天下之忧而忧”的高尚品质。怕困难，图安逸，怕后进地区问题复杂，工作艰苦，怕去了吃力不讨好，既无雄心大志，也缺乏勇气热情，这是另一种思想和风格。这种思想，实质上是懒汉和懦夫的世界观的反映。当然，在我们这个人人争上游的时代，在“见困难就上，见后进就帮”已成为社会风尚的时代，这种思想的市场越来越小。正如整个运动的发展有先进和后进一样，这种思想意识领域内的后进角落，在高尚风格的影响下，也会逐渐改变的。
    先进地区、先进单位是我们整个建设事业的先行者，我们满怀兴奋和喜悦，希望先进的更加先进。对后进地区、后进单位，我们更是深切关怀，希望后进能赶上先进。解决了旧的矛盾，还要跟着去解决新的矛盾；克服了旧的困难，还要继续去克服新的困难；改造了旧的后进单位，还要立即去帮助新的后进单位；不断革命，不断前进，我们的事业就是在这样不断前进中取得更大的成就。我们的时代需要千千万万叶养、沈兆云、高毅式的人物，而这样的人物也正在全国各地大量涌现。在广东省委、青海省委和陕西省委的领导下，广东、青海和陕西广大干部以叶养、沈兆云和高毅为榜样，纷纷申请到边远地区去，到后进地区去，到最困难的地方去，到最艰苦的工作岗位上去！很多省份也都开展了帮后进赶先进的运动，这是我们伟大的建设事业持续地全面地向前跃进的无比巨大的动力！
