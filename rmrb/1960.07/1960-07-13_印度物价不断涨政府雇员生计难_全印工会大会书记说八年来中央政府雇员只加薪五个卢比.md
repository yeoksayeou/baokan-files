Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 11th: The latest issue of the Indian "Commerce" weekly reported on the rising prices in India, stating that with the 1952-1953 prices as the base, the commodity price index rose by 7.6% from April 1959 to April of this year. Among them, the wholesale price index for textiles rose by 12.7%; sugar rose by 9.1%; rice by 4.9%; vegetables and fruits by 12.4%; edible oil by 10.1%; and meat, fish, and eggs by 10.3%.

According to the official "1959-1960 Economic Survey Report" published here in February, "Since the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, wholesale prices have risen by about 20%." The report said, "The cost of living index has also risen this year. The all-India index of consumer goods prices for the working class (with 1949 as the base - editor) rose from one hundred and nineteen at the end of 1958 to one hundred and twenty-four in December 1959. The food component of the index rose from one hundred and twenty-two to one hundred and twenty-eight. The average index for 1959 was one hundred and twenty-two, compared to one hundred and sixteen in 1958, an increase of 5.2%."

The All-India Trade Union Congress Secretary, Srivatsava, wrote in an article in the "New Century" weekly published on the 10th that, despite such huge increases in prices and the cost of living since 1952, central government employees have not received a raise except for the five rupees they received after a strike in mid-1957.
