Concentrate Forces to Guarantee Key Projects, Fight Annihilation Battles in Stages and Phases
Shuangyashan's Eight Pairs of New Mines Completed Ahead of Schedule
    (Our dispatch) Correspondent Wang Changshan reports: In mine construction, the Shuangyashan Construction Engineering Company adopted the method of fighting annihilation battles, concentrating manpower and materials to rush the construction of key mines, achieving rapid construction and rapid commissioning. Since 1959, under the premise of ensuring quality, eight pairs of mines have been completed ahead of schedule, and handed over to production an average of three months and ten days ahead of schedule.
    Shuangyashan is one of the high-quality coking coal bases in the north. Since 1958, the city has successively developed twenty-seven pairs of new mines. In the past, due to the large number of new mines starting construction, the battle line was stretched too long, and the use of manpower and materials was relatively scattered, which affected the speed of mine construction. In order to reverse this situation, in April of last year, in accordance with the Shuangyashan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions to "build quickly and put into production early," the company criticized the idea that the longer the battle line, the better, and the more new mines started, the better. It determined to shorten the battle line and concentrate forces to rush the construction of key mines. They classified and ranked the twenty-seven pairs of new mines that had already been developed according to the principle of "nation first, self-construction second, key projects first, general projects second," based on their importance and urgency. The four pairs of key mines in Baoshan District, which were invested by the state and could be completed quickly, were listed as the first batch of projects. The new mines that could not be completed in the short term or could not produce much raw coal even after completion, as well as the self-built new mines, were ranked in the second and third batches according to the specific situation, or temporarily postponed. This method of construction in batches, pair by pair, has effectively accelerated the construction speed of key mines. In the past year alone, the Sifangtai and Baoshan coal mines have been put into production.

    集中力量保证重点　分批分期打歼灭战
    双鸭山八对新井提前建成
    本报讯　通讯员王长山报道：双鸭山建设工程公司在矿井建设中，采取打歼灭战的办法，集中人力、物力，分批抢建重点矿井，做到了快建设、快投产。从1959年以来，在保证质量的前提下，已经提前建成了八对矿井，平均提前三个月零十天移交生产。
    双鸭山是北方优质焦煤基地之一。从1958年以来，这个市先后开拓了二十七对新矿井。过去由于新井开工多，战线拉得长，人力物力使用比较分散，影响了建井速度。为了扭转这种局面，去年4月，这个公司根据中共双鸭山市委“快建设，早投产”的指示，批判了战线越长越好，新井开工越多越好的思想，确定缩短战线，集中力量，抢建重点矿井。他们把已经开拓的二十七对新井，根据“先国家，后自建，先重点，后一般”的原则，按照轻重缓急分类排队。把宝山区四对国家投资又能很快建成的重点矿井列为第一批工程，把不能短期建成或建成后一时生产不出多少原煤以及自建的新矿井，按照具体情况排在第二批和第三批，或者暂时缓建。这样一批一批、一对一对地建设，有力地加快了重点矿井的建设速度。仅在去年一年内，就有四方台、宝山两大煤矿投入生产。
