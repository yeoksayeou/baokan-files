Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 26th. The American "Worker's Weekly" published on the 24th a statement issued last week by the National Executive Committee of the Communist Party USA, signed by Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, calling on the American people to resolutely oppose the US government's policy of aggression against Cuba.

The statement exposes the Eisenhower government's efforts to subvert and overthrow the Cuban revolutionary government, and its use of the so-called "Monroe Doctrine" to mask its attack on Cuba's sovereignty and independence. The statement calls on the American people to condemn and stop this policy, and to "fully support the heroic and resolute efforts of the Cuban people to crush the stranglehold of American corporations on their economy and lives." The statement calls on the American people to rise up and demand an end to the provocative policy of aggression against Cuba, the return of the American naval base in Cuba to Cuba, and a halt to the practice of strangling Cuba through oil, sugar, or other restrictions.

The statement concludes by saying that the American people should unite under the following slogans: "Hands off Cuba!" "Full support for the Cuban people's leader Castro's government in its struggle for freedom and a better life!"

    据新华社日内瓦26日电　美国“工人周报”24日登载了由美国共产党总书记葛斯·霍尔签名的美国共产党全国执行委员会在上星期发表的声明，号召美国人民坚决反对美国政府侵略古巴的政策。
    声明揭露艾森豪威尔政府竭力企图颠覆和推翻古巴革命政府，并利用所谓“门罗主义”来掩盖对古巴主权和独立的进攻。声明号召美国人民谴责和制止这种政策，“全力支持古巴人民为粉碎美国大公司对他们的经济和生活的窒息而进行的英勇和坚决的努力。”声明号召美国人民起来，要求结束侵略古巴的挑衅政策，把美国在古巴的海军基地归还古巴，制止通过石油、糖或其他限制来扼杀古巴的作法。
    声明最后说，美国人民应该在下列口号下集合起来：“不许干涉古巴！”“完全支持古巴人民领袖卡斯特罗的政府为争取自由和更美好的生活而进行的斗争！”
