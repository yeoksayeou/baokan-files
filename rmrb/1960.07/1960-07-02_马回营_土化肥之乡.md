Ma Huiying - Hometown of Native Fertilizer
The CCP Yichuan County Committee Correspondence Group

Ma Huiying Brigade of Songdian Commune in Yichuan County, Henan Province, is a well-known hometown of native fertilizer in the province. This year, the brigade's more than 3,000 mu of wheat grew well and yielded a large harvest. The commune members said: Such a good harvest is thanks to the native fertilizer!

The Ma Huiying Brigade began large-scale production of native fertilizer in the winter of 1958. The brigade branch selected Party members Liu Haoqian and production team leader Cheng Fengshe to specialize in native fertilizer. Initially, they knew nothing about fertilizer. However, encouraged by the Party branch, they persisted, collecting raw materials everywhere and carefully reading chemical reference books. In the process of boiling potassium nitrate, they failed twenty times before finally succeeding. After more than a year of efforts, by the end of 1959, they were able to manufacture 215 kinds of native fertilizer, 15 kinds of refined fertilizer, and 95 kinds of native pesticides. Several kinds of native fertilizers and native pesticides have been sent to Beijing for exhibition. Yichuan County has held four consecutive native fertilizer training classes in the Ma Huiying Brigade, training 750 native fertilizer technicians. This brigade also supplied 2,900 copies of materials to other provinces and counties. This spring, the native fertilizer plant here successfully experimented with extracting ammonia from flue gas and has begun producing high-quality fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and potassium chloride.

This year, the entire brigade's wheat was applied with a large amount of native fertilizer. When the wheat turned green, all wheat fields were applied with 400 jin of native fertilizer per mu. For late-sown and weak wheat fields, an additional 600 jin of native fertilizer was applied per mu. In March, 20 jin of potassium nitrate was universally applied per mu of wheat field. In April, another 15 jin of ammonium sulfate was applied per mu. In addition, from last winter until the wheat matured, all wheat fields were sprayed with self-made sulfur mixture. This year, the wheat grew more than four feet tall, but did not lodge; the weather was not normal, but there were no serious diseases.

The experience of the Ma Huiying Brigade has been quickly promoted in Songdian Commune. In addition to the commune-run large native fertilizer plant, 24 small native fertilizer plants were built this spring, producing more than 5.7 million jin of native fertilizer. The commune applied an average of 150 jin of native fertilizer per mu of wheat field. Because a lot of native fertilizer was applied, the more than 38,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune generally had large ears and full grains.

    马回营——土化肥之乡
    中共伊川县委通讯组
    河南伊川县宋店公社马回营大队，是全省著名的土化肥之乡。今年全大队的三千多亩小麦，长得好，收得多。社员们说：这样的好收成，多亏了土化肥！
    马回营大队大造土化肥是从1958年冬季开始的。大队支部抽调党员刘好谦和生产队长程逢社专搞土化肥。最初，他们对于化肥什么也不懂。可是，他们在党支部的鼓励下，坚持干下去，到处搜集原料，认真翻阅化学参考书。在熬硝酸钾的过程中，先后失败了二十次，最后终于成功了。经过一年多的努力，到1959年底，已能制造二百一十五种土化肥、十五种细化肥、九十五种土农药，其中有若干种土化肥和土农药，已经送到北京展览。伊川县在马回营大队连续举办过四次土化肥训练班，培训了七百五十名土化肥技术员。这个大队还供给外省外县二千九百份资料。今年春天，这里的土化肥厂试验烟中取氨已经成功，并且开始生产硫酸铵、氯化钾等优质化肥。
    今年全大队的小麦施用了大量的土化肥。麦子返青的时候，全部麦田每亩施了四百斤土化肥，对晚茬苗瘦的麦田每亩又追了六百斤土化肥。3月间每亩麦田又普遍追施了二十斤硝酸钾。4月，每亩又追施十五斤硫酸铵。另外，从去年冬季到麦熟，全部麦田都洒了自造的硫磺合剂药水。今年麦子长有四尺多高，但是没有倒伏；气候不够正常，也没有发生严重病害。
    马回营大队的经验已经在宋店公社很快推广。全公社除了社办的一座较大的土化肥厂外，今春又建起了二十四座小土化肥厂，生产出土化肥五百七十多万斤。全公社平均每亩麦田施了一百五十斤土化肥。因为土化肥施得多，全公社三万八千多亩小麦普遍穗大粒满。
