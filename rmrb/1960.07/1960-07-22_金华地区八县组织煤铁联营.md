Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st July: The Jinhua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang Province has organized cooperation between counties under its jurisdiction that lack coal and iron and those with relatively abundant coal and iron resources. They are jointly operating "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" for coal and iron, effectively accelerating the development of coal and iron mines and increasing pig iron production.

The eight counties participating in the joint operation are Jinyun, Yongkang, Dongyang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Kaihua, Suichang, and Qu County. Some of these counties have incomplete or scattered coal and iron resources; others have resources but lack equipment, materials, and labor. This severely restricted the development of the iron and steel industry. In May of this year, the Jinhua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party carefully analyzed the region's resources and various favorable conditions and decided to concentrate the resources of the eight counties, guided by the principles of "unified leadership, concentrated strength, guaranteed priorities, cooperative operation, each contributing its strength, and proportional distribution." They conducted unified planning and layout, concentrating efforts on establishing coal and iron bases in Qu County, Kaihua, and other locations with relatively abundant mineral resources. They established the Quzhou Coal and Iron Company, based on the Quzhou Iron and Steel Plant in the special zone.

To strengthen the leadership of the eight-county joint operation, Lu Zhixian, First Secretary of the Jinhua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the secretary in charge of industry and the Minister of Industry and Transportation personally went to the joint operation sites to specifically oversee the preparation and production work. The Prefectural Committee also assigned four cadres at the level of county party secretaries to serve as party secretary and manager of the coal and iron company. The eight counties participating in the joint operation quickly transferred a group of cadres and workers and raised the necessary funds. The Provincial Department of Metallurgy, the Department of Machinery, and other units provided a batch of steel, testing instruments, and mechanical equipment. All counties, the prefectural and special zone organs, and fraternal factories and mines promoted the spirit of cooperation, organizing a large number of materials, equipment, funds, and personnel to participate in the preparation work. As a result, this joint venture went into production in less than a month.

Although the eight-county joint operation has not been in operation for a long time, it has already enabled the rational utilization of various resources, given full play to the role of various "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups," and greatly developed coal and iron resources, resulting in a substantial increase in pig iron production. By the end of June, this joint venture had newly built and expanded more than twenty pairs of small coal kilns, two coking plants, one coal briquette factory, one iron smelting plant, and three iron mines. Production capacity has greatly improved compared to the original county-run enterprises. Among them, the daily output of pig iron increased nine times compared to before the joint operation, coal increased seven and a half times, coke increased five times, and ore increased ten times. Various economic and technical indicators have also improved significantly.

This eight-county joint venture is responsible for 80% of the coal and iron production in the Jinhua region. With such an enterprise, the Jinhua region can use its own produced coal, pig iron, and machinery to strengthen and arm county-run industries. At the same time, after participating in the coal and iron joint operation, these eight counties can also develop coal and iron production according to the conditions of each county. After the eight counties jointly operated the coal and iron enterprise, other industries have also developed accordingly. Now Jinhua, Qu County, Jinyun, Yiwu, and other counties and the Special Zone Heavy Industry Bureau have used a batch of pig iron and coal from the joint venture to rush-produce various agricultural machinery and produce fertilizers, pesticides, etc., to timely support agricultural production. Another benefit of the eight-county joint operation is the unified organization of smelting, mining, coal mining, coking, transportation, and other links, so that each link adapts to each other, fully exploiting the production potential of "small-scale modern groups," greatly saving labor, reducing round trips, and lowering production costs compared to the original situation.

The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this experience and is currently organizing its promotion throughout the province.

    金华地区八县组织煤铁联营
    大面积开发矿产资源充分发挥了设备能力煤铁产量大幅度增长劳力和运力大量节约
    据新华社杭州21日电　中共浙江省金华地委组织所属缺煤缺铁的县份同煤铁资源比较丰富的县份协作，联合经营煤铁“小土群”“小洋群”，有效地加快了煤矿、铁矿的开发速度，提高了生铁产量。
    参加联营的缙云、永康、东阳、义乌、金华、开化、遂昌、衢县等八个县，有的是煤铁资源不全、分散；有的虽有资源，但缺少设备、材料和劳动力。这样就使钢铁工业的发展受到很大的限制。今年5月，中共金华地委认真分析了本地区资源和各种有利条件，决定集中八个县的资源，以“统一领导，集中力量，保证重点，合作经营，各出其力，比例分成”的方针，进行了统一规划、统一布局，分别集中在矿产资源比较丰富的衢县、开化等地建立煤铁基地，以专区衢州钢铁厂为基础，建立衢州煤铁公司。
    为了加强八县联营的领导，中共金华地委第一书记吕志先和分管工业的书记、工业交通部长亲自到联营地点，具体抓筹建和生产工作。地委还给煤铁公司配备了四名县委书记级的干部担任党委书记和经理，参加联营的八个县也很快抽调了一批干部、工人，并筹集了需要的资金。省冶金厅、机械厅等单位支援了一批钢材、化验仪器和机械设备。各县和地、专机关以及各兄弟厂矿都发扬了协作精神，组织了大批材料、设备、资金、人员参加筹建工作。因此使这个联营企业不到一个月的时间就投入了生产。
    八县联营的时间虽然不长，但是已经使各种资源得到合理利用，充分发挥了各种“小土群”“小洋群”作用，大面积地开发了煤铁资源，生铁产量大幅度地增加。到6月底，这个联营企业，就新建和扩建了二十多对小煤窑，两个炼焦厂，一个煤球厂，一个炼铁厂和三个铁矿。生产能力比原来县营有了很大提高。其中，生铁日产量比联营前增加九倍，煤增加七倍半，焦炭增加五倍，矿石增加十倍，各种经济技术指标也有显著提高。
    这个八县联营企业担负着金华地区80％的煤铁生产任务。有了这种企业，金华地区便可以用自己生产的煤炭、生铁和机器等，加强和武装县办工业。同时，这八个县在参加煤铁联营以后，还可以根据各县条件发展煤铁生产。八县联营煤铁企业以后，其它工业也得到相应的发展。现在金华、衢县、缙云、义乌等县和专区重工业局，已经用从联营企业中分到的一批生铁、煤炭，赶制了各种农业机械和生产化肥、农药等，及时地支援了农业生产。八县联营的另一个好处，是把冶炼、采矿、采煤、炼焦、运输等各个环节统一组织，使各个环节相互适应，充分挖掘了“小洋群”的生产潜力，比原来大大节省了劳动力，减少了运输路程往返，降低了生产成本。
    中共浙江省委十分重视这个经验，目前正在全省组织推广。
