    "Eight Great Personnel" Sing of Production Management
    Chorus by Zhang Guofu, worker at Harbin Qinghua Tool Factory:
    Singing is good, the mouth opens often,
    Singing brings enthusiasm,
    Everyone works together on management,
    A roaring fire needs everyone to add fuel.

    Production Team Leader:
    I'm the production team leader in charge,
    Everyone discusses issues together,
    Personnel and plans are well-allocated,
    Only then can production win the battle.

    Technician:
    I'm not afraid of technical challenges,
    The working class has great wisdom,
    Unite everyone to work together,
    Even high mountains can be dug away.

    Accounting Staff:
    I'm the worker accounting staff,
    I turn the pages of the ledger after production is complete,
    To further reduce costs,
    I'll calculate even into the darkest night.

    Safety Technician:
    Safety work is the most important,
    People and property are national treasures,
    Do a good job in production safety,
    Socialism will come sooner.

    Mechanical and Electrical Staff:
    Keep machinery and equipment well-maintained,
    Production tasks can be ensured,
    Cherish machine tools like your eyes,
    Supervise the oiling every day.

    Tool Staff:
    Tools must be properly stored,
    Strictly prevent corrosion and rust,
    Find the cause of tool damage,
    Gradually reduce consumption.

    Materials Staff:
    Steel materials must be conserved,
    Reduce the consumption of auxiliary materials,
    Everyone uses their brains to "profit from waste,"
    Thrift and diligence bring wonderful methods.

    Quota Staff:
    Everyone talks about production quotas,
    I carefully consider them one by one,
    Everyone sticks on a "Red One,"
    The worker leaders smile happily.

    Security Staff:
    Public security and protection are the most important,
    Safety in production must be ensured,
    Eliminate accidents and plug loopholes,
    Class vigilance must be heightened.

    Concluding Chorus:
    The affairs of the factory are handled by everyone,
    "Two Participations, One Reform" is a good experience,
    "Mental" and "physical" labor are not
      separated,
    A happy paradise is in sight.
