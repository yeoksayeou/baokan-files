	The opportune time, favorable terrain, and the unity of the people result in many joyous events. If cadres can only achieve the "Four Togethers," the enthusiasm of the commune members will be even more intense. Being able to overcome difficulties and leap forward, a great harvest is certain in the autumn. Leaders must go to the front lines. I often meet with my mentor. Who is my mentor? It is labor model Huang Meishan. He works for everyone and not for himself, and has been like this for ten years. The day before yesterday, I went to ask him for advice. My mentor led me to see the crops. We walked and talked, discussing how to increase production further. We passed the pig farm and crossed the bridge. The crops everywhere were growing well. The corn sprouted red tassels, the sunflowers bloomed towards the sun, the pumpkins formed ugly knots, the soybean pods hung like whips, the east wind blew the rice waves, and the dark rice grew two feet long. A bountiful harvest is in sight through struggle. Currently, we are focusing all our efforts on controlling rice stem borers. Male and female commune members are all mobilized. We participate in collecting stem borer egg masses. After collecting the egg masses, we spray pesticides. At night, we light moth-attracting lamps. After washing our hands and feet, we enter the cafeteria. Teacher and apprentice sit at the same table, and the meal is even more fragrant. Commune members love to enjoy the cool summer nights, and new and old commune members chat about their families. The cooler the night, the more energized the conversation becomes, and good ideas for increasing production are found.

    “四同”花开
    中共江苏扬中县委第一书记　朱维中天时地利靠人和，干群团结喜事多。干部只要能“四同”，社员干劲更加浓。能克困难能跃进，定能秋熟大丰收。领导要到第一线，我与师傅常见面，我的师傅哪一个？劳动模范黄美善，他为大家不为己，十年以来如一天。前天我去请教他，师傅领我看庄稼。一边走来一边谈，研究如何再增产。出了猪场过了桥，到处庄稼长得好。玉米吐出红胡子，黄葵开了向日花，南瓜打丑结疙瘩，大豆角子把鞭挂，东风吹起稻波浪，乌黑稻子二尺长。丰收在望靠斗争，目前全力抓治螟，男女社员齐上阵，我们参加采螟块，采完螟块喷农药，夜里点起诱蛾灯。洗了手脚进食堂，师徒同桌饭更香，夏夜社员爱乘凉，新老社员谈家常。夜凉越谈越来劲，找出增产好主张。
