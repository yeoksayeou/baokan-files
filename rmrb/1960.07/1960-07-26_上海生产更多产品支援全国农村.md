    Shanghai Produces More Products to Support the National Countryside
    Irrigation and drainage, fertilizer production and power equipment, as well as various agricultural machinery, have all significantly increased compared to last year.
    Adopts the method of "district and county pairing, factory and commune pairing" to support the suburbs, and dispatched technicians to the countryside, creating outstanding achievements.
    (People's Daily, Shanghai, July 25th) Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Shanghai's industrial sector has adhered to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and comprehensively supports the technological transformation of agriculture. Since the beginning of this year, while continuing to actively support the national countryside with equipment and products, it has also adopted the form of "district and county pairing, factory and commune pairing" to vigorously support the people's communes in the suburban counties.
    The accelerated progress of agricultural technological transformation across the country requires Shanghai to provide a large amount of irrigation and drainage equipment, fertilizer production equipment, and power equipment. In order to adapt to this requirement and take into account the different characteristics of various regions, the agricultural machinery and equipment that Shanghai plans to manufacture this year will not only greatly exceed the quantity of previous years, but also greatly increase in variety and specifications. In the first half of this year, the output of agricultural diesel engines and water pumps produced by dozens of factories in the machinery industry system was more than the output of the entire last year; more than twenty electromechanical factories have completed twelve sets of fertilizer equipment with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia and seven sets of fertilizer equipment with an annual output of 2,000 tons of synthetic ammonia. In addition to continuing to produce these two types in the second half of the year, large-scale fertilizer production equipment with an annual output of 25,000 tons of synthetic ammonia will also be produced. This year, when producing agricultural machinery and equipment, various factories are also thinking about how to better exert their use in the countryside. For example, the water pumps produced in the past did not have elbows or valves, and the users had to find ways to match them themselves. This year, the relevant factories have attached three elbows and three valves to each water pump, and some have also attached flanges and anchor bolts, so that the rural areas across the country can install and use the water pumps as soon as they get them.
    Another important aspect of Shanghai's industrial support for agriculture is the production of various agricultural machinery, agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, pesticides and fertilizers. In the first half of this year, machinery industry factories manufactured more than 1,000 small threshers, rice milling machines, rice hullers, green fodder cutters, and feed crushers for the countryside, and they have been shipped out one after another. Since the beginning of this year, the output of various agricultural machinery and pesticides in the chemical industry sector has exceeded the quota every month. From January to June, the relevant factories have produced more than 1,700 sets of dual-wheel motorized tri-purpose machines and other motorized agricultural machinery, an increase of 1.77 times over the same period last year; more than 220,000 sets of manual agricultural machinery such as hand-cranked powder sprayers, an increase of 1.36 times over the same period last year; 621 tons of pesticide Dipterex, an increase of six times over the same period last year, as well as a large number of fertilizer liquid, DDT emulsion, irrigation and drainage rubber tubes, and transmission belts.
    While continuing to support the national countryside with equipment and products, the Shanghai working class also comprehensively supports the people's communes in the suburban counties with technology.
    Since around the Spring Festival this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, the city has adopted the method of "district and county pairing, factory and commune pairing, and getting to the bottom of it," with twelve districts paired with eleven suburban counties respectively. All districts have established leading groups or offices for supporting agricultural technological transformation (some districts have also established joint leading groups with paired counties), headed by responsible comrades of the district party committee, and based on large factories in the electromechanical industry in the district, equipped with other medium and small factories, to organize support groups and establish fixed and long-term support relationships with the people's communes. More than 1,000 factories in the twelve districts are paired with 172 people's communes in the eleven counties. According to the unified deployment of the districts, two or three thousand technicians have been organized to go to the countryside to support agriculture. After the technicians went to the countryside, they ate, lived, worked, and discussed with the commune members, using the commune's farm tool factory as a base to arm the farm tool factory in all aspects, and worked with the broad masses of commune members to carry out tool reforms and promote the technological transformation of agriculture.
    In arming farm tool factories and other community-run industries serving agricultural production, in accordance with the principle of self-reliance of the communes, the technicians who went to the countryside and the commune members worked together, adapted to local conditions, used local materials, manufactured and improved various indigenous equipment, innovated and repaired existing machinery and equipment, and promoted new technologies and new processes to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of manual operations. For example, the technicians dispatched by the Nanshi District helped the farm tool factories of five communes in Jinshan County establish foundry workshops, solving key problems that had not been solved for a long time. The farm tool factory of Baihe Commune in Qingpu County originally relied on manual operation. The technicians dispatched by Shanghai No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and other units helped them make more than ten kinds of equipment such as spring hammers, indigenous punching machines, and sawing machines, greatly changing the face of production technology. In addition, in accordance with the unified arrangements of the city and districts, various factories cleared out a part of the surplus equipment, tools, and parts to support the commune farm tool factories, helping the local areas gradually achieve "minor repairs without leaving the team, medium repairs without leaving the commune, and major repairs without leaving the county" for various agricultural machinery and tools.
    After the technicians went to the countryside, they also helped the members of the farm tool factories improve their technical level and armed the farm tool factories with technology. The technicians dispatched by the Hongkou District have trained 780 apprentices through individual instruction, signing apprenticeship contracts, and attending technical classes, and many of them have initially mastered basic operating skills. Du Derong, an electrician from the No. 5 State-owned Cotton Mill in Changning District, unreservedly imparted his more than 20 years of electrical experience to his farmer brothers. In just over four months, he trained more than 30 people with electrical skills for the Changzheng People's Commune in Jiading, enabling them to independently manage the commune's newly built more than 80 electric irrigation stations.
    The technicians dispatched by various districts, with the commune farm tool factory as a base, worked with the broad masses of commune members to carry out tool reforms. During the high tide of livestock tool reforms in the spring of this year, more than 19,000 pieces of livestock tools were made in just two months, so that the suburban livestock farms basically realized the mechanization or semi-mechanization of fodder cutting, the vehicle-ization of transportation, and the self-flowing of water use. Many livestock farms have also achieved the gasification of cooking feed. Technicians dispatched by Huangpu, Xuhui, Zhabei and other districts have made outstanding achievements in the reform of agricultural tools. Jing'an District once concentrated more than 70 technicians to help various communes in Qingpu County manufacture 380 sets of rice-wheat dual-purpose threshers, rice transplanters, and rapeseed threshers, and manufactured and promoted more than 1,200 kinds of tools in deep plowing, sowing, and fertilizer accumulation, and repaired and refitted more than 600 pieces. The technicians in Hongkou District, together with the commune members, manufactured and innovated more than 10,500 agricultural tools in four months, and trial-produced rice, wheat, and rapeseed tri-purpose threshers.
    Now, all industrial departments in Shanghai are further strengthening leadership, unifying arrangements, and striving to support the national countryside and suburban countryside with more and better products. On the 14th of this month, the relevant departments of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of relevant leaders from various districts. After research, it was determined that the main content of technical support at present is to vigorously carry out agricultural tool reform and agricultural and sideline product processing tool reform. A new upsurge of mass movement in industrial support for agriculture is gradually taking shape in Shanghai.

    上海生产更多产品支援全国农村
    排灌、化肥生产和动力设备以及各种农业机械等都比去年显著增长
    采取“区县挂钩、厂社挂钩”支援郊区，技术工人下乡创造了出色成绩
    本报上海25日电　上海工业部门在市委的领导下，坚持贯彻国民经济以农业为基础的方针，全面支援农业的技术改造。今年以来，在继续以设备、产品等积极支援全国农村的同时，又采取“区县挂钩、厂社挂钩”的形式，大力支援郊区各县的人民公社。
    全国各地农业技术改造的加速进行，要求上海提供大量的排灌设备、化肥生产设备和动力设备。为了适应这种要求，并照顾各地的不同特点，上海今年计划制造的农业机械设备等，不仅数量大大超过往年，品种、规格也有很大增加。机械工业系统的几十家工厂，今年上半年生产农业用柴油机和水泵的产量，比去年全年的产量还要多；二十几家机电工厂已完成年产八百吨合成氨的化肥设备十二套，年产二千吨合成氨的化肥设备七套；下半年除继续生产这两种以外，还将生产年产二万五千吨合成氨的大型化肥生产设备。各厂今年生产农业机械设备，还处处为在农村更好地发挥使用效果着想。例如过去生产的水泵，没有弯头、阀门，使用单位要自己设法配套。今年有关厂在每一台水泵上，都附了三个弯头和三个阀门，有的还附上法蓝、地脚螺丝等附件，使各地农村拿到水泵就可以安装使用。
    上海工业支援农业的另一个重要方面，是生产各种农业机械、农副产品加工机械、农药与化肥。今年上半年，机械工业各厂为农村制造小型脱粒机、碾米机、砻谷机、青饲料切割机和饲料粉碎机等一千多台，并已陆续运出。化学工业部门各种农械、农药等的产量，今年以来月月超额。1至6月份，有关工厂已生产双轮机动三用机等机动农械一千七百多具，比去年同期增长一点七七倍；手摇喷粉器等手动农械二十二万多具，比去年同期增长一点三六倍；农药敌百虫六百二十一吨，比去年同期增长六倍，以及大批肥田粉液、滴滴涕乳剂以及排灌胶管、传动带等。
    在以设备和产品继续支援全国农村的同时，上海工人阶级还从技术上全面支援郊区各县的人民公社。
    从今年春节前后开始，按照市委的指示，全市采取了“区县挂钩，厂社挂钩，一竿子插到底”的方式，十二个区分别同郊区十一个县对口挂钩。各区都成立了支援农业技术改造的领导小组或办公室（有的区还同对口的县成立联合领导小组），由区委负责同志挂帅，并以本区内机电行业的大型工厂为主、配备其他中、小型厂，组织支援小组，分别同人民公社建立固定的长期的支援关系。十二个区的一千多工厂与十一个县的一百七十二个人民公社实行对口挂钩。根据各区的统一部署，已经组织了二、三千名技术工人下乡支援农业。技术工人下乡后，同公社社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，以公社农具厂为基地，从各个方面武装农具厂，并同广大社员一起大搞工具改革，推进农业的技术改造。
    在武装农具厂和其他为农业生产服务的社办工业方面，根据公社自力更生的原则，下乡的技术工人与公社社员一起，因地制宜，就地取材，制造和改进各种土设备，革新和修理原有机械设备，并推广新技术和新工艺，实现手工操作的半机械化、机械化。如南市区下乡支援的技术工人，帮助金山县五个公社农具厂建立了翻砂车间，解决了长期未能解决的关键问题。青浦县白鹤公社农具厂，原来是手工操作，静安区重型机床厂等单位下乡支援的技术工人，帮助他们制出了弹簧鎯头、土冲床、锯木机等十几种设备，大大改变了生产技术面貌。此外，各厂还按照市、区的统一布置，清理出一部分多余的设备和工具、零件，支援公社农具厂，帮助当地逐步做到各种农业机械、工具“小修不出队，中修不出社，大修不出县”。
    技术工人下乡后，还帮助农具厂社员提高技术水平，从技术上武装农具厂。虹口区下乡的技术工人，通过个别传授、订师徒合同和上技术课等方式，已培训艺徒七百八十人次，其中不少人已初步掌握了基本操作技术。长宁区国棉五厂电工杜德荣，把自己二十多年的电工经验，毫无保留地传授给农民兄弟，在短短四个多月中，就为嘉定长征人民公社培养了三十多个掌握电气技术的人才，使他们能够独立管理公社新建的八十多个电灌站。
    各区下乡支援的技术工人，以公社农具厂为基地，同广大公社社员一起，大搞工具改革。在今年春天声势浩大的养猪工具改革高潮中，短短两个月内，就制成了畜牧工具一万九千多件，使郊区畜牧场基本上实现了切割饲料机械化或半机械化、运输车子化、用水自流化，许多畜牧场还做到了煮饲料天然气化。在农业工具改革方面，黄浦、徐汇、闸北等区下乡工人都作出了出色的成绩。静安区曾集中七十多个技术工人，帮助青浦县各公社制造稻麦两用脱粒机、插秧机、油菜脱粒机等三百八十台，并在深耕、播种、积肥等方面，制造和推广了各种工具一千二百多件，修理、改装六百多件。虹口区技术工人同社员一起，四个月内制造和革新了各种农业工具一万零五百多件，并试制了稻、麦、油菜三用脱粒机。
    现在，上海各工业部门都在进一步加强领导，统一安排，力争以更多更好的产品支援全国农村和郊区农村。本月14日，中共上海市委有关部门召集各区有关负责人开会，经过研究，确定当前以大搞农业工具改革和农副产品加工工具改革为技术支援的主要内容。一个工业支援农业的群众运动新高潮，正在上海逐步形成。
