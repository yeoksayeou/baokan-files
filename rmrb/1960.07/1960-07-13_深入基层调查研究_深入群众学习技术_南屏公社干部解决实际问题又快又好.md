    (Our dispatch) Hefei: Cadres of the Nanping Commune in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, from the Party Committee Secretary to the production team leaders, have developed a work style of conducting investigations and research and learning technology. As a result, cadres can promptly identify problems, accurately solve them, and genuinely lead production in a down-to-earth manner.
    The Nanping Commune Party Committee has deeply realized the importance of improving working methods and enhancing leadership skills through the production practice of the Great Leap Forward. In two years of exploration, they have improved their leadership of production by conducting in-depth investigations and research and making efforts to learn technology, achieving excellent results. After the establishment of the commune, in addition to delegating the Party Committee Secretary, ministers, committee members, and brigade general branch secretaries and captains at all levels to the forefront of production, the Commune Party Committee moved its office to the production team this spring. To enable all cadres to conduct widespread and sustained investigation and research and learning technology activities, the Commune Party Committee made a resolution to make cadres' adherence to investigation and research and learning technology a work system and a standard for evaluating cadre work. In implementing this resolution, all levels of cadres have formulated investigation and research projects and learning content based on the production and work situation of each period, and have launched activities through the establishment of experimental stations, observation areas, technical research rooms, and work sites. To date, the entire commune has established seven experimental stations, more than 1,500 mu of crop experimental fields, eleven canteen experimental fields, and observation areas have been established in all kinds of crop fields to observe soil, pest control, fertilization, management, and planting; field technical research rooms have been set up in all large-area high-yield fields; and key production teams and groups have been selected to establish bases according to the work of different periods, achieving the requirements of stations in brigades (experimental stations), fields in production teams (experimental fields), rooms in high-yield areas (technical research rooms) and bases for all work.
    In conducting extensive investigation and research and learning technology, all cadres in the commune focus on on-the-spot investigations and inspections in the fields, closely cooperate with experienced peasants, technicians, and commune members, adopt the methods of individual interviews and collective consultations, and ensure that tools are always in hand and books are always with them. Among the 184 cadres at the team level and above in the commune, 150 cadres have asked experienced peasants or technicians to be their teachers and have formed close friendships. Therefore, they can promptly identify problems and accurately solve them. During the spring wheat field management this year, the 6,200 mu of late-sown wheat in the commune generally had fewer tillers. After discovering this, Fei Bangliang, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee, immediately studied the problem with technicians from the experimental station and experienced peasants, and conducted actual investigations in the production teams. They found that the reason was drought and the fertilizer applied was not easily decomposed. They then conducted an experiment of watering and fertilizing, and the results were very good, with a significant increase in tillers. They immediately promoted this method, which quickly improved the 6,200 mu of late-sown wheat and more than 11,000 mu of wheat with poor tillering in the commune. Chen Yuming, the secretary of the Dahua branch of the Five-Star Brigade, discovered a few yellow leaves, as well as withered and water-stained deaths, in the wheat seedlings in the observation area this spring. He visited and consulted everywhere, and ran more than ten li to consult with technicians from the Agricultural Bureau. Everyone suspected red spiders, but there was no evidence. He got up before dawn for five consecutive days and found that 40 mu had red spiders, enabling timely pest control.
    Through investigation and research, the Party's various policies and guidelines have been correctly implemented under local conditions. For example, the implementation of the policy of multiple planting for high yields and multiple harvests, and the basic construction of fertilizer stations, have been better implemented because of in-depth investigation and finding the right approach.
    The good habit of cadres conducting investigation and research and learning technology has rapidly improved their leadership ability and technical level. Chen Degui, the secretary of the Huangcaowei Brigade Party Branch, did not understand technology when he was first transferred to the pig farm, and his leadership failed to grasp the central task. However, thanks to a year of frequent visits to the pigsty and research with the breeders, and the purchase of more than 50 books on pig raising and persistent study, he has now become a local pig-raising expert. The pig farm has grown from the original 85 pigs to more than 2,000 pigs.
    Cadres' in-depth investigation has also powerfully promoted the masses to conduct investigation and research and learn technology, forming a high tide of everyone learning technology.

    深入基层调查研究　深入群众学习技术
　　南屏公社干部解决实际问题又快又好
    本报讯　安徽省全椒县南屏公社，从党委书记到生产队长，在工作中进行调查研究和学习技术形成风气，因此，干部都能及时发现问题，准确地解决问题，真正做到踏踏实实领导生产。
    南屏公社党委在大跃进以来的生产实践中，深切体会到改进工作方法和提高领导水平的重要，在两年摸索中，他们用深入调查研究，努力学习技术的办法，改进对生产的领导，收到很好效果。在公社成立后，公社党委除了把党委书记、部长、委员，大队总支书记、队长层层下放，深入生产第一线外，今年春天，又把公社办公室搬到生产队办公。为了使所有干部能广泛持久地开展调查研究和学习技术活动，公社党委作出决议，把干部坚持调查研究和学习技术作为进行工作的一项制度，和评比干部工作的一项标准。各级干部在执行这项决议中，都根据每个时期的生产和工作情况，制定调查研究项目和学习内容，通过建立试验站、观察区、技术研究室和工作点等，展开活动。到目前止，全社建立试验站七个，作物试验田一千五百多亩，食堂试验田十一个，各种作物田间都建立了观察区，进行土壤、防虫、施肥、管理、播种等项观察；所有的大面积丰产田里，都搭棚建立田头技术研究室；根据不同时期的工作，选择重点生产队、组建立基点，达到大队有站（试验站）、生产队有田（试验田）、丰产区有室（技术研究室）各项工作有基点的要求。
    全社干部在广泛开展调查研究和学习技术中，都以田头实地调查察看为主，密切和老农、技术员、社员合作，采取个别访问、集中会诊的办法，并且做到工具不离手，书本不离身，全社一百八十四个队以上干部中，就有一百五十个干部拜请了老农或技术员为师，结成了亲密的朋友，因而都能及时发现问题，准确地解决问题。今年春季麦田管理中，全社六千二百亩晚茬麦，普遍分蘖较少。公社党委书记费邦良发现后，立即和试验站技术员，老农研究，深入到生产队实际调查，找出了原因是天旱，肥料施下不易分解。他们便进行浇水肥的试验，结果效果很好，分蘖大大增加。他们马上推广了这个办法，使全社六千二百亩晚茬麦和一万一千多亩分蘖差的麦子很快好转。五星大队大花支部书记陈玉明，今年春季在观察区发现麦苗有少数黄叶子，以及枯死、水渍死的现象，就到处访问请教，跑十里多路找农业局的技术员研究，大家都怀疑是红蜘蛛，可是又没根据，他就一连五天天不亮爬起来，查出了四十亩有红蜘蛛，使虫害及时防治。
    通过调查研究，使党的各项方针政策在当地具体条件下，得到了正确的贯彻和实施。比如多种高产多收的方针的贯彻，肥料站的基本建设，都由于深入调查，摸到了途径，贯彻得更好。
    干部养成调查研究和学习技术的良好风气，使自己的领导能力和技术水平迅速提高。公社荒草圩党支部书记陈德贵，在初调到养猪场时不懂技术，领导抓不住中心，但由于一年来时时深入猪圈，和饲养员进行研究，买了五十多本养猪书籍、坚持学习，现在已变成养猪土专家，这个猪场已由原来八十五头猪发展到二千多头。
    干部深入调查后，也有力地推动了群众进行调查研究和学习技术，形成一个人人学技术的高潮。
