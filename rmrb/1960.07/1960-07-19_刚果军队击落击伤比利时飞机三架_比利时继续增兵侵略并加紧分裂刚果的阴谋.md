　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Leopoldville: The Congolese army has resolutely struck hard at the Belgian aggressors with decisive actions. On July 17th, Congolese troops stationed in Thysville shot down one helicopter and one reconnaissance aircraft of the Belgian Air Force with automatic weapons, and severely damaged another Belgian military aircraft.

　　It is reported that the reconnaissance aircraft shot down was piloted by a Belgian Air Force Major General. The Congolese troops stationed in Thysville were among the first to initiate the struggle against the rule of Belgian officers.

　　Sources reveal that in its aggression against the young Republic of Congo, the Belgian colonialists, in addition to using large numbers of infantry, paratroopers, and armored forces, also used aircraft with rockets to attack strongholds of the Congolese army.

　　According to reports, in the Congolese capital Leopoldville, angry Congolese soldiers and civilians held a grand funeral on the 16th for a compatriot murdered by the colonialists, expressing their protest against the atrocities of the colonialists. The coffin, draped in the Congolese flag, was towed by a jeep carrying four Congolese soldiers, with machine guns placed beside the soldiers. Behind the tow truck was a truck carrying armed Congolese soldiers and a black sedan of the Congolese government. The funeral procession marched twenty kilometers throughout the city, parading past the invading Belgian paratroopers.

　　According to reports, the Belgian aggressors are not reconciled to the defeats they have suffered in Matadi and other places, and are plotting new military conspiracies, attempting to use more paratroopers, in coordination with armored forces and the air force, to launch a large-scale offensive against the port of Matadi and the city of Thysville, which are defended by the Congolese army.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Brussels: Ignoring the solemn warnings of the Congolese government, the Belgian government on the 17th airlifted three more companies of colonial troops to Congo. Two of these infantry companies left the Belgian capital by plane in the morning, and the third company took off in the afternoon. It is reported that since the beginning of the Congolese people's struggle against Belgium's continued attempts to maintain colonial rule after independence, Belgium has airlifted thirty companies of invading troops to Congo.

　　While stepping up the dispatch of troops to Congo to carry out armed suppression, the Belgian colonialists are also intensifying their political conspiracy to split Congo. The Belgian government announced on the 17th that it would send a special envoy to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, which has declared "independence," this morning. It is revealed that this decision was made after Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens received an "important letter" from Katanga Provincial Governor Tshombe. The former Belgian Governor-General of Katanga Province, Schoeller, was also summoned back to the country on the 17th and consulted with the King, Foreign Minister Wigny, and former Belgian Minister Resident to Congo, van der Meersch, on the same day.

　　According to Western news agencies, the statement issued by the Belgian government after the cabinet meeting on the 16th is "the first step towards recognizing the independence of Katanga." This statement praised the maintenance of "order and security" in Katanga province. At the same time, the Belgian Special Envoy to Katanga Province, Aspremont Lynden, made a statement to the press in Elisabethville, saying that Belgium is prepared to provide Katanga with technical and economic "assistance." He sophistically argued that this "assistance" does not mean formally recognizing Katanga's "independence," while emphasizing that Belgium will not "interfere" in Katanga's "internal affairs." Brussels Radio even more blatantly said on the evening of the 17th that Belgium has assured Katanga Provincial Governor Tshombe that Belgium will not tolerate any foreign "interference" in Katanga's "internal affairs."

　　In addition, Belgium is also attempting to have the United Nations approve its acts of aggression against Congo. The Belgian representative to the United Nations, Loridan, wrote a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the evening of the 16th, requesting a so-called "investigation" into the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against colonialism.

　　刚果军队击落击伤比利时飞机三架
　　比利时继续增兵侵略并加紧分裂刚果的阴谋
    新华社18日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军队以坚决行动狠狠打击比利时侵略者。17日，驻太斯维尔的刚果部队用自动武器击落了比利时空军一架直升飞机和一架侦察机，并把另一架比利时军用飞机打得遍体鳞伤。
    有消息说，被击落的那架侦察机是由一个比利时空军少将驾驶的。驻在太斯维尔的刚果军队，是这次首先掀起斗争、反对比籍军官统治的刚果部队之一。
    消息透露，比利时殖民主义者在侵略年轻的刚果共和国时，除使用大量步兵、伞兵和装甲兵以外，还使用了带有火箭的飞机，攻击刚果军队的据点。
    据报道，在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，愤怒的刚果军民在16日为一位被殖民者杀害的同胞举行了隆重的葬礼，表示对殖民者暴行的抗议。复盖着刚果国旗的棺材由一辆乘有四个刚果士兵的吉普车拖着，士兵们身旁放着机关枪。在拖车后边是一辆载着刚果武装士兵的卡车和刚果政府的一辆黑色大轿车。参加葬礼的游行队伍在全城走了二十公里，在入侵的比利时伞兵面前列队走过。
    据报道，比利时侵略者并不甘心在马塔迪等地遭到的失败，正在策划新的军事阴谋，企图用更多的伞兵，在装甲兵和空军的配合下，大规模地进攻由刚果军队守卫着的马塔迪港和太斯维尔城。
    新华社18日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：不顾刚果政府的严正警告，比利时政府17日又空运殖民军三个连到刚果去，其中两个步兵连是在上午乘飞机离开比利时首都，第三个连在下午起飞。据报道，自从独立后的刚果人民反对比利时继续企图维持殖民统治的斗争开始以来，比利时空运到刚果去的侵略军已经达到三十个连。
    在加紧派兵去刚果实行武装镇压的同时，比利时殖民主义者还加紧策动分裂刚果的政治阴谋。比利时政府17日宣布，它要派出一个特使在今天清晨乘飞机前往宣布“独立”的刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔。据透露，这个决定是在比利时首相伊斯更斯收到加丹加省长冲伯的一封“重要信件”之后作出的。比利时驻加丹加省的前总督肖列也已经在17日奉召回国，并且当天就同国王、外交大臣维尼和前比利时驻刚果的驻节大臣范德梅什进行了磋商。
    据西方通讯社报道，比利时政府在16日内阁会议后发表的声明，是“走向承认加丹加独立的第一个步骤”，这个声明赞扬在加丹加省保持了“秩序和安全”。同时，比利时驻加丹加省特派使节阿斯普勒蒙·林登在伊利沙伯维尔向报界发表声明说，比利时准备给加丹加以技术和经济“援助”。他诡辩说，这种“援助”并不意味着正式承认加丹加“独立”，同时他又强调指出，比利时不会“干涉”加丹加的“内政”。布鲁塞尔广播电台17日晚上甚至更加露骨地说，比利时已经向加丹加省省长冲伯保证，比利时不会容忍任何外国“干涉”加丹加“内政”。
    此外，比利时还企图使联合国批准它对刚果的侵略暴行。比利时驻联合国的代表洛加丹在16日晚上写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求对刚果人民反对殖民主义的爱国正义斗争进行所谓“调查”。
