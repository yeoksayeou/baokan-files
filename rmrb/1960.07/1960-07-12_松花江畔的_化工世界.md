　　The “Chemical World” on the Banks of the Songhua River
　　By our reporter Zhao Yuqing

　　Chemical Factories Everywhere
　　Arriving in Jilin City, one sees chemical factories everywhere. Stepping out of the station, the first thing that catches the eye is a huge red banner that reads: "The masses learn chemistry, the masses run chemical industries." Starting from the station square, and walking randomly through the streets and alleys, one sees large and small chemical factories everywhere, with white characters on black plaques. Inside the gray brick houses, are ceramic reaction tanks, brick-built drying furnaces, and iron pots converted into heating kettles. Women use these simple devices to produce a wide variety of chemical products. In the courtyards, stand rows of hydrochloric acid furnaces, indigenous sulfur connection furnaces, calcium carbide furnaces, and various reverberatory furnaces, producing basic chemical raw materials such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and calcium carbide. Coming to the mountain valleys in the suburbs, we saw commune members building houses on the spot, hollowing out the heart of the thick wooden stakes to make reaction tanks, and drilling holes in the heart of the thin wooden poles to make pipes, and then building some ingenious iron and wood structures and ceramic structures, thus building forest chemical factories, using local wood by-products to produce pine root oil, turpentine, rosin, tannin extract and other forest chemical products. After some small chemical factories have a foundation, they build larger chemical factories on the open spaces along the Songhua River.

　　The urban area on the north bank of the Songhua River, where the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company is located, is the area with the greatest momentum in running chemical industries, and it has been called the "Chemical World" by the people. Around the three large-scale chemical factories, countless small chemical factories have been established. Even within the factory area and inside the workshops, some small factories are set up. A workshop in the dye factory runs more than a dozen factories, and the corridors and corners of the workshop are crowded with jars and cans. Pits are dug in the open space outside the workshop, pots are buried, pipes are connected, and wooden sheds are built. Most of these small factories use the waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue discharged from the three major chemical factories as raw materials. Their slogan is: "Absorb all waste gas, drink all wastewater, and eat all waste residue."

　　In addition to commune members of urban and rural people's communes running chemical factories and large-scale chemical enterprises running chemical factories, other industries also run affiliated chemical factories or chemical workshops. For example, the famous Jilin Paper Mill runs a chemical branch factory mainly for recovering waste liquid, and the Jilin Grain Processing Plant runs a chemical factory for processing rice husks and wheat husks. In addition, iron and steel plants run coking plants, hospitals run pharmaceutical factories, sugar factories run alcohol factories, as well as government agencies, schools, shops, sauce gardens, slaughterhouses run various chemical factories. Even the city's several bathhouses have installed pipelines to recover boiler steam and manufacture pure distilled water.

　　Knocking on the Door of the Chemical World
　　A few years ago, chemistry and the chemical industry were still unfamiliar to most people in this city, especially the residents. In 1958, after the Party issued the call for all the people to run industry, the people of Jilin City emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and the chemical industry began to appear everywhere on the streets of the city and in the mountain valleys of the suburbs, forming a surge of enthusiasm for running chemical industries throughout the city.

　　Initially, in a civil house with peeling walls and incomplete doors and windows in the Chuanying District of this city, a small chemical factory was born. This small chemical factory was founded by demobilized soldiers Liu Sheng and Zou Mingqi. They used the sulfuric acid waste liquid from the three major chemical factories in Jilin and the iron scraps from the machinery factory to produce ferrous sulfate. This incident alarmed the people of the whole city, and they all went to visit. Subsequently, many ferrous sulfate factories appeared throughout the city.

　　Once the masses' minds are liberated, their wisdom flows like a spring. The trend of experimenting with new products using two or more substances has appeared everywhere. Jars and cans were placed in the former courtyards, flasks and beakers were placed in the corners of factory workshops, housewives began to go to bookstores to select chemistry books, and chemistry knowledge lectures were held in workers' clubs and classrooms of spare-time schools. Many people who did not know chemical symbols in the past gradually became experts. Zhu Jinxian, a rice-making worker and Communist Party member of the Jilin Grain Processing Plant, used to deal with rice all day long, milling the rice and throwing away the rice husks. Over time, the rice husks piled up into small mountains. After the mass movement of all people running industry was launched, he thought that the grain processing plant should also run some other industries, so he focused on the rice husk pile. He burned, dry-distilled, and decomposed the rice husks, and extracted eighteen kinds of products from them after hundreds of experiments. Subsequently, with the support of the factory's Party general branch, he led a group of workers and built several small factories, using rice husks to produce more than a dozen chemical products. Now, he is the director of the comprehensive utilization workshop of this factory.

　　The establishment of urban people's communes promoted the blossoming of the chemical industry all over the city. Under the unified planning and arrangement of the people's communes, funds were raised, and housewives and other idle labor forces were organized to set up chemical factories on every street. At present, there are already four hundred and ninety-six small chemical factories set up in the city.

　　Let the "Chemical Tree" Take Root and Flourish
　　The chemical industry run by all the people has brought about an unprecedented prosperous scene in the "Chemical City", and the chemical industry in the city has developed rapidly. Jilin City is increasingly becoming a chemical industry base with a reasonable layout and a complete system.

　　The mass movement of running chemical industries by all the people in Jilin City is carried out in accordance with the principle of "large (factories) leading small (factories), small supporting large, combining large and small, and promoting each other". Yang Jun, the deputy manager of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, has a very good analogy. He said that the mass movement of running chemical industries by all the people in Jilin City is like a big tree. The large state-run enterprise, the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, is the trunk, and the hundreds of small chemical factories are the roots and leaves. These small chemical factories deeply root their roots in the soil, absorb the abundant local resources, and supply sufficient raw materials, so that the trunk can grow vigorously. Relying on the support of the trunk, lush branches and leaves grow, bearing rich fruits. That is to say, with this batch of small chemical factories, large enterprises have established raw material bases locally, and at the same time have processing plants, so that this "chemical tree" can take root and flourish, bearing abundant fruits.

　　松花江畔的“化工世界”
　　本报记者　赵玉庆
　　到处是化工厂
    来到吉林市，看到到处是化工厂。走出车站，首先映入眼帘的就是一幅巨幅的红色标语，上面写着：“群众学化工，群众办化工”。从车站广场出发，随便在大街小巷里穿行，到处都看到挂着白底黑字牌匾的大大小小化工厂。灰砖房里，摆满陶瓷制成的反应罐、砖头砌成的干燥炉和铁锅改成的加热釜。妇女们就用这些简单的设备生产名目繁多的化工产品。院子里，矗立着一排一排的盐酸炉、土法接硫炉、电石炉和各种反射炉，生产盐酸、硫酸、电石等基本化工原料。来到郊区的山坳里，我们看到公社社员们就地挖土造房，把粗木桩的心部挖空作成反应罐，把细木杆的心部穿空作成管道，再作些铁木结构和陶瓷结构的巧妙设备，就建成林产化工厂，用当地的木材副产品，生产松根油、松节油、松香、栲胶等林产化学产品。一些小型化工厂有了基础以后，又在松花江畔的空地上，修盖较大的化工厂。
    吉林化学工业公司所在的松花江北岸市区，是办化工声势最大的地区，这里已经被人们称作“化学世界”了。在规模宏大的三大化工厂四周，办起了数不清的小化工厂。即使在厂区内部和车间内部还办了一些小厂。染料厂有一个车间办了十几个厂，车间里的走廊和角落挤满坛坛罐罐，车间外的露天地上挖了坑，埋上了锅，通上了管道，搭上了木板棚。这些小厂多半都利用三大化工厂排出的废气、废液、废渣作原料。他们的口号是：“吸尽废气，喝光废水，吃净废渣”。
    除了城乡人民公社社员办化工厂和大型化学企业办化工厂之外，其它行业也办了附属的化工厂或化工车间。例如著名的吉林造纸厂办了以回收废液为主的化工分厂，吉林市粮谷加工厂办了处理稻皮和麦壳的化工厂。此外，如钢铁厂办焦化厂、医院办药厂、制糖厂办酒精厂，以及机关、学校、商店、酱园、屠宰场办各种化工厂，甚至全市几家澡堂子也安装了管道，回收锅炉蒸汽，制造纯净的蒸馏水。
    敲开化学世界的大门
    几年前，化学和化学工业对于这个城市的大多数人，特别是街道群众来说还是陌生的。1958年，党发出了全民办工业的号召之后，吉林市人民解放了思想，破除了迷信，化学工业开始在城区的街道上和郊区的山坳里到处出现，形成了满城闹化工的热潮。
    最初，在这个城市船营区的一间墙皮剥落、门窗不全的民房里，诞生了一个小化工厂。这个小化工厂是由转业军人刘升和邹鸣歧创办的。他们用吉林三大化工厂的硫酸废液和机械厂的铁屑子，制出了硫酸亚铁。这件事惊动了全城人民，都纷纷前去参观。接着，全城出现了许多硫酸亚铁工厂。
    群众的思想一经解放，他们的智慧就像泉水一样涌流不断。用两种和两种以上物质试验新产品的风气到处出现。从前的四合院里摆上了坛坛罐罐，工厂车间的角落里放上了烧瓶烧杯，过去的家庭妇女开始走入书店选购化学书籍，工人俱乐部和业余学校的课堂上开办了化学知识讲座，许多过去不认识化学符号的人逐渐成为内行。吉林市粮谷加工厂的制米工人、共产党员朱进贤，过去成天和稻谷打交道，把稻谷轧成米，把稻皮扔掉。日子久了，稻皮堆成了小山。开展全民办工业的群众运动以后，他想粮谷加工厂也该办点其它工业，就在稻皮堆上打主意。他把稻皮燃烧、干馏、分解，经过几百次试验，从中提炼出十八种产品。接着，在厂党总支的支持下，领着一群工人，建立了几座小工厂，用稻皮生产了十几种化工产品。现在，他已经是这个厂综合利用车间的主任。
    城市人民公社的建立，促进了化学工业在全城遍地开花。在人民公社的统一规划、统一安排下，筹集资金，组织家庭妇女和其它闲散劳动力，在每一条街道上都办起了化工厂。现在全市办起的小型化工厂已经有四百九十六个。
  让“化工之树”根深叶茂
    全民办化工，使“化工城”出现了空前的繁荣景象，全市化学工业发展很快。吉林市日益成为一个布局合理、体系完整的化学工业基地。
    吉林市的全民办化工运动是按照“以大（厂）带小（厂），以小辅大，大小结合，互相促进”的原则开展起来的。吉林化学工业公司副经理杨浚同志有一个很好的比喻。他说，吉林市的全民办化工运动好比一棵大树，国家办的大企业吉林化学工业公司是树干，数以百计的小型化工厂是根和叶。这些小化工厂，把它们的根深深地扎在泥土里，吸取当地丰富的资源，供应充足的原料，使树干茁壮成长。依靠树干的支持，又长出繁茂的枝叶，结出丰硕的果实。这就是说，有了这批小型化工厂，大企业就在本地建立了原料基地，同时也有了加工厂，这棵“化工之树”就可以根深叶茂，果实累累。
