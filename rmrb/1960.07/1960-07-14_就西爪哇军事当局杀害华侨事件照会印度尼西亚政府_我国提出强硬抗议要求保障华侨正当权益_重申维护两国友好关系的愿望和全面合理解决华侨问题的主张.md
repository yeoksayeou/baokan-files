Xinhua News Agency, July 13th

China has lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian government regarding the atrocities committed by the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, in killing innocent Overseas Chinese. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China delivered a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on July 11, 1960. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its respects to the Indonesian Embassy in China and hereby makes the following representations regarding the bloody incident in which the military authorities of West Java, Indonesia, dispatched military police to forcibly relocate Overseas Chinese in the Cima area of the Brebes Regency in West Java, resulting in the killing of Overseas Chinese by gunfire. The Ministry requests that the Embassy convey this to the Indonesian government.

On July 3, 1960, the military authorities of West Java dispatched dozens of armed military police to Cima, Brebes Regency, West Java Province, to forcibly relocate local Overseas Chinese. During the forced relocation, Indonesian military police shockingly opened fire with submachine guns on defenseless Overseas Chinese women and children. Yang Mu-mei, the wife of Overseas Chinese Lin Dunhua, who was four months pregnant, was shot and killed on the spot. Ye Jinniang, the wife of Overseas Chinese Lin Yu, was shot seven times and lay on the ground crying for help. The military police not only forbade anyone from providing assistance but also threatened to open fire if anyone came forward. Only after repeated requests from the Overseas Chinese was Ye Jinniang transported to the hospital half an hour later, but she died en route due to the severity of her injuries. In addition, two other Overseas Chinese were injured, and several were arrested.

That afternoon, the military authorities of West Java sent three tanks full of armed personnel to patrol Cima, creating an atmosphere of terror and intimidating the Overseas Chinese, even claiming that killing a few more Overseas Chinese would be the same. After the tragedy occurred, Mao Xinyu, the Consul of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, who was on vacation in Bandung, immediately requested the military authorities of West Java to conduct a joint on-site investigation. However, this reasonable request was unreasonably rejected. The Chinese government lodges a strong protest with the Indonesian government against this atrocity of the military authorities of West Java, Indonesia, in killing innocent Overseas Chinese.

The course of events shows that the massacre of Overseas Chinese in Cima was by no means accidental. Recently, anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities have been intensified in Indonesia. Following the Indonesian authorities' forcible seizure of the "Da Bao Kang" vessel and the house arrest of Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Ma-chen, the military authorities of West Java launched a second large-scale forced relocation of Overseas Chinese starting in late May 1960. During the forced relocation, Indonesian military police resorted to various barbaric means against the Overseas Chinese, including arrests, summons, beatings, cutting off residential water and electricity supplies, and sealing off houses and property. The military authorities in Cima even openly threatened that they would not hesitate to cause bloodshed in order to force the Overseas Chinese to relocate. This tragic incident of killing Overseas Chinese is clearly deliberately created by forces hostile to China and Indonesia's friendship.

It must be pointed out that when the military authorities of West Java carried out the first forced relocation of Overseas Chinese at the end of 1959 and the beginning of 1960, the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia lodged representations with the Indonesian government, demanding the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and the cessation of forced relocations and all persecution activities against Overseas Chinese. In his reply to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on March 26, 1960, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio explicitly stated that the Indonesian government had fulfilled the Chinese government's request to halt the forced relocation in West Java. On June 29, Ambassador Huang Zhen met with Foreign Minister Subandrio and raised the issue of the second forced relocation in West Java, requesting the Indonesian government to take immediate measures to stop it. Foreign Minister Subandrio stated that the Indonesian government had sent Suska, the Director-General of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Bandung to investigate and stop the forced relocation activities. However, it is extremely regrettable that the second forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in West Java has not only not stopped but has intensified, and even the tragic incident of killing Overseas Chinese in Cima has occurred. This is in complete contradiction with the repeated promises made by the Indonesian government.

The Chinese government has always believed that maintaining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the two peoples. The Chinese government has consistently advocated resolving the issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia in a comprehensive and reasonable manner through consultation. The tragic incident of killing Overseas Chinese that occurred in Cima cannot but shock the Chinese government. This tragedy has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people and the vast number of Overseas Chinese, thereby bringing a serious impact on the relations between the two countries. In order to safeguard the friendship between China and Indonesia and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, the Chinese government resolutely demands that the Indonesian government publicly apologize for the atrocities committed by the military police of West Java in killing Overseas Chinese, severely punish the murderers who killed Overseas Chinese in Cima, compensate the families of the deceased Overseas Chinese, bear the medical expenses of the injured Overseas Chinese and compensate them for their losses, immediately release the arrested Overseas Chinese, and immediately take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The Chinese government also demands that the Indonesian government immediately cease the forced relocation and all forms of persecution against Overseas Chinese. The Chinese government awaits a response from the Indonesian government.

Please accept the highest respects.

    就西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨事件照会印度尼西亚政府
　　我国提出强硬抗议要求保障华侨正当权益
　　重申维护两国友好关系的愿望和全面合理解决华侨问题的主张
    新华社13日讯　中国政府就印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害无辜华侨的暴行向印度尼西亚政府提出强硬的抗议。中华人民共和国外交部为此于1960年7月11日给印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆照会一件，照会全文如下：印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚驻华大使馆致意，并且谨就印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局派遣军警在西爪哇勃良安州芝马圩强迫华侨迁移，开枪打死华侨的流血事件申述如下，请大使馆转达印度尼西亚政府。
    1960年7月3日西爪哇军事当局派遣武装军警数十人到西爪哇省勃良安州芝马圩，强迫当地华侨迁移。在迫迁中，印度尼西亚军警竟然用手提机枪对手无寸铁的华侨妇孺开枪射击。华侨林敦华的妻子、怀孕四个月的杨木妹中弹当即死亡。华侨林玉的妻子叶金娘身中七弹，卧地呼救，军警不仅不准救护，反而威吓说如有人上前救护就开枪。只是经华侨的请求，叶金娘才在半小时后被运往医院，但因伤势过重，在途中死去。此外还有两名华侨受伤，数名华侨被逮捕。
  当日下午西爪哇军事当局又派三辆坦克，满载武装人员在芝马圩巡逻，制造恐怖气氛，对华侨进行威吓，并且声称，多打死几个华侨也是一样。惨案发生后，正在万隆休假的中国驻雅加达总领事馆领事毛欣禹，立即向西爪哇军事当局提出共同到现场进行调查的要求，但是，这一合理的要求却遭到无理的拒绝。对于印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局这种杀害无辜华侨的暴行，中国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出强硬的抗议。
    事情的经过表明，芝马圩杀害华侨的惨案绝不是偶然的。最近以来，在印度尼西亚，反华排华的活动更加加紧。继印度尼西亚有关当局武力劫持“大宝康”轮和武力软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕的事件之后，西爪哇军事当局从1960年5月下旬开始，又对华侨进行了第二次大规模的武力逼迁。在逼迁过程中，印度尼西亚军警对华侨采取了逮捕、传讯、殴打、切断住宅水电供应、标封房屋和财产等种种蛮横手段。芝马圩军事当局甚至公然威胁说，为了强迫华侨迁移，不惜制造流血事件。这次发生的杀害华侨的惨案，显然是敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力蓄意制造的。
    必须指出，当1959年底和1960年初西爪哇军事当局对华侨进行第一次武力逼迁时，中国政府和中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆曾经向印度尼西亚政府提出交涉，要求保护华侨的正当权利和利益，停止对华侨的逼迁和一切迫害活动。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约阁下在1960年3月26日给陈毅外交部长的复信中，明确表示，印度尼西亚政府已经实现了中国政府关于停止西爪哇武力逼迁的要求。6月29日，黄镇大使同苏班德里约外长阁下会谈时，就西爪哇的第二次武力逼迁活动提出交涉，要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施加以制止。苏班德里约外长阁下表示印度尼西亚政府已经派外交部亚洲和太平洋司司长苏斯卡到万隆调查和停止逼迁活动。但是，令人十分遗憾的是，对西爪哇华侨的第二次逼迁不仅没有停止，反而加紧进行，甚至发生了在芝马圩杀害华侨的惨案。这同印度尼西亚政府一再作出的诺言是完全背道而驰的。
    中国政府始终认为，维护中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系是符合两国人民的愿望和根本利益的。中国政府并且一贯主张，通过协商来全面、合理地解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题。这次在芝马圩发生的杀害华侨的惨案不能不使中国政府感到十分震惊。这次惨案已经激起了中国人民和广大华侨的极大愤慨，从而给两国关系带来了严重的影响。为了维护中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友谊和保障华侨的正当权利和利益，中国政府坚决要求印度尼西亚政府就这次西爪哇军警杀害华侨的暴行公开道歉，严惩芝马圩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤死难华侨的家属，负担受伤华侨的医药费用和赔偿他们的损失，迅速释放被捕华侨，立即采取有效措施保证今后不再发生类似事件。中国政府并且要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止对华侨的逼迁和各种迫害活动。中国政府等待着印度尼西亚政府的答复。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
