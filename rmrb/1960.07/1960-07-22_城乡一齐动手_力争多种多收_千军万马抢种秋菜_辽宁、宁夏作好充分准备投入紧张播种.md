Urban and Rural Areas Work Together, Striving for More Planting and Harvesting
Thousands Upon Thousands of People Rush to Plant Autumn Vegetables
Liaoning and Ningxia Make Full Preparations and Plunge into Tense Planting

(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 21st) Liaoning's rural areas are seizing the current excellent opportunity, mobilizing thousands of troops and horses to launch a sudden rush to plant autumn vegetables. According to statistics up to the 14th, Fuxin, Chaoyang, and Shenyang cities have already rushed to plant over 50,000 mu of autumn vegetables. In the suburban areas of Fuxin City, 70% of the labor force has been投入into the rush planting movement, and urban and suburban areas have coordinated to dispatch more than 26,000 people, and have now planted more than 10,000 mu of radishes and Chinese cabbage. Chaoyang City rationally organized the labor force and formed professional teams. From the 11th to the 14th, it has planted more than 20,000 mu of vegetables.

Liaoning Province has a large proportion of industrial and mining towns and a large urban population, and the supply of vegetables in winter and spring has always been a major problem. Recently, in accordance with the spirit of taking agriculture as the foundation and grasping both grain and vegetables, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that vegetable production should only be better than last year, not worse. After two vegetable work conferences, it was determined that the province would sow 246,000 hectares of autumn vegetables, an increase of 24% over last year, with an average of one to one and a half fen of vegetable land per person in the province. Now the plans of many cities and counties have been implemented in production teams.

The biggest feature of autumn vegetable production in Liaoning Province this year is that preparations are sufficient and actions are rapid. This spring, according to the Provincial Party Committee's instruction to "reserve more seeds and reserve good seeds," all localities prepared enough vegetable seeds. At the same time, comprehensive arrangements were made for the manure and irrigation equipment needed for vegetable fields. In the suburbs of Shenyang City, 289 new electric wells have been drilled this year, and 113 pumping stations have been repaired; approximately 70% of the vegetable fields can be irrigated.

In the high tide of rushing to plant autumn vegetables, many places are also actively using all available vacant land to expand the planting area of vegetables.

(Our newspaper, Yinchuan, 21st) In order to ensure the large amount of vegetables needed by the people of all ethnic groups in the cities and villages this winter and next spring, the Party organizations and people's committees at all levels in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are very concerned about the sowing of autumn vegetables. In order to strengthen the leadership of counties and cities in the work of sowing autumn vegetables and help various localities solve some specific problems in the production of autumn vegetables, the Agricultural Department and the Commercial Department of the Autonomous Region held a vegetable production and marketing work conference in Wuzhong City in early July for counties and cities in the Yellow River Irrigation Area. The commercial departments purchased tens of thousands of kilograms of Chinese cabbage seeds and radish seeds from Shandong, Hebei and other places, and supplied various localities with a large number of pesticides, sprayers, and chemical fertilizers.

After some preparation, all localities have now started to投入the tense work of sowing autumn vegetables. Recently, all organs, organizations, factories, mines, and schools in Shizuishan City have extracted thousands of laborers and more than 1,000 vehicles. In addition to sowing autumn vegetables in their own units, they have also helped three communes in the suburbs to sow autumn vegetables and send manure to vegetable fields. After the communes rushed to harvest spring wheat on the 18th, they immediately transferred 30% of their labor force to投入the sowing of autumn vegetables. In addition to planning to replant 5,500 mu of autumn vegetables in summer stubble fields and interplant vegetables in millet fields, all public canteens and commune members' families in Wuzhong City have planted vegetables on all scattered vacant land in front of and behind their houses. Under the leadership of several secretaries of the Secretariat of the Yinchuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people's communes in the suburbs of Yinchuan City have launched a high tide of sowing autumn vegetables, striving to plant all the autumn vegetables that should be planted by the end of the month.

    城乡一齐动手　力争多种多收
    千军万马抢种秋菜
    辽宁、宁夏作好充分准备投入紧张播种
    本报沈阳21日电　辽宁农村各地抓紧当前大好时机，出动千军万马，突击抢种秋菜。到14日统计，阜新、朝阳、沈阳三个市，已经抢种秋菜五万多亩。阜新市郊区各人民公社70％的劳动力都投入了抢种运动，城市和远郊区配合出动两万六千多人，现在已经种完萝卜、白菜一万多亩。朝阳市合理组织劳动力，成立专业队伍，从11日到14日，已种菜两万多亩。
    辽宁省工矿城镇比重大，城市人口多，冬春蔬菜供应一直是一个大问题。最近，根据以农业为基础，粮菜一齐抓的精神，省委提出蔬菜生产只能比去年好，不能比去年坏。经过两次蔬菜工作会议讨论，确定全省播种秋菜二十四万六千公顷，比去年增加24％，平均全省每人有一分到一分五厘菜地。现在许多市县的计划已经落实到生产队。
    辽宁省今年秋菜生产最大特点是准备充分、行动迅速。各地今春即根据省委“多留种、留好种”的指示，准备下足够的菜籽。同时对菜田所需的粪肥和灌溉设备作了全面的安排。沈阳市郊区，今年新打的电井有二百八十九眼，还修好了抽水站一百十三处；大约70％的菜田可以得到灌溉。
    在抢种秋菜高潮中，不少地方还积极利用一切空闲土地扩大蔬菜播种面积。
    本报银川21日电　为了保证城市和乡村各族人民今冬明春所需要的大量蔬菜，宁夏回族自治区各级党组织和人民委员会对秋菜的播种工作都十分关心。自治区农业厅和商业厅为加强各县市对播种秋菜工作的领导和帮助各地解决秋菜生产中的一些具体问题，7月初曾在吴忠市召开了黄河灌区各县市蔬菜产销工作会议。商业部门从山东、河北等地购进了好几万斤白菜籽和萝卜籽，并给各地供应了大批农药、药械和化肥等。
    各地经过一番准备后，现在都开始了投入紧张的秋菜播种工作。石咀山市各机关、团体、厂矿、学校最近已抽出了几千名劳动力和一千多辆车辆，除播种本单位的秋菜外，还帮助郊区三个公社播种秋菜和给菜地送粪。各公社在18日抢收完春小麦以后，立即抽调30％的劳力投入秋菜播种。吴忠市除计划在夏槎地里复种五千五百亩秋菜和在糜子地里间种蔬菜外，全市所有的公共食堂和社员家庭，把庄前宅后的一切零星空闲地上都种了蔬菜。银川市郊各人民公社，在中共银川市委书记处几位书记的领导下，已展开播种秋菜的热潮，力争月底把应种的秋菜全部种上。
