　　Beijing Heat and Power Plant Launches Crash Program for Main Structure

　　(Our report) The Party Committee of the Beijing Heat and Power Plant construction site concentrated manpower and resources and adopted small-scale battle methods to complete the main structure project (excluding the foundation) of the 50,000-kilowatt turbine in only twenty-five working days, and the project quality met the design requirements.

　　During the construction, the plant organized key parts and key processes into dozens of small battles. For each small battle, corresponding technical management measures and solutions for materials, manpower, and machinery were formulated, thus greatly accelerating the progress of the project. For example, in the battle to rush the deoxidation room and coal bunker room, it was necessary to tie 50 tons of steel bars and erect 2,000 square meters of formwork. The entire construction site concentrated 90% of the steelworkers and carpenters on these two projects, completing the task originally scheduled for two days in one night. Building the circulating water pipe was the final key project of this endeavor. The Party General Branch of the Fourth Engineering Office concentrated the electricians and plumbers, mechanics, processing plant workers, and welders, welding machines, and hoisting equipment from three other construction sites under its jurisdiction to this construction site for a crash program, completing the project, which would have taken twelve days to complete, in just two and a half days.

　　北京热电厂突击主体工程
    本报讯　北京热电厂工地党委集中人力物力，采取小战役方法，只用二十五个工作日就建成五万瓩汽轮机主体结构工程（不包括基础），工程质量达到设计要求。
    在施工中，这个厂把重点部位、重点工序组成为数十个小战役，每个小战役都制订了相应的技术管理措施和解决材料、人力、机械的办法，因而大大加快了工程进度。如在突击脱氧间和煤仓间的战役中，需要绑扎五十吨钢筋，支模二千平米，全工地就集中了90％的钢筋工和木工进行这两项工程，一个晚上就完成了原计划两天才能完成的任务。修建循环水管，是这项工程最后的一个关键项目。第四工程处的党总支集中了所属的水电队、机械队、加工厂和其他三个工地的电焊工、电焊机和吊装设备到这个工地来进行突击，使这个需要十二天才能修成的工程，只用两天半就完成了。
