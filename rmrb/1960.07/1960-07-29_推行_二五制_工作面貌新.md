Promoting the "Two-Five System" Brings a New Look to Work

    Break Through a Point to Drive the Whole Area
    According to the spirit of the "Two-Five System" and the characteristics of the vast area and inconvenient transportation in the local area, Wutai County, Shanxi Province, conscientiously promoted the "Three-Seven System" working method. Thousands of cadres in the county went to the fields to participate in and lead production, promoting the current drought resistance and seedling protection movement.
    In the previous period, Wutai County suffered from severe drought. The county party committee, on the one hand, called on cadres throughout the county to do everything possible to carry out the drought resistance struggle, and on the other hand, instructed Zheng Dianwen, the standing secretary of the county party committee, to go to the severely drought-stricken Xicun Management District to create experience in mountain drought resistance, in order to break through one point and guide the whole area. Zheng Dianwen spent his days with the commune members climbing mountains and ridges, searching for water sources; at night, he studied water diversion methods with cadres and experienced farmers, and finally found many drought resistance methods such as channel-linking channels, reservoir-nesting reservoirs, water lifting irrigation, and digging dry wells. Subsequently, manpower was organized to complete thirteen water conservancy projects in a timely manner, initially changing the local drought situation. After the county party committee promoted this experience, it set off a drought resistance movement throughout the county, expanding paddy fields by more than 27,000 mu, allowing more than 7,000 mu of drought-stricken crops to get water.

    Go Deep into the Grassroots to Promote Production
    The Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hangjin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to the spirit of the "Two-Five System", decided to implement the "Five-Fifteen System" in this banner, the "Three-Seven System" in the communes, and the "Two-Five System" in the production brigades. The "Five-Fifteen System" means that within twenty days, five days are spent on concentrated meetings to study issues and learn, and fifteen days are spent on grasping production below. The Hangjin Banner Committee adopted this working method due to the vast local area, inconvenient transportation, and scattered residences of farmers and herdsmen.
    At present, more than 90% of the banner committee members and commune leading cadres in Hangjin Banner have gone deep into the grassroots, promoting agricultural and pastoral production. Li Tingzhen, the first secretary of the Tala Gou Commune Party Committee, went to the area where the sheep were suffering from the epidemic, and adopted a method combining leaders, veterinarians, and herders. After many experiments, he discovered that "Dipterex" could treat sheep brain worms. Promoting this method has cured more than 12,000 sick sheep.

    Act as a Good "Logistics Department"
    Cadres of the commercial system in Tangyin County, Henan Province, promoted the "Two-Five System" working method, went to the countryside for investigation and research, and acted as a good "logistics department" for agricultural production.
    According to the characteristics of commercial work, the specific practice of Tangyin County's commercial system in promoting the "Two-Five System" is: five days a week are spent on investigation and research and assisting work at the grassroots level, and two days are spent returning to the office to report situations, study work, and learn.
    After the cadres of the commercial system in Tangyin County implemented the "Two-Five System", they were able to discover and solve problems in agricultural production that urgently needed commercial support in a timely manner. Xu Tang, manager of the native products station of the County Commercial Bureau, found that there was a shortage of water lifting tools for drought resistance in Mukou Commune, so he notified the Chengguan Store to transfer 400 water buckets and water tanks each, powerfully supporting the drought resistance struggle.

    Work and Study Promote Each Other
    Since Renhuai County, Guizhou Province, implemented the "Two-Five System", it has achieved significant results. One of the main effects is that it ensures that grassroots cadres have fixed study time, achieving mutual promotion of work and study. After studying "On Practice" and basic agricultural knowledge, Li Zizhen, secretary of the Luban Commune Party Committee, understood that every matter must be investigated and researched in order to draw correct conclusions. Recently, he produced together with commune members and found that some rice seedlings were turning yellow. A few commune members said that it was because the rice transplanter was not pulling up the seedlings. Li Zizhen then found technicians and experienced farmers to study in detail and found that the reason why the rice seedlings turned yellow was the low soil temperature and the presence of waterlogging insects in the rice roots. They immediately drained the water and dried the fields, and used a mixture of grass ash, lime, and oil cake for topdressing. In less than ten days, more than 1,000 mu of yellowed rice seedlings turned into first-class seedlings.

### 推行“二五制”工作面貌新

    推行“二五制”工作面貌新
    突破一点带动全面
    山西五台县根据“二五制”精神和当地地区辽阔、交通不便的特点，认真推行“三七制”工作方法。全县几千名干部到田间参加生产领导生产，促进了当前的抗旱保苗运动。
    前一个时期，五台县干旱严重，县委一面号召全县干部千方百计地开展抗旱斗争，一面责成县委常务书记郑殿文到干旱严重的西村管理区去，和群众一起创造山区抗旱的经验，以突破一点，指导全面。郑殿文白天和社员们翻山越岭，寻找水源；晚上和干部、老农研究引水办法，终于找到了渠连渠、库套库、提水灌溉和挖旱井等许多抗旱办法。随即组织人力，及时完成了十三处水利工程，初步改变了当地的干旱状况。县委推广这一经验后，在全县掀起了抗旱运动，共扩大水田二万七千多亩，使七千多亩干旱庄稼喝到了水。
    深入基层推动生产
    中共内蒙古自治区杭锦旗委员会根据“二五制”精神，决定在这个旗实行“五、十五制”、公社实行“三七制”、生产大队实行“二五制”的工作方法。“五、十五制”，就是在二十天内，五天集中开会研究问题和学习，十五天在下面抓生产。杭锦旗委采用这一工作方法，是由于当地地区辽阔、交通不便和农牧民居住分散。
    目前，杭锦旗百分之九十以上的旗委委员和公社领导干部已经深入到基层，促进了农牧业生产。塔拉抅公社党委第一书记李庭祯到发生疫病的羊群的地方，采用领导、兽医、牧工三结合的方法，经过多次试验，发现“敌百虫”药可以治疗羊脑虫。推广这一办法，已治好病羊一万二千多只。
    当好“后勤部”
    河南汤阴县商业系统干部推行“二五制”工作方法，到农村调查研究，当好农业生产的“后勤部”。
    根据商业工作的特点，汤阴县商业系统推行“二五制”的具体做法是：每星期有五天到基层调查研究和帮助工作，两天时间回机关汇报情况、研究工作和学习。
    汤阴县商业系统干部实行“二五制”后，能及时发现和解决农业生产方面急需商业支援的问题。县商业局土产站经理徐唐在亩口公社发现抗旱缺少提水工具，就通知城关商店调来水桶水罐各四百只，有力地支援了抗旱斗争。
    工作学习互相促进
    贵州仁怀县推行“二五制”以来，收到了显著效果。其中一个主要效果是：保证基层干部有固定的学习时间，做到了工作学习互相促进。鲁班公社党委书记李自珍学习了“实践论”和农业基本知识后，懂得了每一件事都必须通过调查研究，才能得出正确的结论。最近，他同社员一起生产，发现有些秧苗发黄。有少数社员说是因为插秧机栽秧不起秧。李自珍又找技术员和老农一道详细研究，找出秧苗发黄的原因是地温低，秧根有涝虫。他们随即排水晒田，并用草木灰、石灰和油枯混合追肥，不到十天，一千多亩发黄的秧苗变成了一类苗。
