    Doing Is Learning
    Ma Guotai, Worker at Qinghai Wool Processing Factory
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the vast majority of our factory's comrades are full of confidence, working diligently and cleverly, and have come up with many inventions. However, a few comrades lack confidence and have a fear of difficulties. They say, "We are illiterate; we can do rough work, but not innovation." Some also say, "We don't understand technical theory; we can't think of anything." Obviously, these comrades mainly do not understand the irrefutable truth that "knowledge comes from practice."
    What is practice? Practice is the activity of people transforming the objective world. We workers are active participants in practice. Through practice, we not only create rich material wealth but also create spiritual wealth and accumulate rich knowledge and experience. Therefore, we workers are the most knowledgeable and the most intelligent. Saying that you are "uneducated," "ignorant," "a roughneck," etc., is underestimating yourself. Strictly speaking, it means that superstition has not yet been eliminated and thinking has not been liberated.
    Of course, most of the old workers in our factory came from the "paupers" of the old society. Their education level is low, and their technical theoretical level is poor. Especially for many new products, such as wool grease, which only appeared during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we are relatively unfamiliar with their operation. However, to change this situation, to turn unfamiliarity into familiarity, and to turn not knowing into knowing, the important thing is still practice.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in "On Practice," "If you want knowledge, you must participate personally in the practice of changing reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself." In "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out, "Reading is learning, but using is also learning, and it is more important learning…Often, we do not learn well before we start doing, but we learn by doing; doing is learning." This points out a good way to learn knowledge for us: learning in practice, learning while doing.
    Many facts prove that only by actively participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, working hard while doing, and diligently studying, can we improve our technical and scientific knowledge level and transform from not knowing to knowing. Comrade Zhang Shengxiang, the director of the grease workshop in our factory, was originally an uneducated ordinary worker. In 1957, the Party gave him an important task: to extract wool grease from wool scouring wastewater. At that time, he thought, "Major cities like Shanghai and Tianjin cannot produce wool grease. How can I, an illiterate roughneck, do this?" But then he thought, "The Party asked me to do it. As long as I listen to the Party, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome." He boldly accepted this glorious and arduous task and studied and experimented with his comrades. If he failed once, he would find the reason for the failure, study the improvements, and then experiment again. In this way, after many experiments, he finally succeeded in producing crude wool grease. Then, according to the Party's instructions, through continuous efforts, learning while doing, he overcame difficulties such as lack of equipment and lack of technical data, and successfully trial-produced anhydrous refined wool grease that fully met the requirements of the national pharmacopoeia, paving the way for our country to produce this new product. This year, he also used electrolysis to make bleaching powder and sodium hydroxide from waste intestinal casing water and made monosodium glutamate and soy sauce essence from waste intestinal casings. After these wastes are made into new products, they can create a lot of wealth for the country throughout the year. Recently, he has also established ambitious goals to study extracting a newer product from wool grease. Extracting this product from wool grease not only lacks technical data, but it has also never been heard of before. However, he has already tasted the sweetness of learning from "doing" and is determined to successfully trial-produce this product in a very short time. These facts have made me deeply realize the close relationship between "doing" and "learning." The process of doing is also the process of learning. As long as we start doing, we can learn more knowledge and quickly improve our technical level; and the increase in knowledge opens the way for better and greater work. Therefore, the question of whether or not we can innovate does not lie in whether we understand technical theory, but in the word "doing." As long as we break with superstition, liberate our minds, and actively engage in work, the difficulties of not understanding technical theory will gradually be overcome in practice.

    干就是学
    青海省羊毛加工厂工人　马国泰
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我厂的绝大多数同志都是信心百倍，苦干巧干，搞出了不少创造发明。但是，也有少数同志信心不高，有畏难情绪。他们说：“咱是大文盲，干粗活还行，搞革新创造可不行。”也有的说：“咱不懂技术理论，想不出啥名堂来。”显然，这些同志主要是不懂得“知识来源于实践”这一颠扑不破的真理。
    什么是实践呢？实践就是人们改造客观世界的活动。我们工人是实践的积极参加者，通过实践不仅创造了丰富的物质财富，而且创造了精神财富，积累了丰富的知识和经验。因此，我们工人是最有知识，最有智慧的。说自己“没文化”、“没知识”、“大老粗”等等，是自己小看了自己，严格点说，是迷信还没有破除，思想还没有解放。
    当然，我厂的老工人差不多都是从旧社会来的“穷光蛋”，文化低，技术理论水平差；尤其是像羊毛脂等好多新产品，是在1958年大跃进中才出现的，因此在操作方面比较生疏。但是，要改变这种情况，使生疏变为熟悉，使不懂变为懂，重要的问题还在于实践。
    毛泽东同志在《实践论》中教导我们说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃”。在《中国革命战争的战略问题》中，毛泽东同志又指出：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。……常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”这就给我们指出了一个学习知识的好途径：在实践中学习。一边干一边学。
    好多事实证明，只有积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动，在运动中一边干，一边刻苦钻研，努力学习，才能够提高自己的技术科学知识水平，才会由不懂转化为懂。我厂油脂车间主任张生祥同志，原来是一个没文化的普通工人，1957年党把一项重要的任务交给了他，要他在洗毛废水中提取羊毛脂。当时他想：“上海、天津等大城市都不能生产羊毛脂，我一个目不识丁的大老粗怎么能搞这玩艺儿？”但又一想：“党叫咱干，只要听党的话，就没有克服不了的困难。”他大胆地接受了这一光荣而艰巨的任务，和同志们共同研究试验，失败一次，就找失败的原因，研究改进后再试验。就这样经过多次的试验，终于试验成功了粗制羊毛脂。接着，他又根据党的指示，经过不断努力，边干边学，突破了缺乏设备、缺乏技术资料等难关，试制成功了完全合乎国家药典要求的无水精制羊毛脂，为我国生产这种新产品开辟了途径。今年，他又在废肠衣水中采取电解方法，制出了漂白粉和氢氧化钠；用废肠衣制成了味精和酱油精。这些废物制成新产品后，全年可给国家创造很多财富。最近，他又树立了雄心壮志，研究在羊毛脂中提取一种更新的产品。从羊毛脂中提取这种产品不仅没有技术资料，而且从来也没有听说过。但他已经尝到了从“干”中学的甜头，决心在很短时间内把这项产品试验成功，从这些事实中使我深深体会到“干”与“学”的密切关系，干的过程也就是学习的过程。只要干开了，就能学到更多的知识，很快提高技术水平；而知识的增加又为更好的大干开辟了道路。因此，能不能革新的问题，还不在于懂不懂技术理论，而在一个“干”字上。只要我们破除迷信，解放思想，积极地干起来，不懂技术理论的困难，也就会在实践中逐渐被克服。
