Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 5th: CPI National Committee Secretariat Secretary Ranadive published an article in the June issue of the "New Age" monthly, exposing the economic harm to India caused by the capital input of Western countries, particularly the United States.

    The article points out that India's economic planners rely on the West, especially the United States and institutions under its control, to obtain India's "main foreign aid." American private capital also wants to get involved in India. The article reveals the "suggestions" recently made to India by three major Western bankers who visited India: reduce the construction projects of India's Third Five-Year Plan, and stated that Western countries cannot guarantee to provide "aid" on a long-term basis. The article points out that this "suggestion" "clearly tells us that India must deal with the West with a begging bowl every year," therefore, "the formulation of India's plan must depend on the unpredictable changes in Western budgets and the moods of financiers."

    The article says that due to the increase in foreign debt, India must pay debt expenses with more foreign exchange income. The World Bank's delegation to India in 1958 estimated India's government debt at around six billion rupees. It predicted, "By 1960-1964, 8% of all foreign exchange income in our (India's) current account must be set aside to pay these debt expenses." The article says that India's government debt has now increased to 9.2 billion rupees, and the total debt has reached 15.78 billion rupees. Therefore, the article sharply asks: "How much more must we increase the amount of our foreign exchange income set aside to repay our debts?"

    The article also points out that in order to earn foreign exchange to repay foreign debts, foreign debt becomes a force that can influence India's import and export trade and its direction, increasing India's dependence on the markets of Western countries and countries influenced by them. Earning more and more dollars has become a necessity, and this determines the direction and pace of our trade with the dollar area.

    The article says that if India cannot greatly increase exports and bridge the gap between imports and exports, it "will have to seek new loans to repay overdue loans. Once this process begins, you will be trapped in it, and your creditors will propose new conditions that endanger your economic freedom."

    Ranadive's article also exposes the various harsh conditions of Western loans. He cited as an example that the United States stipulates in accordance with the "aid" agreement concluded with India that American "aid" must be transported by American ships, and as a result, freight alone accounts for 19% of the value of the goods purchased by India from the United States under the agreement. The article points out, "In addition, American prices are much higher than world prices." Moreover, the United States controls a large amount of rupees through these loans, "It can legally use 10% of it to support its (Indian) enterprises or find Indian partners."

    The article points out that the interest rate on loans from the U.S. Development Loan Fund is very high, "This type of loan cannot be used for industries in the public sector (except for the transportation industry, etc.), but can be used for industries in the private sector." The article points out that the interest rates on loans given to India by Britain and West Germany are also shockingly high.

    印共书记处书记兰那地夫载文揭露
    依靠西方“援助”严重危害印度经济
    印度债台高筑每年将带着讨饭碗同西方打交道
    据新华社新德里5日电　印度共产党全国委员会书记处书记兰那地夫在6月份的“新世纪”月刊上著文揭露西方国家、特别是美国的资本输入在经济上对印度的危害。
    文章指出，印度的经济计划工作者依靠西方、特别是美国和在其控制下的机构，来获得印度的“主要外援”。美国私人资本也想染指印度。文章揭露了最近访问过印度的西方三位大银行家向印度提出的“建议”——削减印度第三个五年计划的建设项目，并表示西方国家不能保证在长期的基础上提供“援助”。文章指出，这个“建议”“明明白白地对我们说，印度必须每年带着讨饭碗同西方打交道”，因此，“拟订印度的计划时必须取决于西方预算不可捉摸的变化和金融家的情绪”。
    文章说，由于外债的增加，印度就必须以更多的外汇收入支付债务费用。世界银行访印代表团在1958年估计印度的政府债务为六十亿卢比左右。它预测，“到1960—1964年，我们（印度）往来账目上的全部外汇收入的8％必须留出来支付这些债务费用”。文章说，现在印度的政府债务已增至九十二亿卢比，总债务已达到一百五十七亿八千万卢比，因此文章尖锐地问道：“我们的外汇收入中留出来偿付我们的债务的，必须再增加多少呢？”
    文章还指出，为了赚取外汇偿还外债，外债就成为一种能够左右印度的进出口贸易和它的方向的力量，使印度增加了对西方国家和受它们影响的国家的市场的依附。赚取愈来愈多的美元已经成为一种必要，而这确定了我们同美元地区的贸易的方向和步伐。
    文章说，如果印度不能大大增加出口，弥合进出口之间的距离，它“将不得不谋求新的贷款来偿还拖欠的贷款。一旦这一过程开始，你就会陷在里面，而你的债权人就会提出危害你经济自由的新条件。”
    兰那地夫的文章还揭露西方贷款种种苛刻的条件。他举例说，美国根据同印度缔结的“援助”协定规定，美“援”必须用美国船只来载运，结果仅运费一项就占印度根据协定向美国购买的物品的价值的19％。文章指出，“此外，美国的价格比世界价格高得多。”而且美国通过这些贷款掌握了大量卢比，“它可以用其中的10％来合法地支持它（在印度）的企业或寻找印度同伙。”
    文章指出，美国开发贷款基金会贷款的利率很高，“这种贷款不能用于公营部分的工业（运输业等除外），却能用于私营部分的工业。”文章指出英国和西德给印度的贷款的利率也高得惊人。
