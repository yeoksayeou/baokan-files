    Recycling Packaging Cloth
    The Wuhan Grain Factory has already achieved 100% recycling of packaging cloth, not requiring a single foot of new cloth from the state for the entire year. In the past two years, this factory has saved 9.7 million meters of cotton cloth by recycling flour sacks. Their specific methods are: 1. Organize a recycling network for flour and sugar sacks; 2. Strengthen management; 3. Returned cloth sacks are拆洗修补 (dismantled, washed, repaired) by designated personnel to ensure repeated use. (Guo Qiang)

    回收包装布
    武汉市的粮食工厂已经做到包装用布100％地回收使用，全年不向国家要一尺新布。两年多来，这个厂由于回收面袋共节约了九百七十万米棉布。他们的具体做法是：一、组织面袋糖袋回收网；二、加强管理；三、收回来的布袋，由专人负责拆洗修补，做到一用再用。（国强）
