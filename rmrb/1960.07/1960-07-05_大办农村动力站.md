    Vigorously Develop Rural Power Stations
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in rural areas, people's communes in many regions are vigorously developing and utilizing local power resources and vigorously building power stations. In the vast countryside, thousands of hydroelectric stations, wind power stations, biogas digesters, natural gas wells, as well as small power plants and gas stations have been and are being built. These power stations provide extremely rich new power to the vast rural areas, which is of great significance for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture in our country.
    The goal of our country's agricultural technological transformation is to strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and a considerable degree of electrification nationwide in about ten years. The so-called agricultural mechanization is mainly composed of two factors: one is various working machines with higher efficiency, and the other is sufficient power equipment to drive these machines. Only with sufficient working machines and power equipment to replace human and animal power can agricultural mechanization and modernization be realized.
    At present, our agricultural labor productivity is still not high, and most of our production needs to be done manually. We should not only replace low-efficiency backward tools with high-efficiency new tools or agricultural machinery, but also replace human and animal power with mechanical power. Only by changing the tools originally operated by people to be manipulated by power such as water, electricity, and wind, and by using water, electricity, wind, gas, and other power sources to do the work originally done by people, can we better发挥the effectiveness of new tools and agricultural machinery, and can we even higher increase labor productivity. Therefore, vigorously developing power resources, applying various energy sources to production and labor, and letting mechanical power and natural power replace human and animal power is a very important part of the rural technical innovation and technical revolution, and is a decisive link in the agricultural technical transformation from semi-mechanization to mechanization.
    Vigorously developing natural energy sources and widely applying various natural energy sources such as water, wind, and gas to production and livelihood service undertakings is of particular importance to us. The reason is very simple: natural energy is everywhere; it is simple and easy to use natural energy, does not require complicated equipment, costs very little money, and can be done by communes and teams, so it can be developed in large quantities and popularized in a relatively short period of time. This is very beneficial for promoting agricultural production and solving the difficulty of labor shortage.
    Our country's natural energy is very rich. Rivers crisscross the country, and we have also built a large number of water conservancy projects. Water can not only irrigate fields, but also is a huge energy source. Countless rivers, streams, reservoirs, mountain ponds, and irrigation canals can generate a certain degree of power if they are developed and utilized. Wind is even more ubiquitous and present in all seasons. As for natural gas, not only does Sichuan have it, but according to a survey of seventeen provinces and cities in East China, Central South, and Northeast China, shallow natural gas exists in most areas along rivers, seas, rivers, and lakes. Natural energy sources such as water, wind, and gas, especially water and wind power, are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. Once they are used, they can generate endless power. According to extremely incomplete statistics, there are currently 120,000 rural hydropower stations built nationwide, with 1.25 million horsepower; there are 330,000 wind power equipment; and a large number of natural gas wells have been drilled in coastal, river, and lake areas. The utilization of these natural power sources has greatly saved labor and improved equipment utilization, creating a large amount of wealth for people's communes. In the past, Fengli Commune in Yiyang County, Henan Province, used 800 laborers and 340 livestock year-round for rice milling and flour milling. Since the construction of three hydropower stations, the commune's more than 30,000 people's food has been processed by water mills, which can save 700 laborers and all the livestock. The Feihuai Commune of Bengbu, Anhui, established a small wind power station, which can save more than 4,000 yuan in fuel costs for commune members' lighting alone. Since the vigorous development of natural gas in Chuansha County, Shanghai last year, it has created 2.21 million yuan in wealth, while saving more than 2,700 laborers who have been put into industrial and agricultural production.
    Is natural energy difficult to use? It is not difficult, and it can even be said to be very easy. The vast rural people's communes in our country have accumulated rich experience in utilizing natural energy and have created many good methods that are both simple and easy to implement, and save labor and materials. As long as we conscientiously promote these experiences and learn these methods, all regions can widely utilize their rich natural energy. For example, in the utilization of water power, the most important equipment is the water turbine. In order to save steel and facilitate widespread manufacturing and mass promotion, we have been able to use wooden water turbines to replace metal water turbines, solving the problem of insufficient raw materials and simplifying the manufacturing method. In terms of water energy utilization, we have created the experience of small water for large use and multiple use of water, comprehensively utilizing water resources, and combining mountain management, water management, soil management, and power generation. Jinhua County, Zhejiang, built a reservoir on a 60-kilometer river, which can irrigate more than 300,000 mu of land, and plans to build more than 100 hydropower stations and power stations. Now 49 have been completed. In terms of wind power utilization, a variety of wind turbines have been created, and the problems of automatic steering to face the wind and automatic adjustment of speed to adapt to the wind force have been initially solved, and large wind turbines with a power of 50 horsepower have appeared. With the improvement and improvement of wind turbine technology, some places have seen some wind power stations. The situation in terms of natural gas utilization is the same. We have not only solved the technical problem of on-site development and on-site utilization, but also further solved the technical problem of multi-site utilization from one development site. Now, some places not only use natural gas for lighting, processing, and heating, but also compress it to drive cars, tractors, and transport it to factories to drive machines and generate electricity. The solution of these technical problems and the creation of these experiences are undoubtedly very beneficial to the promotion of natural power utilization. As long as these experiences are applied in accordance with local conditions, the cause of utilizing natural energy in rural areas of our country can be greatly improved.
    Natural energy must be greatly developed and greatly utilized. Should other energy sources also be developed and utilized? Of course, we must develop and utilize them, and as long as possible, we must also greatly develop and utilize them. Many energy sources, such as electricity, gas, biogas, etc., are not so difficult to develop and utilize. Due to the importance attached by leaders in Henan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Shanxi and other provinces, mass movements are carried out in the work, and a series of technical and equipment problems have been solved in motor manufacturing and raw materials. Indigenous methods have been invented and created for manufacturing silicon steel sheets, indigenous methods for smelting copper, and indigenous methods for wire drawing, and mechanical rectifier generators have been successfully trial-produced. With a generator, the problem of the power station can be said to be mostly solved. As long as it is installed on a hydropower station, a hydropower station can be established. In terms of gas utilization, Gucheng People’s Commune in Yidu County, Shandong Province, due to the firm implementation of the policy of taking materials locally and adapting to local conditions, created underground gas generators (digging pits on the spot), water filters, corn cob filters, and using bituminous coal fines to refine semi-coke as raw materials for generating gas, creating favorable conditions for realizing gasification. Gas can replace solid and liquid fuels to drive machines, providing simple and inexpensive power for agricultural and sideline production and commune-run industries. As for the manufacture and utilization of biogas, the experience of various places is even richer. For the utilization and promotion of biogas, it is not a question of introducing experience. This problem has been solved in most areas. Now the problem is to strengthen leadership and strive to promote it. It is a question of leadership's determination and in-depth and specific guidance.
    In the vigorous development of rural power stations, it is inevitable to encounter some difficulties in technology, funds, and other aspects. However, it should be believed that as long as we adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift in running stations and self-reliance, rely closely on the masses, and with the support of the country and the cooperation of various departments, difficulties can be overcome. Hongdong County has, through such efforts, cultivated and trained 715 people in power station construction, operation, management, and equipment manufacturing in the past year or so, and local industries have also begun to learn how to manufacture 10 to 30 kilowatt generators and low-voltage electromagnetic products. In terms of funds, they also mainly rely on the strength of the people's communes themselves, and the problem has been solved.
    The vigorous development of power stations must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The leading organs of various regions and people's communes should investigate the local hydropower, wind power, biogas, and other power resources and make an overall plan for development and utilization. When arranging development projects, we must not only clarify the key points of development, but also consider the mutual cooperation of various energy sources; when determining the layout of power stations, we must not only see the immediate urgent needs, but also estimate the future development prospects. After formulating a practical and feasible plan, we must make great determination, strengthen leadership, take measures seriously, and seek to achieve it in stages and in batches. As for those places where power stations already have a foundation, in addition to continuing to build some projects according to needs and possibilities, special attention should be paid to the management and use of existing projects to ensure that one project is built well, managed well, and used well, so as to achieve safe operation and stable production.
    The new thing of vigorously developing power stations has emerged in response to the needs of agricultural technological transformation, and its future is booming and unlimited. Leaders in all places should pave the way for this new thing and promote it to move forward continuously. It can be predicted that under the leadership of party committees at all levels and with the great support of the national industry, the mass movement to vigorously develop power stations will surely blossom everywhere across the country and make great contributions to the cause of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification.

    大办农村动力站
    在农村技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多地区的人民公社正在大力开发和利用当地的各种动力资源，大办动力站。在广大农村中，已经和正在建立成千上万的水力站、风力站、沼气发生池、天然气井以及小型发电站、煤气站。这些动力站给广大农村提供了极其丰富的新的动力，对加速我国农业技术改造具有重要的意义。
    我国农业技术改造的奋斗目标是争取在十年左右的时间内，在全国范围内基本上实现农业机械化、水利化和相当程度的电气化。所谓农业机械化，主要是由两个因素构成的：一是效率更高的各种工作机械，一是足够推动这些机械的动力设备。只有有了代替人力和畜力的足够的工作机械和动力设备，才能实现农业机械化和现代化。
    目前，我们的农业劳动生产率还是不高的，我们的大部分生产，都需要用人工去作。我们不仅应该把效率低的落后工具换成效率高的新式工具或农业机器，还应该把人力、畜力换成机械动力。只有把原来由人操作的工具改成由水力、电力、风力等动力去操纵，由人作的劳动叫水、电、风、气等动力去作了以后，才能更高地发挥新式工具和农业机械的效能，才能更高地提高劳动生产率。因此，大力开发动力资源，把各种能源运用到生产劳动中去，让机械动力和自然动力代替人力和畜力，是农村技术革新和技术革命中一个十分重要的组成部分，是农业技术改造由半机械化到机械化的一个决定性的环节。
    大搞自然能源，把水、风、气等各种各样的自然能源广泛地运用到生产和生活服务事业中去，对我们有特别重要的意义。理由很简单：自然能源到处有；利用自然能源简便易行，不需复杂的设备，花钱很少，社社队队都能办，因而能够大量发展，能够在比较短的时间内普及，这对于推动农业生产，解决劳动力不足的困难，都是十分有利的。
    我国的自然能源是非常丰富的。全国河流纵横，特别是我们又兴建了大量的水利工程。水，不仅可以灌田，而且是一个巨大的能源，无数的江河溪流、水库山塘、灌溉渠道，只要加以开发利用，都可以发出一定程度的动力。风，更是到处皆有、四季常在的。至于天然气，不仅四川有，据华东、中南、东北地区十七个省市调查，沿江、海、河、湖地区大都有浅层天然气。水、风、气等自然能源，特别是其中的水力和风力，是取之不尽，用之不竭的，一旦把它利用起来，就可以发出无穷无尽的力量，据极不完全的统计，目前全国已经建成的农村水力站十二万处，一百二十五万马力；已有风力设备三十三万台；沿海、河、湖地区已打大量天然气井。这些对自然动力的利用，大大地节省了劳动力和提高了设备利用率，为人民公社创造了大量的财富。河南省宜阳县丰李公社，过去常年用于碾米磨面的劳动力有八百人和三百四十头牲口，自从建起三个水力站以后，全社三万多人的食粮改由水碾、水磨加工，可以节省出七百个劳动力和全部的牲口。安徽蚌埠肥淮公社建立了一个小型的风力发电站，仅社员照明就可节省油费四千多元。上海市川沙县去年大搞天然气以来，已经创造财富二百二十一万元，同时节约出二千七百多劳动力投入了工农业生产。
    自然能源是不是很难利用呢？不难，甚至还可以说很容易，我国广大农村人民公社在利用自然能源方面，已经积累了丰富的经验，创造了很多既简便易行，又省工省料的好办法。只要我们认真推广这些经验，学习这些办法，各地都可以把丰富的自然能源广泛地利用起来。比如在水力的利用方面，最重要的设备是水轮机，为了节约钢材和便于广泛制造和大量推广，我们已能用木制水轮机代替金属水轮机，解决了原料材料不足问题，简化了制造方法。在水能利用方面创造了小水大用、一水多用的综合利用水力资源的经验，把治山、治水、治土和发电结合起来。浙江金华县在一条六十公里的河道上，修了一个水库，能灌溉三十多万亩土地，并计划建立一百多座水力站和电力站，现在已经建成了四十九座。在风力利用上，多种多样的风力机已经被创造出来，风力机的自动转向迎风和适应风力大小自动调整速度的问题也已经初步解决，并且出现了功率达五十马力的大风力机。随着风力机技术方面的改进和提高，有些地方已经出现了一些风力发电站。天然气的利用方面的情况同样如此，我们不仅已经解决了就地开发就地利用的技术问题，也进一步解决了一处开发多处利用的技术问题，现在有些地方不仅用自然气照明、加工、取暖，而且经过压缩已经可以用来开汽车、拖拉机和运到工厂带动机器和发电了。这些技术问题的解决，这些经验的被创造出来，无疑对推广自然动力的利用是很有好处的，只要把这些经验因地制宜地运用起来，就可以把我国农村利用自然能源的事业大大提高一步。
    自然能源要大大开发，大大利用，其他能源是否也要开发、也要利用呢？当然要开发利用，而且只要有可能，也同样要大大开发，大大利用。有许多能源，比如电力、煤气、沼气等等，并不是那么难以开发难以利用的，河南、浙江、福建、湖南、山西等省由于领导重视，工作中大搞群众运动，在电机制造和原材料方面，解决了一系列的技术问题和设备问题，发明创造了土法制造矽钢片，土法炼铜，土法拔丝等，并试制成功了机械整流发电机。有了发电机，发电站的问题就可以说解决大半了，只要把它安在水力站上，水力发电站就可以建立起来了。山东益都县古城人民公社在利用煤气方面，由于坚决贯彻了就地取材、因地制宜的方针，创造了地下煤气发生炉（就地挖坑作成）、水过滤器、玉米芯子过滤器和烟煤末炼半焦作为发生煤气的原料，为实现煤气化创造了有利的条件，山东省已经有五十多个县开始推广他们的经验。煤气可以代替固体和液体燃料开动机器，为农副业生产和社办工业提供了简易、价廉的动力。至于沼气的制造和利用，各地的经验就更丰富了，对于沼气的利用和推广，不是介绍经验的问题，这个问题在大部分地区已经解决了，现在的问题是加强领导，努力推广的问题了，是领导的决心和深入具体指导的问题了。
    在大办农村动力站中，难免碰到技术、资金等方面的一些困难。但是，应该相信，只要坚持勤俭办站和自力更生的方针，紧紧依靠群众，再加上国家的支援和各部门的协作，困难是可以克服的，洪洞县就是经过这样的努力，在最近一年多的时间里，培养训练出电站建设、操作、管理和设备制造方面的人材七百一十五名，地方工业也开始学会制造十至三十瓩发电机和低压电磁品的本领。在资金方面他们也主要依靠人民公社本身的力量，得到了解决。
    大办动力站必须有计划、有步骤地进行。各地区和人民公社的领导机关应当对于当地的水力、风力、沼气和其他动力资源加以勘查，作出开发利用的全面规划。在安排发展项目时，既要明确发展的重点，也要考虑多种能源的互相配合；在确定动力站的布局时，既要看到眼前的迫切需要，也要估计到将来的发展前途。制定了一个切实可行的规划以后，就要下大决心，加强领导，认真采取措施，分期分批，求其实现。至于那些动力站已有基础的地方，除了根据需要和可能继续增建一部分工程以外，特别要注意现有工程的管理和使用，保证建好一处，管好一处，用好一处，做到安全运转，生产稳定。
    大办动力站这个新事物，已经在农业技术改造中应运而生了，它的前途方兴未艾，不可限量。一切地方的领导者都应当为这个新生事物开辟道路，推动它不断地向前猛进。可以预料，在各级党委的领导下，在国家工业的巨大支援下，大办动力站的群众运动一定会在全国范围内遍地开花，在农业机械化、水利化、电气化的事业中作出伟大的贡献。
