Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: Vice Premier Chen Yi met with five Nepalese youth and student organization representatives this afternoon: K.P. Shrestha, M.R. Shrestha, D.R. Dhakwa, P.R. Shrachandra, and G.N.S. Dawadi.

During the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi had a cordial and friendly conversation with the young Nepalese friends. He expressed his apologies for the unfortunate accidental incident that recently occurred on the Sino-Nepalese border and thanked Prime Minister Koirala for his friendly attitude in handling the incident. K.P. Shrestha, Vice President of the Nepal Youth Federation, said that he hoped that the minor border incident would not affect the traditional friendship between China and Nepal, which has lasted for thousands of years. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that China and Nepal should live together in friendship because there is no fundamental conflict of interest between our two countries. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between Asian and African countries. We are all friends and should live together in friendship.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also said that China and Nepal face common tasks. The economies of both our countries are still backward, and we both need to build modern industries, develop rich resources, and improve the material living standards of our people. We should support and help each other and cooperate in a friendly manner for a long time.

K.P. Shrestha, on behalf of the Nepalese youth, students, and people, expressed his heartfelt thanks to China for its economic assistance to Nepal. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that China's assistance to Nepal is very meager. Our two countries provide mutual assistance and support to each other. The Nepalese government and people recognize the People's Republic of China and advocate for the restoration of our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations, which is a form of support for us. We express our gratitude for this.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we hope to see Nepal become more prosperous and strong, and we hope to see all Asian and African countries become more prosperous and strong. Your prosperity and strength is our support, and similarly, our prosperity and strength is also support for all Asian and African countries. There is no jealousy between us, because only when we all support each other and become prosperous and strong together can we shatter the war policies and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States.

D.R. Dhakwa, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Nepal Youth Organization, spoke about his impressions of visiting China. He said that he saw the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture everywhere in China, and China's construction undertakings are undergoing new changes every day. He said, "We have found that the Chinese people have a deep friendship with the Nepalese people, and the Chinese people are willing to be friendly with the Nepalese people." He also conveyed Prime Minister Koirala's friendly wishes to the Chinese people. M.R. Shrestha, a representative of the Nepal Youth League, said: "The people of China and Nepal have been friendly for thousands of years. Our friendship cannot be destroyed by anything, and it will last as long as the Himalayas that connect our two countries." Vice Premier Chen Yi asked the Nepalese youth representatives to convey the Chinese people's greetings to Prime Minister Koirala and the Nepalese people, saying: "The people of our two countries will be friendly for thousands and thousands of years. Our friendship can stand the test of time."

Present at the meeting were Wang Zhaohua, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Zhang Shijie, Deputy Director of the First Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among others.

　　中尼两国应互相支持共同富强
    新华社12日讯　陈毅副总理在今天下午接见了尼泊尔青年和学生组织代表克·普·什雷斯塔、姆·耳·什雷斯塔、德·尔·达克瓦、普·尔·什拉琴德、格·恩·斯·达瓦迪等五位朋友。
    在接见的时候，陈毅副总理同尼泊尔的青年朋友们进行了亲切友好的谈话。他对最近中尼边界发生的不幸的偶然事件表示歉意，并且感谢柯伊拉腊首相在处理这个事件时采取的友好态度。尼泊尔青年联合会副主席克·普·什雷斯塔说，他希望不会因为不幸的边界事件这件小事的发生而影响尼中两国千年友好的传统友谊。陈毅副总理说，中国和尼泊尔应该友好相处，因为我们两国之间没有根本利益的冲突。亚非国家之间都没有根本利益的冲突，我们都是朋友，应该友好相处。
    陈毅副总理还说，中国和尼泊尔面临着共同的任务，我们两国的经济都还落后，都需要建设现代化的工业，开发丰富的资源，提高人民的物质生活水平，我们应该互相支持和帮助，并且长期地友好合作。
    克·普·什雷斯塔代表尼泊尔青年、学生和人民对中国给尼泊尔的经济援助表示衷心的感谢。陈毅副总理说，中国给尼泊尔的援助是很微薄的。我们两国是互相援助互相支持的。尼泊尔政府和人民承认中华人民共和国，并且主张恢复我国在联合国的合法地位，就是对我们的支持。我们对此表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理说，我们希望看到尼泊尔更加富强起来，我们希望看到亚非各国都更加富强起来，你们的富强就是对我们的支持，同样，我们的富强也是对亚非各国的支持。我们之间没有嫉妒，因为只有我们大家互相支持，共同富强起来，我们才能粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策。
    尼泊尔青年组织全国执行委员会委员德·尔·达克瓦谈到了访问中国的观感。他说，他们在中国到处都看到了工农业大跃进的情况，中国的建设事业每天都在发生新的变化。他说：“我们发现中国人民对尼泊尔人民有着深厚的友谊，中国人民愿意同尼泊尔人民友好。”他还转达了柯伊拉腊首相对中国人民的友好祝愿。尼泊尔青年联盟代表姆·耳·什雷斯塔说：“尼中两国人民在过去千年都是友好的，我们的友谊是任何事情也破坏不了的，它将像联系我们两国的喜马拉雅山那样长存。”陈毅副总理请尼泊尔青年代表转致中国人民对柯伊拉腊首相和尼泊尔人民的问候，他说：“我们两国人民将千年万年地友好下去。我们的友谊是经得起时间的考验的。”
