    Leading Cadres of the Liulihe Cement Plant Merge with Workers in Production and Life
    Problems are Discussed Together, Difficulties are Overcome Together
    Workers praised: Our leading cadres are promoters of the Great Leap Forward. It is extremely pleasant to work with such cadres. The era of the Great Leap Forward needs such leaders.
    (Reported by our newspaper) The production of the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant has been rising steadily. In the first six months of this year, the cement output exceeded the state plan for the first half of the year by 29.66%, and increased by 29.1% compared with the same period last year. All indicators such as output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and total output value have also exceeded the plan every month, and safe production has been achieved. The excellent production situation of this plant is closely related to the working style of the leading cadres in contacting the masses and going deep into reality. The workers are satisfied and praised their leading cadres as promoters of the Great Leap Forward and good leaders of the workers.
    Here it is impossible to distinguish who are the leading cadres and who are the workers
    When we visited this factory, Li Wenrui, the secretary of the Party committee, was working with the unloading workers to install electric shovels under the scorching sun in the raw material unloading yard. In the factory building where the raw material mill was being installed, the electric welding sparks were dazzling, and the workers were sweating profusely. Yang Shenxuan, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, with a towel around his neck to wipe sweat, was both directing and laboring. In the finished product workshop, the last process in cement production, the Party branch secretary and workshop director walked from one mill to another, calculating the cement output with the workers. At the raw material base, the mine, which is fifteen kilometers away from the factory, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, Zong Benmu, and the Party branch secretaries and workshop directors of the workshops take turns sitting in the command post day and night, and trains loaded with limestone are constantly heading to the factory from here... The entire factory presents a vivid picture of unity from top to bottom, enthusiastically striving for high production.
    The thorough and down-to-earth style of the leading cadres of the Liulihe Cement Plant is full of the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. The workers told reporters many vivid facts they had personally experienced.
    Leadership style in the era of the Great Leap Forward
    In March of this year, the factory expanded its factory buildings, replaced equipment, and had to dismantle the cement mill that was producing in the open air. At that time, some people believed that it was "a matter of course" to reduce cement production because the dismantling of some equipment and suspension of production to make way for expansion had been approved by the state. Some people disagreed. They said that the country was undergoing large-scale construction, and cement was needed everywhere. We should squeeze out one more ton if we can. They advocated that the mill should be dismantled for expansion, but after dismantling, it should be moved to another place for continued production. The Party committee secretary and factory directors went to the grassroots cadres and workers, organized everyone to speak out and debate, and also held individual talks in the canteen and workers' dormitories. The ideological understanding quickly became consistent. Immediately afterward, the Party committee secretary led technical cadres and relevant personnel to inspect the terrain overnight, organized a shock team, clarified the division of labor, and made a detailed plan for moving the mill. Under the leadership of Yang Shenxuan, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, they quickly went into battle. In just seven days, a cement mill was moved from the south end of the factory building to the north end and continued production, resulting in an additional 24,000 tons of cement produced in the first quarter of this year compared with the fourth quarter of last year, exceeding the first quarter plan. The workers said very excitedly: "When the leading cadres are around, we discuss problems and solve difficulties. There is no buck-passing at all. We are full of energy when we work. It is extremely pleasant. The era of the Great Leap Forward needs such leaders."
    Humbly listen to various opinions and care about various problems among the masses
    In the process of working together with the workers and jointly studying and solving problems, the leading cadres of the Liulihe Cement Plant humbly listened to the various voices of the masses and cared about the various problems in the Great Leap Forward. During the night shift when they worked with the workers, they heard many workers say that they did not get enough rest during the night shift, which affected production. These opinions of the workers quickly became the agenda of the Party committee meeting. The Party committee decided to break the past practice and quickly adjusted the time of the three shifts of production throughout the factory, pushing back the start time of each shift by two hours. This measure was warmly welcomed by the vast number of employees.
    Four basic experiences
    In the practice of the past few years, the leading cadres of this factory have deeply realized that going deep into the reality of production, relying on the masses of workers, and working conscientiously with full revolutionary enthusiasm are important guarantees for implementing the Party's general line for building socialism and promoting the continuous leap forward in production. Their excellent work style in leading production is formed on the basis of this idea. Their basic experiences are:
    First, resolutely walk out of the office, out of the conference room, to production, to the masses, constantly talk to the masses about the situation and tasks, constantly discover problems and solve problems, and closely combine the strength of the leadership and the masses. The leaders here understand this truth very well: Problems occur in the workshops and on the site, not in the office. Leading production without going to the site is not effective at all.
    Second, work with the highest standards and requirements. After setting high goals, give full play to subjective initiative, find and mobilize various positive factors, tap every bit of potential, and guide the masses to complete ahead of schedule with tenacious revolutionary will.
    Third, grasp production tightly and ruthlessly, from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, from morning to night, without relaxing for a moment or a second. The factory-level leaders grasp it once a day, the workshop grasps it once a shift, and the workers grasp it by the hour and by the minute.
    Fourth, the leading cadres in life and workers together, the same dining room for dinner, the same residential area to live, together for cultural and sports activities, completely in the guise of an ordinary worker. They often go to the workers' homes to chat, visit the canteen and nurseries, from all sides to care about the lives of workers. Thus, the workers felt that the leading cadres are approachable and amiable, and each other became close friends, what opinions, requests, difficulties are reflected to the leadership, so the top and bottom a heart, something everyone discussed everyone do.

    琉璃河水泥厂领导干部从生产到生活和工人打成一片
    有问题共同商量  有困难共同克服
    工人称赞说：我们的领导干部是大跃进的促进派，和这样的干部在一起干活痛快极了，大跃进的时代就需要这样的领导。
    本报讯　北京琉璃河水泥厂的生产节节上升，今年前六个月的水泥产量超过上半年国家计划29.66％，比去年同期增长了29.1％，产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率和生产总值等各项指标，也都月月超额完成计划，并做到了安全生产。这个厂的生产情况这样好，同领导干部联系群众深入实际的作风有着密切的关系。工人们都满意地称赞他们的领导干部是大跃进的促进派，工人的好领导。
    在这里分不清谁是领导干部谁是工人
    我们访问这个工厂的时候，在原料卸车场上，党委书记李文瑞在烈日曝晒下正和卸车工人一起安装电铲。在安装生料磨的厂房中，电焊火花耀人眼目，工人个个挥汗如雨，党委副书记杨慎选，脖子上系着一条擦汗的毛巾，既指挥，又劳动。在生产水泥最后一道工序的制成车间，党支部书记、车间主任从这台磨走到那台磨，和工人们一道计算着水泥的产量。在远离工厂十五公里的原料基地——矿山上，党委副书记宗本木和车间的党支部书记、车间主任，日夜三班轮流坐镇指挥生产，满载石灰石的火车，不停地从这里向工厂驶去……全厂呈现出一幅上下一条心，热情夺高产的生动图景。
    琉璃河水泥厂领导干部深入踏实的作风，充满了大跃进的精神。工人们向记者讲述了他们亲身经历的很多生动事实。
    大跃进时代的领导作风
    今年3月，这个工厂扩建厂房，改换设备，要把在露天生产的水泥磨拆除。当时有人认为部分设备拆除停产给扩建让路，是国家批准的，减少水泥产量是“理所当然”。有人不同意这样做，他们说，国家大建设，到处需要水泥，咱们能多挤一吨就多挤一吨，他们主张进行扩建磨要拆，拆后要搬到别的地方继续进行生产。党委书记和厂长们分别到基层干部和工人中去，组织大家鸣放辩论，在食堂、工人宿舍也进行个别交谈，思想认识很快趋于一致。紧接着党委书记带领技术干部和有关人员，连夜察看了地形，组织了突击队，明确分工，做出了详细的搬磨计划，在党委副书记杨慎选率领下，迅速投入了战斗。仅仅七天时间，就把一台水泥磨从厂房南头搬到北头，继续生产，使今年第一季度比去年第四季度多生产了两万四千多吨水泥，超额完成了第一季度计划。工人非常兴奋地说：“领导干部在跟前，有问题就商量，有困难就解决，一点也不扯皮，干起活来浑身是劲，痛快极了，大跃进的时代就需要这样的领导。”
    虚心倾听各种意见关心群众中的各种问题
    在和工人共同劳动，共同研究解决问题的过程中，琉璃河水泥厂的领导干部，虚心地听取群众的各种呼声，关心着大跃进中的各种问题。他们在夜班和工人一起劳动中，听到很多工人说夜班休息不好，影响生产。工人的这些意见，很快成为党委会的议事日程，党委决定打破历年惯例，很快调整了全厂三班生产的时间，每班的上班时间都后推两小时。这一措施受到广大职工的热烈欢迎。
    四条基本经验
    这个厂的领导干部在几年来的实践中深刻地体会到，深入生产实际，依靠职工群众，以满腔的革命热情踏踏实实地进行工作，是贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，促使生产持续跃进的重要保证。他们在领导生产中的优良作风，就是在这种思想基础上形成的。他们的基本经验是：
    第一，坚决地走出办公室，走出会议室，到生产中去，到群众中去，不断地向群众讲形势，讲任务，不断地发现问题和解决问题，把领导和群众的力量紧紧结合在一起。这里的领导很懂得这个道理：问题都发生在车间、现场，不发生在办公室，领导生产不到现场根本不灵。
    第二，以最高的标准和要求进行工作。提出高目标之后，充分发挥主观能动性，寻找和调动各种积极因素，挖掘一点一滴的潜力，以顽强的革命毅力，引导群众提前超额完成。
    第三，对生产抓得紧，抓得狠，从月初到月末，从早晨到夜晚，一时一刻、一分一秒也不放松。厂一级领导一天一抓，车间一班一抓，工人则一点钟，一分钟地抓。
    第四，领导干部在生活上和工人打成一片，同一个食堂吃饭，同宿舍区住家，一起进行文化体育活动，完全以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。他们经常到工人家里串门，访问食堂和托儿所，从各方面关心职工生活。这样工人感到领导干部平易近人，和蔼可亲，互相间成了知心朋友，有什么意见、要求、困难都向领导反映，因此上下一条心，有事大家商量大家干。
