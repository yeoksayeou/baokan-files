    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council recently held a meeting in Stockholm to discuss major issues related to world peace and adopted a general declaration and various resolutions. This meeting made new contributions to the cause of people of all countries in opposing imperialism and defending world peace. We warmly congratulate the success of the meeting.
    The Stockholm meeting was held under an unprecedentedly favorable international situation. In the recent period, the struggles of the people of all countries against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace have achieved a series of new and great victories. The crimes of U.S. imperialism in infringing upon the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Government Summit have thoroughly exposed its warmongering and aggressive nature, placing it in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the face of the people of the world. The solemn struggle of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries against U.S. imperialist aggression and provocations has powerfully defended world peace and greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of the world for peace. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward and continuously achieving victories. In particular, the patriotic and just struggles of the people in Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. At the same time, the struggles of the people of Western countries, including the American people, for peace and democracy are also developing extensively. The general declaration and various resolutions adopted by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, as well as the speeches of representatives from various countries, reflect the firm confidence of the people of all countries in defending world peace and the high fighting will to continue to oppose imperialist aggression and war policies.
    On the one hand, this meeting pointed out to the people of the world the bright prospects for striving for world peace, giving people confidence and courage, and not being intimidated by the imperialist threat of war; at the same time, it also called on the people of the world to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the danger of imperialism launching a war. Countless facts prove that the aggressive imperialism has not learned a lesson from its series of failures. In particular, U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of world peace, after sabotaging the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, once again sent an RB-47 reconnaissance bomber to invade Soviet airspace, conducted rocket and atomic mock-bombing exercises in South Korea, and massively increased the number of U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" personnel in South Vietnam, stepping up war preparations. While carrying out provocative and destructive activities against socialist countries, U.S. imperialism is stepping up economic pressure on Cuba and plotting armed intervention; on the other hand, it is fully supporting the Belgian colonialists in their aggression against the newly independent Congo, attempting to directly control the Congo, an important supplier of U.S. strategic resources. During this period, representatives of the U.S. ruling clique have also continuously issued war cries, even openly advocating "preemptive" war. All these show that the U.S. imperialist war policy and aggression policy have not changed in the slightest, and it is constantly escalating international tensions and is ready to take new adventures at any time. This cannot but arouse the serious attention of the people of the world.
    The Stockholm Conference's general declaration pointed out: "The people of the world are increasingly understanding who is the enemy of peace. In order to defeat their attempts, the world peace movement must intensify the struggle more powerfully than ever before. In order to carry out this struggle, all peace forces in the world must maintain and develop the closest unity and cooperation." The point raised in the general declaration is of great significance. The people of the world have increasingly clearly realized that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious, craziest, and armed-to-the-teeth enemy of world peace, and they must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about it. In particular, as the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of "fake peace and real war preparations" is constantly exposed, the people of the world have received profound negative education time and time again, and more and more people understand that the achievement of world peace cannot rely on begging, but must mainly rely on the struggle of the people of all countries. Only by persistently carrying out tit-for-tat struggles against U.S. imperialism and further strengthening unity and mutual support in the struggle can the most powerful force be concentrated, and can the main enemy of world peace be continuously defeated and the cause of world peace be firmly grasped in their own hands.
    The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are one of the important forces for defeating imperialist war forces. The vigorous development of this movement has greatly influenced and promoted the world peace movement. Precisely because of this, imperialism has been carrying out increasingly frantic suppression of the national democratic movements in various countries. Recently, U.S. imperialism has been eager to strangle the newborn Cuba and Congo, which is the most obvious example. The Stockholm Conference pointed out in its adopted resolution that the U.S. government's policy towards Cuba is a threat to the people of the Americas and the Cuban people. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council supports the firm attitude of the Cuban government and people in defending their sovereignty, independence, and right to self-determination, strongly condemns U.S. imperialist aggression against Cuba, and calls on the people of all countries to unite with Cuba to resist U.S. imperialist pressure and threats. The Stockholm Conference firmly supports the Congolese people's struggle to maintain independence, condemns the Belgian colonialists' acts of aggression against the Congo, and demands that no more troops be sent to the Congo, that all troops already in the Congo be withdrawn, that all foreign military bases in the Congo be abolished, and expresses that the World Peace Council will use its united strength to fight for the maintenance of Congo's independence. At present, Belgian colonialists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are expanding their aggression and bloody suppression against the Congo, and U.S. imperialism is also colluding with Belgian colonialism, conspiring to carry out further intervention and infiltration in the Congo, which cannot but arouse the anger of the people of the world. Socialist countries and peace-loving and justice-upholding people of all countries are taking action to resolutely stop all foreign interventionists' attempts to strangle the newborn Republic of the Congo. The meeting gave high praise to the Japanese people's anti-American and patriotic just struggle, believing that this struggle is not only unprecedented in Japanese history, but also greatly encouraged the cause of world peace and the struggle against aggression. The victory of the Japanese people is the victory of peace-loving people all over the world (including the majority of the American people who desire peace); and it stated that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council will do everything possible to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle for the final abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The general declaration of the Stockholm Conference also pointed out: "The events that have recently occurred in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan should become an example for all of us." At the same time, the representatives of Asian and African countries participating in the meeting also held a special meeting and unanimously adopted a declaration, warmly supporting the struggles of the people of Japan, Turkey, South Korea, South Vietnam, Algeria, Congo, Tunisia, Morocco, Kenya, Zanzibar, Cuba, and other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, and called on the people of Asian and African countries to be vigilant and smash the imperialist plots of division. Undoubtedly, this declaration is a powerful encouragement for all oppressed nations to strive for independence. The further development of the national independence movement, turning more colonies and semi-colonies from the rear of imperialism into the front line, will inevitably greatly weaken the strength of imperialism and greatly enhance the strength to defend world peace.
    The general declaration of the Stockholm Conference pointed out that the current goals of the people of all countries in striving for peace are to hold a broad disarmament conference with the participation of all countries, to ban the testing of all nuclear weapons, to ban the flight of all aircraft carrying nuclear weapons, to dismantle all military bases in foreign countries, to abolish all military treaties, etc. The socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have consistently advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and have consistently made unremitting efforts to achieve universal disarmament. However, facts have repeatedly proved that the imperialist countries headed by the United States are hindering the realization of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and the imperialist countries headed by the United States are also not sincere in disarmament. Therefore, only by relying on the continuously growing united force of the socialist camp, the national democratic movement, and the peace-loving people of the world, persistently carrying out a long-term struggle against imperialism, can it be possible to prevent U.S. imperialism from turning the "cold war" into a hot war, can it be possible to force the imperialist countries to sit down and seriously negotiate and reach certain agreements on the issue of disarmament, and can it be possible to force the imperialist countries to accept the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems to varying degrees.
    The Chinese people love peace. The Chinese people have always joined the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and the peace-loving people of the world in making unremitting efforts to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for world peace. Comrade Liao Chengzhi, head of our country's delegation to the meeting, explained in detail in his speech the consistent efforts made by the Chinese people to strive for world peace and our various propositions for maintaining world peace. This speech was praised and supported by the representatives of various countries attending the meeting. We firmly believe that, faced with the current excellent situation for the world peace movement, as long as the people of all countries can forge the broadest international united

    团结，斗争，争取世界和平
    最近，世界和平理事会常务委员会在斯德哥尔摩举行会议，讨论了有关世界和平的一些重大问题，并且通过了总宣言和各项决议。这次会议为世界各国人民反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的事业作出了新的贡献。我们热烈祝贺会议的成功。
    斯德哥尔摩会议是在空前有利的国际形势下举行的。最近一个时期来，各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争取得了一系列新的伟大胜利，美帝国主义侵犯苏联和破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪行，彻底暴露了它的好战和侵略的本质，使它在全世界人民面前陷于空前孤立的地位。苏联和其他社会主义国家反对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅的严正斗争，有力地捍卫了世界和平，极大地鼓舞了全世界人民争取和平的斗争。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族民主运动风起云涌，并且接连不断地取得胜利。特别是日本、南朝鲜和土耳其等国人民的爱国正义斗争，给予美帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。同时，西方各国人民包括美国人民争取和平和民主的斗争也在广泛地发展。这次世界和平理事会常务委员会所通过的总宣言和各项决议以及各国代表的发言，反映了各国人民保卫世界和平的坚强信心，和再接再厉地反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的高昂斗争意志。
    这次会议一方面向全世界人民指出了争取世界和平的光明前景，使人们得到信心和勇气，不为帝国主义的战争威胁所吓倒；同时也号召全世界人民对帝国主义发动战争的危险必须保持高度的警惕。无数的事实证明，侵略成性的帝国主义并未从自己一系列的失败中取得教训。特别是世界和平的头号敌人美帝国主义，继破坏了十国裁军会议之后，又一次派遣RB—47型侦察轰炸机侵犯苏联领空，在南朝鲜进行火箭和原子模拟弹射击演习，在南越大量增加美国“军事援助顾问团”的人员，加紧备战活动。在对社会主义国家进行挑衅和破坏活动的同时，美帝国主义正一面加紧对古巴施行经济压力，并且阴谋策划武装干涉；一面在非洲全力支持比利时殖民者侵略刚刚独立的刚果，企图直接控制刚果这一美国战略资源的重要供应地。在这一期间，美国统治集团的代表人物还不断发出战争叫嚣，甚至公然鼓吹“先发制人”的战争。所有这些，都说明美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策丝毫未变，它正在不断地加剧国际紧张局势，随时准备进行新的冒险。这不能不引起全世界人民的严重注意。
    斯德哥尔摩会议总宣言指出：“世界人民越来越懂得谁是和平的敌人。为了击败他们的企图，世界和平运动必须比以往更加有力地加紧进行斗争。为了进行这个斗争，世界上所有的和平力量必须保持和发展最密切的团结和合作。”总宣言提出的这一点，是有重要意义的。全世界人民已经越来越清楚地认识到美国帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶、最疯狂、武装到牙齿的敌人，决不能对它怀抱任何不切实际的幻想。特别是随着美帝国主义“假和平、真备战”的阴谋不断被揭露，全世界人民一次又一次地受到了深刻的反面教育，越来越多的人懂得了世界和平的取得不能依靠乞求，而必须主要地依靠各国人民的斗争。全世界人民只有坚持不懈地同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，并在斗争中进一步加强团结，互相支持，才能集中最强大的力量，才能不断地击败世界和平的主要敌人，把世界和平的事业牢牢地掌握在自己手中。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，是击败帝国主义战争势力的重要力量之一，这一运动的蓬勃发展，大大影响和推动了世界和平运动。正因为如此，帝国主义对各国民族民主运动一直进行越来越疯狂的镇压。最近，美帝国主义迫不及待地要扼杀新生的古巴和刚果，就是最明显的事例。斯德哥尔摩会议在它通过的决议中指出，美国政府对古巴的政策是对美洲人民以及古巴人民的威胁，世界和平理事会常委会支持古巴政府和人民保卫他们的主权、独立和自决权的坚定态度，强有力地谴责美帝国主义对古巴的侵略，并号召各国人民同古巴团结一致，抵抗美帝国主义的压力和威胁。斯德哥尔摩会议坚决支持刚果人民维护独立的斗争，谴责比利时殖民者对刚果的侵略行为，并要求停止再派遣军队到刚果，撤退一切已在刚果的军队，取消在刚果的一切外国军事基地，并表示世界和平理事会将用它的联合一致的力量为维护刚果的独立而斗争。目前，比利时殖民者在美帝国主义支持下正在扩大它对刚果的侵略和血腥镇压，而美帝国主义也勾结比利时殖民主义者，阴谋策划对刚果实行进一步的干涉和渗入，这不能不引起全世界人民的愤怒。社会主义国家和爱好和平、主持正义的各国人民正在行动起来，坚决制止一切外国干涉者企图扼杀新生的刚果共和国的阴谋。会议对日本人民的反美爱国的正义斗争给予很高的评价，认为这种斗争不仅在日本历史上是空前的，而且也大大鼓舞了世界和平事业和反对侵略的斗争，日本人民的胜利是全世界爱好和平人民（包括切望和平的大多数美国人民）的胜利；并且表示，世界和平理事会常委会将尽一切努力支持日本人民为最后废除日美军事同盟条约而进行的爱国正义斗争。斯德哥尔摩会议的总宣言并且指出：“最近在南朝鲜、土耳其和日本发生的事件应当成为我们大家的榜样。”同时，参加这次会议的亚非国家代表还专门举行会议，一致通过宣言，热情地支持日本、土耳其、南朝鲜、南越、阿尔及利亚、刚果、突尼斯、摩洛哥、怯尼亚、桑给巴尔、古巴以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲其他国家人民为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而进行的一切斗争，并且号召亚非各国人民提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义的分裂阴谋。无疑的，这个宣言，是对于一切被压迫民族争取独立的有力鼓舞。民族独立运动的进一步发展，把更多的殖民地、半殖民地从帝国主义的后方变为前线，势必大大削弱帝国主义的力量，大大增强保卫世界和平的力量。
    斯德哥尔摩会议总宣言中指出，当前各国人民为争取和平而努力的目标是，举行各国参加的广泛的裁军会议、禁止试验一切核武器、禁止一切携带核武器的飞机飞行、撤除一切在外国的军事基地、废除一切军事条约，等等。以苏联为首的社会主义国家一贯主张不同制度的国家和平共处，一贯为实现普遍裁军进行不懈的努力。然而，事实一再证明，阻碍不同社会制度国家的和平共处实现的是以美国为首的帝国主义国家，没有裁军诚意的也是以美国为首的帝国主义国家。因此，只有依靠社会主义阵营、民族民主运动和世界爱好和平人民的不断壮大的联合力量，坚持不懈地同帝国主义进行长期的斗争，才有可能阻止美帝国主义把“冷战”变成热战，才有可能迫使帝国主义国家坐下来认真地谈判，在裁军问题上达成一定的协议，才有可能迫使帝国主义国家在不同程度上接受不同社会制度国家的和平共处。
    中国人民是热爱和平的，中国人民一向同苏联和其他社会主义国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为反对帝国主义侵略、争取世界和平进行不懈的努力。我国出席会议的代表团团长廖承志同志在发言中，详细说明了中国人民为争取世界和平所作的一贯努力以及我们对于维护世界和平的各项主张。这个发言获得了到会各国代表的赞扬和支持。我们深信，面对着目前对世界和平运动的大好形势，只要各国人民能够结成最广泛的国际统一战线，高举起反对帝国主义侵略、争取世界和平的旗帜，同世界和平最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，继续挫败美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，就一定能够赢得保卫世界和平的越来越大的胜利！
