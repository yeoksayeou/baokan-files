    Shandong's Coal Gasification Movement Steadily Improves
    Adhering to self-reliance, promoting advanced experiences, developing from simple use of coal gas to comprehensive utilization. As of the end of May, the province had saved 680,000 tons of coal and more than 7,000 tons of various liquid fuels.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 7th: A mass movement to save coal by utilizing coal gas has been continuously, deeply, and widely carried out throughout Shandong Province. Now, this movement is developing in the direction of consolidation, improvement, and comprehensive utilization.
    Compared to March, the number of coal gas generators built and put into production throughout the province more than tripled by June. The scope of coal gas utilization is becoming wider and wider, and the effects are also greater. From utilization in firing kilns, oil extraction, printing and dyeing cloth, singeing wool, brewing wine, ore roasting, metal forging, heat treatment, burning boilers, iron smelting, and the production of glass, cement, grinding wheels, refractory materials, and calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, it has further developed to using coal gas instead of liquid fuels to power gasoline engines, diesel engines, tractors, and irrigation and drainage machinery; from one furnace for one use to one furnace for multiple uses; from simple utilization of coal gas to tar recovery; from use in production to use in life. Due to the rapid development of the movement, significant achievements have been made in saving resources. As of the end of May, the province had saved 680,000 tons of coal and 7,133 tons of various liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
    Adhering to self-reliance, focusing on indigenous methods, and vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" are important reasons for the success of the coal gasification movement in Shandong. Because this policy was resolutely implemented and the masses were fully mobilized, many new creations emerged in the process of building furnaces. The existing coal gas generators in Shandong Province are all built using indigenous methods. They use much less steel than foreign coal gas furnaces, or even no steel at all, requiring less investment and yielding quick results. Such furnaces can use either mechanical ventilation or natural ventilation; they can be large or small. It is easy to build furnaces and the operation is simple. Factories, streets, people's communes, government agencies, and schools can all build them. They have a very good effect when used. For example, using the coal gas generated by this type of furnace to drive a diesel engine to irrigate farmland costs more than 60% less than using liquid fuel.
    Treating the promotion of advanced experience as a continuous process of popularization and improvement is another characteristic of Shandong's mass movement to utilize coal gas. They adopt a leadership method of promoting, experimenting, popularizing, and improving simultaneously. While extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses, they vigorously organize the "three-way combination" of scientific research departments, universities, and production and user departments, experimenting in promotion, improving in popularization, constantly technically appraising, and theoretically summarizing, so that this major creation in technological innovation continuously develops, improves, and enhances in the process of promotion. Shandong Province's mass movement to utilize coal gas started with firing bricks and tiles and ceramics. After continuous research and experimentation, it quickly spread to all walks of life in a short period of time, and from simply saving coal, it further advanced to saving gasoline and diesel. Currently, it is developing in the direction of comprehensive utilization. The Zibo Water Pump Factory created a simple indigenous coal gas station, changing from one furnace for one use to one furnace for multiple uses, from simple utilization to comprehensive utilization, making the use of coal gas more complete, more reasonable, and more economical. After summarizing and promoting this experience, 50 indigenous coal gas storage stations have now been built throughout the province. The Jinan Glass Factory successfully used self-made indigenous equipment for recovering coal tar and fractionating tar to fractionate 13 products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, phenol, benzene, and asphalt from tar, initially realizing the requirement of turning a coal gas furnace into a small chemical plant. This successful experience has now been implemented on 542 coal gas furnaces, and more than 15,000 tons of coal tar have been recovered.

It can also fractionate 13 kinds of liquid fuels and chemical products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and asphalt from tar. After being promoted throughout the factory, more than 500 tons of tar can be recovered annually. This is an indigenous coal tar fractionation device.

    山东煤气化运动步步提高
    坚持自力更生，推广先进经验，从单纯利用煤气向综合利用发展截至五月底，全省已节约煤炭六十八万吨，各种液体燃料七千多吨。
    据新华社济南7日电　一个利用煤气节省煤炭的群众运动，已经在山东省全省范围内持续、深入、广泛地开展起来。现在，这一运动正向着巩固、提高和综合利用的方向发展。
    以6月同3月相比，全省建成和投入生产的煤气发生炉跃增两倍以上。煤气利用的范围越来越广，效果也越来越大。从烧窑、榨油、印染布、烤毛、酿酒、矿石焙烧、金属锻打、热处理、烧锅炉、化铁以及玻璃、水泥、砂轮、耐火材料、钙镁磷肥的生产等方面的利用，进一步发展到以煤气代替液体燃料发动汽油机、柴油机、拖拉机和排灌机械；从一炉一用发展到一炉多用；从单纯利用煤气发展到焦油回收；从用于生产到用于生活。由于运动的迅速发展，在节约方面取得了显著成绩，截至5月底统计，全省已经节约煤炭六十八万吨，各种汽油、柴油等液体燃料七千一百三十三吨。
    坚持自力更生、以土为主、大搞
  “小土群”，是山东煤气化运动取得成效的重要原因。由于坚决贯彻这一方针，充分发动了群众，因而在建炉过程中出现了许多新的创造。山东省现有的煤气发生炉，都是用土法建成的。它比洋煤气炉少用很多钢材，甚至无需钢材，投资少，收效快。这样的炉子，既可以采用机械通风，也可以自然通风；可以搞大的，也可以搞小的。建炉容易，操作简便，工厂、街道、人民公社、机关、学校都可以建造。它们的使用效果很好，例如用这种炉子发生的煤气带动柴油机灌溉农田，成本比用液体燃料低60％多。
    把推广先进经验作为不断普及和提高的过程，是山东开展利用煤气的群众运动的另一个特点。他们采用边推广、边试验、边普及、边提高的领导方法，在广泛深入发动群众的同时，大力组织科学研究部门、高等院校和生产使用部门三结合，从推广中试验，从普及中提高，不断从技术上鉴定，在理论上总结，使这项技术革新中的重大创造在推广过程中不断发展，不断完善，不断提高。山东省的利用煤气的群众运动，从烧制砖瓦、陶瓷开始，经过不断地研究试验，在短短的时间内就迅速推广到各行各业，并从单纯节约煤炭进而节约汽油、柴油，目前已向综合利用方向发展。淄博水泵厂创造出一座简易土煤气站，由一炉一用变为一炉多用，由单纯利用变成综合利用，使煤气的使用更充分、更合理、更经济。经过总结推广，目前全省已建成土煤气储存站五十座。济南玻璃厂成功地用自制的回收煤焦油和焦油分馏的土设备，从焦油中分馏出汽油、煤油、柴油、酚、苯、沥青等十三种产品，初步实现了一个煤气炉变成一个小化工厂的要求。这项成功的经验，目前已在五百四十二座煤气炉上推行，并已回收煤焦油一万五千多吨。（附图片） 　 济南玻璃厂实现煤气化后，又建成一座土法煤焦油回收和焦油分馏设备，每天可回收煤焦油一百公斤。并能从焦油中分馏出汽油、煤油、柴油、沥青等十三种液体燃料和化工产品。全厂推广后，一年可回收焦油五百多吨。这是土煤焦油分馏设备
