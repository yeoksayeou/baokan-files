　　Let the Sea Offer Up Fertilizer
    The Qingdao Taixi People's Commune, on the basis of vigorously developing chemical "small-scale indigenous groups," launched a mass movement to comprehensively utilize seawater to extract fertilizer from the sea. All members of the commune displayed the same spirit as when they were vigorously developing steel production, and in two days and nights, they built forty-five seawater comprehensive utilization chemical plants, successfully trial-produced twelve kinds of products, and seven of them have already been put into mass production.
    These plants all adopted indigenous methods to get started. If there were no bricks, everyone contributed them; if there were no pots, rice pots were used. The six seawater comprehensive utilization chemical plants in the Yuncheng North Road Management Area quickly extracted three products from seawater: magnesium hydroxide, potassium magnesium fertilizer, and others. The Guanxian Road Management Area learned from the experience of the Yuncheng North Road Management Area and also built thirty-four plants, which have begun producing magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, and other products.
    Now this commune is striving for higher goals with a spirit of continuous revolution. In addition to consolidating the existing "small-scale indigenous group" factories, they are preparing to build four more standardized seawater comprehensive utilization processing plants.

### 让海水献出化肥

　  让海水献出化肥
    青岛台西人民公社，在大搞化工“小土群”的基础上，开展综合利用海水的群众运动，向海水要化肥。这个社的所有社员，拿出了大办钢铁的劲头，两昼夜就建起了海水综合利用化工厂四十五个，试制成功十二种产品，并有七种已经大量投入生产。
    这些厂都是采用土办法先上马，没有砖，大家献，没有锅，用饭锅。郓城北路管理区的六个综合利用海水的化工厂，很快从海水中提取了氢氧化镁、钾镁肥等三种产品。冠县路管理区，学习了郓城北路管理区的经验，也建起了三十四个厂，已开始生产氯化镁、氯化钾、硫酸钠等产品。
    现在这个公社正以不断革命的精神向更高的方向努力。他们除了巩固现有的“小土群”工厂外，准备再建立四个定型的海水综合利用加工厂。
