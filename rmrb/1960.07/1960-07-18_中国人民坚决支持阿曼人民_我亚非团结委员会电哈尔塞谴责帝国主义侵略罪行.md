　　The Chinese People Firmly Support the People of Oman
　　China's Asian-African Solidarity Committee Cables al-Harsy Condemning Imperialist Crimes of Aggression
Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee sent a cable to al-Harsy, Deputy Imam of Oman, today on the occasion of "Oman Day," expressing heartfelt admiration and respect to the heroic and unyielding people of Oman.

The cable from the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee stated that the people of Oman have waged a long and tenacious struggle against British aggression and for national independence and freedom. In particular, since the large-scale armed uprising launched in 1957, the fighting spirit of the Omani people has become even more vigorous, and the struggle is expanding to all parts of the country, constantly dealing heavy blows to imperialism. The just struggle of the Omani people has received the sympathy and support of the Asian and African people and all peace-loving and just forces in the world. The Chinese people strongly condemn the imperialist aggression against Oman and the barbaric crimes of slaughtering the Omani people, and express firm support for the Omani people's struggle against imperialism and for independence and freedom.

The cable said: "The struggle of the Omani people is not isolated. Today, the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America is rising to an unprecedented height, and the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is in a very isolated and passive position. This situation is very beneficial to the struggle of the Omani people against aggression and for independence. We firmly believe that as long as the heroic Omani people strengthen their unity, continue to persist in the struggle, and remain vigilant against all kinds of conspiracies by imperialism headed by the United States, they will surely be able to realize their national aspirations for independence and freedom."

　　中国人民坚决支持阿曼人民
　　我亚非团结委员会电哈尔塞谴责帝国主义侵略罪行
    新华社17日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天就举行“阿曼日”致电阿曼副教长哈尔塞，向英勇不屈的阿曼人民表示衷心的钦佩和敬意。
    中国亚非团结委员会的电报说，阿曼人民为了反对英国的侵略、争取民族独立和自由，进行了长期顽强的斗争，特别是1957年发动大规模武装起义以来，阿曼人民的斗志更加昂扬，斗争正扩展到全国各地，不断给予帝国主义以沉重的打击。阿曼人民的正义斗争得到了亚非人民和全世界和平与正义力量的同情和支持。中国人民严厉谴责帝国主义侵略阿曼和对阿曼人民进行野蛮屠杀的横暴罪行，并对阿曼人民反对帝国主义、争取独立自由的斗争表示坚决的支持。
    电报说：“阿曼人民的斗争不是孤立的。现在，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族民主运动空前高涨，以美国为首的帝国主义集团陷于非常孤立和被动的境地，这种局面对阿曼人民反抗侵略争取独立的斗争十分有利。我们坚信，只要英勇的阿曼人民加强团结、继续坚持斗争，并警惕以美国为首的帝国主义的各种阴谋，就必然能够实现独立与自由的民族愿望。”
