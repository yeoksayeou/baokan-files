The issue of the Party's work style has always been an extremely important one in Party building. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has, in the long history of revolutionary struggle over the past thirty-nine years, formed a set of fine Marxist-Leninist work styles, which Comrade Mao Zedong summarized in his report "On Coalition Government" as "a work style of integrating theory with practice, a work style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and a work style of self-criticism." Comrade Mao Zedong's work style is precisely this kind of work style and is a model for the entire Party to learn from. The Party's fine work style has played a great role in the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction.

The work style of integrating theory with practice is also the work style of seeking truth from facts that the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have consistently adhered to. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, the laws, and 'seeking' is our effort to study." This means that we must proceed from reality, strive to investigate and study, find out the laws inherent in objective things that do not shift according to people's will, and formulate lines, guidelines, policies, and plans based on these laws. We must strive to make our work conform to objective reality, and we must not act based on imagination, feelings, dead book knowledge, or subjective wishes. This is the concrete embodiment of the dialectical and historical materialism worldview stipulated in our Party's program, and it is the basic requirement of Marxist-Leninist epistemology. At the same time, all our theories, lines, guidelines, policies, and plans must be put into practice so that they produce practical results, and must not be reduced to empty talk or mere formalities. This is because the historical mission of us Communists is not only to correctly interpret the world, but more importantly, to transform the world.

Whether it is to understand, grasp, and apply objective laws, transform the subjective world, and make the subjective conform to the objective, or to turn theory into reality, implement lines and policies, and transform the objective world, all require a process of practice, and cannot be completed at once as metaphysicians imagine. The process of practice is also the process of "from the masses, to the masses," a process of constantly deepening and perfecting one's understanding, moving from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. This requires us to have a work style of maintaining close ties with the people, constantly caring about the hardships of the people's lives, being "willing oxen for the children," and a work style of daring to examine and correct shortcomings and mistakes through self-criticism. As long as we have this kind of work style, we will surely be able to approach and grasp the truth step by step, make our work more and more meticulous, more and more in line with reality, and make greater contributions to the people.

Under the long-term education of Mao Zedong Thought, and through years of struggle, the vast number of Party members and cadres in our Heilongjiang Province have carried forward the Party's traditional fine work style, and have achieved great successes in their work. However, not all cadres have established this work style yet. Some comrades still have this or that shortcoming. Some only pay attention to trivial matters in front of them and lack the lofty ideals of communism, thus their work lacks direction. Some have great ideals and high enthusiasm, which is of course very good, but they are satisfied with general appeals and lack in-depth and specific organizational work, thus their work lacks practical effect. Some act solely on subjective wishes and lack a calm mind, failing to study objective laws in a truth-seeking manner, and their work still has a considerable degree of blindness. Some only pay attention to the momentum of the movement and not to the actual results. Some do not go deep into reality and among the masses enough. Therefore, we must further establish such a fine work style universally in Party organizations throughout the province: we must have both the ambition and lofty ideals of communism, and be farsighted, and we must also seek truth from facts and proceed from reality; we must dare to think and act, and also analyze scientifically; we must be both vigorous and down-to-earth; we must pay attention to both the big picture and the practical details; strive for practical results and avoid seeking empty fame; maintain close ties with the masses, care about the people's lives, improve work methods, constantly overcome shortcomings, further promote the Party's fine traditions, and better and more comprehensively implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, so that our cause will continue to achieve even greater victories.

    发扬党的优良作风
    中共黑龙江省委第一书记　欧阳钦
    党的作风问题从来是党的建设中的极其重要的问题。在毛泽东同志的英明领导下，我们党在过去三十九年的长期革命斗争历史中，已经形成了一套马克思列宁主义的优良作风，这就是毛泽东同志在《论联合政府》的报告中所总结的“理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风”。毛泽东同志的作风就是这种作风，是全党学习的典范。党的优良作风对中国革命与建设事业的胜利起了伟大的作用。
    理论和实践相结合的作风，也就是党和毛泽东同志一贯坚持的实事求是的作风。毛泽东同志说过：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”这就是说，我们必须从实际出发，努力调查研究，找出客观事物所固有的，不以人们的意志为转移的规律性，据以制定路线、方针、政策和规划，力求我们的工作符合客观实际，而不能凭想像、感想、死的书本知识和主观愿望办事。这是我们党的纲领中所规定的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义世界观的具体体现，是马克思列宁主义认识论的基本要求。同时，我们的一切理论、路线、方针、政策、规划都必须付诸实践，使它产生实际结果，而不能流于空谈，变成具文。这是因为我们共产党人的历史使命不只是要正确地解释世界，更重要的是要改造世界。
    不论认识、掌握和运用客观规律性，改造主观世界，使主观符合客观，或者把理论变为现实，把路线、政策付诸实现，改造客观世界，都需要一个实践的过程，而不是像形而上学者所设想的那样可以一次完成。实践的过程也就是“从群众中来，到群众中去”的过程，是不断加深与完善自己的认识由必然的王国进入自由的王国的过程，这就要求我们必须有和人民群众紧密地联系在一起、经常关心人民群众生活疾苦，“俯首甘为孺子牛”的作风和勇于检查改正缺点错误的自我批评的作风。只要有了这种作风，我们就一定可以一步一步接近和掌握真理，使工作愈作愈细，愈作愈合乎实际，对人民作出更大的贡献。
    在毛泽东思想的长期教育下，经过多年来斗争的锻炼，我们黑龙江省的广大党员和干部发扬了党的传统的优良作风，使工作取得了巨大的成就。但是还不是所有的干部都已经树立了这种作风，有些同志还有这样或那样的缺点，有的只注意眼前的微末小事，而缺乏共产主义的远大理想，因而工作茫无方向，有的理想很大，热情很高，这当然是很好的，但满足于一般号召，缺乏深入具体的组织工作，因而工作缺乏实效。有的单凭主观愿望办事，而缺乏冷静的头脑，不注意实事求是地研究客观的规律性，工作还有相当大的盲目性。有的只注意运动的声势，不注意实际的效果。有的深入实际、深入群众较差。因此，我们要在全省党组织中进一步普遍树立这样的优良作风：既要有共产主义的雄心大志，高瞻远瞩，又要实事求是，从实际出发；既要敢想敢干，又要科学分析；既要轰轰烈烈，又要踏踏实实，既要务虚，又要求实；力求实效，不务虚名；密切联系群众，关心人民生活，改进工作方法，不断克服缺点，进一步发扬党的优良传统，更好更全面地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，使我们的事业不断地取得更大的胜利。
