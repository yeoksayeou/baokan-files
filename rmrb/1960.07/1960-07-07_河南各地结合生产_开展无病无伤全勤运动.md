Henan Province Combines Production to Launch "No Illness, No Injury, Full Attendance" Campaign

    (By Our Newspaper) Since the beginning of summer, various regions of Henan Province have widely and deeply launched the patriotic health campaign of "no illness, no injury, full attendance." Currently, some production brigades in Tanghe, Deng County, Runan, Song County, and many government offices, schools, factories, and enterprises have preliminarily reached the standards of "no illness, no injury, full attendance."

    The "no illness, no injury, full attendance" campaign is a new development in combining production with large-scale patriotic health movements. Its main characteristics are: first, to do a good job in the sanitation of all collective production and collective living places such as fields, construction sites, factories and mines, canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, so that sanitation work can serve production more directly and effectively; at the same time, it also promotes the rapid development of the patriotic health movement towards high quality and large areas. Thus, the purpose of better guaranteeing the health of the labor force and promoting production development is achieved.

    This movement was launched by various regions in the spirit of continuous revolution, based on summarizing the experience of the previous stage of the patriotic health movement and according to the current production situation and task requirements of Henan Province. For example, the Chongyi People's Commune Party Committee in Qinyang County, on the basis of summarizing experience, improving organizations, and further mobilizing the masses, uniformly deployed, unified time, and started simultaneously, carrying out large-scale concentrated movements such as killing flies and maggots and improving canteen hygiene. This greatly reduced the number of flies and maggots in the entire commune, and ensured clean and hygienic food, basically controlling the occurrence of gastrointestinal infectious diseases. The Shigang People's Commune in Neixiang County, through summarizing the previous stage of work, believed that due to the insufficient combination of concentrated efforts and routine work, the health movement appeared to be tight at times and loose at others, sometimes good and sometimes bad. Therefore, the entire commune launched "Health Day" and "Health Hour" movements, making the patriotic health movement regular and systematic.

    河南各地结合生产
    开展无病无伤全勤运动
    本报讯　入夏以来，河南省各地广泛深入地开展了无病、无伤、全勤爱国卫生运动。目前，唐河、邓县、汝南、嵩县等县的一部分生产大队和不少机关、学校、工厂企业，已经初步地达到了无病、无伤、全勤的标准。
    无病、无伤、全勤运动，是结合生产，大搞爱国卫生运动的一个新发展。它的主要特点是：首先做好田间、工地、厂矿企业、食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等一切集体生产和集体生活场所的卫生工作，使卫生工作更直接、更有效地为生产服务；同时，也促使爱国卫生运动向着高质量、大面积的方向迅速发展。从而，达到更好地保障劳动大军身体健康、促进生产发展的目的。
    这一运动是各地在总结前段爱国卫生运动经验的基础上，根据河南省当前生产形势和任务要求，以不断革命的精神开展起来的。如沁阳县崇义人民公社党委，在总结经验、健全组织、进一步发动群众的基础上，统一布置，统一时间，一齐动手，大规模地开展了捕杀蝇蛆和食堂卫生等单项突击运动。使全社蝇、蛆大大减少，饮食清洁卫生，基本上控制了肠胃传染病的发生。内乡县师岗人民公社，通过总结前段工作，认为由于突击与经常结合不够，致使卫生运动出现时紧时松、时好时坏的现象，于是全公社开展了“卫生日”、“卫生时”运动，使爱国卫生运动走向了经常化、制度化。
