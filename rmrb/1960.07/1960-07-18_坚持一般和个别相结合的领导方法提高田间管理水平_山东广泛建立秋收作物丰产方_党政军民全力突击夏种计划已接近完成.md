    Jinan, July 17 (by our own correspondent)　Leading cadres at all levels in rural Shandong Province, adhering to the forefront of production, using large-scale high-yield demonstration plots as bases, and following crop growth patterns, are leading the broad masses of commune members in vigorously grasping field management, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops.
    Under the guidance of the idea of agriculture as the foundation and the principle of combining multiple planting for multiple yields with high yields for multiple yields, Shandong Province has this year widely established large-scale high-yield demonstration plots for autumn harvest crops. According to incomplete statistics from Jinan, Liaocheng, Heze, Jining, Changwei, and Zibo six regions alone, the area of high-yield demonstration plots has reached more than 26.5 million mu. The area of high-yield demonstration plots generally accounts for more than 30% of the total cultivated land area.
    In the current field management campaign, leading cadres at all levels have taken high-yield demonstration plots as bases, going deep into the fields to command overall work. In the Jining region, 1,096 leading cadres at or above the level of commune Party committee secretary have entered high-yield demonstration plots to participate in production and lead production. The Heze region has universally promoted the leadership method of secretaries in charge of plots and cadres responsible for specific areas. High-yield demonstration plots of more than 10,000 mu are directly managed by the prefectural and county Party committees; 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration plots are personally managed by the commune Party committees, and plots of less than 1,000 mu are contracted to production teams. At present, more than 4,000 secretaries from the four levels of prefectural, county, commune, and brigade Party organizations throughout the region have entered high-yield demonstration plots, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of secretaries at these four levels.
    While basing themselves on high-yield demonstration plots, leading cadres at all levels have paid attention to general fields. By vigorously engaging in "three combinations" (cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians), summarizing management experience based on the growth patterns of various crops, they have vigorously grasped field management. At present, a million cadres (at six levels) across the province have convened in the fields, adhering to the principle of eating, living, working, and consulting with commune members. Through the "three combinations," vigorously promoting "three fields"—small-scale experimental fields, medium-scale command fields, and large-scale high-yield fields—they have formed an organic system network that drives the general fields. Leading cadres at or above the level of commune Party committee secretary in the Jining area have already established more than 395,000 mu of command fields. Yu Luo, the first secretary of the Qufu County Party Committee, and Xu Rurang, the secretary of the Secretariat, have already held three on-site meetings in the command fields to discuss management issues, promoting the rapid formation of a high tide of field management throughout the county. Zhang Jin, the first secretary of the Zhucheng County Party Committee, Li Huazheng, the agricultural secretary, and Wang Shifang, the director of the County Party Committee Office, moved their offices to the high-yield demonstration plots and established 8,600 mu of command fields. As of July 11, in the 990,000 mu (accounting for more than 50% of the total cultivated land area) of high-yield demonstration fields in the county, the 430,000 mu of spring-sown crops had been hoed four times and fertilized once; the 560,000 mu of summer-sown crops had also been hoed once, with 210,000 mu hoed twice, and more than 240,000 mu had been fertilized.
    Through the "three combinations" and vigorously promoting "three fields," various regions have summarized crop management experience, effectively improving the level of field management. The Junan County Party Committee has summarized the following field management measures for peanuts based on their growth patterns: timely cultivating and weeding; applying two key fertilizers in sufficient quantities and irrigating three key times; focusing on prevention and eliminating major pests and diseases; cultivating and weeding three to four times during the seedling stage, the round-plant stage, the flowering stage, and the late stage, respectively, and striving to hoe lightly the first time, deeply the second time, and as delicately as embroidery the third and fourth times. The broad masses of cadres and people in Junan County are vigorously grasping peanut field management based on these measures.
    While vigorously grasping field management with high-yield demonstration plots as bases, various regions have not relaxed their management of general fields and third-category seedlings. In order to ensure that water can be irrigated and fertilizer can be applied sufficiently even in highlands, the Heze region has also built large-scale machine irrigation and drainage stations based on high-yield demonstration plots, and has moved some pig, cattle, and sheep farms, feed processing plants, and fertilizer plants to the fields to ensure that general fields are well-fed and well-watered. The Zhangxia Commune Party Committee in Tai'an City, led by the secretary, established a command headquarters to promote the upgrading of third-category seedlings, organizing 2,500 people to specialize in managing third-category seedlings. After weeding and fertilizing, 2,500 mu of the 3,000 mu of third-category seedlings in the commune have been upgraded.
    (By our own correspondent) The people's communes in Shandong have had great success in drought-resistant planting and flood-resistant replanting. As of July 14, the planted area has reached 60 million mu, and the summer planting plan is nearly complete.
    Before June 24, the summer planting work in Shandong Province was carried out under severe drought conditions. After June 24, many areas successively received rainfall, and some areas experienced waterlogging due to heavy rain. Areas that did not receive rain or received little rain continued to carry out drought-resistant planting, while areas that experienced waterlogging launched a flood-resistant replanting struggle. The province formed two major battlefields: drought-resistant planting and flood-resistant replanting. Rainfall areas seized the favorable opportunity after the rain, and Party, government, military, civilian, and student sectors all went into action, launching a major planting campaign. Liaocheng and Linyi prefectures implemented the "three concentrations" of leadership, labor, and tools, greatly accelerating the planting work. In the summer planting battle of seizing time and seconds, various regions conscientiously implemented the "early, more, high, dense, good" five-character measures proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. Judging from the inspection, the area of land fertilized, shallowly tilled to eliminate stubble, and then sown in various regions has increased compared to last year; the dense planting measures have also been implemented relatively well; and the principle of combining multiple planting for multiple yields with high yields for multiple yields has been universally implemented. The area of intercropping sweet potatoes, corn, and soybeans in the province has reached more than 12 million mu. At the same time, various regions have also established many large-scale high-yield demonstration plots during summer planting. (Attached picture)

　　山东广泛建立秋收作物丰产方
　　党政军民全力突击夏种计划已接近完成
    本报济南17日电　山东省农村各级领导干部坚持深入生产第一线，以大面积丰产方为基地，按照作物生长规律，领导广大社员狠抓田间管理，争取秋季作物全面丰收。
    山东省各地在以农业为基础的思想和多种多收、高产多收相结合的方针指导下，今年广泛建立了秋收作物大面积丰产方。仅据济南、聊城、菏泽、济宁、昌潍、淄博六个地区的不完全统计，大面积丰产方面积即达二千六百五十多万亩。丰产方面积一般占耕地总面积30％以上。
    在当前的田间管理运动中，各级领导干部都以丰产方为基地，深入下去，指挥全面。济宁地区已有一千零九十六名公社党委书记以上的领导干部，进丰产方参加生产，领导生产。菏泽地区普遍推行了书记包方，各级干部专管的领导方法，万亩以上的丰产方，地委、县委直接抓；万亩丰产方，公社党委亲自抓，千亩以下的由生产队包起来。目前，全区地委、县委、公社、大队四级党组织的书记，进丰产方的已达四千多人，占四级书记总数的50％以上。
    各级领导干部在立足丰产方的同时，都注意到面对一般田。通过大搞“三结合”（干部、老农、技术员），根据各种作物生长规律，总结管理经验，大抓田间管理。目前，全省百万干部（六级干部）会师到田间，坚持与社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。通过“三结合”，大搞“三田”——小片的试验田，中片的指挥田，大片的丰产田，形成了一个有机的系统网，带动了一般田。济宁专区公社党委书记以上的领导干部，已搞了三十九万五千多亩指挥田。曲阜县委第一书记于洛、书记处书记徐瑞让，已在指挥田里就管理问题开了三次现场会，推动了全县迅速形成田间管理的高潮。诸城县委第一书记张进、农业书记李华政和常委、县委办公室主任王世芳等负责同志，把办公室搬到丰产方内，并建立了八千六百亩指挥田。到7月11日止，这个县全县九十九万亩（占耕地总面积50％以上）丰产方田中，四十三万亩春播作物已普锄四遍，普追一遍肥；五十六万亩夏播作物也普锄一遍，其中二十一万亩普锄两遍，已追肥的有二十四万多亩。
    各地通过“三结合”，大搞“三田”，总结作物管理经验，有效地提高了田间管理水平。莒南县委已根据花生生长规律，总结出花生田间管理措施是：及时中耕除草；追足两次关键肥，浇好三次关键水；以防为主，消灭主要病虫害；中耕除草要分别幼苗期、圆棵期、分花和晚期锄三至四遍，并要作到头遍刮（浅锄）、二遍挖（深锄）、三遍四遍如绣花。莒南县广大干部群众，正根据这些措施，狠抓花生田间管理。
    各地在以丰产方为基地狠抓田间管理的时候，丝毫没有放松对一般田和三类苗的管理。菏泽地区为了高岗地也能浇上水施足肥，还以丰产方为基地，大建机器排灌站，并且把一部分猪、牛、羊场、饲料加工厂和化肥厂搬到田间，保证一般田吃饱喝足。泰安市张夏公社党委由书记挂帅，成立促使三类苗升级指挥部，组织了二千五百人专管三类苗。经过锄草、追肥，全社三千亩三类苗已有二千五百亩升级。
    本报讯　山东各地人民公社抗旱播种和抗涝抢种已经获得很大成绩。到7月14日止，播种面积已达六千万亩，夏种计划已接近完成。
    6月24日以前，山东省的夏播工作一直是在严重干旱的情况下进行的。6月24日以后，不少地区陆续降雨，有的地区由于雨大发生了内涝。没有降雨和雨小的地区仍然抗旱抢种；发生内涝的地方又展开了抗涝抢种的斗争。全省形成了抗旱播种和抗涝抢种两大战场。降雨地区都抓紧雨后有利时机，党政军民学一齐上阵，展开了播种大突击。聊城、临沂两个专区实行领导、劳力、工具三集中，播种工作大大加快。在抢时间夺分秒的夏播战斗中，各地认真执行了省委提出的
  “早、多、高、密、好”五字措施。从检查的情况看来，各地经过施肥、浅耕灭茬而后下种的面积都比去年有所增多；密植措施执行的也比较好；多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，普遍得到了贯彻。全省实行地瓜、玉米、大豆间作的面积达一千二百多万亩。同时，各地在夏种中还建立了很多的大面积丰产方。（附图片）
