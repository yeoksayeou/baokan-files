Title: Shanghai's Nine Hundred Factories' Medical Staff Actively Promote the "Six No's Full Attendance" Campaign, Going Deep into Workshops and Before Furnaces to Prevent Illness Before It Occurs and Treat It Early if It Does; Teachers and Students of Zhejiang Medical University Organize Mobile Medical Services to Help Factories Improve Cooling Work

Xinhua News Agency Report: During the summer sanitation campaign, over 200 large factories with health stations and over 700 small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai launched the "Six No's Full Attendance" campaign. "Six No's Full Attendance" means: no severe heatstroke, no dust, no chemical poisoning, no electric ophthalmia, no illness, and no injuries, greatly reducing the incidence of illness among workers.

Some factories regard this campaign as an important measure to improve leadership style, care for the masses' lives, and improve production. The campaign is combined with the current major safety inspection, fully mobilizing the masses, who analyze the causes of illness and injury themselves and propose prevention measures. For example, the masses at the No. 4 State Cotton Factory made 8,139 suggestions in just three days, and more than 90% of them have now been resolved, 75% of which were resolved by mobilizing the workshop and group masses themselves. During the campaign, the vast number of medical personnel were more invigorated, going deep into the production front lines and working with the workers to carry out large-scale prevention work. They worked closely with factory medical personnel, requiring "early prevention of no disease, early treatment of disease, effective disease prevention, and prompt treatment."

The development of this campaign has greatly promoted the further improvement of factory labor hygiene conditions. For example, workers at the Ferroalloy Plant created a lead wire water curtain cooling system, which reduced the average temperature in the work area by 10 degrees Celsius. The work of dust prevention and prevention of electric ophthalmia has also been widely strengthened. In the urban area, 70% of factories with silica dust have basically achieved "no dust," and 82% of factories with electric welding have achieved no electric ophthalmia. In the prevention of chemical poisoning, the concentration of benzene in the air in more than 80% of small and medium-sized spraying and baking paint factories in the urban area has been reduced to the national health standard.

Many factories have seen a "three reductions" phenomenon due to the development of the campaign: fewer illnesses, reduced absenteeism, and fewer outpatient visits. The Fish Processing Factory has seen 54 full attendance groups out of a total of 122 production groups.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Medical personnel in various parts of Zhejiang go deep into workshops and before furnaces to do a good job of labor protection work and serve steel warriors.

In supporting steel production, teachers and students of Zhejiang Medical University worked and provided mobile medical services at the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, helping the factory improve heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment, which generally reduced the temperature in front of the furnace by four to nine degrees. They also opened small rest rooms and water curtain rest rooms in the workshop to provide workers with tea and water. Hangzhou First Hospital organized ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and stomatology physicians to conduct physical examinations for workers at the Xianlinbu Iron and Steel Plant, and proposed preventive measures for the high-temperature season, effectively ensuring the health of workers. At the same time, medical personnel at various iron and steel plants also generally went to workshops, construction sites, and work before the furnace. The temperature in the coking workshop of Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant reached over 1,200 degrees Celsius when the coke was released. Medical personnel used 2% boric acid ointment as a protective agent to prevent workers from being burned by strong radiant heat, which had a significant effect. Medical personnel in various places also actively carried out health publicity and education, passing on basic knowledge of various prevention methods to employees.

Going deep into the canteen to do a good job of sanitation is also an important part of medical personnel's support for steel production. Medical personnel at Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant went to the kitchen for a month, eating, living, working, and discussing with the cooks, strengthening sanitary supervision and cooking guidance, and improving the quality of meals, which the workers were very satisfied with.

　　上海九百多个工厂医务人员积极推动“六无全勤”运动
　　深入车间炉前无病早防有病早治
　　浙江医科大学师生组织巡回医疗帮助工厂搞好降温工作
    据新华社讯　在夏季卫生运动中，上海市有二百多家设有保健站的大厂和七百多家中小型工厂，掀起了“六无全勤”运动。“六无全勤”就是：无重症中暑、无粉尘、无化学中毒、无电光性眼炎、无病、无伤，使职工的发病率大大降低。
    有些工厂把这个运动作为改进领导作风，关心群众生活，搞好生产的一个重要措施。运动与当前的安全大检查相结合，充分发动群众，由群众自己分析病、伤原因，提出防病、防伤措施。如国棉四厂群众在短短三天中就提出建议八千一百三十九条，现在已经有90％以上得到了解决，其中75％是发动车间、小组群众自己解决的。运动中，广大医务人员更加振作起来，深入生产前线，与工人群众一起，大搞预防工作。他们和工厂医务人员紧密配合，要求做到“无病早防，有病早治，防病切实有效，治病迅速及时”。
    这一运动的开展，大大促进了工厂劳动卫生条件的进一步改善。如铁合金厂工人搞了铅丝水幕降温设备，作业地带平均降低了温度摄氏十度。防尘、防电光眼炎的工作也已普遍加强。市区有矽尘的工厂70％已基本上达到了“无尘”，有电焊的工厂82％做到了无电光性眼炎。预防化学中毒工作中，市区80％以上中小型喷烘漆厂空气中含苯浓度已减低到国家卫生标准。
    许多厂由于开展了运动，已出现发病率少、缺勤减少、门诊减少的“三减少”现象。鱼品加工厂在总计一百二十二个生产小组中已出现五十四个全勤小组。
    据新华社讯　浙江各地医务人员深入车间炉前，做好劳动保护工作，为钢铁战士服务。
    在支援钢铁生产中，浙江医科大学师生在半山钢铁厂边劳动，边巡回医疗，帮助工厂搞好防暑降温设备，使炉前温度普遍下降四至九度。他们还在车间开辟了小型休息室和水幕休息室，为工人送茶送水。杭州市第一医院组织眼科、耳鼻喉科和口腔科医师为闲林埠钢铁厂工人进行体格检查，并针对高温季节提出预防措施，有效地保障了工人的健康。同时，各钢铁厂医务人员也普遍到车间、工地和炉前工作。绍兴钢铁厂焦化车间出焦时温度高达一千二百度以上，医务人员采用2％的硼酸软膏作防护剂，防止工人被强烈的辐射热灼伤皮肤收到显著效果。各地医务人员还积极开展卫生宣传教育，把各种预防的基本知识交给职工群众。
    深入食堂做好卫生工作，也是医务人员支援钢铁生产的重要内容。绍兴钢铁厂医务人员先后下厨房一个月，与炊事员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，加强卫生监督和烹调指导，提高饭菜质量，工人都很满意。（附图片）
