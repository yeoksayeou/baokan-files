	More Rolled Steel to Support Agriculture
	The Party Committee of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill has strengthened the education of its employees regarding industrial support for agriculture. Since March, it has completed the order tasks for more than ten provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Shanxi, Hebei, Hunan, and Heilongjiang, on time with the required quality, quantity, and variety. It has produced a large number of steel products for agricultural use, such as round steel, ribbed steel, and square steel, effectively supporting the agricultural capital construction in these provinces and cities.
	
	Wood Utilization Rate Nearly Doubled
	The forestry departments of Heilongjiang Province have fully utilized tree bark, branches, roots, and other marginal materials to establish more than 2,100 comprehensive wood utilization factories and forest chemical factories, producing more than 90 kinds of products. As a result, the wood utilization rate in the forest area has increased from 46% to over 80%.

	Guarantee More Iron with Less Ore
	Iron and steel enterprises in Jiangxi Province are vigorously engaged in simple ore washing and sintering, adopting the method of "intensive cultivation," to ensure that more pig iron is produced with less ore. At present, more than 70 simple sintering furnaces have been built throughout the province. The daily output of sintered ore has increased from dozens of tons at the beginning of the year to more than 700 tons now, with grades generally above 45%. This has played a significant role in solving the problem of insufficient ore supply, ensuring that the blast furnace is well-fed, and achieving high quality and high yield.

	Cooperation Increases New Products
	The Chongqing Chemical Industry System has broken down inter-factory boundaries, and chemical plants cooperate and coordinate with each other in terms of raw materials, technology, and equipment. This has changed the past situation where the production of certain products in one factory was slow due to difficulties in raw materials, technology, and equipment. More than 150 new products have been put into batch production in the first half of this year.

	Consolidate and Improve Satellite Factories
	The Party Committee of the Changchun Automobile Factory, based on the principle of serving automobile production, has rectified and improved various satellite factories of the factory, and formally included several products produced by these factories in the state plan. In just ten days at the end of June, these factories produced more than 2,000 tons of raw materials such as steel and iron, and increased the number of products serving automobile production by more than 300.

	Substandard Ore Not Shipped Out
	Thanks to the fact that all employees of the Fanchang Mining Bureau in Anhui Province have established the idea of "quality first," all the ore shipped out this year has had an iron content of over 52%, with the highest reaching 63%. The mine has recently stipulated that no ore that has not been tested or does not meet the specifications is allowed to be shipped out.

	Coal Mine with No Accidents in Five Years
	The Third Mining Area of Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine unswervingly implements the Party's policy of safe production, and regularly and meticulously educates employees to establish the concept of safe production, and strictly implements various safety systems and measures of the coal mine. By the end of June, more than 300 employees in the area had not had any major work-related injuries for five years and eight months.

	Rural "Mobile Power Station"
	The Dalian Tractor Parts Factory has successfully trial-produced a simple agricultural vehicle. This vehicle has low fuel consumption, short wheelbase, and is suitable for traveling on narrow rural roads. Unlike ordinary car diesel engines, the diesel engine of this vehicle can drive a variety of agricultural machinery, so it is also a good mobile power station in the countryside.

	Rural Canteens Set Up Markets
	In the upsurge of vigorously supporting agricultural production, the commercial departments of Changtu County, Liaoning Province, created a new method of expanding procurement and sales business—setting up markets in the canteens of production teams. These markets use the time when members eat and rest to sell daily industrial products and purchase agricultural, sideline, local products, and waste products. In this way, members do not have to travel and do not delay production, which is very popular.

    多轧钢材支援农业
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂党委对职工加强关于工业支援农业的教育，从三月份以来，每月都按质按量按品种按时完成了上海、山西、河北、湖南和黑龙江等十多个省市的订货任务，为这些省生产了大批的圆钢、爆纹钢、方钢等农业用的钢材，有力地支援了这些省市的农业基本建设。
    木材利用率提高近一倍
    黑龙江省林业部门，充分利用树皮、树枝、树根等边材余料，办起两千一百多个木材综合利用工厂和林产化工厂，生产九十多种产品。从而使林区的木材利用率由百分之四十六提高到百分之八十以上。
    保证少用矿多炼铁
    江西省各地钢铁企业大搞矿石简易洗选和简易烧结，采用粗粮细作办法，保证用较少的矿石炼出更多的生铁。目前，全省已建起七十多个简易烧结炉，烧结矿石日产量由年初几十吨增加到现在的七百多吨，品位一般都在百分之四十五以上，对解决部分矿石供应不足，保证高炉吃饱吃好，实现优质高产起了很大作用。
    搞协作增产新产品
    重庆市化学工业系统打破厂际界线，各化工厂在原料、技术、设备等各方面互相协作配合，改变了过去一个厂生产某些产品因原料、技术、设备等困难投入生产迟缓的状况，使一百五十多种新产品在今年上半年及时成批投入了生产。
    整顿巩固提高卫星工厂
    长春汽车厂党委根据为汽车生产服务的原则，对本厂各种卫星厂进行整顿和提高，将这些工厂生产的若干种产品正式列入国家计划。仅六月末的十天中，这些工厂就生产钢、铁等原料材料两千多吨，增加为汽车生产服务的产品三百多种。
