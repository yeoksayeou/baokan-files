Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd — Avales, the head of the Cuban Workers' Confederation delegation currently visiting China, told our reporter in Beijing on the 21st that in order to defend the independence and sovereignty of their motherland, the Cuban people will resolutely fight to the end, and would rather sacrifice their precious lives than submit to U.S. imperialism.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation delegation has visited industrial cities such as Shanghai, Shenyang, and Anshan, as well as some people's communes in China, and has had extensive contact with people from all walks of life. Delegation head Avales praised the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people. He said that the sympathy and support of the Chinese workers, peasants and people from all walks of life for the Cuban revolution has greatly encouraged the Cuban people.

Avales condemned U.S. imperialism for being unwilling to accept defeat, unwilling to see Cuba gain independence and freedom, and for exerting various economic and political pressures, and even armed intervention, on Cuba in an attempt to strangle the Cuban revolution. He said: "Although the military strength of the United States is stronger than Cuba's, because the Cuban people's struggle is just and the Cuban people have a strong fighting will, final victory will surely belong to the Cuban people."

He said, "The Cuban people's struggle is not isolated. It has the support of 200 million Latin American people, the firm support of 650 million heroic Chinese people, and the spiritual and material support of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Avales pointed out that the current international situation is very different from the situation in 1954 when U.S. imperialism strangled the Guatemalan revolution.

He said: "The people of the world have entered a more resolute stage of anti-imperialist struggle. The victorious struggles of the Algerian people, the Congolese people, the Japanese people, and the South Korean people all show that the days of U.S. imperialism are numbered."

He described U.S. imperialism as an eagle that has been plucked of its feathers and is now on a downward slope. He said that the experience of China's War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea have shown that U.S. imperialism can be completely defeated.

When talking about his impressions of visiting China, Avales said: The brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the past ten years have set a very good example for the people of the world, especially for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries.

    古巴工会代表团团长在北京发表谈话
    古巴人民的斗争不是孤立的
    据新华社22日讯　正在我国访问的古巴工人联合会代表团团长阿伐莱斯21日在北京接见本社记者时说，为了保卫祖国的独立和主权，古巴人民将坚决斗争到底，宁可牺牲自己的宝贵生命，也绝不向美帝国主义屈服。
    古巴工人联合会代表团在中国访问了上海、沈阳、鞍山等工业城市和一些人民公社，并且和各界人民有了广泛接触。代表团团长阿伐莱斯盛赞中国人民的革命气概和劳动热情。他说，中国工农群众和各界人民对古巴革命的同情和支持，给予古巴人民很大鼓舞。
    阿伐莱斯谴责美帝国主义不甘心失败，不甘心看到古巴获得独立、自由，对古巴施以种种经济、政治压力，甚至武装干涉，企图扼杀古巴革命。他说：“尽管美国的军事力量比古巴强大，但是由于古巴人民的斗争是正义的，古巴人民有着坚强的斗争意志，最后的胜利一定属于古巴人民”。
    他说，“古巴人民的斗争不是孤立的，它有着两亿拉丁美洲人民的支持，六亿五千万英勇的中国人民的坚决支持，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营从精神到物质的支持。”
    阿伐莱斯指出，当今的国际形势与1954年美帝国主义扼杀危地马拉革命时候的形势，已大不相同。
    他说：“全世界人民已经进入一个更加坚决的反帝国主义斗争阶段。阿尔及利亚人民，刚果人民，日本人民，南朝鲜人民胜利斗争都说明美帝国主义的日子不长了。”
    他形容美帝国主义现在是一只被拔掉羽毛的老鹰，正在走着下坡路。他说，中国解放战争和抗美援朝的经验都说明，美帝国主义是完全可以击败的。
    阿伐莱斯在谈到他访问中国的印象时说：中国人民十年来所取得的辉煌成就，为全世界人民，特别是为殖民地半殖民地人民树立了一个很好的榜样。
