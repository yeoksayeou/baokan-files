Broad Road
Shandong Qufu Normal College's Practical Application and Theoretical Exploration of Operations Research
By our reporter Wang Jianlin

Jining, Shandong, is an ancient town. The Grand Canal runs through it. Highways extend in all directions, and railways connect to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Historically and presently, it is a hub for water and land transport, a major transportation artery.

Around the Jining Railway Station, bus station, canal wharf, and other areas, a web of short-distance transport vehicles bustles incessantly. Workers transport urgently needed goods to their owners day and night. However, due to the strained transportation capacity, a large amount of cargo is always piled up in warehouses, unable to be shipped out quickly.

In this situation, empty vehicles constantly flowed in opposite directions and roundabout transportation occurred on various transportation lines. One day, there were 160 instances of empty vehicles traveling in opposite directions on the half-kilometer road from the canal wharf to the Coal Construction Company alone.

Could this phenomenon be avoided to the greatest extent? Yes. After rational dispatching of all vehicles of the Jining Transportation Company, the mileage utilization rate has increased from the original 50% to 73%, an increase of 23%.

This involves a discipline called "linear programming." It is a member of the modern mathematical family.

Go to Production, Serve Production

Mathematics is a discipline that people have summarized over thousands of years in their struggle with nature. It originates from practice and serves practice. However, in its development process, some people artificially divide it into practical and basic theoretical parts unrelated to production; others engage in mathematical research for the sake of science, from theory to theory, severely detached from production practice.

Faced with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the inability of transportation capacity to keep up, the Party Committee of Qufu Normal College decided to start with the research and application of linear programming. At that time, linear programming had just been introduced to China. After teachers taught students the only domestic "Linear Programming Lecture Notes," they set off separately. More than sixty second-year students and teachers came to the Jining Prefectural Transportation Bureau, motorcade, and automobile repair shop.

Teachers and students traveled almost all over the Heze and Jining areas, rode in cars on various highways, investigated freight yards, sources of goods, loading and unloading, routes, etc., and humbly consulted with workers. After more than twenty days and nights, they finally discovered more than thirty problems in transportation such as empty vehicle flow and waiting for loading and unloading. Later, they also found unreasonable phenomena such as the transportation of the same materials in opposite directions and "not taking the chord but the arc" on transportation lines in material allocation and short-distance transportation. Teachers and students, together with dispatchers and workers, used the "graphical method" and "tabular method" in linear programming to rationally adjust vehicle dispatching and material transportation plans, resulting in great success.

After the mileage utilization rate of flatbed trucks in Jining City Transportation Company stabilized at 73% and the mileage utilization rate of horse-drawn carriages increased to 96%, the monthly increase in transportation capacity was equivalent to more than 570,000 yuan in freight, and the annual increase in production for the country was more than 6.86 million yuan. After the Jining Prefectural Commercial Bureau used linear programming to adjust a series of plans for material production, transportation, sales, and storage in the entire region, it could save more than 2.22 million yuan in freight for the country throughout the year. The sum of these two aspects can buy 606 Liberation brand cars or 908 tractors. What an amazing number!

Now, in the Jining area, linear programming is used from automobiles to horse-drawn carriages, flatbed trucks, and even ship transportation. The mileage utilization rate of automobiles has increased by 12%, and the voyage utilization rate of ships has increased from 40% to 79%.

Currently, the scope of mathematical research serving production at Qufu Normal College has expanded even further. Teachers and students have come to people's communes, state-owned farms, water conservancy construction sites, and factories. They have applied linear programming to rational material cutting in factories, rational design of assembly lines, and rational layout of processing plants and warehouses. Even in the famous Jining Yutang Sauce Garden, linear programming has been used in the sewing industry, construction industry, and kiln industry. Teachers and students used probability theory knowledge in enterprises such as Jining Bearing Factory, and creatively created a complete set of quality control plans suitable for small and medium-sized factories, and the work efficiency generally increased by 40% to 100%.

Of more practical significance is that this normal college, in order to adapt to the needs of large-scale management of people's communes, has created a unique mathematical discipline "Commune Mathematics." The teachers and students in the labor allocation group asked the production team leader to treat them as ordinary labor to be allocated. They worked with the commune members to understand the problems in labor allocation. The teachers and students in the crop layout group held various forums with experienced farmers, model workers, technicians, and team cadres to understand the distribution of soil and local planting conditions based on local conditions. When problems were not discovered, teachers and students repeatedly studied "On Practice"; when there was a large amount of material, they analyzed the main contradictions and the main aspects of contradictions according to Chairman Mao's theory of contradiction, and found the internal connections to gradually solve them. Now, under the direct care of the local Party committee, teachers and students have used linear programming and other mathematical methods to compile a complete set of plans to serve the commune's production and life, such as labor allocation, crop layout, wheat field setting, processing plant, breeding farm setting, material transportation, canal system design, simple calculation, estimation, measurement, etc. According to the actual accounting of the commune Party committee, the implementation of the wheat harvesting labor allocation plan saved more than 10,000 labor days for the entire commune. Rational wheat field settings enabled the wheat harvesting task that originally required twelve days to be completed six days earlier. Combining the advantages of abacus, table calculation, and card calculation, the large-digit multiplication and division calculation ruler was successfully created, increasing calculation efficiency by three to five times. Under the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, these three items have been widely promoted throughout the province. The broad masses of commune members have personally seen the significant effect of mathematics serving agricultural production, and they have unanimously praised it. A production team leader named Zhang Zhaoshen happily said: "Commune mathematics is really good, saving labor, saving people, and increasing efficiency; thank the Party and Chairman Mao, every job has a magic weapon."

Applying mathematics widely to people's communes is a pioneering undertaking, which has aroused widespread interest in the mathematical community.

From Practice, Ascend to Theoretical Peaks

Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "Rational knowledge depends on perceptual knowledge, and perceptual knowledge needs to be developed to rational knowledge. This is the epistemology of dialectical materialism." This irrefutable truth illuminated the hearts of teachers and students and guided the path of their mathematical research.

At first, in the face of a large number of practical problems, teachers and students felt clueless for a while. Gradually, everyone used judgment and reasoning methods to carefully analyze the rich sensory materials in transportation and material allocation, and to find their regularity. Finally, they summarized from many phenomena such a question, namely, "Under the condition of a certain number of vehicles, given a transportation task, how can the vehicles be rationally allocated in order to complete the task in the shortest time?" In order to transform it into a mathematical problem, teachers and students of the linear programming group repeatedly analyzed and researched, and widely absorbed the opinions of veteran workers and dispatchers. After more than fifty discussions, they finally came up with a planning problem with a new mathematical form, which they named "Maximum and Minimum Problem of Multiple Functions."

After the first hurdle was broken through, what followed was how to solve such a planning problem. For this group of young teachers and students, there were really many difficulties. At this time, Zheng Youqiao, secretary of the Party branch of the Mathematics Department, came to the teachers and students with a letter from Yu Xunchun, secretary of the college Party committee. The letter said: "There is no smooth road to take in scientific research. Victory is always accompanied by difficulties, and overcoming difficulties is victory!" The words of the Party were like a spark, igniting the spark of wisdom of teachers and students again.

Teachers and students studied theoretical knowledge more diligently, repeatedly studied the linear programming lecture notes, and discussed problems together. Once, a second-year student suddenly proposed: Can the solution of this planning problem be listed as a group of linear programming problems to be solved one by one, and then the best solution can be selected from them?

The college Party committee keenly saw this promising trend in the research of teachers and students, and firmly grasped this trend, instructing teachers and students to send the materials to the Mathematics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for comments. Soon, the Mathematics Institute replied: This issue is of both practical and theoretical value. The papers they wrote were listed as one of the papers with major achievements in the theoretical development of operations research at the Second National Mathematics Congress. Its results have begun to be applied in individual research projects of major engineering projects in other places.

Teachers and students of this normal college, in the most vivid and active production practice, through bold exploration, have also drawn a series of inferences and theorems in mathematics. In material allocation, they obtained the uniqueness theorem on the regular flow diagram; they found two new methods for the initial solution of the tabular method--"Large and Small Element Method" and "Comprehensive Method." In the creation of commune mathematics, they have successively written a total of twenty-two papers, explored fifteen theoretical problems, and written three treatises of more than 400,000 words in total, such as "Research and Application of Linear Programming."

Firm Roots, Flowers Bloom Everywhere

With the strong help of teachers and students from Qufu Normal College, linear programming has been widely promoted in the three regions of Jining, Heze, and Linyi, from the region to the counties and then to most of the people's communes; from transportation and material allocation to industrial and agricultural production and many other departments, linear programming is being researched and applied everywhere. Since March, the Jining Prefectural Committee has held two on-site meetings in the entire region. The Prefectural Committee has established a linear programming office, and the counties and cities have also established leading groups. The first secretaries of the Party committees of six counties and cities including Tengxian and Zaozhuang are personally in charge, listing linear programming as one of the important projects of the current technological revolution and institutionalizing it. In the past few months, the three regions have successively held on-site meetings and set up training courses 129 times, training more than 24,000 people, and more than 1.89 million workers and peasants have heard reports on linear programming.

Once the workers and peasants grasped the principles and methods of linear programming and saw its effectiveness, an unspeakable joy burst out from the bottom of their hearts: "There is such a big science in transportation and commune production, and science is really useful!" People talked about it on the streets, affectionately calling linear programming the "double-trip operation method", and calling rational wheat field setting and rational organization of wheat harvesting labor "wheat harvesting mathematics". The masses have summarized many benefits of using linear programming from their personal experience.

It is the Party that has opened the treasure house of the wisdom of the masses. The treasures in this treasure house are endless. When explaining linear programming, they really give one example and understand three, and their degree of understanding is amazing. There is a dispatcher named Chen Lihe in Jining City Transportation Company who has been pulling flatbed trucks for many years. He only has a primary school education. After learning linear programming, he also opened a training class in his company to give lectures. Under his promotion, more than 30 people in the company have mastered linear programming. He is already very proficient in using linear programming, reducing the time it takes to develop a vehicle dispatching plan from the original four hours to just over an hour. A dozen dispatchers in the Jining Prefectural Commercial Bureau not only mastered the graphical method, but also could use the more complex tabular method. The methods for formulating rational wheat field settings and crop layout plans in commune mathematics have been mastered by the cadres of many communes and teams.

Once mathematics is handed over to the masses, it can exert tremendous power. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres love linear programming and try to apply it to practice. There is a sewing group in Sangcun Commune, Tengxian County. After learning linear programming, everyone discussed together: Can linear programming be used in sewing? As a result, the implementation of rational cutting using the graphical method not only improved work efficiency, but also greatly saved fabric. A planning section chief in the Jining Prefectural Commercial Bureau also ingeniously applied linear programming to improve statistical reports, enabling the work of summarizing the region's statistical reports every month to be completed six days earlier.

This is a flower that has blossomed under the careful irrigation and cultivation of the Party; this is a flower that has blossomed under the nourishment of communist rain and dew and the sunshine of the general line.

Mathematical research serves production, and there is a broad road! The combination of teaching, production labor, and scientific research has a bright future.

    广阔的路
    山东曲阜师范学院对运筹学的实际应用和理论探讨
    本报记者　王建林
    山东济宁，古老的城镇。京杭大运河贯通而过。公路四通八达，铁路连接津浦干线。古今都是水陆码头，交通要道。
    在济宁火车站、汽车站、运河码头等周围蛛网般的线路上，短途运输车辆，川流不息。工人们夜以继日将货主急切需要的物资，运送到他们手里。但因运输力量紧张，总有大批货物在货栈上堆积着，不能尽快运出。
    就在这种情况下，在各条运输线路上，不断发生着空车对流和迂回运输现象。有一天，单是从运河码头到煤建公司半公里的路上，空车对流就有一百六十车次。
    这种现象，可否避免到最大限度呢？可以。济宁运输公司的全部车辆，经合理调度后，里程利用率已经由原先的50％上升到73％，提高了23％。
    这当中用得着一门学问，这门学问叫做“线性规划”。它是现代数学大家庭中的一个成员。
    到生产中去，为生产服务
    数学，是人们千百年来在同大自然斗争中，总结出来的一门学问。它来源于实践，又为实践服务。但在它的发展过程中，有人人为地将它割裂为实用的和同生产无缘的基本理论两个部分；也有的在数学研究中为科学而科学，从理论到理论，严重脱离生产实际。
    面对着工农业生产飞跃发展，运输力量跟不上这一情况，曲阜师范学院党委决定首先从线性规划的研究与应用着手。当时，线性规划刚刚介绍到国内不久。教师向学生讲授了一本国内仅有的“线性规划讲义”后，就分头出发了。二年级六十多名学生同教师来到了济宁专署交通局、汽车队和汽车修配厂。
    师生们几乎踏遍整个菏泽、济宁地区，随汽车奔驰在各条公路上，考查货场、货源、装卸、路线等情况，并虚心向工人请教。前后经过二十几个日日夜夜，他们终于发现了空车对流、等装待卸等三十多个运输当中的问题。后来，在物资调拨和短途运输中又找出了同种物资相向运输和在运输线路上“不走弓弦走弓背”的不合理现象。师生们和调度人员、工人等一起，运用线性规划中的“图上作业法”和“表上作业法”，对车辆调度和物资调运方案进行合理调整，结果获得了很大的成效。
    济宁市运输公司在地排车里程利用率稳定在73％、马车里程利用率提高到96％后，每月提高的运力，合运费五十七万多元，全年可为国家增产六百八十六万多元。济宁专署商业局运用线性规划，对全区物资产、运、销、储一系列方案进行调整后，全年可为国家节省运费二百二十二万多元。这两方面的钱加起来，可买解放牌汽车六百零六辆，可买拖拉机九百零八台。这是一个多么惊人的数字！
    现在济宁地区，从汽车到马车、地排车以至船舶运输，都运用了线性规划。汽车提高里程利用率12％，船舶航程利用率由40％提高到79％。
    目前，曲阜师范学院数学研究为生产服务的范围更加扩大。师生们来到了人民公社、国营农场和水利工地，来到工厂企业。他们已将线性规划用于工厂中的合理下料，流水作业线合理设计、加工厂和仓储合理布局等方面。甚至在著名的济宁玉堂酱园，在缝纫业、建筑业、窑业中也用上了线性规划。师生们运用概率论知识，在济宁轴承厂等企业，还创造性地搞出了一整套适合中小型工厂的质量控制方案，工效普遍提高40％至一倍。
    更有实际意义的是，这所师范学院，为了适应人民公社大规模经营管理的需要，创建了一门别具风格的数学学科“公社数学”。劳力调配组的师生，要求生产小队长把自己当作一名普通劳力调配，他们同社员一起劳动，从中摸清劳力调配中的问题。作物布局组的师生，召开老农、劳动模范、技术人员、小队干部等各种座谈会，了解土壤分布和当地因地种植情况。在发现不出问题时，师生就反复学习“实践论”；当有了大堆材料时，就又根据毛主席关于矛盾论的原理，分析主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，并找出其中的内在联系，逐步加以解决。现在，师生们在当地党委的直接关怀下，运用线性规划和其它数学方法，已编制出了一整套为公社生产和生活服务的方案，如劳力调配、作物布局、麦场设置、加工厂、饲养场设置、物资调运、渠系设计、简易计算、估产、测量，等等。麦收劳力调配方案执行结果，据公社党委实际核算，全公社节省了一万多个劳动工日。麦场合理设置，使原需十二天完成的麦收任务提前六天完成。综合珠算、表算、卡片计算的优点，创制成功的大位乘除助算尺，提高计算效率三至五倍。这三项，在山东省委指示下，已在全省普遍推广。广大社员群众亲眼看到数学为农业生产服务的显著效果，齐声叫好。有一名叫张照慎的生产小队长高兴地说：“公社数学真正好，省工省人效率高；感谢党和毛主席，样样工作有法宝。”
    把数学广泛用到人民公社中来，这是一个创举，它引起了数学界的普遍兴趣。
    从实践中来，攀理论高峰
    毛主席在“实践论”中说：“理性认识依赖于感性认识，感性认识有待于发展到理性认识，这就是辩证唯物论的认识论。”这个颠扑不破的真理照亮了师生的心，指引着师生数学研究的道路。
    当初，在大量的实际问题面前，师生们一时感到毫无头绪。逐渐地，大家运用判断和推理的办法，将交通运输、物资调拨中丰富的感觉材料，认真加以分析，寻找它们的规律性。末了，从许多现象中归结出了这样一个问题，即“在一定车辆的条件下，给定一个运输任务，如何合理地调配车辆，才能在最短时间内完成任务？”为了将它化成一个数学问题，线性规划小组的师生，反复分析研究，并广泛吸取老工人、调度人员的意见，经五十多次讨论，终于得出了一个具有新的数学形式的规划问题，他们给它起名叫“多个函数的最大最小问题”。
    第一关突破后，接连而来的便是对这样一个规划问题，如何解决。这对于这伙年青的师生来说，困难实在很多。这时，数学系党总支书记郑又樵拿着院党委书记于勋忱的信来到师生面前，信中说：“在科学研究上是没有平坦大路可走的。胜利总是伴有困难，克服困难就是胜利！”党的话像火种，又点燃起了师生智慧的火花。
    师生们更勤奋地学习理论知识，反复钻研那本线性规划讲义，遇到问题，师生一起讨论。有次，一个二年级学生突然提出：是否可以将这个规划问题的解决，列成一组线性规划问题来逐个解决，然后再从中选出最好的解法呢？
    院党委锐敏地看到了师生们研究中出现的这个有希望的苗头，并紧紧抓住这个苗头，指示师生将材料寄到中国科学院数学研究所征询意见。不久，数学研究所在回信中说：这个问题，既有实际意义，又有理论价值。他们写出的论文，在全国第二届数学代表大会上被列为全国在运筹学理论发展上有主要成果的论文之一。它的成果，已在外地重大工程的个别研究项目中开始应用。
    这所师范学院的师生，在最生动最活跃的生产实际中，通过大胆的探讨，还在数学方面得出了一系列的推论和定理。在搞物资调运中，他们获得了关于正规流向图的唯一性定理；找到了表上作业法初始方案的两个新作法——“大小原素法”“综合法”。在创建公社数学中，他们先后共写出了二十二篇论文，探索出十五个理论性问题，写出了“线性规划研究与应用”等共四十多万字的三本论著。
    根子扎得牢，花开遍地红
    在曲阜师范学院师生大力帮助下，线性规划在济宁、菏泽、临沂等三个专区已普遍推广开来，从专区到各县再到大部分人民公社；从交通运输、物资调拨到工农业生产等好多部门，到处都在研究和应用线性规划。济宁地委3月份以来，召开了两次全区现场会议，地委专门成立了线性规划办公室，各县、市也建立了领导小组。滕县、枣庄等六个县、市都是党委第一书记亲自挂帅，把线性规划列为当前技术革命重要项目之一，并把它制度化。几个月来，三个专区先后召开现场会和开设训练班一百二十九次，训练二万四千多人，有工农群众一百八十九万多人听到了关于线性规划的报告。
    工农群众一经掌握了线性规划的原理和方法，看到了它的成效，一种难以言论的喜悦从心底迸发出来：“交通运输、公社生产中还有这么大的科学，科学这玩艺真管用！”人们街谈巷议，把线性规划亲切地称为“双程作业法”，把麦场合理设置和麦收劳力合理组织，叫做“麦收数学”。群众从切身体验中总结出了运用线性规划的许多条好处。
    是党，打开了群众智慧的宝库。这个宝库的珍藏，无穷无尽。在讲解线性规划时，真是举一反三，他们的理解程度大得惊人。济宁市运输公司有个拉了多年地排车的调度员，名叫陈礼和。他只有高小程度，在学会线性规划后，又在本公司开办训练班讲课。在他的推动下，全公司已有三十多人掌握了线性规划。他运用线性规划已经非常熟练，由原来四个多小时制订一个调车方案，降到只用一个多小时就够了。济宁专区商业局有十几个调度员，不但掌握了图上作业法，也能运用较为复杂的表上作业法。公社数学中制订麦场合理设置和作物合理布局方案的方法，已为许多公社的社队干部所掌握了。
    数学一旦交给群众，就能发挥巨大力量。广大工农群众和干部喜爱线性规划，便设法把它运用到实际中来。滕县桑村公社有个缝纫组，学了线性规划后，大家就一起商量：缝纫中能不能用上线性规划？结果，用图上作业法实行合理剪裁，不但提高了工效，而且大大节省了用布。济宁专署商业局有个计划科长，还独出心裁地将线性规划应用到改进统计报表中来，使每月汇总全区统计报表的工作，提前六天完成。
    这是在党的细心灌溉栽培下，开放出来的一朵花；这是在共产主义雨露滋润、总路线阳光照射下，开放出来的一朵花。
    数学研究为生产服务，有着广阔的路！教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合，前途似锦。
