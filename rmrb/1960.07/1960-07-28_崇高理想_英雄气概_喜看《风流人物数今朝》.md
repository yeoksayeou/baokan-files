    Lofty Ideals, Heroic Spirit
    ——A Joyful Look at "Distinguished Figures of Our Time"
    Li Yuenan
    After seeing the film "Distinguished Figures of Our Time," which features advanced deeds of the technological revolution, it was like attending a vivid political lesson. During the film's screening, I felt as if I had left my seat and wholeheartedly immersed myself in the battle after battle, centered around the protagonist Gao Hailin, to advance towards science and technology. Under the inspiration of the Three Red Banners, and amidst the current enthusiastic wave of technological and cultural revolutions, the young technical worker Gao Hailin, like millions of workers and laborers in our country, harbors a high fighting spirit and the lofty great ideal of communism, establishing ambitious goals and lofty aspirations, vowing to change our country's "poor and blank" state, and scaling the peak of world science and culture. "What the world has, we must also have; what the world does not have, we must create!" The words of encouragement from the factory Party Secretary became the clear fighting goal of him and the entire staff of the Hongguang Scientific Instrument Factory. Thus, the formation of the plot and the portrayal of the characters rapidly unfolded around the question of how to break through the advanced scientific and technological fortress of the high-voltage bridge. The high-voltage bridge is extremely important for our country's modern industry, but in the past, it had to be imported from capitalist countries, and even with money, we couldn't buy good, new products. This is something our working brothers could not accept. Gao Hailin and his comrades, having only obtained an old photo of a high-voltage bridge from the factory's chief engineer, treated it as a treasure, eager to try. However, the growth of new things is not always smooth. In addition to overcoming difficulties in material equipment, he also had to overcome the resistance of backward thinking. When Gao Hailin's wishes were supported by the Party and the masses, he disregarded the opposition from Chief Qian, who held narrow economic views, and Master Song, who had a degree of conservative thinking, and studied and experimented day and night. They failed and tried again, once, twice… until the three hundred and seventy-first time. With the support and meticulous encouragement and care from the Party Secretary, failure and difficulties did not scare Gao Hailin, but instead made him more heroic and stronger. He fought tenaciously. Resolutely listening to the Party, relying on the collective strength and wisdom of the masses, was the key to unlocking every difficult hurdle. Continuous revolution and continuous struggle are the true colors of the working class and the true colors of our era. All of this is concentratedly reflected in Gao Hailin, who dares to think, dares to speak, and dares to create.
    In the concerted efforts of the screenwriter, director, and actors, not only was the heroic image of the younger generation of technical workers represented by Gao Hailin created, but also the images of veteran worker Master Zhang and veteran worker and Gao Hailin's father-in-law, Master Song. Master Song has rich technical experience, respects the leadership of the Party, loves the factory like his home, cherishes every bit of the country's property, and cares about the growth of his apprentices… All of this shows the merits of the veteran workers. However, unlike Master Zhang, his thinking is not open and his character is not straightforward. Especially in dealing with new things, he is a step behind Zhang. In the plot, Master Song often uses his subjective desire to improve production and the negative effects brought about by his conservative thinking, forming contradictions that are difficult for him to understand. Sometimes, the appearance of this contradiction even provokes laughter. However, the laughter itself is a sharp criticism of conservative thinking. Revolutionary masses, starting from the interests of the revolution, will not sympathize with any kind of "subjective desire" that hinders the development of advanced vitality. Therefore, when Master Song was having a New Year's Eve dinner with his daughter and son-in-law, and was criticized by Gao Hailin, he angrily left the table. At this point in the plot, the intensification of the two contradictions, old and new, appeared. The audience simultaneously sweated for the mentor and apprentice (also father-in-law and son-in-law), worrying both that Gao Hailin's emotions would be hurt again, and that Master Song would be able to change.
    "Yes, I didn't listen to the Party's words," Master Song finally said this self-critical sentence after ideological struggle. It should be said that it is not easy for veteran workers of his type; this is a clear sign that his thinking has initially changed under the help of the branch secretary, showing the Party's great political care and ideological cultivation for veteran workers like Master Song; it also shows the great victory of the policy of unity-criticism-unity put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao for correctly handling contradictions among the people. The fact is that, due to Master Song's ideological transformation, his skills had heroic application; he exerted his great potential, able to help break through the last difficult hurdle, so that the Chinese-made high-voltage bridge was finally successfully put into production.
    What is particularly attractive is that every time the Party branch secretary appears, it is in times of difficulty. His short, powerful, aphoristic speeches speak to the hearts of the workers. His correct attitude and views towards difficulties affect the surrounding masses; the entire film, through the words and actions of this secretary, runs through a red line – that is, the Party's strong leadership. This red line is a powerful guarantee for the rapid improvement of the masses' political consciousness and the rapid development of socialist cause.
    "Distinguished Figures of Our Time" is a relatively good film. It not only reflects the current major themes and has a clear theme, but also has many successes in artistic creation. However, the handling of individual plots is not natural enough. Perhaps it is because the actors spent less time experiencing factory life and did not feel the workers' life struggle deeply enough.
    I hope that more good films reflecting the heroic images and heroic deeds of the working class will be made in the future. The vast audience is looking forward to it!

    崇高理想　英雄气概
    ——喜看《风流人物数今朝》
    李岳南
    看了以技术革命先进事迹为题材的《风流人物数今朝》影片后，无异是上了一堂生动的政治课。影片放映过程中，我好像是离开了观众的座位，全身心地投入到以主人公高海林为中心的一场接一场的向科学技术进军的战斗中。在三面红旗的鼓舞下，在当前的热火朝天的技术革命和文化革命浪潮中，青年技术工人高海林正如我国千百万工人同志和劳动群众一样，怀着昂扬的斗志和崇高的共产主义伟大理想，树雄心，立大志，誓要改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，攀登世界科学文化的顶峰。“世界上有的，我们也要有；世界上没有的，我们要创造！”厂党委书记对他勉励的话，变成了他和虹光科学仪器厂全厂职工的鲜明的奋斗目标；于是，故事情节的形成，人物性格的刻划，就围绕着如何攻破高压电桥这一尖端科学技术堡垒而迅速地开展下去。高压电桥，对我国现代工业有着极为重要的用途，可是在过去，得从资本主义国家进口，我们花了钱还买不到好的新的成品，这是我国工人兄弟们所不服气的。高海林和他的战友们仅仅得到厂总工程师的一张高压电桥的旧照片，就如获至宝，跃跃欲试，然而，新生事物的成长，不是一帆风顺的，他除了要克服物质设备上的困难，还要战胜落后思想的阻力。当高海林的愿望得到党和群众的支持的时候，他便不顾那位抱着狭隘经济观点的钱科长和有着一定程度保守思想的宋师傅的反对，日日夜夜地琢磨起来，试制起来了。他们失败了又再来，一次两次……，直到三百七十一次。在党委书记的支持和无微不至的鼓励关怀下，失败和困难，并不能把高海林吓倒，反而把他锻炼得更英勇、更坚强了，他顽强地战斗着。坚决听党的话，依靠群众的集体力量和智慧，就是他开启每一个困难关的钥匙。不断革命，不断斗争，是工人阶级的本色，是我们时代的本色。这一些都集中地表现在敢想敢说敢创的高海林的身上。
    在编剧、导演和演员的通力协作中，不但创造了以高海林为代表的青年一代技术工人的英雄形象，也创造了像老工人张师傅和老工人、海林的岳父宋师傅的形象。宋师傅有丰富的技术经验，尊敬党的领导，爱厂如家，珍惜国家的点滴财物，也关怀徒弟的成长……所有这一切，都显示了老工人的优点。可是，他不像张师傅那样思想开展、性格爽直，特别在对待新生事物上，是比张落后了一步。在剧情中，宋师傅常常以他的搞好生产的主观心愿和他的保守思想所带来的不良效果，构成了使他自己难以理解的矛盾。有时，这种矛盾的出现，甚至引人发笑。但是，这种笑的本身，就是对保守思想的尖锐批判。革命群众从革命利益着眼，是不会同情任何一种阻挠先进生命力发展的“主观愿望”的。因此，当宋师傅在同女儿女婿吃年饭，受了高海林的批评，愤然离席时，剧情发展到这里，出现了新旧两种矛盾的激化状态。观众同时为他们师徒（也是翁婿）捏一把汗，既耽心高海林情绪再一次受到挫伤，也耽心宋师傅是否能够转变过来。
    “是的，我没听党的话”，到后来，宋师傅经过思想斗争，终于说出了这一句自我检讨式的话。应该说，在他这一类型的老工人是不容易的；这是在支书的帮助下他的思想初步有了转变的显明标志，显示了党对于像宋师傅这样的老工人们在政治上的极大的关怀和思想上的培养；也显示了党和毛主席所提出的团结——批评——团结这一正确处理人民内部矛盾的政策方针的伟大胜利。事实是这样：由于宋师傅思想的转变，才使他的技术有了英雄用武之地；发挥了他的巨大潜力，能帮助突破最后一次难关，使中国造的高压电桥终于成功地投入生产了。
    特别吸引人的地方：是党支部书记的每一次出场，都是困难当头之际，他的简短有力的警句式的讲话，句句说到职工们的心坎上，他对待困难的正确态度和看法，影响着周围的群众；整部影片，通过这位书记的一言一动，贯穿了一条红线——即党的坚强领导。这条红线，就是群众的政治觉悟迅速提高和社会主义事业迅速发展的有力保证。
    《风流人物数今朝》是一部较好的影片，它不仅反映了当前的重大题材，主题鲜明，而且在艺术创造上，也有许多成功之处。但个别情节上的处理，还不够自然。也许是由于演员体验工厂生活时间较短，对工人生活斗争感受得还不够深。
    希望今后多拍制像这样反映工人阶级英雄形象和英雄事迹的好影片，广大观众在期待着呢！
