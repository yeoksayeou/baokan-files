    Launch a Multi-Transportation Steel Protection Competition
    Workers on the transportation front in Chongqing have launched a large-scale steel protection competition to ensure that the "marshal" of steel is well-fed. Recently, the cargo throughput of the entire Chongqing Port has increased by more than 30%, ensuring that steel materials are unloaded as soon as they arrive, without backlog. Stevedores at the Caiyuanba Wharf have tried every means to improve transportation tools, greatly increasing transportation efficiency from more than 100 tons of materials loaded and unloaded per day to more than 300 tons.

    Manufacturing Chinese-Style Valves
    Workers at the Dalian Valve Factory, after a week of hard work, produced a unique check valve. They used the materials originally used to produce one valve to produce six to eight valves, saving two-thirds of the man-hours. Moreover, the quality is good, the performance is high, and it can automatically control water flow. The factory is determined to reform twelve major products into small, high-performance, low-material-consuming, and highly efficient Chinese-style valves in the third quarter, so that all products use materials at a ratio of one to two.

    Safe Power Supply Achieves Remote Measurement
    The electromechanical workshop of the Changchun Plywood Factory, after creating an excellent record of safe power supply for nine consecutive years, has also created a power supply safety remote measurement device. It can now know the safety status of the power supply without leaving the power supply room, fundamentally guaranteeing the safety of the power supply.

    Widely Promote Qinghua Experience
    Factories and enterprises in the four cities of Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang in Heilongjiang Province are vigorously studying and promoting the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory in further consolidating and developing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system. Many enterprises have made it possible for cadres to participate in labor in a planned, systematic, and regular manner. Factories have generally strengthened group management, enabling workers to participate in production management, technical management, and cost management, from participating in general daily management.

    Complete Sets of Machine, Pump, and Pipe Production
    The heavy industry system of Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, is earnestly grasping the "machine, pump, and pipe" integrated production of irrigation and drainage equipment. More than 90% of the irrigation and drainage equipment produced this year has been assembled into complete sets, basically achieving the goal of having pumps when there are machines, and pipes when there are pumps, and the complete sets of machines have no missing parts.

    Enthusiastically Help the Backward
    Hua Fujiu, an engineer and Communist Party member from a worker's background at the Hengfeng Textile Equipment Factory in Jiangxi, steps up when there are difficulties and helps the backward. In more than half a year, he has helped twenty-five workers catch up with the advanced. Among them, twelve workers created thirteen tools.
