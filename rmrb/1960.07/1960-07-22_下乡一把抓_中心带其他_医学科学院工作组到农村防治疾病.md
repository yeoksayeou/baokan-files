Grasp Everything Down in the Countryside, Focus on the Center and Lead the Rest
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Work Group Goes to the Countryside to Prevent and Treat Diseases

(Our Newspaper) News: To support agriculture, since the beginning of this year, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has dispatched work groups (teams) to the vast rural areas throughout the country to carry out comprehensive investigations, research, and disease prevention and treatment work, and has achieved significant results.

In order to further support agricultural production, members of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences work groups (teams) have put forward the slogan "Grasp everything down in the countryside, focus on the center and lead the rest." In order to acquire diverse knowledge to meet the current needs of supporting the countryside, all types of personnel first actively learn the "eighteen martial arts" necessary for preventing and treating various diseases and carrying out general health work, and learn while doing. A work group from the Institute of Parasitic Diseases dispatched to the Hainan Island area broke through the limitations of simply engaging in anti-malaria work in the past, and comprehensively cooperated with local health institutions to complete a rapid survey and treatment of three diseases (malaria, filariasis, hookworm disease) in a commune and a farm in thirteen days. The Institute of Occupational Health and Medicine has also listed the research of agricultural labor protection and occupational health as key research projects, including preliminary investigations and studies on chemical fertilizer management and use, prevention of pesticide poisoning, women's health issues in agricultural labor, summarization and improvement of the current rural labor protection system, and heatstroke in the fields, laying the foundation for further in-depth work. The Institute of Pediatrics has helped establish and improve the rural collective child health network, effectively controlling the spread of diseases among collective children. After systematically summarizing and improving various mass innovations in the production of gibberellin using indigenous methods, the Institute of Antibiotics has carried out pilot projects and preliminary promotion in a rural commune.

The relevant research institutes and hospitals have also jointly organized a comprehensive rural health work team. In Changping County, Beijing, they have cooperated with the health campaign and made significant achievements in changing the rural health landscape, harmless treatment of excrement, universal survey and prevention and treatment of common diseases, training of grassroots health cadres, and nutritional health surveys of public canteens. In particular, after vigorously promoting automated manure dilution pools throughout the county in accordance with local conditions, it has not only strongly supported agricultural fertilization, but also created good conditions for improving environmental sanitation, preventing mosquito and fly breeding, and preventing disease transmission.

    下乡一把抓  中心带其他
    医学科学院工作组到农村防治疾病
    本报讯　为了支援农业，今年以来，中国医学科学院向全国广大农村派出工作组（队），开展综合性的调查研究和疾病防治工作。并已取得了显著成绩。
    为了更多的支援农业生产，中国医学科学院各工作组（队）成员，提出了“下乡一把抓，中心带其他”的口号。为了使自己懂得多方面的知识以适应当前支援农村的需要，各类人员首先积极学习防治各种疾病、开展一般卫生工作所必需的“十八般武艺”，并在这个基础上边干边学。寄生虫病研究所派到海南岛地区的一个工作组，打破了过去单纯从事抗疟工作的局限，与当地卫生机构全面协作，以十三天的时间，突击完成了一个公社和一个农场的三病（疟疾、丝虫病、钩虫病）普查普治工作。劳动卫生研究所并把农业劳动保护和劳动卫生的研究列为重点研究项目，其中如化学肥料管理、使用和预防农药中毒、妇女在农业劳动中的卫生问题，农村现行劳动保护制度的总结提高以及田间中暑等，都作了初步调查研究，为进一步深入细致地开展工作打下了基础。儿科研究所帮助建立和健全农村集体儿童保健网，有效地控制了疾病在集体儿童中流行。抗菌素研究所系统总结和提高了群众用土法生产赤霉素的各项创造后，已在一个农村公社进行了试点和初步推广。
    各有关研究所和医院还共同组织了一支综合性农村卫生工作队，他们在北京市昌平县配合卫生运动，在改变农村卫生面貌、粪便无害化处理、普查防治多发病、培训基层卫生干部、公共食堂营养卫生调查等方面，都作出了显著成绩。特别是在全县范围内因地制宜地大搞自动化粪稀池以后，不仅有力支援了农业用肥，而且为改善环境卫生、防止蚊蝇孳生和疾病传染创造了很好条件。　（熊世琦）
