    Heaven Has No End, The Road Has No End
    Ma Tieding
    When Liu Suojin, the production team leader of Shangjie in Liyang County, visited the National Agricultural Exhibition and saw the greater achievements of other mountainous areas in changing their poverty-stricken conditions, it stirred up a thought in his mind: "Looking at home, it's already like chicken feathers flying to the sky, but looking outside, there's still heaven beyond heaven."
    "Chicken feathers flying to the sky" and "heaven beyond heaven" – these two phrases together are truly wonderful!
    The people's cause, the revolutionary cause, the socialist cause – some have already reached the sky, some are on their way to the sky, and some will reach the sky. In a word, sooner or later, they will surely fly to the sky. If anyone doesn't believe in their own power and thinks they should only ever lie on the ground, that's just a philosophy and ideology of cowards.
    And all the enemies of the people, when they can temporarily maintain their rule, when the capital in their hands hasn't been completely lost, always think they are in heaven. In fact, some of them have already fallen, and some are falling, falling all the way to the grave from which they will never recover!
    We often say, "heaven and earth," and heaven is of course much higher than earth. But heaven itself also has different levels; there is heaven beyond heaven.
    In the great cause of socialism and communism, the successful completion of a task and the smooth progress of a work are of course things to be happy about and worth celebrating. However, we must be vigilant against mistakenly thinking in the midst of jubilation that heaven is just this high, that we cannot advance further, and that we no longer need to advance.
    In fact, taking a walk, for example, when we take each step forward, it is merely the temporary end of the old journey, and at the same time the starting point of a new journey. The continuous development of productive forces, the continuous advancement of human society, and the continuous innovation and improvement of ideology and consciousness are all endless.
    Heaven has no end, the road has no end.

    天无止境　路无尽头
    马铁丁
    当溧阳县上街生产队长刘锁金参观了全国农业展览会，看到其他山区改变穷困面貌获得了更大成绩时，勾起了自己一桩心事，这就是：“在家里看看已经是鸡毛飞上天，到外面看看却又是天外还有天。”
    又是“鸡毛飞上天”，又是“天外还有天”，这两句联在一起，真是妙极了！
    人民的事业，革命的事业，社会主义的事业，有的已经上天，有的正在上天，有的将要上天，一句话，或迟或早，一定飞到天上去，如果有人不相信自己的力量，认为自己只应该永远趴在地下，那不过是懦夫哲学、懦夫思想而已。
    而一切人民的敌人，当他们还能暂时维持自己统治的时候，当他们手头的资本还没有输得精光的时候，总是自以为是在天上的。其实，他们之中，有的已经下落，有的正在下落，一直下落到永无翻身之日的坟墓里去！
    我们常说，“天上地下”，天当然是比地高得多的。但是，天的本身，也是有高低之分的，天外还有天。
    在整个社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业中，一个任务的大功告成，一件工作的顺利开展，当然都是应该高兴，值得高兴的。但是，要警惕在兴高采烈中误以为：天就是这末高，不能再前进了，也不再需要前进了。
    其实，譬如走路，当我们每向前跨进一步，那不过是：旧行程的暂时终结，而同时又是新行程的起点。生产力的不断发展，人类社会的不断前进，思想意识的不断革新和提高，都是永无止境的。
    天无止境，路无尽头。
