Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from New Delhi: Indian central government employees who participated in the strike are being persecuted.

According to reports from the Indian News Service based on messages received from various parts of India, many striking government employees received orders of dismissal, suspension, or summons when they returned to work. In many cases, local officials insisted that employees submit written letters of repentance before allowing them to return to their positions. According to the Press Trust of India, none of the 9,000 government employees in Calcutta who were suspended or received dismissal notices from the authorities for participating in the strike have been allowed to return to their jobs.

In a statement issued yesterday, the All-India Trade Union Congress called on all workers, trade unions, and friends of the working class to "raise funds to relieve the central government employees and provide them with legal assistance." The statement said, "The heroic actions of the central government employees have won widespread approval and support from workers in all sectors and the general public."

The statement said, "The strike of the central government employees has now been called off. The government, wielding its power of repression, spared no effort in using the military to suppress the strike, arresting more than 15,000 workers. Hundreds of people have already been subjected to retaliation. Thousands of employees have been suspended, and the number of dismissed employees has reached four figures. A large number of employees, especially those who have been arrested, are awaiting the same fate. [The government] is issuing summonses and taking other punitive measures against workers who went on strike. The maximum penalty of one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of one thousand rupees stipulated by the hated Essential Services Maintenance Ordinance has been imposed on the workers. In addition, several fabricated cases accusing workers and trade union personnel of so-called sabotage have been concocted. The trade union movement has never been subjected to such brutal repression in the past."

The Press Trust of India reported that the Bihar branch of the All-India Trade Union Congress has arranged legal defense for all those who have been "prosecuted" because of the strike. Seventeen lawyers in Patna have agreed to defend the employees.

According to today's "Indian Express," the government employees' strike, according to preliminary estimates, cost the government and other sectors 250 million rupees. The newspaper said, "The government has to pay a large amount of money to deal with the emergency situation, as it has to deploy troops and police, recruit replacement personnel, and make other arrangements." According to the newspaper's estimate, the government had to spend 20 million rupees per day during the strike.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch from New Delhi: Despite the decision by the Joint Action Committee of Central Government Employees Unions on the 16th to unconditionally end the strike, workers in some parts of India still refused to go to work on the 17th. According to the Press Trust of India, in Madurai, Madras State, some railway, telephone, and telegraph office workers had not reported to work by the morning of the 17th.

The newspaper also reported that the Indian Cabinet will hold a meeting today to study the situation after the strike.

According to Indian newspapers, People's Socialist Party leaders, Peter Alvares (General Secretary of the committee), S.M. Joshi, and Nath Pai, members of the Joint Action Committee of Central Government Employees Unions, were released from prison in Bombay on the 17th. In a statement issued in prison, they expressed their agreement with the decision made by other members of the Joint Action Committee after consulting with Mehta regarding the cessation of the strike.

It is reported that Mehta, the leader of the People's Socialist Party, continued to hold talks with Home Minister Pant, Finance Minister Desai, Labor Minister Nanda, and Transport Minister Subbarayan on the 17th regarding the strike.

According to the "Hindustan Times," those who participated in the strike will be charged with "crimes of intimidation, coercion, and violence," and they will be held responsible for their actions. The newspaper said, "This means dismissing these people."

A dispatch from the Press Trust of India on the 18th said that approximately 9,000 government employees in Calcutta have been declared ineligible for their original positions; they have either been suspended or dismissed. Another 1,000 people have been accused of "violating the law" and are under investigation.

Ramamurti, Vice Chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, and Raji Bahadur Gaur, Secretary, issued statements on the 17th, demanding that the government rescind the measures taken against the striking employees and strike leaders and release all those arrested.

　　印度政府大肆迫害罢工雇员
　　成千成万雇员受到当局逮捕传讯开除解雇和罚款
　  全印工会大会呼吁各界人士为罢工雇员提供援助
    新华社19日讯　新德里消息，参加这次罢工的印度中央政府雇员正在遭到迫害。
    据印度新闻社根据从印度各地接到的消息报道，许多罢工的政府雇员复工时，接到了开除和停职的命令或传票，地方官员在许多情况下还坚持要雇员提交书面悔过书，然后才允许他们复职。据印度报业托辣斯说，在加尔各答，由于参加罢工而被当局停职或接到当局的解雇通知的九千名政府雇员中，没有一个人被准许复职。
    全印工会大会在昨天发表的一个声明中，呼吁所有的工人、工会和工人阶级的朋友们“募捐经费来救济中央政府的雇员并向他们提供法律上的援助”。声明说，“中央政府雇员的英雄行动已经获得了各部门工人和一般人民的广泛赞成和支持。”
    声明说，“中央政府雇员的罢工现在已经撤消了。拥有高压权力的政府不遗余力地用军队镇压罢工，逮捕了一万五千多名工人。数以百计的人已经遭到报复。数以千计的雇员已经被停职，被开除的雇员的人数已经达到四位数字。大批雇员，特别是那些被捕的人，等待着同样的命运，（政府）正在对进行罢工的工人发出传票和采取其他惩罚措施。受人痛恨的重要服务事业维持法令所规定的一年严酷的徒刑和一千卢比罚款这个最高处罚，已经强加在工人头上。此外，以所谓破坏的罪名，虚构了好几起控诉工人和工会人员的案件。工会运动过去从来没有遭到过这样残暴镇压。”
    印度报业托辣斯报道说，全印工会大会比哈尔邦分会已经为一切由于罢工而“受到起诉”的人安排法律辩护。巴特那的十七名律师已同意为雇员进行辩护。
    据今天的“印度快报”报道，这次政府雇员罢工，据初步估计，使政府和其它方面损失两亿五千万卢比。这家报纸说，“政府必须支付大量的钱来应付紧急状态，因为它必须部署军队和警察，召募替代人员和进行其他的安排”。据报纸估计，在罢工期间，只是政府每天就得支出两千万卢比。
    新华社18日讯　新德里消息：尽管中央政府雇员工会联合行动委员会在16日作出了无条件停止罢工的决定，印度有些地方的职工17日仍然拒绝上班。据印度报业托辣斯报道，马德拉斯邦的马都莱，一些铁路、电话、电报局职工在17日上午还没有报到。
    报纸还报道，印度内阁将在今天举行会议来研究罢工后的局势。
    据印度报纸报道，人民社会党领袖、中央政府雇员工会联合行动委员会的成员彼得·阿尔瓦雷斯（委员会总书记）、斯·麦·乔希和纳特·帕伊已经在17日从孟买的监狱中获释。他们在监狱中发表谈话，表示同意联合行动委员会其他成员在同梅达商量后作出的关于停止罢工的决定。
    据报道，人民社会党的头子梅达17日同内政部长潘特、财政部长德赛、劳工部长南达、交通运输部长苏巴拉延继续就罢工问题举行会谈。
    据“印度斯坦时报”说，参加罢工的人将被控“犯有恫吓、胁迫和暴行罪”，他们要对自己的行动负责。报纸说，“这意味着要把这些人解雇”。
    印度报业托辣斯18日的消息说，加尔各答政府雇员中大约有九千人已经被宣布不能获得原职，他们不是被停职就是被解雇。另外有一千人被控“破坏法律”，正在对他们进行审查。
    全印工会大会副主席拉马穆蒂和书记腊季·巴哈杜尔·高尔17日发表谈话，要求政府取消对参加罢工的雇员和罢工的领导者所采取的措施，并且释放所有被捕的人。
