Xinhua News Agency, July 19th dispatch from Léopoldville: Congolese soldiers and civilians continue to persist in their struggle, fighting back against the imperialists' armed provocations.

　　In Thysville, more than one hundred kilometers south of Léopoldville, after shooting down and damaging three invading Belgian military aircraft on the 17th, the Congolese army repelled a Belgian force attempting to seize the city on the 18th, firmly holding their positions. On the same day, local Congolese soldiers also used heavy machine guns to wound an American aircraft that took off from Brazzaville (French Congo) and intruded into Congolese airspace.

　　According to reports, U.S. helicopters based in Brazzaville (French Congo), under the pretext of "rescuing white people," continuously flew into Congolese airspace throughout the 18th. One of them flew as far as Fanga and Kikwit, 250 miles inland; one did not return to Brazzaville by night and was expected to spend the night in the Congo. The helicopter hit by Congolese troops was helping the Belgian invading forces search for a Belgian-made "Harvard" reconnaissance plane, which had been shot down by Congolese soldiers. The helicopter was hit eight times by Congolese soldiers' bullets, and the rotor was also damaged.

　　Reports say that despite this incident, U.S. helicopters are still carrying out their "missions" in the Lower Congo area, provoking the heroic Congolese soldiers and civilians.

　　In the port of Matadi in Lower Congo, after repeatedly repelling large numbers of invading Belgian paratroopers, the heroic Congolese soldiers and civilians continue to remain vigilant, ready to strike at the invading Belgian aggressors at any time.

　　According to reports, on the 17th, in Bannenville, northeast of the Congolese capital Léopoldville, Congolese troops engaged in fierce fighting with invading Belgian paratroopers.

　　Sources say that the Congolese Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution on the 18th demanding that the Belgian colonial army leave the Republic of the Congo within twelve hours. On the same day, the Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, Lumumba, wrote a letter to the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, the American Bunch, who was staying in the Congo, asking the United Nations forces to order the Belgian colonial army to withdraw from the Congo completely by the 19th. However, according to Western news agencies, Bunch brazenly rejected Lumumba's request that same day.

　　At the same time, the imperialists are stepping up their conspiracy to split Congolese territory. Under their planning, the Katanga provincial authorities, disregarding the opposition of the Congolese people and the Congolese central government, actually demanded on the 18th that the United Nations "recognize" the "independence" of the province within forty-eight hours.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 19th dispatch from New York: United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld released a report on the implementation of the United Nations Security Council's resolution to send troops to the Congo on the 18th.

　　Hammarskjöld's report said that by the time he drafted the report, 3,500 United Nations troops had arrived in Léopoldville. The report emphasized that the United Nations forces in the Congo "must enjoy freedom of movement, be able to enter areas necessary to carry out this mission, and obtain the necessary means of transportation."

　　The report pointed out that these troops are being dispersed to strategic points and areas of dangerous tension "as quickly as possible." They have been sent to Stanleyville, Matadi, Thysville, and Coquilhatville in the Congo.

　　The report pointed out that the United Nations forces will become a "temporary security force" in the Congo, assuming the "role of restoring peace and order," and that it "cannot be commanded by the Congolese government" and cannot "cooperate with the Congolese government in any joint action."

　　The report also stated that the establishment of the United Nations forces needs to "reach a scale far exceeding what has been achieved before." It said that in principle, African countries should provide the first batch of military aid, and after the completion of the first phase, requests for troops have subsequently been made to three European countries, one Asian country, and one Latin American country.

　　When the report mentioned the United Nations Security Council's resolution requiring Belgium to withdraw its troops from the Congo, it did not specify when or whether the Belgian troops intended to withdraw. On the contrary, the report stated that after the United Nations forces arrived in Léopoldville, "a company and a platoon of Belgian troops have left Léopoldville. This batch of troops is under the control of the commander of the Belgian home forces and is prepared to go to other places where (Belgians) request assistance where the United Nations forces do not go." Moreover, the report also stated that the Belgian ambassador has written to the United Nations representative in the Congo, threatening that "in the event of a serious and urgent situation, Belgian troops will continue to take the necessary security measures."

　　Hammarskjöld has requested the Security Council to hold a meeting to discuss his report. The Congolese representative to the United Nations, Kanza, left Léopoldville yesterday to go to New York to attend the meeting.

　　刚果军民激烈战斗抗击比军
　　美国飞机挑衅活动频繁　刚果士兵击伤美机一架
　　联合国美籍副秘书长本奇拒绝卢蒙巴总理关于比军撤离刚果的要求
    新华社19日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民继续坚持斗争，反击帝国主义者的武装挑衅。
    在利奥波德维尔以南一百多公里的太斯维尔，刚果军队继17日击落击伤三架入侵的比利时军用飞机之后，18日又击退了一支企图侵占这座城市的比利时军队，牢牢地守住了自己的阵地。同天，当地的刚果士兵还用重机枪打伤了一架从布拉柴维尔起飞侵入刚果领空的美国飞机。
    据报道，以（法属）刚果的布拉柴维尔为基地的美国直升飞机在18日借口“营救白人”整天不断地飞入刚果领空。其中，有一架一直飞到二百五十英里的内地范加和基奎特；有一架到夜晚还没有回到布拉柴维尔，预计将在刚果过夜。被刚果部队击中的那架直升飞机，是帮助比利时侵略军寻找被刚果士兵打落的一架比利时的美制“哈佛式”侦察机的。这架直升飞机八次为刚果士兵的子弹所击中，旋转翼也受了伤。
    消息说，尽管发生了这个事件，美国直升飞机仍然在下刚果一带执行他们的“任务”，向英勇的刚果军民挑衅。
    在下刚果的马塔迪港，英勇的刚果军民在多次打退入侵的大量比利时伞兵后，继续保持着警惕，准备随时打击来犯的比利时侵略军。
    据报道，17日在刚果首都利奥波德维尔东北的班南维尔，刚果军队曾同入侵的比利时伞兵展开了激烈的战斗。
    有消息说，刚果众议院在18日通过一项决议，要求比利时殖民军在十二小时内离开刚果共和国。同一天，刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴曾写信给呆在刚果的联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇，要联合国部队命令比利时殖民军在19日以前全部撤离刚果。但是，据西方通讯社报道，本奇当天就悍然拒绝了卢蒙巴的要求。
    在这同时，帝国主义者加紧进行分裂刚果领土的阴谋活动。在他们的策划下，加丹加省当局不顾刚果人民和刚果中央政府的反对，18日竟要求联合国在四十八小时内
  “承认”这个省的“独立”。
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德18日发表了关于联合国安全理事会派军队到刚果去的决议执行情况的报告。
    哈马舍尔德的报告说，到他草拟这个报告时为止，已经有三千五百名联合国部队到达利奥波德维尔。报告强调，在刚果的联合国部队“必须享有行动自由，能够进入执行这项任务所必须进入的地区以及取得必要的交通工具”。
    报告指出这些部队正在以“尽一切可能的速度”分散到战略要点和危险的紧张地区去。他们已经被派到刚果的斯坦利维尔、马塔迪、太斯维尔和科基尔哈特维尔去。
    报告指出，联合国部队将成为在刚果的“临时保安部队”，担任“恢复和平与秩序的角色”，它“不能受刚果政府指挥”，也不能“同刚果政府合作进行任何联合行动”。
    报告还说，需要使联合国部队的建立“达到远远超过前所达到的规模”。它说原则上应该由非洲国家提供第一批军事援助，而在第一阶段完成以后，已经随后向三个欧洲国家、一个亚洲国家和一个拉丁美洲国家要求军队。
    报告在谈到联合国安全理事会要求比利时从刚果撤出军队的决议时，没有说明比利时军队究竟什么时候撤退以及是否打算撤退。相反地，报告说，联合国部队到达利奥波德维尔后，“已有相当于一连又一排的比利时部队离开利奥波德维尔，这批部队由比利时本国部队的司令官支配，准备到联合国部队不去的其他（比利时人）要求援助的地方去。”而且，报告还说，比利时大使已经写信给联合国在刚果的代表，扬言“万一发生了严重和燃眉之急的情况，比利时部队将继续采取必要的安全措施”。
    哈马舍尔德已经要求安理会举行会议来讨论他的报告，刚果驻联合国代表坎扎昨天离开利奥波德维尔到纽约去参加这次会议。
