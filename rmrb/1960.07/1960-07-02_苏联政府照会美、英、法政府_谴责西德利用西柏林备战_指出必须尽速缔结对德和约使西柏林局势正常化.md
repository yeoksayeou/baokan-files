Xinhua News Agency, July 1st, TASS Moscow, June 30th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin received U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thompson on June 30th and handed him the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government regarding the Federal Republic of Germany's use of West Berlin for war preparations. On the same day, Firyubin also received British Ambassador to Moscow Reilly and French Ambassador to Moscow Dejean, handing them notes identical in content from the Soviet government to the British and French governments.

The full text of the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government on June 30th is as follows:

The Soviet government considers it necessary to draw the attention of the U.S. government to the following situation.

The Soviet government has learned that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is attempting to use West Berlin for war preparations. Authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany are actively recruiting citizens of this city to join the West German army within West Berlin. Numerous military and political institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany have been established in West Berlin, responsible for registering persons fit for military service and recruiting them into the Federal Defense Forces. Moreover, in order to transport the recruited personnel, the transportation routes between Berlin and West Germany are being illegally used, even though everyone knows that these transportation routes were opened for other purposes. West Berlin residents who have completed their service in the West German army have established various kinds of associations and "fraternities," which are, in fact, reserve detachments of the Federal Defense Forces in West Berlin. Moreover, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is even attempting to subordinate the economy of West Berlin to the interests of arming West Germany. On January 8, 1960, a federal law was implemented in West Berlin, according to which the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has the right to obligate enterprises in West Berlin to fulfill military orders.

The Soviet government has reminded the U.S. government of the provocative activities of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany in West Berlin, which is located on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, has never belonged to, and will never belong in the future, to the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and cannot be administered by the organs of the Federal government. The new facts show that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has not only not stopped these activities, but that they have taken on an increasingly dangerous and provocative nature.

It is quite obvious that the actions now being taken by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to include West Berlin within the scope of its militaristic measures are aimed solely at further increasing the tension in Berlin and Germany and leading matters to a dangerous conflict. All of this once again convincingly proves that it is necessary to conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible and, on this basis, to normalize the situation in West Berlin.

In view of the above, the Soviet government expects that the U.S. government (which declares that it is now jointly responsible with the British and French governments for the situation in West Berlin) can end the attempts of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to use West Berlin for war preparations and take measures to prevent such illegal actions by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    苏联政府照会美、英、法政府
    谴责西德利用西柏林备战
    指出必须尽速缔结对德和约使西柏林局势正常化
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：苏联外交部副部长费留宾在6月30日接见了美国驻莫斯科大使汤普森，把苏联政府就德意志联邦共和国利用西柏林来进行战争准备一事给美国政府的照会交给了他。在同一天，费留宾还接见了英国驻莫斯科大使赖利和法国驻莫斯科大使德让，把苏联政府给英、法两国政府的内容相同的照会交给了他们。
    苏联政府6月30日给美国政府的照会全文如下：
    苏联政府认为有必要促请美国政府注意下列情况。
    苏联政府获悉，德意志联邦共和国政府企图利用西柏林进行备战活动。德意志联邦共和国当局在西柏林境内积极招募这个城市的市民参加西德军队。在西柏林建立了许多德意志联邦共和国的军政机构负责登记适合服兵役的人，并招募他们参加联邦国防军。而且，为了运送已经招募到的兵员，非法地利用了柏林和西德之间的交通线，可是大家知道，这条交通线是为了其他目的而开辟的。在西德军队中服役期满的西柏林居民建立了形形色色的联合会和“联谊会”，这些组织实际上是联邦国防军在西柏林的后备支队。而且，德意志联邦共和国政府甚至试图使西柏林的经济服从于武装西德的利益。1960年1月8日，有一项联邦法律推行到西柏林，根据这项法律，德意志联邦共和国政府有权使西柏林的企业承担完成军事定货的义务。
    苏联政府曾经提醒美国政府注意德意志联邦共和国政府对西柏林的挑衅活动，西柏林是位于德意志民主共和国领土上的，它从来不属于、而且今后也不属于德意志联邦共和国的版图，而且不能由联邦政府的机关来管理。新的事实说明，德意志联邦共和国政府不仅没有停止这种活动，而且这种活动具有越来越危险的挑衅性质。
    十分明显，德意志联邦共和国政府现在所采取的企图把西柏林列入自己军国主义措施范围内的作法，其目的只是要使柏林和德国的形势更加紧张，把事情导致危险的冲突。所有这一切再一次令人信服地证明，必须尽速缔结对德和约并在这个基础上使西柏林局势正常化。
    鉴于以上所述，苏联政府期望，美国政府（它声明现在同英法两国对西柏林局势共同负责）能结束德意志联邦共和国政府想利用西柏林来进行战争准备的企图，并采取措施防止德意志联邦共和国政府这种违法行动。
