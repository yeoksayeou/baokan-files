Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th Dispatch: The soon-to-be-downfall Japanese traitorous Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated on the 9th that he would support his partner, current Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, in the Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election, attempting to maintain his control over the next cabinet.

According to Tokyo Radio: Nobusuke Kishi told Yuzo Shigemune, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's House of Councillors, on the 9th: When Foreign Minister Fujiyama participates in the Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election, you must cooperate with him. Shigemune later said: He had been "entrusted by Prime Minister Kishi to concentrate the votes of the Liberal Democratic Party's senators on Foreign Minister Fujiyama." Shigemune believes that Nobusuke Kishi has clearly indicated his support for Fujiyama's candidacy for the Liberal Democratic Party presidency and decided to contact Tsuruhei Matsuno, Speaker of the House of Councillors, immediately.

Nobusuke Kishi originally intended to decide on his preferred candidate for the next prime minister through private activities to maintain his power. However, Shojiro Kawashima announced on the 9th that the "adjustment work" of electing the prime minister first and then the Liberal Democratic Party president, which had been carried out repeatedly in recent days, had reached a deadlock. According to Tokyo Radio, current Minister of International Trade and Industry Hayato Ikeda, Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Banboku Ohno, Chairman of the General Council Mitsujiro Ishii, and "anti-mainstream" leader Kenzo Matsumura formally expressed their determination to run for the Liberal Democratic Party presidency on the 9th. According to United Press International, the fact that Liberal Democratic Party leaders were unable to reach a consensus on the next prime minister shows that the ruling party does not want to dissolve the Diet in the near future. The factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party for the next president and prime minister has become increasingly fierce. It is reported that Ichiro Kono of the "anti-mainstream faction" has decided to support the Ohno and Ishii factions in the presidential election at the Liberal Democratic Party's extraordinary convention on the 13th. Kono also plans to meet with Matsumura, Ohno, Ishii, and others to strengthen ties.

Nippon Hoso Kyokai Radio pointed out that the nomination of five candidates for president by various factions of the Liberal Democratic Party will cause considerable turmoil.

　　力图保持对下届内阁的控制
　　岸信介决定支持藤山竞选执政党下届总裁
　　自由民主党内各派系争夺下届党政首脑的斗争日趋激烈
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：即将下台的日本卖国首相岸信介9日表示要支持他的伙伴、现任外务相藤山爱一郎竞选自由民主党总裁，企图保持自己对下届内阁的控制力量。
    据东京电台报道：岸信介9日对自由民主党参议院议员会会长重宗雄三说：当藤山外务相参加自由民主党总裁竞选时，你要和他合作。重宗雄三事后说：他已经“受到岸（信介）首相的委托，要把自由民主党参议员的选票集中在藤山外相身上”。重宗雄三认为，岸信介已经明确表明推举藤山竞选自由民主党总裁，决定立即同参议院议长松野鹤平取得联系。
    岸信介原来打算通过私下的活动决定他所中意的下届首相的人选，以保持他的势力。但是，川岛正次郎9日宣布，连日来反复进行的先选首相后选自由民主党总裁的“调整工作”已经陷于僵局。据东京电台报道，现任通商产业相池田勇人、外相藤山爱一郎、自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦、总务会长石井光次郎、“反主流派”领袖松村谦三等已经在9日正式表明竞选自由民主党总裁的决心。据合众国际社透露，自由民主党首脑们没有能够在下届首相人选上取得一致意见，这件事说明执政党不想在最近期间解散国会。自由民主党内部争夺下届总裁和首相职位的派系斗争趋于白热化。据报道，“反主流派”的河野一郎已经决定在13日举行的自由民主党临时大会上，支持大野和石井派竞选总裁。河野还打算会见松村、大野、石井等人，加强联系。
    日本广播协会电台指出，由于自由民主党各派推举出五个人竞选总裁，将引起相当大的风波。
