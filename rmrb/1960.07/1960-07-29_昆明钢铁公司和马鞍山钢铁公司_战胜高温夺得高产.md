Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Dispatch: Since entering the rainy and high-temperature month of July, the production level of Kunming Iron and Steel Company has continued to rise significantly. The company's steel output in the first and second ten-day periods of July increased by 53% compared to the same period last month, and steel production increased by 110%.

After entering the hot and rainy season, the company's employees not only adopted various effective measures to overcome the difficulties brought about by the bad weather, but also tried every means to better improve the quality of steel. The employees of the Ironmaking Plant always insisted on eliminating the "three pests" (large pieces, gangue, and fine ore), ensuring that the fine ore was sintered well before being charged into the furnace, and insisted on baking limestone before charging it into the furnace, ensuring that the blast furnace was well-fed; at the same time, they also focused on blast furnace operation, insisted on making alkaline slag, and insisted on fixed air volume and fixed air temperature, thereby ensuring stable furnace conditions and improved desulfurization effect. After the employees of the Steelmaking Plant took measures such as strengthening material yard management, insisting on weighing each batch of ingredients, and improving the operation of the iron melting furnace, the quality of the steel was greatly improved. The pass rate of steel in the first and second ten-day periods increased from 83% in June to 91%.

In the mass movement to promote high quality and high yield, the company's leaders at all levels continued to carry forward the excellent style of "four togethers." They went deep into the front line of production, and practically solved the key problems in production, achieving the convergence of four levels of cadres from the company, factory, workshop, and squad at the furnace side, eating and sleeping on site, and discussing matters with the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: The vast number of employees of Anhui Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company have achieved the success of "the middle ten days are redder than the first ten days." Compared with the first ten days of July, pig iron increased by 3.56%, steel increased by 0.86%, steel products increased by 6.96%, and coke increased by 5.82%. The quality of products is also constantly improving. Among them, the qualified rate of pig iron in the first Iron Plant in the middle ten days increased by 3% compared with the first ten days; the first-class product rate of the second Steel Plant increased by 7.78%.

Since mid-July, steel plants have further carried out the "Hundred Furnaces Longevity" campaign. The employees of the first workshop of the first plant, in production, selected good materials, made good slag, controlled the amount of molten iron charged, and strictly implemented the post responsibility system and operating procedures, so that the furnace age reached seventy-eight furnaces, creating the highest record of furnace age since the city had steelmaking furnaces. The vast number of employees of the Second Steel Plant warmly responded to the call of the Party Committee, and the cadres went deep into the front line of production, selected the first-class raw materials, and selected the top operators, ensuring the first-class product rate of steel.

In the production process, all factories and mines carried forward the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration. The first workshop of the first Iron Plant kept the temperature of the molten iron above 1,300 degrees Celsius, reducing the sulfur and silicon content, creating favorable conditions for the steelworkers to shorten the smelting time. In order to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed, the employees of Gushan Iron Mine successfully tested a new blasting method, which increased the output and quality of ore and greatly reduced production costs.

    战胜高温夺得高产
    新华社昆明电　昆明钢铁公司进入多雨高温的7月份以来，生产水平继续大幅度上升。全公司7月上旬和中旬的钢产量比上月同期提高了53％，钢材产量提高了110％。
    全公司职工进入高温多雨的季节以后，不仅采取多种有效措施战胜了坏天气所带来的困难，而且多方设法，更好地提高了钢铁的质量。炼铁厂的职工，始终坚持了除“三害”（大块、夹石、粉矿），做到粉矿烧结好以后再入炉，并且坚持石灰石烘烧入炉，保证了高炉吃饱、吃好；同时，他们还狠抓高炉操作，坚持造碱性渣，坚持定风量和定风温，从而保证了炉况稳定，提高了脱硫效果。炼钢厂的职工采取加强料场管理、坚持配料批批过秤、改进化铁炉操作等措施以后，钢的质量有了大幅度提高，上旬和中旬钢的合格率由6月份的83％提高到91％。
    在促进优质高产的群众运动中，这个公司的各级领导干部继续发扬了“四同”的优良作风。他们深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地解决生产中的关键问题，做到了公司、厂、车间、大班四级干部会师炉边，吃睡在现场，遇事跟群众同商量。
    新华社合肥电　安徽马鞍山钢铁公司的广大职工，夺得了“中旬更比上旬红”的成绩。7月中旬与上旬相比，生铁增长3.56％，钢增产0.86％，钢材增长6.96％，焦炭增长5.82％。产品质量也不断提高。其中一铁厂中旬的生铁合格率比上旬提高3％；二钢厂一级品率提高7.78％。
    中旬以来，各钢厂进一步开展了“百炉长寿”运动。一厂一车间的职工们，在生产中做到了选好料、造好渣、控制铁水装入量，严格执行岗位责任制和操作规程，使炉龄达到了七十八炉，创造了全市有炼钢炉以来炉龄的最高纪录。二钢厂广大职工热烈响应党委的号召，干部深入生产第一线，原料选送第一等，操作选第一把手，保证了钢的一级品率。
    在生产过程中，各厂矿发扬了共产主义大协作精神。一铁厂一车间使铁水温度经常保持在一千三百度以上，减低含硫含矽成分，为炼钢工人缩短冶炼时间创造了有利条件。姑山铁矿职工为了使高炉吃饱吃好，试验成功了新的爆破方法，提高了矿石的产量和质量，大大降低了生产成本。
