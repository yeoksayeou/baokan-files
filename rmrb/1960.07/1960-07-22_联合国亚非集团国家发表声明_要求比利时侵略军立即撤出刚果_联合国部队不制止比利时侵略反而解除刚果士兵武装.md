Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, New York: The United Nations Afro-Asian group of twenty-nine nations issued a statement on the 20th, demanding the complete and immediate withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo.

The statement also called for the maintenance of the Congo's territorial integrity and opposed violations of the Congo's territorial integrity.

The statement was adopted by the Afro-Asian group at a meeting before the Security Council met again on the evening of the 20th to discuss the situation in the Congo. The statement said that the Afro-Asian group held a meeting on the 20th and listened to the statement of the Congolese delegation. "The general consensus advocates the immediate withdrawal of all Belgian troops from the Republic of the Congo."

The statement also said, "The Afro-Asian group is also deeply convinced of the urgent need to maintain the territorial integrity of this new republic and regrets the actions of certain elements endangering [the Congo's] territorial integrity."

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Leopoldville: Congolese soldiers and civilians are valiantly resisting the Belgian aggressor troops throughout the country to defend their national independence. At the same time, however, some United Nations troops commanded by United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche, an American, and European officers, are stepping up the occupation of Congolese army camps and disarming them.

According to reports, in Bunia, near Uganda in the northeastern part of Congo's Orientale Province, the Congolese army resisted invading Belgian paratroopers on the 19th. In a fierce battle, the Congolese army killed two Belgian colonial soldiers and wounded one. In Lokandu, in the northern part of Congo's Kivu Province, the Congolese people's armed forces also captured two Belgian officers and eleven soldiers in a battle to repel a Belgian paratrooper unit.

Reports indicate that the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against colonialism is continuing to develop in depth in Kasongo in Kivu Province and many places in Orientale Province.

However, according to a United Nations spokesman in Leopoldville on the 20th, after occupying the Congolese army barracks in Leopoldville and Thysville, the United Nations forces, again under the pretext of "maintaining order," entered the port of Matadi on the 20th, which the Congolese army had bravely repelled attacking Belgian forces several times and had been firmly defending. In fact, the order in this important city, which the Belgian army failed to seize, was very good. The United Nations spokesman himself said: The United Nations forces entering the port of Matadi found that the port facilities were almost completely untouched, the cranes were working as usual, the breakwaters were not damaged, and the oil loading and unloading pumps were intact.

Other reports say that the United Nations forces, which had earlier occupied the Hardy camp in Thysville, had disarmed the Congolese army. Two other United Nations forces have been dispatched to Coquilhatville, the capital of Equateur Province, and Watsa in Orientale Province.

There is no news that the United Nations forces have taken similar actions against the Belgian aggressor troops. However, according to reports, around the time the United Nations forces entered the Congo, Belgian colonial troops carried out armed interventions against the Congolese people in twenty-four locations in the Congo. Congolese Minister of Information Kashamura condemned the atrocities of the Belgian colonialists in a radio broadcast on the 19th. He announced that Africans from places such as Kasongo and Kindu had complained that they had been subjected to the most shameful and barbaric acts of abuse by those who call themselves "civilized people" (colonists). He also said that the Belgians said that the Congolese army raped white women, but on the contrary, it was the Belgian colonialists who raped African women.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Leopoldville: Since the entry of United Nations forces into the Congo, the number of Belgian aggressor troops there has not decreased, but has increased further. The United Nations Secretary-General's special representative in the Congo, the American Ralph Bunche, openly announced that the mission of this United Nations force is to "assist in restoring order." While maintaining cooperation with the Belgian aggressor troops, the United Nations forces are constantly taking over areas guarded by the Congolese army.

The United Nations force began to enter the Congo after United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche was appointed interim commander on July 15th. At that time, the Belgian troops sent to the Congo to suppress the people's struggle were announced to be twenty-three companies. By the 20th, the Belgian Ministry of Defense announced that the aggressor troops it had sent to the Congo numbered twenty-nine companies, that is, six companies had been added in less than five days.

A Belgian government spokesman said on the 20th in Brussels, the Belgian capital, that Belgium was ready to continue sending troops to the Congo at any time, as long as it deemed it "necessary." The spokesman also said that Belgium "has the right and the obligation" to ensure that Europeans in the Congo receive "protection."

The report on the United Nations' dispatch of troops to the Congo, submitted by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld on the 18th, did not mention at all how to implement the Security Council's resolution demanding that Belgium withdraw its troops from the Congo. He cited a letter from the Belgian ambassador to Bunche saying: "In the event of serious and urgent situations, Belgian troops will continue to take the necessary security measures."

Many reports indicate that there is close cooperation between the Belgian aggressor troops and the United Nations forces. At a press conference in Leopoldville on the 20th, someone asked Bunche whether Belgium was cooperating with the United Nations. Bunche replied: "Yes."

The following things also reflect the relationship between the United Nations forces and the Belgian army:

Belgium emphasizes that the mission of the United Nations forces is to maintain so-called "order" in the Congo and to "guarantee" the "safety" of Belgians and Europeans. Bunche also said in a statement issued to the Congolese capital press on the 20th that the United Nations forces would "assume the responsibility of maintaining [Congolese] law and order"; "Providing full guarantees to all residents (including European and African residents) is the current deepest concern of United Nations activities here."

Everyone knows that British General Alexander, who participated in the United Nations force, and Swedish General von Horn, the current commander of the United Nations forces, both met with Belgian military officials, the Belgian ambassador, and the American ambassador, among others, upon their arrival in the Congo. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Leopoldville on the 16th, on the day of von Horn's arrival in Leopoldville, the United Nations forces reached an agreement with the Belgian forces, "precisely defining the 'spheres of influence' of the various armed forces." The news said that Belgian officers and United Nations forces officers "held a meeting at the city center operations headquarters for this matter." Then, the United Nations forces began to occupy certain "strongholds" assigned to them.

Belgian colonial troops had frantically clamored for Congolese armed soldiers to lay down their weapons, and British United Nations forces officer Alexander immediately demanded that Congolese soldiers hand over their weapons upon his arrival in the Congo.

Currently, in several famous cities where the Congolese army and civilians bravely resisted the invaders, United Nations forces have been assigned to occupy or "take over" command of the Congolese army. Reports say that Bunche and von Horn have repeatedly held talks with the Congolese government to discuss the "peaceful takeover" of the Congo.

The Leopoldville radio station building and the Congolese army headquarters' Leopold II camp were among the first to be occupied by the United Nations forces after the arrival of Generals Alexander and von Horn. According to news reports on the 19th, the United Nations forces occupying the camp disarmed the Congolese army there. Currently, the Leopoldville airport is also controlled by the United Nations forces.

After this, Belgian forces announced their withdrawal from the Leopoldville area, but reports say that these forces will only move to Belgian military bases in Katanga Province.

At the same time, United Nations forces are actively intervening in places in the interior of the Congo where people are rising up against the colonialists. Reports say that the United Nations Secretary-General has requested that a United Nations force be sent to Watsa in northeastern Congo to help the colonialists who have been provoked and retaliated against by the local people.

A United Nations force dispatched to Thysville, where Congolese soldiers and civilians resolutely resisted the Belgian aggressor troops, occupied the Congolese army's Hardy camp there on the 18th and "took over" command of the Congolese army personnel there, disarming the Congolese army. According to Western news agencies, when the United Nations force went to occupy the camp, it was resisted by Congolese soldiers.

Belgian colonialists have repeatedly demanded that United Nations forces occupy the port of Matadi, the Congo's largest seaport, where the Congolese army and civilians have bravely defeated Belgian aggressor troops many times. An Associated Press dispatch from Leopoldville on the 20th said that a United Nations force had entered the seaport on the 20th.

It has been announced that as of the 20th, more than three thousand United Nations troops have arrived in the Congo. But Bunche said that he had been assured that the number would exceed ten thousand by the end of the week.

The United States has not nominally sent troops to participate in the United Nations force, but a United Press International report on the 19th said that officials estimate that about fifty U.S. Army and Air Force personnel are now serving on the ground in the Congo. This number does not include the crew members of the dozens of Air Force aircraft participating in the transportation effort.
