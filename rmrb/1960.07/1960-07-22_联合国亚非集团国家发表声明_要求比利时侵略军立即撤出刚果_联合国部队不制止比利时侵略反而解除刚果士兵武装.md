Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, New York: The United Nations Afro-Asian group of twenty-nine nations issued a statement on the 20th, demanding the complete and immediate withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo.

The statement also called for the maintenance of the Congo's territorial integrity and opposed violations of the Congo's territorial integrity.

The statement was adopted by the Afro-Asian group at a meeting before the Security Council met again on the evening of the 20th to discuss the situation in the Congo. The statement said that the Afro-Asian group held a meeting on the 20th and listened to the statement of the Congolese delegation. "The general consensus advocates the immediate withdrawal of all Belgian troops from the Republic of the Congo."

The statement also said, "The Afro-Asian group is also deeply convinced of the urgent need to maintain the territorial integrity of this new republic and regrets the actions of certain elements endangering [the Congo's] territorial integrity."

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Leopoldville: Congolese soldiers and civilians are valiantly resisting the Belgian aggressor troops throughout the country to defend their national independence. At the same time, however, some United Nations troops commanded by United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche, an American, and European officers, are stepping up the occupation of Congolese army camps and disarming them.

According to reports, in Bunia, near Uganda in the northeastern part of Congo's Orientale Province, the Congolese army resisted invading Belgian paratroopers on the 19th. In a fierce battle, the Congolese army killed two Belgian colonial soldiers and wounded one. In Lokandu, in the northern part of Congo's Kivu Province, the Congolese people's armed forces also captured two Belgian officers and eleven soldiers in a battle to repel a Belgian paratrooper unit.

Reports indicate that the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against colonialism is continuing to develop in depth in Kasongo in Kivu Province and many places in Orientale Province.

However, according to a United Nations spokesman in Leopoldville on the 20th, after occupying the Congolese army barracks in Leopoldville and Thysville, the United Nations forces, again under the pretext of "maintaining order," entered the port of Matadi on the 20th, which the Congolese army had bravely repelled attacking Belgian forces several times and had been firmly defending. In fact, the order in this important city, which the Belgian army failed to seize, was very good. The United Nations spokesman himself said: The United Nations forces entering the port of Matadi found that the port facilities were almost completely untouched, the cranes were working as usual, the breakwaters were not damaged, and the oil loading and unloading pumps were intact.

Other reports say that the United Nations forces, which had earlier occupied the Hardy camp in Thysville, had disarmed the Congolese army. Two other United Nations forces have been dispatched to Coquilhatville, the capital of Equateur Province, and Watsa in Orientale Province.

There is no news that the United Nations forces have taken similar actions against the Belgian aggressor troops. However, according to reports, around the time the United Nations forces entered the Congo, Belgian colonial troops carried out armed interventions against the Congolese people in twenty-four locations in the Congo. Congolese Minister of Information Kashamura condemned the atrocities of the Belgian colonialists in a radio broadcast on the 19th. He announced that Africans from places such as Kasongo and Kindu had complained that they had been subjected to the most shameful and barbaric acts of abuse by those who call themselves "civilized people" (colonists). He also said that the Belgians said that the Congolese army raped white women, but on the contrary, it was the Belgian colonialists who raped African women.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Leopoldville: Since the entry of United Nations forces into the Congo, the number of Belgian aggressor troops there has not decreased, but has increased further. The United Nations Secretary-General's special representative in the Congo, the American Ralph Bunche, openly announced that the mission of this United Nations force is to "assist in restoring order." While maintaining cooperation with the Belgian aggressor troops, the United Nations forces are constantly taking over areas guarded by the Congolese army.

The United Nations force began to enter the Congo after United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche was appointed interim commander on July 15th. At that time, the Belgian troops sent to the Congo to suppress the people's struggle were announced to be twenty-three companies. By the 20th, the Belgian Ministry of Defense announced that the aggressor troops it had sent to the Congo numbered twenty-nine companies, that is, six companies had been added in less than five days.

A Belgian government spokesman said on the 20th in Brussels, the Belgian capital, that Belgium was ready to continue sending troops to the Congo at any time, as long as it deemed it "necessary." The spokesman also said that Belgium "has the right and the obligation" to ensure that Europeans in the Congo receive "protection."

The report on the United Nations' dispatch of troops to the Congo, submitted by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 18th, did not mention at all how to implement the Security Council's resolution demanding that Belgium withdraw its troops from the Congo. He cited a letter from the Belgian ambassador to Bunche saying: "In the event of serious and urgent situations, Belgian troops will continue to take the necessary security measures."

Many reports indicate that there is close cooperation between the Belgian aggressor troops and the United Nations forces. At a press conference in Leopoldville on the 20th, someone asked Bunche whether Belgium was cooperating with the United Nations. Bunche replied: "Yes."

The following things also reflect the relationship between the United Nations forces and the Belgian army:

Belgium emphasizes that the mission of the United Nations forces is to maintain so-called "order" in the Congo and to "guarantee" the "safety" of Belgians and Europeans. Bunche also said in a statement issued to the Congolese capital press on the 20th that the United Nations forces would "assume the responsibility of maintaining [Congolese] law and order"; "Providing full guarantees to all residents (including European and African residents) is the current deepest concern of United Nations activities here."

Everyone knows that British General Alexander, who participated in the United Nations force, and Swedish General von Horn, the current commander of the United Nations forces, both met with Belgian military officials, the Belgian ambassador, and the American ambassador, among others, upon their arrival in the Congo. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Leopoldville on the 16th, on the day of von Horn's arrival in Leopoldville, the United Nations forces reached an agreement with the Belgian forces, "precisely defining the 'spheres of influence' of the various armed forces." The news said that Belgian officers and United Nations forces officers "held a meeting at the city center operations headquarters for this matter." Then, the United Nations forces began to occupy certain "strongholds" assigned to them.

Belgian colonial troops had frantically clamored for Congolese armed soldiers to lay down their weapons, and British United Nations forces officer Alexander immediately demanded that Congolese soldiers hand over their weapons upon his arrival in the Congo.

Currently, in several famous cities where the Congolese army and civilians bravely resisted the invaders, United Nations forces have been assigned to occupy or "take over" command of the Congolese army. Reports say that Bunche and von Horn have repeatedly held talks with the Congolese government to discuss the "peaceful takeover" of the Congo.

The Leopoldville radio station building and the Congolese army headquarters' Leopold II camp were among the first to be occupied by the United Nations forces after the arrival of Generals Alexander and von Horn. According to news reports on the 19th, the United Nations forces occupying the camp disarmed the Congolese army there. Currently, the Leopoldville airport is also controlled by the United Nations forces.

After this, Belgian forces announced their withdrawal from the Leopoldville area, but reports say that these forces will only move to Belgian military bases in Katanga Province.

At the same time, United Nations forces are actively intervening in places in the interior of the Congo where people are rising up against the colonialists. Reports say that the United Nations Secretary-General has requested that a United Nations force be sent to Watsa in northeastern Congo to help the colonialists who have been provoked and retaliated against by the local people.

A United Nations force dispatched to Thysville, where Congolese soldiers and civilians resolutely resisted the Belgian aggressor troops, occupied the Congolese army's Hardy camp there on the 18th and "took over" command of the Congolese army personnel there, disarming the Congolese army. According to Western news agencies, when the United Nations force went to occupy the camp, it was resisted by Congolese soldiers.

Belgian colonialists have repeatedly demanded that United Nations forces occupy the port of Matadi, the Congo's largest seaport, where the Congolese army and civilians have bravely defeated Belgian aggressor troops many times. An Associated Press dispatch from Leopoldville on the 20th said that a United Nations force had entered the seaport on the 20th.

It has been announced that as of the 20th, more than three thousand United Nations troops have arrived in the Congo. But Bunche said that he had been assured that the number would exceed ten thousand by the end of the week.

The United States has not nominally sent troops to participate in the United Nations force, but a United Press International report on the 19th said that officials estimate that about fifty U.S. Army and Air Force personnel are now serving on the ground in the Congo. This number does not include the crew members of the dozens of Air Force aircraft participating in the transportation effort.

    联合国亚非集团国家发表声明
    要求比利时侵略军立即撤出刚果
    联合国部队不制止比利时侵略反而解除刚果士兵武装
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团二十九个国家20日发表声明，要求比利时侵略军全部立即撤出刚果。
    声明还要求维护刚果的领土完整，反对对刚果领土完整的侵犯。
    这个声明是亚非集团在安全理事会20日晚上再次开会讨论刚果局势以前在一次会议上通过的。声明说，亚非集团20日举行了会议和听取了刚果代表团的声明。“总的一致意见主张所有比利时军队立即撤出刚果共和国。”
    这个声明还说，“亚非集团也深信维护这个新的共和国的领土完整的迫切需要性，并且对某些分子危害（刚果的）领土完整表示遗憾。”
    据新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民为保卫祖国独立，继续在全国英勇抗击比利时侵略军。但是，在这同时，由联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇和欧洲军官指挥的一些联合国军队却加紧占领刚果军队的营地，解除他们的武装。
    据报道，在刚果东方省东北靠近乌干达的布尼亚，刚果军队在19日抗击了入侵的比利时伞兵。在一次激烈的战斗中，刚果军队打死了两名比利时殖民军，打伤了一名。在刚果基伍省北部的洛堪杜，那里的刚果人民武装在反击一支比利时伞兵的战斗中，也曾俘虏了两名比利时军官和十一名士兵。
    有消息说，在基伍省的卡松果和东方省的许多地方，刚果人民反对殖民主义的爱国正义斗争仍在深入发展中。
    但是，据一名联合国发言人20日在利奥波德维尔宣布，联合国军继占领刚果军队在利奥波德维尔和太斯维尔的军营之后，20日又以“维持秩序”为名开进了刚果军队曾经数次奋勇击退来犯比军并且一直坚守着的马塔迪港。其实，这座比利时军队未能侵占的重要城市的秩序很好。就是这位联合国发言人自己也说：进入马塔迪港的联合国军发现港口设备几乎完全没有触动，起重机照常工作，防波堤没有破坏，装卸石油的唧筒也完好无损。
    还有消息说，早些时候占领了太斯维尔哈代营地联合国军已经解除了刚果军队的武装。另有两支联合国军队已被派往赤道省首府科基尔哈特维尔和东方省的瓦查。
    没有任何消息表明联合国军曾对比利时侵略军采取过类似的行动。但是，据报道，就在联合国军进入刚果的前后，比利时殖民军在刚果二十四个地方向刚果人民进行了武装干涉。刚果政府新闻部长卡沙谬拉19日曾在电台广播讲话中谴责比利时殖民主义者的暴行。他宣布，来自卡松果、金德科等地方的非洲人控诉说他们受到自称“文明人”（殖民者）的最可耻的野蛮行为的虐待。他还说，比利时人说刚果军队强奸白人妇女，但是恰恰相反，正是比利时殖民者强奸了非洲妇女。
    据新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：自从联合国部队进入刚果以来，在那里的比利时侵略军不但没有减少，而是更加增加。联合国秘书长在刚果的特派代表、美国人本奇公开宣布，这支联合国部队的任务是“协助恢复秩序”。联合国部队一面正在同比利时侵略军保持合作，一面在不断接管由刚果军队守卫的地区。
    联合国部队是在联合国副秘书长本奇在7月15日被委任临时司令后开始进入刚果的。那时候，比利时派往刚果镇压人民斗争的军队据宣布有二十三个连。到20日，比利时国防部宣布，它派往刚果的侵略军已经有二十九个连，就是说，不到五天增派了六个连。
    比利时政府发言人20日在比利时首都布鲁塞尔说，比利时已经随时准备好军队继续派往刚果，只要它认为“有必要”。这个发言人还说，比利时“有权利也有义务”保证在刚果的欧洲人得到“保护”。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在18日提出的关于联合国出兵刚果的报告，根本也没有谈到如何执行安理会通过的要求比利时把它的军队撤出刚果的决议。他援引比利时大使给本奇的一封信说：“万一发生了严重和紧急的情况，比利时部队将继续采取必要的安全措施”。
    有许多消息表明，在比利时侵略军同联合国军之间，存在着密切的合作关系。20日在利奥波德维尔的一次记者招待会上，有人问本奇，比利时是否同联合国合作。本奇回答说：“是的。”
    下面这些事情也反映了联合国军同比利时军的关系：
    比利时强调联合国部队的任务在于维持刚果的所谓“秩序”，“保证”比利时人和欧洲人的“安全”。本奇在20日向刚果首都报界发表的一项公告也说，联合国部队将“承担维持（刚果）法律和秩序的责任”；“对全体居民（包括欧洲和非洲居民在内）提供充分保障是这里联合国活动的当前最深切关心的事”。
    大家知道，参加联合国部队的英籍将军亚历山大和现任联合国军司令瑞典将军范霍恩在抵达刚果当初都是先同比利时军方、比利时大使和美国大使等人会谈的。据法新社利奥波德维尔16日报道，在范霍恩抵达利奥波德维尔的这一天，联合国部队就同比利时部队达成一项协议，“确切地划分了各个武装部队的‘势力范围’”。这条消息说，比利时军官和联合国部队的军官“为这一件事在市中心作战总部举行了一次会议”。接着，联合国军就开始占领指派给它们的某些“据点”。
    比利时殖民军曾经疯狂地叫嚣要刚果武装士兵放下武器，联合国军英籍军官亚历山大在刚刚抵达刚果的时候竟也立即要求刚果士兵交出武器。
    目前，在刚果军民曾经奋勇抗击侵略者的几个著名城市，联合国军已被纷纷指派前往占领或者“接管”刚果军队的指挥权。有消息说，本奇和范霍恩一再在同刚果政府举行会谈，讨论“和平接管”刚果的问题。
    利奥波德维尔的电台大厦和刚果军队总部的利奥波德二号营地已经在亚历山大和范霍恩将军到达以后最先被联合国军占领。据19日的消息报道，占领这个营地的联合国军解除了那里刚果军队的武装。目前，利奥波德维尔机场也被联合国军所控制。
    在这以后，比利时部队宣布自利奥波德维尔地区撤退，但是消息说，这些部队将只是移动到加丹加省的比利时军事基地去。
    同时，联合国部队正在积极插向刚果内地人民群起反抗殖民者的地方。有消息说，联合国秘书长要求派一支联合国军部队赶往刚果东北部的瓦查，帮助那里由于挑衅而遭到当地人民回击的殖民者。
    被派往刚果军民坚决抗击比利时侵略军的太斯维尔去的一支联合国军，18日占领了那里刚果军队的哈代营地，并且“接管”了那里刚果陆军人员的指挥权，解除了刚果军队的武装。据西方通讯社报道，当这支联合国军队前往占领这个营地时，遭到了刚果士兵的反抗。
    比利时殖民者一再要求联合国部队占领刚果最大的海港马塔迪港，这个海港的刚果军民曾多次英勇地击败了比利时侵略军。美联社20日从利奥波德维尔发出的消息说，一支联合国军队已经在20日进入了这一海港。
    据宣布，到20日为止，已经有三千多名联合国军到了刚果。但是本奇说，他已得到保证，到本周末，这个数字将要超过一万人。
    美国名义上还没有派部队参加联合国军，但是合众国际社19日的一条消息说，据官员们估计，约有五十名美国陆军和空军人员现在在刚果地面上服务。这个数字还不包括参加运输工作的好几十架空军飞机的机上人员。
