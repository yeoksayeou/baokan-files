　　The Surge of Support
　　—Observations and Thoughts
　　Gu Ming
    It is said that Wuhan is the hottest city in China, and we only realized this was true after this trip to Wuhan. In Wuhan, in the evenings and late at night, we would always see rows of bamboo beds lying close together on the sidewalks, filled with sleeping people; people also slept on the platforms of tall buildings. When we arrived in Wuhan, we happened to be there during the mass movement of all trades and professions supporting agriculture. That kind of vigorous, fervent surge of support was even higher than the summer temperature in Wuhan.
    As early as last year, various units in Hubei Province did a lot of work in supporting agriculture's fight against drought. This year, the support for summer harvesting and transplanting was also very outstanding. The province's chemical enterprises produced four times more chemical fertilizer in the first quarter than in the same period last year. The highly effective insecticide known as "One Sweep," only produced 9.5 tons in the first quarter of last year, but produced 124 tons in the first quarter of this year. The Xiangyang Special District Agricultural Machinery School trained technicians for the communes. When the Wuhan Fourth Hospital supported the countryside, it used the method of large hospitals leading small hospitals, and dispatched two teams to work in Huangpi and Anlu counties. In order to put support for agriculture in the first place, the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a "Ten Thousand People Swearing-in Rally" for the entire city to support agriculture. After hearing the news that this year's wheat area was large and growing well, and that more straw twine was needed for bundling wheat, residents of Songbu extracted more than 12,000 catties of rice straw used for bedding from their homes to rush to make straw twine. Commercial business personnel in Wuhan went to the countryside to work, publicize, and supply goods, ensuring that food was delivered to their mouths and supplies were delivered to their hands. The workers repeatedly told the commune: "The commune's difficulties are the factory's difficulties. Just tell us what to do!" Many factories are working hard to create more, better, and more suitable agricultural machinery needed by the "Eight-Character Charter" to meet the various needs of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and to accelerate agricultural technical transformation.
    In the upsurge of support for agriculture, everyone fully displayed the style of "others before self" and "helping whenever there is a need," and the technical support provided was also top-notch. After an engineer from the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau who was supporting agriculture arrived at the Liuge Commune, he managed to repair two water pumps and another machine that had not been repaired for a long time, after racking his brains to match 291 parts, making all these machines work normally. Seventy-two technicians from various units in Wuhan supported Xianning County, repairing and fitting power machinery for Xianning County, greatly improving the industrial level of the county and communes.
    All trades and industries are busy supporting agriculture; support for agriculture is being discussed everywhere. When I visited the Hubei Tractor Factory and the Wuhan Machine Tool Factory, I saw piles of various types of machinery already packed in boxes, with labels indicating they were to be received by a certain county or commune, both inside and outside the factories, and some were being loaded onto trucks for shipment. In the workshops, the workers were also actively rushing to produce drainage and irrigation machinery and other equipment urgently needed in the countryside, despite the high temperatures. Many factories in Wuhan have established regular relationships with certain areas, implementing factory-commune pairing, counterpart contracting, and everyone taking action. It is clearly stipulated which factories are responsible for which county, and which county is supported by which factories. The targets are clear, and responsibilities cannot be shirked.
    Everyone knows that the high-speed development of agriculture can produce more grain, industrial raw materials, and non-staple foods to meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy; this will also promote the development of light industry, increase the purchasing power of rural areas for means of production, and expand the market for heavy industry. "Two melons on one vine, workers and peasants are one family." The relationship between industry and agriculture is one of mutual support and mutual promotion. It is precisely because of this that, under the call of the Party, a massive mass movement of cities supporting the countryside has been launched throughout the country. It has truly achieved everyone taking action, doing their best, and regarding supporting the countryside and gradually realizing agricultural technical transformation as their unshirkable responsibility.
    It has been several days since I left Wuhan, but the enthusiastic wave of support for agriculture still remains in my mind. This enthusiasm, compared to the impression given to me by the hot weather in Wuhan, is more profound and more unforgettable. The heat of Wuhan's climate has long disappeared from our bodies, but the enthusiasm of Wuhan, no, the entire Hubei people, for supporting agriculture will never disappear for me.

　　支援热
　　——见闻杂感

    据说武汉是我国最炎热的城市，我们这次到武汉，才了解到这话一点不假。在武汉的傍晚和深夜，我们总会看到马路的人行道上放着一张张紧挨着睡满了人的竹床，在高楼的平台上也睡了人。我们来到武汉的时候，正赶上开展各行各业支援农业的群众运动。那种轰轰烈烈、热火朝天的支援热，实在比武汉夏天的气温还要高得多。
    早在去年，湖北省各单位在支援农业抗旱方面，就做了许多工作。今年支援夏收插栽也做得很出色。全省化工企业在第一季度生产的化学肥料，比去年同期增长了四倍。被人称为“一扫光”的高效杀虫农药，去年一季度只生产九吨半，今年一季度就生产了一百二十四吨。襄阳专区农业机械学校为公社培训技术人员。武汉市第四医院在支援农村时用大医院带小医院的办法，抽出了两套班子，到黄陂、安陆县工作。为了把支援农业放在第一位，中共沙市市委曾召开了全市支援农业的“万人誓师大会”。宋埠居民听到今年小麦面积大、长得好，需要更多的捆麦用的草?子的消息以后，就把自己家中垫床的稻草抽出一万二千多斤来赶制草?子。武汉市商业营业人员到农村边劳动、边宣传、边供应，做到吃的送到口，用的送到手。工人们一再向公社表示：“公社的困难就是厂的困难，有事只管叫我们干！”很多工厂都努力创造更多更好更适合“八字宪法”所需要的农业机具，满足农林牧副渔的各项需要，加速农业技术改造。
    在支援农业的热潮中，大家充分发挥了“先人后己”、“见需要就帮”的风格，支援的技术力量也都是头等的。长江航运局支援农业的一位工程师到刘格公社后，把长期没有修好的两台抽水机和另外一台机器，经过千方百计，配了二百九十一件零件，使这些机器全部正常使用。武汉市各单位支援咸宁县技工七十二人，替咸宁县修配了动力机械，大大提高了县社工业水平。
    各行各业忙的都是支援农业；大街小巷，议论的都是支援农业。我在参观湖北拖拉机厂、武汉机床厂时，看到他们厂里厂外堆满了已经装箱、上面写着某县某公社收的大批各式各样的机械，有的正在装车待发。在车间里，工人们也正在不顾高温，积极赶制排灌机械等农村中急需的设备。武汉市的很多工厂都和一定的地区建立经常的关系，实行厂社挂钩、对口包干、人人动手。哪几家厂包哪一个县：哪一个县由哪几家厂包，规定得清清楚楚。真是对象明确，责无旁贷。
    大家都知道农业高速度发展，就能够生产出更多的粮食、工业原料和副食品，来满足国民经济各方面的需要；这样也就促进轻工业的发展，提高农村对生产资料的购买力，扩大重工业的市场。“一根藤上两个瓜，工人农民是一家”。工农业的关系就是相互支援、相互促进的。正是因为这样，所以在党的一声号召之下，顿时全国就掀起了一个声势浩大的城市支援农村的群众运动。真是做到了各行各业、男女老幼、人人动手，各尽所能，把支援农村逐步实现农业技术改造，看成是自己义不容辞的任务。
    离开武汉已经好几天了，可是那种轰轰烈烈支援农业的热浪，仍然在我的心头保持着。这股热劲，比起武汉炎热的天气给我的印象，是来得更深刻，更难以忘怀。武汉气候的热，在我们身上早已消失了，然而武汉，不，整个湖北人民的支援热，对我来说是永远也不会消失的。
