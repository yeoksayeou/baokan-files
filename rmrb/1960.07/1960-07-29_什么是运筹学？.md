What is Operations Research?

Operations Research is an emerging mathematical discipline. It includes many branches such as planning theory, queuing theory, and game theory. Planning theory is further divided into linear programming, non-linear programming, dynamic programming, etc. "Yun Chou" (运筹) means calculation and planning. In ancient China, there was a saying: "Planning strategies within the command tent, deciding victory thousands of miles away." During the Warring States period, the King of Qi and his minister, Tian Ji, competed in horse racing and archery in Linzi. The competition was divided into three rounds, with each round worth a thousand gold. Tian Ji lost money repeatedly because his horses were not as strong. Sun Bin, a retainer of Tian Ji, offered Tian Ji a plan: use the inferior horse against the Qi king's superior horse, use the superior horse against the Qi king's middle horse, and use the middle horse against the Qi king's inferior horse. As a result, Tian Ji won two rounds and lost one, gaining a thousand gold. This is an example of a game theory problem.

Currently, the most widely used application in China is linear programming. Linear programming is a discipline that uses mathematical and economic methods to study how to complete tasks to the greatest extent with the least amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It can be applied to everything from the national economy to family life. Its main methods include the graphical method, the tabular method, and the simplex method. The graphical method and the tabular method are simple, clear, quick to calculate, and easy to promote methods used in transportation and material allocation. When formulating a plan, drawing it on a graph or table, and then calculating it using mathematical methods, the best plan can be selected from it. These two operational methods were created by material allocation workers in our country in their actual work. After research by scientific research departments, it has been proven that they are completely in line with the principles of linear programming. Using the graphical method and the tabular method to dispatch vehicles and allocate materials can greatly reduce unreasonable phenomena such as empty vehicle trips, counter-current flow of the same type of materials, and circuitous transportation. The simplex method is also widely used in many aspects of industry and agriculture, such as rational factory and warehouse layout, rational material cutting in factories, rational equipment utilization, rational planning of farmland water conservancy, and rational allocation of labor.

    什么是运筹学？
    运筹学，是一门新兴数学学科。它包括规划论、排队论、博奕论等很多分支。规划论，又分线性规划、非线性规划、动态规划等。运筹，是运算、筹划的意思。我国古代就有“运筹帷幄之中，决胜于千里之外”的说法。战国时候，齐国的国王和大夫田忌于临淄竞马驰射。竞赛分三场进行，每场以千金为采。田忌因马力不及，屡败失金。时有田忌的门客孙膑向田忌献策：以下马对齐王的上马，以上马对齐王的中马，以中马对齐王的下马。结果，田忌两胜一负，多得千金。这就是一个属于博奕的问题。
    当前，在我国应用最广的是线性规划。线性规划，是用数学和经济学的方法，研究如何用最少的人力、物力和财力去最大限度的完成任务的一门学问。大至国民经济，小至家庭生活，都有用它的地方。它的主要方法，有图上作业法、表上作业法和单纯形法等。图上作业法和表上作业法，是交通运输、物资调拨中的一个简单明了、计算迅速、易于推行的方法。制订一个方案时，往图上或表上一画，再用数学方法一算，就可以从中选出最好的方案。这两个作业法，是我国作物资调运工作人员在实际工作中创造出来的，经科学研究部门研究，证明完全合乎线性规划原理。用图上作业法和表上作业法调度车辆、调拨物资，可以大大减少车辆空驶和同种物资对流和迂回运输等不合理现象。单纯形法，用途也很广泛，工农业中的许多方面都用得着它，如工厂、仓库合理布局、工厂合理下料、设备合理利用、农田水利合理规划、劳力合理调配等等。
