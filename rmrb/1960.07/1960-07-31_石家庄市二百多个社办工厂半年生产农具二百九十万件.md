    Shijiazhuang City's Over 200 Commune-Run Factories Produce 2.9 Million Pieces of Farm Equipment in Six Months
    (Our report) Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, urban people's commune industry vigorously supports agriculture, universally links up with rural production teams, and focuses on the manufacture and repair of agricultural machinery, as well as the production of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides.
    The Qiaodong, Qiaoxi, and Chang'an three urban people's communes in Shijiazhuang City have a total of 270 larger factories. These factories have established links with the 327 production teams under the three communes, and formulated plans to complete tasks in stages and batches according to the needs of each production team for agricultural machinery and water conservancy irrigation and drainage machinery. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of the year, a total of 659 units of various water conservancy irrigation and drainage machinery such as gas engines and low-pressure steam water carts were produced, 2.9 million pieces of various small farm tools such as shovels, picks, and hoes, more than 8,000 tons of agricultural fertilizer (including native fertilizer), 8,769 tons of pesticides, and more than 740,000 pieces of various repaired machinery, small farm tools, and machine parts; at the same time, support was also provided to the production teams in terms of labor, machinery repair, technology, and necessary equipment. According to preliminary statistics, during the busy agricultural seasons in the first half of the year, the linked industrial units dispatched more than 50,000 person-times to provide labor support to the production teams, and through vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, extracted more than 250 units of locomobiles, diesel engines, gas engines, water pumps, electric motors, and lathes from within, and exchanged them to the production teams for use according to the principle of "equal value exchange," and also helped the production teams set up some machine repair factories (stations), and trained more than 980 various technical personnel for the communes and production teams.
    The vigorous support of commune industry has promoted the development of agricultural production, enabling the production teams to not only make rapid progress in agricultural work this year, but also improve the quality. The 71 production teams of the Chang'an People's Commune overcame the severe drought this year, and generally increased production. The total output of summer wheat increased by 66% compared with last year, and basically realized the electrification of water conservancy irrigation through large-scale water conservancy construction to combat drought.
    After the factories linked up with the production teams, the profound friendship between workers and peasants, as close as brothers and sisters, was enhanced. Industrial leaders and workers vigorously engaged in "experimental fields" and contracted high-yield plots. Through practice, they realized the significance of vigorously supporting agriculture and further understood the demands of agriculture on handicrafts. They were able to effectively grasp the actual needs of agriculture in comprehensively supporting agriculture and guiding production. Factory workers from the Chang'an and Qiaoxi People's Communes trial-produced nearly 200 machines such as feed crushers, small steel mills, and sweet potato slicers for agricultural production teams. The support of industry has greatly encouraged the vast number of rural commune members. Many production team members proposed: The worker elders have given us selfless support and guided us to build socialism. We must work hard! Rural commune members first guarantee the supply of vegetables and other various non-staple foods to the factories. Some production teams in the Qiaoxi Commune actively dispatched vehicles to assist the Hui Muslim Cardboard Box Factory in a concentrated effort to carry out short-distance transportation when agricultural work was not busy; some production teams in the Chang'an People's Commune actively transported industrial raw materials needed by the factories to the factories.

    石家庄市二百多个社办工厂半年生产农具二百九十万件
    本报讯　河北省石家庄市城市人民公社工业大力支援农业，普遍与农村生产队挂钩，大抓农业机器制造、修配以及农肥、农药的生产。
    石家庄市桥东、桥西、长安三个城市人民公社，共有二百七十个较大的工厂，这些厂与三个公社所属的三百二十七个生产队，相互建立了挂钩关系，根据各生产队所需要的农械和水利排灌机械的要求，制定了分期分批完成任务的规划。据上半年不完全统计，共生产了煤气机、低压蒸汽水车等各种水利排灌机械六百五十九部，锨、镐、锄头等各种小农具二百九十万件，农肥（包括土化肥）八千多吨，农药八千七百六十九吨，修理的各种机械、小农具及机器零件约达七十四万多件；和这同时，还从劳力、机械修理、技术以及必要的设备等方面，对生产队进行支援。据初步统计，在上半年各农忙季节，挂钩的工业单位先后出动了五万多人次给生产队劳力支援，并通过大搞技术革新、技术革命，从内部抽出了锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机、水泵、电动机、车床二百五十多台，按照“等价交换”的原则换给生产队使用，还帮助生产队办起一些机器修理厂（站），为公社与生产队培训了各种技术人材九百八十多名。
    公社工业的大力支援，促进了农业生产的发展，使各生产队今年的农活，不光进展快，而且质量也有提高。长安人民公社七十一个生产队今年战胜了严重的干旱，普遍增了产，夏季小麦的总产量比去年增长了66％，并通过大兴水利抗旱基本上实现了水利灌溉的电气化。
    工厂与生产队挂钩以后，增强了工农亲如手足的深厚情谊。工业领导干部和职工大搞“试验田”，包丰产方，通过实践认识到大力支援农业的意义，进一步了解农业对手工业的要求，在全面支援农业和指导生产上能够切实掌握从农业的实际需要出发。长安和桥西两个人民公社的工厂职工为农业生产队试制出了饲料粉碎机、小钢磨、薯类切片机等机械近二百台。工业的支援，使广大农村社员受到了极大的鼓舞。许多生产队社员提出：工人老大哥给了咱们无私的支援，引导咱们建设社会主义，一定要好好干！农村社员首先保证工厂菜蔬和其他各种副食品的供应。桥西公社有的生产队的社员，在农活不忙时，还主动抽出车辆协助回民纸盒厂突击搞短途运输；长安人民公社的一些生产队，主动把工厂所需要的工业原料，运往工厂。
