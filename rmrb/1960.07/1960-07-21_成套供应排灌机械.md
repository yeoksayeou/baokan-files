    Complete Sets of Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Supplied

    Shanghai commercial departments are actively strengthening the allocation and supply of various agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment. This year, six-fifths of the irrigation and drainage equipment planned to be manufactured in Shanghai is for supply to other areas, with more than 400 varieties of parts and more than 1,200 specifications. In the first half of the year, the complete sets of irrigation and drainage equipment, such as machines, pumps, pipes, and belts, allocated and supplied to various places by the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Procurement and Supply Station, have exceeded 10% of the contract plan for the first half of the year.

    Shanghai commercial departments have paid special attention to the matching of various equipment and the supply of accessories this year. Although there are very few all-around factories manufacturing agricultural machinery in Shanghai, thanks to the active organization of close cooperation between various factories by the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Procurement and Supply Station, the more than 2,000 pumps, machines, pipes, and belts supplied to various places this year are complete and in complete sets.

    成套供应排灌机械
    上海商业部门正在积极加强各项农业排灌设备的调拨供应工作。上海今年计划制造的排灌设备，有六分之五是供应外地的，部件品种达四百多种，规格有一千二百多种。上半年，经由上海农业机械采购供应站调拨供应各地的机、泵、管、带等成套排灌设备已超过了上半年合同计划的10％。
    上海商业部门今年特别注意各项设备的配套和配件供应工作。上海虽然很少有制造农业机械的全能工厂，但是由于上海农业机械采购供应站积极组织各厂之间密切协作，今年供应各地的两千多台水泵、机、管、带都很齐全，台台成套。
