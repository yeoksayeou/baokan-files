Xinhua News Agency, July 19th. The Government of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement in support of the Congolese people's opposition to imperialist aggression and interference. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　After a long struggle, the Congolese people achieved independence from the enslavement of Belgian colonialism on June 30th of this year. The Belgian government, unwilling to accept defeat, actually sent armed forces into the Republic of the Congo just eight days later, on July 8th, under the pretext of "protecting" Belgian nationals and "the interests of the Free World." They carried out brutal armed suppression of the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and to oppose the Belgian government's subversion and division schemes. It attempts to use armed force to cancel the independence already gained by the Congolese people and restore colonial rule in the Congo. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people stand firmly with the people of the Republic of the Congo, solemnly condemn and protest the Belgian government's act of armed aggression, and resolutely support the heroic Congolese people's just struggle against colonialism and for the defense of national independence.

　　The above-mentioned act of armed aggression by the Belgian colonialists is supported by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. Just as the Belgian colonialists' armed suppression and conspiracy to divide the Congo were being struck by the Congolese people, U.S. imperialism tried every possible means to invade the Republic of the Congo. On July 11, the third day of the Belgian colonialists' armed suppression of the Congolese people, White, the press officer of the U.S. State Department, wantonly slandered that "law and order have been disrupted" in various parts of the Congo, and declared that "it is necessary to protect the lives of nationals by any appropriate means." Then, on July 12, the U.S. Navy Department announced, the "Wasp" aircraft carrier had been ordered to sail from the Mediterranean to the South Atlantic to exert military threat to the Republic of the Congo, and attempted to use the pretext of "protecting" American nationals and "restoring order" to carry out armed intervention in the Republic of the Congo. The Chinese government and people strongly condemn this criminal act of intervention by U.S. imperialism.

　　The Congolese people have waged a long-term struggle for national independence. This is the sacred right of the Congolese people. After gaining independence, it is equally their sacred right to use their own strength to safeguard and consolidate national independence. The Belgian colonialists, with the support of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, are carrying out armed intervention in the Republic of the Congo, which is not only a gross violation of the national sovereignty of the Congo and a shameless attack on the vigorously developing African national independence movement, but also a serious provocation to peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. What should especially arouse the vigilance of the Congolese people and all African people is that the U.S. imperialists are impatiently putting on hypocritical faces or undisguisedly invading the Congo and Africa, attempting to take the place of the old colonialists and replace them, so that they can escape from the hands of one colonialist and immediately fall under the rule of another colonialist. Now, the people of the Republic of the Congo are uniting and heroically resisting the Belgian aggressor troops and opposing the interference and military threats of imperialist countries headed by the United States. This just struggle of the Congolese people has won the sympathy and support of the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese government and people deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people, and believe that the Belgian aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from the Congo completely, and the imperialist countries headed by the United States must immediately stop interfering in the Congo.

　　The Chinese government and people will always stand on the side of the Congolese people and the African people, resolutely support their struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the defense and winning of national independence, and firmly believe that as long as the Congolese people and the African people unite strongly and closely with the people of Asia, Latin America, and the world, all acts of aggression and interference by imperialism and colonialism will surely be completely defeated.

　　我国政府发表声明
　　支持刚果人民反对侵略和干涉
　　严正谴责比利时政府武装侵略和美帝国主义干涉行为
　　比利时侵略军必须立即撤出刚果，以美国为首的帝国主义必须立即停止干涉
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国政府今天发表关于支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉的声明。声明全文如下：
    刚果人民经过长期斗争，于今年6月30日从比利时殖民主义的奴役下实现独立。比利时政府不甘失败，竟在八天之后，即7月8日，以“保护”比利时侨民和
  “自由世界利益”为借口，派遣武装部队侵入刚果共和国，对刚果人民维护民族独立和主权、反对比利时政府的颠覆和分裂阴谋的爱国正义斗争，进行横暴的武装镇压。它企图以武装力量取消刚果人民所已经获得的独立，重新恢复在刚果的殖民统治。中华人民共和国政府和中国人民坚决地同刚果共和国人民站在一起，严正地谴责和抗议比利时政府的武装侵略行为，并且坚决支持英勇的刚果人民反对殖民主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争。
    比利时殖民主义者的上述武装侵略行为，是得到以美国为首的帝国主义集团的支持的。正当比利时殖民主义者的武装镇压和分裂刚果的阴谋遭到刚果人民的打击的时候，美帝国主义就千方百计地设法侵入刚果共和国。在比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民武装镇压的第三天，即7月11日，美国国务院新闻官怀特就大肆诬蔑刚果各地的“法律和秩序遭到破坏”，并且声言“有必要以任何适当手段保护侨民的生命”。接着，7月12日，美国海军部宣布，“黄蜂号”航空母舰已奉命从地中海驶往南大西洋，对刚果共和国施加武力威胁，并且企图借口“保护”美侨和“恢复秩序”，对刚果共和国进行武装干涉。中国政府和人民强烈谴责美帝国主义这种罪恶的干涉行为。
    刚果人民为了争取民族独立，进行长期的斗争，这是刚果人民的神圣权利，他们在获得独立之后，用自己的力量来维护和巩固民族独立，同样是他们的神圣权利。比利时殖民主义者在以美国为首的帝国主义集团的支持之下，对刚果共和国进行武装干涉，不仅是对刚果国家主权的粗暴侵犯，对蓬勃发展的非洲民族独立运动的无耻进攻，而且是对亚非和世界和平的严重挑衅。尤其应该引起刚果人民和全非洲人民警惕的，是美帝国主义者正迫不及待地装起伪善的面孔或者不加掩饰地侵入刚果和非洲，妄图取旧殖民主义者的地位而代之，使它们从一个殖民主义者的手中解脱出来，马上又落入另一个殖民主义者的统治之下。现在，刚果共和国人民正在团结起来，英勇地抗击比利时侵略军和反对以美国为首的帝国主义国家的干涉和武力威胁。刚果人民的这一正义斗争得到了亚非人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的同情和支持。中国政府和人民深切同情和坚决支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争，并且认为，比利时侵略军必须立即全部撤出刚果，以美国为首的帝国主义国家必须立即停止干涉刚果。
    中国政府和人民将永远站在刚果人民和非洲人民一边，坚决支持他们反对帝国主义和殖民主义，维护和争取民族独立的斗争，并且深信，只要刚果人民和非洲人民同亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界的人民坚强地紧密地团结起来，帝国主义和殖民主义的一切侵略和干涉行为，都一定要遭到彻底失败。
