    Soviet Highway Construction Forges Ahead

    New highway trunk lines are extending daily across Soviet lands. One such line, approximately 800 kilometers long, will connect the central Soviet states with the major industrial region of the Urals. Another will stretch from Moscow to the Baltic coast. This year, the Kiev-Odessa highway trunk line in Ukraine will be completed.

    New highways are being extensively built and existing ones renovated in the newly cultivated areas, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Siberia, and the industrial centers of the Far East.

    During the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will build a total of approximately 70,000 kilometers of highways, more than twice as much as in the previous seven years. Last year, the Soviet Union built 6,500 kilometers of highways.

    The Soviet Union Vigorously Opens Helicopter Routes

    In the recent months, the Soviet Union will open approximately one hundred helicopter passenger routes, and by the end of this year, this number will gradually increase to two hundred. Serving these routes will be the comfortable "Mi-4" passenger helicopters capable of carrying ten to eleven passengers.

    Each Soviet republic is organizing helicopter transportation.

    In the Far East and Kamchatka, more than twenty routes, totaling 3,000 kilometers in length, will be opened. Helicopters will fly from cities such as Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur to the vast forest regions.

    Poland's Broad Rural Areas Busy with Summer Harvest

    Poland's broad rural areas have begun their summer harvest. The fields of Opole, Wrocław, Zielona Góra, and Poznań provinces are scenes of busy agricultural activity. Due to abnormal weather this year, the summer harvest has started later than in previous years.

    Poland's summer harvest area is approximately nine million hectares, including five million hectares of winter rye. Despite the drought last winter and this spring, preliminary harvest results indicate that wheat yields in many areas will not be lower than last year, and spring crops and root crops will have good harvests. Before the start of the summer harvest, farmers in various regions made thorough preparations for agricultural implements. The agricultural machinery used by farmers this year has greatly increased compared to last year.

    The summer harvest situation once again demonstrates the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The average yield per hectare of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions is higher than the local average yield.

    Romania's Edible Oil Production Rapidly Develops

    Romania's edible oil production has developed greatly recently. Recently, Constanța, Craiova, and Ploiești provinces began sowing sunflowers, which is Romania's most common oil crop.

    Last year, sunflower production exceeded Romania's highest average yield in ten years, an increase of 7.7 times compared to the pre-war annual average per capita. Last year, edible oil production reached approximately 77,000 tons, an increase of 20 percent compared to 1958. In this way, Romania for the first time relied on domestic production to guarantee the needs of domestic edible oil consumption. This year, edible oil production will reach 115,000 tons. In the coming years, edible oil production and processing capacity will continue to increase. According to regulations, the edible oil processing capacity in 1964 is a processing capacity of 65 tons per year.

专栏：兄弟国家在前进

    苏联公路建设快步向前
    新的公路干线在苏联的土地上日益伸延。其中一条全长约八百公里的干线将把苏联中部各州和乌拉尔的大工业区联结起来。另一条则将从莫斯科伸向波罗的海海岸。今年乌克兰的基辅敖得萨公路干线将要建成。
    现在各垦荒区、乌兹别克斯坦、高加索、西伯利亚和远东各工业中心正在广泛修筑新的公路和改建现有的公路。
    在七年计划期间，苏联总共将修建大约七万公里公路，这比过去七年多两倍多。去年苏联修建了六千五百多公里公路。
    苏联大力开辟直升飞机航线
    最近几个月内，苏联将开辟大约一百多条直升飞机客运航线，到今年底，这种航线将逐渐增加到两百条。在这些航线上服务的将是能载客十人到十一人的舒适的“米—四”型旅客直升飞机。
    苏联每个共和国都在组织直升飞机交通。
    在远东和堪察加将开辟全长达三千公里的二十多条航线。直升飞机将从哈巴罗夫斯克、阿穆尔共青城等城市飞往大森林地区。
    波兰广大农村夏收忙
    波兰广大农村开始了夏收。奥波莱、伏罗茨瓦夫、绿山、波兹南等省的田野里一片农忙景象。由于今年气候不正常，夏收开始得比往年晚。
    波兰今年夏收面积约有九百万公顷，其中冬裸麦五百万公顷。尽管去冬今春天旱，但收割的初步情况表明，许多地区的小麦收成将不低于去年，春种作物和根茎作物将获得丰收。在夏收开始前，各地农民都进行了充分的农具准备。今年农民使用的农业机器比去年有很大增加。
    夏收情况再次显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。各地农业生产合作社每公顷的平均产量均高过当地平均的产量。
    罗马尼亚食油生产迅速发展
    罗马尼亚的食油生产近来有很大的发展。最近，康斯坦萨、克拉约瓦和普罗也什蒂州开始播种向日葵，这是罗马尼亚最普遍的油料作物。
    去年，向日葵的产量超过了罗马尼亚十年来最高平均产量，即按人口平均计算比战前每年平均数量增加七点七倍。去年，食油的产量大约达到七万七千吨，比一九五八年增加百分之二十。这样，罗马尼亚第一次依靠国内生产保证了国内食油消费的需要。今年，食油的产量将达到十一万五千吨。在以后几年里，食油生产及加工能力还要增加。按照规定，一九六四年的食油加工能力是一年加工六十五吨。（附图片）
