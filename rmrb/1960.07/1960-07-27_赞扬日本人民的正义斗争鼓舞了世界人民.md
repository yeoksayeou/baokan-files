Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Deputy Premier Chen Yi today received the delegation from the Japanese "China Research Institute" headed by Yositaro Hirano, the delegation from the Japan National Metal Mine Workers' Union headed by Seiji Sawada, the delegation from the Japan National Relief Association headed by Mitsuo Okamoto, and the delegation from the Japanese Fishery Workers headed by Chizuru Kasahara, who are visiting China.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi expressed a warm welcome to the Japanese friends. He said that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States is a major event that has shaken the world and given tremendous encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people. China and Japan are only separated by a strip of water, and the people of the two countries should be friendly from generation to generation. Sino-Japanese friendship is one of the important factors for world peace.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. It has bullied the people of our two countries for a long time. It has established military bases on Okinawa Island in Japan, and it occupies our country's territory of Taiwan. Opposing U.S. imperialism is the common interest and common struggle task of the people of our two countries. U.S. imperialism is very isolated in the world. It has established more than 200 military bases overseas, causing unrest throughout the world. U.S. imperialism has lost popular support all over the world, and people all over the world oppose it. It is sitting on a volcano.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi said that China loves peace, and we advocate peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems in the world. However, we must resolutely oppose the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism must withdraw from its more than 200 military bases overseas. We must never appease U.S. imperialism. The more we appease it, the greater its ambitions for aggression and its appetite will be. Only by carrying out resolute struggles and giving it a little color can we force it to be a little more sober and dare not undermine peaceful coexistence. The struggles of the people of Japan, Turkey, South Korea, and Cuba all show that U.S. imperialism can be opposed.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi sternly condemned the shameless fabrication by imperialists who slanderously claimed that the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and U.S. military bases was "directed" by China. He said that the great Japanese people will not be "directed" by anyone, and they will take action themselves. The Chinese people are busy with their own affairs. We do not accept instructions from others, nor do we instruct others. In fact, it is precisely the U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries who forcibly and illegally passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and the establishment of U.S. military bases in Japan that aroused the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people. The Japanese people could no longer bear it and were forced to rise up and fight. In fact, the problem is very simple. As long as the U.S. military base on Okinawa is withdrawn and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is abolished, half of the problem will be solved. Therefore, it should be said that it is U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries who "directed" the Japanese people to be forced to rise up and fight.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi said that we hope that the people of China and Japan will be friendly, and we support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and U.S. military bases. The people of China and Japan should support each other, exchange experiences, and learn from each other.

Deputy Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people distinguish between U.S. imperialism and the American people. The Chinese people are willing to be friendly with the peace-loving American people. We are also willing for the Japanese people to be friendly with the American people.

During the reception, Yositaro Hirano, head of the Japanese "China Research Institute" delegation, Seiji Sawada, head of the Japan National Metal Mine Workers' Union delegation, Mitsuo Okamoto, head of the Japan National Relief Association delegation, and Chizuru Kasahara, head of the Japanese Fishery Workers' delegation, all spoke. They warmly thanked the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's just struggle. They said that the victory of the Japanese people's struggle is great, but this is only a preliminary victory. The Japanese people are determined to make persistent efforts to launch struggles, continue to resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, resolutely oppose U.S. military bases, and demand the establishment of friendly relations with China. They also wished the people of Japan and China to unite and fight against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

Present at the reception were Liao Chengzhi, Li Dequan, Li Jiebo, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, and others, as well as Japanese peace personage Kinkazu Saionji.

    陈毅副总理接见在我国访问的日本朋友
    赞扬日本人民的正义斗争鼓舞了世界人民
    重申中国坚决支持日本人民的斗争，中日人民应该世世代代友好
    严斥帝国主义者诬蔑日本人民的反美爱国斗争是中国“指使”的无耻捏造
    新华社26日讯　陈毅副总理今天接见了以平野义太郎为首的日本“中国研究所”访华代表团、以泽田政治为首的日本全国金属矿山工会访华代表团、以冈本光雄为首的日本国民救援会访华代表团和以笠原千鹤为首的日本渔业工人访华代表团。
    陈毅副总理对日本朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，日本人民反美爱国正义斗争是震动世界的大事件，给了全世界爱好和平人民巨大的鼓舞，中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。中国和日本只有一海之隔，两国人民应该世世代代友好，中日友好是世界和平的重要因素之一。
    陈毅副总理说，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，它长期地欺负我们两国人民，它在日本的冲绳岛建立军事基地，它霸占着我国的领土台湾，反对美帝国主义是我们两国人民的共同利益和共同的斗争任务。美帝国主义在全世界很孤立，它在海外建立了二百多个军事基地，闹得全世界不得安宁。美帝国主义在全世界丧失人心，全世界人民都反对它，它正坐在火山口上。
    陈毅副总理说，中国是爱好和平的，我们主张世界上不同社会制度的国家和平共处。但是对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策必须坚决反对，美帝国主义必须从它海外的二百多个军事基地撤退。对美帝国主义绝不能一味迁就，越迁就它的侵略野心和胃口就越大，只有进行坚决斗争，给他点颜色看看，才能迫使它清醒一点，不敢破坏和平共处。日本人民、土耳其人民、南朝鲜人民和古巴人民的斗争，都说明美帝国主义是可以反对的。
    陈毅副总理严厉斥责了帝国主义者诬蔑日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和美国军事基地的正义斗争是中国“指使”的无耻捏造。他说，伟大的日本人民是不会受任何人的“指使”的，他们自己会行动起来的。中国人民在忙着办自己的事情，我们不接受别人的指使，也从不指使别人。实际上，正是美帝国主义和日本反动派强制非法通过日美军事同盟条约和美帝国主义在日本建立军事基地，引起了日本人民的不满，日本人民忍无可忍被迫起来进行斗争。其实问题很简单，只要冲绳美国军事基地一撤退，日美军事同盟条约一废除，问题就解决了一半。所以，应该这么说才对，是美帝国主义和日本反动派“指使”日本人民被迫起来进行斗争的。
    陈毅副总理说，我们希望中日两国人民友好，我们支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和美国军事基地的斗争，中日两国人民应该互相支持，互相交流经验，互相学习。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民是把美帝国主义和美国人民区别开来的，中国人民愿意同爱好和平的美国人民友好。我们也愿意日本人民同美国人民友好。
    在接见的时候，日本“中国研究所”访华代表团团长平野义太郎、日本全国金属矿山工会访华代表团团长泽田政治、日本国民救援会访华代表团团长冈本光雄和日本渔业工人访华代表团团长笠原千鹤都谈了话。他们热烈感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的支持。他们说，日本人民斗争的胜利是巨大的，但这仅仅是初步的胜利，日本人民决心再接再厉展开斗争，继续坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决反对美国军事基地，并且要求同中国建立友好关系。他们还祝愿日中两国人民团结起来，为反对共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    接见时在座的，有廖承志、李德全、李颉伯、楚图南、丁西林等人，以及日本和平人士西园寺公一。
