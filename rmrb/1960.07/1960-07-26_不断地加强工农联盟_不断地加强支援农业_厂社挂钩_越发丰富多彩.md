Liaoning: Taking linked factories as the main force, absorbing various units to form a support committee, and better promote agricultural technical transformation.
Anhui: Adopt methods such as matching large and small factories, uniting small factories, and matching specialties to uniformly adjust factory-commune links.
Harbin: Comprehensively and systematically supports agriculture by using urban communes to lead counties, factories to lead communes, factory-commune hook-ups, and all-inclusive responsibility.

Shenyang, July 25th (By our reporter) The good form of "factory-commune hook-up" implemented in Liaoning Province, an important industrial base in China, to support agricultural technical transformation, has now undergone new developments, and a new upsurge of comprehensive support for agriculture by all walks of life with industry as the mainstay is unfolding in depth. At present, 2,132 factories, mines, transportation, postal and telecommunications, commerce, finance, science and technology, culture, education, and health units in the province have actively participated in supporting agricultural activities. Various places have formed cooperation committees to support agriculture, jointly linked with counties and communes, unified planning, comprehensive arrangements, fixed support, and all-inclusive responsibility.

According to different situations, factory-commune hook-ups in Liaoning have currently developed into four forms. (1) One factory is responsible for one commune. The advantage of this form is that the object is fixed, the responsibility is clear, and the tasks are specific. (2) Several factories are responsible for one commune or several factories are responsible for several communes. That is, several factories and mines are organized into a large group, linked to one or several communes, with a backbone factory as the group leader. This form not only facilitates the division of labor and cooperation between factories and mines, learning from each other's strengths, making up for each other's weaknesses, and promoting each other, but also can give full play to the potential and enthusiasm of each factory and mine. This form is more often adopted in the Lushun-Dalian and Jinzhou areas. (3) "Large-scale hook-up." That is, according to the uneven distribution of industry in the province, on the basis of factory-commune hook-ups in various cities, breaking through the boundaries between cities, conducting comprehensive arrangements, and adopting the method of the strong leading the weak and the large leading the small. Five cities with a strong industrial base, such as Shenyang, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, and Benxi, selected a group of factories and mines to link up with 90 rural people's communes in cities with a relatively weak industrial base, such as Chaoyang, Yingkou, Andong, and Jinzhou. This has created favorable conditions for promoting the balanced development of agricultural technical transformation in the province. (4) With the widespread development of the national movement to support agriculture, on the original basis of factory-commune hook-ups, various cities have further taken industry as the center, with the original linked factories as the main body, and backbone factories as the group leaders, and have absorbed transportation, postal and telecommunications, commerce, finance, culture, education, health, science, and technology units to participate, forming cooperation committees to support agriculture, and "jointly hook-up" with counties and communes, unifying planning, comprehensively arranging, and comprehensively supporting. In Shenyang alone, more than 800 units in industry, finance and trade, culture, education, health, science, and technology have uniformly formed 92 grassroots committees to support agriculture with nine counties, one suburban area, and 92 rural people's communes.

In order to strengthen the leadership of supporting agriculture, at present, the provincial, municipal, and county party committees and large-scale factories and mines have established specialized agencies and assigned special personnel to be responsible. All factories and mines have helped communes formulate plans for agricultural technical transformation, and have jointly consulted with communes to formulate support plans for factories and mines, and regularly sign "agreements" to ensure the implementation of the plans.

The development of the mass movement of all walks of life supporting agriculture has greatly accelerated the process of agricultural technical transformation and promoted the development of current agricultural production. In view of the fact that agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plants are an important base for promoting agricultural technical transformation, all factories and mines have actively helped rural people's communes build agricultural machinery repair plants, actively clearing warehouses to tap potential, taking out a batch of machine tools, tools, power equipment, and waste materials, and helping communes install and produce. Four hundred and twenty-seven agricultural machinery repair plants have been built in 460 rural people's communes throughout the province. In addition, all factories and mines have helped communes train more than 9,350 technical workers of various types, and have also sent more than 7,000 technical workers to communes to provide technical guidance. Since the beginning of this year, more than 830,000 semi-mechanized and improved tools of various types have been reformed and promoted in rural areas throughout the province, more than doubling the number in the same period last year. In the past, the Ronghuashan People's Commune in Zhuanghe County, a remote mountainous area, had to travel 70 miles to the county seat to repair a broken farm tool. This year, with the help of the Dalian Shipyard, it built its own machinery repair factory, manufacturing more than 300 shovel-weeding machines and various seeders, which greatly accelerated the progress of spring sowing and weeding compared with previous years. Since the beginning of summer, severe insect plagues and weed infestations have been universally discovered in rural areas throughout the province. The urban support army and rural commune members worked together to develop indigenous machinery and indigenous pesticides, and quickly basically eliminated the armyworm pest, and in one fell swoop eliminated 400,000 mu of weed infestation.

Hefei, July 25th (By our reporter) Industrial departments in various parts of Anhui have adopted methods such as matching large and small factories, uniting small factories, and matching specialties to uniformly adjust factory-commune relations, greatly strengthening industrial support for agricultural technical transformation.

At present, more than 80% of factories and mines in Anhui Province have been linked to people's communes, and the communes linked account for more than 90% of the total number of rural communes in the province. Anqing City has matched 96 factories into nine cooperation groups to support agriculture, which are linked to nine communes respectively; in Bengbu Prefecture, many counties have organized small factories to jointly support agriculture, which has greatly enhanced the support force. For example, in order to rush-produce irrigation and drainage machinery to support rural areas, the Hefei Municipal Industrial Department organized 18 factories to jointly produce, giving full play to the strengths of each factory and helping each other with what they have and don't have, so that the products are complete. When the Chezhan District Machinery Factory was assembling water pumps, it lacked drill bits, so the Mining Machinery Factory sent drill bits to support it; after completing the manufacturing task of water pumps, the Valve Factory immediately transferred some equipment to support the Dongshiqu People's Iron Factory. With this spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual exchange, the workers rushed to produce more than 40,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, and achieved the goal of manufacturing one unit, assembling one unit, and transporting one unit.

The result of matching large and small factories and uniting small factories to build agricultural machinery to support agriculture is that the production materials provided to agriculture in the first half of this year have greatly increased compared with the same period last year. The province has produced more than 1.24 million pieces of advanced agricultural tools for irrigation and drainage machinery, processing, threshing, cultivation, and sowing, and more than 370,000 vehicles for transportation tools such as handcarts and flatbed trucks, of which the output of handcarts alone is more than 11% higher than the output of the entire year last year. The output of chemical fertilizers in the first half of the year increased by 63 times compared with the same period last year, and the output of pesticides also increased by more than one time compared with the same period last year. At the same time, various places have also drawn out technical forces to help communes repair agricultural machinery while helping build factories. According to statistics from Huainan City and Bengbu Prefecture alone, factories and mines have helped rural communes set up more than 770 small factories. The steel workers in Ma'anshan City also provided equipment, technology, and raw materials to help a suburban commune build a phosphate fertilizer factory. Using steel slag as raw material, it has produced more than 1,600 tons of phosphate fertilizer.

Factories and mines in various places have also adopted various methods such as running technical training classes and sending technicians to the countryside to impart technology, and enthusiastically trained technical forces for rural people's communes. According to incomplete statistics from Hefei, Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Huainan and other cities and Wuhu, Anqing, Fuyang, Bengbu and other prefectures, more than 30,000 technical personnel have been trained for rural people's communes. All factories in Hefei City that manufacture agricultural machinery for rural communes have adopted the method of taking responsibility to the end, helping commune members master the technology of operation, installation, and repair. Now, more than 20 people's communes in the three counties under the division of labor in the city have technical workers in every team.

At present, in order to further improve the work of industrial support for agriculture, the party committees in various places have established leading groups for supporting agriculture in special districts and cities and counties, and set up offices under them to strengthen specific leadership. Many factories and mines have also established leading organizations to support agriculture, with the party committee secretary or factory director personally taking command.

Harbin, July 25th (By our reporter) Harbin's support for agricultural technical transformation has developed from the initial "factories leading communes, factory-commune hook-ups" to the form of "urban communes leading counties, factories leading communes, factory-commune hook-ups, all-inclusive responsibility," organizing urban communes, large factories, small and medium-sized factories, industry, and other industries to support agriculture in a more planned, step-by-step, comprehensive, and systematic manner.

Now, the seven people's communes in Harbin have established comprehensive cooperation relations with the surrounding eight counties of Hulan, Acheng, Shuangcheng, Wuchang, and Bayan, respectively; and more than 200 large and medium-sized factories such as Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, Forestry Machinery Plant, and Boiler Plant have established long-term cooperation relations with 174 rural people's communes in 21 counties such as Shangzhi, Hailun, and Zhaodong. Each urban commune has organized visiting groups centered on factories and enterprises, including all walks of life, to go deep into the counties they are responsible for. Through investigation and understanding, they jointly studied and formulated a comprehensive support plan combining long-term development and immediate needs with the county party committee, and implemented the support projects to relevant units such as factories and enterprises. At present, the urban communes are arranging forces and taking active actions in accordance with the agricultural support plan that has been implemented.

In the support of rural areas, the urban communes in Harbin are starting with the projects that are most urgently needed by the rural areas. For example, in order to save more labor, counties and communes are in urgent need of solving the problem of power sources. The Harbin Power Township People's Commune organized seven large factories, including Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Steam Turbine Plant, and some small factories, to support Zhaodong, Bayan, Bin County, and other counties to build power stations of 1,500 kilowatts to 3,000 kilowatts respectively. Now, two 1,500-kilowatt power stations in Zhaodong County are about to be completed. The livestock husbandry collectively raised by various counties and communes originally occupied a relatively large amount of labor. The urban communes in Harbin organized factories to actively help the rural communes' livestock husbandry carry out tool reforms and increase semi-mechanized equipment.

Due to the efforts of various counties and the planned and systematic support of the urban communes, the eight counties near Harbin have now established agricultural machinery factories, small motor factories, small chemical factories producing phosphate and potash fertilizers and agro-livestock medicines, small cement factories, and brick and tile factories that can manufacture general agricultural machinery and various non-field operation machinery. Many counties are running small-scale iron smelting plants. During this year's spring plowing and summer hoeing, the various spring plowing seeders, corn and soybean planters, mechanized towed agricultural implements, and a large number of improved agricultural implements newly added to these counties are generally manufactured by these newly built factories in the county.

    不断地加强工农联盟　不断地加强支援农业
    “厂社挂钩”越发丰富多彩
    辽宁　以挂钩工厂为主吸收各单位组成支援委员会，更好地促进农业技术改造
    安徽　采取大小厂搭配、小厂联合、专业对口等办法，统一调整厂社挂钩关系
    哈尔滨　以城市公社带县、以厂带社、厂社挂钩、一包到底，全面系统支援农业
    本报沈阳25日电　我国重要工业基地辽宁省实行的“厂社挂钩”支援农业技术改造的好形式，目前又有了新的发展，一个以工业为主体各行各业全面支援农业的新高潮正在深入展开。现在全省已有二千一百三十二个工厂矿山、交通邮电、商业金融、科学技术、文教卫生等单位积极投入支援农业的活动。各地纷纷组成了支援农业的合作委员会，与县、社联合挂钩，统一规划，全面安排，固定支援，一包到底。
    根据不同的情况，辽宁各地厂社挂钩目前已发展为四种形式。（一）一厂包一社。这种形式的好处是：对象固定，责任明确，任务具体。（二）数厂包一社或数厂包数社。即把几个厂矿企业编成一个大组，与一个或数个公社挂钩，由一个骨干厂当组长。这种形式不仅便于各厂矿企业分工协作，取长补短，调剂有无，互相促进，且能充分发挥各厂矿企业的潜力和积极性，这种形式在旅大、锦州地区采用较多。（三）“大挂钩”。即根据全省工业分布不平衡的情况，在各市厂社挂钩的基础上，冲破市与市的界限，进行全面安排，采取以强带弱和以大带小的办法，由沈阳、鞍山、旅大、抚顺、本溪等工业基础较强的五个市选派一批厂矿企业，分别与工业基础较弱的朝阳、营口、安东、锦州等市的九十个农村人民公社挂钩，这为促进全省农业技术改造的平衡发展创造了有利条件。（四）随着支援农业的全民性运动的广泛开展，目前各市在厂社挂钩的原有基础上，进一步以工业为中心，以原有挂钩厂为主体，骨干厂为组长，又吸收交通邮电、商业金融、文教卫生、科学技术等单位参加，组成支援农业的合作委员会，和县、社“联合挂钩”，统一规划，全面安排，全面支援。仅沈阳市工业、财贸、文教卫生、科学技术等八百多个单位，就已经和九个县、一个郊区、九十二个农村人民公社统一组成了九十二个基层支援农业委员会。
    为了加强对支援农业的领导，目前，省、市、县党委和大型厂矿企业都建立了专门机构，确定专人负责。各厂矿企业都帮助公社制订了农业技术改造的规划，并与公社共同协商制订了厂矿企业的支援规划，定期签订“协议书”，以保证规划的贯彻执行。
    各行各业支援农业的群众运动的开展，大大加速了农业技术改造的进程，促进了当前农业生产的发展。鉴于农业机械修配制造厂是促进农业技术改造的一个重要基地，因此各厂矿企业都积极帮助农村人民公社建设农业机具修配厂，纷纷清理仓库挖掘潜力，拿出一批机床、工具、动力设备和废旧材料，并帮助公社安装、生产，全省农村四百六十个人民公社，已建起了四百二十七处农业机具修配厂。此外，各厂矿企业还帮助各公社培养出各种技术工人九千三百五十多名，同时还派出七千多名技术工人到公社做技术指导。今年以来全省农村已改革推广各种半机械化和改良工具八十三万多件，比去年同期增加一倍以上。位于偏僻山区的庄河县蓉花山人民公社，过去坏一件农具就要走七十里路到县城去修理，今年在大连造船厂的帮助下，建成了自己的机修厂，制造了三百多台铲趟机和各种播种机，使春播和铲趟进度比往年大大加快。入夏以来，全省农村普遍发现严重的虫灾和草荒。城市支援大军和农村社员一起，大搞土机械和土农药，很快就基本上扑灭了虫害夜盗虫，又一举突击消灭了四十万垧草荒。
    本报合肥25日电　安徽各地工业部门采取大小厂搭配、小厂联合、专业对口等办法，统一调整了厂社挂钩关系，大大加强了工业对农业技术改造的支援。
    现在安徽全省80％以上的厂矿企业已分别与人民公社挂了钩，被挂钩的公社占全省农村公社总数的90％以上。安庆市把九十六个工厂搭配成九个支援农业的合作小组，分别与九个公社挂钩；蚌埠专区很多县把小厂组织起来，联合支援农业，这样就大大增强了支援力量。如合肥市工业部门为了赶制排灌机械支援农村，就组织了十八个厂联合生产，发挥各厂所长，以有帮无，使产品配套。车站区机械厂在装配水泵时缺少钻头，矿山机械厂就拿钻头去支援；阀门厂在完成水泵的制造任务后，立即调出部分设备支援东市区人民铁工厂。职工们就是以这种相互协作、互通有无的精神，赶制出了四万多马力的排灌机械，并且做到制造一台、装配一台、调运一台。
    采取大小厂搭配起来，小厂联合起来大造农业机械支援农业的结果，今年半年多来给农业提供的生产资料比去年同期大大增多。全省已生产出排灌机械以及加工、脱粒、耕作、播种等先进农具一百二十四万多件，手推车和平板车等运输工具三十七万多辆，其中仅手推车的产量就比去年全年的产量还多11％以上。上半年生产的化肥比去年同期增加六十三倍，农药产量也比去年同期增加一倍以上。同时各地还抽出技术力量，一边帮助公社修理农业机械，一边帮助建工厂。仅据淮南市和蚌埠专区两地统计，厂矿企业就帮助农村公社办起了七百七十多个小型工厂。马鞍山市的钢铁工人，还提供设备、技术、原料，帮助郊区公社建起了一座磷肥厂，用钢渣作原料，已生产了磷肥一千六百多吨。
    各地厂矿企业还采取办技术训练班、派技工下乡传授技术等各种办法，热情地为农村人民公社培训技术力量。据合肥、安庆、芜湖、蚌埠、淮南等市和芜湖、安庆、阜阳、蚌埠等专区不完全统计，已为农村人民公社培训了三万多名技术人材。合肥市凡是为农村公社制造农业机械的工厂，都采取包到底的办法，帮助社员掌握操作、安装、修理等技术，现在这个市分工包干的三个县的二十多个人民公社，队队都有了技术工人。
    目前，各地党委为了进一步做好工业支援农业的工作，专区和市、县都建立了支援农业的领导小组，下设办公室，加强具体领导。许多厂矿企业也建立了支援农业的领导机构，由党委书记或厂长亲自挂帅。
    本报哈尔滨25日电　哈尔滨市支援农业技术改造已经由初期的“以厂带社、厂社挂钩”，发展到“以城市公社带县、以厂带社、厂社挂钩、一包到底”的形式，把城市公社的大工厂和中小工厂，工业和其他各行各业都组织起来，更有计划有步骤的全面系统的支援农业。
    现在，哈尔滨市的七个人民公社都已分别与周围的呼兰、阿城、双城、五常、巴彦等八个县建立了全面协作的关系；还有哈尔滨车辆厂、林业机械厂、锅炉厂等二百来个大中型工厂与尚志、海伦、肇东等二十一个县的一百七十四个农村人民公社建立了长期的协作关系。各城市公社组织了以工厂企业为中心，包括各行各业的访问团深入到所包各县，通过调查了解，与县委共同研究制订出了长远发展和近期需要相结合的全面支援规划，并将支援项目落实到工厂、企业等有关单位。目前，各城市公社正在按照已经落实的支援农业规划，安排力量，积极行动。
    哈尔滨各城市公社在对农村的支援中，都是从当前农村最迫切需要的项目入手。比如，各县社为了节省出更多的劳动力，都急需解决动力来源问题。哈尔滨动力之乡人民公社就组织了哈尔滨电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂等七个大厂和一些小厂，支援肇东、巴彦、宾县等县分别建立一千五百瓩到三千瓩的发电站。现在，肇东县的两个一千五百瓩的发电站即将建成。各县、社集体饲养的畜牧业，原来一般都占用较多的劳动力，哈尔滨各城市公社就组织各工厂积极帮助农村公社畜牧业进行工具改革，增加半机械化设备。
    由于各县的努力和城市公社有计划、有系统的支援，现在哈尔滨附近八个县都已建立起能制造一般农业机具和各种非田间作业机械的农业机械厂、小电机厂、生产磷钾肥和农畜药的小型化工厂、小型水泥厂、砖瓦厂。许多县都在兴办小洋群的炼铁厂。今年春耕和夏锄中，这些县新添的各种春耕播种机，苞米、大豆点种机，机械化拖带农具，以及大量改良农具等，一般都是靠本县新建的这些工厂制造的。
