　　Singing a Mountain Song to Thank Wuhan Iron and Steel
　　Zhu Cunyi, member of Beihu Commune, Qingshan District, Wuhan:
　　Waves of wheat roll and rape flowers are fragrant,
　　Singing a mountain song to thank Wuhan Iron and Steel.
　　Worker brothers' friendship is deep,
　　Carrying night soil to the farm at night.
　　Frog sounds "guoguo" everywhere,
　　Fertilizer carts and horses fill the ridges.
　　A load of manure is a load of gold,
　　A cart of fertilizer is a cart of affection.
　　Cuckoo's voice echoes on the hilltop,
　　Spring plowing and spring sowing are busy and bustling.
　　Worker-peasant brothers support each other,
　　Flowers of friendship bloom fragrantly.

　　唱个山歌谢武钢
　　武汉青山区北湖公社社员　朱存仪麦浪滚滚菜花香，唱个山歌谢武钢，工人大哥情谊重，黑夜挑肥送农庄。蛙声啯啯四处鸣，送肥车马闹满垅，一担大粪一担金，一车肥料一车情。布谷声声响山岗，春耕春播忙又忙，工农兄弟互支援，友谊花开朵朵香。
