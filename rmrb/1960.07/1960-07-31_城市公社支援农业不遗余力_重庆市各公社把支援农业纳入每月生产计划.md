　　(本报讯) Since the establishment of people's communes in the streets of Chongqing this year, a new situation has emerged in which urban people support agricultural production. The Party committees of all communes regard supporting agricultural production as one of their main production tasks; they unifiedly arrange forces to lead commune members to actively support agricultural production. Every month, when arranging production, many factories in various communes undertake certain tasks of supporting agricultural production materials, and regularly check the completion. Qixinggang People's Commune and Chuqimen People's Commune specifically concentrated technicians and extracted machines to produce 200 rice transplanters day and night for rural areas. Many factories in urban people's communes such as Xiaolongkan, Daping, Shapingba, Youyi, and Shuangbei rushed to produce more than 58,000 pieces of farm tools of 74 types, which were transported to rural areas in a timely manner. The employees of the chemical plants of many communes are very enthusiastic, and also specialize in producing high-quality fertilizers and efficient insecticides for agricultural production.

　　Because urban communes can uniformly deploy forces, support for rural areas in terms of manpower is more timely, and planning is greatly enhanced. Several people's communes in the urban area have transferred more than 300 workers and commune members to support the water conservancy project in Qijiang County, a suburb of the city. In order not to increase the burden on rural areas, they also equipped medical staff, cooks, barbers, etc. to go to the countryside to take on the living service work of the construction site. After the workers went to the countryside, they participated in construction work on the one hand, and trained more than 370 stonemasons for rural communes on the spot. This year, with the development of the rural pig raising industry, a large number of pigsties are urgently needed, but rural areas lack construction workers. Many urban people's communes have transferred stonemasons and carpenters to support the construction of pig farms in rural areas.

　　The enthusiastic support of urban people's communes has further strengthened the deep friendship between commune members of urban communes and commune members of rural people's communes. Rural people's communes in the suburbs also actively help urban people's communes establish farms and guide vegetable planting and pig raising techniques. Many communes have allocated land for urban communes to grow vegetables and raise pigs. Daping People's Commune has established a 90-mu farm in the countryside. With the support and help of rural communes in the suburbs, this farm has recently produced more than 60,000 jin of vegetables, and the commune's 16 commune canteens have achieved partial self-sufficiency in vegetables. Due to the increasing variety and quantity of production materials needed by rural communes, and the continuous improvement of quality requirements, it has also promoted the rapid development of urban commune industry.

    城市公社支援农业不遗余力
    重庆市各公社把支援农业纳入每月生产计划
    本报讯　今年重庆全市街道建立人民公社后，在城市人民支援农业生产方面出现了新的局面。各个公社党委把支援农业生产作为主要生产任务之一；统一安排力量领导社员积极支援农业生产。每月在安排生产时，各个公社的许多工厂都要担任一定支援农业生产资料的任务，并且定期检查完成情况。七星岗人民公社和储奇门人民公社专门集中技工，抽出机器，日夜为农村突击生产了二百台插秧机。小龙坎、大坪、沙坪坝、友谊、双碑等城市人民公社的许多工厂赶制了七十四种五万八千多件农具，及时运往农村。许多公社的化工厂的职工热情很高，还专门为农业生产优质肥料和高效杀虫药剂。
    由于城市公社能统一调配力量，在人力上支援农村更加及时，计划性大大增强。城区的几个人民公社抽调了三百多名工人、社员支援市郊綦江县兴修水利工程。他们为了不增加农村负担，还配备医务人员、炊事员、理发员等下乡，担负工地的生活服务工作。工人们下乡后，一面参加修建工作，一面又就地为农村公社培养了三百七十多名石工。今年农村养猪事业的发展，大批猪圈急需兴建，而农村又缺乏建筑工人。不少城市人民公社便抽调石工、木工支援农村兴办养猪场。
    城市人民公社的热情支援，更加密切了城市公社社员与农村人民公社社员间的深厚友谊。市郊各区的农村人民公社也积极帮助城市各个人民公社建立农场，指导种菜养猪技术。许多公社划出土地让城市公社种菜养猪。大坪人民公社已在农村建立了一个九十亩地的农场。这个农场在市郊农村公社的支援、帮助下，最近已生产了六万多斤蔬菜，公社的十六个公社食堂做到了吃菜部分自给。由于农村公社需要的生产资料的品种和数量增多，质量要求不断提高，也促进城市公社工业的迅速发展。
