    Bringing Pesticides and Equipment to the Fields
    After concluding the first campaign to prevent and control wheat diseases and pests, commercial departments in Hubei Province are now cooperating with agricultural departments to carry out the second campaign to prevent and control cotton and rice diseases and pests. After organizing the supply of chemical pesticides and equipment, commercial departments at all levels, led by leading cadres, are launching a delivery campaign to bring pesticides and equipment to production teams and fields. By the end of June, the supply of chemical pesticides to rural areas had reached more than 7,300 tons and more than 37,700 pieces of equipment. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, commercial employees also helped communes produce indigenous pesticides on a large scale. Currently, the province has produced more than 40,000 tons of indigenous pesticides. These indigenous pesticides have played a significant role in preventing and controlling diseases and pests.

    把农药药械送到田间
    湖北省商业部门在结束小麦病虫害防治的第一战役以后，现在正配合农业部门开展棉花、水稻病虫害防治的第二战役。各级商业部门在组织好化学农药和药械的货源以后，由领导干部们带头开展送货运动，将农药和药械送到生产队和田间。到6月底，供应农村的化学农药已达七千三百多吨。药械三万七千七百多架。商业职工在党委领导下，还帮助公社大制土农药。目前，全省已生产土农药四万多吨。这些土农药对防治病虫害都发挥很大作用。
