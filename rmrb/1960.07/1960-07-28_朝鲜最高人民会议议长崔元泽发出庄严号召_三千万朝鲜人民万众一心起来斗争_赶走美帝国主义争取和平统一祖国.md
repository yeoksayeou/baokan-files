    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th: Choi Won-taek, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, wrote in yesterday's "Democratic Korea" newspaper that American imperialism must be forced to get out of South Korea, and Korea must be peacefully reunified so that the South Korean people can escape poverty and restore their rights.

    Choi Won-taek condemned the American imperialists for using the method of propping up the Heo Jeong group to restore Lee Seung-man-style rule, and attempting to stage the election farce on July 29th to deceive the people in order to maintain the American imperialists' colonial rule in South Korea.

    Choi Won-taek also condemned the upper echelons of the South Korean "Democratic Party" for now desperately trying to seize the puppet regime through the upcoming "election." He pointed out that the heads of the "Democratic Party," a group of pro-American and pro-Japanese elements headed by Chang Myon, are trying to make the South Korean people believe that they are on the side of the South Korean people, thereby covering up their treasonous crimes committed in collusion with the Lee Seung-man traitorous clique.

    Choi Won-taek said that the South Korean people's life experiences over the past fifteen years and the current situation in South Korea show that as long as conservative political brokers continue to occupy the puppet regime, no matter what political faction they represent, the South Korean people's situation cannot be improved, and their misfortune and suffering cannot end.

    Choi Won-taek emphasized that therefore, the upper echelons of the "Democratic Party" and other reactionary conservative forces who serve the American imperialist policy of aggression must not be allowed to infiltrate the government through the July 29th "election." He also said that the peaceful reunification of the country is the only way to help the South Korean people.

    Choi Won-taek said that the thirty million Korean people, regardless of religious belief and political views, should unite as one and stand up to fight for contact, negotiations, economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea, and for holding general elections nationwide based on democratic principles. He said that the enemy must not be allowed to continue to manipulate the fate of the motherland and the future of the nation. American imperialism must go back. The artificial barriers between North and South Korea must be eliminated. The united Korean people should peacefully reunify their own country themselves.

    朝鲜最高人民会议议长崔元泽发出庄严号召
    三千万朝鲜人民万众一心起来斗争  赶走美帝国主义争取和平统一祖国
    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议议长崔元泽在昨天的“民主朝鲜报”上写道，必须迫使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜，朝鲜必须和平统一，以便使南朝鲜人民摆脱贫困和恢复他们的权利。
    崔元泽谴责美帝国主义者用捧许政集团上台的办法来恢复李承晚式的统治，并且企图导演7月29日的选举丑剧，来欺骗人民，以便保持美帝国主义者在南朝鲜的殖民统治。
    崔元泽还谴责南朝鲜“民主党”上层分子现在拚命想通过即将举行的“选举”来掌握傀儡政权。他指出，“民主党”的头子们，是以张勉为首的一批亲美和亲日分子，他们企图使南朝鲜人民相信，他们是站在南朝鲜人民这一边的，借此掩盖他们同李承晚卖国集团狼狈为奸所干下的卖国罪行。
    崔元泽说，南朝鲜人民过去十五年的生活经历和目前南朝鲜的局势表明，只要保守的政治掮客继续盘踞在傀儡政权中，不管他们代表什么政治派别，南朝鲜人民的处境就不能改善，他们的不幸和苦难也不能结束。
    崔元泽强调说，因此，决不能容许为美帝国主义侵略政策效劳的“民主党”上层分子和其他反动保守势力通过7月29日“选举”混进政权。他又说，国家的和平统一是帮助南朝鲜人民的唯一办法。
    崔元泽说，三千万朝鲜人民，不论宗教信仰和政见如何，应该万众一心地站起来，为南北朝鲜之间的接触、谈判、经济和文化往来以及为根据民主原则在全国举行大选而斗争。他说，不准敌人继续摆布祖国的命运和民族的前途。美帝国主义必须滚回去。南北朝鲜之间的人为障碍必须消除。团结一致的朝鲜人民应该自己来和平统一自己的国家。
