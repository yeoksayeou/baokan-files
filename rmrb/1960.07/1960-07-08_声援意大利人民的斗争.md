    Support the Struggle of the Italian People
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    A bloody incident occurred on the 6th in Rome, the capital of Italy, where police brutally suppressed patriotic people. This bloody atrocity by the Italian government completely exposed its reactionary face as an enemy of the people. The Chinese people are deeply concerned about the patriotic and just anti-fascist struggle of the Italian people, and express angry protest against the barbaric atrocities of the reactionary Italian government!
    This is not the first time that the reactionary Italian government has resorted to violent suppression of the people's anti-fascist actions. On June 25th, police surrounded demonstrating crowds in Genoa, injuring fifty people and arresting nine. On June 30th, police attacked strikers in Genoa again, causing more than thirty injuries. On July 5th, in the town of Licata in Sicily, 20,000 people held an anti-government demonstration, and the police actually opened fire on the demonstrators, killing one young worker and injuring dozens. Italian patriotic people and guerrillas who once fought against fascism held a demonstration in St. Paul's Square in Rome on the 6th to protest the government's ban on anti-fascist gatherings. Unexpectedly, this patriotic action was attacked by 2,000 policemen, injuring more than 100 people and arresting 600. This fully shows that the reactionary Italian government is standing on the side of fascist forces. It is equally clear that the recent rampant behavior of Italian fascists is precisely the result of the Italian reactionary government's connivance. And the methods adopted by the Italian government in Rome on the 6th against patriotic people were thoroughly fascist.
    The bloody incident in Rome shows that Italy is indeed facing a serious threat from fascism. In order to maintain its reactionary rule over the people, the Italian ruling group is attempting to follow Mussolini's old path. But the Italian people, who have suffered from fascist disasters and have a glorious tradition of anti-fascist struggle, will not allow the Italian reactionaries to manipulate them at will. The new atrocities of the reactionary Italian government in Rome can only arouse greater anger among the Italian people and prompt them to carry out the struggle more resolutely. Workers in Rome and other cities have launched strikes one after another to support the anti-fascist demonstrations. An anti-fascist struggle wave is rising throughout Italy. More than a decade ago, Mussolini could not escape being hanged in Milan by patriotic people. Today, with the greatly enhanced awareness of the Italian people, all fascist remnants who dare to make a comeback will never have a better fate.

    声援意大利人民的斗争
    本报评论员
    6日在意大利首都罗马发生了警察残酷镇压爱国人民的流血事件。意大利政府的这种血腥暴行完全暴露了它与人民为敌的反动面目。中国人民十分关切意大利人民爱国正义的反法西斯斗争，对于意大利反动政府的野蛮暴行，表示愤怒的抗议！
    意大利反动政府对人民反法西斯行动采取暴力镇压手段，这已不是第一次。6月25日，警察包围了热那亚的示威群众，打伤五十人，逮捕九人。6月30日，警察又袭击热那亚的罢工者，造成了三十多人受伤。7月5日，西西里岛上的利卡塔镇，有两万人举行反政府示威，警察竟向示威群众开枪，有一名青年工人被打死，数十人受伤。意大利的爱国人民以及曾为反法西斯而战的游击队员们，为了抗议政府禁止反法西斯集会，6日在罗马圣保罗广场举行示威，不料这一爱国行动，竟遭到二千名警察的袭击，一百多人被打伤，六百人被逮捕。这就充分表明了意大利反动政府是站在法西斯势力一边的。同样清楚的是，意大利法西斯分子近来所以如此猖獗，正是因为受到意大利反动政府纵容的结果。而意大利政府6日在罗马对爱国人民所采取的也正是十足的法西斯手段。
    罗马的流血事件表明，意大利的确面临着法西斯的严重威胁。意大利的统治集团为了要维持它对人民的反动统治，正在企图走墨索里尼的老路。但是曾经饱受法西斯祸害并且有着反法西斯斗争光荣传统的意大利人民，是不会任由意大利的反动派随意摆布的。意大利反动政府在罗马的新暴行，只能激起意大利人民更大的愤怒，促使他们更加坚决地进行斗争。罗马和其他城市的工人已纷纷举行罢工，声援反法西斯示威。一个反法西斯的斗争浪潮正在意大利各地兴起。既然十多年前，墨索里尼免不了被爱国人民吊死在米兰，在意大利人民的觉悟已大大提高的今天，一切法西斯余孽如果胆敢东山再起，也绝不会有更好的命运。
