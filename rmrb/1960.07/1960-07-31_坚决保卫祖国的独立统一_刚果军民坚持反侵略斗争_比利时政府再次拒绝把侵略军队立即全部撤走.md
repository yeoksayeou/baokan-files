Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Elisabethville: In the Katanga province of the Congo, which is under Belgian military occupation, local people are increasingly opposed to the traitorous actions of province governor Moise Tshombe, an agent of foreign monopoly capital, who is trying to split the Congo's territory and undermine Congolese independence and unity.

Earlier, under the planning of Belgian and other imperialists, Tshombe had declared Katanga province to be "independent" from the Congo, and on the 29th sent a delegation to the United Nations and Belgium to raise the so-called issue of Katanga province's "independence."

This Tshombe group, supported by the bayonets of the occupying army, in order to suppress the people's patriotic and just struggle, in addition to announcing a ban on any protests and demonstrations and gatherings of more than five people, also arrested six patriots on the evening of the 28th who firmly opposed its conspiracy to split the Congo. Even the police, commanded by Belgian officers, were armed and on alert, ready to move out at any time to suppress any "demonstrations and disturbances." According to Western news agencies, the situation in Elisabethville is "certainly tense."

In Kasongo, Kivu province, the struggle of Congolese soldiers and civilians against provocations by the Belgian aggressor troops is continuing.

At the same time, it is reported that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjold, who is currently active in the Congo, participated in a meeting of the Congolese cabinet on the 29th, where he actually asked the Congolese government to exercise "restraint and patience" on the issue of opposing Katanga province's secession from the Congo. Some Congolese ministers expressed dissatisfaction with Hammarskjold's attitude. The news said that some Congolese ministers had expressed to Hammarskjold at the meeting, as well as to the American Bunch, who also attended the meeting and commanded the UN forces, that they only hoped that the UN forces could drive the Belgian aggressor troops out of the Congo, and that the Congolese would solve the economic problems themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Brussels: The Belgian government stated once again on the 29th that Belgium has no intention of immediately withdrawing all of its aggressor troops from the Congo.

After holding a cabinet meeting yesterday morning, the Belgian cabinet announced that, in consideration of the entry of UN forces into the Congo and the measures taken, the Belgian government is prepared to withdraw 1,500 troops from the approximately 10,000 troops it has sent to the Congo "in the coming days." However, the Belgian cabinet made no indication whatsoever of preparing to completely withdraw its troops from the Congo, and according to Belgian Defense Minister Gilson at a press conference on the same day, whether Belgium will withdraw its troops will also depend on whether "Europeans in the Congo" receive so-called "actual protection." He believes that there are not enough UN forces at present to replace the Belgian colonial army.

He also emphasized that the Belgian government has no intention of abandoning its bases in the Congo, such as Kamina and Kitona. According to Gilson, Belgian troops in the Congo currently occupy twenty-five major areas of the Congo.

    坚决保卫祖国的独立统一
    刚果军民坚持反侵略斗争
    比利时政府再次拒绝把侵略军队立即全部撤走
    新华社30日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：在比利时军事占领下的刚果加丹加省，当地人民反对该省省长、外国垄断资本代理人冲伯的分裂刚果领土、破坏刚果独立和统一的卖国行为的情绪日益增长。
    早些时候，冲伯在比利时等帝国主义策划下曾宣布加丹加省脱离刚果而“独立”，并且在29日派代表团去联合国和比利时，提出所谓加丹加省“独立”问题。
    这个由占领军刺刀支持的冲伯集团，为了镇压人民的爱国正义斗争，除宣布禁止任何抗议示威和五人以上的集会外，在28日晚还逮捕了坚决反对它分裂刚果阴谋的六名爱国者。连由比利时军官指挥的警察也都武装起来，处于戒备状态，准备随时出动镇压任何“示威和骚乱”。据西方通讯社报道，伊利沙伯维尔的局势“肯定紧张”。
    在基伍省的卡松果，刚果军民反对比利时侵略军挑衅的斗争仍在继续中。
    同时，据报道，正在刚果活动的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德29日参加了刚果内阁的会议，他在会上竟就要求刚果政府在反对加丹加省从刚果分裂出去的问题上“节制和忍耐”。一些刚果部长对哈马舍尔德的这种态度表示不满。消息说，一些刚果部长曾在会上向哈马舍尔德以及也参加了会议的、指挥联合国军的美国人本奇表示，他们只希望联合国军能从刚果赶走比利时侵略军，经济问题由刚果自己解决。
    新华社30日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时政府29日又一次表示，比利时无意立即把它的侵略军队全部撤出刚果。
    比利时内阁在昨天上午举行一次会议后宣布，考虑到联合国部队进入刚果及其所采取的措施，比利时政府准备“在今后几天内”从它派往刚果的约一万名军队中调回一千五百人。但是，比利时内阁却丝毫没有准备从刚果全部撤军的表示，而且据比利时国防大臣纪耳松同一天在记者招待会上说，比利时是否撤军还将要看“在刚果的欧洲人”是否得到所谓“实际的保护”而定。他认为，目前还没有足够的联合国部队来代替比利时殖民军。
    他还强调说，比利时政府无意放弃它在刚果的加米纳和基托纳等基地。据纪耳松说，目前比利时在刚果的军队占领着刚果的二十五个主要地区。
