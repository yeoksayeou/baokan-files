　　Main and Auxiliary
　　Chen Zhiyan
    Main means primary; auxiliary means secondary. Obviously, the main is more important than the auxiliary. The main is the commander, and the auxiliary serves the main. However, when we observe and think about problems, we must not regard the relationships between things as fixed, rigid, and unchangeable. For example, main and auxiliary: under normal circumstances, the main is decisive. Without the leading aspect, there is no such thing as an auxiliary aspect. However, in other cases, the auxiliary may become decisive; without the auxiliary, the main cannot be used.
    This is not an abstract relationship issue, but a problem that we often encounter in real life. For example, in our industrial production, how to correctly treat the main and auxiliary is a very important issue.
    Power generating equipment and steel rolling equipment have main engines and auxiliary engines; the composition of automobiles, tractors, and other agricultural machinery also have main parts, accessories, and attachments. Any set of power generating equipment must have a complete set of main and auxiliary engines to generate electricity; any car must also have the necessary accessories and attachments for assembly and maintenance. Here, the main and auxiliary are interdependent; neither can leave the other. Under normal circumstances, the main engine and main parts are the main aspects of the contradiction, but from the current point of view, auxiliary engines and accessories have become a major problem. Why? Main engines and main parts have larger bodies and higher output value, and are the main bodies of equipment and machinery, like the main trunk of a large tree, which easily attracts people's attention. Therefore, some major factories are often arranged, and in a factory, the main workshops are arranged to produce main engines and main parts. Priority is often given to the supply of raw materials and technical forces. These practices are all correct; we must grasp the main aspects in doing anything. However, this does not mean that secondary and auxiliary aspects are not important. The problem arises precisely here. In the previous period, some enterprises, because auxiliary engines, accessories, and attachments had small parts, many specifications, were labor-intensive, and had low output value, were not as active or valued in the production of auxiliary engines and accessories as they were in the production of main engines and main parts. As a result, the complete sets of some equipment were affected, and the maintenance of some cars, tractors, and other agricultural machinery was also affected. In this case, the contradiction has been transformed, and auxiliary engines and accessories have become prominent problems, becoming problems that enterprise leaders need to grasp greatly, specifically, and concretely.
    We have an experience that any problem, as long as we take specific measures and seriously grasp it, it can be said that the problem can definitely be solved. We are very pleased that the production of auxiliary engines and accessories has been valued by many places, is being grasped greatly, and has achieved very good results. Please read the report published in this newspaper today: From Harbin in the north to Guangzhou in the south, from Yumen in the west to Shanghai in the east, under the guidance of supporting agriculture and the idea of the whole country as a single chessboard, and greatly promoting the communist style, large numbers of auxiliary engines and accessories have been manufactured. As a result, large numbers of equipment and machines have been quickly assembled and left the factory, and the number of cars and tractors awaiting repair has been greatly reduced.
    The contradiction between main and auxiliary is unified. We have grasped the objective laws of the movement of things. We have also gained a useful experience: in industrial production, we must not only grasp the production of main engines and main parts greatly, but also grasp the production of auxiliary engines and accessories greatly. In this way, our mechanical products can exert their effectiveness in a timely and full manner.

　　主和辅
　　陈之衍
    主，主要的意思；辅，辅助的意思。显而易见，主比辅重要。主是统帅，辅是为主服务的。但是，我们观察问题，思考问题，切不可把事物之间的关系，看成是固定的、僵化的、一成不变的。比如，主和辅，在一般情况下，主是决定性的。没有主导的方面，谈不到什么辅助方面。但是，在另外一些情况下，辅也可能变为决定性的，没有辅，主就没有用武之地。
    这并不是什么抽象的关系问题，而是实际生活中常常碰到的问题。比如，在我们的工业生产中，如何正确对待主和辅，就是一个很重要的问题。
    发电设备、轧钢设备，都有主机、辅机之分；汽车、拖拉机和其它农业机具的构成，也都有主件和配件、附件之别。任何一套发电设备，主机辅机必须配成套，才能发出电力；任何一辆汽车，也必须有必要的配件、附件，供装配和维修之用。在这里，主和辅是相互依存的，谁也离开不了谁。在一般情况下，主机主件是矛盾的主要方面，可是从眼前来看，辅机、配件却成为一个主要的问题。道理何在？主机、主件，机体、件头比较大，产值也高，是设备和机具的主体，就像一棵大树的主干一样，容易引起人们的重视。因此，常常安排一些主要的工厂，在一个工厂里也是安排主要的车间来生产主机、主件。在原材料、技术力量上也常常得到优先的供应。这些做法都是正确的，我们做任何事情，都要抓主要的方面。但是，这并不等于次要的、辅助的方面就不重要。问题恰好就发生在这里。前一个时期，有的企业，因为辅机、配件、附件，件头小、规格多，既费工，产值又低，因而对辅机、配件的生产，不像生产主机、主件那样积极，那样重视。结果，影响了一些设备的配套，也影响了一些汽车、拖拉机和其它农业机具的维修。在这种情况下，矛盾转化了，辅机、配件成为突出的问题了，成为企业领导者需要大抓、特抓、具体抓的问题了。
    我们有一条经验，任何问题，只要我们采取具体措施，认真去抓，可以这样说，问题就一定能够解决。令我们十分高兴的是，抓辅机、配件的生产，已经被许许多多地方重视起来了，已经在大抓特抓了，而且已经取得了很好的效果。请读读今天本报发表的报道：北至哈尔滨、南至广州、西至玉门、东到上海，在支援农业和全国一盘棋的思想指导下，大大发扬了共产主义风格，大批大批的辅机、配件制造出来了，结果是大批的设备、机台迅速配套出厂了，待修的汽车、拖拉机大大减少了。
    主和辅的矛盾统一了。事物运动的客观规律被我们掌握了。我们又得到了一条有益的经验：在工业生产中，既要大抓主机主件的生产，又要大抓辅机、配件的生产。这样就能使我们的机械产品及时地、充分地发挥效能。
