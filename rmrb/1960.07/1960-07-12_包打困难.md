Guarantee to Overcome Difficulties
　　Lin Xu

The July issue of "People's Literature" has a striking title: "The Guarantee to Overcome Difficulties Shock Brigade." The article tells the story of a veteran worker leading three apprentices to help backward units overcome difficulties. As soon as they heard that a small workshop was encountering production difficulties, they stepped forward to vigorously support it, shouting, "We'll guarantee to overcome the difficulties of the small workshop." The story is very moving, and there is no need to repeat it here. I just want to comment on the spirit of "guaranteeing to overcome difficulties."

In our actual lives, we can see heroes who dare to guarantee to overcome difficulties everywhere. Recently, under the guidance of the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation," cadres in many places have generally improved their leadership style and working methods in order to strengthen their leadership over agricultural production, going deep into the grassroots and the forefront of production. They all have a common wish: to go wherever there are difficulties, and to go wherever the difficulties are greatest! Some places have implemented a "contract system" to "contract" a commune, a production team, or an aspect of work. Not only that, but they also stated that they would not return until the task was completed, and would not return until the difficulties were overcome, and that they would turn the backward into the advanced, and make the advanced even more advanced. In a word, the tasks assigned to these comrades by the Party are all contracted; no matter how great the difficulties ahead, they are also contracted.

Guaranteeing to overcome difficulties is a revolutionary heroic spirit. Those comrades who go to the forefront of production are willing to adopt a "contract" attitude towards the tasks assigned by the Party because they are not afraid of difficulties. They have the courage to despise difficulties, and they also have the determination and confidence to overcome difficulties. Revolutionaries can be said to have the clearest understanding of the temperament of the opponent "difficulty." We have come to the conclusion from revolutionary practice that difficulties are also paper tigers. The question is whether you have the courage to poke it. As long as we dare to despise difficulties, we will be able to overcome difficulties. A tenacious revolutionary will and a fearless heroic spirit are like a paper tiger encountering fire when it comes to difficulties. Therefore, the greatest force in overcoming difficulties is not something else, but the firm revolutionary belief and tenacious fighting spirit of the revolutionaries. The vast number of grassroots cadres have set off to the forefront of production, they do not care about conditions, they do not bargain, and no matter how arduous the tasks ahead, they hold their heads high and catch up. Their bodies are precisely the manifestation of the revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties.

Those heroes who guarantee to overcome difficulties are not indifferent to every specific difficulty. When they do their work, they are down-to-earth, pragmatic, and realistic, doing what they say, and never talking empty words. They strategically despise difficulties and treat them as paper tigers to fight; tactically, they value difficulties and treat them as real tigers to fight. They make specific analyses of specific difficulties and find effective measures to overcome them. They have both courage and methods.

The revolutionary act of guaranteeing to overcome difficulties is even more valuable in the word "guarantee." When a task is in front of them and a responsibility is on their shoulders, no matter how many difficulties there are, or how great the difficulties are, they take on everything and guarantee everything. This is also a reflection of a high degree of responsibility to the revolutionary cause, and it is a communist style of selflessness and public service. People often say, "Leave the difficulties to yourself and give the convenience to others," which is also the spirit of guaranteeing to overcome all difficulties. They do not complain, do not shout difficulties, and do not act as伸手派 [those who stretch out their hands to ask for help], but instead work hard and diligently, relying on their own efforts to make contributions to the Party and the people.

Of course, guaranteeing to overcome difficulties does not mean relying solely on the strength of a few people to guarantee the world. On the contrary, to guarantee to overcome difficulties, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses and rely on the strength of the broad masses to overcome difficulties. The reason why those comrades who go to the forefront dare to pat their chests, in addition to their own fearless courage and high sense of responsibility, is that they believe in the power of the masses, are determined to go deep into the masses, rely on the masses, and bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. With more people and greater strength, and with broad wisdom, they can guarantee to overcome and break through even the greatest difficulties. What is there to fear when a dragon enters the sea?

    包打困难
　　林旭
    7月号的《人民文学》上，有一个引人注目的题目：《包打困难突击队》。文章写的是一个老师傅带领三个徒弟，帮助落后单位克服困难的故事。他们一听说小工房的生产遇到了困难，就挺身而出，大力支援，喊着：“小工房的困难咱包了。”故事写得很动人，这里不必赘述。我只想对于“包打困难”的精神发一点议论。
    在我们的实际生活中，处处都可以看到这种敢于包打困难的英雄。最近一个时期，在“以农业为基础”的思想指导下，许多地方的干部为着加强对农业生产的领导，普遍地改进领导作风和工作方法，深入到基层、深入到生产第一线。他们都有一个共同的愿望：哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里困难大就到哪里去！有些地方实行了“包干制”，要把一个公社、一个生产队或者一个方面的工作“包下来”。这还不算，他们还表示不完成任务不回来，不战胜困难不回来，定要把落后的变为先进，先进的变得更加先进。一句话，党交给这些同志的任务，他们全包下了；面前有多大困难，他们也包下了。
    包打困难，这是一种革命的英雄气概，那些走向生产第一线的同志们，勇于对党分配的任务采取“包下来”的态度，就是因为他们不害怕困难。他们有着藐视困难的勇气，也有着战胜困难的决心和信心。对于“困难”这个对手的脾气，革命者可以说是摸得最清楚了。我们从革命的实践中得出这样的结论：困难也是纸老虎。问题就在于有没有胆量去戳它。只要我们敢于藐视困难，就一定能够战胜困难。顽强的革命意志和大无畏的英雄气概，对于困难来说，就像是纸老虎遇上火。因此，战胜困难的最大的力量，不是别的，正是革命者那种坚定不移的革命信念和顽强的斗争精神。广大的基层干部出发到生产第一线去了，他们不计条件，不讲价钱，不管面前的任务多么艰巨，却昂首挺胸，迎头赶上。在他们的身上正是表现了革命者不怕困难的英雄精神。
    那些包打困难的英雄们，对待每一个具体困难并不是满不在乎的，他们做起工作来却是扎扎实实、脚踏实地、实事求是，说到哪里做到哪里，从来不讲一句空话。他们在战略上藐视困难，把它当作纸老虎去打；在战术上又重视困难，把它当作真老虎去打。对具体困难作具体分析，找出克服困难的有效措施。在他们身上，既有勇气，也有办法。
    包打困难的革命行为之所以可贵，更在那个“包”字上面。任务当前，责任在身，不管困难有多少，也不管困难有多么大，他们一身承担，全都包下来了。这又是一种对革命事业高度负责精神的反映，是舍己为人，大公无私的共产主义风格。人们常说：“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”，也就是这种包打一切困难的精神。他们不叫苦，不喊难，不当伸手派，而是任劳任怨，埋头苦干，依靠自己的努力，为党为人民作出贡献。
    当然，包打困难并不是说只依靠少数人的力量包打天下。恰恰相反，要包打困难，只有发动广大的群众，依靠广大群众的力量去战胜困难。那些走上第一线的同志们之所以敢于拍胸脯，除了自己有着无畏的勇气和高度的责任感以外，就是由于他们相信群众的力量，下决心深入群众，依靠群众，把广大群众的积极性和创造性发挥起来。人多势众力量大，智慧广，天大的困难他们都能包得下，攻得破。蛟龙入大海，还有什么可怕的呢？
