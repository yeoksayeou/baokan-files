Xinhua News Agency, 6th. After Sunarjo, the head of the Central Intelligence Department of the Indonesian Army, and Nawawi Alif, the press officer of the West Java Military Region Command, made lies to cover up the truth and attempt to deny responsibility for the bloody massacre in Tjimas where two overseas Chinese women were shot by the West Java military authorities, some Indonesian bourgeois newspapers, as if directed by a magic wand, published these lies on the front page in prominent positions on the 5th, and deliberately used many headlines that distorted the facts and reversed black and white. They unanimously accused the overseas Chinese of "provocation" and planning to "seize weapons," attempting to deceive the people, shift the blame, and continue to incite anti-Chinese sentiment.

    "Indonesia Raya" used the following headline in a prominent position on the front page: "Overseas Chinese Provocation Aggravates Indonesian-Chinese Relations," "Using Women to Achieve Certain Goals"; "Their actions are extremely irresponsible."

      "Kompas" also falsely accused "Overseas Chinese women being used as a means to achieve certain goals" and "Overseas Chinese attempting to seize soldiers' weapons" in its headline.

      "Suluh Indonesia" incited in its headline: "Overseas Chinese Attack the State Apparatus." "Provocation aimed at damaging Indonesian-Chinese relations." "Merdeka" also reversed right and wrong in a particularly prominent headline on the front page, saying: "Overseas Chinese in Tjimas Attack the State Apparatus with Stones, Wood, and Bottles."

      The headline of "Indonesian News" falsely accused: "Overseas Chinese Provocation Aggravates Indonesian-Chinese Relations," "The Tjimas Weapon Seizure Incident is Extremely Irresponsible."

    印度尼西亚右翼报纸颠倒黑白
    妄图掩盖芝马圩惨案事实真相
    新华社6日讯　在印度尼西亚陆军中央情报部负责人苏纳约和西爪哇军区司令部新闻官纳瓦维·阿利夫就西爪哇军事当局枪杀芝马圩两名华侨妇女的流血惨案发表了掩盖事实真相、妄图抵赖罪责的谎言以后，印度尼西亚一些资产阶级报纸像受到一根魔棒的指挥一样，都在5日以首页显要地位刊载了这些谎言，并且别有用心地使用了许多歪曲事实、颠倒黑白的标题。它们一致地反诬华侨“挑衅”和打算“夺取武器”，企图欺骗人民，转移罪责，并继续煽动排华情绪。
    “印度尼西亚群岛报”在首页显著地位所用的标题是：“华侨的挑衅恶化印度尼西亚和中国的关系，”“利用妇女来达到某种目的”；“他们的行动是极不负责的。”
      “指南针报”在标题中也诬蔑“华侨妇女被利用作为实现某种目的的手段”和“华侨企图夺取军人的武器”。
      “印度尼西亚火炬报”在标题中煽动说：“华侨攻击国家机器”。“挑衅以搞坏印度尼西亚和中国的关系为目的。”“独立报”也在首页特别显著地位的标题中颠倒是非地说：“芝马圩的华侨以石头、木头和瓶子攻击国家机器”。
      “印度尼西亚新闻”的标题诬蔑说：“华侨的挑衅恶化印度尼西亚和中国的关系”，“芝马圩夺取武器事件是非常不负责任的”。
