Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. Premier Zhou Enlai wrote a letter to Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala on July 12th regarding the accidental incident that occurred on the Sino-Nepalese border on June 28th. In his letter, Premier Zhou first expressed his pleasure in seeing that this unfortunate incident had been handled swiftly and appropriately due to the friendly and understanding attitude adopted by both sides, and that those who were trying every possible means to find opportunities to undermine the friendship between China and Nepal had not been able to achieve their sinister goals. Premier Zhou said that the Chinese government had notified the Nepalese government in advance on June 26th regarding the Chinese troops' suppression of Tibetan bandits in our area close to the Sino-Nepalese border. In the notification, the Chinese government specifically emphasized that Chinese troops would never cross the border to pursue the bandits, and that as soon as the task of suppressing the bandits was completed, the Chinese troops would immediately withdraw from the area 20 kilometers from our side of the border. This fully demonstrates that the Chinese government respects the agreement on the border issue and values Sino-Nepalese friendship. After the accidental incident on the Sino-Nepalese border on June 28th, in order to avoid causing misunderstandings again, the Chinese government has ordered Chinese troops not to suppress Tibetan bandits within 10 kilometers of our side of the border. According to current estimates, the work of suppressing the bandits can be completed by the end of July, at which time the Chinese troops will all withdraw from the area 20 kilometers from our side of the border. Premier Zhou said that he was pleased to note that Prime Minister Koirala had assured in his letter of July 7th that the Tibetan armed bandits who had entered Nepalese territory had been and would be dealt with in accordance with international law. Premier Zhou expressed his belief that with the elimination of Tibetan bandits on the Sino-Nepalese border, the tranquility of the border between the two countries will be ensured, and the agreement between the two countries on the border issue will be smoothly implemented. Premier Zhou accepted Nepal's request for compensation of 50,000 rupees for the losses suffered in the incident, and said that it would be remitted to the Nepalese government in the near future.
    
On July 18th, Pan Zili, our country's ambassador to India and Nepal, wrote to Thapa, the Foreign Secretary of the Nepalese government, regarding the compensation, and attached 50,000 Indian rupees with the letter.

    中尼边境意外事件得到迅速妥善处理
    周总理写信给柯伊拉腊首相
    由于双方采取了友好和谅解态度使破坏中尼友谊的人们没有达到目的
    剿匪工作月底可结束届时中国部队将全部撤出边界本侧二十公里地区
    新华社20日讯　关于6月28日在中尼边境发生的意外事件，周恩来总理在7月12日写信给尼泊尔柯伊拉腊首相。在信中，周总理首先表示高兴地看到，这次不幸的事件，由于双方采取了友好和谅解的态度，已经得到迅速的和妥善的处理，而那些千方百计地寻找机会企图破坏中尼两国友谊的人们，并没有能够达到他们的阴险的目的。周总理说，关于中国部队在靠近中尼边界的我方地区进剿西藏叛匪一事，中国政府曾经事先在6月26日通知了尼泊尔政府。在通知中，中国政府特别强调中国部队决不越界追击叛匪，一俟剿匪任务结束，中国部队将立即撤离边界本侧二十公里的地区。这充分说明，中国政府对边界问题的协定是尊重的，对中尼友好是重视的。6月28日中尼边境意外事件发生后，为了避免再次引起误会，中国政府并已经命令中国部队不在边界本侧十公里的地区内进剿西藏叛匪。根据目前估计，剿匪工作可以在7月底结束，届时中国部队将全部撤出边界本侧二十公里的地区。周总理说，他高兴地注意到柯伊拉腊首相在7月7日来信中保证，对进入尼泊尔境内的西藏武装叛匪已经而且将来也要按国际法加以处理。周总理表示相信，随着中尼边境西藏叛匪的肃清，两国边境的安宁将能确保，两国关于边界问题的协定将能顺利地实施。周总理接受尼泊尔方面就这次事件所受的损失提出五万卢比赔偿的要求，表示将在最近期间汇交尼泊尔政府。
    7月18日我国驻印度兼驻尼泊尔大使潘自力就赔偿事写信给尼泊尔政府外事秘书塔帕，随信附去五万印度卢比。
