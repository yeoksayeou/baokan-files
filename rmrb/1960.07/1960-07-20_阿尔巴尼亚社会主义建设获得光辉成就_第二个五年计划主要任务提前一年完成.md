Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 17th: Albanian State Planning Commission Vice Chairman Dode stated in an article published in "People's Voice" on the 16th that Albania has already fulfilled the industrial production targets and agricultural collectivization tasks set by the Third Congress of the Labor Party for the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) one year ahead of schedule. He also said that Albania's current industrial output value for half a month is equal to the total industrial output value for the entire year of 1938 before liberation. As of last year, the total agricultural output value had increased by about 100% compared to 1938.

Dode's article elaborated on the enormous achievements Albania has made so far in implementing the Second Five-Year Plan.

He pointed out that by the end of this year, Albania's industrial output value is expected to increase by 115% compared to 1955. In these five years, industrial production has grown at an average annual rate of 16.6%, while the original plan was to grow at 14% per year. This high rate of industrial development has never been seen in capitalist countries or in Albania's neighboring countries such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia. Albania used to be the most backward country compared to its neighbors, but now, in terms of per capita output of minerals such as coal, oil, chromium, and copper, it has surpassed countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey.

When talking about achievements in agriculture, Dode pointed out that state farms and cooperatives currently account for 85.2% of the country's cultivated land area. Agricultural collectivization has been fully realized in the plains areas.

Dode said that the capital construction tasks for the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan were overfulfilled by 29%, and it is expected that the Second Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled by 16% by the end of this year.

Dode also said that as of 1959, Albania's industrial labor productivity had increased by 42.8% compared to the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, national income had increased by 43%, and the real wages of workers and staff had increased by 29%.

    阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设获得光辉成就  第二个五年计划主要任务提前一年完成
    五年内工业生产每年平均增长16.6％，目前每半个月的产值等于解放前全年产值；煤、石油、铬、铜等按人口平均产量，已超过意大利；社会主义农业已占全国耕地85.2％
    新华社地拉那17日电　阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会副主席多德16日在“人民之声报”发表文章指出，阿尔巴尼亚已经提前一年实现了劳动党第三次代表大会为第二个五年计划
  （1956—1960年）所规定的工业生产指标和农业合作化的任务。他又说，目前阿尔巴尼亚每半个月的工业产值就等于解放前1938年全年的工业生产总值。截至去年为止，农业总产值比1938年增加一倍左右。
    多德的这篇文章论述了截至目前为止阿尔巴尼亚在执行第二个五年计划方面所已取得的巨大成就。
    他指出，预计到今年年底，阿尔巴尼亚工业产值将比1955年增加115％。在这五年中，工业生产每年平均增长16.6％，而原订计划是每年增长14％。这种工业发展的高速度在资本主义国家，在阿尔巴尼亚的邻国希腊、意大利、南斯拉夫都是从来未曾有过的。阿尔巴尼亚过去同邻国相比是最落后的国家，而现在，它在煤、石油、铬、铜等矿产按人口平均计算的产量方面已超过了意大利、希腊、土耳其等国。
    多德在谈到农业方面的成就时指出，目前，国营农场和合作社的耕地已占全国耕地面积的85.2％。平原地区已全部实现了农业合作化。
    多德说，第二个五年计划头四年的基本建设任务超额29％完成计划，预计到今年结束时将要超额16％完成第二个五年计划。
    多德又说，截至1959年为止，阿尔巴尼亚工业劳动生产率比第二个五年计划开始时提高了42.8％，国民收入提高了43％，职工实际工资提高了29％。
