I Want to Accuse the Whole World

Lin Bingwang, a student of the Senior 3 Class of Fuqing No. 1 Middle School, Fujian Province

I want to accuse the Indonesian powerful clique of directing the West Java army to kill my mother, Ye Jinniang, in a bloody atrocity. The murderers used machine guns to strafe my mother. She was shot seven times and lay on the ground calling for help, but they didn't allow anyone to rescue her.

Just over two months ago, I received a letter from my mother saying that because her small stall had been forced to close, and her seven younger siblings overseas were mostly out of school due to financial difficulties, she was preparing to lead her family back to China. After reading the letter, I was both indignant at the Indonesian powerful clique's anti-Chinese activities and very happy to be reunited with my family soon. I had been hoping they could come back soon, but I never expected that the Indonesian powerful clique would direct the West Java army to snatch away the life of my dear mother with their evil black hands. Nine years ago, I parted with my mother, and it became our eternal farewell.

My parents lived in Bogor, Lembang, Cimaung and other places for a total of twenty or thirty years, and always got along well with the local people. My father grew vegetables, potatoes and other crops to supply the local market's needs; in addition to helping my father grow vegetables, my mother diligently ran a stall selling cotton and knitwear, often providing many conveniences to the Indonesian people. My mother also often helped her Indonesian neighbors mend clothes, so she became their good neighbor. However, the Indonesian powerful clique directed the West Java army to kill my mother. I demand that the Indonesian government immediately punish the murderers and take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. (Attached picture)

    我要向全世界控诉
    福建省福清第一中学高三班学生　林秉望
    我要向全世界控诉印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队杀死我母亲叶金娘的血腥暴行。杀人犯用机枪扫射我的母亲，她身中七弹，卧地呼救，他们还不准别人去抢救。
    就在两个多月以前，我接到母亲来信说，由于她经营的小摊贩被迫停业了，在海外的七个弟妹由于生活所迫，多半失学了，因此，准备带领一家人回国。我看见信后，一方面对印度尼西亚有势力集团的排华活动感到愤慨，一方面又对不久后，能和自己的亲人团聚，感到非常高兴。我一直盼望着他们能够早日回来，但是万万想不到，印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队竟用罪恶的黑手夺去了我亲爱的母亲的生命。九年前，我和母亲分别，竟成永诀。
    我父母侨居茂物、连旺、芝马圩等地一共二、三十年，和当地人民一直友好相处。父亲种植蔬菜、马铃薯等农作物，供应当地市场需要；母亲除了帮助父亲种植蔬菜外，并辛勤经营着一个棉布和针织品的商摊，经常给印度尼西亚人民许多方便。我的母亲还常常帮助印度尼西亚的邻居缝补衣服，因此，她成为他们的好邻居。然而，印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队竟杀害了我的母亲。我要求印度尼西亚政府立即惩办杀人凶犯，并采取有效措施，保证今后不再发生类似事件。（附图片）
