Ma'anshan Iron and Steel: Regularly Maintains Ore Reserves of Three Days or More

Daye Steel Plant: Grasps Production with One Hand and Raw Material Supply with the Other

Taiyuan Iron and Steel: Hundred-Member Inspection Team Conducts In-Depth Inspections of Raw Material Storage and Transportation

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 30th) Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company is earnestly grasping measures to prepare for a comprehensive leap forward in various productions in the third quarter.

The third quarter production targets for Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company will increase by a larger margin than the first and second quarters. Pig iron will increase by about 20% compared to the second quarter, while steel and steel products will increase more than twofold. In order to seize the opportunity and take the initiative, the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee convened a four-level cadre meeting in early June to fully discuss this year's production increase and frugality plan, especially the various production preparations for the next quarter. Subsequently, the leaders of various factories and mines went deep into the blast furnaces and construction sites, working with the masses to study the key points and weak links of production and formulate specific improvement plans. In terms of tapping the potential of existing equipment, the various iron-smelting plants actively increased the air volume and raised the air temperature based on the operational policy of taking air as the key and raw materials as the foundation.

In order to ensure a sufficient supply of ore to the blast furnaces, the various iron mines under the company continue to vigorously promote ore crushing and storage, the use of chutes for loading, automatic opening and sliding for unloading, and the use of cranes for loading and unloading ships. They also adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to process ore locally, introduce finished products into the factory, and use indigenous methods for ore dressing to increase the iron content of the ore entering the furnace. The transportation department will organize 45 Red Flag direct trains to ensure that about 70% of the raw materials are transported directly to the furnaces. They have also made corresponding adjustments to the internal transportation lines of the plant, renovating five elevated lines, so that not only can each railway line reach the steel-smelting, iron-smelting, coking plants and mines, but also accelerate the unloading speed. Now, they have prepared sufficient "food" for the blast furnaces, and qualified ore can be regularly maintained at a reserve of three to four days.

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 30th) Daye Steel Plant has achieved great success in vigorously grasping the production preparation work for the third quarter.

In order to organize a new upsurge in production, the Daye Steel Plant Party Committee held two consecutive Party Committee meetings in mid-June, believing that to achieve a greater increase in production in the third quarter, it is necessary to make full preparations in the following aspects: improving the supply of raw materials; vigorously promoting new technologies and new experiences; and overcoming the heat and high temperatures. To do this work well, the factory Party Committee decided that the First Secretary of the Party Committee and the Director of the factory would personally take charge, launching a mass movement for production preparation work. In grasping production preparation, Daye Steel Plant first adopted a combination of striving for external assistance and relying on self-reliance based on the new production level in the second half of the year, and vigorously grasped the supply of raw materials. On the one hand, they established a special organization to strengthen contact with working groups stationed in other places to ensure the timely transfer of raw materials; on the other hand, they vigorously developed diversified operations and comprehensive utilization to increase production and conserve raw materials. At present, the entire plant has built a raw material production base including two 100-cubic-meter blast furnaces, six simple coking furnaces, a small mine, and dozens of earthen iron-smelting furnaces and earthen sintering furnaces. In addition, they have also established satellite factories such as dolomite plants, lime plants, and refractory material plants, among which several major raw materials have achieved partial or complete self-sufficiency.

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th) Taking advantage of the excellent production situation, the employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company vigorously grasped the supply of ore and coal raw materials and actively carried out equipment maintenance, making full preparations for the continued leap forward in steel production in July and the third quarter.

Since the second half of June, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has organized a hundred-member inspection team to go to the steel-smelting, iron-smelting, and steel-rolling systems to conduct in-depth and detailed inspections of the transfer and storage of raw materials. Problems discovered during the inspection were resolved in a timely manner. As a result, the amount of ore entering the plant in the second half of the month increased by 80% compared with the first half of the month, and the average iron content of the ore also increased from 46% to 48% in the past; the supply of raw coal was also basically implemented. Currently, the storage volume of raw coal and ore has increased by more than 30,000 tons compared with the beginning of June. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to further expose the current problems in production, achieving immediate results in rectification and improvement. Employees of the Second Steel Rolling Plant posted more than 2,700 big-character posters in the past week to help the leaders find the key problems in the current production and put forward suggestions for improvement. Based on the reasonable suggestions of the employees, the factory Party Committee, led by the Party Secretary, organized 13 leading cadres to go deep into the front line and conduct research and improvement together with the workers, adopting a total of 452 suggestions and handling them in a timely manner.

    赶运矿石煤炭　力争粮草充足
    马钢：经常保持三天以上的矿石储备
    冶钢：一手抓生产一手抓原材料供应
    太钢：百人检查团深入检查原材料储运
    本报合肥30日电　马鞍山钢铁公司切切实实大抓措施，为第三季度各项生产全面跃进作好准备。
    马鞍山钢铁公司第三季度各项生产指标比一、二季度增长的幅度更大，生铁将比二季度增长20％左右，钢和钢材都将猛增一倍以上。为了抓紧时机，争取主动，马鞍山市委在6月上旬召开了四级干部大
  会，充分讨论了今年的增产节约计划，特别是下季度的各项生产准备工作。接着，各厂、矿领导都深入高炉、工地和群众一道，研究生产关键和薄弱环节，订出具体改进方案。在挖掘现有设备潜力方面，各炼铁厂根据以风为纲，以原料为基础的操作方针，积极加大风量，提高风温。
    为了保证供给高炉足够矿石，这个公司所属各个铁矿，继续大搞矿山破碎贮矿化、装车滑坡溜槽化、卸车自动开门滑坡化、装船卸船车子吊杆化。并采取土洋结合办法，实行矿石就地加工，成品入厂，土法选矿，提高入炉矿石的含铁量。交通运输部门将组织四十五条红旗直达列车，保证70％左右的原料由红旗直达列车运往炉前。他们还对厂内运输线路作了相应调整，改造了五条高线路，不但使每条铁路都能通到炼钢、炼铁、炼焦厂和矿山，而且加速了卸车速度。现在，他们已为高炉准备了充足“食粮”，合格矿石能经常保持到三天至四天的储备量。
    本报武汉30日电　大冶钢厂狠抓第三季度的生产准备工作，获得很大成绩。
    为了组织新的生产高潮，大冶钢厂党委在6月中旬连续召开两次党委会议，认为要实现三季度生产更大幅度的增长，必须在以下几个方面做好充分准备，即：搞好原材料供应；大力推广新技术，新经验和战胜炎暑高温。为了做好这些工作，工厂党委确定由党委第一书记和厂长亲自负责，掀起一个生产准备工作的群众运动。大冶钢厂在抓生产准备中，首先根据下半年新的生产水平，采取力争外援和自力更生相结合的办法，狠抓原材料供应。他们一方面成立专门机构加强与驻外地工作组的联系，保证原材料的及时调运；另一方面，大搞多种经营和综合利用增产节约原材料。目前全厂已建起了一个包括有两座一百立方米的高炉、六座简易炼焦炉、一座小型矿山和几十座土化铁炉、土烧结炉的原材料生产基地；另外还办起了白云石厂、石灰厂、耐火材料厂等各种卫星厂，其中有几种主要原材料已作到部分自给和全部自给。
    本报太原30日电　太原钢铁公司职工趁生产大好形势，狠抓矿石、煤炭原料供应，积极进行设备检修，为7月份和三季度钢铁生产持续跃进做了充分准备。
    6月下半月以来，太原钢铁公司组织了百人检查团，分赴炼钢、炼铁、轧钢三大系统对原材料的调运和储备进行了深入细致的检查。检查中对发现的问题都及时进行了解决。因而使下半月的矿石进厂量比上半月增长了80％，矿石的含铁量平均也由过去的46％提高到48％；原煤供应也基本落实。现在，原煤和矿石的储存量比6月初增加了三万多吨。同时发动群众进一步揭发了当前生产中的问题，做到了边整边改，在生产中立见功效。第二轧钢厂职工在最近一周内贴出了两千七百多张大字报，帮助领导找出了当前生产中的关键问题，并提出了改进意见。工厂党委根据职工的合理建议，以党委书记为首，组织了十三个领导干部深入现场，和工人群众一起进行研究改进，先后共采纳了四百五十二条建议，及时进行了处理。
