Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 22nd: The workers in Shenyang City's machinery system, closely focusing on the weak links in the current production, are carrying out mass movements in the forms of "Breakthrough the Key" and "Breaking Through Barriers Competition", pushing the technical innovation and technological revolution movement to a new climax.

In order to ensure the continued leap forward in production in the second half of the year, for more than a month, the machinery factories in Shenyang City have been focusing on the key to production and further carrying out technical innovation and technological revolution movements. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant carried out the "Find Problems, Breakthrough the Key" movement, with everyone working together, from materials entering the factory to products leaving the factory, accounting for and checking the key at each link, and determining measures.

Various machinery manufacturing factories, due to their concentrated efforts, using new technologies and new experiences as weapons, launched an offensive against the key to production, promoting further development of production. After entering July, the Shenyang China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Factory, aiming at the weak link of casting production not keeping up with processing needs, organized all the technical personnel of the factory's departments to spend half a day every day going deep into the casting workshop, working with the workers, and jointly studying and improving casting technology. The Party Committee Secretary, Han Zhishun, went to the workshop and first grasped the biggest key of the whole factory—the quality problem of the headstock, organized old workers, technicians and workshop cadres to hold technical seminars, organized experience promotion teams to help the workers of the headstock team improve their operations, and adopted advanced technical experience, so that the quality of the headstock was quickly improved. In early July, the qualification rate of the factory's castings had increased from 82.7% in the past to 98.14%, providing more and better castings for the processing workshop.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 22nd: The workers on the industrial, transportation, and capital construction fronts in Tianjin are launching a large-scale mass movement to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and create advanced indicators, striving to achieve first place in output, first place in quality, first place in the trial production and putting into production of high-precision and cutting-edge products, first place in reducing raw material consumption, and first place in safety and hygiene.

Through large-scale debates with the content of "Dare to compete for first place, can you compete for first place, how to compete for first place", the workers of each factory further liberated their thinking, established lofty ambitions, and successively selected advanced indicators and advanced experiences from this city and other places, as the objects of learning, catching up with, surpassing, and creating, based on the specific conditions of their factory, workshop, group, and individual, and formulated specific plans and measures to strive for the five firsts at all levels. Up to now, 137 factories in Hebei District alone have formulated specific plans.

In the movement to strive for the five firsts, leading cadres of industrial bureaus, professional companies, and factory enterprises in the city have gone deep into the front line of production to participate in and lead the movement. After the workers of Tianjin Bicycle Factory found out that the key to the low quality of the Flying Pigeon brand bicycle flywheel and the smoothness of the electroplating and paint surface was not as good as the Forever brand, they immediately convened a workers' representative meeting, handed the key to the worker masses, and launched a large-scale technological revolution among the workers. Aiming at the quality problem of the rough electroplating and grinding of the rims, the workers of the rim workshop, on the one hand, put the new equipment realized in the previous stage of the technological revolution movement into production, consolidated and improved it; on the other hand, they adopted innovative measures to improve the technological operation, and quickly broke through the key, and the quality of all electroplated parts reached and exceeded the national standards.

    沈阳市机械系统用新经验作武器进攻薄弱环节
    天津广大职工力争产量更高质量更好用料更省
    据新华社沈阳22日电　沈阳市机械工业职工紧密围绕当前生产的薄弱环节，开展“突关键”、“破关赛”等形式的群众运动，把技术革新和技术革命运动推向了新高潮。
    为了保证下半年生产的继续跃进，沈阳市各机械工厂最近一个多月以来，紧紧围绕生产关键，进一步开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。沈阳第一机床厂职工在党委领导下，开展了“找问题、突关键”运动，上下一齐动手，从材料入厂到产品出厂，在每个环节上都人人算账查关键，定措施。
    各个机械制造工厂由于集中力量，以新技术和新经验作武器，向生产关键展开进攻，促进了生产进一步发展。沈阳市中捷友谊厂跨进7月后，针对铸造生产赶不上加工需要的薄弱环节，组织全厂科室技术人员每天抽出半天时间深入铸工车间，和工人们一起劳动，共同研究改进铸造技术。党委书记韩志顺下到车间，首先抓住了全厂最大关键——主轴箱的质量问题，组织老工人、技术人员和车间干部开技术座谈会，组织经验推广队，帮助主轴箱小组工人改进操作，采用先进技术经验，使主轴箱的质量很快提高。7月上旬，这个厂的铸件合格率已由过去的82.7％提高到98.14％，给加工车间提供了更多更好的铸件。
    据新华社天津22日电　天津市工业、交通、基本建设战线职工，掀起大规模学、赶、超、创先进指标的群众运动，力争实现产量第一、质量第一、试制和投入生产的高精尖产品第一、降低原材料消耗第一、安全卫生第一。
    各厂职工通过以“敢不敢争第一，能不能争第一，怎样争第一”等为内容的大辩论，进一步解放了思想，树立了雄心大志，纷纷根据本厂、车间、小组和个人的具体条件，选择本市和外地的先进指标，先进经验，作为学、赶、超、创的对象，层层订出力争五个第一的具体规划和措施。到目前为止，仅河北区就有一百三十七个工厂订出了具体规划。
    在力争五个第一的运动中，全市各工业局、专业公司和工厂企业的领导干部，纷纷深入生产第一线参加运动、领导运动。天津自行车厂职工找出飞鸽牌自行车飞轮质量低、电镀和油漆表面滑度不如永久牌的关键以后，立刻召开了职工代表大会，把关键交给职工群众，发动职工大搞技术革命。车圈工段工人针对车圈电镀研磨粗的质量问题，一方面把前一阶段技术革命运动中实现的新设备投入生产，加以巩固提高；另一方面采取改进工艺操作的革新措施很快就突破了关键，电镀部件的质量全部达到和超过了国家标准。
