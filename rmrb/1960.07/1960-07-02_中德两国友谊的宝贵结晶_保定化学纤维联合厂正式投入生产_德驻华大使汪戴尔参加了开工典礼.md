Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 1st: China's first modern large-scale chemical fiber joint factory was officially put into production in Baoding today. More than two thousand workers held a grand inauguration ceremony. The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dair, was invited to attend the inauguration ceremony.

The Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory officially started construction in the spring of 1958. The entire project was built in two phases. The first phase, which has now been completed, mainly produces viscose rayon filament, exclusively for the textile industry for weaving silk. This phase of the project was originally scheduled to be fully put into production by the end of this year. Thanks to the workers' conscientious implementation of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and their engagement in wave after wave of technological innovation and technological revolution movements, the first system of this phase was put into production on "July 1st" last year, a year ahead of schedule. Subsequently, the second, third, and fourth systems of this phase also began trial production before April of this year, creating favorable conditions for the overall handover to production. Currently, the factory's production capacity has reached its designed level, and the quality of rayon has reached or approached international standards. In the exhibition hall next to the inauguration ceremony venue today, various fabrics as thin as cicada wings like georgette, beautiful and elegant printed silk, shimmering brocade satin, dazzling velvet, as well as silk undershirts, silk vests, socks, scarves, bed sheets, etc., all made with rayon produced by this factory, were on display.

In the process of building the factory, the German Democratic Republic provided comprehensive assistance. The German Democratic Republic provided China with a complete set of designs and equipment, trained a large number of skilled workers, and successively dispatched more than fifty experts to China to assist in factory construction and trial production.

At today's inauguration ceremony, after the factory director, Ling Wu, reported on the construction process, representatives of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial People's Committee, and the State Acceptance Committee, as well as the Vice Governor of Hebei Province, Duan Yi, spoke at the meeting. He expressed his heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to all the workers who built the factory and all the German experts who helped with the construction and extended a warm welcome to Ambassador Wang Dair. Duan Yi said: The completion of the first phase of the chemical fiber factory is a precious crystallization of the friendship between China and Germany. Its commissioning has created a good beginning for the development of China's chemical fiber industry.

Minister of Textile Industry Jiang Guangnai also attended today's meeting and spoke. He pointed out that the commissioning of the first phase of the Baoding Chemical Fiber Factory is of great significance for the continued leap forward of the textile industry in the future. He said: The development of the chemical fiber industry can not only increase the quantity and variety of textiles to meet the needs of the people's ever-improving lives but also change the past situation of importing rayon from abroad every year.

Ambassador Wang Dair was invited to speak at the meeting. He said: The construction of the Baoding Chemical Fiber Factory marks the fraternal internationalist cooperation and mutual assistance of socialist countries and is a new monument to Sino-German friendship. He said: Every factory we build together is to strengthen the strength of our respective countries and improve the lives of our people, and at the same time, it is a blow to our common enemy, American imperialism.

Also attending the inauguration ceremony and speaking at the meeting today were Vice Minister of Chemical Industry Li Su, Secretary of the Baoding Municipal Party Committee and Mayor Li Peixian, Head of the German Expert Group Wei Erkai, Head of the Expert Team Hai Mu'er, and worker representatives.

    中德两国友谊的宝贵结晶
    保定化学纤维联合厂正式投入生产
    德驻华大使汪戴尔参加了开工典礼
    新华社保定1日电　我国第一座现代化大型化学纤维联合工厂今天在保定正式投入生产。两千多名职工举行了隆重的开工生产典礼大会。德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔应邀参加了开工典礼。
    保定化学纤维联合厂是在1958年春正式动工兴建的，全部工程分两期建设。现在建成的是第一期工程，主要生产粘胶长纤维人造丝，专供纺织工业织造丝绸用。这期工程原计划在今年年底全部投入生产。由于职工们认真贯彻了土洋结合，边建设边生产的方针，掀起了一浪高一浪的技术革新和技术革命运动，终于使这期工程的第一系统在去年“七一”就投入生产，比原计划提前一年。接着这期工程的第二、三、四系统也在今年4月以前先后开始试生产，为全部移交生产创造了良好条件。现在这个厂的生产能力已经达到设计水平，人造丝的质量也已经达到或接近国际标准。今天在举行开工典礼会场旁的展览室里陈列着各种薄如蝉翼的乔其纱，美丽大方的印花绸，金光闪闪的织锦缎，鲜艳夺目的丝绒以及丝汗衫、丝背心、袜子、头巾、被面等等，都是用这个厂生产的人造丝制造的。
    这个厂在建厂过程中，得到德意志民主共和国的全面帮助。德意志民主共和国为我国提供了全套设计和设备，培养了大批技术工人，同时还先后派遣了五十多位专家前来我国帮助建厂和试生产。
    在今天的开工典礼大会上，这个厂的厂长令吾报告了建厂经过以后，中共河北省委、省人民委员会和国家验收委员会的代表、河北省副省长段毅在会上讲了话。他向建设这个工厂的全体职工和帮助建设的全体德国专家表示衷心的祝贺和谢意，并向汪戴尔大使表示热烈欢迎。段毅说：化学纤维厂第一期工程的建成是中德两国友谊的宝贵结晶。它的投入生产，为我国发展化学纤维工业创造了良好的开端。
    纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐也出席了今天的大会并讲话。他指出：保定化学纤维厂第一期工程的投入生产，对今后纺织工业的持续跃进有着重大意义。他说：化学纤维工业的发展不但可以增加纺织品的数量和花色品种，以适应人民生活日益改善的需要，还可以改变过去每年需要从国外进口人造丝的状况。
    汪戴尔大使应邀在会上讲了话。他说：保定化学纤维厂的建设，标志着社会主义国家兄弟般的国际主义合作和互助，也是中德友谊的新的纪念碑。他说：我们共同建设的每一个工厂都是为了加强我们各国的力量和改善我们各国人民的生活，同时也是给我们共同敌人——美帝国主义的打击。
    今天参加开工典礼并在会上讲话的还有化学工业部副部长李苏、中共保定市委书记处书记兼市长李佩先、德国专家总组长魏尔凯、专家组长海姆尔以及职工代表等。
