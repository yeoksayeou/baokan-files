Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 23rd: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, citing materials from the "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs" of the Heo Jeong Group, labor-management disputes in South Korea, in which workers fight for survival and democratic rights, have swept through seventy-five industrial enterprises by July 20th.

	This indicates that the number of enterprises experiencing labor-management disputes has increased by forty-two since June 15th.

	The main demands of the workers in these enterprises are to increase wages, pay back wages, improve treatment, and sign collective contracts. For example, workers at "Heunghwa Manufacturing Factory" in Busan, "Daeyang Shipping Company" in Incheon, "Buksam Chemical Company" in Samcheok, and some other factories and enterprises are engaged in tenacious struggles to demand wage increases and the conclusion of collective contracts.

	According to South Korean newspaper reports, workers are also widely holding marches, demonstrations, and strikes.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, citing newspapers in Seoul, the South Korean ruling group dispatched more than 21,000 puppet police officers throughout South Korea again on the night of July 20th to the early morning of the 21st, and arrested another 5,492 innocent people.

	This is the second large-scale arrest conducted by the puppet ruling group on the eve of the "election." On the night of the 12th to the early morning of the 14th, the Heo Jeong Group had already arrested 5,186 people.

	The report said that such repeated mass arrests demonstrate that the South Korean ruling group, with the Heo Jeong Group at its core, can only rely on terror and suppression to "guarantee" "victory" in the upcoming "election."

    争取生存和民主权利
    南朝鲜工人纷纷起来斗争
    许政集团在伪选前夕出动警察大肆逮捕无辜人民
    新华社平壤23日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，南朝鲜同和通讯社援引许政集团“保健社会部”的材料，到7月20日为止，南朝鲜工人争取生存和民主权利的劳资纠纷已席卷七十五个工业企业。
    这表明，从6月15日以来，发生劳资纠纷的企业就增加了四十二个。
    这些企业中的工人的主要要求是增加工资、支付欠薪、改善待遇和订立集体合同。例如釜山的“兴化制造厂”、仁川的“大杨轮船公司”、三陟的“北三化学公司”和一些其他工厂和企业的工人正在进行顽强的斗争，要求增加工资和缔结集体合同。
    据南朝鲜报纸消息，工人们还广泛地举行游行示威和罢工。
    新华社平壤22日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社引用汉城报纸消息报道，南朝鲜统治集团7月20日晚间到21日清晨又在南朝鲜各地出动了两万一千多名伪警察，再次逮捕了五千四百九十二名无辜人民。
    这是伪统治集团在“选举”前夕进行的第二次大逮捕。在12日晚间到14日清晨，许政集团已经逮捕了五千一百八十六人。
    消息说，这样一再大批捕人的作法表明，以许政集团为核心的南朝鲜统治集团仅仅能够依靠恐怖镇压来“保证”在即将举行的“选举”中“获胜”。
