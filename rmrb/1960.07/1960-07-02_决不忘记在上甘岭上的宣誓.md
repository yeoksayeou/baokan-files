    Never Forget the Oath Taken on Shangganling
    PLA Soldier Huang Jishu
    As the tenth anniversary of the American imperialists' launching of the war of aggression against Korea arrives, seeing "Plague God" Eisenhower fanning the flames everywhere in the Far East, I cannot restrain the anger in my heart. I must write a few words to warn these defeated generals at the hands of the Volunteer Army!
    In the spring of 1958, when our first batch of Volunteer Army soldiers were about to withdraw from Korea, the leaders, my comrades and I went to Shangganling to bid farewell to the heroic positions, and to bid farewell to my heroic brother Huang Jiguang. At that time, I made the following oath:
    "My heroic brother: You gloriously shed your youthful blood on the Korean soil for the sake of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes, and defending our country; the price of your lives and the lives of your comrades have exchanged for the happiness of the Korean people in rebuilding their homeland today. Mother has repeatedly encouraged me in her letters to study hard to learn the skills to kill the enemy, and to inherit the legacy of Brother Jiguang. I will never forget it. Now, in order to strive for peace and reunification in Korea, and in order to resolutely implement the instructions from superiors to unilaterally withdraw troops, we must bid farewell to the heroic positions, and also bid farewell to our heroic brother, and also reluctantly bid farewell to the heroic Korean soil!
    "Brother Jiguang: Although our Volunteer Army has returned to our country, our hearts are forever linked with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, as close as flesh and blood; this is not only because we, the Chinese and Korean people, have a deep friendship forged in fighting side by side, but also because our common enemy is American imperialism! If the enemy dares to launch another war of aggression against Korea, our Volunteer Army will definitely return to the front line and give the enemy a devastating blow again! To avenge the sacrificed martyrs! To avenge our sacrificed brother!"
    These vows that I left in my diary, when I reread them today, remind me clearly of the scene when I bid farewell to my brother at Shangganling that day:
    That was a day when the accumulated snow had just melted. We brought wreaths and fruits for the memorial service. An old Korean man even helped me dig up a half-person-high green pine tree to bring up the mountain together. When I first set foot on the world-famous Shangganling with the feeling of commemorating the martyrs, I was very excited. A leader pointed to a place and told me: This is where your brother sacrificed himself by blocking the gun muzzle with his body. At this time, we offered wreaths and libations at the place where my brother sacrificed himself. Afterwards, I planted a Korean green pine tree for my brother. I raised my pickaxe and dug less than a foot deep, and dug out two long machine gun bullets with red tips from the frozen soil. These two bullets were bullets that the American devils transported from the Pacific to massacre the people. They had long been buried underground by the floating soil bombarded at that time, and after eight years, they were dug out again; these two bullets have now been sent to our country's revolutionary history museum.
    I am now studying in a school of the People's Liberation Army. The image of my brother has given me the courage and determination to overcome various difficulties in my studies. But, these days, Eisenhower, the mad dog, is biting people everywhere, and their running dog Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary clique even personally killed the Japanese patriotic student Michiko Kamba, which fills me with righteous indignation. If the warmongers dare to replay the history of the past today and impose the flames of war on the heads of the people, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army led by our Party will surely eliminate this mad dog. I will also never forget the solemn oath I took on Shangganling, and I will definitely advance along the bloody footsteps of the martyrs!

    决不忘记在上甘岭上的宣誓
    解放军战士　黄继恕
    在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争十周年的时候，我看到“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到远东到处煽风点火，我怎么也抑制不住心头的怒火，非要写下几句话来警告这些志愿军手下的败将不可！
    1958年的春天，当我们志愿军第一批要撤出朝鲜的时候，我和首长与其他战友们一起到上甘岭去向英雄的阵地告别，去向我英雄的哥哥黄继光告别。当时，我作过这样的宣誓：
    “我的英雄的哥哥：你为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，把青春的热血光荣地洒在朝鲜的国土上；你和你的战友们所付出的生命代价，换取了朝鲜人民今天重建家园的幸福。妈妈几次来信勉励我，要我好好学习杀敌本领，继承继光哥的遗志。我一定不会忘记。现在，我们为了争取朝鲜的和平与统一，为了坚决执行上级提出单方面撤军的指示，我们要和英雄的阵地告别，也和英雄的哥哥告别，也留恋地和英雄的朝鲜国土告别！
    “继光哥：虽然我们志愿军归国了，但是我们与朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军永远心连心，骨肉相亲；这不仅因为我们中朝人民有着并肩作战的深厚友谊，而且因为我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义！假如敌人一旦敢于再次发动侵朝战争，我们志愿军一定重返前线，再给敌人以毁灭性的打击！为牺牲的烈士报仇！为牺牲的哥哥报仇！”
    我留在日记本上的这些誓词，至今重读起来，又使我清楚地记起那天我在上甘岭和哥哥告别的情景：
    那是一个积雪刚刚融化的一天。我们带着祭奠的花圈和果品，一位朝鲜老大爷还特地帮我挖了一棵半人高的青松，一同带上山去。当我第一次带着怀念烈士的感情，登上举世闻名的上甘岭时，我的心情十分激动。一位首长指着一个地方告诉我：这就是你哥哥用身体堵住枪眼牺牲的地方。这时，我们在哥哥牺牲的地方，献了花圈和奠酒。随后，我就为哥哥栽了一棵朝鲜的青松。我举起镐头刨了不到一尺深，在冻土里挖出了两颗长长的带红头的重机枪子弹。这两颗子弹是美国鬼子从太平洋运过来的残杀人民的子弹，它早已被当时炮轰的浮土埋在地下，经过八年之久，又被挖了出来；这两颗子弹，现在已经送进了我国的革命历史博物馆了。
    我现在在解放军的一个学校学习。我哥哥的形象给了我在学习中克服各种困难的勇气和决心。但是，这些日子，艾森豪威尔疯狗到处咬人，他们的走狗岸信介反动集团还亲手杀死了日本的爱国学生桦美智子，使我义愤填胸。假如战争贩子们今天胆敢重演过去的历史，把战火强加于人民的头上，我们党所领导的人民解放军战士一定会把这疯狗消灭掉。我也决不忘记在上甘岭上的庄严宣誓，一定踏着烈士的血迹前进！
