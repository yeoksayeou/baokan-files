　　“Model Worker-Peasant” - Zhang Shun
　　By our reporter

    The inspiring story of Zhang Shun, a "Model Worker-Peasant," is widely circulated in the Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune in Changxindian, a suburb of Beijing. Zhang Shun was originally a veteran blacksmith at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. After retiring in 1954, he devoted himself to the agricultural production movement. For six years, he has been repairing farm tools, building machines, and imparting technology to the commune members, earning their love and praise.

    Zhang Shun participated in the "February 7th" strike. In the factory, he earned the glorious title of labor model for his outstanding completion of production tasks. After retirement, he was wholeheartedly concerned about the cause of socialist construction and could not get used to a leisurely and comfortable retirement life. Several times, as soon as he heard the factory whistle, he would pick up his lunchbox and run to the factory; at night, he would often return to the factory in his dreams to work at the forge. With such a red heart devoted to building socialism, Zhang Shun was soon attracted to the bustling agricultural production movement in the village. Seeing his farmer brothers working hard to increase production, he felt that as an old worker, it was his glorious responsibility to support agricultural production, and he must contribute his strength and sweat!

    One freezing day in 1956, the members of the "Red May" Agricultural Cooperative were digging wells and opening canals. Zhang Shun passed by and saw that the hoes in the hands of the members were all worn down. A thought immediately came to his mind: "I'm not good at anything else, but I'm an expert at blacksmithing. Why can't I repair farm tools for the members and take on a few apprentices?" He immediately turned around and walked to the cooperative office.

    The cooperative party committee warmly welcomed him and immediately assigned him two promising young men. Zhang Shun took his apprentices to a small temple, where they built a furnace and a stove from scratch and started a small iron factory. The dilapidated temple, which had not seen incense for many years, became lively again, with the furnace burning brightly from morning till night. In one year, they repaired more than 30 kinds of farm tools and made more than 4,000 hoes and small picks from scrap iron, powerfully supporting agricultural production. The commune members happily said: This time, our dilapidated temple has produced a "living god"! This old blacksmith is always ready to help and really solves problems!

    In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the rural production movement was surging, and a large amount of labor was needed everywhere. Seeing this situation, Zhang Shun began to ponder again: "It seems that to continuously improve agricultural production, hard work alone is not enough. We must reform farm tools. It would be great if the commune members could use machines to farm the land." At that time, the cooperative planted hundreds of acres of sweet potatoes, and he decided to experiment with making a sweet potato digging machine first. He pondered hard for two days and drew a sketch of a horse-drawn sweet potato digging machine. He discussed it with the production team leader and decided to make one to try first. The first experiment failed. With the support of the cooperative party committee, he consulted with the commune members to revise it. Finally, the sweet potato digging machine was made in time, allowing the cooperative to harvest hundreds of acres of sweet potatoes five days ahead of schedule. Then, he successively researched and developed peanut and corn two-way seeders, weeding machines, and also helped carpenters create a close-planting wheat seeder. In this way, Zhang Shun supported agricultural production and agricultural technical transformation for the Party, the people, and socialist construction without any compensation. The commune members respected and loved this old worker. In 1958, he was named a municipal agricultural labor model.

    The giant wave of the people's commune movement swept across the country. The "Red May" Agricultural Production Cooperative merged with several nearby cooperatives to establish the Changxindian Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune. After the establishment of the commune, it quickly established an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant. Zhang Shun, with great excitement, took his small iron factory team to the repair and manufacturing plant. The newly built agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant's forging workshop did not have a single skilled worker. Zhang Shun came here and taught them one by one by hand. His eldest apprentice, Chen Baohe, also became a backbone force here. The leading cadres and workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory were very concerned about Zhang Shun's work in the commune. When the commune's agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant encountered difficulties in production that Zhang Shun could not solve, he would go to the vehicle factory and tell them, and the factory would immediately extend a helping hand.

    In the past year, the agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant where Zhang Shun is located has developed rapidly, with all kinds of jobs in the car, fitter, forging, casting, and welding trades. With the active help of Zhang Shun and the workers from large factories near the commune, the technical strength of the factory has also grown rapidly, and all trades have workers who have initially mastered the technology and are able to operate independently. Zhang Shun also cooperated with two other old workers in the factory to install a trip hammer in the forging workshop. Now, this factory not only undertakes the medium and small repairs of motorized farm tools and agricultural machinery within the commune, but also manufactures farm tools, belt conveyors, car trailers, and other products in batches.

    Over the past few years, the old worker Zhang Shun has regarded the needs of his farmer brothers as his own needs and the affairs of his farmer brothers as his own affairs, and he has become more and more enthusiastic. His wife sometimes said to him with concern, seeing him running around all day, "I don't know where you get your energy at such an old age. You can never stay idle!" He replied, "The Party and Chairman Mao gave me this spirit. If I don't work now, I won't be able to catch up if I want to work tomorrow!" The commune party committee and the cadres of the repair and manufacturing plant also advised him: "Pay more attention to rest. Let the young people do more, and you can just give them pointers from the side." Zhang Shun shook his fist disapprovingly and said, "I still want to work until communism!"

　　“工农双模范”——张顺
　　本报记者
    北京郊区长辛店中捷友好人民公社里，到处传颂着“工农双模范”张顺的动人事迹。张顺原来是长辛店机车车辆工厂的老锻工。1954年退休以后，投身农业大生产运动。为社员修农具，造机器，传授技术，六年如一日，受到农民的热爱和称赞。
    张顺参加过“二七”大罢工。在工厂里，由于他出色地完成生产任务，获得了劳动模范的光荣称号。退休以后，他一心惦着社会主义建设事业，怎么也过不惯清闲安逸的退休生活。好几次一听见工厂的汽笛响，他就提起饭盒往工厂跑；夜间，时常在梦中回到工厂去打铁。有着这样一颗建设社会主义红心的张顺，不久就被村里热火朝天的农业大生产运动吸引住了。他眼瞅着农民兄弟闹增产，感到自己是个老工人，支援农业生产是自己光荣的责任，一定要出把力气，流把汗！
    1956年的一个天寒地冻的日子，“红五月”农业合作社的社员们正在打井、开渠。张顺从旁边路过，看到社员们手里的镐头都用秃了，心里顿时产生了一个念头：“我别的不行，论打铁可不外行，为什么不能给社员修修农具，再带上几个徒弟？”他立刻转身向社办公室走去。
    社党委热情地欢迎他，马上给他派了两个好样的小伙子。张顺带上徒弟，在一座小庙里搪炉、垒灶，白手起家办起了小小的铁工厂。多年不见香火的破庙，从此又热闹起来，从早到晚，炉火旺盛。一年的工夫，经他们手修好的农具、用废铁打的锄头、小镐等，有三十多种，四千多件，有力地支援了农业生产。社员们高兴地说：这回咱这座破庙可出了“活神仙”了，这个老铁匠有求必应，真解决问题啊！
    大跃进的1958年，农村生产运动波浪滔天，到处需要大量劳动力。看到这种情况，张顺又琢磨开了：“看样子，要不断提高农业生产，光靠苦干还不够，非改革农具不行；要是能让社员们种地都使上机器，那可就好了。”当时，社里种了几百亩白薯，他决心先试验着搞一台刨白薯的机器。他苦心琢磨了两天，画出了一台马拉刨薯机的草图，跟生产队长进行了研究，决定先打一台试试。第一次试验失败了。在社党委的支持下，他找社员们一块儿商量修改。最后终于及时制成了刨白薯机，使社里几百亩白薯提前五天收完。接着，他又先后研究成功了花生、玉米、两用播种机、锄草机，还帮助木工创造了密植小麦播种机。张顺就这样为党、为人民、为社会主义建设，不要任何代价地支援农业生产和农业技术改造。社员们人人尊敬和爱戴这个老工人，1958年，他被评为全市农业劳动模范。
    人民公社运动的巨浪席卷全国，“红五月”农业生产合作社同附近几个社合并，建立了长辛店中捷友好人民公社。公社成立以后，很快就办起了农业机械修造厂，张顺怀着极其兴奋的心情，带着小铁工厂的人马来到修造厂。新建的农机修造厂锻工车间没有一个技术工人，张顺来到这里，就手把手一个一个地教。他的大徒弟陈宝和，也成了这里的骨干力量。长辛店机车车辆工厂的领导干部和工人们，都非常关心张顺在社里的工作。公社农机修造厂在生产中遇到困难，张顺解决不了的到车辆厂去一说，工厂立刻伸出支援的手。
    一年来，张顺所在的农机修造厂发展得很快，车、钳、锻、铸、焊各个工种样样俱全。在张顺和公社附近大工厂工人的积极帮助下，厂里的技术力量也增长得很快，各个工种都有了初步掌握技术、能够独立操作的工人。张顺还同厂里其他两位老工人合作，给锻工车间装制了一台夹板锤。现在，这个厂不仅担负了公社内部机动农具和农业机器的中修、小修，而且成批制造农具、皮带运输机、汽车拖车等。
    几年以来，老工人张顺把农民兄弟的需要当作自己的需要，把农民兄弟的事情，当作自己的事情，越干越带劲。他的老伴看他整天跑里跑外的，有时关心地说：“这么大年纪，不知哪儿来的精神，总是闲不住！”他回答说：“党和毛主席给我的精神，这会儿不干，明儿再想干都赶不上啦！”公社党委和修造厂的干部也劝他：“多注意休息。让年轻人多干点，你从旁指点指点就行了。”张顺不以为然地把大拳头一伸说：“我还要干到共产主义呢？”
