    Plague God
    Following the Rhyme Scheme of Chairman Mao's Poem
    Chen Shutong
	Bases scattered like stars, much war preparation,
	The people despise you, but what can be done?
	一心弄巧输秦赂 [Yīxīn nòng qiǎo shū qín lù] (1), trying so hard to bribe the Qin,
	八面围攻起楚歌 [Bā miàn wéigōng qǐ chǔ gē] (2), surrounded on all sides, the songs of Chu arise.
	Visits exhausting, only hitting walls,
	Eloquent arguments for peace, still a suspended river.
	In the ranks of struggle, such as I,
	Going against the enemy, should emulate Ma Yuan.
	Charter of aggression has long articles,
	Slandering me is truly like a dog barking at Yao.
	Long-range bombing becomes a program,
	Helicopters prepared as ladders. (2)
	Heart trembling, courage failing, finally fleeing,
	With popular support gone, already wavering.
	Knowing your death date is approaching,
	The raging fire in the back garden is burning high.

(Note 1) Zuo Zhuan says that when Ping Zheng went on a mission to Qin, he bribed them.
(Note 2) When Eisenhower was in South Korea, there was always a helicopter hanging above him with a two hundred-foot-long ladder, ready for rescue at any time.

    瘟神
    谨借次　毛主席诗韵
    陈叔通基地星罗战备多，人民厌恶奈之何？一心弄巧输秦赂（一），八面围攻起楚歌。访问身劳徒碰壁，和平口辩尚悬河。斗争行列中如我，赴敌应师马伏波。宪章侵略有长条，诬我真同犬吠尧。远径炮轰成节目，直升机备作梯桥。（二）心惊胆落终逃窜，众叛亲离已动摇。知汝死期行且至，后园烈火正高烧。（注一）左传平郑使于秦且谢贿赂。（注二）艾森豪威尔在南朝鲜时，头上一直有一架直升飞机挂着
    二百英尺长吊梯，以备随时搭救。
