Thorough and Meticulous

    On July 16th, after reading the readers' letters published in the People's Daily letters column regarding the hotelization of dormitories, I felt that the hotelization of dormitories is indeed not a small matter. It is a revolutionary measure and a vivid demonstration of our Party's thorough and meticulous care for the lives of workers. Its significance far exceeds the scope of "life." Thanks to the Party's concern and the new arrangement of life, single workers can use the time they previously spent on dormitory chores to learn technology and culture. No wonder the workers are moved to say, "We must work harder in production and use outstanding production achievements to answer the Party's concern." This is the role played after the hotelization of dormitories.

    "Do you want to get the support of the masses? Do you want the masses to put all their strength on the front line? Then you must be with the masses, you must mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, you must care about the pain and itching of the masses, you must sincerely seek the interests of the masses, and solve the production and life problems of the masses, the salt problem, the rice problem, the house problem, the clothing problem, the problem of having children, and solve all the problems of the masses. If we do this, the broad masses will definitely support us, regard the revolution as their life, and regard the revolution as their supreme and glorious banner." ("Concern for the life of the masses, pay attention to work methods") At present, people are working diligently for the great cause of socialist construction, working hard, disregarding compensation, and constantly developing the communist spirit and revolutionary style. In order to keep the masses forever full of energy and vigor, and to make production surge forward wave after wave, it is so important to draw experience and inspiration from the example of dormitory hotelization and, at the same time, review Chairman Mao's words!

    无微不至
    中共吉林市委财贸部　张弘引
    七月十六日，我在读了人民日报来信栏里发表的关于宿舍旅馆化的几篇读者来信后，感到宿舍旅馆化实在不是一件小事情。它是革命的措施，是我们党对职工生活无微不至的关怀的又一次鲜明的表现。它的意义远远超越了“生活”的范围，由于党的关怀，由于生活的新安排，独身职工们可以把过去忙于宿舍琐事的时间，用来学技术、学文化，无怪工人们都感动地说：“我们一定要在生产上再加把劲，用优异的生产成绩来回答党的关怀。”这就是宿舍旅馆化以后所产生的作用。
    “要得到群众的拥护吗？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去吗？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。我们是这样做了么，广大群众就必定拥护我们，把革命当作他们的生命，把革命当作他们无上光荣的旗帜。”（“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”）目前，人们正在兢兢业业地为伟大的社会主义建设事业而辛勤劳动，他们不计报酬，不断地发扬着共产主义精神和革命的风格。为使群众永远保持充沛的精力和旺盛的干劲，使生产一浪高一浪地向前发展，从宿舍旅馆化这一事例中吸取经验和启示，同时重温一下毛主席的话，该是多么重要啊！
