Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Reports from Delhi indicate that as the Indian government employees' strike enters its third day, workers across the country held a one-day national sympathy strike, further expanding the strike's momentum.

The national sympathy strike on July 14th was launched by three national trade union organizations in India to support the government employees' struggle for higher wages.

According to the Press Trust of India, all dockworkers in Mumbai participated in the sympathy strike. The 8,000 dockworkers on the night shift on the 13th went on strike before the scheduled strike time of 6:00 AM on the 14th. None of the 10,000 dockworkers who were supposed to take over came to work. Employees of the Mumbai Municipal Transport Corporation's buses and trams also stopped work early on the night of the 13th.

In Calcutta, bus and tram workers responded to the sympathy strike and did not operate today. Shops and businesses were closed, and markets were also shut down.

In Madras, 3,000 industrial workers in some factories near the city also participated in the sympathy strike. According to the Press Information Bureau of India, 2,000 workers at the Madras Coach Factory walked out of the factory on the 13th to support the government employees' strike.

On the 13th, the government employees' strike continued to expand across India. The "Hindustan Standard" said today that despite official claims of "general improvement" in maintaining essential services, "there are clear signs that the situation worsened on the 13th."

Agence France-Presse reported that in Delhi, despite official announcements that postal services in the capital were "proceeding as usual," postal deliveries have been suspended since the morning of the 12th.

The Press Information Bureau of India reported that within Indian defense establishments, 17 institutions were affected by the strike as of the evening of the 13th.

"The Times of India" reported that in Mumbai, despite the police arresting 155 people on the 13th and using "batons five times," "the number of people coming to the central government offices was almost as small as on the first day of the strike." In the evening, the situation in northern Mumbai was tense, and people held two demonstrations almost simultaneously, defying orders prohibiting public gatherings. According to the Press Trust of India, most employees of the Mumbai Post and Telegraph Office left their posts. Telecommunications between the city and the rest of the country continued to be cut off on the 13th. Other reports said that the strike disrupted radio communications between Mumbai and New Delhi on the 13th, and the Mumbai-New Delhi telex lines used by news agencies and newspapers were shut down. Postal services were paralyzed. Strikers and demonstrators in Mumbai lay on the tracks to prevent trains from running. According to a report in the "Hindustan Times" on the 13th, attendance at approximately 200 small central government-owned enterprises in Mumbai was only 10% to 15%.

Reuters reported that the strike in Calcutta was becoming increasingly serious. At Howrah Station, which normally handles 278 trains per day, only four trains passed through on the 13th.

In eastern India, on the 12th, crowds demonstrated at the Burdwan station in West Bengal. Police fired on the demonstrators, dispersed them, and imposed a 24-hour curfew in Burdwan. On the same day in Asansol, police used tin batons to disperse demonstrators gathered at the locomotive workshops to prevent locomotives from leaving. Approximately 100 telephone exchanges there were also shut down due to a lack of personnel. "The Times of India" reported that workers at the Charbagh Locomotive Factory in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, continued their sit-down strike on the 13th. In Kanpur, more than 200 postal workers and counter staff went on strike completely because the authorities did not allow the workers at the General Post Office to pass a resolution condemning the police firing in Dohad. According to the Press Information Bureau of India, western railway centers such as Ahmedabad and Bardar were affected by the strike. Freight trains have been suspended in some sections of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad section. On the Southern Railway, some sections of the Adra district and the Purulia-Chandil section "encountered trouble." "The Statesman" reported that "at Dohad, the location of two police shootings on July 12, the number of workers who reported to the railway workshop (on the 13th) was only 13%." The newspaper said that demonstrations occurred there again, but the police suppressed them with tear gas and tin batons. According to the Press Trust of India, "Approximately 800 workers of the Secunderabad Municipal Corporation, near Hyderabad city, continued their indefinite strike on the 13th, protesting the arrest of their leaders."

As workers' strikes in India expanded, the Indian government's repression of strikers became increasingly intensified. As previously reported, police in Dohad, Gujarat, shot and killed seven people. On the 13th, in addition to the police shootings in various locations mentioned above, the number of arrests reached an alarming scale. According to official figures released by the Press Information Bureau of India on the 14th, the Indian government has arrested more than 4,000 people across the country so far, including more than 1,300 in the north, 1,700 in the south, more than 900 in the west, and 128 in Orissa alone in the east. Reuters reported on the 13th that in Jaipur, Rajasthan, 13 people had already been sentenced by a judge to one year in prison and fined 500 rupees each on charges of "inciting government employees to strike."

Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: New Delhi reports: The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 13th, condemning the police shooting of striking workers in Dohad, stating that "this is the inevitable result of the policy being implemented by the Indian government." The statement said that Prime Minister Nehru was trying to portray the government employees' strike as an attempt to provoke the civil authorities "in order to justify the severe repressive measures it has already taken." The statement pointed out that the government announced a decree banning strikes within hours of Prime Minister Nehru's broadcast, "which clearly shows that the government relies mainly on the coercive apparatus."

"Within 24 hours of the start of the strike, more than 2,000 leaders and workers had been arrested; intimidation and threats were used on the widest scale; the government's propaganda machine – radio and newspapers – was used to distort the demands of government employees and suppress accurate news about the strike, in an attempt to frustrate the spirit of government employees." The statement said, "If the government thinks it can win in this way, it will make a big mistake. The lasting resentment these measures leave among government employees is something no government can take lightly." The statement demanded that the Indian government "abandon the above measures, release those arrested, and engage in frank and direct negotiations with the Joint Action Committee."

　　政府雇员罢工规模继续扩大  很多地区铁路邮电工作陷于瘫痪
　　印共谴责政府镇压措施  官方公布全国被捕人数已达四千多人
　　新华社14日讯　来自德里的消息表明，当今天印度政府雇员罢工进入第三天的时候，各地工人举行了为时一天的全国性同情罢工，使罢工声势更加扩大。
    7月14日全国同情罢工，是在印度的三个全国性工会组织发起下为支援政府雇员为争取提高工资的斗争而举行的。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，孟买的码头工人全部参加了同情罢工。13日值夜班的八千码头工人，没有等到规定的14日早晨六点钟的罢工时间，就提前罢了工。接班的一万名码头工人也都没有来上班。孟买市营交通公司的公共汽车和电车职工也在13日夜里提前收车。
    在加尔各答，公共汽车工人和电车工人响应了同情罢工，今天都没有出车。商店和商行关了门，市场也关闭了。
    在马德拉斯，靠近城市的一些工厂中的三千产业工人也参加了同情罢工。据印度新闻处消息，马德拉斯车厢制造工厂的二千名工人13日走出了工厂，支持政府雇员的罢工。
    13日这天，印度各地政府雇员罢工在继续扩大。“印度斯坦旗报”今天说，尽管官方说在维持重要的服务行业方面有了“普遍的改善”，“但是有明显的迹象表明，13日的情况恶化了”。
    法新社说，在德里，尽管官方的公报说，首都的邮政工作“照常进行”，但是从12日上午以来，德里的邮政投递工作已经停止了。
    印度新闻处报道说，在印度国防机构中，到13日晚上为止，有十七个机构受到了罢工影响。
      “印度时报”说，在孟买，13日这天，尽管警察逮捕了一百五十五人，并且“五次使用警棍”，“到中央政府办公室办公的人几乎和罢工第一天一样少。晚上，在孟买北面，局势紧张，人们不顾关于禁止公共集会的命令几乎同时举行了两场示威。据印度报业托辣斯报道，孟买邮局和电报局大部分职工都离开了岗位。13日这个城市同全国各地的电讯联络继续断绝。另外的消息说，13日这天，罢工使孟买和新德里之间的无线电通讯中断，通讯社和报纸所用的孟买—新德里的电传线路已经停开。邮政工作已经处于瘫痪状态。孟买的罢工者和示威者躺在铁轨上阻止火车开行。据“印度斯坦时报”13日报道，在孟买，大约有二百个中央政府所属的小型企业中，出勤都只有10％到15％。
    路透社说，加尔各答的罢工愈来愈严重。在豪拉车站一般每天要通过二百七十八次列车，13日只通过了四列。
    在印度东部，12日群众在西孟加拉的布德万车站举行示威。警察向示威者开枪，驱散了示威者，并且在布德万下令实行二十四小时的戒严。同一天在阿散索尔，警察用铁皮警棍驱散了聚集在机车间阻止机车开出的示威者。那里大约有一百台电话交换机也由于缺少人手而关掉。“印度时报”说，在北方邦勒克瑙的查巴格机车工厂的工人们13日继续进行静坐罢工。在坎普尔，由于当局不许邮政总局的工人通过决议谴责警察在多哈德开枪镇压事件，那里的两百多名邮递员和柜台人员完全罢了工。据印度新闻处消息，阿麦达巴、巴尔达等西部铁路中心受到罢工影响。在孟买—阿麦达巴段一些地方的货车已经停开。在南部铁路，阿德拉县的几段和普鲁利亚—昌迪尔段“发生了麻烦”。“政治家报”说，在“7月12日发生两起警察开枪事件的地点多哈德，（13日）铁路工场出工的人数只有13％”。这家报纸说，那里又发生了示威，但是警察用催泪弹和铁皮警棍进行镇压。据印度报业托辣斯报道，“靠近海得拉巴城的锡康达腊巴德市营公司的大约八百名工人，13日继续进行无限期的罢工，抗议逮捕他们的领袖”。在印度工人罢工日益扩大的同时，印度政府对罢工者的镇压也日益变本加厉。前已报道，在古吉拉特的多哈德警察开枪打死了七人。13日，除了上述各地警察开枪镇压事件外，逮捕已达到惊人的规模。据官方的印度新闻处14日公布的数字，印度政府至今在全国各地已经逮捕了四千多人，其中北部逮捕了一千三百多人，南部一千七百人，西部九百多人，东部仅奥里萨邦一个地方就逮捕了一百二十八人。路透社13日报道说，在拉贾斯坦邦的斋浦尔，已经有十三人被法官以“煽动政府雇员罢工”的罪名判处一年徒刑，各罚款五百卢比。
    据新华社14日讯　新德里消息：印度共产党全国委员会书记处13日发表声明，谴责警察在多哈德开枪射击罢工工人的事件，指出“这是印度政府所执行的政策必然产生的结果”。声明说，尼赫鲁总理力图把这次政府雇员罢工描绘为对民政当局挑衅的企图，“以便为它已经采取的严厉镇压的措施寻找根据”。声明指出，政府在尼赫鲁总理广播后的几小时内公布了禁止罢工的法令，“这清楚表明，政府主要倚靠强制机器”。
  “在罢工开始后的二十四小时内，已有两千多领导人和工人被捕；在最广泛的范围内采取了恐吓和威胁的手段；政府的宣传机器——电台和报刊——被利用来歪曲政府雇员的要求和压制有关罢工的正确消息，企图挫折政府雇员的锐气”。声明说，“如果政府认为它这样就可以获胜，那它将犯很大的错误。这些措施给政府雇员们留下的持久的不满情绪，是任何政府都不能等闲视之的。”声明要求印度政府“放弃采取上述措
  施，释放被捕者，同联合行动委员会进行坦率的直接谈判”。
