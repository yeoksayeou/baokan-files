Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: William Irvine, head of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation delegation visiting China, told our reporter on the 26th, before the delegation left Beijing for Shanghai, that the Chinese people's hands are busy engaging in construction beneficial to mankind. He refuted the slander by imperialists that China is bellicose, saying, "China needs peace."

Irvine, a seventy-year-old member of the National Council of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, also said, "China's rights are being violated. China will rise to defend itself against aggression, but it will not launch wars of aggression."

He also pointed out, "We believe China will never allow militarists or imperialists to trample on it again."

Irvine criticized the United States' position on Taiwan as "absurd." He said, "Many Western leaders are angry at the United States' insistence on its foolish actions regarding Taiwan."

Mrs. Peterson and Stevens, the other two members of the visiting delegation who were present, also expressed their agreement with these views.

When talking about developing friendly relations between Canada and China, delegation leader William Irvine believed that Canada should first recognize New China, thereby eliminating the foolish obstacles that should not exist between the two countries. He advocated that the two countries should establish trade relations and strengthen friendly exchanges between people.

When talking about his impressions of his visit to China over the past ten days, William Irvine said that our delegation was very pleased and educated by its visit to China. "We are amazed and deeply impressed by the tremendous progress made by New China in a short period of time.

He said, we saw the happy lives of the Chinese people and their enthusiasm for construction. "This is a great encouragement to us."

William Irvine said that he had visited China's iron and steel industry and small-scale industries. He believed that in a short period of time, the Chinese people will be able to well meet their economic needs.

William Irvine also praised China's People's Communes. He said that the People's Communes seemed particularly suitable for China's situation. "We believe that the People's Communes have made significant achievements in agriculture, and without the People's Communes, these achievements would be difficult to obtain." William Irvine was also particularly interested in China's policy of combining education with productive labor. He said that in the Western world, the privileged class considers labor an insult to them, and therefore looks down on working people. But in the new Chinese education system, labor is respected.

    威廉·欧文驳斥帝国主义者污蔑中国好战的谰言
    中国人民忙于建设需要和平
    美国在台湾的立场是荒唐的　中国的权利正遭到侵犯
    中国短期内进展巨大　人民公社使农业获得重大成就
    新华社27日讯　加拿大平民合作联盟人士访华团团长威廉·欧文26日在该团离开北京去上海前对本社记者说，中国人民的双手正忙于从事于有益于人类的建设事业。他驳斥帝国主义者污蔑中国好战的谰言说，“中国需要和平。”
    这位七十多岁的加拿大平民合作联盟全国理事会理事欧文还说，“中国的权利正遭到侵犯。中国将为抵抗侵略而起来自卫，但它不会发动侵略战争。”
    他还指出，“我们重视中国将决不会允许军国主义者或帝国主义者再来蹂躏它。”
    欧文指责了美国在台湾的立场是“荒唐的”。他说，“许多西方领袖对美国坚持它对台湾的愚蠢行径感到气愤。”
    当时在场的访华团的其他二位团员：彼得逊夫人和斯蒂文斯也表示同意这些看法。
    威廉·欧文团长在谈到发展加拿大和中国两国的友好关系时，他认为首先加拿大应该承认新中国，从而消除两国之间本来不应该存在的愚蠢的障碍。他主张两国应该建立起贸易关系和加强两国人士的友好往来。
    在谈到在中国访问十多天来的印象时，威廉·欧文团长说，我们代表团对在中国的访问感到很大的愉快和受到了教育。“我们对新中国在短短时间内所取得的巨大进展感到惊奇并留下了深刻的印象。
    他说，我们看到了中国人民的幸福生活以及他们建设的热情。“这对我们说来是一个很大的鼓舞。”
    威廉·欧文团长说，他曾参观了中国的钢铁工业和小型工业。他认为在很短时间内，中国人民将能很好地满足他们经济上的需要。
    威廉·欧文团长还赞扬中国的人民公社。他说，看来人民公社对中国的情况特别适合。“我们相信，人民公社使农业取得了重大的成就，如果没有人民公社，这些成就是很难获得的。”威廉·欧文团长还对中国教育与生产劳动相结合的方针感到特别有兴趣。他说，在西方世界里，特权阶级认为劳动是对他们的一种侮辱，因此也看不起劳动人民。但是在新中国的教育制度使劳动受到了尊重。
