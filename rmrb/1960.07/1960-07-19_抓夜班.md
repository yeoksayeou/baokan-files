　　Grasp the Night Shift
　　Wang Pu
    When the sun sets in the west and night falls, people often think that a day's work should be over and it's time to go home and rest. However, for many of our factories and mines, production does not stop because it is dark. There, people rest, but machines do not. From morning to night, and from night to morning, production is boiling and advancing day and night.
      Since production is advancing day and night, then, in
  the night, just like in the daytime,
  problems will inevitably arise. For these problems,
  timely and thorough solutions
  can ensure the normal progress of production.
  Otherwise, production will be
  affected. Therefore, at night,
  there should also be leading cadres on duty
  and the cooperation of various auxiliary
  departments. That is to
  say, the leadership and
  various management tasks of enterprises should also
  be carried out day and night,
  instead of "working at sunrise
  and resting at sunset." The reasoning
  is very clear. But there are
  some enterprise leaders who focus heavily on daytime
  production, but are lax in leading
  nighttime production. Not only do factory-level leading cadres rarely work on duty, but even workshop-level leading cadres rarely do. Nighttime production is often managed by only one duty foreman, who cannot solve relatively major problems on the spot. As a result, nighttime production often lags behind daytime production.
    Nighttime production is both a continuation of daytime production and a prelude to daytime production. Problems that occur in nighttime production cannot be resolved in a timely manner, which not only hinders nighttime production but also hinders the normal progress of daytime production. Nighttime production is so important, but some enterprises only focus on daytime shifts and not on or rarely on nighttime shifts, which shows that the leadership of these enterprises is not comprehensive enough, not specific and meticulous enough, and the work style is not down-to-earth.
    It is a great progress for leading cadres to go from never working on duty to working on daytime shifts, from not going deep into the front lines of production to going deep into the front lines of daytime shifts, from not grasping things specifically to grasping daytime shifts specifically. This has a great effect on the development of production and on improving the relationship between leaders and the masses. However, we must not stop here, but should continue to move forward on this basis. We must not only focus on daytime shifts but also on nighttime shifts. During the daytime shifts, leading cadres and workers eat, live, work, and discuss things together; during the nighttime shifts, leading cadres and workers must also eat, live, work, and discuss things together. Daytime shifts implement "three combinations," and nighttime shifts must also implement "three combinations." We must ensure that the established set of Marxist-Leninist leadership methods and leadership styles play a role day and night.

### 抓夜班

　　抓夜班
　　王朴
    每当日落西山，夜幕降临的时候，人们想到的往往是一天工作该结束了，该回家歇一歇了。但是，对我们的许多工厂矿山来说，生产并没有因为天黑而停顿下
  来。在那里，人歇机器不
  歇，从早到晚，又从晚
  到早，生产在夜以继日
  地沸腾着，前进着。
      既然生产在夜以继
  日地前进着，那么，在
  夜晚也会跟白天一样，
  难免出现这样或那样的
  问题。对于这些问题，
  解决得及时、彻底，就
  可以保证生产的正常进
  行。反之，生产就会受
  到影响。因此，在夜晚，
  也应当有领导干部跟班
  劳动，也应当有各个辅
  助部门的配合。也就是
  说，企业的领导工作和
  各种管理工作，也应当
  是夜以继日地进行着，
  而不应当是“日出而
  作，日入而息”。道理
  本来是很清楚。但是有
  一些企业领导对白班生
  产抓得很狠，对夜班生
  产的领导却很松，不但厂级领导干部极少跟班劳动，连车间的领导干部也极少跟班劳动。夜班生产往往只有一个值班工长当家，发现比较重大的问题当场解决不了。结果，夜班生产常常赶不上白班。
    夜班生产既是白班生产的继续，又是白班生产的前奏。夜班生产发生的问题不能及时解决，不但妨碍夜班的生产，也妨碍白班生产的正常进行。夜班生产这样重要，有些企业只抓白班，而不抓或少抓夜班，这说明这些企业的领导工作还不够全面，还不够具体细致，作风还不够踏踏实实。
    领导干部从不跟班劳动到跟白班劳动，从不深入生产第一线到深入白班第一线，从不具体地抓到具体地抓白班，乃是一个很大的进步。这对生产的发展，对改进领导和群众的关系，都有很大的作用。但是，我们决不能就此止步，而应该在这个基础上继续前进。我们既要狠抓白班，也要狠抓夜班。白班，有领导干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量；夜班，也一定要有领导干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。白班搞“三结合”，夜班也要搞“三结合”。我们一定要使已经形成的一套马克思列宁主义的领导方法、领导作风，夜以继日地发挥作用。
