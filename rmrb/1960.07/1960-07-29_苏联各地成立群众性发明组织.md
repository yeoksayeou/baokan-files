In many Soviet enterprises, a new form of mass invention and creation organization—the social design bureau—has recently emerged. Through this organization, workers are utilizing their spare time and working without compensation to carry out a great deal of work for establishing new technologies.

This type of organization has been widely welcomed as soon as it appeared and has grown rapidly everywhere. It is reported that in Sverdlovsk, about 150 social design bureaus were established in a very short period. All the main workshops of the Ural Cable Factory have established social design bureaus.

This type of organization plays a significant role in promoting production and completely mechanizing and automating the production process. For example, when the Ural Electrical Equipment Factory was trial-producing one of the world's largest 150,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators, it encountered difficulties in boring the stator casing. The factory did not have a machine that could bore such a large component. If the old machine tools were to be modified for use, it would take at least four months. The members of the social design bureau added a part to the machine tool, which eliminated the need for the modification process and shortened the process to one month.

    苏联各地成立群众性发明组织
    苏联许多企业里最近兴起了一种新形式的群众发明创造组织——社会设计局，职工群众通过这种组织利用业余时间、不要报酬地为建立新技术而进行着大量工作。
    这种组织刚一出现就受到了广泛的欢迎，在各地迅速生长起来。据报道，在斯维德洛夫斯克市，在很短期间就建立了约一百五十个社会设计局。乌拉尔电缆工厂所有的主要车间都建立了社会设计局。
    这种组织在推动生产，使生产过程全盘机械化和自动化方面有重大作用。例如，乌拉尔电气设备工厂在试制一台世界上最大的、十五万瓩的水力发电机时，在搪定子壳时遇到了困难。工厂没有一台机器能搪这么大的部件。如果要把旧机床改装使用，至少要四个月的时间。社会设计局的成员们给机床增加了一种零件，就免去了改装的过程，使这道工序缩短到一个月就完成了。
