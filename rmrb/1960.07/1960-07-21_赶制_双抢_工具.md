    Rushing to Produce "Double抢" Tools
    The early rice in Chenzhou Special District, Hunan Province, is growing well this year. It will be fully harvested in about a month, and the late rice must be transplanted before the Beginning of Autumn. In order to support the "Double 抢" (rush harvesting and planting), the financial and trade departments in the district have organized more than 15,000 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to step up the repair and manufacture of new-style tools such as rice harvesters, threshers, and rice transplanters. The financial and trade departments in Yizhang County not only organized specialized production, but also mobilized more than 10,000 commune members to repair and manufacture tools. Now, the county has produced and supplied over 72,000 pieces of new-style tools such as threshers, harvesters, and rice transplanters to the communes, and more than 240,000 pieces of bamboo baskets and sickles. It has also repaired a large number of other "Double 抢" tools.

    赶制“双抢”工具
    湖南省郴州专区今年早稻生长良好，再过一个月左右就要全面收割，而晚稻又必须在立秋以前插下。为了支援“双抢”，全区财贸部门已组织铁、木、竹业工人一万五千多人，加紧修理和制造割禾器、打稻机、插秧机等新式工具。宜章县财贸部门不仅组织专业生产，还发动一万多个社员修造工具。现在全县已经生产和供应各公社打稻机、割禾器、插秧机等新式工具七万二千多件，箩筐、禾镰二十四万多件，还修理好大批其他“双抢”工具。
