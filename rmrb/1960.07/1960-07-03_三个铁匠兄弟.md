Three blacksmith brothers stepped into the commune Party committee's door, three applications to join the Party came into their view. The Party committee secretary, with a beaming smile, walked forward with the applications: "The Party committee has discussed your requests. Come, write what's in your hearts on them." The blacksmiths' eyes suddenly brightened, happiness flooding their dark faces! The blacksmiths' hearts suddenly grew hot, like a fire ignited in their chests! Dipping their pens full of excitement, they filled in the blanks, one by one; but the three pens suddenly stopped, at the line for "Resume." As if an invisible hand plucked a forgotten string, the three blacksmith brothers suddenly recalled the past—thirty years ago, one spring, the three brothers had just come of age, taking their blacksmithing tools, and leaving their home with their father. One cruel, cold night, the old blacksmith froze to death before the Buddha statue in a dilapidated temple, leaving the three brothers beside his stiff body, helpless, wandering in a foreign land. An old, broken handcart was all the inheritance the old blacksmith had left, three hammers, four pairs of pliers, passing down the bitterness of the older generation. Young arms! Had to lift the heavy hammer. It smashed countless broken copper and scrap iron, but could not break the fences of poverty! Hebei's mixed noodles, Henan's bran, a desolate road saw away the blacksmiths' youth, the beards on their faces grew thicker and thicker, the three brothers, still three poor men. The red flag swept open a smooth road, the cooperative became the end point of the small handcart, the three brothers joined the ironwork group, the melody of life was set from this string. The wonderful days arrived in 1958, a smooth journey on the spring tide, Chairman Mao pointed the way at the bow, the People's Commune appeared before our eyes. In the desolate countryside of the past, the smoke of farm tool factories rose, the three blacksmith brothers took charge of three workshops. No longer just repairing a few hoes, mending a few sickles, the small handcart was long sent to the commune's exhibition hall, they were going to build new-style farm tools to build the socialist spring! The three blacksmiths' eyes blurred, tears flowed down their pens, they wrote their bitter and happy experiences together before the Party committee secretary...

    三个铁匠兄弟
    元辉三个铁匠兄弟，跨进公社党委的门槛，三张入党申请书，映进他们的眼帘。党委书记笑容满面，拿着申请书走向前：“你们的请求党委讨论了，来，把你们心里话写在上面。”铁匠的眼睛突然闪亮了，幸福涌上黝黑的脸！铁匠的心突然发热了，像一团火在胸膛里点燃！蘸饱激动的笔尖，把一栏栏空格填满；可是三支笔忽然停住了，下面的项目是履历栏。像有一只无形的手，拨响一根遗忘的弦，三个铁匠兄弟，一下子忆起往年——三十年前一个春天，兄弟三个刚刚成年，带着打铁的工具，跟父亲离开家园。一个冷酷的寒夜，老铁匠冻死在破庙的佛像前，僵尸旁留下兄弟三个，无依无靠，流落在异乡。一辆破旧的小挎车，是老铁匠留下的全部遗产，三把铁锤，四把钳，传下老一辈的辛酸。年轻轻的臂膀啊！要举起沉重的铁锤，它砸碎了多少破铜烂铁，可就砸不碎穷苦的栅栏！河北的杂面，河南的糠，凄凉的路送走了铁匠的青年，嘴边的胡子越长越密了，兄弟三个，依旧是三条穷汉。红旗扫开了平坦的路，合作社成了小挎车的终点，兄弟三个加入了铁业小组，生活的调子从此定了弦。美好的日子到了1958年，一路春水顺风船，毛主席船头指航路，人民公社现眼前。往日荒凉的农村，冒起农具厂的煤烟，三个铁匠兄弟，掌管了三个车间。再不只是修几把锄头，补几把镰刀，小挎车早送进公社展览馆，他们要造出新式的农具，去建设社会主义的春天！三个铁匠眼睛模糊了，泪水流下了笔尖，他们把苦难和幸福的经历，一齐写在党委书记面前……
