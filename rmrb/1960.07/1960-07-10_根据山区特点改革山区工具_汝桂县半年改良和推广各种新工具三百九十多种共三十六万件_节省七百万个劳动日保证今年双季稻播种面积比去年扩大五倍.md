Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: Ru Gui County, Hunan Province, fully mobilized the masses and developed a tool reform movement centered on agricultural production, adapting to local conditions based on the characteristics of the mountainous area. In the past six months, the county has improved and promoted 391 kinds of new tools, totaling more than 360,000 pieces, greatly reducing labor intensity, improving labor efficiency, and promoting the great development of various productions.

    Based on the characteristic of inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas, Ru Gui County first carried out transportation tool reform, extensively repaired field roads, and vigorously promoted cart transportation, chutes, and slides. Now, the county has repaired 1,850 various roads, totaling 5,540 kilometers; promoted 1,020 ox-carts and horse-carts, and 21,440 hand-pulled carts; and built more than 7,600 chutes, slides, and cableways. Basically eliminating shoulder carrying. Zhaiqian Commune is located 1,500 meters above sea level, and farmers go uphill when they leave the house and downhill when they return home. In the past, transporting fertilizer to the fields relied entirely on manual labor. This spring, due to the construction of 134 cart roads, the use of 336 ox-carts, and the use of locally sourced Phyllostachys edulis to erect 345 aerial cableways with a length of 141 kilometers, this year's agricultural production not only seized the season, but also expanded the area of double-cropping early rice by 12,000 mu, and expanded the planting of grain and forest intercropping by 15,000 mu. According to the characteristics of mountainous areas, all communes in the county have also created and promoted the use of 12,000 new-style walking plows, 11,749 various rice transplanters, 36,608 cultivators, 11,000 fertilizer applicators, 7,800 rice harvesters, and 3,348 rice threshers, fully realizing a "one-stop" tool reform. Based on the characteristics of many small mountain streams, the county has also established 1,339 hydropower stations, with an average of one hydropower station per production team.

    In the tool reform movement, all communes also paid attention to manufacturing, promotion, and consolidation at the same time. From the county and commune to the team and group, people were assigned to be responsible at all levels. The county party committee designated the secretary in charge of agriculture to take special charge of tool reform, and the commune party committee and brigade general branch were headed by the deputy secretary. At the same time, professional teams were established according to the different conditions of various tools, and technical training was carried out. Now, there are 10,004 professional teams and groups using various new tools in the county.

    With the large-scale promotion and use of new tools, labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Through tool reform, the county has saved a total of 7 million labor days in the past six months. This year, the double-cropping rice area has expanded from 30,000 mu last year to 190,000 mu, and the area of wasteland reclamation, expansion of planting, and grain-forest intercropping has increased by 2 million mu compared with last year. This year's early rice transplanting was the earliest-completed county in the province. Other productions have also seized the season and are being carried out quickly and well.

    根据山区特点改革山区工具
    汝桂县半年改良和推广各种新工具三百九十多种共三十六万件
    节省七百万个劳动日保证今年双季稻播种面积比去年扩大五倍
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省汝桂县根据山区特点，充分发动群众，因地制宜地开展以农业生产为中心的工具改革运动。半年来全县共改良和推广各种新工具三百九十一种、三十六万多件，大大减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动效率，促进了各项生产大发展。
    汝桂县根据山区交通不便的特点，首先开展运输工具改革，大修田间道路，大搞车子化和溜槽、滑道。现在全县已修好各种道路一千八百五十条，长达五千五百四十公里；推广牛拉车和马拉车一千零二十部，人拉车二万一千四百四十部；建溜槽、滑槽、索道七千六百多条。基本上消灭了肩挑。寨前公社地处拔海一千五百米，农民出门就上山，回家就下岭。过去送肥到田全靠人力运送。今春由于修大车路一百三十四条；使用三百三十六部牛拉车，并就地取材，用楠竹架起了三百四十五条长一百四十一公里的空中索道，使今年的农业生产不仅抢住了季节，还扩大一万二千亩双季早稻，扩种和粮林间作一万五千亩。全县各公社还根据山区特点，创造推广使用新式步犁一万二千部，各种插秧机一万一千七百四十九部，中耕器三万六千六百零八部，施肥器一万一千部，割禾器七千八百部，打稻机三千三百四十八部，全面实现了工具改革“一条龙”。根据山溪多水小的特点，全县还建立了水力动力站一千三百三十九个，平均每个生产队有一个水力动力站。
    在工具改革运动中，各公社还注意做到边制造、边推广、边巩固。从县、社到队、组，层层确定专人负责，县委确定管农业的书记专抓工具改革，公社党委、大队总支均由副书记抓，同时根据各种工具不同情况，成立专业队伍，并进行了技术训练。现在全县有各种使用新工具专业队、组一万零四个。
    随着新工具的大量推广使用，大大提高了劳动工效。全县通过工具改革，半年来共节省七百万个劳动日。今年双季稻由去年三万亩扩大到十九万亩，开荒扩种和粮林间作，比去年增加二百万亩。今年早稻插秧是全省结束最早的一个县。其他各项生产也抢住了季节，搞得又快又好。
