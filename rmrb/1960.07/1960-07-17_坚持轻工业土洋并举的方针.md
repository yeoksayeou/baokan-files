Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, Qinghai Province's light industry is advancing at an unprecedentedly rapid pace, adhering to the policy of simultaneously developing indigenous and foreign methods. The total output value completed in 1959 increased by 74% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The number of factories increased from 288 in 1957 to 4,603. The light industry system increased from ten to thirty-six. The number of products increased from more than 500 to 2,000, of which more than 1,000 have achieved self-sufficiency. Many products that had never been produced before, such as machine-made paper, machine-made sugar, cigarettes, red alum, paper-making, wool cloth, blankets, rayon, as well as various plastic products, rubber products, glassware, dry batteries, canned goods, beer, knitted goods, cultural and sports goods, etc., have been put into production, basically ending the history of our province's reliance on outside supply for light industrial products.

In the first spring of the 1960s, the face of light industry in our province is changing with each passing day, advancing rapidly. Since January, workers have put forward a total of more than 156,000 rationalization proposals in the mass movement of vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, of which more than 96,000 have been implemented. Among these, there are 1,425 reformed important machines, single-machine automatic points,联动线 (liandongxian, meaning "linkage lines," but I have no idea how this relates to machinery), and automatic lines. In March, the light industry system in the Xining area adhered to using indigenous methods for innovation, and achieved gasification in just over 20 days, which can save more than 200,000 tons of raw coal annually. Thanks to technological innovation, the output value and production plans have been completed very well. In the first half of this year, the output value of light industry exceeded the plan by 5.5%, an increase of 70% over the same period last year, fundamentally reversing the old production routine of "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year." In technological innovation, the workers also overcame various difficulties with the bold spirit of "we should have what others have, and we should also have what others don't have." Since the beginning of this year, the light industry system has trial-produced 350 new products that were previously considered impossible to produce under poor technical and equipment conditions, such as red alum, fine white porcelain, copper mesh, plush, synthetic detergents, and artificial marble. Many products have been produced in batches. The light industry system has also produced a large number of carriage bearings, drainage rubber pipes, seeding machine rubber pipes, drainage machine cast iron pipes, as well as pickaxes, iron shovels, rubber-wheeled carts, rickshaws, ceramic water pipes, etc., to support agricultural and animal husbandry production.

The light industry system of Qinghai Province has developed from nothing to something, from small to large, because it has resolutely implemented the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and adopted methods such as making use of simple conditions, using local materials, starting with indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In the past, the province only had a small number of handicraft factories and workshops, but now it has mechanized and semi-mechanized enterprises. At present, modern paper mills, sugar refineries, wool textile mills, cotton textile mills, and other light industrial factories are being actively built. The relatively underdeveloped Qaidam area also wants to build factories. The workers said, "As long as the leadership is determined and we are full of energy, we are not afraid of any difficulties." They built with their own hands and wisdom using indigenous methods. In the past year or so, more than 100 factories for paper-making, leather, glass, ceramics, sugar-making, and brewing have been built, with more than 1,000 products, supplying market needs and changing the situation where everything had to rely on outside supply in the past. Many counties and people's communes have started with indigenous methods and established many light industrial factories, and production has risen rapidly. The total industrial output value completed by the Houzihe People's Commune in Xining City last year was more than twice the total industrial output value of the entire province (excluding handicrafts) during the rule of the Ma bandits before liberation.

According to the requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee: "Vigorously develop light industry and handicrafts, strive to achieve self-sufficiency in most major products, and supply the people with more necessities of life," the total output value of light industry and handicrafts in the province should increase by 100% compared with 1959, and the variety should reach about 4,000 kinds. The quality is also required to be greatly improved. The production of machine-made paper, plastic products, daily-use glass, and sugar will increase by two to thirty times; the production of leather shoes, leather, small hardware, edible vegetable oil, and milk powder will increase by 21% to 95%.

To complete this glorious and arduous task, we must first strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and conscientiously implement the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. Practice has proved that this is an invincible road. In the past two years, due to the great achievements, some comrades have only paid attention to the production of foreign factories using foreign methods, and have not paid enough attention to the production of indigenous factories established by counties and communes using indigenous methods. Some comrades believe that we now have the conditions to build foreign factories, and we can build fewer indigenous factories. These ideas essentially reflect that some comrades have not yet thoroughly understood and recognized the policy of simultaneously developing indigenous and foreign methods, "walking on two legs," but regard the policy of "walking on two legs" as an "expedient." In response to these ideas, we have carried out active and positive education in a timely manner, so that they can realize the great significance of large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises working together to accelerate my country's socialist construction. In the past two years, due to our active development of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" enterprises, we have fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the prefectures, counties, localities, and people of all ethnic groups to run industries, rationally utilized resources and manpower, and changed the desolate situation of a few people running light industry in the past. At the same time, "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" enterprises also have the characteristics of fast construction, low cost, and easy mastery of production technology, which is of greater significance in our province, where the original industrial base was very weak and "poor and blank."

In the past two years, Qinghai Province's light industry has gained many experiences and lessons in implementing the policy of "walking on two legs." Enterprises such as wool textile mills, copper mesh mills, and paper mills, which were originally designed to adopt foreign methods of production, could not be launched for a long time due to high requirements and complex technical equipment. After deciding to start with indigenous methods in the second half of last year, the enthusiasm of the workers was immediately mobilized, and they quickly put them into production after only a few months. The Qinghai Wool Textile Mill made use of simple conditions, used local materials, and made seven wooden looms and sixty spinning wheels by itself. At the beginning, they were all hand-pulled and foot-operated, but now they have all been converted to electric power. At present, this factory has been built into a medium-sized textile enterprise with the production of bouncing, spinning, weaving, and dyeing. After Qinghai Copper Textile Mill manufactured more than 30 sets of indigenous machines for copper melting, rolling, wire drawing, and net weaving, it produced paper-making copper mesh in batches, which promptly met the requirements of the paper-making industry. The workers personally felt that: "Sitting and waiting for foreign machines wastes time, and starting with indigenous methods is immediately effective." It can be seen from this that there is no basis for the view that indigenous production and "small foreign groups" enterprises are regarded as "expedients."

We have personally experienced that "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" enterprises have great advantages, but we do not in the slightest belittle the importance of "large foreign groups" enterprises. Large-scale enterprises have the advantages of large-scale enterprises, such as high output, high efficiency, low cost, and many varieties. They are the backbone of socialist industry and cannot be ignored at any time. However, walking fast with only the "large foreign groups" leg is not possible; we also need the "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" leg to be able to run swiftly. It should be said that in developing light industry, big has the advantages of big, and small has the advantages of small. "Walking on two legs" is indispensable. This year, we want to complete a larger production plan than last year, and only by continuing to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" can we achieve a complete victory.

The further development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and transportation in Qinghai Province and the abundant resources have created extremely favorable conditions for the high-speed development of light industry. At present, the main thing is how we can give greater play to our subjective initiative to adapt to the development of objective situations. In vigorously developing light industry, we must continue to seize the central link of technological innovation and technological revolution, and as soon as possible change the manual operation of the light industry sector to mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated production. Continue to advocate breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and carrying forward the communist style of combining daring to think and daring to do with scientific analysis among all employees; closely combine with current production, formulate innovation plans, vigorously promote collaboration, exchange experiences, strengthen scientific and technological research, and make the experience of technological innovation and technological revolution "summarize a batch, consolidate a batch, promote a batch, and improve a batch," and push the innovation movement of light industry in our province to a new peak.

Secondly, vigorously open up sources of raw materials, vigorously engage in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, so that one thing can be used for multiple purposes, and waste products are not wasted, which is an important way to develop light industry at a high speed. At present, we must firmly grasp the production and supply of raw materials, and cooperate with commercial and agricultural departments to establish raw material production bases, and gradually fix the raw material supply areas and supply relationships. All prefectures, counties, and people's communes must attach importance to the production and supply of light industrial raw materials, and put this year's production targets on a reliable material basis. All production enterprises must also vigorously save raw materials and continuously reduce consumption quotas. An important measure to save raw materials is to develop diversified operations and vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization, and improve the utilization rate and yield rate of raw materials. Therefore, all light industrial enterprises should, on the premise of ensuring quality, try their best to recycle waste products and scraps and the scraps of large factories, actively carry out diversified operations and vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization, to meet the needs of production development.

Thirdly, actively develop urban and rural people's commune industries, which is an important task of the light industry and handicraft management departments this year, and we must do a good job in this work. Help commune industries resolutely implement serving agricultural production, better support agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation, and make full use of local raw materials and materials to produce more products. The light industry department should link up with the communes, formulate plans, and drive the commune industry. Commune industries should make as much use as possible of agricultural and sideline products to produce and process finished or semi-finished products to meet the needs of cities and commune members. Street commune industries should actively produce daily necessities, undertake processing of materials supplied by large factories, and at the same time vigorously develop service businesses, serve urban residents, serve agricultural and animal husbandry production, and serve large industries. Some departments and large factories should also provide strong support to urban and rural commune industries in terms of technical equipment, raw materials, and manpower.

At present, the situation on the light industry and handicraft front in our province is very good. The workers of the light industry system must, under the leadership of the Party, try their best to increase production, improve quality, and increase varieties, and strive for the self-sufficiency of most light industrial products and supply the people of all ethnic groups with more necessities of life.

    坚持轻工业土洋并举的方针
　　中共青海省委书记处书记　薛宏福
    青海省轻工业在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，坚持土洋并举的方针，以前所未有的跃进步伐向前奔驰。1959年完成的总产值比大跃进的1958年增加了74％。工厂数由1957年的二百八十八个增加到四千六百零三个，轻工业系统由十个增加到三十六个，产品由五百多种增加到两千种，其中已有一千多种达到了自供自给，许多过去从来没有生产过的产品如机制纸、机制糖、卷烟、红矾、造纸、毛布、毛毯、人造棉，以及各种塑料制品、橡胶制品、玻璃器皿、干电池、罐头、啤酒、针织品、文化体育用品等都已进行生产，基本结束了我省轻工业品依赖外地供应的历史。
    在六十年代的第一个春天，我省轻工业的面貌更是日新月异，高歌猛进。1月份以来，职工们在大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，提出的合理化建议共有十五万六千多件，已实现的达九万六千多件，其中改革的重要机具、单机自动点、联动线、自动线共一千四百二十五台。3月份内，西宁地区轻工业系统坚持用土办法搞革新，在短短的二十多天就一举实现了煤气化，全年可节约原煤二十多万吨。由于技术的革新，产值产量计划都完成的很好。今年上半年轻工业产值超额5.5％完成了计划，比去年同期增加了70％，从根本上扭转了“年末高、年初低”的生产旧常规。在技术革新中，职工们还以“别人有的我们应该有，别人没有的我们也应该有”的敢想敢干的风格，克服了各种困难。今年以来，轻工业系统试制出了过去认为在技术设备条件差的情况下，不可能制出红矾、细白瓷、铜网、长毛绒、合成洗涤剂、人造大理石等三百五十种新产品，许多产品已成批生产。轻工业系统还制出了大批马车轴承、排水胶管、播种机胶管、排水机铸铁管以及洋镐、铁铣、胶轮大车、人力车、陶瓷水管等，支援了农牧业生产。
    青海省轻工业系统由于坚决贯彻了党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，采取因陋就简、就地取材、土法上马、土洋并举等办法，使轻工业从无到有，从小到大地发展起来。过去全省仅有为数很少的手工工厂和作坊，现在已经有了机械化、半机械化的企业。目前，正在积极兴建现代化的造纸厂、制糖厂、毛纺织、棉纺织等轻工业工厂。过去基础较差的柴达木地区，也要办工厂，职工们说：“只要领导决心大，我们干劲冲破天，任何困难都不怕”。他们就凭着自己的双手和智慧用土办法建设。一年多来，已建起造纸、皮革、玻璃、陶瓷、制糖、酿酒等工厂一百多个，产品达一千多种，供应了市场需要，改变了过去任何东西都要依靠外地供应的局面。许多县和人民公社土法上马，兴办起许多轻工业厂子，生产迅速上升。西宁市后子河人民公社去年一年完成的工业总产值，比解放前马匪统治时期全省工业总产值（不包括手工业）还多两倍多。
    根据省委提出的要求：“大力发展轻工业、手工业，争取主要产品大部分自给，供应人民更多生活必需品”，全省轻工业、手工业的总产值要比1959年增长一倍，品种要达到四千种左右。质量也要求有很大的提高。机制纸、塑料制品、日用玻璃、食糖等将增产两倍到三十倍；皮鞋、皮革、小五金、食用植物油、奶粉等将增产21％到95％。
    要完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务，首先要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻执行党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。实践证明，这是一条无往不胜的道路。这两年来，由于取得了很大的成绩，有的同志就只注意洋厂子用洋办法生产，对县、社兴办的土厂子用土办法生产重视不够；有的同志认为当前我们办洋厂子已经有了条件，土厂子可以少办了。这些思想实质上反映了某些同志对土洋并举、“两条腿走路”的方针还没有深入透彻的了解和认识，而是把“两条腿走路”的方针当作“权宜之计”。针对这些思想，我们及时进行了积极的正面的教育，使他们认识到大型企业和中小型企业并举对加速我国社会主义建设的重大意义。这两年来，由于我们积极发展了“小土群”和“小洋群”企业，就充分发挥了州、县地方和各族人民办工业的积极性，合理地利用了资源和人力，改变了过去少数人办轻工业的冷冷清清的局面。同时，“小土群”和“小洋群”企业还具有建设快、花钱少、生产技术容易掌握等特点，这在我省原来工业基础十分薄弱、“一穷二白”的地区，就具有更加重大的意义。
    两年来，我省轻工业在贯彻“两条腿走路”方针中，是有不少经验和教训的。原来设计采取洋法生产的毛纺织厂、铜网厂、造纸厂等企业，由于要求高、技术设备复杂，迟迟不能上马，去年下半年决定先用土法上马以后，职工的积极性立即调动起来，只经过几个月的时间就迅速地投入生产。青海毛纺织厂因陋就简、就地取材，自制了七台木织机、六十台纺车，开始都是手拉脚踏，现在已全部改为电动。目前这个厂子已建成具有弹、纺、织、染等生产的中型纺织企业。青海铜纺厂自制了化铜压延、拔丝、织网等三十多台土机具后，成批生产造纸铜网，及时满足了造纸工业的要求。职工们亲身感受到：“坐等洋机器虚度光阴，土法上马立竿见影。”由此可以看出，把土法生产和“小洋群”企业当成“权宜之计”的看法，是没有丝毫根据的。
    我们亲身体验到了“小土群”和
  “小洋群”企业有很大的优越性，但丝毫也不贬低“大洋群”企业的重要性。大型企业有大型企业的好处，产量高、效率高、成本低、品种多，是社会主义工业的骨干，是任何时候都不能忽视的。但是，只有“大洋群”这一条腿走路是走不快的，我们还要有“小土群”和“小洋群”这条腿才能健步如飞。应该说，我们在发展轻工业中，大有大的好处，小有小的好处，“两条腿走路”缺一不可。今年，我们要完成比去年更大的生产计划，只有继续执行“两条腿走路”的方针，才能取得全面的胜利。
    青海省工、农、牧业和交通运输业的进一步发展和丰富的资源，对高速度发展轻工业创造了极为有利的条件。目前，主要在于我们如何更大地发挥主观能动性以适应客观形势的发展。在大力发展轻工业中，我们要继续抓住技术革新和技术革命这个中心环节，尽快地把轻工业部门的手工操作改变为机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化生产。在全体职工中继续提倡破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢干和科学分析相结合的共产主义风格；紧密结合当前的生产，制订革新规划，大搞协作，交流经验，加强科学技术研究，使技术革新和技术革命的经验做到“总结一批、巩固一批、推广一批、提高一批”，把我省轻工业的革新运动推向一个新的高峰。
    其次，大力开辟原料来源，大搞多种经营和综合利用，使一物多用，废品不废，这是高速度发展轻工业的一个重要的途径。目前我们要狠抓原材料的生产和供应工作，要和商业、农业部门协作建立原料生产基地，逐步把原料供应地区和供应关系固定下来。各州、县和人民公社都要重视轻工业原料的生产和供应工作，把今年的生产指标放在可靠的物质基础上。各生产企业单位还要大力节约原材料，不断降低消耗定额。而节约原材料的一个重要措施就是发展多种经营和大搞综合利用，提高原材料的利用率和出品率。因此，所有轻工业企业都应在保证质量的前提下，尽力回收废品废料和大工厂的下脚料，积极开展多种经营和大搞综合利用，以适应生产发展的需要。
    再次，积极发展城乡人民公社工业，这是轻工业和手工业管理部门今年的一项重要任务，我们必须作好这一工作。要帮助公社工业坚决贯彻为农业生产服务，更好地支援农业生产和农业技术改造，充分利用当地的原料、材料生产更多的产品。轻工业部门要和公社挂钩，制订规划，带动公社工业。公社工业要尽量利用农副产品，生产和加工成品或半成品，以满足城市和公社社员的需要。街道公社工业要积极生产日用小商品，承制大工厂的来料加工，同时大搞服务性业务，为城市居民服务，为农牧业生产服务，为大工业服务。有些部门和大的工厂还要从技术设备、原材料和人力等方面，给予城乡公社工业以大力支持。
    目前，我省轻工业和手工业战线的形势很好，轻工业系统的职工要在党的领导下，千方百计增加产量，提高质量，增加花色品种，为轻工业产品大部分自给、供应各族人民更多的生活必需品而奋斗。
