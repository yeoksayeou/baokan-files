　　Yushu County Arranges Four Seasons of Feed Supply
　　(Our Dispatch) The hog production in Yushu County, Jilin Province, has been continuously improving year by year and month by month. Last year, the total number of hogs in the county increased by more than double compared to 1958. Statistics at the end of June this year showed that the number of hogs in the county increased by about 80% compared to the end of 1959.
    The primary reason for the high-speed development of the hog raising industry in Yushu County is that the Yushu County Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly implemented the "two legs walking" policy of hog raising, "collective raising as the main focus, private raising as a supplement." Since last year, from the county to the commune, from the management district to the production team, more than 3,000 large, medium, and small-scale pig farms have been established at all levels. At the same time, most commune members' homes also raise one or two pigs.
    The high-speed development of the hog raising industry in Yushu County is due to the County Party Committee fully mobilizing the masses and adopting various methods to carefully arrange feed production. In solving the feed problem, all pig farms adhere to the principle of long-term planning and short-term arrangements, accounting for both the big picture of feed needed for the year and the detailed accounting of feed needed for each period. They account for the refined feed needed for various pigs, as well as the coarse feed needed for various pigs, formulating plans for production by category and by month. The main method is to divide the whole year into four production periods according to the production characteristics of various crops and wild plants: (1) Establishing feed bases in the spring. This year, the county has drawn more than 1,000 laborers, taking measures such as reclaiming wasteland and utilizing scattered land, to plant nearly 200,000 mu of soybeans, sorghum, cabbage, radish, etc. According to the annual hog raising plan, each pig will have nearly two-fen of feed land on average. (2) Summer Harvesting. Taking advantage of the favorable season of various wild plants growing in summer, large quantities of various wild grasses are collected and processed into various mold-fermented feeds through crushing, steaming, and boiling. (3) Autumn Storage. Storing various agricultural and sideline products and wild plants to make silage. (4) Winter Processing. In winter, various agricultural and sideline products and wild plants are processed into feed. The county has established more than 300 feed processing plants. Due to the above measures, each pig occupies 2,000 jin of green, coarse and refined feed throughout the year, basically guaranteeing supply. Due to the diversity and abundance of feed, all pig farms generally provide different quantities and qualities of feed according to the size and type of pigs, meeting the needs of hog development.
    In order to promote the high-speed development of hog production, all pig farms have greatly strengthened business management and epidemic prevention work. In production management, pigs are managed in separate groups and pens according to their size, gender, strength, and weakness, and are fed in single troughs. Strict management systems have been established, continuously improving the level of feeding management. In terms of disease prevention and control, the county has established a tight prevention and control network. In the past, pig cholera occurred every spring, causing large numbers of pig deaths. This year, various pig choleras have been basically controlled and eliminated, reducing the mortality rate of hogs from 5% last year to 2.3% in the first half of this year.
    In terms of business division of labor, county and commune-level pig farms mainly raise fine breeding pigs and breed piglets, with fattening as a secondary focus; management district and production team pig farms mainly focus on fattening and developing commercial fattened pigs; public canteens mainly focus on self-raising, self-breeding, and self-sufficiency, striving for surplus and selling it to the state; commune member families raise one or two pigs per household, raising them all and selling them to the state. Therefore, in the first half of this year, the county has raised more than 40,000 fattened pigs, overfulfilling the plan to sell live pigs to the state ahead of schedule.

### 长打算　短安排　算大账　算细账　榆树县安排四季供应饲料

　　榆树县安排四季供应饲料
    本报讯　吉林省榆树县生猪生产逐年逐月不断提高。去年，全县生猪存栏数比1958年净增一倍多。今年6月末统计，全县存栏生猪又比1959年末净增80％左右。
    榆树县养猪业高速度发展的首要原因，是中共榆树县委坚定地贯彻了“公养为主，私养为辅”的“两条腿走路”的养猪方针。从去年以来，由县到公社，由管理区到生产队，逐级办起三千多处规模不等的大中小型养猪场，同时大部分社员家中都养有一两头猪。
    榆树县养猪业能高速度发展，是县委充分发动群众，采取各种办法，周密安排了饲料生产。在解决饲料问题中，各养猪场都本着长打算，短安排的原则，既算一年所需饲料的大账，也算每个时期需要饲料的细账，既算各种猪需要的精细饲料账，也算各种猪需要的青粗饲料账，分类分月地制定规划，计划生产。主要办法是按各种农作物和野生植物的生产特点，将全年划为四个生产期：（1）春季建立饲料基地。今年全县抽出一千多名劳力，采取开垦荒地，利用零星土地等办法，种植大豆，高粱，白菜，萝卜等近二十万亩。按全年养猪计划计算，平均每头猪将近二分饲料地。（2）夏采。利用夏季各种野生植物丛生的有利时机，大量采集各种野草，通过粉碎、蒸煮等，加工成各种霉酵饲料。（3）秋贮。贮藏各种农副产品和野生植物，制成青贮饲料。（4）冬加工。在冬季将各种农副产物和野生植物加工成饲料。全县共办起三百多处饲料加工厂。由于采取上述措施，每头猪全年占有青粗精料二千斤，基本保证了供应。由于饲料多样、充足，各养猪场普遍作到了根据猪的大小和种类，分别供应不同数量、质量的饲料，满足了生猪发育需要。
    为促进生猪生产高速度地发展，各养猪场都大大加强了经营管理和防疫工作。在生产管理上，按猪的大小、公母、强弱，实行分群分圈管理和单槽饲养，并建立了严格的管理制度，使饲养管理水平不断提高。在疫病防治工作上，全县已建立了一个严密的防治网。过去，每逢春季，猪瘟发生，大批死猪，今年已基本控制和消灭了各种猪瘟疫，使生猪死亡率由去年的5％降低到今年上半年的2.3％。
    在经营分工上，县社级养猪场以养优良种猪，繁殖仔猪为主，育肥为辅；管理区、生产队养猪场以育肥为主，发展商品肥猪；公共食堂以自养、自育、自给为主，争取多余，卖给国家；社员家庭每户养一、二头猪，育成全部卖给国家。因而，今年上半年全县又育成肥猪四万多头，提前超额完成了向国家出售生猪的计划。
