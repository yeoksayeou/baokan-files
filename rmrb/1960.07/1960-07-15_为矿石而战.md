　　Fighting for Ore
　　By our reporter Wang Wenliang

　　Ore Transportation Soldiers
　　"Rumble, rumble, rumble," the 806 electric locomotive, fully loaded with iron ore, entered the ore yard, drove to the tippler, and was about to start tipping the ore at the unloading point. I hurriedly took out my camera, wanting to take a picture of it. But, just as the camera's aperture and speed were adjusted and I was focusing, a train of ore was already tipped. With a whistle, the locomotive headed back to the mountains.
　　The Party General Branch Secretary of the mine's transportation department, standing beside me, told me that this was another extraordinary new achievement created by the 806 electric locomotive in the battle for the third quarter. In the past, it took an hour to tip a train of ore. Later, they adopted the method of supplying steam while moving, shortening the time to six minutes at once. Recently, this locomotive team has carried out some reforms in labor organization, and the fastest time to tip a train of ore has been shortened to one and a half minutes. They are truly racing against time!
　　The 806 locomotive team is a red flag pacesetter locomotive team at the Bayan Obo Iron Mine. The entire team, including the driver, co-driver, shunter, and apprentices, totals twelve people, with an average age of less than twenty. But, despite their young age and lack of experience (most of them were new workers who joined the factory in 1958 and 1959), they work like tigers, like a group of "warriors" who cut through thorns.
　　This happened in March of this year. The mine's Party committee put forward the slogan of "Learn from Da Hushan, catch up with Da Hushan, surpass Da Hushan" to all mine workers. Based on the call of the mine's Party committee, the leaders of the mine's transportation department analyzed the situation at that time and believed that in order to catch up with Da Hushan in terms of output with two-thirds fewer locomotives and vehicles, it was necessary to start from tapping the potential of equipment. Therefore, it was decided to launch the "ten-thousand-ton car" movement on the entire mine's transportation front (that is, each locomotive transports 10,000 tons per day, while the previous daily quota for each locomotive was only about 2,400 tons), and the task of breaking through the 10,000-ton daily transportation mark from the East Mine to the Central Lean Ore Yard was handed over to the 806 locomotive team.
　　This section of the line is seven kilometers long, including a 500-meter-long section with a 30‰ long slope. To transport 10,000 tons per day, the net load of ore per train must be doubled. They experimented several times in a row, but either overloading occurred, or the wheels spun in the air without moving forward. Initially, they used the method of adding anti-skid sand, but it didn't work. Forcing their way through easily caused damage to machine parts and grounding of electrical circuits. Under the personal ride of the Party General Branch Secretary and Director of the transportation department and the close cooperation of relevant units, each time they failed, they held a "three-in-one combination" meeting on the spot. After conducting multiple tests on the load of the locomotive's traction capacity, they greatly broke with right-leaning ideas, swept away conventions, and boldly increased the motor load from 550 amps to 650 to 700 amps, and the fuse (a type of fuse device) from 1200 amps to 1800 amps. Under absolutely safe conditions, they forced the locomotive to increase its traction according to people's will. However, when the overloaded train went uphill, the wheels slipped even more severely. At this time, some old workers from Anshan, inspired by the urgency of the situation, recalled that when the wheels spun in Anshan, they added some scrap copper and iron to the car. Could they also use the method of adding weight to the locomotive body this time? So, they immediately started to add scrap brake shoes weighing two and a half tons to the driving wheels. In this way, on the seventh attempt, they finally overcame the overload and climbed the big slope, opening a way for daily transportation of 10,000 tons.
　　This time, the 806 locomotive carried a total of ten tipper cars (the design stipulates six), and the load capacity of each tipper car was also increased from 60 tons to 80 tons, with a total traction of 800 tons, more than double the previous 360 tons. On this basis, they boldly broke through the speed limits stipulated by the design: 15 kilometers per hour uphill, 10 kilometers per hour downhill, and 30 kilometers per hour on flat ground, and changed it to 25 kilometers per hour uphill, 20 kilometers per hour downhill, and no restrictions on flat ground. Soon, they created a new record of high production and bumper harvest of "more loading and faster running" of 10,500 tons per day and 57,700 ton-kilometers per day, driving the entire mine to set off a new high tide of red flag competition for "daily transportation of 10,000 tons."
　　After the 806 locomotive created the miracle of transporting 10,000 tons per day on a steep slope of 30‰, in order to ensure high output with high transportation volume and promote the great leap forward in the mine's production, they did not leave their saddles and continued non-stop. With the attitude of "passing five passes and beheading six generals," they put forward proposals such as "relay transfer," "self-inspection and self-repair," "operation and inspection combined," and "safe driving" to the workers on the entire mine's transportation front. Now, these proposals have been implemented throughout the mine. Especially after the implementation of "operation and inspection combined" throughout the mine, the time for one operation and inspection has been shortened from the past 18 hours to 3 hours (the national regulation is 4 hours). The 806 locomotive team has been at the forefront of each locomotive in the implementation of these major innovation proposals. Now, it has not had any major or minor accidents for more than a year, and the average locomotive departure rate has reached 98%, becoming a red flag in the mine's "more loading and faster transportation."

　　The Master of the Electric Shovel
　　On the main ore mountain of the Bayan Obo Iron Mine in Inner Mongolia, large electric shovels, each over ten meters tall, wave their steel arms all day long, and their large buckets, wide enough to accommodate several people, are fighting for "more production and faster transportation" of ore.
　　These electric shovels are equipped with more than twenty generators and motors (the most has 36), as well as electrical connectors, contacts, clutches, etc. connecting these electrical equipment and various mechanical parts, like a small power plant, too many to count. With such complex equipment, as long as a problem occurs in one place, the electric shovel will "become temperamental" and stop moving.
　　The electric shovel is a "main general" in iron ore production. The tens of thousands of tons of ore produced by the mine every day all rely on them to load onto electric locomotives. Frequent accidents are unacceptable! So, in September of last year, the superiors designated Master Zhang Runyu, a veteran worker with nine years of experience, to lead nine new apprentices and establish an electrical repair team. For more than a year, they have been working day and night on various electric shovels, fighting intelligently and bravely against various hidden, exposed, or potential accidents, ensuring the normal operation of the electric shovels. Therefore, people call them the "masters of the electric shovel."
　　Here are some stories.
　　The retaining ring (a type of buffer device) on the main generator used to break once a week; repairing it took at least four hours of downtime. Electric shovel workers said this was a "long-bearded problem" - an old problem that could not be prevented. The workers of the electric shovel team were determined to conquer this fortress. They thought hard day and night, studied collectively, and after one failure after another, finally found a more reasonable installation position for the retaining ring than the original design, and thickened the retaining ring and enlarged the rivets, extending the life of the retaining ring by more than 50 times. For example, the high-voltage fuse tube on the electric shovel used to be made of porcelain, and it would break if you weren't careful during operation. In order to solve this problem, the workers of the electrical repair team found the mine's electricians to conduct research, brushed insulating paper with paint and electrical essence, rolled it into a cylinder, and inlaid copper tubes on both ends, turning the fuse tube, which originally broke with a touch, into something as strong as iron. Since then, there have been no more downtime accidents due to broken fuse tubes.
　　In this way, many accidents were eliminated before they even happened.
　　In addition to boldly revolutionizing modern equipment and preventing accidents in advance, the workers of this team, in order to fully master the initiative, also carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and boldly manufactured various complex electrical spare parts and components for the electric shovel, initially reversing the phenomenon of downtime waiting for materials that often occurred in the past due to insufficient spare parts and components.
　　In the past six months, the workers of this team, starting from a toolbox and two pliers, have self-made more than ten kinds of tool dies and three kinds of special tools, and have manufactured more than 800 frequently consumed spare parts and components for electric shovels, such as oil switches, DC distribution panel connectors, high-voltage circuit breakers, and fly knives. At the beginning, the production of these tool dies and special tools was still done manually, which could not meet the needs of the electric shovel. Later, they successfully self-made a pneumatic press, and the production efficiency generally increased by dozens of times. After the main processes were mechanized, they launched a major advance towards the mechanization of auxiliary processes. Cutting steel plates, copper plates; tailoring plastic cloth, planing, drilling, sawing, filing, wherever machines could be used, they tried their best to manufacture machines to replace manual operation.
　　In the past, if anything was lacking, they would reach out to the superiors for it; now, if anything is lacking, they would find a way to produce it themselves. Thanks to their hard work, the phenomenon of downtime that often occurred in the past due to insufficient spare parts and components has now been almost completely eliminated.

### 为矿石而战

　　为矿石而战
　　本报记者　王文亮
　　矿石运输兵
    “轰隆、轰隆、轰隆”，806电机车满载着铁矿石，进入矿石场，开到翻车线，就要往卸车地点起翻矿石了。记者急忙拿出照相机，想给它拍个照。但是，当照相机的光圈、速度刚刚调整好，正在对距离的时候，一列车的矿石已经翻完，鸣笛声中，机车又向山上开去了。
    站在我身旁的矿山运输部党总支书记告诉我，这是806电机车在决战三季度中创造的又一个不平凡的新成就。过去翻一列车矿石要用一小时。后来，他们采取走行给汽的办法，一下子缩短到六分钟。最近，这个机车组又在劳动组织方面进行了一些改革，翻一列车矿石的时间，最快已缩短到一分半钟。真是争分夺秒啊！
    806机车组，是白云鄂博铁矿的一个红旗标兵机车组。全组连司机、副司机、调车员、徒工都算在内，共有十二人，平均年龄还不到二十岁。可是，别看他们年纪轻，经验少（大部分是1958年、1959年才入厂的新工人），工作起来可一个个像老虎似的，犹如一群披荆斩棘的“勇士”。
    这是今年3月份的事。矿党委向全矿职工提出了“学大弧山、赶大弧山、超大弧山”的口号。矿山运输部领导上根据矿党委的号召，分析了当时形势，认为在机车车辆比大弧山少三分之二的情况下，要在产量上赶上大弧山，必须从挖掘设备潜力方面入手。因此，决定在全矿运输战线上开展“万吨车”运动（即每台机车日运万吨，过去每台机车的日定量仅为二千四百吨左右），并且把突破从东矿到中贫矿矿石场日运万吨关的任务交给了806机车组。
    这段线路全长七公里，其中有一段五百米长的线路，是千分之三十的长大坡道。要日运万吨，就必须把每列车的矿石净载量提高一倍。他们连续试验了好几次，不是发生超负荷现象，就是车轮光打空转，不前进。起初，他们用加防滑沙子的办法，没有生效；硬闯，又容易发生机件损坏、电线回路接地等事故。他们在运输部门党总支书记、主任亲自搭乘和有关单位的紧密配合下，每失败一次，就在车前召开一次战地
  “三结合”会。他们对机车牵引能力等的负荷量进行了多次试验以后，大破右倾，横扫常规，大胆地把马达负荷由五百五十安培提高到六百五十到七百安培，把可熔器（一种保险丝性质的装置）由一千二百安培，提高到一千八百安培，在绝对安全的情况下，逼使机车按照人们的意志提高牵引量。但是，超过负荷的列车上坡时，车轮打滑打的反而厉害了。这时候，从鞍山来的一些老工人，情急生智，想起在鞍山时车轮一打空转，就在车上加些碎铜碎铁，这次是不是也可以用加重机车车体的办法？于是，立即动手在动轮上加了重达两吨半的废闸瓦。这样，在第七次头上，终于超负荷闯上了大坡，为日运万吨开辟了一条道路。
    这一次，806机车一共带了十个翻斗车（设计规定六个），每辆翻斗车的载重量也由六十吨提高到八十吨，总牵引量达到八百吨，比过去的三百六十吨提高了一倍还多。在这个基础上，他们又大胆突破设计所规定的：上山每小时十五公里、下山十公里、平地三十公里的车速限制，改为上山二十五公里、下山二十公里、平地不作限制。不久，他们就创造了日运一万零五百吨、日产五万七千七百吨公里的“多拉快跑”高额丰产新纪录，带动全矿掀起了风起云涌的“日运万吨”的红旗竞赛新高潮。
    806机车在千分之三十的陡坡上创造了日运万吨的奇迹以后，为了以高运保高产，促进全矿生产大跃进，又人不离鞍、马不停蹄，以“过五关、斩六将”的姿态，向全矿运输战线上的职工，提出“接力换乘”“自检自修”“操捡合一”“安全行车”等倡议。现在，这些倡议已经在全矿推行。尤其是“操检合一”在全矿推行以后，一次作业检修时间，已经由过去的十八小时，缩短到三小时（国家规定是四小时）。806机车组在实现这些重大的革新倡议中，事事走在各机车的头里，现在，它已一年多没有发生过大、小事故，机车出车率平均达到98％，成为全矿“多装快运”方面的一面红旗。电铲的主人
    在内蒙古白云鄂博铁矿的主矿山上，一台台身高十几米的大电铲，整日挥舞着那钢铁的胳臂，和那宽宽绰绰地可以站下好几个人的大铲斗，在为“多产快运”矿石而战。
    这些电铲的肚子里，都装有二十台以上的发电机和电动机（最多的达三十六台），还有连接这些电器设备和机械各个部分的电线接头、接触点、离合器等，像一个小发电厂一样，多得数也数不清。这样复杂的设备，只要一个地方发生了毛病，电铲就会“要脾气”，停下不动了。
    电铲，是铁矿生产的一员“主将”。全矿每天生产的好几万吨矿石，全靠它们往电机车上装运。老发生事故还行！于是，去年9月，上级指定有九年工龄的张润宇老师傅，带领九名新徒工，成立了一个电钳组。一年多来，他们日日夜夜在各个电铲上，机智勇敢地和各种暗藏的、已经露头或可能发生的事故作斗争，保证了电铲的正常运行。因此，人们称他们是“电铲的主人”。
    有这样一些故事。
    主发电机上的档圈（一种缓冲装置），过去每星期坏一次；修理一次，起码要停车四小时。电铲工人都说这是“长起胡子来的毛病”——老毛病了，无法防止。电铲小组的工人决心要攻下这道堡垒。他们日夜苦思，集体研究，经过了一次又一次的失败，终于找到了比原来设计更合理的档圈安装位置，并且把档圈加厚，铆钉改大，使档圈寿命延长了五十多倍。又如，电铲上的高压保险丝管，过去是用磁做的，操作时一不注意就碰坏了。为了解决这个问题，电钳组的工人找来矿上的电工进行研究，用绝缘纸刷上油漆和电精，卷成圆筒，两头镶上铜管，使原来一碰就坏的保险丝管，变成和铁打的一样。从那以后，再也没有因为保险丝管坏发生过停机事故。
    就这样，许多事故还没有发生，就被他们消灭了。
    这个小组的工人，除了大胆地对现代化的设备进行革命，做到事先防止事故以外，为了把主动权完全掌握在自己手里，又发扬敢想敢干的精神，大胆制造电铲上各种复杂的电器备品备件，初步扭转了过去常常因为备品备件不足而发生的待料停机现象。
    半年多来，这个小组的工人，从一个工具箱，两把老虎钳子开始，自制了十多种工具胎和三种专用工具，已经制造了八百多件电铲上经常消耗的油开关、直流配电盘接头、高压断路器、飞刀等备品备件。开始的时候，这些工具胎和专用工具的生产还是人工操作的，满足不了电铲需要。后来，他们自制成功一种风动压力机，生产效率普遍提高了几十倍。主要工种机械化了，他们又向辅助工种机械化展开大举进军。切断钢板、铜板；剪裁胶布，刨光、钻眼、锯一锯、锉一锉，凡是能使用机器的地方，他们都千方百计制造出机器来代替手工操作。
    过去是缺什么，伸手向上级要什么；现在是缺什么，自己就想法生产什么。由于他们的辛勤劳动，过去常常由于备品备件不足而发生的停机现象，现在已经快杜绝了。
