    To Vietnam
    Bing Xin
  Six hundred and fifty million pairs of iron arms
  Reach towards Munan Pass, to our fighting Vietnamese brothers,
  We support you! Our common enemy,
  U.S. imperialism, how mad they are,
  How shameless they are! They occupy our sacred
  Territory of Taiwan, they divide your beautiful land
  Into two halves! The dividing line cannot sever the kinship, strict blockades cannot stop the fiery hearts! Peace! Unity! Are the angry cries of twenty-five million people, "In our hearts, there is only one homeland, one capital, one Ho Chi Minh!" Never mind the "Tenth Fascist Ordinance," never mind new weapons, guillotines,
  The hurricane and torrential rain of "Oppose the U.S.-Diem clique"
  Sweep up from the heads of the robbers; arrow-like rafts sailing smoothly downstream, fluttering with fighting red flags! The red flags flutter in the east wind, the songs of victory ripple in the morning sun—the paper tiger collapses under its feet, its lifespan will not be long! Forward, heroic Vietnamese people! The Chinese people are supporting you, the Asian people are supporting you, the people of the world are supporting you! The righteous struggle will surely be victorious! As long as we persevere to the end!

    寄越南
    冰心六亿五千万双铁臂
  伸向睦南关，斗争中的越南弟兄，
  我们支援你！我们共同的敌人，
  美帝国主义，他们是多么疯狂，
  他们是多么无耻！他们霸占了我们的神圣
  领土台湾，他们把你们的锦绣江山
  分成两半！分界线斩不断骨肉的亲情，严密封锁挡不住火热的心！和平！统一！是两千五百万人愤怒的呼声，“我们心目中，只有一个祖国，一个首都，一个胡主席！”管什么“第十号法西斯法令”管什么新武器，杀头机，
  “反对美吴集团”的狂风暴
  雨，从强盗头上卷起；飞箭般的乘风顺流的木筏，飘扬着面面战斗的红旗！面面红旗在东风里飞扬，胜利的歌声在朝阳中荡漾—纸老虎脚下土崩瓦解，他的寿命不会久长！前进吧，英勇的越南人民！中国人民在支援你，亚洲人民在支援你，世界人民在支援你！正义的斗争必然胜利！只要我们坚持到底！
