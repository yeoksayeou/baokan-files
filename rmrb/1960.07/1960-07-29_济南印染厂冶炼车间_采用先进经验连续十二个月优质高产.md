Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th July: The workers of the smelting workshop of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory in Shandong Province have maintained a pig iron qualification rate of over 90% for more than twelve months from the third quarter of last year to the present; the output in June this year also doubled compared with the same period last year.

This smelting workshop is a pace-setter in Shandong Province's steel industry. While striving for high output, they have also focused on pig iron quality from top to bottom, consistently adhering to the adoption of various advanced experiences, ensuring that both quality and output remain at a leading level in the country. In the first half of last year, the quality of pig iron in this workshop was not ideal. Since then, the workshop branch, following the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, first strengthened the education of employees, making it clear to everyone that to ensure the country refines good steel, there must first be good iron, and set a target of achieving a pig iron qualification rate of 96%, organizing employees to vigorously attack the high-sulfur barrier. To this end, the workshop's youth first organized the "Nine-Six" shock brigade, going deep into the site to find and break key problems. When the pig iron qualification rate reached the predetermined target, they proposed striving for a qualification rate of 100% and organized a "One-Zero-Zero" shock brigade. All the workshop's employees also organized competitions around quality and high output. The Party and the trade union also regularly organized workers to conduct inspections and evaluations from five aspects: ideology, quality, output, and operational safety, enabling employees to firmly establish the idea of high-quality, high-yield and overall leap forward.

Doing a good job in the processing of raw materials is one of the fundamental measures for this workshop to ensure high quality and high yield. For a long time, they have subjected ore powder to water and magnetic separation to remove impurities and sulfur, and then sintered it. Therefore, the grade of sintered ore reaches about 70%. For the raw materials entering the small blast furnace, they also strictly abide by the five-character measures of "small, dry, clean, ripe, and rich", improved the batching method, improved the desulfurization effect in the furnace, and promoted the experience of large wind and high temperature to improve pig iron output and quality.

Strictly implementing operating procedures is also an important factor for this workshop to achieve high quality and high yield. In terms of blast furnace operation, the regulations of "seven not entering the furnace" such as impurities not entering the furnace and materials with unqualified particle size not entering the furnace are strictly implemented. Now, workers have developed the habit of paying attention to the quality of raw materials at all times. Even if the loading worker sees a straw stick in the material, they will pick it out. This workshop also strictly implements various testing systems. The pig iron furnace is tested every furnace, the slag and sintered ore are tested every shift, and the raw materials are also tested in batches.

    济南印染厂冶炼车间
    采用先进经验连续十二个月优质高产
    新华社济南28日电　山东省济南印染厂冶炼车间的职工，从去年第三季度到目前的十二个多月中，生铁合格率一直保持在90％以上；今年6月份的产量也比去年同期增长了一倍。
    这个冶炼车间是山东全省钢铁工业方面的标兵。他们在力争高产的同时，从上到下都狠抓生铁质量，始终坚持采用各种先进经验，保证了质量、产量都稳居全国先进水平。去年上半年，这个车间的生铁质量并不理想。从那时起，车间支部就根据上级党委的指示首先加强对职工的教育，使大家明确了要保证国家炼出好钢就首先要有好铁的思想，并以生铁合格率达到96％作为目标，组织职工猛攻高硫关。为此，车间青年首先组织了“九六”突击队，深入现场找关键、破关键。当生铁合格率达到预定奋斗目标时，他们又提出争取合格率达到100％，并组织了“一零零”突击队。全车间职工也围绕优质、高产组织了竞赛。党和工会还经常组织工人从思想、质量、产量、操作安全等五个方面，进行检查和评比，使职工们巩固地树立了优质高产和全面跃进的思想。
    做好原料的加工处理，是这个车间保证优质、高产的根本性措施之一。长期以来，他们对矿粉都经过水选和磁选，除去矿粉中的杂质、硫分，然后再进行烧结。因此使烧结矿的品位达到70％左右。对小高炉的入炉原料，他们也严格地遵守了“小、干、净、熟、富”的五字措施，并改进了配料方法，提高炉内脱硫的效果，推广大风、高温等提高生铁产量质量的经验。
    严格执行操作制度，也是这个车间取得优质、高产的重要因素。在高炉操作方面，严格执行了杂质不入炉、料的粒度不合规格不入炉等“七不入炉”的规定。现在，工人们已养成随时都注意原料质量的习惯，上料工看到料里有一根草棒也要把它拣出来。这个车间还严格执行了各种化验制度。生铁炉炉化验，炉渣、烧结矿每班化验一次，原料也分批进行化验。
