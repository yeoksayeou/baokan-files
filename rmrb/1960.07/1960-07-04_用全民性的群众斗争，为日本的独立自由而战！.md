Fight for Japan's Independence and Freedom with a Nationwide Mass Struggle!
The heroic struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi, is like a prairie fire, burning across the entire Japanese territory. This struggle has achieved great victories, giving the U.S.-Japan reactionaries a heavy blow. It has written a glorious page in Japanese history.

The struggle of the Japanese people has received the full support of the Asian people and all peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people regard the struggle of the Japanese people as their own struggle, and the victory of the Japanese people as their own victory.

To help readers further understand the struggle of the Japanese people, we have compiled a photo page here. These pictures show the overview of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle from various aspects. (Photos attached)

Top: June 18, 350,000 people in Tokyo surrounded the Japanese Diet, holding an unprecedented grand demonstration rally to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke group's attempt to make the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty "naturally ratified."

Bottom: June 4, the Japanese people held their first political general strike to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal "passage" of the U.S.-Japan treaty. The picture shows taxi drivers going to Tokyo Station to support striking workers of the state-run railway.

Right: At four o'clock in the morning on May 20, 60,000 workers and students in Tokyo braved the rain to surround the Diet, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal forced "passage" of the U.S.-Japan treaty in the late night of the 19th.

Tokyo masses carry a model of Nobusuke Kishi, the running dog of U.S. imperialism, and hold a demonstration parade in the streets.

June 10, 100,000 people in Tokyo angrily surrounded Haneda Airport, holding a powerful demonstration against U.S. President Eisenhower's press secretary, Hagerty. The demonstrators surrounded Hagerty's car, and Hagerty had to escape the encirclement in a helicopter in the end. The top left picture shows Hagerty's besieged car. On top of the car are demonstrators. The two people next to it are bodyguards from the U.S. Embassy.

May 25, 3,000 workers in Tokyo went to Nobusuke Kishi's official residence to hold a sit-in demonstration. They insisted on fighting despite the persecution of the police.

Farmers in Gunma Prefecture actively participate in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan treaty and against U.S. military bases. The picture shows the scene of farmers holding a demonstration parade.

Late at night on May 19, the Kishi Nobusuke group summoned the police to take away all opposition party members and illegally forcibly passed the U.S.-Japan treaty. Socialist Party member Akira Ashika was beaten and injured by the police. The picture shows Akira Ashika being carried out of the Diet after being injured.

In order to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal forced passage of the "U.S.-Japan Treaty," members of the Japanese opposition parties, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, announced that they would refuse to participate in the "deliberation" work of the Diet's Upper House. The picture shows the Kishi Nobusuke group "deliberating" alone in the Diet's Upper House.
