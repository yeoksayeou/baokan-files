Earnestly Grasp Measures to Strengthen the Agricultural Front
Shaanxi Proposes Sixteen Requirements for Seizing an Autumn Bumper Harvest, Creating a New Situation in Agricultural Production
Hubei Grasps Expanding Cultivated Land Area to Strive for Balanced Production Increase and Increase in Paddy Fields Planting More High-Yield Crops
Jiangsu Adopts Methods of Protection, Reform, Drainage, Management, Squeezing, and Training to Ensure Sufficient Labor Force for Agriculture

(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 21) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely implements the policy of agriculture being the foundation of the national economy, and strives to strengthen leadership over the agricultural front in every possible way.

In order to seize this year's autumn bumper harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of secretaries of the prefectural (municipal) and county committees at the end of June to review and summarize the work of the first half of the year, and discuss and arrange the work for July, August, and September. On July 8, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued sixteen requirements on seizing the autumn bumper harvest, pointing out that combating drought to protect the autumn harvest, conserving resources to prepare for famine, and seizing an autumn harvest greater than the summer harvest is the central task of the people of the entire province, and they must go all out to ensure its realization. The sixteen requirements are: (1) Seize the opportunity to rush plant millet, buckwheat, mung beans and other short-season crops. On the basis of completing the autumn grain planting plan, strive to increase planting by about 10%. (2) Check seedlings and replant seedlings to ensure full stands. (3) Plant autumn vegetables on a large scale. Increase the planting of vegetables by an average of one fen per person throughout the province. (4) Focus on "insurance fields" to drive general fields. Each person should manage an average of one mu of "insurance field" to ensure a bumper harvest despite drought or flood. (5) Manage autumn cotton fields well. (6) Make full use of all irrigation facilities for timely irrigation. (7) Check for insects, prevent insects, and control insects at any time. (8) Combine crash fertilizer accumulation with regular fertilizer accumulation, with an average of 10,000 jin of fertilizer accumulated per person in July and August. Produce large quantities of indigenous and foreign chemical fertilizers. (9) Launch a well-digging campaign. (10) Seize the opportunity of dog days for deep plowing. (11) Take advantage of the rainy season to carry out afforestation and planting grass in a concentrated manner. (12) Implement the "three fixes and one category" system, and implement the "three guarantees" tasks for all autumn and cotton fields and next year's wheat fields to the production teams before late July. (13) Make overall arrangements, give prominence to key points, and concentrate more than 80% of the rural labor force on the front line of combating drought and protecting the autumn harvest. (14) Widely carry out the red banner competition movement centered on combating drought and protecting the autumn harvest. (15) All industries, including industry, commerce, transportation, grain, culture and education, and health, should launch a new upsurge in supporting drought resistance and production. (16) Leading cadres at all levels should go to the forefront of production and do practical work.

After the release of the "Sixteen Requirements for Seizing the Autumn Bumper Harvest" by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, in just six or seven days, a new and dynamic situation immediately appeared on the agricultural front of the province: more than 2.4 million laborers joined the battle to combat drought and protect the autumn harvest, and the task of increasing autumn planting by about 10% has been overfulfilled, the area of "insurance fields" is constantly expanding, field management is becoming more and more detailed, water and fertilizer overproduction measures are being increased again and again, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to resist drought and seize bumper harvests is being boosted again and again. Although the summer drought continues, most of the more than 30 million mu of autumn fields in the province are growing well.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 21) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee from June 25 to July 1, and decided to further implement the policy of agriculture being the foundation of the national economy, strengthen leadership over agriculture, concentrate greater efforts on agriculture, fight hard in July, August, and September, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1960.

The current agricultural production situation in Hubei Province is very good, and summer crops have achieved a bumper harvest. The planting area of ​​mid-season rice, which accounts for the largest proportion of grain production, has been expanded compared with last year. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the current central issue is to further strengthen leadership over agricultural production and concentrate efforts to focus on the agricultural front. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee decided to immediately concentrate sufficient labor to participate in the current field management. At the same time, a province-wide movement of urban support for rural areas, and support for agricultural production from all walks of life such as industry, finance and trade, culture and education, health, and science should be launched immediately. In terms of industry, greater efforts should be made to support the "four reforms and two eliminations" (reform of irrigation and drainage, transportation, cultivation and processing tools, and elimination of shoulder carrying and manual water lifting) movement in agricultural production.

The meeting summarized the experience of agricultural production in Hubei Province in recent years, and believed that to accelerate the development of agricultural production, it is necessary to continue to resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and at the same time, focus on the following fundamental measures: (1) Expand the cultivated land area. July, August, and September are good seasons for reclaiming wasteland, and while doing a good job in current field management, some efforts should be devoted to reclaiming wasteland; (2) Increase the yield per unit area, eliminate backwardness, catch up with advanced areas, and achieve balanced production increase. Each production team and team should find its own benchmarks and limit them to catch up with them in two or three years; (3) Change dry land to paddy fields and dry land to irrigated land; (4) Plant more high-yield crops, especially plant sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, radishes and other high-yield crops on a large scale.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that the important key to doing a good job at present is to further improve the leadership style and the style of the vast number of cadres, and fully carry forward the scientific spirit of combining daring to think and daring to act with seeking truth from facts. The Provincial Party Committee called on all cadres to develop a realistic, hard-working, in-depth, meticulous, and down-to-earth ideology and work style.

The decisions and calls of the Provincial Party Committee are rapidly turning into practical actions of the vast number of cadres and masses in Hubei Province. Thousands of cadres are going to the forefront of production with their luggage, to the most difficult places, and to backward areas. The provincial-level agricultural inspection group led by Zhang Tixue, secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the Province, departed on the 14th and 15th to carry out work in various counties in the Wuhan area. Many commune organs have moved their offices to the production teams to settle down. All labor that can be drawn out is being concentrated on the agricultural front.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 21) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over the socialist revolution and construction, use greater strength to accelerate the development of agriculture, and earnestly grasp ideological style, industrial and agricultural production, and people's lives. This requirement was put forward at a recent meeting of first secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county party committees.

During the meeting, Jiang Weiqing, first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made two reports. The meeting unanimously agreed that Jiangsu Province had achieved great results and realized a sustained great leap forward in all aspects of work in the first half of this year. In agriculture, except for a few areas where production was reduced or not increased much due to disasters, most areas in the province achieved a bumper harvest of more than 40 million mu of summer crops. Industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas have been done more effectively with leadership, planning, and organization than in the past. Industrial production, capital construction, and transportation have also greatly developed.

The meeting focused on discussing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and using greater strength to accelerate the development of agriculture. The meeting believes that in order to further improve agriculture, it is necessary to effectively solve the problem of rural labor. In terms of labor arrangement, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of focusing on agriculture, focusing on grain production, and focusing on current production, and always ensure that the vast majority of labor is used for agriculture. In the coming period, the development of industry should implement the principle of increasing production without increasing people, and even reducing people while increasing production. In order to comprehensively and effectively solve the rural labor problem, six words must be achieved, namely: "Protect", protect labor and care for labor; "Reform", vigorously carry out tool reform and agricultural technology transformation to reduce labor intensity and save labor; Improve labor productivity; "Arrange", arrange labor in a unified way by party committees at all levels; "Manage", manage labor in a unified way; "Squeeze", all walks of life squeeze out surplus labor to support agriculture and strengthen agriculture; "Train", train labor reserves and train technical talents. The meeting also discussed the four key points of focusing on grain, cotton, oil, and non-staple food throughout the province.

The meeting pointed out that the current situation on all fronts is very good. In future work, cadres at all levels must closely combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, closely combine daring to think, speak, and act with seeking truth from facts, and closely combine foresight with focusing on the present. The meeting called on the people of the province to further launch the mass movement of "Northern Jiangsu encourages and catches up with Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu reaches a new level" in agriculture, and to further launch the revolutionary competition of "Learning from Shanghai in the East and Catching up with Nanjing in the West" in industry to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward!

    切实抓紧措施加强农业战线
    陕西提出夺取秋季大丰收十六项要求农业生产出现崭新局面
    湖北狠抓扩大耕地面积争取平衡增产增加水田多种高产作物
    江苏采取保、改、排、管、挤、训等办法确保农业有足够劳力
    本报西安21日电　中共陕西省委坚决贯彻农业是国民经济的基础的方针，千方百计加强对农业战线的领导。
    为了夺取今年秋季大丰收，中共陕西省委在6月底召开了地（市）委、县委书记会议，检查总结了上半年的工作，讨论安排了7、8、9三个月的工作。7月8日，省委、省人委又发出关于夺取秋季大丰收的十六项要求，指出抗旱保秋，节约备荒，夺取秋季比夏季更大丰收，是当前全省人民的中心任务，必须全力以赴，保证实现。十六项要求是：（一）抓紧时机，抢种糜谷、荞麦、绿豆等小日月庄稼。在完成秋粮播种计划的基础上，力争增种10％左右。（二）查苗补苗，见缺就补，千方百计，保证全苗。（三）大种秋菜。全省平均每人增种一分菜。（四）大抓“保险田”，带动一般田。每人平均管好一亩“保险田”，旱涝保丰收。（五）管好秋棉田。（六）充分利用一切灌溉设施，适时灌溉。（七）随时查虫、防虫、治虫。（八）突击积肥与经常积肥相结合，7、8两月每人平均积肥一万斤。大制土、洋化肥。（九）开展打井运动。（十）抓紧伏天深耕地。（十一）利用雨季，突击造林、种草。（十二）贯彻“三定一类”制，把全部秋、棉田和明年麦田的“三包”任务，在7月下旬以前落实到生产小队。（十三）全面安排，突击重点，把80％以上的农村劳动力，集中用在抗旱保秋第一线。（十四）广泛开展以抗旱保秋为中心的红旗竞赛运动。（十五）工业、商业、交通、粮食、文教、卫生等各行业，掀起一个支援抗旱生产的新高潮。（十六）各级领导干部都要深入生产第一线，扎扎实实做工作。
    省委、省人委关于“夺取秋季大丰收的十六项要求”发布后，短短六、七天时间，全省农业战线立即出现了一个龙腾虎跃的崭新局面：二百四十多万名劳动大军投入了抗旱保秋战斗，要求增种10％左右的秋田任务已超额完成，“保险田”面积不断扩大，田间管理工作越作越细，水肥超产措施一加再加，广大社员抗旱夺丰收的干劲一鼓再鼓。虽然夏旱仍在持续，全省三千多万亩秋田大部分生长良好。
    本报武汉21日电　中共湖北省委于6月25日至7月1日举行了省委扩大会议，决定进一步贯彻执行农业是国民经济的基础的方针，加强对农业的领导，集中更大的力量搞好农业，大战7、8、9月，争取1960年农业生产大丰收。
    湖北省当前的农业生产形势很好，夏季作物获得了丰收。占粮食生产比重最大的中稻播种面积比去年有所扩大。省委认为，当前的中心问题是进一步加强对农业生产的领导，集中力量主攻农业战线。为此，省委决定，马上集中足够的劳动力来参加当前的田间管理。同时，立即掀起一个城市支援农村，工业、财贸、文教、卫生、科学等各行各业支援农业生产的全民性的运动。工业方面要以更大力量支援农业生产的“四改两消灭”（改革排灌、运输、耕作和加工工具，消灭肩挑和人力车水）运动。
    会议总结了湖北省几年来农业生产的经验，认为要加速发展农业生产，必须继续坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，同时要狠抓以下几项根本措施，即（一）扩大耕地面积。7、8、9三个月正是开荒的好季节，应在搞好当前田间管理的同时，抽出一部分力量搞好开荒；（二）提高单位面积产量，消灭落后，抓落后赶先进，达到平衡增产，每个生产队和小队都应找出自己的标兵，限定在二三年内普遍都赶上他们；（三）旱田改水田，旱地改水浇地；（四）多种高产作物，特别是大种红苕、洋芋、芋头、萝卜等高产作物。
    省委认为，当前作好工作的重要关键是进一步改进领导作风和广大干部的作风，充分发扬敢想敢干与实事求是相结合的科学精神。省委号召一切干部都必须养成实事求是、艰苦奋斗、深入细致、踏踏实实的思想和工作作风。
    省委的决定和号召正在迅速变成湖北省广大干部和群众的实际行动，成千上万的干部带着行李深入生产第一线，到最艰苦的地方去，到落后地区去。由中共湖北省委书记处书记、省长张体学率领的省直农业检查团，于14日、15日两天出发到武汉地区各县进行工作。很多公社机关都把办公室搬到了生产小队安家落户。一切能够抽出的劳动力正在向农业战线集中。
    本报南京21日电　中共江苏省委要求各级党委加强对社会主义革命和建设的领导，用更大力量加速发展农业，踏踏实实地抓思想作风、抓工农业生产、抓人民生活。这个要求是在最近召开的地、市、县委第一书记会议上提出来的。
    会议期间，省委第一书记江渭清作了两次报告。会议一致认为，今年上半年的江苏省的各项工作，取得了巨大成绩，实现了持续大跃进。在农业方面，全省四千多万亩夏熟作物，除了少数地区因灾减产或者增产不多外，绝大部分地区获得了大丰收。工业支援农业、城市支援农村，比过去做得更加有领导、有计划、有组织。工业生产、基本建设和交通运输业也有了很大的发展。
    会议着重讨论了国民经济以农业为基础的方针，和用更大力量来加速发展农业的问题。会议认为，要进一步搞好农业，一定要切实解决农村劳动力的问题。在劳动力的安排方面，要坚决贯彻以农业为主、以粮食生产为主、以当前生产为主的方针，经常保证以极大多数的劳动力用之于农业。在今后一个时期，发展工业应该贯彻增产不增人、增产还要减人的原则。为了全面地、有效地解决农村劳动力问题，必须做到六个字，这就是：“保”，保护劳动力，爱护劳动力；“改”，大搞工具改革，大搞农业技术改造，以减轻劳动强度，节省劳动力；提高劳动生产率；“排”，由各级党委来统一安排劳动力；“管”，统一管理劳动力；“挤”，各行各业挤出多余的劳动力支援农业，加强农业；“训”，训练劳动后备，训练技术人材。会议对于全省要狠抓粮、棉、油、副食品这四个重点，也作了讨论。
    会议指出，当前各条战线上的形势，十分良好。在今后工作中，各级干部一定要把冲天干劲与科学分析紧密结合起来，把敢想敢说敢做与实事求是紧密结合起来，把高瞻远瞩和狠抓当前紧密结合起来。会议号召全省人民在农业方面进一步开展“苏北鼓劲赶江南、江南更上一层楼”的群众运动，在工业方面进一步开展“东学上海，西赶南京”的革命竞赛，实现更好更全面跃进！
