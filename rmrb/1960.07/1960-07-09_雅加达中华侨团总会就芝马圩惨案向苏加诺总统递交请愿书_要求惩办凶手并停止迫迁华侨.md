Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 7th: The Jakarta Chinese Community Organizations today sent a delegation headed by Song Zhongquan, acting president of the organization, to the Presidential Palace to submit a petition to President Sukarno regarding the tragic killing of overseas Chinese women in Tjimahi.

Presidential Secretary Brodjoningrat received the delegation. He said that he would immediately hand the petition over to President Sukarno.

The full text of the petition is as follows:

The Jakarta Chinese Community Organizations, representing all overseas Chinese in Jakarta, and with immense grief and indignation, send a delegation to state the following to President Sukarno: Under the influence of Presidential Decree No. 10, especially since the authorities in West Java began forcibly relocating overseas Chinese, the vast majority of overseas Chinese have lost their livelihoods and become displaced persons. What is even more unfortunate is that the West Java authorities have not only failed to abide by the guarantee made by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio in his reply to Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi regarding the cessation of the forced relocation of overseas Chinese, but have instead intensified the forced relocations. During the second forced relocation of overseas Chinese, they even used force. On July 3rd, they killed unarmed and innocent overseas Chinese women, Yang Mumei, who was four months pregnant, and Ye Jinniang, and injured overseas Chinese female students Lin Pinying and Wu Zhiwen, thus causing a bloody incident. The vast majority of overseas Chinese are extremely shocked and indignant about this incident.

In order to protect the lives, property, and legitimate rights and interests of the vast majority of overseas Chinese, we request that President Sukarno, based on the Five Principles of Nation Building, humanitarianism, and the friendship between China and Indonesia, punish the murderers, provide compensation to the families of the deceased, compensate the victims for their losses, stop the forced relocation and other persecutory activities, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    雅加达中华侨团总会就芝马圩惨案向苏加诺总统递交请愿书
    要求惩办凶手并停止迫迁华侨
    新华社雅加达7日电　雅加达中华侨团总会今天派以该会代理会长宋中铨为首的代表团前往总统府，就芝马圩华侨妇女惨遭杀害的事件向苏加诺总统递交请愿书。
    总统秘书布罗迪宁接见了代表团。他说，他将立即把请愿书交给苏加诺总统。
    请愿书全文如下：
    雅加达中华侨团总会代表雅加达全体华侨，并以无比悲愤的心情派遣代表团向苏加诺总统阁下申述如下：在第十号总统法令的影响下，特别是自从西爪哇当局对华侨进行迫迁以来，广大华侨群众失去了生计，变成流离失所的人。更加不幸的是，西爪哇当局不仅没有遵守印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约先生在致中国外交部长陈毅元帅的复信中所作的关于不再对华侨进行迫迁的保证，反而加紧进行迫迁。在第二次对华侨进行迫迁的过程中，他们竟然使用武力。7月3日，他们打死手无寸铁的无辜的华侨妇女、怀孕四个月的杨木妹和叶金娘，打伤华侨女学生林品英和吴志文，从而造成流血事件。广大华侨群众对于这一事件极为震惊并万分愤慨。
    为了保障广大华侨的生命财产和正当权益，我们要求苏加诺总统阁下从建国五基，人道主义和中国、印度尼西亚友谊出发，惩办凶手，抚恤死者家属，赔偿受害人的损失，停止迫迁和其它迫害活动，防止再次发生类似事件。
