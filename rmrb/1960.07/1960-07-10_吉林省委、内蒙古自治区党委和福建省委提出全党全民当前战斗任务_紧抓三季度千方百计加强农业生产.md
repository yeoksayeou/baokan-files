Jilin
(Our reporter from Changchun, July 9th) Vigorously promoting agricultural production and pushing the summer hoeing campaign to a new high tide – this is the combat task proposed by the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee.
　　Since the beginning of this year, the situation on Jilin Province's agricultural front has been very good. Great achievements have been made in spring plowing and sowing. At present, the province has successfully completed rice transplanting; the first hoeing of early fields has been completed; and the second hoeing has also completed about half. More than 180,000 cadres at all six levels throughout the province are working in the fields with the commune members, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses. They are working, learning, discussing, and evaluating in the fields. The command posts and staff departments are scattered in the fields. The more deeply the cadres go into the front lines, the more meticulous, down-to-earth, and energetic they become. At the same time, large numbers of people from all walks of life, including industry, commerce, education, and the military, are supporting agriculture. Communes are doing everything possible to tap their potential, bringing the labor force on the summer hoeing front lines to the total number of rural laborers in normal times. During this period, the province's livestock production has also increased.
　　In light of the overall situation in Jilin Province, the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee determined that the province's future task is: first, to vigorously develop agricultural production and strive for a continued bumper harvest this year; and to use agriculture as the center, and on the basis of achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture, to promote a comprehensive leap forward in industrial production and other work.
　　To this end, the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee decided to vigorously promote agricultural production in the current work and push the national summer hoeing campaign to a new peak. The troops supporting agriculture in various places, except for school teachers and students who can return to school to study after their labor period expires in accordance with national regulations, the personnel participating in field labor from other units should continue to work until the end of July, after which they will return to their original units. During the summer hoeing period, it is also necessary to combine drainage and waterlogging prevention with replanting buckwheat, cabbage, radish, and other late autumn crops, and to expand the planting area as much as possible. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen flood control and waterlogging prevention work, ensuring that all large, medium, and small reservoirs and major river embankments in the province are guarded by people, and that every reservoir has someone responsible, so as to effectively carry out flood control work. Second, it is necessary to seize the time to accumulate fertilizer and make fertilizer, especially to immediately strengthen preparations for topdressing autumn fields. Third, it is necessary to seize the time to prepare for autumn harvest and autumn plowing, mainly the preparation of tools. Fourth, it is necessary to promote the mature advanced experience in the technological revolution. According to seasonal and local characteristics, emphasis should be placed on promoting advanced experience in summer hoeing, autumn harvesting, and autumn plowing. Fifth, it is necessary to properly solve the problem of agricultural labor force arrangement: the basic principle of current labor force arrangement is that during the busy season of summer hoeing, all departments should stop transferring labor from rural areas. A part can be transferred during the slack season, but it must be approved by the leadership and not be over-transferred. As for the basic arrangement of rural labor force, relevant departments should conduct investigations and research to determine the basic proportion of labor force used for various undertakings of the rural people's communes, so as to ensure that the vast majority of the labor force is used for agricultural production.
　　While focusing on discussing agriculture, this meeting also discussed the current industrial production, capital construction, especially basic industries (steel, machinery, etc.) and the province's production and construction planning layout; as well as arranging the people's economic life and other important work.

Inner Mongolia
(Our reporter from Hohhot, July 9th) Thoroughly implement "taking agriculture as the center and comprehensively arranging work," and do everything possible to overcome difficulties and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural and livestock production – this is the fighting call made by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, held from June 24 to July 2, to the Party committees at all levels in the Autonomous Region.
　　The Inner Mongolia Party Committee believes that under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and through the hard work of cadres at all levels and farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, the Autonomous Region has achieved a situation of continuous and sustained leap forward for two consecutive years. This year, agricultural spring plowing and sowing has been carried out earlier, faster, more, and better, with a planting area increased by more than 10 million mu compared to last year; in livestock production, 9.18 million young animals have been delivered, with 8.12 million surviving. In industry, many enterprises have completed their semi-annual plans ahead of schedule, and major products such as steel, iron, steel materials, coal, and timber have all seen significant growth. Industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry present a scene of great prosperity.
　　The meeting believes that vigorously developing agricultural and livestock production is the central link in the Autonomous Region's national economic construction. The current urgent task is to do everything possible to do a good job in summer hoeing field management and to launch a struggle against natural disasters. First, it is necessary to rationally arrange the labor force, drawing out the labor force on reservoirs that cannot be dammed before the flood season, so that 75%-80% of the rural labor force is concentrated on summer hoeing field management. Second, it is necessary to implement the policy of multiple planting and multiple harvests, and high-yield and multiple harvests, and to plant a large number of millet, buckwheat, and other small-day and late-autumn crops, and launch a fall vegetable planting campaign. Third, it is necessary to earnestly grasp water and fertilizer measures. Water conservancy construction must first focus on the existing engineering facilities; for incomplete drainage and irrigation machinery, the machinery department should do everything possible to quickly complete them. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over animal husbandry, and must take "100 mothers and 100 offspring" and "safe herds" as the guiding principles, and seize the favorable opportunity of July, August, and September to launch a mass movement for a good start to the next year throughout the region.
　　The meeting believes that to ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural and livestock production this year, all walks of life must also vigorously support it. First, the entire industrial front must immediately launch a large-scale mass movement to support agricultural and livestock production, with leagues and cities as units, specifically organizing factory-commune hookups. Each industrial transportation enterprise should hook up with one or two or more communes, and provide support in terms of helping with agricultural and livestock production materials, arming the people's commune industry, and helping to train technical forces. Commercial departments should supply production materials to the masses in a timely manner.
　　The meeting also focused on discussing strengthening the strength of grassroots organizations and strengthening the leadership work on the front lines of production. In addition to requiring grassroots leading cadres of all enterprises in industry to resolutely implement the "two-five system" working method, management agencies above the league and city levels should spend at least half of their time and personnel regularly going deep into enterprises to help solve problems and strengthen the specific organization of production. For people's communes in rural and pastoral areas that have not yet been equipped with flag and county party committee members or above to serve as the first secretary, a cadre at the level of flag and county party committee secretary, standing committee member, or committee member must be immediately equipped to serve as or concurrently serve as the first secretary. People's communes that are relatively backward or far away from the flag and county party committee's location must have the first secretary or standing committee member of the flag and county party committee serve as the first secretary. All leagues, cities, and directly affiliated agencies of flags and counties in the Autonomous Region should take measures to tighten up institutions and streamline personnel, and draw out a portion of cadres to strengthen the work on the front lines.

Fujian
(Our reporter from Fuzhou, July 9th) The Fujian Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged meeting from June 25 to 30. The meeting required the entire party and people to concentrate their efforts on vigorously promoting agriculture, overcoming the various difficulties brought about by typhoon and flood disasters, and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year to achieve a continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
　　The meeting, after summarizing the experience since the Great Leap Forward and analyzing the current excellent situation, deployed future work tasks. After achieving two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, Fujian Province has achieved tremendous achievements in all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, culture and education, and health in the first half of this year. The situation is unprecedentedly good, and the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses are unprecedentedly high. However, the strong typhoon and unprecedented severe floods in June have brought great difficulties to this year's agricultural production increase. Therefore, the primary task of the province is to concentrate efforts on grasping agriculture.
　　The meeting pointed out that July, August, and September are the key periods for Fujian to seize a sustained leap forward in agriculture this year. All parts of the province must devote the greatest effort to grasp agricultural production tightly and thoroughly, grasping summer and autumn simultaneously; grasping planting and management simultaneously; grasping expansion of planting and high yields simultaneously, and conscientiously doing a good job in summer harvest and summer planting and doing a good job in field management, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. The meeting emphasized: In grasping agricultural production, the labor force used for agricultural production in various places must be resolutely guaranteed to be above 80% during the busy farming season, and in general, more than 50% of the labor force must be used for field management.
　　In order to concentrate efforts on grasping agriculture, the meeting also required industrial departments in various places to immediately launch a large-scale mass movement of industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting rural areas. All factories must take the initiative to hook up with communes and institutionalize, regularize, and universalize the system of supporting agriculture. At present, it is necessary to vigorously grasp the production of new and improved agricultural tools, mainly rice transplanters, harvesters, and threshers, to vigorously grasp rural hydropower equipment, drainage and irrigation equipment, agricultural product processing tools, transportation tools, and pesticide production, and to vigorously develop fertilizer production to support summer harvest and summer planting, and to support agricultural production.
　　The meeting pointed out: Putting politics in command and revolutionary vigor will always be the fundamental guarantee for our production leap forward. At the same time, we must also pay great attention to grasping the lives of the masses. Party committees at all levels must have a secretary to manage canteens and grasp life, and must send selfless and capable party and league member cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants' activists to run canteens, to be responsible for mastering life and welfare undertakings, all cadres working in rural areas must eat in the canteens, and run the canteens well.
　　The meeting finally pointed out: The current situation is very good, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Party committees at all levels must earnestly and deeply conduct ideological education for cadres, repeatedly publicizing the significance of agriculture as the foundation, so that cadres at all levels can more consciously grasp agriculture; at the same time, various places should further promote the "two-five" system, led by the first secretary, organize the vast majority of cadres in the agency to go to the grassroots level, to the front lines of production, carry forward the excellent style of the land reform team during the democratic revolution, and eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses, and earnestly do the work well; resolutely streamline meetings, resolutely do not hold meetings that should not be held, and resolutely do not hold meetings that may or may not be held, and postpone meetings that can be postponed, so as to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in production in these three months.

    吉林省委、内蒙古自治区党委和福建省委提出全党全民当前战斗任务
    紧抓三季度千方百计加强农业生产
    立即开展各行各业支援农业的群众运动，保证农业生产有足够的人力物力
    坚决执行干部参加生产领导生产的制度，切实改进领导作风，充实基层组织
    吉林
    本报长春9日电　大抓农业生产，把夏锄推向新高潮，这是中共吉林省委常委扩大会议提出的战斗任务。
    今年以来，吉林省农业战线的形势很好。春耕播种已取得很大成绩。目前，全省水田插秧胜利结束；早田铲趟完成头遍；二遍铲趟也完成一半左右。全省六级干部十八万多人与社员会战田间，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。田间办公，田间学习，田间讨论，田间评比；指挥部、参谋部，散布田间。干部深入第一线越干越细，越干越踏实，越干越劲大。与此同时全省工、商、学、兵等各行各业大批人员支援农业，各公社千方百计挖掘潜力，使夏锄第一线的劳力达到平时农村劳动力的总数。这一期间，全省畜牧生产也有所增长。
    针对吉林省全面情况，省委常委扩大会议确定全省今后任务是：首先要大力发展农业生产，争取今年农业继续丰收；并且以农业为中心，在取得农业丰收的基础上，促使工业生产及其他各项工作全面跃进。
    为此，省委常委扩大会议在当前工作中，决定大力搞好农业生产，把全民夏锄运动推向新高峰。各地支援农业大军，除学校师生按照国家规定，劳动期满后可回校学习外，其余各单位参加田间劳动的人员，要继续到7月底挂锄以后，再回到原单位工作。夏锄期间，还要结合排涝，抢种荞麦、白菜、萝卜等晚秋作物，尽量扩大种植面积。同时，要加强防汛防涝工作，做到全省大、中、小水库工程和主要江河堤段处处有人防守，库库有人负责，把防汛工作切实做好。其次是抓紧积肥造肥工作，特别对当前秋田追肥，要立即加强准备。第三，抓紧秋收和秋翻地准备工作，其中主要是工具准备工作。第四，推广技术革命中成熟的先进经验。根据季节性与本地特点，着重推广夏锄、秋收与秋翻地的先进经验。第五，妥善解决农业劳动力的安排问题：当前劳动力安排的基本原则，在夏锄繁忙季节，停止一切部门从农村抽调劳动力，农闲时可抽调一部分，但也必须经过领导批准，不能多抽。至于农村劳动力基本安排，有关部门应进行调查研究，确定农村人民公社各项事业所用劳动力的基本比例，保证绝大多数劳动力用于农业生产。
    这次会议在着重讨论农业的同时，还讨论了当前工业生产，基本建设，特别是基础工业（钢铁、机械等）和全省生产建设的规划布局；以及安排人民经济生活和其他重要工作。
    内蒙古
    本报呼和浩特9日电　贯彻执行“以农业为中心、全面安排工作”，千方百计克服困难争取农牧业生产大丰收，这是6月24日到7月2日内蒙古党委举行的常委扩大会议向自治区各级党委提出的战斗号召。
    内蒙古党委认为自治区在党中央和毛主席的指导下经过各级干部与各族农牧民的艰苦努力，已经获得了连续两年持续跃进的局面。今年在农业上春耕播种进行得又早、又快、又多、又好，播种面积比去年增加一千多万亩；畜牧业生产，已接产仔畜九百一十八万头，成活八百一十二万头。在工业上很多企业提前完成了上半年计划，钢、铁、钢材、煤炭、木材等主要产品都有大幅度增长，工农牧业呈现出一派大好形势。
    会议认为大力发展农牧业生产，是当前自治区国民经济建设的中心环节。目前的紧迫任务就是千方百计地搞好夏锄田间管理和展开抗御自然灾害的斗争。首先，要合理安排劳动力，把汛前不能截流的水库上的劳动力抽出来，务使农村75％—80％的劳动力集中到夏锄田间管理上来。其次，要贯彻多种多收和高产多收方针，大量种植糜黍、荞麦等小日月晚秋作物，并开展一个种秋菜运动。再次，是认真抓紧水、肥措施，水利建设必须先抓现有工程配套，没有配成套的排灌机械，机械部门应该千方百计地迅速配成套。同时，加强对畜牧业的领导，必须以“百母百仔”和“安全群”为纲，紧紧抓住7、8、9月有利时机，在全区范围内开展一个群众性的下一年度的开门红运动。
    会议认为，要确保今年农牧业丰产丰收，各行各业还必须大力支援。首先在整个工业战线上要立即掀起一个大规模的支援农牧业生产的群众运动，以盟市为单位，具体组织厂社挂钩，每个工业交通企业都应和一个公社或两个以上公社挂钩，从帮助农牧业生产资料，武装人民公社工业，帮助培训技术力量等方面进行支援工作。商业部门要把生产资料及时地供应到群众手里。
    会议还着重对充实基层组织力量，加强生产第一线的领导工作作了讨论。除在工业上要求各企业基层领导干部坚决推行“二五制”的工作方法外，盟市以上各级企业管理机关，起码要有二分之一的时间和人员，经常深入企业帮助解决问题，加强生产的具体组织工作。在农村牧区人民公社尚未配备旗县委委员以上干部担任第一书记者，必须立即配备一名旗县委书记、常委或委员级的干部来担任或兼任第一书记。凡是比较落后或距离旗县委所在地遥远的人民公社，必须由旗县委第一书记或常委担任第一书记。自治区各盟市和旗县直属机关，都应采取紧缩机构、精简人员的办法，抽出一部分干部，加强第一线的工作。
    福建
    本报福州9日电　中共福建省委在6月25日到30日召开了扩大会议，会议要求当前全党全民集中力量大抓农业，克服因台风和洪水灾害而带来的种种困难，争取今年农业大丰收，实现工农业生产的继续跃进。
    会议在总结了大跃进以来的经验、分析当前大好形势的基础上，部署了今后的工作任务。福建省在取得连续两年大跃进之后，今年上半年全省工业、农业、商业、文化教育和卫生等各方面工作，又取得了巨大成绩，形势空前良好，广大群众的政治热情和生产积极性空前高涨。但是6月上旬遭受强台风和百年来未有的特大洪水袭击，已给今年农业增产带来了很大困难，因此，当前全省的首要任务是集中力量抓好农业。
    会议指出：7、8、9三个月是福建夺取今年农业持续跃进的关键时期。全省各地一定要拿出最大的力量，把农业生产抓紧、抓到底，一手抓夏、一手抓秋；一手抓种、一手抓管；一手抓扩种、一手抓高产，扎扎实实地把夏收夏种搞好，把田间管理搞好，力争今年农业大丰收。会议强调指出：在抓农业生产中，各地用于农业生产的劳力在农忙季节坚决保证在80％以上，一般情况下也要有50％以上的劳力用于田间管理。
    为了集中力量抓好农业，会议还要求各地工业部门立即开展一个工业支援农业、城市支援农村的大规模群众运动，各工厂要主动和公社挂钩，并把支援农业制度化、经常化、普遍化。当前要大抓以插秧机、收割机、打谷机为主的新式改良农具的生产，要大抓农村水力水电设备、排灌设备、农产品加工工具、运输工具和农药生产，还要大力发展化肥生产，支援夏收夏种，支援农业生产。
    会议指出：政治挂帅，革命干劲，永远是我们生产大跃进的根本保证。同时，还必须十分重视抓好群众的生活。各级党委都要有一个书记来管食堂抓生活，都要派大公无私有能力的党团员干部、贫农下中农积极分子去办食堂，去负责掌握生活福利事业，所有在农村工作的干部都要在食堂吃饭，并办好食堂。
    会议最后指出：现在形势很好，群众干劲很足，各级党委就要认真的、深入的对干部进行思想教育，反复宣传以农业为基础的意义，使各级干部更自觉地抓好农业；同时，各地应进一步推广“二五”制，由第一书记挂帅，组织机关的绝大多数的干部到基层去，到生产第一线去，发扬民主革命时期土改队的优良作风，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，切切实实把工作作好；坚决精简会议，不该开的坚决不开，可开可不开的会也坚决不开，能推迟的会就推迟，以集中力量搞好这三个月的生产。（附图片）
