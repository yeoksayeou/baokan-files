Xinhua News Agency, June 30th -- A spokesperson for the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued the following statement regarding the news of the incident on the China-Nepal border:

    According to reports from foreign news agencies on June 29th, an incident occurred on the China-Nepal border on June 28th in which Chinese troops killed and captured personnel from the Nepalese side. The Chinese government is deeply surprised and extremely concerned about this news. The Chinese government has immediately instructed relevant departments to ascertain the truth of the matter.

    Prior to this, the Chinese government had, on June 26th, through our Ambassador to India concurrently accredited to Nepal, Pan Zili, and the Foreign Affairs Office of Tibet, respectively notified the Nepalese Ambassador to India concurrently accredited to China, Lieutenant General Rana, and the Nepalese Consul-General in Lhasa, Basnyat, as follows: "A group of insurgents are carrying out harassment in our territory near the China-Nepal border. This not only affects local public security but also hinders the implementation of the agreement between China and Nepal on border issues. In order to ensure the tranquility of the border between the two countries and to prevent the friendly relations between China and Nepal from being affected, we have decided to send troops to suppress them. During the suppression, our troops will strictly limit their actions within our territory and will never cross the border. If the insurgents flee into Nepalese territory, we will not pursue them across the border. After the suppression is completed, our suppression troops will immediately withdraw from the area 20 kilometers from our side of the border. Within this area, we will strictly abide by the provisions of the China-Nepal border agreement, neither stationing troops nor sending armed personnel to patrol." The Nepalese government announced on June 28th that it had received the above-mentioned notification from the Chinese government.

    After learning about the news of the accidental incident on the China-Nepal border, the Chinese government immediately telegraphed our Ambassador to India concurrently accredited to Nepal, Pan Zili, and the Foreign Affairs Office of Tibet at 4:00 AM on June 30th to express to the Nepalese Ambassador to India concurrently accredited to China, Lieutenant General Rana, and the Nepalese Consul-General in Lhasa, Basnyat, that our government is extremely concerned about this news and has immediately investigated the truth of the matter locally, and will notify the Nepalese government immediately upon receiving a response.

    At 10:00 AM on June 30th, Premier Zhou Enlai received a letter from Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala through Ambassador Pan Zili forwarded by Nepalese Foreign Affairs Secretary Thapa. In the letter, Prime Minister Koirala protested against the killing and capture of Nepalese personnel by Chinese troops on the China-Nepal border, and demanded the immediate release of the captured Nepalese personnel, etc. Premier Zhou Enlai replied to Prime Minister Koirala on the same day at 9:00 PM, explaining that our government is extremely concerned about this news and is investigating the truth of the matter locally, and stated that if the unfortunate incident of Nepalese people being killed as mentioned in the Nepalese Prime Minister's letter is true, the Chinese government will express its deep regret; if Nepalese people have indeed been detained, they will be released promptly.

    China and Nepal have traditional friendship. In recent years, through mutual visits by the Prime Ministers and Premiers of the two countries and the signing of the China-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the China-Nepal Border Agreement, the friendly relations between the two countries have entered a new stage. The Chinese government believes that this accidental incident on the China-Nepal border will be properly resolved based on the facts and in the spirit of friendship between the two countries after the truth of the incident is ascertained. The schemes of imperialism and foreign reactionaries to slander and provoke China-Nepal relations and to stir up another anti-China movement by taking advantage of this incident are doomed to fail.

    我外交部新闻司发言人
    就中尼边境事件消息发表声明
    这次意外事件在查明真相后定会本着友好精神妥善解决
    帝国主义和外国反动派的诬蔑、挑拨阴谋一定不能得逞
    新华社30日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人今天就中尼边境发生事件的消息发表声明如下：
    据外国通讯社6月29日的报道，6月28日在中尼边境发生了中国军队打死和俘掳尼泊尔方面人员的事件。中国政府对于这个消息深感意外，并且极为关注。中国政府已经立即指示有关方面查明事实真相。
    在此以前，中国政府曾经在6月26日通过我国驻印度兼驻尼泊尔大使潘自力和西藏外事处，分别向尼泊尔驻印度兼驻中国大使拉纳中将和尼泊尔驻拉萨总领事巴斯尼亚特作以下的通知：“有一部分叛匪在靠近中尼边界的我方地区进行骚扰，这不但影响了当地的治安，而且也妨碍中尼两国关于边界问题协定的执行。为了确保两国边境的安宁，为了中尼友好关系不致因而受到影响，我们决定派部队前往进剿。在进剿过程中，我军将严格限制在我国境内行动，决不越出国境，如叛匪窜入尼境，我方也不越界追击。进剿结束后，我进剿部队将立即撤离边界本侧二十公里的地区。在此地区内，我方将严守中尼边界协定的规定，既不驻军，也不派武装人员进行巡逻。”尼泊尔政府在6月28日宣布，它已经得到了中国政府的上述通知。
    中国政府在获悉关于中尼边境发生意外事件的消息后，即于30日晨四时电令我国驻印度兼驻尼泊尔大使潘自力和西藏外事处分别向尼泊尔驻印度兼驻中国大使拉纳中将和尼泊尔驻拉萨总领事巴斯尼亚特表示：我国政府对此消息极为关注，并且已经立即向当地查明这件事情的真相，有回报后当立即通知尼泊尔政府。
    6月30日十时，周恩来总理接到尼泊尔政府外事秘书塔帕经过潘自力大使转来的尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊的信。在信中，柯伊拉腊首相就中国军队在中尼边境打死和俘掳尼泊尔人员一事提出抗议，并且要求立即释放被俘的尼泊尔人员等。周恩来总理在当天二十一时复信柯伊拉腊首相，说明我国政府对此消息极为关注，正在向当地调查这件事情的真相，并且表示，如果尼泊尔首相来信中所说尼泊尔人被打死的不幸的事属实，中国政府将表示非常遗憾；如果确有尼泊尔人被扣留，自当迅速释放。
    中尼两国有着传统的友谊。今年来，通过两国总理和首相的相互访问以及中尼和平友好条约和中尼边界协定的签订，两国的友好关系更进入了一个新的阶段。中国政府相信，这次中尼边境上发生的意外事件，在查明事件真相后，定会根据事实，本着两国友好的精神，妥善地加以解决。帝国主义和外国反动派借此次事件进行诬蔑、挑拨中尼关系、再次煽起反华运动的阴谋，是一定不能得逞的。
