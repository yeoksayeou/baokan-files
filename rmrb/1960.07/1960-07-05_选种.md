    Seed Selection
    Liu Zhang, Banbishan Commune, Xinglong, Hebei
    Wave upon wave of wheat ripples, tractor sounds sing out.
    The secretary, captain, and commune leader are busy selecting seeds in the wheat fields.
    The rest bell rings out across the mountains, commune members discuss experiences in the fields.
    Each experience is recorded in the notebook, each word and line radiating golden light.
    The commune members surround the secretary, excitedly telling their stories:
    "Look at the secretary's writing, next year's bumper harvest is already written down."
