Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, July 17th: The ship "Da Baokang," which is transporting overseas Chinese, returned to Zhanjiang Port on the afternoon of the 15th after its seventh voyage from Indonesia to pick up a group of overseas Chinese.

These overseas Chinese came from Belitung, the vast majority of whom were tin miners, with a few carpenters and small vendors. They expressed extreme anger at the atrocities committed by the West Java military authorities in massacring overseas Chinese women in the days before they left Indonesia. After arriving in the territorial waters of the motherland on the 15th, they held a gathering on the ship and unanimously supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of protest to the Indonesian government.

This group of returned overseas Chinese received a warm reception in Zhanjiang. They will rest in Zhanjiang for a few days before going to Yunnan Province to settle down.

On the morning of the 16th, the "Da Baokang" set sail again from Zhanjiang for its eighth voyage to Indonesia to pick up overseas Chinese returning home.

A group of unemployed miners, unemployed small vendors, and impoverished overseas Chinese from Belitung boarded the "Da Baokang" ship on the 9th to return home. Belitung is a famous mining center in Indonesia. Thousands of overseas Chinese mine mineral deposits there.
