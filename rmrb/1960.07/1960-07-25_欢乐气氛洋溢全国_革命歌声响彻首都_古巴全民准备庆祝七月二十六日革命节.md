Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd - On the highways and railways leading to Oriente Province in Cuba, a constant stream of cars, trucks, and trains are carrying tens of thousands of workers, students, and militiamen to the Sierra Maestra mountains. These people from all over Cuba will join the local farmers in a massive people's rally scheduled for July 26th to protest the aggression of U.S. imperialism against their homeland and reaffirm their unwavering determination to defend the Cuban Revolution and defeat foreign invaders.

    The Cuban Ministry of Labor has decided to grant workers three days of holiday so that they can participate in this conference to be held in the Sierra Maestra mountains.

    Havana is filled with a joyful atmosphere of celebrating the Revolution Day. Many buildings are hung with Cuban flags; vehicles are plastered with slogans such as "Long Live Free Cuba" and "Down with U.S. Imperialism." Travelers heading to the revolutionary base, riding in vehicles, shout slogans such as "Cuba Yes, Yankees No," "Swear to Defend the Motherland," and "We Shall Win" as they pass through the city. The residents of Havana sing revolutionary songs and cheer them along the way.

    Sugar workers from Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba began traveling to Oriente Province today in five hundred trucks. Along the way, people from other provinces will gradually join their ranks.

    Havana newspapers reported the warm welcome that the residents of Oriente Province are preparing for their brothers and sisters from all over the country. Local residents have already posted slogans on buildings to pay tribute to those attending the July 26th commemoration meeting, reading: "Visiting brothers, this is your home." Various people's organizations have prepared accommodation and food for the visitors. A female worker named Velasquez from a café said: "In my house, we will receive as many people as we can accommodate." An old lady named Rosa Velasquez said: "I have never seen our city show such high enthusiasm. We want to let people know that all of us support the revolution."

    Cooperatives across the country have donated food to the people traveling to the Sierra Maestra mountains; a donation campaign has also been launched across the country to cover their expenses. On the eve of the revolutionary festival, the Cuban people are uniting more closely to stage a powerful demonstration against the U.S. imperialists who are eyeing their homeland.

    哈瓦那充满庆祝革命节日的欢乐气氛。许多建筑物上悬挂着古巴国旗；车辆上贴着“自由古巴万岁”、
  “打倒美帝国主义”的标语。前往革命根据地的旅客乘着车辆，高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”、“誓死保卫祖国”、“我们必胜”的口号驰过闹市。哈瓦那的居民唱着革命歌曲，沿途欢送他们。
