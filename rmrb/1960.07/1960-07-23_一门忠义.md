    “A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness”
    Lin Xu
    On July 19th, the fourth page of the People's Daily featured a vivid report about Liu Suojin, the production team leader of Jianmeng Brigade, Shangxing Commune, Liyang County, Jiangsu, and his exemplary story of "a completely red family."
    Liu Suojin's family is a revolutionary family, a family dedicated to socialist construction. All six of his siblings are resolute and thorough revolutionaries, practical and progressive individuals. The entire family is wholeheartedly devoted to the collective, with no selfish desires. They take the lead in all tasks, charging ahead in the cause of the Party, withstanding storms and overcoming difficulties. The minds and bodies of his family are completely integrated with the proletarian revolutionary cause. People praise Liu Suojin's family, saying they are truly "a family of loyalty and righteousness."
    Seeing the Liu family's "loyalty and righteousness" reminds one of many stories about loyalty and righteousness in Chinese history.
    The Northern Song Dynasty produced the "Generals of the Yang Family," who are still praised today. Four generations of the Yang family, men and women, young and old, dedicated themselves to defending the motherland and resisting foreign invasions. From Yang Jiye to Yang Wenguang, most of them were brave, loyal, and unyielding national heroes. However, the Yang family's "loyalty and righteousness" was merely "loyalty to the emperor and righteousness to friends." Old General Ling committing suicide at the Li Ling Stele and Yang Dalang sacrificing himself for the emperor are all manifestations of this kind of loyalty to the emperor. Historically, a step further from this "family of loyalty and righteousness" are the heroes of Liangshan from *Water Margin*.
    The 108 heroes of Liangshan gathered in righteousness, raising the banner of "Acting on Behalf of Heaven" in front of the "Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness," vowing to overthrow the Song Dynasty imperial family. Broadly speaking, the Liangshan stronghold can also be called "a family of loyalty and righteousness." Among them, Li Kui is perhaps the most prominent. Li Kui is a raging fire of hatred and resistance, a whirlwind sweeping away domination and oppression. He is the bravest and most resolute hero in any struggle, hating the enemy to the bone, never compromising or wavering. Li Kui's strong character is most prominently expressed in his attitude towards the amnesty. Li Kui has infinite love for his elder brother Song Jiang, and always executes Song Jiang's orders unconditionally. However, Li Kui obeys Song Jiang who "still wants to be an enemy with the Emperor of Song." When Song Jiang expressed his desire to compromise with the rulers, Li Kui immediately shouted, "Amnesty, amnesty, what kind of amnesty!" and kicked the table over, smashing it to pieces. Li Kui's loyalty and righteousness to the revolutionary cause is precisely the manifestation of the most resolute revolutionary spirit of the working people in Chinese history.
    Today, the "loyalty and righteousness" we advocate is different from the "family of loyalty and righteousness" of the "Generals of the Yang Family," and also different from the "loyalty and righteousness" of any class in history. We advocate the loyalty and righteousness of proletarian revolutionaries, the new loyalty and righteousness of the new era. This loyalty is loyalty to the Party, loyalty to the proletariat, loyalty to the cause of socialism and communism; this righteousness is selflessness, dedication to others, and the revolutionary righteousness of sharing weal and woe and common destiny with the working people forever.
    For a revolutionary, "loyalty and righteousness" is his soul. Without a red heart of loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause, to the cause of communism, without revolutionary righteousness to the working people, one cannot be called a true revolutionary. Revolutionaries all believe in truth. Marxism-Leninism is the truth, we believe in it, safeguard it, and do not allow anyone to distort or harm it in the slightest; the Party's policies are correct, we resolutely implement them, allowing no wavering or compromise. We consciously are loyal to the Party, loyal to Marxism-Leninism, and thus are loyal to our own revolutionary beliefs, loyal to the distant revolutionary ideals. Therefore, we advocate revolutionary "loyalty and righteousness," which is to advocate the revolutionary spirit of believing in truth, adhering to truth, and safeguarding truth, and to advocate the revolutionary style of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and caring for the masses. Liu Suojin and his family are called "a family of loyalty and righteousness" precisely because they are wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, taking the lead in all work, and demonstrating a revolutionary's unwavering revolutionary attitude.
    There are many, many exemplary deeds like the "family of loyalty and righteousness" of Liu Suojin's family in our country. Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary cadres and working people are loyal and unwavering to the Party and to our cause. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, our 650 million heroic people and the heroic cause they are engaged in is the largest scope of "a family of loyalty and righteousness."

### “一门忠义”

    “一门忠义”
    林旭
    7月19日人民日报第四版上，有一篇生动的报道，写的是江苏溧阳县上兴公社建盟大队上街生产队长刘锁金“全家红”的模范事迹。
    刘锁金的一家，是革命的一家，是全心全意搞社会主义建设的一家。他们兄弟姐妹六人，个个都是坚决彻底的革命者，是踏踏实实的促进派。他们全家人一心为集体，胸无半点私。他们样样工作走在前头，做在前头，为党的事业冲锋陷阵，经得起风雨，顶得住困难。他们一家人的身心和无产阶级的革命事业完全融合在一起了。对于刘锁金的一家，人们称赞说，真是“一门忠义”。
    看到刘家的“一门忠义”，使人想起了我国历史上许多关于忠义的故事。
    北宋出了一门“杨家将”，被人们传颂至今。杨家四代男女老幼献身保卫祖国，抵抗外族侵略，从杨继业一直到杨文广，绝大部分都是勇敢忠贞、坚强不屈的民族英雄。然而，杨家的“一门忠义”，不过是“忠于君，义于友”的忠义，那老令公碰死在李陵碑，杨大郎代主丧身，都是这种忠君思想的表现。历史上比这种“一门忠义”更进一步的是《水浒传》里的梁山英雄们。
    梁山泊一百零八个英雄好汉大聚义，他们在“忠义堂”前竖起“替天行道”的大旗，发誓要推翻大宋皇室。广义地说，梁山泊山寨里大体上也称得上是“一门忠义”。其中最突出的，大约要数李逵了。李逵是一团仇恨和反抗的烈火，是一股扫荡统治和压迫的旋风，他在任何一场斗争中都是最勇猛、最坚决的好汉，对于敌人仇恨入骨，从来没有丝毫的妥协和动摇。李逵这种坚强性格最突出地表现在他对于招安的态度上。李逵对于他的老大哥宋江是无限敬爱的，对于宋江的将令从来都是毫无条件地执行，然而李逵服从的乃是“兀自要和大宋皇帝做个对头”的宋江，当宋江表达了自己想同统治者妥协的心情时，李逵立刻大叫道：“招安，招安，招甚乌安！”并且一脚把桌子踢起，摔作粉碎。李逵这种对革命事业的忠义，正是历史上我国劳动人民最坚决的革命精神的表现。
    今天，我们所提倡的“忠义”，既不同于“杨家将”的“一门忠义”，也不同于历史上任何阶级的“忠义”。我们提倡的是无产阶级革命者的忠义，是新时代的新忠义。这种忠，就是忠于党、忠于无产阶级，忠于社会主义和共产主义事业；这种义，就是大公无私，舍己为人，永远和劳动人民同甘苦，共命运的革命大义。
    对于一个革命者来说，“忠义”是他的灵魂。没有对无产阶级革命事业、对共产主义事业的赤胆忠心，没有对劳动人民的革命大义，就称不上是一个真正的革命者。革命者都是相信真理的。马克思列宁主义是真理，我们相信它，维护它，不容许任何人对它有半点的歪曲和损害；我们党的方针政策是正确的，我们坚决贯彻执行，容不得丝毫的动摇和妥协。我们自觉地忠于党，忠于马克思列宁主义，也就忠于自己的革命信念，忠于远大的革命理想。因此，我们提倡革命的“忠义”，就是提倡相信真理、坚持真理、维护真理的革命精神，提倡相信群众、依靠群众、关心群众的革命作风。刘锁金和他的一家之所以被人们称做“一门忠义”，正是因为他们全心全意为党，在任何工作中都是以身作则，表现出了一个革命者的坚定不移的革命态度。
    像刘锁金一家的“一门忠义”的模范事迹，在我们的国家里是很多很多的。千千万万的革命干部和劳动人民，对党、对我们的事业都是忠心耿耿，坚定不移的。在党和毛泽东同志领导下的我国六亿五千万英雄人民和他们从事的英雄事业，就是最大范围内的“一门忠义”。
