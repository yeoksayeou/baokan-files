    The Indian Government Planning Commission announced in an official report published on July 4th that the original targets for important projects in India's Second Five-Year Economic Plan from April 1956 to March 1961, such as steel, coal, grain, cotton, and employment, would not be met.

    The report indicated that the Second Five-Year Plan's steel target was 4.3 million tons, but only 2.6 million tons would be completed. The coal production target for the end of the Second Five-Year Plan was 60 million tons, but the actual output would be 53 million tons. The grain production target for the Second Five-Year Plan was 80.5 million tons, but according to the report, it would only reach 75 million tons. As for cotton production, it might reach 5.4 million bales, while the original target was 6.5 million bales.

    The report admitted that "the increase in employment during the Second Five-Year Plan period was not commensurate with the growth of the labor force." Its employment target was to increase employment outside of agriculture by 8 million, but the actual increase in employment would be approximately 6.5 million.

    The report pointed out that during the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the prices of food and industrial products continued to rise. The wholesale price index was 99.2 in the last year of the First Five-Year Plan (1956), rising to 116.3 this year, and would reach 118.6 by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. This means an increase of almost 20%. Not to mention the increase in retail prices of consumer goods.

    The report stated that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, investment in the private sector would greatly exceed earlier estimates, while investment in the public sector would be cut back from the original target. Instead of the planned 24 billion rupees for the private sector, it had now reached approximately 31 billion rupees, while investment in the public sector would be reduced from the original target of 38 billion rupees to 36 billion rupees. The report also indicated that the private sector, which controls the industries of several of the most important products, had developed particularly rapidly in some areas.

    India's Second Five-Year Plan encountered difficulties in terms of capital and foreign exchange.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, 9.82 billion rupees of foreign aid would be used, accounting for a quarter of the total planned expenditure. In addition to foreign aid, borrowing and increased taxation would be used to solve the difficulties.

    The "Times of India" editorial on the 5th, commenting on this official report of the Planning Commission, pointed out that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, "agriculture has remained almost stagnant. The ranks of the unemployed have expanded. Soaring prices have lowered the living standards of the people." "In fact, the government's own employees are now generally restless."

    The newspaper also stated that the number of unemployed in rural and urban areas was much higher than expected. The "Hindustan Standard" editorial on the 6th pointed out that "in reality, the rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer."

    印度政府计划委员会发表官方报告宣布
    印第二个五年计划钢煤粮棉指标不能完成
    “印度时报”说：五年计划期间农业停滞失业队伍扩大
    “印度斯坦旗报”说：实际上富人更富了，穷人更穷了
    新华社新德里7日电　印度政府计划委员会在7月4日发表的一项官方报告中宣布，从1956年4月到1961年3月的印度第二个五年经济计划中的钢、煤、粮食、棉花以及就业等重要项目的原定指标将不能完成。
    报告表明，第二个五年计划规定钢材指标为四百三十万吨，但是将只能完成二百六十万吨，煤产量到第二个五年计划结束时为五千三百万吨，而指标为六千万吨。第二个五年计划的粮食生产指标为八千零五十万吨，但是根据报告，只可能达到七千五百万吨。至于棉花产量，可能达到五百四十万包，而原定指标为六百五十万包。
    报告承认，“在第二个五年计划期间，就业人数的增加同劳动力的增长是不相符的。”它的就业指标是，在农业以外增加的就业人数为八百万，但是实际就业人数将大约增加六百五十万。
    报告指出，在第二个五年计划的头四年间，粮食和工业品的价格不断上涨。批发物价指数在第一个五年计划最后一年（1956年）为九十九点二，今年上升到一百十六点三，在第二个五年计划结束时将达到一百十八点六。它意味着几乎上涨20％。更不必谈消费品零售价格的上涨。
    报告说，在第二个五年计划期间，私营部分的投资将大大超过早些时候的估计，而公营部分的投资则将从原定指标削减下来。私营部分的投资不是原计划的二百四十亿卢比，现在已达到三百一十亿卢比左右，而公营部分的投资将从原指标的三百八十亿卢比减到三百六十亿卢比。这个报告还表明，控制若干最重要产品的工业的私营部分在某些方面发展特别迅速。
    印度的第二个五年计划遇到了资金和外汇方面的困难。
    在第二个五年计划期间，将使用外援九十八亿二千万卢比，这占全部计划支出的四分之一。除了外援外，还将用借债和增加税收的办法来解决困难。
    “印度时报”5日的社论在评论计划委员会的这个官方报告时指出，在第二个五年计划期间“农业几乎仍然是停滞的。失业队伍已经扩大了。盘旋上升的物价已经降低了人民的生活水平。”“事实上，政府自己的雇员现在普遍动荡不安。”
    这家报纸还说，农村和城市地区的失业人数比预料的多得多。“印度斯坦旗报”6日的社论指出，“在实际上，富人更富了，穷人已经更穷了。”
