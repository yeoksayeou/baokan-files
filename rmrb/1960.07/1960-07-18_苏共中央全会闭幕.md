Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th. TASS, Moscow, July 16th: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on July 13th, closed in Moscow on the 16th.

The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee heard and discussed the report on the implementation of the decisions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the development of industry, transportation, and the application of the latest achievements of science and technology in production, and unanimously adopted a resolution on this issue.

Due to the election of Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the plenary session relieved him of his post as Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.

At Voroshilov's own request, the plenary session relieved him of his post as member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee.

The plenary session heard the report by Kozlov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on the talks between representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in Bucharest, and adopted a corresponding resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 16th: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on the 13th, closed in Moscow on the 16th.

This plenary session heard a report on the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU concerning the development of industry, transportation, and the application of the latest scientific and technological achievements in production, and conducted discussions. At the meetings on the 14th and 15th, a total of twenty-five people spoke in the discussion. Among them were: Kunayev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan; Kirilenko, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee; Academician Ioffe; Tarasov, Chairman of the National Economic Council of Belarus; Chokavaidze, Chairman of the National Economic Council of Georgia; Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; Rashidov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan; Petukhov, Chairman of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR Council of Ministers; Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; and Kosygin, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers. In their speeches, they talked about the achievements of Soviet industry and transportation in implementing the decisions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, as well as the achievements and existing shortcomings of Soviet industry in implementing production automation and mechanization, and in manufacturing new machines.

Kosygin, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, said in his speech on the 15th that the discussion at this plenary session on the development of industry and the application of the latest scientific and technological achievements in the national economy is of particularly great significance for establishing the material and technical basis of communism in the Soviet Union. He said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people are solving tasks that mankind could only dream of before. It used to take many decades to accomplish the tasks we are now solving in seven years. For example, according to statistics from the Central Statistical Bureau, as of January 1, 1960, the total basic funds of Soviet state-owned organizations and cooperative organizations, calculated at current prices, amounted to more than 2.4 trillion rubles. This is the entire accumulation of our country from the founding of the former Russian state to the forty-two years of Soviet power. And in the period from 1960 to 1965, the basic funds of our national economy will be doubled. This means that in the seven-year plan, we will create what the entire history of our country has created. No country in the capitalist world can propose such a task. For example, when the war had just ended, catching up with the United States in steel production was such a distant prospect for us. Now the situation has changed. In 1960, we will produce 65 million tons of steel, in 1961 - 71 million tons, while the United States produced about 85 million tons of steel in 1959. Undoubtedly, we will solve this task and catch up with the United States in the near future.

Kosygin said that the results of the implementation of the first year of the seven-year plan and the recently announced implementation of the first half of the second year of the seven-year plan show that the tasks stipulated in the seven-year plan can not only be completed, but will be greatly overfulfilled in the most important indicators. He pointed out that since the implementation of the seven-year plan began, 3.4 million tons of steel, 2.6 million tons of steel products, 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than 3 million tons of petroleum, more than 4 million tons of iron ore, and a large number of other products have been produced more than the planned targets.

Kosygin pointed out that at present, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and economic organizations should carry out large-scale organizational work in order to further accelerate technological progress, strive to achieve the highest indicators in industry and transportation work, and further stimulate creative initiative and responsibility in the struggle to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. It is necessary to tap all potentials and utilize all the potentials of the Soviet economy.

　　苏共中央全会闭幕
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：7月13日开幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，已于16日在莫斯科闭幕。
    苏共中央这次全体会议听取和讨论了苏共第二十一次代表大会关于发展工业、运输业和在生产中采用科学技术最新成就的决议执行情况的报告，并就这个问题一致通过了决议。
    由于苏共中央主席团委员勃列日涅夫当选为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席，全体会议免去他的苏共中央书记的职务。
    全体会议根据伏罗希洛夫本人的请求，免去他的苏共中央主席团委员的职务。
    全会听取了苏共中央书记科兹洛夫作的关于社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表在布加勒斯特举行的会谈的报告，并通过了相应的决议。
    新华社莫斯科16日电　13日开幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，已于16日在莫斯科闭幕。
    这次全体会议听取了苏共第二十一次代表大会关于发展工业、运输业和在生产中采用科学技术最新成就的决议执行情况的报告，并进行了讨论。在14日和15日会议上，共有二十五个人在讨论中发了言。其中有：哈萨克共产党中央委员会书记库纳耶夫，苏共中央主席团候补委员、斯维德洛夫斯克州党委员会书记基里连科，科学院院士约费，白俄罗斯国民经济委员会主席塔拉索夫，格鲁吉亚国民经济委员会主席乔卡瓦泽，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫，乌兹别克共产党中央委员会书记拉希多夫，苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会主席佩图霍夫，全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申，苏共中央主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席柯西金等人。他们在发言中谈到了苏联工业和运输业在执行苏共第二十一次代表大会决议方面所取得的成就，以及苏联工业在实行生产自动化和机械化方面、在制造新式机器方面的所取得的成就和存在的缺点。
    苏共中央主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席柯西金15日在会上讲话时说，在这次全会上讨论发展工业和在国民经济中采用最新科学技术成就的问题，对于在苏联建立共产主义物质技术基础具有特别重大的意义。他说，苏联共产党和苏联人民正在解决那些以前人类只能梦想的那些任务。从前要实现我们现在七年内解决的任务，就需要很多个十年。例如，根据中央统计局的统计，截至1960年1月1日为止，苏联国营组织和合作社组织的全部基本基金，按目前价格计算达二万四千亿卢布以上。这是从以前的俄国立国起一直经过苏维埃政权四十二年，我国的全部积累。而在1960到1965年这段时间内，就要把我国国民经济的基本基金增加一倍。这意味着我们在七年计划中要创造出我国整个历史上所创造的东西。在资本主义世界中没有哪一个国家能提出这样的任务。又如，战争刚结束的时候，在钢的生产方面赶上美国，对我们来说是一个多么遥远的前景。现在的情况变了。 1960年我们将生产出六千五百万吨钢，1961年——七千一百万吨，而美国在1959年生产了大约八千五百万吨钢。无疑我们将在最近期间解决这个任务并且赶上美国。
    柯西金说，七年计划第一年计划执行结果和最近公布的七年计划第二年上半年计划的执行情况表明，七年计划所规定的任务不仅能完成，而且在最重要的指标方面将大大超额完成。他指出，从七年计划开始实行以来，已经超过控制数字比原定任务多生产了三百四十万吨钢、二百六十万吨钢材、五十亿度电力、三百多万吨石油、四百万吨以上铁矿石以及大量其他产品。
    柯西金指出，目前，苏联共产党、工会、共青团和经济组织应该开展大规模的组织工作，以便在争取进一步加速技术进步、争取在工业和运输业工作中达到最高指标、争取提前完成七年计划的任务方面更高地掀起创造主动性和责任感。必须挖掘一切潜力和利用苏联经济所拥有的一切潜力。
