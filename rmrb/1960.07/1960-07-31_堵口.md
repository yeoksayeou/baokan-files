    Blocking the Breach
    Guo Tiecheng, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Zhujiapu Brigade, had just finished attending a telephone conference convened by the commune's Party committee when a torrential rain began to fall outside. It was the dead of night when suddenly, the sound of gongs signaling an emergency rang out. Guo Tiecheng knew there was a problem with the Jiangdong Canal of the Shima Production Team. Without bothering to put on a raincoat or straw hat, barefoot and bareheaded, he grabbed the iron shovel from the corner of the door and ran outside. As he ran, he shouted and mobilized more than sixty members of the Wangjiawan Production Team to head straight for the Jiangdong Canal.

    When they arrived, the canal's embankment had already been breached by a gap two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) long, and sixty-two mu (approximately 4.1 hectares) of paddy fields and two hundred meters of the canal were about to be destroyed by the flood. Guo Tiecheng examined the flood control equipment. There were only thirty-odd door panels left, and no wooden stakes to secure them for blocking the water. Guo Tiecheng decided to send ten people to chop wooden stakes, while he himself carried a door panel and jumped into the water. Seeing the Party General Branch Secretary's selfless action, more than twenty other members also jumped into the water carrying door panels, forming a dam. After an hour of struggle, the people chopping wooden stakes returned. Everyone hammered in the stakes, carried soil, and blocked the breach, conquering the flood.

    堵口
    朱家铺大队党总支书记郭铁城，刚刚开完公社党委召开的电话会议，外面就下起了倾盆大雨。这时正是深更半夜，忽然传来一阵嘡嘡嘡抢险的锣声。郭铁城知道是石马生产队的江东干渠出了问题，来不及披蓑戴笠，赤脚光头，顺手拿起门角里的铁锹就向外跑。他边跑边喊，动员了王家湾生产队的六十多个社员，直奔江东干渠。
    他们到时，干渠大堤已被水冲出了二丈来长的缺口，眼看六十二亩稻田和二百多米的渠道就要被水冲坏。郭铁城看了看防洪器材，只剩三十多块门板了，用门板挡水又没有木桩。郭铁城决定十个人去砍木桩，自己背着门板跳下水去。抢险的社员看到党总支书记奋不顾身的行动，二十多人也纷纷背着门板跳下了水，筑成了一道堤坝。经过一小时的搏斗，砍木桩的人回来了，大家打桩、挑土，堵住了缺口，洪水被征服了。
