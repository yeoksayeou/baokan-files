Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd. Rural people's communes in Heilongjiang Province are seizing the opportunity to expand the autumn vegetable planting area by every possible means to meet the needs of urban and rural people's lives.

Harbin City, which achieved a bumper harvest of summer vegetables, is taking various measures to rush plant autumn vegetables in people's communes, government offices, schools, and factories. In addition to sowing on the cultivated land originally prepared for vegetables, the Dongfeng Branch of the Taiping People's Commune has also adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, intercropping, replanting, mixed cropping, interplanting, and using scattered gaps to expand planting, planting a large area of autumn vegetables. It has now sown more than 10,800 mu. The land prepared for autumn vegetable planting in the Hejiang area has generally been plowed and harrowed one to two times, with approximately 6,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. Now, more than 21,000 mu have been sown.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient vegetable seeds caused by the expansion of the autumn vegetable planting area, all localities are trying every possible means to tap potential, save seeds, and strive for self-sufficiency. People's communes in the Qiqihar area generally implement the method of harvesting one seed at a time when it ripens, and harvesting one plant at a time when it ripens, while simultaneously sowing. They have harvested more than 220,000 jin of vegetable seeds. With the addition of bartered seeds, they can basically guarantee their needs.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on autumn vegetable production, calling on the people of the province to push the autumn vegetable sowing movement to a climax, expand the autumn vegetable sowing area by every possible means, ensure sufficient planting, good management, and ensure a bumper harvest.

As of the 18th of this month, 790,000 mu of autumn vegetables have been sown in various parts of Shaanxi. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and the call of the Provincial Party Committee, have further promoted the autumn vegetable sowing movement in various places. The Yan'an and Shangluo areas, which have already completed their vegetable planting plans, have recently proposed that each person plant an additional two fen of vegetables. Shangluo alone has increased planting by 18,835 mu. After completing the vegetable sowing plan, the masses in Hancheng County used the "ten-edge" gaps along railways, highways, canals, and around villages, houses, and warehouses to increase planting of more than 72 million pumpkin seedlings and more than 21,000 mu of vegetables. Now, the masses in the county are using various scattered plots of land to increase planting of radishes. Secretaries of party organizations at all levels in the Liuji People's Commune in Tongchuan City personally took the lead, leading more than 5,600 laborers to carry out a blitz interplanting campaign in corn, cotton, sesame, and millet fields where seedlings were missing. By the 13th of this month, they had sown more than 32,000 mu of early-maturing autumn vegetables such as bok choy and radishes, exceeding the task of each person planting an additional five fen of vegetables.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 23rd. A mass movement to rush plant, plant more, and plant good autumn vegetables has been fully launched in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. According to incomplete statistics from various places, the current autumn vegetable sowing area has reached more than 600,000 mu. The 16 banners and cities in the Hulunbuir League, which acted quickly, had exceeded the annual vegetable sowing plan by 17% by the beginning of July, with an average of more than two fen of vegetable land planted for each urban and rural resident in the league. The autumn vegetable sowing speed is also accelerating in the main agricultural areas of the Jerim League and Ulanqab League, the main pastoral areas of the Xilin Gol League, and the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Ik Zhao League.

In the mass movement to plant vegetables, workers, farmers, herdsmen, urban residents, troops, and students across all regions are working together, busy digging land, preparing land, accumulating fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, and rushing to sow seeds. People of all ethnic groups in the Ejin Horo Banner seized the favorable opportunity of recent widespread rains to launch a blitz battle to reclaim wasteland and replant, planting more than 15,000 mu of various autumn vegetables within ten days. In Liangcheng County, Ulanqab League, an average of 2.3 fen of vegetables are planted per person, and the autumn vegetables planted earlier have grown strong stems and fat leaves.

During the vegetable planting movement, rural communes in various places, in addition to reclaiming wasteland and allocating more cultivated land, generally adopted methods such as increasing the number of replanting times, promoting intercropping, interplanting, and using idle land to expand the vegetable area. Urban industrial and mining areas are also reclaiming wasteland on one hand and making full use of idle yards, open spaces, and scattered plots of land in front of and behind houses to plant vegetables.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. The broad masses of commune members in the suburbs of Shanghai are vigorously grasping field management of vegetables and rushing to plant autumn vegetables to ensure rapid increase in vegetable production and balanced supply to the market.

In order to ensure a sufficient supply of vegetables to the market during the slack season of summer vegetables, the vegetable areas in the suburbs of the city have recently launched a mass movement to rush plant large-scale autumn vegetables over the past month or so. After the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on autumn vegetable production were issued, the broad masses of cadres and people further vigorously grasped vegetable production, and the broad masses of cadres went to the forefront of vegetable production. The Secretary of the Baoshan County Dachang Commune Party Committee personally grasped vegetable production, and each production team was also responsible by the branch secretary, absorbing old farmers to form vegetable production research groups to supervise and inspect, ensuring that various management measures were implemented in a timely manner.

The commune members are working with soaring enthusiasm in vigorously grasping vegetable production. The water in the river is scorched by the sun during the day and is not suitable for watering vegetables. The commune members of the Pengpu Commune rested during the day and watered the vegetables all night, irrigating more than 2,500 mu every night. They also expanded the planting of heat-resistant amaranth and water spinach in response to the unfavorable conditions of the drought. Eight hundred mu of amaranth were rush planted in fifteen days; the planting area of water spinach was expanded from the original plan of eighty mu to more than 660 mu.

Because field management of vegetables is grasped tightly and meticulously, the suburban vegetables are growing very well. The amount of vegetables on the market in the Chengqiao Production Team of the Xinjing Commune in Shanghai County has rapidly increased from about 7,000 jin per day at the beginning of July to more than 18,000 jin. The amount of vegetables on the market in the Hangtou Commune of Nanhui County has also exceeded the planned supply number by 25%.

    各地为了解决秋菜种植面积扩大带来的菜籽不足问题，都千方百计的挖潜力，节省用种，力争自给。齐齐哈尔地区各人民公社对栽植在田间的菜籽普遍实行熟一粒收一粒，熟一棵收一棵，边收边播的办法，共收获了菜籽二十二万多斤，加上串换，基本可保证需要。
    新华社西安23日电　中共陕西省委和陕西省人委坚决贯彻执行中共中央、国务院关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示，号召全省人民把秋菜播种运动推向高潮，千方百计扩大秋菜播种面积，保证种足、管好、确保丰收。
    截至本月18日，陕西各地已播种秋菜七十九万亩。中共中央、国务院的指示和省委的号召，进一步推动了各地的秋菜播种运动。已经完成了种菜计划的延安、商雒两个专区，最近都提出每人再增种二分菜，仅商雒一个专区已增种了一万八千八百三十五亩。韩城县群众在已完成蔬菜播种计划以后，又利用铁路、公路、渠道沿线以及村边屋边、库边等“十边”隙地增种了南瓜七千二百多万窝，蔬菜二万一千多亩，现在全县群众又利用各种零星土地增种萝卜。铜川市刘集人民公社各级党组织的书记亲自上阵，率领五千六百多名劳力，在缺苗的玉米、棉花、芝麻、糜谷等地内进行突击套种，到本月13日止，已播种小白菜、萝卜等早熟秋菜三万二千多亩，超额完成了每人增种五分蔬菜的任务。
    新华社呼和浩特23日电　一个抢种、多种、种好秋菜的群众运动，已在内蒙古自治区各地全面展开。据各地不完全统计，目前秋菜播种面积已达六十多万亩。行动快的呼伦贝尔盟十六个旗、市，到7月上旬已超额17％完成了全年蔬菜播种计划，平均全盟每一城乡人口种菜二分多地。主要农业区哲里木盟、乌兰察布盟，主要牧业区锡林郭勒盟和半农半牧区伊克昭盟等地，秋菜播种速度也日益加快。
    在大种蔬菜的群众运动中，各地职工、农民、牧民、城镇居民、部队、学生拧成一股绳，忙着挖地整地，积肥送肥，抢墒下种。伊金霍洛旗各族人民抓紧最近普降喜雨的大好时机，展开开荒复种突击战，十天内就种上各种秋菜一万五千多亩。乌兰察布盟凉城县平均每人种菜二分三厘，种得较早的秋菜已长得茎壮叶肥。
    在种菜运动中，各地农村公社除开荒和增拨耕地外，普遍采取增加复种次数、推行套种、插种和利用闲地等办法，来扩大蔬菜面积。城镇工矿区也一面开垦荒地，一面尽量利用闲场空地、房前屋后零星土地种菜。
    新华社上海23日电　上海市郊广大人民公社社员，正在大抓蔬菜田间管理，突击抢种秋菜，以保证蔬菜迅速增产和对市场的均衡供应。
    市郊各蔬菜区，为了在酷暑的蔬菜淡季，保证市场蔬菜的充分供应，最近一个多月来，掀起了抢种大秋蔬菜的群众运动。党中央、国务院关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示下达以后，广大干部和群众更进一步大抓蔬菜生产，广大干部纷纷走上蔬菜生产第一线。宝山县大场公社党委书记亲自抓蔬菜生产，各生产队也由支部书记负责，吸收老农组成蔬菜生产研究小组，督促检查，保证各项管理措施及时贯彻。
    社员们在大抓蔬菜生产中干劲冲天。白天河里的水被太阳晒烫，不适宜浇菜，彭浦公社的社员们就白天休息，夜里通宵浇菜，每夜都灌溉二千五百多亩。他们还针对天气干旱的不利条件，扩种耐高温的米苋和蓊菜。在十五天内抢种了八百多亩米苋；蓊菜由原计划的八十亩扩大到六百六十多亩。
    由于蔬菜田间管理抓得紧、抓得细，郊区蔬菜都长得很好。上海县新泾公社程桥生产队蔬菜上市量从7月初每天七千斤左右迅速上升到一万八千多斤。南汇县航头公社的蔬菜上市量也超过计划供应数25％。
