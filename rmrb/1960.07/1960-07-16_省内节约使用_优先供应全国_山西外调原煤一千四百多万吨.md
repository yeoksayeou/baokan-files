Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 15th: Shanxi Province is implementing the spirit of prioritizing external needs over internal ones, giving priority to coal transportation to ensure the needs of key enterprises. To date, the province has transferred over 14.45 million tons of coal to support various regions, an increase of 20.9% over the same period last year.

The raw coal produced in Shanxi Province supplies twenty-one provinces and cities across the country, as well as thirty-seven enterprises under the central ministries and bureaus. To ensure timely supply, Party committees at all levels in Shanxi Province, in addition to regularly conducting ideological education on the concept of "the whole nation as a single chessboard" for workers, have also strengthened specific measures. The method of ensuring external coal transfer by saving coal and reducing inventory in provincial enterprises is an important measure for Shanxi Province to implement the principle of prioritizing external needs over internal ones and prioritizing key needs over general ones. Since March, large and medium-sized factories and mines throughout the province have widely promoted the experience of coal gasification. In the first half of this year, industrial and mining enterprises across the province generally saved about 15% to 20% of coal consumption. While saving coal, enterprises have also vigorously reduced inventory to ensure that raw coal is shipped out first. According to a recent survey of key metallurgical power generation and other coal-consuming enterprises in the province, the reasonable inventory of these enterprises has generally been reduced to less than half a month.

In order to load more and transport faster to ensure coal supply to key areas across the country, Shanxi Province has vigorously strengthened transportation work. Since the beginning of this year, more than 100 kilometers of large and light railways in mining areas have been completed throughout the province. More than 40 sliding hopper coal bunkers have been newly built in various coal mines, which greatly speeds up the loading speed. The general loading time has been shortened from two to three hours to two to three minutes. In the locations of major coal mines, Party organizations have repeatedly mobilized the masses to transfer coal stocks to railway loading points as soon as possible to ensure external transportation. They also put forward the slogan "Rather have coal waiting for trains than trains waiting for coal." Most of the coal from Datong Coal Mine is supplied to key enterprises. In order to ensure that the coal is transported out as soon as possible, the Datong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized more than 1,000 factory workers, commune members, and street residents since the beginning of this year to assist the coal mine in transferring more than 200,000 tons of coal stocks. In addition, in order to transport coal stocks from places far away from the station to the collection and transportation points, the provincial transportation department has also dispatched more than 200 trucks to carry out short-distance transportation for the coal mines.

　　省内节约使用　优先供应全国
　　山西外调原煤一千四百多万吨
    据新华社太原15日电　山西省贯彻先外后内的精神，优先调运煤炭，保证重点企业需要。到目前为止，全省今年外调支援各地的煤炭已达一千四百五十多万吨，比去年同期增加20.9％。
    山西省生产的原煤供应着全国二十一个省市和三十七个中央部局所属企业。为了保证做到及时供应，山西省各级党委除经常对职工进行全国一盘棋的思想教育外，还加强了具体措施。用省内各企业节约用煤、压缩库存的办法，保证原煤外调，是山西省贯彻先外后内先重点后一般的方针的一条重要措施。3月份以来，全省大中型厂矿企业普遍推广了煤气化的经验，今年上半年全省各工矿企业一般节约用煤在15％到20％左右。各企业在节约用煤的同时，并大力压缩库存，保证原煤首先外运。据最近在省内的重点冶金发电等用煤较多的企业调查，这些企业的合理库存一般都压到半个月以下。
    为了多装快运，保证全国重点地区的用煤，山西省各地大力加强运输工作。今年以来，全省已经建成的矿区大铁路和轻便铁路共有一百多公里，在各煤矿还新建了四十多座滑坡漏斗煤仓，装车速度大大加快，一般装车时间由两三个小时缩短到两三分钟。在各大煤矿所在地，为了把存煤尽快地运到铁路装车点，保证外运，这些地区的党组织曾多次发动群众倒运存煤。并提出“宁叫煤等车不叫车等煤”的口号。大同煤矿的煤绝大部分都是供应重点企业，为保证尽快地把煤运出去，今年以来，中共大同市委曾组织工厂职工、公社社员和街道居民共一千多人，协助煤矿倒运存煤二十多万吨。此外，为了把离车站较远地方的存煤运往集运地点，省运输部门还抽调二百多部汽车，经常为煤矿进行短途搬运。
