　　Wuzhou Prefecture Cadres Vigorously Cultivate "Canteen Experimental Plots"

　　Wuzhou Prefecture, Guangxi, is widely carrying out a mass canteen movement led by secretaries and joined by cadres in canteens. The prefecture's more than 157,000 canteens are becoming increasingly consolidated and are being run better and better. Currently, 13 county Party secretaries, 340 commune Party secretaries, 2,474 brigade Party branch secretaries, and 14,423 cadres at all levels throughout the prefecture are participating in cultivating canteen "experimental plots" or "command plots." Because cadres at all levels go deep into the canteens and vigorously cultivate canteen "experimental plots," it is easier to summarize experiences in a timely manner, identify problems, and solve problems. Through the demonstration of "experimental plots," they can more effectively use key points to guide the overall work of running canteens well.
