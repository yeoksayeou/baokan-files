Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 2nd—Responding to the call of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the people of Vietnam have launched a vigorous movement against the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem in recent days. The shouts of "Down with U.S. Imperialism" resound throughout the country.

Tens of thousands of people in Hanoi held demonstrations and rallies on July 1st, braving the heavy rain, to protest the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. From June 29th to July 1st, a total of about 100,000 people in Hanoi held such rallies and demonstrations. Participants resolutely expressed their support for Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's letter of June 24th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, demanding that the International Commission rescind its conclusion on allowing the increase of military personnel by the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" and its view that Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 was unrelated to the Geneva Accords. The Vietnam Women's Union also wrote to the Women's International Democratic Federation, asking it to intervene regarding these two inappropriate conclusions of the International Commission.

Workers in factories and enterprises in Hanoi have launched labor competitions to oppose U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique with practical actions. Many factories have initiated "Anti-American Labor Days." Workers have decided to transform hatred into strength, vigorously carry out technical innovations, improve working methods, and increase work efficiency, in order to overfulfill the state plan.

The cultural circles in Hanoi have also actively participated in the anti-American movement. The Vietnam Film Distribution and Screening Company has decided to hold a "United Struggle Film Distribution Fortnight" starting from July 3rd, reflecting the struggle of the people in various regions against the U.S.-Ngo clique and fully exposing the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo clique.

Phu Tho and Yen Bai Provinces, and the Vinh Linh area located on the demarcation line, have also held rallies and marches against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique in recent days. Phu Tho Province launched a twenty-day "Anti-American Production Labor" movement from July 1st, striving for a bumper late rice harvest. While carrying out the movement against the U.S.-Ngo clique, Vinh Linh area is also calling on the people to vigorously strive for a bumper late rice harvest.
