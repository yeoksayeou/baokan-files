The Congo River is roaring. This river, which has suffered the oppression of colonialism for nearly a century, has never flowed smoothly. Now it roars, wanting to break through all obstacles hindering its progress, and surge freely in its own riverbed, on its own land!

Every day, when we open the newspaper, our hearts fly to Africa, to that sparkling gem. Our Congolese brothers are engaged in a heroic struggle against the colonialists. For nearly a century, the Congolese people have suffered the cruel rule and barbaric plunder of the colonialists. The Congo is extremely rich in underground resources; its uranium, tin, copper, gold, and diamonds rank first in the capitalist world. However, these treasures did not belong to the Congolese people themselves in the past. Foreign monopoly capital extracted profits of up to several billion Congolese francs from the Congo every year. Under the barbaric oppression of the colonialists, the Congolese lived a life worse than that of beasts of burden, without enough food or clothing, and the mortality rate reached an alarming level. Since 1884, the Congolese population has plummeted from 30 million to 12 million. The crimes of colonialism are truly countless. The Congolese people are unwilling to endure this cruel colonial rule. For more than eighty years, they have waged unyielding struggles against colonialism. Especially since last year, with the awakening of the people of the African continent, the flames of the Congolese people's struggle have burned more and more fiercely. In the face of the flames of the people's struggle, the colonialists were forced to agree to the Congo's declaration of independence. However, the plundering nature of the colonialists will not truly change. When the Congolese people and soldiers rose up to resist the control and oppression of the colonialists, touching their sore spot, their robber-like faces reappeared. The old colonialist, Belgium, with the support of the American-led imperialist bloc, brazenly launched an armed invasion of the Congo. And American imperialism, which had long coveted the treasures of the Congo, has constantly infiltrated. Eisenhower once said, "I really can't understand what we would do without the Congo?" Now, they are rolling up their sleeves, trying to take advantage of the chaos. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "When we say that 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas, until their demise." Doesn't the Belgian and American aggression and interference in the Congo once again prove the complete correctness of this statement?

The Congo's declaration of independence is the result of the Congolese brothers' struggle, and also the beginning of a new struggle; the complete independence and freedom of the Congo still requires a sustained and arduous struggle. Struggle, struggle, is the only way to deal with all imperialism. Our Congolese brothers are brave and tenacious in their struggle against the enemy. Decades of strict control by the Belgian colonialists meant that not a single Congolese had ever served as an officer above the rank of lieutenant in the army. However, today's Congolese army has dealt a great blow to the fully modernized Belgian invading army. Brave Congolese brothers! Although your republic is so young and the enemy is so ferocious, your cause is just, and a just cause will inevitably grow and strengthen in the struggle. Refusing to lay down their arms and taking their weapons into the mountains, some Congolese brothers have already begun to do so. That's right! A Western bourgeois reporter asked you, "What are you going there to do?" You replied, "To fight." "Who are you fighting?" You said unequivocally, "Fight the enemy!" What a resolute and powerful answer! The road of struggle is always tortuous and arduous, but as long as you persist in the struggle, the storm will always pass, and dawn will always shine on your beautiful oasis!

    暴风雨的后面是曙光
    苏海明
    刚果河在咆哮。这条近一个世纪以来受尽殖民主义者压抑的刚果河水，从来没有舒畅地奔流过，如今它咆哮了，要冲决那阻挠它前进的一切障碍，在自己的河道里，在自己的土地上，自由地奔腾！
    每天，当我们打开报纸的时候，我们的心啊，都飞向非洲，飞向那块亮晶晶的宝石。我们的刚果兄弟正在同殖民主义者进行英勇的斗争。将近一个世纪来，刚果人民饱受殖民主义者的残酷统治和野蛮的掠夺。刚果的地下宝藏是极其丰富的，它的铀、锡、铜、金、金刚石，占资本主义世界的第一位，然而这些宝藏过去却不属于刚果人自己所有。外国垄断资本每年从刚果攫取高达几十亿刚果法郎的利润。在殖民主义者的野蛮压迫下，刚果人过的是牛马不如的生活，食不果腹，衣不蔽体，死亡率达到惊人的程度，从1884年以来，刚果人口由三千万急剧下降到一千二百万。殖民主义的罪行真是罄竹难书。刚果人是不甘于忍受这种残忍的殖民统治的，八十多年来，他们进行了反对殖民主义的不屈不挠的斗争，特别是去年以来，随着非洲大陆人民的觉醒，刚果人民斗争的烈火越烧越炽烈。在人民的斗争的烈火面前，殖民主义者被迫同意刚果宣布独立。但是，殖民主义者掠夺的本性，是不会真正改变的。当刚果人民和士兵起来反抗殖民主义者的控制和压迫，触到他们的疼处的时候，他们的强盗面目又重新出现了。老牌殖民主义者比利时，在以美国为首的帝国主义集团支持下，悍然发动了对刚果的武装侵略。而美帝国主义，对于刚果的宝藏，也早已垂涎三尺，不断渗入。艾森豪威尔就曾说过：“我真不能理解，如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办？”现在，更是捋起袖管，企图趁火打劫了。毛泽东主席说过：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”比利时和美国在刚果的侵略与干涉，不是再一次证明了这句话的完全正确吗？
    刚果的宣布独立，是刚果兄弟斗争的结果，也是新的斗争的开始；刚果的完全独立和自由，还需要持续的坚韧的斗争。斗争，斗争，是对付一切帝国主义的唯一的办法。我们的刚果兄弟在和敌人的斗争中，是英勇而顽强的。比利时殖民者数十年的严密控制，没有一个刚果人在部队里当过尉级以上的军官，然而，今天的刚果军队，却给了全部现代化装备的比利时侵略军以极大的打击。英勇的刚果兄弟！尽管你们的共和国是多么年青，敌人是多么凶恶，但你们的事业是正义的，正义的事业必然会在斗争中成长壮大。拒绝放下武器，带着武器到山里去，有些刚果兄弟已经开始这样做了。做得对呀！一位西方资产阶级记者问你们：“到那里去干什么？”你们回答说：“打仗。”“同谁打仗？”你们毫不含糊地说：“打敌人！”回答得多么坚决有力！斗争的道路总是曲折艰巨的，但是只要坚持斗争，暴风雨总会过去，曙光总会照耀着你们的美丽的绿洲！
