Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: South Korean "Democratic Party" upper echelons and other traitorous politicians, in order to seize power through the pseudo-"National Assembly election" held on the 29th, used all kinds of shameless deception, which aroused great anger among the people in various parts of South Korea.

According to Western news agencies, the people of Masan, who held a large demonstration against the Lee Seung-man group's fabrication of the pseudo-"presidential election" on March 15 this year, held a demonstration on the 29th with 20,000 people to oppose Lee Seung-man's henchman, Lee Yong-beom, "running" for "National Assembly member" here.

According to the Hapdong News Agency, on the 29th, more than 3,000 residents of Yeongdo District, Busan, surrounded the Namhang 3rd polling station in Yeongdo District. They angrily shouted slogans against holding an improper "election," condemned the shameless behavior of the "Democratic Party," and advocated that this "election" was invalid. At 11 p.m., the masses also arrested the "Democratic Party" "candidate" who was "running" in the local area.

According to Busan Culture Broadcasting Station, South Korean university students recently formed a "Student Enlightenment Team to Promote Citizen Elections" and launched a propaganda campaign in various places to expose the reactionary nature of the upper echelons of the "Democratic Party." They pointed out that the "Democratic Party" "only supports the powerful and the rich, and is not a party that supports the working masses."

According to the South Korean Hapdong News Agency, more than 200 residents of Ahyeon-dong, Mapo District, Seoul, held a sit-down demonstration in front of the second polling station at 9 p.m. on the 29th, protesting the illegal activities of traitorous politicians in this pseudo-"National Assembly election." It was revealed that the "party" in this dong, which served as a running dog for the traitorous politicians, threw bundles of fake "ballots" into the ballot box after the voting ended.

In Samcheonpo, Gyeongsangnam-do, more than 2,000 citizens rose up on the 29th to angrily oppose the shameless behavior of Lee Seung-man's "Liberal Party" thugs "running" here and attempting to regain power. According to the Dongyang News Agency, residents here rushed into the puppet municipal government, which served as the "counting place," at 11 p.m. on the 29th, destroyed tables and ballot boxes, and burned all nine ballot boxes. The police dispatched by the puppet authorities came to suppress them, and the masses fought the police with stones and sticks, injuring more than 40 policemen.

In Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, more than 3,000 people burned 88 ballot boxes at 11 a.m. on the 30th to oppose Lee Seung-man's Liberal Party thug, Choi Seok-lim, serving as a "candidate" for "National Assembly member" there, and destroyed the police station there with stones. Under the stubborn struggle of the masses, the "election committee chairman" there finally had to declare the "election invalid."

In Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do, a mass demonstration of 4,500 people also broke out on the 29th, opposing Lee Seung-man's Liberal Party thug, Lee Yong-beom, running for "National Assembly member" there.

In Gyeongsangbuk-do, more than 500 citizens in Gimcheon City rushed into the counting place on the morning of the 30th, shouting slogans against the improper election, destroying 18 ballot boxes and tearing up ballots. The demonstrators also smashed the residence of Lee Seung-man's thug who was running for "National Assembly member" there, as well as his "election office."

In Yeongyang County, Gyeongsangbuk-do, a demonstration against the "election" also broke out, and the masses attacked the counting place and burned 22 ballot boxes.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th: Seoul News: Under the manipulation and support of US imperialism, the reactionary upper echelons of the South Korean "Democratic Party" stole a majority of seats in the "National Assembly" in the "National Assembly election" farce held on the 29th through various shameless methods of deception and fraud. Lee Seung-man's Liberal Party suffered a crushing defeat.

According to the South Korean News Agency, as of 5 p.m. today, out of the 188 "elected" "National Assembly members" that have been announced (out of a total of 233 seats), the "Democratic Party" accounted for 146. The Lee Seung-man's Liberal Party, which occupied 150 seats before the "election," has so far only won one seat.

The results of the "Senate" "election" will not be calculated until the "National Assembly" has finished counting.

In this "election," the ugly deeds of the "Democratic Party's" reactionary upper echelons engaging in private gain and fraud were exposed everywhere. According to the South Korean News Agency, they bought off some running dogs and used various deceptive methods such as proxy voting, voting two or three times, and forging ballots to make themselves "elected." When the votes were counted in Jinjia District of Busan, the number of votes obtained by the "Democratic Party's" "candidate" was much more than the total number of "voters" in the district. The fraud of the "Democratic Party" was exposed in the counting of votes in Jia District and Eul District of Jeonju, "causing a major disturbance."

    据釜山文化广播电台广播，南朝鲜的大学生最近组成了“促进公民选举学生启蒙队”，在各地展开揭露“民主党”上层反动本质的宣传运动。他们指出，“民主党”“只拥护有势力的和有钱的人，并不是拥护劳苦大众的政党。”
    据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，汉城麻浦区阿岘洞的二百多名居民29日晚九时在第二投票所前举行静坐示威，抗议卖国政客在这次伪“国会选举”中的不法行为。据揭露，为卖国政客充当狗腿子的这个洞的“政党”在投票结束后，把成捆的假“选票”投入了选票箱。
