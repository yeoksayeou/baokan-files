　　Specific Education Based on Specific Ideas
　　The Shanghai Wuliqiao Party Committee's Julong Branch in Tianjin Does a Good Job in Political and Ideological Work

　　(Our dispatch) The leading cadres of the Wuliqiao Street Party Committee in Shanghai's Luwan District went deep into the alleys and among the masses, earnestly and practically conducting specific ideological education based on the specific ideological conditions of the masses. They helped street industries solve key production problems, enabling newly established production organizations to quickly embark on a path of healthy development.

　　The ten neighborhood committees under the Wuliqiao Street Party Committee have a total of 101 production organizations, with more than 2,600 residents participating in production. Most of these production organizations were developed during the mass movement to vigorously develop street and neighborhood production in March and April of this year. Due to the rapid development, some newly established factories and production teams experienced unstable production and inadequate labor organization and management systems. Therefore, starting in late April, the Street Party Committee focused on rectification, consolidation, and improvement, putting forward the slogan "Go to the production site to lead production, go to the masses to lead the masses," and thoroughly changed its leadership style. All four secretaries of the Party Committee and other leading cadres went to work in the neighborhood committees, dividing areas, setting points, and taking charge of specific tasks, earnestly and practically carrying out work with the neighborhood cadres on the front lines. The First Secretary of the Party Committee personally went to the neighborhood committee with the most difficulties to focus on the backward and address the weak links.

　　After the leading cadres of the Party Committee went deep into the neighborhood committees, they gained a more specific and detailed understanding of the ideological dynamics of the production personnel. They found that the vast majority of production personnel had high enthusiasm for labor, but a few had just left their homes and were not yet accustomed to collective production and did not sufficiently abide by labor discipline. In response to the ideological situation of the masses, the Party Committee adopted methods such as report meetings, group discussions, family visits, and individual talks to enable the masses to further see the current excellent situation, understand the great significance of establishing urban people's communes, and correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective. Through relatively systematic education, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the production personnel were greatly improved. Since May, the attendance rate of various production organizations has generally risen to over 90%. The No. 1 Middle Neighborhood Committee, which had previously been lagging behind in its work, put forward the slogan of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, and the average daily output of its eight factories and teams increased by 40% within a few days.

　　On the basis of the enhanced political and ideological awareness of the production personnel, the various neighborhood committees, with the help of the leading cadres of the Street Party Committee, universally strengthened the organizational leadership of the production units, established and improved the necessary production management systems, enabling some factories and production teams with insufficient production order to quickly get on the right track. Now, every production organization in this area has established a democratic management committee or a democratic management team through mass elections. Responsible and serious working laborers with good political and ideological understanding serve as leaders, forming a leadership core. Systems such as attendance, production records, quality inspection, raw material storage, and financial budget approval have also been established. In daily production leadership, production plans are handed over to the masses for discussion, targets are assigned to individuals, and the progress of implementation is announced daily. Many units also implement a "three-grasp" method per day, grasping production preparation in the morning, grasping progress at noon, and grasping completion in the evening. These measures have effectively promoted the further improvement of production levels. Due to the strengthening of the organizational management of production units, the Street Party Committee and the Neighborhood Committee are also well-informed about the production situation, which enables them to timely allocate processing tasks and dispatch labor, so that various production organizations can carry out production in a balanced manner and fully tap production potential.

　　The leading cadres of the Street Party Committee went deep into the factories and studied ways to expand production with the masses. Based on the favorable conditions of having many factories and a large amount of waste materials in this area, they vigorously carried out comprehensive utilization of waste products according to local conditions. To date, they have extracted more than 20 kinds of chemical raw materials from various waste liquids and scraps, which have been successively put into production. In addition, they actively established cooperative relationships with state-owned factories to process parts and semi-finished products for large factories.

　　(Our dispatch) The Julong Branch of the Xing'an Road People's Commune in Tianjin City fully exerted the core leading role of the Party and the exemplary leading role of Party members, further inspiring the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members and enabling the commune's various undertakings to achieve great development.

　　The Julong Branch Party Committee conscientiously implemented the policy of running commune-operated industries to serve large-scale industries and the people's lives. This branch has five production units, all of which use edge materials and waste materials from large factories and raw materials allocated by commercial departments to process products needed by large-scale industries and the market. In order to make the commune-operated industry develop in the correct direction, the Party Branch led the commune members to conduct continuous struggles against various erroneous business ideas. For example, when vigorously developing small commodity production last year, some people in the commune-operated hardware factory believed that small parts had low output value and cost labor hours. They repeatedly requested abolishing the contracts signed with relevant large factories and changing to producing products with high output value and high profits. After the branch discovered this problem, it immediately conducted education for the commune members, corrected this tendency, and led the commune members to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, change the face of production, and improve labor productivity. After the commune members changed the hand-cranked ramming machine to an electric ramming machine, labor efficiency increased by more than double. At the same time, a large number of surplus labor forces were released, and new varieties such as carding and automobile parts were added, increasing the daily output value from 50 yuan to 6,000 yuan.

　　The Communist Party members of the Julong Branch went deep into the front line of production and played an exemplary role in production. Among the sixteen Party members in the entire branch, twelve are serving as leaders such as factory directors and directors. Most of them are excellent street activists who have been cultivated by the Party for many years. Under the education of the Party, these Party members who are serving in leadership positions personally go to the workshops and machines, study production technology with the masses, and jointly solve key problems in production, achieving participation in production and leadership in production. Many people have also been trained as production experts and become role models for the masses to learn from. Over the past year, a total of ten Party members in the entire branch have won the honorary titles of municipal-level and district-level advanced workers and red banner bearers. In order to motivate the masses to do a good job, the branch also frequently transfers Party members to the most difficult places. Because the branch fully exerted the core leading role of the Party and the exemplary leading role of Party members in various undertakings of the branch, it further inspired the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, enabling the various tasks of the branch to achieve comprehensive and rapid development. In May of this year, the production of the Julong Branch increased by more than double compared to April, and the output value in June increased by 30% compared to May. Various welfare and cultural and educational undertakings have also been developed accordingly.

    根据具体思想进行具体教育
　　上海五里桥党委天津巨龙分社支部政治思想工作做得好
    本报讯　上海市卢湾区五里桥街道党委的领导干部，深入里弄，深入群众，踏踏实实地根据群众的具体思想情况，进行具体的思想教育，帮助街道工业解决生产中的关键问题，使新办的生产组织迅速走上健康发展的道路。
    五里桥街道党委所属十个里弄委员会，共有生产组织一百零一个，参加生产的居民有二千六百多人。这些生产组织大多是在今年
  3、4月份大办街道、里弄生产事业的群众运动中发展起来的。由于发展快，有一部分新办工场和生产组出现了生产不够稳定，劳动组织、管理制度不够健全等现象。因此，街道党委从4月下旬起，大抓整顿、巩固和提高工作，提出“到生产现场去领导生产，到群众中去领导群众”的口号，彻底改变领导作风。党委四个书记和其他领导干部全部下里弄办公，划片定点、分头包干，踏踏实实地和里弄干部一起深入现场开展工作。党委第一书记亲自到困难最多的里弄委员会抓后进，抓薄弱环节。
    党委领导干部深入里弄以后，对生产人员的思想动态了解得更加具体细致，他们发现极大多数生产人员的劳动热情很高，但是也有少数人刚走出家门，对集体生产一时还不习惯、遵守劳动纪律不够。党委针对群众的思想情况，采取报告会、小组讨论、家庭访问、个别谈心等方式，使群众进一步看清当前的大好形势，认识建立城市人民公社的巨大意义和如何正确对待个人与集体的关系。通过比较系统的教育，生产人员的政治觉悟和劳动积极性大大提高。5月份以来，各生产组织的出勤率普遍上升到90％以上。过去工作比较落后的中一里弄委员会，提出了学先进、赶先进的口号，所属八个工场和小组的平均日产量几天内提高40％。
    在生产人员政治思想觉悟提高的基础上，各里弄委员会在街道党委领导干部帮助下，普遍加强了生产单位的组织领导，建立和健全必要的生产管理制度，使一些生产秩序不够正常的工场和生产组迅速走上正轨。现在这个地区的每一个生产组织都通过群众选举，建立了民主管理委员会或民主管理小组，由政治思想好、工作认真的劳动人民担任负责人，组成领导核心，并且建立了考勤、生产纪录、质量检验、原材料保管、财务预算审批等制度，在日常的生产领导中，生产计划都交给群众讨论，指标落实到人，天天公布执行进度。不少单位还实行一天三抓的办法，早上抓生产准备，中午抓进度，晚上抓完成情况。这些措施有效地促进了生产水平的进一步提高。由于生产单位的组织管理工作加强，街道党委和里弄委员会对生产情况也心中有数，就能及时调配加工任务，调度劳动力，使各个生产组织都能均衡地进行生产，充分挖掘了生产潜力。
    街道党委的领导干部深入工场和群众一起研究扩大生产的门路。他们根据这个地区工厂多、下脚废料也多的有利条件，因地制宜大搞废品综合利用。到目前止，他们从各种废液、下脚中提炼出来的化工原料，已有二十多种陆续投入生产。此外，他们还积极地与国营工厂建立协作关系，为大厂加工零件和半制品。
    本报讯　天津市兴安路人民公社巨龙分社党支部，充分发挥党的核心领导作用和党员的模范带头作用，更加鼓舞了广大社员的积极性，使公社各项事业获得了很大发展。
    巨龙分社党支部认真贯彻了社办工业为大工业、为人民生活服务的方针。这个分社有五个生产单位，都是利用大工厂的边材废料和商业部门调拨的原材物料，为大工业和市场加工所需要的产品。为了使社办工业向正确的方向发展，党支部领导社员向各种错误经营思想进行了不断的斗争，例如去年大搞小商品生产的时候，社办五金厂有些人认为小零件产值低，又花费工时，曾几次要求废除和有关大工厂签订的合同，改变生产产值大、利润高的产品。支部发现这一问题后，立即向社员们进行教育，纠正了这种倾向。并领导社员们大搞技术革新和技术革命，改变生产面貌，提高劳动生产率。经社员们把手摇捣机改成电动捣机后，劳动效率提高一倍以上，同时腾出大批的富余劳动力，又增加了划卡、汽车零件等新品种。使日产值由每天五十元猛增到每天六千元。
    巨龙分社的共产党员都深入生产第一线，正在生产中发挥模范带头作用。全分社的十六名党员中，有十二名担任着厂长、主任等领导工作，他们绝大多数都是经过党多年培养的一些优秀的街道积极分子。这些担任领导工作的党员在党的教育下，都亲自下车间、上车床，与群众一起研究生产技术，共同解决生产中的关键问题，做到参加生产、领导生产。不少人还锻炼成了生产能手，成为群众学习的榜样。一年多来，全分社共有十名党员获得了市级、区级先进工作者和红旗手的光荣称号。为了带动群众做好工作，支部还经常把党员调到最困难的地方去。由于支部在分社的各项事业中，充分发挥了党的核心领导作用和党员的模范带头作用，从而更加鼓舞了广大社员的积极性，使得分社的各项工作都得到全面飞跃的发展。今年5月份，巨龙分社的生产比4月份增长了一倍以上，6月份又比5月份产值增长了30％；各项福利和文教事业也都相应地得到了发展。
