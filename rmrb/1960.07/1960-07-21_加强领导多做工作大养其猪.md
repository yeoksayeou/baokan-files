Strengthen Leadership, Do More Work, Vigorously Raise Pigs

Since the large-scale development of the pig industry across the country last winter and this spring, progress has been uneven. There are many reasons for this, but the most important one is whether the leadership has determination, is meticulous, and has patience. In a word, it depends on whether the leadership's thinking and work style can adapt to the requirements of the large-scale development of the pig industry.

The benefits of raising pigs are numerous. Is it possible that some people cannot make the determination to raise pigs on a large scale? Yes. Some comrades have not truly understood the relationship between agriculture and pig raising, so they have not yet made this determination. Agriculture and pig raising promote each other. Fields use feed to raise pigs, and pigs use manure to nourish the fields. "Good harvests of grain, thriving livestock" is the unified aspect of them, or rather, the result of appropriately resolving the relationship between the two. However, they also have contradictory aspects. To raise a large number of pigs, how can the feed problem be solved? How should the establishment of feed bases and the arrangement of grain planting area and feed planting area be arranged? Where should funds and materials be drawn from to build new breeding farms? How to allocate labor to organize pig raising professional teams? And so on, all are contradictions. If you are frightened by these contradictions, if you dare not take action to solve these contradictions, you will not be able to make the determination to develop the pig industry on a large scale. Some comrades are afraid of hindering agriculture and dare not engage in pig raising on a large scale. As a result, from the perspective of long-term development prospects, they are precisely weakening agriculture. As everyone knows, fertilizer is the "food" of crops. The inability of fertilizer to meet the needs of substantial increases in production is an extremely acute problem in current agricultural production. Raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer is one of the most effective measures to solve the fertilizer problem. In this sense, grasping pig raising is grasping agriculture. Except for some minority areas, all regions must always "raise their pigs in a big way." Those contradictions mentioned above must be resolved sooner or later. Solving it earlier is better than solving it later; solving it earlier can bring benefits sooner. To resolve this contradiction, everyone should do the math and make a plan to comprehensively arrange agriculture and animal husbandry. Without appropriate relaxation in this area, there will be no necessary focus in that area. Squeezing out some feed land, some labor, funds, and materials in agriculture may seem to have some adverse effects on agriculture this year; however, it will give us double compensation next year. The important thing here is not to calculate small gains, but to calculate big gains.

To raise pigs in large numbers and well, it is not enough to have determination. You must also be very meticulous and eliminate bureaucracy. China is the earliest country in the world to raise pigs and also the country with the most pigs. However, before liberation, there were at most only tens of millions of pigs, all raised individually by households. This mode of production and management in the era of small-scale peasant economy has remained unchanged for thousands of years. After the realization of people's communes in rural China, the pig industry has developed rapidly, the number of pigs has increased rapidly, and socialist collective breeding has become the main mode of production. This great change has put forward a series of new problems for the pig industry in terms of feed supply, disease prevention, and feeding management. If you don't put in a lot of hard work, you won't be able to solve these problems well. Pigs are living things, they need to eat when they are hungry, they need to be treated when they are sick. During the period of sow reproduction and piglet weaning, phenomena of weakness, emaciation, and death are more likely to occur, so there is no room for bureaucracy here. Why does the number of pigs on hand in some places rise and fall? The main reason is that the local leaders are satisfied with general calls, do not carry out specific organizational work, do not understand the actual situation, and do not solve various urgent problems in a timely manner, so the amount of pig breeding cannot rise steadily. The number of pigs in Linru County, Henan Province, has grown rapidly. Their main experience is that the leaders attach importance to the pig industry and grasp the pig industry as they grasp agriculture. They established a livestock front with full-time leaders, specialized institutions, and professional teams from the county to the commune and production team. The county party committee has a secretary in charge of animal husbandry, and each commune selected more than 300 members of the party committee and brigade branch secretaries to serve as farm managers and branch secretaries in pig farms, and also transferred more than 1,600 party and Communist Youth League members to serve as feeders. Among the secretaries of party organizations in the county, communes, and production teams, more than 500 went deep into pig farms, established pig raising experimental fields, discovered problems, solved problems, summarized experiences, and promoted experiences in a timely manner. The three-level secretaries went to pig farms, and the cadres vigorously carried out pig raising experimental fields. They created a good experience for the leadership of the continuous leap forward in pig production.

The development of any thing is not smooth sailing. This is of course the case with large-scale development of the pig industry, which involves a wide range of aspects and lacks experience. The situation of ups and downs is difficult to completely avoid at first; the possibility of small rises and falls should be anticipated in the future. Therefore, in order to promote the continuous and high-speed development of the pig industry, it is necessary not only to have determination and be very careful, but also to have patience. Patience is the perseverance to never give up, the spirit of continuous revolution, and the heroic spirit to overcome all difficulties. The process of developing the pig industry is the process of continuously exposing contradictions and overcoming contradictions. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will emerge. It is not possible to have no feed. It is not possible to have feed but not know how to feed it. It is not possible to know how to feed it but not be able to prevent and control epidemics. The leadership must have the determination to grasp it and grasp it to the end, solve whatever problems arise, solve whatever difficulties occur, do it twice if it doesn't work once, do it three times if it doesn't work twice, and continue to move forward without slackening or giving way. Naturally, the pigs can be raised in large numbers and well.

One person raising one pig, one mu of land raising one pig, this is our goal. We should establish such great ambitions and strive to achieve and exceed this goal in the next few years. However, there is always a process from the starting point to the end point, and this process must be completed through hard and intense efforts. Due to different subjective and objective conditions, some regions will take longer to achieve this goal, and some regions may need less time, but regardless of long trips or short walks, they must always start from the first step. The spirit of the Great Leap Forward must be combined with the work style of seeking truth from facts, and the plans and indicators must be built on a solid and reliable foundation. To raise 10,000 pigs, there must be pig sources, feed, manpower, and space to raise 10,000 pigs. If these conditions are not yet available, the indicator of 10,000 pigs will become empty talk. If, after in-depth investigation and research, and fully tapping all potentials, it is still not possible to raise 10,000 pigs, then temporarily lower the indicator, raise today's pigs well, and actively create conditions to raise the indicator tomorrow. Which is better, raising 9,000 pigs, raising them fat and strong, or raising 10,000 pigs, raising some fat and strong, some thin, and some sick and weak? Of course, it is better to raise 9,000 pigs. Raising 9,000 pigs well this year, accumulating leadership and management experience, and preparing manpower, material resources, and other conditions, it will be possible to raise 10,000, 20,000, or even more next year. This is called active preparation and steady progress, called "10 points for the indicator, 12 points for measures, and 24 points for enthusiasm." This is a good work style that is indispensable for doing any work well.

Strengthening leadership is to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Raising pigs in large numbers is a matter of universal concern to the masses. If you want to raise pigs in large numbers and well, you must also give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Countless experiences have proved that running large pig farms with thousands or tens of thousands of pigs is a good way to develop the pig industry, but it is not the only way, and it is not the main way at present. Communes can run individual experimental large pig farms, production teams and public canteens should run more small-scale pig farms, and commune members' families should raise one or two pigs according to their conditions. Production teams and public canteens raise pigs, the equipment can be simple and crude, and the feed is easy to collect locally; commune members' families raise pigs, use auxiliary labor, and collect wild feed, which can reduce the cost of pig raising. Public raising is the main factor, private raising is auxiliary, and public raising and private raising go hand in hand. This is a long-term policy for developing the pig industry, and it must be implemented into practical work. Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, currently has more than 480,000 pigs, more than double the number a year ago. The main reason for the rapid development of their pig industry is the implementation of the method of "four-level farm management and five-level pig raising." The so-called four-level farm management refers to all-people farms, commune-run farms, brigade-run farms, and team-run farms. The four-level farms raise pigs publicly, plus commune members' families raise pigs, which is five-level pig raising. Among the existing 480,000 pigs in Binhai County, 66.1% are raised collectively and 33.9% are raised by commune members. It can be seen that further and comprehensively implementing the policy of public raising as the main factor, private raising as auxiliary, and public and private raising going hand in hand, and that communes, production teams, production sub-teams, and public canteens all raise pigs within the commune, is the decisive key to the rapid development of the pig industry.

In July and August of this year, a large number of piglets were born in various places. During the midsummer, hundreds of grasses grow vigorously, and there is green feed everywhere. Pig sources and feed are available, which is a good season for vigorously developing the pig industry. We should seize this favorable opportunity, strengthen leadership, do more work, and launch a new upsurge of large-scale pig raising.

### 加强领导多做工作大养其猪

    加强领导多做工作大养其猪
    全国各地在去冬今春大规模发展养猪业以来，进展情况并不平衡。这里边的原因相当多，但最重要的一个，在于领导有没有决心，是不是细心，有没有耐心。一句话，在于领导思想和工作作风，能不能适应养猪业大发展形势的要求。
    养猪的好处多得很，难道还有人下不了大规模养猪的决心吗？有。有些同志由于没有真正搞清楚农业和养猪业的关系，所以还没有下这种决心。农业和养猪业是相互促进的。田以饲料养猪，猪以肥料养田，“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺”，这是它们统一的一面，或者说是适当地解决了两者的关系以后的结果。可是，它们还有矛盾的一面。要大量养猪，饲料问题怎样解决？建立饲料基地，粮食播种面积和饲料种植面积怎样安排？建设新的饲养场，从哪里抽调资金、材料？组织养猪专业队，怎样调配劳动力？如此等等，都是矛盾。如果被这些矛盾吓住了，如果不敢动手解决这些矛盾，就没法下大规模发展养猪业的决心。有些同志害怕妨碍农业而不敢大搞养猪业，结果，从长远的发展前途来看，恰恰削弱了农业。大家知道，肥料是庄稼的“粮食”。肥料不能满足大幅度增产的需要，是当前农业生产上一个极为尖锐的问题。而养猪积肥正是解决肥料问题的一个最有效的措施。从这个意义上说，抓养猪就是抓农业。除了某些少数民族地区以外，各地总是要“大养特养其猪”的，上面谈的那些矛盾，迟早是要解决的。迟解决不如早解决，早解决可以早得利。为了解决这个矛盾，大家都该算一笔账，作个规划，把农、牧两业加以全面的安排。没有这方面的适当的放松，就没有那方面的必要的抓紧。在农业方面挤出一些饲料地、一些劳力、资金和物力，在今年看来，似乎对农业发生了一些不利的影响；可是，到了明年，它会送给我们加倍的补偿。在这里，要紧的是不算小账，而算大账。
    为了把猪养得又多又好，光有决心还不行，还得很细心，还得扫掉官僚主义。我国是世界上养猪最早的国家，也是养猪最多的国家。但是，到解放以前，生猪最多不过几千万头，都是一家一户个别饲养。小农经济时代这种生产方式和管理方法，相沿千百年，没有多大变化。我国农村实现人民公社化以后，养猪业突飞猛进，生猪数量迅速增加，社会主义的集体饲养成为主要生产方式。这个大变化给养猪业的饲料供应、疫病防治、饲养管理提出了一系列新问题，如果不下一番苦工夫，就没法很好地解决这些问题。猪是活的，饿了要吃，病了要治，在母猪生育、小猪断乳期间，更容易发生衰瘦病死现象，所以这里容不得一点官僚主义。为什么有些地方生猪存栏数时升时降？主要原因就在于当地的领导者满足于一般的号召，不进行具体的组织工作，不了解实际情况，不及时解决各种迫切的问题，所以生猪饲养量不能稳定上升。河南临汝县生猪增长很快，他们的主要经验就是领导重视养猪业，像抓农业一样地抓养猪业。他们从县到公社、生产队，建立了一支有专职领导、专门机构、专业队伍的畜牧战线。县委有专管畜牧业的书记，各公社抽出三百多名党委委员和大队支部书记到猪场担任场长和支部书记，还抽调了一千六百多名党、团员充当饲养员。全县县、公社和生产队党组织书记中，有五百多名深入猪场，建立养猪试验田，及时发现问题，解决问题，总结经验，推广经验。三级书记下猪场，干部大搞养猪试验田，他们创造了领导生猪生产持续跃进的一条好经验。
    任何事物的发展都不是一帆风顺的。像大规模发展养猪业这种牵涉方面很广而又缺乏经验的事情，当然也是这样。起起落落的情况，最初固然难以完全避免；小幅度升升降降的可能性，在今后都是应当估计到的。因此，为了推动养猪业持续地高速度发展，不仅要有决心，很细心，还要有耐心。耐心，就是百折不回的毅力，不断革命的精神，克服一切困难的英雄气概。发展养猪业的过程，就是不断揭露矛盾、克服矛盾的过程。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会出来。没有饲料是不行的，有饲料不会喂养也不行，会喂养不会防治疫病还不行。领导要有决心抓，而且要抓到底，遇到什么问题解决什么问题，发生什么困难解决什么困难，一次不行两次，两次不行三次，如此一步不松，一着不让，持续前进，自然可以把猪养得又多又好。
    一个人养一头猪，一亩地养一头猪，这是我们的奋斗目标。应该树立这样的雄心大志，在最近几年以内，力争达到并且超过这个目标。但是，从起点到终点总有一个过程，必须经过一番艰苦、紧张的努力，才能走完这个过程。由于主客观条件不同，有些地区达到这个目标的时间要长一些，有些地方需要的时间可能短些，但不管长途旅行，还是短途散步，总是要从第一步开始的。跃进的精神一定要和实事求是的作风结合起来，把计划、指标建筑在坚实可靠的基础上。养一万头猪，要有养一万头猪的猪源、饲料、人力、场地，如果这些条件还不具备，一万头猪的指标就会成为一句空话。如果经过深入的调查研究，充分发掘了一切潜力，还是不能养一万头，那就暂时把指标降低些，一面把今天的猪养好，一面积极创造条件，以便在明天提高指标。养九千头，养得又肥又壮；养一万头，养得有的肥壮、有的瘠瘦、有的病弱，到底哪个好？当然是养九千头好。今年养好九千头，积累了领导和管理经验，准备了人力、物力等条件，明年就可能养一万头、两万头，甚至更多。这就叫作积极准备、稳步前进，叫作“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”，这是作好任何工作都少不了的好作风。
    加强领导是为了发挥群众的积极性。大量养猪是群众普遍关心的事情，要想把猪养得又多又好，也必须发挥群众的积极性。我们的目标是大家都来动手养猪。无数经验证明，办千头、万头的大型养猪场是发展养猪业的一个好办法，但它不是唯一的办法，在目前还不是主要的办法。公社可以办个别试验性的大猪场，生产队和公共食堂应该多办小规模的猪场，社员家庭应该按照条件养一两头猪。生产队和公共食堂养猪，设备可以因陋就简，饲料便于就地采集；社员家庭养猪，利用辅助劳力，采集野生饲料，更能降低养猪成本。公养为主，私养为辅，公养私养并举，是发展养猪业的长期的方针，一定要贯彻到实际工作中去。江苏滨海县现有存栏猪四十八万多头，比一年前增加两倍多。他们的养猪业发展得这样快，主要原因是实行了“四级办场、五级养猪”的办法。所谓四级办场，就是全民性的场、公社办的场、大队办的场和小队办的场。四级场公养猪，加上社员家庭养猪，就是五级养猪。在滨海县现有的四十八万多头猪当中，集体养的占66.1％，社员养的占33.9％。由此可见，进一步全面贯彻公养为主，私养为辅，公养私养并举，在公社内部公社、生产队、生产小队和公共食堂都养猪的方针，是迅速发展养猪业的决定性的关键。
    今年7、8月间，各地有大批仔猪出生。盛夏百草猛生，到处都是青饲料。猪源、饲料俱备，正是大力发展养猪业的好季节。我们应该抓紧这个有利时机，加强领导，多做工作，掀起一个大养猪的新高潮。
