　　Consult Together
　　Kong Sang
    After leading cadres go deep into the front line of production, the workers excitedly say: When leading cadres are around, problems can be discussed, difficulties can be solved, and there is no buck-passing at all. We work with full energy and feel extremely happy; we need such leaders.
    This is the workers' comment on leading cadres going deep into the front line of production. However, there are also a few leading cadres who have gone to the front line but have not yet received such comments. Since 1958, the leading cadres of the Ji'an Iron and Steel Plant have maintained the good practice of eating, living, and working with the workers, but until recently, they knew very little about the problems in production, and even when they did, they were slow to solve them. Having gone deep into the front line of production, and having achieved eating, living, and working together, why are problems not being solved significantly?
    Going deep into the front line is to better implement the mass line, but going to the front line may strengthen the mass viewpoint, implement the mass line very well, and solve problems in a timely manner; it is also possible that the mass viewpoint has not been strengthened, few problems are discovered, and problems are not solved quickly. The key here is whether we truly believe in the wisdom and creativity of the masses. Do we point fingers everywhere, are we self-righteous, and do we consider ourselves smarter than the masses? Or do we firmly believe in the masses, listen to their opinions with an open mind, and consult with the masses everywhere? In other words, have we truly established a mass viewpoint?
    First, there must be a firm mass viewpoint, and then there can be a thorough mass line. Otherwise, even if people go to the front line, even live among the masses, they are still separated from the masses, and therefore still cannot be considered to have implemented the mass line, and still cannot solve problems in a timely manner.
    Why were the problems of premature breakout of molten iron from the taphole of the blast furnace, the quality of the new blast furnace, and the hanging charge in the furnace at the Ji'an Iron and Steel Plant always unresolved in the past, but have now been readily solved? The reason is that on the basis of cadres and the masses sharing weal and woe, a new element has been added, and that is consulting together. This addition is good and important. Sharing weal and woe means eating, living, and working together; adding consulting with the masses turns the past "three togethers" into the present "four togethers." From the literal meaning, it is only one more "together." But with only three togethers and without the fourth together, the mass line is not thoroughly implemented. Because only with the addition of consulting together can we truly discover problems in production and work, and find effective ways to solve them; only with the addition of consulting together can a new situation of unity between the top and bottom, and mutual understanding, truly emerge in the enterprise. And whether cadres go to consult with the masses is decisively determined by whether cadres have a strong mass viewpoint in their thinking.
    Leading cadres go to the production front line to eat, live, and work with the masses, and consult with the masses everywhere, and they will surely be able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, obtain good comments from the workers, and make production develop forward in ever higher waves.

　　同商量
　　孔桑
    领导干部深入生产第一线后，工人们兴奋地说：领导干部在跟前，有问题就商量，有困难就解决，一点也不扯皮，干起活来浑身是劲，痛快极了；我们就需要这样的领导。
    这是工人对领导干部深入生产第一线的评语。但是，也有少数领导干部虽然到了第一线，却还没有获得这样的评语。吉安钢铁厂的领导干部从1958年以来，一直保持着和工人同吃、同住、同劳动的良好作风，可是直到最近以前，生产中的问题却了解得很少，即使了解一些，解决得也很慢。到了生产第一线，做到了同吃、同住、同劳动，为什么还不大解决问题呢？
    深入第一线，是为了更好地贯彻群众路线，但是上前线，可能加强了群众观点，群众路线贯彻得很好，解决问题很及时；也可能群众观点并没有加强，发现问题不多，解决问题不快。这里问题的关键在于是不是真正相信群众的智慧和创造力。是处处指手划脚、自以为是、把自己看得比群众高明呢？还是坚决相信群众、虚心倾听群众意见、处处和群众同商量呢？换句话说，是不是真正树立起群众观点。
    首先有坚定的群众观点，然后才可能有彻底的群众路线。否则人到第一线了，甚至生活在群众之中，和群众仍然隔着一层，因而仍然不能算是贯彻了群众路线，仍然不能及时地解决问题。
    为什么吉安钢铁厂高炉铁水过早冲出出铁口的问题，新建高炉的质量问题，炉子的悬料问题过去一直悬而未决，这次却迎刃而解了？原因就是在干部和群众同甘共苦的基础上，又增加了一个新的内容，这就是同商量。这一条加得好，加得重要。同甘共苦，就是同吃、同住、同劳动；再加上有事和群众同商量，把过去的“三同”变成现在的“四同”，从字面上看，只多了一个“同”字。但是只有三同，没有第四同，群众路线就贯彻得不彻底。因为，只有加上同商量，才能真正发现生产和工作中的问题，才能找到解决问题的有效办法；只有加上同商量，企业里才能真正出现一个上下一体，呼吸相通的新局面。而干部有没有去和群众同商量，决定性的关键又在于干部思想上有没有坚强的群众观念。
    领导干部到生产前线去和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，又处处和群众同商量，就一定能及时地发现问题和解决问题，获得工人群众的良好评语，使生产一浪高一浪地向前发展。
