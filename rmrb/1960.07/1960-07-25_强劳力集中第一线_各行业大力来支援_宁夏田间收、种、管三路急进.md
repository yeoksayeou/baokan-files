This newspaper Yinchuan, July 24th: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has concentrated a large amount of labor on the production front lines, ensuring great victories on all three fronts: summer harvesting, summer planting, and field management.

The autonomous region's agricultural activities have entered their most intense period. During this time, many counties (cities) and people's communes have adopted measures of "speeding up, suspending, replacing, supporting, and going down" to ensure that over 80% of the labor force is投入(tóurù, put in) into current production. "Speeding up" means striving to complete weeding, topdressing, and replanting preparations for rice and autumn crops before the summer harvest, to avoid various agricultural tasks being crowded together. "Suspending" means temporarily postponing non-urgent agricultural capital construction and commune-run industries, reducing manpower where possible, to gather more labor for agricultural production. "Replacing" means appropriately transferring strong laborers from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and welfare undertakings to current harvesting, planting, and management. "Supporting" means all sectors of industry, commerce, education, and the military vigorously supporting agricultural production with manpower and materials. "Going down" means cadres going to the fields,深入(shēnrù, go deep into) the production front lines, participating in production, and leading production. As a result, the manpower on the region's harvesting, planting, and management fronts has rapidly increased from 60% to 80%.

Due to the strengthening of the agricultural production front line with superior forces, all fronts of harvesting, planting, and management in the region have shown excellent situations. As of now, the Guyuan area in the south has weeded over 2.7 million mu, accounting for over 80% of the sown area of early autumn crops. Many remote mountainous areas that did not weed in the past have weeded this year. The sowing of late autumn crops in the entire area is also being intensified, and the sown area has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. The entire area has harvested 270,000多(duō, more than) mu of wheat and summer coarse grains in a timely manner. The counties (cities) in the northern Yellow River irrigation area are also taking into account harvesting, planting, and management, with most of the rice having been weeded once, and some even twice. Over 50% of spring wheat has been harvested, with more than 100,000 mu harvested daily, and the method of harvesting and replanting simultaneously is being adopted to plant small-leaf millet, buckwheat, and autumn vegetables on a large scale.

This newspaper reports that the activities of all sectors of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to support agriculture have shifted from temporary rushes to regular activities, and are closely combined with business operations, with the number of support projects also increasing daily.

Under the unified planning of the local Party committees, all sectors not only arranged regular support projects for the entire year, set goals for efforts, and strived to achieve the agricultural development program in advance from all aspects, but also closely combined with the current seasonal agricultural production to carry out support activities. In mid-May, the Autonomous Region's Agricultural Production Command requested that all counties and cities and relevant industrial and mining departments採掘(cǎijué, excavate) and rush to produce a large amount of gypsum to prepare for the early prevention and control of rice blast. By the end of June, more than 4,000 tons had been produced in various places, and most of it had been transferred. In late June, the Autonomous Region's Agricultural Production Command urgently decided to调运(diàoyùn, transfer and transport) 1.9 million jin of buckwheat and millet seeds to ten counties and cities. The transportation department immediately prioritized the transfer, which was basically completed within ten days, catching up with the needs of expanding planting and replanting. Commercial finance and financial departments also organized manpower to carry out the "investigate, deliver, help, and create" campaign, taking the initiative to understand the needs of agricultural production, helping to tap the potential of funds and合理(hélǐ, rational) use state loans, and assisting in the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools.

Because all units, large and small, in all sectors are respectively linked to communes, brigades, and teams, with division of labor and contracted responsibilities, and fixed contacts, the sense of responsibility of each unit to support agriculture has been powerfully strengthened. After the three communes and twenty-two brigades in the suburbs of Yinchuan City were linked to the autonomous region and city-level agencies, enterprises, schools, and departments, the various units supported 46,000 workdays of labor during the rice抢种(qiǎngzhòng, rush planting) in June. Various factories, schools, and hospitals also helped to establish and improve the agricultural tool repair and parts network. In fixed support and contacts, Party committees at all levels paid special attention to the support work for counties and communes with weak industrial foundations, poor teams, and remote mountainous areas. In addition to supplying more means of production in commerce, the various industrial bureaus of the autonomous region also provided comprehensive assistance and guidance to the agricultural tool factories of a commune in each of the mountainous counties. Now, the complete sets of equipment for equipping the commune agricultural tool factories have been transported to the mountainous counties by the machinery, metallurgy, coal, and transportation industrial bureaus.

    强劳力集中第一线　各行业大力来支援
    宁夏田间收、种、管三路急进
    本报银川24日电　宁夏回族自治区大批劳动力集中生产第一线，保证了夏收夏种和田间管理三条战线都取得很大胜利。
    自治区农事活动已进入了最紧张的时期，在这期间，许多县（市）和人民公社都采取“赶、停、换、援、下”的办法，保证80％以上的劳动力投入当前生产。“赶”就是争取在夏收前完成水稻、秋作物的锄草、追肥，和复种的准备工作，避免各种农活挤在一起；“停”就是把不急需的农业基本建设和社办工业暂且缓办，该减少人力的就减少人力，以便调集更多的劳动力投入农业生产；“换”就是在林、牧、副、渔以及福利事业方面，把精壮劳动力适当调到当前收、种、管方面；“援”就是工商学兵各行各业以人力、物力，大力支援农业生产；“下”就是干部下田，深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。因此，全区收、种、管三条战线的人力已迅速由60％增加到80％。
    由于以优势力量加强农业生产第一线，全区收、种、管各个战线都呈现了大好的形势。南部固原专区到目前为止，已锄草二百七十多万亩，占早秋作物播种面积的80％多。很多过去不锄草的远山地区，今年都锄了草。全专区晚秋作物的播种也正在加紧进行，播种面积已比去年同期大大增加。全专区已及时收割小麦和夏杂粮二十七万多亩。北部黄河灌区各县（市）也在收、种、管三者兼顾的前提下，大部分水稻已锄了一次草，有的还锄了两次草；春小麦已收割了50％以上，每天收割达十万多亩，并且采取边收割、边复种的办法，大种小日月糜子、荞麦和秋菜。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区各行各业支援农业活动，已由临时突击走上经常，并且和业务工作密切结合，支援的项目也日益增多。
    各行各业在当地党委的统一规划下，不但安排了全年经常的支援项目，订出努力目标，争取从各个方面提前实现农业发展纲要，而且也紧密结合当前季节农事生产，开展支援活动。5月中旬，自治区农业生产指挥部为及早防治稻瘟病作好准备，要求各县市和有关工矿部门采掘赶制大批石膏，到6月底，各地已生产出四千多吨，并已调运出一大半。6月下旬自治区农业生产指挥部紧急决定调运荞麦和糜子种一百九十万斤到十个县市，交通运输部门立即优先安排调运，十天内就基本运完，赶上了扩种、补种的需要。商业财政、金融部门也组织人力开展“查、送、帮、造”运动，主动了解农业生产需要，帮助挖掘资金潜力和合理使用国家贷款，并协助修造农具。
    由于各行各业的大大小小单位都分别和公社、大队、小队挂钩，分工包干，固定联系，有力地加强了各单位支援农业的责任感。银川市郊三个公社二十二个大队，同自治区和市级机关、企业、学校、部门分别挂钩后，在6月抢种水稻时，各单位就支援了劳力四万六千多工日，各工厂、学校、医院还纷纷帮助建立与健全了农具修配网。在固定支援联系中，各级党委特别注意对工业基础薄弱的县、社和穷队、偏僻山区的支援工作。对山区各县除在商业上多供应生产资料外，还由自治区各工业局分别给予一个公社农具厂以全面协助和辅导。现在，机械、冶金、煤炭、交通等工业局已分别将装备公社农具厂的全套设备运送到山区各县。
