Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd. The opening ceremony of the performance by the Afghan Royal Music and Song Troupe, invited to visit and perform in our country, was held at the Capital Theater tonight.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the opening ceremony and enjoyed the wonderful performances and singing of the Afghan artists.

　　Also present at the opening ceremony were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, Chinese Ambassador to the Kingdom of Afghanistan Hao Ting, Vice Chairmen of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, Zhang Zhixiang, and Ding Xilin, and people from the capital's music circles.

　　Afghan Ambassador to China Abdul Samad and diplomatic officials from the embassy attended the opening ceremony.

　　At the opening ceremony, Ding Xilin delivered a speech, warmly welcoming the Afghan Royal Music and Song Troupe to visit and perform in our country. He first highly praised the heroic and hardworking Afghan people for creating rich and colorful music and singing art in the long years. He said: The Chinese and Afghan people have had friendly relations for thousands of years, and there have been friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges in remote ages. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Afghanistan in 1955, especially after the mutual visits between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Daud in 1957, the traditional friendship between the two peoples has been further consolidated and developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit. The consolidation and development of friendship between China and Afghanistan not only conforms to the interests of the two peoples, but also helps to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

　　Abdul Burishna, head of the Afghan Music and Song Troupe, said that Afghanistan and China have had cultural exchanges since the twelfth century. He said: "Our people like to listen to Chinese music because Chinese music is not unfamiliar to us, and we also hope that you like our folk music." He wished the cultural exchanges between Afghanistan and China would continue to flourish, and the friendship between the two countries would grow stronger day by day.

　　During the intermission of the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi received the leaders and all members of the Afghan Royal Music and Song Troupe and had a cordial conversation with them. Premier Zhou thanked the Afghan folk artists for coming to our country for a visit and performance from afar.

　　The program performed by the Afghan Royal Music and Song Troupe tonight included instrumental music with rich national flavor, beautiful folk songs, and singing "Xinjiang is Good" in Chinese. These wonderful programs won warm applause from the audience.

　　After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi and others went on stage and shook hands with the members one by one, congratulating them on the success of the performance.

　　Also invited to attend the opening ceremony and enjoy the performance tonight were diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China.
