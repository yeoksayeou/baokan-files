    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Tokyo: Approximately ten thousand workers held a rally in Tokyo today, declaring their non-recognition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; demanding the abrogation of this Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the establishment of a peace-loving government pursuing a neutral policy.
    The rally passed a resolution demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet and a substantial increase in wages for government employees.
    The resolution opposed the plan by Mitsui Mining Company to dismiss union activists at the Miike Coal Mine, and protested against the government's suppression of participants in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.
    The resolution stated that workers in the public utilities sector will strengthen their struggle to win workers' basic rights.
    The rally also passed a declaration stating that the workers would fight to achieve the aforementioned demands.
    After the meeting, the workers, disregarding the scorching sun, held a demonstration march in the city.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Tokyo: Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, called on people in various parts of Japan to follow the example of the Gunma Prefecture Citizens' Alliance for the Defense of Democracy in developing the more than two thousand joint struggle organizations against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that have already been established across the country.
    Nosaka issued this call on the 23rd in Takasaki City while giving a speech supporting the joint candidate of democratic forces in the Gunma Prefecture gubernatorial election. The joint candidate of democratic forces is Giheiji Tsunoda, chairman of the Gunma Prefecture Citizens' Alliance for the Defense of Democracy.
    In his speech, Nosaka highly praised the anti-"Security Treaty" struggle of the people of Gunma Prefecture over the past year. He said that the Gunma Prefecture Citizens' Alliance for the Defense of Democracy currently has 130 branches throughout the prefecture, bringing together the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and broad masses of people from all strata of society centered on the working class. It is one of the most advanced organizations in the country's joint struggle organizations.
    Nosaka pointed out that the current Gunma Prefecture gubernatorial election is the first election after the establishment of the Ikeda Cabinet, and therefore it has received widespread attention.
    Nosaka called on those attending the meeting to actively launch activities to strive for the victory of the democratic forces' candidate in the gubernatorial election.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Tokyo: The Japanese people are actively preparing for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled to open in Tokyo on August 2nd.
    The initiating organization of this conference, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, is vigorously carrying out propaganda activities. It has already sold 80,000 copies of materials and cartoons related to the World Conference and distributed millions of leaflets and other printed materials throughout the country. The council is also actively launching fundraising campaigns in various places to raise funds for the conference.
    In Osaka, the local Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has sold more than 200,000 commemorative badges, raising funds to send more than 500 delegates to Tokyo to participate in the conference. People in various districts of Osaka are holding and will hold multiple discussion meetings for this conference. High school students have formed a working committee and are preparing to send students to Tokyo to participate in the conference.
    The people of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost region, are preparing to link many peace-keeping gatherings with the World Conference in Tokyo. Hokkaido will send 1,000 delegates to Tokyo to participate in the World Conference, an increase of 200 delegates from the original plan. In addition, 25 of the 27 cities in Hokkaido will hold city-wide gatherings, and one-third of the 158 towns and villages in Hokkaido will hold gatherings as part of the August movement against nuclear weapons and for disarmament.
