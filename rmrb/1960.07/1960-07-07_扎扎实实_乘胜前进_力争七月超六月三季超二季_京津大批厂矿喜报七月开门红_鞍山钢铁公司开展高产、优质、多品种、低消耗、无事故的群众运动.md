Xinhua News Agency, July 6th, Beijing: The vast number of workers on Beijing's industrial front, after entering the third quarter, have firmly grasped the two key aspects of promoting advanced technology and improving enterprise management, using even greater efforts to improve product quality, increase variety, increase production, and save raw materials and materials, striving for July to surpass June, and the third quarter to surpass the second. They are fighting to comprehensively overfulfill the annual plan.

    Entering July, reports of high yield and high quality have been continuously coming from many factories. Steelworkers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are vigorously engaged in a one-stop collaboration competition. There is close cooperation between processes and between shifts. The average daily steel production in the first four days increased by 8.6% compared with the average daily production in June, and the qualified rate of steel reached 99.5%. The Datang Coal Mine and Mentougou Coal Mine vigorously promoted advanced experience, and both overfulfilled the coal production plan from the 1st to the 3rd. Workers at the Liulihe Cement Plant check the completion of output and quality every day and every shift. The cement produced in the first five days increased by more than 100 tons compared with the last five days of June, and the quality all met the planned requirements. Workers at the Beijing Civil Lighting Factory are paying attention to quality at every level. In the first four days, they achieved high quality and high output every day. The production of industrial lamps such as mining lamps, safety lamps, and searchlights that were put into storage in the four days increased sharply by 79% compared with the same period last month, and the product quality all met the specifications.
    Since the beginning of this year, Beijing's industrial production has been developing wave after wave. Under this excellent situation, the vast number of workers are aiming to achieve high quality, high efficiency, multiple varieties, low consumption, and a greater, faster, better, and more economical comprehensive leap forward. They are pushing the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new stage of great popularization, great improvement, and large-scale harvest. All units, based on a series of new changes in production after the large-scale adoption of new equipment, new technologies, and new techniques, have boldly mobilized the masses to strengthen technical management and planning management.
    In response to the greater need for raw materials and materials due to the rapid increase in production, all units have widely opened up sources of raw materials and materials, and great achievements have been made in metallurgy, chemical industry, building materials, and textiles. After improving the design of products such as automobile headlights and oil seals in the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory, it can save more than 600 tons of steel and more than 100 tons of non-ferrous metals a year.
    Beijing Railway transportation workers have intensified the transportation of key materials such as ore, coal, and limestone to ensure sufficient "food and grass" reserves for steel production. According to statistics, more than 20,000 tons of limestone alone can be stored before the rainy season. Other transportation departments have also vowed to guarantee high output with high transportation, vigorously carrying out pre-rainy season transportation, and actively preparing for rainy season transportation.
    Heatstroke prevention, cooling, dust removal, and safe production are also important tasks for all units. They have taken many effective measures to overcome the impact of heat and rainy season on production.

    In the booming production upsurge, leading cadres at all levels in various units have gone deep into the front line of production, on the one hand, to further mobilize the masses, and on the other hand, to solve the key problems in production in a down-to-earth manner, comprehensively arrange the production, study, and life of workers, and ensure a continuous great leap forward.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 6th: On the basis of the comprehensive leap forward in production in the first half of the year, the industrial front in Tianjin is advancing victoriously, grasping the third quarter production firmly and carefully, striving for the third quarter to surpass the second quarter, and July to surpass June. In the first three days of July, according to incomplete statistics, more than 200 factories in the city completed their production plans and achieved a good start in the third quarter.

    In order to ensure a sustained leap forward in the third quarter, the city's industrial front, on the one hand, thoroughly implements the idea of agriculture as the foundation, strengthens industrial support for agriculture's drought resistance and agricultural technology transformation, and on the other hand, takes steel as the key, strives to improve product quality and increase varieties, and ensures that all major products achieve high quality and high output in the third quarter. A vigorous mass movement of learning, catching up, surpassing, and creating advanced national indicators has been launched throughout the city. In this movement, the vast number of workers and cadres are full of confidence and strive for five firsts: quality first, output first, consumption reduction first, trial production and putting into production of high-precision and cutting-edge products first, and safety and hygiene first. In order to prepare sufficient food and grass for industrial production, the city has formulated measures to vigorously grasp the increased production and savings of fourteen major raw materials, materials, and fuels, and guide the main direction of technical innovation and technical revolution to vigorously increase the production of raw materials and materials, promote new technologies and new techniques, reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials, and vigorously develop comprehensive utilization. Now, all walks of life are formulating specific measures to improve product quality and ensure continued substantial increases in production according to systems and factories. Workers in the light industry system have launched a movement to learn from famous brands, catch up with famous brands, and create famous brands, classify and rank all products, and formulate specific plans to improve product quality in the third quarter. The machinery and electrical industries require a major revolution in all mechanical and electrical products in the third quarter, striving to increase output and quality without increasing manpower and raw materials. Many factories in the textile industry have adopted the method of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously build satellite factories and workshops for man-made fibers and wild fibers, and widely explore sources of raw materials.
    During the battle for the third quarter, leading cadres of all factories in the city further improved their leadership style. More than 90% of the factory party secretaries and directors have gone deep into the front line of production to lead production meticulously and conscientiously. Many leading cadres have also gone deep into workshops and groups to set up camp and settle down, and timely solve key production problems and break through weak links. In order to achieve high furnace age and high steel production in the third quarter, Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant established a front-line production command group headed by the party secretary on July 1st, mobilized the masses to summarize experience, and formulated a new set of operating methods from furnace construction, iron smelting to steelmaking. On July 2nd, a five-ton converter broke through the 100-furnace mark and produced 101 furnaces of steel, creating the highest furnace age record in the city's history. The leading cadres and workers of the No. 4 Steel Plant fought together, focusing on improving the desulfurization efficiency of the iron smelting furnace and other key productions, and extensively carried out the competition of "learning from No. 3 Steel Plant and surpassing No. 3 Steel Plant," and also created a higher record of 118 furnaces on the 5th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 6th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) Party Committee held a meeting of party members and cadres on the 4th to summarize the work in the second quarter and deploy the tasks for the third quarter. The meeting decided to immediately launch a deep and lasting mass movement of high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low consumption, and no accidents on all fronts of Angang, to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in all departments and indicators in the third quarter.

    As a result of the efforts of all Angang workers in the second quarter, the output of major products such as steel, steel materials, and pig iron all increased compared with the first quarter, thereby achieving a huge victory in overfulfilling half of the annual plan for steel and steel materials in the first half of the year. Angang's production in the third quarter should have a greater leap forward than in the second quarter, and it requires arduous efforts to complete the production plan. However, the Angang Party Committee pointed out that as long as twelve measures are taken, and they are grasped tightly, thoroughly, carefully, and practically, the third quarter's production can definitely be pushed to a higher level, and a comprehensive leap forward of high speed and high targets can be achieved more successfully.

    Based on the work experience in the first half of the year and the main problems existing currently, the meeting proposed that in order to ensure the completion of the third quarter's task, it is necessary to focus on six measures: ideological revolution, technological revolution, production measures, strengthening enterprise management, strengthening grassroots work, and caring for workers' lives.
    The meeting proposed that the general policy of Angang's technological innovation and technological revolution in the third quarter is: closely combining with the key of production, taking "four modernizations" as the center, vigorously creating and implementing new smelting technology routes, vigorously developing comprehensive utilization, and grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, marching towards high speed and high targets. At present, the entire company must first concentrate its efforts to improve the technological revolution in the two most important links of steelmaking and mineral processing, so that the production of steel and concentrate can leap forward, paving the way for the comprehensive and substantial growth of Angang's production. In the arrangement of technical measures, human and material resources should be used in the most urgent places, first focusing on the weak link of smelting fuel and key measures to directly protect steel and pig iron. In order to ensure the comprehensive leap forward of production, all departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of a unified game of chess, and truly serve the lower factories, auxiliary departments should serve the main departments, and all factories should actively strengthen contact and cooperation, and actively support weak links. Mines, sintering, coking, and ironmaking factories should improve the quality of raw materials while increasing output, and steelmaking and steel rolling factories should strictly guarantee the types of steel and steel materials.

    The Angang Party Committee particularly emphasized strengthening the work of grassroots party organizations. The Party Committee requires party organizations in all factories and mines to focus on the grassroots work of the party, timely summarize the work experience of party branches and party groups, and every party member must set an example in leading the masses to do a good job in the current production.
