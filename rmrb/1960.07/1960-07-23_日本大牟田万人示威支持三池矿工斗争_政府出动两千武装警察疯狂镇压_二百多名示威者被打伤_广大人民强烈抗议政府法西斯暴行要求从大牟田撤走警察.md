Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government's police injured over two hundred demonstrating workers and students in Omuta City, southern Japan, today, creating yet another bloody tragedy.

This morning, ten thousand workers and students from all over the country held a massive rally in Omuta City, resolutely supporting the long-term struggle of the Miike coal miners in this city against mass layoffs. After the meeting, all participants held a demonstration march in the city.

Because the police unreasonably arrested three demonstrating trade union members, the demonstrating masses held a protest demonstration in front of the Omuta City Police Station. Subsequently, the government authorities dispatched two thousand armed police equipped with armored vehicles to brutally beat the demonstrating workers and students. According to the Miike Coal Miners' Union, a total of two hundred and thirteen demonstrators were injured, forty-eight of whom suffered serious injuries. In addition, twenty-three students and eight trade union members were illegally arrested.

This fascist atrocity by the Japanese government has aroused strong indignation among the Japanese people. The Japan Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the Japan Coal Miners' Union sent representatives to the Metropolitan Police Department this afternoon to protest and demand the immediate withdrawal of police from Omuta.

Miike Coal Miners' Union Chairman Mutsuo Miyagawa, Japan Coal Miners' Union Vice-Chairman Kazuma Noguchi, and General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Deputy Secretary-General Takehiro Ebitani also lodged a serious protest with the Fukuoka Prefectural Police Headquarters. They pointed out that this bloody incident was caused by police provocation. They demanded the immediate release of the arrested students and trade union members.

Miike Coal Mine, one of the largest coal mines in Japan belonging to the Mitsui Zaibatsu, has become the focal point of Japanese workers' struggle against the capitalists' "enterprise rationalization" policy. Since the Mitsui Mining Company announced its intention to lay off more than 2,200 workers last year, the workers and their families at Miike Coal Mine have been heroically persisting in their struggle. Capitalists and police have repeatedly used bloody suppression and division, and other despicable means, but have failed to subdue the workers. On the contrary, the workers are fighting stronger and stronger. Their struggle to defend their livelihoods and democratic rights has received increasingly widespread support from people all over the country. The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and mass organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan have all sent support personnel to support the workers' just struggle.

    政府出动两千武装警察疯狂镇压　二百多名示威者被打伤
    广大人民强烈抗议政府法西斯暴行要求从大牟田撤走警察
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本政府的警察今天在日本南部的大牟田市打伤了二百多名示威工人和学生，制造了又一起流血大惨案。
    今天上午，来自全国各地的工人和学生一万人在大牟田市举行声势浩大的群众大会，坚决支持这个城市的三池煤矿工人反对大批解雇而进行的长期斗争。大会结束后，全体与会者在市内举行了示威游行。
    由于警察无理逮捕了三名示威的工会会员，示威群众在大牟田市警察署前面举行了抗议示威。接着，政府当局出动了两千名配备着装甲车的武装警察野蛮地殴打示威工人和学生。据三池煤矿工会宣布共有二百一十三名示威者被打伤，其中四十八人遭受重伤。另外，还有二十三名学生和八名工会会员被非法逮捕。
    日本政府这种法西斯暴行激起了日本人民强烈的愤慨。日本社会党、日本工会总评议会、日本煤矿工会今天下午都派代表向警视厅提出了抗议，并且要求立即从大牟田撤走警察。
    三池煤矿工会主席宫川睦男、日本煤矿工会副委员长野口一马和日本工会总评议会副事务局长蛯谷武弘等还向福冈县警察本部提出严重抗议。他们指出：这次流血事件是警察的挑衅引起的。他们要求立即释放被捕的学生和工会会员。
    属于三井财阀的日本最大煤矿之一的三池煤矿已经成为日本工人同资本家的“企业合理化”政策斗争的焦点。三池煤矿的工人和家属们自从去年三井矿山公司宣布要解雇二千二百多名工人以后，一直在英勇地坚持斗争。资本家和警察一再用血腥镇压和分化等各种卑鄙手段，都没有使工人屈服，相反地工人越战越强。他们保卫生活和民主权利的斗争得到了全国各地人民越来越广泛的支持。日本共产党、社会党以及日本工会总评议会等群众团体都派遣支援人员，支持工人的正义斗争。
