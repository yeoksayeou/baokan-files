    Imperialism Persists in Interfering in the Congo
    Herter Publicly Claims the Congolese Prime Minister Does Not Represent the Congolese People
    Belgian Prime Minister Shouts He Has No Intention of Withdrawing the Aggressor Troops in the Congo

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: U.S. Secretary of State Herter blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of the Congo at a press conference on the 21st, publicly claiming that the leaders of the Congolese government do not represent the Congolese people. His remarks once again fully exposed the malicious intentions of the United States to try every means to send its own personnel to infiltrate the Congo and vigorously transport United Nations troops to the Congo.
    In answering questions, Herter believed that whether what Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba said could represent the general wishes of the Congolese people "is difficult to be certain." He said: "It is difficult for us to estimate whether they are speaking on behalf of the vast majority of their own people."
    At the beginning of the press conference, Herter specifically issued a pre-prepared statement on the situation in the Congo. In the statement, he said that the situation in the Congo "affects our interests." From July 14th to yesterday, the United States has transported 3,500 United Nations troops and 300 tons of equipment to the Congo, and this work is "proceeding day and night." By the end of this week, another 2,000 troops and 100 tons of equipment will be transported in.
    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 23rd: Belgian Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens reiterated on the 22nd that the Belgian government has no intention of withdrawing the Belgian aggressor troops in the Congo.
    He told reporters that Belgian troops will continue to remain in the Congo "wherever needed." He announced that he had never issued any order to Belgian troops to cease their actions in the Congo.
    Eyskens said this after the United Nations Security Council once again passed a resolution on the 21st calling for Belgium to withdraw its troops.
    When a reporter asked Belgian Defense Minister Gilson whether the resolution passed by the United Nations meant that Belgian troops should withdraw from their bases in the Congo, Gilson said: "It doesn't seem so." An Associated Press dispatch from Brussels on the same day also promoted the Belgian government's view on the Security Council resolution with ulterior motives. The message emphasized that Belgian government officials believe that the United Nations Security Council resolution did not mention the complete withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo.

    帝国主义坚持干涉刚果
    赫脱公然声称刚果总理不代表刚果人民
    比首相叫喊不打算撤退在刚果的侵略军
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱21日在记者招待会上露骨干涉刚果内政，公然声称刚果政府领导人不代表刚果人民。他的这番话再一次充分暴露了美国千方百计派遣自己的人员渗入刚果并大力运输联合国部队去刚果的恶毒用心。
    赫脱在回答问题时认为，刚果总理卢蒙巴所说的话能否代表刚果人民的普遍愿望“是很难肯定的”，他说：“我们很难估计他们是否代表他们自己的绝大多数的人民说话”。
    在记者招待会开始时，赫脱特地就刚果局势发表了一项事先准备好的声明。他在声明中说，刚果的局势是“对我们的利益有影响的”。从7月14日开始到昨天为止，美国已经向刚果运输了三千五百名联合国部队和三百吨装备，而且这种工作“正在夜以继日地进行着”。到本周末，将再运进两千名军队和一百吨装备。
    新华社23日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时首相加斯东·伊斯更斯22日再次声明，比利时政府丝毫不打算撤退比利时在刚果的侵略军。
    他对记者们说，比利时军队将继续留在刚果“任何有需要的地方”。他宣布，他从来没有下过任何命令要比利时军队停止他们在刚果的行动。
    伊斯更斯是在联合国安全理事会21日又一次通过要比利时撤军的决议以后这样说的。
    有记者问比利时国防大臣纪耳松，联合国通过的这项决议是否意味着比利时军队应当从他们在刚果的基地撤走，纪耳松说：“看来不是这样。”美联社同一天从布鲁塞尔发出的一条消息也别有用心地宣传比利时政府人士对安理会决议的看法。这条消息强调指出，比利时政府人士认为，联合国安全理事会决议并没有提到从刚果全部撤退比利时军队的问题。
