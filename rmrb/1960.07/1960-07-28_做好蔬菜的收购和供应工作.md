Do a Good Job in the Purchase and Supply of Vegetables

Currently, all localities are vigorously promoting vegetable production, and growing vegetables has become a mass movement of urban and rural people, with an unprecedentedly good situation. Commercial departments must seize this favorable opportunity to do a good job in the purchase and supply of vegetables, promote the further development of vegetable production, and better arrange the non-staple food market. In the current upsurge of all walks of life supporting agriculture, in addition to supporting the development of vegetable production from technical, equipment, material, and financial aspects, commercial departments must send purchasing personnel to the urban and rural people's communes that grow vegetables, participate in production, help the communes complete the autumn vegetable planting plan, help the communes manage vegetable fields and solve the specific problems that exist currently. After the harvest, they must also help the urban and rural people's communes do a good job in the storage and processing of autumn vegetables, as well as the organized and planned sale of vegetables. In short, commercial departments must wholeheartedly support vegetable production from beginning to end.

Developing vegetable production is the foundation for doing a good job in purchasing work, and doing a good job in purchasing work can promote better development of production. Conversely, if the purchasing work is not done well, it will directly affect the development of production. How can we ensure that purchasing work has a positive impact on production? The Shanghai Liuliqiao Vegetable Wholesale Station provides a good experience. This wholesale station treats vegetable production as its own task and actively participates in production. Whatever production requires, the wholesale station actively participates as long as it is possible. When people's communes encounter difficulties in vegetable production, the wholesale station treats these difficulties as its own and tries every means to help solve them. This wholesale station's approach is not only welcomed by the people's communes but also greatly benefits the wholesale station's work. Because the personnel of the wholesale station actively participate in production, they are well aware of the labor and vegetable field arrangements in vegetable production, as well as the sowing and growth of various vegetables. This makes it possible to help the communes properly arrange production according to the market needs of each period, and to organize purchasing and marketing according to the production situation of each period. What is particularly important is that while helping the communes arrange the production of commodity vegetables, they also help rural public canteens grow their own vegetables. When the lives of commune members are well arranged, their enthusiasm for production is even greater. At the same time, with self-sufficiency in vegetables well arranged, commodity vegetables are even more guaranteed. Because commercial personnel think about production everywhere, the relationship between agriculture and commerce is as harmonious as fish and water. As a result, vegetable production has developed, and the vegetable wholesale station has also excellently completed its own purchasing tasks, providing the market with more vegetables of good quality and variety.

With the development of vegetable production and an ample supply of goods, this does not mean that the supply work is done well. A good way to do a good job in the supply of the vegetable market is to rationally allocate commodities. Socialist planned production requires planned consumption. The rational allocation of commodities is a method of planned consumption. In terms of the quantity of supply, it is necessary to arrange for the needs of cities and also for the needs of rural self-consumption and use as feed. In terms of the variety of supply, when a certain vegetable is in its peak production season and is available in large quantities, various methods should be adopted to guide consumption and expand supply, acting as a "consultant" for the people's lives. For vegetables that the masses universally love but cannot be fully satisfied for the time being, especially when the market supply of a certain vegetable is small, it is necessary to ensure the basic needs of the masses and also meet some special needs, and to arrange for the consumption needs of collective units (such as mess halls and public canteens) as well as the individual consumption needs of ordinary residents. Commercial departments should not only rationally allocate commodities but also continuously improve supply methods. For example, by reflecting consumers' opinions and requirements on the quantity, variety, and quality of vegetables, they can promote production and make the vegetable supply increasingly abundant, better meeting consumers' needs. At the same time, they can also use various forms to introduce to consumers how to cook and eat vegetables, so that the consumption of various vegetables can be adapted to production. In these aspects, the experience of the Shanghai Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market is also available for reference and learning in various places.

Because vegetables are a non-staple food needed by the people every day and are currently the most important non-staple food, doing a good job in the purchase and supply of vegetables is not only an economic task but also a political task of arranging the people's lives. In order to better complete this task, it is necessary to constantly conduct full political and ideological work for employees in commercial departments, improve their policy level, firmly establish political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, fully utilize revolutionary initiative and creativity, and, like the employees of the Shanghai Liuliqiao Vegetable Wholesale Station and the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market, think about production and consumption everywhere, actively and proactively go deep into production and the lives of the masses, and not only do their own business work well but also strive to do some "extra" things. In this way, they can gain the deep trust and active support of the masses and can constantly improve and improve the supply of vegetables based on the opinions of the masses, making themselves truly assistants of the Party's comprehensive organization of the people's economic life. Every commercial person must also learn to do ideological work, combine it with business activities, and regularly conduct policy and ideological publicity to producers and consumers based on the production and supply of vegetables in each period, so that the three aspects of production, supply, and consumption can be twisted into one rope on the basis of continuous improvement in political thought. In this way, the purchase and supply of vegetables will definitely be done better and better.

### 做好蔬菜的收购和供应工作

    做好蔬菜的收购和供应工作
    目前，各地正在大抓特抓蔬菜生产，种菜已成为城乡人民的群众运动，形势空前地好。商业部门一定要抓住这一有利时机，做好蔬菜的收购和供应工作，促进蔬菜生产进一步发展，把副食品市场安排得更好。在目前各行各业支援农业的高潮中，商业部门除了必须从技术、设备、物资、资金等方面支持蔬菜生产的发展外，更重要的是，应该把采购人员派到种菜的城乡人民公社，参与生产，帮助公社完成秋菜种植计划，帮助公社做好菜田管理和解决当前存在的具体问题；在收获以后，还要帮助城乡人民公社做好秋菜的储藏加工工作，以及有组织有计划地出售蔬菜。总之，商业部门必须自始至终地全力支持蔬菜生产。
    发展蔬菜生产是做好收购工作的基础，收购工作做好了，可以促进生产更好地发展。反之，如果收购工作搞得不好，就会直接影响到生产的发展。怎样才能做到使收购工作对生产发生积极影响呢？上海市六里桥蔬菜批发站提供了一个好经验。这个批发站把蔬菜生产看作自己的任务一样，积极参与生产。生产上要求做什么，只要有可能，批发站就积极参加；人民公社在蔬菜生产上发生了一些困难，批发站把这些困难当作自己的困难一样，千方百计地帮助解决。这个批发站这样做了，不仅受到人民公社的欢迎，也大大有利于批发站的工作。由于批发站的人员积极参与生产，他们对蔬菜生产中劳力和菜田的安排、各种蔬菜的播种和生长情况便了如指掌；这样就有可能根据每个时期的市场需要，帮助公社妥善安排生产；就有可能根据每个时期的生产情况，组织收购上市。特别重要的是，他们在帮助公社安排好商品蔬菜生产的同时，还帮助农村公共食堂种好自己吃的菜。社员的生活安排得好，生产的热情也就更高。同时，自给菜安排好了，商品菜也就更有保障。由于商业人员处处为生产着想，农商关系如鱼和水一样的融洽。结果是蔬菜生产发展了，蔬菜批发站也出色地完成了本身的收购任务，为市场提供了更多的质量好、品种多的蔬菜。
    蔬菜生产发展了，有了充沛的货源，但这并不等于供应工作就做好了。要做好蔬菜市场的供应工作，一个好办法是合理分配商品。社会主义的计划生产要求有计划的消费。合理分配商品就是计划消费的一个方法。在供应的数量上，既要安排好城市的需要，又要安排好农村自食和用作饲料的需要。在供应品种上，某种蔬菜生产旺季，大量上市的时候，要采取多样的方法去指导消费，扩大供应，当好群众生活上的“参谋”。对群众普遍喜爱而一时不能充分满足需要的蔬菜，尤其是某种蔬菜上市量较少的时候，要做到既保证群众的基本需要，又满足部分特殊需要；既要安排好集体单位的消费需要（如伙食团、公共食堂等）又要安排好一般居民的个体消费需要。商业部门不但要合理分配商品，还要不断改进供应方法。如通过反映消费者对蔬菜数量、品种、质量等方面的意见和要求，来促进生产，使蔬菜供应越来越丰富，更好地满足消费者的需要；同时也可以运用各种形式，向消费者介绍蔬菜的作法、吃法，使各种蔬菜的消费，能和生产相适应。在这些方面，上海三角地菜场的经验，也是可供各地参考学习的。
    由于蔬菜是人民群众每天需要的副食品，是当前最重要的副食品，因此做好蔬菜的收购和供应工作，不但是一个经济工作，也是一个安排好人民生活的政治任务。为了更好地完成这个任务，必须经常对商业部门职工进行充分的政治思想工作，提高他们的政策水平，牢固地树立政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，充分发挥革命的积极性和创造性，像上海六里桥蔬菜批发站和三角地菜场的职工那样，处处为生产、为消费着想，积极主动地深入到生产中去、群众生活中去，不但要做好本身的业务工作，而且还要努力做好一些“份外”的事情，这样就能取得群众的深厚信任和积极支持，并且有可能根据群众的意见，不断地改进和提高蔬菜的供应工作，使自己真正成为党的全面组织人民经济生活的助手。每个商业人员，还要学会做思想工作，结合业务活动，根据每个时期蔬菜的生产和供应情况，经常向生产者和消费者进行政策思想的宣传，使产、供、消三方面在政治思想不断提高的基础上拧成一股绳，这样，蔬菜的收购和供应工作就一定能愈做愈好。
