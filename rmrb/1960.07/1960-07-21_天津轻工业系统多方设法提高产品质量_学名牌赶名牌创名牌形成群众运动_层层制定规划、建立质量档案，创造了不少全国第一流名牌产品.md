Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 20th: The workers in Tianjin's light industry system are carrying out a mass movement to learn from famous brands, catch up with famous brands, and create famous brands, striving to improve the quality of light industrial products, so that many products have caught up with famous brands in Shanghai and other places, and have created many national first-class famous brand products.

Since the beginning of this year, while continuously making great leaps forward in production, Tianjin's light industry workers have further established the idea of ​​quality first, using the production of more and better products to ensure the continued great leap forward in production and meet the growing needs of the people. When formulating production plans at the beginning of the year, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Light Industry listed the plan to improve product quality as an important part, and in conjunction with the movement to learn from famous brands, catch up with famous brands, and create famous brands, formulated plans for learning, catching up, and creating famous brands at all levels, establishing the improvement of product quality on a solid and reliable and active and advanced foundation. The city's light industry system has achieved good results because it has adopted a three-level checking system, that is, the Municipal Bureau of Light Industry, its affiliated companies, and factories each formulate plans to improve product quality and specific measures to catch up with famous brand products. In the first half of this year, fifty kinds of products, including black and white film, sports shoes, basketballs, and bicycles, reached or exceeded the quality of famous brand products. Among them, the quality of cowhide sole leather, typing stencil paper, carbon stencil paper, and high and low parallel bars has reached the national first-class level. Now, from the Bureau of Light Industry to various factories, they have formulated a plan for the third quarter to learn from famous brands, catch up with famous brands, and create famous brands to improve product quality, striving to make the other fifty-nine kinds of products that were originally scheduled to reach or exceed the advanced level this year all reach or exceed the quality standards of famous brand products in the third quarter.

The mass movement of "learning from famous brands, catching up with famous brands, and creating famous brands" has maximized the enthusiasm of the workers to improve product quality. Under this battle cry, many factory workers have shown their greatest wisdom and energy. The "July 1st" gold pen produced by the Tianjin Pen Factory was originally of poor quality. The workers took the domestic first-class Shanghai "Hero" gold pen as the object of learning and catching up, studied and analyzed the advantages of the Hero gold pen, and formulated specific plans and measures to improve the quality of the "July 1st" gold pen. After several months of hard work, the "July 1st" gold pen has basically reached the level of the "Hero No. 100" in terms of water leakage temperature difference, continuous writing, smooth nib, and water absorption. After the Tianjin Winery proposed the goal of learning and catching up with the eight famous wines in the country, it sent special personnel to the famous Shaanxi Xifeng Winery and Shanxi Xinghuacun Winery to learn from their experience. They promoted the advanced experience of these factories and have enabled Zhigu sorghum wine to reach the level of "Xifeng" wine.

In the movement to learn, catch up, and create famous brands, many factories have established a product quality archive system. This is a very effective measure to conscientiously implement the quality plan and ensure the continuous improvement of product quality. The "quality archive" includes the quality standards of each product, the quality analysis record of the catch-up object, the written materials and physical materials of the monthly product quality analysis and inspection, the product quality appraisal certificate, and the opinions of trade departments and consumers. With product quality archive data, it is easy to assess, analyze and compare product quality, and problems can be solved in a timely manner after they are discovered. After the Tianjin Tannery established a quality archive for cowhide grain leather, it analyzed and studied the product once a month, compared it with the catch-up object, and compared it with the quality data of the previous month and the previous months, so as to grasp the quality changes in a timely manner and take new measures at any time to improve product quality. Due to these measures, the factory made the quality indicators such as chromium content, oil content, tensile strength, and elongation of the cowhide grain leather all reach or exceed the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry in a very short time, becoming a national first-class product. In May, they also ensured that the cowhide grain leather did not fade when rubbed dry or wet, and the product quality was further improved.

    天津轻工业系统多方设法提高产品质量
    学名牌赶名牌创名牌形成群众运动
    层层制定规划、建立质量档案，创造了不少全国第一流名牌产品
    新华社天津20日电　天津市轻工业系统职工开展学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的群众运动，努力提高轻工业产品质量，使许多产品赶上了上海等地的名牌货，并且创造了不少全国第一流的名牌产品。
    今年以来，天津市轻工业职工在生产持续跃进的同时，进一步树立了质量第一的思想，用生产更多更好的产品，保证生产的持续跃进，满足人民日益增长的需要。在年初制订生产规划的时候，天津市轻工业局就把提高产品质量的规划列为一项重要内容，并且结合学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌运动，层层制订学、赶、创名牌的规划，把提高产品质量建立在切实可靠而又积极先进的基础上。全市轻工业系统由于采取了三级把关的办法，即轻工业局、局属各公司和工厂三级分别制订提高产品质量的规划和赶名牌产品的具体措施，因此收到了很好的效果。今年上半年，全市就有黑白电影胶片、运动鞋、篮球、自行车等五十种产品，达到或超过了名牌产品的质量。其中，牛底革、打字腊纸、复写腊纸和高低杠等产品的质量，已经达到了全国第一流。现在，从轻工业局到各个工厂，又制订了第三季度的学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的提高产品质量规划，力争使原订在今年内要达到或超过先进水平的另外五十九种产品，全部提前在第三季度内达到或超过名牌产品的质量标准。
    “学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌”的群众运动，最大限度地调动了职工群众提高产品质量的积极性。在这一战斗口号下，不少工厂职工都表现出了最大的智慧和干劲。天津制笔厂生产的“七一”金笔，原来质量较差。工人们把国内第一流的上海“英雄”金笔作为学、赶对象，研究和分析了英雄金笔的优点，制订了提高“七一”金笔质量的具体规划和措施，经过几个月的奋战，现在“七一”金笔在漏水温差、连续书写、笔尖圆滑、吸水量等方面，都已经基本上达到了“英雄一百号”的水平。天津酿酒厂提出学、赶全国八大名酒的奋斗目标以后，派出专人到著名的陕西西凤酒厂和山西杏花村酒厂学习经验。他们推广了这些工厂的先进经验，已使直沽高粱酒达到了“西凤”酒的水平。
    在学、赶、创名牌运动中，许多工厂建立了产品质量档案制度。这是认真贯彻执行质量规划和保证产品质量不断提高的一项很有成效的措施。“质量档案”包括每个产品的质量标准、赶超对象的质量分析记录、每月产品质量分析检验的文字资料和实物资料、产品质量鉴定书，以及贸易部门和消费者的意见等。有了产品质量档案资料，就便于对产品质量进行考核和分析对比，发现问题后也可以及时解决。天津制革厂建立牛正面革的质量档案以后，每月都对产品进行一次分析研究，跟赶超对象对比，跟上月和前几个月质量资料对比，及时掌握质量变动情况，随时采取新的措施，提高产品质量。由于采取了这些措施，这个工厂在很短时间内就使牛正面革的含铬量、含油量和拉断力、伸长力等质量指标，全部达到或超过了轻工业部规定的标准，成为全国第一流的产品。5月份他们又作到了牛正面革干湿擦不掉色，产品质量又有了进一步提高。
