Inner Mongolia: All Circles Enthusiastically Support Agriculture

	Industrial Sector: Making every effort to manufacture and repair agricultural tools
	Commercial Sector: Increased supply of powered irrigation machinery and waterwheels
	Cultural and Educational Sector: Helping with scientific research and conducting mobile medical services

	(Our newspaper, Hohhot, 3rd dispatch) The people of all ethnic groups on the industrial, commercial, cultural, and educational fronts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are comprehensively launching a new upsurge in supporting agricultural production, such as summer hoeing, land reclamation, multiple planting, and disaster prevention.
	Industrial front workers, under the slogan of "Agriculture needs what, we will manufacture what; needs how much, we will produce how much," are making every effort to manufacture and repair various agricultural tools. In recent months, the Ulanqab League's industrial departments have manufactured more than 266,000 pieces of machinery and farm tools for communes for sowing, irrigation, summer hoeing, and pest control. They have also helped communes repair more than 178,000 pieces of damaged machinery. The industrial departments of each banner and county in this league, following the spirit of "repairing before the farming season arrives," have also dispatched more than 1,000 skilled craftsmen, carrying tools and spare parts, deep into rural communes and production teams to conduct mobile repairs in the countryside. For example, Fengzhen County dispatched more than 60 mobile repair technicians, who, from late March to now, have traveled to 64 management areas and repaired more than 1,100 pieces of machinery, which has been greatly welcomed by the commune members. To regularly and more effectively support agriculture, 55 factories in this league have been linked with 86 rural communes, providing support to agriculture in terms of materials, technology, and manpower. They have also trained a large number of technicians for the communes and conducted mobile repairs in the countryside.
	The new upsurge of the commercial sector in the autonomous region to support agriculture is also developing vigorously. At present, 100,000 commercial workers throughout the region are fighting to support and seize a great agricultural harvest. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, the commercial departments throughout the region had supplied and distributed to rural and pastoral areas power irrigation machinery and waterwheels, such as locomotive boilers, diesel engines, and gas engines, an increase of 60% to 90% over the same period last year. In April and May, they supplied more than 25,000 sets of semi-mechanized farm tools such as weeding hoes, shovel tillers, and land reclamation plows, and more than 4,800 tons of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to agricultural and pastoral areas, an increase of one to four times over the same period last year. In addition, nearly 300,000 pieces of small farm tools such as hoe blades, water buckets, hoe handles, and hoe hooks were supplied, promptly supporting the needs of agricultural and pastoral production. In order to meet production needs in a timely manner, some banner and county commercial workers have also launched a "thousand vehicles, ten thousand burdens" delivery campaign. Commercial workers in the Horqin Left Rear Banner of the Zhaolimu League, under the slogan of "not afraid of wearing out shoulders, not afraid of wearing out shoes, carts pull, people carry, supply goes before production," organized more than 300 people into delivery teams and launched five successive surprise delivery campaigns. Currently, they have delivered more than 100,000 pieces of large and small farm tools, powerfully supporting summer hoeing production.
	The cultural and educational front of the autonomous region has also launched an upsurge in supporting agriculture. In addition to actively carrying out literacy campaigns in agricultural and pastoral areas in conjunction with production, the cultural and educational departments of the Zhaowuda League have also helped each banner, county, and commune establish more than 880 agricultural scientific research institutes (stations), trained more than 4,100 technical research personnel, and also held agricultural training courses, training more than 25,000 agricultural and pastoral technicians. The health departments of this league have dispatched more than 2,000 medical personnel to participate in summer hoeing and conduct mobile medical services. Teachers and students in primary and secondary schools throughout the autonomous region have also been taking time out in recent days to help communes with field management work.

    内蒙古各界热情支援农业
    工业部门：千方百计制造和修配农业工具
    商业部门：动力排灌机械和水车供应增多
    文教部门：帮助搞科学研究开展巡回医疗
    本报呼和浩特3日电　内蒙古自治区工业、商业和文教战线上的各族职工，全面掀起了支援夏锄、开荒、多种和防灾等农业生产的新高潮。
    工业战线职工正在“农业需要什么，就制造什么；需要多少，就生产多少”的口号下，千方百计地制造和修配各种农业工具。乌兰察布盟工业部门最近几个月内已为人民公社制造了播种、排灌、夏锄和杀虫等机器和农具二十六万六千多件，帮助公社修配了各种破损机具十七万八千多件；这个盟各旗县的工业部门，还根据“农时未到，修配先行”的精神，同时还先后派出一千多名能工巧匠，携带工具和配件，深入农村各公社和生产队开展在农村巡回修配，丰镇县派出巡回修配的六十多名技工，从3月下旬到现在，已走遍六十四个管理区，修配好各种机具达一千一百多件，受到社员极大欢迎。为经常地和更有效地支援农业，这个盟已有五十五个工厂同八十六个农村公社挂钩，从物资、技术和人力等方面支援农业外，还为公社培训了大批技术人员，在农村巡回修配。
    自治区商业部门支援农业的新高潮，也正汹涌澎湃地开展着。现在全区十万商业职工，正为支援和夺取农业大丰收而奋战。据不完全统计，到5月底全区商业部门已经供应和下放到农村牧区的锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机等动力排灌机械和水车，比去年同期增长60％到90％，4、5两个月供应农牧区的耘锄、铲趟机、开荒犁等半机械化农具达二万五千多台、化肥和农药四千八百多吨，比去年同期增长了一至四倍。另外，还供应了近三十万件锄板、水斗子、锄杠、锄钩等小农具，及时支援了农牧业生产的需要。为了适时地满足生产需要，有些旗县商业职工还开展了“千车万担”的送货运动。哲里木盟科尔沁左翼后旗商业职工在“不怕磨破肩、不怕鞋跑穿、车拉贯、人挑担，供应走在生产前”的口号下，组织了三百多人的送货队，先后开展了五次突击送货运动，目前已送出大小农具十万多件，有力地支援了夏锄生产。
    自治区文教战线也掀起了支援农业的高潮。昭乌达盟文教部门除结合生产在农牧区积极开展扫盲运动外，还帮助各旗县、公社建立起八百八十多处农业科学研究所（站），培训了四千一百多名技术研究人员，另外还举办农业训练班，培养了二万五千多名农牧业技术员。这个盟的卫生部门派出了两千多名医务人员，参加夏锄和开展巡回医疗。自治区各地的中小学师生，连日来也抽出时间，帮助公社进行田间管理工作。
