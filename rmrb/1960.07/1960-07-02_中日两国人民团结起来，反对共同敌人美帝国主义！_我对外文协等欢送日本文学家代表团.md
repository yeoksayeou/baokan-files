Dear Mr. Noma Hiroshi, dear friends of the Japanese literary delegation:

    A month ago, we in Beijing welcomed with respect our dear comrades-in-arms who came to our country from the front line of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle. In this month, we have lived together, fought together, strengthened the unity between our two peoples, further developed the fraternal fighting friendship between our two peoples, and strengthened the great unity between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in the common cause of fighting against U.S. imperialism.

    In the past year, the struggle of the Japanese people has undergone profound changes. In this not-so-long month, the Japanese people have successively achieved major victories in their struggle, namely: under the powerful impact of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle, the trip to Japan by the U.S. bandit chieftain Eisenhower was rejected by the Japanese people, and its loyal lackey Kishi Nobusuke was also forced to announce his shameful resignation. This is a new and brilliant victory for the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents, and also a brilliant victory for the peace-loving people of the world. The Japanese people's victories one after another have severely hit the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to plot a new war and defended peace in Asia and the world. This is another new and major encouragement and support for the Chinese people and the people of the world. Here, on behalf of the Chinese cultural and artistic circles and the Chinese people, I express my heartfelt and lofty respect to the heroic Japanese people.

    However, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are not reconciled to their shameful defeat. Now they are playing new tricks, trying to abandon Kishi Nobusuke and replace him with a new Kishi Nobusuke by changing the soup but not the medicine, in order to ease the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, continue to maintain their reactionary rule, and strengthen the suppression of democratic forces, so as to maintain the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that betrays the interests of the Japanese nation and preserve U.S. imperialist aggressive forces in Japan. However, the Japanese people are awakened people, and the new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism will never succeed. After forcing Kishi Nobusuke to step down, the Japanese people are making persistent efforts and carrying out the 20th National Unified Action to strengthen the struggle for smashing the illegal U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and burying U.S. imperialism and all its running dogs in Japan. As Mr. Noma Hiroshi said: "This struggle will never stop, it will continue to advance and develop!"

    Japan is in the midst of great changes. As Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese people are very promising." "Japan's independence and freedom are very promising. The abolition of the 'U.S.-Japan Security Treaty' and the abolition of U.S. military bases will guarantee Japan's independence and peace." Therefore, the Japanese people's greater combat actions against U.S. imperialism are still to come. You are coming from the front lines of the battle, and now you are going back to the front lines of the battle. Here, we wish you greater achievements in your new battles and move from victory to new victory. In the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, the Chinese people will always stand by the Japanese people, give firm support, and fight to the end together!

    Finally, I propose:

    For the great fighting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples,
    For the victory in the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty,
    For the health of the Japanese literary delegation!
    To drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia,
    For world peace,
    Cheers!

    Tonight, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Mr. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and friends from the cultural circles of Beijing for holding such a grand farewell banquet for our Japanese literary delegation.

    Our Japanese literary delegation has been in China for more than a month, and in Beijing for nearly a month. Here, we have received the unanimous warm welcome from the Chinese cultural circles and the Chinese people, and the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has received the great support of the Chinese people. In our visit to China, which is full of joy and gratitude, and with the support of the fierce struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan, we have approached, very close to, the purpose of our visit to China. This purpose is to learn about the new culture in the Chinese Great Leap Forward, increase the infinite strength to fight for Japan's independence and democracy, and enhance the friendship and unity between Japan and China that no force can stop.

    At this delightful farewell banquet, we feel that we are not the same as we were a month ago. Our visit to China has been extremely successful. We have now victoriously found the source of strength for fighting for Japan, the source of fighting culture, that we have been seeking, and it has been firmly grasped in our hands.

    Now, we can return to Japan with what is necessary in the struggle for Japan's future and present. We are about to return to the front line against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The reason why we can carry these gifts of great significance back to Japan is entirely due to the hospitality of the two groups that hosted us, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association, and the help from all sides. Here, let me express my greatest respect and gratitude to the two groups that hosted us!

    Through the struggles of June 4, June 15, and June 22, the struggle of the Japanese people has developed rapidly and has reached an unstoppable level. It has shattered Eisenhower's plan to visit Japan and forced Kishi Nobusuke to announce his resignation. This struggle, now holding on to the strong demand to oppose the establishment of a second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, continues to move forward. In the past month, the Japanese movement has made great progress and laid the foundation for building a new Japan. Chairman Mao said that the Japanese people have found a way to free their country from subordination. This is very well said, and we are very happy. The Japanese people have been looking for fifteen years, and today they have finally found it. Everything has to start anew, and a new Japan is being born in the world. I saw this new Japan and New China holding hands, tightly united together. We can all see it very clearly, and this is the thing that makes us the happiest! In China, we have seen the Chinese people's infinite support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. We realize that we are the closest and most trusted friends and comrades fighting for a common goal - to overthrow U.S. imperialism. After returning to Japan, we will definitely widely publicize this point on the Japanese front line, and we believe that our understanding will become deeper and deeper with the Japanese people.

    The Japanese battle is about to enter the twenty-first unified action. The goal of the struggle is to overthrow the precarious and crumbling Kishi cabinet in one fell swoop, and to demand the establishment of a cabinet that opposes the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and has the power to guarantee that Japan will have a democratic, peaceful, and independent cabinet. The current struggle in Japan is also a struggle to completely oppose U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and it requires us to form a broader united front. We are about to return to Japan and throw ourselves into this struggle once again. We firmly believe that behind us, there is the power of the people of the world supporting us. I must clearly tell you here that it is the result of visiting China that has given us this power. I guarantee you here that we will definitely bring this power back to Japan, and we will definitely devote all our efforts to the battle in Japan.

    I once again thank you for your hospitality and help.

    Finally, let us hold on to the friendship that we have built up in China that no force can destroy, and congratulate Mr. Chu Tunan, Mr. Mao Dun, Mr. Liao Chengzhi, and all of you gentlemen on your health.

    Let us raise our glasses to celebrate the victory of the struggle of the Chinese and Japanese peoples united against U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism!

    Congratulations to the Japanese literary and art circles and the Chinese literary and art circles for their close unity in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism!

    中日两国人民团结起来，反对共同敌人美帝国主义！
    我对外文协等欢送日本文学家代表团
    楚图南说：代表团的访问进一步发展了中日两国人民的战斗友谊
    野间宏说：我们深信，全世界人民的力量在支持日本人民的斗争
    新华社1日讯　中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南今晚在中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会为欢送日本文学家代表团举行的宴会上说：“在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争中，中国人民将永远站在日本人民一边，给予坚决支持，共同战斗到底！”
    今晚，茅盾、廖承志、李德全、许广平、周扬、丁西林、张致祥、阳翰笙等人都出席了宴会。他们分别同日本文学家代表团团长野间宏，团员龟井胜一郎、松冈洋子、竹内实、开高健、大江健三郎、白土吾夫等围桌相坐，尽情畅谈。
    楚图南在宴会上讲话说，日本文学家代表团在中国的访问，“加强了我们两国人民之间的团结，进一步发展了我们两国人民的兄弟般的战斗友谊，加强了中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义斗争的共同事业中的大团结。”（讲话全文另发）
    楚图南热烈祝贺日本人民在新的战斗中获得更大的成就，从胜利走向新的胜利。
    野间宏团长讲话。他说：我们访问中国的旅行已经收到了极大的成功，我们所探求的为了日本而战斗的力量的源泉、战斗的文化的源泉，今天我们已经胜利地找到了。（讲话全文另发）
    楚图南和野间宏的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    出席今晚宴会的，还有文化界著名人士邵荃麟、老舍、欧阳予倩、梅兰芳、周培源、萧三等人。在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会一直在友谊的气氛中进行。宴会结束的时候，宾主依依不舍地互相祝愿：“中日两国人民团结起来，反对共同敌人美帝国主义！”
              楚图南讲话全文亲爱的野间宏先生、日本文学家代表团的全体朋友们：
    一个月以前，我们在北京以崇敬的心情欢迎过我们亲爱的战友从日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的前线来到我国访问。在这一个月里，我们生活在一起，战斗在一起，加强了我们两国人民之间的团结，进一步发展了我们两国人民的兄弟般的战斗友谊，加强了中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义斗争的共同事业中的大团结。
    在最近一年以来，日本人民的斗争发生了深刻的变化，在这不算长的一个月里，日本人民接连取得了斗争的重大胜利，这就是：在日本人民的反美反岸斗争浪潮的强大冲击下，美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔“访问”日本之行，吃了日本人民的闭门羹，它的忠实走狗岸信介也被迫宣布了可耻的下台。这是日本人民的反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争的新的辉煌的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的辉煌的胜利。日本人民一个胜利接着一个胜利，严重地打击了美帝国主义策划新战争的阴谋，保卫了亚洲和世界的和平，这对于中国人民和全世界人民又是一个新的重大的鼓舞和支持。在此，我代表中国文化艺术界和中国人民对英勇的日本人民表示衷心的和崇高的敬意。
    但是，美日反动派并不甘心自己的可耻失败，现在他们正在玩弄新的花招，企图以换汤不换药的手法，抛弃岸信介，换上一个新的岸信介，以此来缓和日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，继续维持其反动统治，加强镇压民主力量，以便保持出卖日本民族利益的新日美“安全条约”，保全美帝国主义在日本的侵略势力。然而，日本人民是觉悟了的人民，美帝国主义的新阴谋永远不会得逞的。日本人民在迫使岸信介下台以后，又再接再厉，正在开展第二十次全国统一行动，加强斗争，为粉碎非法的日美“安全条约”、埋葬美帝国主义及其在日本的一切走狗而进行英勇的奋斗。正如野间宏先生所说的：“这个斗争绝不会停止，它将继续前进和发展！”
    日本正处在伟大的变化中。正如毛主席所说：“日本人民是很有希望的”。“日本的独立和自由是很有希望的。取消‘日美安全保障条约’、取消美国军事基地，日本的独立和和平就会有保证”。因此日本人民反对美帝国主义的更大战斗行动还在后边。你们是从战斗的前线而来，现在又要回到战斗的前线去。我们在这里，预祝你们在新的战斗中获得更大的成就，从胜利走向新的胜利。在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争中，中国人民将永远站在日本人民一边，给予坚决支持，共同战斗到底！
    最后，我建议：
    为中日两国人民伟大的战斗友谊，
    为粉碎日美军事同盟条约斗争的胜利，
    为日本文学家代表团的健康！
    为把美帝国主义赶出亚洲，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
    野间宏讲话全文
    今晚承蒙中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南先生，中国作家协会主席茅盾先生以及北京市文化界的朋友们，为我们日本文学家代表团举行这样盛大的欢送宴会，让我表示衷心的感谢。
    我们日本文学家代表团到中国已经一个多月了，到北京来也将近一个月了。在这里，我们受到了中国文化界和中国人民一致的热烈欢迎，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争得到了中国人民的极大的支持。我们在充满着喜悦和感激心情的访华旅行中，在日本开展的反对新日美“安全条约”的激烈斗争的支持下，接近了，十分接近了我们访问中国的目的。这个目的就是学习中国大跃进当中的新文化，增加为争取日本独立、民主而斗争的无限力量，增强任何力量也阻止不了的日本和中国之间的友谊和团结。
    在这令人喜欢的欢送宴会上，我们感到：我们已经不是一个月以前的我们了。我们访问中国的旅行已经收到了极大的成功，我们所探求的为了日本而战斗的力量的源泉、战斗的文化的源泉，今天我们已经胜利地找到了，它已经被牢牢地掌握在我们的手里。
    现在，我们已经可以带着在为日本的未来和现在而战的斗争中所必要的东西回到日本去了。我们就要回到反对日美军事同盟条约的战线中去了。我们所以能够携带着这些具有伟大意义的礼物回到日本，全靠中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会的招待和各方面的帮助。在这里让我对招待我们的两团体致以最大的敬意和谢意！
    通过6月4日、6月15日和6月22日的斗争，日本人民的斗争发展很快，已经达到了势不可当的程度，它粉碎了艾森豪威尔的访日计划，它迫使岸信介不得不宣布下台。这个斗争，现在还抱着反对成立第二个岸信介内阁的强烈的要求，继续前进着。一个月来，日本的运动有了很大的发展，筑成了建设新日本的基础。毛主席说，日本人民已经找到了使自己的国家摆脱从属的方法。这话说得非常好，我们非常高兴。日本人民找了十五年，今天终于把它找到了。一切都要从新作起，一个新的日本正在世界上诞生着。我看到了这个新的日本和新中国手拉着手，紧紧地团结在一起。我们都看得十分清楚，而且这是我们最为高兴的一桩事情！在中国，我们看到了中国人民对日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的无限支持。我们认识到我们大家是在为一个共同目的——打倒美帝国主义而斗争着的最亲密的最可信赖的朋友和同志。回到日本以后，我们一定在日本的战线中广泛地宣传这一点，我们相信我们的认识会和日本人民一起越来越深刻起来。
    日本的战斗就要进入第二十一次统一行动了。斗争的目标是一举推倒风雨飘摇，崩溃在即的岸内阁，要求成立反对日美军事同盟条约，有力量保障日本出现一个民主、和平独立的内阁。日本当前的斗争也就是彻底反对美帝国主义和日本帝国主义的斗争，要求我们结成更加广泛的统一战线。我们就要回到日本，再一次投入到这一斗争中去了。我们深信在我们背后，有全世界人民的力量在支持着我们。我必须在这里明确地告诉诸位，是访问中国的结果，才使我们得到了这种力量。我在这里向大家保证：我们一定把这一力量带回日本去，我们一定全力投入日本的战斗。
    我再一次感谢诸位对我们的招待和帮助。
    最后，让我们抱着我们在中国建立起来的任何力量也破坏不了的友谊，祝贺楚图南先生、茅盾先生、廖承志先生，以及诸位先生的健康。
    让我们举杯祝贺中日两国人民团结一致反对美帝国主义、反对日本帝国主义的斗争获得胜利！
    祝贺日本文学艺术界和中国文学艺术界紧密团结，反对美帝国主义、反对日本军国主义的斗争获得胜利！
