    Building a Fortune by Growing Pumpkins
    In our commune, there is a small mountain village with fewer than fifty households called Daozuo Gu. This place has high mountains and poor land. In the past, it was a well-known poor team in the commune. Since this production team started growing pumpkins on a large scale on the mountain land, this poor team has seen "four mores" (more pig farming, more manure accumulation, more grain production, more income) and "one saving" (saving on food grain). Everyone says they built their fortune by growing pumpkins.
    This year, the whole team planted more than 15,000 pumpkin plants. They have also summarized a set of experiences in managing pumpkins, which can be summarized as: grasping the four key links of planting, managing, preventing, and harvesting. Because they plant well and manage well, the pumpkins of the whole team are now growing particularly vigorously, with strings of young pumpkins on each vine.

    种南瓜起家
    我们公社有一个不到五十户的小山村叫道坐崮，这地方山高地薄，过去，是公社里有名的穷队。自从这个生产队利用山地大种南瓜以后，这个穷队却出现了“四多”（养猪多、积肥多、打粮多、收入多）、“一省”（省吃粮），大家都说他们是种南瓜起家的。
    今年，全队又种了南瓜一万五千多棵。他们还总结了一套管理南瓜的经验，概括起来就是：抓住种、管、防、收四个环节。由于种得好，管得好，现在全队的南瓜长得格外茁壮，每条瓜蔓上都有成串的幼瓜。
