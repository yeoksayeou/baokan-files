    Vigorously Launch a Mountainous Area Tool Reform Movement
    In the past year or two, China's mountainous area tool reform movement has seen significant development. An increasing number of improved tools and semi-mechanized tools are being used in mountainous agricultural production and other production areas. Some new agricultural machines suitable for mountainous operations have also begun to appear. Recently, a mass movement to establish small hydropower stations and water turbine stations has emerged in some mountainous areas. The development of the mountainous area tool reform movement is a major event in the technical transformation of agriculture in vast mountainous regions.
    China is a country with many mountains, and mountainous and semi-mountainous areas account for about 80% of the total land area. Of the country's cultivated land, 42% is mountainous and hilly land. In some provinces and autonomous regions, mountainous and hilly areas account for more than 60% or 70% of the total cultivated land area. Therefore, the mountainous area economy accounts for a large proportion of China's overall national economy. In addition to producing large quantities of grain, mountainous areas are also rich in timber, silkworm cocoons, tea, fruits, dried fruits, tea oil, honey, mushrooms, edible tree fungus, medicinal materials, tung oil, raw lacquer, valuable fur, and many other products. In recent years, thousands of species of wild plants that can be used as industrial raw materials for fiber, starch, oil, tannin, spices, etc., have been discovered in various places, most of which are produced in mountainous areas. Mountainous areas have extremely rich mineral deposits and are the main raw material base for heavy industry. Many mountainous areas are also revolutionary base areas, and the vast people there have made great contributions to the revolutionary cause. All of this shows how significant it is to accelerate the development of the mountainous area economy for accelerating China's socialist construction and improving people's lives.
    Our Party and state have always attached importance to the development of mountainous area production and construction. Since the founding of the country, we have adopted various effective measures to help the people in mountainous areas restore and develop production. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the state, the mountainous area economy has made great progress. However, in order to fundamentally change the original backward appearance of mountainous areas and build all the mountainous areas in the country into prosperous and beautiful new socialist villages, greater efforts are still needed, and the technical transformation of agriculture in mountainous areas must be realized.
    Most mountainous areas in China are sparsely populated, with a relative lack of labor and animal power, backward production tools, and very inconvenient transportation. In recent years, especially since 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people in mountainous areas have made great efforts to change the technical face of agriculture in mountainous areas and have achieved good results. However, generally speaking, tool reform work in mountainous areas is weaker than in plain areas and urgently needs to be greatly strengthened.
    Mountainous terrain is complex, with hills and highlands, as well as valleys and basins, slopes, and terraced fields. The land plots are small, the slopes are steep, and the roads are rugged and narrow. There are indeed certain difficulties in innovating tools and realizing agricultural mechanization, but there are also advantages: mountainous areas are generally located upstream of rivers, high above the ground, which is convenient for using hydropower to universally build small hydropower stations and water turbine stations, thereby easily obtaining a large amount of cheap power. Mountainous areas have the most timber and bamboo, and new tools can be manufactured using local materials. Therefore, as long as we adhere to the correct set of principles for agricultural technical transformation stipulated by the Party, implement a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, a combination of large, medium, and small sizes, a combination of semi-mechanization and mechanization, adhere to the mass line, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, farmers, rural staff, and scientific and technical personnel, mountainous areas can also be mechanized. A large number of advanced tools that have emerged in the mountainous area tool reform movement in the past two years include improved tools and semi-mechanized tools, as well as new-style machinery. The Mountain Agricultural Tool Selection Meeting jointly held by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Industry in Wushan County, Gansu Province, in March this year, selected a complete set of 21 excellent mountain farming tools from 104 mountain agricultural tools sent from various places. Among the twelve types of agricultural tools that have been finalized for promotion, there are advanced agricultural tools in various aspects such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, cultivating, and plant protection, as well as advanced electromechanical rope traction machines suitable for use on mountain slopes and terraced fields. It can be predicted that with the further development of the tool reform movement and agricultural machinery scientific research work, and with the increasing support of the industrial sector, more mechanized agricultural tools for mountainous areas will be created, and the mechanization of mountainous areas will be further realized.
    The special natural conditions and complex terrain of mountainous areas are a problem that must be given special attention in the process of tool reform. In order to adapt to the situation of small land plots, slopes, and more terraced fields, in the tool reform in mountainous areas, it is necessary to especially create and promote small and light tools and machinery that adapt to the characteristics of various mountainous operations. However, does this mean that all tools in mountainous areas must be started from scratch and created from scratch? No. All things have both particularity and commonality. Mountainous areas and plains have different conditions, and the tools needed are not entirely the same, but this does not exclude the mutual learning and appropriate exchange of production tools between these two regions. For example, among the mountain agricultural tools that have been finalized, there are several (such as the rake and the automatic seed drill) that were introduced from the plain areas; some tools (such as the mountain electric rope traction machine) were first created and finalized in the plain areas, and then appropriately improved and upgraded based on the characteristics of the mountainous areas before being introduced into the mountainous areas; tractors are suitable for plain areas, but not all tractors are absolutely unable to go up the mountains. According to the results of experiments in some areas, tractors with 10 to 15 horsepower can also cultivate land on slopes of 12 degrees or less. Even between mountainous areas and plains, some tools that are roughly commonly used can be found. As for various types of mountainous areas, of course, many commonly applicable tools can be found. For example, the No. 16 mountain plow, which is widely used in the northwest region, has been widely promoted in the mountainous areas of the southwest region; the water and drought bidirectional plow in Fujiang County, Sichuan Province, has also been proven to be very good to use in the mountainous areas of Wushan County, Gansu Province, after testing. From this, a conclusion should be drawn: in the mountainous area tool reform movement, it is necessary to avoid mechanically applying foreign experience without specifically analyzing the specific conditions of the local area, and also avoid unilaterally emphasizing regional particularities and excluding any foreign experience.
    Tool reform in mountainous areas has already had a certain foundation. The current problem is to promote this movement with greater strength. According to the needs of production development, various types of operation tools should be reformed in a planned manner. Of course, reform should focus on key points. Farmland capital construction (water conservancy, soil and water conservation, land leveling, etc.) is the basic guarantee for agricultural production in mountainous areas and is also one of the most labor-intensive operations in mountainous areas. In the tool reform movement, this key point needs to be grasped first, so that high-efficiency tools are widely used in various aspects such as ditch blocking, bulldozing, dam construction, loading and unloading, and compaction, to accelerate the speed of farmland capital construction. A major reform of transportation tools is also a key point. In many mountainous areas, transportation is almost entirely reliant on human carrying and donkey carrying, just as the farmers say: "Clothes are worn out, and donkey backs are crushed!" According to the survey data of the Dongliang Production Team of Luomen Commune in Wushan County, Gansu Province, fertilizer transportation alone accounts for half of the labor force used in the team's annual agricultural production. To change this backward situation in transportation in mountainous areas, it is necessary to vigorously promote advanced transportation tools while repairing roads, and use animal-drawn carts, ships, rail cars, cableways, and other tools to replace human carrying and donkey carrying. In addition, agricultural production tools and tools for agricultural and sideline product processing, forestry, and animal husbandry should also be accelerated and reformed according to the characteristics of mountainous areas. Finally, all places should fully utilize the favorable conditions of mountainous areas, vigorously develop hydropower stations and small hydropower stations, and fully utilize these natural power energy sources. First, mechanization or semi-mechanization of drainage and irrigation, agricultural and sideline product processing, and feed processing can be realized. The facts in many areas have proven that as long as the key points are grasped and actively carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, tool reform in mountainous areas can progress rapidly. Guigang Commune, Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, was a technologically backward mountainous commune a year ago. Due to the comprehensive and in-depth technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the technical appearance of this commune has been greatly changed in less than a year. In the past year, more than 200 kilometers of mountain roads and 70 kilometers of roads accessible to cars and tractors have been built, realizing transportation vehicle and ship-based and hoisted, and transportation efficiency has increased five to six times. The entire commune manufactured and promoted more than 23,000 agricultural tools of various types for spring plowing, rice transplanting, summer harvesting, and summer planting this year. Eleven hydropower stations, 54 water turbine stations, and 58 hydraulic processing plants were built. Due to the comprehensive implementation of tool reform, the labor force used for fertilizer accumulation this year was reduced from 10,000 last year to 4,000, the fertilizer accumulation time was shortened by one month, but the amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu increased sharply from 800 dan last year to 3,000 to 4,000 dan. The labor force used for food processing was reduced from the original 500 people to 50 people, and the number of cooks was reduced from more than 3,200 to more than 1,400. Due to the significant improvement in labor efficiency, this commune reclaimed 200,000 mu of wasteland this spring, newly opened 2,000 mu of paddy fields, and directly promoted the development of diversified economy. Now Guangdong Province is widely carrying out the movement to learn from Guigang Commune. Many advanced communes of mountainous area technical transformation like Guigang Commune have emerged in other places, and their experiences should be well summarized and universally promoted.
    Strengthening the Party's leadership is the guarantee for the successful development of tool reform in mountainous areas. Wherever there are mountainous areas, it is necessary to carefully study the specific problems of tool reform and technical transformation in mountainous areas, and formulate specific contents, methods, and steps for tool reform in mountainous areas according to local conditions. Agricultural machinery research departments and agricultural machinery production departments should go to the mountainous areas to "plant experimental fields" under the unified leadership of the Party. We believe that with the efforts of the people in mountainous areas and with the support of the whole Party and the whole people, China's technical innovation and technical revolution movement in mountainous areas will surely develop rapidly and comprehensively like the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in all regions of the country.

    大力开展山区工具改革运动
    近一两年来，我国山区的工具改革运动有了很大的发展。山区农业生产方面和其他生产方面使用的各种改良工具和半机械化工具越来越多，一些适用于山区作业的新型农业机械也开始出现了；近来，在一部分山区又兴起了大办小型水电站和水力站的群众运动。山区工具改革运动的发展，是广大山区农业技术改造的一件大事。
    我国是一个多山的国家，山区和半山区的面积约占国土总面积的80％左右。全国耕地中，有42％是山地和丘陵地。有些省和自治区的山地和丘陵地面积占耕地总面积的百分之六、七十以上。因而山区经济在我国整个国民经济中占着很大的比重。山区除了出产大量的粮食以外，还盛产木材、蚕茧、茶叶、水果、干果、茶油、蜂蜜、蘑菇、木耳、药材、桐油、生漆、珍贵毛皮以及许多其他产品。近年来，各地发现了几千种可做纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶、香料等工业原料的野生植物，其中大部分产在山区。山区有着极为丰富的矿藏，是重工业的主要原料基地。许多山区又是革命根据地，那里的广大人民对于革命事业曾经作过极大的贡献。所有这些都说明，加速发展山区经济，对于加速我国社会主义建设，对于改善人民生活，具有多么巨大的意义。
    我们的党和国家是一贯重视发展山区生产建设的，从建国开始，就采取各种有效措施，帮助山区人民恢复和发展生产。在党的领导和国家的支援下，山区经济有了巨大的发展，但是，为了从根本上改变山区原来的落后面貌，把全国所有的山区都建设成为繁荣、美丽的社会主义新农村，还需要作更大的努力，必须实现山区农业技术改造。
    我国的多数山区地广人稀，劳动力和畜力都比较缺乏，生产工具落后，交通很不便利。近几年来，特别是1958年以来，山区人民在党的领导下，在改变山区农业技术面貌方面作了很大的努力，取得了良好的成绩。但是，一般地说，山区的工具改革工作比起平原地区要薄弱一些，迫切需要大大加强。
    山区地形复杂，既有丘陵高地，也有沟谷、盆地，既有坡地，也有梯田，而且地块小，坡度大，道路崎岖狭窄，在革新工具和实现农业机械化方面确实有一定的困难，但也有它的有利的一面：山区一般位于河流上游，居高临下，便于利用水力动力普遍建设小型水电站和水力站，从而易于获得大量廉价的动力。山区木材、竹材最多，制造新工具，可以就地取材。因此，只要坚持贯彻党所规定的农业技术改造的一套正确方针，实行土洋并举，大中小相结合，半机械化和机械化结合，坚持群众路线，充分发挥工人、农民、农村工作人员和科学技术工作人员的积极性和创造性，山区同样可以机械化。近两年来山区工具改革运动中出现的大量先进工具，既有改良工具和半机械化工具，也有新式机械。今年3月农业部和农业机械工业部在甘肃省武山县联合召开的山地农具评选会议，曾经从各地送去的一百零四件山地农具中评选出成套的优良的山地耕作工具二十一件。在定型推广的十二种农具中，有犁、耙、播种、中耕、植物保护等多方面的先进农具，还有适应山区坡地、梯田上使用的先进的机电绳索牵引机。可以预料，随着工具改革运动和农业机械科学研究工作的进一步发展，随着工业部门的支援的日益加强，一定会有更多的山区机械化农具被创造出来，并进一步实现山区的机械化。
    山区自然条件特殊，地形复杂，这是在工具改革过程当中必须特别充分注意的一个问题。为了适应地块小、坡地和梯田多的情况，山区工具改革中，必须特别创造和推广适应各种山区作业特点的小巧轻便的工具和机械。但是，这是不是说，山区的一切工具都必须另起炉灶，从头创起呢？不是的。各种事物既有特殊性，也有共同性。山区和平原，条件不同，需要的工具不尽相同，但是这并不是排斥这两种地区在生产工具方面互相取长补短和适当的交流。例如，已经定型的山地农具中，有几种（如耢和自动下籽耧等）就是从平原地区引进的；有的工具（如山区电力绳索牵引机）也是首先由平原地区创造并定型，后来又根据山区的特点适当加以改进提高引进山区的；拖拉机适于平原地区，但是并非任何拖拉机都绝对不能上山。根据某些地区试验的结果，十到十五马力的拖拉机在十二度以下的坡地上也可以耕地。山区和平原之间尚且可以找到某些大体共同使用的工具，至于各种类型的山区之间，当然更可以找到许多共同适用的工具。比如广泛使用于西北地区的十六号山地犁，在西南地区的山区已经大量推广；四川省涪江县的水旱双向犁，在甘肃省的武山县山区经过试验证明也很好使用。由此应该得出一个结论：在山区工具改革运动中，既要避免不具体分析当地具体条件，生搬硬套，也不能片面强调地区特殊，排斥任何外地经验。
    山区的工具改革已经有了一定的基础，现在的问题是用更大的力量来推进这个运动，应当根据生产发展的需要，对于各方面的作业工具有计划地进行改革。当然，改革要抓住重点。农田基本建设（水利、水土保持、平整土地等等）是山区农业生产的基本保障，也是山区最费劳动力的作业之一，在工具改革运动中，首先需要抓住这个重点，使堵沟、推土、打坝、装卸、夯实等方面都大量使用高工效的工具，加快农田基本建设的速度。大改运输工具也是一个重点。许多山区运输几乎全靠人挑、驴驮，正像农民所说的：“磨破人衣裳，压破驴脊梁！”根据甘肃省武山县洛门公社东梁生产队的调查材料，这个生产队全年农业生产所使用的劳动力中，仅仅肥料运输一项就占去一半。要改变山区运输方面的这种落后状况，必须在整修道路的同时，大量推广进步的运输工具，用畜力车、船舶、轨道车、索道等工具来代替人挑驴驮。此外，对于农业生产工具和农副产品加工、林业和畜牧业等方面的工具，也要根据山区的特点，加速进行改革。最后，一切地方都应该充分利用山区的有利条件，大办水力站、小型水电站，充分利用这些自然动力能源，首先可以使排灌、农副产品加工、饲料加工实现机械化或半机械化。许多地区的事实证明，只要抓住了重点，并且有计划有步骤地积极进行，山区的工具改革是可以进展得很快的。广东省两阳县圭岗公社，一年以前还是一个技术落后的山区公社，由于全面、深入地技术革新和技术革命运动，这个公社在不到一年的时间内，它的技术面貌已经大大改观，一年来修通了二百多公里的山间大道和七十公里可通汽车、拖拉机的公路，实现了运输车船化、吊索化，运输效率提高五倍到六倍。全公社在今年春耕插秧和夏收夏种中制造和推广各种耕作农具二万三千多部。建起了十一座水电站、五十四座水力站和五十八座水力加工厂。由于全面实行了工具改革，今年积肥方面使用的劳动力由去年的一万个减少到四千个，积肥时间缩短一个月，每亩积肥量却由去年的八百担猛增到三千到四千担。口粮加工方面使用的劳动力由原来的五百人减少到五十人，炊事人员由三千二百多人减少到一千四百多人。由于劳动效率显著提高，这个公社今年春季开垦了二十万亩荒山，新开了二千亩稻田，还直接促进了多种经济的发展。现在广东省各地广泛开展了学习圭岗公社的运动。类似圭岗公社这样的山区技术改造的先进公社，别的地方也出现了不少，应当好好总结它们的经验，普遍加以推广。
    加强党的领导，是胜利开展山区工具改革的保证。凡是有山区的地方，都应当认真研究山区工具改革和技术改造的具体问题，因地制宜地规定山区工具改革的具体内容、方法和步骤。农业机械研究部门、农业机具生产部门，应当在党的统一领导下，到山区去“种试验田”。我们相信，在山区人民的努力下，在全党全民的支援下，我国山区的技术革新和技术革命运动，一定会像全国一切地区的技术革新和技术革命运动一样，迅速地全面地发展起来。
