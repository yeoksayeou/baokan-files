At the Third Expanded Council of the Chinese Writers Association, Shao Quanlin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, made a report entitled "Continue to Leap Forward in Battle," and Vice Chairman Lao She made a "Report on Literary Work of Ethnic Minorities." In his report, Shao Quanlin discussed the recent changes and developments in Chinese literature and criticized various fallacies of modern revisionism. When summarizing the achievements of literary creation, he said that in recent years, Chinese literary creation has shown a splendid scene of a hundred flowers blooming, and at the same time, a magnificent new folk song movement and mass creation movement have emerged. In a large number of excellent works, a clear tendency is universally expressed, full of revolutionary heroism and optimism, and the creation styles are unique and compete with each other. On the front of literary theory and criticism, the banner of Marxism-Leninism has been more clearly erected. Shao Quanlin pointed out that eliminating the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and raising the communist consciousness of the people are two inseparable basic tasks of literary creation. In order to complete this major task in socialist construction, it is necessary to better implement the policy of a hundred flowers blooming under the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in creation, to better exert the originality of literature while adhering to the party spirit principle of literature; to strengthen literary theory and criticism, and better practice the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending; to expand the literary team and improve the ideological and artistic level of the team; to improve the quality of literary publications and books, and strengthen editorial work. Finally, he emphasized that the basic key to doing these tasks well is to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, writers will continue to make greater contributions.

In his report, Lao She explained the overall leap forward and the scene of a hundred flowers blooming in ethnic minority literature with rich materials, and elaborated on the rise of new literature and the growth of the literary team of various ethnic minorities, collecting and sorting out classical and folk literary works, learning from each other, literary exchanges, and training cadres. He pointed out that ethnic minority writers and literary workers should, under the leadership of the Party, be high-spirited and go all out to complete the glorious task of building and developing socialist literature.

Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, made a report on the struggle on the drama front and the new tasks of drama work in the past eleven years since the founding of the country at the Second Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Dramatists Association. In his report, Tian Han summarized the grand occasion of the development and prosperity of China's drama cause under the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in the past eleven years. He attributed the achievements and main experiences of the drama work in the past eleven years to the following points: First, through working-class orientation and labor orientation, the team of drama workers has been transformed and strengthened; second, by implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, on the basis of critically inheriting excellent traditions, artistic innovation and creation have been carried out, so that all kinds of dramas have been developed. At the same time, many excellent dramas with considerable ideological and artistic value have been sorted out, adapted, and created, and the methods of expression have also been greatly improved; third, the development of militant drama theory and criticism has played an important role in the innovation and creation of drama art. In his report, Tian Han also focused on how to shape new heroic figures, how to correctly treat and handle the conflicts and contradictions in dramas, and how to inherit and innovate the Chinese and foreign drama traditions. Finally, he put forward the future tasks of drama work, calling on drama workers across the country to face the great goals of national construction, must grit their teeth and work hard, strive for the top, and make greater contributions to the working-class drama cause.

At the Second Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Musicians Association, Lü Ji, Chairman of the Association, made a report entitled "Music Art Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers." He first pointed out that in the past eleven years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, China's music art has made tremendous and exciting achievements; the development of music creation, performance, theoretical criticism, and various music undertakings has been unprecedented in speed and scale. Under the new historical conditions, China's music art has become an active force in consolidating and developing the new economic foundation—the socialist economic foundation. The relationship between musicians and the people has become closer, and professional music work and amateur music work have become two important and mutually promoting components of China's music culture, and the style of music art has been completely renewed. This is the result of implementing the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. When talking about the part of "resolutely taking the socialist road" in his report, Lü Ji emphasized the importance of music workers adhering to going deep into the struggle life of the masses, striving to transform their thinking, establishing a proletarian world view, and thoroughly combining with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. He believes that only in this way can the face of music art be truly changed and socialist music worthy of our great era and great people be created. Lü Ji then talked about the need to thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of modern revisionism in music art. In the final part of his report, he also put forward the glorious tasks for the future, calling on music workers to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, create new music of the Chinese proletariat, and climb to a higher peak than ever before.

At the Second Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Artists Association, the representatives listened to a report by Cai Ruohong, Vice Chairman of the Association, entitled "Strive to Create the Newest and Most Beautiful Art." When talking about the achievements of art creation since the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in his report, Cai Ruohong listed the development of various aspects such as traditional Chinese painting, printmaking, comics, arts and crafts, New Year pictures, oil painting, and sculpture, illustrating that China's art team has greatly expanded, the ideological and artistic level of art creation has been significantly improved, and the themes and contents have become more abundant and diverse, especially in showing the new spiritual outlook of the working people, superior achievements have been made; the forms and styles have also been creatively developed, and the Chinese style and national characteristics have become increasingly distinct. Various art works have played a huge role in encouraging people's production and struggle and beautifying people's lives. He said that on the other hand, the close integration of art and the masses is the upsurge of amateur art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The working masses are not only appreciators of art but also creators of art. The art cause has become a common cause of the vast number of people in our country. Cai Ruohong pointed out that the achievement of these great achievements is the victory of the Party's political direction of serving art for workers, peasants, and soldiers and the literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Cai Ruohong refuted various revisionist fallacies in art creation. He pointed out that only artists with a working-class world view who understand the laws of social development can truly describe all phenomena with their brushes and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and the socialist cause. Cai Ruohong finally put forward the future tasks in his report, requiring art workers to continue to follow the Party's literary and artistic path, continuously improve themselves, and create the newest and most beautiful art for the working people.

At the Second Member Representative Congress of the China Film Workers Association, Xia Yan made a report entitled "Let the Three Red Banners Flutter in the Wind on the Screen." In his report, Xia Yan described the profound changes that China's film industry has experienced in the past decade and the great achievements it has made in ideological and artistic aspects. Xia Yan said that under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, after repeated struggles, Chinese films have embarked on a correct and healthy path. This is a path against imperialism and bourgeois ideology, a path where films serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and the socialist cause, where film workers combine with the working people, and a path where unity in political direction and diversity in artistic style are combined, letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. He said that because we have taken such a path, and because our team is loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause, it has naturally formed the theme thought, creation method, and its unique style with strong combativeness and mass character of Chinese film art. Xia Yan pointed out that in order to more rapidly develop our film industry and improve our film art level, we must be ambitious, aim high, and do our best to complete several of the most important tasks. These tasks are: holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in film work, carrying out a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought; under the major premise of politics in command and art obeying politics, we must study hard, study techniques, and vigorously improve the artistic and technical level of Chinese films; we must adopt a variety of methods to train new forces quickly, well, and economically, and rapidly strengthen our film team.

At the Expanded Council of the Chinese Ballad Singers Association, Tao Dun, Vice Chairman of the Association, made a report on ballad singing work. In his report, Tao Dun described the great achievements and experiences of China's ballad singing work in cultivating a new generation of ballad singing workers, sorting out heritage, creating new works, and innovating music performance art. Tao Dun called on all ballad singing workers to play the role of sharp soldiers and light weapons, strive to implement the direction of literary and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and work hard in the great era. He pointed out that the tasks of ballad singing work in the future are: to step up ideological transformation, expand the training of new ballad singing teams; to develop and improve ballad singing creation, and vigorously carry out mass ballad singing creation movements; to boldly innovate ballad singing music and performance art; to continue to explore, sort out, and organize traditional ballad singing works, and carry out ballad singing work facing rural people's communes and ethnic minority areas.

It will open up more brilliantly in the garden of a hundred flowers together with other arts.

At the Second Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association, Zhou Weizhi made a report entitled "Strive for Greater Prosperity of Dance Art under the Banner of Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought." The report summarized the great achievements made by dance work under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. China's dance art has developed rapidly since the founding of the country. National and folk dances have been excavated and sorted out, emitting new brilliance and gaining the love of the majority of audiences. A professional dance team of the proletariat that is both red and expert is growing, and ballet art has become an art form loved by the masses. China's ballet creation has inherited the excellent heritage of China's national dance and opera, learned from the experience of foreign ballets, and has made certain achievements in exploring the road to creating a new type of national ballet, and many excellent dramas reflecting revolutionary struggles and socialist construction have emerged. When elaborating on whether dance creation should and can express revolutionary history and realistic struggle life, how dance art should implement the literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and the nationalization and mass character of dance art, Zhou Weizhi criticized and refuted various bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts in the field of dance art.

Lin Shan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Folk Literature Research Association, made a report entitled "Push Folk Literature Work to a New Peak" at the Expanded Council of the Chinese Folk Literature Research Association. He said that under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, China's folk literature has opened up a new socialist road. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has advanced by leaps and bounds, and unprecedented socialist new folk songs have emerged, launching a vigorous wind-collecting movement and mass collection, sorting out, compiling, selecting, and research work. The broad masses of working people have risen up to master literature and art themselves. He said that China's folk literature is extremely rich, and mass creation is booming. China's folk literature workers must muster greater enthusiasm, vigorously carry out collection, sorting out, compiling, selection, and research work, and use folk literary works with communist ideas, full of revolutionary spirit, and all healthy and beautiful works to educate the people and to influence and promote the further nationalization and mass character of China's literature and art.

Shi Shaohua, Chairman of the China Photographic Society, made a report at the Second Member Representative Congress of the Photographic Society. He said that under the leadership of the Party, China's photography workers went deep into life and the masses, and in the fiery struggle, vividly, lively, truthfully, and quickly reflected the great achievements of China's socialist revolution and construction, widely introduced advanced figures and advanced experiences, encouraged and inspired the people's revolutionary enthusiasm, promoted production, and enriched the people's cultural life. Therefore, photographic art is loved by the vast number of people in our country. Shi Shaohua said that it is precisely because China's photographic art is closely combined with the central work and directly serves the political struggle led by the Party, it has a strong and clear combativeness. He said that in terms of form, China's photographic art has bright colors and beautiful composition, which is loved by the people of our country, and has achieved a harmonious and lively unity of form and content. In his report, Shi Shaohua called on photography workers across the country to unswervingly continue to move forward along the direction of literary and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause, with both the ambition to climb the peak of photographic art and a down-to-earth work style, strive to improve the ideological and artistic level of their works, and make China's photographic art cause have a greater leap forward.
