    A Great Victory in Transforming Nature
    Wang Zaitian, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    The grand undertaking of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to control deserts and conquer nature has entered a new stage of comprehensive transformation with the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. This great communist feat is of profound significance for rapidly changing the natural landscape of the autonomous region, promoting the high-speed development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and accelerating socialist construction. As Chairman Mao taught us, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done."
    Inner Mongolia is vast and rich in resources. It has fertile farmland, boundless and beautiful grasslands, the Greater Khingan Range forest area like an ocean, and extremely rich underground mineral resources. However, before liberation, due to the long-term political rule of domestic reactionaries and imperialism, the cruel economic plunder, and the weathering erosion of nature, the forests suffered severe damage, resulting in serious soil erosion, which further formed and expanded the deserts. The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have waged countless heroic struggles against the reactionary rulers' crimes of destroying farmland, pastures, and mountains; at the same time, because they suffered greatly from the severe harm of the deserts, they spontaneously carried out some sporadic struggles to conquer nature. However, under the historical conditions at that time, it was not easy to win these struggles. People of all ethnic groups living on the wind and sand line could only endure the miserable life of "the desert ruthlessly pressing on the fertile land, nine out of ten families running out of smoke (food)." By the time of liberation, the area of ​​the desert in Inner Mongolia had expanded to about 16% of the total area of ​​the region. In these desert areas, the climate is dry, the rainfall is scarce, and the shifting sands are rampant with the wind all year round, submerging many farmlands, pastures, roads, and bridges. Even some villages and canals have been taken away by the shifting sands, seriously affecting the rapid development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry in the autonomous region and the smooth progress of national socialist construction.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have actively carried out the work of controlling the deserts. During the economic recovery period, great efforts were made to enclose the sand for grass and forest cultivation, prohibit indiscriminate reclamation and felling, and protect the vegetation in the sandy areas. Then, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, on the basis of agricultural cooperation, in combination with various production and construction projects, planned management of deserts directly endangering farmland and pasture began. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, after the first six-province (region) desert control conference in the country, especially on the basis of the people's commune system, the magnificent project of comprehensive desert control and transformation of nature has entered a new stage. Under the guidance of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's policy of "Party committee leadership, putting politics in command, mobilizing the whole party and the whole people, overall planning, adapting to local conditions, and comprehensive management," with the Ulan Buh, Kubuqi, Maowusu, and Tengger deserts as the focus, measures such as planting trees, planting grass, enclosing sand for grass and forest cultivation, and diverting water to irrigate the sand were adopted for a comprehensive advance. Now, more than 40,000 square kilometers, accounting for about 17% of the desert, have been initially managed, and the vegetation coverage rate of semi-fixed deserts has reached 30%-50%, and the harm of wind and sand has been significantly reduced; the vegetation coverage rate of fixed deserts generally reaches more than 60%. Now, not only are there a wide variety of herbaceous plants and shrubs, but also some artificial arbor and natural arbor have grown. The shelterbelt in eastern Inner Mongolia, which began construction in 1953, includes 13 banners, counties, and cities in three leagues, with an afforestation area of ​​more than 10 million mu, plus a large area of ​​enclosing sand for grass and forest cultivation, which has initially controlled the harm of shifting sand to farmland and pasture. The Bayannur League has built a green belt of forest and grass combination, 350 meters wide and 190 kilometers long, on the edge of the Ulan Buh Desert. It is like a green Great Wall, effectively controlling the eastward invasion of shifting sand, protecting pastures and farmland, and reclaiming more than 400,000 mu of farmland and one million mu of pasture from the desert. These facts prove that violent wind and sand can not only be contained and conquered, but also abundant agricultural products will be reaped in some of the managed deserts. The local people sing joyfully, "Facing the Yellow River in the east and relying on the sand in the west, planting trees and cultivating grass is a good way. After ten years of hard work, the 'Yellow Dragon' (wind and sand) is subdued, and there are people's homes in the green trees."
    This year's desert control work, on the basis of universally strengthening the protection of existing vegetation, has particularly strengthened the construction of sand prevention forest belts, and at the same time combined with large-scale afforestation and grass planting. The afforestation and grass planting area to be completed this year can reach 3 to 4 million mu, and hundreds of kilometers of sand prevention forest belts will be built. This will quickly divide and surround the desert, and will be conducive to fixing and eradicating the desert, thereby more quickly and effectively controlling sand damage, ensuring increased agricultural and animal husbandry production and harvests, and ensuring the safety of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and the Yellow River downstream water conservancy projects.
    In the mass movement to transform the desert, our desert control team has grown rapidly. Now, from the autonomous region to the people's communes in the desert areas, desert control organizations have been established. More than 60 state-owned forest farms, desert control stations, and scientific research units have been established in key desert control areas. There are more than 3,000 professional cadres and workers engaged in desert control, and the desert control professional teams of the people's communes in the desert areas have also developed greatly. At present, there are more than 900 forest farms run by communes and teams, with more than 8,800 fixed afforestation and desert control personnel. In the past few years, nearly 1,000 cadres and scientific and technical personnel have been sent by the central government and relevant departments of Inner Mongolia to conduct a comprehensive survey of the desert. Undoubtedly, these have laid a victorious foundation for further large-scale desert control and conquest of nature in the future.
    The fact that the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have been able to achieve unprecedented great achievements in desert control in just a few years is a victory for the great ethnic policy of the Party and Chairman Mao, and a victory for the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.
    Controlling the desert and conquering nature is a great revolutionary cause, and it is impossible to do without the strong leadership of the Party. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to advance towards the desert in 1958, it was warmly responded to by the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. The Party committees and governments at all levels in Inner Mongolia have conscientiously implemented the general policy formulated at the first six-province (region) desert control conference in the country, and insisted on carrying out the struggle between the two roads and two methods of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Through the whole-people rectification and socialist education movement, they vigorously publicized the importance and possibility of desert control to the vast number of cadres and the masses of people, criticized all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas such as "desert control has no labor force" and "control also cannot be controlled," and strengthened the communist ambition to conquer nature with human determination, laying the ideological foundation for the victorious conquest of the desert.
    To achieve victory in desert control, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. In the desert control movement, on the one hand, we have widely mobilized all forces to provide support in materials and technology from all walks of life. On the other hand, we have given full play to the superiority of the people's commune system, closely combined it with agricultural and animal husbandry production, rationally arranged the labor force, and implemented the integration of long-term preparation by professional organizations and short-term mass assault, the combination of mass-based and state-owned desert control, and the combination of indigenous methods and foreign methods. A whole set of "walking on two legs" methods, and appropriately taking care of the grazing, firewood, and intercropping needs of the people's communes and the broad masses of the people in various places, so as to combine current interests with long-term interests, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for desert control, and forming a mass movement in which everyone participates in desert control. At the same time, cultivating models, setting up pacesetters, and continuously carrying out evaluation and competition are also powerful measures to promote the mass desert control movement. In the past few years, we have cultivated two red flags for desert control in the western and eastern parts of the autonomous region, namely Bayangol City and Chifeng City. By summarizing and promoting experience, we have promoted desert control work throughout the region.
    Carrying out communist large-scale collaboration is an important measure for desert control. In the past few years, under the overall arrangement of the central government, we have established a joint closure and joint prevention system with neighboring provinces and regions, exchanging and supporting each other in terms of seeds and seedlings, and technology. We have organized close collaboration between relevant departments and regions within the region, and actively supported key desert control areas in terms of seeds and seedlings, labor, and technology. Relevant departments of the central government have also given us great support in materials and technology. These are important factors for the autonomous region to achieve brilliant achievements in desert control.
    Vigorously engaging in technological revolution, actively cultivating technical forces, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience in a manner that adapts to local conditions and times are important keys to carrying out desert control in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In the desert control movement, according to the practical experience of the people in the struggle against wind and sand disasters for many years, it has been proved that afforestation is an effective measure to eradicate the desert. In the past few years, we have selected fast-growing tree species on the edge of the desert, on the edge of farmland and pasture, and on both sides of railways and highways to build large-scale sand and wind prevention forest belts. On the inter-dune lowlands, flat sandy lands, and isolated and gentle sand dunes, we have built continuous fixed sand forests in accordance with local conditions. However, according to the requirements of plant growth conditions in the sandy areas, we planted suitable growing herbaceous plants in places where direct afforestation was not suitable at the beginning. In other words, in the specific measures for desert control, we implemented the principle of both grass and forest, adapting to local conditions, afforestation where possible, and grass planting where possible. In the afforestation and desert control movement, in addition to widely mobilizing the masses to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, creating and promoting new tools such as sand wormwood seeders, sandy land planting shovels, and young forest weeding machines, in the vast and sparsely populated desert, we are constantly expanding the use of aerial seeding methods, which has also powerfully promoted the progress of desert control work. In order to protect and develop vegetation in sandy areas and achieve the purpose of fixing and transforming deserts, in addition to vigorously afforestation and grass planting, it is also extremely important to enclose and protect shifting and semi-shifting sands with certain vegetation. Through methods such as rotational closure and grazing and mining small coal mines, we are effectively resolving the contradictions between desert transformation and grazing, firewood gathering, etc., and protecting and developing vegetation in sandy areas. Whether afforestation or grass planting requires water. In the past few years, we have used great efforts to dig wells, dig canals, and intercept floods to divert water to irrigate the sand, silt the sand, change the nature of the desert, and promote the growth of vegetation. These measures are organically connected, mutually supportive, and mutually useful. Because we adapt to local conditions in different regions, we have found a way to control the desert in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
    In the past few years, although Inner Mongolia has achieved great achievements in desert control and accumulated some experience, compared with the historical task of fundamentally transforming the desert, it has only opened up an advancing position. Now, the socialist construction of the country and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of comprehensive, high-speed, and sustained leap forward, and desert control work must be further strengthened, long-term planning, comprehensive management in stages and batches. Our preliminary plan is: starting from 1959, to basically control the shifting sands that endanger industrial, mining, transportation, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in three to five years, and strive to make all deserts basically covered with vegetation in ten years or a little longer. We will definitely be able to complete the historical task of desert control, so as to realize the grand ambition of conquering nature and transforming the appearance of the autonomous region, and transform the sandy areas into one of the socialist construction positions with green mountains, clear waters, pleasant climate, prosperity, and happiness, and contribute huge strength to the socialist construction of our great motherland of all ethnic groups.

    改造自然的巨大胜利
    中共内蒙古自治区党委书记内蒙古自治区副主席  王再天
    内蒙古自治区治理沙漠、征服自然的豪迈事业，随着社会主义建设的大跃进，已经进入全面改造的新阶段。这项伟大的共产主义的壮举，对迅速改变自治区的自然面貌，促进工农牧业的高速度发展和加速社会主义建设，有深远的意义。正如毛主席教导我们的“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。
    内蒙古幅员辽阔，资源富饶。这里有肥沃的良田，有广阔无垠的丰美草原，有像海洋般的大兴安岭林区，地下矿藏也极为丰富。但在解放前，由于国内反动派和帝国主义在政治上的长期统治，经济上的残酷掠夺和自然界的风化侵蚀等原因，致使森林受到了严重破坏，造成严重的水土流失，更加形成和扩大了沙漠。内蒙古各族人民，对于反动统治者这种破坏农田、牧场和山林的罪行，曾进行过无数次的英勇斗争；同时，由于身受沙漠的严重危害，曾自发地零星地进行过一些征服自然的斗争。但是，在当时的历史条件下，这种斗争是不容易取得胜利的。生活在风沙线上的各族人民只有度着“沙漠无情压良田，十家九户断炊烟”的凄惨生活。到解放时，内蒙古沙漠的面积已扩大到约占全区总面积的16％。在这些沙漠地带，气候干燥，雨量很少，流沙常年随风泛滥，淹没了不少农田、牧场、道路、桥梁，甚至有的村庄和渠道也被流沙夺去，严重影响着自治区工农牧业的迅速发展和国家社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    解放以来，内蒙古各族人民在党和政府的领导下，积极开展了对沙漠的治理工作。在经济恢复时期，曾大力进行了封沙育草育林工作，禁止乱垦乱伐，保护了沙区植被工作。接着在第一个五年计划建设时期，在农业合作化的基础上，结合各种生产建设，对直接危害农田牧场的沙漠开始了有计划的治理。从1958年大跃进以来，在全国第一次六省区治沙会议后，特别是在人民公社化的基础上，全面治沙、改造自然的宏伟工程进入了一个新的阶段。在内蒙古党委提出的“党委领导，政治挂帅，全党全民动员，全面规划，因地制宜，综合治理”的方针指导下，以乌兰布和、库布齐、毛乌素和腾格里等沙漠为重点，采取植树造林、种草、封沙育草育林、引水灌沙等办法，全面进军。现在，已有四万多平方公里约占17％的沙漠得到初步治理，半固定沙漠植物复被率已达到30％—50％，风沙危害显著减低；固定沙漠植物复被率一般达到了60％以上，现在不仅生长着种类繁多的草本植物和灌木，有的已生长起人工乔木和天然乔木。1953年开始营造的内蒙古东部防护林，包括三个盟的十三个旗、县、市，造林面积达一千多万亩，加上大面积的封沙育草育林，已经初步控制了流沙对农田牧场的危害。巴彦淖尔盟在乌兰布和大沙漠的边沿上营造的一条三百五十米宽、一百九十公里长的林草结合的绿色林带，像一座绿色长城，有效地控制了流沙东侵，保护了牧场、农田，并且向沙漠夺回四十多万亩农田和百万亩牧场。这些事实证明，狂暴的风沙不但可以被遏制和征服，而且在有些已治理的沙漠中，将重新收获到丰盛的农产品。当地人民欢唱“东临黄河西靠沙，造林育草好办法，十年苦战‘黄龙’（即风沙）伏，绿树丛中有人家”。
    今年的治沙工作，在普遍加强保护现有植被的基础上，特别加强了大造防沙林带，同时结合大面积地进行造林种草，今年将要完成的造林种草面积可达三百到四百多万亩，营造防沙林带数百公里。这样便可迅速地分割、包围沙漠，并有利于固定和根治沙漠，从而也就更能迅速有效地控制沙害，保证农牧业增产丰收，保障包兰铁路和黄河下游水利等工程的安全。
    在改造沙漠的群众运动中，我们的治沙队伍已经迅速成长起来。现在从自治区到沙漠地区的人民公社，都建立了治沙组织，在治沙重点地区已设立六十多个国营林场、治沙站和科学研究单位，从事治沙的专业干部和工人有三千多名，沙漠地区的人民公社的治沙专业队伍也有很大发展。目前，社队办林场已达九百多处，固定造林治沙人员八千八百多名。几年来，中央和内蒙古有关部门还派出了近千名干部和科学技术人员，对沙漠进行了全面考察。无疑地，这些都对今后进一步大规模治沙、征服自然奠定了胜利基础。
    内蒙古各族人民能够在短短的几年内，在治理沙漠上取得空前的巨大成就，是党和毛主席伟大民族政策的胜利，是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。
    治理沙漠、征服自然是伟大的革命事业，没有党的坚强领导是根本办不到的。党中央在1958年提出了向沙漠进军的号召后，受到了内蒙古各族人民的热烈响应。内蒙古各级党委和政府认真地贯彻执行了全国第一次六省区治沙会议制定的总方针，坚持开展了多快好省和少慢差费的两条道路、两种方法的斗争，通过全民整风和社会主义教育运动，向广大干部和人民群众大力宣传了治沙的重要性和可能性，批判了“治沙无劳力”和“治也治不住”等形形色色的右倾保守思想，坚定了人定胜天征服自然的共产主义的雄心大志，为胜利征服沙漠奠定了思想基础。
    要治理沙漠取得胜利，必须充分发动群众。在治沙运动中，我们一方面广泛动员一切力量，使各行各业在物资、技术上予以支援，另一方面充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，紧密结合农牧业生产，合理地安排了劳动力，贯彻执行了使专业组织长期准备和群众性的短期突击相结合，以群众为主、国营治沙和群众治沙相结合，以土法为主、土法治理与洋法治理相结合的一整套“两条腿走路”的方法，并适当照顾了各地人民公社和广大群众的放牧、樵采需要和林粮间种，使当前利益和长远利益结合起来，进一步调动了广大群众的治沙积极性，形成了大家动手治理沙漠的群众运动。与此同时，培养典型、树立标兵，不断开展评比竞赛，也是促进群众性治沙运动的有力措施。几年来，我们在自治区西部和东部分别培养了巴彦高勒市和赤峰市两面治沙红旗，通过总结与推广经验，推动了全区的治沙工作。
    开展共产主义大协作，是治理沙漠的重要措施。几年来，我们在中央的统筹安排下，与友邻省区建立了联封联防制度，在种苗、技术等方面互通有无，互相支援。在区内组织各有关部门和地区之间进行了密切协作，在种苗、劳力、技术等方面积极支援了重点治沙地区。中央有关部门在物资技术上还给了我们大力支援。这些都是自治区治沙工作取得辉煌成就的重要因素。
    大搞技术革命，积极培养技术力量，因地因时制宜地总结和推广先进经验，是多快好省地开展治沙事业的重要关键。在治沙运动中，根据人民群众多年来同风沙灾害斗争的实践经验，证明造林是根治沙漠的有效措施。几年来，我们在沙漠边缘、农田牧场边缘和铁路公路两侧，选用速生树种，营造了大面积的防沙防风林带，在丘间低地、平沙地和孤立平缓沙丘上，因地制宜地营造了成片固沙林。但根据沙区植物生长条件的要求，开始不宜直接造林的地方，便种植了适合生长的草木植物。这也就是说，在治沙的具体措施上，实行草林并举、因地制宜、能林则林、能草则草的原则。在造林治沙运动中，除广泛发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命、创造和推行了沙蒿播种器、沙地植树锹和幼林除草机等新工具外，在地广人稀的大沙漠上，正不断扩大使用飞机播种的方法，也有力地推动了治沙工作的进展。为了保护和发展沙区植被，达到固定和改造沙漠的目的，除大力造林、种草外，对有一定植被的流沙和半流沙，进行封育保护，也是极为重要的。我们通过轮封轮放和开采小煤窑等办法，正在有效地解决改造沙漠与放牧、樵采等方面的矛盾，保护和发展了沙区植被。无论造林、种草，都需要用水，几年来，我们曾用大力打井、挖渠、拦洪引水，以灌沙、淤沙，改变了沙漠性质，促进了草木生长。这些措施是有机联系，相辅相成，相互为用的。由于分别不同地区因地制宜，使我们找到了一条多快好省的治沙途径。
    几年来，内蒙古在治理沙漠方面虽然取得了很大成就，积累了一些经验，但和根本改造沙漠的历史任务比较起来，还仅仅是开辟了一个前进阵地。现在全国和内蒙古自治区的社会主义建设，已经进入全面的、高速度持续跃进的新阶段，治沙工作必须进一步加强领导，长期规划，分期分批地全面治理，综合治理。我们初步规划是：从1959年起，在三、五年内基本控制危害工矿、交通、农牧业生产的流沙，争取在十年或者更多一点的时间内，使全部沙漠基本上都有草木复被。我们一定能够完成治理沙漠的历史任务，从而实现征服自然、改造自治区面貌的宏伟志愿，把沙区改造成为山青水秀、风和日丽、繁荣幸福的社会主义建设阵地之一，为我们各民族伟大祖国的社会主义建设贡献出巨大力量。
