Xinhua News Agency, July 17th. The China Peace Committee today sent a telegram to the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and National Sovereignty, expressing firm support for the Cuban people's just struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and oppose U.S. imperialist intervention and aggression.

The telegram said: "Recently, the activities and clamor of U.S. imperialism to interfere in Cuba have intensified, constantly exerting economic pressure on Cuba and actively plotting military intervention. Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, has even blatantly clamored for the overthrow of the Cuban government, and U.S. warships have openly shelled the Cuban coast. However, the heroic Cuban people have united more strongly and are ready to fight back against the American aggressors at any time. The Cuban government has taken resolute counter-measures against U.S. economic and political pressure, and Cuban workers, farmers, and students have formed a powerful militia force. The anti-American demonstration of 500,000 people in Havana on July 10 once again demonstrated the Cuban people's fighting will and determination to defend their motherland and oppose American aggression. The Cuban people's just struggle has made great contributions to the national democratic movement in Latin America and to the cause of world peace, and has won the admiration and support of all oppressed nations and all peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people have always regarded the Cuban people's anti-American struggle as their own struggle and the Cuban people's victory as their own victory. As the Beijing people from all walks of life showed at the rally on July 16 to support the Cuban people's anti-American struggle, the Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of the heroic Cuban people. The Cuban people can always count on the full support of the 650 million Chinese people in the struggle against the common enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism. The current world situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the Cuban people's struggle. We firmly believe that the Cuban people's nationwide unity and unremitting struggle will eventually smash the interventionist conspiracy of the American aggressor group and achieve a complete victory in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty."

　　我和大致电古巴保卫和平与民族主权运动
　　中国人民永远支持古巴人民的斗争
    新华社17日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电古巴保卫和平与民族主权运动，表示坚决支持古巴人民维护民族独立和主权、反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的正义斗争。
    电报说：“最近美帝国主义干涉古巴的活动和叫嚣变本加厉，不断地对古巴实行经济压力和积极策划军事干涉。美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔更露骨地叫嚷要颠覆古巴政府，美国军舰更公然炮击古巴海岸。但是，英勇的古巴人民更加坚强地团结起来，随时准备着反击美国侵略者。古巴政府对美国的经济和政治压力采取了坚决反击措施，古巴的工人、农民和学生组成了强大的民兵武装，以及7月10日哈瓦那五十万人的反美大示威，再一次显示了古巴人民保卫祖国、反对美国侵略的战斗意志和决心。古巴人民的正义斗争为拉丁美洲的民族民主运动、为世界人民保卫和平的事业作出了伟大的贡献，受到全世界被压迫民族和一切爱好和平人民的敬佩和支持。“中国人民一向把古巴人民的反美斗争看作自己的斗争，把古巴人民的胜利看作自己的胜利。正如7月16日北京各界人民支援古巴人民反美斗争大会所表明，中国人民坚决站在英勇战斗的古巴人民这一边。古巴人民在反对全世界人民的死敌——美帝国主义的斗争中永远可以指望得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。现在的世界形势空前有利于古巴人民的斗争。我们坚信，古巴人民全国一致的团结和坚持不懈的斗争，终将粉碎美国侵略集团的干涉阴谋和取得维护民族独立与国家主权的彻底胜利。”
