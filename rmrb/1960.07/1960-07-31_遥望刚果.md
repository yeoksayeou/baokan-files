    Looking Towards Congo
    I, Kang Langshuai, a Dai ethnic singer, am harvesting the abundant double-crop rice in the commune by the Lancang River when suddenly, a piece of terrible news arrives from afar: Imperialism is staging a comeback, trying to nip the independent seedling in the bud; the peaceful villages of Congo are burning under the invaders' artillery fire. I clench the sickle in my hand, gazing at the flames rising from the Congolese villages, a surge of anger roiling in my heart! I am sitting in my bamboo house with my wife and children around the fire pit, drinking tea and singing songs, when suddenly the radio broadcasts the cries of Congolese children being slaughtered by the Belgian invaders. My aching heart feels like it's being twisted by knives. I hug my children, standing on the drying platform, looking towards distant Congo, and anger burns within me! Fight! Brave people of Congo! I am an ordinary Chinese farmer. In the years when my own country suffered invasion and enslavement, we too were persecuted and oppressed. Only after the red flag was raised in my country did we break the chains of slavery. Today, under the sunshine of the Party and Chairman Mao, we live in the happy ocean of our motherland. We understand the preciousness of happiness more than anyone else. We have never forgotten our suffering brothers around the world. Your misfortune and disaster make us hate imperialism even more. Fight! Brave people of Congo! Seize their weapons from the invaders. Strike hard at the invaders, drive all the beasts and demons out of the land of Congo! Fight! Brave people of Congo! We will pick the sweetest mangoes by the Lancang River and fill cups with fragrant sugarcane wine. When your triumphant songs are heard, we will raise our glasses to congratulate you!

    遥望刚果
    傣族歌手  康朗甩我正在澜沧江边收割着公社里丰收的双季稻，突然远方传来了一个噩耗：帝国主义正在卷土重来，想把独立的嫩苗掐掉；刚果和平的村寨，正在侵略者的炮火下燃烧。我握紧了手中的镰刀，遥望刚果村寨冒着的火苗，心里翻滚着一阵阵怒潮！我正在竹楼上和妻子儿女围着火塘，喝着清茶，唱着歌谣，突然广播器里传来了刚果孩子被比利时侵略者屠杀的啼叫。我疼痛的心仿佛被刀绞，我抱紧孩子，站在晒台上望着遥远的刚果，怒火在我身上燃烧！战斗吧！英勇的刚果人民！我是一个普通的中国农民，在我的祖国遭受侵略奴役的年代，我们也曾遭到迫害和欺凌。自从红旗在我的祖国升起，我们才打断奴隶的锁链，今天我们在党和毛主席的阳光下，生活在祖国幸福的海洋里，我们最懂得幸福的珍贵，我们从未忘记全世界受苦的兄弟，你们不幸的灾难，使我们更加对帝国主义仇恨。战斗吧！英勇的刚果人民！从侵略者手中夺过他们的武器。向侵略者狠狠的打击，把野兽和魔鬼统统赶出刚果的土地！战斗吧！英勇的刚果人民！我们在澜沧江边摘下最甜的芒果，斟满喷香的甘蔗酒，当你们胜利的凯歌传来时，我们将举杯向你们祝贺！〔陈贵培译〕
