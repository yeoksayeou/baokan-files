It is time to focus on “management.” From now until the autumn harvest, the most important task on the agricultural front is field management. “Three parts planting plus seven parts management ensures a safe ten-part harvest.” After completing the sowing tasks, the key to determining crop yield lies in field management.

This year's spring sowing and summer planting have achieved tremendous victories. The sown area is larger than in previous years, the sowing time is earlier than in previous years, and the quality of cultivation is higher than in previous years. Soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, and density have all been handled very well in several campaigns; the next step depends on how well field management (including "protection" and "management") is done. We already have the necessary conditions, and we must raise this year's field management work to a higher level.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the Party's leadership over the agricultural front has become increasingly strong and meticulous. We have gained rich experience in carrying out mass movements in production and construction, and we have also gained rich experience in improving the level of agricultural science and technology. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses and cadres closely combine many new creations after the great ideological liberation, the good methods of intensive cultivation accumulated over thousands of years, and the scientific knowledge obtained in the process of technological revolution. From practice and theory, we are rapidly raising China's agriculture to a new level and building a set of advanced agricultural science and technology with Chinese characteristics. The specific leadership work of the current field management should be viewed in such a broad and far-reaching context. At present, on the agricultural production front, our all-out struggle goal is to raise field management to the level of comprehensively and systematically implementing and developing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture." Analyze the experiences of various units that have achieved large-area high-yield harvests in recent years. The fundamental secret of high yield lies in striving to adapt the subjective efforts in cultivation to the objective laws of the crop itself and its natural environment, and at the same time, under the condition of mastering these laws, fully exert the powerful subjective initiative of the broad masses of commune members.

Through repeated practice and summarization, it is now becoming increasingly clear that the essence of field management, its most important general law, is the combination of actively promoting and appropriately controlling crops. Promoting means fully utilizing and increasing the favorable factors for crop growth, and meeting the nutritional needs of crops according to their different growth and development stages (that is, one "stage" after another), and creating conditions conducive to photosynthesis. First, it is necessary to achieve full seedlings, strong seedlings, uniform seedlings, and even seedlings; then, on this basis, proceed with strengthening stems, attacking ears, and increasing grains; advancing step by step, attacking one "checkpoint" after another, achieving strong stems, lush leaves, many ears (pods), large ears, and many, full grains (or cotton plants full of bolls, or increased weight of potato tubers). Controlling means striving to avoid and overcome unfavorable factors that are sufficient to harm the normal growth and reproduction of crops: on the one hand, constantly fighting against waterlogging, drought, wind, hail, pests, diseases, and weeds in a timely manner; on the other hand, preventing phenomena such as excessive growth, lodging, bud drop, boll drop, empty stalks, and empty shells that may occur in the crops themselves.

The two aspects of promoting and controlling cannot be neglected, and they must be closely coordinated. In general, promoting is the basic and main aspect of field management, and more and greater efforts should be used. Doing a good job in promotion is conducive to control; and the fundamental purpose of control is also for promotion. In some cases, such as when disasters are severe or crops are growing excessively, combating disasters and controlling excessive growth should be regarded as the main aspects of field management. When the two aspects of promoting and controlling are handled well and coordinated well, crops can grow and change in the healthiest direction conducive to high yields. If the two aspects of promoting and controlling are not handled properly, unfavorable situations will occur. For example, sometimes in order to promote vigorous crop growth, one-sided attention is paid to promotion while neglecting appropriate control, which will lead to excessive growth or delayed maturity; and sometimes in order to prevent disasters or prevent lodging, one-sided attention is paid to control while neglecting active promotion, which will also damage the crops. The two aspects of promoting and controlling cannot be completely separated. Sometimes, promoting methods are used to achieve the purpose of control, such as promoting strong seedlings and thick stems, which is closely related to preventing lodging and enhancing the crop's resistance to adversity; sometimes, controlling methods are used to achieve the purpose of promotion, such as controlling ineffective tillering and controlling excessive growth, which is related to strong stems, many ears, and many bolls. How to properly coordinate promotion and control is an important topic that we must continue to study in the practice of field management. The extent to which this problem is solved brilliantly is one of the main signs of the level of field management.

In the entire process of field management, from the two aspects of promoting and controlling, we must continue to pay close attention to the first few characters of the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture." In the seedling stage, special attention should be paid to the character "density": it is necessary to maintain a certain density by means of seedling supplementation and seedling protection, and also to control a certain density by means of thinning and transplanting. Throughout the entire field management period, what needs to be carefully handled is "water" and "fertilizer": it is necessary to fully meet the needs of crop growth and development, and strive to be timely, appropriate in quantity, and appropriate in method; it is necessary to actively open up new sources and pay attention to conservation; irrigate when dry and drain when flooded; prevent waterlogging when dry and prevent drought when flooded; use this kind of fertilizer for strong seedlings and that kind of fertilizer for attacking ears; consider the crops that are growing and also consider the next crop. "Water" and "fertilizer" should also be closely coordinated, and they should also be closely coordinated with intertillage. The art of field management lies mainly in the rational use of "water" and "fertilizer." The experience of labor model Chen Yongkang in using three yellows and three blacks in cultivating a season of late rice is an example. ("Three yellows and three blacks" refers to the process of the leaves of late rice changing from dark to light three times from transplanting to maturity. According to Chen Yongkang's experience, these six changes are phenomena that occur according to the growth and development law of late rice by applying fertilizer, irrigating, and draining water in a timely and appropriate amount.) In this regard, special attention should be paid to absorbing the existing rich experience, and continuing to carefully explore the law of rational use of "water" and "fertilizer" for various crops under various different conditions.

The above mainly talks about what things to do in field management, that is, the direction and goals of the struggle. Below, let's talk about how to do it, that is, how to strengthen and improve the leadership methods and style of field management. On this issue, various regions have also accumulated rich experience over the years. According to the existing experience, to do a good job in field management, the leadership must master the following key points:

1.  Overall planning, segmented management; manage as soon as planted, manage to the end. For the management work required for the entire process of crop growth, according to the law of crop growth, fully use scientific foresight to make an operational plan with echoes from beginning to end and connection between segments, and prepare the allocation of labor, the preparation of materials, and the training of technology in stages one step ahead of time. Attack one fortress after another, one checkpoint after another, one battle after another, one climax after another, until the final victory. This is what comrades in many places call: linking each ring tightly, not loosening one ring; promoting each move, not letting go of one move. There is particularly rich experience in "passing five checkpoints" for wheat in the past two years. For other crops, refer to the experience of wheat high yield to find out their respective "checkpoints."

2.  Manage early, the earlier the better; seize the opportunity, early is a hundred times early. Whether management is timely or not has a great impact on yield. In this sense, time is grain! Time is yield. Especially in summer, it is the season when crops grow most vigorously, and it is also the season when natural disasters are most frequent; the conditions for promotion are good, and the necessity of control is also great. Losing a day or two will cause great losses. Managing early means grasping each link early, especially grasping the management of the seedling stage early. Full, strong, uniform, and even seedlings are mainly determined in the seedling stage. If seedlings grow well, subsequent management work will be easier; early management of seedlings requires less effort and yields greater results. Intertillage, weeding, and pest and disease control are even more so. Doing it early will achieve twice the result with half the effort, and doing it late will achieve half the result with twice the effort. Early management promotes early tillering and early maturity, especially for cotton, which promotes early budding and early boll setting, which has a great relationship with improving yield and quality; in some areas, early management is also related to avoiding certain natural disasters. Looking further ahead, promoting the early maturity of this season's crops creates favorable conditions for planting the next season's crops early and well; looking closer, if the work that can be done early is done early, the arrangement of the entire summer production can be more proactive.

3.  Solid and practical, hard work and smart work; diligent and conscientious, meticulous management and careful management. There should be lofty ambitions to climb the highest peak of high yield, constantly revolutionizing, constantly moving upward, and constantly moving forward; to achieve this goal, field management should be better and better, and strive for perfection. One cannot be satisfied with a good foundation for planting, nor can one be satisfied with managing better than in the past. A good planting has laid a good foundation for more harvest. However, just like building a house, a good foundation does not equal a good house. Good planting should be managed even better in order to achieve the combination of two goods into one good and achieve the goal of high yield; if it is not managed well, even if it is planted well, all previous efforts will be wasted. In the early summer of this year, there was prolonged rain and low temperatures in many places in the south and northeast, and prolonged drought in many places in the north and southwest. Although spring-sown crops were planted well in some places, the emergence and growth conditions are still not very satisfactory. This requires strengthening field management, timely checking seedlings and replanting to achieve full and strong seedlings and overcome unfavorable natural conditions. Meticulous management and careful management not only means applying more fertilizer, watering more, tilling more, pruning more, and operating meticulously, but also striving to adapt to local conditions, adapt to the times, and adapt to the crops, so that manpower and materials are used at critical points. To improve the quality of meticulous management and careful management, there must be corresponding organizational measures, that is, organizing professional teams and strengthening the responsibility system. Professional teams do not exclude necessary large-scale cooperation. When necessary, large-scale cooperation should also be organized, and the responsibility system should also be strengthened in large-scale cooperation, with professional teams as the backbone.

4.  Pay attention to changes, make decisive decisions; be flexible and adaptable, adapt to changes. The growth and development of crops will change with the changes in management measures, and will also change with the changes in natural conditions. Everything is constantly changing, and some of the laws of change have not been fully mastered by us, and some changes are restricted by subjective and objective conditions and cannot be foreseen in advance. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to changes in all relevant aspects at any time, "look at the sky, look at the land, look at the crops," and the original management plan should be changed in a timely manner if it should be changed. For example, under normal circumstances, crops should be watered less or not watered at all during a certain period to prevent lodging or excessive growth; however, if the weather is particularly dry, it should still be watered appropriately during this period, because under this condition, water shortage is not conducive to crop growth and development and has become the main contradiction, and the possibility of lodging has become secondary in comparison. In short, it is necessary to master general laws, adhere to reasonable and correct management plans, and also adapt to changes in the situation and make appropriate modifications and supplements to the original management plans. The allocation of manpower and materials should also be adapted to these changes; in the event of sudden changes, it is often particularly necessary to give play to the wisdom of the broad masses and the power of large-scale cooperation.

5.  Focus on key points and manage comprehensively; learn from the advanced and increase production in a balanced way. From the central square (command field, experimental field), high-yield square to general field, low-yield field, a system should be formed that promotes and drives each other to strive for comprehensive high yield. It is necessary to grasp the high-yield square, make an example of carrying out field management work early, well, quickly, and skillfully, and drive the general field; it is also necessary to grasp the low-yield field, make an example of changing various unfavorable conditions subjectively and objectively, and promote the general field. This will achieve the goal of both improving yield per unit area and increasing total output. In short, in the entire process of field management, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of both multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high yield and multiple harvesting. For every point of land that is planted more, it is necessary to manage every point of land more. If there is more planting, can there be more management? Of course, compared with less planting, there will be more difficulties in management. The question is how to deal with difficulties. Since relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes, improving labor organization, vigorously carrying out tool reforms, and conquering difficulties such as insufficient land and insufficient labor, we have finally achieved the victory of expanding the sown area; we will certainly be able to overcome various difficulties and achieve the victory of comprehensively strengthening field management.

In order to ensure the completion of the major strategic task of a comprehensive agricultural harvest, we must resolutely continue to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. Leading cadres at all levels must go to the front line to personally participate in field management; at the same time, ensure that there is sufficient labor input into field management. By grasping this greatly, firmly, practically, and meticulously, and combining revolutionary vigor with a pragmatic spirit, we can raise field management to a higher level, raise agricultural output to a higher level, and raise people's political thought and China's agricultural science to a higher level.

### 把田间管理提到更高的水平

    把田间管理提到更高的水平
    是“管”字上马的时候了。从现在直到秋收，农业战线上最重要的任务就是田间管理。“三分种加七分管，十分收成才保险。”在完成播种任务之后，决定作物产量的关键就在于田间管理。
    今年的春播和夏种都获得了巨大的胜利。播种面积比往年大，播种时间比往年早，耕作质量比往年高。土、肥、水、种、密，在几个战役里都打得很漂亮；下一步，就看田间管理（包括“保”和“管”）干得如何了。我们已经具备必要的条件，一定要把今年的田间管理工作提高到一个更高的水平。
    大跃进以来，党对农业战线的领导越来越有力，越来越细致；既取得了在生产建设中大搞群众运动的丰富经验，也取得了提高农业科学技术水平的丰富经验。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，广大群众和干部把思想大解放以后的许多新创造、千百年积累起来的精耕细作的好办法和在技术革命过程中得到的科学知识密切结合起来，从实践上和理论上正在把我国的农业迅速地提高到一个新的水平，正在建设着一套富有我国特点的先进的农业科学技术。对于当前田间管理的具体领导工作，应该放在这样广阔深远的背景前边来看。当前，在农业生产战线上，我们全力以赴的奋斗目标是：把田间管理提高到全面地系统地贯彻执行和发展“农业八字宪法”的水平。试把几年来获得大面积高额丰产的各单位的经验分析一下，丰产的根本窍门都在于力求使耕作方面的主观努力适应作物本身及其自然环境的客观规律，同时在掌握这些规律的条件下充分发挥公社广大社员群众的强大的主观能动作用。
    通过反复的实践和总结，现在已经可以越来越清楚地看到：田间管理的实质，它的最重要的一般规律，就是对农作物进行积极促进和适当控制相结合。促进，就是充分利用和增加作物生长的有利因素，按照作物的不同的生长发育阶段（也就是一个又一个的“关”），来满足作物所需要的营养物质，来造成有利于光合作用的条件。首先要做到苗全、苗壮、苗齐、苗匀；然后在这基础上进行壮秆、攻穗、增粒；这样步步前进，攻打一个又一个“关口”，做到秆壮、叶茂，做到穗（荚）多、穗大，做到粒多、粒饱（或棉株满桃，或薯块增重）。控制，就是力求避免和克服足以危害作物正常生长和繁殖的不利因素：一方面，及时地不断地同水旱风雹灾害、病虫、杂草作斗争；另方面，防止作物本身可能发生的疯长、倒伏、落蕾、落铃、空秆、空壳等等现象。
    促进和控制这两个方面不可偏废，而且要使它们密切配合。在一般情况下，促进是田间管理基本的主要的方面，要用比较多比较大的力量。促进做得好，有利于控制；而控制的根本目的，也是为了促进。在某些情况下，如灾害严重或者作物疯长势头很旺的时候，就要把战胜灾害和控制疯长作为田间管理的主要方面。促进和控制两个方面处理得好，配合得好，就可以使作物最健康地向着有利于丰产的方向生长和变化。促进和控制两个方面处理得不适当，就会发生不利的情况。比如有时候为了促使作物长得茂盛，片面地注意促进而忽视适当控制，就会出现疯长或延迟成熟期的现象；又如有时候为了防止灾害或防止倒伏，片面地注意控制而忽视积极促进，也会使作物受到损害。促进和控制这两个方面也不能截然分开，有时候要用促进的方法达到控制的目的，如促使苗壮秆粗就同防止倒伏和增强作物的抗逆性有密切关系；有时候要用控制的方法达到促进的目的，如控制无效分蘖和控制疯长就同秆壮、穗多、桃多等有密切关系。促进和控制怎样适当配合才好，是我们要在田间管理的实践中继续不断研究的一个重要的课题。这个问题解决的高明不高明，是田间管理水平高低的主要标志之一。
    在田间管理的全部过程中，从促进和控制两个方面来说，对于“农业八字宪法”的头几个字都要继续密切注意。在幼苗期特别要注意“密”字：既要用补苗、保苗的办法来保持一定的密度，也要用间苗、移苗的办法来控制一定的密度。在整个田间管理期间，特别需要精心处理的是“水”和“肥”：既要充分满足作物生长发育的需要，又要力求适时、适量、方式适当；既要积极开源，又要注意节流；旱了要浇，涝了要排；旱时要防涝，涝时要防旱；壮苗要用这种肥料，攻穗要用那种肥料；要顾到正在生长的作物，还要顾到下一茬作物。“水”和“肥”之间也要密切配合，它们还要同中耕密切配合。田间管理的艺术，最主要的就在于“水”和“肥”的合理运用。劳动模范陈永康在栽培一季晚稻方面运用三黄三黑的经验就是范例。（“三黄三黑”是指晚稻从插秧到成熟叶色三次变浓、三次变淡的过程。根据陈永康的经验，这六次变化是按照晚稻的生长发育规律，适时适量地施肥、灌水、放水而出现的现象。）在这方面要特别注意吸取已有的丰富的经验，并且继续精心地探索各种作物在种种不同条件下合理运用“水”和“肥”的规律。
    以上主要谈的是在田间管理中要做些什么事情，也就是奋斗的方向和目标。下面，再来谈谈怎样做的问题，也就是加强和改进田间管理的领导方法和作风的问题。在这个问题上，各个地区几年以来也都有了很丰富的经验。根据已有的经验看来，要把田间管理工作做好，从领导方面来说必须掌握这样几个要点：
    一、统筹全局，分段管理；种下就管，一管到底。对作物成长的全部过程所需要的管理工作，要根据作物生长的规律，充分运用科学的预见性，作出首尾呼应、段段衔接的作业规划，把劳力的调配、物资的准备、技术的训练，都分阶段先一步准备好。一个堡垒又一个堡垒，一个关口又一个关口，一个战役又一个战役，一个高潮又一个高潮，攻打过去，直到最后胜利。这也就是很多地方的同志们所说的：环环扣紧，一环不松；着着促进，一着不让。对于小麦“过五关”，近两年有特别丰富的经验，对于其它作物，都要参照小麦丰产的经验，找出各自的“关”来。
    二、管理要早，越早越好；抓紧时机，一早百早。管理及时或者失时，对产量有极大的关系。在这个意义下，时间就是粮食！时间就是产量。特别是夏季，是作物生长最旺盛的季节，也是自然灾害最频繁的季节；促进的条件好，控制的必要性也大。失去一天半天的时机，都会造成很大的损失。管理要早，是指的每个环节都要早抓，特别是指的及早抓紧幼苗期的管理。苗全苗壮苗齐苗匀主要决定于幼苗期。幼苗长得好，以后的管理工作就比较好办；幼苗早管理，费力小而收效大。中耕除草和防治病虫害，更是如此，早了就会事半功倍，迟了就会事倍功半。早管理，促使早发棵，早成熟，特别是棉花，促使早现蕾，早结桃，对产量和质量的提高都有很大关系；在有些地区，管得早对于避开某些自然灾害也有一定关系。往远处看，促使这一季作物成熟得早，就为下一季作物种得早、种得好创造了有利条件；从近处看，能提早做的工作早做了，整个夏季生产的安排都可以更加主动。
    三、扎扎实实，苦干巧干；勤勤恳恳，精管细管。应当有攀登高产量的最高峰的雄心壮志，不断革命，不断向上，不断前进；为了达到这个目标，田间管理就要好上加好，精益求精。不能满足于种的基础好，也不能满足于比过去管得好。种得好，已为多收打下了好的基础。可是，就像盖房子一样，光是基础好，并不等于房子好。种得好，正应该管得更好，才能做到两好合一好，达到丰产的目的；如果管得不好，即使种得好也会前功尽弃。今年初夏南方和东北不少地方久雨低温，北方和西南不少地方长期受旱。有些地方春播作物虽然种得好，出苗和成长情况仍然不能令人十分满意。这就更要加强田间管理，及时查苗补种，以求苗全苗壮，战胜不利的自然条件。精管细管，不只是说要多追肥、多浇水、勤中耕、勤整枝和操作细致等等，还要力求作到因地制宜、因时制宜、因作物制宜，使人力物力用在节骨眼上。精管细管、提高田间管理质量要有相应的组织措施，就是组织专业队、加强责任制。专业队并不排斥必要的大协作。在必要的时候还要组织大协作，在大协作的时候同样要加强责任制，并且以专业队为骨干。
    四、注意变化，当机立断；灵活机动，随机应变。作物的生长发育状况，随着管理措施的变化会发生变化，随着自然条件的变化也会发生变化。一切事情都是不断变化的，而且有些变化的规律是我们还没有完全掌握住的，有些变化是受着主观和客观条件的限制未能事先预料到的。因此，必须随时留意各个有关的方面的变化，“看天，看地，看庄稼”，原定的管理计划该变就要及时地变。例如在一般情况下，作物在一定的时期要少浇水或者不浇水，以防止倒伏或疯长；可是，如果天气特别干旱，在这时期就还是应该适当浇水，因为在这情况下缺水不利于作物生长发育成为主要矛盾，相形之下，倒伏的可能性成为次要的了。总之，既要掌握一般规律，坚持合理的正确的管理计划，也要适应情况的变化，对原定管理计划作适当的修改、补充。人力、物力的调配，也要同这些变化相适应；在突然发生变化的情况下，往往特别需要发挥广大群众的智慧和大协作的威力。
    五、既有重点，又管全面；向上看齐，平衡增产。从中心方（指挥田、试验田）、丰产方到一般田、低产田，要组成一个互相促进、互相推动的争取全面丰产的系统。要抓紧丰产方，作出又早又好又快又巧地进行田间管理工作的榜样，把一般田带动起来；也要抓紧低产田，作出改变主观上和客观上的种种不利条件的榜样，把一般田推动起来。这样就能达到既提高单位面积产量又提高总产量的目的。总之，在整个田间管理过程中，要继续贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针。多种一分地，就要多管一分地。多种了，能不能多管呢？当然，比起少种来，管理起来会有较多的困难。问题在于应该怎样对待困难。既然依靠人民公社的强大力量，改进劳动组织，大搞工具改革，征服了土地不足、劳力不足等等困难，终于取得了扩大播种面积的胜利；也一定能克服种种困难，获得全面加强田间管理的胜利。
    为了确保完成农业全面丰收的重大战略任务，必须坚决地继续加强农业生产的第一线。各级领导干部要到第一线去亲自动手参加田间管理；同时要保证有足够的劳动力投入田间管理。这样大抓、狠抓、实抓、细抓，把革命干劲和求实精神合为一体，就能把田间管理提到一个更高的水平，把农业产量提到一个更高的水平，把人们的政治思想和我国的农业科学提到一个更高的水平。
