Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: According to Pyongyang newspapers today, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea replied to the Soviet Government on July 20th regarding the Soviet Government's note on the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference. The reply stated that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports and agrees with the completely correct measures taken by the Soviet Government in light of the fact that the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee was systematically sabotaged by the Western powers headed by U.S. imperialism. The reply also emphasized the Soviet government's consistent efforts for comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

The reply pointed out that due to the Western powers headed by U.S. imperialism stubbornly adhering to supervision and inspection without disarmament, which aims at espionage and reconnaissance of other countries' territories, especially socialist countries, the disarmament conference has been brought to a standstill.

The reply also pointed out that the aggressive bloc of Western powers headed by U.S. imperialism attempted to participate in disarmament talks in form to deceive the people on the one hand, and on the other hand, sent U-2 aircraft to violate Soviet airspace, systematically sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, and recently violated Soviet airspace again, which further blatantly exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

The reply condemned the aggressive policy adopted by U.S. imperialism to oppose socialist countries and intensify international tension, and exposed U.S. imperialism's frenzied support for West German revanchists and Japanese militarists, enabling them to be nuclear-armed, thereby increasing the danger of war.

The reply also condemned the U.S. imperialists for brutally suppressing the South Korean people in order to maintain their fascist rule in South Korea, and for conducting various military provocations more blatantly, especially recently for frantically increasing their troops in South Korea.

The reply emphasized that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people will further strengthen their struggle against the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The reply concluded by saying that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, will do everything possible to prevent war, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and safeguard peace and the victory of socialism.

    朝鲜政府就裁军会议复照苏联政府
    支持苏联对裁军会议的立场
    谴责美帝国主义对社会主义国家的侵略政策
    新华社平壤22日电　据平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在20日就苏联政府关于十国裁军会议的照会复照苏联政府，复照说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府完全支持和赞同在由于以美帝国主义为首的西方大国有计划地破坏十国裁军委员会的工作的情况下，苏联政府所采取的完全正确的措施。复照并强调了苏联政府为全面彻底裁军所作的始终一贯的努力。
    复照指出，由于以美帝国主义为首的西方大国顽固地坚持目的在于对别国领土、特别是对社会主义国家进行间谍侦察的没有裁军的监督和视察，使裁军会议陷于停滞不前的状态。
    复照还指出，以美帝国主义为首的西方大国侵略集团企图一方面在形式上参加裁军会谈，以欺骗人民；另一方面派遣了U—2型飞机侵犯了苏联领空，有计划地破坏了四国首脑会议，而且最近又侵犯了苏联领空，这进一步露骨地暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本性。
    复照谴责美帝国主义为了反对社会主义国家、加剧国际紧张局势而采取的侵略政策，并且揭露美帝国主义疯狂地扶植西德复仇主义者和日本军国主义者，使它们核武装化，从而增加了战争危险。
    复照还谴责美帝国主义者为了维持它在南朝鲜的法西斯统治，残酷地镇压南朝鲜人民，更加露骨地进行各种军事挑衅，特别是最近又疯狂地在南朝鲜增加它的兵力。
    复照强调说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民今后要进一步加强斗争，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策，使美帝国主义侵略军从南朝鲜撤走，以实现和平统一祖国。
    复照最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平人民一道，将为防止战争，为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为维护和平和社会主义的胜利尽一切努力。
