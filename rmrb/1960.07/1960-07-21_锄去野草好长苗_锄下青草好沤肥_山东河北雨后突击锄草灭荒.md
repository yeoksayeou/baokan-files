Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th - Shandong is concentrating labor to launch an emergency weed eradication campaign, combining weed removal with a mass movement to accumulate grass green manure. Statistics from the 15th show that 65% of the fields with weed infestation in the province have been weeded, and another 29 million mu of general fields have also been weeded.

The summer sowing work in Shandong Province has basically ended. Recently, various places have had successive rains, and weeds have grown rapidly after the rain, with some fields experiencing weed infestation. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently called on various places to launch an emergency weed eradication campaign, accumulate grass green manure on a large scale, and immediately set off two high tides of weeding and fertilizer accumulation. Up to now, the number of people participating in weeding in the province has reached more than 7.3 million. In Linqi, Changwei, Zibo, Liaocheng and other regions, more than 50% of the labor force has been invested in weeding and eliminating weeds. In weeding, many communes and teams first arrange the crops, land, and weeds, and make two sets of plans for sunny and rainy days according to seedlings, land, and weeds.

While weeding and eliminating weeds, fertilizer accumulation work in various places is also being carried out quickly and well. The one million-strong weeding army in the Zibo area is weeding and eliminating weeds on one hand, and digging pits on the spot to build green fertilizer on the other. Yuncheng County Shiji Commune, in conjunction with weeding and eliminating weeds, has also collected and stored 800,000 jin of forage grass, and collected some wild fibers and medicinal materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th - The vast number of commune members in various parts of Hebei are universally carrying out a field management movement centered on weeding and eliminating weeds, while seizing the opportunity after the rain to rush to plant summer crops. At present, the province has invested 4 million labor forces in this movement. According to statistics on July 14, the spring-sown crops have basically been weeded once, about one-half have been weeded twice, and some have been weeded three times, eliminating more than 4.7 million mu of weeds, and one-quarter of the spring-sown crops have been top-dressed and watered.

Since late June, most areas of Hebei Province have experienced rainfall. Due to drought-resistant sowing in the early stage, some crop fields could not be cultivated in time, so weeds grew quickly after the rain. In view of this situation, all localities enthusiastically responded to the call of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China to grasp planting with one hand and management with the other, and vigorously launch an emergency weed eradication campaign, and quickly set off a high tide of rushing to plant and rush to weed. Leading cadres of party committees at all levels personally went to the front line to focus on backward areas, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses, acting as both commanders and soldiers, and promoted the balanced development of the weeding and weed eradication movement. In the Chengde area, 26,000 cadres went to various places to participate in the weeding and weed eradication campaign under the slogan of "Go to the teams with poor conditions! Go to the deep mountains and valleys!"

In weeding and eliminating weeds, all localities actively created and promoted new-style summer weeding tools. Up to now, the province has created, modified, and used more than 590,000 pieces of new tools for cultivating and weeding.

Various industrial and commercial, cultural and educational departments and all walks of life vigorously support the rural people's communes in weeding and eliminating weeds. The province has invested about 1 million cadres, workers, employees on the financial and trade front, students, etc. in the weed eradication summer hoeing.

    山东河北雨后突击锄草灭荒
    据新华社济南20日电 山东各地正集中劳力突击锄草灭荒，结合锄草，掀起了大沤草绿肥的群众运动。15日统计，全省发生草荒现象的田地，已经锄了65％，另外还锄一般田地二千九百多万亩。
    山东省夏播工作已经基本结束。最近以来，各地先后下雨，雨后杂草丛生，少数田地发生了草荒现象。为此，中共山东省委最近号召各地，突击锄草灭荒，大积草绿肥，立即掀起锄草、积肥两大高潮。到目前止，全省参加锄草的人数已达七百三十多万人。临沂、昌潍、淄博、聊城等专区投入锄草灭荒的劳力达50％以上。在锄地中，很多社、队首先作好作物、土地、草荒的三排队，因苗、因地、因荒作出晴、雨两套打算。
    各地结合锄草灭荒，积肥工作也搞得又快又好。淄博地区的一百万锄草大军，一面锄草灭荒，一面就地刨坑积造绿肥。郓城县什集公社结合锄草灭荒还收贮饲草八十万斤，并采集了一部分野生纤维和药材。
    据新华社天津20日电  河北各地广大社员，在抓紧雨后时机突击夏种的同时，普遍开展以锄地灭荒为中心的田间管理运动。目前，全省投入这一运动的劳力已达四百万人，到7月14日统计，春播作物已基本锄完头遍，二分之一左右锄过二遍，部分已锄了三遍，消灭草荒四百七十多万亩，并有四分之一的春播作物已追上肥，浇了水。
    自6月下旬以来，河北省大部地区先后降雨。由于前期抗旱播种，部分作物田没能顾上及时中耕，因而雨后杂草生长快。根据这种情况，各地都热烈响应中共河北省委提出的一手抓种、一手抓管，大力突击锄草灭荒的号召，迅速掀起了抢种抢锄的高潮。各地党委领导干部都亲临第一线狠抓后进地区，与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，亦帅亦兵，推动锄地灭荒运动平衡发展。承德市地区有两万六千名干部，在“到条件差的队去！ 到深山沟去！”的口号下，分赴各地参加锄地抢荒大突击。
    各地在锄草灭荒中，都积极创制和推广新式夏锄工具。到目前止，全省已创、改、使用中耕锄草新工具五十九万多件。
    各地工商、文教部门和各行各业大力支援农村人民公社锄草灭荒。全省投入灭荒夏锄的干部、工人、财贸战线职工、学生等已达一百万人左右。
