Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd -- Amidst the anti-China and exclusion of Chinese activities stirred up by powerful groups in Indonesia, the Indonesian military authorities in West Java and other places, as well as soldiers and hooligans instigated or condoned, have adopted various brutal methods to savagely persecute overseas Chinese. The personal safety and property of overseas Chinese are under serious threat.

The West Java military authorities, notorious for their brutality and savagery in the large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese at the end of last year, have recently intensified their second large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese, and have once again resorted to violent means such as arrests, summonses, dispatching troops, police threatening with weapons, and sealing houses, infringing on the personal freedom and property of overseas Chinese.

On June 23, the West Java military authorities arrested two overseas Chinese in Cimahi and took them to military headquarters for interrogation and intimidation. On June 24, soldiers armed with wooden sticks and fully armed police forced overseas Chinese to move in Cimahi, and unreasonably cut off the power supply to overseas Chinese families who were ordered to relocate. The Ujungberung military authorities also constantly summoned overseas Chinese who were ordered to relocate, even threatening to "create bloodshed" to implement the forced relocation.

During the large-scale forced relocation by the West Java military authorities, incidents of seizing overseas Chinese houses also occurred frequently. In Bandung and its surrounding areas, more than 80% of the houses of overseas Chinese who had completed procedures to return to China had been sealed. The wartime ruler of Ciberian State summoned twenty people living in houses formerly owned by overseas Chinese on June 23 and ordered them to move out of these houses within a week. Some Indonesian soldiers in West Java often unreasonably seized overseas Chinese residences.

In Cimahi, Lembang, and Majalaya, which belong to Bandung County and are currently undergoing large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese, all houses inhabited by overseas Chinese have been sealed and are not allowed to be sold.

These atrocities by the West Java military authorities are reminiscent of their disgraceful record during the first large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese at the end of last year. When the forced relocation began on November 3 last year, the military authorities of Sukabumi County in West Java, together with the local troops and police in Cibadak, carried out armed forced relocation, and overseas Chinese Fang Chengshan and Huang Chengdun were beaten and injured. Even a seventy-year-old overseas Chinese woman with impaired vision was tragically knocked to the ground. By the end of November, armed military police fired warning shots to force the last batch of overseas Chinese to leave Cibadak. Even more appalling, when the West Java military authorities forcibly relocated overseas Chinese in Cileungsi on November 12 last year, the soldiers rudely dragged an overseas Chinese woman who had just undergone surgery and was recently discharged from the hospital onto a car, causing the wound sutures to come loose and bleed profusely. In the Rawang area of ​​Panjalu County, eight overseas Chinese were beaten by Indonesian soldiers. In Cilamaya, Karawang County, dozens of military police officers rushed into overseas Chinese residences and beat them behind closed doors. The entire family of overseas Chinese Lai Yuelong and Xiao Yulin were beaten, Xiao Yulin was knocked unconscious, his daughter was molested by an Indonesian military officer, and his son was also severely beaten for protesting. The sixty-year-old overseas Chinese Lin Congfang was severely beaten by Indonesian military police, and his son was also beaten unconscious when he stepped forward to stop them. Subsequently, these military police also lifted him high and threw him to the ground, causing serious injuries.

Overseas Chinese who could not migrate on schedule due to various difficulties were treated as "criminals" who violated the law and were sentenced and imprisoned. At the end of December last year, the Bogor District Court sentenced thirty-six overseas Chinese to prison terms ranging from twenty to forty days for failing to accept forced relocation. In early December last year, 165 overseas Chinese parents in the Ciamis District were imprisoned in military detention camps. In Cirebon, twenty-nine overseas Chinese parents were also imprisoned in military detention camps for the same crime.

In addition to West Java, incidents of killing overseas Chinese, looting overseas Chinese property, and raping overseas Chinese women have repeatedly occurred in various outer islands of Indonesia over the past year.

In June last year, after Lieutenant Junior Marpaung, a local military officer in Segi Empat, Bagan Siapi-api, Riau Province, murdered Indonesian officer Captain Siahann, who went to combat smuggling, he ordered the shooting of overseas Chinese who witnessed the incident to silence them. Three overseas Chinese were shot dead on the spot, and three were injured. The Chinese Consulate in Medan has lodged a protest with the relevant Indonesian authorities regarding this case of brutal killing of overseas Chinese, requesting serious handling. However, the murderer is still at large and continues to hold his position.

In the Batam area of ​​Riau, Medan, Belitung, and rural areas of Molefen, there have been incidents of soldiers, hooligans, and thugs who were instigated or condoned killing overseas Chinese.

In some Indonesian cities, incidents of Indonesian anti-China elements provoking overseas Chinese in groups have also occurred. In Semarang, organized anti-China elements have repeatedly smashed overseas Chinese shops and distributed anti-China leaflets. In Surabaya, on the evening of December 6 last year, four overseas Chinese students and one overseas Chinese teacher were beaten for no reason by groups of hooligans, and two overseas Chinese were seriously injured as a result.

In West Kalimantan, Ratu Bono, an armed policeman from Wanna, deliberately went to the shop of overseas Chinese Lin Daoquan in October last year to provoke him, pinched Lin Daoquan's wife's nose to insult her, and finally used a pistol handle to beat her, causing her mouth to swell and bleed.

In September last year, in Dong Wanlu, West Kalimantan, district head Simbolon and village head Muhammad Nur Nasution and four others lured two overseas Chinese women to the local post office and forcibly raped them.

In Liegang, Bangka, a local soldier extorted money from Yuan Guande, a young overseas Chinese who was preparing to return to China, when he was selling his radio. Later, when this soldier went to his home to extort money again and failed, he attempted to attack with a knife. Yuan Guande disarmed him in self-defense, and his entire family was arrested and severely beaten in the military camp, some of whom were seriously injured as a result. Some victims were detained for more than ten days after receiving treatment in the hospital. After the incident, local overseas Chinese groups complained to the military authorities, but the murderer is still at large. On May 7 this year, Lieutenant Maniar, a soldier from the Nambah area of ​​Deli Serdang County, North Sumatra, and the district head and others, formed an "assessment committee" to forcibly buy the shop of overseas Chinese Cai Fushou at a low price and demanded that he move out within a time limit. Cai Fushou reasoned with them, but was beaten by Lieutenant Maniara.

The above-mentioned atrocities have aroused strong indignation among overseas Chinese in various parts of Indonesia, who feel that the safety of their lives and property is under great threat. They demand that the Indonesian authorities punish the murderers and those responsible for creating the incidents, compensate the overseas Chinese for their losses, and prevent similar incidents from happening.

    印度尼西亚地方军事当局排华手段日益野蛮
    西爪哇华侨生命财产受到严重威胁
    西爪哇军事当局在第二次大规模迫迁华侨活动中，一再使用逮捕、传讯、派军队、警察持武器威胁、标封房屋等暴力手段，侵犯华侨人身自由和财产。
    新华社2日讯　在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的反华排华活动中，印度尼西亚西爪哇和其他一些地方军事当局以及受人指使或纵容的军人、流氓，采取种种残暴手段，对华侨进行野蛮的迫害。华侨的人身安全和财产受到严重威胁。
    曾经在去年底的大规模迫迁华侨活动中以残暴和野蛮而臭名昭彰的西爪哇军事当局，最近在加紧进行第二次大规模迫迁华侨的活动中，再次发生使用逮捕、传讯、派军队、警察持武器威胁、标封房屋等暴力手段，侵犯华侨人身自由和财产。
    6月23日，西爪哇军事当局逮捕了芝马圩的两名华侨，押往军部去进行审讯和恐吓。6月24日，手持木棍的军人和全副武装的警察到芝马圩强迫华侨迁移，还无理地切断了被勒令迫迁的华侨家庭的电源供应。乌绒不龙军事当局也不断地传讯被勒令迫迁的华侨，甚至威胁说，不惜“制造流血事件”来实行迫迁。
    在西爪哇军事当局大规模迫迁的同时，强占华侨房屋的事件也层出不穷。在万隆市和所属地区，已有80％以上已办完回国手续的华侨的住屋被贴上封条。西勃良安州的战时掌权者在6月23日还传讯了住在原先华侨所有的房子里的二十个人，限令他们一星期内迁出这些屋子。西爪哇印度尼西亚的一些军人还往往无理强占华侨住宅。
    在属于万隆县的最近正在大规模强迫华侨迁移的芝马圩、连旺和马者拉夜等地，所有华侨居住的房子，都被贴上封条、不准出卖。
    西爪哇军事当局这些暴行令人回想起他们在去年底第一次大规模迫迁华侨活动中的可耻纪录。去年11月3日开始施行迫迁时，西爪哇苏甲武眉县军事当局会同芝巴德当地军队、警察进行武装迫迁，华侨方成山和黄成敦被毒打受伤。甚至一位双目失明的七十多岁的华侨妇女也悲惨地被打倒在地。到11月底，武装军警为迫使最后一批华侨迁离芝巴德，竟然鸣枪示威。更加令人发指的是，西爪哇军事当局在去年11月12日在芝灵诗使用武力强迫华侨迁移时，军人竟蛮横地把刚刚经过手术治疗出医院不久的一个华侨妇女硬拖上车，致使伤口缝线脱落，大量流血。在板宜格冷县拉挽地区，有八名华侨被印度尼西亚军人打伤。在加拉横县芝拉马夜，几十名军警冲进华侨住宅，闭门围殴华侨。华侨赖跃龙和肖玉磷等全家老少被打，肖玉磷被打晕倒在地，他的女儿受到一名印度尼西亚军官的调戏，他的儿子表示抗议，也遭到毒打。六十多岁的华侨林聪访被印度尼西亚军警毒打，他的儿子上前阻拦，也被打得不省人事，随后，这些军警还把他高高抬起，抛摔地上，使成重伤。
    因种种困难不能按期迁移的华侨，竟被当作犯法的“罪犯”加以判刑和关禁。茂物区法院在去年12月下旬以没有接受迫迁为罪名，把三十六名华侨判处二十天到四十天不等的徒刑。在去年12月初，尖美士区有一百六十五名华侨家长被关进军事拘留营。在井里汶，有二十九名华侨家长也因同样罪名被关进军事拘留营。
    除西爪哇外，印度尼西亚其他岛屿外岛各地在过去一年中，也屡次发生杀害华侨、掠夺华侨财产、奸污华侨妇女的事件。
    去年6月，在廖内省巴眼阿比附近的四角芭当地军官马尔巴袞少尉谋杀了前往缉私的印度尼西亚军官西亚汗上尉之后，为了灭口，下令向目击这一事件的华侨开枪，当场有三名华侨被打死，三名被打伤。中国驻棉兰领事馆曾经就这一华侨被惨杀的案件向印度尼西亚有关当局提出了照会，要求作严肃的处理。但是，杀人犯却至今仍然逍遥法外，照常任职。
    在廖内巴淡区、棉兰市、勿里洞、茉莉芬乡下都有受指使或受纵容的军人、流氓和恶棍杀害华侨事件。
    在一些印度尼西亚城市中，还发生了印度尼西亚排华分子成群结队向华侨挑衅的事件。在三宝垄，有组织的排华分子数次捣毁华侨商店和印发排华传单。在泗水，去年12月6日晚上有四名华侨学生和一名华侨教师被成群的流氓无端殴打，两名华侨因此受重伤。
    在西加里曼丹的万那武装警察拉图波诺曾在去年10月故意到华侨林道泉的商店里去挑衅捏住林道泉的妻子的鼻子进行侮辱，最后用短枪柄把她打得口角青肿流血。
    去年9月，在西加里曼丹东万律，区长西姆博仑和村长穆罕默德·努尔·纳苏蒂安等四人诱骗两个华侨妇女到当地驿舍，强行轮奸。
    在邦加的烈港，当地一名军人曾向准备回国的青年华侨袁官德在变卖自己的收音机时进行勒索。后来这个军人在到他的家里再行勒索不遂时竟企图持刀行凶。袁官德为了自卫将他的刀击落，竟至全家被抓到军营受毒打，其中有数人因此受伤很重。有些受害者在医院治伤后还受到拘留达十多天之久。事件发生后，当地华侨团体曾向军事当局控诉，但是，凶手至今仍逍遥法外。今年5月7日，北苏门答腊日里雪里冷县南吧区军人马尼亚拉中尉和当地区长等人组成的“估计委员会”强迫低价购买华侨蔡福寿的店面，并要限期搬出。蔡福寿据理申诉，竟遭马尼亚拉中尉殴打。
    上述这些暴行在印度尼西亚各地的华侨当中引起强烈的愤慨，他们感到生命财产的安全受到极大的威胁。他们要求印度尼西亚当局惩办凶手和制造事件的负责人，赔偿华侨所受损失，并防止类似事件的发生。
