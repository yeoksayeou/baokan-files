Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this afternoon, representing 650 million Chinese people in expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China, said in his speech: "The Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland will always receive the full support of the 650 million Chinese people." Tran Trong Quat, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, said in his speech: "US imperialism and its running dogs, the traitorous Ngo Dinh Diem clique, will surely suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people. Vietnam will surely be reunified!"

Today, the Great Hall of the People, the venue of the conference, was filled with a strong atmosphere of Sino-Vietnamese friendship and support for the Vietnamese people's opposition to US imperialist aggression. At 3:40 p.m., Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premier of the State Council, Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China, and others, along with Tran Trong Quat, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and his wife, walked onto the rostrum amidst majestic military music. At this time, ten thousand people in the hall stood up and applauded thunderously.

Also seated on the rostrum were Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and others.

Today's meeting was presided over by Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association. He delivered the opening remarks, saying: "The Chinese people firmly support the patriotic and just struggle launched by the heroic Vietnamese people, and pay them the highest respect."

Yang Xiufeng said: "As everyone knows, the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina were signed six years ago, but due to the obstruction and sabotage of US imperialism, the Vietnamese people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland has not yet been realized." "All the Vietnamese people are increasingly aware that US imperialism is the enemy of Vietnam's peaceful reunification and the root cause of all the disasters of the people of South Vietnam. As long as the US aggressor forces remain in South Vietnam, the Vietnamese people's urgent desire for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland cannot be realized, and the peace and security of Vietnam and Indochina cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the struggle against US imperialism is the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the struggle to liberate the people of South Vietnam, and the struggle to defend peace in Indochina and Asia."

Yang Xiufeng said: "The Chinese and Vietnamese people are as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. We have forged a fighting brotherhood in the long-term struggle against imperialism. US imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of the Vietnamese people, but also the deadly enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The 650 million Chinese people will always support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland. The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people will unite even more closely, and together with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, we will fight to the end to completely smash the US imperialist policy of aggression and war schemes, and defend world peace."

Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China, spoke at the meeting.

Liu Ningyi severely condemned the US government's criminal acts of brutally trampling on and undermining the Geneva Accords over the past six years. He said: "These criminal activities of US imperialism once again demonstrate that imperialism is unwilling to abide by international agreements that are conducive to peace, and always tries every possible means to undermine them. The aggressive activities of US imperialism have profoundly educated the people of Indochina from the negative side, making them more closely united and carrying out a resolute struggle against US imperialism."

Liu Ningyi said: "Now, the large-scale movement of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland is surging forward. The flames of anger against US imperialism and its running dogs are spreading throughout Vietnam. The US-Ngo clique is trapped in the encirclement of the Vietnamese people, and their days are numbered." "The Vietnamese people's patriotic and just struggle is an important part of the struggle of the people of the world against US imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace. The Vietnamese people's struggle not only severely hit the reactionary rule of the US-Ngo clique in South Vietnam and strongly supported the national and democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also made ever greater contributions to the cause of world peace. Socialist countries and all peace-loving people and countries stand with the heroic Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people's struggle is never isolated."

Liu Ningyi said: "The Chinese and Vietnamese people have a traditional and profound friendship. We have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle against imperialism. The victory of the Vietnamese people is the victory of the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland will always receive the full support of the 650 million Chinese people. The US government must strictly abide by the provisions of the Geneva Accords. All US military personnel and various weapons that have illegally entered South Vietnam must be completely withdrawn. Vietnam belongs to all the Vietnamese people, and no foreign interference can stop the Vietnamese people's firm will to peacefully reunify their fatherland. The Chinese people firmly believe that with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people and countries, the Vietnamese people's just struggle will surely achieve victory, and the great rivers and mountains of Vietnam, from Lang Son to Ca Mau, will eventually be reunified."

Tran Trong Quat, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, was invited to speak at the meeting. In his speech, he exposed with a large number of facts the crimes of US imperialism in trying every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords over the past six years, and pointed out that these crimes of the United States have caused a serious threat to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Tran Trong Quat said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to unswervingly pursue a policy of peaceful reunification and make unremitting efforts to correctly implement the Geneva Accords. At present, it is necessary to immediately stop the US imperialist policy of intervention and provocation in South Vietnam; to demand that the US Military Assistance Advisory Group immediately get out of South Vietnam; to demand an immediate end to the persecution and retaliation against former resistance personnel and those who love their country and peace. The South Vietnamese authorities must negotiate with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to organize free and general elections for the purpose of unifying the motherland. This policy has received the warm support of all the Vietnamese people."

Tran Trong Quat said: "Our struggle has received the warm support and selfless assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the people and governments of many Asian and African countries, as well as the peace-loving people of the world, have expressed their sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people." He said: "The Chinese people and the Chinese government are close comrades-in-arms and loyal comrades of the Vietnamese people, and have always been concerned about and fully supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and reunification." Tran Trong Quat concluded: "The Vietnamese people believe that US imperialism and its running dogs, the traitorous Ngo Dinh Diem clique, will surely suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people. Vietnam will surely be unified!"

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland. He said: "The crimes of US imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in undermining the Geneva Accords, obstructing Vietnam's peaceful reunification, and threatening peace in Asia and the world, have aroused increasing indignation among the Vietnamese people." Liu Changsheng pointed out: Recently, the Vietnamese people's struggle has further developed. Opposition to US imperialism and its running dogs and the realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland are the common aspirations of all the Vietnamese people, and no force can stop them.

Liu Changsheng said: "The Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland has made a significant contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people's struggle has received the full support of the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the support of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries and peace-loving people all over the world. The 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Vietnamese people and fight to the end against our common enemy, US imperialism. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's just struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland will surely achieve final victory. US imperialism get out of South Vietnam!"

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, spoke on behalf of the democratic parties. He resolutely stated on behalf of the democratic parties: "We oppose US imperialism's undermining of the Geneva Accords, obstructing Vietnam's reunification, and plotting to turn South Vietnam into a US imperialist military base and colony, and we support the Vietnamese people's patriotic and just struggle."

Shen Junru said: The actions of US imperialism in South Vietnam over the past six years have made it even clearer to the Vietnamese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world that US imperialism is the most ferocious common enemy of the people of the world. The Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialism has become a part of the anti-American storm worldwide.

Shen Junru said: "China and Vietnam are brotherly countries as closely related as lips and teeth. The people of our two countries have forged revolutionary friendship in the struggle for national liberation and against imperialism. The life and death of the Vietnamese people are closely related to the Chinese people. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Vietnamese people and vow to fight US imperialism to the end together with the Vietnamese people!"

Shen Junru said: "The current international situation has clearly shown that imperialism is rotting day by day, and the big and small running dogs it raises are falling one by one under the iron fists of the people. Ngo Dinh Diem will share the same fate as Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Kishi Nobusuke, and will eventually be thrown into the garbage dump by the people. The heroic Vietnamese people, having been able to defeat the French colonialists and American interventionists in the past, will surely be able to drive out the American aggressors today. The Vietnamese people's desire to realize the peaceful reunification of their fatherland cannot be stopped by any force."

All the speeches at the meeting were greeted with extremely warm applause.

After the speeches, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China, read out the telegram from the conference to the Vietnamese people. The conference passed this telegram amidst a storm of applause, expressing the firm support of the more than 600 million Chinese people for the just struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

People from all walks of life in the capital attended today's meeting, including Zhang Xiruo, Luo Guibo, Chu Tunan, Shi Liang, Ding Xilin, Yang Mingxuan, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Zhang Zhixiang, Feng Jiping, Sun Xiaocun, Wang Jiong, Wang Zhaohua, Zhang Jinlin, and Wang Chunheng. He Wei, Chinese Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Fang Yi, Economic Representative, also attended the meeting.

Envoys and diplomatic officials from various socialist countries stationed in China, attachés from the Indonesian Embassy in China, some foreign guests from Asian, African, and Latin American countries in Beijing, foreign experts, diplomatic officials from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, Vietnamese students and interns, were all invited to attend the meeting.

　　支持越南人民反对侵略统一祖国
　　刘宁一、杨秀峰、陈仲括临时代办、刘长胜、沈钧儒在会上讲了话
　　表示在反帝斗争中永远互相支持，坚信越南人民正义斗争必获胜利
    据新华社19日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午举行盛大集会，代表六亿五千万中国人民表示坚决支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争。
    中共中央委员、中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一在讲话中说：“越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争，将始终得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。”越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办陈仲括在讲话中说：“美帝国主义和它的走狗、卖国的吴庭艳集团一定会遭到可耻的失败。最后胜利一定是属于越南人民的。越南一定会统一！”
    今天，作为大会会场的人民大会堂里，充满中、越友谊和支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的强烈气氛。下午三时四十分，国务院副总理习仲勋，中越友好协会会长杨秀峰，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等，同越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办陈仲括和夫人，在雄壮的军乐声中走上主席台。这时，会场上万人起立，掌声雷动。
    在主席台上就座的还有中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜，中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉等。
    今天的大会由中越友好协会会长杨秀峰主持。他致开会词说：“中国人民坚决支持英雄的越南人民所展开的爱国正义斗争，并向他们致以最崇高的敬意。”
    杨秀峰说：“大家知道，关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议已经签订六年了，但是由于美帝国主义的阻挠和破坏，越南人民渴望祖国和平统一的愿望至今未能实现。”“全体越南人民越来越认清，美帝国主义是越南和平统一的敌人，是越南南方人民一切灾难的根源。美国侵略势力一天呆在越南南方不走，越南人民要求和平统一祖国的迫切愿望就一天不能实现，越南和印度支那的和平和安全就一天得不到保障。因此，反对美帝国主义的斗争，就是争取和平统一祖国的斗争，就是解救越南南方人民的斗争，就是保卫印度支那和亚洲和平的斗争。”
    杨秀峰说：“中国人民和越南人民唇齿相依，休戚与共。在长期的反对帝国主义的斗争中结成了战斗的兄弟友谊。美帝国主义不仅是越南人民的死敌，也是中国人民和全世界人民的死敌。六亿五千万中国人民永远支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争。中国人民与越南人民将更加紧密地团结起来，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国及全世界人民一起，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争阴谋，保卫世界和平而斗争到底。”
    中共中央委员、中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一在会上讲话。
    刘宁一严厉谴责了美国政府六年来对日内瓦协议进行粗暴蹂躏和破坏的罪恶行为。他说：“美帝国主义的这些罪恶的活动，再一次说明了帝国主义对于有利于和平的国际协议是不愿意遵守的，总是要千方百计地加以破坏。美帝国主义的侵略活动，深刻地从反面教育了印度支那各国人民，使他们更加紧密地团结起来，向美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。”
    刘宁一说：现在，越南人民所掀起的大规模反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争运动，正在汹涌澎湃地向前发展。反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争怒火，正在燃遍整个越南。美吴集团正陷入越南人民的包围之中，他们的寿命不会很长了。“越南人民的爱国正义斗争是全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争的一个重要部分。越南人民的斗争不仅沉重地打击了美吴集团在越南南方的反动统治，有力地支持了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族、民主运动，而且对于世界和平事业做出了越来越大的贡献。社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的人民和国家都同英勇的越南人民站在一起，越南人民的斗争永远不是孤立的。”
    刘宁一说：“中越两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。我们在反对帝国主义的斗争中一向互相同情，互相支援。越南人民的胜利就是中国人民的胜利。越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争，将始终得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。美国政府必须严格遵守日内瓦协议的各项规定。美国非法进入越南南方的军事人员和各种武器必须全部撤出。越南是属于全体越南人民的，任何外国的干涉都不能阻挡越南人民和平统一自己祖国的坚定意志。中国人民坚信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民和国家的大力支持下，越南人民的正义斗争一定能够获得胜利，从谅山到金瓯的越南大好河山，最终必将获得统一。”
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办陈仲括应邀在大会上讲话。他在讲话中以大量的事实揭露了六年来美帝国主义千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，并且指出美国的这些罪行已经给印度支那和东南亚的和平造成了严重的威胁。
    陈仲括说：“越南民主共和国政府将继续始终不渝地奉行和平统一的政策，并为正确履行日内瓦协议进行不懈的斗争。目前是要求立即制止美帝国主义在越南南方的干涉和挑衅政策；要求美国军事援助顾问团立即从南越滚出去；要求立即停止对前抗战人员和对爱祖国爱和平的人士所采用的迫害和报复手段。要求南越政权必须和越南民主共和国政府进行协商，以利组织目的在于统一祖国的自由普选。这个政策已获得全体越南人民的热烈支持。”
    陈仲括说：“我们的斗争事业已得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的热烈支持和无私的帮助，许多亚非国家的人民和政府以及世界爱好和平的人民，曾经对越南人民正义的斗争表示同情和支持。”他说：“中国人民和中国政府是越南人民亲密的战友和忠实的同志，一向关心和全力支持越南人民争取独立和统一的斗争。”陈仲括最后说：“越南人民相信，美帝国主义和它的走狗、卖国的吴庭艳集团一定会遭到可耻的失败。最后胜利一定是属于越南人民的。越南一定会统一！”
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜代表中华全国总工会、中国共产主义青年团、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会讲话，坚决支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争。他说：“美帝国主义和它的走狗吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议、阻挠越南和平统一、威胁亚洲和世界和平的罪行，已经激起了越南人民越来越大的义愤。”刘长胜指出：最近一个时期，越南人民的斗争有了进一步的发展。反对美帝国主义及其走狗、实现祖国的和平统一，是全体越南人民的共同愿望，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    刘长胜说：“越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的斗争，对保卫亚洲和世界的和平作出了重大的贡献。越南人民的斗争得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的全力支持，得到了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。六亿五千万中国人民将永远同越南人民在一起，为反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争到底。我们坚信越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争一定会取得最后胜利。美帝国主义从南越南滚出去！”
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒代表各民主党派讲话。他代表各民主党派坚决表示：“我们反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议、阻挠越南统一，阴谋变越南南方为美帝国主义的军事基地和殖民地，我们支持越南人民爱国正义的斗争。”
    沈钧儒说：六年来，美帝国主义在越南南方的所作所为更加清楚地告诉了越南人民、亚洲人民和世界人民，美帝国主义是世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人。越南人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争，成为全世界范围内反美风暴的一部分。
    沈钧儒说：“中越两国是唇齿相依的兄弟之邦，我们两国人民早在争取民族解放、反对帝国主义的斗争中，已结成了革命的友谊。越南人民的生死存亡，是和我们中国人民休戚相关的，中国六亿五千万人民坚决支持越南人民的爱国正义斗争，誓与越南人民一起同美帝国主义斗争到底！”
    沈钧儒说：“目前的国际形势已经很清楚地看出了，帝国主义是在一天天地烂下去，他所豢养的大大小小的走狗们，在人民的铁拳下，一个个地倒下去了。吴庭艳将和李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介的命运一样，最终必被人民丢到垃圾堆里。英勇的越南人民过去既然能够战胜法国殖民者和美国干涉者，今天也必然能够赶走美国侵略者。越南人民实现祖国和平统一的愿望，是任何力量也不能阻挡的。”
    在大会上的所有讲话，都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    讲话以后，中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全宣读大会致越南人民电。大会在暴风雨般的掌声中通过了这个电报，表示六亿多中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争。
    首都各方面的人士参加了今天的大会，他们当中有张奚若、罗贵波、楚图南、史良、丁西林、杨明轩、欧阳予倩、老舍、张致祥、冯基平、孙晓村、王炯、王照华、张进霖、王春平等。中国驻越南民主共和国大使何伟、经济代表方毅也参加了大会。
