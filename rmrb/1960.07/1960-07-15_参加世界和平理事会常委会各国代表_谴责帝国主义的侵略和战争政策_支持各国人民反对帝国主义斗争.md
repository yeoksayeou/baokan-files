Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 14th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden from July 9th to 11th. More than one hundred representatives from over fifty countries and three international organizations participated in the meeting. The meeting exchanged opinions on the current international situation. Speakers enthusiastically exposed the United States imperialists' creation of new war dangers, condemned the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, expressed indignation at the crimes of the United States' aggression against Cuba and Belgium's aggression against the Congo, supported the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, supported the struggle of people of all countries to win and safeguard national independence and national sovereignty, and demanded the abolition of foreign military bases, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the realization of complete disarmament, and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

　　President of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, Bernal, gave a report at the meeting. Bernal said that it must be admitted that we are living in a great era of liberation in history. For the first time, the pressure of the masses is simultaneously very active all over the world. He pointed out that the existence of military bases is a threat to peace, and we must support and expand all activities against military bases and for disarmament.

　　Soviet representative, Ko Chuk, in his speech, condemned the dangerous provocations of the U.S. ruling clique against the cause of peace. He pointed out that it is now clear that the U.S. ruling clique caused the failure of the Four-Power Summit Conference, which is not an isolated incident, but part of its broader aggressive plan. He said that recently, the representatives of the United States and other Western countries participating in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting refused to discuss the Soviet Union's constructive proposals, nor did they put forward any proposals of their own, and did not take any steps to bring the positions of both sides closer.

　　Chinese representative Liao Chengzhi pointed out in his speech that in the recent period, the struggles of people of all countries against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace have achieved a series of new great victories. However, the U.S. imperialists' war policy, aggressive policy, and ambition to enslave the people of the world have not changed. The primary task of the current world peace movement is to make full use of the current excellent situation and encourage the people of the world to fight with confidence to continue to defeat the war policy and aggressive policy of imperialism headed by the United States, and to defend world peace to the end.

　　Liao Chengzhi emphasized that in order to concentrate forces to defeat the enemy of world peace, the people of all countries should form the broadest united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and strengthen mutual support in the common struggle.

　　Japanese representative Yasui Iku reported at the meeting on the massive struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He also pointed out in his speech that only through the united struggle of all peaceful forces against imperialism and colonialism can the road to complete disarmament and peaceful coexistence be opened. As long as imperialist aggression and colonial rule continue to exist, complete disarmament and peaceful coexistence cannot become a reality.

　　Cuban representative Corona condemned the U.S. aggression against Cuba, and pointed out that U.S. imperialism is doing the same not only to Cuba, but also to the entire Latin America, as well as Asia and Africa. He said that we doubt that the leaders of the U.S. government have a genuine desire to solve problems, and we believe that they are not interested in peace. He emphasized that the struggle of people of all countries to safeguard sovereignty is an important factor for peace. He said that despite the military and other conspiracies of the U.S. warmongering forces, the Cuban people are determined to defend their independence, the Cuban people have organized militias against the invaders, and have firm confidence.

　　Italian representative Luchatto said that for peace, we must respect the national independence and sovereignty of all countries. Eisenhower's statement on the spy plane incident, in which he reiterated his disrespect for international law, is very serious. Luchatto pointed out that the struggle for independence is the struggle for peace. He said that we have the right to demand peace, to demand an end to military aggression, and to demand recognition of the independence of countries such as Algeria.

　　British representative Chaffeil accused NATO member states of supporting Belgium's sending troops to the Congo. He believes that interference in the affairs of Asian and African people is one of the greatest threats to the world. He pointed out that the people of Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have already taken action. He also said that military bases seriously threaten Britain and other countries.

　　Norwegian representative Bonavie said that in order for the United Nations to become a true international organization, it is necessary to restore China's seat in the United Nations, as many countries have requested. He emphasized that if the United States says that it is because of China's "aggression" when it obstructs the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations, we should point out that the situation has been aggravated due to the U.S. occupation of Taiwan.

　　Kenya African National Union Vice Chairman Oginga strongly condemned Western colonialism, pointing out that this is a long-standing source of unrest and disruption of peace in Africa. He said that it is meaningless to talk about disarmament without talking about eliminating racial superiority and anti-colonialism.

　　Indian representative Sok stressed that peaceful forces should mainly rely on the masses of the people. He particularly pointed out that the active forces that are truly fighting for peace at present are all anti-imperialist. If imperialism is defeated, then the disarmament issue and other issues can be resolved.

　　Ceylon representative Mrs. Gunawardena condemned Yugoslavia for serving U.S. policy, and exposed Yugoslavia's conspiracy to hinder Ceylon's development of relations with socialist countries.

　　The meeting passed a general declaration on the international situation, a letter to the people of all countries, a proposal on carrying out a huge world movement for disarmament and consolidation of peace, a resolution on the situation in the Congo, several resolutions on Cuba, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, and Algeria, and a resolution on protesting the persecution of peace fighters, etc.

　　In addition, the representatives of Asian and African countries participating in the meeting unanimously adopted and issued a declaration supporting the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence. Representatives from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Czechoslovakia participating in the meeting adopted and issued a declaration on Germany.

　　参加世界和平理事会常委会各国代表
　　谴责帝国主义的侵略和战争政策
    支持各国人民反对帝国主义斗争
    新华社14日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会常务委员会7月9日至11日在瑞典斯德哥尔摩举行会议。参加会议的有来自五十多个国家和三个国际组织的一百多位代表。会上就当前国际局势交换了意见，发言者极为踊跃，纷纷揭露美帝国主义制造新战争危险，谴责以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，对美国侵略古巴和比利时侵略刚果的罪行表示愤慨，支持日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约的斗争，支持各国人民争取和维护民族独立和民族主权的斗争，要求撤销外国军事基地、撤退外国军队、实现全面裁军、停止核武器试验。
    世界和平理事会主席团执行主席贝尔纳在会上作了报告。贝尔纳说，必须承认，我们生活在历史上伟大的解放时期。群众的压力第一次在世界各地同时很活跃。他指出，军事基地的存在是对和平的威胁，我们必须支持和扩大反对军事基地和争取裁军的一切活动。
    苏联代表考?楚克在发言中谴责了美国统治集团对和平事业的危险挑衅。他指出，现在已经很清楚，美国统治集团造成了四国政府首脑会议的失败，这并不是一个孤立事件，而是它更广泛的侵略计划的一部分。他说，最近参加十国裁军委员会会议的美国和其他西方国家的代表拒绝讨论苏联的建设性建议，同时也未提出任何自己的建议，未采取任何步骤来使双方的立场接近起来。
  中国代表廖承志在发言中指出，最近一个时期来，世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争，取得了一系列新的伟大胜利。但是美帝国主义的战争政策、侵略政策和奴役全世界人民的野心是没有改变的。目前世界和平运动的首要任务，就是要充分利用当前的大好形势，鼓舞世界人民满怀信心地为继续击败以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策、为保卫世界和平而斗争到底。
    廖承志强调指出，为了集中力量击败世界和平的敌人，世界各国人民应该结成最广泛的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线，并且加强在共同斗争中的相互支持。
    日本代表安井郁在会上报告了日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的声势浩大的斗争情况。他在发言中还指出，只有通过一切和平力量反对帝国主义和殖民主义的团结一致的斗争，才能打开通向彻底裁军和和平共处的道路。只要帝国主义侵略和殖民统治继续存在，彻底裁军和和平共处，就不可能成为事实。
    古巴代表克罗纳谴责美国对古巴侵略，并且指出美帝国主义不仅对古巴这样，对整个拉丁美洲以及亚洲、非洲，也是一样。他说，我们怀疑美国政府的领导人有真正解决问题的愿望，我们认为他们对和平不感兴趣。他强调各国人民维护主权的斗争是和平的重要因素。他说，尽管美国好战势力进行军事的和其他的阴谋，古巴人民坚决保卫自己的独立，古巴人民组织了民兵反对侵略者，并且有坚定的信心。
    意大利代表卢查托说，要和平就要尊重一切国家的民族独立和主权。艾森豪威尔在关于间谍飞机事件的声明中重申不尊重国际法，这很严重。卢查托指出，争取独立的斗争就是争取和平的斗争。他说，我们有权利要求和平，要求结束军事侵略，要求承认阿尔及利亚等国家的独立。
    英国代表夏菲尔指责北大西洋集团成员国支持比利时派军队去刚果。他认为，对亚非人民的干涉是对世界的最大威胁之一。他指出，日本、南朝鲜、土耳其人民已经行动起来。他又说，军事基地严重威胁着英国和其他国家。
    挪威代表波纳维说，要使联合国成为真正的国际机构，就一定要恢复中国在联合国的席位，许多国家都这样要求。他强调，如果美国在阻挠恢复中国在联合国的席位时说什么这是因为中国“侵略”，我们就应该指出，由于美国侵占台湾，才使局势严重化。
    怯尼亚非洲民族联盟副主席奥金加强烈谴责西方殖民主义，指出这是在非洲长期引起不安和破坏和平的一个根源。他说，如不谈消除种族优越感，不谈反殖民主义，只空谈裁军，是毫无意义的。
  印度代表索克强调和平力量主要应当依靠人民群众。他特别指出，目前真正为和平而斗争的积极力量，都是反帝的。如果战胜帝国主义，那么裁军问题和其他问题都能够解决。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦达纳夫人谴责了南斯拉夫为美国政策服务，并揭露了南斯拉夫阻碍锡兰发展同社会主义国家的关系的阴谋。
    会上通过了关于国际局势的总宣言、告各国人民书、关于开展裁军和巩固和平的巨大的世界运动的建议、关于刚果局势的决议、关于古巴、日本、怯尼亚、南非、阿尔及利亚的几个决议、关于抗议迫害和平战士的决议等。
    此外，参加会议的亚、非国家代表在会议期间一致通过和发表了一项支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立斗争的宣言。参加会议的奥地利、比利时、丹麦、法国、荷兰、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表通过和发表了一个关于德国的宣言。
