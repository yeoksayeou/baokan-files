Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 24th: The Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 23rd, demanding that the government cease its large-scale persecution of government employees participating in the strike.

    The statement pointed out that the purpose of this large-scale persecution is to retaliate against government employees and ruin their families, and also to crack down on trade union rights and the trade union movement itself.

    The statement said: "The government's decision to revoke recognition of trade unions that participated in strikes in accordance with legal labor dispute laws is another manifestation of the government's threatening and retaliatory attitude."

    The statement pointed out that "in fact, a large number of employees have been dismissed, and thousands more are threatened with dismissal. At the same time, notices of suspension have been issued on a large scale. Charges such as insubordination and incitement are being arbitrarily imposed on people, and the authorities have repeatedly mentioned mysterious 'files' regarding employees' situations."

    The statement continued, "It is said that local and departmental authorities are coercing employees before allowing them to return to their jobs. Officials are insisting that employees make all sorts of confessions at their pleasure. As a result, many people are being tricked into signing confessions stating that they participated in the strike under duress, and so on. Obviously, such tactics are intended to further slander the employees' struggle and trade union activities, and to create pretexts for attacking trade union activists among the employees."

    The statement said that this is not the attitude the government should take in dealing with the post-strike situation and treating employees. The Communist Party of India solemnly calls on the government to abandon this malicious policy and course of action. The statement said, "Persecution must not be allowed. All pending cases must be dropped, and departmental disciplinary measures must be abandoned. Attacks on trade unions and trade union rights must not be allowed. The Maintenance of Essential Services Ordinance must be repealed. All prisoners must be released unconditionally."

    The statement said, "The Communist Party warmly calls on the people and people's organizations to protest against this dangerous policy of the government, and to form a strong public opinion in a nationwide movement through public gatherings, demonstrations, and other forms of mass activities." Condemning the Government for Persecuting Striking Employees. 20,000 People in Calcutta Hold Protest Rally. Attendees Denounce Treachery of PSP Leaders

    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: New Delhi dispatch, according to yesterday's "Freedom Daily" report, 20,000 central government employees held a grand public rally in Calcutta on July 21, "condemning [the government's] dismissal and suspension of nearly 11,000 employees in West Bengal."

    Opposition party members of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly spoke at the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the government immediately revoke the notices of dismissal and suspension of employees, cancel all actions taken against employees, release those arrested, and revoke the presidential decree banning strikes.

    The newspaper said, "When Praja Socialist Party leader Sunil Das stood up to address the employees, a wave of outrage was expressed at the meeting, and accusations against the PSP were very strong." The employees shouted: "We will not listen to the opinions of a treacherous political party."

    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: New Delhi dispatch: According to the Press Trust of India, Indian officials announced on the 22nd that the Indian government has decided to dismiss all striking employees who have been found "guilty" by the courts, and to impose disciplinary sanctions on those who "engage in sabotage, commit violence, intimidation, or unruly behavior."

    According to this news agency, all departments of the Indian government have been asked to implement this decision.

    It was announced that other strikers would be allowed to return to work, but they would not be paid wages for the strike period, and their participation in the strike would be written in "secret files."

    印共中央书记处发表声明
    要求政府停止迫害罢工雇员
    号召人民通过集会示威在全国展开抗议活动
    新华社新德里24日电　印度共产党中央书记处在23日发表声明，要求政府停止对参加罢工的政府雇员进行大规模迫害。
    声明指出，这种大规模迫害的目的在于对政府雇员进行报复和毁掉他们的家庭，并且也为了打击工会权利，打击工会运动本身。
    声明说：“政府决定撤销对按照合法的劳资纠纷法而参加罢工的工会的承认，这是政府采取威胁和报复态度的又一个表现。”
    声明指出，“事实上，大批雇员已经被解雇，另外数以千计的人也受到解雇的威胁，同时，已经大规模地发出停职的通知。不服从和煽动等罪名正在任意加在人们的头上，并且当局还反复提到关于雇员情况的神秘的‘档案’。”
    声明又说，“据说，地方当局和部门当局在准许雇员复职以前正在对他们进行胁迫。凭官员们的高兴，坚持要雇员作各式各样的口供。因此，许多人正在被诱骗在这样的口供上具结，说什么他们是在威胁之下参加罢工的，等等。显然，采取这样的策略是要进一步诽谤雇员的斗争和工会活动，为进攻雇员中的工会积极分子制造借口。”
    声明说，这不是政府应该采取的处理罢工后的局面和对待雇员的态度。印度共产党严正地呼吁政府放弃这种不怀善意的政策和行动方针。声明说，“决不许迫害。必须撤销一切未决的案件，放弃部门的惩处措施。不许进攻工会和工会的权利。必须取消维持重要部门法令。必须无条件释放一切犯人。”
    声明说，“共产党热烈呼吁人民和人民团体抗议政府的这种危险政策，并且通过公众集会、示威和其他形式的群众活动，在全国范围的运动中形成强有力的舆论。”谴责政府迫害罢工雇员加尔各答两万人举行抗议集会到会群众怒斥人民社会党头目的背信弃义行为
    新华社23日讯　新德里消息，据昨天的“自由报”报道，两万名中央政府雇员7月21日在加尔各答举行盛大的公众集会，“谴责（政府）把西孟加拉邦将近一万一千名雇员开除和停职的行为”。
    西孟加拉邦议会的反对党议员在大会上讲了话。大会通过决议，要求政府立即撤销把雇员开除和停职的通知，取消一切针对雇员采取的行动，释放被捕者和撤销禁止罢工的总统法令。
    报纸说，“当人民社会党领袖苏尼耳·达斯站起来向雇员讲话时，大会上表现了激愤的情绪，对于人民社会党的指责十分强烈”。雇员们高呼：“我们不听一个背信弃义的政党的意见”。
    据新华社23日讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度官方在22日宣布，印度政府决定解雇所有被法庭判决“有罪”的罢工雇员，并且对那些“进行怠工、采取暴行、恐吓或粗野行为”的人给予纪律制裁。
    据这家通讯社说，已经要求印度政府各个部门执行这个决定。
    据宣布，将许可其他的罢工者恢复工作，可是不会发给他们在罢工期间的工资，并且将在“秘密档案上”写上他们参加罢工的事。
