    Good Rice Grows in Barren Land
    Douxue Tan in Huangcai Commune is a remote mountain gully with very poor natural conditions, only getting a glimpse of sunlight around noon. There are more than 20 mu of barren land here, with historically very low yields. However, "Five-Good Member" Wen Taoxiu took a liking to this land. She thought: the Party constantly educates us to transform nature, can't we find a way to make it better here? With the help of the production team's Party branch, Wen Taoxiu and eight female commune members formed a shock group to transform the low-yield field, determined to turn this barren field into fertile land.
    Wen Taoxiu first studied the causes of low yield with all the members of the group. They first engaged in large-scale fertilizer accumulation, applying nearly 900 dan of high-quality base fertilizer per mu. In order to cure the "Fanqiu Field" (yellowing and withering of seedlings after transplanting), they also applied high-temperature fertilizers such as cow dung and fire soil. After transplanting, they were continuously attacked by cold waves, and they carried six dan of seedlings from twenty miles away to make up for the missing ones, breaking through the full seedling barrier. In mid-May, the seedlings turned yellow and did not grow, so they applied more than sixty dan of high-temperature fertilizer to promote the greening of the seedlings. When it came to heading and flowering, they suffered from insect pests, so they used yellow vines and other materials to make medicinal powder and liquid, spraying it four times, wiping out the pests cleanly. Now, the early rice they planted has many tillers, strong stalks, many ears, large ears, many grains, and full grains, and a good harvest is in sight.

    瘠薄地里长出了好水稻
    黄材公社的斗穴滩是一个偏僻的山沟，自然条件很不好，只有中午的时间才能见到一会阳光。这里有二十多亩瘠瘦地，历年来产量很低。可是，“五好社员”文桃秀却看上了这块土地。她想：党经常教育我们要改造自然，这里就不能想办法让它变好吗？在生产队党支部的帮助下，文桃秀和八名女社员成立了一个改造低产田的突击组，决心把这块瘦田变成肥田。
    文桃秀首先和全组社员共同研究低产的原因。她们首先大搞积肥，每亩地下了优质底肥近九百担。为了治服“翻秋田”（插秧后禾苗枯黄）还施下了牛粪、火土等高温肥料。插秧后，连续遭到了寒潮的侵袭，她们又从二十里地远的地方背来六担秧苗，作了补插，突破了全苗关。到了5月中旬，禾苗翻黄不长，她们又施了六十多担高温肥料，促使秧苗转青。抽穗扬花的时候，又遭了虫灾，她们用黄藤等制成了药粉和药液，喷洒了四次，把害虫消灭得干干净净。现在，她们种的早稻，分蘖多，秧秆壮，穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱，已经丰收在望了。
