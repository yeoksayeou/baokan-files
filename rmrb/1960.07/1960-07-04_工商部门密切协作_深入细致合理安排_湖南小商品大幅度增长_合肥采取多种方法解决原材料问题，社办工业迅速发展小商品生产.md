    Changsha, July 3rd (By Our Own Correspondent) -- The industrial and commercial departments of Hunan Province have strengthened cooperation and actively arranged the production of daily-use small commodities, small hardware, and sundries to meet the needs of the broad masses. From January to mid-June this year, the province's output of major small commodities increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year, and the variety of products increased by more than 200 kinds and over 10,000 designs compared with the fourth quarter of last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, the commercial departments of Changsha City, based on market needs, have assisted industrial departments in designing and providing more than 1,000 varieties, and have also supported handicraft industry and urban street industry, helping to solve difficulties such as funds, equipment, and raw materials, and promoting the rapid development of small commodity production. The industrial and commercial departments of Shaoyang City also regularly hold industrial and commercial collaboration symposiums to actively arrange the production of small commodities according to the needs of the masses.

    In arranging the production tasks of small hardware and small commodities, factories and enterprises in various regions, based on the principle of "self-reliance and local material acquisition," have vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization of raw materials, conservation and substitution, and expanded sources of raw materials. This year, according to statistics from handicraft enterprises throughout the province, more than 500 kinds of raw materials and materials for producing small commodities and small hardware products have been found by adopting the above methods, and more than 1,000 kinds of new products have been manufactured. Seventy-eight handicraft factories and street factories in Hengyang City do not require the state to supply raw materials. They rely entirely on self-reliance, extensively seeking sources of raw materials, and producing more than 650 kinds of new products. These factories use scraps from large factories to make slippers, bone buttons, horn combs, hairpins and other products, which are both cheap and beautiful, and are very popular among the masses.

    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to small commodity production, grasping it tightly and early. As early as April and May this year, various localities prominently focused on the production of summer commodities such as bamboo beds, bamboo mats, bamboo chairs, straw mats, straw hats, bamboo curtains, fans, mosquito incense, and leather sandals. The Yiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China took the lead in mobilizing some residents and specialized production departments to actively arrange the production of "Shuizhu cool mats." The city's output of Shuizhu cool mats increased nearly twice compared with last year.

    Hefei, July 3rd (By Our Own Correspondent) -- Hefei City is focusing on the raw material supply for the production of small commodities by small factories and urban people's commune industries, which has greatly developed the city's small commodity production, especially summer commodities. According to statistics as of June 20, the city has produced more than 7,200 kinds of daily-use industrial products and handicraft products, an increase of 43% compared with the same period last year, and has added more than 350 kinds of new products; the output has also increased greatly, especially the output of various summer commodities, which has increased by 50% to ten times respectively. Of the more than 7,000 kinds of small commodities produced in the city, 4,000 kinds are produced by community-run industries.

    Hefei City mainly adopts the following methods to solve the raw material problem for small commodity production:

    1. Vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization, organize small factories to directly link up with large factories, and community-run factories to directly link up with large factories, with large factories dividing and supplying side materials and waste materials to produce small commodities. For example, the cotton weaving factory of the Miaojie branch of the Xishi People's Commune used the leftover yarn from the bobbins of the Anhui No. 1 Textile Factory to weave cotton cloth, canvas, and mosquito net cloth. The machinery factories and hardware factories of the Dongshi, Xishi, and Beishi communes used waste steel plates and steel materials from mining machinery factories and motor factories to produce sickles, hoes, kitchen knives, etc.

    2. Commercial departments actively collect scattered waste products and chemical raw materials from the people to supply small factories and community-run factories to produce small commodities. As of June 20, the city has collected waste products for the production of small commodities, with pig iron alone amounting to 398 tons and various steel materials amounting to 800 tons.

    3. Organize small factories and community-run factories to produce raw materials themselves according to needs. For example, bakelite powder, carbon rods, and calcium carbonate, which used to rely on supplies from other places, can now be produced by the factories themselves, which can not only be self-sufficient, but also export some.

    4. The relevant departments of Hefei City also include the local materials needed for the production of small commodities in the planned distribution, and allocate them to small factories and community-run factories on a quarterly and monthly basis.

    工商部门密切协作　深入细致合理安排
    湖南小商品大幅度增长
    合肥采取多种方法解决原材料问题，社办工业迅速发展小商品生产
    本报长沙3日电　湖南省手工业部门和商业部门加强协作，积极安排日用小百货、小五金和小杂品的生产，以满足广大群众的需要。今年1月至6月中旬止，全省主要小商品产量比去年同期增长40％以上，产品品种比去年第四季度增加两百多种和一万多个花色式样。
    今年以来，长沙市商业部门根据市场需要，协助工业部门设计和提供了一千多种花色品种，并且扶助手工业和城市街道工业，帮助解决资金、设备、原材料等困难，促进了小商品生产的迅速发展。邵阳市工业和商业部门，还定期召开工商协作座谈会，根据群众的需要，积极安排小商品生产。
    在安排小五金、小百货生产任务中，各地工厂企业根据“自力更生、就地取材”的原则，大搞原材料综合利用、节约代用，广辟原材料来源。今年来，据全省手工业企业统计，由于采取以上办法，已找到五百多种生产小百货、小五金产品的原料和材料，新制产品达一千多种。衡阳市有七十八个手工业工厂和街道工厂，不要国家供应原材料，全靠自力更生，广找原材料门路，生产出新产品达六百五十多种。这些工厂利用大厂的边角废料做成拖鞋、骨扣、角梳、发夹等产品，既便宜又美观，很受群众欢迎。
    各级党委对小商品生产十分重视，抓得紧，抓得早。今年早在4、5月间，各地突出地抓住了竹床、竹席、竹椅、草席、草帽、竹帘、扇子、蚊烟、皮凉鞋等夏令商品生产。中共益阳市委提前发动部分居民和专业生产部门一道，积极安排生产“水竹凉席”，全市生产的水竹凉席产量，比去年增长近一倍。
    本报合肥3日电　合肥市大抓小工厂和城市人民公社工业小商品生产的原料供应工作，使全市小商品生产，特别是夏令商品获得了很大发展。截至6月20日的统计，全市已生产日用工业品、手工业品七千二百多种，比去年同期增长43％，并增加了三百五十多种新产品；产量也有很大的增长，特别是各种夏令商品的产量，分别增长了50％到十倍。全市生产的七千余种小商品，有四千种是社办工业生产的。
    合肥市主要采取以下办法解决小商品生产的原材料问题：
    一、大搞综合利用，组织小厂与大厂、社办工厂与大厂直接挂钩，由大厂分片供应边材余料生产小商品。如西市人民公社庙街分社的棉织厂利用安徽第一纺织厂的筒管余纱，织成了棉布、帆布和蚊帐布等产品。东市、西市、北市三个公社的机械厂、五金厂利用矿山机械厂、电机厂的废钢板边、钢材头等原料，生产了镰刀、锄头、菜刀等。
    二、商业部门积极收集民间分散的废品和化工原料等，供应小工厂和社办工厂生产小商品。到6月20日止，全市收集来生产小商品的废品仅生铁就有三百九十八吨，各种钢材八百吨。
    三、组织小工厂和社办工厂根据需要自己生产原料。如过去一向依靠外地供应的胶木粉、炭精棒、炭酸钙等，各厂自己生产后，不但可以自给，而且还可以外调一部分。
    四、合肥市有关部门还把小商品生产所需要的地方材料纳入计划分配，按季分月拨付给小工厂和社办工厂。
