    (Reported by this newspaper) Chongqing's factory and mine employee spare-time universities have cultivated the first group of high-quality university graduates. This is a major victory for the "two legs walking" policy in China's education cause.
    Chongqing's factory and mine employee spare-time universities are developing vigorously. Currently, there are 1,108 factory and mine employee spare-time universities in the city, with 11,880 enrolled students. By the end of June this year, the first 40 university students have graduated from two of the earlier established spare-time universities. These university students are all young workers. When they entered the factory, most of them were illiterate. When they entered spare-time university in the second half of 1958, their general educational level was equivalent to that of secondary vocational school graduates, with a few at the junior high school level. However, they only spent one year and nine months of spare time to complete the four-year undergraduate mechanical engineering program, reaching a level equivalent to that of graduates from regular universities in the same major. More than 95% of the students achieved excellent or good grades in the 16 subjects they studied. Because they combined theory with practice in their studies, they generally possess the genuine ability to solve practical problems. For example, the 26 graduates of the Third Spare-Time University spent only about ten days of their spare time to complete the required five graduation designs. These are all the latest technologies in China today. The breadth of knowledge applied in the design, the speed of design, and the economic practicality of the designed products all demonstrate that their knowledge is of a high standard. The student Liu Chuanzong and other students designed a Lovikov gear, which has a special tooth shape and high load-bearing capacity, requiring extremely strict technical standards and a relatively profound knowledge of mechanics for design. There are no complete reference materials available in China, but they successfully designed it in just eight days of spare time. Another major feature of these students in the design process is their ability to closely integrate with production needs and design complete sets of equipment. For example, when designing machine tools, they can not only design the various parts and components, but also design complete sets of tools. At the same time, they can not only design and draw, but also personally manufacture, assemble, and use them.
    These university students are not only of a high standard in technical professional knowledge, but also have a high political consciousness and are the backbone of production. Because they both work and study, their thinking has been further tempered. For example, seven of the twenty students from the Third Spare-Time University were admitted to the Party during their studies.
    The rapid growth of these ideologically red and technically proficient worker university students vividly proves that factories and mines, by relying on their own efforts and through spare-time universities, can train working-class intellectuals at high speed and high quality. This is because factory and mine-run schools have many superior conditions: First, because students are both students and workers, this allows for better implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and better implementation of the combination of education, production, and scientific research. Students both produce and study, making it easier to discover problems in production, vigorously engage in scientific research, and closely combine the theoretical knowledge they have learned with solving practical problems. On the one hand, this promotes production, and on the other hand, it is conducive to consolidating learning outcomes. During their year-long study period, they engaged in scientific research to address problems in production, achieving more than 2,200 innovation projects and solving 223 key production issues. This process of combining education, production, and scientific research not only improved the quality of learning, but also directly promoted production. At the same time, because the students mastered theoretical knowledge, they quickly applied it to improve operating techniques and production equipment, so they completed more than three years' worth of work in more than a year of study.
    Second, because factories and mines are production units and students are producers, factory and mine-run schools can better conduct teaching reforms according to the actual needs of factory production and workers. The content of the studies of these university graduates was based on the teaching plan of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Chongqing University, with some reforms made in terms of cutting, replacing, supplementing, and combining, reducing the seven courses that students had already solved in actual production, such as enterprise management, drawing, and labor; the sixteen courses that should be studied were also deleted or added according to the actual situation. For example, the course of mechanical manufacturing technology is generally taught for more than 200 hours in general universities, but these students are familiar with many processing methods and processes in this course from their daily production, so they only spent 28 hours to complete it. This arrangement not only ensures a high quality of learning, but also greatly reduces the learning time.
    Third, factory and mine-run universities also have extremely superior conditions for solving problems such as teachers and teaching equipment. The teachers who trained these university students, in addition to some full-time teachers, were mostly older workers and engineering technicians who were hired to give lectures, and some courses were taught and learned by the students themselves. Because veteran workers or engineering technicians have both considerable theoretical knowledge and rich production experience, their lectures are vivid and profound, which can make up for the shortcomings of professional teachers who lack practical production knowledge. Therefore, these students were able to fully and flexibly combine classroom lectures, on-site learning, and visits to experiments in their studies, so they progressed quickly.

    重庆厂矿业余大学高速度高质量地培养技术力量
    首批毕业生已成为生产中的骨干
    本报讯　重庆的厂矿职工业余大学，培养出了第一批高质量的大学毕业生。这是我国教育事业上“两条腿走路”方针的一个重大的胜利。
    重庆的厂矿职工业余大学正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展，目前全市已有了一千一百零八所厂矿职工业余大学，入学学员达一万一千八百八十人；到今年6月底，已有两所办得较早的业余大学四十名大学生毕业。这批大学生，都是青年工人，他们进厂时大部分是文盲。1958年下半年入业余大学时，一般的文化程度是中专毕业水平，还有少数是初中程度；但是，他们只用了一年零九个月的业余时间，就完成了大学本科机械专业四年的学习任务，达到了相当于一般正规大学同专业毕业生的水平。他们所学的十六门学科中，达到优良成绩的学员占学员总数的95％以上。由于他们在学习中理论与实践结合，因此，一般都具有解决实际问题的真本领。如第三业余大学的二十六名毕业生，仅仅以十天左右的业余时间就作出了规定的五项毕业设计。这些都是目前我国的最新技术，在设计中应用的知识范围之广，设计速度之快，以及设计出来的产品的经济实用之好，都证明了他们所学的知识是高标准的。学员刘传宗和其他学员一道设计出的洛维柯夫齿轮，齿型特殊，承受力大，技术上要求极为严格，必须要有比较高深的力学计算知识才能设计，目前国内又没有完整的参考资料，但他们只用了八天业余时间就设计成功了。这批学员在设计中还有一个最大的特点，就是能够紧密结合生产的需要，设计出整套的设备。如设计机床，不仅可以设计它的各个零件、部件，而且刀具也可以成套地设计出来。同时不仅能设计、绘图，而且还可以亲自制造、装配、使用。
    这批大学生不仅技术专业知识方面是高标准的，而且政治觉悟高，都是生产中的骨干力量。由于边劳动、边学习，又进一步锻炼了思想。如第三业余大学的二十名学员在学习期中就有七人被接受入党。
    这批思想红、技术专的工人大学生如此迅速成长，生动地证明了各个厂矿自力更生、通过业余大学的方法，是能够高速度、高质量地培养出工人阶级的知识分子来的。这是因为厂矿办学有许多优越的条件：首先，由于学员既是学生又是工人，这就能更好地贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，更好地实行教育、生产、科学研究三结合。学员边生产、边学习，易于发现生产中的问题，大搞科学研究，把学得的理论知识与解决实际问题紧密结合起来，一方面推动了生产，另方面也有利于巩固学习成果。他们在一年多的学习过程中，就针对生产中的问题大搞科学研究，实现了革新项目二千二百多项，解决了生产关键二百二十三个。这个教育、生产和科学研究相结合的过程，不仅提高了学习质量，而且直接推动了生产。同时，由于学员们掌握了理论知识，很快地运用来改进操作技术和生产设备，所以，在一年多学习期间就完成了三年多的工作量。
    其次，由于厂矿是生产的单位，学员又是生产者，因此，厂矿办学又能够根据工厂生产和工人的实际需要，更好地进行教学改革。这批大学毕业生学习的内容就是以重庆大学机械专业的教学计划为基础，作了一些砍、换、补、合的改革，减少了学员在实际生产中已经解决了的企业管理、制图、劳动等七门课程；设置的应该学习的十六门课程，也是根据实际情况作了删削或增添。例如，机械制造工艺学这门课程，一般大学要讲二百多个学时，但这些学员对这门课程中的许多加工方法、工艺过程等，每天在生产中就熟悉了的，因此，他们只用了二十八个学时就讲完了。这种安排，既保证了很高的学习质量，又大大减少了学习时间。
    第三，厂矿办大学，在解决教师、教学设备等问题方面也有着极为优越的条件。培养这批大学生的教师，除了部分专职教师外，更多的是聘请了有关的老工人和工程技术人员讲课，有的课程还由学员自己互教互学。由于老工人或工程技术人员既有相当的理论知识，更有丰富的生产经验，所以讲课生动、精深，正可弥补专业教师缺乏实际生产知识的缺陷。所以这批学员在学习中，能够充分地、灵活地把课堂听讲、现场学习和参观实验很好地结合起来，因此进步很快。
