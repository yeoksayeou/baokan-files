Reform Work Uniform Styles

The Lingsi Coal Mine in Shuangyashan, Heilongjiang Province, has saved 90,000 feet of cotton cloth in sixteen months by adopting reformed work uniform styles and vigorously utilizing waste materials. In the past, due to unsound management systems, the mine experienced many losses, damages, and wastes of work uniforms. Since assigning a dedicated person to be responsible for unified management and improving the method of distributing work uniforms, the average amount of cloth used for work uniforms per worker per year has been reduced from 21 feet to 13.4 feet. While strengthening management, the mine has also comprehensively reformed the style of work uniforms based on the needs of different types of work and the principles of safety, comfort, economy, and practicality. For example, mining and transportation workers each have a towel around their necks, so the work uniforms no longer have collars, which saves a lot of cloth. Changing the four pockets on the upper garment to one pocket, and changing the concealed buttons to exposed buttons, and changing the three pockets on the trousers to two patch pockets, saves another three and a half feet of cloth per set of work uniforms. The mine has also established a processing and mending workshop for labor protection supplies, and a dismantling, washing, and sewing team has been set up at the mine entrance. Since last year, they have repaired more than 4,000 sets of work uniforms, saving more than 46,000 feet of cotton cloth. Worn-out work uniforms that can no longer be worn are used to make elbow pads, knee pads, shoe covers, and gloves. (Xinhua)

    改革工作服样式
    黑龙江省双鸭山岭西煤矿采用改革工作服样式、大搞废物利用等办法，十六个月来共节约了九万尺棉布。这个矿过去因为管理制度不健全，工作服丢失、损坏、浪费的很多。自从有专人负责统一管理和改进了发放工作服的方法以后，平均每个工人每年工作服用布由二十一尺减少到十三点四尺。在加强管理的同时，这个矿又根据不同工种的需要和安全、适体、经济实用的原则，全面改革了工作服样式。譬如采掘、运输工人每个人都有毛巾围在脖子上，工作服便取消了上衣领子，可节省不少布；把上衣四个兜改为一个兜，暗扣改为明扣，裤子上的三个兜改为两个贴兜，每套工作服又节约三尺半布。矿内还设立了劳动保护用品加工缝补车间，井口设立了拆洗缝纫小组，从去年到现在共修补了四千多套工作服，节约棉布四万六千多尺。不能再穿的破工作服则用来做护肘、护膝和鞋盖、手套等。　（新化）
