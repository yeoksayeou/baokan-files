Xinhua News Agency, July 1st—The Third Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, held on June 24th, concluded on the 30th. The Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was also held simultaneously.

    Comrade Peng Zhen delivered an important speech to the delegates and members. Comrade Peng Zhen said that Beijing has achieved great success in all aspects of its work, including industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, and health. However, these achievements are still far from our goals, and we must continue to make great efforts. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: Our current task is, first, to grasp agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation, and industry and all other departments must support agriculture. Second, we must grasp industry. In industry, we must now use great efforts to grasp the production of raw materials, and while increasing production, we must pay special attention to increasing varieties and improving quality. Third, we must go all out, aim high, and strive to comprehensively and overfulfill all indicators. All factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, and other units must be down-to-earth, work diligently, and cooperate with each other. Fourth, we must pay attention to combining work and rest. Leaders of factories, enterprises, communes, agencies, and schools should improve their working methods and organize production and work well to ensure good production, good work, good study, and good health. Finally, he pointed out that while grasping production, work, and study, we must pay attention to arranging the lives of the masses. With the gradual collectivization of life, managing the lives of the masses is an important task placed before every unit and every leading cadre. Various collective welfare undertakings such as canteens and nurseries should be run well as major socialist undertakings. In terms of life, we must implement the principle of "large collective, small freedom."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the meeting and made a report on the current situation.

    In their speeches, the delegates and members unanimously condemned and denounced the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. They expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan. At the same time, they firmly supported the just struggles of the Japanese people, the Korean people, and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    Beijing Vice Mayor Wan Li delivered a report at the meeting on "The 1960 National Economic Plan, the 1959 Final Accounts of Revenue and Expenditure, and the 1960 Budget of Revenue and Expenditure." The report said that since entering the great 1960s, the people of Beijing have shown even more heroism and speed. From the beginning of this year, an unprecedentedly good situation has emerged, and the upsurge in production has continued to develop wave after wave.

    Wan Li gave a detailed report on the development of industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, urban construction, culture, education, health, scientific research, and urban people's communes in Beijing in the past year, and put forward the direction of future efforts. The report pointed out that the excellent situation in industry and transportation has been pushed to a new stage by the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. The current task is to achieve a comprehensive great leap forward with high output, high quality, high efficiency, multiple varieties, low consumption, and more, faster, better, and more economical results. We must grasp the two main links of continuing to vigorously carry out the technical revolution and vigorously improving enterprise management. The technical revolution should take appraisal and promotion as the key, vigorously consolidate and improve, and concentrate efforts to solve the weak links and key problems in production. Enterprise management must mobilize and rely on the masses, carry out major destruction and major construction based on the new situation, and while increasing output, we must pay attention to improving quality, and promote both high output and high quality simultaneously.

    The report pointed out that this year's suburban agriculture should comprehensively arrange various productions such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as commune industry and basic construction projects such as water conservancy, under the principle of taking grain as the key, ensuring self-sufficiency in vegetables, and vigorously developing animal husbandry with pig raising as the center. Each production team must conscientiously summarize and promote the practical experience of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and formulate specific plans and specific measures for increasing grain production for each piece of land. In the first half of this year, the weather was dry, and the suburban farmers carried out a tenacious struggle against drought and achieved success. In the future, we must fully mobilize the masses to fight drought and rush planting, and pay attention to preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests and draining water during the rainy season, and strive to increase the production of grain crops this year. We must seize vegetable production and ensure the completion of vegetable production targets. Animal husbandry production should take pigs as the head and actively develop the breeding of livestock and poultry such as cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, deer, and rabbits, and pay attention to developing beekeeping and sericulture. Each commune should take agricultural production as the center, make overall arrangements for various productions, and especially arrange the use of labor reasonably.

    The report emphasized that actively promoting the technical transformation of agriculture and moving agriculture towards modernization is an important task at present. The districts, counties, and people's communes in the suburbs must rely on their own efforts, mobilize the masses, and work diligently, arduously, and ingeniously, adopt the methods of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," and vigorously run commune industries. We will produce our own raw materials, refine steel and iron, and produce our own machinery to arm ourselves. At the same time, industry, finance and trade, culture, education, and health should vigorously support agriculture, help agriculture implement technical transformation, and promote the development of agricultural production.

    When talking about urban construction, the report pointed out that urban construction must be unified in planning and comprehensive in arrangement. The layout must not only meet the needs of the development of various undertakings at present but also must focus on the long term and be as conducive as possible to the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and be conducive to gradually eliminating the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor. In the process of urban construction, we must also pay attention to the proportional development of construction in various aspects such as housing, production, work, and education.

    The report said that cultural and educational work should continue to implement the Party's general line, carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front to the end, thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, and further enhance the communist consciousness and moral character of the people.

    The report pointed out that urban people's communes are undergoing rectification and consolidation after their great development. This is: First, strengthen the Party's leadership over the communes, enrich the commune cadres, rectify the grassroots organizations, improve the leadership style, carry out socialist and communist ideological education, and further enhance the political consciousness of cadres and members. Second, strengthen the management of commune-run industries. Each district is implementing unified leadership, unified arrangement of production, raw materials, product sales, etc., to improve the level of management and technical level, and establish and improve the necessary production technology management, finance, labor, and wage system. In the wage system, we should adhere to the principle of time-based payment as the main method, piece-rate payment as the auxiliary method, and gradually increasing collective welfare undertakings. At present, because the production technology of commune industries is still relatively backward, the net income is relatively low, and the foundation is still very weak, the wage level should be lower than that of state-owned enterprises of the same type, in order to increase accumulation, expand reproduction, carry out technical transformation, and run collective welfare undertakings. Third, strengthen the leadership of collective life welfare undertakings, carry out rectification, consolidation, and development. In particular, nurseries and canteens should be vigorously rectified and developed, and the political, professional, and technical level of nursery and canteen staff should be improved, so that these collective life welfare undertakings will be run better and better and more and more.

    The report finally talked about the issue of combining work and rest.

    The delegates and members enthusiastically discussed Wan Li's report. At the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the delegates unanimously approved the report and called on the people of the city to continue to hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes under the leadership of the Party, and strive to complete and overfulfill the Beijing Municipal National Economic Plan for 1960 and realize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960.

    The Municipal People's Congress also elected Wang Chun and Zhao Pengfei as Vice Mayors of Beijing.

    陈毅副总理到会作了关于目前形势的报告。
    代表们和委员们在发言中，一致愤怒谴责、声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。他们表示一定要解放台湾。同时坚决支持日本人民、朝鲜人民以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    北京市副市长万里代表市人民委员会在会上作了“关于1960年国民经济计划、1959年财政收支决算和1960年财政收支预算”的报告。报告说，北京市人民踏进伟大的六十年代以来，更加表现得豪迈而迅速。今年一开始就出现了空前大好的局面，生产高潮一浪接一浪地持续不断地向前发展。
    万里对北京市过去一年的工业、农业、商业、交通运输、城市建设、文教卫生、科学研究和城市人民公社的发展等方面，都做了详细的报告，并提出了今后的努力方向。报告指出，工业交通运输方面的大好形势已由技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个新阶段。当前的任务是要实现高产量、高质量、高效率、多品种、低消耗，多快好省的全面大跃进。必须抓住继续大搞技术革命和大力改进企业管理两个主要环节。技术革命要以鉴定、推广为纲，大力巩固、提高，集中力量解决生产上的薄弱环节和关键问题。企业管理要发动和依靠群众，根据新的情况进行大破大立，在产量提高的同时，必须注意提高质量，高产优质同时并举。
    报告指出，今年郊区农业，要在以粮为纲、保证蔬菜自给、以及大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业的方针下，全面安排农、林、牧、副、渔等各项生产和公社工业以及水利等基本建设事业。各个生产队都要认真地总结和推广农业“八字宪法”的实际经验，按每块土地定出增产粮食的具体计划和具体措施。今年前半年天气干旱，郊区农民进行了顽强的抗旱斗争，取得了成绩。今后还必须充分发动群众抗旱抢种，并且注意防治病虫害和雨季的排涝，力争今年粮食作物的增产。要抓紧蔬菜生产，保证完成蔬菜生产指标。畜牧生产要以猪为首，积极发展牛、羊、驴、骡、马、鸡、鸭、鹅、鹿、兔等家畜家禽的饲养，并注意发展养蜂、养蚕事业。各公社要以农业生产为中心，统筹安排各项生产，特别要合理地安排使用劳动力。
    报告强调指出，积极推行农业的技术改造，使农业向现代化的方向迈进，是当前的重要任务，郊区各区、县、人民公社必须自力更生，发动群众、穷干、苦干、巧干，采用小土群、小洋群的方法，大办公社工业。自己生产原料，炼钢、炼铁，自己生产机械武装自己。同时，工业、财贸、文教、卫生等方面，都要大力支援农业，帮助农业实行技术改造，促进农业生产的发展。
    报告在谈到城市建设时指出，城市建设必须统一规划，全面安排。布局既要适应目前各方面事业发展的需要，又必须从长远着眼，尽可能有利于工、农、商、学、兵的结合，有利于逐步消灭工农差别、城乡差别和脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。在城市建设过程中，还必须注意居住、生产、工作、教育等各方面的建设按比例的发展。
    报告说，文教工作要继续贯彻执行党的总路线，把政治思想战线的社会主义革命进行到底，彻底肃清资产阶级的思想，更加提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和道德品质。
    报告指出城市人民公社在大发展之后，正在进行整顿和巩固工作。这就是：第一、加强党对公社的领导，充实公社干部，整顿基层组织，改进领导作风，进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，进一步提高干部和社员的政治觉悟。第二、加强对社办工业的管理，各区对公社工业正在实行统一领导，统一安排生产、原料、产品销售等，提高管理水平和技术水平，建立和健全必要的生产技术管理、财务、劳动工资制度。在工资制度上要以计时为主，计件为辅和逐步增加集体福利事业的原则。目前因为公社工业的生产技术还比较落后，纯收入较低，而底子又还很薄，工资水平应低于国营同类企业的工资，以便增加积累，扩大再生产，进行技术改造和举办集体福利事业。第三、加强集体生活福利事业的领导，进行整顿、巩固和发展。特别是托儿所和食堂，应该大力整顿和发展，提高托儿所和食堂工作人员的政治、业务和技术水平，使这些集体生活福利事业，愈办愈好，愈办愈多。
    报告最后谈到了劳逸结合的问题。
    代表们和委员们热烈地讨论了万里的报告，在北京市人民大表大会上，代表们一致通过了这个报告，号召全市人民在党的领导下，继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，为完成、超额完成北京市1960年国民经济计划和实现1960年的继续大跃进而奋斗。
