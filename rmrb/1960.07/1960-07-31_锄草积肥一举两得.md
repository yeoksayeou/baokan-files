    Weeding and Fertilizing in One Stroke
    In July, continuous rain caused weeds to grow profusely in the fields. Our commune organized 15,000 people to launch a production campaign of "weeding, collecting weeds, digging pits, and composting green manure simultaneously." The commune members proposed: "Don't let an acre go uncultivated out of ten thousand acres, don't let a seedling be missing out of a thousand acres, weeding and eliminating wasteland while accumulating fertilizer, a one-stone-two-birds method is good!" The tasks of weeding and eliminating wasteland and composting green manure were carried out by two separate forces, one responsible for weeding, and the other for collecting the weeds and digging pits on the spot to compost green manure. This method greatly saved labor in accumulating and transporting fertilizer.
    As of July 19, the entire commune had weeded the 90,000 mu of cotton fields once or twice, and composted approximately 200,000 cartloads of green manure, providing sufficient fertilizer for the autumn sowing.

    锄草积肥一举两得
    七月里阴雨连绵，田里的杂草丛生，我们公社组织了一万五千多人展开了“边锄草、边拾草、边挖坑、边沤积绿肥”的生产活动。社员提出：“万亩不荒一亩地，千亩不缺一棵苗，锄草灭荒又积肥，一举两得办法好！”锄草灭荒和沤积绿肥分两路大军进行，一路专管锄草，一路将锄下的草拾净，就地挖坑沤绿肥。这办法大大节省了积肥和运肥的劳动力。
    全公社到七月十九日止，九万亩棉田已锄一至二遍，沤积绿肥约有二十万车，给秋播备下了充足肥料。
