Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: Two million Japanese people held demonstrations and rallies in fifty locations across the country today, declaring that they do not recognize the new "Security Treaty," demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and opposing the illegal suppression of the anti-American patriotic movement by the Nobusuke Kishi government.

This marks the climax of the twentieth national unified action, launched from June 25th to July 2nd, following Nobusuke Kishi's announcement of his "determination to resign," and represents a pursuit of victory.

In Tokyo, a central rally was held in the afternoon, attended by 100,000 workers, students, citizens, and representatives from various regions. The rally adopted a declaration stating that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is completely invalid. A strong movement should be further launched to abolish this treaty.

The declaration guaranteed that all participants in the rally would strive to encourage the entire Japanese people to rise up and take action to promote policies of peace and democracy. "We will also strive to strengthen cooperation with peace-loving people of all countries."

After the declaration was adopted, the Secretariat of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" suggested removing reactionary politicians such as Nobusuke Kishi from political circles because they actively worked to "ratify" the new "Security Treaty." At this point, thunderous applause erupted from the venue.

Kozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Secretariat, emphasized at the rally that this gathering marks the beginning of a new struggle to dissolve the Diet and form a government that does not recognize the new "Security Treaty." He said that all those who participated in the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" should become the core of this new struggle.

Minakuchi continued, saying that the Japanese people have achieved a glorious victory, preventing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, forcing Nobusuke Kishi to announce his "determination to resign," and effectively rendering the new "Security Treaty" ineffective.

Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized at the meeting that the eighteen-month struggle against the "Security Treaty" has made it clear to everyone that the masters of this country are the Japanese people, and they have taken the fate of Japan into their own hands. Nosaka emphasized that if the struggle continues and the people unite more closely than ever before, the Japanese people will definitely be able to prevent the implementation of the new "Security Treaty" and ultimately abolish it.

Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, advocated forming a new government through general elections in order to finally shatter the new "Security Treaty."

The rally then passed a resolution expressing the participants' determination to take strong action against any government that inherits the policies of Nobusuke Kishi. The resolution called for the immediate dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections.

Another resolution adopted at the rally stated that the Japanese people cannot tolerate the Nobusuke Kishi government's repressive measures against the masses participating in the movement against the new "Security Treaty" and the workers participating in the general strike. The resolution said: "If the government takes repressive measures against workers and the people, we will resolutely rise up and repel it."

After the rally, a large parade of 100,000 people marched past the Diet, the Prime Minister's residence, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, heading towards the downtown area of Tokyo, shouting slogans against the suppression of workers. The marching crowds also broadcast loud calls from truck loudspeakers: "We reject the 'Security Treaty'!"

In the evening, another rally of 50,000 people was held in Tokyo, mainly attended by workers after work. Among them, 15,000 workers from Kanagawa Prefecture held a gathering in front of the Imperial Palace Square before participating in this rally. The Imperial Palace Square had not been used for public gatherings since the "May Day" demonstration in 1952.

Tokumi Kikitani, a representative of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized at the rally that the spearhead of the struggle should be correctly directed at the real enemies—the American imperialists and Japan's traitorous reactionaries.

The roar of declaring non-recognition of the new "Security Treaty" resounded throughout the four islands of Japan today.

In Osaka, 46,000 people from all walks of life held four rallies in succession from afternoon to evening, declaring non-recognition of the new "Security Treaty" and opposing the Nobusuke Kishi government's suppression of striking workers participating in the patriotic movement. After the rally, participants held a demonstration in the city.

In Kyoto, the ancient cultural capital of Japan, more than 8,000 people held rallies and parades in the afternoon and evening. 20,000 miners and family members from the Miike Coal Mine, who have been on strike, held a massive rally in Omuta City today, participating in today's unified action.

    展开强有力的运动争取废除日美条约　坚决反对继承岸信介政策的任何政府
    日本二百万人继续反美反岸大示威
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本两百万人民今天在全国五十个地方举行示威和大会，宣布不承认新“安全条约”，要求立即解散国会和反对岸信介政府非法镇压反美爱国运动。
    这是日本人民迫使岸信介宣布“决心辞职”之后，从6月25日到7月2日展开的第二十次全国统一行动在高潮中结束，也是一次乘胜追击。
    东京在下午举行了有十万工人、学生、市民和来自各地代表参加的中央大会。会上通过宣言宣布：新日美“安全条约”是完全无效的。应该进一步展开强有力的运动争取废除这个条约。
    宣言保证，所有参加大会的人将努力使全体日本人民奋起采取行动而促使举行和平与民主的政策。“我们也将努力加强同世界各国爱好和平的人民的合作”。
    在宣言通过后，阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议干事会建议把岸信介等反动政客清除出政界，因为他们积极活动“批准”新“安全条约”。这时，会场上响起了雷动般的掌声。
    国民会议事务局长水口宏三在大会上强调指出，这个大会标志着争取解散国会、组成不承认新“安全条约”的政府的新斗争的开始。他说，所有参加过阻止批准新“安全条约”斗争的人们，应当成为这个新的斗争的核心。
    水口继续说，日本人民已经取得了光辉的胜利，他们阻止了艾森豪威尔访日，迫使岸信介宣布“决心辞职”，并且要在实际上使新“安全条约”失去效力。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三在会上强调说，十八个月来反对“安全条约”的斗争已经使任何人都看清楚，这个国家的主人是日本人民，他们已经把日本的命运掌握在自己手中。野坂强调说，如果继续进行斗争，人民团结得比以前任何时候更加紧密，日本人民一定能够阻止新“安全条约”的实施，并且最后废除它。
    日本社会党书记长江田三郎主张通过大选来成立新政府，以便最后粉碎新“安全条约”。
    大会接着通过决议，表示与会者决心采取强有力的行动，来反对继承岸信介政策的任何政府。决议要求立即解散国会和举行大选。
    大会通过的另一项决议说，日本人民不能容忍岸信介政府对参加反对新“安全条约”运动的群众和参加总罢工的工人采取镇压措施。决议说：“如果政府对工人和人民采取镇压措施，我们将毅然决然地奋起击退它”。
    会后举行了十万人大游行，他们路过国会、首相官邸和东京警视厅，涌向东京闹市，高呼反对镇压工人的口号。游行群众还从卡车的扩音器上发出响亮的呼声：“我们拒绝‘安全条约’！”
    傍晚，东京又举行了五万人的大会，参加大会的人主要是下班后的工人。其中一万五千名来自神奈川的工人，在参加这次大会之前先在皇宫前广场举行了集会。皇宫前广场自从1952年“五一”示威以后一直没有用来举行过公众集会。
    日本共产党代表听涛克己在大会上强调说，应该正确地使斗争的锋芒针对真正的敌人——美帝国主义者和日本的卖国反动派。
    宣布不承认新“安全条约”的吼声，今天响彻了日本四岛。
    大阪的四万六千名各界人士从下午到晚上相继举行四次大会，宣布不承认新“安全条约”和反对岸信介政府镇压参加爱国运动的罢工工人。参加大会的人会后在市区内举行了示威。
    在日本的文化古都京都，八千多人分别在下午和晚上举行大会和游行。一直坚持罢工的三池煤矿工人和家属二万人，今天在大牟田市举行了声势浩大的集会，参加了今天的统一行动。
