    Seven Days and Nights of Wind and Rain
    Record of the Glorious Deeds of Cadres at All Levels in the Shantou Region in the Struggle Against Flooding and Rescue Efforts
    Written Collectively by Our Newspaper's Guangdong-Based Reporters and Correspondents
    In early June, a powerful typhoon of force 12, originating in the South China Sea, swept across the Shantou region in eastern Guangdong Province. In the wake of the typhoon, torrential rains poured down, mountain torrents roared, and sea waves surged. Amid the typhoon and torrential rain, cadres at all levels in the Shantou region, who had gone deep into the front lines of production, stood fearlessly at the forefront of disaster relief, leading millions of people across the region in a fierce seven-day-and-night battle against the disaster, ultimately turning danger into safety and overcoming the force 12 typhoon and the largest recorded flood peak in the Han River.
    During those unforgettable seven days and nights, how many inspiring and moving deeds were generated on the most dangerous sea dikes, mountain ponds, and reservoirs!

    On the Coastline
    A perilous struggle was underway on the sea dike of Fengjiang Commune in Raoping County, at the eastern end of the coastline.
    Zhang Dazhu, Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of Xiazhong Brigade in Fengjiang Commune, had been constantly worried about the weakest section of the dike at Yudong Creek. However, the violent wind, which uprooted trees and blew off tiles, made it difficult even to walk. How could they bring tools to the sea dike for rescue work? After consulting with the commune members for a long time, they came up with a plan: each person would tie three burlap sacks to their body, and every three people would carry a shovel, to increase their weight and charge up the dike. The commune members crawled and stumbled on the dike, barely managing to reach a point dozens of meters away from the dangerous section of Yudong Creek when the storm knocked them down. Seeing this situation, Zhang Dazhu immediately stood up and shouted loudly: "Don't be afraid! We will definitely protect the sea dike. All Communist Party members, come here!" Zhang Ke, Zhang Yiyou, Zhang Bian, Zhang Yourong, Zhang Yixi, Zhang Yuhu, and six other Communist Party members, guided by the shout, felt their way to Zhang Dazhu's side. The seven people huddled together, hands clasped tightly, heads touching, to prevent the storm from scattering their voices. On the windy and rainy dike, a temporary emergency Party member meeting began. Zhang Dazhu said calmly and forcefully: "Comrades, we Communist Party members must have the firm revolutionary will of the proletariat, the spirit of self-sacrifice of the 'Eight Heroines Throwing Themselves into the River'. At this critical moment, we must fearlessly devote ourselves to the interests of the masses, take the lead in charging forward, protect the dike, and protect the people's lives and property." The few minutes of the Party member meeting unified the will of the Party members. Zhang Dazhu's words tightly linked the hearts of the seven Party members. Everyone stood up and took the lead in charging towards the dangerous section. The commune members squatting under the dike were moved by the fearless and resolute spirit of the Party members. One by one, they also followed. The wide sea dike had been eroded by the wind and waves to just over a foot wide, and two small breaches had already appeared. Zhang Dazhu immediately directed the commune members to block the two breaches.

    The Struggle at the Reservoirs
    The powerful typhoon brought with it boundless torrential rain, intense and concentrated. In every county of the Shantou region, the rainfall reached six or seven hundred millimeters in one or two days, and at least three hundred millimeters in others. At the peak of the rainfall, it reached thirty-three millimeters per hour. Such violent and rapid rain caused mountain torrents to pour down everywhere in an instant, with muddy currents covering the land. The water levels of all the mountain ponds and reservoirs, large and small, in the region rose rapidly at a rate of twenty to thirty centimeters per hour, and some quickly filled to capacity and overflowed.
    It was imperative to ensure the safety of the mountain ponds and reservoirs! The Party secretaries of various counties and communes braved the wind and rain, wading through water and climbing mountains, rushing to the front lines of flood control at the mountain ponds and reservoirs. A difficult battle to protect the Jieyang Reservoir unfolded.

    Starting on the 7th, fierce storms raged for two days and two nights, and the rainfall within the Jieyang Reservoir area surged to seven hundred and thirty millimeters. The roaring and surging mountain torrents pounded the dam in turn like galloping horses. Under the immense pressure, first, the concrete of the two pressure water pipes of the lower main dam was destroyed, and then, the soil around the base of the dam was eroded away in large chunks, and water also gushed out from the dam surface, creating a dangerous situation.
    Yuan Zhenshan and Liu Lizhi, secretaries of the Jieyang County Party Committee, rushed to the scene overnight to organize the rescue. Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee, and Yu Xiqu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Prefectural Party Committee, also rushed over overnight, directing the rescue without sleep.
    People jumped into the fast-flowing water at the dangerous spots, filling sandbags and throwing stones from day to night, and from night to dawn. However, they could not withstand the increasingly fierce mountain torrents, and the dam surface and foundation continued to peel away. What was even more serious was that the burlap sacks were gone, and other rescue equipment was almost used up; the bridge connecting the dam to the headquarters was also washed away by the flood, not only preventing equipment from being supplied, but also preventing the workers from rotating off duty.
    At this critical moment, County Party Secretary Yuan Zhenshan and Liu Lizhi, after discussing with the cadres, decided, "We will not leave the dam until the last moment!" They telephoned for assistance from higher authorities, and at the same time, they urgently built a waterproof embankment around the water-gushing dam surface to reduce the impact of the wind and waves on the dam surface, buying time while waiting for rescue.
    Yuan Zhenshan did not sleep or eat all night, and his stomach problems flared up, but he still carried sandbags and built waterproof embankments with the cadres in the strong wind and heavy rain. Liu Lizhi jumped into the water, carrying bundles of grass back and forth to block the flood. However, the floodwater rose faster than they could build the embankment, and a breach appeared in the waterproof embankment. They persevered to the end, still fearlessly piling grass bundles, filling sandbags, and throwing stones…

    It seemed that the dam could not be saved.
    Just at this critical moment, a reinforcement of four hundred soldiers from the People's Liberation Army arrived. After a day and night of rescue work, the next morning, planes dispatched by the Provincial Party Committee dropped a large amount of rescue equipment around the reservoir, and batches of supporting workers also arrived in a steady stream. The Jieyang Reservoir thus survived the highest flood level.

    Convergence on Both Banks of the Han River
    The typhoon gradually weakened, and the torrential rain also subsided, and the mountain ponds and reservoirs turned from danger to safety one by one. However, the floodwaters in the rivers rose with a vengeance. The water coming from countless small rivers, coupled with the backing of the tide, made the belly of the Han River, the largest river in the region, both full and swollen. On the 9th, the water level at Xiangzi Bridge in Chao'an suddenly exceeded the warning line, and it continued to rise, rise…

    At this time, Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee, who was personally directing the rescue of the reservoir in Jieyang County, immediately rushed to the Han River to direct the battle to protect the Han River dike. The Han River dike, which protects the lives and property of millions of people on the vast Chaoshan Plain, must be firmly defended! The highway was flooded, and cars could not drive. Luo Tian, feeling extremely anxious, immediately rolled up his trouser legs and walked on foot in the dark. His legs, which had rheumatism, became sore and painful from being soaked in water, but he gritted his teeth and continued to walk step by step towards Chao'an County. Upon arriving in Chao'an, he and Tian Rongshen, First Secretary of the Chao'an County Party Committee, studied the deployment for dike protection and immediately rushed back to Shantou. At noon, Qu Mengjue, Wen Minsheng, Zhang Gensheng, Secretary-General of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Liu Zhaolun, Director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, and others arrived in Shantou by plane to inspect and direct flood control and rescue. After listening to Luo Tian's report, they immediately came to the Han River dike together. At this time, a flood control team of 300,000 people had gathered on both banks of the Han River. The heads of the Party committees at all levels in the counties and cities along the river, such as Chao'an, Chenghai, and Shantou, were all directing on the dike. Cadres at six levels—province, prefecture, county, commune, brigade, and team—were all converging on the dike. They were all here to lead by example, enduring hardship first, and leading the masses in fighting the flood peak.

    The Han River experienced an unprecedentedly large flood peak in history. The water level at Xiangzi Bridge reached 16.88 meters, one millimeter higher than the highest level in history. An even more intense battle began.

    On the dike on the east bank of the Han River, more than ten meters of the outer slope of the dike in the Shang'ou section suddenly collapsed due to the flood, and the dike body was instantly cut in half, with only a half-meter-wide "keel" exposed above the water. The flood rushed fiercely into the dike.

    "The dike is collapsing! Come quick!" A series of alarm calls came from nearby. Xu Liyan, Secretary of the Party General Branch of Zhangji Brigade in Longdu Commune, Chenghai County, led a "shock team" composed of dozens of Party members, Youth League members, and activists, rushing up quickly. Xu Liyan was the first to plunge into the water, holding a sandbag weighing about 200 pounds, and fill it on the "keel," but the flood immediately washed the sandbag away. Then, dozens of "shock team" members also went into the water holding sandbags, desperately filling the "keel." Xu Liyan disregarded everything, leaped up violently, and pressed his body hard on the sandbag, no longer letting the flood wash it away. Under his leadership, the team members followed suit, and a layer of sandbags and a layer of people instantly appeared on the "keel," and the flood's ferocity was slightly suppressed. Xu Liyan shouted loudly: "Fill sandbags, quickly!" Immediately, sandbags were thrown down one after another, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" The "shock team" members heroically and cleverly dodged a sandbag and pressed down on another, finally raising the "keel" rapidly, and the flood was completely blocked outside the dike.

    After four days and nights of intense efforts, the main dikes of the Han River, which had been breached almost every year before liberation, remained unscathed in the face of the largest flood peak in history this time. The entire line of dikes was generally raised by one to two meters, becoming even taller and stronger.

    Risking Life and Death to Rescue Relatives
    The main sea dikes, reservoirs, mountain ponds, and river dikes were protected. However, under the combined attack of wind, rain, tide, and flood, in some places, some villages were inevitably flooded, and a large number of houses in some villages were blown down by the storm. The lives and property of the people were seriously threatened. However, the cadres in these places disregarded their own safety, risked their lives, and rescued the lives of the masses, enabling the broad masses of people to escape from danger.

    At dawn on the 9th, a force 12 typhoon struck Haifeng County along the coast. The wind was so strong that even old trees that were more than 200 years old were uprooted. In just 18 hours, it blew down or damaged 435 out of 444 houses in Shitang Village, Lianchuan Brigade, Lian'an Commune. All 32 cadres in the village, led by Deputy Brigade Leader and Communist Party member Hong Tiansi, ran back and forth in the dangerous situation of the storm sweeping wildly and tiles flying around, rescuing the masses.

    In this battle to rescue the masses, although more than ten of the thirty-plus cadres were injured, not a single one of the 689 people in the village, young and old, was injured; none of the 37 head of cattle, more than 80 pigs, and more than 480 ducks in the village suffered any losses.

    In this disaster relief struggle, Huang Chan, Secretary of the Party General Branch of Yuanshan Brigade, Hongyang Commune, Puning County (female), who risked her life to rescue more than a hundred commune members, was one of the many heroes who rescued people at risk.

    Huang Chan had been on the dike for three days and three nights for emergency rescue. When the flood was about to flood the village, she ran back to the village and helped the masses move their homes household by household. She carried children as soon as she saw them, and carried the old and weak on her back, carrying and hugging more than 100 people out of danger from morning till night. She went through the east alley and the west alley, entering any door she saw. Chen Qinying's family had four children and an elderly blind grandmother. The old were old, and the young were young, and they were always reluctant to leave home. This time, Huang Chan had come to her door for the fourteenth time. When she entered the door, she found that the four children were not there. While persuading her, she searched for them, and finally hugged the children out of the shrine one by one, and sent them and the old lady to a safe place.

    "Have all the commune members in the village evacuated?" Huang Chan was considering. Suddenly, someone called her, "It's time to eat!" She looked up and realized that the person speaking was her mother, and only then did she realize that she had walked to her own home.

    "Mom, why haven't you left yet?"

    Seeing her daughter wearing a wet coat, her mother said with pity and blame, "You haven't eaten since morning till night!"

    But Huang Chan coaxed her mother to leave, and then inspected each house, hungry, until she sent the last four commune members away.

    The flood receded, and the commune members returned to the village. Everyone grasped Huang Chan's hand tightly and said excitedly, "Sister Chan, you are really a good daughter of the Party, our confidante!"

    The broad masses of cadres in the Shantou region, in the struggle against the disaster, have demonstrated a strong will and a self-sacrificing spirit, and have been praised by the broad masses as: "Strong grass in the storm, bosom friends in times of trouble."

    The seven days and nights of struggle have ended, followed by a new battle. Now, the broad masses of cadres in the Shantou region are standing on the front lines of restoring dikes, blocking breaches, and restoring production. They resolutely responded to the call of the Prefectural Party Committee to eliminate the traces of the disaster within three months. Under the leadership of cadres at all levels, only about ten days after the flood receded, the restoration work of the seven major river dikes in the region had been mostly completed, the waterlogged crops had been drained of all the water, more than 350,000 mu of sweet potatoes, miscellaneous grains, and vegetables had been replanted, and 58,000 houses had been built. Shitang Village, Lian'an Commune, Haifeng County, where more than 400 houses were destroyed by the typhoon, rebuilt 212 new houses within five days of the disaster under the leadership of the cadres. A new upsurge of continuous leap forward in the summer harvest and summer planting production has been launched throughout the region.

    狂风暴雨七昼夜
    记汕头专区各级干部在抗洪抢险斗争中的光荣事迹
    本报驻广东记者和通讯员集体采写
    6月初南海上卷起的十二级强台风，疯狂地横扫广东省东部的汕头专区。台风过处，大雨倾盆，山洪飞泄，海浪翻腾。在台风暴雨中，深入到生产第一线的汕头专区各级干部，临危不惧，立即站在抗灾的第一线，领导全区数百万人民，同灾害进行了七个昼夜的激烈搏斗，终于化险为夷，战胜了十二级强台风和有记载以来的韩江最大洪峰。
    在那难忘的七昼夜，多少可歌可泣的事情，在那最危险的海堤、山塘和水库上产生！
    在海岸线上
    在海岸线东端饶平县凤江公社的海堤上，进行着一场险恶的搏斗。
    凤江公社霞中大队党总支副书记张大猪，一直替最薄弱的鱼洞溪堤段担心。可是，拔树掀瓦的暴风，刮得人连行走也困难，怎样能把工具带上海堤抢险呢？他和社员们商量了好久，才想出了一个办法：每人在身上捆缚着三个麻袋，每三个人身上缚一把铁铲，增加体重冲上堤去。社员们在堤上爬爬跌跌，好不容易爬到距离鱼洞溪险段还有几十米的地方时，暴风雨把他们打下堤来。张大猪看到这种情形，迅即站起来，高声喊道：“不要怕！我们一定能保住海堤。共产党员都到我这里来！”张磕、张义有、张扁、张由容、张义溪、张玉虎等六个共产党员，朝着喊声，摸到张大猪的身边。七个人围成一团，手紧扣着手，头靠着头，不让风暴把话声吹散。在风雨交加的堤头上，一个临时紧急的党员会议开始了。张大猪沉着有力地说：“同志们，我们共产党员，要有无产阶级坚强的革命意志，要有‘八女投江’的自我牺牲精神，在这危急关头，要为群众利益而奋不顾身，带头冲上去，保住堤围，保住人民的生命财产。”几分钟的党员会议，统一了党员的意志。张大猪的话，把七个党员的心紧紧地凝结在一起。大家站起来，带头冲往险段去。蹲在堤下的社员，被党员们大无畏的果敢精神所感动。也都一个一个地跟了上来。宽阔的海堤已被风浪削剩一市尺多宽，并已经出现了两个小缺口。张大猪立即指挥社员把两个缺口堵住。
    水库上的搏斗
    强大的台风挟带来的无边无际的暴雨，急骤而集中。汕头专区每一个县，在一两天之间，多的降雨六、七百毫米，少的也有三百毫米，雨量最大时，每小时竟达三十三毫米。这样狂暴迅猛的大雨，一刹时，到处山洪飞泻，浊流遍地。全区大大小小的山塘水库的水位，以每小时二、三十分米的速度飞快上涨着，有的转眼间就满库溢洪。
    一定要保住山塘水库的安全！各个县、各个公社的党委书记们，顶风冒雨，涉水翻山，急急奔赴山塘水库的抗洪最前线。在揭阳水库展开了艰险的保卫水库的战斗。
    7日开始，凶残的暴风雨下了两天两夜，揭阳水库范围内的雨量猛增了七百三十毫米。轰鸣澎湃的山洪万马奔腾般向大坝轮番冲击着。在雷霆万钧的重压下，先是下库主坝两个压力水管的混凝土被冲毁，接着，水管周围坝基的泥土大块大块地被浸蚀，坝面也涌出水来，险情出现了。
    揭阳县委书记袁振山和刘理之星夜赶到现场组织抢险。中共汕头地委第一书记罗天和地委常委余锡渠，也连夜赶来，彻夜不眠地指挥抢救。
    人们跳进险处的急流里，从白天到黑夜，又从黑夜到天明，填沙包，抛石块。可是，抵不住越冲越猛的山洪，坝面坝基仍在一壁壁地剥落。更严重的是，麻袋没有了，其它抢险器材也差不多用光了；大坝通往指挥部的桥又被洪水冲垮，不但器材接济不上，连换班退场的民工也不能回到大坝上来。
    在这紧急的时刻，县委书记袁振山和刘理之跟干部们研究后，决定“不到最后关头，决不离开大坝！”他们一面拨电话向上级求援，一面紧张地在涌水坝面的周围筑一道防水堤，以减少风浪对坝面的冲击，争取时间，等待援救。
    袁振山一夜没有睡觉，也没有吃饭，胃病发作，但他仍然和干部们一起，在强风猛雨中搬沙包，筑防水堤。刘理之则跳下水中，来回扛草把，拦挡洪水。然而，洪水上涨速度比他们筑堤还快，防水堤又被冲出缺口。他们坚持到最后时，仍然奋不顾身，堆草把，填沙包，扔石块……。
    看来，大坝似乎已无法抢救。
    正在这危急关头，一支由四百名解放军组成的援兵来到了。经过一个昼夜的抢险战斗之后，第二天早晨，省委派出的飞机，在水库周围投下了大量抢险器材，一批批支援的民工也源源赶到了。揭阳水库就这样渡过了最高洪水位。
    韩江两岸会师
    台风渐渐减弱，暴雨也收敛了，一个一个的山塘水库转危为安了，可是江河的洪水却一股劲地在上涨。从无数条小河涌上来的水，再加上海潮顶托，使全区最大的河流——韩江的肚子又饱又胀。9日，潮安湘子桥水位一下子就超过警戒线，并且还在继续上涨、上涨……。
    这时，在揭阳县亲自指挥抢救水库的中共汕头地委第一书记罗天，立即赶到韩江来指挥保卫韩江大堤的战斗。捍卫着广阔的潮汕平原数百万人民生命财产安全的韩江大堤，无论如何都得固守呵！公路给水浸了，汽车不能开，心里万分焦急的罗天同志马上卷起裤腿，在黑夜中徒步赶路。原来有风湿病的双腿，给水一泡，又酸又痛，可是，他咬紧牙关，还是一步步的向潮安县的方向走去。到了潮安，他和潮安县委第一书记田荣申研究了护堤的部署，立即又赶回汕头。中午，中共广东省委书记区梦觉、文敏生，秘书长张根生，省水利厅厅长刘兆伦等乘飞机来汕头视察和指挥防洪抢险。他们听了罗天同志的汇报，立即一起来到韩江大堤上。这时，韩江两岸已经集中了三十万人的抗洪队伍。沿江的潮安、澄海、汕头等县市的各级党委负责人都在堤上指挥，省、地、县、公社、大队和小队六级干部都在堤上会师了。他们都要在这里以身作则，吃苦在前，带领广大群众和洪峰搏斗。
    韩江出现了历史上前所未有的特大洪峰，湘子桥水位达到了十六点八八米，比历史上最高的水位还高一毫米。更加紧张的战斗开始了。
    在韩江东岸的堤围上，上欧段的堤外坡忽然被洪水冲塌了十多米，堤身顿时矮了半截，露出水面的只有半米宽的“龙骨”，洪水汹涌地向堤内奔进。
    “堤崩啦！快来人呀！”一阵阵的告急声从附近传来。澄海县隆都公社章籍大队党总支书记许利炎，领着由几十名党团员和积极分子组成的“突击队”飞快地冲上去。许利炎第一个抱着二百来斤重的沙包纵身入水，把沙包填在“龙骨”上，可是洪水随即便把沙包冲走了。接着，几十个“突击队”员也各抱着沙包下水，拼命向“龙骨”填去。许利炎不顾一切，猛地跃上去，狠命地用身躯压在沙包上，不再让洪水冲走。在他的带动下，队员们跟着照样干，“龙骨”上刹那间出现了一层沙包一层人，洪水的凶势稍被压住了。许利炎大声喊叫：“填沙包，快！”顿时，一个个沙包“呯！呯！呯！”地纷纷投下去，“突击队”员们英勇机智地闪开了一个沙包，又压住一个沙包，终于叫“龙骨”迅速升高起来，洪水完全被挡住在堤外了。
    经过四个沸腾的昼夜以后，解放前几乎年年被冲垮的韩江主要堤围，这一次在历史上最大的洪峰面前却安然无恙，全线堤围普遍加高了一到二米，变得更加高大、更加巩固了。
    出生入死救亲人
    主要的海堤、水库、山塘和江河的堤围被保住了。但是，在风、雨、潮、洪四害交加的侵袭下，在一些地方，有的村庄还是不可避免地被洪水淹浸了，有的村庄的大量房屋被暴风刮倒了，人民群众的生命财产受到了严重的威胁，然而这些地方的干部都奋不顾身，甘冒生命危险，去抢救群众的生命，使广大群众脱离了险境。
    9日凌晨，十二级的强台风向沿海的海丰县突袭，风力之猛连二百多年的老树也被连根拔起。仅仅十八个钟头，就把联安公社联川大队石塘村的四百四十四间房子刮倒刮坏了四百三十五间。全村的三十二个干部在副大队长、共产党员洪天泗的率领下，人人头裹毛巾，在风暴狂扫、瓦片飞射的险境里，来回奔跑，抢救群众。
    在这场抢救群众的战斗中，虽然三十多个干部有十多个负了伤，但全村大小六百八十九口人，一个也没有被压伤；全村三十七头耕牛、八十多头猪和四百八十多只鸭也都不曾受到损失。
    在这场抗灾斗争中，有许多抢险救人的英雄，冒险救出一百多个社员的普宁县洪阳公社员山大队党总支书记黄婵妆（女）就是其中的一个。
    黄婵妆上堤抢险已经三天三夜。当洪水快要淹进村庄时，她又跑回村去，逐户帮助群众搬家。她一见小孩就抱，一遇老弱就背，从早到晚一连背抱了一百多人出险。她东巷穿西巷，见门就进。社员陈琴英家有四个小孩和一个年老瞎眼的婆婆，老的老，少的少，一直不愿离家。这回，黄婵妆已经是第十四次上门来了。进门一看，四个小孩都不在。她一边说服，一边找寻，最后在神龛内一个个抱出了小孩，并连老婆婆一块送到安全地方去。
    “全村社员都撤出村了吧？”黄婵妆正在考虑着。突然有人喊她：“该吃饭啦！”她抬头一看，说话的原来是母亲，才知道走到自己的家。
    “妈，你怎么还不走？”
    母亲看到女儿披着一身湿漉漉的衣服，又怜惜又责怪地说：“你从早到晚还没吃饭哩！”
    可是黄婵妆哄了母亲走后，又饿着肚逐家检查，直到把最后的四个社员送走为止。
    洪水退了，社员回村，人人紧握着黄婵妆的手，激动地说：“婵妆姊，你真是党的好女儿，我们的知心人呵！”
    汕头专区的广大干部，在与灾害作斗争中表现了坚强的意志和舍己为群的自我牺牲精神，已被广大群众誉为：疾风中的劲草，患难里的知交。
    七个昼夜的搏斗结束了，紧接着又是一个新的战斗。现在，汕头专区广大干部又站在复堤堵口、恢复生产的第一线上。他们坚决响应地委提出在三个月内消灭灾痕的号召。在各级干部的领导下，洪水消退才不过十天左右，全区七大江河堤围的修复工作绝大部分已经完成，排干了全部受淹农作物的渍水，抢种了番薯、杂粮、蔬菜三十五万多亩，修建了房屋五万八千多间。被台风刮坏了四百多间房屋的海丰县联安公社石塘村，在干部的领导下，灾后五天就重新修起了二百一十二间新房子。一个继续跃进的夏收夏种生产高潮已经在全区展开。
