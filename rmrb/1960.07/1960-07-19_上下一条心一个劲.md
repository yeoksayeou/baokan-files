　　Hearts United in a Single Purpose

　　In the Dasheng Textile Factory No. 1 in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, it is difficult for unfamiliar people to distinguish who is a worker and who is a leading cadre. Whether next to the spinning frame or in front of the loom, one can often see leading cadres wearing work clothes and covered in flying cotton fibers, working alongside the workers. Since 1958, more than 60 leading cadres from the factory headquarters to the workshops have consistently adhered to the practice of eating, living, working, and discussing matters together with the workers.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward, the factory's Party committee has decided that each leading cadre should spend four days a week participating in and leading production on the front lines of production. Subsequently, secretaries, factory directors, union chairmen, Youth League secretaries, section chiefs, workshop directors, and other cadres moved into the workers' dormitory areas. After the leading cadres went deep into the workshops, teams, and groups to work shifts, their work style underwent significant changes. They frequently delved into teams and groups to dissect problems, promote the advanced, help the backward, assist the grassroots in improving their work, and resolve key production issues. In the past, production in the three shifts of the second workshop had been unbalanced. After the workshop's general branch secretary followed the shifts to investigate the situation, it was found that the main reason why Class A's production was inferior to Class B and Class C was that the cadres of this class lacked ambition. Therefore, a workshop cadre meeting was convened to emphasize the production situation and favorable conditions; at the same time, they also helped this class launch a group competition. As a result, it only took three days to bring Class A up to par with Class B and Class C. In the past, broken spinning frames often could not be repaired in time. After the leaders discovered this while working shifts, they promptly organized forces to repair them, ensuring that broken machines were repaired overnight, greatly promoting production. "Four togethers" not only improved production but also strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. The workers sang: "Cadres and workers are of one heart, working together with great enthusiasm, no matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid, and we are united in the Great Leap Forward."

　　上下一条心一个劲
    在江苏省南通市的大生纺织一厂里，不熟悉的人很难分辨出谁是工人，谁是领导干部。无论是在细纱机旁或是织布机前，都可以经常见到一些身穿工作服，满头沾着飞花的领导干部和工人一起忙碌着。这个厂从厂部到车间的六十多个领导干部，从1958年开始，一直坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。
    大跃进以来，这个厂的党委作出了每个领导干部每周四天在生产第一线参加生产、领导生产的决定。接着书记、厂长、工会主席、团委书记、科长、车间主任等干部又搬进工人宿舍区落户。领导干部深入车间、班、组跟班劳动以后，工作作风有了很大的改变。他们经常深入班组解剖麻雀，抓先进帮落后，帮助基层改进工作，解决生产关键。过去第二工场三个班生产一直不平衡，经过工场总支书记跟班摸情况，发现甲班生产不如乙、丙两个班的主要原因是这个班的干部志气不大。于是就召开工场干部会议，大讲生产形势和有利条件；同时还帮助这个班开展小组竞赛。结果只花了三天时间，就使甲班赶上了乙、丙班。过去细纱车坏了常常不能及时修理，领导跟班生产发现后，就及时组织力量抢修，做到坏车修理不过夜，大大促进了生产。“四同”不仅搞好了生产，也密切了干群关系。工人们唱道：“干部工人心连心，干起活来真有劲，天大困难都不怕，齐心合力闹跃进”。
