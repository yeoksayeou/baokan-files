Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th: Two million Italian sharecroppers launched a two-day nationwide strike starting on the 19th. This strike was in response to a call from the Italian General Confederation of Labour, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions (Catholic), and the Italian Labour Federation (Social Democratic Party).

For more than three months, Italian sharecroppers have been fighting for a larger share of agricultural products, a reduction in their share of expenses, and improved treatment. The struggle of the sharecroppers in Bologna Province has already achieved preliminary victory, and their share of certain expenses has been reduced.

At the same time, agricultural workers across Italy have also launched a struggle to support their demands for higher wages and other improvements. Agricultural workers in provinces such as Ferrara, Modena, and Bologna have already held strikes, and agricultural workers in other provinces will also strike during the day.

Female workers in industry have also achieved victory in their struggle for equal pay for equal work with men. This fundamental principle has now been effectively recognized by the Confederation of Italian Industry, and female workers' wages will increase by at least 6% to 10%.

    为争取得到较大份额农产品和提高待遇而斗争
    意大利两百万佃农大罢工
    女工争取同工同酬斗争获得初步胜利
    新华社20日讯　罗马消息：意大利两百万佃农从19日起举行为期两天的全国性大罢工。这次罢工是响应意大利总工会、意大利劳动人民工会联合会（天主教）和意大利劳工联盟（社会民主党）的号召举行的。
    三个多月以来，意大利的佃农一直为争取得到较大份额的农产品、减低所分担的开支份额和提高待遇而斗争。波伦亚省的佃农的斗争已经取得了初步胜利，他们在某些开支方面所负担的份额已经减低。
    在这同时，意大利全国的农业工人也展开了斗争来支持他们关于争取提高工资及其他方面的要求。在斐拉拉、摩德纳和波伦亚等省的农业工人已经举行罢工，其他省份的农业工人也将在日间罢工。
    工业中的女工为争取同男人同工同酬的斗争也取得了胜利。这个基本原则现在实际上已经得到意大利工业家联合会的承认，女工们的工资至少将增加6％到10％。
