　　Xinhua News Agency Report: With the deepening of the national power industry's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many cities in our country have seen more than a hundred remote-controlled substations appear in one or two months.

　　These substations do not require anyone to be on duty. Workers only need to be at the base station several miles away, and they can simultaneously understand the situation of several substations through remote control, remote measurement, and remote communication devices. They can also operate according to the orders of the dispatching room to transform the power transmitted from the power plant into power of various voltages to meet the needs of different users. All substations that have implemented remote control have not only saved a large number of electrical workers but also avoided human error accidents.

　　Currently, all advanced countries in the world are promoting remote control of substations. Our country started in 1956 and has successively trial-produced several sets of remote control devices based on foreign materials. However, these devices are relatively complex, require a lot of equipment and materials, and are not easy to manufacture and promote on a large scale.

　　In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, electrical workers in Liaoning, Beijing, and other places, in order to actively respond to the Party Central Committee's call for mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, adopted indigenous methods and successfully trial-produced a complete set of remote control devices suitable for substations. Compared with the "foreign" devices that were trial-produced in the past, this set of "indigenous" devices has the same efficiency and effect, but saves a lot of equipment and materials, and is simple in structure and easy to operate, making it widely applicable to general substations.

　　Because the remote control work of substations in our country has just begun, it is first being promoted in smaller secondary substations. Recently, electrical workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places have been marching towards primary substations with high technical requirements and have achieved remarkable results.

　　遥控化的变电所
    据新华社讯　随着全国电力工业技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，我国很多城市在一、两个月内就出现了一百多个遥控化的变电所。
    这种变电所不需要有人在那里值班，工人们只要在几里外的基地站，就能通过遥远控制遥远测量遥远通讯的装置同时了解到几个变电所的情况，并根据调度室的命令进行操作，把发电厂输送来的电力变换成各种不同电压的电力，供应不同用户的需要。凡是实行了遥控化的变电所，不仅节省了大批电气工人，而且还能避免人为的误操作事故。
    目前世界各先进国家都在推行变电所的遥控。我国在1956年开始，也曾根据国外资料先后试制成功了几套遥控装置。但是这些装置都比较复杂，需要的设备材料多，不容易大量制造和推广。
    在这次技术革新和技术革命运动中，辽宁、北京等地的电业职工为了积极响应党中央关于机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的号召，采用土法上马的办法，试制成功了一整套适合于变电所使用的完善的遥控装置。这套“土”装置和过去试制过的“洋”装置比较，效率和作用相同，但是设备器材要节省很多，而且结构简单，操作容易，可以广泛适用于一般变电所使用。
    我国变电所的遥控化工作由于还刚开始，首先在范围较小的二次变电所中推行。最近北京、上海、沈阳等地的电气工人已在向技术要求高的一次变电所进军，并且取得了显著成效。
