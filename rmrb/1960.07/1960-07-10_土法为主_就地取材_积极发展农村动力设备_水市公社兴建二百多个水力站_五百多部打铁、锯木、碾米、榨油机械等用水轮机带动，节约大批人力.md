Mainly Indigenous Methods, Utilizing Local Materials, Actively Developing Rural Power Equipment
    Shuishi Commune Builds Over 200 Hydropower Stations
    More Than 500 Blacksmithing, Sawmilling, Rice Milling, Oil Pressing Machines, etc., are Driven by Water Turbines, Saving a Large Amount of Manpower

    (Our dispatch) The Shuishi Commune in Ningyuan County, Hunan Province, using indigenous methods, has built 265 hydropower stations along the crisscrossing streams, rivers, and canals on both sides of the Xiaoshui River. Using water turbines as power, they drive 521 various machines for blowing air, blacksmithing, sawing wood, splitting bamboo, milling rice, grinding flour, pressing oil, pressing sugar, and threshing rice, saving a large amount of manpower.

    Shuishi Commune is a hilly area with undulating mountains. Based on the characteristics of abundant water resources, the Commune Party Committee mobilized the masses to "demand labor from water" using indigenous methods, and conducted a thorough survey of the water resources of each team in the commune, making plans for the construction of hydropower stations. In early February, Chen Songxue, the Commune's Industry Secretary, went deep into the agricultural machinery factory to conduct pilot projects. He and more than 40 workers in the factory surveyed and designed, and quickly built a system using water power to drive blacksmithing, sawmilling, power generation, drilling, air blowing, lathes, drilling machines, etc., realizing the mechanization of more than 20 production processes. After the agricultural machinery factory set an example of water energy utilization, the Commune immediately held an on-site meeting here to summarize and promote the factory's experience, quickly forming a mass movement for the comprehensive utilization of water energy throughout the Commune. In less than three months, the entire Commune established 265 hydropower stations, with 675 horsepower, equivalent to an increase of 5,000 laborers.

    In the high-speed development of hydropower stations, Shuishi Commune adopted the principle of comprehensive utilization, achieving multiple uses of water, making the most of small water sources, special uses of large water sources, using flat water on steep terrain, vitalizing stagnant water, and multiple uses of a single set of equipment. They selected places with high terrain on each flowing water source to block water section by section, setting up factories section by section. On both sides of the Xiaoshui River, where the water flow is the highest, 205 hydropower processing plants were established. In Guiliyuan, Sifang, and other places lacking water resources, methods such as combining ponds, reservoirs, wells, and canals were used to turn small water into large water, stagnant water into flowing water, creating a drop in flat water, and building 75 hydropower stations.

    The processing tools installed using hydropower can generally be used for multiple purposes simultaneously, both milling rice and grinding flour, and can also press oil, press sugar, and process feed. Furthermore, they adhere to the principle of mainly indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods. The construction of all hydropower stations and the assembly of processing tools fully utilize the original old tools such as stone mills and windmills for modification. The water turbines and various gears used as power tools are all made of wood by simple means and using local materials. Therefore, the hydropower stations in Shuishi Commune have the characteristics of simple engineering, easy to obtain materials, rapid construction, and wide application. They are not restricted by terrain and water flow. They can be built in mountainous areas, plains, and places with large or small water sources. They can be used in industrial, agricultural, and livestock production, as well as in the processing of agricultural and sideline products. Moreover, they cost little and yield quick results, generally requiring only about 20 yuan in material costs to build one. All communes in Ningyuan County have proposed: if you want to act quickly, learn from Shuishi; if you want mechanization, use hydropower. The utilization of hydropower quickly developed to more than 2,500 places throughout the county.

### 土法为主　就地取材　积极发展农村动力设备  水市公社兴建二百多个水力站  五百多部打铁、锯木、碾米、榨油机械等用水轮机带动，节约大批人力

    土法为主　就地取材　积极发展农村动力设备
    水市公社兴建二百多个水力站
    五百多部打铁、锯木、碾米、榨油机械等用水轮机带动，节约大批人力
    本报讯　湖南宁远县水市公社用土办法，在潇水两岸纵横交错的溪河渠道上，建起了二百六十五处水力站，以水轮机为动力，带动了五百二十一部鼓风、打铁、锯木、破篾、碾米、磨面、榨油、榨糖和打稻等各种各样的机械，节约了大量人力。
    水市公社是个群山起伏的丘陵地区，公社党委根据水力资源充足的特点，发动群众用土办法“向水要劳力”，并对全公社各队的水力资源进行摸底排队，作出修建水力站的规划。公社工业书记陈宋学在2月初深入农械厂搞试点，和厂内四十多个职工一道勘测设计，很快就建成了用水力带动打铁、锯木、发电、钻眼、鼓风、车床、钻床等，使二十多项生产实现了机械化。农械厂树起水能利用的榜样以后，紧接着公社就在这里召开现场会议，总结和推广这个厂的经验，使水能综合利用很快在全公社内形成群众运动，不到三个月的时间，全公社就建立了二百六十五处水力站，有六百七十五马力，相当于增加五千个劳动力。
    水市公社在高速度发展水力站中，采取了综合利用的原则，做到一水多用，小水大用，大水特用，平水陡用，死水活用和一套设备多种利用。他们在每一条流水上选择地形高的地方节节堵水，节节设厂。在水流量最高的潇水两岸就建立二百零五座水力加工厂，在水力资源缺乏的桂里园、四坊等地，也利用塘库井渠四水合流的办法，使小水变成大水，死水变成活水，平水造成落差，建起水力站七十五座。
    利用水力安装的加工工具一般都能同时作多种用途，既碾米又磨面，能榨油也能榨糖和加工饲料。再就是坚持以土为主、土洋并举的方针，所有水力站的建设和加工工具的装配，都是充分利用原有的碾磨、风车等旧工具改装的。作为动力工具的水轮机和各种齿轮都是因陋就简、就地取材用木头做成的。因此，水市公社的水力站都具有工程简单，取材容易，建成快，用途广的特点，它不受地形水流限制，山区平原，大水小水的地方都能建，工、农、畜牧业生产能用，农副产品加工也能应用，而且花钱少，收效快，一般建一座只需二十来元材料费。宁远县各公社都提出：要想行动快就要学水市，要想机械化就要用水力。全县利用水力很快就发展到二千五百多处。
