　　Release Winston!
　　United States　William Galut
    Recently, a mass rally to fight for the release of Henry Winston was held in Washington Park in Chicago, the second largest city in the United States.
    Winston is a Black fighter and Communist leader imprisoned by the U.S. government. The crime for which he was thrown into prison is because he is Black and a Communist, and because he fought for the civil rights of Blacks. He hopes for an America without racism, without lynching terror and gangster violence; an America dedicated to peace.
    Winston is a victim of the Smith Act. Even former U.S. President Truman himself admitted that the Smith Act is unconstitutional. During his presidency, this law was used to undermine the constitutional rights of the people. Although Truman believed it was unconstitutional, he never used executive power to help the many victims of the Smith Act. Eisenhower was the same. On the contrary, their governments used this evil law to suppress academic freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. What is especially serious is that this reactionary law was used to strengthen police surveillance activities, and to condone racists and instigate mobs to use violence against Blacks and against those who demand democratic rights for Blacks.
    The "Strive for the Release of Henry Winston" conference held in Chicago will undoubtedly promote the development of the American people's struggle. The struggle of the American people for civil rights, social progress, and world peace is booming. Influenced and encouraged by the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the struggle of the American people will inevitably strengthen the struggles of the colonial people for liberation and of all oppressed people for freedom. The main purpose of the Chicago conference was to demand that the Eisenhower government release Winston. He was a fighter during World War II, and has become blind in both eyes and paralyzed in both legs while being detained by the government as a political prisoner. No matter how much the U.S. government plays tricks, it cannot say that such an incapacitated person "threatens national security." The continued persecution of Winston can only provide new evidence of the brutality of the American rulers. A ruling class that barbarously persecutes its own people is obviously unlikely to treat the people of other countries it believes it can conquer peacefully.
    Winston was born in the southern United States, and he personally tasted the barbaric persecution that his compatriots have endured for hundreds of years. He personally witnessed the Republican and Democratic parties allowing the rampant lynching of Blacks; saw the ideology of white supremacy spread throughout the country, poisoning the minds of hundreds of thousands of people; saw the barbaric persecution of Blacks through racism, which was also used to persecute hundreds of thousands of white men, women, and youth in other strata of American society. Winston understood that this cruel situation would not be completely changed no matter which party, Republican or Democratic, was in power. His life experience drove him to explore in depth the root causes of the misery of his compatriots. He found this cause, and exercised his constitutionally guaranteed political right to join the Communist Party.
    However, Blacks and Communists are deprived of this right. During the trial, those avaricious prosecutors and judges who regarded convicting Communists as a way to get promoted, ferociously violated the right to freedom of political belief. They were unable to bring any criminal charges against Winston, but they persecuted him relentlessly.
    This heroic Black man waged a noble battle to be a free man. Winston was determined not to allow the government to fabricate facts and imprison him. For the five years up to 1956, he went into hiding. When McCarthyism had been defeated, and it seemed that the possibility of guaranteeing the people's struggle under the Constitution had increased, he showed himself. However, some judges who still regarded persecuting Communists and Blacks as a shortcut to promotion illegally sentenced Winston to five years in prison, and then added another three years. The "reason" was that he refused to obey unconstitutional legal proceedings. This is how bourgeois American justice is enforced domestically.
    Winston has been imprisoned for four years of his eight-year sentence. He is currently almost completely blind and severely paralyzed. However, he is still being imprisoned and is being denied parole for treatment. In 1959, Winston's condition was very serious. He and his legal counsel repeatedly applied for medical treatment, but the prison doctor only gave him a cursory examination. It was not until this year, when the government could no longer cover up his health condition, that he received a medical examination. But this was still won through struggle.
    The results of the examination revealed that he had a brain tumor. Surgery revealed that it was not malignant. However, due to prolonged lack of treatment, his health had been severely damaged. Winston himself, as well as his family, friends, and legal counsel, once again applied to the government for parole for treatment, but their requests were unreasonably rejected. It was not until weeks ago that the government sent him to Staten Island, where there is only the most basic medical equipment.
    The brutality with which U.S. imperialism treats Winston demonstrates its extreme hatred for people of color around the world who demand equal rights and for people who fight for freedom.
    Winston's case has angered hundreds of thousands of people at home and abroad. American monopoly groups are desperately trying to conceal the truth, denying that there are political prisoners in the United States. However, eighteen million Black citizens are currently in a position tantamount to political prisoners and social pariahs. The Eisenhower government's treatment of Winston is inseparable from the barbaric traditions of American slavery, racial discrimination, and racial segregation. These "traditions" not only violate the U.S. Constitution, but also the UN Charter, especially the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is why all those who uphold human rights and human dignity cannot but be concerned about this case.
    The struggle to release Winston is a struggle for democracy in the United States. Winston's case cannot be separated from other struggles for freedom currently underway in the United States. Demanding the release of Winston is a struggle to end racism. Demanding the release of Winston is the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and liberation. Let the struggle to release Winston become part of the struggle to release all political prisoners who have been persecuted for opposing U.S. aggression and reactionary policies. The mass rally in Washington Park in Chicago will bring the struggle to release Winston to a climax and make the American people's struggle for democracy and peace more vigorous.

### 释放温斯顿！

　　释放温斯顿！
　　美国　威廉·高尔特
    最近，在美国第二大城市芝加哥的华盛顿公园里，举行了争取释放亨利·温斯顿的群众大会。
    温斯顿是被美国政府监禁的一位黑人战士和共产党领袖，他被投入监狱的罪名，是由于他是一个黑人和共产党员，并且为争取黑人的公民权利而进行斗争。他希望有一个没有种族主义、没有私刑恐怖和匪徒暴行的美国；一个致力于和平的美国。
    温斯顿是史密斯法的受害者。连美国前任总统杜鲁门自己也曾承认史密斯法是违反宪法的。在他担任总统期间，这项法律被用来破坏人民的宪法权利。尽管杜鲁门认为它违反宪法，但是他从未运用行政权力，去帮助许多史密斯法的受害者。艾森豪威尔也是一样。相反的，他们的政府都利用了这项罪恶的法律来压制学术自由、言论自由、出版自由和集会自由。尤其严重的是，这个反动的法律被用来加强警察的监视活动，纵容种族主义者和鼓动暴徒对黑人和对那些要求给黑人民主权利的人采取暴力手段。
    芝加哥举行的“争取释放亨利·温斯顿”大会，无疑将推动美国人民斗争的发展。美国人民争取公民权利、社会进步和世界和平的斗争正在蓬勃开展。受到亚非和拉丁美洲人民斗争影响和鼓舞的美国人民的斗争，无可避免地反过来加强殖民地人民争取解放和一切被压迫人民争取自由的斗争。芝加哥大会主要的目的，就是要求艾森豪威尔政府释放温斯顿。他是第二次世界大战期间的一位战士，在被政府作为政治犯拘留期间，已经双眼失明和两腿瘫痪了。不管美国政府如何玩弄欺骗手腕，总不能说这样一个已失去活动能力的人“威胁国家安全”。温斯顿继续受到的迫害，只能为美国统治者的残暴提供新的证据。一个野蛮迫害本国人民的统治阶级，对它认为自己能够征服的其他国家的人民，显然是不可能会和平对待的。
    温斯顿生于美国南部，他曾亲身尝到了他的同胞已经忍受了数百年的野蛮迫害。他亲眼看到共和党和民主党放任残害黑人的私刑盛行；看到白种人优越的思想在国内蔓延，毒害了成千上万人的心灵；看到野蛮迫害黑人的种族主义，同样被用来迫害美国社会其他阶层成千上万的白种男女和青年。温斯顿了解，不论共和党或者民主党掌权，这种残酷的情况都不会彻底改变。他的生活经验驱使他深入去探索造成他的同胞悲惨处境的根本原因。他找到这种原因，就行使了获得宪法保证的政治权利，加入了共产党。
    但是，黑人和共产党人是被剥夺了这项权利的。在审讯过程中，那些把共产党人治罪视为升官途径的利欲熏心的检察官和法官们，穷凶极恶地侵犯了政治信仰自由的权利。他们没有能对温斯顿提出任何刑事罪名，但是却对他横加迫害。
    这位英勇的黑人，为了争取做一个自由人进行了崇高的战斗。温斯顿决心不让政府捏造事实而把他关进监牢。到1956年为止的五年中，他隐蔽起来。当麦卡锡主义已被击败，看来保证人民根据宪法进行斗争的可能性增加了，他才露面。但是，仍然有一些把迫害共产党人和黑人当作升官捷径的法官，竟非法地把温斯顿除判处五年徒刑，另外又再加上三年徒刑。“理由”是他拒绝服从违反宪法的诉讼程序。这就是美国资产阶级司法在国内执行的方式。
    温斯顿在八年徒刑中，已经被监禁了四年。目前他几乎已完全失明和严重瘫痪。但是，他仍然被监禁，并且被拒绝准许假释以便进行治疗。1959年温斯顿的病情很严重，他和他的法律顾问一再申请就医，监狱的医生只草率地给他诊治了一下。到了今年政府对他的健康情况再已无法掩盖时，他才得到一次医疗检查。但是这还是经过斗争才赢得的。
    检查的结果，发现他患了大脑肿瘤。开刀后查明非恶性肿瘤。但由于长久没有获得治疗，已经严重损害了健康。温斯顿自己以及他的家庭、朋友和法律顾问，再次向政府申请给予假释进行治疗，但是他们的要求却遭到了无理拒绝。直到数周之前，政府才把他送到斯塔腾岛去，那里只有最简单的医疗设备。
    美帝国主义对待温斯顿的残暴态度，表明了它对全世界要求平等权利的有色人种和对为争取自由的人民的极端仇恨。
    温斯顿案件激怒了美国国内外成千上万的人们。美国垄断集团拼命设法隐蔽事实真相，它否认美国国内有着政治犯。然而，一千八百万黑色公民目前却千真万确地处于形同政治犯和社会贱民的地位。艾森豪威尔政府对待温斯顿，是同美国的奴隶制度、种族歧视和种族隔离的野蛮传统分不开的。这些“传统”不仅违反了美国宪法，而且违反了联合国宪章，特别是违反了世界人权宣言。这就是一切维护人权和人类尊严的人们不能不关心这个案件的原因。
    争取释放温斯顿的斗争，是美国国内争取民主的斗争。不能把温斯顿的案件同目前美国国内正在进行的其他争取自由的斗争割裂起来。要求释放温斯顿就是争取结束种族主义的斗争。要求释放温斯顿，就是各国人民争取和平与解放的斗争。让要求释放温斯顿的斗争成为争取释放所有因反对美国侵略和反动政策而遭到迫害的政治犯的斗争的一部分。芝加哥华盛顿公园的群众大会，将把要求释放温斯顿的斗争引向高潮，并使美国人民争取民主和和平的斗争更蓬勃地开展。
