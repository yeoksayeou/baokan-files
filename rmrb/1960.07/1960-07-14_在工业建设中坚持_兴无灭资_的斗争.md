Let the proletarian way of running enterprises be carried forward

    In the process of production and construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Group (An'gang) thoroughly destroyed the bourgeois way of running enterprises and established the proletarian way of running enterprises. The basic content of this line is: adhere to the leadership of the Party, implement the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee; adhere to putting politics in command and regard political work as the lifeline of economic work; adhere to vigorously launching mass movements and rely on the masses to run enterprises; adhere to continuous revolution; adhere to the general line and the Great Leap Forward. The proletarian way of running enterprises is the concrete embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought in economic work and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The firm establishment of this proletarian way of running enterprises in An'gang has extremely important political significance. This fact means that China's socialist enterprise management has a set of relatively complete guiding principles that combine Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, which will have a far-reaching impact on China's socialist construction.

    The proletarian way of running enterprises is a superstructure built on the socialist economic base. Its formation and establishment have played and are playing a significant role in promoting the continuous reform of production relations and the development of productive forces. Marxism believes that in the relationship between productive forces and production relations, productive forces play a decisive role, but under certain conditions, changes in production relations can also become a decisive factor in promoting the development of productive forces; in the relationship between the economic base and the superstructure, the economic base plays a decisive role, but in a certain period, changes in the superstructure can become a decisive factor in promoting the development of production relations. Under China's socialist conditions, productive forces and production relations, the economic base and the superstructure are basically adapted to each other, which is the fundamental reason for the rapid development of China's production and construction. At the same time, however, contradictions also exist between them, which need to be constantly adjusted and resolved. As far as the superstructure is concerned, due to the existence of remnants of the old bourgeois superstructure, it is in contradiction with socialist production relations. Therefore, it must go through continuous struggle to continuously improve the new socialist superstructure in order to better promote the great development of socialist construction. The proletarian way of running enterprises was established through long-term and fierce struggle under such circumstances. In An'gang, some people in the past opposed the leadership of the Party and advocated that a few people decide everything; opposed putting politics in command and emphasized material incentives; opposed vigorously launching mass movements and advocated relying on a few experts and technicians to run enterprises; opposed continuous revolution and high speed and advocated "stability" and following old rules, etc. This was a bourgeois way of running enterprises. Under the influence of this erroneous ideology and line, the leadership of the Party was greatly weakened in some factories and mines in An'gang, and production and construction could not achieve the high-speed development it should have. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees, the Party organization, the vast number of Party members, and the masses of workers in An'gang have carried out continuous struggles against the erroneous bourgeois way of running enterprises, and finally established the proletarian way of running enterprises, thereby making the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, continuous revolution, and high speed the criteria for guiding production and construction. Practice has proved that this proletarian way of running enterprises is the most in line with the requirements of China's socialist economic relations and the most capable of fully and widely mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Once it is established and consolidated, it shows its great superiority, powerfully promotes the transformation of production relations, greatly enhances people's ideological awareness, thereby forming a huge material force and promoting the great leap forward in production and the great development of the technical revolution movement.

    The formation and establishment of the proletarian way of running enterprises fully demonstrates that people's political and ideological conditions (i.e., ideology) play a major decisive role in production and construction. That is to say, people's subjective initiative has extremely important significance for promoting the development of production and construction. In the past, in An'gang, some people were very superstitious and conservative, prostrating themselves before "economic laws," believing that foreign enterprises were large and advanced and had a set of fixed and immutable order that could not be touched, otherwise it would cause chaos in production. Leaving aside whether the "economic laws" they worship are real economic laws and whether the order of foreign enterprises cannot be touched, now we might as well seriously study the relationship between people's subjective initiative and economic laws. Marxists have always believed that economic laws exist objectively and must be followed, but they also believe that people are not powerless in the face of economic laws, and that people can understand, grasp, and use them to benefit mankind. Correctly understanding economic laws requires giving full play to people's subjective initiative, and similarly, mastering and applying economic laws also requires giving full play to people's subjective initiative. Without the leadership of the Party, without putting politics in command, without mass movements, etc., can economic laws be correctly understood, grasped, and applied? Of course not. Because only by strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command can we improve our political and ideological level, improve our ability to analyze objective things, and be able to grasp its essence and find its inherent laws (including the laws of economic construction) in the complex phenomena, so as to correctly understand and master objective laws. In the process of understanding and mastering objective laws, and on the basis of respecting objective laws, it is necessary to give full play to people's subjective initiative to fully utilize economic laws. This requires even more strengthening the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, mobilizing the enthusiasm, creativity, wisdom, and strength of the broad masses, realizing continuous revolution, and promoting the high-speed development of socialist construction. We Communists have always advocated: under the condition of respecting objective laws, we always put people's revolutionary spirit and subjective initiative in the most important position. In fact, in engaging in production and construction, it is not enough to only talk about production. To do a good job in production, we must first talk about ideology, talk about principles and policies, talk about work style and leadership methods, and talk about revolutionary drive and the spirit of striving for progress. These are basically issues related to ideology, that is, issues of subjective initiative. The reason why An'gang has a completely new look, is thriving, has greatly improved production, and has greatly developed the technical revolution movement is precisely the result of breaking superstitions, breaking old rules and regulations, establishing the proletarian way of running enterprises, and giving full play to people's subjective initiative. This fully demonstrates the importance of ideology. For the country as a whole, the reason why China's socialist construction can develop at a high speed and the people's subjective initiative can be fully exerted is one of the important and fundamental reasons.

    The proletarian way of running enterprises established by An'gang is not only suitable for large enterprises, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises; not only suitable for production departments, but also for non-production departments; not only suitable for economic work, but also for all work. We all know that any enterprise, any department, and any work must without exception strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, continuously revolutionize, and adhere to the general line and the Great Leap Forward. This is a fundamental issue and a key issue for successfully realizing continuous revolution and high-speed socialist construction. Therefore, any department or any work should actively and conscientiously implement the spirit of the proletarian way of running enterprises. In fact, this is a matter of firmly consolidating and strengthening the leadership of the Party, and a matter of giving full play to people's subjective initiative. The establishment of the proletarian way of running enterprises is the result of struggle, and in the process of implementing this line, it will inevitably encounter some obstacles and require some struggle. This struggle is necessary and meaningful. Only by thoroughly defeating the non-proletarian ideas of being superstitious about books, superstitious about dogmas, superstitious about material incentives, superstitious about the "ability" of a few people, and prostrating oneself before objective laws can the principles of the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, continuously revolutionizing, and building socialism at high speed be firmly established, and can the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people be mobilized to develop production more, faster, better, and more economically and to do a good job.

The Struggle Between Two Lines in Technical Work

    The socialist construction is developing rapidly, and new imbalances and new contradictions are constantly emerging. For example, the contradictions that are often encountered are insufficient labor, insufficient raw materials, insufficient equipment, insufficient technical strength, insufficient transportation capacity, and insufficient management experience. History constantly raises new questions, requiring us to answer and to show our attitude. In the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, a struggle between two lines has unfolded.

    The first struggle is whether the proletariat leads or the technical personnel "dictate"? Since technical work must serve proletarian politics, it must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party. Every cadre engaged in technical work must consciously obey the leadership of the Party and believe that the Party can lead. However, the bourgeois idea that "technology is technology" and "technology is not politics" is not without influence in our enterprises. The most prominent manifestation of this ideological influence is: disbelief that we can quickly master and develop technical work under the guidance of the general line, mystifying technical work to the extent that even the Party cannot lead it, mystifying it to the extent that it is not governed by dialectical laws. People with this kind of thinking blindly worship technical personnel, regard technical work as a rope that binds their hands and feet, causing themselves to deviate from the leadership of the Party and daring not walk freely. What is the fact? In the Great Leap Forward, we have trained a large number of technicians, engineers, and skilled workers at a high speed, enabling us to master countless new types of enterprises.

    The second struggle is the dispute between limited revolution and continuous revolution. Some people generally admit that technical work can continuously develop, but they do not admit it on specific issues. They are superstitious about "authority" and believe that things that have not been done abroad cannot be done by us, disbelieving in the wisdom of the Chinese working people. They believe that things not written in books cannot be done by us, they do not know that books are written by people, and we can also write new books; they believe that the leap forward is limited, the extent of the leap forward must decrease, and finally it will stagnate, they do not know that the uninterrupted movement and development is the objective law of the development of things. People with this kind of thinking often look back and feel satisfied with having improved several times compared to the past. In fact, what is so great about improving several times compared to the past? A country that has been invaded and oppressed for a long time and is very backward, to catch up with the modern world level in all aspects, is not a matter of improving several times, but a matter of improving countless times.

    The third question is: the dispute between a few people doing technical work and relying on the masses to do technical work. People with a mysterious view believe that technical work cannot be done by ordinary people, and that only a few brilliant people can master it. In fact, these people do not understand: the most advanced equipment is also manufactured by ordinary working people, and it is also used by working people, so the working people themselves are the most familiar with the technology in it. They absolutely separate the masses of workers from the production process, they absolutely separate manual labor from mental labor, believing that ordinary workers do not need to participate in all advanced technologies. In fact, the entire staff and workers are most familiar with the situation of a factory, not a few engineering and technical personnel.

    The fourth question is: Should theory be combined with practice? Or should theory be separated from practice? Some people believe that those who are in charge of improving do not need to popularize, and those who are engaged in popularization do not need to care about improving; those who manufacture general products do not need to think about manufacturing advanced products, and those who manufacture advanced products do not need to care about the production of general products. Therefore, they advocate that laboratories, research institutes, and design agencies do not need to contact general production workers, let alone absorb their experience. They believe that theory is formed once, is discovered by a few smart people, and do not believe that theory is formed by relying on continuous development in practice. Correct theory correctly reflects objective laws, and as things develop and conditions change, objective laws also constantly change; there are no laws in the world that stop developing, and there are no theories in the world that are perfect to the point of being unaddable. The practice of the broad masses of working people is the most extensive, most in-depth, and most abundant experiment. Whoever can rely on the masses to the greatest extent and summarize the experience of the masses to the greatest extent can make the most outstanding creations in technical work. Whoever can most inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can also best lead the technical work of a unit.

    The fifth question is: The dispute between walking on two legs and valuing the foreign while devaluing the indigenous.

“Indigenous” and “foreign” are relative. What is “indigenous” in China becomes “foreign” in foreign countries. Aren’t our tea, silk and porcelain considered “foreign” when they go abroad? And what is foreign becomes China’s foreign stuff when it comes here. However, because we have suffered more than a hundred years of imperialist aggression, the word "indigenous" has taken on a bad meaning in China, and many people have equated the word "indigenous" with the word "bad." In fact, the word "indigenous" in the policy of walking on two legs does not have this meaning. This word "indigenous" refers to the good experiences that our working people have already created, which must be inherited and carried forward. We have our own creations in all technical aspects. These are under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, learning from foreign technology, combining with China's actual conditions, and created through the practice of the Chinese people. Therefore, this is a Chinese-style thing. This technology has the broadest mass character and the most convenient conditions for application, and it has the most realistic role in building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

These five aspects of struggle are precisely the struggle between two ideologies and two lines in technical work. This struggle, with the development of socialist construction, is not weakening, but becoming increasingly profound and widespread. Wherever technical transformation is carried out, wherever industries are built, wherever there is technical work, there will be this kind of struggle.

### 在工业建设中坚持“兴无灭资”的斗争

    在工业建设中坚持“兴无灭资”的斗争
　　让无产阶级办企业的路线发扬光大
    鞍钢在生产建设过程中，彻底摧毁了资产阶级办企业的路线，树立了无产阶级办企业的路线。这个路线的基本内容就是：坚持党的领导，实行党委领导下的厂长负责制；坚持政治挂帅，把政治工作作为经济工作的生命线；坚持大搞群众运动，依靠群众办企业；坚持不断革命；坚持总路线、大跃进。无产阶级办企业的路线，是毛泽东思想在经济工作中的具体体现，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这一无产阶级办企业的路线，在鞍钢牢固地树立起来，有着极为重大的政治意义。这个事实意味着，我国的社会主义企业管理有了一套比较完整的马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的指导原则，它对我国的社会主义建设将发生极为深远的影响。
    无产阶级办企业的路线，是建立在社会主义经济基础上的上层建筑，它的形成和确立，对促进生产关系不断变革和生产力的发展起了和正在起着重大的推动作用。马克思主义认为，在生产力与生产关系的关系中，生产力是起决定作用的，但在一定条件下生产关系的改变也会成为推动生产力发展的决定因素；在经济基础与上层建筑的关系中，经济基础是起决定作用的，但在一定时期上层建筑的改变又会成为推动生产关系发展的决定因素。在我国的社会主义条件下，生产力与生产关系、经济基础与上层建筑基本上是相适应的，这是我国生产建设得以迅速发展的根本原因。但同时它们之间也存在着矛盾，需要不断地加以调整和解决。就以上层建筑来说，由于旧的资产阶级的上层建筑残余的存在，它与社会主义生产关系是有矛盾的，因此必须经过不断的斗争，才能使新的社会主义的上层建筑不断地完善，才能更好地促进社会主义建设事业的大发展。无产阶级办企业的路线，就是在这样情况下，经过长期的激烈的斗争确立起来的。在鞍钢，过去有些人反对党的领导，主张少数人决定一切；反对政治挂帅，强调物质刺激；反对大搞群众运动，主张依靠少数专家和技术人员办企业；反对不断革命和高速度，主张“四平八稳”按老规矩办事，等等。这是一套资产阶级办企业的路线。在这种错误的思想和路线的影响下，曾使鞍钢某些厂矿极大的削弱了党的领导，生产建设得不到应有的高速度的发展。鞍钢的党组织、广大党员和职工群众，在党中央和省市委的正确领导下，对资产阶级办企业的错误路线进行了不断的斗争，终于树立了无产阶级办企业的路线，从而使党的领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动、不断革命和高速度成为指导生产和建设的准则。实践证明，这条无产阶级办企业的路线，是最符合我国社会主义经济关系的要求的，是最能充分地广泛地调动广大群众积极性的。它一经确立和巩固，就显示了它的巨大的优越性，有力地推动了生产关系的变革，使人们的思想觉悟极大地提高，从而形成了巨大的物质力量，促进了生产大跃进和技术革命运动的大发展。
    无产阶级办企业路线的形成和确立，充分地说明了人们的政治思想状况（即意识形态）在生产建设中起着重大的决定性的作用。也就是说人们的主观能动作用，对推动生产建设的发展有极为重大的意义。过去在鞍钢，有一些人很迷信、很保守，拜倒“经济规律”脚下，认为大洋企业既大且洋，有一套固定不变的秩序，这套秩序是碰不得的，一碰它就会造成生产上的混乱。且不说他们所崇拜的“经济规律”是不是真正的经济规律，大洋企业的秩序是否碰不得，现在我们不妨认真地研究一下人们的主观能动作用同经济规律的关系。马克思主义者一向认为经济规律是客观存在的，必须按经济规律办事，但认为人们在经济规律面前并不是无能为力的，人们是可以认识、掌握和运用它来为人类造福的。正确认识经济规律要充分发挥人们的主观能动作用，同样，掌握与运用经济规律也要发挥人们的主观能动作用。不要党的领导，不要政治挂帅，不要群众运动等，能否正确认识、掌握与运用经济规律？当然不能。因为只有加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，才能提高我们的政治思想水平，才能提高我们对客观事物的分析能力，也才能够在纷繁复杂的现象中抓住其本质、找到它固有的规律（包括经济建设的规律），从而正确地认识与掌握客观规律。在认识与掌握客观规律并在尊重客观规律的基础上，又必须充分发挥人们的主观能动作用，来充分地利用经济规律。这就更需要加强党的领导、坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，调动广大群众的积极性、创造性、智慧和力量，实现不断革命，促进社会主义建设事业高速度发展。我们共产党人从来就主张：在尊重客观规律的条件下，总是把人们的革命精神和主观能动作用放到头等的重要的地位。其实，搞生产建设，光讲生产是不行的，要想搞好生产首先必须讲思想，讲方针政策，讲工作作风和领导方法，讲革命干劲和奋发图强的上进精神。这些基本上都是属于意识形态方面的问题，也就是主观能动作用的问题。鞍钢之所以面貌焕然一新，欣欣向荣，生产大提高，技术革命运动大发展，正是破除了迷信、破除了陈规旧律、树立了无产阶级办企业的思想和路线的结果，正是充分发挥人们主观能动作用的结果。这里充分表现了意识形态的重要性。就全国来说，我国的社会主义建设之所以能够高速度地发展，人民群众主观能动作用的充分发挥，就是其中一个重要的根本的原因。
    鞍钢所树立的无产阶级办企业的路线，不仅适合大企业，而且也适合中小企业；不仅适合生产部门，而且也适合非生产部门；不仅适合经济工作，而且也适合一切工作。我们都知道，任何企业、任何部门和任何工作，都无一例外的必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不断革命和坚持总路线、大跃进。这是一个根本问题，是胜利地实现不断革命和高速度建设社会主义的关键问题。因此，任何部门或任何工作，都应该积极地认真地贯彻执行无产阶级办企业路线的精神。实际上，这就是坚定地巩固与加强党的领导的问题，是充分发挥人的主观能动作用的问题。无产阶级办企业的路线的树立是经过斗争的，在贯彻执行这个路线的时候，也必然会碰到某些障碍，要经过一些斗争。这个斗争是必要的，有意义的，只有把迷信书本、迷信教条、迷信物质刺激、迷信少数人“能力”，拜倒客观规律脚下的那一套非无产阶级思想彻底搞垮，才能把党的领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动、不断革命和高速度建设社会主义的原则牢固地树立起来，才能够把广大人民的积极性调动起来，多快好省地发展生产，做好工作。

　  在技术工作中两条路线的斗争
    社会主义建设事业一日千里地发展着，新的不平衡、新的矛盾不断地出现着。比如经常遇到的矛盾就是劳动力不足，原材料不足，设备不足，技术力量不足，运输力量不足，管理经验不足。历史不断地提出新问题，要求我们答复，要求我们表明态度。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，展开了两条路线的斗争。
    第一个斗争，是无产阶级领导还是技术人员“专政”？技术工作既然要为无产阶级政治服务，就必须置于党的绝对领导之下，每个从事技术工作的干部都要自觉地服从党的领导，并且相信党能够领导。可是，“技术就是技术”、“技术不是政治”的资产阶级思想，在我们的企业里，并不是没有影响的。这种思想影响最突出的表现在：不相信我们能够在总路线的指引下，迅速地掌握并且发展技术工作，把技术工作神秘化起来，神秘到连党也不能领导它的程度，神秘到它不受辩证规律支配的程度。有这种思想的人，便盲目崇拜技术人员，便把技术工作当成束缚自己手脚的绳索，使自己离开党的领导，使自己不敢自由走路。事实如何呢？在大跃进中，我们已经高速度地锻炼出了大批的技术员、工程师、技术工人，使我们能够掌握无数的新型企业。
    第二个斗争，是有限革命与不断革命之争。有些人一般地承认技术工作能够不断发展，可是在具体问题上不承认。他们迷信“权威”，认为外国还没有办到的事情，咱们也就办不到，不相信中国劳动人民的智慧。他们认为书上没有写出来的东西，咱们也就不能办到，他们不知道书是人写的，我们也可以写出新书来；他们认为跃进有限度，跃进幅度必然递减，最后就要停滞，他们不知道不停息的运动发展，乃是事物发展的客观规律。有这种思想的人常常向回看，认为比过去提高了几倍，便满足了。其实比过去提高几倍又有什么了不起？一个长期被侵略被压迫弄得非常落后的国家，要从各个方面赶上世界现代水平，就不是提高几倍的问题，而是提高不知多少倍的问题。
    第三个问题是：少数人做技术工作与依靠群众做技术工作之争。有神秘观点的人，认为技术工作非常人可做，认为只有少数的高明人物才能掌握。其实这些人不懂得：最高级的设备，也是普通劳动人民制造的，也是劳动人民使用的，所以，最熟悉其中技术的还是劳动人民自己。他们把职工群众在生产过程中绝对分割开来，他们把体力劳动与脑力劳动绝对分割，认为凡是高级技术，普通工人不必参与。其实，最熟悉一个工厂情况的，还是全体职工，不会是几个工程技术人员。
    第四个问题是：理论与实践相结合呢？还是理论与实践相分割呢？有的人认为管提高的不必搞普及，搞普及的不必关心提高；制造一般产品的不必想制造高级产品，制造高级产品的不必关心一般产品的生产。所以，他们主张试验室、研究所、设计机关，不必和一般生产工人接触，更不需要吸取他们的经验。他们认为：理论是一次形成的，是少数聪明人发现的，不认为理论是依靠实践不断发展形成的。正确的理论，正确地反映客观规律，事物发展，条件变化，客观规律也不断变化；世界上没有停止发展的规律，世界上也没有完善到无以复加的理论。广大劳动人民的实践，是最广泛、最深入、最丰富的实验。谁能够
  最大限度地依靠群众，最大限度地总结群众经验，他就能够在技术工作上做出最突出的创造。谁最能够鼓舞群众的积极性与创造性，他也就最能够领导好一个单位的技术工作。
    第五个问题是：土洋并举与重洋轻土之争。
  “土”与“洋”是相对的，中国之“土”，到外国则为“洋”，我们的茶叶、丝绸、瓷器到了外国不就是“洋”的了么？外国的东西到了中国就成了中国的洋东西。不过，由于我们受了一百多年的帝国主义侵略，“土”字在中国增加了一个坏的含义，许多人把“土”字与“坏”字当成了同义语了。其实，土洋并举方针中的土字并不是这个含义。这个土字是指的我国劳动人民已经创造的好经验，必须继承下来，发扬起来。我们在一切技术方面都有自己的创造。这些是在马克思列宁主义指导下，学习了外国技术，结合了中国的实际情况，经过中国人民的实践创造出来的。因而这是中国型的东西。这种技术有着最广泛的群众性，有着最便于运用的条件，它对于多快好省地建设社会主义也就有着最现实的作用。
    这五个方面的斗争，正是技术工作中两种思想、两条路线之争。这个斗争，随着社会主义建设的发展，不是减弱，而是日益深刻、广泛起来。哪个地方进行技术改造，哪个地方兴建工业，哪个地方有技术工作，哪个地方就会有这种斗争。
