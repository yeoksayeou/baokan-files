From our correspondent in Guiyang, July 5th. Dejiang County, Guizhou Province, is making full use of the stalks, husks, and leaves of summer harvest crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans to vigorously promote comprehensive utilization and a "one-stop" processing system. Since the end of May, in just one month, the county has established more than 1,200 small factories for papermaking, winemaking, sugar boiling, alkali production, and starch processing, and more than 1,700 feed processing plants. They have produced a total of over 5.9 million catties of products such as sugar, wine, paper, alkali, pastries, starch, and feed, worth over 450,000 yuan.

As early as the beginning of the summer harvest, the Dejiang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China studied and arranged for the processing and comprehensive utilization of summer harvest agricultural and sideline products. The County Party Secretary and the Minister of Industry and Communications were responsible for experimenting with the "one-stop" processing and comprehensive utilization of wheat straw. They developed a method of first boiling sugar from wheat straw, using the sugar residue to make wine, and then using the wine lees to make paper pulp and paper. In this way, every 100 catties of wheat straw can produce five catties of sugar, six catties of wine, and 100 catties of paper pulp, with a total output value of 44 yuan.

Under the strong leadership of the County Party Committee, a mass movement for the "one-stop" processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products has been widely carried out throughout the county. Communes and production teams have transferred a group of commune members to engage in the processing of agricultural and sideline products. Since mid-May, the Pingyuan Commune has established 39 agricultural and sideline product processing plants, each equipped with three to five workers and led by the deputy captain of the production team. In just half a month, the commune has produced more than 800 catties of sugar from wheat straw and rapeseed stalks. In the Chaodi Commune, the Tuanjie, Shangba, Fengxi, and Yuanchang production teams of the Yuanchang Management District have established 20 paper mills, which can produce more than 10,000 catties of finished and semi-finished products every day. The Wenping Commune also uses buckwheat stalks, rapeseed stalks, pea husks, leaves, and stalks to produce earth alkali, starch, paper pulp, and white wine. The county winery has used agricultural and sideline products to brew eight tons of white wine.

In order to support the development of agricultural and sideline product processing and comprehensive utilization, county-level departments actively help production team processing plants solve the difficulties of insufficient funds and equipment. The commercial departments implemented a guaranteed sales system for the products of each factory and sent more than 50 employees to work with each factory to conduct experiments and set up eight "one-stop" comprehensive processing plants. In order to overcome transportation difficulties, factories are generally built in the raw material production areas or along transportation lines. County-run factories and commune-run factories closely integrate all aspects of agricultural and sideline product processing and utilization. For example, starch, sugar making, winemaking, papermaking, and pastry processing plants have implemented a "one-stop" assembly line operation method, which not only reduced the processing circulation process and improved labor productivity, but also greatly reduced costs.

Vigorously developing the "one-stop" processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products brings many benefits to the development of production and the improvement of commune members' lives. (1) It provides abundant raw materials for industry, especially light industry and the food industry. In the past, the county construction company's plastering and coating projects were often affected because the supply of paper pulp could not keep up. Now there is a guarantee. Hygienic, packaging, and cultural paper, which were once in short supply, are now more than self-sufficient. (2) It increases national wealth and the income of communes and commune members, and improves the lives of commune members. If only a quarter of the stalks, husks, and leaves of the county's summer harvest crops are utilized, it can increase income by more than 9 million yuan. (3) It expands feed sources. The county has now stored and utilized more than 400 million catties of various types of roughage and concentrated feed processed from wheat straw, rapeseed stalks, etc., which can guarantee that 400,000 pigs can eat for two months, greatly saving land and labor for growing feed. (4) Through vigorously developing the processing and utilization of agricultural and sideline products, each commune has trained a certain number of technical workers in winemaking, papermaking, etc., and has made many commune members multi-skilled.

### 德江县大搞夏收作物秸秆综合利用  全县办小型工厂饲料加工厂近三千个  为工业提供了原料为社员增加了收入

    德江县大搞夏收作物秸秆综合利用
    全县办小型工厂饲料加工厂近三千个
    为工业提供了原料为社员增加了收入
    本报贵阳5日电　贵州省德江县充分利用小麦、油菜、蚕豆等夏收作物的秆、壳、叶，大搞综合利用和加工“一条龙”。从5月下旬开始，一个月来，全县已办起造纸、酿酒、熬糖、制碱、加工淀粉小型工厂一千二百多个，和饲料加工厂一千七百多个，生产了糖、酒、纸、碱、糕点、淀粉和饲料等产品共五百九十余万斤，价值四十五万多元。
    早在夏收刚开始时，中共德江县委就对夏收农副产品的加工和综合利用进行了研究和布置，并由县委书记和工交部长负责试验麦秆的一条龙加工和综合利用，研究出先将麦秆熬糖，将糖渣酿酒，再将酒糟造纸浆和纸的方法，这样，每百斤麦秆可制糖五斤，酿酒六斤和纸浆一百斤，总产值达四十四元。
    在县委的大力领导下，全县农副产品加工一条龙和综合利用的群众运动普遍开展。各公社生产队都抽调了一批社员从事农副产品加工。平原公社从5月中旬以来，以生产队为单位办起了农副产品加工厂三十九个，每个厂配备了三至五个工人，由生产队副队长具体领导加工，仅半个月的时间，全社就用麦秆、油菜秆制出糖八百多斤。潮底公社袁场管理区的团结、上坝、凤溪、袁场等四个生产队，就办起二十个造纸厂，每天能生产成品和半成品一万余斤。稳平公社还利用荞秆、油菜秆和豌豆壳、叶、秆等生产出土碱、淀粉、纸浆和白酒。县酿酒厂已利用农副产品酿出白酒八吨。
    为了支持农副产品加工和综合利用工作的开展，县级各部门积极帮助生产队加工厂解决资金、设备不足的困难。商业部门对各厂产品实行包销，并派出职工五十多人与各厂一齐搞试验，办起了一条龙综合加工厂八个。为了克服运输上的困难，各地一般都把工厂建立在原材料产地或交通沿线。各个县办厂、社办厂都把农副产品加工利用的各个环节，互相密切结合起来。如淀粉、制糖、酿酒、造纸、糕点等加工厂推行一条龙流水作业法后，不仅减少了加工流转过程，提高了劳动生产率，还大大降低了成本。
    大搞农副产品一条龙加工和综合利用，为发展生产和改善社员生活带来许多好处。（1）给工业，特别是轻工业和食品工业提供了丰裕的原料。县建筑公司过去因纸筋供应不上，抹灰、涂浆的工程进展常常受到影响。现在有了保证。一度供不应求的卫生、包装、文化用纸，现在做到了自给有余。（2）增加了国家财富和公社、社员的收入，改善了社员生活。全县夏收作物的秆、壳、叶，如利用四分之一，就可以增加收入九百多万元。（3）扩大饲料来源。全县现已贮藏利用麦秆、油菜秆等加工的各种粗饲料和精饲料四亿多斤，可保证四十万头生猪吃两个月，大大节约了种饲料的土地和劳力。（4）各公社通过大搞农副产品加工利用，培训出一定数量的酿酒、造纸等技术工人，并使很多社员成为多面手。
