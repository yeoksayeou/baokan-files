    "This is an order for China!"
    ——Visiting the Dimavag Machine Factory
    Hu Ruomu, Chen Xiaodong, Deligeer
    We visited the Dimavag Machine Factory in Miskolc, which is manufacturing equipment for the production of seamless steel tubes for China, and some of it has already been delivered to China. In February of this year, the factory sent three outstanding technicians to China to help with installation. In May of this year, another technician was added, along with two technicians from Budapest, to go to China. The equipment currently in production was originally scheduled for delivery in December of this year, but the workers are striving to deliver it three months ahead of schedule.
    We visited the factory's cutting and assembly workshops, where 70% to 75% of the tasks last year and this year were for production for China. We saw huge machines for manufacturing seamless steel tubes, and workers were testing their performance. There were "tube straightening machines" to smooth the tube walls, "steel tube compressors" to make the thick tube billets thinner, and "gear engines," etc. We also saw a "pre-pressing machine" being painted, which uses a new method of stretching steel tubes. Comrade Baire Esi. Fanoxi, the director of the cold processing department who accompanied us on the tour, told us that these machines would be shipped to Moscow for exhibition and then shipped to China.
    The machine manufacturing industry is the largest industrial sector in Hungary, but it only truly developed after liberation, and the speed has been rapid. The ruling class of old Hungary, in order to seize profits, had established some industries with low investment and quick profits, such as food, textiles, medicine, telecommunications, locomotives and rolling stock, and mining. However, for heavy industries that were the basis for the development of the national economy, such as metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, electric power, and chemical sectors, due to large investments and slow profits, they were not valued, so these sectors had always been weak. After liberation, the Party and the government led the people to rapidly restore industrial production that had been severely damaged by the war, and began large-scale industrial construction centered on heavy industry, achieving remarkable results. The machinery manufacturing industry developed the fastest: the total output value in 1959 increased by 3.8 times compared to 1949; the number of employees increased from 21% of the total number of industrial workers in 1938 to 30% in 1958; many new enterprises were established; many old enterprises were expanded or rebuilt; thousands of new products that could not be produced before liberation appeared, such as trucks, buses, floating cranes, new machine tools, tractors, combine harvesters, electronic and nuclear instruments, X-ray machines, etc. These products not only meet their own needs but are also exported in large quantities, many of which are very familiar to the Chinese people.
    The Dimavag Machine Factory was rebuilt on the ruins of war. It was bombed twice during World War II; when Hitler's army retreated, it looted 80% of its machinery. Therefore, when the factory was liberated in December 1944, it became a factory without machines. The workers carried out arduous labor and received assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to rebuild the factory. Now it produces equipment for manufacturing cables, various steam hammers, train wheel discs, truck kingpins, railway car springs, as well as steel rolling and seamless steel tube manufacturing equipment. It is working with the Csepel Factory and GANZ-MÁVAG factory in Budapest to produce equipment for manufacturing seamless steel tubes for China.
    The workers of the Dimavag Machine Factory are working diligently, inspired by the spirit of socialist patriotism and internationalism. Since 1948, the factory has been awarded the title of advanced factory in the metallurgical and mechanical industry department fifteen times. In the competition launched last year to welcome the Seventh National Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, it won the state's mobile red flag. Last year, it overfulfilled the annual production plan by 6.7%; overfulfilled the export plan by 14%; the original plan was to reduce costs by 8% last year, but it actually reduced them by 15%; in that year alone, it produced products worth 14 million forints (Hungarian currency) for the country beyond the plan. The Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic and the All-Hungarian Trade Union Council awarded it the Red Flag Award. The secretary of the factory's Party committee specifically told us that one of the reasons they received the Red Flag Award was that they completed the task of producing orders for China on time.
    The workers of the Dimavag Machine Factory are working with great enthusiasm for the work of ordering for China. When the task of producing for China was first accepted, the factory director and the secretary of the Party committee made special reports to the cadres, pointing out the economic and especially the political significance of this production for the people of China and Hungary. Special discussions were held on this task among the masses of workers. Engineers and workers jointly formulated plans, and in the process of formulating plans, they discussed and repeatedly studied them together. Comrade Baire Esi told us that producing a complete set of equipment is different from producing a certain product in large quantities. It not only requires skilled technology, but also requires a higher level of political consciousness. The best designers cannot foresee all the problems in the project, which requires technicians and workers to cooperate closely with a high sense of responsibility, and to discover and solve problems at any time. The factory leadership mobilized the most outstanding workers and technicians to work on the order for China. They concretely implemented the patriotism and internationalism of the working class into production. For example, when manufacturing a gear engine, there was a V-shaped part that could not be processed in the factory. What should be done? The workers worked with the technicians to study together, think of ways, and find tricks, and finally came up with a way to improve the tools and solve the problem. This not only saved two months of time, but also saved more than 200,000 forints in production costs. For another example, after a planing machine was built, its performance needed to be tested. Originally, it was necessary to dig up the ground, pour cement, and build a solid foundation before it could be carried out, but this would take a lot of time, manpower, and materials. The workers believed that it could be replaced by installing an iron frame. After repeated research and debate with the technicians, this opinion was adopted. As a result, the time was shortened by one and a half months, and 150,000 forints were saved. There are many such examples, which vividly demonstrate the great enthusiasm and creative spirit of the workers and technicians. It is precisely because of this enthusiasm and creative spirit that the completion of the Chinese order task is very good. In 1959, the plan was completed by 112%; this year, the plan will be completed three months ahead of schedule. Comrade Baire Esi. Fanoxi, the director of the cold processing department, excitedly told us: "Because we are doing a good job of completing the task, we will undertake new tasks for China in 1960-62."
    The socialist labor competition in this factory is developing very well, which is another reason why it won the Red Flag Award. In this factory, there are 152 labor teams participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," with a total of 1,542 team members, of which 14 teams have already won the title of "Socialist Labor Team," with a total of 111 team members. The competition in this factory was initiated by the Balani. Jiula labor team, and this team was the first to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Because this team belongs to the assembly workshop, the main task of this workshop is to produce Chinese orders. Many of the innovation proposals mentioned above that were implemented during production for China were mainly proposed by the Balani. Jiula labor team, the Duote. Fosefu labor team, and the Qiegeer. Moerqieke labor team. Balani. Jiula is a very honest and modest young man. When we asked how Comrade Duote. Fosefu and his team members made those important innovation proposals, he simply said: "This is due to the leadership of the Party and the administration and the help of the technicians; more importantly, it is because we all know - this is an order for China."

    “这是中国的订货！”
    ——访问第马伏格机器制造厂
    胡若木、陈晓东、德礼格尔
    我们访问了密什科尔兹的第马伏格机器制造厂，这个厂正在为中国生产制造无缝钢管的设备，一部分已经运交中国。今年2月间，这个厂派了三名优秀的技术工人到中国帮助安装。今年5月间，又加派一名技术人员，跟从布达佩斯派出的另外二名技术人员一道，到中国去。正在生产的这套设备，原定在今年12月交货，但是职工们正在为提前三个月交货而努力。
    我们参观了这个工厂的切削和装配车间，这两个车间去年和今年70％到75％的任务是为中国生产。我们看到了一台台巨大的制造无缝钢管的机器，工人们正在检验它们的性能，这里面有使管壁平滑的“平管机”，使粗的管坯变细的“钢管压缩机”，有“齿轮发动机”等。我们还看到一台正在油漆的“初压机”，它采用了新的延伸钢管的方法。陪同我们参观的冷加工部主任拜雷艾西·伐诺希同志告诉我们，这些机器将运到莫斯科展览，然后运交中国。
    机器制造业是匈牙利最大的一个工业部门，但是也不过是在解放后才真正发展起来的，速度很快。旧匈牙利的统治阶级为了攫取利润曾经建立了一些投资少、获利快的工业，例如食品、纺织、医药、电讯、机车车辆、采矿等，而对于作为发展国民经济的基础的重工业，例如冶金、机械制造、电力、化学等部门，由于投资大，获利慢，并不重视，所以这些部门一直很薄弱。解放后，党和政府领导人民一方面迅速恢复了被战争严重破坏了的工业生产，另一方面开始了以重工业为中心的大规模的工业建设，取得了显著的成绩。机械制造业的发展最快：1959年的生产总值比1949年提高了三点八倍；职工人数由1938年占产业工人总数的21％上升到1958年的30％；许多新的企业建立起来了；许多旧的企业扩建或者改建了；数以千计的解放前不能生产的新产品出现了，例如卡车、公共汽车、水上起重机、新式机床、拖拉机、联合收割机、电子和核子仪器、X光机等，这些产品不仅能满足自己的需要，而且大量出口，其中许多是中国人民所非常熟悉的。
    第马伏格机器制造厂是在战争的废墟上重新建设起来的。在第二次世界大战中，它被轰炸过两次；希特勒的军队撤退的时候，又劫走了它的80％的机器。所以，到1944年12月这个厂解放的时候，它成了一个没有机器的工厂。职工们进行了艰巨的劳动，并且得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的帮助，把工厂重新建立起来。现在它生产制造电缆的设备。各种汽锤、火车的轮盘、卡车的立轴。火车车厢的弹簧以及轧钢的和制造无缝钢管的设备等等。它正在跟布达佩斯的切佩尔工厂和根斯马伐格工厂一道为中国生产制造无缝钢管的设备。
    第马伏格机器制造厂的职工们为社会主义的爱国主义和国际主义的精神所鼓舞，辛勤地劳动着。从1948年以来，这个厂先后得到过十五次冶金机械工业部门先进工厂的称号。在去年为迎接匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次全国代表大会而展开的竞赛中，它得到了州的流动红旗。去年，它超额6.7％完成了全年生产计划；超额14％完成了出口计划；去年原计划降低成本8％，实际上降低了15％；它在去年一年，为国家超计划生产了价值一千四百万福林（匈币）的产品。匈牙利人民共和国部长会议和总工会授给了它红旗奖。厂的党委书记特别告诉我们，他们得到红旗奖的原因之一，是他们按时完成了为中国订货生产的任务。
    第马伏格机器制造厂的职工们以巨大的热情为中国的订货工作。在开始接受为中国生产的任务的时候，厂长、党委书记都向干部们作了专门的报告，指出这项生产对中匈两国人民的经济的特别是政治的意义。在职工群众中，就这项任务进行了专门的讨论。工程师们和工人们一道制订计划，在制订计划的过程中他们共同商议，反复研究。拜雷艾西同志告诉我们，生产整套的设备跟大批生产某种同一的产品不一样，不但需要熟练的技术，而且需要更高的政治觉悟。最好的设计师也不可能预见工程中所有的问题，这就需要技术人员和工人们以高度的责任心密切合作，随时发现问题和解决问题。厂的领导调集了最优秀的工人和技术人员为中国的订货工作，他们把工人阶级的爱国主义和国际主义精神，具体地贯彻到生产中去。例如，在制造齿轮发动机的时候，有一个V字型的零件，本厂无法加工，怎么办呢？工人们就跟技术人员共同研究，想办法，找窍门，终于想出了办法，改进了工具，解决了问题。这样不但节省了两个月的时间，而且节约了二十几万福林生产费用。又例如，一部推床造好后，要试验它的性能，原来需要挖开地面，浇灌水泥，建成巩固的地基才能进行，但是这样就需要花费很多的时间和人力、物力。工人们认为可以用安装一个铁架的办法来代替，经过跟技术人员反复研究、争论以后，这个意见被采纳。结果缩短了一个半月的时间，节省了十五万福林。这样的事例还很多，都生动地表现了工人和技术人员们的巨大热情和创造精神，正是由于这种热情和创造精神，中国订货任务的完成情况十分良好，1959年，完成计划112％；今年将提前三个月完成计划。冷加工部主任拜雷艾西·伐诺希同志兴奋地告诉我们：“因为我们完成任务的情况好，我们将在1960—62年，承担为中国工作的新的任务。”
    这个厂的社会主义劳动竞赛开展的很好，这是它获得红旗奖的又一个原因。在这个厂里，参加“争取社会主义劳动队称号”竞赛的劳动队有一百五十二个，队员共一千五百四十二人，其中已经获得“社会主义劳动队”称号的有十四队，队员共一百一十一人。这个厂的竞赛是由巴拉尼·久拉劳动队倡议展开，而且这个队首先获得“社会主义劳动队”称号。因为这个队是属于装配车间的，这个车间的主要任务是生产中国的订货。前面提到的为中国生产时实现的许多革新创议，主要就是巴拉尼·久拉劳动队和多特·福塞夫劳动队、切盖尔·摩尔恰克劳动队提出的。巴拉尼·久拉是一位非常诚朴、谦虚的青年，当我们问到多特·福塞夫同志和他的队员们怎样作出那些重要的革新创议的时候，他只是这样简单地说：“这是由于党和行政的领导和技术人员的帮助；更重要的是，这是由于我们大家都知道——这是中国的订货。”（附图片）
