Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: To crush the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to crush illegal suppression, and to force the dissolution of the Diet, the Japanese National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" decided today to launch the 22nd National Unified Action from today until the end of this month.

According to the action plan adopted by the "National Council" today, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) will mobilize 3,000 workers to the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo on the 18th and 19th to protest the illegal suppression of workers participating in the patriotic struggle.

The plan stipulates that on July 20th, the day the Supreme Court makes a ruling on whether the reactionary "Public Security Ordinance" complies with the Japanese Constitution, a rally with 10,000 workers will be held at Hibiya Park Plaza in Tokyo.

According to the plan, from the 20th to the 25th, government officials will go to the National Personnel Authority of the Japanese government every day to protest the illegal suppression. Government officials and public corporation workers will hold workplace rallies simultaneously throughout the country on the 22nd for this purpose.

The plan stipulates that rallies will also be held in Tokyo on the 22nd and 26th to protest illegal suppression and demand that the government guarantee workers' rights to strike, association, and collective bargaining. The rally on the 26th will be attended by 60,000 workers, making it a large-scale worker demonstration.

The "National Council" also decided to continue discussing the issue of further developing the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" so that it may be possible to announce a long-term struggle program at the end of this month.

According to news received by the "National Council" Secretariat, the people of Otaru City will hold a rally on July 21st to demand the purge of reactionary politicians from the political arena, with attendees from all over Hokkaido. On the same day, a conference of representatives from the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" in Hokkaido will also be held in Otaru City.

Approximately 500 workers from ten unions in Tokyo gathered in front of the Metropolitan Police Department today to protest the illegal suppression of workers and students participating in the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Worker representatives met with officials in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department, demanding the immediate release of the twenty-one detainees.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese Socialist Party today announced its current political policy centered on launching a struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty" and establish a democratic government.

This policy was formulated based on the current political line adopted by the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party on the 5th.

The policy points out that the current movement to deny the new "Security Treaty" is a link in the movement to abolish this treaty.

The policy stipulates that after the general election, the central goal of the Socialist Party must be to establish a democratic neutral government centered on the Socialist Party, which will take the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" as its specific political goal.

The policy states that if the Socialist Party wins the general election, it will consider three ways to establish a government: establishing a Socialist Party government; establishing a coalition government with progressive parties; and establishing a coalition government including some conservative politicians, but this government will be conditional on supporting and faithfully adhering to the four political goals of the Socialist Party. The four political goals of the Socialist Party are: not recognizing the new "Security Treaty" and crushing the Japan-U.S. military alliance; upholding democracy and rebuilding parliamentary politics; economic democratization and full implementation of the social security system; and restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty.

The policy says that when it is not possible to establish a government centered on the Socialist Party, they will consider establishing a coalition government with some conservative politicians. The policy believes that this can promote the establishment of a "relatively good" government in the conservative party's circle, force the right wing in the conservative party into isolation, and weaken the strength of the conservative party.

The policy says that when establishing a coalition government with progressive parties, they "do not regard the Japanese Communist Party as an object."

Speaking of the Socialist Party's current main struggle goals, the policy says that launching a struggle against Japanese monopoly capital, which colludes with the United States to adopt a Cold War policy and endangers the future of the Japanese nation, and forcing a change in Japan's policy is the Socialist Party's current basic struggle.

　　粉碎日美条约　抗议非法镇压　迫使解散国会
　　日本人民展开22次统一行动
　　社会党发表以展开废除新“安全条约”斗争为中心的政治方针
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：为了粉碎新日美“安全条约”、粉碎非法镇压、迫使解散国会，日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议今天决定从即日起到本月底为止展开第二十二次全国统一行动。
    根据“国民会议”今天通过的行动计划，日本工会总评议会将于18日和19日在东京分别动员三千名工人到警视厅去，抗议非法镇压参加爱国斗争的工人。
    计划规定，在7月20日最高裁判所就反动的“公安条例”是否符合日本宪法问题作出判决的日子，将在东京日比谷公园广场举行有一万名工人参加的大会。
    按照计划，从20日到25日，政府机关公务人员将每天到日本政府的人事院就非法镇压进行抗议，政府公务人员和公共企业工人为此将在22日在全国各地同时举行工作场所大会。
    计划规定，还将于22日和26日在东京举行大会，抗议非法镇压和要求政府保证工人享有罢工、团结、集体谈判的权利。26日举行的大会将有六万名工人参加，是一次声势浩大的工人大示威。
      “国民会议”还决定要继续讨论关于进一步开展反对新“安全条约”斗争的问题，以便有可能在本月底宣布长期斗争纲领。
    据“国民会议”事务局收到的消息说，小樽市人民将在7月21日举行要求从政界中肃清反动政客的大会，到会的将有来自北海道各地的人。同一天，还将在小樽市举行北海道各地区的阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议代表大会。
    东京的十个工会的大约五百名工人今天在警视厅前集会，抗议非法镇压参加反对“安全条约”斗争的工人和学生。工人代表会见了警视厅负责官员，要求立即释放二十一位被捕者。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表了以展开争取废除新“安全条约”斗争和成立民主政府为中心的当前政治方针。
    这项方针是根据社会党中央执行委员会5日通过的当前的政治路线制订的。
    方针指出，目前展开的不承认新“安全条约”运动是争取废除这项条约的运动的一个环节。
    方针规定，举行大选以后，社会党的中心目标必须是成立以社会党为中心的民主中立政府，这个政府将以争取废除新“安全条约”为具体政治目标。
    方针说，社会党如果在大选中获得胜利，将考虑三种建立政府的方法：建立社会党政府；同革新政党建立联合政府；建立包括一部分保守政党人士在内的联合政府，但这种政府以支持和忠实遵守社会党的四项政治目标为条件。社会党的四项政治目标是：不承认新“安全条约”，粉碎日美军事同盟；拥护民主和重建议会政治；经济民主化和完全实施社会保障制度；恢复日中邦交和缔结日苏和约。
    方针说，在不能建立以社会党为中心的政府时，他们考虑同一些保守政党人士建立联合政府。方针认为这样可以在保守党的圈里促使建立“比较好”的政府。迫使保守政党中的右派陷入孤立，削弱保守政党的力量。
    方针说，在同革新政党建立联合政府时，他们“不把日共作为对象”。
    方针谈到社会党目前的主要斗争目标时说，展开针对同美国勾结采取冷战政策和危害日本民族前途的日本垄断资本的斗争，迫使改变日本的政策，是社会党目前的基本斗争。
