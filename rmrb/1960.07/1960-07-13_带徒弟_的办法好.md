　　The Method of "Mentoring Apprentices" is Good
　　Yiqing
    The Party branch of an urban people's commune is the Party organization at the grassroots level in the city. The cadres working in this organization directly lead the production, life, work, and study of the commune members. Therefore, whether they work well or not has a very significant meaning for further improving, consolidating, and developing the urban people's communes.
    Now, with the development of urban people's communes, the cadres of the grassroots Party organizations of urban communes have gradually grown up. Among these cadres, many are street Party members and housewives from before the establishment of the commune. They are energetic and enthusiastic. The establishment of urban people's communes has opened up a broader world for them, and their political and ideological awareness and professional work abilities have been further improved. However, in the early days of the commune's establishment, some of them did not have many working methods or enough work experience. Some of them had not participated in or rarely participated in street work in the past, and only managed the small affairs of one family. But now? They have to manage the major affairs of thousands or tens of thousands of people, manage factories with hundreds of people, manage canteens with hundreds or thousands of people, and manage nurseries and kindergartens with dozens or hundreds of children. These organizations are not only large in scale, but also complex and diverse in content, so it is natural to encounter some temporary difficulties when working. This requires specific help from the higher-level Party organization.
    There are many ways to provide specific help. Since the establishment of urban people's communes, various places have created many effective and good experiences and methods. The method of "mentoring apprentices" by the Party Committee of the Longhai Branch of the Hongqi Commune in Zhengzhou City is one of the good methods. As the saying goes, "Seeing is believing." People can understand new things more easily by seeing them with their own eyes than by hearing about them a hundred times. Some newly trained cadres of grassroots Party organizations in urban communes do not yet understand the most basic working methods and leadership methods of the Party. In this case, if they are only told verbally how to work and how to lead, their understanding is still abstract. If, like the Party Committee of the Longhai Branch, they adopt the method of "mentoring apprentices" and labor and work with them, teaching them how to lead production and how to follow the mass line from the joint labor and work, let them hear, see, and do it themselves, then their understanding will be direct and specific. After repeated listening, watching, and doing, their understanding will become more profound and systematic each time. Then, they can draw a set of correct leadership methods and working methods based on these very rich perceptual materials.
    From the perspective of higher-level leading cadres, adopting the method of going deep into production and into reality to "mentor apprentices" can not only discover problems in production and understand the demands and opinions of the masses in a timely manner from joint labor and work, but also more specifically understand the strengths and weaknesses of lower-level leading cadres, which aspects they have more leadership experience in, and which aspects they still lack leadership experience in. This allows them to provide down-to-earth and "targeted" help based on the strengths and weaknesses of lower-level leading cadres. Such help based on reality will not be general, but will hit the nail on the head. The effect of such help will certainly be much greater than that of general help.
    Urban people's communes across the country are being further consolidated, improved, and developed. All localities should learn from the method of "mentoring apprentices" by the Party Committee of the Longhai Branch to strengthen the training and education of grassroots cadres of communes. At the same time, they should also combine the specific conditions of their respective regions to create more good experiences and methods, so that grassroots cadres of urban communes can grow up better and faster.

　　“带徒弟”的办法好
　　怡清
    城市人民公社的党支部是城市基层的党组织，在这个组织里工作的干部，直接领导公社社员的生产、生活、工作和学习。因此，他们工作得好不好，对于进一步提高、巩固和发展城市人民公社，有非常重大的意义。
    现在，随着城市人民公社的发展，城市公社基层党组织的干部已经逐渐成长起来。在这些干部中，有很多是公社成立以前的街道党员、家庭妇女。他们干劲足，热情高，城市人民公社的建立，给他们开拓了更加广阔的天地，政治思想觉悟和业务工作能力获得了进一步提高。但是，在公社成立初期，他们当中有些人工作办法还不多，工作经验还不足，其中有些人过去没有参加或很少参加街道工作，管的只是一家一户的小事，现在呢？却要管几千、几万人的大事，管几百人的工厂，管上百上千人的食堂，管几十个、几百个孩子的托儿所、幼儿园。这些组织不仅规模大，而且内容复杂、多样，工作起来自然会碰到一些暂时的困难，这就需要上级党组织予以具体帮助。
    具体帮助的办法很多，城市人民公社建立以来，各地已经创造了许多行之有效的好经验、好办法。郑州市红旗公社陇海分社党委会“带徒弟”的办法是好办法之一。俗语说：“百闻不如一见”，人们对于新鲜的东西，哪怕听一百次，也不如亲眼见一次容易领会。有些新培养出来的城市公社基层党组织的干部，对于党的最基本的工作方法、领导方法还不大懂得，在这样情况下，如果只是口头上告诉他们怎样工作，怎样领导，他们的理解还是抽象的。如果像陇海分社党委会一样，采用“带徒弟”的办法，和他们共同劳动和工作，从共同劳动和工作中，教给他们怎样领导生产？怎样走群众路线？让他们亲耳听，亲眼看，亲手做，这样，他们的理解就是直接的、具体的。经过反复多次的听、看、做，一次比一次理解得更加深刻，更加系统，然后就可以根据这些十分丰富的感性材料，得出一套正确的领导方法和工作方法来。
    从上级领导干部来说，采取深入生产、深入实际
  “带徒弟”的办法，不仅可以从共同劳动和工作中，及时发现生产中的问题，了解群众的要求和意见，还可以更加具体地了解下级领导干部究竟有哪些长处？哪些短处？哪方面领导经验多些？哪方面领导经验还不足？这就可以针对下级领导干部的优点和弱点，踏踏实实地、“有的放矢”地进行帮助。这样从实际出发的帮助就不会是一般化的，而是切中要害的。这样的帮助效果一定比一般的帮助效果大得多。
    全国各地城市人民公社正在进一步巩固、提高、发展，各地应当学习陇海分社党委会“带徒弟”的办法，加强对于公社基层干部的培养、教育工作。同时还应结合各该地区的具体情况，创造出更多的好经验、好办法，使城市公社基层干部更好、更快地成长起来。
