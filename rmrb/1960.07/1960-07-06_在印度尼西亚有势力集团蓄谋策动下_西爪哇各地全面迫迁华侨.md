Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 5th dispatch: While the West Java military authorities were creating the Zima Market massacre of overseas Chinese, under the premeditated instigation of influential groups in Indonesia, the comprehensive eviction of overseas Chinese in various parts of West Java has further intensified.

Under the instructions of their superiors, the Cirebon military authorities recently ordered local overseas Chinese to leave their long-term residences, where they had contributed to the Indonesian economy, before June 27. In the Galang Private Estate and Cibinong areas of this region, eight households comprising twenty-four people have already been forced to relocate. The Cirebon tax authorities are also intensifying their persecution of overseas Chinese, ordering them to pay "taxes" dating back to 1957. More than twenty overseas Chinese families, including Chen Wensai and Ye Youhong, were summoned and intimidated by the authorities for being unable to pay these unreasonably and forcibly added taxes. The authorities also sealed and froze the property in these overseas Chinese homes, prohibiting them from selling, taking away, or giving it to others, and threatened that if they did not pay the taxes as required, the property would be sold off.

In Majalaya, the West Java military authorities dispatched a large number of troops, including about twenty-five soldiers and ten armed police, on the morning of June 30 to carry out armed evictions, ordering overseas Chinese to immediately move their belongings onto trucks.

At the same time, the Bogor City Housing Committee is also arbitrarily forcing local overseas Chinese to relocate. On June 20, the director of the Housing Committee, Syarief Suryanadarmaja, along with representatives from the City Hall and the Procuratorate, and six soldiers, went to the home of Xie Mishen at 3 Bangaru, Bogor, and arbitrarily forced them to relocate, ordering them to vacate their residence and shop within ten days and move to a designated location. Syarief Suryanadarmaja also threatened, "If you do not move voluntarily, I will use my power to force you to move." Xie Mishen repeatedly reasoned with them, but the authorities could not explain this unreasonable act of occupation. On June 28, Syarief Suryanadarmaja issued another written order forcing Xie Mishen to relocate.

The broad masses of overseas Chinese in Indonesia are watching with indignation and unease the increasingly rampant and comprehensive anti-Chinese activities instigated by influential groups in West Java, and demand that the Indonesian authorities abide by their promise not to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese and immediately stop the forced relocation.

    在印度尼西亚有势力集团蓄谋策动下
    西爪哇各地全面迫迁华侨
    新华社5日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚有势力集团的蓄谋策动下，西爪哇军事当局在芝马圩制造屠杀华侨惨案的同时，西爪哇各地掀起的全面迫迁华侨的活动已进一步加剧。
    井里汶军事当局最近在其上级指示下，勒令当地华侨在6月27日前离开他们长期居住并对印度尼西亚经济作出贡献的原居留地。在这个地区的加郎私翁和芝彬洛两地已有八户二十四人被迫迁移。井里汶税务当局也对华侨加紧迫害，勒令他们缴清1957年以来的“税款”。华侨陈文赛、叶友鸿等二十多家因无能力缴清这种无理强行追加的税款而遭当局传讯恐吓。当局还把这些华侨的家中财物标封冻结，禁止出售、带走或赠送别人，并威胁说，如没有按照他们的要求缴税的话，将把那些财物变卖。
    在马者拉夜，西爪哇军事当局在6月30日清晨出动了包括约二十五名军人、十名武装警察的大批军队到那里去进行武装迫迁，命令华侨立即把东西搬到卡车上去。
    同时，茂物市房屋委员会也蛮横地强迫当地华侨迁移。6月20日，房屋委员会主任夏利苏亚那达米哈渣、以及市政厅和检察署的代表和士兵等共六人到茂物邦加路三号谢弥慎家中，蛮横地强迫他们迁移，勒令在十天内把住宅和店铺腾空，迁到指定地点去。夏利苏亚那达米哈渣还威胁说，“如果不自动搬迁，我将使用我的权力强迫你搬”。谢弥慎曾多次据理进行交涉，当局对这种无理霸占的行为也无法解释。6月28日，夏利苏亚那达米哈渣又下书面命令强迫谢弥慎迁移。
    印度尼西亚广大华侨都怀着愤慨和不安的心情，密切注视印度尼西亚有势力集团在西爪哇策动的这种变本加厉的、全面的排华活动，并且要求印度尼西亚当局遵守它的不再迫迁华侨的诺言，立即停止迫迁。
