    The Cuban People's Struggle on the Food Front
    Li Ni
    We visited many towns and villages in Cuba. Here, the land is fertile, the pastures vast, and the sugarcane fields dense. Everywhere, you can see layers upon layers of coconut groves, palm groves, and countless flowers and trees of unknown names. Mangoes, oranges, and bananas, laden with fruit, fill the valleys large and small. The underground holds rich mineral deposits, waiting to be explored and exploited. There is no winter here, and it is evergreen all year round. People call Cuba the "Green Island" and "Pearl" of the Caribbean, which aptly illustrates how rich, beautiful, and lovely Cuba is!
    However, such a beautiful place, before the revolution, encountered a very unfortunate fate. In the countryside, hundreds of thousands of peasants lost their land, and large tracts of fertile land were plundered by foreign trusts and domestic landlords. American monopoly capitalists occupied 25% of Cuba's cultivated land. However, they did not grow grain on these lands, but mainly planted sugarcane, turning Cuba into a country with a single economy, in order to facilitate their political control and economic plunder, and to force this country suitable for agricultural production to import grain from the United States every year, even vegetables.
    The leader in charge of financial planning in Camagüey Province told us: The dictatorial government before the revolution, in order to succumb to and serve American imperialism, imported 40 million US dollars worth of rice from the United States every year, accounting for 80% of Cuba's food supply. At that time, if the United States did not sell grain, 90% of the population of Cuba would have starved. This was the misfortune and shame that Batista brought to the Cuban people.
    After the victory of the revolution, the Cuban government implemented land reform nationwide. Under the leadership of the National Land Reform Committee, the broad masses of peasants requisitioned and took over the land of American companies and domestic large landlords, and established agricultural cooperatives on these estates. As a result, the face of the Cuban countryside was completely renewed, and the peasants were freed from the shackles of semi-feudal land relations, became masters of their own land, and increased their labor enthusiasm and labor productivity. José Tarimchi, the director of the Agramante Cooperative in Camagüey Province, told us: Before the revolution, farmers had no houses to live in, no electric lights, and only earned 1.6 pesos (Cuban currency, equivalent to the US dollar) for working ten hours a day. The whole family lacked food and clothing, and life was very difficult. After the establishment of the cooperative, the cooperative built new houses for the members, had electric lights, worked eight hours a day, and earned 2.75 pesos. At the end of the year, they could also share bonuses. In addition, the cooperative also has clinics and schools, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation are more convenient. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the members is very high, and production increases season by season. This cooperative has 1,300 caballerías of land (one caballería is equal to 201.45 Chinese mu), half of which are pastures and wastelands. The original cultivated land was only 180 caballerías. Since the establishment of the cooperative, in less than a year, the cultivated area has nearly doubled, and many wastelands have been reclaimed. This spring, rice alone was planted on 427 caballerías, and sugarcane, corn, and potatoes were also planted. Last year's production increased by 30% compared with before the land reform, and production will continue to increase this year. The task assigned to this cooperative by the National Land Reform Committee is mainly to grow rice and sugarcane. The director said proudly: "We must produce a large amount of food, so that the people of the motherland can eat domestically produced rice, which is both cheap and delicious!" This sentence is full of hatred and contempt for American imperialism.
    We visited six provinces and many cooperatives. On the production front, each province is developing different crops according to local conditions, but there is a common phenomenon. In addition to sugarcane, rice, corn, peanuts, and potatoes are generally grown. Many farmers pointed to the seedlings in the fields and told us: "Cuba not only produces sugarcane, but also will have a surplus of grain!" This is the voice of 1.5 million Cuban farmers. They are full of confidence in victory in producing more grain.
    In order to change the single-crop system and realize the ideal of self-sufficiency in grain that has not been achieved for many years, the Cuban government is vigorously developing the diversified production of agriculture and has taken a series of positive measures. The Cuban government has decided to first establish a large-scale joint rice planting center in Cenaga, on the south coast of Las Villas Province in central Cuba. This is a swampy area with a warm climate, fertile soil, and abundant water. Two crops of rice can be harvested here every year. Tens of thousands of caballerías of rice fields will appear here.
    The National Land Reform Committee is very concerned about leading agricultural production and has a special organization to guide production, attaches importance to the rotation of various crops by cooperatives according to local conditions, and develops two-season crops (such as rice) and three-season crops; expands the cultivated area where conditions permit, and strengthens field management, etc.
    More importantly, we have seen that after the establishment of cooperatives, the broad masses of farmers have an unprecedented attitude of being masters of their own affairs and vigorous production enthusiasm. The broad masses of members are workers, farmers, and soldiers (cooperatives have militia organizations, and there are already more than 100,000 militias in Cuba, and they are still continuing to develop). They are all organized, producing while training; they deeply know that the more grain they produce, the heavier the blow to American imperialism.
    Cuba is also trying to grow wheat. Regarding the planting of wheat, some people raised objections: One saying is that Cuba's soil is not suitable for planting wheat, and even if it is planted, seedlings will not grow; another saying is that Cuba's climate is too hot, and the wheat seedlings will wither after they come out of the soil. Most people refuted these two sayings, believing that these fallacies came from the mouths of Americans and importers, who spread these words for ulterior motives, that is, "not to let Cuba produce grain, but only to let Cuba be the sugar bowl of the Americans." We encountered many more responsible people who believed that Cuba could grow wheat and advocated immediately conducting wheat cultivation experiments to refute the fallacies with facts. When we visited Santa Clara, we happened to meet a provincial leader who talked excitedly about the wheat growing. He said that the land in Las Villas Province is not only suitable for growing rice, but also suitable for growing wheat. As early as more than 100 years ago, Spaniards planted a large amount of wheat in this province, and there were more types of wheat than in Spain, and there were bumper harvests year after year; the wheat harvested not only supplied the province, but also supplied other provinces in Cuba. The Cuban government has instructed Las Villas Province to establish a wheat planting experimental farm. This experiment is about to begin. If the experiment is successful, the Cuban people will eat flour milled from domestic wheat. How exciting this is for the Cuban people.
    Cuban farmers have achieved initial success in striving for self-sufficiency in grain. According to official statistics, the total output value of rice produced in 1959 reached 35 million pesos, which is not much different from the total expenditure on rice imports. Raúl Castro, the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister, told us: "Cuba's food problem will be completely self-sufficient next year, and we will no longer import a single grain from the United States in the future!" This sentence encourages thousands of farmers to step up production, rely on their own efforts, and build a prosperous and affluent new motherland!

    古巴人民在粮食战线上的斗争
    李尼
    我们在古巴访问了许多城镇和乡村。这里有肥沃的土地；广阔的牧场；茂密的甘蔗田。到处都可以见到密密层层的椰子林、棕榈林和不知名的花草树木。硕果满枝的芒果、桔子和香蕉，布满了大小山谷。地下蕴藏着丰富的矿藏，正等待人们去钻探开采。这里没有冬天，四季常青。人们把古巴叫做加勒比海上的“绿岛”和“珍珠”，这就恰好说明了景色如画的古巴，是多么富饶、美丽和可爱！
    但是，这样美好的地方，在革命胜利前，却遭遇着非常不幸的命运。在农村，成千上万的农民失去了土地，大块肥沃的土地被外国托辣斯和本国庄园主掠夺了去。美国垄断资本家霸占了古巴耕种面积的25％的土地。可是，他们在这些土地上并不耕种粮米，而主要种植甘蔗，把古巴变成一个单一经济的国家，以便于它政治控制和经济掠夺，并使这个适于农业生产的古巴，每年要从美国进口粮食，甚至连蔬菜也要从美国进口。
    卡马圭省管理财务计划的领导人对我们说：革命前的独裁政府，为了屈从和效劳美帝国主义，每年要从美国进口四千万美元的大米，占全古巴的食粮80％，那时如果美国不卖给粮食，全古巴90％的人口都将要饿肚子，这是巴蒂斯塔给古巴人民带来的不幸和耻辱。
    革命胜利后，古巴政府在全国范围内实行了土地改革。广大农民在土地改革全国委员会的领导下，征用并接管了美国公司和本国大庄园主的土地，并在这些庄园上成立了农业合作社。于是，古巴农村的面貌焕然一新，农民从此摆脱了半封建土地关系的束缚，成为自己土地的主人，提高了劳动热情和劳动生产率。卡马圭省阿格拉曼德合作社社长何斯塔瑞姆奇对我们说：革命前，农民没有房子住，没有电灯，每天劳动十小时，才得工资一点六比索（古巴货币，与美元等值），全家老小缺少衣食，生活过得很苦。成立了合作社以后，社里给社员们盖上了新房，有了电灯，每天劳动八小时，得工资二点七五比索，到了年终还可以分到红利。此外社里还有医务所和学校，衣、食、住、行都较方便。因此社员们的生产热情很高，一季比一季增产。这个合作社有土地一千三百卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二零一点四五中国亩），有一半是牧场和荒地，原有耕地仅有一百八十卡瓦耶里亚，成立合作社以来，不到一年的时间里，耕地面积扩大到将近一倍，还开垦了许多荒地，今年春季只是稻子一项就种上了四百二十七卡瓦耶里亚，其他还种了甘蔗、玉米和土豆。去年的生产就比土改前增产了30％，今年将继续增加产量。土地改革全国委员会给这个合作社的任务主要是种稻子和甘蔗。社长很自豪地说：“我们要大量地生产粮食，要叫祖国的人民吃到国产的大米，又便宜，又好吃！”这句话充满着对美帝国主义的愤恨和蔑视。
    我们先后访问了六个省份，参观了许多个合作社。在生产战线上各省因地制宜，大力发展着不同的作物，但有一个共同的现象，除了甘蔗外，普遍的多种了稻子、玉米、花生和土豆。许多农民指着田里的苗儿对我们讲：“古巴不但出甘蔗，而且将有余粮！” 这是古巴一百五十万农民的声音，他们对于多打粮食充满着胜利的信心。
    为了改变单一作物制，实现多年来未能达到粮食自给的理想，古巴政府大力发展农业的多种生产，并且采取了一系列积极的措施。古巴政府已决定在古巴的中部拉斯维利亚斯省的南面沿海地区先拿加建立一个规模宏大的联合种稻中心。这是一片沼泽地带，气候温暖，土壤肥沃，水量充足，每年可收获两季稻米。这里将要出现几万卡瓦耶里亚的稻田。
    土地改革全国委员会非常关心领导农业生产，并设有专门的指导生产的机构，重视各合作社因地制宜轮种各种作物，并发展两季作物（如稻米）和三季作物；有条件的扩大耕种面积，加强田间管理等等。
    更重要的是，我们看到了广大的农民，成立了合作社以后，那种主人翁的姿态和蓬勃的生产热情，在古巴是史无前例的。广大的社员是工、是农也是兵（合作社都有民兵组织，全古巴已有民兵十余万，仍在继续发展中），他们都组织起来了，一面生产，一面练兵；他们深深地知道生产的粮食越多，给美帝国主义的打击也就越沉重。
    古巴还正在试种小麦。关于种小麦，有人提出反对意见：有一种说法认为古巴的土壤不适合种小麦，就是种上也长不出苗来；另一种说法认为古巴的气候太热，麦苗出了土就都枯死了。大多数的人反驳了这两种说法，认为这些谬论是出自美国人和进口商之口，他们散布这些话，是为了不能告人的目的，那就是“不让古巴生产粮食，只让古巴做美国人的糖罐子”。我们碰到许多比较负责的人，都认为古巴可以种小麦并且主张立即进行小麦耕作试验，用事实来驳倒谬论。我们在汕大格拉尔访问时，偶然碰到了一位省里的领导人，他兴高彩烈地谈到关于种小麦的事。他说，拉斯维利亚斯省的土地，不但适合种稻子，而且也适合种小麦。远在一百多年以前，西班牙人就在这个省里种了大量的小麦，麦子的种类比西班牙还多，而且连年都是丰收的；所收获的小麦不但供给了本省，而且也供应古巴其他各省。古巴政府已经指示拉斯维利亚斯省设立小麦种植试验场。这个试验即将开始。如果试验成功，古巴人民将吃到用国产小麦磨成的面粉了。这对古巴人民来说，是多么兴奋的事情呵。
    古巴农民在力争粮食自给方面，已经取得了初步成就。据官方统计，1959年生产的稻米总产值已达三千五百万比索，距离大米进口的总支出额相差无几了。古巴革命武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗少校告诉我们说：“古巴的粮食问题，明年就要全部自给了，今后可以不再进口美国一粒粮！”这句话鼓舞着千万个农民加紧生产，自力更生，建立繁荣富足的新祖国！
