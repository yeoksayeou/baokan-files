Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch - Under the direction of influential groups in Indonesia, the West Java military authorities, starting from late May, have initiated the second large-scale forced relocation and anti-Chinese activities against Overseas Chinese, faithlessly abandoning the promise made by the Indonesian government that it would no longer forcibly relocate Overseas Chinese. Currently, the West Java military authorities are intensifying the use of various crude means to coerce Overseas Chinese to relocate.

Recently, the military police outposts in the Cimao area, where the West Java military authorities are forcing Overseas Chinese to relocate, have suddenly increased, and the atmosphere is very tense. The Indonesian army began forcibly relocating local Overseas Chinese on June 23. On the same day, two Overseas Chinese were arrested and interrogated and intimidated by the military. Soldiers holding wooden sticks and fully armed police continued to Cimao on the 24th to force Overseas Chinese to relocate. The military also unreasonably cut off the power supply to the families of Overseas Chinese who had been ordered to relocate. Prior to this, groups of soldiers and military police holding wooden sticks also went door-to-door to the homes of Overseas Chinese in Cimao and Majalaya to intimidate them, forcing Overseas Chinese to fill out forms to "voluntarily relocate" within a specified date. The form also included a guarantee that if they failed to move by the deadline, they would be subject to legal punishment. The local military authorities also continued to summon Overseas Chinese who were ordered to be forcibly relocated, even threatening to "create bloodshed" in order to force Overseas Chinese to relocate.

In Ujungberung, West Java, ninety-two Overseas Chinese have already been forcibly transported to Bandung by the military in trucks.

At the same time, personnel and cars from the US Embassy have also become active in the relocation areas of West Java.

On the morning of June 24, Lieutenant Colonel Sadari, the wartime authority of West Priangan, went to Cimao in a US Embassy car (license plate number CD62), accompanied by US personnel. At 5 pm on the 24th, another US Embassy car arrived in Bandung.

According to foreign reports, the Indonesian Supreme War Authority held a national conference on May 30 and 31. According to a very brief communique issued after the meeting, Minister of National Security Nasution, when talking about the issues that the Indonesian government should pay attention to in the future, emphasized the need to "supervise" foreign residents. Nasution also stressed that people from all walks of life should help implement "Presidential Decree No. 10 prohibiting foreign small traders."

At the same time, on May 31, Kosasih, commander of the 6th Military District of West Java, issued an order, ordering foreign residents living in Majalaya, Matalara, Ujungberung, Cimao and Lembang to move out of the area within a limited time. Subsequently, Sadari, the wartime authority of West Priangan, and the military authorities of Bandung Regency also issued orders related to the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese.

Captain Maji, a staff member of the West Priangan wartime authority who returned from "studying" in the United States last year and who had previously massacred a large number of Overseas Chinese in the 1948 "Mojokerto Incident," has been very active in threatening to use "tough actions" to implement forced relocation of Overseas Chinese. On June 17, when he spoke at a meeting convened by the relevant authorities in Cimao for Overseas Chinese, he said that Overseas Chinese must move out of the area on time, otherwise, tough actions would be taken. During this period, he also threatened to take "tough actions" when individually summoning Overseas Chinese.

While the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in West Java is intensifying, the auxiliary body of the Indonesian Supreme War Authority held a meeting on June 21, which the Indonesian news agency reported as "seemingly held in secret." Participants included First Minister Djuanda, Minister of National Security Nasution, and Foreign Minister Subandrio. After this meeting, the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese not only did not stop but became even more intensified.

People cannot but notice that although the Indonesian Foreign Minister recently made a promise on behalf of the Indonesian government that it would no longer forcibly relocate Overseas Chinese, large-scale forced relocation and anti-Chinese activities have recently occurred in West Java. This two-faced approach of paying lip service to friendship while indulging in anti-Chinese activities is being used by influential groups to undermine the friendly relations between Indonesia and China, thereby achieving dangerous goals.

### 印度尼西亚有势力集团口上空谈友好实际放任排华  西爪哇当局再次粗暴迫迁华侨

    印度尼西亚有势力集团口上空谈友好实际放任排华
    西爪哇当局再次粗暴迫迁华侨
    军方无理逮捕和审讯华侨　甚至公然威胁说不惜“制造流血事件”
    美使馆人员加紧活动　“茉莉芬事件”中屠杀华侨的凶手又形活跃
    新华社30日讯　在印度尼西亚有势力集团指使下，西爪哇军事当局从5月下旬起开始了对华侨的第二次大规模迫迁和排华活动，毫无信义地背弃了印度尼西亚政府所作过的不再强迫华侨迁移的诺言。目前，西爪哇军事当局正加紧使用各种粗暴的手段胁迫华侨迁移。
    近日来，西爪哇军事当局强迫华侨迁移的芝马圩地区，突然增加了军警岗哨，气氛十分紧张。印度尼西亚军队6月23日开始用武力强迫当地华侨迁移。当天有两名华侨被逮捕，遭到军部的审讯和恐吓。手持木棍的军人和全副武装的警察，24日继续到芝马圩强迫华侨迁移。军方并毫无道理地断绝了被勒令迁移的华侨家庭的电源供应。在此以前，成批的手持木棍的军人和宪兵还挨户到芝马圩、马者拉夜华侨家中进行恐吓，强迫华侨填写在指定日期内“自愿搬迁”的表格。表格上并附有如到期不搬、愿受法律处分的保证。当地军事当局还继续不断传讯被勒令迫迁的华侨，甚至威胁说，为了强迫华侨迁移将不惜“制造流血事件”。
    在西爪哇的乌绒不龙，已经有九十二名华侨被军方用卡车强行运往万隆。
  与此同时，美国大使馆人员和汽车也在西爪哇迫迁地区活跃起来。
  6月24日上午，西勃良安州战时掌权者沙达里中校乘一辆美国大使馆的汽车（车牌C D62号）到芝马圩活动，同车还有美国人员。24日下午五时又有另一辆美国大使馆的汽车到达万隆。
    据外电报道，在5月30日和31日，印度尼西亚最高战时掌权部举行了一次全国会议。据会后发表的一份非常简略的公报透露，国家安全部长纳苏蒂安在谈到印度尼西亚政府将来应当注意的问题时，强调要“监督”外国居民。纳苏蒂安还着重指出，各界人士应当帮助执行“禁止外国小商贩的总统第十号法令”。
    同时，在5月31日，西爪哇第六军区司令科沙西颁发命令，勒令居住在马者拉夜、马打拉零、乌绒不龙、芝马圩和连旺等地的外侨限期迁离当地。其后，西勃良安州战时掌权者沙达里和万隆县军事当局先后也发布了有关迫迁华侨的命令。
    去年从美国“学习”回来的、过去曾经在1948年的“茉莉芬事件”中屠杀大量华侨的西勃良安州战时掌权部人员马吉上尉在威胁使用“强硬行动”来对华侨实施迫迁这一方面很活跃。6月17日他在芝马圩有关当局召集华侨参加的一次会议上演说时说，华侨必须按期搬离当地，否则要采取强硬行动。在这一期间，他还曾在个别传讯华侨的时候，威胁要采取“强硬行动”。
    而正在西爪哇对华侨施行迫迁的活动正在日趋加紧的时候，印度尼西亚最高战时掌权部辅助机构在6月21日举行了据印度尼西亚新闻社报道说是“看来似乎是秘密举行”的会议。参加会议的有第一部长朱安达、国家安全部长纳苏蒂安和外交部长苏班德里约。此次会后，迫迁华侨的行动不但没有停止，而且反而变本加厉了。
    人们不能不注意到，尽管印度尼西亚外交部长不久以前代表印度尼西亚政府作了不再强迫华侨迁移的诺言，最近在西爪哇仍然发生了大规模迫迁和排华活动，这种一面空谈友好，一面放任反华排华的两面手法，正被有势力集团利用来破坏印度尼西亚和中国之间的友好关系，从而达到危险的目的。
