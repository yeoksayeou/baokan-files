Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Overseas Chinese who have returned to China in Nanjing, Nanchang, Xining and other places have recently held gatherings to strongly protest against the killing of Overseas Chinese women by the West Java military authorities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia.

On the morning of July 7th, Returned Overseas Chinese in Nanjing held a protest meeting. Zhang Chenhuan, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, pointed out at the meeting that the massacre of Overseas Chinese in Chima圩 was deliberately created by powerful groups in Indonesia. He expressed, on behalf of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, complete support and firm backing for Ambassador Huang Zhen's serious protest to the Indonesian government regarding this incident. He firmly demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the forced relocation, punish the murderers, provide compensation to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested Overseas Chinese, ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future, and issue a public apology. Yu Yingda, an Overseas Chinese student from Nanjing No. 1 Middle School who recently returned from Bandung, Indonesia, said: "In Bandung, the authorities ordered the closure of a large number of Overseas Chinese schools, and more than 2,000 Overseas Chinese students in my school alone suffered the pain of being out of school." Many Returned Overseas Chinese students spoke at the meeting, listing various facts of the close relationship between the Indonesian people and the local Overseas Chinese, and pointed out that the anti-China activities of powerful groups in Indonesia are completely contrary to the interests of the Indonesian people, and their conspiracy to poison the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian people will surely fail.

Han Feifeng, Vice Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and members of the Federation, Tang Deyuan, Gan Chengbin, Lin Caicheng, and Mo Luoping also spoke at the Nanjing Municipal Overseas Chinese gathering. They expressed their determination to transform grief and indignation into strength, do a good job in their respective positions, and strive to study hard, so as to make greater contributions to accelerating the socialist construction of the motherland.

At the protest meeting held by the Nanchang Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese on the 7th, Lin Xinquan, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, the West Java military authorities brutally killed Overseas Chinese women. All Returned Overseas Chinese in Nanchang expressed their infinite anger at this and firmly supported Ambassador Huang Zhen's serious protest to the Indonesian government regarding this incident. Huang Ruiquan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, pointed out in his speech that the crime of shooting Overseas Chinese women in Chima圩 cannot be denied. We resolutely demand that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers and stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese. Zhang Fan, a member of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that today we have a strong socialist motherland to protect us, and Overseas Chinese are no longer orphans. The anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese conspiracy activities of powerful groups in Indonesia will never succeed. Chen Qiaoping, an Indonesian Returned Overseas Chinese and student of Jiangxi Normal College, and Zhong Qinghua, a student of Jiangxi Medical College, both pointed out in their speeches that Overseas Chinese now have a great socialist motherland as their backing. No one should dream of harming or bullying us casually as they did in the past. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we Returned Overseas Chinese must study hard, work hard, and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland.

Representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese workers and students in the Xining area, recently also held a protest meeting. Jiang Ruxia and Zhao Huiling, representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese students from Qinghai University of Finance and Economics, unanimously pointed out in their speeches that in order to force Overseas Chinese to relocate, powerful groups in Indonesia did not hesitate to instigate the West Java military authorities to create bloodshed incidents. Corpses can be snatched away, blood stains can be washed away, but the crimes of the murderers are absolutely undeniable in front of the people of the world.

Zheng Nansheng, a Returned Overseas Chinese teacher from Qinghai Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College, said at the meeting that the anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia are an attempt to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, and this conspiracy will surely fail. The Indonesian people have brotherly feelings with the Overseas Chinese. Wu Zhuling, a Returned Overseas Chinese student from Qinghai Medical College, representing all the Returned Overseas Chinese teachers and students of the Medical College, firmly demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers and immediately stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese.
