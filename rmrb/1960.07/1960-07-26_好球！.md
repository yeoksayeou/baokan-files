    "Good Shot!"
    When a basketball player skillfully shoots the ball into the net, it often earns thunderous cheers from the audience: "Good shot!"
    In fact, this "Good shot!" should not only be attributed to the skilled athlete but also to the skilled ball-making workers.
    The Tianjin Lisheng Sporting Goods Factory is a well-known factory for manufacturing good balls. Many of the basketballs, footballs, and volleyballs used in last year's National Games were produced by them. These balls—especially the basketballs—are sturdy and durable, round and shiny, and enjoy a high reputation both at home and abroad.
    In this factory, in addition to having a professional quality inspection section, each team is also equipped with quality inspectors to control the quality of each process. Therefore, the factory's product qualification rate has reached over 99.5% every month since the beginning of this year, exceeding the 99% quality target.
    The workers also combine actively improving product quality with doing everything possible to save raw materials and use leftover materials and waste materials. In the past, each piece of cowhide could only be used to cut out four ball skins. After finding ways to utilize the edge skins and front shoulder skins, they can now make seven balls. In the past, thick cowhide could only be shaved to remove the inner skin, and the outer skin was used to make the ball, often resulting in uneven thickness. Now, a splitting machine is used to split the thick skin into two uniform layers, and the inner skin can be used to make thinner volleyballs or solid balls for athletes to practice with. In this way, even though a lot of edge skin and substandard skin are used, the quality standards are still maintained. (New)

### “好球！”

    “好球！”
    当一个篮球运动员，得心应手地把球投篮进网的时候，往往博得观众一阵雷鸣地欢呼：“好球！”
    其实，这个“好球！”，不仅应该归功于球技娴熟的运动员，也应该归功于手艺高巧的制球工人。
    天津市利生体育用品厂就是一个著名的制造好球的工厂。去年全国运动会篮、足、排球比赛中用的球，很多是他们生产的。这些球——特别是篮球，坚固耐磨，既圆又光，在国内外都很有声望。
    在这个厂里，现在除了设有专业的质量检验股以外，每个小组也都设有质量检验员，把住每个工序的质量关。因此，这个厂产品的正品率，今年以来月月达到99.5％以上，超过了99％的质量指标。
    工人们还把积极提高产品质量和千方百计节约原材料、使用边料废料结合起来。过去每张牛皮只能划出四个球皮，经过设法利用边皮、前肩皮以后，能够做七个球。过去厚牛皮只能用刨刀把里皮刨掉，用外皮制球，往往刨得厚薄不匀。现在使用片皮机把厚皮片成均匀的两层，里皮就能用来制较薄的排球或运动员练习用的实心球。这样，尽管使用了很多边皮次皮，仍然保持了质量标准。　　　（新）
