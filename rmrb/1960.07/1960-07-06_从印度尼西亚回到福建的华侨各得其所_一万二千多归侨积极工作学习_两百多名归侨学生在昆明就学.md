    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 5th: Over 12,000 returned overseas Chinese who came back to Fujian Province from Indonesia in the first half of this year have been properly settled by the government and are happily and actively participating in socialist construction or studying.

    Returned overseas Chinese who have been placed in overseas Chinese farms or factories and enterprises are actively participating in labor as soon as they take up their production posts. Some returned overseas Chinese who have experience in planting subtropical and tropical crops are also enthusiastically contributing their technical knowledge. Zhang Dexiang, a returned overseas Chinese who has been planting subtropical crops for more than 40 years, went to Shuangyang Farm in Jinjiang and, together with Tan Chouxi, Wu Zhengfang, Ka Renli and others who returned with him, searched the mountains around the farm for places suitable for planting pepper and other crops. The pepper planted by the farm based on their experience has a very high survival rate. Wang Donghai, a returned overseas Chinese who settled in Changshan Farm in Yunxiao, was a small vendor in Indonesia and had never worked in the fields. With the help of the old farm workers, he has now learned a lot of production techniques. Yan Songqing, who works at the Zhangzhou Automobile Maintenance and Repair Factory, modified the transfer cases of ten trucks under the guidance of veteran workers within a week, increasing the load of each vehicle from four tons to sixteen tons.

    Returned overseas Chinese students are also making rapid progress in their studies with the enthusiastic help of teachers and classmates. More than 3,000 returned overseas Chinese students at the Jimei Overseas Chinese Middle School Remedial School are reviewing according to the general review plan formulated by the school for them, and have generally made progress. Pan Zongqin, a junior high school student, had difficulty in learning at the beginning, but with the patient guidance of the teachers and the enthusiastic help of the students, his grades improved day by day. In a unit test, he scored 92 and 98 points in Chinese and Chemistry respectively.

    The lives of the returned overseas Chinese are rich and colorful. They often do radio exercises, learn to sing, and on holidays, they either hold various ball games or hold parties or watch movies. They said that in the past, they were worried about food and clothing every day when they were abroad, but now everything is satisfactory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 5th: More than 290 returned overseas Chinese students who arrived in Kunming in late June have all been properly settled and have begun a happy study life.

    Among these two groups of returned overseas Chinese students, in addition to five students with expertise in arts and sports who were recommended to study at Yunnan Academy of Arts and Yunnan Institute of Physical Education respectively, the remaining more than 200 students were assigned to study at the Middle School attached to Kunming Institute of Technology and Kunming No. 4, No. 15, and No. 14 Middle Schools. They are very grateful for the proper arrangements made by the motherland. Some students wrote big-character posters expressing their determination to strive to become a three-good student in order to repay the motherland's meticulous care.

    从印度尼西亚回到福建的华侨各得其所
    一万二千多归侨积极工作学习
    两百多名归侨学生在昆明就学
    新华社福州5日电　今年上半年先后由印度尼西亚回到福建省的一万二千多名归国华侨，在政府妥善安置下各得其所，正在愉快地积极地参加社会主义建设或学习。
    被安置在华侨农场或工厂企业的归国华侨们，许多人一走上生产岗位就积极参加劳动。有些具有种植亚热带、热带作物经验的归国侨胞，还热情地贡献他们的技术知识。种了四十多年亚热带作物的归侨张德祥，到晋江双阳农场后，和同他一起回国的谭酬喜、吴正芳、卡仁礼等人跑遍农场周围山区，寻找适合种植胡椒等作物的地方。农场根据他们的经验种植的胡椒，成活率很高。到云霄常山农场安家的归侨王东海，在印度尼西亚时是一个小贩，从未下过田。他在老场员的帮助下，现在已经学会了很多生产技术。到漳州汽车保养修配厂工作的严松清，在老工人指导下，在一个星期中改造了十辆载重汽车的加力箱，使每辆车的载重由原来四吨提高到十六吨。
    归国华侨学生在教师和同学们的热情帮助下，学习进步也很快。在集美归国华侨中等补习学校的三千多名归国华侨学生，根据学校给他们制定的总复习计划进行复习，普遍有了进步。初三学生潘宗琴开始时学习比较吃力，但是经过教师的耐心辅导和同学的热情帮助，成绩天天向上，在一次单元考试中，语文和化学两科分别得到九十二分和九十八分。
    归国侨胞们的生活丰富多彩。他们经常作广播体操，学习唱歌，逢到假日，不是举行各类球赛，就是举行联欢会或看电影。他们说，过去在海外时天天愁吃愁穿，如今是百事称心如意。
    新华社昆明5日电　6月下旬到达昆明的两批归国华侨学生二百九十多人，已全部得到妥善安置，并开始了愉快的学习生活。
    在这两批归国华侨学生中，除五名有艺术、体育专长的学生被分别保送到云南艺术学院和云南体育学院学习外，其余二百多人都被分别安置在昆明工学院附属中学和昆明第四、第十五、第十四中学等校读书。他们对祖国的妥善安置非常感激，有些学生写大字报表示决心，争取要成为一个三好学生，来报答祖国无微不至的关怀。
