　　Wheat Harvest Ballads
　　In previous years, the combine harvester strained the back when harvesting wheat. Now, machines run across the wheat fields. Like ships sail on a golden sea, stirring up wave after wave that disappear. Old Zhang, who operates the machine, waves his hand and laughs, "Mechanization of wheat harvesting means no more backbreaking labor from now on."

　　Threshing machine, threshing machine, tall in stature, its neck reaches the poplar treetops. It eats wheat stalks and spits out treasures. The threshing machine is powerful, spewing wheat chaff that obscures the sunset glow. Pearly wheat grains gleam with golden light, instantly forming a large golden pagoda.
　　　　Hebei Anguo　Liu Xia

　　Locomotive boiler machine, locomotive boiler machine, shouts happily, shouts and makes the river water climb up the slope, climb up the slope, irrigating the crops, irrigating the crops making them laugh, irrigating the sorghum until its face turns red, irrigating the corn until it shows its golden teeth, irrigating the cotton until it grins, irrigating the rice until it sways its golden hair, hee hee hee, ha ha ha, the commune has good crops everywhere.
　　　　Zhao Qiqi

　　Moonlit night, bright moon floats in the sky, the wind rolls the wheat waves with a soft sound, the sound of the axe clanging, the old lady gets up quickly. The old man is not in the house, where did he go to bicker again? The old lady pushes open the window to look: outside the window the moonlight is like water. The old man is in the yard, holding an axe and saw in his hand, chopping and sawing busily, what is he doing? Improving the harvesting machine. The old lady is filled with joy, boiling water to cook a chicken. "You don't call me for innovation, I'll punish you with a chicken!" The old man eats the chicken, the old lady smiles happily. Under the moonlight, two gray heads, the sound of the axe and saw never stops.

　　麦收小唱
　　收割机往年割麦累酸腰，如今麦田机器跑，金海上面行轮船，掀起前浪后浪消。开机器的张老汉，一边挥手一边笑：“割麦实现机械化，从今不再累断腰。”
　　脱粒机脱粒机，个子高，脖子齐着杨树梢，吃进去的是麦秸，吐出来的是元宝。脱粒机，威力大，喷出麦糠遮米霞，珍珠麦粒闪金光，转眼出个大金塔。
      河北安国　刘霞
　　锅驼机锅驼机，叫得欢，叫得河水爬上坡，爬上坡，浇庄稼，浇得庄稼笑哈哈，浇得高粱胀红脸，浇得玉米露金牙，浇得棉花咧嘴笑，浇得稻子摇金发，嘻嘻嘻，哈哈哈，社里遍地好庄稼。
        赵奇奇
　　月明夜明月中天浮游，风卷麦浪声细，斧头叮当声响，大娘连忙爬起。老伴不在屋里，又去哪里扯皮？大娘推开窗看：窗外月明如洗。大爷就在院里，手里拿着斧锯，砍砍锯锯忙啥？改良收割机器。大娘满心欢喜，烧水煮个鸡子。“革新也不叫我，罚你吃个鸡子”！大爷吃下鸡子，大娘喜笑嘻嘻。月下两头白发，斧声锯声不息。
