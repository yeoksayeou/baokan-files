    One Step Forward, Step by Step to Strive for the Lead
    Lú Xiāng, Leader of the Fang Zhimin Youth Group, Nanchang Jianye Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Nanchang City Special-Class Labor Model
    By June 23rd, our factory had already completed 56.31% of the annual plan. Our Fang Zhimin Youth Group has half the number of people it had last year, but the total output has increased by 21% compared to the same period last year. The first-class rate of cotton cloth has consistently maintained the factory's highest record of 99.9%, and we completed the first half of the year's plan on June 2nd. With the help of comrades, I am already working on the fourth quarter.
    Since 1958, the Party branch has organized all factory workers to participate in political theory studies, mainly focusing on Chairman Mao's works, which has enabled us to establish the idea of continuous revolution and continuous leaps forward, never being satisfied with small achievements. Over the past two years, due to the vigorous technical revolution, our factory workers have realized mechanized production from manual operation. Since April of this year, we have begun to advance towards automation and high-end, precision, cutting-edge, and new technologies. Currently, seven processes have adopted indigenous cutting-edge technologies, and a large number of high-grade silk fabrics have been woven. The degree of automation and semi-automation is constantly improving. Our group has achieved eight automated innovations, and the worker comrades call us the ever-victorious "Mu Guiying" group. Because of my good collaboration with Hu Lianxiang and Xu Chunxiang, I have been able to exceed the monthly plan every month, and there hasn't been a single second-class cloth in several years. This year, the loom tending rate has increased from two to four looms. The Party helped us summarize the "three fasts" (quick joining, quick shuttle changing, and quick handling of downtime) operating experience of the "Three Xiang" and organized mutual exchange of experiences. In just a few months, the loom tending rate of loom operators throughout the factory generally increased from two to three looms, saving more than 200 people to support the production of new indigenous equipment and expand the factory's production capacity.
    Production is like fighting a war. To fight well, we must first take the initiative. Our factory has already won a comprehensive victory in the first half of the year, but to achieve final victory, we must strive for the lead step by step. Our group has now formulated a continued leap forward plan for the third quarter and has proposed a combat mission to reduce two more people in July to support satellite factories while increasing total output by 15.5% compared to June.

    一步主动  步步争先
    江西南昌市特等劳动模范南昌建业染织厂方志敏青年小组组长
    芦香
    我们厂到六月二十三日止，已经完成了年计划的百分之五十六点三一。我们方志敏青年小组，今年人员比去年减少了一半，可是总产量却比去年同期提高了百分之二十一，棉布正品率一直保持了百分之九十九点九的全厂最高纪录，在六月二日就完成了上半年计划。在同志们的帮助下，我已在干第四季度的活了。
    从一九五八年起，党总支就组织全厂职工参加了以毛主席著作为主的政治理论学习，使我们树立了不断革命、不断跃进的思想，永远不满足于点滴成绩。两年多来，我厂职工由于大搞技术革命，已由手工操作实现了机械化生产。从今年四月份以后，开始向自动化和高、精、尖、新进军，到目前已有七个工序采用了土尖端技术，织出了大批高级丝织品，自动化和半自动化程度正在不断提高。我们小组则实现了八件自动化革新，职工同志们称我们为百战百胜的“穆桂英”小组。我由于和上下班的胡莲香、徐春香的协作搞得比较好，因而计划月月超额完成，几年没有出次布，今年的看台率由两台提高到了四台。党帮助我们总结了三香“三快”（接头快、换梭快、处理停台快）操作经验，组织相互传经送宝。没几个月，全厂挡车工看台率普遍由两台提高到三台，节约了二百多人支援新制土设备投入生产，扩大了工厂生产能力。
    生产好比打仗，要打好仗，必须首先争取主动。我们厂已经夺取了上半年的全面大捷，但是要取得最后胜利，还必须步步争先。我们小组现在已经订好了第三季度的继续跃进计划，并提出了七月份再减少两个人，支援卫星厂，而总产量要比六月份增长百分之十五点五的战斗任务。
