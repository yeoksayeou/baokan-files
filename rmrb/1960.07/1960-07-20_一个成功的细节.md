　　A Successful Detail
　　Tianjin　Cheng Zhiwei
　　Late at night on his day off, police officer Ma Tianmin happily returned from his girlfriend Liu Ping's home. Unexpectedly, when Ma Tianmin opened his door, he found barber Master Wang waiting for him. It turned out that Old Wang wanted to finish the haircut he hadn't completed for Tianmin during the day, so he specially came to his house to wait for him. This vivid detail immediately reminded the audience of what had happened during the day: Ma Tianmin was getting a haircut at the barbershop, preparing to meet his girlfriend whom he hadn't met before that afternoon. Suddenly, a child came to find him, panting, saying that the neighbor's child, Xiao Hua, had suddenly become seriously ill, and the grandmother was anxious and didn't know what to do. Ma Tianmin instinctively stood up, and without caring that his haircut wasn't finished, he rushed to Xiao Hua's house and immediately took the child to the hospital. He didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the child was out of danger. When he arrived at the cinema to meet his girlfriend, the appointed time had long passed, and he had once again broken his date because of meddling in "other people's business." This detail deepened our impression of Ma Tianmin's model action of loving the people like his own family and further demonstrated Ma Tianmin's noble character.
　　And the significance of this detail lies not only in further highlighting Ma Tianmin's image, but also in making us deeply feel that in today's society, advanced workers are not just a few individuals, but many; not only are the model deeds of the people's police worthy of praise, but everyone who creates extraordinary deeds in ordinary jobs is worthy of praise. Barber Old Wang's working principle is to never let customers wait overnight. At night, he still went to Ma Tianmin's home, not afraid of hardship, determined to finish his haircut that day. How noble is this communist style! Our society today is truly a warm family of mutual assistance and love.
　　This detail is used unusually cleverly, but also reasonably. It not only strengthens the artistic effect of the film, but more importantly, enhances the ideological content of the film, which cannot be said to be a successful creation of the directors and screenwriters with unique ingenuity.

　　一个成功的细节
　　天津　成志伟
    休息日的深夜，户籍警马天民愉快地从爱人刘萍家里回来。出人意料的事发生了：当马天民一打开自己的房门，却见理发店的王师傅在等着他。原来老王为了要在当天替天民理完白天没有理完的发，特地来家里等他。这个生动的细节马上使观众再次想起了白天发生的那件事：马天民正在理发店里理发，准备下午去会见还没有见过面的女朋友。突然一个小孩喘着气来找他，说邻家的小华忽然得了急病，奶奶正急得不知怎么办才好。马天民本能地站了起来，也不管还没理完发，就奔到小华家去，马上把孩子护送到医院里去。直到孩子脱离了危险，他才松了一口气。等他赶到电影院跟女朋友会面时，预定的时间早已过去，他又一次因为爱管“闲事”而失约了。这个细节加深了我们对马天民那种爱民如亲的模范行动的印象，进一步显示了马天民的高贵品质。
    而这个细节的意义，不只在于进一步突出了马天民的形象，并且使我们深深地感到在今天的社会里，先进工作者不只是少数几个人，而是有许多；不仅是人民警察的模范事迹值得赞扬，每一个在平凡的工作岗位上创造出不平凡事迹的人都值得歌颂。理发师老王的工作原则是决不让顾客等过夜。夜里，他还不辞劳苦地赶到马天民的家里，坚决要在当天替他理完发，这是多么高尚的共产主义风格！我们今天的社会，真是一个互助友爱的温暖大家庭。
    这个细节运用得异常巧妙，但又合情合理。它不仅加强了影片的艺术效果，更重要的是增强了影片的思想内容，这不能不说是编导们匠心独具的成功创造。
