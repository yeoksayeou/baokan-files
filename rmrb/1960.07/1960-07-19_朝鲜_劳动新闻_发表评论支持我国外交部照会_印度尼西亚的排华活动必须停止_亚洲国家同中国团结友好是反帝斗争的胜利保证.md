Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" today published a commentary entitled "Indonesian Anti-Chinese Activities Must Stop."

The commentary expressed support for the strong protest note lodged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China with the Indonesian government regarding the murder of overseas Chinese, and pointed out that the demands made by the Chinese government in the note are entirely justified.

The commentary pointed out that the People's Republic of China has consistently strived to develop friendly and cooperative relations with its neighbors based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has made sincere and consistent efforts to develop friendly relations between the two countries in its relations with Indonesia. The commentary pointed out that anti-Chinese activities are deliberately and systematically stirred up by a portion of influential groups in Indonesia who are hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia. The commentary listed a series of recent anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia and pointed out that all these actions are extremely unfriendly actions towards the People's Republic of China. As emphasized in the protest note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, "This is completely contrary to the repeated promises made by the Indonesian government."

The commentary said that such inappropriate behavior by the Indonesian authorities cannot but bring more difficulties to the early and satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues in the repatriation of overseas Chinese, and cannot but have a harmful impact on the development of friendly relations between China and Indonesia. All peace-loving people cannot but express deep concern about this.

The commentary pointed out that this abnormal relationship created between China and Indonesia, two friendly countries, hinders the unity of peace and anti-imperialist forces and can only benefit the imperialists. The Western imperialists, especially the US imperialists, seeing that the Asian people's struggle against its war policy and aggression policy is increasingly strengthening, and that its foundation of aggression in Asia is fundamentally shaken, are struggling to maintain and restore its foundation of aggression. In order to split and weaken the anti-imperialist peace forces, they are desperately slandering and defaming the powerful socialist country of Asia, the People's Republic of China, and are carrying out various conspiracies to create divisions between the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.

The commentary said that at this moment, the unfriendly activities towards its great neighbor, the People's Republic of China, being carried out in Indonesia are regrettable.

The commentary said that as the people of all Asian countries, including Indonesia, have personally experienced, the friendly unity of the Asian people, especially the friendly unity between the great People's Republic of China and other Asian countries, is a reliable guarantee for achieving victory in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The commentary said that the People's Republic of China has consistently and resolutely supported and supports the Indonesian people's struggle to defend independence, independent development, and the liberation of West Irian, together with all peace-loving countries.

The commentary pointed out that in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and for the defense of Asian and world peace, the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is infinitely valuable. China and Indonesia have always encouraged and supported each other in the just struggle, and there is no problem that cannot be solved between them as long as both sides show sincerity.

The commentary said that the People's Republic of China has expressed its sincere desire to continue to cooperate with Indonesia in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle in the future, and has made every effort to develop friendly relations between the two countries and to resolve the issue of overseas Chinese justly and comprehensively. The question is how sincere the Indonesian side is.

The commentary said that the Korean people, together with the Indonesian people and all peace-loving people in Asia, expect the Indonesian government to stop anti-Chinese activities, respond to the sincerity of the government of the People's Republic of China, resolve the issue of overseas Chinese satisfactorily at an early date, and contribute to uniting the peace forces against imperialism.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Asian people must unite more firmly in the struggle against imperialism headed by US imperialism, and make joint efforts for world peace, human security, and progress.

　　朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表评论支持我国外交部照会
　　印度尼西亚的排华活动必须停止
　　亚洲国家同中国团结友好是反帝斗争的胜利保证
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“印度尼西亚的排华活动必须停止”的评论。
    评论表示支持中华人民共和国外交部就杀害华侨事件向印度尼西亚政府提出的强硬抗议照会，并指出中国政府在照会中提出的要求是完全正当的。
    评论指出，中华人民共和国根据和平共处五项原则一直努力发展同邻国的友好合作关系，在同印度尼西亚的关系中也为了发展两国间的友好关系作了始终一贯的真挚的努力。评论指出，排华活动是由对中国和印度尼西亚间的友好怀有敌意的印度尼西亚一部分有势力集团故意地、有系统地挑起来的。评论列举了近来在印度尼西亚发生的一系列的排华活动，并且指出，这一切行动都是对中华人民共和国的极其不友好的行动。正如中华人民共和国外交部这次提出的抗议照会中强调的一样，“这同印度尼西亚政府一再作出的诺言是完全背道而驰的。”
    评论说，印度尼西亚当局的这种不当行为，不能不给早日圆满解决华侨归国问题中的悬而未决的问题带来更多的困难，也不能不为发展中国和印度尼西亚两国间的友好关系带来有害的影响。一切爱好和平的人民不能不对此表示深切的忧虑。
    评论指出，在中国和印度尼西亚这两个友好国家间造成的这种不正常的关系，有碍于和平和反帝国主义力量的团结，结果只能对帝国主义者有利。西方帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者看到亚洲人民反对它的战争政策和侵略政策的斗争日益加强，它在亚洲的侵略基础从根本上被动摇，正在为维持和恢复其侵略基础进行挣扎。他们为了分裂和削弱反帝国主义和平力量拼命地中伤和诽谤亚洲的强大的社会主义国家中华人民共和国，并且为了在中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家之间制造分裂进行着各种阴谋活动。
    评论说，正当这时，在印度尼西亚进行的对它的伟大邻邦——中华人民共和国的不友好活动，是不能不令人遗憾的。
    评论说，正如包括印度尼西亚在内的一切亚洲国家人民亲身体验到的一样，亚洲人民的友好团结，特别是伟大的中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家间的友好团结是使反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争取得胜利的可靠的保证。评论说，中华人民共和国同一切爱好和平国家一道一直坚决地支持了和支持着印度尼西亚人民的为保卫独立、独立发展和解放西伊里安的斗争。
    评论指出，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民间的友好合作是无限宝贵的。中国和印度尼西亚两国在正义的斗争中一直是互相鼓舞和支持的，他们之间只要双方都一致表示诚意就没有不能解决的问题。
    评论说，中华人民共和国已经表示今后在反帝国主义反殖民主义的斗争中继续同印度尼西亚合作的真挚的愿望，并且为发展两国间的友好关系，为正当地、全面地解决华侨问题作了它力所能及的努力。问题在于印度尼西亚方面的诚意如何了。
    评论说，朝鲜人民和印度尼西亚人民以及亚洲一切爱好和平人民一道期待印度尼西亚政府一定要停止排华活动，响应中华人民共和国政府的诚意，早日圆满地解决华侨问题，为团结反对帝国主义的和平力量作出贡献。
    评论最后说，亚洲人民在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义斗争中必须更加牢固地团结起来，为世界和平、人类安全和进步作出共同的努力。
