　　Anshan Area of Liaoning Launches Mass Pest Elimination Campaign to Protect Seedlings

    This newspaper, Yinchuan, 17th – In Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, various locations are employing methods such as manual and mechanical capturing and beating to vigorously eliminate crop diseases and pests. The region has already treated over 700,000 mu of crops severely affected by various diseases and pests.

    This year, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region experienced early outbreaks of diseases and pests, with a large number of species affecting a wide area. Some pests occurred concurrently, with several pests even attacking simultaneously. For example, over 900,000 mu of millet in the Guyuan area were widely affected by corn borers, while corn, sugar beets, and other crops in the Yellow River irrigation area were widely affected by cutworms and other pests. To ensure increased production of grain and other crops and strive for a bumper harvest this year, various locations began a widespread struggle against diseases and pests in May. The Guyuan area adopted a combined approach of manual capture and aerial spraying and has now treated over 250,000 mu of summer and autumn crops affected by rice bugs, corn borers, and underground pests. In Ningsuo County, under the personal leadership of the County Party Secretary, a 10,000-strong pest elimination army was organized. Various measures for preventing and controlling diseases and pests were formulated based on local conditions, and pesticides were applied and pests were captured in conjunction with weeding and irrigation. Within five days, the county eliminated the damage caused by cutworms.

    Currently, in addition to transferring chemical pesticides and equipment, and manufacturing a large number of local pesticides and local machinery such as gypsum, various locations have also strengthened the work of predicting and forecasting diseases and pests.

    This newspaper reports – Due to abnormal weather and excessive rainfall, various diseases and pests have occurred in succession in the Anshan area of Liaoning, especially armyworms, which have come on strongly and are widespread in over 30,000 hectares of valley land and parts of wheat, sorghum, and corn fields. In view of this situation, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Municipal People's Committee, in accordance with the Provincial Party Committee's "Five Grabs, One Prevention" directive, quickly launched a massive and grand mass movement to eliminate pests and protect seedlings throughout the area. During the peak period from June 27 to July 2, 310,000 people were mobilized daily to participate in the pest elimination and seedling protection battle, basically controlling the harm of armyworms. In the pest elimination work, leading cadres at all levels went to the front line to participate in and direct the battle, and a strong pest elimination command structure was established from top to bottom. Yang Kebing, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee, and the Minister of the Rural Work Department and other leading cadres went to Liaoyang City, Haicheng County, Anshan Suburban District, and the Liu'erbu and Niuzhuang Communes under their jurisdiction to direct the battle. Cao Qi, First Secretary of the Liaoyang Municipal Committee, Secretaries Guo Tingjun and Li Geng, and the heads of various departments and bureaus went to the Shaling, Tong'erbu, Liu'erbu, and Dengta Communes, which were severely affected by armyworms, to participate in and direct the battle.

    In the pest elimination and seedling protection movement, urban agencies, factories, mines, and schools provided strong support. A total of 113,000 agency cadres, factory and mine workers, and school students participated in the pest elimination throughout the area. Commercial departments and transportation departments also delivered pesticides to production teams and fields day and night.

    At present, the harm of armyworms has been brought under control, but spotty pest outbreaks have not been completely eliminated. In particular, pests such as aphids and corn borers have occurred successively, and the masses are advancing victoriously and continuing to launch a campaign to eliminate pests. (Attached image)

    本报银川17日电　宁夏回族自治区各地采取人工和机械捕打等办法，大力消灭农作物的病虫害，全区已防治了被各种病虫为害较严重的作物面积达七十多万亩。
    今年，宁夏回族自治区发生病虫害的时间早、种类多、面积大，有些病虫交错发生，甚至几种病虫同时为害。如固原专区九十多万亩糜子，普遍发生钻心虫害，黄河灌区的玉米、甜菜等，也普遍发生地老虎等病虫害。为了确保粮食等作物增产，力争今年丰收，各地从5月份开始，就普遍展开了同病虫害的斗争。固原专区采取人工捕捉、飞机撒药齐出动的办法，现在已防治了对夏秋作物为害的吸浆虫、钻心虫、地下虫害等二十五万多亩。宁朔县在县委书记亲自带领下，组织了万人的灭虫大军，因田因地制定各种防治病虫害的措施，并结合锄草、灌水进行施药和捕捉，五天内就在全县消灭了地老虎的为害。
    目前，各地除调运化学农药和器械大量制造石膏等土农药和土机械外，还加强了对病虫的预测、预报工作。
    本报讯　辽宁鞍山地区由于气候不正常，雨水较多，各种病虫害相继发生，特别是夜盗虫来势凶猛，在三万多垧谷地和部分小麦、高粱、玉米等地里普遍发生。鉴于这种情况，中共鞍山市委和鞍山市人民委员会根据省委“五抢一防”的指示精神，在全区范围内迅速掀起了一个声势浩大，规模壮阔的群众性的灭虫保苗运动。在6月27日到7月2日高潮期间，每天出动三十一万大军参加灭虫保苗大战，基本控制了夜盗虫的危害。在灭虫工作中，各级领导干部都亲赴前线，参加战斗，指挥战斗，并从上到下建立了一个强力的灭虫指挥机构。鞍山市委杨克冰书记和农村工作部部长等领导干部，分别深入到辽阳市、海城县、鞍山郊区及所属的刘二卜、牛庄等公社指挥战斗。辽阳市委第一书记曹琦、书记郭廷俊、李耕和各部、局长等领导干部分别深入夜盗虫为害严重的沙岭、佟二卜、刘二卜、灯塔等公社参加战斗、指挥战斗。
    在灭虫保苗运动中，城市的机关、厂矿、学校都给予大力支援，全区参加灭虫的机关干部、厂矿职工、学校学生共有十一万三千多人。商业部门和交通部门也不分昼夜地把农药送到各生产队，送到田间。
    目前夜盗虫的危害，已被控制住了，但点片的虫灾还没有彻底消灭，特别是蚜虫和玉米螟等虫害又相继发生，广大群众正在乘胜前进，继续向虫害开展扑灭战。（附图片）
