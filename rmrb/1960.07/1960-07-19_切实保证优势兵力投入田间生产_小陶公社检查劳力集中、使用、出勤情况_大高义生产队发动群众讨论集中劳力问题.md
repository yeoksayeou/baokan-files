To resolutely ensure the investment of superior forces in field production.
　　Xiaotao Commune inspects labor concentration, use, and attendance
　　Dagaoyi Production Team mobilizes the masses to discuss labor concentration issues

　　This newspaper reports that after concentrating its main force on agricultural production, Xiaotao Commune in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, further inspected the use of labor. The results of the inspection showed that some production teams still had the phenomenon of decentralized use of labor. For example, out of the seventy laborers in the Second Production Team of Xiaotao Brigade, as many as thirty-two were used for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production and logistics departments, accounting for 46%, while only thirty-eight were actually used for grain production, accounting for 54%. Moreover, seven or eight laborers with rice transplanting, plowing, and other skills were transferred to engage in sideline occupations, logistics, and other work. Through the investigation of the labor arrangement in this production team, the commune party committee decided to carry out a labor "three checks" campaign throughout the commune, that is, to check whether the labor force on the grain production front reached more than 80% during the busy farming season; to check whether the use of labor was reasonable; and to check whether the attendance rate met the requirements. Through the "three checks," it was further affirmed that the unconcentrated and unreasonable use of labor on the agricultural front itself was a common phenomenon. Therefore, the party committee started by grasping ideology, organizing commune members to discuss issues such as "Why take grain as the key link?" and "How to take grain as the key link?" so that the vast number of cadres and commune members understood that to take agriculture as the foundation, we must first take grain as the key link. Through discussion, many cadres and commune members realized the significance of concentrating labor to vigorously grasp grain production. Therefore, they unanimously advocated that during the busy period of summer harvest and summer planting, the most important labor force should be used for grain production to ensure the comprehensive victory of summer harvest and summer planting.

　　After improving understanding through discussion, the commune party committee, following the principle of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," proposed that technical laborers return to the team and strong laborers return to the team, and made reasonable arrangements for the labor force on the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery fronts. First, according to seasonal changes, some productions that could be suspended or postponed were suspended or postponed, and part of the labor force released was strengthened on the grain production front. For example, the entire commune's sideline occupation front originally had 1,010 laborers, accounting for 14% of the agricultural labor force. These people were engaged in more than a dozen collective sideline occupations such as burning lime, cutting mao bamboo, making paper, rafting wood, and cutting firewood. According to past habits, these sideline productions were mostly carried out during the slack farming season and less or not at all during the busy farming season. After re-arranging, only 300 people were left to persist in sideline productions such as burning lime and cutting mao bamboo, and 700 people were drawn out to strengthen the summer harvest and summer planting front. Second, according to the new situation of promoting tool reform, the surplus labor force on the forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery fronts was adjusted to strengthen the grain front. For example, the entire commune originally had 560 laborers responsible for raising pigs and watching cattle, accounting for 7.3% of the agricultural labor force. After vigorously carrying out tool reform, this could be reduced to 320 people, accounting for 4.3% of the agricultural labor force. The canteens in the entire commune that originally burned firewood have now all been converted to burning coal, and 480 laborers who were engaged in firewood alone have been saved. In addition, with tool reform and improved labor efficiency, the number of cooks has been reduced from the original 980, accounting for 13% of the agricultural labor force, to 680, accounting for 8.8% of the agricultural labor force.

　　After the commune took the above measures, the labor force on the agricultural front was quickly concentrated on the grain front. The labor force participating in summer harvest, summer planting, and summer field management reached more than 6,000 people, accounting for more than 80% of the total agricultural labor force. Due to the increase in labor, the speed of summer harvest and summer planting was accelerated. For example, after the labor force for harvesting and planting early rice in the Xiaotao Management Area increased to 86%, the daily harvesting of early rice increased from 33 mu to 47 mu, and the daily planting of sweet potatoes increased from 17 mu to 47 mu.

　　This newspaper reports that seizing the current golden season for agricultural production and comprehensively managing spring and summer crops lies in the reasonable arrangement of labor. Dagaoyi Production Team of Wangtong Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, has ensured the all-round leap forward in production by excellently grasping this key point.

　　Dagaoyi Production Team has 149 men and women, whole and semi-laborers, with 2,141 mu of cultivated land, averaging 14.3 mu per laborer. This year, the task of fighting drought is heavy and more high-yield crops are planted, and labor is very tight. The cadres of the Dagaoyi Production Team first calculated the accounts while sitting in the office, and the more they calculated, the more difficult it became. The party branch then decided to hand this issue over to the masses for discussion, and put forward three specific questions: (1) How should the current farm work be done? (2) How much labor is required for these tasks? How much work can be completed? (3) How to solve the shortage of labor? During the discussion of the first question, everyone unanimously agreed that the current period is the golden season for production, and the work must be guaranteed in terms of quality and quantity. After carefully calculating the accounts, the team was short about 8,000 workdays in the entire quarter.

　　Relying on the opinions of the masses, this production team prominently grasped the following three points in labor organization: (1) The 149 laborers were divided into four fronts. Taking agricultural production as the center, 114 laborers were invested, accounting for 76% of the total labor force; animal husbandry reduced from the original 23 people to 9 people through merging groups and reforming breeding tools; the logistics front carried out a major reform of cooking utensils, realizing the self-flowing of water, the mechanization of grinding flour and rice, and the steam of cooking, and the cooks reduced from the original 29 people to 13 people; and 13 women were arranged for sideline production to maintain production. This not only strengthened the main attack front, but also took care of other tasks. (2) Labor is assigned according to the work, and tasks are assigned according to the person, so as to ensure that the strength, expertise, and energy of the labor force are used. In order to ensure that the farm work is guaranteed in terms of quality and quantity, a contracting system based on work groups is also implemented.

　　(3) A large amount of labor was saved by adopting the methods of cleverly combining multiple aspects, combining whole work and odd jobs, combining whole work and spare time, and combining work and transportation.

　　Due to the concerted efforts of commune members and cadres, the labor days actually completed by this production team in the second quarter reached 21,300, accounting for 112% of the planned work days for the whole quarter. (Attached picture)

　　切实保证优势兵力投入田间生产
　　小陶公社检查劳力集中、使用、出勤情况
　　大高义生产队发动群众讨论集中劳力问题
    本报讯　福建永安县小陶公社在集中主力投入农业生产后，进一步检查了劳力使用情况。检查结果说明，部分生产队仍有分散使用劳力的现象。例如小陶大队第二生产队的七十名劳力中，用于林牧副渔业生产和后勤部门的劳力达三十二人，占46％，而实际用于粮食生产的劳力只有三十八人，占54％。而且把七、八个有插秧、犁田等技术的劳力调去搞副业、后勤及其他工作。公社党委通过对这个生产队劳力安排情况的调查，决定在全公社开展劳力“三查”运动，即查粮食生产战线劳力在农事大忙时是否达到80％以上；查劳力使用是否合理；查出勤率是否达到要求。通过
  “三查”，进一步肯定了农业战线本身的劳力使用不集中、不合理是个普遍现象，于是党委从抓思想入手，组织社员讨论“为什么要以粮为纲”“怎样以粮为纲”等问题，使广大干部和社员明确了要以农业为基础，首先就要以粮为纲。通过讨论，许多干部和社员都认识了集中劳力大抓粮食生产的意义，因而，一致主张在夏收夏种大忙的时期，要拿出最主要的劳力来搞粮食生产，保证夏收夏种的全面胜利。
    通过讨论提高认识后，公社党委按照“以粮为纲、带动全面”的原则，提出技术劳力归队，强劳力归队，对农林牧副渔各条战线劳力作了合理安排。首先根据季节的变化将一些可以不搞或推迟搞的生产暂停或推迟，腾出的一部分劳力加强粮食生产战线。例如全社副业战线原有劳力一千零十人，占农业劳力的14％。这些人搞的集体副业有烧石灰、砍毛竹、制纸、放木排、砍柴等十几项。这些副业生产按过去的习惯是农闲多搞，农忙少搞或不搞。现在重新安排以后，只留三百人坚持烧石灰、砍毛竹等副业生产，就抽出了七百人加强夏收夏种战线。其次根据推行工具改革的新情况，把林牧副渔各战线多余的劳力调整出来，加强粮食战线。例如全社原来负责养猪看牛的劳力有五百六十人，占农业劳力7.3％，大搞工具改革以后，可以减少到三百二十人，占农业劳力的4.3％。全社原来烧柴火的食堂，现在全部改为烧煤，光是搞柴火的劳力就节省出四百八十人，加上工具改革，提高劳动效率，炊事人员由原来的九百八十人，占农业劳力的13％，减少到六百八十人，占农业劳力的8.8％。
    这个公社采取上述措施后，农业战线的劳力，迅速集中到粮食战线上来，参加夏收夏种和夏季田间管理的劳力达六千多人，占农业战线总劳力80％以上。由于劳力增加，夏收夏种速度加快，如小陶管理区收种劳力增加到86％后，日割早稻由三十三亩提高到四十七亩，日种番薯由十七亩增加到四十七亩。
    本报讯　抓紧当前农业生产的黄金季节，全面管好春、夏播作物的关键在于合理安排劳力。河北吴桥县王瞳公社大高义生产队由于出色地抓好这一手，从而保证了生产的全面跃进。
    大高义生产队男女整半劳力一百四十九人，耕地二千一百四十一亩，平均每个劳力负担十四点三亩。今年抗旱任务大，种植高产作物多，劳力十分紧张。大高义生产队的干部最先是坐在办公室里算账，结果越算越为难。党支部于是决定把这个问题交给群众讨论，并且提出了三个具体问题：（一）当前的农活怎样干？（二）这些活路需要多少工？能完成多少工？（三）缺工如何解决？讨论第一个问题时，大家一致认为，当前是生产上的黄金季节，干活一定要保质保量。经过算细账，全队在整个季度共缺工八千个左右。
    这个生产队依靠群众的意见，在劳动组织上突出地抓住以下三点：（一）一百四十九名劳力，划分为四条战线。以农业生产为中心，投入劳力一百一十四人，占总劳力的76％；畜牧业通过并群和改革饲养工具，由原来二十三人压缩到九人；后勤战线大搞炊具改革，已实现了用水自流化，磨面碾米机械化和做饭蒸汽化，炊事员由原来二十九人减少到十三人；副业生产安排了十三名妇女维持生产。这样既加强了主攻战线，又照顾了其他活路。（二）按活定劳力，因人定任务，以保证劳力强弱、专长能量才使用，为了做到农活保质保量，还实行了按作业组为单位的包工制度。
  （三）采取巧安排多面结合、整活和零活结合、整工和业余结合，以及上下工和运输相结合的办法，节约了大量的劳力。
    由于社员干部同心协力，这个生产队在第二季度实际完成的劳动日达二万一千三百个，占全季计划用工数的112％。（附图片）
