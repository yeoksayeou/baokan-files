Fujian Overseas Chinese Hometowns Industrial and Agricultural Production is Booming
    This newspaper reports: Under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line, industrial and agricultural production in the overseas Chinese areas of Fujian is undergoing an unprecedented period of rapid development. The overseas Chinese hometowns have already changed their historical face of grain shortage. Now, grain production in the overseas Chinese hometowns is more than self-sufficient, and various economic crops such as peanuts, sugarcane, and jute have also achieved successive bumper harvests, increasing by multiples or several times compared to before liberation. Fruit production has also been increasing year by year, and animal husbandry has also developed rapidly. Everywhere we can see scenes of bumper grain harvests, lush fruit trees, and flourishing livestock. On the industrial production front, "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" of industries are blossoming everywhere. After ending the history of being empty-handed, the people of the overseas Chinese hometowns can now manufacture various industrial products such as motors and machine tools themselves. The consumption towns of the past have now become producing towns. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the material and living standards of the people have been greatly improved. In order to build the overseas Chinese hometowns even more beautiful and prosperous, the vast number of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and local people are working together with soaring revolutionary vigor to strive for the continued great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1960.
    Fujian overseas Chinese hometowns are distributed in more than 40 counties and cities throughout the province, with a total of more than two million returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. Before liberation, under the cruel rule and oppression of successive reactionary regimes, the rural areas of Fujian overseas Chinese hometowns were bankrupt, the cities were desolate, there were wars and chaos, epidemics were rampant, and bandits were rampant. For thousands of years, many laborers were forced to leave their homes, abandon their wives and children, and drift overseas to make a living every year. After liberation, due to the political and economic liberation of the people in the overseas Chinese hometowns, their enthusiasm for production soared unprecedentedly. After the land reform, a large number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese warmly responded to the Party's call and embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. In order to thoroughly change the backwardness of agricultural production in the rural areas of the overseas Chinese hometowns, the Party and the government led the people of the overseas Chinese hometowns to carry out farmland capital construction mainly focusing on water conservancy construction. Especially after the communization, relying on collective strength, the scale of farmland capital construction was even larger. Because the people of the overseas Chinese hometowns exerted their determination to conquer nature and relied on the great superiority of the people's communes, they overcame various natural disasters, carried out intensive cultivation, implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and achieved continuous bumper harvests of grain. In 1959, the coastal overseas Chinese hometowns in the Jinjiang Special Zone, although suffered from several strong typhoons, floods, and tides, the total grain output still increased by 23.9% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the entire special zone has already achieved grain self-sufficiency. In Jinjiang County, the main overseas Chinese hometown in this special zone, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, half of the grain had to rely on imports of foreign rice every year. After liberation, due to the large-scale water conservancy construction movement, more than 80% of the farmland in the county has basically eliminated the threat of waterlogging and drought. Therefore, grain production has been rising year by year. Last year, the total grain output of the county reached 505 million catties, an increase of 37.8% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, realizing a "thousand-catty county." This year, spring crops such as wheat, barley and rapeseed in the overseas Chinese hometowns of Fujian have also achieved bumper harvests. At present, agricultural production has entered a busy stage, and people's communes in various overseas Chinese hometowns are striving for even greater bumper harvests of summer crops.
    There was originally no industry in the overseas Chinese hometowns, only a few dilapidated small power plants, printing plants, and rice mills. Now, factories are spread like chess pieces everywhere in the overseas Chinese hometowns, from the plains to the inland areas, from the coast to the mountainous areas, and chimneys stand tall. According to statistics at the end of 1959, the Jinjiang Special Zone alone had more than 1,330 factories of various types, including the modern "small foreign group" metallurgical industry centered on the Hongzhou Steel Plant and the Hanjiang Steel Plant, and the four major steel bases of Anxi, Yongchun, Dehua, and Datian. There is also a huge light industry network mainly composed of sugar, salt, and food, and other industries such as the machinery industry, forest chemical industry, electric power and water conservancy industry, and chemical fertilizer industry are also emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. At the same time, due to the consolidation and development of the people's communes, commune-run industries are even more like stars in the sky, spread throughout the overseas Chinese hometowns. In 1959, commune-run industries in the Jinjiang Special Zone alone manufactured, improved, and promoted more than 5.89 million pieces of various new-style farm implements, which strongly supported agricultural production. Last year, the total industrial output value of this special zone increased by 42% compared to 1958, initially changing the backward face of industry in the overseas Chinese areas. Now, the people of the entire region are enthusiastically launching a production increase and economy campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. In the first quarter of this year, the total industrial output value of the entire special zone increased by 58.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, achieving a good start and a complete victory. Yongchun County in the overseas Chinese hometowns has also achieved great results in fully utilizing abundant water resources to develop water conservancy and power industries. Now, the county has 37 small hydropower stations and 486 water power stations. The use of these water power stations and hydropower stations has enabled the rapid realization of power mechanization in the processing of agricultural and sideline products throughout the county, and has also played a significant role in supporting the development of agriculture. Now, Xiamen City has more than 200 factories, and the people of Xiamen can now wear fine cloth produced by themselves.
    With the continuous improvement of people's socialist and patriotic ideological awareness, "Striving to be a model on the labor front, and being diligent and thrifty is the most glorious" has become a new social atmosphere in the overseas Chinese hometowns. The vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese actively participate in various labor activities of the people's communes and strive to learn production technology. Many people have now become heroes on the production and labor front. Last year, 159 returned overseas Chinese in Putian County won the title of activists in socialist construction.

    工厂棋布　烟囱林立　五谷丰登　六畜兴旺
    福建侨乡工农业生产蓬勃发展
    本报讯　在党的总路线光辉照耀下，福建侨区工农业生产正在经历着一个空前的飞速发展时期，侨乡已经改变了历史上缺粮的面貌。现在侨乡粮食生产自给有余，花生、甘蔗、黄麻等多种经济作物也都连获丰收，比解放前成倍或数倍地增长；水果产品也年年增加，畜牧业同样得到迅速发展，到处可以看到五谷丰登、果树苍郁、六畜兴旺的局面。在工业生产战线上，“小土群”、“小洋群”工业遍地开花。侨乡人民在结束了手无寸铁的历史后，已经自己能制造电机、机床等各种工业产品。过去的侨乡消费集镇，现在都已变为生产的市镇。随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，人民的物质和生活水平得到很大提高。为了把侨乡建设得更加美丽，更加富饶，广大归侨、侨眷和当地人民一起，正鼓足冲天的革命干劲，为争取1960年工农业生产持续大跃进而努力。
    福建侨乡分布在全省四十多个县、市内，共有归侨、侨眷二百多万人。解放前的福建侨乡，在历代反动政权的残酷统治和压榨下，农村破产，城市萧条，兵荒马乱，疫疠流行，盗匪猖獗。千百年来，每年都有许多劳动人民被迫背乡离井，抛妻别子，飘流到海外去谋生。解放后，侨乡人民由于政治上经济上的解放，生产积极性空前高涨。土地改革后，大批归侨、侨眷热烈响应党的号召，走上了互助合作道路。为了彻底改变侨乡农村生产落后面貌，党和政府领导侨乡人民开展以兴修水利为主的农田基本建设，特别是公社化后，依靠集体力量，农田基本建设规模更大，由于侨乡人民发挥了人定胜天的毅力，依靠人民公社巨大优越性，战胜了各种自然灾害，进行了精耕细作，贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，取得了粮食的连续丰收。1959年晋江专区沿海侨乡，虽然遭受数次强台风、洪水和海潮等灾害的侵袭，但粮食总产量仍比大跃进的1958年增产23.9％，全专区的粮食已经作到了自给有余。这个专区主要侨乡晋江县，在国民党反动政权统治时期，每年有一半粮食要靠洋米进口。解放后由于开展大规模兴修水利运动，全县80％以上的农田已基本上消除了水旱灾害的威胁，因此，粮食产量年年上升。去年全县粮食产量已达五亿零五百万斤，比大跃进的1958年还增长37.8％，实现了千斤县。今年福建侨乡春季作物大、小麦、油菜又获得了丰收。目前农业生产已进入大忙阶段，侨乡各地人民公社正在力争夏季作物获得更大的丰收。
    侨乡原来没有什么工业，只有几家破破烂烂的小电厂、印刷厂和碾米厂，现在侨乡从平原到内地、从沿海到山区，到处工厂棋布，烟囱林立，截至1959年底统计，仅晋江专区就有各种工厂一千三百三十多座，其中有以洪州钢铁厂、涵江钢铁厂为中心的现代化“小洋群”冶金工业和安（溪）、永（春）、德（化）、大（田）的四大钢铁基地，有以糖、盐、食品为主体的庞大的轻工业网，其它如机械工业、森林化学工业、电力水利工业、化学肥料工业也如雨后春笋蒸蒸日上。同时由于人民公社的巩固和发展，社办工业更是满天星斗，遍布全区各侨乡。1959年晋江专区社办工业仅制造改良和推广各种新式农具就有五百八十九万多件，有力地支援了农业生产。去年这个专区的工业总产值比1958年增长42％，初步改变了侨区工业的落后面貌。现在全区人民正在热火朝天地掀起以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。今年第一季度全专区工业产值比去年第四季度增长58.2％获得了开门红、满堂红。侨乡永春县在充分利用丰富的水利资源发展水利电力工业方面，也取得了很大成绩。现在全县已拥有小型水电站三十七处，水力站四百八十六处，利用这些水力站、水电站使全县农副产品加工迅速实现了动力机械化，在支援农业的发展上也起了很大的作用。现在厦门市共有工厂二百多个，厦门人民已经可以穿到自己生产的细布了。
    随着人民社会主义和爱国主义思想觉悟的不断提高，“劳动战线争模范，勤俭节约最光荣”已成为侨乡新的社会风气。广大归侨、侨眷积极参加人民公社各项劳动，并努力学习生产技术。不少人现已成为生产劳动战线上的英雄人物，去年莆田县就有一百五十九个归侨荣获社会主义建设积极分子的称号。
