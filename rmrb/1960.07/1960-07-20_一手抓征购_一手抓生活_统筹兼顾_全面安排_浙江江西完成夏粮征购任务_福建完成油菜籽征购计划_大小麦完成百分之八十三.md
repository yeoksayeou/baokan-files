After the harvest, people's communes in various regions enthusiastically sold good grain to the state. By the end of June, the province had completed its grain procurement tasks ahead of schedule.

In its grain procurement work, Zhejiang Province simultaneously carried out grain procurement with internal commune distribution and arrangements for the people's livelihood, adhering to the principle of overall consideration and rational arrangement, reserving sufficient food rations, seeds, and fodder, to ensure satisfaction of the state, the collective, and the commune members. At the same time, the procurement tasks were assigned to production teams at each level, with grain departments signing storage contracts with production teams, and organizing storage in a timely, fixed-point, quality-assured, and quantitative manner, thereby making grain procurement and storage work both fast and good.

All parts of the province made full use of past experience, launched a large-scale mass movement, and organized commune members to harvest, thresh, sell, and distribute grain simultaneously. Party committee secretaries at all levels in Ruichang County took the lead, organizing more than 10,000 commune members into more than 1,000 shock teams, to harvest, thresh, and sell grain simultaneously. In three days, they completed the harvesting and threshing of more than 70,000 mu of summer grain, and sold 1.78 million jin of summer grain, completing the state's summer grain procurement plan one month ahead of schedule compared to previous years.

After educating commune members in Chengxiang Commune of Putian County, the commune members said: Cities and industries support us in carrying out technological transformation and support us in fighting against disasters, enabling us to achieve a bumper harvest. If we increase production, we must support national construction. Therefore, they were very enthusiastic about selling grain, and completed the delivery plan for wheat, barley, and oil crops in just two days.
