Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 7th: The Communist Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province are firmly grasping the final period of summer planting, resolutely ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of summer planting tasks, and conscientiously implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation.

Currently, leading cadres at all levels and the vast majority of commune members in the province have投入 themselves into the great inspection and comparison movement of summer planting. From the provincial party committee to the commune party committee, leading cadres at all levels are personally going deep into the fields to further promote the work of rushing to plant and expanding planting. In the Wuhu Special District, more than 60,000 cadres above the production brigade level and members are engaged in production together, and the summer planting task of the entire special district has been completed more than 95%. In the Bengbu Special District, the number of cadres at the section and bureau chief level or above transferred from the directly affiliated organs of the prefectural party committee to the countryside accounts for 72% of the total number of cadres at the same level in the current organs. The Fuyang, Anqing, and Liu'an prefectural party committees have dispatched a large number of cadres and formed inspection teams led by the prefectural party committee secretaries to promote the comprehensive development of the summer planting inspection and comparison movement.

In launching the mass summer planting inspection and comparison movement, party committees at all levels vigorously promoted the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and publicized the great significance of planting more and planting well, making the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation even more deeply rooted in people's hearts. At the same time, in their actual work, they focused on grasping backward areas and weak links, and led the masses to implement the method of solving problems while inspecting, helping areas that had not completed the summer planting task to accelerate the completion of their tasks. In addition to comprehensively organizing cadres at five levels to gather in the fields to conduct summer planting inspections and comparisons, Jinzhai County also formed an inspection group of 25 county party committee cadres, who patrolled more than 200 li, focusing on inspecting remote areas and “dead corners.” For example, the Guangming Brigade of the Youdian Commune completed its summer planting task very poorly due to insufficient labor and animal power. They organized two neighboring brigades to support them with more than 200 laborers and 15 head of draught cattle to rush to plant. As a result, the Guangming Brigade quickly completed the summer planting task with quality and quantity. During the inspection, they also discovered that the thin land of the Baida Commune was sparsely planted and field management was not keeping up. They helped them actively arrange more than 500 laborers to replant 910 mu of seedlings and irrigate 1,120 mu of fields in one day. Dai Erzhen, the first secretary of the Tianchang County Party Committee, participated in production in the Ganqiao Production Team of the Qinren Commune. He found that the team's labor was not properly arranged, and the labor used for rushing to plant was less than 30%, so the progress was very slow. He helped the team concentrate 80% of the labor to rush to plant and greatly improve the tools, which accelerated the summer planting progress by nearly three times. Feidong County also dispatched 526 cadres to settle down in backward areas, grasping summer planting while grasping management.

In areas that have completed the summer planting plan, a surge of expansion has been set off through large-scale inspections and comparisons. Ningguo County has adopted the measures of “three ascents to the mountains” (corn, sesame, and soybeans ascend to the mountains). More than 20,000 people are投入 themselves into the expansion activities every day, and the planting area of summer corn has now increased by 51%. After completing the summer planting task, Wuwei County also carried out inspections to find and fill the "white" gaps, continuing to use every inch of land to expand the summer planting area. In just a few days, the county expanded the planting of crops by more than 160,000 mu. The Liu'an Special District, which has completed the summer planting task of oil crops, is using vacant land and intercropping to expand the planting of sesame, soybeans, and peanuts. According to statistics from only four counties, including Shouxian, Jinzhai, Lujiang, and Liu'an, more than 237,000 mu of oil crops have been expanded.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 7th: Party organizations at all levels in Guizhou Province are concentrating their efforts on grasping agricultural production. Cadres from six levels—province, special district, county, commune, management district, and production team—led by party committee secretaries at all levels, gathered in the fields to lead the vast number of commune members in carrying out a thorough and detailed production inspection, focusing on checking the planting area, planting quality, and crop growth. Through the inspection, a surge of expansion, replanting, intercropping, and topdressing has been set off throughout the province.

This large-scale inspection is unprecedented. In the four regions of Anshun, Bijie, Qiannan, and Tongren alone, more than 60,000 cadres at all levels participated in the inspection. In order to avoid weakening the strength of the front line of production due to the large-scale inspection activities, all localities adopted the method of not leaving the county, not leaving the commune, not leaving the team, and returning to the team immediately after participating in the inspection.

This production inspection was more in-depth, practical, meticulous, and comprehensive than any previous one. It checked not only the central areas, but also the marginal areas; not only the advanced areas, but also the backward areas; not only the paddy fields, but also the dry land; not only the high-yield dams, but also the remote areas; and not only the grain crops, but also the cash crops. Inspectors generally participated in production while inspecting, and immediately helped study and solve problems when they found them.

In this large-scale inspection, two problems were generally found in various places: one was that a few pieces of land that could be planted with crops were not planted, and some cornfields that should have been intercropped were not intercropped; the other was that there were still a small amount of planted fields that were not well managed, with insufficient base fertilizer, resulting in a batch of third-class seedlings. According to the problems found in the inspection, all localities put forward the slogan of "inserting needles in cracks" and organized forces to rush to expand and intercrop. All counties in the Bijie Special District adopted the method of assigning personnel, determining quantity, determining quality, and determining time to comprehensively carry out the "small spring planting" movement. Up to now, the entire district has expanded the planting of approximately 300,000 mu of crops beside villages, roads, ditches, and field corners, and eliminated the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows on 2.4 million mu of land, and carried out intercropping on 3.1 million mu of land, basically realizing full planting and not wasting an inch of land.

For fields with sparse planting and insufficient base fertilizer, and for third-class seedlings, all localities are also actively topdressing and adding water to carry out the activity of "making late seedlings catch up with early seedlings and weak seedlings catch up with strong seedlings."

    安徽贵州深入细致进行检查评比
    六级干部会师田间促进夏种
    多种种足种好思想深入人心　扩种补种套种行动形成热潮
    本报合肥7日电　中共安徽省各级党委狠抓夏种最后时期，坚决保证完成和超额完成夏种任务，认真贯彻以农业为基础的方针。
    目前，全省各级领导干部和绝大部分公社社员，都投入了夏种工作的大检查、大评比运动。从省委到公社党委，各级负责人都亲自深入田间，进一步推动抢种扩种工作。芜湖专区有六万多生产大队以上的干部和群众一同生产，全专区的夏种任务已完成95％以上。蚌埠专区从地委直属机关抽调下乡的科局长以上干部，就占现在机关的同级干部总数的72％。阜阳、安庆、六安等地委，抽出了大批干部，成立检查组，由地委书记带领下乡，促进了夏种检查评比运动的全面展开。
    各级党委在发动群众性的夏种大检查大评比运动中，大力宣传以农业为基础的方针，宣传多种和种好的重大意义，使农业为基础的方针更加深入人心。同时，他们还在实际工作中，着重大抓后进地区和薄弱环节，带动群众实行边查边解决问题的办法，帮助没有完成夏种任务的地区加速完成任务。金寨县除全面组织五级干部会师田间，进行夏种检查评比以外，二十五个县委负责干部组成了检查团，巡回二百多华里，着重检查了边远地区和
  “死角”地区。如油店公社光明大队由于劳力和畜力不足，夏种任务完成的很差，他们便组织两个友邻大队支援二百多个劳动力和十五头耕牛，突击抢种，结果光明大队很快按质按量完成了夏种任务。在检查中，他们还发现白大公社眼前薄地栽的稀，田间管理未跟上，便帮助他们积极安排了五百多劳动力，一天补苗九百一十亩，引水灌田一千一百二十亩。中共天长县委第一书记戴尔珍在秦仁公社干桥生产队参加生产，发现这个队劳力安排不当，用在抢种上的劳力还不到30％，进度很慢，他就帮助这个队集中了80％的劳力突击抢种，大改工具，使夏种进度加快了近三倍。肥东县还抽出五百二十六个干部，深入到后进地区安家落户，一边抓夏种，一边抓管理。
    在已完成了夏种计划的地区，通过大检查、大评比，普遍掀起了扩种热潮。宁国县采取“三上山”
  （玉米、芝麻、大豆上山）的措施，每天有两万多人投入扩种活动，现在夏玉米的种植面积已扩大了51％。无为县在完成夏种任务后，又进行了查“白”补“白”，继续利用每一寸土地扩大夏种面积，不到几天全县就扩种作物十六万多亩。已经完成了油料作物夏种任务的六安专区，利用空隙地和间种套种的办法，扩大芝麻、黄豆、花生的种植，仅据寿县、金寨、庐江、六安等四个县的统计，就已扩种了油料作物二十三万七千多亩。
    新华社贵阳7日电　贵州省各级党组织集中精力大抓农业生产。省、专区、县、社、管理区和生产队的六级干部，在各级党委书记率领下会师田间，领导广大社员，深入细致地开展了以检查播种面积、播种质量和禾苗成长情况为主要内容的生产大检查。通过检查，目前全省各地已经掀起了扩种、补种、套种和中耕追肥的热潮。
    这次大检查，规模浩大。仅安顺、毕节、黔南和铜仁四个地区，参加检查的各级干部即达六万多名。为了避免因开展大规模的检查活动，减弱生产第一线的力量，各地采取了县不离县，社不离社，队不离队，参加检查后立即归队的办法。
    这次生产大检查比以往任何一次都做得更加深入、踏实、细致、全面。既查中心地区，又查边沿地区；既查先进地区，又查后进地区；既查水田，又查旱地；既查丰产坝，又查边远地；既查粮食作物，又查经济作物。检查人员一般都一面参加生产，一面检查，发现问题，立即帮助研究解决。
    在这次大检查中，各地普遍发现两个问题：一个是少数可以种植农作物的土地没有种上，有些该套种的玉米地没有套种；一个是还有少量的已种田地，管理不好，底肥不足，出现了一批三类苗。根据检查中发现的问题，各地提出了“见缝插针”的口号，都组织力量突击扩种、套种。毕节专区各县采取定人员、定数量、定质量、定时间的办法，全面开展了“小春播”运动。到目前为止，全区已在村旁、路旁、渠旁和田边地角等地扩种了约三十万亩农作物，并在二百四十万亩土地上消灭了缺窝断行现象，在三百一十万亩土地上进行了套种间作，基本上实现了满栽满插，寸土不荒。
    对种植较稀、底肥不足的田地和三类苗，各地也积极追肥、添水大搞“晚苗赶早苗，弱苗赶壮苗”的禾苗升级活动。（附图片）
