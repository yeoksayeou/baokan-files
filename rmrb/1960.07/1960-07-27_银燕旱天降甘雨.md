    Silver Swallow Brings Sweet Rain in Drought
    Hu Bian
    One day, the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory's weather forecast was "sunny to partly cloudy during the day." However, at noon, the Jiangwan area suddenly experienced torrential rain, and Baoshan, Hongkou, Wusong and other places also had rain. Was the Meteorological Observatory's forecast inaccurate? No, it turned out that the air force stationed in Shanghai had carried out artificial rainfall to support the suburban areas in fighting the drought.
    Prior to this, a unit of the air force stationed in Shanghai, under the instructions of the unit's Party committee, had equipped aircraft with experimental artificial rainfall equipment. After three test flights, they had achieved initial success. At noon that day, a cumulonimbus cloud appeared in the sky, and a few small raindrops fell, seemingly about to drift away. At this moment, this air force unit received an order from its superiors: immediately seize the opportunity to carry out artificial rainfall. Captain Wang Shuming, upon receiving the order, immediately put down his bowl and chopsticks and prepared to take off himself.
    At the airport, meteorological soldiers and ground crew had already braved temperatures above thirty-seven degrees Celsius and completed all preparations in a combat-ready posture.
    At 12:47, the Silver Swallow took off with the earnest expectations of all ground personnel and immediately plunged into the dark clouds. Unstable air currents shook the aircraft, and the Silver Swallow began to bump. Wang Shuming knew clearly that flying in such a large mass of charged and turbulent cumulonimbus clouds was very dangerous. However, in order to force the cloud to rain, it was necessary to spray the agent into the cloud. Therefore, he cleverly inserted one wing of the Silver Swallow into the cloud, while keeping the fuselage outside the cloud, and made maneuvering flights along the edge of the cloud. The agent was quickly sprayed, and the cloud immediately churned. Due to the effect of the agent, the cloud became darker and denser, and the vertical movement became more intense. As the Silver Swallow turned to prepare for landing, torrential rain began to fall on the long-thirsty seedlings, and the comrades waiting for the plane at the airport were also drenched.
    According to a report from the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau: this artificial rainfall experiment was initially successful. Rain fell in the areas passed by the cloud—Jiangwan, Baoshan, Hongkou, Wusong, and other places. The Jiangwan area, which had the heaviest rainfall, received more than thirty millimeters, and the showers continued for two hours and forty-eight minutes.
    When the welcome rain fell, the farmers in Baoshan and Wusong rejoiced and were even more confident in fighting the drought.

    银燕旱天降甘雨
    胡边
    一天，上海气象台的天气预报是“白天晴到少云”。可是中午，江湾地区忽然大雨倾盆，宝山、虹口、吴淞等地也都落了雨。是气象台的预报不准确吗？不，原来这是驻沪空军为支援郊区抗旱而施行了人工降雨。
    在这以前，驻沪空军某部在部队党委的指示下，用飞机加装试验人工降雨设备，经过三次试飞，已初步成功。这天中午，天空出现一块积云，落了几颗不大的雨点，眼看就要飘过去了。这时，这支空军部队接到上级的命令：立即抓紧时机，施行人工降雨。队长王书明接到命令，马上放下碗筷，准备亲自起飞。
    机场上，气象战士和地勤战士们早就冒着三十七度以上的高温，以战斗姿态完成了一切准备工作。
    十二时四十七分，银燕带着全体地面人员的殷切期望起飞了，它随即钻进了乌黑的云层。不稳定的气流震荡着飞机，银燕开始颠簸起来。王书明清楚地知道，在这样大量带电和动荡不定的积云里飞行，有很大危险。可是为了逼使云层降雨，必须把药剂喷入云层。于是他机智地将银燕的一个翅膀插进云里，而将机身留在云外，沿着云边作机动飞行。药剂很快地就喷洒完毕，云层立即翻腾起来。由于药剂的作用，云层变得更黑更浓了，垂直运动更加猛烈。当银燕转身准备着陆的时候，倾盆大雨开始洒落到久渴的禾苗上，机场上等候飞机的同志们也都被浇得浑身湿透。
    根据上海气象局的报告：这一次人工降雨试验，初步获得成功，在云层经过的地方——江湾、宝山、虹口、吴淞等地，都落了雨，雨量最大的江湾一带，达三十毫米以上，阵雨继续了两小时四十八分。
    当喜雨下降的时候，宝山、吴淞一带的农民欢欣鼓舞，更加增强了抗旱的信心。
