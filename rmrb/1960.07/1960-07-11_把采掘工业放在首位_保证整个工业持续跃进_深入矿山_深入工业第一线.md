    This newspaper reports from Nanjing on the 10th: Recently, under the leadership of Comrade Jia Shizhen, Standing Committee Member of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Mayor of Nanjing, heads of several bureaus and twenty industrial and mining enterprises in Nanjing went to Qinglongshan, Lingshan, Guantang, Longtan, Hushan, and other coal mines, going deep into the mines and among the masses to inspect and understand production and the living conditions of workers and help solve relevant problems.

    Leading comrades personally visited the coal mine sites, gaining a deeper understanding of the production situation of each mine. Leading cadres of various factories linked with the coal mines, by going down into the mines to understand the situation, not only further clarified the direction of support but also further clarified the necessity of supporting the technical transformation of coal mines, enhancing their determination and confidence in supporting the technical transformation of coal mines. Under the auspices of the responsible comrades of the competent bureaus, the relevant factories held symposiums with comrades from each mine to review the implementation of the factory-mine pairing support plan in the previous stage. Problems that could be solved immediately were resolved immediately; projects related to future technical transformation were also arranged immediately. Currently, it is the summer and rainy season, and there is an urgent need to further improve coal mine ventilation and drainage. Responsible comrades from the Materials Bureau and the Metallurgical Bureau organized relevant personnel to immediately clear warehouses, clearing out twenty water pumps and thirty blowers and other ventilation equipment to support the mines. Each paired factory also determined to support a portion of drainage and ventilation equipment and send technicians and cadres to the mines to be responsible for assisting in installation. The factories also helped the coal mines solve some hoisting equipment and electric drills for tunneling. Based on the weak maintenance capacity of the coal mines, each factory took responsibility separately, helping the coal mines quickly establish small "universal machine repair workshops" including forging, casting, turning, fitting, milling, and planing, and training technicians on their behalf. Each factory also sent personnel to reside in the mines, helping with work on the one hand and drafting more specific plans to support the technical transformation of coal mines on the other.

    After leading cadres from various departments and factories arrived at the coal mines, they found that some problems could not be solved immediately by one department or one unit, so they carried out collaboration on the spot to solve them. For example, some newly added equipment and building materials for the mines needed to be transported to the construction site immediately. The relevant factories of the Urban Construction Bureau and the Mechanical and Electrical Bureau could not completely solve this problem, so the Transportation Bureau tried every means to organize transportation forces to provide support. In less than ten days, they transported 320,000 bricks, and large quantities of yellow sand, wood, and equipment are also being rushed for transport.

    In terms of improving the lives of coal mine workers, in addition to mobilizing the masses and relying on their own efforts, relevant departments and factories also tried their best to help solve some problems. The Health Bureau decided to transfer a group of medical personnel from various urban areas to help each mine conduct physical examinations of workers in the near future. The Commercial Bureau organized relevant districts, communes, and coal mines to pair up, helping each mine solve the supply of some vegetables and other non-staple foods and increasing the supply of some daily necessities.

    The help and support of the leaders of the Municipal Party Committee and fraternal factories greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of coal mine workers. Under the slogan of "Overcoming Unfavorable Factors and Turning the Low-Production Season into a High-Production Season," they quickly launched a new upsurge in production. On July 1, the city's daily coal output increased by a full double compared to the average daily output of the previous month.

    This newspaper reports from Changsha on the 10th: Xiangtan Special District in Hunan Province persists in indigenous methods, launching a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on iron ore mining, so that the district's ore production rises month by month, continuing to leap forward.

    Most of the iron mines in the Xiangtan area were established in 1958. The entire production process of ore is mostly manual operation, which cannot meet the needs of high-speed development of iron smelting. The Xiangtan Prefectural Party Committee believes that the mining industry must be developed first to ensure the continuous leap forward in pig iron production. Since the beginning of this year, the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Party Committee in charge of industry have frequently gone deep into the iron mines to guide the technical transformation of the mines, and have designated special personnel to be responsible for specific leadership. Each iron plant has established a leading organization for the technical transformation of mines, and according to the principle of "overall transformation, focusing on key improvements," has formulated mine transformation plans at all levels, proceeding in batches and items. Up to now, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the thirteen iron mines in the district has increased to 62.5%, which has greatly accelerated the progress of ore mining, and ore production has increased month by month. The average daily output in May increased by 16.4% compared with April, and the average daily output in June increased by another 21.7% compared with May, which not only met the needs of pig iron production but also stored enough iron ore for iron plants to use for more than two months.

    In the technical transformation of mines, the principle of adhering to indigenous methods, vigorously carrying out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and highlighting the key of mining, carrying out the elimination of manual digging, vigorously carrying out high-efficiency blasting, and accelerating the mining footage. In the past few months, the district has created and imitated more than 330 sets of indigenous and foreign drilling machines, making it possible to realize the mechanization of drilling blast holes. The district has also universally implemented "five changes" in tunnels, that is, changing small lanes into large lanes, short lanes into high lanes, curved lanes into straight lanes, steep lanes into inclined slopes, single-eyed tunnels into double-eyed tunnels, and increasing ventilation equipment, creating favorable conditions for the use of new tools and the implementation of rapid blasting underground. While vigorously carrying out the mining technical revolution, the mines have also universally promoted the organization of tunneling professional teams, no longer just temporarily transferring people to tunneling, thus making tunneling more planned. Some iron mines have also promoted four-eight staggered operations, overcoming the phenomenon of idle waste.

    In terms of underground and surface transportation, the district has launched a mass movement to make mine shafts winches, build cableways on mountains, and lay tracks on the flat ground. In the past few months, the iron mines have laid nearly 70 kilometers of iron and wood tracks, erected more than 10,000 meters of cableways, and more than 130 automatic chutes, realizing the "one-dragon" indigenous mechanized transportation from the mine to the furnace side, from ore crushing to ore dressing. According to statistics from four iron mines such as Luanshan and Zhujipo, nearly 3,000 transportation laborers have been saved, and the transportation efficiency has also doubled.

    When Xiangtan area is vigorously carrying out the technical transformation of mines, it pays special attention to adhering to the principle of ideological mobilization first, and earnestly and seriously criticizes various conservative ideas of waiting for foreign aid and relying on big and foreign things, ensuring the rapid and sustained development of the movement. Ningxiang Zhujipo Iron Mine, cast more than 200 tons of rails by themselves, used self-made indigenous steel to manufacture more than 500 mechanical parts, and found wood by themselves to make more than 200 sets of new machines and tools such as indigenous winches, indigenous mine cars, drilling machines, washing machines, and belt conveyors. They also made full use of hydraulic washing and animal-powered transportation. They did not ask the higher authorities for a single machine or equipment, and realized the "one-dragon" indigenous mechanization from mining to surface transportation, from roasting to beneficiation into the furnace.

　　把采掘工业放在首位　保证整个工业持续跃进
　　深入矿山——深入工业第一线
　　南京市委和各部门、厂矿负责人到煤矿井下检查工作解决问题
　　湖南湘潭专区加速铁矿技术改造保证了高炉吃饱有余
    本报南京10日电　南京市几个局和二十个工矿企业的负责人，最近在中共南京市委常委、南京市副市长贾世珍同志的率领下，前往青龙山、灵山、官塘、龙潭、湖山等煤矿，深入井下、深入群众，检查与了解生产和职工生活情况，帮助解决有关问题。
    负责同志亲临煤矿现场，对各矿生产情况有了更加深入地了解，与煤矿挂钩的各工厂领导干部，通过下井了解情况，不仅进一步明确了支援方向，而且进一步明确了支援煤矿技术改造的必要性，增强了支援煤矿技术改造的决心和信心。各有关工厂在主管局负责同志的主持下，都分别和各矿同志举行了座谈会，检查了前一阶段厂矿挂钩支援计划的执行情况，对于一些马上可以解决的问题，立即解决；有关今后技术改造的项目，也马上作了安排。当前是暑期和雨季，急需进一步改善煤井通风和排水问题，物资局和冶金局负责同志就组织有关人员立即清理仓库，清出二十台水泵和三十台鼓风机等通风设备，支援矿山。各挂钩工厂也确定支援一部分排水、通风设备，并派技术工人、干部到矿山负责协助安装。各厂还帮助煤矿解决一部分提升设备和掘进用的电钻等设备。根据煤矿机修力量薄弱的情况，各厂分头负责，帮助煤矿迅速建立包括有锻铸和车、钳、铣、刨各工种的小型“万能机修车间”，并代为培训技术人员。各厂还派人驻矿，一面帮助工作，一面拟定更加具体的支援煤矿技术改造的计划。
    各部门和工厂领导干部到煤矿后，发现有些问题不是一个部门、一个单位能够马上解决的，就在现场开展协作加以解决。如各煤矿有一批新增设备和建井的材料需要马上运到工地，城建局、机电局有关工厂不能完全解决这一问题，交通局就千方百计组织运输力量予以支援，不到十天时间，就运去了三十二万块砖，大批黄砂、木材、设备等也正在赶运中。
    在改善煤矿职工生活方面，各矿除发动群众、自力更生以外，有关部门和工厂也尽力帮助解决一些问题。卫生局决定从各城区抽调一批医务人员，在最近时间内帮助各矿检查职工身体。商业局则组织有关地区、公社和煤矿挂钩，帮助各矿解决一部分蔬菜等副食品的供应问题，并增加了一部分日用品的供应。
    市委领导同志和各兄弟工厂的帮助及支援，大大鼓舞了煤矿职工的干劲。他们在“克服不利因素，变低产季节为高产季节”的口号下，迅速掀起了生产新高潮。7月1日全市煤炭日产量比上月平均日产量猛增一倍。
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省湘潭专区坚持土法上马，大闹以铁矿采掘为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，使全区矿石产量月月上升，持续跃进。
    湘潭地区铁矿大部分是1958年建立起来的，矿石的全部生产过程，大都是手工操作，满足不了炼铁高速度发展的需要。中共湘潭地委认为必须优先发展采掘工业，才能保证生铁生产不断跃进。今年以来，地委主管工业的负责同志，经常深入铁矿，指导矿山技术改造工作，并指定了专人经常负责具体领导。各铁厂都成立了矿山技术改造领导机构，根据“全面改造，重点提高”的原则，层层制定了矿山改造规划，分批分项进行。到目前止，全区十三个铁矿的机械化和半机械化程度已提高到62.5％，使矿石采掘进度大大加快，矿石产量逐月上升。5月份平均日产量比4月份上升了16.4％，6月份平均日产量又比5月份增加了21.7％，不但满足了生铁生产需要，而且还储备了足够铁厂使用两个多月的铁矿石。
    在矿山技术改造中，坚持土法上马，大搞技术革新和技术革命群众运动的原则，并且突出地抓住了采掘这一关键，开展消灭手掘，大搞高效爆破运动，加速采掘进尺。几个月来，全区创造和仿制了土洋打眼机械三百三十多部，使打炮眼基本上实现了打眼机械化。全区还普遍实行了窿道“五改”，即小巷改大巷，矮巷改高巷，弯巷改直巷，陡巷改斜坡，独眼窿改双眼窿，以及增设通风设备，为井下使用新工具和实行快速爆破创造了有利条件。在大搞采掘技术革命的同时，各矿还普遍推广了掘进专业队组织，不再只是临时调人掘进，因而使掘进更有计划的安排。有的铁矿还推广四八交叉作业，克服了窝工浪费现象。
    在井下和地面运输方面，全区掀起了井巷绞车化，依山架索道，平地铺轨道的群众运动。几个月来，各铁矿铺设了铁木轨道近七十公里，架设索道一万多米，自动溜槽一百三十多处，实现了从矿井到炉边，从碎矿到选矿“一条龙”土机械化运输，据鸾山、竹鸡坡等四个铁矿的统计，就节约了近三千个运输劳力，运输工效还提高一倍。
    湘潭地区在大搞矿山技术改造的时候，特别注意坚持思想发动为先的原则，认真严肃的批判了各种等洋求大、两眼向上的保守思想，保证了运动迅速持续发展。宁乡竹鸡坡铁矿，自己动手铸造了二百多吨铁轨，用自造的土钢制造了五百多个机械零件，自己找木材制出了土绞车、土矿车、打眼机、淘洗机、皮带运输机等新机具二百多件，还充分利用水力洗矿，畜力运输。他们没有向上级要一台机器设备，就实现了从开采到地面运输，从焙烧到精选入炉“一条龙”土机械化。
