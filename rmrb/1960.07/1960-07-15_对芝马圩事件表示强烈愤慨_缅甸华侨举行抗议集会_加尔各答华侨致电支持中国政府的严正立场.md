Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 13th: Overseas Chinese in Burma have been holding rallies and issuing statements in recent days, expressing strong indignation at the atrocities committed by the West Java military authorities in killing overseas Chinese women, and firmly supporting the solemn protest lodged by Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, with the Indonesian government.

The Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Xing Shang General Association, the Retailers' Association, and the Burmese Chinese Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association held a joint conference on the evening of July 10th to express their strong protest against the Zhima Market massacre. Twenty-two representatives from these four groups spoke at the meeting, firmly supporting Ambassador Huang Zhen's protest to the Indonesian government, demanding an end to the forced relocation, punishment of the murderers, compensation for the bereaved families, immediate release of the arrested overseas Chinese, guarantees that such incidents will not happen again, and a public apology.

Xu Siming, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, pointed out in his speech that the killing of two Indonesian Chinese women was not an isolated incident. He said that this was part of an anti-China campaign deliberately carried out by forces hostile to friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

The meeting unanimously agreed to send a telegram in the name of the four Burmese Chinese groups to the Indonesian Federation of Chinese Associations, expressing their strong anger and protest against this atrocity, and expressing sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims.

More than 500 representatives from the cultural and educational circles of the Burmese Chinese community held a similar protest rally on the evening of July 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 13th: The families of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, the overseas Chinese women recently killed in the Zhima Market massacre, received a telegram of condolence on July 12th from all the overseas Chinese in Calcutta, India. The telegram expressed condemnation and protest against the crimes of the West Java military authorities in Indonesia in killing overseas Chinese Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang. The telegram also expressed firm support for the Chinese government's solemn stance on this issue.
