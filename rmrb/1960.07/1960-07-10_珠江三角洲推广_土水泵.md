    The Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong Province is promoting the "indigenous water pump" created by the Shengshi Brigade of the Shaxi Commune in Zhongshan County. This type of indigenous water pump achieves about 70% of the mechanical efficiency of a foreign-made water pump, but it is simple to manufacture and costs only about one-seventh as much.
    The indigenous water pump created by the Shengshi Brigade of the Shaxi Commune in Zhongshan County uses red bricks and cement to build the outer shell of the water pump. A propeller with an iron shaft and ball bearings is installed inside the shell as the pumping mechanism. It took four days and four nights to build an indigenous water pump with a diameter of 400 millimeters. This indigenous water pump, driven by a 7.5-horsepower electric motor, solved the irrigation water problem for 800 mu of upland fields in two days and two nights, which is equivalent to the water hauling capacity of 350 laborers. The mechanical efficiency of this type of indigenous water pump is about 70% of that of a foreign-made water pump. Manufacturing a foreign-made water pump with a diameter of 900 millimeters to 1,000 millimeters costs about 14,000 yuan, while building an indigenous water pump only costs more than 2,000 yuan. The indigenous water pump has a simple structure, and ordinary masons and carpenters can build it after learning it once, so there are conditions for launching a mass movement on a large scale.
    The fertile land of the Pearl River Delta is divided into pieces by crisscrossing rivers and streams, surrounded by water on all sides. In order to resist floods, many rice paddies here have levees built along the rivers. However, during the flood season every summer, floods outside the levees rise sharply, and waterlogging inside the levees cannot be drained; when drought occurs, the river water level drops, and water needs to be pumped into the levees for irrigation. Therefore, many places need to build mechanical pumping stations to pump water for drainage and irrigation in order to fundamentally solve water conservancy problems. This year, fourteen counties and cities in the Pearl River Delta will establish an electric pumping and irrigation network. The first phase of the project requires 548 large water pumps with diameters ranging from 500 millimeters to 1,200 millimeters. At present, various counties are promoting the indigenous water pump created by Zhongshan County, which will accelerate the construction of the electric pumping and irrigation network.

### 珠江三角洲推广“土水泵”

    珠江三角洲推广“土水泵”
    本报讯　广东省珠江三角洲一带河网地区，正在推广中山县沙溪公社圣狮大队创制的土水泵。这种土水泵达到洋水泵的机械效能的70％左右，而制造简单，成本仅及洋水泵的七分之一左右。
    中山县沙溪公社圣狮大队创制的土水泵，用红砖、水泥来砌结水泵外壳，在外壳中安装上一个铁轴、滚珠轴承的螺旋桨作抽水机械，花了四天四夜时间，便建成了一座四百毫米口径的土水泵。这座土水泵用七点五马力的电动机带动，两天两夜时间，便解决了八百亩高田的灌溉用水，等于三百五十个劳动力的车水量。这种土水泵的机械效率等于洋水泵的70％左右。制造九百毫米至一千毫米口径的洋水泵，需要一万四千元左右，而建造土水泵只用二千多元。土水泵构造简单，一般的泥水匠、木匠学过一遍，都会建造，因此有条件大搞群众运动。
    珠江三角洲肥沃的土地，被纵横交错的河涌分割成一片片，四面环水。为抗御洪水淹没，这里许多稻田都沿河建筑堤围。但是，每年夏季汛期，围外洪水暴涨，围内渍水不得渲泄；遇到抗旱，河水低落，又需要抽水进围灌溉。因此，许多地方需要建设机械排灌站，抽水排涝、灌溉，才能根本解决水利问题。今年珠江三角洲的十四个县市要建立一个电动排灌网。第一期工程就要五百毫米至一千二百毫米口径的大型水泵五百四十八台。目前各县推广中山县创造的土水泵，将会加速电动排灌网的建设。
