Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Yunnan, Qinghai, Guangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Shandong vast masses of people try every means to grow and store vegetables

Xinhua News Agency reported that more than 100,000 public canteens in Yunnan Province have adopted a method of combining good basic vegetable plots with utilizing scattered plots to intensively plant vegetables. At present, more than 70% of the canteens in the province can provide each person with more than one jin of vegetables per day.

People's communes throughout the province have selected places with good soil quality, good water and fertilizer conditions, and close proximity to the canteens to establish vegetable production bases at a ratio of one mu per ten to fifteen people. More than 1.2 million mu of basic vegetable plots have been planted throughout the province. In order to plant and manage the basic vegetable plots well, canteens in various places have selected three to five experienced poor and lower-middle peasants to manage them specifically and have universally promoted the responsibility system. All basic vegetable plots arrange tall and short plants, and intercrop and interplant varieties with long and short growing periods, according to the characteristics of various vegetable varieties, to increase the yield per unit area.

While planting and managing basic vegetable plots well, public canteens throughout the province are taking advantage of the favorable opportunity of abundant rainfall and high temperatures to utilize all available vacant land to intensively plant melons, vegetables, and beans, and intercrop vegetables in some grain fields. According to preliminary statistics, various places in the province have already used fields, houses, river banks, ditch edges, and barren hills and wastelands to plant more than 440 million tang of various melons, beans, and vegetables.

Xinhua News Agency reported that Qinghai Province has planted more than 400,000 mu of various vegetables this year, exceeding the annual vegetable sowing plan by 21%. The sowing area has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. The varieties have also increased by more than 30 compared to last year. Now, various places are simultaneously harvesting summer vegetables, planting autumn vegetables, and carrying out field management, while also storing vegetables, striving to plant more, harvest more, and store more.

Leaders at all levels in Qinghai Province and departments such as agriculture and commerce attach great importance to vegetable production. Many people's communes have universally established vegetable production bases and comprehensively arranged the production of commercial vegetables and self-sufficient vegetables. Agencies, factories, mines, schools, and troops have also universally developed self-sufficient vegetable production, and many units have already achieved vegetable self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency.

Xinhua News Agency reported that Guangxi has made full use of wasteland and marginal land to plant vegetables, and the entire autonomous region has planted more than 1.97 million mu of various vegetables this year. In many rural people's communes in Nanning Prefecture, each person can eat more than one jin of vegetables per day.

People's communes in various places not only extensively expanded vegetable planting by utilizing every available space, but also made comprehensive arrangements based on the planting season of various vegetables and the length of their growing periods, as well as early and late maturity characteristics, planting them seasonally and monthly. They generally reserve some vacant land to plant new vegetables, or intercrop new vegetables in late-maturing fields, to ensure that members have vegetables to eat all year round.

This newspaper reported that in Anhui Province, counties such as Tianchang, Jinzhai, Fengyang, Taihu, Lingbi, Feixi, Feidong, and Wuhe reasonably arranged labor and animal power, taking advantage of the moisture to rush to plant vegetables, planting and managing simultaneously, striving for a bumper harvest of summer vegetables.

Shiliang Commune in Tianchang County used vacant land to plant more than 9,000 mu of melons and vegetables, totaling more than 17,000 mu together with the previously planted area, exceeding the summer vegetable planting task by more than 40%. The county party committee and the commune party committee secretaries of Jinzhai County personally led the members to plant summer vegetables in the rain, planting more than 40,000 mu of vegetables in three days, doubling the daily progress compared to before.

In the rush to plant summer vegetables, various places have attached great importance to quality, ensuring that they plant more and plant well. In Fengyang County, more than 37,600 mu of summer vegetable land has water and fertilizer, realizing water source management. All 5,669 mu of summer vegetables already planted by Lingcheng Commune in Lingbi County have been made into ridge fields.

In the movement to grow summer vegetables on a large scale, in accordance with the spirit of "plant more and harvest more, high yield and more harvest," people's communes and production teams have established vegetable bases and vigorously carried out melon and vegetable intercropping and interplanting in grain fields. The vast numbers of members have also made full use of both sides of river embankments, in front of and behind houses, and edges of fields to grow "ten edges" extensively, increasing the multiple cropping index and expanding the planting area. In Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and other prefectures, in addition to cleverly planting various vegetables in large fields, they also planted more than 1.2 million mu of various melons and vegetables on scattered lands such as roadsides and fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th, reported that people's communes, agencies, factories, mines, and schools in Shanxi Province took advantage of the good opportunity after the rain to launch a movement for everyone to plant vegetables.

According to the current drought situation, it was proposed to concentrate leadership and all human and material resources to carry out a massive drought resistance and seedling protection campaign, and to engage in mass autumn vegetable production on a large scale. After the rainfall, various places more rapidly launched a movement to rush to plant vegetables.

　　抓紧夏季有利时机掀起大种瓜菜高潮
　　云南青海广西安徽江苏山西山东广大群众千方百计种菜储菜
    据新华社讯　云南省十多万个公共食堂采取种好基本菜地与利用零星地突击栽种相结合的办法，种植大量蔬菜。目前，全省有70％以上的食堂，每人每天可吃到一斤多蔬菜。
    全省各地人民公社都选择土质好、水肥条件好、距食堂较近的地方，按照每十人至十五人一亩的比例，建立蔬菜生产基地。全省已种植基本菜地一百二十多万亩。为了种好管好基本菜地，各地食堂都选拔三、五个有种菜经验的贫农、下中农专门管理，并且普遍推行责任制度。各基本菜地都根据各种蔬菜品种的特性，安排高棵与矮棵、生长期长与生长期短的品种间种套种，增加单位面积产量。
    在种好管好基本菜地的同时，全省各公共食堂正趁雨量充沛、气温较高的有利时机，利用一切可以利用的空闲地见缝插针，大种特种瓜、菜、豆类，并在一部分粮食地里间种蔬菜。据初步统计，全省各地已经利用田边、房前屋后、河岸沟边和荒山荒地种下各种瓜、豆、蔬菜四亿四千多万塘。
    据新华社讯　青海省今年已种植各种蔬菜四十多万亩，超额21％完成了全年蔬菜播种计划。播种面积比去年同期增长一倍多。品种也比去年增加三十多种。现在各地正在一面收夏菜、种秋菜和进行田间管理，一面储备蔬菜，力争多种、多收、多储备。
    青海省各级领导和农业、商业等部门都非常重视蔬菜生产。许多人民公社普遍建立了蔬菜生产基地，全面安排商品菜和自给菜的生产。机关、厂矿、学校、部队也普遍发展自给性的蔬菜生产，有不少单位已经达到蔬菜自给或基本自给。
    据新华社讯　广西各地充分利用荒地、边地种植蔬菜，今年全自治区已种各种蔬菜一百九十七万多亩。南宁专区很多农村人民公社食堂每人每天已能吃到蔬菜一斤以上。
    各地人民公社不但见缝插针地大量扩种蔬菜，而且根据各种蔬菜的种植季节和生长期长短，早熟与迟熟等特点，全面安排，分季分月地种植，一般都留部分空地种植新菜，或在迟熟地里套种新菜，保证社员常年有菜吃。
    本报讯　安徽省天长、金寨、凤阳、太湖、灵壁、肥西、肥东、五河等县，合理安排劳力、畜力，趁墒抢栽抢种蔬菜，边栽种边管理，力争夏菜大丰收。
    天长县石梁公社利用空隙地种瓜菜九千多亩，连同过去种的共达一万七千多亩，超额40％以上完成了夏菜种植任务。金寨县县委和各公社党委书记亲自带领社员，冒雨抢栽夏菜，三天种菜四万多亩，日进度较前加快两倍多。
    各地在抢种夏菜中，都非常重视质量，保证多种、种好。凤阳县有三万七千六百多亩夏菜地有水有肥，实现了水源化。灵壁县灵城公社已种的五千六百六十九亩夏菜，全部实现了畦田化。
    本报南京11日电　江苏省各人民公社，像抓粮食一样狠抓夏季瓜菜生产。目前，全省已播种、移栽各种瓜菜二百七十八万二千多亩。
    在大种夏季蔬菜运动中，根据“多种多收，高产多收”的精神，各人民公社，生产队都建立了蔬菜基地，并在粮田里大搞瓜菜套种、间种。广大社员还充分利用河堤两边，家前屋后，田头地角等大种“十边”，提高复种指数，扩大播种面积。徐州、淮阴等专区，除在大田巧种各样蔬菜外，还寻缝插针，在路边、场边等零星土地上种各种瓜菜一百二十多万亩。
    据新华社太原11日电　山西省各城乡人民公社、机关、厂矿、学校，趁雨后良机，掀起人人动手抢种蔬菜运动。
    6月底，中共山西省委召开了省委扩大会议，以农业为基础部署了当前的农业生产。根据当前干旱情况，提出集中领导力量和一切人力物力，开展声势浩大的抗旱保苗，并大搞群众性的秋菜生产。各地在降雨后，更加迅速地掀起抢种蔬菜运动。
    旱象最严重的晋北专区，7月5日大部地区降喜雨，雨后，各级党委连夜部署，次日全区人民响应省委号召，在半天时间内就种菜八万多亩；晋中地区各级党委在雨后立即组织干部深入第一线，领导群众抢种。晋东南地区，普遍降雨之后，仅仅两天全区就种菜十四万余亩。太原全市各机关、厂矿、学校等单位，也掀起了一个人人动手种菜的高潮。
    本报济南11日电　山东广大青少年，抓紧时机，向“十边”挺进，大种瓜、菜、油料等成绩显著。
    山东自连续降雨以后，各级团组织领导广大青少年抓紧雨后时机，广泛开展了大种瓜、菜、油料、豆类的突击活动。济南地区的五十四万青少年，积极响应了团济南市委“每人千斤瓜菜”的号召，开展了种满“三线”（铁路、公路、渠道沿线）、“十个边”的活动，连战七天，扩大种植面积九万九千一百多亩。新泰县龙廷公社的一百五十六个增种突击队，将总面积四百多亩的场园，全部种上了生长期较短的瓜菜。胶东半岛的烟台地区的二百万青少年，大种瓜、菜、油料、豆类的活动，如火如荼。牟平八万多名青年，经过短时间的突击，种植各种瓜菜二千八百多亩，豆类五千五百多亩。（附图片）
