　　Qinghai Transportation Front Launches "Learn From, Catch Up With" Liu Xinguo Campaign
　　Xining, July 17 (By Our Newspaper) — The broad masses of workers on the Qinghai Province highway transportation front, in deeply developing the "safety, economy, ten thousand ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month" movement, have launched a competition upsurge of "learning from, catching up with, and surpassing" Liu Xinguo, and a large number of "Liu Xinguo-style" heroic figures have emerged, resulting in a new situation of comprehensive, stable, and continuous improvement in the province's highway transportation efficiency.
　　Liu Xinguo is a heroic driver from the Qaidam Transportation Bureau of Qinghai Province. In the competition of "learning from Liu Xinguo, catching up with Liu Xinguo, and surpassing Liu Xinguo," highway transportation units have generally adopted methods of planting red flags and establishing pace-setters on a large scale, forming a situation of mutual pursuit and mutual promotion, with a large number of heroic figures emerging. In May, more than 260 advanced collectives emerged in the province's highway transportation departments, and 54 "Liu Xinguo-style" drivers appeared in the Qaidam Transportation Bureau, each breaking through 10,000 to 50,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month.
　　The in-depth development of the Learn From, Catch Up With, and Surpass Liu Xinguo movement has prompted the broad masses of highway transportation workers to work hard and cleverly, closely integrating technological innovation and production, tapping the potential of vehicles and equipment, carrying out large-scale machinery reforms, and vigorously improving transportation organization. Since the beginning of this year, workers on the province's highway transportation front have put forward more than 70,000 innovation proposals in this regard, and more than 14,000 have been adopted and put into production, effectively promoting highway transportation and production efficiency.
　　The Learn From, Catch Up With, and Surpass Liu Xinguo movement has gone beyond the scope of drivers and assistant personnel and has been widely carried out in all aspects such as automobile repair, highway maintenance, and administrative management. Many automobile repair factories (yards) workers are actively learning Liu Xinguo's communist style of selfless labor, doing everything possible to tap potential and find clever ways, and have realized their goal of "no repairs exceeding one day, minor repairs not overnight, and maintenance on time."
　　It was a summer evening, not far from Dunhuang City, when I met Liu Xinguo, a national advanced producer and a pace-setter on the Qinghai Province transportation front. He is in his twenties, of medium height, with nimble hands and feet, and you can tell at a glance that he is a shrewd and capable young man. Getting into the car, you can see that his starting, shifting, braking, and passing are all so organized, skilled, and steady. He drives a car with a large trailer or a semi-trailer, passing through the sandy desert and over the winding mountain roads. Like in our Great Leap Forward era, since 1958, he has completed several years' worth of mileage every year. This year, he has successively created excellent results of 30,000, 50,000, and 100,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month, becoming a red flag on the Qinghai Province highway transportation front.
　　The road of a hero is not smooth. In the spring of 1955, eighteen-year-old Liu Xinguo made a grand ambition to come to Qinghai from his hometown of Henan to participate in socialist construction. However, after he graduated from the Xining Motor Vehicle Driver Training Class, the first time he followed the car to Lhasa via the Tanggula Mountain, the "Roof of the World," the car broke down. This is a world of ice and snow.
　　Liu Xinguo was hungry, and his frostbitten hands ached like they were on fire. Listening to the howling cold wind outside the car window, he couldn't restrain his emotions for the first time and burst into tears. Just then, he seemed to hear a voice ringing in his ears: "Xinguo! There will certainly be many difficulties over there, but difficulties are like a mountain, and you have to overthrow it. As long as you listen to the Party, you will become strong." This was a farewell message from an old Communist Party member. This old man was none other than Liu Xinguo's father. His father's words also reminded him of his childhood of hardship. At that time, his father went out to join the Eighth Route Army, leaving him and his mother to live in hunger and cold. At that time, how much they hoped for national liberation! Now that the good days have come. Are these days easy to come by? Is encountering these temporary difficulties in developing the treasure trove of Qaidam more difficult than the suffering of the past? As soon as Liu Xinguo thought of this, he felt an unstoppable force all over his body. Early the next morning, he endured the hunger and cold and ran down the mountain to report the news.
　　In 1958, the Party's Great Leap Forward sounded its horn. At this time, the young heroic driver Liu Xinguo began to attract people's attention. He saw that the rich mineral resources of Qaidam could not be transported out, and the materials and daily necessities urgently needed for production could not be transported into the basin in time. He was really worried. The idea of "more hauling, faster running, both safe and economical" often lingered in his mind. Since then, whenever the car arrived at the station, the people in the restaurant were bustling with activity, and his companions warmly greeted him to eat with them, he always answered everyone's kindness with a smile, and then hurriedly bought two buns and went on the road. One night, he was traveling from Dachaidan to Xiadong in Gansu, and the snow water flowing down the mountain cut off road traffic. He and his assistant Liu Weisheng came to the river, and by the light of the car, they saw four or five cars stranded in the heart of the river, unable to move forward or backward. He thought, he had to find a way to get through. In this race against time, waiting here would be too time-consuming. Liu Weisheng saw him staring at the river in a daze and asked, "Master Liu, what should we do?" Liu Xinguo's eyes lit up and said, "Cross it!" They walked back and forth on the bank of the river, and finally found a place where the water was shallow, so they took the initiative to move stones into the water to pave the way. The ice water was piercingly cold, swirling and rolling on their legs, like two powerful hands trying to push them down hard. But they fought tenaciously for two hours and finally drove the car over.
　　When the task was urgent, Liu Xinguo's brain disease occurred, and sometimes he even fainted. He said to his assistant, "This is an old problem, it doesn't matter, but don't tell the captain!" Unexpectedly, the assistant reported it when he came back. The team sent him to the hospital that day. But Liu Xinguo saw that everyone else was in the Great Leap Forward, but he was lying in the hospital, and he felt very uncomfortable. He hid from the nurses several times and ran back to the team in the middle of the night to maintain the car he was driving.
　　After he recovered from his illness, the Party branch had several talks with Liu Xinguo, instructing him to pay attention to "working cleverly." From then on, Liu Xinguo's heart was tied to this. The team had a four-wheel trailer that two experienced masters were allowed to experiment with towing, but it failed. But this trailer attracted Liu Xinguo like a magnet. He asked the Party organization to allow him to experiment. The news spread, and some people whispered behind his back, "Even the experienced masters couldn't tow it, how dare he try! If he breaks the trailer, he'll lose his life!" Liu Xinguo ignored these comments and drove the trailer over the Dangjin Mountain, which is 4,000 meters above sea level, four times in a row. Although it ran slower, it could haul twice as much cargo. There was no problem in towing the trailer, but how could it run faster? He took the initiative to find technicians and experienced masters to study together. Aiming at the key problem that the trailer's steel plate was easy to break, he studied and modified the "auxiliary steel plate," which greatly improved the running time of the trailer. Although he was so busy with his work, he usually paid great attention to safety and vehicle maintenance. He knew that safety was the greatest saving, and that not going to the repair shop could win more time. Often when he came back from a trip, even if it was midnight, he would check the car before resting. The results of many trips proved that his car with the trailer was no slower than other single cars, and it took him the same three days to travel to and from Xitieshan as it did for others. From then on, Liu Xinguo's name spread throughout Qaidam.
　　In August 1959, Liu Xinguo first created a provincial record of 18,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month; in October of the same year, he gloriously attended the National Hero Conference. He will never forget that windy morning when all the staff of the Bureau beat gongs and drums to see him off, and pinned a bright red flower on his chest. He and the Secretary of the Qaidam Transportation Bureau Party Committee walked at the forefront of the team. At a moment of great excitement, the Party Committee Secretary earnestly said to him: "Always remember that we Communist Party members must be more modest when comrades are giving flowers and cheering. Without the Party and the masses, what can we do ourselves?..." Even now, these words are still in his mind. He also cannot forget the care and support of the Party and comrades. When he came back from a trip, the leaders personally went to the kitchen to ask the cooks to feed him well. In the middle of the night, as soon as they heard that there was something wrong with his car, the repair workers immediately got out of bed to help him repair it. Liu Xinguo thought: In the old society, people called drivers "stinky coachmen," and no one cared if you fell into a ten-thousand-foot cliff to feed tigers and wolves! But now, how does the Party care for us workers! Thinking of this, he couldn't lie down or sit still, so he ran to the car and thought about how to pull more and run faster? In March of this year, he and technicians Wang Wenfeng, Liu Huang and other comrades jointly created a new device, which greatly improved the traction of the car. How many cold nights did they lie under the car, unable to open their eyes from the night wind, and when they couldn't stand it, they lay down on the spot to rest and then continued to work. Miracles were created in this way. He and his partners also learned from the advanced experience of other provinces. On the Northwest Plateau, long-distance relay races and trains were implemented for the first time. A car could only tow four or five tons, but now it can tow more than sixty tons. How can this not be tortuous? Difficulties pushed back and forth, rushing towards them like waves! However, in the face of heroes, difficulties are just paper tigers. Their vehicle-ton-month production has been rising step by step, just like climbing a mountain with no summit. They are climbing hard, climbing, climbing, and the magnificent goal is waving to them!
　　I rode in Liu Xinguo's car from Dunhuang to Xiadong, and along the way, I heard comrades praise him. As dawn was breaking, the cold wind before dawn in the Gobi Desert was piercing, but the hearts of the speakers and listeners were warm. At this time, the morning star was shining on the horizon, and the train was rolling forward quickly in the hazy morning light. For a moment, I felt that Liu Xinguo was not driving his heroic car, but as if he was riding on the mighty east wind, and I really didn't know how high and far he would fly! (Attached picture)

　　青海运输战线掀起“学赶”刘新国运动
    本报西宁17日电　青海省公路运输战线上的广大职工，在深入开展“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动中，掀起了一个“学、赶、超”刘新国的竞赛高潮，涌现出大批“刘新国式”的英雄人物，使目前全省公路运输效率出现了全面稳定持续上升的新局面。
    刘新国是青海省柴达木交通局的英雄司机。在“学刘新国、赶刘新国、超刘新国”的竞赛中，由于公路运输单位普遍采取了大插红旗、广树标兵的办法，形成你追我赶、互相促进，英雄人物大批涌现。5月份，全省公路运输部门涌现出的先进集体就有二百六十多个，柴达木交通局出现“刘新国式”的司机有五十四名，他们分别突破车吨月产一万至五万吨公里以上。
    学赶超刘新国运动的深入开展，促使广大公路运输职工苦干加巧干，把技术革新和生产紧密结合起来，大挖车辆设备潜力，大搞机具改革，大力改进运输组织工作。今年来，全省公路运输战线上的职工共提出有关这方面的革新建议达七万多件，经采纳投入生产的有一万四千多件，有力地促进了公路运输和生产效率的提高。
    学赶超刘新国的运动，已经超出了司机和助理人员的范围，并在汽车修理、公路养护、行政管理等各方面普遍开展起来，许多汽车修理厂（场）的职工，积极学习刘新国忘我劳动的共产主义风格，千方百计地挖潜力、找窍门，实现了他们提出的“大修不过日，小修不过夜，保养不过时”的奋斗目标已经实现。
    这是一个夏天的傍晚，在敦煌城外不远的地方，我见到了全国先进生产者、青海省运输战线上的标兵刘新国。他二十多岁，中等身材，手脚麻利，一看就知道是个精明能干的小伙子。坐上车子，你看他起步、换挡、刹车、错车，都是那么有板有眼，熟练稳妥，就是他驾驶着挂有大拖车的汽车，或半拖挂汽车，驶过风沙飞扬的沙漠，翻过盘旋曲折的山路，像我们大跃进的时代一样，从1958年开始，每年都跑完数年的路程，今年又接连创造了车吨月产三万、五万、十万吨公里的优异成绩，成为青海省公路运输战线上的一面红旗。
    英雄的道路并不是平坦的。1955年春天，十八岁的刘新国立下了雄心大志，从家乡河南前来青海参加社会主义建设。然而，当他在西宁汽车驾驶员训练班结业后，第一次跟车去拉萨路经“世界屋脊”的唐古拉山时，车子抛了锚。这里正是冰雪茫茫的世界。
    刘新国肚子饿，冻伤了的双手痛得像火烧一样。他听着车窗外怒吼的寒风，第一次抑制不住自己的感情，失声哭了起来。就在这时，他仿佛听到一种声音在他耳边响着：“新国啊！到了那边，困难一定不少，可是困难像座山，也要把它掀掉，只要你听党的话，就会坚强起来的。”这是一个老共产党员给他的临别赠言。这位老人不是别人，正是刘新国的父亲。父亲的话还使他想起了灾难深重的童年。那时，父亲外出参加八路军，留下他和母亲过着饥寒交迫的生活。那时，他们多么盼望着全国解放啊！如今这个好日子来了。这样的日子难道来得容易吗？难道开发祖国的宝库柴达木，遇到这点暂时的困难，会比过去的苦难更重吗？刘新国一想到这些，浑身有股不可遏止的力量。第二天一早，他就忍着饥寒，跑到山下报信去了。
    1958年，党的大跃进的号角响了，就在这个时候，青年英雄司机刘新国开始引起了人们的注意。他看到柴达木丰富的矿产资源运不出来，生产急需的器材和生活用品又不能及时运进盆地。心里可真着急。“拉的多、跑的快，既安全、又节约”的思想，经常盘旋在他的脑子里。此后每当汽车驶到站上，饭馆里的人熙熙攘攘，伙伴们热情地招呼着拉他一起吃饭的时候，他总是笑着回答大家的盛情，然后急匆匆地买两个馒头又上路了。有一天夜里，他从大柴旦去甘肃峡东，山上淌下来的雪水，截断了公路交通。他和助手刘卫生来到河边，借着车灯，看见四、五个车子误在河心进退不得。他想，怎么也得想法过去。在这争分夺秒的时刻，蹲在这里等待，太误事了。刘卫生见他眼睛瞅着河水发楞，就问：“刘师傅，咋办哩？”刘新国眼睛一亮说：“过”！他们在河岸上走过去，走过来，终于发现有一处水量较浅，就自己动手搬石头下水垫路。冰水钻心透骨，在他们腿上打漩、翻滚，就像两支有力的手要使劲地推倒他们似的。但是他们顽强地战斗了两个小时，终于把车子开过去了。
    正当任务紧急的时候，刘新国的脑病犯了，有时甚至要昏厥过去。他对助手说：“这是老毛病，不碍事，你可别告诉队长！”没想到助手回来就汇报了。队上当天就把他送进了医院。可是刘新国看到别人都在大跃进，他却躺在医院里，心里很不是滋味，他几次瞒着护士，深更半夜跑回队去保养他驾驶的车子。
    病好以后，党支部给刘新国谈了几次话，嘱咐他要注意“巧干”。从此，刘新国的心一下子就拴在这上头了。队上有部四轮大拖车，让两位老师傅试验拖挂，结果，失败了。但这部拖车却像磁石一样吸引了刘新国。他要求党组织允许他进行试验。消息传开了，有人在背后嘀咕说：“人家老师傅都拉不成，他敢闯！把拖车整坏不算，还得把命赔上呢！”刘新国没有理会这些，挂上拖车一连四次翻过了拔海四千米的当金山。虽然跑得慢些，却能多拉一倍的货物，挂拖车是不成问题了，但怎样才能跑得快呢？他主动去找技术员和老师傅一起研究，针对拖车钢板易断的关键问题，研究改装了“副钢板”，使拖车的运行时间大大提高。别看他工作这么紧张，平时却非常注意安全和保养车辆。他懂得安全是最大的节约，车子不进修理厂就能赢得更多的时间。常常在出车回来时虽已半夜，但他一定要把车子检查好以后才去休息。多次行车的结果证明，他的这个挂着拖车的汽车并不比其他的单车跑的慢，往返锡铁山，别人三天，他也三天。从此以后，刘新国的名字就在柴达木传开了。
    1959年8月，刘新国首先创造了车吨月产一万八千吨公里的全省纪录；同年10月，他又光荣地出席了全国群英会。他永远忘不了那个多风的上午，局里全体职工敲锣打鼓欢送他，把一支红艳艳的花朵挂在他的胸前。他和柴达木交通局党委书记走在队伍的最前边。在万分激动的时刻，党委书记恳切地对他说：“时刻都要记住，咱们共产党员，越在同志们献花喝彩的时候，越要谦虚，没有党和群众，我们自己能作些什么呢？……”一直到现在，这些话还在他的脑子里念念不忘。他也无法忘记党和同志们对他的关怀和支持。出车回来，领导上亲自到伙房，关照炊事员让他吃好，深更半夜，一听到他的车子有毛病，修理工人立即从被窝里钻出来帮他修理。刘新国想：旧社会，人家管驾驶员叫“臭车夫”，谁管你跌下万丈深崖喂虎狼！而现在，党对我们工人又是怎样呵！想到这里，他就躺不下，坐不住，跑到车上车下琢磨，怎样才能拉得更多跑得更快呢？今年3月，他和技术员王文峰、柳璜等同志，共同创造了一种新设备，大大提高了汽车的牵引力。多少个寒冷的夜晚，他们躺在车底下，让夜风呛的睁不开眼，实在支持不住，就地一躺养养神又干起来，奇迹就是这样创造出来的。他和他的伙伴们还学习了外省的先进经验。在西北高原上，第一次实行了长途接力跑和列车化，一部汽车原来只能拖四、五吨，现在却拖到六十多吨，这中间怎能不费周折？困难前推后拥，像波浪一样向他们冲去！但是，在英雄面前，困难是只纸老虎。他们的车吨月产步步高升，就像攀登一座没有极顶的山峰一样，他们奋力爬着，爬着，雄伟的目标，在向他们招手！
    我乘着刘新国的汽车从敦煌到峡东，一路上听同志们夸赞着他。天将破晓，大戈壁黎明前的寒风是刺骨的，可是谈的人和听的人心里都是热呼呼的。这时，启明星在天边闪烁，列车迎着朦胧的朝霞，飞快地向前滚动。一时间，我觉得刘新国不是驾驶着他那英雄的汽车，仿佛是乘着浩荡的东风，真不知他要飞得多高多远！（附图片）
