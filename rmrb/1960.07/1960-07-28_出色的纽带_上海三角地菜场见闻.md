    What I Saw at the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market in Shanghai
    Ji Mingjiu, Ye Shitao
    Early in the morning, the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market is bustling with activity.
    Purchasers from public canteens and housewives happily buy vegetables here. It is now the season for summer vegetables to be on the market. On the slope-like shelves are displayed bright red tomatoes, emerald green cucumbers, purple eggplants... The salespeople greet them with smiling faces and cordiality, batch after batch.
    These days, people who come to Sanjiaodi to buy vegetables have this impression: the vegetable market provides convenience everywhere, and the service of the salespeople is even more attentive and enthusiastic.
    Keeping Everyone Satisfied
    Every day, more than 10,000 people come to this large vegetable market to buy vegetables; there are also hundreds of canteens linked to the vegetable market. How to satisfy both collective units and ordinary residents? This is what the salespeople are always concerned about. Not long ago, the Secretary of the Hongkou District Committee of the Communist Party of China personally came to the vegetable market to help them improve their supply work. The Party pointed out the direction: not only should the supply of vegetables be plentiful, but it should also be well distributed, and serve them in many ways according to the needs of different consumer groups.
    As a result, many projects to facilitate consumers have appeared in the vegetable market.
    Late at night, batches of fresh vegetables are transported from the suburbs to the vegetable market, and the dispatchers divide the vegetables into several portions according to the appropriate ratio and the needs of all parties, one portion for the factory supply group, one for hospitals, nurseries, and neighborhood supply stations, and another for each retail stall... Immediately, various processing machines roar into action, and before long, potatoes are peeled, onions are sliced, and scale are scraped off the hairtail... According to the menu arranged the day before with the canteen cooks, the distributors carefully allocate the dishes. At dawn, the vehicles delivering vegetables to the neighborhood canteens set off.
    In the vegetable market, almost every stall has become a "department store counter," selling both meat and vegetables in the same place, which is a new way to save consumers' shopping time. Kind-hearted salespeople saw that housewives were participating in collective production, and some people were not temporarily eating in the canteen, and had to rush to work after buying vegetables. Therefore, they put the vegetables that are usually cooked together for sale. Next to the hairtail are scallions and ginger, the beef stall has onions, and celery is sold with dried tofu... so customers don't have to run around. A family of three or four can buy a "family set meal" here, which costs five or six jiao a set, and the fresh vegetables prepared inside can be used to cook two dishes and one soup, which is both cheap and affordable.
    The popular pot vegetable stall has increased from one to three. Electric small wooden trays send pots of washed, cut, and matched vegetables to the counter, so customers can cook them as soon as they buy them back, saving more time and effort. There are more than 150 varieties of pot vegetables every day, and people from Shanghai, Ningbo, and Guangdong can buy hometown dishes that suit their tastes.
    Pregnant women and patients who are recuperating have vegetable stalls specially set up for them here, supplying some nutritious vegetables, and also avoiding congestion. Customers who believe in Islam can buy vegetables at the "halal stall." Even workers who get off work in the middle of the night can now buy fresh vegetables at the "all-night service stall."
    Be a "Consultant" for Customers
    People's lives are getting better and better, and the vegetables supplied by the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market are also increasing. However, the quantity of various vegetables on the market is always unbalanced, with less at the beginning and end of the season, and more when the concentrated season arrives. This situation is not understood by the average consumer. The salespeople of the vegetable market publicize the Party's policies and introduce production conditions at any time and place, and act as "consultants" for customers' lives.
    In the vegetable market, people can see salespeople using small microphones to introduce the ways to eat many vegetables every day, and "today's menu" is also written on several small blackboards. They design recipes according to the quantity of listed varieties, so that housewives and cooks can worry less about this. Recently, a large number of onions have been on the market. Today, the salespeople introduce fried squid with onions, tomorrow fried broad beans with onions, and the day after tomorrow fried dried tofu... A total of more than 20 kinds have been changed. Some people who are not used to eating onions also buy them back to try them after reading the menu.
    Not long ago, customers reported that there were fewer green leafy vegetables for making dumplings and wontons, but a lot of fennel was in stock. Can it be used to replace it? Old salesperson Huang Guanfu has been thinking about this question. Once, a middle-aged man bought several kilograms, and came back to buy it again the next day. This aroused Huang Guanfu's curiosity. After a conversation, he learned that he worked in a hotel, and chopped fennel to make hundred-page buns, which is a very popular dish to accompany wine. That night, he went to the hotel to "learn from experience," and then wrote the cooking method on the blackboard every day to introduce it to customers. People have one more kind of dumpling filling, and the sales of fennel have also been opened up.
    "Guests" in the Vegetable Fields
    In the green vegetable fields of several people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, recently, such people can be seen every day: they plant vegetables, harvest vegetables, weed, and water with the commune members, but they are not commune members, they are salespeople from the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market.
    Vegetable market salespeople only manage to sell vegetables, how can they run to the countryside? It turns out that during this period, in order to supply the city with more non-staple foods, the suburban people's communes planted a lot of vegetables, but it was also the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting, and the rural labor force felt insufficient. The salespeople of the vegetable market deeply understand that only when production develops can market supply be guaranteed. Seeing this situation, they took the initiative to contact some production teams of Pengpu, Jiwang, and Yanqiao communes, and after the vegetable market closed every day, they went to the countryside in turn, with more than 100 people at most. The salespeople are all vying to take supporting agriculture as their infinite glory.
    On the morning of June 16, Wang Fuzhou, secretary of the Party branch of the vegetable market, led 64 salespeople to the Xingfu Production Team of Pengpu Commune. They were here to help build melon sheds. The weather is getting hotter every day, and the cucumbers, tomatoes, and long gourds in the field are growing bigger and bigger, and they need to be trained in time to grow vigorously. As soon as this new force arrived, without resting, they squatted in the fields to insert bamboo poles, build shelves, and tie melon vines... They were busy. The production captain taught them how to do it while doing it himself. At noon, the sheds for more than five mu of cucumber fields were built, solving a problem that the commune members had been worried about for more than ten days but could not find time to do.
    However, the weather was not good, and a sudden rainstorm came in the afternoon, a burst of urgency, and it seemed that it was impossible to build the shed again. Although they did not bring rain gear, they still went to the field to help cut cabbage. The raindrops hit them directly on the face, and everyone was completely soaked from the inside out. But they didn't care, on the contrary, the more they worked, the more energetic they became. That afternoon, the salespeople and farmers cut more than 6,000 jin of cabbage together.
    The next day, the supply of Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market was not reduced due to the heavy rain.
    Connecting Production and Consumption Together
    The salespeople of the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market are most familiar with the preferences and tastes of customers, and they tell the people's commune the requirements of consumers at any time and place, so that the quantity, variety, and time of listed vegetables are more suitable for the needs of the masses. Production and consumption are invisibly twisted together through the vegetable market as a link.
    The vegetable market often invites commune members from suburban communes to come here as guests to see the business situation and listen to customer requirements. Every time they bring back valuable opinions. Once, the secretary of the Party committee and the production captain of Yanqiao Commune came to visit, and the vegetable market invited residents' representatives from five neighborhood committees nearby to hold a unique production-supply-consumption symposium. A woman from Guangdong said that she likes to eat white flower kale, and women from Ningbo and Shanghai hope to supply more soft and glutinous purple cowpeas... The commune cadres also introduced the production situation and promised to expand the production of these varieties. But they didn't have seeds. The Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market regarded the difficulties of production as its own difficulties. The salespeople looked for them everywhere, and finally found these seeds in Wujiao Commune and Xuhang Commune. Now white flower kale and purple cowpeas have been put on the market in a continuous stream.
    The vegetable market not only acts as a "matchmaker" for production and consumption, but also actively helps the commune to come up with ideas. In early June, the last batch of cabbages from the Fourth Production Team of Xingfu, Pengpu Commune was put on the market, and it was planned to plant cabbages again on the open space for supply in the autumn. Salesperson Ge Xingfu thought that consumers generally like to eat more green leafy vegetables in summer, so he suggested changing to planting amaranth and chicken feathers, and the production team agreed. These two kinds of vegetables were harvested more than 20 days after planting. Tomatoes, sword beans, and green peppers are generally on the market in June and July. However, many customers hope to eat them earlier. The Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market studied with the commune and found that the key was to raise seedlings early. To cultivate seedlings in cold weather, it is necessary to build a glass warm shed to keep out the cold. The Chenjiajiao Production Team of Jiwang Commune lacked glass, and the vegetable market took the initiative to help them buy more than a dozen boxes and built more than 20 warm sheds. This year, these summer vegetables from this production team were supplied to the market about 20 days earlier than last year.

    出色的纽带
    上海三角地菜场见闻
    吉鸣九　叶世涛
    清晨，三角地菜场里熙熙攘攘。
    公共食堂的采购员和家庭主妇，愉快地在这里买菜。现在正是夏令蔬菜上市的季节。斜坡一般的货架上，陈列着鲜红的蕃茄，翠绿的黄瓜，紫色的茄子……。营业员脸带笑容，亲切地接待着他们，一批又一批。
    这些日子，到三角地买菜的人们，都有这样一个印象：菜场处处给人方便，营业员服务也更加周到热情了。
    让大家都满意
    每天，到这个大菜场来买菜的人，总在一万以上；跟菜场挂钩的食堂，也有好几百个。怎样让集体单位和一般居民都感到满意呢？这是营业员们时刻操心的问题。不久以前，中共虹口区委书记亲自来到菜场，帮助他们改进供应工作。党指出了方向：不仅供应的菜要多，而且要分配得好，根据不同消费对象的需要，多方为他们服务。
    于是，许多便利消费者的项目在菜场里出现了。
    深夜，一批批新鲜蔬菜从郊区运到菜场，发货员按照恰当的比例和各方面的需要，把菜分成几份，一份给工厂供应组，一份发医院、托儿所、里弄供应处，另一份分到各零售摊……。顿时，各种加工机器轰隆隆地响起来，不一会，马铃薯去了皮，洋葱切成丝，带鱼刮去了鳞……，配货员根据先一天和食堂炊事员一起安排好的菜单，细致地配菜。天蒙蒙亮，给里弄食堂送菜的车子就出发了。
    菜场里，几乎每个摊头都成了“百货柜”，同一地方卖荤又卖素，这是节省消费者购买时间的新办法。好心的营业员看到家庭妇女参加了集体生产，有些人暂时没有在食堂搭伙，买完菜还得赶去上班。因此，他们把通常配烧的菜放在一起出售。带鱼旁边有葱姜，牛肉摊上有洋葱，芹菜带卖豆腐干……，顾客就用不到跑东跑西了。一家三、四口人的，在这里可以买一种“家庭和菜”，五、六角钱一套，里面配好的鲜菜可以烧出二菜一汤，既便宜又实惠。
    素来受人欢迎的盆菜摊，从一个增加到三个。电动的小木盘把一盆盆洗净、切好、配好的菜送到柜前，顾客买回去就能下锅，更加省时省力。盆菜的花色每天有一百五十多种，上海人、宁波人、广东人都可以买到适合自己口味的家乡菜。
    怀孕妇女和正在休养的病人，这里有专为他们设置的菜摊，供应一些营养丰富的菜，也避免了拥挤。信奉伊斯兰教的顾客，可以到“清真摊”买菜。就是半夜下班的工人，现在也可以在“通宵服务摊”买到新鲜蔬菜。
    当顾客的“参谋”
    人民生活越过越好，三角地菜场供应的菜也越来越多。然而，各种蔬菜上市的数量，总是不平衡的，见新和落令时候少一点，集中登场季节到货就特别多。这种情况不是一般消费者所了解的。菜场的营业员随时随地宣传党的政策，介绍生产情况，当好顾客生活上的“参谋”。
    菜场里，人们每天可以看到营业员用小话筒介绍许多菜的吃法，几块小黑板上也写着“今日菜单”。他们根据上市品种的多少，设计菜谱，让主妇和炊事员们少操这份心。最近洋葱大量上市，营业员今天介绍洋葱炒墨鱼，明天介绍洋葱炒刀豆，后天又是炒豆腐干……一共换了二十几种，有些不习惯吃洋葱的人，看了菜单，也买回去尝尝。
    不久前，顾客反映包饺子、裹馄饨的绿叶菜少了，但是，有一种茴香草到货很多。能不能用它来代替呢？老营业员黄关富一直在想这个问题。有一次，一个中年人买了好几斤，隔天又来买了。这引起黄关富的好奇，一经交谈，知道他在一家酒店工作，茴香草斩细做百页包，是一种很受欢迎的佐酒佳肴。当晚，他就到酒店“取经”，以后天天把烹调方法写在黑板上向顾客介绍。人们多了一种包饺子的菜馅，茴香草的销路也打开了。
    菜田里的“客人”
    在上海郊区好几个人民公社碧绿的菜田里，最近，每天可以看到这样一些人：他们和社员一起种菜、割菜、除草、浇水，但并不是社员，他们是三角地菜场的营业员。
    菜场营业员只管卖菜，怎么会跑到农村去呢？原来这一时期郊区人民公社为了供应城市更多的副食品，大种蔬菜，然而又正是夏收夏种的农忙季节，农村劳动力感到不足。菜场营业员深深地懂得，只有生产发展，市场供应才有保证。他们看到这个情况，主动和挂钩的彭浦、纪王、严桥等公社一些生产队联系，每天菜场落市以后，轮流下乡，多的时候有一百多人。营业员们，人人争先，把支援农业看作自己无限的光荣。
    6月16日早晨，菜场党支部书记王福洲领着六十四个营业员来到彭浦公社幸福生产队，他们是来协助搭瓜棚的。气候一天天热起来，田里的黄瓜、蕃茄、长瓜越长越大，需要及时牵藤才能茁壮地生长。这批生力军一到，顾不上休息，就蹲在田里插竹杆、搭棚架、扎瓜藤……忙个不停。生产队长在一旁边做边教，响午，五亩多黄瓜田的棚搭成了，解决了社员们十多天来挂在心头而又分不出身做的一个难题。
    可是，天不作美，下午突然来了一场暴雨，一阵急一阵，看来再搭棚是不行了。尽管他们没有带雨具，仍然下田帮助割卷心菜。雨点直往他们脸上打，每个人浑身上下，从里到外，全部湿透了。可是他们毫不在乎，相反，越干越有劲。这一下午，营业员和农民一起割了六千多斤卷心菜。
    第二天三角地菜场没有因为大雨减少了供应。
    生产消费连结一起
    三角地菜场的营业员。对顾客的爱好和口味最熟悉，他们随时随地把消费者的要求告诉人民公社，使得上市蔬菜的数量、品种和时间更加适合群众需要。生产、消费通过菜场这条纽带无形中拧在一起了。
    菜场常常邀请郊区公社的社员来这里作客，看看营业情况，听听顾客要求，每次他们都带了宝贵的意见回去。有一回严桥公社的党委书记和生产队长来参观，菜场请来附近五个里弄委员会的居民代表，开了一次别开生面的产供消座谈会。广东籍的妇女说，喜欢吃白花芥兰菜，宁波和上海籍的妇女希望多供应软而糯的紫花豇豆……。公社干部也介绍了生产情况，答应扩大生产这些品种。但是他们没有种籽。三角地菜场把生产的困难当作自己的困难一样，营业员四出觅找，终于在五角公社和徐行公社找到了这些种籽。现在白花芥兰菜和紫花豇豆都已源源上市了。
    菜场不仅当生产和消费的“媒人”，而且主动帮助公社出主意。6月初，彭浦公社幸福第四生产小队最后一批卷心菜上市了，打算在空地上再种卷心菜，秋凉时供应。营业员葛星福想到消费者夏天一般都爱多吃些绿叶菜，就建议改种米苋和鸡毛菜，生产队同意了。这两种菜下地，二十多天便收割了。蕃茄、刀豆、青椒，一般总在6、7月份上市。但是，不少顾客希望能早些吃到。三角地菜场和公社一起研究，找出关键在于提早育苗。秧苗在大冷天培育，就得搭建御寒的玻璃暖棚。纪王公社陈家角生产队缺乏玻璃，菜场主动帮助他们买到了十几箱，盖起二十多个暖棚。这个生产队今年这些夏令蔬菜比去年提前了二十来天供应市场。
