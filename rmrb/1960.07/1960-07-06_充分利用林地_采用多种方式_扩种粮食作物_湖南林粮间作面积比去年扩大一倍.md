Under the guidance of the principle of "Taking Grain as the Key Link, Overall Leap Forward," Hunan Province has vigorously promoted intercropping of forest and grain. By the end of May, the province had intercropped over 10 million mu, exceeding the annual plan and more than doubling the 4.55 million mu intercropped last year. Intercropping of forest and grain not only expanded the area and increased the yield of food crops but also promoted the overall development of forestry production. This year, the province's afforestation area has expanded by 60% compared to last year. Young forest tending has increased fourfold compared to the entire tending area last year. The survival rate of afforestation has increased from 84% last year to over 90%. The reclamation and deep plowing of tea-oil trees and tung-oil trees have also increased by multiples or dozens of times compared to last year.

Intercropping of forest and grain is a good way to increase grain production and accelerate forest productivity. It is the crystallization of labor and wisdom of the masses in mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan Province. For many years, the masses have created many effective methods for intercropping forest and grain and maintaining soil and water, such as tying up mountain slopes, closing waist gates, terracing, and opening drainage ditches, as well as "leaving a hat on the top of the mountain and leaving feet at the bottom of the mountain." Many miracles of double harvests of forest and grain have emerged. In Huitong County's forest area, which has hundreds of years of experience in intercropping forest and grain, and in Ningxiang County's hilly area, grain production has increased year after year, the survival rate of afforestation is as high as 95% or more, and trees grow rapidly. Fir forests can be cut and used in six years, and Masson pine in seven years.

As early as 1954, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China began to summarize and promote the experience of these areas, and organized cadres and the masses to visit and learn. After summarizing, promoting, summarizing and improving, and promoting again, good results have been obtained in vast areas in improving the survival rate of afforestation, promoting rapid tree growth, and increasing grain production over the past few years. Forty-nine mountainous counties in the province, which were previously short of grain, have achieved self-sufficiency or surplus in grain through intercropping of forest and grain and other reforms of the cultivation system. For example, Jianghua Yao Autonomous County was originally a grain-deficient county. After vigorously promoting intercropping of forest and grain, the miscellaneous grains harvested from intercropping forest and grain account for 80% of the county's total grain output every year, enabling the county to achieve self-sufficiency and surplus in both grain and pork. The basic solution of the grain problem has promoted the high-speed development of forestry production. Jilang Brigade of Guangping Commune in Huitong County, due to vigorously promoting intercropping of forest and grain, created "eight-year fir" with a yield of 19.1 cubic meters per mu and "six-year fir" with a yield of 16.6 cubic meters per mu. Jinlongshan in Huitong County carried out large-scale afforestation and large-scale intercropping of forest and grain. The 7,400 mu of fir forests planted in January 1958 were inspected in August last year, and the average tree height reached three or four feet, and some reached five or six feet.

With the in-depth implementation of the policy of "Taking Grain as the Key Link, Overall Leap Forward," intercropping of forest and grain has attracted more attention from leaders at all levels and the broad masses of people in the province, and the area of intercropping has gradually expanded. In 1957, the province only had 1 million mu of intercropping, which expanded to more than 4.5 million mu last year. Last winter, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China further affirmed intercropping of forest and grain as a basic system of forestry production, put it forward as an important measure to increase grain production, and issued a production plan. According to the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, party committees at all levels have included the combination of forest and grain into the production plan as an important measure to increase grain production. Fifteen mountainous counties have made resolutions on vigorously promoting the combination of forest and grain at the county party congress. Mobilize the whole party and the people of the whole province to vigorously promote intercropping of forest and grain.

Subsequently, party committees at all levels deeply mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement to vigorously promote intercropping of forest and grain. Last winter, when mobilizing the masses to formulate a plan for intercropping forest and grain, cadres and the masses were fully mobilized to discuss, and on the basis of unifying their thinking, the broad masses of cadres and the masses offered suggestions and ideas. According to the experience and opinions of the masses, the Provincial Party Committee and party committees at all levels proposed: to end intercropping of forest and grain before the transplanting of early rice, so as to change the situation in the past when intercropping of forest and grain was squeezed together with the transplanting of early rice, which affected each other. At the same time, it called on all localities to learn from the experience of Jinlongshan People's Commune in Huitong County in concentrating and connecting plots, preparing land on a large scale, and intercropping forest and grain on a large scale. Therefore, at the beginning of afforestation last winter, land preparation and afforestation were comprehensively promoted to prepare for intercropping of forest and grain. This spring, 70% of the province's afforestation was full-scale land preparation and afforestation, and more than 8.2 million mu of Jinlongshan-style terraced land afforestation were established. This has laid a good foundation for intercropping of forest and grain. At the beginning of January, as soon as afforestation in various places ended, they immediately launched a high tide of intercropping of forest and grain without stopping. At that time, 1 million people in the province went to the mountains every day. Huaihua County organized 50,000 people and 20,000 cattle to go to the mountains, and intercropped 220,000 mu in one fell swoop, with an average of one mu per person in the county. Sandu Commune in Leiyang County combined various production activities and arranged 20,000 people to go to the mountains. After seven consecutive assaults, it reclaimed 120,000 mu of forest land and intercropped 86,000 mu of forest and grain. This year, Hunan Province's intercropping of forest and grain not only started a season earlier than in previous years, and was basically completed before the transplanting of early rice; the types and methods of intercropping were also richer and more scientific than before. In the past, intercropping was limited to food crops. Now, there is not only intercropping of forest and grain, but also diversified combination of forest and agriculture such as forest and medicine (medicinal plants), forest and cash crops, forest and vegetables, and forest and green manure, according to local conditions.

Large-scale intercropping of forest and grain has also brought about a huge revolution in the cultivation techniques of intercropping of forest and grain. In order to meet the requirements of large-scale intercropping of forest and grain, Hunan Province has comprehensively promoted the experience of cattle plowing mountains created by the people of Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Cattle plowing mountains can replace manual excavation of forest land and improve the efficiency of intercropping. According to statistics from 15 counties, 30,000 cattle plowed 620,000 mu of forest land for intercropping of forest and grain, which generally increased the efficiency by more than four times compared to manual labor, saving 2 million labor days, and enabling forestry production to develop from manual tools to animal power. At present, the province is training cattle for cattle plowing mountains and operators in large quantities, and manufacturing a large number of mountain plows, preparing to promote cattle plowing mountains to tea-oil, tung-oil forest reclamation, mid-cultivation, and young forest tending.

At present, in order to ensure a double harvest of forest and grain, all parts of the province have launched a high tide of cultivation and management. All communes in Chengbu Miao Autonomous County have strengthened the management of forest land intercropped with forest and grain. The county has established 23 local fertilizer plants and 37 local pesticide plants in the mountains to prepare 330,000 jin of local fertilizer and local pesticides for the 110,000 mu of forest land intercropped with forest and grain. Sandu Commune in Leiyang County organized 98 professional teams and 996 full-time personnel to be responsible for cultivation and management. Cadres and commune members at all levels also engaged in more than 40,000 mu of demonstration mountains for high yield. (Attached picture)
   
In order to achieve a "double harvest of grain and oil," Matian Commune in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, vigorously promoted intercropping of forest and grain on 108,300 mu of tea-oil mountains. For sweet potatoes alone, the entire commune plans to intercrop 50,000 mu on tea-oil mountains. This is a picture of commune members braving the rain to rush to plant summer sweet potatoes in the tea-oil forest.

    充分利用林地　采用多种方式　扩种粮食作物
    湖南林粮间作面积比去年扩大一倍
    全省四十九个山区缺粮县，通过林粮间作和其他耕作制度的改革，现在做到粮食自给或有余。
    本报长沙5日电　湖南省在“以粮为纲，全面跃进”方针的指导下，大搞林粮间作，全省在5月底已间作了一千多万亩，超额完成了全年计划，比去年林粮间作四百五十五万亩还多一倍多。林粮间作不仅使粮食作物面积扩大，产量增加，而且推动了林业生产全面发展，全省今年造林比去年扩大了六成，幼林抚育比去年全年抚育面积增加四倍，造林成活率由去年的84％提高到90％以上，其他油茶林、油桐林垦复和深耕，都比去年成倍或数十倍地增加。
    林粮间作是增产粮食，加速林木丰产的好办法。这是湖南省山区、丘陵区群众劳动和智慧的结晶。多少年来，群众为了林粮间作，保持水土，曾创造了扎排山、封腰门、作梯土、开排水沟，以及“山顶留帽，山下留脚”等许多有效办法，也出现了许多林粮双丰收的奇迹。林粮间作有数百年经验的会同县林区，丘陵区的宁乡县，由于实行林粮间作，连年粮食增产，造林成活率高到95％以上，并且林木生长迅速，杉林六年，马尾松七年即可砍伐利用。
    早在1954年，中共湖南省委就开始总结推广这些地区的经验，组织各地干部和群众参观学习。经过总结、推广，再总结提高，再推广，几年来无论在提高造林成活率，促进林木速生和增产粮食方面，都在广大地区获得良好效果。全省有四十九个过去是缺粮的山区县，通过林粮间作和其他耕作制度的改革，现已做到粮食自给或有余。如江华瑶族自治县原来是个缺粮县，大搞林粮间作后，每年林粮间作收获的杂粮占全县粮食总产量的80％，使全县粮食和猪肉都做到了自给有余，由于粮食问题基本解决，从而促进了林业生产高速度发展。会同县广坪公社吉朗大队，由于大搞林粮间作，创造了亩产十九点一立方米的“八年杉”和亩产十六点六立方米的“六年杉”。会同县金龙山大面积造林，大面积林粮间作，1958年元月营造的七千四百亩杉树林，到去年8月检查，一般树高都达三、四尺，有的达五、六尺。
    随着“以粮为纲，全面跃进”方针的深入贯彻执行，林粮间作更加引起全省各级领导和广大群众的重视，间作的面积逐年扩大，1957年全省间作只有一百万亩，去年扩大到四百五十多万亩。去年冬天，中共湖南省委进一步把林粮间作作为林业生产的基本制度肯定下来，作为增产粮食的一个重要措施提出来，并下达了生产计划。各级党委根据中共湖南省委的指示，都把林粮结合列入生产计划，作为增产粮食的重要措施，有十五个山区县在县党代表大会上作出了大搞林粮结合的决议。动员全党和全省人民大搞林粮间作。
    接着，各级党委深入发动群众，大搞林粮间作的群众运动。去年冬季，各地在发动群众制定林粮间作计划时，就充分发动干部和群众进行讨论，在统一思想认识的基础上，广大干部和群众纷纷献计献策。省委和各级党委根据群众的经验和意见，提出：把林粮间作提早在早稻插秧前结束，改变往年林粮间作与早稻插秧挤在一起，相互影响的状况。同时号召各地学习会同县金龙山人民公社创造的集中连片、大面积整地、大面积林粮间作的经验。因此，各地在去冬造林开始时，就全面地推广整地造林，为林粮间作作准备。全省今春造林有70％是全垦整地造林，建立了金龙山式的梯土造林八百二十多万亩。这就为林粮间作打下了良好基础。元月初，各地造林刚结束，便马不停蹄、兵不解甲，造林的原班人马，掀起了林粮间作高潮。当时，全省每天有一百万人上山。怀化县组织了五万人、两万头牛上山，一举间作二十二万亩，全县每人平均有一亩。耒阳县三都公社结合各项生产，安排两万人上山，先后经过七次突击，垦复林地十二万亩，林粮间作八万六千亩。今年湖南省林粮间作不仅比往年提早了一个季节，在早稻插秧前就基本间作完毕；在间作的种类和方式上，也比以前更丰富、更科学。过去的间作只限于粮食作物，现在不仅有林粮间作，而且因地制宜地有林药（药用植物）、林与经济作物、林与蔬菜、林与绿肥等多样化的林农结合。
    大规模的林粮间作，也带来了林粮间作耕作技术的巨大革新。为了适应大面积的林粮间作的要求，湖南省全面地推广了湘西土家族苗族自治州人民创造的牛犁山的经验。牛犁山可以代替人力开挖林地，提高间作工效。据十五个县的统计，三万头耕牛为林粮间作犁整林地六十二万亩，一般比人工提高工效四倍以上，节约劳动日二百万个，使林业生产由手工工具发展到用畜力。目前，全省正在大批地训练牛犁山的耕牛和操作手，大量制造山犁，准备把牛犁山推行到油茶、油桐林垦复、中耕和幼林抚育等方面。
    目前，全省各地为了保证林粮双丰收，又掀起了培育管理高潮。城步苗族自治县各公社都加强了林粮间作的林地管理，全县在山上建立了二十三个土化肥厂、三十七个土农药场，为十一万多亩林粮间作的林地准备了三十三万斤土化肥和土农药。耒阳县三都公社组织了九十八个专业队、九百九十六个专人负责培育管理，各级干部和社员还搞了四万多亩丰产示范山。（附图片）
    为了实现“粮油双丰收”，湖南永兴县马田公社，在十万八千三百亩的油茶山上大搞林粮间作。仅红薯一项，全公社就计划在油茶山上间种五万亩。这是社员们冒雨在油茶林里抢栽夏红薯。
