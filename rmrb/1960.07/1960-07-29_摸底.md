    Understanding the Basics
    Emei
    "Sowing" is the beginning of a good harvest; "management" is the guarantee of a good harvest.

    To achieve a good harvest, a great deal of enthusiasm is needed, but this enthusiasm can only achieve the greatest effect when it is used at the "critical moment." How to use the energy in the most needed place is a great science. Taking field management as an example, whether the expected results can be achieved depends first on whether people have a correct understanding of the growth patterns of crops. If the understanding is correct and accurate, manpower and material resources can be used at the "critical moment" according to local conditions, according to the time, and according to the crops. Understanding and mastering the laws is not that mysterious. In the autumn field management of Pohu Commune in Changge County, Henan Province, a mass movement was launched in which everyone talked about experience and everyone looked for the laws of crop growth, and the laws began to be recognized. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, field management was strengthened according to the different growth patterns of various crops, and as a result, all kinds of crops in the commune flourished, and field management work was raised to a new level.

    The vast majority of farmers have accumulated some production knowledge in their production practices. What is commendable about the Pohu Commune Party Committee is that it leads the masses to summarize the unconscious, scattered, and fragmented experiences well, and after analysis, synthesis, research, and improvement, formulates scientific field management regulations. They summarized the management of the entire autumn crops into grasping five key stages (namely, ensuring full emergence, strong seedlings, vigorous stalks, spike formation, and grain filling), and when carrying out field management work, they also adopted different measures according to the characteristics of different crops and their growth patterns. Each production team went a step further and formulated more specific management measures and improved operating methods accordingly. Because they have mastered the laws of crop growth, it is easier for people to give full play to their subjective initiative and base field management work on a scientific basis, so that people's enthusiasm can be used where it is most needed.

    The Pohu Commune also put forward the four-character mantra of "early, skillful, fast, and good" in field management work, which is precisely the "true knowledge" they put forward after mastering the laws of crop growth. "Hoeing the grass one day earlier after the rain is better than applying fertilizer once," which shows the importance of grasping "early" and acting "fast" in field management. This year, in the application of human manure and urine, they have generally changed from surface fertilization to ditch fertilization, hole fertilization, and root fertilization to give full play to the fertilizer effect, which shows that the management is "skillful" and "good." It is precisely because of early and fast, skillful and good, that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Their proactive and scientifically meticulous work style is worth learning from all over the country.

    "Management" is the guarantee of a good harvest. In the "management" stage, thinning, setting seedlings, continuous loosening of soil and weeding, watering and fertilizing are necessary, and repeated struggles against various natural disasters are also required. To "manage" well, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to understand the basics of crop growth like the Pohu Commune. With an understanding of the basics, it is possible to prescribe the right medicine and tighten the field management links one after another, so as to ensure a better harvest of autumn crops.

    “种”，是丰收的开始；“管”，是丰收的保证。
    夺取丰收，需要一股很大的干劲，但是这股劲只有用到“节骨眼”上，才能收到最大的效果。怎样把劲头使在最需要的地方，这里面大有学问。以田间管理来说，能不能收到预期的效果，首先取决于人们对农作物的生长规律有没有正确的认识。认识正确了，掌握准了，就可以因地制宜、因时制宜、因作物制宜地把人力物力用在“节骨眼”上。认识规律和掌握规律并不那么神秘，河南长葛县坡胡公社在秋田管理中，开展了一个人人谈经验、个个找作物生长规律的群众运动，规律就开始被认识了。在公社党委的领导下，根据各种作物不同的生长规律，加强了田间管理，结果全社各种作物欣欣向荣，田间管理工作提高到了一个新的水平。
    广大农民在生产实践中，都或多或少地积累了一些生产知识。坡胡公社党委难能可贵的是，领导群众把不自觉的分散的点点滴滴的经验很好地总结起来，经过分析、综合、研究、提高，制订出科学的田间管理规程。他们把整个秋田作物的管理总结为抓五关（即全苗、壮苗、轰秆、攻穗、攻粒），而且在进行田间管理工作的时候，还根据不同作物的特性和它的生长规律，采取不同的措施。各个生产队则更进一步，又各自订出了更具体的管理措施，并且相应地改进操作方法。由于掌握了作物生长规律，就便于人们充分地发挥主观能动作用，使田间管理工作建立在科学的基础上，而人们的干劲也就能用到最需要的地方。
    坡胡公社在田间管理工作上，还提出了“早、巧、快、好”的四字诀，这也正是他们掌握了作物生长规律以后，提出来的“真经”。雨后“早锄一天草、赛追一次肥”，这说明田间管理抓得“早”，行动“快”的重要性。今年，他们在施人粪尿上，普遍改表面施肥为开沟施肥、挖穴施肥和围根施肥，以充分发挥肥效，这说明了管得“巧”、管得“好”。正是早和快、巧和好，才能事半功倍。他们的这种工作上争取主动和科学细致的作风，值得各地学习。
    “管”是丰收的保证。在“管”的阶段里，要间苗、定苗，不断地松土锄草，浇水追肥，还要和各种自然灾害作反复的斗争。要“管”得好，就需要像坡胡公社那样，发动群众去摸作物生长的底。有了底，才能对症下药，使田间管理环环扣紧，一环不松，从而保证秋季作物获得更好的收成。
