Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" held a meeting of its executive committee in Tokyo today to discuss strengthening the organization of the movement against the new "Security Treaty." At the meeting, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Council for the Defense of Peace and Democracy all suggested strengthening the existing anti-"Security Treaty" councils at the central and local levels, and developing them into permanent organizations to fight for the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Representatives from the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, and the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases in Japan supported this suggestion.
　　
The executive committee will continue to discuss this issue. At the same time, according to an announcement by the secretariat of the National Council, the National Councils to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" in twenty-one prefectures have already developed into permanent organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Teachers' Union, with 600,000 members, convened a three-day central committee meeting today to discuss strengthening the struggle to demand the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and oppose the fascist "Performance Rating" system.

The union's chairman, Takeshi Kobayashi, stated in his address that the "Performance Rating" system, which restricts the political and ideological freedom of teachers, is part of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system. He called on teachers to actively launch struggles in various forms such as workplace rallies to oppose this reactionary system.

The union's executive department submitted a draft of the current struggle policy to the meeting. This draft stipulates that the union will resolutely struggle to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and oppose the government's suppression of participants in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: Approximately five hundred artists held a rally for democracy and against the new "Security Treaty" last night.

The well-known Japanese critic, Yoko Matsuoka, emphasized in her speech that only when Japan forces the United States to withdraw its bases in Japan and becomes a truly independent country can Japan coexist peacefully with China and the United States based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Liang Mae-ri, an expert on international issues, emphasized in his speech that it is necessary for the Japanese people to further develop the united strength in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and resolutely strive for independence and democracy.

The new organization established by Japanese artists that initiated this rally includes well-known figures in society such as Inosuke Ishitani, Toyoshiro Fukuda, Tokusaburo Masamune, and Arata Hongo.

    决心加强反对日美条约的斗争
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议今天在东京举行干事会会议，讨论加强反对新“安全条约”运动的组织。在会议上，社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会和东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议都建议加强中央和地方现有的反对“安全条约”会议，把它们发展成为为废除新日美“安全条约”而斗争的永久性的组织。日中友好协会、日本和平委员会和日本反对军事基地全国联络会议的代表支持这个建议。
    干事会将就这个问题继续进行讨论。与此同时，据国民会议事务局宣布，二十一个县的阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议已经发展成永久性组织。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：拥有六十万会员的日本教职员工会今天召开为期三天的中央委员会会议，讨论加强要求废除新日美“安全条约”和反对法西斯“勤务评定”制度的斗争。
    这个工会的委员长小林武在会上致词时指出：限制教职员政治思想自由的“勤务评定”制度是新日美“安全条约”体系的一部分。他号召教职员们积极展开工作场所大会等各种形式的斗争，反对这种反动制度。
    工会的执行部向会议提出了当前斗争方针草案。这个草案规定，工会将坚决进行斗争，争取废除新日美“安全条约”，并且反对政府镇压反对“安全条约”运动的参加者。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：大约五百名艺术家昨天晚上举行争取民主和反对新“安全条约”大会。
    日本著名评论家松冈洋子在会上讲话时强调说，只有在迫使美国撤出在日本的基地而使日本成为真正独立的国家的时候，日本才能够根据和平共处五项原则，同中国和美国和平共处。
    国际问题专家前里良在会上讲话时强调说，日本人民有必要进一步发展在反对“安全条约”的斗争中团结起来的力量，坚决争取独立与民主。
    发起这次大会的日本全国艺术家成立的新组织，其中包括石谷伊之助、福田丰四郎、正宗得三郎和本乡新等社会知名人士。
