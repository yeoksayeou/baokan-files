Leaders Go Deep into the Front Lines: Work and Study Yield Double Success
Zhangping County Experience Proves the “Two-Five System” Leadership Method is Good

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Fujian Daily, leaders at the county, commune, and team levels in Zhangping County have conscientiously implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, successfully solving the problem of cadres participating in production and leading production, vigorously promoting various tasks throughout the county, and achieving preliminary experience in promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method.

After Zhangping implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, cadres at all levels throughout the county had unified arrangements for meetings, study, and in-depth work time, work was planned, and meetings were prepared. Meetings in many departments throughout the county were reduced by half, cadres at all levels spent less time in offices and more time at the grassroots level. Agriculture secretaries went deep into the fields, industry secretaries went deep into the mines and in front of furnaces, finance and trade secretaries went deep into the canteens, and leading cadres from all fronts went deep into the front lines of production. Of the twenty-four county committee members, twenty-one went deep into the grassroots level, an increase of ten over the past. More than 6,000 cadres at the three levels throughout the county went deep into the grassroots level, and 99% of the cadres at the commune and brigade levels went deep to lead production. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, cadres at all levels also had ample time to study the Party's policies and theories, and many people improved their ideological level, achieving double success in work and study. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, various departments, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, implemented division of labor by line, contracted responsibilities, served the center, and vigorously carried out business work around the central work, achieving comprehensive leaps in both central work and departmental business work.

The great success achieved by Zhangping in promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method is the result of vigorous ideological mobilization by leaders at all levels. When they began to promote the "Two-Five System" leadership method, most cadres were able to recognize the importance of implementing this leadership method and consciously took action; however, a small number of cadres did not sufficiently recognize the importance of promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method, and their implementation was not vigorous enough. In response to this situation, the Zhangping County Committee of the Communist Party of China first conducted publicity and education on the "Two-Five System" leadership method for cadres at all levels, enabling the vast number of cadres to fully understand the specific content and benefits of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, so that they could consciously implement this leadership method. While vigorously engaging in ideological mobilization, the county committee also made specific arrangements for promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method based on the different situations of each commune, team, and department. In the county's implementation of the "Two-Five System," three forms were generally adopted: First, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, various departments divided labor by line, contracted responsibilities, grasped key points to lead the overall situation, held regular meetings, exchanged information, summarized experience, and organized promotion; second, commanders at all levels were linked together, and combatants established key teams, focusing on one point to gain experience and guide the overall situation; third, the two groups of cadres who went deep into the grassroots level and remained in the offices unified their thinking, unified their actions, closely cooperated between the front and the rear, and rotated training, so that every cadre could have the opportunity to go deep into the grassroots level to become familiar with the situation and constantly improve their practical work ability.

In the county's implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, Party committees at all levels also included the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method in their daily agenda, and while checking and arranging central work, they also deployed and checked the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method. This frequent inspection and summary enabled the "Two-Five System" leadership method to be fully promoted and continuously developed throughout the county. The commercial department's implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method was not good at the beginning, but measures were immediately taken to improve it after inspection. After frequent inspections and summaries, the finance, taxation and other departments delegated cadres, contracted responsibilities by region, and twisted business work and central work into one rope, so that they could both serve the center and promote departmental work.

In the process of implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method, Party committees at all levels in Zhangping County also paid attention to careful arrangement of work, greatly reduced meetings, and improved the quality of meetings.

    领导深入第一线　工作学习双丰收
    漳平县经验证明“二五制”领导方法好
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：漳平县县、社、队各级领导认真贯彻
  “二五制”的领导方法，出色地解决了干部参加生产领导生产的问题，有力推动了全县各项工作，并且取得了推行“二五制”领导方法的初步经验。
    漳平推行“二五制”领导方法后，全县各级干部由于开会、学习、深入工作的时间有了统一安排，工作有计划，开会有准备，全县许多部门会议减少一半，各级干部蹲机关少了，深入基层多了，农业书记深入田间，工业书记深入矿山炉前，财贸书记深入食堂，条条战线的领导干部都深入生产第一线，全县县委委员二十四人，深入基层的有二十一人，比过去增加了十人。全县三级干部深入基层的达六千多人，公社、大队两级干部深入下去领导生产的占99％。实行“二五制”领导方法后，各级干部还有了充分的时间学习党的政策和理论，许多人提高了思想水平，做到了工作学习双丰收。各部门在推行“二五制”领导方法后，在党委统一领导下，实行分线作战，包干负责，服务中心，并且围绕中心工作，大力开展业务工作，做到以业务服务中心，以中心带动业务，实现了中心工作和部门业务工作全面跃进。
    漳平推行“二五制”领导方法取得很大成绩，是各级领导大搞思想发动的结果。他们在开始推行“二五制”领导方法时，绝大部分干部都能认识实行这个领导方法的重要意义，自觉地行动起来；但也有小部分干部对推行“二五制”领导方法的重要意义认识不足，贯彻不够有力，针对这一情况，中共漳平县委首先对各级干部进行了推行“二五制”领导方法的宣传教育，使广大干部充分认识“二五制”的具体内容和好处，使他们能自觉地执行这种领导方法。在大搞思想发动的同时，县委还根据各社、队和部门的不同情况，对推行“二五制”领导方法作了具体安排。全县在贯彻
  “二五制”领导中，一般是采取三种形式：一是各部门在党委统一领导下，分线作战，分工包干，抓点带面，定期碰头，交流情况，总结经验，组织推广；二是指挥员层层挂钩，战斗员建立重点队，突击一点，搞出经验，指导全面；三是深入基层和留机关的两套干部统一思想，统一行动，前方后方密切配合，相互交换，轮流锻炼，使每个干部都能够有机会深入基层熟悉情况，不断提高实际工作能力。
    这个县在贯彻“二五制”领导方法中，各级党委都把贯彻执行“二五制”领导方法列入日常议程，检查布置中心工作时，同时部署和检查“二五制”领导方法执行情况。这样经常的检查和总结，使“二五制”领导方法在全县得到了全面的推行和不断的发展。商业部门开头贯彻“二五制”领导方法不够好，通过检查立即采取了措施，加以改进。财政、税务等部门，通过经常检查和总结后，下放干部，分片包干，把业务工作和中心工作扭成一股绳，做到既服务中心，又推动部门工作。
    漳平县各级党委在贯彻执行“二五制”领导方法中，还注意了周密安排工作，大大减少会议，并提高了会议质量。
