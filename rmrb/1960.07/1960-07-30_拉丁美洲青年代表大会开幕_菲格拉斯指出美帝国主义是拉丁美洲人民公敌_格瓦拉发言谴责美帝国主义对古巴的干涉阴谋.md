Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th — The First Latin American Youth Congress solemnly opened tonight at the Blanquita Theatre in the Cuban capital.

More than five thousand youth representatives and invited guests from all walks of life attended the congress, including more than eight hundred from various Latin American countries.

Youth representatives from the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iraq, Sweden and other countries attended the congress.

Also participating in the congress were prominent figures from various countries around the world, including former Guatemalan President Arbenz, Latin American Labor Federation President Toledano, Chilean Workers' United Trade Union President Blaistein, World Peace Council representative Four Mata, and World Federation of Democratic Youth representatives.

The agenda of the congress includes: the current political, economic, and social situation in Latin America, national sovereignty, the right to self-determination of the people, colonialism, military budgets and militarization, land reform and industrialization, living and working conditions, illiteracy, youth and Latin American solidarity, and other issues.

Gerardo Figueras, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Congress, pointed out in his opening speech: Representatives from many Latin American countries finally overcame the numerous obstacles set by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and participated in this congress. He said that representatives from Argentina were arrested, and representatives from Ecuador walked all the way to Caracas in order to participate in the congress, and some representatives were obstructed by American airlines on the way.

Figueras reviewed the history of imperialist aggression in Latin America, saying that the youth of Latin America know that imperialism is the enemy of Latin American liberation and that the common enemy of the people of all Latin American countries—U.S. imperialism—should be defeated. Figueras emphasized that only through struggle and sacrifice can the complete liberation of Latin America be achieved. Figueras condemned the U.S. aggression against Cuba and called on the people of all Latin American countries to unite and support the Cuban revolution.

Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, said at the congress that the imperialists have not given up their aggression against Cuba, and their tools are the Organization of American States, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Guevara condemned the U.S. schemes of interference in Cuba and called on the people of all Latin American countries to unite in struggle. Guevara said: We need all kinds of strength, we need the strength of the people of all Latin American countries.

Guevara pointed out that the Soviet Union, People's China, and the socialist countries are friends of the Cuban people. He said, "Some authorities advise us not to pay attention to those who help us, but to lick the hands of those who exploit us," but, "we must treat friends as friends and enemies as enemies."

Chilean Workers' United Trade Union President Blaistein delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress.

    参加这次大会的有五千多位青年代表和应邀参加会议的各界人士，其中有八百多人来自拉丁美洲各国。
    苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、伊拉克、瑞典等国的青年代表出席了大会。
    参加大会的还有世界各国的著名人士，其中有危地马拉前总统阿本斯、拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺、智利工人统一工会主席布莱斯特、世界和平理事会代表富尔·玛塔以及世界民主青年联盟代表。
    代表大会的议程有：拉丁美洲政治、经济和社会现况，国家主权，人民自决权，殖民主义，军事预算和军国主义化，土地改革和工业化，生活和劳动条件，文盲，青年和拉丁美洲团结等问题。
    代表大会筹备委员会主席赫拉尔多·菲格拉斯在开幕词中指出：许多拉丁美洲国家的代表终于克服了美帝国主义及其走狗所设置的重重障碍，参加了这次代表大会。他说，阿根廷的代表遭到逮捕，厄瓜多尔的代表为了参加代表大会一直步行到加拉加斯，有些代表在途中受到美国航空公司的阻挠。
    菲格拉斯回顾了帝国主义侵略拉丁美洲的历史，他说，拉丁美洲的青年知道，帝国主义是拉丁美洲解放的敌人，应该击溃拉丁美洲各国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义。菲格拉斯强调指出，只有进行斗争和作出牺牲才能获得拉丁美洲的彻底解放。菲格拉斯谴责美国对古巴的侵略，并且号召拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来和支援古巴革命。
    古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉在代表大会上讲话说，帝国主义者并没有放弃对古巴的侵略，他们的工具是美洲国家组织、尼加拉瓜和危地马拉。格瓦拉谴责美国对古巴的干涉阴谋，并号召拉丁美洲各国人民在斗争中团结起来。格瓦拉说：我们需要各种力量，需要拉丁美洲各国人民的力量。
    格瓦拉指出，苏联、人民中国和社会主义国家是古巴人民的朋友。他说，“有些当权者劝我们不要理会那些援助我们的人，而去舐那些剥削我们的人的手”，但是，“我们要把朋友当作朋友，把敌人当作敌人”。
    智利工人统一工会主席布莱斯特向大会致了祝辞。
