Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 19th: Panmunjom News: At the 122nd meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held today, Zhu Changjun, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding the provocative actions of the US in recently increasing US military forces in South Korea on a large scale and plotting a new war, and strongly demanded that the US immediately withdraw US troops and illegally introduced atomic weapons and missiles from South Korea.

	At the meeting, Zhu Changjun pointed out that the July 12th issue of the American "Newsweek" revealed that the US side is transporting eight thousand American soldiers to South Korea in order to step up war preparations in South Korea. The "United Nations Command" spokesman publicly acknowledged this fact on the same day.

	Zhu Changjun said that the Armistice Agreement stipulates that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea and the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully. Today, when the Chinese People's Volunteers have already taken the initiative to completely withdraw from Korea, the Korean People's Army has reduced its troop strength by 80,000, and the entire Korean people strongly demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, the US military not only refuses to leave South Korea, but also openly increases US military forces on a large scale, launches atomic weapons and missiles one after another, conducts provocative military activities, and intensifies the tense situation in Korea. This action by the US is a blatant violation of the Armistice Agreement and a vicious provocation against the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world.

	Zhu Changjun pointed out that the reason why the US is increasing troops on a large scale today is also to fill South Korea with aggressive troops, so as to threaten the South Korean people who are rising up to fight, and continue to maintain the United States' tottering colonial rule in South Korea.

	Zhu Changjun strongly condemned and protested against this heinous act by the US, demanding that the US immediately withdraw the US troops that are heading to South Korea back to the United States, and withdraw the US troops occupying South Korea and its illegally transported atomic weapons and missiles from South Korea. Facing the solemn condemnation from the Korean-Chinese side, US Chief Commissioner Delson tried hard to appear calm, but could not hide his embarrassed expression. In order to get out of the predicament and reject the legitimate demands of the Korean-Chinese side, he even nonsensically said that the issue of troop withdrawal "should not be discussed at the Military Armistice Commission meeting."

	Zhu Changjun sternly refuted the US's fallacy and pointed out: The US's attitude at today's meeting clearly shows that the US has no sincerity in fulfilling the Armistice Agreement, and attempts to permanently occupy South Korea and turn South Korea into an outpost base for the US to invade the Far East and launch another war of aggression.

	Zhu Changjun warned the US that in order to lead the armistice to a consolidated peace, the Korean-Chinese side will never tolerate such reckless actions by the US, and it is absolutely impossible for the US to stay in South Korea. If the US insists on its position of aggression and war, it will only plunge American imperialism itself into an abyss from which it cannot extricate itself.

    朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在军事停战委员会会议上
    严正抗议美国增兵策划新战争
    并强硬要求美方立即把美军和原子武器撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤19日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在今天举行的军事停战委员会第一百二十二次会议上，就美方最近在南朝鲜大量增加美军兵力、策划新战争的挑衅行动，向美方提出了严重抗议，并且强硬要求美方立即把美军和非法运入的原子武器和导弹撤出南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，7月12日的美国“新闻周刊”透露，美方为了在南朝鲜加紧进行备战活动，正在把八千名美国士兵运往南朝鲜。同一天“联合国军”发言人公开承认了这一事实。
    朱昌骏少将说，停战协定规定应从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，和平解决朝鲜问题。今天，当中国人民志愿军早已主动全部撤离朝鲜，朝鲜人民军已经裁减了八万人，全体朝鲜人民强烈要求美军撤出南朝鲜的时候，美军却不仅赖在南朝鲜不走，而且还公然大量增加美军兵力，接二连三地发射原子武器和导弹，进行挑衅性军事活动，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。美方的这种行动是悍然违反停战协定的行为，是对朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的恶毒挑衅。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方之所以在今天大量增兵，也是为了在南朝鲜各地布满侵略军队，以此来威胁奋起进行斗争的南朝鲜人民，继续维持美国在南朝鲜摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。
    朱昌骏少将强烈谴责和抗议美方的这种罪恶行为，要求美方立即把正在开往南朝鲜的美军撤回美国，把强占着南朝鲜的美军及其非法运入的原子武器和导弹撤出南朝鲜。面对着朝中方面的严正谴责，美方首席委员德森虽然强作镇静，但始终无法掩饰其狼狈不堪的神情。为了摆脱窘境和拒绝朝中方面的正当要求，他竟胡说什么撤军问题“不应在军事停战委员会会议上讨论”。
    朱昌骏少将严厉驳斥了美方的谬论，并指出：美方今天在会上的态度清楚地表明美方对履行停战协定毫无诚意，企图永远强占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成美国侵略远东的前哨基地，再次发动侵略战争。
    朱昌骏少将警告美方，为了把停战导向巩固的和平，朝中方面决不能容忍美方的这种轻率的行动，美方赖在南朝鲜不走是绝对不行的。如果美方坚持其侵略和战争立场，那只能使美帝国主义自己陷于不能自拔的深渊。
