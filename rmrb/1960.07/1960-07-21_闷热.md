    Sultry

    The sensation of heat can be divided into two types: dry heat (or scorching heat) and humid heat (or sultry heat), which is due to the different amounts of water vapor in the air.

    Due to metabolism, even when sitting still, the human body dissipates a large calorie of heat per minute (which can reach more than eight large calories during intense labor). This heat is dissipated through blood circulation and the contact of the skin with the air. When the air temperature is higher than 33 degrees Celsius, metabolic heat is not easily dissipated, so one feels hot. The sensation of heat stimulates the brain through reflexes of nerve endings, causing sweat glands throughout the body to perspire. The evaporation of sweat requires the absorption of a large amount of heat, which immediately lowers the human body temperature and maintains normalcy.

    When the air humidity increases, the water vapor content also increases, the heat capacity of the humid air increases, and the thermal conductivity is slightly reduced. Therefore, when the human body is in humid air, it is more difficult to dissipate heat than in dry air. The specific heat and thermal conductivity of water are much greater than those of air, so in hot water that is higher than body temperature, more heat is transferred to the human body faster than in humid air of the same temperature, and we feel hotter (but in water lower than body temperature, because heat dissipation is faster, we feel cooler).

    When the humidity is high and the wind is weak, the sweat on the skin is not easily evaporated, and heat dissipation is difficult, so the uncomfortable feeling of sultriness is produced.

    The critical temperature and humidity that produce a sultry feeling vary from person to person. According to experiments, a hot feeling generally occurs when the air temperature is higher than 33 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity (the ratio of the actual water vapor content in the air to the maximum possible water vapor content) is between 60% and 70%. However, when the relative humidity is lower than 60%, a hot feeling occurs only when the air temperature reaches 35 degrees Celsius. When the relative humidity is greater than 80%, a sultry feeling begins to occur from 29 degrees Celsius.

    闷热
    热的感觉可分为二种：干热（或称焦热）和湿热（或称闷热），这是因为空气中含水汽量不同的缘故。
    由于新陈代谢的作用，即使在静坐时，人体每分钟也要发散一大卡的热量（在劳动强度很大时可以达到八大卡以上）。这些热量通过血液循环和皮肤与空气的接触而发散。当气温高于摄氏三十三度时，代谢热量不易发散，因此就感到热。热的感觉通过神经末稍的反射刺激大脑，使全身汗腺流汗。汗蒸发时需要吸收大量的热，使人体体温马上降低，维持正常。
    当空气湿度增高时，水汽含量也增加，湿空气的热容量增大，而导热性能却反略为降低，所以人体处于湿空气中时，比干空气中更难散失热量。水的比热和导热系数都比空气大得多，所以在比体温高的热水中比同温的湿空气中，由于水传给人体的热量更多更快，我们更觉得热（但在比体温低的水中因为传导散热快，反有凉快的感觉）。
    湿度高而风小时，皮肤上的汗就不易蒸发，散热困难，所以就产生了闷热的不舒服感觉。
    产生闷热感觉的临界温度和湿度是因人而异的，据试验，一般在气温高于摄氏三十三度相对湿度（空气中实际含水汽量与最大可能含水汽量之比）在百分之六十至百分之七十时就有热的感觉。但当相对湿度低于百分之六十时，气温达到摄氏三十五度才有热的感觉。相对湿度大于百分之八十时，从摄氏二十九度开始就已经有闷热的感觉了。
