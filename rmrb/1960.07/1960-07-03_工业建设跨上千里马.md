Industrial construction in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's Yellow River Plain has leaped onto a thousand-li horse, rapidly galloping towards the goal of establishing an industrial base for the autonomous region. A preliminary foundation for industries such as metallurgy, coal, electricity, machinery, chemicals, petroleum, ceramics, and leather processing has now been established on this plain, with approximately 280 industrial enterprises. Many new products have been added, including pig iron, silicon iron, steel, machine tools, electric motors, cement, sulfuric acid, machine-made paper, and sugar.

The Ningxia Yellow River Plain has broad prospects for industrial development. It is located east of the Yellow River and west of the Helan Mountains, with abundant underground mineral resources, convenient transportation, rich hydropower resources, and relatively developed agriculture and animal husbandry. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, especially after the opening of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and the establishment of the autonomous region, under the warm care of the central government and the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, Hui and Han workers have resolutely implemented the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policy. Starting from "small-scale indigenous groups," they have begun comprehensive industrial construction on the plain. After only two years, not only has the situation of "not having an inch of iron" ended, but the metallurgical industry has also leaped from a stage dominated by "small-scale indigenous groups" to a new stage dominated by "small-scale modern groups," and four iron smelting base points have been initially built and are under construction. The autonomous region's coal industry base is also taking shape. The power industry added 10,000 kilowatts of capacity last year alone. In addition to continuing the construction of the Shizuishan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, Shizuishan Coal Mine, Yellow River Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project, Yinchuan Sugar Factory, Cotton Textile Factory, Qingtongxia Paper Mill, Chemical Factory, etc., preparations are also actively underway to build larger factories such as the Ningxia Mining General Equipment Manufacturing Factory, Ningxia Internal Combustion Engine Repair Factory, and Ningxia Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory.

    工业建设跨上千里马
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区黄河平原上，工业建设跨上了千里马，迅速向自治区工业基地的目标飞奔。现在，在这个平原上已经建立起冶金、煤炭、电力、机械、化工、石油、陶瓷、皮毛加工等工业的初步基础，约二百八十多个工业企业，增加了生铁、釸铁、钢材、机床、电动机、水泥、硫酸、机制纸、食糖等许多新产品。
    宁夏黄河平原在发展工业上有着广阔的前途，这里东靠黄河，西傍贺兰山，地下矿藏很多，交通便利，水力资源丰富，农牧业又比较发达。从1958年大跃进以来，特别是包兰铁路通车和自治区成立以后，在中央的亲切关怀和全国人民的热情支援下，回、汉族职工坚决贯彻执行了党的一整套两条腿走路的方针，从“小土群”起步，在平地上开始了全面的工业建设。只经过两年多时间，不但结束了“手无寸铁”的局面，而且冶金工业已经从以“小土群”为主的阶段跃入以“小洋群”为主的新阶段，初步建成和正在兴建四个炼铁基点。自治区煤炭工业基地也初具规模。电力工业仅去年新增加能力就有一万瓩。目前除正在继续建设石咀山钢铁联合企业、石咀山煤矿、黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程、银川糖厂、棉纺厂、青铜峡造纸厂、化工厂等外，还在积极筹备兴建宁夏矿山通用设备制造厂、宁夏内燃机修造厂、宁夏农牧机械厂等规模较大的工厂。
