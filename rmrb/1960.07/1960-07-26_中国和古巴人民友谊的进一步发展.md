    Further Development of the Friendship Between the Chinese and Cuban People
    By Renmin Ribao Commentator

    The Chinese and Cuban governments have signed three agreements in Havana concerning trade, scientific and technological cooperation, and cultural cooperation. This is a great joy for the people of both China and Cuba, marking a further development of the economic and cultural ties between the two peoples. Our people warmly welcome the signing of these agreements and sincerely congratulate the increasing friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples.

    The Chinese and Cuban people have a deep friendship. The Chinese people regard the Cuban people's revolutionary victory as their own victory and resolutely support the Cuban people's just struggle to defend the revolution and oppose American intervention. U.S. imperialism, out of hostility towards the Chinese people and in an attempt to isolate Cuba, has tried to prevent the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Cuban peoples, but has not succeeded. The Chinese and Cuban peoples have increasingly strengthened their friendship and unity in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. Their friendly exchanges have become more and more frequent, and the two countries have established economic ties, signing trade contracts twice. Now the governments of the two countries have formally concluded three important economic, scientific, technological, and cultural agreements. This fully demonstrates that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples cannot be destroyed by any force.

    Although China and Cuba have different social systems, we have the same tasks: to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, to safeguard our independence, and to develop our national economies. Therefore, we not only need but can also support and help each other. The three five-year agreements concluded between China and Cuba are an important milestone in the development of economic, technological, scientific, and cultural cooperation between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. According to the trade payment agreement, China will purchase 500,000 tons of sugar and other commodities from Cuba each year, and will provide Cuba with the industrial equipment it needs in the form of long-term loans. When U.S. imperialism is currently trying its best to trap the Cuban people by reducing Cuba's sugar import quota and other economic threats, China's trade with Cuba undoubtedly has special significance. It will help the Cuban people develop their national economy and defeat the interventionist conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, Cuba's exports of minerals, raw materials, and other products to China will certainly help our country's economic construction. The provisions in the agreement that both parties will grant each other most-favored-nation treatment in terms of payment methods, tariff collection, and customs procedures embody the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries. This stands in stark contrast to the trade relations of harming others to benefit oneself established by U.S. imperialism and other countries. The scientific and technological cooperation agreement and the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Cuba stipulate that both parties shall take measures to promote the development of science and technology and cooperate in education, scientific and cultural activities, and publicity. This cooperation will not only promote the development of the two countries' economic, cultural, and scientific undertakings, but also enhance the mutual understanding between the two peoples. In the future, cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Cuban peoples will surely develop more vigorously.

    The Cuban people are facing a serious threat of U.S. imperialist aggression. The U.S. ruling clique has exhausted all kinds of despicable and vicious interventionist means in an attempt to strangle the Cuban revolution, and has recently intensified its conspiracy to isolate and harass Cuba in order to prepare for further open armed intervention. The U.S. ruling clique thinks that they can overwhelm the Cuban people, that they can force them to yield, by stopping economic "aid" to Cuba, stopping the supply of oil to Cuba, and stopping the import of Cuban sugar. These insidious imperialists are completely miscalculating. As Prime Minister Castro said, "The world is vast," and the Cuban people have friends all over the world. Not only do the people of Latin American countries resolutely stand by the Cuban people, but also the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving people around the world resolutely stand by the Cuban people. With the support of the people of the world, the Cuban people will surely overcome all the difficulties created by U.S. imperialism, and will surely defeat any act of aggression by U.S. imperialism.

    中国和古巴人民友谊的进一步发展
    本报评论员
    中国和古巴政府在哈瓦那签订了有关贸易、科学和技术合作以及文化合作的三项协定。这对于中国和古巴人民来说，都是一件大喜事，它标志着两国人民经济和文化联系的进一步发展。我国人民热烈欢迎这些协定的签订，并衷心祝贺中古两国人民友谊日益增进。
    中国人民和古巴人民有着深厚的友谊。中国人民把古巴人民的革命胜利看成是自己的胜利，并且坚决支持古巴人民保卫革命和反对美国干涉的正义斗争。美帝国主义由于敌视中国人民，同时也是为了孤立古巴，力图阻挠中古两国人民发展友好关系，但是却没有能够达到目的。中国和古巴人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中日益加强了友谊和团结，相互间的友好往来越来越频繁，两国并且建立了经济联系，先后两次签订了贸易合同。现在两国政府又正式缔结了三项重要的经济、科学技术和文化协定。这充分表明中国和古巴人民的友谊是任何力量所破坏不了的。
    中国和古巴尽管社会制度不同，但是我们都有着相同的任务：反对美帝国主义侵略，维护自己的独立，发展自己的民族经济；因此我们彼此之间不但需要而且可以互相支援，互相帮助。中古两国缔结的三项为期五年的协定就是两国在平等互利的基础上发展经济、科学技术和文化合作的一个重要的里程碑。根据贸易支付协定，我国每年向古巴购买五十万吨食糖和其他商品，并将以长期贷款方式为古巴提供所需要的工业装备。当美帝国主义目前正在竭力想用削减古巴食糖进口定额和其他经济威胁手段来困住古巴人民的时候，中国同古巴的贸易无疑有着特别重要的意义，它将有助于古巴人民发展自己的民族经济和击败美帝国主义的干涉阴谋。同时古巴将向中国出口的矿石、原料和其他产品，对于我国的经济建设，也肯定有所帮助。双方在协定中规定支付的方式以及在征收关税和海关手续方面互相给予最惠国待遇，都体现了两国互助合作的精神。这同美帝国主义和其他国家所建立的损人利己的贸易关系，成为最鲜明的对照。中古两国的科学和技术合作协定和文化合作协定，分别规定双方采取措施促进科学和技术发展，在教育、科学和文化活动以及宣传等方面进行合作，这种合作不仅将会促进两国的经济、文化和科学事业的发展，而且还会增进两国人民的相互了解。今后中国和古巴人民的文化交流必将更蓬勃地发展。
    古巴人民正面对着美帝国主义侵略的严重威胁。美国统治集团用尽了各种卑鄙和凶恶的干涉手段，企图扼杀古巴的革命，近来特别加紧策划孤立和困扰古巴的阴谋，以便为它进一步进行公开武装干涉作准备。美国统治集团以为他们停止对古巴的经济“援助”，停止对古巴的石油供应，停止进口古巴的食糖，就能够把古巴人民难倒，就能够迫使他们屈膝，这些阴谋毒辣的帝国主义者是完全打错算盘了。正如卡斯特罗总理所说的，“世界是广阔的”，古巴人民的朋友遍天下。不但拉丁美洲各国人民坚决站在古巴人民一边，社会主义各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民也坚决站在古巴人民一边。古巴人民在全世界人民的支援下，一定能够克服美帝国主义给他们所制造的一切困难，一定能够击败美帝国主义的任何侵略行动。
