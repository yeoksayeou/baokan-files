Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The Belgian government arrogantly declared in a note to the Congolese government yesterday that Belgium would not withdraw its invading troops from the Congo.

　　This note was issued after the Belgian cabinet held an all-night meeting to discuss the UN Security Council resolution on the Congo and the Congolese government's announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Belgium. In this note, the Belgian government stated that the Belgian invading forces would continue to carry out "their current mission" until the UN forces could guarantee the so-called "security and public order" of the Congo.

　　This arrogant attitude of the Belgian government is consistent with the openly adopted policy of the United States. When the UN Security Council discussed the Congo issue on the 13th, the US representative to the UN, Lodge, insisted that Belgium had not committed any aggression against the Congo, and he openly expressed "doubt" as to "whether it was wise" to demand that Belgium withdraw its invading troops from the Congo in the resolution. Lodge said that the United States voted in favor of this resolution because it "believed" that the withdrawal of Belgian troops would depend on "whether the United Nations can successfully carry out" its mission.

　　Lodge also shamelessly praised the bloody atrocities of the Belgian colonialists in the Congo, saying that the Belgian government "should be congratulated for this."

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche (American) announced in Leopoldville on the 14th that four battalions of UN forces would arrive in the Congo at the beginning of next week.

　　Bunche announced at a press conference that the first group of UN personnel would arrive in Leopoldville within forty-eight hours. He said, "For obvious reasons, the first group of UN troops will probably be composed of troops from African countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Mali (Federation), Morocco, and Tunisia."

　　Bunche said that General Von Horn, the leader of the UN Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem, would serve as his military advisor.

　　On the same day, the spokesman for the UN Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem, Grande, said that in Jerusalem, a group of UN officers were on standby to go to the Congo as advance personnel for the UN forces.

　　Western news agencies reported that this task force of more than one hundred people included officers from Western countries such as Canada, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and New Zealand. This task force will form the core of the UN forces in the Congo.

　　Western news agencies also reported that Von Horn was scheduled to go to the Congo on the 15th.

### 比政府狂妄表示不从刚果撤退侵略军　本奇宣布联合国部队即将到达刚果

　　比政府狂妄表示不从刚果撤退侵略军
　　本奇宣布联合国部队即将到达刚果
    据新华社15日讯　比利时政府昨天在致刚果政府的照会中狂妄表示，比利时将不从刚果撤退它的侵略军队。
    这个照会是在比利时内阁举行通宵会议、对联合国安全理事会关于刚果的决议和刚果政府宣布同比利时断绝外交关系等问题讨论之后发出的。比利时政府在这个照会中表明，比利时侵略军将继续执行“他们目前的任务”，一直到联合国部队能够保证刚果的所谓“安全和公共秩序”为止。
    比利时政府这种嚣张的态度是同美国官方公开采取的方针相一致的。美国驻联合国代表洛奇13日在联合国安理会讨论关于刚果问题的决议时，硬说比利时没有对刚果进行任何侵略，他并且公然对决议中要求比利时从刚果撤退它的侵略军这一点“是否明智”表示“怀疑”。洛奇说，美国投票支持这一决议是由于它“认为”，比利时军队的撤退要看联合国“能否成功地执行”它的任务。
    洛奇还无耻地对比利时殖民主义者在刚果的血腥暴行表示嘉许，他说，比利时政府“为此应当受到祝贺”。
    新华社15日讯　联合国副秘书长本奇（美国人）14日在利奥波德维尔宣布，有四个营的联合国部队将在下星期初到达刚果。
    本奇在记者招待会上宣布，第一批联合国人员将在四十八小时内到达利奥波德维尔。他说，“由于明显的原因，第一批联合国军队大概将是以加纳、几内亚、马里（联邦）、摩洛哥和突尼斯这样一些非洲国家的部队组成的”。
    本奇说，联合国驻耶路撒冷停战监督机构的领导人、瑞典籍的范霍恩将军将充当他的军事顾问。
    同一天，联合国驻耶路撒冷停战监督机构发言人格兰德说，在耶路撒冷，一批联合国军官正在待命作为联合国军队先行人员到刚果去。
    西方通讯社报道，这支为数一百多人的特遣队，其中有加拿大、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、意大利和新西兰等西方国家的军官。这支特遣队将构成在刚果的联合国部队的核心。
    西方通讯社还报道，范霍恩也定在15日到刚果去。
