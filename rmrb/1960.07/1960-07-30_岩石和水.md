Rocks and Water
    Lin Feng, Lu Fuwei

    The severe drought has lasted for more than two hundred days. Mountain ponds have dried up, reservoirs are short of water, and the Dew River has revealed its rocky riverbed... In Linxian County in the Taihang Mountains, Shibanrock Commune has an abundance of rock. Cliffs rise steeply, and crags stand in forests. Where can water be found? "Digging yields only rock, drilling wells brings no spring." This is how the Linxian County Gazetteer describes the people's search for water over thousands of years. However, in an era where the people are masters of their own destiny, history must be rewritten. The people searching for water are on the move. The heroes of Taihang begin a new battle: combat heroes who fought the enemy in guerrilla warfare in the past climb cliffs and cross gullies, pressing their ears to cowhide drums, listening intently to the sound of water under the rock crevices; demolition experts who were skilled at making landmines are preparing materials for blasting mountains and drilling holes, to blast rocks and find springs; the elderly in the Happiness Homes cannot stay idle, and discuss in small groups, unearthing many valuable clues to water sources from their rich memories.

    There is an Ice Cave in Hanjiaao. Every winter, when it's freezing cold, it emits bursts of heat, but in the dog days of summer, pillars of ice hang from it. Legend says that it is the nostril of the Dragon King of the East Sea. A folk song says: "Ice Cave, mouth facing the sky, it is connected to the old dragon's body. Whoever moves the stone and takes the ice will either die or be sick for half a year." But now, people say, "Begging it and worshipping it is of no use, it's too arrogant! Now we can only forcefully pull the Dragon King's nose to make him come down the mountain." More than fifty young people fought bitterly for three days and two nights: long hoes were worn down to short hoes, rocks were struck until sparks flew, and gushing spring water flowed out with a roar...

    The old farmer Li Zhaobi, who led us on the tour, finished telling the story of pulling the dragon's nose, and specially dug into the "nostril" to take out clumps of ice and snow, jokingly saying to us: "If the Dragon King gets angry, you will be responsible!" Looking at his face, beaming with joy because of the victory, I excitedly thought: This is the same Li Zhaobi who had knelt and worshipped in front of the Ice Cave for most of his life, never daring to complain even if the crops were so dry that there was no harvest. But once people have liberated their minds, the slaves of nature become the masters of nature!

    Between the cliffs and precipices, taking water is difficult, but leading water is even more difficult. The members of Gaojiatai Commune managed to cut a channel in the high mountains, but it was blocked by the 27-zhang-wide Bailong (White Dragon) Cliff. People wanted to suspend people with ropes to work in the air, fixing the water turbine pipe on the cliff to lead the water. However, the steep cliff not only stood tall but also extended menacingly outwards. Suspending people with ropes could not approach the cliff face, let alone climb or stand on it. Everyone was worrying about what to do when an old man said: "Where there is a bird path, there is a human path. I am old and useless, let my son Changcun try!"

    The old man's name is Cui Wansheng. Five brothers since childhood chopped firewood and collected herbs in the deep mountains, and developed the ability to fly on cliffs and walk on walls, known as the Five Monkeys of Taihang. This time when Changcun went down the cliff, his fourth uncle Wanhai was responsible for releasing the rope. He flew like an eagle in the sky, his feet touching the rocks from time to time... Five minutes later, he was facing the upper lip of the White Dragon Cliff. He whistled sharply, pulled out a grappling hook and stabbed it at a spot on the cliff, and the rope was released more than ten feet. He flew out several feet, relying on the swinging force of the rope to try his best to swim back. However, the cave was too deep, once, twice... five times he could not swim close to the cliff, Changcun was exhausted, and the rope began to turn. Wanhai quickly loosened the rope and released him to the bottom of the cliff.

    Wansheng encouraged the panting Changcun and said: "If a mountain eagle can enter, so can a human," teaching him to use the "hawk catching chickens" method. When Changcun swam close to the cliff again, he inserted a long pole into the rock crevice and entered the cave along the pole. He nailed steel drills and tied ropes to the stone wall, completing the preparations for the construction of the suspended aqueduct. In this way, people conquered the dangerous White Dragon Cliff with a spirit of fearlessness, courage, and resourcefulness.

    Broken cliffs, sheer walls, high ravines, and deep gullies divide the land into pieces. There is such a joke: a farmer went up the mountain to hoe the field, hoeing and calculating, and after counting, he lost a piece of land. When he finished work, he lifted the straw hat he had placed on the edge of the field, hey! It turned out that the lost piece of land was covered by the straw hat! Of course, jokes are always jokes, but it is very common here for one mu of land to be divided into ten or twenty pieces, and the dispersion and fragmentation of the land have caused many unimaginable difficulties for irrigation. I once visited a "water conservancy dead corner" far away from the water source: the newly emerged seedlings were lush and strong, a lush green. A local cadre said to me triumphantly: "Look, the milk is sufficient, the complexion is good, this is not an orphan without parental care, it is a little baby in a nursery!" I followed the direction he pointed: I saw a few rubber tubes as thick as fingers, hanging high in the treetops, leaning against the rock wall, extending far into the heights. It turned out that this was for the "little baby" to drink milk, and the "milk bottle" was still in a mountain spring more than a thousand meters away!

    Stubborn rocks cannot withstand the strong will of the Taihang people to conquer nature. It is forced to make way and give way, and the gurgling mountain spring flows according to people's wishes, swimming into the ocean of crops. Shibanrock Commune has had a bumper harvest of wheat, and the summer planting area has been expanded by more than 4,000 mu. People have created and are still creating miracles. On the cloud-shrouded mountain peaks, there is a blasting expert named Li Si, an old man, who is fifty-nine years old this year. He was a landmine hero in the past when he fought against the enemy. The apprentices he has trained are all over the county's water conservancy construction sites, but he still wears climbing shoes all day long and wanders around with a steel drill on his back. No matter which commune or team it is, as long as they split mountains and drill holes, people can see him. Blasting is a hard and dangerous job. People love him and respect him, but they are also worried about his old age... When the construction of the Red Flag Canal for diverting the Zhang (River) into Lin (County) started, the organization decided not to allow him to go. But he took his quilt and went to the production team automatically. Everyone coaxed him and said, "There are enough people!" The old man said, "More people, more strength!" Everyone said, "You have many apprentices, isn't it the same as if you are contributing your own strength?" The old man said, "That's true, how can the master fall behind!" After saying this and that, the captain got angry and shouted, "Why don't you old man know what's good or bad, everyone is taking care of you!" This caused trouble, the old man stretched out his muscular hands and shouted, "Hey, bully me because I'm old, come, let's compete in strength!"

    I once asked the old man why he was so "stubborn," which aroused many of his emotions. He pointed to the overlapping Taihang Mountains and said to me: "In the past, we risked our lives and shed blood to protect it, wasn't it just for shedding sweat to transform it today!" Looking at his majestic appearance with his eyebrows and beard raised, I felt a deep respect in my heart. Isn't he the embodiment of thousands of Taihang heroes! This pair of hands that can crush rocks, this pair of hands that have been tempered even stronger in struggle and labor, where is its opponent? The enemy competed with it and was overwhelmed; the drought demon competed with it and was overwhelmed... It is this pair of giant hands that defended the rivers and mountains of the motherland, and now they are rearranging the mountains and rivers. It has written a touching history and is depicting the newest and most beautiful picture...

    岩石和水
    林风　陆拂为
    严重的干旱持续了二百多天，山塘干涸、水库缺水、露水河露出了乱石滩……。太行山区林县石板岩公社石板岩多，削壁高耸、巉岩林立，哪里去取水呢？“掘地尽石，凿井无泉”。林县县志用这样八个字叙述了几千年来人们找水的经过。但是，在人民当家作主的年代，历史必须重新写过。寻找水源的人们出动了，太行英雄开始新的战斗：过去在游击战中和敌人搏斗的战斗英雄攀崖越沟，耳朵紧贴在牛皮鼓上，谛听岩缝下的水声；过去的地雷能手调药配料，准备劈山钻洞，崩石取泉；幸福院的老人都闲不住了，三三两两议论纷纷，从丰富的记忆宝库里发掘出许多宝贵的水源线索。
    韩家坳有个冰冰洞。每逢数九严寒，冒出阵阵热气，但到三伏炎夏，却悬挂柱柱冰凌。相传它是东海龙王的鼻孔。歌谣道：“冰冰洞，口朝天，它和老龙身相连，谁要搬石又取冰，不死也得病半年。”可是现在，人们说：“求它拜它，不理不睬，好大的架子！如今只有硬牵龙王鼻子叫下山。”五十多个青年苦战了三天两夜：长镐磨成了短镐，岩石敲出了火星，汹涌的泉水哗哗流出来了……。
    领我们参观的老农李照壁讲完了牵龙鼻的故事，特意扒到“鼻孔”里去掏出一团团冰雪，和我们开玩笑说：“龙王爷发起脾气来，你可要负责呵！”我望着他那因胜利而喜气洋洋的脸，激动地想：就是这个李照壁，曾在冰冰洞前跪拜过大半辈子哩，哪怕庄稼旱得颗粒无收，也不敢有半句怨言。但当人们一旦解放了思想，大自然的奴隶就变成大自然的主人！
    在悬崖绝壁之间，取水难，引水更难。高家台的社员好容易在高山劈出一道水渠，却给二十七丈宽的白龙崖挡了道。人们想用绳索悬人凌空施工，把水车管固定在绝壁上引水。但是，陡崖不仅高高矗立，还恶森森的向外伸延。绳索悬人也无法接近崖壁，更别提攀登和站脚了。大家正愁得没主意，有个老汉说：“有鸟道就有人道，我年老不中用了，让我儿长存试试吧！”
    老汉名崔万生，兄弟五人自幼在深山打柴采药，练就一身飞崖走壁的本领，人称太行五猴。长存这次下崖头，他四叔万怀负责放绳。只见他像雄鹰样在高空飞翔，双足不时和岩石点碰，……五分钟后，他已和白龙崖的上唇打对面了，他呜地打了声唿哨，抽出抓钩猛地去崖上一点，绳索一下放出丈余，他飞出几丈远，依靠绳索的摆力奋力往回游。但是，崖洞太深了，一次，二次……五次都没能游近崖壁，长存已经精疲力尽，绳子开始倒转。万怀连忙松绳放他到崖根。
    万生鼓励气喘喘的长存说：“山鹰能进，人就能进”，教他用“老鹰抓小鸡”法。当长存又一次游近崖壁时，就用长竿插进岩缝，缘竿进入了岩洞。他在石壁上钉钢钎、系绳索，为架设悬空水渠完成了施工前的准备工作。就这样，人们用大无畏的精神，勇敢机智地征服了艰险的白龙崖。
    断崖，削壁、高壑、深沟，把土地分割得支离破碎。有这样一个笑话：有个农民上山锄地，边锄边算，数来数去丢了一块地。收工时他把放在地头的草帽一揭，嘿！原来丢掉的那块地被草帽盖着哩！当然，笑话总是笑话，但一亩地分成一、二十块在这里却很普遍，土地的分散和零碎给灌溉造成许多难以想像的困难。我曾参观了一个远离水源的“水利死角”：刚出土的幼苗茂盛茁壮、一片葱绿。一位当地干部得意地对我说：“你瞧，奶水足，气色好，这可不是无人抚育的孤儿，是托儿所的小宝宝哩！”我顺着他所指的方向望去：只见几根指头般粗细的胶皮管，高挂树梢，依傍岩壁，一直向高远处伸延。原来，这就是供“小宝宝”喝奶用的，“奶瓶”还在一千多米远的高山泉眼中哩！
    顽固的岩石敌不过太行人民征服自然的坚强的意志。它被迫闪开道、让出路，汩汩的山泉按照人们的愿望奔流，游进庄稼的海洋。石板岩公社小麦丰收了，夏种面积又扩大了四千多亩。人们已经创造和还在创造着奇迹。在白云缭绕的山峰上，有个爆破能手名李四老汉，今年五十九，过去和敌人斗争时是地雷英雄。他培养的徒弟遍布全县各水利工地，但他还成天穿着登山鞋，背着钢钎到处转游，不管哪社哪队，只要劈山钻洞，人们准能看到他。爆破是件艰苦而危险的工作，人们爱他，敬他，但又为他年老担心……当引漳（河）入林（县）的红旗渠开工时，组织上决定不准他去。但他带着被子，自动到生产队去了。众人哄他说：“人手够了！”老汉说：“多个人多出把力！”众人说：“你许多徒弟在，不跟你自己出力一样吗？”老汉说：“真是哩，做师傅的怎能落后！”说来说去，把大队长气急了，嚷道：“你这老汉怎不知好歹，大伙为照顾你哩！”这可惹下祸事了，老汉伸出筋肉累累的大手，嚷道：“嘿，欺我老哩，来，较较手劲！”
    我曾问老汉为什么这样“固执”，引起他很多感慨。他指着重重叠叠的太行山对我说：“过去拚性命流血保卫它，可不就为今天流汗改造它！”我望着他那须眉毕张的雄姿，心里产生一种深深的敬意，在我面前的，岂不是千万太行英雄的化身！这双能使岩石粉碎的手，这双在斗争和劳动中锻炼得更为坚强的手，哪里有它的对手？敌人和它较量过，被压倒了；旱魔和它较量过，被压倒了……正是这双巨人的手，捍卫了祖国的河山，现在又把山河重安排。它书写了可歌可泣的历史，描绘着最新最美的图画……。
