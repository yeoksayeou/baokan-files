Shenyang Agricultural College and Beijing Mining College Link Up with Rural Communes
Combining Teaching and Scientific Research to Comprehensively Support Agriculture

(Our Dispatch) The faculty, students, and staff of Shenyang Agricultural College are actively implementing the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on comprehensively supporting agriculture. Under the correct leadership of the college's Party committee, they have closely integrated teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, setting off a new high tide of a vigorous and large-scale movement to comprehensively support agricultural technological transformation.

Since early February, the college has successively sent more than 2,300 teachers and students to people's communes in the vast rural areas of Liaoning Province. Combining teaching with a wide range of activities to support agricultural technological transformation, they have actively managed existing farms, forest farms, and factories. They have also established more than 20 large "three-way combination" bases (points) in places such as the Daxun River People's Commune in Tieling County and the Taiyangsheng People's Commune in Gaiping County. In these communes, on-site teaching and high-yield experimental fields are conducted to closely integrate teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. At the same time, they disseminate technology, train cadres, promote improved varieties, and guide production, thereby accelerating the realization of agricultural technological transformation tasks. More than 100 teachers and students working in Tieling County, under the leadership of the county Party committee and the commune Party committee, have formulated technical regulations and implementation plans for "10,000-mu high-yield plots" of more than ten major crops such as rice, sorghum, and corn. At the same time, the entire college has formulated a comprehensive development plan for the Gao Kan People's Commune, where it is located. Currently, each department has sent professional working groups to help develop agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production, focusing on vegetables and animal husbandry. Recently, they have helped build a large greenhouse of 2,400 square meters, two fertilizer plants with an annual output of 720 tons, three reservoirs, an agricultural science research institute, and a breeding pig farm capable of raising 500 pigs, laying a good foundation for further development of production.

In the process of comprehensively supporting agriculture, each department has given full play to the role of the "three-way combination" bases for teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, learning and supporting simultaneously, which has not only improved themselves but also contributed to agricultural development. Teachers and students of the Agronomy Department working at the "three-way combination" base of the Taiyangsheng People's Commune in Gaiping County have humbly learned from the farmers' experience, conducted in-depth investigations and research, and helped the commune formulate technical measures for various major crops. In the countryside, after investigation and research, teachers and students wrote and printed nine scientific papers and investigation reports, such as "Investigation Report on Potato Sprouting in Heated Beds," which played a significant role in guiding current production. More than 100 teachers and students from the Plant Protection Department formed 19 groups and vigorously carried out the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests in various districts, counties, and communes under the jurisdiction of Shenyang City. They also jointly created and successfully modified five tools with the commune members, such as "hand-pushed seedling dusting carts." In addition, they have also successfully researched "sheep manure and lime insecticide liquid" and other native pesticides, which have a good killing effect on pests such as aphids and beetles, and have no drug damage.

In order to realize the ideal of "raising pigs without grain," the Department of Soil and Agricultural Chemistry and the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine have jointly researched and successfully used chlorella and chain-bubble mold to replace grain for pig raising.

In recent months, the college has also held more than ten professional and more than 40 training courses for various cities, counties, and rural people's communes in Liaoning Province, training more than 3,500 grassroots leading cadres and agricultural technical backbones.

The vast number of teachers and students have also learned rich perceptual knowledge and received practical training in the movement to support agricultural technological transformation, and have significantly improved in terms of political and ideological awareness and work ability. More than 70 graduates from the Department of Agricultural Economics completed the planning and design tasks for a total of 44,000 hectares of land for the Guanghui Livestock Farm and the Qingduizi Livestock Farm in one month. They also wrote more than 30 high-quality papers and the book "Livestock Farm Land Planning."

Currently, the Party committee of Shenyang Agricultural College has formulated a specific plan to comprehensively support agricultural technological transformation. All teachers and students are determined to make outstanding achievements to support agriculture.

(Our Dispatch) The agricultural support team of Beijing Mining College, consisting of more than a thousand teachers and students and workers from affiliated factories, recently went to the people's communes in Changping and Yanqing counties on the outskirts of Beijing to help the communes build factories, repair agricultural machinery, and train technical forces.

The agricultural support team of this college has achieved remarkable results in less than two months after arriving at the communes. They have established a foundry workshop for each of the Chengguan and Nankou communes in Changping, built a mechanical repair factory for Yanqing County, and completed more than 160 technical innovation projects around the manufacture of small agricultural machinery, such as iron shears, pedal lathes, and cold hammers. They have successfully trial-produced and promoted more than a dozen simple machines for agricultural tools and cooker improvement projects, such as land levelers, seeders, and vegetable cutting machines. In addition, students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering repaired more than 40 boiler-towing machines urgently needed for spring irrigation for the communes, teachers and students from the Department of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering repaired a small power station for the state-owned fish farm in Yanqing County, and teachers and students from the Department of Geology also found urgently needed coal deposits for the local communes.

In organizing technical forces to support agriculture, the Party committee of Beijing Mining College first focused on helping the communes build and renovate factories to solve the important link of repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools. The Mafang Agricultural Tool Factory in Nankou Commune, Changping County, originally had only two native lathes and one blower, and all but one lathe operator were newly transferred farmers. With the help of teachers, students, and workers from the Mining College, the agricultural tool factory established a foundry workshop and cast more than 200 castings necessary for expanding the factory in just one month, and trained 12 technicians who can operate independently from the commune members. At present, this factory has taken on the task of repairing and manufacturing small agricultural tools.

In order to train technical forces for the communes, the Party Committee of the Mining College sent teachers, students, and workers to the communes, and through ways such as opening training classes, learning from teachers, taking apprentices, and making friends, sent technology to the door, helping commune members master and improve their technical level. On the other hand, they also adopted the method of inviting people in, where young commune members were selected by the communes to go to the school's affiliated factories for concentrated and longer-term training, cultivating a large number of technical talents for the communes. The teachers and students participating in agricultural technological transformation in the Changping Commune also compiled five kinds of popular lectures for the commune members, such as "Maintenance and Repair of Boiler-Towing Machines" and "Casting Technology," and held short-term training classes, training 66 workers in various types of work and more than 200 boiler-towing machine operators for the commune.

The teachers and students of the agricultural support team also participated in the commune's field labor. Under the hands-on guidance of the commune members, they learned a lot of agricultural technology and completed more than 5,000 mu of land leveling, sowing, fertilization and other production tasks with the commune members.

On the existing basis, the Party Committee of the Mining College is further linking up with the communes in Changping and Yanqing counties to jointly formulate plans for developing commune-run industries and sign contracts in order to establish a fixed and long-term cooperative relationship so as to better support agriculture.

    沈阳农学院和北京矿业学院同农村公社挂钩
    结合教学、科学研究全面支援农业
    本报讯　沈阳农学院全体师生员工，积极贯彻中共沈阳市委关于全面支援农业的决议，在院党委的正确领导下，紧密结合教学、科学研究和生产劳动，掀起了一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的全面支援农业技术改造运动的新高潮。
    从2月上旬以来，该校就陆续派出两千三百多名师生，到辽宁省广大农村人民公社，结合教学广泛开展各种各样的支援农业技术改造的活动。除积极办好现有的农场、林场和工厂外，还在铁岭县大汛河人民公社和盖平县太阳升人民公社等处建立了二十多个较大的“三结合”基地（点）。在这些公社内，进行现场教学和高额丰产试验，使教学、科学研究和生产劳动密切结合起来，同时传播技术、培训干部、推广良种、指导生产，从而加速实现农业技术改造任务。在铁岭县工作的一百多名师生，在县委和公社党委的领导下，已制订出水稻、高粱、玉米等十余种主要作物的“万亩丰产方”的技术规程和实施方案。与此同时，全院又制订出所在公社——高坎人民公社全面发展的规划。目前，各系都派出了专业工作组，帮助发展以蔬菜和畜牧为主的农、林、牧、副、渔五业生产。最近，他们已帮助建成一座二千四百平方米的大型温室，两座年产七百二十吨化肥的肥料厂、三座水库、一所农业科学研究所、一所能饲养五百头猪的种猪场，为进一步发展生产奠定了良好基础。
    在全面支援农业过程中，各系都充分发挥了教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合基地作用，边学习边支援，既提高了自己，又对农业发展做出了贡献。农学系在盖平县太阳升人民公社“三结合”基地工作的师生，虚心学习农民的经验，深入调查研究，帮助公社制订出各种主要作物的技术措施。在农村，师生们经过调查研究，写出并印发了“土豆火炕育芽的调查报告”等九篇科学论文和调查报告，对指导当前生产起了很大作用。植物保护系一百多名师生，组成十九个小组，在沈阳市管辖内的各区、县、社大力开展作物病虫害的防治工作。他们还与社员共同创造和改制成功了“手推式苗期撒粉车”等五种工具。此外，还研究成功“羊粪小灰杀虫液”等土农药，对蚜虫、金龟子等害虫的杀伤效果很好，且无药害。
    为了实现“养猪不用粮”的理想，土壤农化系和畜牧兽医系共同研究成功了用小球藻和链泡霉代替粮食养猪。
    近几个月来，该院还为辽宁省各市、县和广大农村人民公社举办了十余个专业、四十多次训练班，培训三千五百多名基层领导干部和农业技术骨干。
    广大师生，在支援农业技术改造运动中，也学到了丰富的感性知识，得到了实际锻炼，在政治思想觉悟和工作能力等方面都有了显著提高。农业经济系七十余名本届毕业生，在一个月的时间内，就完成了光辉畜牧场和青堆子畜牧场共四万四千公顷土地的规划设计任务。并写出了三十多篇质量较高的论文和“畜牧场土地规划”一书。
    目前，沈阳农学院党委已制订出全面支援农业技术改造的具体规划，全体师生员工决心用出色成绩，为支援农业立功。
    本报讯　北京矿业学院由千余名师生及附属工厂工人所组成的支援农业大队，最近分赴京郊昌平、延庆两县的人民公社，帮助公社兴建工厂，检修农业机械，培养技术力量。
    这个学院的支援农业大队到达公社后，不到两个月的时间已取得了显著的成绩。他们为昌平城关、南口两个公社各建立起了一个铸工车间，为延庆县建立起一座机械修配厂，并完成了围绕小型农业机械制造的技术革新项目如剪铁机、脚踏车床、冷锤等一百六十多件；试制成功并已推广使用的农具及炊具改革项目如平地机、点种机、切菜机等简易机械达数十余项。此外，机械系的学生还为公社修复了四十余台春灌急需用的锅驼机，机电系的师生为延庆县的国营鱼场修复了一座小型发电站，地质系的师生还为当地公社找到了迫切需要的煤藏。
    北京矿业学院党委在组织技术力量支援农业的工作中，首先抓住了帮助公社兴建和改建工厂，以解决农具的修配与制造这一重要环节。昌平县南口公社的马坊农具厂，原来只有两台土车床和一台鼓风机，除一名车工外，其余都是新调来的农民。这个农具厂在矿业学院的师生和工人的帮助下，建立起了铸工车间，仅在一个月内就浇铸出二百多件为扩建工厂所必需的铸件，并从社员中培养出了十二名能进行独立操作的技术员。目前，这个厂子已担负起修配和制造小型农具的任务。
    为了给公社培养技术力量，矿业学院党委一方面派出师生和工人到公社，通过开训练班、拜师傅、带徒弟、交朋友等方式把技术送上门，帮助社员掌握与提高技术水平；一方面还采取了请进来的办法，由公社选送青年社员到学校附属工厂进行集中的、较长时间的培训，为公社培养了大批的技术人材。在昌平参加公社农业技术改造的师生，还为社员编写了“锅驼机维护与检修”、“铸工工艺学”等五种通俗讲义，并开办了短期训练班，为公社培养了各工种工人六十六名，锅驼机手二百余名。
    支援农业大队的师生还参加了公社的田间劳动，在社员手把着手的教导下，他们学会了许多农业技术，并与社员一起完成了五千多亩地的平整、播种、施肥等生产任务。
    矿业学院党委在现有的基础上，正进一步与昌平、延庆两县的公社挂钩，共同制定发展社办工业的规划，签定合同，以建立固定的、长期的协作关系，以便更好的支援农业。　　　　　　（彭应禄）（附图片）
