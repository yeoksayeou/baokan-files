    In the Factory Supporting Wheat Harvesting
    Worker of Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Ma Yande
    Hammering sickles deep into the night, the leaping sparks light up the window, loud voices at the door, trucks coming one after another. Swinging the hammer, shaking the beams, sweat dripping all over, ten thousand golden flowers reflecting smiling faces, shiny sickles filling the trucks. The trucks fly to the fields, the room is full of clanging sounds, distant songs carried by the wind, the clanging sounds fly far away.

    The wheat king, the cyclist returning in the firelight, holding wheat ears, laughing, "Comrades, come and see, the commune members sent a wheat king!" The wheat king, two feet long, grains golden like rolling beads, you pass it to him, he passes it to me, making everyone laugh happily.
  "The wheat king grows full of thousands of acres, waiting for the new knives to harvest." Tens of thousands of sparks fly up, ten thousand new knives loaded onto the trucks.

    在支援麦收工厂里
    丰台机务段工人　马延德
    打镰刀深更半夜叮当响，跳跃的火花映红窗，门口人声高声嚷，车子一辆又一辆。抡起铁锤震颤梁，浑身上下汗水淌，万朵金花映笑脸，银亮的镰刀满车装。车子飞向田野去，屋里一片响叮当，远处歌声风送来，叮当的声音飞远方。
    小麦王骑车人回来在火光下，捧着麦穗笑哈哈，“同志们快来看哟，社员送给一个小麦王”。小麦王，二尺长，粒粒金黄滚珠样，你传他来他传我，喜的大家笑呵呵。
  “小麦王长满千顷田，等着新刀去收割。”火花飞起几万朵，万把新刀装上车。
