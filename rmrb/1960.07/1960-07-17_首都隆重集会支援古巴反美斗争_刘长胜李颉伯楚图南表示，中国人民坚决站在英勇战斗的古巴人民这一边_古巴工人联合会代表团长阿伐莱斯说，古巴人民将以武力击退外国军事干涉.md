Xinhua News Agency, 16th: More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this afternoon to resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people against interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism, and warmly welcome the delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation.

　　Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his opening speech at the meeting: The 650 million Chinese people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, firmly stand on the side of the Cuban people and will always support each other and cooperate closely in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

　　The meeting was held in the Music Hall of Zhongshan Park. At 3 p.m., Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ningyi, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Latin American Friendship Association, Chu Tunan, and other Chinese guests, along with the head of the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation, Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Federation, Odon Avales de la Campa, and other Cuban guests, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, more than 3,000 people in the audience burst into thunderous applause, expressing their highest respect and resolute support to the Cuban people who are fighting tit-for-tat against U.S. imperialism.

　　The meeting was presided over by Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In his opening speech, he extended his highest respects on behalf of the people of the capital to the Cuban people who are engaged in a heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism, and extended the warmest welcome to the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation, representatives of the heroic Cuban workers from the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle. He said: U.S. imperialism is stepping up its planning to launch a new military adventure against the Cuban people, which has further aroused the righteous indignation of the Cuban people and the people of all countries in the world, and further united them to carry out a more powerful struggle against U.S. imperialism. If U.S. imperialism dares to risk the world's condemnation and insists on carrying out military aggression against the sacred territory of the Cuban people, then it will surely play with fire and burn itself to death in the raging fire of the Cuban people's resistance struggle.

　　Liu Changsheng said: The joint statement signed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Cuban Workers' Federation this morning fully expresses the fraternal friendship between the workers of China and Cuba in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, expresses the common belief of the workers of China and Cuba in the victory of the common cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace, and expresses the common desire to support each other and strengthen unity in future struggles. The signing of this joint statement also marks a new stage in the development of friendly relations between the workers and trade unions of China and Cuba.

　　Liu Changsheng said: The 650 million Chinese people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, firmly stand on the side of the Cuban people and will always support each other and cooperate closely in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. The revolutionary cause of the Cuban people will surely achieve the final victory. The just cause of the people of the world to safeguard peace and oppose wars of aggression will surely achieve the final victory.

　　Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke. He said: "We assure the Cuban people that in your just struggle against interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism, you can always count on the full support of the 650 million Chinese people."

　　Li Jiebo highly praised the victory of the Cuban people's revolution. He said: Under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the Cuban people, after a long and arduous struggle, finally achieved the brilliant victory of overthrowing the Batista dictatorial regime fostered by U.S. imperialism, and began to take a series of major measures to safeguard national sovereignty and carry out economic and social reforms, achieving remarkable achievements. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution once again proves that as long as we persist in the struggle, we can certainly defeat imperialism and win the victory of national independence.

　　Li Jiebo said: The revolutionary flame of the Cuban people has illuminated the path for the people of Latin America to maintain and strive for national independence, strive for democracy and freedom, and develop national economy. Encouraged by the victory of the Cuban people's revolution, the flames of national and democratic movements have been ignited everywhere in Latin America; the tide of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is sweeping across the entire Latin America. Precisely because of this, U.S. imperialism hates the victory of the Cuban people so deeply and tries every means to strangle the Cuban revolution, drag the Cuban people back into the abyss of slavery and oppression, and vainly attempt to extinguish the national and democratic movement in Latin America. Since the victory of the Cuban revolution, U.S. imperialism has never stopped its criminal activities of sabotaging the Cuban revolution and subverting the Cuban revolutionary government. In recent times, because Cuba has insisted on implementing policies that conform to the interests of the nation, U.S. imperialism's activities of interfering in and invading Cuba have become even more intensified. It is implementing economic and political blockades against Cuba and is actively planning armed intervention militarily.

　　He emphasized: However, no threat or conspiracy of interference by U.S. imperialism can make the Cuban people, who have embarked on the path of independence and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, submit. Every new threat and provocation can only arouse more fierce opposition and more resolute revolutionary struggle from the Cuban people.

　　Li Jiebo said: The struggle of the Cuban people is by no means isolated. The just cause of the Cuban people has received the deep sympathy and full support of the people of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the peace-loving people of the world. The just cry of "Cuba yes, Yankees no" has resounded throughout Latin America. Under the banner of defending the Cuban revolution, the people of Latin America have launched a wide-ranging mass movement, effectively promoting the struggle of various Latin American countries to maintain and strive for national independence, defend national sovereignty and national resources, strive for democracy and freedom, and oppose interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world firmly stand on the side of the Cuban people and support their just struggle. The criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in interfering in and invading Cuba have been condemned more and more strongly by the people of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the world.

　　Li Jiebo said: The Chinese people have always regarded the just struggle of the Cuban people as their own struggle and regard every victory of the Cuban people as their own victory. The 650 million Chinese people fully support every struggle of the Cuban people to maintain national independence and oppose U.S. imperialist interference. The Chinese people have also gained strength to encourage themselves from the struggle of the Cuban people.

　　Li Jiebo said: The current world situation is increasingly favorable to the cause of people of all countries in striving for lasting peace, national independence, democracy, freedom, and socialism. The storm of the world's people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has risen and is constantly expanding. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the national and democratic forces of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the strength of the people's struggles in Western countries, and the strength of peace-loving forces throughout the world are constantly developing and growing. U.S. imperialism is increasingly isolated in the face of the people of the world, and their lives will not be too long. As long as the people of all countries further unite, heighten their vigilance, and resolutely struggle, they will surely be able to continuously frustrate the aggressive policies and war policies of U.S. imperialism, and enable the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress to achieve final victory.

　　Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Latin American Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting. He said: In order to restore its colonial rule in Cuba, U.S. imperialism has exhausted all kinds of heinous means, crudely interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and undermining the Cuban revolution. These conspiracies will not succeed. Now, it is using the despicable trick of economic blockade, thinking that by not buying Cuban sugar and not refining oil for Cuba, it can strangle the Cuban revolution and force the Cuban people to submit. This is of course a fool's dream. Every conspiracy activity and shameless interference by U.S. imperialism only arouse greater anger from the Cuban people, exposing the ugly and brutal face of U.S. imperialism. The Cuban government and people resolutely fight back against the economic and political pressure and interference of U.S. imperialism, confiscate the enterprises of U.S. imperialism, and work hard on economic construction through self-reliance. The Cuban people are further widely mobilized to prepare to crush the various conspiracy activities of U.S. imperialism.

　　Chu Tunan said: The Cuban people's resolute struggle against the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism has set a brilliant example in the world and is an extremely important force for the people of the world to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression policies and defend world peace. The Cuban workers are playing a vanguard role in this great struggle against U.S. imperialism. He expressed his highest respect on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Latin American Friendship Association to the Cuban worker brothers and the heroic Cuban people.

　　Chu Tunan said: On the common front against U.S. imperialist aggression, the people of China and Cuba have forged a deep friendship. The struggle of the Cuban people is our struggle, and the victory of the Cuban people is also our victory. We firmly support the just anti-U.S. struggle of the Cuban people.

　　Chu Tunan finally said: No matter what brutal means and criminal conspiracy activities U.S. imperialism wants to take, U.S. imperialism must eventually fail, and victory must belong to the united, strong, and unyielding heroic Cuban people.

　　The head of the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation, Avales, was invited to speak, and the venue was filled with lasting warm applause. The head of the delegation said that on behalf of the Cuban Workers' Federation, the Cuban people, and the Cuban revolutionary government, they expressed their deepest gratitude to the Chinese workers and people for their tremendous support and sympathy for Cuba and the Cuban revolution.

　　After talking about the victory of the Cuban revolution and the tremendous achievements made in various aspects after the victory, Avales pointed out that the U.S. monopoly capital and the Washington government that serve the monopoly capital hate the Cuban revolution and desperately want to strangle our country economically and immerse the Cuban people's struggle to defend national independence and sovereignty in blood. They are using various economic, political, diplomatic, and military aggressive methods to deal with our country, and at the same time, they shamelessly accused Cuba of invading the most powerful country in the capitalist world in terms of military and industry in diplomatic notes.

　　Avales emphasized: But the Cuban people are not afraid, they firmly resist all kinds of threats, aggressions, and pressures. The militia composed of workers, farmers, and students is being trained and prepared to use force to repel any foreign military intervention in our country.

　　Avales said that the Cuban people are not isolated in this struggle. Together with them are the people of Latin American, Asia, and Africa, the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the great Chinese people. The tremendous support that the Chinese people have shown for our revolution is of great importance.

　　Avales said that the joint statement signed by Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation that I have the honor to lead is of great importance. The agreement we have reached on mutual assistance is helpful to our struggle against foreign imperialist interference in our country, as well as the entire struggle against imperialist aggression anywhere in the world - Taiwan, Congo, Algeria, Japan, Korea.

　　He said that the whole of Cuba is standing up and preparing to fight against foreign aggression. International support from the people of all countries is of decisive importance today. The workers and people of Cuba and China have joined hands like brothers and united in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. We know that as long as we fight and get international support, we can win.

　　All the speeches at the meeting were very warmly welcomed.

　　After the speeches, the meeting passed a telegram in thunderous applause, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialist interference. Four Young Pioneers ran onto the rostrum and presented flowers to Odon Avales de la Campa and other Cuban guests.

　　Today's meeting was jointly organized by the China Latin American Friendship Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. People from all walks of life in the capital, Zhu Xuefan, Li Dequan, Lao She, Zhou Erfu, Wang Jiong, Zhang Chao, etc., participated in the meeting. Foreign guests from Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are in Beijing were invited to participate in today's meeting. (Attached picture)

　　首都隆重集会支援古巴反美斗争
　　刘长胜李颉伯楚图南表示，中国人民坚决站在英勇战斗的古巴人民这一边
    古巴工人联合会代表团长阿伐莱斯说，古巴人民将以武力击退外国军事干涉
    新华社16日讯　首都各界人民三千多人今天下午举行盛大集会，坚决支援古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的正义斗争，热烈欢迎古巴工人联合会代表团。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在大会上致开会词中说：六亿五千万中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决站在古巴人民这一边，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，将永远互相支持，密切合作。
    大会在中山公园音乐堂举行。下午三时，习仲勋副总理，陈叔通副委员长，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，中国人民对外文化协会会长、中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南等，同古巴工人联合会代表团团长、古巴工人联合会对外关系书记奥东·阿伐莱斯·德·拉·坎巴等古巴外宾走上主席台。这时，全场三千多人发出暴风雨般的掌声，向同美帝国主义进行针锋相对斗争的古巴人民，表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。
    大会由中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜主持，他在致开会词中，代表首都各界人民向正在为维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略而进行英勇斗争的古巴人民表示崇高的致意，对来自反美斗争最前线的英雄的古巴工人兄弟的代表古巴工人联合会代表团表示最热烈的欢迎。他说：美帝国主义正加紧策划对古巴人民发动新的军事冒险，这就更加激起了古巴人民和全世界各国人民的义愤，使他们进一步团结起来，同美帝国主义进行更强大的斗争。美帝国主义如果胆敢冒天下之大不韪，硬要对古巴人民神圣的国土进行军事侵略，那末它必将玩火自焚，被烧死在古巴人民反抗斗争的烈火中。
    刘长胜说：今天上午中华全国总工会与古巴工人联合会所签署的联合声明，充分地表达了中古两国工人在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中的兄弟般的友谊，表示了中古两国工人对反对帝国主义、维护世界和平的共同事业的胜利信念，表达了在今后斗争中相互支持、加强团结的共同愿望。这一联合声明的签署也标志着中古两国工人与工会友好关系发展的新阶段。
    刘长胜说：六亿五千万中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决站在古巴人民这一边，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，将永远互相支持，密切合作。古巴人民的革命事业，一定会取得最后的胜利。全世界人民维护和平、反对侵略战争的正义事业，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯讲话。他说：“我们向古巴人民保证，在你们反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略的正义斗争中，你们永远可以指望得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。”
    李颉伯高度地评价了古巴人民革命的胜利。他说：古巴人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理的领导下，经过了长期艰巨的斗争，终于取得了推翻美帝国主义豢养的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的辉煌胜利，并开始采取了一系列维护民族主权、进行经济与社会改革的重大措施，取得了显著的成就。古巴人民革命的胜利再一次证明了只要坚持进行斗争，就一定可以击败帝国主义，取得民族独立的胜利。
    李颉伯说：古巴人民的革命火焰照亮了拉丁美洲人民维护和争取民族独立、争取民主自由、发展民族经济的道路。在古巴人民革命胜利的鼓舞下，拉丁美洲到处燃起了民族民主运动的火焰；反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争浪潮正在席卷着整个拉丁美洲。正因为如此，美帝国主义才如此刻骨地仇恨古巴人民的胜利，千方百计地企图扼杀古巴革命，把古巴人民重新拖回被奴役被压迫的灾难深渊里，并妄想扑灭拉丁美洲民族民主运动。从古巴革命胜利以来，美帝国主义一刻也没有停止过它破坏古巴革命、颠覆古巴革命政府的罪恶活动。最近时期，由于古巴坚持实行符合民族利益的政策，美帝国主义干涉和侵略古巴的活动更加变本加厉了。它正在从经济上和政治上对古巴实行封锁，在军事上积极策划武装干涉。
    他强调说：但是，美帝国主义任何威胁和干涉阴谋都不能使已经走上独立道路并坚决维护国家主权的古巴人民屈服。每一个新的威胁和挑衅只能激起古巴人民的更加猛烈的反对和更加坚决的革命斗争。
    李颉伯说：古巴人民的斗争决不是孤立的。古巴人民的正义事业得到拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲和全世界爱好和平的人民的深切同情和全力支持。整个拉丁美洲都响起了
  “要古巴，不要美国佬”的正义吼声。在保卫古巴革命的旗帜下，拉丁美洲人民开展了广泛的群众运动，有力地推动了拉丁美洲各国维护和争取民族独立、保卫民族主权和国家资源、争取民主自由和反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的斗争。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民坚决站在古巴人民一边，支持他们的正义斗争。美帝国主义干涉和侵略古巴的罪恶活动受到拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的越来越强烈的谴责。
    李颉伯说：中国人民一向把古巴人民的正义斗争看作自己的斗争，把古巴人民的每一胜利看作自己的胜利。六亿五千万中国人民全力支持古巴人民维护民族独立和反对美帝国主义干涉而进行的每一个斗争。中国人民也从古巴人民的斗争中获得了鼓舞自己的力量。
    李颉伯说：目前的世界形势对于各国人民争取持久和平、民族独立、民主、自由和社会主义的事业越来越有利。世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴已经兴起并且不断扩大，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量，拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲的民族民主力量，西方各国人民斗争的力量，全世界爱好和平的力量正在不断发展和壮大。美帝国主义在全世界人民面前日益孤立，他们的寿命不会太长了。只要各国人民进一步团结起来，提高警惕，坚决斗争，就一定能够不断挫败美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，使保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业取得最后的胜利。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长、中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南在会上讲话。他说：美帝国主义为了恢复它在古巴的殖民主义统治用尽了各式各样的穷凶极恶的手段，粗暴干涉古巴内政破坏古巴革命，这些阴谋都不会得逞。现在，它又用经济封锁的卑鄙伎俩，以为不买古巴的糖，不给古巴提炼石油就能扼杀古巴革命，迫使古巴人民屈服。这当然是痴人的梦想。美帝国主义每一次阴谋活动和无耻干涉只引起了古巴人民更大的愤怒，识破美帝国主义的丑恶而残暴的面目，古巴政府和人民对美帝国主义的经济和政治压力和干涉，坚决展开反击，没收美帝国主义的企业，用自力更生的办法努力从事经济建设。古巴全国人民正进一步广泛动员起来准备粉碎美帝国主义的各种阴谋活动。
    楚图南说：古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略和战争政策的坚决斗争，已在全世界树立了一个光辉的榜样，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略政策、保卫世界和平的一支极为重要的力量。古巴工人在这个伟大的反对美帝国主义斗争当中，起着先锋的作用。他代表中国人民对外文化协会和中国拉丁美洲友好协会对古巴工人兄弟和英雄的古巴人民表示崇高的敬意。
    楚图南说：在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同战线上，中古两国人民已结成了深厚的友谊，古巴人民的斗争就是我们的斗争，古巴人民的胜利也是我们的胜利，我们坚决支持古巴人民的反美的正义斗争。
    楚图南最后说：不管美帝国主义还要采取什么残暴的手段和罪恶的阴谋活动，美帝国主义最后一定要失败的，胜利一定属于团结一致坚强不屈的英雄的古巴人民。
    古巴工人联合会代表团长阿伐莱斯应邀讲话，这时会场响起经久不息的热烈掌声。团长说，他们代表古巴工人联合会、古巴人民和古巴的革命政府，对于中国工人和人民对古巴及古巴的革命所表现的巨大支持和同情表示我们最深切的谢意。
    阿伐莱斯在谈到了古巴革命的胜利和在胜利以后在各方面所取得的巨大成就以后指出，美国大垄断资本及为垄断资本服务的华盛顿政府对古巴革命深恶痛绝，拼命想要从经济上来扼杀我们的国家，想把古巴人民保卫民族独立和主权的斗争浸没在血泊里。他们在用各种经济、政治、外交、军事侵略的办法来对付我国，同时在外交的照会里还厚颜无耻地指责古巴侵略了这个资本主义世界中军事和工业最强大的国家。
    阿伐莱斯强调说：但是古巴人民并不害怕，他们坚定地抗击各种威胁、侵略和压力。工人、农民、学生组成的民兵在受训，准备以武力来击退任何外国对我国的军事干涉。
    阿伐莱斯说，古巴人民在这斗争中不是孤立的，和他们一起的有拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲的人民，有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的人民，有伟大的中国人民，中国人民对我们革命所表示的巨大的支援是有极大的重要意义的。
    阿伐莱斯说，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一和我荣幸领导的古巴工人联合会代表团共同签署的联合声明是有极大的重要意义的。我们之间达成互相帮助的协议，对于我们反对外国帝国主义在我国的干涉的斗争，以及反对帝国主义在世界任何地方的侵略——台湾、刚果、阿尔及利亚、日本、朝鲜——的整个斗争中，都是有帮助的。
    他说，全古巴都站起来准备为反对外国侵略而战斗。各国人民的国际支援今天有决定性的重要意义。古巴和中国的工人和人民兄弟般携起手来了，在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中团结起来了。我们知道，只要我们进行斗争和取得国际支援，我们就能胜利。
    在大会上的所有讲话都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    讲话以后，大会在雷动的掌声中通过通电，坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉的正义斗争。四名少年先锋队员跑上主席台，向奥东·阿伐莱斯·德·拉·坎巴等古巴外宾，献了鲜花。
    今天的大会是由中国拉丁美洲友好协会和中华全国总工会联合举办的。首都各方面的人士朱学范、李德全、老舍、周而复、王炯、张超等，参加了大会。正在北京的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的各国外宾，应邀参加了今天的大会。（附图片）
