    Hongqi Commune Chemical Plant Obtains Materials Locally and Utilizes Resources Comprehensively
    Raw Material Problems Resolved; Factory Production Develops at High Speed
    (Our Dispatch) The Hongqi People's Commune Chemical Plant in Zhengzhou conscientiously implemented the policy of "obtaining materials locally and utilizing resources comprehensively," which solved the problem of raw materials and enabled the factory to continuously expand and consolidate.
    This factory is located on more than one hundred mu of barren saline-alkali land. Before the establishment of the commune, twelve elderly people aged fifty to over eighty built two thatched sheds here to boil saltpeter. Since the establishment of the Hongqi People's Commune, this natural resource has been fully utilized, and the saltpeter boiling team has been expanded into a chemical plant, absorbing a large number of street women to participate in production. The principle of "obtaining materials locally and utilizing resources comprehensively" was adopted. Now this factory has nearly a hundred simple factory buildings and twelve workshops including sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and water glass, with more than 180 employees. The monthly output value has increased from 2,000 yuan when it was a saltpeter boiling team to more than 200,000 yuan now. Many of the 52 products are "zero-cost products," so the factory accumulates very quickly, accounting for more than 50% of the total industrial accumulation of the Hongqi Commune.
    More than one hundred mu of saline-alkali land has become a "treasure bowl" that is "inexhaustible and inexhaustible." The factory relies on this land for 85% of its raw materials. In the past, the saltpeter boiling team only produced one kind of saltpeter. Now, due to comprehensive utilization, the saltpeter itself produces nine products such as explosives, nitric acid, ferrous sulfate, and mirabilite. The by-products of saltpeter, bittern and small salt, can be used to produce more than 20 new products. These new products are almost all more valuable and more widely used than bittern and small salt. For example, the bittern that used to be dumped is made into industrial hydrochloric acid, and its residue is made into magnesium oxide, and the residue of magnesium oxide is made into potassium chloride for chemical analysis. Thirteen products, including soda ash, water glass, and high-grade hydrochloric acid, which are important raw materials in chemical raw materials, have been successfully trial-produced from another by-product of saltpeter, small salt. The factory's Party branch proposed to all employees: to achieve "no waste water, no waste gas, no waste residue," and to make every piece of soil on the saline-alkali land serve socialist construction.
    The factory firmly implements the policy of "obtaining materials locally and utilizing resources comprehensively," and at the same time combines comprehensive utilization with technological innovation. In the early stage of the factory's construction, many elderly people did not believe in comprehensive utilization, and young people doubted that this saline-alkali land could build their ideal high-rise buildings. The factory branch did not adopt a general critical attitude, but first organized a technological innovation team including the factory director, branch secretary, activists, and technicians, and sent a group of employees to study in other places. Then, it established its own small laboratory, purchased simple chemical books, and asked everyone to study hard and delve deeply, first broadening their horizons and understanding what the chemical industry is. Then, a loud slogan was put forward: think it out, do it, fail, and try again. Encourage employees not to be afraid of difficulties, not to be afraid of failure, and to create boldly. Making hydrochloric acid from the by-product of saltpeter, bittern, was the first shot of comprehensive utilization. When building the hydrochloric acid furnace, it failed several times. The technical team and the majority of employees sat down together to study and analyze the reasons for the failure, and used suction water to replace the blower and anthracite briquettes to replace bituminous coal, modified the furnace type, and adjusted the temperature, and finally succeeded in the experiment. The first success boosted the enthusiasm of all employees, and in a short period of time, more than 1,000 rationalization proposals for comprehensive utilization were put forward. When they discovered that the newly made hydrochloric acid residue was a white and fine powder, they studied and experimented with books in one hand and the residue in the other, and as a result, magnesium oxide was produced. The residue of magnesium oxide was not discarded, and experiments were carried out to produce potassium chloride. The final residue plus talc powder became shoe powder welcomed by department stores. The comprehensive utilization of bittern broke the employees' "mysterious" concept of the chemical industry, and enabled them to boldly turn to the comprehensive utilization of another by-product of saltpeter, small salt. After that, the main product, saltpeter, was comprehensively utilized. In this way, the factory formed a comprehensive utilization situation of "three dragons" of saltpeter, bittern, and small salt, and the more fully the three are comprehensively utilized, the more they promote each other, and the more promising the comprehensive utilization is. Recently, they have successfully trial-produced sulfuric acid with several by-products, and sulfuric acid is one of the important raw materials that cannot be lacking in the comprehensive utilization of the three.
    Now, "obtaining materials locally and utilizing resources comprehensively" has become a truly mass activity. Many employees carry chemical industry books in their pockets all day long, and do not let go of any by-product, and study and experiment with it in accordance with the books. "Ask for new products from all by-products" has become a unified slogan for all employees. The factory plans to ask for more than 50 new products from saltpeter, bittern, small salt, and mirabilite this year. In order to carry out comprehensive utilization on a larger scale and under better conditions, a mechanization and semi-mechanization technological innovation movement is underway in this factory.

    红旗公社化工厂就地取材综合利用
    原材料问题得到解决　工厂生产高速度发展
    本报讯　郑州市红旗人民公社化工厂，认真的贯彻了“就地取材，综合利用”的方针，解决了原材料问题，使工厂不断扩大巩固。
    这个工厂座落在一百多亩寸草不生的硝土空地上，成立公社以前，有十二个五十岁到八十多岁的老年人，搭两间草棚在这里熬硝。自从红旗人民公社建立后，就充分利用起这块天然财富，把熬硝组扩大为化工厂，吸收大批街道妇女参加生产，采取了“就地取材，综合利用”的办厂原则。现在这个厂已经拥有近百间简易厂房和硫酸、盐酸、烧碱、水玻璃等十二个车间，一百八十多名职工，月产值由熬硝组时的二千元提高到现在的二十多万元，在五十二种产品中，有许多是属于“不要成本的产品”，因此，这个厂积累很快，占整个红旗公社工业积累的50％以上。
    一百多亩硝土地，成了“取之不尽，用之不竭”的“聚宝盆”。全厂85％的原料，靠这块地供给。过去熬硝小组，只生产一种火硝，现在火硝本身由于综合利用，生产了炸药、硝酸、硫酸亚铁、芒硝等九种产品，而火硝的副产品卤水、小盐，又可以用来生产二十多种新产品，这些新产品，几乎每一种都比卤水、小盐价值大得多，用处也广泛得多。例如，过去被倒掉的卤水，制成工业盐酸，它的渣子又制成氧化镁，氧化镁的渣子又制成供化学分析用的氯化钾。化学原料中重要原料之一的纯碱、水玻璃和高级盐酸等十三种产品，就是从火硝的另一个副产品小盐中试制成功的。工厂党支部向全厂职工提出：要做到“没有废水，没有废气，没有废渣”，要硝土地的每一块土，都为社会主义建设服务。
    工厂既坚定不移的贯彻“就地取材，综合利用”的方针，同时又把综合利用和技术革新结合起来进行。工厂建厂初期，许多老年人不相信能综合利用，青年人怀疑这片硝土地能建立自己理想的高楼大厦。工厂支部没有采取一般的批评态度，首先组织了包括厂长、支部书记、积极分子、技术工人在内的技术革新小组，并派出一批职工到外地学习，接着建立了自己的小型试验室，购置了简单的化工书籍，要求大家苦学苦钻，先打开眼界，知道化学工业是什么东西。然后，提出响亮的口号：想出来，做出来，失败了，再重来。鼓励职工不怕困难，不怕失败，大胆创造。从火硝的副产品卤水中制成盐酸，是综合利用的第一炮。在建立盐酸炉时，失败过好几次，技术小组和广大职工一起座谈研究，分析失败的原因，并且用吸风水代替鼓风机，无烟煤饼代替烟煤，改造了炉型，调整了温度，终于试验成功了。第一次成功，鼓起了全厂职工的干劲，在很短时间内，就提出一千多条综合利用的合理化建议。当他们发觉新制成的盐酸渣子是一种又白又细的粉状时，就一手拿着书本，一手捧着渣子进行研究试验，结果制出氧化镁。氧化镁的渣子也不舍得倒掉，又作试验研究，制出了氯化钾。最后的渣子加上滑石粉，成了百货商店欢迎的鞋粉。卤水的综合利用，打破了职工们关于化学工业的“神秘”观念，使他们大胆的转向另一个火硝的副产品小盐的综合利用上，之后，又对主要产品火硝进行综合利用。这样，全厂就形成了火硝、卤水、小盐“三条龙”的综合利用的形势，而且三者越综合利用得充分，越有互相促进的作用，综合利用越有前途。最近他们用几种副产品试制成功硫酸，硫酸又是三者综合利用不能缺少的重要原料之一。
    现在，“就地取材，综合利用”成了真正的群众性的活动。许多职工口袋里整天装着化学工业书籍，对任何一件副产品都不放过，都要对照书本加以研究、试验。“向一切副产品要新产品”成了全体职工统一的口号。全厂计划今年还要向火硝、卤水、小盐、芒硝等要五十种以上的新产品，为了在更大规模、更好的条件下进行综合利用，一个机械化、半机械化技术革新运动正在这个厂展开。　（陈健）（附图片）
