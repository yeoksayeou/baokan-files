Gradually Realize Agricultural Modernization
Guo Zhenshan, First Secretary of the CPC Taigu County Committee

    Since 1958, the people of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, adhering to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with emphasis on indigenous methods," have fully mobilized the masses and launched a campaign to strive for the early realization of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. After two years of efforts, they have achieved tremendous results, and the county has seen a scene of crisscrossing power lines, networked canals, complete sets of irrigation and drainage equipment, and "dragon-like" tool systems.

    Wells in Clusters, Rivers and Canals in Networks

    Taigu County is located in the central Shanxi plain, with abundant water resources and crisscrossing rivers throughout the county. However, the full utilization of these water resources has only been realized since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Taigu County's water conservancy construction entered a new stage—based on the principle of giving equal importance to mountains, hills, and plains, combining drainage and storage, and combining reservoirs, wells, and canals—a mass movement for water conservancy was launched. After two spring and winter seasons of hard work by an army of 50,000 laborers, the county built 17 medium and small reservoirs, storing 22 million cubic meters of water; the utilized surface water increased from the original 60 million cubic meters to 110 million cubic meters; the number of water wells increased from more than 17,000 to 21,000, and the underground water increased from 30 million cubic meters to 90 million cubic meters; 6,300 new canals of various sizes were opened, stretching over 7,000 li. The county's irrigated area expanded from more than 460,000 mu to 750,000 mu, accounting for 83.3% of the county's cultivated land. Six of the county's eight major rivers have been controlled, water damage has been basically eliminated, and the past situation of spring drought and autumn flooding has been initially changed. After the completion of some reservoirs, not only has water conservancy been developed and water damage controlled, but also fisheries have been developed, rice has been planted, livestock have been raised, power stations have been built, community industries have been armed, and the income of commune members has increased.

    Mechanized Systems, Complete Tool Sets

    While vigorously developing water conservancy in 1958, Taigu County also began a mass movement to vigorously develop mechanization and semi-mechanization. Over the past two years, Taigu County has gradually formed a complete "Eight-Character Charter" mechanical network. At present, the county has 14 machinery factories and 207 repair stations, basically achieving the goal of having a machinery factory in every commune and a repair station in every district, and realizing the connection between the county, community, and three-level machinery industry and other industries, effectively promoting the speed of agricultural mechanization development. The county has created, imitated, and modified 7.45 million pieces of various mechanical tools, saving 15 million labor days. At present, a new situation has emerged in the county with ten "dragons" of tool innovation in irrigation and drainage, cultivation, plant protection, harvesting, transportation, grain processing, cooking utensils, pig raising, infrastructure construction, and special local product processing. Water conservancy irrigation and drainage is the first "dragon," with the Taigu-brand power well drilling machine as the leading product, and includes 17 kinds of tools such as mud pumps, downhole winches, and pneumatic water pumps, and 87% of the management areas have realized mechanized and semi-mechanized irrigation and drainage. Cultivation is the second "dragon," with tractors as the leading product, and includes 102 kinds of tools such as electric plows, deep plows, triangular harrows, clod crushers, seed selectors, germination testers, seedling raising devices, seeders, and corn directional planters. Plant protection machinery is the third "dragon," with automatic sprayers as the leading product, and includes nine kinds of tools such as corn heart injectors, bellows dusters, and long-range sprayers, with an average of one plant protection machine for every 14 to 40 mu. Harvesting machinery is the fourth "dragon," with the Taigu-brand harvester as the leading product, and includes combine harvesters, electric threshing machines, various threshers, and electric grass cutters, totaling 14 kinds of tools. Other machines for transportation, grain processing, cooking, pig raising, etc., have complete sets of improved tools or semi-mechanized tools. Comprehensively, the county's ten "dragon" mechanical projects include 398 kinds, totaling 960,000 pieces, and 85% of the management areas have initially reached the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    Electric Poles Standing Tall, Power Lines Crisscrossing

    At present, all eleven communes in Taigu County have electricity supply, of which ten communes are supplied with 10 kV high-voltage lines, and one commune in the mountainous area uses hydropower stations to generate electricity. 75% of the rural population in the county has access to electricity. 1,033 kilometers of high and low-voltage lines have been installed, with 1,336 electric motors, totaling 6,860 horsepower, which can irrigate 350,000 mu of land. At present, everywhere in the vast rural areas of Taigu County, one can see and hear electric poles standing tall, power lines crisscrossing, electric lights flashing, and motors rumbling. Wherever electricity goes, many manual operations are replaced by electricity. The county has universally realized electric well drilling, electric water pumping, electric high irrigation, electric grinding, electric grass cutting, electric threshing, electric planing, electric chopping, electric stations, electric milling, etc., increasing efficiency by several times to dozens of times. In the past, four people pushed a waterwheel to irrigate one and a half mu of land a day. Now, with an electric waterwheel, one laborer can irrigate 25 mu of land. The county's 1,047 electric waterwheels save 18 million labor days a year.

    The Great Power of "Three-izations"

    Due to the high-speed development of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification, the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has been powerfully guaranteed. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Taigu County increased by 35% compared with 1958. In 1959, despite spring drought and autumn flooding, grain output increased again compared with 1958. With the high-speed development of the "Three-izations," 70% of the county's 900,000 mu of cultivated land has reached the level of high-standard high-yield squares, high-yield ridges, and high-yield ditches. The high-speed development of the "Three-izations" has not only laid a solid foundation for the sustained leap forward of agriculture, but also brought about tremendous changes in people's mental outlook and ideological realm. Experience has proven that the more the "Three-izations" are developed, the more liberated people's minds are, and the higher the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is. Bai Daoguan, a technical innovation expert from Yangyi Commune in the province, has further liberated his mind since Yangyi Commune was supplied with electricity. In carrying out technical innovation, he has always considered making full use of electricity, so he has created electric grass cutters, pneumatic water pumps, and other universally significant innovations in the past year.

    *       *       *

    Over the past two years, the Party and people of Taigu County have achieved great results in the "Three-izations" movement, but it is still far from our lofty ideals. Therefore, we must continue to work hard, work hard for three years, vigorously carry out agricultural technical transformation, and further promote the popularization and improvement of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification, as well as advance towards the goal of agricultural modernization!

    逐步实现农业现代化
    中共太谷县委第一书记　郭振山
    山西太谷县人民从1958年开始，本着“土洋并举，以土为主”的方针，充分发动群众，展开了力争早日实现水利化、机械化、电气化的运动。经过两年来的努力，已经获得了巨大的成绩，县境内已经出现了电线纵横、渠道成网、排灌成套、工具成龙的景象。
    水井成群河渠成网
    太谷县地处晋中平川，水利资源充足、河流纵横全县。但是这些水利资源的充分利用，还是解放以后的事，特别是1958年大跃进以来，太谷县的水利建设进入了一个新的阶段——根据山丘平川并举，排蓄挖并举，库井渠并举的原则，以平川渠网化、垣地水利化、碱地良田化为目标——全民大搞水利化运动。经过五万劳动大军两个春冬的苦战，全县兴建中、小型水库十七座，蓄水二千二百万方；地面水由原利用起来的六千万方达到一亿一千万方；水井由一万七千多眼发展到二万一千眼，地下水由三千万方增加到九千万方；新开大小渠道六千三百条，长达七千余华里。全县水地面积由四十六万多亩扩大到七十五万亩，占全县耕地面积的83.3％。全县八条大河已经控制了六条，基本消灭了水害，初步改变了过去春旱秋涝的灾害局面。有些水库建成之后，不仅发展了水利，控制了水害，还发展了渔业，种上了水稻，饲养了六畜，建起了电站，武装了公社工业，增加了社员收入。
    机械成龙工具成套
    1958年大搞水利化的同时，太谷县就开始了大搞机械化半机械化的群众运动。两年来，太谷县逐步配套成龙，形成了“八字宪法”的机械网。目前全县已有十四个机械厂、二百零七个修配站，基本上作到了社社有机械厂，区区有修配站，并且实现了县社区三级机械工业和其它工业上下之间、互相之间的挂钩，有力地促进了农业机械化发展的速度，全县共创制、仿制、改制各种机械工具七百四十五万部，节约劳动工日一千五百万个。目前全县已经出现了排灌、耕作、植保、收获、运输、粮食加工、炊具、养猪、基建、土特产品加工工具革新十条龙的新局面。水利排灌为第一条龙，以太谷号动力打井机为龙头，有抽泥机、下洞卷扬机、气压抽水机等十七种工具，87％的管理区实现了排灌机械化半机械化。耕作为第二条龙，以拖拉机为龙头，有电力牵引犁、深耕犁、三角耙、打圪垃机、选种机、发芽试验器、育秧器、点播机、玉米定向播种机等一百零二种工具。植保机械为第三条龙，以自动喷雾器为龙头，有玉米灌心器、皮老虎喷粉器、远射喷雾器等九种工具，每十四亩至四十亩平均一部植保机器。收割机械为第四条龙，以太谷号收割机为龙头，有康拜因联合收割机、电动碾场机、各种脱粒机、电动切草机等共十四种工具。其他如运输、粮食加工、炊具、养猪机械等等，都有了成套的改良工具或半机械化工具，综合全县十条龙的机械项目有三百九十八种共九十六万件，85％的管理区已经初步达到了机械化、半机械化的水平。
    电杆林立电线纵横
    目前，太谷县十一个公社全部供电，其中十个公社是用十千伏高压线路送电，山区的一公社用水电站发电。全县75％的农村人口有了电。安装高低压线路一千零三十三公里，电动机一千三百三十六台、共六千八百六十马力，可灌溉土地三十五万亩。目前太谷县的广大农村到处看到和听到电杆林立，电线纵横，电光闪闪，马达隆隆。电力所到之处，许多手工操作的劳动被电力所代替了。全县普遍实现了电动打井、电动抽水、电动高灌、电动碾磨、电动切草、电动碾场、电刨、电铡、电站、电铣等，效率提高几倍到几十倍。过去四人推一辆水车，一天浇地一亩半，现在用电动水车一个劳力浇地二十五亩，全县一千零四十七部电动水车，一年节省劳力一千八百万个。
    “三化”威力强大
    由于水利化机械化电气化高速度的发展，有力地保证了工农业生产的持续跃进。1959年，太谷县工农业总产值比1958年增长了35％。1959年春旱秋涝，粮食产量比1958年又有增长。随着“三化”高速度的发展，全县九十万亩耕地中，有70％达到了高标准的丰产方、丰产梁、丰产沟的水平。“三化”高速度的发展，不仅为农业持续跃进奠定了坚实的基础，人们的精神面貌思想领域也发生了巨大的变化。经验已经证明，哪里的“三化”搞得越多，哪里人们的思想越解放，哪里的技术革新和技术革命运动也越高涨。全省技术革新能手阳邑公社的白道冠，自从阳邑公社送电之后，使他进一步的解放了思想，在进行技术革新中，处处考虑到充分利用电力，因此他一年来就创造了电动切草机、气压抽水机等有普遍意义的革新。
    *       *       *
    两年以来，太谷县的党和人民在“三化”运动中取得了很大成绩，但离我们的远大理想还很远。因此，我们必须继续努力，大干三年，大力进行农业技术改造，进一步为普及和提高水利化、机械化、电气化以及向农业现代化的目标前进！
