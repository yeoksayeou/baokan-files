Short Commentary:

　　From the current progressive situation of small blast furnaces, while the utilization coefficient is continuously improving and the coke ratio is continuously decreasing, we should immediately grasp the main link of pig iron quality. At present, the output of pig iron from small blast furnaces accounts for more than 50% of the total pig iron output. Good pig iron quality is useful in steelmaking, which can shorten steelmaking time, improve equipment utilization coefficient, reduce pig iron consumption, extend furnace life, increase melting rate of iron melting furnaces, and improve steel quality. Used in machinery manufacturing, it can improve the quality of mechanical products and extend their service life. Poor pig iron quality will adversely affect steelmaking and machinery manufacturing. Therefore, the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces is already a major issue that directly affects the entire industrial construction undertaking and the completion of this year's national plan in a faster, better, and more economical way.

　　The objective conditions for improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces this year are generally better than last year. First, most small blast furnaces have undergone varying degrees of technical transformation, the capacity of hot blast stoves has increased, and the hot blast temperature has improved. Second, we have created and systematically summarized the experience of fighting against sulfur. The current key is to establish a quality concept, firmly grasp the supply of raw materials, ensure sufficient reserves, and carry out raw material processing well to lay a good foundation for improving pig iron quality.

　　Experience over the past year has proven that the basic measures for improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces are: enterprise leaders must ideologically clarify the impact of the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces on steelmaking and machinery manufacturing, so that grassroots leaders attach importance to quality ideologically. Fully mobilize the masses, widely launch discussions on improving pig iron quality among all employees, and establish the concept that ironmaking must serve steelmaking and casting. And rely on all employees to contribute ideas and set up defenses everywhere to encircle and suppress the key issues of improving pig iron quality. Work must be done conscientiously to do a good job in coal washing and improve coke quality. Continue to implement advanced experiences such as ore roasting, using quicklime instead of limestone, and sintering powdery ore. Strengthen quality management work, establish a strict testing and inspection system for raw materials, slag, and finished products, conscientiously implement the grading and stacking of pig iron according to composition, and establish regular contact with the user department, always check the test results, and take timely improvement measures.

　　Improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces is an important issue in the current increase in steel production and machinery manufacturing, and it must be resolved in the shortest possible time by all means. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, with a clear understanding of ideas, relying on the broad masses, and taking resolute measures, the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces will definitely be rapidly improved, and the comprehensive leap forward task of small blast furnaces will definitely be successfully completed.

　　把小高炉生铁质量放在首要地位
    从当前小高炉的进步的形势来看，在利用系数不断提高和焦比不断降低的情况下，应该立刻抓住生铁质量这个主要环节。目前小高炉生铁的产量已占全部生铁产量的50％以上。生铁质量好用，在炼钢上，可以缩短炼钢时间，提高设备的利用系数，降低生铁消耗，延长炉体寿命，化铁炉熔化率也会提高，而且可以提高钢的质量。用于机械制造，可以使机械产品质量提高，延长使用寿命。生铁质量不好，炼钢和机械制造将受到不利的影响。所以小高炉生铁质量问题，已经是当前直接关系着整个工业建设事业与多快好省地完成今年国家计划的重大问题之一。
    提高小高炉生铁质量，今年的客观条件一般比去年好。第一，大部分小高炉经过了不同程度的技术改造，热风炉能力加大，热风温度提高了。第二，我们已经创造并且比较系统地总结了与硫磺作斗争的经验。当前的关键在于树立质量观念，狠抓原料供应，作到储备充足，很好地进行原料加工处理，为改进生铁质量打下良好的基础。
    一年来的经验证明，改进小高炉生铁质量的基本措施是：企业领导要在思想上明确小高炉生铁质量对炼钢与机械制造的影响，使基层领导人员从思想上重视质量。充分发动群众，在全体职工中广泛展开改进生铁质量的讨论，树立炼铁必须为炼钢和铸造服务的观念。并且依靠全体职工人人献计，处处设防，围攻提高生铁质量的关键问题，要认真地把洗煤工作做好，改进焦炭质量，要继续贯彻执行矿石焙烧、生石灰代石灰石、粉矿烧结等先进经验。要加强质量管理工作，建立严格的原料、炉渣和成品的化验和检验制度，认真贯彻执行生铁按成份分级堆放，并与使用部门建立经常联系，随时核对化验结果，及时采取改进措施。
    提高小高炉生铁质量是当前钢铁增产和机械制造的一个重要问题，必须千方百计地在最短期间内解决。我们相信，在党的领导下，明确思想认识，依靠广大群众，采取坚决措施，小高炉生铁质量一定能够迅速提高，小高炉的全面跃进任务一定能够胜利完成。
