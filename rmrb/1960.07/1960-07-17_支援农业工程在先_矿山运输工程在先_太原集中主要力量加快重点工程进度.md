Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 16th: Taiyuan City recently adjusted its capital construction projects, adopting a large-scale operational approach to accelerate the progress of key construction projects.

This year's capital construction tasks in Taiyuan City are greater than in any previous year, with investment increasing by 17% compared to 1958 and over a thousand construction projects underway. To complete these projects on time, with quality and quantity assured, relevant departments conducted a construction schedule at the beginning of the year, resulting in rapid progress. The completed and transferred area in the first six months reached 3.1 million square meters, an increase of 6.1% compared to the same period last year. However, due to insufficient understanding of the principle of "concentrating forces and ensuring key projects" by some grassroots leaders, the investigation and scheduling of projects were not thorough or detailed enough, and the organization of manpower and the use of raw materials were not concentrated enough, resulting in relatively slow progress in some key construction projects, failing to meet the scheduled completion dates. The Taiyuan City Basic Construction Committee, following the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Taiyuan City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, criticized the one-sided views of some grassroots leaders who did not consider the overall situation and did not pay attention to the completion of projects. Based on a comprehensive assessment, they recently re-verified and arranged projects based on the principles of "overall situation first, key projects first." They prioritized capital construction projects supporting agriculture and raw material production, and added some agricultural machinery factory and fertilizer plant construction projects. In terms of raw material industrial construction, they decided to carry out comprehensive technical upgrades on eight small and medium-sized mines to expand production capacity, and to build dedicated railway lines in the mining areas to solve the weak link of transportation. At the same time, they appropriately compressed and postponed some construction projects where construction conditions were not available or were not urgently needed.

To ensure the completion of key construction projects with quality, quantity, and on schedule, the city recently established a unified operational headquarters to centrally mobilize the city's existing construction manpower and materials. The projects were divided into operational units based on key projects, and large-scale operations were carried out. In terms of construction methods, a strategy of compressing the front line, carrying out focused attacks in batches, and fighting annihilation battles was adopted, ensuring that a batch was started, a batch was prepared, a batch was completed, and then another batch was built.

Since the beginning of July, construction companies across the city have organized large groups, concentrating their main forces on attacking finishing projects, increasing the number of projects scheduled for completion in the third quarter from the original sixty-two to one hundred and sixteen. In organizing large-scale operations, leaders at all levels have gone deep into the front lines of the projects, worked alongside the teams, and promptly resolved new problems in manpower organization and raw material supply, accelerating the progress of key projects and finishing projects. Leaders of the Municipal Construction Committee and various construction companies have also organized working groups and promotion teams to go to key projects to work alongside the teams, direct operations, identify problems, and resolve them promptly.

### 支援农业工程在先　矿山运输工程在先　太原集中主要力量加快重点工程进度

　　太原集中主要力量加快重点工程进度
    新华社太原16日电　太原市最近调整了基本建设项目，采用大兵团作战的办法加快重点建设工程进度。
    太原市今年的基本建设任务比已往任何一年都大，投资额比1958年增长17％，施工项目达一千多个。为了按质按量按期完成这些工程，有关部门今年一开始就作了施工排队，因而工程进度很快，头六个月移交竣工面积三百一十万平方米，比去年同期增长了6.1％。但是，由于部分基层领导干部对“集中力量，保证重点”的方针认识不足，对于工程项目的摸底和排队工作做得不够深入、细致，人力组织和原材料使用不够集中，因而某些重点施工项目进度比较迟缓，没能按期竣工。太原市基本建设委员会遵照中共山西省委和中共太原市委的指示，批判了某些基层领导干部不照顾全局和不重视工程结尾的片面观点，并且在全面摸底的基础上本着全局第一，重点第一的原则，在最近对工程项目重新进行了核对和安排。他们首先把支援农业和原材料生产的基本建设项目，提到了首要地位，并且增加了一些农业机械厂和化肥厂建设项目。在原材料工业建设方面，确定对八个中小型矿山进行全面技术改造，扩大生产能力，并且要在矿区增修铁路专用线，以解决矿区运输的薄弱环节。与此同时，他们还适当压缩推迟了一些施工条件不具备和不急需的建设工程。
    为了使重点建设工程保质保量和按期完工，最近全市又建立了统一的作战指挥部，统一调动全市现有的施工人力和物力，并且按重点工程分成作战单位，开展大兵团作战。在施工方法上，采取压缩战线，分批突击，打歼灭战的办法，做到开工一批，准备一批，建成一批，再建一批。
    进入7月份以来，全市各建筑公司组织了大兵团，集中了主要兵力突击结尾工程，使准备在第三季度竣工的项目由原来的六十二项增加到一百一十六项。在组织大兵团作战中，各级领导干部深入工程第一线，跟班劳动，及时解决人力组织和原材料供应中的新问题，加快了重点工程和结尾工程进度。市建委和各建筑公司的领导干部，也组织了工作组、促进团，分赴各重点工程跟班劳动，指挥作战，发现问题，及时解决。
