Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 14th: The General Declaration passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council is as follows:

We are currently at one of the great moments of liberation in history – indeed, it is the first time that the pressure of the people is acting powerfully and simultaneously in all parts of the world.

The people of all countries are advancing. They have achieved remarkable victories, from Japan and Korea in the East to Cuba in the West. No continent and hardly any country has not been moved. In Africa, new independent countries are being born one after another, breaking away from imperialism and colonialism.

At the same time, there are other disturbing signs. Whether it is the people of South Korea, the people of Japan, or the people of Turkey, they have not been able to break free from the shackles of military bases. In Southeast Asia, especially in South Vietnam, Laos, and West Irian, a disturbing situation is developing. Economic sanctions have been imposed on Cuba, and there are threats to take even more severe measures. Belgium has sent troops to the Congo in an attempt to undo the Congo's recently gained independence. The French government's die-hard attitude has caused the preliminary talks with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to fail. Equipping the Federal Republic of Germany with nuclear weapons and missiles greatly increases the danger of war. Finally, the Geneva Disarmament Conference, on which hopes for disarmament were pinned, had to break down.

As a result of these experiences, the people of the world are increasingly aware of who the enemies of peace are. To defeat their attempts, the world peace movement must intensify its struggle more vigorously than ever before. To carry out this struggle, all peace forces throughout the world must maintain and develop the closest unity and cooperation.

For many years since the beginning of our movement, millions of people in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, together with the people of socialist countries and newly independent countries, have been fighting for peace. These forces have grown enormously and rapidly, and their activities have strengthened. This is an arduous struggle. Peace workers have been persecuted in many countries, sometimes even tortured to death.

The recent events in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan should serve as an example for all of us. This is particularly encouraging because we see that the youth are at the forefront of the movement there, and we can see the same signs in Britain, France, Italy, and many other places. People and youth everywhere have taken a stand for peace. The heroic struggle of the great African peoples for independence has won the admiration of the world.

Through the combined struggle of all these forces against war and colonialism, the road to peace is finally opened. Comprehensive disarmament and peaceful coexistence cannot be achieved until the people's right to independence and full respect for their sovereignty in political and economic terms are fully guaranteed.

Therefore, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council calls on the people everywhere to work towards the following current goals:

	(1) Hold a broad disarmament conference with the participation of all countries.

	(2) Ban the testing of all nuclear weapons.

	(3) Prohibit all aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from flying; strictly abide by international law regarding the prohibition of aircraft from flying without authorization in foreign airspace.

	(4) Remove all military bases in foreign countries.

	(5) Abolish all military treaties.

	(6) Immediately formulate plans for the transition from a war economy to a peaceful economy.

	(7) Stop all acts of political, military, and economic aggression that violate the national sovereignty of countries and threaten peace; supporting all struggles for national independence, defending national sovereignty, and opposing racism is a long-term task of the world peace movement.

We demand the release of all imprisoned peace workers, the restoration of full rights to all those who have been persecuted, and the guarantee of freedom to work for peace in all countries.

Concrete actions must be taken to raise the awareness of the people, to put pressure on their governments to reach genuine agreements on disarmament and peaceful coexistence quickly.

Truth and justice are on our side. The direction we are moving in is the mainstream of human progress. We firmly believe that our struggle will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 14th: The Letter to the Peoples of All Countries passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council is as follows: Today, the people of the world live under the ever-present threat of nuclear war; they cannot accept the failure of international negotiations.

Disarmament is indispensable for saving humanity and ensuring peaceful coexistence.

The people of all countries must demand disarmament. They have the power to achieve this demand. The recent victories of mass action prove this.

We demand a world conference in which all countries – whether members of the United Nations or not – can participate, to achieve phased, universal, and supervised disarmament. We believe that, in order to avoid the most urgent danger, the first phase must include the prohibition of the means of launching nuclear weapons and the closure of foreign military bases.

We demand that all governments declare their willingness to participate in such a conference and their determination to make the conference produce concrete results.

We demand that all governments begin now to create favorable conditions for holding this conference. To this end, they must avoid taking any action that would exacerbate the Cold War, abandon nuclear tests, and respect the sovereignty and independence of other countries.

We call on everyone to support this demand.

			Standing Committee of the World Peace Council
				July 11, 1960, Stockholm

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 14th: The resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on launching a massive world movement for disarmament and consolidating peace is as follows:

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has analyzed the international situation – which is characterized by the massive movement of people from all countries against the danger of new wars, against colonialism, and for peace and national independence – and, after passing a resolution defining its current goals, has decided to launch a massive world movement for disarmament and consolidating peace, so that the people of all countries can clearly express their support for these goals.

The Standing Committee recommends to all (peace) movements in all countries:

	Make the resolutions of this meeting known to all levels of the people and implement them;

	Firmly and proactively struggle to strengthen the people's struggle against the danger of new wars;

	Call on the people of all countries to raise their vigilance and organize struggles against all actions that endanger peace, against all attacks on the sovereignty and national independence of the people of all countries;

	Express the broadest international solidarity with the people of all countries who are struggling for independence and peace;

	Organize world public opinion to massively demand disarmament and peace.

In order to enable these diverse actions and activities to develop into a global movement for disarmament and strengthening peace, the Standing Committee, taking into account the specific circumstances and special purposes of each country or region, makes the following recommendations to the National Peace Committees:

	Take all forms of action: rallies, conferences, marches, relay races, delegations, petitions, collecting signatures for the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the peoples of the world issued in Stockholm;

	Organize days of action, weeks of action, and months of action, so that world public opinion can massively express demands for disarmament and peace, so as to put pressure on governments that pursue policies that run counter to maintaining peace, and support the proposals and initiatives of governments that work for peace;

	Send delegations and deliver memorandums to members of parliament and elected assemblies, asking them to express their views on these goals;

	Cooperate with all peace forces, and work together with all opinions and all organizations that also hope to work for disarmament;

	Send thousands of petitions, letters, and telegrams to the United Nations, especially during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly that will study the issue of disarmament, so that it understands that the people of all countries firmly hope that the negotiations will be successful;

	Utilize all forms of publicity that can inform the people and participate in the struggle, organize various exhibitions, publish simple and popular leaflets and pamphlets, produce and screen short films so that the harm of the arms race and the benefits that the people can obtain from disarmament and peace can be explained easily and concretely; this should be done with the cooperation of scientists, writers, and artists;

The Standing Committee will support, and recommends that all national (peace) movements support, or jointly organize with other forces, international, regional, national, and group initiatives, the purpose of these actions is to fight against the danger of new wars, and strive for easing tensions, disarmament, peaceful coexistence, and the independence and sovereignty of the people of all countries.

The World Peace Council will participate in the Sixth World Congress in Tokyo, and will work for the success of the Congress. It asks the National Committees to do the same, to send representatives, to send letters and telegrams expressing support and solidarity, and to take August 6, the day Hiroshima was bombed, as a great world day of struggle, which will promote the general movement against military treaties and bases, for the cessation of nuclear tests, and for universal, supervised disarmament.

The Standing Committee recommends that the Presidium and Secretariat of the World Peace Council disseminate the experience of the activities of the National (Peace) Movements, in order to help broadly exchange experiences and establish links between the national movements, and to establish links with all groups or movements that strive for peace.

The Standing Committee recommends that the National Committees make extremely thorough preparations for the World Peace Council meeting, which will be held before the end of 1960, preferably in an Asian country. This meeting will be a new and important stage in the world movement for disarmament, against military bases and nuclear tests, for peace, national independence, and peaceful coexistence between the people of all countries.

    世界和平理事会常委会通过总宣言和告各国人民书
　　坚决加强人民斗争保卫世界和平
    新华社14日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会常务委员会通过的总宣言如下：
    目前我们正处在历史上伟大的解放时刻之一——的确，这是人民的压力第一次在世界各地同时起有力作用的时刻。
    各国人民正在前进。他们已经取得了显著的胜利，从东方的日本和朝鲜到西方的古巴。没有一个洲而且几乎没有一个国家没有动起来。在非洲，新的独立国家正在一个个诞生，摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义。
    同时，另外有一些令人不安的迹象。不论是南朝鲜人民、日本人民或是土耳其人民，到现在为止，都没有能够挣脱军事基地的桎梏。在东南亚，特别是在南越、老挝和西伊里安，正在形成一种令人不安的局势。对古巴实行了经济制裁，并且威胁着要采取更严厉的措施。比利时已派军队到刚果，企图取消刚果最近获得的独立。法国政府的死硬态度使得同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府举行的初步谈判遭到失败。以核武器和导弹装备德意志联邦共和国的做法大大增加了战争危险。最后，裁军希望所寄的日内瓦裁军会议不得不破裂。
    由于这些经验，世界人民越来越懂得谁是和平的敌人。为了击败他们的企图，世界和平运动必须比以往更加有力地加紧进行斗争。为了进行这个斗争，全世界所有的和平力量必须保持和发展最密切的团结和合作。
    自从我们的运动开始到现在许多年来，亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美洲各地的千百万人同社会主义国家和新独立的国家各国人民一道，一直在为争取和平而斗争。这些力量有巨大和迅速的增长，他们的活动已经加强。这是一场艰巨的斗争。和平工作者在许多国家遭到迫害，有时候甚至被折磨致死。
    最近在南朝鲜、土耳其和日本发生的事件应当成为我们大家的榜样。这是特别有希望的，因为我们在那里看到，青年走在运动的最前列，我们在英国、法国和意大利以及其他许多地方也可以看到同样的迹象。到处的人民和青年都采取了争取和平的立场。伟大的非洲各国人民争取独立的英勇斗争赢得了全世界的敬佩。
    通过这一切力量反对战争和殖民主义的联合斗争，通向和平的道路终于打开了。只要人民的独立权以及对他们在政治方面以及在经济方面的主权的完全尊重没有得到充分的保证，就不能获得全面的裁军及和平共处。
    因此，世界和平理事会常务委员会呼吁各地的人民为下列这些当前的目标而努力：
      （一）举行有各国参加的广泛的裁军会议。
    （二）禁止试验一切核武器。
    （三）禁止一切携带核武器的飞机飞行；严格遵守国际法关于飞机不得擅自在外国领空飞行的规定。
      （四）撤除一切在外国的军事基地。
    （五）废除一切军事条约。
    （六）立即制订关于使战争经济过渡到和平经济的计划。
      （七）制止一切侵犯各国国家主权和威胁和平的政治、军事和经济的侵略行动；支持一切争取民族独立、保卫国家主权和反对种族主义的斗争是世界和平运动的长期任务。
    我们要求释放一切被监禁的和平工作者，恢复所有那些受到迫害的人的充分权利，保障在各国为和平而工作的自由。
    必须采取具体行动来提高人民的觉悟，使他们对本国政府施加压力，要它迅速达成关于裁军和和平共处的真正协议。
    真理和正义在我们这一边。我们前进的方向是人类进步的主流。我们坚信，我们的斗争将克服一切困难和障碍，而取得最后胜利。

                          1960年7月9日—11日于斯德哥尔摩
    新华社14日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会常务委员会通过的告各国人民书如下：今天，全世界人民生活在一直存在的核战争威胁中；他们不能接受国际谈判的失败。
    裁军是拯救人类和保证和平共处所不可或缺的。
    各国人民必须要求裁军。他们有力量实现这一要求。群众行动最近取得的胜利证明了这一点。
    我们要求举行一次所有的国家——联合国成员或非联合国成员都一样——都可以参加的世界会议，以实现分阶段进行的普遍的和有监督的裁军。我们认为，为了避免最迫切的危险，第一阶段必须包括禁止发射核武器的工具和封闭外国军事基地。
    我们要求所有的政府宣布它们愿意参加这样一个会议和它们决心使会议产生具体的成果。
    我们要求所有的政府现在就开始为举行这个会议创造有利的条件。为了这一目的，它们必须避免采取会加剧冷战的任何行动，放弃核试验和尊重其他国家的主权和独立。
    我们号召每一个人都支持这一要求。

                              1960年7月11日于斯德哥尔摩
    新华社14日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会常务委员会通过关于展开争取裁军和巩固和平的巨大世界运动的决议，全文如下：
    世界和平理事会常务委员会分析了国际局势——它的特点是各国人民展开了反对新战争危险，反对殖民主义，争取和平和民族独立的巨大运动——并且在通过了确定它的目前目标的决议以后，决定展开一个争取裁军和巩固和平的巨大的世界运动，以便使各国人民能够清楚地表示他们支持这些目的。
    常务委员会向所有各国的（和平）运动建议：
    使各阶层人民都知道这次会议的决议，并且付之实施；
    坚决地主动地进行奋斗以便加强人民反对新战争危险的斗争；
    号召各国人民提高警惕和组织斗争来反对危及和平的一切行动，反对对各国人民的主权和民族独立的一切进攻；
    对为争取独立和和平而斗争的各国人民表示最广泛的国际声援；
    组织全世界舆论，大规模地要求裁军和和平。
    为了使这些多方面的行动和活动能够发展成为争取裁军和加强和平的世界性运动，常务委员会考虑到各国或各地区的具体情况和特殊目的，向各国和平委员会作如下建议：
    采取一切行动方式：集会，大会，游行，接力赛跑，代表团，请愿，为世界和平理事会常务委员会在斯德哥尔摩发表的告世界人民的呼吁书征集签名；
    组织行动日，行动周和行动月，以便使全世界舆论大规模地表示要求裁军和和平，以便能够对奉行同维护和平背道而驰的政策的各国政府施加压力，并支持为和平而努力的政府的建议和倡议；
    向议会议员和当选的议会派遣代表团和递送备忘录，要求他们表示对这些目的的看法；
    同一切和平力量合作，同也希望为裁军而努力的一切舆论和一切组织共同努力；
    向联合国组织，特别是在将研究裁军问题的下届联合国大会期间，送交数以千计的请愿书，信件和电报等，使它了解，各国人民坚决希望谈判能得到成功；
  利用一切能够使人民了解情况和参加斗争的宣传形式，组织各种展览会，出版简单通俗的传单和小册子，摄制和放映短片以便能浅易具体地说明军备竞赛的祸害和人民可以从裁军和和平中得到的好处，这样做的时候需要科学家，文学家和艺术家的合作；
    常务委员会将支持，并建议各国（和平）运动支持，或同其它力量共同组织国际性的、区域性的、国家的和集团的主动行动，这些行动的目的是同新战争危险进行斗争，努力争取缓和紧张局势，裁军，和平共处和各国人民的独立和主权。
    世界和平理事会将参加在东京举行的第六届世界大会，并且将为大会的成功而努力。它要求各国委员会也这样做，派遣代表，发出表示支持和声援的函电，把8月6日广岛被炸的日子，作为伟大的世界斗争日，这将促进反对军事条约和基地，争取停止核试验和普遍的、有监督的裁军的总的运动。
    常务委员会建议世界和平理事会主席团和书记处传播各国（和平）运动的活动经验，以便有助于广泛地交流经验和建立各国运动之间的联系，和同一切争取和平的团体或者运动建立联系。
    常务委员会建议各国委员会为将在1960年年底以前最好将在亚洲国家举行的世界和平理事会会议进行极其周密的准备，这次会议将是争取裁军，反对军事基地和核试验，争取和平、民族独立和各国人民之间的和平共处的世界运动中的新的和重要的阶段。
