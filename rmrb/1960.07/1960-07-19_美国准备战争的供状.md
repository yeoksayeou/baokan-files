　　America's Confession of War Preparations
    The American magazine "Time" published a map on July 4th showing the locations of major U.S. global military bases with China and the Soviet Union as targets. This map clearly demonstrates that the United States is accelerating the development of missiles and expanding military bases for the purpose of launching a war against socialist countries such as China and the Soviet Union. It is evident that U.S. imperialism will never abandon its aggressive ambitions simply because the socialist camp is strong. The map legend divides U.S. military bases into six categories: ① Army operational bases ② Army logistics bases ③ Naval bases ④ Naval air bases ⑤ Air Force bases ⑥ Bases established under treaties. Aircraft taking off from these bases and missiles launched from them are all aimed at the Soviet Union and China.

    The upper part of the map features the United States and Canada. The United States has thirty-five strategic air bases, including eighteen planned intercontinental missile bases. Moving clockwise, first is Vandenberg Air Force Base in the United States, from which "Atlas" intercontinental missiles with a range of 7,500 miles can be launched, reaching deep into the heartland of China and the Soviet Union. In Alaska, the United States has bases of types ①, ③, and ⑤. In the Aleutian Islands, there are bases of types ③ and ⑤. American submarines operating in the Sea of Okhotsk can launch "Polaris" missiles. At Pearl Harbor, the United States has bases of types ①, ③, ④, and ⑤. The United States has a type ④ base on Midway Island. The large number of bases established by the United States in South Korea, Japan, Okinawa, Guam, and the Philippines are all aimed at aggression against China. The United States also has the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific.

    The lower part of the map features West Pakistan, where the United States has established aggressive bases under the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." In Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the United States has an air force base. Moving upwards, the Mediterranean Sea features the U.S. Sixth Fleet, and Turkey has bases established by the United States under the "North Atlantic Treaty." The United States has bases in Libya, Italy, Morocco, Spain, France, and West Germany. The United States is plotting to supply North Atlantic aggressive group countries with "Polaris" missiles launched from submarines or trains. The map shows that the United States has a large number of air force bases in the United Kingdom, from which aircraft can attack the Soviet heartland with "Lightning" air-to-ground missiles with a range of 1,000 miles. In Norway and Iceland, the United States has bases established under the "North Atlantic Treaty," and the United States has established an air force base in Thule, Greenland. The United States has bases of types ④ and ⑤ in Newfoundland.

　　美国准备战争的供状
    美国“时代”周刊七月四日刊登了一幅以中苏为进攻目标的美国主要环球军事基地位置图。这幅地图清楚地表明了美国加紧发展导弹和扩展军事基地是为了准备对中苏等社会主义国家发动战争的目的。可见，美帝国主义绝不会因为社会主义阵营力量强大而放弃它的侵略野心。图例把美国军事基地分为六类：①陆军作战基地②陆军后勤基地③海军基地④海军航空基地⑤空军基地⑥根据条约设立的基地。从这些基地起飞的飞机和发射的导弹，都是针对着苏联和中国的。
    地图正面上端为美国及加拿大。在美国设有三十五个战略空军基地，其中包括计划建造中的十八个洲际导弹基地。循顺时针往下，首先是美国范登堡空军基地，从这里发射的“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹，射程七千五百哩，可以深入中苏腹地。在阿拉斯加，美国设有第①，③，⑤各类基地。在阿留申群岛有第③，⑤两类基地。在鄂霍次克海活动的美国潜艇可以发射“北极星”导弹。在珍珠港美国设有第①，③，④，⑤各类基地。中途岛有美国的第④类基地。美国在南朝鲜、日本、冲绳、关岛、菲律宾设立的大批基地都是以侵略中国为目的的。美国在太平洋还有第七舰队。
    地图正面下端，西巴基斯坦有美国根据“东南亚集体防务条约”所建立的侵略基地。在沙特阿拉伯的达兰有美国的空军基地。循此而上，在地中海有美国的第六舰队，在土耳其有美国根据“北大西洋公约”设立的基地。在利比亚、意大利、摩洛哥、西班牙、法国、西德都设有美国的基地。美国正在阴谋以从潜艇或列车发射的“北极星”导弹供应北大西洋侵略集团国家。地图显示美国在英国设有大批空军基地，从这些基地起飞的飞机，可以用射程为一千哩的空对地“闪电”导弹袭击苏联腹地。在挪威、冰岛，美国有根据“北大西洋公约”设立的基地，在格陵兰的图列美国设立了空军基地。美国在纽芬兰设有第④，⑤两类基地。
