Mathematical Research Connects with Production Practice to Directly Serve Production
Shandong Widely Applies Operations Research to Tap Production Potential
(Our dispatch) Reporter Wang Jianlin reports: Can mathematical research be widely connected with production practice, directly serve production, and drive the development of mathematical theory itself in the process of serving production? After nearly a year of effort, mathematicians in Shandong Province have opened up a broad path in this regard and achieved great results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is currently holding an on-site meeting in Shandong with more than 370 representatives from all over the country.

Since the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened the Leap Forward Conference of Science and Technology Workers in October last year, more than 3,000 teachers and students from more than 30 universities and colleges in Shandong Province, more than 100,800 teachers and students from various secondary schools, and some primary school teachers, under the direct leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, implemented large-scale collaboration, large-scale battles, and large-scale mass movements to carry out large-scale research and promotion and application of modern mathematical operations research. Mathematicians were distributed to most transportation and materials allocation departments in various cities, prefectures, and counties throughout the province, as well as some factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, state-owned farms, and water conservancy construction sites. They went deep into all aspects of production, worked as assistant automobile drivers, and served as receiving and shipping clerks. They humbly learned from workers and technicians, and conducted extensive investigations and research. As a result, they discovered a large number of mathematical problems in industrial and agricultural production and the national economy, and solved them using operations research and other mathematical methods.

This mathematical team, in its mathematical research, resolutely relied on Party committees at all levels, handed mathematics over to the masses, and enabled mathematics to be mastered by more people. They adopted various effective methods to impart to the broad masses of workers and peasants the knowledge of linear programming, a branch of operations research. Up to now, more than 1,000 linear programming training classes and on-site meetings have been held in various parts of the province, and more than 300,000 workers, peasants, technicians, and factory and mine enterprise managers have learned to use linear programming. In addition, more than 8 million people have received publicity and education on linear programming. Seventy-nine counties and cities, 713 people's communes, and 118 factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the province have promoted and applied linear programming, forming a mass movement of studying and using linear programming on a large scale. Once the workers and peasants master modern mathematical knowledge, they immediately demonstrate extraordinary talents and put forward many new topics that mathematicians had not anticipated. The "trapezoidal departure method" and the "differential multiplication dispatch theorem" in transportation were first proposed by workers and then successfully researched by teachers and students. Ninety-two workers and enterprise managers in Jinan City have been hired as part-time researchers at the Mathematics Research Institute of the Provincial Academy of Sciences.

At present, linear programming and certain other branches of operations research have been widely applied to industrial and agricultural production and many sectors of the national economy, serving production and serving life. Using the "graphical method" and "tabular method" in linear programming for vehicle scheduling can generally increase mileage utilization by 10% in cities and 15%-20% in special zones and counties; using it to rationally allocate materials can save about 10% of transportation capacity. The Jinan Railway Administration used linear programming to rationally arrange freight transportation, saving 18.236 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity from January to April; the transportation capacity saved by Jinan City in nearly five months is equivalent to the carrying capacity of 904 automobiles for one month. According to relevant calculations, the transportation capacity saved by the above two items alone is equivalent to a train with 50 cars (each with a load of 40 tons) traveling back and forth 113 times on the 497-kilometer route from Jinan to Beijing. Experience has proven that using linear programming methods to formulate rational material allocation plans, rationally solve the connection between long-distance and short-distance transportation, rationally organize sources of goods, arrange freight transportation, and rationally dispatch vehicles can improve mileage utilization rates, whether for modern means of transportation or folk transportation tools.

Linear programming has also been successfully applied in industry and agriculture. In the past, one person at Qingdao State Cotton Mill No. 1 watched 48 machines and had to travel 60 to 70 li every day. After using linear programming to adjust, each person walked 7 li less and could watch 4 to 5 more machines. Linear programming is used in people's communes for rational allocation of labor, rational layout of crops, rational utilization of land, rational planning of water channels, and rational transportation of fertilizers, with significant results. At present, the application scope of linear programming has expanded to many fields such as basic construction, mail delivery, wire erection, livestock farms, processing plants, tractor stations, and residential area layout, as well as sewing, kiln, and brewing industries, and has saved manpower, materials, and financial resources to varying degrees.

Mathematicians have discovered in production practice that various mathematical problems urgently need to be solved. Currently, they are not simply limited to the research and application of linear programming, but are exploring nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, and other branches of operations research such as queuing theory, game theory, and network theory.

In the research of mathematics widely connecting with production practice, mathematicians have also gained a lot in theoretical exploration. They have created and improved some new mathematical calculation methods from rich practice, introduced some new concepts in theory, obtained some new theorems and corollaries, and written more than 50 valuable papers, and compiled nine books such as "Lectures on Mathematical Programming" and "Mathematical Statistics and Quality Control," accumulating about 1.2 million words of data. The "maximum and minimum problem of multiple functions" explored by Qufu Normal College creatively applies linear programming methods to solve nonlinear programming problems and has considerable theoretical value.

The methods adopted by Shandong mathematicians in mathematical research have also promoted the development of mathematical departments and improved the quality of teaching, and have cultivated and expanded the ranks of mathematics teachers. This has triggered a teaching revolution in the field of mathematics. Shandong University, Shandong Normal College, and other institutions have taken operations research, probability theory, differential equations, and computational mathematics as important courses according to the needs of production and construction. Shandong University has also opened a specialization in mathematical programming and established teaching and research groups for computational mathematics and probability theory. Other institutions have also made corresponding developments in this regard. Before 1958, Shandong was a blank in operations research, but now many people are competent in this completely new course. Through this period of production practice, teachers and students of mathematics departments in various colleges and universities generally felt that they could no longer teach and learn in the old way. They used a large number of facts to expose the slow, poor, and costly phenomenon in mathematics teaching and formulated new teaching reform plans, making many adjustments in the curriculum system and content.

    数学研究联系生产实际直接为生产服务
    山东广泛应用运筹学挖掘生产潜力
    本报讯　记者王建林报道：数学研究能否广泛联系生产实际，直接为生产服务，并在为生产服务中，带动数学理论自身的发展？山东省的数学工作者们，经过将近一年的努力，在这方面已经开辟出一条广阔的道路，取得了巨大成绩。中国科学院现正在山东召开有全国各地三百七十多名代表参加的现场会议。
    自去年10月中共山东省委召开科学技术工作者跃进大会以来，山东省三十多所高等学校的师生、科学工作者三千多人和各中等学校的师生、部分小学教师十万零八千多人，在中共山东省委的直接领导下，实行大协作，大会战，大搞群众运动，对现代数学运筹学展开了大规模的研究与推广应用工作。数学工作者们分布到全省各市、专、县的大部分交通运输、物资调拨部门，以及部分厂矿企业、人民公社、国营农场和水利工地。他们深入生产中的各个坏节，当汽车司机助手，担任收货员、发货员，虚心向工人、技术人员请教，广泛进行调查研究，结果，挖掘出大量工农业生产和国民经济中的数学问题，并且运用运筹学和其它数学方法解决。
    这支数学队伍，在数学研究中，坚决依靠各级党委，将数学交给群众，让数学能为更多的人所掌握。他们采取多种有效方法，向广大工农群众贯输运筹学中一个分支线性规划的知识。到目前为止，全省各地共举办线性规划训练班和召开现场会等一千多次，有三十多万名工人、农民、技术人员和厂矿企业管理人员学会运用线性规划，另有八百多万人受到了线性规划的宣传教育。全省已有七十九个县、市，七百一十三个人民公社，一百一十八个厂矿企业推广应用线性规划，形成了一个大学线性规划、大用线性规划的全民运动。工农群众一旦掌握了现代数学知识，立即显出了非凡的才能，提出了许多数学工作者们未曾预料到的新课题。交通运输中的“梯形发车法”“差乘派船定理”等，都是先由工人提出，又由师生们研究成功的。济南市已有九十二名工人和企业管理人员被聘为省科学分院数学研究所的兼职研究员。
    目前，线性规划及运筹学的其它某些分支已经广泛应用到工农业生产及国民经济许多部门中来，为生产服务，为生活服务。运用线性规划中的“图上作业法”“表上作业法”，进行车辆调度，在城市一般可提高里程利用率10％，在专区和县可提高15％—20％；用它合理调拨物资，可节省运力10％左右。济南铁路管理局运用线性规划合理安排货运，1至4月份节省运力达一万八千二百三十六万吨公里；济南市近五个月内节省的运力，等于九百零四辆汽车一个月的载运量。据有关方面计算，仅以上两项节省的运力，就相当于一列挂有五十辆车皮（各载重四十吨）的火车，在从济南到北京四百九十七公里的里程上，往返一百一十三次。经验证明，运用线性规划方法，制订物资合理调拨方案，合理解决长短途运输衔接问题，合理组织货源，安排货运，合理调度车辆，不论现代交通工具还是民间运输工具，都可提高里程利用率。
    线性规划在工农业中应用，也很成功。青岛国棉一厂过去一人看四十八台车，每天需巡回六十至七十里，经过运用线性规划调整后，每人少走七里路，还可多看四至五台车。线性规划用于人民公社劳力合理调配、作物合理布局、土地合理利用、水渠合理规划、肥料合理运送等方面，也有显著成效。目前，线性规划应用范围，已发展到基本建设、邮件投递、电线架设、畜牧场、加工厂、拖拉机站和居民点布局及缝纫业、窑业、酿造业等许多方面，并且都在各种不同程度上节省了人力、物力和财力。
    数学工作者们在生产实际中，发现有各种各样的数学问题迫切需要解决。当前，他们已不单纯限于线性规划的研究与应用，而正在向非线性规划、动态规划，以及运筹学的其他分支，如排队论、博奕论、网络理论等，进行探索。
    在数学广泛联系生产实际的研究中，数学工作者在理论探讨上，也有很大收获。他们从丰富的实践中创造和改进了一些新的数学计算方法，在理论上引进了一些新的概念，得出了一些新的定理和推论，并写出了五十多篇有重要价值的论文，还编著了“数学规划论讲义”“数理统计与质量控制”等九本书，积累了约一百二十多万字的资料。曲阜师范学院探索出的“多个函数的最大最小问题”，创造性地应用线性规划方法解决非线性规划问题，具有相当理论价值。
    山东数学工作者们，在数学研究中所采取的这种方法，也促进了数学科系的发展和教学质量的提高，并培养和扩大了数学师资队伍。引起了数学领域的教学革命。山东大学、山东师范学院等，根据生产建设的需要，把运筹学、概率论、微分方程、计算数学等，作为重要课程。山东大学并开设了数学规划专门化，建立了计算数学和概率论教研组。其它院校在这方面也都有了相应的发展。1958年以前，山东在运筹学方面还是一个空白，现在已有很多人能胜任这门全新的课程。通过这个时期的生产实践，各院校数学系师生普遍感到不能再用老办法教下去和学下去了，他们用大量事实揭发了数学教学中的少慢差费现象，制订出了新的教学改革方案，在课程体系、课程内容方面做了许多调整。
