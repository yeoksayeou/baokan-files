The peace-loving people of the world have been moved and encouraged by the great manifestations of the Japanese people's struggle for peace in recent years, particularly in recent months.

In their nationwide movement, the Japanese people have collected 50 million signatures expressing opposition to nuclear weapons and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Since April 1959, the Japanese people have conducted twenty-two nationwide unified actions against this alliance. The valiant Japanese people refused to allow Eisenhower to visit Japan and forced Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to agree to resign, thus dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. government's attempt to stabilize the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group and strengthen its aggressive policy in the Far East. This struggle of the Japanese people is not only unprecedented in the history of Japan, but also greatly encourages the cause of world peace and the struggle against aggression. These historic victories of the Japanese people are victories for all peace-loving people around the world – including the majority of the American people who long for peace. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council wholeheartedly pays tribute to the Japanese people and will make every effort to support their just and patriotic struggle for the final abolition of this treaty.

The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament will be held in Tokyo from August 2 to 9. The World Peace Council has consistently supported the previous World Conferences Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, and will continue to fully support them. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council calls on the national peace committees to pay attention to the great significance of this Tokyo conference, which will be held at a time when the struggle of the Japanese people is booming.

    关于日本的决议
    全世界爱好和平的人民由于最近几年内，特别是最近几个月内日本人民争取和平活动的伟大表现而受到感动和鼓舞。
    日本人民在他们的全国性运动中已经征集到五千万个签名表示反对核武器和日美军事同盟条约。自从1959年4月以来，日本人民已经进行了二十二次反对这个同盟的全国统一行动。英勇的日本人民拒绝允许艾森豪威尔访问日本，并且迫使岸信介首相同意辞职，这样就使美国政府稳定东南亚条约组织集团和加强它在远东的侵略政策的企图遭到沉重的打击。日本人民的这种斗争不仅在日本的历史上是空前的，而且也大大鼓舞了世界和平事业和反对侵略的斗争。日本人民的这些具有历史意义的胜利是全世界爱好和平人民——其中包括切望和平的大部分美国人民在内——的胜利。世界和平理事会常务委员会衷心地向日本人民致敬，并且将尽一切努力支持他们为最后废除这项条约而进行的正义和爱国的斗争。
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会将在8月2日到9日在东京举行。世界和平理事会一贯支持历届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会，并且将继续完全支持它们。世界和平理事会常务委员会号召各国和平委员会注意将在日本人民的斗争蓬勃发展的时候举行的这次东京会议的巨大意义。
