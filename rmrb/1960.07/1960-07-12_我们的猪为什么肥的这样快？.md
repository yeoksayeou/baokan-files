　　Why are our pigs getting fat so fast?
    In our Fenghuo Commune, Taoyuan Brigade pig farm, out of 110 pigs, 65 were classified as third-class pigs in the first half of the month, but in the second half of the month, they all gained weight and were promoted to second-class pigs, and second-class pigs were promoted to first-class pigs. How did the pigs change so much in half a month? The breeder, Old Zheng, pointed to the luggage placed over there and said to me:
  “It’s because Secretary Meng of the commune (Meng Xiangcun, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee) is living here with us.” Before Old Zheng could finish, the breeder, Old Deng, interjected: “As soon as Secretary Meng arrived, he went to the pig feed pot, grabbed a handful of pig feed, and examined it carefully. He found that the peanut husks for feeding the pigs were thick and hard, and there was sand in them, so he said: "How can such feed fatten the pigs?" We said that if there is no good feed, we have to make do with it. After discussing it for a while, he helped us harness the cart to cut feed. Secretary Meng drove the cart, and we went to the mountains to cut a full cart of wild grape seedlings, apricot leaf vegetables, and other wild green feed. When we returned, he became the "pig chef," grinding the peanut husks and wild vegetables finely and cooking them thoroughly. After cooking, Secretary Meng even licked and tasted the flavor with his tongue. As a result, the pigs loved to eat it very much, and their appetite increased greatly, and they gained weight quickly. Old Deng said happily with a smile: "Our Secretary Meng not only makes sure the pigs are full, but also pays special attention to hygiene, bathing the pigs every noon. If it weren't for Secretary Meng's careful care, our "Old Spotted Face" (sick pig) would probably have lost its life."

　　我们的猪为什么肥的这样快？
    我们坟坨公社桃元大队养猪场一百一十头猪中，上半月有六十五头是三类猪，到了下半月，一个个都吃胖了，上升为二类猪，二类猪上升为一类猪了。怎么半个月的工夫猪就变了样？饲养员老郑指着那边放的行李对我说：
  “这不是，公社孟书记
  （公社党委第二书记孟祥存）住在我们这里了。”没等老郑说完，饲养员老邓就接口说：“孟书记一来就到猪食锅前，抓一把猪食细瞧细看。他发现喂猪的花生皮子又粗又硬，里边还有沙子，就说：“这样的饲料，怎么能把猪喂肥呢？”我们说，没有好饲料，就得凑合着喂。商量了一阵，他就帮我们套车，去割饲料。孟书记赶着车，我们到山上割了满满一车野葡萄秧、杏叶菜等野生青饲料。回来，他就当上了“猪厨师”，花生皮和野菜磨的细、煮的烂。煮好了，孟书记还用舌头舐舐尝尝味道。这样一来猪非常爱吃，食量大大增加，上膘也快了。老邓高兴地笑着又说：“我们的孟书记不但叫猪吃得饱，还特别讲卫生，每天中午给猪洗澡，我们的那个“老花脸”，
  （病猪）要不是孟书记细心照料，恐怕命都保不住。”
