    " 'Multi-Treasure Matching' is a magic weapon; whoever uses it will have high efficiency." This is an experience we have personally realized recently by using the "Multi-Treasure Machine Tool."
      "Multi-Treasure Matching" is the best way to promote advanced experiences in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is the best method to closely combine with production and make various advanced experiences a large-scale harvest. Because, applying "Multi-Treasure Matching" on machine tools can systematically summarize, learn from each other's strengths, and improve the advanced experiences and technologies created by everyone. Take our Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking workshop as an example; due to vigorously promoting "Multi-Treasure Matching," more than eighty production workers in the entire workshop have achieved "one equals two" every day.
    "Multi-Treasure Matching" is a new thing, and its promotion is not always smooth. Some young people in our workshop were not very active at the beginning. Some thought it was "unaccustomed" and were unwilling to use it. Of course, mastering a new technology or experience is not that easy, and it will not be mastered and operated freely upon contact. It must go through a period of practice to understand and grasp its rules.
    In order to enable everyone to master and use various effective advanced experiences, our workshop party branch widely carried out the "Multi-Treasure Matching" movement in the workshop, held skill competitions, and organized colorful "Knife Competition Meetings" and "Treasure Delivery Teams" in full swing. They also organized special personnel to repeatedly demonstrate the various experiences of "Multi-Treasure Matching" and set an example, so that some people who were not accustomed to using "Multi-Treasure Matching" had their thoughts cleared and actively participated in this movement. Therefore, the entire workshop quickly realized a "Multi-Treasure Matching" workshop. Vigorously promoting "Multi-Treasure Matching" has become a powerful guarantee for achieving a substantial increase in production.
    In the great competition of high production, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and no accidents, let us all fully utilize "Multi-Treasure Matching"! And let's compare who uses it the most, the fastest, and the best, and see who makes the greatest contribution to the Party and socialist construction in realizing this year's sustained Great Leap Forward!

### 把“宝”配起套来

　　把“宝”配起套来

    “‘多宝配套’是法宝，谁用谁就效率高”。这是我们近来运用“多宝机床”亲自体会到的一条经验。
      “多宝配套”是多快好省地推广先进经验的最好形式，是密切结合生产，使各种先进经验，大面积丰收的最好方法。因为，在机床上运用“多宝配套”，可以把大伙创造的先进经验、先进技术，系统地总结起来，取长补短，加以提高。就拿我们沈阳变压器厂金工车间来说吧，由于大搞“多宝配套”，全车间有八十多名生产工人天天达到了“一顶两”。
    “多宝配套”是一个新生事物，在推广当中，也不是那么顺顺当当的。我们车间有一些年青人，开始时不太积极，有的认为“不习惯”，不愿意去运用。当然，掌握一件新技术、新经验，不是那么容易的，也不会一接触马上就能掌握起来操纵自如的，必须经过一个时期的实践过程，从中了解和掌握它的规律。
    我们车间党支部为了使每个人都能掌握和运用各种行之有效的先进经验，在车间广泛开展了“多宝配套”运动，比武竞赛，丰富多彩的“赛刀会”、“送宝队”，搞得热火朝天，并组织专人反复表演“多宝配套”的各项经验，做出样子来，从而使一些运用“多宝配套”不习惯的人，思想搞通了，而且还积极的参与了这一运动。因此，全车间很快的实现了“多宝配套”车间。大搞“多宝配套”，成了实现大幅度高产的有力保证。
    让我们在高产、优质、多品种、低成本、无事故的大竞赛中，都来充分运用“多宝配套”！并且比一比谁用得最多，最快、最好，看谁在实现今年持续的大跃进中，对党和社会主义建设的贡献最大！
