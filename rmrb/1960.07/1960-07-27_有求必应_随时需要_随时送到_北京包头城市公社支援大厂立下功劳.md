Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Many factories established by the Beijing Urban People's Commune are now actively producing various raw materials, materials, auxiliary materials, and parts to support the continuous leap forward of major factories.

The raw materials, materials, and parts that these commune-run factories process and produce for major factories cover a wide range, including metallurgical auxiliary materials, chemical materials, electromechanical materials, and machine parts. Some commune-run factories have even set up their factory sites near major factories, producing the materials needed by the major factories, ensuring delivery whenever needed, and ensuring that major factories do not delay production. The Guang'anmenwai People's Commune built a stone powder factory next to the Beijing Steel Plant, transporting ore from the countryside to specialize in the production of quartz powder and coke powder for steelmaking, promptly supplying the steel plant's production needs. The Yuetan People's Commune Stone Powder Factory produces five or six kinds of raw materials and materials, including quartz stone for steelmaking and glassmaking, as well as the chemical raw material fluorite. The manganese sand they produce has become the main material for making welding rods at the Huairou County Agricultural Machinery Factory. The Carbon Rod Factory affiliated to the Exhibition Hall Road People's Commune sent people to Shenyang to learn the technique of manufacturing metallurgical carbon rods using indigenous methods. After self-manufacturing equipment, it expanded into a factory producing carbon rods for electric furnace steelmaking. Its products are supplied to more than 20 units in Beijing, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, and other places for electric furnace steelmaking.

Many commune-run factories serving large-scale industry generally strive to "respond to every request." The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant often needs more than 40 kinds of special-shaped refractory bricks, which in the past were all supplied from other places. Because the types of special-shaped bricks are complex and the required specifications and styles often change, it was very inconvenient to find production outside. Later, they found the Dongzhimen People's Commune Refractory Brick Factory. Although the production personnel of this factory had never even seen the appearance of special-shaped bricks, in order to implement the principle of commune-run factories serving large-scale industry, they resolutely accepted this production task. Everyone worked together to make wooden molds to replace iron molds. When the molds were made, the brick blanks could not be loaded, so they tried every means to overcome the difficulties and finally completed the task on time, ensuring the needs of the automobile manufacturing plant. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company needed a large current transformer, but could not buy it elsewhere. Finally, they found the Dashilan People's Commune Motor Factory. The factory's production personnel, hearing that Shijingshan Steel needed it, immediately temporarily put aside the original less urgent products, and made the current transformer in a concentrated effort for ten days. After Shijingshan Steel tested it, it fully met the requirements.

Many commune-run factories use the waste materials from large factories for refining, processing, and producing various raw materials, materials, and parts for large factories. The Xinjiekou People's Commune Hardware Casting Machinery Factory is linked to many large factories, selecting copper filings, aluminum filings, and other materials from the waste piles of large factories for production. In the first half of this year, they pulled back waste materials such as machine tool swarf from units such as the Beijing Automobile Repair and Parts Factory, refining more than 15,000 kilograms of copper and more than 3,200 kilograms of aluminum.

This newspaper reports: The 600,000 members of various ethnic groups in Baotou, the emerging industrial city on the frontier, have made great contributions by vigorously developing commune industry to support the production and construction of Baotou Steel and other factories and mines. At present, there are more than 1,200 commune-run industrial production units in the city, producing more than 1,800 kinds of building auxiliary materials, small hardware, chemicals, and daily necessities.

The people's communes of Baotou City all regard supporting the production and construction of Baotou Steel as a glorious task, and have successively put forward the slogan "Be a capable assistant to large factories and mines, and accelerate the speed of production and construction of Baotou Steel." The Electromechanical People's Commune, mainly composed of family members of employees of the Baotou Steel Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company, currently processes and produces more than 100 kinds of products for Baotou Steel. The welding rod factory of this commune, with the help of veteran technicians from the company, has produced a large number of qualified welding rods, which not only meet the needs of the electromechanical company, but also support other units. In mid-May of this year, the Installation Company of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering urgently needed lead wire mesh for pipeline insulation in the installation project of the Baotou First Thermal Power Plant. At that time, it could not be bought on the market, and if it was commissioned to an outside unit for processing, it would take three months to complete. The Yuejin Factory of the upstream People's Commune of this company immediately organized a shock team. Twenty-eight commune members fought hard for thirteen days to complete the weaving task of more than 1,200 square meters of lead wire mesh with guaranteed quality and quantity, ensuring the smooth construction of the thermal power plant.

Some people's communes, according to the special needs of state-owned factories and mines, have organized various units such as coking teams, construction teams, and life service stations to directly support the production of workers at construction sites and factories and mines; at the same time, they make full use of the edge materials and waste materials from factories and mines in the city to produce a large number of small daily commodities to supply market needs.

Baotou Steel, the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Baotou Mining Bureau, and the municipal construction, industrial production departments all regard commune-run industry as their own "satellite" factories, and continuously provide assistance in terms of factory buildings, equipment, manpower, technology, and material supply. This has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the commune members. The People's Commune is currently strengthening the leadership of commune-run industry, making full use of edge materials, waste materials, and natural resources to vigorously produce accessories, raw materials, and small commodities needed by large factories and mines, agricultural and animal husbandry production, and people's lives.

### 有求必应　随时需要　随时送到  北京包头城市公社支援大厂立下功劳

    有求必应　随时需要　随时送到
    北京包头城市公社支援大厂立下功劳
    新华社26日讯　北京城市人民公社兴办的许多工厂，现正积极生产各种原料、材料、辅助材料和配件，支援大工厂持续跃进。
    这些社办工厂为大工厂加工和生产的原料、材料和配件的项目很多，有冶金辅助材料，也有化工材料；有机电材料，也有机器的配件。有些社办工厂把厂址都设在大厂附近，生产大厂所需的材料，做到随时需要随时送到，确保大厂不误生产。广安门外人民公社在北京钢厂旁边，建起一个石粉厂，从农村运来矿石专门生产炼钢用的石英粉和焦炭粉，及时供应钢厂的生产需要。月坛人民公社石粉厂生产五、六种原料、材料，有炼钢和制玻璃用的石英石，也有化工原料氟石。他们生产的锰砂成了怀柔县农业机械厂制作焊条的主要材料。展览馆路人民公社所属炭精棒厂派人到沈阳学习土法制造冶金炭精棒的技术后，自制设备，扩建成生产电炉炼钢使用的炭精棒的工厂，产品供应北京、重庆、内蒙古等地二十多个单位电炉炼钢使用。
    许多社办工厂为大工业服务，一般都力争做到“有求必应”。北京汽车制造厂经常需要四十多种的异型耐火砖，过去全靠外地供应，因为异型砖品种复杂，需要的规格样式又经常变动，找外地生产很不方便，后来他们找到了东直门人民公社耐火砖厂。这个厂的生产人员虽然连异型砖的样子都没见过，但是他们为贯彻执行社办工厂为大工业服务的方针，坚决接受了这项生产任务，大家动手作木模子代替铁模子。模子作出来装不下去砖坯，便想尽办法克服困难，终于按时完成任务，保证汽车制造厂的需要。石景山钢铁公司需要一个大的电流互感器，到外地没有买到，最后找到大栅栏人民公社电机厂。厂里生产人员听说是石钢需要，立即暂时放下原来不太急需的产品，突击十天，把电流互感器制成了，经石钢试用完全合乎要求。
    很多社办工厂是利用大厂的废料进行提炼，为大厂加工和生产各种原料、材料和配件。新街口人民公社五金铸造机械厂和许多大工厂挂钩，从大工厂的废料堆里挑选些铜沫和铝沫等作原料进行生产。今年上半年，他们从北京市汽车修配厂等单位拉回机床切屑沫等废料，提炼出铜一万五千多公斤，铝三千二百多公斤。
    本报讯　塞外新兴工业城市——包头市的六十多万各民族社员，大办公社工业，在支援包钢等厂矿生产建设中立下汗马功劳。目前，全市社办工业生产单位共达一千二百多个，生产一千八百多种建筑辅助材料、小五金、化工以及日用百货等产品。
    包头市各人民公社，都以支援包钢生产建设作为光荣的任务，纷纷提出“当好大厂矿的得力助手，加快包钢生产建设速度”的口号。由包钢机电安装工程公司职工家属为主体组成的机电人民公社，目前为包钢加工生产的产品达一百多种。这个公社的电焊条厂，经过公司老技工的帮助，已经生产了大批合格的电焊条，不但满足了机电公司需要，还支援其它单位。今年5月中旬，建筑工程部第二工程局安装公司在包头第一热电厂安装工程中，急需管道保温用的铅丝网，当时市场上买不到，若委托外单位加工，要三个月才能完成。这个公司的上游人民公社跃进工厂闻讯后，立即组织突击队，二十八名社员奋战十三天，保质保量地完成了一千二百多平方米铅丝网的编织任务，保证热电厂施工顺利进行。
    有些人民公社根据国营厂矿的特殊需要，组织了炼焦队、基建队、生活服务站等多种多样的单位，直接到建设工地和厂矿去支援职工生产；同时，充分利用市内厂矿边材废料生产大量日用小商品，供应市场需要。
    包钢、中央建筑工程部第二工程局、包头矿务局和市属基建、工业生产部门，都把社办工业当成自己的“卫星”厂，从厂房、设备、人力、技术、材料供应等方面，不断给予帮助。这样，更激发了公社社员的积极性。人民公社目前正在加强对社办工业的领导，充分利用边材废料和自然资源，大力生产大厂矿、农牧业生产和人民生活需要的配件、原料和小商品。
