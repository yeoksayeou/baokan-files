Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Leopoldville News: The Congolese government yesterday expressed regret over the United Nations Security Council's decision to continue meeting to discuss the Congo issue without waiting for Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba to arrive in New York.

    Lumumba had earlier announced that he would personally go to New York to present the Congolese government's views on the Belgian aggression against the Congo to the Security Council. He requested the United Nations to provide him with transportation, but was refused.

    A Congolese government spokesman said at a press conference yesterday: "The Congolese government regrets to learn of this decision by the Security Council, because it believes that the Security Council should have done everything possible to give us the opportunity to express our views." The spokesman said: "The Congolese government notes that the Belgian government has been given full facilities to state its position."

    The spokesman quoted a communique issued by the Congolese government as saying: "The (Congolese) government, through Dr. Bunch, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General in Leopoldville, requested the Security Council to suspend the meeting until Prime Minister Lumumba arrived in New York."

    It is reported that Lumumba requested transportation to New York, but he received the reply: "This will be impossible because all aircraft are fully occupied with airlift operations."

    联合国阻挠卢蒙巴出席安理会
    不等刚果政府表达意见就作出决定
    新华社22日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果政府昨天对联合国安全理事会不等待刚果总理卢蒙巴到达纽约而继续开会讨论刚果问题的决定，表示遗憾。
    卢蒙巴早些时候曾经宣布，他将亲自前往纽约，向安理会申述刚果政府对比利时侵略刚果的意见。他要求联合国为他提供交通工具，但是遭到拒绝。
    刚果政府发言人昨天在记者招待会上说：“刚果政府遗憾地得知安全理事会这项决定，因为它认为安全理事会本来应该尽一切可能给我们机会来表达我们的观点。”这位发言人说：“刚果政府注意到：比利时政府已经得到充分的便利来陈述它的立场。”
    这位发言人引述刚果政府发表的一项公报说：“（刚果）政府通过在利奥波德维尔的联合国副秘书长本奇博士，要求安理会在卢蒙巴总理抵达纽约以前暂停会议”。
    据报道，卢蒙巴要求为他提供去纽约的交通工具，但是他得到的回答是：“这将是不可能的，因为一切飞机都完全用在空运方面。”
