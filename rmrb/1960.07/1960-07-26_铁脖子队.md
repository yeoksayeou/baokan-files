    Iron Necks Team
    Jinan Instrument Factory, Chen Chunlie
    A crash mission, assigned to the Iron Necks Team: thirty-three tons of fertilizer powder, to be transported to the rural commune overnight. The captain, Iron Neck Old Li, immediately gathered the young men, ten steel-like youths, standing together like chimneys. A rapid pre-battle meeting, once again reiterating a truth: the Iron Necks Team is a leaping steed, to "skillfully work," adding wings to it. Born with a worker's character, specially attacking difficulties, pointing to the squatting flatbed carts, Iron Neck Captain began to speak:
    "Old flatbed carts, heads down pulling like 'old oxen climbing', my grandfather spent his life under this handlebar, my father also became a skeleton... Flatbed carts, oh flatbed carts, workers in the old society didn't even like to pull them, in the Great Leap Forward era, we sing new songs, our Iron Necks Team must stride like a thousand-mile horse!" Twenty magical hands, raised high and slammed down hard, the sound of hammers and axes shook down the sunset, the flowers of innovation bloomed like a sky full of colorful clouds. Ten flatbed carts were immediately modified, "Lightning Wind" replaced "old oxen climbing". Quickly transfer, quickly load, lifting the heavy fertilizer powder, hearts full of joy. Wow, ten Iron Necks, in the blink of an eye, loaded ten large carts; the loudspeaker broadcast a strong wind warning, but the captain said: "Perfect, a south wind all the way!"
    Sha! Sha! Sha! The wheels crushed the flying sand; Hua! Hua! Hua! The winged iron horses shot out like rapid arrows... The Iron Necks Team's reputation inspired the enthusiasm of the entire factory, the Iron Necks Team galloped like a steed, scattering the fresh flowers of communism along the way!
