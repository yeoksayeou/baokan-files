Henan commercial departments are supporting agricultural technical transformation.
Tightly focusing on agricultural production, they are helping commune-run industries comprehensively utilize local steel and iron to manufacture agricultural machinery and tools, and develop local fertilizer and pesticide production. In the first half of this year, the province's supply of agricultural production materials increased by more than half compared to the same period last year.
Chongqing's 100,000 finance and trade workers launch a "Deliver Grain to the Countryside" campaign.
Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: In the high tide of accelerating agricultural technical transformation in Henan Province, commercial departments at all levels resolutely implement the policy of "self-reliance as the primary focus, striving for external assistance as a supplement." They vigorously carry out mass movements, organize commune-run factories, obtain materials locally, produce locally, and supply locally. In the first half of this year, the province's supply of agricultural production materials increased by more than half compared to the same period last year. Local sources of agricultural production materials have greatly increased. For example, Xuchang Prefecture, which previously relied on external supply for 70% of its goods, now obtains 70% of its goods locally. Commercial department employees help local industrial departments implement comprehensive utilization of local steel and iron, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient steel materials. More than 600 county and commune machinery factories across the province have used local steel and iron to manufacture more than 1,300 kinds of agricultural machinery, power machinery, and so on. For example, Linxian County has made water turbines and small train heads, Fugou County has made simple portable boilers; ? County has made 100-kilowatt generators; Yancheng County has made more than 500 kinds of power machinery, agricultural machinery, small farm tools, and machine parts, of which 350 kinds can be self-sufficient. At present, the province can produce more than 100 kinds of local fertilizers and pesticides. The Kaifeng County commercial department extracted 14 technicians to help communes and production teams train 1,600 technical personnel in the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides. The county's daily fertilizer production increased more than four times compared to January, and local pesticides achieved a surplus.

Recently, commercial departments in various parts of Henan Province summarized ten experiences in collaborating with industrial departments to support agricultural technical transformation from practice. These ten experiences are: (1) Understand the situation and reflect the needs: Before each production season or the arrival of the Party's central work, industrial and commercial departments send people deep into the countryside to investigate needs and organize production and supply. (2) Participate in production and solve difficulties: Many regions have turned purchasing agents into resident factory workers, regarding the factory's difficulties as their own and trying their best to help solve them. (3) Production, demand, supply, and sales are planned and connected: The plan for agricultural needs for production materials is transformed into a factory production plan and a commercial supply plan, which are connected and promote each other. (4) Profits are evenly divided, losses are borne alone: In the process of trial production of new products, Yancheng County adopted three measures: industrial profits are higher than commercial profits for normal profits; industrial profits are for marginal profits, and commercial profits are guaranteed; commercial losses are borne, and industrial losses are guaranteed, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of industrial departments. (5) Timely purchase and early supply: This not only does not occupy factory funds but also meets the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner. (6) Industry and commerce understand each other, cooperate closely, and serve agriculture with all their strength. (7) Help build systems and improve management. (8) Give up honors and strive for tasks. (9) Transmit information and exchange experiences: Commercial departments use their advantageous conditions of wide contact to promptly introduce advanced experiences from other places to industrial departments and help promote improvement, and jointly solve key problems in production. (10) One place is in trouble, and all parties provide support. (11) Set up demonstration factories and make examples: Commercial departments run experimental factories and provide models to commune-run industries for factories to produce.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 12th: 100,000 employees of Chongqing's finance and trade departments have launched a large-scale mass movement to "Deliver Grain to the Countryside," vigorously supporting agriculture.

The "Deliver Grain" movement is a new measure taken by financial and trade departments at all levels in Chongqing this year to support agricultural production increase. This year, the quantity of production materials needed in rural areas is large, the variety is large, and the time is concentrated. When arranging the supply plan, the financial and trade departments proposed the slogan "Get ahead of the agricultural production season and take the initiative to deliver grain to the rural people's communes," changing the previous work style of "waiting for customers to come to the door." In the various agricultural production seasons in the first half of this year, the city-level commercial departments carried out seven mass "Deliver Grain" movements. As of now, agricultural machinery equipment, earth, stone, and wood tools, and transportation tools with a total value of more than 8 million yuan have been directly delivered to the front line of agricultural production, accounting for 40% of the total supply of production materials by city-level commercial units. The supply of many production materials in the third quarter has increased again. At present, a large number of fertilizers and pesticides are being sent to the countryside. Units such as the Electrical and Hardware Materials Company, the Grain Department, and the Chemical Raw Materials Wholesale Station have established "Deliver Grain" teams, using a large number of cars and ships to promptly deliver production materials to counties such as Baxian, Qijiang, and Changshou. The "Deliver Grain" movement of commercial departments in various districts and counties is more frequent and has a greater momentum. In three months, the commercial department in the Gelan area of Changshou County dispatched more than 30,000 people (times) to deliver more than 20,000 pieces of bamboo and wooden farm tools and more than 200,000 jin of agricultural fertilizer and pesticides to production teams.

　　河南商业部门支援农业技术改造
    紧紧围绕农业生产，帮助社办工业综合利用土钢土铁，制造农业机械和工具，发展土化肥土农药生产；今年上半年全省农业生产资料供应额比去年同期增长一半以上
　　重庆十万财贸职工开展为农村“送粮”运动
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省在加速农业技术改造的高潮中，各地商业部门坚决贯彻执行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，大搞群众运动，组织社办工厂，就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。今年上半年，全省的农业生产资料供应额比去年同期增长一半以上。在农业生产资料的货源中，地方货源大大增加，如许昌专区过去70％的货源依靠外地供应，现在变为70％的货源从本地取得。商业部门职工帮助地方工业部门实行土钢土铁综合利用，克服了钢铁材料不足的困难。全省已有六百多个县、社机械厂用土钢土铁制造出各种农业机具、动力机械等共一千三百多种。如林县制成了水轮机、小火车头，扶沟县制成了简易锅驼机；?县制成了一百瓩的发电机；郾城县制出五百多种动力机械、农业机具、小农具和机械零件，其中有三百五十种能够自给。现在全省能生产土化肥、土农药一百多种。开封县商业部门抽出十四名技术员，帮助公社和生产队训练了一千六百名制造化肥、农药的技术人才，全县化肥日产量比1月份增加了四倍多，土农药达到了自给有余。
    最近，河南省各地商业部门从实践中，总结出了十一条与工业部门协作支援农业技术改造的经验。这十一条经验是：（1）了解情况，反映需要：每当生产季节或党的中心工作到来之前，工商部门都派人深入农村，调查需要，组织生产和供应。（2）参与生产，解决困难：许多地区把采购员变为驻厂员，把工厂的困难视为自己的困难，尽力帮助解决。（3）产需供销，计划衔接：把农业需要生产资料的计划，变为工厂生产计划和商业供应计划，相互衔接，相互促进。（4）利润均分，亏损独担：在新产品的试制过程中，郾城采取三项措施，有正常利润者工高于商；有微利者归工业，商业保本；亏损者商业负担，工业保本，这样大大促进了工业部门的积极性。（5）及时收购，提前供应：这样既不占压工厂资金，又能及时满足农业生产的需要。（6）工商互相了解，密切协作，通力为农业服务。（7）帮建制度，改进管理。（8）让荣誉，争任务。（9）传递情报，交流经验：商业部门利用自己联系面广的有利条件，及时向工业部门介绍外地的先进经验，并帮助推广提高，共同解决生产中的关键问题。（10）一地困难，八方支援。（11）搞示范厂，作出样子：商业部门办试验工厂，给社办工业拿出样板，交工厂生产。
    本报重庆12日电　重庆市财贸部门十万名职工开展了大规模的为农村“送粮”的群众运动，大力支援农业。
    “送粮”运动是今年重庆各级财贸部门支援农业增产的一项新措施。今年农村需要的生产资料的数量大、品种多、时间集中，财贸部门在安排供应计划时，提出了“赶在农业生产季节前面，主动为农村人民公社送粮上门”的口号，改变了往年“等客上门”的工作作风。在今年上半年的各个农业生产季节中，全市市级商业部门开展了七次群众性的送粮运动，截至目前，已有总值八百多万元的农业机械设备、土石木工具和交通运输工具直接送到了农业生产第一线，占市级商业单位生产资料供应总额的40％。第三季度许多生产资料的供应量又有上升。目前大批化肥、农药正送往农村。交电五金器材公司、粮食部门、化工原料批发站等单位，专门成立了“送粮”大队，动用大批汽车、船只及时把生产资料送到巴县、綦江、长寿等县。各区、县商业部门的“送粮”运动更加频繁，声势更大。长寿县葛兰地区商业部门在三个月中先后出动三万多人（次），把二万多件竹制、木制农具，二十万多斤农肥、农药送到生产队。（附图片）
