Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 29th. Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei Province has vigorously grasped the comprehensive technological transformation of the mining transportation system, promoting sustained high production of iron ore. Since the beginning of this year, the company has overfulfilled its production plans every month, the ore grade has significantly improved, and costs have also been reduced considerably. Since entering July, it has continuously set the highest daily production records of the year.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers of Longyan Iron and Steel Company, targeting the key problem of backward transportation, proposed to ensure high production with high transportation efficiency. They formulated technical transformation plans at all levels and organized campaigns to carry out comprehensive technical transformation of the mining transportation system. The mining transportation system mainly includes ore scraping at the mining face in the pit, ore transportation in the level lanes and horizontal adits (main lanes), and ore storage and loading outside the pit. The comprehensive technical transformation is aimed at these links. To this end, Pangjiabao Mine and Yantongshan Mine have specially set up organizations to manage transportation and deputy mine directors in charge of transportation to strengthen leadership of the transportation work inside and outside the mines.

The transformation work first focused on the manual trolley in the underground level lanes, which had the greatest impact on production and occupied the most labor. With the spirit of daring to think and act, the workers, in just a few months, equipped all transportation roadways with locally made electric cars and stepless speed control cars, eliminating the manual trolley that had been used for many years, increasing transportation efficiency by more than double, and fundamentally solving the problem of level lane transportation affecting production in the past. Subsequently, the workers further successfully developed the automation of mine car coupling, uncoupling, overturning, and switches, resulting in an automated assembly line for underground transportation, further shortening auxiliary time and increasing effective production time.

Secondly, in terms of ore scraping and transportation at the mining face, the workers created a foldable electric scraper to replace the original electric scraper for ore scraping and implemented remote control. This not only eliminated an ore scraping process and generally increased ore scraping efficiency by more than 30%, but also ensured that most of the ore blasted down after blasting at the mining face could be scraped out in time, and also saved half of the labor.

Thirdly, the horizontal adit is the main passage for transporting ore from the pit to the loading point outside the pit. The main measures to improve horizontal adit transportation are to tap the potential of existing transportation equipment. On the one hand, workers were mobilized to carry out competitions for fast loading, fast unloading, more hauling, and fast running. On the other hand, mechanical repair forces were organized to strengthen the inspection and maintenance of electric cars and mine cars, and the transportation tracks and power lines were repaired to create good conditions for more hauling and fast running.

Fourthly, in terms of transportation outside the pit, ore storage bins and timber chutes have been expanded and will continue to be built. One of the two earthen ore storage bins expanded by Yantongshan Mine was put into production at the end of June. With the original ore storage bin, the mine can now continue to produce normally even if trains do not come for two days, and can continue to load even if production is stopped for two days. Pangjiabao Mine has renovated the original ore storage bin and added anti-freeze equipment, but it is still not enough. It is now collecting materials to build a new earthen ore storage bin.

Through the comprehensive technical transformation of the transportation system, these two iron mines have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of transportation inside and outside the pit, and the transportation capacity has been greatly improved. In June of this year, ore production increased by about 13% compared with the same period last year, basically achieving how much is mined in the pit is how much is transported out. The improvement of transportation efficiency has created extremely favorable conditions for further increasing ore production. Since entering July, the workers have launched a mass movement to revolutionize mining methods, striving to increase ore production. The workers of Pangjiabao Mine alone have proposed more than a dozen new mining methods based on local conditions. After identification and matching, these methods have been initially summarized into eight sets of better mining methods, which are being rapidly promoted. As a result of promoting advanced mining methods, the number of mining teams in Pangjiabao Mine with a monthly ore production of over 10,000 tons has increased from one in January to six since June.

    龙烟钢铁公司矿山运输技术改造搞得好
    运输畅通无阻  矿工放手增产
    坑内：消灭人力推车大搞自动化
    坑外：增建储煤仓提高装车效率
    据新华社天津29日电　河北省龙烟钢铁公司大抓矿山运输系统的全面技术改造，促进了铁矿石的持续高产。今年以来，这个公司月月超额完成生产计划，矿石品位显著提高，成本也降低不少。进入7月份以来，连续创造了今年以来的最高日产纪录。
    龙烟钢铁公司职工在技术革新和技术革命运动中，针对运输落后的关键，提出要以高运保高产，层层制定技术改造规划，组织战役，
  对矿山运输系统进行了全面技术改造。矿山运输系统，主要包括坑下采矿面的扒矿，平巷、平峒（大巷）的运矿，以及坑外的储矿和装车等。全面技术改造就是针对以上几个环节进行的。为此，庞家堡矿和烟筒山矿，都专门增设了管理运输的机构和专管运输的副矿长，加强领导矿内矿外运输工作。
    改造工作首先是针对着影响生产最大、占用劳动力最多的坑下平巷人力推车。职工们以敢想敢干的精神，在短短的几个月内，就用自己创造成功的土电车和无极车，装备了全部运输巷道，消灭了多少年来一直沿用的人力推车，提高运输效率一倍以上，从根本上解决了过去平巷运输影响生产的问题。接着，职工们又进一步研究成功矿车挂钩、摘钩、翻车和道岔的自动化，出现了坑内运输的自动化一条龙，进一步缩短辅助时间，增加了生产有效时间。
    其次，在采矿面的扒矿运输方面，职工们创造了一种折叠式的电耙子，代替原来的电耙子扒矿，并实行远距离操纵，这不但取消了一道扒矿工序，扒矿效率普遍提高30％以上，绝大部分采矿面放炮后崩下来的矿石，都能及时扒出来，而且节约一半人力。
    第三，平峒是把矿石从坑下运到坑外装车点的干道。提高平峒运输的主要措施，是挖掘现有运输设备潜力。一方面，发动职工开展快装、快卸、多拉、快跑的竞赛，一方面，组织机修力量，加强电车、矿车的检修和维护，并且整修了运输轨道和输电线路，为多拉快跑创造了良好条件。
    第四，在坑外运输方面，已经扩建了而且还将继续新建储矿仓和木溜子。烟筒山矿扩建的两个土储矿仓，6月底已有一个投入生产，加上原来的储矿仓，目前这个矿已经做到两天不来火车也能照常生产，两天不生产也能照常装车。庞家堡矿整修了原来的储矿仓，增加了防冻设备，但是还不够用，现在正筹集材料，准备新建一个土储矿仓。
    通过对运输系统的全面技术改造，这两个铁矿已经实现了坑内外运输机械化、半机械化，运输能力大大提高。今年6月份矿石产量比去年同期增加约13％，基本上做到了坑下采多少，运多少。运输效率的提高，为进一步增产矿石创造了极为有利的条件。进入7月份以来，职工们已经如火如荼地展开了一个万人大闹采矿方法革命的群众运动，努力增产矿石。仅庞家堡矿的职工，已经根据因地制宜的原则，提出了十多种新的采矿方法，这些方法经过鉴定、配套，初步总结成为八套较好的采矿方法，正在迅速推广。推行先进采矿方法的结果，庞家堡矿从6月份以来，月产矿石高达万吨以上的采矿队，已经由1月份的一个增加到六个。
