　　World Peace Council Standing Committee
　　Resolution on Cuba
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council condemns the repeated threats of aggression and acts of aggression by the United States government against Cuba, considering this a blatant violation of international law endangering world peace. The principles of non-interference and respect for national sovereignty, which are essential for peaceful coexistence, have been repeatedly undermined by the United States government in the Cuban issue. These actions violate the principles of the American Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's doctrine, and the basic tenets of American democracy.
    Since 1847, American imperialism has carried out more than forty armed aggressions against Latin American countries. Moreover, it has consistently supported dictatorships in Latin America and used economic and political pressure to prevent the peoples of Latin American countries from obtaining free self-determination. On the Cuban issue, it not only supported Batista's bloody and corrupt tyranny, but also attempted to thwart the revolutionary movement and prevent the enactment of laws beneficial to the people, such as the land reform law.
    The U.S. State Department is orchestrating an intense propaganda campaign against Cuba and protecting war criminals fleeing Cuba. At the same time, it is inciting the Dominican Republic and Guatemala—whose dictatorial governments serve the United States—to invade Cuba. Aircraft taking off from U.S. territory bomb Cuban plantations and factories. The U.S. government is trying to prevent Cuba from obtaining the weapons necessary to defend its sovereignty and is doing everything possible to undermine the firm support that the peoples of Latin American countries give to the Cuban government.
    All these conspiratorial actions of the U.S. government violate the wishes of the majority of American citizens who fully sympathize with the Cuban people's struggle for complete independence.
    The recent actions of U.S. imperialism against Cuba have taken the form of economic aggression and are intended to be carried out through the Organization of American States, which remains a tool of the U.S. State Department. It is attempting to prevent Cuba from obtaining oil, which has prompted the Cuban government to take legitimate measures against international monopolies—which are also cartels that exploit the American people and the peoples of other countries. The most recent act of aggression is the reduction of Cuba's sugar quota in the American market: a unilateral action without legal or moral basis.
    While taking these acts of economic aggression in violation of international agreements, some members of American society, including military personnel, are demanding armed intervention in Cuba. Such an act of aggression would not only be condemned by world public opinion but would also trigger a conflict of unforeseeable magnitude. The conversation between the U.S. President and the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers regarding the consequences of military action against Cuba has underscored this great danger.
    For all these reasons, the U.S. government's policy toward Cuba is a threat to the peoples of the Americas and the Cuban people. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council supports the Cuban government and its people's firm stance in defending their sovereignty, independence, and right to self-determination, and strongly condemns these acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism. It strongly supports the Cuban government's complaint to the United Nations Security Council regarding U.S. economic aggression.
    It calls on the peoples of all countries to stand in solidarity with Cuba and resist the pressure and threats of the U.S. imperialist bloc—which is the greatest threat to world peace today.

### 世界和平理事会常委会　关于古巴的决议

　　世界和平理事会常委会
　　关于古巴的决议
    世界和平理事会常务委员会谴责美国政府对古巴一再进行的侵略威胁和侵略行动，认为这是危及世界和平的明目张胆地违反国际法的行为。对和平共处是不可缺少的不干涉和尊重国家主权的原则，在古巴问题上一再遭到美国政府的破坏。这些行为违背了美国独立宣言的原则、林肯的学说和美国民主的基本教义。
    自从1847年以来，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲国家进行了四十多次武装侵略。不但如此，它还一贯支持拉丁美洲的独裁统治，并使用经济和政治压力阻止拉丁美洲各国人民得到自由的自决。在古巴问题上，它不仅支持巴蒂斯塔的血腥的、腐败的暴政，而且还力图挫败革命运动和阻止颁布有利于人民的法律、如土地改革法。
    美国国务院正在策划反对古巴的激烈的宣传运动，并保护逃离古巴的战犯。同时，它还怂恿多米尼加共和国和危地马拉——这两个国家的独裁政府为美国服务——侵犯古巴。从美国领土上起飞的飞机轰炸古巴的种植园和工厂。美国政府力图阻止古巴得到为保卫其主权所必要的武器，并千方百计地破坏拉丁美洲各国人民给予古巴政府的坚定的支持。
    美国政府的所有这些阴谋行动违背了完全同情古巴人民争取完全独立的大多数美国公民的愿望。
    美帝国主义最近反对古巴的行动是采取经济侵略和打算利用美洲国家组织的形式进行的，美洲国家组织仍然是美国国务院的工具。它企图不让古巴得到石油，这样就促使古巴政府对国际垄断资本——它们也就是那些剥削美国人民和其它国家人民的卡特尔——采取了正当的措施。最近的侵略行动是减少美国市场上的古巴食糖份额：这是没有法律或者道义根据的片面行动。
    在采取这些违反国际协定的经济侵略行动的同时，美国的某些社会人士，其中包括军人，要求对古巴进行武装干涉。这种侵略行动不仅将受到世界舆论的谴责，而且还将引起无法预见的规模的冲突。美国总统和苏联部长会议主席关于对古巴进行军事行动的后果的谈话已经着重表明了这种巨大的危险。
    由于这一切原因，美国政府对古巴的政策是对美洲人民以及古巴人民的威胁。世界和平理事会常务委员会支持古巴政府及其人民保卫他们的主权、独立和自决权的坚定态度，并强有力地谴责美帝国主义的这些侵略行动。它有力地支持古巴政府就美国的经济侵略向联合国安全理事会提出的控诉。
    它号召各国人民同古巴团结一致，抵抗美帝国主义集团的压力和威胁——这种压力和威胁是今天对世界和平的最大的威胁。
