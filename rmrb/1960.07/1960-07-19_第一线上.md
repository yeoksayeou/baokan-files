    The First Line
　　Yan Guojun, First Secretary of the CPC Jiaohe County Committee, Hebei Province
　　June 28
    The pattering rain woke me up. I jumped out of bed and looked at the clock, it was exactly 3:30 in the morning. The summer dawn comes so early, the sky was milky white, and the rain fell in fine lines. Ah! The people's two hundred days of battle had finally forced "Heaven" to concede, probably because it thought it really couldn't hold out any longer without raining. A gust of cool wind mixed with drizzle blew in my face, and I felt refreshed and invigorated. I decided to immediately ask about the rainfall situation in each commune.
    After calling all twenty-three communes in the county, it was already dawn, and most areas had received a thorough soaking. People's moods were the same: excitement, joy, renewed energy, and increased measures, determined to seize this crucial moment to win a bumper harvest for the whole year and go all out.
    The rain, though soaking, does not mean the end of the drought resistance struggle, because the purpose of drought resistance is to win a bumper harvest for the whole year. As long as the crops are not harvested, drought resistance will not stop for a day, so we must continue to advance victoriously and pay special attention to preventing possible new complacency and slackening. Therefore, the county party committee decided that the current central task is to seize the time to complete the sowing of summer crops. In order to do this work well, the secretary and the county committee members led all the cadres, together with the county party committee office, to move to the front line of production, to the most difficult places, and to engage in production labor with the commune members, leading production in production. I and five comrades from the county party committee office came to Dongguang Commune. The summer production battle headquarters is located here.
            June 29
    I went to the seventh management district of Dongguang Commune. This place is relatively poor, the land is saline-alkali and thin, and several sowings each year fail to produce seedlings. In recent years, it has gradually changed, especially since the full-scale launch of the movement for poor teams to catch up with rich teams and rich teams to help poor teams this year, leadership has been particularly strengthened in this area, and great assistance has been given in all aspects. Walking on the road, I noticed that the phenomenon of seedlings dying in patches in the fields was very serious. There were also fewer people working in the fields than in other places, many wheat stubble fields had not been ploughed and harrowed, and piles of fertilizer were piled on the edges of the fields and had not been spread. How to sow the seeds? If there are no lush green seedlings in the fields now, it will be impossible to strive for a full-year harvest. After talking with the commune members, the opinions were different. Most of them were encouraged by this year's unprecedented bumper wheat harvest, but some commune members said anxiously about the inability to grow seedlings: "It's really impossible to do anything with this kind of unlucky land."
    When I arrived at the management district's residence, the cadres of each production team were holding a meeting, and their mood was the same as that of the commune members. Using the facts of this year's wheat, I emphasized the principle that the harvest depends on people, not on Heaven, that the poor must have ambition, strive for self-improvement, and persist in continuous revolution. After listening, their confidence was higher and their energy was greater. It seems that ideological work must be done anytime, anywhere, and always, and it must be done before starting each task.
    Backward areas are the key areas for work. In the afternoon, I moved all the dozen or so comrades from the county work group here, cadres contracting small teams, eating, living, and working with the commune members. Several particularly backward production teams were completely handed over to the several county factories stationed in Dongguang, to be contracted by them for a long time, until they completely changed their appearance. Factory-team pairing, both sides are very satisfied. The most urgent thing at the moment is to sow the seeds well, and three tractors were also transferred from this commune and other communes to help them rush to sow.
            June 30
    In the afternoon, I went to the Sanlizhuang production team to work. This team is a production team that has just changed from poor to rich. Entering the village, everywhere is a scene of new life, full of joy. Branch Secretary Zhang Qingyi saw us coming and hurried over to greet us. I said, "I'm here to work for you, please assign me!"
    We went to weed together.
    Crossing the Leap Forward Canal, the fields of green crops were more than half a person tall, like a green sea.
  "How is this year's crop looking compared to previous years, with such a drought?" I asked. Qingyi looked at me, pointed to the endless green sea, waved his hand, and said, "We didn't care about that. Look, the water from the big river is all drawn out like a chicken intestine, and we also dug earthen wells, big wells... No matter what, we didn't let the crops suffer. Right now, the commune members are very motivated to work when they see such good seedlings. Our village's attendance rate has reached 115%..." "What's the 15%?" I interrupted and asked. He said, "All the old people over sixty years old are also participating in production, threshing wheat, planting vegetable gardens... they are very active!"
    After implementing square field planting, turning small mu into large squares, the field ends are very long. After hoeing two rows, the sun had already set, and I decided to return to the village earlier to take a look at their canteen.
    This is a better canteen, but there are also problems. One is that the reform of cooking utensils is not good, which takes up more labor. The canteen for more than 400 people occupies nine cooks. If the reform of cooking utensils is done well, five people can handle these things very well. Second, the canteen space is too narrow, and it is difficult for commune members to move around here. There is no dining hall yet, and the commune members all take their meals home, which is very inconvenient. Third, there are still fewer vegetables. The two canteens only have more than 20 mu of vegetable gardens. Our opinion is that each canteen should have no less than 30 mu of vegetable gardens. In addition, plant some vegetables on idle land so that commune members can eat enough fresh vegetables every day, both to adjust their lives and to save grain. The comrades of the production team also felt that there were indeed such major problems. Grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and never neglect either.
            July 2
    The comprehensive summer production movement has begun, and we must seize the time to write a work plan for the next step.
    The summer production task is arduous and heavy, and brooks no delay. Here, I suddenly thought of a passage that Chairman Mao talked about regarding working methods: "Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of the boat, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of methods, the task can only be talked about blindly." After these few days, I have a deeper understanding of this passage. Going to the front line and going to the most difficult places are all to solve the problem of "crossing the river." Last year, I explored some relatively effective experiences in leading agricultural production. For example, the method of inviting old farmers to be consultants, which was tried out in Qincun Commune, and the working method of cadres contracting small teams, which was tried out in Chezhi Commune, etc., have gradually been promoted throughout the county. After promoting the "two-five system" working experience this year, I have been thinking day and night about two other issues: one is how to train cadres on the basis of promoting the "two-five system" working method, and the other is how to improve the leadership methods of various levels below the commune. The day before yesterday, when I was in Qincun Commune, listening to the reports of the commune secretaries, they talked about the secretary taking the lead and using the method of large-scale operations to eliminate more than 10,000 mu of weedy land in three days. I pointed out at the time that this method is adapted to the current situation of large-scale production and is also the working method of combining the general and the individual and combining leadership and the masses that Chairman Mao often taught.

    第一线上
　　中共河北交河县委第一书记　阎国钧
　　6月28日
    淅淅沥沥的雨声，把我惊醒。我一骨碌爬了起来，看看表正是早晨三点半钟。夏季的黎明来得好早，天空呈现着乳白色，滴滴如线的雨点，爽爽而下。啊！人们二百天的战斗终于逼得“老天”交了权，大概它也以为再不下雨实在不行了。一阵凉风夹着细雨，迎面吹来，顿觉心清神怡。我决定马上问一下各公社的雨情。
    和全县二十三个公社通了一次电话，天已大亮，大部地区已降了透雨。人们的心情都是一样的：兴奋，喜悦，再添干劲，再加措施，决心抓住当前这个夺取全年大丰收的关键时刻，大干一场。
    雨，下透了，并不意味着抗旱斗争的结束，因为抗旱的目的是为了夺取全年大丰收。庄稼一日不收，抗旱一日不止，所以要继续乘胜前进，必须特别注意防止可能产生的新的麻痹思想和松懈情绪。于是县委决定当前的中心任务是抢时完成夏季农作物的播种工作。为了作好这项工作，书记和县委们带领全体干部连同县委办公室一并搬到生产第一线上去，到最困难的地方去，和社员们一道生产劳动，在生产中领导生产。我和县委办公室的五个同志来到东光公社。夏季生产战斗指挥部就安在这里。
            6月29日
    我往东光公社的第七管理区去。这里比较穷，土地盐碱脊薄，每年耩种几次都拿不上苗子。近几年渐渐改变，尤其是今年全面展开穷队赶富队和富队帮穷队的运动以来，对这个地区特别加强了领导，从各方面给了大力的援助。在路上走着，我注意了田间的苗子，成垅成片枯死的现象很重。在地里干活的人也不如别处多，许多麦茬地还没有耕耙，一堆堆肥料堆在地头还未撒开。怎么下种呢？如今地里要没有绿葱葱的苗子，全年的丰收就无法争取。经和社员们交谈，说法也不一样。他们多数为今年小麦获得空前的丰收而鼓舞，也有的社员对拿不住苗子急的说：“碰见这种倒霉地，真是有法没处施展去。”
    到了管理区驻地，各生产队的干部们正在开会，他们中间的情绪和社员们是一个样子。我用今年小麦的事实，着重讲了丰收在人不在天的道理，穷要有志气，要奋发图强，坚持不断革命。他们听了，信心又高了，劲头也大了。看来思想工作要随时随地作，经常的作，每项工作动手之前一定要作。
    落后地区是工作的重点地区。下午，把县工作组的十几个同志全搬到了这里来，干部包小队，与社员们同吃、同住、同劳动。有几个特别落后的生产队，就完全交给了驻东光的几个县工厂，由他们长期的包下来，一直到它完全改变面貌。厂队挂钩，双方都很满意。当前最紧要的事情，就是要播好种，又从他本社和外社给他们调来了三台拖拉机，帮助他们抢种。
            6月30日
    下午，我到三里庄生产队去劳动。这个队是一个刚刚由穷变富的生产队。一进村，处处一片新生气象，喜气洋洋。支部书记张清义见我们来了，赶紧跑来打招呼。我说：“我给你们干活来啦，请分配吧！”
    我们一块儿去锄地。
    穿过跃进渠，遍野碧绿的庄稼，都长了半人多高，就像一片绿海，
  “今年的庄稼比往年的成色怎么样啊，天气这么旱！”我问，清义看了看我，指了指这一眼看不见边的绿海，一挥手，说：“我们没管那个，你看，大河的水全抽的像个鸡肠子似的了，又打了土井、大井……。无论怎样，也没叫庄稼吃了亏。眼下，社员们见到这样的好苗子，干活积极性可高啦，我们全村的出勤率达到了115％……”“那十五是怎么回事？”我插问了一句。他说：“六十岁以上的老人也全参加了生产，轧麦子、种菜园子……积极得很！”
    实行方田种植以后，小亩化大方，地头很长，锄了两遭地，日已西沉，我决计早一点回村，看一看他们的食堂。
    这里是一个较好的食堂，不过，也有问题，一个是炊具改革不行，占得劳力多一些，四百多人的食堂占了九个炊事员，如要搞好炊具改革，有五个人就能把这些事情办得很好。二是食堂地方太窄，社员在这儿活动有困难，还没有饭厅，社员们全是打回家去吃饭，很不方便。三，蔬菜还少了一些，两个食堂，才二十多亩菜园，我们意见是每个食堂最低不少于三十亩菜园子。此外，再在闲散地上种些蔬菜，以使社员们每天都能吃到足够的鲜菜，又调剂生活，又节约粮食。生产队的同志们也感到确乎具有这样几个主要问题。一手抓生产，一手抓生活，绝不可偏废。
            7月2日
    全面的夏季生产运动这就开始了，必须抓紧时间，写出一个下一步的工作计划。
    夏季生产任务艰巨繁重，刻不容缓。在这里，我忽然想到毛主席谈过的关于工作方法的一段话：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法的问题，任务也只能瞎说一顿。”转了这几天，对这段话体会更加深刻了。到第一线去，到最困难的地方去，都是解决“过河”的问题。去年，在领导农业生产的工作上摸索出了一些比较有效的经验。例如在秦村公社试行的请老农当顾问的办法，在车志公社试行的干部包小队的工作方法，等等，这些都逐渐推广到了全县。今年在推行“二五制”的工作经验以后，我日夜考虑着还有两个问题，一是如何在推行“二五制”工作方法的基础上培养干部的问题，二是如何改进公社以下各级的领导方法问题。前天，在秦村公社的时候，听公社书记们汇报，他们谈到了书记挂帅，用大兵团作战的方法，突击三天，消灭了一万多亩草荒地，我当时指出，这个方法适应目前大生产的形势，也是毛主席经常教导的一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合的工作方法。
