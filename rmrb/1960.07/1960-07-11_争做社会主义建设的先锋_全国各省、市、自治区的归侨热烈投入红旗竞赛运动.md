Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: A Red Flag emulation campaign of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the less advanced" has successively unfolded among returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students in twenty provinces, cities, and autonomous regions throughout the country.

Through this emulation campaign, the political consciousness of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students has rapidly increased, and advanced elements have continuously emerged. In Beijing this year, the number of returned overseas Chinese who attended the city and national hero conferences in the first half of the year was twenty-five, an increase of one and a half times compared to the entire year of last year. Zheng Jinde, a returned overseas Chinese from the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory, innovated two tools, increasing work efficiency by four to five times, and was named an "Excellent Ten-Good" advanced producer. Huang Chunhai, an outstanding salesperson and returned overseas Chinese from Sanmenxia City, is proficient in his work, familiar with the performance of more than 5,000 commodities, and is kind and patient with customers, receiving more than 4,000 written letters of praise in the past six months. There are even more advanced figures among returned overseas Chinese and their families on the agricultural front. In Minhou County, Fujian Province, more than 20,000 families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, together with the people of the county, are developing Wanbao Mountain. The "Seven Fairies Team" of Xu Yixue, a family member of overseas Chinese, and the "Eight Sisters Team" of Li Baoyu challenged each other and both completed their afforestation tasks ahead of schedule with over-fulfilled quotas. Among the seventy-six afforestation pacesetters selected by the Xujia Village Brigade, returned overseas Chinese and their families accounted for fifty-two.

In the past six months, returned overseas Chinese students have also made rapid progress. For example, among the 228 returned overseas Chinese students at Peking University, Beijing Normal College, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital Nursing School, 191 had excellent grades in examinations, accounting for 84%. Among the 34 returned overseas Chinese students at the University of Science and Technology of China, 13 have been commended for their excellent performance in carrying out scientific research work. In Shijiazhuang, the proportion of returned overseas Chinese students with excellent grades has increased from 55% last year to 75% this year.

Returned overseas Chinese who were persecuted in Indonesia and brought back by ships sent by the motherland have also enthusiastically engaged in labor emulation. Recently, 139 new returned overseas Chinese at the Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangdong Province were rated as "upstream," and 47 were rated as activists. More than 200 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, who had just settled in the Hong Wuyue Farm in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province in May, automatically formed a team to support the farm's basic construction. More than 1,000 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who settled in the Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangxi launched a labor emulation drive and carried out technical innovations, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and non-staple foods as soon as possible.

On the basis of the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students, more and more of them are requesting to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. In the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory and the Beijing Chemical Factory, the number of Party and League members among returned overseas Chinese workers has increased from 36 last year to 99 this year.

In order to help returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students make even greater leaps forward, a national "Returned Overseas Chinese, Families, and Returned Overseas Chinese Students Red Flag Emulation Promotion Committee" has recently been established.

　　争做社会主义建设的先锋
　　全国各省、市、自治区的归侨热烈投入红旗竞赛运动
    新华社10日讯　一个“学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进”的红旗竞赛运动，已经在全国二十个省、市、自治区的归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生中先后展开。
    通过这一竞赛运动，归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生的政治觉悟迅速提高，先进分子不断增加。北京市今年上半年出席全市和全国群英会的归侨有二十五名，比去年全年出席全市和全国群英会的归侨增加一倍半。南京第二机床厂归侨郑进德，革新两项工具，提高工效四至五倍，被评为“十好”先进生产者。三门峡市优秀营业员、归侨黄春海，精通业务，熟悉五千多种商品的性能，对顾客和蔼耐心，半年来收到书面表扬信四千多件。农业战线上归侨、侨眷的先进人物更加众多。福建省闽侯县二万多名侨眷、归侨同全县人民一起开发万宝山，侨眷徐依雪的“七仙女队”和李宝玉的“八姐妹队”，互相挑战，都提前超额完成开荒造林任务。徐家村大队评选的七十六名开荒造林标兵中，归侨、侨眷占五十二人。
    半年来归侨学生也在迅速进步。如北京大学、北京师范学院、中苏友谊医院护士学校的二百二十八个归侨学生，考试成绩优良的有一百九十一人，占总数84％。中国科学技术大学的三十四名归侨学生，在开展科学研究工作中成绩优良受到表扬的有十三人。石家庄市归侨学生成绩优良的比例，由去年的55％上升到今年的75％。
    在印度尼西亚受迫害由祖国派船接运回来的归侨也热情地投入了劳动竞赛。广东省陆丰华侨农场最近有一百三十九名新归侨被评为“上游”，四十七名评为积极分子。5月份才到广东省两阳县红五月农场安家的二百多名印度尼西亚归侨，到场后就自动组成支援农场基本建设的队伍。在广西武鸣华侨农场安家的一千多名印度尼西亚归侨，开展了劳动竞赛，大搞技术革新，争取尽速做到粮食和副食品自给。
    在归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生社会主义觉悟不断提高的基础上，他们中越来越多的人要求加入共产党、共青团。北京电子管厂和北京化工厂，归侨职工中，去年有党、团员三十六人，今年已增加到九十九人。
    为了帮助归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生更好地跃进，一个全国性的“归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生红旗竞赛促进委员会”已经在最近成立。
