Xinhua News Agency, July 14th. Iraqi Ambassador to China, Fadil, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the National Day of the Republic of Iraq. In his speech at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Chinese people and the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries will forever support each other and cooperate closely in the common struggle against imperialism."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Chinese Government and the Chinese people resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle against interference by U.S. imperialism, resolutely support the Algerian people's national liberation war, resolutely support the Congolese people's struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose imperialist military suppression, and resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty and against U.S. military bases."

This evening, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo and Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, and Vice Chairman Li Siguang of the National Committee of the CPPCC all attended the reception.

The reception, held at the Beijing Hotel, began at 6:30 PM. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of the Republic of Iraq. He said: "The revolution in Iraq and the birth of the Republic of Iraq have opened a new page in Iraqi history, enabling the Iraqi people to embark on the road of independent development. The victory of the Iraqi people caused the ‘Baghdad Pact Group’ to disintegrate, and dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist aggression line and war plans in the Middle East. The ‘Central Treaty Organization,’ which U.S. imperialism cobbled together on the ruins of the ‘Baghdad Pact Group,’ is also in a precarious state due to the rise of the Turkish people's patriotic and just struggle and the overthrow of the Menderes regime. All this shows that the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism and its military blocs are against the will of the people and are therefore very weak; under the counterattack of the increasingly awakened people of the world, U.S. imperialism's war policy and aggression policy can be defeated."

He said: "U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its failure, nor has it learned the lessons it should have learned from these failures. Recently, after disrupting the ten-nation disarmament conference, U.S. imperialism once again sent an RB-47 military aircraft to invade Soviet airspace for espionage activities, and once again received the punishment it deserved. U.S. imperialism also openly conducted rocket and atomic mock bomb shooting exercises in South Korea, and massively increased the number of U.S. 'Military Aid Advisory Group' personnel in South Vietnam, stepping up war preparations. These facts show that U.S. imperialism's provocations and sabotage activities against the socialist camp have not stopped in the slightest. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the Soviet government's protests to the U.S. government and the governments of relevant countries that provide bases for U.S. aircraft, and resolutely support the just struggles of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Accords."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "While infringing upon socialist countries, U.S. imperialism is also intensifying its brutal interference in the Cuban people who are defending national independence, attempting to launch new military adventures. U.S. imperialism has always supported the French imperialists' criminal war in Algeria. Recently, U.S. imperialism is plotting and even preparing to personally carry out armed intervention against the Congolese people who have just won independence. However, all this can only further arouse the righteous indignation of the Cuban, Algerian, Congolese, and all oppressed people, making them more united and resolutely struggle against U.S. imperialism."

He emphasized: "The reason why U.S. imperialism dares to provoke and invade the socialist camp and the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries is because they have misjudged the situation. U.S. imperialism has been painstakingly trying to undermine the fraternal friendship among the socialist countries and provoke the friendly relations between socialist countries and Asian and African countries. Now, it mistakenly believes that its sinister plan has succeeded, and it seems that it can carry out new adventures. However, the facts are always contrary to the subjective wishes of imperialism. The great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, is unbreakable. Any imperialist infringement on any socialist country will be met with a devastating counterattack from the entire socialist camp. The friendly relations between socialist countries and Asian, African, and Latin American countries are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have been established and developed in the common struggle against imperialism. Although there are still some local and temporary problems between our country and some Asian countries, as long as both sides conduct friendly consultations in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual concession, these problems can be reasonably resolved." He said, "We believe that in the excellent situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, if U.S. imperialism dares to defy the world and carry out military adventures, it will certainly accelerate its own demise."

He pointed out: "The Chinese government and people have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and have made unremitting efforts and well-known contributions to this end. However, the imperialist countries headed by the United States are unwilling to truly coexist peacefully with socialist countries. They have adopted a series of policies, politically, economically, and militarily, that are hostile to socialist countries. The facts of the past fifteen years since the war have clearly demonstrated who advocates peaceful coexistence and who opposes peaceful coexistence. At the same time, it fully shows that in order to achieve peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and imperialist countries, it is not enough to rely solely on negotiations with imperialism, but it is necessary to mainly rely on the struggle of the people of the world. We are pleased to see that now the strength of the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong, the strength of the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the strength of the struggles of the people of Western countries including the United States, and the strength of all peace-loving forces in the world have all developed rapidly. As long as these forces further unite, persist in unremittingly carrying out a long-term struggle against U.S. imperialism's war policy and aggression policy, and firmly grasp peace in their own hands, it is possible to force the imperialist countries headed by the United States to retreat in the face of difficulties and have to accept the situation of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems to varying degrees."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The people of China and Iraq have a long-standing traditional friendship. After the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the inherent friendly relations between our two peoples have been newly developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit." He said: "Further developing the economic and cultural relations between the two countries and strengthening the friendly unity between the two peoples not only fully conforms to the common aspirations and interests of the Chinese and Iraqi peoples, but also benefits the lofty cause of the Asian and African peoples in striving for and safeguarding national independence and defending world peace." He finally wished the friendly relations between China and Iraq further development and consolidation, and wished the friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi peoples everlasting.

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was received with extremely warm applause.

Iraqi Ambassador to China, Fadil, spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said: "I am very pleased that our embassy is celebrating the Iraqi revolutionary festival for the first time in this liberated and friendly country." He believed that "the Iraqi people have never been so jubilant throughout their history as they were on July 14, 1958."

After praising Prime Minister Qasim, the ambassador described the disasters suffered by the Iraqi people in the past. He said that the land of Iraq has the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, oil resources, and various minerals, and is one of the richest lands in the world, but the Iraqi people living on this land are among the poorest people in the world. The ambassador also said: "The Iraqi people, who invented writing six thousand years ago and thus contributed to the people of the world, are illiterate today. Few people can write the words 'July 14,' which are engraved in the hearts of every Iraqi people with light and fire. This is the result of foreign rule and the corrupt governments of the past, who, for the sake of a few, did not hesitate to sell out their country and make the people suffer poverty. However, since July 14, 1958, all this has been gone forever."

The ambassador said that the task of the Iraqi revolution is to "create a beautiful life of progress and prosperity for the masses of the people that is in line with their natural wealth, environment, and conditions." "In the past two years alone, the revolutionary government has implemented many practical plans, including multiplying the number of students in schools at all levels, especially primary schools, sending more students to study abroad, establishing many factories throughout the country, allocating land, and digging irrigation canals. The government has formulated a four-year temporary plan with an appropriation of 400 million Iraqi dinars to complete the production plans urgently needed for a prosperous life. Then, a long-term plan for a period of ten years will be implemented, in which heavy industries and large enterprises will be established and Iraq's industrialization will be completed."

He said: "All this will be relying on the people and for the benefit of the people."

The ambassador said that Iraq's foreign policy "is a policy of close cooperation and solidarity with fraternal Arab countries, friendship with all peoples, and defending the cause of peace and all just causes internationally."

The ambassador said: "Today, the second anniversary of the Iraqi revolution is also the anniversary of the birth of Iraqi-Chinese friendship. On this day, for the first time in centuries, the Iraqi people are able to extend a hand of friendship and cooperation to all peace-loving peoples, including the great Chinese people. On this day, the great Chinese people announced to the world their friendship and support for the revolutionary Iraqi people. Every Iraqi people today and will always remember this with deep gratitude. In the past two years, the friendship between our two countries has greatly developed, which is not only reflected in the exchange of diplomatic envoys and mutual support in international politics, but also in practical cooperation in economic and cultural fields. Cultural agreements and trade agreements have been signed between the two countries, and delegations have been sent to visit each other."

The ambassador finally warmly congratulated the growing and eternal friendship between Iraq and China, and wished for the solidarity of the Asian and African people.

At the end of the speeches by Ambassador Fadil and Vice Premier Chen Yi, the band played the national anthems of China and Iraq respectively.

Also attending the reception this evening were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association Liu Ningyi, heads of various departments of state organs and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital. Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the reception.

　　陈毅副总理在庆祝伊拉克国庆的招待会上说
　　中国同亚非拉丁美洲人民在反帝斗争中永远互相支持
　　坚决支持古巴人民、阿尔及利亚人民、刚果人民、日本人民的正义斗争
    新华社14日讯　伊拉克驻中国大使法迪尔今天晚间举行盛大招待会，庆祝伊拉克共和国国庆日。陈毅副总理在招待会上的讲话中说：“中国人民同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，将永远互相支持，密切合作。”
    陈毅副总理说：“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，坚决支持刚果人民维护民族独立、反对帝国主义军事镇压的斗争，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事条约、反对美国军事基地的斗争。”
    今晚，董必武副主席，郭沫若、陈叔通副委员长，习仲勋副总理，政协全国委员会李四光副主席等都出席了招待会。
    在北京饭店举行的这个招待会在六时半开始。陈毅副总理在讲话中，代表中国政府和人民向伊拉克共和国政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。他说：“伊拉克的革命和伊拉克共和国的诞生，给伊拉克的历史揭开了新的一页，使伊拉克人民从此走上独立发展的道路。伊拉克人民的胜利，使
  ‘巴格达条约集团’陷于瓦解，使美帝国主义在中东的侵略阵线和战争计划遭到沉重的打击。美帝国主义在‘巴格达条约集团’废墟上重新拼凑起来的‘中央条约组织’，由于土耳其人民爱国正义斗争的兴起和曼德列斯政权的被推翻，也正处在风雨飘摇之中。这一切说明，貌似强大的美帝国主义和它所拼凑的军事集团是违背人心的、因而也是非常虚弱的；在日益觉醒的世界各国人民的反击之下，美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策是可以被打败的。”
    他说：“美帝国主义并不甘于自己的失败，也没有从这些失败中得到应有的教训。最近，美帝国主义在破坏了十国裁军会议之后，又一次派遣RB—47型军用飞机侵犯苏联领空，进行间谍活动，并且又一次受到了应有的惩罚。美帝国主义还公然在南朝鲜进行火箭和原子模拟弹的射击演习，在南越大量增加美国‘军事援助顾问团’人员，加紧备战活动。这些事实说明，美帝国主义对社会主义阵营的挑衅和破坏活动丝毫没有停止。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府向美国政府和为美国飞机提供基地的有关国家政府所提出的抗议，坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国反对美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定和日内瓦协议的正义斗争。”
    陈毅副总理说：“在侵犯社会主义国家的同时，美帝国主义还在加紧对维护民族独立的古巴人民进行横暴的干涉，企图发动新的军事冒险。美帝国主义一直支持法国帝国主义者在阿尔及利亚进行的罪恶战争。最近，美帝国主义正阴谋策划甚至准备亲自出马对刚刚赢得独立的刚果人民进行武装干涉。但是，所有这些只能更加激起古巴、阿尔及利亚、刚果和一切被压迫人民的义愤，使他们更加团结起来，同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。”
    他强调指出：“美帝国主义所以敢于向社会主义阵营和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民进行挑衅和侵略，是由于它们错误地估计了形势。美帝国主义一直在处心积虑地破坏社会主义阵营各国的兄弟友谊，挑拨社会主义国家和亚非国家之间的友好关系。
　　现在，它误认为自己的这种奸计已经得逞，似乎又可以进行新的冒险了。但是，事实总是和帝国主义的主观愿望相违背的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营建筑在马克思列宁主义基础之上的伟大团结是牢不可破的。帝国主义对任何一个社会主义国家的侵犯都将遭到整个社会主义阵营毁灭性的还击。社会主义国家和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家之间的友好关系，是以和平共处五项原则为基础的，并且是在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中建立和发展起来的。尽管我国同某些亚洲国家之间，还存在着一些局部性和暂时性的问题，但是，只要双方本着互谅互让的精神，进行友好协商，这些问题都是可以得到合理解决的。”他说：“我们相信在东风压倒西风的大好形势下，如果美帝国主义敢于冒天下之大不韪，进行军事冒险，它就一定会加速自己的灭亡。”
    他指出：“中国政府和人民历来主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且为此进行了不懈的努力，作出了众所周知的贡献。但是以美国为首的帝国主义国家是不愿意同社会主义国家真正和平共处的。它们在政治上、经济上、军事上采取了一系列同社会主义国家为敌的政策。战后十五年来的事实再清楚不过地说明了谁主张和平共处，谁反对和平共处。同时也充分说明了，要在社会主义国家同帝国主义国家之间实现和平共处，仅仅依靠同帝国主义谈判是办不到的，而必须主要依靠全世界人民的斗争。我们高兴地看到，现在社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的力量、西方国家包括美国人民斗争的力量，和全世界一切爱好和平的力量都有了迅速的发展。只要这些力量进一步团结起来，坚持不懈地同美帝国主义的战争政策、侵略政策进行长期的斗争，并且把和平紧紧地掌握在自己手中，就有可能迫使以美国为首的帝国主义国家知难而退，不得不在不同程度上接受不同社会制度的国家间的和平共处局面。”
    陈毅副总理说：“中、伊两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。伊拉克共和国成立后，我们两国人民之间固有的友好关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上得到了新的发展。”他说：“进一步发展两国的经济和文化关系，加强两国人民的友好团结，不仅完全符合于中、伊两国人民的共同愿望和利益，而且有利于亚非各国人民争取和维护民族独立以及保卫世界和平的崇高事业。”他最后祝中伊两国的友好关系进一步发展和巩固，祝中伊两国人民的友谊万古长青。
    陈毅副总理的讲话，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    伊拉克驻中国大使法迪尔在招待会开始时讲话。他说：“我国大使馆在这个解放了的友好国家首次庆祝伊拉克革命节日，我感到非常高兴。”他认为，“伊拉克人民在自己的整个历史过程中，从来没有过像1958年7月14日那样欢欣鼓舞。”
    大使在赞扬了卡塞姆总理以后，描述了伊拉克人民过去所遭受的灾难。他说，伊拉克土地上有幼发拉底和底格里斯两条河流，有石油资源和各种矿藏，是世界上最富饶的土地之一，但生活在这块土地上的伊拉克人民却是世界上最贫穷的人民之一。大使又说：“六千年前发明了文字从而对世界人民做出贡献的伊拉克人民，今天却是文盲。用光和火铭刻在每个伊拉克人民心坎上的‘7月14日’这几个字，就很少有人会写。这是外国统治和过去的腐朽政府造成的结果，腐朽政府为了少数几个人是不惜出卖祖国使全国人民遭受贫困的。但是，从1958年7月14日那天起，这一切都已经一去不复返了。”
    大使说，伊拉克革命的任务就是“为人民群众创造自己的自然财富，环境和条件相符合的进步繁荣的美好生活。”“革命政府仅在过去两年时间内，已经实现了许多实际计划，其中包括成倍地增长各级学校、尤其是小学的学生人数，增派留学生，在全国各地建立许多工厂，分配土地，挖掘灌溉渠等。政府制定了一个四年临时计划，拨款达四亿伊拉克底那尔，以完成为繁荣生活而迫切需要的生产计划。然后实行一个为期十年的长期计划，十年内建立重工业和大型企业，完成伊拉克的工业化。”
    他说：“这一切都将是依靠人民，为了人民的利益的。”
    大使说，伊拉克的外交政策“是同兄弟的阿拉伯国家紧密合作和团结，同一切人民友好，保卫和平事业和国际上一切正义事业的政策。”
    大使说：“伊拉克革命两周年的今天，同时也是伊中友好诞生两周年的纪念日。就在这一天，伊拉克人民若干世纪以来第一次能向包括伟大中国人民在内的爱好和平的各国人民，伸出友谊合作的手。就在这一天，伟大的中国人民向全世界宣告对革命的伊拉克人民的友好和支持。每个伊拉克人民今天而且将永远以深深感激的心情记住这件事。在过去两年中，我们两国之间的友谊已经有了很大的发展，这不仅表现在两国交换外交使节和在国际政治上的相互支持方面，而且表现在经济文化上的实际合作方面。两国之间签订了文化协定和贸易协定，并且互派代表团进行访问。”
    大使最后热烈祝贺伊拉克中国之间的日益增长的永恒友谊，并祝亚非人民的团结。
    在法迪尔大使和陈毅副总理讲话结束时，乐队分别奏中国和伊拉克两国的国歌。
    今晚出席招待会的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中国伊拉克友好协会会长刘宁一，国家机关各部门和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军，以及首都各方面的人士。各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。
