　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 24th. According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the Central Statistical Bureau of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers published a communique on the implementation of the national economic development plan for the first half of this year on the 23rd.

　　The communique stated that Bulgaria completed 102.2% of its total industrial output value plan for the first half of the year, and the total product value for the first six months of this year increased by 15% compared to last year.

　　The communique indicated that electricity generation in the first half of the year was 2.141 billion kilowatt-hours (an increase of 22% compared to the same period last year), coal production was 8,347,000 tons (an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year), iron was 55,000 tons (an increase of 3% compared to the same period last year), steel was 120,000 tons (an increase of 6% compared to the same period last year), steel materials were 98,000 tons (an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year), and cotton cloth was 108 million meters (an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year).

　　The communique stated that in agriculture, the sown area of ​​corn, barley, sugar beets, vegetables, potatoes, and silage feed crops has been expanded compared to last year. Agriculture has received 5,300 new tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) and over 1,000 combine harvesters. In the first half of this year, machine tractor stations cultivated 6.5 million decares more land than in the same period last year. The state's purchase of agricultural products has also greatly increased compared to last year.

　　The communique stated that capital construction investment in the first half of this year reached 2.993 billion leva, an increase of 33.9% compared to the same period last year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. Recently, a batch of the world's and Europe's largest industrial equipment has been fully or partially completed and put into production in the Soviet Union.

　　The world's largest continuous steel casting installation was put into production on July 11th at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory in Stalino. The entire production process of this steel casting installation is mechanized and automated, and it can turn molten metal into steel billets in a matter of minutes. It transforms 140 tons of molten metal into steel billets in just about an hour. According to engineers' calculations, putting this continuous steel casting installation into production can save the factory 10 million rubles each year.

　　The first phase of the world's largest hydraulic coal mine—the Yanovsky Hydraulic Coal Mine in the Lugansk Economic Zone—has recently been put into production half a year ahead of schedule. This first phase includes six working faces. In the level roadways of the coal seam, one cannot see the rails for coal cars; instead, there are coal conveying troughs. The extracted coal is transported out of the mine through the coal conveying troughs under the impact of a powerful stream of water. A hydraulic excavator operator can extract 200 to 300 tons of coal in one shift, which is equivalent to the output of a combined coal mining team of twelve workers in one shift. The entire production process of this coal mine, from mining to transporting the coal to the surface, is mechanized and automated.

　　The first phase of one of the world's largest cold rolling mills—the cold rolling mill of the Novolipetsk Steel Plant—was also put into production not long ago. This workshop covers an area of ​​12 hectares (15 mu per hectare). Its main equipment consists of two powerful automated "1200" type rolling mills. During rolling, the steel plate moves at a speed of up to 15 meters per second, or 50 kilometers per hour. The pressure of its rollers on the steel reaches 1,600 tons. The production process of this workshop is also fully automated. Once fully completed, it can produce tens of thousands of tons of high-quality rolled steel each year.

　　Europe's largest "1700" type sheet rolling mill was put into production at the Cherepovets Steel Plant at the end of June. It rolls thin sheets with a thickness of 1.8 mm to 8 mm. The entire operation of this machine is automated.

    保加利亚完成今年上半年生产计划
    苏联建成世界最大铸铁装置和水力煤矿
    新华社索非亚24日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚部长会议中央统计局23日公布了今年上半年国民经济发展计划执行情况公报。
    公报指出，保加利亚上半年工业总产值计划完成了102.2％，今年头六个月产品总值比去年增加15％。
    公报指出，上半年发电量为二十一亿四千一百万度（比去年同期增加22％），煤产量为八百三十四万七千吨（比去年同期增加13％），铁为五万五千吨（比去年同期增加3％），钢为十二万吨（比去年同期增加6％），钢材为九万八千吨（比去年同期增加18％），棉布为一亿零八百万米（比去年同期增加9％）。
    公报说，在农业方面玉蜀黍、大麦、甜菜、蔬菜、马铃薯和青贮饲料的作物播种面积比去年扩大了。农业获得了五千三百台新的拖拉机（以十五马力计算），一千多台收割联合机。今年上半年机器拖拉机站比去年同期多耕了六百五十万狄卡尔土地。国家收购的农产品也比去年大大增多。
    公报说，今年上半年基本建设投资达二十九亿九千三百万列弗，比去年同期多33.9％。
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联最近有一批世界和欧洲最大的工业设备全部或部分建成并投入生产。
    世界上最大的一座连续铸钢装置已经在7月11日在斯大林诺的斯大林冶金工厂投入生产。这座铸钢装置的全部生产过程都是机械化和自动化的，它在几分钟内就可以把熔液变成钢坯。它把一百四十吨的熔液变成钢坯，总共只需要一小时左右。据工程师们的计算，这座连续铸钢装置投入生产后，可以使工厂每年节约一千万卢布。
    世界上最大的水力煤矿——卢干斯克经济区雅诺夫斯基水力煤矿的第一期工程，已经在最近提前半年投入生产。这一期工程包括六个工作面。人们在采煤层的平巷中看不到供煤车行驶的铁轨，代替铁轨的是输煤槽。而开采出来的煤就在强大的水流冲击下，通过输煤槽被运出矿外。一个水力挖掘机手在一个工作班中可以采掘二百到三百吨煤，即等于由十二名工人组成的一个联合采煤机队在一个工作班中的开采量。这个煤矿从采掘到把煤运到地面的全部生产过程，都是机械化和自动化的。
    世界上最大的冷轧车间之一——新利佩茨克钢铁工厂的冷轧车间的第一期工程，也在不久前投入生产。这座车间占地十二公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），它的主要设备是两个强大的自动化的“1200”型轧钢机，压延时，钢板的移动速度每秒钟高达十五米，即每小时移动五十公里，它的轧辊对钢的压力达到一千六百吨。这个车间的生产过程也是完全自动化的，全部建成后每年可以生产几万吨优质的压延钢。
    欧洲最大的一台“1700”型薄板轧机6月底在切列波维茨钢铁工厂投入生产。它轧出的薄板的厚度为一点八毫米到八毫米。这个机器的全部操纵过程都是自动化的。
