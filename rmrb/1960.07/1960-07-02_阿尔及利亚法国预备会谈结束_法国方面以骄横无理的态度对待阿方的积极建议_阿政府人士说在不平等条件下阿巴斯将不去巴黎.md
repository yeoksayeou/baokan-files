Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 1st: The preparatory talks between representatives of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and representatives of the French government ended on June 29th.

The talks began on June 25th in Melun, France. The two sides held a total of four meetings over five days.

After the talks, both sides issued their own communiqués. The representative of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria said in a communiqué that the talks had ended and that the Algerian representatives "will immediately return to Tunis to report to the (Provisional) Government."

The French Prime Minister's Office issued a communiqué still slandering the Algerian representatives as "rebels." The communiqué said that "during the talks, the (French) government representatives explained the conditions for future possible negotiations to the envoys of the external organization of the Algerian rebels (referring to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria)." The communiqué said that future negotiations will be held in accordance with the suggestions put forward by French President de Gaulle, in order to achieve a "glorious end" to the fighting in Algeria, resolve the handling of arms, and ensure the fate of the combatants.

On June 20th, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria announced that it would send a delegation headed by Abbas to Paris to meet with French President de Gaulle. After this, the Provisional Government of Algeria sent a delegation headed by Boumendjel to hold preparatory talks with the French government delegation in Melun, near Paris.

During the negotiations, French newspapers reported that the French government was trying to limit the negotiations to military issues. At the same time, the Algerian representatives hoped to obtain guarantees for the honest exercise of self-determination by the Algerian people. "La Croix" wrote, "It seems that, on the French side, firstly, there is a firm insistence on the purely military nature of the negotiations, and secondly, an evasion of recognizing the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria." "Le Monde" pointed out that the French government's unwillingness to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, and the fact that the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Movement, Ben Bella and others, are still imprisoned in France, complicate the negotiations further.

Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, July 1st: Sources in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in Tunis said on June 30th that they were not responsible for the breakdown of contact with the French government. Under the conditions proposed by the French side to the envoys of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in Melun, their leader Abbas will not go to Paris.

According to Agence France-Presse, Algerian sources pointed out that "the last meeting in Melun was held in a tense atmosphere."

It was reported that Algerian Provisional Government sources pointed out, "In Melun, we asked who on the French side would receive the Abbas delegation. Our questions were evaded."

He said, "We asked if the Abbas mission would meet with de Gaulle. They told us: possibly, but only when all the conditions are met."

He said, "We asked if we could at least see a French minister. They told us: possibly, but the minister would be designated by them."

He said, "We asked if we could meet with Ben Bella and other imprisoned brothers? They replied: absolutely not, neither direct nor indirect meetings."

The Algerian Provisional Government source also said, "We told the representatives of the French government that we wanted to go to Paris as free people. We wanted to contact people other than those designated to negotiate with us or those allowed to bring us food. We were told: no."

According to reports, Tunisian newspapers on June 30th all published news about the Franco-Algerian preparatory talks on the front page.

The headline of "L'Action," the organ of the ruling Neo Destour party of Tunisia, said: "The French government is endangering the efforts to save peace by trying to turn the negotiations into a military surrender."

The headline of "Le Petit Matin" (the French-language newspaper of the Neo Destour party) was "Paris made no favorable response to the five questions raised by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria."

"Assabah" said, "The French representatives negatively answered the positive suggestions of the Algerian Provisional Government representatives with an 'uncompromising' attitude."

    阿尔及利亚法国预备会谈结束
    法国方面以骄横无理的态度对待阿方的积极建议
    阿政府人士说在不平等条件下阿巴斯将不去巴黎
    新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表同法国政府代表之间举行的预备性会谈已经在6月29日结束。
    双方的这次会谈是从6月25日起在法国的默伦举行的。五天中双方共举行了四次会谈。
    会谈结束后双方分别发表了自己的公报。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表在公报中说，双方的会谈已经结束，阿尔及利亚代表“将立即返回突尼斯向（共和国临时）政府提出报告”。
    法国政府总理办公厅发表的公报仍然诬蔑阿尔及利亚代表为“叛乱分子”。公报说，“在会谈过程中，（法国）政府代表向阿尔及利亚叛乱分子的外部组织（即指阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府）的使者们说明了今后可能举行谈判的条件”。公报说什么今后的谈判将按照法国总统戴高乐提出的建议举行，以便使阿尔及利亚的战斗得到“光荣的结束、解决军火的处理问题并保证战斗人员的命运”。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在6月20日宣布它将派遣一个以阿巴斯为首的代表团前往巴黎同法国总统戴高乐会晤。在这以后，阿尔及利亚临时政府派遣了以布曼杰尔为首的代表团同法国政府代表团在巴黎附近的默伦举行预备性会谈。
    法国报纸在谈判期间传出这样的消息，法国政府试图使这次谈判只讨论军事问题。同时阿尔及利亚代表希望得到忠诚行使阿尔及利亚人的自决权的保证。“十字架报”写道，“看来，法国方面，第一是坚决坚持谈判的纯军事性质，第二，回避承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府”。“世界报”指出，法国政府不希望承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，以及阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的领导人本·贝拉和其他人迄今被监禁在法国，这些情况使谈判更复杂起来。
    新华社1日讯　突尼斯消息：在突尼斯的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府人士6月30日说，他们不负同法国政府的接触破裂的责任。在法国方面在默伦向阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府使者所提出的条件下，他们的领袖阿巴斯将不前往巴黎。
    据法新社报道，阿尔及利亚人士指出，“在默伦的最后一次会谈是在紧张的气氛中举行的。”
    据报道，阿尔及利亚临时政府人士指出，“在默伦，我们问，在法国方面谁将接待阿巴斯代表团。人们对我们的问题避而不答。”
    他说，“我们问阿巴斯使团是否将会晤戴高乐。他们告诉我们：可能，但是在一切条件都具备的时候。”
    他说，“我们问是否将至少见到一位法国部长。他们对我们说：可能，但是这位部长将由他们指定。”
    他说，“我们问是否可以会晤本·贝拉以及其他被监禁的兄弟们？他们答复我们说：绝对不成，无论是直接的或者是间接会晤都不行。”
    这位阿尔及利亚临时政府的人士还说，“我们对法国政府的代表们说，我们希望作为自由的人前往巴黎。我们希望除了那些被指定同我们谈判的那些人或者准许送食物给我们的人之外，同另外一些人接触。我们被告诉说：不行。”
    据报道，突尼斯各报6月30日纷纷在第一版上刊登了有关法阿预备谈判的消息。
    突尼斯执政的新宪政党机关报“行动报”的标题说：“法国政府用试图把谈判转变为军事投降的方法，来危害拯救和平的努力。”
      “拂晓报”（新宪政党的法文报纸）的标题是“巴黎没有对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府提出的五个问题，作任何有利的答复。”
    “晨报”说，“法国代表用‘不妥协’的态度否定地答复了阿尔及利亚临时政府代表的积极建议。”
