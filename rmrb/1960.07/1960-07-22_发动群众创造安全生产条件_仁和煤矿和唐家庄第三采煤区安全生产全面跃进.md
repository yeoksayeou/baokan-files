    Mobilizing the Masses to Create Safe Production Conditions
    Renhe Coal Mine and Tangjiazhuang No. 3 Mining Area Achieve Overall Leap Forward in Safe Production

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: The Renhe Coal Mine in Daguan County, Yunnan Province, has not had a major accident in the ten years since liberation, becoming a model for safe production in coal mines throughout the province.

    Because this coal mine attaches importance to safety work and has few accidents, the attendance rate of all employees has always been high, and their enthusiasm for labor is very high, thus ensuring a continuous leap forward in production year after year. In ten years, the mine has increased raw coal production by four hundred times. The production cost in 1959 decreased by 88.34% compared to 1950. By the end of May this year, the mine had already overfulfilled its production tasks for the first half of the year.

    In order to strengthen leadership in safe production, the mine's Party Branch Secretary and Mine Manager personally took charge, establishing a safety committee and safety teams. All safety measures are adopted using a method that combines top-down and bottom-up approaches, submitting them to the masses for full discussion before deciding on implementation. To strengthen safety education for workers, the mine regularly holds safety lectures, using real people and real events to educate everyone about the importance of safe production, while also teaching basic knowledge of safe production.

    In continuously strengthening safe production work, the Renhe Coal Mine has also established and improved a mass-based safety network. Each production team conducts a safety activity day every ten days, thus ensuring continuous safe production in the mine for the past ten years.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, July 20th: More than 300 employees in the Tangjiazhuang Mine No. 3 Mining Area of Kailuan Coal Mine have not had a major work-related injury accident for five years and eight months. They have overfulfilled the state's coal production plan every year and every month, achieving an overall leap forward in safe production.

    The Tangjiazhuang Mine No. 3 Mining Area was established in October 1954. By the end of June this year, it had mined thirty-six working faces, producing a total of more than 1.26 million tons of raw coal. Some of the working faces they mined had high coal seams and broken roofs, others were medium-thick coal seams with large water inflows and pressure, and most were thin coal seams, less than half a meter high, with very complex geological conditions. Thanks to excellent safety work, major natural accidents and work-related injuries such as water, fire, gas, and roof collapses that endanger underground safety production have been eliminated, ensuring safe production and monthly leaps forward. The daily output of raw coal has increased from 300 tons at the time of the area's establishment to the current 1,150 tons. Since 1956, it has been rated as an overall leap forward in safe production "Red Flag Area" among the more than sixty production areas in the entire Kailuan Coal Mine for four consecutive years.

    The monthly great leap forward in safe production in this mining area is the result of adhering to and implementing the Party's policy on safe production. From the day it was established, the Party Branch of the mining area listed safety work as one of the important items on the agenda of the branch committee. Since 1954, they have consistently conducted monthly evaluations and inspections of employees' safety awareness, adopting various methods to educate employees to correctly understand the dialectical unity of safety and production. Under the slogan of "Ensuring safety at all times, in all matters, in all places, and by everyone," all employees in the area have continuously carried out forty-two safety production discussion meetings since 1957, putting forward tens of thousands of suggestions, and plugging the loopholes in safe production in a timely manner. Because employees generally attach importance to safe production, there are more and more pace-setters in the overall leap forward in safe production. Since the beginning of this year, the mining area has selected three provincial-level safety production pace-setters, 111 municipal, Kailuan Mining Area, and mine-level safety production pace-setters, and twenty-five of the area's thirty-one production teams have been rated as safe production red flag teams.

    发动群众创造安全生产条件
    仁和煤矿和唐家庄第三采煤区安全生产全面跃进
    据新华社昆明电　云南省大关县仁和煤矿从解放到现在，十年来从未发生过重大事故，成为全省煤矿安全生产的一面红旗。
    这个煤矿由于重视安全工作，事故少，全矿职工出勤率一直很高，劳动热情十分高涨，因此保证了连年来生产的持续跃进。全矿在十年中使原煤产量增加了四百倍，1959年的生产成本比1950年下降了88.34％，今年到5月底就超额完成了上半年的生产任务。
    为了加强对安全生产的领导，全矿由支部书记和矿长亲自挂帅，建立了安全委员会和安全小组。各项安全措施都是采取自上而下和自下而上相结合的方法，交给群众充分讨论然后决定贯彻执行。为了加强对工人的安全教育，矿上经常举行安全讲座，用真人真事来教育大家重视安全生产，同时讲授安全生产的基本知识。
    在不断加强安全生产的工作中，仁和煤矿还建立和健全了群众性的安全网，各生产小组每十天就进行一次安全活动日，因此保证了全矿十年来一直持续安全生产。
    据新华社唐山20日电　开滦煤矿唐家矿第三采煤区三百多名职工连续五年零八个月未出过重大工伤事故。年年月月超额完成国家产煤计划，实现了安全生产全面大跃进。
    唐家庄矿采煤三区是1954年10月份建立的，到今年6月底，先后开采过三十六个工作面，共采原煤一百二十六万多吨。他们开采的工作面有的煤层较高，顶板破碎，有的是中厚煤层，顶水大、压力大，采得最多的还是薄煤层，高不到半米，地质条件十分复杂。由于安全工作作得出色，消灭了危害井下安全生产的水、火、瓦斯、顶板等重大的自然事故和工伤事故，保证了安全生产，月月跃进，原煤日产量已由建区时三百吨提高到目前的一千一百五十吨，1956年起，连续四年在开滦全矿六十多个生产区中被评为安全生产全面跃进“红旗区”。
    这个采煤区月月安全生产大跃进，是坚持贯彻党的安全生产方针的结果。采区党支部从建立那天起，就把安全工作列为支委会重要议事日程之一。他们从1954年起，一直坚持每月开展一次职工安全思想评比检查，采取各种办法教育职工正确认识安全与生产的辩证的统一关系。全区职工在“时时、事事、处处、人人保安”的口号下，从1957年到现在连续开展了四十二次安全生产鸣放辩论会，提出了上万条建议，适时地堵塞了安全生产的漏洞。由于职工普遍重视安全生产，安全生产全面跃进的标兵越来越多。今年以来，采区就选出了省级安全生产标兵三名，市、开滦矿区、本矿安全生产标兵一百一十一名，全区三十一个生产小队有二十五个被评为安全生产红旗队。
