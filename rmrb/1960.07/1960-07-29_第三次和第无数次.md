The movie "Notable Figures of Our Time" is currently playing in cinemas. This feature film is based on the invention of the high-voltage bridge by Wang Linhe. Furthermore, the magazine "China Youth" recently published "The Story of Wang Linhe and Xie Wen" written by Fei Liwen. At this time, we learned that Shanghai Electric Meter Factory’s young workers Zhang Huifa, Gao Weixun, Chen Wenxiang, and Yao Linxing had carried out a third revolution on the high-voltage bridge that Wang Linhe had made after 371 experiments and Xie Wen had reformed. The high-voltage bridge after the revolution is not only one-third smaller in volume, more economical in materials, and more aesthetically pleasing in appearance, but also simpler in structure, better in performance, and wider in application. This story of the third revolution is inspiring and thought-provoking.

The Shanghai Electric Meter Factory's four young workers' second revision of the high-voltage bridge shows that the wisdom of the people, who are armed with the theories of liberating thought, breaking superstitions, and continuous revolution, is infinite and their potential is inexhaustible. Because of this, Zhang Huifa and other comrades made the heroic oath: "Since Xie Wen dared to operate on the high-voltage bridge that Wang Linhe had successfully experimented with 371 times, we have the courage to revolutionize the high-voltage bridge that Xie Wen has operated on." The Party supported them, the masses helped them, and, coupled with their own hard work and ingenuity, they finally achieved their goal. Such moving examples are constantly being discovered in Shanghai and other cities. These facts vividly tell us that mountains have peaks, the sea has shores, but technical innovation, technical revolution, and scientific and cultural achievements will never end! There are mountains beyond mountains, heavens beyond heavens, and there can be an upstream above the upstream.

Wang Linhe, Xie Wen, Zhang Huifa, Gao Weixun, Chen Wenxiang, and Yao Linxing are all people who dare to create. Their actions embody the spirit of continuous revolution and progress of the Chinese working class in the Mao Zedong era. Marxists advocate adopting a critical and inherited attitude towards all scientific achievements, opposing blind worship. The communist cause is an earth-shaking and unprecedentedly great undertaking. For Marxists-Leninists, all scientific and cultural achievements of the past and present are just a stage in the total process of infinite development. They are by no means the highest peak or the ultimate limit. Everything is developing, and later generations must surpass their predecessors, and contemporary people must also be able to surpass all the achievements of outstanding contemporary figures. This is an objective law. We should learn from all outstanding scientific and cultural achievements and modern scientific and cultural achievements at home and abroad, but learning must not tie our hands and feet and hinder our creativity. We must learn from our predecessors, and even more so from contemporary heroic figures, and never underestimate ourselves. On the contrary, we must promote the spirit of bold creation, not be superstitious about the ancients, not be superstitious about foreigners, not be superstitious about books, and even more so not treat all scientific and cultural achievements and the creative inventions of current advanced figures with a solidified and rigid point of view. Such revolutionaries will inevitably and certainly surpass all past and current achievements.

The first revolution is valuable; the second and third revolutions are equally valuable, because they show infinitely beautiful prospects, open up a path of continuous progress, and by going straight ahead along this path, the fourth, fifth, tenth, hundredth… even countless revolutions can appear.

    第三次和第无数次
    刘丰
    电影院正在上映《风流人物数今朝》，这部故事片是以王林鹤发明高压电桥为蓝本的；“中国青年”杂志最近又发表了费礼文写的《王林鹤和谢文的故事》。就在这时候，我们看到上海电表厂青工张惠发、高为勋、陈文祥、姚林兴四人对王林鹤经过三百七十一次试验制成、又经谢文改革过的高压电桥，进行了第三次革命的消息。革命后的高压电桥，不仅体积又缩小三分之一，用料更省，外形美观，结构简单，性能更好，而且用途更广。这第三次革命的故事，使人振奋，也使人深思。
    上海电表厂四位青年工人二改高压电桥，这说明解放思想、破除迷信并经不断革命理论武装了的人民智慧是无穷的，潜力是挖掘不尽的。正是这样，所以张惠发等同志才会发出英雄的誓言：“谢文既然能在王林鹤经过三百七十一次才试验成功的高压电桥上动手术，我们就有胆量在谢文动过手术的高压电桥上革命”。党支持他们，群众帮助他们，加上他们自己苦干、巧干，终于达到了目的。像这样的动人事例，在上海，在别的城市，不断发现。这些事实生动地告诉我们：高山有顶，大海有涯，可是技术革新、技术革命和科学文化成就永远没有止境！山外还有山，天外还有天，上游上面还可以有上游。
    王林鹤、谢文、张惠发、高为勋、陈文祥、姚林兴这些人物，都是敢于创造的人，在他们的身上体现了我们这毛泽东时代中国工人阶级的不断革命的进取精神。马克思主义者主张对一切科学成就采取批判地继承的态度，反对盲目崇拜。共产主义事业是翻天复地、空前伟大的事业，对于马克思列宁主义者来说，从前和当代的一切科学文化的成就，都不过是无限发展的总过程的一个阶段，它们绝不是什么最高的顶峰或者最后的极限。一切事物都是发展着的，后人一定超过前人，当代的人也一定能超过当代的优秀人物的一切成就，这是客观的规律。我们应当向中外一切优秀的科学文化和现代科学文化成就学习，但学习决不能束缚我们的手脚，妨碍我们的创造性。我们要学习前人，也更要学习当代的英雄人物，绝不要妄自菲薄；相反地，要发扬大胆创造的精神，不迷信古人，不迷信外国人，不迷信书本，更不用凝固不变的死板的观点来对待一切科学文化成就和当前先进人物的创造发明，这样的革命者就必然会跨过也一定能跨过以往的和目前的一切既有的成就。
    第一次革命是可贵的；第二次、第三次革命同样可贵，因为它显示了无限美好的前景，它开辟了不断前进的道路，沿着它直往前走，可以出现第四次、第五次、第十次、第一百次……以至于第无数次革命。
