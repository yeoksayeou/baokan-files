    The Beautiful and Rich Xin Hai Lian
    Xu Yaolin, First Secretary of the CPC Xin Hai Lian Municipal Committee of Jiangsu

    Xin Hai Lian City only appeared on the map after liberation, but the Xin Hai Lian area has a long history. The ancient city of Haizhou at the foot of Jinping Mountain has been the political, economic, and cultural center of the Hai Lian area since the Qin and Han dynasties. Outside the city is "Kongwang Mountain," named after Confucius's ascent to view the sea during his travels around the kingdoms, with "Kongwang Pavilion" and large, exquisite Han dynasty reliefs. The former Yuntai Mountain, known as "Huaguo Mountain," is even more scenic, with numerous attractions. It boasts seventy-two scenic spots, each captivating. The "Zangjun Cave" where Tang Dynasty generals garrisoned troops is still scattered throughout the mountains; the "Tangwang Dam," a military water dam built by the Tang king during his eastern expedition, still reflects the sunlight; and the magnificent "Sanyuan Palace" and "Zhaohai Pavilion" from the Ming Dynasty still stand majestically amidst the lush greenery. At the foot of the 664-meter-high Hou Yuntai Mountain is the eastern gateway of the motherland—Lianyungang. It is not only a hub connecting domestic and foreign sea and land transportation, but also a magnificent and beautiful coastal scenic area comparable to Beidaihe. Nestled between mountains and sea, it is warm in winter and cool in summer, and evergreen in all seasons. No wonder there is the saying, "Extending four thousand miles westward from Longxi, Lianyungang is the first city eastward in the Huaihai region."

    What makes people even more proud is that this beautiful land is full of inexhaustible natural resources. There are dozens of underground mineral deposits; the mountains are covered with vast quantities of green pines, bamboos, and yellow sandalwood trees; chestnut, oil-tea, lacquer, walnut, ginkgo and other economic forests cover the hills; the famous Yunwu tea, Gu'an pears, winter peaches, and more than 300 kinds of medicinal materials such as the precious Dazicao (Lithospermum erythrorhizon), Platycodon grandiflorus, Polygonum multiflorum, Kudzu vine, and Dragon Scale Lichen are all produced on Yuntai Mountain. Below the mountains, on the hundreds of miles of beaches, snow-white "silver flowers" bloom in spring, summer, and autumn. This is the sea salt produced by the endless seawater. The salt fields have a history of more than 2,600 years, and "Huai Salt" is welcomed by the people. There is a saying, "The great salt of Huaibei travels throughout the Central Plains." In the sea, fish production is endless, and the famous Jiaji fish, Pomfret, and Prawns are produced off the coast of Lianyungang. Seawater can also be used to cultivate precious marine animals and plants such as sea cucumbers, nori, and kelp. Truly, "Xin Hai Lian City is a treasure garden, full of treasures above and below ground, with rich resources in the mountains and sea, inexhaustible and inexhaustible."

    When you drive east from Xinpu, the first thing you see is a series of snow-white silver mountains. Is it the unthawed snow of Yuntai Mountain? No. Those are the salt barns on the Xin Hai Lian salt fields. Before liberation, this salt field with a long history was entirely occupied by bureaucratic capitalists and salt merchants—the Yuanshang. The vast number of salt workers, known as "zaomin" (salt makers), owned nothing. The lives of the vast salt workers were difficult to protect, so what production enthusiasm could they have! Therefore, production was backward, the fields were barren, and the output was extremely low. "Groom the beach in March, dry in April, stop during the rainy season, and when the weather gradually gets cold in October, rest and rest for next year’s drying." This was the production schedule of the Huaibei salt fields for thousands of years. This was the resistance of the vast salt workers to the rulers and exploiters. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the consciousness of the vast salt workers gradually increased. They deeply understood the important role of crude salt in socialist construction. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, they were ambitious and high-spirited. They built more than a hundred li of wave-blocking dikes, expanded the new salt fields by more than 50,000 mu, and increased the national output of crude salt by millions of tons every year. The centuries-old production schedule has long been broken by them, with production every month of the year. "Groom the beach in January, dry in February, keep going during the rainy season, not afraid of the cold in October, and silver flowers bloom in the cold winter months," this is their current production schedule.

    If you climb Wanghai Tower, the rolling waves of the vast ocean will be displayed before your eyes. Thousands of motorized sailing fishing boats freely chase fish schools on the sea; the pier of Lianyungang, like a long corridor, stretches from the foot of Hou Yuntai Mountain into the heart of the sea, with thousands of tons, or even tens of thousands of tons, of giant ships loaded with various materials entering and leaving the harbor; wisps of green smoke rise from ships, factories, and locomotives, weaving together with the white clouds coming from the east, drifting slowly westward; the roar of trains, the whistle of ships, and the proud fisherman’s songs echo each other, reverberating throughout the entire valley. At night, the stars in the sky, the lights on the shore, and the golden light of thousands of points are reflected on the seabed. Seeing this cannot help but remind us that before liberation, the ships flying the "rice" flag, the Stars and Stripes, and later the sun flag, were anchored in the harbor, and the imperialists exerted their power to the fullest, taking away from here we don’t know how much salt, coal, phosphorus, and grain; and they also killed we don’t know how many outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland. After liberation, the five-star red flag swept away all the past humiliations of China. The era of imperialists running rampant in our ports, plundering our raw materials, and dumping their goods has long ended. Now our port construction has exceeded the scale planned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and giant ships of thousands of tons can pass unimpeded.

    Near the commercial port, a strong Lianyungang fishing vessel base is being built. The mechanized and electrified ice-making and refrigeration plant—a five-story refrigeration building with a capacity of 3,000 tons—has been completed and put into production, and brand-new fishing vessels are already chasing fish schools in the Yellow Sea. The construction of this fishing vessel base marks a huge development in our Jiangsu Province's marine fisheries production, and coastal fishermen will also gradually realize modernized fishing under the leadership of the fishing vessel base.

    A new industrial city is rapidly developing on the coast of the Yellow Sea in the motherland. The rich and beautiful Xin Hai Lian has fully exerted its youthful vitality, and 240,000 people have drawn the newest and most beautiful picture: a consumer city has become a production city; the originally narrow and dirty urban area is now wide with roads, lined with tall buildings, and the city appearance has been transformed into neat, clean, and solemn; illiteracy has been eliminated throughout the city, primary education has been popularized, and senior high schools and secondary vocational schools are all over the city; Yuntai Mountain, known as "the Pengying of the world," and the scenic spots of Kongwang Mountain and Lianyungang Xugou have been opened as people's parks, and historical sites have been renovated, so that people can rest and enjoy themselves after work... However, Xin Hai Lian has not stopped here. We are using redoubled efforts to dress up this city even better!

    美丽富饶的新海连
    中共江苏新海连市委第一书记　许耀林
    新海连市还是解放以后才出现在地图上的，但新海连这块地方却有着悠久的历史了。锦屏山下古老的海州城，远在秦汉时代就已成为海连地区政治、经济、文化的中心。城外有孔子周游列国时因他登山望海而命名的“孔望山”，山上有“孔望亭”，有汉代大片精美的浮雕。被称为“花果山”的前云台山更是景色宜人，满山名胜。那里有七十二景，景景迷人。唐将屯兵的“藏军洞”，依然满布山野；唐王征东时修筑的军用水坝——“唐王坝”，依然清水映日；明代的宏伟建筑“三元宫”和“照海亭”，依然在万绿丛中，巍峨屹立。拔海六百六十四米的后云台山下，就是祖国东大门——连云港。这里不仅是一个沟通中外海陆交通的枢纽，而且是一个气势雄伟，景色绮丽可与北戴河媲美的海滨景区。这里依山傍海，群山环抱，真是冬暖夏凉，四季常青。无怪乎有“陇湃西去四千里，淮海东来第一城”的诗句。
    然而更加使人自豪的还是在这块美丽的土地上，到处都蕴藏着取之不尽用之不竭的自然资源。地下矿藏达数十种；山上，长着大量的青松绿竹，黄檀杉树；板栗、油茶、漆树、核桃、银杏等经济林木，布满山岗；著名的云雾茶、古安梨、冬桃及珍贵的大紫草、桔梗、首乌、葛藤、龙衣等三百多种药材都出产在云台山上。山下，在数百里的海滩上，每逢春夏秋三季盛开着雪白的“银花”，这就是人们用滔滔不绝的海水制成的海盐。盐场已有二千六百多年的历史，“淮盐”受到广大人民的欢迎。有“淮北大盐驰中原”的赞句。海里，鱼产无穷无尽，驰名中外的加吉鱼、昌鱼、对虾就产在连云港外。利用海水还可以养殖海参、紫菜、海带等名贵的海产动植物。真是“新海连市是宝园，地上地下万宝全，山上海里资源富，取之不尽用不完”。
    当你从新浦驱车东下的时候，首先看到的是一座座雪白的银山。是云台山的积雪未化吗？不是的。那就是新海连盐场上的盐廩。这个有悠久历史的盐场，在解放前全部为官僚资本家和盐业资本家——垣商所占有。被称为“灶民”的广大盐工则一无所有。广大盐工生命都难保，还有什么生产情绪！因此生产落后，场面荒芜，产量极低。“三月整滩四月晒，雷雨季节停下来，十月天气逐渐冷，休息休息明年晒。”这是千百年来淮北盐场生产的时间表。这是广大盐工对统治者、剥削者的抗拒。解放后在党的领导下，广大盐工的觉悟逐渐提高，他们深知原盐在社会主义建设中的重要作用，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，雄心勃勃，志气昂扬。他们修筑了百余华里长的挡浪大堤，扩建了五万多亩面积的新盐滩，每年为国家增产上百万吨原盐。百年来的生产时间表早被他们打破，一年十二个月，月月生产。“一月整滩二月晒，雷雨季节照常来，十月入冬不怕冷，寒冬腊月银花开”，这是他们现在的生产时间表。
    如果你登上望海楼，波浪滚滚的汪洋大海首先展现在你的眼底，千百艘机帆渔船在海面上自由地追捕鱼群；连云港长廊似的码头，从后云台山下伸向海心，数千吨，乃至万吨巨轮满载着各种物资出入港湾；轮船、工厂、机车上冒着缕缕青烟，和东来的朵朵白云交织相聚冉冉西去；火车的吼叫，轮船的笛鸣，自豪的渔歌，遥相呼应，回荡在整个山谷。入夜，天上的星，岸上的灯，倒映海底，金光万点。看到这里不禁使我们联想到解放前这里港湾里停泊着挂“米”字旗、星条旗、后来是挂太阳旗的舰艇和商船，帝国主义者施尽了他们的威风，从这里劫走了我们不知多少盐、煤、磷、粮；也不知杀害了祖国多少优秀的儿女。解放后，五星红旗横扫了过去中国的一切耻辱，帝国主义横行我们的港口，劫夺我们的原料，倾销他们的商品的时代，早已结束了。现在我们的港口建设已经超过孙中山先生规划的规模，数千吨巨轮可以畅通无阻。
    在商港附近，正在兴建着强大的连云港渔轮基地。机械化电气化的制冰冷藏厂——容量三千吨的五层冷藏大楼已经竣工投入生产，崭新的渔轮已经在黄海上追捕鱼群。这座渔轮基地的兴建标志着我们江苏省海洋渔业生产上的一个巨大发展，沿海渔民，也将在渔轮基地的带动下，逐步实现近代化的捕捞。
    一座新兴的工业城市，在祖国的黄海之滨迅速发展起来。富饶美丽的新海连充分发挥了它的青春活力，二十四万人民画出了最新最美的图画：消费城市变成了生产城市；原是狭窄肮脏的市区，现在马路宽敞，高楼大厦林立，市容一变而为整齐清洁庄严；全市文盲已扫除，小学教育已普及，高级中学和中等专业学校布满全市；素称“人世蓬瀛”的云台山及孔望山、连云墟沟等风景区，都已开辟为人民公园，名胜古迹重加整修，人们劳动之余可以憩息赏玩；……。然而新海连并不曾到此为止，我们正用加倍的努力把这座城市打扮得更美更好！
