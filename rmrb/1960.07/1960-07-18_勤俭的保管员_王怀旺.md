　　The Frugal Storekeeper – Wang Huaiwang
　　In our Gaoping Commune's Xishan Management District, when people mention Wang Huaiwang, the Communist Party member and storekeeper, the commune members all say in unison: "He is our model of frugality, our good storekeeper."
　　"Repairing and patching, making do if possible" has become Wang Huaiwang's daily work habit. If any of the furniture used by the Management District is broken, he finds ways to repair it. Recently, there weren't enough sacks for collecting wheat. Buying a new sack would cost eight or nine yuan, but not buying one would be inconvenient for urgent use. While he was worrying, Wang Huaiwang remembered that there were still seven torn sacks stored in the warehouse. He patched up these seven tattered sacks so that they were sturdy enough to use. Since he became a storekeeper in 1957, he has used the "repairing and patching" method to repair more than 230 small farm tools and more than 100 pieces of vehicles and furniture, saving a total of more than 400 yuan.
　　Once, Wang Changsheng, an animal caretaker from the First Production Team, asked the storekeeper for livestock "saddle pads." Wang Huaiwang said, "When I inspected them a few days ago, the 'saddle pads' were still usable. Why are you asking for new ones? Bring the damaged ones to exchange!" However, many days passed, and Wang Changsheng did not come to exchange them. Wang Huaiwang drew a lesson from this and, after discussing it with the management committee, formulated a system of exchanging old for new. Due to Wang Huaiwang's influence in running the commune frugally, many people in our management district have developed a good habit of cherishing tools.

　　勤俭的保管员——王怀旺
    在我们高平公社西山管理区，一提起共产党员、保管员王怀旺，社员都异口同声地说：“他是我们的勤俭模范，是我们的好保管员。”
    “修修补补、能对付就对付”已经成了王怀旺日常工作的习惯。管理区使用的一切家具破了坏了，他就想办法修好。最近收麦子的布袋不够用，买一条新布袋得花八、九元，不买吧，又急等着用，正在发愁的时候，王怀旺想起库房里还放着七条破烂布袋，他把这七条破烂布袋补得结结实实，用上了。他从1957年当保管员以来，用“修修补补”的办法，共修理了二百三十多件小农具、一百多件车辆家具，共节省开支四百多元。
    有一次，第一生产队使役员王长生找保管员要牲口“坐球”。王怀旺说：“前几天检查的时候，‘坐球’还能用，怎么又要领新的？你把坏的拿来换吧！”可是，过了很多天，王长生也没有来换。王怀旺从这件事中得出了一条经验，经过和管理委员会研究，制订了一项交旧领新的制度。由于王怀旺勤俭办社的影响，我们管理区有许多人养成了爱惜工具的良好风气。
