Cadres in Various Regions Settle Down and Take Root on the Front Lines
Nantong Prefecture and County-Level Organs Implement the "Three-Thirds System"

(Our Newspaper Report) In order to concentrate main leadership forces on grasping agriculture, the party and government organs at the Nantong Prefecture and county levels in Jiangsu Province, in the spirit of the "Two-Five System" and based on specific circumstances, have universally implemented the "Three-Thirds System" to allow the majority of cadres to settle down and take root on the front lines of agricultural production.

Of the more than 3,000 cadres in the Nantong Prefecture and county-level party and government organs, one-third have already or are in the process of going to communes, production brigades, production teams, and canteens to serve as deputy secretaries, deputy captains, accountants, and grain administrators; one-third are going to advanced and backward communes and teams to conduct investigations and research, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and help local Party committees organize mass movements for high yields to become even higher, low yields to catch up with high yields, poor teams to catch up with rich teams, and backward to catch up with advanced; and the remaining one-third of the cadres are staying in the organs to handle daily work and are responsible for communication between higher and lower levels.

Under the influence of the prefectural and county committee leadership organs' cadres going deep into the front lines, the Party committees of all people's communes in the region have also discussed and improved their leadership methods in the spirit of the "Two-Five System." Based on the specific conditions of their respective communes, some have implemented a "One-Four System," while others have implemented a "Three-Seven System," devoting the majority of their time to the agricultural production front. On the one hand, they are using commanding fields and high-yield plots as their battleground to launch a high tide of field management for autumn-ripening crops, focusing on weeding, topdressing, and pest control; on the other hand, they are focusing on going deep into backward teams to help them catch up with the advanced, so as to achieve balanced development of all teams and all aspects of production.

Linqing Reduces Documents and Reports Significantly, Regularizing Study Time

Xinhua News Agency Report: Linqing City, Shandong Province, has universally promoted the "Two-Five System" leadership method, successively delegating a large number of cadres to go deep into the front lines of production, greatly strengthening leadership over grassroots work.

After the cadres went deep into the front lines of production, they universally promoted the "Two-Five System," strengthening specific leadership over production. Many commune cadres have conscientiously strived to eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, and their work has become more solid. Unnecessary documents and reports sent down to the grassroots have now been greatly reduced, many problems are resolved on the spot, meetings have been streamlined, and grassroots cadres are avoided from leaving their battle posts as much as possible. At present, all communes have also universally established normal study systems, with cadres at all levels gathering for study once or twice a week to summarize and review work, and spending the remaining five days universally in the small teams they are responsible for, participating in production and leading production.

Chayashan Commune Achieves Great Leap Forward in Central Work, Departments' Work Fly Red Flags

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, has achieved remarkable results after implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method. All 388 commune and brigade cadres are assigned to 221 production teams, with cadres conscientiously going deep into the front lines of production, promptly discovering and more effectively helping grassroots cadres solve problems in production.

Through the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, the business work of all departments directly under the commune has more closely served the central work, ensuring that both the central work and the departmental work achieve a double leap forward. After cadres in the commune's machinery factory implemented this leadership method, in addition to working alongside workers in the workshop, they also specifically organized an investigation and research team to go to production teams and work with the commune members to understand their needs. During the summer planting season, they discovered that the six-row seeders manufactured by the factory last year were left unused. After inquiring, they learned that the seeders were only able to plant wheat but not beans because the seed holes were too small. They immediately organized a repair and maintenance team to inspect and repair the seeders in each production team. Cadres in the commune's general merchandise store regularly go deep into the grassroots retail outlets to strengthen political and business leadership, bring goods to the fields, work with the masses during production, sell goods during breaks, and understand the commune members' demands for sales and purchases. In this way, they have greatly facilitated the masses, served production, and expanded sales and purchasing business.

    田间共同劳动　现场出谋划策　解决问题深透
    各地干部在第一线落户扎根
    南通地、县两级机关推行“三三制”
    本报讯　为了集中主要领导力量抓好农业，江苏省南通专区的地、县两级党、政机关本着“二五制”精神，根据具体情况普遍推行“三三制”，让大多数干部在农业生产第一线落户扎根。
    南通专区地、县两级党政机关的三千多名干部，三分之一已经或正在到公社、生产大队、生产队和食堂里去担任副书记、副队长、会计和粮食管理员等职务；三分之一到先进和后进社、队去调查研究，总结和推广先进经验，并帮助当地党委组织高产更高产、低产赶高产、穷队赶富队、后进赶先进的群众运动；还有三分之一的干部留在机关，处理日常工作，负责上下联系。
    在地委、县委领导机关干部深入第一线的影响下，全区各人民公社党委也根据“二五制”的精神，讨论和改进了领导方法，并根据本社的具体条件，有的实行“一四制”，有的实行“三七制”，把主要时间用到农业生产战线上来，一方面以指挥田和丰产片为阵地，掀起以锄草、追肥、治虫为中心的秋熟作物田间管理高潮；一方面重点深入后进队，帮助后进赶先进，以便使各队和各项生产平衡发展。
    临清文件表报大减少，学习时间经常化
    据新华社讯　山东省临清市普遍推行“二五制”的领导方法，陆续下放了大批干部，深入生产第一线，大大加强了对基层工作的领导。
    干部深入生产第一线以后，普遍推行了“二五制”，加强了对生产的具体领导。许多公社的干部认真做到和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，工作做得扎实了。现在下达到基层的不必要的文件和表报已大为减少，许多问题就地解决，精简了会议，尽量避免基层干部离开战斗岗位。目前各公社还普遍建立了正常的学习制度，每星期一二，各级干部都分别集中起来进行学习，或者总结检查工作，其余的五天普遍到自己所包干的小队里，参加生产，领导生产。
    嵖岈山公社中心工作大跃进，部门业务插红旗
    据新华社讯　河南省遂平县嵖岈山人民公社推行“二五制”领导方法后，已经取得了显著效果。全公社三百八十八名社、大队干部，分包二百二十一个生产小队，干部踏踏实实地深入生产第一线，及时发现并更加切实地帮助基层干部解决了生产中的问题。
    通过实行“二五制”的领导方法，使社直属各个部门的业务工作更加紧密地服务于中心工作，保证了中心工作与部门工作双跃进。公社机械厂干部在贯彻执行这一领导方法后，除在车间和工人一起劳动外，还专门组织了调查研究小组，到生产小队和社员一起劳动，了解社员的要求。在夏播中，他们发现去年厂里制造的六行播种耧都放着没用，经了解因耧眼小能播种麦不能播种豆子，他们马上组织了修配小组，到各生产队检修。公社综合商店干部定期深入到基层门市部，加强政治、业务的领导，并带货下田，生产时和群众一起劳动，休息时售货，并了解社员对售、购的要求，这样，既大大方便了群众，服务了生产，又扩大了购销业务。
