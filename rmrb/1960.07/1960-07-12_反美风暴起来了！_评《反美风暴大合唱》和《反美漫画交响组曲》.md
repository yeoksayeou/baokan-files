　　“Anti-American Storm is Rising!”
　　——A Review of "Anti-American Storm Chorus" and "Anti-American Cartoon Symphony Suite"
　　Ye Lin
    In the capital's "Propaganda Week Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace," many new musical works with strong fighting spirit have emerged. The large-scale vocal work "Anti-American Storm Chorus" and the orchestral work "Anti-American Cartoon Symphony Suite" are two outstanding examples.
    I have listened to the performance of "Anti-American Storm Chorus" several times. This work has a strong artistic appeal, inspiring a strong anti-American struggle political enthusiasm and strength every time I hear it. "Anti-American Storm Chorus" and "Anti-American Cartoon Symphony Suite," despite some shortcomings, represent a new development in our revolutionary music at this stage.
    Our revolutionary music has always had a tradition of combat. Revolutionary mass songs are often like sharp daggers, directly reflecting the current revolutionary struggle and serving proletarian politics. This fighting tradition has been further developed in all musical forms today. Even large musical forms such as choruses or orchestral pieces can be created, rehearsed, and performed in just a few days, participating in the struggle against U.S. imperialism alongside mass songs and other musical forms, and achieving high success. This marks the growing maturity of our musicians' artistic abilities and, more importantly, embodies their full political enthusiasm and emphasis on the fighting tradition of revolutionary music. This revolutionary style and artistic distinctiveness are something to be proud of, and are important achievements made by our artists under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.
    These two works are so powerful because they both have a strong sense of the times and can relatively focus on expressing the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people against U.S. imperialism. In the first section of "Anti-American Storm Chorus," "Anti-American Storm is Rising," there is a strong momentum. The singing pours down from all directions, and the anti-American calls are louder than the last. In this section, the composer uses modulation techniques to depict the scale of the current world people's anti-American struggle, issuing a battle call in the anti-American storm. The singing is very powerful and full of confidence in victory. Especially exciting is the third section of this chorus, "Chinese People's Anti-American Demonstration," which is a march in the style of a mass song. The rhythm is neat and powerful, showing the majestic lineup of millions of people in the demonstration. Then, the people's team roared, and the powerful singing sang: "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan, out of Asia, out of Africa, out of Latin America, out of Europe!" The singing at the end became a collectively shouted slogan, exciting all the audience, and the entire audience could not help but shout in unison with the rhythm of the chorus, and the slogan "Oppose U.S. Imperialism and Defend Peace" resounded throughout the theater. Finally, the slogan returned to singing, resulting in a more powerful ending. This section of the chorus seems to be able to be adapted into a mass song for the masses to sing during parades and demonstrations. I believe it can inspire people's fighting spirit and become their battle song on a wider scale.
    The other sections of this chorus are also well written. The fifth section, "The East Wind Blows All Over the World," is a paean-style ode, especially the middle and end sections, which are full of optimism and lofty ideals, embodying the truth that the socialist camp is the strongest fortress for defending world peace, and is very infectious.
    In terms of portraying the just anti-American struggle of the people, the "Anti-American Cartoon Symphony Suite" has the same achievements. Because this suite does not have the help of lyrics, it uses revolutionary mass song tunes as much as possible in its creation method. This method is easy for the masses to understand, especially with the help of slide cartoons during the performance, and almost every detail is clear and understandable. This original attempt is worth encouraging. It helps to express the content of the music and is an effective way for symphony music to be popularized among the masses and serve politics.
    The shortcoming of this symphony is that, because U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are caricatured like clowns, the musical portrayal makes people feel that the faces of this group of war criminals are ugly and despicable, but not insidious and vicious enough. This may be a common phenomenon in many anti-American artistic creations. In dealing with U.S. imperialism, we must both despise him and educate the people to raise their vigilance. If we can portray both the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of U.S. imperialism and its unchanging nature of aggression to the death, and at the same time emphasize the scale of the people's anti-American struggle, it will be more complete.
    The emergence of these two works also reflects the victory of taking the mass line in creation and giving play to the spirit of collective creation. The "Anti-American Storm Chorus" was collectively written by the editorial department of "Poetry Magazine" and collectively composed by the composition department of the Central Conservatory of Music. This new type of cooperative relationship achieved success from the beginning. The "Anti-American Cartoon Symphony Suite" is a collective creation of the amateur creation group of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra Symphony Orchestra. They have had many creative practices in the past, and this time is another bumper harvest after their creation of the "Mu Guiying Takes Command" symphony.
    The performance of "Anti-American Storm Chorus" by the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Liberation Army is also remarkable. Although the rehearsal had a lot of crash aspects, their creative attitude was very serious, with full of political enthusiasm and many careful designs, especially the handling of the "Chinese People's Anti-American Demonstration" section, which added a lot of color to this work, is more original, pushing their choral art to a new level.
    Our artists participated in the anti-American struggle with the greatest enthusiasm, using artistic weapons to fight U.S. imperialism with the people of the world. At the same time, the raging anti-American struggle has in turn exercised us and promoted the more vigorous development of our art. Let us more bravely throw ourselves into the battle, perform more and better musical works, and more heavily attack this vicious enemy until we finally bury him!

　　“反美风暴起来了！”
　　——评《反美风暴大合唱》和《反美漫画交响组曲》
　　叶林
    在首都的“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的艺术演出中，出现了不少具有强烈战斗性的音乐新作品。大型声乐作品《反美风暴大合唱》和管弦乐作品《反美漫画交响组曲》是其中突出的两部。
    我听《反美风暴大合唱》的演出已经有好几遍了。这部作品具有强烈的艺术感染力，使人每次听到后都不禁激发起一种强烈的反美斗争政治热情和力量。《反美风暴大合唱》和《反美漫画交响组曲》，尽管还存在着一些不足的地方，但它们的出现，却是我们的革命音乐在现阶段的一种新的发展。
    我们的革命音乐一贯具有战斗的传统，革命的群众歌曲往往像锐利的匕首一样，直接反映当前的革命斗争，为无产阶级政治服务。这种战斗的传统在今天已经进一步在所有的音乐创作形式当中得到了普遍的发扬。即使是大合唱或是管弦乐这样的庞大的音乐形式，也能够在短短数天之内，从创作、排练到演出，一气呵成，和群众歌曲等其它音乐形式在一道，参加了反对美帝国主义的斗争，而且得到了较高的成就。这是我国音乐家们的艺术能力日趋成熟的标志，同时，更是他们具有饱满的政治热情和重视革命音乐战斗传统的具体表现。这种革命的风格和艺术上的鲜明的战斗性是足以自豪的，是我们艺术工作者在毛泽东文艺思想教导下所取得的重要的成果。
    这两部作品能够产生这样大的力量，还在于它们都具有强烈的时代气息，能够比较集中地表现出中国人民反对美帝国主义的思想和感情。在《反美风暴大合唱》第一节“反美风暴起来了”中，有着强烈的气势，歌声从四面八方倾泻下来，反美的呼声，一浪更比一浪高。作曲家在这一节中运用了转调的手法，刻划了当前世界人民反美斗争的声势规模，在反美风暴中发出了战斗的号召。歌声很有力量，而且具有战斗的必胜的信心。特别使人激动的还有这首大合唱的第三节“中国人民反美大示威”，这是一首具有群众歌曲风格的进行曲，节拍整齐而有力，表现出千百万人民群众示威队伍的雄壮的阵容。接着，人民的队伍发出了怒吼，有力的歌声唱出了：“美帝国主义从台湾、从亚洲、从非洲、从拉丁美洲、从欧洲滚出去！”歌声到最后成了集体呼喊的口号，它激动着所有的听众，不由得全场随着合唱队的节奏整齐地呼喊起来，“反对美帝、保卫和平”的口号响彻整个剧场。最后，口号又回复到歌声，得到了更有力的结束。这一节合唱，看来可以改编为供群众在游行示威时演唱的群众歌曲，相信一定可以在更广泛的范围内，鼓舞人民的斗志，成为他们的战歌。
    这首大合唱的其它各节也都写得很好。第五节“东风吹遍全世界”是一首凯歌式的颂歌，特别是中段和末段，充满了乐观主义的精神和崇高的理想，体现了社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平最坚强的堡垒这一真理，很有感染力。
    在刻划人民群众的反美正义斗争的方面，《反美漫画交响组曲》有着同样的成就。这首组曲因为没有歌词的帮助，所以在创作方法上尽量采用了革命群众歌曲的曲调。这种方法很容易为群众所理解，特别是在演出时加上幻灯漫画的帮助，差不多在一些细节的描写方面也都是清楚明了的。这种独创性的尝试是值得鼓励的，它有助于表现乐曲的内容，是当前交响乐向群众普及、为政治服务的有效的途径。
    这首交响乐的美中不足是，由于把美帝国主义及其走狗像小丑似地漫画化了，因而在音乐刻划上使人感到这一群战争罪犯的嘴脸丑恶、卑鄙有余，而阴险、毒辣不足。这可能是当前许多反美艺术创作中比较容易遇到的现象。对待美帝国主义，我们既要鄙视他，同时又要教育人民提高警惕，如果能够把美帝国主义外强中干和侵略本性至死不变这两个方面都刻划出来，同时把人民群众的反美斗争的声势规模更强调一些，那就更为完整。
    这两部作品的出现，还体现了创作上大走群众路线，发挥集体创作精神的胜利。《反美风暴大合唱》是“诗刊”编辑部集体作词，中央音乐学院作曲系集体作曲的，这种新型的合作关系一开始就获得了成功。《反美漫画交响组曲》则是中央乐团交响乐队业余创作组的集体创作。他们过去已经有了不少创造性的实践，这一次是他们继创作《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐之后的又一次大丰收。
    人民解放军总政歌舞团演出的《反美风暴大合唱》的成绩也是显著的。尽管排练带有很大的突击性，但他们的创作态度却很严肃，有充沛的政治热情，有许多精心的设计，尤其是对使这部作品生色不少的
  “中国人民反美大示威”一节的处理，更具有独创性，使他们的合唱艺术推进到一个新的水平。
    我们的艺术家们用最大的热情参加了反美斗争，用艺术武器和全世界人民在一起打击美帝国主义。与此同时，如火如荼的反美斗争反过来又锻炼了我们，促使我们的艺术得到更蓬勃的发展。让我们更勇猛地投入战斗，演出更多更好的音乐作品，更沉重地打击这个凶恶的敌人，直到最后把它埋葬！
