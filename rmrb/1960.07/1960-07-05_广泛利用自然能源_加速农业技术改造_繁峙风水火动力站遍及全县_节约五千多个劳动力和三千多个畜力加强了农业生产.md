Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The people's communes in Fanshi County, Shanxi Province, are vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of wind, water, fire, and animal power according to local conditions. They are giving full play to their effectiveness in 41 types of production such as water lifting, steam, blowing, sawing, plowing, power generation, and processing. Work efficiency has increased by one to thirteen times, freeing up a large number of laborers and livestock to invest in agricultural production.

The people's communes in Fanshi County, under the new situation of large production tasks and insufficient labor and livestock, have launched a mass movement to comprehensively utilize natural wind, water, fire, and animal power under the slogan of "Demand power and labor from wind, water, fire, and livestock." Currently, more than 80% of the management areas in the county have wind, water, fire, and animal-powered quick mills, which can grind nearly 300,000 catties of flour every day, completely solving the grain processing problem for the county's 280,000 people. At the same time, wind power has been comprehensively utilized in ten major productions such as water lifting, plowing, power generation, blowing, sewing, stone grinding, and stone rolling, increasing work efficiency by one to thirteen times. Water power has been used for milling flour, generating electricity, sawing, high irrigation, and blowing. All of the county's 88 diesel engines, boiler engines, and gas engines have been comprehensively utilized, developing from pumping water for irrigation during busy farming seasons and processing grain during slack seasons to using steam for cooking, sawing, generating electricity, chopping grass, and driving machine production. More than 300 management areas in the county have achieved steam cooking. In terms of animal power, it has developed from one animal pulling one mill to one animal pulling two mills.

The result of Fanshi County's vigorous comprehensive utilization of wind, water, fire, and animal power is that the county has freed up 5,200 laborers and 3,500 livestock to invest in drought resistance and planting, ensuring that this year's spring planting task in the county was not only completed ten days ahead of last year, but also the planting quality exceeded any previous year. With the continuous increase of labor in industrial production, the total output value from January to May increased by 97% compared to the same period last year.

Fanshi County began to use wind, water, and fire to drive grinding and milling in 1959. Last year, the county installed a total of 165 mechanical power mills, water mills, wind mills, and animal-powered quick mills, grinding nearly 200,000 catties of flour every day. This not only solved the grain processing problem for 70% of the people in the county, but also freed up 1,500 laborers and 1,650 livestock to invest in the front line of agricultural production. In order to promote popularization and improvement, the Fanshi County Party Committee, based on summarizing past experiences, proposed this year to simultaneously manage "wind, water, fire, and livestock," developing from single-item innovation to comprehensive utilization. Each commune and factory has established special technical innovation research institutions to carry out shaping, appraisal, matching, and summary work. The county party committee also held technical training classes to help the communes train 316 technical experts, and dispatched more than 50 technical personnel with higher technical levels to go deep into various places for roving inspections and guidance, so that this comprehensive utilization movement of the four major forces quickly formed a climax in the county.

    广泛利用自然能源  加速农业技术改造
    繁峙风水火动力站遍及全县
    节约五千多个劳动力和三千多个畜力加强了农业生产
    新华社太原讯　山西省繁峙县各人民公社因地制宜地大搞风力、水力、火力、畜力综合利用，在提水、蒸气、吹风、拉锯、耕地、发电、加工等四十一种生产上充分发挥了效益，工作效率提高了一至十三倍，因之腾出了大批劳力、畜力投入了农业生产。
    繁峙县各人民公社，根据生产任务大、劳力、畜力不足的新形势，在向“风、水、火、畜”要动力，要劳力的口号下，普遍掀起了群众性的综合利用自然风力、水力、火力和畜力的运动。现在全县80％以上的管理区都有了风力、水力、火力、畜力快速磨，每天即可磨面粉近三十万斤，使全县二十八万人的吃粮加工问题全部得到了解决。同时，风力已经在提水、耕地、发电、吹风、缝纫、石磨、石碾等十大生产上进行综合利用，工效提高了一至十三倍。水力，已经用于磨面、发电、拉锯、高灌、吹风等方面；全县八十八部柴油机、锅驼机和煤气机，全部进行了综合利用，由过去农忙时抽水浇地、农闲时加工粮食，发展到利用蒸气做饭、拉锯、发电、铡草、带动机器生产。全县已有三百多个管理区实现了做饭蒸气化。在畜力上，已由过去一畜拉一磨，发展为一畜拉双磨。
    繁峙县大搞风、水、火、畜力综合利用的结果，使全县腾出了五千二百个劳力和三千五百个畜力，投入了抗旱抢种，保证了全县今年春播任务不仅比去年提前十天胜利结束，而且播种质量也超过以往任何一年。工业生产在不断增加劳力的情况下，1至5月份，总产值却比去年同期增加97％。
    繁峙县在1959年就开始利用风力、水力和火力带动碾磨。去年全县共安装起机械动力磨、水力磨、风力磨、畜力快速磨一百六十五台，每天磨面近二十万斤，它不仅使全县70％的人吃粮加工问题得到解决，而且腾出了一千五百个劳力和一千六百五十头畜力，投入了农业生产第一线。中共繁峙县委为了大普及和大提高，今年在总结过去经验的基础上，又提出了“风、水、火、畜”四管齐下，由单项革新发展到成龙配套的综合利用。各公社和厂矿，都专门成立了技术革新研究机构，进行定型、鉴定，配套，总结等工作，县委并举办了技术训练班，帮助各公社培养出三百一十六名技术能手，同时抽出五十多名技术水平较高的技术人员，深入各地巡回检查，帮助指导，因而使这四大综合利用运动，在全县很快形成高潮。
