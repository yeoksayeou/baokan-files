Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 11th: Poland is accelerating the pace of basic construction. This year, there are more than a thousand large and medium-sized construction projects being newly built and expanded, and there are forty of the largest industrial construction projects. Basic construction workers all over the country are working actively and enthusiastically to complete construction tasks ahead of schedule. This year, Poland has adopted the method of concentrating investment in basic construction. A large number of construction projects will be completed and put into production this year, which will play an important role in accelerating the construction speed during the next five-year plan.

This year, Poland's total investment in basic construction will reach 90 billion zlotys, an increase of 6.4% over the actual investment last year. The main task of basic construction this year is to complete the basic construction tasks during the 1956-1960 Five-Year Plan and prepare for accelerating the development of the national economy during the next Five-Year Plan. Therefore, investment in production construction accounts for 69% of the total investment. Basic construction investment is mainly used for sectors such as electricity, metallurgy, and chemicals, which are of great significance to the development of industrial and agricultural production in the future, as well as for building industrial raw material bases such as coal mines and copper mines.

Poland is currently building and expanding seven large power stations, and it is expected that the country's power generation capacity will increase by more than 620,000 kilowatts this year compared with last year.

The main task of basic construction in the metallurgical industry is to continue to expand the Nowa Huta Lenin Metallurgical Plant and the Warsaw High-Quality Steel Plant. This year, two rolling mills, a steel pipe factory, and open-hearth furnace No. 9 of Nowa Huta will be put into production. Two open-hearth furnaces and an ingot workshop of the Warsaw High-Quality Steel Plant will also be put into production. The production capacity of the Warsaw High-Quality Steel Plant can be increased to 300,000 tons this year.

Many large factories and mines in other industrial sectors are also under construction and expansion. Not long ago, Poland's largest Plock oil refinery started construction, and the Ursus tractor factory in the suburbs of Warsaw has begun to be expanded into a large factory with an annual output of 36,000 tractors. In addition, eleven coal mines are being expanded and newly built, and Europe's famous Turov open-pit coal mine is also being expanded.

Basic construction workers in various parts of Poland, in order to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the Polish National Day (July 22), have pledged to complete the construction tasks ahead of schedule before this day and hand over the construction projects for use. It is expected that the new industrial projects that will be put into production before July 22 will include the Lodz Building Materials Factory, the Wierzbica Cement Factory, the Poznan Ball Bearing Factory, and the Wroclaw Electric Engine Workshop.

　　集中使用建设投资　保证重要部门发展
　　波兰加快基本建设步伐
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰正在加快基本建设步伐。今年正在新建和扩建的大中型建设项目就有一千多个，而最大型的工业建设项目有四十个。全国各地基本建设工人正在为提前完成建设任务而积极热情地劳动。波兰今年在基本建设上采取了集中使用投资的办法，一大批建设项目将在今年内完成并投入生产，这将对下一个五年计划期间加速建设速度起重要作用。
    今年，波兰的基本建设投资总数达九百亿兹罗提，比去年的实际投资额增加了6.4％。今年基本建设的主要任务是要完成1956—1960
　年五年计划期间的基本建设任务，为下一个五年计划期间加速国民经济发展做好准备。所以今年的生产建设投资占全部投资总数的69％。基本建设投资主要用于对今后工农业生产的发展有重要意义的电力、冶金、化学等部门，以及用于兴建工业原料基地如煤矿、铜矿等。
    波兰目前正在兴建和扩建的有七个大型电站，预计今年全国发电能力将比去年增加六十二万多瓩。
    冶金工业的基本建设任务主要是继续扩大诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金厂和华沙优质钢厂。今年诺瓦胡塔的两座轧钢车间，一座钢管厂以及九号平炉将投入生产。华沙优质钢厂也将有两座平炉和一个钢锭车间投入生产，华沙优质钢厂的生产能力今年可提高到三十万吨。
    其它工业部门的许多大型厂矿也正在兴建和扩建，不久前波兰最大的普洛克石油加工厂已动工兴建，华沙近郊的乌尔苏斯拖拉机厂已动工扩建为年产三万六千台拖拉机的大型工厂。此外还有十一座煤井正在扩建和新建中，欧洲著名的图罗夫露天煤矿也正扩建中。
    波兰各地基本建设工人为庆祝波兰国庆十六周年（7月22日），提出保证，要在这一天以前提早完成建设任务，并将建设项目交付使用。预计在7月22日前投入生产的新工业项目将有罗兹建筑器材厂、维日比察水泥工厂、波兹南滚珠轴承厂和伏罗茨瓦夫电力引擎车间等。
