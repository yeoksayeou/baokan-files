    Shanghai Manufactures Agricultural Machinery and Pesticides to Support Agriculture
    Over one hundred machinery and chemical factories in Shanghai are implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and vigorously supporting agricultural production. In the first half of this year, the quantity of various mechanical equipment manufactured by Shanghai for rural areas has greatly exceeded that of previous years. Among them, the output of water pumps used for drought resistance and drainage for rural areas has more than doubled the total output of last year. More than 1,000 small threshing machines, rice milling machines, hulling machines, and feed pulverizers manufactured by various factories for rural areas have begun to be shipped to various places successively. The output of pesticide equipment such as agricultural spraying and dusting combined machines and double-wheeled three-purpose machines produced by factories under the Chemical Industry Bureau in the first five months of this year increased by one to more than ten times compared with the same period last year. Since the beginning of this year, the Chemical Industry Bureau has cooperated with seven or eighty small chemical factories in eleven nearby counties to help them master the production technology of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
    
    Jiangxi Light Industry Actively Reserves Raw Materials
    The broad masses of workers on the light industry front in Jiangxi Province are actively storing "food and grass" for the leap forward in the third quarter. As early as mid-May, the Light Industry Department and the Commerce Department transferred more than 120 cadres to form four working groups, which went deep into the mountainous areas to carry out a mass movement to vigorously develop wild and miscellaneous fibers. At present, more than 77,000 dan of wild and miscellaneous fibers have been collected. Oil factories, chemical factories, etc., have solved the shortage of raw materials and increased the variety of products by vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization and diversified management. Industries such as ceramics, wine making, sugar refining, matches, and paper making have established raw material bases in nearby mines, mountains, and communes.

    Shenyang Achieves Circular Water Supply Throughout the City
    Shenyang has greatly promoted the revolution in urban water supply methods and achieved a "circular water supply" system. This has transformed the urban water supply from a fragmented, single-line system to a city-wide network of interconnected pipes, greatly tapping the potential of water supply.
    
    In the past, Shenyang's water supply method followed the methods left over from the old society, that is, one water source was only responsible for supplying one area and was not connected with other areas. Therefore, areas with many water sources and large water volume could not use it all, while neighboring areas with large water consumption could not fully meet their needs. The implementation of circular water supply can fundamentally change this situation.

    Mianyang Prefecture Vigorously Promotes Comprehensive Utilization of Coal and Coke
    Mianyang Prefecture in Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of coal and coke and is vigorously developing small indigenous oil groups, which has led to the rapid development of the synthetic petroleum industry. At present, more than 200 indigenous coke ovens in the area have basically achieved "oil extraction must be carried out during coking." At the same time, fifteen synthetic petroleum factories (workshops) have been set up in a simple and economical way. From January to June, the production of crude oil increased more than six times compared with the same period last year, and a large amount of gasoline, diesel, asphalt, lubricating oil, and other products were refined, which strongly supported the needs of industrial and agricultural production and transportation.

    Long Dragon Runs on the Tibetan Plateau
    Zhou Zuoyin and Li Bingnan, drivers of the Third Team of the Tibet Transportation Bureau, boldly adopted trailer transportation on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, completing this year's national plan seven months ahead of schedule. They broke the saying that trailer transportation could not be implemented on the Tibetan Plateau, and created a new record of more than 40,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month on the Tibetan Plateau.
    
    The gasoline saved by the two of them can supply a fully loaded Liberation truck to travel 10,000 kilometers.

    要闻快报
    上海制造农械农药支援农业
    上海市一百多家机械、化工工厂贯彻以农业为基础的方针，大力支援农业生产。今年上半年，上海为各地农村制造的各种机械设备，数量都大大超过往年，其中供给农村抗旱排涝用的水泵的产量，已超过去年全年总产量一倍多。各厂为农村制造的一千多台小型脱谷机、碾米机、砻谷机、饲料粉碎机，都已开始陆续运往各地。化学工业局所属的工厂，今年头五个月所生产的农业喷雾喷粉联合机、双轮三用机等杀虫器械，产量和去年同期相比，分别增长了一倍到十多倍。化学工业局今年以来和附近十一个县的七、八十个小化工厂挂钩协作，帮助他们掌握化肥、农药的生产技术。
    江西轻工业积极储备原料
    江西省轻工业战线广大职工，积极为第三季度储备跃进“粮草”。早在5月中旬，轻工业厅和商业厅就抽调了一百二十多名干部，组成四个工作组，深入山区，开展大搞野杂纤维的群众运动，目前已收集到野杂纤维七万七千多担。油脂厂、化工厂等由于大搞综合利用和多种经营，解决了原料的不足，增加了产品品种。陶瓷、酿酒、制糖、火柴、造纸等工业都在附近的矿、山、公社建立了原料基地。
    沈阳全市实现环形供水
    沈阳市大搞城市供水方法的革命，实现了自来水“环形供水”，使城市供水由分片单线的供水方法，变成全市管管相连、环环相套的环形供水网，大大挖掘了供水潜力。
    过去，沈阳市的供水方法，是沿袭旧社会遗留下来的方法，即一个水源只负责供应一个地区，与其它地区互无联系。因此水源多、水量大的地区用不了，邻近地区因用水量大，又不能充分满足需要。实行环形供水，就可以从根本上改变这种情况。
    绵阳专区大搞煤焦综合利用
    四川绵阳专区大搞煤焦综合利用，大办石油小土群，使人造石油工业获得了迅速的发展。目前，全区二百多座土焦窑已基本上做到“炼焦必须取油”。同时，又因陋就简地办起了十五座人造石油厂（车间），1月至6月生产的原油比去年同期增长了六倍多，并炼制出大量的汽油、柴油、沥青、润滑油等多种产品，有力地支援了工农业生产和交通运输的需要。
    西藏高原走长龙
    西藏运输局汽车三队驾驶员周祚胤和李炳南，在青藏公路上大胆采用拖挂运输，提前七个月完成了今年国家计划，打破了西藏高原不能实行挂拖斗运输的说法，创造了西藏高原车吨月产四万多吨公里的新纪录。
    他们二人节约的汽油，可供一辆解放牌汽车满载行驶一万公里。
