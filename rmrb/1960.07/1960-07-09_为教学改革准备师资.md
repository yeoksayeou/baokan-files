    Preparing Teachers for Teaching Reform
    Xiao Bai
    Teaching reform is unfolding across the country. This is a class struggle in the field of education to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and it also contains the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, the correct and the erroneous. This is a profound revolution. Whether we can guarantee the victorious progress of the teaching reform struggle and further improve the quality of education depends on one key issue: rapidly improving the political, cultural, and professional levels of in-service teachers.
    Currently, Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu, Henan, and other provinces are focusing on the training and improvement of primary and secondary school teachers in preparation for teaching reform, creating a high tide of in-service study for primary and secondary school teachers. This is an important measure to ensure the victorious progress of teaching reform.
    "Educators must first be educated." To develop education, improve the quality of education, and carry out teaching reform, teachers are the "vanguard." Teaching reform is carried out under the leadership of the Party and relies on teachers. If teachers' minds are not armed first, and if the teachers' ranks are not well-trained first, the victory of teaching reform cannot be guaranteed. All teachers must deeply understand the importance and necessity of teaching reform, be promoters of teaching reform, be brave in innovation and creation, be courageous in overcoming difficulties, work steadily and diligently, and consciously and actively participate in teaching reform work. Judging from the current situation of teaching reform in primary and secondary schools, the changes in many subject systems, the increase of modern science and technology knowledge in textbooks, and the gradual decentralization of some subjects have all put forward new and higher requirements for teachers. We must take practical and effective measures to rapidly improve the political, cultural, and professional levels of in-service teachers in order to meet the urgent needs of teaching reform. Therefore, educational administrative departments at all levels and school leaders must pay serious attention to the work of training and improving teachers and immediately take it up, so that all teachers can quickly launch a high tide of in-service study for teaching reform.
    To train and improve in-service teachers, we must walk on two legs, combining long-term training with short-term training, combining in-service training with off-the-job study, combining systematic improvement with filling in the gaps, and combining self-study, rotational training, and correspondence courses in flexible and diverse ways, and achieve learning and teaching simultaneously, with "rising tides lifting all boats." When training teachers, their study time must be fully guaranteed.
    Now, the summer vacation is approaching. In order to meet the urgent requirements of teaching reform, especially the needs of the large-scale experiments with new school systems this year, Party committees at all levels, in addition to focusing on teachers' daily in-service study, should also use the vacation for some short-term training, while ensuring that teachers have a certain amount of rest time, to help teachers better undertake the new tasks of teaching reform in the next semester. This work must be started immediately in order to better prepare teachers for teaching reform.

    为教学改革准备师资
    萧柏
    教学改革正在全国各地展开。这是教学领域中兴无灭资的阶级斗争，同时也包含着先进和保守、正确和谬误的斗争。这是一场深刻的革命。能不能保证教学改革这场斗争的胜利进行，和教育质量的进一步提高，其中一个关键问题，就是迅速提高在职教师的政治、文化和业务水平。
    目前，江苏、河南等省各级党委为了准备进行教学改革，大抓中、小学教师的培训提高工作，掀起了中、小学教师的进修学习高潮，这是保证教学改革胜利进行的重要措施。
    “教育者必须首先受教育”。发展教育事业，提高教育质量，进行教学改革，师资是“先行官”。教学改革是在党的领导下，依靠教师来进行的，教师的思想如果不先武装起来，教师的队伍如果不先练好兵，教学改革的胜利是不能得到保证的。全体教师都必须深刻认识教学改革的重要性和必要性，做教学改革的促进派，勇于革新创造，勇于克服困难，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，自觉地积极参加教学改革工作。根据目前中、小学教学改革的情况来看，教学改革中许多学科体系的改变，教材中现代科学技术知识的增加，部分学科的逐级下放，都向教师提出了新的更高的要求。必须采取切实有效的措施，迅速提高在职教师的政治、文化、业务水平，才能适应教学改革的迫切需要。因此，各级教育行政部门以及学校领导上，都要对培训提高教师的工作，认真重视，并立即抓起来，使全体教师迅速掀起一个为教学改革而进修学习的高潮。
    培训提高在职教师，必须两条腿走路，采取长期培养和短期训练相结合，在职进修和离职学习相结合，系统提高和缺啥补啥相结合，自学、轮训、函授相结合等灵活多样的方法，并做到边学边教，“水涨船高”。在培训教师的时候，教师的学习时间，一定要给予充分的保证。
    现在，暑假就快要到了，为了适应教学改革的迫切要求，特别是今年各地大量试验新学制的需要，各地党委除了要抓紧教师们的日常进修学习以外，还要在保证教师有一定休息时间的前提下，利用假期进行一些短期训练，以帮助教师们更好地担负起下学期教学改革的新任务。这项工作要立即着手进行，才能为教学改革更好地做好师资准备工作。
