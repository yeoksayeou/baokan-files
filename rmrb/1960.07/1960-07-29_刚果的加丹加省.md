    The Congo is one of the world's countries with extremely rich mineral resources, and is known as the "Gem of Central Africa." The vast majority of the Congo's mineral deposits are concentrated in Katanga Province. Of the Congo's six provinces, 80 percent of the mineral production is concentrated in Katanga's approximately 800,000 square kilometers of land. Katanga's uranium production accounts for 60 percent of the entire capitalist world, cobalt accounts for 75 percent, industrial diamonds account for 80 percent, tin accounts for 10 percent, and copper accounts for 8 percent. Its germanium production is also the highest in the world. In addition, there are deposits of zinc, radium, aluminum, silver, manganese, platinum, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, and more.
    These mineral deposits in Katanga are mainly controlled by the "Union Minière du Haut-Katanga," operated by foreign monopoly capital. Sixty percent of its shares belong to Belgium, while the remainder is controlled by the United States and Britain. This company completely monopolizes the mining of copper, cobalt, and uranium in the Congo, and also holds shares in more than 30 enterprises in other mines, agriculture, and trade. It also controls more than 53 percent of the Congo's railways and 87 percent of its electricity, controlling the Congo's main economic lifeline. The company's profits are staggering. From 1950 to 1955 alone, its profits reached more than 28 billion Belgian francs (50 francs equal one US dollar); while its capital during this period did not exceed 5 billion Belgian francs. Through this company, the United States controls the Congo's various uranium mines, transporting almost all of the uranium ore to the United States. Belgium transports most of the Congo's industrial raw materials such as copper, zinc, and aluminum to Belgium; Britain also plunders a portion of it.
    The so-called "independence" announced this time by Katanga Province Governor Tshombe is a political conspiracy to split the Congo, concocted single-handedly by international monopoly capital. (Pull)

    刚果的加丹加省
    刚果是世界上矿藏极为丰富的国家之一，素有“中非宝石”之称。刚果的绝大部分矿藏都蕴藏在加丹加省。在刚果的六个省中，百分之八十的矿产量集中在加丹加的约八十万平方公里的土地上。加丹加的铀产量占整个资本主义世界的百分之六十，钴占百分之七十五，工业钻石占百分之八十，锡占百分之十，铜占百分之八。锗的产量也是世界第一。此外还有锌、镭、铝、银、锰、铂、钨、钽、铌等等矿藏。
    加丹加的这些矿藏主要被控制在外国垄断资本经营的“上加丹加矿业联合公司”。它的百分之六十股金属于比利时，其余被美英分别控制。这家公司完全垄断了刚果的铜、钴、铀的开采，还在其他矿山、农业、贸易等方面握有三十多个企业的股权，并且掌握刚果百分之五十三以上的铁路和百分之八十七的电力，控制着刚果的主要经济命脉。这家公司利润惊人，仅一九五○年到一九五五年间，所获利润就达二百八十亿多比利时法郎（五十法郎合一美元）；而它的资本在这个时期却没有超过五十亿比利时法郎。通过这一公司，美国控制了刚果的各个铀矿，把几乎全部铀矿砂运往美国。比利时则把刚果绝大部分铜、锌、铝等工业原料运往比利时；英国也掠夺其中的一部分。
    这次加丹加省省长冲伯宣布的所谓“独立”，就是国际垄断资本所一手制造的分裂刚果的政治阴谋。（拔）
