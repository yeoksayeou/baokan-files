Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th: The ship "Russia," which is responsible for bringing overseas Chinese back to the country, arrived in Zhanjiang on the afternoon of the 24th, carrying a group of impoverished overseas Chinese from Jakarta and Belitung, Indonesia. Accompanying the ship were the ashes of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, who were killed by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia, as well as the victims' families and relatives.

During their return voyage, these returned overseas Chinese also held a memorial service on board for the two deceased compatriots.

When the returned overseas Chinese arrived in Zhanjiang, Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, Wang Yuanxing, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of Guangdong Province, Nong Jian, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and more than 500 representatives from local returned overseas Chinese and various circles, welcomed them at the dock.

After disembarking, the returned overseas Chinese and more than 1,500 people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City held a ceremony to welcome the ashes of the two victims. The atmosphere at the venue was solemn and sorrowful. Wreaths from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and other units were placed beside the altar where the ashes of the deceased were placed. At the meeting, Zhong Qingfa, on behalf of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, expressed deep condolences to the two innocent Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, who were killed, and extended cordial condolences to their families. He said: The killing of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang has aroused great indignation among the people of the motherland and the vast number of overseas Chinese. The Chinese and Indonesian people have a profound friendship. In the anti-imperialist struggle, the people of the two countries have always supported each other. However, a small handful of reactionary elements hostile to the friendly relations between China and Indonesia have repeatedly conspired to stir up trouble and carry out various anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, attempting to undermine the unity and cooperation between the two peoples. We want to solemnly warn the small handful of malicious elements in Indonesia that the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people will last forever and cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces. He also expressed his hope that the Indonesian government can actively remove obstacles and work together with the Chinese government to seek a comprehensive and reasonable solution to the issue of overseas Chinese existing between our two countries through friendly consultation.

Lin Xiulan, the eldest daughter of Ye Jinniang, Lin Bingwang, the second son, and Lin Limei, the niece of Yang Mumei, rushed to Zhanjiang from Tianjin, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, respectively, to welcome the ashes of their relatives. Lin Bingwang spoke at the meeting on behalf of the families of the victimized overseas Chinese. He expressed his utmost indignation at the bloody atrocities deliberately created by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia. He also sincerely thanked the Party, the government, the people of the motherland, and overseas compatriots for their care, support, and condolences.

    一批贫苦华侨回到湛江
    杨木妹和叶金娘的骨灰运回祖国 
    各界人民举行迎接两位死难者骨灰的仪式
    据新华社广州25日电　接运华侨回国的轮船——俄罗斯号，从印度尼西亚雅加达和勿里洞接回一批贫苦华侨，于24日下午抵湛江。随同这条船回来的有遭到印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害的杨木妹、叶金娘的骨灰和死难者的家属和亲戚。
    这批归侨在返国途中，还在船上为两位死难同胞举行了追悼会。
    这批归侨抵达湛江时，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室主任钟庆发和广东省华侨事务委员会副主任王源兴、广西僮族自治区人民委员会副秘书长农健等，和当地归国华侨以及各界代表五百多人，到码头上欢迎。
    归侨登岸后，和湛江市各界人民共一千五百多人举行了迎接两位死难者骨灰的仪式。会场上充满严肃沉痛的气氛，在安放死难者骨灰瓮的灵台旁边，置放着华侨事务委员会等单位敬挽的花圈。钟庆发在会上代表中华人民共和国接待和安置归侨委员会对两位被无辜杀害的杨木妹、叶金娘侨胞致以沉痛哀悼，并向她们的家属致亲切的慰问。他说：杨木妹和叶金娘的被杀害，激起了祖国人民和广大华侨极大的愤慨。中国人民和印度尼西亚人民有着深厚的友谊。在反帝斗争中，两国人民从来都是互相支援的。但是，一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友好关系的反动分子，一再阴谋挑起事端，进行各种反华排华活动，企图破坏两国人民的团结合作。我们要正告印度尼西亚一小撮别有用心的分子，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊万古长存，是任何反动势力破坏不了的。他还表示希望印度尼西亚政府能够积极地排除障碍，同中国政府共同努力，通过友好协商求得存在我们两国之间的华侨问题的全面、合理的解决。
    叶金娘长女林秀兰、次子林秉旺和杨木妹的侄女林丽妹，分别从天津、福州、厦门赶来湛江，迎接亲属骨灰。林秉旺在会上代表受害侨胞家属讲话。他对于印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局蓄意制造的血腥暴行，表示十二万分的愤慨。他并且衷心感激党、政府、祖国人民和国外侨胞给予他们的关怀、支持和慰问。
