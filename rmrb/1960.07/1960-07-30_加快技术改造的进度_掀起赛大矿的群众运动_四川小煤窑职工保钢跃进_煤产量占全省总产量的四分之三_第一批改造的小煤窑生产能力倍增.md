    Chengdu, July 29th (People's Daily) - The broad masses of small coal mine workers in Sichuan Province are launching a mass movement of small mines competing with large mines to ensure increased steel production. From January to June, raw coal produced by small coal mines accounted for 76.64% of the province's total output, an increase of 34.15% over the same period last year. The province's raw coal production plan for the first half of the year was overfulfilled. Since entering July, the production situation has been even better. Statistics from July 1st to 25th show that the average daily output of raw coal has increased by 28.6% compared to June.

    The tens of thousands of small coal mines that developed during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 are an important force on Sichuan's coal industry front. They directly shoulder the responsibility of supplying the numerous small steelmaking "native furnaces" and the coal needs of county and commune industries, agricultural technical transformation, and the broad urban areas. Therefore, vigorously transforming and improving small coal mines has become a central link in the coal industry. At the beginning of this year, Sichuan Province's coal industry departments adopted the method of grasping typical examples and setting up pace-setters, mobilizing the broad masses of small coal mine workers to launch a mass movement of small mines competing with large mines, and focusing on the technical transformation of small coal mines. Currently, many small coal mines have caught up with or surpassed the level of large mines in several aspects. The province's high-yield red banner for small coal mines - Tongxing Coal Mine - averaged a daily output of 2,196 tons of raw coal in June, with all-employee efficiency reaching more than five tons, and the cost per ton of coal dropping to 0.9 yuan.

    The technical transformation of small coal mines in various parts of Sichuan has first and foremost adhered to the principles of "primarily native methods, combining native and foreign methods, making do with whatever is available, using local materials, supplementing what is lacking, and self-reliance." Because the direction was clear, and the path of "from small to large, from native to foreign, from simple to complex, and gradually improving" was adhered to from beginning to end, the difficulties of lacking materials, equipment, and technical strength were effectively overcome, and the transformation progress was greatly accelerated. The vast majority of the first batch of 120 transformed small coal mines across the province transitioned from small "native furnaces" to small "modern furnaces" in just half a year, with annual production capacity generally increasing by 100% to 167%. Tongxing Coal Mine in Yongchuan County, Jiangjin Prefecture, utilized natural conditions in its technical transformation, creating various native machines and native equipment, and achieving "Nine Natives" (native winches, native fans, native water pumps, native batteries, native coal unloading platforms, native coal sieves, native coal crushers, native detonators, native explosives) and "Ten Automations" (hoisting winch automation, ventilation mechanization, lighting battery automation, coal discharge hopper automation, transportation rail automation, coal unloading automation, air door automation, coal mining heavy hammer [likely a typo, should be 锤子] automation, coal selection sieve automation, coal washing wooden trough automation). Within a few months, personnel was reduced by half, and output tripled. After the experience of Tongxing Coal Mine was widely promoted in more than 200 small coal mines in this prefecture, the entire prefecture quickly and comprehensively realized native mechanization and native automation in the main production links such as recovery, tunneling, hoisting, ventilation, drainage, crushing, screening, and transportation, eliminating manual labor. Up to now, the entire prefecture has manufactured more than 1,000 various native machines and more than 20,000 various advanced tools, reducing the number of employees by 50% and increasing output by 200%.

    In the transformation, small coal mines in various places also closely combined with current production, achieving simultaneous production, transformation, and improvement, and promoting continuous leaps in production.

    In strengthening the leadership of the transformation of small coal mines, the Party committees at all levels in Sichuan Province, in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive transformation and key improvement," unified planning, carried out transformation in batches and stages, concentrated manpower and material resources to focus on key points, transformed one batch well and then transformed another batch, thus achieving immediate results. At the same time, for mines with abundant resources, excellent coal quality, convenient transportation, and serving large enterprises, especially iron and steel enterprises, hoisting, ventilation, drainage, power, mining, transportation, and other equipment were also prioritized to rapidly improve their production capacity. For general scattered small coal mines, focusing on the distribution of steel mills, the transformation was carried out in accordance with the requirements of complete sets of blast furnaces, mines, and coal coking small "modern furnaces" and networking of transportation between the three groups, implementing counterpart supply, thus effectively guaranteeing the high-speed development needs of industrial production with steel as the key link.

### 加快技术改造的进度　掀起赛大矿的群众运动  四川小煤窑职工保钢跃进  煤产量占全省总产量的四分之三　第一批改造的小煤窑生产能力倍增

    加快技术改造的进度　掀起赛大矿的群众运动
    四川小煤窑职工保钢跃进
    煤产量占全省总产量的四分之三　第一批改造的小煤窑生产能力倍增
    本报成都29日电　四川省广大小煤窑职工掀起小矿赛大矿的群众运动，确保钢铁增产。1月至6月份小煤窑所产原煤占全省总产量的76.64％，比去年同期增长34.15％。全省上半年原煤生产计划超额完成。进入7月份以来，生产形势更好，7月1日至25日统计，原煤平均日产量比6月份又增长28.6％。
    1958年大跃进中发展起来的上万个小煤窑，是四川煤炭工业战线上的一支重要力量，它直接担负着供应为数众多的钢铁小洋群和县、社工业、农业技术改造和广大城镇用煤的需要。因此，大力改造和提高小煤窑，便成为煤炭工业的一个中心环节。今年一开始，四川省煤炭工业部门就采取抓典型、树标兵的方法，发动广大小煤窑职工开展小矿赛大矿的群众运动，狠抓小煤窑的技术改造。目前，许多小煤窑已经在若干方面赶上或超过了大矿的水平。全省小煤窑高产红旗——同兴煤矿，6月份平均日产原煤二千一百九十六吨，全员工效达到五吨以上，每吨煤成本降到零点九元。
    四川各地对小煤窑的技术改造，首先坚持了“以土为主、土洋结合、因陋就简、就地取材、缺啥补啥、自力更生”的方针。由于方向明确，并自始至终地坚持了“由小到大、由土到洋、由简到繁、逐步提高”的道路，因而有力地克服了材料、设备缺乏和技术力量不足等困难，大大加快了改造进度。全省第一批改造的一百二十个小煤窑，仅花半年时间，大部分都由小土群过渡到小洋群，年产能力普遍提高一倍至一点六七倍。江津专区永川县同兴煤矿，在技术改造中因地制宜利用自然条件，创造了多种土机械、土设备，实现了“九土”（土绞车、土风机、土水泵、土电瓶、土卸煤台、土溜煤筛、土碎煤机、土雷管、土炸药）、“十化”（提升绞车化、通风机械化、照明电瓶化、放煤梭斗化、运输轨道化、卸煤自动化、风门自动化、采煤重头?子化、选煤溜筛化、洗煤木槽化），几个月内人员就减少一半，产量翻了三番。这个专区的二百多个小煤窑普遍推广了同兴煤矿的经验后，很快就在回采、掘进、提升、通风、排水、破碎、筛选、运输等主要生产环节上全面实现了土机械化和土自动化，消除了人背肩挑的体力劳动。到目前为止，全专区共制造了各种土机械一千多台，各种先进工具两万多件，职工人数减少了50％，产量提高了两倍。
    各地小煤窑在改造中，还紧密地结合当前生产，做到边生产、边改造、边提高，推动生产不断跃进。
    四川省各级党委在加强小煤窑改造的领导工作中，按照“全面改造，重点提高”的原则，统一规划，分期分批地进行改造，集中人力物力突击重点，改好一批再改一批，因而收到立竿见影的效果。同时，对于资源丰富，煤质优良，交通方便而又为大型企业、特别是钢铁企业服务的矿井，还重点地配备了提升、通风、排水、动力、采煤、运输等设备，使其迅速提高生产能力；对于一般分散的小煤窑，则围绕钢铁布点，按照高炉、矿山、煤焦小洋群三群成套、三群之间运输成网的要求进行改造，实行对口供应，因此有力地保证了以钢为纲的工业生产高速度发展的需要。
