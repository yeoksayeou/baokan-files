Column: Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Listening to the Party's words, we will be invincible
    Xiao Hua, First Secretary of the CPC Chuxian County Committee, Anhui Province

    Listening to the Party in all our work makes us invincible and indestructible; otherwise, we will achieve nothing. Countless facts in our revolutionary struggle have demonstrated this truth.

    The Fan Ying Production Team branch of the Chudong Commune in our county is a relatively outstanding branch in resolutely implementing the Party's work tasks. They firmly believe in the Party, rely closely on the Party's leadership, and no matter when or how great the difficulties they encounter, they always unswervingly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and do everything possible to complete the tasks assigned by the Party without compromise. Because the Party branch exemplarily implements the Party's instructions and resolutions, a fine style has also been formed among the commune members: everyone listens to the Party's words, and they go wherever the Party directs them to work. Therefore, all work always starts early, ends quickly, is proactive in everything, and moves forward step by step. The political enthusiasm of all team members is very high.

    The Fan Ying Production Team of the Gao Ying Brigade in the Chudong Commune is located on the hillside of Huangdao Mountain in Chuxian County, with a raised middle and low surroundings, undulating hills, and barren land. It is a well-known poor team in the county. The team has 1,600 mu of land, but only 110 laborers, with each person bearing an average of more than 14 mu of cultivated land. The extreme lack of labor, livestock, and farm tools has led to extensive cultivation and low yields. After the cooperativization and communization, the production conditions and living standards have improved year by year. The old houses have been renovated, 82 new houses have been built, the number of cattle has reached 37, and new and improved farm tools have been widely used. Grain production has also increased rapidly. Last year, despite a hundred days of severe drought, the autumn harvest still saw the sale of more than 66,000 jin of surplus grain. This year, the summer harvest quota of 44,000 jin was completed ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 50,000 jin.

    Why has the Fan Ying Production Team been able to change its impoverished and backward conditions in such a short period? The main reason is that they have been able to resolutely implement the Party's guidelines and policies and complete various work tasks without compromise. Last year, when the commune Party committee deployed drought resistance measures, the branch resolutely accepted the task of fighting the drought. In the first one or two months, they carried out water diversion and water lifting. After the third month, all the water on the ground, whether in reservoirs or large ponds, was completely pumped dry. There were no major rivers nearby, and the drought continued to worsen. At this time, the commune Party committee put forward the slogan of "asking the land for water and fighting for grain against the sky." Although the branch was not sure whether underground water could be found on the high hills, it still organized commune members to dig wells to fight the drought without hesitation. At the beginning, five wells were dug in a row without water, and many commune members became discouraged. The brigade's general branch, based on the serious situation at the time, held fourteen Party member meetings in a row, earnestly studying the county Party committee's opinions on the drought resistance struggle. All the Party members of the Fan Ying branch expressed their determination to fight the drought to the end. Yu Daofeng, the branch secretary, on the one hand, mobilized all commune members to dig a well each, and on the other hand, personally led six commune members to find water sources, dig earthen wells, and visit old farmers day and night. They searched for three days and nights, and as a result, they found a lot of green grass at the bottom of the reservoir and the mud ponds. They analyzed that there must be a water source under the green grass, and immediately organized commune members to dig wells. Sure enough, the first well found water after digging only six feet deep. Therefore, they expanded the area of the earthen well and dug it into a curved trench shape, which greatly increased the water intake surface, and all 63 mu of rice fields nearby were saved. Because they resolutely listened to the Party's words and persevered in their determination to fight the drought to the end, they finally overcame the unprecedented severe drought on the high hills after 130 days without rain.

    In the Fan Ying Production Team, everyone has a very clear ideal, which is to catch up with the richest team in the entire commune as soon as possible from being a poor team. This ideal has become the material force for the branch to mobilize the masses and implement the Party's work tasks, and has cultivated the commune members' communist labor consciousness. At the beginning of communization, although the team had greatly improved in production and life, it was still a poor team compared to the richest areas in the entire commune. Therefore, a few commune members thought that since the land had become collectively owned after communization, it would be better to move out, thinking that moving anywhere would be better than staying in this poor mountain nest. At that time, the county Party committee put forward the slogan of "poor teams catching up with rich teams." The brigade's general branch organized all commune members to study, and through recollection and comparison, everyone realized that only self-reliance and creating a socialist happy life was the only way out. Therefore, the slogan of "poor teams catching up with rich teams" gave all commune members unlimited confidence and encouragement. In the past, the production team only had some small mountain ponds, which were subject to drought every year. In the past year or so, they have given full play to the superiority of communization, built three reservoirs, and basically solved the water needs of the paddy fields. The thinness of the soil is also the most prominent root cause of poverty in this team's production. In the past year or so, the production team has adopted active measures such as multiple plowing, deep plowing, soil fumigation, and fertilization. Therefore, the soil of most of the land has begun to improve. The Fan Ying Production Team's Party branch has become a strong fortress for implementing the Party's policies. This grassroots fighting organization is leading the masses to move towards the bright road of communism in accordance with the direction pointed out by the Party.

    听党的话，无往不胜
    中共安徽滁县县委第一书记　萧华
    一切工作，听党的话，就无往不胜，无坚不摧，否则就会一事无成。在我们的革命斗争中，无数的事实说明了这样一个真理。
    我县滁东公社范郢生产队支部，在坚决执行党的工作任务中是一个比较出色的支部。他们坚决相信党，紧紧地依靠党的领导，不论在什么时候，不管遇到多大的困难，对党的方针政策总是坚定不移地去贯彻执行，千方百计不折不扣地完成党交给的任务。因为党支部模范地执行党的指示和决议，在社员群众中也形成了这样一种优良作风：人人听党的话，党指到哪里，他们就到哪里干。因而各项工作，总是开始得早，结束得快，事事主动，步步提前。全队的社员，政治情绪非常饱满。
    滁东公社高郢大队范郢生产队，在滁县皇道山半腰的岗地上，中部隆起，四周低陷，丘陵起伏，土地贫瘠，是全县有名的穷队。全队一千六百亩土地，只有一百一十个劳动力，每人平均负担耕地十四亩以上。劳畜力和农具的极度缺乏，形成了耕作粗放，广种薄收。经过合作化和公社化以后，生产条件和生活面貌逐年改善，旧房子都进行了翻修，新房子盖了八十二间，耕牛达到三十七头，普遍使用了新式农具和改良农具，粮食产量也迅速提高。去年在百日大旱的情况下，秋季仍然出售余粮六万六千多斤，今年午季四万四千斤征购任务，又提前超额完成了五万斤。
    范郢生产队为什么能够在短短的时间内，改变贫困落后的面貌呢？主要是因为他们能够坚决执行党的方针政策，不折不扣地完成各项工作任务。去年，公社党委布置抗旱时，支部坚决地接受了抗旱斗争的任务。开始一、二个月，进行了放水和车水，到第三个月以后，不论水库、大塘，凡是地面上的水，全部车干。周围没有大河，旱情又不断发展。这时公社党委提出了向地要水、与天争粮的号召，支部虽然对山岗高地能不能挖到地下水还没有把握，但是仍然毫不犹豫地组织社员打井抗旱。开始一连挖了五口井都没有水，不少社员泄了气。大队总支根据当时的严重情况，连续召开了十四次党员大会，认真学习了县委关于抗旱斗争的意见。范郢支部的全体党员个个表示了抗旱到底的决心。支部书记余道凤一方面发动全体社员每人挖一口井，一方面亲自带着六个社员，不分昼夜找水源，挖土井，访问老农。他们一连找了三昼夜，结果在水库和陷泥塘底里发现了不少青草。他们分析了青草地下必有水源的道理，立即组织社员挖井，果然第一口井只挖六尺多深就挖到了水，于是他们把土井的面积扩大，挖成了弯弯曲曲的壕沟形，因此进水面很大，使附近六十三亩水稻全部保住了。由于他们坚决听党的话，百折不回地坚持了抗旱到底的决心，终于在一百三十天不雨的情况下，在高山岗地上仍然战胜了历史上从未有过的特大旱灾。
    在范郢生产队里，人人都有非常明确的理想，这理想就是把自己由穷队尽快地赶上全社最富的富队。这种理想，变成了支部发动群众、贯彻党的工作任务的物质力量，养成了社员们共产主义劳动的自觉性。在开始公社化时，这个队虽然在生产和生活上有了很大的提高，但是和全公社最富裕的地区比较起来，仍然还是一个穷队。因此少数社员以为公社化了，土地已经变为集体所有了，不如搬家外迁的好，认为搬到哪里都比这个穷山窝里要强得多。当时，县委提出了穷队赶富队的号召，大队总支组织全体社员进行了学习，通过回忆对比，大家认识到只有自力更生，创造社会主义的幸福生活，才是唯一的出路。因此穷队赶富队的号召，给了全体社员以无限的信心和鼓舞力量。过去生产队只有一些小山塘，年年受旱，一年多来，他们发挥了公社化的优越性，兴修了三座水库，基本上解决了水田用水量的需要。土质的瘦薄，也是这个队生产上最突出的穷根子。一年多来，生产队采取了多耕、深耕、熏土、施肥等积极措施，因此大部分土地的土壤已开始改良。范郢生产队党支部成为贯彻执行党的政策的一个坚强堡垒。这个基层的战斗组织正在领导群众按照党所指出的方向，走向共产主义的光明大道。
