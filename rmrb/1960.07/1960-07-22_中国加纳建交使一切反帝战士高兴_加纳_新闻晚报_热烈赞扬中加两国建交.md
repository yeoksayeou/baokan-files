Xinhua News Agency, London, July 19th: Accra dispatch: Ghana's "Evening News" published an editorial today, warmly praising the decision of China and Ghana to establish diplomatic relations. It said, "The development of diplomatic relations between Ghana and China will please all anti-imperialist fighters around the world, not only because the relationship between Asia and Africa will be closer as a result, but also because the way has now been paved for expanding trade and cultural relations."

The newspaper continued, "China today exports machinery for the development of industry and agriculture. And from the perspective of our foreign trade, China can gradually become one of our best customers. Its technicians can play an active role in accelerating the development of our planned economy."

The newspaper said, "The more than 650 million Chinese people who are fighting colonialism are still denied their rightful seat in the United Nations." The newspaper believes this is an imperialist conspiracy.

The newspaper also wrote, "We hope that when our President visits Beijing, he will not only bring the good wishes of the Ghanaian people, but also the good wishes of people in other parts of free Africa, as well as Africans across the continent and beyond who oppose imperialism. Long live the friendship and cooperation between China and Ghana."

    中国加纳建交使一切反帝战士高兴
    加纳“新闻晚报”热烈赞扬中加两国建交
    新华社伦敦19日电　阿克拉消息：加纳“新闻晚报”今天发表社论，热烈赞扬中国和加纳两国决定建立外交关系。它说，“加纳和中国之间外交关系的发展将使全世界一切反帝战士感到高兴，这不仅是因为亚洲和非洲的关系将因此更为密切，而且也是因为现在已为扩大贸易和文化关系铺平了道路。”
    这家报纸继续说，“中国今天出口供发展工农业用的机器。而从我们的对外贸易的角度来看，中国能够逐渐成为我们最好的顾客之一。它的技术人员能够对加速我们的计划经济的发展起积极的作用。”
    这家报纸说，“对殖民主义进行斗争的六亿五千多万中国人民仍然被拒绝在联合国取得正当的席位。”报纸认为这是帝国主义的阴谋。
    这家报纸还写道，“我们希望，当我们的总统访问北京的时候，他不仅带去加纳人民的良好愿望，而且还带去自由非洲其他各地人民以及非洲大陆各地和大陆以外反对帝国主义的非洲人的良好愿望。中国和加纳之间的友谊和合作万岁。”
