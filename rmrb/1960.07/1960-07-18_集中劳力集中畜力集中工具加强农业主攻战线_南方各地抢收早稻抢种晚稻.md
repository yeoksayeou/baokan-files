    Concentrate Labor, Livestock, and Tools to Strengthen the Main Agricultural Front:
　　Southern Regions Rush to Harvest Early Rice and Plant Late Rice
　　Guangdong
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 17th: Guangdong is concentrating labor, livestock, and tools to carry out the summer harvest and planting. As of the 13th, the province had harvested 16.7 million mu of early rice. Regions with faster progress, such as Hainan Island, the Chao-Shan Plain, and the Pearl River Delta, have basically completed the early rice harvest and are now making every effort to rush the planting of late rice ahead of schedule.
    Recently, with the exception of Qin County, Dongxing, and Hepu in the Zhanjiang Special Zone, the weather has been good in most parts of the province, which is very beneficial for the summer harvest and planting. All regions have concentrated their efforts to strengthen the front line of the summer harvest and planting. A great situation has emerged with harvesting, threshing, plowing, and transplanting advancing simultaneously.
    In the rush to harvest, all regions have emphasized careful harvesting and threshing, striving to get every grain into the barn. Many communes have organized gleaning teams and re-threshing teams. The Shaoguan Special Zone has widely promoted the experience of using a "low-cutting sickle," which can yield an additional 20 to 30 jin of grain per mu.
    While rushing to harvest early rice, all regions are also vigorously plowing the fields, delivering water for transplanting, and ensuring simultaneous harvesting and plowing, harrowing and transplanting, practicing intensive cultivation and careful plowing, and deep plowing and thorough harrowing to ensure that late rice transplanting meets high standards and high quality. In the Foshan Special Zone, more than 75% of the harvested paddy fields have already been plowed. In the Jiangmen Special Zone, 2.4 million mu of the 3.4 million mu of harvested early rice have been plowed. As of the 13th, plowed paddy fields accounted for 70% of the harvested area in the province, and 3.12 million mu of late rice had been transplanted.
    During the harvest, all regions also combined harvesting with seed selection and retention, implementing simultaneous harvesting and selection, removing impurities and weeds, and ensuring that good seeds are harvested, dried, and threshed separately to ensure the purity of good seeds and lay the foundation for popularizing good seeds for next year's early season. The three special zones of Zhanjiang, Foshan, and Shantou have already selected more than 130 million jin of the excellent "Dwarf Foot Nantec" variety.
　　Guangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 17th: Guangxi has fully started harvesting early rice and early corn. Yulin and Wuzhou, where the season is earlier, have entered the busy harvest period, and other special zones are also starting to harvest one after another. At present, the entire autonomous region has harvested more than 1.52 million mu of early rice and 2.67 million mu of corn.
    Since the beginning of spring, Guangxi has experienced a prolonged drought with little rain. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of commune members have fully leveraged the superiority of the people's communes and waged a continuous battle against the drought. As a result, commune members cherish the matured grain even more. During the rush harvest, they are carefully harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain returns to the barn. As soon as the rush harvest began in Cenxi, Cangwu, and other counties, they ensured that grain buckets were enclosed and rice stalks were padded. At the same time, they adopted a method of continuous inspection and mutual supervision involving harvesting, threshing, transportation, and drying to prevent any grain from being scattered and wasted. Dongping Commune in Bobai County launched a competition to "harvest 30 to 50 jin more grain per mu," striving for a bumper harvest and issuing a proposal to the Yulin Special Zone. Subsequently, Yulin, Guixian, Pingnan, and other places responded to the proposal, and communes and teams formulated conventions for careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring gentle cutting, gentle placement, gentle carrying, and clean cutting, clean threshing, clean sweeping, and clean removal of stalks.
    In order to harvest early rice and plant late rice quickly and well, all regions have highly concentrated labor, vigorously carried out tool reforms, and launched a high work efficiency campaign. Bobai, Cangwu, and other counties have mobilized troops and generals from all sides, made reasonable arrangements, strengthened the main attack front, and invested more than 80% of the total labor force in the "double抢 [qiang - rush]."
　　Fujian
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 17th: Early rice in Fujian is gradually ripening, and the aroma of grain fills the air for miles. The broad masses of commune members, together with cadres who have gone deep into the forefront of the summer harvest and people from all directions who have come to support the summer harvest, are enthusiastically carrying out the rush harvest. To date, more than half of the early rice in the province has been harvested, and the harvest progress is much faster than in the same period last year.
    Under the guidance of the policy of planting more and harvesting more and achieving high yields and harvesting more, the area under early rice cultivation in Fujian this year has expanded by about 30% compared with last year. The area of high-yield fields, experimental fields, and command fields in various regions generally accounts for 30% to 40% of the early rice area. Except for some areas in the south that suffered serious losses to some early rice due to typhoons, heavy rains, and flash floods, most areas in the north, the western mountainous areas, the lower reaches of the Minjiang River, and the coastal areas, although suffering varying degrees of disasters, still have good growth of most early rice and are expected to increase production. Continuous good news of bumper harvests has been received from some of the harvested early rice. The Shuinan Comprehensive Farm in Jiangle County, located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, has focused on transforming key measures such as mountain ridges and rotten mud fields since spring plowing. The actual yield of 500 mu of double-season early rice in the whole farm averaged 508 jin per mu, an increase of 7% over last year.
    In the rush harvest of early rice, all regions have mobilized all departments such as organs, factories, enterprises, and schools to do their best to transfer all available manpower and materials to support the rush harvest and rush planting. More than 8,000 cadres directly under the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have gone to the countryside to support the rush harvest and rush planting. All regions have also made and used various new types of harvesting tools on a large scale to speed up the progress of early rice harvesting. To date, more than 175,000 sets of various harvesters and threshers have been promoted throughout the province.
　　Hunan
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 17th: Early rice in Hunan Province has successively ripened. Some areas in the Chenzhou Special Zone, where the season is earlier, have started to harvest.
    In order to do a good job in rushing the harvest of early rice and rushing the planting of late rice, and to ensure a bumper harvest, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee instructed all regions to seize the time to make preparations for "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" as early as possible. All regions in the province have generally adopted the measures of concentrating leadership, cadres, and labor, strengthening the main agricultural front. Many people's communes in Changde, Chenxian, Xiangtan and other special zones have adopted various methods such as streamlining logistics, exchanging the weak for the strong, and utilizing idle labor to concentrate 70% to 80% of the labor force to prepare for "double 抢 [qiang - rush]". From the province, county, commune to the brigade, Party committees at all levels have established front-line headquarters (posts) at each level, and leading cadres have gone to the front line. All departments and industries have also made supporting "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" their primary task, and have drawn manpower and material resources to actively support it. At present, the province has repaired and manufactured more than 110,000 rice threshing machines, more than 520,000 rice harvesting devices, 600,000 rice transplanters, and rushed to repair more than 12.8 million small farm tools such as bamboo baskets, rice buckets, sickles, brooms, and carrying poles, basically meeting the needs of harvesting and planting.
    In addition, all regions have comprehensively and carefully arranged the lives of commune members during the "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" period to ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and rest well during the "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" period.
　　Jiangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 17th: Early rice in Jiangxi Province has successively ripened, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. The Gannan area, where the season is earlier, has started full harvesting, and the central area has also started harvesting successively.
    The area under early rice cultivation in Jiangxi Province this year has increased by more than 4 million mu compared with last year. Now, all regions are concentrating leadership, cadres, labor, and tools and actively participating in the rush harvest battle. A large number of cadres have gone deep into the front line, strengthening leadership, and fighting in the fields with commune members. The district, county, and commune-level Party secretaries of the Gannan Administrative Region are taking the lead, and have concentrated 100,000 cadres and 400,000 commune members to participate in the rush harvest. According to the seasonal differences between mountainous and plain areas, Gan County first organized more than 20,000 laborers in the whole area to strengthen the harvesting force in the plain areas, greatly speeding up the harvesting progress.
    In the rush harvest, all regions are promoting the "five-fixed" responsibility system of fixing areas, fixing labor, fixing time, fixing tasks, and fixing quality to ensure the quality of harvesting. Each commune in Huichang County implements the "five-fixed" system, and all the more than 22,000 mu of early rice that have been harvested have been cleaned, threshed, picked, and swept clean.
　　Zhejiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 17th: Zhejiang has begun to rush the harvest of early rice and rush the planting of late rice. The coastal plains of the Wenzhou Special Zone have generally entered the stage of vigorous harvesting and planting, and Jinan, Ningbo, and the Hangjiahu area have also begun to harvest and plant successively. As of the 13th, the province had harvested more than 400,700 mu of early rice and transplanted 90,000 mu of successive late rice.
    The area of early rice harvest and late rice transplanting in Zhejiang Province this year has been expanded compared with last year. In order to ensure a good fight in this battle, Party committees at all levels are vigorously grasping the three concentrations of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Through specific scheduling, more than 80% of the labor force has been concentrated on the main attack front. Urban residents, school teachers and students, local garrison officers and soldiers, and organ cadres have also actively organized support teams to participate in the rush harvest and rush planting. In Jiaxing Special Zone alone, there are 150,000 people in the labor force supporting the rush harvest and rush planting in cities and towns.
    In the summer harvest and summer planting, all regions have manufactured and promoted the use of new-style tools in large quantities. In Wenzhou Special Zone alone, more than 410,000 large sickles and more than 56,000 rice transplanters have been promoted and used. These new tools have exerted great power in the summer harvest and summer planting, greatly improving work efficiency and quality. In order to ensure the timely repair of various tools used for rush harvest and rush planting, all parts of the province have recently organized 150,000 industrial and handicraft workers to establish mobile repair teams to go deep into the fields to repair agricultural tools, which is deeply welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.
    In the rush harvest and rush planting, leaders at all levels went to the front line. In Wenzhou Special Zone, 19,000 prefectural and county Party committee secretaries, commune Party committee secretaries, and cadres at all levels went to production teams and squads to participate in production and lead production.
　　Anhui
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 17th: Early rice in Anhui Province has generally approached ripening, and the Jiangnan area, where the season is earlier, has begun to harvest. The intense work of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to plant double-season late rice is about to unfold throughout the province. The main feature of this year's "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" work in Anhui is that there are many farm tasks and large tasks. The area of early rice in the province this year has expanded by more than 37% compared with last year. In about half a month, on the one hand, the task of harvesting and threshing early rice must be completed, and on the other hand, double-season late rice must be planted in time. At the same time, late corn, late sweet potatoes and other late autumn crops must be rushed to plant. The two special zones of Wuhu and Anqing, which have the largest "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" tasks in the province, established professional teams for harvesting, threshing, transportation, plowing, and planting in units of production teams as early as the end of June, based on the needs of harvesting and planting. The links were tightly connected to ensure that one piece was yellowed, one piece was harvested, one piece was plowed, and one piece was planted. Wuhu Special Zone has established "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" command organizations at all levels from the county to the production brigade, and has grasped the preparations for "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" all the way to the production team. The agricultural tool repair and distribution departments in the whole area have rushed to manufacture and repair more than 300,000 various "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" tools.
    Many areas have also completed all the farm work that could be done in advance during the "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" preparation stage, so as to free up labor for "double 抢 [qiang - rush]" during the harvest. In Anqing Special Zone, more than 310,000 people were dispatched to the mountains and rivers to accumulate fertilizer for double-season late rice. All the wild green manure crops collected and harvested in the entire area have been transported to the fields for cellar composting.
    Local organs, factories, mines, enterprises, and towns are also drawing labor to the countryside to support the "double 抢 [qiang - rush]". In Anqing Special Zone, more than 82,000 people were transferred to various places on the 14th and 15th to help farmers rush to harvest and plant.
