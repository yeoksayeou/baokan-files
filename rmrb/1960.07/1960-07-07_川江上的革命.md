In My Position

    Revolution on the Sichuan River
    Xu Mingzhou, Captain of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau's Ship 2006
    I am a seaman who has lived on the water for over thirty years. In the old society, I never dreamed that I could become a captain.
    In August 1958, just as the Great Leap Forward was sweeping the Sichuan River, the Party Committee of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau, in order to connect sea and river transport, dispatched the large landing craft "People No. 9" to Sichuan to participate in the Sichuan River transport work. At that time, the organization decided that I would be the chief pilot of this ship. I was both happy and afraid when I accepted this task. I was happy because the Party trusted me; I was afraid because this large landing craft was large in size, deep in draft, small in horsepower, and had no main rudder on its single engine; the bow was high, making it difficult to see, and I couldn't see the water conditions during navigation. If an accident occurred, it would have a negative impact on the Party. At this time, the Party encouraged me to try boldly and to do it boldly. With the support and encouragement of the Party, my confidence grew. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the concerted efforts of all the crew members, after four days of hard work, we safely sailed the "People No. 9" to Chongqing; this success opened up a path for sea-river intermodal transport, connecting the treacherous Sichuan River with the vast ocean. From this fact, I realized that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party and follow the mass line, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome.
    Southwest China has a large amount of timber that needs to be transported out of Sichuan to support construction in various places. This glorious and arduous task fell on the shoulders of our transportation personnel. In the Sichuan River, using ships to tow timber rafts out of Sichuan had never been done before in history. There were many difficulties. A large timber raft of more than two thousand meters, hanging behind, was difficult to maneuver. Subject to the impact of the rapids, it rushed around, making it easy to have accidents. I was not afraid. I thought: What kind of Communist Party member would I be if I was afraid of difficulties!
    In order to successfully complete the task, we closely relied on the leadership of the Party and relied on the masses. After research, we adopted the method of "hanging high and taking low." After eight days of hard fighting, we finally towed a timber raft of more than two thousand meters from Chongqing to Yichang for the first time. Later, we often traveled back and forth between Chongqing and Yichang to tow timber rafts. In the process of towing timber rafts, things were not always smooth. Especially when passing through the dangerous Three Gorges, the dangerous shoals and turbulent waters often confronted us, breaking the steel cables used to tow the timber rafts. In this way, we not only had to spend a lot of time reconnecting the broken steel cables, which prolonged the voyage, but also, in this situation, it was easy to have major accidents. Because of this, I thought day and night about how to ensure that no accidents occurred. I consulted with the workers on the timber raft, I went to other captains to learn from their experience, and after returning, I discussed with the comrades on the ship. After researching some methods, we experimented and summarized experience during the voyage. After a period of time, we finally mastered the rules of towing timber rafts: place the timber raft on the flowing water, and the sailing vessel should avoid going into the western currents. After this, towing timber rafts became smoother, and the number of timber rafts towed increased from one to two, and we towed not only during the day but also at night. The voyage was shortened from eight days to four days, a whole half shorter.
    This year, the volume of transportation has greatly increased, but full nighttime navigation downstream on the Sichuan River has not yet been realized, which has resulted in a loss of transport capacity. In order to achieve a greater leap forward this year, the Party Committee decided to experiment with full nighttime navigation downstream. Originally, this experiment was a single ship going downstream, but after research, we believed that we could tow four barges. The Party Committee supported us. When I led the fleet downstream that day, I thought that we would definitely encounter many difficulties this time. I closely relied on the leadership of the Party, mobilized the masses, and the entire ship was of one heart and one mind, fighting with all our strength, overcoming all the dangerous shoals of the Sichuan River, and successfully completing the task. Those difficulties that I had originally estimated quietly disappeared. After the successful trial of full nighttime navigation downstream, many ships and boats were able to navigate fully at night downstream, and transportation on the Sichuan River was greatly accelerated.

    川江上的革命
    长江航运局2006轮船长　徐明周
    我是一个海员，在水上生活了三十多年。在旧社会，我连做梦也没想到过，我能当船长。
    1958年8月，正当大跃进的浪潮席卷川江的时候，长江航运局党委为了沟通海河运输，调派了大型登陆艇人民九号进川，参加川江运输工作。当时，组织上决定我去担任这条船的大引水工作。我接受这个任务后，心里又高兴又害怕。高兴的是党对我的信任；害怕的是这条大登陆艇，船型大，吃水深，马力小，单车没有主舵；船首高，不好了望，航行中看不到水势，万一出了事故，将给党造成不良的影响。在这时，党鼓励我大胆尝试，大胆去干。我得到党的支持与鼓励，信心大了。在党的正确领导和全体船员的一致努力下，经过四天的奋战，安全地将人民九号开到了重庆；这一成功，为海河联运开辟了道路。使天险川江与辽阔的海洋一脉相通。我从这一件事实中认识到：只要依靠党的领导，走群众路线，天大的困难也是可以克服的。
    西南有大批木材需要运出川去支援各地建设，这个光荣而艰巨的任务，落在我们运输人员的肩上。在川江，用轮船拖木排出川，这在历史上还未曾有过。困难是很多的，一块二千多米的大木排，吊在后面，很难操纵，受着激流的冲击，横冲直撞，很容易出事故。我没有害怕，我想：怕困难还算什么共产党员！
    为了能胜利完成任务，我们紧紧依靠党的领导，依靠群众。经过研究，采取了“挂高取矮”的走法，经过八天的艰苦战斗，终于第一次把一块二千多米的木排，从重庆拖到了宜昌。以后，我们就经常往返在重庆至宜昌之间拖运木排。在拖运木排中，不是每次都是很顺利的，特别是经过天险三峡时，险滩恶水，总时常与我们作对，把拖木排的铅丝冲断，这样，我们不仅要花许多时间把断了的铅丝接上，延长了航行时间，而且在这种情况下，很容易出大事故。为了这件事，我日夜思考，怎么才能做到一点事故也不出，我找木排上的工人研究，我到别的船长那儿去取经，回来后，又同船上的同志一起商量。研究出一些办法，我们就在航行中边试验边总结经验。经过一段时间后，我们终于掌握了拖木排的规律：木排放在流水上，行轮避免钻西流。这以后，拖木排就顺利了，拖木排的数量由一块增加到两块，不但白天拖，晚上也拖。航期由八天缩短为四天，整整缩短了一半。
    今年，运输量大大增加，但是，川江下水还没有全面夜航，这就使运力受到了损失。党委为了实现今年更大的跃进，决定试验下水全面夜航。本来，这次试验是单船下驶，但我们经过研究后，认为可以拖四个驳子。党委支持了我们。那天，我领着船队下驶的时候，曾想过，这次一定会遇到许多困难。我紧紧依靠党的领导，发动群众，全船一条心，一股劲，战胜了川江各个滩险，胜利完成了任务。原来我所估计的那些困难，都悄悄地溜走了。这次下水全面夜航试验成功后，许多轮艇都能下水全面夜航了，川江运输大大加快了。
