Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, Jakarta: News: Chinese Consul Mao Xinyu from the Consulate General in Jakarta and more than ten officers from the Indonesian Army conducted an on-site investigation in Tjimahi on the afternoon of July 5th regarding the bloody massacre of overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang. Doctors from both sides jointly examined the bodies of the deceased.

The Indonesian Army officers who went to the scene to investigate included Lieutenant Colonel Aris, representative of Brigadier General Kosasih, Commander of the West Java Military Region; Lieutenant Colonel Agusni, military doctor from the Army Hospital designated by Kosasih to be responsible for examining the bodies of the victims; Major Atan, representative of the West Java Military Police; Major Anwar, Commander of the Tjimahi Garrison; and Captain Hermawan, representative of the West Java Military Region Command.

Also present at the scene were Hong Zaide, Chairman of the Bandung Chinese General Association, and heads of overseas Chinese groups in Tjimahi, as well as Dr. Chen Zhaolie, a physician entrusted by the Chinese Consulate General and accompanying Consul Mao Xinyu to be responsible for the autopsy.

Five overseas Chinese, Lin Dunhong, Huang Ximei (female), Guo Jinren, Chen Yurong (female), and Chen Binghe, who witnessed the massacre at the time, testified at the scene.

During the investigation, the witnesses tearfully recounted the detailed process of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang being brutally shot and killed.

The witnesses said that on the morning of July 3rd, when dozens of Indonesian soldiers went to Tjimahi to forcibly relocate the overseas Chinese there, there were fewer than ten overseas Chinese present, including women and children, and they were unarmed. This testimony by the witnesses shattered the utter lie of the Indonesian Army authorities that sixty people had besieged the soldiers with wooden sticks, stones, bottles, etc.

The witnesses said that Yang Mumei was kicked to the ground by soldiers and then shot to death. Ye Jinniang was shot down when she tried to step forward to rescue Yang Mumei after the latter was brutally murdered. Witness Chen Binghe was closest to Yang Mumei at the time. He said that he witnessed a soldier shooting at Yang Mumei, and she died immediately about one meter away from him, and his body was stained with blood sprayed from Yang Mumei's head. He also personally saw Ye Jinniang fall to the ground near him after being shot.

These testimonies by the witnesses fully demonstrated the truth of the Indonesian powerful group instigating the soldiers in West Java to create this bloody massacre, and eloquently exposed the Indonesian Army authorities' shameless fabrication that the deceased were shot due to "accidental firing while seizing a gun."

Witness Chen Yurong, Ye Jinniang's younger sister-in-law, bitterly accused the soldiers of preventing them from rescuing the victims after the massacre. She said that after she saw her sister-in-law Ye Jinniang fall to the ground, she wanted to step forward to rescue her, but was stopped by the soldiers. She had to crawl from under the soldiers' feet to hug her sister-in-law. At this time, Ye Jinniang could not speak, and blood was gushing from her heart, but she pointed painfully to her chest. Chen Yurong said that she shouted, "Save her! Save her!" but the overseas Chinese nearby were all pointed at with guns by the soldiers and could not move an inch. Chen Yurong also said that she hugged her sister-in-law and cried for a long time before she was allowed to send her sister-in-law to the hospital.

Witness Chen Binghe also accused that when he saw Ye Jinniang struggling painfully after being shot, he wanted to step forward to rescue her, but the soldiers pointed guns at him and forbade him to move.

After each witness finished speaking, Consul Mao Xinyu asked Major Anwar, the commander of the Tjimahi Garrison, to ask questions, but he said he had no comments. After all the witnesses had testified, Consul Mao Xinyu asked Major Anwar to guarantee the safety of the testifying overseas Chinese, so that they would not be threatened or retaliated against, and Anwar agreed.

After the on-site investigation was completed, Consul Mao Xinyu, along with the aforementioned officers and doctors from both sides, went to the place where the bodies of the two deceased were kept for an autopsy.

Thousands of overseas Chinese gathered on the nearby road in front of the mourning hall to pay their respects. When Consul Mao Xinyu observed a moment of silence for the deceased, the dozen or so children and many women of the deceased cried loudly, and the overseas Chinese present were also in tears.

Under the supervision of Consul Mao Xinyu and Major Anwar and other Indonesian officers, doctors from both sides jointly examined the bodies of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang. When examining Ye Jinniang's body, it was seen that she had many bullet holes, with more than eight bullet holes in her heart, lungs, abdomen, and arms, including three large bullet holes, indicating that she had been shot with at least two different calibers of bullets. Seeing that such a kind mother was so brutally murdered, the doctors performing the autopsy also shook their heads and sighed.

When examining Yang Mumei's body, those present saw that her abdomen was bulging because she was four months pregnant. She was shot on the left side of the bridge of her nose, penetrating her chest, and her skull was broken. In addition, there were large scars on her knees, indicating that she had been brutally kicked before being shot. During the autopsy, Yang Mumei's eight children were all outside crying sadly for their mother.

After the autopsy was completed, the bodies were placed in coffins, and thousands of overseas Chinese stood solemnly to bid farewell to the deceased.

Finally, Consul Mao Xinyu visited the families of the victims and, on behalf of Ambassador Huang Zhen and the Embassy and Consulates, expressed his sincere condolences to the families of the victims.

According to the agreement of the West Java Army authorities and the agreement of the doctors of both sides, the doctors of both sides had jointly drafted the autopsy certificate on the evening of the 5th. However, under the direction of its superiors, the West Java Army authorities suddenly overturned the agreement on the 6th and refused to allow the doctor designated by the West Java military to sign the autopsy certificate. Even so, the testimony of witnesses who witnessed the massacre and the certificate jointly drafted by the doctors of both sides have made it impossible for the Indonesian Army authorities, under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, to deny the brutal crime of this massacre of overseas Chinese women that it planned.

    我驻雅加达领事和印度尼西亚军官联合进行现场调查
    芝马圩华侨妇女被害情况惨不忍闻
    印度尼西亚有势力集团策动陆军当局抵赖罪行的谎言彻底破产
    新华社9日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻雅加达总领事馆领事毛欣禹和印度尼西亚陆军方面十多名军官一起在7月5日下午到芝马圩对屠杀华侨妇女杨木妹和叶金娘的流血惨案进行了现场调查，并由双方医生共同对死者的尸体进行检验。
    到现场调查的印度尼西亚陆军军官有西爪哇军区司令柯沙西准将的代表阿里斯中校、柯沙西指定的负责检验受害者尸体的陆军医院军医阿古斯尼中校、西爪哇宪兵部代表阿坦少校、芝马圩警备司令安瓦尔少校和西爪哇军区司令部代表赫马万上尉等。
    同到现场的还有万隆中华总会主席洪载德和芝马圩华侨团体负责人以及随同毛欣禹领事前往的中国总领事馆委托负责验尸的医师陈照烈。
    到现场作证的有当时目睹惨案发生经过的华侨林敦红、黄细妹（女）、郭进仁、陈玉蓉（女）和陈炳和五人。
    在调查时，见证人伤心地哭诉了杨木妹和叶金娘被野蛮地枪杀的详细经过。
    见证人说，7月3日上午，当印度尼西亚数十名军人到芝马圩用武力强迫那里的华侨迁离时，在场的华侨包括妇女和儿童在内还不到十人，而且是赤手空拳的。见证人的这个证词拆穿了印度尼西亚陆军当局所谓当时有六十人用木棍、石头、瓶子等围攻军人的彻头彻尾的谎话。
    见证人说，杨木妹是被军人踢倒在地后又被开枪打死的。叶金娘是在杨木妹惨遭毒手后想走上前去救护杨木妹时被开枪击倒的。见证人陈炳和当时离杨木妹所在地点最近。他说，他目睹一名军人对准杨木妹开枪，她立即死在离他一米左右的地方，他身上还染有杨木妹头部喷出的血迹。他也亲眼看到叶金娘在他附近中弹倒地的。
    见证人的这些证词充分说明了印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军人制造这一流血惨案的真相，雄辩地揭穿了印度尼西亚陆军当局所谓死者是由于“夺枪走火”而被打死的说法是无耻捏造。
    证人陈玉蓉是叶金娘的小姑，她悲愤地控诉了在惨案发生后军人禁止她们去救护受难者的暴行。她说，她看到她的嫂子叶金娘倒在地上后，要走上前去救护她，却被军人阻止。她只得从军人脚下爬过去抱住嫂子。这时，叶金娘已不能讲话，心口直冒鲜血，只是痛苦地用手指着胸部。陈玉蓉说，她当时呼叫“救救她吧！救救她吧！”但是旁边的华侨都被军人用枪指住，寸步也不得移动。陈玉蓉又说，她抱住嫂子哭叫了很久，才被允许把她的嫂子送到医院去。
    见证人陈炳和也控诉说，当他看到叶金娘中弹倒地痛苦地挣扎时，他想走上前去救护，但是军人用枪指着他，不准他移动。
    在每个证人叙述完毕后，毛欣禹领事请芝马圩警备司令安瓦尔少校提出问题，但他都表示没有意见。在所有的证人作证完毕后，毛欣禹领事要求安瓦尔少校保证作证的华侨的安全，使他们不受到威胁和报复，安瓦尔表示同意。
    现场调查完毕以后，毛欣禹领事同上述军官以及双方的医生前往停放两位死者遗体的地方验尸。
    在灵堂前的附近路上聚集了数千名前往吊唁的华侨。毛欣禹领事向死难者默哀时，死难者的十几个孩子和许多妇女哭声震天，在场的华侨也都泪流满面。
    在毛欣禹领事和安瓦尔少校以及其他印度尼西亚军官的监督下，双方医生共同检验了杨木妹和叶金娘的遗体。在检验叶金娘的尸体时看到，她身上弹孔累累，心、肺、腹部和两臂有弹孔八个以上，其中有三个大弹孔，这说明她身上至少遭到两种不同口径的子弹射击。看到这样一个善良的母亲竟被这样残酷的屠杀，验尸的医生也摇头唏嘘。
    在检验杨木妹的尸体时，在场的人看到她由于已怀孕四个月而腹部隆起。她的鼻梁左测中弹，贯穿胸部，脑壳已经破裂。此外，在膝盖上还有大块伤痕，这说明她在被枪杀之前，曾经遭到残酷的踢打。在验尸时，杨木妹遗下的八个孩子都在外面悲哀地哭叫着妈妈。
    验尸完毕后，入殓盖棺，几千名华侨肃立向死者告别。
    最后，毛欣禹领事访问了死难者的家属，代表黄镇大使以及大使馆和领事馆向死难者的家属进行了亲切的慰问。
    根据西爪哇陆军当局的同意和双方医生的协议，双方医生在验尸之后，已在5日晚上共同拟就了验尸证明书。但是西爪哇陆军当局在其上级指使下忽然于6日推翻协议，不准西爪哇军方指派的医生在验尸证明书上签字，虽然如此，目睹惨案发生的证人的证词和双方医生共同拟就的证明书，已经使在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动下的印度尼西亚陆军当局无法抵赖它所策划的这次屠杀华侨妇女的残暴罪行。
