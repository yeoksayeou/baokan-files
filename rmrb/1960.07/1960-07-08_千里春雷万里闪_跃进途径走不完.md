    A Thousand Li of Spring Thunder, Ten Thousand Li of Lightning - The Leaping Progress Path Has No End
    Mao Zilian, Weaving Worker, Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill, Henan Province
    Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of our Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill have completed the state production plan for the first half of the year twenty days ahead of schedule. Due to vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, more than 1,100 workers in the factory have been liberated from heavy manual labor and have embarked on the steed of mechanization and semi-mechanization.
    I am a weaving worker. In the past six months, under the cultivation of the Party and with the help of my sisters, I have achieved some success, and have successfully innovated twenty new processes and operating methods, such as "high-altitude flower hanging" and "four-to-one" patrol route, which are suitable for high-speed expansion of the loom watching capacity. The loom watching capacity has increased from 36 looms in January to 96 looms. Production exceeded the plan by 13,000 meters, the first-class product rate (quality) increased from 91% to 96%, and the state production plan for the first half of the year was completed in a comprehensive and balanced manner. In the first half of the year, I set a plan to help 30 sisters catch up with the advanced level. Now, I have helped 40 sisters catch up with the advanced level.
    The first half of the year has passed. Looking back, we have taken a big step forward on the road of socialist construction; looking forward, there are even greater and more glorious tasks that need us to do. There were certain achievements in the first half of the year, and the second half of the year should be even redder, red to the end; the first half of the year made leaping progress, and the second half of the year should make even greater leaping progress, and sustained leaping progress. As people say: "A thousand li of spring thunder, ten thousand li of lightning, the leaping progress path has no end, tasks come one after another, leaping progress year after year." Our determination is: not to be complacent, not to relax, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and promote sustained leaping progress in production. My own plans are:
    1. Seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and finish reading Volumes I, II, and III of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and guide my work.
    2. Learn new technologies, master new technologies, and reform new technologies. In the second half of the year, create 20 new processes and new operating methods, and consolidate and improve the "Leaping Progress Work Method" to make advanced experience blossom and bear fruit in an all-round way.
    3. Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, ensure that the output in the second half of the year exceeds the plan by 30,000 meters, the quality reaches 98%, and strive for 100%, and continuously complete all indicators in a comprehensive and balanced manner.
    4. Promote the communist spirit of emphasizing the collective and helping others, and continue to help 50 weaving workers with lower technical levels in the entire workshop catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, and become the advanced.
    In short, in the second half of the year, I am determined to continue to exert full effort, show a spirit of perseverance, ride the wind and waves, and make sustained leaping progress, and strive to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule.

    千里春雷万里闪  跃进途径走不完
    河南郑州国棉三厂织布女工　毛子莲
    我们郑州国棉三厂职工，在党的领导下，已提前二十天完成了上半年国家生产计划。由于大搞技术革新和技术革命，全厂已有一千一百多名工人从笨重的手工操作中解放出来，跨上了机械化半机械化的骏马。
    我是一个织布女工。这半年来，在党的培养下，在姐妹们的帮助下，获得了一些成绩，革新成功了
  “高空挂花”、“四比一”巡回线路等二十项适应高速度扩大看台的新工艺和新操作法，使看台能力由1月份的三十六台扩大到九十六台，产量超产一万三千米，一等品率（质量）从91％提高到96％，全面均衡的完成了上半年国家生产计划。上半年，我订立了一个帮助三十个姐妹赶上先进水平的计划。现在，我已经帮助四十个姐妹赶上了先进的水平。
    上半年已经过去了。回头看，我们在社会主义建设的道路上跨进了一大步；往前看，还有更伟大更光荣的任务需要我们去做。上半年有一定成绩，下半年要更红，一红到底；上半年跃进，下半年要更大跃进，持续跃进。正如人们说的：“千里春雷万里闪，跃进途径走不完，任务一个接一个，跃进一年胜一年”。我们的决心是：不自满，不松劲，高举毛泽东思想红旗，推动生产持续跃进。我自己的打算是：
    一、认真学习毛主席著作，读完毛泽东选集一、二、三卷，以毛泽东思想武装自己，指导自己的工作。
    二、学习新技术，掌握新技术，改革新技术，下半年创造二十项新工艺、新操作方法，并巩固提高“跃进工作法”，使先进经验全面开花结果。
    三、学先进，赶先进，保证下半年产量超产三万米，质量达到98％，力争百分之百，持续全面均衡的完成各项指标。
    四、发扬以集体为重，以助人为乐的共产主义精神，继续帮助全车间五十名技术水平较低的挡车工赶上先进，超过先进，当先进。
    总之，下半年我决心继续鼓足干劲，拿出钻劲，乘风破浪，持续跃进，为提前完成全年计划而努力。
