"Three-way combination" is a treasure
Yang Jiajun, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Committee of Liuzhou Zinc Plant

　　"“Three-way combination” is a treasure; wherever the leadership goes, a leap forward follows; key problems are quickly resolved, and production surges higher and higher." The workers are absolutely right. Over the past two years, because we have grasped this treasure, production has been like a galloping horse. In 1959, our plant completed its production plan ninety-two days ahead of schedule; this year, by June 15th, we had already achieved the feat of comprehensively completing more than half of the annual production plan.

　　More than a year of facts has made me deeply realize that as a grassroots leader, only by constantly going deep into production, discussing and deciding with the workers in labor, can we discover and solve problems in a timely manner; at the same time, only by using the "three-way combination" method can problems be solved faster and better. Take the first half of this year as an example. Due to the continuous development of transportation and production, the high-quality coal that had been used for years could not be supplied, and the low-quality coal had insufficient heating power, which seriously affected production. At this time, the secretaries and directors immediately led the department cadres and technicians deep into the key workshops, worked alongside the workers, and sought advice and ideas from the workers. They quickly found a solution that not only saved the state a large amount of high-quality coal but also increased the furnace temperature compared to using high-quality coal. For example, in February and March, the production of lithopone always failed to leap forward. The secretaries and directors looked for the reasons at the workshop's "three-way combination" production meeting and, after repeated on-site experiments, quickly summarized a new set of operating methods that increased barium dissolution efficiency by one to two times, ensuring that lithopone production exceeded the monthly quota. In the plant's technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," the "three-way combination" is even more impressive. Every innovation is discussed and jointly created by leading cadres, technicians, and workers.

　　In the large-scale new technology campaign in May and June, leaders and technicians first studied the preliminary plan with workshop cadres, and then discussed it with the workers and worked together. As a result, it took only two days and ten hours to save 70% to 80% of large and small equipment, shorten three processes, eliminate one technological process, save 19% of the labor force, and increase production efficiency by 33% or even two times.

　　The "three-way combination" leadership method has brought about a great leap forward in the first half of the year. At the beginning of the third quarter, with the preparatory work already in place, we are determined to advance victoriously and let the treasure of "three-way combination" show even greater power in future production.

    “三结合”是个宝
    中共柳州锌品厂委员会副书记　杨家骏
      “三结合”是个宝，领导到哪哪里跃，关键问题解决快，生产热浪高又高。”职工们说得太对了，两年来，由于我们抓住了这个宝，生产如快马飞奔。1959年我厂提前九十二天完成了生产计划；今年到6月15日止，又取得了全面完成全年生产计划一半以上的战果。
    一年多的事实，使我深刻地体会到，作为一个基层领导干部，只有不断地深入到生产中去，在劳动中同工人群众同谋共断，才能及时发现问题，解决问题；同时，也只有用“三结合”的方法，才能使问题解决得更快更好。就拿今年上半年来说吧，由于运输和生产的不断发展，历年来一直应用的优质煤供应不上，低质煤火力不足，严重地影响了生产。这时候，书记、厂长们马上带领科室干部、技术人员深入重点车间，跟班劳动，向工人求谋问计，很快找到了方法，不但为国家节省下大批优质煤，而且炉温比用优质煤还提高了。又如2、3月里，立德粉产量总是跃不上去，书记、厂长们在车间“三结合”生产会上找原因，并经过反复现场试验，很快就总结出一套新的操作方法，使溶钡效率提高一至二倍，保证了立德粉月月超产。在全厂以
  “四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动中，“三结合”更是大显威风。每项革新都是领导干部、技术人员、工人一起讨论，共同制造的。
    在5、6月大搞新工艺中，领导、技术人员同车间干部，先研究出初步方案，然后与工人一起讨论，共同动手，结果，只用了两天零十小时，就使大小设备节约了70％到80％，缩短了三个工序，并取消了一个工艺过程，节省了19％劳动力，生产效率提高了33％甚至到两倍。
      “三结合”领导方法带来了上半年的大跃进，在准备工作早已就绪的三季度之始，我们决心乘胜前进，让“三结合”这个宝在今后生产中显示出更大的威力。
