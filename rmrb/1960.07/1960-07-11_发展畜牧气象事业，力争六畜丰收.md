　　Develop Animal Husbandry Meteorology, Strive for Livestock Prosperity
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
    Animal husbandry is affected by meteorological conditions. Good meteorological conditions can create a suitable environment with lush grass and warm weather, promoting the development of animal husbandry production. Poor meteorological conditions, especially in the event of disastrous weather, can lead to livestock deaths due to hunger, cold, and epidemics if prevention is not properly implemented. Therefore, mastering the relationship between meteorology and animal husbandry production, developing animal husbandry meteorological services, actively overcoming natural disasters, and fully utilizing suitable meteorological conditions can promote the high-speed development of animal husbandry production.

    In recent years, with the rapid development of animal husbandry production, China's animal husbandry meteorological work has also greatly developed. Animal husbandry meteorological service networks have been basically established in various regions; disaster weather forecasts have played a significant role in the fight against disaster prevention and livestock protection. Taking Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as an example, before liberation, livestock losses due to weather disasters were as high as about 11%. After liberation, this had dropped to 2%-4% by 1958. In the 1959 pastoral year, despite seven major snowstorms, preliminary statistics show that livestock losses due to weather disasters decreased by 55% compared to 1958. After carrying out animal husbandry meteorological services and strengthening various preventive measures, Shandong Province reduced the number of pig deaths last winter and this spring by 650,000 heads compared to the previous year. Guiyang County and other places in Hunan Province have basically achieved the goal of not freezing a single pig to death.

    Animal husbandry meteorological work serves as the eyes and ears of the Party committees at all levels and the animal husbandry production departments in leading and conducting animal husbandry production. The rapid development and good utilization of this work can not only protect livestock from weather disasters or minimize their impact, but also fully utilize meteorological conditions to fatten livestock in all seasons, making pigs fat and cattle strong, and ensuring the prosperity of all livestock. At present, the people of the whole country are responding to the Central Committee's call to "take pig raising as the center and comprehensively develop animal husbandry," and a vigorous upsurge in large-scale animal husbandry production has been launched, urgently requiring the further development of animal husbandry meteorological services and the vigorous strengthening of the fight against weather disasters. Meteorological departments at all levels should, on the basis of doing a good job in disaster weather warnings and alerts, further focus on the key aspects of grazing, epidemic prevention, and breeding, and universally carry out meteorological service work. Local animal husbandry meteorological service networks also need to be further consolidated and developed. Pastoral areas should rapidly improve the conditions for transmitting forecasts so that various weather forecasts can be promptly disseminated to pastures (teams). People's communes and production brigades should conduct supplementary weather and animal husbandry meteorological forecast services in their self-run meteorological service outposts, carry out necessary meteorological observations and simple experimental research, and specifically apply them in production.

    Developing animal husbandry meteorological services, like developing other undertakings, must fully mobilize and rely on the masses, adhere to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and strengthen leadership in a down-to-earth, in-depth, and meticulous manner. The masses have a wealth of animal husbandry meteorological experience. Dao Enrib, an advanced worker in animal husbandry production and a livestock meteorology pacesetter in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has many good experiences in using meteorology to fatten livestock in all seasons. The livestock he raises are strong and fat, with one sheep being worth four of others' in weight, and the lamb survival rate is also high. Therefore, leading cadres must go deep among the masses, adopt the method of combining herders, breeders, meteorologists, and livestock veterinarians to discover the masses' experience, compare it with existing meteorological observation data, identify animal husbandry meteorological indicators for grazing, epidemic prevention, and breeding in different seasons, and use them as a basis for carrying out animal husbandry meteorological services and improving service quality. For example, the Jiading County Meteorological Service Station in Shanghai Municipality went deep into various commune pig farms to investigate and study, understand the past situation of frozen pig deaths, and analyzed meteorological records to find out the meteorological indicators for cold protection and warmth preservation of pigs in winter, promptly preventing losses. This approach is worth popularizing in various places.

    We believe that as long as Party organizations in various places earnestly strengthen their leadership over animal husbandry meteorological work while vigorously developing animal husbandry production, they will certainly be able to promote the faster development of animal husbandry meteorological services, thereby more effectively overcoming natural disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest of livestock.

　　发展畜牧气象事业，力争六畜丰收
　　本报评论员
    畜牧业受着气象条件的影响。气象条件好，就能形成一个水草丰美、风和日暖的适宜环境，促进畜牧业生产发展；气象条件不好，特别是遇到灾害天气，如果不作好预防，牲畜往往会因饥寒和病疫流行而易于死亡。因此，掌握气象对畜牧业生产的关系，发展牧畜气象事业，积极战胜天灾，并充分利用适宜的气象条件，便能促进畜牧业生产的高速度发展。
    近几年来，随着畜牧业生产的迅速发展，我国畜牧气象工作也有了很大的发展。各地区畜牧气象服务网已基本建成；灾害性天气预报服务在防灾保畜斗争中发挥了显著的作用。仅就内蒙古自治区来说，解放前因天气灾害而损失的牲畜高达11％左右，解放以后到1958年已下降到2％—4％；而在1959年的牧业年度，虽有七次大风雪入侵，但据初步统计，因天气灾害损失的牲畜却比1958年又减少了55％。山东省在开展畜牧气象服务并且加强了各项预防工作以后，去冬今春生猪死亡的数字比上一年度减少了六十五万头。湖南省桂阳县等地还基本上做到了不冻死一头猪。
    畜牧气象工作是各级党委和畜牧生产部门领导和进行畜牧业生产的耳目。这项工作发展得快，运用得好，不仅可以使牲畜不受或少受天气灾害；还能充分利用气象条件，四季抓膘，使猪肥牛壮，六畜兴旺。当前，全国人民响应中央提出的“以养猪为中心，全面发展畜牧业”的号召，已掀起了一个轰轰烈烈大搞畜牧业生产的高潮，迫切需要进一步开展畜牧气象服务，大力加强预防天气灾害的斗争。各级气象部门应该在作好灾害性天气预报警报的基础上，进一步抓住牧养、疫病、繁殖等几个主要关键，普遍开展气象服务工作。各地的畜牧气象服务网，也需要进一步巩固和发展。牧区应迅速改善传递预报的条件，使各项气象预报能及时深入到放牧场（队）。人民公社和生产大队，应在自办的气象服务哨组中，进行天气和畜牧气象补充预报服务，开展必要的气象观测和简易的试验研究，并在生产中具体运用。
    发展畜牧气象事业，如同发展其它事业一样，必须充分发动群众和依靠群众，坚持土洋结合的方针，并且要踏踏实实深入细致的加强领导。群众中的畜牧气象经验是十分丰富的。内蒙古自治区畜牧业生产先进工作者、畜牧气象标兵道恩日布，就有许多利用气象四季抓膘的好经验，他饲养的牲畜膘壮肉肥，一只羊能抵得上别人四只的重量，羊羔成活率也高。因此，领导干部一定要深入到群众中去，采取牧民、饲养员、气象员、畜牧兽医人员互相结合的办法，把群众的经验发掘出来，对照已有的气象观测资料，分别季节，找出牧养、疫病、繁殖等的畜牧气象指标，作为开展畜牧气象服务和提高服务质量的依据。例如上海市嘉定县气象服务站，深入各公社养猪场调查研究，了解过去冻死猪只情况，对照气象记录分析，找出了冬天猪只防寒保暖的气象指标，及时预防，减少了损失。这种做法值得在各地推广。
    我们相信，只要各地党组织在大力发展畜牧业生产的同时，切实加强对畜牧气象工作的领导，就一定能促使畜牧气象事业更快的发展，从而更有效地战胜自然灾害，保证六畜丰收。
