Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: A group of inventors in the Soviet Belarusian Republic have developed a method to process various agricultural by-products into high-quality, highly nutritious feed that livestock love.

The raw materials they use are wheat straw, rice bran, coarse dry weeds, flax stalks, and even small branches and short fibers from peat. The nutritional value of the product processed from every thousand kilograms of by-products is equivalent to four hundred kilograms of wheat bran.

During processing, the raw materials are first crushed and placed in a hydrolysis tank with a 0.2% hydrochloric acid solution. High-temperature steam is then introduced, and the mixture is steamed for two to two and a half hours. As a result of hydrolysis, the processed raw materials accumulate a large amount of sugar, approximately 5% to 25% of the dry raw material. Afterwards, it is transferred to a fermentation tank for cooling. During the cooling process, air is constantly introduced to saturate it with oxygen and remove harmful substances (such as furfural). Then, some fermented feed or koji (Aspergillus oryzae) is added as yeast, along with a small amount of ammonium salt. The fermentation process lasts about 24 hours. During this period, due to the growth of yeast cells, the product becomes rich in protein.

After this treatment, the putrefactive bacteria and other harmful microorganisms in the raw materials are eliminated, and a good smell and slightly sour taste are produced, which livestock are very willing to eat.

　　苏联发明家集体创造的新方法
　　农业下脚料可制成优良饲料
　　这种饲料营养价值高牲畜很爱吃
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联白俄罗斯共和国的一群发明家研究出了一种方法，可以把各种农业下脚料加工成为牲畜爱吃的、具有高度营养价值的优良饲料。
    他们使用的原料是麦秸、谷糠、粗的干野草、亚麻秆以至小树枝和泥炭中的短纤维等。每一千公斤下脚料加工出来的产品的营养价值，可以相当于四百公斤麦麸。
    加工的时候，首先把原料磨碎，放到水解槽中加入0.2％的盐酸溶液，通入高温蒸气，蒸煮二小时到二小时半。水解结果，加工原料积出了大量的糖份，约为干原料的5％到25％。以后转到发酵槽里进行冷却。冷却过程中经常通入空气，使之饱含氧气并除去其中有害物质（糠醛等）。然后加入一些发过酵的饲料或麯子做酵母，加入少量铵盐。发酵过程持续约一昼夜。这期间，由于酵母细胞的生长，产品中就会饱含蛋白质了。
    经过这样处理后，原材料中的致腐细菌和其它有害的微生物都消灭了，产生了良好的气味，微酸的味道，牲畜很乐意吃。
