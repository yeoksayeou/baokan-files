Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 5th: According to a Middle East News Agency report from Khartoum on July 4th, Cairo newspapers published on the 4th that a U.S. U-2 aircraft was forced to land at Khartoum Airport in Sudan on the 2nd.

The newspapers did not publish any comments on this matter, but the Middle East News Agency report once again emphasized that this type of aircraft—one of which was shot down in the Sverdlovsk region of the Soviet Union—is specifically used by the United States for espionage flights over other countries.

The forced landing of the U.S. U-2 spy plane at Khartoum Airport once again demonstrates that these aircraft continue to fly in the Near East region.
