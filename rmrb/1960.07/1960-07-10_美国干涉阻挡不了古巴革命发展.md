Castro says U.S. imperialism is miscalculating and will move from failure to failure
Havana: Seven thousand demonstrate, chanting "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Cuba will win"
Cuban government sternly rejects unreasonable U.S. protests and denounces U.S. economic aggression
Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 8th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a television address tonight that the U.S. government is an enemy of the people of all countries on the road to progress. He said that whenever a country's people want to gain freedom and become masters of their own destiny, the U.S. government tries to destroy them. This is the history of U.S. policy toward Latin America and the world.

Speaking of the recent crimes of U.S. threats and interference against Cuba, Castro said that the U.S. government is trying to make Cuba a country without fuel. However, Cuba has not lost fuel, but the U.S. refineries have. Castro said that Cuba will also win the sugar battle. He emphasized that the law authorizing the nationalization of foreign enterprises by the revolutionary government was adopted to defend the interests and economy of the country and to fight against monopolies that make the people hungry. Castro emphasized that the greater the obstacles, the more the revolution will progress, because the revolutionary energy of the people is infinite.

Castro said that any aggression should be resolutely resisted without taking a single step back. He pointed out that if the United States, after economic aggression, even decides to carry out armed aggression against Cuba, they will also be defeated, because the cause of the Cuban people is just, and the characteristic of imperialist policy is error. Castro said that imperialism miscalculates and fails; miscalculates again and fails again; they move from failure to failure in this way. This is the situation in Cuba so far.

Castro emphasized that the support of the people of Latin America and the world for the Cuban revolution is growing, as demonstrated by President Dorticos' trip to Latin America. He also said that the Cuban people also maintain friendly relations with the American people, who are different from the American oligarchs, who are the culprits of aggression against Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 8th: About seven thousand workers, militiamen, and citizens of Havana held a demonstration this afternoon against U.S. imperialist aggression.

A delegation of demonstrators handed a joint statement from the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the University Students' Federation, the July 26th Movement, the People's Socialist Party, and the Revolutionary Guidance Committee to the Mexican ambassador, thanking the Standing Committees of both houses of the Mexican Congress for the statement of support for the Cuban revolutionary government sent on the 7th. The joint statement said that the Cuban people believe that Cuba's cause is just and will be supported by all brotherly people. The Cuban people are convinced that victory will ultimately belong to them.

The demonstrators held up signs reading "Cuba, yes, Yankees, no," "Cuba is a nation, not a colony," and "We are ready to make any sacrifice for the revolution," and enthusiastically chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism" and "We will win."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 8th: The Cuban government replied to the U.S. government on the evening of the 7th, sternly rejecting the "protest" raised by the U.S. government regarding the Cuban government's takeover of U.S.-owned oil refineries. The newspapers today published this note.

The note said that the Cuban revolutionary government firmly rejects the U.S. government's protests regarding the actions taken against U.S. enterprises in accordance with the law. The note pointed out that it is not the U.S. government that is responsible for interpreting Cuban law, but the Cuban courts. Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign country.

The note pointed out that the actions of Texaco and Esso Mobil in refusing to refine crude oil not only violated the Cuban law on flammable minerals, which has been in effect since 1938, but also constituted a crime of resisting the Cuban nation and people. The note pointed out that this action had a dual purpose: on the one hand, to seriously damage the country's economic activities, and on the other hand, to force the government to submit to the instructions of the oil monopoly, which tragically refuses to recognize that Cuba today is no longer a colonial commercial agency.

The note added that the actions of Texaco and Esso Mobil are a deliberately planned international provocation aimed at returning Cuba to a colonial state dependent on foreign political and economic interest groups. The privilege granted by the U.S. Congress to President Eisenhower to arbitrarily determine the quota of Cuban sugar imports sharply shows the origin and purpose of this provocation.

The note emphasized that the Cuban government strongly rejects the false and malicious accusations fabricated by the United States. The note pointed out that world public opinion has just cause to express indignation and mobilize against this shameless economic aggression planned, organized, and carried out by the U.S. government.

The Cuban government also responded to the British government's note regarding the Cuban government's takeover of Shell Oil. The reply condemned that "Shell Oil in Cuba has pursued a policy that runs counter to the national interests of Cuba."

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, Washington: The U.S. President and senior officials of the State Department are holding frequent talks, plotting further interference and aggression against Cuba. U.S. Secretary of State Herter abruptly interrupted his vacation in Massachusetts on the 8th and flew back to Washington. White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced in Newport, Rhode Island, that Herter would travel to Newport on the 10th or 11th to "discuss the Cuban situation" with U.S. President Eisenhower, who is currently there. Brigadier General Goodpaster, the White House liaison officer with the U.S. State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency, will also attend the meeting. Before leaving Washington for Rhode Island, Eisenhower had just convened a meeting of the U.S. National Security Council on the 7th to discuss further intervention in Cuba. After returning to Washington on the 8th, Herter immediately held talks with Acting Secretary of State Dillon.

    美国干涉阻挡不了古巴革命发展
    卡斯特罗说美帝国主义打错算盘必将从失败走向失败
    哈瓦那七千人示威激昂高呼“打倒美帝国主义”“古巴必胜”
    古巴政府严正拒绝美国无理抗议并痛斥美国经济侵略
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天晚间在电视讲话中严厉谴责美国政府是各国人民前进道路上的敌人。他说，每当一国人民想获得自由和成为自己命运的主人的时候，美国政府就企图摧残他们。这就是美国对拉丁美洲和全世界执行的政策的历史。
    卡斯特罗谈到最近美国对古巴进行的威胁和干涉的罪行时说，美国政府企图使古巴成为没有燃料的国家。但是，古巴并没有失去燃料，而美国的炼油厂却没有了。卡斯特罗说，古巴也将赢得食糖战役。他强调指出，革命政府授权把外国企图收归国有的法律是为保卫国家的利益和经济，为反对使人民忍饥挨饿的垄断集团而采取的。卡斯特罗强调指出，障碍越大，革命就越发向前进展，因为人民的革命精力是无穷无尽的。
    卡斯特罗说，任何侵略都应该遭到坚决的反抗，一步也不后退。他指出，如果美国继经济侵略之后竟然决定对古巴进行武装侵略，他们也将被击败，因为古巴人民的事业是正义的，而帝国主义政策的特征就是错误。卡斯特罗说，帝国主义错打算盘和遭到失败；再错打算盘，再遭到失败；他们就这样从失败走向失败。直到目前为止，他们在古巴的情况就是这样。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，拉丁美洲和世界各国人民对古巴革命的支援正日益增长，这一点在多尔蒂科斯总统的拉丁美洲之行中得到了证明。他还说，古巴人民也同美国人民保持着友好，美国人民不同于美国的寡头，寡头才是对古巴进行侵略的祸首。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　哈瓦那的大约七千名工人、民兵和市民今天下午举行了反对美帝国主义侵略的示威。
    示威群众的一个代表团把古巴工人联合会、大学生联合会、7月26日运动、人民社会党和革命指导委员会的一项联合声明交给了墨西哥大使，感谢墨西哥国会两院的常务委员会在7日发来的支持古巴革命政府的声明。联合声明说，古巴人民相信古巴的事业是正义的，是会得到所有兄弟人民的支援的。古巴人民确信，胜利终将属于他们。
    示威群众高举写有“要古巴，不要美国佬”、“古巴是国家，而不是殖民地”和“我们准备为革命做出任何牺牲”字样的标语牌，并且情绪激昂地高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“我们必胜”的口号。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴政府7日晚复照美国政府，严正拒绝美国政府对古巴政府接管美资炼油厂一事所提出的“抗议”。今天各报刊载了这个照会。
    照会说，古巴革命政府坚决拒绝美国政府关于对美国企业依法采取的行动所提出的抗议。照会指出，负责解释古巴法律的不是美国政府，而是古巴法庭。古巴是自由、独立和主权的国家。
    照会指出，德士古石油公司和埃索美孚油公司拒绝提炼原油的行动实际上不仅违反了古巴从1938年起就实行的可燃性矿物法，而且同时构成了抵制古巴国家和人民的罪行。照会指出，这一行动具有双重目的：一方面严重破坏国家的经济活动，另一方面迫使政府屈从石油垄断集团的指令，这个石油垄断集团可悲地拒绝承认今天的古巴已经不是殖民地商业代办处了。
    照会又说，德士古石油公司和埃索美孚油公司的行动是一个处心积虑的国际挑衅的步骤，其目的是要使古巴重新回到依附于外国政治经济利益集团的殖民地状况。美国国会授与艾森豪威尔总统任意决定进口古巴糖定额的特权尖锐地表明了这一挑衅的根源和目的。
    照会强调指出，古巴政府强烈拒绝美国所捏造的虚假的和心怀叵测的指控。照会指出，世界舆论有正当理由表示愤慨，并动员起来反对这种由美国政府谋划、组织和进行的无耻的经济侵略。
    古巴政府也回答了英国政府就古巴政府接管壳牌石油公司一事所提出的照会。复照谴责“在古巴的壳牌石油公司奉行了违背古巴国家利益的政策”。
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统和国务院高级官员正在进行频繁的会谈，策划进一步干涉和侵略古巴。美国国务卿赫脱8日突然中断了他在马萨诸塞州的休假，乘飞机赶回华盛顿。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂当天在罗得岛新港宣布，赫脱将在10日或11日前往新港，同目前在那里的美国总统艾森豪威尔“讨论古巴局势”。白宫同美国国务院、国防部和中央情报局的联络员古德帕斯特准将也将参加这次会谈。艾森豪威尔在离开华盛顿前往罗得岛以前，刚刚在7日召开美国国家安全委员会的会议，讨论了进一步干涉古巴的问题。赫脱在8日回到华盛顿以后，立即同代理国务卿狄龙举行了会谈。
