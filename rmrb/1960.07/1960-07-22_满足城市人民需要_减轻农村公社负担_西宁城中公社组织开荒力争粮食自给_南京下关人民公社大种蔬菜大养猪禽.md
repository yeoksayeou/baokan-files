Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 21st: While doing a good job in running commune-operated industries, the Chengzhong People's Commune in the Chengdong District of Xining City has launched a mass movement of reclaiming wasteland and actively supporting agriculture.

The People's Commune has rationally arranged the labor force of the entire commune and adopted a method of combining long-term agricultural teams and temporary shock brigades to ensure agricultural production. Since last winter and this spring, the commune has successively dispatched more than 400 members to Guinan County and Xining suburban Xishan and Beishan farms to reclaim wasteland, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. Wheat, highland barley, potatoes and other crops have been planted on more than 1,500 mu of newly reclaimed land. Now the wheat and highland barley are flowering and are in the process of grain filling, and will soon be harvested. The commune has dispatched a group of members to form an agricultural professional team, camping and settling down in the newly reclaimed land, and carrying out field management work such as weeding, topdressing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests.

While vigorously developing agriculture, the commune is carrying out extensive cooperation between industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas within and outside the commune, and vigorously supporting agriculture. Since this spring, they have organized more than 25,400 laborers to the agricultural production teams of Zhongzhuang, Dongguan, Shenjiazhai and other people's communes, helping the communes reclaim and weed more than 2,500 mu according to the principle of equivalent exchange; in mid-July, more than 250 commune members were organized to help with field management work. This group of agricultural production support teams includes workers from commune-run factories such as hardware repair, woodworking, bedding, shoe making, brick and tile, and comprehensive processing factories, as well as service personnel from the commune service station and cadres and family members of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and Qinghai Provincial Reclamation Department’s organs branch. At the same time, commune-run industries actively manufacture various agricultural tools to support agricultural production. The hardware repair factory has successfully trial-produced a seven-inch walking plow, and the woodworking factory is trial-producing wooden threshing machines and other machines.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 21st: The Xiaguan People's Commune in Nanjing City, while organizing collective units to actively develop non-staple food production with pig raising as the main focus, makes full use of existing conditions to run vegetable farms, pig farms, poultry farms, fish farms and other non-staple food production bases, continuously increasing the commercial volume of non-staple foods to meet the growing needs of urban people, and striving to achieve basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods such as vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish.

From January to June, the commune's pig raising increased more than nine times compared with the same period last year; the vegetable planting area expanded from 2,500 mu to 3,450 mu, with an average daily market supply of 74,000 jin; more than 66,000 poultry were raised; and more than 400,000 fish were raised. However, they are not satisfied with this, and have now established many large-scale vegetable farms, pig farms, poultry farms and fish farms. Each branch commune has also established "four farms". At the same time, more than 70% of the canteens in the entire commune raise pigs and grow vegetables, and many residents raise chickens and ducks.

The primary link in launching a mass movement to vigorously develop non-staple food production is to strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership. In the beginning, some people believed that the city should mainly focus on industry, while pig raising and vegetable growing were the responsibility of the countryside, emphasizing that production was busy, there were few people, and there were no conditions. Some people also had feelings of dependence and fear of difficulty. In light of this ideological situation, the Party committee repeatedly conducted education, analyzed the favorable conditions for developing non-staple food production in the Xiaguan area, such as barren mountains, wasteland, and ponds, so that everyone understood that vigorously developing non-staple food production was both necessary and possible, clarified the direction, and established confidence.

In terms of organizational leadership, the Party committee has one secretary and one standing committee member mainly responsible for this work, led by the director of the Commercial Sub-bureau, and stronger cadres were transferred to enrich the non-staple food production office. Each branch commune, factory, enterprise, organ, and school has a leading cadre in charge of this work, establishing and improving specialized institutions and professional teams to help each unit and production base continuously improve production management. In vigorously developing non-staple food production, the Party committee also educated the masses to solve problems independently with the spirit of "poor sticks," so that many difficulties were readily solved.

The result of the commune vigorously running "four farms" to develop non-staple food production is that commercial production has increased. In June, these bases supplied 1.84 million jin of vegetables to the market, sold 72 fat pigs to the state, and supplied more than 2,300 jin of fish, more than 200 geese, and more than 200 rabbits to the market. The commune also supported collective units and canteens with a batch of breeding pigs, seedlings, and fish fry, and helped various units train more than 200 epidemic prevention personnel.

    满足城市人民需要　减轻农村公社负担
    西宁城中公社组织开荒力争粮食自给
    南京下关人民公社大种蔬菜大养猪禽
    据新华社西宁21日电　西宁市城东区城中人民公社在搞好社办工业的同时，掀起了一个垦荒和积极支援农业的群众运动。
    这个人民公社把全社的劳动力进行了合理安排，采取了组织长期的农业队和临时突击队相结合的办法，保证农业上马。去冬今春以来，公社连续抽调了四百多名社员分赴贵南县和西宁郊区西山、北山农场开荒，力争粮食达到自给。这些农场在新开垦的一千五百多亩土地上播种小麦、青稞、洋芋等农作物，现在小麦、青稞已正在扬花、灌浆，不久就可收割。公社已抽调一批社员成立了农业专业队，在新垦地里安营扎寨，开展除草、追肥、防治病虫害等田间管理工作。
    公社在大力发展农业的同时，在公社内部和外部之间广泛进行工业和农业、城市和乡村之间的大协作，大力支援农业。从今年春天以来，他们根据等价交换的原则前后共组织了两万五千四百多个劳动力，到中庄、东关、沈家寨等人民公社的农业生产队，帮助公社开荒、除草两千五百多亩；7月中旬，又组织了二百五十多个社员去帮助进行田间管理工作。在这批支援农业生产的队伍中，包括五金修配、木工、被服、制鞋、砖瓦、综合加工厂等社办工厂的工人，还有公社服务站的服务人员以及中共青海省委、青海省农垦厅机关分社的干部和家属。和这同时，社办工业积极制造各种农具支援农业生产。五金修配厂已试制成功七寸步犁，木工厂正在试制木制脱粒机等机具。
    据新华社南京21日电　南京市下关人民公社在组织集体单位积极发展以养猪为主的副食品生产的同时，充分利用现有条件大办种菜场、养猪场、养禽场、养鱼场等各种副食品生产基地，不断提高副食品的商品量，以满足城市人民日益增长的需要，并力争实现菜、肉、禽、鱼等副食品基本自给。
    这个公社1至6月份，养猪较去年同期增长九倍多；蔬菜种植面积由二千五百亩扩大到三千四百五十亩，日上市量平均七万四千斤；饲养家禽六万六千多只；养鱼四十多万尾。但是，他们并不以此为满足，目前又建立了不少大型的种菜场、猪场、养禽场和养鱼场。各分社也建立了“四场”。同时，全公社70％以上的食堂都养了猪，种了菜，不少居民都养了鸡鸭。
    发动群众大搞副食品生产运动，首要一环是加强思想领导和组织领导。一开始，有些人认为：城市主要搞工业，养猪、种菜是农村的事，强调生产忙，人手少，没有条件，还有些人存在依赖、畏难情绪。党委根据这种思想状况反复进行了教育，并分析了下关地区有荒山、荒地及水塘等发展副食品生产的有利条件，使大家了解到大搞副食品生产，既有必要又有可能，明确了方向，树立了信心。
    在组织领导方面，党委有一个书记和一个常委主要负责这方面的工作，由商业分局局长具体领导，并抽调较强的干部充实副业生产办公室。各分社、工厂、企业、机关、学校都有一个正职或副职领导干部专管这项工作，建立和健全了专线专管机构和专业队伍，帮助各单位和生产基地不断地改进生产管理工作。在大搞副食品生产中，党委还教育群众以“穷棒子”精神，自力更生解决问题，使许多困难迎刃而解。
    这个公社大办“四场”发展副食品生产的结果，使商品性生产增加了。6月份，这些基地供应了市场蔬菜一百八十四万斤，卖给国家肥猪七十二头，供应市场二千三百多斤鱼、二百多只鹅、二百多只兔。公社还支援各集体单位和食堂一批种猪、苗禽、鱼秧，并帮助各单位训练了防疫人员二百余人。
