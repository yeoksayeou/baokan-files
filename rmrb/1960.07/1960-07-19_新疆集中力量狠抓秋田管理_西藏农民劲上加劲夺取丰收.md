Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 18th - The Party committees at all levels in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are concentrating leadership and labor to strengthen autumn field management, striving for increased production and a bumper harvest of autumn crops, which account for more than 60% of the annual total grain output. After thinning, autumn fields throughout the region have generally undergone one or two rounds of plowing and weeding. Over 30% of the autumn fields have been watered and fertilized once. Corn and cotton affected by pests and diseases have also been sprayed with pesticides, generally showing strong stalks and lush leaves, growing well.
    The autumn field area in the Autonomous Region this year has expanded by 37% compared to last year. From the end of sowing to the busy summer harvest, there is only about a month. Therefore, the characteristics of field management during this period are large tasks, concentrated farm work, and tight schedules. To this end, the Autonomous Region Party Committee issued an emergency instruction on June 17, requiring all localities to seize the short time before the summer harvest, immediately concentrate superior forces, and launch a concentrated field management campaign. According to the growth and management of various crops, they should organize one battle after another with different priorities and urgencies, using manpower and materials in the most important and needed areas. According to the instructions of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, fully mobilized the masses through vigorous publicity of the idea of ​​agriculture as the foundation and the great significance of managing autumn fields well; on the other hand, they conducted thorough investigations of farm work, labor, and crop conditions, and allocated and organized labor according to priorities and urgencies. Six special zones and autonomous prefectures in southern Tianshan, such as Kashgar and Aksu, started a "strike week" or "strike ten days" respectively, racing against time to thin and set seedlings for corn and cotton and prevent and control pests and diseases. The labor force put into field management in these areas accounted for about 65% of the total agricultural labor force.
    In the concentrated field management, all localities have taken measures suited to local conditions to tackle weak links and key points for increasing production. According to the characteristics of many weeds in the autumn fields, the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture concentrated more than 60% of its labor force to carry out a summer weeding campaign from June 20. By July 5, the autumn fields in the prefecture had basically completed the first weeding. Han Qingyu, the Party Committee Secretary of the Township Commune in Jimusaer County of this autonomous prefecture, carried his luggage to the fields and worked with the members of the Sixth Team of the Guangming Brigade, summarizing the six experiences of this team in creating high efficiency in weeding and promoting them in a timely manner, so that the daily weeding progress of the entire commune increased from 450 mu to 1,179 mu; In early July, this commune had weeded its 11,000 mu of autumn fields twice. The counties in Hami Prefecture, which are short of water and suffering from drought, regard water as the key to increasing agricultural production and organized more than 10,000 people to go to the Tianshan Mountains to melt snow and ice and dig wells to increase the amount of water to irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land. This prefecture also launched a campaign to cherish, protect, and save water, so that the irrigation efficiency increased from about 600 mu of land per flow per day and night in the past to more than 1,200 mu. Various crops in the entire prefecture have been generally irrigated one to two times, and the severely drought-stricken seedlings have been watered four times, basically relieving the drought.
    Now, the first and second battles centered on seedling stage management in the southern Xinjiang region have ended, and a certain proportion of the labor force continues to specialize in the management of autumn fields in combination with the summer harvest. The northern Xinjiang region, which is about to start the summer harvest, is seizing the current favorable opportunity to fully concentrate on summer weeding, irrigation, and elimination of pests and diseases.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 18th - The main crops of highland barley and wheat on the Tibetan plateau are generally flowering and filling, and rapeseed has also begun to pod. Cadres in various places are vigorously leading farmers to carry out late-stage field management work centered on weeding and preventing lodging, to seize a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    This year, the crops in Tibet have grown much better than in previous years. During the field management period, mutual aid groups in various places, under the leadership of county and district party committees, raised the issue of preventing lodging early on, and established thousands to tens of thousands of local fertilizer plants throughout the region, producing hundreds of millions of catties of bone meal, plant ash, and five-in-one fertilizer to strengthen stalks and prevent lodging. The more than 600 local fertilizer plants established in Longzi and Gongga counties in the Shannan Special Zone produced more than 30 million catties of local fertilizer. Many places' mutual aid groups also inserted wooden sticks in the fields and pulled ropes to prevent crops from lodging. This year's crops in Duilongdeqing County are growing unprecedentedly luxuriantly. Although the farmers in some mutual aid groups are very happy in their hearts, they are worried about lodging. The mutual aid groups led the farmers to discuss and solve the problem of rational irrigation and rational fertilization, and formulated many methods to prevent lodging. The farmers said with full confidence: In the past, when we worked for the manorial lords, whether the crops grew well or badly, whether they lodged or not, it was the same for us. Now the Communist Party leads us to divide the land and apply enough fertilizer. The crops grow extraordinarily well. As long as we take measures, we will definitely be able to prevent lodging.
    Now, mutual aid groups in various places have put forward the slogan of "sweating again, making another effort, finally removing all weeds in the fields," to ensure that the crops have large ears and full grains. Cadres and the masses in various places have gone to the fields to pull weeds. Zhang Pingfan, Secretary of the Linzhi Sub-Work Committee of the CPC, went to Linzhi, Xueba, Gongbujiangda and other counties to inspect the late-stage field management work with cadres and the masses, and launched a concentrated weeding campaign in several counties, combining weeding with storing winter feed, and combining weeding with composting green manure. Many villages and mutual aid groups appeared with no weeds in the fields.
    At present, the rainy season has arrived on the Tibetan plateau, and farmers in various places are stepping up drainage and flood prevention work to prevent crops from lodging and being flooded. Farmers in Mozhugongka, Dazi, Qushui and other counties along the Lhasa River have built hundreds of flood prevention dams, flood prevention ponds and drainage channels. (Attached picture)

　　新疆集中力量狠抓秋田管理  西藏农民劲上加劲夺取丰收
    新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各级党委集中领导力量和劳动力狠抓秋田管理，力争占全年粮食总产量六成以上的秋季作物增产丰收。全自治区秋田在间苗完毕后，已普遍中耕除草一两次，30％以上的秋田已浇过一次水，追过一次肥；发生病虫害的玉米、棉花也已经过打药，普遍株壮叶茂，生长良好。
    自治区今年秋田面积比去年扩大37％。从播种结束到夏收大忙只有一个月左右，因此这段时间的田间管理的特点是任务大、农活集中、时间紧。为此，自治区党委在6月17日发出紧急指示，要求各地抓紧夏收前短暂时刻，立即集中优势兵力，开展田间管理突击运动，根据各种作物生长情况和管理情况，分别轻重缓急组织一个战役又一个战役，把人力物力用于最当紧最需要的地方。各级党委根据自治区党委的指示，一方面通过大力宣传以农业为基础的思想和管好秋田的重大意义，把广大群众充分发动起来；一方面对农活、劳力、作物情况摸底排队，按轻重缓急调配和组织劳力。天山南部喀什、阿克苏等六个专区和自治州分别开始了突击周或突击旬，抢时间为玉米、棉花间苗定苗和防治病虫害。这些地区投入田间管理的劳力均占农业劳力总数的65％左右。
    在突击田间管理中，各地都因地制宜猛攻薄弱环节和增产关键。昌吉回族自治州根据秋田草多的特点，从6月20日开始集中60％以上的劳力突击夏锄，全州秋田到7月5日即基本锄完头遍草。这个自治州的吉木萨尔县城镇公社党委书记韩庆鱼背上行李到田间，和光明大队六小队社员一起劳动，总结出这个小队创造锄草高工效的六条经验，及时推广，使全公社锄草日进度由四百五十亩提高到一千一百七十九亩；7月初这个公社一万一千亩秋田就锄完了两遍草。缺水受旱的哈密专区各县，把水当作农业增产的关键，组织一万多人赴天山融雪化冰，掏泉打井，增加的水量灌地五万多亩。这个专区还开展了爱水保水省水运动，使浇水效率由过去一个流量一昼夜浇地六百亩左右提高到一千二百亩以上。全专区各种作物已普遍灌溉一到二次，受旱严重的禾苗浇水四次，基本解除了旱象。
    现在，南疆地区以苗期管理为中心的第一、二次战役已经结束，结合夏收仍有一定比例的劳力继续专管秋田。即将开始夏收的北疆地区，正抓紧当前有利时机，全力突击夏锄、灌水和消灭病虫害。
    新华社拉萨18日电　西藏高原上的主要农作物青稞、小麦普遍扬花灌浆，油菜也已开始结荚，各地干部正大力领导农民开展以拔草和防止倒伏为中心的后期田间管理工作，夺取今年农业丰收。
      今年西藏各地的庄稼长得比
  往年好得多，在田间管理期间，各地互助组在县、区党委领导下，就及早提出了防止倒伏的问题，在全区建立起了数千个到上万个土化肥厂，制造了上亿斤骨粉、草木灰、五合肥等壮秆防倒伏的土化肥。山南专区隆子、贡噶两县建立的六百多个土化肥厂，制造土化肥三千多万斤。许多地方的互助组还在田间插上木棍，拉上绳子，防止庄稼倒伏。堆龙德庆县今年的庄稼长得空前茂盛，有些互助组的农民虽然心中十分高兴，但又担心倒伏。互助组就领导农民们讨论解决合理浇水与合理施肥的问题，制订了许多防止倒伏的办法。农民们满怀信心地说：过去给农奴主种地，庄稼长得好与坏，倒伏不倒伏，对我们来说都是一样，现在共产党领导我们分了地，上足了肥料，庄稼长得格外好，只要采取措施，就一定能防止庄稼倒伏。
    现在，各地互助组又提出了再流一把汗、再加一把劲、最后除尽田间杂草，确保庄稼穗大粒饱的口号。各地干部和群众都纷纷下田拔草。中共林芝分工委书记张平凡到林芝、雪巴、工布江达等县，与干部、群众一起检查后期田间管理工作，在几个县内掀起了一个突击除草运动，作到拔草与储备冬饲料相结合，拔草与沤制绿肥相结合，出现了许多地无杂草的乡和互助组。
    目前，西藏高原上雨季已经来临，各地农民正加紧进行排水防涝工作，防止庄稼倒伏和被水淹坏。沿拉萨河的墨竹工卡、达孜、曲水等县农民，已修筑了上百个防洪堰、防洪池和排洪渠。（附图片）
