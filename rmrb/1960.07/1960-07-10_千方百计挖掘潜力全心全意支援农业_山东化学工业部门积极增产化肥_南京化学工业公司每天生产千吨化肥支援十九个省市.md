Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th. Shandong's chemical industry departments conscientiously implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation," actively increasing fertilizer production to provide efficient fertilizers for the current rural summer planting and autumn crops such as cotton.

According to statistics, in the first half of this year, the province's chemical industry departments have produced 161,317 tons of various fertilizers for rural areas, an increase of more than four times compared with the same period last year. Among them, the increase in potash fertilizer is the largest, increasing more than 40 times. The quality of various fertilizers has also improved significantly. For example, the effective phosphorus content of phosphate fertilizer has increased from 14% to 18%, with the highest reaching 20%.

In order to ensure the mass production of chemical fertilizers, Shandong has launched a mass movement to vigorously develop small-scale, indigenous chemical industries in accordance with the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." In the past year, more than 400 various fertilizer production furnaces have been built in the province, with an annual production capacity of more than 200,000 tons. Counties and most people's communes now have their own fertilizer plants. In the first half of this year, the fertilizer produced by small indigenous groups accounted for more than two-thirds of the province's total fertilizer output.

In order to increase fertilizer production, the staff and workers of the chemical departments in various places have extensively carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to solve key problems, thereby greatly increasing production. The calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer originally produced by the Tancheng Chemical Plant was difficult to crush because of its hard particle size after being discharged from the furnace. More than 40 of the plant's 70 employees were engaged in crushing. Now, due to the creation of a new treatment method, the crushing process has been eliminated, which not only saves manpower, but also changes the fertilizer from the original black carbonaceous granular shape to a white fibrous shape. The Wendeng Fertilizer Plant carried out comprehensive utilization in the production process, reducing the cost of each ton of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer by 50%, increasing the average daily output by about 30%, and increasing the effective phosphorus content from 10% to more than 15%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. The staff and workers of the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company are doing everything possible to increase fertilizer production. In the first half of the year, the total output of four types of fertilizers produced by the company—superphosphate, ammonium sulfate, ammonia water, and ammonium bicarbonate—has completed 60% of the annual plan, and 100,000 tons more fertilizer has been produced compared with the same period last year. At present, an average of more than 1,000 tons of fertilizer are being transported to 19 provinces and cities across the country by ships and trains.

The company's staff and workers have always regarded supporting agricultural technical transformation as their glorious duty. In order to produce more fertilizer to promote agricultural production, they have extensively carried out an increase production and conserve practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. In the raw material crushing and finished product loading and unloading sections of the ordinary calcium workshop of the Mineral Fertilizer Plant, most of the operations were originally manual. After technical reforms and the addition of mechanical equipment, the output of superphosphate in the first half of this year has increased by more than double compared with the same period last year, and the production cost per ton of superphosphate has been reduced by 17% compared with last year. The staff and workers of the ammonium bicarbonate plant have grasped the three key aspects of ammonia production, carbonization, and separation, and have continuously innovated operations, making the daily production level four and a half times higher than at the end of last year, and completing the entire year's production plan in four months.

In order to speed up the transportation of the produced fertilizer to various places to meet the needs of the agricultural season, the staff and workers have established a mechanized assembly line from the workshop to the train, increasing the loading capacity from 15 train cars per day to 40 train cars.

### 千方百计挖掘潜力全心全意支援农业  山东化学工业部门积极增产化肥  南京化学工业公司每天生产千吨化肥支援十九个省市

    千方百计挖掘潜力全心全意支援农业
    山东化学工业部门积极增产化肥
    南京化学工业公司每天生产千吨化肥支援十九个省市
    新华社济南7日电　山东各地化学工业部门认真贯彻“以农业为基础”的方针，积极增产化肥，为当前农村夏种和棉花等秋季作物提供高效肥料。
    据统计，今年上半年全省化学工业部门已为农村生产了各种化肥十六万一千三百一十七吨，比去年同期增长四倍以上。其中以钾肥增长为最多，增长四十倍以上。各种化肥的质量也有显著提高。例如，磷肥的有效含磷量由14％提高到18％，最高达到20％。
    为了保证大量生产化肥，山东各地根据“土洋结合”的方针，开展了大办化工小土群的群众运动。最近一年来全省建成的各种化肥生产炉达四百多座，年产能力达二十多万吨。各县和大部分人民公社现在都有了自己的化肥厂。今年上半年小土群生产的化肥就占全省化肥总产量的三分之二以上。
    各地化工部门职工为了增产化肥，广泛开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，解决关键问题，从而使生产大幅度提高。郯城化工厂原来生产的钙镁磷肥，因为出炉后粒度坚硬，粉碎困难，全厂七十多人就有四十多人从事粉碎；现在由于创造了新的处理方法，已经取消了粉碎工序，不但节省了人力，还使化肥由原来的黑炭色粒状变成白色纤维状。文登肥料厂在生产过程中大搞综合利用，使每吨钙镁磷肥的成本降低了50％，平均日产量提高30％左右，有效含磷量也由10％提高到15％以上。
    新华社南京讯　南京化学工业公司职工千方百计增产化肥，上半年这个公司生产的过磷酸钙、硫酸铵、氨水与碳酸氢铵四种化肥的总产量已完成全年计划的60％，与去年同期相比多生产化肥十万吨。目前平均每天有一千多吨化肥通过船车源源运往全国十九个省市。
    这个公司职工把支援农业技术改造一直看成是自己的光荣职责。为了增产更多化肥以促进农业生产，他们广泛开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。矿肥厂普钙车间原料粉碎与成品进出等工段，原来大部分都用人工操作，经过技术改革，增加了机械设备，今年上半年过磷酸钙的产量比去年同期增加了一倍多，每吨过磷酸钙生产成本比去年降低了17％。碳酸氢铵厂职工抓住制氨、碳化、分离三大关键不断革新操作，使日产水平比去年年底提高了四倍半，四个月就完成了今年全年的生产计划。
    为了使生产出的化肥加速运往各地，赶上农时需要，职工们建立了从车间通向火车的机械化流水作业线，使装车量由每天装十五个车皮提高到四十个车皮。
