Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Liberation Army units stationed throughout the country are vigorously supporting agricultural production.

Troops stationed in the North China Plain organized various anti-drought and rush-planting forces, led by responsible comrades, to go deep into the communes and launch enthusiastic support activities. Troops in the Beijing area dispatched more than 8,000 officers and soldiers to support seven people's communes in the suburbs of Daxing and Tongxian to complete the task of transplanting 100,000 mu of paddy fields. Many troops stationed in Hebei Province have stopped their regular training, and go wherever the task of fighting drought and rush-planting is arduous to provide support. Officers and soldiers set off late at night, and upon arrival at their destination, they did not enter the village or rest, but put down their backpacks and immediately went to work in the fields. A support agriculture force personally led by the person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Military Region dug more than 190 large and small canals in three days, totaling more than 5,000 meters in length. PLA troops stationed along the Yangtze River also actively support rural communes in summer hoeing and planting. In the past half month alone, a certain unit in the Wuhan area contributed more than 20,000 workdays. On the Pearl River Delta, PLA officers and soldiers who once overcame floods with the people are now harvesting early rice with the people. The land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian Front are doing their best to support the people in areas affected by typhoons and rainstorms to restore and develop agricultural production, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

Actively helping rural people's communes carry out agricultural technical transformation and rapidly increasing agricultural output is one of the main contents of the People's Liberation Army's various special forces and technical departments in giving full play to their expertise to support agriculture. Troops in the Beijing area mobilized technical forces from all sides to help rural communes repair and assemble various irrigation machines, and impart technology to help train technical personnel. Many troops have established technical teams, repair teams, and expedition service teams, bringing their own tools to go to the countryside. A certain unit organized 17 repair teams to provide mobile repair services for the irrigation and drainage machinery of 72 production teams in five communes where they were stationed. An expedition service team of a certain unit went on five expeditions, repairing and manufacturing more than 200 kinds of parts for the commune, and training a group of technical personnel on their behalf. The "Mechanical and Electrical Training Class" run by a certain unit of the People's Air Force helped a commune, and after 20 days of training, all the more than 70 students who participated in the study learned the operating techniques of diesel engines and electric motors, solving the commune's difficulty of insufficient technical force.

In the recent period, medical personnel from various PLA units have also organized medical teams to go deep into the countryside to assist commune medical personnel in conducting mobile medical services.

　　人和机器一齐上　哪里需要到哪里
　　解放军广泛开展支援农业活动
    据新华社讯  中国人民解放军驻全国各地部队，大力支援农业生产。
    驻华北平原的部队组织了各路抗旱抢种大军，由负责同志带领，深入公社，展开热火朝天的支援活动。北京地区部队派出八千多名官兵，支援郊区大兴、通县的七个人民公社突击完成十万亩稻田的插秧任务。河北省驻军许多部队停止操课，哪里抗旱抢种的任务艰巨，就奔向哪里支援。官兵们深夜出发，到达目的地不进村，不休息，放下背包，立即下地干活。由河北省军区负责人亲自率领的一支支援农业大军，三天开挖大小水渠一百九十多条，共长五千多米。驻长江两岸的解放军部队，也积极支援农村公社夏锄、夏种，近半个月来，仅武汉地区某部队就作了两万多个劳动日。在珠江三角洲上，曾经和人民一道战胜了洪水的解放军官兵们，又和人民一起收割早稻。福建前线陆、海、空三军部队，全力支援遭受台风、暴雨地区人民恢复和发展农业生产，力争秋季大丰收。
    积极帮助农村人民公社进行农业技术改造，迅速提高农业产量，是人民解放军各特种兵部队和技术部门发挥专长，支援农业的主要内容之一。北京地区部队调动各方面的技术力量，帮助农村公社修配各种灌溉机具，并传授技术，帮助培养技术人才，许多部队都成立了技术组、抢修组、远征服务队，自带工具下农村。某部组织了十七个抢修小组，为驻地五个公社的七十二个生产队，巡回修理排灌机械。某部的一支远征服务队五次远征，为公社修理和配制各种机件二百多件，并代训了一批技术人员。人民空军某部帮助一个公社开办的“机电训练班”，经过二十天训练，使参加学习的七十多个学员全部学会了柴油机和电动机的操作技术，解决了公社技术力量不足的困难。
    解放军各部队的医务人员在最近也纷纷组织医疗队，深入农村，协助公社医务人员进行巡回医疗。
