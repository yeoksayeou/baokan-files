    Reaching a New Level: Good is Not Good Enough
    Letters Regarding the "Learn from Huanghua Saltworks" Editorial
    The People's Daily published the editorial and news report "Learn from Huanghua Saltworks" on June 19th, which greatly encouraged all our workers. On June 20th, the news spread like wildfire to every corner of the saltworks. People gathered, reading the People's Daily aloud, and the radio station broadcast it. It was truly a day of great joy for the saltworks. The Party Committee of the saltworks held a telephone conference on the evening of the day they saw the People's Daily, and redeployed the work. After thorough discussion and careful accounting, a new leap forward plan was formulated, and it was decided to achieve the target of "completing a year's task in half a year." The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee called on everyone: we must redouble our efforts, strive to create greater achievements, and respond to the care shown to us by the Party newspaper.
    In order to substantially overfulfill the state plan, our saltworks put forward the slogan of seizing the key and bravely breaking through "three barriers" early on in the peak salt production season. The first barrier was the water barrier: the evaporation rate is high and the water source is insufficient during the peak season. We adopted a combination of mechanical pumping and natural pumping methods, so that the natural tidal inflow accounted for more than 20% of the total tidal inflow, ensuring the needs of brine production. The second barrier was the power barrier: by finding tricks and tapping potential, we adopted horizontal installation of water pumps, which resulted in a small six-horsepower machine replacing a twenty-five-horsepower machine, and it drove a large 350-centimeter water pump. This solved the contradiction of having small machines but no large water pumps, and having large water pumps but no large machines, giving full play to the potential of the power supply. All ten small machines and ten large water pumps were put into use, ensuring the needs of pumping and stirring brine; Thirdly, we fiercely broke through the technical barrier: in response to the low technical level of the workers, leaders at all levels held more than 20 technical performance experience exchange on-site meetings and production competitions to select ten pacesetters in the four main processes of salt raking, salt scooping, residue removal, and salt drying. A movement of learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping was carried out throughout the saltworks. Climate change has a great impact on salt production. In order to overcome nature, all workers generally paid attention to meteorology, and everyone created more than 20 kinds of indigenous meteorological instruments, such as salty-light mud balls, salty cucumbers, and mud loaches, totaling more than 1,300 pieces; close combination with weather forecasts played a great role in grasping weather changes, ensuring full utilization of good weather and windy days, rushing to produce brine, strengthening crystallization management, and overcoming rainy days to avoid natural disasters.
    Recently, the workers have been even more enthusiastic. As soon as you get up in the morning, you can't even see a shadow of anyone in the dormitory, everyone has already gone to production. In the Party Committee office, letters of determination are flying in like snowflakes, and some people have written poems like this on their letters of determination: "Add fuel to the fire, the flames soar high, a heart full of enthusiasm to show heroism; heroes have lofty ambitions, to build socialism and make contributions." Due to the efforts of all the workers, production has risen sharply. As of June 24th, the saltworks had produced more than 171,200 tons of crude salt, completing the annual state plan six days earlier than half a year. At present, all the workers are still working hard with the spirit of continuous revolution to strive for greater achievements. Zhang Shanming

### 更上一层楼  好了还要好  关于“向黄骅盐场看齐”社论的来信

    更上一层楼  好了还要好
    关于“向黄骅盐场看齐”社论的来信
    人民日报6月19日发表了“向黄骅盐场看齐”的社论和消息，给我们全场职工极大鼓舞。6月20日那一天，这个消息像长了翅膀一样，传遍了各个角落。人们簇拥着，高声朗读着当天的人民日报，广播站也在广播。这一天，真是盐场的大喜日子。场党委会，在看到人民日报那天晚上，就召开了电话会议，重新布置了工作。经过充分讨论和算细账制订出新的跃进计划，并且决定实现“一年任务半年完成”的指标。党委副书记号召大家：一定要把干劲鼓得更足，争取创造更大成绩，来回答党报对我们的关怀。
    我们场为了大幅度超额完成国家计划，早在进入制盐旺季以来，就提出了狠抓关键，猛闯“三关”的口号。第一关是闯水关：旺产季节蒸发量大，水源不足。我们采取了机器扬水和自然扬水相结合的办法，使自然纳潮水量占纳潮总水量20％以上，保证了制卤生产的需要。第二是闯动力关：通过找窍门挖潜力，采取卧式安装水泵结果使六马力的小机器代替二十五马力机器，并且它带动了三百五十厘米的大水泵，解决了有小机器没有大水泵，有大水泵没有大机器的矛盾，发挥了动力的潜力，把十台小机器十台大水泵全部利用起来，保证了扬水和捣卤的需要；第三，猛闯技术关：针对工人技术水平低的特点，各级领导分别召开二十多次技术表演经验交流现场会议，生产运动比武选拔赛，选拔了扒盐、抅盐、活渣、?盐等四道主要工序上的十名标兵，在全场开展了学、赶、超、帮的运动。气候的变化，对盐业生产影响很大。为了战胜自然，全场职工普遍抓气象，人人创造土法观天的咸淡泥球、咸黄瓜、泥秋鱼等二十多种、一千三百多件土仪器；密切结合气象预报，对掌握天气变化保证充分利用好天和大风天，突击制卤，加强结晶管理，战胜阴雨天避免自然灾害起了很大作用。
    最近，职工们干劲更大。一早起来，宿舍里连个人影子都看不到，大家早就生产去了。在党委办公室里，决心书像雪片一样飞来，有的人在决心书上写下了这样的诗句：“火上浇油焰火高，满腔热血逞英豪；英雄立下凌云志，建设社会主义立功劳。”由于全场职工的努力，生产直线上升，截至6月24日止，全场生产了原盐十七万一千二百多吨，提前半年零六天，完成了全年国家计划。目前全场职工还在以不断革命的精神，为争取更大的成绩而努力。张善明
