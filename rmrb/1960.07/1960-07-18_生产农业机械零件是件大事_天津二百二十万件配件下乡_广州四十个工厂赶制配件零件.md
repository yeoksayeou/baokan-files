Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th: Guided by the idea that "agriculture is the foundation," Tianjin's agricultural machinery industry conscientiously implements the spirit of the nation as a whole and produces accessories for tractors, internal combustion engines, and trucks in greater quantities, faster, and better. In the first half of this year, factories produced 61 varieties and more than 200 specifications of accessories, totaling more than 2.2 million units (pieces), for agricultural machinery factories and rural people's communes across the country for supporting and maintenance purposes. Compared with the same period last year, the quantity has increased more than seven times, and the variety of specifications has increased by more than 100.

Most of the dozen or so factories in Tianjin that produce agricultural machinery accessories such as tractors and internal combustion engines were merged and reorganized from handicraft production cooperatives two years ago. This year, various regions have vigorously supported agricultural mechanization, and the production of tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery has developed rapidly, and the accessories required for supporting and maintenance have also increased accordingly. In order to adapt to this need, the Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Industry Bureau first started with ideological education, educating cadres and workers in each factory to recognize the overall situation, take care of the overall situation, treat accessories as complete products, and repeatedly explain the importance of accessories. At the same time, the workers of each factory personally witnessed the huge role of accessories in drought resistance during their in-depth visits to the countryside to help the people's communes repair irrigation and drainage machinery. The workers of each factory unanimously proposed: "Produce whatever the country needs, and are determined to complete the output value plan on the basis of ensuring the completion of the product output plan."

In order to give full play to the production capacity of each factory, the Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Industry Bureau made unified plans for the production of major accessories based on the production conditions such as equipment and technology of each factory, and determined two or three major accessories for each factory as the factory's directional products. This not only eliminated the past phenomenon that several factories produced one product, and some products were not produced by anyone, but also enabled each factory to concentrate its efforts on continuously increasing new specifications of products and improving product quality around the main products.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: Guangzhou's electromechanical industry is carrying forward the spirit of communist cooperation and actively producing accessories and parts for agricultural machinery. At present, more than 40 machine factories in the city have been organized and are rushing to produce more than 100 kinds of agricultural machinery accessories and more than 500 kinds of parts.

In some machine factories in Guangzhou, under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers in the factories producing accessories realized through discussions that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy, and supporting agriculture is of great significance to promoting the overall development of the entire national economy. They unanimously stated that they would do everything possible to complete the production tasks of agricultural machinery and equipment accessories.

In the process of producing various agricultural machinery parts, many factories have demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation and supported each other. The tractor accessory bearing brackets produced by Guangzhou Limin Automobile Parts Factory could not be assembled and shipped because of the lack of screws. Guangzhou Minsheng Iron Factory specially processed screws for them, so that the bearing brackets were assembled and shipped on time. The gate lifting machines, valves and other water conservancy engineering equipment produced by Guangzhou Shenglong Hardware Structure Factory also lacked screws of various specifications, and could not be matched into sets. Other machine factories in the city went all out to rush to produce screws for them, so that the matching problem was quickly solved.

### 生产农业机械零件是件大事　天津二百二十万件配件下乡　广州四十个工厂赶制配件零件

　　生产农业机械零件是件大事
　　天津二百二十万件配件下乡　广州四十个工厂赶制配件零件
    新华社天津17日电　天津市农业机械行业在“农业是基础”的思想指导下，认真贯彻全国一盘棋的精神，又多又快又好地生产拖拉机、内燃机和载重汽车等配件。今年上半年，各厂为全国各地生产了六十一个品种共二百多种规格的配件，总数达二百二十多万台
  （件），供各地农业机械厂、农村人民公社配套和维修用；同去年同期相比，数量增加了七倍多，品种规格增加了一百多种。
    天津市生产拖拉机和内燃机等农业机械配件的十几个工厂，大部分是在两年前由手工业生产合作社合并改组而成的。今年各地大力支援农业机械化，拖拉机和排灌机械的生产发展很快，需要配套和维修的配件也相应的增加很多。为适应这种需要，天津市农业机械工业局首先从思想教育着手，教育各厂干部和职工识大体，顾全局，把配件当作成套产品看待，反复说明配件的重要性。同时，各厂职工在深入农村帮助人民公社抢修排灌机械的过程中亲眼看到配件用于抗旱的巨大作用。各厂职工一致提出：“国家需要什么就生产什么，决心在保证完成产品产量计划的基础上完成产值计划。”
    为了使各厂的生产能力得到充分发挥，天津市农业机械工业局根据各厂的设备和技术等生产条件，对主要配件的生产作了统一规划，每个工厂分别确定了两三种主要配件作为本厂的方向产品。这样，不仅消灭了过去存在的一种产品数厂生产，而有些产品又无人生产的现象，而且还使各厂能够集中力量，围绕主要产品不断增加新规格的产品，提高产品质量。
    据新华社广州17日电　广州市机电行业发扬共产主义协作精神，积极为农业机械配套生产配件和零件。目前全市已组织四十多家机器厂，正在赶制一百多种农业机械配件和五百多种零件。
    广州市有些机器厂，在党组织的领导下，生产配件工厂的职工们通过讨论，认识到农业是发展国民经济的基础，支援农业对促进整个国民经济的全面发展，有着重要的意义，一致表示要千方百计完成农业机械设备配件生产任务。
    在生产各种农业机械零件的过程中，不少工厂发挥共产主义协作精神，彼此支援。广州利民汽车零件厂生产的拖拉机配件轴承托，因为缺乏螺丝而不能装配出厂，广州民生铁工厂就专门为他们加工螺丝，使轴承托按时装配出厂。广州生隆五金结构厂生产的起闸门机、阀门等水利工程设备，也因为缺乏各种规格的螺丝，配不成套，市内其他的机器厂就全力以赴地为他们突击生产螺丝，使配套问题迅速解决。
