Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The Ministry of Agriculture notified the agricultural bureaus (departments) of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have not yet completed their summer planting tasks to seize the agricultural season and rush to plant late autumn crops.

The notice stated: According to reports from various regions on July 10th, some summer fields across the country have not yet been planted. The agricultural season is now pressing, and it is hoped that a concentrated effort will be made to complete and overfulfill the summer planting tasks by all means.

　　1. Areas north of the Yangtze River should strive to complete summer planting before the Great Heat. Recently rained areas should, under the leadership of the Party, mobilize the masses to seize the opportunity to plant. Areas where the drought has not yet been relieved should resist the drought and sow, striving to plant as much as possible. If, despite maximum efforts, planting cannot be completed before the Great Heat, early-maturing crops, melons, vegetables, radishes, and feed crops should be replanted. In the north, some spring-sown crops have suffered from severe lack of seedlings due to drought, and intercropping and relay intercropping should be carried out without delaying the farming season. Summer-sown crops with incomplete emergence or no emergence should be replanted as soon as possible.

　　2. The main task of summer planting south of the Yangtze River is grain crops. Under the leadership of the Party, all possible labor must be concentrated, and support must be obtained from urban residents, cadres of organizations, students, and other sectors to strive to complete planting before the Beginning of Autumn.

Now is also the busy season for field management of major autumn crops. While completing summer planting, all regions must also seize the opportunity to carry out mid-cultivation and weeding of major autumn crops, fight against pests, diseases, drought, and flood disasters, and vigorously accumulate and create fertilizers, applying sufficient topdressing to strive for a bumper harvest.

　　抓紧季节抢种晚秋作物
　  农业部通知各地立即集中力量突击完成夏种任务
　　要求长江以北地区在大暑以前、长江以南地区在立秋以前种完
    新华社13日讯　农业部通知目前还未完成夏种任务的各省、市、自治区农业厅（局），抓紧农事季节抢种晚秋作物。
    通知说：据7月10日各地反映，全国还有部分夏田没有种上。现在农事季节紧迫，望即进行突击，尽一切努力，完成和超额完成夏种任务。
    一、长江以北地区的夏种力争在大暑以前种完。最近降雨地区，应在党的领导下，发动群众趁雨抢种。旱情尚未解除地区，要抗旱播种，力争多种。如经最大努力大暑以前未能种下的，应该补种早熟作物、瓜菜、萝卜及饲料作物等。北方还有部分春播作物因旱缺苗严重，应该不误农时的进行间种套种。夏播作物出苗不全和未出苗的要尽快补种。
    二、长江以南的夏种任务主要是粮食作物，必须在党的领导下集中一切可能集中的劳力，并取得城镇居民、机关干部、学生等各方面的支援，力争在立秋前种完。
    现在也是大秋作物田间管理的紧张季节。各地在完成夏种的同时，还须抓紧大秋作物的中耕锄草，和病虫旱涝灾害作斗争，并大力积肥造肥，施足追肥，争取丰收。
