    Seeing for Oneself is Better Than Hearing Reports
    Pan Jiuzhou, Secretary of the Xiji Commune Party Committee, Lushan, Henan

    In the past, I often led production in one area or one large team, but I did not often participate in production myself. Therefore, I formed the habit of believing reports from below without verification, and often failed to take the initiative in my work. Since implementing the "two-five system" leadership method, the work situation has changed. Recently, I went deep into the Penguo Brigade, personally participating in production with the commune members, listening to the situation below. I discovered that the brigade's cultivated land area was more than 200 mu less than in 1958. It turned out that brigade committee member Cui Jinqing believed that it was better to cultivate one mu of good land than three mu of poor and distant land, so he abandoned the distant land. After discovering this situation, I immediately organized brigade and production team cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to investigate ridge by ridge and gully by gully. In half a day, we found 164 mu of idle cultivated land and 92 mu of wasteland that could be reclaimed. The commune members all said, "This is land returned and grain stored!"

    亲眼看看胜过听汇报
    河南鲁山辛集公社党委书记　潘九洲
    过去，我经常在一个片或一个大队领导生产，但并没有经常参加生产，因此形成了下边报一是一，偏听偏信，工作往往不能打主动仗。推行“二五制”领导方法以来，工作情况改变了。最近我深入到盆郭大队，亲身和社员一道参加生产，倾听下情，发现了该大队耕地面积比1958年少了二百多亩。原来大队委员崔金庆认为好地种一亩是一亩，远地又薄又赖，三亩不顶一亩，所以把远地丢了。我发现了这种情况以后，马上组织大队、生产队干部、老农、技术员，岭岭查、沟沟找，半天工夫就找出了荒闲耕地一百六十四亩，能开垦的荒地九十二亩。社员们都说：“这是土地还原、粮食归仓了。”
