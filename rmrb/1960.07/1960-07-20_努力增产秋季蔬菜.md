    Strive to Increase Autumn Vegetable Production
    On February 18th of this year, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on current vegetable work, calling on Party committees and People's Committees in all cities and rural areas to seize the opportunity for spring vegetable production and make arrangements for vegetable work throughout the year. All parts of the country have implemented these instructions, earnestly strengthened leadership over vegetable production, and achieved great success in vegetable production and supply. For example, Hebei Province planted more than 3.84 million mu of spring and summer vegetables this year, an increase of 62% over the same period last year. In addition, 9.83 million mu were interplanted and intercropped, and 3.57 million mu of newly reclaimed wasteland and scattered land were used for vegetable cultivation, ensuring the supply of vegetables in the spring and summer seasons this year.
    Autumn is the most important vegetable production season. The vegetables eaten by the vast majority of urban and rural people in autumn, winter, and the following spring are mostly planted in autumn. On July 19th, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued further instructions on autumn vegetable production. The instructions pointed out: "This year's autumn vegetable production is of greater significance than in previous years. Doing a good job in this year's autumn vegetable production can not only basically ensure the vegetable needs of urban and rural people in autumn, winter, and next spring, but also provide favorable conditions for further improving canteens and promoting their continued consolidation and development. At the same time, a large increase in autumn vegetable production can also effectively prevent disasters and prepare for famine in some areas where droughts and floods occur." Many vivid examples prove the correctness of this instruction from the Central Committee and the State Council. Vegetables are a major issue concerning the lives of 650 million people. Now, more than 90% of the rural population has joined public canteens, and more and more urban residents are participating in public canteens. While rapidly developing grain production, growing more vegetables and supplying more and better vegetables year-round has become the key to better arranging the lives of the masses. This year, the vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of Jilin City, Jilin Province, has expanded by 90% compared with last year, and the number of vegetable varieties has increased by 77. Since June of this year, urban residents have been able to eat 1.2 jin of fresh vegetables per person per day. The Shibu Brigade of the Jinshan Commune in Ganyu County, Jiangsu, resolutely implemented the call issued by the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the CCP to produce "1,000 jin of vegetables before wheat, 1,000 jin of melons after wheat, and 1,000 jin of carrots after autumn." This brigade reaped a great harvest of melons and vegetables in the first half of this year, and together with the dried vegetables stored in the past, each person could eat an average of four jin of vegetables per day; they could also sell some of what they could not eat. In Ping Shan County, Sichuan Province, the Longchuan Commune planted many vegetables this year, and they grew well. All public canteens can ensure that each person has three to five jin of fresh vegetables to eat every day. The commune members eat very well and also save grain. With more vegetables, the problem of pig feed is also easy to solve. The steel plant management area of this commune has more than 120 pigs that are fattened with vegetable stems and leaves. Vegetables have also played a huge role in famine preparedness. Because vegetables have a very high yield per unit area and a very short production cycle, they are good things for disaster prevention and famine preparedness. The Sihaiqiao Team of the Guanghua Brigade of the Beipo Commune in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, suffered a severe drought last year, and the autumn grain production was reduced, and the rations for the commune members were not sufficient. This team vigorously grasped vegetable production starting in August last year, expanding the vegetable area to 70 mu (including 40 mu of interplanted vegetables), and adding 28 mu of vegetables in winter, averaging 0.3 mu of vegetable land per person. They planted and harvested every month, averaging three jin of vegetables per person per day, and up to eight jin at most. They implemented a mixed grain and vegetable diet, and the commune members were very satisfied and highly motivated to produce.
    Now, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council have issued instructions on autumn vegetable production, requiring Party committees and People's Committees at all levels to seize this opportunity and take immediate action to do a good job in autumn vegetable production. The instructions pointed out: "While taking grain as the key link and first rapidly developing grain production, we must vigorously develop vegetable production to better arrange the lives of 650 million people. This is a major economic task for all Party comrades, all state workers, and the people of the whole country, and it is also a major political task." All regions should, in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, check the vegetable planting plans in their regions and make active and reliable arrangements for this year's autumn vegetable production. At present, the preliminary arrangements for autumn vegetable acreage in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces are more than double that of last year. This approach is very necessary. In order to increase autumn vegetable production, it is first necessary to ensure the sown area and strive to plant more and plant enough. In addition to making full use of autumn fallow fields to grow vegetables on a large scale, intercropping, interplanting, mixed planting, and other methods can also be adopted, and more vegetables can be planted by utilizing the edges of fields, corners of land, woodlands, wasteland, and courtyards. One can never have too many vegetables, the more the better. With fresh vegetables, there will also be dried vegetables. With surplus vegetables, there will also be sufficient feed.
    Vegetable planting is highly seasonal. Missing a few days can reduce the harvest by several tens of percent. All regions should resolutely implement this instruction from the Central Committee and the State Council, allocate sufficient labor to vegetable production, and organize vegetable specialized production teams. When planting and harvesting vegetables, all available labor should be transferred to the vegetable production front. Government offices, organizations, factories, schools, and troops should support agriculture, and at present, they should first support vegetable production and transport all available manpower, technical forces, machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides to the countryside. As long as a mass vegetable production movement on a national scale is launched, we will definitely be able to obtain more and better vegetables, and we will definitely be able to victoriously complete this major economic task and major political task called on by the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the entire Party and the entire people to complete.

    努力增产秋季蔬菜
    今年2月18日，中共中央和国务院发出了关于当前蔬菜工作的指示，号召所有的城市和农村的党委和人民委员会，抓紧春季蔬菜生产，同时作好全年蔬菜工作的安排。全国各地贯彻执行这个指示，认真加强了对于蔬菜生产的领导，在蔬菜生产、供应等方面，都取得了很大的成绩。例如，河北省今年种的春菜、夏菜有三百八十四万多亩，比去年同期增加了62％。此外，还间种、套种九百八十三万亩，利用新垦荒地和零散土地种菜三百五十七万亩，保证了今年春夏两季的蔬菜供应。
    秋季是最重要的蔬菜生产季节。全国绝大多数城乡人民秋季、冬季和来年春季吃的蔬菜，多是在秋季种的。7月19日，中共中央、国务院又发出了关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示。指示指出：“今年秋菜生产比往年有更大的意义。搞好今年的秋菜生产，不但可以基本上保证城市和乡村人民秋季、冬季和明年春季的蔬菜需要，而且可以为进一步办好食堂提供有利条件，促进食堂的继续巩固和发展。同时，大量增产秋菜，也可以在某些地方发生旱涝灾害的情况下，有效地防灾备荒。”很多生动的事例证明中央和国务院这一指示的正确。蔬菜是关系六亿五千万人民生活的一件大事。现在百分之九十几的农村人口已经加入公共食堂，城市居民参加公共食堂的也越来越多。在迅速发展粮食生产的同时，多种蔬菜，常年供应更多更好的蔬菜，就成为更好地安排群众生活的关键。今年，吉林省吉林市郊区蔬菜播种面积比去年扩大90％，蔬菜品种增加了七十七种。今年6月以来，市区居民每人每天可以吃到一斤二两鲜菜。江苏赣榆县金山公社石埠大队坚决贯彻中共徐州地委发出的“麦前千斤菜，麦后千斤瓜，秋后千斤胡萝卜”的号召，今年上半年获得瓜菜大丰收，连同过去储备的干菜在内，每人每天平均能吃四斤菜；自己吃不完，还能出售一部分。四川屏山县龙川公社今年蔬菜种得多，长得好，所有公共食堂都能保证每人每天有三、五斤鲜菜吃，社员吃得很好，还节省了粮食。菜多了，猪的饲料问题也容易解决了。这个公社的钢厂管理区有一百二十多头猪是靠菜茎菜叶喂肥的。在备荒方面，蔬菜也发挥了巨大的作用。因为蔬菜的单位产量很高，生产周期很短，是防灾备荒的好东西。湖北省武昌县北坡公社光华大队四海桥小队，去年遭受严重干旱，秋粮减产，社员口粮不够充裕。这个小队从去年8月起大抓蔬菜生产，蔬菜面积扩大到七十亩（其中包括套种蔬菜四十亩），冬季又增种蔬菜二十八亩，平均每人有三分菜地。月月种，月月收，平均每人每天有三斤菜，最多时有八斤菜。他们实行粮菜混吃，社员吃得很满意，生产积极性很高。
    现在，中共中央和国务院又发出关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示，要求各级党委和人民委员会抓紧这个时机，立即行动起来，作好秋季蔬菜生产工作，指示指出：“必须在以粮为纲、首先迅速发展粮食生产的同时，大力发展蔬菜生产，更好地安排六亿五千万人民的生活。这是全党同志、全体国家工作人员和全国人民的一项重大的经济任务，也是一项重大的政治任务。”各个地区应该根据这个指示的精神，对本地区的蔬菜种植计划加以检查，积极可靠地安排今年秋季的蔬菜生产。现在，河北、河南、山东等省初步安排的秋菜面积，都比去年扩大一倍以上。这种作法是很必要的。为了增产秋季蔬菜，首先要保证播种面积，力争多种、种足。除了充分利用秋闲田大种蔬菜以外，还可以采取套种、间种、混种等方法，并且利用田边、地角、林地、荒地、院地多种蔬菜。菜不厌多，多多益善。有了鲜菜，也就有了干菜。有了多余的蔬菜，也就有了丰足的饲料。
    蔬菜种植有很强的季节性，错过几天的时间，就可能降低几成收成。各地应该坚决执行中央和国务院这一指示，调配足够的劳动力投入蔬菜生产，把蔬菜专业生产队组织起来。在种菜、收菜的时候，更要把一切可以抽调的劳动力调到蔬菜生产战线上去。机关、团体、工厂、学校、部队都要支援农业，在目前首先要支援蔬菜生产，把可以动用的人力、技术力量、机械、肥料、农药输送到农村去。只要掀起了全民规模的蔬菜生产运动，我们一定可以拿到更多、更好的蔬菜，一定可以胜利地完成党中央和国务院号召全党全民完成的这一项重大的经济任务和重大的政治任务。
