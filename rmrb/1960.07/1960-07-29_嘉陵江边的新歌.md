    New Song by the Jialing River
    Man Shanqing
    A foster daughter should not be married to Lian'an Township,
    Ten ridges, nine barren.
    This folk song, I don't know how many years it has circulated along the Jialing River.

    The beautiful Jialing River, like a long, light blue brocade, quietly flows south. The land it flows through is mostly fertile fields, but there are also poor and desolate places. The Jialing River flows into Wusheng, Sichuan, and makes a large circle. The land within this large circle is thin and barren, covered with pebbles, and does not grow crops. Every year, some peas and sweet potatoes are planted, but often no harvest is obtained. During the reactionary rule, landlords cruelly exploited the peasants, and the local people lived in extreme poverty. Parents from other places could not bear to marry their daughters here to suffer from cold and hunger; the young men here were burdened with life-long labor, and some had no way to marry even after they turned thirty-seven or thirty-eight. After liberation, through cooperativization, although production has greatly improved, it has not fundamentally changed the past situation. This place was the former Lian'an Township in Wusheng. The current Lian'an Township, having established a people's commune, has fundamentally changed its appearance.

    In the early summer morning of May, the members of the Lian'an Commune, each joyful and energetic, faced the rising sun, stepped on the glistening dewdrops, and entered the golden wheat fields, waving their sickles to reclaim the rich fruits they had earned with their labor. The young men and women, humming songs praising the commune, occasionally looked up from the wheat stalks, smiling and looking at each other. The old production team leader, facing this scene of joy, was planning a happy event: to hold a wedding for his son.

    The old production team leader, He Shaoyuan, was a lean and capable old man in his fifties with some graying whiskers. He had tasted all the bitter flavors of life. When he was very young, he herded cattle for the landlord. Later, he worked as a tenant farmer, pulled boats, and went down to the gold mines to pan for gold. He did not get married and settle down until he was over thirty. People who have suffered enough bitterness are most likely to appreciate the taste of sweetness. Last autumn, the commune party committee called for taming the poor mountains and wild ridges and eradicating the root of poverty. As soon as the old team leader heard this news, he was full of energy, and led more than twenty members of the production team to join the battle of attacking the mountains and changing the soil. Everyone got up early and went to bed late, moving stones and carrying soil. After a few days of intensive labor, they transformed a barren hill covered with pebbles into a fertile plain with a thick soil layer. This year, wheat grew here for the first time, with long and large ears, dancing in the wind.

    The first good harvest was enough to make people happy. When they heard that the old team leader's family was taking a bride, everyone was even more delighted. After work, they hurried to tidy up and dress up to congratulate them. The young men and women of the commune's cultural troupe, bringing their erhu and flute, also rushed over. The old team leader wore a new blue cloth suit, his mouth curved into a smile, nodding to receive the guests who came to congratulate him.

    As soon as the guests arrived, they started helping: hanging a portrait of Chairman Mao straight on the wall, then pushing the dining table to the back, and shining a bright gas lamp, the collective canteen became an auditorium.

    The wedding began, and Secretary Zhang of the commune party committee took the stage to speak. He said: "This year, good crops have grown on Guangpo Ridge. This, combined with the old He family taking a bride, is called 'double happiness'. In the past, girls from other places were unwilling to marry into Lian'an Township, but now..." Before Secretary Zhang finished speaking, everyone laughed. The bride, wearing a red floral dress, blushed and quickly lowered her head, just smiling with pursed lips. It turned out that this eighteen-year-old bride was a girl from another place. Her family lived in Shipan Commune in Yuechi, a place with good soil and good produce, eight or nine miles away from Lian'an Commune. A few months ago, she was introduced to the old team leader's son. The old team leader's son, He Xiant, is just twenty years old this year. He is a hardworking and simple young man, a "Five-Good Commune Member" in the commune, and has received many awards. In the movement to attack the mountains and change the soil, he was the most outstanding labor pacesetter. The girl came here once and fell deeply in love with the land of this place, the crops of this place, and even more in love with the soaring energy of the people of this place. She quickly got engaged to the young man of the He family. Secretary Zhang continued: "Now it seems that the folk song 'A foster daughter should not be married to Lian'an Township, ten ridges, nine barren' should be outdated and abolished." Another burst of hearty laughter rose in the room. Several old women chuckled softly and said: "Look at that Secretary Zhang, he really knows how to turn old sayings around!"

    Then, the young men and women of the cultural troupe sang a song of praise:
    The Jialing River flows long and long,
    On the shore is Lian'an Township,
    Wheat and rapeseed have a bumper harvest,
    Now Lian'an has greatly changed.…………

    The joyful singing made people's hearts bloom. The old team leader listened to the song, looked at the fellow villagers in the room, and looked at his son and daughter-in-law sitting side by side in front of him. He suddenly raised his head, looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, and felt how happy he was!

    嘉陵江边的新歌
    满山青
    养女莫嫁礼安乡，
    十个梁子九个光。
    这首歌谣，不知在嘉陵江边流传过多少年。
    秀丽的嘉陵江，像一幅浅蓝色的长锦，静静地向南流去，它流过的土地，大都是沃土良田，却也有贫穷荒凉的地方。嘉陵江流入四川武胜境内，绕了一个大圈，这个大圈子里的土地，又薄又瘦，遍地鹅卵石，不长庄稼，每年种上点豌豆、红苕，常常得不到收成。在反动统治时期，地主残酷剥削农民，当地人民生活苦极了。外地作父母的，不忍心把自己的女儿嫁到这里来挨冻受饿；这里的年轻小伙子，终年为生活劳累，有的满过三十七、八岁，还没法娶亲。解放以后，经过合作化，虽然生产有了很大的提高，但仍未根本改变过去的情况。这地方，就是武胜过去的礼安乡。现在的礼安乡，办起人民公社，已经根本改变样子了。
    初夏五月的早晨，礼安公社的社员们，个个喜气洋洋，迎着初升的太阳，踏着晶莹的露水珠，走进金波起伏的麦田，挥动镰刀，向土地索回自己用勤劳换来的丰硕果实。小伙子和姑娘们，哼着赞美公社的歌曲，不时从麦穗丛中抬起头来，微笑着彼此张望。老生产队长面对这一片欢乐的景况，心里正筹划着一件喜事：为儿子举行婚礼。
    老生产队长何绍远，是个五十多岁留着些花白胡须的精干老人，他曾尝尽了人世间的辛酸滋味。很小他就给地主家放牛，后来，当过佃户，拉过船，下过金洞淘金，三十多岁才娶亲安家。吃够了苦的人，最容易领会到甜的滋味。去年秋天，公社党委号召驯服穷山野岭，挖绝穷根。老队长一听这消息，浑身是劲，带着生产队的二十多个社员，投入了这场攻山改土的战斗。人人起早睡晚，搬石挑土，经过几天紧张的劳动，就把一片鹅卵石纵横的荒丘，变成了土层肥厚的平坝。今年，这里第一次长出了小麦，麦穗长得又长又大，迎风起舞。
    第一个好收成，就够人们欢乐了，再听说老队长家娶媳妇，大家更高兴得了不得，收了工就忙着收拾打扮，赶来祝贺。公社文工团的小伙子和姑娘们，带上胡琴、笛子，也赶了来。老队长穿一身青布新衣，笑弯了嘴角，点头接待来祝贺的客人。
    客人们一来就动手帮忙：在墙上端端正正挂张毛主席像，再把饭桌往后边一顺，照上雪亮的煤气灯，集体食堂就变成了礼堂。
    婚礼开始，公社党委张书记上台讲话，他说：“今年光坡梁子长出了好庄稼。这跟老何家娶媳妇合在一起，就叫‘双喜临门’。过去，外地姑娘不肯嫁到礼安乡来，现在不了……”张书记的话还没有讲完，大家都笑了起来。穿着一身红花衣衫的新娘子，刷的红了脸，赶快低下头去，只顾抿着嘴笑。原来，这十八岁的新娘子就是外地来的姑娘，她家住在岳池的石盘公社，那是个土质好、出产好的地方，隔礼安公社有八、九里路程。几个月以前，她才被人介绍跟老队长的儿子认识。老队长的儿子何先堤，今年刚好二十岁，是个勤劳朴实的小伙子，公社的“五好社员”，曾获得过许多次奖励，在攻山改土的运动中，他是一名最出色的劳动标兵。姑娘来过这里一次，就深深爱上了这地方的土地，这地方的庄稼，更爱上了这地方人们的冲天干劲。她很快就跟何家小伙子订了婚。张书记继续说：“现在看来，‘养女莫嫁礼安乡，十个梁子九个光’这歌谣，应该过时作废了。”屋子里又扬起一阵爽朗的笑声。有几个老大娘，轻声地啧啧笑着说道：“看那张书记，真会翻老话哩！”
    接着，文工团的小伙子和姑娘们，唱起一支赞歌：
    嘉陵江水长又长，
    岸上有个礼安乡，
    小麦油菜齐丰收，
    如今礼安大变样。…………
    欢乐的歌声，唱得人们心花怒放。老队长听着歌，望了望满屋的乡亲，望了望并肩坐在面前的儿子和儿媳，他忽然抬起头来，看着挂在墙上的毛主席像，感到自己多么幸福！
