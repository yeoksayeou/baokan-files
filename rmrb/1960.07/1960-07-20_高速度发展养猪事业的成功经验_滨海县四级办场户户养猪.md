Our newspaper, Nanjing, July 19th -- Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, has created a successful experience in the high-speed development of pig raising. This experience is "four-level farm management, five-level pig raising." Because it fully embodies the central government's policy of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, public and private raising side by side," according to statistics from early July, the county's total number of live pigs reached 481,000, a net increase of more than two times compared to before June of last year. Among them, collectively raised pigs account for 66.1% of the total, and pigs raised privately by commune members account for 33.9%. Based on the county's 157,000 households, the average number of pigs raised per household reaches 3.1.

The biggest feature of "four-level farm management, five-level pig raising" is that each level has its own division of labor and cooperates with each other. The pig farms run by the county level mainly focus on breeding improved varieties and fattening commodity pigs. The pig farms run by the communes focus on both breeding improved varieties and breeding piglets; the pig farms run by the brigades mainly focus on breeding piglets, supplemented by fattening; the pig farms run by the teams mainly focus on fattening, supplemented by breeding. With the county, commune, brigade, and team levels running pig farms, plus every public canteen and every household of commune members raising pigs privately, this constitutes five-level pig raising. Public canteens and commune members only raise fattening pigs and do not raise sows. Because each level of pig raising has a clear division of labor, achieving a combination of large, medium, and small, a mass pig-raising movement has been formed on the basis of collective pig raising as the guiding force.

In order to accelerate the development of collective pig raising, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the county, commune, and brigade-level pig farms, the Binhai County Party Committee also focused particularly on collective pig raising by the teams, because team-run pig farms have many favorable conditions: the scale of pig raising is small, and funds and materials are easy to raise and solve; a few acres of land can be skillfully planted using the canteen's vegetable base and "ten edges," which can solve the canteen's vegetables and also solve the pig feed; building farms in the fields facilitates fertilization. Therefore, some people call team-run pig farms the "small native groups" in the collective pig-raising cause, which are important links in developing pig raising rapidly, efficiently, and economically at present. As early as September last year, the county party committee saw these favorable conditions and immediately took the following four measures: (1) The 450 Party committee secretaries and branch secretaries in charge of animal husbandry in the county's communes and brigades went deep into the teams with relatively poor foundations to carry out experimental fields for team-run farms, check work, help solve problems, and promote the balanced development of pig raising in the teams. (2) Fully supply sows to the teams to support the teams in self-breeding and self-raising. (3) Allocate dedicated feed land to the team-run pig farms. More than 40,000 mu have been allocated throughout the county and planted with various high-yield feeds. At the same time, more than 100,000 dan of green and rough feed have been collected and stored (Binhai is a region with few people and abundant land, and allocating feed land to the teams is a practice that suits local conditions). (4) Support the basic construction of the team-run pig farms. More than 80,000 yuan of capital construction funds have been supplied to the teams throughout the county, and more than 3,000 teams have newly built more than 36,000 pigsties in the past month. Due to the above measures, the number of collectively raised pigs in the teams has risen sharply, accounting for 31% of the total number of collectively raised pigs. As of early July, 93% of the county's 3,470 teams had established pig farms. The growth rate of pigs in the county has also accelerated significantly compared to before.

In terms of private pig raising by commune members, the county party committee also adopted a policy of actively encouraging and effectively helping to solve difficulties, and promoted the implementation of the "three tickets" exchange system throughout the county. The "three tickets" are meat tickets, feed tickets, and piglet tickets. When commune members sell a fat pig to the state, the supply and marketing department issues 60 to 80 jin of feed tickets, 8 to 20 jin of meat tickets, and a piglet ticket, depending on the size of the fat pig. With the tickets, it is guaranteed to buy meat, buy feed, and buy piglets. For households with difficulties, loans are provided for support, and piglets are given to commune members to raise in advance. When commune members sell fat pigs, the principal is repaid to the team. In May of this year, the number of pigs raised by commune members increased by 92% compared to June of last year.

While "four-level farm management, focusing on teams, and every household raising pigs" were being promoted, the county also overcame five obstacles—piglets, feed, epidemic prevention, infrastructure construction, and feeding management—with the spirit of continuous revolution. This provided a material guarantee for achieving the high-speed development of pig raising. In the first half of this year, the county sold more than 40,000 fat pigs to the state and supported other regions with more than 23,000 piglets, both more than double the amount in the same period last year.

The high-speed development of pig raising in Binhai County is also due to the fact that from the county to the commune and brigade, there is a secretary in charge of pig raising, with the commune chief and team leader taking specific responsibility, forming a line of leadership from top to bottom. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the organization of pig farms at all levels was adjusted again this year, and a large number of Party members and Communist Youth League members were drawn to strengthen the feeding force. There are now more than 4,900 Party members and Communist Youth League members serving as feeders, accounting for 33% of the total number of feeders. In order to improve the management level of feeders and promote the development of pig raising, all pig farms are equipped with full-time farm managers.

　　高速度发展养猪事业的成功经验
　　滨海县四级办场户户养猪
    本报南京19日电　江苏省滨海县创造了一条高速度发展养猪事业的成功经验，这条经验就是“四级办场，五级养猪”。由于它全面地体现了中央提出的“以公养为主，私养为辅，公养与私养并举”两条腿走路的方针，根据7月上旬的统计，全县生猪圈存量已达四十八万一千多头，与去年6月份以前相比，生猪头数净增两倍多。其中集体养猪占圈存数66.1％，社员私人养猪占33.9％。按全县十五万七千多农户计算，平均每户养猪达到三点一头。
    “四级办场，五级养猪”的最大特点是各有分工、互相配合。县一级办的养猪场以繁殖良种和商品猪的育肥为主。公社办的养猪场是繁殖良种和繁殖仔猪并举；大队办的养猪场以繁殖仔猪为主，育肥为辅；小队办的养猪场，育肥为主，繁殖为辅。有了县、公社、大队、小队四级办养猪场养猪，加上每个公共食堂和每户社员私人养猪就成为五级养猪。而公共食堂与社员养猪则是专育肥猪，不养母猪。由于各级养猪分工明确，做到了大、中、小结合，就在集体养猪为主导的基础上，形成了群众性的养猪运动。
    为了加快集体养猪事业的发展，中共滨海县委除了加强县、公社、大队这三级养猪场的领导外，并特别狠抓小队集体养猪，因为小队养猪有很多有利条件：养猪规模小，资金、材料容易自筹解决；可以利用食堂的蔬菜基地和“十边”，巧种几亩地，既可解决食堂的蔬菜，又可解决猪饲料；田头建场，便于施肥。所以有人称小队办猪场是集体养猪事业中“小土群”，是当前多快好省地发展养猪事业的重要环节。县委早在去年9月份就看到了这些有利条件，并立即采取了这样四项措施：（1）全县各公社、大队专管畜牧的党委书记和支部书记有四百五十人，深入到基础较差的小队，大搞小队办场的试验田，检查工作，帮助解决问题，推动小队发养猪平衡展。（2）充分供应母猪给小队，支持小队自繁自养。（3）划分专用饲料地给小队养猪场，全县已划出四万多亩，并已种上各种高产饲料，同时，搜储了青粗饲料十多万担（滨海是人少地多地区，划分饲料地给小队，是因地制宜的做法）。（4）支持小队养猪场的基本建设，全县已供给小队基建资金八万多元，有三千多个小队在最近一个月内新建了猪圈三万六千多间。由于采取以上措施，小队集体养猪的头数直线上升，占集体养猪的总头数31％。到7月上旬为止，全县三千四百七十个小队，已有93％办了猪场。全县生猪增长的速度也比以前大大加快。
    在社员私人养猪方面，县委也是采取积极鼓励、切实帮助解决困难的办法，在全县范围内推行“三票”兑现的制度，“三票”就是肉票、饲料票、苗猪票。社员出售一头肥猪给国家，供销部门就按肥猪的大小发给六十到八十斤的饲料票；八斤到二十斤的肉票；一头苗猪票。凭票保证买到肉吃、买到饲料和苗猪。对困难户采取贷款支持、事先把仔猪给社员养，等到社员卖肥猪时，再把本钱偿还给队里。今年5月份社员养猪的头数，较去年6月份增加了92％。
    在“四级办场、狠抓小队、户户养猪”的同时，全县以不断革命的精神，闯过了仔猪、饲料、防疫、基建、饲养管理等五关。为实现高速度发展养猪事业提供了物质保证。今年上半年全县卖给国家的肥猪有四万多头，支持外地苗猪两万三千多头，都比去年同期增加一倍以上。
    滨海县生猪的高速度发展，还由于从县到公社大队，都有一名书记专管养猪工作，社长队长具体负责，形成自上而下一条线的领导。在各级党委的领导下，今年曾经再次调整各级猪场的组织，抽调大批党团员充实饲养力量，现在担任饲养员的党团员有四千九百多人，占饲养员总数的33％。为了提高饲养员管理水平，推动养猪事业的发展。所有的猪场，都配备了专职场长。
