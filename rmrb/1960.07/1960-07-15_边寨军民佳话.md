　　A Heartwarming Tale of Unity Between Border Troops and Civilians

    To help the fraternal ethnic minorities in the border areas develop agricultural production and cultural undertakings and catch up with the interior of the motherland as quickly as possible, the Yunnan Border Defense Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have selected outstanding officers and soldiers to form ethnic work teams. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, these teams are dispersed into more than two thousand villages inhabited by ethnic minorities in the border areas to assist in their work. They eat, live, and work alongside the masses, earning enthusiastic praise from the fraternal ethnic groups. The following is one of the many heartwarming tales of friendship between the army and the people that have been passed down.

    Jinzhu Village, located in the border area of Jinping County, is a large village of Kucong people who were resettled in 1958 with the help of the government. These Kucong brothers, who had lived a nomadic life in the primeval forests of the Ailao Mountains for generations, knew nothing about agricultural production except for raising pigs when they first came down the mountain. To help this fraternal ethnic group develop agricultural production, a unit of the border defense army sent three soldiers, including Deng Guoping, to this village. As soon as they arrived in Jinzhu Village, they led the Kucong people in opening up wasteland and planting crops. When the Kucong people didn't know how to plow the fields, they taught them by holding their hands; when the Kucong people didn't know how to transplant rice seedlings, they demonstrated for them. Now, the Kucong brothers have learned all the production processes from plowing, transplanting, weeding, and harvesting. Last year, they had a bumper harvest of crops, with an average of more than 700 catties of grain per person, and even had surplus grain to sell to the state. As a result of the agricultural harvest, the lives of the Kucong brothers have greatly improved. They have put on new clothes and sing the mountain song "The iron tree blooms after a thousand years, the scattered Kucong have a home, if you ask where this good life comes from, an unsetting sun rises over Jinzhu Village."

　　边寨军民佳话
    中国人民解放军驻云南边防部队，为了帮助边疆各兄弟民族发展农业生产和文化事业，迅速赶上祖国内地，抽调优秀官兵，成立了民族工作队，在党委的统一领导下，分散到边疆少数民族聚居的两千多个村寨，帮助工作。他们与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，受到兄弟民族的热烈赞扬，下面就是流传着许多表现军民友谊的佳话之一。
    金平县边沿地区的金竹寨，是1958年才在政府帮助下定居下来的一个苦聪人大寨。这些祖祖辈辈在哀牢山原始森林中过着漂泊生活的苦聪兄弟，刚下山时，除了会养猪之外，对农业生产一样也不会。为了帮助这个兄弟民族发展农业生产，边防军某部派了邓国平等三个战士来到这个寨子。他们一来到金竹寨，就带领苦聪人开起荒，种起地来。苦聪人不会犁田，他们就把着手教；苦聪人不会插秧，他们就做给他们看。到现在，从犁田、插秧、薅锄、收割等全部生产过程，苦聪兄弟都已学会了。去年，他们种的庄稼大丰收，每人平均有粮食七百多斤，还有余粮卖给国家。由于农业丰收，苦聪兄弟的生活大大改善了，他们穿上了新衣裳，唱出了“千年铁树开了花，散居的苦聪有了家，要问这好日子打哪来，金竹寨升起不落的太阳”的山歌。
