　　Growing Healthily Under the Care of the Motherland
　　Over 7,000 Returned Overseas Chinese Students Make Great Progress
　　Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The more than seven thousand returned overseas Chinese students who came back to study this year are receiving care from all aspects and are growing healthily.

    From January to May this year, a total of 7,797 overseas Chinese students returned to China to study, more than the highest annual number of overseas Chinese students received in any previous year – the entire year of 1954. Among these overseas Chinese students, more than 6,000 came from Indonesia, having been forced out of school by the persecution of influential groups in Indonesia. The rest came from Cambodia, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, India, South Vietnam, and South America.

    In order to meet the growing need for receiving returned overseas Chinese students, the government established a special reception station for overseas Chinese students at the Guangzhou port this first half of the year. The original four overseas Chinese students' preparatory schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shantou, and Jimei were expanded, and the newly built Nanning Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School opened in June. Some institutions of higher learning in Beijing and some secondary schools in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shandong, Tianjin, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other places also recruited returned overseas Chinese students in advance, admitting some of them to study in the middle of the semester.

    These returned overseas Chinese students received cordial care and a warm welcome from the moment they set foot on the motherland's ports to their entry into various schools. The reception ports, according to their actual difficulties, provided them with cotton clothes, quilts, sanitary clothing, and subsidized their travel and living expenses to school. After the returned overseas Chinese students entered school, those with economic difficulties received scholarships or loans, and those with poor academic foundations received tutoring from teachers and domestic students.

    These overseas Chinese students who have returned to the motherland have made great progress in all aspects. They obey the state's unified allocation when they study, and they can study hard after entering school. According to statistics from four middle schools in Shanghai, namely Caoyang, Kongjiang, Nanyang, and Jiguang, among the 137 returned overseas Chinese students, one-third had not studied mathematics, physics, or chemistry when they entered school, and 46 failed one of these three subjects in the exam. After three months of tutoring, they have mostly caught up, and more than half of them have excellent grades in mathematics, physics, and chemistry exams.

    Under the education of the Party, returned overseas Chinese students have gradually developed a style of loving labor and being diligent and thrifty. Among the hundreds of technical innovation experts and labor activists who have emerged from the Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, more than 80% are overseas Chinese students who returned this year.

### 在祖国各方面关怀下健康成长　七千多归侨学生进步很大

　　在祖国各方面关怀下健康成长
　　七千多归侨学生进步很大
　　新华社11日讯　今年回国学习的七千多名归国华侨学生，受到各方面的关怀，正在健康地成长。
    今年1至5月，共有七千七百九十七名华侨学生回国学习，比历年来接待华侨学生最多的一年——1954年全年的数字还要多。在这些华侨学生中，有六千多名是从印度尼西亚回来的，他们因受印度尼西亚有势力集团的迫迁而失学。其余来自柬埔寨、缅甸、马来亚、新加坡、印度、南越和南美洲等地。
    为了适应华侨学生回国人数日益增多的需要，政府今年上半年在广州口岸建立了专门的华侨学生接待站，并把原有的北京、广州、汕头、集美四所归国华侨学生中等补习学校加以扩充，新建的南宁归国华侨学生中等补习学校已经在6月间开学。北京的一部分高等院校和上海、广州、山东、天津、云南、广西等地的一些中等学校，也提前招考归国华侨学生，在学期中间接收了一部分归国华侨学生进校学习。
    这些归侨学生们一登上祖国的口岸，到进入各个学校，都受到了亲切的关怀和热情的欢迎。各接待口岸根据他们的实际困难，发给他们棉衣、棉被、卫生衣裤，并补助他们到校的旅费和生活费。归侨学生入校后，经济困难的得到了助学金或贷款，学业基础差的得到了教师和国内同学的辅导。
    这些回到祖国的华侨学生，在各方面都有很大进步。他们就学时服从国家的统一分配，就学后能刻苦学习。据上海市曹杨、控江、南洋、继光四个中学统计，一百三十七名归国华侨学生中，在入学时没有学过数学、物理、化学的占三分之一，有四十六人在这三门功课考试中有一门不及格。经过三个月的补习，现在大都已经赶上班，半数以上的人数学、物理、化学考试成绩优良。
    归侨学生们在党的教育下，也逐渐养成了热爱劳动、勤俭朴实的作风。集美华侨学生中等补习学校涌现的几百名技术革新能手和劳动积极分子中，80％以上是今年回国的华侨学生。
