Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 24th. Employees of the Guiyang City Public Transportation Company recently developed two simple automatic braking devices for automobiles, which have already been used on 65% of the company's air brake vehicles.

　　A few days ago, the company's employees conducted a driving demonstration in Guiyang City. An domestically-made Songhuajiang brand bus equipped with automatic brakes, driven by veteran driver Xiang Yecheng, sped towards a wooden bench placed in the middle of the road as an obstacle. When the front bumper of the vehicle came into contact with the wooden bench, the car automatically stopped within less than two meters. At the moment the bumper touched the bench, a safety net at the front bottom of the vehicle quickly unfurled, pushing the wooden bench forward without causing any damage. The people watching the performance on the roadside praised it endlessly, saying that in this way the safety of pedestrians is even more guaranteed.

　　The automatic braking devices for automobiles created by employees of the Guiyang City Public Transportation Company include an electric automatic brake and a lever-type automatic brake. Both devices have relatively simple structures, and the cost of each is no more than twenty yuan.

    汽车自动刹车
    贵阳制成两种简易装置
    新华社贵阳24日电  贵阳市公共汽车公司职工最近制成了两种简易汽车自动刹车装置，已经在全公司65％的汽泵刹车汽车上使用。
    前几天，公司职工在贵阳市进行了一次行车表演。一辆装着自动刹车的我国造的松花江牌客车，由老汽车司机向业成驾驶着向路中作为障碍物的木凳急驰而去。当车头保险横杆接触木凳以后，汽车在不到两米远的地方自动停止前进。在这保险横杆接触木凳的一刹那，车前底端的安全防护网迅速铺开，把木凳向前推移，使木凳没有受到任何损伤。路旁观看表演的人们赞不绝口，都说这样一来行人的安全更有保障了。
    贵阳市公共汽车公司职工创制的汽车自动刹车装置，一种是电动自动刹车；另一种是杠杆式自动刹车。两种设备构造都比较简单，每部造价不超过二十元。
