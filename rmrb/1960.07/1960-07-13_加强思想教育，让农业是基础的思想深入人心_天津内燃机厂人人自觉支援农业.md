Strengthen Ideological Education to Ingrain the Idea That Agriculture is Fundamental
　　Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant Consciously Supports Agriculture

(According to Tianjin Daily news) The Party Committee of the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant has deeply educated its workers on the idea that agriculture is fundamental, greatly enhancing the workers' awareness of supporting agriculture, which has become a huge driving force for the continuous leap forward in factory production.

Now, the factory is filled with a fighting atmosphere of supporting agriculture. The workshops are covered with slogans such as "Vigorously support agriculture in fighting drought" and "Persistently implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation"; the blackboard newspapers are full of poems written by workers praising the worker-peasant alliance; whether in large meetings or group meetings, workers speak of supporting agriculture as the bounden duty of the working class. Today, the task of supporting agriculture attracts all the workers in the factory like a magnet. Everyone rushes to do the work when a task comes, and everyone feels supremely honored to be able to contribute to agriculture. Under the guidance of the idea that agriculture is the foundation, all the workers in the factory, with one ideal and one spirit, increased the output of gas generators by nearly double in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, without increasing equipment. They also sent many workers to help rural areas train thousands of drivers for irrigation and drainage equipment, and have successively received praise from more than eighty regions.

The factory's idea of taking agriculture as the foundation was gradually established through criticism of various erroneous ideas. After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy of developing the national economy based on agriculture last year, a wave of industry supporting agriculture was also set off in the factory. However, why should agriculture be the foundation? Why should industry support agriculture? Some cadres and workers were not clear about this. For example, some individual cadres and workers believed that "gas generators are general products, and it is not exciting to work on them, so it is better to engage in cutting-edge products" and requested to change products. In response to this idea, the factory Party Committee organized all the workers to launch a debate. Through the debate, the workers gradually established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation.

In carrying out the ideological education of taking agriculture as the foundation, the factory closely combined it with the requirements of the agricultural season, using the "external" to promote the "internal," encouraging workers to develop the idea of continuous revolution, so that industry could catch up with the agricultural season. Last winter, there was very little snow. At the beginning of this year, the factory Party Committee introduced the situation of low snowfall to the workers and proposed the requirement of supporting drought resistance and starting early, calling on workers to greatly increase the production of gas generators to prepare irrigation and drainage equipment for spring plowing and sowing in rural areas. Afterwards, they explained the principle that "spring rain is as precious as oil" according to the strong seasonality of agricultural production, and educated the workers to seize the opportunity to increase the production of gas generators so that wheat could drink enough water to turn green and pass the turning green hurdle well. After April, they combined it with the requirements of long-term drought resistance and established in the minds of workers the idea of increasing the production of gas generators and supporting drought resistance for a long time. After this series of ideological education, the workers strengthened their view of serving agricultural production and put forward the slogan of action, "Rather let the machine wait for the agricultural season than let the agricultural season wait for the machine." During the tense period of drought resistance this year, the higher authorities demanded a large increase in the production of gas generators, rushed to manufacture accessories, and also sent technical workers to impart technology. The factory Party Committee repeatedly publicized the new situation of agricultural production this year and the tasks that industry should shoulder at various meetings; on the other hand, it specifically introduced the heroic deeds and soaring enthusiasm of the farmer brothers in drought resistance, which greatly inspired the workers, and set off a heat wave in the factory to rush to manufacture gas generators with the vigor of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking. With the masses mobilized, all the workers in the factory put forward thousands of innovations and suggestions, tapped a large amount of production potential, and the output plan of gas generators was overfulfilled every month.

In carrying out the education of taking agriculture as the foundation, the factory paid attention to using various and lively forms to organize the masses to conduct self-education, which has achieved good results. The main methods they adopted were "sending out" and "inviting in." "Sending out" means organizing workers to visit rural areas to understand the important role of gas generators in agricultural production, listen to the demands of farmers, and learn from the enthusiasm of farmers. During the visits, the workers were educated, and after returning to the factory, they became propagandists, using their own experiences to conduct propaganda to the workers. "Inviting in" means inviting commune members to visit the factory, hold discussions, and make reports, encouraging and promoting each other.

    加强思想教育，让农业是基础的思想深入人心
　　天津内燃机厂人人自觉支援农业
    据天津日报消息　天津内燃机厂党委会，深入向职工进行农业是基础的思想教育，极大地提高了职工群众支援农业的自觉性，成为推动工厂生产不断跃进的巨大动力。
    现在，这个工厂到处充满了支援农业的战斗气氛。车间里，贴满了“大力支援农业抗旱”、“坚持贯彻以农业为基础的方针”的标语；黑板报上，全是工人写的歌颂工农联盟的诗词；无论是开大会，还是小组会，职工们一张口就说支援农业是工人阶级责无旁贷的任务。如今，支援农业的任务像吸铁石似地吸引着全厂的职工，任务一来大家就抢着干，人人以能为农业出点力感到无尚的光荣。全厂职工就是在以农业为基础的思想指导下，一个理想、一股劲，今年上半年在不增加设备的情况下，煤气机产量比去年同期增长了近一倍。他们还派出许多工人，帮助农村培养了数以千计的排灌设备司机手，先后获得了八十多个地区的表扬。
    这个厂以农业为基础的思想，是在批判了种种错误思想中逐步树立起来的。去年党中央和毛主席提出发展国民经济要以农业为基础的方针以后，厂里也掀起了工业支援农业的热潮，但是，为什么要以农业为基础？为什么工业要支援农业？在有些干部和工人中还不清楚。例如曾有个别干部和工人认为“煤气机是一般产品，干起来不带劲，不如搞尖端产品好”，要求改换产品。工厂党委针对这种思想，组织全厂职工展开辩论。经过辩论，职工们逐步地树立起以农业为基础的思想。
    这个厂在进行以农业为基础的思想教育中，紧密地结合着农时的要求，以
  “外”促“内”，鼓舞职工发扬不断革命的思想，使工业赶在农业季节的前面。去年冬季大雪很少，这个厂党委在今年年初就把降雪少的情况向职工们做了介绍，提出支援抗旱及早动手的要求，号召工人大量增产煤气机，为农村的春耕春播准备好排灌设备。之后，他们又根据农业生产具有强烈季节性的要求，讲解“春雨贵如油”的道理，教育工人抓紧增产煤气机，叫小麦喝足返青水，过好返青关。4月以后，他们又结合长期抗旱的要求，在职工中树立增产煤气机、长期支援抗旱的思想。经过这一系列的思想教育，职工们增强了为农业生产服务的观点，提出了“宁叫机器等农时，不叫农时等机器”的行动口号。在今年抗旱紧张的时期，上级要求大量增产煤气机，赶制配件，并且还要派出技术工人传授技术。工厂党委一面在各种会议上，反复宣传今年农业生产的新形势，工业上应该担负的任务；一面具体地介绍农民弟兄在抗旱中的英雄事迹和冲天干劲，使职工群众受到了极大的鼓舞，在厂内掀起了一个用大炼钢铁劲头赶制煤气机的热潮。群众发动起来了，全厂职工提出了成千上万条革新建议，挖出了大量的生产潜力，全厂月月超额完成煤气机的产量计划。
    在进行以农业为基础的教育中，这个厂注意运用多种多样、生动活泼的形式，组织群众进行自我教育，收到了很好的效果。他们采取的主要方法是“派出去”和“请进来”。“派出去”就是组织工人到农村去访问，了解煤气机在农业生产中的重要作用，听取农民的要求，学习农民的干劲。在访问中，工人们受到了教育，回厂后成了宣传员，现身说法向工人进行宣传。“请进来”就是请社员来厂参观、座谈、做报告，互相鼓舞，互相促进。
