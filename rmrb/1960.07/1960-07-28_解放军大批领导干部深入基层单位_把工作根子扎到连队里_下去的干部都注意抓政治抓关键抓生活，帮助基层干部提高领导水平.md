Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: A high tide of going deep into companies and strengthening company work has recently been set off in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Thousands of leading cadres and office cadres have gone to companies, to the grassroots, to dispersed units, and to places where work is weak to help with work. The characteristics of this time's cadres from the leading organs of various units going deep into the companies are: responsible cadres taking the lead, greatly promoting the "five togethers" style, mainly using the method of "squatting" to cultivate "experimental fields," helping grassroots cadres improve their leadership level in an organized, planned, and purposeful way, and helping the companies solve urgent problems in a down-to-earth manner.

Up to now, the PLA troops stationed in various regions and various military services and arms, under the personal leadership and guidance of leading comrades such as General Yang Dezhi, General Su Zhenhua, and Lieutenant General Wu Faxian, have organized a large number of cadres to go to grassroots units performing various tasks to help with work. In the Beijing area troops alone, in addition to the more than 120 cadres personally led by General Yang Yong and others, more than 8,800 cadres from leadership organs above the regiment level have gone to the companies.

Under the guidance of the idea of "rooting all work in the company," after the leading cadres and office cadres at all levels went deep into the company, they paid attention to grasping political ideology, grasping key issues, and grasping the masses' lives, and helped the company quickly solve many problems. As soon as General Yang Yong arrived at the grassroots, he participated in various activities of the grassroots units and studied with the grassroots cadres how to be careful in calculations and save raw materials and materials in camp construction, instructing the grassroots cadres to go to the front line and work on the construction site. After Lieutenant General Yuan Shengping arrived at the company, he ate, lived, and operated with the soldiers, and studied with the instructor how to strengthen the company's political and ideological work. With his own experience as an instructor in the past, he explained to the instructor the importance of political workers setting an example and playing a model role. Many leading organ cadres also conducted special research on some common problems in the company's work. After Pei Zhouyu, the political commissar of a certain unit in the military region, went to the grassroots, he had heart-to-heart talks with more than 20 party committee secretaries and jointly studied how the party committee secretary can do a good job in political and ideological work. Li Tianmao, the political commissar of a certain regiment in the Nanjing Military Region, personally went to the company to serve as an instructor. In addition to specifically helping the company's cadres improve their work style and work methods, he also studied how to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses in the case of few cadres and a lot of work.

After the responsible comrades and office cadres of various units arrived at the company, they ate, lived, worked, operated, and entertained with the soldiers, bringing the PLA's traditional fine style to the grassroots units. Chen Heqiao, the political commissar of a certain unit in the Kunming Military Region, while eating and living with the soldiers in the company, often had heart-to-heart talks with the soldiers and helped the soldiers wash quilts and mend clothes. When Wang Zhengming, the commander of a certain regiment in the Beijing Military Region, was helping with work, in an exercise, he and the soldiers made the actions of blasting firepower points together, advancing, crawling, and rolling together, with fast and fierce movements.

    解放军大批领导干部深入基层单位
    把工作根子扎到连队里
    下去的干部都注意抓政治抓关键抓生活，帮助基层干部提高领导水平
    据新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军最近掀起了一个深入连队、加强连队工作的高潮。成千上万的领导干部和机关干部到连队、到基层、到分散单位和工作薄弱的地方去帮助工作。这次各部队领导机关的干部深入连队的特点是：负责干部带头，大兴“五同”之风，以“蹲”点种“试验田”的方法为主，有组织、有计划、有目的地帮助基层干部提高领导水平，踏踏实实帮助连队解决迫切需要解决的问题。
    到目前为止，解放军驻各地区部队和各军种兵种，在杨得志上将、苏振华上将、吴法宪中将等主要负责同志亲自领导和率领下，都已组织了大批干部下到执行各种不同任务的基层单位帮助工作。仅在北京地区部队，除杨勇上将等亲自率领的一百二十多名干部以外，团以上各级领导机关干部下到连队的已有八千八百多人。
    在“把一切工作的根子扎到连队去”的思想指导下，各级领导干部和机关干部深入连队以后，都注意抓政治思想，抓关键问题，抓群众生活，帮助连队迅速解决了不少问题。杨勇上将一到基层，就参加了基层单位的各种活动，和基层干部一起研究在营房修建中如何精打细算，节省原料材料，指示基层干部要亲临第一线，到工地办公。袁升平中将到连队后，就和战士同吃、同住、同操作，和指导员研究如何加强连队政治思想工作，并以自己过去当指导员的亲身经历，向指导员说明政治工作人员以身作则，起模范作用的重要意义。许多领导机关干部还就连队工作中一些带有普遍性的问题，进行了专门研究。某部队政委裴周玉少将到基层以后，和二十多位党委书记谈了心，共同研究了党委书记如何做好政治思想工作。南京地区部队某团政委李天茂，亲自下连当指导员，除了具体帮助连队干部改进工作作风和工作方法以外，还研究了在干部少工作多的情况下，如何依靠群众，发动群众的问题。
    各部队负责同志和机关干部到连队后，和战士同吃、同住、同劳动、同操作、同娱乐，把我军传统的优良作风带到基层单位。昆明地区部队某部政委陈鹤桥在连队与战士同吃、同住的同时，经常与战士促膝谈心，帮助战士洗被褥、补衣服。北京地区部队某团团长王正明在连帮助工作时，在一次演习中，和战士一起作爆破火力点的动作，一起跃进、匍匐、翻滚，动作又快又猛。
