	Barren Ravine Transformed into Ten-Thousand-Melon Ravine

	In the Jiuwuying Production Brigade of Tangtougou Commune, there is a barren ravine more than six miles long. This spring, the higher-level Party committee called for extensive utilization of idle land and the planting of more melons and vegetables. The brigade Party branch decided to develop this ravine. At that time, some people said, "This ravine doesn't even have enough land for an ox to lie down, and it has never yielded any profit, so planting it would be a waste of effort." When poor peasant commune member Zhang Cunyou heard this, he refused to accept it. He said, "If it hasn't yielded any profit in the past, this year the ravine will offer its treasure!" The Party branch supported his opinion, and six elderly commune members, led by Zhang Cunyou, came to the ravine to reclaim land. At that time, the ground was not yet thawed, and each swing of the hoe left a white mark. The seven elderly commune members, old in years but strong in spirit, worked tirelessly from dawn till dusk. In over a month, the ravine was filled with pits for planting melons. When it was time to sow, the heavens seemed to conspire against them, and there was no rain. At this time, the Party branch sent reinforcements to combat the drought and sow the seeds. In half a day, they planted 650,000 melon seedlings. In June and July, there were continuous rains, and the seven elderly commune members diligently cultivated the soil and weeded. Now, the pumpkins have already blossomed and borne fruit, and the former barren ravine has been transformed into a "Ten-Thousand-Melon Ravine." The seven elderly commune members, building on their success, have put forward a new goal: to strengthen cultivation and management, ensuring that each melon vine yields at least ten catties of melons, so that the "Ten-Thousand-Melon Ravine" will contribute 6.5 million catties of melons this year.

    荒山沟变成了万瓜沟
    汤头沟公社九屋营生产大队有一条六里多长的荒山沟。今年春天，上级党委号召广泛利用闲散土地，多种瓜菜。大队党支部决定开发这条山沟。当时，有人说：“这条沟没有卧牛之地，从来就没有得过利，种上也是白费种。”贫农社员张存有听了以后就不服气。他说：“往年没得过利，今年就要山沟献宝。”党支部支持他的意见，六个老年社员在张存有的率领下来到了山沟开荒。那时，还没有解冻，一镐一个白印，七位老社员，人老雄心在，披星戴月，从早到晚，一个多月的工夫，种瓜的坑就布满山沟。要播种了，老天爷又和他们作对，天没有雨。这时，党支部派来了支援大军，抗旱播种，半天时间种上了六十五万丛瓜。6、7月里，阴雨连绵，七位老社员又辛勤培土锄草。现在南瓜都已开花结果，过去的荒山沟，变成了“万瓜沟”。七位老社员又乘胜前进，提出了新的奋斗目标：加强培育管理，保证每棵瓜秧最少结瓜十斤，叫“万瓜沟”在今年贡献出六百五十万斤瓜来。
