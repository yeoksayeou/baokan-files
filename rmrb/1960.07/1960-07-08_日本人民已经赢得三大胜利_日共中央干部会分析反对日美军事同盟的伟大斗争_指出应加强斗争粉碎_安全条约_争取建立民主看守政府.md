Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Tokyo dispatch: The Central Committee Cadre Meeting of the Japanese Communist Party submitted a report to the Eleventh Central Committee Plenary Meeting entitled "Let Us Continue to Advance on the Basis of the Achievements Already Made in the Struggle Against the 'Security Treaty.'" The report analyzed the great struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance.

The report pointed out that the Japanese people have already won three major victories in the struggle against the "Security Treaty." The report explained that these three victories are the struggle of the Japanese people, giving the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries a heavy blow to their conspiracy to strengthen their aggressive military alliance; the cancellation of Eisenhower's trip to Japan; and although Kishi Nobusuke originally intended to remain in power for a long time, he had to announce his intention to resign.

The report pointed out that the reason for the Japanese people's aforementioned victories is the unity of the people of all strata with the working class as the core. The report also pointed out the role played by the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," which included the participation of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, at the central and local levels. The report said that although the above-mentioned joint struggle organizations are not yet the national democratic united front advocated by the Communist Party, they have formed a kind of united front with clear political goals. These organizations should be maintained and developed.

The JCP Central Committee pointed out in the report that in order for the new "Security Treaty" to be invalidated and abolished, the current struggle goals of the Japanese people are: to prevent the establishment of a Kishi Nobusuke-style government, the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the declaration by a democratic caretaker government of the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections.

The report emphasized that "after the general election, a democratic coalition government should be established, whose main task is to invalidate the security treaty."

The JCP Central Committee also put forward the demands that should be included in the common program of the democratic forces. These demands are: the withdrawal of U-2 jet aircraft from Japan, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan, the cancellation of U.S. bases in Japan, the prohibition of Japanese nuclear armament, the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, strict adherence to the constitutional provisions, and the dissolution of the "Self-Defense Forces."

The report emphasized that the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance should be strengthened. The report pointed out that the slogan of striving to establish a democratic caretaker government is timely and correct.

The report also requested the Socialist Party to firmly adhere to the principle of uniting and struggling with all democratic forces.

The report also pointed out: In order for the correct unity of all democratic forces, an uncompromising struggle should be waged against all destructive and provocative actions directly and indirectly brought into the people's movement by the Trotskyites.

The report requested party organizations at all levels to concentrate their efforts on preparing for the general election, and emphasized that the election campaign must be launched in an atmosphere of surging mass movements and on the basis of developing unified action and a unified front. The report said that the Communist Party will conduct struggles in the election campaign, emphasizing joint action with the Socialist Party.

The report concluded by explaining the issue of party building. The report said that the party is more united than ever in the historically significant struggle, and its leading position among democratic forces has been greatly strengthened. The circulation of the Party Central Committee's newspaper "Akahata" increased by 6,000 copies in the first half of this year, and the circulation of the "Akahata" Sunday edition and the "Zenei" monthly magazine increased by 15,000 and 2,600 copies, respectively.

The report pointed out that the new situation has opened up possibilities for the further development of the party. The party has learned the following lessons from the experience of the great struggle: it is necessary to strengthen the organization of existing workers, organize peasant associations in the countryside, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance in order to win the final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th dispatch: According to TASS, New York, June 6th dispatch: The "Christian Science Monitor" published a letter from students of the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Tokyo. This letter showed the solemn position of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

The Japanese students' letter pointed out that the movement against the U.S.-Japan military treaty currently unfolding throughout Japan demonstrates the Japanese people's concern for domestic and international politics that are related to their daily lives. It said: "Those participating in the anti-(U.S.-Japan) treaty movement include workers, students, professors, actors, writers, housewives, and shop owners." The letter writers pointed out that the Japanese ruling clique trampled on the spirit of the Japanese Constitution regarding not resorting to war and brought the disaster of militarism to the Japanese people.

The Japanese students' letter said that the Japanese people have taken measures such as mass demonstrations, signature campaigns, and petitions to the Diet to oppose the U.S.-Japan military treaty. The majority of the Japanese people are greatly dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government's "passage" of this treaty, and they believe that a general election must be held.

The letter said: "We are concerned that this revised treaty will cause unnecessary tensions in the Far East… because this treaty is clearly a strongly military treaty."

It emphasized: "We firmly believe that in order to contribute to maintaining world peace, it is urgently necessary to establish peaceful and friendly relations with our neighbors, including China and the Soviet Union. And in the current international situation, we believe that our current policy will bring disaster to us."

The letter concluded by condemning Japanese militarism for depriving the Japanese people of their basic rights and emphasized: "We cannot convince ourselves that the revised U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will guarantee the maintenance of peace and democracy in Japan."

    日本人民已经赢得三大胜利
    日共中央干部会分析反对日美军事同盟的伟大斗争
    指出应加强斗争粉碎“安全条约”争取建立民主看守政府
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会向第十一次中央委员会全体会议提出题为
  “让我们在反对‘安全条约’斗争已经取得的成就的基础上继续前进”的报告。报告对日本人民反对日美军事同盟的伟大斗争作了分析。
    报告指出，日本人民在反对“安全条约”的斗争中已经赢得了三大胜利。报告说明这三个胜利是日本人民的斗争，给予美帝国主义者和日本反动派加强侵略性军事同盟的阴谋以沉重的打击；取消了艾森豪威尔的日本之行；尽管岸信介原来打算长期当权，但他不得不宣布要辞职。
    报告指出，日本人民取得上述胜利的原因是以工人阶级为核心的各阶层人民的团结。报告并且指出了共产党、社会党和日本工会总评议会参加的中央和地方阻止修改
  “安全条约”国民会议所起的作用。报告说，虽然上述共同斗争组织还不是共产党所提倡的全国民主统一战线，但是它们形成了某种具有鲜明的政治目标的统一战线。这些组织应该保持下去并加以发展。
    日共中央在报告中指出，日本人民为了使得新“安全条约”归于无效和废除这个条约，当前的斗争目标是：阻止建立岸信介式的政府，岸信介内阁立即辞职，由民主的看守政府宣布解散国会和举行大选。
    报告强调指出，“大选以后，应当建立一个民主联合政府，它的主要任务是使安全条约归于无效。”
    日共中央还在报告中提出了应当包括在民主力量的共同纲领中的要求。这些要求是：把U—2型喷气机撤出日本、美国军队撤出日本、取消在日本的美国基地、禁止日本核武装、同中国恢复外交关系、同苏联缔结和约、严格遵守宪法条款、解散“自卫队”。
    报告强调指出，应该加强粉碎美日军事同盟的斗争。报告指出，争取建立民主看守政府的口号是及时的，正确的。
    报告还要求社会党坚定地遵循同一切民主力量联合斗争的原则。
    报告并且指出：为了一切民主力量的正确的团结，应当同托派直接和间接带入人民运动中来的一切破坏和挑衅行动进行毫不妥协的斗争。
    报告要求各级党组织集中力量来准备大选，并且强调说，必须在高涨的群众运动的气氛中和在发展统一行动和统一阵线的基础上展开竞选运动。报告说，共产党将在竞选运动中进行斗争，重视同社会党采取联合行动。
    报告在最后说明了关于党的建设的问题。报告说，党在有历史意义的斗争中比以往任何时候更加团结了，它在民主力量中的领导地位大大加强了。党中央机关报“赤旗报”的发行量今年上半年增加了六千份，“赤旗报”星期日版和“前卫”月刊的发行量分别增加了一万五千份和二千六百份。
    报告指出，新的形势为党的进一步发展开辟了可能性。党通过伟大的斗争的经验吸取了如下的教训：必须加强现有工人的组织化程度，在乡村组织农民协会并加强工农联盟，以争取最后的胜利。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：“基督教科学箴言报”发表了东京大学英美问题研究系学生的来信，这封信表明了日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争的严正立场。
    日本学生的信指出，目前在日本全国展开的反对美日军事条约的运动，说明了日本人民对关系到他们的日常生活的国内和国际政治的关心。它说：“参加反对（美日军事）条约运动的，有工人、学生、教授、演员、作家、家庭妇女和店主”。写信的人指出，日本统治集团践踏日本宪法关于不采取战争手段的精神，而把军国主义的灾难带给日本人民。
    日本学生们的信说，日本人民采取了群众示威、签名运动以及向国会请愿等方式反对日美军事条约。大多数日本人民对岸信介政府
  “通过”这个条约大为不满，他们认为必须举行大选。
    这封信说：“我们担心，这个修改后的条约将在远东引起不必要的紧张局势……因为这个条约显然是一个强烈的军事性条约。”
    它强调说：“我们坚信，为了对维护世界和平作出贡献，同包括中国和苏联在内的我们的邻国建立和平和友好关系是迫切需要的。而在当前的国际形势下，我们认为，我们的现行政策将给我们带来灾难。”
    这封信最后谴责日本军国主义剥夺了日本人民的基本权利，并且着重指出：“我们无法使自己相信修改后的美日安全条约将保证在日本保持和平和民主。”
