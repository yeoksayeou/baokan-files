Before returning to their units, the responsible comrades of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee met with the representatives. The Municipal Party Committee responsible comrades called on the representatives and the city's cultural and educational workers to conscientiously implement the central instructions and the spirit of the conference, learn from the national advanced experience, always hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and be promoters in the cultural revolution. Many units held "Welcoming the Red Flag" conferences, warmly welcoming the representatives back and listening to them convey the grand occasion and spirit of the conference. Some units also invited representatives from all over the country to give reports, launching the study of the central leading comrades' reports at the conference and related documents.

After the representatives of advanced units such as Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural University, and Beijing Medical College returned, the Party committees held meetings to listen to the representatives' reports and discuss the implementation of the conference's spirit. Gao Yi, the representative of Tsinghua University and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, gave a report to more than 16,000 teachers, students, and staff, which was received with great enthusiasm. Zhang Zigao, an advanced worker and 70-year-old professor, actively engaged in the teaching revolution as soon as he returned from the Heroes Conference. He not only participated in the leading core of the Education Revolution in the Chemistry Department of the school and worked hard to study Chairman Mao's works, but also enthusiastically helped young teachers and students to check literature and find materials for academic criticism. The teachers and students said: After attending the Heroes Conference, teacher Zhang Zigao has more enthusiasm and is stricter with himself. After the representatives of Beijing Normal University returned, the school organized a special team to continue to carry out in-depth and meticulous pilot projects on the education revolution in primary and secondary schools, and at the same time, taking advantage of the victory, deeply carried out the teaching reform of various departments in the school. Now, all the universities are taking advantage of the east wind of the Heroes Conference to launch a new upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously carry out the education revolution.

After the representatives of middle and primary schools, spare-time education, and childcare in the city returned, they also promoted the development of work in these areas. After Zhang Xianhua, the representative of the advanced unit Shijia Hutong Primary School in Beijing and Secretary of the Party Branch, returned, he led the teachers to actively study the advanced experience of teaching reform in Beiguan Primary School in Heishan County, revise the original teaching reform plan, and make the teaching reform work faster and better.

Now, most of the teachers in mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and geography in the school are working on creating and innovating teaching equipment. Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, an advanced unit that has persisted in running spare-time education for ten years, opened a new workshop director experimental class after the Heroes Conference in order to accelerate the training of technical talents from workers. Ma Qingfeng, a loading and unloading worker who has changed from a semi-literate to a part-time teacher in a spare-time school, was specially invited to attend the Heroes Conference. He is determined to learn from Song Shihe, a disabled soldier and spare-time school teacher with "a red heart that never fades," and contribute his greatest strength to the cultural emancipation of his class brothers. He conveyed to the loading and unloading workers the vivid examples of the growth of a large number of working-class intellectuals who attended the conference, which greatly encouraged the workers, and their attendance rate in spare-time schools quickly rose from 70% to more than 95%. Zhang Fenglan, the director of the nursery of the Dahongmen Brigade of the Nanyuan Commune, further realized that cultivating communist successors is a very glorious cause after hearing the introduction of the advanced ideas and advanced experiences of the nursery sisters from all over the country, and she loved her work even more. During the conference, she made several phone calls back to the nursery to tell the nannies the "experience" she had gained. Now the nursery has a new look, and they use old wood to make three large prams, pushing the children out for sunbathing every morning and afternoon to let the communist successors grow up healthily.

After hearing the representatives convey the spirit of the Heroes Conference, new atmospheres also appeared in the fields of culture, health, sports, and news.

Xie Tian, the representative of the "Sixty-One Class Brothers" production team of the Beijing Film Studio, went to the Erlong Road People's Commune to shoot a feature film reflecting the rapid development of street factories on the evening of his return from the Heroes Conference, and created a record of shooting 111 shots in one day. The representatives of the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College gave academic reports on the rapid comprehensive treatment of "neurasthenia," "arthritis," and "peptic ulcer" to various medical units in the city.

According to the spirit of the conference, the teachers and students of the advanced unit Jilin University revised the teaching reform plan for this semester and re-arranged the teaching reform work. In order to realize the great call of intellectuals' laborization, the vast number of teachers and students actively participate in various physical labor while vigorously carrying out teaching reform, striving for a bumper harvest in labor, ideology, health, and study. The 1,300 students of this school who are working in the Xinlicheng Reservoir have set off an upsurge of labor competition under the encouragement and promotion of the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, which has not only overfulfilled the production tasks but also tempered their ideology. The vast number of teachers and students of Jilin Normal University use their spare time to go deep into factories, rural areas, and urban people's communes to help establish various spare-time cultural schools and technical schools, train teachers, and also serve as part-time teachers.

Through studying the relevant documents of the conference, all the staff of the advanced unit Changchun Film Studio have seen the current situation of China's cultural revolution and further realized the task of film in the cultural revolution. The films "The Furnace Fire is Red", which is currently being produced and will be put into production soon, which expresses the great leap forward in steel production, and "Embroidery of the Rivers and Mountains", which expresses the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants; and "Young People in Our Village" (sequel), which reflects the life of young commune members in people's communes, are all works praising the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. According to the spirit of the conference, they also regard the struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism as an important content of film production this year. The films that are being actively prepared to be filmed on this subject include: "The 38th Parallel", which reflects the great victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea; "The Battle of Yan'an", which reflects the unity of the army and the people during the Liberation War, opposing counter-revolutionary wars with revolutionary wars, and achieving victory; "The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895", which reflects the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle in the Sino-Japanese War. Now, under the leadership of the factory Party committee, all the staff of the factory are actively completing the task of producing 26 films throughout the year.

After returning to the school, Mao Qinglai, the representative of the advanced unit Jilin Opera School and Vice Principal, devoted himself to the intense teaching work and demonstrated various martial arts movements for the students.

The "Butterfly" and "Baishuitan" and other programs performed by these young actors are deeply praised by the audience.

The representatives of health, sports, and news units are actively implementing the spirit and resolutions of the conference, and are determined to push the cultural revolution to a new climax.

Under the unified organization and arrangement of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city has deeply carried out the work of delivering reports, and has successively held a delivery conference attended by more than 4,000 people, and has also delivered reports at various levels according to the system and industry, and has held many symposiums, small report meetings, and discussion meetings. The representatives also went to relatively remote districts, counties, factories, and schools to deliver reports. At present, more than 50 delivery meetings have been held in the city, and most units have conducted discussions and symposiums.

Taking advantage of the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, many units are deeply carrying out the movement to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. Chongqing University, an advanced collective that once sent representatives to attend the conference, has more than 10,000 teachers and students who, after deeply discussing the delivered report, have posted big-character posters to the Party Committee to express their desire to always maintain their glory and make leaps and bounds. Some teachers and students of the Department of Mechanics and the Department of Metallurgy of this school have revised their leap-forward plans and proposed to carry out teaching reform more deeply and thoroughly. The city's health units have uniformly organized working groups to conduct a major inspection of the work of hospitals throughout the city, exchanging experiences and improving work while inspecting, effectively implementing the spirit of the conference.

Many advanced collectives and advanced worker representatives who once attended the conference have also formulated plans for continued leap forward while conveying the spirit of the conference to the city.
