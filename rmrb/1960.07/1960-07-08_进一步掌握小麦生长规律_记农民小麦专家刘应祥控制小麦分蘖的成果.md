Further Mastering Wheat Growth Patterns
    ——Recording Farmer Wheat Expert Liu Yingxiang's Achievements in Controlling Wheat Tillering
    By our reporter Zhang Lizhong

    As soon as we arrived in Yanshi County, Henan Province, a wheat red banner county, we heard that Liu Yingxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Zhai Zhen Commune Party Committee and a famous wheat expert, had cultivated an extraordinary wheat crop. In the past, Liu Yingxiang had achieved great success in cultivating excellent wheat varieties and preventing wheat lodging. This year, he boldly experimented and successfully controlled ineffective wheat tillering and enhanced effective tillering. According to agricultural scientists, controlling ineffective wheat tillering is a new initiative. This matter aroused everyone's interest, and we also wanted to see what it was all about.

    Peeking into the Secrets of High Wheat Yields
    The hundred acres of wheat cultivated by Liu Yingxiang this year have tall and strong stalks. Each ear of wheat has an average of thirty to forty grains, and there are very few secondary or tertiary spikelets. We have seen many good wheat crops elsewhere, but secondary and tertiary spikelets always account for 30% to 40%. The main reason is that each wheat plant in Liu Yingxiang's field has two or three tillers. Liu Yingxiang introduced: "In the past, some wheat plants had five or six tillers, but most of these tillers died halfway, or grew small ears. Now we fundamentally control the number of tillers, so that each tiller can grow as large an ear as possible." The result of this year's harvest of wheat cultivated by Liu Yingxiang was that one mu yielded 1009 jin, and another mu yielded more than 800 jin.

    In recent years, Liu Yingxiang has carefully selected and cultivated more than 200 wheat varieties and made new contributions in deep plowing, close planting, and lodging prevention. From a yield of 160 jin per mu in 1952 to 518 jin per mu in 1958. In 1958, some high-yield plots appeared across the country, impacting Liu Yingxiang's thinking. He wanted to achieve an even higher yield. Therefore, in his high-yield field, he sowed 40 jin of seeds per mu, applied 10,000 jin of base fertilizer, 20 jin of ammonium sulfate, and another 20 jin of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate before the ground froze. Sure enough, after the wheat emerged, it tillered exceptionally. By the time the ground froze, there were more than 2.6 million plants per mu. After the New Year, when the wheat turned green again, it tillered once more, reaching more than 3 million plants per mu. He calculated at the time that if all these plants grew ears, each mu could produce 7,000 to 8,000 jin of wheat. Unexpectedly, after jointing, only about 400,000 tillers could produce ears, and the remaining more than 2 million died.

    Increasing Effective Tillers and Controlling Ineffective Tillers
    Although this matter did not achieve the intended purpose, it gave him a good inspiration. He thought: Can we control ineffective tillering to a minimum and enhance effective tillering? He began to study this issue. He pondered day and night, looking for evidence and researching history. Suddenly, he remembered the two and a half mu vegetable plot behind the village. This plot had previously yielded 7,000 jin of radishes. Although 10,000 jin of base fertilizer had been applied, the base was still weak. At that time, 25 jin of seeds were sown per mu. Because the land was infertile and there were few seeds, only 800,000 plants per mu tillered before the ground froze. Initially, they were third-class seedlings. During the management period, they added fertilizer and water, leaving more than 500,000 seedlings. In the end, each mu yielded more than 680 jin. In the high-yield method, 10,000 jin of base fertilizer, 80 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 40 jin of superphosphate were applied, and 40 jin of seeds were sown. In the end, more than 400,000 seedlings remained. Due to lodging in the middle stage and the density of the seedlings with small ears, ineffective tillering wasted soil fertility. Each ear averaged 19 grains, and each mu only yielded 630 jin. After repeated verification with practical materials, fewer ineffective tillers saved fertilizer and increased yield.

    How to control ineffective tillers and enhance effective tillers? Initially, Liu Yingxiang did not have a complete set of methods. He first consulted wheat cultivation science. From wheat cultivation science, he learned that wheat tillering is most vigorous before winter and has a relatively high efficiency. Wheat also tillers before turning green in the spring, but most of it is ineffective. After finding the pattern of tillering, he concentrated his efforts on studying the control of pre-winter tillering. He recalled, why did the wheat tiller so much in 1959? The first characteristic of that year was that 40 jin of seeds were sown per mu. Naturally, more seeds meant more tillers. He checked the sowing amount records in the experimental field: sowing 20 jin per mu yielded 651 jin per mu; sowing 30 jin per mu yielded 773 jin per mu; sowing 40 jin per mu yielded 761 jin per mu. The results showed that a sowing amount of 30 jin per mu was appropriate. He changed the sowing amount from 40 jin to 25 to 30 jin per mu. After solving the sowing amount problem, he considered the fertilization issue. Last year, in addition to applying 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, he also applied 20 jin of ammonium sulfate with the seeds, and another 20 jin of ammonium sulfate before the wheat turned green. These nitrogen fertilizers directly promoted the growth of seedlings and caused excessive tillering, which was not beneficial for increasing grain production. This year, chemical fertilizers could not be applied in the early stage. In terms of sowing period, sowing too early meant a longer growing season in autumn, and tillering would inevitably be excessive, and the seedlings would be vigorous before winter. When was the right time to sow? He went deep into the masses to find experienced farmers for research. The old farmers said: "Sow 'frost-bitten wheat'," which means sowing five or six days before the frost falls. By the time the wheat emerges, it will be frosty. Liu Yingxiang thought: Frost is a control over wheat growth. There are 40 days between frost and freezing. During this period, because the weather is cold, wheat grows slowly. By the time the ground freezes, the wheat will have just two or three tillers. After the ground freezes, the wheat will no longer tiller. He sowed and fertilized in this way. Sure enough, each wheat plant only tillered two or three times by the time the ground froze, achieving the expected result.

    Making Every Effective Tiller Strong
    How to make these tillers strong and grow neatly, producing large ears? Last year, he investigated the old society's temple fair in the first month. The wheat around the temple fair, after being trampled by people, grew particularly strong and resistant to lodging. This shows that trampling can have a suppressing effect. This year, he also used the method of suppression to solve the problem of the main stem being strong and the tillers being weak. He rolled the field several times with a large stone roller. The main stem suffered setbacks, and the tillers caught up with the main stem.

    After Liu Yingxiang's research and control measures, the highest tillering of wheat this year reached 1.18 million plants per mu, with about 500,000 effective tillers, and the highest reaching 620,000.

    After the wheat turned green, it was about to joint. Liu Yingxiang studied every day how to make each effective tiller grow large ears. He walked to the vegetable plot of the fourth team and met old man Liu Bao. Because the vegetable plot had previously harvested a season of vegetables, the land was thin, and the wheat leaves stood straight up. Liu Bao said to Liu Yingxiang: This wheat has pricked up its ears and turned onion green. If you don't fertilize it again, some wheat will not be able to grow ears. This is a characteristic of lean wheat. Liu Yingxiang then went to the experimental field. Here, the wheat was heavily fertilized. The wheat leaves were wide and thick, and the wheat leaves were dark green. Because the wheat leaves were wide and thick, they not only could not stand up straight, but also drooped down from between the leaf stems, like pig ears; this kind of pig ear wheat showed signs of lodging even before jointing. Liu Yingxiang then went to the high-yield area and saw that the wheat was bluish-green. The wheat leaves were neither fat nor thin. The tips of the wheat leaves drooped down slightly. Liu Yingxiang proposed the three situations he saw and studied them with Mei Nan, a teacher from Beijing Agricultural University who was conducting agricultural research in Yuetan. Mei Nan said: "You are really something. Chen Yongkang, a national expert in paddy soil, proposed three colors of rice, and you proposed three types of wheat. This is worth studying." He took specimens of the three types of wheat mentioned by Liu Yingxiang for testing, and the chlorophyll completely conformed to scientific principles. After Mei Nan affirmed Liu Yingxiang's view, it further promoted Liu Yingxiang's determination to study. He called the fat wheat with drooping leaves and dark green color pig ears; the lean wheat with straight leaves and onion green color horse ears; and the wheat that was neither fat nor thin, with slightly drooping leaf tips and bluish-green color donkey ears.

    Classified Fertilization to Promote Uniform Wheat Growth
    After discovering the different performances of the three types of wheat, Liu Yingxiang continued to study the causes. He squatted down to inspect the roots of the pig ear wheat (fat wheat) and found that the first leaf was black, the second leaf was white, and the wheat stalk was also white, with a thin and soft skin, like white bean sprouts, which posed a danger of lodging. He then went to the donkey ear wheat field to check, and the leaf color was normal, and the wheat stalk was thick and strong. The first leaf of the horse ear wheat was dry at the tip, and the second leaf was onion green, showing serious nitrogen fertilizer deficiency. Liu Yingxiang adopted different methods for the different situations of these three types of wheat. Pig ear wheat (fat wheat) already showed signs of lodging and could no longer be fertilized with nitrogen fertilizer. Only 200 jin of plant ash and 20 to 30 jin of phosphorus fertilizer were applied to strengthen the stalks. After fertilization, it was not watered in time. For horse ears (lean wheat), 15 jin of ammonium sulfate and 30 dan of human manure were applied. These were all quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers. After watering, it turned into donkey ear wheat (normal wheat) in seven days. For the donkey ears, measures were taken to both control lodging and promote growth. 500 jin of plant ash, 50 jin of superphosphate, and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied per mu to make it grow normally. That is, to control the overgrowth that may cause lodging, and to promote the growth of the weak.

    After a year of experiments, the patterns of close planting, fertilization, and watering were basically found, and the appropriate number of wheat plants per mu was also basically determined. Liu Yingxiang is now considering how to make the ears large and the grains full after a certain number of plants. There is a lot of potential here. He is now working on cultivating some good varieties. "Nanda 2419" can increase production by more than 20% compared to "Bima No. 1" under the same conditions. Strengthening late-stage management has a great influence on increasing the weight of the grains. Spraying phosphorus and watering for grain filling have a great effect on wheat grain fullness.

    进一步掌握小麦生长规律
    ——记农民小麦专家刘应祥控制小麦分蘖的成果
    本报记者　张励中
    我们一到河南省的小麦红旗县——偃师县，就听说翟镇公社党委副书记、著名的小麦专家刘应祥培养了一块与众不同的小麦。刘应祥过去在培育小麦优良品种、防止小麦倒伏等方面很有成绩。今年，他又大胆的试验成功了控制小麦无效分蘖增强有效分蘖。据农业科学家们谈，控制小麦无效分蘖是个新的创举，这件事引起每个人的兴趣，我们也想看个究竟。
    窥探小麦高产的秘密
    刘应祥今年培育的百亩小麦，麦秆高大、粗壮，每个麦穗平均有三、四十个籽粒，很少有二、三棚小穗，我们在别的地方看过很多好麦，二、三棚穗，总是占30％至40％。主要原因是，刘应祥的麦田每颗麦子有两三个分蘖，刘应祥介绍说：“过去，有的一颗麦子分五、六个蘖，但这些分蘖半路上要死去大部分，或者长出小穗，现在我们从根本上就控制少分蘖，叫它每个分蘖尽可能长出大穗。”刘应祥培育的小麦，今年收打的结果，有一亩打了一千零九斤，有一亩打了八百多斤。
    几年来，刘应祥精选和培育了二百多个小麦品种，在深耕、密植、防倒伏等方面，都有新的贡献，从1952年的亩产一百六十斤到1958年亩产提高到五百一十八斤。1958年，全国各地出现了一些高额丰产片，冲击着刘应祥的思想，他想搞个更高额的丰产。于是，他的丰产田，亩播种子四十斤，底肥一万斤，硫酸铵二十斤，封冻前，又施了二十斤化肥硫酸铵。果然，小麦出土后，分蘖特别多，到封冻前，就每亩达到二百六十多万株，过了年，小麦返青，又经过一次分蘖，每亩小麦达到三百多万株。他当时计算了一下，如果这些株都长出穗来，每亩可产七、八千斤小麦。不料，到拔节后，能抽出穗的分蘖，只剩了四十来万株，其余的二百多万株死掉了。
    增加有效分蘖，控制无效分蘖
    这件事，虽然没有达到预想的目的，但给了他一个很好的启示。他想：能不能控制无效分蘖到最低限度，增强有效分蘖？他开始研究这个问题。他日夜苦思，找根据，查历史。猛然他想起村后的二亩半菜地，这块地前茬收了七千斤萝卜，虽然上了一万斤底肥，可是底子薄了，当时，亩播二十五斤种子，因为地力薄种子少，到封冻前，每亩只分蘖八十万株，开始是三类苗，他们在管理期中，加肥加水，剩下五十多万株苗，最后，每亩收了六百八十多斤。而丰产方的底肥一万斤，上了八十斤硫酸铵，四十斤过磷酸钙，播种四十斤种子，最后剩了四十多万株苗，由于中期倒伏和苗子密小穗多，无效分蘖浪费了地力，每穗平均十九粒籽，每亩只收了六百三十斤。经过实际材料反复证明，无效分蘖少了，节约肥料，产量增高。
    怎样控制无效分蘖，增强有效分蘖？开始，刘应祥并没有成套的办法。他首先求教于小麦栽培学，他从小麦栽培学中看到，小麦分蘖冬前是最旺盛时期，而且是有效率比较高，春季返青前，小麦也要分蘖，多半是无效。他找出分蘖的规律后，集中力量又研究控制冬前分蘖。他回忆，为什么1959年的小麦分蘖特别多？这一年的第一个特点，就是每亩播种四十斤种子。籽多当然分蘖多。他查试验场的播种量记载：每亩播种二十斤的，亩产六百五十一斤；亩播三十斤的，亩产七百七十三斤；亩播四十斤的，亩产七百六十一斤。查看结果还是播量三十斤为适当。他就改亩播四十斤为二十五至三十斤。播种量解决了以后，他又考虑施肥问题。去年，一亩地除了施底肥一万斤外，还随种子施二十斤硫酸铵，返青前又施了二十斤硫酸铵。这些氮肥，都是直接促幼苗发旺的速效肥料，促使分蘖过多，对增粮增籽没有什么好处，今年可以在前期不施化肥。从播种期上，播的过早，秋季生长时间长，分蘖必然过多，苗子冬前旺，什么时候播种才正合适？他又深入到群众找老农研究，老农们说：“要种霜打麦”，也就是说：霜降前五、六天下种，等到小麦出土，正好下霜。刘应祥想：下霜对小麦生长是个控制，霜降到封冻有四十天，这期间因为天气冷，小麦生长慢，到封冻小麦正好分二、三个蘖，封冻后小麦就不分蘖了。他就这样播种和施肥，果然，每颗小麦到封冻后只分了二、三个蘖，达到了预想的结果。
    叫有效分蘖个个壮实
    怎样叫这些分蘖都壮实，都能生长整齐结出大穗？他去年考察了旧社会正月赶庙会，庙会周围的麦子经过人们脚踏，长的特别壮实，能抗倒伏。这说明人踏能起镇压作用，今年他还用镇压这一办法，解决主茎壮、分蘖弱的问题。他用大石磙轧了几遍，主茎受了挫折，分蘖也赶上主茎。
    经过刘应祥的研究并采取措施控制，今年大面积小麦分蘖最高每亩达一百一十八万株，有效分蘖五十万株左右，最高达六十二万株。
    小麦返青后，快要拔节了，刘应祥每天研究怎样才能使每个有效分蘖长出大穗。他走到四队菜地，碰到刘宝老汉。菜地的麦子因为前茬收了一季菜，地薄，小麦叶子直直竖着，刘宝对刘应祥说：这小麦已竖起耳朵呈葱绿色，再不上肥就要有一些麦长不出穗。这是瘦麦的特征。刘应祥又走到试验场，这里麦子上肥多，麦叶宽，叶子厚，麦叶是黑绿色，因为麦叶又宽又厚，不但竖不起来，而且从叶茎间就往下搭落，好像个猪耳朵；这种猪耳朵麦子，虽然没拔节，就有了倒伏的象征。刘应祥又到丰产方，看到小麦是青绿色，麦叶既不肥又不瘦，麦叶尖部稍往下搭落。刘应祥把他看到的三种情况，提出来和正在岳滩进行农业研究的北京农业大学教师梅南同志研究。梅南说：“你真不简单，全国水稻土专家陈永康提出水稻三种颜色，你提出小麦三种类型，这值得研究。”他把刘应祥说的三种麦子，弄了标本化验，叶绿素完全合乎科学道理。梅南肯定了刘应祥的看法后，更促进了刘应祥的研究决心。他把麦叶搭落、黑绿色的肥麦叫猪耳朵；麦叶直竖、葱绿色的瘦麦叫马耳朵；麦子不肥不瘦，叶尖稍搭落、青绿色的叫驴耳朵。
    分类施肥促使小麦生长一致
    刘应祥发现三种麦子的不同表现后，继续研究原因。他到猪耳朵麦（肥麦）地蹲下来检查小麦根部，发现第一个叶发黑，第二个叶发白，麦秆也是白色的，皮很薄发软，像白豆芽，这有倒伏的危险。又到驴耳朵麦地查看，叶色正常，麦秆粗壮。马耳朵麦第一个叶子干尖，第二个叶发葱，表现了严重的缺氮肥现象。刘应祥对这三种麦子的不同情况，采用了不同对待的方法。猪耳朵麦（肥麦）已有倒伏象征，不能再上氮肥，只上了二百斤草木灰和二、三十斤磷化肥壮秆。上完肥后并没及时浇水。对马耳朵（瘦麦），上了十五斤硫酸铵和三十担人粪尿，这些都是速效氮肥，上完浇了一水，七天变成了驴耳朵麦（正常麦）。对驴耳朵的措施，既控制倒伏又促进生长，每亩施了五百斤草木灰和五十斤过磷酸钙，十斤硫酸铵，使它正常生长。这就是，对过旺而有倒伏可能的进行控制，对瘦弱的促进生长。
    经过一年的试验，基本上找到了密植、施肥、浇水的规律，也基本摸到了每亩地小麦株数适当的数字。刘应祥现在正考虑有了一定的株数以后，怎样使穗大籽饱，这里潜力比较大。他现在正着手培育一些好品种像“南大二四一九”就比“碧蚂一号”在同样条件下可增产20％以上。如何加强后期管理，对增加籽粒的重量有很大关系，像喷磷、浇攻籽水都对小麦籽饱有很大作用。
