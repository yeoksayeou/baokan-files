Shandong Seizes the Opportunity to Collect and Plant Fodder Extensively.
Sichuan Wusheng County Satellite Brigade Establishes Fodder Base to Ensure Annual Increase in Pigs.

(Our Dispatch from Jinan, July 30) Shandong is seizing favorable opportunities to intensively plant and collect fodder, providing a reliable material foundation for the great development of livestock. More than 400,000 livestock farms and a million-strong feeding force in the province are the backbone of large-scale fodder planting and collection. According to statistics, various localities have planted 1.7 million mu of fodder, and are now making full use of vacant land to plant another 700,000 mu of fodder. The planting area of fodder land is constantly expanding.

Shandong Province has a very good animal husbandry development situation this year. The Provincial Party Committee requires a further major development by the end of the year based on the current foundation. In order to meet the needs of animal husbandry development, various localities are resolutely grasping the large-scale production of feed and forage, striving to ensure that the preparation of feed and forage precedes the great development of livestock production. At present, the province's specialized feeding teams are combining with the mass weeding and wasteland reclamation movement to launch a concentrated rush to plant feed and forage. Linyi Prefecture mobilized 430,000 people who, while collecting feed and forage, have planted more than 377,000 mu of feed. In Yantai Prefecture, Zhaoyuan, Penglai, Wendeng, Haiyang and other counties planted more than 18,000 mu of feed land in mid-July. Shouzhang County's Shimen Song Commune, according to the pig development plan for autumn, planted 500 mu of feed land, and fixed a professional team to specialize in the management of feed planting and storage. At present, the commune's 20 mu of kohlrabi planted in the spring is about to be harvested and used to feed pigs. In order to plant and manage the feed land well, and strive for high yields and more harvests, the feeding grounds of various counties, communes, and teams have fixed professional teams to manage it, developing towards self-reliance. Pig farms in Ningyang, Shouzhang, Tancheng, Qihe and other counties, due to good feed planting management, have begun to harvest early-maturing melons and vegetables one after another. Some pig farms in counties and communes such as Ningyang and Shouzhang have basically achieved self-sufficiency in feed due to adopting the policy of self-reliance.

While planting and collecting feed and forage on a large scale, various localities are also actively mobilizing the masses to carry out chlorella production. Many regions have produced large quantities of concentrated liquid, which has begun to be used to feed livestock. In carrying out chlorella production work, various localities have adopted the method of training technicians, building ponds, and producing at the same time, so development has been rapid. According to recent statistics, eleven counties (cities) and thirty-six people's communes in Jinan, Zibo, Heze, Linyi and other regions alone have produced more than 6 million catties of chlorella culture solution, and more than 2 million catties of concentrated solution and dry powder, most of which has been used as concentrated feed for livestock.

(Our Dispatch) The Satellite Brigade of Jiuxian Commune is the banner of pig raising in Jiuxian Commune, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province. In recent years, thanks to the establishment of a feed base and the efforts to increase the planting of pig feed, feed has been kept full in storage all year round, which has powerfully promoted the development of pig raising.

The number of pigs in the Satellite Brigade has increased year by year, especially since 1959. The number of pigs in stock has increased from 606 in 1957 to 1,103 at the end of 1959, and further increased to 1,285 in the first half of this year. The whole brigade has an average of 1.54 pigs per person and 1.34 pigs per mu of cultivated land. Since 1958, they have also overfulfilled the state's task of transferring fat pigs every year.

At the beginning of 1959, the team fixed 68.5 mu of feed base, and organized a professional team for feed production. At the same time, 3 to 5 pigs' manure per mu of feed land was fixed as special fertilizer, and a three-special system of special land, special personnel and special fertilizer was established, which solved the three contradictions of grain production and feed production competing for land, people and fertilizer. The method of determining output by land and work by output was implemented, with a yield of 50,000 catties of green and coarse feed and 500 catties of concentrated feed per mu, and 2 work points were given for every 100 catties of green feed and 1.5 work points per catty of concentrate. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the feeders, and everyone carefully planted to make every piece of feed land high-yielding. After delineating the feed base, they made comprehensive arrangements, and according to the growth rules and maturity seasons of various feed crops, widely carried out comprehensive intercropping of early and late maturing, tall and short stalks, and grains and vegetables, adopting the method of competing for every inch of land, inserting whenever there is a gap, and planting while harvesting, even planting beans as feed on the edges of the fields.

The general planting method for feed land is: in spring, sweet potatoes are the main crop, intercropped with corn. In February, early sweet potatoes are planted in the previous crop of kale, about 3,000 nests per mu, two rows of sweet potatoes and one row of early corn, about 460 nests, and autumn corn is planted after the early corn is harvested. When the sweet potato seedlings are three or four inches long, all the kale is harvested. The feed land is fertilized every five days, cultivated every ten and a half months, and the first mowing is started when the vines are two feet long, and then mowed every half month. Sorghum is planted around the land, intercropped with cowpeas, and twenty to thirty nests of pumpkins are planted on the edge of the land, and amaranth is planted in the gaps between the rows. By the time the sweet potatoes are dug up in early August, the vines have been mowed ten times, yielding 20,000 to 26,000 catties of sweet potato vines, and 2,500 to 3,000 catties of sweet potatoes; at the same time, 575 catties of corn, 1,000 catties of corn stalks and hearts, 500 to 1,000 catties of pumpkins, 20 catties of sorghum, and 800 catties of various green and coarse feeds are harvested. In autumn and winter, radishes and kale are mainly planted, intercropped with broad beans, and trumpet beans are added on the edge of the land. Radishes are planted with a row spacing of one foot and a nest spacing of eight inches, about 4,500 nests per mu. At the end of September, one row of radishes is pulled up every other row, and kale is planted. In November, all the radishes are pulled up and all kale is planted, which can yield 5,000 catties of radishes, more than 3,900 catties of seedlings, and 6,000 catties of kale, 30 catties of broad beans, and 300 catties of straw and leaves in February of the following year. In total, one mu of feed land can yield 625 catties of concentrated feed, 8,000 catties of sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and radishes, and 32,000 catties of green and coarse feed, enough for eight pigs to eat for a year.

The main experience of high-yield feed in the Satellite Brigade is: fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of feed managers, implementing a feed professional team form of specialized responsibility for contracting output, setting work and recording remuneration, which can concentrate experienced commune members and give play to the wisdom of the masses, and carefully plant the feed land. Make full use of natural resources such as land, sunshine, rain, and heat, rationally match crops, conscientiously implement the eight-character constitution of agriculture, and engage in large-scale feed production methods. Taking these effective measures, one mu of land can raise eight pigs. (Attached picture)

    饲料准备工作走在畜牧业大发展前面
    山东抓紧时机大采大种饲料
    四川武胜县卫星大队建立饲料基地保证猪只年年增加
    本报济南30日电　山东各地抓紧有利时机，突击抢种、采集饲草饲料，为牲畜大发展提供可靠的物质基础。全省四十多万处饲养场一百万饲养大军是大种大采饲料的骨干。据统计，目前各地已播种饲料达一百七十万亩，现正充分利用空闲地种植饲料七十多万亩。饲料地的播种面积正在不断扩大。
    山东省今年畜牧业发展形势很好，省委要求在目前基础上到年底再来个大发展。为了适应畜牧业发展的需要，各地狠狠抓住大搞饲料饲草生产，力争饲草饲料的准备工作走在畜牧生产大发展的前面。目前全省饲养专业队伍与广大群众锄草灭荒运动相结合，展开了突击抢种饲草饲料。临沂地区发动了四十三万人，在采集饲草饲料的同时，已种植饲料三十七万七千多亩。烟台地区的招远、蓬莱、文登、海阳等县在7月中旬，就种植饲料地一万八千多亩。寿张县石门宋公社，根据秋后生猪发展计划，种植饲料地五百亩，并固定一个专业队专门管理饲料的种植和收藏。目前，这个社春播的二十亩根达菜，即将开始采收喂猪。为了把饲料地种好、管好，力争高产多收，各县、社、队的饲养场都固定专业队进行管理，向自力更生方面发展。宁阳、寿张、郯城、齐河等县的养猪场，由于饲料种植管理好，种植的早熟瓜菜，已陆续开始收获。宁阳、寿张等县社的部分养猪场由于采取了自力更生的方针，基本上达到饲料自给自足。
    各地在大种大采饲草饲料的同时，还积极发动群众开展小球藻生产，许多地区并已生产出大批浓缩液，开始用于喂养牲畜。各地在开展小球藻生产的工作中，都采取了边训练技术人员、边建池、边生产的方法，因而发展很快。据最近统计，仅济南、淄博、菏泽、临沂等地区的十一个县（市）、三十六处人民公社即已生产出小球藻培养液六百多万斤，浓缩液、干粉二百多万斤，其中绝大部分已用作牲畜精饲料。
    本报讯　旧县公社卫星大队是四川省武胜县旧县公社的养猪旗帜。几年来由于建立了饲料基地，千方百计地增种猪饲料，做到了饲料常年满仓，有力地促进了养猪事业的发展。
    卫星大队猪只年年增加，特别是1959年以来发展得更快。猪的存栏头数由1957年的六百零六头，发展到1959年底的一千一百零三头，到今年上半年更增至一千二百八十五头。全大队平均每人有猪一点五四头，每亩耕地有猪一点三四头。从1958年以来，他们还连年超额完成了国家外调肥猪的任务。
    1959年初，该队固定了六十八点五亩饲料基地，并组织了饲料生产专业队。同时每亩饲料地固定三至五头猪的粪作专用肥，建立了专地、专人、专肥的三专制度，解决了粮食生产与饲料生产争地争人争肥的三争矛盾。实行了以地定产，以产定工的办法，亩产青粗饲料五万斤、精饲料五百斤，每交青饲料一百斤给两工分，精料一斤半工分。这就大大激发了饲料员的积极性，人人精心种植，要块块饲料地高产。他们在划定饲料基地后，就作出了全面安排，根据各种饲料作物的生长规律、成熟季节，广泛开展早熟与晚熟、高秆与矮秆、粮食与菜类的综合间作，采取寸土必争、见缝就插、边收边种的办法，连田埂边缘地也种上豆类作饲料。
    饲料地的一般种法是：大春以红苕（即甘薯）为主，间种苞谷。2月份在前作物牛皮菜地里种上早红苕，每亩约三千窝，两行红苕一行早苞谷，约四百六十窝，收了早苞谷种秋苞谷。待红苕出苗三、四寸长时，将牛皮菜全部收完。饲料地采取五天一施肥，十天半月一中耕，藤长两尺时开始割第一次，以后每半月割一次。地四周栽高粱，间种豇豆，地边种南瓜二三十窝，行间空隙栽苋菜。到8月初挖苕时共割藤十次，收苕藤二万至二万六千斤，挖苕二千五百至三千斤；同时收苞谷五百七十五斤，苞谷秆苞谷心一千斤，收南瓜五百至一千斤，高粱二十斤，各种青粗饲料八百斤。秋冬季以种萝卜、牛皮菜为主，间种葫豆，地边增种张口葫豆。种萝卜行距一尺，窝距八寸，每亩约种四千五百窝。9月末隔行扯一行萝卜，栽牛皮菜。11月份扯完萝卜全栽牛皮菜，可收萝卜五千斤，秧茵等三千九百多斤，来年2月份收牛皮菜六千斤，葫豆三十斤，秆叶三百斤。总计一亩饲料地可收精饲料六百二十五斤，红苕、南瓜、萝卜八千斤，青粗饲料三万二千斤，足够八头猪吃一年。
    卫星大队饲料高产的主要经验是：充分调动饲料管理人员的积极性，实行专人专责包产定工记酬的饲料专业队形式，可以集中有经验的社员和发挥群众智慧，精心种好饲料地。充分利用自然资源如土地、阳光、雨水、热量等，作物之间合理搭配，认真贯彻农业八字宪法，大搞饲料丰产方。采取这些有效措施，一亩地养八头猪是可以做到的。（附图片）
