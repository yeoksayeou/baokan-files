Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: The Japanese people, advancing victoriously in their anti-American patriotic struggle, have decided to launch the 21st national unified action against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" from July 10th to 15th.

This was decided at a meeting of the executive secretaries of the National Council for Preventing the Revision of the "Security Treaty" on the 4th.

The meeting decided that on July 10th, a mass rally will be held in Yamato City near the Atsugi U.S. Air Force Base, demanding the withdrawal of U-2 jet aircraft and U.S. troops from Japan. It will also announce non-recognition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The decision stated that 50,000 people from Tokyo, Kanagawa, Kanto, and other regions will participate in the rally.

According to the decision, a large-scale mass rally of 200,000 people from all over the country will be held near the Diet on July 14th, opposing the organization of a Nobusuke Kishi-style cabinet, protesting the authorities' attempts to take punitive measures against participants in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement, and declaring the new "Security Treaty" invalid.

The decision stated that the National Council for Preventing the Revision of the "Security Treaty" and its various local councils should immediately begin preparations for holding the mass rally.

The 20th National Unified Action of the Japanese people ended victoriously on July 2nd.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: The Japanese Socialist Party held a Central Committee meeting today, deciding to exert its utmost efforts to launch a movement against the "Security Treaty" and for democracy among the broadest masses of all strata, and to struggle for the establishment of a government that pursues a policy of peace, neutrality, and democracy.

The meeting also decided to draw strength from the unprecedentedly high tide of the Japanese people's movement against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to strive for an early dissolution of the Diet and victory in the upcoming general election.

The meeting adopted a statement saying that the Japanese people's indomitable struggle against the new "Security Treaty" has opened up prospects for a peaceful, neutral Japan.

The statement pointed out that although the Japanese reactionaries have suffered unprecedented blows, they are still trying to intensify repression against the people, delay the general election, and conspire to form a Nobusuke Kishi-style cabinet in order to implement a militarist system in Japan. The statement said that all members of the Socialist Party should now rise up and wage relentless struggles.

The current policy guidelines adopted by the meeting stipulate that the Socialist Party will take non-recognition of the new "Security Treaty" and the smashing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty system, as well as the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, and the establishment of friendly relations with all countries as its current important tasks, and will strive to defend democracy, establish a parliamentary government, implement economic democratization, and improve the social insurance system.

The policy guidelines stated that if the Socialist Party wins the general election, it will organize a democratic government in cooperation with other political forces and pursue a policy of neutrality.

The meeting also decided to increase the number of Socialist Party candidates participating in the general election from 167 in the last election to more than 200.

According to the meeting's decision, the Socialist Party will hold meetings of activists from each prefectural party organization in July to discuss specific policies for conducting the general election.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: Approximately 2,000 workers from fifteen industrial trade unions held a rally and demonstration in front of the Ministry of Transport today, protesting the authorities' plans to punish workers who participated in strikes against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The main participants in today's demonstration were members of the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union.

Twenty representatives elected by the rally held negotiations with the Minister of Transport and the authorities of the National Railway Corporation. After the negotiations, the head of the workers' delegation reported to the workers at the rally that the spokesperson of the National Railway Corporation declared that even if the cabinet is changed, punitive measures will be taken against the workers. The head of the workers' delegation emphasized that the statement by the spokesperson of the National Railway Corporation proves the consistent policy of suppressing workers pursued by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

Representatives of various trade unions stated unanimously at the rally that they are determined to join all the Japanese people in the struggle against any measures to punish strikers.

Approximately 500 government employees also held a similar gathering in front of the Ministry of Finance, protesting the authorities' attempts to punish those who participated in strikes against the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: The National Council for Preventing the Revision of the "Security Treaty" issued a statement today, protesting the Nobusuke Kishi government's arrest of patriots who participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the repression of the people of Gunma Prefecture is a premeditated action by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. Since May, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet has been preparing to launch an attack on the democratic groups in Gunma Prefecture, which are the most advanced in carrying out the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

The statement said that the attack on the people of Gunma Prefecture is a serious interference in the local elections in Gunma Prefecture. It is no coincidence that the suppression was carried out immediately after the announcement of the election of the governor of this prefecture.

The statement said that the "National Council" cannot tolerate the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet's brutal behavior against the anti-"Security Treaty" fighters, and it will resolutely protest the suppression.

The movement protesting the Nobusuke Kishi government's illegal suppression of patriots is rapidly unfolding throughout Gunma Prefecture. Today, 1,000 railway workers held a demonstration in Takasaki, protesting the arrest of railway employees. Yesterday, protest demonstrations were held in Shibukawa, Kiryu, Isesaki, and Maebashi, among other cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: The Nobusuke Kishi government openly suppressed the Japanese people's patriotic and democratic movement and arrested a total of twenty cadres of local Communist and Socialist Party organizations and workers in Gunma Prefecture today.

Japanese police mobilized this morning and raided the homes of cadres of local Socialist and Communist Party organizations and cadres of the National Railway Workers' Union, the prefectural government employee union, the Japan-Korea Association, and the Japan Chemical Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, conducting searches and arrests. The "crimes" of those arrested were participating in the June 4th general strike against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Gunma Prefecture Democratic League and the Gunma Prefecture Local Council immediately held an emergency joint meeting this morning. The meeting decided to establish a countermeasure committee against the suppression, and jointly issued a statement in the names of the Gunma Prefecture Democratic League, the Gunma Prefecture Local Council, the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, and the Socialist and Communist Party organizations in Gunma Prefecture, seriously protesting the Nobusuke Kishi government's illegal suppression of workers and people participating in the anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle.

The meeting also dispatched representatives to the Gunma Prefecture Police Headquarters to protest and demand the immediate release of those arrested. The delegation also went to the Maebashi City Police Station and the local prosecutor's office to protest.

The statement firmly stated that in order to strive for Japan's peace and independence, to safeguard the people's lives and rights, to declare the new "Security Treaty" invalid, to oppose the establishment of a second Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, to force the dissolution of the Diet, and to oppose illegal suppression, they will continue to launch the 21st and 22nd unified actions and fight the enemy to the end.

The statement called on all the people of Gunma Prefecture to participate in their struggle together. (Attached picture)

    新华社5日讯　东京消息：在反美爱国斗争中乘胜前进的日本人民，决定从7月10日到15日展开反对日美“安全条约”的第二十一次全国统一行动。
    这是日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议在4日的干事会议上决定的。
    会议决定，7月10日，将在厚木美国空军基地附近的山都市举行群众大会，要求从日本撤退U—2型喷气式飞机和美国军队。并且宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”。这个决定说，来自东京、神奈川、关东以及其他地区的五万人将参加这次大会。
    根据决定，7月14日将在国会附近举行包括来自各地的二十万人民参加的大规模群众大会，反对组织岸信介式的内阁，抗议当局对反对“安全条约”运动的参加者采取惩罚措施的企图，并且宣布新“安全条约”无效。
    决定说，阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议和它的各个地方会议应该立即开始为举行群众大会作准备工作。
    日本人民第二十次全国统一行动是在7月2日胜利结束的。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天举行中央委员会会议，决定尽最大的力量在最广泛的各阶层群众中展开反对“安全条约”和争取民主的运动，为成立一个奉行和平、中立和民主政策的政府而斗争。
    会议还决定从日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的空前高涨的运动中吸取力量，争取早日解散国会和在未来的大选中取得胜利。
    会议通过声明说，日本人民反对新“安全条约”的不屈不挠的斗争，打开了和平、中立的日本的前景。
    声明指出，尽管日本反动派受到空前的打击，但是仍在力图对人民加紧进行镇压，拖延大选，并且阴谋成立岸信介式的内阁，以便在日本实行军国主义制度。声明说，所有的社会党人现在应当奋起，进行不懈的斗争。
    会议通过的当前政策方针规定，社会党将以不承认新“安全条约”和粉碎日美军事同盟条约体系以及恢复日中邦交、缔结日苏和约，同一切国家建立友好关系为当前的重要任务，并且为保卫民主、建立议会政府、实行经济民主化和改善社会保险制度而奋斗。
    政策方针说，社会党如果在大选中获得胜利，它将在其他政治力量的合作下组织民主政府，奉行中立政策。
    会议还决定把社会党参加大选的候选人人数从上次选举中的一百六十七名增加到二百多名。
    根据会议的决定，社会党将在7月里举行各县级党组织的积极分子会议，讨论进行大选的具体政策。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本十五个产业工会属下的大约两千名工人今天在运输省门前举行大会和示威，抗议当局计划处罚曾经参加反对新日美“安全条约”罢工的工人。参加今天示威的主要是国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会的会员。
    这次大会选出的二十名代表同运输相和国营铁道公司当局举行了谈判。谈判之后，工人代表团团长在大会上向工人报告说：国营铁道公司的发言人宣称，即使更换了内阁也要对工人采取惩罚措施。工人代表团的这位团长强调说，国营铁道公司发言人的这一谈话，证明了美日反动分子一贯奉行的镇压工人的政策。
    各个工会的代表们在大会上发言时一致表示，他们决心同所有日本人民一起，进行反对任何惩罚罢工者的措施的斗争。
    大约五百名政府雇员在大藏省门前也举行了类似的集会，抗议当局企图惩罚参加反对新“安全条约”的罢工者。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议今天发表声明，抗议岸信介政府逮捕参加反对“安全条约”斗争的爱国者。
    声明说，对群马县人民的镇压是岸信介内阁的预谋行动。从5月份起，岸信介内阁就在准备对开展反对“安全条约”运动最先进的群马县的民主团体发动进攻。
    声明说，对群马县人民的进攻是对群马县地方选举的严重干涉。在宣布选举这个县的县长之后立即进行镇压，这不是偶然的。
    声明说，“国民会议”不能容忍岸信介内阁对反对“安全条约”的战士的这种残暴行为，它将坚决抗议镇压。
    抗议岸信介政府非法镇压爱国者的运动正在群马县各地迅速展开。今天，一千名铁道工人在高崎举行示威，抗议逮捕铁路员工。昨天，在涩川、桐生、伊势崎和前桥市等地都举行了抗议示威。
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府公然镇压日本人民爱国民主运动，今天逮捕了群马县的共产党、社会党地方组织干部和工人共二十人。
    日本警察在今天清晨出动，袭击了社会党、共产党地方组织干部和国营铁道工会、县政府职员工会、日朝协会、日本化学药品工会干部的住宅，进行搜捕。被捕者的“罪名”是参加了反对新日美“安全条约”的6月4日总罢工。
    群马县拥护民主联盟和群马县地方评议会今天上午随即举行紧急联席会议。会议决定成立镇压对策委员会，并且以群马县拥护民主联盟、群马县地方评议会和全日本农民协会联合会、社会党、共产党群马县组织名义联合发表声明，严重抗议岸信介政府非法镇压参加反美反岸爱国斗争的工人和人民。
    会议并且派遣代表到群马县警察总署进行抗议，要求立即释放被捕者。代表团还到前桥市警察署和地方检察厅提出抗议。
    声明坚决表示，为争取日本的和平和独立，为维护人民的生活和权利，为宣布新“安全条约”无效，反对成立第二个岸信介内阁，迫使解散国会，反对非法镇压，他们将继续展开第二十一次、二十二次统一行动，同敌人斗争到底。
    声明呼吁全体群马县民一同参加他们的斗争。（附图片）
