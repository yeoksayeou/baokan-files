    Helping the Commune Transport Public Grain
    The employees of the Tangtouxia Station on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau learned that nearby communes had over 10,000 dan of public grain that couldn't be transported to the granary in time due to labor shortages. It would take more than 5,000 workdays to carry this amount of grain into the granary by manual labor. However, the commune was busy with the summer harvest and planting, and it would be difficult to divert so much labor at once. Faced with this situation, the employees of Tangtouxia Station, under the leadership of the Party branch, immediately borrowed handcarts from the work zone and worked day and night to transport public grain for the commune, but could only transport a little over a hundred dan each night. Therefore, the station employees reported the specific situation to the higher authorities, requesting them to make an exception for trains to stop at Tiantangwei and Tangtouxia during gaps in the schedule to load and transport public grain. With the strong support of the Shenzhen Central Station and the close coordination of the dispatching office, they used the gaps in the schedule and spent only nineteen minutes loading five cars of public grain.
    After the train carrying public grain arrived at Tangtouxia Station, the railway workers immediately began unloading. Under the leadership of Zhang Yongwei, the deputy secretary of the railway Party committee, the workers unloaded all five cars in just thirty-two minutes, ensuring that the grain was promptly stored in the granary.

    帮助公社运公粮
    广州铁路局广深线塘头厦车站的职工们，知道附近公社有一万多担公粮，因为劳动力紧张，没能及时运往粮库。这一万多担公粮入库，如果用人力来挑，需要五千多个劳动日才能完成。但是公社正忙于夏收夏种，一下子要抽调这么多劳动力有不少困难。面对着这个情况，塘头厦站的职工，在党支部的领导下，立即向工区借来了手推车，日夜苦战，替公社运公粮，但是每晚只能运一百多担。于是，这个站的职工，把具体情况向上级作了汇报，请求上级利用空隙时间，要列车破例在天堂围、塘头厦之间停车装运公粮。由于深圳中心站的大力支持，调度所的密切配合，结果利用空隙时间，仅用了十九分钟，装了五车公粮。
    装运公粮的列车，到达塘头厦站后，铁路职工们立即进行抢卸。职工们在铁路党委副书记张勇为同志的带动下，仅用了三十二分钟卸完了五个车，使这批公粮及时入了库。
