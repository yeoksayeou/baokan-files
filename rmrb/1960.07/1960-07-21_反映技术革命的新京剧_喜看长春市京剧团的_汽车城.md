    A New Peking Opera Reflecting the Technological Revolution
    ——A Joyful Look at the Changchun Peking Opera Troupe's "Automobile City"
    Lin Hanbiao
    How to express industrial construction, the great inventions of the working class, and the current vigorous technological revolution movement through the artistic form of Peking Opera is an important topic for the current reform of Peking Opera art. There are not many such attempts yet, and the Changchun Peking Opera Troupe has made valuable artistic practice in this regard. They brought into play collective wisdom, promoted the spirit of innovation, and used the artistic form of Peking Opera to create and publicly perform the modern-themed Peking Opera "Automobile City," which reflects the technological revolution movement.
    "Automobile City" depicts the struggle between advanced, continuously revolutionary thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking in the technological revolution movement. Through the arrangement of interesting dramatic plots, it vividly portrays the artistic images of young worker Wang Guodong, young technician Feng Lanying, and the head of the industrial department, Director Feng, and others. The dramatic conflict unfolds quickly: the engine workshop of the automobile manufacturing plant cannot keep up with the leap forward situation, and the key problem lies in the slow speed of the diamond knife boring machine. Young worker Wang Guodong proposes to improve the boring machine, and mobilizes the masses, consults with technician Feng Lanying, uses his brain, and makes every effort to experiment. However, the head of the industrial department, Director Feng, and technician Fan Zhixiang are superstitious about technical equipment and experts, believing that the boring machine is currently the most advanced equipment in the world, and even experts and professors cannot improve it, and no principles for improving the boring machine can be found in books, and Wang Guodong's attempt to improve the boring machine is "playing wildly" and "fooling around." An ideological struggle finally breaks out. Young technician Feng Lanying supports Wang Guodong's technological revolution, and is ridiculed by Fan Zhixiang; when Wang Guodong humbly asks Fan Zhixiang for advice, Fan Zhixiang treats our advanced workers with an intolerable bourgeois aristocratic attitude. As for Director Feng, he is busy all day long, working hard, and although he wants to do a good job, he does not rely on the technological revolution of the workers, or the creative spirit of the workers, but only sees that the machine equipment cannot be improved, and does not see the subjective initiative of people; he only hopes that experts will come to solve the technical problems quickly, and does not believe that a third-grade worker can invent and create; he wants to improve production efficiency, but only focuses on adding equipment or working overtime. He opposes Wang Guodong's boring machine improvement experiment. Director Feng's right-leaning conservative thinking was criticized by the Party. Secretary Xu severely criticized him, and the masses also posted big-character posters about him. The technological revolution carried out by Wang Guodong and others finally succeeded with the support of the Party, and Director Feng was also educated in the face of the facts. The contradictions revealed by "Automobile City" are meaningful. Through a series of artistic image portrayals, it praises the creative spirit of the working masses, praises the technological revolution movement, and criticizes and satirizes right-leaning conservative thinking, giving us profound education.
    The descriptions of Wang Guodong, Feng Lanying, Fan Zhixiang, Director Feng, and other characters in "Automobile City" are not generalized, and the images are quite vivid. It can be seen that the playwright is good at using typical detailed descriptions to express the personality characteristics of these characters. Wang Guodong's tireless study of technology late at night, Feng Lanying's argument with her brother Director Feng, Fan Zhixiang's invitation to Feng Lanying to watch a movie, and other scenes are full of rich life colors, with clear attitudes and are quite humorous. In terms of stage art, a series of artistic innovations have also been carried out. For example, in terms of singing and musical accompaniment, there are many new creations, which play a good role in setting off the plot and expressing the personality of the characters. The singing of the role of Fan Zhixiang breaks through the falsetto singing method of Peking Opera Xiaosheng; the singing of Director Feng and Feng Lanying is closely integrated with the development needs of the plot, with more changes in the musical structure, brisk and neat interludes, and a strong sense of rhythm. These are all good innovations, giving people a feeling of harmony, coordination, freshness, and liveliness. In terms of performance art, there are also many new creations. For example, Fan Zhixiang's body movements and steps are very characteristic of life, fully expressing the frivolous and vulgar style of this character, but they are movements transformed from Peking Opera routines; Director Feng's performance is clearly purposeful, neat and sharp, with a strong sense of rhythm, natural and appropriate. In addition, some of the dances in the mass scenes use Peking Opera dance routines, which are relatively natural, such as the first scene and the last scene of "reporting good news," which use tumbling and wrestling skills and dances with large red flags and red silk, forming a magnificent and colorful scene, expressing the great spirit of the working class.
    I think the shortcoming of the current performance version of this play is that the depiction of opposing right-leaning conservative thinking is not deep and powerful enough, and the artistic images of positive characters such as Wang Guodong and Feng Lanying have not been written more vividly and fully in the struggle. The characters who are criticized and satirized, such as Director Feng and Fan Zhixiang, are also not written completely enough. Director Feng has more serious right-leaning conservative thinking, and Secretary Xu criticized him in a timely manner, and the masses also posted big-character posters about him. Such descriptions are necessary, but on the stage, we feel that his understanding of his mistakes is not very deep, and his self-ideological struggle has not been fully depicted, and then he suddenly changes. Fan Zhixiang has serious bourgeois ideological consciousness from his political thinking to his lifestyle. The playwright satirized him in some places, but did not conduct a serious criticism of him, especially his bourgeois thinking of despising the working masses, and did not launch a positive struggle. Fan Zhixiang's transformation at the end of the play is also very sudden. The criticism of the representatives of right-leaning conservative thinking is not powerful enough or deep enough, which cannot but make the positive characters less brilliant, and Secretary Xu also appears weak and powerless, which affects the ideology of the play.

    反映技术革命的新京剧
    ——喜看长春市京剧团的“汽车城”
    林涵表
    怎样以京剧艺术形式表现工业建设，表现工人阶级伟大的创造发明，表现当前轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动，这是当前京剧艺术革新的一个重要课题。这样的尝试还不太多，长春市京剧团在这方面作了可贵的艺术实践。他们发挥了集体的智慧，发扬了革新的精神，运用了京剧的艺术形式，创作并公演了反映技术革命运动的现代题材京剧《汽车城》。
    《汽车城》描写了技术革命运动中先进的、不断革命的思想和右倾保守思想的斗争。它通过有趣的戏剧情节的安排，生动地表现了青年工人王国栋、青年技术员冯兰英、工部主任冯主任等人物的艺术形象。戏剧冲突很快地就展开了：汽车制造厂发动机车间赶不上跃进形势，关键问题在于金钢刀镗床的速度慢。青年工人王国栋提出动手改进镗床，并发动群众、请教技术员冯兰英，动脑筋，千方百计地作实验。而工部主任冯主任和技术员范志祥，却迷信于技术设备，迷信专家，认为镗床是目前世界上最新的设备，专家教授都没法改进，书本上也找不出改进镗床的道理，王国栋要改进镗床，是“乱弹琴”，是“瞎胡闹”。一场思想斗争终于爆发了。青年技术员冯兰英支持王国栋的技术革命，遭到范志祥的冷嘲热讽；当王国栋虚心地向范志祥请教的时候，范志祥竟以不能容忍的资产阶级贵族老爷式的态度对待我们的先进工人。而冯主任呢，他整天忙忙碌碌，辛辛苦苦地工作，虽也想把工作搞好，但他依靠的不是工人群众的技术革命，不是工人群众的创造精神，而是只看到机器设备的不可改进，看不到人的主观能动性；他只希望专家快来解决技术问题，而不相信一个三级工能发明创造；他要提高生产效率，但只在增添设备或加班加点上打主意。他反对王国栋的改进镗床的试验。冯主任的右倾保守思想受到了党的批评。许书记严肃地批评了他，群众也给他贴了大字报。王国栋等所进行的技术革命，终于在党的支持下搞成功了，冯主任也在事实面前受到了教育。《汽车城》所揭示的矛盾是有意义的。它通过一系列的艺术形象的描写，歌颂了工人群众的创造精神，歌颂了技术革命运动，批判、讽刺了右倾保守思想，给了我们深刻的教育。
    《汽车城》对于王国栋、冯兰英、范志祥、冯主任等人物的描写不一般化，形象相当鲜明。可以看出，剧作者是善于通过典型的细节描写，来表现这些人物的性格特征的。王国栋钻研技术深夜不眠、冯兰英与哥哥冯主任的争论、范志祥约冯兰英看电影等场面，都富有浓厚的生活色彩，态度鲜明，饶有风趣。在舞台艺术上，也进行了一系列的艺术革新。如唱腔、音乐伴奏方面，都有不少新的创造，使得在烘托剧情和表现人物性格方面，起了很好的作用。范志祥这一角色的唱，突破了京剧小生的假嗓唱法；冯主任和冯兰英的唱，紧密结合了剧情的发展需要，板式变化较多，过门明快利落，节奏感强，这都是很好的革新，给人以一种和谐协调、清新活泼的感受。在表演艺术上，也有不少新的创造。如范志祥的身型步法，都很有生活特色，充分表现出这个人物的轻浮、庸俗的作风，但又是从京剧程式中化出来的动作；冯主任的表演目的性明确，干净利落，节奏感强，自然得体。此外，有的群众场面的舞蹈，运用了京剧的舞蹈程式，比较自然，如最前一场和最后一场“报喜”，运用了翻、扑的武功和耍大红旗、红绸舞等的舞蹈，形成了瑰丽多彩的场面，表现了工人阶级的伟大气概。
    我觉得这出戏目前演出本中不足之处是描写反右倾保守思想还不够深刻有力，王国栋、冯兰英等正面人物的艺术形象没能在斗争中写得更为鲜明饱满，被批判被讽刺的人物如冯主任、范志祥也写得不够完整。冯主任有较严重的右倾保守思想，许书记及时批评了他，群众也给他贴了大字报，这样的描写是必要的，但是在舞台上我们感受到他认识自己的错误还不是很深刻的，他的自我思想斗争没有得到充分的描绘，便突然转变了。范志祥从政治思想到生活作风上都有严重的资产阶级思想意识，剧作者在某些地方讽刺了他，但却没有对他进行严肃的批判，特别是对他轻视工人群众的资产阶级思想，没有展开正面的斗争，范志祥在戏剧结束时的转变也是十分突然的。对右倾保守思想的代表人物批判得不够有力、不够深刻，这就不能不使正面人物减少了光彩，许书记也显得软弱无力，这就影响了这出戏的思想性。
