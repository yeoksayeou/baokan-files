Concentrate Efforts to Develop Agricultural Production, Try Every Possible Means to Expand Summer Planting Area
Sichuan and Henan Plant More Sweet Potatoes and Late Autumn Crops
Guangdong's Early Rice Harvesting is in Full Swing, Leaders at All Levels Go Deep into the Fields

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 5th. Sichuan Province, based on the spirit that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development and taking grain as the key link, concentrates its main energy on vigorously developing grain production, planting more and planting well, and trying every possible means to expand the summer planting area, striving for a bumper harvest in autumn.

According to the season, making overall plans, with plans and priorities, vigorously expanding the planting area of sweet potatoes (yams) and late rice is the central task of Sichuan Province's current planting efforts. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, all localities decisively changed paddy fields that could not be planted with mid-season rice and had no guaranteed water source to planting sweet potatoes, and planted sweet potatoes on all land that could be planted. Luzhou Prefecture, which had been suffering from drought since last winter, mobilized the masses to check each plot and plan each plot, and successively converted 1.2 million mu of paddy fields to planting sweet potatoes in a timely manner. Yibin County checked drought-stricken paddy fields and mature wasteland, and the planned area for planting sweet potatoes in the county increased from 300,000 mu to 550,000 mu, an increase of more than 80%. At the same time, all localities vigorously increased the amount of late rice sown, increased the cultivation of late rice seedlings, and carefully managed the seedling fields. Leshan Prefecture promptly expanded the original plan to plant 300,000 mu of single-season late rice to 500,000 mu. The planned area of double-cropping late rice in various places has also generally increased compared to the original.

While grasping proper planting, full planting, and exhaustive planting, all localities have taken the promotion of intercropping, relay cropping, and the use of scattered land to vigorously carry out the "searching for gaps and inserting needles" movement to increase planting as another important link in multiple planting. Lezhi County widely promoted intercropping of sweet potatoes and corn, so that more than 60% of the dry land was planted with corn. Mabian County made use of the "ten sides" such as roadsides, wallsides, and riversides to plant corn, sorghum and other crops on a large scale. After the planting plan is completed, it can be converted into more than 60,000 mu of cultivated land, accounting for about 20% of the total cultivated land in the county.

In grasping multiple planting, all localities concentrated their main forces, seized time, grasped speed, and ensured quality, showing a high degree of determination and drive. More than 80% of the labor force was used to invest in the rush planting movement. Party committee secretaries at all levels in Nanchong Prefecture went deep into the front line, contracted at each level, studied the situation, deployed battles, and personally participated in rush planting. The county party committee to the party branch secretaries of Pengxi County led tens of thousands of assault teams composed of 300,000 people, seized the rain to plant, and completed the sweet potato planting area in two major assaults. Five counties in Mianyang Prefecture were short of sweet potato seedlings, and nine counties in the entire district immediately came to support, ensuring the rapid progress of sweet potato planting in the entire area.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 5th. From June 25th to July 2nd, most areas of Henan Province experienced welcome rainfall. Twenty-eight counties (cities) had rainfall of more than 100 mm, thirty counties (cities) had more than 50 mm, and thirty-six counties (cities) had more than 25 mm. Another part of the counties and cities had about 10 mm. This rainfall was thundershowers, so the amount of rainfall varied within a county.

As of July 2nd, the province had completed 90% of the summer planting plan. Nanyang, Luoyang, Xuchang and other prefectures have completed and overfulfilled the summer planting plan. Now, these areas are launching a high tide of checking seedlings, supplementing seedlings, and field management. After checking the task planning labor force, checking the tools planning technicians, and checking the seedling conditions planning progress, Nanyang Prefecture, based on the amount of rainfall and soil quality, adopted the method of supplementing seedlings while the soil is moist, "first highlands and then plains, first sandy soil and then loess, first sweet potatoes and then other crops, first major autumn and then late autumn", and dispatched 660,000 people to replant all the missing seedlings of the crops that have been sown in the entire area.

While vigorously carrying out seedling checking and seedling supplementation, areas where the summer planting task is basically completed are also vigorously grasping the reclamation of wasteland, intercropping, relay cropping, and replanting, and trying every possible means to expand the planting area. Biyang County carried out the "six reforms" movement of changing the field into perennial cultivated land, changing the mountain slopes into terraced fields, changing wasteland into good fields, changing single crops into mixed crops, changing low-lying land into paddy fields, and changing small pieces of wasteland into large pieces of cultivated land, expanding the planting area by 77,000 mu. Kaifeng Prefecture implemented intercropping of forests and grains, expanding the planting area by 400,000 mu.

Areas with good water sources and rain that has relieved the drought have set off a high tide of vigorously developing high-yield fields and vigorously developing overproduction movements. The high-yield area in Xiangcheng County, Changge, Shangshui and other counties reached more than 50%.

Xinyang and other areas with heavy rainfall are vigorously carrying out rush planting and seedling supplementation while taking active measures to prevent floods and drain water, and seizing favorable opportunities to store and conserve water. The three-level secretaries of the prefectural committee, county, and commune took the lead and carried out the "five full" movement centered on reservoirs, lakes, ponds, weirs, and dams.

Areas with very little rainfall continue to stubbornly persist in fighting drought, rushing to plant, and protecting seedlings from drought. All counties have taken effective measures to provide support. For example, Sanmenxia City organized more than 30,000 people to adopt the method of "five groups" (power machinery, waterwheels, punt poles, winches, buckets) to concentrate on attacking areas with severe drought and less rainfall, so that 4,700 mu of land that had not been irrigated was irrigated.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 5th. The early rice harvesting work in Guangdong Province has been fully launched. At present, more than 5 million labor troops in the province have waved their sickles and set off a hot wave of fast harvesting and fast beating, careful harvesting and careful beating. More than 9 million mu of early rice have been harvested in the province.

This year, Guangdong has suffered continuous attacks from natural disasters such as drought, cold, wind, and floods from early rice sowing and transplanting to harvesting. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of farmers relied on the unparalleled power of the People's Commune and successively overcame various disasters. Except for a few areas that suffered heavy losses and reduced production due to severe disasters, some areas still maintained their harvests, and a considerable number of areas achieved bumper harvests. In order to ensure that every grain is returned to the barn, the People's Communes in various places have implemented measures such as harvesting one piece as it ripens, harvesting without missing a plant, beating without losing a grain, bundling without wrapping the ears, and carrying without dropping grain during the summer harvest.

In order to make the summer harvest work fast and good, all localities in the province have adopted the measures of "concentrating leadership, concentrating labor, concentrating departments, and concentrating tools" to strengthen the leadership of the summer harvest front line and enrich the labor force of the summer harvest front line. The leading cadres at all levels who have recently settled in the grassroots also personally go deep into the fields and participate in the harvest with the commune members, and help solve various specific problems.

    集中力量发展农业生产　千方百计扩大夏种面积
    四川河南多种红薯和晚秋作物
    广东早稻收割全面展开，各级领导干部深入田间
    本报成都5日电　四川省根据农业是国民经济发展的基础和以粮为纲的精神，集中主要精力，大抓粮食生产，多种、种好，千方百计扩大夏种面积，力争秋季大丰收。
    根据季节，通盘考虑，有计划，有重点，大力扩大红苕（甘薯）和晚稻的种植面积，是四川省当前多种的中心。全省各地根据省委指示，当机立断，把不能栽中稻并无水源保证的稻田改种红苕，把一切能种的地都种上红苕。从去冬以来一直受旱的泸州专区，发动群众逐块检查，逐块规划，先后把一百二十万亩稻田及时改种了红苕。宜宾县查受旱稻田，查熟荒，全县栽种红苕的计划面积就由三十万亩扩大到五十五万亩，增加80％以上。和这同时，各地大力增加晚稻播种量，增育晚稻秧，精心管好秧田。乐山专区把原计划栽种三十万亩的一季晚稻及时扩大为五十万亩。各地计划的双季晚稻面积也普遍比原来增加。
    在抓正种、种满、种尽的同时，各地把推广间种、套种，并利用零星土地大搞“寻缝插针”的增种运动作为多种的另一个重要环节。乐至县广泛推行红苕、玉米间种，使60％以上的旱地都种上了玉米。马边县利用路旁、墙旁、河旁等“十旁”大种玉米、高粱等作物，栽种计划完成后可折合耕地面积六万多亩，占全县总耕地面积的20％左右。
    在抓多种中，各地都集中主要力量，抢时间，抓速度，保质量，显示了高度的决心和干劲。各地都用了80％以上的劳动力投入抢种运动。南充专区各级党委书记都深入第一线，层层包干，研究情况，部署战斗，亲自参加抢栽抢种。蓬溪县从县委到党支部的各级书记带领由三十万人组成的上万个突击队，趁雨抢种，两次大突击就种完了红苕正种面积。绵阳专区有五个县苕苗不足，全区马上就有九个县起来支援，保证了全区抢栽红苕飞速进展。
    本报郑州5日电　河南省从6月25日到7月2日大部地区普降喜雨。雨量在一百毫米以上的有二十八个县（市）、五十毫米以上的三十个县（市）、二十五毫米以上的三十六个县（市），另有一部分县市在十毫米左右。这次降雨是雷阵雨，因此在一个县范围内降雨量也大小不同。
    截至7月2日止，全省已完成夏播计划的90％。南阳、洛阳、许昌等专区，已经完成和超额完成了夏播计划。现在，这些地区正在掀起查苗补苗和田间管理高潮。南阳专区在查任务规划劳力，查工具规划技术人员，查苗情规划进度后，根据降雨大小和土质情况，采取了“先岗地后平原，先沙土后黄土，先红薯后其它作物，先大秋后晚秋”的趁墒补种办法，出动六十六万人，将全区已播作物的缺苗，全部补种。
    在大力开展查苗补苗的同时，夏播任务基本结束的地区又大抓开垦荒地，套作、间作、复播，千方百计扩大播种面积。泌阳县开展改场地为常年耕地，改山坡为梯田，改荒地为良田，改单作为混作，改洼地为水田，改小片荒地为大块耕地的“六改”运动，扩大播种面积七点七万亩。开封专区实行林粮间作，扩大播种面积四十万亩。
    水源好和下透雨解除旱象的地区，掀起了大搞丰产方，大搞超产运动高潮。襄城县、长葛、商水等县丰产方面积达到50％以上。
    信阳等雨量较大的地区，在大力开展趁墒抢种和查苗补苗的同时，一方面积极作好防汛排涝工作，一方面抓紧有利时机蓄水保水。由地委、县、公社三级书记挂帅，开展了以库、湖、塘、堰、坝为中心的“五满”运动。
    降雨量很小的地方继续顽强地坚持抗旱抢种，抗旱保苗。各县并采取有效措施进行支援。如三门峡市组织三万多人采取“五群”（动力机械、水车、撑杆、辘轳、水桶）上阵的办法，集中突击干旱严重、落雨较小的地区，使四千七百亩没有浇过的土地得到了灌溉。
    据新华社广州5日电　广东省早稻收割工作已经全面展开。目前，全省已有五百多万劳动大军挥镰上阵，掀起了快收快打，细收细打的热潮，全省已收割早稻九百多万亩。
    今年广东从早稻播种、插秧到收割，连续遭受旱、寒、风、涝等自然灾害的袭击。但广大农民在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的无比威力，先后战胜了各种灾害。除少数地区因受灾较重而失收、减产外，仍有一部分地区保住了收成，并有相当部分地区获得了丰收。为了做到颗粒归仓，各地人民公社在夏收中，实行了熟一块、割一块，割不漏株，打不丢粒，捆不包穗，担不掉粮等措施。
    为使夏收工作进行得又快又好，目前全省各地都采取了“领导集中、劳力集中、部门集中、工具集中”的措施，来加强夏收第一线的领导，充实夏收第一线的劳动力。最近到基层落户的各级领导干部，也都亲自深入田间和社员一起参加收割，并帮助解决各种具体问题。（附图片）
