    The Baofeng Fourth Team Club of Zhangbang People's Commune in Qichun County, Hubei Province, launched 34 cultural publicity activities to serve rice transplanting. In particular, the "Omnipotent Cultural Pavilion" set up by the club in the paddy fields is most popular among the commune members. The cultural pavilion has musical instruments, newspapers and books, competition arenas, cartoons, medicines, tea, a small shop... Commune members like to go to the cultural pavilion for entertainment, reading newspapers and books, or rest during rice transplanting breaks.
    In Shangxin Street in the Nan'an District of Chongqing, there is a "pedestrian rest area" that also has newspapers, books and tea. Who doesn't want to find a place to rest when they are tired from walking on the street? It does restore the physical strength of pedestrians and provides a lot of convenience to people who come to this street. The content of the cultural pavilion in the paddy fields of Qichun is even broader. It is not only like the tea stalls under the big trees in the past, which only serve as a place to rest, but also plays a role in promoting production. It makes the form of rest greatly diversified. Rest is to eliminate fatigue and restore physical strength, in order to better devote ourselves to new battles. Those who know how to rest are the most able to fight. A unit that keeps fighting without rest, exhausting itself, will not win the battle. Not only will it not win the battle, but it will also be defeated by the enemy who is waiting for work at leisure. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Sleep and rest lose time, but gain energy for tomorrow's work. If there is any fool who does not know this principle and refuses to sleep, he will have no energy tomorrow. This is a losing business." ("Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War")
    Not only do people need to rest after labor, but they must also know how to rest and rest well. The leaders and commune members of the Baofeng Fourth Team of Zhangbang Commune know how to rest, and they deeply understand this principle. The cultural pavilion in the paddy fields can be regarded as a good example of knowing how to rest. After labor, playing a musical instrument, reading newspapers and books, or closing your eyes to rest for a while can not only regulate your spirit and increase your knowledge, but also restore your physical strength. This is indeed a good method.

　　田畈上的文化亭
　　刘丰
    湖北蕲春县张榜人民公社保丰四队俱乐部在插秧中开展了三十四项为插秧服务的文化宣传活动。特别是俱乐部在田畈上搭起的“万能文化亭”最受社员欢迎。文化亭内有乐器、书报、竞赛擂台、漫画，有药品，有茶水，有小卖部……。社员们在插秧休息的时候都喜欢到文化亭娱乐、翻阅书报或休息。
    在重庆南岸区的上新街有个“行人休息处”，那里面也有书报和茶水。谁在大街上走累了不想找个地方歇歇脚呢？它的确使行人恢复体力，并且给到这条街上来的人以很多方便。蕲春田畈上的文化亭内容包括更广，它已经不仅像过去大树荫下的茶摊仅仅起歇脚的作用了，而且对生产也起了推动作用。使休息的形式大大的多样化起来。休息是为了消除疲劳，恢复体力，是为了更好的投入新的战斗。会休息的人才是最会战斗的人，一直战斗永不休息，永不休整的部队，把自己弄得精疲力竭，那是不会打胜仗的，不仅不能打胜仗，而且还要被以逸待劳的敌人打败。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“睡眠和休息丧失了时间，却取得了明天工作的精力。如果有什么蠢人，不知此理，拒绝睡觉，他明天就没有精神了，这是蚀本生意。”（《中国革命战争的战略问题》）
    不但人劳动后必需休息，并且还要会休息，要休息得好。张榜公社保丰四队的领导和社员是会休息的，他们深深地懂得这道理。田畈上的文化亭，这可以算是会休息的好例子，劳动后吹弹一下，翻翻书报，闭目养神片刻，不仅可以调剂精神，增加知识，也可以恢复体力。这的确是一个好办法。
