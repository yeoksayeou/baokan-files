Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta. Many newspapers here have published commentaries in recent days, unanimously condemning US Chief of Naval Operations Burke's public expression of the US intention to establish a military base in Dutch-held West Irian, and exposing the US's false neutrality on the West Irian issue.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" pointed out on the 1st that, on the West Irian issue, the United States has long not adopted a neutral position. The United States not only established military bases in West Irian, but also supplied weapons to the Dutch aircraft carrier "Karel Doorman" to deal with Indonesia.

    "People's Daily" refuted Burke's fallacy that any country can send warships to any place according to its own wishes. It said that this is the blatant and shameless support of the United States for the action of the Netherlands in sending the "Karel Doorman" to West Irian. The newspaper demanded that the same resolute attitude should be adopted towards all those who support the Dutch colonialists as towards the Dutch colonialists. "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 4th saying that it is futile for US State Department spokesman White to try to deny Burke's statement that the United States will establish a military base in West Irian. Only fools would believe the imperialists' "denials."

    "Dawn Daily" published a commentary on the 1st, pointing out that the United States is clearly colluding with the Netherlands in an attempt to strengthen its colonial rule over West Irian and threaten Indonesia's position from there.

    "Dawn Daily" emphasized that the Indonesian people must recover West Irian, regardless of whether the United States has established a military base there. The newspaper demanded that the Indonesian government lodge a protest with the United States regarding its actions in West Irian.

    On the 1st, "Youth Daily" condemned Burke's remarks as brazen and extremely shameless. The newspaper demanded that the people strengthen unity and warned that no country should interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs in West Irian.

    "Eastern Star News" pointed out in an editorial published on the 4th that Burke's remarks about West Irian were a manifestation of an extremely vile and hostile attitude. A firm protest must be lodged!

    The editorial emphasized that a firm attitude should be adopted towards the United States, and a serious protest should be lodged against the US's hostile remarks towards Indonesia.

    The editorial condemned some people in Indonesia for defending US imperialism on this issue. The editorial asked, why are we hostile to China's goodwill on the overseas Chinese issue and the West Irian issue, but treat the position taken by the United States on the West Irian issue with different standards?

    Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told reporters after meeting with US Chargé d'Affaires to Indonesia Henderson on July 1 that the response to this issue "should be cautious."

    印度尼西亚舆论评伯克关于要在西伊里安设立基地的叫嚣
    谴责美国对印度尼西亚的挑衅
    苏班德里约外长说对这个问题的反应“应该审慎”
    据新华社雅加达电　这里许多报纸连日来纷纷发表评论，一致谴责美国海军作战参谋长伯克公开表示的美国要在西伊里安的荷兰蒂亚建立军事基地的企图，并揭露美国在西伊里安问题上的假中立。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”在1日指出，在西伊里安问题上，美国很久以前就一直没有采取中立立场。美国不仅在西伊里安建立军事基地，而且把武器供给荷兰航空母舰“卡雷耳·杜尔曼号”，来对付印度尼西亚。
    “人民日报”驳斥伯克所谓任何国家都可以按照它自己的意愿派遣军舰到任何地方去的谬论。它说，这是美国对荷兰派遣“卡雷耳·杜尔曼号”到西伊里安去这一行动的明目张胆的、无耻的支持。这家报纸要求应该对所有支持荷兰殖民主义者的人采取对荷兰殖民者一样的坚决态度。“人民日报”4日发表社论说，美国国务院发言人怀特企图否认伯克所说的美国将在西伊里安建立军事基地的话，是徒然的。只有傻瓜才会相信帝国主义者的“否认”。
    “黎明日报”在1日发表评论指出，美国显然正在同荷兰勾结，企图加强对西伊里安的殖民统治，并且从那里威胁印度尼西亚的地位。
    “黎明日报”强调说，印度尼西亚人民一定要收复西伊里安，不管美国是否已在那里建立军事基地。报纸要求印度尼西亚政府就美国在西伊里安的行动，向美国提出抗议。
    1日，“青年报”谴责伯克的谈话是放肆的和极其无耻的。报纸要求人民加强团结并警告说，任何国家不得干涉印度尼西亚在西伊里安的内政。
    “东星报”在4日发表的社论指出，伯克所说的关于西伊里安的话是极端恶劣的敌对态度的表现。必须坚决提出抗议！
    社论强调说，应该对美国采取坚决的态度，应该对美国敌视印度尼西亚的谈话提出严重抗议。
    社论谴责印度尼西亚有些人在这个问题上为美帝国主义辩护。社论问道，为什么我们对中国在华侨问题和西伊里安问题上表示的良好意愿抱敌对态度，却用另外的标准来对待美国在西伊里安问题上所采取的立场？
    印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在7月1日同美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办汉德逊会谈以后对报界说，对这个问题的反应“应该审慎”。
