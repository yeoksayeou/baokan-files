Xinhua News Agency report: The excellent style of cadres going deep into production to lead production and going deep into canteens to organize life has become a common practice in the Linyi area of Shandong. Recently, 120,000 cadres at all levels in the area went deep into the fields to participate in and lead production, and more than 40,000 cadres went deep into the canteens to comprehensively arrange life. There are also many cadres who go deep into the pens to be breeders and feeders, and deep into the forest farms to be foresters. In March and April of this year, all counties in the Linyi area held five-level cadre meetings, commending a group of cadres who had firm positions, were energetic, had a good mass line, went deep into reality, and had a good style of seeking truth from facts. After the meeting, the vast number of cadres in the counties, communes, and teams took the lead in going to the fields. After the leading cadres of Linyi City took the lead in going to the fields, in early May, more than 10,000 cadres in the city joined forces in the fields, eating, living, and working with the commune members.

Because the vast number of cadres go deep into the fields, acting as both commanders and fighters, as well as technicians and propagandists, they have powerfully promoted production. Zhu Yongjian, Minister of Agriculture and Industry of Junan County, went deep into the Liangdian Brigade of Shiquanhu Commune and, together with cadres and technicians, researched a rapid sweet potato seedling raising method, shortening the seedling raising time by nearly half. The vast majority of cadres in Tancheng County have achieved a combination of work, labor, and investigation and research. This county has been suffering from drought this spring, but thanks to the convergence of cadres at all levels in the fields, taking the lead in watering, digging wells, and repairing canals, the county's wheat still achieved a bumper harvest. The masses praised the cadres as: "Wherever there is difficulty, they go there; wherever the work is heavy, they go there."

Cadres from various counties also emphasized helping backward units when they joined forces in the fields. For example, the Party Committee office of Shangye Commune in Feixian County moved to the backward Wanjin Production Team, organizing 32 commune cadres to strengthen the leadership of this team, eating, living, and working with the commune members, and helping to set up canteens for the elderly, children, and patients, comprehensively arranging the lives of the commune members, and a leap forward situation emerged in production. The Lijiazhuang Commune of Tancheng sent eight cadres to "settle down" in poor teams, determined to help this team change its situation within a year. As a result, the commune members of several poor teams were greatly moved and jointly proposed measures and targets to catch up with the rich teams.

While going deep into the fields, leading cadres at all levels in the entire region also joined forces in the canteens, taking the canteens as the center to comprehensively arrange the lives of the commune members. After arriving at the canteens, they first acted as cooks, administrators, accountants, or quartermasters. While carrying water, cooking, stir-frying dishes, and doing errands, they learned about the situation, rectified, consolidated, and improved the canteens, and led the improvement of cooking tools to liberate labor. In Linyi City, 7,500 cadres, led by Zhang Xuewei, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, went deep into the canteens with poor performance. In a few days, the work of these canteens had been significantly improved.

    山东临沂专区干部深入群众
    一手抓生产　一手抓生活
    据新华社讯　深入生产，领导生产，深入食堂，组织生活，这种优良的干部作风在山东临沂地区已蔚然成风。最近一个时期，全区各级干部深入田间参加生产、领导生产的有十二万人，深入食堂、全面安排生活的有四万多人，还有很多干部深入栏圈当配种员、饲养员，深入林场当育林员。今年3、4月间，临沂地区各县召开五级干部会，表扬了一批立场坚定、干劲足、走群众路线好、深入实际好、实事求是作风好的干部，会后，各县的县、社、队广大干部都纷纷带头下田。临沂市的领导干部带头下田后，5月初，全市就有一万多名干部会师田间，与社员同吃同住同劳动。
    由于广大干部深入田间，既当指挥员，又当战斗员，既当技术员，又当宣传员，有力地推动了生产。莒南县农工部长朱永建深入石泉湖公社粮店大队，和干部、技术员一起研究出一种快速甘薯育苗法，育秧时间缩短近一半。郯城县绝大多数的干部都作到了工作、劳动、调查研究三结合。这个县今春以来久旱不雨，但由于各级干部会师田间，带头浇水，打井修渠，全县小麦仍获得丰收。群众赞扬干部是：“哪里有困难到哪里，哪里活重到哪里。”
    各县干部会师到田，还特别强调帮助后进单位，如费县上冶公社党委办公室搬到后进的万金生产队，组织三十二名公社干部加强了这个队的领导，同社员同吃同住同劳动，并帮助办起了老年人、幼儿、病人食堂，全面安排了社员生活，生产上出现跃进局面。郯城李家庄公社派了八个干部到穷队
  “安家落户”，决心要在一年内帮助这个队改变局面。结果几个穷队社员大受感动，联合提出措施和指标，一定要赶上富队。
    全专区各级领导干部，在深入田间的同时，又会师食堂，以食堂为中心，全面安排社员生活。他们到食堂后，都是先当炊事员、管理员、会计员或司务长，在挑水、作饭、炒菜、办事的同时，了解情况，对食堂进行整顿巩固提高，并领导改进炊事工具，解放劳力。临沂市七千五百名干部，在市委第一书记张学伟等带领下，深入到工作较差的食堂，几天时间，这些食堂的工作都有显著改进。
