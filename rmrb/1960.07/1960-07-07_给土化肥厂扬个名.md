    Singing Praises for the Local Fertilizer Plant
    By our reporter Liu Yu
    Can a small, locally-run fertilizer plant produce modern fertilizer? Yes, the Youth Red Flag Fertilizer Plant of the Shahe Commune in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, has already produced fifty-eight kinds of fertilizers, pesticides, and chemical raw materials.
    One day near the summer harvest, I visited the Red Flag Fertilizer Plant. Along the way, carts hauling fertilizer passed by constantly. Looking out, the vast fields were filled with rolling golden wheat. The commune members driving the carts said:
    "The wheat of Shahe Commune is strong and tall, and the fertilizer plant deserves a place of honor on the merit list." They told me that the fertilizer plant produced more than 1,680,000 jin of fertilizer last year, enough to apply an average of 21 jin per mu to the commune's 78,000 mu of farmland.
    As I walked, I thought excitedly, "A commune with such a good fertilizer plant, its scale and equipment must be quite impressive." But when I arrived in Beiguan Village (where the fertilizer plant is located), I saw many jars and pots, large and small, scattered in piles. On the east side of the chemical workshop, a small donkey was pulling a mill to grind bone meal, and on the other side, several large iron pots were boiling brine. Everything was so rudimentary. The plant director, Wang Jingming, seemed to understand what I was thinking. He smiled and said to me, "It was even more primitive in the past!"
    It turned out that in 1958, when the agricultural great leap forward movement was in full swing, they encountered the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. The whole township needed 4.8 million dan of fertilizer, but at that time, there were only about 1 million dan of farmyard manure. What to do? The masses suggested making their own. Wang Jingming and fifteen other young members of the Communist Youth League, who were from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, actively signed up to build a plant to produce fertilizer. Of these fifteen people, only one had graduated from junior high school, three had attended higher primary school, and the rest were from primary school or were semi-literate. None of them had ever seen a fertilizer plant. They had only heard that the local fertilizer plant in Qingxu County had iron pots and water tanks. Wu Yong brought an iron sieve from his home, and Niu Jinyi also moved two large basins. To build the factory, Wang Jingming exchanged his three brick houses for others. He also spent eighty yuan to buy a hundred worn mats and thirty poles. He acted as his own carpenter and bricklayer, renovated the old houses, and built a thatched shed. In this way, the fertilizer plant was set up in the dilapidated courtyard. Wang Jingming became the director.
    The factory was very difficult at that time. The workers came with their luggage but didn't know what to produce. Later, Wang Jingming led his partners to the Shanxi Agricultural College to learn how to make bacterial fertilizer. People there used modern equipment to make bacterial fertilizer, and just buying a sterilizer would cost thousands of yuan. The few people felt discouraged and turned back. That night, Wang Jingming thought about the task assigned by the Party, and the fertilizer needed in the fields, and tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He thought, "If we can't build a large, modern one, can't we build a simple, local sterilizer?" Wang Jingming thought of this and jumped out of bed, threw on a thin shirt, and ran to Taigu City. He arrived at the Agricultural College at dawn and asked around. Professor Yu said, "A simple one can be made, it only costs a little over a hundred yuan to make a local sterilizer." He rushed back to encourage everyone to experiment. After six or seven failures, they finally succeeded and produced 150,000 jin of bacterial fertilizer in ten days. They became more and more daring in their thinking, and more and more daring in their work. They said, "Science! Even if you are a tiger, I will ride you!" Last April, they saw the mixing ratio of calcium arsenate in a book. Communist Youth League members Yang Limao and Wang Jingsheng asked to be assigned the task of testing calcium sulfate. However, due to a lack of chemical knowledge, they were poisoned during the experiment, their faces turned blue, and their noses swelled. Everyone advised them to rest, but they resolutely refused. After another five days, they finally succeeded.
    After much effort, they finally produced fertilizer. However, the masses were not yet accustomed to using fertilizer. They tried it and it didn't seem to make much of a difference, so they said, "Local fertilizer is white powder, black powder, when applied to the ground, it's all just powder." As a result, the fertilizer piled up and couldn't be sold, and some people's thoughts began to waver. At this critical moment, Comrade Mu Ziwen, the secretary of the township Party committee, personally came to the factory to explain the significance of making fertilizer for increasing agricultural production, and to study improvement methods with everyone. He told them to analyze the local soil, to appraise the quality of the products, and to investigate the needs of the masses. So, one evening in early summer of 1959, Yang Peifu, the secretary of the Youth League branch, and Wu Hongliang, an old worker, carried dry food and pesticides and went to the countryside. They ran through twenty management areas in eight days, soliciting opinions from the masses about the products. Wherever they went, they taught the masses the techniques of applying chemical fertilizers and publicized the advantages of using chemical fertilizers. In the Dongzhuang management area, the masses caught red spiders for on-the-spot testing. They sprinkled the pesticide lime sulfur mixture on the red spiders, and in less than two minutes, all the red spiders stretched out their legs. The masses praised, "Don't look down on this powder, it really makes a big difference." As a result, the fertilizer plant's reputation improved, and all the management areas rushed to the factory to haul fertilizer.
    In just half a year after the factory was built, the farmers, who had never even heard of chemical fertilizer, became multi-skilled workers who understood chemical properties and could build factories. Last June, in order to meet the needs of agricultural production, the commune Party committee asked them to produce pesticides such as "666" and "DDT" and other advanced chemical products. This meant they could no longer rely solely on a few iron pots and jars, but had to increase production equipment. From then on, the workers began to talk about machines. They sent people to Taiyuan to buy machines to produce "666" powder, but found that they were all made of steel and could not be bought for the time being. Yang Peifu, the secretary of the Youth League branch, said, "We must make modern things out of local materials." So, some went out to visit and learn, some researched at home, some drew diagrams, and some experimented. Old worker Zhang La'ai, led a group of young people to work hard for twenty days, and built two nitrogen dioxide towers and a large chimney 26.7 meters high, enabling the fertilizer workshop, which produced two tons of advanced nitrogen fertilizer per day, to produce normally. Technical innovation experts chased after each other, competing with each other. Wang Jingming changed the hand-cranked pulverizing mill for producing "666" powder into an electric mill, and soon after, he changed it into an electric grinder. Yang Limao changed the hand-shaking sieve into a wind sieve, increasing efficiency by two times. But the wind sieve generated too much wind, which could easily cause workers to be poisoned, so Wang Jingming changed it to a blower, increasing the daily output from two and a half tons to five tons. They learned, worked, produced, and improved simultaneously, boldly creating and constantly innovating. This March, Wang Jingming, Yang Limao, and Wu Hongliang, concentrated everyone's creativity, and based on the principles of electric compressors and scraping cyclones, combined everything into a complete set, turning the five processes of producing "666" powder into the factory's first automatic production line. Now, just press a button, and the raw materials are automatically sent into the electric mill, and then through conveyors and other processes, the "666" powder, which fully meets national standards, is automatically packed into paper bags, increasing the output by more than two and a half times.

    给土化肥厂扬个名
    本报记者　刘玉
    公社办的小土化肥厂能生产洋化肥吗？能，山西太谷县沙河公社青年红旗化肥厂，已经生产出了五十八种化肥、农药和化工原料。
    临近夏收的一天，记者来到红旗化肥厂访问。一路上来来往往拉化肥的马车不断。放眼望去，辽阔的田野，到处翻滚着金黄的麦浪。赶车的社员说：
  “沙河公社的麦子，又壮又高，功劳簿上真该给化肥厂扬个名。”他们告诉我，化肥厂去年产了一百六十八万多斤化肥，全公社的七万八千亩粮田，每亩平均可施用二十一斤。
    我一面走，一面兴奋地想：“一个公社，居然有这样好的化肥厂，它的规模和设备一定很可观了。”但是，到了北洸村（化肥厂所在地）一看，院子里放着许多缸缸罐罐，有大有小，东一堆，西一堆；化工车间的东边，一头小毛驴正在拉碾轧骨粉，另一边支着几口大铁锅正熬卤水。一切是如此的简陋。厂长王敬铭似乎了解我的心意，他笑着对我说，过去还要土哩！
    原来在1958年农业大生产运动搞得正热闹的时候，却遇到了肥料不足的困难。全乡需要肥料四百八十万担，而当时实有的农家肥料才一百来万担。怎么办呢？群众的意见是自己造。王敬铭等十五个贫农、下中农出身的共青团员，积极报名建厂造肥料。这十五个人，只有一个初中毕业生，三个上过高小，其余都是初小和半文盲。谁也没见过化肥厂。只听说过清徐县的土化肥厂有铁锅，水缸。武庸从他家里拿来一个铁筛子，牛金意也搬来了两个大水盆。为了建工厂，王敬铭把自己的三间砖瓦房换给了别人。又用八十块钱买了一百张破席子，三十根杆子。自己当木匠，自己当瓦匠，整修了一下旧房子，搭了个席棚，就这样，在破院子里办起了化肥厂。王敬铭当了厂长。
    那时工厂里很困难。工人们背着行李来了，还不知道生产什么。后来王敬铭带着伙伴们到山西农学院去学造细菌肥料。人家造细菌肥料是洋设备，光买个灭菌器，就得几千块钱。几个人心里凉了半截，扭头就返回来了。回来的这天晚上，王敬铭想着党交给的任务，想着农田里需要的肥料，翻来复去睡不着。他想：“搞不起大的洋的，不能搞个简单的土灭菌器吗？”王敬铭想到这里，一骨碌下了床，披了件单褂，就往太谷城里跑。天麻麻亮时赶到农学院，进去一打听，有位余教授说：“搞个简单的可以，有一百多元就能制个土灭菌器。他急着返回来，鼓励大家试验，经过六七次的失败，结果搞成功了，十天生产了细菌肥料十五万斤。他们越想越敢想，越干越敢干。他们说：“科学！你就是只老虎，我也要骑！”去年4月，他们在一本书上看到砒酸钙的配料比例，共青团员杨立茂和王敬生要求把试验硫酸钙的任务交给他俩。但是因为缺乏化学知识，试验中中了毒，脸发青了，鼻子也肿了。大家劝他俩休息，他们坚决不肯。又经过了五天，终于试成了。
    费了九牛二虎之力，总算把化肥生产出来了。但是，群众还没有用化肥的习惯，试了试又不顶大事，便说：“土化肥是白面面，黑面面，上到地里都是土面面。”结果肥料堆着卖不出去，有些人思想波动起来。正在这个节骨眼上，乡党委书记穆子文同志，亲自来到工厂里，给大家讲解造化肥对农业增产的意义，和大家一块研究改进办法。告诉他们要对当地土质进行分析，对产品质量要进行鉴定，对群众要求进行调查。于是，在1959年初夏的一个傍晚，团支部书记杨培福和老工人吴宏亮，带着干粮背着农药下乡了。他们八天跑了二十个管理区，广泛征求群众对产品的意见。走到那里，就当场给群众传授施用化学肥料的技术，宣传施用化学肥料的优越性。在东庄管理区的时候，群众捉来红蜘蛛当场试验，他们把农药石硫合剂撒在红蜘蛛的身边，没等两分钟，几只红蜘蛛就全部伸腿了。群众称赞说：“别看是面面，可真顶大事。”这样一来，化肥厂的信誉提高了，各管理区都争先恐后地来厂里拉肥料。
    建厂刚刚半年，原来连化学肥料的名字都没听说过的农民，成了既懂化学性能，又会建厂的多能工人。去年6月，为了适应农业生产的需要，公社党委向他们提出要生产“六六六”、“滴滴涕”等农药和其他高级化工产品。这就不能只靠几口铁锅和几个罐罐，必须增加生产设备，从此，工人们开始谈论起机器来。他们派人去太原买生产“六六六”粉的机器，一打听，都是钢材做的，一时买不起。团总支书记杨培福说：“我们要叫它土中出洋。”于是，出外参观的参观，在家研究的研究，绘图的绘图，试验的试验。老工人张拉爱，领着一伙年轻人经过二十天的苦干巧干，建成了两座二氧化氮塔和一座二十六点七米高的大烟筒，使日产两吨高级氮肥的化肥车间正常生产。技术革新能手一个撵一个，一个赛一个。王敬铭把生产“六六六”粉的手摇粉碎磨，改成了电动磨，不多久，又改成了电动碾。杨立茂把手搬箩改成风箩，效率提高了两倍。但改用风箩扬风太大，容易引起工人中毒，王敬铭又改用鼓风机，使日产量由两吨半提高到五吨。他们边学、边干、边生产、边改进，大胆创造，不断革新。今年3月，王敬铭、杨立茂和吴宏亮，集中了大家的创造，又根据电气压缩机和刮旋风的原理，成龙配套，把生产“六六六”粉的五道工序，改成了全厂第一条生产自动线。现在，只要把电钮一按，原料就自动送进电碾，再经过传送带等工序，完全合乎国家标准的“六六六”粉，就自动装进纸袋里，产量提高了两倍半以上。（附图片）
