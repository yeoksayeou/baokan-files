Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 13th: Liaoning Province, an important industrial base in China, under the guidance of the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, is determined to place the development of agriculture in a primary position. It aims to quickly strengthen leadership over agricultural production, vigorously mobilize industry and all sectors to support agriculture, accelerate agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, and focus on key agricultural production areas and the transformation of backward communes and teams, in order to promote a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in Liaoning's agricultural production.

Since the start of socialist construction in China, especially during the continuous great leap forward in recent years, Liaoning Province's industrial production has played the role of an industrial base supporting the whole country and supporting agricultural technical transformation. At the same time, the province's agriculture has also made great achievements. However, compared with advanced brother provinces and with the province's industrial development, Liaoning's agriculture is still backward. Various agricultural products cannot meet the needs of national economic development and the growing needs of the people, and grain and non-staple foods cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, changing the backward face of agriculture as soon as possible has become an important task for party organizations throughout Liaoning.

At the recent enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Party Committee studied the agricultural production situation and decided to further strengthen leadership over agriculture, continue to deepen the movement of all sectors to support agriculture, vigorously expand the planting of high-yield crops, vigorously prepare for the fundamental treatment of the Liao River, and vigorously transform backward communes, teams, and fields to accelerate the development of agricultural production. After the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, leadership over agriculture was strengthened from the province, cities, and counties to the communes.

Since last winter, the province has added more than 3,400 cadres to strengthen leadership positions in rural areas. Recently, another 100 key personnel equivalent to major county-level cadres and 1,000 equivalent to section-level cadres were transferred from factories and mines to strengthen the leadership of local county party committees and agricultural offices. Leading cadres at all levels also joined the front line of production with practical actions. Recently, insect pests and weed infestations have become widespread in Liaoning. All localities immediately organized manpower to carry out the fight against insect pests and weeds. Xiao Zuohan, Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, personally led cadres to the front line. The city mobilized 180,000 people every day to participate in insect extermination. According to statistics from Shenyang, Anshan, Jinzhou, and Yingkou, the cultivated area where insect pests have been basically eliminated has reached more than 3 million mu.

Vigorously preparing for the fundamental treatment of the Liao River, and striving to quickly realize drought and flood protection in the Liao River Plain, is a major measure taken by the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee to reverse the backward situation in agriculture. The Liao River Basin is a large plain in Liaoning, and its cultivated land and grain output account for half of the province's total. In order to strengthen leadership in this key area, the Provincial Party Committee sent a group of leading cadres headed by Zhang Zhengde, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, to the riverine areas to conduct surveys, planning, and other preparatory work. Cities and counties have also transferred cadres to strengthen the leadership of county party committees. At present, with the support of the PLA units stationed in Shenyang, the first phase of the Shenpan water conservancy and irrigation project has been completed ahead of schedule. The various medium-sized water conservancy projects along the river that were already under construction are being carried out intensively, striving to complete them before the flood season, in order to reduce the threat of the Liao River flooding this year and strive for a bumper grain harvest in the autumn.

In order to promote a substantial and balanced increase in agricultural production throughout the province, Liaoning has focused on expanding the planting of the three major high-yield crops (rice, corn, sorghum) and transforming backward communes and teams since the beginning of this year. This year, most areas of Liaoning experienced heavy spring rains and low temperatures, delaying rice transplanting. In order to achieve the plan of expanding rice planting, in June, leading cadres at all levels came to the front line, increased the allocation of labor, and promoted the use of more than 13,000 rice transplanters to rush transplant rice seedlings. At present, the sown area of the three major high-yield crops of rice, corn, and sorghum that has been completed throughout the province has increased by more than 3.36 million mu compared with last year.

There are 15% of backward communes and teams in the province, which have been slow to develop production due to long-term weak leadership. Since the beginning of this year, in order to enable the production of backward communes and teams to quickly catch up with the level of advanced communes and teams, the Provincial Party Committee has organized more than 17,000 cadres to go deep into backward communes and teams to eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses, specifically help improve the leadership of backward communes and teams, and mobilize the masses to work hard to develop production, so that the work in these areas has undergone a fundamental change. At present, about 90% of the backward teams in the province have been transformed, and the face of production has gradually changed.

To quickly change the backward situation in agriculture, it is necessary to accelerate the realization of agricultural technical transformation. Since the beginning of this year, the Provincial Party Committee has used ten large industrial cities as bases, and through the method of "factory-commune pairing, fixed-point contracting, and all-inclusive responsibility", launched a massive movement throughout the province for factories and mines to help agriculture achieve technical transformation. At present, this movement has developed into a national movement with industrial support for agriculture as the center and all sectors supporting agriculture, and has achieved great results. With the help of factories and mines, the newly built and expanded agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants of the rural people's communes throughout the province have mostly been put into production, and a rural machinery repair and assembly network has been initially formed in the province. Cities have also supported rural areas with a large number of wires, transformers, and small power station equipment. Factories have also helped communes train more than 9,000 various technical workers, and sent more than 7,000 technical workers to communes to provide technical guidance - producing, inspecting, and teaching technology at the same time. The transportation department has also made significant achievements in rushing to transport materials and equipment needed for agricultural production. The financial and trade system has basically guaranteed the supply of materials needed for agricultural production. The cultural, educational, and health systems have also vigorously supported agriculture from material equipment, technology, culture, and science, according to the characteristics of their respective units. Local garrisons have also made great contributions in supporting the agricultural movement.

At present, all parts of the province are responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call for "five搶 and one防" (搶铲趟 - rush to hoe and loosen soil, 搶插秧 - rush to transplant rice seedlings, 搶种晚秋作物 - rush to plant late autumn crops, 搶移苗补种 - rush to transplant seedlings and replant, 搶基肥追肥 - rush to apply base fertilizer and top dressing, 防治自然灾害 - prevent and control natural disasters), seizing the opportunity, concentrating superior forces, and doing everything possible to manage summer fields well and actively prepare for summer harvest and summer planting. Many areas have put 70% to 80% of their labor force into the front line of production. The management of summer fields throughout the province is at the peak of the second hoeing, and areas with faster progress have begun to hoe for the third time, and more than 7 million mu of summer fields have been top-dressed once. Great progress has also been made in rushing to plant late autumn crops, eliminating wasteland, and transplanting seedlings and replanting. This year, more than 200,000 hectares of new wasteland have been reclaimed in the province, and more than 190,000 hectares have been rushed to plant. (Picture attached)

　　辽宁切实加强领导加速发展农业
　　扩种高产作物改造落后社队
　　大批干部充实各级领导岗位各行各业大力支援农业技术改造
    本报沈阳13日电　我国重要工业基地辽宁省各级党组织，在农业是国民经济基础的思想指导下，决心把发展农业放在首要地位，迅速加强对农业生产的领导，大力发动工业和各行各业支援农业，加速农业机械化和半机械化，大抓农业生产重点地区和改造落后社、队，以促使辽宁农业生产全面持续跃进。
    在我国开始社会主义建设以来，特别是连年持续大跃进过程中，辽宁省的工业生产发挥了工业基地支援全国、支援农业技术改造的作用；与此同时，全省农业也取得了很大的成就。但是，辽宁省的农业和先进的兄弟省份比较，和本省的工业发展相比较，还是落后的，各种农产品还不能适应国民经济发展和人民生活日益增长的需要，粮食和副食品还不能自给。因此，尽快地改变农业落后的面貌，就成为辽宁全省党组织的一个重要任务。
    在最近召开的中共辽宁省委常委扩大会上，省委研究了农业生产情况，确定进一步加强对农业的领导，继续深入开展各行各业支援农业的运动，大抓扩种高产作物，大抓根治辽河的准备工作，以及大抓改造落后社、队、田等措施，来加速农业生产的发展。省委常委扩大会议以后，从省、市、县到公社都加强了对农业的领导。
    从去冬以来，全省已加派三千四百多名干部充实农村领导岗位，最近，又从厂矿企业抽调一百名相当于主要县级干部、一千名相当于科级干部的骨干队伍，分别加强各地县委和农业办公室的领导，各级领导干部并以实际行动投入了生产第一线。最近期间，辽宁普遍发生虫害和草荒，各地立即组织人力进行了灭虫和除草的斗争。中共沈阳市委萧佐汉书记等人亲率干部上前线，全市每天出动参加灭虫的有十八万人。据沈阳、鞍山、锦州和营口等四个市的统计，目前基本扑灭虫害的耕地面积已达三百多万亩。
    大抓根治辽河的准备工作，争取迅速实现辽河平原旱涝保收，是中共辽宁省委扭转农业落后局面的一项重大措施。辽河流域是辽宁较大平原，耕地和粮食产量都占全省的一半。省委为了加强这个重点地区的领导，派出以省委委员、副省长张正德为首的一批领导干部，亲赴沿河地区进行考察规划等各项准备工作，各市、县也已抽出干部充实县委领导。目前，在解放军驻沈阳部队的支援下，沈盘水利灌溉工程第一批工程已经提前竣工。原已施工的沿河各个中型水利工程正在紧张进行，力争汛前完成，以减少今年辽河水患的威胁，争取秋季粮食大丰收。
    为了促进全省农业生产大幅度平衡增长，今年以来，辽宁各地突出地抓了扩种三大高产作物（水稻、玉米、高粱）和改造落后社、队的工作。今年辽宁大部地区春雨多、气温低，水稻插秧拖迟。为了实现扩种水稻的计划，6月间，各级领导干部亲临前线，增调劳力，推广使用了一万三千多台插秧机，抢插稻秧。目前全省已完成的水稻、玉米、高粱三大高产作物的播种面积，已比去年增多三百三十六万亩。
    全省有15％的落后社、队，由于长期领导薄弱，生产发展缓慢。今年以来，省委为了使落后社、队的生产迅速赶上先进社、队的水平，共组织了一万七千多名干部深入落后社、队，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，具体帮助改进落后社、队的领导，发动群众努力发展生产，使这些地区的工作有了根本的转变。目前，全省的落后队已有90％左右进行了改造，生产面貌逐渐改观。
  迅速改变农业落后局面，需要加速实现农业技术改造。今年年初以来，省委以十个大工业城市为基地，通过“厂社挂钩，定点包干，一包到底”的办法，发动全省厂矿企业开展了声势浩大的帮助农业实现技术改造的运动。目前这一运动已发展到以工业支援农业为中心、各行各业支援农业的全民性运动，并已取得巨大成绩。在各厂矿企业的帮助下，全省农村人民公社新建和扩建的农业机械修配厂已大部投入生产，在全省初步形成了农村机械修配网。各城市还支援了农村大批电线、变压器和小型发电站设备。工厂还帮助公社培养了各种技术工人九千多名，并派出七千多名技术工人到公社作技术指导——边生产、边检修、边教技术。交通运输部门在抢运农业需要的物资器材方面也作出了显著成绩。财贸系统基本上保证了农业生产所需要的物资供应。文教卫生系统，也分别根据本单位的特长，从物资设备、技术、文化、科学等方面，大力支援农业。各地驻军在支援农业运动中也贡献了很大的力量。
    目前，全省各地响应省委提出的“五抢一防”（抢铲趟、抢插秧、抢种晚秋作物、抢移苗补种、抢基肥追肥、防治自然灾害）的战斗号召，抓紧时机，集中优势兵力，千方百计搞好夏田管理，积极作好夏收夏种的准备工作。许多地区都以70％到80％的劳动力投入生产第一线。全省夏田管理正处在二遍铲趟的高潮，进展较快的地区已开始铲三遍，有七百多万亩夏田已追了一遍肥。抢种晚秋作物、消灭撩荒地、移苗补苗工作，也都获得很大进展。全省今年新开的二十多万公顷荒地，已抢种十九万多公顷。（附图片）
