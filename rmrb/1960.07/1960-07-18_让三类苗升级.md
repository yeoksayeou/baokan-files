　　Let Third-Class Seedlings Be Upgraded
    This year, the first weeding of autumn crops in our Jiangtun Commune was completed half a month earlier than in previous years, and the seedlings are growing very strongly. Some commune members believe that a good harvest is assured, and they are somewhat lax about the second weeding. After discovering this situation, the Party Committee immediately organized a general survey of the fields and seedlings. Through the survey, it was found that the commune still had more than 22,000 mu of third-class seedlings. Each of these third-class seedling fields was registered and marked. This method proved to be effective, and all production teams began to pay attention to this matter. The Party Branch Secretary of the Lihua Production Brigade personally took charge, organizing 200 laborers, 10 sets of weeding machines, and 100 plows, and spent five days weeding the 4,500 mu of second- and third-class seedlings, also applying more than 300 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu, promoting the transformation of weak seedlings into strong seedlings. Now, 90% of the 12,500 hectares of cultivated land in the entire commune has been weeded twice.

　　让三类苗升级
    今年，我们姜屯公社的秋田比往年提前半个月的时间就铲趟完了头遍，禾苗长得很茁壮。有的社员认为丰收有了把握，对锄二遍就有些放松。党委发现这种情况后，立即组织了田苗大普查。通过普查发现全公社还有二万二千多亩三类苗。对这些三类苗田每块都作了登记，插了标志。这办法果然有效，各个生产队都对这事重视起来了。历家生产大队总支书记亲自挂帅，组织了二百名劳力，十付铲趟机，一百付犁杖，用五天时间把四千五百多亩二、三类苗铲趟了一遍，每亩地还增施追肥三百多斤，促使弱苗转为壮苗。现在全公社有一万二千五百垧耕地，已有90％铲趟过二遍。
