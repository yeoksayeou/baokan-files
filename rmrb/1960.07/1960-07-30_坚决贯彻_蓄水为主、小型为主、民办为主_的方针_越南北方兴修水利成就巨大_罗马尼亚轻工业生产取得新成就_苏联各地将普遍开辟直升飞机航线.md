    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 26th: The people of North Vietnam, adhering to the Labor Party's water management policy of "water storage first, small-scale first, people-run first," continued to vigorously develop water conservancy projects in the first half of this year, achieving great success.
    According to the recent North Vietnam Water Conservancy Work Conference held in Ninh Binh Province, the people in the plains, midstream areas, and some mountainous provinces contributed more than 5.6 million workdays to water conservancy construction in the first half of this year, completing more than 7.7 million cubic meters of earthwork, almost equal to the total earthwork completed in the entire year of 1959.
    As a result of vigorously developing water conservancy, the drought this year was greatly reduced. Since last winter, North Vietnam has experienced a rare drought lasting eight to nine months, but the drought-affected area has been greatly reduced compared to previous years.
    Currently, in order to ensure a comprehensive, high-yield, and stable harvest of the late rice crop, the people of North Vietnam are launching a large-scale water conservancy construction campaign. In Yi'an Province alone, more than 100 townships have completed 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork in the past ten days, equivalent to all the earthwork they completed in the first four months of this year. Among them, Ying Shan County alone excavated 210,000 cubic meters of earth and stone in ten days.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 27th: Some light industrial sectors in Romania have achieved new successes this year. In the first five months of this year, they have overproduced 2 million square meters of textiles and 5,400 tons of sugar, saving 160 million lei (Romanian currency).
    In the past two years, the development of Romania's light industry has been very rapid. The annual growth rate reached 11.5%, and the product cost reduction rate was 2.5%, which means that 480 million lei can be saved annually.
    One of the reasons for these achievements is the extensive implementation of technological innovations and the promotion of advanced operations and technological processes. In the first half of this year alone, enterprises in the light industrial sector put forward 8,073 innovation proposals, 33% more than in the same period in 1959.
    These achievements in the light industrial sector have enabled the Romanian Workers' Party and the government to recently make the decision to reduce the retail prices of 1,000 commodities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: The Soviet Union is increasingly using light and flexible means of transportation—helicopters—in domestic air transportation. This year, approximately 200 new helicopter routes will be opened in various Soviet republics, with comfortable "Mi-4" helicopters capable of carrying ten to eleven people each.
    In the next few months, more than 100 helicopter routes will begin regular flights in various parts of the Soviet Union. Recently, a helicopter route was established in the Azerbaijan Republic from Baku to offshore oil fields, and a total of eight such routes will be newly opened in the republic this year. Helicopter routes have also been established in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and other republics. In the Far East, it is planned to establish 20 helicopter routes, totaling 3,000 kilometers in length. In the future, people will be able to take a helicopter directly from Khabarovsk to the famous "Komsomolsk-on-Amur" on the Amur River (Heilongjiang).
    In Eastern Siberia, 39 helicopter routes will be opened. Helicopters do not require special large airports and runways, and are convenient for take-off and landing. After the establishment of these routes, helicopters will connect the constantly emerging new settlements and cities, industrial centers and mines of Eastern Siberia. At that time, the currently inconvenient forest areas and tundra areas of Eastern Siberia will also be connected to other regions.
    Helicopter aviation will also be developed in various resort areas of the Soviet Union. Currently, twenty helicopter landing sites are being built in the resort areas of Crimea. Helicopters will transport tourists directly to many scenic resorts.

    坚决贯彻“蓄水为主、小型为主、民办为主”的方针
    越南北方兴修水利成就巨大
    罗马尼亚轻工业生产取得新成就　苏联各地将普遍开辟直升飞机航线
    新华社河内26日电　越南北方人民根据劳动党的“蓄水为主、小型为主、民办为主”的治水方针，今年上半年继续大办水利，并且取得了巨大的成就。
    据最近在宁平省召开的全北方水利工作会议宣布，在平原、中游地区和山区一些省的人民，今年上半年在修建水利工程方面共做了五百六十多万个劳动日，完成了七百七十多万土方，几乎等于1959年全年完成土方的总和。
    大办水利的结果，今年的旱灾大为减轻。去冬以来北方出现了多年来少有的延续八、九个月之久的干旱，但受旱面积比往年大大缩小。
    目前，越南北方各地人民为确保晚造获得全面、高额、稳当的丰收，正在掀起大规模的兴修水利的运动。宜安省仅在最近十天中，就有一百多个乡完成了三十万土方，相当于今年头四个月中他们所完成的全部土方的总和。其中仅英山县在十天中就挖筑了二十一万土石方。
    新华社布加勒斯特27日电　罗马尼亚有些轻工业部门今年以来取得了新的成就。在今年的头五个月中，已经超计划生产了二百万平方米的纺织品和五千四百吨糖，节约达一亿六千万列伊（罗币）。
    近两年来，罗马尼亚轻工业的发展是很迅速的。每年增长率达到11.5％，产品成本的下降率是2.5％，这意味着每年可以节约四亿八千万列伊。
    取得这些成就的原因之一是广泛地进行了技术革新和推广先进的操作和工艺过程。单在今年上半年，轻工业部门的企业提出的革新建议就达八千零七十三条，比1959年同期多33％。
    轻工业部门取得的这些成就，使得罗马尼亚工人党和政府能在最近作出降低一千种商品零售价格的决定。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联在国内航空运输中，越来越多地使用轻便、灵巧的交通工具——直升飞机。今年，在苏联各加盟共和国将新开辟大约二百条使用直升飞机的航线，在这些航线上将飞行每架能容纳十到十一人的舒适的“米一四型”直升飞机。
    在最近几个月内，苏联各地就将有一百多条直升飞机航线开始经常性的航行。不久前，在阿塞拜疆共和国建立了从巴库到海上采油场的直升飞机航线，总计共和国在今年将新辟八条这样的航线。在乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼、哈萨克等共和国也建立了直升飞机航线。在远东地区，计划建立二十条直升飞机航线，共长三千公里。将来，人们将可以从伯力市乘直升飞机直达阿穆尔河（黑龙江）上著名的“共青团城”。
    在东西伯利亚，将开辟三十九条直升飞机航线。直升飞机不需要专门的大机场和跑道，起飞和降落都很便利。在建立了这种航线以后，直升飞机就可以把东西伯利亚不断兴起的新的居民点和城市、工业中心和矿山联接起来。那时候，东西伯利亚目前交通不便的森林地带和冻土地带也将同其他地区畅通起来。
    在苏联各疗养地区，也将发展直升飞机航空事业。现在，在克里米亚的疗养地区正在建设二十个直升飞机降落场所。直升飞机将把游人直接运到许多景色宜人的休养胜地。
