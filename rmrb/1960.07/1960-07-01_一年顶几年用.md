    One Year's Work Equaling Several Years'
    Niè Zōngqìng, Worker Engineer, Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory

    Time marches relentlessly forward, and our leaping strides surge ahead even faster. Although time flies, with half the year already gone, our progress is even more rapid. In our work section, we have already comprehensively completed eleven months' worth of production tasks and are now striding towards the great goal of completing two years' worth of tasks in one year.

    The main reason we have been able to leap forward so quickly is the result of vigorously engaging in the technical revolution. Working as a forging worker is a labor-intensive job. At the beginning of the year, most of the comrades in our work section were doing manual labor, toiling away all day long, quite tired, and not achieving much; the forgings sent by brother workshops for processing piled up and could never be delivered on time. The Party Committee called on us to vigorously engage in the technical revolution, to realize the mechanization of forging, and to put down the hammer. The Party Committee's call was truly powerful, mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm. I and some veteran workers did the design, and everyone squeezed out time to pick up waste materials and do the manufacturing. In just over two months, we made two spring hammers, one shoulder-pole hammer, and more than ten types of special equipment. The labor intensity was reduced, and the efficiency was increased by one to seventy times. Later, we were determined to simply "divorce" from the hammer and fully realize mechanization and semi-mechanization. With greater determination, there were more and faster innovations. Within half a year, we achieved more than 140 major innovations, making most of the production process mechanized, and many places automated. We not only improved the production equipment, but also improved the cooling and heat prevention equipment, changed the production environment, and turned hot and tiring places into places for happy labor. Therefore, the production tasks were completed ahead of schedule, the number of personnel was reduced by one-third, and the cost was reduced by nearly half, achieving an all-round leap forward. In the second half of the year, in order to realize the doubling of our factory's production, we decided to change the current heating furnace to an electric furnace, the forging hammer to electric control, and realize the electrification of transportation. In short, from pig iron entering the furnace to finished products entering the warehouse, we want to realize automation and semi-automation.

    This plan has now become everyone's action program. The seven veteran masters in our work section have formed a "Zhuge Liang" group, dividing the innovation tasks for the second half of the year into thirteen major projects, with each person specifically assigned to be responsible for one or two items. I am an old worker who has been beside the baking oven for more than 30 years. This year, the leadership promoted me to engineer and also made me the head of the forging work section in the forging workshop. I will resolutely rely on the Party and rely on the masses to ensure the timely realization of innovation projects and ensure a greater leap forward in the second half of the year. By then, our work section will be greatly changed, and it will be like the workers envisioned: "No one is seen beside the heating furnace, forgings are processed by pressing the electric button, production indicators soar into the sky, and one year's work is done in several years."

    一年顶几年用
    郑州纺织机械厂工人工程师  聂宗庆
    时间一个劲儿往前奔，我们跃进的步子也一个劲儿往前迈。虽说时间跑得很快，今年已过去了一半，可是我们跃进得更快。以我们工段来说，如今已经全面完成了十一个月的生产任务，现在正大踏步地向一年完成两年任务的伟大目标迈进。
    我们所以能够跃进这么快，主要是大闹技术革命的结果。干锻工这活儿、是掐力气的活。年初，我们工段绝大部分同志都是手工劳动，成天叮当叮当，累得可不轻，成绩却不大；兄弟车间送来加工的锻件，一堆一堆地积压起来，总是不能按时交货。党委号召我们大搞技术革命，实现锻造机械化，放下鎯头把。党委的号召真有力量，调动了大家的积极性。我和一些老工人搞了设计，大伙就挤时间拣废料，搞制造，在两个多月的时间内，就制成了两台弹簧锤、一台扁担锤和十多种专用设备，劳动强度减轻了，效率提高了一倍到七十多倍。后来，我们下定决心，干脆和鎯头“离婚”，全面实现机械化半机械化。决心大了，革新也就多了、快了，在半年的时间内，我们就实现了一百四十多项较重大的革新，使生产过程绝大部分实现了机械化，很多地方实现了自动化。我们不仅改进了生产设备，还改进了防暑降温设备，改变了生产环境，把又热又累的地方，变成了愉快劳动的场合了。因此生产任务提前完成，人员减少了三分之一，成本降低了将近一半，实现了全面跃进。下半年，为了实现我厂生产翻番，我们决定再把现在的加热炉改为电气炉，锻锤改为电气控制，实现运输电气化。总之，从生铁入炉，到成品入库，要实现自动化半自动化。
    这个计划现在已经成了大伙的行动纲领，我们工段的七个老师傅已经组成了
  “诸葛亮”小组，把下半年的革新任务，划分为十三个大项目，每人具体分工负责一项到两项。我是在烘炉旁待了三十多年的老工人，今年领导上又提拔我为工程师，还兼任锻压车间锻工工段长，我要坚决依靠党，依靠群众，保证定期实现革新项目，保证下半年更大跃进，到那时，我们工段就会大变样，就会像工人所设想的
  “加热炉旁不见人，加工锻件按电门，生产指标突长空，一年当做几年用”。
