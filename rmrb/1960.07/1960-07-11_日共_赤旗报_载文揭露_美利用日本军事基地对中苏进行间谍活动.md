Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 10th: The Japanese "Akahata" published an article today exposing the US's crimes of using its military bases in Japan to conduct espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union.

The article stated that the US Air Force's newspaper for its personnel in Japan reported the "glorious deeds" of Captain Cove of the 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the US Air Force stationed at Yokota Base, who had been intruding into the airspace of China and the Soviet Union since 1956 in a Douglas RB-66 aircraft to "conduct photographic reconnaissance work."

The article pointed out that, in addition to this type of reconnaissance aircraft, Martin RB-57D aircraft are also stationed at Yokota US military base. This type of aircraft, like the U-2 aircraft, can fly for a considerable period of time at high altitude with the engine turned off to carry out espionage activities.

The article also revealed that the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron of the US Air Force stationed at Misawa Base possesses McDonnell RF-101C reconnaissance aircraft; the US Navy's Martin Mercator reconnaissance aircraft are stationed at Iwakuni Base, and this type of aircraft intruded into China's airspace in May 1958.

"Akahata" pointed out that, in addition, it is worth noting that Boeing RB-47H jet aircraft have been stationed at Japanese bases. This type of aircraft belongs to the US Strategic Air Command, and it was only recently that the US Air Force authorities revealed that it has this type of aircraft.

"Akahata" also revealed that the US military also uses communication bases set up in Hokkaido and Fukuoka, Kyushu, to eavesdrop on Chinese and Soviet radio waves.

"Akahata" said that the US military communication base in Chitose, Hokkaido, has two hundred and several dozen radio towers and is fully equipped. The US military units stationed there belong to a special intelligence unit of the US Department of Defense's National Security Agency.

　　美利用日本军事基地对中苏进行间谍活动
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”今天发表文章，揭露美国利用它在日本的军事基地对中苏两国进行间谍活动的罪行。
    文章说，驻日美国空军的机关报报道了驻在横田基地的美国空军第十二战术侦察中队的科夫上尉从1956年以来驾驶道格拉斯RB—66型飞机窜入中苏两国领空“进行摄影侦探工作”的“辉煌事迹”。
    文章指出：在横田美军基地，除了这种侦察机以外，还驻有马丁RB—57D型飞机。这种飞机同U—2型飞机一样，能够在高空停止发动机的条件下飞翔相当长的时间，来进行间谍活动。
    文章还揭露，驻在三泽基地的美国空军第四十五侦察中队拥有马克达尼尔RF—101C型侦察机；在岩国基地驻有美国海军的马丁·默克特侦察机，这种飞机曾经在1958年5月侵犯过中国的领空。
    “赤旗报”指出，此外，值得注意的是，日本基地已经驻有波音RB—47H型喷气式飞机。这种飞机属于美国战略空军，并且直到最近美国空军当局才透露它有这种飞机。
    “赤旗报”还揭露，美军还利用设在北海道和九州福冈的通讯基地盗听中苏的电波。
    “赤旗报”说，北海道千岁美军通讯基地设有二百几十座无线电讯塔，设备齐全。驻在那里的美军部队属于美国国防部全国安全署的专门搞情报活动的特务部队。
