　　Introduction to Performances by Two Soviet Musicians
　　Lǐ Líng
    Soviet pianist T. Nikolayeva and violinist Z. Shikhmurzaeva gave two outstanding concerts in the capital on the 16th and 17th. The first concert featured their solo performances, and the second featured them performing Tchaikovsky's *Piano Concerto in D Major* and *Violin Concerto* with the Central Philharmonic Orchestra. Their successful performances were highly praised by the audience.

    T. Nikolayeva is a pianist and composer who has written many excellent works. Her piano concerto is one of the retained programs of our radio station. At the first concert, she also played her own *Three Études* and *Two Children's Pieces*. Even in these few short pieces, we can see her creative talent.

    She is a famous Soviet pianist and a multiple winner of international competitions. Her performances are earnest, enthusiastic, rigorous, and solid. Her interpretation of Beethoven's *Appassionata Sonata* is profound and comprehensive. Her unique, powerful, and charming piano tone is quite fitting in embodying Beethoven's emotionally charged work.

    She also has unique insights into Liszt's music. She presented the composer's gorgeous, fiery, and varied *Hungarian Rhapsody* so vividly and convincingly that it is indeed rare.

    The effort she put into Tchaikovsky's *Piano Concerto* is particularly touching. Her pursuit of the original work's emotions is sincere and profound. She is very faithful to the composer's requirements, striving to express every detail, even the subtle clef signs on the score, as realistically as possible.

    Some Western pianists' recordings reveal a tendency to emphasize the brilliant parts of the piece while neglecting the lyrical and singing qualities. However, T. Nikolayeva, on the one hand, prominently expresses the solemn and heroic temperament of the piece, and on the other hand, strives to give full play to the singing and lyrical qualities of the music.

    What is most admirable about her performance is that, as a female pianist, she can express the magnificent, splendid, enthusiastic, and unrestrained emotions of this concerto so excellently, with such skilled technique, detailed and meticulous phrasing, and with such astonishing power. This is not often seen.

    Z. Shikhmurzaeva is a young and talented violinist. She played Mendelssohn's *Violin Concerto in E Major* and Tchaikovsky's *Violin Concerto*. Obviously, her sculpting of Tchaikovsky's music, both in style and sentiment, is much more mature than her handling of Mendelssohn's concerto.

    Like T. Nikolayeva, she strives for meticulousness in Tchaikovsky's works. Some musicians often cut out certain passages when performing this concerto, but Z. Shikhmurzaeva completely preserves every part of the piece and is good at handling various changes in timbre. Her tone is beautiful and very expressive.

    I especially like her performance of Tchaikovsky's *Melody*, which is so soft and beautiful, just like an outstanding singer pouring out her song so genuinely and movingly.

    We have heard the musical artistry of Soviet violinists Oistrakh and Kogan, who are world-renowned and the pride of the Soviet people. Now, we see that the younger generation of Soviet musical artists also possesses excellent cultivation and artistic talent. As musical friends of the Soviet Union, this is particularly gratifying to us.

    Let us congratulate these two musicians on their greater success in their performances in China.

　　介绍两位苏联音乐家的演奏
　　李凌
    苏联钢琴家塔·尼古拉耶娃和小提琴家佐·施赫木尔扎耶娃于16、17日在首都举行了两场出色的音乐会。第一天的音乐会是她们两人的独奏，第二天是由中央乐团协奏演出了柴可夫斯基的《Ｄ大调钢琴协奏曲》和《小提琴协奏曲》。她们成功的表演，获得听众极高的评价。
    塔·尼古拉耶娃是钢琴家兼作曲家，她曾写作过许多优秀的作品，她的钢琴协奏曲，是我国广播电台的保留节目之一。在第一天的音乐会上，她也弹奏了她自己的《三首练习曲》和《两首儿童小曲》。就在这几首简短的小曲里，我们也可以看到她的创作才华。
    她是苏联著名的钢琴家，也是国际比赛多次获奖者。她的表演认真、热情，严格、结实。她对贝多芬的《热情奏鸣曲》的解释，深刻而周详，她那特有的刚劲而富有魅力的琴音，在体现贝多芬这首情感充沛的作品上，是相当到家的。
    她对李斯特的音乐，也有她独到的见解，她把作者这首华丽的、火热的而富变化的《匈牙利狂想曲》表现得如此生动，有说服力，的确少见。
    她在柴可夫斯基的《钢琴协奏曲》中所费的心思，特别使人感动。她对原作的情感的追求，是真挚、深刻的，她非常忠实于作者的要求，即使是每一个细节，甚至是乐谱上细微的谱号，都尽力求其如实表现出来。
    有些西方的钢琴家的录音唱片，听得出来是每每为了强调这首乐曲的光彩部分，而对其中抒情性，歌唱性忽略过去，但是塔·尼古拉耶娃，一方面突出地表现了这首乐曲的庄严、豪迈的气质，而又尽力使音乐的歌唱性、抒情性得到充分的发挥。
    她的演奏，最使人钦佩的是，作为一个女钢琴家，能够把这首协奏曲的雄伟、壮丽、热烈、奔放的情调，表现得如此出色，如此技巧老练、句法细致、缜密而又带有如此令人惊异的魄力，这是不易多见的。
    佐·施赫木尔扎耶娃是一位年青而有才能的小提琴家。她演奏了门德尔松的《Ｅ大调协奏曲》和柴可夫斯基的《小提琴协奏曲》。显然，她对柴可夫斯基的音乐的雕塑，不管在风格上，情趣上，要比对门德尔松的协奏曲成熟得多。
    她对柴可夫斯基的作品，和塔·尼古拉耶娃一样，是力求一丝不苟。有些音乐家表演这首协奏曲，常常把其中某些乐节删节去了，而佐·施赫木尔扎耶娃，却完整地保存乐曲的每一个部分，并且善于处理各种各样的音色的变化。她的音色很美，非常善于表情。
    我很喜欢她演奏的柴可夫斯基的《旋律》，是那么柔和而秀丽，正像一位卓越的歌者，用她的歌音倾诉出来那样真切、动人。
    我们听过苏联闻名世界的小提琴家奥依斯特拉、柯岗等人的音乐艺术，那是苏联人民的骄傲。现在，我们又看到年青的一代的苏联音乐艺术家同样具有极好的修养和艺术才华。作为苏联的音乐朋友，这是特别使我们感到喜悦的。
    让我们祝贺这两位音乐家在中国的演出获得更大的成就。
