Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 10th: West German workers have been demonstrating for days in the city of Hildesheim and the nearby town of Nordhoff in Lower Saxony to protest against the "German Reich Party," an organization of former Nazis, holding a congress in the city.

According to the West German Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the "German Reich Party" members intended to hold a public rally in Hildesheim on the evening of the 8th as a prelude to the fascist organization's congress. This news aroused the anger of West German workers. More than 5,000 workers flocked to Hildesheim from all over Lower Saxony on the 8th and occupied the venue where the fascists planned to hold the rally, preventing it from taking place. The workers also condemned the authorities for allowing the fascists to hold the rally.

However, when the "German Reich Party" held its congress in Nordhoff near Hildesheim on the 9th and 10th, the Hildesheim city authorities actually sent armed police to protect it. These police also threatened the more than 500 workers demonstrating in front of the venue, saying that they would shoot the workers if necessary. But the workers were not intimidated. They shouted: "Drive out the Nazis!" and angrily tore down the fascists' signs outside the venue.

    新华社波恩10日电　西德工人连日在下萨克森州的希尔德赛姆市和附近的诺霍夫镇举行示威，抗议前纳粹分子的组织“德意志帝国党”在这个城市举行代表大会。
    据西德德意志新闻社报道，“德意志帝国党”的党徒打算在8日晚在希尔德赛姆举行公开的集会作为这个法西斯组织的代表大会的序幕。这一消息激起了西德工人的愤怒。五千多名工人在8日纷纷从下萨克森州各地到达希尔德赛姆，并且占领了法西斯分子预定举行集会的会场，制止了这次集会。工人们并且谴责当局准许法西斯分子举行集会。
    但是，当“德意志帝国党”9日和10日在希尔德赛姆市附近的诺霍夫举行代表大会时，希尔德赛姆市当局竟派遣武装警察前去保护。这些警察并且威胁在会场前面举行示威的五百多名工人说必要时就要向工人们开枪。但是工人们没有被吓倒，他们高呼：“赶走纳粹分子！”并且愤怒地撕下了会场门外法西斯分子的标语牌。
