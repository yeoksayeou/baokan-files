Investigate Actions and See Results, Investigate Problems and Increase Measures
Yongning County Committee of Tianshui Prefecture Inspects the Implementation of the "Two-Five System"

(Our newspaper reports) The Tianshui Prefecture of Gansu Province, based on inspecting and summarizing the implementation of the "Two-Five System," and in conjunction with local conditions and characteristics, has further formulated specific methods and measures and has begun to universally implement the "Three-Seven System" leadership method.

Before the beginning of July, the eight counties (cities) and one hundred and twenty-seven people's communes in Tianshui Prefecture had universally promoted the "Two-Five System" and "Fifty System" according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees on improving leadership methods and raising leadership levels. Judging from the implementation, this leadership method has played a significant role in improving leadership style, improving work methods, and promoting current production, and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.

The benefits of promoting the "Two-Five System" are mainly reflected in: First, the number of cadres who go deep into the forefront of production and participate in and lead production has increased sharply. After the cadres participated in production, they stimulated the labor enthusiasm of production team cadres and the broad masses. At the same time, because leading cadres participated in production and led production, many specific problems in production were resolved, which greatly promoted current production. Second, grassroots leadership has been strengthened. The vast majority of cadres who have gone deep into the forefront of production in the entire region have gone deep into remote mountainous areas, backward communes, and backward production teams, contracted to communes, teams, and crops to thoroughly change the backward situation and promote the balanced development of various tasks. Third, the situation of the county, commune, and brigade leading organs "squatting above and floating on the surface" in the past has been initially reversed. The vast number of cadres, as ordinary laborers, have gone deep into reality, deep into the masses, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, making intimate friends with the peasants, and further closing the relationship between leading cadres and grassroots cadres, and between cadres and the masses. At the same time, because cadres go deep down, problems are discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Fourth, it ensures that cadres have a fixed time to study the Party's policies and theories.

The Tianshui Prefectural Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee to inspect and summarize the situation in this stage and conduct special research and discussion on the issue of further implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method. The meeting decided: First, according to the characteristics of Tianshui area, where communes are generally large, residences are relatively dispersed, and concentration is not convenient, and the experience of promoting the "Two-Five System" in the previous stage, the entire region, counties, communes, and brigades will now uniformly promote the "Three-Seven System." That is, in the first three days of each ten-day period, study and hold meetings to research and arrange work, and in the last seven days, go deep into the forefront of production, participate in production, lead production, and help the grassroots solve problems. Alignment up and down, unified time. During the three days of centralized study and deployment of work, it is necessary to ensure one day of study time. After the universal implementation of the "Three-Seven System," county and commune party committees and prefectural organs should retain a fixed number of personnel to handle organ work, be responsible for multi-party liaison, and grasp the overall situation. Second, in promoting the "Three-Seven System" at all levels, according to the specific circumstances and the central issues that need to be discussed, the county and commune party committees and brigade general branches should arrange the concentration points, participants, and discussion topics in advance and notify the relevant personnel in advance. In addition to special studies, cadres are generally concentrated in communes and teams to study and inspect the deployment of work. Third, cadres working in communes and production teams in county and commune-level organs should be concentrated in the county once a month to participate in "Three-Seven System" activities to summarize, study, and arrange the work of their departments. Fourth, cadres who go to production teams and production squads at the county, commune, and brigade levels should help the grassroots party organizations establish a regular organizational life system, with a general meeting of party members once a month, a branch committee meeting once every ten days, and a group meeting once every half month. Help grassroots party members and cadres study the Party's guidelines and policies or regulations on rural work, rectify county and commune party schools, train cadres on a planned basis, and improve the training of cadres. Fifth, all cadres who go to work in the countryside must eat in the commune members' canteens with tickets and actively participate in running public canteens well. Sixth, rural non-detached branch secretaries should participate in "Three-Seven System" activities with brigade cadres, for two days every ten days, one day for study and one day for arranging work.

Currently, the decision of the Prefectural Party Committee has been universally conveyed to the counties. Many leading cadres of county and commune party committees and brigade general branches have expressed that, on the basis of the original promotion of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, they will advance victoriously and resolutely implement the Prefectural Party Committee's decision on implementing the "Three-Seven System." Some county communes have begun to implement it.

(Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan) The Yongning County Party Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region recently organized a hundred-person inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the county's cadres' implementation of the "Two-Five System," starting with an inspection of current production.

In late May of this year, Yongning County studied and promoted the experience of the "Two-Five System" leadership method in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province. In the past month or so, it has achieved remarkable results. More than 90% of the county's cadres have gone deep into 206 production squads to strengthen leadership over grassroots production units. In order to summarize the experience of promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method in a timely manner and gradually make the "Two-Five System" systematic and regular, the Yongning County Party Committee adopted the method of four-level cadre meeting to investigate actions and see results, investigate problems and increase measures, inspecting, comparing, holding forums, summarizing, and promoting simultaneously.

Based on the problems identified in the inspection, the county party committee promptly put forward improvement measures at the recent four-level cadre meeting of counties, communes, brigades, and production teams. In order to combine points and faces, the county party committee required the first secretaries of the county, commune, and brigade-level party organizations, in addition to spending one day a week studying work and one day learning with all cadres, to combine going deep into key squads and working with commune members with conducting roving inspections and comprehensively grasping the situation in order to better guide the overall work. The county party committee also decided to carry out a competition of "comparing more work points, comparing more making close friends, and comparing more solving problems" among all cadres. Not only must they eat, live, and work with commune members, but they must also consult with them. After the responsible cadres sent by the county and the commune party secretary go to the production squad, they should cooperate closely with the grassroots cadres, offer specific advice, and help them learn the working methods of grasping key points, finding problems, and following the mass line. Party committees at all levels should further strengthen the political theory and policy study of cadres at all levels and raise the work of political and ideological education to a primary position. A "Socialist Education Network Committee" was formed, headed by the first secretary of the county party committee and composed of relevant departments of the county; and at the weekly work inspection meeting, study notes were checked, cadres who actively studied were commended, and backward cadres were helped and led. Regarding the issue of accounting, statistics, storage, and clerical personnel participating in labor, the county is currently trying to promote the method of Yanghe Commune, that is, the squad handles business work at home at both ends (handling business work at home in the morning and evening) and works in the fields in the middle (participating in labor); the brigade completes one day of work in half a day, and the remaining half day goes to the fields.

    查行动看效果　查问题增措施
    天水专区永宁县委检查执行“二五制”情况
    本报讯　甘肃省天水专区在检查总结贯彻“二五制”的基础上，结合当地情况和特点，进一步制定了具体方法措施，开始普遍实行“三七制”领导方法。
    天水专区八个县（市）、一百二十七个人民公社，在7月初以前曾普遍根据中央和省地委关于改进领导方法、提高领导水平的指示精神，推行了“二五制”和“五十制”。从执行的情况看，这种领导方法对于改进领导作风、改进工作方法，对于推动当前各项生产，都起到了显著作用，也受到了广大社员的热烈欢迎。
    推行“二五制”的好处主要表现在：一、深入生产第一线、参加生产领导生产的干部急遽增加。干部参加生产以后，激发了生产队干部和广大群众的劳动积极性。同时，由于领导干部参加生产，领导生产，生产中许多具体问题都得到了解决，因而大大推动了当前各项生产。二、加强了基层领导。全区深入生产第一线的干部，绝大部分已深入到边远山区、后进公社、后进生产队，包社、包队、包作物，彻底改变落后面貌，促进各项工作平衡发展。三、初步扭转了县、公社、大队领导机关以往“蹲在上面，浮在表面”的情况，广大干部以普通劳动者姿态深入实际，深入群众，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，和农民交知心朋友，更加密切了领导干部和基层干部、干部和群众的关系。同时，由于干部深入下去，发现问题及时，解决问题及时。四、保证干部有了固定的学习党的政策和学习理论的时间。
    中共天水地委最近召开了常委扩大会议，对这一阶段情况作了检查总结，并对进一步贯彻“二五制”领导方法问题，专门进行了研究讨论。会议决定：一、根据天水地区公社一般较大，居住比较分散，集中不够方便的特点和前一阶段推行“二五制”的经验，全区、县、公社和大队今后一律推行“三七制”。即每旬前三天学习、开会，研究安排工作，后七天深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产，帮助基层解决问题。上下对口，时间统一。在三天集中学习和布置工作的时间中，必须保证有一天的学习时间。普遍推行“三七制”后，县、公社党委和专区机关应留定量人员，处理机关工作，负责多方联系，掌握全面情况。二、各级在推行“三七制”中，根据具体情况和需要讨论的中心问题，由县、公社党委，生产大队总支事先安排集中地点、参加人、讨论议题，事先通知有关人员。除专题研究外，一般干部集中在社、队进行学习，检查布置工作。三、县、社级机关在公社、生产队工作的干部，每月应有一次集中到县参加“三七制”活动，总结研究，安排本部门的工作。四、下到生产队、生产小队的县、公社、大队干部，应当帮助党的基层组织，建立定期的组织生活制度，一月一次党员大会，一旬一次支部委员会议，半月一次小组会议。帮助基层党员、干部学习党的有关农村工作的方针政策或规定，整顿县、公社党校，有计划轮训干部，提高培养干部。五、凡到农村工作的干部，一律凭票到社员食堂吃饭，并积极参加办好公共食堂。六、农村不脱产的支部书记应与大队干部一起参加“三七制”活动，时间为每旬两天，一天学习，一天安排工作。
    目前，地委这一决定已普遍传达到县。各县、公社党委，大队总支的许多领导干部已纷纷表示在原有推行“二五制”领导方法的基础上，乘胜前进，坚决执行地委关于执行“三七制”的决定。部分县社已开始实行。
    据新华社银川讯　中共宁夏回族自治区永宁县委最近组织百人检查团，从检查当前生产入手，对全县干部执行“二五制”的情况，进行了一次全面的检查。
    今年5月下旬，永宁县学习和推广了河北省吴桥县“二五制”领导方法的经验，一个多月以来，已经取得了显著成效，全县90％以上的干部，深入到二百零六个生产小队，加强了对基层生产单位的领导。为了及时总结推行“二五制”领导方法的经验，使“二五制”逐步达到制度化、经常化，中共永宁县委采取四级干部会师的办法，查行动看效果，查问题增措施，边检查、边评比、边座谈、边总结、边推广。
    根据检查出的问题，县委在最近召开的县、公社、大队、生产队四级干部会议上，及时提出了改进的措施。为了做到点面结合，县委要求县、公社、大队三级党组织的第一书记，除了和全体干部一起，每周用一天时间研究工作、一天学习外，把深入重点小队和社员一起劳动同巡回检查、全面掌握情况结合起来，以便更好地指导全盘工作。县委还决定在全体干部中，开展“比工分多，比交知心朋友多，比解决问题多”的竞赛活动，不仅要做到和社员同吃同住同劳动，而且要同商量。县里下去的负责干部和公社党委书记到生产小队后，要和基层干部密切合作，具体出谋划策，帮助他们学会抓关键、找问题和走群众路线的工作方法。各级党委要进一步加强各级干部的政治理论和政策学习，把政治思想教育工作提高到首要地位。由县委第一书记挂帅，县各有关部门组成一个“社会主义教育网委员会”；并在每周检查工作的会议上，检查学习笔记，表扬学习积极的干部，帮助和带动后进。关于会计、统计、保管和文书等人员参加劳动的问题，全县正在试行推广养和公社的办法，即小队是两头在家办（早晨和晚上在家办理业务工作）、中间田里干（参加劳动）；大队是一天工作半天完，剩下半天去下田。
