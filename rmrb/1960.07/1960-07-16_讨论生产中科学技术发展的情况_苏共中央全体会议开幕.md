Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 15th: According to TASS, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened on the 13th in the Kremlin. The meeting was chaired by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.

The Plenary Session will discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress on the development of industry, transportation, and the adoption of the latest achievements of science and technology in production.

On the 13th, reports were made by Gerasimov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation; Shenin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR; and the chairmen of the National Economic Councils of Latvia, Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, and Karaganda Economic Regions.

In his report, Gerasimov said that this year, the Russian Federation will reach the 1961 level stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in the production of rolled ferrous metals, nickel, metal-cutting machine tools, forging equipment, agricultural machinery, and other most important products. He said that in 1959-1960, nearly one million tons more pig iron, three million tons more steel, and two million tons more steel would be produced than originally planned in the Seven-Year Plan.

Gerasimov emphasized that, like the entire country, the Russian Federation has widely adopted advanced technology. He said that the struggle for technological progress has a truly national character. He pointed out that it is necessary to most rapidly manufacture equipment for wider production automation.

In his report, Shenin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, said that Ukraine has already surpassed the United States in the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products per capita, in the mining of coal, iron ore, and manganese ore, and in the production of sugar and animal oil.

He said that in Ukraine, a competition has been launched to fulfill the Seven-Year Plan in five or six years in industry and in five years in agriculture.

Speaking of the adoption of new technologies and advanced technological procedures, Shenin said that in the past year and a half alone, the number of engineering and technical personnel in the scientific research institutions of Ukrainian industry has increased by 50%, reaching 100,000. He also emphasized that more than 1.2 million people in Ukraine are participating in the movement of Communist Labor Collectives and shock workers.

Gäle, Chairman of the Latvian National Economic Council, said at the meeting that in 1959 alone, the increase in Latvian industrial production was greater than the total industrial output of bourgeois Latvia in 1939. He said that in Latvian factories, workers and engineers widely participated in the formulation of technological progress plans for the Seven-Year Plan, and on this basis, a general plan for technological progress in the republic was formulated.

Lomako, Chairman of the Krasnoyarsk National Economic Council, said at the meeting that the Krasnoyarsk Territory would become a major industrial center of Siberia during the Seven-Year Plan. The realization of the long-term plan for the development of the national economy for twenty years will make the territory one of the main economic regions of the Soviet Union with a highly developed power industry, and on the basis of this power industry, the largest mechanized and automated enterprises of non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy, and a series of basic chemical, wood processing, food, and light industrial enterprises will be established.

Grafov, Chairman of the Kemerovo National Economic Council, said that the Kemerovo Economic Region, located in the center of Siberia, possesses huge natural treasures and is a huge base for the coal industry, chemical, metallurgical, machine-building, and power industries. He pointed out that the total value of products in the Kemerovo region will double during the Seven-Year Plan. By 1965, the proportion of heavy industry production in the region's total output value will reach 92%.

Bratchinko, Chairman of the Karaganda National Economic Council, reported that the area of the Karaganda Economic Region exceeds the combined territory of France, Belgium, and Austria. The Soviet Union's third coal base, a huge non-ferrous metallurgical industry center, and construction industry enterprises have been built there; ferrous metallurgy, the chemical industry, and machine manufacturing are being built rapidly.

Bratchinko said that the Karaganda Economic Region has huge coking coal deposits, unique copper deposits in terms of scale, and rich iron ore deposits. There are also a large number of rare elements there. It is planned to build one hundred and thirty-five enterprises there.

The Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee is continuing.

    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议13日在克里姆林宫开幕。会议由苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫主持。
    全会将讨论苏共第二十一次代表大会关于发展工业、运输业和在生产中采用科学技术最新成就的决议执行情况的问题。
    在13日会议上作报告的有：俄罗斯联邦部长会议副主席格拉西莫夫，乌克兰部长会议副主席谢宁，以及拉脱维亚、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、基米罗伏和卡拉干达经济区国民经济委员会的主席。
    格拉西莫夫在报告中说，今年，俄罗斯联邦在黑色金属轧材、镍、金属切削机床、锻压设备、农业机器和其他最重要产品的生产方面将达到七年计划规定的1961年的水平。他说，在1959—1960年，将比七年计划原订的任务多生产差不多一百万吨生铁，三百万吨钢和二百万吨钢材。
    格拉西莫夫强调指出，同全国一样，俄罗斯联邦广泛地采用了先进技术。他说，争取技术进步的斗争具有真正的全民性质。他指出，必须最迅速地制造更广泛的生产自动化的设备。
    乌克兰共和国部长会议副主席谢宁在报告中说，乌克兰现在在生铁、钢、钢材按人口平均计算的产量方面，在煤、铁矿和锰矿的开采方面，在糖和动物油的产量方面已经超过了美国。
    他说，在乌克兰，展开了在工业方面争取五、六年，在农业方面争取五年完成七年计划的生产的竞赛。
    谢宁在谈到采用新技术和先进的工艺规程以后说，最近一年半以来，仅仅在乌克兰工业的科学研究机关中，工程技术人员就增加了50％，达到十万人。他还着重指出，在乌克兰，参加共产主义劳动集体和突击手运动的有一百二十多万人。
    拉脱维亚国民经济委员会主席盖列在会上说，仅1959年一年，拉脱维亚工业生产的增长额就比1939年资产阶级拉脱维亚的工业总产量还多。他说，在拉脱维亚各工厂中，工人和工程师广泛参加制订七年计划的技术进步计划，并在这个基础上制订了共和国的技术进步的总计划。
    克拉斯诺雅尔斯克国民经济委员会主席洛马科在会上说，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区在七年计划中就将成为西伯利亚的大工业中心。发展国民经济二十年远景计划的实现将使边疆区成为拥有高度发达的动力工业的苏联主要经济区之一，将在这个动力工业的基础上建立起有色和黑色冶金业最大的机械化和自动化企业，一系列基本化学、木材加工、食品和轻工业企业。
    基米罗伏国民经济委员会主席格拉弗夫说，位于西伯利亚中心的基米罗伏经济区拥有巨大的天然宝藏，是煤炭工业、化学、冶金、机器制造和动力工业的巨大基地。他指出，基米罗伏区的产品总值在七年计划内将增加一倍。到1965年，重工业部门的生产在本区的总产值中的比重将达到92％。
    卡拉干达国民经济委员会主席勃拉钦科在报告中说，卡拉干达经济区的面积超过法国、比利时、奥地利的领土的总和，在那里建成了苏联的第三个煤炭基地、一个巨大的有色冶金工业中心和建筑工业企业；正在快速地建设黑色冶金业、化学工业和机器制造业。
    勃拉钦科说，卡拉干达经济区有巨大的焦煤矿，埋藏着就其规模来讲是独一无二的铜矿、富饶的铁矿。那里还有大量的稀有元素。计划在那里建设一百三十五个企业。
