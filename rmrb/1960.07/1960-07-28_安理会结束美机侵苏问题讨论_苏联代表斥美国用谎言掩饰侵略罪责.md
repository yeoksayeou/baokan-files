Xinhua News Agency, July 27th (TASS dispatch from New York): The United Nations Security Council concluded its discussion on the Soviet Union's complaint regarding the new act of aggression by a U.S. RB-47 military aircraft against the Soviet Union on the evening of the 26th. The Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal with a majority of nine votes. This proposal suggested condemning the continued violation of Soviet airspace by U.S. military aircraft as an act of aggression and demanding that the U.S. government immediately cease such actions and prevent their recurrence. The Soviet and Polish representatives voted in favor of this proposal.

Subsequently, a vote was taken on the U.S. proposal, which suggested establishing a committee to conduct a protracted "investigation" into the "RB-47" aircraft incident or referring the issue to the International Court of Justice in order to evade condemnation for the U.S. act of aggression. Nine delegations voted in favor of this proposal. However, due to the Soviet delegation, as a permanent member of the Security Council, casting a veto, this proposal was not adopted. The Polish delegation also voted against the U.S. proposal.

Another Italian proposal, which essentially amounted to a suggestion of interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, was also vetoed by the Soviet and Polish representatives. The Italian proposal suggested requesting the Soviet government to allow the International Red Cross to establish contact with the captured U.S. Air Force pilots.

Soviet representative Kuznetsov stated at the meeting on the 26th that, for many years, the U.S. government had consistently pursued a policy of open provocation against the Soviet Union by sending military aircraft to violate Soviet airspace. He condemned the U.S. for denying the fact of violating Soviet airspace while falsely accusing the Soviet Union of shooting down a U.S. aircraft over international waters. Kuznetsov pointed out that this attempt by the U.S. was intended to confuse world opinion and evade responsibility for its crimes. He emphasized that the U.S. government was increasingly relying on lies to conceal the failure of its aggressive policy.

Kuznetsov finally emphasized that the U.S. RB-47 aircraft incident was yet another manifestation of the U.S. policy of aggression. This policy constituted a serious threat to world peace and an obstacle to the easing of international tensions and the normalization of relations between countries. He said that the U.S. must immediately and forever cease its actions.

    安理会结束美机侵苏问题讨论
    苏联代表斥美国用谎言掩饰侵略罪责
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会26日晚间结束了对苏联提出的关于美国RB—47式军用飞机对苏联进行了新的侵略的问题的讨论。安全理事会以九票多数否决了苏联提案，这个提案建议谴责美国军用飞机继续对苏联进行的侵犯活动是侵略行动，并且要求美国政府立即停止这种行动和防止这类事情重演。苏联和波兰代表投票赞成这个提案。
    接着对美国提出的、建议成立一个委员会，来对“RB—47”式飞机事件进行旷日持久的“调查”，或把这个问题交给国际法庭处理，以逃避对美国侵略行动的谴责的提案进行表决。赞成这个提案的有九个代表团。由于作为安理会常任理事国的苏联代表团投了反对票，这个提案没有获得通过。投票反对美国提案的还有波兰代表团。
    另一个实质上等于建议干涉苏联内政的意大利提案也遭到了苏联和波兰代表的否决。意大利提案建议要求苏联政府允许国际红十字同被俘的美国空军驾驶员建立接触。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫在26日的会议上发言指出，多年以来，美国政府就一贯奉行对苏联公开挑衅的政策，派遣军用飞机侵犯苏联领空。他谴责美国抵赖侵犯苏联领空的事实，而反诬苏联在公海上空击落美国飞机。库兹涅佐夫指出，美国的这种企图是想要混淆世界视听和逃避罪责。他强调指出，美国政府愈来愈频繁地依靠谎言来掩盖它的侵略政策的失败。
    库兹涅佐夫最后强调说，美国RB—47式飞机事件是美国侵略政策的又一个表现。这种政策构成了对世界和平的严重威胁，以及对国际紧张局势缓和和国与国之间关系正常化的障碍。他说，美国必须立即和永远停止它的这种行动。
