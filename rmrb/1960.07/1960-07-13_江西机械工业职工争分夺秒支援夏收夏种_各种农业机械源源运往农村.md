　　Nanchang, July 12th (By our reporter) – In Jiangxi Province, agricultural machinery industry workers, with the spirit of staying ahead of the farming season, starting early, and taking the initiative, have launched a high tide of manufacturing tools for the summer harvest and planting. Currently, the province has completed over 80% of its annual agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery manufacturing plan. 161 tractors, 600 sets of tractor-drawn farm implements, 38,680 horsepower of agricultural irrigation and drainage power machinery, and over 1.3 million pieces of semi-mechanized and improved agricultural tools such as waterwheels, rice transplanters, quick harvesters, and threshing machines, as well as over 110,000 pieces of plowing and harrowing tools, and nearly 10,000 vehicles have been manufactured. At the same time, vigorous improvements have been made to various tools, striving to equip the main processes of agricultural summer harvest and planting, such as water lifting, inter-tillage, harvesting, transportation, threshing, and processing, with advanced tools in a complete set. Various agricultural machines are being continuously shipped to rural areas.
　　The summer harvest and planting season in Jiangxi Province generally starts in mid-July, with a relatively dry and rain-scarce climate. The amount of agricultural water irrigation and drainage has been large in previous years. With the expansion of the summer harvest and planting area this year, the demand for agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment is both urgent and high. To ensure a bumper harvest, the Jiangxi mechanical industry front, according to the provincial Party committee's instructions, shortened the battle lines on one hand, concentrated forces to rush the manufacturing and repairing of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment; on the other hand, changed the past practice of mainly relying on key provincial enterprises for manufacturing, and adopted the method of "walking on two legs" to overcome various difficulties, mobilizing special (city) and county machinery industries to join the ranks of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment manufacturing, greatly enhancing the manufacturing force, thus enabling the manufacturing of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment to be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically, gaining time.
　　One of the first problems encountered by special (city) and county mechanical industries participating in the manufacturing of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment was the shortage of raw materials and fuels such as steel, pig iron, and coke; and the lack of relatively precise machine tools such as milling machines and boring machines. Factories and enterprises in various places, based on the spirit of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, first broke through the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment through methods such as improving technology, improving design, saving and substituting materials, and using indigenous methods to replace foreign ones, and combining indigenous and foreign methods.
　　In the tense moment of building agricultural machinery in large quantities, all the workers fully displayed the spirit of practical work and skillful work, daring to think and daring to do, always focusing on production and always thinking of the peasants. When the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory was producing agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery, in order to improve quality and reduce costs, a technical revolution staff headquarters composed of leaders, technicians, and workers was formed, adopting the method of "learning while learning from experience, drawing sketches while learning, determining the plan while learning" and the "visiting during the day, discussing at night, determining the plan, and starting the design; resolving disputes, meeting at the scene" method of "watching, discussing, and deciding", achieved triple harvests in ideology, innovation, and production, not only increasing the horsepower of the same diesel engine from 20 to 30, saving 50% of materials, and greatly reducing costs, but also increasing labor productivity, with the diesel engines produced in June being three and a half times that of the same period last year. The Leping Machinery Factory improved the design of the gas engine, increasing it from 10 horsepower to 15 horsepower. The workers of the Nankang County Machinery Factory displayed the spirit of great collaboration, working in shifts day and night to rush the gears and iron wires for rice transplanters, harvesters, and threshers, enabling the county's farm implement factories to smoothly manufacture more than 3,300 rice transplanters, harvesters, and threshers.
　　"Rather let the machine wait for the farming season than let the farming season wait for the machine; rather be bothered thousands of times ourselves than let the peasants feel slightly inconvenienced." In order to ensure that the harvesting, transportation, and threshing tools are manufactured, installed, and repaired before the summer harvest, factories are strengthening leadership and carrying out technical revolution movements in depth to ensure the manufacture of more agricultural machinery to support agricultural production.

　　江西机械工业职工争分夺秒支援夏收夏种
　　各种农业机械源源运往农村
    本报南昌12日电　江西省农业机械工业职工，本着走在农时前面，早动手，争主动的精神，掀起了制造夏收夏种工具的高潮。目前，全省已完成全年农业排灌机械制造计划的80％以上，已制成拖拉机一百六十一台，机引农具六百部，农业排灌动力机械三万八千六百八十马力，水车、插秧机、快速收割器、打谷机等半机械化和改良农具一百三十多万件，耕地耙地农具十一万多件，车辆将近一万部。同时，并对各项工具大力进行了改进，争取把农业夏收、夏种从提水、中耕、收割、运输、脱粒、加工等主要工序，用先进工具配套成龙。各种农业机械正源源运往农村。
    江西省农业夏收夏种季节，一般都在7月中旬开始，气候比较干旱、少雨，历年来农业用水的排灌量都很大。随着今年夏收夏种面积的扩大，对农业排灌设备的需要量既急且多。为了确保粮食丰收，江西机械工业战线根据省委指示，一面缩短战线，集中力量赶制赶修农业排灌设备；一面改变了过去主要依靠省属重点企业制造的作法，采取两条腿走路的办法克服各项困难，发动专（市）、县机械工业一齐投入了农业排灌设备的制造行列，大大增强了制造力量，从而使农业排灌设备的制造得以多快好省地进行，争得了时间。
    专（市）、县机械工业参加制造农业排灌设备，首先碰到的一个问题是，钢材、生铁、焦炭等原材燃料不足；铣床、搪床等较精密的机床设备缺乏。各地工厂企业便本着自力更生，土洋并举的精神，首先通过改进工艺、改进设计、节约代用和以土代洋、土洋结合等办法，突破了原材料、设备不足的难关。
    在大造农业机械的紧张时刻里，全体职工充分发挥了实干巧干，敢想敢做的精神，时时从生产着眼，处处为农民着想。南昌柴油机厂在生产农业排灌机械时，为了提高质量，降低成本，由领导、技术人员、工人“三结合”组成技术革命参谋指挥部，采取“边取经，边学习，边绘草图，边定方案”和
  “白天参观，晚上讨论，确定方案，动手设计；发生争执，会师现场”的“边看、边议、边决”的方法，取得了思想、革新、生产三丰收，不仅使一台同样的柴油机，由二十马力提高到三十马力，节省材料50％，大大降低了成本，而且还提高了劳动生产率，到6月份生产的柴油机就为去年同期的三倍半。乐平机械厂在制造煤气机中，改进了设计，由十马力提高到十五马力。南康县机械厂职工发挥了大协作精神，日夜轮班赶制插秧机、收割机、打谷机上的齿轮、铁丝等零件，使全县各农具厂顺利地制造了插秧机、收割机、打谷机三千三百多部。
    “宁让机器等农时，不让农时等机器，宁愿自己麻烦千遍，不让农民稍感不便”。为了保证在夏收前制好、装好、修好收割、运输、脱粒等工具，各工厂正在加强领导、深入开展技术革命运动，以保证制造出更多的农业机械，支援农业生产。（附图片）
