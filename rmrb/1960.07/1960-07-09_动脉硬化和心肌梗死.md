    Arteriosclerosis and Myocardial Infarction
    Fu Lianzhang

    Arteries bear the task of delivering blood to the whole body, supplying nutrition to various organs. They are elastic and have strong ability to dilate and contract. Coordinating with the pressure applied to the blood when the heart contracts, they propel the blood forward and maintain a certain blood pressure. Arteriosclerosis means a decline in its elasticity, thickening of the vessel wall, increased hardness, and narrowing of the lumen; obviously, this situation will affect the smooth passage and normal transport of blood.
    Arteriosclerosis is sometimes not an independent disease, but merely a change concurrent with a certain disease. For example, widespread arteriosclerosis of small arteries may occur in the later stage of primary hypertension. But what we usually call arteriosclerosis is an independent disease, a disease belonging to cholesterol metabolism disorders, because its hardening starts from the deposition of cholesterol in the inner layer of the arterial wall. This change mainly involves large arteries and medium-sized arteries in the heart, brain, kidneys, limbs, etc. The cholesterol plaques deposited in the arterial wall sometimes degenerate and decompose in local tissues, resembling porridge, so this hardening is usually called atherosclerosis.
    Cholesterol is a type of fat-like substance. It is widely present in nature, especially in cream, eggs, or other animal fats, where it is relatively abundant. After people eat these foods, they are digested and absorbed, resynthesized in the intestinal wall, and then enter the blood. After a series of metabolic transformations, they are excreted through the intestines, bile ducts, and sweat glands. With this normal pathway of digestion, absorption, utilization, and excretion, cholesterol should not be deposited in the arterial wall. Therefore, arteriosclerosis can only occur when there are obstacles in this metabolic pathway.
    In fact, the causes of cholesterol metabolism disorders and atherosclerosis are very complex. Simply put, to allow more cholesterol in the blood to enter and deposit in the arterial wall, at least the following conditions are required: either the cholesterol content in the blood is increased, or the permeability of the inner layer of the arterial wall is enhanced. The increase in cholesterol content in the blood is often due to the imbalance of metabolism in the human body. Excessive cholesterol in food also has a certain impact, but the former is the main one. For example, in some endocrine system diseases (like diabetes), changes in cholesterol content in the blood are not completely dependent on the amount of cholesterol in food. As for the increase in permeability of the inner layer of the arterial wall, although it is related to some structural factors, it is more often caused by the spastic (i.e., continuous and intense) contraction of the arterial wall. However, in the final analysis, arterial spasm can be regarded as an abnormal nerve reflex phenomenon, and metabolic disorders should be attributed to the disorder of nerve regulation. Therefore, it should be said that nervous disorders are an important factor in causing atherosclerosis. According to statistics, the incidence rate among mental workers is higher than that of physical workers, which may be related to excessive tension in the nervous system and insufficient physical activity. In addition, the toxicity of nicotine can also cause vascular spasm, and a diet that is too fatty can also promote the occurrence of arteriosclerosis. All these complex factors, specific to each patient, have many commonalities and their own particularities, and cannot be generalized, especially cannot one-sidedly emphasize the effect of a single external cause.
    What harm does atherosclerosis actually bring to the body? If only some cholesterol is deposited in the inner layer of the arterial wall, forming a soft plaque, it is still irrelevant. The problem is that on the basis of this change, it will eventually cause the growth of fibrous tissue and even the formation of lime, so the blood vessels will become greatly hardened, the elasticity of the blood vessels will be reduced, and the lumen will also become narrower. Especially when it occurs in medium-sized arteries, there will be obvious obstacles to blood circulation, thereby affecting the cell nutrition in the area controlled by this artery; with less nutrition, the function will also decline. If cerebral arteriosclerosis is widespread, it can cause intellectual decline; if the coronary arteries that nourish the heart are hardened, it may lead to its dysfunction and cause a disease called "angina pectoris"; even more seriously, after arteriosclerosis, the narrow and irregular lumen makes it easy for the flowing liquid blood to solidify here, just like a winding and irregular riverbed easily causes siltation. At this time, the solidified blood clot (or thrombus) completely blocks the arterial lumen, and the area it controls may die due to the interruption of nutrition, which is called "infarction." The death of some myocardial cells due to the blockage of a branch of the heart's coronary artery is called myocardial infarction.
    Angina pectoris or myocardial infarction can also be caused by spasm of the coronary arteries, and arteriosclerosis and arterial spasm often go hand in hand. Spasm can promote hardening, and hardened arteries are prone to spasm. Furthermore, although local blockage of the heart's coronary arteries may cause myocardial infarction or even cardiac arrest and lead to death, in many cases, it is not destined to lead to unfortunate consequences: for example, if the range of arterial blockage is not large or the location is not very important, the intact arteries on the side can also "support" the nutrition of this ischemic part, so that infarction does not occur, and even if it occurs, the dead part can be gradually replaced by living scar tissue, thereby turning danger into safety.
    In order to have a more comprehensive understanding of arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction, the following points should be added:
    Some people think that arteriosclerosis is an inevitable disease of the elderly, which is inappropriate. It is true that the elderly have varying degrees of arteriosclerosis, but it does not necessarily constitute a disease. As an independent disease, atherosclerosis occurs more often in the elderly, but many elderly people can avoid it; on the other hand, a few young adults may also suffer from it. Because, as mentioned earlier, the primary basis of this disease is metabolic disorder, and age is a secondary factor.
    The systemic atherosclerosis and the changes in the heart's coronary arteries do not develop in a balanced way. Sometimes systemic arteriosclerosis is obvious, but the coronary arteries are still intact or only have slight changes. Therefore, patients do not need to worry too much about the changes in the heart. The state of heart function should be judged by a doctor's examination.
    Atherosclerosis, including sclerosis of the heart's coronary arteries, is not an incurable disease. Animal experiments have proved that cholesterol-deposited plaques and even hyperplastic fibrous tissue can subside and heal themselves. The key issue is to have reasonable treatment and recuperation. The method of recuperation is to pay attention to the combination of work and rest. In addition to work, there should be good rest. Mental workers should have appropriate outdoor activities to breathe fresh air. According to the condition of the disease and the doctor's advice, choose suitable gymnastics, Tai Chi, or Qigong and other beneficial activities, which are all beneficial to adjusting the body's metabolic function; secondly, control the addiction to tobacco and alcohol. While ensuring reasonable nutrition in the diet, it is also important to pay attention to a light diet. Some people advocate that it is unnecessary to ban certain animal fats. Obviously, this view exaggerates the role of food in the occurrence of arteriosclerosis.
    Finally, it should also be particularly mentioned that people with atherosclerosis cannot take a completely paralyzed attitude. That is to say, they cannot ignore treatment and appropriate recuperation. For example, people who have coronary arteriosclerosis or have had poor heart function and have recovered may seem to be normal at a certain time, but it is worth noting that the reserve working capacity of this changed heart is reduced. For example, if two people each carry a load of one hundred pounds, they both seem to be competent and happy, but if one of them adds another one hundred pounds, they can still bear it, while the other one will be crushed if they add another one hundred pounds. The latter is a manifestation of insufficient reserve strength. People who have had poor heart function should have this vigilance. But as long as they pay attention to the combination of work and rest and reasonable recuperation, they can prevent unexpected misfortunes from happening.
    In short, arteriosclerosis is not a disease that the elderly must suffer from, and even if they do, it is not incurable. There is no need to worry about it too much; on the other hand, patients must pay attention to it, persevere in fighting the disease, and they will be able to turn danger into safety, eliminate diseases and prolong life.

    动脉硬化和心肌梗死
    傅连暲
    动脉血管承担着把血液输送到全身，供给各个器官营养的任务。它富有弹性，有较强的舒张和收缩的能力，配合着心脏收缩时所加于血液的压力，推动着血液前进，维持一定的血压。所谓动脉硬化就意味着它弹性的减退，管壁增厚，硬度增加，和管腔变小；显然这样的情况就会影响到血液顺利的通过和正常的运送。
    动脉硬化有时不是独立的疾病，而只是并发于某种疾病的一种变化，如原发性高血压病的后期就有可能发生小动脉的广泛性硬化。但我们通常所称的动脉硬化，则是一种独立疾病，是属于胆固醇代谢障碍的疾病，因为它的硬化是由于胆固醇在动脉管壁内层沉积而开始的。这种变化主要累及大型动脉和心、脑、肾、四肢等处的中型动脉。沉积在动脉壁内的胆固醇斑块有时因局部组织的退化分解，形同糜粥一样，因此这种硬化通常被称为动脉粥样硬化。
    胆固醇是属于类脂肪质的一种物质。它广泛存在于自然界中，特别如奶油、鸡蛋或其它动物性油脂内含量比较多。人吃了这些食物以后，经过消化、吸收，在肠壁内重新合成，再输入血液内，经过一番代谢转化，又经肠子、胆道、汗腺排泄出去。有了这一套消化、吸收、利用、排泄的正常途径，照理胆固醇是不应该在动脉管壁内沉积下来的。因之动脉硬化只能在这种代谢途径有了障碍时才会发生。
    讲起来造成胆固醇代谢障碍和动脉粥样硬化的原因是很复杂的。简单的说要使血内胆固醇较多的进入动脉管壁内沉积，至少需要这样的条件：或是血内胆固醇含量加多了，或是动脉管壁内层的透过性增强了。而血内胆固醇含量的增多，常是由于人体内代谢状况的失调所致，食物中含胆固醇过多也有一定影响，但前者是主要的，如某些内分泌系统的疾病（像糖尿病），血内胆固醇含量的变化，就不完全因人食物中含量的多寡为转移。至于动脉管内层透过性的增加，虽然也与一些构造上的因素有关，而更多的是因动脉管的痉挛性（也即持续的较强度的）收缩所引起。然而归根结底：动脉血管痉挛可视为一种不正常的神经反射现象，物质代谢的失调又要归咎于神经调节作用的紊乱。所以应该说神经性障碍是引起动脉粥样硬化的重要因素。根据统计，脑力劳动者发病的比体力劳动者为多，或许与神经系统紧张太过和体力活动不足有相当关系。此外烟碱的毒性也可以引起血管的痉挛，以及食物偏于肥腻，都能助长动脉硬化的发生。所有这些复杂的因素，具体到每个病人身上，会有许多共同的地方而又各有其特殊性，不能一概而论，特别不能片面强调某种单一的外因作用。
    动脉粥样硬化究竟给身体带来什么危害性呢？如果仅仅一些胆固醇在动脉管壁内层沉积起来，形成一个柔软的小斑块，还是无关紧要的，问题在于在这种变化的基础上，久之又要引起纤维组织的增长甚至石灰质的生成，这样血管就大大变硬了，血管弹性减低了，而管腔也要变窄。特别发生在中型的动脉将有明显的血液流通的障碍，从而影响到这支动脉管所支配的领域内的细胞营养；营养少了，功能也就要下降。如果脑动脉较广泛的硬化可以引起人的智力衰退；如果营养心脏的冠状动脉硬化可能导致它的功能障碍而发生一种名为“狭心症”的疾病；更严重些的是动脉硬化后，狭窄而不整齐的管腔易使流动的液体状态的血液，在这里凝固起来，就好像迂曲不整齐的河床容易造成泥沙淤积一样。这时凝固的血块（或者称为血栓）完全使动脉管腔阻塞了，而它所支配的领域可能因营养的断绝造成局部细胞的死灭，这就是所谓“梗死”。由于心冠状动脉的某一分枝的阻塞而致的部分心肌细胞的死灭，就叫做心肌梗死。
    狭心症或心肌梗死也可以由于冠状动脉的痉挛所引起，而动脉硬化与动脉管的痉挛往往是相辅而行的，痉挛可以促使硬化，硬化了的动脉又易于发生痉挛。再说心脏冠状动脉的局部阻塞虽然可能引起心肌梗死甚至心脏麻痹而致人于死亡，但很多时候也不是注定要走向不幸的后果：如像动脉管阻塞的范围不大或者部位不太重要，旁侧完好的动脉还能“支援”这一缺血部分的营养，使梗死不致发生，即使发生了，死灭的部分也可以逐步为有生命的瘢痕组织所代替，从而转危为安。
    为了更全面的认识动脉硬化和心肌梗死，还须作以下几点补充说明：
    有人认为动脉硬化是老年人不可避免的一种疾病，那是不合适的。诚然老年人都有不同程度的动脉硬化现象，但不一定都构成一种病象。作为一个独立疾病的粥样硬化症，虽然比较起来老年人发生的要多些，而许多老年人是可以不发生的；另一方面少数青壮年也可能罹患。因为如前所说，作为这一疾病的首要基础是物质代谢的障碍，而年龄的关系则是次要的。
    全身的动脉粥样硬化与心脏冠状动脉的变化并不是平衡发展的。有时全身动脉硬化明显，而冠状动脉却还完好或仅有轻微的变化。所以患者不必为心脏的变化过份耽忧。心脏功能的状态，应该由医生的检查来判断。
    动脉粥样硬化包括心冠状动脉的硬化在内，并不是不可以治愈的疾病。动物实验证明，胆固醇沉积的斑块甚至增生的纤维组织都能消退而自愈，关键问题在于要合理的治疗和调养。疗养的方法，首先要注意劳逸结合，工作之余要有很好的休息，脑力劳动者更要有适当的户外活动，呼吸新鲜空气，按照疾病的情况根据医生的建议，选择合适的体操、打太极拳或作作气功等有益的活动，这些都有益于调整身体的代谢功能；其次节制烟酒嗜好，饮食方面在保证合理营养的同时，注意清淡一些也很重要。有人主张禁绝某些动物脂类食品是不必要的，显然这种观点是夸大了食物对于发生动脉硬化的作用。
    最后还应该特别提到，患有动脉粥样硬化的人也不能采取一种完全麻痹的态度。也就是说不能不注意治疗和适当的调摄。如像患有心脏冠状动脉硬化或者曾经有过心脏功能不好已经恢复了的人，在某一时期看来一切也还正常，但是值得注意的是，这种有过变化的心脏，它的后备工作能力减低了。比如两个人各挑一百斤的担子，看来都是胜任愉快的，但其中一个人再加上一百斤也还能担当起来，而另一个人再加上一百斤就要被压坏了，后者就是后备力量不足的表现。患过心脏机能不好的人，要有这种警惕。但只要注意了劳逸结合和合理的调摄，就可以防止意外不幸的发生。
    总之，动脉硬化并不是老年必患的疾病，患了也不是不可以治疗的，不必为它而过份忧虑；另一方面患者也必须重视起来，坚持与疾病作斗争，就能化险为夷，却病延年了。
