Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on July 4th: In June, the Soviet Union launched single-stage ballistic rockets according to plan to explore the upper atmosphere and cosmic space.

    The rocket launch was successful. It reached a predetermined altitude of 208 kilometers.

    Scientific exploration instruments were sent to the upper atmosphere, with the instruments, energy sources, and animals carried (two dogs and one rabbit) weighing a total of 2,100 kilograms.

    The animals were in good condition after landing. One of the dogs, named "Valiant," completed its fifth space journey this time.

    The exploration plan has been fully completed.

    Valuable materials were obtained regarding observations of ionized clouds formed at high altitudes, the ionic composition and electrical properties of the atmosphere, Earth and solar radiation, and new materials regarding the muscle tension of animals in weightlessness.

    The measurement and observation materials are currently being analyzed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on July 4th: Professor Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory near Leningrad, said that the planned launch of the Soviet geophysical rocket carrying animals is a further step on the road to preparing for the launch of manned spacecraft.

    He particularly emphasized that the animals were safely returned to the ground.

    Mikhailov believes that the launch of rockets for exploring the upper atmosphere and cosmic space is a new and significant achievement of Soviet science and technology, and he expresses his deep conviction that this will yield materials that greatly increase human knowledge.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on July 5th: Academician Blagonravov, a prominent Soviet scientist, said that the exploration conducted by the new Soviet geophysical rocket is a preliminary stage in the preparation for human flight, and that this type of exploration will continue and be developed.

    He emphasized that the fact that the puppy "Valiant" completed its fifth space flight proves that the rocket's instruments and animal recovery system are highly reliable. The two dogs and one rabbit, as well as all the instruments, landed intact and undamaged. The animals were in very good condition immediately after landing, and the instruments can be used again.

    在准备发射载人宇宙飞船的道路上迈进一步
    苏联发射高空和宇宙考察火箭
    火箭达到二百多公里高空所载动物安全返回考察计划全部完成
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联在6月间按照计划发射了考察大气高层和宇宙空间的单级弹道火箭。
    火箭发射成功。它达到了预定的二百零八公里的高度。
    科学考察仪器被送到大气高层，仪器和能源以及携带的动物（两只狗和一只兔）共重二千一百公斤。
    动物在着陆后情况良好。其中一条名叫“勇士”的狗在这一次完成了它的第五次宇宙旅行。
    考察计划已全部完成。
    获得了关于观测在很大高度上形成的电离云、关于大气层的离子组成及其带电性质、关于地球和太阳辐射的宝贵材料，并且获得了关于动物在失重情况下的肌肉紧张度的新材料。
    目前正在对测量和观测材料进行分析。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：列宁格勒附近的普尔科沃天文台台长米哈伊洛夫教授说，苏联运载动物的地球物理学火箭按计划的发射，是在通向准备发射载人宇宙飞船的道路上的一个进一步的步骤。
    他特别着重指出，动物被安全地送回了地面。
    米哈伊洛夫认为，考察大气高层和宇宙空间的火箭的发射是苏联科学技术的一个新的巨大成就，他表示深信，由此将会获得一些大大增加人类知识的材料。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联著名科学家布拉冈拉沃夫院士说，苏联新的地球物理火箭所进行的考察，是准备人的飞行的一个先行阶段，这一类考察将继续进行，并加以发展。
    他强调指出，小狗“勇士”完成第五次宇宙飞行一事证明，火箭上的仪器和动物回收系统是高度可靠的。要求回到地面的两只狗和一只兔以及全部仪器都完整无损地着陆了。动物刚一着陆后情况就是十分良好的，仪器还可以再次使用。
