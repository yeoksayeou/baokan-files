    Mao Zedong, the great leader of all our ethnic groups, his theories and works on literature and art are the peak of Marxist-Leninist literary and art theory. Comrade Mao Zedong, using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method combined with the actual situation of Chinese revolutionary literature and art, scientifically formulated for us a complete set of guidelines for systematically developing socialist and communist literature and art. This is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve the victorious development of socialist literature and art in all different regions and among all different ethnic groups.

    Xinjiang is a region where thirteen ethnic groups live together, and each ethnic group has its own long and excellent literary and artistic traditions. Due to imperialist aggression, the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and various historical reasons, the literary and artistic undertakings of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have long been more backward than those in the inland provinces and regions. Due to the ethnic divisions created by the ruling class, the exchange of literature and art among ethnic groups was hindered. Furthermore, due to the imbalanced political and economic development of the ethnic groups, there was an imbalance in the development of their literary and artistic undertakings. These characteristics presented new challenges and special difficulties for us in implementing the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic guidelines and policies, and in building and developing socialist literary and artistic undertakings among multiple ethnic groups. Over the past ten years, we have carried out much arduous work in literature and art and have experienced a series of complex and serious struggles. We deeply realize that as long as we take Mao Zedong's literary and art thought as the guiding ideology for developing the literary and artistic undertakings of all ethnic groups, and as long as we unswervingly implement the Party's literary and artistic guidelines and policies, we will certainly be able to overcome any difficulties left over from history, and we will certainly be able to defeat any attacks from bourgeois ideology and achieve victory.

    **Ten Years of Gradual Prosperity and Growth of Revolutionary Literary and Art Undertakings in Xinjiang**

    In the early days of liberation, the contingent of literary and art workers in Xinjiang numbered only several hundred. Most of them were literary and art troupes and teams from the People's Liberation Army that entered Xinjiang, a portion were revolutionary literary and art workers from the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay, and ethnic minority literary and art workers liberated from the Kuomintang reactionary rule. At that time, the ideological and political situation of this contingent was very complex, and they held a wait-and-see and doubtful attitude towards revolution and revolutionary literature and art. Questions such as "Should literature and art serve proletarian politics?" "Should writers go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers?" and "Can new operas like *The White-Haired Girl* and *Blood and Tears of Hatred* be performed in Xinjiang?" were raised by some people. Over the past ten years, the literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, together with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, have experienced a series of struggles, transformed their thinking, raised their political consciousness, and gradually improved and purified this contingent. Over the past ten years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, they have continuously gone deep into the vast industrial and mining areas, agricultural and pastoral areas, and companies of the Tianshan Mountains, participating in the actual struggles of the people and the earth-shaking land reform, the "one-化三改" (socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce), the people's commune movement, and the production struggles on various fronts. Now, this literary and art contingent has not only grown in number to become a large army of more than 3,000 people from more than ten ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Han, Kazakh, Mongolian, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tajik, Sibe, Tatar, Daur, and 78 professional literary and art groups, but also has made significant progress in politics and professional skills, with rapid advancements in creative ability, professional knowledge, and performance skills. They often brave the severe cold and winds to be active among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many intellectuals from non-laboring people have undergone tests in previous political movements and strict training and self-transformation in the long-term life and struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have gradually been trained to become proletarian literary and art workers. Many workers, peasants, and herdsmen who were deprived of the right to education and learning in the old society have also proudly stepped into the door of literature and art. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many talented folk poets and worker-peasant writers from all ethnic groups have emerged. Furthermore, many veteran cadres with rich revolutionary experience and generals from the army have also joined the ranks of literary and art work. All of this has infused new blood into this contingent, and even ethnic groups that had no written language in the past now have their own writers and poets. Various literary and art groups have been established one after another, and more than 400 writers and artists from all ethnic groups have been admitted as members.

    The formation and development of this multi-ethnic socialist literary and art contingent has led to the creation of many excellent literary and artistic works. These works were created by writers and artists who followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to go deep into, become familiar with, and understand the fiery struggle life of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to learn and master the literary and artistic forms that are loved by the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, these works mostly coordinate with the political tasks of a certain period in content, reflecting the heroic and bold spirit of the working people of all ethnic groups in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and shaping vivid and touching heroic images with communist moral qualities. The forms of these literary and artistic works inherit the traditional literary and artistic forms of various ethnic groups and folk arts, and have been developed and reformed to create a mass style and national style that is loved by the people of all ethnic groups. For example, the Uyghur writer Zulong Khadir's play *Happy Event* reflects the life and spiritual outlook of Uyghur peasants during the agricultural collectivization period, exposes the shameless sabotage of rich peasants, and greatly encourages the peasants' confidence in taking the path of collectivization. The Kazakh writer Hao Wusilihan's novel *Starting Point* reflects the intricate struggles on the path of pastoral collectivization and powerfully criticizes the spontaneous capitalist ideas of the herdsmen. The Han writer Liu Xiaowu has created many short poems and essays to coordinate with the Party's central struggle tasks in each period. The film script *Distant Spark*, which he wrote, reflects the fighting life of Mutalifu, an outstanding son of the Uyghur people and a revolutionary poet. The film script *Hassen and Jamila*, co-created by Han writer Wang Yuhu and ethnic minority writers, and other works such as *Sunshine Shines on the Tianshan Mountains* written by Han writer Bi Ye, and *From a Small Yurt to the Whole World* written by Kazakh poet Kurban Ali, all profoundly reflect the great changes in the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and enthusiastically praise the great achievements of socialist construction in the autonomous region. They and other writers and poets, with their sincere love for the Party and the new life, and with their keen ability to observe life and superb writing skills, have reflected the new life from various aspects. All these writers' works have their own different styles and strong national characteristics, and reflect the common socialist content from various different angles. The formal structure, language, and characters of these works all have the characteristics of their respective ethnic groups. The flourishing literary creation in the autonomous region is like a flower garden with clusters of flowers, some fresh, some fragrant, some elegant, some rich, all kinds of colors, competing for beauty. Because of this, these works are loved by the masses of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and by a large number of readers in the interior. Over the past ten years, five literary journals have been founded successively, including *Tarim* (Uyghur), *Tianshan* (Chinese), *Dawn* (Kazakh), *Morning Star* (Mongolian), and *Oasis* (Chinese) of the Production and Construction Corps. *Literary Translations*, which mainly publishes theoretical articles introducing the Party's literary and art policies and excellent works by famous writers from all over the country in Uyghur, is very popular among Uyghur-speaking readers of all ethnic groups. In addition, popular literary and art publications such as *Xinjiang Pictorial* and *Mass Club* also have a wide and strong influence among the people in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral areas.

    Over the past ten years, the development of the drama cause of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has also been closely linked to the economic and political struggles of the people of all ethnic groups. Those feudal and backward contents have been basically eliminated. What often appears on the stage is the new content reflecting socialist construction and the unity and friendship of all ethnic groups. At the same time as creating new drama content, the reform of the old drama forms has also achieved remarkable results. A new type of ethnic song and dance drama has begun to take shape; Han Chinese operas are increasingly staging modern dramas and dramas about the lives of fraternal ethnic groups. The ethnic song and dance drama *The Course of Fighting* reflects the fighting life of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang from darkness to light, and reflects the struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the assistance and support of the great Han people during the dark rule of the Kuomintang. Thanks to the joint efforts of ethnic minority literary and art workers and Han Chinese literary and art workers, gratifying results have been achieved. The new type of ethnic song and dance drama *Song of Turpan*, jointly created by Han and ethnic minority literary and art workers, reflects the new life of common labor, unity, and friendship among the Han, Uyghur, Hui, and other ethnic groups using realistic themes. Other dramas such as *Ice Peak Eagles*, which uses the art form of Peking Opera to reflect the life of the army, *Pastoral Spring Song*, which uses the form of Ping Opera to reflect the modern life of the Kazakh people, and *Following Chairman Mao Step by Step* and *Red Flags Flying Before the Flaming Mountains*, which use the form of ethnic musical drama to reflect the current ethnic life, are all attempts by literary and art workers of various ethnic groups to reflect the lives of the people of all ethnic groups from various aspects using various different types of drama. This effort has achieved certain results and accumulated necessary experience. The opera *Two Generations*, collectively created and performed by the Urumqi Railway Literary and Art Troupe, not only reflects the common struggle and flesh-and-blood relationship between the Uyghur and Han people in content, showing that under the leadership of the Party, they are building the motherland shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand, but also absorbs the excellent characteristics of many different traditional arts of the Han and Uyghur ethnic groups in artistic form.

    The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are good at singing and dancing. The broad masses of dancers have created new forms of song and dance art with new content of life on the basis of learning from ethnic and folk songs and dances. New ethnic dance dramas have been created by absorbing the artistic techniques of Han and Soviet dances on the basis of ethnic dances. The *Picking Grapes Dance* performed by the Uyghur young actress Ayitula won a gold medal at the 7th World Youth and Student Festival for its healthy and rich life characteristics and unique and beautiful artistic style. Due to historical and religious reasons, ethnic groups whose painting art was extremely underdeveloped in the past have now cultivated painters of their own ethnic groups. The oil painting *Vice Chairman Zhu in the Apple Orchard* by the young painter Abaidulla has been well received.

    Over the past ten years, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on combining popularization with improvement, with the establishment and reform of ethnic minority languages and the widespread development of the literacy campaign, cultural life has been improving day by day, and mass literary and artistic activities have also been greatly developed. Many professional literary and art workers often go to factories and rural areas to conduct mass literary and art guidance work. At the same time, various forms of training classes for amateur literary and art workers and various forms of mass observation and performance meetings are organized to train the backbone forces of amateur literary and art work. Now many industrial and mining enterprises have their own amateur literary and art troupes and teams. There are 2,251 people's commune clubs. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been carrying out various socialist construction undertakings in the spirit of liberating their minds, breaking down superstitions, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. At the same time, mass literary and artistic activities have also developed vigorously, quickly forming a upsurge of great prosperity in culture and art. The literary creation movement, with "poetry contests," "poetry villages," "poetry teams," and "poetry workshops" as the main forms of activity, has been carried out in vast urban and rural areas, industrial and mining areas, and agricultural and pastoral areas. Talented peasant poets Wang Fusen and Maimaitinapuer emerged in the vigorous mass literary creation movement. *The Battle Song of Tianshan*, edited and published by the Propaganda Department of the Production and Construction Corps, is the crystallization of mass creation. These works express the determination of the people of all ethnic groups to unite and build socialism, and change the "poor and blank" face. They embody the spirit of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism. The style of the works is vigorous and fresh, and is familiar and loved by the working people of all ethnic groups. During this period, we are also particularly pleased to see new works by Comrades Guo Peng, Zuo Qi, and Jiakulin. They created excellent works such as *Liu Yasheng*, *Reclaiming Nanniwan*, *Li Disan*, *The Course of Life*, and *Three Brothers*, shaping heroic images shining with the light of communist thought. The Xinjiang Film Studio co-produced the color feature film *Oasis Triumph* last year with the Shanghai Haiyan Film Studio, which was jointly created by professional writers and the masses. This film was listed as one of the outstanding films dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Subsequently, the Xinjiang Film Studio produced 62 news and documentary films (75 episodes) and translated 4 feature films while building the factory, and has now begun to produce feature films.

    Comrade Mao Zedong told us, "We must inherit all excellent literary and artistic heritage, critically absorb all useful things in it, and use it as a reference when creating works from the literary and artistic materials of the people's life at this time and place." Over the past ten years, we have followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to collect, collate, and translate the folk literature and classical music and other literary and artistic heritage of all ethnic groups. The large-scale Uyghur folk classical music *Twelve Muqam* is a precious literary and artistic heritage rescued from the fate of being lost under the guidance of this thought. We have copied the murals of the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves. We have compiled and published the Uyghur folk epics *Elip Senem* and *Rebiya Saidin*, the Kazakh folk epic *Alkalak Hero*, the folk tale *Hero Elikulban*, and folk songs of various ethnic groups. In order to better protect and collect the folk classical literary and artistic heritage of all ethnic groups, we also held a meeting of Aqyns (Kazakh wandering poets) to mobilize them to work with professional literary and art workers to jointly promote the literary and artistic undertakings of the motherland. With the care and help of the Party and the government, many Aqyns have created poems that enthusiastically praise the Party and the new life. The lyrical narrative poems of the herdsman Almatay are as crystal clear, fresh, and moving as the clear spring in the Kazakh pasture.

    The achievements made in all aspects of literary and art work in Xinjiang over the past ten years are unimaginable at any time in history. These historic victories are the result of our firm implementation of the Party's literary and art guidelines and policies, and are the great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in Xinjiang.

    **The Struggle Against Bourgeois Ideology and Local Nationalism on the Literary and Art Front**

    Our implementation of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic guidelines has not been smooth sailing. Like the literary and art circles across the country, we have experienced great storms and serious struggles on the road we have traveled. In these struggles, it was Mao Zedong's literary and art thought that guided and armed us, enabling us to achieve major victories in every struggle. After each struggle, our position was consolidated once, our thinking was tempered once, our contingent became stronger and more powerful, and our literary and art undertakings became more prosperous. Particularly profound was the struggle against rightists and local nationalism that began in 1957 and continued for nearly two years. The rightists and local nationalists in the literary and art field in Xinjiang are not true writers or artists. The reason why they disguise themselves as writers and artists is simply to collude with their like to dominate the literary world and turn literature and art into a bridgehead for their attacks on the Party. Their spearhead is mainly directed at the leadership of the Party and the socialist system. They use the pretext of so-called "taking care of ethnic characteristics," but in essence, they oppose the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings. They falsely accuse works created in conjunction with political tasks of being "calendarism." They disguise themselves as "literary men" and "artists" who "do not care about politics," are "pure" and stand high above the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. But the "literature and art" that they promote and advocate are either works that expose the so-called "dark side" or those that are moaning without illness, "wind and flowers," and even promote vulgar and obscene works of the bourgeoisie. Isn't this very obvious? They oppose literature and art serving politics in words, but in essence, they oppose literature and art serving proletarian politics and want literature and art to serve bourgeois politics. Their target of attack is not only aimed at literature and art itself, but at the Party and the entire socialist system. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, the vast majority of literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang listen to the Party and follow the Party, and are able to distinguish right from wrong. Therefore, once the struggle against rightists and local nationalism is launched, the balance of power is very disparate. All the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists and local nationalists are exposed and completely defeated under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought. This struggle is an epoch-making struggle for literary and art work in Xinjiang, and it is a broad and in-depth decisive battle between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology in the literary and art field in the specific environment of Xinjiang. The victory of this struggle is great, and it has laid a solid foundation and opened up a broad road for us to build socialist literature and art of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. After this struggle, the idea of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is clearer and more firm than ever before, and the contingent of literary and art workers has become stronger and more pure. The broad masses of literary and art workers have gone deep into life and carried out creation, and in a short period of time, a large number of works praising and publicizing the Party's general line and various socialist construction projects have appeared, enthusiastically and vigorously reflecting the new life, new people, and new ideas of the autonomous region. During the Great Steel Smelting, a large number of literary and art workers went to the mountains and engaged in steel production as ordinary laborers. These are the results of the victory of the ideological and political line struggle in the literary and art field, and are the concrete manifestations of the literary and art workers changing their ideological and political outlook.

    The rightists and local nationalists in Xinjiang literary and art circles have also tried every means to undermine the unity of the motherland and attempted to create and provoke relations between ethnic groups. They disguise themselves as loving the literature and art of their own ethnic group, but in essence, they are carrying out activities to undermine the multi-ethnic socialist literature and art of our great motherland. On the one hand, they unrealistically boast and exaggerate the literary and artistic achievements of their own ethnic group, and on the other hand, they extremely rudely belittle and despise the literary and artistic achievements of other ethnic groups, especially the Han Chinese. They try their best to exclude the excellent literature and art of the Han people, hinder the mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual learning of literary and art workers of all ethnic groups, and oppose the absorption of the essence of Han Chinese literature and art to develop the literature and art of ethnic minorities. They use the pretext of the so-called "characteristics of ethnic literature and art" to resist the leadership of the Party. This is the reactionary bourgeois nationalist ideology. Yes, we admit that every ethnic group has its unique cultural art, which is the spiritual wealth created by the working people of an ethnic group through long-term historical life, and is also the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people of an ethnic group in the life practice of fighting against nature and the oppressing classes. Therefore, the literature and art of one's own ethnic group should be respected and seriously inherited and carried forward. However, the formation and development of the culture and art of any ethnic group is not and cannot be in a completely isolated state. It inevitably absorbs the literature and art of other ethnic groups, especially the Han Chinese, and obtains the help of other ethnic groups, especially the Han Chinese. The rightists and local nationalists say that the literature and art of their own ethnic group seem to be perfect and do not need to communicate with the literature and art of any other ethnic group. If it is not a political conspiracy, it is completely a bourgeois metaphysical point of view, which can only make the literature and art of their own ethnic group rigid and suffocated.

    The views and attitudes of the rightists and local nationalists towards the historical and cultural heritage of their own ethnic groups are also wrong. They believe that all the cultural heritage of their own ethnic group should be accepted in its entirety, and if any reform is to be carried out, it is "disrespecting ethnic traditions" and "destroying the ethnic style." We know that in history, all ethnic groups have had progressive literature and art, and also reactionary literature and art; there have been writers who promoted opposition to the ruling class, and there have been writers who obeyed the orders of the ruling class; there have been writers who have worked tirelessly to safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, and there have been writers who have frantically clamored for the creation of national division and the destruction of ethnic unity. We must make a choice between the two. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To clean up the development process of ancient culture, to remove its feudal dross, and to absorb its democratic essence is a necessary condition for developing new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but we must never indiscriminately accept everything." We are following Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to treat the cultures of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    Through the victory of the struggle against rightists and local nationalism, the understanding of the literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang on the great political significance of the unity of the great socialist motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups has become clearer and more profound. In fact, the working people of all our ethnic groups have always been closely related, sharing weal and woe, and have never had any ethnic estrangement in the struggle against class enemies, only class hatred. The so-called ethnic discrimination is created by the ruling class in order to facilitate their class oppression, to divide our forces, and to weaken our fighting spirit. The bourgeois writers and writers in history also arbitrarily forged and distorted the historical truth with their bourgeois historical views and national views. Now, under the brilliant light of the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, the people of all ethnic groups in the country have entered a new era of unprecedented unity, cooperation, and mutual progress among fraternal ethnic groups. This provides our writers and literary and art workers of all ethnic groups with superior conditions for mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual learning. Since liberation for more than ten years, especially after the victory of the struggle against rightists and local nationalism, due to the close mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual learning among literary and art workers of all ethnic groups, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, especially due to the help of Han Chinese literary and art workers to ethnic minority literary and art workers, the development of the literary and art undertakings of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has achieved remarkable achievements. Under the leadership of the Party, Han Chinese writers and ethnic minority writers cooperate in creation, which can not only write works of better quality, but also help ethnic minority writers quickly improve their creative thinking and artistic level. This is also an effective experience. The extensive cooperation of literary and art workers of all ethnic groups has promoted the exchange of literature and art of all ethnic groups, enriched and developed the literary and artistic treasure house of all ethnic groups, and at the same time, has added new wealth to the literature and art of our multi-ethnic socialist motherland.

    The profound understanding of the great political significance of "national unity and ethnic unity" by literary and art workers of all ethnic groups is not only reflected in the cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual learning among literary and art workers of all ethnic groups, but also reflected in the correct reflection of the historical reality of the interdependence and mutual assistance of the people of all ethnic groups in history through their works with the proletarian historical materialism point of view, thus restoring the historical truth that has been distorted, deleted, and buried for many years.

    It is in the course of one struggle after another that a contingent of Marxist literary and art theory criticism of all ethnic groups has been formed. Although it is still a young contingent with a small number of people, it has been tested by the struggle as never before, and it is trying to analyze and guide the current literary and art practice with Marxism. On the literary and art front in Xinjiang, it is a newborn force, and it will play its due role in building socialist literature and art. Naturally, for them, the task is still very arduous, and the theoretical level still needs to be continuously improved.

    **Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought and Advance Victoriously**

    The development process of revolutionary literary and art undertakings in Xinjiang from scratch, from small to large, and from low to high over the past ten years eloquently proves the brilliance and correctness of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. The history of the victorious development of revolutionary literary and art undertakings in Xinjiang is precisely the history of the continuous victory of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in Xinjiang, the history of the victory of our Party's correct line over the wrong line, the victory of the correct policy over the wrong policy, and the victory of the correct thought over the wrong thought, and also the history of the continuous maturity, growth, and consolidation of the proletarian literary and art contingent. The reason why Xinjiang's literary and art work has been able to achieve such great victories is entirely due to the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. This victory has powerfully coordinated with Xinjiang's socialist construction, and at the same time, has laid a solid foundation for the further prosperity and development of Xinjiang's literary and art undertakings.

    However, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out wisely: In our country, "the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce." This makes us realize that after a series of class struggles, Marxism has occupied the main position on the literary and art front, and it is increasingly consolidated and developed. There are some noteworthy gains in literary and art creation and mass literary and art activities. However, we must also see that the struggle between the two ideologies of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in literary and art work is bound to be long-term, tortuous, complex, and sometimes high and sometimes low. In fact, bourgeois ideology and local nationalist ideology have not been completely eliminated, which is what we should pay attention to and seriously guard against. When the political views and philosophical views of the most dangerous enemy in the international communist movement—modern revisionism—are reflected in the literary and art field, we must also hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the literary and art front and wage a resolute struggle against revisionist trends of thought and the ideological tendencies of various bourgeois schools. This ideological tendency is specifically manifested in the fact that some writers still reveal more or less wrong ideological emotions in their creative thinking, some works distort the new socialist life and uglify the heroic image of the people, and some people still treat mass creation with a bourgeois master-style attitude. In our place, there are also works that promote personal happiness, exaggerate the contradiction between collective happiness and personal happiness; there are also works of pessimism, sentimentalism, and decadence caused by the pursuit of bourgeois personal interests to disillusionment; there are also works that pursue human touch from the bourgeois theory of human nature. In addition, in terms of the relationship between literature and art and politics, the issue of political standards and artistic standards, the relationship between writers and life, the issue of whether writers need to transform their thinking, and how to correctly understand and treat the cultural and artistic heritage of all ethnic groups and the motherland, there are still thoughts and remarks that are contrary to Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. All of this does not allow us to ignore it in the slightest, and we must criticize and fight against it in a timely manner. Otherwise, our literary and art undertakings cannot develop healthily, and our literary and art contingent cannot have a strong combat effectiveness.

    In the future, in literary and art work, we must adhere to Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, resolutely implement the Party's literary and art work line and policy, and further develop and improve Xinjiang's literary and art undertakings. To this end:

    First, we must further strengthen, improve, and expand the literary and art contingent, especially in terms of political thought. We must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and better arm our literary and art contingent with Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and guide our literary and art work. At present, this study movement has formed a solid and practical study upsurge that combines theory with practice. We firmly believe that this movement will greatly improve the ideological level of the literary and art circles, improve combat effectiveness, and will inevitably bring about a new situation of unprecedented prosperity in the literary and artistic creation of all ethnic groups.

    Second, we must further enhance the cultural exchange of all ethnic groups and promote the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual learning among literary and art workers of all ethnic groups. The minority ethnic groups in Xinjiang must pay special attention to learning and absorbing the rich literature and art of the Han people in order to develop and improve the literature and art of their own ethnic groups. Whoever does not see this or ignores this is not a true revolutionary literary and art worker. The history of the development of literary and art undertakings in Xinjiang has repeatedly and fully proved this point.

    Third, we must strengthen the political and ideological nature of literature and art, and reflect the atmosphere of our era with a high degree of art, express the new socialist life and the great struggle on the road of socialist construction, express the new spirit of the people of all ethnic groups united, closely united, and bravely advancing under the leadership of the Party, and enthusiastically praise the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, so that our literature and art truly become the Party's sharp weapon for class struggle and a powerful tool for the proletarian dictatorship.

    Fourth, we must further develop various forms and styles of literature and art, so that a lively and lively new situation of a hundred flowers blooming appears on the literary and art front. On the one hand, we must conscientiously explore, transform, and utilize the classical literature and art of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to serve socialism; on the other hand, we must pay attention to vigorously developing modern literature and art in Xinjiang. While further improving the unique level of singing and dancing in Xinjiang, we must quickly overcome the weak links such as literary and artistic creation, opera, and dance drama, so that Xinjiang's literature and art can be fully developed.

    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the literary and art workers of all ethnic groups will unswervingly follow the road of building socialist literature and art formulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong and forge ahead bravely, and we will surely achieve greater victories. The multi-ethnic literature and art of our motherland will surely reach its peak in our era!

    毛泽东文艺思想在新疆的伟大胜利
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记  新疆维吾尔自治区主席  赛福鼎
    我们各民族伟大的领袖毛泽东同志有关文学艺术的理论和著作是马克思列宁主义文艺理论的高峰。毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点与方法结合中国革命文艺的实际，为我们科学地制定了一整套系统地发展社会主义、共产主义文学艺术的方针，这是我们在一切不同地区、一切不同民族获得社会主义文学艺术胜利发展的根本保证。
    新疆是十三个民族聚居的地区，各个民族都有自己悠久而优秀的文学艺术传统。由于帝国主义的侵略，由于国民党反动统治的迫害以及历史上的种种原因，以致新疆各个民族的文学艺术事业长期以来就比内地各省、区落后；由于统治阶级制造的民族隔阂，以致妨碍了各民族文学艺术的交流；又由于各民族政治经济发展的不平衡，以致形成了各民族文学艺术事业发展的不平衡。这些特点，使我们在贯彻执行党和毛泽东同志的文艺方针、政策，在建设和发展多民族的社会主义的文学艺术事业的时候，遇到新的课题和特殊的困难。十年来，我们在文学艺术方面进行了许多艰苦的工作，经历了一系列复杂而严重的斗争。我们深深地体会到，只要以毛泽东文艺思想作为发展各民族文艺事业的指导思想，只要坚定不移地贯彻执行党的文艺方针政策，就一定能够克服任何历史上遗留下来的困难，就一定能够击败资产阶级思想的任何进攻，取得胜利。
    新疆地区革命文艺事业逐渐繁荣壮大的十年
    解放初期，新疆文学艺术工作的队伍仅仅数百人。大多数是随中国人民解放军进驻新疆的部队文工团、队，一部分是伊（犁）、塔（城）、阿（山）三区的革命文艺工作者及从国民党反动统治下解放出来的各民族文艺工作者。在当时，这支队伍的思想政治情况十分复杂，对革命与革命的文艺具有观望和怀疑态度。对“文艺要不要为无产阶级政治服务”，“作家要不要深入工农兵群众的生活”，“《白毛女》、《血泪仇》等新歌剧能不能在新疆演出”，这些问题，都曾有人提出过异议。十年来，新疆各个民族的文艺工作者和新疆各族人民一道经历了一系列的斗争，改造了思想，提高了政治觉悟，逐渐健全和纯洁了这支队伍。十年来，在毛泽东文艺思想指导下，不断地深入天山南北广大工矿、农牧区和连队，参加了人民群众的实际斗争，参加了翻天覆地的土地改革、“一化三改”、人民公社化以及各个战线上的生产斗争。现在，这支文艺队伍不仅在数量上已经发展为拥有维吾尔、汉、哈萨克、蒙古、回、柯尔克孜、乌兹别克、塔吉克、锡伯、塔塔尔、达斡尔等十几个民族的三千多人的大军，七十八个专业文艺团体；而且在政治和业务上也都有明显的提高，创作能力、业务知识和表演技巧都有飞速进步。他们经常冒严寒、顶风雪活跃在广大工农兵中间。有不少出身于非劳动人民的知识分子，在历次政治运动中，在工农兵群众长期的生活与斗争中经受了考验，经受了严格的锻炼与自我改造，逐渐锻炼成为无产阶级的文艺工作者。许多在旧社会被剥夺了受教育、学文化的权利的工、农、牧劳动者，也昂首挺胸地跨进了文学艺术的大门。特别是1958年大跃进以来，涌现出许多各民族的有才华的民间诗人、工农作家。更有许多有丰富革命经验的老干部、部队中的将军也参加了文学艺术工作的行列。这一切都为这支队伍输入了新的血液，就连过去没有文字的民族，现在也有了自己民族的作家和诗人。各种文学艺术团体都先后成立，被吸收为会员的各民族作家、艺术家共达四百多名。
    由于这一支多民族的社会主义的文艺队伍的形成和发展，就产生了许多优秀的文学艺术作品。这些作品是在作家艺术家遵循着毛泽东同志的指示，深入、熟悉和理解了工农兵群众的火热斗争生活，学习和掌握了各族人民所喜闻乐见的文艺形式的基础上进行创作的。因此，这些作品在内容上大都配合了一定时期的政治任务，反映了各民族劳动人民进行社会主义革命与社会主义建设的英勇豪迈的时代精神，塑造了具有共产主义道德品质的生动的感人的英雄形象。这些文艺作品的形式继承了各个民族的、民间的传统文艺形式，又加以发展和改革创造，具有群众风格、民族风格而为各族人民所喜爱。例如维吾尔族作家祖龙哈迪尔的剧本《喜事》，反映了农业合作化时期维吾尔农民的生活与精神面貌，揭露了富农分子的无耻破坏，从而大大鼓舞了农民走合作化道路的信心。哈萨克族作家郝乌斯力汗的小说《起点》则是反映了牧业合作化道路上错综复杂的斗争，有力地抨击了牧民的自发的资本主义思想。汉族作家刘萧芜创作许多短篇诗文，配合了党在每个时期的中心斗争任务，他编写的电影文学剧本《远方星火》，反映了维吾尔族人民优秀的儿子、革命诗人穆太力甫的战斗生活。汉族作家王玉胡和民族作家共同创作的电影文学剧本《哈森与加米拉》等，汉族作家碧野写的《阳光灿烂照天山》，哈萨克族诗人库尔班阿里写的《从小毡房走向全世界》等作品，都深刻地反映了新疆各族人民生活的伟大变革，充满热情地歌颂了自治区社会主义建设的伟大成就。他们和其他作家、诗人都带着对党、对新生活的赤诚热爱，以他们敏锐的洞察生活的能力及精湛的写作技巧从各个方面反映了新生活。所有这些作家的作品又都具有各自不同的风格和强烈的民族特点，从各个不同的角度反映了共同的社会主义内容。这些作品的形式结构、语言人物都有本民族的色彩。自治区文学创作的繁荣景象就像花团锦簇的百花园，有的清新，有的馥郁，有的淡雅，有的浓烈，千红万紫，争芳竞妍。正因为这样，这些作品才得到新疆各族人民群众及内地广大读者的喜爱。十年来先后创办了《塔里木》（维吾尔文）、《天山》（汉文）、《曙光》（哈萨克文）、《启明星》（蒙文）以及生产建设兵团的《绿洲》（汉文）等五种文学期刊。以维文出版介绍党的文艺方针政策的理论文章和全国著名作家优秀作品为主要内容的《文学译丛》，很受各民族维语读者的喜爱。此外，还有《新疆画报》、《群众俱乐部》等通俗文艺刊物，也在工农牧区人民群众中有广泛而强烈的影响。
    十年来，新疆各民族戏剧事业的发展，也是同各族人民在经济、政治上的斗争紧密联系着的。那些封建落后的内容已经基本上被剔除了。在舞台上经常出现的是反映社会主义建设和各民族亲如手足的团结关系的新内容。在创造新的戏剧内容的同时，旧的戏剧形式的改革也收到了显著的成效。新型的民族歌舞剧已经开始形成；汉族的旧有的剧种上演现代的、兄弟民族的生活题材的剧目也不断增加。民族歌舞剧《战斗的历程》反映新疆各族人民从黑暗走向光明的战斗生活、反映在国民党黑暗统治的年代里，新疆各族人民在伟大的汉族人民的援助与支持下所进行的斗争。由于民族文艺工作者和汉族文艺工作者的共同努力，因而获得了可喜的成绩。由汉族和民族文艺工作者合作的新型民族歌舞剧《吐鲁番之歌》，则是用现实题材反映了汉、维、回等各民族共同劳动、团结友爱的新生活。其他如用京剧艺术形式演出的反映部队生活的《冰峰雄鹰》，用评剧形式演出的反映哈萨克族现代生活的《牧区春歌》，用民族音乐话剧形式演出的反映当前民族生活的《步步跟着毛主席》、《火焰山前红旗飘》等剧目，都是各个民族的文艺工作者试图用各个不同的剧种、从各个不同的方面反映各民族人民的生活，这种努力已经取得了一定的效果，也积累了必要的经验。由乌鲁木齐铁路文工团集体创作和演出的歌剧《两代人》，不仅在内容上反映了维汉人民的共同斗争和血肉关系，表现了在党的领导下，肩并肩、手携手地建设祖国；而且在艺术形式方面也吸收了汉族和维族许多不同的传统艺术的优秀特色。
    新疆各民族是能歌善舞的。广大舞蹈工作者在向民族民间歌舞学习的基础上创作了富有新的生活内容的新的歌舞艺术形式。在民族舞蹈的基础上吸收了汉族和苏联舞蹈艺术技巧，创作了新的民族舞剧。维吾尔族青年演员阿衣吐拉表演的《摘葡萄舞》，曾经以她那健康浓郁的生活特色，独特优美的艺术风格，在第七届世界青年与学生联欢节上获得了金质奖章。由于历史和宗教的原因，过去绘画艺术极不发达的民族，现在也培养了自己民族的画家。青年画家阿拜都拉的油画《朱副主席在苹果园》获得了好评。
    十年来，在毛泽东同志关于普及与提高相结合的思想指导下，随着各民族文字的创立改革、扫盲运动的普遍开展，文化生活日益提高，群众性的文艺活动也得到了很大发展。许多专业文艺工作者经常下厂下乡进行群众文艺辅导工作。同时，还组织了各种形式的业余文艺工作者训练班及各种形式的群众的观摩会演，培养业余文艺工作的骨干力量。现在很多工矿企业都有自己的业余文工团、队。人民公社俱乐部已达二千二百五十一个。1958年大跃进以来，新疆各族人民同全国人民一样，在解放思想、破除迷信、发扬敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格进行各项社会主义建设事业的同时，群众性的文艺活动也蓬勃发展起来，很快形成了文化艺术大繁荣的热潮。以“赛诗会”、“诗乡”、“诗队”、“诗车间”为主要活动形式的文艺创作运动在广大城乡、工矿农牧区开展起来。有才华的农民诗人王福森、买买提那波尔就是在轰轰烈烈的群众性文艺创作运动中涌现出来的。生产兵团宣传部编辑出版的《天山战歌》是群众创作的结晶。在这些作品中，表现了各族人民群众团结一致建设社会主义、改变“一穷二白”面貌的雄心大志。它们体现了革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神。作品的风格刚健清新，为各民族劳动人民所熟悉和喜爱。在这个时期，我们还特别高兴地看到郭鹏、左齐、贾库林等同志的新作品。他们创作了《刘亚生》、《屯垦南泥湾》、《李狄三》、《生活的历程》、《三兄弟》等优秀作品，塑造了闪烁着共产主义思想光辉的人物形象。新疆电影制片厂就是在去年同上海海燕电影制片厂合作摄制了专业作家和群众共同创作的彩色故事片《绿洲凯歌》。这部影片被列为向建国十周年献礼的优秀影片之一。随后，新疆电影制片厂就在边建厂边生产的原则下，先后摄制了新闻、纪录片六十二部（七十五本）、翻译故事片四部，现在已经开始摄制故事片了。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，“必须继承一切优秀的文学艺术遗产，批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西，作为我们从此时此地的人民生活中的文学艺术原料创造作品时候的借鉴。”十年来，我们正是遵循着毛泽东同志的这一指示，搜集整理与翻译各民族民间文学和古典乐曲等文学艺术遗产。维吾尔族大型民间古典乐曲《十二木卡姆》，就是在这一思想指导下，从即将失传的厄运中抢救出来的珍贵文艺遗产。我们临摩了黑孜尔千佛洞的壁画。整理出版了维吾尔族民间史诗《艾里甫赛乃姆》、《热碧亚赛丁》，哈萨克族民间史诗《阿勒卡勒克英雄》，民间故事《英雄艾里库尔班》，以及各民族的民歌等。为了更好地保护与搜集各民族民间古典的文艺遗产，我们还召开了阿肯（哈萨克族游唱诗人）会议，动员他们与专业文艺工作者共同努力，繁荣祖国的文学艺术事业。许多阿肯在党和政府的关怀与帮助下，创作了热情歌颂党和新生活的诗篇。牧民阿勒玛太的抒情叙事诗就像哈萨克牧场的清泉一样晶莹清新，明澈动人。
    十年来，新疆地区在文艺工作各个方面取得的成就，是历史上任何一个时期都不能设想的。这些历史性的胜利，是我们坚决执行了党的文艺方针政策的结果，是毛泽东文艺思想在新疆的伟大胜利。
    文艺战线上同资产阶级思想和地方民族主义的斗争
    在我们贯彻执行党和毛泽东同志的文艺方针的时候，并不是一帆风顺的。在我们走过的道路上也正像全国文艺界一样是经历过大的风浪，进行过严重的斗争的。在这一次又一次的斗争中，正是毛泽东文艺思想指引和武装着我们，使我们在每一次斗争中都取得了重大的胜利。经过一次斗争，我们的阵地就得到一次巩固，我们的思想就得到一次锻炼，我们的队伍更加壮大、坚强，我们的文艺事业就更加繁荣昌盛。影响特别深刻的是从1957年开始的、继续将近两年之久的反右派、反地方民族主义的斗争。新疆地区文学艺术方面的右派分子和地方民族主义分子，并不是什么真正的作家、艺术家，他们之所以装扮成作家、艺术家，只不过是为了纠结同类霸占文坛，把文学艺术变成他们向党进攻的桥头堡垒。他们的矛头，主要地指向党的领导和社会主义制度。他们借口所谓“照顾民族特点”，实质上是反对党对文学艺术事业的领导。他们把结合政治任务创作的作品诬之为“日历主义”。他们把自己装扮成“不管政治”的、“清高”的、高踞于工农兵群众之上的“文学家”、“艺术家”。可是他们所推崇和倡导的“文艺”，一种是揭露所谓“黑暗面”的作品，另一种则是那些无病呻吟，“风花雪月”，甚至宣扬资产阶级的庸俗下流的作品。这就不是很明显了吗？他们口头上反对文艺为政治服务，实质上是反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，要文艺为资产阶级政治服务。他们攻击的目标不只对着文艺本身，而是对着党和整个社会主义制度。新疆各民族文艺工作者在党和毛主席的培养与教导之下，绝大多数同志是听党的话，跟着党走，能够明辨是非的，所以反右派、反地方民族主义的斗争一经发动，力量对比就非常悬殊。右派分子、地方民族主义分子的一切阴谋诡计，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀之下，暴露无遗，彻底失败了。这一斗争，对新疆文艺工作来说，是个划时代的斗争，是资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想在文艺领域，在新疆这个具体环境展开的一次广泛而深入的决战。这个斗争的胜利是伟大的，给我们在新疆建设各个民族的社会主义文学艺术打下了一个坚实的基础，开辟了一条广阔的道路。经过这一斗争，文艺为工农兵服务的思想比以往任何时候都更加明确也更加坚定了，文艺工作者的队伍更加壮大、更加纯洁了。广大文艺工作者深入生活、进行创作，在很短的时间内就出现了大量歌颂和宣传党的总路线和各项社会主义建设的作品，热情洋溢、生气勃勃地反映了自治区的新生活、新人物和新思想。在大炼钢铁时，大批文艺工作者上了山，以一个普通劳动者的身份投入了钢铁生产的劳动行列。这都是文艺领域思想战线、政治战线上斗争胜利的成果，是文艺工作者改变了思想政治面貌的具体表现。
    新疆文艺界的右派分子、地方民族主义分子还千方百计地破坏祖国统一，妄图制造与挑拨各民族之间的关系。他们装扮成酷爱本民族文学艺术的样子，实质上是进行破坏我们伟大祖国的多民族的社会主义文学艺术的勾当。他们一方面不切实际地吹嘘夸大本民族的文学艺术成就，一方面又极其粗暴地贬低和鄙视其他民族特别是汉民族的文学艺术的成就。他们极力排斥汉族人民优秀的文艺，阻碍各族文艺工作者互助合作，互相学习，反对吸取汉族文艺精华来发展少数民族文艺，他们借口所谓“民族文学艺术的特点”来抗拒党的领导。这是反动的资产阶级民族主义的思想。是的，我们承认任何一个民族都具有它独具风采的文化艺术，这是一个民族劳动人民在长期的历史生活中辛勤创造的精神财富，也是一个民族劳动人民在向大自然和压迫阶级进行斗争的生活实践中的智慧的结晶。所以对自己民族的文学艺术，应该尊重，应该认真地继承和发扬。可是，任何一个民族的文化艺术的形成和发展，并不是也不可能是处于完全孤立的状态，它不可避免地要吸收其他民族特别是汉族人民的文艺、取得其他民族特别是汉族人民的帮助。右派分子、地方民族主义分子把自己民族的文艺说得似乎已经尽善尽美，绝不需要和任何其他民族的文学艺术交流，如果不是一种政治阴谋的话，也完全是资产阶级形而上学的观点，只能使自己民族的文学艺术僵化窒死。
    右派分子、地方民族主义分子对待本民族的历史文化遗产的观点和态度也是错误的。他们认为凡是本民族的文化遗产就应该全盘接受，如果要进行丝毫改革，那就是“不尊重民族传统”、“破坏了民族风格”。我们知道，在历史上各民族都有过进步的文学艺术，也有过反动的文学艺术；有过宣传反对统治阶级的作家，也有过唯统治阶级之命是从的作家；有过为维护祖国统一和民族团结而不懈奋斗的作家，也有过制造祖国分裂、破坏民族团结而疯狂叫嚣的作家。在这两者之间，我们必须有所抉择。毛泽东同志说：“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。”我们正是遵循着毛泽东同志的指示，来对待新疆各民族的文化的。
    通过反右、反地方民族主义斗争的胜利，新疆各族文艺工作者对伟大社会主义祖国的统一和各民族的团结一致的重大政治意义的认识，更加明确、更加深刻了。事实上，我们各个民族劳动人民从来就是痛痒相关、休戚与共的，从来就是和阶级敌人作斗争时只有阶级仇恨而没有什么民族隔阂的。所谓民族歧视是统治阶级为了有利于他们进行阶级压迫、为了分化我们的力量，削弱我们的斗志而造成的。历史上那些资产阶级的文人、作家也就用他们资产阶级的历史观、民族观肆意地伪造和歪曲了历史的真实。现在，全国各民族人民在党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，跨入了一个兄弟民族空前团结，携手共进的新时代。这就为我们各民族作家、文艺工作者提供了互助合作、互相学习的优越条件。解放十余年来，特别是反右派、反地方民族主义斗争取得胜利以后，由于各民族文艺工作者亲密无间的互助合作、互相学习，取长补短、各尽所能，特别是由于汉族文艺工作者对民族文艺工作者的帮助，因而使新疆各民族的文学艺术事业的发展获得了显著成就。在党的领导下，汉族作家和民族作家合作进行创作，不仅能够写出质量较好的作品，而且帮助民族作家能够很快地提高创作思想和艺术水平，这也是行之有效的一条经验。各民族文艺工作者的广泛合作促进了各民族文学艺术的交流，丰富和发展了各民族的文学艺术宝库，同时，也为我们多民族的社会主义祖国的文学艺术增加了新的财富。
    各民族文艺工作者对“祖国统一、民族团结”的伟大政治意义的深刻认识，还不仅表现在各个民族文艺工作者本身的合作互助和互相学习，而且表现在通过他们的作品以无产阶级历史唯物主义的观点，正确反映了历史上各个民族人民之间的唇齿相依、同舟共济的历史现实，从而恢复了多少年来被歪曲、被删改、被埋没了的历史的真实面目。
    正是在一次又一次的斗争中，一支各民族自己的马克思主义的文艺理论批评队伍形成起来了。虽然它还是一支年轻的人数不多的队伍，但它前所未有地经受了斗争的考验，试图用马克思主义分析与指导当前的文学艺术实践，在新疆文学艺术战线上，它是一支新生的力量，对建设社会主义文学艺术是会起到它应有的作用的。自然，对他们来说，任务还是非常艰巨的，理论水平还有待于继续不断地提高。
    高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗乘胜前进
    十年来，新疆的革命文艺事业从无到有、从小到大、从低到高的发展过程，雄辩地证明了毛泽东文艺思想的英明、正确。新疆革命文艺事业胜利发展的历史，正是毛泽东文艺思想在新疆不断取得胜利的历史，是我们党的正确路线战胜错误路线、正确方针战胜错误方针、正确思想战胜错误思想的斗争的历史，也是无产阶级文艺队伍不断成熟、壮大和巩固的历史。新疆的文艺工作上所以能够取得如此重大的胜利，这完全归功于党和毛泽东同志的英明领导。这一胜利有力地配合了新疆社会主义建设，同时为新疆文艺事业的进一步繁荣、发展奠定了稳固的基础。
    但是，正如毛泽东同志所英明指出的：在我国“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”这就使我们认识到，经过一系列的阶级斗争之后，马克思主义思想在文学艺术战线上已经占领了主要阵地，并且日益巩固和发展，在文学艺术创作和群众文艺活动方面都有了一些值得重视的收获。但也不能不看到在文学艺术工作中无产阶级与资产阶级两种思想的斗争还必然是长期存在、曲折复杂、时高时低的。事实上，资产阶级思想和地方民族主义思想并没有彻底肃清，这是我们应该重视和严重警惕的。当国际共产主义运动中最危险的敌人——现代修正主义的政治观点与哲学观点在文学艺术领域有所反映的时候，我们在文艺战线上也必须高举毛泽东思想红旗，同修正主义思潮以及形形色色资产阶级流派的思想倾向进行坚决的斗争。这种思想倾向具体表现在有的作家在创作思想上还或多或少流露出错误的思想情绪，有的作品歪曲了社会主义新生活、丑化了人民群众的英雄形象，有的人还以资产阶级老爷式的态度对待群众创作。在我们这里也不是没有那些宣传个人幸福、夸大集体幸福与个人幸福之间的矛盾的作品；不是没有从资产阶级的个人利益的追求到幻灭而产生的悲观主义、感伤主义、颓废主义的作品；不是没有从资产阶级人性论出发追求人情味的作品。此外，在文艺与政治的关系、政治标准与艺术标准的问题方面，在作家与生活的关系、作家需不需要改造思想的问题方面，以及如何正确认识和对待各民族和祖国的文化艺术遗产方面，都还存在同毛泽东文艺思想相违背的思想和言论，这一切都不容许我们丝毫有所忽视，都必须及时进行批判和斗争。不这样，我们的文学艺术事业就不能健康地发展，我们文学艺术队伍就不能具有坚强的战斗力。
    今后，在文艺工作上，我们必须坚持毛泽东文艺思想，坚决贯彻执行党的文艺工作路线和方针，使新疆文艺事业得到进一步发展和提高。为此：
    首先，必须进一步加强、提高和壮大文艺队伍，特别是在政治思想方面，要认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志著作，以毛泽东文艺思想更好地武装我们的文艺队伍，指导我们的文艺工作。目前，这个学习运动已经形成了一个扎扎实实的、理论联系实际的学习高潮。我们坚信，这个运动，势将大大提高文艺界的思想水平，提高战斗力，也必将出现一个各民族文学艺术创作空前繁荣昌盛的新局面。
    其次，必须进一步增强各民族文化交流，促进各民族文艺工作者互助合作、互相学习的关系。新疆的各少数民族更要特别重视学习和吸收汉族人民丰富的文艺，借以发展和提高本民族的文艺。谁要是看不到这一点或者忽视这一点，他就不是一个真正的革命文艺工作者，新疆文艺事业发展的历史反复地、充分地证明了这一点。
    第三，必须加强文艺的政治性和思想性，要以高度的艺术反映我们这个时代的气息，表现新的社会主义生活和社会主义建设道路上的伟大斗争，表现各族人民在党的领导下团结一致，亲密无间、奋勇前进的新面貌，热情歌颂总路线、大跃进和人民公社，使我们的文艺真正成为党进行阶级斗争的锐利武器，成为无产阶级专政的有力工具。
    第四，要进一步发展各种形式、各种风格的文艺，使文艺战线上出现一个生动活泼、百花争艳的新局面。一方面要认真挖掘和改造利用新疆各民族的古典文艺，使它为社会主义服务；另一方面更要重视大力发展新疆现代文艺，在进一步提高新疆所特有的歌舞水平的同时，要迅速克服文艺创作、歌剧、舞剧等薄弱环节，使新疆文艺得到全面的发展。
    我们坚信在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，各个民族的文艺工作者坚定不移地遵循党和毛泽东同志制定的建设社会主义文学艺术的道路奋勇前进，我们必能取得更大的胜利。我们祖国的多民族的文学艺术必将在我们的时代里出现高峰！
