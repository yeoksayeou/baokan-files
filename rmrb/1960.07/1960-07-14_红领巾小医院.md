　　Red Scarf Little Hospital
　　The primary school students of Chongqing Zhongyi Road Primary School have established a "Red Scarf Little Hospital." The staff of the small hospital are all children around ten years old.
　　A small emergency bed covered with a clean white sheet, a long small table in front of the window, and simple medical equipment and medicines in a low glass cabinet, with certificates of merit and thank-you notes written in various handwriting posted on the wall. The "waiting area" at the entrance is a row of small benches. This is everything in the "Red Scarf Little Hospital."
　　The class bell rang. The little medical staff began to get busy. The little director is not very tall, but he is so careful and responsible when diagnosing illnesses, registering the condition on the medical record, and then, holding a cotton swab, he squats down and carefully applies mercurochrome to a first-grade student.
　　The main task of this small hospital is to instill hygiene knowledge in students, promote the elimination of the four pests and emphasize hygiene, and teach how to prevent diseases, etc.

　　红领巾小医院
　  重庆中一路小学的小学生，办了一个“红领巾小医院。”小医院的工作人员都只是十来岁的孩子。
    一张铺着洁白床单的急救小床，窗前长长的小桌上和矮矮玻璃橱内，放着一些简单的医疗用具和药品，墙上贴着奖状和用各种字迹写的感谢信，进门“候诊处”是一排小小的长凳。这就是“红领巾小医院”的一切。
    下课铃声响了。小医务人员们开始忙碌起来。小院长个子不大，诊病时那么细心负责，把病情登记上病历表，然后，拿着消毒棉花蹲下身子，给一个一年级小同学小心地涂上红药水。
    这个小医院的主要任务是向同学灌输卫生知识，宣传除四害讲卫生，怎样防止疾病等。
