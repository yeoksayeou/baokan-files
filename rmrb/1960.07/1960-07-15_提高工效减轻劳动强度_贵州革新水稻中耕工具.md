Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 14th. Encouraged by the success in manufacturing, popularizing, and using rice transplanters, rural people's communes in various parts of the Guizhou Plateau have launched a new upsurge in innovating, manufacturing, popularizing, and using cultivation tools, primarily weeding rakes, to complete the entire process of rice cultivation tool innovation. By the end of June, the province had promoted and used more than 1.8 million pieces of equipment, including weeding rakes, fertilizer applicators, insecticide applicators, and water lifting tools.

At all levels, Party organizations began to focus on the reform of cultivation tools when the manufacturing of rice transplanters was nearing completion. The Anshun Special District, after mobilizing the masses to summarize and promote the experience of rice transplanters, realistically formulated a reform plan for cultivation tools. Party secretaries and cadres took the lead in using them, summarized experiences, and completed the manufacturing task of more than 300,000 weeding machines ahead of schedule by about half a month through promotion activities of "competing if unconvinced, watching if not understanding, and learning if unable." More than 100,000 rice transplanter operators in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, after putting down their rice transplanters, carried weeding rakes, learned while working, and quickly became skilled weeding experts. The original more than 12,000 specialized rice transplanting teams quickly became specialized weeding teams and made great achievements. Commune members happily sang: "In the past, weeding made our backs ache, now weeding is easy, we can weed four or five mu a day, and finish before sunset."

In the reform of cultivation tools, most areas adopted the method of manufacturing, testing, and appraising simultaneously. As soon as a tool was made, it was taken to the masses for field appraisal and improved according to the users' opinions. The Qinggangpo Commune in Sinan County specifically held a weeding competition to select weeding tools with high efficiency and good quality. In the province, the cultivation tools that have been appraised well by the masses in field operations include more than ten types of weeding rakes, such as the cow-comb type and the shuttle-shaped boat-bottom roller type, which are manufactured and promoted locally according to specific conditions. These types of weeding tools are mostly bamboo and wood structures, with the characteristics of simple manufacturing, light and flexible, low cost, high efficiency, deep weeding, and clean weeding. Generally, one person can weed three to four mu a day, and skilled workers can weed about seven mu. At the same time, it basically solves the difficulties of the high labor intensity and inconvenient movement of bending over to weed with hands and feet. Luowan Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City used new-style cultivation tools for weeding, transporting fertilizer, applying fertilizer, irrigating, and pest control, making the rice field management machinery complete and improving work efficiency.

### 提高工效减轻劳动强度　贵州革新水稻中耕工具

　　提高工效减轻劳动强度
　　贵州革新水稻中耕工具
    据新华社贵阳14日电　贵州高原各地农村人民公社，在制造、推广、使用插秧机胜利的鼓舞下，又掀起了革新、制造、推广、使用以薅秧耙为主的中耕工具热潮，要使水稻耕作工具的革新成龙。到6月底止，全省已推广使用薅秧耙、追肥器、杀虫器和提水工具等共一百八十多万件。
    各级党组织在制造插秧机接近扫尾时，就开始抓中耕工具的改革工作。安顺专区在发动群众总结推广插秧机的经验的基础上，踏踏实实地制订了中耕工具改革规划，党委书记、干部首先带头使用，总结经验，并通过“不服就比、不懂就看、不会就学”的推广活动，提前半月左右完成了三十多万件薅秧机具的制造任务。黔南布依族苗族自治州十万多名插秧机手，在放下插秧机后，都扛起了薅秧耙，边干边学，很快就成为熟练的薅秧能手。原来的一万二千多个插秧专业队伍，迅速地变为薅秧专业队，并作出了很大的成绩。社员高兴地唱着：“过去薅秧腰酸痛，如今薅秧好轻松，一天能薅四五亩，太阳未落就收工。”
    在改革中耕工具中，大部分地区采取边制造边试验边鉴定的办法，制出一件，就拿到群众中去进行田间鉴定，并根据群众的使用意见改进提高。思南县青杠坡公社专门召开了薅秧比试大会，评选出工效高、质量好的薅秧工具。全省经群众田间操作鉴定较好的中耕工具，仅薅秧耙就有牛蓖子式、梭形船底滚筒式等十多种类型，各地都因地制宜进行制造推广。这些类型薅秧工具大都是竹木结构，具备了制造简单、轻便灵活、成本低、工效高、薅得深、薅得净等特点。一般一人一天可薅三至四亩，熟手可薅七亩左右。同时也基本上解决了弯腰曲背手脚薅秧劳动强度大、行进不便的困难。贵阳市郊洛湾公社从薅秧、运肥、追肥、灌溉到防虫，全部使用了新式中耕工具，使水稻田间管理机具配套成龙，提高了工效。
