Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The "Skillful Farming" movement in Chuansha County, Shanghai, has expanded the sown area of crops in a short period to more than one-tenth of the original total cultivated land area. The multiple cropping index has also been greatly improved, thus making fuller use of the county's land.

Chuansha County, with its large population and limited land, launched the "Skillful Farming" movement throughout the county before the summer harvest and planting were even completed, in order to increase the production of grain, cotton, vegetables, and fruits. Feng Rentang, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, took the lead in going deep into a production team to inspect the fields and find gaps with grassroots cadres, mobilizing the masses to skillfully plant ten mu of rice on barren roadsides, ditches, and shallow river beaches. Party committees at all levels also personally set examples, making the county's "Skillful Farming" movement quickly reach a climax.

The "Skillful Farming" movement in this county has progressed from "seizing every opportunity" to "creating opportunities," step by step becoming more in-depth. After the communes utilized the existing gaps that had been planted in the past, they formed professional teams to find new gaps, planting them as soon as they were found. The gaps that the communes found, which were usually unnoticed, all exceeded one hundred mu. The communes' professional teams then widely carried out "creating opportunities." They filled in abandoned ditches, built small dikes to utilize river beaches, and planted rice, soybeans, and castor beans on the slopes of canals. They also built sheds along the irrigation canals, planting luffa, cowpeas, hyacinth beans, and other climbing crops at the base of the sheds, allowing them to develop towards the space above the canals. Now, the crisscrossing irrigation canals within the county and the sides of more than one hundred kilometers of railways, highways, and sea dikes have been widely planted with melons, beans, sorghum, and corn, and many "bumper harvest roads" and "treasure-filled canals" have emerged.

In the "Skillful Farming" movement, the county also widely summarized the experience of planting gaps and intercropping and companion planting in large fields over the years, using it to guide this year's planting.

Currently, the county is seizing the season to carry out a final push to plant scattered gaps and intercrop and companion plant in large fields, while also organizing manpower to strengthen the field management of the planted crops. Due to meticulous management, the foxtail millet interplanted in cotton fields and the sorghum, corn, melons, and beans planted earlier along ditches, roadsides, canals, and field ridges are all thriving and lush green.

### 上海川沙县“巧种田”运动步步深入

    上海川沙县“巧种田”运动步步深入
    据新华社上海电　上海市川沙县开展“巧种田”运动，短期内扩大的作物播种面积相当于原有总耕地面积十分之一以上，复种指数也大大提高，全县土地因而得到了更充分的利用。
    人多地少的川沙县，为了增产更多的粮、棉、菜、果，今年夏收夏种还未结束，就在全县范围内开展“巧种田”运动。县委第一书记冯仁堂带头深入一个生产队，同基层干部一起踏田头、找隙地，发动群众利用荒路沟、浅河滩巧种了十亩水稻。各级党委也随着亲自动手树立榜样，使全县“巧种田”运动迅速掀起高潮。
    这个县的“巧种田”运动，由“见缝插针”到“找缝插针”，很快又发展到“造缝插针”，一步比一步深入。各公社在把成块的、过去曾经种过的隙地利用起来以后，就组成寻找新隙地的专业队伍，找到一块抢种一块。各公社找到的平时不被人注意的隙地都在百亩以上。公社的专业队伍随后又广泛进行“造缝插针”。他们填平废沟，筑小堤利用河滩，以及在渠道斜坡上种植水稻、黄豆、蓖麻；还在渠道水边搭起棚架，棚脚种植丝瓜、豇豆、刀豆等爬藤作物，让它们向渠道顶上的空间发展。现在，县境内纵横交错的灌溉渠道和一百多公里长的铁路、公路、海堤两旁，已经普遍种上瓜豆、高粱、玉米，并且出现了许多“丰产路”、“万宝渠”。
    这个县在“巧种田”运动中，还广泛总结了历年种植隙地和在大田夹种、套种的经验，用来指导今年的种植。
    目前，全县正一面抓紧季节在突击种植最后一批零星隙地和大田夹种、套种，一面组织人力加强已种作物的田间管理。由于管理细致，棉田里夹种的粟子和沟边、路边、渠道旁、田埂上种植较早的高粱、玉米、瓜豆等作物，都已欣欣向荣，一片葱绿。
