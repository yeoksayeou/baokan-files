Learn Humbly, Never Be Complacent
Lu Lianquan, Worker of Shanxi Machine Tool Factory

    In the past six months, with the help of the leadership and the joint efforts of all comrades in the workshop, I have successfully researched and developed more than 600 technical innovation projects, completing seven years and ten months of work. In the process of innovating these technologies, I deeply realized that to continuously revolutionize, one must never be satisfied with the achievements already made, and especially pay attention to humbly learning from the advanced experiences of others, constantly enriching one's own knowledge, in order to advance without stopping. For example, the scribing machine I successfully created initially increased work efficiency tenfold, but the labor intensity of the workers was not reduced, and the machine still relied on manual cranking. I then worked with everyone to study and change the manual cranking to control by electric buttons, and the efficiency increased by another fifteen times. But after a careful study, there were still many places that needed to be reformed in this automatic scribing machine. For example, measuring dimensions still had to be done manually. After we changed it to be controlled by a ruler, this machine became more perfect than before.

    In order to continuously achieve new results, I paid great attention to learning from the advanced experiences of others, and would not easily let go of even a little bit of merit. In March of this year, I heard that a master in the Sixth Workshop of Jinxi Machine Factory had successfully created a "Universal Scribing Instrument," so I went to learn from him immediately. After returning, I made some modifications based on the actual needs of my own production. Now this universal scribing instrument has begun trial production. After the trial production is successful, the center line, angle line, dimensions, etc. can be scribed out simultaneously in one go.

    Learning and promoting the advanced experience of brother units is not about moving other people's things over as they are, and using them without modification. Because other people's experience is based on their own needs, not specifically for us. When promoting it, it is necessary to modify and supplement it based on the original foundation, according to one's own needs and combined with the actual production, so that it suits one's own needs. Only in this way can advanced experience blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

    The innovation achievements made in the first half of the year have inspired my confidence in continued leaps forward. In the second half of the year, I will definitely muster greater enthusiasm and make more contributions in technical innovation. I have revised my original plan to complete eight years of work through technical innovation this year, to completing more work than eight years through innovation by the end of the year. I believe that as long as I constantly use the thought of continuous revolution to spur myself on, learn humbly, and never be complacent, this plan will definitely be realized.

### 虚心学习　永不自满

    虚心学习　永不自满
    山西机床厂工人　卢连泉
    这半年来，我在领导的帮助下，和全车间的同志共同努力，研究成功了六百多项技术革新项目，完成了七年零十个月的工作量。在革新这些技术的过程中，我深深体会到要不断革命，要永远不满足已取得的成就，特别是要注意虚心学习别人的先进经验，不断丰富自己的知识，才能不停止的前进。例如，我创造成功的划线机，最初工作效率提高了十倍，但是工人的劳动强度并没有减轻，机器还是靠手来摇动。我又和大家共同研究，使手摇改成用电钮来控制，效率又提高了十五倍。但是再一仔细研究，这种自动划线机需要改革的地方还很多。如量尺寸还得用手工量，我们把它改成用标尺来控制以后，这部机器就比过去更完善了。
    为了不断取得新成绩，我很注意学习别人的先进经验，那怕只有一点点可取之处，也不轻易放过。今年3月，我听说晋西机器厂六车间有位师傅创造成功了一种“万能划线仪”，就马上去取经，回来后，又根据自己生产的实际需要，进行了某些修改，现在这种万能划线仪已经开始试制；试制成功后，一次就可以把中心线、解度线、尺寸等同时划出。
    学习推广兄弟单位的先进经验，不是将人家的东西原封不动地搬来，不加修改的就用。因为人家的经验是按照人家自己的需要搞的，不是为咱专门搞的，在推广时，就需要在原有的基础上，根据自己的需要，结合生产实际再修改再补充，使其适合自己的需要。这样才能使先进经验到处开花结果。
    上半年已取得的革新成就，鼓舞着我持续跃进的信心。下半年，我一定要鼓足更大的干劲，在技术革新方面做出更多的贡献来。我已把原来今年通过技术革新完成八年工作量的奋斗计划，修定为到年底通过革新完成比八年更多的工作量。我相信，只要经常用不断革命的思想鞭策自己，虚心学习，永不自满，这个计划是一定能够实现的。
