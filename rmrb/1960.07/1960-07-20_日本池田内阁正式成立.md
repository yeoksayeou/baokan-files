According to Kyodo News, out of the twenty cabinet members, the Ikeda faction occupies six seats, the Kishi Nobusuke faction occupies five, the Sato (Kishi Nobusuke's younger brother) faction occupies two, the Ishii faction occupies two, and the Ohno faction occupies two.

The new Foreign Minister is Zentarō Kosaka, an advisor to the Shin-Etsu Chemical Company. Kosaka belongs to the Ikeda faction and served as Labor Minister in the Yoshida Cabinet.

The Minister of International Trade and Industry is Mitsujiro Ishii, the head of the Ishii faction. The Labor Minister is Hirohide Ishida, who also served as Labor Minister in the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

Iwao Yamazaki, the pre-war Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, has been appointed as the Minister of Autonomy and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission in the new cabinet.

Masumi Ezaki, the former Vice-Minister of Construction in the Yoshida Cabinet, has been appointed as Director-General of the "Defense Agency."

The Ikeda Cabinet held its first cabinet meeting this morning. Afterwards, the new Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda held his first press conference, where he gave a statement on the new cabinet's policies. He said that the "fundamental principle of his cabinet's foreign policy is not to adopt a neutral policy, but to join hands with the free world."

He also said: Improving relations with China is important, but further developing Japan's ties with the "free world" is even more important. He said that regarding Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union, "it is necessary [for Japan] to become a country that is respected and not bullied."

When asked when he would dissolve the Diet to hold a general election, Ikeda declined to specify the date of dissolution.

Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka said at a press conference: "Regarding Japan's foreign policy issues, we will adhere to the liberalist stance as in the past and cooperate with the United States and liberalist countries." He emphasized the need to "restore Japan's international credibility, which has been damaged recently." He also said:
	“First of all, it is necessary to stabilize the situation in Japan. It is also necessary to improve relations with communist countries.”
