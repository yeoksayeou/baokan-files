    A Paean to Mao Zedong Thought
    ——After Watching the Drama "Red Heart of Loyalty"
    Wu Kejian

    I watched the Hunan Provincial Drama Troupe's performance of "Red Heart of Loyalty" with joyful feelings, and I felt as if I had been placed back in this struggle, sharing the same breath and pulse with the fighting comrades, cheering together for the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

    On April 12, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary coup in Shanghai and other places, wantonly massacring workers, suppressing peasants, and attacking the Communist Party. Xu Kexiang, with only one regiment, on the night of May 21, beat and killed union, peasant association, and Communist Party cadres and masses. Overnight, white terror shrouded the provincial capital of Changsha. This is the famous "May 21st Incident" in history. At that time, the right-leaning opportunist leadership within the Communist Party, headed by Chen Duxiu, refused to accept the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, abandoned the leadership of the proletariat, rejected the land demands and armed struggle of the peasants, and did not believe that the strength of the workers and peasants could repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Chen Duxiu and other capitulationists, in order to accommodate the Kuomintang, were willing to abandon the peasants, the most important ally, leaving the working class and the Communist Party isolated and helpless. Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang took advantage of this weakness to launch a mutiny. However, the incident did not develop along the lines of the capitulationists, but advanced according to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong's correct thought, and the famous "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" published by Comrade Mao Zedong at that time, had a huge impact on party members and the masses. The August 7th meeting of the Party Central Committee in 1927 was adapted to this situation, liquidated the mistakes of the right-leaning opportunist leadership of Chen Duxiu and others, and saved the revolution at a critical juncture.

    The drama "Red Heart of Loyalty" is set against the background of the aforementioned turbulent era. The revolutionary comrades and masses in Yangjiachong, Liuyang, Hunan, where the story takes place, were not afraid of any difficulty, and they would rather die than bow to difficulties, resolutely standing on the side of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly holding the red flag, boldly mobilizing the masses to fight local tyrants, distribute land, and take up swords and guns to resolutely fight back against Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. At the same time, they resolutely struggled against the Chen Duxiu opportunist elements within the party. After persuasion and struggle, when they still refused to repent, they resolutely expelled them from the party, thus turning the struggle from danger to safety, from defeat to victory, demonstrating that Mao Zedong Thought is victory. This fully demonstrates the leading ideology of the script, with clear distinctions between the enemy and ourselves, clear rights and wrongs, and a high degree of ideological clarity. The performance of the drama, coinciding with the opposition to modern revisionism internationally and the enthusiastic study of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong by the whole party and the whole people, has even more profound and realistic educational significance.

    At the beginning of the drama, the ferocious faces of the enemy are exposed to the audience. In the dark night sky, with the sounds of running, cursing, and crying mixed into a terrifying cacophony, innocent and kind people are killed, and even the babies in the arms of women are not spared! Blood dyed the hillside red, and flames burned down the peasant association. The local tyrant Yang Shanren pointed and gesticulated, claiming, "Those who put a tall hat on me and paraded me through the village that day, catch them and kill their entire families!" This is the epitome of Chiang Kai-shek's "April 12th" massacre! How can these bloody hands of the reactionaries, exposing the essence of their hatred for the people, not arouse the audience to clench their fists and grind their teeth in hatred!

    Two roads were placed before the revolutionary ranks: surrender meant death, and resistance meant life. There was no third option. Zhao Hong, who embodied Mao Zedong's thought, and Liu Tianyou, who embodied Chen Duxiu's capitulationist thought, launched a clear struggle from the very beginning. Liu Tianyou was frightened by the white terror from the outset, saying things like, "The current situation is that the enemy is strong and we are weak. If we are not careful, won't we provoke them and bring trouble upon ourselves?" Zhao Hong resolutely advocated: "Immediately organize the peasant self-defense army, take up arms and fight the enemy!" He replied to Liu Tianyou: "Tigers are going to eat people anyway. Even if you don't provoke them, they won't let you go." What a clear contrast! Facts prove the correctness of this argument. When Zhao Hong stood sadly beside the corpses of Mother Duan and the masses who had been killed by the enemy, calling for "organizing a peasant self-defense army and taking up arms to fight them," the heroic images of Zhao Hong, Duan Hu, Hong Gu, and Gu Yunlong aroused great satisfaction in the audience. They wiped away their tears, stepped over the blood of the dead, turned grief into strength, and said in unison: "Those who belong to the tiger, stand up and work together!" "Let's organize a peasant self-defense army, forever follow the Communist Party, and resolutely defeat the reactionaries!" Zhao Hong walked in front, Duan Hu waved the red flag, and everyone marched heroically and spiritedly to Leopard Ridge! How resolute, brave, and decisive are the actions of these heroic positive characters in the play, how fearless of difficulties, and how full of confidence in the victory of the revolution are they portrayed.

    The struggle between the two lines continued to unfold sharply after going up the mountain. The stomach needs to be fed, and the enemy needs to be eliminated. This can only be solved by mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and carrying out the struggle against the enemy. Zhao Hong grasped the key to the problem, making earthen cannons, training soldiers, and adhering to the principle of "Open the three buildings of the Yang family, and there is no need to worry about food and guns." But in Liu Tianyou's view, this was "joking" and "absurd." Faced with a white paper with black words from the enemy, he was afraid to go down the mountain to mobilize the masses. Instead, he quoted scriptures and produced parliamentary "theories," wanting to use dogma to scare people. Zhao Hong righteously and sternly said: "The main form of struggle is armed struggle with knives against knives and guns against guns!" "Revolution is a violent action of one class overthrowing another class. If it weren't like this, how could we overthrow the landlords' power that has been deeply rooted for thousands of years?" A few words, tit-for-tat, refuted the right-leaning opportunists, highly embodying the clarity of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The sharp ideological struggle gradually entered a climax as the plot of the play progressed. After opening the granaries and distributing grain and killing the local tyrant, Liu Tianyou sadly cried out "It's terrible!" and shamelessly said that "the revolution at this stage should be led by the Kuomintang." Zhao Hong scolded him "This is betrayal!" These few dialogues powerfully reflect the fundamental issue of revolutionary leadership and show the fundamental division between the revolutionary line and the capitulationist line. However, the plot did not simply kill him off in a satisfying way, but instead arranged for Yang Si to let Yang Shao Kui go, so that this impure element who was still in the revolutionary ranks was finally exposed, which was completely necessary. When Yang Shao Kui fled to escape death, he killed Hei Zi and counterattacked again. Liu Tianyou took advantage of Zhao Hong's absence to ask for instructions from his superiors, and later when the troops were surrounded, food and ammunition were exhausted, and Zhao Hong was arrested in an extremely critical situation, Liu Tianyou repeatedly tried to pull down the red flag and forcibly order the troops to lay down their weapons and surrender. It was not until Zhao Hong brought back the resolution of the "August 7th Meeting" that Liu Tianyou, who was repeatedly claiming to obey the orders of his superiors, was deprived of his right to speak, revealing his true colors, betraying the enemy, and becoming the enemy's running dog, even stooping to the point of persuading Zhao Hong to write a "letter of repentance." This dirty thing was finally ended by Yang Shao Kui's bullet. This is the end of persisting in mistakes and betraying the enemy. Under the implementation of the "August 7th Meeting" resolution, in preparation for joining forces with the Red Army, Zhao Hong left the most arduous task of covering the retreat of the brigade to himself. In the crisis of battle, he also strangled Yang Si, climbed up the cliff, threw his last grenade, killed most of the bandits, fought to the last man, and jumped off the cliff to be captured. The play turns the enemy's plan to kill Zhao Hong and sacrifice him at Yang Shanren's tomb into a place to protect the lives of the masses and promote communism, elevating this positive character with noble communist qualities to a high ideological realm, which is fundamentally contrasted with Liu Tianyou.

    "Red Heart of Loyalty" is a good play! It is a vivid and visualized lesson in Party history! It is a paean to the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

    一首毛泽东思想的赞歌
    ——话剧《赤胆红心》观后
    吴克坚
    我怀着愉快的心情，看了湖南省话剧团《赤胆红心》的演出，我仿佛重新置身于这一斗争中，同战斗的同志们共着呼吸脉搏，一起为毛泽东思想的胜利而欢呼！
    1927年4月12日，蒋介石在上海等地举行反革命政变，大肆屠杀工人，镇压农民和打击共产党。许克祥仅以一团之众，在5月21日夜间，把工会、农会和共产党的机关干部和群众，打的打，杀的杀，一夜之间，白色恐怖笼罩了长沙省城，这就是历史上有名的“马日事变”。当时共产党内，以陈独秀为首的右倾机会主义领导，拒绝接受以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线，放弃无产阶级的领导权，拒绝农民的土地要求和武装斗争，不相信工农群众的力量能够击退蒋介石的进攻。陈独秀等投降主义者，为了迁就国民党，宁愿抛弃农民这个最主要的同盟军，使工人阶级和共产党处于孤立无援的地位，使蒋介石国民党利用了这个弱点，乘虚而入，举行叛变。可是事变并没有按照投降主义者的路线发展下去，而是按照毛泽东同志的思想前进。当时毛泽东同志的正确思想，当时毛泽东同志所发表的著名的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，在党员和群众中有着巨大的影响。1927年8月7日党中央的会议，就是适应这种形势，清算了陈独秀等右倾机会主义领导的错误，在危急的关头挽救了革命。
    话剧《赤胆红心》，就是以上述的动荡的时代为背景的。故事发生所在地的湖南浏阳杨家冲的革命同志和群众，不怕天大的困难，临死不向困难低头，斩钉截铁地站在毛泽东思想这边，紧紧握住红旗，放手发动群众，打土豪，分田地，拿起刀枪，坚决反击蒋介石匪帮的进攻。同时坚决与党内陈独秀机会主义分子斗争，在说服、斗争，他们仍不悔改之后，坚决把他们驱逐出党，这样使斗争转危为安，转败为胜，显示出毛泽东思想就是胜利。这就充分展示了剧本的主导思想，敌我分明，是非分明，具有高度的思想鲜明性。话剧的演出，正配合着反对国际上的现代修正主义和全党全民热烈学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志著作的时候，更具有现实的深刻教育意义。
    话剧一开始，就把敌人的狰狞面目暴露在观众面前。在乌云遮天，大地寂静的夜空，在跑步、叫骂、哭喊混成的恐怖声中，无辜善良的群众被杀害了，连妇女怀中的小孩也不免一死！鲜血染红了半山腰上，烈火烧毁了农民协会，土豪杨善人指手划脚声称：“那天给我戴高帽子游乡的，抓住了给我全家杀绝！”这就是蒋介石“四·一二”屠杀的缩影！这些反动派血淋淋的双手，对人民阶级仇恨本性的暴露场面，怎能不引起观众磨拳擦掌，恨之入骨！
    在革命队伍面前，摆着两条道路，投降则死，抵抗则生，二者必居其一。体现毛主席思想的赵宏和体现陈独秀投降主义思想的刘天佑，在最初的时候，就鲜明地展开了斗争。刘天佑一开头就被白色恐怖吓破了胆，说什么“现在形势敌强我弱，弄得不好，不是刺激了人家，惹火烧身？”赵宏则坚决主张：“马上组织农民自卫军，拿起武器和敌人干！”他回答刘天佑说：“老虎本来是要吃人的，你就是不惹他，他也不会放过你。”这是何等鲜明的对照！事实证明这个论点的正确。当赵宏悲愤地站在被敌人杀害的段母和群众的尸旁号召“组织农民自卫军，拿起武器跟他们干”的时候，赵宏、段虎、红姑和谷云龙等英雄形象，引起了观众极大欣慰。他们揩干自己的眼泪，踏过死者的血迹，化悲愤为力量，异口同声地说：“属老虎的站出来一块儿干！”“咱们组织农民自卫军，永远跟着共产党走，坚决打垮反动派！”赵宏前面走，段虎把红旗一挥，大家雄赳赳、气昂昂地走上豹子岭！剧中这几个英雄正面人物的行动，塑造得多么坚决、勇敢、干脆，刻划得多么不怕困难、充满对革命胜利的信心。
    两条路线的斗争，在上山以后继续尖锐地展开。肚子要吃饭，敌人要消灭，这只有发动群众，依靠群众，从开展对敌斗争中才能求得解决。赵宏抓到问题的关键，制土炮，练士兵，抱着“打开杨家三座楼，粮食枪炮不用愁”的方针。但这在刘天佑看来是“开玩笑”，是“荒唐”，在敌人一张白纸黑字面前，吓得不敢下山发动群众，反而引经据典，拿出议会“理论”，想以教条来吓唬人。赵宏义正词严地说：“斗争主要形式是刀对刀，枪对枪的武装斗争！”“革命就是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的暴烈行动，要不是这样，怎么能够推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力呢？”寥寥数语，针锋相对，驳得右倾机会主义者体无完肤，高度体现出毛泽东思想的鲜明性。
    尖锐的思想斗争随着戏剧情节的进展逐渐进入高潮。在开仓分粮、杀了土豪之后，刘天佑伤心地连叫“糟了”，竟无耻地说什么“现阶段的革命应该由国民党统率”，赵宏骂他“这是出卖！”这几句对话有力地反映出革命领导权的根本问题，显示革命路线与投降路线的根本分野。然而，剧情并没有简单地杀他一场，大快人心，而是安排杨四放走杨少奎，把这个仍留在革命队伍的不纯分子最后暴露出来，是完全必要的。而杨少奎在临死脱逃时，干掉黑子，再度反扑，刘天佑则乘赵宏到上级请示和在以后部队被围，粮尽弹绝，赵宏被捕极端危急之际，刘天佑一次又一次地，企图拔掉红旗，强令部队放下武器投降，一直到赵宏带来了“八七会议”决议，才剥夺了这个口口声声遵从上级命令的刘天佑的发言权，使他原形毕露，背叛投敌，成为敌人的狗腿子，竟下流到去劝赵宏写“自新书”。这个肮脏的东西，最后还是吃了杨少奎的子弹而结束的，这就是坚持错误和叛变投敌的下场。赵宏在贯彻执行“八七会议”决议下，在准备与红军会师中，把最艰巨的掩护大队撤退的任务留给自己，在战斗危急中，还掐死杨四，爬上悬崖，扔下自己最后一颗手榴弹，炸死大部匪兵，战至最后一人，跳下悬崖被擒。戏里把敌人准备杀赵宏祭杨善人的墓地，变为保护群众生命和宣传共产主义的场所，把这个具有共产主义高贵品质的正面人物，升华到高度的思想境界，这恰和刘天佑成了根本的对照。
    《赤胆红心》是一出好戏，这是一堂生动的、形象化的党史课！这是一首毛泽东思想胜利的赞歌！
