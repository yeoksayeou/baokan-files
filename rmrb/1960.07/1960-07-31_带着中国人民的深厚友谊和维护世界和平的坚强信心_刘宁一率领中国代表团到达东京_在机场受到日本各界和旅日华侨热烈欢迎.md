He said that all Japanese people who love peace and democracy are sincerely waiting for your visit. He said that the Japanese people have been fighting tirelessly for the visit of the Chinese delegation. Iwai expressed that the Japanese people will work to normalize Sino-Japanese relations.

Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, emphasized in his speech that the Chinese people sending a delegation to visit Japan today demonstrates the will of the Chinese and Japanese people to further unite and jointly struggle for world peace.

Yasui stated that the Japanese people are determined to work towards establishing a peaceful government that does not antagonize China.

Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, delivered a welcome speech, saying that the Japan Socialist Party is willing to work for Japan's independence, democracy, and the normalization of relations between Japan and China. He hoped that the delegation would have extensive contact with various circles in Japan during its visit in order to understand the feelings of the Japanese people.

Head of the delegation Liu Ningyi delivered a speech at the airport. He said: "The Chinese delegation has come to Tokyo today carrying the profound friendship of the 650 million Chinese people for the Japanese people and the firm confidence in safeguarding world peace. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to pay heartfelt respect to the gentlemen of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs who invited us, and to friends from all walks of life in Japan.

"For more than a year, the Japanese people have carried out many heroic united actions to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle not only conforms to the interests of the Japanese people but also encourages the people of all countries to carry out the struggle against the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and to defend world peace. All the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world stand on the side of the Japanese people. They support the just actions of the Japanese people and cheer for their achievements.

"Japan is our close neighbor, and there is a long-standing friendship and close relationship between our two peoples. Our friendship and friendly relations cannot be destroyed by any external force. We believe that through the efforts of the people of our two countries, we will continue to overcome the various obstacles on the road ahead and further consolidate and develop the friendship and friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples."

Liu Ningyi held a press conference at the airport, where he once again emphasized the great achievements made by the Japanese people in their patriotic and just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance and their contribution to the cause of peace in Asia.
