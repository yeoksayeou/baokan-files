Xinhua News Agency, July 15th dispatch from Léopoldville: The atrocities of the Belgian aggressor troops in the Congo have enraged the residents of the Congolese capital, Léopoldville. On the 14th, groups of armed Congolese residents joined forces with the Congolese army to resist the armed suppression by the Belgian aggressors.

The news says that in order to effectively combat the continuously invading Belgian aggressor troops, the Congolese army in Léopoldville is actively expanding its ranks. A large number of Congolese residents have joined the army and have been equipped with uniforms and weapons from the military camp's warehouses.

It is reported that in the Léopoldville "African residential area," everywhere one can see the anger felt by the people towards the Belgian aggressor troops' atrocities of killing Congolese people inside the airport and in the city. Crowds gathered in large numbers, discussing how to express their anger. Tension is everywhere. Colonialists are being reviled. People gathered in the streets are also fighting back against the provocations of the Belgian colonialists with stones.

Reports say that the Belgian aggressor troops who parachuted into Léopoldville on the 13th completely occupied the city's "white residential area" on the 14th. They patrolled there in jeeps or trucks. A Belgian fighter plane carrying rockets circled over the urban area, attempting to intimidate the Congolese people.

It is reported that by the 14th, the Belgian government had airlifted seven parachute companies into Léopoldville, bringing the number of Belgian aggressor troops in the city to a sharp increase of two thousand five hundred. Some reports say that in order to prevent the Congolese military and civilians from hearing news that would boost their morale, the Belgian aggressor troops and the Belgian embassy in the Congo used Belgian "technicians" in the Congo to sabotage the Congolese national radio station on the 13th.

On the 14th, Congolese Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga delivered a radio address in the Congolese capital, condemning the Belgian government's armed aggression against the Congo. He emphasized that the fighting between the Belgian army and the Congolese army was caused by the provocations of the Belgian colonialists. He reiterated that Belgium's interventionist actions violated the treaty signed between Belgium and the Congolese Republic and also violated the wishes of the Congolese government. He pointed out that the Belgian government should bear the responsibility for the situation in the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th dispatch from Léopoldville: African residents of the Congolese capital, Léopoldville, rose up on the 14th to strike at the Belgian colonialists who were attempting to continue their rule over them.

It is reported that on that day, after the news spread that a Congolese soldier had been innocently killed by the Belgian army that had invaded Léopoldville, crowds of angry Congolese residents gathered in the streets, bravely fought back against the provocations of the Belgian colonialists, and attacked the colonialists' cars with stones. Some reports said that on the 14th, a Congolese government minister, while condemning Belgium for sending troops to invade the Congo, called for the demolition of the statues of colonialists such as Leopold II in the city of Léopoldville. Leopold II was the first Belgian king to invade the Congo by force more than seventy years ago.

Léopoldville is a city in the Congo with a rich tradition of anti-colonialist struggle. On January 4th of last year, the people there first launched a large-scale riot against colonialism and for independence.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th dispatch from Léopoldville: Congolese Republic President Kasavubu and Prime Minister Lumumba angrily condemned the Belgian government's aggressive actions and demanded the withdrawal of the Belgian aggressor troops when they returned to Léopoldville airport, the Congolese capital, on the evening of the 14th.

It is reported that when Lumumba and his party stepped off the plane, a "guard of honor" of Belgian paratroopers was lined up at the airport. The Belgian aggressor troops' commander in the Congo, Chomé, and the commander of the Belgian paratroopers who invaded Léopoldville, Gheysen, both arrogantly demanded that Lumumba and Kasavubu accept their aggressive "fait accompli." Lumumba angrily denounced, "I condemn this action," and he demanded the withdrawal of the Belgian aggressor troops.

The Belgian aggressor troops' commander, Chomé, also said to Lumumba in an insulting and provocative tone, "Prime Minister, I am here to provide protection." Lumumba firmly replied, "We have our own army, we do not need any protection"; "We do not accept this protection."

Lumumba and Kasavubu refused to walk towards the Belgian paratrooper "guard of honor" and refused to ride in a car provided by the Belgian colonialists to enter the city.

Reuters and Associated Press both reported that, at the instigation of the Belgian aggressor troops, a group of Belgian colonialists brazenly surrounded the Congolese government leaders at the airport, openly clamoring for them to "kneel down."

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, July 13th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party today published a communiqué in "Red Flag" newspaper, calling on the Belgian people to rise up against the bloody suppression of the Congo by the Belgian colonialists.

The communiqué said that the Belgian colonialists have torn off their masks and are preparing to carry out the most brutal intervention in the Congo, followed by a long-term occupation, and are attempting to subvert the Lumumba government.

The communiqué pointed out that the Congolese people will never give up freedom, and military suppression is doomed to failure. It said: "The experience of the whole world has shown that no military force—no matter how strong it is—can repel the people's liberation movement."

The communiqué said that in the face of the reactionaries' offensive, the working class must unite all the people's forces in the country. To this end, the Belgian Communist Party calls on Belgian workers and democrats to establish a united front against all kinds of military intervention in the Congo.

    新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比利时侵略部队在刚果的暴行激怒了刚果首都利奥波德维尔的居民。14日，成群的刚果武装起来的居民在那里同刚果军队一道抗击比利时侵略者的武装镇压。
    消息说，为了有力地打击正在不断入侵的比利时侵略军，利奥波德维尔的刚果军队在积极扩大自己的队伍。大批刚果居民参加了军队，他们用军营仓库里的军服和武器装备了起来。
    据报道，在利奥波德维尔“非洲人居住区”，到处可以看到人们对比利时侵略军在机场内和市内杀死刚果人的暴行所感到的愤怒。人群大量聚集着，议论如何表明他们愤怒。到处都是紧张。殖民主义者都受到唾骂。聚集在街头的人们还纷纷用石头反击比利时殖民者的挑衅。
    有消息说，在13日空降到利奥波德维尔的比利时侵略军在14日完全占领了这个城市的“白人居民区”。他们在那里坐着吉普车或卡车巡逻。一架载有火箭的比利时战斗机在市区上空盘旋，企图威吓刚果人民。
    据报道，到14日为止，比利时政府已经空运了七个伞兵连侵入利奥波德维尔，使在这个城市的比利时侵略军剧增到二千五百人。有消息说，比利时侵略军和比利时驻刚果的大使馆为了不让刚果军民听到鼓舞他们斗志的消息，曾在13日利用比利时在刚果的“技术人员”破坏刚果的国家电台。
    14日，刚果共和国副总理基赞加在刚果首都发表广播演说，谴责比利时政府武装侵略刚果。他强调指出，比利时军队同刚果军队发生的战斗是由于比利时殖民者的挑衅而引起的。他重申比利时的干涉行为违反了比利时和刚果共和国之间签订的条约，也违反刚果政府的意愿。他指出，比利时政府应该承担刚果局势的责任。
    新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都利奥波德维尔的非洲居民，14日群起打击企图继续统治他们的比利时殖民者。
    据报道，当天，当有一名刚果士兵被侵入利奥波德维尔的比利时军队无辜杀害的消息传出后，成群愤怒的刚果居民就聚集在街道上，英勇反击比利时殖民者对他们的挑衅，并且用石块袭击殖民者的汽车。有消息说，14日，一位刚果政府部长在谴责比利时派兵侵略刚果的同时，号召拆除在利奥波德维尔城市中的利奥波德二世等的殖民者的纪念像。利奥波德二世是七十多年前第一个用武力侵占刚果的比利时国王。
    利奥波德维尔是刚果富有反殖民主义斗争传统的城市。去年1月4日，那里的人民曾首先掀起反对殖民主义、争取独立的大规模暴动。
    新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总统卡萨武布和总理卢蒙巴在14日晚上回到刚果首都利奥波德维尔机场时，愤怒地谴责了比利时政府的侵略行为，并要比利时侵略军撤退。
    据报道，当卢蒙巴等一行人走下飞机时，机场上排列了一队比利时伞兵的“仪仗队”。比利时在刚果的侵略军司令曲蒙和侵入利奥波德维尔的比利时伞兵司令盖桑都蛮横地要卢蒙巴和卡萨武布接受他们侵略的“既成事实”。卢蒙巴愤怒地指责说，“我谴责这种行动”，他并要比利时侵略军撤退。
    比利时侵略军司令曲蒙还以侮辱和挑衅的口吻对卢蒙巴说，“总理先生，我在这里提供保护。”卢蒙巴坚决回答说，“我们有我们自己的军队，我们不需要任何保护”；“我们不接受这种保护”。
    卢蒙巴和卡萨武布拒绝走向比利时伞兵“仪仗队”，并且拒绝乘坐一辆由比利时殖民者提供的汽车入城。
    路透社和美联社都报道说，在比利时侵略军的怂恿下，一群比利时殖民者在机场上曾放肆地包围了刚果政府领袖，公然叫嚣要他们“跪下来”。
    新华社布鲁塞尔13日电　比利时共产党中央委员会政治局今天在“红旗报”上发表公报，号召比利时人民起来反对比利时殖民主义者对刚果的血腥镇压。
    公报说，比利时殖民主义分子已经撕下假面具，准备对刚果进行最残暴的干涉并继之以长期的占领，并且企图颠复卢蒙巴政府。
    公报指出，刚果人民绝不会放弃自由，军事镇压注定要失败。它说：“全世界的经验已经表明，没有军事力量——不管它的实力如何——能够击退人民的解放运动。”
    公报说，面临着反动派的进攻，工人阶级要团结国内的一切人民力量。为此，比利时共产党要求比利时的工人和民主人士建立反对在刚果进行各种军事干涉的统一阵线。
