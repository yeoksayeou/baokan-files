    To Swiftly Put All Power Drainage and Irrigation Equipment into Use
    Shanxi's Industrial, Commercial, and Agricultural Departments Cooperate to Organize the Return, Matching, and Repair of Power Drainage and Irrigation Equipment
    (Our Dispatch from Taiyuan, July 23rd) Fully utilizing all power drainage and irrigation equipment sent to rural areas is an urgent task that Shanxi's industrial, commercial, agricultural departments, and county/commune local industries are jointly working to complete in support of agriculture.
    In recent years, Shanxi's commercial departments have transferred over 230,000 horsepower of various power drainage and irrigation equipment to rural areas. According to a survey by the Provincial Economic Commission, among this equipment, over 29,000 horsepower is unmatched, over 38,000 horsepower is damaged, 47,000 horsepower has been borrowed by local industries or sideline processing and has not been returned, and only 116,000 horsepower is directly used for agricultural production. If the unmatched equipment is matched, the damaged equipment is repaired, and the borrowed equipment is returned, the irrigated area could be expanded by over 275,000 mu, which would be of great significance for combating drought, protecting the autumn harvest, and strengthening agricultural power.
    To ensure that all of this drainage and irrigation equipment is put into production and to seize a bumper autumn harvest, the enlarged meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee in late June decided that all counties and communes should quickly organize the return, matching, and repair of idle power drainage and irrigation equipment and agricultural machinery in rural areas. Three thousand technical workers should be immediately transferred from industrial enterprises to help the people's communes in each county with repairs; some machinery factories should be designated to manufacture spare parts and accessories in batches; and counties and communes should be gradually helped to establish networks for machinery protection, repair, and maintenance. In accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, industrial, commercial, and agricultural departments and county/commune industries throughout the province have taken action. The Provincial Industrial Machinery Department, the Electric Power Department, and the Agricultural Machinery Department have allocated the 160,000 pieces of accessories and parts requested by the Agricultural Department and the Water Conservancy Department to machinery factories such as the Datong Diesel Engine Factory, requiring them to be completed on time with guaranteed quality and quantity. The commercial system at all levels throughout the province has cleared out over 2,000 units of power drainage and irrigation machinery, water pumps, rubber hoses, belts, and other inventory from warehouses, which are being successively transferred to drought-stricken areas to assemble the machinery into complete sets for use as soon as possible. "Machine medical teams" composed of over 3,000 technical workers drawn from county-run and above machinery factories, carrying various parts and tools, are going to the countryside in batches to rush-repair power drainage and irrigation equipment and agricultural machinery.
    All parts of the province are also seizing this task in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. The Huaihai Machinery Factory in Changzhi City organized a technical worker repair team which, in the past month, helped 66 nearby communes and 128 management districts repair 375 machines. The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory in Yuci City extracted more than 150 workers and more than 30 lathes to establish a workshop specifically for repairing and matching parts for agriculture, supplying whatever the communes lacked and supporting them in every way. Qin County has also formulated an "almanac" for industrial support to agriculture. By sending technical teams to the countryside, not only were machines repaired, but technical personnel were also trained. After county-wide coordination and allocation, Hongtong County made sure that the original 65 machines lacking water pumps were no longer lacking, the 30 waterwheels without power had power, and the more than 20 waterwheels lacking parts were fitted with replacements, increasing the irrigated area twelvefold. In Yuncheng County, 415 power machines and 650 various water lifting tools were repaired in ten days, increasing the county's irrigated area from 13,000 mu to 21,000 mu.

    把所有动力排灌设备都迅速使用起来
    山西工业、商业、农业部门同心协力组织动力排灌设备归队、配套、修复工作
    本报太原23日电　把所有运往农村的动力排灌设备都充分使用起来，这是山西工业、商业、农业部门和县、社地方工业，正在同心协力完成的一项支援农业的紧迫任务。
    几年来，山西商业部门调运农村的各种动力排灌设备，有二十三万多马力，根据省经济委员会的调查，在这些动力排灌设备中，不配套的有两万九千多马力，损坏的有三万八千多马力，借用给地方工业或副业加工未归队的有四万七千多马力，直接用于农业生产的只有十一万六千多马力。如果把没有配套的配套，损坏的修好，借用的归队，就可以扩大灌溉面积二十七万五千多亩，对于抗旱保秋，加强农业力量都有着极为重大的意义。
    为了使这些排灌设备全部投入生产，夺取秋季生产丰收，6月下旬举行的中共山西省委扩大会议决定：各县、社迅速组织归队、配套、修复农村被闲置的动力排灌设备和农业机械。立即从工业企业中再抽掉三千名技术工人帮助各县人民公社检修；指定一部分机器厂成批制造备品和配件；并且逐步帮助各县社建立起机械的保护、修配网。根据省委的指示，全省工业、商业、农业部门和县、社工业都已行动起来。省工业机械厅、电力厅和农业机械厅，已经把农业厅、水力厅提出需要的十六万件配件、零件，分配给大同柴油机等机械厂，要求按质、按量、按时完成。全省各级商业系统从仓库中清理出二千多台动力排灌机械、水泵、胶管、皮带等许多存货，正陆续调往干旱地区，尽早使机械装配成套使用。由县营以上的机械厂抽掉三千多技术工人组成的“机器医疗队”，携带各种零件、工具正在分批下乡，抢修动力排灌设备和农业机械。
    全省各地也都根据省委指示，狠抓这一工作。长治市淮海机器厂组织技术工人抢修队，在最近一个月内，帮助附近的六十六个公社、一百二十八个管理区抢修机械三百七十五个。榆次市经纬纺织机械厂抽出了一百五十多个工人、三十多台车床建立了专门为农业修配零件的车间，公社里缺什么，就马上配什么，支援什么。沁县还制定了工业支援农业的“皇历”。通过技术大队下乡，不但修好了机器，还帮助培养技术人员。洪洞县经过全县协作调配，使原来六十五台缺水泵的机器不缺了，三十台没有动力的水车有了动力，二十多台缺零的水车得到了添配，浇地面积扩大了十二倍。运城县十天内修好了的动力机械有四百一十五部，各种提水工具六百五十部，使全县浇地由一万三千亩提高到二万一千亩。
