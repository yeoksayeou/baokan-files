Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: The first session of the Second National Assembly of Vietnam solemnly opened in Hanoi this morning. This National Assembly was elected in the general election on May 8th of this year.

President Ho Chi Minh announced the opening of the meeting. Following President Ho Chi Minh's suggestion, all representatives stood up to express their warm respect to the people of South Vietnam who are engaged in a heroic struggle.

After Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered the opening speech, Hoang Van Hoan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered a report to the assembly on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on the results of the election of representatives to the Second National Assembly.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a report on the work of the government to the National Assembly. In his report, when discussing the international situation, he said, "Today, the struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is one of the primary revolutionary tasks of our people and the people of the world."

He said that the struggle against imperialism is to safeguard and consolidate peace, to strive for and defend national sovereignty and independence, for freedom and democracy, social progress and socialism. Therefore, we, the Vietnamese people, together with the people of the world, must more resolutely carry out this great struggle, resolutely expose imperialism, isolate imperialism, defeat imperialism, and direct the spearhead of the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Pham Van Dong said, "The world today is such a battlefield: on one side are the most reactionary forces of aggression and war, imperialism, the most ferocious of which is U.S. imperialism; on the other side are the forces of peace, democracy, national independence and socialism, with the great Soviet Union as the pillar of this force."

Pham Van Dong said, "Because the balance of power is in favor of the socialist camp, and because the Soviet Union and the socialist countries' policy of peaceful coexistence is receiving more and more sympathy and support from the vast majority of people in the world, the recent international situation has eased to a certain extent. At the same time, the most reactionary and bellicose groups in monopoly capitalism are trying to maintain tension and intensify the Cold War. The US reconnaissance plane's violation of Soviet airspace and the US government's stubborn attitude towards this matter, which undermined the Paris summit, eloquently proved that the aggressive and war-like nature of imperialism has not changed."

He said that the Vietnamese people, like the people of many other countries in the world, have fought against imperialism and are very familiar with the nature, actions and bandit-like face of imperialism. "Sometimes imperialism also sings the tune of peace and pretends to be willing to ease the situation, but in reality it is unwilling to have peace. It is stepping up its war preparations."

Pham Van Dong said that the firm attitude taken by the Soviet Union after the U.S. reconnaissance plane incident was entirely correct, and this is the attitude that a country that respects its sovereignty and exercises its rights, and requires other countries to respect it as well, should have.

Pham Van Dong mentioned the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament in his speech. He said that world public opinion sincerely welcomes these new proposals. However, the situation at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference proves that Western countries are unwilling to discuss the Soviet proposals because they are actually unwilling to disarm.

Pham Van Dong said, "It is unreasonable to solve the major international issues of the present day while excluding the 650 million Chinese people. Therefore, despite the reactionary and ignorant attempt by U.S. imperialism to cover the sky with one hand, truth will triumph in international relations, and the great People's Republic of China will gain its due place on the international stage today."

When talking about the situation in the Far East and Southeast Asia, Pham Van Dong said, "Since the Second World War, the situation has been constantly tense due to the interference and aggression of various imperialist countries, especially U.S. imperialism. The war has never completely stopped; the new war crises created by U.S. imperialism are threatening the people of all countries in this region. However, it is also in this region that the tide of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, who are creating war and aggression, is surging with unparalleled intensity and has achieved brilliant victories."

Pham Van Dong stated that the Vietnamese government firmly supports Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, and makes every effort to oppose and severely condemn U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities for interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs; he also condemned U.S. imperialism for continuing to intensify its interference in Laos, directly threatening the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina.

When talking about the struggle for the reunification of the motherland, Pham Van Dong said, "In order to reunify the motherland, the Vietnamese people must resolutely wage the struggle against U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are the root cause of all poverty and disasters for the people of the South today."

Pham Van Dong justifiably criticized the erroneous resolution passed by the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Commission by a majority vote on allowing the increase of military personnel in the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in South Vietnam, and expressed his disagreement with the erroneous resolution passed by the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Commission on South Vietnam's Ordinance No. 10 of 1959.

When talking about the achievements of socialist transformation in North Vietnam, Pham Van Dong pointed out that at present, more than 54% of farmers in the entire North have joined agricultural cooperatives, and the situation of the agricultural cooperation movement is basically good. He said that in the mountainous areas, the agricultural cooperation movement combined with democratic reform work has been launched in 1,185 villages, which includes half of the villages in the mountainous areas, and has achieved good results.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the peaceful transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, and the handicraft cooperation movement has also made significant progress.

When talking about the situation of socialist construction in North Vietnam, Pham Van Dong said that the national plan for the first half of this year has achieved significant achievements. In agriculture, despite the rare disastrous year this year, the rice yield did not reach the planned target, but it was still higher than the highest pre-war year of 1939. In industry, the total output value of state-owned industries in the first half of this year was more than 101% of the plan for the first half of this year, and more than 50% of the annual plan for this year, an increase of 33.2% compared with the same period last year.

He said, "A very welcome achievement is that we have successfully established small blast furnaces for iron smelting in some places, and we are working hard to develop small blast furnaces while establishing small converters for steel making."

Pham Van Dong also cited facts to show that cultural, educational and scientific research work has also continued to develop greatly since this year.

At today's meeting, Sun Quang Phuc, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, Nguyen Khang, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office, Pham Van Bach, President of the Supreme Court, and Bui Lam, Chief Procurator of the People's Procuratorate, respectively reported on the draft laws of the National Assembly Organization Law, the Government Conference Organization Law, the People's Court Organization Law, and the People's Procuratorate Organization Law.

In addition to passing the organizational laws of these institutions, this session of the Vietnamese National Assembly will also elect the President and Vice President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, the Government Conference, the President of the Supreme People's Court, and the Chief Procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

On the morning of July 7, tens of thousands of people gathered near the National Assembly venue to warmly welcome the opening of the National Assembly meeting. (Attached picture)

    范文同总理谈当前革命的首要任务
    坚决进行反对美帝的斗争维护和平
    越南北方社会主义改造和社会主义建设获得重大成就
    美帝及其走狗是越南南方人民一切贫困和灾难的根源
    新华社河内7日电　越南第二届国会第一次会议今天上午在河内隆重开幕。这一届国会是在今年5月8日大选中产生的。
    胡志明主席宣布大会开幕。按照胡志明主席的提议全体代表起立，向英勇斗争中的南越人民表示亲切的敬意。
    在国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜致开幕词后，国会常务委员会副委员长黄文欢代表国会常务委员会向大会作了关于第二届国会代表选举结果的报告。
    范文同总理向国会作了关于政府工作的报告。他在报告中谈到国际形势时说，“今天，反对帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，是我国人民和世界人民的首要革命任务之一。”
    他说，反对帝国主义的斗争就是为了维护和巩固和平，为了争取和维护民族的主权和独立，为了自由和民主、社会进步和社会主义。因此，我们越南人民同世界人民一起，要更加坚决地进行这个伟大的斗争，坚决揭露帝国主义，孤立帝国主义，打败帝国主义，把斗争的锋芒指向美帝国主义。
    范文同说，“今天的世界是这样的斗争场所：一方是侵略、好战的最反动的力量，是帝国主义，其中最凶恶的是美帝国主义；另一方是和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的力量，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营是这一力量的支柱。”
    范文同说，“由于力量的对比有利于社会主义阵营，由于苏联和社会主义各国的和平共处政策越来越受到世界各国绝大多数人民的同情和支持，最近国际形势有了一定程度的缓和。与此同时，垄断资本主义中最反动、最好战的集团却力图维持紧张局势，加剧冷战。美国侦察飞机侵犯苏联领空以及美国政府对这件事的顽固态度，破坏了巴黎最高级会议，雄辩地证明了帝国主义的侵略和战争本质并没有改变。”
    他说，越南人民同全世界其他许多国家的人民一样，曾经同帝国主义进行过斗争，对帝国主义的本质、行动和强盗面目是很熟悉的。“有时帝国主义也唱唱和平的调子，装作愿意缓和局势，但实际上它是不愿意和平的。它正在变本加厉地备战。”
    范文同说，苏联在美国侦察机事件以后采取的坚决态度是完全正确的，这是一个尊重自己主权并行使自己的权利、要求其他国家也加以尊重的国家的应有态度。
    范文同在讲话中谈到苏联提出的关于全面和彻底裁军问题的新建议。他说，世界舆论真诚地欢迎这些新的建议。但是十国裁军会议的情况证明，西方国家不愿意讨论苏联的建议，因为它们实际上不愿意裁军。
    范文同说，“要解决当前重大的国际问题而撇开六亿五千万中国人民，这是毫无道理的。因此，尽管反动和无知的美帝国主义企图一手遮天，在国际关系中，真理将要胜利，在今天的国际舞台上，伟大的中华人民共和国将会取得它的应有的地位。”
    范文同在谈到远东和东南亚的形势时说，“自从第二次世界大战后到现在，由于各帝国主义国家特别是美帝国主义的干涉和侵略活动，使形势经常地处于紧张状态。战争从来没有完全停止过；美帝国主义制造的新的战争危机，正在威胁这个区域的各国人民。然而也是在这个区域中，反对制造战争和侵略的美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争浪潮中，正在以无比猛烈的趋势汹涌澎湃着，并且取得了轰轰烈烈的胜利。”
    范文同表示，越南政府坚决支持柬埔寨的和平中立政策，竭力反对和严厉谴责美帝国主义及南越当局干涉柬埔寨内政；他并且谴责美帝国主义仍然在加紧干涉老挝，直接威胁着越南民主共和国和印度支那的和平。
    范文同在谈到统一祖国的斗争问题时说，“为了统一祖国，越南人民必须坚决进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。美帝国主义及其走狗是当前南方人民一切贫困和灾难的根源。”
    范文同据理批判了国际委员会印、加代表以多数通过的关于允许在南越的美国军事援助顾问团增加军事人员的错误决议，并且表示不能同意国际委员会印、加代表通过的关于南越1959年第十号法令的错误决议。
    范文同在谈到越南北方的社会主义改造的成就时指出，目前，全北方已有54％以上的农户参加了农业社，农业合作化运动的情况基本上是好的。他说，在山区，同民主改革工作相结合的农业合作化运动，已经在一千一百八十五个乡中展开，它包括了山区的一半乡村，并且已经取得了良好的结果。
    范文同指出，私营资本主义工商业的和平改造工作已经取得了具有决定性的胜利，手工业合作化运动也有了显著的进步。
    在谈到越南北方的社会主义建设情况时，范文同说，今年上半年的国家计划已经取得了重大的成就。农业方面，尽管今年遇到罕见灾年，稻米产量没有达到计划指标，但仍比战前产量最高的年份1939年还要高。工业方面，今年上半年国营工业产值约为今年上半年计划的101％以上，为今年年度计划的50％以上，与去年同期比较，增加了33.2％。
    他说，一个很值得欢迎的成绩是：我们已经在一些地方成功地建立了炼铁的小高炉，我们正在努力发展小高炉，同时建立炼钢的小转炉。
    范文同还列举事实，说明文化教育事业和科学研究工作在今年以来也继续获得很大的发展。
    在今天的会议上，越南国会常务委员会副委员长孙光阀、总理府部长阮康、最高法院院长范文白、人民检察院院长裴林，分别作了国会组织法、政府会议组织法、人民法院组织法、人民检察院组织法草案的报告。
    越南国会本次会议除了将通过这些机构的组织法以外，还将选举越南民主共和国主席和副主席，国会常务委员会，政府会议，最高人民法院院长，最高人民检察院院长等。
    7日上午，成千上万的群众聚集在国会会场附近，热烈欢迎国会会议的开幕。（附图片）
