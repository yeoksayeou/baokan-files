Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, China's outstanding writers are firmly advancing along the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In recent years, in the upsurge of literary and art workers across the country going deep into the masses and deep into life, writers have gone to the mountains and the countryside to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They have achieved unprecedented harvests in terms of ideology and creation. Novels, plays, poems, feature articles, essays, and other aspects have seen the emergence of a large number of excellent works.

Many writers have gone deep into life for a long time, appearing among the workers, peasants, and soldiers as practical workers and ordinary laborers. The famous writers Liu Qing, Zhao Shuli, Zhou Libo, Ai Wu, Cao Ming, Sha Ting, Na. Saiyinchaoketu, Tian Jian, Hu Ke, Chen Qitong, Du Pengcheng, Ma Jia, Jiang Muliang, Ma Feng, Wang Wenshi, Wu Qiang, Li Ji, Li Zhun, Hua Shan, Wen Jie, Cai Tianxin, Lei Jia, etc., have all gone deep into life for a long time, participating in the work of basic-level party committees or trade unions in factories, mines, rural areas, and troops, and some have served as ordinary workers and peasants. In the fiery life and struggle, the writers' ideological awareness has leaped forward, and they have completed and are creating works that reflect the great real life. Excellent full-length novels such as "History of Entrepreneurship," "Tempered Steel," "Mountain Village Changes," "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves," "Sanliwan Village," and "In the Days of Peace" are the latest creative achievements. For example, Liu Qing, the author of "History of Entrepreneurship," lived with his family in Huangfu Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, for eight years as if it was just one day, and served as a leader in the county party committee. When the first part of his "History of Entrepreneurship" was published at the end of last year, it was welcomed by the vast number of readers.

A large number of part-time writers maintain close contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in various ways according to their work situation. Guo Moruo, Ba Jin, Lao She, Tian Han, Xiao San, Ke Zhongping, and many other busy elderly writers have written many excellent works in recent years, and they also often go down for short periods to experience life and connect with the workers and peasants. Ke Zhongping, chairman of the Shaanxi branch of the Writers Association, although old and weak, still often goes to nearby rural areas to investigate and visit, and sometimes helps farmers harvest wheat.

Under the care and education of the Party, the vast number of writers in our country actively carry out self-transformation. They strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, learn the fine qualities of the proletariat, and continuously improve their ideological and creative levels. Their creations have received the help of the Party and the masses. In recent years, many writers have been tempered and transformed into proletarian literary and art fighters in the fiery life and struggle. The famous veteran writers Guo Moruo, Cao Yu, Ai Wu, etc., have all become glorious members of the Communist Party. A new force that is both red and expert has also emerged in large numbers, continuously strengthening our country's proletarian literary and artistic ranks.

    思想觉悟迅速提高　优秀作品大量涌现
    文艺工作者深入群众一箭双雕
    据新华社21日讯　在毛主席文艺思想指导下，我国的优秀作家们，坚定地沿着为工农兵服务的方向前进。近几年来，在全国广大文艺工作者深入群众、深入生活的热潮中，作家们纷纷上山下乡与工农兵群众相结合，在思想上、创作上都获得了空前的丰收，小说、剧本、诗歌、特写、散文等各方面都涌现了大量的优秀作品。
    许多作家长期深入生活，以实际工作者和普通劳动者的姿态出现在工农群众中。著名的作家柳青、赵树理、周立波、艾芜、草明、沙汀、纳·赛音朝克图、田间、胡可、陈其通、杜鹏程、马加、蒋牧良、马烽、王汶石、吴强、李季、李准、华山、闻捷、蔡天心、雷加等都曾长期深入生活，参加工矿、农村、部队基层党委或工会的工作，有的充当普通工人和农民。在火热的生活和斗争中，作家们思想觉悟飞跃提高，已经完成和正在创作反映伟大现实生活的作品。优秀的长篇小说“创业史”、“百炼成钢”、“山乡巨变”、“乘风破浪”、“三里湾”、“在和平的日子里”等，都是最新的创作成果。如“创业史”的作者柳青，八年如一日，全家长期在陕西长安县皇甫村落户，担任县委领导工作。当他的“创业史”第一部于去年年底发表后，受到了广大读者的欢迎。
    为数众多的兼职作家们，根据自己的工作情况，采取多种方式和工农兵群众保持密切联系。郭沫若、巴金、老舍、田汉、萧三、柯仲平等许多工作繁忙的老年作家，近年来写了不少优秀的作品，他们还经常短期的下去体验生活联系工农群众。作协陕西分会主席柯仲平，虽然年老体弱，仍经常到邻近的农村去调查访问，有时还帮助农民割麦子。
    我国的广大作家，在党的关怀教育下，积极进行自我改造。他们努力学习马列主义理论和毛主席的著作，学习无产阶级的优良品质，不断提高思想、创作水平，他们的创作得到党和群众的帮助。几年来，许多作家在火热的生活和斗争中，锻炼改造成为无产阶级的文艺战士，著名的老作家郭沫若、曹禺、艾芜等都已成为光荣的共产党员。又红又专的新生力量也大量涌现，不断壮大着我国无产阶级的文艺队伍。
