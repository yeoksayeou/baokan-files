	Extensive Propaganda, Organize Forces, Formulate Plans, Implement Measures:
	Wuxi Launches Upsurge of Support for Agriculture

	(Our Dispatch) Jiangsu's Wuxi Municipal Party Committee and Party committees at all levels, adhering to the spirit of "agriculture as the foundation," deeply carry out ideological education with agriculture as the foundation, and further strengthen leadership over industry's support for agriculture and cities' support for rural areas.

	Since the central government proposed accelerating the realization of agricultural technological transformation in the second half of last year, the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee has regarded supporting agriculture as one of the city's central tasks. In January of this year, at the city's Party Congress, it seriously discussed and deployed the work of industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting rural areas. After the meeting, through activities such as People's Congresses, cadre meetings, mass rallies, worker representatives visiting the countryside, and farmer representatives giving reports in the city, extensive publicity and education were conducted on industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting rural areas. On the basis of studying Mao Zedong Thought and improving understanding, Party organizations at all levels, through concrete actions of industry supporting agriculture, refuted erroneous ideas such as "supporting agriculture is only the business of industrial departments," "it is a temporary task," and even regarding supporting agriculture as a burden. This further enhanced the understanding of the significant meaning of supporting agriculture, and people of all walks of life, men and women, young and old, all regarded supporting agriculture as their primary and glorious task. The broad masses of workers, through vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, completed the repair and manufacture of a large number of drainage and irrigation equipment, electric plows, rice transplanters, threshers, and other agricultural machinery ahead of schedule. The broad masses of government cadres, scientific and technical personnel, commercial employees, school teachers and students, and literary, art, and medical workers all went to the countryside, striving to contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside.

	In order to make industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting rural areas a regular task for the people of the city, the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee formulated specific plans for supporting Wuxi County to achieve agricultural technological transformation ahead of schedule and supporting Huaiyin to catch up with the south of the Yangtze River as early as the fourth quarter of last year and the spring of this year. The plan emphasized greatly helping to develop county and commune industries to enhance the ability of rural areas to carry out technological transformation themselves. In a very short period, it helped 40 people's communes in Wuxi County establish 608 factories and expand 115 factories, ensuring that every commune had agricultural machinery factories, farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, and feed processing factories. At the same time, the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee also combined the development of county and commune industries with the transformation of old cities, based on the experience of supporting agriculture over the years, so that urban and rural areas are unified in planning and rational in the layout of industry. According to the distribution of more than 40 communes in Wuxi County, they divided the area into six "zones" centered on larger market towns as key support areas. In the process of helping to develop county and commune industries, Wuxi also decentralized some factories or products suitable for rural production to counties and communes, so that urban and rural industries can develop rationally.

	In order to ensure the in-depth and sustained development of the work of supporting agriculture, Wuxi has established support agriculture committees and leading groups with secretaries in command from the Municipal Party Committee to the District Party Committees and Factory Party Committees, and transferred cadres to establish special offices. From top to bottom, people are responsible at all levels, fighting on separate lines, and grasping one line to the end. Now, 310 factories, 31 secondary schools and above, and 16 hospitals in the city, as well as finance, trade, transportation, science, culture, and other units, have all respectively established counterpart ties with rural areas, fixed cooperation, divided labor and contracted responsibilities, and guaranteed results. Recently, the city also transferred more than 1,500 leading cadres and technical backbones to Wuxi County and Huaiyin Special Zone to strengthen the leadership and technical force of county and commune industries, and promote the development of agricultural production and the transformation of agricultural technology.

    广泛宣传　组织力量　制订计划　落实措施
    无锡掀起支援农业热潮
    本报讯　江苏无锡市委和各级党委本着农字当头的精神，深入地进行以农业为基础的思想教育，进一步加强对工业支援农业、城市支援农村的领导。
    自去年下半年中央提出了加速实现农业技术改造以后，无锡市委就把支援农业作为全市中心任务之一。今年1月在全市党代表大会上，认真讨论和部署了工业支援农业、城市支援农村的工作。会后，又通过人代会、干部大会、群众大会以及工人代表下乡参观、农民代表进城作报告等活动，大张旗鼓地进行了工业支援农业、城市支援农村的宣传教育。在学习毛泽东思想提高认识的基础上，各级党的组织又通过工业支援农业的具体行动就实论虚，集中批判了“支援农业只是工业部门的事”，“是临时的任务”，甚至把支援农业看成负担的错误思想，从而进一步认识到支援农业的重大意义，各行各业男女老少都把支援农业作为自己首要的和光荣的任务。广大工人群众，通过大搞技术革新和技术革命，提前完成了大批排灌设备、电犁、插秧机、脱粒机等农业机械的修配和制造任务。广大机关干部、科技人员、商业职工、学校师生和文艺、医务工作人员等，都纷纷下乡，争取为建设新农村贡献力量。
    为了使工业支援农业、城市支援农村作为全市人民的经常任务，无锡市委早在去年四季度和今年春季就分别制订了支援无锡县提前实现农业技术改造和支援淮阴赶江南的具体规划。在规划中特别强调了大力帮助发展县、社工业，以增强农村本身进行技术改造的能力。在很短的时期内就帮助无锡县四十个人民公社兴办工厂六百零八个、扩建工厂一百一十五个，做到社社有农业机械厂、农具厂、化肥厂、农药厂和饲料加工厂。同时，无锡市委还根据历年来支援农业的经验，把发展县社工业和改造旧城市相结合，使城乡统一规划，合理布局工业。他们根据无锡县四十多个公社的分布情况，以较大的集镇为中心划为六个“片”作为重点支援。在帮助发展县社工业的过程中，无锡市还把适合在农村生产的一些工厂或产品，下放给县社，使城乡工业合理发展。
    为了保证支援农业的工作深入持久地发展，无锡市从市委到各区委和工厂党委，都建立了有书记挂帅的支援农业委员会和领导小组，并抽调干部建立专门的办公室，从上到下层层有人负责，分线作战，一条线抓到底。现在，全市已有三百一十个工厂、三十一个中等以上学校和十六个医院，以及财贸交通和科学文化等单位，都分别与农村对口挂钩，固定协作，分工包干，一包到底。最近以来，市还抽调了一千五百多名领导干部和技术骨干，派往无锡县和淮阴专区，充实县社工业的领导和技术力量，促进农业生产的发展和农业技术的改造。
