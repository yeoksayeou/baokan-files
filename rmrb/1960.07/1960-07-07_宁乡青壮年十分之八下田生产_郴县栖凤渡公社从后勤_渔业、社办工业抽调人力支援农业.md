Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, recently concentrated 80% of its cadres, 80% of its rural labor force, and over 80% of its young and middle-aged people to strengthen summer planting and field management work, bringing about a new situation in agricultural production.

After the start of summer planting and field management, Ningxiang County experienced a period of slow progress in production. Li Xueliang, First Secretary of the Ningxiang County Party Committee, conducted an in-depth investigation and research in the Lianmeng Brigade of the Xiaduo Township Commune, and found that there was a problem of dispersed leadership and labor force in current agricultural production. This brigade had a total of 764 laborers, but only 56.5% of the total labor force participated in summer planting and field management, and only 32 of the 56 cadres above the level of work team leader were leading summer planting and field management. In particular, among the labor force participating in summer planting and field management, there were more women and fewer men, more semi-laborers and fewer strong laborers, which affected work efficiency and quality. In response to this problem, the County Party Committee held a special meeting and made a resolution to concentrate efforts to work hard in June and July to win a bumper harvest in agriculture. The County Party Committee carried out ideological education on adhering to and implementing "taking grain as the key link" to cadres and the masses by presenting facts, calculating the season, and calculating the labor force. Communes and brigades generally conducted a comprehensive inspection of all walks of life, such as industry, animal husbandry, aquatic products, and living welfare, and rationally adjusted the labor force. After adjustment, the labor force participating in agricultural production in Huangcai Commune accounted for 81.5% of the total labor force. Through rational adjustment and arrangement, the county has increased the agricultural labor force by more than 56,000 people. After comprehensive arrangement, Xiaduo Township Commune transferred more than 2,000 young and middle-aged laborers from all walks of life, increasing the young and middle-aged labor force in agricultural production from the original 5,500 to more than 7,700.

The full implementation of the "two-five" system of leadership among cadres, advocating field work, not only greatly changed the leadership style and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also reduced non-production personnel and increased the rural labor force. Now, 17,500 cadres throughout the county have gone deep into the fields to eat, live, and work with the masses. The offices of 17 communes and brigades have been moved to production teams or fields, and cadres are directing fields and experimental fields are also planted in backward areas and backward fields.

Because cadres took the lead, the whole Party and the whole people were united, and a lively production upsurge appeared in the county, and the progress of production has been advancing by leaps and bounds. To date, the county's early rice topdressing and cultivation has been basically completed; mid-season rice, cotton, and dryland miscellaneous grain crops have been topdressed and cultivated once; the planting plan for single-season late rice, summer sweet potatoes, and summer miscellaneous grains has been completed by 89.5%, and 65,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed and vacant areas have been used to expand the planting area.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: After completing the transplanting of early rice and harvesting spring crops, Qifengdu Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, concentrated leadership, cadres, and labor to focus on agriculture.

At the end of May, as soon as the transplanting of early rice was completed, the commune conducted a layer-by-layer investigation of the labor situation from brigades and production teams to work groups. Measures such as compression, squeezing, withdrawal, and replacement were taken to adjust more than 1,500 laborers from logistics, fisheries, community-run industries, and other industries to strengthen the agricultural front, so that the labor force used for agriculture and animal husbandry accounted for 80% of the total labor force, of which the labor force for field management accounted for 64% of the total agricultural and animal husbandry labor force. On average, there is a main laborer for every eight mu of land. The main agricultural force is guaranteed in terms of quantity and quality. Other fronts have also ensured a certain proportion of the labor force.

After the labor force was concentrated, they paid special attention to the rational arrangement of the labor force and giving play to the strengths of each person. The entire commune took field management as the center and made comprehensive and rational arrangements for various agricultural tasks. Those that should be slowed down were slowed down, those that could be arranged or not arranged were temporarily not arranged, strong laborers were used for those that required strong laborers, and semi-laborers were used for those that required semi-laborers. Auxiliary labor was also rationally matched according to needs. Some labor forces that had been improperly arranged in the past were also rearranged.

In order to completely solve the problem of labor shortage, the entire commune also launched a tool reform and technological innovation campaign. The entire commune has realized a one-stop system for field management tools, transportation of vehicles and ships, semi-mechanization of feed processing, and major reforms in cooking utensils. In this way, it not only ensures the normal production in all aspects, but also solves the labor problem.

The combination of work and rest is also well grasped. The Commune Party Committee uniformly stipulates that each commune member is guaranteed eight hours of sleep and four hours of eating and rest time a day. At the same time, 278 work sheds have been established in the fields for commune members to use during work breaks and meals. There is boiled water, salt water, and medicinal water in the work sheds.

Due to the rational arrangement of the labor force, remarkable production achievements have been made. At present, the commune has universally topdressed and cultivated its 28,000 mu of early and mid-season rice twice, and 7,600 mu have been cultivated and topdressed three times, with an average of 22 dan of high-quality fertilizer applied per mu. Out of 19,000 mu of early rice, 3,300 mu have rounded feet and are pregnant with ears, and the third-class seedlings have been basically eliminated. The number of live pigs has increased from 10,000 to 11,000. Another 1,660 mu of dryland grain crops have been expanded, and 710,000 dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. Now the masses are full of energy, and the summer production campaign centered on the field management of early and mid-season rice is in full swing.

    宁乡青壮年十分之八下田生产
    郴县栖凤渡公社从后勤  渔业、社办工业抽调人力支援农业
    新华社长沙讯　湖南宁乡县最近集中80％的干部，80％的农村劳动力和80％以上的青壮年，加强夏种和田间管理工作，使农业生产出现了新的局面。
    夏种、夏田管理开始以后，宁乡县一度出现生产进度缓慢的现象。中共宁乡县委第一书记李学良深入到夏铎铺公社联盟大队调查研究，发现当前农业生产上存在着领导精力与劳动力分散的问题。这个大队共有七百六十四个劳动力，但参加夏种、夏田管理的只占总劳力的56.5％，五十六个作业组长以上干部，领导夏种和夏田管理的只有三十二个。特别是参加夏种、夏田管理的劳力中，妇女多，男子少，半劳动力多，强劳动力少，因此影响了工效和质量。针对这一问题，县委召开了专门会议，作出了集中力量大干6、7月，夺取农业丰收的决议。县委通过摆事实，算季节，算劳力，向干部和群众进行了坚持贯彻“以粮为纲”的思想教育。各公社、大队普遍对工业、畜牧、水产、生活福利等各行各业进行了一次全面检查，合理调整了劳动力。黄材公社经过调整以后，参加农业生产的劳动力已占总劳力81.5％。全县通过合理调整和安排，共增加了农业劳动力五万六千多人。夏铎铺公社经过全面安排，从各行各业中换出青壮年劳动力两千多人，使农业生产上的青壮年劳动力由原来的五千五百多人增加到七千七百多人。
    在干部中全面实行“二五”制领导方法，提倡田间办公，不但大大改变了领导作风，密切了干部和群众的关系，也减少了非生产人员，增加了农村劳动力。现在全县一万七千五百个干部纷纷深入田间，和群众同吃同住同劳动，十七个公社和大队的办公室都搬到了生产队或田间，干部指挥田、试验田也种在后进地区和后进田里。
    由于干部带头，全党全民拧成一股劲，全县出现了热火朝天的生产高潮，生产进度突飞猛进。到目前止，全县早稻的追肥中耕已基本结束；中稻、棉花和旱地杂粮作物已进行了一道追肥中耕；一季晚稻、夏红薯、夏杂粮的播种计划已完成89.5％，并开荒和利用空坪隙地扩大播种面积六万五千亩。
    据新华社讯　湖南郴县栖凤渡公社在完成早稻插秧和收好春收作物之后，集中领导，集中干部，集中劳力，主攻农业。
    5月底早稻插秧一结束，全社就从大队、生产队到作业组，层层对劳力情况进行了调查。并采取压、挤、抽、换等办法，从后勤、渔业、社办工业等行业调整出一千五百多个劳动力，加强农业战线，使用于农业、畜牧业的劳力占总劳力的80％，其中田间管理的劳力又占农业、畜牧业劳力总数的64％。平均每八亩田地就有一个主要劳动力。从数量和质量上保证了农业主攻力量。其他各个战线也都保证了一定比例的劳力。
    劳力集中以后，他们特别注意合理安排劳力，发挥每个人的特长。全社都以田间管理为中心，对各项农活进行了全面合理安排，该缓的就缓办，可安排可不安排的就暂不安排，该用强劳动力的就用强劳动力，该用半劳动力的就用半劳动力，辅助劳力也根据需要进行合理搭配。有些过去安排不当的劳动力，也重新作了安排。
    为了彻底解决劳力不足问题，全社还开展了工具改革和技术革新运动。全社已实现了田间管理工具一条龙，运输车船化，饲料加工半机械化，炊具也进行了大改革。这样，既保证了各方面的正常生产，又解决了劳力问题。
    劳逸结合也抓得很好。公社党委统一规定保证每个社员一天有八小时睡觉和四小时吃饭休息的时间。同时在田间建立了二百七十八个工棚，供社员工间休息和吃饭时用。工棚内做到有开水、盐水、药水。
    由于劳力安排合理，生产成绩显著。当前全社二万八千亩早、中稻普遍追肥中耕两次，有七千六百亩还中耕追肥三次，平均每亩追优质肥料二十二担。一万九千亩早稻，有三千三百亩圆脚孕穗，基本消灭了三类苗。生猪已由一万头增加到一万一千头。还扩种旱地粮食作物一千六百六十亩，积肥七十一万担。现在群众干劲十足，以早、中稻田间管理为中心的夏季生产运动搞得热火朝天。
