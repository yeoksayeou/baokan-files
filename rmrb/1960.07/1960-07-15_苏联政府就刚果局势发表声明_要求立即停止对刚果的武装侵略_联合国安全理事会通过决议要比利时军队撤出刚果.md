Xinhua News Agency, July 14th, TASS Moscow, July 13th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received Belgian Ambassador Cols and American Chargé d'Affaires Freers on July 13th, and handed them the full text of the Soviet government's statement on the matter of imperialist armed intervention in the independent Republic of the Congo.

　　The statement mentioned that the Soviet government warns that the leading groups of Western countries that launched armed aggression against the Congo bear serious responsibility, and the Soviet government firmly demands an immediate end to the armed aggression.

　　The Soviet government believes that a serious situation has formed in the Congo, threatening peace and the security of all peoples. Under these circumstances, the United Nations should take urgent measures to stop the aggression and fully restore the sovereignty of the independent Republic of the Congo.

　　The statement pointed out that Belgium is using its troops to conduct military operations on Congolese territory, and is sending more and more troops into the Congo, despite the Congolese government's protests. This is a gross violation of the inviolability and political independence of Congolese territory, and is carrying out activities that have long been recognized by international law as acts of aggression.

　　At the same time, the fact that the Belgian government is also sending troops stationed in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany under the command of the NATO headquarters to the Congo once again demonstrates the role played by the aggressive NATO bloc, acting as an international gendarme, in the colonialist oppression of the African people.

　　The statement pointed out that the Adenauer government directly participated in the colonialists' conspiracy against the young Republic of the Congo, just as it did during the Anglo-American aggression against Lebanon and Jordan in July 1958, by providing its air bases to transport foreign troops to independent Congo.

　　The British leadership is directly involved in the armed intervention in the Republic of the Congo, using the regime of its dependent territories.

　　The statement said that the Portuguese government, known for its barbaric atrocities in African colonies such as Angola and Mozambique, is concentrating troops in the border area of Angola bordering the Congo.

　　The statement said that attention must be paid to the news that the US Ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, is currently in Leopoldville, interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic of the Congo, and using the opportunity of the visit of UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche (an American) to formulate plans for Western countries to usurp the name of the United Nations to expand interference in the Congo.

　　The statement emphasized that no tricks of the colonialists can hide the fact of their armed aggression against the Congo, which is the most serious violation of the basic principles of the United Nations and the Bandung principles.

　　The statement pointed out that the colonialists are now trying to sever the richest provinces from the Congo in order to dismember and strangle the young republic.

　　The statement emphasized that the colonialist intervention in the Congo once again proves that some countries, primarily the United States, continue to follow the dangerous path of aggression and provocation.

　　The statement said that the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries resolutely condemn the perfidious aggression against the Republic of the Congo. The Soviet Union fully supports the just demands of the African independent states' conferences in Accra and Addis Ababa for immediate independence for all African countries and peoples still under the shameful colonialist system.

　　The Soviet government's statement was also delivered to British Ambassador Sir Reilly, French Ambassador Dejean, and Chargé d'Affaires Nork of the Federal Republic of Germany, and was sent separately to all embassies and legations in Moscow.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 14th, TASS New York: The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on the 13th to discuss the situation in the Republic of the Congo. The Security Council passed a resolution proposed by Tunisia with eight votes (Britain, France, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique abstaining), demanding that the Belgian government withdraw its troops from the Republic of the Congo. The resolution authorized the UN Secretary-General to provide "military assistance to the Congolese government until the Congolese government considers that it is able to fully realize its tasks with the technical assistance of the United Nations."

　　苏联政府就刚果局势发表声明
　　要求立即停止对刚果的武装侵略
　　联合国安全理事会通过决议要比利时军队撤出刚果
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯13日接见了比利时大使科耳斯和美国临时代办弗里尔斯，并把苏联政府就帝国主义武装干涉独立的刚果共和国一事发表的声明全文交给了他们。
    声明谈到，苏联政府警告，对刚果发动武装侵略的西方国家的领导集团负有严重的责任，苏联政府坚决要求立即停止武装侵略。
    苏联政府认为，在刚果形成了威胁着和平和各国人民安全的严重局势，在这种情况下，联合国应该采取紧急措施，以制止侵略和完全恢复独立的刚果共和国的主权。
    声明指出，比利时利用自己的军队在刚果领土上进行军事行动，并且不顾刚果政府的抗议派遣越来越多的军队进入刚果境内，这就是粗暴地侵犯了刚果的领土的不可侵犯性和政治独立，也就是在进行早就被国际法认为是侵略行动的那些活动。
    与此同时，比利时政府还派遣由北大西洋公约组织司令部所管辖的、驻扎在德意志联邦共和国领土上的军队前往刚果，这一事实再一次表明，充当国际宪兵角色的北大西洋公约组织侵略集团在对非洲人民进行殖民主义压迫中起着怎样的作用。
    声明中指出，阿登纳政府直接参加了殖民主义者反对年轻的共和国刚果的阴谋，正像在1958年7月美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦时期一样，它提供自己的空军基地来调运外国部队到独立的刚果。
    英国领导集团对武装干涉刚果共和国有直接关系，它利用了附属于它的领地的政权。
    声明中说，以对安哥拉和莫三鼻给等非洲殖民地采取野蛮暴行而闻名于世的葡萄牙政府，在安哥拉同刚果接壤的边境地区集结军队。
    声明说，对下面这样的消息不能不加以注意：美国驻刚果大使廷伯累克现在正在利奥波德维尔，干涉刚果共和国的内政，并且利用联合国副秘书长本奇
  （美国人）访问那里的机会，制定西方国家盗用联合国的名义扩大干涉刚果的计划。
    声明着重指出，殖民主义者的任何花招都不能隐瞒他们武装侵略刚果的事实，这种侵略是对联合国的基本原则和万隆原则的最严重的破坏。
    声明中指出，殖民主义者现在力图从刚果割裂最富饶的省份，以便支解并扼杀年轻的共和国。
    声明中强调指出，对刚果的殖民主义干涉再一次证明，一些国家、首先是美国，继续走着侵略和挑衅的危险道路。
    声明中说，苏联以及其他爱好和平的国家坚决谴责对刚果共和国的背信弃义的侵略。苏联完全支持在阿克拉和亚的斯亚贝巴举行的非洲独立国家会议关于立即给予还处在可耻的殖民主义制度下的一切非洲国家和人民以独立的正义要求。
    苏联政府的声明同时交给了英国大使赖利爵士、法国大使德让、德意志联邦共和国临时代办诺克，并分别致送驻莫斯科的所有大使馆和公使馆。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约电：联合国安全理事会13日举行紧急会议，讨论刚果共和国局势问题。安全理事会以八票（英国、法国和蒋介石分子弃权）通过了突尼斯提出的决议，要求比利时政府把自己的军队撤出刚果共和国。决议授权联合国秘书长向“刚果政府提供军事援助，直至刚果政府认为它在联合国的技术援助下能够完全实现自己的任务为止”。
