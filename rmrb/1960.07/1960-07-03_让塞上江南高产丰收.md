Let the Border Region South of the Yangtze River Achieve High Yields and Abundant Harvests
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Department of Agriculture Director Zhang Xing

"Of all the places under heaven, Ningxia is enriched by the Yellow River." This saying vividly illustrates the superior natural conditions of the Ningxia Yellow River Plain. However, before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, water conservancy facilities were in disrepair, lakes were interconnected, and alkaline lands were everywhere. Agricultural production suffered severe damage, with wheat and rice yields of only a little over one hundred catties per mu. The rich and beautiful "Border Region South of the Yangtze River" presented a desolate scene. At that time, the farmers said, "Ningxia Plain, watered fields, year after year of planting and harvesting, yet no food or clothing, how can we blame heaven!"

In the past ten years, agricultural production on the Ningxia Yellow River Plain has developed rapidly. The irrigated area has expanded from 1.5 million mu to 3.22 million mu, and the total grain output has increased more than four times compared to 1949. In particular, the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 rapidly propelled agricultural development to a new stage. The per mu grain yield in the plain's paddy fields increased from 250 catties in 1957 to over 400 catties in 1959. The average annual growth rate of grain yield per unit area was 20.3%, nearly four times the average annual increase of 4.7% in the eight years before 1958. With the increase in production and the change in the natural landscape, the people's spiritual outlook has also undergone profound changes. The broad masses of Hui and Han people are full of vigor, high in morale, closely united, and advancing hand in hand. On this vast eight hundred li plain, they are working diligently for a better future.

The facts since liberation, especially the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, eloquently demonstrate that only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, only under the socialist system based on the public ownership of the means of production, and after eliminating exploitation, can the working people engage in selfless labor with a sense of ownership, and fully exploit the superior natural conditions to benefit the working people. At the same time, it also proves that only by resolutely implementing the Party's general line for building socialism and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, earnestly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture centered on "soil and fertilizer," vigorously carrying out mass movements, and fully leveraging the superiority of the people's communes, can agricultural production develop at high speed. These facts further enlighten us that the potential of the land is infinite. As long as we master and apply objective laws, and fully exert our subjective initiative, we will definitely be able to achieve continuous leaps forward in agricultural production.

Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. The high-speed development of agriculture can promote the entire socialist construction to leap forward more rapidly. The industrial construction of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is developing rapidly, and the urban population is increasing sharply. The objective situation requires agricultural production, especially grain production, to quickly catch up with the needs of the overall national economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to take grain as the key link, make comprehensive arrangements, and develop diversified operations. The Ningxia Yellow River Plain, irrigated by the Yellow River, plants and harvests every year, with stable yields. Although the area is small, the potential is great and the yield is high. Although the cultivated land here accounts for less than one-third of the cultivated land area in Ningxia, the grain output accounts for two-thirds of the total output. At the same time, the main industries of the autonomous region are mostly concentrated here, and land and water transportation are very convenient, which is conducive to local supply and support to the country. After several years of production practice, the degree of soil salinity and alkalinity in the Ningxia Plain has been greatly reduced, the serious harm of wheat stem sawfly and rust has been basically eliminated, rice blast can be controlled, and improved varieties have been fully popularized. In 1959, the average per mu yield of grain crops in the Ningxia Plain reached more than 400 catties, and the average per mu yield of grain in eight counties and cities crossed the "Yellow River." This shows that as long as we further master and apply the objective laws of agricultural production, and make full use of the favorable conditions of Yellow River irrigation, it is entirely possible to rapidly build the Ningxia Yellow River Plain into a high-yield grain base in Ningxia. Now, on this leap forward basis, we strive to expand the cultivated land area of the Ningxia Yellow River Plain to more than 5 million mu in two or three years, and to increase the average per mu yield of grain in existing paddy fields to 500 to 600 catties. Together with the area of land reclaimed and planted, we strive to achieve an average grain yield of more than 400 catties per mu. By then, the total grain output will increase by nearly one time compared to the present. As long as we earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture with "soil and fertilizer" as the center, resolutely implement the policy of "more varieties, more harvests" and "high yield, more harvests," and closely integrate agriculture with animal husbandry, this plan is entirely achievable.

While striving to increase the yield per unit area, with the progress of the Yellow River Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Hub project, a large amount of wasteland on the Ningxia Yellow River Plain will be transformed into fertile land. In recent years, many mechanical farms have been established here, and a large area of wasteland has been reclaimed after the people's communes were formed. Good harvests were obtained on the land reclaimed and planted in the first year. This shows that under the conditions of Yellow River irrigation, land reclamation and expansion of planting are a shortcut to rapidly develop agriculture, and also a major aspect of implementing the policy of "more varieties, more harvests" and "high yield, more harvests." The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to adopt the method of "three-level farm management, blooming everywhere" to reclaim a large amount of wasteland. Since the spring of this year, the people on the plain, with soaring enthusiasm, have been marching towards the wasteland and demanding grain from the land, and have now reclaimed more than 700,000 mu. Agriculture and animal husbandry are a dialectical relationship of mutual dependence, mutual support, and mutual promotion. Therefore, the high-speed development of animal husbandry can, to a great extent and in a relatively short period of time, change the low-yield face of agricultural production. The development of agriculture also provides rich material conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. Practice in recent years has proved that combining planting and animal husbandry is a fundamental experience in developing agricultural production. Animal husbandry occupies an important position in the Ningxia region. According to the characteristics of Ningxia as a Hui autonomous region, in order to develop animal husbandry, we have comprehensively launched a "thirteen-raising movement" including raising sheep, cattle, donkeys, mules, horses, camels, fish, chickens, ducks, rabbits, bees, geese, etc. In terms of sheep raising, a "double shearing, multiple lambing" movement is underway. The high-yield experience of 23 ewes in the Meili Management Area of the Xiansheng Commune in Zhongwei County, which increased by 93 in one year, has become a model for the entire region. Various places are vigorously setting up cutting-edge sheep farms and establishing more high-yield base points, striving for even greater harvests of sheep. While developing the raising of sheep and other livestock, we also strengthen the breeding and reproduction of large livestock, establish a solid feed base, and vigorously develop grassland construction to change the backward state of large livestock reproduction, so that agricultural and animal husbandry production can leap forward simultaneously.

With the rapid development of various undertakings, the amount of labor used in agricultural production and construction in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has also greatly increased. In order to ensure the task of production leap forward, it is necessary to fully leverage the superiority of the people's communes, tap labor potential, improve labor organization, and vigorously carry out tool reform. Tool reform is the beginning of agricultural mechanization and the key to improving labor efficiency, and it is also a necessary way to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. At present, while vigorously carrying out water conservancy spring repairs, summer plowing, summer planting, and breeding, the tool reform movement is developing in depth. The main projects of the current reform are the ball bearingization of operating tools, the vehiculation and trainization of transportation tools, the semi-mechanization and mechanization of feed processing, and the vigorous development of ditching plows, directional blasting, and abandoning blasting. We believe that through the mass tool reform movement, fully leveraging the wisdom of the masses, not only will new creations continue to emerge, but they will also be quickly promoted and improved, further solving the difficulty of labor shortage and ensuring the continuous leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production.

Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for quickly building the Ningxia Plain into a high-yield agricultural area and realizing the Outline for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. The task of leading agricultural production mainly lies in mastering objective laws, doing everything possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, waging a tenacious struggle against nature, seizing the maximum amount of material wealth, and accelerating the process of socialist construction. We deeply realize that fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses lies first in strengthening political and ideological education, firmly establishing the confidence that man can conquer nature, establishing lofty ambitions for high-speed development of agriculture, and arming the minds of the broad masses of cadres and people with the spirit of continuous revolution. In this way, we can take the initiative step by step and win time, which makes it possible for us to create conditions for the next year's harvest this year. The natural conditions of the Ningxia Yellow River Plain are superior, with the benefit of Yellow River irrigation. As long as we make good use of this favorable condition, overcome unfavorable conditions, and constantly criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking of some people who are satisfied with the status quo, and fully exert our subjective initiative, we can ensure the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

At present, the situation on the agricultural production front in Ningxia, like other parts of the country, is extremely good. As long as we agricultural production workers hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand at the forefront of the situation, further go deep into reality, participate in production and lead production, share weal and woe with the broad masses of Hui and Han commune members, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, and firmly grasp, deeply, thoroughly, and to the end the key measures of agricultural production, we can ensure the continuous leap forward of agricultural production in 1960.

    让塞上江南高产丰收
    宁夏回族自治区农业厅厅长　张兴
    “天下黄河富宁夏”，这句话生动地说明了宁夏黄河平原自然条件的优越。但解放前在国民党的反动统治下，水利失修，湖泊连片，遍地碱滩，农业生产遭到严重的破坏，小麦、水稻亩产量只有一百多斤。富饶美丽的“塞上江南”却呈现着一片凄惨的景象，当时农民们都这样说：“宁夏川，水浇田，年种年收没吃穿，怎能怨老天！”
    十年来，宁夏黄河平原的农业生产发展很快，灌溉面积由一百五十万亩扩大到三百二十二万亩，粮食总产量比1949年增长了四倍多。特别是1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，把农业发展迅速推向新的阶段，平原上水田的粮食亩产量已由1957年的二百五十斤提高到1959年的四百斤以上，粮食单位面积产量平均每年增长20.3％，比1958年以前八年间平均每年递增4.7％的幅度，增长近四倍。随着生产的提高和自然面貌的改变，人的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。广大回、汉族人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，亲密团结，携手跃进，在这广阔的八百里平原上，为美好的将来而辛勤劳动。
    解放以来，特别是1958年和1959年大跃进的事实，雄辩地说明了只有在党和毛主席的领导下，只有在以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义制度下，消灭了剥削，劳动人民才能以主人翁的态度进行忘我的劳动，才能充分发掘优越的自然条件为劳动人民造福。同时，也证明只有坚决贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，切实执行以“土、肥”为中心的农业“八字宪法”，大搞群众运动，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，农业生产才能高速度发展。这些事实更加启示我们，土地潜力无穷，只要掌握和运用客观规律，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，就一定能够实现农业生产的继续跃进。
    农业是国民经济发展的基础。农业的高速度发展，可以促进整个社会主义建设更迅速地向前跃进。宁夏回族自治区工业建设发展很快，城市人口急剧增加，客观形势要求农业生产，特别是粮食生产必须迅速赶上整个国民经济发展的需要。因此，必须以粮为纲，全面安排，发展多种经营。宁夏黄河平原，引黄灌溉，年种年收，产量稳定，面积虽然小，潜力大，产量高。这里的耕地面积，虽然占不到宁夏地区耕地面积的三分之一，但粮食产量却占到总产量的三分之二；同时，自治区的主要工业，大部分集中在这里，水陆交通，都很方便，有利于就地供应，有利于支援国家。经过这几年的生产实践，宁夏平原的土壤盐碱程度大大降低，小麦吸浆虫和锈病的严重危害已经基本消灭，稻瘟病已可控制掌握，良种全部普及。1959年宁夏平原粮食作物，平均亩产达到四百斤以上，有八个县市粮食平均亩产跨过“黄河”。这说明只要我们进一步掌握和运用农业生产的客观规律，充分利用引黄灌溉的有利条件，把宁夏黄河平原迅速建成宁夏的粮食高产基地是完全可能的。现在我们要在这一跃进基础上，力争在二、三年内把宁夏黄河平原的耕地面积，扩大到五百万亩以上，并使现有水田粮食平均亩产达到五百斤到六百斤，加上开荒种植面积，争取粮食平均亩产量达到四百斤以上。到那时粮食的总产量将比现在增加将近一倍。只要我们以“土、肥”为中心认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，坚决贯彻多种多收和高产多收两条腿走路的方针，并使农业同牧业密切结合，这个计划是完全可以实现的。
    在努力提高单位面积产量的同时，随着黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程的进展，宁夏黄河平原将有大量的荒地变成良田。几年来这里办起了许多机械农场，人民公社化后又开垦了大片荒地，在第一年开荒种植的土地上，就获得很好的收成。这说明在引黄灌溉的条件下，垦荒扩种是迅速发展农业的一条捷径，也是贯彻多种多收和高产多收的一个主要方面。中共宁夏回族自治区委员会决定采取“三级办场，遍地开花”的办法，大量开垦荒地。从今年春天开始，平原上的人们，以冲天的干劲，向荒地进军，向大地要粮，现在已经开荒七十万多亩。农牧业是相互依存、相互支援、相互促进的辩证关系，因此高速度地发展畜牧业，就能在极大程度上和较短的时间内，改变农业生产的低产面貌。农业发展了，也就为高速度发展畜牧业提供了丰富的物质条件。几年来的实践证明：种植业和畜牧业并举，是发展农业生产的一条根本经验。畜牧业在宁夏地区占有重要地位，根据宁夏是个回族自治区的特点，我们为了发展畜牧业全面地开展了养羊、牛、驴、骡、马、驼、鱼、鸡、鸭、兔、蜂、鹅等十三养运动。在养羊方面正开展双搓多羔运动。中卫县先声公社美利管理区二十三只母羊，一年增殖九十三只的高产经验，已经成为全区的学习榜样，各地正在大办尖端羊场，树立更多的高产基点，力争羊只更大的丰收。在发展养羊等家畜的同时，还加强大牲畜的配种繁殖，建立巩固的饲料基地和大搞草原建设，改变大家畜增殖的落后状态，使农牧业生产齐头跃进。
    随着各项事业的飞跃发展，宁夏回族自治区的农业生产建设的用工量也大大增加。为了保证生产跃进的任务，必须充分发挥人民公社的优越性，挖掘劳动潜力，改善劳动组织，大搞工具改革。工具改革是农业机械化的开端和提高劳动效率的关键，也是实现半机械化和机械化的必经途径。现在，各地在大搞水利春修、夏耕、夏种和饲养业的同时，工具改革运动正在深入发展。目前改革的主要项目，是运转工具滚珠轴承化，运输工具车辆化、列车化，饲料加工半机械化和机械化，并大搞开沟犁、定向爆破和扬弃爆破等。我们相信，通过群众性的工具改革运动，充分发挥群众的智慧，不仅会不断出现新的创造，而且一定能很快地推广提高，进一步解决劳动力不足的困难，保证农牧业生产持续跃进。
    加强党的领导，是把宁夏平原很快建成为农业高产区和提前实现农业发展纲要的根本保证。领导农业生产的任务，主要在于掌握客观规律，千方百计地调动群众的积极性，向自然进行顽强的斗争，夺取最大限度的物质财富，加速社会主义建设的进程。我们深深体会到，充分调动群众的积极性，首先在于加强政治思想教育，坚定人定胜天的信心，树立高速度发展农业的雄心大志，并以不断革命精神，武装广大干部和群众的头脑。这样就可以步步主动，赢得时间，这就有可能使我们今年为下年的丰收创造条件。宁夏黄河平原，自然条件是优越的，有引黄灌溉之利，只要我们很好地利用这个有利条件，克服不利条件，并不断批判有些人满足现状的右倾保守思想，充分发挥人的主观能动性，就可以保证农业生产的持续跃进。
    目前，宁夏的农业生产战线上同全国其他各地一样，形势极好，只要我们领导农业生产的工作者，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，站在形势的前头，进一步深入实际，参加生产领导生产，与广大回、汉族社员同甘共苦，紧密依靠党的领导，把农业生产的关键措施，扎扎实实地抓起来，抓深、抓透、抓到底，就可以保证实现1960年的农业生产持续跃进。
