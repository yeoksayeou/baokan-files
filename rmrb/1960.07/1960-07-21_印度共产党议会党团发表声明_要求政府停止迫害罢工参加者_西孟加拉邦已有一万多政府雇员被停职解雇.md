Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 20th: Bupehshi Gupta, on behalf of the Indian Communist Party Parliamentary Group, issued a statement yesterday regarding the persecution of government employees participating in the strike, demanding the immediate revocation of the Presidential decree prohibiting strikes in essential services and punishing strikers. He also demanded that the government cease all persecution, unconditionally release all those arrested, and drop all cases arising from the strike.

Gupta said, "The government has arrested 15,000 government employees and others in connection with this strike, including members of parliament and state legislative assembly members, and arrests are still continuing in Delhi and Madras. Several hundred government employees have already been subjected to brutal persecution, and the same actions are expected to be taken against more people."

Gupta expressed extreme regret that the Indian government is still persisting in this practice of persecuting employees even after the strike has ended.

Although Delhi newspapers reported that the government would not take retaliatory measures against striking employees and that some of those arrested had been released, according to materials from the Joint Action Committee of West Bengal and Bombay, quoted by the Indian News Trust, more than 11,000 central government employees in West Bengal have received suspension orders or dismissal notices, and a large number of government employees have continued to be arrested in the past two days. In Bombay City alone, 5,000 people have been dismissed or suspended by the government for participating in the strike. In addition, similar actions have been taken against striking employees in states such as Kerala, Orissa, and Rajasthan.

According to the Indian News Trust, Communist Party member of parliament Hiren Mukerjee has telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, requesting him to end this "strange situation" that has arisen in West Bengal after the central government employees stopped striking.

The Indian News Trust also reported that one hundred workers at the Southeast Railway locomotive depot in Bhojudih, Bihar, have been arrested by the police for not returning to work after the Joint Action Committee of the Central Government Employees' Trade Unions decided to unconditionally end the strike.

    印度共产党议会党团发表声明
    要求政府停止迫害罢工参加者
    西孟加拉邦已有一万多政府雇员被停职解雇
    新华社20日讯　新德里消息：布佩希·古普塔昨天代表印度共产党议会党团就参加罢工的政府雇员遭受迫害事发表声明，要求立即撤销禁止在重要服务事业部门罢工和对罢工者处罚的总统法令，并且要求政府停止一切迫害，无条件释放所有被捕者，撤销一切起因于这次罢工的案件。
    古普塔说，“政府逮捕了同这次罢工有关的一万五千名政府雇员和另外一些人，其中包括国会议员和邦立法议会议员，而且目前还在德里和马德拉斯等地继续捕人。几百名政府雇员已经遭到断然的迫害，预期还会对更多的人采取同样的行动。”
    古普塔对于印度政府甚至在罢工已经停止以后仍然坚持这种迫害雇员的做法，表示极为遗憾。
    尽管德里的报纸报道说，政府不会对罢工的雇员采取报复性措施，以及释放了一些被捕者，但是据印度报业托辣斯援引西孟加拉邦和孟买的联合行动委员会的材料说，西孟加拉邦已经有一万一千多名中央政府雇员接到了停职命令或解职的通知，而且在过去两天中还继续有一大批政府雇员被捕。单单在孟买市，已经有五千人由于参加罢工而被政府解雇或停职。另外，在喀拉拉、奥里萨、拉贾斯坦等邦，也都对罢工的雇员采取了类似的行动。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，共产党议员希伦·慕克吉已经打电报给尼赫鲁总理，要求他终止在中央政府雇员停止罢工后在西孟加拉所出现的这种“奇怪的情况”。
    印度报业托辣斯还报道，比哈尔邦布霍朱代的东南铁路机车房工人，由于在中央政府雇员工会联合行动委员会决定无条件停止罢工后仍不复工，已有一百名工人被警察逮捕。
