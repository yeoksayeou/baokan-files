Praising the Advanced, Establishing Models, Driving Overall Progress
    The Shuanggang Commune Party Committee Actively Encourages Cadres to Participate in Production and Lead Production

    (Our dispatch) The cadres of Shuanggang Commune in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, adhere to the stance of ordinary laborers, sharing food, lodging, labor, and consultation with commune members. They participate in production, lead production, strengthen the ties between cadres and the masses, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, promoting the continued leap forward in various production and work endeavors.
    The Commune Party Committee has taken various measures to continuously improve the cadres' consciousness and promote the excellent work style of sharing weal and woe with the masses. First, the leadership takes the lead and sets an example. As they say, "If the secretary takes the lead, the commune members will work actively; if the cadres are in the front, the masses will rush forward." Last winter, in order to seize the season and do a good job in deep plowing and deep cultivation, more than fifty cadres from the commune and major brigades led the masses in camping in the fields and vigorously carrying out deep plowing and deep cultivation. The town head of Baishuiyang Town forgot to eat and sleep while deep plowing the soil, deeply moving the commune members and powerfully promoting the work of deep plowing. He and more than two hundred and fifty commune members fought for fifteen days and completed seven hundred and nine mu of deep plowing.
    Second, is to commend the advanced and establish models. Shi Xiansen, a member of the Commune Party Committee, insisted on participating in production and leading production, often working barefoot with the commune members. This year, he has already worked for one hundred and four days. He is very concerned about the production and life of the masses and works very diligently. The production team he is in has done a very good job in various aspects of production. The masses praised him as a "confidant" and an "agricultural expert." In order to promote this excellent work style of participating in production and leading production, the Commune Party Committee launched a "Learn from Shi Xiansen" campaign among all cadres, and everyone took Shi Xiansen as a model for their own learning. Now, except for the clerks or statisticians of the commune and brigade, all cadres are working barefoot in the fields, which has been warmly praised by the broad masses of commune members.
    After the cadres participated in labor, the Commune Party Committee comprehensively arranged labor, work, and study. Now, most commune and brigade cadres concentrate on half a day every three, six, and nine days to study the instructions of the higher authorities, exchange experiences, and study work; the rest of the time, they work and labor in the production team. At the same time, it is also stipulated that there must be "three submissions" at each meeting, that is, to submit labor manuals, work notes, and study notes each time they are concentrated. Cadres in the production team have also changed the practice of relying solely on meetings, and work is mainly carried out through people's schools. In the people's schools, the combination of politics, culture, and technology is implemented. According to the work tasks of each period, the cadres of the brigade or the secretary of the Party branch make political reports, the teachers of the people's schools teach cultural classes, and according to the production season, the cadres of the commune's technology promotion station or experienced farmers teach production technology.
    The implementation of these methods has not only enabled the implementation of various tasks, but also given the broad masses of cadres and the masses a certain amount of time to study culture and rest. More importantly, cadres can often participate in production, increase production knowledge, learn production technology, and better lead production.

### 表扬先进　树立标兵　带动全面  双港公社党委积极鼓励干部参加生产领导生产

    表扬先进　树立标兵　带动全面
    双港公社党委积极鼓励干部参加生产领导生产
    本报讯　浙江省临海县双港公社的干部，坚持以普通劳动者的姿态和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加生产、领导生产，密切了干部和群众的联系，调动了群众积极性，推动了各项生产和工作的继续跃进。
    公社党委采取了各种措施，不断提高干部的自觉性，发扬与群众共甘苦的优良作风。首先，领导带头，以身作则。正如他们说的：“书记带头干，社员积极干，干部在前头，群众向前奔。”去年冬种为了抢季节，做好深翻深耕工作，公社和各大队，有五十多个干部，带领了全社群众在田头扎营，大搞深翻深耕工作。白水洋镇镇长在深翻土中，废寝忘食，深深感动了社员，有力地推动了深翻土的工作。他和二百五十多社员，奋战十五天，完成七百零九亩深翻土任务。
    其次，是表扬先进、树立标兵。公社党委委员施贤森坚持参加生产、领导生产，经常赤着脚和社员一起劳动。今年他已劳动了一百零四天。他对群众的生产和生活十分关心，工作很踏实，他所在的生产队，各项生产都搞得很好。群众称赞他是“知心朋友”“农业专家”。公社党委为了发扬这种参加生产领导生产的优良作风，在全体干部中，开展了一个“学习施贤森”的运动，大家都以施贤森作为自己学习的榜样。现在，除了公社和大队的文书或统计员以外，所有干部都赤脚下田，因此受到广大社员的热烈赞扬。
    干部参加劳动以后，公社党委全面安排了劳动、工作和学习。现在，大部分公社、大队干部每逢三、六、九分片集中半天，学习上级指示，交流经验，研究工作；其余时间，在生产队劳动和工作。同时，还规定逢会要“三交”，即在每次集中的时候，要交劳动手册、工作笔记、学习笔记。干部在生产队也改变了专靠开会的做法，工作主要是通过民校去进行。在民校中实行政治、文化、技术三结合，根据每一个时期的工作任务，由大队的干部或党支部书记作政治报告，由民校教师上文化课，根据生产季节，由公社技术推广站的干部或有经验的农民讲生产技术。
    实行这些办法以后，不但使各项工作得到贯彻执行，而且使广大干部和群众有一定的时间学习文化和休息。更重要的是，干部可以经常参加生产，增长生产知识，学会生产技术，更好地领导生产。
