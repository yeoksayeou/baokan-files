　　"Save One Penny a Day, Three Years Adds Up to a Thousand"

　　Saving is not a strange concept to anyone. Of course, there are many ways to save. Some start with small things: dim the lights when not needed, turn off the lights when leaving; use scrap paper for drafts and good paper for final copies; bake carbon paper to reuse it, and improve the utilization rate of old envelopes, and so on. Although these are old methods, they have indeed saved a lot of wealth for the country. Saying this does not mean that we should not focus on the big picture. Focusing on the big picture is certainly important, but we should not ignore starting with the small things. We should grab the watermelon, but why shouldn't we also pick up sesame seeds?

　　However, some people think that picking up sesame seeds is a bit stingy, or even unnecessary, and even ridicule it as "sesame seedism," implying that they look down on this "insignificant" method. Comrades who say such things disdain picking up sesame seeds, but they haven't grabbed any watermelons either. As the old saying goes, "Do not refrain from doing good just because it is small." What reason do we have to oppose people's glorious act of saving national wealth?

　　Although sesame seeds are small, picking them up does not prevent us from grabbing watermelons. What's wrong with being able to grab watermelons and pick up sesame seeds at the same time? Moreover, "Save one penny a day, three years adds up to a thousand." When that time comes, sesame seeds will also turn into watermelons.

### “一日省一文、三年合一千”

　　“一日省一文、三年合一千”
　　江苏涟水高沟公社　张志光
    节约，对大家来讲并不是什么陌生的字眼。当然，节约的方法是多种多样的，从小处着手的有：无事灯小，人走灯熄；拟稿用废纸，成文用好纸；复写纸烘了再用，提高旧信封的利用率，等等。这些虽是老办法，但也确实为国家节约了不少财富。这样说，并不等于不要从大处着眼。大处着眼固然很重要，但小处着手也不应忽视。西瓜应抓、芝麻何尝不该拾？
    可是有些人认为拾芝麻未免寒酸，或者说多此一举，甚至讥笑它为“拾芝麻主义”，言下之意，是看不起这种“微不足道”的办法的。说这样话的同志，不屑于拾芝麻，可也没有抓到西瓜。古话说：“勿以善小而不为”，我们又有什么理由反对人家节约国家财富的光荣行为呢？
    芝麻虽小，拣芝麻防碍不了抓西瓜，既能抓了西瓜，又拾到芝麻，有什么不好呢。何况“一日省一文，三年合一千”，到了那时候，芝麻也会变成西瓜的。
