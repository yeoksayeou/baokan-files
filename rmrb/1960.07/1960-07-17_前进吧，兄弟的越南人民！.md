    As the sixth anniversary of the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords on July 20 approaches, the fire of the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle is burning ever brighter. The storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has swept across the entire Vietnam, from Friendship Pass to Ca Mau Point.
    In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, where the golden star red flag flutters, today, the shouts of "Down with U.S. imperialism," "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam," and "Oppose the fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959" have converged into a powerful fighting force that shakes the valleys. Whether in Hanoi, the capital of the Republic, or Viet Bac, the sacred land of resistance, in the famous coal mining area of Hong Gai, or Nam Dinh, the center of the textile industry, the broad masses of the people, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, class, political and religious beliefs, are closely united and taking action under the mobilization of these slogans. People are not only widely holding rallies and demonstrations, strongly opposing the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism, and denouncing the monstrous crimes committed by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, but also transforming anger and hatred into strength, launching new labor emulation drives and holding "anti-American labor days," to oppose the U.S.-Diem clique with practical actions. Since the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued an appeal to the whole nation on June 28, calling on the Vietnamese people to strengthen their anti-American struggle, by July 12, more than 1.25 million people in various parts of North Vietnam had participated in rallies and demonstrations against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Delegations organized by people from all walks of life have been flocking to the Hanoi office of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam to lodge written or oral protests. People severely condemn the U.S.-Diem clique for expanding armaments and preparing for war and cruelly suppressing patriotic people in South Vietnam, demand that the International Commission withdraw its erroneous conclusions on the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and on "Decree No. 10 of 1959," and demand that the U.S. aggressors get out of South Vietnam.
    Although the 17th parallel, which divides North and South Vietnam, has now become a boundary that no letter, no grain of rice, or no child can cross, and although U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have strictly blockaded everything from North Vietnam, persecuted and massacred people who yearn for the North, they cannot suppress the desire of the South Vietnamese people to drive out the U.S. aggressors and peacefully reunify their country, nor can they stop the people's struggle against the U.S.-Diem clique and their response to the actions of their brothers in the North. On the contrary, the scale and momentum of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the brutal rule of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique have become increasingly large. In My Tho City, the capital of My Tho Province, and in provinces such as Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and Ca Mau, slogans such as "Down with aggressive and bellicose U.S. imperialism!" and "Oppose Decree No. 10 of 1959!" and leaflets accusing the U.S.-Diem clique of crimes and calling on the people to rise up in resistance have appeared everywhere. In provinces such as My Tho, Ben Tre, Kien Tuong, and Kien Phong, tens of thousands of people have held demonstrations, angrily shouting slogans such as "U.S. imperialism get out!" "Down with the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem!" "Resolutely defend our land! Oppose conscription, oppose the establishment of 'agrovilles,' oppose the construction of U.S. military bases!" On the rivers of the Fifth Interzone, many rafts flowing downstream are adorned with red flags. In the skies over Saigon, balloons carrying slogans against the U.S.-Diem clique have appeared. The people in the southwestern and Central Highlands regions have waged heroic struggles against the establishment of "land development centers," and the people in Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces have fought against conscription. The people of Thua Thien Province, who were forced to move to the "land development centers" in the Central Highlands, forced the authorities to let them return home through united and resolute struggles such as strikes and hunger strikes. The people in the famous former anti-French resistance base area of Dong Thap Muoi in South Vietnam organized large-scale rallies and demonstrations under the slogans "Defend against the U.S.-Diem clique robbing the people of their land and ponds" and "Down with the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem!" Residents in many parts of Ca Mau Province have also organized to resist local reactionary organizations. The increasingly strong struggle activities of the South Vietnamese people have greatly alarmed the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. U.S. "military advisors" have also had to admit that the people's struggle "wave is making South Vietnam and the United States increasingly uneasy" and are worried that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique will be "unable to control" the situation.
    The Vietnamese people, both in the North and the South, have an immense anger and hatred towards U.S. imperialism, and their determination to fight against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, is entirely understandable. The Vietnamese people, who have suffered more than 80 years of barbarous rule by colonialists, have the most profound understanding of the pain of being oppressed, enslaved, and divided. In order to break free from the shackles of the colonialists and strive for the independence and freedom of their motherland, the Vietnamese people have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle. In particular, after Vietnam declared its independence, the French colonialists returned to provoke a war of aggression, attempting to reoccupy Vietnam. The Vietnamese people, regardless of hardship and sacrifice, united as one and resolutely resisted, finally forcing the French colonialists to end their nine-year war of aggression, sign the Geneva Accords, and recognize Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unification, and territorial integrity. According to the Geneva Accords signed in 1954, Vietnam should be peacefully reunified through a general election in 1956. It is only because of the deliberate obstruction and sabotage of U.S. imperialism that the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not been realized to this day, and the peace in Vietnam and Indochina remains unstable.
    For six years, the United States, in blatant disregard of its solemn guarantee at the 1954 Geneva Conference that it would not use force to hinder the implementation of the Geneva Accords, has continuously violated the Geneva Accords, shipping new weapons and military personnel into South Vietnam and other parts of Indochina, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam, permanently occupy South Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. base of aggression. The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," the tool of U.S. aggression for intervention and war preparations in South Vietnam, has become the overlord riding on the heads of the South Vietnamese people, issuing orders. The 2,000 U.S. military personnel have unlimited power, from training and mobilizing troops to reviewing South Vietnam's "defense" budget, firmly controlling the Ngo Dinh Diem army. The United States not only illegally shipped in large quantities of military supplies and personnel to strengthen its arms expansion and war preparation activities in South Vietnam, but also directly participated in the "sweeps" that brutally killed former resistance personnel and the bloody massacre of patriotic people. Since the ceasefire, the United States has equipped and trained 150,000 troops and 45,000 military police for Ngo Dinh Diem, in addition to 40,000 "security guards" and 100,000 "civil defense forces"; it has expanded and built as many as 57 naval and air military bases. The United States has continuously used the Ngo Dinh Diem army to launch provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia, which pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, creating a tense situation in the Indochina region. Recently, the U.S. government has even more blatantly attempted to increase its military personnel illegally entering South Vietnam in order to further turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony. And the relevant erroneous resolutions passed by the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Commission in Vietnam have played a role in helping U.S. imperialism.
    The U.S.'s criminal activities in violating the Geneva Accords have made the Vietnamese people increasingly clear that U.S. imperialism is not only the enemy of Vietnam's peaceful reunification, but also the root cause of the unstable situation in Indochina. As long as the U.S. aggressive forces remain in South Vietnam for one day, the peace and security of Vietnam and Indochina will not be guaranteed, and the peaceful reunification that the 25 million Vietnamese people urgently desire will not be realized for one day. Therefore, the struggle against U.S. imperialism is closely inseparable from the struggle for Vietnam's peaceful reunification and the maintenance of peace in Indochina. Just like the worldwide struggle against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is to safeguard and consolidate peace, to strive for and safeguard the sovereignty and independence, democratic freedom, and socialism of oppressed nations. As Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam rightly said on July 7 when talking about the international situation, "Today, the struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is one of the primary revolutionary tasks of our people and the people of the world." He also emphasized, "In order to unify the motherland, the Vietnamese people must resolutely wage a struggle against U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are the root cause of all the poverty and disasters of the people in the South today." Undoubtedly, the development of the situation in Indochina will powerfully prove that Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's judgment is completely correct. Today, every step forward and victory achieved by the Vietnamese people in their tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will promote the expulsion of U.S. imperialism from South Vietnam and all parts of Asia, and will inevitably increase the realistic possibility of peacefully reunifying Vietnam.
    Just as all greedy colonialists will not give up the colonies they have plundered, U.S. imperialism, which vainly attempts to dominate the globe, will never automatically withdraw from South Vietnam. U.S. President Eisenhower once clearly stated that the United States must not "lose" South Vietnam, otherwise "it would cause a process of collapse." He emphasized that in order to "our own (U.S.) national interests" we must continue to "aid" the Ngo Dinh Diem clique "to maintain the morale, economic progress, and military strength of Vietnam (i.e., South Vietnam)." Ngo Dinh Diem, the faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism, also shamelessly claimed time and again that "the borders of the United States have extended to the 17th parallel of Vietnam." However, U.S. imperialism's clinging to South Vietnam and its increasingly blatant interference in South Vietnam can only arouse the increasingly strong anger and resistance of the South Vietnamese people, and eventually lead to the opposite of what the United States desires. South Vietnam is another volcano under the feet of the U.S. aggressors.
    At present, the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle is very good. This year, North Vietnam will victoriously complete its Three-Year Plan, and next year it will begin its first Five-Year Plan. Along with the development of production in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the material life of the people has also been greatly improved. The brilliant achievements of socialist construction in North Vietnam are a great source of inspiration for the South Vietnamese people who are struggling to get rid of U.S. control and realize national reunification. The tireless efforts of the people of North Vietnam to build a socialist North, to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and to defend peace in Southeast Asia and the world, represent the interests of all the Vietnamese people. The North of Vietnam, which has already achieved peace, independence, and democracy, and the North of Vietnam, which is actively struggling for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and for its prosperity and strength, has naturally become the standard-bearer for the entire Vietnamese people in striving for national independence and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and has become the hope of the entire Vietnamese people. The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique can mobilize all their propaganda machines to carry out deceptive propaganda, but they can in no way cover up the slave-like life of the South Vietnamese people. The U.S.-Diem clique can formulate "Decree No. 10 of 1959" and establish special military tribunals, and can sentence those who oppose them to death without trial, but they can in no way stop the South Vietnamese people's heart from turning to the North and suppress the anti-American patriotic struggles that rise one after another. As a popular poem in Vietnam sings:
        Let us move forward, who can stop us!
        From Friendship Pass to Ca Mau Point,
        Is our common sky.
        North and South Vietnam face the same ocean.
        There is no dividing line in our hearts,
        There is only one President Ho in our hearts,
        There is only one capital in our hearts,
        There is only one motherland in our hearts—Vietnam!
    Yes, no one can stop the heroic Vietnamese people from moving forward. In the past, the Vietnamese people were able to endure pain and sacrifice, and defeat the French colonialists and U.S. interventionists through unyielding struggles, winning peace in Indochina; today, they will certainly be able to drive out the U.S. aggressors and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland through the same resolute and sustained struggle.
    Forward, brothers of the Vietnamese people!

    前进吧，兄弟的越南人民！
    随着7月20日——1954年日内瓦协议签订六周年的临近，越南人民反美斗争的怒火越烧越旺。反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴，席卷了从睦南关到金瓯滩地的整个越南。
    在金星红旗飘扬的越南民主共和国，今天，“打倒美帝国主义”、“美帝国主义从南越滚出去”和“反对1959年第十号法西斯法令”的吼声，已经汇聚成为一股震撼山谷的强大战斗力量。不论是在共和国的首都河内，或是抗战圣地越北，在著名的煤矿区鸿广，或是纺织工业的中心南定；广大人民不分性别、年龄、民族、阶层、政治和宗教信仰，纷纷在这些口号的动员下紧密团结，奋起行动。人们不仅广泛举行集会和示威游行，强烈反对美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，声讨美国—吴庭艳集团在越南南方犯下的滔天罪行；而且把愤怒和仇恨化为力量，发动新的劳动竞赛和举行“反美劳动日”，以实际行动反对美吴集团。自从越南祖国战线中央委员会在6月28日发表告全民书、号召越南人民加强反美斗争以来，到7月12日，越南北方各地已有一百二十五万多人参加反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的集会和示威游行。各阶层人民组织的代表团络绎不绝地前往越南国际监察和监督委员会河内办事处，提出书面或口头抗议。人们严厉谴责美吴集团扩军备战和残酷镇压越南南方爱国人民，要求越南国际委员会撤销它对“美国军事援助顾问团”和对“1959年第十号法令”所作出的错误结论，并要求美国侵略者滚出越南南方。
    尽管分割越南南北的十七纬线，如今已成为没有一封信、一升米或一个小孩可能逾越的界线，尽管美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团严密封锁来自越南北方的一切，迫害和残杀心向北方的人们，也无法压制越南南方人民赶走美国侵略者、和平统一祖国的愿望，也阻止不了人们反对美吴集团的斗争、响应北方兄弟的行动。相反的，越南南方的人民反对美国—吴庭艳集团残暴统治的斗争，规模和声势已越来越大。在美萩省省会美萩市，在广治、承天和金瓯等省，“打倒侵略和好战的美帝国主义！”“反对1959年第十号法令！”等标语和控诉美吴集团罪行、号召人民起来反抗的传单到处出现。在美萩、槟椥、建祥和建丰等省，成千上万的人举行示威游行，愤怒地高呼“美帝国主义滚出去！”“打倒吴庭艳卖国贼！”“坚决保卫土地！反对抓兵拉伕，反对成立‘稠密区’，反对建设美国军事基地！”等口号。第五联区的河流上，许多顺流而下的木筏插着红旗。西贡的上空，出现了带着反对美吴集团的标语的气球。南部西面和西原人民为反对成立“垦荒区”，广义、广南等省人民为反对拉伕抓兵，进行了英勇的斗争。被迫迁往西原“垦荒区”的承天省人民，以罢工、绝食等团结一致的坚决斗争，迫使当局放他们回家。越南南方著名的前抗战根据地同塔梅地区的人民，在“防备美吴集团抢劫人民的田地和池塘”、“打倒美帝国主义侵略者和吴庭艳卖国贼！”的口号下，组织了大规模的集会和示威游行。金瓯省许多地方的居民还组织起来抵制当地的反动组织。越南南方人民一天比一天强大的斗争活动，使得美国—吴庭艳集团十分惊慌。美国“军事顾问”也不得不承认，人民的斗争“浪潮正在使南越和美国日益不安”，并且担心吴庭艳集团将“无法控制”局势。
    越南南北广大人民对于美帝国主义的无比愤怒和仇恨，他们同美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团斗争的意志的坚决，是完全可以理解的。曾经遭受八十多年殖民主义者野蛮统治的越南人民，对于被压迫、奴役和分治的痛苦，有着最深刻的体会。为了挣脱殖民者的奴役枷锁、争取祖国的独立和自由，越南人民进行了英勇不屈的斗争。特别是越南宣布独立以后，法国殖民者卷土重来，挑起侵略战争，企图再度侵占越南。越南人民不惜苦难和牺牲，团结一心，坚决抗战，终于迫使法国殖民者结束了九年之久的侵略战争，在日内瓦协议上签字，承认越南主权、独立、统一和领土的完整。根据1954年签订的日内瓦协议，越南应在1956年通过普选和平统一。只是由于美帝国主义的蓄意阻挠和破坏，越南的和平统一至今不得实现，越南和印度支那的和平始终处于不稳定的状态。
    六年来，美国悍然不顾它在1954年日内瓦会议上关于不使用武力妨害日内瓦协议履行的庄严保证，不断地破坏日内瓦协议，向越南南方和印度支那其他地区运入新的武器和军事人员，企图长期分裂越南，永久霸占越南南方并把越南南方变成美国侵略基地。美国在越南南方进行干涉和准备战争的侵略工具“美国军事援助顾问团”，已成为骑在越南南方人民头上、发号施令的太上皇。美国的二千名军事人员具有从训练、调动军队直到审查越南南方“国防”预算的无限权力，牢牢地控制着吴庭艳军队。美国不仅非法运进大批军事物资和人员加强在越南南方的扩军备战活动，而且直接参与残杀前抗战人员的“扫荡”，血腥屠杀爱国人民。停战以来，美国已为吴庭艳装备和训练了十五万军队、四万五千名军事警察，此外还有四万名“保安队”和十万名“民卫队”；扩建和新建的海、空军事基地达五十七个之多。美国曾不断利用吴庭艳军队向越南民主共和国和奉行和平中立政策的柬埔寨王国发动挑衅，制造印度支那地区的紧张局势。最近美国政府更变本加厉地企图增加它非法进入越南南方的军事人员，以便进一步把越南南方变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。而越南国际委员会印度、加拿大代表通过的有关错误决议，起了帮助美帝国主义的作用。
    美国破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶活动已使越南人民越来越看清楚，美帝国主义不仅是越南和平统一的敌人，而且是造成印度支那局势不稳定的根源。美国侵略势力一天赖在越南南方不走，越南和印度支那的和平和安全就一天得不到保障，二千五百万越南人民迫切愿望的和平统一也一天不得实现。因此，反对美帝国主义的斗争同争取越南的和平统一、维护印度支那的和平是密切不可分的。正像全世界范围在进行的反对帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的斗争，就是为了维护和巩固和平、为了争取和维护被压迫民族的主权和独立、民主自由和社会主义一样。越南民主共和国范文同总理7月7日在谈到国际形势时说得好，“今天，反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，是我国人民和世界人民的首要革命任务之一。”他并且强调，“为了统一祖国，越南人民必须坚决进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。美帝国主义及其走狗是当前南方人民一切贫困和灾难的根源。”无疑的，印度支那事态的发展将有力地证明，范文同总理的这一论断是完全正确的。今天，越南人民在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行的针锋相对的斗争中，所取得的每一步进展和胜利，都将促使美帝国主义从南越和亚洲各地滚出去，都必将增加和平统一越南的现实可能性。
    就像所有贪得无餍的殖民主义者不会放弃他们掠获的殖民地一样，妄图独霸全球的美帝国主义也绝不会自动撤出越南南方。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾经明白表示，美国决不能“失掉”越南南方，否则“就会引起一个土崩瓦解的过程”。他强调为了“我们自己（美国）的民族利益”要继续“援助”吴庭艳集团，“来维持越南（即越南南方）的士气、经济进展和军事力量”。美帝国主义的忠实走狗吴庭艳，也恬不知耻地一再声称，“美国的边界已经伸延到越南的十七纬线”。然而，美帝国主义死赖在越南南方不走，对越南南方进行越来越露骨的干涉，只能激起越南南方人民日益强烈的愤怒和反抗，最后走向美国愿望的反面。越南南方是美国侵略者脚下的另一座火山。
    目前，越南人民的斗争形势很好。今年，越南北方将胜利地完成三年计划，明年开始第一个五年计划。越南民主共和国在生产发展的同时，人民的物质生活也得到了极大的改善。越南北方社会主义建设的辉煌成就，对于正在为摆脱美国控制、实现国家统一而斗争的越南南方人民来说，是感受鼓舞的伟大源泉。越南北方人民为建设社会主义的北方，为实现和平统一祖国，为保卫东南亚和世界和平而坚持不懈地进行努力，代表着全越南人民的利益。已经取得了和平、独立、民主的越南北方，正在为越南的和平统一、为它的繁荣富强而积极斗争的越南北方，自然成为全越南人民争取民族独立、和平统一祖国的旗手，成为全越南人民的希望。美国和吴庭艳集团可以调动它们的一切宣传机器进行欺骗宣传，但无论如何也掩盖不了越南南方人民奴隶一般的生活。美吴集团可以制订“1959年第十号法令”、建立特别军事法庭，可以不加审讯就判处那些反对他们的人以死刑，但他们无论如何也阻挡不了越南南方人民心向北方、压制不了此伏彼起的反美爱国斗争。正如在越南普遍流传的一首诗所歌唱的：
        我们前进吧，谁能挡住我们！
        从睦南关到金瓯滩地，
        都是我们共同的天空。
        北越、南越共临着一个海洋。
        我们的心中没有分界线，
        我们的心中只有一个胡主席，
        我们的心中只有一个首都，
        我们的心中只有一个祖国——越南！
    是的，没有人能够阻挡英勇的越南人民前进。越南人民过去既能忍受痛苦牺牲，以不屈不挠的斗争战胜法国殖民者和美国干涉者，赢得印度支那的和平；今天，就一定能够以同样坚决持久的斗争赶走美国侵略者，实现祖国的和平统一。
    前进吧，兄弟的越南人民！
