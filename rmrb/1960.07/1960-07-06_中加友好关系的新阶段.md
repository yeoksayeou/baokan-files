    A New Stage in Sino-Ghanaian Friendly Relations

    The People's Republic of China and the Republic of Ghana have officially decided to establish diplomatic relations and to exchange ambassadors. This news has been warmly welcomed by the people of China and Ghana alike. Since Ghana embarked on the path of independent development, the friendly relations between China and Ghana have grown day by day, and now the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries marks a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Ghana.

    More than three years ago, when Ghana invited our government representatives to attend the independence ceremony, *Newsweek* magazine revealed that the United States was "very unhappy" after learning that the People's Republic of China had also been invited, and the United States "suggested" inviting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is despised by the Chinese people. Now, the decision of China and Ghana to formally establish diplomatic relations cannot but deal a heavy blow to the despicable conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine the friendly relations between China and Ghana.

    For many years, the people of China and the countries of the African continent were almost isolated from each other. In modern history, this isolation was not caused by the natural obstacles of high mountains and vast oceans, but artificially created by the barbaric rule of Western colonialists over the African continent. As early as the 7th to 9th centuries AD, the Chinese and African peoples had trade and contacts under extremely difficult traffic conditions. In particular, the trade relations between North Africa and China were relatively developed. Zheng He, the great navigator of the Ming Dynasty in China, had been to some parts of Africa. However, under colonial rule, Africa, especially Black Africa, had almost no possibility of establishing close relations with China. After the Second World War, with the development of the African national independence movement and the complete liberation of the Chinese people, the relations between China and Africa entered a new era.

    The Asian-African Conference in Bandung enabled the representatives of China and many African countries to establish direct contact and understanding. Not only has the friendly exchange between the people of China and African countries increased in recent years, but China has also established formal diplomatic relations with Egypt, Sudan, Morocco, and Guinea. Our government has also affirmed the principle of establishing diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Now, China has formally established diplomatic relations with Ghana. The trend of China establishing friendly and cooperative relations with African countries, especially with an increasing number of countries in Black Africa, essentially reflects the decline of Western colonial forces in Asia and Africa, and reflects the growing solidarity of the people of Asia and Africa.

    Imperialists and colonialists fear the awakening and unity of the Asian and African people, and therefore, they try every possible means to sow discord between the Chinese people and the people of various African countries. The *Christian Science Monitor* of April 4 carried an article to provoke the unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the African people, saying that "Africans are relatively accustomed to dealing with Westerners, and despite the background of colonialism"; "To Africans, the Chinese are largely strangers," and they harbor some "traditional suspicion." In fact, this kind of provocation by U.S. imperialism is futile. Indeed, in a sense, the African people are "accustomed" to "dealing" with Western colonialists, but what kind of "dealing" is this? This is the "dealing" in which Western colonialists impose colonial enslavement and brutal national oppression on the African people, and the African people have indeed learned enough about it. As for the "strangeness" of the African people towards China, this was caused by the imperialists' news blockade and their efforts to isolate Africa from the outside world in the long past. However, today's situation is very different. The imperialist news blockade line has been broken by the wave of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism of the African people. The African people are fully capable of recognizing friends and foes from their own experience. They deeply understand the Chinese people are the most sincere and reliable friends of the people of all African countries in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and for safeguarding and striving for national independence.

    The development of friendly relations between China and African countries has a very deep foundation. The new development of friendly relations between China and Ghana is a vivid example. China and Ghana have common historical experiences and a common destiny. Both have suffered long-term plunder and oppression by imperialism. Even today, the people of our two countries still have the common task of opposing imperialism. The people of China and Ghana, the people of China and African countries, are interdependent and share weal and woe. China and Ghana, China and African countries, need to continuously strengthen friendly and cooperative relations. This is the common aspiration of the people of China and African countries. Therefore, we firmly believe that after China and Ghana formally establish diplomatic relations, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be further developed in a greater and more comprehensive way; the friendship between the people of China and Ghana will also blossom like the buds of a new spring.

### 中加友好关系的新阶段

    中加友好关系的新阶段
    中华人民共和国和加纳共和国已经正式决定建立外交关系，并且决定互派大使级外交代表。这个消息受到了中国人民和加纳人民的同声欢迎。自从加纳走上独立发展的道路以后，中加两国的友好关系日益得到发展，而现在两国的正式建交，更标志着中加两国之间的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段。
    三年多以前，当加纳邀请我国政府代表参加独立大典的时候，美国“新闻周刊”透露，美国在知道了中华人民共和国也受到邀请之后，感到
  “很不高兴”，而美国“建议”邀请为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团。现在，中加两国正式建立外交关系的决定，不能不给美帝国主义妄图破坏中加两国友好关系的卑劣阴谋以沉重的打击。
    在漫长的年代里，中国和非洲大陆各国的人民差不多是相互隔绝的。在近代历史上，这种隔绝不是高山险岭和汪洋大海的自然障碍所造成的，而是西方殖民主义者对非洲大陆的野蛮统治所人为地造成的。远在公元七世纪到九世纪，中国人民和非洲人民就在极其艰险的交通条件下进行了贸易上的交往和联系。特别是北非和中国的贸易关系曾经是比较发达的。中国明朝的伟大的航海家郑和就曾到过非洲的某些地方。但是，在殖民统治下的非洲，尤其是黑非洲，几乎没有任何可能与中国建立密切的关系。而第二次世界大战以后，随着非洲民族独立运动的发展和中国人民的获得彻底的解放，中国和非洲的关系就进入了一个新的纪元。
    万隆举行的亚非会议使中国和非洲许多国家的代表开始建立了直接的接触和了解。不仅是中国和非洲各国人民之间的友好往来这几年间日益增进，而且中国先后与埃及、苏丹、摩洛哥、几内亚建立了正式的外交关系，我国政府同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府也肯定了建立外交关系的原则。现在，中国又同加纳正式建交了。中国同非洲国家建立友好合作关系，尤其是同黑非洲越来越多的国家建立友好合作关系的这一趋势，实质上反映了西方殖民势力在亚洲和非洲的没落，反映了亚洲和非洲人民的团结日益加强。
    帝国主义和殖民主义者害怕亚非人民的觉醒和团结，因此，它们千方百计地企图挑拨中国人民和非洲各国人民之间的关系。美国“基督教科学箴言报”4月4日曾载文对中国人民和非洲人民的团结和友谊进行挑拨，它说：“非洲人相对说来是习惯同西方人打交道的，而且尽管有殖民主义这种背景”；“对非洲人来说，中国人在很大程度上是陌生人”，他们怀有什么“传统的猜疑”。其实，美国帝国主义者的这种挑拨是枉费心机的。的确，在某种意义上说，非洲人民是“习惯”同西方殖民者“打交道”的，但这是什么样的“交道”呢？这是西方殖民者把殖民奴役和残酷的民族压迫强加在非洲人民身上的“交道”，非洲人民确实已经领教够了。至于说到非洲人民对中国的“陌生”，这是在过去的漫长历史时期里帝国主义的新闻封锁和竭力使非洲与外界隔绝的政策所促成的。然而，今天的情况已大不相同了，帝国主义的新闻封锁线已被非洲人民反殖民主义、反帝国主义的浪潮冲破了。非洲人民从他们的亲身经历中是完全能够认清敌友的。他们深深地了解，中国人民是非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义，维护和争取民族独立的斗争中的最真挚最牢靠的朋友。
    中国和非洲各国的友好关系的发展，有着极其深厚的基础。中国和加纳友好关系的新发展就是鲜明的例子。中加两国具有共同的历史遭遇和共同的命运，都曾受过帝国主义的长期掠夺和压迫，而直到今天，我们两国人民仍然有着反对帝国主义的共同任务。中加两国人民，中国人民和非洲各国人民，都是休戚相关和忧乐与共的。中国和加纳，中国和非洲各国都需要不断地加强友好合作关系，这是中国和非洲各国人民的共同愿望。所以我们深信，中国和加纳在正式建立外交关系之后，我们两国的友好合作关系，必将得到更大、更全面的发展；中国和加纳两国人民的友谊也将像新春的蓓蕾一样，放出鲜艳的花朵。
