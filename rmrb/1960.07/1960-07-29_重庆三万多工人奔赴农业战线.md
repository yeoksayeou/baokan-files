A Major Achievement of the Technical Revolution: Saving a Large Number of Technicians to Support Key Enterprises and Agriculture

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 28th. Chongqing has saved more than 36,000 skilled workers from the industrial front to support agricultural production and agricultural technical transformation in the suburban districts and counties.

    Chongqing's industrial and agricultural production has seen significant leaps forward this year. How to save and rationally allocate labor is a key issue to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in both sectors. In December of last year, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the idea that industrial enterprises must allocate labor to support agriculture and key enterprises, put forward resounding slogans such as "saving manpower by relying on modernization", and promptly convened a meeting of Party Committee Secretaries of factories and mines to deploy the task of saving labor as a strategic task to Party committees at all levels. All industrial and mining enterprises warmly responded to the call of the Municipal Committee, extensively and deeply carried out the technical revolution movement, greatly improved the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, thereby saving a large amount of labor. In the first half of this year, industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city saved a total of 100,090 workers, of which more than 36,000 supported agriculture.

    The workers drawn from industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city to support agricultural production all have certain technical experience. After arriving in the countryside, they actively participated in the agricultural technical transformation movement, greatly accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. Taking Ba County as an example, after the city transferred 10,000 skilled workers back to the county, they quickly became a backbone force in agricultural technical transformation. For example, Song Zhongshu and Lin Jincheng, veteran workers from two major machinery factories in Chongqing, returned to the Yipin People's Commune in Ba County and installed and repaired many machine tools, planers, and diesel engines for processing agricultural tools within half a year, enabling these equipments to be put into production in a timely manner and manufacture a large number of urgently needed agricultural machinery. They helped the commune's farm tool processing plant establish various management systems, adjusted the labor organization, and significantly improved the work efficiency of farm tool processing. They also helped 50 farmers learn the operating techniques of turning, fitting, and the maintenance and repair of diesel engines. Xu Guoliang, a veteran worker from Chongqing Tianfu Coal Mine, helped the forging workshop of the No. 1 Agricultural Machinery Factory in Ba County manufacture trip hammers and spring hammers, mechanizing the forging workshop. At the same time, he also helped the workshop formulate process regulations and safe operating procedures, and established a regular production order, thus greatly increasing the number of blanks for gas generators, water pumps, rice transplanters and other machinery produced in the workshop. In June, they overfulfilled the task by 20%. The 10,000 workers who returned to Ba County contributed technical strength in various aspects, effectively promoting the county's agricultural technical transformation. In the first half of this year, the county manufactured and promoted more than 90,000 new-style agricultural tools for harvesting, threshing, and cultivation, saving more than 90,000 workers; installed 54 machine pumping stations with 66 machines, and newly manufactured more than 16,000 various improved water lifting tools, reaching an irrigation area of 48%. The county also built 11 small power stations.

    After industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city transferred a large number of laborers to support agriculture and key enterprises, it further promoted the technical revolution movement and the development and improvement of production in these departments, making the use of personnel in industrial and mining enterprises more rational, greatly improving labor productivity, and greatly reducing costs. Compared with the first half of this year and the same period last year, the city's labor productivity increased by 104.72%.

    The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted various effective measures to save and transfer labor. First, it adopted the method of setting targets, setting time limits, and assigning leaders, and passed the indicators for saving labor down to workshops and teams, determined the time for transfer, and assigned special personnel to be responsible. In order to ensure the timely completion of the task of transferring labor, the secretary of the Municipal Committee and the responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels personally went to the front line to help grasp the progress of the work, especially to help solve the ideological problems of some cadres who emphasized "increased production must increase manpower, and more people can do things better" and "saving has reached the top, and there is no way to dig anymore," who were unwilling to transfer labor. In the process of saving and transferring labor, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels also clearly announced and repeatedly explained to the broad masses of workers the four principles for arranging surplus personnel, namely, unchanged treatment (not reducing workers' wages and income), unchanged business (generally not leaving the business system or changing careers), supporting agriculture, and being conscious and voluntary. Because the above measures were adopted, a large number of laborers were guaranteed to be saved, transferred, and arranged simultaneously.

    For the workers transferred to support agricultural production, the relevant units also carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological and organizational work to ensure that each worker happily embarked on a new job.

### 重庆三万多工人奔赴农业战线

    技术革命的重大成果之一——节约大批技工支援重点企业和农业
    重庆三万多工人奔赴农业战线
    下乡工人在农业技术改造中大显身手，成为农村的技术骨干
    本报重庆28日电　重庆市已经从工业战线节约出三万六千多名技术工人，支援市郊各区、县农业生产和农业技术改造。
    重庆市今年工农业生产跃进的幅度都很大，如何节约和合理调配劳动力，是保证工农业全面跃进的一个关键问题。中共重庆市委在去年12月份就提出了工业企业必须抽调劳动力支援农业和支援重点企业的问题，提出了“向四化要人”等响亮口号，并及时召开了厂矿企业党委书记会议，把节约劳动力作为一项战略性任务向各级党委进行了布置。各工矿企业都热烈响应了市委的号召，广泛深入地开展了技术革命运动，大大提高了机械化半机械化自动化半自动化的程度，从而节约了大量劳动力。今年上半年，全市各工矿企业共节约十万零九千多名劳动力，除了支援重点企业外，支援农业的就达三万六千多名。
    全市各工矿企业抽调去支援农业生产的工人都有一定的技术经验，他们到农村后，积极参加农业的技术改造运动，大大加速了农业技术改造。以巴县为例，全市抽调一万名技术工人回到这个县后，很快成为农业技术改造的一支骨干力量。如原重庆市两个大机械厂的老工人宋仲书、林金城回到巴县一品人民公社，半年内安装、修理了许多加工农具用的车床、刨床、柴油机，使这些设备及时投入生产，制造出了大批急需的农业机具。他们帮助公社的农具加工厂建立了各种管理制度，调整了劳动组织，显著提高了农具加工的工效。他们还先后帮助五十名农民学会了车工、钳工和看管修理柴油机等操作技术。重庆天府煤矿老工人徐国梁帮助巴县第一农械厂锻工车间制造了夹板锤、弹簧锤，使锻工车间实现了机械化，同时还帮助这个车间制订了工艺规程和安全操作规程，建立了正规的生产秩序，因而使这个车间生产的煤气机、水泵、插秧机等机械的坯件大大增加，6月份超额20％完成了任务。回到巴县的一万名工人在各方面贡献技术力量，有力地推动了这个县的农业技术改造，今年上半年全县共制造与推广了收割、脱粒、耕作等新式农具九万多件，节约劳动力九万多个；安装机器抽水站五十四个、六十六台机器，新制各种改良提水工具一万六千多件，农田灌溉面积达到48％，全县还建成了十一个小型发电站。
    全市各工矿企业抽调大批劳动力支援农业和重点企业后，进一步推动了这些部门技术革命运动和生产的发展和提高，使各工矿企业用人更加合理，劳动生产率大大提高，成本也大大降低。以今年上半年和去年同期比较，全市劳动生产率提高了104.72％。
    中共重庆市委对节约和抽调劳动力采取了各种有效的措施。首先采取了定指标、定时间、定领导的办法，把节约劳动力的指标层层下达到车间、小组，确定抽调时间，有专人负责。为了确保按时完成抽调劳动力的任务，市委书记和各级党委的负责同志，都亲临前线，帮助抓工作进度，特别是帮助解决部分干部强调“增产必增人，人多好办事”和“节约到顶，无法再挖”不愿调出劳动力的思想问题。在节约和抽调劳动力的过程中，中共重庆市委和各级党委，还向广大职工明确宣布和反复交代了安排节余人员的四项原则，即待遇不变（不降低工人的工资收入），业务不变（一般不出业务系统、不改行），支援农业，自觉自愿。由于采取了以上各项措施，就保证了大批劳动力边节约、边抽调、边安排。
    对于抽调下来支援农业生产的工人，有关单位还进行了深入细致的思想工作和组织工作，使每个工人都愉快地走上新的岗位。
