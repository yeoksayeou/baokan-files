Beijing Highway Transportation Department Promotes the Experience of Magongzhuang Motor Vehicle Depot
    Moving Management Work to the Front Lines
    Dispatching, shift handover, refueling, vehicle maintenance and repair, technical inspections, lodging, meals, statistics, cultural activities, and leadership offices all moved to the forefront.
    (Our newspaper reports) The Beijing Highway Transportation Department is launching a revolution in enterprise management centered around "Ten Moves." The so-called "Ten Moves" are: 1. Dispatching moves; 2. Shift handover moves; 3. Refueling moves; 4. Vehicle maintenance and repair moves; 5. Technical checkpoint (vehicle inspection before work) moves; 6. Lodging moves; 7. Meals move; 8. Statistics move; 9. Cultural activities move; 10. Leading cadres' offices move. With the progress of this revolution, the appearance of highway transportation enterprises has been completely renewed, and transportation efficiency has risen sharply.

    The Highly Centralized Management Methods Contradict the Great Development of Production

    The "Ten Moves" to improve enterprise management began at the Magongzhuang Motor Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company. This depot has 140 vehicles and is one of the larger depots among the city's transportation company's eleven depots. It undertakes about one-tenth of the city's freight transportation tasks. Originally, this depot adopted a highly centralized approach to production management and transportation organization: people were concentrated, vehicles were concentrated, dispatching work was concentrated, and technical management, technical supply, and welfare work were also highly concentrated. Before the "Ten Moves," the Magongzhuang Motor Vehicle Depot often had 140 vehicles and more than 200 trailers concentrated together, resulting in extreme congestion and queuing when dispatching vehicles every day. When vehicles returned in the afternoon, they had to queue for refueling and maintenance, and repairs also required queuing. These three major queues consumed a lot of time every day. Since the depot was generally far from the loading location, vehicles returned empty after work, operating day and night in double shifts, resulting in more than 3,600 kilometers of empty runs per day, wasting time and gasoline.

    The disadvantages of high centralization were also reflected in more dispatching errors. Dispatchers sat in the office, relying on telephones and reports to grasp the situation of thousands of large and small consignment units every day, and then assigned these tasks to each driver. Several dispatchers often stayed up all night but still could not issue route permits, and dispatching errors occurred frequently.

    In terms of transportation organization, the unified dispatching of all vehicles in the depot resulted in drivers going to the eastern suburbs today and possibly to the western city tomorrow. Drivers did not know what they would be doing the next day. According to drivers, the cargo owners changed every day, the types of goods changed every day, and the running routes changed every day. Drivers had no idea what they were doing, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as "loading less, driving slowly, and wasting time asking for directions."

    The unreasonable management system also caused disharmony in interpersonal relationships, with frequent disputes, complaints, and buck-passing.

    Grasping a Key to Improving Enterprise Management

    Where did these complex and numerous problems come from? Initially, some people believed that it was because the depot's yard was too small and that it was necessary to expand the depot, increase dispatchers, and add equipment.

    Later, from analyzing and summarizing the experience of a small team in achieving high output, a correct way to solve the contradiction was found.

    Originally, in February of this year, a youth team accepted the task of transporting earthwork to the Caocheng construction site in the eastern suburbs. The depot was more than 20 kilometers away from the construction site. If, as in the past, empty vehicles were driven back to the depot every night during shift handover, one-third of the time would be wasted on the road. The young men in this team said, "Wouldn't it be better to move the vehicles and personnel to the site?" The depot leaders strongly supported their approach. Therefore, they implemented a major move of vehicles and personnel, moving eating, lodging, refueling, etc., to the site. From then on, the transportation efficiency of this team jumped to the first place in the depot. Soon, a leading cadre of the depot, after seeing the experience of a car company in Henan Province implementing "Four Moves and Eight Down the Road" in a document, suddenly realized the situation. He immediately summarized the "moves" experience of the youth team and promoted it throughout the depot. A vigorous revolution in management system and transportation organization began.

    "Ten Moves" Brought a Socialist Big Family and Great Increases in Production and Savings

    Drivers and loaders praised "Ten Moves" in unison. They said: "The 'Ten Moves' have many benefits, bringing a socialist big family, bringing a communist great collaboration, and bringing a great increase in production and great savings."

    The so-called "moves" brought a socialist big family because leading cadres, drivers, and personnel from logistics service departments all converged on the spot and came to the forefront of production. Workers said: "In the past, you had to queue to find cadres in the depot, but now cadres know about problems before you even say anything." Depot Director Li Conglin went down to the site fourteen times in the first month of implementing "Ten Moves" despite his busy schedule, and sixteen times in the second month, each time for at least half a day. The relationship between the workers in the repair department and the drivers is also different from before. In the past, the workers in the maintenance workshop often couldn't meet the drivers, making it difficult to ensure the quality of repairs; drivers often complained, and the maintenance workers also felt that the drivers were difficult to "serve." Now, the maintenance workers drive tool vehicles to the site to maintain the vehicles, and the drivers are very happy. The drivers sing: "Repairmen come to the site, drivers are overjoyed, cars take a breath, and continue to run." Drivers eat and live together every day, driving on the same road, truly as close as a family. When a new driver's car breaks down, the veteran drivers immediately stop to help repair it.

    The so-called bringing communist great collaboration is that the relationship with the owner unit has changed, truly realizing a dragon-like linkage of production, transportation, and sales. Before the "Ten Moves," the connection between the motor vehicle depot and the consignor unit was carried out by several depot dispatchers sitting in the office. Because they did not understand the situation of the production unit, they could not distinguish between urgency, and often grabbed everything at once. Now, under unified concentration on the spot, part of the dispatching power is delegated to the driver teams, and a site transportation headquarters is established mainly by the production unit, and vehicles are allocated at any time according to production needs. In this way, the dispatchers and drivers work together with the owners to collaborate, and the relationship has improved. The owners actively and frequently help drivers solve production and life problems, and the drivers actively explore transportation potential to complete transportation tasks faster and better.

    The direct effect of the above two changes is a great increase in production and savings in transportation work. Comparing the depot's transportation efficiency in May of this year with that of February before the "Ten Moves": The daily output in February was 22.58 tons, which rose to 38.86 tons in May; the monthly output per vehicle-ton in February was 5,226 ton-kilometers, which had reached 11,300 ton-kilometers in May, greatly breaking the superstition that the monthly output per vehicle-ton in urban transportation could not exceed 10,000 ton-kilometers due to short transportation distances and large traffic flow, and creating a new record in the city's freight transportation. Due to the reduction of empty runs and the avoidance of dispatching errors, gasoline has also been greatly saved. In February, more than 28,000 liters of fuel were saved, and in May, more than 115,000 liters of fuel were saved.

    "Ten Moves" Greatly Stimulated Enthusiasm in All Aspects

    In summary, "Ten Moves" solved three contradictions: First, drivers and loaders set up camp on the site, cadres went deep into the site, and under the premise of ensuring centralized and unified leadership, some management power was delegated to the site, and workers participated in management, which solved the contradiction between leaders and the masses and greatly stimulated the workers' initiative and enthusiasm. Second, the repair, service, and other logistics departments followed the drivers and loaders to the front, and everyone worked together to serve production. The contradictions of mutual incomprehension and poor collaboration in the past have been resolved. Third, the owners participated in the site transportation headquarters, which solved the contradiction between production and transportation, which were not connected to each other, which not only improved transportation capacity but also promoted production.

    The resolution of these three contradictions not only comprehensively improved the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, thereby achieving significant results in production, but more importantly, the centralized and unified leadership became much more flexible, which created important conditions for the continued development of production. In the past, from the perspective of the form of production leadership, it was centralized, and all dispatching was in the hands of the depot's dispatchers, but the actual result was that each transportation line was independent, dispatching was ineffective, and sometimes even the dispatchers could not figure out which team had potential. After the change, from the form, part of the dispatching power was delegated to the teams and sites, but because strict rules were stipulated, each site command post had to report the situation every day, and the depot dispatching room could quickly grasp the overall situation and dispatch transportation forces at any time according to the situation. In particular, since the repair and service functional departments all went to the site, the depot had a timely and detailed understanding of the situation, which greatly reduced bureaucratic tendencies in leadership. Therefore, it can be said that this change has greatly improved the depot's management level. (Photo attached)

    After the Magongzhuang Motor Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Motor Transportation Company implemented "Ten Moves," leading cadres often went deep into the transportation site to personally understand and solve various problems.

    北京公路运输部门推广马公庄汽车场经验
    管理工作搬到现场去
    调度、交接班、加油、保养和修理车辆、技术检查、住宿、吃饭、统计、文化活动、领导办公都搬到第一线
    本报讯　北京市公路运输部门正在掀起一个以“十搬家”为内容的企业管理工作的大革命。所谓“十搬家”，即：一、调度搬家；二、交接班搬家；三、加油搬家；四、保养和修理车辆搬家；五、技术把关（即上班前对车辆进行检查）搬家；六、住宿搬家；七、吃饭搬家；八、统计搬家；九、文化活动搬家；十、领导干部办公搬家。随着这场革命的进行，公路运输企业的面貌焕然一新，运输效率直线上升。
    大集中的管理方法和生产大发展有矛盾
    “十搬家”改进企业管理的方法，开始于北京市运输公司马公庄汽车场。这个汽车场共有一百四十部汽车，是市运输公司十一个汽车场中较大的车场之一，它担负着本市十分之一左右的市内货运任务。原来这个场在生产管理和运输组织上，采取了大集中的办法：人集中、车集中、调度工作集中，技术管理、技术供应、生活福利工作等也统通大集中。在“十搬家”以前的马公庄汽车场，经常是一百四十部汽车和二百多辆挂车集中在一起，每天出车的时候，拥挤不堪，排队等候。下午收车回来的时候，又要排队等加油、保养，修车也要排队。这三大排队，每天耗去了大量的时间。由于车场离装货地点一般比较远，车辆下班空驶回场，日夜双班，一天就空驶三千六百多公里，白白浪费了时间和汽油。
    大集中的缺点，还表现在调度工作上的失误比较多。调度员坐办公室，每天靠电话和表报掌握数以千计的大小托运单位的情况，然后把这些任务分配给每个司机。几个调度员经常彻夜不眠，还发不出路签，调度失误现象经常发生。
    在运输组织上，由于采取全场车辆统一调度大循环，结果是司机今天去东郊，明天又可能去西城，今天不知道明天干什么。据司机反映，货主一天一变，货物品种一天一换，运行道路一天一线，每天开着车心里一点底都没有。因此，造成：“装的少，走的慢、停车问路费时间”的不合理现象。
    管理制度的不合理，还造成人与人关系上的不协调，争执、埋怨、扯皮现象比较多。
    抓到了一把改进企业管理的钥匙
    如此复杂、繁多的问题，来源于何处？起初有人认为，是因为车场的院子太小了，只有扩建车场，增加调度人员和增加设备才行。
    后来，从分析总结一个小队实现高产的经验中，才找到了一条正确的解决矛盾的道路。
    原来今年2月，这个场有一个青年小队接受了去东郊草场工地运土方的任务。车场离这个工地有二十多公里，如果像过去一样，每天晚上交接班的时候开着空车回场来，三分之一的时间都浪费在路上。这个队的小伙子们说，“车辆、人员搬到现场去不好吗？”场领导很支持他们的作法。于是，他们实行了车辆人员大搬家，吃、住、加油等都搬到现场去。从这以后，这个小队，运输效率一跃成为全场第一。不久，场的一位领导干部，从一份材料上看到河南省一个汽车公司实行“四搬家、八下路”的经验以后，思想豁然开朗。马上总结了青年小队“搬家”的经验，在全场大推广。一场轰轰烈烈的管理制度和运输组织的大革命，就这样开始了。
    “十搬家”搬来了社会主义大家庭搬来了大增产大节约
    司机和装卸工人齐声称赞“十搬家”。他们说：“十搬家的好处多，搬来了一个社会主义的大家庭，搬来了一个共产主义大协作，搬来了一个大增产、大节约”。
    所谓“搬家”带来了一个社会主义大家庭，因为领导干部、司机以及后勤服务部门的人员，大家现场会师，他们都来到了生产第一线。工人们说：“过去在场里找干部得排队，现在有问题还没说干部就知道了”。场长李丛林在工作很忙的情况下，实行“十搬家”的第一个月就下去了十四次，第二个月下去了十六次。每次最少半天。修理部门的工人与司机的关系同以前也不一样了。过去保修车间的工人经常和司机见不了面，很难保证修车质量；司机常埋怨，保修工人还嫌司机难“侍候”。现在保修工开着工具车到现场保修车辆，司机非常高兴。司机歌唱道：“修理工现场来，司机乐开怀，汽车喘口气，接着跑起来”。司机之间，每天吃饭、住宿在一起，开车在一条路上走，真是亲如一家人。新司机的车出了毛病，老司机马上停车帮助修理。
    所谓带来了共产主义大协作，是与业主单位的关系改变了，真正实现了产、运、销一条龙。“十搬家”以前，汽车场与托运单位的联系是由几个场调度员坐在办公室里进行的。由于不了解生产单位的情况，分不清缓急，经常是一把抓。现在，在现场集中统一下，部分调度权下放到司机小队，并且以生产单位为主成立了现场运输指挥部，根据生产需要随时调配车辆。这样一来，调度员和司机一起共同与业主搞协作，关系改善了。业主主动经常积极帮助司机解决生产和生活上的问题，司机积极发掘运输潜力，更快更好地完成运输任务。
    由于以上两种关系的改变，所带来的直接效果是运输工作上的大增产大节约。全场运输效率，以今年5月份和“十搬家”以前的2月份相比较：2月份日产二十二点五八吨，5月份上升为三十八点八六吨；2月份车吨月产五千二百二十六吨公里，5月份已经高达一万一千三百吨公里，大大突破了所谓城市运距短、车流大，运输车吨月产不可能超过万吨公里的迷信，在本市货运方面创造了新纪录。由于减少了空驶，避免了调度上的差错，汽油也大大节约了，2月份共节油两万八千多公升，5月份节油十一万五千多公升。
    “十搬家”大大发挥了各方面的积极性
    “十搬家”归结起来，是解决了三个矛盾：第一，司机和装卸工人在现场安营扎寨，干部深入现场并且在保证集中统一领导下，把部分管理权力下放到现场，由工人参加管理，这就解决了领导与群众的矛盾，大大发挥了工人的主动性积极性。第二是修理、服务等后勤部门跟着司机、装卸工人到前方，大家共同为生产服务。过去互不了解、协作不好的矛盾得到解决。第三，业主参加现场运输指挥，解决了生产与运输互不衔接的矛盾，既提高了运力，也促进了生产。
    这三个矛盾的解决，不仅全面提高了工人群众的积极性，从而在生产上获得了显著效果，更重要的是领导上的集中统一调动灵活得多了，这就为生产的继续发展创造了重要条件。过去从生产领导的形式上看，是集中的，一切调度抓在场的调度员手中，但是实际的结果，是各个运输线上各自为政，调度不灵，有时连调度员也弄不清哪个小队有潜力。改变办法以后，从形式上看，一部分调度权下放到小队和现场，但是由于规定了严格的制度，各现场指挥所必须每日汇报情况，场部调度室很快就可以掌握全面情况，并且根据情况随时调度运输力量。特别是由于修理、服务职能部门都下现场，场部对情况了解得既及时又细致，这就大大减少了领导上的官僚主义。因此，可以说这一改变使场的管理水平大大提高了一步。（附图片）
