A Party Secretary's Notes

    Barren Land Transformed into a Brocade of Splendor
    Wang Zhan'ao, First Secretary of the CCP Guangdong Dianbai County Committee

    "Before the rain stops, the soil dries, ten days of sun scorch people; when the wind blows, sand and dust blot out the sun, good fields turn into hills." This is a folk song that has been circulating in Dianbai for many years, and it is also a true reflection of the natural appearance of this place in the past.

    Before liberation, the forest area in the entire Dianbai County accounted for less than 1% of the total land. The forests in the northern mountainous area were severely damaged, and only jagged, angry rocks remained on the towering mountains. In the central hilly area, mountains collapsed and ridges eroded, the soil was parched and the land cracked, and soil erosion was extremely serious; the yellow mud water, which farmers called "tigers in the fields," devoured large amounts of farmland every year. The southern coast was a vast expanse of white sandy beaches, where the autumn and winter winds brought sandstorms that blotted out the sun, and the summer was like a burning fire, making people reluctant to approach, calling it the "poisonous sand mother." Due to the scarcity of forests and the disrepair of water conservancy, the agricultural production level in Dianbai County had always been very low and extremely unstable. The yield of rice per mu was only a few dozen jin. Coupled with the exploitation by the reactionary ruling class, the people's lives were extremely impoverished, and there were famines every year. It was a well-known old disaster area.

    However, take another look now. In front of you, what rapid and enormous changes have taken place!

    You will not recognize the 500,000 mu of barren mountains in the northern region. Now, it is a place of picturesque scenery, lush forests, and tea oil everywhere. You will also not recognize the boundless, collapsing mountains and bald ridges in the central hilly area. After large-scale afforestation, the area of soil erosion has been effectively controlled, which has protected the surrounding farmland, enabled single-cropping to be changed to double-cropping or triple-cropping, and restored the youth of the farmland swallowed by mud and sand. As for the coastal areas, with the construction of shelterbelts, the rampant "poisonous sand mother" has finally been tamed. The people and farmland near the forest belt have been freed from the threat of wind and sand, the farmland that was submerged in the past has been restored to cultivation, and the reclaimed wasteland has been converted from single-cropping to double-cropping. In addition, firewood can be harvested every year, which has initially solved the masses' difficulty in lacking fuel. Many people who originally planned to relocate can now live and work in peace.

    In the early days of liberation, the county had to rely on the state to import grain from other places every year. Thanks to conquering drought and sandstorm disasters, the county's grain output has increased year by year. By 1958, it was able to become self-sufficient, and in 1959, it became a surplus grain county, exporting rice for the first time. The painful years of "eating wild vegetables for three meals and burning firewood past midnight" that the masses experienced before liberation have become a thing of the past forever.

    This profound change was not smooth sailing; it involved an arduous journey and the dedication of hard work.

    In the spring of 1956, the people of Bohe Port first responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "green the motherland." They held a誓师大会 [pledge rally] on the beach, and millions of people raised their giant arms and shouted:
  "We must make the wind and sand bow their heads, and make the land turn over!" Then, according to the traditional customs of fishermen going to sea, three gongs were struck, and 159 Communist Party members led a labor army of more than 5,000 people to the vast sandy beach.

    Planting trees on the beach was indeed difficult. But no amount of difficulty could match the people's soaring drive and infinite wisdom. If there was no technology, they offered advice; if they failed, they tried again; if there were no seedlings, they grew their own! When the men went to sea, the women took up the burden. If there were no hoes, they used pot shovels to dig holes; if there were no wooden dippers, they used shells to water the seedlings; if there were no manure baskets, they used buckets to transport mud. The beach lacked fresh water, so they dug dozens of pools on the beach, using shells to scoop up the seeping fresh water to water the seedlings.

    The communist style of helping others, sacrificing oneself for others, and everyone supporting each other in times of difficulty was even more touching. The shock brigade composed of young women from Bohe Town not only chose the driest and most windy areas to plant trees, but also brought rice and bedding to support tree planting in the X溝 [new trench] area, which was more than ten li away and had the most sand dunes.

    Whether the planted trees could survive was another arduous struggle. People carried out arduous and meticulous work: supporting seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing, cultivating soil, fighting drought, and eliminating insects, managing the seedlings as carefully as they managed rice. The sweat was not shed in vain, and the labor bore fruit. In just about two years, more than 800,000 Casuarina trees planted along the coast of Bohe, like a green Great Wall by the sea, tightly surrounded the barren sand.

    This brilliant example sounded the clarion call for the entire county to march towards nature. In the area near Shuidong Town, where soil erosion was the most serious, people set off a upsurge of "learning from Bohe, catching up with Bohe, and surpassing Bohe." The tree planting army, composed of more than 5,000 people, including cadres, teachers, students, residents, and troops from the whole town, marched to the collapsing mountains and rotten ridges from the morning of the Spring Festival in 1957, mightily and with high morale, braving the cold wind and rain. In Dapi, where tree planting was the most difficult, thousands of people were hoeing on the bare hills. There were many stones and hard mud on the mountain. One hoe could only dig a little mud skin, and stones flew up. One hoe was a battle, and one hoe was a difficult hurdle. More than 40 hoes were broken in two days. Wang Yutang, a poor peasant commune member in his seventies, heard the news of the greening and brought his son, daughter-in-law, and the whole family to the mountain, even bringing bedding and cooking utensils to the mountain. With more people and greater strength, difficulties had to give way. People engraved bold verses on the stones:
  Chairman Mao called for greening, heroes make this place their home,
  Hard work crushes stubborn rocks, barren mountains become forest mansions,
    Hoes create the world, Dapi is full of flowers.

    After several years of hard work, the forty-kilometer coastline of the two peninsulas of Bohe and Nanhai has achieved four belts (Casuarina belt, bamboo belt, fruit belt, mangrove belt) and fiveizations (greening, bambooization, fruitization, mangroveization, beautification); the county has planted more than 90,000 mu of fruit trees and built 623 hundred-fruit gardens, realizing the hundred-fruit gardenization of every commune and team; tree-lined avenues have been formed along both sides of the county's roads; bamboo belts have grown along both banks of the county's 95 large and small rivers, becoming "bamboo dikes" to protect the banks of farmland; shelterbelts have also been created along the entire coastline.

    Do you remember the old folk song mentioned at the beginning of this article? Now, how do the people of Dianbai sing it?——The people of Dianbai have high aspirations, transforming barren mountains and red ridges into green robes, flowers and fruits fill the garden, and green shade is beautiful, the strong wind and flying sand all lower their heads. Agriculture and animal husbandry have greatly increased production year after year, living and working in peace and contentment forever, the mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful, like a paradise, the earth is like spring, a brocade of splendor...

### 不毛之地变为一片锦绣

    不毛之地变为一片锦绣
    中共广东电白县委第一书记　王占鳌
    “天雨未晴土先干、十日太阳旱煞人；风来沙尘蔽天日，大好园田变山岗”。这是多年来流传在电白民间的一首歌谣，也是这个地方过去自然面貌的真实写照。
    解放前夕，电白全县土地中，树林面积还不到1％。北部山区的森林，受到严重的破坏，巍峨的大山上，只剩下一片嶙峋怒石。中部丘陵地带，山崩岭烂，土焦地裂，水土流失极其严重；农民称为“田间老虎”的黄泥水，每年都要吞噬大批耕地。南部沿海，又是一片白茫茫的沙滩，秋冬风沙蔽日，夏季如同火焚，人们望而却步，说是“沙母毒龙”。由于林木稀少，水利失修，电白县的农业生产水平一向很低，而且极不稳定，稻谷亩产只得几十斤，加上反动统治阶级的盘剥，人民生活极端穷苦，年年都要闹灾荒，是一个有名的老灾区。
    然而，现在你再来看看吧。在你的眼前，发生了多么迅速和多么巨大的变化！
    你将会认不出北部地区那五十万亩昔日的荒山了。现在，这里已经是山明水秀，林木葱茏，茶油遍地。你也将会认不出中部丘陵地带那一望无际的崩山秃岭了。这里经过大规模绿化以后，水土流失面积已被有效地控制起来，使周围农田得到了保障，并使其中的单造改为双造或三造，被泥沙吞噬了的农田也恢复了青春。至于沿海一带，随着防护林带的筑成，猖獗的“沙母毒龙”也终于被驯服了。林带附近的人民和农田解除了风沙威胁，过去被淹没的农田恢复了耕种，开垦的荒地，单造田改为双造。此外，每年还可收获柴薪，初步解决了群众缺乏燃料的困难。许多原来打算迁居的人们可以安居乐业了。
    解放初期，全县每年要靠国家从外地调入粮食。由于征服了干旱和沙荒灾害，全县粮食产量逐年增长，到1958年已能自给，1959年更变为余粮县，破天荒地调出了大米。解放前群众那种“野菜度三餐，烧火过五更”的辛酸岁月，已经永远成为过去。
    这个深刻的变化并不是一帆风顺的，其间经过了艰苦的历程，付出了辛勤的劳动。
    1956年春天，博贺港的人民群众首先起来响应毛主席“绿化祖国”的伟大号召。他们在海滩上面开誓师大会，千百万人举起巨臂喊道：
  “我们一定要风沙低头，要土地翻身！”接着，按照渔民出海的传统风俗，鸣锣三响，一百五十九个共产党员带领着五千多人组成的劳动大军，奔向白茫茫的沙滩。
    要在沙滩上种树，困难的确很多。但是再大的困难也敌不过人民群众的冲天干劲和无穷智慧。没技术，献计；失败了再来；没树苗，自育！男人出了海，妇女便把担子担起来。没有锄头，就用锅铲来挖穴，没有木瓢就用螺壳来浇水，没有粪箕就拿水桶来运泥。海滩缺乏淡水，又在沙滩挖了几十个水潭，用螺壳一壳一壳地把渗出的淡水盛起来淋树苗。
    助人为乐，舍己为人，一处困难，大家支援的共产主义风格更令人感动。博贺镇青年妇女组成的突击队不仅挑最干旱最当风的地带种树，而且带了米粮，背着铺盖到十里外沙丘最多的新沟地区支援种树。
    种下去了，能不能成活，又是一场艰巨的斗争。人们进行了艰苦细致的工作：扶苗、补苗、追肥、培土、抗旱、灭虫，像管理水稻一样细心地管理着树苗。汗水没有白流，劳动结了硕果。只不过将近二年时间，沿博贺海岸种下的八十多万株木麻黄树，真的像海滨的绿色长城一样，把荒沙紧紧地包围起来了。
    这个光辉的范例，吹响了全县向大自然进军的号角。水土流失最严重的水东镇附近一带，人们掀起了“学博贺、赶博贺、超博贺”的热潮，全镇机关干部、师生、居民、部队等五千多人组成的造林大军，从1957年春节早晨起，浩浩荡荡，斗志昂扬，冒着寒风冷雨，向崩山烂岭进军。造林最困难的大陂一带，千百万群众在光秃的山岗上锄地，山上石多泥硬，一锄下去只能挖开一点泥皮，石子飞起，一锄是一个战斗，一锄是一个难关，两天中就挖断了四十多把锄头。七十多岁的贫农社员王育堂听到绿化消息，把自己的儿子、媳妇一家人都带上了山，连铺盖、炊具也带上山来。人多力量大，困难只好退让。人们在石块上刻下了豪迈的诗句：
  毛主席号召绿化，英雄此地为家，
  干劲冲碎顽石，荒山变为林厦，
    锄头打出天下，大陂一片鲜花。
    经过几年的苦战，博贺、南海两个半岛的四十公里长的海岸线上已实现了四带（木麻黄带、竹带、果带、红树带）五化（绿化、竹化、果化、红树化、美化）；全县已共种上果树九万多亩，建百果园六百二十三个，实现了社社队队百果园化；全县公路两旁都形成了林荫大道；全县九十五条大小河流两岸，都长起了竹林带，成为保护河岸农田的“竹堤”；海岸线也全都营造了防护林带。
    你还记得这篇文章开头提到的那首旧日的歌谣么？现在，电白人民又是怎样唱的呢？——电白人民志气高，童山赤岭换绿袍，花果满园绿荫丽，狂风飞沙尽低头。农牧连年大增产，安居乐业永无忧，山明水秀天堂艳，大地如春锦绣图……
