Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 23rd: All cadres of the Liangyang Coal Mine in Guangdong Province are implementing "Four Arrivals at the Coal Pit" (meaning laboring at the coal pit, working at the coal pit, holding meetings at the coal pit, and solving problems at the coal pit), truly achieving both participation in production and leadership in production, acting as both commanders, propagandists, and combatants. For more than a month, many key production problems have been resolved on the production site, and many meetings have also been held on the production site, making problem solving fast and effective, and effectively promoting production development.

The Liangyang Coal Mine began implementing the "Four Arrivals at the Coal Pit" measures in May of this year. Because they implemented the practice of division of labor with individual responsibility, focusing on key points, focusing in-depth, and following through to the end, the work style of cadres has undergone fundamental changes. All cadres regard the coal pit as their home, and spend about two-thirds of their time participating in and leading production every day. For more than a month, many key production problems have been resolved promptly on the front line of production. For example, in early May, the Kongtong Work Area had heavy rains, and the No. 5 coal pit, which accounted for one-third of the mine's output, was flooded. The general branch secretary of the mine's work area, Ao Jingren, took the lead in the battle to block the water at this critical moment. He stayed at the pit entrance for thirteen days and nights in a row, and held three "three-in-one" meetings with technicians, workers, and cadres at the pit entrance. After two failures, he finally accepted the workers' suggestion of opening a drainage ditch and using concrete to block the water seepage, finally conquering the flood and allowing the coal pit to resume normal coal production ahead of schedule.

After the cadres "Four Arrivals at the Coal Pit," many meetings related to production issues were held directly at the production site, which not only shortened the meeting time, but also solved problems quickly and effectively. Deputy Director and Party Committee Office Director Lin Zhide, after freeing himself from administrative affairs in the office and going deep into the No. 4 coal pit, discovered that the coal seam had suddenly changed. If they continued to dig a level tunnel, they would have to excavate seven or eight meters of rock, and it would take six or seven days to produce coal. He convened a meeting of the work area director, section and work team cadres on the spot, and after analysis, decided to dig an inclined shaft in the level tunnel. As a result, coal production continued that same day. The workers reflected that if the leading cadres had not specifically studied the issue on the spot and taken the problem to the office, it might not have been solved well in two days.

Cadres directly participate in labor, and have more time to contact workers. Many leading cadres have made close friends with workers, and a new atmosphere of leaders caring for workers and workers cherishing leaders has emerged. After Liu Wenyuan, Deputy Director of Liangyang Coal Mine, went deep into the Dajinxing Work Section, he found that the construction site was far from the canteen. He immediately mobilized cadres and cooks to deliver meals to the construction site, reducing the time workers spent running back and forth to eat and allowing them to rest better. Liu Wenyuan cared for the workers' lives in every possible way and became the workers' confidant. Workers reported everything to him, which made problems quickly discovered and quickly resolved, greatly promoting the development of production. Now this work section has changed from a backward work section to a high-yield red flag unit in the entire mine.

### 劳动、办公、开会、解决问题样样深入现场  两阳煤矿干部实现“四到煤窿”

    劳动、办公、开会、解决问题样样深入现场
    两阳煤矿干部实现“四到煤窿”
    新华社广州23日电　广东省两阳煤矿全体干部实行四到煤窿（即劳动到煤窿、办公到煤窿、会议到煤窿、解决问题到煤窿），真正做到既参加生产，又领导生产，既是指挥员、宣传员，又是战斗员。一个多月来，许多生产上的关键问题都在生产现场解决，不少会议也在生产现场召开，使得问题解决得又快又好，有效地促进生产的发展。
    两阳煤矿实行干部四到煤窿的措施，是从今年5月份开始的。他们由于实行了分工包干、抓重点、抓深、抓到底的作法，已使干部作风起了根本的变化。全体干部以煤窿为家，每天都有三分之二左右的时间参加生产，领导生产。一个多月来，很多生产上的关键问题都在生产第一线上及时解决。例如5月上旬崆峒工区下了大雨，占全矿产量三分之一的五号煤窿被雨水淹浸，这个矿的工区总支部书记敖景仁便在这关键时刻中带头投入堵截水汶的战斗，他一连十三昼夜没有离开窿口，在窿口召开了三次有技术员、工人、干部参加的三结合会议，经过两次失败，最后接受了工人提出开沟排水，用混凝土堵塞水汶的建议，终于征服了水患，使煤窿提前正常出煤。
    干部“四到煤窿”以后，很多有关生产问题的会议直接在生产现场召开，不但缩短了会议时间，而且解决问题又快又好。副矿长兼党委办公室主任林致德，摆脱了办公室的行政事务，深入到四号煤窿以后，发现煤线突然变化，如果继续打平坑，就要掘进七、八米的顷岩，要六、七天才能出煤。他在现场召开了工区主任、工段及工班干部会议，经过分析决定在平坑打斜井，结果，当天就继续出煤。这个会议前后只开了五分钟就解决了问题。工人反映：如果不是领导干部在现场具体研究，把问题拿到办公室去，两天也未必解决得好。
    干部直接参加劳动，同工人接触的时间更多了，不少领导干部和工人交上了知心朋友，出现了领导关心工人，工人爱护领导的新气象。两阳煤矿副矿长刘文元深入到大金星工段后，发现工地离食堂很远，马上发动干部和炊事员送饭到工地，使工人减少了吃饭往返跑路的时间，更好地休息。刘文元处处关心工人生活，成为工人的知心朋友，工人有什么事情都向他反映，使得问题很快发现又迅速获得解决，大大地促进了生产的发展。现在这个工段已由后进的工段一变而为全矿的高产红旗单位。
