    From Illiterate to Screenwriter
    Chen Guizhen

    I am an amateur art and literature enthusiast. To be able to attend this Literary and Art Congress and meet our greatest and most beloved leader Chairman Mao and the central leading comrades is the greatest honor of my life. This honor is bestowed upon me by the Party and the people.

    I grew from an illiterate housewife, after liberation participating in social work, gradually growing into a small soldier in the art and literature ranks. This is enough to show that people living in our socialist country can change from foolish to clever, from having no culture to becoming masters of culture. Some comrades asked me: Which school did you graduate from? I proudly answered him: I am studying in the university of society, and I haven't graduated yet. The fact is that our society is a communist university that cultivates people.

    Before, I had never even heard of the term "literature and art." After liberation, I participated in mass organizations such as the Women's Federation. In addition to directly receiving the Party's education, I was also inspired by films, dramas, and other literature and art. Literature and art enriched my revolutionary knowledge and increased my confidence and strength in the revolutionary cause. I love literature and art, from participating in amateur performances to amateur creation. Nine years have passed, and in these years, I have written thirteen or fourteen scripts. In addition to being performed by the amateur theater troupe in my unit, nine were published in Heilongjiang publications, "Little Scripts," and internal publications. My second script, "Family Affairs," also won an award in the National Drama Festival at that time. All of this is the result of the Party's painstaking cultivation.

    The script "Family Affairs" discusses that household chores should not be solely borne by women, and husbands should also share them. The conflict in the play is resolved in this way. This was the most appropriate solution in the reality of the time. Now, urban people's communes are being established on a large scale across the country, and household chores have been resolved more rationally and thoroughly. However, due to insufficient study at the time, I could not see so far ahead. In fact, Comrade Lenin taught us as early as 1919 in his article "On the Tasks of the Women Workers' Movement in the Soviet Republic": "We are establishing model institutions such as canteens and nurseries to help women get rid of housework."

  When my first script was performed in the enterprise system's festival, the Party gave me encouragement and also pointed out the shortcomings: the script had the problem of being formulaic and conceptual. When my second script, "Family Affairs," was published in a Heilongjiang provincial publication, the editor said, "This script has a strong atmosphere of life, and the advantage is that it does not have the problem of being formulaic and conceptual." I carefully pondered this and found a way to overcome formulaic and conceptual problems. For a long time, my works had many spelling mistakes, incorrect punctuation, and some sentences were unreadable. I myself did not understand writing common sense and had no artistic cultivation. It was only because I lived among the masses that I had rich themes and materials. In order to cooperate with the Party's central work and the production movement of my unit, I compiled these materials into scripts, and only with the help of the Party and comrades did I get the opportunity to perform and publish them. The Party often let me participate in relevant meetings, invited veteran writers and comrades with creative abilities to help me concretely, and invited comrades from all aspects to discuss the scripts. Through these, I went from not understanding to understanding, and gradually improved in practice. My growth is also the result of vigorously developing mass art and literature activities under the guidance of the Party's art and literature policy.

    This time, attending the National Literary and Art Congress and listening to the report of the central responsible comrades has greatly improved my thinking, clarified the Party's art and literature path, and at the same time deeply realized that the task of revolutionary art and literature workers is glorious and arduous. The work I have done in the past is still far from the Party's requirements for me. In the future, I must study Chairman Mao's works hard, improve my political awareness and artistic level, and do a better job in art and literature for the socialist cause.

    从目不识丁到写剧本
    陈桂珍
    我是一个业余文艺爱好者，能出席这次文代会，并见到我们最伟大、最敬爱的领袖毛主席和中央各领导同志，这是我一生中最大的光荣。这光荣是党，是人民赐给的。
    我由一个目不识丁的家庭妇女，解放后参加了社会工作，逐步成长为文艺队伍中的一个小兵，这足以说明生活在我们社会主义国家的人，是会由愚蠢变聪明，由无文化变成为文化的主人的。有的同志问我：你是什么学校毕业呀？我很骄傲地回答他：我正在社会大学学习，还没毕业。事实就是这样，我们的社会就是培养人的一个共产主义大学堂。
    以前我连文学艺术这名词都没听说过。解放后参加了妇联等群众组织，除了直接受到党的教育外，就是从电影、戏剧等文学艺术中受到启发。文学艺术使我丰富好多革命知识，也增加了我对革命事业的信心和力量。我爱好文艺，由参加业余演出，到业余创作。时间过了九年，在这几年里，我写了十三、四个剧本。除了在本单位业余剧团演出外，在黑龙江的刊物和《小剧本》以及内部刊物上发表了九个。第二个剧本《家务事》在当时全国话剧会演中还获得了奖励。所有这些都是党苦心培养的结果。
    《家务事》这个剧本谈的是家务事不应仅仅由妇女负担，丈夫也应分担，剧中的矛盾就是这样解决的。这在当时的现实中也只有这样解决比较合适。现在全国各地已大办城市人民公社，家务事已经得到更合理、更彻底的解决。可是我当时由于学习不够，没有能看得这么远。其实列宁同志在1919年《论苏维埃共和国女工运动的任务》一文中老早就教导我们：“我们正在创办食堂、托儿所这样一些示范性的机关，来帮助妇女摆脱家务。”
  当我第一个剧本在企业系统会演的时候，党给我鼓励的同时，也给我指出了缺点：剧本存在公式化和概念化的毛病。第二个剧本《家务事》在我们黑龙江省的刊物上发表时，编辑同志说，“这个剧本生活气息很浓厚，好处是没有公式化和概念化的毛病。”我细细琢磨，找到了克服公式化和概念化的道路。很长一个时期我的作品错白字很多，标点符号不正确，读起来有的不成句。我自己也不懂写作常识，没有文艺修养。只是我生活在群众中，才有丰富的题材和素材。为了配合党的中心工作和本单位生产运动，我把这些素材编成剧本，经过党和同志们的帮助才得到演出和发表的机会，党经常让我参加有关的会议，请老作家和有创作能力的同志具体帮助我，请各方面的同志讨论剧本。通过这些使我由不懂到懂，在实践中逐步提高起来。我的成长也正是在党的文艺方针政策指导下，大搞群众文艺活动的结果。
    我这次出席文代大会，听到中央负责同志的报告，使我在思想上又提高了很多，明确了党的文艺道路，同时也深深体会到，革命文艺工作者的任务是光荣和艰巨的。自己从前做的工作，按党对我的要求还差得很远，我今后一定要努力学习毛主席著作，提高政治觉悟和艺术水平，为社会主义事业，把文艺工作做得更好。
