　　Huaihai Machinery Plant Fully Supports Agriculture
　　Adopts Ten Measures to Help Sixty Communes Transform Agricultural Technology
　　(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 16th) The Huaihai Machinery Plant in Shanxi has firmly established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. Under the slogan of "Everyone does one or several good deeds to support agriculture, and everyone contributes to the technical transformation of agriculture," since 1958, it has proactively helped rural areas repair agricultural tools, develop agricultural machinery manufacturing, and help counties and communes establish factories and enterprises. It has made remarkable achievements in supporting agriculture and has become a red flag in the Taihang Mountains for supporting agriculture.
　　Currently, the Huaihai Machinery Plant has implemented factory-commune ties with sixty people's communes in twelve counties in Jinzhong, Jin southeast, Jinbei, and Jinnan Special Zones. From January to June of this year alone, the mechanical equipment provided by the factory to support agriculture included: thirty-eight shaping machines, one heavy eight-foot lathe, one "1616" lathe, twenty-seven electric motors ranging from 1 to 4.5 kilowatts, one 30-horsepower generator, nine hundred and thirty-seven gate valves, one hundred and eighteen 10-horsepower boiler-trolley engines, and one hundred and fifty Taigu-brand wheat harvesters. It also provided various raw materials, including steel, electric wire, rails, pig iron, various water pipes, machine parts, and bearings. During the same period, the factory dispatched a technical advisory group and an anti-drought machinery repair team consisting of fifty-five technicians and workers to go deep into the rural areas, where they taught more than 500 farmers techniques for using and repairing machines. They also repaired 357 various drainage and irrigation and power machinery for the rural areas and helped reform a large number of tools. During the wheat harvest, the entire factory organized 1,500 employees to help nearby eight management districts rush to harvest more than 240 mu of wheat.
　　The Huaihai Machinery Plant began its vigorous support for agriculture in 1958. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party committee secretary, a mass movement to support agriculture was launched, creating ten effective methods for supporting agriculture:
　　(1) According to national plans and rural needs, various machines were trial-produced and produced to support agriculture and local industry. In the past two years, more than 1,200 sets of modern agricultural drainage and irrigation equipment and power station equipment such as boiler-trolley engines, water pumps, steam turbines, and generators have been produced.
　　(2) Under the premise of ensuring the completion of national plans, the masses were mobilized to tap the production potential of enterprises and increase the production of machine tools, simple lathes, bench drills, shaping machines, and other equipment to directly equip county-run industry and commune industry.
　　(3) Without affecting factory production, a portion of surplus, temporarily unused, or discarded equipment, tools, and materials were excavated from warehouses in the form of "giving, borrowing, and selling," repaired, assembled, and refurbished to support commune industry. This included 132 machine tools, more than 10,000 tools, 118 types of metal materials, totaling more than 80 tons.
　　(4) Taking full responsibility for commune-run industries, seeing them through to the end. In the past two years, fourteen county-run factories and fifty-one commune-run factories have been equipped and semi-equipped. From design to construction, from equipment to installation, from training technical personnel to putting them into production, the method of taking full responsibility was basically adopted.
　　(5) Organizing technicians to go to the countryside and repair machines such as generators, diesel engines, boiler-trolley engines, and gas engines for the communes.
　　(6) Through allocation, training, and other methods, solving the problem of the shortage of personnel in commune industries and the use of agricultural machinery. In the past two years, more than 50 cadres, managers, technicians, and workers have been transferred to county and commune industries, and 998 various technicians have been trained.
　　(7) Grasping the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production, organizing workers to participate in labor in the communes during their spare time and holidays.
　　(8) Fixing targets and establishing factory-commune ties. The form of factories contracting communes and workshops contracting management areas was implemented. Both sides took the initiative to connect, understand each other, and put the activities to support agriculture on a track with goals, plans, and organizations.
　　(9) Educating employees to take the opportunity of returning home to do some good deeds for the countryside. Employees who returned home for the New Year, festivals, family visits, or weddings all took time to help the commune work, repair machines, and impart technology.
　　(10) Organizing employees to carry out amateur labor and support the newly built local industry free of charge.
　　The Huaihai Machinery Plant's support for agricultural technology transformation in the past two years has achieved great results, increased rural productivity, and promoted the transformation of poor communes into rich communes. For example, the Yuejin Machinery Plant, built with the help of Yaozhuang Commune in Lin County, now has nearly 300 people and an annual output value of 3 million yuan. It has produced lathes, gas engines, carts, flatbed trucks, electric motors, native rails, and other small agricultural machines. It is now preparing to produce generators and harvesters, which have already played a huge role in the technical transformation of agriculture.
　　In order to better support agriculture in the future, the Huaihai Machinery Plant has recently jointly established a committee for supporting agricultural technology transformation with the linked counties and communes, established a regular contact system, and helped the linked units formulate industrial development plans. Currently, the mass movement to support agriculture in the Huaihai Machinery Plant has seen a new upsurge.

　　淮海机械厂全面支援农业
　　采取十项办法帮助六十个公社改造农业技术
    本报太原16日电　山西淮海机械厂巩固树立以农业为基础的思想，在“人人为支援农业办一件或几件好事，个个为支援农业技术改造出力”的口号下，从1958年以来，由主动帮助农村修理农具，发展到帮助农村制造农业机械，和帮助县、社建立工厂企业，在支援农业中做出了显著成绩，成为太行山支援农业的一面红旗。
    现在，淮海机械厂已经和晋中、晋东南、晋北、晋南等专区十二个县的六十个人民公社实行了厂社挂钩。仅今年1至6月，这个厂支援农业的机械设备就有：牛头刨床三十八台，重八尺车床一台，“一六一六”车床一台，一至四点五瓩的电动机二十七台，三十马力发电机一台，闸阀门九百三十七个，十马力的锅驼机一百一十八台，太谷号小麦收割机一百五十台；支援各种原材料有钢材、电线、道轨、生铁、各种水管、机器配件、轴承等。同一时期，这个厂派出了由五十五名技术工人组成的支援农业技术顾问团和抗旱机械修理大队，深入农村，向五百多农民传授了机器的使用、检修等技术，并为农村修好各种排灌和动力机械三百五十七台，帮助改革了大批工具。麦收期间，全厂并组织了一千五百名职工帮助附近八个管理区抢收小麦二百四十多亩。
    淮海机械厂从1958年就开始了大力支援农业的活动。两年来，在党委书记挂帅，大搞支援农业的群众运动中，创造了支援农业的十项有效方法。
      （1）根据国家计划和农村需要，试制和生产了各种机械支援农业和地方工业。两年来共生产了锅驼机、水泵、汽轮机、发电机等现代农业排灌设备和电站设备一千二百多台。
      （2）在保证完成国家计划的前提下，发动群众挖掘企业生产潜力，增产机床、简易元车、台钻、牛头刨等直接武装县营工业和公社工业。
    （3）在不影响工厂生产的条件下，通过“送、借、卖”的形式，把一部分多余的，暂时不用的，或废旧的设备工具、材料，从库房中挖掘出来，加以修理配套复新，支援公社工业。计有机床一百三十二台，工具一万余件，金属材料一百一十八种，共八十余吨。
    （4）对社办工业包起来，一竿子插到底。两年来先后武装和半武装了十四个县营工厂和五十一个社办工厂。从设计到建筑，从设备到安装，从培养技术人材到投入生产，基本上采取包起来办到底的方法。
    （5）组织技术工人下乡和给公社修理发电机、柴油机、锅驼机、煤气机等机械。
    （6）通过调拨、培训等方法，解决公社工业与使用农业机器所缺的人材问题。二年中，调给县和公社工业干部、管理人员、技术人员和工人五十余名，培训各种技术工人九百九十八名。
    （7）抓住农业生产的季节特点，组织工人利用业余时间和假日到公社参加劳动。
    （8）固定对象，厂社挂钩。实行了厂包社，车间包管理区的形式。双方主动挂钩，互相了解，使支援农业的活动，走上了有目标、有计划、有组织的轨道。
    （9）教育职工利用回乡的机会，为农村做几件好事。回乡过年过节、探亲、结婚的职工，大都抽空帮助公社干活，修理机器，传授技术。
    （10）组织职工进行业余劳动，无偿地支援地方新建工业。
    淮海机械厂两年来支援农业技术改造，获得了巨大效果，增加了农村生产力，促进了穷社变富社。如帮助林县姚庄公社建起的跃进机械厂，现在有近三百人，年产值三百万元。已生产出了元车煤气机、马车、平车、电动机、土铁轨和其它小型农业机器。近来准备生产发电机和收割机，对农业技术改造已经发挥出巨大的作用。
    淮海机械厂为了今后更好地支援农业，最近又和挂钩的县社联合成立了支援农业技术改造委员会，建立了定期的联系制度，并且帮助挂钩的单位制订了工业发展规划。现在，淮海机械厂支援农业的群众运动已出现了新的高潮。
