Xinhua News Agency, July 5th, Tunis: The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic issued a government communiqué on the 4th, exposing the French government's attempt to force the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic to surrender and stating that under the current conditions that France is attempting to impose, it is inappropriate for the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic to send a delegation to France for negotiations.

The communiqué stated that the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, based on the report submitted by its envoys regarding the preliminary meeting held in Melun (France) from June 25th to 29th, studied the situation on July 2nd and 3rd. The communiqué stated, "Our envoys found themselves facing conditions stipulated by the French government, which intends to unilaterally prescribe the conditions for meetings between the Algerian delegation and the French delegation."

The communiqué pointed out, "The French government rejected all our suggestions, even the most conciliatory ones." "It even ruled out the possibility of any discussion or modification of these conditions through agreements between the two delegations during the negotiation process; these conditions would remain unchangeable." "Under these conditions, the Algerian delegation would be deprived of all the freedom befitting the dignity and status of negotiation representatives."

The communiqué then cited the following conditions:

	"For example, the delegation is not allowed to contact anyone in any form, either within France or abroad, except for contact with Tunisia. The delegation is not allowed to receive visitors. It is also specifically stipulated that our delegation cannot directly, indirectly via telephone, or through the intermediary of other advisors, contact any Algerian ministers currently confined in prisons or detained in fortresses."

The communiqué pointed out, "Therefore, the members of the negotiation delegation, after accepting General de Gaulle's invitation, will have less freedom in France than a political prisoner." The communiqué stated, "This attitude of the French government reflects a state of mind that in fact amounts to a rejection of negotiations." The communiqué pointed out that the interpretation of General de Gaulle's recent statements in Melun "seems to be attempting to force us to surrender using new wording."

The communiqué stated, "Finally, to add to the obstacles, the French government found it necessary to specify that the Algerian delegation's arrival in France is conditional upon our acceptance of all the conditions unilaterally proposed by the (French) government."

The communiqué stated that the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic wishes to preserve all opportunities for a negotiated solution, "However, under the current circumstances and conditions, it is inappropriate for the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic to go to France. It is currently impossible for it to contribute to the resolution of the problem."

The communiqué expressed that the conditions and manner of such a meeting must not be imposed, but must be carefully considered and agreed upon by both parties. "If the French government is willing to consider this basic principle, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic will be prepared to send its envoys to France again."

### 阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府发表公报  阿法谈判不能在法国强加的条件下举行

    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府发表公报
    阿法谈判不能在法国强加的条件下举行
    揭露法国竟要无理剥夺阿尔及利亚代表团的自由并图迫使阿尔及利亚投降指出阿尔及利亚政府愿意保持谈判机会但目前暂时不派代表团去法国谈判
    新华社5日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府4日发表一项政府公报，揭露法国政府企图使阿尔及利亚临时政府投降，并且认为在目前法国企图强加的条件下，阿尔及利亚临时政府派代表团去法国谈判是不合时宜的。
    公报说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府根据它的使节就6月25日到29日在（法国）默伦举行的预备会议提出的报告，于7月2日和3日研究了局势。公报说，“我们的使节发现自己面临着法国政府规定的条件，法国政府打算单方面规定阿尔及利亚代表团和法国代表团之间会议的条件。”
    公报指出，“法国政府拒绝了我们所有的建议，那怕是最和解性的建议”。“它甚至排除了这种可能性：通过双方代表团在谈判过程中的协议，对这些条件进行任何讨论或作任何修改，这些条件将一直是不可改变的”。“根据这些条件，阿尔及利亚代表团将被剥夺同谈判代表的尊严和地位相称的一切自由。”
    公报接着举出这样一些条件：
  “例如，代表团不准在法国国内或对法国国外以任何形式同任何人接触，只有同突尼斯的联系除外。代表团不得接见访问的人。还具体规定，我们的代表团不能直接地，或是用电话间接地，或是通过其他顾问的媒介，同目前被禁闭在监狱中或是被拘禁在堡垒中的任何阿尔及利亚部长接触。”
    公报指出，“因此，进行谈判的代表团团员们在接受戴高乐将军的邀请后，在法国的自由比一个政治犯的自由还要少得多。”公报说，“法国政府的这种态度反映了一种心理状态，这种心理状态事实上就是拒绝谈判。”公报指出，在默伦对戴高乐将军最近的声明所作的解释，“看来是在用新的措词企图使我们投降”。
    公报说，“最后，为了增加障碍，法国政府觉得有必要具体说明，阿尔及利亚代表团抵达法国以我们接受（法国）政府单方面提出的一切条件为必要条件。”
    公报说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府希望保持谈判解决的一切机会，“但是，在目前情况和条件下，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团去法国是不合时宜的。目前它不可能有助于问题的解决。”
    公报表示，这种会议的条件和方式必须不是为人所强加，而是由双方仔细考虑取得协议。“如果法国政府愿考虑这个基本原则，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府将准备再派它的使节到法国去。”
