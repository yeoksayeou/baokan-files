Southern Fury
    Yuan Ying
If you go to the North, please tell Chairman Ho: On this land, there can only be one flag!
        --Vietnamese Southern folk song

A storm blows from the Western Pacific, across the 17th parallel, across the blue sea, across the plains and mountains, to the fertile Mekong Delta and the enchanting Plain of Reeds! Let the storm rise in the South, sending the heartache of loved ones like knife cuts to the North, sending full-throated anger. It ignites the fire of fury in the hearts of the fathers and elders of the South, burning toward the enemy, burning toward the American-Diem clique! The South, ah, is an indivisible territory under one sky, not to become an American military camp, not to let the Stars and Stripes fly arrogantly. Saigon, ah, heroic Ho Chi Minh City, the home of so many Vietnamese people, cannot be humiliated, cannot be allowed to be stirred up by American tanks raising dust to the sky. The Central Highlands and the Plain of Reeds, ah, are the homeland of the resistance, nurturing countless heroic sons and daughters, how can it allow American boots to trample, as if treading on a mother's breast. In the places ravaged by the American devils, in the places where the traitorous bandits slaughter, the Southern people, ah, raise the swords and guns they used to fight the colonialists, raise the torch of revenge. Get out, American devils, Vietnam is the homeland of the Vietnamese people, from Lang Son to Ca Mau Cape, it is one territory, one heart, you are not allowed to divide it in two, you are not allowed to run rampant! Stop, executioner Ngo Dinh Diem, you are not allowed to turn the South into a sinful bet, you are not allowed to kill people madly! More than ten million Southern people, more than ten million volcanoes. Volcanoes, in the storm, spew out flames that reach the sky, to burn the Southern sky red, to boil the waves of the South China Sea, to burn the enemy into ashes in one breath. The fury of the South, ah, burns fiercely, fiercely. Burn down the American devils' tanks, smash the black shackles! Let Highway One run smoothly; let the banks of the Perfume River overflow with laughter; let the farmers of the Ca Mau Peninsula plant the superior rice seeds of the Red River; let the fishermen of Con Lon Island see the pictorials published in Hanoi; let the young workers of Cho Lon, let the girls of My Tho and Can Tho, come to the capital to greet Uncle Ho. Let those more than ten million brothers and sisters, under the glorious banner of Uncle Ho, walk together with the Northern people on the bright road of socialism!

    南方的怒火
    袁鹰你要是到北方去，请你告诉胡主席：在这块土地上面，只能有一面国旗！
        ——越南南方歌谣风暴从西太平洋吹来，吹过十七度线，吹过蓝天下的大海，吹过平原和山地，吹到富饶的湄公河三角洲和令人神往的同塔梅盆地去吧！风暴在南方吹起，向北方送去亲人的刀割似的心疼，送去满腔的愤怒。燃起了南方父老心头的怒火，烧向敌人烧向美吴集团！南方啊，是一个天空下不可分割的国土，不能成为美国兵营，不能让星条旗狂妄地飞舞。西贡啊，英雄的胡志明城，多少个越南人的故居，不能让她受凌辱，被美国战车扬起冲天尘土。西原和同塔梅啊，是抗战的故乡，养育了多少英雄儿女，那能容美国皮靴践踏，就像踏着母亲的胸脯。在美国佬蹂躏的地方，在卖国贼屠杀的场所，南方人啊，举起了当年打殖民者的刀枪，举起了复仇的火炬。滚回去，美国佬，越南是越南人的祖国，从谅山到金瓯角，是一个国土，一条心，不许你们分成两半，不许你们猖狂横行！住手，刽子手吴庭艳，不许你把南方变成罪恶的赌注，不许你疯狂地杀人！一千多万南方人，一千多万座火山。火山，在风暴里喷出连天烈火，要把南方的天烧红，要把南海的波浪烧滚，要把敌人一气烧成灰烬。南方的怒火啊，猛烈地、猛烈地燃烧。烧毁美国佬的战车，砸碎那黑色的镣铐！让第一号公路畅行无阻；让香江两岸洋溢着欢笑；让金瓯半岛的农民，栽下红河的优种稻；让昆仑岛上的渔夫，看到河内出版的画报；让西堤的青年工人，让美萩、芹苴的姑娘，到首都来向胡伯伯问好。让那一千多万兄弟姐妹，在胡伯伯的光辉旗帜下，同北方人一起走上社会主义的
  光明大道！
