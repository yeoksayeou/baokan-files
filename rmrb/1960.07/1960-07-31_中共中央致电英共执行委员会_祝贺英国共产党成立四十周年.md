Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, congratulating the Communist Party of Great Britain on its 40th anniversary. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

To the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain,

Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Great Britain, The CPC Central Committee, on behalf of all members of our Party and the entire Chinese people, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to the Communist Party of Great Britain, and through you, to the British working class.

For the past forty years, the Communist Party of Great Britain has unremittingly fought for the interests and revolutionary cause of the British working class and laboring people, and has made significant contributions to the cause of the international proletariat.

The development of the current international situation is increasingly favorable to our cause of striving for peace and socialism. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day, the national democratic movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries are surging forward, the struggles of the working class and laboring people in capitalist countries are also vigorously developing, and the forces of oppressed nations and people around the world opposing imperialism and defending peace are growing stronger and stronger. The imperialist countries headed by U.S. imperialism are suffering defeats everywhere in their policies of aggression and war. Imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated. As long as the people of the world unite and persist in struggle, they will surely win the victory of world peace and socialism.

We firmly believe that the Communist Party of Great Britain, with its forty years of glorious history, will be able to unite the British working class and the peace-loving people of Britain more closely, and make greater contributions to the sacred cause of defending the vital interests of the British working class, defending world peace, and striving for the realization of socialism. We wish you even greater achievements in your struggles.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中共中央致电英共执行委员会
    祝贺英国共产党成立四十周年
    新华社30日讯　中国共产党中央委员会打电报给英国共产党执行委员会，祝贺英国共产党成立四十周年。贺电全文如下：英国共产党执行委员会亲爱的同志们：
    值此英国共产党成立四十周年之际，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表我党全体党员和全体中国人民，向英国共产党，并通过你们向英国工人阶级，致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，英国共产党坚持不懈地为英国工人阶级和劳动人民的利益和革命事业而奋斗，并且对国际无产阶级的事业作出了重大的贡献。
    目前国际形势的发展越来越有利于我们争取和平和社会主义的事业。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主运动正在高涨，资本主义各国工人阶级和劳动人民的斗争也在蓬勃地发展，全世界被压迫民族和人民反对帝国主义和保卫和平的力量越来越强大了。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家的侵略政策和战争政策到处遭到失败。帝国主义越来越孤立了。只要全世界人民团结起来，坚持斗争，就一定能够赢得世界和平和社会主义的胜利。
    我们深信，有了四十年光荣历史的英国共产党，必能更加密切地团结英国工人阶级和英国爱好和平的人民，在保卫英国工人阶级的切身利益、保卫世界和平和为实现社会主义而奋斗的神圣事业中，作出更大的贡献。祝你们在斗争中取得更伟大的成就。
            中国共产党中央委员会
                  1960年7月28日
