    Contemporary Hero
    Zhang Bingxian, the leader of the Leap Forward Shock Brigade of the First Engineering Division of the Qinghai Provincial First Construction Company and a Communist Party member, is an outstanding construction worker with eleven years of accident-free work, four years of high-quality and high-yield production, and consistent over-fulfillment of production tasks every month of every year. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, he created many advanced construction machines, including a bricklaying standardizer, which broke through the technical barrier of building tall chimneys. He first promoted advanced experiences such as the "four-four bricklaying method" in his team, making the masonry project a complete set, increasing efficiency six times. This is him (front) using the "four-four bricklaying method" and a joint mortar spreading device for rapid construction.
