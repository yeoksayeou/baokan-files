To raise pigs, focus on feed. Everyone knows that more feed means more pigs. Now is a great opportunity to develop feed production. Party committees at all levels and rural people's communes are further strengthening their leadership over the pig-raising industry, and a new nationwide upsurge in pig-raising is about to arrive. We must seize the time and make various preparations to meet the new high tide of pig raising. The most important of these is to produce and store more coarse and refined feed.

Summer is the peak season for feed production. Vegetation is lush, and wild feed is everywhere. The roots, stems, leaves, and peels of many crops can be used as feed. Various agricultural and sideline product residues after comprehensive utilization are mostly good pig feed. The feed planted in feed bases in various places will also be harvested successively. All kinds of favorable conditions indicate that now is a good time to collect, make, store, and plant feed in a big way. Seizing this favorable opportunity and taking various measures to produce feed can not only meet the current needs of a large number of grown pigs and piglets, but more importantly, it can store a portion of feed to prepare for the off-season needs. This can change the situation in some areas where feed supply is intermittent, and achieve planned feed arrangements to ensure year-round supply.

To solve the feed problem, we must make comprehensive plans, plan production, and plan supply. Pigs are gluttonous animals and need a lot of feed. A pig from weaning to maturity, calculated over ten months, eats forty to fifty dan of refined and coarse feed. Now, the pig farms operated by communes, production teams, and canteens, ranging from dozens to hundreds, thousands, or even thousands of heads, require a large amount of feed every day. The experience of many places has repeatedly proven that the more and better feed a region stores, the more pig heads will increase linearly, and the higher the breeding rate of sows and the survival rate of piglets. Bobai County in Guangxi is a typical example. In the first half of last year, the county did not focus on feed production, and the number of pigs once declined. Later, the county party committee made a firm decision to focus on feed, proposing to grasp feed first to raise pigs, and to grasp feed like grasping people's rations. The county's feed production was comprehensively arranged, with planned supply, planting every month, harvesting every day, and frequent storage. Therefore, the number of pigs in stock increased by 124% compared with the same period last year and by 40.6% compared with the end of last year; the survival rate of piglets reached 98.7%. It is very clear that whether pig production can stably increase at a high speed, the decisive link is that the leadership must truly focus on feed work and ensure an adequate supply of feed at all times. How much feed is needed for more pigs? The leading organs must have a clear idea and calculate the required feed account based on the number and size of pigs and the development plan for the year. Then mobilize the masses, and at the same time organize specialized feed production teams, to plant and collect in a planned and phased manner to ensure a year-round supply of feed.

When arranging pig feed, we should focus on green and coarse feed and appropriately match refined feed. This can make full use of various wild feeds and agricultural and forestry by-products, save a large amount of grain, and greatly reduce pig-raising costs. This is not a temporary expedient, but a reasonable, scientific, and long-term policy. China has a mild climate, with many mountains and rivers, and all kinds of aquatic and terrestrial wild feeds are inexhaustible. We must be good at seizing favorable opportunities, widely mobilizing the masses, establishing the ambition to obtain feed from nature, relying on mountains to eat mountains, and relying on water to eat water, and immediately launch a movement to collect and store green and coarse feed in a big way.

The by-products of summer harvest crops—wheat husks and stalks, rapeseed, broad bean, and pea stems and leaves—are all good pig feed, and all localities should make serious use of them. In the past, many areas lacked the habit of using summer harvest crop by-products as feed. Wheat bran, rapeseed husks, bean stalks, etc., were often burned as ash for fertilizer, and wheat stalks, rapeseed stalks, etc., were often used as fuel. This is a great waste. Using these by-products as pig feed can not only feed pigs but also produce more and better-quality fertilizer. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

Managing existing feed land and making full use of all vacant land and water surfaces to plant various high-yield feeds is also a powerful measure to solve the feed problem. Cultivating aquatic feed should be greatly promoted. After the large-scale water conservancy movement, the water surface in China has increased a lot. The north, which has always been relatively dry, has also seen many reservoirs, which can develop various aquatic feeds. In promoting aquatic feed, special attention should be paid to the breeding of chlorella. Chlorella has high nutritional value, is easy to breed, and is an ideal refined feed.

To feed pigs well, a certain amount of refined feed is also needed. The grain produced on dedicated feed land and the comprehensively utilized agricultural and sideline products are all refined feed. In addition, a portion of feed grain should be reserved based on the principle of overall consideration of rations, seeds, feed, and reserve grain. A system of "dedicated grain for dedicated use, dedicated storage, indicators assigned to farms, and monthly payments" must be established to ensure that feed grain is not diverted to other uses.

China has a very rich variety of feed sources, and there are many experiences in various places in solving the feed problem. Party committees at all levels are determined to grasp firmly, practically, and continuously, and feed production will surely develop greatly. The secretary of the Ganxiang Commune Party Committee in Jinshan County, Shanghai, personally took action and launched a mass movement. In just five days, all the water surfaces and vacant land that could be planted with feed were planted with feed, and 100,000 dan of green and coarse feed were collected. Chlorella and streptomycete mycelium feed bases were also established. We should follow their example, fully mobilize the masses, and implement planting, collection, and processing simultaneously to prepare sufficient feed for the continued leap forward in pig production this year.

### 抓养猪就要抓饲料

    抓养猪就要抓饲料
    抓养猪就要抓饲料，有了更多的饲料才能养更多的猪，这个道理是大家都很清楚的。当前正是发展饲料生产的大好时机，各级党委和各地农村人民公社正在进一步加强对养猪业的领导，一个全国范围的养猪新高潮就要到来。我们要抓紧时间，做好迎接养猪新高潮的各种准备工作，其中最主要的工作，就是生产、储备更多的粗精饲料。
    夏季是饲料生产的旺季。草木繁茂，到处都有野生饲料；可作饲料的农作物的根茎叶皮很多；综合利用以后的各种农副产品的剩余物，大都是很好的猪饲料；各地饲料基地种植的饲料，也要陆续收获了。种种有利的条件，都说明了目前正是大采、大制、大储、大种饲料的好时候。抓紧这个有利时机，采取各种措施生产饲料，一方面能供应大批成猪和仔猪当前的需要，更重要的是可以贮存一部分饲料，为淡季的需要作好准备。这就可以改变某些地区饲料供应的青黄不接状态，作到饲料的计划安排、保证全年供应。
    解决饲料问题，必须全面规划，计划生产，计划供应。猪是一种贪食动物，需要饲料很多。一头猪从断奶到长成，以十个月计算，要吃精粗饲料四、五十担。现在公社、生产队、食堂经营的猪场，小则几十头，大则几百头、上千头以至几千头，每天需要大量饲料。许多地方的经验一再证明：哪个地区贮备的饲料多、好，哪个地区的生猪头数就能直线上升，母猪的繁殖率和仔猪的成活率就高。广西博白县就是一个典型例子。去年上半年，这个县没有抓紧饲料生产，生猪头数一度下降。后来县委下了决心，狠抓饲料，提出抓养猪先抓饲料，要像抓人的口粮一样地抓饲料的口号。全县饲料生产全面安排，计划供应，月月有种，天天有收，经常有贮备。因此，存栏猪比去年同期增长了124％，比去年年底增长了40.6％；仔猪成活率达到98.7％。事情十分清楚，生猪生产能不能高速度地稳定上升，决定性的一环是领导上要真正抓紧饲料工作，保证在任何时候都有充足的饲料供应。猪多了，究竟需要多少饲料，领导机关要心中有底，根据生猪的数量、大小和当年的发展计划，算出所需要的饲料账。然后发动广大群众，同时组织饲料专业生产队，有计划地分期种植，分期采集，保证全年都有饲料供应。
    安排猪饲料的时候，应以青粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料。这样可以充分利用各种野生饲料和农业、林业的副产品，节省大批粮食，大大降低养猪成本。这不是临时的权宜之计，而是合理的、科学的长期的方针。我国气候温和，多山多水，各种水生陆生野生饲料，简直取之不尽，用之不竭。我们要善于抓住有利时机，广泛发动群众，树立向大自然索取饲料的雄心壮志，靠山吃山、靠水吃水，立即掀起一个大采大贮青粗饲料的运动。
    夏收作物的副产物——小麦的壳和秆，油菜、胡豆、豌豆的茎叶，都是很好的猪饲料，各地应该认真地加以利用。过去，许多地区缺乏利用夏收作物副产物做饲料的习惯。麦糠、油菜壳、豆秸等往往烧灰作肥料，麦秆、油菜秆等往往用做燃料，这是很大的浪费。把这些副产物用做猪饲料，既能喂猪，又能生产更多的质量更高的肥料，这不是一举两得的事情么？
    管好现有的饲料地，充分利用一切空闲地和水面种植各种各样的高产饲料，也是解决饲料问题的有力措施。培植水生饲料更要大大提倡。经过大兴水利运动，我国的水面增加很多。一向比较干旱的北方，也出现了许多水库，可以发展各种水生饲料。在推广水生饲料中，要特别注意繁殖小球藻。小球藻营养价值高，容易繁殖，是一种理想的精饲料。
    要想把猪喂好，还需要一定数量的精饲料。专用饲料地上生产的粮食，综合利用后的农副产品，都是精饲料，除此以外，还要根据口粮、种子、饲料、贮备粮统筹兼顾的原则，留出一部分饲料粮。要切实建立“专粮专用、专仓保管、指标到场、按月支付”的制度，饲料粮不应挪作他用。
    我国各种饲料来源十分丰富，各地解决饲料问题的经验也很多。各级党委下决心狠狠地抓，扎扎实实地抓，连续不断地抓，饲料生产就一定能够大大发展起来。上海市金山县干巷公社党委书记亲自动手，大搞群众运动，短短五天之内，就把能种饲料的水面和空地都种上了饲料，并收集了十万担青粗饲料，还建立了小球藻和链霉菌丝饲料基地。我们应该效法他们的榜样，充分发动群众，实行种植、采集和加工同时并举，为今年生猪生产的继续跃进备足充分的饲料。
