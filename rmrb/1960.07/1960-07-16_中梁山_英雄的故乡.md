Zhongliang Mountain – A Hometown of Heroes
　　Yan Yi
　　For people entering a city from the countryside for the first time, the network of countless streets, the shuttling cars and trams, often cause a dizzying effect. I felt the same way when I first arrived at the mine.

　　Battery-powered trains pull you into the depths of the mountain, making you feel as if you're inside the mountain's chest. Here, the station whistles sound, signal lights flash, and battery trains of various sizes come and go from every tunnel. Health workers and doctors, carrying red cross bags, open the doors of the chambers and head to each mining area. Repair stations, substations, rescue rooms, and charging rooms are all located in the chambers on both sides of the main tunnel. In the corridor-like rest areas, miners eat their health-sustaining meals and chat and laugh. It truly feels like the city center here, with countless tunnels extending from here to each coal-mining face. In the depths of each tunnel, drilling machines, pneumatic picks, and pneumatic hammers, loading machines, and electric chutes play their music. Countless stars—the miners' headlamps—glimmer and shine where the machines are working. Coal, the gleaming black gold, the grain of industry, rushes out of the mine car after car, heading for coking plants and steel mills.

　　Originally, I thought this was the entire mine, but it wasn't. When you leave the corridor, two huge iron doors open, welcoming you into a sealed room – the elevator. With a bell ringing, in the blink of an eye, you are lifted to the second level tunnel, the third level tunnel, the fourth level tunnel. Who knows how many levels there are! Each level is exactly the same as the first: battery trains of different sizes, tunnels extending in all directions. Cables, air supply pipes, exhaust vents, water pipes, coil around in every tunnel like long dragons. Wind blows, various machines play their music, and glittering headlamps are everywhere. One tunnel after another, it feels like walking into a maze. Coal, coal cars pulled from every tunnel, are sent by locomotives into circular, rotating houses – these circular machines automatically dump the coal into the coal chutes, and just like above, a string of trains is already waiting below. When filled, they rush forward with a shout.

　　The mine is truly like an underground city, but even more like a large foreign-style building, layer upon layer, from the ground up to the peak of the mountain, with the elevator connecting each level. However, this "building" is extremely, extremely large.

　　This is the modern Zhongliang Mountain Coal Mine, built at the start of our country's First Five-Year Plan and put into production one year ahead of schedule. Here, I saw many of the most advanced mechanical equipment. But, what is most exciting is the people armed with the most advanced ideology of modern times—Mao Zedong Thought!

　　There are many famous figures from all over the country, the province, the city, and the mine itself. Their photos hang in the city's cultural palace and the mine's Hall of Honor, attracting and inspiring the hearts of millions of people to make great ambitions to build the motherland. These famous figures, the heroes who create miracles, are fighting in every tunnel, working with the masses to fight for more coal, more steel for the motherland. There's Wang Zhizhong, who conquers nature and overcomes gas, Li Guanglin, who appears wherever there's difficulty or danger, Liao Guanghui, who is good at uniting and educating the masses and achieves a 90% recovery rate of pit props, and Zhong Wenfu, who boldly innovates technology and created multiple sets of automatic pneumatic drill supports. There are large groups that completed their annual production targets in five months and four days, and technological innovation heroes who use slag to make pit props and extract oil from sawdust. Their heroic deeds are impossible to write about completely. But when you ask them, they always answer with "It's nothing." Because in their great ambitions, they have even higher requirements, even bigger plans. Compared with the achievements already created and those to be created, they always seem very small to them.

　　In the mine director's office, you will often meet people who request to be assigned the most difficult tasks, even arguing with each other until their faces turn red.

　　When you meet them in the shift handover room, in the tunnels, in the elevator, in the rest areas, or on the trains heading back, the first thing they say to each other is "How is it going?"

　　"Completed!" or "Exceeded the quota again!" Doesn't this most ordinary greeting typically illustrate the sense of honor of being a miner?!

　　This is the miner's style: "Go to the most difficult place," "Completed," "Exceeded the quota."

　　Yes, it was they who completed this modern mine for the motherland one year ahead of schedule. In 1954, this place was still a barren mountain, still a wilderness ruled by tigers, leopards, and wild boars. They used their own hands to build this place into a coal city with bright lights, rows of foreign-style buildings, and cars and trains coming and going. In the Kuomintang era, bureaucrats relied on experts from American imperialism to open a coal mine here, but it was eventually closed due to high gas levels. But gas, the miner's fierce enemy, has now surrendered in the hands of today's miners, offering up its black gold.

　　"It's changed so fast!" This is the exclamation of everyone who has ever been to Zhongliang Mountain. Yes, under the leadership of the Party and guided by Mao Zedong's invincible thought, the miners completed it at a speed unimaginable to bourgeois experts. This is the victory of our Party's general line for building socialism, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　I remember a saying from the director of the Coal Management Bureau, "This place produces coal, but even more so, it produces heroes!" Yes, our construction speed is fast, and people are growing even faster.

　　Look, a miner who was illiterate in the old society is now the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of this modern coal mine; a demobilized soldier is now an expert in production management; a young man who worked as a child laborer in the old society is now a hero in taming gas. Liao Guanghui, a young farmer who came from the countryside in July 1958, is now the head of a coal mining area. And Li Guanglin, this young man who is just twenty-two years old, is also a soldier who was demobilized from the army in 1958. There are too many such figures to count, and they have all become the backbone of coal mining.

　　Zhongliang Mountain, ah Zhongliang Mountain, you are famous because of your heroic miners, and you have also trained heroic miners, enabling many ordinary farmers to grow into real miners after participating in industrial production. They came from all directions, turning you from a barren mountain into a coal city of the motherland. Your majestic, brightly lit figure is precisely the image of the miners! No wonder they sing, "Zhongliang Mountain is a good place… it is our beloved hometown!"

　　They recognize you as their hometown and are using a daring and capable communist style to build you even more beautifully. "What the world has, we must also have, what the world does not have, we will create, what the world dares not do, we will do!" This is the oath of the miners of Zhongliang Mountain!

　　Ah, even if I had a thousand hands, I could not finish writing about the heroic deeds here!

　　Zhongliang Mountain, you are the hometown of heroes!

　　中梁山——英雄的故乡
　　雁翼
    第一次从农村走进城市的人，往往因那四通八达、多得数不清的街道，来往穿梭的汽车和电车，弄得眼花缭乱，我刚来到矿井时，也正是这样。
    电瓶（以电池作动力）列车，把你拉进大山的深处，使你感到这就是大山的胸膛了。在这里，车站的哨音响着，信号灯闪烁着，从各个巷道开来的大小不等的电瓶列车来往穿过，卫生员和医生背着红十字包拉开洞室的门，向各采区走去。机修站、变电所、救护室、充电房，都在大巷道两边的洞室里。像长廊一样的休息室里，矿工们一面吃着保健饭，一面谈笑着。这里真好像是城市的中心，多得数不清的巷道，从这里伸向各个采煤的掌子面，那各个巷道的深处，有钻孔机、风镐和风锤、装岩机和电溜子，奏着音乐，无数颗星星——矿工头上的矿灯，在机器响处闪闪铄铄。煤，那闪光的乌金，工业的粮食，从这里一列车一列车地奔出矿井，送向炼焦厂、钢铁厂。
    原来，我以为这就是矿井了，其实不然，当你走出长廊，两扇巨大的铁门打开，把你迎进密封似的房间——升降机，随着铃响，一眨眼工夫把你升上了二层大巷，三层大巷，四层大巷。谁知道还有多少层！每一层，都同第一层完全一样；大小不等的电瓶列车，四通八达的巷道。电缆、送风管、抽风洞、水管，长龙一般在各个巷道盘来盘去，风在吹，各种机械在鸣奏，到处是闪灼的矿灯，一条巷道又一条巷道，好像走进了迷宫。煤，从各个巷道里拉出来的煤车，机车把它们送进圆形的、转动的小屋，——这个圆形机器自动把煤翻进溜煤眼，而下面正像上面一样，早有一串串列车等着了，当它倾满，就呼叫着奔向前去。
    矿井，真像地下城市，但更像一座大洋楼，一层又一层，从地面直到大山的峰顶，由升降机把各层联在一起，不过这“楼”非常非常的大罢了。
    这就是我们祖国第一个五年计划开始兴建，提前一年投入生产的现代化矿山——中梁山煤矿。在这里，我看到了许多最先进的机械设备。但，最最使人激动的，是以现代最最先进的思想——毛泽东思想武装起来的人！
    这里有好多全国、全省、全市、全矿的有名人物，他们的照片挂在市里的文化宫，矿里的光荣亭，吸引着、鼓舞着千百万人们的心，立壮志去建设祖国。这些有名人物，创造奇迹的英雄，就战斗在各个巷道，和群众一起为祖国有更多的煤炭，有更多的钢铁而战，有征服自然，战胜瓦斯的王执中，也有哪里有困难、有危险，就在哪里出现的李光林，有善于团结群众，教育群众、回收坑木达到90％的廖光辉，也有大胆革新技术，创造了多台自动风钻支架的钟文富。有五个月零四天完成全年生产任务的大组，也有用炉碴制成坑木，从锯木末里取出油来的技术革命勇将。他们英雄的事迹是无法写完的。但，当你问起他们来，他们总是用“没有啥”来作为回答。因为在他们的雄心壮志里，有着更高的要求，更大的计划，已经创造的成绩和将要创造的成绩比起来，在他们看来总是很小很小。
    在井长室里，你会常常遇见要求把最困难的任务交给自己的人，甚至相互争的脸红。
    当你从接班室里，从巷道里，从升降机里，从休息室里，或者从向回开的列车上遇见他们，相互打招呼的第一句话就是“怎么样”？
  “完成了”！或“又超额了”！这种最最平常的招呼，不正典型的说明了作为矿工的荣誉感吗？！
    这就是矿工的风格：“到最困难的地方去”，“完成了”，“超额了”。
    是的，就是他们，提前一年为祖国建成了这座现代化矿山。1954年，这里还是一片荒山，还是一片虎豹、野猪统治的荒山，是他们用双手把这里建成了灯光辉煌，洋楼成群，汽车火车来往的煤城。国民党时代，官僚们依靠美帝国主义的专家在这里开过煤矿，但因为瓦斯大，而终于封闭了。可是瓦斯，这个矿工的凶恶的敌人，却在今天的矿工们手里屈服了，献出了乌金。
    “变得真快呀！”这是每一个曾经到过中梁山的人的感叹语。是的，矿工们在党的领导下，在毛泽东战无不胜的思想指导下，用资产阶级专家不可想像的速度，把它完成了。这是我们党建设社会主义总路线的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我记起了煤管局局长的一句话，“这里出煤，但更出英雄！”是的，我们的建设速度快，人成长的更快。
    你看，一位在旧社会不识字的矿工，现在是这座现代化煤矿的党委副书记；一位转业战士，现在是管理生产的行家；一位在旧社会当童工的年轻人，现在是治服瓦斯的英雄，1958年7月从农村来的青年农民廖光辉，现在是一个采煤区的负责人。而李光林，这位才刚满二十二岁的青年人，也是1958年才从军队复员下来的战士。这样的人物数也数不完，他们都成了采煤的骨干。
    中梁山啊中梁山，你因为英雄的矿工而出名，而你也锻炼了英雄的矿工，使多少普通的农民在参加工业生产后成长为真正的矿工。他们从四面八方走来，把你从一座荒山变成一座祖国的煤城，你雄伟的、灯光灿烂的身姿，不正是矿工们的形象！难怪他们欢唱：“中梁山是个好地方……它是我们亲爱的家乡！”
    他们把你认作家乡，并且正用敢想、敢做的共产主义风格把你建设得更美丽；“世界上有的，我们也要有，世界上没有的，我们就创造，世界上不敢作的，我们要来作！”这就是中梁山矿工们的誓言！
    啊，就算我有一千双手，也无法写完这里的英雄事迹！
    中梁山呵！你是英雄的故乡！
