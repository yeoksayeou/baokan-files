		Poets Go Among the Masses to Recite
		Cheng Xin
	
	Forms like "Poetry Flyers" and "Poetry Picture Windows" were once welcomed by the people. The main reason was that they shortened the distance between poetry and the masses, allowing poetry to come into contact with the masses more often.

	Not long ago, I attended a poetry recitation and concert held by poets and musicians in the capital at Zhongshan Park. I heard several poets personally reciting their own poems in front of the audience, poems that fiercely attacked American imperialism and supported the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is an inheritance of the fine traditions of past revolutionary poets. Their sincere, fighting emotions and impassioned tones resonated in the hearts of over three thousand audience members, arousing their common feelings. It made people feel that recitation has a different effect than just publishing in newspapers and periodicals; and poets reciting their own works has a different effect than actors.

	Poetry, especially good poetry, comes from the life and struggles of the masses, and there should be no question about whether it should return to the masses or serve the struggle. The best measure of a good poem is probably the effect it has when recited in front of the masses. Some poems seem interesting and sound okay when you hum them quietly to yourself, but when they are presented to the masses, they sink like a stone into the sea, without arousing any reaction. This is not the sea's fault, but rather that the poem itself lacks the necessary weight. Good poems, however, truly play the role of a bugle, making people's blood boil, stirring their hearts, and filling them with high spirits.

	We welcome more poems and more poets to come among the masses. Let poetry be more closely integrated with the current struggle and more closely connected with the boiling life. Use your fighting, passionate poems and recitations to encourage the people's will to fight against imperialism, to encourage the people to be more full of confidence, to go all out, aim high, and strive for continuous leaps forward, and to encourage the heroic people to create more heroic achievements!

    诗人到群众中去朗诵
    成辛
    “诗传单”“诗画窗”这一类的形式，曾经受到人们的欢迎。那原因，主要就是缩短了诗和群众的距离，使诗跟群众接触得更多。
    不久以前，在中山公园参加了首都诗人、音乐家举行的诗歌朗诵演唱会。听到了好几位诗人亲自在观众面前朗诵自己的痛击美帝、支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民斗争的诗篇。这是继承了过去革命诗人的优良传统。他们的真挚的战斗的感情，慷慨激昂的声调，在三千多观众心底引起回响，引起共鸣，使人感觉到：朗诵，比起仅仅发表在报刊上，效果就是不同；诗人自己朗诵，比起演员，效果也不一样。
    诗，尤其是好的诗，既是来自群众的生活和斗争，在回到群众中去或是为斗争服务上，是不应该成为问题的。检验一首好诗，最好的尺度，恐怕就是在群众面前朗诵的效果。有些诗看来很有意思，自己低声吟咏，也还不错，但一到群众面前，竟如石沉大海，引不起什么反响。这不能怪大海，而是诗本身缺乏应有的重量。而好的诗呢，就确确实实起了号角的作用，使人热血沸腾，震动心弦，意气风发。
    我们欢迎更多的诗和更多的诗人到群众中来。让诗同当前的斗争结合得更紧，同沸腾的生活联系得更密切。用你们的战斗的热情的诗和朗诵，鼓舞人民群众反帝斗争的意志，鼓舞人民更加满怀信心，鼓足干劲，力争上游，实现持续跃进，鼓舞英雄的人民创造更多的英雄业绩！
