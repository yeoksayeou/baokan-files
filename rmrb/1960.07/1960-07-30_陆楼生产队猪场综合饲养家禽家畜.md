    Lu Lou Production Team Pig Farm Comprehensively Raises Poultry and Livestock

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Lu Lou Production Team of Yancang Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, taking pig raising as its foundation, comprehensively raises poultry and livestock, achieving a thriving livestock industry with pigs as the core.

    Since mid-April, the Lu Lou Production Team has only added a small amount of equipment. While the number of pigs in the pens increased from 402 to 740, they also raised 840 chickens, 247 ducks, 50 geese, 83 rabbits, 15 sheep, 127 white mice for medical research, and 1,300 fish, and cultivated 32 square meters of wood ear fungus. The pig farm is bustling with poultry and livestock.

    This team was a poor team. The all-round development of poultry and livestock breeding faced serious shortages of funds, sheds, and labor. In early April, when the production team's Party branch presented the "Catch Up With the Rich Teams" plan to the masses for discussion, how to solve these difficulties in developing poultry and livestock production became the focus of discussion for the entire team. Cadres and commune members offered suggestions based on their own experiences in raising poultry and livestock and what they had seen and heard. Local commune members used to raise chickens and ducks in pig pens, and some production teams in nearby communes also raised pigs and chickens and rabbits. After studying the above situation, the Party branch believed that this was a way to comprehensively develop poultry and livestock breeding. It decided to form a group consisting of the pig farm director and two breeders to start trial-raising other poultry and livestock. In addition to raising 41 sows and 39 weaned piglets, this group also raised 264 poultry, 70 rabbits, and 50 white mice. They fed chickens and rabbits when they fed pigs, and cleaned rabbit cages and mouse nests when they cleaned pig pens. Practice has proved that as long as various tasks are arranged reasonably, it does not take too much additional labor for breeders to raise other poultry and livestock at the same time, nor will it affect the good raising of pigs. Based on this experience, the pig farm began to comprehensively implement the integrated breeding of poultry and livestock.

    Comprehensive breeding of poultry and livestock has fully utilized the manpower, equipment, and land potential of the pig farm. The experience of this pig farm proves that comprehensive breeding of poultry and livestock also saves feed compared to single breeding. Flat-billed ducks cannot eat the rice bran feed completely, and pigs often throw pig feed out of the trough. The chickens in the farm come to peck and eat everything clean, and also search for undigested feed and small insects from the pig manure piles. The manure excreted by the ducks raised in the pond is also good fish food. According to calculations, each laying hen in the farm only needs to be fed about 2.5 taels of rice bran per day on average, which is more than one-third less than ordinary specialized chicken farms. In the past two months, the net income from selling chickens, ducks, and eggs in this pig farm alone has reached more than 400 yuan, which is equivalent to 76.1% of the pig feed costs of the entire farm during the same period. If the increased value of the poultry and livestock that continue to be raised through breeding and weight gain is included, the income from raising other poultry and livestock in this farm in two months will be even higher.

### 陆楼生产队猪场综合饲养家禽家畜

    陆楼生产队猪场综合饲养家禽家畜
    本报讯　上海市南汇县盐仓公社陆楼生产队以养猪为基础，综合饲养禽畜，做到了以猪为首、六畜兴旺。
    陆楼生产队4月中旬以来，仅增加少量设备，圈存的猪由四百零二头增加到七百四十头的同时，养了八百四十只鸡、二百四十七只鸭、五十只鹅、八十三只兔、十五头羊、一百二十七只供医学研究用的白鼠和一千三百尾鱼，还培植了三十二平方米的木耳。猪场禽畜满棚，一片活跃景象。
    这个队是穷队，全面发展禽畜饲养感到资金、棚舍、劳动力严重不足。生产队党支部在4月初，把“赶富队”规划交给群众讨论时，怎样解决发展禽畜生产的这些困难，成了全队议论的中心。干部和社员根据自己饲养禽畜的经验和所见所闻纷纷献计献策。当地社员过去常在猪圈里养鸡鸭，附近公社有的生产队也有的养猪兼养鸡兔。党支部研究以上情况后，认为这是全面发展禽畜饲养的一条途径，确定由养猪场场长和两个饲养员组成小组，着手试养其他禽畜。这个小组养老母猪四十一头，断奶小猪三十九头外，还养了二百六十四只家禽、七十只兔和五十只白鼠。他们喂猪时便喂鸡喂兔，打扫猪舍时捎带清理兔笼鼠窝。实践证明，只要合理安排各项工作，饲养员兼养一些其他禽畜并不增加过多劳动，也不会影响养好猪。根据这一经验，养猪场开始了全面实行禽畜的综合饲养。
    综合饲养禽畜，使养猪场的人力、设备和土地潜力得到了充分的发挥。这个养猪场的经验证明，综合饲养禽畜，饲料也较单一饲养节省。扁嘴的鸭无法吃净糠秕饲料，猪也常把猪食抛撒槽外，场内的鸡群就来一一啄食干净，还从猪粪堆里寻食猪没有消化的饲料和孳生的小虫。这个场养的鸭子屙在池塘里的粪，也正好是鱼的饲料。据测算，场内每只产蛋鸡平均每天只需喂糠秕二点五两左右，比一般专业养鸡场要少三分之一以上。两个月来，这个养猪场仅出售鸡、鸭、蛋的纯收入就达四百多元，相当于同期全场猪饲料费用的76.1％。如果把继续在饲养中的禽畜繁殖、增重所增加的产值计算在内，这个场两个月内养其他禽畜的收入数字还要高。
