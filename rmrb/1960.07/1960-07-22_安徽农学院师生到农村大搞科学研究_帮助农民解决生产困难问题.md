Anhui Agricultural College Faculty and Students Conduct Scientific Research in Rural Areas to Help Farmers Solve Production Problems

    (Report from our newspaper) Anhui Agricultural College closely integrates teaching and scientific research with current agricultural production, mobilizing faculty and students to go to the mountains and the countryside, establish bases combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, and make every effort to support agricultural production.
    In order to further implement the Party's educational policy, the Anhui Agricultural College Party Committee deeply mobilized and organized faculty and students to go to the mountains and the countryside, to link up with people's communes, and to establish bases combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Currently, each department and major has established forty bases for wheat, rice, tea, and forestry in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui, between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and on the plains of northern Anhui. In these "three-combination" bases, the method of long-term residence is adopted, from spring plowing to the end of autumn harvest, teachers and students work together with commune members, cultivate experimental fields together, and also conduct investigations and research, summarize experience, and vigorously engage in scientific research. In vigorously engaging in scientific research, the method of on-site research and on-site promotion is adopted, which not only solves practical problems in production, but also promptly disseminates advanced science and technology, powerfully supporting agricultural production. This spring, cotton seedlings were severely lacking in the Changlinhe area of Feidong County. The teachers and students in this area conducted in-depth research in the fields and quickly developed a method of covering the seedlings with wheat bran, which greatly increased the survival rate of damaged seedlings and solved the problem of cotton seedling shortage. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, teachers and students helped the commune establish a local fertilizer factory, producing large quantities of azotobacter, phosphate bacteria, potassium bacteria, and antagonistic bacteria. The faculty and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department have now preliminarily researched and successfully developed a method for cultivating "Neurospora," solving the problem of feed for pig raising. Experiments have proved that the raw materials for cultivating "Neurospora" are wide-ranging, the cost is low, and it contains rich vitamins, which can make pigs fatten quickly, greatly benefiting the development of pig raising. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee also held an on-site meeting at the college. The "Neurospora" cultivation method successfully researched by teachers and students is now being promoted throughout the province.
    Starting from the needs of production, Anhui Agricultural College also runs various training courses, training more than 27,000 technicians for people's communes. They also assist people's communes in making soil fertilizer analyses, tests, identifications, and manufacturing and supplying more than 1,000 kinds of bacterial cultures.
    The integration of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor with current production needs by the faculty and students of this college not only supports agricultural production, but also enriches teaching content and improves teaching quality.

    安徽农学院师生到农村大搞科学研究
    帮助农民解决生产困难问题
    本报讯　安徽农学院把教学、科学研究与当前农业生产紧密结合起来，发动师生上山下乡，建立教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合基地，千方百计地支援农业生产。
    安徽农学院党委为了进一步深入地贯彻党的教育方针，深入发动和组织师生上山下乡，与人民公社挂钩，建立教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合的基地。目前，各系各专业已在皖南山区、江淮之间和淮北平原，建立了小麦、水稻、茶、林等四十个基地。在这些“三结合”的基地，采取长期住点的办法，从春耕到秋收结束，师生们和社员共同劳动，共同种试验田，还进行调查研究，总结经验，大搞科学研究。在大搞科学研究中，采取就地研究和就地推广的办法，既解决了生产中的实际问题，又及时传播了先进科学技术，有力地支援了农业生产。肥东县长临河地区今春棉花缺苗很多，在这个地区的师生们深入田间进行研究，很快就研究出用麦糠复盖的方法，使损苗成活率大大提高，解决了棉花缺苗的问题。为了解决肥料问题，师生们帮助公社建立了土化肥厂，生产大量的固氮菌、磷细菌、钾细菌，抗生菌等。畜牧兽医系的师生们现已初步研究成功“链孢霉”的培制方法，解决了养猪的饲料问题。试验证明，培制“链孢霉”的原料很广，成本又低，并含有丰富的维生素，可以使猪成肥快，大大有利于发展养猪事业。中共安徽省委还在这个学院召开了现场会议，师生们研究成功的“链孢霉”培植方法，现已在全省范围内推广。
    安徽农学院还从生产需要出发，开办各种训练班，先后共为公社培养技术员二万七千多人。他们还协助人民公社作土化肥分析、化验、鉴定和制造供应各种菌种一千多种。
    这个学院师生把教学、科学研究、生产劳动与当前生产需要结合起来，不但支援了农业生产，而且丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。
