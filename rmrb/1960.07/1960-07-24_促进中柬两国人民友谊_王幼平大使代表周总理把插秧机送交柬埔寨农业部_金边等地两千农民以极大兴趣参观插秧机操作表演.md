Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 21st. Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia, Wang Youping, today, on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai, presented two rice transplanters – the "Liling No. 2" and the "Nan 105B type" – as well as blueprints, which Premier Zhou had gifted to Prince Sihanouk, to the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture.

Cheng Heng, Secretary of State of the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, on behalf of the Cambodian government and people, expressed his deep gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai.

At the same time, Ambassador Wang Youping also presented three locally manufactured "Liling No. 2" transplanters to the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture.

The inventors of these two types of rice transplanters, He Jisheng and Ni Jiwei, had already conducted operation demonstrations for two thousand Cambodian farmers in Phnom Penh, Kandal, and Takeo from the 18th to the 20th. Ambassador Wang Youping, Cambodian Secretary of State for Agriculture Cheng Heng, the Deputy Governor of Kandal Province, the Governor of Takeo Province, and others visited the demonstrations.

Cambodian farmers visited the operation of these two transplanters by their inventors with great interest. Some farmers and carpenters even brought pens and paper to draw diagrams of the transplanters on the spot.

Many farmers also personally used the "Liling No. 2" to practice transplanting. When Cambodian farmers were using the transplanters, the inventors of the machines enthusiastically guided the Cambodian farmers' hands, teaching them the operating techniques.

After three days of demonstrations in different soil types, visitors said that this transplanter can be completely used in Cambodia. In particular, the "Liling No. 2" has the advantages of simple construction, low cost, high work efficiency, and reducing the labor intensity of farmers. An old farmer said: "I am over sixty years old, and today is the first time I have seen such a good rice transplanting method."

Cheng Heng, Secretary of State of the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, said after visiting the demonstration that Premier Zhou Enlai's gift of these two transplanters to Prince Sihanouk, and the dispatch of the inventors to guide their use, are very beneficial to promoting friendship between China and Cambodia.

    金边等地两千农民以极大兴趣参观插秧机操作表演
    新华社金边21日电　中国驻柬埔寨大使王幼平今天代表周恩来总理把周总理送给西哈努克亲王的两部水稻插秧机——“醴陵二号”和“南一○五B型”以及图纸交送给柬埔寨农业部。
    柬埔寨农业部国务秘书郑兴代表柬埔寨政府和人民，对周恩来总理表示深切的感谢。
    同时，王幼平大使还把在当地仿制的三部“醴陵二号”赠送给柬埔寨农业部。
    这两种水稻插秧机的发明者贺继生和倪己维已经在18日到20日在金边、干丹、茶胶等地向两千名柬埔寨农民进行了操作表演。王幼平大使、柬埔寨农业部国务秘书郑兴、干丹省副省长、茶胶省长等都参观了表演。
    柬埔寨农民以极大的兴趣参观了这两种插秧机的发明者使用这两部插秧机的操作情况。有的农民和木匠还带了笔和纸，当场描绘了插秧机的图样。
    许多农民还亲自使用了“醴陵二号”练习插秧。在柬埔寨农民使用插秧机的时候，这部机器的发明者热情地把着柬埔寨农民的手把使用技术教给他们。
    经过三天在不同土质的地里表演，参观过的人都说，这种插秧机完全可以在柬埔寨使用。特别是“醴陵二号”具有构造简单，工本便宜，工作效率高和减轻农民的劳动强度等优点。有一位老农民说：“我活了六十多岁，今天才看到这样好的插秧办法。”
    柬埔寨农业部国务秘书郑兴在参观了表演后说，周恩来总理送给西哈努克亲王这两部插秧机，还派发明人来指导使用，这对促进中柬两国的友谊很有好处。
