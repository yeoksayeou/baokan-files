Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 28th - An Chengxiang, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, bravely fought against landlord elements who were undermining the people's commune and sabotaging the socialist cause in order to protect collective property. Despite suffering nine knife wounds, she remained courageous and unyielding, persisting in the struggle and ultimately enabling the capture of the enemy. Her selfless communist spirit has become a model for millions to learn from and has earned her the title of "Guizhou's Xu Xuehui." The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently issued a notice calling on all young people in the province to learn from her.

An Chengxiang is sixteen years old this year and works as a cook in the Shuikousi Public Canteen of the Qinggangpo Commune in Sinan County. On the evening of February 14th this year, two of the canteen's three cooks went home due to errands, leaving only An Chengxiang. This team had previously cracked a case of landlord elements stealing grain, so she was extra careful, sleeping on top of a well-locked cabinet full of rice.

At approximately 11:00 PM, the landlord element An Laowu, carrying a large hemp bag around his waist, sneaked into the canteen like a venomous snake and walked to the cabinet, preparing to twist the lock. When he discovered someone sleeping on the cabinet, wicked thoughts arose. He tiptoed to the stove and found a kitchen knife. In an instant, An Chengxiang was slashed three times on the head, and a sharp pain awakened her. She immediately understood what was happening and jumped off the cabinet, lunging fiercely at the enemy. She grabbed the enemy's collar with one hand and desperately tried to seize the kitchen knife with the other. In the fierce struggle, An Chengxiang was wounded six more times. An Chengxiang's head became dizzy, but she gritted her teeth and used all her strength to fight the enemy. Finally, the kitchen knife was knocked out of the enemy's hand. An Chengxiang, due to excessive blood loss, could no longer support herself and fell down. The strong and fearless girl, lying on the ground, still clung tightly to the enemy's feet, enduring the severe pain and hoarsely shouting, "There's a robber stealing grain!" "Come quickly!" The shouts startled the landlord element An Laowu, who panicked and desperately tried to escape through the door. However, his feet were tightly held by An Chengxiang. The enemy struggled to move forward one step, and An Chengxiang felt a sharp pain all over her body. In this way, she held onto the enemy tightly, refusing to let go until commune members heard the shouts and arrived to capture the enemy. At this point, An Chengxiang had already fainted.

After being injured, An Chengxiang stayed in the hospital, constantly thinking about the canteen. Lying in her hospital bed, she repeatedly asked the nurses to make phone calls to inquire about the canteen's work situation.

After An Chengxiang was injured, she received meticulous care from the Party and the commune members. The county Party secretary, the commune Party committee secretary, and many cadres and commune members personally visited An Chengxiang's condition. Many people wrote letters to her, expressing their sympathy and saying that they would learn from her. Her canteen was covered with letters of sympathy, big-character posters, and challenge letters. This gave her even greater encouragement. Now, An Chengxiang is once again active in the canteen, engaged in the cooking work she loves.

    贵州出现一位徐学惠式的新人物
    安成香奋不顾身保卫公社财富
    据新华社贵阳28日电　贵州省思南县女共青团员安成香，为了保卫集体财富，同破坏人民公社、破坏社会主义事业的地主分子进行英勇的搏斗，身受九处刀伤，仍然英勇不屈，坚持斗争，终于使敌人就擒。她这种舍己为公的共产主义品质，已成为千百万人学习的榜样，被誉为贵州的徐学惠。共青团贵州省委最近发出通知，号召全省青年向她学习。
    安成香今年十六岁，是思南县青杠坡公社水口寺公共食堂的炊事员。今年2月14日晚上，食堂的三个炊事员有两个因事回家了，只剩下安成香。这个小队曾破获过地主分子偷粮的事件，所以她格外小心，睡在装满大米上好锁的柜子上。
    大约晚上十一点钟，地主分子安老伍腰中挂着大麻布袋，像一条毒蛇钻进了食堂，走到柜子边准备扭锁。当他发现柜上有人睡觉时，就起了凶恶的念头。他蹑手蹑脚在灶头上摸到了一把菜刀。刹那间，安成香的头部被砍三刀，一阵剧痛使她惊醒过来。她立刻明白这里发生了什么事，跳下柜子，猛烈地扑向敌人。她一手抓住敌人的衣领，一手死劲去夺菜刀。激烈的争夺中，安成香又被刀伤了六处。安成香的头昏了起来，但她咬紧牙关，使尽全身的力气和敌人搏斗。终于，敌人手中的菜刀被夺落了。安成香因流血过多，身子越来越支持不住，倒了下来。坚强无畏的姑娘躺倒在地上，仍然死抱住敌人的脚不放，她忍着剧痛，嘶哑地大声喊着：“有强盗偷粮食呵！”“快来人呵！”呼喊声使地主分子安老伍惊慌失措，拼命夺门逃跑。可是，他的脚被安成香抱得紧紧的。敌人费力地向前挪动一步，安成香的全身就是一阵剧痛。就这样，她狠狠抱住敌人不放，直到社员闻声赶到，擒住敌人。这时，安成香已昏迷过去。
    安成香受伤后，住在医院里，时时惦念着食堂。她躺在病床上，还不断请护士代打电话探问食堂的工作情况。
    安成香受伤以后，受到党和社员群众的无微不至的关怀，县委书记、公社党委书记和许多干部、社员都亲自探望安成香的病情，许多人写信给她，慰问她的病情，并表示要向她学习。她所在的食堂，贴满了慰问信，大字报，挑战书。这使她受到了更大的鼓舞。现在，安成香又活跃在食堂里，从事自己所热爱的炊事工作了。
