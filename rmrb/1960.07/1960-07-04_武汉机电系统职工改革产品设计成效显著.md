Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 2nd: Since mid-May, workers in Wuhan's mechanical and electrical systems have launched a mass movement to reform product design. As of now, this system has innovated more than 70 old products, significantly saving steel materials and manufacturing man-hours.

In the vigorous campaign for product design revolution, all factories broke down the superstitious idea that "workers cannot engage in design," criticized the expert line, and vigorously promoted the "three-way combination" (of workers, technicians, and cadres). At the beginning of the movement, they put forward relatively clear goals, determined to achieve "three highs" and "three lows" (i.e., improve product performance, improve quality, improve production efficiency, reduce raw material consumption, reduce man-hour consumption, and reduce costs). The Wuhan Prospecting Machinery Factory mobilized all workers to reform the design of water pumps, resulting in a 50% reduction in the weight of the water pump and a 33% reduction in manufacturing man-hours, greatly improving its effectiveness. The thirty-horsepower winch produced by Wuhan Metallurgical General Machinery Factory used to require more than six tons of pig iron to make one unit. After this revolution, the number of parts was reduced from the original 629 to 320, and the weight was reduced by 2,200 kilograms. The quality of the reformed winch has been tested and found to be fully qualified.

In the process of reforming product design, many factories have adopted the principles of moving from simple to complex, easy to difficult, partial reform, and step-by-step reform. The Hubei Tractor Factory continuously tapped the potential of the eight-horsepower diesel engine. First, the governor was improved, and then an oil dipper was used instead of the oil pump. These two reforms reduced a total of 147 parts, which can not only save the country more than 120 tons of metal materials, free up thirteen machine tools, and save more than 120 production workers, reducing costs by 15%, but also solve the contradiction that the factory had long faced between the production of small and medium-sized parts not keeping up with assembly.

    武汉机电系统职工改革产品设计成效显著
    据新华社武汉2日电　武汉市机电系统职工从5月中旬起，展开了改革产品设计的群众运动。截至目前为止，这个系统已经革新老产品七十多种，大大节省了钢铁材料和制造工时。
    在大搞产品设计革命中，各个工厂都破除了所谓“工人不能搞设计”的迷信思想，批判了专家路线，大搞“三结合”。他们在运动一开始就提出了比较明确的奋斗目标，决心实现“三高”、“三低”（即提高产品性能、提高质量、提高生产效率，降低原材料消耗、降低工时消耗、降低成本）。武汉探矿机械厂发动全厂职工改革水泵设计的结果，使水泵体重减轻二分之一，制造工时缩短三分之一，大大提高了使用效能。武汉冶金通用机械厂生产的三十马力卷扬机，过去做一台要六吨多生铁，经过这次革命，零件由原来六百二十九个减少到三百二十个，体重减轻了二千二百公斤。改革后的卷扬机经过试验，质量完全合格。
    在改革产品设计的过程中，许多工厂都采取了由简到繁、先易后难、局部改革、步步改革的原则。湖北拖拉机厂在八马力柴油机上不断挖掘潜力，先改进了调速器，后又用油瓢代替了机油泵，两次改革一共减少了一百四十七个零件，不仅可以为国家节约一百二十多吨金属材料，抽出十三台机床，节省一百二十多个生产工人，降低成本15％，而且解决了这个厂长期以来中小件生产跟不上装配的矛盾。
