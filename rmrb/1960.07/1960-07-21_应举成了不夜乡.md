    After our village achieved garden-style farming, agricultural mechanization, and chemical fertilization, we officially had electricity on the day we commemorated the Party's birthday. The commune members were extremely excited and sang praises of this new victory won under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Look! Thousands of electric lights shine brightly, dimming the stars; the night is like day, Yingju has become a sleepless village. Listen! Motors roar through the sky, breaking the silence of the night; news broadcasts and brass bands play, this sound comes from Beijing. Think! A beautiful life is like a flower, with no more hunger or cold sadness, the people are infinitely happy, and our hearts are towards the great Party.

    应举成了不夜乡
    中共河南封丘县应举人民公社  应举大队总支书记  崔若谷
    俺村在实现园田化，农具机械化，化学肥料化之后，又已经在纪念党的生日那一天正式送电了。社员们兴奋异常，纷纷歌颂在党和毛主席正确领导下获得的这一新的胜利。看，千支电灯辉煌，星星暗淡无光；黑夜犹如白昼，应举成了不夜乡。听！马达响彻空中，冲破夜的寂静；新闻广播，管乐齐鸣，这声音来自北京。想！美好的生活如花，再无饥寒悲伤，人民幸福无疆，心心向着伟大的党。
