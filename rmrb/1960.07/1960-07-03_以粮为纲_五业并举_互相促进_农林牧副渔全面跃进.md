Taking Grain as the Key Link, Developing Five Undertakings Simultaneously, Promoting Each Other
Achieving a Comprehensive Leap Forward in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Side Occupations, and Fishery

    (Reported by our newspaper) On the Yellow River Plain in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, one million Hui and Han people, with great ambition and high aspirations, and on the basis of exceeding the 400-jin per mu target of the National Agricultural Development Program last year, are launching a large-scale agricultural production increase campaign with the spirit of continuous revolution and the pace of continued leap forward. They are striving to increase the average grain yield per mu of existing paddy fields on the plain to 500 to 600 jin within two to three years, and to achieve great development in forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery, so as to build the Yellow River Plain into a high-yield agricultural area.
    This fertile Yellow River Plain, backed by the majestic Helan Mountains, with the rolling Yellow River flowing through it, and crisscrossed by canals along both banks, has a large amount of farmland and vast reclaimable wasteland, large forest areas and suitable grazing grasslands, as well as large areas of water resources for developing aquaculture. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the Hui and Han people have held high the red banner of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, enabling agricultural production on the plain to achieve high-speed development. Last year, the average grain yield per mu on the plain increased from 250 jin in 1957 to 401 jin. In terms of animal husbandry, the famous Tan sheep, which is produced here, has achieved bumper harvests for two consecutive years. Fishery production has increased fourteen times compared with before liberation, and forestry and side occupations have also developed greatly.
    This year, the Hui and Han people in the plain area have started to move towards becoming a high-yield agricultural area. From the beginning of the year, the agricultural production front has been filled with enthusiasm, and a new situation of simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery has emerged everywhere. In terms of grain production, under the guidance of the principle of combining multiple planting and harvesting with high-yield and multiple harvesting, the Hui and Han commune members in various people's communes are actively expanding the planting area, improving farming techniques, vigorously carrying out farmland capital construction, and doing everything possible to increase yield per unit area. In order to expand the cultivated area on the plain from the current 3.7 million mu to more than 5 million mu within two or three years, the people's communes, institutions, schools, and farm workers are currently marching towards the wasteland in separate routes. Under the slogan of "reclaiming and planting simultaneously, reclaiming wasteland and benefiting in the same year," the plan to reclaim 710,000 mu of wasteland this year is nearing completion, of which more than 300,000 mu have been planted with various crops. In terms of increasing yield per unit area, a mass movement of "transforming low-yield into high-yield, transforming alkaline land into fertile land, and making high-yield even higher" is surging forward. Commune members of all ethnic groups are determined to strive to achieve garden-style cultivation of the existing 3.2 million mu of irrigated land within three years, in order to ensure the rapid increase of grain yield per unit area and create conditions for mechanized farming. This year, the plain plans to complete the task of garden-style cultivation of one million mu, and now more than 80% has been completed. Water conservancy construction and soil improvement are the fundamental guarantees for establishing a high-yield agricultural area here. In order to ensure that the existing millions of mu of land are irrigated in a timely manner, and to meet the needs of the continuous expansion of cultivated land, more than 20,000 Hui and Han migrant workers at the Qinglongxia water conservancy hub project on the Yellow River are building the dam in a tense manner after successfully completing the diversion project, and completed the water release project ahead of schedule, ensuring that the farmland on the plain is irrigated in a timely manner this year. The large-scale "drainage as the key link, benefiting both drainage and irrigation" movement to build a drainage and irrigation network, which was launched on the plain this spring, has been successfully concluded. Many new canals and drainage projects have been newly built during the movement, and thousands of old drainage and irrigation ditches have been renovated and dredged, with a total of 15 million cubic meters of earth and stone completed.
    Under the guidance of the principle of taking grain as the key link and simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery, all people's communes have further unified planning for forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery, rationally arranged labor, and carried out large-scale capital construction, so that the five undertakings promote each other and bloom in all directions. In terms of animal husbandry, since the beginning of spring, good news has been coming frequently from the grasslands. The number of sheep has increased by more than 21% compared with the end of last year, and another bumper harvest has been achieved. High-yield groups of sheep with multiple births and multiple production have also appeared in many places. The spring livestock protection movement is being carried out vigorously. In terms of forestry, due to the superiority of the people's communes in having a large population, from the beginning of the afforestation movement this spring, more than 70,000 people have been organized into afforestation armies in various places, focusing on large-scale construction of sand-preventing forests, windbreak forests, bank-protecting forests, and soil and water conservation, combined with the construction of economic forests in the desert margins, on both banks of the Yellow River, and along the canals. As of the end of 1959, more than 270,000 mu of various trees planted have grown up. Along the sand prevention line, a sand prevention forest belt of more than 1,000 li is gradually taking shape. Aquaculture is also showing a prosperous scene. Various places are building fish ponds on a large scale, vigorously training freshwater aquaculture personnel. Many people's communes and production teams have combined with the construction of farmland water conservancy, and used wasteland and alkaline land to establish many fish farms, fish ponds, and fish ponds. In addition, fourteen state-run fish farms and four state-run fishing teams have been established. According to the autonomous region's plan, the fish production on the plain this year will double compared with last year, and the aquaculture area will expand to more than 150,000 mu within three years.

    以粮为纲　五业并举　互相促进
    农林牧副渔全面跃进
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区黄河平原上的一百万回、汉族人民，树雄心，立壮志，在去年粮食平均亩产超过农业发展纲要四百斤指标的基础上，以不断革命的精神和继续跃进的步伐，又开展了一个大规模的农业增产运动。争取在两三年内，使平原上现有水田的粮食平均亩产达到五百斤到六百斤，并使林、牧、副、渔也都得到巨大发展，把黄河平原建设成为农业高产区。
    这块沃野千里的黄河平原，西屏巍峨的贺兰山，滚滚的黄河穿流其间，沿河两岸渠道纵横，有大量的农田和广阔的可垦荒地，有大片的林产区和宜牧的草原，也有发展水产事业的大面积水面资源。1958年大跃进以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，回、汉族人民高举大跃进、人民公社的红旗，使平原上的农业生产获得了高速度的发展。去年平原上的粮食平均亩产量已由1957年的二百五十斤，提高到四百零一斤，在畜牧业生产方面，这里盛产的驰名全国的滩羊，又连续两年都获得了大丰收，渔业生产比解放前增长了十四倍，林业、副业也都有很大发展。
    今年，平原地区的回、汉族人民又开始了向农业高产区迈进的步伐。从年初一开始，农业生产战线上就热浪滚滚，到处出现农林牧副渔五业并举、蓬勃发展的新局面。在粮食生产方面，各人民公社的回汉族社员，在多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针指导下，正在一面积极扩大种植面积，一面改进耕作技术，大力进行农田基本建设，千方百计地提高单位面积产量。为了在两、三年内使平原上的耕地面积由现有的三百七十多万亩扩大到五百万亩以上，目前各人民公社、机关学校、农场职工分路向荒地进军。人们在“边垦、边种，当年开荒，当年收益”的口号下，今年七十一万亩的开荒计划已接近完成，其中有三十万多亩已种植了各种作物。在提高单位面积产量方面，一个
  “低产变高产、碱地变良田、高产更高产”的群众运动，正在汹涌澎湃地向前发展。各族社员决心在三年内争取现有的三百二十万亩水浇地，全部实现大系小畦园田化，以保证粮食单位面积产量迅速提高，并且为机械耕作创造条件。今年平原上计划实现大系小畦园田化一百万亩的任务，现在已经完成了80％以上。兴修水利和改良土壤是这里建立农业高产区的根本保证。为了使现有的数百万亩土地适时的得到灌溉，并满足不断扩大耕地的需要，黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程工地的两万多回汉族民工，在胜利完成截流工程后，紧张修筑拦河大坝，提前完成了放水工程，保证了今年平原上的农田及时得到灌溉。今年春季平原上开展的一个大规模的“以排为纲，排灌两利”的兴修排灌网运动，已经胜利结束，运动中新修了许多新的渠道和排水工程，整修和疏浚了千百条旧的排灌沟渠，共完成土石方一千五百万立方米。
    各人民公社在以粮为纲，农林牧副渔同时并举的方针指导下，都进一步对林、牧、副、渔各业作了统一规划，合理安排了劳力，进行大规模的基本建设，使五业互相促进，全面开花。在牧业方面，入春以来，草原上捷报频传。羊只已比去年底增殖21％多，获得了又一个大丰收。许多地方还出现了羊只多胎多产的高产群。春季保畜运动，正在轰轰烈烈的开展着。在林业方面，由于人民公社发挥了人多势大的优越性，今年春季造林运动一开始，各地就组织了七万多人的造林大军，在沙漠边缘，在黄河两岸和渠沟两旁，以大规模地营造防沙林、防风林、护岸林和水土保持为主，结合营造经济林。截至1959年底营造的各种林木，已经成长起来的有二十七万多亩，沿着防沙线，一条长达一千多华里的防沙林带正在逐步形成。水产事业也出现一片繁荣的景象，各地都大造鱼池，大力培训淡水养殖人材，许多人民公社、生产队都结合兴修农田水利，利用荒滩碱地，建立了许多养鱼场、鱼池和鱼塘等。另外还建立了国营养鱼场十四处，国营捕鱼队四个。根据自治区计划，今年平原上的鱼业产量将比去年翻一番，在三年内水产面积将扩大到十五万亩以上。
