Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, New York Dispatch: Some American bourgeois newspapers are desperately advocating that the United States can use the United Nations to "fill" the "vacuum" in the Congo.

The well-known bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 22nd: "The situation in the Congo is very bad, and the future of the Republic of the Congo is certainly full of huge troubles." He said that the United States can rely on "the United Nations under the talented management of Mr. Hammarskjöld."

Lippmann, with the tone of an imperialist, slandered the Congolese people as "completely unprepared for self-government" and that "it will take a long time to learn how to manage this country." In his view, when the Congolese people won independence from Belgian colonialism, a so-called "power vacuum" appeared in this "world's richest, largest, and most tempting underdeveloped territory." He pointed out that current world opinion will not allow the United States to directly "intervene." "Under these circumstances, if the United Nations did not already exist, it would have to be created." Lippmann praised the special force provided by the United Nations as precisely suited to the situation in the Congo.

Yesterday's editorial in the "Washington Post" also praised Hammarskjöld for showing his "true talent" in this operation.

The newspaper also took the opportunity to advocate the establishment of a force under the control of the United States, bearing the banner of the "United Nations," in order to seize the opportunity to infiltrate every newly independent country in Africa and be "prepared to deal with emergencies anywhere within hours of notification." The newspaper clamored: "The United Nations must generously meet this demand."

### 李普曼重弹“填补真空”的侵略滥调  鼓吹美国利用联合国渗入刚果

    李普曼重弹“填补真空”的侵略滥调
    鼓吹美国利用联合国渗入刚果
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：一些美国资产阶级报纸竭力鼓吹美国可以利用联合国去“填补”在刚果的“真空”。
    著名资产阶级政论家李普曼22日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上写道：“刚果的局势是非常糟糕的，刚果共和国的前途肯定是充满了巨大的麻烦”。他说，但是美国可以依靠“哈马舍尔德先生天才管理下那样的联合国”。
    李普曼以一副帝国主义者的口吻诬蔑刚果人民“完全没有自治的准备”，而且“需要很长时间才能学会如何管理这个国家”。在他看来，当刚果人民从比利时殖民主义手里争得独立的时候，在这个“世界上最富庶、最广大和最诱惑人的不发达领土”上就出现了所谓“权力的真空”。他指出，目前世界舆论不能容许美国直接“插进一手”，“在这种情况下，如果联合国不是已经存在的话，就必须创造出一个联合国来”。李普曼赞扬联合国所提供的恰好适合刚果局势的一支特殊部队。
    “华盛顿邮报”昨天的社论也称赞哈马舍尔德在这次行动中表现出了他的“真正才干”。
    这家报纸还乘机鼓吹在美国操纵下建立一支挂着“联合国”招牌的部队，以便伺机打入非洲每一个新独立的国家，并且“在得到通知后几小时内准备对付任何地方的紧急事件”。报纸叫嚷说：“联合国必须毫不吝啬地满足这种要求。”
