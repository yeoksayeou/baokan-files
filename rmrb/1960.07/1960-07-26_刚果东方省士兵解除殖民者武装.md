    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese soldiers fighting against the Belgian invading troops have disarmed all colonizers in Congo's Orientale Province.
    Some UN troops, commanded by UN Under-Secretary-General, the American Bunche, and European officers, are intensifying their occupation of Congolese cities. It is reported that a UN force occupied Luluabourg in Kasai Province on the 24th and induced 3,000 Congolese soldiers to lay down their arms. A UN spokesman told foreign reporters that the situation in Luluabourg was "quite tricky" because Congolese were holding on to the area near the airport.
    On the same day, another UN force entered the port of Boma at the mouth of the Congo River. Thus, the two major Congolese ports, Matadi and Boma, have been occupied by UN forces.
    UN officials in the Congo confirmed that UN troops are constantly advancing into northern and eastern Congo to control Congo's "security" and important departments.
    It is reported that the number of UN troops entering the Congo has exceeded 5,000, and the number is constantly increasing. At the same time, more than 100 US Air Force aircraft are operating in the Congo under the pretext of helping to airlift UN troops and supplies.
    After the UN forces took control of Leopoldville, the last batch of Belgian troops left the city on the 24th. Ignoring the Congolese people's demand for the immediate withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo, the Belgian authorities moved the Belgian troops withdrawn from Leopoldville to its military bases in the Congo and the interior of the Congo in order to continue their aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, July 25th: Some commentaries published in British newspapers reveal that Western colonial countries, led by the United States, want UN forces to remain in the Congo, thereby controlling the country.
    Yesterday's "Sunday Times" openly advocated UN trusteeship of the Congo. The newspaper said, "In the past, it was common to designate a country to be responsible for a trust territory, but this time (in the Congo) the United Nations will be responsible for this task."
    The newspaper praised imperialism for using UN forces to invade the Congo, and wrote triumphantly: Hammarskjöld "carefully" allowed sufficient Western troops to participate.
    The newspaper said that the first task of the UN forces at present is to disarm the Congolese army. The newspaper admitted that "it has been difficult to do this," and it advocated sending "more (UN) troops" to the Congo to "make considerable rapid progress in this regard."
    The newspaper argued that after disarming the Congolese army, the UN forces would stay in the Congo for "several years rather than several months" under the pretext of "restoring discipline" to the Congolese army and "training cadres" for the Congolese army.
    The British magazine "Foreign Report" also slandered the Congolese people as "completely unprepared for autonomy" and attempted to prove that "it is necessary for the UN police force to stay in the Congo for several years."

    刚果东方省士兵解除殖民者武装
    联合国军加紧侵占刚果城市　路路阿堡刚果士兵坚守机场地区
    英国报刊透露西方殖民国家企图利用联合国军队长期控制刚果
    新华社25日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：同比利时侵略军队进行斗争的刚果士兵已经解除了在刚果东方省的所有殖民者的武装。
    由联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇和欧洲军官指挥的一些联合国军队正在加紧侵占刚果的城市。据报道，联合国军一支部队24日占领了开赛省的路路阿堡，并且诱迫三千名刚果士兵放下武器。一个联合国发言人对外国记者说，路路阿堡“局势相当棘手”，因为刚果人坚守着机场附近的地区。
    同一天，联合国军的另一支部队进入刚果河口的波马港。因此，刚果两个主要港口马塔迪和波马都已经被联合国军占领。
    在刚果的联合国官员证实，联合国军队正在不断向刚果北部和东部前进，以控制刚果的“治安”和重要部门。
    据报道，目前，进入刚果的联合国军已经超过五千人，而且人数还在不断增加。同时有一百架以上的美国空军飞机正以帮助空运联合国军队和物资为借口在刚果活动。
    在联合国军控制利奥波德维尔后，比利时最后一批军队24日离开了这个城市。比利时当局不顾刚果人民提出的关于比利时军队立即撤出刚果的要求，把从利奥波德维尔撤出的比利时军队移到它在刚果的军事基地和刚果内地，以便继续进行侵略活动。
    新华社伦敦25日电　在英国报刊上发表的一些评论透露，以美国为首的西方殖民国家想让联合国部队赖在刚果，从而控制这个国家。
    昨天的“星期日泰晤士报”公然鼓吹联合国托管刚果，这家报纸说，“在过去通常指定一个国家担负一个托管领地的责任，而这次（在刚果）要由联合国担负这项任务了”。
    这家报纸称赞帝国主义利用联合国部队侵入刚果，并得意地写道：哈马舍尔德“小心谨慎地”让充分的西方国家军队参加进去。
    这家报纸说，联合国部队目前的第一项任务是解除刚果军队的武装，这家报纸承认，“作到这一点一直是困难的”，它主张向刚果派进“更多的（联合国）军队”以“在这方面取得相当迅速的进展”。
    这家报纸主张，在解除了刚果军队的武装以后，联合国部队就在使刚果部队“恢复纪律”和为刚果部队“训练干部”这种借口下，在刚果呆“几年的时间而不是几个月的时间”。
    英国“外事报道”杂志也诬蔑刚果人民“对自治毫无准备”，并且企图证明“有必要使联合国警察部队在刚果呆上几年”。
