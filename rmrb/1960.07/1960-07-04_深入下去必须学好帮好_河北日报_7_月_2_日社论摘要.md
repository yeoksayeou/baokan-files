    Going Deep Requires Learning Well and Helping Well
    Abstract of Hebei Daily Editorial on July 2nd

    Improving leadership is a matter of how to further deepen and improve. The "two-five system" leadership method is an effective way to solve the problem of deepening and improving. Because county and commune cadres spend more than 70% of their time going deep into the front lines, participating in production, leading production, and adhering to the "four togethers" (eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses), they can establish close ties with the masses, deeply understand the situation below, and improve their ability to lead production.

    Some people worry that cadres working with commune members contradicts leadership, and that going deep to "stay at a point" will affect overall consideration. This concern is completely unnecessary. In fact, when implementing the "two-five system" leadership method, cadres do not participate in production every day during their time spent at the grassroots level; and on the days they participate in production, they are not working in the fields all day long. Even when working with commune members, it is not impossible to exercise leadership. Several Party committee secretaries of the Qin Village People's Commune in Jiahe County, after implementing the "two-five system," used both their hands and brains in the current intense battle to resist drought and seize seedlings and protect seedlings. While working with commune members, they discussed and studied methods for developing water sources, retaining moisture, and improving work efficiency with team cadres and commune members, and personally experimented with and compared various approaches. In this way, they promptly discovered problems, found solutions, summarized the experiences of the masses, and held on-site meetings to promote those practical and feasible good methods, thereby promoting the rapid progress of drought resistance and seedling protection work. These practices tell us that when laboring together with commune members, we must not forget our responsibility as leaders for a moment; and when performing leadership duties, we must not forget to appear as ordinary laborers for a moment, and truly integrate with the masses. This is the concrete embodiment of the dialectical relationship between participating in production and leading production, both laboring and leading, being an ordinary laborer and yet not an ordinary laborer.

    In the process of promoting the "two-five system," various regions have continuously enriched and developed this leadership method. "Staying," "rotating," "learning," and "helping" are effective methods that many places have already adopted to make work even more in-depth. "Learning" and "helping" are the methods of "from the masses, to the masses," and "concentrating and persevering." "Staying" and "rotating" are methods of breaking through a point to drive the whole, and combining the individual with the general. In places where these aspects are done well, cadres have relatively clear goals when they go down to "stay at a point." That is to say, they have a clear idea of what the main task is, what problems to focus on solving, what key issue to tackle, or what experience to summarize. After arriving at the grassroots level, they also pay attention to conducting careful and meticulous investigation and research, grasp and analyze the main contradictions, and find solutions to the contradictions. At the same time, they use the method of combining staying and rotating, and combining points and areas, to understand the individual based on the general, and to find the general from the individual; and to understand more sparrows by dissecting one sparrow. By doing this, they can grasp the generally significant problems and directional experiences, and then promote them on a wider scale, driving the general.

    Experience has also proved that the key to doing a good job after cadres go deep is to learn well and help well. That is to say, in the process of completing the current work tasks, on the one hand, they learn from grassroots cadres, learn their excellent work style, and learn their experience in doing a good job in grassroots work and managing production and life; on the other hand, they help them improve, so that they can better master and implement the Party's policies and guidelines, improve their political and ideological level, and improve their ability to analyze practical problems. This kind of "learning" and "helping," cycling back and forth, is always very necessary. Countless facts have proved that paying attention to collecting the opinions and experiences of the masses at any time and place is a very good way to learn.

    Learning well is for the sake of helping well. Helping is to realize leadership. To help well, one cannot work alone, let alone take over everything, but should act as a consultant, a consultant on production, and even more so as a political consultant. Whether the help is good or not depends first on whether it has helped grassroots cadres and the masses summarize experience and find the laws of things; whether production and life are well arranged, whether the ideas and methods are well thought out, whether political and ideological work is well done, and whether practical problems are well solved. In a word, it depends on whether the consultant is doing a good job. At the same time, it also depends on how well the reliance on grassroots cadres and the masses, the giving play to the initiative of grassroots cadres, and the fundamental assistance to them in improving are done. If this is done well, the work will be good when the cadres are there, and the work will be good even when they are not there. It can be seen that whether or not leadership work can be done well after going deep, the main focus should be on this word "help." To help well, one must first learn well from the masses.

    Improving leadership style and leadership methods is a matter of adjusting the superstructure and the relations of production, it is a revolution, and first of all, it is a revolution in people's thinking, a struggle of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology." Because improving leadership methods is essentially a struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, a struggle between the Marxist-Leninist leadership method and the bureaucratic work style that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. The more thorough the criticism of bureaucratic work style, the faster and better the new leadership methods and leadership style can be established. Promoting the "two-five system" leadership method is a revolution in leadership methods. Therefore, in the process of promoting it, we must not only solve problems in methods, but also solve problems in ideology. The process of implementing the "two-five system" is a rectification movement in the practice of leadership work. If we persist in doing this, we will surely make leadership work deepen step by step, improve and improve again, and continuously adapt to the needs of the new situation and the high-speed development of productive forces.

    深入下去必须学好帮好
    河北日报7月2日社论摘要
    改进领导的问题，就是如何进一步深入和提高的问题。“二五制”的领导方法，是解决深入和提高问题的有效方法。因为，县、社干部经常以70％以上的时间深入到第一线去，参加生产，领导生产，坚持“四同”（与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量），就可以和群众建立密切的联系，深入地了解下情，提高领导生产的本领。
    有人担心，干部和社员一起劳动，同实现领导有矛盾，深入下去“蹲点”会影响对于面的照顾。这种担心是完全不必要的。实际上，推行“二五制”的领导方法，在干部深入下去的期间，并不是每天都去参加生产；在参加生产的日子，也不是一天到晚都在田间干活。就是在和社员一起干活的时候，也不是不能实现领导。交河县秦村人民公社的几位党委书记，推行“二五制”以后，在当前抗旱夺苗、保苗的紧张战斗中，手脑并用，一边和社员一起干活，一边同队干部和社员议论研究开发水源、保持水分、提高工效等方面的办法，并且亲自把各种作法拿来试验、比较。这样，及时地发现了问题，找出了办法，也总结了群众的经验，并且召开现场会议推行了那些切实可行的好办法，从而推动了抗旱保苗工作的迅速进展。这些做法告诉我们，当和社员共同劳动的时候，一时一刻也不能忘记作领导者的责任；当执行领导工作职务的时候，又一时一刻不可忘记以一个普通劳动者的身份出现，真正和群众打成一片。这就是参加生产和领导生产，既劳动又领导，是普通劳动者又不是普通劳动者这种辩证关系的具体体现。
    各地在推行“二五制”的过程中，使这一领导方法不断地得到了丰富和发展。蹲、转、学、帮等等，就是许多地方已经采用的使工作深入再深入的有效做法。“学”和“帮”，就是“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的方法，“蹲”和“转”，就是突破一点带动全面，把个别和一般相结合的方法。凡是在这些方面做得好的地方，干部下去“蹲点”的时候，事先都有比较明确的目的。就是说，下去的主要任务是什么，着重解决什么问题，围攻一个什么关键，或者是要总结哪方面的经验等等，都心中有数。到了下边之后，又注意进行认真细致的调查研究，抓住和分析主要矛盾，并找出解决矛盾的办法。同时运用了蹲转结合、点面结合的方法，根据一般去认识个别，又从个别之中找出一般；通过解剖一只麻雀去认识更多的麻雀。这样做就可以抓住带普遍意义的问题和方向性的经验，然后进行面的推广，带动一般。
    经验还证明：干部深入下去以后，做好工作的关键在于学好和帮好。就是说，在完成当前工作任务当中，一方面向基层干部学习，学习他们的优良作风，学习他们作好基层工作，管好生产、生活的经验，另一方面，又帮助他们提高起来，更好地掌握和贯彻党的方针政策，提高政治思想水平，提高对于实际问题的分析能力。这样有“学”有“帮”，循环往复，在任何时候都是非常必要的，无数事实证明，随时随地注意集中群众的意见和经验，是一种很好的学习。
    学习好是为了要帮得好。帮，就是实现领导。要帮得好，就不能是单枪匹马地去干，更不能包办代替，而应当当参谋，当生产上的参谋，更要当政治参谋。帮得好不好，首先要看是否帮助基层干部和群众总结了经验，找出了事物的规律性；要看生产、生活安排得好不好，主意办法想得好不好，政治思想工作作得好不好，实际问题解决得好不好，一句话，就是参谋当得好不好。同时也还要看依靠基层干部和群众，发挥基层干部的主动性，和从根本上帮助他们提高做得怎么样。这一条做好了，干部在时工作好，不在时照样工作好。可见，深入下去以后是不是能把领导工作做好，主要的文章应当作在这个“帮”字上。要帮得好，首先又必须向群众学得好。
    改进领导作风和领导方法，是调整上层建筑和生产关系的问题，是一种革命，首先又是人们思想上的革命，是一场“兴无灭资”的斗争。因为改进领导方法，实质上是无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的一种斗争，是马克思列宁主义的领导方法与脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风的斗争。对官僚主义作风批判越彻底，新的领导方法、领导作风才能越快越好地树立起来。推行“二五制”的领导方法，是领导方法上的革命，因此，在推行的过程中，不但要解决方法上的问题，还要解决思想上的问题，贯彻推行“二五制”的过程，就是在领导工作实践活动中进行整风。这样坚持地做下去，我们就一定会使领导工作步步深入，提高再提高，不断适应新形势和生产力高速度发展的需要。
