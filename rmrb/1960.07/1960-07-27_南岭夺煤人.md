　　Ten Duck Eggs, Profound Friendship

　　In early May, the Nanling Coal Mine received a gift: a small wooden box containing ten large duck eggs. Each egg had a red paper-cut heart pasted on it, and the eggshells and the box were covered with enthusiastic poems. One of the poems, from all the workers of the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant to the coal miners, read:

　　　　Ten duck eggs, ten thousand hearts, a thousand miles of duck down, deep friendship.
　　　　Triumphant songs in the battle to seize steel, the credit goes first to the coal miners.
　　　　To celebrate further victories on the front lines, a precious gift is sent to the mines.
　　　　Steel and coal warriors fight together, guaranteeing a full production hall!

　　Speaking of these ten duck eggs, they have quite a story. They had crossed mountains and rivers, traveling over a thousand kilometers. Their entire journey was permeated with the deep friendship of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The duck eggs were originally produced by the Huazhou Construction People's Commune in Leizhou Peninsula last winter. To thank the local People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters for their merits in defending peaceful labor and their enthusiasm for supporting the commune's production day and night, the commune members sent some duck eggs to comfort them. The soldiers picked the ten largest duck eggs and gave them to their leader, who was reluctant to eat them and gave them to convalescing soldiers. The convalescing soldiers gave them to construction engineers, the construction engineers to artillerymen… Each time they were passed on, there was always a passionate letter accompanying the duck eggs to the person their previous owner thought most deserving to receive the gift. After several journeys and months, the ten duck eggs were finally transferred by the army to the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, where sparks flew. The steelworkers said, "Don't forget the well-diggers when you drink the water. The triumphant songs in the battle to seize steel are all thanks to the support of the coal miners." So they attached a poem and passed the duck eggs on to the coal miners of Guangzhou. The Guangzhou coal miners felt that they were the "little brothers" because the coal used in Guangzhou relied on the key coal mines in northern Guangdong. So, the ten duck eggs boarded a train to the southern foothills of the Five Ridges and were sent to the workers of the Nanling Coal Mine. People say it well: "One ton of Guangdong steel, one ton of Nanling coal." How could Guangdong's iron and steel industry's Great Leap Forward forget the workers of the Nanling Coal Mine!

　　A Debate on Whether There is a Future

　　Speaking of the Nanling Coal Mine, it's a long story.

　　The Nanling Coal Mine is located in northern Guangdong Province, bordering Hunan Province. More than a dozen large peaks stretch for over thirty kilometers, containing rich coal deposits, and are ideal for metallurgical coking coal. However, since 1920, when capitalists founded the Dili Company and officially started development, production had been intermittent. In early 1949, when Song Ziwen fled south to Guangdong, in order to plunder these resources, he shouted about "developing" the Nanling Coal Mine, building railways, transferring equipment, and even hiring an American "expert," Pearson, as a consultant. But they didn't accomplish much before they tucked their tails and ran away. At that time, the Nanling Coal Mine was already on its last breath. After liberation, after rectification, production improved significantly, and the output of raw coal in 1956 increased by about twelve times compared to 1950. However, some people, based on the complex geological conditions of the Nanling Coal Mine, rashly concluded that "Nanling has no future," saying that "the Guanxi mining area is all limestone and will not have any more coal," and that "restoring the Gouyadong vertical shaft is neither easy nor valuable," advocating for shutting it down. Was that really the case? If they had really shut it down like the metaphysical pessimists, where would the Nanling Coal Mine be today? And who would be sending duck eggs from thousands of miles away?

　　Before 1956, someone had already made a "conclusion" about the Guanxi mining area of Nanling: it was all basal conglomerate limestone and there was no more coal. In fact, not only did many geology books confirm that there was no coal under limestone, but many areas in the north also proved that there was indeed no coal under limestone. The urgent need for coking coal by Guangdong's iron and steel industry prompted daring and capable people to conduct scientific experiments to find out the truth.

　　At the beginning of this year, the drilling rig of the 152nd Geological Team was set up again in the Guanxi mining area. In mid-March, drilling rig No. 503 drilled to a depth of sixty-four meters, and the drill bit could not drill down any further. The technician took out the core and saw that it was indeed limestone. So, according to the "conventional" method of general coalfield geological exploration, the drilling rig was stopped and moved. At this time, the young engineer Guo Tianrong boldly raised a question: Are the geological structures of coalfields in the south the same as those in the north? The south needs coal so much. Wouldn't it be a great loss if there was coal under the limestone and we didn't develop it? Technician Zhang Baocheng also believed that the depth of the borehole was not enough to draw a conclusion.

　　The Party supported these opinions. After discussion, everyone was determined: just do it to the end, drill it to a depth of one hundred meters. The drilling rig was moved back to its original location and re-drilled. However, after drilling through different rock layers, even to a depth of ninety-three meters, it was still limestone. The limestone was as hard as steel, but the geologists' determination to find coal was even harder than steel. They thought of many ways and fought hard until April 30th. When they drilled to a depth of ninety-seven meters, they finally saw sandy shale, which meant they had reached the edge of the coal-bearing strata. Everyone was overjoyed and continued to drill downwards with a single-minded effort. When they drilled to a depth of one hundred and twenty-nine meters, the daring and capable people finally broke through the old conventions of geological theory and found black, oily coking coal under the limestone, and the coal seam was very thick. To further clarify the reserves in the entire area, the eight drilling rigs in the Guanxi mining area are still fighting day and night.

　　Let a Forty-Year-Old Mine Regain its Youth

　　In order to restore the old mines, people also demonstrated great wisdom and tenacious spirit.

　　Take the Gouyadong vertical shaft as an example! It was an old mine opened by the Dili Company forty years ago, and it had been opened and closed for a long time. Some people believed that this pair of vertical shafts had no value in being restored. Comrade Chen Yu, the sixty-year-old secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and governor, visited the site several times, crossing over mountains. He had been a miner and had many years of experience in the coal industry. He judged that the mines had extracted at most 30% of the coal in the past, and firmly advocated restoring them. The workers warmly supported Comrade Chen's opinion. However, a few individuals secretly poured cold water, saying that "there is no need to restore it, it is too difficult to restore." Indeed, there were many difficulties in restoring this old mine. The question was how people should deal with the difficulties.

　　The vertical shaft was one hundred and five meters deep. After decades of rock movement, the round shaft had been squeezed into an oval shape, the steel beams had also been bent, and some of the cylinder bricks of the shaft wall had also been squeezed and broken. Moreover, cracks had appeared in the shaft wall. In the wider places, you could insert your hand… However, no difficulty could frighten the working class. Chief Engineer Tan Ren, based on forty years of coal mining experience, proposed using the "inverted hanging shaft wall" method to restore the shaft. This method ensured construction safety, but the technology was a bit complicated. Xiao Xuezhi, the director of the work area, started working in the mines at the age of seventeen and had more than twenty years of mine construction experience. Restoring a forty-year-old mine was a first for him. He had never heard of "inverted hanging shaft walls" before. He firmly remembered Comrade Chen's instructions that the Gouyadong vertical shaft restoration project was a key project, and he had to be determined to overcome any difficulties. After going down the vertical shaft, his courage doubled: "What good coal! The coal seam several meters deep is shiny, oily, and doesn't have any gangue." The restoration project began. Xiao Xuezhi saw that there were few old mine construction workers, so he directed and taught the new workers himself. During the construction process, due to cracks in the shaft wall, whether it was sunny or rainy, water always flowed down the shaft, not only drenching the workers but also flowing along the shaft wall into the concrete formwork, washing away the uncured concrete. What to do? Give in? No, Old Xiao and the workers studied together and made a water-catching shed out of tar paper. Old Xiao himself sat in a吊桶 (diào tǒng - skip bucket) and climbed onto the steel beam to install the water-catching shed in the upper part of the shaft. In this way, the water seeping into the water-catching shed from the shaft wall would flow out of the holes, ensuring the quality of the concrete pouring and accelerating the progress of mine construction. Now, the most complicated part of the vertical shaft restoration project - the shaft restoration project - has been basically completed. It won't be long before the bottom roadway is restored, and the forty-year-old mine will regain its youth.

　　Advanced Surroundings, No Lagging Behind

　　The workers of the Nanling Coal Mine are not only responsible for construction tasks but also for arduous production tasks. According to the plan, the mine's output this year will increase threefold compared to last year.

　　To produce more coal, the workers launched a vigorous labor competition, chasing each other, and no one was willing to fall behind. The coal mining team led by Xie Jiafu in the Guanchun work area is an advanced production unit in the entire mine. He was determined to consolidate the 10,000-ton working face in the north section where he worked. Once, after he finished work and was about to go back to rest, he heard people in Huang Tiechen's team, who were taking over, discussing: "Our output is always not catching up, what should we do?" "Let them, the advanced ones, complete the task." Xie Jiafu immediately convened a team meeting and discussed with everyone: "The 10,000-ton working face is the banner of Guangdong's coal industry. To maintain this glory, we must help them." After the meeting, he took more than ten workers to the mine to help Huang Tiechen's team. Huang Tiechen's team was energized when they saw someone helping them, producing more than one hundred and thirty tons of coal per shift, setting a new record. Since then, the attendance rate of Huang Tiechen's team has increased, and the output has also increased.

　　In May, the Provincial Party Committee called for a coal-grabbing battle, and the entire section launched a competitive upsurge of "learning from Xie Jiafu, catching up with Xie Jiafu, and surpassing Xie Jiafu." On May 1st, Lin Deyun's team caught up with Xie Jiafu's team with a shift output of one hundred and twenty-six tons. On May 3rd, Xie Jiafu's team continued to lead with a shift output of one hundred and thirty-four tons. At present, Lin Deyun's team is striving for even higher goals. Through competition, the work efficiency of the north section in the first ten days of May reached 7.06 tons per person per shift, overfulfilling the state quota and increasing by more than 30% compared to the first ten days of April.

　　After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, the Nanling Coal Mine has developed from two work areas to six work areas, and the output has greatly increased. Large-scale capital construction is underway. In addition to mine construction, there are also coal washing plants, power plants, machine repair plants, coal storage, railways and other facilities under construction. In the quiet valley, trains and cars speed back and forth along the winding mountain roads, transporting coking coal to Guangzhou and transporting a large number of building materials back to the mine. At night, thousands of lights shine in the forests. The huge drilling towers towering on the mountainside are faintly visible in the vast mist. The rhythmic mechanical roar reverberates in the valley.

　　Nanling, Guangdong's emerging coking coal base, will grow rapidly under the nurturing of coal-grabbing heroes!

    南岭夺煤人
    本报记者　袁者萍
    十枚鸭蛋情谊深
    5月初，南岭煤矿收到了一份礼品：一个小木盒，里面装着十个大鸭蛋，每个鸭蛋上贴着一张纸剪的红心，蛋壳和盒子四周写满了热情洋溢的诗。其中有一首广州钢铁厂全体职工赠给采煤工人的诗，写着：
    十颗鸭蛋万颗心，千里鸭毛情谊深。
    夺钢大战奏凯歌，功劳首属采煤人。
    为祝前线再立功，珍贵礼品矿山送。
    钢煤战士齐奋战，保证生产满堂红！
    说起这十个鸭蛋，来头可不简单。它们曾经翻山越岭，渡江跨海，旅行了上千公里的路程。它们的整个旅程贯串了工农兵的深情厚谊。鸭蛋本是去年冬天雷州半岛化州建设人民公社的产品。社员们为了感谢当地解放军指战员保卫和平劳动的功绩，感谢他们披星戴月支援公社生产的热情，送了一些鸭蛋慰劳他们。战士们挑了十个最大的鸭蛋送给首长，首长舍不得吃，转赠给了休养员，休养员送给工兵，工兵送给炮兵……。每转送一次总有一封热情洋溢的信，伴随着鸭蛋传给它的主人认为最值得接受这份礼物的人。几度跋涉，几经日月，十个鸭蛋终于由部队转到了钢花四溅的广州钢铁厂。钢铁工人说，饮水不忘掘井人，夺钢大战奏凯歌，全仗煤炭工人的支援，于是附上一首诗，又把鸭蛋转赠给广州的煤炭工人。广州煤炭工人觉得自己是“小弟弟”，广州用的煤要靠粤北的重点煤矿。于是，十个鸭蛋又搭上火车来到了五岭山脉南麓，送到了南岭煤矿的工人手里。人们说得好：“一吨广东钢，一吨南岭煤。”广东的钢铁工业大跃进，哪忘得了南岭煤矿的工人呵！
    有无前途之争
    提起南岭煤矿，说来话长。
    南岭煤矿位于广东省北部，同湖南省交界。十多个大山峰，绵延三十多公里，蕴藏着丰富的煤藏，而且是理想的冶金焦煤。但是，这个煤矿从1920年资本家创办地利公司正式开发起，生产一直时停时续。1949年初，宋子文南逃到广东时，为了掠夺这笔资源，高喊要“开发”南岭煤矿，修铁路，调设备，还请了一位美国“专家”皮尔森来作顾问。但是没有搞出什么名堂，他们就夹起尾巴逃跑了。当时，南岭煤矿已是奄奄一息。解放以后，经过整顿，生产大有起色，1956年的原煤产量比1950年增长了十二倍左右。可是，有些人根据南岭煤矿地质情况复杂的特点，轻率地得出“南岭没有前途”的结论，说什么“关溪矿区都是石灰岩，不会再有煤了”，“狗牙洞竖井恢复既不容易，又没有价值”，主张收摊子。事实真个是这样吗？如果真的像形而上学的悲观论者那样收摊子，现在哪里还有南岭煤矿？也就不会有人千里送鸭蛋了。
    南岭的关溪矿区，在1956年以前就有人做了“结论”：这里都是基底角砾石灰岩，没有煤了。事实上，不仅许多地质学的书本上肯定石灰岩底下没有煤，而且北方许多地区也证明了石灰岩底下确实没有煤。广东省钢铁工业对焦煤的迫切需要，推动着敢想敢干的人们去进行科学试验，探明个究竟。
    今年年初，一五二地质队的钻机重新在关溪矿区架起来了。3月中旬，五零三号钻机打到六十四米深，钻头光钻不下，技术员把岩芯取上来一看，真是石灰岩。于是按照一般煤田地质勘探的“常规”，钻机停钻迁移。这时，年轻的工程师郭天荣大胆地提出了疑问：南方的煤田地质构造跟北方一样吗？南方这样需要煤，要是石灰岩底下有煤而不去开发，不是大损失吗？技术员张保成也认为钻孔的深度不够，不能作出结论。
    党支持了这些意见。经过讨论，大家下定决心：干脆干到底，打它一百米深。钻机搬回原地重打钻孔。可是，穿过不同的岩层，一直打到九十三米深，还是石灰岩。石灰岩硬得像钢，地质人员找煤的决心却比钢还硬。他们想了许多办法，苦战到4月30日，打到九十七米深的时候，终于见到了砂质页岩，就是说，打到含煤地层的边儿了。大伙儿惊喜交加，一股劲儿继续往下打。打到一百二十九米深，敢想敢干的人们到底突破了地质学说的陈规，在石灰岩底下找到了乌油的焦煤，而且煤层很厚。为了进一步弄清全区的储量，关溪矿区的八台钻机现在还在继续日夜奋战。
    让四十年老井恢复青春
    为了恢复旧井，人们也发挥了高度的智慧和顽强的干劲。
    就说狗牙洞那对竖井吧！它是四十年前地利公司开出来的老井，长期开开停停。有人认为，这对竖井已没有恢复的价值。六十多岁的省委书记、省长陈郁同志，几次越过崇山峻岭到现场视察。他曾经当过矿工，又拥有多年的煤炭工业方面的工作经验，他断定这对井过去最多不过采出了30％的煤，坚决主张把它恢复起来。工人们热烈拥护陈老的意见。但也有个别的人在暗中吹冷风，说什么“没有恢复的必要，要恢复太困难。”的确，要恢复这对旧井，困难是不少的，问题就看人们怎样来对待困难。
    竖井的井筒有一百零五米深，经过几十年的岩层移动，圆的井筒已给挤成了椭圆形，钢梁也压弯了，井壁的缸砖有些也挤压碎了。而且井壁已经发生裂缝，宽的地方，手都可以插进去……。但是，再大的困难也吓不倒工人阶级。总工程师谭仁根据四十年的煤矿工作经验，提议采用“倒挂井壁”的方法来恢复井筒。这个办法，确保了施工安全，只是技术复杂一点。工区主任萧学志，十七岁就下井干活，有二十多年的建井经验。恢复四十年的老井，在他还是第一次。“倒挂井壁”更没曾听说过。他牢牢记着陈老的嘱咐，狗牙洞竖井恢复工程是重点工程，再大的困难也要决心克服。下竖井一看，他更加勇气倍增：“多好的煤啊！几米深的煤层都是亮晶晶、乌油油的，一点儿?子也不夹。”恢复工程开始了，萧学志看到建井的老工人少，自己就一面指挥，一面把着手教新工人。施工过程中，由于井壁裂缝，井筒里不管是晴天雨天，总是哗啦哗啦地流水，不仅往工人身上淋，而且顺着井壁往混凝土的模子里灌，没有凝固的混凝土就给冲跑了。怎么办？屈服吗？不，老萧和工人一起研究，用油毛毡做了一个接水棚。老萧自己坐着吊桶爬到钢梁上，把这个接水棚装在井筒的上部。这么一来，井壁的水渗到接水棚就从孔里流下去，既保证了混凝土的浇灌质量，也加快了建井进度。现在，竖井恢复工程的最复杂部分——井筒恢复工程，已基本完成了。不要多久，再恢复了底部的巷道，四十年的老井就将恢复青春。
    先进周围无落后
    南岭煤矿的工人，不仅担负着建设任务，而且担负着艰巨的生产任务。按照计划，全矿今年的产量要比去年增长三倍。
    工人们为了多产煤，开展了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，你追我赶，谁也不甘落后。关春工区谢家福领导的采煤小组，是全矿的先进生产单位。他一心想巩固好他所在的北一段万吨工作面。有一次，他下工以后，正想回去休息，听到来接班的黄铁臣小组有人在议论：“我们产量老赶不上去，怎么办？”“就让他们先进的去完成任务算了。”谢家福马上召开了小组会，同大家商量：“万吨工作面是广东煤炭工业的旗帜。要保持这一光荣，我们就得帮助他们。”开完会，他就带着十多个工人，下矿帮助黄铁臣小组。黄铁臣小组见有人帮助自己，劲儿可足了，一班产煤一百三十多吨，创造了新纪录。从此以后，黄铁臣小组的出勤率提高了，产量也增长了。
    5月份，省委号召展开夺煤大会战，全段又掀起了“学习谢家福，赶上谢家福，超过谢家福”的竞赛热潮。5月1日，林德云小组以班产一百二十六吨，赶上了谢家福小组；5月3日，谢家福小组又以班产一百三十四吨继续领先。目前，林德云小组又正在向更高的目标奋斗。通过竞赛，北一段5月上旬的工效就达到了每人班产七点零六吨，超额完成了国家定额，比4月上旬提高了30％以上。
    经过两年的连续大跃进，南岭煤矿已由过去的两个工区发展到六个工区，产量大大增加。大规模的基本建设正在进行。除了矿井建设以外。正在建设的还有洗煤厂、发电厂、机修厂、煤仓、铁路等设施。静寂的山谷里，火车、汽车顺着弯弯曲曲的盘山道往来疾驰，把焦煤源源运往广州，又把大批建筑材料运回矿山。入夜，林木丛中万千盏灯火光辉闪烁。耸立在半山腰的巨形钻塔，在苍茫的烟雾中若隐若现。有节奏的机械轰鸣声，在山谷中回旋荡漾。
    南岭，广东新兴的炼焦煤基地，将在夺煤英雄的哺育下迅速成长壮大！
