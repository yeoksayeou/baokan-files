Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd. A commentary by a Xinhua News Agency reporter: Since Nobusuke Kishi was forced to announce his "determination to resign" on June 23rd but then delayed his resignation, new developments have taken place in the Japanese political situation. On the one hand, the Japanese people are pursuing their victory, demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and sounding the call to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance; on the other hand, U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group are plotting to use a "delaying tactic" to organize a new cabinet that is "old wine in new bottles" and actively implement the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," but their new conspiracy is being constantly crushed.

Kishi Nobusuke originally wanted to use the "ratification" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to gain further "appreciation" from his American masters, thereby establishing a "long-term stable regime." Kishi Nobusuke said at the beginning of this year: "It is my responsibility to build Japan after the revision of the Security Treaty." Until recently, he also stated that he would never "yield" to the mass movement. But in the face of the mighty mass movement against the new "Security Treaty," Kishi Nobusuke had no choice but to announce his decision to step down after "ratifying" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by despicable means.

The U.S. and Japanese ruling classes originally wanted to use the disgraced resignation of Kishi Nobusuke as a trick to deceive the Japanese people, attempting to divert the target of the anti-American patriotic struggle. Katsumi Hayakawa, managing director of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, openly said on the day Kishi Nobusuke announced his resignation: because the new "Security Treaty" was "ratified" and Prime Minister Kishi expressed his determination to resign, "it is expected that the reformist forces will probably have no further goals for struggle, and mass struggles will not arise in the future." However, this hope of the Japanese monopoly capitalist group has been dashed. The Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle has not stagnated. After victoriously ending the large-scale 19th National Unified Action on June 23rd, they immediately launched a strong 20th Unified Action from June 25th to July 2nd, and the anti-American slogans became louder and louder, and the target of the struggle became more and more focused on U.S. imperialism and its agents. The "Washington Post" lamented in an editorial entitled "What Will Happen to Japan Next?": In the future, "the Japanese will control their own destiny according to their own ideas." "In other words, the days when Japan obediently accepted the policies formulated by Washington are over."

Now, on the eve of the resignation of his entire cabinet, Kishi Nobusuke is stubbornly "devoting his best efforts" to his American masters. At the behest of the United States, he is planning to organize a cabinet that can continue to implement policies of subservience to the United States. While putting up a desperate struggle, Kishi Nobusuke is also frantically suppressing the patriotic movement, and after forcibly "ratifying" the new "Security Treaty," he immediately forcibly passed relevant domestic laws to implement the new "Security Treaty," and established the "Autonomous Prefecture," which is in fact equivalent to the notorious "Ministry of Home Affairs," and is actually implementing the new "Security Treaty" that betrays the interests of the Japanese nation regardless of the will of the Japanese people. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are also trying their best to delay the dissolution of the Japanese Diet, attempting to avoid the edge of the mass movement and choose a time that is favorable to the Japanese reactionaries to suddenly dissolve the Diet and hold a general election. However, Japanese progressive political parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life have shown their vigilance with actions. They have launched a pursuit-style struggle, step by step, resolutely demanding the immediate resignation of Kishi Nobusuke and the dissolution of the Diet, and opposing the organization of a "second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet." At the same time, Japanese trade union organizations have decided to use strong actions to counter the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to suppress the patriotic movement and to crush the new "Security Treaty." Currently, this struggle is being carried out fiercely.

The reason why the Japanese people are so confident in pursuing their victory is that after 20 nationwide unified actions, they have learned that resolute struggle is a good way to oppose the new "Security Treaty" and drive away the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism; they have understood the truth that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers from the victorious struggle to prevent Eisenhower's visit to Japan and force Kishi Nobusuke to announce his resignation. They are convinced that every unified action and every general strike will gather greater strength to strike the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and that each step brings them closer to final victory.

    新华社记者评当前日本政局
    日本人民正在信心百倍地乘胜前进
    岸信介拖延下台阴谋受到坚决打击
    新华社2日讯　本社记者述评：自从6月23日岸信介被迫宣布“决心辞职”但又拖延下台以来，日本政治局势有了新发展。一方面是日本人民乘胜追击、要求岸信介内阁立即下台，吹起了粉碎日美军事同盟的号角；另方面是美帝国主义和岸信介集团阴谋用“缓兵之计”组织“换汤不换药”的新内阁，积极执行新日美“安全条约”，但是它们的新阴谋正在遭到不断的打击。
    岸信介本想用“批准”新日美“安全条约”来取得美国主子的进一步“赏识”，从而建立“长期稳定政权”。岸信介在今年初说过：“建设改订安全条约以后的日本，是我的责任”。直到不久以前他还表示绝对不向群众运动“屈服”。而曾几何时，岸信介在雷霆万钧之势的反对新“安全条约”群众运动的面前，不得不在用卑鄙手法“批准”新日美“安全条约”以后，宣布决定下台。
    美日统治阶级本想用身败名裂的岸信介下台这着棋来欺骗日本人民，妄图转移反美爱国斗争的目标。日本经营者团体联盟专务理事早川胜在岸信介宣布要辞职的当天公开说：由于新“安全条约”获得“批准”、岸首相表明决心下台，“料想革新势力大概再没有什么斗争的目标，今后的群众斗争不会再有兴起”。但是，日本垄断资本集团的这个希望落空了。日本人民的反美爱国斗争并没有停滞下来，他们在6月23日胜利地结束了声势浩大的第十九次全国统一行动后，紧接着从6月25日到7月2日又展开了强有力的第二十次统一行动，而且反美的口号越来越响亮，斗争的目标越来越集中在美帝国主义及其代理人身上。“华盛顿邮报”在以“日本下一步将发生什么？”为题的社论中哀鸣道：今后“日本人将按照他们自己的想法来支配自己的命运。”“换言之，日本温顺地接受华盛顿所制订的政策的日子已经过去了”。
    现在，岸信介在他全体内阁下台的前夕，执迷不悟地为他的美国主子“鞠躬尽瘁”。他秉承美国的意旨，正在策划组织一个可以继续执行屈从美国政策的内阁。在作困兽之斗的同时，岸信介还在疯狂镇压爱国运动，并且在强行“批准”新“安全条约”后，紧接着又强行通过执行新“安全条约”的有关国内法，成立了事实上等于臭名远扬的“内务省”的“自治省”，实际上在不顾日本人民的意志执行着出卖日本民族利益的新“安全条约”。美日反动派还尽力拖延解散日本国会，妄图避过群众运动的锋芒，选择对日本反动派有利的时机突然解散国会和举行大选。然而，日本进步政党、团体和各阶层人民用行动表明了他们的警惕性，他们步步紧逼地展开了追击式的斗争，坚决要求岸信介立即下台和解散国会，反对组织“第二个岸信介内阁”。同时，日本工会团体已经决定以强有力的行动反击岸信介集团镇压爱国运动的阴谋和粉碎新“安全条约”。目前，这一斗争正在激烈地进行着。
    日本人民所以这样信心百倍地乘胜追击，是因为他们经过二十次全民性的统一行动以后，了解到坚决斗争是反对新“安全条约”和赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的好办法；他们从阻止了艾森豪威尔访日和迫使岸信介宣布下台的胜利斗争中懂得了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的真理。他们确信，每一次统一行动、每一次总罢工，都会集结更大的力量给日美反动派以打击，都是向最后胜利接近了一步。
