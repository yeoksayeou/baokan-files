    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 15th. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is seizing the current favorable opportunity to promote the experience of the Zao Lin Management District of Caijiapo Commune in Fengxiang County in developing pig raising at high speed, setting off a province-wide upsurge of all levels establishing pig farms and every household raising pigs.
    By the end of June this year, the Zao Lin Management District had a total of 14,262 pigs in stock (8,868 publicly raised, accounting for 62%; 5,394 privately raised, accounting for 38%), an increase of 40% compared to the end of last year, with an average of nearly five pigs per household. The development of pig raising has greatly promoted agricultural production and increased the income of commune members.
    The rapid development of pig raising in the Zao Lin Management District is primarily due to the comprehensive implementation of the principle of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as supplementary, and public and private raising side by side." In terms of public raising, two methods were adopted: cooperative and self-operated. Cooperative refers to the management district and the production team jointly running pig farms, with the management district providing funds and the production team providing land, labor, and feed. Self-operated is divided into two types: one is that production teams and production groups use sideline income to run pig farms, labor is drawn from each team, and feed is supplied from the agricultural and sideline products of the agricultural comprehensive experimental farms run by the team, with the team making unified adjustments for any deficiencies. The other is that production groups, on the premise of completing their contracted tasks, mainly use commune members' investment and the team's sideline income to run farms for pig raising. In addition, there is also pig raising by canteens. Most of the piglets are supplied by the team, and the feeders are the canteen managers and cooks. In addition to using leftover food and swill from the canteen, the team allocates some feed land. Various types of pig farms also have a division of labor: some pig farms mainly engage in breeding pigs and scientific experiments; some focus on raising sows to breed piglets, supplemented by fattening; some combine fattening and breeding; as for the fattening pigs raised by canteens and government units, they are mainly for self-sufficiency, with the surplus sold to the state.
    Another measure for the development of pig raising in the Zao Lin Management District is the adoption of "small-scale as the mainstay and large-scale as supplementary" for the scale of pig farms, based on the current situation of agricultural production. The entire management district has a total of 107 pig farms. Except for one pig farm jointly run by the management district and the Zao Lin Production Team, which has 214 pigs, the rest generally have 70 to 80 pigs. Because the scale of the pig farms is small, most of them are built in the fields, including 30 pig farms built in high-yield areas, which brings great convenience to agricultural production. At the same time, due to the small scale of the pig farms, waste and idle labor can be fully utilized to build pig farms, greatly saving construction funds. In addition, small-scale pig farms are more convenient in terms of feeding management, disease prevention, and so on.
    While vigorously developing collective pig raising, the Zao Lin Management District also vigorously develops private pig raising. They carried out publicity and education for households that were capable of raising pigs but had not yet done so, and helped them to raise pigs. For households in difficulty and those lacking piglets, the production team adopted methods such as transferring piglets from pig farms on credit, or raising them to maturity and then handing them over to the team. For pig-raising households lacking labor, the team combined manure accumulation and helped them to build walls and repair pens, transport soil to build pens on rainy days and during slack agricultural work. At the same time, they mobilized commune members to plant feed on private plots and collect feed during holidays and spare labor time to solve the problem of pig feed. In addition, they regularly conducted inspections and preventive injections, and constantly passed on advanced techniques and pig-raising experience to commune members to improve the level of pig raising among the masses. Because this policy was well implemented, now 99.5% of the commune members' households are raising pigs privately.
    The reason why the Zao Lin Management District has been able to comprehensively implement the principle of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as supplementary, and public and private raising side by side" is because it has strengthened the organizational leadership of the Party. The Party branch has held 16 special discussions on the issue of pig raising last year and 10 times in the first five months of this year. Resolutions have been made on relevant issues. Secretaries at all levels personally take charge, have pig-raising experimental plots to gain experience and guide the overall work. The pig-raising team has also been rectified, and loyal and reliable poor and lower-middle peasants and Party and League members have been selected as feeders. In order to strengthen business guidance, the management district has also established a Livestock and Poultry Guidance Committee and a veterinary station, and the production team has established a guidance group and a epidemic prevention group, with special personnel responsible for each team. At the same time, a red flag competition and an opponent competition between teams, farms, and people have been vigorously carried out to promote the rapid development of pig raising.
    In order to promote the experience of the Zao Lin Management District in developing pig raising at high speed, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting in this management district with the participation of secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county party committees in charge of pig raising, as well as directors of animal husbandry bureaus. Through discussions and on-site visits on issues such as guiding principles, division of labor in the operation of pig farms at all levels, and feed, the meeting exchanged experiences and will promote the rapid development of a province-wide upsurge of all levels running pig farms and every household raising pigs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 15th. Hezhang County, Guizhou Province, has implemented the principle of public and private raising side by side, adopting the method of small-scale pig farms run by production teams and public canteens as the mainstay, supplemented by large-scale pig farms and individual pig raising, accelerating the development of pig raising and becoming a red flag county for pig raising in Guizhou Province. As of the end of June, the number of pigs in stock at the county's 4,700 pig farms had reached more than 450,000, a net increase of more than 93,000 compared to the end of last year, and more than six times the increase since the early days of liberation. The county's more than 260,000 residents have an average of 1.7 pigs per person, and the three communes of Caishen, Hengdi, and Kele, as well as 27 management districts, have achieved one pig per mu of land.
    Vigorously developing pig raising by production teams and canteens is an important factor in the high-speed development of pigs in this county. Since March, the county has adopted the method of focusing on small teams, with the canteen as the center, five levels mobilized (state-owned, commune, production team, team, and commune members), and five routes of attack (rural areas, industry and mining, schools, government agencies, and troops) to vigorously run small-scale pig farms and fully tap the potential for pig raising. The Jile team of the Jifa Management District of Caishen Commune did not have a single pig in the past. After implementing the "five levels mobilized," the commune members happily said, This is really good this time, and the rice soup and fine bran from the canteen can be used to feed the pigs. Soon, 56 pigs were raised, with an average of more than two pigs per household. At present, of the more than 430,000 pigs collectively raised in the county, more than 370,000 are raised by production teams and production groups.
    In the development of pig raising, the Party organization of Hezhang County has strengthened its leadership over this work. The county and commune party committees have livestock departments, and are specifically equipped with secretaries and ministers in charge of pig raising. The management district and the production team have also designated a deputy secretary to take special care of pig raising. Party organizations at all levels in the county have placed pig raising on the regular agenda, regularly studying and deploying work, and constantly supervising and inspecting. Leaders at all levels personally run pig-raising "experimental plots," go deep into pig farms to work, and solve problems in a timely manner when they are discovered. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to vigorously develop feed bases, make full use of wild feed, and vigorously collect and store feed. In the first half of this year, the county collected more than 30 million jin of various agricultural and sideline product feeds during the summer harvest alone. (Attached picture)

　　贵州省赫章县加强领导发展小型猪场生猪迅速增长
    本报西安15日电　中共陕西省委抓紧当前有利时机，推广凤翔县蔡家坡公社枣林管理区高速度发展养猪事业的经验，在全省掀起各级办猪场，户户都养猪的高潮。
    到今年6月底为止，枣林管理区共存栏生猪一万四千二百六十二头（公养八千八百六十八头，占62％；私养五千三百九十四头，占38％），比去年年底增加40％，每户平均将近五头。养猪事业的发展大大促进了农业生产，增加了社员的收入。
    枣林管理区养猪获得迅速发展，首先是全面贯彻了“公养为主，私养为辅，公养、私养并举”的方针。在公养方面采取了合营、自营两种办法。合营是管理区与生产队合办猪场，管理区出钱，生产队出土地、劳力、饲料等。自营分两种，一种是生产队、生产小队以副业收入办猪场，劳力在各小队抽调，饲料由队内举办的农业综合试验场的农副产品中供给，不足部分由生产队统一调剂。一种是生产小队在完成自己承包任务的前提下，主要用社员投资和小队副业收入办场养猪。另外还有食堂养猪，猪仔大部分由小队供给，饲养员由食堂管理员和炊事员担任，饲料除用食堂的剩菜、泔水外，小队划给部分饲料地。各类养猪场也大体上分了工：有的猪场主要搞种猪繁殖和科学试验；有的以养母猪繁殖仔猪为主，育肥为辅；有的育肥、繁殖并举；至于食堂、机关单位养的肥猪，主要是自养自食，多余的卖给国家。
    枣林管理区养猪发展的另一项措施是根据目前农业生产的情况，对猪场的规模采取了“小型为主，大型为辅”的办法。全管理区共有一百零七个猪场，除管理区和枣林生产队合办的一个猪场有二百一十四头猪以外，其余一般都是七十至八十头。由于猪场的规模小，绝大部分都建立在田间，其中有三十个猪场建立在丰产方里，给农业生产带来了很大的方便。同时，由于猪场规模小，可以充分利用废物和闲散劳力建猪场，大大节省了建场的资金。此外，小型猪场在饲养管理、防治疫病等等方面，都比较方便。
    枣林管理区在大抓集体养猪的同时，大抓私人养猪。对能够养猪而没有养猪的户，进行了宣传教育，帮助他们养猪；对困难户和缺乏仔猪的户，生产队采取由猪场调剂仔猪、赊欠、喂大交队等办法；对缺乏劳力的养猪户，队内结合积肥，在阴雨天和农活较闲时，帮助他们打墙修圈、运土起圈，同时发动社员在自留地上种植饲料，利用假日和劳动空闲采集饲料，以解决养猪饲料问题。此外，还定期检查并进行预防注射，不断向社员传授先进技术和养猪经验，提高群众养猪的水平。由于这一政策贯彻得好，现在社员私人养猪户已达总户数的99.5％。
    枣林管理区所以能够全面贯彻“公养为主，私养为辅，公养、私养并举”的方针，是由于加强了党的组织领导。党总支在去年就养猪问题专门讨论过十六次，今年五个月中讨论了十次。有关问题都作出了决议。各级书记亲自挂帅，都有养猪试验田，取得经验，指导全面。对养猪队伍也进行了整顿，挑选了忠诚可靠的贫农、下中农和党团员担任饲养员。为了加强业务指导，管理区还设立了家畜家禽指导委员会、兽医站，生产队设立了指导小组和防疫小组，各个小队都有专人负责。同时，大力开展了队与队、场与场、人与人之间的红旗竞赛和对手赛，推动了养猪事业的迅速发展。
    为了推广枣林管理区高速度发展养猪事业的经验，中共陕西省委最近在这个管理区召开了有全省各地委、市委、县委主管养猪的书记以及畜牧局长参加的现场会议。这次会议通过对方针政策、各级猪场经营分工和饲料等问题的讨论和现场参观，交流经验，将推动全省迅速开展一个各级办猪场、户户都养猪的全民性养猪高潮。
    本报贵阳15日电　贵州省赫章县贯彻执行公养与私养并举的方针，采取以生产小队和公共食堂举办的小型养猪场为主，大型养猪场和个体养猪为辅办法，加速发展养猪事业，成为贵州省的养猪红旗县。截至6月底，全县四千七百个养猪场的生猪存栏数已达四十五万多头，比去年年底净增九万三千多头，比解放初期增加六倍多。全县二十六万多居民，平均每人有猪一点七头，并有财神、恒底、可乐等三个公社和二十七个管理区实现每亩地一头猪。
    大力发展生产小队和食堂养猪，是这个县生猪高速度发展的重要因素。全县3月份以来，采取以小队为主，以食堂为中心，五级动手（国营、公社、生产队、小队、社员），五路出兵（农村、工矿、学校、机关、部队）的办法，大办以小型为主的养猪场，充分挖掘了养猪潜力。财神公社集发管理区集乐小队，过去一头猪也没有，实行
  “五级动手”以后，社员们高兴地说，这回真好，食堂的米汤、细糠都可以拿来喂猪了，很快就养了五十六头猪，平均每户达到两头以上。目前，全县集体养猪四十三万多头中，由生产队和生产小队养的猪达三十七万多头。
    在发展养猪事业中，赫章县党组织加强了对这一工作的领导。县委和公社党委都设有畜牧部，专门配备了主管养猪事业的书记、部长，管理区和生产队也确定了一个副书记专管养猪。全县各级党的组织都把养猪事业提到经常议事日程上来，定期研究布置工作，随时督促检查。各级领导都亲自办养猪“试验田”，深入猪场劳动，一发现问题，及时解决。同时还发动群众大力开辟饲料基地，充分利用野生饲料，大抓饲料的采集和贮藏工作。今年上半年全县仅夏收中就收集了各种农副产品饲料三千多万斤。（附图片）
