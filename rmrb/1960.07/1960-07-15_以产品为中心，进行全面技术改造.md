Conduct comprehensive technical transformation centered on products

Peng Chong, First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

	The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Nanjing has achieved tremendous success in just a few months. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has increased by more than 20%. Production has increased significantly. The industrial output value in the first half of this year is equivalent to the total industrial output value of last year. The output of most major products in the first half of the year has completed more than half of the annual plan. Through this period of practice, we have further recognized the development trend of the technical revolution movement and found the correct method to carry out this movement. This is: taking the goal of producing products in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically as the target, organizing production lines, vigorously promoting mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, vigorously launching product revolutions, technological revolutions, and management revolutions, and carrying out comprehensive technical transformation of enterprises. The result of doing so is that the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees can be organized under a correct and clear goal, so that the technical revolution and the current production tasks can be integrated, and production and science and technology can develop more, faster, better, and more economically.

(I)

	In February of this year, based on the experience of some factories, we put forward the slogan of working around products, working in lines, working in areas, and working in sets. And through on-site meetings, visits, technical revolution sports meets and other methods, we exchanged experiences, complemented each other, gradually developed, and gradually improved. During this period, many factories in the city, starting from their own actual conditions, adopted a variety of practices around their products. For example, the Huadong Electron Tube Factory took the main product, fluorescent lamps, as the object, adjusted the original equipment layout, converted some equipment to automation and semi-automation, and added some auxiliary equipment to form a continuous production line. As a result, the daily output of fluorescent lamps increased by 30%. Some factories have reformed production methods more broadly. The freight car production of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory was originally scattered in twelve places, and the process route was very unreasonable. This time, they concentrated their efforts to thoroughly adjust the workshops, equipment, and production organization, and at the same time, they innovated some processes, realizing large-scale assembly line operation of freight car production. In the 200-meter-long workshop, materials enter at one end and cars come out at the other. This approach is a new development compared to the Huadong Electron Tube Factory, so it has achieved greater results in production. The production capacity of freight cars has increased by nearly doubled in the short three months from February to May.

	The practice of Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory is even more thorough. They used indigenous methods to independently design and manufacture a complete set of special combined high-efficiency equipment to form eight production lines (workers call this "eight dragons soaring to the sky") to process the eight parts of the lathe, abandon the old production methods, and create new production methods. In terms of technology, milling is used instead of planing, grinding is used instead of scraping, and multi-tool is used instead of single-tool, changing multiple processes into one process; in terms of equipment, high-efficiency special machine tools are used instead of general-purpose machine tools, and single machine tools are changed into combined machine tools; in terms of production organization, one workshop production is used instead of cross-workshop production, and batch intermittent production is changed into continuous and balanced production, thereby increasing production capacity by more than two times.

	Although these factories' reforms in methods belong to the reform of production methods (including the reform of technology, tools, equipment and labor organization, etc.), they have not touched the products themselves. Other factories are different. In the technical transformation around products, they quickly pointed the main spearhead at the products themselves and carried out a major product revolution. The Nanjing Machine Tool Factory used only one month to carry out a "complete transformation" of one of its main old products, the hexagonal automatic lathe, achieving: three savings (saving labor, saving materials, saving money), three highs (high efficiency, high degree of standardization, high degree of generalization), and three conveniences (convenient to obtain materials, convenient to manufacture, convenient to use). This product broke the original series boundaries of products and created a uniquely styled Chinese-style automatic lathe series.

	Now, some factories in the city are actively carrying out a major product revolution on the basis of the technological revolution, while other factories are further carrying out a technological revolution on the basis of the major product revolution. It seems that this is very necessary. Because, taking products as the center and carrying out technical transformation, no matter where you start, it will develop into a comprehensive transformation of enterprise production and technology. At the same time, only by closely combining the product revolution and the technological revolution, and correspondingly carrying out a revolution in enterprise management, can we carry out a comprehensive transformation of the enterprise, and can we closely combine the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" with current production to obtain the greatest effect.

(II)

	As of the end of June, 249 kinds of old products in the city have undergone varying degrees of technical transformation in product design, technology, equipment, and production organization, and 89 kinds are currently being transformed. The broad masses of cadres and people are very welcome to this approach. It has the following advantages.

	First, it meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. The common result of carrying out comprehensive technical transformation centered on products is "saving labor and materials, high production efficiency, high quality and low cost, and doubling output." After the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory's C618 lathe underwent this technological and equipment revolution, the number of workers was reduced by half, while the production capacity increased by more than two times. In the past, it took at least four hours to plane a lathe bed with a gantry planer, but now it takes only 40 minutes to process the plane of 22 lathe beds at a time; in the past, it took 17 processes to process a lathe bed, across four workshops, and the cycle took 15 days, but now it takes only 140 minutes in one workshop, through six processes; in the past, the area occupied by large-scale processing equipment was 700 square meters, but now it only needs more than 200 square meters; in the past, it took four technicians and one apprentice to watch a gantry planer, but now using combined lathes for production, the process is relatively simple and easy to master, and an ordinary worker can watch two machine tools as long as the old worker adjusts the milling cutter. Through the product revolution, many products have become smaller, lighter, simpler, and more efficient. Compared with the old hexagonal automatic lathe, the C1416 new automatic lathe created by the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory has improved its performance, and the spindle speed has increased from 4,000 revolutions per minute to 6,300 revolutions per minute, which has improved production efficiency. The total number of parts has been reduced by 44%, the weight of the machine tool has been reduced from one ton to half a ton; the consumption of steel materials has been reduced from 408 kg per unit to 212 kg; the amount of mechanical processing has been reduced by 56%, which can save 150,000 man-hours of labor per year; and the cost has been reduced by half. After the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory reformed the structure of the pocket multimeter, the number of parts was reduced from 139 to 82, which not only saved 40% of raw materials (non-ferrous metals), but also improved the quality. The equal strain dynamometer produced by the Soil Instrument Factory originally weighed 278 kg, but now it has been reduced to 10 kg, and its performance has been improved. Such examples are common in the product revolution.

	Second, it is easy to better consolidate, promote, and improve the results of the technical revolution. Producing products is the center of all activities of an enterprise, and the technical revolution takes the goal of producing products in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically as the center, so it has a clear struggle goal, and it can be closely combined with the current production and integrated into one. In this way, the weak links in the product production process will inevitably become the main direction of the technical revolution; and all the results of the technical revolution will inevitably be fully reflected in production and become an indispensable factor in the entire production process. Any new technology and new process are developed from practice. At the same time, only in continuous practice can they be consolidated, promoted, and improved. When new technologies and new processes are incorporated into the entire production process and become an indispensable part of it, a "only forward, no backward" compelling situation is formed, which is very beneficial to the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of new technologies and new processes. For example, the eight production lines organized by the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory also had some defects at the beginning. However, since the original machine tools of the entire workshop have all been moved, and the processing of the bed of the C618 machine tool completely relies on these new equipment, no one considers going back to the old road, but concentrates on solving the weak links in production. In less than a month, the factory has smoothly passed more than 200 machine tool beds on these eight production lines, so that these new equipment has been continuously improved and perfected in production practice.

	Third, it has driven the great revolution in enterprise management. Organizing production lines centered on products and carrying out comprehensive technical transformation not only greatly improves production capacity, but also further changes the interrelationships between people in production. In the past, since a large number of parts and components flowed in various workshops, many professionals were required to carry out frequent scheduling work. This is like a doctor prescribing Chinese medicine - "catching and dispensing on the spot," which is very laborious. Even so, the leadership often has no idea in mind, and some problems often have to wait until they "pile up" before they can be discovered. This situation affects the effect of workers participating in management. After the production line is organized, the situation has changed greatly, making the upper and lower processes closely connected, and the workers also directly join hands in production; the entire production situation is clear at a glance. This is greatly conducive to workers participating in management and to giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of workers in production; on the other hand, the establishment of production lines and the rapid development of the technical revolution movement have also put forward higher requirements for enterprise management work, which forces management work to be more and more detailed and to have a high degree of combat effectiveness, accuracy, mass character, and a high degree of communist cooperative spirit to meet the needs of the great leap forward in production.

	Fourth, it creates more favorable conditions for accelerating the development of science and technology and marching towards high, precision, and cutting-edge technology. The process of transforming old products is actually the process of marching towards high, precision, cutting-edge, and new technology. After the design of some old products has been thoroughly reformed, they have been completely transformed and have become uniquely styled new products. For example, the thermoelectric Q meter produced by the Gulou Telecommunications Instrument Factory has undergone three revolutions, and more than 190 parts have been removed. Recently, they have carried out a "bottom-up revolution" and removed the part on the instrument that is generally considered indispensable, which workers call Chinese-style. Some factories design, manufacture, and use their own special, high-efficiency combined equipment, which are themselves high-level and new products. Moreover, after using these new equipment, they can free up a batch of general-purpose equipment and technical forces to strengthen scientific research and trial production of new products. The Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory "liberated" more than 200 general-purpose equipment and a large number of technical workers after "eight dragons soared to the sky." Recently, they have successfully trial-produced three kinds of precision new gear machine tools and have begun mass production. Many units have also organized various forms of "three combinations" in the process of transforming old products and have put forward the slogan of "everyone is a designer, everyone is a process engineer," which has greatly strengthened mass scientific research activities.

	Fifth, taking product-centered technical transformation not only finds a way to comprehensively transform enterprises in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically, but also provides a new model for the construction of new enterprises. Taking the machine industry as an example, in the past, to build a new factory with an annual output of 3,000 machine tools, a large amount of investment, a large amount of equipment, a lot of technical force, and a considerable amount of design and construction time were required. However, the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory completed the national plan and used only three months and spent only more than 200,000 yuan to independently design and manufacture a set of new equipment with an annual output of 3,000 C618 lathes, which is equivalent to building a new medium-sized machine tool factory. Therefore, it can be imagined that in the future, the capital construction of new factories, except for the key projects of the state, generally speaking, the scale can be smaller at the beginning, first concentrating efforts to master the products and put them into production, and then producing and building at the same time, using indigenous methods to manufacture special high-efficiency combined equipment to arm themselves and expand production capacity. This "supporting the war with war" approach is very beneficial to socialist construction in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically.

(III)

	The process of carrying out comprehensive technical transformation centered on products is also a process full of sharp ideological struggles. During this period, various factories and mines in the city held various "ideal meetings" to continuously liberate their minds, break superstitions, and concentratedly criticize the "Jia Gui thought" of daring not to make revolution and the "Zhao Taiye style" of not allowing revolution. Taking the product revolution as an example, some people regard the original design as the golden rule and dare not move the earth on the head of Tai Sui. However, the broad masses of workers have realized in production practice that the design of some products cannot completely suit the actual situation in our country, especially the products designed by some capitalist countries, which have a "foreign style," "grandeur," and "delicacy," and are often complex in structure, bloated and huge, labor-intensive and material-consuming, and inconvenient to use. This kind of product especially must be revolutionized. In this product revolution, many new creations are the product of the workers' courage to think and dare to do. The story of the Gulou Telecommunications Instrument Factory's reform of the heterodyne frequency meter is a good example. This small factory used to borrow a heterodyne frequency meter from a large factory to calibrate its products. Recently, this large factory took back this instrument due to production needs. The Gulou Telecommunications Instrument Factory requested them to help them manufacture one, but a technician from this large factory said: "You can't handle such complicated things." This small factory was not discouraged and decided to mobilize the masses to design and manufacture it themselves. After more than a month of tenacious efforts and repeated experiments, they indeed built a heterodyne frequency meter. It is not only novel in structure and excellent in performance, but also saves materials and is easy to manufacture, completely breaking away from the old frame of the original design.

	In the great revolution of technology and equipment, various factories have also encountered many ideological obstacles. The Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory's "eight dragons soaring to the sky" went through a very sharp struggle with several ups and downs. As early as 1958, the factory's employees had independently designed and manufactured a combined gantry milling machine for processing the bed. However, this new thing was not able to grow smoothly and was beaten into the "cold palace" by a small number of leaders who advocated reaching out to ask for "foreign" equipment. After the anti-rightist struggle began in August 1959, the factory's employees posted tens of thousands of big-character posters, severely criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of a small number of leading cadres, and the combined gantry milling machine that had been beaten into the "cold palace" was restored to its reputation. This year, the factory's machine tool task has to be doubled and tripled, and the contradiction that large-scale processing cannot keep up with production needs is even more prominent. In order to solve this key problem, the factory's Party committee held a large-scale "ideal meeting," requiring everyone to follow the path of the combined gantry milling machine and boldly conceive, and as a result, a revolutionary plan for "eight dragons soaring to the sky" was discussed. In the process of establishing these eight dragons, the factory's employees used a thorough revolutionary spirit to overcome the fear of difficulties of a small number of people, and with a firm attitude of starting with indigenous methods and relying on their own efforts, they overcame the lazy thinking of a small number of people who reached out and waited. In order to show their determination to win, under the slogan of "everything for the eight dragons soaring to the sky," the factory launched a self-reliance revolutionary upsurge of "drawing their own drawings without drawings, finding their own materials without materials, assembling their own equipment without equipment, squeezing their own time without time, and creating their own experience without experience." Many cadres and the masses worked in the workshop, ate in the workshop, and slept in the workshop. In this way, the top and bottom were united and worked together, and after more than two months of hard work, a complete set of new equipment was created. Now, this factory has concentrated the opinions of the masses and formulated a technical revolution plan for fighting five battles throughout the year, and is determined to realize the great ideal of "entering ore through the front door and exiting machine tools through the back door."

	Practice fully shows that to produce products in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically, we must first establish the guiding ideology of building socialism in greater quantity, faster, better, and more economically. We must not only dare to make revolution, but also continuously make revolution and thoroughly make revolution. As some employees sing: "Beyond the mountains are green mountains, beyond the buildings are buildings, heroes are constantly striving to be upstream, the revolution is endless, and there is no end to the liberation of the mind." We believe that in socialist construction, the primary sign to measure whether a cadre has revolutionary will is to see whether he has the ambition of the proletariat and the determination to implement the policy of self-reliance. The work of carrying out comprehensive technical transformation centered on products is also the same. Wherever there is the ambition of the proletariat, and the masses are fully mobilized to carry out their own design, manufacture, and use self-reliantly, the movement is carried out vigorously and effectively; wherever they believe in "foreign" equipment and reach out to wait, the movement must be cold and quiet, with few gains.

	To carry out technical transformation of enterprises, we also need to have correct working methods. On the one hand, we need to have a high-standard and comprehensive plan centered on products, and at the same time, we must seize the main keys in each period, concentrate superior forces, adopt a variety of three-combination methods, and organize assaults from one battle to another. For example, in the product revolution, some factories first lined up the products of the entire factory, selected representative products, and concentrated their efforts to carry out assaults. In this way, as long as one product reform is successful, it will lead to the reform of the entire series of products.

    以产品为中心，进行全面技术改造
　　中共南京市委第一书记　彭冲
      南京市的技术革新和技术革命运动在短短的几个月
  内，已经取得了十分巨大的成就，全市机械化、半机械化程度提高了20％以上。生产有了大幅度的增长，今年上半年的工业产值相当于去年全年的工业总产值，上半年绝大部分主要产品的产量，已经完成全年计划的一半以上。通过这一时期的实践，我们进一步认清了技术革命运动的发展趋势，找到了开展这一运动的正确方法。这就是：以多快好省地生产产品为目标，组织生产流水线，大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，大闹产品革命、工艺革命和管理革命，对企业进行全面的技术改造。这样做的结果，就可以把广大职工的积极性和创造性，在一个正确的鲜明的目标下组织起来，使技术革命和当前生产任务拧成一体，使生产和科学技术能够更多快好省地发展。
                        （一）
    今年2月间，我们根据一部分工厂的经验，提出了围绕产品，成线地干、成片地干、成套地干的口号。并且通过现场会议、参观访问、技术革命运动会等各种方式，交流经验，互相补充，逐步发展，逐步提高。在这个期间，全市不少工厂都围绕自己的产品，从自己的实际情况出发，采取了多种多样的做法。例如，华东电子管厂是以主要产品萤光灯为对象，调整了原有的设备布置，将部分设备改为自动化、半自动化，并增加了部分辅助设备，组成了一条连续生产的流水线，结果使萤光灯的日产量提高了30％。有些工厂改革生产方法的面则更广。浦镇车辆工厂的货车生产，原来分散在十二个地方，工艺路线很不合理。这次他们集中力量，彻底调整了车间、设备和生产组织，同时革新了一部分工艺，实现了货车生产的大流水作业，在全长二百米的车间中，一头进料，一头出车。这种作法比华东电子管厂有了新的发展，因此，在生产上也得到了更大的效果，货车的生产能力在2月到5月这短短三个月之内，增加了将近一倍。
    南京第二机床厂的做法就更彻底。他们用土办法自行设计和制造了一整套专用的组合的高效率设备，组成八条生产流水线（工人把这叫做“八龙上天”），加工车床的八个部件，抛弃了旧的生产方法，创造了新的生产方法。在工艺上，以铣代鉋，以磨代刮，以多刀代单刀，变多道工序为一道工序；在设备上，以高效率的专用机床代替通用机床，变单一机床为组合机床；在生产组织上，以一个车间生产代替跨车间生产，变分批间断的生产为连续均衡的生产，从而使生产能力提高了两倍以上。
    这些工厂，虽然在做法上都是属于生产方法上的改革
  （包括工艺、工具、设备和劳动组织的改革等），但对于产品本身却没有触动。另外一些工厂就不同了，他们在环绕产品进行技术改造中，很快就把主要矛头指向产品本身，进行了产品大革命。南京机床厂只用了一个月的时间，就将主要老产品之一的六角自动车床进行了“脱胎换骨”的改造，做到了：三省（省工、省料、省钱）、三高（效率高、标准化程度高、通用化程度高）、三方便（取材方便、制造方便、使用方便）。这种产品打破了原有产品的系列界限，创造了别具风格的中国式的自动车床系列。
    现在，全市一部分工厂正在工艺大革命的基础上积极进行产品大革命，而另一部分工厂则在产品大革命的基础上，进一步开展工艺大革命。看来，这是十分必要的。因为，以产品为中心，进行技术改造，不论从哪一方面入手，都会发展到对企业生产和技术的全面改造。同时，也只有将产品革命和工艺革命密切结合起来，并相应地进行企业管理上的革命，才能对企业进行全面的改造，才能使以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动与当前生产紧密结合起来，获得最大的效果。
                        （二）
    全市截至6月底，已经有二百四十九种老产品在产品设计、工艺、设备、生产组织等方面进行了程度不同的技术改造，目前正在改造的还有八十九种。广大干部群众对于这种做法是非常欢迎的。它有以下几个方面的好处。
    第一，符合多快好省的要求。以产品为中心，进行全面技术改造的共同结果，“省工又省料，生产效率高，优质低成本，产量成倍跃”。南京第二机床厂的C618车床，经过这次工艺、设备大革命以后，工人减少一半，而生产能力却提高了两倍以上。过去用龙门鉋刨一台床身最快也要四小时，现在一次加工好二十二个床身的平面，只用四十分钟；过去加工一台床身要经过十七道工序，跨四个车间，周期需要十五天，现在在一个车间里，经过六道工序，总共只要一百四十分钟；过去大件加工设备的占地面积为七百平方米，现在只要二百多平方米；过去看一台龙门鉋需要四个技工和一个徒工，现在用组合车床生产，工艺比较简单，容易掌握，只要老工人把铣刀调整好，一个普通工人就可以看两台机床。通过产品革命，使不少产品由大变小、由重变轻、由复杂变简单、由低效变高效。南京机床厂创制的C1416新型自动车床和老产品六角自动车床比较，使用性能有了改进，主轴转速由每分钟四千转提高到六千三百转，提高了生产效率。而零件总数却减少了44％，机床重量由一吨减少到半吨；钢料消耗由每台四百零八公斤减少到二百十二公斤；机械加工工作量减少56％，全年可节约劳动量十五万工时；成本降低一半。南京教学仪器厂改革了袖珍万用电表的结构之后，零件从一百三十九个减到八十二个，不但节约原材料（有色金属）40％，而且质量也有了提高。土壤仪器厂生产的等应变箭力仪，原来重达二百七十八公斤，现在减到十公斤，性能反而提高了。这样的例子，在产品革命中是屡见不鲜的。
    第二，便于更好地巩固、推广和提高技术革命的成果。生产产品是企业一切活动的中心，而技术革命以多快好省地生产产品为中心，就有了鲜明的奋斗目标，就可以和当前生产紧密结合，拧成一体。这样，产品生产过程中的薄弱环节，必然会成为技术革命的主攻方向；而技术革命的一切成果，也必然会充分地反映到生产上来，成为整个生产过程中必不可少的因素。任何新技术、新工艺都是从实践中发展起来的。同时，也只有在不断实践中，才能得到巩固、推广和提高。当新技术和新工艺纳入了整个生产过程，成为它的必不可少的一部分以后，也就形成了一种
  “只能前进，不能后退”的逼人形势，对于新技术、新工艺的巩固、推广和提高非常有利。例如，南京第二机床厂组织的八条生产流水线，开始也存在一些缺陷。但是，既然原有整个车间的机床已经全部搬家，加工C618机床的床身完全依靠这些新的设备，因此谁也不考虑再走回头路了，而是一心一意地去解决生产中的薄弱环节。在不到一个月的时间内，全厂在这八条生产流水线上，已经畅行无阻地通过了二百多台机床床身，从而使这些新的设备在生产实践上得到了不断的改进和完善。
    第三，带动了企业管理的大革命。以产品为中心组织生产流水线，进行全面的技术改造，不仅大大提高了生产能力，而且也进一步改变了人们在生产中的相互关系。过去，由于大量的零件部件在各个车间流动，需要不少专业人员来进行频繁的调度工作。这好比医生配中药方——“现抓现配”，非常吃力。即使这样，领导上还常常心中无数，有些问题往往要等到“成堆”以后才能发现。这种状况，影响了工人参加管理的效果。在生产流水线组织起来以后，情况就起了很大的变化，使上、下道工序之间密切衔接，工人在生产中也直接携起手来；整个生产情况一目了然。这就大大有利于工人参加管理，有利于发挥工人在生产中的主动性和积极性；另一方面，生产流水线的建立和技术革命运动的迅速发展，也给企业管理工作提出了更高的要求，这就迫使管理工作必须越做越细，具有高度的战斗性、准确性、群众性和高度的共产主义协作精神，以适应生产大跃进的需要。
    第四，为加速发展科学技术向高、精、尖进军创造了更有利的条件。改造老产品的过程，实际上就是向高、精、尖、新进军的过程。有些老产品的设计经过彻底改革以后，已经脱胎换骨，成为独创的别具风格的新型产品。例如，鼓楼电讯仪表厂生产的热偶式Q表，经过三次革命，革掉了一百九十多个零件。最近，他们又来了一个“兜底革命”，把仪表上的这个一般人认为必不可缺少的部件，也革掉了，工人称它为中国式了。有些工厂自己设计、自己制造、自己使用的那些专用的、高效的组合设备，本身就是高级、新型的产品。而且在使用这些新设备以后，还可以腾出一批通用设备和技术力量来加强科学研究和试制新产品。南京第二机床厂在“八龙上天”之后就“解放”了二百多台通用设备和大批技术工人。最近他们已经试制成功了三种精密的新型齿轮机床，并开始了成批生产。许多单位在改造老产品的过程中，还组织了多种形式的“三结合”，提出了“人人当设计师，人人当工艺员”的口号，大大加强了群众性的科学研究活动。
    第五，以产品为中心进行技术改造，不仅为企业的全面改造找到了一条多快好省的道路，也为新企业的建设提供了新的样板。以机器工业来说，过去要建设一个年产三千台机床的新厂，需要大批投资、大量设备，很多技术力量和相当长的设计和建设时间。但是，南京第二机床厂在完成国家计划的同时，只用了三个月的时间，只花了二十多万元，就自行设计和制造了一套年产C618车床三千台的新型设备，等于新建了一个中型机床厂。因此，可以设想，今后搞新厂的基本建设，除了国家的重点项目之外，一般说，在开始的时候规模可以小一些，首先集中力量掌握产品、投入生产，然后一面生产、一面建设，用土办法制造专用的高效的组合的设备来武装自己、扩大生产能力。这种“以战养战”的做法，对于多快好省地进行社会主义建设，是非常有利的。
                          （三）
    以产品为中心进行全面的技术改造的过程，也是充满着尖锐的思想斗争的过程。在这个期间，全市各个厂矿都举行了各种各样的“理想会”，不断地解放思想，破除迷信，集中地批判了不敢革命的“贾桂思想”和不准革命的
  “赵太爷作风”。拿产品革命来说，有一些人把原有的设计奉为金科玉律，不敢在太岁头上动土。但是，广大职工却在生产实践中体会到，有些产品的设计，并不能完全适合我国的实际情况，特别是有些资本主义国家设计的产品，更有一股子“洋气”、“阔气”和“娇气”，往往结构复杂、臃肿庞大、花工费料、使用不便。这种产品尤其是非进行革命不可。在这次产品革命中，有很多新的创造，都是工人群众敢想敢干的产物。鼓楼电讯仪表厂改革外差式频率表的故事，就是一个很好的例子。这个小厂过去向一个大厂借了一架外差式频率表，靠它校验产品。最近这个大厂由于生产需要把这架仪表收回去了。鼓楼电讯仪表厂就请求他们帮助自己制造一架，但是这个大厂有一位技术人员却说：“这样复杂的东西，你们搞不了”。这个小厂却不气馁，决心发动群众，自己设计、自己制造，经过一个多月的顽强努力，反复试验，果然造出了一架外差式频率表。它不但结构新颖，性能良好，而且用料节省，容易制造，完全跳出了原有设计的老框子。
    在进行工艺、设备的大革命中，各个工厂也遇到了很多思想阻碍。南京第二机床厂的“八龙上天”，就经过了一场几起几伏十分尖锐的斗争。早在1958年，该厂职工就曾经自行设计制造了一台加工床身的组合龙门铣床。但是这个新生事物没有能够顺利地成长起来，而被少数主张向上伸手要“洋”设备的领导人一棍子打入了“冷宫”。1959年8月反右倾斗争开始以后，全厂职工贴出了成千上万张大字报，狠狠批判了少数领导干部的右倾保守思想，那台被打入了“冷宫”的组合龙门铣床才恢复了名誉。今年这个厂的机床任务要成倍加番，大件加工跟不上生产需要的矛盾更加突出。为解决这个关键，厂党委召开了一次大型“理想会”，要求大家顺着组合龙门铣床的路子，大胆设想，结果议出一个“八龙上天”的革命方案。在建立这八条龙的过程中，全厂职工用彻底的革命精神战胜了少数人的畏难情绪，以土法上马、自力更生的坚定态度，战胜了少数人伸手等待的懒汉思想。为了显示必胜的决心，在“一切为了八龙上天”的口号下，全厂掀起了一个“没有图纸自己画，没有材料自己找，没有设备自己凑，没有时间自己挤，没有经验自己创”的自力更生闹革命的热潮。很多干部与群众干在车间、吃在车间、睡在车间。就这样上下一心，共同努力，经过两个多月的奋战，造出了一整套新型的设备。现在，这个工厂已经集中群众的意见，订出了全年打好五个战役的技术革命规划，并决心实现“前门进矿石，后门出机床”的伟大理想。
    实践充分说明，要以多快好省的方法生产产品，首先要确立多快好省地建设社会主义的指导思想。不仅要敢于革命，而且要不断革命、彻底革命。正如有些职工所唱的：“山外青山楼外楼，英雄不断争上游，革命永世无止境，思想解放那有头”。我们认为，在社会主义建设中，衡量一个干部有没有革命意志的首要标志，就是要看他有没有无产阶级的雄心壮志和坚决贯彻执行自力更生的方针。以产品为中心进行全面技术改造的工作，也是如此。凡是具有无产阶级的雄心壮志，又充分发动群众，自力更生地进行自己设计、自己制造、自己使用的地方，运动就开展得轰轰烈烈，成效显著；凡是迷信“洋”设备、伸手等待的地方，运动必然是冷冷清清，少有收获。
    对企业进行技术改造，还需要有正确的工作方法。一方面要有一个以产品为中心的高标准的全面的规划，同时也要抓住每一个时期的主要关键，集中优势兵力，采用多种三结合的方法，一个战役又一个战役地组织突击。例如，在产品革命中，有些工厂首先对全厂的产品进行了排队，选择具有代表性的产品，集中力量进行突击。这样，只要一项产品改革成功，就一通百通，带动了整个系列产品的改革。
