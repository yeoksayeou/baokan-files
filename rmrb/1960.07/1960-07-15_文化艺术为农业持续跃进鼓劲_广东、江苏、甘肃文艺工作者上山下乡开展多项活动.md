　　Cultural Arts Boost Continued Agricultural Leap Forward
　　Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Gansu Literary and Art Workers Go to the Countryside to Carry Out Various Activities

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the broad masses of cultural and art workers in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City are supporting agriculture with practical actions.

    Writers, playwrights, musicians, and artists from the province and city have gone deep into the countryside to participate in production, actively creating works reflecting agricultural production and all aspects of support for agriculture, and helping rural areas carry out cultural and recreational activities.

  Drama workers have also been dispatched to the front lines of agricultural production. The Guangzhou Peking Opera Troupe, which has always been praised for its dedication to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, has already gone to the Shantou area to perform for the farmers in this region who are bravely fighting against drought and flood disasters. The Guangdong Cantonese Opera Theater has unified a troupe, a performing team, and an actor training class currently stationed in Guangzhou into two capable performing teams, which have been taking turns going to the Foshan area and the Dongjiang area people's communes for labor and performances since the 8th.

    A group of musicians will be divided into three groups to go to Jiangmen, Foshan, the suburbs of Guangzhou, and other places to collect materials, write new songs about industry supporting agriculture, and the cadres remaining in the agencies will also work together to rush to write lyrics, compile music, and write articles, using music to praise the good people and good deeds of all aspects of support for agriculture. The actors of the Guangdong Folk Music and Quyi Troupe have recently also hooked up with two communes in the near suburbs of Guangzhou and signed long-term tutoring contracts.

    Fine arts and film workers are also creating a batch of fine art works and films with the theme of supporting agriculture.

    This newspaper reports that cultural departments such as drama, film, and books in Jiangsu Province are facing the countryside and actively serving agricultural production.

    There are nearly seven hundred film projection teams in Jiangsu Province, including more than four hundred and eighty rural projection teams. From January to May this year, rural projection teams showed more than 120,000 films, with an audience of more than 100 million people. Film projection points have been basically established in the brigades of various people's communes, and films can be seen once or twice a month. The characteristic of this year's film content is that science and technology films and short films directly reflecting rural production account for the vast majority, such as forty-eight films such as "Thousands of Miles of Wheat Fragrance Urging People to be Busy," "Tool Reform," and "Innovation Flowers Blooming Everywhere," all of which have achieved coordination with agricultural seasons and are widely shown. They directly train technicians such as electricians, telephone operators, and farm tool repairmen for the commune to meet the needs of rural technical transformation.

    This year, the cultural departments of Jiangsu Province have made overall arrangements in terms of funding and manpower in establishing rural cultural centers and stations and carrying out rural amateur cultural activities, helping communes actively train cadres of cultural centers and stations, improving the organization of cultural centers (stations), and carrying out various cultural activities serving production in a timely manner in combination with all aspects of agricultural seasons.

    This year, professional drama troupes at all levels in Jiangsu Province have also performed in the countryside more often than in previous years. The Provincial Peking Opera Theater, the Provincial Yang Opera Theater, and the professional drama troupes of various regions have successively made longer tours in the countryside, which have been generally welcomed by the peasants.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, cultural and art workers in Gansu Province have gone deep into the countryside and used various propaganda weapons to vigorously support the agricultural front.

    Professional performing arts groups throughout the province went to the mountains and the countryside to perform in the fields. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two troupes in the province, more than 1,600 performances have been given in various people's communes and water conservancy construction sites since the first half of the year, with an audience of 980,000 people. In the process of performing in the mountains and the countryside, professional drama troupes also actively participated in agricultural labor and guided the communes to carry out mass amateur drama activities.

    Since the vigorous anti-drought production activities were launched this spring, the Lanzhou Film Studio has filmed news documentaries such as "Fighting the Drought Demon." Film distribution units have also planned to organize the distribution of relevant films such as "Land So Rich in Beauty," "Songs on the Reservoir," "Mountain Canal," and "People's Commune Fighting Drought" for screening in rural areas.

    Local cultural organizations have also actively carried out activities in anti-drought production and agricultural technology transformation. The Gansu Provincial Museum has successively held seven picture and material exhibitions with the theme of agricultural technology transformation and anti-drought production, with an audience of more than 270,000 people.

    The museum's mobile anti-drought exhibition and propaganda team has also carried out activities in more than ten counties and cities including Pingliang and Qingyang. The province's book distribution units serve agricultural technology transformation, distribute books introducing relevant agriculture in various ways, and assist communes in establishing more than 2,000 brigade libraries and canteen libraries.

    At present, a new upsurge in cultural activities supporting agriculture has been set off throughout the province. Various cultural and art groups are focusing on mass cultural activities in rural areas and vigorously promoting forms such as puppets, slides, shadow puppets, and Quyi to publicize the importance of developing agriculture.

    一批音乐家将分成三组到江门、佛山和广州郊区等地搜集材料、写作工业支援农业的新歌，留在机关的干部也一齐动手在赶写歌词、编制曲谱、撰写文章，用音乐歌颂各方面支援农业的好人好事。广东民间音乐曲艺团的演员们最近还和广州近郊两个公社挂上了钩，订了长期辅导的合同。

    从今春大力展开抗旱生产活动以来，兰州电影制片厂已拍摄了“奋战旱魔”等新闻纪录片。影片发行单位，也有计划地组织发行了“江山多娇”、“水库上的歌声”、“山上运河”、“人民公社抗旱”等有关影片，在农村放映。
    各地文化组织在抗旱生产和农业技术改造中，也积极开展活动。甘肃省博物馆先后进行了七次以农业技术改造和抗旱生产为内容的图片和实物展览，观众达二十七万多人次。
    这个馆的防旱抗旱流动展览宣传队，还先后到平凉、庆阳等十多个县市开展活动。全省图书发行单位为农业技术改造服务，用各种办法发行介绍有关农业的图书，并协助公社建立大队图书室、食堂图书室两千多个。
    目前，全省支援农业的文化活动掀起了新高潮。各文化艺术团体正在大抓农村群众文化活动，大力推广木偶、幻灯、皮影、曲艺等形式，宣传发展农业的重要性。
