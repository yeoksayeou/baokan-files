　　The important development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system, taking Qinghua Tool Factory as an example, is mainly reflected in: the scope of worker participation in management has been further expanded, the content has become richer, and the level of management has been greatly improved. Workers not only participate in the daily production management of the group, but also participate in the comprehensive management of planning, technology, cost, etc., and have established a relatively complete set of management systems and working methods. The group not only manages production, but also manages ideology, learning, and life, making the production group truly a strong level of administrative organization, and making worker participation in group management truly the foundation of the entire enterprise management work. In terms of cadres participating in labor, it has not only become a system that can be regularly adhered to, but has also established a new working system and working method that combines work, labor, and learning. In the reform of rules and regulations, focusing on the issues caused by the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," a relatively comprehensive, concentrated, and prudent reform has been carried out—from the reform of process regulations and operating procedures to the reform of labor organization and production organization, etc., so as to better adapt to and promote the development of the technical revolution. In the application of the three-combination method, both the form and content have new developments, and the scope of application has become wider, expanding from solving production technology problems to solving all aspects of enterprise management problems. This better combines politics and technology, leadership and the masses, and theory and practice. Due to the continuous consolidation, improvement, and development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system, the factory's management work has entered a new stage, and the production landscape and the mental outlook of employees have been completely renewed.
　　Practice has proven that the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system is a fundamental system for our party to lead and manage socialist enterprises. Because it fully conforms to the nature of socialist enterprises, it can fully demonstrate the superiority of socialist enterprises. Seriously implementing this system can continuously improve the work style of leading cadres, continuously improve the communist consciousness of the broad masses of employees, continuously adjust the internal production relations of enterprises, enhance the unity within the working class, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees to carry out vigorous mass movements. This completely changes the situation of running enterprises coldly and quietly by relying solely on a few people using top-down administrative orders and simple material incentives, thereby better implementing the party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and developing production at a Great Leap Forward speed.
　　The "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system can exert such great power because it is a revolution in enterprise management system and leadership method, and also a revolution in political ideology. Adhering to and continuously developing this system can consciously and proactively resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, caused by the rapid development of the productive forces. It can also correct ideologically and organizationally the influence and behavior of the one-sided factory director responsibility system that does not want party leadership, does not want putting politics in command, and does not want to engage in mass movements. With the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee and the employee representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party Committee, with putting politics in command and vigorously engaging in mass movements, and with the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system, we have formed a complete set of systems for leading and managing socialist enterprises. With this complete set of systems, we can ensure the absolute leadership of the Party over enterprises and fully implement the Party's policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, taking politics as the commander, closely integrating political work and economic work, closely integrating centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, and closely integrating professional management with mass management.
　　The "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system can exert such great power also because the continuous consolidation, improvement, and development of this system is always closely linked to the comprehensive improvement of the political and ideological level, professional and technical level, and cultural level of employees, promoting each other and improving together. Therefore, in the past two years, while implementing the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system, the political ideology, professional, and technical levels of the broad masses of employees have also been greatly improved. A strong contingent of the working class with high political awareness and a certain level of culture and technology, and a contingent of cadres who are both red and expert are rapidly growing and expanding on the industrial front of our province. Taking Qinghua Tool Factory as an example, 50% of the factory's worker-administrators have reached the level of similar professionals, and the vast majority of cadres can skillfully master one or more types of work and the operating techniques of three to five processes. Moreover, some workshops have begun to implement a system of regular rotation between workers and cadres. In this way, it not only prepares cadres and technical forces for the further development of socialist construction, but also creates conditions for realizing the intellectualization of workers and peasants, the laborization of intellectuals, and for gradually narrowing the gap between mental and manual labor, and for further transitioning to a communist society in the future.
　　Continuously consolidating, improving, and developing the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system must be closely combined with the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and closely combined with achieving substantial increases in production and establishing and consolidating the "new normal" of production. Because the important significance of this system lies in continuously adjusting the relations of production and the superstructure to adapt to and promote the needs of the further development of the productive forces. If we cannot reflect the unparalleled superiority of this system in production, then we have lost our direction. Therefore, whether or not we can establish and consolidate the "new normal" of production is an important sign to test the implementation of this system.
　　Continuously improving the leadership style is a basic condition for continuously consolidating, improving, and developing the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system. It is also an important component of the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system. If leaders cannot go deep into the reality of production, go deep among the masses, cannot treat people with an equal attitude, do not care about the thoughts and living conditions of the masses, and cannot share weal and woe with the masses, then even if there are good experiences and good systems, they cannot be well implemented. Therefore, starting from continuously improving the leadership style is the only way to adhere to and develop the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system.
　　Finally, and most importantly, is to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Party committees at all levels must use Chairman Mao's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people and the principle of combining continuous revolution with the theory of stages of revolutionary development to widely educate cadres and the masses. We must grasp "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" as vigorously as we grasp the technical revolution, and conduct management work sports meets in the same way as we conduct production sports meets. We must ideologically and organizationally ensure that the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system is further improved and developed in industrial enterprises throughout the province. We know that any good experience and good system have its own laws of development. Only through continuous practice and continuous summarization can it be continuously improved and continuously developed. The same is true for the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" system. We must firmly grasp this good experience and good system, persist in it, and continuously improve and develop it in practice, thereby continuously improving the management level of enterprises, continuously promoting the development of productive forces, and enabling the industrial production and construction of our province to continue to leap forward comprehensively and at high speed.

### 进一步贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”方针全面提高企业管理水平

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　进一步贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”方针全面提高企业管理水平 　 “两参一改三结合”制度的重要发展，以庆华工具厂为例，主要表现在：工人参加管理的范围更加扩大了，内容更加丰富了，管理的水平大大提高了。工人不仅参加了小组的日常生产管理，而且参加了计划、技术、成本等全面管理，并建立起一套比较完整的管理制度和工作方法。小组不仅管生产，而且管思想、学习和生活，使生产小组真正成为坚强的一级行政组织，使工人参加小组管理真正成为整个企业管理工作的基础。在干部参加劳动方面，不仅成为一种能够经常坚持的制度，而且已经建立起一套工作、劳动和学习相结合的新的工作制度和工作方法。在改革规章制度方面、围绕着以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动引起的问题，比较全面、集中而又慎重地进行了改革——从工艺规程、操作规程的改革，到劳动组织与生产组织的改革等等，从而更好地适应和促进了技术革命的发展。在三结合方法的运用方面，无论形式和内容都有新发展，运用的范围也更加广泛了，已经从解决生产技术问题扩展到解决企业管理的各方面问题。使政治和技术、领导和群众，理论与实践更好地结合起来。由于“两参一改三结合”制度的不断巩固、提高和发展，就使这个厂的管理工作，进入了一个新的阶段，使生产面貌和职工的精神面貌焕然一新。
    实践证明：“两参一改三结合”的制度，是我们党领导和管理社会主义企业的一项根本制度。由于它完全符合社会主义企业的性质，因而可以充分发挥社会主义企业的优越性。认真贯彻执行这一制度，就可以不断改进领导干部的工作作风，不断提高广大职工群众的共产主义觉悟，不断调整企业内部的生产关系，增强工人阶级内部的团结，充分调动广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动。这就完全改变了那种只靠少数人用自上而下的行政命令和单纯物质刺激、冷冷清清办企业的局面，从而可以更好地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，以大跃进的速度，发展生产事业。
    “两参一改三结合”制度之所以能够发挥如此巨大的威力，是因为它是企业管理制度和领导方法上的革命，也是政治思想上的革命。坚持与不断发展这一制度，就可以自觉地主动地解决由于生产力的飞跃发展所引起的生产关系与生产力之间、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，就能够在思想上、组织上纠正那种不要党的领导、不要政治挂帅、不要大搞群众运动的片面厂长负责制的影响和行为。有了党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会制，有了政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，再有了“两参一改三结合”的制度，这就形成了我们一整套领导和管理社会主义企业的制度。有了这一整套制度，就可以保证党对企业的绝对领导和充分贯彻执行党的依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针，以政治为统帅，把政治工作和经济工作密切结合起来，把集中领导与大搞群众运动密切结合起来，把专业管理与群众管理密切结合起来。
    “两参一改三结合”制度之所以能够发挥如此巨大的威力，还由于这一制度的不断巩固、提高和发展，始终是和职工群众的政治思想水平、业务、技术水平和文化水平的全面提高，密切联系，相互促进，共同提高的。因此，两年来，在贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”制度的同时，广大职工的政治思想、业务、技术水平也有了很大提高，我省工业战线上一支强大的、具有高度政治觉悟和具有一定文化、技术水平的工人阶级队伍和又红又专的干部队伍正在迅速地成长、壮大起来。以庆华工具厂为例，该厂有50％的工人管理员已经达到了同类专业人员的水平，绝大部分干部能熟练地掌握一个以上工种，三至五道工序的操作技术，而且有的车间已开始实行工人和干部定期轮换制。这样，就不仅为进一步发展社会主义建设事业准备了干部和技术力量，而且为实现工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化，为逐步缩小脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，为将来进一步过渡到共产主义社会创造了条件。
    不断巩固、提高、发展“两参一改三结合”制度，必须与当前的技术革新、技术革命运动密切结合起来，与实现大幅度增产、建立和巩固生产“新常规”密切结合起来。因为这一制度的重要意义，就在于不断调整生产关系和上层建筑，以适应和促进生产力的进一步发展的需要。如果我们不能从生产上反映出这一制度的无比优越性，那么，我们就是迷失了方向。因此，能否建立和巩固生产“新常规”，是检验这一制度贯彻的好坏的一个重要标志。
    不断改进领导作风，是不断巩固、提高、发展“两参一改三结合”制度的一个基本条件。也是“两参一改三结合”制度的重要组成部分。如果领导者不能深入生产实际，深入群众，不能以平等态度待人，不关心群众的思想和生活状况，不能和群众同甘共苦，那么，即使有了好经验、好制度，也不能很好地贯彻执行。因此，从不断改进领导作风入手，是坚持和发展“两参一改三结合”制度的必由之路。
    最后，也是最重要的一环，是加强党的领导。各级党委要用毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的学说和不断革命论与革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，广泛教育干部和群众，要像大抓技术革命一样，大抓“两参一改三结合”，用大搞生产运动会的办法，大搞管理工作运动会。从思想上、组织上保证“两参一改三结合”制度在全省工业企业中得到进一步的提高和发展。我们知道，任何好的经验和好的制度，都有它自身发展的规律。只有不断实践，不断总结，才能不断提高，不断发展。对“两参一改三结合”制度也不例外。我们要一口咬住这一好经验、好制度不放，坚持下去，并在实践中不断完善它、发展它，从而不断提高企业的管理水平，不断促进生产力的发展，使我省的工业生产建设，持续地、全面地、高速度地向前跃进。
