Mobilize Enthusiasm for Hog Raising in All Aspects
Shangrao Prefecture Vigorously Develops Hog Farms at Four Levels and Helps Commune Members Raise Hogs in Various Ways

(Our dispatch) Jiangxi Shangrao Prefecture, while vigorously developing collective hog raising, actively helps commune members develop private hog raising.

In the past, this prefecture often experienced slack hog production in the first half of the year and tight production in the second half due to busy farming seasons. An important reason for this was that some regions neglected the development of private hog raising while implementing the principle of "public raising as the mainstay, with both public and private raising." To address this, from the beginning of this year, the prefecture, while vigorously developing collective hog raising led by production teams, actively helped commune members develop private hog raising. Hog production in the entire prefecture has seen a substantial increase. By the end of June, the number of hogs raised reached 2,277,000, exceeding the first half of the year's production target by more than 220,000, and increasing by more than double compared to the same period last year. The number of hogs in stock reached 1,707,000, an increase of 71.7% compared to the same period last year. Collective hog raising in the entire region increased from 30% in the past to over 60%, while the number of private hog-raising households reached over 90% of the total number of households.

The high-speed development of hog production in Shangrao Prefecture is the result of implementing the principle of putting politics in command and effectively strengthening leadership over hog production. The prefecture, counties, communes, brigades, and production teams have all established leading bodies for hog production, headed by secretaries at all levels, with one secretary specifically responsible. Party members and Youth League members account for over 10% of the more than 54,000-member hog-raising professional teams in the region. In developing collective hog production, all localities have fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes and launched a "four-level farm construction" movement involving counties, communes, brigades, and production teams. The number of collective hog farms in the prefecture, counties, communes, brigades, production teams, and other units has rapidly increased from more than 10,000 last year to more than 27,000. In accelerating production, all localities have firmly focused on breeding, feed, and disease prevention. All hog farms have placed sow production as a top priority, adopting the method of "keeping all sows seen, keeping first and selecting later" to increase the number of sows by more than 570,000, completing 105.6% of the annual target.

In terms of feed, all farms have established feed bases, organized land reclamation, and vigorously utilized scattered land, so that each hog has an average of 0.12 mu of feed land. In addition, aquatic feed is grown in mountain ponds and reservoirs, and during the season of lush foliage, the masses are organized to collect wild feed, thereby ensuring the need for feed. In terms of disease prevention, veterinary institutions have been established in counties, communes, brigades, and production teams, forming a disease prevention and health network that effectively prevents diseases.

Implementing the principle of grasping both public and private raising, with public raising leading private raising, Shangrao Prefecture has taken many measures to help commune members develop private hog raising. Party committees at all levels have made practical arrangements for the issues raised by some people regarding piglets, funds, feed, and time. The source of pigs is supplied by collective hog farms. For commune members who are temporarily unable to pay, measures such as issuing hog-raising pre-purchase deposits, installment payments, paying after raising, and repaying the principal without interest when selling pigs are adopted to support hog raising. From January to June of this year, the region supplied more than 240,000 piglets to the masses. Regarding the feed problem, in addition to an average of 0.12 mu of feed land per hog, 30 jin of refined feed is supplied for each hog raised, in addition to the private plots. In terms of feeding time, in addition to the surplus time after completing the contracted tasks being at the disposal of the commune members, they have three days a month to engage in firewood gathering and feed preparation. The reasonable resolution of various problems has stimulated the enthusiasm of commune members for hog raising, forming a mass movement in which everyone participates and every household raises pigs. Now more than 90% of households in the region raise pigs. (Attached picture)

　　把各方面的养猪积极性调动起来
　　上饶专区在大搞四级办猪场，并多方帮助社员养猪
    本报讯　江西上饶专区在大力发展集体养猪的同时积极帮助社员发展私人养猪。
    过去这个专区往往因为上半年农事季节繁忙，生猪生产上半年松下半年紧。其中一个重要原因是部分地区在贯彻“公养为主，公私并养”方针中，忽视发展私人养猪。为此，今年一开始这个专区就在大力发展以生产小队为主的集体养猪的同时，积极帮助社员发展私人养猪。全专区养猪生产得到了大幅度增长。到6月底止，养猪达到了二百二十七万七千多头，超额二十二万多头完成了上半年的生产任务，比去年同期增长一倍以上。存栏数达一百七十万七千多头，比去年同期增长71.7％。全区集体养猪由过去的30％增长到60％以上，同时私人养猪户数达到了总户数的90％以上。
    上饶专区生猪生产取得高速度发展，是实行政治挂帅，切实加强对生猪生产领导的结果。地、县、公社、大队、生产队都分别成立了养猪生产领导机构，由各级书记挂帅，并有一名书记专门负责。全区五万四千多人的养猪专业队中，党团员占10％以上。各地在发展集体养猪生产中，充分运用人民公社的优越性，开展了县、公社、大队、生产队“四级建场”运动。全区县、公社、大队、生产队等集体养猪场，迅速由去年的一万多个增加到二万七千多个。在加速发展生产中，各地狠狠抓住了繁种、饲料、防疫等环节。各养猪场都把母猪生产放在首要地位，采取“见母就留，先留后选”的办法，增加母猪五十七万多头，完成了全年任务的105.6％。
    在饲料方面，各场都建有饲料基地，组织开荒，大力利用零星土地，使每头猪平均有饲料地达到一分二厘。此外，还利用山塘、水库种植水生饲料，并抓住叶草茂盛季节，组织群众采摘野生饲料，从而保证了饲料需要。在防疫方面，各县、公社、大队、生产队都设立了兽医机构，形成了一个防疫卫生网，有效防止了病疫。
    实行一手抓公养，一手抓私养，以公养带私养，上饶专区采取了许多措施帮助社员发展私人养猪。各级党委对一些群众提出的仔猪、资金、饲料、时间问题都作了切实的安排。猪源由集体养猪场供给，对暂时无法付款的社员，采取了发放养猪预购定金、分期付款、先养后付和卖猪时无息还本等办法扶助养猪。今年1到6月份，全区供应群众仔猪二十四万多头。饲料问题，除平均每头猪有一分二厘饲料地外，除自留地外，每养一头猪供给三十斤精料。在饲养时间上除规定完成包工任务的多余时间由社员自己支配外，每月有三天时间可以从事打柴、搞饲料。各项问题的合理解决，激发了社员养猪的积极性，形成了人人动手，户户养猪的群众运动，现在全区90％以上的农户都养了猪。（附图片）
