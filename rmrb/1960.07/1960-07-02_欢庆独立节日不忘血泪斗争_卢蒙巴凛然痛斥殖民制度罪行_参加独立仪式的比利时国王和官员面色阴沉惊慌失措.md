Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, July 1st: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, speaking at the Congolese independence ceremony on June 30th, said that the era of slavery is over. He said that every Congolese person will not forget that independence was obtained after a struggle involving tears, fire, and blood. After eighty years of colonial rule, the wounds are still so fresh and painful that we cannot forget them.

The Prime Minister recounted, in the presence of Belgian King Baudouin, the humiliation and oppression suffered by the Congo under Belgian colonial rule before independence. He said, we experienced an era when land was plundered, laws were unequal between black and white people, and there was political and religious persecution, with white people living in tall buildings and black people living in low, small huts. He also said, who can forget how many of our brothers were hanged and beaten to death?

It is reported that the Belgian King, who had just spoken at the Congolese independence ceremony, listened to Lumumba's speech with a somber expression. Lumumba's words caused panic among the Belgian officials present.

After condemning the shameful colonial system, Lumumba said that an independent Congo will show what black people can do when they labor in freedom. Lumumba announced that the Congo will revise all old laws and enact new ones. He also said that we accept foreign cooperation if such cooperation is just. He said that we respect the agreement (reached with Belgium), but we must also remain vigilant.

The Congolese Prime Minister also called on the Congolese people to forget their tribal conflicts. He concluded by shouting, "Salute to the free warriors of the Congolese nation! Long live the independent and autonomous Congo!"

At 3:00 p.m. on the 30th, a celebration parade was also held in front of the People's Palace, the seat of the Congolese Parliament. The blue flag of the newly independent country flew on the roof of the People's Palace, where the independence ceremony was held. The flag has six small yellow stars and one large yellow star, symbolizing the unity of the Congo's six provinces.

    欢庆独立节日不忘血泪斗争
    卢蒙巴凛然痛斥殖民制度罪行
    参加独立仪式的比利时国王和官员面色阴沉惊慌失措
    新华社1日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴6月30日在刚果独立仪式上发表演说时说，奴隶制时代已经终结了。他说，每一个刚果人都不会忘记，独立是付出了泪、火和血的斗争之后获得的。在八十年殖民统治之后，创伤还是非常新鲜和疼痛的，以至我们不能忘记它。
    这位总理当着比利时国王博杜安的面追述了独立前刚果在比利时殖民统治下遭受的那种侮辱和压迫。他说，我们经历过这样一个时代：土地被掠夺了，黑人和白人之间的法律不平等、政治和宗教的迫害、白人住高楼大厦而黑人住低小茅屋。他还说，谁能忘记得了我们有多少兄弟被绞死和打死呢？
    据报道，参加刚果独立仪式并且刚刚讲过话的比利时国王面色阴沉地听着卢蒙巴的演说。卢蒙巴的话使在场的比利时官员惊惶失措。
    卢蒙巴在谴责了可耻的殖民主义制度之后说，独立后的刚果将会显示出黑人当他在自由中劳动时所能做出的东西。卢蒙巴宣布，刚果将修改所有的旧法律制定新的法律。他还说，我们接受外国的合作，如果这种合作是公正的话。他说，我们尊重（和比利时达成的）协定，但是我们同时必须保持警惕。
    这位刚果总理还要求刚果人忘记掉他们的部族纠纷。他最后高呼，向刚果民族自由战士致敬！独立自主的刚果万岁！
    30日下午三点还在刚果议会所在地民族大厦前举行了庆祝独立的检阅和游行。这座举行独立仪式的所在地民族大厦的屋顶上飘扬着这个新独立国家的蓝色国旗。这面国旗上有象征着刚果六个省团结一起的六个小黄星和一个大黄星。
