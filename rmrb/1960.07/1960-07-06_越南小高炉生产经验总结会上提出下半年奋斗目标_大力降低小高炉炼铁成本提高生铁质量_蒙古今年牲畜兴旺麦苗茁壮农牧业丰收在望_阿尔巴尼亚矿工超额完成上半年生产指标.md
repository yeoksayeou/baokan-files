Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th. Vietnamese Democratic Republic Premier Pham Van Dong, at the Small Blast Furnace Production Experience Summary Meeting convened by the Vietnam National Science Committee, stated that the proposition of using the method of building small blast furnaces to produce iron is a long-term and important proposition put forward by the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government. He pointed out that using small blast furnaces for ironmaking is a method of disseminating technology and bringing technology to the masses.

According to newspaper reports published here today about the meeting, which was held from June 30th to July 3rd, the meeting put forward the second half year goals for small blast furnaces, striving to reduce costs by 10% and ensure that high-quality iron reaches 80% of the total production.

There are currently six small blast furnace units in northern Vietnam, and it is expected that this will develop to twenty by the end of this year. The output of these small blast furnaces is constantly increasing.

Since 1958, local industry in northern Vietnam has seen greater development. Provinces, cities, and districts have established more than 500 units, including small farm tool factories, fertilizer plants, brick and tile factories, agricultural product processing plants, oil presses, indigenous cement manufacturing plants, small hydropower stations, and small blast furnaces. Their output value is equivalent to 13% of the total output value of central industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 4th. The Mongolian People's Republic has seen good livestock breeding this year, continued expansion of agricultural sown area, abundant rainfall, and vigorous growth of crops and pastures, which presages a great prospect for agricultural and animal husbandry production this year.

According to a communiqué released by the Mongolian State Central Statistical Bureau in June, more than 6.38 million young livestock were delivered nationwide, with a survival rate of 91%, of which the survival rate of large livestock reached more than 96%.

In agriculture, this year is the second year of Mongolia's large-scale reclamation of wasteland, with plans to reclaim more than 75,000 hectares. According to materials from the State Central Statistical Bureau, the national sown area this year reached 246,200 hectares, an increase of 50% compared to last year.

Recently, reporters saw that pastures were growing well on the northern grasslands of Mongolia, livestock were gaining weight, and the plans for state-owned farms and agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives to increase livestock were being completed very well. Bulgan Province originally planned to deliver 270,000 lambs this year, and by mid-June, more than 260,000 had been delivered. In addition, there are more than 40,000 pregnant female animals awaiting delivery. Kusu Goul Province delivered more than 390,000 lambs, with a survival rate of 95.2%.

Bulgan Province has sown 16,000 hectares of land this year, double that of 1959. Kusu Goul Province exceeded the plan by 3% with more than 21,000 hectares of land sown. Now the wheat seedlings are strong and thriving, presenting a great harvest scene.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 4th. The Albanian Telegraph Agency reported today: Albanian miners have overfulfilled their production targets for the first half of this year.

In the first six months of this year, miners overproduced 4,557 tons of nickel-iron ore, 1,045 tons of chromium ore, 2,920 tons of copper ore, and 1,885 tons of coal. The production plan for natural asphalt was overfulfilled by 6%.

Several coal mines in Korca and a chromium mine in Bulqizë have completed the production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) ahead of schedule.

    新华社河内5日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同在越南国家科学委员会召开的小高炉生产经验总结会议上发表讲话说，用建设小高炉的办法来生产铁的主张，是越南劳动党和政府提出的长期的和重要的主张。他指出，用小高炉炼铁是传播技术和把技术带到群众中去的方法。
    据这里报纸今天发表的会议消息说，从6月30日到7月3日举行的这次会议提出了下半年小高炉的奋斗目标，力争降低成本10％，保证优质铁达到总生产量的80％。
    越南北方现在有六个小高炉单位，预期到今年年底将发展到二十个。这些小高炉的产量不断增加。
    越南北方的地方工业自从1958年以来，有了较大的发展。各省、市、区建立的包括小型农具厂、肥料厂、砖瓦厂、农产品加工厂、榨油厂、土法水泥制造厂、小型水电站、小高炉等已有五百多个单位，它的产值相当于中央工业的总产值的13％。
    新华社乌兰巴托4日电　蒙古人民共和国今年牲畜增殖情况良好，农业播种面积继续扩大，雨水丰盈，作物和牧草生长旺盛，这预示着今年农牧业生产的大好前景。
    根据蒙古国家中央统计局6月间发布的公报，全国接产幼畜六百三十八万多头，成活率为91％，其中大牲畜的成活率达到96％以上。
    在农业方面，今年是蒙古大量开垦荒地的第二年，根据计划将开垦七万五千多公顷。据国家中央统计局材料，今年全国播种面积达到二十四万六千二百公顷，比去年增加了50％。
    最近记者在蒙古北部草原上看到牧草生长良好，牲畜正在长膘，国营农牧场和农牧业合作社增殖牲畜的计划完成得很好。布尔干省全省今年原计划接羔二十七万头，到6月中已接产二十六万多头。另外还有四万多头怀胎母畜待产。库苏古尔省全省接羔三十九万多头，成活率为95.2％。
    布尔干省今年播种面积为一万六千公顷土地，比1959年增加一倍。库苏古尔省播种的两万一千多公顷土地超额3％完成计划。现在麦苗壮茁，呈现着大好的丰收景象。
    新华社地拉那4日电　阿尔巴尼亚通讯社今天报道：阿尔巴尼亚矿工超额完成了今年上半年的生产指标。
    在今年头六个月中，矿工们超额生产了四千五百五十七吨镍铁矿石，一千零四十五吨铬矿石，二千九百二十吨铜矿石和一千八百八十五吨煤。天然沥青的生产计划超额完成了6％。
    科尔察的几个煤矿和布尔基斯的一个铬矿提前完成了第二个五年计划（1956—1960）的生产指标。
