Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the North China region are currently seizing the opportunity to rush plant autumn vegetables and strengthen field management of summer vegetables, striving for a bumper harvest.

In recent days, under the slogan "Every inch of land must be contested, all land must be planted," all units, from organs to companies, from generals to soldiers, have been working together to plant large quantities of autumn vegetables. A certain unit of the troops in the Beijing area is actively reclaiming idle land around the barracks and wasteland near the garrison, utilizing spare time from training and work, planting over 2,000 mu of radishes, Chinese cabbage, and melons. A certain unit stationed in Hebei Province actively reclaimed "ten edges" land such as beside houses, roadsides, and riverbanks, planting more than 400 mu of vegetables in one week. Another unit stationed in Hebei Province, while extensively planting "ten edges" land, actively learned the experience of intercropping and interplanting from local farmers, adopting methods such as planting cowpeas in cornfields, adding Chinese cabbage in potato fields, planting radishes on garden ridges, and planting buckwheat on field edges, planting about 2,600 mu of autumn vegetables and late autumn crops. The area sown with autumn vegetables by these troops this year has greatly increased compared to last year, with some increasing by one to two times. Some troops have now planted an average of two fen of autumn vegetables per person, and some have even reached three fen.

In order to plant autumn vegetables well and in sufficient quantity, many leading organs of the troops, in addition to issuing instructions and mobilizing, have also held small-scale vegetable planting training classes or symposiums for vegetable planting experts to exchange and promote advanced experience. Many leading cadres also personally went to the vegetable fields and studied with officers and soldiers how to ensure that more is planted, planted well, and seedlings emerge evenly.

While rushing to plant autumn vegetables, all units have also strengthened the field management of summer vegetables. A certain unit stationed in the Saiwai region adopted the method of assigning people, assigning tasks, contracting by area, and vigorously grasping appraisal, and recently carried out an activity of loosening the soil, topdressing, watering, weeding, and checking and replanting seedlings, so that all vegetable fields had complete numbers of plants, each plant growing sturdily. Another unit stationed in North China built three small reservoirs and opened 170,000 meters of canals to ensure a bumper harvest of summer vegetables, so that all vegetable fields could be irrigated in times of severe drought and drained in times of flooding. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer, some troops not only mobilized all officers and soldiers to actively accumulate fertilizer but also established small fertilizer plants themselves. In order to gain experience in field management, a certain unit also organized officers and soldiers to visit people's communes, invited old farmers to the team to give reports, and ensured that each vegetable field was watered eight times, fertilized three times, weeded three times, sprayed three times, and caught insects three times.

    利用空隙时间　开垦闲散土地
    解放军驻华北部队抢种秋菜
    新华社二十五日讯　中国人民解放军驻华北地区的部队，目前正在抓紧时机，抢种秋菜，加强夏菜田间管理，力争蔬菜丰收。
    最近几天，各部队在“寸土必争，有地必种”的口号下，从机关到连队，从将军到士兵一齐动手，种下了大批秋菜。北京地区部队某部，利用训练、工作等空隙时间，积极开垦营区周围的闲散土地和驻地附近的荒地，种下萝卜、白菜和瓜类两千多亩。驻河北某部队积极开垦屋旁、道边、河畔等“十边”地，一周时间种菜四百多亩。驻河北的另一支部队，在大种“十边”地的同时，积极向当地农民学习套种、间作的经验，采用玉米地里种豆角，马铃薯地里加白菜，园田埂上点萝卜，地头边上种荞麦等方法，种下秋菜和晚秋作物等约二千六百亩。这些部队今年播种秋菜的面积比去年都大有增加，有的增加了一倍到两倍。有些部队现已种下的秋菜平均每人二分，有的还达到了三分。
    为了把秋菜种好种足，许多部队领导机关除发出指示，进行动员以外，还举办了小型种菜训练班或种菜能手座谈会，交流和推广先进经验。许多领导干部还亲自下菜地和官兵一起研究如何保证种得多，种得好，菜苗出得齐。
    在抢种秋菜的同时，各部队也都加强了夏菜的田间管理。驻塞北的某部队，采取定人、定任务、分片包干、大抓评比的办法，最近进行一次松土、追肥、浇水、除草和查苗、补苗的活动，使得所有的菜地都是株数齐全，棵棵茁壮。驻华北的另一支部队，为了保证夏菜丰收，修起三座小水库，开渠十七万多米，使所有的菜地大旱能浇，涝时能排。有的部队为了保证肥料充足，除发动全体官兵积极积肥以外，自办了小型化肥厂。某部为了取得田间管理的经验，还组织官兵到人民公社参观，请老农来队作报告，每块菜地都做到了浇八次水、上三次肥、拔三遍草、喷三次药和捉三次虫。
