    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 4th: The No. 1 giant blast furnace of the Karaganda Iron and Steel Integrated Works in the Kazakh Republic, a key project of the Soviet Union's third iron and steel industry base, has been completed ahead of schedule and tapped iron on July 3rd.
    The Karaganda Iron and Steel Integrated Works is one of the key projects of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. The degree of mechanization of this factory will be higher than that of all existing factories in the Soviet Union. The amount of iron that each worker in this factory can produce per unit time will be twice as much as that of the largest steel factory in the United States. After its completion, this factory will produce more than 3 million tons of steel and more than 2.5 million tons of iron annually, which is equivalent to the total annual steel production of Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution.

    苏联七年计划重点工程之一
    卡拉干达钢厂一号炉出铁
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联第三个钢铁工业基地的重点工程之一——哈萨克共和国卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂的第一号巨型高炉，已经提前建成并在7月3日出铁。
    卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂是苏联七年计划的重点工程之一。这个工厂的机械化程度将比苏联现有的一切工厂都高。这个工厂的每一个工人在单位时间内所能生产的铁将比美国最大的钢铁工厂多一倍。它全部建成以后，这个工厂每年将生产三百多万吨钢和二百五十多万吨铁，这相当于十月革命前沙皇俄国的全部钢铁的年产量。
