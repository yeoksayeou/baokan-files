Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Hunan Province has mobilized the masses to massively produce vehicles and boats to ensure the transportation of key materials such as steel, coal, coke, ore, and grain, meeting the needs of continuous leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production. To date, the province has built over 68,000 tons of wooden sailboats this year, including over 34,000 tons of sideline boats built by people's communes, factories, mines, enterprises, and government agencies and schools; and over 60,000 animal-powered vehicles have been built.

After these newly added means of transport went into operation, they greatly improved short-distance transportation efficiency, saved a large amount of labor, and strengthened the agricultural production front. Daoxian County, located in the southern Hunan region, newly built over 1,970 tons of wooden sailboats and over 1,360 ox and horse-drawn carts this year. Field transportation in all 168 production brigades in the county no longer requires carrying poles, and the transportation needs of 154 small and medium-sized factories and mines have also been basically resolved; the county's short-distance transportation volume completed from January to June this year increased by 1.1 times compared with the same period in the past, basically achieving zero backlog of materials.

During the mass production of vehicles and boats, all localities adhered to the spirit of self-reliance, adapting to local conditions, and utilizing local materials, breaking through barriers in raw materials and technology. At present, all parts of Hunan Province are widely promoting advanced experiences such as using willow branches, thatch bamboo, nan bamboo, and bamboo silk mesh cement to build boats to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials. The wooden sailboat manufacturing factory of Anding Commune in Pingjiang County created a four-ton capacity bamboo raft boat, saving 70% of wood, and it is shallow draft, low cost, less labor-intensive, light and flexible. Yueyang City People's Commune also used willow branches to make a six-ton capacity willow branch motorized sailboat, saving more than 80% of wood and reducing costs by 75%. Dapu Commune in Hengshan County organized carpenters to go up the mountains to build boats and established boat and vehicle building bases in forest areas, logging and manufacturing on the spot. In order to solve the problem of technical manpower, all localities promoted methods such as masters mentoring apprentices and running short-term training courses. Some professional shipbuilding factories also sent technicians to help people's communes and general factories and mining enterprises train technical personnel.

Fuxin Station, a national transportation red banner unit, has undergone four transformations of its road and mining transportation system. It has now built five automatic coal storage and loading lines. As long as the train slowly passes through the automatic line, the entire train can be loaded and driven out of the station in 20 minutes, shortening the time by more than 80 minutes compared with the previous mechanized loading. This is a corner of the mechanized coal storage plant. This reporter.

    湖南大造车船保证重点物资运输
    全省已造好木帆船六万八千多吨，畜力车六万多辆，大大增强了短途运输力量
    新华社长沙电　湖南省发动群众大造车船，确保钢铁煤焦矿石和粮食等重点物资运输，满足工农业生产持续跃进的需要。到目前为止，全省今年已经造好木帆船六万八千多吨，其中人民公社、厂矿企业和机关学校造的副业船三万四千多吨；造好畜力车六万多辆。
    新增添的这批运输工具上阵承担运输任务之后，大大提高了短途运输效率，节约了大批劳动力，加强了农业生产战线。位于湘南区的道县今年新造木帆船一千九百七十多吨，新造牛马车一千三百六十多辆，全县一百六十八个生产大队的田间运输都丢下了扁担，一百五十四个中小型厂矿企业短途运输所用的交通工具问题也基本上解决；全县今年1至6月份完成的短途运输量比过去同期增长一点一倍，基本上做到物资无积压。
    在大造车船中，各地都坚持贯彻自力更生因地制宜和就地取材的精神，大破原材料和技术关。目前湖南全省各地正在普遍推广用柳条、茅竹、楠竹、竹丝网水泥造船等先进经验，解决原材料不足问题。平江县安定公社木帆船制造厂创造了载重四吨的篾质船，节约木材70％，而且吃水浅、成本低、花工少，轻便灵活。岳阳市人民公社还利用柳条制成载重六吨的柳条机帆船，节约木材80％以上，成本降低75％。衡山县大浦公社组织木工上山造船，到林区建立造船造车基地，就地伐木、就地制造。为了解决技术力量问题，各地都推行了师傅带徒弟和办短期训练班等办法。有的专业性的造船工厂，还派技术工人帮助人民公社和一般厂矿企业培训技术力量。

    全国运输红旗单位——阜新车站的路矿运输已经过四次改造，现已建成五条自动贮煤装车线，列车只要从自动线上徐徐经过，二十分钟就可以整列装完车开出车站，比过去机械化装车又缩短了八十多分钟。这是机械化贮煤厂一角。　本报记者
