    "Morning Glow" is Even More Beautiful Than the Morning Glow
    – Thoughts After Watching the Children's Film "Morning Glow"
    Xie Liming
    The children's feature film "Morning Glow" is a precious gift presented to children by Changchun Film Studio for this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day. The film is set in 1958, when primary schools began to implement work-study programs. Through the conflict between Lin Zheng, the principal of Xinhua Elementary School, and the old teacher Jiang, as well as the conflict between the school and individual parents, it reflects one aspect of the educational ideological revolution caused by the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" on the education front. It enthusiastically praises the correctness of the Party's educational policy and its great victory.
    From the film, we see the growth of a group of New China's children under the guidance of the Party. Their communist ideological awareness and moral character are gradually improving, their knowledge is increasing, and their wisdom is being developed. We see that after participating in collective labor and production, the pampered children become brave and love to work; those who did not like to study understand the importance of learning and love to study; the children who used to be mischievous and noisy have strengthened their organizational discipline; they help each other and are united and friendly. The children not only have high enthusiasm for labor, contributing valuable strength to the country's socialist construction, producing high-quality nails, toys, crystal radios, harrows, etc., but also overcome their shortcomings and tempered their character in labor, demonstrating the spirit of communist successors. These are the young shoots of communist laborers who have both communist ideology and modern scientific and cultural knowledge, and who can engage in both mental and physical labor. This shows the great victory of the Party's educational policy and the blossoming and fruiting of "work-study".
    The film vividly reflects the serious ideological struggle that unfolded during the implementation of the Party's educational policy. The children's actions and performance eloquently prove that the Party's policy has a solid mass base, and the children fully support the Party's policy. The Party members and teachers led by Principal Lin, and the parents represented by Master Zhang and others, are firm supporters and executors of the Party's policy. The teachers represented by Teacher Jiang, and the parents represented by Jin Dabao's father and Fang Mingzhu's grandmother, are figures who still possess bourgeois educational ideas. They doubt and oppose the Party's educational policy to varying degrees. They also have the bourgeois worldview of "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" and "all other occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." They absolutely oppose classroom education and production education, and despise and oppose labor. They sometimes admit to collectivist education, but that is only to the extent that they admit that going to the library to read collectively is legitimate, while participating in labor activities is idle wandering, which affects children's concentration on learning. The film powerfully reveals the ideological essence of Teacher Jiang, a representative figure in this regard, with a few concise strokes: on the one hand, she leads the children in reciting in the classroom that labor is glorious and great, but on the other hand, she regards labor as a means of punishing students. The film more directly reveals the essence of the bourgeois worldview through the portrayal of the old lady Fang. When the old lady Fang prevents her granddaughter from participating in carrying tires, she says: "No one in our family's three generations has ever carried a burden on the street." One sentence hits the nail on the head, revealing the profoundness of the ideological struggle in the educational revolution. As Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out in "Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor" ("Red Flag" No. 7, 1958): "To realize the combination of education and labor, we must go through struggle, and there will be a long-term struggle. Why? Because this is a revolution in educational work against thousands of years of old traditions. The principle of separation of mental and physical labor has dominated educational work for thousands of years. All exploiting classes in history have adhered to this principle."
    As a relatively outstanding children's film, the film also has a unique approach to the portrayal of children's characters. The arrangement of many plots makes people convincingly see that this is indeed the behavior of children. For example, after opening a nail factory, the children unintentionally "leak secrets" to the teacher; the children roll tires on the road; three children earnestly teach and learn from each other next to the press, and children give haircuts to adults. The artistic treatment of these plots is relatively successful, fully demonstrating the innocent, lively, enthusiastic, and upward-looking character of the children who shine with the brilliance of our era. It should be said that "Morning Glow" is a new gain in China's children's films. (Attached picture)

    《朝霞》更比朝霞美
    ——儿童影片《朝霞》观后随感
    谢力鸣
    儿童故事片《朝霞》，是长春电影制片厂今年“六一”国际儿童节献给孩子们的一份珍贵礼物。影片以1958年小学校开始实行勤工俭学时为背景，通过新华小学校长林征同老教师江老师的矛盾，以及学校和个别家长们的矛盾，反映了在教育战线上，贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针时所引起的一场教育思想革命的一个侧面，热情歌颂了党的教育方针的正确，和它取得的伟大胜利。
    从影片中我们看见一群新中国的少年儿童在党的教导下的成长。他们的共产主义思想觉悟道德品质逐步提高，知识日益丰富，智慧得到了发挥。我们看到孩子在参加集体劳动生产后，娇生惯养的变得勇敢和爱干活了；不爱读书的懂得了学习的重要，爱读书了；过去爱恶作剧、吵闹的孩子，组织性纪律性都加强了，他们相互帮助，团结友爱。孩子们不但劳动热情很高，为国家的社会主义建设贡献了可贵的力量，生产了质地优良的钉子、玩具、矿石收音机、钉耙等等，而且在劳动中克服了自己的缺点，锻炼了自己的性格，展示出共产主义接班人的精神面貌。这是既具有共产主义思想，又有现代科学文化知识，既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动的共产主义劳动者的幼芽。这里显示了党的教育方针的伟大胜利和“勤工俭学”的开花结果。
    影片生动地反映了在贯彻执行党的教育方针时所展开的一场严肃的思想斗争。孩子的行动和表现，雄辩地证明了党的方针是有着雄厚的群众基础的，孩子们完全拥护党的方针。以林校长为首的党员、教师和以张师傅等人为代表的家长，是党的方针的坚决拥护者和执行者。以江老师为代表的教师、以金大宝的父亲、方明珠的奶奶为代表的家长则是还具有资产阶级教育思想的人物。他们不同程度地怀疑和反对党的教育方针，他们还有着“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”和
  “万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的资产阶级世界观，他们把课堂教育同生产教育绝对对立起来，轻视和反对劳动。他们有时也承认集体主义教育，但那也只是承认到图书馆去集体阅读才是正当的，而参加劳动活动则是闲游荡，影响孩子专心学习。影片用简练的几笔便有力地揭示了这方面的代表人物江老师的思想实质：一面她在课堂上领着孩子们朗诵着劳动是光荣的，伟大的，一面却把劳动当作惩罚学生的手段。影片通过对方老太太的刻划，更直截了当地揭露了资产阶级世界观的本质。当方老太太阻止她的孙女儿参加搬运轮胎时，她说：“咱们家祖宗三代也没人在大街上挑过担子。”一语就道破了问题的本质，揭示了在教育革命中思想斗争的深刻性。正如陆定一同志在《教育必须与生产劳动相结合》（《红旗》1958年第七期）一文中指出的：“实现教育与劳动结合，必须经过斗争，而且将会有长期的斗争。为什么呢？因为这是教育工作中反对几千年的旧传统的一个革命。劳心与劳力分离的原则，在教育工作中已经统治了几千年。历史上的一切剥削阶级，都坚持这个原则。”
    作为一部较出色的儿童片，影片对儿童性格的刻划也有独到之处，许多情节的安排，使人信服地看到这的确是孩子的行为。例如在开办钉子工厂之后，孩子们向老师保密无意中又“泄密”；孩子们在马路上滚轮胎；三个孩子在压力机旁认真地互教互学，小孩给大人理发等等情节的艺术处理，都是比较成功的，充分显示了闪耀着我们时代光辉的孩子们的天真活泼、热情、向上的性格。应该说，《朝霞》是我国儿童影片的新收获。（附图片）
