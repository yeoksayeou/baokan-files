Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: Shanghai's vast numbers of workers, peasants, cadres, students, neighborhood residents, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, braving the humid heat on the 17th, launched a blitzkrieg against mosquitoes and flies, and eliminated mosquito and fly breeding grounds.

Shanghai's Party and government leaders and some members of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee went to the front lines to conduct inspections.

Many factories throughout the city, under the premise of ensuring normal production, organized manpower to engage in the battle to eliminate mosquitoes and flies and carry out large-scale environmental sanitation campaigns. Many workers used the factory's rest days to eliminate the four pests in the factory. Factories in the Zhabei Pengpu Industrial Zone dispatched a large number of workers to dredge ditches and streams, dig up sludge, and remove weeds from the edges of the ditches, then spread lime along the banks, effectively controlling the breeding of mosquitoes and flies. Units such as Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, Yimin Brewery, and Shanghai Ferroalloy Plant in the Wusong District achieved good results by fumigating and killing insects when adjusting dormitories.

The vast number of local residents have a strong enthusiasm for pest elimination. In the Luwan District, all large and small drains, garbage bins, septic tanks, and poultry sheds were treated. Many worker villages also took action to ensure that workers could eat and sleep well and not be disturbed by mosquitoes and flies. Nearly 20,000 people from more than 40 units, including factories and schools in the Changbai New Village area, helped the new village fight mosquitoes and flies and clear weeds.

Staff members of collective welfare undertakings such as neighborhood canteens and nurseries sweated into action, launching a blitzkrieg against mosquitoes and flies and their breeding grounds. The Wulumuqi Lane Satellite Canteen in the Xuhui District, which serves more than 3,000 people, has rarely found mosquitoes and flies since it opened in 1958. Just after five o'clock that morning, they began to inspect and medicate the dozen or so large and small drains around the canteen, and also set up many fly-killing points around the canteen and all the garbage bins.

Green areas are areas where mosquitoes and flies easily breed. Many workers, citizens, and cadres formed shock teams and concentrated on these areas to kill mosquitoes and flies and eliminate breeding grounds. Suburban towns, like the urban areas, actively carried out blitzkrieg activities to eliminate mosquitoes and flies.

    大搞环境卫生  彻底处理粪便
    上海开展围歼蚊蝇突击战
　　新华社上海19日电　上海市广大工人、农民、机关干部、学生、里弄居民、解放军官兵，在17日冒着溽暑，围歼蚊蝇，消灭蚊蝇孳生地。
    上海市党政负责同志和爱国卫生运动委员会部分委员都到第一线进行检查。
    全市许多工厂在保证生产正常进行的前提下，组织人力投入歼灭蚊蝇和大搞环境卫生的战斗。许多工人利用工厂的休息日，在厂里除四害。闸北彭浦工业区的各工厂，出动大批工人疏浚沟浜，挖污泥，铲除沟边杂草，然后沿岸铺洒石灰，有效地控制蚊蝇的孳生。吴淞区上钢五厂、益民酿造厂、上海铁合金厂等单位，在调整宿舍的时候，烟熏杀虫，取得很好的效果。
    广大地区居民除害的干劲很足。卢湾区全区的大小阴沟、垃圾箱、化粪池及家禽棚等都进行了处理。许多工人新村为了保证工人吃好、睡好，不受蚊蝇骚扰，也纷纷行动起来。长白新村地区的工厂、学校等四十多个单位近两万人，帮助新村扑打蚊蝇，清除杂草。
    里弄食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业的工作人员，挥汗上阵，突击围歼蚊蝇和蚊蝇孳生场所。有三千多人搭伙的徐汇区乌鲁木齐里卫星食堂，自1958年开办以来，很少发现蚊蝇。这一天早晨五时刚敲过，她们又开始对食堂周围大大小小十多条阴沟进行检查下药，还在食堂周围和所有的垃圾箱设置下许多毒蝇点。
    绿化地带是极易孳生蚊蝇的地区，许多工人、市民和机关干部组成突击队，集中到这些地区扑灭蚊蝇、消灭孳生地。郊区城镇与市区一样，积极开展了围歼蚊蝇的突击活动。
