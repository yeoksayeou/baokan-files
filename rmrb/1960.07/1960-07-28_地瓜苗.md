    Sweet Potato Seedlings
    It was noon, and the weather was particularly sultry. The staff of the Zhangdian District Transportation Bureau in Shandong were all taking a lunch break. Director Wang Shouwen was still in his office, reviewing documents. Suddenly, a rapid telephone ring rang out, "Ding-a-ling! Ding-a-ling!" He put down the documents, wiped the sweat from his face, and picked up the receiver. "This is the Transportation Bureau." "There is a batch of sweet potato seedlings that need to be immediately moved from the train station to the bus station, for transport to the Yan'jia People's Commune..." "Okay, we'll move them right away." He put down the receiver, thinking: The commune members are so urgently waiting for the sweet potato seedlings; no matter what, they must be moved immediately. But the workers were all on their lunch break. What to do? Coincidentally, two girls from the business section hadn't rested yet. He pulled up a flatbed cart and greeted them: "Girls, we have an emergency task, come with me." As soon as the two girls heard it was an emergency task, they followed Wang Shouwen to the station freight yard without hesitation.
    Comrade Wang, who had been sent by the Yan'jia People's Commune to handle the transport, was waiting anxiously when he suddenly saw the flatbed cart arrive. He immediately said: "Comrades, could you please hurry? If this batch of sweet potato seedlings isn't moved to the bus station by two o'clock, there won't be a bus to Zhanhua County today. If they can't be transported to the commune today..." Wang Shouwen, with a smiling face and comforting tone, said: "Comrade, don't worry, we definitely won't miss the time, and we guarantee they'll be transported to the commune today." As he spoke, Wang Shouwen shouldered a bundle of sweet potato seedlings and loaded it onto the cart, and the two girls also worked diligently. Wang Shouwen's arm was scratched, and sweat washed over his entire body. He didn't seem to notice, until all thirty-some bundles of sweet potato seedlings were moved to the bus station. Only after watching the bus with a trailer haul the sweet potato seedlings away did Wang Shouwen breathe a long sigh of relief: "Finally, we didn't miss the time."

    地瓜苗
    中午，天气格外闷热。山东张店区交通分局的职工都午休了。王寿文局长还在办公室里批阅文件。突然，叮铃！叮铃！响起了一阵急促的电话铃声，他放下文件，擦了擦满脸汗水，拿起耳机。“我是交通分局。”“有一批地瓜苗要从火车站立即搬到汽车站，运往阎家人民公社。……”“好，我们马上去搬运。”他放下耳机，心想：社员们是多么急等地瓜苗啊，无论如何要马上搬运。可是工人们都午休了。怎么办呢？可巧，营业股的两个姑娘还没休息。他拉起地排车，就向她们打招呼：姑娘们，有紧急任务，跟我走。两位姑娘一听是紧急任务，就毫不犹豫地跟随王寿文直奔车站货场而去。
    阎家人民公社派来办理运输的王同志正等的发急，忽然看见来了地排车，开口就说：“同志，你们快一点好不好，这批地瓜苗要是两点钟搬不到汽车站，今天再没有到沾化县去的车了，如果今天再运不到公社，……”王寿文笑容满面而又带有安慰的口气说：“同志，放心好了，绝不会误了时间，保证今天能运到公社去。”说话间，王寿文就扛起一捆地瓜苗装到车上，两个姑娘也跟着紧张地干。王寿文的臂膀被划破了，汗水冲洗了他的全身，他好像没有发觉似的，直到把三十多捆地瓜苗全部搬运到汽车站。当王寿文眼看着大客车挂着拖斗把地瓜苗运走以后，才轻松地长喘了一口气：“总算没误时间。”
