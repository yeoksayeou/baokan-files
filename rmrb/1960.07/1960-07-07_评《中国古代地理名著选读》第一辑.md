    China has a long history of geographical writings. These contain many valuable legacies that need to be critically inherited. However, due to the large number of such ancient books and their great age, beginners find it difficult to read them. Therefore, selecting several representative famous works, scientifically organizing them, and making it easier for readers to understand the content of ancient books is a very meaningful task. The first series of "Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geographical Works" (hereinafter referred to as "Selected Readings") is published according to such a need.
    The first series of "Selected Readings" includes four books: "Yu Gong," "Geography of the Book of Han," "Commentary on the Waterways Classic," and "Travels of Xu Xiake." These four books have their unique characteristics in terms of content and writing style, so their representativeness is very significant.
    "Yu Gong" is a chapter in the oldest existing historical book in China, the Book of Documents, and was written around the early third century BC. It pioneered the method of studying the geographical conditions of various regions from a regional perspective. According to this method, "Yu Gong" broke the original boundaries of large and small states, and used natural mountains and rivers as the standard for dividing the country into nine provinces. For each of these nine provinces, it described the distribution and management of mountains and rivers, soil, vegetation, and minerals, the grades of fields and taxes, special products and handicrafts, and the routes for transporting various products to the central government, all in extremely concise language. All these descriptions are imbued with a spirit of verification, making this work the originator of the verification school. More than two thousand years ago, with underdeveloped transportation and prevalent witchcraft, this was not easy to achieve. In addition, the author of "Yu Gong" also used this work to promote his ideal of unification, giving this work a clear political purpose. "Geography of the Book of Han" is the earliest of the geographical treatises in official history. It was the first to use administrative divisions as the framework to describe the national territory, administrative regions, population, products, historical evolution of establishments, as well as mountains, rivers, and local customs. The style of writing pioneered by "Geography of the Book of Han" had a significant impact on later geographical books. Although "Commentary on the Waterways Classic" is also a comprehensive geographical work, it is unique in that it uses waterways as the framework. Relying on his own field observations and extensive reading of predecessors' works and maps, the author not only described the origins and veins of large and small river systems in detail, but also described the natural geography and economic geography phenomena of various places in detail. The scope of this work is very broad, even beyond the borders of today's China. This work encompasses everything, including mountains and rivers, land products, historical evolution of establishments, the rise and fall of settlements, and various natural geographical phenomena. The descriptions often involve information on hydrology, climate, soil, and vegetation. Because the author selected a large number of ancient books and inscriptions in this work, these materials were saved from loss and preserved. The author also recorded many folk songs, proverbs, dialects, and legends, which are also extremely valuable. Therefore, this work can be said to be a summary of geographical research in China before the Northern Wei Dynasty. In addition, the brilliant writing style gives this work a high literary value. As for "Travels of Xu Xiake," the author laid the academic foundation of this work with his outstanding achievements in systematically observing and interpretively describing natural geographical phenomena. Especially in the investigation and research of karst landforms, this work is not only the earliest document in China but also in the world. The author also conducted in-depth observations and faithful descriptions of the erosive effects of rivers, the principle of groundwater pressure, the characteristics of rocks in various places, the relationship between plants and the environment, the characteristics of plants in various places, and the economic geography of various places. As for the literary value of this work, it is well known.
    Among these four famous works, except for "Yu Gong," which is fully annotated, the other three are excerpts, and the excerpts are also appropriate. Before selecting and annotating each book, "Selected Readings" provides a concise introduction to the basic content of each book, the author's life, the writing era, and its value in geography. This gives readers a general understanding of the whole book first, making it easier to read the original text.
    Annotation is an important part of this book. Except for "Travels of Xu Xiake," the aforementioned four famous works have been annotated by many scholars before. However, what "Selected Readings" has done is not limited to collecting and organizing old theories, but has its own unique features. The annotation of "Selected Readings" focuses on the elaboration of geographical content, pointing out the correctness and errors of the original work. This makes it essentially different from the tedious and rambling textual research of the past. Due to the limitations of the times, the ancients had limitations in their acquisition of knowledge, especially for the geographical knowledge of remote areas at that time, it was impossible to know it very clearly, so that the records often had errors or were not accurate enough. For example, "Yu Gong" connects Mount Min and Mount Heng together, and "Travels of Xu Xiake" still believes that the Yangtze River originates from Mount Min, and "Selected Readings" corrects these errors. Ancient books sometimes have errors and omissions due to repeated copying, and "Selected Readings" also conducts textual research on these errors, so that the meaning of the original book can be reasonably explained. Some records in ancient books were accurate at the time, but later became inconsistent with the current situation due to changes in geographical phenomena. If you do not examine them carefully, you will think that the records in ancient books are wrong. For example, the Si River in Chengshi County, Jiyin Prefecture, in the "Geography of the Book of Han" seems to be completely wrong in terms of the three issues of water name, source, and the location where it enters the Huai River, but "Selected Readings" compares the "Book of Han" with the "Commentary on the Waterways Classic" and finds that this is due to the change of waterways. The record in the "Book of Han" is not only not wrong, but can also help us understand the changes in waterways. The records in ancient geographical books are sometimes too brief, and "Selected Readings" makes explanations by referring to other relevant historical materials. In the past, most of the annotations of ancient books were tedious textual research citing scriptures and classics, and could not explain the problem. Some of the annotations in "Selected Readings" are not based on books, but on field investigations, using facts to corroborate the original book. For example, the selectors and annotators of the Chexiang Canal in the "Shui Jing Zhu" ? Shui Baoqiu Shui articles, in addition to describing its route and its changes, also linked it to the current facts and pointed out the relationship between the current Yongding River diversion canal in the western suburbs of Beijing and the Chexiang Canal. This scientific method of using field investigation to annotate ancient books breaks the traditional scope of textual research. In addition, the annotations in this book also use maps to reproduce the ancient geographical situation in front of us, so that we can better understand ancient books and more deeply understand the development laws of geographical phenomena. Based on the "Commentary on the Waterways Classic," the book restores Beijing and its nearby waterways 1,700 years ago, and the waterways near Chang'an in the Han Dynasty. Moreover, the book also uses other excavation and investigation materials to produce a restoration map of the Jianzhang Palace area ruins and canals of Chang'an City in the Han Dynasty. These maps are a fairly successful attempt in the restoration work of historical geography.
    Due to the different nature of each book, the annotations of each book are not written by the same person, so the quality of the annotations is not balanced. For example, the annotations of the Wei River chapter in "Yu Gong" and "Commentary on the Waterways Classic" do not fully implement the general spirit of elaborating geographical content. The annotations of "Yu Gong" are sometimes too elaborate, so that the annotator's own arguments are not clear and prominent enough; the annotations of the Wei River are too brief and focus on the evolution. The annotations are also not rigorous enough. For example, under Liangzhou in "Yu Gong," bears, brown bears, and foxes, and in the Wei River article, personal names are all annotated one by one, but some geographical content is not annotated in detail. "Yu Gong" comprehensively describes the types and characteristics of soil in the nine provinces of the country, which has high value in the study of soil geography in China. In recent years, many scientific workers have studied it from the perspective of soil science and have reached relatively consistent opinions. However, the annotations on the soil of "Yu Gong" in this book are mostly based on old theories, and have not fully absorbed the scientific research results of modern times, which not only weakens the scientific content of the annotations, but also affects the elaboration of the scientific value of the original book. Some of the content of the annotations is also questionable in terms of scientificity. For example, it is not appropriate to call the Niaoshu Mountain in the upper reaches of the Wei River in the annotations "belonging to the Liupanshan Mountains of the North Ridge." Because if the North Ridge is the Qinling Mountains, then its structure is different from that of the Liupanshan Mountains, and the era of mountain building is also different, and the two should not be combined. In addition, there are individual annotations that are repeated before and after in each chapter.

    评《中国古代地理名著选读》第一辑
    中国科学院地理研究所编辑　科学出版社出版

    关于我国地理，历代都有著作。其中包含很多宝贵的遗产，需要批判地继承。但是，由于这类古籍的数量很大，年代久远，初学者阅读起来有一定的困难。因此，从中选出若干种代表性的名著，加以科学的整理，使读者易于理解古籍的内容，这是一件很有意义的工作。《中国古代地理名著选读》（下文简称《选读》）第一辑，正是根据这样的需要而出版的。
    《选读》第一辑收有《禹贡》、《汉书地理志》、《水经注》和《徐霞客游记》四种。这四种书在内容上和写作方式上都有其独特之处，所以代表性十分显著。
    《禹贡》是我国现存最古的史书——尚书中的一篇，成书的年代大约是公元前第三世纪初期。它开创了从区域的角度来研究各地区地理情况的方法。根据这个方法，《禹贡》打破了原有大邦、小邦的疆界，以自然的山川作为分界标准，把全国划分为九州。对于这九州的各个区域，它都以极其简洁的文字，记述了其中山川的分布和治理经过，土壤、草木和矿产，田亩和赋税的等级，特产和手工业品，运输各种产品到中央的路线等等。所有这些记述，贯彻了征实的精神，因而使这部著作成为征实派的始祖。在两千多年以前，交通不发达，巫风盛行，这是不容易做到的。此外，《禹贡》的作者还通过这部著作来宣传他的大一统的理想，又使这部著作具有鲜明的政治目的性。《汉书地理志》是正史地理志中最早的一部。它第一次以行政区划为纲，叙述了全国疆域、政区、人口、物产、建置沿革以及山川和地方风俗等等。《汉书地理志》所开创的这样一种著述的体例，对于后来的地理书籍有重大的影响。《水经注》虽然也是一部综合性的地理著作，但是它以水道为纲，所以它又别具一格。作者依靠自己的实地观察，又遍览前人的著作和地图，不仅详细地记述了大小河系源流脉络，而且还详细地记述了各地的自然地理和经济地理现象。这部著作所记述的范围很广，甚至超越了今天中国的疆界。对于山脉河流、土地物产、建置沿革、聚落兴衰以及自然地理的各种现象，这部著作都无不兼容并包。记述中还常常涉及有关水文、气候、土壤和植被等资料。由于作者在这部著作中选录了大量的古籍和碑刻，这些资料得以免于亡失而保存下来。作者还记载了不少民间的歌谣、谚语、方言和传说等，这也是极其可贵的。因此，这部著作可以说是北魏以前我国地理研究的总结。此外，文笔的绚烂又使这部著作具有很高的文学价值。至于《徐霞客游记》，作者则以其系统地观察和解释性地描述自然地理现象的杰出成就，奠定了这部著作在学术上的地位。特别是在石灰岩地貌的考察和研究方面，这部著作不仅是我国而且也是世界的最早的文献。对于河流的侵蚀作用、地下水压力的原理、各地岩石的特征、植物与环境的关系、各处植物的特点以及各地有关经济地理的情况等等，作者也都进行了精深的观察和忠实的描述。至于这部著作在文学上的价值，更是众所共知的了。
    这四部名著之中，除了《禹贡》是全部注释以外，其他三种都是选录，选录得也是恰当的。《选读》在选注一书之前，对于各书的基本内容、作者生平、写作时代和它在地理学上的价值，都作了扼要的介绍。这使读者对于全书首先有一个概括的理解，便于进而阅读原文。
    注释是本书的重要部分。前述四种名著，除《徐霞客游记》外，以前都已经有很多学者作过注释。但是，《选读》所做的，不是仅限于汇集和整理旧说，而是另有其独到的地方。《选读》的注释着重在地理内容的阐发，指出原著的正确和错误。这使得它和过去那种繁琐枝蔓的训诂考证有本质上的区别。由于时代的限制，古人对于知识的获得有其局限性，尤其是对于当时边远地方的地理知识不可能知道得很清楚，以致记载常有错误，或者不够正确。例如，《禹贡》将岷山和衡山连在一起，《徐霞客游记》江源考仍认为长江发源于岷山，《选读》对于这类错误都作了纠正。古籍有时因辗转传抄而发生错简脱落，《选读》对于这类错误也作了考证，使原书的文义得到合理的解释。古籍的记载，有的在当时原是准确的，后因地理现象发生了变化而和现在的情况不相符合。如果不仔细审察，就会以为古籍的记载是错误的。例如，《汉书地理志》济阴郡乘氏县的泗水，初看起来在水名、水源、入淮地点三个问题上似乎全都错了，但是《选读》将汉志和《水经注》相对照，发现这是由于水道的变化所致。《汉志》的记载不仅没有错误，而且正可帮助我们了解水道的变迁。古代地理书籍的记载有时过于简略，《选读》参证其他有关的史料作了说明。过去对古书的注释绝大部分是引经据典作繁琐的考证，不能说明问题。《选读》有一部分注释不是根据书本，而是根据实地考察，以事实来和原书相印证。例如，《水经注》?水鲍丘水两篇中的车箱渠，选释者除叙述了它的路线及其变迁以外，并和当前的事实联系起来，指出了现今北京西郊的永定河引水渠道和车箱渠之间的关系。这种运用实地考察来注释古书的科学方法，打破了过去训诂考证的传统范围。此外，本书的注释还利用地图将古代的地理情况重现在我们的面前，使我们能够更好地去理解古籍，更深刻地去认识地理现象的发展规律。书中根据《水经注》，复原了一千七百年以前的北京及其附近水道，和汉朝长安附近的水道。并且，书中还利用其他的发掘调查资料，作出了汉长安城建章宫区遗址及渠道复原图。这几幅地图在历史地理学的复原工作上，是一种相当成功的尝试。
    由于各书的性质不同，各书的注释也不是一个人写的，所以注释的质量并不是平衡的。例如，《禹贡》和《水经注》中渭水篇的注释，就没有完全贯彻地理内容的阐发的总精神。《禹贡》的注释有时还繁证博引，致使注释者自己的论断反而不够鲜明突出；渭水的注释则失之太简，并且偏重在沿革方面。注释也有不够严谨的地方。如《禹贡》梁州之下对于熊、罴、狐狸，渭水一文对于人名，都一一作了注释，而对于一些地理性很强的内容，反而注释得很不详细。《禹贡》全面地叙说了全国九州的土壤种类和特性，在我国土壤地理的研究上有很高的价值。近年以来已有不少的科学工作者从土壤学的观点对它进行研究，并且取得了比较一致的意见。但是本书关于《禹贡》土壤的注释，大半是因袭旧说，而没有充分吸收近代的科学研究成果，这就不仅削弱了注释的科学内容，而且也影响到对原书的科学价值的阐发。也有一些注释的内容在科学性上是值得商榷的。例如，注释中称渭河上游的鸟鼠山“属北岭六盘山系”，就不妥当。因为如果北岭就是秦岭的话，那末它和六盘山构造不同，造山的时代也不同，二者是不应合在一起的。此外，各篇之中有个别的注释，前后也有重复。
