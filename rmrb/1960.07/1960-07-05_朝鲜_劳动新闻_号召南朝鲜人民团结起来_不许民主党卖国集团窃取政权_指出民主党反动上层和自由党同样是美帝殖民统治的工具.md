Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 3rd: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, exposing the traitorous nature of the South Korean "Democratic Party's" reactionary upper echelons, and calling on the South Korean people to unite and resolutely expose and condemn the reactionary conspiracy of the "Democratic Party's" reactionary upper echelons to take the stage as new tyrants.

The commentary pointed out that there is virtually no boundary or difference between the "Democratic Party's" upper echelons and Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party." They both serve the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism, represent the interests of South Korean landlords and comprador capitalists, and support and implement the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said that after the traitor Syngman Rhee was overthrown, the reactionary upper echelons of the "Democratic Party," who in fact controlled the South Korean puppet regime, are engaging in various conspiracies in order to formally "inherit" the puppet regime through the "elections" of the "House of Representatives" and "Senate" on July 29. The "Democratic Party" ruling group has now completely replaced the position of Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" in the past and openly appeared as a tool of U.S. imperialist colonial rule.

The commentary pointed out that the "Democratic Party" has historically colluded with Syngman Rhee and stood on an anti-people stance. Chang Myon, the Supreme Committee Representative of the "Democratic Party," described himself at a press conference as the "only force against Syngman Rhee," but in fact, it was he who colluded with U.S. imperialism to help Syngman Rhee become "President." The Syngman Rhee group's "passage" and "ratification" of various fascist decrees and traitorous treaties in the puppet National Assembly were all carried out with the assistance of the "Democratic Party's" upper echelons. Many massacres of innocent people that have been successively exposed in South Korea recently also occurred when Chang Myon and Cho Pyong-ok, another leader of the "Democratic Party," held important positions in the puppet regime.

The commentary said that on April 18th and 19th, when the people of Seoul held demonstrations against Syngman Rhee's fascist terror rule, the "Democratic Party's" members of the National Assembly shouted to the demonstrators "Obey order," "Stop and dissolve the demonstration," and conspired to sabotage the demonstration crowds. During the Masan People's Uprising, "Democratic Party" members attempted to prevent the masses from taking to the streets, and they also held secret talks with Syngman Rhee's police chief to discuss suppressing the people's uprising.

The commentary pointed out that the South Korean people shed blood to overthrow the traitor Syngman Rhee, but their fruits were seized by the "Democratic Party." It is because of the obstruction of U.S. imperialism and its new lackey Heo Jeong, as well as the reactionary upper echelons of the "Democratic Party," that none of the demands for freedom, democracy, and the right to survival put forward by the South Korean people have been realized.

The commentary said that in May, when the people of Busan, Daegu, and other places carried out fierce struggles chanting slogans such as "Corrupt National Assembly, step down!" and "McConaughy (U.S. Ambassador to South Korea), get out!", it was the "Democratic Party's" members who demanded the suppression of the people.

The commentary pointed out that the true face of the "Democratic Party's" upper echelons has become more exposed as the South Korean "election" on July 29th approaches. Their methods in the "election" are exactly the same as those of Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party."

The commentary pointed out that all the conspiracies of the "Democratic Party's" upper echelons prove that in the past, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, they actively helped the Syngman Rhee group suppress the people. Today, they are replacing the "Liberal Party" in a vain attempt to monopolize power and take the stage as new tyrants.

The commentary emphasized that it is no accident that the South Korean people are chanting slogans such as "Neither the Liberal Party nor the Democratic Party is good!" The commentary called on the South Korean people to unite, resolutely expose and condemn the conspiracies of the "Democratic Party's" reactionary upper echelons, and prevent them from seizing power. The commentary emphasized that this is one of the most important tasks for the South Korean people to strive for freedom, democracy, and the right to survival at present.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”号召南朝鲜人民团结起来
    不许民主党卖国集团窃取政权
    指出民主党反动上层和自由党同样是美帝殖民统治的工具
    据新华社平壤3日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，揭露南朝鲜“民主党”反动上层的卖国本质，同时号召南朝鲜人民团结起来，坚决揭露和谴责“民主党”反动上层企图以新的暴君的姿态登台的反动阴谋。
    评论指出，“民主党”的上层同李承晚的“自由党”事实上没有任何的界限或差别。它们都是为美帝国主义的殖民统治服务的，都代表着南朝鲜的地主和买办资本家的利益，都支持和实行美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    评论说，在卖国贼李承晚被打倒后，事实上掌握了南朝鲜傀儡政权的
  “民主党”的反动上层，为了通过7月29日的“众议院”和“参议院”的“选举”正式“继承”傀儡政权，正在进行着各种阴谋活动。“民主党”的统治集团现在完全代替了过去李承晚的“自由党”的地位，公开地以美帝国主义的殖民统治工具出现。
    评论指出，“民主党”在历史上一贯地同李承晚相勾结，站在反人民的立场上。“民主党”的最高委员代表张勉在记者招待会上把自己说成是什么“唯一的反李承晚的势力”，事实上正是他勾结美帝国主义帮助李承晚当上了“总统”。李承晚集团在傀儡国会“通过”和“批准”种种法西斯法令和卖国条约，都是在“民主党”上层集团的协助下进行的。最近在南朝鲜陆续揭发出来的许多集体屠杀无辜人民的惨案也都是在张勉和“民主党”的另一个头子赵炳玉担任傀儡政权的要职时发生的。
    评论说，在4月18日和19日，汉城人民举行反对李承晚法西斯恐怖统治的示威时，“民主党”的国会议员到示威群众面前叫嚷“遵守秩序”、“停止和解散示威”，阴谋破坏示威的群众队伍。马山人民起义时，“民主党”的议员企图阻挡群众上街，他们还同李承晚的警察头子进行密谈，商量镇压群众的起义。
    评论指出，南朝鲜人民为打倒卖国贼李承晚流了血，但是他们的果实却被
  “民主党”窃夺去了。就是由于美帝国主义和它的新走狗许政以及“民主党”的反动上层的阻挠，南朝鲜人民提出的自由、民主和生存权利的要求条件一条也没有能够实现。
    评论说，5月间，釜山、大丘等地人民高呼“腐败的国会滚下台来！”“麦康瑙吉（美国驻南朝鲜大使）滚出去！”等口号进行激烈的斗争时，要求对人民进行镇压的也正是“民主党”的议员。
    评论指出，“民主党”上层的真面目在南朝鲜7月29日的“选举”即将到来的时候更加暴露出来了。他们在“选举”中的手法同李承晚的“自由党”是完全一样的。
    评论指出，“民主党”上层集团的一切阴谋证明，他们过去在美帝国主义的操纵下积极帮助李承晚集团镇压了人民，今天他们代替“自由党”妄图独霸政权，以新的暴君的姿态登台。
    评论强调说，南朝鲜人民高呼“自由党和民主党都不是好东西！”的口号并不是偶然的。评论号召南朝鲜人民团结起来，坚决揭露和谴责“民主党”反动上层的阴谋，使他们不能掌握政权。评论强调指出，这是南朝鲜人民目前争取自由、民主和生存权利的最重要的斗争任务之一。
