Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Leopoldville Dispatch: Since the Belgian government blatantly dispatched troops to suppress the anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese people, the Congolese people's anti-Belgian colonial sentiment has become even higher, the scope of the struggle has expanded further, and armed struggle has been launched against the Belgian colonial army.

The struggle of Congolese soldiers against Belgian colonialists continuing to serve as officers in the Congolese army is continuing to develop. It is reported that Congolese troops from Jadotville and Hecquerville in the Katanga province of the Congo are marching south towards Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province. In Elisabethville, Congolese soldiers are fighting against 300 Belgian paratroopers who are armed to suppress them.

In Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai province, angry Congolese soldiers have surrounded about a thousand colonialists.

In the Matadi area of Lower Congo, Congolese soldiers have also surrounded colonialists.

Postal and telecommunications personnel in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, went on strike on the 10th. Delegations of telephone, telex, and meteorological workers demanded that the Congolese government transfer the positions currently held by Belgian colonialists to Congolese people.

According to a Brussels dispatch: The Belgian Ministry of Defense announced that Belgium would send three more paratrooper companies and one infantry company on the 11th to suppress the Congolese people's struggle. It also threatened that other paratrooper companies were on standby and could be airlifted to the Congo if necessary. Currently, Belgium already has three paratrooper companies and nine infantry companies in the Congo participating in suppression activities. Belgian Defense Minister Gilson blatantly claimed that Belgian troops would invade fourteen places in the Congo under the pretext of "protecting" colonialists. According to a dispatch from Kitwe: More than three thousand Belgian colonialists who fled the Congo met in Kitwe, Northern Rhodesia on the 10th to plot armed intervention to restore their colonial rule.

According to reports, the United States is currently preparing to participate in the intervention in the internal affairs of the Congo. The Associated Press correspondent in Leopoldville promoted on the 10th in a message that the United Nations should intervene in the Congo. The message also revealed that the US ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, held a secret meeting with UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche (an American) on the evening of the 10th regarding the situation in the Congo.

At the same time, there are reports that Britain is also preparing to intervene. The British colonial authorities in Northern Rhodesia, which borders the Congo, ordered the mobilization of part of the colonial army on the 10th. In addition, the British colonial authorities in Uganda also transferred the colonial army and police there to the border with the Congo in order to wait for an opportunity to intervene.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Leopoldville Dispatch: The Belgian government blatantly dispatched paratrooper units on the 10th, landing in Elisabethville, the capital of the newly independent Congolese Katanga province, to armed suppress Congolese people who were opposing colonialism and holding patriotic demonstrations. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba immediately issued a statement condemning this blatant act of interference in internal affairs by the Belgian government.

According to Western news agency reports, about 300 paratroopers from four aircraft dispatched by the Belgian government began landing in Elisabethville at dawn on the 10th. They immediately joined the battle, armed to suppress the Congolese military and civilians who opposed colonialism. Later, the Belgian authorities transferred another 500 troops from the Kamina military base to participate in the suppression.

At the same time, it was reported that the Belgian authorities also sent paratrooper units to land in Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai province, to suppress the local people's struggle.

Congolese Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Lumumba issued a statement on the evening of the 10th, saying, "We protest against the Belgian army's interference under false pretenses." He said, "The Congolese government cannot tolerate the sending of troops into its territory without its consent." He pointed out that according to the "Treaty of Friendship, Assistance, and Technical Cooperation" recently signed between the Congo and Belgium, "such interference can only be carried out with the consent of the (Congolese) Minister of Defense."

Lumumba strongly protested against this violation of Congolese territory by the Belgian army. At the same time, he said, "We are willing to warn anyone who attempts to occupy our territory with troops," "We will defend our country to the end." Lumumba said that the Congolese government will not tolerate the destruction of Congolese national independence. He said, "The President of the Republic of the Congo has decided, in accordance with Article 1 of our charter, to assign responsible positions in the army and government to our own nationals."

According to a broadcast by Belgian radio, Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs de Schryver and former Belgian Minister to the Congo Van der Meersch arrived in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, on the evening of the 10th, attempting to "advise" Lumumba to accept the Belgian army's "assistance in restoring order."

At the same time, there are reports that the United States is preparing to participate in the intervention. The US 24th Infantry Division in Europe, which participated in the invasion of Lebanon in 1958, is on alert. According to the US Air Force Command in Wiesbaden, West Germany, transport aircraft at the Rhine-Main US Air Force Base near Frankfurt are on standby. A spokesman admitted, "We are in a state of readiness, available if needed."

    新华社11日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：自从比利时政府悍然出兵镇压刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争以来，刚果人民反对比利时殖民主义的情绪更加高涨，斗争范围更加扩大，并和比利时殖民军队展开了武装斗争。
    刚果士兵反对比利时殖民主义者继续留在刚果军队中担任军官的斗争正在继续发展中。据报道，来自刚果加丹加省的贾多特维尔和赫科维西的刚果军队正在向南挺进，开往加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔。在伊利沙伯维尔，刚果士兵正在同武装镇压他们的比利时三百名伞兵进行战斗。
    在开赛省首府路路阿堡，愤怒的刚果士兵包围了约一千个殖民主义者。
    在下刚果的马塔迪地区，刚果士兵也包围了殖民主义者。
    刚果首都利奥波德维尔邮电人员10日举行罢工，电话、电传机和气象工作者代表团要求刚果政府把目前由比利时殖民主义者担任的职务移交给刚果人。
    据布鲁塞尔消息：比利时国防部宣布，比利时11日将增派三个伞兵连和一个步兵连前往镇压刚果人民的斗争。它还威胁说，其它的伞兵连正在待命，一旦需要即可空运到刚果。目前，比利时已经有三个伞兵连和九个步兵连在刚果参与镇压活动。比利时国防大臣纪耳松公然声称，比利时军队将以“保护”殖民者为借口侵入刚果十四个地方。据基特威消息说：有三千多个从刚果逃出来的比利时殖民者10日在北罗得西亚的基特威城开会策划以武装干涉来恢复他们的殖民统治。
    据消息说，美国目前正在准备参与干涉刚果内政。美联社驻利奥波德维尔记者10日在一条消息里宣传由联合国出面干涉刚果。这条消息还透露，美国驻刚果大使廷泊累克10日傍晚同联合国副秘书长本奇

    新华社11日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比利时政府悍然在10日派遣伞兵部队，降落在新独立的刚果加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔，武装镇压反对殖民主义、举行爱国示威的刚果人民。刚果总理卢蒙巴立即发表声明，谴责比利时政府这种粗暴干涉内政的行为。
    据西方通讯社报道，比利时政府派遣的有四架飞机载运的约三百名伞兵部队10日黎明开始在伊利沙伯维尔着陆，他们立即参加战斗，武装镇压反对殖民主义的刚果军民。后来，比利时当局又从加米纳军事基地增调五百名军队去参加镇压。
    同时，据报道，比利时当局还派了伞兵部队在开赛省首府路路阿堡着陆，镇压当地人民的斗争。
    刚果总理兼国防部长卢蒙巴在10日晚上发表声明说，“我们抗议比利时军队在虚假借口下进行干涉的行为。”他说，“刚果政府不能容忍在没有得到它同意的情况下派军队进入它的领土的行为。”他指出，根据刚果和比利时最近签订的
  “友好、援助和技术合作条约”，“只有经过（刚果）国防部长同意，（比利时军队）才能进行这种干涉”。
    卢蒙巴对比利时军队这次侵犯刚果国土提出强烈抗议。同时，他说，“我们愿意警告任何企图用军队占领我国领土的人”，“我们将保卫我们的国家直到最后。”卢蒙巴说，刚果政府不会容忍刚果的民族独立受到破坏。他说，“刚果共和国总统已决定，按照我们宪章的第一条，把军队和政府中的负责职务授给我们自己的国民。”
    另据比利时电台广播，比利时政府的刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣德舒里弗和前刚果驻节大臣范德梅什已经在10日晚上到达刚果首都和利奥波德维尔，企图“劝告”卢蒙巴接受比利时军队“帮助恢复秩序”。
    同时，有消息透露，美国正准备参与干涉。曾经在1958年参加侵略黎巴嫩的美国驻欧第二十四步兵师正处于警戒状态。另据驻在西德的威斯巴登美国空军司令部说，在靠近法兰克福的来因—美国空军基地的运输军队的飞机已处在待命状态。一位发言人承认，“我们处于一种一旦需要我们就可备用的待命状态”。
