    At the Rubber Factory
    The raw materials used by the Jinan Rubber Factory to produce rubber products such as rubber hoses, V-belts, transmission belts, rickshaw tires, and rubber shoes are rubber and cotton cloth. In the first half of this year, the factory's employees created many ways to save cotton cloth while ensuring quality. They reduced the density of the canvas from 38 warps and 34 wefts to 30 warps and 30 wefts. In the past, the canvas was too dense, and the rubber did not penetrate well, making it prone to delamination. After the improvement, the rubber penetration was more even and deeper, and the strength increased from 108 kg to 127 kg, improving the quality. This single improvement can save the country 300,000 meters of cotton cloth annually, and the cost of rubber products has also been reduced. The factory also reduced the number of cloth layers in water pipes below five inches from five to seven layers to four layers, and also reduced the amount of cloth used in five- to six-inch water pipes. After reducing the cloth layers, the quality of the water pipes remained unchanged after water pressure testing. The factory also used miscellaneous fiber cloth to replace some canvas and used scrap materials to make rubber sheets, which also saved a lot of cotton cloth. (Text)

    在橡胶厂里
    济南橡胶厂生产的胶管、三角带、传动带、力车胎、胶鞋等橡胶制品所用的原材料，除橡胶外，就是棉布。今年上半年全厂职工在保证质量的前提下，创造了许多节约棉布的办法。他们把帆布的密度由过去经线三十八根、纬线三十四根减为经纬线各三十根。过去因为帆布太密，吃胶不透，容易脱层；改进以后，吃胶比较均匀、深透，强力由过去的一百零八公斤提高到一百二十七公斤，质量也提高了。仅这一项改进，全年就可为国家节约三十万米棉布，橡胶产品的成本也降低了。这个厂还把五寸以下过水管的布层由五层到七层改为四层，把五寸到六寸的水管用布也减少了一些，布层减少以后，经水压试验，水管质量不变。这个厂还利用杂纤维布代替一部分帆布，利用零碎材料制成胶板，也节约了不少棉布。　（文）
