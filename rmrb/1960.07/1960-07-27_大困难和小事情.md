    Great Difficulties are Not Great, Small Matters are Not Small

    Recently, I was working in the Luoyang Bearing Factory. In one workshop, I found a slogan that read: "Great difficulties are not great, small matters are not small."
    What is great? What is small? People's thoughts differ, so their views also differ. Without ideological liberation, it is impossible to utter the heroic statement that "great difficulties are not great"; those who aim too high and indulge in fantasies without doing practical work will never see that "small matters are not small."
    "Great difficulties are not great, small matters are not small" is the language of our times. The so-called "great difficulties are not great" is a disdain for the difficulties on our path forward. If we establish lofty ambitions ideologically, put "doing" first, then "difficulty" will be solved easily; small difficulties will naturally disappear, and great difficulties will naturally become small.
    Having great ambitions and lofty goals does not contradict doing "small matters." Because the entire socialist revolution is composed of various departments and various concrete "small matters." We must do every matter and every job well for the great cause to succeed. Waste material utilization, saving every bit of material resources, these can be considered "small matters," but they are a necessary means to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and we must pay attention to them and do them well. "Small matters" are like screws on a large machine. They look small, but in reality, you can't do without them, and their role is significant!
    The resounding slogan "Great difficulties are not great, small matters are not small" demonstrates the great aspirations of our working class and their excellent work style of being down-to-earth and seeking truth from facts in practical work.

    大困难和小事情
    聂子洪
    近来在洛阳轴承厂里工作，在一个车间里，发现有一条标语写着：“大困难不大，小事情不小。”
    什么是大？什么是小？人的思想不同，看法也就不同。思想没有解放，决不可能说出“大困难不大”这样的豪言壮语来；好高骛远、只幻想不实干的人，也决不可能看到“小事情不小”。
    “大困难不大，小事情不小。”是我们时代的语言。所谓“大困难不大”，就是对我们前进道路上的困难的蔑视。思想上树立了雄心大志，“干”字当头，“难”字迎刃而解，小困难自然化无，大困难自然化小。
    树雄心，立大志，并不和干“小事情”矛盾。因为整个社会主义革命事业是由各个部门、各种具体的“小事情”组成的。我们要把各个事情、各种工作都做好了，大事业才能成功。废品利用，节约一点一滴的物力财力，这些都算是“小事情”吧，可是，它们是多快好省地建设社会主义的一种必要手段，我们一定要重视，要办好。“小事情”如同大机器上的螺丝钉，看起来小，实则缺少它就不行，作用可大呢！
    “大困难不大，小事情不小”这句响亮的口号，表现了我们工人阶级的雄心壮志，在实际工作中踏踏实实、实事求是的优良作风。
