No Force Can Stop the Development of the Japanese People's Struggle
By Our Commentator

To smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, resolutely oppose violent suppression, and prevent the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet from coming to power—these are the new battle calls issued to the people by the patriotic and progressive forces of Japan after Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his resignation. They are also the central slogans of the twentieth national unified action held by the Japanese people against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Yesterday (July 2), at two large-scale "Declaration of Non-Recognition of the Security Treaty" rallies held in Tokyo, 150,000 workers, students, citizens, and representatives from all over the country spoke passionately, determined to fight to the end to achieve the above goals. Two million people across Japan held demonstrations and rallies in fifty locations, declaring their non-recognition of the new "Security Treaty," demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's violent suppression of the anti-American patriotic movement. The continued development of the Japanese people's struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty precisely shows that the contradiction between the broad masses of the Japanese people and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries will not be eased by the illegal "passage" and "entry into force" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, or by Kishi Nobusuke's forced announcement of his resignation. On the contrary, the Japanese people will certainly not submit. They will wage persistent and unremitting struggles for national independence and democratic freedom, and against the aggressive policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to intensify their arms expansion and war preparations.

Since Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his resignation on June 23, he has been trying to form a new reactionary cabinet to maintain the power and influence of his faction and inherit his traitorous policies without any changes. Kishi Nobusuke once clearly stated that his three principles for privately organizing a new cabinet were: first, to continue to promote and strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance policy in order to "restore Japan's (to the United States) international credibility"; second, to resolutely suppress the Japanese people's struggle in order to "maintain domestic security and order"; and third, to suppress the activities of the anti-mainstream factions within the Liberal Democratic Party in order to "unify intra-party differences" and strengthen reactionary rule over the Japanese people. At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke has intensified repressive measures against the people. Recently, the Kishi Nobusuke clique has arrested more than 100 patriotic workers, students, and people from all walks of life. He is also preparing to carry out larger-scale bloody suppression under the pretext of "sabotaging parliamentary politics" and "behind-the-scenes manipulation by international communist forces." All these rampant activities of Kishi Nobusuke are carried out under the direct instigation of U.S. imperialism.

Faced with the powerful struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, U.S. imperialism has long been uneasy and full of worries. "The New York Times" admitted in an editorial that "the value of any treaty and base depends not only on the consent of the government, but also on whether the people accept it, and whether the Japan-U.S. military treaty can be accepted by the Japanese people remains to be tested." "The Wall Street Journal" also wrote worriedly on July 1: "Neither the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan defense treaty nor Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's promise to resign will do much to ease the pressure on U.S. bases."

In order to save its collapsing aggressive system in Asia, U.S. imperialism is eager to strengthen its control over Japan. U.S. President Eisenhower recently openly stated in a radio address that the United States wants to forcibly implement the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which the Japanese people do not recognize, and drive the Japanese people onto the dangerous road of aggressive war. U.S. Vice President Nixon and Under Secretary of State Dillon also repeatedly clamored that the United States will never change its policy towards Japan and will try to "recover lost ground."

At present, on the one hand, the United States is actively planning to support a government with the "ability to implement the Japan-U.S. military treaty" to replace the Kishi Nobusuke government. The mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital blatantly stated that the next Japanese government should suppress the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people in order to facilitate the United States' pursuit of its aggressive policies. They openly indicated that the new U.S. agents in Japan "must recognize that order is an indispensable aspect of freedom"; emphasizing that "it is necessary for Japan to enact strong anti-demonstration laws." According to Japan's "Mainichi Shimbun," in order to prevent the continued development of internal contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party and facilitate the establishment of the second Kishi cabinet, the U.S. government even openly demanded that Kishi Nobusuke take "party rectification" measures to expel some "anti-mainstream" leaders. On the other hand, the U.S. ruling clique has started its propaganda machine, trying its best to cover up the aggressive essence of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. It attempts to use deceptive propaganda to relax and soften the Japanese people's fighting will. "The New York Post" once complacently believed that this was the "best way" to "remove the fuel from the flames of revolution."

Therefore, in order to continue to push forward the struggle to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, declaring non-recognition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," preventing the establishment of a new cabinet aimed at implementing this aggressive treaty, and resolutely opposing violent suppression are the three-in-one tasks in the current struggle of the Japanese people. In order to turn the slogan of non-recognition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into practical action by the broad masses of the people, the Japanese people are working hard to smash the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy of violent suppression, to strengthen the people's morale and weaken the enemy's prestige; and are resolutely and thoroughly exposing the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to organize the second Kishi cabinet, not allowing Kishi Nobusuke's traitorous policy to be resurrected, and ensuring that the new cabinet does not become a tool for the United States to implement the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Yesterday, the powerful demonstration of 150,000 people in Tokyo and the conferences held across Japan to declare non-recognition of the "Security Treaty" are a new upsurge in the struggle launched by the broad masses of the Japanese people since Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his resignation. The heroic and tenacious Japanese people have already opened up a path of opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, opposing U.S. military bases, and driving away the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism through persistent and unremitting struggle. We firmly believe that after achieving the great victory of the twentieth national unified action, the Japanese people will raise the heroic banner of struggle even higher, continue to unite the broadest forces other than U.S. imperialism and its agents, more powerfully persist in the nationwide mass struggle, and the development of the Japanese people's struggle will be unstoppable by any force!

    任何力量也阻止不了日本人民斗争的发展
    本报评论员
    粉碎日美军事同盟条约、坚决反对暴力镇压、阻止第二个岸信介内阁上台，这是日本爱国进步力量在岸信介被迫宣布下台后向人民发出的新的战斗号召，也是日本人民为反对新日美“安全条约”而举行的第二十次全国统一行动的中心口号。昨天（7月2日）在东京两次举行的声势浩大的“宣布不承认安全条约”大会上，十五万工人、学生、市民和来自各地的代表慷慨陈词，决心为实现上述目标而奋斗到底。日本全国两百万人民，在五十个地方举行示威和大会，宣布不承认新“安全条约”、要求立即解散国会和反对岸信介政府暴力镇压反美爱国运动。日本人民争取废除日美军事同盟条约斗争的继续发展，正是表明了广大日本人民同美日反动派之间的矛盾，绝不会由于日美军事同盟条约的非法“通过”和“生效”、由于岸信介的被迫宣布下台，而有所缓和；相反的，日本人民必定不服。他们将为争取民族独立和民主自由，为反对美日反动派加紧扩军备战的侵略政策，进行坚持不懈、再接再厉的斗争。
    岸信介自从6月23日被迫宣布要下台以后，力图成立一个新的反动内阁，保持他的派系的势力和影响，来原封不动地继承他的卖国政策。岸信介曾经明白表示他私下组织新内阁的三项原则是：一、继续推行和加强对日美军事同盟的政策，以“恢复日本（对美国）的国际信用”；二、坚决镇压日本人民的斗争，以“维护国内的治安和秩序”；三、压制自由民主党内反主流派的活动，以“统一党内分歧”，加强对日本人民的反动统治。与此同时，岸信介加紧对人民采取镇压措施。最近一个时期，岸信介集团逮捕的爱国工人、学生和其他各界人士已达一百多人。他还准备以“破坏议会政治”的罪名和“国际共产主义势力幕后操纵”等借口，进行更大规模的血腥镇压。岸信介的这一切猖狂活动，都是在美帝国主义的直接指使下进行的。
    面对着日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的强大斗争，美帝国主义久已惶惶不安，产生了无穷的忧虑。“纽约时报”就曾在社论中承认“任何条约和基地的价值，不仅取决于政府的同意，而且还要取决于人民是否接受，而美日军事条约能否为日本人民接受，还有待于考验。”“华尔街日报”也在7月1日忧心忡忡地写道：“无论批准新的美日防御条约或岸信介首相答应辞职，对于缓和美国基地所受到的压力都没有多大用处。”
    美帝国主义为了挽回它在亚洲的侵略体系的崩溃，亟图加强对日本的控制。美国总统艾森豪威尔最近在广播演说中公开表明，美国要强行实施日本人民所不承认的日美军事同盟条约，把日本人民驱向侵略战争的危险道路。美国副总统尼克松和副国务卿狄龙也接连叫嚷美国绝不改变对日政策，而且要设法“收复失去的阵地”。
    目前，美国一方面积极策划扶持一个具有“实施日美军事条约的能力”的政府，来接替岸信介政府。美国垄断资本的喉舌明目张胆地表示要日本下届政府压制日本人民的反美爱国斗争，以利美国推行侵略政策。它们公然示意美国在日本的新的代理人“必须认识，秩序是自由的必不可少的方面”；强调“日本有必要制定强有力的反示威法律”。据日本“每日新闻”报道，美国政府为了阻止自由民主党内部矛盾的继续发展，便于第二岸内阁的成立，甚至公开要求岸信介采取“整党”手段，开除一些“反主流派”领袖。另一方面，美国统治集团开动它的宣传机器，极力掩饰日美军事同盟条约的侵略实质。它企图利用欺骗宣传，来松弛和软化日本人民的斗争意志。“纽约邮报”曾经自鸣得意地认为，这是从“革命的火焰下搬走燃料”的“最好的办法”。
    因之，为了要把粉碎日美军事同盟条约的斗争继续向前推进，宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”、阻止成立旨在实施这个侵略条约的新内阁和坚决反对暴力镇压，是日本人民当前斗争中三位一体的任务。日本人民为了使不承认新日美“安全条约”的口号变成广大人民的实际行动，正在努力粉碎岸信介政府暴力镇压的阴谋，来长人民的志气，灭敌人的威风；并在坚决地彻底揭露美日反动派组织第二岸内阁的阴谋，不准岸信介卖国政策借尸还魂，要使得新内阁不再成为美国执行日美军事同盟条约的工具。
    昨天，东京十五万人举行的气势磅礴的大示威和日本全国各地召开的宣布不承认“安全条约”大会，是广大日本人民自从岸信介被迫宣布下台以来掀起的新的斗争高潮。英勇顽强的日本人民，已经在坚持不懈的斗争中，开辟了一条反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美国军事基地、赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的道路。我们坚信，日本人民在取得了第二十次全国统一行动的巨大胜利之后，一定会把斗争的英雄旗帜举得更高，继续团结除了美帝国主义及其代理人以外的最广泛的力量，更强有力地把全民性的群众斗争坚持下去，日本人民斗争的发展，将是任何力量也阻止不了的！
