Ensure Agriculture Has Sufficient Labor

Agriculture is the foundation, and the whole Party and the entire people must grasp agriculture. This is a long-term strategic task, and also the most urgent central task at present.

If agriculture is to truly become the foundation, rural people's communes must further strengthen agricultural production work.

To strengthen agriculture as the foundation, we must greatly develop agricultural productive forces, and the most important issue in greatly developing agricultural productive forces is to ensure that agriculture has sufficient labor. To ensure that agriculture has sufficient labor, we must do a good job in labor allocation within the rural people's communes. So, how should rural people's communes allocate labor?

First, balance capital construction and current production, with current production as the primary focus. Every people's commune must not only do a good job in capital construction, but also do a good job in current production. Capital construction and current production are contradictory, yet unified. They are contradictory because both require labor, and if the labor allocation is inappropriate, it will affect one or the other. This contradiction is essentially a contradiction between long-term interests and current interests. They are unified because the two are mutually causal and mutually promoting. Doing a good job in capital construction will lay the foundation for increased production in the coming year; and doing a good job in current production will provide more strength for capital construction. However, some people's communes have invested too much labor in capital construction, and the labor used for current production appears insufficient, even excessively weakened, which is bound to affect current production. Therefore, future capital construction can only be, and must be, carried out on the premise of not affecting current production. At present, it is the busiest and most intense season for agricultural activities. People's communes that have used too much labor for capital construction, thereby affecting or potentially affecting current production, need to re-allocate labor in the spirit of balancing both, with current production as the primary focus, transferring out the labor that should be transferred and can be transferred to supplement the main battle line of current production.

Second, balance agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries with rural industry, commerce, culture, education, and health, with agriculture as the primary focus. The people's commune is not only a comprehensive operating unit for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but also a unified organizational unit for industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. It cannot but take all these aspects into consideration. All these aspects are also contradictory and unified. However, every contradiction has its dominant aspect. Among these contradictions, agriculture plays the dominant role. This dominant position is not determined by people's will, but is a reflection of objective laws. Because from these many aspects, only by first doing a good job in agricultural production can we better realize the policy of diversified operations and better develop community-run industry, commerce, culture, education, and health. Of course, the development of these aspects will in turn promote the faster development of agricultural production. Therefore, in addition to ensuring the labor necessary for agricultural production, these aspects must also be taken into account. Generally speaking, it is not that these aspects are not being taken into account now, but that they are being considered a bit too much. Paying too much attention to this end is bound to pay less attention to agricultural production, which is not only detrimental to agricultural production, but also detrimental to the implementation of the policy of diversified operations. This situation must be corrected.

Third, in agricultural production, balance grain crops, cash crops, and other crops, with grain crops as the primary focus. Among them, it is also a unified entity of contradictions. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, although our country's grain production has increased sharply, it is still far from meeting the growing needs of the country and the people. Because the grain issue is not just a matter of eating. Years of experience have proved that only by increasing the production of more grain can we better drive the entire agricultural production, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and better realize the policy of diversified agricultural operations. Especially in this year when natural disasters are severe, doing a good job in grain production is even more important. Therefore, all people's communes should first ensure greater increases in grain production. On this premise, they should also ensure the increase in cotton and oil production, and develop the production of hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicinal materials, miscellaneous products, and other crops, according to local conditions. One of the important signs of whether we have correctly implemented this policy is the arrangement of labor. The policy of balancing grain crops, cash crops, and other crops, with grain crops as the primary focus, is a long-term policy. We must not only pay attention to solving this problem in planting, but also pay attention to solving this problem in field management. In the current situation, only by strengthening the field management of grain crops can we guarantee this year's grain increase.

In order to ensure the allocation of labor according to the above-mentioned "three primary" policies, rural people's communes must have an appropriate proportion in the distribution of labor. This proportion is a fixed proportion and also a flexible proportion. It is said to be a fixed proportion, that is, once the proportion is set, it must be handled according to the proportion, first ensuring that the main battle line has sufficient labor and cannot be discounted. From the current point of view, we must try everything possible to ensure that more than 65% of the labor force (including 40% male labor) participates in field labor. It is said to be a flexible proportion, that is, this proportion can be changed with the transformation of agricultural seasons to meet the needs of various productions.

However, this does not mean that every commune can completely solve the problem of labor shortage—that is, the contradiction between the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and the shortage of labor—simply by arranging according to the "three primary" policies. Because the reason why labor is tight is, on the one hand, that the Great Leap Forward in urban and rural areas has occupied some labor (such as supporting urban industry, developing community-run industry, and running various collective welfare undertakings), making the labor directly engaged in field labor relatively reduced; on the other hand, and more importantly, the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" have made the degree of intensive cultivation higher and higher, thus consuming more and more labor. Even if all the rural labor is put into the front line of production, it cannot meet the current needs. Therefore, in the arrangement of labor, rural people's communes must not only calculate carefully, but also calculate flexibly, giving full play to both objective (conditions) and subjective (initiative), and do everything possible to improve labor productivity, so that one person can do the work of two or three people. Otherwise, even if labor is arranged according to the "three primary" policies, there will be two different situations: one is to calculate fixedly and rigidly, and after calculating, you will trap yourself. The more you calculate, the more insufficient labor you will find, and the more you calculate, the greater the difficulties will become. As a result, you will calculate an discouraging account, which will play a role in promoting retreat; the other is to calculate flexibly and actively, and after calculating, you will liberate your mind. The more you calculate, the greater the potential for labor will be, and the more you calculate, the more favorable conditions will be. As a result, you will calculate an encouraging account, which will play a role in promoting progress.

The fundamental way to solve the labor shortage lies in accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture. Therefore, while properly arranging labor, people's communes in various places must continue to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution movements centered on tool reform. Only by doing both of these aspects of work well can we promote the sustained leap forward in agriculture and ensure that agriculture—the foundation of the entire national economy—becomes more and more solid and more and more stable.
(Excerpted from the editorial of the July 14th "Shanxi Daily", "‘Three Primary’ Policies Guarantee the Foundation")

Base on the Principle of Agriculture Being the Foundation to Solve the Contradiction of Labor Allocation

Agriculture is the foundation for our workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers to carry out production and life together, and also the foundation for the development of the entire national economy. If the foundation is not solid, all undertakings will not be solid; if the foundation is not developed, all undertakings cannot be fully developed. Everyone should regard the development of agriculture as their own task, and should actively care about and do everything possible to promote the development of agriculture.

Since the people's communes, rural people's communes have included industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, as well as various undertakings such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, diversified operations, and all-round development. How the leaders of rural people's communes correctly handle and arrange these undertakings and deal with their interrelationships is an important issue. The Party has repeatedly told us that while carrying out diversified operations in rural areas, we must put the development of agriculture in the first place. The vast majority of cadres and masses recognize and implement this, but a very small number do not.

In dealing with the relationship between agriculture and community-run industry in rural areas, some have placed industry in an inappropriate position, occupying too much of the agricultural labor force and affecting the development of agriculture. Developing community-run industry is undoubtedly necessary, but this is a long-term task. When developing community-run industry, we must adhere to the principle that community-run industry first serves the development of agriculture, serves the lives of rural people, and serves large cities. Do not use the main force to develop things that are not related to the development of agriculture, or even directly related to serving the cities. That would weaken agriculture and deviate from the Party's policy of agriculture being the foundation. Some people believe that developing industry is to pursue output value and pursue profits, and feel that this can increase the income of commune members. However, if agriculture does not develop, people do not have enough food, industry does not have enough raw materials, and cannot produce enough daily industrial products, commune members will not actually get any benefits. More importantly, if the cities' light and heavy industries cannot develop due to lack of grain and other industrial raw materials, the rural areas will not be able to develop even more because they cannot get machinery and equipment, which is very detrimental to the long-term interests of farmers. The same is true in arranging the relationship between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in rural areas. Except for areas where forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are the main sources of income, if rural people's communes do not focus on vigorously developing agricultural production with agriculture as the primary focus, and lose agriculture, they will also lose other things, and will inevitably lead to adverse consequences in the end. A small number of cadres and masses do not put agriculture in an important position, despise agriculture, and are not at ease with steadily and actively developing agriculture, and do not improve the lives of rural people in the process of actively developing agriculture. This is harmful, and it is also a reflection of the remnants of the bourgeoisie's idea of ​​despising agricultural labor in the old society, reflected in some cadres and masses. We must earnestly launch debates on this harmful idea, clarify our understanding, and completely overcome it. At present, our agricultural labor productivity is still low, and in order to win the harvest, we still have to spend a lot of labor. Faced with this situation, rural cadres and masses should strive to change the backward state of agriculture, realize the technological transformation of agriculture, and improve labor productivity. Agriculture is always an indispensable and important material production department of the national economy. It is an extremely glorious task for all rural cadres and masses to strive to develop agriculture and provide the people of the country with increasingly abundant food and industrial raw materials.

Developing agriculture also requires correctly handling the relationship between farmland capital construction and current agricultural production. Socialist large-scale agriculture requires increasingly expanded capital construction, building water conservancy, adding large-scale agricultural tools, and conducting continuous expanded reproduction to rapidly develop agriculture. Carrying out farmland capital construction is in the fundamental and long-term interests of developing agriculture. However, long-term interests must be combined with current interests. For example, although Beijing's current tasks of rushing to plant, weeding, and planting vegetables are current interests, if these tasks cannot be completed in a timely manner, it will seriously affect this year's harvest, affect this year's Great Leap Forward, and in turn affect the lives of urban and rural people, affect the development of industry and other undertakings, and affect the expanded reproduction of agriculture next year, which will in turn affect the long-term interests of agriculture and the country. Some cadres have not achieved the goal of grasping the present and the long-term, grasping the present more during the busy farming season, and grasping the long-term more during the slack farming season, so that the two are combined. We must help them learn to do this. Agricultural capital construction is a long-term task and should not be completed all at once in a short period of time. Otherwise, because the task is large, the time is long, and it occupies a lot of funds and manpower, it will disperse the strength of agriculture, weaken the strength to complete the current agricultural production, and it will be detrimental to the development of agriculture.

The above-mentioned two aspects of the contradiction are concentratedly reflected in the allocation of rural labor. Our various undertakings are developing greatly, and labor is needed everywhere, so labor is tight. In order to solve the problem of agricultural labor shortage, the fundamental method is to rapidly develop agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, improve labor productivity, and completely change the situation of most people engaging in agriculture. This is a relatively long-term task. In realizing this task, we must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs" of combining indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously engage in mass movements, and vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution. We must never value foreign methods over indigenous methods, or large methods over small methods, and completely place the task of realizing mechanization on cities sending tractors, etc. County and district industries and community-run industries should put their main strength in this area, manufacturing improved agricultural tools and undertaking repair tasks. Another method to solve the problem of agricultural labor shortage is to correctly arrange and use existing labor, eliminate unreasonable use, eliminate waste, and earnestly reflect the policy of agriculture being the foundation.

    劳力安排要贯彻以农业为主的方针
    报刊文摘
    保证农业有足够的劳动力
    农业是基础，全党全民抓农业。这是个长期的战略任务，也是当前最紧迫的中心任务。
    农业要真正成为基础，农村人民公社必须进一步加强农业生产工作。
    要加强农业这个基础，就要大大发展农业生产力，而要大大发展农业生产力，最重要的问题在于保证农业有足够的劳动力。而要保证农业有足够的劳动力，就必须做好农村人民公社内部的劳动力安排工作。那么，农村人民公社应当怎样来安排劳动力呢？
    第一，兼顾基本建设和当前生产，而以当前生产为主。任何一个人民公社，既要搞好基本建设，更要搞好当前生产。基本建设和当前生产，是矛盾的，又是统一的。说它们是矛盾的，是因为这两方面都要占用劳动力，如果在劳力上分配不适当，不是影响了这个，就是影响了那个。这一矛盾实质上是长远利益和当前利益的矛盾。说它们是统一的，是因为这两者是互为因果、相互促进的。因为搞好基本建设，便可为下年增产打下基础；而当前生产搞好了，也就更加有力量进行基本建设。但是，有一些人民公社，把过多的劳力，投入到基本建设中去，而用于当前生产的劳力，却显得不足了，甚而过分削弱了，这就势必要影响当前的生产，所以，今后的基本建设，只能是、也必须是在不影响当前生产的前提下去进行。目前，正是农事活动最繁忙、最紧张的季节，凡是因为基本建设占用劳力过多，因而影响或者可能影响当前生产的人民公社，有必要本着两者兼顾、以当前生产为主的精神，对劳力重新进行安排，把应该抽调和可能抽调的劳动力，抽调出来，补充到当前生产这个主攻战线上来。
    第二，兼顾农林牧副渔各业和农村工业、商业以及文化教育卫生事业，而以农业为主。人民公社既是一个农业、林业、牧业、副业、渔业的综合经营单位，又是一个工农商学兵的统一组织单位，它就不能不对这各个方面都兼而顾之。所有这些方面，也是既矛盾又统一的。但是，任何矛盾，都有它主导的方面。在这些矛盾中，起主导作用的是农业。这个主导的地位，不是由人们的意志决定的，而是客观事物规律性的反映。因为从这许多方面来说，只有首先搞好农业生产，才能更好地实现多种经营的方针，更好地发展社办工业、商业和文化教育卫生事业。当然，这些方面的发展，反过来又会更快地促进农业生产的发展。因此，除保证农业生产所必需的劳力之外，对这些方面也必须兼顾。一般地说，现在不是对这些方面没有兼顾，而是顾得偏多了些。对这头顾得多了，就势必对农业生产顾得少了，这不仅对农业生产不利，对实现多种经营的方针也是不利的。这种情况必须纠正。
    第三，在农业生产中，要兼顾粮食作物、经济作物和其它作物，而以粮食作物为主。在它们之间，同样是一个矛盾的统一体。从1958年大跃进以来，我们国家的粮食生产，虽然有了急剧的增长，但是，比起国家和人民日益增长的需要来，还相差很远。因为粮食问题，不仅是吃饭问题，多年来的经验证明，只有增产更多的粮食，才更有可能把包括农、林、牧、副、渔在内的整个农业生产带动起来，更好地实现农业多种经营的方针。尤其在今年这种自然灾害严重的情况下，搞好粮食生产，就更加显得重要了。因此，所有人民公社，都应该首先保证粮食的更多增产，在这个前提下，因地制宜地同时保证棉花、油料的增产，以及发展麻类、蚕丝、茶叶、糖料、蔬菜、烟叶、果品、药材、杂品等作物的生产。衡量我们是否正确地贯彻执行了这个方针的重要标志之一，就是对劳动力的安排。在粮食生产中，兼顾粮食作物、经济作物和其它作物，而以粮食作物为主的方针，是一个长时期的方针。我们不仅要在种植上重视解决这个问题，而且在田间管理上也要重视解决这个问题，在当前来说，只有加强粮食作物的田间管理工作，才能保证今年的粮食增产。
    为了保证按上述“三主”方针安排劳力，农村人民公社在劳动力的分配上必须要有一个恰当的比例。这个比例，是死比例，也是活比例。说它是死比例，就是比例一旦订出，必须按比例办事，首先使主攻战线上劳力足，不能打折扣。从当前来讲，就是要想一切办法，保证使65％以上的劳力（其中要有40％是男劳力）参加田间劳动。说它是活比例，就是这个比例可以随着农事季节的转化而改变，以适应各项生产的需要。
    但是，这并不是说每个公社，只要按“三主”安排，就可以彻底解决劳动力紧张的问题——即农业大跃进与劳动力不足的矛盾。因为劳动力所以紧张，一方面固然是由于城乡大跃进，占用了一些劳动力（如支援城市工业、发展社办工业、兴办各种集体福利事业等），使直接从事田间劳动的劳力相对减少；另一方面，更重要的是农业生产的大跃进，“八字宪法”的贯彻执行，精耕细作程度越来越高，因而所耗费的劳动量也越来越大，即使把全部农村劳力，投入生产第一线，也不能满足当前的需要。因此，农村人民公社在劳动力的安排上，既要算细账，又要算活账，客观（条件）主观（能动性）都打足，千方百计提高劳动生产率，使一个人能顶两个人、三个人做活。否则，同样是按“三主”安排劳力，也会出现两种不同的情况：一种是算死账、死算账，算来算去算住了自己，越算劳力越不足，越算困难越大，结果算成一笔泄气账，起了促退作用；另一种算活账、活算账，算来算去解放了思想，越算劳力潜力越大，越算有利条件越多，结果算成一笔鼓劲账，起了促进作用。
    解决劳动力紧张的根本出路，在于加速实现农业的技术改造。因此，各地人民公社在妥善安排劳力的同时，必须继续大搞以工具改革为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动。只有把这两方面工作都做好了，才能促进农业的持续跃进，保证农业——这个整个国民经济的基础，越来越坚实，越来越稳固。
      （摘自7月14日《山西日报》社论“‘三为主’保基础”）
    根据农业是基础的方针  解决劳动力分配的矛盾
    农业是我们工农商学兵共同进行生产和生活的基础，也是整个国民经济发展的基础。如果基础不巩固，一切事业也不会巩固；基础不发展，一切事业也不可能充分发展。大家都应该把发展农业当作自己的任务，都应该积极关心和千方百计地促进农业的发展。
    人民公社化以来，农村人民公社包括了工、农、商、学、兵，农、林、牧、副、渔多种事业，多种经营，全面发展。农村人民公社的领导，如何正确处理和安排这些事业，处理它们的相互关系，是一个重要的问题。党一再告诉我们，在农村进行多种经营的同时，要把发展农业放在首要地位。绝大多数干部和群众是这样认识和执行的，也有极少数不是这样。
    在处理农村的农业和社办工业的关系上，就有把工业摆在不恰当的位置，过多地占用了农业的劳动力，影响了农业发展的情况。发展社办工业，无疑是必要的，但是这是一个长时期的任务。而在发展社办工业时，更必须坚持社办工业首先为发展农业服务，为农村人民生活服务和为大城市服务的方针。不要把主要力量用在发展一些与发展农业无关，甚而与直接为城市服务无关的事情。那样，会削弱了农业，离开了党的农业是基础的方针。有人认为发展工业是为了追产值，追利润，觉得这样可以提高社员的收入。但是，如果农业不发展，人们没有足够的粮食，工业没有足够的原料，不能生产足够的日用工业品，社员实际也得不到什么好处。更重要的是，如果因为缺少粮食和其他工业原料，城市的轻重工业不能发展，农村还会因为得不到机器设备更加不能发展，对于农民的长远利益很不利。在安排农村的农、林、牧、副、渔的关系上也是如此。除了以林、牧、副、渔收入为主的地区外，农村人民公社如果不是以农业为主去大力发展农业生产，丢了农业，也会丢掉其他，最后一定会招致不良的后果。有少数干部和群众不把农业放在重要的地位，轻视农业，不安于踏踏实实和积极地发展农业，不是在积极发展农业中去提高农村人民生活。这是有害的，也是旧社会轻视农业劳动的资产阶级思想残余，在一部分干部和群众中的反映。对于这种有害的思想，必须认真展开辩论，澄清认识，彻底克服。目前，我们的农业劳动生产率还低，为了夺取收成，还不得不花费较多的劳动。面对这样的情况，农村的干部和群众应该奋发起来，努力改变农业落后的状况，实现农业的技术改造，提高劳动生产率。农业在什么时候也是国民经济不可缺少的重要的物质生产部门，努力发展农业，为全国人民提供日益丰富的粮食和工业原料，是全体农村干部和群众的极其光荣的任务。
    发展农业，还需要正确处理农田基本建设和当前农业生产的关系。社会主义的大农业，要求有日益扩大的基本建设，兴建水利，添置大型农具，进行不断扩大的再生产，高速地发展农业。进行农田基本建设，这是发展农业的根本利益和长远利益。但是，长远利益必须和目前利益相结合。例如，当前北京市的抢种、锄草和种菜的任务，虽然是目前的利益，但是这些活茬如果不能及时完成，就会严重地影响今年的收获，影响今年的大跃进，并进而影响城乡人民的生活，影响工业和其他事业的发展，影响明年农业的扩大再生产，结果又影响了农业和国家的长远利益。有些干部没有作到既抓当前又抓长远，农忙多抓当前，农闲多抓长远，使两者结合起来。我们必须帮助他们学会这样做。农业的基本建设，是较长期的任务，不要急于在一个短时间内全部完成它。不然，就会因为任务大，时间长，占用资金人力多，分散了农业的力量，削弱了完成当前农业生产的力量，对于发展农业反而不利。
    上述两方面的矛盾，集中反映在农村劳动力的分配上面。我们的各项事业都在大发展，到处都需要劳动力，因此，劳动力是紧张的。为了解决农业劳动力紧张的问题，根本的方法是迅速发展农业的机械化、水利化、电气化，提高劳动生产率，彻底改变用绝大多数人搞农业的局面。这是一个比较长远的任务。在实现这个任务中，要坚决贯彻土洋并举“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命。决不能重洋轻土，重大轻小，把实现机械化的任务完全放在城市送来拖拉机等上面。县区工业、社办工业应该把主要力量放在这方面，制造改良农具，担负修理任务。解决农业劳动力紧张问题的另一方法，是正确地安排和使用现有的劳动力，消灭不合理使用的现象，消灭浪费，认真体现农业是基础的方针。
