Xinhua News Agency, July 5th. According to the diagnosis by the Tjimahi Army Hospital in Indonesia on the body of Ye Jinniang, the wife of overseas Chinese Lin Yu, who was shot and killed by military police dispatched by the West Java military authorities on July 3rd, there were seven bullet wounds on Ye Jinniang's body.

The diagnosis stated that Ye Jinniang was 45 years old and was shot on the 3rd at 6:45 AM. She was brought to the army hospital's morgue at 7:45 AM. The bullet wounds on her body were: two in the abdomen, two in the breasts, one in the shoulder, one in the navel, and one below the right breast.

Although an examination was also conducted on the body of another overseas Chinese woman, Yang Mumei, who was also killed by military police of the West Java military authorities on the same day, Indonesian authorities refused to sign the diagnosis. Local overseas Chinese are extremely indignant about this and demand that the body be transported to Bandung for examination.

As previously reported, Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang were both innocent victims killed in the recent second large-scale forced eviction of overseas Chinese launched by the West Java military authorities. After Yang Mumei was killed on the morning of July 3rd, local military police, in order to cover up their murder, seized Yang Mumei's body.

    西爪哇军警罪行确凿
    叶金娘身上有七处弹痕
    新华社5日讯　据印度尼西亚芝马圩陆军医院对7月3日被西爪哇军事当局派出的军警开枪杀害的华侨林玉的妻子叶金娘的尸体的诊断结果，叶金娘的身上有七处弹痕。
    诊断书说，叶金娘四十五岁，3日六时四十五分被枪杀。七时四十五分被抬入陆军医院死人房。她身上的弹痕有：腹部两处，乳房两处，肩膀一处，脐部一处，右乳房下部一处。
    同一天被西爪哇军事当局的军警杀害的另一名华侨妇女杨木妹的尸体虽经检验，但印度尼西亚有关方面拒绝签署诊断书。当地华侨对此异常愤慨，他们要求把尸体运往万隆检验。
    前已报道，杨木妹和叶金娘都是在西爪哇军事当局最近发动的第二次大规模逼迁华侨的活动中被无辜杀害的。杨木妹在7月3日上午被杀害以后，当地军警为了掩盖杀人的罪迹，曾将杨木妹的尸体抢走。
