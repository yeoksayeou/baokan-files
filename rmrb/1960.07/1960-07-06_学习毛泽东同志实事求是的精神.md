Comrades, the Chinese Communist Party has now been established for thirty-nine years. During these thirty-nine years, our Party once took a tortuous road for a considerable period. It was not until after 1935, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, that we won the great victories of the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction, stage by stage. These victories are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. From this, we draw a definite conclusion: to further develop the victories we have already achieved, accelerate socialist construction, and do all our work well, we must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought and act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

All discoveries of truth are the result of seeking truth from facts; Comrade Mao Zedong adheres to the principle of seeking truth from facts in dealing with all problems, and thus he has developed Marxism-Leninism in all aspects.

To study Mao Zedong Thought is to study how he combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and how he developed Marxism-Leninism as a result. Comrade Mao Zedong's entire body of doctrine, including philosophy, political economy, scientific socialism, as well as military affairs, Party building, culture, and other aspects, has developed Marxism-Leninism. The reason he was able to do so is because he adhered to the attitude of seeking truth from facts in dealing with all problems. Therefore, if we want to act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we must learn his spirit of seeking truth from facts.

Seeking truth from facts, as explained by Comrade Mao Zedong, means that "'facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, their regularity, and 'seeking' is our research." That is to say, to make our subjective understanding correctly reflect the objective reality and deeply understand objective truth, we must work in accordance with the attitude of seeking truth from facts.

Facts prove that all discoveries of truth are the result of seeking truth from facts, and are true reflections of objective conditions in people's minds. Marx and Engels, based on the basic contradictions of capitalist society and the development of class struggle, discovered the law that socialism will inevitably replace capitalism, and derived the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, turning socialist thought from utopianism into science. After capitalism developed to the stage of imperialism, Lenin, based on the law of uneven political and economic development of capitalist countries, concluded that socialism could first achieve victory in several or one country, thus developing the theory of proletarian socialist revolution. In short, the truths they discovered were the result of seeking truth from facts. In Marx's words, it was by thoroughly occupying a large amount of material and conducting scientific analysis and comprehensive research; in Lenin's words, it was by concretely analyzing concrete situations. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the principles of Marx and Lenin, expressed it in the Chinese idiom "seeking truth from facts," which makes it even easier for us to understand.

Comrade Mao Zedong is a model of contemporary adherence to the principle of seeking truth from facts in handling major policies. In all his theoretical activities and revolutionary practice, he always proceeded from the actual situation of objective existence, found out its inherent regularity, and used it as a guide for our actions. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the political and economic conditions of various classes in Chinese society, pointed out the objects and driving forces of the revolution, and particularly emphasized the issue of the peasant allies, thus pointing out the direction of the Chinese revolution. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the characteristics of China's vast territory, uneven political and economic development, and the division of spheres of influence by imperialism, made the conclusion that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," thus dispelling doubts about "how long the Red Flag can last" and developing the revolutionary base areas. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were two erroneous views: "national subjugation theory" and "quick victory theory." Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves, the support of the people, and international assistance, pointed out the protracted nature of the war and the inevitability of final victory, and formulated a complete set of strategies and tactics, enhancing the confidence and strength of the people in the armed struggle against Japan, thereby achieving the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the Liberation War, a considerable number of people lacked a sufficient understanding of the peace conspiracy of the US-Chiang clique, or feared the strength of the US-Chiang military forces. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the historical characteristics of the US-Chiang reactionaries, and based on the people's strong desire to defend the fruits of victory, proposed the policy of "tit-for-tat struggle, contending for every inch of land," pointing out the inevitable result of the enemy's defeat and our victory, thereby clearing everyone's minds and enhancing their confidence in the struggle. After the victory of the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the fact that the main contradiction in our country had shifted to the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, while also considering the existence of a vast individual agriculture and handicrafts, a considerable proportion of capitalist industry and commerce, and the extremely backward level of economic development in our country, formulated the general line for the transition period, namely, the general line of simultaneously undertaking socialist revolution and socialist construction. On the issue of the socialist transformation of agriculture, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the changes in the rural class situation after the land reform, analyzed the differences between the new and old upper-middle peasants and lower-middle peasants in the middle peasant stratum, thus expanding the scope of reliance, establishing the leading advantage of the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and enabling the cooperative movement to develop rapidly and healthily, achieving agricultural collectivization without mechanization. On the issue of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the characteristics of capitalist industry and commerce in our country, which had both beneficial and unfavorable aspects for the national economy and people's livelihood in a certain period, adopted the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation, thereby promoting production development and accelerating the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. After the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means production was basically completed, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the fact that the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie still existed, and would stir up trouble at every opportunity, proposed that the socialist revolution be carried through to the end on the political and ideological fronts. After the socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the changes in the relations of production and the superstructure, the great liberation of labor power, the further enhancement of the awareness of the broad masses, and the urgent desire to change the state of "poverty and blankness," formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, on the basis of summing up the experience of socialist construction in our country and referring to foreign experiences. Under the guidance of the general line, the development of production and construction showed a high speed of the Great Leap Forward. At this time, the original advanced cooperatives were no longer adapted to the needs of production development, and the prototypes of people's communes appeared in many places. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on this situation, summarized the creations of the masses and pointed out that the people's commune is the best form for accelerating socialist construction and transitioning to communism in the future. Now, facts have fully proven that these three magic weapons correctly reflect the objective laws of socialist construction and centrally embody the strong aspirations and great strength of the people of the whole country. All of these are the latest crystallizations of Comrade Mao Zedong's "seeking truth from facts," and also a major development of Marxism-Leninism.

In the history of our Party, there have been some people who went against the spirit of seeking truth from facts. They were self-righteous, arrogant, and subjective in viewing problems, and made serious opportunist errors of either the right or the "left," causing major losses to the revolution. In particular, Wang Ming's "left" leaning opportunist errors caused extremely serious losses to the Chinese revolution. If the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong had not defeated and replaced the erroneous line of opportunism, and allowed the leadership of opportunism to continue to develop, the victory of our country's revolutionary cause would have been unimaginable. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Subjective analysis of the political situation and subjective guidance of work will inevitably result in either opportunism or adventurism." Therefore, if we want to avoid making "left" or right errors in our actual work and ensure the implementation of the Party's correct line, the only way is to learn Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of seeking truth from facts.

Learn Comrade Mao Zedong's realistic working attitude and methods

To learn Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of seeking truth from facts, we must also learn his realistic working attitude and methods. Otherwise, seeking truth from facts will still become a formality and an empty phrase. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's constant teachings, we believe that to meet the requirements of seeking truth from facts, the following points must be achieved:

First, have an honest attitude.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Marxism-Leninism is science, and science is a very honest subject, and even a little bit of mischief is not allowed." Therefore, to be realistic in dealing with problems, we must first have an honest attitude.

An honest attitude is a materialistic attitude, that is, to reflect objective things truthfully, one is one, two is two, without concealing or exaggerating, and to understand it according to its original appearance. Because all things exist objectively and do not shift with people's will, only by adopting an honest attitude can we reflect its true situation and draw correct conclusions from it. If we do not adopt an honest attitude, are self-righteous, put on airs, engage in speculation and trickery, and falsify, we will distort the facts and distort Marxism-Leninism. For example, some people, holding bourgeois pacifist views, put lipstick on imperialism and its culprits, saying that imperialism also "hopes for peace" and that Eisenhower is a "messenger of peace," etc., which is a distortion of the facts. Also, some people criticize our country's socialist construction, saying that large-scale steelmaking is "not worth the loss," that people's communes were "established too early and messed up," that the masses' soaring enthusiasm is "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," etc. These are attempts to exaggerate the shortcomings of one finger to negate the achievements of nine fingers, which are ulterior motives and are not honest attitudes. If we act according to the ideas of these people, we will ruin the revolutionary cause.

We must advocate an honest attitude and oppose a dishonest attitude. In our work, we must always study problems and handle problems with an honest attitude. To achieve this, we must have a firm proletarian stand. If we proceed from individualism, from localism, and from all non-proletarian stands, we will not dare to face the facts or the truth, and we will not have an honest attitude; only by standing on the proletarian stand can we dare to face the facts and the truth, have an honest attitude, and be able to seek truth from facts.

Second, strengthen investigation and research.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak," and also said: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in understanding the situation and grasping policies. The former is the so-called knowing the world, and the latter is the so-called transforming the world." To do these two things well, we must conduct investigation and research regularly and in a planned manner. Because only through serious investigation and research can we be realistic and find the laws of development of things. Now, no one denies the importance of investigation and research, and the investigation and research work in various places and departments has been greatly strengthened. However, there are still a few people who do not conduct investigation and research, and are only satisfied with the work reports, statistics, and telephone reports from below; or although they conduct investigation and research, their purpose is not clear, and the materials are not deep and thorough, which is formalistic investigation and research, and cannot meet the needs of guiding the work. These situations must be thoroughly changed.

Comrade Mao Zedong has always paid the most attention to investigation and research. In the "Preface and Postscript to Rural Surveys" and "Reform Our Study" and other works, he made many valuable instructions on investigation and research. We must earnestly study these works, master the basic methods of investigation and research, and learn to conduct investigation and research. To do a good job in investigation and research, first of all, we must master the method of class analysis, which is the soul of investigation and research work. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "For those who are responsible for guiding the work, it is the most basic method to understand the situation to plan to grasp a few cities and a few villages, and use the basic viewpoints of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis, to conduct several thorough investigations." We know that as long as class struggle still exists, people's views on problems are all marked with the brand of class. As the masses say: "What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what class speaks what kind of words." If we do not master the method of class analysis, and do not pay attention to investigating the dynamics of various classes, it is impossible to reflect the real situation, and we will lose our way in the storm of class struggle. Only by mastering the method of class analysis, constantly understanding the situation of various classes and their interrelationships, and carefully identifying the different reflections of people from different classes, can we discover the truth, see the situation clearly, promote the growth of new things, and withstand various evil winds and evil spirits in the investigation. Secondly, we must have the determination to be a pupil. Comrade Mao Zedong said when discussing investigation and research: "Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downward, without the desire for knowledge, without putting down the stinky airs, and the spirit of being a pupil, it is impossible to do it, and it is impossible to do it well." If we want to do a good job in investigation and research, we must get rid of baggage, not be complacent, not put on airs, and mingle with the masses, so that we can confide in each other, talk about everything, and listen to opinions from all sides extensively, so as to achieve the effect of "listening to both sides and being clear." One of the important reasons why some people's investigation and research is always not deep and thorough is that they lack the spirit of learning from the masses. They carry the burden of self-righteousness to conduct investigation and research, and only collect some materials that are subjectively needed to verify the conclusions they have made in advance, so of course it is impossible to get useful knowledge. Thirdly, we must combine "getting off the horse to watch the flowers" and "riding on horseback to watch the flowers." "Getting off the horse to watch the flowers" means "dissecting the sparrow." Its advantage is that it can deeply understand the situation and analyze problems; "riding on horseback to watch the flowers" means conducting a general investigation, and its advantage is that it can understand the overall outline and observe the trends. We should combine these two methods well, but we should pay special attention to doing a good job of "dissecting the sparrow," because although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. As long as we dissect one or several, we can draw inferences from one instance to understand the whole situation from one point. Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached importance to the work of "dissecting the sparrow." His method of "dissecting the sparrow" is to hold investigation meetings, find people who are most familiar with the situation to participate in the meeting, and discuss the issues one by one based on the investigation outline. We must learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's example, often go deep into the lower levels, do more work of dissecting the sparrow, so as to understand the specific situation and make our work more solid and meticulous.

Third, have scientific analysis and thinking.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Rough investigation and research can discover problems and raise problems. But it cannot solve problems. To solve problems, we must also do systematic and thorough investigation and research work, which is the process of analysis... Often the problem is raised, but it cannot be solved, because the internal connections of things have not been exposed, because it has not gone through this systematic and thorough analysis process, so the face of the problem is not clear, and we cannot do comprehensive work, so we cannot solve the problem well." Therefore, we must not only conduct general investigation and research, but also conduct scientific analysis and thinking. Only in this way can we grasp the essence of things from a large amount of material and find out the laws of things.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "Learning and the Situation" written in 1944: "To remove the strong blindness in our Party, we must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and develop the habit of analysis." From the habit of analysis, many of our cadres have not reached this requirement. They are only satisfied with general investigation and research, and do not pay attention to analysis and thinking. Although they are active and hardworking in their work, they do not pay attention to finding out the laws, so their work efficiency is not high. We must develop the habit of analysis and think hard about everything. Often grasp a few major problems and keep them in mind and think about them repeatedly. For complex problems, we must have the spirit of getting to the bottom of things, thinking about them clearly and thoroughly. Only by constantly training like this can we improve our ability to analyze and think. From the method of analysis, the difference is even greater, so we must learn the method of analyzing problems even more. We must know that if the method is correct, we will come to the correct conclusion; if the method is not correct, we will make mistakes. How can we master the method of analyzing things? The only way is to learn materialist dialectics. Materialist dialectics is our microscope and telescope for observing things. By mastering this magic weapon, we can avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong can see deeply and far, and can have a high degree of scientific foresight, is because he can skillfully use this magic weapon. We must always learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's example of using materialist dialectics, remove blindness, enhance consciousness, and be able to think more and make good decisions.

Fourth, constantly improve in practice.

Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "The knowledge of the regularity of the world that has been grasped must be returned to the practice of transforming the world... This is the process of testing and developing theory, and it is the continuation of the entire process of knowledge." This means that the process of seeking truth from facts is the process of combining knowing the world and transforming the world, and it is the process of combining theory and practice. Whether the views we have obtained through investigation and research and analysis and thinking are in line with reality can only be affirmed after being tested in practice; especially for some complex problems, we can only truly understand its regularity after we have gained direct experience in practice. Therefore, to achieve seeking truth from facts, we cannot ignore participating in the practice of changing reality for a moment. Only by personally participating in the practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiments can we more deeply and correctly understand the objective world. The so-called theory comes from practice is the same reason.

Practice is not only the criterion for testing right and wrong, but also the source for enriching and developing the truth. People's understanding of objective laws can only be gradually developed and improved due to the limitations of many conditions. The most fundamental way to make our understanding more and more perfect is through practice, because only in practice can we gain experience and improve our understanding. The formation and development of the Party's general line for socialist construction is a typical example. As early as 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the slogan of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in 1956 he made a report on the "Ten Major Relationships," which stipulated a series of major policies for carrying out socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In May 1958, at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism was formally formulated. After two years of Great Leap Forward practice in 1958 and 1959, not only was the correctness of the Party's general line fully proved, but the content of the general line was further enriched. For example, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward, further developed a series of "walking on two legs" policies on the basis of several parallel development; in terms of the relationship between industry and agriculture, the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, taking industry as the leading factor, and combining the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture was put forward, etc.

Comrade Mao Zedong once summarized the law of cognition in this way: "To discover the truth through practice, and then to verify and develop the truth through practice. To actively develop from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and then to actively guide revolutionary practice from rational knowledge, to transform the subjective world and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, re-practice, and re-knowledge, this form repeats itself endlessly, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge is relatively advanced to a higher degree." This means that the development of objective things is endless, and "seeking truth" is also endless. We must constantly investigate and research, analyze and think, and summarize and improve in practice, so that our subjective understanding conforms to the ever-changing objective reality, and constantly push our work forward.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work": "For the theory of Marxism, we must be able to master it, apply it, and the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." The purpose of our study of Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of seeking truth from facts is also the same: not only to understand it, but more importantly to be able to apply it. Of course, important policies and policy issues are formulated by the Party Central Committee in a timely and correct manner, but to fully implement the policies and tasks assigned by the higher authorities, we also need to find out the specific laws of specific things with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, because if we don't do so, we may take detours. From this point of view, in order to realize the central government's policy of developing agricultural production in agriculture, we have systematically investigated the characteristics of Anhui, and repeatedly experimented with crop cultivation. In 1953, we proposed three reform measures for agricultural production; later, we constantly summed up experience, and based on changes in objective conditions and the improvement of subjective understanding, we constantly enriched and developed it, which played a considerable role in ensuring the high-speed development of agricultural production in Anhui Province. For example, on the issue of water control, in order to realize the task of "we must repair the Huai River well," we investigated the situation of the Huai River basin, summed up the experience of water control, and proposed the water control methods of "believing in the masses, relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, with large and medium-sized projects supporting, focusing on storage, minimizing drainage, and making it a river network and rice-based system." Practice has proved that this method is also in line with the actual situation. Especially in the test of two years of severe drought, its effectiveness has been significantly demonstrated. In industry, when we vigorously developed steel in 1958, according to the policy of developing large, medium, and small-scale projects simultaneously, and according to the conditions of Anhui Province, we vigorously developed the "small-scale foreign-style" steel base, which quickly laid the foundation for steel production in Anhui Province, achieved the requirements of high yield and high quality, and maintained high-speed development. Subsequently, we applied the experience of the "small-scale foreign-style" to machinery, coal, chemical, light industry, and other aspects, and achieved good results. These effects are derived from learning and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of seeking truth from facts. But it must also be seen that not everything is done well, not everything is carried out in accordance with the principle of seeking truth from facts, especially some new things that we still need to understand its regularity and find effective ways. Therefore, we must further adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts in all our work. Not only should industrial and agricultural production be realistic, but also financial and trade, culture and education, science, life welfare, sports and health, as well as political and legal work should be realistic; not only should the leaders of higher-level agencies be realistic, but the leaders of grassroots organizations and all cadres of all levels of agencies should also be realistic; not only should we be realistic when studying and formulating policies, but also when implementing policies; not only should big problems be realistic, but small problems should also be realistic. In short, all departments, all units, and all cadres should fully develop the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and do their work more carefully, more solidly, and more comprehensively, because only in this way can we avoid making mistakes or make fewer mistakes, and make various tasks develop both rapidly and healthily.

In order to better implement and apply the principle of seeking truth from facts and overcome ideological obstacles, we should pay attention to criticizing the following one-sided views and erroneous attitudes based on past experience.

Seeking truth from facts is to better go all out; only seeking truth from facts can we better dare to think and dare to act

Some people think that to be realistic, we cannot go all out. This view is completely wrong. Seeking truth from facts is to go all out; and only by going all out can we be realistic. The problem is very obvious: if we do not proceed from reality and work blindly, the enthusiasm of the masses will not be aroused. To go all out and maintain a strong enthusiasm, only by realistically combining the objectively permissible conditions with subjective efforts, and combining work and rest, can it be possible. Similarly, if we do not have enough enthusiasm, are content with being in the middle reaches, and do not strive to achieve things that can be achieved, making our thoughts and actions lag behind the objective reality, we will violate the requirements of seeking truth from facts. "Seeking truth" itself contains going all out. Without sufficient enthusiasm, it is impossible to "seek" the "truth." The argument that seeking truth from facts cannot go all out is essentially a cover for one's own right-leaning conservative thoughts or reckless thoughts.

Some people think that seeking truth from facts cannot dare to think and dare to act. This is also wrong. Our understanding is the opposite of theirs. We believe that only by daring to think and dare to act can we better seek truth from facts, and only by seeking truth from facts can we better dare to think and dare to act. Because only by daring to think and dare to act can we break superstition, and only by breaking superstition can we be realistic. Because seeking truth from facts is to find out the laws of things. The more deeply the laws of things are understood, the more boldly we can dare to think and dare to act. As the old saying goes: "If you are justified, you are confident," which is the same reason. Therefore, the statement that seeking truth from facts cannot dare to think and dare to act is actually just an excuse for not daring to liberate the mind or not willing to use the brain.

Right-leaning opportunists use the excuse of seeking truth from facts to exaggerate shortcomings and deny achievements. They proclaim that to be realistic, we must be perfect, otherwise it is "not seeking truth from facts." These people are actually careerists. Their means are "attacking one point without considering the rest," and their purpose is to deny the overall achievements from individual shortcomings, deny the correct leadership of the Party, and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. We must resolutely criticize and struggle against such ulterior motives. Everyone must understand that it takes a process to truly seek out the complete "truth" from reality, so it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings in the work. However, under the guidance of the Party's correct line, achievements are always the main thing, and shortcomings are only secondary. There is always a relationship of nine fingers and one finger between them. However, we never neglect the shortcomings just because they are inevitable and a matter of one finger. Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us to affirm achievements and overcome shortcomings. He pointed out in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "We cannot ignore the non-essential aspects and non-mainstream aspects of the problem, and we must solve them one by one." "Solve the problem as soon as there is one, and don't wait for the problem to become a pile before making a general solution." Now, there are indeed some individual cadres who have forgotten Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and ignore the problem of one finger, which is not allowed and must be corrected in a practical way. However, we correct shortcomings in order to better carry forward achievements, not to deny achievements, which is completely different from the views of opportunists.

The thirty-nine years that our Party has experienced are thirty-nine years of continuous revolution and continuous victory, and are thirty-nine years in which Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly and penetrates the hearts of the people. Now, we have entered a new stage of sustained leap forward in socialist construction, and arduous construction tasks need us to complete, and many new problems are waiting for us to solve. In commemorating the Party's birthday under such new circumstances and new tasks, we must more earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, strive to improve our level of political theory, constantly improve our way of thinking and working methods, overcome one-sided views, establish comprehensive views, combine cold and hot well, combine daring to think and act with seeking truth from facts, combine learning and originality well, and combine despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically well. Now the situation in all aspects is extremely good. As long as we hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and better carry forward the Party's fine tradition of seeking truth from facts, we will surely be able to move from victory to greater victory forever in the struggle for the cause of socialism and communism!

    学习毛泽东同志实事求是的精神
    中共安徽省委第一书记　曾希圣
    中国共产党从成立到现在，已经三十九个年头了。在这三十九年中，我们党曾经在相当长的一个时期内，走了一段曲折的道路，直到1935年以后，在以毛泽东同志为首的中央的正确领导下，才一个阶段又一个阶段地赢得了民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。这些胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。从这里得出了一个肯定的结论：要进一步发展我们已经取得的胜利，加速建设社会主义，做好一切工作，就必须认真学习毛泽东思想，按照毛泽东思想办事。
    一切真理的发现，都是实事求是的结果；毛泽东同志对待一切问题都坚持实事求是的原则，因而他从各个方面发展了马克思列宁主义
    学习毛泽东思想，就是要学习他如何把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，又如何从而发展马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志的全部学说，包括哲学、政治经济学、科学社会主义以及军事、建党、文化等各个方面，都发展了马克思列宁主义。他所以能够如此，就因为他在对待一切问题上，都坚持着实事求是的态度。因此，如果我们想要按照毛泽东思想办事，就必须学习他的实事求是的精神。
    实事求是，按照毛泽东同志的解释：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”这就是说，要使我们的主观正确地反映客观，深刻认识客观真理，就必须按照实事求是的态度来进行工作。
    事实证明，一切真理的发现都是实事求是的结果，都是客观情况对于人们头脑的真实反映。马克思、恩格斯根据资本主义社会的基本矛盾和阶级斗争的发展情况，发现了社会主义必然代替资本主义的规律，得出了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，使社会主义思潮由空想变成了科学。在资本主义发展到帝国主义阶段以后，列宁根据资本主义各国政治、经济发展不平衡的规律，得出了社会主义可能首先在数国或一国取得胜利的结论，从而发展了无产阶级社会主义革命的理论。总而言之，他们所发现的真理都是实事求是得来的结果，按照马克思的说法是，详细地占有大量材料，加以科学分析和综合研究；按照列宁的说法是，具体地分析具体情况。毛泽东同志根据马克思和列宁的原则，用中国成语“实事求是”四个字把它表达出来，就更加使我们易于理解了。
    毛泽东同志是当代最遵守实事求是的原则来处理大政方针的典范，在他的全部理论活动和革命实践中，都是从客观存在着的实际情况出发，找出其固有的规律性，作为我们行动的向导。在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志根据中国社会各阶级的政治、经济情况，指出了革命的对象和动力，并特别强调地提出了农民同盟军的问题，从而指出了中国革命的方向。在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志根据中国幅员辽阔、政治经济发展不平衡、帝国主义分割势力范围等特点，作出了“星星之火，可以燎原”的结论，从而打破了“红旗到底打得多久”的疑问，发展了革命根据地。在抗日战争时期，曾经有过“亡国论”和“速胜论”两种错误观点。毛泽东同志根据敌我力量的对比、人心的向背以及国际援助等情况，指出了战争的持久性和最后胜利的必然性，并且制定了一套完整的战略、战术，增强了全国人民抗日武装斗争的信心和力量，从而取得了抗日战争的最后胜利。在解放战争时期，曾经有相当一部分人对美蒋的和平阴谋认识不足，或者害怕美蒋军事力量的强大；毛泽东同志又根据美蒋反动派的历史特点，根据人民要求保卫胜利果实的强烈愿望，提出了“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针，指出了敌败我胜的必然结果，从而使大家清醒了头脑，提高了斗争信心。民主革命胜利以后，毛泽东同志根据我国国内的主要矛盾已经转变为工人阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义的矛盾，同时又考虑到当时存在着广大的个体的农业和手工业，占相当比重的资本主义工商业，以及我国的经济发展水平还极为落后等等情况，制定了过渡时期的总路线，即社会主义革命和社会主义建设同时并举的总路线。在农业的社会主义改造问题上，毛泽东同志根据土地改革以后农村阶级情况的变化，分析了中农阶层中的新老上、下中农的区别，这样就扩大了依靠对象，树立了贫农和下中农的领导优势，从而使合作化运动得以迅速地健康地发展，在没有机械化的条件下，实现了农业合作化。在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的问题上，毛泽东同志根据我国资本主义工商业在一定时期对国计民生既有有利的一面又有不利的一面的特点，采取了利用、限制和改造的政策，从而促进了生产发展并加速了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在基本上完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造以后，毛泽东同志根据资产阶级的政治思想影响仍然存在，而且一有机会就兴风作浪的情况，提出了要在政治战线和思想战线上把社会主义革命进行到底。在社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利以后，毛泽东同志根据生产关系和上层建筑的改变，劳动力大大解放，根据广大群众的觉悟进一步提高，和改变“一穷二白”的迫切要求，在总结我国社会主义建设经验和参照外国经验的基础上，制定了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在总路线的指引下，生产建设的发展出现了大跃进的高速度。这时原来的高级社已不适应生产发展的需要，许多地方出现了人民公社的雏形。毛泽东同志根据这一情况，总结了群众的创造，指出人民公社是加速社会主义建设并在将来向共产主义过渡的最好形式。现在事实已经充分证明，这三个法宝，正确地反映了社会主义建设的客观规律，集中地体现了全国人民的强烈愿望和伟大力量。所有这些，都是毛泽东同志“实事求是”的最新结晶，也是对马克思列宁主义的重大发展。
    在我们党的历史上，曾有一些人和实事求是的精神相反，他们处处自以为是，自高自大，主观主义地看待问题，犯了严重的或右或“左”的机会主义错误，使革命受到了重大损失。特别是王明的“左”倾机会主义错误，使中国革命受到了极为严重的损失。如果没有以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线来战胜和代替机会主义的错误路线，而让机会主义的领导继续发展下去，我国革命事业的胜利是不可想像的。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导，其必然的结果，不是机会主义，就是盲动主义”。因此我们在实际工作中要想不犯或“左”或右的错误，保证党的正确路线的贯彻执行，唯一途径就是学会毛泽东同志的实事求是精神。
    学习毛泽东同志实事求是的工作态度和工作方法
    要学习毛泽东同志实事求是的精神，还必须学习他实事求是的工作态度和工作方法。否则实事求是仍然会流于形式而成为一句空话。根据毛泽东同志的不断教导，我们认为要达到实事求是的要求，必须做到以下几点：
    第一，要有老实态度。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“马克思列宁主义是科学，科学是老老实实的学问，任何一点调皮都是不行的。”因此要做到实事求是地对待问题，首先要有老实态度。
    老实态度就是唯物主义的态度，就是如实地反映客观事物，有一是一，有二是二，不掩饰，不夸大，按照它的本来面目去了解它。因为一切事物都是客观存在的，不以人们的意志为转移的，只有采取老实态度，才能反映出它的真实情况，从中得出正确的结论。如果不采取老实的态度，自以为是，装腔作势，投机取巧，弄虚作假，就会歪曲事实，歪曲马克思列宁主义。譬如，有些人抱着资产阶级的和平主义观点，替帝国主义及其罪魁涂脂抹粉，说帝国主义也“希望和平”，艾森豪威尔是“和平的使者”，等等，这就是歪曲事实。又如，有些人非难我国的社会主义建设，说什么大办钢铁是“得不偿失”，人民公社“办早了，办糟了”，群众的冲天干劲是“小资产阶级的狂热性”等等，这是企图夸大一个指头的缺点来否定九个指头的成绩的问题，是别有用心的，都不是老实态度。如果按照这些人的思想办事，就会葬送革命事业。
    我们必须提倡老实态度，反对不老实的态度。在我们的工作中，时时刻刻都要抱着老实态度去研究问题、处理问题。要做到这一点，就要有坚定的无产阶级的立场。如果从个人主义出发，从本位主义出发，从一切非无产阶级的立场出发，就不敢面对事实，面对真理，就不会有老实态度；只有站在无产阶级的立场上，才敢面对事实，面对真理，才会有老实态度，才有可能做到实事求是。
    第二，要加强调查研究。
    毛泽东同志一再强调：“没有调查就没有发言权”，又说：
  “共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”要做好这两件事，就必须经常地有计划地进行调查研究。因为只有认真调查研究，才能做到实事求是，才能找到事物发展的规律。现在，对于调查研究的重要性是谁也不否认的了，各地、各部门的调查研究工作都有了很大的加强。但是，也还有少数人不做调查研究，只满足于下面的工作报告、统计数字和电话汇报；或者虽然搞调查研究，但目的性不明确，材料搞得不深不透，是形式主义的调查研究，不能满足指导工作的需要。这些情况都必须彻底加以改变。
    毛泽东同志一向是最注意调查研究的，在“《农村调查》的序言和跋”以及《改造我们的学习》等著作中，对调查研究作了许多宝贵的指示，我们要认真地学习这些著作，掌握调查研究的基本方法，学会调查研究。要搞好调查研究，首先，要掌握阶级分析的方法，这是调查研究工作的灵魂。毛泽东同志说过：“对于担负指导工作的人来说，有计划地抓住几个城市、几个乡村，用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，作几次周密的调查，乃是了解情况的最基本的方法。”我们知道，只要还存在阶级斗争，人们对问题的看法，就无不打着阶级的烙印。正如群众所说：“什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。”如果不掌握阶级分析的方法，不注意调查各个阶级的动态，就不可能反映真实情况，就会在阶级斗争的风浪中迷失方向。只有掌握了阶级分析的方法，经常了解各个阶级的情况以及他们的相互关系，认真识别不同阶级的人们的不同反映，才能在调查中发现真理，看清形势，促进新生事物的成长，顶住各种歪风邪气。其次，要有甘当小学生的决心。毛泽东同志在论述调查研究的时候说过：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子，甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”我们要搞好调查研究，就必须丢掉包袱，不自满，不摆架子，和群众打成一片，做到互相推心置腹，无所不谈，广泛听取各方面的意见，以收“兼听则明”的效果。有些人对调查研究总是搞得不深不透，重要原因之一，就是缺乏向群众学习的精神。他们背着自以为是的包袱去调查研究，专门搜集一些主观上所需要的材料来印证自己事前已作好的结论，这样当然就不可能得到有用的知识。再次，要把“下马观花”和“走马观花”结合起来。“下马观花”就是“解剖麻雀”，它的好处是能够深入地了解情况，分析问题；“走马观花”就是进行大略的调查，它的好处是能够了解全面轮廓，观察动向。我们应该把这两种方法很好地结合起来，但要特别注意做好“解剖麻雀”的工作，因为麻雀虽小，五脏俱全，只要解剖一只或几只，就能举一反三，从一点了解全面。毛泽东同志一向重视“解剖麻雀”的工作，他的“解剖麻雀”的办法就是开调查会，找最熟悉情况的人参加会议，根据调查纲目边谈边议。把问题一个一个地搞清楚。我们一定要学习毛泽东同志的榜样，经常深入下层，多做一些解剖麻雀的工作，以便了解具体情况，使我们的工作做得更加踏实细致。
    第三，要有科学的分析思考。
    毛泽东同志说过：“大略的调查和研究可以发现问题，提出问题。但是还不能解决问题。要解决问题，还须作系统的周密的调查工作和研究工作，这就是分析的过程，……常常问题是提出了，但还不能解决，就是因为还没有暴露事物的内部联系，就是因为还没有经过这种系统的周密的分析过程，因而问题的面貌还不明晰，还不能做综合工作，也就不能好好地解决问题。”所以，我们不但要进行一般的调查研究，还要进行科学的分析思考。只有这样，才能从大量的材料中抓住事物的本质，摸清事物的规律。
    毛泽东同志在1944年写的《学习和时局》一文中曾经指出：“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”从分析习惯说，我们还有不少干部没有达到这个要求。他们只满足于一般的调查研究，不注意分析思考。他们在工作中，虽然积极苦干，但不注意摸规律，所以工作效率不高。我们一定要养成分析的习惯，遇事多想苦想。经常抓住几个主要问题，放在脑子里翻来复去地想。对于复杂问题，更要有打破砂锅问到底的精神，把它想清想透，只有这样经常的磨练，才能提高我们分析思考的能力。从分析方法说，则相差更远，所以我们更加要学会分析问题的方法。要知道，方法对头，就会得出正确的结论，方法不对头，就会发生谬误。怎样才能掌握分析事物的方法呢？唯一途径是学习唯物辩证法。唯物辩证法是我们观察事物的显微镜和望远镜，掌握了这个法宝，就能避免主观性、片面性、表面性。毛泽东同志所以能够看得深，看得远，能够具有高度的科学预见，就是因为他能够熟练地运用这个法宝。我们要时时刻刻学习毛泽东同志运用唯物辩证法的榜样，去掉盲目性，增强自觉性，做到多谋善断。
    第四，要在实践中不断提高。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“抓住了世界的规律性的认识，必须把它再回到改造世界的实践中去，……这就是检验理论和发展理论的过程，是整个认识过程的继续。”这就是说，实事求是的过程，是认识世界和改造世界相结合的过程，是理论和实践相结合的过程。我们经过调查研究、分析思考得出来的看法，到底是否符合实际，只有经过实践的检验，才能作出肯定的结论；特别是有些复杂的问题，只有在实践中取得了直接经验，才能真正摸清它的规律。所以，要达到实事求是，就一刻也不能忽视参加变革现实的实践。只有亲自参加到生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验的实践中去，才能更深刻地、更正确地认识客观世界。所谓实践出理论，就是这个道理。
    实践不但是检验是非的标准，也是丰富和发展真理的源泉。人们对客观规律的认识，由于受着许多条件的限制，只能是逐步发展和提高的。要使我们的认识日益完善起来，最根本的办法是通过实践，因为只有在实践中才能取得经验，提高认识。党的社会主义建设总路线的形成和发展，就是一个典型的例证。早在1955年，毛泽东同志就提出了又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义的口号，在1956年又作了关于“十大关系”的报告，这个报告为多快好省地进行社会主义建设规定了一系列的重大政策。到1958年5月，在党的八大二次会议上，正式制定了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。经过1958年和1959年两年大跃进的实践，不仅充分证明了党的总路线的正确性，同时进一步丰富了总路线的内容。例如党中央和毛泽东同志根据大跃进的经验，在几个并举的基础上，进一步发展成一系列的“两条腿走路”的方针；在工农业的关系方面，提出了以农业为基础，以工业为主导，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合起来的方针等等。
    毛泽东同志曾经把认识的规律作了这样的概括：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。从感性认识而能动地发展到理性认识，又从理性认识而能动地指导革命实践，改造主观世界和客观世界。实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”这就是说，客观事物的发展是无止境的，“求是”也是无止境的。我们要不断地调查研究、分析思考和在实践中总结提高，使我们的主观认识符合于不断变化的客观实际，把工作不断推向前进。
    毛泽东同志在《整顿党的作风》一文中说到：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我们学习毛泽东同志的实事求是的精神，其目的也是如此：不仅要懂得它，更重要的是能够运用它。当然，有关重大的方针、政策问题，都由党中央及时地正确地制定了，但要完满的实现上级所交给的方针任务，还需要我们以实事求是的精神，找出具体事物的具体规律来，因为不如此就可能走弯路。从这一观点出发，在农业方面为了要实现中央发展农业生产的方针，我们曾经对安徽的特点作过系统的调查研究，对作物的栽培作过反复的试验，在1953年就提出了农业生产上的三项改革办法；以后又不断地总结经验，根据客观条件的改变和主观认识的提高，使它不断地丰富和发展，这对保证安徽省农业生产的高速度发展起了相当的作用。又如在治水问题上，为了要实现
  “一定要把淮河修好”的任务，我们调查了淮河流域的情况，总结了治水的经验，提出了“相信群众，依靠群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排，河网化、水稻化”的治水办法。实践证明这个办法也是合乎实际情况的。特别是在两年特大干旱的考验中，它的效果已经显著地表现出来。在工业方面，1958年大办钢铁时，我们按照大中小并举的方针，根据安徽省的条件，大力发展了“小洋群”钢铁基地，这就迅速地奠定了安徽省钢铁生产的基础，达到了高产优质的要求，并且始终保持了高速度的发展。随后我们又把“小洋群”的经验应用到机械、煤炭、化工、轻工等各个方面，都收到了良好的效果。这些效果就是从学习和运用毛泽东同志的实事求是精神得来的。但还必须看到，并不是所有的事情都办得很好了，并不是所有的事情都按照了实事求是的原则去进行工作，特别是有些新的东西还需要我们去摸清它的规律，找出有效的办法。所以，我们要更进一步地在一切工作中坚持贯彻实事求是的原则。不但工农业生产要做到实事求是，财经贸易、文教科学、生活福利、体育卫生以及政法工作，也都要做到实事求是；不但上级机关的领导人员要做到实事求是，基层组织的领导人员和各级机关的所有干部也都要做到实事求是；不但在研究制定方针、政策的时候要做到实事求是，在贯彻执行方针、政策的时候，也要实事求是；不但大问题要实事求是，小问题也要实事求是。总之，所有部门、所有单位、所有干部都要充分发扬实事求是的精神，把工作做得更加细致、更加踏实、更加全面，因为只有这样，才能不犯错误或少犯错误，而使各项工作既迅速又健康地发展。
    为了更好地贯彻和运用实事求是的原则，克服思想障碍，根据以往的经验，要注意批判以下一些片面的看法和错误的态度。
    实事求是是为了更好地鼓足干劲；只有实事求是，才能更好地敢想敢做
    有些人认为：要实事求是，就不能鼓足干劲。这种看法是完全错误的。实事求是是为了鼓足干劲；也只有鼓足干劲，才能做到实事求是。问题很明显，如果不从实际出发，盲目地干，群众的干劲就鼓不起来，要鼓足干劲和经常保持旺盛的干劲，只有实事求是地把客观许可的条件与主观努力结合起来，把劳逸结合起来，才有可能。同样，如果干劲不足，甘居中游，本来能够做到的事情也不争取做到，使自己的思想和行动落后于客观实际，也就违反了实事求是的要求。“求是”本身就包涵着鼓足干劲，如果没有充沛的干劲，就不可能“求”出“是”来。那种认为实事求是就不能鼓足干劲的论调，实质上是在为自己的右倾保守思想或蛮干的思想打掩护。
    有些人认为：实事求是就不能敢想敢做，这同样是错误的。我们的理解与他们相反，我们认为，只有敢想敢做，才能更好地实事求是，也只有实事求是，才能更好地敢想敢做。因为只有敢想敢做才能破除迷信，也只有破除了迷信才能做到实事求是。因为实事求是就是要找出事物的规律，事物的规律认识得越深刻，就能更加大胆地敢想敢做。老话说：“理直气壮”，就是这个道理。所以那种认为实事求是就不能敢想敢做的说法，实际上不过是不敢解放思想或不愿开动脑筋的一种借口。
    右倾机会主义分子借口实事求是来夸大缺点，否定成绩。他们宣扬：要实事求是就得十全十美，不然就“不是实事求是”。这种人实际上是野心家。他们的手段是“攻其一点，不及其余”，他们的目的是想从个别缺点来否定总的成绩，否定党的正确领导，挫伤群众的积极性。对于这种别有用心的言论和行动，我们必须进行坚决的批判和斗争。大家都要懂得：真正从实事中求出完全的“是”来，是需要经过一个过程的，因而工作中出现一些缺点是难免的。但在党的正确路线的指导下，成绩总是主要的，缺点只是次要的，它们之间总是九个指头和一个指头的关系。然而，我们也从不因为缺点是难免的，是一个指头的问题，就忽视它。毛泽东同志一向教导我们要肯定成绩，克服缺点。他在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中曾经指出：“不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。”“一有问题就去解决，不要使问题成了堆才去作一次总解决。”现在确有个别干部，忘记了毛泽东同志的教导，忽视一个指头的问题，这是不许可的，必须切实加以改正。但我们改正缺点是为了更好地发扬成绩，而不是否认成绩，这与机会主义者的观点是完全不相同的。
    我们党所经历的三十九年，是不断革命、不断胜利的三十九年，是毛泽东思想光芒四射、深入人心的三十九年。现在，我们已经进入了社会主义建设持续跃进的新阶段，艰巨的建设任务需要我们去完成，许多新的问题等待着我们去解决。在这样的新形势和新任务下来纪念党的生日，我们要更加认真学习毛泽东思想，努力提高自己的政治理论水平，不断改进自己的思想方法和工作方法，克服片面观点，树立全面观点，把冷与热很好地结合起来，把敢想敢干与实事求是很好地结合起来，把学习与独创很好地结合起来，把在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难很好地结合起来。现在各方面的形势都极其良好，只要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，更好地发扬党的实事求是的优良传统，我们就一定能够在为社会主义和共产主义事业而进行的斗争中，永远从胜利走向更大的胜利！
