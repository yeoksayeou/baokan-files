    More Detailed Revolution, More Refined Revolution
    Tian Youcai, National Advanced Producer, Worker-Engineer of Changchun Locomotive Factory
    Our factory has only been formally in production for a little over a year. The foundation is weak, and the equipment is incomplete, but the enthusiasm of the workers is very high. By the end of May, we had completed half of the year's output value plan, and on June 9th, we completed half of the year's output plan. Take our boiler workshop as an example. When we started production, we didn't have a single machine. Most of the work was manual labor. After more than a year of effort, especially in the first half of this year, we started from scratch, relying on our own efforts to create thirteen indigenous machines and equipment, which has enabled most of the production process to be mechanized and automated.
    I am a worker with more than twenty years of experience. For more than ten years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have carried out more than thirty major innovations aimed at key production areas. This March, the Party promoted me to be an engineer, something I had never even dreamed of in the past. As an engineer, the burden is even heavier. I must do my work more conscientiously and live up to the Party's trust and cultivation. In the first half of the year, I worked with everyone to create a continuous production line for pipe processing and assembly and seven indigenous machines. Take the automatic pipe cutting machine as an example. In the past, cutting large smoke pipes required two people to lift a pipe weighing more than 180 kilograms onto the pipe cutting machine, and it took more than three minutes to cut one pipe. Now, as soon as you turn on the power, the pipe is automatically fed in, and the cutting, unloading, and length setting are all done by the machine. It only takes seven seconds to cut one pipe, and it also saves two people.
    The task for the first half of the year was greatly overfulfilled, and the task for the second half of the year has already been assigned. We cannot have a "breathing space" mentality because the past tasks have been completed well. We must move forward step by step, strive for initiative, and put in even greater effort than in the first half of the year to overfulfill the annual production plan. Now, whenever I have time, I ponder how to exceed the performance of the first half of the year in the second half of the year. After much thought, I still have to start with the technical revolution. Although we have created many indigenous machines and equipment in the past, after sorting them out, we found that there are still many areas that need improvement. For example, the smoke pipe cutting machine created in the first half of the year could be further improved to not only bend pipes but also perform turning and planing. If the pipe threading machine is further developed, it can also cut pipes, mill holes, or remove screw caps, realizing multiple uses for one machine. Some newly created equipment has not been fully utilized yet, some are missing parts, and especially individual production processes still involve manual operation, which affects the overall production improvement. These all need to be resolved in the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement in the second half of the year, so that the level of mechanization and automation can be greatly improved. Even after mechanization is achieved, there is still the goal of automation. The technical revolution has no end. The more detailed the revolution, the more refined the revolution.

    越革越细　越革越精
    全国先进生产者长春机车工厂工人工程师  田有才
    我们厂正式投入生产只有一年多，底子薄，设备不齐全，可是职工干劲很足，5月底就完成了全年产值计划一半，6月9日又完成了全年产量计划的一半。拿我们锅炉车间来说，开始生产，一台机器没有，大部分是体力劳动，经过一年多努力，特别是今年上半年的努力，我们白手起家，自力更生搞了十三台土机器、土设备，使生产过程大部分实现了机械化、自动化。
    我是个做了二十多年工的工人，十几年来，在党的培养教育下，针对生产关键，搞了三十多项重大革新，今年3月党又提拔我做工程师，这在过去我连想都没有想过。做了工程师，担子就更重了。我要更踏实地做好工作，不辜负党的信任和培养。上半年我和大家在一起创制了一条管子加工组装生产连续线和七台土机器。就以自动切管机来说，过去切大烟管需要两个人把一百八十多斤重的管子抬到切管机上，三分多钟才能切一根。现在只要一开电门，管子就自动送上去，切管、下管、定长短全由机器代替，切一根只要七秒钟，还节省两个人。
    上半年任务是大大超额完成了，下半年任务已经布置下来。我们不能因为过去任务完成得不错，产生“松口气”情绪，要步步赶前，争取主动，拿出比上半年还大的劲头，超额完成全年生产计划。现在一有时间我就琢磨，怎样才能使下半年超过上半年，转来转去，还是得从技术革命下手。过去虽然搞了不少土机器，土设备，经过排队，发现还有许多地方需要改进。比方上半年创制的切烟管机，如果再改进改进，不但能煨管，还可以做旋活、刨活；绞管机再发挥发挥，还可以切管、铣眼，或卸螺撑帽，实现一机多用。现在有些新创制的设备，还没有被充分利用，有的缺胳臂少腿，尤其是个别生产工序还有手工操作，影响整个生产提高。这些都需要我们下半年在深入开展技术革命运动中解决，把机械化、自动化水平大大提高一步。就是实现了机械化，还有自动化的目标。技术革命是没有头的，越革越细，越革越精。
