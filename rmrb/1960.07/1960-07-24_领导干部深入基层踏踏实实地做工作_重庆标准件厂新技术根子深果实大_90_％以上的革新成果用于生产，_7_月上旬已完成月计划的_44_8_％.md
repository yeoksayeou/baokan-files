According to Chongqing Daily: Leading cadres of the Chongqing Standard Parts Factory go deep into the front line and work steadily, using the method of "investigation, learning, comparison, and debate" to conduct ideological education for employees and solve specific problems. Innovation achievements have been consolidated and improved, so that more than 90% of new technologies and experiences are used in production. Not only was the semi-annual plan completed ahead of schedule, but the daily output in July increased by 40% compared with the previous month, achieving a good start in early July.

Since the large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution centered on "four modernizations," more than 50% of the innovation projects in this factory have been used in production, playing a significant role. However, some new technologies and experiences have not been applied to production. For example, after installing new technology devices on the shapers, not only could 60% of the machine tools be fully automated, but also the wear of the tools could be reduced. However, due to the lack of corresponding work, some workers were unwilling to use this new technology, and after installing it, they removed it again. The factory held several mobilization meetings for this matter, requiring workers to innovate one and use one, but some projects were still not used.

Why are workers unwilling to use new technologies? This question aroused deep thought among the factory's leading cadres. They felt that general appeals were not enough, and they had to go deep down to understand the crux of the problem. Therefore, when the municipal party committee called for carrying out the "four togethers" movement, the party branch secretary and the factory director settled down in the groups and went deep into the masses to understand the problems of using new technologies and new processes. After a week of investigation and research, they found that the workers were willing to use new technologies. The problem was that they were not used to using new technologies at first, and some of the innovation projects themselves were not perfect enough and needed to be improved. For example, the party branch secretary saw that the worker Gao Zhengxiang was not using a new cutting method device installed on his shaper. After a detailed understanding, it turned out that it was enough to grind the tool only once for planing a flat surface, and using it would require grinding it one more time, so the worker was unwilling to use it.

In order to quickly apply technological innovation achievements to production, the party branch specially held an enlarged meeting of the branch committee and decided to launch a mass movement of "investigation, learning, comparison, and debate" throughout the factory to consolidate, promote, and improve innovation achievements. They mobilized the masses to conduct a major inspection of the factory's main innovation projects. Through the major inspection, the factory successively identified 44 imperfect projects, and also found that some projects were not used by a small number of employees because they were too much trouble. Therefore, they immediately organized the masses to organize debates on the topics of "Will the use of new tools affect the completion of production tasks?" and "What should be done if you are not used to using new tools?" After the debates, the understanding was unified, and everyone consciously and willingly used them.

While adopting "investigation, learning, comparison, and debate," the factory also launched a large-scale technical training activity for new technologies. They used pre-shift and post-shift meetings to focus on one project, and every day the master technicians with high skills gave lectures on technical knowledge and operating points at the group meetings. In this way, learning while doing, and doing while learning, enabled new technologies and new processes to be quickly promoted. For example, the die workshop used multi-clamping on shapers. Originally, some people did not understand the principle of it. After large-scale technical training and operation performances, they generally understood its principle and were happy to engage in multi-clamping, which increased the number of dies planed from one at a time to twenty at a time. In this way, for the same product, the same time, and the same machine, the output increased by nineteen times.

After solving ideological problems and technical training, the masses mastered new technologies. Therefore, the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technological innovation achievements became everyone's more conscious action. For example, the thread rolling machine originally stopped and started intermittently because the "outlet" was abnormal. The workshop employees organized a machine repair medical team to immediately repair the "outlet," and it became normal to use. In this way, the originally imperfect new tools and new processes were further improved.

Because the factory's leading cadres steadily solved the practical problems in promoting new technologies and new processes, the utilization rate of innovation projects increased to 90.2%. Since July, production has been high every day. In the first ten days of the month, 44.8% of the monthly plan was completed, and the output of standard parts was 580,000 pieces, which was 126% of the last ten days of June.

### 领导干部深入基层踏踏实实地做工作  重庆标准件厂新技术根子深果实大  90％以上的革新成果用于生产，7月上旬已完成月计划的44.8％

    领导干部深入基层踏踏实实地做工作
    重庆标准件厂新技术根子深果实大
    90％以上的革新成果用于生产，7月上旬已完成月计划的44.8％
    据重庆日报消息：重庆标准件厂领导干部深入第一线踏踏实实地做工作，用开展“查、学、比、辩”的办法，向职工群众进行思想教育和解决具体问题，革新成果得到巩固提高，使90％以上新技术、新经验使用在生产上，不仅提前全面完成了上半年计划，7月份的日产量又比上月增长40％，实现了7月上旬开门红。
    大搞以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命以来，这个厂已有50％以上的革新项目使用到生产上，发挥了显著的成效。但是，有些新技术、新经验却没有运用到生产上去。如牛头刨床在安装了新技术装置以后，不仅可以使60％机床全部自动化，而且可以减轻刀具的磨损。但是，由于相应的工作没有跟上，有些工人对这项新技术不愿使用，安上以后，又把它撤掉了。厂里为这件事曾开了几次动员大会，要求工人革新一件使用一件，但有的项目还是未使用起来。
    为什么工人们不愿使用新技术呢？ 这个问题引起了厂领导干部的深思。他们感觉到光是一般号召不行了，必须深入下去了解问题的症结到底在那里。于是在市委号召开展“四同”运动时，党支部书记和厂长就到小组去安家落户，深入到群众中去了解使用新技术、新工艺的问题。他们经过一周的调查研究，发现工人们都愿意使用新技术。问题在于最初使用新技术时还不习惯，有些革新项目本身还不够完善，需要加以改进提高。如党支部书记看到工人高正祥使用的刨床上，安着一个新切削法的设备不用，经过详细了解，原来是因为刨一次平面只磨一次刀就够了，要用上它，反而要多磨一次，所以工人不愿用。
    为了使技术革新成果迅速用到生产上去，党支部专门召开了支委扩大会议，决定在全厂范围内开展一个“查、学、比、辩”的群众性运动，来巩固、推广和提高革新成果。他们发动群众对全厂的主要革新项目进行了大检查。通过大检查，全厂先后查出不完善的项目就有四十四项，也发现部分项目是少数职工因嫌麻烦而不愿意使用的。于是他们立即组织群众以“使用新工具会不会影响生产任务的完成？”“使用新工具不习惯应该怎样办？”为题组织了辩论。经过辩论，统一了认识，大家自觉自愿地使用起来。
    在采用“查、学、比、辩”的同时，全厂还开展了新技术大练兵的活动。他们利用班前班后会针对一个项目，每天由技术高的老师傅在小组会上大讲技术知识及操作要点。这样，边学边干，边干边学，使新技术、新工艺很快获得推广。比如模具车间在刨床上使用多夹活，原来一些人不懂它的道理，经过技术大练兵和操作大表演，普遍都了解了它的原理，都乐于搞多夹活，使模具由原来一次刨一个，增加到一次刨二十个。这样，同一的产品，同样的时间，机台不变，产量提高了十九倍。
    在解决思想问题和技术练兵以后，群众掌握了新技术。于是，技术革新成果的巩固、推广和提高就成为大家更加自觉的行动。如原来搓丝机因为“出口”不正常，时打时停，车间职工就组织机修医疗组即时对“出口”进行了整修，使用便正常了。这样，原来不完善的新工具、新工艺进一步得到了改进。
    由于这个厂的领导干部踏踏实实地解决推广新技术、新工艺中的实际问题，使革新项目利用率提高到90.2％，7月以来天天高产，仅上旬就完成了月计划的44.8％，标准件产量完成五十八万件，为6月下旬的126％。
