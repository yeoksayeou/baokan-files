From Our Commune:

    A Family's Competition

    On July 18th, two large-character posters were pasted in front of the office of the Xingzhuang Production Team of the Liuyingwu Commune. The one on the left read: "Sister-in-law Fengying, listen up! Tomorrow I'll compete with you to win! If you don't break the five mu mark in weeding, I'll gladly become your student. Your sister, Jinglan."

    The one on the right read: "You have ambition, and I have the will to match! I'm willing to compete with my sister. If I don't weed six mu of land, I'll gladly give my sister the red flag. Your sister-in-law, Fengying."

    The aunt and niece were going to have a competition, and Father Xing Jiuhe quickly found out. The old man thought to himself: "This year, to achieve the 'hundred, thousand, ten thousand' goal, everyone must strive to be advanced. Don't let them laugh at this old man for falling behind." So he said to his son, Xing Jingtai, "Since the aunt and niece are competing, let's have a competition too, father and son!" Jingtai, looking at his father's excited face, said with difficulty, "You're fifty years old, how could you possibly beat us? I think Dad should just focus on doing the small odd jobs the production team assigns you." The old man said, "Don't underestimate me because I'm old. When it comes to weeding, you're still far behind! If you don't believe me, let's compete for a day and see!"

    The next day, just as the east was beginning to glow, Fengying, eager for the day to dawn, woke up. She got out of bed quietly, but when she went out the door, she was shocked—the courtyard gate was already open. She realized her opponent was ahead of her, so she hurried to catch up. The sound of the door opening woke Jingtai. He rolled over and found that his wife had already gotten up and left, so he jumped out of bed, grabbed his hoe, and chased after her. The last one to get up was the old man. He saw no movement in any of the rooms and thought: "These young people are just tough talkers; once they fall asleep, they're not themselves!" But when he discovered that the courtyard gate was already open, he hurriedly shouldered his hoe and headed for the production team.

    That day, the whole family's work efficiency exceeded their usual performance. Jinglan surpassed the five mu mark; Fengying weeded six mu; Jingtai weeded 1.8 mu of land for his father, adding up to 5.7 mu; and the old man weeded 3.5 mu, with the best quality. However, he was still not satisfied and said, "I got up late today, just wait and see tomorrow!"

    一个家庭的竞赛
    7月18日，刘营伍公社邢庄生产队办公室的门前贴了两张大字报。左边的一张写着：“嫂嫂凤英你是听，明天跟你比输赢，除草不破五亩关，甘拜老师当学生。妹妹景兰”
    右边的一张写着“你有雄心我有志，愿陪妹妹比高低，锄草不到六亩地，愿给妹妹送红旗。嫂嫂凤英”
    姑嫂要比武，很快让父亲邢九和知道了。老头子心里想：“今年要实现‘百千万’就得人人赶先进，别让她们笑话我老头子落后。”就对儿子邢景太说，“她姑嫂比赛，咱爷俩也比一比吧！”景太看着父亲兴奋的脸色为难地说：“你五十岁的人了，怎么着也比不过俺们；我看爹就把生产队让你做的小零活做好就行了。”老头子又说：“别看我岁数大，讲到锄草你们还差的远哩，不信咱比上一天看看。”
    第二天东方刚发亮，急待天明的凤英就醒来了。她轻手轻脚地起了床，可是走出房门一看，大吃一惊——脚门已经开了。她明白自己的对手走在前边了，就紧忙着追了出去。开门的响声把景太惊醒了。他一翻身发现爱人已经起床走了，便跳下床拿起锄就追。最后起床的是老头子。他见各屋一点动静也没有，心想：这些年轻人就是嘴头硬，一睡着就不是他们啦！”可当他发现脚门已经打开时，就急忙扛起锄头奔往生产队。
    这一天，全家的工效都超过了平时。景兰过了五亩关；凤英锄了六亩；景太替父亲锄了一亩八分地，加到一块是五亩七，老头子锄了三亩半，质量最好。但是，他还不满足地说：“今天我起晚了，看明天的！”
