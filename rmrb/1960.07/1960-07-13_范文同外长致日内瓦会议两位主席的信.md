　　Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's Letter to the Two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference

　　(Attached) Full text of the letter from Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference:
　　Your Excellencies,

　　The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is facing a very serious situation: On the one hand, US imperialism is intensifying its interference in South Vietnam, and on the other hand, the South Vietnamese authorities are increasingly carrying out terror in South Vietnam, massacring former resistance members and patriotic, peace-loving people.

　　The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam feels it necessary to bring the above situation to the attention of the two chairmen and request the two chairmen to take measures to ensure that South Vietnam strictly fulfills the Geneva Accords.

　　The Geneva Conference ended the French war of aggression against Vietnam and recognized Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The Geneva Accords strictly prohibit any foreign interference in Vietnam and stipulate that the French expeditionary forces must be permanently withdrawn from South Vietnam, and that foreign troops and military personnel are prohibited from being dispatched to Vietnam.

　　However, disregarding the above fundamental principles, US imperialism has continuously deepened its interference in South Vietnam since the restoration of peace.

　　While transporting weapons and new war materials to South Vietnam, the United States also illegally maintained a "Military Assistance Advisory Group." The "Military Assistance Advisory Group" was originally an American military organization that served the French aggression against Vietnam. The number of military personnel in this organization has now increased from 200 at the time of the armistice to more than 2,000. The US government has also established many new institutions in the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," making the group a military machine for the United States to accelerate war preparations in South Vietnam.

　　Recently, the US government and the South Vietnamese authorities, under the pretext of replacing the French military personnel who had long since withdrawn, openly announced an increase in the number of US military advisors in the "Military Assistance Advisory Group." Obviously, this is a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords and part of the United States' conspiracy to step up war preparations in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　For several years, in order to serve the US war preparation conspiracy in the South, the South Vietnamese authorities have exhausted all kinds of terrorist methods to massacre former resistance members and patriotic, peace-loving people in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese authorities have used regular troops to conduct large-scale mopping-up operations in vast areas of South Vietnam continuously. They promulgated Decree No. 10 in 1959, established special military tribunals, and carried portable guillotines around the South to kill former resistance members and patriotic, peace-loving people.

　　Your Excellencies,

　　Due to the interference of US imperialism in South Vietnam, the Geneva Accords on Vietnam are being seriously undermined. Vietnam is still divided, the democratic and free rights of the people of South Vietnam are being trampled upon, the independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese nation are being violated, and peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is being seriously threatened.

　　The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam feels very regrettable that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam has not taken a firm attitude and measures to stop this situation in time. Following the illegal resolution passed by the International Commission in 1958 by a majority vote, allowing the South Vietnamese authorities to import new weapons to replace the weapons of the French invading forces that must be withdrawn, recently, disregarding the firm opposition of the Polish representative, it passed a resolution by a majority vote, believing that the South Vietnamese authorities and the US government have the right to send additional US military personnel to South Vietnam to strengthen the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," and said that this was a rotation of French military personnel. In addition, the International Commission also passed a resolution by a majority vote, believing that Decree No. 10 of 1956 of the South Vietnamese authorities was irrelevant to Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords and any other clauses.

　　The resolution allowing US military personnel to enter South Vietnam violates the fundamental principle of the Geneva Accords aimed at preventing the recurrence of war. The Vietnam International Commission has clearly exceeded its mission and authority.

　　These resolutions of the Vietnam International Commission have provided conditions for the United States to strengthen its interference in South Vietnam, prepare for a new war, and have encouraged the South Vietnamese authorities to massacre former resistance members and patriotic, peace-loving people in South Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has consistently respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords, solemnly declares that it completely does not recognize the aforementioned resolutions of the International Commission.

　　In order to strictly implement the Geneva Accords, and for the sake of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly requests the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to instruct the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam: 1. Reconsider and rescind the resolution on allowing US military personnel to enter South Vietnam under the pretext of replacing the military personnel of the French expeditionary forces that have been withdrawn, and take measures to stop all interference by US imperialism in South Vietnam, and expel the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," this American military organization, from South Vietnam. 2. Reconsider and rescind the resolution on Decree No. 10 of 1959 of the South Vietnamese authorities, and take measures to force the South Vietnamese authorities to strictly implement Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, and stop retaliation and discrimination against former resistance members in South Vietnam.

　　I take this opportunity to extend my highest respects to the two chairmen.

### 范文同外长致日内瓦会议两位主席的信

　　范文同外长致日内瓦会议两位主席的信
    （附）越南民主共和国外交部长范文同致日内瓦会议两位主席信的全文：两位主席：
    日内瓦协议在越南的执行正面临非常严重的形势：一方面，美帝国主义加强对越南南方的干涉，另一方面，越南南方当局正在变本加厉地在越南南方施行恐怖，残杀前抗战人员和爱国、爱和平人士。
    越南民主共和国政府感到有必要提请两位主席注意上述形势，要求两位主席采取措施，保证越南南方严正履行日内瓦协议。
      日内瓦会议终止了法国侵略越南的战争，并且承认了越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。日内瓦协议绝对禁止任何外国对越南的干涉，并且规定法国远征军必须永远撤出越南南方，同时禁止外国增派军队和军事人员到越南。
    然而，美帝国主义不顾上述的根本原则，从和平恢复迄今，不断地加深对越南南方的干涉。
    与运送武器和新的战争物资到越南南方的同时，美国还非法维持了“军事援助顾问团”。“军事援助顾问团”原来是为法国侵略越南服务的一个美国军事组织。该组织的军事人员数目现在已从停战时的二百人增加到二千多人。美国政府还在“军事援助顾问团”中，新设立了许多机构，使该团成为美国加速越南南方备战的一部军事机器。
    最近，美国政府和越南南方当局借口替换法国早已撤退的军事人员，公开宣布增加“军事援助顾问团”中的美军顾问。很显然，这是明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议的行动，这个行动是美国在印度支那和东南亚加紧备战的阴谋的一部分。
    几年以来，越南南方当局为了服务于美国在南方的备战阴谋，用尽了各种恐怖办法，残杀越南南方的前抗战人员和爱国、爱和平人士。越南南方当局使用正规军队连续在越南南方广大地区进行大规模的扫荡。它们颁布了1959年十号法令，设立特别军事法庭，并携带杀头机巡回于南方各地，杀害前抗战人员和爱国、爱和平人士。
    两位主席：
    由于美帝国主义对越南南方的干涉，关于越南问题的日内瓦协议正受到严重的破坏。越南仍然被分裂，越南南方人民的民主自由权利遭受蹂躏，越南民族的独立和主权受到侵犯，印度支那和东南亚的和平受到严重的威胁。
    越南民主共和国政府感到非常遗憾的是，越南国际监察和监督委员会没有采取坚决的态度和措施及时制止这种情况。国际委员会继1958年以多数票通过允许越南南方当局输入新武器以替换必须撤出的法国侵略军的武器的非法决议之后，最近，又不顾波兰代表的坚决反对，以多数票通过决议，认为越南南方当局和美国政府有权向越南南方增派美国军事人员，以增强“军事援助顾问团”，并且说这是轮换法国的军事人员。此外，国际委员会又以多数票通过决议，认为越南南方当局的1956年十号法令与日内瓦协议第十四条丙款以及任何其他条款无关。
    允许美国军事人员进入越南南方的决议违反了旨在防止战争再起的日内瓦协议的根本原则。越南国际委员会显然超越了它的任务和权限。
    越南国际委员会的这些决议为美国加强对越南南方的干涉、准备新的战争提供了条件，并且鼓励了越南南方当局大肆杀害越南南方的前抗战人员和爱国、爱和平人士。始终不渝地尊重和严正履行日内瓦协议的越南民主共和国政府郑重宣布，完全不承认国际委员会的上述决议。
    为了严正履行日内瓦协议，为了印度支那和东南亚的和平，越南民主共和国政府郑重要求1954年日内瓦会议两位主席指示越南国际监察和监督委员会：1、重新考虑和取消关于允许美国军事人员借口代替已经撤出的法国远征军军事人员而进入越南南方的决议，同时采取措施制止美帝国主义对越南南方的一切干涉，把“军事援助顾问团”这个美国军事组织驱逐出越南南方。2、重新考虑和取消关于越南南方当局1959年十号法令的决议，同时采取措施迫使越南南方当局严正履行关于在越南停止敌对行动协定的第十四条丙款，停止对越南南方的前抗战人员的报复和歧视行为。
    借此机会，我谨向两位主席致以崇高的敬意。
                        越南民主共和国外交部长　范文同
                                      1960年6月24日于河内
