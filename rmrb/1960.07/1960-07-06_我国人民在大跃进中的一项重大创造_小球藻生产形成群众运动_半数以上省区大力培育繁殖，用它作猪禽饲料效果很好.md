This newspaper reports: More than half of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country are currently promoting the cultivation and propagation of chlorella.

In Zhejiang Province, which took the lead in promoting large-scale chlorella production nationwide, the area dedicated to chlorella propagation has reached over 2,130 mu since the beginning of this year. People's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are widely promoting and producing chlorella feed. More than 1,000 pig farms in the city have set up equipment for cultivating and propagating chlorella, and have begun producing large quantities of chlorella for feeding pigs. The Guilin, Baise, and Nanning regions of Guangxi have launched a mass movement to vigorously develop chlorella, promoting chlorella production on a large scale. The Guilin and Baise regions have already produced more than 400,000 jin of chlorella. In Zibo City, Shandong, 42 out of 44 people's communes have built ponds for chlorella production. In the Nanchong region of Sichuan, chlorella production is being promoted everywhere, from towns to villages. More than 3,000 pig farms in Wusheng County have all cultivated and propagated chlorella. People's communes in Suijiang County, Yunnan, are universally producing chlorella. Currently, the county has established more than 1,000 chlorella production ponds, producing more than 41,000 jin of concentrated chlorella solution daily. Shaodong County, Hunan, is universally promoting chlorella throughout the county. More than 1,900 pig farms in the county have built chlorella production equipment, producing 65,000 jin of concentrated chlorella solution daily.

Chlorella is a single-celled aquatic plant that is not only fast-growing, high-yielding, and low-cost, but also very nutritious. It can be used to replace part of the concentrated feed for livestock and poultry. Various places have achieved good results using chlorella to feed livestock. In Muyang People's Commune, Suiyang County, Guizhou, feeding young pigs two to three jin of dried chlorella powder mixed with ordinary feed resulted in a daily weight gain of 14 to more than 15 liang per pig, more than half a jin more than pigs that were not fed chlorella. A comparative experiment at the Shizuishan Commercial Bureau Feedlot in Ningxia showed that pigs weighing around 50 jin gained more than 7 jin and 6 liang in ten days when fed an extra jin of chlorella daily, an average daily weight gain of 7.6 liang; pigs that were not fed chlorella gained 4 jin in ten days, an average daily weight gain of 4 liang. In the Aiguo No. 2 Brigade of the Sanjiao Commune in Zhongshan County, Guangdong, 20 third-category sows had not been coming into heat for a long time. After being fed chlorella for 45 days, they successively came into heat and were mated. Some have already begun to produce piglets. An experiment conducted by the Mayu Commune Livestock Farm in Ruian County, Zhejiang, using ten dairy cows showed that after the cows ate chlorella, the average daily milk yield increased from 53 jin to 64 jin, a net increase of 11 jin. The Beijing Food Company's duck farm also achieved good results using chlorella to fatten ducks.

More than ten provinces (regions) and cities, including Zhejiang, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hebei, Shanxi, and Beijing, attach great importance to the promotion and propagation of chlorella feed. Zhejiang Province has listed chlorella production as an important measure for developing animal husbandry throughout the province and will continue to vigorously promote it. Recently, Qinghai, Shanxi and other provinces have specifically issued notices to promote chlorella production. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee required the agricultural and pastoral production leadership departments in various parts of the province to promptly establish chlorella promotion headquarters and leading groups to launch a mass movement to vigorously develop chlorella. Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces have also successively held on-site meetings to organize the large-scale promotion of chlorella production from point to area. Hebei Province convened meetings of county livestock bureau directors in various regions to deploy the promotion of chlorella production. Hunan Province also organized five technical working groups to go to the countryside to promote and impart chlorella production technology. In order to adapt to the requirements of large-scale promotion of chlorella production, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Qinghai, Beijing and other places have successively held training courses to train a group of production technicians. Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan, Guangxi and other places have successively sent people to Zhejiang to visit and learn advanced experience, and then promote it back home. In mid-June, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice requiring all localities to quickly and universally promote the production of chlorella feed, and regarded chlorella production as an important way to solve the current shortage of concentrate feed and improve the quality of live pigs.

    我国人民在大跃进中的一项重大创造
    小球藻生产形成群众运动
    半数以上省区大力培育繁殖，用它作猪禽饲料效果很好
    本报讯　全国已有半数以上的省、市、自治区正在推广培养繁殖小球藻。
    在全国首先大面积推广发展小球藻生产的浙江省，今年以来全省繁殖小球藻的面积已达二千一百三十多亩。北京市郊区各人民公社广泛推广和生产小球藻饲料，全市已有一千多个养猪场设置了培养繁殖小球藻的设备，开始大量生产小球藻喂猪。广西的桂林、百色、南宁等专区开展起大搞小球藻群众运动，在大面积上推广小球藻生产。桂林、百色两专区已生产了四十多万斤小球藻。山东淄博市四十四个人民公社已有四十二个公社建池生产小球藻。四川南充专区从城镇到农村，到处都在推广小球藻生产。武胜县三千多个养猪场，已做到场场培养繁殖小球藻。云南绥江县各人民公社普遍生产小球藻，目前全县已建立起小球藻生产池一千多个，日产小球藻浓缩液四万一千多斤。湖南邵东县在全县范围内普遍推广小球藻，全县已有一千九百多个养猪场建设了小球藻生产设备，日产小球藻浓缩液六万五千斤。
    小球藻是一种单细胞的水生植物，它不仅具有生长快、产量高和成本低的特点，而且营养非常丰富，用它可以代替部分精饲料喂养家畜和家禽。各地用小球藻喂养家畜效果良好。贵州绥阳县募阳人民公社用二到三斤小球藻干粉，掺入一般饲料喂架子猪，一头猪日长十四两到十五两多，比没有喂小球藻的猪多长半斤多。宁夏石咀山商业局饲养场对比试验，重五十斤左右的猪每天加喂一斤小球藻，十天增重七斤六两多，平均每天增加体重七两六钱；没有加喂小球藻的猪，十天增加体重四斤，平均每天增重四两。广东中山县三角公社爱国二大队有二十头三类母猪长期不发情，经过加喂四十五天小球藻，先后发情配了种，目前有的已开始产猪仔。浙江瑞安县马屿公社畜牧场用十头奶牛做试验，牛吃小球藻后，日产奶量平均由五十三斤提高到六十四斤，净增十一斤。北京市食品公司养鸭场用小球藻填鸭，也收到良好的效果。
    浙江、广西、云南、四川、贵州、河北、山西、北京等十多个省
  （区）市，都十分重视小球藻饲料的推广繁殖工作。浙江省把生产小球藻列为全省发展畜牧业的一项重要措施，要继续大搞。最近青海、山西等省专门发出了推广小球藻生产的通知，青海省委要求省内各地农牧业生产领导部门及时成立推广小球藻生产指挥部和领导小组，掀起一个大搞小球藻的群众运动。云南、贵州等省还先后召开了现场会，组织由点到面的大面积推广小球藻生产的工作。河北省分片召开县的畜牧局长会议，部署推广小球藻生产。湖南省还组织了五个技术工作组下到农村，边宣传，边传授小球藻生产技术。广东、广西、安徽、青海、北京等地为了适应大量推广小球藻生产的要求，都陆续举办了训练班，培养了一批生产技术人员。辽宁、山东、四川、广西等地都先后派人到浙江去参观学习先进经验，回去加以推广。农业部在6月中旬发出了通知，要求各地迅速普遍推广小球藻饲料生产，并把小球藻生产视为解决当前精料不足、提高生猪质量的一个重要办法。（附图片）
