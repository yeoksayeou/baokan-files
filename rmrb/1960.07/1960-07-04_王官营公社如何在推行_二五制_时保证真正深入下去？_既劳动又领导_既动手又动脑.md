    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Hebei Daily, since Fengrun County's Wangguanying Commune implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, the vast majority of cadres have gone to the forefront of production, settling down in the fields, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the peasants. They first become students of the masses and then teachers, solving many key problems and powerfully promoting current production.

    Since Wangguanying Commune implemented the "Two-Five System" in April this year, all seven Party Committee secretaries and more than one hundred cadres in the commune have moved to production teams, production sub-teams, and pig farms to settle down. Their work has become more in-depth and solid. However, the following two situations have emerged among some cadres: some people, after going down, still only made superficial visits and issued orders, and their work could not truly go deep; others, after going down, only took care of labor and did not address problems, using their hands but not their brains. After analysis and research, the Commune Party Committee believed that cadres going to the forefront was only the first step in improving work. The more important issue was to truly delve deeply, discover problems, solve problems, and specifically help the production team cadres lead production better. To solve this problem, the Commune Party Committee, on the one hand, adopted the method of having the secretary take the lead in going down to offer specific advice and help them learn to grasp the key, find problems, and teach work methods; on the other hand, combined studying Chairman Mao's works with organizing discussions to ideologically improve the cadres' understanding. At the same time, attention was paid to grasping models, commending advanced individuals, and establishing pacesetters. For example, they commended the general branch secretaries Xu Guang and Xu Changyou, who were active in labor and worked deeply in implementing the "Two-Five System," using their advanced examples as a mirror to educate and motivate cadres. Through education and assistance, these cadres further improved their understanding. Su Gengyang, the general branch secretary of Wangguanying Management Area, whose work originally could not go deep, also settled down in a production team with the help of Gao Gutian, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee.

    In promoting the "Two-Five System," the Wangguanying Commune Party Committee deeply realized that if they wanted to further deepen their work, cadres at all levels must strive to:

    (1) Put down the airs of cadres and adhere to the "Four Together" style. This is the primary link in improving leadership style and deepening work. If you are willing to be a primary school student of the masses and humbly listen to their opinions, the masses will confide in you and tell you everything, making it possible to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Xu Guang, the general branch secretary of Shiwangzhuang Management Area, in order to solve the technical problem of raising sweet potato beds, took Li Chunqing, an experienced old farmer from Shixia Village, as his teacher, and learned with him while working. As a result, he found experience with universal guiding significance from here, and personally drove a donkey for this old farmer to teach the technique to each team, ensuring that all six hundred and sixty-eight sweet potato beds in the entire management area produced a lot and grew fast.

    (2) Observe, think, and work while laboring. To make work in-depth, meticulous, and down-to-earth, one must learn to observe problems and be diligent in using one's brain. If you only participate in labor without activating the brain, you may not see problems even when they come to you, or even if you see them, you may only grasp the phenomena of things without grasping their essence if you do not analyze them carefully. When the Huoshiying Brigade was fighting drought and planting sweet potatoes, the momentum was great, and the commune members were full of energy. Men, women, old and young, all used basins and bottles, but the progress was very slow. After careful analysis while participating in labor, the general branch secretary Zhu Engui found that the reason was that the tools had not been reformed, and the work efficiency was low. So he proposed measures to reform the tools, replacing bottles and basins with buckets, and the progress accelerated by a factor of two.

    (3) Learn the work method of dissecting a sparrow and using a point to lead the whole area. Dissecting a sparrow is a scientific working method that our Party has always advocated. After cadres are dispersed to the grassroots, they should make good use of this method, combining staying at a point with connecting the point to the whole area, using a point to lead the whole area. When the "Two-Five System" was first implemented, some cadres in the Yankou Management Area believed that participating in labor in one place would make it impossible to guide the overall work, so they were unwilling to stay at a point. When the Commune Party Committee organized everyone to study "On Practice," it raised the method of dissecting a sparrow to the level of epistemology to explain it, thereby correcting the understanding of some people.

    (4) Actively help grassroots cadres arrange work and act as an advisor. The fundamental purpose of cadres participating in production is to improve work, help production team cadres do their work well, and promote the great leap forward in production. After cadres at all levels go deep into the forefront of production, they must take helping grassroots cadres arrange work and acting as an advisor as an important task. The cadres of the production teams in the Yankou Management Area had high enthusiasm and sufficient energy, but their ability to analyze and understand was poor. Sometimes, when there was too much work, they could not arrange it well. After discovering this, Liu Shengyuan, the general branch secretary of the management area, took time to help them study theory and the instructions from higher levels. After studying, the cadres' thinking became clearer, they had more ways to work, and the work changed from passive to active.

    Grasping the above four links is an important aspect of deepening work, but it is also necessary to conscientiously hold meetings to summarize and study work. The cadres of Wangguanying Commune have realized in practice that the process of summarizing and studying work is also the process of improving cadres. During the "two" days of each meeting, people report in detail the situations and problems they have learned, exchange ideas with each other, and, after everyone's analysis and research, summarize experiences and lessons. Then, the cadres bring them back to guide the work. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," this commune has concentrated on summarizing work seven or eight times, and each time it has been able to conscientiously solve one or two major problems. At the same time, attention is also paid to combining the summary of work with theoretical study, guiding cadres to analyze problems in actual work with theoretical viewpoints, and using actual problems to explain theoretical principles, so that learning and work can promote each other.

    王官营公社如何在推行“二五制”时保证真正深入下去？
    既劳动又领导　既动手又动脑
    本报讯　据河北日报报道：丰润县王官营公社推行“二五制”领导方法以来，绝大多数干部走上生产第一线，在田间安营扎寨，与农民同吃同住同劳动同商量，先当群众的学生，后当先生，解决了很多关键问题，有力地推动了当前生产。
    王官营公社从今年4月推行“二五制”以来，全社七名党委书记和一百多名干部，分别搬到生产队、生产小队、猪场安家落户，他们的工作更深入更扎实了。但是在个别干部中也出现了以下两种情况：有的人到了下边，仍然走马观花，发号施令，工作不能真正深入下去；也有的人下去以后，只管劳动不抓问题，动手不动脑。公社党委经过分析研究，认为干部走上第一线，仅仅是改进工作的第一步，更重要的问题，在于真正深入下去，发现问题，解决问题，具体帮助生产队干部把生产领导得更好。为解决这一问题，公社党委一方面采取由书记带头下去的办法，具体出谋划策，帮助他们学会抓关键、找问题，教给工作方法；一方面结合学习毛主席著作，组织讨论，从思想上提高干部的认识水平。同时注意抓样板，表扬先进，树立标兵。如表扬在执行“二五制”中劳动积极，工作深入的总支书记徐广、徐长友等人，以他们的先进事例作镜子，教育激励干部。通过教育帮助，使这些干部进一步提高了认识。王官营管理区总支书记苏浭阳，原来工作深入不下去，在公社党委书记高古田的帮助下，也在一个生产队安家落户了。
    王官营公社党委在推行“二五制”中，深刻体会到要想使工作进一步深入下去，各级干部必须努力作到：
      （一）放下干部架子，坚持发扬“四同”作风。这是改进领导作风，深入工作的首要一环。甘心当群众的小学生，虚心听取群众意见，群众才会向你交心，无话不说，才有可能及时发现问题，解决问题。石王庄管理区总支书记徐广同志，为了解决养薯炕的技术问题，拜石匣村有经验的老农李春青为师，和他一起边干边学，结果他从这里找到了具有普遍指导意义的经验，又亲自为这位老农赶驴到各小队传授技术，保证了全管理区六百六十八铺薯炕，个个出的多，长的快。
      （二）要边劳动，边看、边想。要把工作作得深入细致，踏踏实实，必须学会观察问题和勤于动脑。下去劳动就只参加劳动，不开动大脑这个机器，有时问题碰到自己头上，也可能看不到，有时即便是看到了，不认真分析，很可能只抓住事物的现象，而捉不住本质。火石营大队在抗旱栽薯时声势很大，社员干劲挺足，男女老少、盆子瓶子都上了阵，可是进度很慢。总支书记朱恩贵在参加劳动中经过认真分析，发现是因为工具没改革，工作效率低。于是提出改革工具的措施，瓶子、盆子换上了水桶，进度加速了一倍。
      （三）要学会解剖麻雀、以点带面的工作方法。解剖麻雀是我们党一向提倡的科学的工作方法，干部分散到基层以后，应当很好的运用这个方法，蹲点和点面相结合，以点带面。开始推行“二五制”时，岩口管理区有的干部认为：到一个地方参加劳动，就没法指导全面工作，因此不愿意蹲点。公社党委在组织大家学习“实践论”中，把解剖麻雀的方法提高到认识论上来进行讲解，从而端正了有些人的认识。
    （四）积极帮助基层干部安排工作，当好参谋。干部下去参加生产，根本目的是为了改进工作，帮助生产队干部作好工作，推动生产大跃进。各级干部深入生产第一线以后，必须把帮助基层干部安排工作、当好参谋作为一项重要任务。岩口管理区生产队的干部，热情高，干劲足，只是分析认识能力差，有时工作一多就摆布不开，管理区总支书记刘胜元发觉后，便抽时间帮助他们学习理论和上级的指示，经过学习，干部思想开朗了，工作办法多了，工作由被动转入主动。
    抓住以上四个环节，是深入工作的一个重要方面，但是，还必须认真开好总结研究工作的会议。王官营公社的干部们在实践中体会到，总结研究工作的过程，也是提高干部的过程。在每次“二”的时间集中到社碰头开会的时候，人们都把自己了解到的情况和问题，详细汇报，互相交流，经过大家分析研究，总结出经验和教训，然后干部们再带下去指导工作。这个公社从执行“二五制”以来，前后集中总结工作七、八次，每次都能认真解决一、两个重大问题。同时，在总结工作时，还注意和理论学习相结合，引导干部用理论观点分析实际工作中的问题，用实际的问题阐述理论原理，这样可使学习和工作相互促进。
