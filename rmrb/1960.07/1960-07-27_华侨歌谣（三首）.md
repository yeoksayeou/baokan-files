    Overseas Chinese Ballads (Three Songs)
    Huang Leping
  The enthusiasm in my heart is immense, the patriotic aspirations of overseas Chinese are soaring,
  The motherland's call unleashes a wild surge, not only opening my heart,
  The enthusiasm in my heart is immense!

  The motherland's kindness is profound,
  Only when thirsty do you feel the sweetness of well water to your heart,
  Only when hungry do you feel the fragrance of rice so enticing,
  Only when lonely do you feel your parents are dear,
  Only in times of trouble do you feel the motherland's kindness is profound!

    Most affectionate is the coconut tree,
  The friendship of overseas people is high,
  Reluctantly seeing off returning overseas Chinese,
  Most affectionate is the coconut tree,
  Following us to Hainan Island.
              ——From Indonesia

    华侨歌谣（三首）
    黄乐平
  胸中热情高万丈华侨爱国志激昂，祖国号召掀狂浪，不仅敞开我胸膛，胸中热情高万丈！
  祖国恩情深口渴时才觉得井水甜透心，饥饿时才觉得米饭香诱人，孤苦时才觉得爹娘可亲，患难时才觉得祖国恩情深！
    多情最是椰子树海外人民情谊高，依依不舍送归侨，多情最是椰子树，随咱来到海南岛。
              ——于印度尼西亚
