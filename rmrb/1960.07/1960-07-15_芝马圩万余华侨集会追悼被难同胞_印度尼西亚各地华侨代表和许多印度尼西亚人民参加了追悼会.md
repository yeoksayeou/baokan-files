Xinhua News Agency, July 13th, Jakarta Dispatch: Fifteen thousand Overseas Chinese from all over Indonesia gathered in Tjimahi, West Java, on the morning of the 10th to hold a memorial service in mourning for Overseas Chinese women, Ye Jinniang and Yang Mumei, who were brutally murdered on July 3rd by the West Java military authorities, instigated by forces hostile to the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. Many local Indonesian people also participated in the memorial service.

　　On the 10th, a total of 20,000 people participated in the memorial service and came to express their condolences.

　　The memorial hall was filled with an atmosphere of mourning. Portraits of the two deceased were hung in the hall, and in front of the portraits were wreaths sent by all members of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, as well as wreaths presented by many Overseas Chinese organizations and Indonesian people's organizations. The Tjimahi Garrison Command also sent representatives to present wreaths. Around the hall, elegiac couplets expressing condolences to the deceased and indignation at the tragedy were hung.

　　Inside and outside the hall and on nearby streets, Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people gathered to participate in the memorial service. In addition to representatives from Overseas Chinese organizations in Tjimahi, there were also representatives from more than 150 Overseas Chinese organizations from various parts of Indonesia, including Surabaya, Palembang, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bali, Malang, Belitung, and Jambi. The Central Council of the Indonesian Women's Movement Association and its branches in Jakarta, Bandung, West Java, East Java, and Tjimahi, as well as the Tjimahi branch of the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union, also sent representatives to participate in the memorial service.

　　The memorial service began at 9:30 a.m. More than a dozen children of the two deceased, dressed in mourning, cried bitterly in front of the altar. Many Overseas Chinese and representatives of Indonesian people's organizations who participated in the memorial service could not help but shed tears of sympathy.

　　Lin Dunzhang, the chairman of the funeral committee, pointed out in his eulogy that the Overseas Chinese in Tjimahi, like the Overseas Chinese in other regions of Indonesia, have settled in Indonesia for a long time. The vast majority of them live in harmony and friendly exchanges with the Indonesian people, and have played an active role and made contributions in the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. However, since influential groups in Indonesia launched large-scale anti-Chinese activities, the situation of the vast number of Overseas Chinese has become increasingly difficult, and many Overseas Chinese have lost their livelihoods.

　　Lin Dunzhang said that what particularly angered the Overseas Chinese was that after Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated in his reply to Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi in March this year that the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese had been stopped, and recently in his meeting with Ambassador Huang Zhen, he indicated that he would stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in West Java, the second large-scale armed forced relocation in West Java occurred, even dispatching troops to massacre Overseas Chinese women.

　　In his speech, Lin Dunzhang expressed gratitude to the government and compatriots of the motherland for their solemn stance in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and their concern for this incident, and expressed gratitude to the broad masses of Indonesian people for their deep sympathy for the persecution suffered by Overseas Chinese. He also expressed his firm support for the serious protest and demands made by Ambassador Huang Zhen to the Indonesian government regarding this incident.

　　Finally, Lin Dunxiu, a representative of the deceased's family, delivered a thank-you speech at the meeting. After the memorial service, Overseas Chinese from all over continued to pay their respects in front of the coffins of the deceased and expressed their condolences to the families of the deceased.

　　芝马圩万余华侨集会追悼被难同胞
　　印度尼西亚各地华侨代表和许多印度尼西亚人民参加了追悼会
    新华社13日讯　雅加达消息：来自印度尼西亚各地的华侨一万五千多人，10日上午在西爪哇的芝马圩举行追悼大会，追悼7月3日被敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的势力策动的西爪哇军事当局残杀的华侨妇女叶金娘和杨木妹。当地许多印度尼西亚人民也参加了追悼会。
    10日这一天，参加追悼会和前往致哀的共有两万人。
    追悼会场充满着哀悼的气氛。会场上挂着两位死者的遗像，在遗像前面放置着中国驻雅加达总领事馆全体人员所送的花圈以及许多华侨团体和印度尼西亚人民团体所献的花圈。芝马圩警备司令部也派代表送了花圈。在会场周围，挂满了对死者表示哀悼、对惨案表示愤慨的挽联。
    在会场内外和附近的街道上聚集有参加追悼会的华侨和印度尼西亚人民。参加追悼会的除芝马圩华侨团体的代表外，还有印度尼西亚各地一百五十多个华侨团体的代表，他们来自泗水、巨港、雅加达、日惹、巴厘、玛琅、勿里洞和占碑等地。印度尼西亚妇女运动协会中央理事会和它的雅加达、万隆、西爪哇、东爪哇、芝马圩的分会以及全印度尼西亚中央职工会芝马圩分会也派代表参加了追悼会。
    追悼会在上午九时三十分开始。两位死者的十多名子女披麻戴孝在灵堂前痛哭失声。参加追悼会的许多侨胞和印度尼西亚人民团体的代表也忍不住流下同情之泪。
    治丧委员会主任委员林敦璋在致悼词时指出，芝马圩的华侨和印度尼西亚其他地区的华侨一样，很久以来就定居在印度尼西亚，他们绝大部分人同印度尼西亚人民和睦相处，友好来往，并且在印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中曾经起过积极作用，作出过贡献。但是，自从印度尼西亚有势力集团发动大规模的排华活动后，广大华侨的处境日益困苦，许多华侨丧失了生计。
    林敦璋说，尤其令华侨感到气愤的是，在印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今年3月给中国外交部长陈毅的复信中表示已经停止迫迁华侨活动以后，以及最近同黄镇大使会谈中，表示要停止西爪哇的迫迁华侨活动以后，竟又发生西爪哇第二次大规模的武力迫迁活动，甚至出动军队，屠杀华侨妇女。
    林敦璋在讲话时，表示感谢祖国政府和同胞为维护华侨的正当权利和利益的严正立场和对这一事件所表示的关怀，并表示感谢印度尼西亚的广大人民对华侨遭受迫害所表示的深切同情。他还表示坚决支持黄镇大使就这一事件向印度尼西亚政府提出的严重抗议和要求。
    最后由死者家属代表林敦秀在会上致谢词。追悼会结束后，来自各地的华侨仍不断到死者的灵柩前致哀，并且向死者家属表示慰问。
