　　We Prepare Together
　　Ke Zhongping

　　People mountains, people seas, people rivers, we prepare together!
　　Revolutionary flower, red like fire, Leningrad is the foremost of revolutionary red flowers;
　　Revolutionary flowers bloom towards Lenin, revolutionary people hear Lenin speaking;
　　Revolutionary calls are like a storm, resounding from the ends of the earth to every corner of the sea.
　　Arise! The people at the ends of the earth and every corner of the sea arise!
　　Arise to defend the revolutionary flower, Leningrad is the foremost of revolutionary red flowers!
　　Eisenhower and that small clique, playing with fire atop the red flower;
　　The imperialist nature cannot be changed, to change that small clique, only pull the noose.
　　Pull the noose, people mountains, people seas, people rivers, we prepare together!

　　我们一起准备着
　　柯仲平人山人海人江河，我们一齐准备着！革命花，红赛火，列宁城是革命红花头一朵；革命花向列宁开，革命人听到列宁在演说；革命呼声赛风暴，从天涯响遍海角。起来了！天涯海角的人民起来了！起来保卫革命花，列宁城是革命红花头一朵！艾森豪威尔那小撮，红花头上来玩火；帝国主义本性不能改，改它那小撮，只有拉绞索。拉绞索，人山人海人江河，我们一起准备着！
