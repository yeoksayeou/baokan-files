Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 30th - Fushun Coal Mine completed half of the year's national crude coal production plan ahead of schedule. As of June 29th, the mine had increased production by more than 750,000 tons of crude coal for the state based on completing half of the year's plan. The mine's tunneling workload also completed half of the year's national plan ten days ahead of schedule, achieving a double leap forward in coal mining and tunneling. The mine's production of coking coal, gunpowder, detonators, carbon black, and other products also completed half of the year's national plan ahead of schedule.

In the first half of this year, the vast number of workers in the Fushun mining area vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, self-reliantly creating more than 5,500 small machines using indigenous methods, freeing more than 32,000 people from heavy manual labor such as moving, transporting, loading, unloading, carrying, lifting, smashing, and digging. At the same time, focusing on achieving mechanized coal winning, they vigorously engaged in small-scale machinery supporting, which increased the efficiency of various operations on the coal mining face by an average of two to five times. The vast number of miners also created new coal mining methods for extra-thick coal seam mines and open-pit coal mines. The entire mining area also carried out comprehensive and systematic reforms of machinery and equipment, production management, and labor organization, focusing on promoting these new coal mining methods. Therefore, in the first half of the year, the entire mining area achieved large-scale high production in a fast, good, and economical manner.

Since the beginning of this year, the Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Secretary of the Mining Area Party Committee, and the Director of the Mining Bureau, in the spirit of grasping early, grasping hard, grasping carefully, and grasping accurately, often led working groups to be stationed in various mines, personally participating in and leading production. Cadres of various mines also often went to work underground, settling down on the production front line, and strengthened their leadership over production.

Our newspaper, Fuxin, 30th - Fuxin Coal Mine completed half of the year's national plan twenty days ahead of schedule. As of June 20th, overproduction of more than 650,000 tons of coal completed half of the year's plan, mine tunneling exceeded half of the year's plan by 6.87%, overall efficiency exceeded the plan by 19.6%, coal cost was reduced by 6.56% compared to the plan, and in terms of coal quality, the gangue content was reduced by 20.9% compared to the plan.

The vast number of workers in the Fuxin Coal Mine launched a mass movement to improve coal quality, making every effort to reduce the gangue content and ash content in coal and improve coal quality. The vast number of workers put forward the slogan "Coal that does not meet quality standards will not leave the mine" and strictly implemented the system to ensure coal quality. They adopted the "three selections" quality measures underground. Whether on mine cars, on the work face, or on the chute, workers consciously selected gangue and debris from the coal to ensure that every piece of coal transported out of the mine was good coal. Various mines have also strengthened coal selection work on the ground. The workers of the beneficiation plant launched a technical innovation movement, which not only improved the capacity of coal washing equipment, but also greatly improved the quality of the selected coal.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 28th - The Karamay Oil Area completed the state-stipulated crude oil production plan for the first half of the year ten days ahead of schedule, and crude oil production increased by 1.4 times compared to the first half of last year.

The masses of workers and staff of the entire mining area vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, greatly improving the production capacity of the oil fields and crude oil production. This year, the entire mining area has achieved more than 10,000 technical innovation projects. Many new technologies and new experiences that are of great significance to improving production, such as automated inspection of oil nozzles and new devices for wax removal, have been widely adopted in oil wells throughout the mining area. After these new technologies and new experiences were widely promoted, many low-yield wells became high-yield wells, intermittent production wells became continuous production wells, and the wax formation cycle of oil wells was also extended. Therefore, the output of oil wells has generally increased. Taking the first half of June as an example, the average daily output of each oil well increased by 2.3% compared with May.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 28th - Forestry workers of all ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area of ​​Inner Mongolia, vigorously implemented the policy of combining felling and regeneration, and vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution. As of June 23, they had overfulfilled the timber production plan for the first half of the year seven days ahead of schedule, and overfulfilled the forest regeneration operation plan for the first half of the year by 6% sixteen days ahead of schedule.

At the beginning of the year, the Party Committee of the Greater Khingan Range Forestry Administration rationally arranged felling and regeneration work according to the laws of forestry production. The first quarter is the golden season for timber production, so it was determined to focus on timber production. The second quarter is the plant growth period, grasping both regeneration and felling.

As a result of the vigorous technical innovation, the production of logs in the first half of this year increased by nearly 10% compared with the first half of last year without increasing mechanical equipment. In the past six months, the entire forest area has produced more than 20,000 technical innovations. Loggers have used new tools and new methods such as wooden rail flat cars, wooden monorail hand-push cars, automatic sleds, and ice ditch floating to replace most of the cattle and horse sets for log gathering, which greatly improved work efficiency. It not only enabled log gathering to keep up with the needs of mechanized log transportation, but also reduced costs.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 30th - The leadership work of the Changchun Locomotive Factory is grasped firmly, carefully, comprehensively, and practically, and has comprehensively overfulfilled half of this year's national plan. As of June 20, the actual completion of various plans for half of the factory's annual plan was: product output completed 106.7%; main products: locomotives completed 113%, wheelsets completed 120%, road-use accessories completed 119%; the quality fully met the standards stipulated by the state, and eliminated the return of vehicles for repair; labor productivity completed 139.6%, an increase of 158% compared with the same period last year; costs were reduced by 25.87% compared with the original plan.

In implementing the national plan, this factory paid great attention to comprehensively completing the plan. The factory party committee grasped both product variety and output, as well as quality, cost, and labor productivity, so that various plans were closely linked and promoted each other, ensuring that the plan was comprehensively completed. In order to ensure product quality, in addition to equipping a strong quality inspection cadre, strengthening self-inspection, intermediate inspection, and parts acceptance three-level inspection, and establishing a complete inspection system such as quality analysis meetings, the factory party committee also extensively carried out technical learning, actively improved the technical level of young workers, and carried out ideological education on ensuring quality among workers. The factory's leading cadres also often go deep into the production front line, participate in production and lead production, and organize assaults in a timely manner when they discover weak links. These methods have played a great role in ensuring the comprehensive completion of the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th - In implementing the production plan for the first half of the year, the Chongqing Tire Factory focused on various indicators of product, output, and quality, and achieved comprehensive and sustained high production. As of the 27th, the output of the factory's main product, tires, has completed 54.16% of the annual plan; the quality of tires has been rising quarter by quarter, and the qualification rate in the second quarter reached 98.23%, becoming the month with the highest average quarterly quality since the factory was built; labor productivity, cost, and profit indicators have also overfulfilled the plan for the first half of the year.

The Chongqing Tire Factory is a newly built factory that was launched in 1958 using indigenous methods, with poor equipment and weak technical force. At the beginning of this year, the factory's product quality once declined due to insufficient supply of some raw materials. In order to reverse this situation, the factory party committee organized engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers to form a "quality one-dragon" team to formulate a set of technical management system. On the other hand, the party committee secretary, factory director, and other leading cadres took the lead in leading engineering and technical personnel to go to workshops and teams to plant experimental fields, conscientiously implement process regulations, and solve the key in the implementation. On this basis, the factory established a one-dragon quality inspection system from raw materials entering the factory, rubber mixing, calendering, cutting, bonding, and vulcanization. Each production workshop, each work section, and team also formulated unified operating procedures for each type of work. The implementation of these measures ensured that the factory's output and quality leaped forward together.

    长春机车厂重庆轮胎厂大抓产品质量全面完成各项计划指标
    新华社抚顺30日电　抚顺煤矿提前完成了全年国家原煤产量计划的一半，到6月29日止，全矿在完成全年计划一半的基础上已为国家增产了七十五万多吨原煤。全矿区掘进工作量也提前十天完成全年国家计划的一半，实现了采煤、掘进双跃进。全矿区的炼焦精煤、火药、雷管、炭黑等产品产量，也都先后提前超额完成全年国家计划的一半。
    今年上半年，抚顺矿区的广大职工，大闹技术革新和技术革命，自力更生以土办法创造出了五千五百多台小型机具，使三万二千多人摆脱了搬、运、装、卸、扛、抬、砸、挖等笨重体力劳动。同时，并以实现机械化攉煤为中心，大搞小型机械配套，使采煤工作面的各项作业效率平均提高了二倍到五倍。广大矿工还创造了特厚煤层矿井和露天煤矿全新的采煤方法。全矿区并以推广这些新的采煤方法为中心，对于机械设备、生产管理、劳动组织，也进行了全面系统的改革。因此，上半年全矿区夺得了多快好省的大面积高产。
    今年以来，中共抚顺市委书记和矿区党委书记、矿务局局长，本着抓早、抓狠、抓细、抓准的精神，经常带领工作组分驻各矿，亲自参加生产领导生产。各矿的干部也都经常到井下办公，到生产第一线安家落户，加强了对生产的领导。
    本报阜新30日电　阜新煤矿提前二十天完成了全年国家计划的一半。到6月20日止，超产六十五万多吨煤炭完成了全年计划的一半，矿井掘进超过全年计划一半6.87％，全员效率超过计划19.6％，煤炭成本比计划降低6.56％，煤炭质量方面含矸率比计划降低了20.9％。
    阜新煤矿广大职工展开了提高煤炭质量的群众运动，千方百计地降低煤炭中的含矸率和灰分，提高煤炭质量。广大职工提出“煤炭质量不合格不出矿”的口号，严格执行保证煤炭质量的制度。他们采取了井下“三拣”的质量措施，不论在矿车上、在工作面上、在溜子道上，工人们都自觉地拣选煤炭中的矸石、杂物，保证运出井口的块块煤炭都是好煤。各矿也加强了地面上的煤炭拣选工作。选矿厂的职工展开了技术革新运动，不仅提高了选煤设备的能力，选出的煤炭质量也大大提高。
    据新华社克拉玛依28日电　克拉玛依油区提前十天完成上半年国家规定的原油产量计划，原油产量比去年上半年增长了一点四倍。
    全矿区职工群众大闹技术革新和技术革命运动，大大地提高了油田的生产能力和原油产量。今年全矿区已经实现的技术革新项目有一万多件。自动化检查油嘴和清腊的新装置等许多对提高生产有重大意义的新技术和新经验，已经在全矿区油井普遍采用。这些新技术和新经验普遍推广以后，不少低产井变成高产井，间歇生产井变成连续生产井，油井结腊周期也延长了。因此，油井产量普遍增加。以6月前半月为例，平均每口油井比5月份日产量提高了2.3％。
    据新华社牙克石28日电　内蒙古大兴安岭林区各族林业职工，大力贯彻执行采伐与更新并举的方针，大闹技术革新和技术革命，到6月23日止，已提前七天超额完成了上半年木材生产计划，并提前十六天超额6％完成了上半年森林更新作业计划。
    年初，大兴安岭林业管理局党委就根据林业生产的规律，合理安排了采伐与更新工作。第一季度是木材生产黄金季节，因此确定以木材生产为重点。第二季度是植物生长期，一手抓更新，一手抓采伐。
    由于大闹技术革新的结果，今年上半年原木生产在未增加机械设备的情况下，比去年上半年增长将近10％。半年来，全林区共搞出两万多件技术革新。集材工人用木轨平车、木单轨手扶车、自动爬犁、冰沟流放等新工具、新方法，代替了大部分牛马套子集材。大大提高了工效。不仅使集材跟上了机械化运材的需要，而且降低了成本。
    据新华社长春30日电　长春机车厂领导工作抓得狠、抓得细、抓得全面、抓得踏实，全面超额完成了今年国家计划一半。到6月20日，这个厂全年计划一半的各项计划实际完成情况是：产品产量完成106.7％；主要产品：机车完成113％，轮对完成120％，路用配件完成119％；质量完全合乎国家规定的标准，消灭了返厂修车；劳动生产率完成139.6％，比去年同期提高158％；成本比原计划降低25.87％。
    这个厂在执行国家计划中，十分注意全面完成计划。厂党委既抓产品品种、产量，又抓质量、成本和劳动生产率，使各项计划环环扣紧，互相推动，保证做到全面完成计划。为了保证产品质量，厂党委除配备了较强的质量检查干部，加强了自我检查、中间检查、部件验收三级检查和建立了质量分析会议等整套检查制度外，还广泛开展了技术学习，积极提高青年工人的技术水平和在职工中进行保证质量的思想教育。全厂领导干部还经常深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产，发现薄弱环节及时组织突击，这些办法对于保证全面完成计划起了很大作用。
    新华社重庆30日电　重庆轮胎厂在执行上半年的生产计划中，狠抓产品、产量和质量各项指标，获得了全面持续高产。到27日止，全厂主要产品轮胎产量已经完成全年计划的54.16％；轮胎的质量季季上升，二季度合格率达到98.23％，成为建厂以来季度平均质量最高的一个月；劳动生产率、成本和利润指标也都超额完成了上半年计划。
    重庆轮胎厂是1958年土法上马的新建厂，设备较差，技术力量较薄弱。今年年初，这个厂因为部分原料材料供应不足，产品质量曾一度下降。为了扭转这一情况，厂党委一面组织工程技术人员、老工人成立“质量一条龙”小组，制订了一套技术管理制度，另一方面，党委书记、厂长等领导干部又分工带领工程技术人员下车间、小组去种试验田，带头认真贯彻工艺规程，和解决贯彻中的关键。在这个基础上，全厂从原料进厂、炼胶、压延、切断、贴合和硫化等建立了一条龙的质量检查制度。各生产车间、各工段、小组也都制订了各工种的统一的操作规程。这些措施的实施，保证了全厂产量、质量一齐跃进。（附图片）
