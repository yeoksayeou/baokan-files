　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th. According to a report today from the Indonesian News Agency, Jakarta's wartime authority, Colonel Umar, has ordered the Indonesian "People's Daily" to cease publication indefinitely, starting from July 16th.

　　Lieutenant Edi, a spokesperson for the Jakarta Military Region Command, said today that the "People's Daily" was banned because it published a statement issued by the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on July 8th, entitled: "An Assessment Made One Year After the Establishment of the Working Cabinet Shows That Its Composition Does Not Guarantee the Implementation of the Government's Three-Point Plan, Therefore, a Rapid Reorganization is Necessary."

　　On July 13th, Jakarta's wartime authority also summoned the editor-in-chief of "Eastern Star Daily" regarding the newspaper's news coverage of the Tjimahi incident. Lieutenant Edi, a spokesperson for the Jakarta Military Region Command, said that "Eastern Star Daily's" report on the press release issued by Lieutenant Colonel Arif, the director of the West Java Army Information Office, regarding the Tjimahi incident, "could create a false interpretation by the public," "as if the occurrence of the Tjimahi incident should be blamed on state institutions."

　　The spokesperson said that the military authorities "strongly condemned" the editor-in-chief of "Eastern Star Daily" and ordered him to correct the newspaper's "incorrect reporting."

　　原因是刊载了印度尼西亚共产党的声明
    新华社雅加达15日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社今天报道，雅加达战时掌权者乌马尔上校已经勒令印度尼西亚“人民日报”从7月16日起无定期停刊。
    雅加达军区司令部发言人埃迪中尉今天说，“人民日报”所以被禁止是因为它刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会7月8日发表的一项声明，这项声明的题目是：“在工作内阁成立一年后所作的估价表明，它的组成成分并没有保证政府三点计划的执行，因此有必要迅速进行改组。”
    雅加达战时掌权者7月13日还为“东星报”就芝马圩事件发表的新闻召见了这家报纸的总编辑。雅加达军区司令部发言人埃迪中尉说，“东星报”对西爪哇陆军新闻处处长阿里夫中校就芝马圩事件发表的新闻公报作的报道“能够造成公众的错误的解释”，“如像芝马圩事件的发生应归咎于国家机构似的。”
    发言人说，军事当局“严厉地谴责”“东星报”的总编辑，并且命令他纠正这家报纸的“错误报道”。
