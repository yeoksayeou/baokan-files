Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th. Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, visited workshops and canteens of two transportation units in Lhasa on the 6th to inspect the progress of the technical innovation and technical revolution campaigns.

Panchen Erdeni first arrived at the No. 1 Automobile Team of the Tibet Transportation Bureau. He visited every innovative piece of machinery in the team with great interest. He watched the performances of the vegetable cutting machine, rice washing machine, and dough kneading machine in the canteen with satisfaction. As he watched, he said, "These tools should be widely used in Tibet in the future. They are not only hygienic and labor-saving, but also save a lot of manpower for investment in industrial and agricultural production." The steamed buns produced by the canteen using gasification methods were steaming hot as they came out of the steamer. He went over and patted them with his hand, saying, "How fast! It only took eleven minutes to steam them!"

Next, Panchen Erdeni came to the workshop of the Lhasa Automobile Repair and Assembly Plant to inspect every innovative product of the workers. He also visited the plant's coal-gasified canteen. He asked with concern, "How much fuel can be saved this way?" The person in charge reported that the entire plant used to burn 2,700 jin of firewood every day, but after implementing coal gasification, only 500 jin is needed. Now, the workers throughout the plant are working hard to use coal gas in production. If this reform is completed, it will save the country even more fuel and manpower. Panchen Erdeni said, "The potential of fuel should be fully utilized."

After the inspection, Panchen Erdeni said to the heads of each unit: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, you have made great achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution. On this basis, the innovation movement should be carried out more widely and deeply, giving full play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the workers, and achieving greater results. (Attached picture)

    西藏交通单位推行机械化煤气化
    班禅视察技术革新成果
    新华社拉萨8日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼6日到拉萨两个交通运输单位的车间和食堂，视察技术革新和技术革命开展情况。
    班禅额尔德尼首先来到西藏运输局汽车一队，他兴致勃勃地参观了这个队的每一件革新的机具。他满意地看了食堂的切菜机、淘米器和揉面机的表演，一面看，一面说：“以后西藏应广泛地使用这些工具，不但卫生省力，同时还可以节省很多人力投入工农业生产。”食堂采用蒸气化办法蒸出的馒头，热气腾腾地出笼了，他走过去用手拍了拍说：“多快，只用了十一分钟就蒸熟了！”
    接着，班禅额尔德尼来到拉萨汽车修配厂的车间，视察职工们革新的每一件产品。他还参观了这个厂的煤气化的食堂。他关切地问：“这样可节约多少燃料？”负责人汇报说，过去全厂每天要烧二千七百斤柴，实现煤气化后只要五百斤就够了。现在全厂工人正在大鼓干劲，把煤气用到生产上去，这一改革如果完成，将为国家节省更多燃料和人力。班禅额尔德尼说：“应该充分利用燃料的潜力。”
    班禅额尔德尼在视察结束后，向各单位负责人说：在共产党的领导下，你们的技术革新和技术革命取得很大成绩。在这个基础上，应把革新运动更广泛更深入地开展下去，充分发挥职工们的干劲和智慧，取得更大的成绩。（附图片）
