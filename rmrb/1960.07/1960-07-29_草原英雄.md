    Hero of the Grasslands
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Yizhi

    In June, on a clear day, we visited the famous old cooperative in Mongolia – the “Lenin’s Road” Cooperative with great excitement.
    In the evening, the car reached a wide pasture. The fiery red sunset approached the horizon, and a few veil-like peach-colored clouds drifted in the water-like soft sky. On the golden grassland, a Mongolian girl, riding a steed, nimbly ran back and forth around a large flock of sheep. The sun shone on her dark, round face, on her purple-red robe, looking like a red cloud flashing in front of the snow-white flock of sheep from a distance.
    As I was admiring this picturesque grassland scenery, the Mongolian comrade accompanying me suddenly exclaimed excitedly: "We are almost at the cooperative center!"
    Sure enough, after another ten minutes in the car, a large area of yurts appeared before us, interspersed with many wooden houses and tile-roofed buildings. There were the offices of the cooperative and the soum (county), a creamery, a restaurant, a school, and a sports field. The square was piled with wood, bricks and tiles, and several newly built houses were taller than the original ones. Not far from the square, there was a wooden fence, and herdsmen were shearing sheep in the flock. The livestock machinery station next to the cooperative was parked with rows of tall combine harvesters and light animal-powered mowing machines; the tractors that had just returned from the fields crawled on the grassland like a herd of iron oxen, making a rumbling sound... After a whole day of walking on the vast grassland, suddenly seeing this hot, vibrant, busy and joyful scene, everyone felt unspeakable happiness.
    The cooperative director, Oiyodob, told us that the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative was the first cooperative in Bulgan Province and had a tortuous history of struggle. He pointed to a comrade next to him and said, "This is Comrade Oyilig, he is the founder and first president of this cooperative."
    Oyilig had the strong physique of a Mongolian. Long face, high cheekbones, high nose, tall and large, thick waist, thick arms, and a very strong body, very much like a wrestler at the Naadam Festival. Before the revolution, he was a slave of the feudal lords, later joined the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to turn over a new leaf, served in the army for several years, and after demobilization, the Party sent him to work in the Bulgan Soum of Bulgan Province.
    He began to tell us the history of the cooperative's struggle.
    In April 1939, some Party members and Youth League members of Abuchak Soum in Bulgan Province, with the active support of Oyilig, chairman of Bulgan Soum, amidst varied opinions, invited twenty-five male and female herdsmen to establish the first livestock production cooperative in Bulgan Province - the "Eagle" Cooperative. The members elected Oyilig as the president, and the higher authorities also agreed to transfer him to specialize in cooperatives.
    At that time, people here had all sorts of opinions about cooperatives.
    Some said: "This is a good thing, 'many hands make light work', the cooperative will definitely have a future."
    Some said: "Let's see how they do it for a while."
    Some wealthy herders were saying strange things behind their backs. They said, "Wait and see, these people will make a mess for a while, merge the livestock, and as a result, bring losses to themselves and the country, it would be strange if they don't fight and break up." Some reactionaries even desperately spread rumors and slander, attempting to attack the cooperative cadres and ruin the cooperative.
    Some grassroots cadres in the locality also lacked understanding of cooperatives, they allocated good pastures to individual herdsmen and asked cooperative members to graze livestock in bad pastures three or four hundred kilometers away.
    Despite this, the poor herdsmen liked the cooperative. The following year, the "Eagle" Cooperative already had more than one hundred members. Several cooperatives appeared in Bulgan Province one after another. A special commissioner came from Ulan Bator, he inspected the work of various cooperatives and agreed that the "Eagle" Cooperative should continue to operate. However, a few days later, Oyilig was summoned to the soum. He walked into the soum chairman's office and saw the soum chairman, the special commissioner and another person sitting there.
    "What kind of counter-revolutionary activities are you engaged in?" the person asked angrily.
    "I am running a cooperative, not a counter-revolutionary activity," Oyilig said with a clear conscience.
    "How much public property have you stolen?" the person continued to ask.
    "The cooperative's fund is only a few hundred tugriks (Mongolian currency), I have not stolen anything," Oyilig replied.
    The person continued to scold fiercely, and then turned to the special commissioner and said, "Look, how rampant is your conspiracy?"
    The special commissioner was also very angry, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket, threw it on the table, and retorted loudly: "Don't talk nonsense. My work is completely legal, this is the instruction of the Party Central Committee."
    That person was even more furious, he gave the order: "Lock Oyilig up." In this way, Oyilig was inexplicably imprisoned for forty-five days. Later, everyone learned that the scoundrel was a counter-revolutionary element hidden in the revolutionary ranks.
    During the interrogation, Oyilig protested. The court also believed that he was not guilty. After his release from prison, Oyilig continued to run his cooperative.
    At that time, the various systems of the cooperative were not yet sound, and the cooperative was very chaotic. Oyilig felt that he was uneducated, had few ideas, and faced with a pile of difficulties, he could not help but panic at times. However, he did not waver. He thought: in the past, when the feudal lords had not yet been overthrown, wasn't the difficulty much greater than it is now? I am a Party member, I cannot be intimidated by this little difficulty.
    Oyilig said: "During those difficult years, one thing made me unforgettable for life." That happened the year after he was released from prison, the Provincial Party Secretary of Bulgan Province came to the cooperative. He walked around everywhere, looked carefully everywhere, and also asked Oyilig what he planned to do in the future. Oyilig said that the cooperative wanted to establish a Party branch, build a creamery, buy a tractor, and hire a cultural teacher. After the Provincial Party Secretary left, Oyilig's heart was always uneasy. He felt that the cooperative had many shortcomings, the cooperative's welfare facilities were very poor, and he had thought of many things that should be done for the members, but he did not have the strength to do them...
    Not long after, the province sent three comrades, they gave Oyilig a letter. He thought in his heart that he might be criticized this time. He opened the letter and found that it was a resolution from the Provincial Party Committee praising the "Eagle" Cooperative. The resolution first congratulated the birth of the first livestock production cooperative in Bulgan Province, and pointed out that this was the beginning of the province's herdsmen embarking on the socialist road. The Provincial Party Committee criticized the local grassroots organizations for not supporting the cooperative in the past; approved several of Oyilig's requests, allocated a tractor to the cooperative, and sent three cadres down to help with the work. Oyilig read it, and tears of gratitude flowed from his eyes. He said, I was so happy that my heart was about to jump out when I finished reading the resolution of the Provincial Party Committee.
    Although there were many difficulties in the work, most of the poor herdsmen actively supported the cooperative. They were not afraid of difficulties, did not shy away from hard work, and strived to complete various production tasks in the cooperative. Under the leadership of the Party, Oyilig closely united them, overcame various difficulties, and did a good job in production, making the cooperative more consolidated day by day, and constantly expanding the socialist front. The predecessor of the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative was the "Eagle" Cooperative, and several cooperatives in this area, such as "Peace," "Labor," and "Dawn," were also developed from a production team of the "Eagle" Cooperative at that time.
    From Oyilig's conversation, we learned that there was an old herdsman in the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative named Ochir. He was the first labor hero in agriculture and animal husbandry in the Mongolian People's Republic and one of the founders of the "Eagle" Cooperative. In the most difficult years, Ochir was the most active old member among those poor herdsmen who actively supported the cooperative.
    Ochir is fifty-five years old this year, and he worked as a farmhand for the herdlord at the age of thirteen. Since childhood, he has been herding sheep, riding horses, and hunting on this grassland. His life, his character, were cultivated in this environment. This herdsman's heart is as pure as the snow in winter, his body is as strong as a stone, and his feelings are burning like fire. When he was still a farmhand for the herdlord, when the couple lived in a dilapidated small yurt, he would rather take off the only intact felt on the top of his tent to exchange for a goat, kill it to feed poor friends who came to stay overnight, rather than let friends go hungry overnight. After the victory of the revolution, Ochir became the master of the pasture, herding sheep for his cooperative, braving violent wind and snow, and spending cold winters with the flock of sheep night after night. Ochir is such a person, who can dedicate his entire heart to the people he loves, to the cause he is loyal to at any time.
    When the cooperative was first established, there was very little labor, and Ochir alone managed more than two thousand sheep, allowing other members to free up their strength to do other work. When the Party and the government called on herdsmen to work hard to increase livestock products, he thought all day about how to make livestock grow more meat and produce more wool. When sheep grazed on the pasture, Ochir, regardless of the severe cold and heat, fearlessly observed the flock carefully, accumulating rich sheep herding experience. In the eyes of others, it seems that the grassland is full of the same green grass. However, Ochir can see which grass makes the sheep fat and which grass does not. In order to make the sheep eat well, Ochir carefully selected the grassland and mobilized the pasture in a planned way. He moved his tent again and again, never complaining about being tired.
    Ochir is as familiar with his flock of sheep as he is with his own children. He talks to them, scolds them, loves them, and takes care of them wholeheartedly. Ochir's sheep herding has different methods in all seasons. In summer, early in the morning, he releases the sheep to graze; at noon, when the weather is hot, he lets the sheep rest in a shady place; in the evening, he drives the sheep home until nothing can be seen. After the rain, the grass is wet, and the sheep are not allowed to drink more water to prevent stomach problems. When the weather is sultry, he drives the flock against the wind to make them sweat, which can grow more meat. In winter, the sheep have already grown fat, and they are not allowed to run fast when grazing, they must walk slowly to keep the sheep fat. The sheep that Ochir grazes are fat all year round. The mother animals are fat and strong, and the lambs born are strong, resistant to disease, and have more wool and more milk. In summer, Ochir's fat sheep are not afraid of mosquitoes and flies; in winter, the colder the weather, the fatter the fed sheep become...
    For the cooperative, Ochir dedicated all his energy. The Party and the people gave a high evaluation of his contribution. In 1949, Ochir was selected as an advanced herdsman. From 1950, he served as a delegate to the Great People's Hural for several terms and also won the Gold Star Medal and the Sukhe Bator Medal. In 1959, he won the lofty title of Labor Hero.
    Ochir said that since there has been a cooperative, my life has been getting better day by day. Cooperatives have more people and greater strength, there is a reasonable division of labor, and planned development of production; there are sheds and pens, winter feed, and animal husbandry and veterinary stations... All these provide the best conditions for me to make a little achievement. In the past, when I herded sheep for the herdlord, I was beaten and suffered, sometimes full and sometimes hungry, and no one cared if I died of exhaustion. Now, I have just made a small achievement, and the Party and the government have given me great encouragement. I will never forget these kindnesses in my life. I am determined to dedicate my entire life to the cooperative and to the country's animal husbandry.
    In the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative, there are many other herdsmen like Ochir: advanced lambing worker Dandar, who manages 526 ewes and received 536 lambs, with a survival rate of 100%. Milkmaid Tsende Zhab, whose average milk yield per cow last year reached 652 liters, more than twice that of ordinary milkmaids. In recent years, Ochir has grazed more than 1,000 sheep, consistently maintaining the highest record; this year, his apprentice Tubden grazed more than 1,500 sheep, all of which are fat and round, breaking the master's record... Due to their efforts, the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative has continued to gain consolidation and development. The Provincial Party Committee of Bulgan Province sent Comrade Oiyodob, one of the former Provincial Party Secretaries, to lead this cooperative. Now, the cooperative has a total of 598 members and more than 60,000 livestock. The cooperative is divided into two livestock production teams and one comprehensive production team, and Oyilig is the captain of the comprehensive production team. They have already established a grain and feed base with a sowing area of more than 600 hectares, and are currently stepping up the construction of settlement work.
    In the early days of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, Lenin repeatedly talked about the issue of Mongolia's transition from feudalism to socialism, bypassing the stage of capitalism. Lenin pointed out that cooperation is one of the basic links in this development. It was the "Lenin's Road" Cooperative and some other early cooperatives that, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, resolutely followed the direction indicated by Lenin, and walked a happy road to socialism on the vast grassland. With their glorious example, they attracted the vast number of herdsmen and laid the initial foundation for the collectivization of animal husbandry. The responsible comrade of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Mongolian People's Republic said: When the quantity accumulates to a certain extent, there will be a qualitative change. At the end of the second five-year plan (1957), 35% of Mongolian herders had joined cooperatives. In 1958, the Third Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party made a resolution to accelerate the collectivization of agriculture and animal husbandry, and took a series of measures to promote the collectivization movement, quickly setting off a high tide of comprehensive collectivization throughout the country. In 1959, the collectivization of agriculture and animal husbandry was basically realized throughout the country.
    On June 18 this year, Comrade Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, talked about the significance of Mongolia's comprehensive realization of agricultural and livestock collectivization when meeting with voters in Ulan Bator. He pointed out that the path of individual Mongolian herders towards the socialist collective economy is a historical event that can be equated with the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution in 1921. Comrade Tsedenbal said that this social change in agriculture and animal husbandry in the Mongolian People's Republic took a long time, made considerable preparations, and the Party and the people made tenacious efforts.
    When I returned to Ulan Bator and read these words, the lovely images of Oyilig, Ochir, and many heroic figures on the Mongolian grasslands appeared before my eyes one by one.

    草原英雄
    本报记者　周毅之
    6月里，在一个晴朗的日子，我们怀着兴奋的心情，去访问蒙古有名的老合作社——“列宁之路”合作社。
    傍晚，汽车走到一片宽阔的草场。火红的夕阳挨近了地平线，几片轻纱般的桃色云彩，在水一样柔和的天空中飘荡。金黄色的草原上，一位蒙古姑娘，骑着骏马，在一大群绵羊周围矫健地来回奔跑。太阳照在她那黑黝黝的圆脸上，照在她的紫红袍子上，从远处看去，像一朵红霞在雪白的羊群前面闪动。
    我正在赞赏这如画的草原景色，同行的蒙古同志忽然兴奋地高呼：“咱们快到合作社中心了！”
    果然，汽车再走十几分钟，眼前就出现一大片蒙古包，中间还夹杂着许多木屋和瓦房。那里有合作社和苏木（县）的办公室，有奶油加工厂，有饭店、学校、体育场。广场上堆满木料和砖瓦，几座新建房屋，比原有的房子都要高大。离广场不远，有一圈木栅栏，牧民们正在羊群里剪羊毛。合作社旁边的畜牧业机器站，停放着一排排高大的联合收割机和轻巧的畜力打草机；刚从地里回来的拖拉机，像一群铁牛在草场上爬行，发出轰隆的响声……。在茫茫的草原上走了一整天，忽然看到这一片热腾腾的、充满着生命活力的、繁忙欢乐的景象，我们每个人心里都有说不出的高兴。
    合作社主任奥依道布告诉我们：“列宁之路”合作社是布拉干省的第一个合作社，它曾经有过一段曲折的斗争历史。他指着旁边的一位同志说：“这是奥依力格同志，他就是这个社的创办人和第一任社长。”
    奥依力格有着蒙古人壮健的体型。长挂脸、大颧骨、高鼻梁，个子又高又大，腰粗，胳膊粗，身体非常结实，很像那达木大会上的摔跤家。革命前他是封建主的奴隶，后来参加蒙古人民革命党闹翻身，曾在部队里干过几年，复员后党就派他到布拉干省的布拉干苏木工作。
    他开始给我们讲合作社的斗争历史。
    1939年4月，布拉干省阿布查克苏木的一些党团员，在众议纷纭的情况下，得到布拉干苏木主席奥依力格的积极支持，邀集了二十五个男女牧民，成立布拉干省的第一个牧业生产合作社——“雄鹰”社。社员们推举奥依力格做社长，上级也同意调他去专搞合作社。
    那时，这里的人对合作社有各式各样的看法。
    有人说：“这是好事，‘众人拾柴火焰高’，合作社将来一定有前途。”
    有人说：“看他们干一个时候再说。”
    有些富裕牧民却在背地里讲怪话。他们说：“等着瞧吧，这些人胡闹一阵，把牲畜合并起来，结果给自己和国家带来损失，不打架分家才怪。”一些反动分子更是拼命造谣污蔑，企图打击社干部，搞垮合作社。
    地方上有些基层干部对合作社也缺乏认识，他们把好草场划给个体牧民，要合作社社员到三、四百公里以外的坏草场去放牧牲畜。
    尽管这样，穷苦的牧民是喜欢合作社的。第二年，“雄鹰”社已经有一百多社员。布拉干省也先后出现好几个合作社。乌兰巴托来了个特派员，他检查了各合作社的工作，同意
  “雄鹰”社继续办下去。可是，过几天，奥依力格却被传到苏木去。他走进苏木主席办公室，看见苏木主席、特派员和另外一个人坐在那里。
    “你在搞什么反动活动？”那个人怒气冲冲地问。
    “我办合作社，不是反动活动。”奥依力格理直气壮地说。
    “你盗窃了多少公共财产？”那个人接着问。
    “合作社的基金只有几百图格里克（蒙币），我什么也没有盗窃。”奥依力格答。
    那个人继续恶狠狠地吆骂着，还转过去对特派员说：“你看，你的阴谋活动嚣张到什么程度？”
    特派员也非常生气，他从口袋里掏出一张纸，甩在桌上，大声反驳：“你不要随便胡说。我的工作是完全合法的，这是党中央的指示。”
    那个人更冒火了，他下命令：“把奥依力格关起来。”就这样，奥依力格莫名其妙地蹲了四十五天监狱。后来大家才知道，原来那个坏蛋是个隐藏在革命队伍里的反革命分子。
    在审讯的时候，奥依力格提出抗议。法院也认为他没有罪。出狱后，奥依力格仍然继续办他的合作社。
    那时，合作社的各种制度还不健全，社里头很乱。奥依力格觉得自己没有文化，办法不多，面对着一大堆困难，有时心里不免着慌。但是，他并没有动摇。他想：过去封建主还没有打倒的时候，困难不比现在大得多吗？我是一个党员，不能被这一点困难吓倒。
    奥依力格说：“在那艰苦的年月里，有一件事使我终身难忘。”那事情发生在他出狱后的第二年，布拉干省的省委书记来到合作社。他到处走，到处仔细地看，还问奥依力格今后打算怎样办。奥依力格说，合作社想成立党支部，建设一个奶油加工厂，买一部拖拉机，聘请一位文化教员。省委书记走后，奥依力格的心一直忐忑不安。他觉得合作社有不少缺点，社里的福利设备很差，许多该为社员办的事他想到了，却没有力量做……。
    过了不久，省里派来三个同志，他们交给奥依力格一封信。他心里想，这次可能挨批评。拆开信一看，哪知道竟是省委表扬“雄鹰”社的决议。决议首先祝贺布拉干省第一个畜牧业生产合作社的诞生，并且指出，这是本省牧民走上社会主义道路的开端。省委批评地方基层组织过去没有支持合作社；批准了奥依力格的几项请求，还拨给合作社一部拖拉机，派三个干部下来帮助工作。奥依力格一面读，一面流着感激的眼泪。他说，我读完省委的决议，高兴得心都要跳出来了。
    工作中虽然有不少困难，但是，大多数贫苦牧民都积极支持合作社。他们不怕艰难，不辞劳苦，努力完成社里的各种生产任务。奥依力格就在党的领导下，紧紧地团结他们，克服了各种困难，搞好生产，使合作社一天比一天巩固，并且不断地扩大社会主义的阵地。“列宁之路”合作社的前身就是“雄鹰”社，这一带的“和平”、“劳动”、“曙光”等几个合作社，也都是当时“雄鹰”社的一个生产队发展起来的。
    从奥依力格的谈话中，我们知道，“列宁之路”合作社有一位老牧民，名叫奥其尔。他是蒙古人民共和国农牧业方面的第一个劳动英雄，也是当年“雄鹰”社的创办人之一。在最艰苦的年月，奥其尔是那些积极支持合作社的贫苦牧民中最积极的老社员。
    奥其尔今年五十五岁，十三岁就给牧主当长工。他从小就在这块草地上牧羊、骑马、打猎。他的生活，他的性格，就是在这环境下培养起来的。这个牧民的心像冬天的积雪一样纯洁，身体像石头一样坚实，感情像火一样燃烧。当他还是牧主的长工，夫妻俩住在一个破烂的小蒙古包的时候，他宁可摘下自己帐篷顶上那张唯一完整的毡子，换取一只山羊，杀给过路投宿的穷朋友吃，也不肯叫朋友饿着肚子过夜。革命胜利后，奥其尔成为牧场的主人，给自己的合作社牧羊，他冒着狂暴的风雪，一夜又一夜地跟羊群在一起度过严寒的冬天。奥其尔就是这样一种人，随时都可以把自己的整个心灵，献给他所爱的人，献给他所效忠的事业。
    当合作社初办的时候，劳动力很少，奥其尔一个人管二千多只羊，让其他社员腾出力量干别的活。当党和政府号召牧民努力增加畜产品的时候，他就整天琢磨，怎样才能使牲畜多长肉，多出毛。羊在牧场上吃草，奥其尔不避严寒酷暑，不怕风霜雨雪，总是跟着畜群认真地观察，积累了丰富的牧羊经验。在别人看来，好像草原上到处都长着一样的青草。但是，奥其尔却能看出，哪些草羊吃了长膘，哪些草不行。为了叫羊吃得好，奥其尔仔细选择草地，有计划地调动牧场。他一次又一次搬迁自己的帐篷，从来不嫌劳累。
    奥其尔像熟悉自己的孩子一样，熟悉他所养育的羊群。他跟它们说话，骂它们，疼它们，尽心尽意地看管它们。奥其尔牧羊，一年四季都有不同的方法。夏天，一大清早，他就放羊出去吃草；中午天气热，让羊群到荫凉的地方歇晌；晚上，直到什么都看不见了，才赶羊回家。雨后草湿，羊吃了就不让再多喝水，以防坏肚子。天气闷热的时候，赶着羊群逆风走，让它们出汗，能多长肉。冬天，羊已经长胖，放牧时不让快跑，要它们慢慢走，好保住羊膘。奥其尔放牧的羊，一年四季都很胖。母畜肥壮，生出小羊羔结实，能抵抗疾病，毛多奶也多。夏季，奥其尔的肥羊，不怕蚊蝇咬；冬季，天气越冷，吃饱的羊群越上膘……。
    为了合作社，奥其尔献出了他的全部精力。党和人民对他的贡献给予很高的评价。1949年，奥其尔被选为先进牧民。从1950年起，他连任了几届大人民呼拉尔代表，还得了金星勋章和苏赫巴托尔勋章。1959年，他荣获劳动英雄的崇高称号。
    奥其尔说，自从有了合作社，我的生活就一天比一天好。合作社人多力量大，有合理分工，有计划发展生产；有棚圈，有过冬饲料，有畜牧兽医站……。所有这些，都提供了最好的条件，使我能够做出一点成绩。过去，我给牧主放羊，挨打受气，一顿饱一顿饥，累死了也没有人过问。现在，我刚刚做出一小点成绩，党和政府就给我极大的鼓励。这些恩情，我一辈子都不会忘记。我决心把我的整个生命献给合作社，献给祖国的畜牧事业。
    在“列宁之路”合作社，还有许多奥其尔式的牧民：先进接羔员丹达尔，管五百二十六只母羊，接了五百三十六只羊羔，成活率百分之一百。挤奶员曾德札布，去年平均每头奶牛的挤奶量达到六百五十二公升，比一般挤奶员多二倍以上。最近几年奥其尔放牧一千多只羊，一直保持着最高纪录；今年，他的徒弟图布登放牧一千五百多只羊，全都胖得滚圆，突破了师傅的纪录……。由于他们的努力，“列宁之路”合作社不断地获得巩固和发展。布拉干省省委派了前省委书记之一奥依道布同志下来领导这个社。现在，全社共有五百九十八户社员，六万多牲畜。社里分两个畜牧业生产队和一个综合生产队，奥依力格是综合生产队的队长。他们已经建立了一个播种面积六百多公顷的粮食和饲料基地，目前正在加紧进行定居的建设工作。
    在蒙古人民革命胜利的初期，列宁曾屡次谈到蒙古从封建主义越过资本主义发展阶段向社会主义过渡的问题。列宁指出，合作化是这个发展的基本环节之一。正是“列宁之路”合作社和另外一些早期成立的合作社，在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，坚决地遵循着列宁所指示的方向，在茫茫无际的草原上走出了一条通向社会主义的幸福大道。它们用自己的光辉榜样，吸引着广大的牧民，打下了畜牧业合作化的最初的基础。蒙古人民共和国农牧部的负责同志说：数量积累到一定程度，就会产生质的变化。第二个五年计划结束时（1957年），蒙古有了35％的牧户加入合作社。1958年，蒙古人民革命党第三次代表大会作出加速农牧业合作化的决议，并且采取了一系列促进合作化运动的措施，很快就在全国范围内掀起了全面合作化的高潮。1959年，全国基本上实现了农牧业合作化。
    今年6月18日，蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔同志在乌兰巴托会见选民时，曾经谈到蒙古全面实现农牧业合作化的意义。他指出：蒙古的个体牧户走上社会主义集体经济的道路，这是可以和1921年蒙古人民革命胜利相等同的历史性事件。泽登巴尔同志说，蒙古人民共和国农牧业中出现的这种社会变革，曾经花了很长的时间，作了相当的准备，党和人民进行了顽强的努力。
    当我回乌兰巴托读到这些话的时候，奥依力格、奥其尔和蒙古草原上许多英雄人物的可爱的形象，又一个个地出现在我的眼前。
