Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Burhan, Chairman of the China Islamic Association, sent a telegram to Ghalib bin Ali, Imam of Oman, on "Oman Day," representing Chinese Muslims in firmly supporting the just struggle of the Omani people against British imperialism. The telegram stated that the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist bloc, headed by the United States, are now facing increasingly strong opposition from the people of all countries in the world. The massive struggle against imperialism and colonialism launched by the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. We firmly believe that the Omani people, with the close unity and mutual support of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as the people of all countries in the world, will surely be able to drive British imperialism out of Oman. Final victory will surely belong to the Omani people.
