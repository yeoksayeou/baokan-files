Yunnan's Pig Population Steadily Increases
Various Localities Adopt Methods Such as "Planting, Retaining, By-products, Work, Gathering" to Vigorously Store Feed

(Our newspaper, Kunming, 19th) The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the mass movement of raising pigs by the whole people, resolutely implemented the guiding principles and policies of public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and equal emphasis on both, with production teams as the main force in the public raising sector. It also firmly grasped detailed and specific measures, especially focusing on feed, which promoted the high-speed development of pig production. After slaughtering a large number of pigs during the New Year and Spring Festival, the province's pig inventory in May of this year still increased by a net of 200,000 heads compared to the end of last year.

The realization of people's communes has promoted the development of pig raising across Yunnan Province, especially the public raising sector, which has seen even greater growth in numbers. At the end of last year, out of the seven million and five hundred pigs raised in the province, collectively raised pigs accounted for 50.4%, while privately raised pigs accounted for 49.6%. The Provincial Committee at the time analyzed the pig raising situation in the province, believing that organizations at all levels of the commune had the potential to raise pigs, and that the greatest potential lay in the production teams. Based on this instruction, people's communes, management districts, and production teams actively established pig farms, raised feed, carried out breeding and mating, reformed feeding tools, and other work to ensure the development of pigs. In addition to the widespread establishment of small-scale pig farms by production teams and canteens, the communes and management districts alone established 80,000 collective pig farms. People's communes also established breeding and epidemic prevention institutions, seizing the golden season of spring mating this spring. Out of more than 1.26 million sows, 800,000 achieved full mating and pregnancy. In May alone, 300,000 piglets were born. Due to the large-scale establishment of collective pig raising, and the appropriate development of private pig raising, pig production this year has achieved rapid development, especially the collective pig raising, which has increased the fastest. The number of publicly raised pigs in the province has increased from more than 3.52 million at the end of last year to more than 4.84 million, increasing from 50.4% of the total number of pigs to 77.6%.

The high-speed development of collective pig raising in Yunnan is mainly due to the implementation of the policy of focusing on production teams. Because the production team is the main force, the masses can obtain obvious and direct benefits after the increase in pig production, which has stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres, commune members, and breeders. It also fully utilizes the favorable conditions of the production teams, such as a good foundation for pig raising, more experience, and simple equipment. In the past, the Renhe Commune's Huilong Management District in Xundian County did not resolutely implement this policy, and the average monthly increase in pigs was only 3.5% for four months. After implementing this policy, the number of pigs increased by 12.4% in one month.

All localities have also, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Committee, focused on pig raising in public canteens. Most areas have combined canteen pig raising with production team pig raising. The method is that the production team arranges a certain amount of labor to be responsible for feeding, and all the rice water, vegetable tops, and vegetable scraps from the canteen are used as feed for the pig farm; in addition to completing the assigned purchase tasks, the fattened pigs can be appropriately consumed by the canteen.

While resolutely implementing the pig raising policy, the Yunnan Provincial Committee firmly grasped feed, this key measure. In the past six months, all localities have been focusing on feed as they focus on grain, and arranging feed land as they arrange grain land. All localities have summarized the methods for grasping feed, mainly including "planting, retaining, by-products, work, gathering" and other methods. Planting means planting high-yield feed on a large scale. The province plans to use three million mu of land as a feed base, most of which is reclaimed or newly opened wasteland. At present, the province has planted 2.59 million mu of high-yield feed. Retaining means retaining a certain amount of grain as concentrated feed for pigs in the distribution of the major and minor harvests, and implementing special warehouse management and special grain for special purposes. By-products mean using grain by-products to feed pigs. Work means using by-products such as distiller's grains and tofu dregs to feed pigs. Gathering means collecting and silageing wild feed, "bringing back what's on the mountains, picking up what's in the lakes, picking up what's on the ground, and picking what's on the trees." This year, the province has stored about 3.5 billion catties of wild feed, an increase of nearly one time compared to the same period last year.

### 公养为主私养为辅  集体养猪狠抓小队  云南养猪数量稳步上升  各地采取“种、留、副、工、采”等方法大力储备饲料

    公养为主私养为辅  集体养猪狠抓小队
    云南养猪数量稳步上升
    各地采取“种、留、副、工、采”等方法大力储备饲料
    本报昆明19日电 中共云南省委在全民养猪的群众运动中坚决贯彻公养为主、私养为辅，公养、私养并举，公养部分以生产小队为主的方针政策，并狠抓细抓各项具体措施，特别是大抓饲料，促进了生猪高速度发展。全省在新年、春节屠宰大量生猪后，今年5月份生猪存栏数仍较去年年底净增二十万头。
    人民公社化的实现，促进了云南全省养猪事业的发展，特别是公养部分增长数量更大。去年年底全省饲养的七百万零五百多头生猪中，集体饲养的就占50.4％，社员私养的占49.6％。省委当时分析了全省养猪情况，认为公社各级组织都有养猪潜力，而潜力最大的是生产小队。根据这一指示，人民公社、管理区、生产小队积极兴办猪场、筹集饲料，开展繁殖配种、改革饲养工具等工作，保证生猪发展，全省除生产小队和食堂普遍兴办小型养猪场外，仅公社、管理区就办了集体猪场八万个。人民公社并且建立了配种、防疫机构，今春抓紧春配的黄金季节，一百二十六万多头母猪中，八十万头实现了满配满怀，仅5月份就产仔三十万头。由于大办集体养猪，同时适当发展私人养猪，今年生猪生产获得了迅速发展，其中特别是集体养猪增加最快。全省公养猪已由去年底的三百五十二万多头增加到四百八十四万多头，由占生猪总数的50.4％提高到77.6％。
    云南集体养猪获得高速度发展，主要是实行了以生产小队为主的政策。由于以生产小队为主，生猪增产后群众可以得到明显的、直接的利益，激发了干部、社员和饲养员的积极性，同时也充分地发挥了小队原来养猪基础好、经验多、设备因陋就简等有利条件。寻甸县仁德公社回龙管理区原来贯彻这一政策不够坚决，四个月生猪平均每月只增加3.5％，贯彻这一政策后，一个月生猪就增加12.4％ 。
    各地还都根据省委的指示，狠抓公共食堂养猪。多数地区都把食堂养猪和生产小队养猪结合起来。办法是生产队安排一定的劳动力负责喂养，食堂的米泔水、菜头菜尾等全归猪场作饲料；所养肥猪除完成派购任务外，可以由食堂适当食用一部分。
    在坚决贯彻养猪政策的同时，云南省委狠抓饲料这一关键性的措施。半年以来，各地都像抓粮食一样抓饲料，像安排粮食一样安排饲料地。各地都总结了抓饲料的方法，主要是“种、留、副、工、采”等几种。种，就是大种高产饲料。全省计划用三百万亩地作为饲料的基地，这些饲料地大部分是已开或新开的荒地。目前全省已种下高产饲料二百五十九万亩。留，就是在大小春分配中，留下一定数量的粮食作生猪的精饲料，并实行专仓管理，专粮专用。副，是利用粮食副产物喂猪。工，是利用酒糟、豆腐渣等副业加工副产品喂猪。采，是采集和青贮野生饲料，“把山上的找回来，湖里的捞起来，地上的拣起来，树上的摘下来”，全省今年已储备野生饲料约三十五亿斤，比去年同期增加将近一倍。
