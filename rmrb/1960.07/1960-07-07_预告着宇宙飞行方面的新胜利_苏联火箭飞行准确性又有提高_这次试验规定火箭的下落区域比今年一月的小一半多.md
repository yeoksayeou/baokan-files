Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: The impact area designated by the Soviet Union for the rocket launched into the Pacific this time is more than half the size of that in January of this year, indicating further improvement in the accuracy of rocket flights. This new test will herald new victories in space flight.

This was stated by Soviet scientist Dr. Pokrovsky in a recent interview published in the Soviet "Naval Gazette." In recent days, Soviet newspapers have successively published articles and interviews related to this issue.

A spokesman for the Soviet Ministry of Merchant Marine stated in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" that the rocket impact area designated in January was 270 nautical miles long and 160 nautical miles wide, with an area of 43,200 square nautical miles; the area designated this time is 168 nautical miles long and 102 nautical miles wide, with an area of 17,136 square nautical miles.

The selected rocket impact area is far from shipping and air routes, as well as fishing areas. This area is approximately 600 nautical miles from Johnston Island and Howland Island, both of which have American military bases. It is slightly closer to Palmyra Island, which has an American military radio station. The larger island in the nearby area is Christmas Island, which has a British military base.

Soviet renowned space flight expert Sternfeld pointed out that the new target area has shifted slightly southeast compared to the previous target area. It is farther from the center of the Marshall Islands. Two-thirds of this rocket impact area is located within the January test area. The center of the new area is approximately 200 kilometers southeast of the center of the previous test area. Its distance from the western border of the Soviet Union is 13,000 kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: Many Soviet newspapers published articles on the 6th reporting on the experimental situation of three animals on board the recently launched high-altitude and space exploration rocket. These articles stated that the Soviet Union's launch of the high-altitude and space exploration rocket was a most successful launch, and the landing of the animals and instruments was a most successful landing. No injuries were found on the animals, not even the slightest bruising.

The articles stated that the two puppies sent into space were named "Brave" and "Little Fish," and the rabbit was named "Little Star." "Brave" has flown for the fifth time. During the fourth and fifth flights, the puppy's weight increased due to enhanced feeding. Before the flight, the animals underwent a series of training on the ground, such as learning to stay in the small slots of the rocket cabin in a prescribed posture. During the flight, all three animals wore "space" suits. "Little Fish," being its first flight, was not yet accustomed to it and initially tried to break free, but under the influence of the puppy "Brave," it quickly calmed down. Throughout the two-hour flight, the condition of all three animals was recorded.

    预告着宇宙飞行方面的新胜利
    苏联火箭飞行准确性又有提高
    这次试验规定火箭的下落区域比今年一月的小一半多
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联这次规定向太平洋发射火箭的下落区域比今年1月的要小一半多，这说明火箭飞行的准确性又提高了。这次新试验将预告着宇宙飞行方面的新的胜利。
    这是苏联科学家波克罗夫斯基博士最近在苏联“海军报”上发表谈话时说的。在最近几天，苏联报纸陆续发表了一些有关这一问题的文章和谈话。
    苏联海运部发言人在“共青团真理报”上发表谈话说，今年1月规定的火箭下落区域长二百七十海里、宽一百六十海里，面积是四万三千二百平方海里；这次规定的区域长一百六十八海里，宽一百零二海里，面积是一万七千一百三十六平方海里。
    这次选定的火箭下落区域离船只和飞机的航线以及捕鱼区域都很远。这个区域离约翰斯敦岛和豪兰岛各约有六百海里，这两岛上都有美军基地。其次离设有美军用电台的巴尔米拉岛稍近一些。在附近地区较大的岛是圣诞岛。岛上设有英国军事基地。
    苏联著名宇宙飞行学家斯特恩菲尔德指出，新的目标区比上次的目标区往东南偏移了一些。它离马绍尔群岛中心更远了一些。这次火箭下落区有三分之二位于1月的试验区中。新区域中心离上次试验区中心东南约二百公里。它同苏联西部疆界的距离是一万三千公里。
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联许多报纸6日刊载了文章，报道苏联新近发射的高空和宇宙考察火箭上三个动物作试验的情况。这些文章说，苏联发射的高空和宇宙考察火箭，是一次最成功的发射，其中动物和仪器的着陆是一次最成功的着陆，动物身上没有发现任何损伤，甚至连一点点血瘀现象都没有。
    文章说，这次上天的两只小狗名叫“勇士”和“小鱼”，兔子名叫“小星”。“勇士”这次已是第五次飞行，在第四次和第五次飞行期间，这只小狗由于加强喂养，体重有了增加。在飞行前动物在地面上经过了一系列训练，如学会以规定的姿势呆在火箭舱里的小槽中等。在飞行时，三个动物都穿上了“宇宙”服，小狗“小鱼”因为是第一次飞行，所以还不习惯，开始时想挣脱出来，但在小狗“勇士”的影响下，迅速平静下来。在整个飞行的两小时内，这三个动物的一切情况都被记录下来。
