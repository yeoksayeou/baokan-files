　　A Good Slogan: "Stock Up on Provisions"
　　Ore and coal are the "provisions" of steel production. The slogan "Stock up on provisions for steel production" put forward by the Guangxi transportation department is an important slogan to ensure the continued growth of steel production.

　　People's revolutionary drive must be boosted. Without sufficient drive, production cannot increase substantially. However, drive must be combined with certain material conditions to be fully effective. For example, if steelworkers have ample drive and sufficient "provisions," the heroes will have a place to use their skills, and the sustained rise in production will be guaranteed.

　　The steel production department is a continuous production department. It must not only ensure that it is well-fed now, but also have a surplus and reserves for turnover. At present, the potential for steel production is very large. First, it is necessary to increase the utilization coefficient of existing blast furnaces on a large scale; second, a large number of small and medium-sized blast furnaces that have been built must be put into production; and third, the small blast furnaces that are being built will soon be put into operation. "Before the troops and horses move, provisions go first." All this requires the transportation department to transport more and better ore and coal to the steel front so that steel production units can eat their fill and have a surplus.

　　Can this be done? Absolutely. Consider this: Jiangxi Province is focusing on ore transportation, ensuring that blast furnaces will not stop production even if no ore is transported for three days; the transportation front and the workers of various iron mines in Shandong Province are working together to strengthen the transportation of iron ore. At present, steel production units throughout the province have an average of about thirteen days' worth of ore reserves... The achievements are great, and there are many methods. These good news make us even more confident that steel production will have even greater growth in the second half of this year.

　　Comrades on the transportation front, in order to ensure the continued growth of steel production, we must boost our drive even more, do everything possible, and transport more and better "provisions" to the steel "front" before the rainy season arrives. This is an urgent task that must be done well!

### 一个好口号：“备足粮草”

    一个好口号：“备足粮草”
    矿石和煤炭，是钢铁生产的“粮草”。广西交通运输部门提出的“为钢铁生产备足粮草”的口号，是一个保证钢铁生产持续增长的重要口号。
    人的革命干劲要鼓足，干劲不足，生产不可能大幅度增长。但是，干劲要和一定的物质条件相结合，才能充分发挥作用。比如，炼铁工人有了充沛的干劲，又有了充足的“粮草”，英雄就有了用武之地了，生产的持续上升就有保证了。
    钢铁生产部门是一个连续不断的生产部门，不仅要保证目前吃饱吃好，还要吃饱有余，有储备，可以周转。当前钢铁生产的潜力很大，一是要大面积地提高现有高炉的利用系数；二是已经建成的大批中小高炉要投入生产；三是正在新建的小高炉不久就要跃马上阵。“兵马未动，粮草先行”，这一切都要求交通运输部门为钢铁战线运送更多更好的矿石和煤炭，使钢铁生产单位能吃饱有余。
    这能不能做到呢？完全能。请看：江西省各地狠抓矿石运输，保证了高炉三天不运矿石，不会停止生产；山东省交通运输战线和各铁矿山的职工，同心协力加强铁矿石运输，目前全省各钢铁生产单位平均已有十三天左右的矿石储备量……。成绩很大，办法很多。这些好消息，使我们更加相信今年下半年钢铁生产一定会有更大的增长。
    交通运输战线上的职工同志们，为了保证钢铁生产的持续增长，要把干劲鼓的更足，千方百计，在雨季到来之前，运送更多更好的“粮草”到钢铁“前线”去，这是一个迫切的任务，一定要努力办好！
