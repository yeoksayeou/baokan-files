Title: "Striving" and "Yielding"

"Yielding upon seeing honor" is a slogan put forward by Ma Xueli, a famous innovation expert. These few words shine with the brilliant light of communist style. This noble communist style is now visible everywhere in our country, becoming a common practice.

Whether to strive for or yield personal honor reflects two completely different worldviews.

Striving for personal "honor" is the worldview of the exploiting classes. In the eyes of the exploiting classes, so-called "honor" is nothing more than the two big words "fame" and "profit." They are bound by fame and locked by profit, pursuing them tirelessly. Confucius's saying "A gentleman worries about not being praised after his death," and Sima Qian's saying "Establishing a name is the ultimate of conduct," are regarded as the golden rule. Their love of fame is so deep that they even reach the point of "Forty years of dukes and marquises, even in dreams, it is still romantic." People with this kind of consciousness join the revolution to seek fame and reputation; there is no place for nameless heroes, and they drill wherever they can show off. After doing a little work, they become complacent and boast about themselves, afraid that others will not know. In order to compete for fame and gain, they can use any means, elevate themselves, attack others, "hold back" from others, be jealous of others' honors, and even attempt to seize others' honors for themselves. Aren't some people thrown off the train of revolution precisely because they indulge in pursuing personal "honor"? This is a decadent ideology, and we should thoroughly sweep away this pile of garbage left over from the old society.

The working class is a thoroughly revolutionary class, bearing the great historical mission of eliminating capitalism, establishing a communist society, and liberating all mankind. The class status and historical mission of the working class enable them to be the most selfless, the most united and cooperative, with the broadest mind and the greatest courage; they have no selfish thoughts of seeking personal fame and gain, or competing for personal honor, only a red heart dedicated to the selfless struggle for the cause of communism. In 1958, Ma Xueli achieved twenty-eight technical innovations, and in 1959, he achieved more than sixty innovations and creations. The whirlwind milling reciprocating stroke cutting method and the milling open-end screw alone could create wealth of more than 160,000 yuan for the country in one year. However, he rarely filled out forms and reported them himself, but secretly recorded the credit to others. When others discovered this and asked him, his reply was very simple: "As long as the production key is solved, what difference does it make whether you or I are praised?" How simple this sentence is, but it contains such a noble and valuable communist spirit!

People with a proletarian worldview regard being a nameless hero as the greatest happiness and joy. They respect others and have no jealousy; they are willing to help others gain honor, while they "yield upon seeing honor." Every cell in their body is permeated with the communist spirit, completely dissolving "praising you" and "praising me," "collective honor" and "personal honor" together, so that when they see others gain honor, they are sincerely happy, as if they themselves have gained honor.

Marxism does not oppose "striving" for honor in general terms. Ma Xueli's "yielding" personal honor is actually "striving" for collective honor. We should not only "not give way" to collective honor but also strive for it. Of course, there are differences in the size of collectives, and sometimes we have to "yield" the honor of small collectives and "strive" for the honor of large collectives. Here, we need to correctly resolve the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the part and the whole. In the eyes of revolutionary heroes, the honor of the motherland, the Party, and the collective is their own honor. They wholeheartedly strive for the greatest honor for the Party and the people; if anyone dares to undermine this honor, they will resolutely fight to defend it. People who yield upon seeing honor receive the Party's praise and rewards, and the people's respect and love, and actually gain greater honor. On the contrary, individual heroes exaggerate the role of the individual, attribute any achievements to themselves, oppose personal honor to the honor of the Party and the collective, strive for personal honor, and retreat from striving for the honor of the Party and the collective, sometimes even opposing it. This is the fundamental difference between revolutionary heroism and individual heroism.

Regarding honor, "strive" or "yield"? What should be "strived" for? What should be "yielded"? Why strive? Why "yield"? Obviously, we must have a correct worldview to find the correct answer.

### “争”和“让”

    “争”和“让”
　　谢平
    “见荣誉就让”，这是著名革新能手马学礼提出的一个口号。寥寥五字，闪烁着共产主义风格的灿烂光芒。这种崇高的共产主义风格，现在在我国到处可见，蔚然成风。
    对待个人荣誉，是争是让，反映了两种截然不同的世界观。
    争个人“荣誉”，是剥削阶级的世界观。在剥削阶级眼里，所谓“荣誉”无非是“名”、“利”两个大字。他们名缰利锁，孜孜以求。孔子说的“君子疾没世而名不称焉”，司马迁说的“立名者，行之极也”，被奉为圭臬。他们好名之深，甚至达到了“四十年来公与侯，纵然作梦也风流”的地步。有这种意识的人，参加革命是为了沽名钓誉，无名英雄没有他的份，能出风头的地方到处钻。做了一点工作，就沾沾自喜，自吹自擂，生怕人家不知道。为了争名夺利，可以不择手段，抬高自己，打击别人，对人“留一手”，嫉妒别人的荣誉，甚至妄图攫取别人的荣誉为己有。有些人，不就是因为沉溺于追逐个人“荣誉”，而被摔出了革命的列车么？这是一种腐朽的意识形态，我们应该彻底扫除这堆旧社会残留下来的垃圾。
    工人阶级是彻底革命的阶级，它担负着消灭资本主义，建立共产主义社会，解放全人类的伟大历史使命。工人阶级的阶级地位和历史使命，使他们能够最大公无私，最团结互助，有最开畅的胸怀，最伟大的气魄；决无求个人名利、争个人荣誉的私念，只有一颗为共产主义事业忘我奋斗的赤心。马学礼在1958年实现了二十八项技术革新，在1959年又实现了六十多项革新创造，其中仅旋风铣往返行程吃刀法和铣开口螺丝两项，一年就能为国家创造财富十六万多元。但是，他自己很少填表上报，却把功劳暗地记在别人身上。当别人发觉后问他时，他的答复很简单：“只要生产关键解决了，表扬你我又有什么不同呢？”这句话多么朴素，但又蕴藏着多么崇高、可贵的共产主义精神啊！
    具有无产阶级世界观的人，就是这样把作一个无名英雄视为最大的幸福和愉快。他们尊重别人，绝无嫉妒之心；甘心帮助别人得到荣誉，自己则“见荣誉就让”。他们身上的每个细胞都浸透着共产主义精神，把“表扬你”和“表扬我”“集体荣誉”和“个人荣誉”完全溶化在一起了，以至在见到别人获得荣誉时，衷心喜悦，好像自己获得荣誉一样。
    马克思主义并不笼统地反对“争”荣誉。马学礼“让”个人荣誉，其实是为“争”集体荣誉。对待集体荣誉不但“当仁不让”，而且要力争。当然，集体还有大小之分，有时，还得“让”小集体的荣誉，而“争”大集体的荣誉。这里需要正确地解决个人与集体、局部与整体的关系。在革命英雄主义者看来，祖国、党和集体的荣誉就是自己的荣誉，他们全心全意地为党为人民争取最大的荣誉；如果有谁胆敢破坏这种荣誉，他们就坚决为保卫这种荣誉而斗争。见荣誉就让的人，得到党的表扬奖励，得到人民的尊敬爱戴，实际上获得了更大的荣誉。相反，个人英雄主义者夸大个人作用，把任何一点成绩都记在自己头上，把个人荣誉同党和集体的荣誉对立起来，争个人荣誉，对党和集体荣誉则退而不争，有时甚至还要反一反。这就是革命英雄主义和个人英雄主义的根本区别。
    对待荣誉，“争”乎？“让”乎？何者该“争”？何者该“让”？何以要争？何以要“让”？显然要有正确的世界观，才会找出正确的答案。
