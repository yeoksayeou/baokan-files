When Comrade Zhao Hanqing was transferred to Quanji Commune in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province, to serve as the Party Committee Secretary, he was determined to go to the front line and mobilize cadres at all levels to go deep into the front line and lead production by directly participating in production. Not long after he arrived at the commune, he picked up his herding whip and began managing livestock with the other shepherds.

While grazing the livestock, he listened to the opinions of the masses and finally found the Muli Grassland, which had been designated as a "no-grazing zone" in the past.

The herds set off for Muli in batches, with Zhao Hanqing riding his horse at the front, leading the way. During the day, he followed the herds, providing political education to the shepherds while grazing. In the evening, he went from tent to tent, carrying out appraisal and competition campaigns between livestock herds and between shepherds. He brought the experience of this herd to that herd, and the lessons of that herd to this herd. His practical actions encouraged the shepherds, who all extended their daily grazing time and changed pastures every five or six days. Because the water and grass were good and the management was good, in just two months, the proportion of first-class fatness in all kinds of livestock jumped to over 95%, eliminating third-class fatness.

Comrade Zhao Hanqing's exemplary behavior educated and motivated cadres throughout the commune. Everyone went deep into the front line and took root in various livestock herds, greatly strengthening the leadership force at the front line. Four of the commune's five secretaries and deputy secretaries were assigned to be responsible for the leadership work of the major brigades, and they were frequently active in various grazing areas. Twenty-six cadres were stationed permanently in the production teams, concurrently serving as deputy captains, with one cadre leading one experimental livestock herd, participating in production and directing production. The cadres throughout the commune extensively carried out the "three-in-one (worker, shepherd, and disease prevention worker)" movement, and currently, thirty-six cadres have reached the level of being proficient in all three.

    书记当放牧员
    赵翰卿同志调到青海刚察县泉吉公社担任党委书记的时候，就下了决心，要到第一线去，并发动各级干部都深入第一线工作，以直接参加生产的方式来领导生产。他到公社不几天，就拿起牧鞭同放牧员一起管起牲畜来。
    他一边放牧一边听取群众意见，终于找到了过去被划为“禁牧区”的木里草原。
    畜群分批向木里出发了，赵翰卿骑马走在最前面开路。他白天跟着畜群转，一边放牧一边给放牧员进行政治教育，晚上从这个帐篷到那个帐篷，开展畜群之间和放牧员之间的评比竞赛运动。他把这个群的经验带到那个群，又把那个群的教训告诉这个群。他的实际行动鼓舞了放牧员，大家都延长每天放牧时间，五六天就换一次草场。水草好，经管好，只两个月时间，各类牲畜的一等膘就跃进到95％以上，消灭了三类膘。
    赵翰卿同志的模范行为教育和带动了全社干部，大家都纷纷深入第一线，到各个畜群扎根，第一线的领导力量大大加强。公社的五名正副书记，有四名分片包干各大队的领导工作，他们经常在各个放牧场活动。有二十六名干部长期驻在生产小队兼任副队长，一个干部带一个试验畜群，参加生产和指挥生产。全社干部广泛开展了“三员（工作员、放牧员、防疫员）结合”运动，目前已有三十六名干部达到“三员”兼备的水平。　　　　　　　（青纪）
