The Hefei Urban Commune Vigorously Increases Production of Non-Staple Foods
The citywide production of pigs, fish, and vegetables rises rapidly; some units have achieved self-sufficiency with surplus

(Our report) Hefei City, Anhui Province, in the process of establishing urban people's communes, gives full play to the superiority of the people's communes of being "large in size and collective in nature," and while vigorously grasping industrial production, also vigorously develops non-staple food production. In the past few months, non-staple food production has greatly developed. At present, the city's sown area for commercial vegetables has reached more than 78,000 mu, an increase of 50% compared with 1959. The daily market supply of vegetables reaches more than 540,000 jin, an increase of 54% compared with before the establishment of urban people's communes, and the varieties have reached more than 480 kinds. Since the first half of this year, the city has raised more than 129,000 pigs, and the current number of pigs in stock is still more than 92,000, and more than 780,000 poultry; more than 42 million fish have been raised. More than fifty units have achieved self-sufficiency in meat, and some units have a surplus. Some organs living in the Nanshi People's Commune, such as the General Office of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial Kindergarten, the Municipal Joint State-Private Brick and Tile Store, and the Xishiqu People's Court, raised more than 1,800 pigs from January to May this year.

The above achievements are the result of Hefei's urban people's communes earnestly implementing the principle of "relying mainly on self-reliance, striving for foreign aid as a supplement," strengthening leadership over non-staple food production, and launching mass movements to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. First, the Party committees at all levels adhered to putting politics in command and strengthened organizational leadership. The Municipal Party Committee assigned a standing committee member to specifically take charge of this work, and also transferred cadres from the provincial and municipal directly affiliated organs to establish a non-staple food production office. The secretaries in charge of managing life in various communes, branches, factories, organs, and schools generally took personal command and established leading bodies to vigorously grasp non-staple food production centered on vegetable growing and pig raising. Various communes and branches have formulated plans for developing non-staple food production and assigned specific personnel to be responsible, thereby ensuring the organized and led development of non-staple food production. Second, in order to ensure the realization of the self-sufficiency requirements of non-staple food production in various urban people's communes, a comprehensive plan and unified arrangement were carried out throughout the city, starting from the perspective of being conducive to the overall development of production. Various urban people's communes and branches have designated certain non-staple food production bases. In addition to the six branches that specialize in vegetable production, other general branches also have vegetable brigades and vegetable production teams according to specific conditions to ensure the supply of vegetables. Specific arrangements have also been made for places where livestock and poultry are raised. Various urban people's communes and organs, factories, and schools in the city have established more than 800 large, medium, and small pig farms in the suburbs. In addition to the fact that the fish farming in Chaohu Lake, Shushan Lake, and Yongqing Lake belongs to the entire city, the remaining thirty-seven small ponds and dams, with a total area of more than 2,600 mu, have been allocated to various communes, branches, and brigades as bases for developing fish farming. Third, carry out extensive publicity and mobilization, mobilize the masses, start together, and vigorously engage in non-staple food production. For example, in mid-June, various communes in the city mobilized more than 112,000 person-times to seize the opportunity after the rain to rush-plant soybeans and other crops, making full use of the sides of roads, edges of ponds, and unused vacant land requisitioned by some organs, and rush-planted more than 7,000 mu of soybeans in one week. Fourth, vigorously carry out collaboration, mutual support, mutual exchange of information, and mutual promotion. Under the unified organizational leadership of various communes, urban branches and professional vegetable branches carried out extensive collaboration. Vegetable branches actively supported urban branches with poultry, hatching eggs, piglets, and sows; urban branches also vigorously supported vegetable branches with labor and production tools. For example, the Dongfanghong branch of the Dongshi People's Commune, which mainly produces vegetables, recently supported other seven urban branches in the commune with 3,500 chicks and 1,400 ducklings, and the commune's livestock farm distributed 28 sows to the seven urban branches to help them prepare for the construction of breeding farms. In late June, after heavy rains, many vegetable fields in the Dongfanghong branch were flooded. At this time, the Dongshi Commune immediately organized fifteen motors, dispatched more than fifty electricians, and more than 300 employees to help them drain water. The accumulated water on the vegetable fields was quickly drained, and vegetable production did not suffer any losses. Fifth, establish systems and strengthen the management responsibility system for non-staple food production. Based on the characteristics of vegetable production being technically demanding and having a large workload, in order to achieve greater large-area high yields, the "five fixings" (fixed cadre leadership, fixed land, fixed labor, fixed fertilizer, fixed production tools) and "six guarantees" (guarantee of work, guarantee of output, guarantee of quality, guarantee of cost, guarantee of variety, guarantee of time) were generally implemented in professional vegetable production branches, brigades, and production teams. In terms of collective breeding of livestock and poultry, specific personnel were also assigned to be responsible for strengthening breeding management and improving management technology.

At present, in order to further develop non-staple food production, various urban people's communes in the city are continuing to exert their efforts on the basis of existing achievements, vigorously engaging in the breeding and raising of livestock and poultry, the arrangement of vegetable cropping, processing and storage, and the organization of balanced market supply.

　　合肥城市公社大力增产副食品
　　全市生猪、鱼类和蔬菜生产迅速上升，有的单位已做到自给有余
    本报讯　安徽省合肥市在建立城市人民公社的过程中，充分发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，在大抓工业生产的同时，还大力发展副食品生产。几个月来，副食品生产已有了很大的发展。目前全市商品蔬菜播种面积已达七万八千多亩，比1959年提高50％。每天蔬菜上市量达五十四万多斤，比建立城市人民公社以前增加54％，品种达到四百八十多种。今年上半年以来全市饲养生猪十二万九千多头，现在生猪存栏数仍有九万二千多头，家禽七十八万多只；养鱼四千二百多万尾。已有五十多个单位实现了肉食自给，有的单位还自给有余。住在南市人民公社的有些机关如中共安徽省委办公厅、省直幼儿园、市公私合营砖瓦商店和西市区人民法院等四个单位，今年1至5月份共养猪一千八百多头。
    上述成绩的取得，是合肥市各个城市人民公社认真贯彻了“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，加强对副食品生产的领导，大搞群众运动，充分调动各方面积极因素的结果。首先是各级党委坚持了政治挂帅，加强了组织领导。市委抽出一个常委专门抓这一工作，还由省市直属机关抽调干部成立了副食品生产办公室。各个公社、分社、工厂、机关、学校一般都由管理生活的书记亲自挂帅，并分别成立了领导机构，大抓以种菜和养猪为中心的副食品生产，各个公社、分社都制定了发展副食品生产的计划，确定了专人负责。从而保证了有组织有领导地开展副食品生产。第二，为了保证实现各个城市人民公社副食品生产自给的要求，从有利于全面发展生产出发，在全市范围内进行了全面规划和统一安排。各个城市人民公社、分社都划有一定的副食品生产基地。全市除了有六个分社专业生产蔬菜外，其他一般分社也都根据具体条件设有蔬菜大队和蔬菜生产队，保证蔬菜供给。对饲养家畜家禽的场所，也都作了具体的安排。全市各个城市人民公社和机关、工厂、学校在市郊建立了大、中、小型不等的养猪场有八百多个。除巢湖、蜀山湖、永青湖等养鱼归全市所有外，其余三十七个小塘坝，总面积达二千六百多亩，都分别划给各个公社、分社和大队，作为发展养鱼基地。第三，开展大宣传、大动员、发动群众、一齐动手，大搞副食品生产。如6月中旬，全市各个公社动员了十一万二千多人次，趁雨后突击抢种黄豆等作物，充分利用了道路两旁、塘边田埂以及有些机关征而未用的空闲地，在一周内就抢种了黄豆七千多亩。第四，大搞协作，互相支援、互通有无、相互促进。在各个公社的统一组织领导下，城市分社和专业蔬菜分社开展了大协作。蔬菜分社积极支援城市分社的家禽、种蛋、仔猪、母猪；城市分社也大力支援蔬菜分社的劳动力和生产工具等。如东市人民公社以生产蔬菜为主的东方红分社，最近支援该社内其他七个城市分社的雏鸡即有三千五百只，雏鸭一千四百只，并由公社畜牧场分配给七个城市分社母猪二十八头，帮助他们筹建饲养场。6月下旬，下了大雨后，东方红分社的很多菜地受涝，这时东市公社立即组织了十五部电动机，出动电工五十余人，职工三百多人，帮助他们抽水，菜地上的积水很快地被排掉了，蔬菜生产没有遭到损失。第五，建立制度，加强副食品生产管理责任制。根据蔬菜生产技术性较强，工作量较大的特点，为了实现更大的大面积丰产，在专业生产蔬菜的分社、大队和生产队内，普遍实行了“五固定”（固定干部领导、固定土地、固定劳力、固定肥料、固定生产工具）和“六包”（包工、包产、包质、包费用、包品种、包时间）的办法。在集体饲养家畜家禽方面，也都确定了专人负责，加强了饲养管理，提高管理技术水平。
    目前，全市各个城市人民公社为了更进一步地发展副食品生产，正在已有成绩的基础上继续鼓足干劲，大搞家畜家禽的繁殖饲养、蔬菜的茬口安排，加工储藏、组织均衡上市等工作。
