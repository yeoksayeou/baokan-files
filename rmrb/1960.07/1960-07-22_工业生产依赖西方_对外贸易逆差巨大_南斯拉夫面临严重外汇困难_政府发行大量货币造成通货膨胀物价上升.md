Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 21st dispatch: According to Yugoslav newspapers, Yugoslavia is facing acute foreign exchange difficulties, and the foreign trade deficit is rising sharply.

According to the "Komunist" weekly of June 16, Yugoslavia's foreign trade deficit in the first five months of this year reached 46.5 billion dinars, an increase of 19.4 billion, or 66%, compared with the same period last year. The newspaper stated that the total export volume in the first five months was 62.2 billion dinars, an increase of 16% compared with the same period last year, but the total import volume reached 108.7 billion, an increase of 33% compared with the same period last year. Yugoslav newspapers stated that according to the original regulations, exports in 1960 should increase by 23% compared with 1959, and imports should only increase by 12%.

The "Economic Policy" weekly of June 11 stated that the export value in May was 12.5 billion dinars, a decrease of 13% compared with April and a decrease of 9% compared with the same month last year. Under these circumstances, Yugoslavia was forced to reduce imports. The total import value in May was 21 billion dinars, a decrease of 1 billion compared with April. However, the "Economic Review" of June 27 pointed out: "Restricting the import of reprocessed materials will negatively affect mines, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, electrical machinery, chemical, textile, and leather shoe industries" because their production "largely depends on the supply of reprocessed materials and raw materials."

An important characteristic of industrial production in Yugoslavia is that it relies on importing reprocessed materials from Western countries to maintain production. Yugoslav industrial enterprises rarely produce reprocessed materials themselves. Many factories have virtually become affiliated assembly workshops of Western enterprises.

According to the "Komunist" weekly of June 23, in the first four months of this year, the import of reprocessed materials increased by 50% compared with the same period last year. The "Borba" newspaper reported on May 24 that in the first four months of this year, the production of the electrical machinery industry, which is said to have the fastest development speed, "mostly" relied on increasing imports of reprocessed materials and parts. The newspaper also stated that "this situation also applies to other departments."

Some Yugoslav industrial enterprises rely on purchasing licenses and patents from Western European countries for production. According to "Liberation Daily," from a technical point of view, Yugoslav products are "ten years behind" Western European "advanced countries" and are therefore not competitors with Western Europe. Yugoslavia mainly exports agricultural products to Western Europe as an agricultural country, but in the past two years, the establishment of the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area" has made the export of Yugoslav agricultural products a problem. Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Todorović said, "The export of agricultural products is seriously lagging behind."

Faced with numerous economic difficulties, the Yugoslav government has attempted to solve them by issuing large amounts of currency. By the end of April this year, the National Bank of Yugoslavia had issued approximately 90 billion dinars in short-term and long-term working capital loans. The "Politika" newspaper of May 27 stated that the working capital loans issued by the National Bank in the first quarter of this year increased by 34.4 billion dinars compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and 36.1 billion more than the first quarter of last year. The newspaper stated that the vast majority of these loans were not used to expand production, but for "existing production, import allocations, and finished product reserves." The "Labor Daily" of June 4 described the situation of financial difficulties, saying, "The turnover rate of funds is unacceptably low. Loans cannot be repaid on time." "And enterprises... put pressure on banks to get new loans," "repayment cannot fill the large treasury of loan issuance, then new loans can only be provided by issuing banknotes."

The "Economic Review" of May 26 described this as "caused by the unplanned use of funds." The newspaper lamented, "All of this is directly reflected in the market: rising prices, inflation, and leading to a reduction in the already achieved living standards, as well as hindering planned growth."

Regarding the decline in living standards, the "Economic Policy" weekly of April 16 stated that the cost of living in the first three months of this year increased by 7% compared with the same period last year, and 9% higher than the average last year. The "Economic Policy" weekly of June 11 stated that the cost of living in May increased by another 4% compared with April. The "Komunist" weekly of June 9 stated that "the cost of living for a working-class family of four increased by an average of 12% by the end of May this year compared with last year, while the cost of living for staff families increased by 13%." According to official materials, the number of unemployed in the first three months of this year remained at around 200,000.

### 工业生产依赖西方　对外贸易逆差巨大  南斯拉夫面临严重外汇困难  政府发行大量货币造成通货膨胀物价上升

    工业生产依赖西方　对外贸易逆差巨大
    南斯拉夫面临严重外汇困难
    政府发行大量货币造成通货膨胀物价上升
    新华社21日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：据南斯拉夫的报刊报道，南斯拉夫正面临着尖锐的外汇困难，外贸赤字急剧上升。
    据6月16日的“共产主义者”周报透露，今年头五个月，南斯拉夫的外贸赤字达四百六十五亿第纳尔，比去年同期多一百九十四亿，即增加66％。这家报纸说，头五个月的出口总额为六百二十二亿第纳尔，虽比去年同期增加16％，但进口总额却达一千零八十七亿，即比去年同期增加33％。南斯拉夫报纸说，按原先的规定，1960年的出口应比1959年增长23％，进口只应增加12％。
    6月11日的“经济政策”周报说，5月份的出口额为一百二十五亿第纳尔，比4月份减少13％，比去年同一个月下降9％，在这种情况下，南斯拉夫被迫削减进口。5月份的进口总额为二百一十亿第纳尔，比4月份减少十亿。但是6月27日的“经济评论报”指出：“限制进口再加工材料，会消极地影响矿井、黑色和有色冶金、电机、化学、纺织和皮革皮鞋工业”。因为它们的生产，“在很大程度上取决于再加工材料和原料的供应”。
    南斯拉夫工业生产中的一个重要特点是：靠从西方国家进口再加工材料来维持生产。南斯拉夫工业企业自己很少生产再加工材料。很多工厂实际上形成了西方企业的附属装配车间。
    据6月23日的“共产主义者”周报透露，今年头四个月，再加工材料的进口比去年同期增加了50％。5月24日的“战斗报”报道，在今年头四个月，所谓发展速度最快的电机工业，“大部分”产品的生产是依靠增加进口再加工材料和零件。这家报纸并且说，“这一情况也适用于其他部门”。
    南斯拉夫一些工业企业是靠购买西欧国家的许可证和专利权进行生产的。据“解放报”说，从技术上讲，南斯拉夫的产品比西欧“先进国家”“落后十年”，因此不是西欧的竞争对手。南斯拉夫主要是作为一个农业国家向西欧输出农产品，但近两年来，由于“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的建立，使南斯拉夫的农产品输出成了问题。南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席托多罗维奇说，“农产品的出口有较严重的落后”。
    面临经济上的重重困难，南斯拉夫政府曾企图用大量发行货币来加以解决。到今年4月底为止，南斯拉夫国家银行发放了约九百亿第纳尔的长短期流动资金贷款。5月27日的“政治报”说，国家银行在今年第一季度发放的流动资金贷款，比去年第四季度增加了三百四十四亿第纳尔，比去年第一季度多发放了三百六十一亿。这家报纸说，这些贷款的绝大部分不是用来扩大生产，而是用于“现有生产，进口拨款和成品储备”。6月4日的“劳动报”在描述资金困难的情形时说，“资金周转率小到不可容许的程度。贷款不能按时偿还”。“而企业……向银行施加压力，要新的贷款”，“偿还却填不满发放贷款的大钱柜，那么新的贷款，只能由发行纸币来提供”。
    5月26日的“经济评论报”把这说成是“因无计划地使用资金而造成的”。这家报纸悲叹地指出，“这一切都直接反映到市场上：物价上涨，出现通货膨胀和导致降低已经达到的生活水平，以及妨碍有计划的增长”。
    关于生活水平降低的情况，4月16日的“经济政策”周报说，今年头三个月的生活费用比去年同期上涨了7％，比去年平均上涨9％。6月11日的“经济政策”周报说，5月份的生活费用比4月份又上涨了4％。6月9日的“共产主义者”周报说，“四口人的工人家庭的生活费用，到今年5月底比去年平均增长了12％，而职员家庭的生活费用增长了13％”。据官方材料，今年头三个月的失业人数仍保持在二十万人左右。
