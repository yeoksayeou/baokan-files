Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th: The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), among others, have issued statements strongly protesting the Supreme Court's ruling in support of the unconstitutional, fascist-repressive law known as the "Public Safety Ordinance."

The Japanese Communist Party's statement pointed out that the Supreme Court's ruling tramples on the people's right to freedom of expression. The statement accuses the ruling of being intended to suppress the people's powerful actions.

The Socialist Party's statement said that the Supreme Court's ruling is an attempt to suppress the people's movement for political purposes. Although the Constitution clearly guarantees the freedom to hold assemblies and demonstrations, the Supreme Court is attempting to deprive the people of this freedom.

The statement said, "We will guarantee the struggle for the people's political freedom and continue the movement to abolish the unconstitutional Public Safety Ordinance."

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's statement said, "Sohyo" will intensify mass action and launch a movement to abolish the "Public Safety Ordinance." The statement emphasized, "We must never tolerate the Public Safety Ordinance being used as a weapon against the people's movement."

The National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution issued a statement pointing out that the Supreme Court's ruling is fraught with danger because this decision considers the people's mass actions generally "criminal" in nature. The statement said that the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution cannot accept the Supreme Court's ruling because it violently trampled on the constitutional right to hold assemblies and public demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today protesting the police's intrusion into the offices of the Japanese Communist Party's Tokyo and Kanagawa local organizations, and protesting the police's arrest of Hiroshi Hasegawa and three other Communist Party members on charges of participating in the June 10th demonstration against U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty. The statement was issued by the JCP at a press conference held in Tokyo.

This morning, Japanese police authorities illegally searched the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee, the Kanagawa Prefectural Committee, the Yokohama City Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and the residences of Hiroshi Hasegawa, head of the Japanese Communist Party's Youth Countermeasures Department, and Isao Nakanishi, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party's Kanagawa Prefectural Committee, and arrested four party members, including Hiroshi Hasegawa.

The Japanese Communist Party's statement condemned the intrusion and arrests as illegal and unjust.

The statement emphasized: "It is no mere coincidence that this unjust suppression of our party is taking place on the same day that the Supreme Court made a ruling supporting the unconstitutional Public Safety Ordinance."

The statement pointed out: Suppressing the Communist Party is an important part of the scheme of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries directed against the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the "Security Treaty."

The statement said: "The Japanese Communist Party firmly protests the suppressive measures taken against our party. We demand the immediate release of the arrested comrades and all workers and students arrested on equally trumped-up charges."

    强烈抗议法西斯“公安条例”
    日共抗议警察非法逮捕四名日共党员
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党和日本工会总评议会等纷纷发表声明，强烈抗议最高裁判所作出判决支持违反宪法的法西斯镇压法律“公安条例”。
    日本共产党的声明指出，最高裁判所的判决践踏了规定的人民自由发表意见的权利。声明指责这种裁决是为了镇压人民的有力行动。
    社会党的声明说，最高裁判所的判决是为了政治目的而企图镇压人民的运动。虽然宪法明明白白地保障举行集会和示威的自由，但是最高裁判所企图剥夺人民的这个自由。
    声明说，“我们将保证为争取人民的政治自由而斗争，继续展开废除不符合宪法的公安条例的运动。”
    日本工会总评议会的声明说，“总评”将加紧展开群众行动，展开废除“公安条例”的运动。声明强调说，“我们决不能容忍公安条例被用来作为反对人民运动的武器。”
    日本拥护宪法国民联合会发表声明指出，最高裁判所的判决充满着危险，因为这个决定认为，人民的群众行动一般在本质上都是“犯罪”的。声明说，拥护宪法国民联合会决不能接受最高裁判所的判决，因为它狂暴地践踏了宪法规定的举行集会和公开示威的权利。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天发表声明，抗议警察侵入日本共产党的东京和神奈川地方组织的办事处，并且抗议警察以参加6月10日反对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的示威为罪名逮捕长谷川浩和其他三名共产党员。这个声明是日共在东京举行的记者招待会上发表的。
    日本警察当局今天上午侵入日本共产党东京都委员会、神奈川县委员会、横滨市委员会和日本共产党青年对策部部长长谷川浩、日本共产党神奈川县委员会委员长中西功的住宅等处，进行非法搜查，并逮捕了长谷川浩等四名党员。
    日本共产党的声明谴责这种侵入和逮捕是非法的和不正当的。
    声明强调说：“在最高裁判所作出裁决、支持违反宪法的公安条例的同一天，对我党进行这种不正当的镇压，这并不只是一种巧合。”
    声明指出：镇压共产党是美日反动派针对日本人民反对“安全条约”的爱国正义斗争的阴谋的一个重要部分。
    声明说：“日本共产党坚决抗议对我党采取的镇压措施。我们要求立即释放被捕的同志和以同样莫须有的罪名被逮捕的所有的工人和学生。”
