Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 2nd – According to the Indian Press Trust on July 1st, the US Development Loan Fund announced that it recently signed seven loan agreements simultaneously with Indian enterprises, totaling $89.2 million (422 million rupees).

　　Of the loans provided by these seven agreements, five are for power generation facilities, one is for a bank, and one is for the private Indian import of US-made Jeep and truck parts.

　　The "Eastern Economist" weekly, owned by the Indian monopoly capital Birla Group, in an editorial on June 24th commenting on the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, expressed the hope that the US would increase its investment in India as a result.

　　The editorial said that American public opinion has been "shocked" by events in Japan, Korea, and Turkey.

　　The editorial wrote, "If trade follows foreign policy, just as trade followed the flag in the colonial era, one might expect Indo-US trade to increase greatly in the near future." The editorial unrealistically hopes that some of this will be diverted from Japan. It believes that "some American enterprises scheduled to open in Japan this year will inevitably be transferred to India."

　　The editorial proclaimed, "It would be wise for India and the United States to seriously consider what has happened and prepare themselves for the new partnership that is already in sight."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th – Washington News: US Under Secretary of State Dillon testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday regarding the income tax treaty signed between the US and India, expressing satisfaction with India's efforts to encourage foreign investment.

　　Dillon said that India has done its best to improve the "atmosphere" conducive to foreign capital investment in India.

　　Dillon urged the Foreign Relations Committee to approve the treaty signed between the US and India. He said that the treaty "will contribute to a sound economic partnership between our two countries." He emphasized that concluding this treaty is "one of the ways in which the US government hopes to support the Indian government's efforts to attract more private capital."

　　According to the Indian National Congress Party's national committee publication, "Economic Review," not long ago, quoting Indian monopoly capitalist Birla, the Indian government is now taking measures to gradually reduce income tax for new enterprises and increase depreciation allowances in order to encourage foreign investment, stipulating that new enterprises are exempt from taxes for the first five years, and foreign technical personnel in India are also exempt from income tax for the first three years.

　　Dillon also advocated that the United States should step up its capital exports to underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa. He said that the United States' current private investment in Asia and Africa accounts for only 13% of all US private overseas investment, and he believes this number is "disappointingly low." Dillon stated that the US will take measures to stimulate a large flow of private capital to these regions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st – London News: British Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations, Cuthbert Alport, announced in Parliament yesterday that Britain will provide India with a new loan of 10 million pounds to pay for India's import bills from Britain.

　　Alport said that India had requested early assistance to meet its foreign exchange needs for 1960-61.

　　According to Reuters, in addition to the above loan to India, Britain will also consider India's need for "aid" this year together with the loan groups of the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan.

    美国资本大量输入印度
    狄龙夸奖印度对外国私人资本洞开门户的作法
    新华社新德里2日电　据印度报业托辣斯1日消息，美国开发贷款基金会宣布，最近它同印度各企业同时签订了数额共达八千九百二十万美元（合四亿二千二百万卢比）的七个贷款协定。
    这七个协定提供的贷款有五笔用于发电设施，一笔给予银行，一笔用于供印度私营进口美制吉普车和卡车零件。
    印度垄断资本比拉集团的“东方经济学家”周刊6月24日在评论日本人民的反美爱国斗争的社论中，希望美国由此将增加在印度的投资。
    社论说，美国的舆论已经被在日本、朝鲜以及土耳其发生的事件所“震动”。
    社论写道，“如果说贸易是跟着外交政策走的话，正像在殖民时代贸易跟着国旗走那样，人们可能盼望印美贸易在最近将来会有很大的增加。”社论一厢情愿地希望，其中一部分将从日本转过来。它认为，“预定今年在日本开办的一些美国企业必将被转移到印度”。
    社论鼓吹说，“印度和美国认真考虑已发生的事情，使自己对已经在望的新合伙关系作好准备，那将是明智的。”
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副国务卿狄龙昨天在参议院外交委员会为美国同印度签订的所得税条约作证，对印度鼓励外国投资的作法表示满意。
    狄龙说，印度已经尽了它最大的努力来改善有利于外国资本在印度投资的“气氛”。
    狄龙要求外交委员会批准美国同印度签订的这项条约。他说，这项条约“将对我们两国之间健全的经济伙伴关系作出贡献”。他强调，缔结这项条约是美国政府“希望用来支持印度政府为吸引更多的私人资本所作的努力的方法之一”。
    据印度国大党全国委员会机关刊物“经济评论”不久以前援引印度垄断资本家比拉的话说，印度政府为了鼓励外国投资，现在正在采取措施逐步减少新企业的所得税和提高折旧津贴，规定新企业在头五年内可以免缴赋税，外国在印度的技术人员在头三年内也可以免缴所得税。
    狄龙同时还鼓吹美国应该加紧对亚非地区不发达国家的资本输出。他说，美国现在在亚洲和非洲的私人投资只占美国全部私人海外投资的13％，他认为这个数字是“令人失望地低”的。狄龙表示，美国将要采取措施来刺激私人资本大量流向这些地区。
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国协办联邦关系事务国务大臣卡思伯特·奥耳波特昨天在议会宣布，英国提供印度一千万英镑的新贷款，以便支付印度从英国的入口货款。
    奥耳波特说，印度曾经要求及早向它提供援助，以应付1960—61年的外汇需要。
    据路透社报道，除给印度上述贷款外，英国以后还要同美国、加拿大、西德和日本的贷款团一起考虑印度今年对“援助”的需要问题。
