Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: The "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper today published an editorial commemorating the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. The editorial emphasized that celebrating this memorable founding day – July 15th – is of particular importance at a time when the Japanese people's movement for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality is rising.

The editorial pointed out that the past thirty-eight years have been a history of suffering for the Japanese people, but also a history of political tempering. The editorial said that based on the experience gained from these years of painful history, the Japanese people are now engaged in a struggle against American imperialism and the Japanese traitorous reactionaries, and for peace, independence, and democracy.

The editorial emphasized that in these struggles, the Japanese Communist Party has consistently held high the banner of revolution, encouraged the people to fight against powerful enemies, guided the people to strive for liberation, and played its role. Our party's revolutionary tradition, its adherence to Marxism-Leninism, and its spirit of self-sacrifice in serving the people's struggle are the main pillars of the Japanese people's current struggle for liberation.

The editorial pointed out that all Japanese democratic forces now face two paths – whether to keep the achievements of the struggle against the "Security Treaty" in the hands of the people, or to allow these achievements to be seized by the reactionaries. The editorial said that the Japanese Communist Party has a duty to stand at the forefront of the current struggle, hold high the banner of patriotism and justice, consolidate the unity of the people, and give the people a correct program of struggle.

The editorial said that the JCP should strengthen its ties with workers, farmers, intellectuals, small business owners, youth, and students, and rapidly increase the number of party members.

The editorial concluded that strengthening the struggle to ensure the victory of the Japanese people and building a strong Communist Party is the sacred responsibility of all JCP members.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party announced on the 13th the second list of JCP nominees to participate in the upcoming general election.

The list announced this time includes twelve people, including Shizo Suzuki, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the JCP.

The first list of JCP candidates for the general election (ninety-four names) was published on June 6th.

The JCP will soon publish the third list of candidates for the general election.

　　“赤旗报”发表社论纪念建党节日
　　日本共产党高举爱国旗帜前进
　　日共公布参加大选的第二批候选人名单
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，纪念日本共产党成立三十八周年。社论强调说，在日本人民争取和平、独立、民主和中立运动日益高涨的时候，庆祝这个值得纪念的建党的日子——7月15日，有着特别的重要意义。
    社论指出，过去三十八年的历史是使日本人民痛苦的历史，同时也是日本人民在政治上受到锻炼的历史。社论说，日本人民根据他们在这些年的痛苦历史中所获得的经验，现在正在从事反对美帝国主义和日本卖国反动派以及争取和平、独立和民主的斗争。
    社论强调说，在这些斗争中，日本共产党始终高举革命的旗帜，鼓舞人民同强大的敌人进行斗争，指导人民争取解放，发挥着自己的作用。我们党的革命传统、它所维护的马克思列宁主义以及为人民斗争尽力的自我牺牲精神，是当前日本人民争取解放斗争的主要支柱。
    社论指出，所有的日本民主力量现在都面临着两条道路——是把反对“安全条约”的斗争的成就保持在人民手中呢，还是让这些成就被反动派所剥夺。社论说，日本共产党有义务站在目前斗争的最前列，高举爱国主义和正义的旗帜，巩固人民的团结和给人民以正确的斗争纲领。
  社论说，日共应该加强同工人、农民、知识分子、小企业者、青年和学生的联系，迅速增加党员人数。
    社论最后说，加强斗争以保证日本人民的胜利和建设强大的共产党，是所有日共党员的神圣责任。
