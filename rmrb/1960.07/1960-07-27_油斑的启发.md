    Inspiration from an Oil Stain
    Zhang Shujun, a weaver at the Beijing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, used to think, like some other weavers, that it was impossible for a weaver not to produce substandard cloth. He once said, "If you don't want to produce substandard cloth, don't weave cloth."
    Once, he wanted to make a jacket and saw a piece of light gray khaki in a department store. The color was beautiful and elegant. But when the salesperson took the cloth down, he noticed an oil stain on the edge of the cloth. He felt quite frustrated: if he bought it, the beautiful cloth would have an oil stain; if he didn't buy it, he really liked the cloth. In the end, he bought it anyway. However, he felt really uncomfortable. At this time, he remembered what the secretary of the Party branch in the workshop said: "The quality of cloth is related to the happiness of the people and the reputation of our state-owned enterprises." He thought, "If someone buys the substandard cloth I weave, wouldn't they feel just as uncomfortable?"
    Just then, Sun Guizhen, an advanced weaver who had not produced substandard cloth for four years and two months, came to the factory to perform, which greatly inspired him. He thought, "It is not only necessary, but also possible, to not produce substandard cloth. I should be responsible to the people and produce high-quality cloth to meet the needs of the people." So he made up his mind to study hard and practice diligently to improve quality.
    In the fourteen months since then, he has not only overfulfilled the production plan every month, but also all of the more than 25,000 meters of plaid cloth he has woven have been first-class products. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    油斑的启发
    北京机织印染厂的织布工张书俊，过去也跟有的织布工人一样，认为织布工不出次布是不可能的。他曾经说：“若要不出次布，除非不织布。”
    有一次，他要做一件上衣，在百货公司看中了一块浅灰色的咔叽布，颜色漂亮大方。但等售货员把布拿下来一看，才发现布边上有块油斑。他心里挺懊丧：买吧，挺漂亮的布有块油斑；不买吧，又实在喜爱这块布。最后还是买了。但是，心里实在有点不舒服。这时他想起了车间党支部书记的话：“布的质量好坏关系着人民心情舒畅的问题，也关系着我们国营企业的信誉问题。”他想：“人家要是买了我织的次布，心里不是也同样不舒服吗？”。
    恰好，这时四年零两个月不出次布的先进织布工孙桂珍到厂里表演，使他受到很大启发。他想：“不出次布不仅是必要的，而且是可能的，自己应该对人民负责，生产质量好的布来满足人民需要。”于是他下定决心勤学苦练，搞好质量。
    在到目前为止的十四个月当中，他不仅月月都超额完成了生产计划，而且织出的二万五千多米花格布全部是一级品。　（据新华社讯）
