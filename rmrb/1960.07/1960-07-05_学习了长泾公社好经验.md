In Our Commune

    Learning from the Good Experiences of Changjing Commune
    After reading the "In Our Commune" column in the People's Daily, we found it lively and vibrant, with diverse formats, easy to understand, and full of people, things, and ideas. We were greatly inspired after reading it, which helped us improve our work. After studying the article "Launched a Re-harvesting Campaign of Clearing Fields and Cleaning Heads Along the Roads" from Changjing Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, we organized discussions among all commune cadres. Subsequently, we organized 8,100 elderly and young people to form professional re-harvesting teams. Through gleaning wheat ears, sweeping up wheat grains, re-threshing, processing wheat stalks, and re-winnowing wheat chaff, we recovered over 130,000 jin of wheat from the commune's 39,000 mu of wheat fields. The commune members said, "Reading the newspaper can yield more grain." Whenever the People's Daily arrives, both cadres and members eagerly read the "In Our Commune" column.
    Regarding the "In Our Commune" column, we would also like to offer the following suggestions: First, the coverage in the column should be broadened to allow us to promptly understand the new developments in construction across the country, exchange experiences, and improve the management of the people's commune. Second, more experiences in running the commune and management should be introduced to help us improve our leadership skills. Third, planned Q&A sessions and discussions should be organized to clarify the Party's policies and exchange experiences. Fourth, more model figures in various fields should be commended.
      (Editor's Note: These suggestions are very good. We will definitely improve and enrich this column in terms of content and form according to the readers' demands. We hope that the commune cadres and members will pay attention to this column and regularly contribute articles.)

专栏：在我们公社里

    学习了长泾公社好经验
    我们看了人民日报“在我们公社里”的专栏，感到生动活泼，体裁多样，通俗易懂，见人见物见思想，读了以后，很受启发，帮助我们改进了工作。我们学习了江苏省江阴县长泾公社“开展了路上清场头清的复收运动”一稿，组织全社干部进行了讨论，随即组织了八千一百名老年少年，组成复收专业队，经过拾麦穗、扫麦粒、复轧、麦秸过葆、复扬麦糠，全社三万九千亩麦田，多收回了十三万多斤麦子。社员们说：“读报能多出粮食。”每逢来了人民日报，无论是干部社员，都争着看“在我们公社里”专栏。
    对“在我们公社里”这个专栏，我们还想提出以下几点意见：第一，栏内报道面再广泛些，使我们及时了解祖国各地建设新面貌，互相交流经验，把人民公社办得更好。第二，多介绍一些办社和经营管理的经验，帮助我们提高领导水平。第三，有计划的搞些问答、讨论，明确党的政策，互相交流经验。第四，多表扬各方面的模范人物。
      （编者按：这些意见很好。我们一定根据读者的要求从内容上和形式上不断提高和丰富这个专栏。希望公社干部和社员关心这个专栏，经常为这个专栏写稿。）
