Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: Some schools and factories in Beijing held rallies on the 18th to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique.

　　Those holding rallies that day included Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Medical College, Beijing Railway Institute, the Institute of International Relations, Beijing Glass Factory, Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company, and other units. Vietnamese students and interns in these units also participated in the rallies.

　　Wang Jiajun, chairman of the Peking University Student Union, spoke on behalf of the students of the entire university, saying that the Vietnamese people are by no means isolated; they have the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, as well as all peace-loving people of the world, as a strong backing. Vietnamese student representative Nguyen Anh Thai then spoke. After listing the criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam, he said that the Vietnamese people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country has received the support of socialist countries and peace-loving people in various countries around the world. The Vietnamese people will carry out the struggle with even greater confidence until final victory is achieved.

　　At the rally held at the Beijing Railway Institute, Student Union Vice Chairman Shi Yulin said that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its aggression against South Vietnam, and in collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique, is intensifying its implementation of a policy of terror against the people of South Vietnam. This monstrous crime has aroused the boundless anger of all the students in our institute. Vietnamese student representative Huang Qiang said at the meeting that North and South Vietnam are one family, and the Vietnamese people will never allow the U.S.-Ngo clique to continue to run rampant.

　　At the rally held at the Beijing Glass Factory, Ma Jinxi, vice chairman of the factory's trade union, said that U.S. imperialism is constantly shipping new weapons and military personnel to South Vietnam and other parts of Indochina. This criminal activity that violates the Geneva Accords shows that U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. He said that imperialism is, after all, imperialism, and its aggressive nature will never change. We must strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism so that world peace can be guaranteed. Nguyen Van To, head of the Vietnamese intern delegation, said in his speech that under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.

　　北京一些学校工厂集会支持越南人民斗争
    据新华社19日讯　北京的一些学校、工厂企业18日分别举行集会，支持越南人民反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的正义斗争。
    这天举行集会的，有北京大学、清华大学、北京医学院、北京铁道学院、国际关系学院、北京玻璃厂、北京第三建筑工程公司、北京第五建筑工程公司等单位。在这些单位的越南留学生、实习生也都参加了集会。
    北京大学学生会主席王家俊在会上代表全校学生讲话说，越南人民决不是孤立的，他们有以苏联为首的社会主义国家的人民以及全世界一切爱好和平人民作为强大的后盾。越南留学生代表阮英太接着讲话。他在列举美帝国主义在越南南方的罪恶活动后说，越南人民为争取和平统一祖国的正义斗争，已经得到社会主义国家和世界各国爱好和平人民的支持，越南人民将更加信心百倍地进行斗争，一直到取得最后胜利为止。
    在北京铁道学院举行的集会上，学生会副主席时玉林说，美帝国主义加紧对越南南方的侵略，它和吴庭艳卖国集团勾结一起，正在变本加厉地对越南南方人民施行恐怖政策。这种滔天罪行，激起我们全院同学的无比愤怒。越南留学生代表黄强在会上说，越南的北方和南方同是一家，越南人民决不让美吴集团续继横行霸道。
    在北京玻璃厂举行的集会上，这个厂的工会副主席马金喜说，美帝国主义不断向越南南方和印度支那其他地区运入新武器和军事人员，这种破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶活动，说明美帝国主义是越南和平统一的敌人。他说，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，它的侵略本质是永远不会改变的，我们必须加强对美帝国主义的斗争，世界和平才有保障。越南实习生团长阮文素在讲话中说，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
