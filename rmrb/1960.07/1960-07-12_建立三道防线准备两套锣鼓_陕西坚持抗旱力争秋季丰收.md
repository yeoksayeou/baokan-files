Xinhua News Agency report: The rural areas of Shaanxi Province are establishing three lines of defense in the current effort to fight drought during summer planting and to protect autumn crops, preparing two sets of "gongs and drums" to strive for a bumper autumn harvest under drought conditions.

The three lines of defense are: In terms of drought-resistant planting, first, maximize the planting area; second, maximize replanting and intercropping, planting whatever can be planted to fill the land; and third, plant autumn vegetables on all scattered small plots of land. In terms of management, first, focus on "insured fields" (land with sufficient water sources and reliable water conservancy conditions), concentrating manpower, water, and fertilizer on irrigable land to strive for high yields; second, strengthen the management of rain-fed and shady hillside areas to strive for higher yields; and third, promptly weed, preserve soil moisture, and prevent pests in general fields to strive for no reduction in yield. The two sets of "gongs and drums" refer to preparing two sets of seeds for short-season crops, replanting if the seeds don't sprout; and paying attention to preventing waterlogging while fighting drought, etc.

These three lines of defense and two sets of "gongs and drums" are important measures taken by Shaanxi Province, based on the experience of fighting drought over the past two years, to actively and reliably ensure victory over drought. Last autumn, Shaanxi suffered an unprecedented hundred-day drought, but thanks to the efforts of the masses under the slogan of "supplementing dry land losses with irrigated land, supplementing grain losses with autumn vegetables, and supplementing agricultural losses with sideline occupations," the province still increased grain production for the year. Irrigated areas and the relatively rainy areas of northern Shaanxi and the Shangluo Special District, through strengthened autumn field management and vigorous campaigns for higher yields, achieved substantial increases in production. Last year, Lueyang County in the Hanzhong Special District, benefiting from several rains, focused on both planting area and yield per unit area, resulting in an increase of more than 40% in the county's total grain output compared to the previous year. Sanyuan County in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area concentrated its superior forces on irrigated land, resulting in an average increase of 20% in cotton yield per mu compared to the previous year for the county's cotton, which accounts for 15% of the province's total cotton area, playing a significant role in ensuring the province's cotton output. Last autumn, the province increased the planting of 3.2 million mu of autumn vegetables on scattered plots of land and intercropped them with other crops, resulting in a large harvest. In summarizing these experiences, all parts of the province have realized that as long as they start from the worst natural conditions and anticipate changes in natural conditions, making full preparations in terms of both spirit and materials, they can overcome drought.

With past experience summarized, improved, and transformed into powerful drought-fighting measures, the confidence of cadres and the masses throughout the province in overcoming drought has greatly increased. Currently, 60,000 cadres at all levels are working deep on the front lines, leading more than 3 million drought-fighting troops in battling the drought. In order to maximize the planting area, all parts of the province have launched a high tide of rushing to plant and replant, and checking and supplementing seedlings. Lintong County has exceeded its summer planting plan by 30.2% by using various methods such as planting drought-resistant crops in paddy fields and shady slopes. Commune members in areas such as Hanzhong City and Shang County are intercropping cabbage in cotton fields, radishes in cornfields, black beans on rice paddy ridges, castor beans in sorghum fields, and corn in autumn sweet potato fields. Wuxiang Commune in Hanzhong City alone has intercropped more than 6,100 mu. Zhen'an County has also made extensive use of "ten-edge" scattered land along roadsides, canal sides, dikes, and pond sides to grow vegetables, and now each household has planted an average of seven or eight fen, greatly exceeding the county party committee's requirement of increasing vegetable planting by one fen per person.

In terms of management, all parts of the province are vigorously developing "insured fields." Yeshan People's Commune in Dali County, located in the arid plains, has 64,000 mu of late autumn crops, of which 42,000 mu are "insured fields." Commune members have launched the "one bucket of water per corn seedling" campaign, watering more than 13,000 mu of corn on June 24 alone, while also applying 6,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. The three special districts of Hanzhong, Ankang, and Shangluo, which have relatively more rainfall, are stepping up water storage and further strengthening field management to strive for higher yields. Management of drought-stricken autumn fields and small plots of land has not been relaxed in all areas. Qiuping Commune in Pingli County has widely launched the "three excesses and eight catches" campaign, which includes exceeding the yields of "insured fields" with high-yield fields and transforming slope land into plains.

Recently, rain fell in northern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee immediately held a telephone conference, calling for a rapid upsurge in the rush to plant and manage, concentrating efforts to plant enough and manage well. Chang'an County mobilized 110,000 people, and in one day rushed to plant more than 66,000 mu of late autumn crops and autumn vegetables.

    建立三道防线准备两套锣鼓
　　陕西坚持抗旱力争秋季丰收
    据新华社讯　陕西省农村在当前抗旱夏种和抗旱保秋中建立起三道防线，准备下两套锣鼓，在干旱条件下力争秋季丰收。
    这三道防线，在抗旱播种方面，一是尽量扩大播种面积；二是尽量补种、套种，能种什么就种什么，把地种满；三是在所有零星小块土地上大种秋菜。在管理方面，一是抓保险田
  （水源充足、水利条件有可靠保证的地），凡能灌溉的田地，就集中人力和水、肥，加强管理，力争高产；二是加强对偏雨和山坡背阴地的管理，力争超产；三是对一般大田及时锄草、保墒、防虫，争取不减产。两套锣鼓是：小日月庄稼（即成熟期短的农作物）的种子准备两套，种下不出苗，再种；在抗旱的同时注意防涝，等等。
    这三道防线和两套锣鼓，是陕西省总结两年来抗旱经验而采取的积极可靠的保证战胜干旱的重要措施。去年秋季陕西遭受数十年未有的百日大旱，但是全省在“旱地丢了水地补，粮食丢了秋菜补，农业丢了副业补”的口号下，经过广大群众的努力，全年粮食仍然增了产。灌区和偏雨的陕北和商?专区等地区，经过加强秋田管理，大搞超产运动，结果是大幅度地增了产。汉中专区的略阳县去年在多下几场雨的有利条件下，既抓播种面积，又抓单位产量，最后全县粮食总产量比上年增加四成以上。泾惠渠灌区的三原县，集中优势力量抓水地，结果这个县占全省棉田面积15％的棉花，平均亩产比上年增加了两成，对保证全省棉花产量起了重大作用。去年秋季，全省在零星土地上增种和其他作物中套种了三百二十万亩秋菜，收获也很大。全省各地在总结这些经验中，认识到只要从最坏的自然条件出发，并且估计到自然条件的变化，在精神和物质方面进行充分准备，就可以战胜干旱。
    过去的经验加以总结提高，变为强有力的抗旱措施以后，全省广大干部和群众战胜干旱的信心倍增。目前，全省深入第一线的六万名各级干部，正带领着三百多万抗旱大军，同干旱展开搏斗。为了尽量扩大播种面积，各地都掀起了抗旱抢种、查苗补种的高潮。临潼县用多种水田和阴坡地、改种耐旱作物等办法，已超额30.2％完成了夏播计划。汉中市和商县等地区的人民公社社员，正在棉田里套种白菜，在玉米地里套种萝卜，在稻田埂上套种黑豆，在高粱地里套种桐麻，在秋薯地里套种玉米等。仅汉中市武乡公社就套种了六千一百多亩。?南县还利用路边、渠边、堤边、塘边等“十边”零星土地大种蔬菜，到现在平均每户已经种到七、八分，大大超过了县委提出的每人增种一分蔬菜的要求。
    在管理方面，各地都在大搞保险田。地处旱原的大荔县业善人民公社，共有六万四千亩晚秋作物，其中保险田就有四万二千亩。全社社员展开了“一窝玉米一桶水”运动，6月24日一天就担水点浇一万三千多亩玉米，每亩还施肥六千斤。偏雨地区的汉中、安康、商?三个专区，都抓紧蓄水，并且进一步加强田间管理，力争超产。各地对于受旱秋田和小块地的管理也没有放松。平利县秋坪公社广泛开展了丰产（田）超保险（田）、坡地赶平川等“三超八赶”运动。
    最近，陕北、关中地区下了雨，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会立即召开电话会议，号召迅速掀起抢种抢管高潮，集中力量种足、管好。长安县出动了十一万人，一天就抢种晚秋作物和秋菜六万六千多亩。
