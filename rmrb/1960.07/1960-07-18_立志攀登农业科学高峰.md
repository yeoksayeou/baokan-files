　　Determined to Scale the Peaks of Agricultural Science
　　Zhang Chaolin, Member of Nanhai Commune, Hanzhong, Shaanxi
    In 1956, after graduating from elementary school, I returned to my hometown. As soon as I entered the door, someone ridiculed me, saying, "A graduate becoming a muddy-legged peasant, what a waste!" Neighbor Aunt Wang also advised me, "Chaolin! You're educated, you should find an easier job. It's hard in the countryside, you won't be able to take it." However, the Party teaches us that young people should love the countryside, use their knowledge in production, and become the first generation of cultured, new-style farmers in the motherland. I thought, our ancestors have been in the countryside for generations, suffering under the landlords before liberation. Now that we've been liberated and gained some knowledge, can we forget our roots? Therefore, I resolved to listen to the Party, determined to work in the countryside for the rest of my life, and build a new socialist countryside with my own hands.
    One day, I happened to see in the newspaper that Sichuan Agricultural College used a cutting method to make one wheat plant grow nine heads. I felt very novel and wanted to try it myself. But after thinking carefully, I thought: No! That's science, how can a primary school graduate do that? At this moment, I remembered the Party calling on us young people to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, to declare war on nature. I am a Communist Party member, how can I not even have this ambition? No! I must experiment boldly! Later, I used the method others used to cut wheat to conduct rice experiments. Practice makes perfect, and the success of this experiment made me understand: science is not mysterious. As long as we listen to the Party, dare to think, and resolutely act, anyone can climb the peaks of science.
    On another occasion, I heard two old farmers chatting idly. One said, "How great it would be if rice could grow like sorghum in dry land, with thick stalks and large ears!" The other said that he had planted a few sorghum plants on the edge of the rice paddy, and he took some seeds from the rice plants near the sorghum and planted them in dry land the following year, and they grew very well without watering. Inspired by them, I felt like I had found a treasure and wanted to experiment immediately. When some people heard that I was going to do "rice and sorghum hybridization," it became the talk of the town. Some people said to me, "Hybridization is a matter for scientists, what's the point of having scientists if a seventeen or eighteen-year-old kid can do it?" Others said, "Plants are born the way they are, unless you're a god, you can't change them." Even the middle school botany teacher said, "You really don't understand science, how can you hybridize different families?" To find the correct answer, I consulted many botany books. But the books also said that "distant hybridization is not easy to maintain good traits." My father scolded me for fooling around, and my mother also advised me to find another way out. At this time, I really felt a little discouraged. However, the Youth League Secretary, Comrade Yang Jiazhen, encouraged me, saying: Practice produces truth, practice produces science, go ahead boldly! At this critical moment, the Party and the League gave me strength and enhanced my confidence, so I went ahead on the road guided by the Party.
    Over the past three years, I have done more than a hundred kinds of experiments. After many twists and turns, under the strong support and education of the Party and the League, I finally presented the facts before the eyes of those with conservative ideas, and made some people who did not believe in science love science. This has made me realize more and more deeply that the process of doing experiments and scientific research is a process of fighting against superstition and conservative thinking; at the same time, I have also come to realize more and more deeply that as long as scientific research implements the principle of serving production as instructed by the Party, as long as we dare to think, dare to act, and study diligently, even if our cultural level is low and we have no experience, we will definitely be able to create great achievements.
    With the support of the Party, I have only made a small achievement, but the Party has given me immense care, sending me to visit Hubei, Henan and other places, and has also allowed me to attend provincial, prefectural, and municipal advanced producers' representative meetings many times, and elected me as a member of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal science and technology associations. In 1958, I also had the honor of attending the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialist Youth. These honors should first of all be attributed to the Party. Over the past few years, I have deeply realized that as long as we resolutely listen to the Party, break down superstition, emancipate our minds, dare to think and dare to act, establish lofty ambitions, and resolutely work hard and stubbornly work, we can open the door to science.

### 立志攀登农业科学高峰

　　立志攀登农业科学高峰
　　陕西汉中南海公社社员　张朝林
    1956年，我从小学毕业后，回到家乡。刚一进门，就有人讥讽我说：“毕业生当黄泥巴腿儿呀，真没出息！”邻居王妈妈也劝我说：“朝林！你有文化，还是找个轻松工作干，在农村苦，你受不了。”但是，党教导说：青年人要热爱农村，要把知识用到生产中去，做祖国第一代有文化的新式农民。我想，咱祖祖辈辈在农村，解放前吃尽了地主的苦头，解放后翻了身，学得了点儿知识，就能忘本吗？于是，决心听党的话，立志在农村干一辈子，亲手建设新农村。
    有一天，从报上偶然看到四川农学院用切割的办法，使一株小麦长出九个头。我就感到很新奇，也想动手试验。可是仔细一想：不行！那是科学，咱这小学毕业生还能办到？这时，我就想起党号召我们青年人敢想敢说敢干，向自然宣战，我是个共产党员，连这么点雄心都没有吗？不！大胆进行试验！后来，我就用别人切割小麦的办法，进行水稻试验。一回生，二回熟，这次试验的成功，使我懂得：科学并不神秘，只要听党的话，大胆想，坚决的干，谁都能攀登上科学高峰。
    又有一次，我听到两位老农闲谈，一个说：“稻子能像高粱一样生长在旱地，秆粗穗大，该多好呀！”另一个就说，他在稻田坎上种过几根高粱，他把靠近高粱的稻子弄了些种子，第二年种在旱地里，不浇水生长得很好。在他们的启发下，我像得了宝贝一样，就想马上进行试验。有人听说我要搞“水稻和高粱杂交”，就满城风雨，有人对我说：“搞杂交是科学家的事，你一个十七、八岁的娃娃能搞杂交，还要科学家干啥？”也有人说：“植物是天生的，你要改变它除非你是神仙。”甚至连中学的植物老师也说：“你真不懂科学，不同科还能杂交吗？”为了找到正确的答案，我翻阅了许多植物书籍。但书本上也说“远缘杂交不易保持优良获得性”父亲骂我胡闹，母亲也劝我找别的出路。这时我真有点灰心了。但是团支书杨家珍同志却鼓励我说：实践出真理，实践出科学，大胆地干吧。正在这个节骨眼上，党、团给了我力量，增强了我的信心，我就朝着党指引的道路干起来。
    三年多来，我做了一百多种试验，经过许多曲折，在党、团的大力支持和教育下，终于用事实摆在思想保守者的眼前，使一些不相信科学的人，热爱了科学。这使我越来越深刻地体会到：搞试验，搞科学研究的过程，就是和迷信保守思想斗争的过程；同时也越来越深刻地体会到，科学研究只要贯彻党所指示的为生产服务的原则，只要敢想敢干，刻苦钻研，就是文化水平低，没有经验，也一定能创造出大的成绩。
    在党的支持下，我只做了微小的一点成绩，但党却给了我莫大的关怀，送我到湖北、河南等地参观，又多次地出席省、专、市先进生产者代表会，并选我为省、专、市科协委员，1958年还光荣地出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。这些荣誉首先应归于党。几年来，我深深体会到，只要坚决听党的话，破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，树立雄心壮志，坚决地干，顽强地干，就能打开科学的大门。
