Our film industry and film art have followed the Party's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, making great progress and development in the past ten years. To date, our country's projection units have developed to more than 15,000, most of which are distributed in the vast countryside; our country's film audience reached 4.15 billion in 1959, with rural audiences accounting for more than half. Our films are a powerful weapon for the Party to conduct socialist and communist education for farmers, and many films have been warmly welcomed by the peasant masses. Films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Dong Cunrui," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "The New Story of an Old Soldier," "Young People in Our Village," "Crossing the Yellow River," "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," and "The Fairy Couple" all have a large number of rural audiences, and the number of rural viewers for many of these films has reached over 100 million. For today's Chinese peasants, film is no longer an unattainable luxury but is increasingly becoming an indispensable part of cultural life.

It should be said that this is a tremendous achievement made by our film work under the leadership of the Party over the past decade. Our films, in terms of ideological content, are rich in the spirit of labor, the spirit of struggle, the spirit of collectivism, and the spirit of progress; our films have begun to create a new style that can timely reflect the face of socialist construction and the spirit of our great era, encouraging the working people to use the spirit of struggle to realize the great ideals of socialism and communism. This gradually formed new style shows that our film workers have embarked on a correct and healthy creative path, and they are closely linked with the masses of the people. It is on this basis that the ideological and artistic quality of the films has been improved, and film quality has achieved a new leap forward. The political enthusiasm of film workers themselves and the political enthusiasm of the people are integrated, demonstrating the striving spirit of the people of our era to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist power at high speed. Therefore, the vast audience affirms and praises our large number of films.

In the short span of ten years, the achievements we have made are undoubtedly enormous, but compared with the requirements of the Party and the needs of the peasant masses, they are still far from adequate. Although the absolute number of film viewers and the number of rural film viewers in our country already ranked first in the world in 1959, this number is still not enough compared to our large agricultural population. We should vigorously develop projection units in rural areas and improve the quality of projection; and more importantly, we must produce a batch of films that are not only highly ideological and artistic but also easy to understand and suitable for the needs of farmers.

The Party has always attached importance to giving full play to film art, a sharp and powerful ideological weapon with a broad mass base, to carry out ideological education work for 500 million peasants. As early as 1953, the State Council's "Decision on Strengthening Film Production Work" clearly pointed out that it is necessary to "produce easy-to-understand rural feature films that are suitable for the needs of farmers to ensure a sufficient number of rural screening programs." According to this instruction, a batch of short story films mainly for rural screening were once produced. However, because our film workers at the time did not fully understand the great significance of shooting such films, and also lacked experience in this area, the effect was not significant enough. At present, shooting films suitable for the needs of farmers has become an important topic facing our film creation. Agriculture is the foundation of our country's national economic development, and 500 million peasants are an important force in our country's socialist construction. The Party calls on all economic and cultural departments to vigorously support agriculture and produce films suitable for the needs of farmers, to educate farmers with socialist and communist ideas, to improve farmers' ideological awareness, and to meet the needs of farmers' cultural life, which is precisely a concrete measure that film departments should take in response to the Party's call to vigorously support agriculture. It should also be seen that producing films suitable for the needs of farmers is by no means just a temporary task, but a long-term task; it is a task related to the further implementation of the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in film art.

To produce easy-to-understand films suitable for the needs of farmers involves a series of issues in creation.

There used to be such an understanding: it seems that easy-to-understand films suitable for the needs of farmers are a kind of simple in form and artistically crude films. This understanding is completely wrong. Being easy to understand does not contradict high ideology and artistry, but is completely unified, especially for film, an art form with a broad mass base. At the same time, according to the materials we have learned, the peasant masses have a fairly high level of appreciation. For example, some of the films listed above that are warmly welcomed by farmers are excellent or relatively good domestic films. When commenting on films, farmers first look at whether the film is "powerful," that is, whether the film has the power to inspire people and has significant educational significance; secondly, they consider whether the film is "dramatic," that is, whether the film has a high degree of artistry. They very simply grasp the standard of criticism put forward by Chairman Mao that politics and art are unified, with politics in the first place. It is precisely according to such standards that they choose the films they like.

Among the films that farmers like, excellent opera films and war-themed films account for a considerable proportion. This phenomenon is completely understandable: opera has a deep mass base and a long history of circulation in rural areas, farmers are accustomed to accepting its performance, most of the dialogues and singing lyrics can be understood, and opera films are generally selected from excellent repertoires that have been tested by the audience in opera, and the actors are mostly famous actors in the opera genre, which is not easy for farmers to see in normal times, so farmers love to watch opera films very much. They say, "Watching opera films is more enjoyable than watching opera." Although these are the reasons why farmers like opera films, more importantly, they also require to be educated and inspired in the same way from opera films. Opera films such as "Commander of a Hundred Years," "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," and "The Fairy Couple" describe the struggle life of ancient people, express the people's resistance to foreign invasion and feudal forces, and reflect the people's will and demands, so they have been welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. It is precisely because our opera films have both correct and healthy ideological content and beautiful forms of expression that they can become one of the most popular styles for farmers.

Similarly, the reason why farmers love to watch combat-themed films is not only because these films have relatively tense plots and strong action, which can attract the audience, but more importantly, it is also because the vast number of farmers in our country have personally experienced a long period of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, are familiar with life in this area, and these films all express the bravery, wit, and optimism of heroic figures in the struggle against the enemy, such as the Shanghai farmers who cited their favorite "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Railway Guerrilla," "Dong Cunrui," "Shangganling," "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," "Nameless Island," and the more popular "Red Boy" among primary and middle school students, etc. These films all praise the revolutionary fighters who carry out selfless struggle for the victory of the revolution and expose the ugliness and shamelessness of the enemy. Farmers say, "Watching such films is really satisfying!" "Watching our navy soldiers in 'Sea Eagle' swear an oath in the sea is really moving. My own energy can't compare to theirs. I should learn from them and produce well." From this, it can be seen that farmers love these films precisely because the struggles reflected in these films are sharp, the love and hate are clear, they can inspire their fighting spirit, and they can become their example for overcoming difficulties and defeating the enemy.

Having a strong combativeness, shaping brilliant heroic images, and adopting easy-to-understand forms of expression that are loved by farmers are the reasons why these films are loved by farmers. Farmers' appreciation tastes are not narrow, on the contrary, their requirements in terms of themes and styles are diverse. Generally speaking, if a film has the above-mentioned characteristics, no matter what the theme and style is, farmers will like it. However, these characteristics are more concentrated in some excellent combat-themed films or opera films.

Some people once believed that farmers only like opera films and war-themed films, and do not like films reflecting rural life, based on one-sided materials. This view is also very wrong. On the contrary, some excellent films depicting rural life are extremely warmly welcomed among farmers. A little further back, such as "The White Haired Girl," farmers never tire of watching it. Whenever it is shown, farmers tell each other. More recently, such as "Young People in Our Village" and "Crossing the Yellow River," farmers also praised them. After "Young People in Our Village" was shown on some reservoir construction sites, a upsurge of "learning from 'Young People in Our Village'" was set off, and "Young People Groups" appeared. Young peasants said, "Watching such films is like opening a youth activist meeting to solve problems." Regarding "Crossing the Yellow River," farmers reflected that watching such films makes people "establish lofty ambitions and great aspirations" and "gives people great encouragement." In addition, farmers also like rural-themed films such as "Liu Jiemei," "Beside the March 8th River," and "Five Golden Flowers." Among rural-themed films, farmers especially want to see films reflecting current rural life. They say, "As long as it is coordinated with the current political movement and related to the rural Great Leap Forward, whether it is a feature film or a documentary, we like to watch it." Hoping to see more feature films reflecting the people's communes is a universal requirement of cadres and farmers in rural areas today.

Such specific and vivid examples show that the view that farmers do not like rural-themed films is unfounded. We do not deny that there were some rural-themed films in the past that farmers were not very interested in. This is because these films did not meet the requirements of farmers in terms of content and form, not because they reflected rural life. Other themed films with similar shortcomings, including some combat-themed films and opera films, are also not popular among farmers. It is precisely because there are still such shortcomings in our work that producing films that farmers love to see has become an important topic in current creation.

Farmers not only love feature films, but also like to watch documentaries, science education films, and animated films. They say, "Documentaries are real people and real events, and can be combined with movements, and sometimes the effect is greater than listening to reports." In newsreels, they especially like shots of central leading comrades in the film. Whenever the beloved leader Chairman Mao appears on the screen, the whole audience boils, applauds, and welcomes, giving everyone great encouragement.

Making farmers able to understand and like to watch puts forward further requirements for the nationalization and massification of our films. Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War": "Foreign stereotypes must be abolished, empty and abstract tunes must be sung less, dogmatism must take a rest, and instead, there must be Chinese style and Chinese spirit that are fresh, lively, and loved by the Chinese people." Chairman Mao's instruction, in the field of literature and art, is the issue of nationalization and massification. Generally speaking, the more nationalized a film is, the more it will be loved by the masses, and therefore the more it will be a mass-based film. Conversely, the more mass-based a film is, the more national characteristics it will have. One of the reasons why our opera films are deeply loved by farmers is that they have a national style that farmers love to see.

The reason why nationalization and massification have become a prominent issue in film art is that film is a foreign art form, and its artistic expression is deeply influenced by foreign countries. In the decade since liberation, our film art has strived to reflect the lives and struggles of the Chinese people, especially the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to reflect the thoughts, feelings, moral concepts, and customs of the Chinese people in the new era, and at the same time, it has made some explorations and efforts in the form of expression, so it has achieved remarkable achievements in terms of nationalization and massification. However, some films still have more or less some "foreignness" that the Chinese people, especially the peasant masses, are not accustomed to. For example, the thoughts, feelings, and styles of the characters are not Chinese enough, the language has foreign accents and intellectual accents, there are many clues, the faces of the characters are not clear, the jumping around in the narrative method, and the stiff flashback shots are all things that farmers do not like to see or do not like to watch. In the process of further nationalization and massification of film art, these shortcomings must be overcome. However, it is not enough to simply eliminate these shortcomings, but also to actively explore and establish a new national style. Since last winter, several major film studios have organized a group of film workers to go to different regions to solicit and collect farmers' opinions on films, many of which are very pertinent and enlightening, and have great reference value for further nationalization and massification of film art.

Farmers love heroic images with distinct personalities in films. In character shaping, they require strong character colors, distinct edges and corners, and do not like characters with blurred faces. At the same time, they also oppose simplifying and caricaturing character personalities.

Farmers like to watch films that have a beginning and an end, clear levels, and clear explanations, that is, they require that the structure of the whole play, the plot, as well as the characters' personalities, identities, and the relationship between the characters, etc., can be clearly explained, and the development of the characters' personalities must have a cause and effect and conform to the logic of life. But at the same time, they also require that the plot of the film be tortuous and the story be strong, and do not like films that "know the back after watching the front." They want to see films with strong dramatic conflicts, and do not like films that are flat and straightforward like reporting "running accounts." They say that watching such films is "disgusting." Farmers are also not very able to accept films with many characters, many clues, and many branches, thinking that such films are "very difficult to watch, like entering a maze."

To sum up these opinions, that is, in order to support agriculture and to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers, our films must have socialist and communist content and nationalized artistic expression forms. Farmers' requirements for film art are completely correct, and film workers should meet their needs. The issue of nationalization and massification is not only a problem that must be solved in creating films needed by farmers, but also a topic facing our entire film art. Farmers not only want to see films reflecting rural life, but also need to see films of various themes, but films reflecting rural life have a more important and urgent task in this regard. Through the filming of films reflecting rural life, our film art will be promoted to further nationalization and massification. The further nationalization and massification of film art can better implement the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more quickly climb the peak of world film art.

It should be seen that to make films that are beneficial to the peasant masses and are loved by them is still not an easy task for today's film art workers. They must make great determination and make great efforts to go deep and become one with the peasant masses. Whether it is the script, directing, or performance, we must strive to be accepted and loved by farmers, that is to say, the production of these films must unswervingly go through the mass line.

At present, all feature film studios are actively carrying out the creation of films suitable for rural screening, and regard this creation as a glorious political task. In order to make the films suitable for the needs of farmers, many creators go to the countryside to solicit farmers' opinions on the films and discuss the scripts with the farmers. This year, all newsreel studios have also newly added rural news magazines and documentaries that are mainly distributed in rural areas. Science and education film studios have already filmed and are filming a batch of science and education films that cooperate with agricultural technology reform. All kinds of films are actively supporting agriculture and striving to better serve the 500 million peasant brothers. We believe that under the strong leadership of the Party and with the efforts of the creators, a batch of films with high ideological and artistic quality that are loved by farmers will soon appear.

    创作农民喜闻乐见的影片更好地为农民服务
    袁文殊
    我们的电影事业和电影艺术遵循了党的为工农兵服务的方向和百花齐放的方针，十年来，有了很大的进步和发展。到目前，我国的放映单位已发展到一万五千多个，其中大部分都分布在广大农村中；我国的电影观众1959年已达到四十一亿五千万人次，其中农村观众人次占一半以上。我们的电影是党对农民进行社会主义、共产主义教育的有力武器，许多影片受到农民群众的热烈欢迎。像《白毛女》、《董存瑞》、《渡江侦察记》、《老兵新传》、《我们村里的年轻人》、《黄河飞渡》、《梁山伯与祝英台》、《天仙配》等，都拥有大量的农村观众，其中许多影片农村观众人次达到一亿以上。对于今天的中国农民来说，电影已经不再是可望而不可即的奢侈品，而是日益成为文化生活中不可缺少的部分了。
    应该说，这是我们的电影工作，在党的领导下，十年来取得的巨大的成绩。我们的影片，在思想内容上，富有劳动的精神、战斗的精神、集体的精神、向上的精神；我们的电影已经开始创造了一种能够及时地反映社会主义建设的面貌，反映我们伟大时代精神的新风格；鼓舞劳动人民用战斗的精神去实现社会主义、共产主义的伟大理想。这种逐步形成的新的风格，显示出我们的电影工作者已经走上了一条正确的健康的创作道路，他们和人民群众心连心地结合起来了。正是在这个基础上，提高了影片的思想性、艺术性，电影质量取得了新的跃进。电影工作者自己的政治热情和人民政治热情融合为一，表现了我们时代的人民群众为高速度地把我国建设成为繁荣富强的社会主义强国的奋发精神。因此广大观众对我们的大批影片是肯定的和赞许的。
    在短短的十年中，我们取得的这些成就无疑地是非常巨大的，但是与党的要求和农民群众的需要比较起来，却还远远不能相适应。虽然我国电影的绝对观众人次和农村观众人次在1959年就已经达到世界的首位，但是比起我国众多的农业人口来，这个数字还是很不够的。我们还应该在农村中大力发展放映单位，提高放映质量；而更重要的是，我们必须制作一批既具有高度的思想性与艺术性，而又是通俗易懂、适合农民需要的影片。
    党历来就重视充分发挥电影艺术这种锋利有力、具有广泛群众性的思想武器，用它来对五亿农民进行思想教育工作的。早在1953年，政务院《关于加强电影制片工作的决定》中，就明确指出，要“制作适应农民需要的通俗易懂的农村故事片，以保证足够数量的农村放映节目。”根据这一指示，曾经拍摄过一批主要供农村放映的短故事片。但是，由于当时我们电影工作者对拍摄这种影片的巨大意义认识不足，同时也缺少这方面的经验，因此成效不够显著。目前，拍摄适合农民需要的影片已成为我们电影创作所面临的一个重要的课题。农业是我国国民经济发展的基础，五亿农民是我国社会主义建设的重要力量。党号召一切经济文化部门大力支援农业，制作适合农民需要的影片，以社会主义、共产主义思想教育农民，提高农民的思想觉悟，满足农民文化生活的要求，正是电影部门响应党的号召、大力支援农业所应作的具体措施。还应该看到：制作适合农民需要的影片决不只是一种临时性的任务，而是长期性的任务；是关系到电影艺术进一步贯彻工农兵方向的任务。
    要制作适合农民需要的通俗易懂的影片，涉及到创作上的一系列的问题。
    曾经有过这样一种理解：似乎通俗易懂适合农民需要的影片，就是一种形式简单、艺术粗糙的影片。这种理解是十分错误的。通俗易懂与高度的思想性艺术性并不矛盾，而且是完全可以统一的，特别是对电影这种具有广泛群众性的艺术形式来说更是如此。同时，根据我们所了解的材料来看，农民群众是具有相当高的欣赏水平的。例如，前面列举的受到农民热烈欢迎的一些影片，都是优秀的或比较好的国产影片。农民在评论影片时，首先看影片是否“有劲”，也即是影片是否具有鼓舞人的力量和重大的教育意义；其次考虑影片是否“有戏”，也即是影片是否具有高度的艺术性。他们很朴素地掌握了毛主席提出的政治与艺术的统一而以政治为第一位的批评标准。他们正是根据这样的标准，来选择自己所喜爱的影片的。
    在农民所喜爱的影片中，优秀的戏曲片和战争题材的影片占有相当大的比重。这种现象是完全可以理解的：戏曲在农村中有着深厚的群众基础和长期流传的历史，农民群众对它的表演在习惯上比较容易接受，说白唱词多半都能听懂，而戏曲片一般都是选择戏曲中经过观众考验的优秀剧目拍摄而成的，演员又大都是该剧种的著名演员，这是农民在平时所不易见到的，因此，农民非常爱看戏曲片。他们说：“看戏曲片比看戏还要过瘾。”虽然，这些都是农民喜爱戏曲片的原因，但更重要的是，他们也要求从戏曲片中同样受到教育和鼓舞。像《百岁挂帅》、《梁山伯与祝英台》、《天仙配》等戏曲片，描写了古代人民斗争生活，表现了人民对外族侵略和封建势力的反抗，反映了人民的意志和要求，因此才获得了广大农民的欢迎。正是由于我们的戏曲片既有正确的健康的思想内容，又有优美的表现形式，才能够成为农民最喜爱的样式之一。
  　同样，农民所以爱看战斗题材的影片，固然因为这些影片情节比较紧张，动作性强，能吸引观众，但更重要的也还是由于我国广大农民亲身经历过长期的反帝反封建斗争，熟悉这方面的生活，而这类影片又都表现了英雄人物在对敌斗争中的勇敢、机智和乐观主义精神，如上海农民举出他们所喜爱的《智取华山》、《渡江侦察记》、《铁道游击队》、《董存瑞》、《上甘岭》、《万水千山》、《无名岛》以及更为中小学生所喜爱的《红孩子》等等，这些影片都是既歌颂了为了革命胜利进行忘我斗争的革命战士，又揭露了敌人的丑恶与无耻。农民说：“看这样的影片，真解恨！”“看了《海鹰》里面我们的海军战士在海里宣誓真感动，自己的劲头比不上他们，应该向他们学习，好好生产。”由此可见，农民喜爱这些影片，正是由于这些影片反映的斗争尖锐，爱憎分明，能够鼓舞他们的斗志，能够成为他们克服困难、战胜敌人的榜样。
    具有强烈的战斗性、塑造了光辉的英雄形象、采取了通俗易懂为农民所喜闻乐见的表现形式，正是这些影片受到农民喜爱的原因。农民的欣赏趣味是并不狭窄的，相反的他们在题材和样式上的要求是多种多样的。一般说来，如果具备上述这样一些特色的影片，不论是什么题材和样式，农民都是喜爱的。不过，这些特色在一些优秀的战斗题材的影片中或戏曲片中表现得比较集中罢了。
    曾经有人根据片面的材料认为农民只喜爱戏曲片和战争题材影片，而不喜爱反映农村生活的影片。这种看法也是非常错误的。恰恰相反，一些优秀的描写农村生活的影片，在农民中间受到极其热烈的欢迎。远一点的如《白毛女》，农民百看不厌，每当放映时，农民奔走相告。最近的如《我们村里的年轻人》、《黄河飞渡》，农民也赞不绝口。有的水库工地上映出了《我们村里的年轻人》后，掀起了“学习《我们村里的年轻人》”的热潮，出现了“年轻人小组”。青年农民说：“看这样的片子，等于开青年积极分子会一样解决问题。”对于《黄河飞渡》，农民反映，看了这样的影片，让人“立雄心、长大志”、“给人以很大的鼓舞”。此外，农民对《刘介梅》、《三八河边》、《五朵金花》等农村题材的影片也很喜爱。在农村题材的影片中，农民尤其要求看反映当前农村生活的影片。他们说：“只要是配合当前政治运动，和农村大跃进有关的，不管故事片、纪录片，我们都喜欢看。”希望看到更多的反映人民公社的故事片，则是当前农村的干部和农民的带有普遍性的要求。
    这样一些具体的生动的事例说明，认为农民不爱看农村题材影片的看法，是缺乏根据的。我们并不否认过去有一些农村题材影片，农民不太感兴趣。这是因为这些影片在内容和形式上还不符合农民的要求，并不是因为它们反映了农村生活。具有类似缺点的其他题材的影片，包括某些战斗题材影片和戏曲片，也同样不受农民的欢迎。正由于我们工作中还存在着这样一些缺点，所以制作农民喜闻乐见的影片，就成为当前创作上的一个重要课题。
    农民不仅喜爱故事影片，也喜欢看纪录片、科学教育片、美术片。他们说：“纪录片真人真事，能结合运动，有时比听报告的效果还大。”在新闻片中，他们特别喜欢影片中有中央领导同志的镜头，每逢银幕上出现了敬爱的领袖毛主席，就全场沸腾，鼓掌欢迎，给大家极大的鼓舞。
    使农民既要看得懂，又要喜欢看，这就对我们的影片提出进一步民族化和群众化的要求。毛主席在《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》一文中指出：“洋八股必须废止，空洞抽象的调头必须少唱，教条主义必须休息，而代之以新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派。”毛主席的这一指示，在文学艺术领域中也就是民族化和群众化的问题。一般说来，愈是民族化的影片，一定愈为群众所喜闻乐见，因此也就愈是群众化的影片。反之，愈是群众化的影片，也就愈有民族特色。我们的戏曲片深受农民欢迎的原因之一，就在于它具有农民所喜闻乐见的民族风格。
    民族化和群众化在电影艺术中之所以成为一个突出的问题，这是因为电影是一种外来的艺术形式，在艺术表现形式上受外国的影响较深。解放以来的十年间，由于我们的电影艺术努力反映中国人民首先是工农兵的生活和斗争，反映新时代的中国人民的思想感情、道德观念、生活习俗，同时在表现形式上也作过一些探索和努力，因此在民族化群众化方面取得了显著的成就。不过，也还有些影片或多或少地残留着一些为中国人民特别是农民群众所不习惯的“洋气”。比如人物的思想感情和作风还不够中国气派，语言有外国腔和知识分子腔，头绪繁多，人物性格的面貌不清楚，叙述方法上的跳来跳去，生硬的回忆镜头，都是农民看不惯或不爱看的。在电影艺术进一步民族化群众化的过程中，这些缺点是必须克服的。不过，仅仅消除这些缺点也还不够，还需要积极地探索和建立新的民族风格。去冬以来，几个主要制片厂都组织了一批电影工作者到不同的地区去征求和搜集农民群众对电影的意见，其中许多意见非常中肯和富有启发性，对于电影艺术进一步民族化群众化有很大的参考价值。
    农民对影片中的性格鲜明的英雄形象，是非常热爱的。在人物塑造上，他们要求性格色彩强烈，棱角分明，而不喜欢面貌模糊不清的人物。同时，他们也反对把人物性格简单化和漫画化。
    农民喜欢看有头有尾、层次分明、交代清楚的影片，也就是要求全剧的结构、故事情节以及人物的性格、身份，人物之间的关系等都能交代清楚，人物性格的发展要有来龙去脉，合乎生活逻辑。但是同时也要求影片的情节曲折，故事性强，而不喜欢“看了前面就知道后面”的影片。他们要求看到具有强烈戏剧冲突的影片，而不喜欢平铺直叙的像报“流水账”似的影片，说看了这样的影片“倒胃口”。对于人物繁多、头绪纷繁、枝节丛生的影片，农民也不大能够接受，认为这样的影片“看起来很吃力，好像进了迷魂阵”。
    把这些意见归纳起来，也就是说，为了支援农业，为了满足广大农民需要，我们的影片必须具有社会主义、共产主义的内容和民族化的艺术表现形式。农民对电影艺术的要求是完全正确的，电影工作者应该满足他们这种要求，民族化和群众化的问题不仅仅是创作农民所需要的影片所必须解决的问题，同时也是我们整个电影艺术所面临的课题。农民不仅要看反映农村生活的影片，而且也需要看各种题材的影片，不过反映农村生活的影片在这方面所担负的任务更加重大和迫切。通过反映农村生活影片的拍摄，将推动我们的电影艺术进一步民族化群众化。电影艺术的更加民族化和群众化，也可以更好地贯彻为工农兵服务的方向，更迅速地攀登世界电影艺术的高峰。
    应该看到，要做到对农民群众有益、而又为他们所喜闻乐见的影片，对今天的电影艺术工作者来说也还不是一件容易的事情。他们必须下很大的决心，作很大的努力，深入下去，和农民群众打成一片。不论剧本、导演、表演，都要力求为农民所能接受、所喜爱，也就是说，制作这些影片必须不折不扣地通过群众路线。
    目前，各故事片厂正在积极地进行适合农村放映的影片的创作，并把这种创作做为一个光荣的政治任务。为了使影片适合农民的需要，许多创作人员下乡征求农民对影片的意见，与农民一起讨论剧本。各新闻纪录片厂，今年也新增加了以在农村发行为主的农村新闻杂志片和纪录片。各科教片厂则已经拍摄和正在拍摄一批配合农业技术改革的科教片。各种影片都在积极支援农业，争取更好地为五亿农民兄弟服务。我们相信，在党的坚强领导下，在创作人员的努力下，不久就会出现一批具有较高思想性和艺术性为农民喜闻乐见的影片。
