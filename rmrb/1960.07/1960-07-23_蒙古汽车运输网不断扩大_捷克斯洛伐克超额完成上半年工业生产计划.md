    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 21st: Mongolia's motor transport industry has made great achievements in the past thirty-five years, playing a significant role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, boosting the economy, and developing production.
    Over the past thirty-five years, Mongolia's motor transport network has continued to expand. Now, each provincial capital has established bus stations with a large number of vehicles. The nation's motor highways stretch for eight thousand six hundred kilometers, and the ranks of automotive technicians are constantly growing. Currently, motor transport handles about 40% of the nation's transportation tasks. Mongolia's motor transport industry was established in 1925. Compared with 1925, the number of automobile drivers has increased by two hundred and three times this year.
    Like other industrial and mining enterprises across the country, Mongolia's motor transport departments have launched a campaign since last year to become Socialist Labor Teams. Currently, within the scope of the motor transport departments, there are twenty-three production teams striving to become Socialist Labor Teams, with more than three hundred people participating. Some production teams have already received this title.
    Currently, the nation's motor transport workers have completed 111.6% of the ton-kilometer plan for the first half of the year and 100.4% of the original kilometer plan. They are working hard to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
