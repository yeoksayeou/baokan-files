Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Blantyre: Approximately 500 African workers from tea plantations in the Cholo district of Nyasaland held a demonstration on the 7th to protest the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in arresting African workers.

According to reports, earlier, the authorities of the Conforzi Plantation, one of the largest colonial tea plantations in Nyasaland, located in the Cholo district, dismissed thirty-five African workers on the pretext of "excessive" personnel. In response to this action by the colonialists, the workers immediately went on strike, expressing strong protest. However, the British colonial authorities dispatched three truckloads of colonial police, who stormed into the plantation, suppressed the striking workers, and arrested one African worker.

The colonialists' brutality further aroused the anger of the African workers. On the 7th, approximately five hundred African workers marched in a column to the local police station, intending to rescue the arrested worker.

The report says that the British colonial authorities once again suppressed the marching workers. Colonial police threw tear gas at the marching column and wielded batons to beat the demonstrating workers.

    新华社8日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰乔洛地方的茶叶种植园的非洲工人约五百人在7日举行示威游行，抗议英国殖民当局逮捕非洲工人的暴行。
    据报道，早些时候，乔洛地方的一家尼亚萨兰最大的殖民者的茶叶种植园——康福兹种植园的当局，以人员“过多”为借口解雇了三十五名非洲工人。针对殖民者的这一行为，工人们立即举行了罢工，表示强烈抗议。但是，英国殖民当局竟派了三卡车殖民警察，冲进这家种植园，对罢工工人进行了镇压，并且逮捕了一名非洲工人。
    殖民者的暴行更加激起了非洲工人的愤怒。7日，约五百名非洲工人列队走向当地警察所，打算营救被捕工人。
    消息说，英国殖民当局再次向游行工人进行镇压。殖民警察向游行队伍投掷了催泪弹，并且挥舞警棍殴打游行的工人。
