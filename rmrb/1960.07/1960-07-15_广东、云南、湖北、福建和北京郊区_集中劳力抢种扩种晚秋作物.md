Guangdong, Yunnan, Hubei, Fujian, and Suburban Beijing
　　Concentrate Labor to Rush-Plant and Expand Late Autumn Crops

　　Guangzhou, July 14th (From Our Newspaper) – Guangdong Province is adopting measures such as highly concentrating labor to strengthen the agricultural production frontline and making every effort to expand the summer planting area to strive for a bumper grain harvest throughout the year.

　　In order to accelerate the pace of summer harvesting and planting and to ensure sufficient labor for future grain production, the Provincial Party Committee recently decided to transfer more than one million laborers from urban areas, state-owned factories, and mines to strengthen the production teams of the communes. In accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities quickly concentrated 80% of the labor force to the forefront of summer harvesting and planting. When summer harvesting and planting became urgent, the Leibei County Party Committee immediately withdrew the entire water conservancy construction army and投入（投入） it into current production, making the labor force on the front line of summer harvesting and planting account for 80% of the county's total labor force. In the past few days, the average daily progress of expanding the planting of coarse grains in the county has reached 15,000 mu, which is two times faster than before the labor force adjustment. Various localities also widely organized urban residents, workers, teachers, and students to go to the countryside to support the rush harvesting and planting. As of the 10th, the province had harvested more than 14.6 million mu of early rice, plowed 12.51 million mu of land, and transplanted more than 2.9 million mu of rice seedlings.

　　The yield of late-season rice in Guangdong has always accounted for 60% of the annual rice yield. Trying every possible means to expand the planting area of late-season rice has become a primary key to striving for increased grain production. To this end, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee required all localities to plant grain crops on all available land and ensure that the area of late rice is expanded to 35 million mu. After various localities conducted land surveys to eliminate wasteland, converted dry land to paddy fields, changed single-season crops to double-season crops, and intercropped and interplanted, the late rice expansion plan has been basically arranged and implemented. Now, while transplanting rice seedlings, various localities are conducting comprehensive inspections, strengthening the management of seedling fields, and quickly replanting insufficient seedlings.

　　Among the measures to ensure increased grain production throughout the year, various localities are also making every effort to expand the planting area of coarse grains. Since May, the province has rushed to plant more than 5.7 million mu of coarse grain crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, and beans.

　　Kunming, July 14th (From Our Newspaper) – Various localities in Yunnan Province are fully tapping the potential of the land and striving to expand the planting of late autumn crops. According to preliminary statistics from Lijiang and Simao and other regions, as well as the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, more than 1.47 million mu of late autumn crops have been planted.

　　Yunnan Province has a lot of wasteland that can be utilized. Many places are evergreen all year round with good natural conditions, and various localities have rich experience in using expanded planting, intercropping, and interplanting to increase grain production. Yuxi Prefecture, which originally had a small cultivated area, is now intercropping and interplanting in general dry land and using various favorable conditions to grow more grain crops. Lijiang Prefecture, which has a wide cultivated area, is actively expanding the planting of buckwheat, oats, broad beans, and other crops, and the expansion plan has been two-thirds completed.

　　Various localities have carefully arranged crop varieties according to the different characteristics of mountainous, semi-mountainous, and dam areas, so as to adapt to local conditions and plant what can be planted. Zhaotong, Qujing, Lijiang, and other regions in the north with cooler climates mainly plant buckwheat, potatoes, and various bean crops. Yuxi, Chuxiong in the central part, and Wenshan, Simao, and other regions and autonomous prefectures in the south mainly plant buckwheat and sweet potatoes and other crops. Maguan County combines tall-stem crops with short-stem crops, and crops with long growth periods with crops with short growth periods, and interplants small miscellaneous grains in corn fields. Xuanwei County, based on its past experience in interplanting and expanding planting, has dispatched more than 30,000 laborers to seize the opportunity of moist soil after rain and rushed to plant more than 280,000 mu of various late autumn crops according to the season.

　　Wuhan, July 14th (From Our Newspaper) – Hubei is focusing on coarse grain production. At present, the planting area of ​​various types of coarse grains in the province has been expanded compared with last year. The vast number of commune members are seizing the great opportunity of sufficient soil moisture after the rain to continue rush planting and strive for more planting and harvesting. In Xiangyang, Enshi and other regions with large coarse grain areas, party committees at all levels personally took command, concentrated leadership, and concentrated labor to plant extensively. In Enshi Prefecture alone, the number of people dispatched daily reached 200,000. Jun County in Xiangyang region has planted 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes, which is one and a half times the planting area last year, and is now organizing forces to continue rush planting. In Huanggang, Wuhan and other regions, many communes, under the slogan of "one mu of sweet potatoes per household," dispatched a large number of commune members every day to open up wasteland, level the land, and plant simultaneously.

　　Grasping the production of both large coarse grains (sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum) and small coarse grains (mung beans, rice beans), and grasping both area and cultivation technique reform are the biggest characteristics of Hubei's coarse grain production this year. In Yingshan County, located in the Dabie Mountains, the planting area of ​​coarse grains has expanded more than three times compared with last year due to strengthened leadership. Xiangyang Prefecture used field corners, front and back of houses to increase the planting of small miscellaneous grains reaching one million mu. Many areas have also adopted the method of intercropping tall and short crops to increase the planting of a large amount of mung beans, soybeans, etc. In the rush planting of coarse grains, various localities have changed the past habit of extensive cultivation. Wuhan, Jingzhou and other regions have vigorously launched the trend of experimental fields and high-yield posts, and carried out competitions between communes and teams to achieve a large-scale balanced increase in production.

　　Fuzhou (Xinhua News Agency) – While rushing to plant late rice, various parts of Fujian Province are also expanding the planting of high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and expanding the planting of melons and vegetables. Up to now, the province has planted more than 2.96 million mu of sweet potatoes, more than 2.26 million mu of coarse grains, more than 1.14 million mu of vegetables, and more than 200 million plants of various melons, all of which are growing well. The planting area of ​​these crops has increased by 35% to more than one time compared with the same period last year.

　　In early June, most areas of Fujian were hit by strong typhoons and exceptionally heavy floods. In order to recover the losses caused by this disaster to crops and strive for a bumper harvest, various localities, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, concentrated more than 80% of the labor force, and while rushing to plant late rice, set off a heat wave of planting sweet potatoes, coarse grains, melons and vegetables. According to the spirit of "there must be planting on the land, and no inch of land should be idle," they vigorously engaged in replanting, intercropping, and wasteland reclamation. Longxi Prefecture used barren mountains, beaches, forest land, and orchards to plant 621,800 mu of sweet potatoes, sorghum, corn, melons, vegetables, etc. Various communes in Fuqing County used the "ten sides" to increase the county's sweet potato area from 120,000 mu to more than 150,000 mu.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, July 14th) – The three major agricultural activities of planting grain, planting vegetables, and weeding are being stepped up in the suburbs of Beijing.

　　In the past week, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has continuously taken a series of measures to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. More than 30,000 obligatory labor troops from factories, schools, agencies, troops, and urban people's communes have all joined the battle. More than 30,000 young and middle-aged commune members transferred from various water conservancy construction sites have returned to agricultural production positions; a large number of laborers tightened from all non-agricultural production departments in various people's communes have also been投入（投入） in agricultural production. More than 4,000 cadres in various counties (districts) in the suburbs have gone deep into the front line of production. At present, the daily progress of rice and sweet potato transplanting has increased by two times compared with ten days ago. Some counties (districts) have completed summer sowing crops and basically eliminated weeds. Although it has rained recently, it is very uneven, and the drought situation in many areas continues to develop. Weeds grow with weeding, and pests are repeatedly removed. The task of agricultural production is still very heavy. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 13th and decided to immediately take the following five emergency measures: (1) Work hard for five and seven days to complete the finishing tasks of rice transplanting and sweet potato planting; (2) Rush to plant summer quick vegetables, fight hard for forty days, and strive to complete the sowing task of autumn vegetables such as big radishes and cabbage before August 10; (3) Work hard for ten days to eliminate weeds, prevent new weeds, and strive to weed all grain and vegetable land three times; (4) Fight natural disasters to the end, and while fighting drought and eliminating insects, prevent floods; (5) While completing the three major tasks of planting grain, planting vegetables, and weeding drought resistance, comprehensively arrange rural work. The Communist Youth League should organize primary and middle school students to plant "ten sides" and plant more melons and vegetables. All agencies, factories, schools, and troops should use nearby open spaces to plant vegetables.

　　In order to complete the above tasks, the Municipal Party Committee requires all localities to further organize the labor force and transfer all available rural labor to the production front, and at the same time decided to increase the number of people participating in voluntary labor to go to the countryside to support agricultural production.

　　集中劳力抢种扩种晚秋作物
    本报广州14日电　广东省采取高度集中劳动力加强农田作业第一线和千方百计扩大夏种面积等措施，争取全年粮食丰收。
    为了加快夏收夏种的速度和保证今后粮食生产有足够的劳动力，最近，省委决定从城市、国营厂矿等部门抽调一百多万劳动力增强公社生产小队。各地根据省委指示，迅速把80％的劳动力集中到夏收夏种的最前线。雷北县当夏收夏种紧迫时，县委便立即把全部水利建设大军抽回投入当前生产，使夏收夏种第一线的劳动力占全县总劳力的80％。近几天全县扩种杂粮平均日进度达一万五千亩，比调整劳动力前加快了两倍。各地还广泛组织城市居民、职工、师生下乡支援抢收抢种。到10日止，全省已收割早稻一千四百六十多万亩，犁田一千二百五十一万亩，插秧二百九十多万亩。
    广东晚造水稻的产量向来都占全年水稻产量的60％，想尽一切办法扩大晚造种植面积，就成为争取粮食增产的一个首要关键。为此，广东省委要求各地尽一切可能把能够利用的土地都种上粮食作物，确保晚稻面积扩大到三千五百万亩。经过各地进行查荒灭荒、旱地改水田、单造改双造和间种套种，晚稻扩种计划已基本安排落实。现在，各地正在插秧的同时，进行全面检查，加强秧田管理，迅速补播不足的秧苗。
    在保证全年粮食增产措施中，各地还千方百计扩大杂粮种植面积。5月以来，全省已抢种了番薯、玉米、高粱、豆类等杂粮作物五百七十多万亩。
    本报昆明14日电　云南省各地充分挖掘土地潜力，尽力扩种晚秋作物。据丽江、思茅等专区和大理白族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州的初步统计，已种下晚秋作物一百四十七万多亩。
    云南省可以利用的荒地很多，许多地方四季常青，自然条件很好，各地都有利用扩种、间作、套种增产粮食的丰富经验。原来耕地面积少的玉溪专区，正在一般旱地内套种、间种，利用各种有利条件多种粮食作物。耕地面积宽广的丽江专区，正积极扩种荞麦、燕麦、四季豆等作物，扩种计划已完成三分之二。
    各地根据山区、半山区和坝区的不同特点，认真安排了作物品种，做到因地因时制宜，能种什么就种什么。北部的昭通、曲靖、丽江等气候较凉的专区，都以种植荞麦、马铃薯和各种豆类作物为主；中部的玉溪、楚雄和南部的文山、思茅等专区、自治州，都以种植荞麦和红薯等作物为主。马关县把高秆作物与矮秆作物、生长期长与生长期短的作物搭配起来，在苞谷地里套种小杂粮。宣威县根据过去套种扩种的经验，抽出三万多个劳动力，抓紧雨后土地湿润的时机，抢节令种下了各种晚秋作物二十八万多亩。
    本报武汉14日电　湖北各地大抓杂粮生产。目前，全省各类杂粮的播种面积都比去年扩大，广大社员正抓紧雨后墒足的大好时机，继续抢种，力争多种多收。杂粮面积较大的襄阳、恩施等地区，各级党委亲自挂帅，集中领导，集中劳力，大栽大种。仅恩施专区每天出动的人数就达二十万人。襄阳地区的均县已栽红苕五十万亩，比去年种植面积扩大了一倍半，现正组织力量继续抢栽。黄冈、武汉等地区许多公社在“每户一亩苕”的口号下，每天出动大批社员，边开荒、边整地、边种植。
    既抓大宗杂粮（红苕、苞谷、高粱）生产，又抓小宗杂粮（绿豆、饭豆）生产；既抓面积又抓耕作技术改革，是今年湖北杂粮生产中的最大特点。地处大别山区的英山县，由于加强了领导，杂粮播种面积比去年扩大了三倍多。襄阳专区利用田头地角、房前屋后增种的小宗杂粮达一百万亩。许多地区还采取高矮作物间作的办法，增种了大量绿豆、黄豆等。在抢种杂粮中，各地改变了过去耕作粗放的习惯。武汉、荆州等地区大兴办试验田、丰产岗之风，开展社与社、队与队之间的竞赛，以实现大面积平衡增产。
    据新华社福州讯　福建省各地在抢种晚稻同时，大量扩种甘薯等高产作物和扩种瓜菜。到目前为止，全省已种下甘薯二百九十六万多亩，杂粮二百二十六万多亩，蔬菜一百一十四万多亩，各种瓜类二亿多株，生长都很好。这些作物的种植面积都分别比去年同期扩大35％到一倍以上。
    6月上旬，福建大部地区遭受强台风和特大洪水的侵袭，为了夺回农作物因这次灾害所造成的损失，力争丰收，各地在党委统一领导下，集中80％以上的劳力，一面抢种晚稻一面掀起大种甘薯、杂粮、瓜菜等作物的热潮，根据“有地必种，寸土不闲”的精神，大搞复种套种和开荒。龙溪专区利用荒山、海滩、林地和果园等种下甘薯、高粱、玉米、瓜菜等六十二万一千八百多亩。福清县各公社利用“十边”，使全县甘薯面积由十二万亩增至十五万多亩。
    据新华社14日讯　北京郊区种粮、种菜、锄草三大农事活动正在加紧进行。
    在最近一周中，中共北京市委连续采取一系列措施，加强了对农业生产的领导。来自工厂、学校、机关、部队和城市人民公社的三万多名义务劳动大军已全部投入战斗。从各水利工地抽调的三万多名青壮年社员已经回到农业生产岗位；各人民公社从一切非农业生产部门中紧缩出来的大批劳动力，也都投入农业生产。郊区各县（区）四千多名干部都已深入到生产第一线。目前水稻、白薯插秧的日进度较十天以前增加了两倍，有些县
  （区）已经种完夏播作物，基本消灭了草荒。最近虽已降雨，但很不平衡，许多地区的旱情仍在继续发展，杂草随锄随长，害虫屡除屡生，农业生产任务仍十分重。因此，中共北京市委在13日举行会议，决定立即采取以下五项紧急措施：（一）大干五天和七天，分别完成水稻插秧、白薯栽种的扫尾任务；（二）抢种夏季快菜，大战四十天，力争在8月10日前完成大萝卜、大白菜等秋菜的播种任务；（三）大干十天，消灭草荒，防止新荒，所有的粮菜地都要力争锄草三遍；（四）和自然灾害斗争到底，在抗旱灭虫的同时，要防止涝灾；（五）在完成种粮、种菜、锄草抗旱三大任务的同时，全面安排农村工作。共青团要组织中小学生大种“十边”，多种瓜菜。各机关、工厂、学校、部队都要利用附近的空地种上蔬菜。
    为了完成上述任务，市委要求各地进一步组织好劳动力，把一切可以调动的农村劳力都调到生产战线上去，同时决定增加参加义务劳动的人数，下乡支援农业生产。（附图片）
