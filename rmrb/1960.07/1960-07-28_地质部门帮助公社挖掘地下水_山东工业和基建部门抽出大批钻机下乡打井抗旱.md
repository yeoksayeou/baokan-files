Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Geological departments in drought-stricken areas across the country are actively surveying groundwater and drilling machine wells to support the agricultural fight against drought. In the North China region, geological departments have dispatched 400 drilling rigs to support drought relief in the countryside; in the South, Guangxi, Guizhou and other places are also providing data for the development of water sources.

Building machine wells on a large scale and making full use of groundwater is a drought resistance measure that uses less materials, requires less labor, and yields quick results. Geological exploration drilling rigs are sharp tools for drilling holes and sinking wells. Therefore, as soon as the drought appeared, geological departments in various places, under the leadership of local Party committees, organized drought relief teams, carrying drilling rigs to the countryside to fight the drought. Hebei Province, which is more severely affected by the drought, has now dispatched more than 200 drilling rigs to the countryside. The industrial departments of Henan Province have also transferred more than 100 drilling rigs to the countryside, including 40 from the geological departments. The enthusiasm of the workers is very high. Many people, upon arriving in the countryside, drop their backpacks and immediately erect drill towers, install drilling rigs, and join the peasants in the fight against drought. The Shanxi Geological Bureau supported the well-drilling teams in Xiding, Yuci, Pingyao, and other places, and their enthusiasm soared. Recently, they have drilled more than 90 machine well boreholes, of which 49 are artesian wells and have already sprayed water to irrigate the fields. These artesian wells discharge more than 190,000 tons of water per day and night, which can irrigate more than 30,000 mu of land. The masses praised the artesian wells, saying: No need for machines, no need for oil, clear water flows all year round, the worker brothers are powerful, and the artesian wells ensure a bumper harvest.

In order to support the fight against drought, geological departments in various places have also strengthened the general survey and detailed survey of groundwater. At present, groundwater resources in about 2 million square kilometers across the country have been generally surveyed. Through detailed groundwater surveys in the North China Plain, the Hexi Corridor, the Guanzhong Plain, and Xinjiang and other places, groundwater reserves have been further clarified. After the general survey in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, the geological departments have compiled maps of groundwater distribution and resources for exploitation and utilization. During the general survey, the staff also helped communes train many groundwater observers and established nearly 100 groundwater observation stations. These efforts have powerfully promoted the development of groundwater. According to the groundwater distribution in the Longdong area of ​​Gansu, more than 100,000 deep wells have been dug on the Loess Plateau at an altitude of 1,500 meters in the past few months. Many wells are also connected to each other, with open channels and concealed passages intertwined, forming a huge underground river network.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: Shandong industrial and basic construction departments dispatched a large number of drilling rigs to the countryside to sink wells and fight drought, solving the problem of production and domestic water use for people in some areas. Up to now, 39 drilling rigs have been transferred from units such as the Provincial Geological Bureau, the Coal Bureau, the Metallurgical Bureau, the Ministry of Railways Survey and Design Institute, and the Jinan Water Conservancy Headquarters, and have successively headed to Jinan, Heze, Jining, Liaocheng and other regions. The faster ones have already completed machine wells. The Provincial Geological Bureau has seven drilling rigs operating in the Jinan area and Pingyin County, and has completed four machine wells in the southern suburbs of Licheng County. Among them, two machine wells can pump more than 300 tons of water per day and night, solving the drinking water problem that has not been solved locally for many years.

The work of sinking wells to fight drought is being carried out by the province's industrial and basic construction units in accordance with the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, adopting the method of contracting by region. At the same time, it has also received strong support from the Ministry of Geology and relevant geological schools. The Shandong Drought Relief Working Group of the Ministry of Geology, the Provincial Geological Bureau, and the Pingyin County Party Committee conducted specific research on the drought relief work in Pingyin County. According to the geological, transportation, exploration and water supply conditions in the water-scarce areas, they determined the hole positions and decided to adopt coreless drilling to improve drilling efficiency. At present, two drilling rigs have started drilling in Pingyin County. More than 140 teachers and students from the hydrogeology class of Zhengzhou Geological School and the geophysical prospecting department of Beijing Geological Institute, who came to Shandong to help fight the drought, have also gone to Heze, Jining, Jinan and other areas to help with exploration and well drilling.

    地质部门帮助公社挖掘地下水
    山东工业和基建部门抽出大批钻机下乡打井抗旱
    新华社讯　全国各受旱地区地质部门职工积极查地下水、凿机井，支援农业抗旱斗争。华北地区地质部门支援抗旱下乡的钻机，现在已达四百台；南方广西、贵州等地也正在为开发水源提供资料。
    大建机井、充分利用地下水是一项用材少、费工小、收效快的抗旱措施，地质勘探的钻机又是打孔凿井的利器，因此，旱情一露头，各地地质部门就在当地党委领导下，纷纷组织了抗旱队伍携带钻机下乡抗旱。受旱较重的河北省现已下乡钻机二百多台，河南省工业部门也抽调了一百多台钻机下乡，其中有地质部门四十台。职工们抗旱热情很高，许多人到乡下甩下背包，就下田矗钻塔、装钻机，和农民一道投入了抗旱斗争。山西地质厅支援忻定、榆次、平遥等地的钻井队，干劲冲天，最近已钻了九十多个机井钻孔，其中有四十九眼自流井并已喷水灌田，这些自流井一昼夜出水十九万多吨，可浇地三万多亩。山东、河南等省地质部门把钻机运到抗旱水源最困难的地方，探查地下水，使不少地方在一向缺水的“火龙岗”上，找到了水泉。现在，河南地质部门支援抗旱的钻机已打成自流井二十多眼，一眼井的涌水量约相当于五十部水车。群众称赞自流井说：不用机器不用油，一年四季清水流，工人大哥力量大，自流水井保丰收。
    为了支援抗旱斗争，各地地质部门还加强了地下水的普查和详查工作。目前，全国约有二百多万平方公里的地下水资源已经经过普查，华北平原、河西走廊、关中平原和新疆等地通过地下水的详查工作，并已进一步查明了地下水储量。山东、河南等省普查后，地质部门并已编制出地下水分布图和开采利用的资源。普查中，职工们还帮助公社培训了许多地下水观察员，建立了近百处地下水观测站。这些工作有力地促进了地下水的开发，甘肃陇东地区根据地下水分布情况，在海拔一千五百米的黄土高原上，几个月来已凿成深井十多万眼，有很多井还互相串连，明渠暗道交错，组成了巨大的地下河网。
    新华社济南26日电　山东工业和基本建设部门抽出大批钻机下乡打井抗旱，解决某些地区人民的生产和生活用水问题。到现在为止，已经有省地质厅、煤炭局、冶金厅、铁道部勘测设计院和济南市水利指挥部等单位，共抽调出三十九台钻探机，先后开赴济南、菏泽、济宁、聊城等地区。进度快的已经打成了机井。省地质厅在济南地区和平阴县的钻机已有七台开钻，并且已在历城县南郊公社打成四座机井，其中有两座机井每昼夜可抽水三百吨以上，解决了当地多年没有解决的饮水问题。
    打井抗旱的工作，是省的工业和基本建设单位根据中共山东省委的指示，采用分片包干的办法进行的。同时，也得到了地质部和有关地质学校的大力帮助。地质部山东抗旱工作组、省地质厅和平阴县委一道，对平阴县的抗旱工作进行了具体研究。他们根据缺水地区地质、交通及勘探供水等方面的条件，确定了孔位，并且确定采取无岩心钻进，以提高钻探效率。目前在平阴县已有两台钻机开钻。来山东帮助抗旱的郑州地质学校水文地质班和北京地质学院物探系一百四十多名师生，也已分别到菏泽、济宁、济南等地区帮助勘探、打井。
