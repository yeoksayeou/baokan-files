To further perfect the "Two-Five System" leadership method and improve work standards, Wuqiao summarizes new experiences of "Learn, Do, Transfer, Help."

(This newspaper) News report. Since February this year, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, has implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, with a total of 2,555 cadres at all levels going to the front line, participating in production, and leading production. Their work is becoming more detailed, and their style is becoming more practical.

After these cadres went to the front line, the vast majority were able to eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, both staying at fixed points and moving across areas, both participating in production and leading production. More than 70% of county-level organs regularly keep their cadres involved in labor and work in production teams, with one-third to two-thirds of the cadres settling down in production teams to work permanently; the vast majority of commune and management district cadres have already been assigned to fixed teams; and about 70% of cadres in various business departments also regularly go to the front line, participating in production and leading production while carrying out their business work. However, some cadres, due to a lack of work experience, are not doing enough comprehensively. Some focus on participating in production and do not pay enough attention to leading production better; others emphasize leading production and do not pay enough attention to participating in production better. In light of this situation, the Wuqiao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the vast number of cadres to summarize their experiences in participating in production and leading production, and each commune also established role models in this regard to organize cadres to learn, which has raised the work level of the vast number of cadres a step further.

Their main experiences summarized are:

(1) It is necessary to study conscientiously, learn from books, learn from practice, learn from grassroots cadres, and learn from the masses. At the same time, conduct serious analysis in learning, analyzing what is advanced and should be promoted, and what is backward and should be helped to improve. For example, Pang Jinkun, secretary of the General Branch of the Xuyangpi Management District of the Sangyuan Commune, in order to learn the experience of planting in alkaline land this spring, held a forum for old farmers and specifically summarized the experience of preserving cotton seedlings in alkaline land. After analysis, he promoted the scientific method of low-ridge operation in alkaline land throughout the management district, enabling the 2,100 mu of alkaline cotton fields in the management district to obtain full seedlings. Jin Shuzhong, Jiang Yanchen, and Tian Zhongyi, cadres of the Shuangliudian Brigade of the Chengguan Commune, learned cotton fine pruning, skillful fertilization, and insect removal techniques by studying books and promoted them throughout the brigade, enabling the brigade's more than 6,000 mu of cotton to be scientifically managed.

(2) "Do" with purpose and planning, so that you are not only an ordinary laborer, earnestly participating in production, but also pay attention to discovering key problems and strengthening leadership over production. Zhang Shoukai, secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, generally spent two days squatting at a point and participating in production during his five days of in-depth work. When participating in production, he appeared as an ordinary laborer and worked with the commune members, participating in production for two to three days each week; since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," he has worked for 52 workdays in more than five months, and each time he finished laboring, he asked the commune members to evaluate his work and record points. But the difference between his participation in production and that of the commune members is that he focuses on grasping key issues with purpose and planning. At the end of May this year, when he was working in the Chengguan Commune, the tasks of drought-resistant planting, wheat harvesting, and seedling preservation were crowded together. He believed that wheat harvesting was the focus of work at that time, and it was necessary to seize the wheat harvest to drive other farm work. He went to the second team of the Shuangliudian Brigade to participate in wheat harvesting. When he arrived at the team, he found that the team cadres were not paying close attention to the wheat harvest, thinking that the wheat was not ripe enough, fearing that harvesting too early would reduce production, and the work point quota was not reasonable enough. Zhang Shoukai felt that the wheat had already matured, and if it was not harvested quickly, losses would be caused if disasters such as wind, hail, and rain were encountered. On the one hand, he called the Commune Party Committee, and on the other hand, he discussed with the brigade general branch secretary and convened a small team leader meeting to unify their thinking and make a resolution to complete the wheat harvest in three days, and revise the work point quota. The Commune Party Committee also strengthened its leadership over the wheat harvesting work of other production teams. From then on, the progress of wheat harvesting in the whole commune increased from 3,000 mu per day to 8,000 mu, and 30,000 mu of wheat was harvested in just over three days.

(3) Truly "transfer" well, achieve comprehensive transfer, grasp key points, promote the backward, and catch up with the advanced. In order to grasp the overall work situation of the county, Peng Guangfeng, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, in addition to listening to the reports of the office and the secretaries of the Commune Party Committees, often went to the communes in a planned way to transfer, and each time he transferred, he focused on solving problems. When the drought was most intense in May, the communes were urgently using water like stars, and in order to solve the contradiction of using water on one channel between the four communes of Daqizhuang, Sangyuan, Chengguan, and Qianguozhuang, he inspected from the head of the canal to the end of the canal, checking each commune and section by section, and properly solved the problem. Wang Juwen, director of the Daqi Commune, was in charge of four brigades. In early July, the whole commune had a thorough rain, and it was necessary to carry out inter-tillage immediately. When he transferred to the area, he focused on inspecting the farm work of inter-tillage and weeding, and first went to the backward production areas. When he transferred to the area between Xiaomachang, Luoxin, and Taozhuang villages, and found a piece of 600 mu of weedy wasteland, he immediately went deep into the three teams, organized 110 laborers, and launched a surprise attack on the reclamation. In one and a half days, the 600 mu of seedlings were ploughed once, achieving weed removal and soil loosening.

(4) Grasp the baseline, look at the thinking, check the plan, give ideas, make arrangements, summarize experience, and strengthen assistance to grassroots cadres. In early July, when Zhang Shoukai, secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, went to work in the Sangyuan Commune, the Commune Party Committee reported its plan and measures for planting 24,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes. He found that their plan was too large, and there were not enough seedlings and labor. After calculating the account of seedlings and labor, he could only complete 16,000 mu by July 12, so he helped them make more specific and detailed arrangements, and researched double insurance measures. Li Fuyin, secretary of the County Political Consultative Conference, worked and served as a consultant in the second team of the Cangshang Management District of the Chengguan Commune. He found that the team cadres held meetings every night and recorded work until late at night, and the cadres and commune members were very tired. After discussing with the team cadres, he helped them improve the meeting methods and changed the evening work recording to field work recording. The cadres and commune members were happy to have both work and leisure, and they were all very satisfied.

Cadres at all levels went to the front line to participate in production and lead production, deeply publicized and implemented the Party's policies and guidelines, further strengthened the relationship with the masses, fully mobilized the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the masses, and production continued to reach new highs. Now, the county has fully completed the sowing task of 1.5 million mu of summer fields. More than 1 million mu of spring seedlings have been ploughed once or twice, more than 400,000 mu of spring seedlings have been fertilized once, and 650,000 mu of spring seedlings have been de-wormed once. Recently, a mass movement to fight for a hundred days to win a bumper harvest in autumn has been launched.

    使“二五制”领导方法更加完善把工作水平再提高一步
    吴桥总结“学、干、转、帮”新经验
    本报讯　河北省吴桥县自今年2月推行“二五制”领导方法以来，各级干部共二千五百五十五名深入第一线，参加生产，领导生产，工作越作越细致，作风越来越踏实。
    这些干部深入第一线以后，绝大多数能与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，既蹲点又转面，既参加生产，又领导生产。县一级机关经常保持70％以上的干部深入到生产小队去劳动和工作，其中有三分之一到三分之二的干部在生产队落脚蹲点，常年固定包队；公社和管理区绝大多数干部都已经固定包队；各业务部门的干部也经常有70％左右深入到第一线去，一面参加生产领导生产，一面开展业务工作。但是也有一些干部，由于缺乏工作经验，做的还不够全面，他们或者偏重参加生产，不大注意更好地领导生产；或者强调领导生产，不大注意更好地参加生产。中共吴桥县委根据这一情况，发动广大干部总结了参加生产领导生产的经验，各公社还树立了这方面的标兵，组织干部学习，使广大干部的工作水平提高了一步。
    他们总结出来的主要经验是：
    （一）要认真地学习，向书本学习，向实际学习，向基层干部学习，向群众学习，同时在学习中要认真进行分析，分析哪是先进的该推广的，哪是落后的该帮助改进的。如桑元公社徐羊皮管理区总支书记庞金坤，在今春为了学习碱地播种的经验，召开老农座谈会，专门总结了碱地保棉苗的经验，经过分析，将合乎科学的碱地低垅作业法在全管理区作了推广，使管理区二千一百亩碱地棉田获得了全苗。城关公社双刘店大队干部靳树忠、姜延臣、田忠义，通过向书本学习，学会了棉花细整枝、巧施肥和除虫技术，在全大队作了推广，使全大队六千多亩棉花得到了科学管理。
    （二）要有目的有计划地“干”，做到既是一个普通劳动者，认真参加生产，又注意发现关键性的问题，加强对生产的领导。县委书记处书记张寿凯在深入工作的五天中，一般两天蹲点，参加生产。他在参加生产时，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现和社员在一块干活，每周能参加二至三天的生产；从执行“二五制”以来，五个多月做了五十二个劳动日，每次劳动结束都叫社员们给他评工记分。但他参加生产和社员不一样的地方就是有目的有计划地抓关键问题。今年5月底，他在城关公社工作时，抗旱点种、收麦、保苗等活计挤在一起了，他认为收麦是当时的工作重点，必须抓住麦收带起其他农活，便到双刘店大队二小队参加收麦。到队里发现队干部对收麦抓得不紧，认为麦子不十分熟，怕收早了减产，工分定额也不够合理。张寿凯觉得麦子已经成熟，如果不抢收，一旦遇上风、雹、雨等灾害，就要造成损失。他一方面打电话告诉公社党委，一方面和大队总支书记商量，召开了小队长会议，统一了思想，作出了三天完成麦收的决议，并修订了工分定额。公社党委对别的生产队的麦收工作也加强了领导。从此，全公社收麦进度由每日三千亩提高到八千亩，三万亩麦子三天多就收完了。
    （三）要切实“转”好，做到转全面、抓重点，促落后、赶先进。县委第一书记彭广峰为了掌握起全县的工作情况，除听取办公室和各公社党委书记的汇报以外，还常有计划地到各公社去转，每次转面都有重点地解决问题。5月间抗旱最紧张的时候，各公社用水急如星火，他为了解决大齐庄、桑园、城关、前郭庄四个公社在一个渠道上用水的矛盾，从渠头检查到渠尾，逐社逐段地检查，妥善地解决了问题。大齐公社主任王巨文分包着四个大队，7月上旬全社落了透雨，需要马上进行中耕，他转面时就重点地检查中耕除草这项农活，并首先到生产落后的地方去。当他转到小马厂、罗辛、桃庄三个村之间，发现有六百亩的一片草荒地时，立即深入到三个小队，组织一百一十名劳力，突击抢荒。一天半的时间就把六百亩小苗普锄一遍，达到草净土松。
    （四）要抓底数、看思想、查计划、出主意、作安排，总结经验，加强对基层干部的帮助。7月上旬，县委书记处书记张寿凯到桑园公社工作时，公社党委汇报了种二万四千亩夏山芋的计划和措施以后，他发现他们的计划偏大，秧苗、劳动力都不够用，经过算秧苗劳力账，到7月12日只能完成一万六千亩，于是帮助他们作了更具体、细致的安排，研究出了双保险的措施。县政协秘书李福荫在城关公社仓上管理区二小队边劳动边当参谋，发现队干部每天晚上开会记工熬到下一点，干部社员都很疲劳，经过和队干部商量，帮助他们改进了开会方法，把晚上记工改为地头记工，干部社员有劳有逸，都很满意。
    各级干部深入第一线参加生产领导生产，深入宣传贯彻了党的方针政策，进一步密切了与群众的关系，充分调动了群众的政治热情和生产积极性，生产不断出现新高潮。现在全县已全部完成了一百五十万亩夏田的播种任务。一百多万亩春苗已普遍锄过一至二遍，有四十多万亩春苗追了一次肥，六十五万亩春苗除了一次虫。最近又展开了大战一百天夺取秋季大丰收的群众运动。
