    Put the Main Labor Force in the Fields
    How labor is allocated in various production departments is a major issue closely related to the high-speed and proportionate development of socialist construction. Rural labor must be mainly used in agricultural production, and currently, it should be concentrated on field operations. Only by truly achieving this can we conform to the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and earnestly implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations.
    Labor is the decisive factor in production. From the perspective of the entire country and society, under the current conditions, if sufficient labor is not used in agricultural production, the foundation of the national economy cannot be consolidated. From the perspective of rural people's communes, if priorities are not clearly distinguished between grain and other major crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and labor is not correctly allocated, grain production and diversified operations will not correspond to the proportions stipulated in the national plan. In addition, in current production and capital construction, in production, construction, and service industries, in productive capital construction and non-productive capital construction, in collective economy and team economy, and in economic undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings, overall planning must be carried out for labor, prioritizing based on importance and urgency, and allocating and using it rationally.
    Since the Party Central Committee further affirmed the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and grain as the key link while comprehensively developing diversified operations, most regions have paid attention to aligning labor allocation with this policy. However, the implementation varies, with some doing well and others not so well. The fundamental reason for improper labor allocation in some regions and units is that some comrades have not truly understood the extreme importance of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link. From a working and ideological perspective, they have not distinguished between major and minor contradictions and do not understand the significance of concentrating major forces to solve major contradictions for promoting the overall situation. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Concentrating troops seems easy, but it is quite difficult to implement. Everyone knows that defeating the few with the many is the best method, but many people cannot do it. On the contrary, they often disperse their forces because the leader lacks strategic thinking, is confused by the complex environment, and is therefore dominated by the environment, loses autonomy, and adopts opportunism." ("Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War") How can we avoid being confused by the complex environment and constantly maintain a clear and firm strategic mind? First, we must resolutely and conscientiously act in accordance with the policies and guidelines clearly stipulated by the Party Central Committee; second, we must comprehensively and deeply investigate and study the actual situation of our region and unit. By closely combining the two, we can ensure that the labor plan for the whole year or a longer period is compatible with the strategic policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link; at the same time, we can fully leverage the superiority of the people's commune, and in each season and each stage of agricultural activities, we can uniformly and flexibly allocate labor under the guidance of the overall strategic policy.
    According to the Party's policies and guidelines, we must first invest sufficient strength in agricultural production and mobilize forces from all aspects to support agricultural production. The arrangement and use of rural labor actually includes two aspects: one aspect is the arrangement and use of labor by the entire country and society, and the other aspect is the arrangement and use of labor within the people's commune. Since the Great Leap Forward, the country's various construction undertakings have been advancing rapidly, and it is reasonable and appropriate to transfer a certain amount of labor from agriculture to participate in and support these constructions. However, it is wrong and inappropriate for some places to transfer too much rural labor, which affects agricultural production. In the future, no department should directly recruit workers or transfer labor from rural areas; when needed, it should be uniformly allocated by the local Party committee. When dealing with rural labor issues, the Party committee should also adhere to the principle of not affecting the faster development of agricultural production. Within the people's commune, it is even more necessary to use the main labor force for agricultural production, correctly handle the relationship between production and capital construction, agricultural production and industrial production, various industries of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, grain production and other crops in agricultural production, as well as production undertakings and welfare undertakings, economic construction and cultural construction, etc., to ensure that the main labor force is used more in agricultural production and on the front line of production. The people's commune is a socio-economic organization with a comprehensive range of industries, including workers, peasants, commerce, education, and military affairs. It is certainly wrong not to extract a certain amount of labor to engage in industry, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., but first, we should ensure that agriculture is done well, and among agriculture, we should first focus on grain and industrial raw material crops. Otherwise, not only will agricultural production be greatly affected, but other production and construction undertakings will also inevitably fail to develop quickly.
    In rural areas, the general direction of attack is agricultural production, and the largest labor force should be concentrated in this area. Manpower should be proportionately allocated to field production teams and various specialized teams in accordance with the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations; it is also necessary to adapt to the specific circumstances of different periods, organize large-scale cooperation, sometimes supporting field production, and sometimes launching surprise attacks on other production. The labor occupied by other undertakings must not only be controlled within a certain proportion, but also, as far as possible, participate in agricultural production during the busy farming season and in commune industry or other undertakings during the slack season according to the principle of "one specialty with multiple skills." Personnel engaged in rural cultural and educational undertakings and collective welfare undertakings should resolutely not leave agricultural production if they can avoid it. The facts are very obvious: in areas and units where labor is used evenly or where importance is reversed, the foundation of agriculture is not solid, and the key link of grain has not been raised, so other tasks are greatly affected. In areas and units where combat forces are correctly deployed in accordance with the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, agricultural production is done well, and all other industries are thriving, and all tasks are very proactive.
    After a clear understanding of the Party's policies and guidelines, the most important thing to ensure the implementation of policies and guidelines is to investigate and study the actual situation. After investigating and studying the labor situation in both urban and rural areas of the entire province, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee not only resolutely transferred labor excessively occupied by some enterprises back to the countryside, but also correctly stipulated the proportion of labor allocation in grain production, diversified operations, industrial transportation, and welfare undertakings, and also stipulated the methods for students and cadres to participate in production. In this way, the entire province can mobilize one million people to return to production teams to strengthen field operations. At least 2,200 rice transplanters are needed for transplanting intermediate rice in Zhengyi People's Commune in Kunshan, Jiangsu. However, only 1,100 people went to the fields when transplanting began, which could not guarantee timely transplanting. Was it impossible to transfer more labor to transplant rice? Jiang Yuanwen, the first secretary of the county party committee, and Jiang Zhenzhong, the secretary of the county party committee, went to the fields, pig farms, canteens, sideline teams, irrigation and drainage project construction sites, and other places to conduct investigations and studies with grassroots cadres and the masses, and found that a large amount of labor could be tapped by improving work methods, rationally arranging manpower, and adjusting work schedules. As a result of the adjustment, the number of people in this commune participating in intermediate rice transplanting increased to more than 3,300, and the transplanting work was completed five days ahead of schedule. Will this only take care of the fields and lose sight of other things? No, it won't. The key is: careful calculation, rational arrangement, improved technology, and improved tools. Many rural canteens and commune-run industrial and sideline workers have reduced by about half, and they are doing as well as in the past. The main reason is that tool reforms have been carried out. Work that can be done by weak labor should not be done by strong labor, those who can do several jobs concurrently should do several jobs, things that can be done later should be resolutely postponed, and institutions that can be streamlined should be resolutely streamlined. A lot of labor can be saved by carefully arranging these aspects. In doing so, other work will not be lost, but will be placed in the second and third positions that they should originally occupy. These second and third positions should also revolve around the first position and serve the first position.
    When arranging the labor force needed for economic projects at all levels and various production projects, one cannot only look at the quantity. In agricultural production, not only should more labor be concentrated on the front line, but a certain number of strong laborers should also be concentrated. To achieve this, the leaders of each region and each commune must go to the front line to see the actual situation clearly and take some practical measures. In addition to deploying troops according to the overall strategic plan, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen political work, improve labor organization and labor management, so that every labor force can fully play its role.
    The situation of the entire economic construction is very good, and the enthusiasm of the commune members is very high. As long as each region and each people's commune concentrates the main labor force on the front line of agricultural production and organizes and uses it correctly and rationally, it will surely achieve greater victories on the agricultural front, better play the basic role of agriculture, and promote the faster advancement of the entire socialist construction.

### 把主要劳动力用在田间

    把主要劳动力用在田间
    劳动力在各个生产部门怎样分配，是同社会主义建设的高速度按比例发展有最密切的关系的一件大事情。农村劳动力必须主要用在农业生产上，当前更要集中地用在田间作业上。只有确实做到了这一点，才合乎国民经济以农业为基础的原则，才是认真地执行以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针。
    劳动力是生产中的决定因素。从整个国家、社会上来说，在当前的条件下，如果不把足够的劳动力用在农业生产上，国民经济的基础就不可能巩固。从农村人民公社来说，如果在粮食、其它主要作物的种植业和林业、牧业、副业、渔业等方面不能分清主次，把劳动力作正确的调配，粮食生产和多种经营就会同国家计划规定的比例不相适应。此外，在当前生产方面和基本建设方面，在生产、建设方面和服务性行业方面，在生产性基本建设方面和非生产性基本建设方面，在社有经济方面和队有经济方面，在经济事业方面和文教事业方面，对于劳动力都要通盘筹划，分别轻重缓急，合理调配使用。
    自从党中央进一步确定国民经济以农业为基础和农业以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针以来，大部分地区都注意了使劳动力的调配同这样的方针相适应。可是，执行的情况各不相同，有的做得很好，有的做得不大好。一些地区和单位对劳动力分配不当的根本原因，是有些同志对于以农业为基础和以粮为纲的极端重要的意义没有真正理解。从工作方法和思想方法上来说，是没有分清主要矛盾和次要矛盾，不了解集中主要力量解决主要矛盾对于推动全局的意义。毛泽东同志说：“集中兵力看来容易，实行颇难。人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法，然而很多人不能做，相反地每每分散兵力，原因就在于指导者缺乏战略头脑，为复杂的环境所迷惑，因而被环境所支配，失掉自主能力，采取了应付主义。”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）要想不为复杂的环境所迷惑，经常保持清醒而坚定的战略头脑，怎么办？第一，要坚决地认真地按照党中央明确规定的政策方针办事；第二，要全面地深入地调查研究本地区本单位的实际情况。把两者密切结合起来，就可以确保全年或者一个较长时期内的劳动规划同以农业为基础和以粮为纲的战略方针相适应；同时，又能充分发挥人民公社的优越性，每个季节、每个农事活动阶段都能在总的战略方针指导之下统一地、灵活地调配劳动力。
    按照党的政策方针，首先要用足够的力量投入农业生产，而且要动员各方面的力量支援农业生产。农村劳动力的安排和使用问题，实际上包括着两个方面的问题，一个方面是整个国家整个社会对劳动力的安排和使用，一个方面是人民公社内部对劳动力的安排和使用。大跃进以来，国家的各项建设事业都在突飞猛进，农业上抽调出一定的劳动力去参加和支援这些建设是合理的，应该的。但是，有的地方抽调农村劳动力太多，以致影响了农业生产，则是不对的，不应该的。今后，任何部门都不应该直接向农村招收工人或抽调劳动力，需要时可通过当地党委统一调配。党委在处理农村劳动力问题时，也要根据以不影响农业生产更快发展的原则。人民公社内部则更需要把主要劳动力用于农业生产，正确处理生产和基本建设，农业生产和工业生产、林牧副渔各业生产，农业生产中的粮食生产和其他作物的生产，以及生产事业和福利事业，经济建设和文化建设等等方面的关系，保证把主要的劳动力更多地用于农业生产，用于生产第一线。人民公社是一个工农商学兵五业俱全的社会经济组织，不抽出一定劳力去搞工业、搞文化教育事业等等当然是不对的，但首先应该保证把农业搞好，农业中又首先抓粮食和工业原料作物，否则，不仅农业生产要受很大影响，其他生产建设事业也必将不能很快发展。
    在农村，总的主攻方向是农业生产，在这方面应该集结最多的劳动力。要按照以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，按比例地配备田间生产队和各种专业队的人力；还要适应不同时期的具体情况，组织大协作，有时支援田间生产，有时突击其它生产。其它事业占用的劳动力，不仅必须控制在一定的比例以内，并且要尽可能根据“一专多能”的原则，在农忙时参加农业生产，农闲时参加公社工业或其它事业。从事农村文教事业、集体福利事业的人员，凡是能够不脱离农业生产的，就坚决不要脱离农业生产。事实非常明显，凡是劳动力平均分散使用或者轻重倒置的地区和单位，由于农业这个基础不牢固，粮食这条纲没有提起来，其它各项工作也就大受影响。凡是正确地按照以农业为基础和以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针部署战斗力量的地区和单位，农业生产搞得好，其它各业都是一派兴旺气象，各项工作都很主动。
    对党的政策方针认识清楚之后，要确保贯彻执行政策方针，最要紧的事情就是调查研究实际情况。广东省委调查研究了全省城乡劳动力情况之后，除了坚决把某些企业过多占用的劳动力调回农村以外，还正确地规定了在粮食生产方面、多种经营方面、工业交通方面、福利事业方面劳动力的分配比例，对学生、干部参加生产的办法也作了规定。这样，全省就可以动员一百万人回到生产队去加强田间作业。江苏昆山正仪人民公社中稻插秧至少需要两千二百多个插秧手，开始插秧的时候下田的却只有一千一百多个，不能保证及时插好秧。是不是不可能抽调更多的劳动力来插秧呢？县委第一书记姜元文和县委书记姜振中到田里、猪场、食堂、副业队、排灌工程工地等等场所，同基层干部和群众一起作了调查研究，发现从改进作业方法、合理安排人力、调整工作日程等方面可以挖出大量的劳动力。调整的结果，这个公社参加中稻插秧的人数增加到三千三百多人，插秧工作比原计划提前五天完成。这样做，会不会只顾田间、丢掉其他呢？不会的。关键在于：精打细算，合理安排，提高技术，改进工具。有许多农村食堂和社办工业、副业人员减少了一半左右，办得同过去一样好，主要原因是进行了工具改革。可以用弱劳力的工作就不用强劳力，一人能兼几种工作的就兼做几种工作，凡是可缓办的事情就坚决缓办，能紧缩机构的就坚决紧缩，从这些方面精心安排，都能节约不少劳动力。这样做，其他工作并不会丢掉，而是按照它们本来应占的位置放在第二位、第三位。这些第二位、第三位的工作，也应该围绕着第一位的工作，为第一位的工作服务。
    在安排各级经济和各个生产项目所需要的劳动力的时候，不能只看数量。在农业生产上不只要在第一线集中较多的劳动力，而且要集中一定数量的精壮劳动力。要做到这一点，每个地区每个公社的领导者必须到第一线去，清清楚楚地看看实际情况，切切实实地采取一些措施。除了按照整个战略部署调兵遣将之外，还要不断地加强政治工作，健全和改进劳动组织和劳动管理，使每个劳动力都能充分地发挥作用。
    整个经济建设的形势是很好的，公社社员群众的干劲是很高的，只要每个地区每个人民公社都把主要的劳动力集中在农业生产第一线，并且正确地组织、合理地使用，就一定能取得农业战线的更大的胜利，并且更好地发挥农业的基础作用，促使整个社会主义建设更快地前进。
