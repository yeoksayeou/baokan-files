    Tank Soldiers and Tractor Station
    Zhuang Tao
    Zhang Heqing, the director of a tractor station in Zhejiang Province, said, "Our tractor station grew up with the direct help of the People's Liberation Army's tank unit. Our tractor drivers, like chickens laying eggs and eggs hatching chickens, have grown up batch after batch, but the root is in the military unit." Now, this tractor station has grown from seven tractors when it was established last spring to sixty-seven, and the number of tractor drivers has grown from the initial twenty-three to more than one hundred and ten.
    When this tractor station announced its establishment last spring, seven tractors arrived, and the commune members were overjoyed. Following this, a tank unit of the People's Liberation Army decided to vigorously support this newly established tractor station. They immediately sent Liang Baozhen, the technical section chief, leading six technicians, tank drivers, repairmen, and electricians to work at the tractor station, determined to train a group of tractor drivers before the spring plowing.
    After the tank soldiers arrived at the tractor station, they started a tractor driver training class. In the teaching process, they overcame many difficulties. Lacking teaching materials, they wrote their own; lacking teaching experience, everyone researched together; the students' cultural level was not high, so they taught while demonstrating, patiently guiding them. When learning about the circuit system, the students couldn't "chew" it for a while, and some became discouraged. Liang Baozhen told them stories of new soldiers overcoming difficulties in learning to drive tanks, which boosted their confidence in overcoming difficulties. Once, a female student, Zheng Juhua, accidentally drove the tractor into a ditch, and she was so anxious that she cried. The "teacher" encouraged her and helped her summarize the experience and lessons learned, enabling her to quickly master driving skills. After more than twenty days of training, the students learned general mechanical principles and operating techniques. After assessment, three students obtained third-level driver's licenses, and other students could also operate in general situations.
    After the training class, this tank unit sent cadres to help the tractor station establish a complete set of management, maintenance, and vehicle maintenance systems. Liang Baozhen, the technical section chief, also used the method of taking on apprentices to pass on organizational leadership experience to the cadres of the tractor station. When the plowing season arrived, this unit sent tank soldiers to the site to guide tractor operation. After that, this tank unit helped the tractor station even more. When the tractor needed a medium repair, the tractor station drove the tractor into the tank unit's repair shop. When the tractor needed a minor repair, as long as a phone call was made, the unit's technicians would carry their tools over. Sometimes, long after the lights-out bugle had sounded, the tractor station would send over parts that needed urgent repair, and the tank soldiers would always get out of bed and rush to repair them overnight. Once, the tractor station sent sixty-four new batteries, requesting them to be charged within five days. Charging squad leader Shan Qidao said, "The work of the tractor station is our work; we can't delay the station's production tasks!" He took two charging workers and charged these batteries on schedule.
    Now, the relationship between this tractor station and the tank unit is even closer. The tractor station always reports good news to the tank unit when it achieves new results, and the tractor drivers go to the tank unit "to visit their maternal home" whenever they have time. They said, "We will never forget the warm support of the People's Liberation Army for us."

### 坦克兵和拖拉机站

    坦克兵和拖拉机站
    庄涛
    浙江省的一个拖拉机站站长张和清说：“我们的拖拉机站是在解放军坦克部队直接帮助下成长起来的，我们的拖拉机手像鸡生蛋，蛋生鸡一样，一批批地成长起来，可是根子在部队。”现在，这个拖拉机站从去年春天成立时的七台发展到六十七台，拖拉机手从最初的二十三名发展到一百一十多名。
    去年春天，这个拖拉机站宣布成立的时候，开来了七部拖拉机，社员们喜得心花怒放。接着，人民解放军某坦克部队决定大力支援这个新生的拖拉机站。他们当即派技术处长梁宝箴带领技师、坦克驾驶员、修理工和电工等六人到拖拉机站去工作，决定在春耕前培养出一批拖拉机手。
    坦克兵到拖拉机站后，就举办了拖拉机手训练班。在教学过程中，他们克服了许多困难。缺乏教材，他们自己动手编写；缺乏教学经验，大家共同研究；学员文化水平不高，他们就边讲边做，耐心地把着手教。学电路系统时，学员们一时“啃”不动，有些人有点泄气，梁宝箴就给他们讲新战士学习开坦克克服困难的故事，使他们鼓起了克服困难的信心。有一次，女学员郑菊花不小心把拖拉机开到沟里去了，急得直哭。“老师”一面鼓励她，一面帮助她总结经验教训，使她很快地掌握了驾驶技术。经过二十多天的训练，学员们都学会了一般机械原理和操作技术。经考核，三名学员取得了三级驾驶员执照，其它学员也能在一般情况下操作。
    训练班结束后，这支坦克部队又派来干部，帮助拖拉机站建立起一整套管理、保养和维护车辆的制度。技术处长梁宝箴还用带徒弟的方法，向拖拉机站的干部传授组织领导的经验。到了耕种季节，这支部队又派来坦克兵到现场指导拖拉机操作。在这以后，这支坦克部队帮助拖拉机站的活动就更多了。拖拉机需要中修，拖拉机站就把拖拉机开进坦克部队的修理车间。拖拉机需要小修，只要一个电话，部队的技工就背起工具来了。有时熄灯号吹过好久，拖拉机站送来需要急修的机件，坦克兵总是从床上爬起来连夜赶修。有一次，拖拉机站送来了六十四个新电瓶，请求在五天中替他们充好。充电班长单其道说：“拖拉机站的工作就是我们的工作，不能耽误站上的生产任务！”他带着两个充电工，按期把这些电瓶充满了电。
    现在，这个拖拉机站和坦克部队关系更加亲密。拖拉机站一出现新成绩总要向坦克兵部队报喜，拖拉机手一有空就去坦克兵部队“走娘家”。他们说：“我们永远忘不了解放军对我们的热情支援。”
