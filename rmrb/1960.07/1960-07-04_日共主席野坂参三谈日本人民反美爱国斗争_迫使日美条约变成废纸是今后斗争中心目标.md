Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd dispatch: Nozaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement today in "Akahata" newspaper, providing an important analysis of the Japanese people's just anti-American patriotic struggle. He pointed out that the central goal of the Japanese people's struggle moving forward must be to strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty."

Nozaka emphasized that the Japanese democratic forces have already dealt the enemy – the U.S.-Japan reactionaries – their heaviest blow since the war. The democratic forces have thereby enhanced their political awareness, united firmly, demonstrated a high degree of combat effectiveness, and achieved great success. Nozaka pointed out: In this respect, the Japanese people's struggle this time is of historical significance.

He said that due to increased political awareness, the Japanese people have seen through the aggressive essence of the new "Security Treaty," which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, and recognized the two enemies of the Japanese people – U.S. imperialism and Japanese traitorous reactionary monopoly capital and its agents, the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

Nozaka said that the huge wave of people's anger thwarted Eisenhower's visit to Japan and disrupted the U.S. plot to establish a military alliance in Northeast Asia. This victory made a great contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia. Domestically, we drove a wedge into the Liberal Democratic Party and forced Kishi Nobusuke to announce his resignation.

Nozaka pointed out that in this struggle, the workers stood at the forefront and united the broad masses of people to participate in unified action. Democratic forces centered on the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and Sōhyō (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) established more than two thousand joint struggle organizations throughout the country; millions of people participated in rallies and strikes in each unified action; and more than twenty million people signed petitions opposing the new "Security Treaty." All of this has laid a good foundation for the development of future struggles, and at the same time, it means that the seeds of a national democratic united front have appeared on Japanese soil.

Nozaka emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance has been encouraged and supported by the people of China, Korea, and Vietnam, who are waging struggles against U.S. imperialism. Therefore, it has strengthened the common struggle of the Asian people against U.S. imperialism.

Nozaka stressed that the goal of future struggles must be to strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty."

He said that the new "Security Treaty," the "Administrative Agreement," and the relevant domestic laws for implementing this treaty are all invalid. We must unremittingly launch struggles in the future to abolish military bases, demand the abolition of armaments, demand the cancellation of military expenditures, and increase social insurance expenses, and through these struggles, force the new "Security Treaty" to become effectively useless.

Nozaka pointed out that at the same time, struggles must be launched to demand the withdrawal of U-2 aircraft, strive for the return of Okinawa, strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and North Korea, and conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty. These struggles are all struggles to strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty."

Nozaka pointed out that the ruling classes of the United States and Japan are plotting to use the tactics they played in South Korea, first forcing Kishi Nobusuke to take all the responsibility and step down, and then creating a "second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet."

Nozaka said that the Japanese people will not allow a second or third Kishi Nobusuke cabinet wearing a mask to come to power.

He emphasized that after the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, a caretaker cabinet must be established, organized by political forces, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, and other opposition parties, that have no stain on the "Security Treaty" issue.

    日共主席野坂参三谈日本人民反美爱国斗争
    迫使日美条约变成废纸是今后斗争中心目标
    日本民主力量已给美日反动派以沉重打击；在斗争中出现了民族民主统一战线的萌芽；为了废除“安全条约”，必须进行一系列斗争；岸信介下台后应由没有政治污点的政治力量组织看守内阁。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，对日本人民反美爱国正义斗争作了重要的分析。他指出，日本人民今后斗争的中心目标必须是争取废除新“安全条约”。
    野坂强调指出，日本民主力量已给予敌人——美日反动派战后以来最沉重的打击。民主力量从而提高了政治觉悟，坚决团结起来，发挥了高度的战斗性，获得了巨大成就。野坂指出：在这一点上，日本人民这次斗争是具有历史意义的。
    他说，日本人民由于提高了政治觉悟，看透了新“安全条约”以中苏为敌的侵略本质，认清了日本人民的两个敌人——美帝国主义和日本卖国反动垄断资本与它的代理人岸信介政府和自由民主党。
    野坂说，人民愤怒的巨浪挫败了艾森豪威尔访日计划，打乱了美国建立东北亚军事同盟的阴谋。这次胜利对维护亚洲和平作出了巨大贡献。在国内，我们给自由民主党内部打下了楔子，迫使岸信介不得不宣布下台。
    野坂指出，在这次斗争中，工人站在前列，并且团结了广大人民参加统一行动。以共产党、社会党和“总评”为中心的民主力量在全国建立了两千多个共同斗争组织；在每次统一行动中有几百万人民参加了集会和罢工；有两千多万人签名表示反对新“安全条约”。这一切都为今后斗争的发展打好了基础，同时这意味着在日本的土地上已经出现了民族民主统一战线的萌芽。
    野坂强调说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争，受到了正在同美帝国主义展开斗争的中国、朝鲜、越南人民的鼓励和支援。因此，加强了亚洲人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争。
    野坂强调指出，今后的斗争目标必须是争取废除新“安全条约”。
    他说，新“安全条约”和“行政协定”以及为实行这个条约的有关国内法律都是无效的。我们今后必须不懈地展开斗争，争取撤销军事基地，要求废除军备，要求取消军事开支，增加社会保险费用，通过这些斗争迫使新“安全条约”事实上变成没有用的东西。
    野坂指出，与此同时，必须展开斗争，要求撤走U—2型飞机，争取收回冲绳岛、争取恢复日中、日朝邦交和缔结日苏和约。这些斗争都是为争取废除“安全条约”的斗争。
    野坂指出，美日两国统治阶级正在阴谋使用在南朝鲜玩弄过的手法，先迫使岸信介承担一切责任下台，然后制造“第二个岸信介内阁”。
    野坂说，日本人民不许带上假面具的第二个、第三个岸信介内阁上台。
    他强调说，在岸信介内阁垮台后必须建立由包括共产党、社会党、民主社会党等在野派在内的在“安全条约”问题上没有污点的政治力量来组织看守内阁。
