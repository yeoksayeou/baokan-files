Serving Large Industries, Serving Agricultural Production, Serving the People's Livelihood
Nanjing's Street Industries Become an Emerging Social Productive Force
Chongqing's Shangxin Street Commune Adopts a Method of Developing and Rectifying Simultaneously to Consolidate Commune-Run Industries

    (Our reporter Gu Ping reports) Nanjing's street industries, scattered throughout the city's streets and alleys, are developing and advancing along the correct path by adapting to the characteristics of urban production and life, and by suiting measures to local conditions, people, and times. They are increasingly playing a significant role in serving the economic lives of urban and rural people, serving large industries, and serving agriculture. Currently, the nine communes and twenty-four sub-communes in Nanjing's urban districts have nearly three thousand street production units, including nine hundred and sixty-nine street factories, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two production groups, ninety-three transportation teams, and one hundred and twelve construction teams. More than 100,000 residents participate in production, with housewives accounting for about 80%. From January to May this year, the total output value and processing fees of street industries were more than three times the total output value and processing fees of the entire last year.
    In order to adapt to the characteristics of small commodity production and to facilitate the participation of semi-able-bodied labor in production, production organizations are both centralized and decentralized; some work all day, while others work several hours a day. To improve the output and quality of small commodity production, many communes and sub-communes have also established specialized small commodity production bases classified by small hardware, small commodities, cultural and health supplies, etc. They form a fixed collaboration network with large factories as the backbone, sharing resources and fully utilizing the potential of each factory. The number of small commodities produced has reached more than two thousand eight hundred, and the output has also increased significantly.
    More than 40% of the city's street industries directly serve large industries. They have established relatively fixed processing relationships with large factories, with the large factories supplying raw materials or utilizing their waste materials to produce various parts and components for the large factories. Communes and sub-communes also adopt the approach of serving whichever factory is nearby and producing whatever raw materials are available, developing comprehensively while focusing on specific areas. The Xuanwu Commune and Gulou Commune are located in areas with relatively developed radio and mechanical industries, so the street industries mainly developed the processing industries of telecommunications instruments and mechanical industries. The Xuanwu Commune has thirty-three production units serving the telecommunications instrument industry, with nearly two thousand people; twenty-five units serving the mechanical industry, with one thousand eight hundred people. They produce and process more than one hundred types of products such as loudspeakers, transmitters, and plastics for forty-five large factories.
    Street factories always proactively assist large factories with whatever help they need and are capable of providing. For some large factories whose parts production needs to be done internally, street factories dispatch entire workshops to provide on-site processing services. In the past, the state-owned Jinling Shipyard had a large workload in knocking off rust and painting ships. It took more than half a month to knock off the rust of one ship. The Xiaguan Commune established a rust removal factory specifically to remove rust for the Jinling Shipyard, freeing up the Jinling Shipyard's workers to devote themselves to more important production.
    Street industries have also achieved certain results in serving agricultural production. More than a dozen factories in the Xuanwu Commune process and repair agricultural and water conservancy machinery and equipment such as diesel engines, sluice gates, and tractor tires for rural areas, and also produce more than forty types of small farm tools such as nail rakes and sickles. The Dongfeng Electric Motor Factory's 60% of business is overhauling water pumps and sprayers for rural people's communes. While producing industrial products and daily necessities, the Xinguang Hardware Factory in the Xiaguan Commune also arranges some of its workforce to produce small farm tools such as buckets, sickles, iron shovels, and hoes to support rural areas. The feed factory specializes in producing various feeds for three counties in the city and is very popular in rural areas.
    Nanjing's street industries, by correctly implementing the policy of serving the people's lives, serving large industries, and serving agriculture, have met the diverse needs of the broad masses of people and created a large amount of wealth for society. Currently, the output value of street industries accounts for about 20% of the city's total industrial output value, becoming an emerging and important social productive force. The production of small commodities that are essential to people's lives but are temporarily neglected by large industries is now mostly undertaken by street industries, which plays an important role in "filling gaps and making up for deficiencies." Small hardware, small commodities, and other daily necessities come in a wide variety of styles, are scattered, and have large quantities. Production by street industries can not only fully utilize waste materials but also facilitate the full utilization of various types of semi-able-bodied labor in the city, which is of great benefit to the entire social production. After street industries undertake many auxiliary productions of large factories, not only is the cost of products reduced, allowing large factories to free up their workforce to produce more high-precision products, but also a large number of technical reserve forces are cultivated for large factories. The city's street industries have successively transferred more than 60,000 people to state-owned and local state-owned factories and mining enterprises.
    In the process of serving the three areas, the production, supply, and sales of street industries are all incorporated into the plans of state-owned industrial and commercial departments, which makes the development of street industries more consolidated and sound.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th) The Shangxin Street People's Commune in Chongqing has adopted the method of developing and rectifying simultaneously, making commune-run industries increasingly consolidated.
    The Shangxin Street People's Commune was established only in March of this year. In the month or so after its establishment, the number of commune-run factories developed to ninety-one. In order to continuously consolidate and develop these commune-run factories, the commune recently conducted a rectification of commune-run industries. After rectification, the commune currently has thirty-seven factories. These factories all completed their production plans ahead of schedule in June, and the variety of products also increased from sixty before the rectification to more than one hundred. All the commune's factories have signed fifty-seven production and sales contracts with state-owned factories and commercial departments, with a total of thirty-three varieties and a product output value of more than 10 million yuan, making the production of commune-run factories incorporated into the national plan to a considerable extent.
    Most of the small factories established when the commune was established had dispersed production, lacked management systems, and the production of some factories was not entirely in line with social needs, or the source of raw materials was relatively difficult. The products of some factories were urgently needed by the market, but they were unable to rapidly expand production due to poor equipment and technical strength. The commune party committee, in response to these problems, ranked all the factories in the commune and comprehensively arranged the production plans of these factories. Factories such as weaving factories, yarn winding factories, and embroidery factories, which used cotton cloth and cotton yarn as their main raw materials, could not immediately expand production because the raw materials were allocated by the state according to plan, so these factories were stabilized at their original production scale, focusing on improving product quality and increasing the variety of products. The commune also merged more than twenty shoe sole factories, cloth shell factories, and shoe buckle factories run by residents into three labor protection product factories to facilitate leadership and management. Some factories that should be actively developed due to production and market needs have expanded production during the rectification. The original electrical appliance repair factory and flat car repair factory had very few workers and insufficient technical strength. After the commune merged these two factories, the number of workers more than doubled, and the technical strength was also greatly strengthened.
    In adjusting commune-run industries, the commune paid attention to the rational use of various types of labor force, and assigned some light labor to semi-able-bodied workers in the commune as much as possible. In this way, more than two hundred able-bodied laborers were transferred, and a new batch of factories was established specifically to serve nearby state-owned factories. For example, with the assistance of the state-owned Xinmin Plastic Factory, the commune recently established a factory specializing in producing press plates, adhesives, and other products for the Xinmin Plastic Factory, freeing up a batch of labor from the Xinmin Plastic Factory to produce other products.

    为大工业服务　为农业生产服务　为人民生活服务
    南京街道工业成为新兴的社会生产力量
    重庆上新街公社采取边发展边整顿办法巩固社办工业
    本报讯　记者古平报道：遍布南京市大街小巷的街道工业，由于根据城市生产和生活的特点，因地因人因时制宜地循着正确的轨道发展前进。它在为城乡人民经济生活服务、为大工业服务以及为农业服务等方面，日益发挥着巨大作用。目前，南京全市城区九个公社的二十四个分社中，街道生产单位近三千个，其中街道工厂九百六十九个，生产组一千七百八十二个，交通运输队九十三个，建筑队一百一十二个。参加生产的居民有十万多人，其中家庭妇女占80％左右。今年1月至5月街道工业总产值和加工费等于去年全年总产值和加工费的三倍多。
    为了适应小商品生产的特点，便于吸收半劳动力参加生产，生产组织有集中的，也有分散的；有整天劳动的，也有一天劳动几小时的。在提高小商品生产的产量和质量方面，很多公社和分社还按小五金、小百货、文化卫生用品等分类建立专业的小商品生产基地。他们之间以大厂为骨干，组成一个固定的协作片；互通有无，充分发挥了各厂的潜力。生产的小商品达到二千八百多种，产量也有很大增长。
    全市直接为大工业服务的街道工业占40％多。他们和大厂建立了比较固定的加工关系，由大厂供给原材料或利用大厂的边废料，为大厂生产各种零件、部件。各公社和分社还采取靠近什么厂就为什么厂服务，有什么原材料就生产什么的办法，既全面发展，又各有所侧重。玄武公社和古楼公社所在地区无线电和机械工业比较发达，街道工业就主要发展了电讯仪表和机械工业的加工工业。玄武公社为电讯仪表工业服务的生产单位就有三十三个，近二千人；为机械工业服务的单位二十五个，一千八百人。他们为四十五个大厂生产加工扬声器、传授器、塑胶等一百多种产品。
    大工厂需要什么帮助，只要是力所能及的，街道工厂总是主动地去当助手。有些大厂的配件生产需要在内部进行，街道工厂就派出整个车间上门加工服务。国营金陵船厂过去敲船锈和油漆船只的工程很大，敲一只船的铁锈要半个多月。下关公社就办了一个除锈厂专门为金陵船厂除锈，使金陵船厂的工人腾出手来投入更重要的生产。
    街道工业为农业生产服务方面，也取得了一定的成绩。玄武公社有十多个厂为农村加工、修理柴油机、水闸闸门、拖拉机轮胎等农业、水利机械设备，还生产钉钯、镰刀等四十多种小农具。东风电机厂60％的业务为农村人民公社整修抽水机、喷雾器等。下关公社新光五金厂，在生产工业用品和日用百货的同时，还安排一部分力量生产水桶、镰刀、铁锹、锄头等小农具支援农村。饲料厂专门为全市三个县生产各种饲料，深受农村欢迎。
    南京市街道工业由于正确地贯彻了为人民生活、为大工业、为农业服务的方针，满足了广大人民多方面的需要，为社会创造了大量财富。现在街道工业的产值占全市工业总产值的20％左右，成为一种新兴的重要的社会生产力量。大工业一时顾不上，管不了，但却是人民生活中必不可少的小商品生产，现在大部分是由街道工业承担了，这就起了一个重要的“拾遗补缺”的作用。小五金、小百货等生活用品花色繁多，零零星星，数量很大，由街道工业生产，既可充分利用废弃材料，又便于充分利用城市各种各样的半劳力，对整个社会生产有很大好处。大工厂的许多辅助性生产由街道工业承担后，不但降低了产品成本，使大厂能够腾出手来生产更多的高精尖产品，也为大厂培养了大批技术后备力量。全市街道工业先后输送了六万多人到国营、地方国营厂矿企业工作。
    街道工业在为三方面服务中，产供销全部纳入了国营工业和商业部门的计划，这就使街道工业更加巩固和健全的发展。
    据新华社重庆11日电　重庆上新街人民公社采取边发展、边整顿的办法，使社办工业日益巩固。
    上新街人民公社是今年3月才建立的。建社后一个多月，社办工厂就发展到九十一个，为了使这些社办工厂不断巩固和发展，公社最近对社办工业进行了一次整顿。经过整顿后，全社现有工厂三十七个。这些工厂6月份都提前超额完成了生产计划，产品的花色品种也由整顿前的六十种增加到一百多种。全社工厂与国营工厂、商业部门签订了产销合同五十七份，共有三十三个品种、一千多万元产值的产品，使社办工厂的生产在相当程度上纳入了国家计划。
    公社成立时办起来的一批小工厂多数生产分散，缺乏管理制度，有些厂的生产不尽切合社会需要，或者原料材料来源比较困难。有些厂的产品是市场迫切需要的，但是因为设备、技术力量差等原因没有能迅速扩大生产。公社党委就针对这些问题，对全社工厂进行了排队，全面安排了这些厂的生产计划。以棉布、棉纱作主要原料的织造厂、络纱厂、挑花厂等工厂，因原料都是国家有计划投放的，生产不能马上扩大，就使这些厂稳定在原有的生产规模上，集中力量提高产品质量和增加花色品种。公社还把居民们举办的二十多个纳鞋底厂、布壳厂、鞋扣厂等合并成为三个劳动保护用品厂以便于领导管理。一些因生产和市场需要应积极发展的工厂，在整顿中都扩大了生产。原来的一个电器修理厂和一个平车修理厂，工人都很少，技术力量不足，公社把这两个厂合并后，工人增加了一倍多，技术力量也大大加强。
    在调整社办工业中，公社注意了各类劳动力的合理使用，把一些轻便劳动尽可能分配给社员中的半劳动力担任。这样就抽调出了二百多名全劳动力，又新办了一批工厂，专门为附近的国营工厂服务。如公社最近在国营新民塑料厂的协助下，举办了一家工厂专为新民塑料厂生产压板、粘合剂等产品，使新民塑料厂腾出一批劳动力去生产其他产品。（附图片）
