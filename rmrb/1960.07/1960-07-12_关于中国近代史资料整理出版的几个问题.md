Several Questions Regarding the Compilation and Publication of Materials on Modern Chinese History
　　Zhonghua Book Company Modern History Editorial Group

　　In the nearly eighty years from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement, Chinese society experienced extremely profound changes, and national and class contradictions were very sharp. The historical materials left behind by this tortuous and complex historical journey are very rich in content and vast in quantity. As early as 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward to us the task of studying China's modern history of nearly a hundred years since the Opium War, and at the same time clearly pointed out the direction and method for carrying out this research work. He said: "For the history of China in the past century, we should gather talents and cooperate to do it, and overcome the state of disorganization. We should first conduct analytical research in several departments such as economic history, political history, military history, and cultural history, and then it will be possible to conduct comprehensive research." ("Reform Our Study") To this day, Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant instructions on studying China's modern history of the past century still retain their extremely important guiding significance.
    We know that the purpose of studying modern Chinese history is to scientifically summarize the historical development from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement, and to explain the laws of class struggle and social development in modern Chinese society, so as to make this research help guide the current great movement. The compilation and publication of modern history materials should also revolve around this purpose, providing rich and specific materials from all aspects, so that researchers can possess a large amount of material to more fully, comprehensively, and deeply demonstrate and explain the laws of class struggle and social development in modern Chinese society.
    The materials on modern Chinese history are extremely vast and complex. Even excluding the documents and archives of imperialist invasion agencies in China and the writings and records of imperialist elements, the initial estimate of its quantity is probably no less than several billion or even tens of billions of words. Under the reactionary rule before liberation, it was impossible to carry out planned sorting of these vast and complex historical materials. After the national liberation, the research of modern history and the sorting of historical materials took on a new look. Under the correct leadership and close care of the Party, thanks to the active efforts of historical researchers, educators, and relevant editors and publishers, the compilation and publication of modern Chinese historical materials has achieved considerable success. According to extremely incomplete statistics, from 1949 to 1959, about two hundred kinds of materials related to modern Chinese history were published nationwide. Some of these historical materials not only have high historical value, but also have a high scientific level in terms of sorting methods. The sorting and publication of these historical materials has undoubtedly enriched the content of modern Chinese history research and provided many convenient conditions for researchers and teachers.
    However, the compilation and publication of modern history materials is still far from meeting the growing practical needs. In order to better serve historical research and teaching, we feel that the following issues need to be resolved. Adhere to putting politics in command and eliminate bourgeois ideology.
    First, the compilation and publication of modern history materials is an indispensable part of the ideological front and the field of scientific research. To do this work well, we must first adhere to putting politics in command, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly overcome the erroneous view that compiling and publishing historical materials can be divorced from politics and ideological struggle. Facts have proved that in the compilation and publication of historical materials, there is a struggle between the two roads and two ideologies of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. For example, in the attitude towards historical materials, some people do not ask for actual needs, do not look at the value of historical materials, but seek historical materials for the sake of historical materials, and sort them for the sake of sorting, and even in order to hunt for novelty, they pursue so-called "rare secret books" without selection. Some people do not analyze historical materials from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, but replace historical scientific research with the sorting of historical materials. They sort out historical materials not to serve the politics of the proletariat, to serve socialist scientific research and teaching, but to regard it as their own personal "famous mountain career." As for the phenomenon of holding and monopolizing historical materials, it has not been completely eliminated. In connection with this wrong thinking, the method of sorting historical materials is to collect everything without selection, including useful and useless things, and even in the preface or postscript, to praise and extol the ancients and ancient books that are only used as materials, or to make some tedious textual criticisms that are completely unnecessary. All these are actually reflections of bourgeois academic thought in the work of sorting historical materials. There is no doubt that such bourgeois ideological viewpoints should be criticized and overcome. However, we should also see that even these few people who hold bourgeois academic views, as long as they truly obey the leadership of the Party, truly want to serve the people, truly want to study Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and consciously transform their thinking, then they can gradually overcome bourgeois ideological viewpoints in practice and establish a proletarian worldview, thereby making useful contributions to the people in the work of sorting materials. In fact, many of them are already working in this direction and have achieved good results.
    In addition, there are also some people who lack due attention to the work of sorting materials, and even regard it as an dispensable and insignificant work. Some people also regard sorting materials as an extra burden. They believe that sorting historical materials is nothing more than tedious technical work, or at least that sorting materials does not count as scientific research. We believe that this is an incorrect point of view. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always taught us that when studying problems, we must first possess a large amount of sufficient material, and we must adhere to the unity of viewpoint and material. A person who truly engages in scientific research with a realistic attitude must attach great importance to the accumulation and research of
  data. In the face of science, it is impossible to take shortcuts and
  find shortcuts. If we truly resolve to seize the scientific fortress,
  and truly want to figure out one thing after another in the scientific field,
  then without hard work, without possessing a large amount of material, without
  doing a lot of cleaning and analysis of these large amounts of material,
  it is impossible to achieve the goal. In fact, truly valuable materials that have been carefully
  researched and sorted out must be the result of arduous scientific research.
  Of course, there should be some division of labor in practical work. For example, some
  people focus on modern history research and education, while others focus
  mainly on sorting historical materials. This division of labor starts from the needs of the entire socialist
  construction cause, and there is absolutely no so-called "high or low"
  distinction. The idea of ​​underestimating the sorting of materials must be opposed.
      We sort and publish historical materials in order to provide
  convenient conditions for scientific research, to critically inherit the heritage, and to provide the necessary conditions for the development and prosperity of socialist
  scientific culture. We must not only oppose all kinds of
  bourgeois viewpoints, but also give due importance to data work,
  so that it can develop normally and healthily under correct ideological guidance.
        Strengthen planning and rationally organize forces
    Second, in recent years, although the planning of the compilation and publication of modern history materials has been gradually strengthened, it still seems very insufficient. On the one hand, some of the published materials on modern history not only seem fragmented and lack systematicness, but also have an imbalance. For example, more historical materials on political history and economic history have been published, while very few have been published on cultural history and military history; more historical materials related to the climax of revolutionary struggles and anti-aggression wars have been published (this is absolutely necessary), while too few historical materials related to the temporary low tide of struggles or the gap periods between the two wars have been published; some of the works of certain representative figures in modern times have been published more, while others have been published very little or not at all; especially historical materials that were neglected by bourgeois scholars in the past but are more important for our research on modern history and have important reference value, such as historical materials of ethnic minorities, survey data of modern revolutionary struggles, have not been compiled and published much, and so on. On the other hand, there is not enough mutual connection, division of labor and cooperation between scientific research institutions and universities, so the phenomenon of mutual repetition and intersection often occurs in the work. For example, some historical materials that do not need to be repeatedly sorted out
  (such as collecting economic data from the Ming and Qing Dynasties' records, collecting currency data from archives and Qing people's collections, compiling indexes of modern history papers, etc.) are carried out by two or more academic groups at the same time, while some historical materials or necessary reference books that urgently need to be sorted out have not been started.
    Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a more comprehensive and feasible compilation and publication plan according to the needs and possible conditions of research work and teaching work. And in order to make this plan as practical and easy to implement as possible, on the one hand, it is necessary to conduct a preliminary investigation of the existing historical materials in order to distinguish between the priorities; on the other hand, under unified planning, it is necessary to better organize forces, divide labor and cooperate.
      Continue to improve quality and oppose the one-sided pursuit of quantity
    Third, the quality of the compilation and publication of historical materials needs to be further improved. Judging from the current situation of some modern history materials that have been published, there are indeed many with good or better quality, but the quality of many historical materials is still not satisfactory. We believe that the quality of historical materials books depends on two aspects: one is the reference value of the historical materials themselves, and the other is whether the position and viewpoint of the compilers and publishers are correct and the degree of processing. At present, we often see such a situation, that is, the compilation and publication of some materials lacks clear purpose, making it impossible to see what problems in historical scientific research and teaching these materials are intended to solve; some materials are published in fragments and lack systematicness; and some materials that originally have high value, but due to the compiler's incorrect viewpoint, unclear banner, or poor processing and sorting, the quality of the materials is seriously affected. For example, for some relatively large historical materials originally written by the reactionary ruling class, the preface and description in the editing and publishing do not make specific scientific analysis of their content, historical background, and reference value; for some materials that should be summarized or added with notes, the attitude of the editor and compiler is not expressed. In terms of sorting methods and processing degrees, some historical materials books are made rough and messy. For example, for some materials with more content, no content-prompting titles are added; for some materials that can be appropriately classified and arranged, no classification is added; for some materials that can be selected and edited, no selection or deletion is made, and useful things and fundamentally useless things are printed as they are, without any selection; for some materials that should be attached with necessary indexes, no indexes are added; some nouns that should be annotated are not annotated; the textual criticism and verification of some historical materials are not accurate. This brings many inconveniences to the users of historical materials, and even forces them to browse the entire book in order to use a historical material. This will inevitably reduce the reference and use value of the historical materials.
    We believe that in order to improve the quality of the compilation and publication of modern history materials, there must be a clear purpose, and we must "have what we need", rather than "publish what we have". That is to say, the compilation and publication of modern history materials must closely cooperate with the needs of research work and teaching work, and give priority to publishing books with higher historical value, greater reference value, and less circulation, and
  conduct more detailed sorting and processing, and strive to make it easy to use. In front of the book
  there should be a preface or publication
  description written from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, necessary
  explanation of the publication purpose, historical value, and historical background, the political attitude of the author (compiler), as well as the source of historical materials and sorting method
  description; for some historical materials, especially materials for the use of the vast number of young researchers and educators
  data, we should also use the Marxist-Leninist view
  to make necessary analysis and criticism in the preface, and make appropriate descriptions of some historical material content, and make
  clear and correct annotations on some obscure terms and difficult words and sentences; for data that are inconvenient to look up, necessary
  indexes should be attached. No matter what kind of data, the textual criticism and the source of quotations
  must be accurate. To fight for quality is the primary task of the current and future
  modern history material compilation and publication work. The quality of the material compilation and
  publication work is mainly judged by whether the quality is good, not by
  the quantity. The one-sided pursuit of quantity and neglect of quality is actually
  sorting for the sake of sorting and publishing for the sake of publishing, which is a manifestation of being divorced from politics, reality, and the masses.
  We must overcome the thinking of "better to have than not, more
  than less, and the more the better", overcome the attitude of treating data with the method of "file keepers saving old paper", and insist on
  carrying out the compilation and publication work with purpose, selection, and planning under the condition of putting proletarian
  politics in command.
      Of course, when we emphasize the purposeful, selective, and planned
  compilation and publication of historical data, we never mean that we can arbitrarily delete
  data, let alone tamper with historical data at will. On the contrary, we believe that
  all data that have reference value, even if they are negative data with reactionary content,
  as long as they are really useful for studying historical issues, and we have made necessary explanations in the preface, notes, or annotations, then we should maintain its original appearance, and take effective measures to distribute these materials to readers who really need them, so as to facilitate the use of researchers and educators, and use negative data to write positive articles.
  Take effective measures to strengthen the editing and publishing of reference books
    Fourth, since the modern Chinese history materials are so vast, in order to facilitate reference and use, we must use various necessary reference books. Although reference books are not within the scope of historical materials in terms of their nature, they are directly and closely related to the sorting and use of materials. Therefore, it is necessary to raise this issue for discussion. It should be said that there is a great lack of reference books on modern Chinese history, which can be said to be a weak link in the current publication of modern history books. With the increasing development of modern history research, especially with the rapid growth of a large number of new forces, the need for reference books is very urgent for both research work and teaching work. It can be imagined that if a batch of accurate and practical reference books are really edited, how much convenience it will bring to researchers and teachers, and how much time it will save them from looking up historical materials. Therefore, it is very necessary to quickly take effective measures to strengthen this work.
    Because of different target readers, their requirements for reference books are also different. However, for all types of readers, the following types of reference books are essential: 1. Comprehensive and specialized, detailed and concise historical dictionaries; 2. Comprehensive and specialized, detailed and concise chronologies, chronicles, and historical maps, etc.; 3. Various indexes and reference book summaries. In order to meet the urgent needs of readers, we believe that the editing and publishing of reference books should currently be one of the focuses of the compilation and publication of modern history materials, and should be vigorously carried out.
        Launch a mass movement and promote the style of cooperation
    In order to make the compilation and publication of modern history materials more, faster, better, and more economically, we must rely closely on the leadership of the Party, give play to collective strength, and divide labor and cooperate under unified planning. This kind of cooperation is essentially to implement the mass line in the compilation and publication of materials, and to further closely coordinate the compilation and publication of materials with scientific research and teaching work. At present, this kind of cooperation and coordination has begun to be strengthened, but it is still not done enough, and there are even some phenomena of mutual disconnection. On the one hand, the materials urgently needed for research work and teaching work cannot be compiled and published in time; on the other hand, many of the compiled and published materials have not been well utilized for research. In order to change this situation, the material publishing department should timely understand the current dynamics of historical scientific research and understand the needs of researchers and educators for materials; when formulating topic selection plans and determining the sorting methods for certain important materials, it should widely solicit the opinions of relevant academic groups, not only the opinions of experts, but also the opinions of the vast number of young researchers and educators. Relevant research institutions and academic groups should also put forward their own requirements for materials to the material publishing department at any time, and incorporate the sorting of materials into their research plans according to the unified plan and in combination with their own actual situation.
    Practice has proved that since the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the leadership of the Party, the large-scale mass movement and the promotion of cooperation in scientific research, we have achieved great results, which fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. As long as we abide by the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and adhere to putting politics in command and the mass line, we can create miracles that are unimaginable under the capitalist system, and the compilation and publication of modern history materials is naturally no exception.

　　关于中国近代史资料整理出版的几个问题
　　中华书局近代史编辑组
　　从鸦片战争到五四运动以前的近八十年中，中国社会经历了极其深刻的变化，民族矛盾和阶级矛盾十分尖锐。这一段曲折复杂的历史行程所留下来的历史资料，内容十分丰富，数量也十分庞大。早在1941年，毛泽东同志就向我们提出了研究鸦片战争以来的中国近百年史的任务，同时还明确地指示了进行这一研究工作的方向和方法。他说：“对于近百年的中国史，应聚集人材，分工合作地去做，克服无组织的状态。应先作经济史、政治史、军事史、文化史几个部门的分析的研究，然后才有可能作综合的研究。”（《改造我们的学习》）直到今天，毛泽东同志对研究中国近百年史的这些英明指示，仍然全部保留着它的极其重大的指导意义。
    我们知道，研究中国近代史的目的，就是要对从鸦片战争到五四运动这一时期的历史发展给以科学的总结，阐明中国近代社会阶级斗争和社会发展的规律，以便使这种研究有助于指导当前的伟大运动。近代史资料的整理出版，也就要围绕这个目的，从各个方面提供丰富具体的资料，以便使研究工作者占有大量的材料，更充分、更全面、更深刻地来论证和阐明中国近代社会阶级斗争和社会发展的规律。
    中国近代史资料极其庞大纷繁。即使不包括帝国主义侵华机关的文书档案和帝国主义分子的著述记载在内，初步估计其数量也恐不下几亿甚至十几亿字。对于这些庞大纷繁的史料，在解放以前的反动统治之下，是不可能进行有计划的整理的。全国解放以后，近代史的研究和史料的整理工作，出现了崭新的面貌。在党的正确领导和密切关怀下，由于历史研究工作者、教育工作者和有关的编辑出版工作者的积极努力，中国近代史料的整理出版工作，取得了不小的成绩。据极不完全的统计，从1949年到1959年的十年中，全国共出版有关中国近代史资料二百种左右。其中有些史料，不仅具有较高的史料价值，而且在整理方法上还具有较高的科学水平。这些史料的整理出版，无疑地丰富了中国近代史研究的内容，为研究工作者和教学工作者提供了许多方便的条件。
    虽然如此，近代史资料的整理出版工作还远远不能满足日益增长的实际需要。为了使它更好地为历史研究工作和教学工作服务，我们感到有如下几个问题需要加以解决。坚持政治挂帅，清除资产阶级思想
    第一，近代史资料的整理出版工作，是思想战线和科学研究领域中的一个不可缺少的组成部分。为了把这个工作做好，首先必须坚持政治挂帅，高高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，彻底克服那种认为整理出版史料可以脱离政治、可以脱离思想斗争的错误观点。事实证明，在史料的整理出版工作中，是存在着资产阶级和无产阶级的两条道路、两种思想的斗争的。比如，在对待史料的态度上，有人不问实际需要，不看史料价值，为史料而史料，为整理而整理，甚至为了猎奇，不加选择地去追求所谓“孤本秘籍”。也有人不是用马克思列宁主义的观点去分析史料，而是把史料的整理代替历史科学的研究。他们整理史料，不是为无产阶级的政治服务，为社会主义的科学研究和教学工作服务，而是把它看成是自己个人的“名山事业”。至于把持和垄断史料的现象，也还没有完全消除。与这种错误思想相联系，在史料整理的方法上，就是不加选择，把有用的和无用的东西兼收并蓄，甚至在序言或后记中，对古人和对只是作为一种材料用的古书备加赞扬推崇，或者完全没有必要地去作一些烦琐的文字校勘。所有这些，实际上都是资产阶级学术思想在整理史料工作上的反映。对这种资产阶级的思想观点，无疑地应该加以批判和克服。不过，我们也应该看到，就是这些少数抱有资产阶级学术观点的人，只要他们真正服从党的领导，真正愿意为人民服务，真正愿意学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，并且自觉地改造思想，那末他们就能够在实践中逐渐地克服资产阶级的思想观点，树立起无产阶级的世界观，从而在资料整理工作中，对人民作出有益的贡献。事实上，他们当中已经有很多人正在朝着这个方向努力，并且已经获得良好的效果。
    另外，也有一些人，他们对整理资料的工作，缺乏应有的重视，甚至把它看成是一种可有可无、无足轻重的工作。也有些人把整理资料，当成一种额外负担。他们认为整理史料不过是烦琐的技术工作，或者至少认为整理资料算不上科学研究。我们认为这是一种不正确的观点。党和毛泽东同志从来就教导我们，在研究问题的时候，必须首先占有大量的充分的材料，必须坚持观点和材料的统一。一个真正抱着实事求是的态度从事科学研究的人，他必定是十分重视对
  资料的积累和研究的。在科学面前，企图拣便宜、走
  捷径是行不通的。我们如果真正下决心去夺取科学堡
  垒，真正要去搞清楚科学领域中的一件事又一件事，
  那末我们不经过辛勤的劳动，不占有大量的材料，不
  对这些大量的材料作许许多多的清理、分析的工作，
  是不可能达到目的的。实际上真正有价值的经过认真
  研究整理出来的资料，必然是艰苦的科学研究的成
  果。当然，在实际工作中要有某些分工。比如，某些
  人着重作近代史的研究和教育工作，而某些人则把主
  要的力量放在整理史料上。这种分工是从整个社会主
  义建设事业的需要出发的，绝没有什么所谓“高低上
  下”之分。那种轻视整理资料的思想必须反对。
      我们整理出版史料，是为了向科学研究工作提供
  便利条件，是为了批判地继承遗产，为发展和繁荣社会
  主义的科学文化提供必要的条件。既要反对形形色色
  的资产阶级观点，又要给资料工作以应有的重视，
  使它在正确的思想指导之下，得以正常地健康地发
  展。
        加强计划性，合理组织力量
    第二，近几年来，近代史资料整理出版的计划性虽然逐步加强，但是仍然显得很不够。这一方面表现在，已经出版的近代史资料有一些不仅显得零碎和缺乏系统性，而且存在着不平衡的现象。比如，政治史、经济史方面的史料出版得较多，而文化史、军事史则出版得很少；革命斗争高潮和历次反侵略战争的有关史料出版得多些（这是完全必要的），而斗争暂时处于低潮或者两次战争中间的间隙时期的有关史料出版得过少；近代某些具有代表性人物的著作，也有的出版得较多，而有的则出得很少或根本没有出版；特别是对过去被资产阶级学者所忽视而对我们研究近代史又是较为重要的课题和有重要参考作用的史料，如少数兄弟民族的史料，近代革命斗争的调查资料，也还整理出版得不多，如此等等。另一方面表现在，科学研究机关、高等学校之间，相互联系、分工协作还作得不够，因此在工作中往往发生相互重复、相互交叉的现象。比如，有些本来并不需要重复整理的史料
  （如从明清实录中辑录经济资料，从档案、清人文集中辑录货币资料，编制近代史论文索引等）却有两个或两个以上的学术团体同时进行，而有些急需整理的史料或必要的工具书却又没人动手去做。
    为此，就需要根据研究工作和教学工作的需要情况和可能条件，制订一个比较全面而又切实可行的整理出版规划。而为了使这个规划订得尽可能地切合实际和便于实现，一方面需要对现有的史料，进行一次摸底排队的工作，以分别轻重缓急；另一方面需要在统一规划之下，更好地组织力量，分工合作。
      继续提高质量，反对片面追求数量
    第三，史料整理出版的质量，还有待进一步提高。就目前已经出版的一些近代史资料的情况来看，质量好的或较好的固然不少，但是也有不少史料的质量还不能令人满意。我们认为，史料书质量好坏取决于两个方面，一是史料本身的参考价值如何，一是整理出版工作者对待史料的立场观点是否正确和加工程度如何。目前往往会看到这样的情形，就是有些资料的整理出版缺乏明确的目的性，使人看不出这些资料到底是为着要解决历史科学研究和教学中的什么问题；有些资料出版得零碎片断，缺乏系统性；也有些本来具有较高价值的史料，但是由于整理者的观点不够正确、旗帜不够鲜明或者加工整理不善，史料的质量受到严重的影响。比如，对有些原作出之于反动统治阶级之手的部头较大的史料，在编辑出版的序言和说明中不就其内容、时代背景和参考作用等作具体的科学分析；对某些应作提要或应加按语的材料，不去表示编辑整理者的态度。在整理方法和加工程度上，有些史料书作得粗疏芜杂。比如，对有些内容较多的材料，不加内容提示性的标题；对有些可以适当分类编排的材料，不加分类；对有些本来可以选录编辑的资料，不加选录删汰，把有用的东西和根本无用的东西，泥沙俱下地一股脑儿原样照印；对有些应该附加必要索引的资料，不加索引；有些应该加以注释的名词，不加必要的注释；有些史料的文字校勘核对，作得很不准确。这样就给使用史料的人带来了许多不便，甚至为使用一条史料，而不得不去遍翻全书。这样也就必然降低史料的参考作用和使用价值。
    我们认为，为了提高近代史资料整理出版的质量，必须有明确的目的性，做到“要啥有啥”，而不能“有啥出啥”。这就是说，整理出版近代史料必须密切配合研究工作和教学工作的需要，选择史料价值较高、参考价值较大而又流传较少的书优先出版，而且
  进行比较细致的整理加工，力求使用方便。在书的前
  面应该有用马克思列宁主义观点写的序言或出版说
  明，对出版目的、史料价值和时代背景、作（编）者
  的政治态度以及史料来源、整理方法等，作必要的说
  明；对某些史料，特别是供广大青年研究工作者和教
  育工作者用的资料，还应该用马克思列宁主义的观
  点，在序言中作出必要的分析批判，并对某些史料内
  容作适当的说明，对一些生僻的名物和难懂的词句作
  浅明正确的注释；对翻检不便的资料，应该附上必要
  的索引。无论是哪件资料，文字校勘和引文出处，都
  要做到准确无误。为提高质量而斗争，是当前和今后
  近代史资料整理出版工作的首要任务。衡量资料整理
  出版工作的好坏，主要是看质量好不好，而不是看数
  量多不多。片面追求数量，忽视质量，实际上就是为
  整理而整理，为出版而出版，是脱离政治、脱离实
  际、脱离群众的表现。必须克服那种“有比无好、多
  比少好、越多越好”的思想，克服那种以“档案保管
  员保存旧纸”的方法对待资料的态度，坚持在无产阶
  级政治挂帅的条件下，有目的、有选择、有计划地进
  行整理出版工作。
      当然，我们在强调有目的、有选择、有计划地整
  理出版历史资料的时候，绝不是说可以任意删削资
  料，更不是说可以随意窜改史料。相反地，我们认为
  凡是有参考价值的资料，那怕是内容反动的反面资
  料，只要它对研究历史问题确实有用，而我们在序言、按语或注释中又作了必要的说明，那末我们就应该保
  持它原来的面貌，并且采取有效措施，把这些资料发行到真正有需要的读者手里，以便于研究工作者和教育工作者的使用，用反面的资料，写正面的文章。
  采取有效措施，加强工具书的编辑出版工作
    第四，我国近代史资料既然如此浩繁，那末为了参考使用的方便，就必须借助于各种必要的工具书。工具书按其性质来说，虽然它们不属历史资料的范围，但是它们与资料的整理和使用有着直接的密切的关系，因此，有必要把这个问题提出来谈一谈。应该说，目前有关中国近代史方面的工具书十分缺乏，这可以说是当前近代史书籍出版工作中一个薄弱的环节。随着近代史研究工作的日益开展，特别是随着大量的新生力量的迅速成长，无论是对研究工作还是对教学工作来说，对工具书的需要都十分迫切。可以设想，如果真正编辑出一批准确实用的工具书，那将为研究工作者和教学工作者带来多少方便，省却他们多少用来翻检史料的时间。因此，迅速采取有效措施，切实加强这一工作，是十分必要的。
    由于读者对象不同，他们对工具书的要求也不同。但是，不论对哪类读者来说，以下几类工具书是必不可少的：一、综合性的和专门性的、详细的和简明历史辞典；二、综合性的和专门性的、详细的和简明的年表、大事记以及历史地图等；三、各种索引和参考书目提要。为了满足读者的迫切需要，我们认为目前应该把工具书的编辑出版作为近代史资料整理出版工作的重点之一，大力进行。
        大搞群众运动，大兴协作之风
    为了把近代史资料的整理出版工作做得又多又快又好又省，就必须紧紧依靠党的领导，在统一规划之下，发挥集体力量，分工协作。这种协作，实质上就是要在资料整理出版工作中，贯彻执行群众路线，使资料的整理出版和科学研究、教学工作进一步密切配合起来。目前，这种协作和配合虽然开始加强，但还做得不够，甚至也还存在着某些互相脱节的现象。一方面研究工作和教学工作迫切需要的资料，不能及时整理出版；另一方面整理出版的许多资料，又没有很好地被利用来进行研究。为了改变这种状况，资料出版部门应该及时了解当前历史科学研究的动态，了解研究工作者和教育工作者对资料的需要情况；在制订选题计划和确定对某些重要资料的整理方法的时候，应该广泛征求有关学术团体的意见，不仅要征求专家的意见，而且更要征求广大青年研究工作者和教育工作者的意见。有关研究机关和学术团体，也应该随时向资料出版部门提出自己对资料的要求，并且根据统一的规划结合自己的实际情况，把整理资料纳入自己的研究计划中去。
    实践证明，大跃进以来，在科学研究工作中，由于在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，大兴协作之风，我们已经取得了巨大的成绩，这也充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。只要我们遵守毛泽东同志的教导，坚持政治挂帅和群众路线，我们就能够创造出在资本主义制度下所不敢设想的奇迹，近代史资料的整理出版工作自然也不例外。
