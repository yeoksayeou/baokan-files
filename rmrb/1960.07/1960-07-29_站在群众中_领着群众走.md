Standing Among the Masses, Leading the Masses Forward
Xing Guangxin, Secretary of the CCP Committee of Yutianpu Coal Mine, Chongqing

Not long ago, we implemented the "on-site office system" and the "three down" policy for political and ideological work (i.e., going down the mine, going to the workshops, and going to the kitchens), ushering in a major reform and a great turnaround in management systems, which changed the face of the enterprise. Now, not only do administrative cadres direct production underground, but Party and mass cadres also conduct political and ideological work underground. Party group meetings are held underground, "three-way combinations" (cadres, workers, and technicians) are done underground, and competitions are judged underground. The mine is filled with a tense and lively atmosphere of battle.

Looking back, these methods were taught to us by Chairman Mao and by the masses.

In coal mines, the management system of "underground production, above-ground command" is a remnant of bourgeois management systems and a breeding ground for bureaucracy. In the new situation, it hinders the further development of productive forces. The masses have long felt constrained and oppressed by this outdated management system. Some workers said, "Cadres only tell us to complete the plan on the ground, but when we encounter specific problems underground, no one solves them. How can the plan be completed?" Cadres also felt that directing underground production from the ground was like blind men touching an elephant. At that time, the development of the situation and the demands of the masses were concentrated on a single word: "change." But how to change? For a time, there was no good solution. Later, we restudied Chairman Mao's works. As early as 1943, Chairman Mao said, "In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must come from the masses, to the masses." We decided to go to the masses and conduct investigations and studies on the three major issues of "improving leadership methods, improving leadership style, and reforming the coal mine production management system," asking the masses for solutions.

After we left the office, went to the masses to make friends, and became pupils of the masses, we gained a lot of knowledge and learned many things we had never heard before.

The No. 4 coal mining team of Mine No. 1 had been a red banner team for several months. In June, the geological conditions deteriorated, and at the end of the month, they were still short of more than a thousand tons of coal to maintain the red banner. The situation was critical. The branch secretary convened a meeting of team cadres to study countermeasures. Some cadres, accustomed to rigid accounting, neglected dynamic accounting, so after much calculation, they still had no solution. It seemed they had to accept their bad luck and wait to rise again next month. The branch secretary of this team, Li En'yuan, was not satisfied with the information he received from the report, so he went down to the working face to discuss it with the workers. As a result, he came to a completely opposite conclusion: the advanced workers knew that they would soon lose the red banner this month, and they were full of enthusiasm. They rolled up their sleeves and guaranteed to the Party that they would complete the task no matter what! If they were short of a thousand tons of coal, they would dig it out with their bare hands! Sure enough, thanks to the joint hard work of the cadres and the masses, the daily output, which had been more than a hundred tons, reached more than three hundred tons in the last few days. At the end of the month, they overfulfilled the task and maintained the red banner.

The No. 11 coal mining team of Mine No. 3 was having a high-yield day when suddenly the coal chute was blocked by a large rock. The rock was so big that production stopped. According to the usual practice, this shift would have to stop production and dig another chute, which would take several days. How could production be stopped during a high-yield period? Everyone was anxious. At this time, the Party group leader, Zhao Shi'quan, convened an expanded emergency Party group meeting at the working face, asking everyone to come up with ideas on how to get the coal out as soon as possible. Communist Party member You Bingquan offered a suggestion at the meeting, and a coal chute was opened that shift, restoring production.

After learning about these situations, we gained an insight: the underground is the front line of coal mine production, the site of the struggle and activities of the broad masses, and the forefront for concretely implementing the Party's policies and ensuring the completion of production tasks. The first line of political work must be placed at the working face.

Holding investigation meetings is an important method for studying problems. We have convened many such meetings, discussing the issue of leadership style with cadres working at the grassroots level, from which we have discovered many good experiences. Xiang Shaohua, deputy secretary of the general branch of Mine No. 2, regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, had to go to the workshop every day to find out if the workers were sleeping well and how everyone's health was. If he found that someone's quilt was not properly covered, he would help cover it. If there were many mosquitoes, he would light mosquito coils for the workers to drive them away. Once, he found that worker Li Shuzhang was ill. He asked about the cause and symptoms of the illness and told Li Shuzhang to rest assured while he went to the hospital to get medicine. Li Shuzhang stopped him and said, "Secretary Xiang, it's so late, and the road is so far, don't go, let me go to the hospital myself tomorrow." Xiang Shaohua replied, "For a sick person, getting medicine an hour earlier will have a much better therapeutic effect. If you get better a day earlier, there will be one more capable hand in production. What's the big deal with me taking a trip?" Xiang Shaohua brought the medicine back, found hot water for Li Shuzhang to take it, and then helped him to bed, staying busy until dawn. This incident moved every worker in Mine No. 2. Many workers said, "The Party cares for us so much, we must do a better job in production. We will never let the Party down. We will overcome any difficulty, no matter how great."

From here, I received another vivid education in the mass line. To better mobilize the masses, empty talk is not enough. We must be down-to-earth and do a lot of work, caring for both the production and the lives of the masses. The more we care for the masses, the more wholeheartedly the masses will care for production, and the greater their enthusiasm will be. The workshop and the kitchen have very broad platforms and positions for political and ideological work. Solidly solving one or two specific problems for the masses in these places is much more effective than a long report full of empty talk.

Our practice of going deep into the masses and studying problems proves that new things are sprouting among the masses every moment. Summarizing their experiences has further strengthened our confidence. Through investigation and research, the masses have taught me many things. After the Party committee summarized and improved, it put forward the call for "on-site office work," "political work going down the mine," "political work going to the workshop," and "political work going to the kitchen," which was supported by all the workers in the mine and has now become institutionalized and regularized.

Now, there have been many significant changes in the production atmosphere in the mine, which are "four different" compared with the past: In the past, when work started, the workers went down the mine, and the cadres went to the office; now the cadres and workers go down the mine side by side. This is the first difference. In the past, the workers carried pneumatic drills, and the cadres guarded the telephones; now the workers carry pneumatic drills, and the cadres carry shovels. This is the second difference. In the past, the workers' miners' lamps were shaking on their heads, and the cadres' miners' lamps were shaking in their hands; now everyone is the same, shaking on their heads (everyone is working). This is the third difference. In the past, at meetings, the cadres always gave reports, and the workers listened to the reports; now, at meetings, the cadres speak, and the workers also speak, and everyone comes up with ideas and solutions together. This is the fourth difference.

On-site office work and political work going down the mine are revolutionary measures to thoroughly improve leadership style and working methods based on the characteristics of coal mine production. They are major reforms in the management system of coal mine enterprises and a bright flower that has bloomed in adhering to the general line and the Great Leap Forward. We must take extra care to cultivate it and let it grow even stronger and brighter.

### 站在群众中  领着群众走

    站在群众中  领着群众走
    中共重庆市鱼田堡煤矿委员会书记　邢广信
    不久以前，我们实行了“井下办公制度”和政治思想工作“三下”（即下井、下工房、下厨房），在管理制度上来了一个大改革和大翻身，改变了企业面貌。现在不但行政干部在井下指挥生产，党群干部也在井下作政治思想工作，党的小组会在井下开，“三结合”在井下搞，竞赛在井下评，井下充满了紧张活跃的战斗气氛。
    回想起来，这些办法都是毛主席教给我们的，也是群众教给我们的。
    在煤矿，“井下生产、地面指挥”的管理制度，是资产阶级管理制度的残余，它是滋长官僚主义的温床。在新的形势下，它障碍着生产力的进一步发展。群众对这种过时的管理制度，早已感到束缚和压抑。有的工人说：“干部光在地面叫我们完成计划，到了井下遇着具体问题又没有人解决，计划怎么完得成呢？”干部也感到：蹲在地面指挥井下的生产，像瞎子摸象一样。当时形势发展和群众要求，都集中在一个“变”字上。可是怎么变呢？一时还没有好办法。后来，我们重温了毛主席的著作。早在1943年毛主席就说过：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去”。我们决定到群众中去，针对“改进领导方法，改进领导作风，改革煤矿生产管理制度”三大问题作调查研究，向群众要办法。
    当我们走出办公室，到群众中去交朋友、作群众的小学生以后，增长了不少知识，了解到许多前所未闻的事。
    一井采煤四组，前几个月都是红旗掌子面小组。6月份，地质条件变差了，快到月底，还差千多吨煤才能保住红旗。情况危急了，支部书记召集了小组干部会议，研究对策。有些干部由于习惯于算死账，忽略了算活账，因此算来算去，还是没有办法。看来，只好自认晦气，待下月东山再起。这个小组的支部书记李恩源不满足于听汇报得到的情况，又下到掌子面去与工人同商量。结果得出了完全相反的结论：先进工人们知道这月快保不住红旗了，群情奋发，他们撩衣卷袖地向党保证：非完成不可！差这千把吨煤，用手捧也要捧出来！果然，由于干部和群众共同苦战，原来日产百多吨，最后几天日产三百多吨，月终超额完成任务，保住了红旗。
    三井采煤十一组，有一天正值高产，溜煤眼子忽然一下子就被大石块塞住了，石头很大，生产停顿了。照常规，这一班只好不生产，另冲一个眼子上去，而生产要停好几天。高产时候，怎么能停产呢？大伙都急了。这时，党小组长赵世全召集党团员和积极分子在掌子面开了个火线党小组扩大会，找大家想办法，如何可以尽快的出煤。共产党员尤丙全，在会上献了一计，当班就开了一个溜煤眼，恢复了生产。
    了解到这些情况以后，我们得到一个启示：井下是煤矿生产的第一线，是广大群众斗争和活动的现场，是具体贯彻党的方针、保证完成生产任务的最前方，政治工作的第一线必须摆在掌子面。
    开调查会，是研究问题的重要方法。我们曾召集多次这样的会议，和基层工作的干部讨论领导作风的问题，从中发现了许多好经验。二井总支副书记向绍华，他不管天晴落雨，每天必须到工房，了解工人睡得好不好，了解大家身体如何。发现谁的被子没盖好，他就帮助盖好，蚊子多了，他就为工人点燃蚊烟驱蚊子。有一次，他发现工人李树章病了，他问清了发病的原因和病状，便叫李树章安心休息，他去医院取药。李树章拦住说：“向书记，天这么晚，路又这么远，不要去了，让我明天自己上医院去看吧。”向绍华回答说：“生病的人，能够早一小时吃到药，治疗效果会大得多，你早一天好，生产上就多一把能手，我跑一趟有什么关系呢？”向绍华取药回来，又找开水让李树章服药，吃了药，又扶他睡下，直忙到天亮。这件事感动了二井每一个工人，许多工人都说：“党这样关怀我们，我们更要搞好生产，我们决不辜负党的关怀，天大的困难也要克服”。
    从这里，我又受到一次生动的群众路线的教育。要更好地发动群众，说空话是不行的，必须脚踏实地，做许多工作，既关心群众生产，也关心群众生活。我们愈关心群众，群众就愈能全心全意地关心生产，干劲就愈大。政治思想工作在工房和厨房有十分宽阔的讲坛和阵地，在这些地方扎实地替群众解决一项两项具体问题，比空话连篇的大报告有效得多。
    我们深入群众，研究问题的实践证明，新生事物每时每刻都在群众中萌芽着，总结了他们的经验，更加坚定了我们的信心。通过调查研究，群众教会我许多东西。经过党委总结提高，提出了“井下办公”、“政治工作下井”、“政治工作下工房”、“政治工作下厨房”的号召，得到全矿职工的拥护，现在已经形成制度化、经常化。
    现在，井下的生产气氛有很多显著的转变，和从前比较起来，有“四不同”：以前上班时，工人下井，干部上办公室；现在干部和工人并肩下井。这是一不同。以前工人扛风镐，干部守电话；现在工人扛风镐，干部扛掏扒。这是二不同。以前工人的矿灯在头上晃，干部的矿灯在手上晃；现在大家都是一样，在头上晃（都劳动了）。这是三不同。以前开会，总是干部作报告，工人听报告；现在开会，干部讲，工人也讲，大家共同出主意，想办法。这是四不同。
    井下办公，政治工作下井，这是根据煤矿生产特点，彻底改进领导作风和工作方法的革命措施，是煤矿企业管理制度上的重大改革，是坚持总路线、大跃进开出的一支鲜花。我们一定加意培养，让它生长得更加茁壮鲜艳。
