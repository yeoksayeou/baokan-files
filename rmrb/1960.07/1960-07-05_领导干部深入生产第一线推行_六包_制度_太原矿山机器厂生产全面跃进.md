Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Production Front Line to Promote the "Six Guarantees" System
Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Achieves Overall Production Leap Forward

(Our newspaper Taiyuan 4th dispatch) The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Party Committee organized more than 600 cadres throughout the plant to go deep into workshops and teams to promote the "Six Guarantees" system (guaranteeing ideology, production, innovation, propaganda, competition, and livelihood). They ate, worked, innovated, overcame difficulties, and carried out various activities together with the broad masses of workers, powerfully promoting the completion of all production targets of the plant and achieving an overall leap forward in high yield, high quality, low cost, and safe production.

The plant's implementation of cadres going deep into the production front line to carry out the "Six Guarantees" activities began in April of this year. The daily specific tasks of the "Six Guarantees" cadres are: (1) to help workshops and teams mobilize the masses, vigorously promote propaganda, organize competitions, spread good people and good deeds, and promote new technologies and new experiences; (2) to discover problems and study them together with the masses to solve them in a timely manner; (3) to grasp the progress of the movement, explore and summarize experiences, strengthen communication between superiors and subordinates, and report the situation to the branch and the Party committee in a timely manner; (4) to work and live with the workers, and strengthen the relationship between employees; (5) to strengthen the management of production teams, help the teams establish "propaganda networks," "technology networks," "dispatching networks," as well as various management systems such as planning, statistics, and accounting, and help workers do a good job in study and life.

Since the cadres of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant implemented the "Six Guarantees" activities, their work style has greatly changed. The past "five excesses," "five shortages," and "three unclears" have become "five shortages" (less time spent in the office, fewer meetings, fewer affairs, fewer procedures, fewer opinions from the masses) and "five excesses" (more time spent going down, more contact with the masses, more knowledge of the situation, more methods, more problem-solving) and "three timely" (timely discovery of problems, timely solution of problems, timely summary and promotion of advanced experience). Therefore, the bureaucratic style of cadres being divorced from reality, divorced from production, and divorced from the masses has been greatly overcome, and the labor enthusiasm of the workers has been further inspired, and the production level has rapidly risen. As of June 11, the plant's products and output had completed the semi-annual plan ahead of schedule. According to the national plan, nineteen sets of products, totaling 4,623 tons, should have been completed in the first half of the year. By the end of May, fifteen sets of products, totaling 4,642 tons, had already been completed.

Since the launch of the "Six Guarantees" and "Five Togetherness" activities, because the cadres personally went to the production front line and solved key production problems together with the workers, technological innovation has been greatly promoted, ensuring product quality. The 300-ton friction press is one of the plant's key products. After several design reforms and technological innovations, the product quality standards could not be consistently guaranteed, affecting installation and assembly. After He Changxing, a quality inspector from the inspection section, was transferred to a machining workshop, he led everyone to vigorously carry out innovation targeting this key quality issue. He changed the installation of the shaft wire loop from hammering with a hammer to a semi-mechanized operation using a hook wrench, making the smoothness of the shaft wire loop reach the required quality standards and ensuring that all friction press parts met the quality standards stipulated by the state. Since April, the product quality of processed parts throughout the plant has reached over 99.97% every month.

The implementation of the "Six Guarantees" activities has also promoted a great revolution in product design and technology, thereby greatly reducing costs. Under the leadership of the chief engineer, the plant's technical personnel adopted a method of combining use, manufacturing, and design, and comprehensively launched a mass product design and technology revolution. In just one month, 52 types of products were transformed, saving 492,600 work hours and 838 tons of materials, saving the country more than 1.584 million yuan. This has led to a monthly decrease in costs. In May, costs were 16.25% lower than the national plan and 1.99% lower than in April, achieving an overall and continuous leap forward.

    领导干部深入生产第一线推行“六包”制度
    太原矿山机器厂生产全面跃进
    本报太原4日电　太原矿山机器厂党委会，组织全厂六百多名干部，深入到车间、小组、推行“六包”制度（包思想、包生产、包革新、包宣传、包竞赛、包生活），和广大工人群众同吃、同劳动、同搞革新、同克服困难、同开展各种活动。有力地推动了全厂各项生产指标的完成，实现了高产、优质、低成本和安全生产的全面跃进。
    这个厂推行干部深入生产第一线，开展“六包”活动，是从今年4月开始的。“六包”干部的日常具体任务是：（1）帮助车间、小组发动群众，大搞宣传，组织竞赛，传播好人好事，推广新技术，新经验；（2）发现问题，和群众共同研究，及时解决；（3）掌握运动进展情况，摸索和总结经验，加强上下联系，及时向支部，党委反映情况；（4）和工人同劳动，同生活，密切职工关系；（5）加强生产小组管理，帮助小组建立“宣传网”“技术网”“调度网”以及计划、统计、核算等各种管理制度，并帮助工人搞好学习和生活。
    太原矿山机器厂的干部推行“六包”活动以来，作风大有转变。过去“五多”、“五少”、  “三不清”，变为“五少”（蹲办公室少、开会少、事务少、手续少、群众意见少）、“五多”（下去的时间多、接触群众多、掌握情况多、办法多、解决问题多）、“三及时”（发现问题及时，解决问题及时，总结推广先进经验及时）。因而，大大克服了干部的脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离群众的作风，进一步鼓舞了工人的劳动积极性，生产水平迅速上升。截至6月11日，全厂产品、产量提前完成了上半年计划。按照国家计划，上半年应该完成产品十九套，四千六百二十三吨，到5月底，已完成了十五套四千六百四十二吨的产品。
    开展“六包”、“五同”活动以来，由于干部亲临生产第一线，和工人共同解决生产关键问题，因而大大推动了技术革新，保证了产品质量。三百吨磨擦压力机，是这个厂的重点产品之一，经过几次的设计改革和工艺革新，仍不能经常保证产品质量标准，影响安装配套。检查科质量检查员何昌兴下放到一加工车间后，针对这个质量关键，领导大家大搞革新，把安装轴丝圈由用鎯头打，改成了钩头搬手半机械化操作，使轴丝圈光滑程度，达到了要求的质量标准，保证了磨擦压力机件件合乎国家规定的质量标准。从4月份以来全厂加工件的产品质量月月达到99.97％以上。
    开展“六包”活动，还促进了产品设计和工艺的大革命，从而大大降低了成本。全厂的技术人员在总工程师的带领下，采取了使用、制作、设计三结合的办法，全面展开了群众性的产品设计和工艺大革命。仅一个月时间，就改造了产品五十二种，节约工时四十九万二千六百个，节约材料八百三十八吨，为国家节约了一百五十八万四千多元。使成本逐月下降。5月份比国家计划降低了16.25％，比4月份降低了1.99％，实现了全面持续跃进。
