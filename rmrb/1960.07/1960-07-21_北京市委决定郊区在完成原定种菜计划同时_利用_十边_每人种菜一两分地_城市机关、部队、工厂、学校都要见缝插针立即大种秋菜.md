The Beijing Municipal Party Committee held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee today to discuss the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on autumn vegetable production, and decided to further mobilize the masses. While ensuring the completion of the established autumn vegetable planting plan, they will immediately organize a campaign to launch a mass movement to plant "Ten Sides" on a large scale. Rural people's communes should strive to plant an average of one to two fen of vegetable land per person, producing 1,000 jin of autumn vegetables. City government offices, military units, factories, and schools should seize the opportunity, seize every opportunity to plant autumn vegetables on a large scale.

The meeting reviewed the agricultural production work of the previous stage and made comprehensive arrangements for agricultural activities in the coming period.

During the first ten-day period of summer, Beijing suburbs launched a blitzkrieg centered on seizing opportunities to plant and weed. Now, in addition to the rice planting plan being completed and the sweet potato planting task nearing completion, radishes have begun to be planted on a large scale, eliminating a large amount of wasteland. The meeting decided, in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions and in light of the current specific situation on Beijing's agricultural production front, to launch a second blitzkrieg from the first day of the second ten-day period of summer (July 21) to the end of this month. Grasp production, grasp flood prevention, grasp the lives of the masses, and vigorously carry out political and ideological work around these, and vigorously carry out mass movements.

The meeting pointed out that now is the golden season for agricultural production, and all arable land should be rapidly planted with whatever can be planted, and strive to plant more and harvest more by every possible means. The meeting emphasized that planting autumn vegetables on a large scale on "Ten Sides" land has significant economic and political significance for ensuring the city's vegetable supply, running public canteens well, and preventing disasters and preparing for famine. The meeting also pointed out that weeding is the central task of current field management, and it is necessary to eliminate old wasteland and prevent new wasteland, and strive to weed major autumn crops three times. At the same time, closely integrate weeding with fertilizer accumulation and pig raising.

The meeting pointed out that this campaign should also prepare for the next campaign. The main task of the next campaign will be to rush to plant Chinese cabbage. To this end, all vegetable areas must immediately carry out preparations for planting vegetables, determine plots, level the land, and prepare fertilizer and seeds.

The meeting also made arrangements for flood prevention, flood control, and arranging the lives of the masses.

The meeting pointed out that the fundamental guarantee for completing the above tasks is to strengthen the ideological and political work of the masses, deeply mobilize the masses, and carry out mass competition and evaluation movements. The meeting also pointed out that properly arranging production tasks and improving labor efficiency are issues that must be paid attention to in current leadership work. For central tasks, it is necessary to be good at concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles; but central tasks must be combined with general tasks, and it is necessary to seize central tasks to drive general tasks forward.

The meeting instructed party committees at all levels to immediately discuss the central instructions and the above arrangements of the municipal party committee, and arrange their own work according to the specific circumstances of their counties, communes, and teams, and take prompt action.

    北京市委决定郊区在完成原定种菜计划同时
    利用“十边”每人种菜一两分地
    城市机关、部队、工厂、学校都要见缝插针立即大种秋菜
    本报讯  中共北京市委今天举行常委扩大会议，讨论中共中央、国务院关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示，决定进一步发动群众，在保证完成既定的秋菜种植计划的同时，立即组织战役，开展一个大种“十边”的群众运动，农村人民公社要力争每人平均种好一两分菜地，生产秋菜一千斤。城市各机关、部队、工厂、学校，都要抓紧时机，见缝就插，大种秋菜。
    会议检查了前一阶段的农业生产工作，并对今后一个时期的农事活动作了全面安排。
    北京郊区在进入头伏期间，开展了一个以抢种抢锄为中心的突击战役。现在，除水稻栽种计划已经完成、白薯种植任务即将完成外，并且开始大种萝卜，消灭了大量草荒。会议决定根据中央指示的精神，结合北京农业生产战线上当前的具体情况，从进入二伏的第一天（21日）起到本月底，开展第二个突击战役。抓生产，抓防涝，抓群众生活，围绕这些大力进行政治思想工作，大搞群众运动。
    会议指出，现在是农业生产的黄金季节，所有能种的土地，都要迅速一律种下去，能种什么就种什么，千方百计争取多种多收。会议强调指出，在“十边”土地上大种秋菜，对保证城市吃菜、办好公共食堂和防灾备荒，具有重大的经济意义和政治意义。会议还指出，锄草是当前田间管理的中心任务，要消灭旧荒，防止新荒，力争大秋作物锄三遍。同时结合锄草把积肥和养猪的工作紧紧地抓起来。
    会议指出，这个战役还要为下一个战役做好准备。下一战役的主要任务，将是抢种大白菜。为此，从现在起，各种菜地区必须立即进行种菜的准备工作，落实地块，平整土地，备好肥料、籽种。
    会议并对防汛防涝、安排群众生活等问题作了部署。
    会议指出，完成上述任务的根本保证，是加强群众的思想工作和政治工作，深入地发动群众，开展群众竞赛评比运动。会议同时指出，妥善地安排生产任务，提高劳动效率，是当前领导工作中必须注意的一个问题。对于中心工作，要善于集中优势兵力，打歼灭战；但中心工作必须和一般工作相结合，要抓紧中心工作把一般工作带动起来。
    会议责成各级党委立即讨论中央的指示和市委的上述部署，并根据本县、本社、本队的具体情况安排自己的工作，迅速行动。
