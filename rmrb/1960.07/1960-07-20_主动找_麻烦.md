　　Proactively Seeking "Trouble"
　　Kong Sang
    The No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant won the national red flag in just a few months. One of their important experiences is to proactively seek "trouble."

    Why are the comrades of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant able to proactively seek trouble?

    The secret here is: trouble in work is unavoidable. Because objective things are very complex, intertwined with all kinds of contradictions. Where there are contradictions, there is "trouble." To do our work well, we must resolve these contradictory "troubles." Therefore, we must adopt very meticulous working methods, and we must take different approaches according to different situations. That is, we must use different methods to solve different contradictions. If we try to save trouble and use simplified methods to deal with complex problems, then from a temporary and local point of view, the problem seems to be solved, but from the effect, the problem is not really solved. The comrades of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant are seeking practical results. They proactively seek "trouble" and take meticulous working methods to solve complex problems. When the leadership has correctly recognized that some advanced experiences are worth promoting, they do not simply make decisions and use administrative methods to force the masses to implement them. They understand that promoting advanced experience is a complex and meticulous task. There are ideological problems and technical problems. When some cadres and masses hold a skeptical attitude towards advanced experience, a simple written decision cannot guarantee the real promotion of advanced experience. Therefore, they adopted a method that seemed to be "troublesome", allowing the masses to draw correct conclusions from their own practice and find ways to overcome difficulties. As a result, they achieved practical results, and advanced experience was quickly and consciously promoted by the masses.

    Some comrades are not like this. They do not carefully investigate the complexity of objective things, but are careless, using simplified methods to deal with complex problems, and using generalized methods to deal with special problems. Therefore, although they have good intentions and want to solve problems quickly and well, the results often go against their wishes. The Party requires us to go to the front line, and many comrades have also gone to the front line. The purpose is to discover problems in time, solve problems quickly, and promote the continuous leap forward in production. If we go down, eat, live, and work with the masses, but do not change the simplified work style, are afraid of trouble, and want to take "shortcuts", then we cannot fully realize the Party's requirements.

    Does proactively seeking trouble mean advocating slow progress and endless discussions? Of course not. On the contrary, what we advocate is decisive action and swift execution. Proactively seeking trouble is precisely to make correct judgments, find correct methods, and enable the leadership's determination to quickly become the action of the masses. This is precisely having both discussion and decision, and it is full discussion and correct decision. Because, proactively seeking trouble is to recognize the true face of things with the masses, to recognize its complexity; it is to discuss with the masses, to find the most accurate and appropriate solutions together. Proactively seeking trouble is precisely the most efficient, most effective, and most proactive working method.

    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, whoever wants to do the fastest and best must be the least afraid of trouble, and proactively seek trouble. This is the most valuable experience of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant.

### 主动找“麻烦”

　　主动找“麻烦”
　　孔桑
    上钢一厂平炉车间在短短的几个月里夺得了全国的红旗。他们的重要经验之一，就是主动找“麻烦”。
    为什么上钢一厂平炉车间的同志们能够主动地去找麻烦呢？
    这里的奥妙是：工作中的麻烦是避免不了的。因为客观事物十分复杂，交织着各色各样的矛盾。有矛盾就有“麻烦”。我们要把工作做好，就要去解决这些“麻烦”的矛盾。所以，就必须采取十分细致的工作方法，必须根据不同的情况采取不同的做法。也就是要用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾。如果图省事，用简单化的方法去处理复杂的问题，那么，从一时一地看来，问题好像是解决了，但是从效果来看，问题其实并没有解决。上钢一厂平炉车间的同志们是求实效的，他们主动地找
  “麻烦”，采取了细致的工作方法去解决复杂的问题。当领导上已经正确地认识到一些先进经验是值得推广的时候，他们并不简单地做决定，用行政的方法来强制群众执行。他们了解到，推广先进经验是一件复杂的细致的工作，这里有思想问题，也有技术问题。当干部和群众中有一部分人对先进经验抱着怀疑态度的时候，简单的一纸决定不可能保证先进经验的真正推广。因此，他们采取了看来是“麻烦”的方法，让群众从自己的实践中得出正确的结论和找到克服困难的方法。结果取得了实效，先进经验迅速地被群众自觉地推广开了。
    有些同志却不是这样。他们不去细心地考察客观事物的复杂性，而是粗枝大叶，用简单化的方法处理复杂的问题，用一般化的方法处理特殊的问题。因此，他们虽然一片好心，想把问题解决得快，解决得好，结果却往往事与愿违。党要求我们到第一线去，很多同志也到了第一线。目的是为了及时地发现问题，迅速地解决问题，推动生产不断地跃进。如果我们下去了，也和群众同吃、同住、同劳动了，但是没有改变简单化的工作作风，怕麻烦，想走“捷径”，结果就不能圆满地实现党的要求。
    主动找麻烦，是不是提倡慢慢腾腾，议而不决呢？当然不是。相反，我们提倡的是当机立断，雷厉风行。主动地找麻烦，正是为了做出正确的判断，找出正确的方法，使得领导的决心能够迅速地变成群众的行动。这恰恰是既有议又有决，而且是充分的议，正确的决。因为，主动地找麻烦，就是同群众一起去认识事物的本来面目，认识它的复杂性；就是同群众一起商量，一起寻找最准确最恰当的解决方法。主动找麻烦，这正是效率最高、效果最好、最能掌握主动的工作方法。
    在大跃进的时代，谁要想做得最快最好，谁就要最不怕麻烦，而且主动地去寻找麻烦。这就是上钢一厂平炉车间最宝贵的经验。
