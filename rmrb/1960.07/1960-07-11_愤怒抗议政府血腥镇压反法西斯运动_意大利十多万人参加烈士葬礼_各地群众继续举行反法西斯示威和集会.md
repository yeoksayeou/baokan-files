Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 10th: More than 150,000 people in the northern Italian industrial center of Reggio Emilia attended the funeral of five anti-fascist martyrs on the 9th. They were killed by police during an anti-fascist demonstration on the 7th.

　　On the 9th, the entire city of Reggio Emilia flew flags at half-mast. The city's two central squares were packed with people from all directions. The coffins of the five martyrs were covered with red carnations. On the streets through which the coffins passed, angry people held up thousands of resistance movement flags to express their grief and respect to the five new martyrs of anti-fascism.

　　Among those attending the funeral were Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, Italian Resistance Movement leader Ferruccio Parri, Italian General Confederation of Labour Secretary Fernando Santi, and many members of parliament representing the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Social Democratic Party, and Republican Radical Party.

　　Many delegations from Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Rome and other cities also attended the funeral.

　　Luciano Romagnoli, secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, pointed out in a speech to the masses that the premeditated massacre that bloodied Reggio Emilia was part of a larger provocative conspiracy by a government colluding with fascists. He demanded that those responsible for the atrocity be punished and that the current government step down.

　　In Palermo and Catania, the two major cities on the Italian southern island of Sicily, the masses continued to demonstrate on the 9th to protest the authorities' massacre of anti-fascist demonstrators in the two cities on the 8th. So far, it has been confirmed that a total of four people were killed by police in Palermo and Catania on the 8th.

　　Police fired tear gas at demonstrators in Palermo on the 9th and arrested five more demonstrators.

　　In Catania, hundreds of people gathered in front of the police station on the 9th to demand the release of the anti-fascist demonstrators who were arrested on the 8th. The police immediately unreasonably arrested ten more people.

　　In Naples, 15,000 people participated in an anti-fascist rally on the 9th. Representatives of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Radical Party, Republican Party, and Social Democratic Party spoke at the meeting. Many intellectuals also participated in the conference, including the famous actor and playwright Eduardo De Filippo, who expressed his full support for the Italian people's struggle against fascism and reactionaries in his speech.

　　The situation remained very tense throughout Italy on the 9th. On the streets next to most of the squares in Rome, there were police units and armed military police in jeeps, specially prepared to suppress mass demonstrations. Italian Communist Party members of parliament pointed out that the Italian government had turned Rome into a barracks.

　　Large numbers of police forces were also concentrated on the streets in other major Italian cities on the 9th.

　　Encouraged by the Italian government, the arrogance of the neo-fascists is becoming increasingly rampant. On the 9th, a senior leader of the neo-fascist party "Italian Social Movement" even declared that the neo-fascist party "has 200,000 to 300,000 people ready to go to the streets to help the police" suppress anti-fascist demonstrations.

　　愤怒抗议政府血腥镇压反法西斯运动
　　意大利十多万人参加烈士葬礼
　　各地群众继续举行反法西斯示威和集会
    新华社10日讯　罗马消息：9日在意大利北部的工业中心勒佐—艾米里亚有十五万人以上参加了五个反法西斯烈士的葬礼，他们是在7日的反法西斯示威中被警察杀害的。
    9日，勒佐—艾米里亚全市下半旗。在这个城市的两个中心广场上挤满了来自四面八方的人群。在五位烈士的灵柩上复盖着红色的石竹花。在灵柩经过的街道上，愤怒的人们高举着数千面抵抗运动的旗帜，向五位反法西斯主义的新烈士表示哀悼和敬意。
    在参加葬仪的人们的行列当中，有意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂、意大利抵抗运动领袖费鲁乔·帕里、意大利总工会书记费尔南多·杉蒂和代表共产党、社会党、社会民主党、共和激进党的许多议员。
    来自热那亚、波伦亚、佛罗伦萨、罗马和其他城市的许多代表团也参加了葬礼。
    意大利总工会书记卢契安诺·罗马尼奥利在向群众讲话时指出，这次血染勒佐—艾米里亚的预谋的屠杀是同法西斯分子相勾结的政府的整个挑衅阴谋的一部分。他要求惩办应对这次暴行负责的人，并要求现政府下台。
    在意大利南部西西里岛上的两大城市巴勒莫和喀大尼亚，群众9日继续示威，抗议当局在8日屠杀这两个城市的反法西斯示威者。到目前为止，已经查明，8日在巴勒莫和喀大尼亚共有四人被警察杀害。
    警察在9日对巴勒莫的示威群众施放了催泪弹，并且又逮捕了五个示威者。
    在喀大尼亚，9日有数百人聚集在警察局门口，要求释放8日被逮捕的反法西斯示威者。警察当即又无理地逮捕了十人。
    在那不勒斯，9日有一万五千人参加了一次反法西斯的集会。在这个会上，共产党、社会党、激进党、共和党、社会民主党的代表们都登台讲话。参加这次大会的还有许多知识分子，其中有著名演员和喜剧作家爱德华多·菲利波，他在讲话中表示完全支持意大利人民反对法西斯主义和反动派的斗争。
    在意大利全国各地，9日的形势仍然十分紧张。在罗马大部分广场旁边的街道上，都有乘着吉普车的专门准备镇压群众示威的警察部队和武装军警。意大利共产党议员指出，意大利政府已经把罗马变成了一个兵营。
    在意大利其他大城市，9日也集中了大量的警察部队在街上站岗。
    在意大利政府的鼓励下，新法西斯分子的气焰正在变得愈来愈嚣张。9日，新法西斯党“意大利社会运动”的一个高级负责人竟然宣称，新法西斯党“有二、三十万人准备到街上去帮助警察”镇压反法西斯示威。
    同时，意大利抵抗运动全国委员会青年部，许多大学教授、知识分子、律师、建筑师、作家以及艺术家的团体正在分别发出呼吁书和宣言，要求解散新法西斯党和要求塔姆布罗尼政府辞职。在罗马、都灵、彼萨、巴图亚、波伦亚、佛罗伦萨、威尼斯和其他城市，意大利全国游击队员协会也发出了一项呼吁，要求人们为反对法西斯主义重新抬头，争取继续发扬抵抗运动思想，为争取塔姆布罗尼政府辞职而斗争。
