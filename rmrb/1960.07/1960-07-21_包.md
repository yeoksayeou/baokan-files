    The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is a well-known new-type factory nationwide. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, they have created a whole set of socialist enterprise management systems with Chinese characteristics and style. This is already well known to many comrades, especially those in the industrial sector.

    On the major matter of supporting agriculture and agricultural technological transformation, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has also created a set of practices. In the past two years, this factory has helped Jintang County, Guan County, and the suburbs of Chengdu, among other places, to establish machinery factories, fertilizer factories, alcohol factories, and small hydropower stations; supported the entire province with hundreds of thousands of tools and a large amount of electrical wire, electric motors, and transformers; repaired and manufactured a considerable amount of mechanical equipment; and processed many parts and components. They adopted a method of factory-level responsibility to communes, workshop-level responsibility to management areas (production brigades), and team-level responsibility to production teams, with tiered responsibility, counterpart contracting, and everyone participating. Now, "Bao" (contracting), has become a trend in all walks of life in Sichuan Province to support agriculture. Large factories contract with large counties, medium factories with medium-sized counties, and small factories with small counties. All counties and communes in the province have factories and various sectors responsible for support, with no blank spots.

    People often call large-scale collaboration a communist style; they praise "giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties for oneself" as a noble quality; these are all the spirit of our times. "Bao" (contracting) also embodies this spirit. "Do you have difficulties? We'll take care of it!" "What do you need? We'll take care of it!" Listen, this is the voice of our heroic working class, and even when it falls to the ground, it rings clearly. Is "taking care of it" an easy task? Can it be achieved with a single shout? No, absolutely not. When workers say such a sentence, they fully know its weight and fully understand what kind of difficulties are waiting ahead. Perhaps there are problems with raw materials, perhaps there are problems with tools, perhaps there are problems with labor, perhaps there are problems with time… In short, they know that "taking care of it" is not an easy task. However, so what? Can the heroic working class be held back by these problems? Can anything hinder the profound fraternal affection between workers and peasants? Look, this communist flower of "taking care of it" has yielded rich fruits: the friendship between workers and peasants is becoming more and more solid; workers treat the commune as their own, and peasants treat the factory as their own; workers going to the countryside "take the commune as their home," and peasants entering the city "take the factory as their home"; truly forming one family between factories and communes, and one family between workers and peasants. This is only what has been seen now, and there are more profound aspects that will reveal their potential in the future development of socialist construction!

    We need this spirit of "Bao" (contracting) and this style of "Bao" (contracting). This is a breadth of mind and spirit that takes the world as its responsibility, a high sense of responsibility that disregards everything for the cause of revolution, and the perseverance to work hard and diligently without fear of difficulties. We must promote this spirit and style of "taking care of it" in all work and all labor, taking care of difficulties and crushing them one by one; taking care of problems and solving them one by one; taking care of the long journey and completing it step by step. So that this spirit of the times can be carried forward by everyone, in this way, we will be invincible.

    成都量具刃具厂，是个全国闻名的新型工厂。在总路线的光辉照耀下，他们创造了一整套中国气派和中国作风的社会主义企业管理制度。这是已经为许多同志特别是工业部门的同志所熟知的了。
    在支援农业和农业技术改造这一件大事上，成都量具刃具厂也创造了一套做法。两年来，这个厂帮助金堂县、灌县以及成都市郊区等地，建立机械厂、肥料厂、酒精厂等和小型水电站，支援全省几十万件工具和大量的电线、电动机、变压器，修理和制造了不少的机械设备，加工了很多零件、部件。他们采取了厂部对公社、车间对管理区（生产大队）、小组对生产队，层层负责，对口包干，人人动手的办法。如今，包，已经成为四川省各行各业支援农业的风气了。大厂包大县、中厂包中等县、小厂包小县。全省所有县社都有工厂和各行各业负责支援，没有一个空白点。
    人们常把大协作称作共产主义风格；把“把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”誉为崇高的品质；这些都是我们的时代精神。包，也正体现了这种时代精神。“你们有困难吗？我们包下了！”“你们需要什么？我们包下了！”请听，这就是我们的英雄的工人阶级的声音，它落在地上，也是叮叮当当的。“包下了”，是件轻而易举的事吗？是吆喝一声就能实现的吗？不，决不。工人们在说这么一句话的时候，他们完全知道它的份量，也完全明白前面有什么样的困难在等待着。也许是原材料有问题，也许是工具有问题，也许是劳动力有问题，也许是时间有问题……总而言之，他们知道这“包下来”并不是一件轻松的事。然而，这又怎么样呢？难道英雄的工人阶级会被这些问题牵住吗？难道又有什么东西能阻碍工农弟兄的手足深情吗？请看，这朵“包下来”的共产主义之花，结出了丰硕的果实：工农友谊越来越巩固了；工人把社当成自己的社，农民把厂当成自己的厂，工人下乡“以社为家”，农民进城“以厂为家”；真正形成了厂社一家，工农一家。这还只是现在已经看到的，还有更深远的，将在今后社会主义建设的发展过程中显露它的头角呢！
    我们需要这种“包”的精神，“包”的风格。这是一种以天下为己任的胸怀和气概，为革命事业一切在所不顾的高度责任感，不怕困难、埋头苦干的毅力。我们要在一切工作、一切劳动中，都发扬这种“包下来”的精神和风格，把困难包下来，一个一个地粉碎它；把问题包下来，一个一个地解决它；把万里长途包下来，一步一步地走完它。使得这种时代精神，在每个人身上发扬光大，这样，我们就会无往而不胜了。
