Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Telegram – Xinjiang's wheat harvest is rapidly unfolding from south to north. In Turpan County, where harvesting began earlier, 40% of the wheat has already been harvested. In the Hotan region, over 80% of leaders at all levels and the labor force have gone to the front lines of the wheat harvest, and are now advancing at a rate of 150,000 mu per day.

The area sown with winter and spring wheat in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region this year is much larger than last year, and the crops are generally growing well. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, various localities began preparations for the summer harvest as early as two months ago, focusing on repairing and manufacturing semi-mechanized harvesting and threshing equipment. The Kashgar region prepared 660,000 pieces of harvesting and threshing tools of all sizes before the wheat harvest. Among them, all the wheat in many communes in Bachu, Shache, and Yingjisha counties will be harvested with various semi-mechanized agricultural implements. When the wheat harvest began, people's communes everywhere comprehensively arranged the use of labor, livestock, and machinery, as well as the order of harvesting, according to the wheat's maturity and the physical strength of the members. In Turpan County, the communes formed wheat harvesting shock teams composed of young men, specializing in harvesting, while women and the elderly formed groups to rake the fields and pick up wheat ears, following closely behind, which not only accelerated the harvesting progress but also ensured the quality of the harvest.

With the start of the wheat harvest, workers, cadres, medical personnel, commercial personnel, and urban residents in various localities, under the unified leadership of the local leading departments, rushed to the front lines of the wheat harvest to help the people's communes with the harvesting and to serve the broad masses of commune members. In Lop County alone, more than 250 medical personnel went to the front lines of the wheat harvest. In order to ensure that the broad masses of commune members live better during the intense summer harvest, the public canteens of the people's communes have made arrangements for meals, and many canteens have increased the variety of dishes to more than ten.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram – The wheat-producing areas of Shanxi Province are concentrating their efforts on a blitz to harvest wheat. The Jinan Plain, where harvesting began earliest, has been basically completed, the Jin Southeast region has entered the final stages, and the Jinzhong area is in the midst of a major harvest. According to recent statistics, two-thirds of the province's wheat has already been harvested.

The characteristics of this year's wheat harvest in Shanxi Province are the participation of the whole people, an early start, rapid action, and good cooperation. Various localities have adopted the method of "one place acts, multiple parties support," concentrating forces to rush the harvest and threshing. In the Jinan area, the labor force invested in the summer harvest reached more than 900,000 people, of which the labor force supporting from industry, commerce, and schools, and cooperating between regions, reached 188,000. The Taigu harvester has been widely used in the wheat harvest. In the Jinan region alone, more than 8,000 Taigu harvesters and other harvesting machines were used this year. According to statistics from the Jin Southeast region, various harvesting machines in the entire region undertook one-third of the total harvesting tasks this year. This not only accelerated the progress of the wheat harvest but also saved a large amount of labor.

As soon as the wheat harvest began, the people's communes, mainly with children, organized a capable "Grain to the Granary Corps" to pick up wheat behind the harvesting army, achieving front harvesting and back picking, side transportation and side picking. Now, areas where the wheat harvest has ended have launched a re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign, striving to return every grain to the granary. According to statistics from nine counties, including Yuncheng, Linyi, and Wanrong, the labor force participating in the re-harvesting and re-threshing has reached 185,000 people, and more than 16 million catties of wheat have been threshed.

    新疆麦收由南向北迅速展开
    山西集中力量突击割麦已收获过半
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆麦收已由南向北迅速展开。开镰较早的吐鲁番县，已收割小麦40％。和田专区80％以上的各级领导干部和劳动大军已到麦收第一线，现在正以日割十五万亩的速度向前挺进。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年冬、春小麦种植面积比去年扩大很多，而且普遍生长良好。为了确保小麦丰产丰收，各地早在两个月以前就以修理制造半机械化收、打机具为中心，展开了夏收准备工作。喀什专区在麦收前准备了六十六万件大小收打工具。其中巴楚、莎车、英吉沙等县许多公社的全部小麦将用各种半机械化农具收割。麦收开始时，各地人民公社都按照小麦成熟情况和社员体力强弱，全面安排了劳力、畜力和机械的使用以及收割次序。吐鲁番县各公社由青年小伙子组成麦收突击队，专管收割，妇女和老年人组成耙麦田和拾麦穗小组，随后紧跟，既加快了收割进度，又保证了收割质量。
    麦收开始，各地工人、机关干部、医务人员、商业人员和城市居民，在当地领导部门统一领导下，纷纷赶赴麦收前线，帮助各人民公社抢收和为广大社员服务。仅洛浦县深入到麦收第一线的医务人员就有二百五十多人。为了保证广大社员在紧张的夏收中生活得更好，各人民公社的公共食堂都对伙食作了安排，许多食堂的饭菜花样都增加到十多种。
    据新华社太原电　山西省各产麦区集中力量突击收麦。开镰最早的晋南平原已经基本收完，晋东南专区已经进入扫尾阶段，晋中地区正在大收。据最近统计，全省小麦已经收割了三分之二。
    山西省今年麦收的特点是全民上阵，开镰早，行动快，协作好。各地都采取了一处行动，多方支援的办法，集中力量，抢收抢打。晋南地区投入夏收的劳动力达到九十多万人，其中工、商、学等行业支援的和各地区之间协作的劳动力就达十八万八千多人。太谷号收割机在收麦中得到广泛使用。仅晋南专区今年使用的太谷号收割机和其他收割机械就有八千多台。据晋东南专区统计，全专区各种收割机械今年担负的收割任务，占到总任务的三分之一。这样不仅加快了麦收进度，还节约了大批劳力。
    麦收一开始，各人民公社就以少年儿童为主，组织了精干的“颗粒还仓团”，在麦收大军后边拾麦，做到了前割后拾，边运边拾。现在，麦收结束的地区又开展了复收复打工作，力争粒粒归仓。据运城、临猗、万荣等九个县统计，参加复收复打的劳动力已达十八万五千人，已经多打出小麦一千六百多万斤。（附图片）
