Sharing Information, Unified Action, Jointly Encircle and Annihilate
Sichuan's Various Regions Jointly Prevent and Control Pests and Diseases
Santai County Continuously Improves the Quality of Indigenous Pesticides to Enhance Pest Control Effects

(By Our Newspaper) Sichuan Province, in preventing and controlling crop pests, has broken regional boundaries and implemented joint prevention and control between special districts, counties, and communes. The entire province is divided into four large joint prevention zones, which are further divided into many small joint prevention zones. Regions participating in joint prevention exchange pest information at any time, take unified action, and cooperate closely. Yuechi and Tongnan are neighboring counties in different special districts, and they frequently exchange information and jointly encircle and annihilate pests. Tongnan County obtained rice stem borer information from Yuechi County and implemented early prevention, and the rate of dead-heart rice has now dropped to below 1%.

Special districts, counties, and communes participating in joint prevention also carried out inspections, evaluations, and friendly competitions in the spirit of "competing and helping," and provided mutual support in terms of manpower, materials, and technology. Wenjiang and Leshan special districts recently sent representatives to inspect the effectiveness of summer pest control, identified weak links, and immediately organized forces to make a concentrated attack. Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and Pingchang counties, which are currently engaged in a pest control competition, jointly proposed the conditions of "no missed patches, no missed blocks, no missed rows, no missed plants, no missed leaves," learning from each other, encouraging each other, and controlling pests according to high standards, striving for an all-round bumper harvest. Neijiang Special District, an old cotton-growing area, not only helped new cotton-growing areas such as Jiangjin and Luzhou special districts train plant protection technicians, but also sent people to impart pest control technology.

The temperature in Sichuan Province was relatively high last winter and this spring, and the mortality rate of pests was low. In the previous period, drought occurred in some areas, and rice stem borers, corn borers, and sweet potato hawk moth caterpillars multiplied rapidly. Recently, continuous rainfall, high temperatures, and humidity have led to the occurrence of pink bollworm in cotton fields.

In order to eliminate pests before they harm crops, all regions, on the basis of early prevention and frequent control, have advanced victoriously and launched several concentrated battles to annihilate pests, protect the healthy growth of major spring crops, and strive for an all-round bumper harvest.

(By Our Newspaper) Santai County, Sichuan Province, which has won the national red flag for the production of indigenous pesticides for two consecutive years, has further implemented the principle of combining popularization with improvement this year, strengthening refining, purification, and scientific research, continuously improving the quality of pesticides, and actively creating new varieties.

From January to June this year, Santai County has produced more than 73 million jin of indigenous pesticides. Due to the abundance of pesticides, the entire county has carried out four mass pest control campaigns under the principles of early treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment, ensuring that summer crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and autumn crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and cotton, which are currently in the growing and management period, have generally received three to eight treatments. Due to the effective suppression of pests and diseases, the 490,000 mu of wheat harvested this summer recovered more than 10 million jin of grain from diseases.

In order to further and effectively eliminate pests, Santai County is vigorously improving the quality of indigenous pesticides. At present, indigenous pesticide research institutions have been established from the county to the commune level, and industrial, agricultural, commercial, and scientific research departments have been organized to conduct pesticide collaborative experiments and cultivate more than 3,000 mu of collaborative experimental fields. They focus on wheat rust, rice and corn stem borers, rice blast, sweet potato tortoise beetle, cotton aphids, red spider mites, pink bollworms, and wilt, which have seriously harmed local crops in previous years. They widely use local wild herbs and mineral raw materials for field experiments, indoor experiments, and chemical analysis. Then, from the large number of successfully manufactured indigenous pesticides, they select those with abundant raw materials, great effects, low costs, and current urgent needs for refining and purification, so that "native soil produces foreign goods" and large-scale production is carried out.

Now, the number of indigenous pesticides that have been successfully tested and experimented with through resource surveys and multi-party trials in the county has increased from the original 261 to 837. According to the Sichuan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 205 of them have the conditions for mass production and widespread promotion, and 51 of them have reached the standards of highly effective pesticides. For example, the Wanbaoquan pesticide, which has been widely promoted in the county, is made of lime-sulfur mixture, herbal medicine, plus a small amount of cottonseed oil soap, kerosene, and DDT. It has a very good effect on preventing and controlling large areas of rice stem borers, rice blast, as well as wheat, sweet potatoes, cotton and other diseases. Each jin of this medicine can be diluted (mixed with water) more than 1,000 times, and the cost is only five or six fen. Treating one mu of land costs only one jiao, the price is low, and it is easy to transport and store.

    互通情报　统一行动 合力围歼
    四川各地联合防治病虫害
    三台县不断改进土农药质量提高治虫效果
    本报讯　四川省在防治作物虫害中打破地区界限，实行专区与专区、县与县、公社与公社的联合防治。全省划分成四个大联防区，以下又分成许多小联防区。参加联防的地区随时交换虫害情报，统一行动，密切协作。岳池与潼南是不同专区的邻县，经常互通情报，合力围歼害虫。潼南县从岳池县得到螟虫情报，便及早防治，目前水稻枯心率已下降到1％以下。
    参加联防的专区、县、社还本着又赛又帮的精神，开展了检查、评比和友谊竞赛，并在人力、物力和技术上相互支援。温江、乐山两专区最近互派代表检查夏季灭虫的效果，发现薄弱环节，立即组织力量突击。目前正在开展治虫竞赛的通江、南江、巴中、平昌四县，共同提出了“片不漏块、块不漏行、行不漏株、株不漏叶”的条件，互相学习，互相激励，按高标准防治虫害，力争全面丰收。老棉区内江专区除帮助江津、泸州专区等新棉区培训植物保护技术人员外，还派人前往传授防治虫害的技术。
    四川省去冬今春气温较高，害虫死亡率低。前段时期部分地区发生旱象，水稻螟虫、玉米钻心虫和甘薯猪儿虫繁殖较快。最近连续降雨，高温多湿，棉田发生红铃虫。
    为了把害虫消灭在危害作物之前，各地在及早预防、经常防治的基础上乘胜前进，先后多次展开了歼灭害虫的突击战，保护大春作物健壮生长，力争全面丰收。
    本报讯　连续两年获得全国土农药生产红旗的四川省三台县，今年进一步贯彻普及与提高相结合的方针，加强精制提纯和科学研究，不断提高农药质量，并积极创制新品种。
    今年三台县从1月到6月，已生产土农药七千三百多万斤。由于农药多，保证了全县在提早治、连续治、彻底治的方针下，开展了四次全民性的治虫突击运动，使全县小麦、油菜等夏收作物，和目前正在生长管理期间的水稻、红苕、棉花等秋熟作物，都普遍受到了三次到八次的防治。由于有效地打击了病虫害，今年夏收的四十九万多亩小麦，就从病害中夺回了一千多万斤粮食。
    为了进一步有效地消灭虫害，三台县正大力提高土农药的质量。目前，从县到公社都相继成立了土农药研究机构，同时组织工业、农业、商业与科学研究等部门大搞农药协作试验，种植了三千多亩协作试验田。他们针对历年危害本地农作物严重的小麦锈病、水稻、玉米螟虫、稻瘟病、红苕金花虫、棉花蚜虫、红蜘蛛、红蛉虫、枯萎病等，广泛利用本地野生草药和矿物性原料进行田间试验、室内试验和化学分析，然后在大量制造成功的土农药中，选择原料多、效果大、成本低和当前急需的加以精制提炼，使土中出洋，成批进行生产。
    现在全县通过资源调查和多方试制实验成功的土农药，已由原来的二百六十一种增加到八百三十七种，经中国科学院四川分院鉴定，有二百零五种已具备了成批生产，普遍推广的条件，其中有五十一种达到了高效农药的标准。例如全县已经大量推广使用的万宝全农药，是用石硫合剂、草药，再加少量棉油皂、煤油、滴滴涕制成的，对防治大面积水稻螟虫、稻瘟病、以及小麦、红苕、棉花等病害的效果都很好。这种药每斤可稀释（兑水）一千多倍，成本仅五、六分钱，治一亩地药只一角多钱，价格既低，又便于运输和储存。
