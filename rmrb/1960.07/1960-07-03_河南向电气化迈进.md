Henan Marches Towards Electrification
Yu Ji

In Henan, whether in the mountains or on the plains, one can see many small hydroelectric power stations, thermal power stations, and power stations. In many areas, electric poles stand like forests, and electric wires are intertwined. The province has already established a total of 16,368 power stations and power stations, including more than 3,200 power stations, with an installed capacity of more than 85,700 kilowatts. Eight hundred and fifty-one people's communes use electricity for irrigation, driving machines to process feed, gin cotton, extract oil, and for lighting. The ideal that farmers have longed for for years, "lighting lamps without oil," is beginning to become a reality.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Henan Province has achieved bumper harvests in agricultural production year after year, the scale of water conservancy construction has been unprecedentedly expanded, community-run industries have developed rapidly, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fisheries have all leaped forward in an all-round way. Everywhere, labor is needed. In order to solve the shortage of labor and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, the broad masses urgently demand the development of electricity and power to replace human and animal power. Considering that Henan is rich in hydropower and coal resources, and that community-run industries have greatly developed in recent years, and that the technical conditions for manufacturing a large number of equipment have been basically met, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a mass movement to run electricity.

In the early stage of the movement, some people felt that electricity was invisible and intangible, very mysterious, and unattainable; some emphasized that technical and equipment conditions were insufficient, and believed that there was no way to do it; others, although they wanted to run electricity every day, only wanted to do big and foreign things, and looked down on small and indigenous things. However, most people felt that running electricity was a practical need for the current development of production and an urgent demand of the masses. Whether it was indigenous or small, as long as it could reduce the heavy physical labor of the masses and improve labor productivity, it was good. They relied on the masses, relied on their own efforts, used indigenous methods, used local materials, learned technology themselves, found materials themselves, and manufactured equipment themselves, and vigorously engaged in the movement to run electricity with the concerted efforts of the masses. The areas that did this quickly established a large number of small power stations, which greatly overcame the difficulties of labor shortage and power shortage. The Provincial Party Committee promptly summarized these advanced experiences, grasped the typical cases of running electricity in Xinzheng, Lushi and other places, and greatly encouraged the broad masses of cadres and people through on-site meetings, touring visits and other forms, and strengthened their confidence in running electricity.

According to the specific conditions of Henan, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the policy of "hydropower as the main, small-scale as the main, community-run as the main, indigenous methods as the main, and serving production as the main" for running electricity. The whole province quickly launched a mass movement to run electricity by adapting to local conditions and seeking power from water, fire, wind, and biogas. Many counties made full use of water energy and adopted the method of building stations wherever there was a drop, and creating a drop where there was no drop, and built many grape-bunch-style power stations. Fugou County adopted methods such as damming and storing river water, raising the water level, building gates section by section, combining stations and gates, building dikes upstream, and digging canals downstream to create a drop, and built 104 hydropower stations and water power stations with an installed capacity of 3,300 kilowatts. Shenqiu County established 442 biogas supply stations while running electricity, taking more than 23,000 cubic meters of biogas per day, forming a dotted biogas network.

In the process of running electricity, the broad masses gave full play to their creativity and initiative. If there was no technology, they adopted methods such as inviting people in, sending people out, learning from those who are capable, and learning while doing; if there were no machines, they built indigenous equipment themselves; if there were no materials, they purchased waste materials and used a large number of substitutes. Many people took out copper and iron utensils that were not needed and copper coins that had been buried for decades in order to run electricity. In one year, a total of more than 2.6 million kilograms of waste copper, more than 10 million kilograms of iron sheet and miscellaneous iron, and 170,000 cubic meters of wood were purchased. The weavers of the Xindian Commune Machinery Factory in Xinzheng County, who had never manufactured generators before, have already learned and worked, overcome difficulties one after another, and used simple methods to make 25-kilowatt and 75-kilowatt generators. Now, many county and commune factories have been able to manufacture 100-kilowatt to 750-kilowatt indigenous generators and more complex generators and water turbines. Through the mass movement to run electricity, the province has also newly trained more than 50,000 technicians who have a preliminary understanding of power station construction, equipment manufacturing, and motor installation.

In the mass movement to run electricity, from the province to the county, electricity-running command headquarters and offices were established at all levels, and the communes and teams also had special personnel responsible. Many prefectural and county party committee secretaries personally led the masses to trial-produce generators. The secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee took the lead in running electricity, making the lighting electricity for the prefectural party committee organs and nearby organs self-sufficient, which effectively promoted the electricity-running movement in the entire prefecture. With the development of the movement, leaders at all levels also promptly organized visits and learning, organized special forces to conduct roving inspections and guidance, and constantly held on-site meetings and evaluation meetings, inserted red flags, and set up pace-setters to promote advanced experience, so that the mass movement to run electricity developed wave after wave. Taking the county party committee secretary as the head, Lingbao County successively organized four evaluation and inspection meetings, setting off a competitive upsurge of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping", and in just over two months, it built 90 power stations and power stations with a motor capacity of more than 3,200 kilowatts.

Tens of thousands of small power stations and power stations are rapidly changing the production and living conditions in rural areas, greatly improving the labor conditions in rural areas, and promoting the technological transformation of agriculture and the development of industrial and agricultural production. Now, heavy labor such as grinding flour, cotton ginning, oil pressing, and pumping water for irrigation in many communes has been widely replaced by electricity and water power. After Lushi County built more than 600 power stations, all 44 county and commune industrial enterprises and agricultural and sideline product processing used electricity, and more than 4,300 mu of high land realized electric pumping irrigation, greatly saving labor and promoting the development of agricultural production. According to statistics from Xuchang and Xinyang prefectures alone, 311 communes' organs, schools, public places, and 270,000 households have installed electric lights. Many villages have installed wired broadcasting and radios, and some have also established lighted ball fields. After work, farmers can happily go to canteens and classrooms to learn culture and carry out entertainment activities, enriching the cultural life of rural areas and making people more full of confidence in the beautiful scenery of electrification.

    河南向电气化迈进
    豫辑
    在河南，无论在山区或是平原，都可以看到许多小型的水电站、火电站和动力站。不少地区电杆林立，电线交织。全省已经建立起来的电站、动力站共有一万六千三百六十八处，其中有电站三千二百多处，装机容量达八万五千七百多瓩。有八百五十一个人民公社利用电力灌溉，带动机器加工饲料，轧花，榨油和照明。多少年来，农民们向往的“点灯不用油”的理想开始变为现实。
    从1958年大跃进以来，河南省农业生产连年丰收，水利建设规模空前扩大，社办工业迅速发展，农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进，到处都需要劳动力。为了解决劳动力的不足，加速农业的技术改造，广大群众迫切要求发展电力、动力，代替人力、畜力。中共河南省委考虑到河南水力资源和煤炭资源丰富，近几年来社办工业有了很大的发展，机械制造能力有了显著增长，大量制造设备的技术条件已基本具备，决定开展一个群众办电运动。
    运动初期，有一部分人觉得电是看不见、摸不到的东西，很神秘，高不可攀；有的强调技术、设备等条件不足，认为没法办；另一种人虽然天天想办电，但是只愿搞大的、洋的，看不起小的、土的。但是大部分人感到办电是当前发展生产的实际需要，是群众的迫切要求，不管土的，还是小的，只要能够减少群众的笨重体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，都是好的。他们依靠群众，自力更生，土法上马，就地取材，技术自己学，材料自己找，设备自己造，群策群力的大搞办电运动。这样办的地区，很快就建立了大批的小型发电站，在很大程度上克服了劳力不足、动力缺乏的困难。省委及时总结了这些先进经验，抓住新郑、卢氏等地办电的典型事例，通过现场会议、巡回参观等形式，大大地鼓舞了广大干部和群众，坚定了他们的办电信心。
    省委根据河南的具体情况，提出了“水力为主，小型为主，社办为主，土法为主，服务生产为主”的办电方针。全省很快掀起了一个因地制宜，向水、火、风、沼气要动力的群众办电运动。许多县充分利用水能，采取有落差就建站，无落差就人造落差的办法，建成很多葡萄串式的电站。扶沟县采取拦蓄河水、抬高水位，节节建闸、站闸合一，上游培堤、下游挖渠等方法制造落差，建起水电站和水力站一百零四处，装机容量达三千三百瓩。沈丘县在办电的同时，建立了四百四十二个沼气供应站，日取沼气二万三千多立方米，形成了星罗棋布的沼气网。
    在办电过程中，广大群众发挥了创造性和主动精神。没有技术，就采取请进来、派出去、能者为师、边学边干等办法学习技术；没有机器就自己大造土设备；没有材料，就收购废料，大量采用代用品。许多群众为了办电，把用不着的铜铁器具和埋藏数十年的铜钱拿出来。一年之间共收购到二百六十多万斤废铜，一千多万斤铁皮、杂铁，十七万立方米木材。过去没有制造过发电机的新郑县辛店公社机械厂的织工，已经边学边做，连破难关，用简易的办法制成了二十五瓩和七十五瓩的发电机。现在，许多县、社工厂，已经能制造一百瓩至七百五十瓩的土发电机和构造比较复杂的发电机、水轮机。经过群众办电运动，全省还新培养出五万多初通电站建筑、设备制造、电机安装的技术人员。
    在群众办电运动中，从省到县，层层建立了办电指挥部和办公室，社、队也有专人负责。不少地委和县委书记亲自领导群众试制发电机。新乡地委书记带头办电，使地委机关和附近机关的照明用电，做到了自给自足，有力地促进了全专区的办电运动。随着运动的发展，各级领导还及时组织参观学习，组织专门力量巡回检查指导，并且不断召开现场会、评比会，插红旗、树标兵，推广先进经验，从而使群众办电运动一浪高一浪地向前发展。灵宝县以县委书记为首，先后组织了四次评比检查，掀起了“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛热潮，在短短的两个多月中，就建成电站、动力站九十处，电机容量达三千二百多瓩。
    上万座小型电站、动力站，正在迅速改变着农村的生产面貌和生活面貌，大大改善了农村的劳动条件，促进了农业技术改造和工农业生产的发展。现在，许多公社磨面、弹花、榨油、抽水浇地等笨重劳动，已经广泛被电力和水力所代替。卢氏县建起六百多座电站以后，四十四个县、社工业企业和农副产品加工全部使用了电力，四千三百多亩高地实现了电力抽水灌溉，大大节约了劳动力，促进了农业生产的发展。仅据许昌、信阳两个专区的统计，已有三百一十一个公社的机关、学校、公共场所和二十七万户居民安上了电灯。许多村庄安装了有线广播和收音机，有的还建立了灯光球场。农民们在劳动之余，可以愉快地到食堂和课堂学习文化，开展娱乐活动，丰富了农村的文化生活，使人们对电气化的美景更充满了信心。
