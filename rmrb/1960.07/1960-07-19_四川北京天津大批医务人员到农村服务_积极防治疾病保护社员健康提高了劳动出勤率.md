Sichuan, Beijing, Tianjin send large numbers of medical personnel to serve in rural areas
Actively prevent and cure diseases, protect the health of commune members, and improve labor attendance rates

    (Our report) Sichuan Province has mobilized more than 110,000 medical personnel to go deep into the countryside, actively prevent and treat diseases, protect the health of commune members, and vigorously support the sustained leap forward in agricultural production. Now, every commune in the province has a hospital, every management district has a health center, and every production team has a health worker, nursery worker, and midwife, forming a medical and health care network centered on the commune hospital. According to statistics from January to June of this year, effective treatment of hookworm disease and other diseases has restored the health of a large number of patients, adding the equivalent of more than one million laborers to the province's agricultural front. At the same time, the incidence of major infectious diseases such as dysentery, malaria, diphtheria, and encephalitis has also decreased by more than 90% compared to the same period last year, greatly increasing the rural labor attendance rate.
    According to the instruction of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee that "the busier the production, the more necessary it is to do a good job in health work to protect the health of the labor army," since last winter and this spring, the Party committees and health departments at all levels in Sichuan Province have mainly focused on three aspects of work: vigorously promoting collectivized health work; vigorously preventing and treating hookworm disease and schistosomiasis; and mobilizing the masses to promote hygiene and eliminate the four pests. In just over half a year, the province has treated a large number of schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and other diseases that affect production. In the work of public canteens, on the one hand, great efforts have been made to improve canteen hygiene facilities, establish separate stoves, sand filter tanks, running water hand and dishwashing sinks, and fly and dust-proof covers; on the other hand, strengthen canteen hygiene management, establish hygiene systems, and conduct universal training for cooks and canteen managers to improve their hygiene knowledge and cooking skills. Many places have also established new-style double-pit public toilets in canteens to prevent flies and hookworm disease, greatly changing the environmental sanitation. In collective field production, it is generally ensured that workers bring their own teapots and do not drink raw water. Many places have also established mobile toilets and provide cool drinks and heatstroke prevention facilities in summer. All kinds of care are also given to women and the sick and weak when adjusting work.
    Due to good hygiene, many places have no infectious diseases all year round, and attendance is full. According to statistics from Leshan Prefecture, there are more than 11,400 management districts and nurseries and kindergartens without infectious diseases. In many health advanced areas of the province, the labor attendance rate is as high as 95% or more, which has greatly promoted agricultural production.
    In the work of vigorously protecting the rural labor force, the province has transferred more than 110,000 medical personnel to go deep into the vast rural areas, implement a method combining professional teams and mass movements, participate in labor while preventing and treating diseases, publicize health knowledge, and train rural health workers, nursery workers, cooks, and feed workers, etc., to help establish primary medical institutions. Nanchong and Jiangjin prefectures alone have trained more than 180,000 health backbones such as cooks and nursery workers, enabling them to master methods for treating major current diseases. At present, more than 34,000 primary medical and health care institutions have been established in rural areas throughout the province, forming a medical and health network centered on commune hospitals and closely integrated with production organizations. Currently, a total of more than 30 million people in the province are participating in this movement to eliminate pests and diseases and protect the labor force.
    (Our report) A large number of medical personnel in Beijing have gone deep into the rural areas of the suburbs to vigorously support agricultural production and have made remarkable achievements.
    Since this spring, many medical units in Beijing have fully cooperated with rural primary medical organizations, going deep into production teams to carry out medical activities. Medical personnel from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and teachers and students from Beijing Medical College and Beijing Municipal Health School helped 200,000 commune members in Changping County conduct general surveys of diseases such as trachoma, dental caries, dysentery, bronchitis, and gastric ulcers, and treated diseases such as trachoma, endemic goiter, and dysentery. More than 10,000 trachoma patients have been cured.
    In addition to going to the countryside to carry out medical treatment and publicity activities, the Beijing medical community also takes turns going to county, district, and commune hospitals, adopting methods that combine systematic and single-subject advanced studies, schools and training courses, and on-the-job and spare-time advanced studies to train medical personnel for communes. After medical personnel from the China-Soviet Friendship Hospital went to Liangxiang People's Commune, they trained more than 17,000 primary health personnel and mass health activists for the commune and established 52 health clinics and 205 Red Cross health stations. So far, urban medical units have trained a total of more than 100,000 primary health personnel for rural areas. The rapid growth of the health team has powerfully promoted the rural health movement. While improving the medical level of existing primary medical personnel, the counties and communes in the suburbs also adopted methods such as sending doctors and nurses to municipal hospitals for further study, sending experienced doctors from municipal hospitals to teach at the grassroots level, and running health schools and short-term training courses to systematically train and improve medical cadres. With the help of Tongren Hospital, Daxing County Hospital has newly established departments such as ophthalmology, tuberculosis, pediatrics, and radiology on the basis of the original four departments of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and traditional Chinese medicine. Many commune hospitals have basically achieved that minor illnesses can be treated within the commune, and major illnesses can be treated within the district or county, reducing the trouble of transfers, saving time, reducing the suffering of patients, and improving the attendance rate of commune members.
    In order to further support agricultural production, medical units in Beijing organized a second batch of more than 800 medical personnel on the 16th of this month to go to the front line of vegetable production in the suburbs of Beijing to carry out medical and health care work.
    (Xinhua News Agency) Fourteen hospitals in Tianjin have selected medical and nursing personnel with relatively high technical levels to provide technical guidance to county hospitals in stages and batches to support agricultural production. Yang Ke, a gynecology expert and president of the Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, went to Renqiu County and Ba County hospitals several times to perform surgical demonstrations and treat difficult and complicated diseases. Zhai Tianfu, deputy director of surgery at the First Central Hospital, and other department directors often lectured the medical staff of Cang County Hospital on the latest medical technologies. The medical personnel sent down also held various training courses to train nursing staff, pharmacists, and laboratory technicians for county hospitals. At the same time, the county hospitals also selected medical personnel with relatively high technical levels to go to the municipal hospitals with which they were paired for further study. In the past year, more than 100 medical personnel sent by the county hospitals for further study have reached the level of attending physicians, resident physicians, or head nurses.
    Medical personnel in Tianjin also train farmer health workers for rural people's communes. The Second Hospital has trained more than 70 health backbones for the communes in Ningjin County who can diagnose and nurse general diseases. Medical personnel from the Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital have carried out women's labor protection work in Hejian, Renqiu, and Ba counties. They also trained more than 500 health workers for the communes and production teams in these three counties through methods such as apprenticeship and on-site teaching.
    With the enthusiastic help of municipal hospitals, the medical technology level and hospital management work of the county hospitals have been rapidly improved. Many surgeons in county hospitals have learned more than a dozen relatively complex surgeries such as gastrectomy and cholecystectomy.

　　四川北京天津大批医务人员到农村服务
　　积极防治疾病保护社员健康提高了劳动出勤率
    本报讯　四川省先后动员十一万多名医务人员深入农村，积极防治疾病，保护社员的健康，有力地支援了农业生产的持续跃进。现在，全省每一个公社都有医院，管理区有保健所，生产队有卫生员、保育员和助产员，形成一个以公社医院为中心的医疗保健网。据今年1月至6月的统计，由于对钩虫病等各种疾病的有效治疗，使大批病人恢复健康，已为全省农业战线增加了相当于一百万个以上的劳动力；同时，痢疾、疟疾、白喉、脑炎等主要传染病的发病率，也比去年同期下降90％以上，使农村劳动出勤率大大提高。
    根据中共四川省委“生产愈忙，愈需要搞好卫生工作，以保护劳动大军健康”的指示，去冬今春以来，四川省各级党委和卫生部门主要抓住了三个方面的工作：大搞集体化卫生工作；大力防治钩虫病、血吸虫病；发动群众大讲卫生，大灭四害。仅仅半年多时间，全省治疗了大量的血吸虫病、钩虫病、血丝虫病以及其他影响生产的疾病。在公共食堂工作上，一方面大搞食堂卫生设施，建立隔壁灶、沙滤缸、流水洗手洗碗槽、防蝇防尘罩等；一方面加强食堂卫生管理，建立卫生制度，并对炊事员、食堂管理员普遍进行训练，提高了他们的卫生知识和烹调技术。许多地方还以食堂为单位建立新式的双坑公共厕所，防止苍蝇和钩虫病，大大改变了环境卫生面貌。在田间集体生产中，一般都作到提壶上工、不喝生水，不少地方还建立了流动厕所，夏天有清凉饮料和防暑设施。对于妇女、病弱者，调工时也作了种种照顾。
    由于卫生搞得好，许多地方常年无传染病，出工满堂红。据乐山专区统计，已出现无传染病的管理区和托儿所、幼儿园一万一千四百多处，全省许多卫生先进地区的劳动出勤率高达95％以上，对农业生产起了很大的促进作用。
    在大力保护农村劳动力的工作中，全省抽调了十一万多名医务人员，深入广大农村，实行专业队与群众运动相结合的办法，一边参加劳动，一边防治疾病，一边宣传卫生常识，一边培训农村保健员、保育员和炊事员、饲料员等，帮助建立基层医疗机构。仅南充、江津两专区就已训练了十八万多名炊事员、保育员等卫生骨干，使他们掌握了治疗当前主要疾病的办法。现在，全省农村已建立基层医疗保健机构三万四千多个，形成了以公社医院为中心，与生产组织紧密结合的医疗卫生网。目前，全省共有三千多万人参加这一除害灭病、保护劳动力的运动。
    本报讯　北京市大批医务人员深入郊区农村，大力支援农业生产，已做出显著成绩。
    今春以来，北京许多医疗单位与农村基层医疗组织全面协作，深入生产队，展开医疗活动。中国医学科学院医务人员和北京医学院、北京市卫生学校师生帮助昌平县二十万社员进行了砂眼、龋齿、痢疾、气管炎、胃溃疡等疾病的普查，并对砂眼、地方病甲状腺肿、痢疾等疾病进行了治疗。已治愈砂眼患者一万多人。
    北京医务界除到农村进行医疗和宣传活动外，还轮流到县、区、公社医院，采取系统与单科进修相结合、学校与训练班相结合、脱产与业余进修相结合等办法，为公社培养医务人员。中苏友谊医院的医务人员到良乡人民公社后，为这个公社培训了初级卫生人员和群众卫生积极分子一万七千多名，并建立五十二个保健室、二百零五个红十字卫生站，到目前为止，城市医疗单位为农村培训的初级卫生人员已共达十万多人。卫生队伍迅速壮大，有力地推动了农村的卫生运动。在提高现有基层医务人员医疗水平时，郊区各县社还采取了派医生、护士到市级医院留学，市级医院派有经验的医生到基层来教，和办卫生学校、短期训练班等办法，有计划地培养提高医务干部。大兴县医院在同仁医院的帮助下，在原有的内、外、妇产、中医四科的基础上，新建立了眼科、结核科、小儿科、放射科等科室。许多公社医院已基本上做到小病不出社，大病不出区、县，减少了转院的麻烦，节省了时间，也减少病人的痛苦，提高了社员出勤率。
    为了进一步支援农业生产，北京市各医疗单位于本月16日又组织了第二批巡回医疗共八百多名医务人员，分赴京郊蔬菜生产第一线，开展医疗和卫生保健工作。
    据新华社讯　天津市十四个医院分别选派了技术水平较高的医护人员，分期分批地到县医院进行技术指导，支援农业生产。妇科专家、中心妇产科医院院长杨珂，几次到任丘县和霸县医院作手术示范，治疗疑难病症。第一中心医院外科副主任翟天福和其他科主任医生，经常给沧县医院的医务人员讲授最新的医疗技术。派下去的医务人员还举办各种训练班，为县医院培训护理人员、药剂师和化验员等。同时，各县医院也选派了技术水平较高的医务人员到挂钩的市医院进修，一年来，各县医院先后派来进修的一百多名医务人员，已分别达到主治医生、住院医生或护士长的水平。
    天津市医务人员，还为农村人民公社培训农民卫生员。第二医院为宁津县各公社培养了七十多名能诊断与护理一般疾病的卫生骨干力量。中心妇产科医院的医务人员在河间、任丘、霸县开展了妇女劳动保护工作，他们还以师傅带徒弟、现场教学等方式，为这三个县的公社和生产队培训了卫生员五百多人。
    各县医院在市内医院的热情帮助下，医疗技术水平和医院管理工作都迅速提高。很多县医院的外科医生学会了胃切除、胆囊摘除等十几种比较复杂的手术。
