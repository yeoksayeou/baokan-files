    Ningming County Uses Rice Transplanters on a Large Scale for Late Rice
    Over 230,000 Mu of Late Rice Transplanted, of Which Machine Transplanting Accounts for 67%

    (Our dispatch) The summer harvesting and planting season in Ningming County, Guangxi, has entered its final stage. Currently, on the vast fields of this county, more than 3,480 rice transplanters are planting late rice seedlings row by row. As of July 18th, over 234,000 mu of late rice had been transplanted, of which machine transplanting accounted for more than 67% of the total transplanted area.
    This year, the area planted with late rice in this county has increased by 70,000 mu compared to last year, and the actual labor force投入 into summer harvesting and planting has decreased by more than 10,000 people compared to last year. However, due to the large-scale use of rice transplanters, the efficiency of transplanting has improved, saving approximately one labor day per mu compared to manual transplanting. Therefore, the transplanting progress is still much faster than last year. During the busy "double搶" period last year, the daily transplanting progress in the county was generally more than 27,000 mu; this year, the daily transplanting progress during the busy period reached more than 36,000 mu, an increase of 33% compared to last year. Over 157,000 mu of machine-transplanted fields generally have uniform rice clumps, consistent transplanting depth, and good quality standards. Moreover, they turn green faster than manually transplanted fields.
    In promoting the use of rice transplanters, this county continuously delves into solving the ideological problems of cadres and commune members. For the 62,000+ mu of early and mid-season rice transplanted by machines, vigorous summaries and publicity were carried out based on comparisons of the speed and quality of manual versus machine transplanting, comparisons of seedling growth, and yield comparisons. This eliminated ideological concerns among some people who believed that machine transplanting was not as fast or as good as manual transplanting, fearing damage to seedlings, missed seedlings, poor seedling growth, and inability to increase production. The prestige of rice transplanters was established among the majority of cadres and commune members. However, when late rice transplanting began, new ideological problems arose. Some said that using rice transplanters for one or two hours was acceptable, but not for the whole day; transplanting one or two mu was acceptable, but not large areas, as carrying the machine back and forth in small plots was too time-consuming; irrigated fields were suitable, but dry fields were not; large fields were suitable, but small fields were not suitable as carrying the machine back and forth was too time-consuming; early and mid-season rice were acceptable, but late rice fields with more rice stalks were not suitable, and so on. In short, some people believed that rice transplanters could not be used for late rice. Thus, an even more intense ideological struggle began. When Baima Brigade of Xiashi Commune started transplanting late rice, some people believed that the early rice stalks had just been turned over, and there were many rice roots in the field, so rice transplanters could not be used. The brigade organized a competition between machine transplanting and manual transplanting, using two plots of land with an area of ​​five fen each, one transplanted manually and the other transplanted by machine. Nong Cailan and more than 30 others spent 20 minutes to manually transplant, while 6 people used machines to transplant only 15 minutes. Three days later, due to inconsistent transplanting depths, floating and dead seedlings reached 15% in the manually transplanted field, while machine-transplanted seedlings grew neatly and began to turn green. This comparison proved that late rice can also be transplanted by machines, and people eliminated their concerns and scrambled to use rice transplanters. Was it true that small plots could not be transplanted with rice transplanters? Liu Ming, the secretary of the Chengzhong Commune Party Committee, took 11 people and 3 rice transplanters to select 6 mu of land, consisting of 13 plots, in the Daludong of Beidou Brigade to test the use of rice transplanters. Although it took some time to move the machines, it only took more than 3 hours to transplant. If it were manually transplanted, at a rate of 7 fen of land per person per day, 6 mu of land would take nearly a day. The commune members said convincingly: small plots are also faster to transplant by machines. Can rice transplanters transplant continuously and on large areas? In order to eliminate this doubt and explore the experience of using rice transplanters for long periods of time in large areas, in mid-June, the Ningming County Party Committee convened a county-wide rice transplanter usage competition meeting in Chengzhong Commune. This competition was not a performance for one or two hours, but a zoned and labeled continuous large-scale transplanting for several days. Through the competition meeting, many cadres and commune members eliminated their doubts about rice transplanters transplanting continuously and on large areas. After the meeting, all cadres and commune members in the county, both men and women, learned to use rice transplanters, and everyone strove to become a machine operator. More than 3,480 rice transplanters in the county were投入 into the urgent transplanting of late rice, setting off a machine transplanting craze.
    During the early rice transplanting season, Ningming County manufactured more than 3,400 Guangxi 59-3 type rice transplanters, but they did not pass the technical test and were of poor quality. In order to improve the quality of rice transplanters, the County Party Committee concentrated 816 iron and carpenters in the three areas of Munan, Chengzhong, and Haiyuan, and adopted the method of master teaching apprentices to conduct a period of technical training, and then returned to the communes to serve as manufacturing and modification work. In manufacturing, the county's two state-owned agricultural machinery factories and the agricultural machinery factories of each commune specifically divided the work according to their technical level and equipment capabilities, effectively ensuring the specifications and quality of the main parts of the rice transplanters.
    Having good rice transplanters requires skilled operators to fully exert the power of the rice transplanters. Therefore, the County Party Committee attached great importance to the work of training rice transplanter operators. Before late rice transplanting, the county had successively trained 11,977 rice transplanter operators, of which 5,314 met the "four abilities" standards of knowing how to use, repair, explain and promote, and maintain. After training a large number of rice transplanter operators, specialized rice transplanter teams were organized at all levels from the county to the commune and brigade, with the first secretary of the Party Committee at each level serving as the captain.
    In order to effectively lead the work of manufacturing and promoting rice transplanters, the County Party Committee issued the call of "early rice as a student, mid-season rice as an expert, and late rice as a teacher," requiring the secretaries of Party organizations at all levels to learn how to use and repair rice transplanters. Responding to the call of the County Party Committee, secretaries at the county, commune, and brigade levels, as well as the vast number of cadres, actively投入 themselves into the upsurge of learning how to use rice transplanters. Because leading cadres dug into it, a series of key issues from the manufacturing to the use of rice transplanters, from labor organization to work point remuneration, were resolved in a timely manner. This is an important guarantee for the smooth development of the work of mass manufacturing and promotion of rice transplanters in Ningming County.

    解决思想问题　提高机具质量　培养插秧机手
    宁明县大面积晚稻使用插秧机
    已插晚稻二十三万多亩其中机插面积占67％
    本报讯　广西宁明县的夏收夏种已进入最后阶段。目前，在这个县辽阔的田野上，三千四百八十多架插秧机正在把晚稻秧苗一排一排地插下去。到7月18日止，已插下的二十三万四千多亩晚稻，其中机插面积占全部已插面积的67％强。
    这个县今年晚稻比去年扩大了七万亩，实际投入夏收夏种的劳动力比去年减少了一万多人，但由于大量使用插秧机，插秧效率提高，每插一亩大约比手插节约一个劳动日，因此插秧进度仍然比去年快得多。去年双抢大忙期间，全县插秧日进度一般为二万七千多亩；今年大忙期间的插秧日进度达到三万六千多亩，比去年提高了33％。十五万七千多亩机插田，普遍秧蔸均匀，插得深浅一致，规格质量好，而且比手插的转青快。
    在推广使用插秧机中，这个县不断地深入解决干部、社员的思想问题，对于六万二千多亩机插的早、中稻，从手插和机插的好快对比、禾苗生长对比以及产量对比等方面，大力进行总结、宣传，消除了一些人认为机插不如手插快、不如手插好、怕伤秧、漏秧多、禾苗生长不好和不能增产等思想疑虑，在广大干部、社员中树立起插秧机的威信。但是，到了晚稻插秧开始的时候，又产生了新的思想问题，说什么用插秧机插一、两小时可以，成天插不行；插一、两亩可以，插大片不行；保水田可以插，旱田不行；大块田可以，小块田扛机来往费时多；早、中稻可以，晚稻田里禾秆多，插不得；等等。总之，有些人认为晚稻不能使用插秧机。于是一场更激烈的思想斗争开始了。夏石公社白马大队在开始插晚稻时，有人认为早稻禾秆刚翻下，田里稻根多，插秧机用不得。大队便组织了一次机插与手插的对比赛，用两块五分面积的田，一块手插，一块机插。农彩兰等三十多人用手插二十分钟插完，另外六个人用机插只插了十五分钟；三天后，手插田因插得深浅不一，浮秧、死秧达15％，而机插禾苗生长整齐，开始转青。这一对比证明晚稻同样能用机插，人们消除了顾虑，都争用插秧机插晚稻。是不是小块田不能用插秧机插？城中公社党委书记刘明带了十一个人和三架插秧机在北斗大队的大路垌选了六亩田，共十三块，试用插秧机插秧，虽然搬机费了些时间，也不过三个多钟头就插完了。要是用手插，以每人日插七分田计，六亩地需要将近一天的时间。社员们信服地说：小块田也是用机插快。插秧机能否连续插、大片插？为了消除这种怀疑，摸索在大面积上长时间地使用插秧机插秧的经验，6月中旬，宁明县委在城中公社召开了全县插秧机使用比赛会。这次比赛不是表演一两个钟头，而是划区挂牌连续大插几天。通过比赛会，许多干部、社员对于插秧机连续插、大片插的疑虑都解除了。会后，全县干部、社员，男男女女，人人学习使用插秧机，个个争当机插手，全县三千四百八十多部插秧机投入晚稻抢插，掀起了机插的热潮。
    在早稻插秧时节，宁明县曾制造了三千四百多架广西59—3型插秧机，但是没有过好技术关，质量差。为了提高插秧机质量，县委在睦南、城中、海渊三个片，集中了八百一十六名铁木工，采取师傅带徒弟的办法，进行了一个时期的技术训练，然后回到各公社担任制造、改装工作。在制造中，全县的两个国营农械厂和各公社的农械厂，根据技术水平和设备能力具体分工，有效地保证了插秧机主要零件的规格质量。
    有了好的插秧机，还要有操作熟练的机手，才能充分发挥插秧机的威力。因此，县委很重视训练插秧机手的工作。晚稻插秧前，全县已先后培养训练了一万一千九百七十七名插秧机手，其中达到会使用、会修理、会讲解宣传、会保养等“四会”标准的有五千三百一十四名。在培训出大批插秧机手后，从县到公社、大队，层层组织了插秧机专业队，由各级党委第一书记当队长。
    为了切实领导好制造推广插秧机的工作，县委发出“早稻当学生，中稻当能手，晚稻当教师”的号召，要求各级党组织书记都要学会使用和修理插秧机。响应县委号召，县、公社、大队三级书记以及广大干部积极投入学习使用插秧机的热潮。由于领导干部钻了进去，使插秧机从制造到使用，从劳动组织到工分报酬等等一系列的关键问题，都及时得到解决。这是宁明县大量制造推广使用插秧机工作获得顺利开展的重要保证。
