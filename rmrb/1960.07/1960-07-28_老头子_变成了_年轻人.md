"Old Man" Becomes "Young Man"
Cai Lianxing, Driver Chief of the Mao Zedong Locomotive, Fengtai Locomotive Depot

The history of the Jiefang (Liberation) type 304 locomotive is a history full of contradictions and struggles, a history of continuous replacement of old technologies with new ones.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the contradiction between railway transport capacity and transport volume has become increasingly prominent. To solve this contradiction, the state transferred a batch of the latest domestically produced Jianshe (Construction) type locomotives to our depot for use. The Jiefang type 304 locomotive is an old locomotive, and the domestically produced Jianshe type is a new locomotive. Comparatively, the new locomotive pulls more and runs faster, while the old locomotive pulls less and runs slower. After this contradiction between the new and old locomotives, between more and faster and less and slower, emerged, all the workers in the depot were very concerned and worried about the honor of our old 304 locomotive. This locomotive had been the national locomotive banner and maintained the honor of an advanced locomotive for the past fourteen years. However, with the arrival of the new Jianshe type locomotives, this old locomotive lagged far behind, and its honor became difficult to maintain. Under these circumstances, two different ideas emerged: Some comrades said, "The 'old man' can't beat the 'young man' no matter what. Let's replace it. The Jiefang type locomotive should go to the history museum." However, the majority of comrades insisted on using technical transformation methods to resolve the contradiction between the new and old locomotives, so that the old Jiefang type locomotive could catch up with or surpass the new Jianshe type locomotive. Under the leadership of the Party, we applied Chairman Mao's teachings, "The dialectical world outlook teaches people primarily how to observe and analyze the movement of contradictions in various things and, based on this analysis, point out the methods for resolving contradictions" ["On Contradiction"], and summarized the development history of the Jiefang type 304 locomotive. We first recalled that this locomotive was created fourteen years ago, in the early days of liberation, when the working class, in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, revived a dead locomotive through strenuous repairs. With the needs of socialist construction, small-scale technical transformations were continuously carried out, increasing the locomotive's traction force from 800 tons to 2,700 tons, and its technical speed from 41.2 kilometers per hour to 49.6 kilometers per hour. Through this recollection, everyone was reminded that this locomotive was born in the struggle of contradictions in the past, and was constantly transformed and improved in the struggle of contradictions. Since this was the case in the past, why can't we overcome difficulties, give full play to our subjective initiative, and continue to develop the struggle of contradictions now? Didn't Chairman Mao tell us that the struggle of contradictions is the source of development of things? Didn't Chairman Mao say that the opposites of contradictions can transform into each other under certain conditions? Why can't backwardness be transformed into advancement? We can do it as long as we dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act.

Then everyone raised the second question: How can we make the backward Jiefang type 304 locomotive catch up with or surpass the advanced domestically produced Jianshe type locomotive? In the discussion, we recalled Chairman Mao's saying that "There is no right to speak without investigation," and realized that we must find out the characteristics of the Jianshe type locomotive, how it is different from the Jiefang type, and what contradictions exist between them. Only by revealing contradictions can we resolve them, so we must first conduct investigation and research to find out the contradictions. After careful investigation and research, we found that the Jianshe type locomotive has a large smoke box volume and good ventilation equipment, and a hot water pump, so the water entering the boiler is already at 90 degrees Celsius. The Jiefang type locomotive has a small smoke box volume and poor ventilation equipment, and the water entering the boiler is only 60 degrees Celsius. This difference (contradiction) in volume size and temperature level makes the Jiefang type locomotive lag behind the Jianshe type in traction capacity. Another difference is that the Jianshe type locomotive has a large valve intake port and cylinder exhaust port, so the force pushing the cylinder piston is strong; the Jiefang type has a small valve intake port and cylinder exhaust port, so the force pushing the cylinder piston is weak. This difference (contradiction) in size and strength makes the Jiefang type locomotive slower than the Jianshe type locomotive. In order to resolve these contradictions, under the leadership of the Party, with the strong support of fraternal units and the help of experienced masters in our factory, we carried out a relatively large-scale technical transformation of this old locomotive, expanded the smoke box volume, improved the ventilation equipment, and installed a hot water pump, increasing the locomotive's traction tonnage from the original 2,700 tons to 4,150 tons. In order to increase speed and enhance transport capacity, we also enlarged the valve intake port and cylinder exhaust port, increasing the locomotive's technical speed from the original 49.6 kilometers per hour to 69.4 kilometers per hour. With the increase in the locomotive's speed, further demands were made for technical innovations in automation and semi-automation. To meet this requirement, we conducted multiple experiments and finally created scientific projects such as the large axle temperature measuring instrument and the chloride content measuring instrument. Up to now, this old locomotive has undergone 108 technical transformations. In terms of locomotive performance, it has not only caught up with the Jianshe type locomotive, but has surpassed it.

Chairman Mao told us that under certain conditions, bad things can be turned into good things. Backwardness is a bad thing, and advancement is a good thing. Under certain conditions, backwardness can also be transformed into advancement. This is because backwardness and advancement are contradictory opposites, and they can transform into each other under certain conditions. The prerequisite for transformation is revolutionary drive and giving full play to subjective initiative. The entire history of the emergence and development of our Jiefang type 304 locomotive vividly and powerfully proves this truth. Therefore, as long as we earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and study Chairman Mao's works, we can turn backwardness into advancement and make the "old man" become a "young man."

    “老头子”变成了“年轻人”
    丰台机务段毛泽东号机车司机长　蔡连兴
    解放型304号机车的历史是一部充满着矛盾斗争的历史，是一部新技术不断代替旧技术的发展史。
    自1958年大跃进以来，铁路上运输能力和运输量之间的矛盾就越来越突出了。为了解决这个矛盾，国家把国产最新的建设型机车调一批给我们段上使用。解放型304号机车是旧机车，国产建设型是新机车，比较起来，新机车拉得多跑得快，旧机车拉得少跑得慢。这种新旧机车多快和少慢之间的矛盾出现之后，全段的工人都很关心，都为我们这辆304号旧机车的荣誉着急。因为这辆机车过去十四年一直是全国机车的旗帜‘长期保持了先进机车的荣誉。可是建设型新机车一来，这辆旧机车就远远落后了，荣誉也就难保了。在这种情况下，出现了两种不同的思想：有些同志说：“‘老头子’怎么也赛不过‘年轻人’。换一个吧，解放型机车该入历史博物馆了。”可是多数同志坚持用技术改造的办法来解决这个新旧机车的矛盾，使解放型的旧机车赶上或超过建设型的新机车。我们在党的领导下，运用了毛主席告诉我们的，“辩证法的宇宙观，主要地就是教导人们要善于去观察和分析各种事物的矛盾的运动，并根据这种分析，指出解决矛盾的方法”《矛盾论》，总结了解放型304号机车的发展史。我们首先回忆起这辆机车是在十四年前解放初期，工人阶级为了打垮蒋介石的反动统治，经过奋力抢修，使死机车复活而产生出来的。随着社会主义建设任务的需要，还曾经继续不断地进行小型的技术改造，机车的牵引力由八百吨提高到二千七百吨，技术速度由每小时四十一点二公里提高到四十九点六公里。通过这一段回忆，提醒了大家，这辆机车过去是在矛盾斗争中产生的，又在矛盾斗争中不断地改造、不断地完善起来的。既然过去是这样，为什么我们现在就不能克服困难、高度发挥主观能动性、使矛盾斗争继续向前发展呢？毛主席不是告诉我们矛盾的斗争是事物发展的源泉吗？毛主席不是说过矛盾的对立面在一定的条件下能够相互转化吗？落后为什么不能变为先进呢？只要我们敢想敢说敢干就能作到。
    接着大家就提出了第二个问题：怎么样才能使落后的解放型304号机车赶上或超过先进的国产建设型机车呢？在讨论中，我们想起了毛主席说的“没有调查研究就没有发言权”那句话，认识到必须找出建设型机车的特点，它和解放型有什么不同？它们之间有什么矛盾？只有揭露矛盾才能解决矛盾，因此必须先进行调查研究，找出矛盾。经过细心调查研究之后，我们发现建设型机车烟箱容积大，通风装置好，有热水泵，水进锅炉之前温度就已经达到了摄氏九十度；解放型机车烟箱容积小，通风装置不好，水进锅炉之前只有六十度，这种容积大小，温度高低之间的不同（矛盾），就使解放型的机车牵引能力落后于建设型。另一个就是建设型机车气门进气口和气缸的排气口大，推动气缸活塞的力量强；解放型的气门进气口和气缸排气口小，推动气缸活塞的力量弱。这种大小、强弱之间的不同（矛盾）就使解放型机车的速度不如建设型机车快。为了解决这些矛盾，我们在党的领导下，在兄弟单位的大力支持和本厂老师傅的帮助下，对这辆旧机车进行了比较大型的技术改造，扩大了烟箱的容积，改善了通风装置，安装了热水泵，使机车的牵引吨数在原来二千七百吨的基础上提高到四千一百五十吨。为了提高速度和增强运输能力，又改大了气门的进气口和气缸的排气口，使机车的技术速度，在原来每小时四十九点六公里的基础上提高到六十九点四公里。机车的速度一提高，进一步提出了自动化和半自动化方面的技术革新的要求。为了适应这个要求，我们又经过多次的试验，终于制成了大轴测温仪和含氯量测定仪等科学项目。到目前为止，这辆旧机车已经进行了一百零八项技术改造。在机车性能上不仅赶上了建设型的机车，而且超过了它。
　　毛主席告诉我们，在一定的条件下，坏事可以变成好事。落后是坏事，先进是好事，在一定的条件下落后也能变为先进，这是因为落后和先进是矛盾的对立面，它们在一定的条件之下是可以互相转化的，而转化的先决条件，就是革命干劲，就是高度发挥主观能动性。我们解放型304号机车整个产生和发展的历史，生动有力地证明了这条真理。因此，只要我们认真学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作，就能变落后为先进，使“老头子”变成“年轻人”。
