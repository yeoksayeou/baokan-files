Leaving the Office, Going Deep into the Front Lines
Taiyuan, Lanzhou, and Wuxi Cadres Go to the Grassroots to Solve Key Problems

    (Our report) Taiyuan – All levels of government, factories, and enterprises in Taiyuan City are universally implementing the "One, Two, Three" work system. The broad masses of cadres are going deep into the production front lines, participating in production, and leading production.

    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the current new situation in production, requires that the work of all departments be done more meticulously and solidly, ensuring that the broad masses of cadres have more time to go deep into the grassroots to discover and solve key problems in production in a timely manner. Therefore, it has proposed the implementation of the "One, Two, Three" work system, which will guarantee that cadres spend one day a week studying, two days working in the office, and three days going deep into the grassroots.

    Since the implementation of this system in all levels of government, factories, and enterprises throughout the city, it has achieved good results. Li Qi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Zhang Qixiang, Secretary of the Secretariat, have gone deep into factories and mines such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Jinxi Machine Factory to direct production on the production front lines and help solve major practical problems in their work. The Secretary of the Party Committee and the Manager of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, as well as factory-level leading cadres, have moved their offices into the factory workshops, dividing up areas and setting up fixed points, going deep into the furnace front, and vigorously developing "experimental plots." They are using the method of "dissecting sparrows" to lead production, quickly breaking through weak links in production. The No. 3 furnace of the No. 1 Steel Plant, which pioneered three-tap steelmaking, has, due to the presence of leading cadres at the furnace front, reduced the average smelting time in June by four hours compared to May, and steel production has increased by 15% compared to the same period last month.

    (Our report) Lanzhou – The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is implementing the "One, Two, Three" work system. The secretary is taking the lead in going deep into the production front lines, participating in and leading production, and contracting "experimental plots" by area. This has promoted a great improvement in the work style of cadres throughout the city, pushing the current industrial production and technical revolution movement to a new high.

    The main content of the "One, Two, Three" work system is: one day for study; two days for meetings to summarize work; and three days to go deep into the production front lines. In the past month or more, the responsible cadres of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have conscientiously implemented this system. Of the five secretaries and six standing committee members in charge of production, except for one who was away on official business, the others have all been contracting areas and systems, moving to the site to work and squatting at the grassroots to supervise and spur on. All departments, bureaus, factories, and enterprises have also streamlined their organizations and strengthened the grassroots, with a large number of cadres going to the production front lines. At the same time, it is stipulated that meetings should be strictly controlled and the quality of meetings should be improved. Some major issues are resolved through on-site meetings or workshop meetings. The Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee also moves to the site to discuss special issues. It is also required that documents and reports should not be easily issued to lower levels.

    Because leading cadres have enough time to go deep into grassroots enterprises, they can promptly discover and solve key production problems. This year, all undertakings in Lanzhou are leaping forward, and workers have made many creations and innovations. The 605 Factory has created a new experience in saving coal. The Secretary of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally convened an on-site meeting to quickly promote this experience in nearly two hundred enterprises and institutions throughout the city, which can generally save 20%-40% of coal. Ma Yingwu, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee and Director of the Municipal Construction Committee, personally grasped the backward enterprises such as brick and tile production, vigorously grasping the production of semi-finished brick and tile products, so that the Shajingyi Brick and Tile Factory, which had been unable to complete the state plan, has achieved a leaping progress. Since mid-June, the daily output of semi-finished brick billets has been maintained at more than one million pieces, an increase of more than 70% compared to the past.

    The great improvement in the leadership style of the Municipal Party Committee has promoted greater involvement of the broad masses of grassroots cadres in actual work. According to preliminary statistics, more than 60% of the cadres in the city's industrial enterprises have now gone to the production front lines to participate in and lead production.

    (Our report) Wuxi, Jiangsu – Wuxi, Jiangsu, is universally promoting the "Three-Three System" leadership method. The content of this leadership method is: one-third of the cadres go deep into key enterprises, participate in labor, help grassroots cadres summarize experience, and specifically solve problems in production and work; one-third of the cadres go to factories for on-site inspection to help general factories research and solve some major problems; and one-third of the cadres stay in the office to handle routine affairs.

    In early June, after the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly proposed the universal implementation of the "Three-Three System" in the city, the municipal and district agencies organized more than 600 cadres in total, and went to factories separately. For example, among the more than 80 cadres of the Metallurgical Bureau, except for one-third staying in the office to handle routine affairs, the two bureau directors led 28 cadres to go deep into four units: the steel plant, smelting plant, coking plant, and Huaxin Coking Plant, to lead production on site; the remaining more than 20 cadres were led by the Secretary of the Metallurgical Party Committee and another bureau director to other factories for on-site inspection. The cadres working in the factory eat, live, work, and consult with the workers; the cadres and the masses get along well, and solve some major key problems in production in a deep and meticulous manner. Yu Junwen, Director of the Metallurgical Bureau, who was stationed in the Wuxi Coking Plant, went deep to the front of the Red Flag Coking Oven, participating in labor on the one hand and talking with the workers on the other, and found out that the key to the low output of the coking oven was that there were too many empty holes. Therefore, it was further discovered that there was confusion in the work, such as not paying attention to the maintenance of rolling scrap and coal washing equipment, resulting in low efficiency and insufficient supply of refined coal. In response to this reason, Yu Junwen consulted with grassroots cadres and took measures to improve the efficiency of rolling scrap and coal washing to solve this key problem, so that the daily output of coke increased from more than 170 tons to more than 200 tons.

    After the implementation of the "Three-Three System" leadership method, it also promoted the municipal and district leadership organs to better improve their work, reduce meeting reports and incoming and outgoing documents, and improve work efficiency.

    走出办公室　深入第一线
    太原兰州无锡机关干部到基层去解决关键问题
    本报讯　太原市各机关、厂矿、企业普遍推行“一、二、三”工作制度，广大干部深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。
    中共太原市委根据当前生产的新形势，要求各部门的工作做得更细致、更扎实，保证广大干部有更多的时间深入基层及时发现和解决生产中的关键问题，因而提出实行“一、二、三”工作制度。它将保证干部在一周内有一天时间学习，两天时间在机关工作，三天时间深入基层。
    这项制度在全市各机关、厂矿、企业中推行以后，已获得了良好的效果。市委第一书记李琦和书记处书记张其祥已深入到太原钢铁公司、晋西机器厂等厂矿，到生产第一线指挥生产，帮助解决实际工作中的重大问题。太原钢铁公司党委书记、公司经理、厂级领导干部搬进了厂内车间办公，划片定点，深入炉前，大搞“试验田”，以“解剖麻雀”的办法领导生产，迅速突破了生产薄弱环节。首创三槽出钢的第一钢厂三号炉，由于领导干部深入炉前，6月份的冶炼时间比5月份平均缩短了四小时，钢产量比上月同期增长了15％。
    本报讯　中共兰州市委实行“一、二、三”工作制度，书记带头深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产、分片包干种“试验田”，从而推动了全市干部领导作风的大改进，把当前的工业生产和技术革命运动推向了新的高潮。
    “一、二、三”工作制度主要内容是：一天学习；两天开会，总结工作；三天深入生产第一线。最近一个多月以来，中共兰州市委的负责干部认真执行这个制度，五个书记和六个管生产的常委中，除一名因公外出外，其他的人都按片按系统包干，搬到现场办公，蹲基点督战。各部、局、厂矿企业也都紧缩机构，充实基层，大批干部走上了生产第一线。同时规定，严格控制会议，提高会议质量。有些重大问题，采取现场会师、车间会师的办法解决，市委常委会讨论专门问题也搬到现场去开。并要求不轻易向下发文件和表报。
    由于领导干部有足够的时间深入基层企业，就能及时发现和解决生产关键问题。今年兰州市各项事业都在跃进，职工的创造和革新很多。六零五厂创造了节约用煤的新经验，中共兰州市委书记就亲自召开现场会议，使这项经验很快在全市近二百个企业单位中推广，一般可节约煤20％—40％。市委常委、市建设委员会主任马英武亲自抓砖瓦生产等后进企业，大抓砖瓦半成品生产，使一直完不成国家计划的沙井驿砖瓦厂出现了跃进局面。6月中旬以来，半成品砖坯日产保持在一百万块以上，比过去提高70％还多。
    市委领导作风的大改进，促进了广大基层干部更加深入实际。据初步统计，目前全市工业企业已有60％以上的干部走上生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。
    本报讯　江苏无锡普遍推行“三三制”领导方法。这一领导方法的内容是：三分之一的干部深入重点企业，参加劳动，帮助基层干部总结经验，具体解决生产和工作中的问题；三分之一的干部下厂巡回检查，帮助一般厂研究、解决一些重大问题；三分之一的干部留在机关，处理日常事务。
    6月上旬，中共无锡市委明确提出在全市普遍推行“三三制”后，市、区机关一共组织了六百多个干部，分头下厂。如冶金局八十多个干部中，除三分之一留守机关处理日常事务外，两位局长带领二十八个干部，深入到钢铁厂、冶炼厂、焦化厂、华新炼焦厂四个单位，现场领导生产；其余二十多名干部，由冶金党委书记及另一局长带领到其它各厂巡回检查。下厂干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量；干部和群众打成一片，深入、细致地解决了生产上的一些重大关键问题。驻在无锡焦化厂的冶金局局长于骏文等深入到红旗炼焦炉前，一面参加劳动，一边和工人谈心，摸到了焦炉产量不高的关键，是空孔较多，因此又进一步发现工作上存在混乱现象，像不注意轧屑、洗煤设备的维修，使用效率不高，以致精煤供应不上。针对这个原因，于骏文就和基层干部商量，采取措施，提高轧屑、洗煤效率，解决这个关键，使焦的日产量从一百七十多吨上升到两百多吨。
      “三三制”的领导方法推行以后，还促使市、区领导机关更好地改进工作，减少会议报表和来往文件，提高工作效率。（附图片）
