　　Under the Nurturing of Urban People's Communes
　　—A Record of a Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory Founded by Three Watch Repair and Engraving Workers
　　By Our Correspondents Ji Jingru and Hu Zhongcai

　　"Our factory, which started from scratch, was a 'hand-out seeker' a year ago; now, it has become a 'hand-shaker.'" Wang Xinguo, the director of the Harbin Xiangfang People's Commune Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory, likes to use this sentence to illustrate the road their factory has traveled.

　　More than a year ago, this factory was founded by three watch repair and engraving workers. At that time, they had no equipment, no technology, and could only be a "hand-out seeker" when interacting with other factories. Now, they can not only produce fourteen kinds of products, such as safety transformers, current transformers, electric welding machines, and advanced electronic stethoscopes, to meet market needs, but also can specifically produce urgently needed electrical equipment for other factories to support their production. In March of this year, the state-owned Jiancheng Machinery Factory needed a large number of small DC and AC motors to manufacture a product, and the Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory quickly undertook this task, meeting the needs of the machinery factory. Several major automatic production lines of the Harbin Bearing Factory were urgently waiting to be put into production and urgently needed thirty-five electromagnets, which were also rushed out by their factory, saving the bearing factory from emergency. Therefore, now they are no longer simply "hand-out seekers," but a "hand-shaker" with back-and-forth exchanges. How can three watch repair and engraving workers run such an electrical appliance factory? This cannot but mention the role of the Great Leap Forward and the urban people's communes.

　　Inspiration from Electric Toys

　　During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party called on all the people to run industries, and residents of Harbin streets and various industries set up various small factories for sand casting, machinery, iron smelting, and bearings. "Can we set up a factory to produce small motors and contribute to the country's industrialization?" Several handicraft workers Wang Xinguo and Zhang Jiyu from the Xiangfang Watch Repair and Engraving Cooperative discussed together. After some research, they bought several pamphlets on electrical knowledge and studied them together. One day, they saw a child's toy "electric windmill." Zhang Jiyu, who loves to use his brain, immediately thought that this toy might have the same points as the motor driven by the windmill, so the three people brought this toy back as if they had found a treasure. They regarded this "electric windmill" toy as a living "blueprint," dismantled its rotating parts, and carefully explored the role of each part with the mood of repairing clocks. At the same time, they found silicon steel sheets and copper wires, cut them open in the same way, and wrapped copper wires layer by layer. After a lot of effort, it was made, but it would not rotate when connected to electricity. What should be done?

　　At this time, Harbin held an exhibition of technological innovation and technological revolution, which exhibited the masses' diverse creations and inventions. Wang Xinguo, Zhang Jiyu and others were quickly attracted by this exhibition. They drilled into the "electrical appliance hall" and looked at the structure, principle, use, and even installation of the various motors displayed, asking questions to get to the bottom of everything. Back, they used the principles they learned to improve the trial-produced motor. This time, when it was sent for testing again, the small motor, which had been carefully studied for a month, really spun.

　　With the successful trial production of the small motor, they wanted to put it into production as soon as possible, so they tried to raise funds to borrow equipment such as punching machines. However, after running around to many places, they could not get a punching machine. At this time, an old electrician gave them a suggestion: start by manufacturing "safety transformers." This kind of electrical appliance was very much needed at that time, and the equipment was relatively simple, requiring only a few hand-operated presses and winding machines.

　　They accepted the electrician's suggestion, bought a transformer, and disassembled it to study its structure and principle. As the saying goes, "understanding one thing leads to understanding everything." With the experience of studying the motor last time, they immediately understood it at a glance, and quickly trial-produced a "safety transformer," which was successfully tested at the central substation. Later, with the support of the local Party committee, they borrowed several hundred yuan and bought five hand-operated presses and four winding machines. In this way, the Xiangfang Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory, founded by three watch repair and engraving workers, was born.

　　However, with only three workers, how could they produce in batches? The Xiangfang People's Commune happened to be established at this time. Thousands of housewives broke free from the shackles of housework and took up production posts. The family members of the members of the Xiangfang Watch Repair and Engraving Cooperative—Wang Shuhua, Hou Shufang, Li Xianglan, Zhao Jie, and other sixteen housewives—were the first to enthusiastically support this new small factory and became the first batch of workers in the Xiangfang Commune Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory. The three watch repair and engraving workers and the handicraft workers Wang Muduo, Li Huixiu, and Zhang Lifang, who were transferred from the radio repair cooperative, were considered their "masters." They groped together, and in just ten days, they produced the first batch of "National Day gift" products—fifty "safety transformers."

　　Finding Wisdom Among the Masses

　　The moving story of the three watch repair and engraving workers of the Xiangfang People's Commune running an electrical appliance factory attracted thousands of visitors from all over the country. And what first attracted the people who came to the electrical appliance factory were the various machines with ingenious structures and high work efficiency created by the workers themselves. There were no blueprints for manufacturing these machines. According to the workers, they were all thought out with their brains based on production needs.

　　Why are these workers so good at thinking? This has a lot to do with their past occupations of repairing clocks and radios. Taking Zhang Jiyu, one of the three founders of the electrical appliance factory, as an example, he started learning to repair clocks at the age of sixteen. The professional accomplishment made him interested in almost everything in life that uses machinery: a child was playing next to the street pulling a toy car, and every time the wheel turned, the wooden man on the car would clap his hands. When Zhang Jiyu saw it, he stopped to study the structure of this toy car. The construction site installed a power device for transporting red bricks, and when Zhang Jiyu saw it, he carefully observed how many teeth this gear wheel had? And what is the relationship between that gear wheel and this gear wheel. He closely linked these inspirations he observed anytime and anywhere with production and worked with other workers to create and innovate various equipment. In the past, the factory used saw blades to pull the screw cap openings, which required fifteen or sixteen female workers every day, which was both labor-intensive and wasteful of saw blades. At the beginning, Zhang Jiyu created a mouth milling machine with manual feeding based on the principle of a bicycle chain driving the gear wheel. Later, he visited the automated production line of the measuring tool and cutting tool factory and wanted to convert the mouth milling machine into automatic feeding. But after several attempts, it was not successful. What was the reason? One worker said: "Maybe there is a problem with the number of teeth on the gear wheel. Would it work to change the number of teeth to an 'even number'?" This suggestion made Zhang Jiyu think of the clock parts he used to play with. "Aren't the gear teeth of clocks all even numbers? Moreover, there is a certain ratio between the teeth of each gear wheel." He stared at the watch on his wrist, ran over to count the gear wheels of the mouth milling machine, and found that some of the teeth were odd and some were even, and they were not "in proportion" to each other. No wonder it could not automatically control feeding regularly. After the reason was found, the automatic feeding mouth milling machine was quickly made. The female workers who pulled the saw blades cheered: This is great, we don't have to strain our arms anymore!

　　In this way, every key in production would become a topic for Zhang Jiyu and the workers of this factory to create or innovate equipment. Since the establishment of the commune electrical appliance factory a year and a half ago, Zhang Jiyu and the workers have jointly created and innovated various equipment and tools such as "aluminum plate rolling machine," "electric sawing machine," and "screw cutting machine," totaling more than twenty kinds. He also worked with other workers to study, from trial production of transformers to trial production of current transformers, electric welding machines, small motors, etc., so that the factory developed from producing only one product at the time of establishment to being able to produce fourteen products.

　　Now, this ordinary watch repair worker, Zhang Jiyu, has become the director of the electrical appliance factory's technological revolution office, was rated as a provincial and municipal labor model, and honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Wang Xinguo, who founded this factory with Zhang Jiyu, also joined the Party and served as the director of this factory. Other handicraft workers who were transferred from the watch repair or radio repair cooperative in the early days of the factory's establishment have also grown into the factory's production section chiefs, trade union or Communist Youth League branch responsible cadres, or workshop directors.

　　From Housewives to Electrical Technicians

　　With the development of the Xiangfang Commune Electrical Appliance Factory, a new female workforce is constantly growing on the electrical industry front. When the factory was first established, there were only sixteen female workers, but now it has increased to more than four hundred and fifty (accounting for about 70% of the total number of factory workers). A year and a half ago, most of them had never even heard of what a "current transformer" was. Now, when you walk into the "March 8th" workshop that produces current transformers, you will see hundreds of female workers skillfully operating punching machines, electric drills, winding machines, etc. for production. The entire set of processes for these current transformers, from cutting materials, drilling holes, winding wires, insulation... to installation, are all undertaken by the female workers of the "March 8th" workshop. Most of these female workers are women with many children. Before the urbanization of the city's communes, although they also wanted to participate in work, there were no street factories nearby; they were a little too old to enter large factories as apprentices. So when they heard that the people's commune's electrical appliance factory needed labor, everyone was really happy. Hou Shufang, the leader of the winding group of the electrical appliance factory and a city red banner pacesetter, was one of the first female workers to participate in production. At that time, the urban communes had just been established, and nurseries had not yet been established in large numbers. Hou Shufang decided to entrust someone to take care of her child and participate in work herself. She said to her husband: "Even if all my salary is used to pay for the child's childcare fees, I will work as long as I can enter the factory to produce!" She entered the electrical appliance factory with this determination. At first, although she didn't understand any technology, she diligently studied hard and quickly mastered various technologies such as punching, winding, and installation, becoming a "red banner" for all the female workers in the factory. Wang Shuhua, the leader of the downline group of the small motor workshop and a mother of four children, entered the factory with Hou Shufang. Because she breastfed her child several times a day, she could not keep up with her partners when she first learned to wind wires. At noon, everyone went home to eat, but she brought her meal to the workshop, hurriedly finished eating, and took the time to learn to wind wires. Even on the way home at night, she gestured the winding action with her hands. In this way, she caught up with the speed of other female workers in a few days. Soon, she mastered all the technologies of all processes for producing current transformers. In March of this year, the factory sent her to the Electrical Engineering College to learn the downline coil technology of small motors. After returning, she served as the leader of the downline group of the small motor workshop.

　　There are many female workers in the Xiangfang Commune Electrical Appliance Factory who diligently study production and quickly master production technology like Wang Shuhua and Hou Shufang. Now, all sixteen female workers who entered the factory in the first batch have mastered the entire set of technologies for producing "current transformers" and "transformers" and have become the backbone of various workshops. Many female workers who entered the factory later have also rapidly improved their production technology with the enthusiastic help of the workers who entered the factory earlier. In the first half of this year, about one hundred female workers were rated as "red banner pacesetters" in the factory because of their outstanding achievements in production.

　　The female workers of the electrical appliance factory poured all their energy into the factory's production and cared about the factory in all aspects. Hou Shufang, the leader of the winding group, was thinking day and night about how to mechanize the winding process. Sometimes she talked about technological innovation in the factory in her sleep, and her husband said she "became a revolution fan"! In the factory's insulation group, there are eighteen female workers over forty years old. When they tied the cotton rope on the insulator, they tried their best to prevent the cotton rope from being wasted even an inch. Some old ladies said: "In order to save cotton rope, we are more careful when tying insulators than when we were tying flowers when we were girls!" This kind of love for the factory is naturally expressed in many ways. Once, a batch of new products was successfully trial-produced, and six or seven female workers, including Wang Shuhua, Hou Shufang, Li Xianglan, and Liu Enying, carried them to a factory with power electricity for finished product testing. On the way, it suddenly rained heavily. None of the people told each other to do so, but they all automatically took off their coats and wrapped them around the outside of the product. They would rather get rained on themselves than let the products they made with their own hands get wet by the rain.

　　It is precisely because of the new forces such as Zhang Jiyu, Hou Shufang, Wang Shuhua, and countless others who have grown up in the urbanization of city communes that the leap-forward development of small-scale urban commune industries has been promoted. Now, the Xiangfang Commune Daily-Use Electrical Appliance Factory, which started from three watch repair and engraving workers, has developed into a medium-sized factory with more than six hundred workers, more than one thousand square meters of factory buildings, and more than sixty pieces of equipment. The small motors, current transformers, and other electrical products they produce in batches are continuously supplying the needs of seventeen provinces and cities across the country and supporting the needs of agricultural technology transformation in Heilongjiang Province. At the same time, it also undertakes the production tasks of repairing various damaged motors for the Harbin Bearing Factory every month and undertaking the manufacture of electric vehicle parts for the state-owned Jiancheng Machinery Factory, becoming a powerful assistant in the great leap forward in large factories.

　　在城市人民公社抚育下
　　——记三个修表刻字工人创办的日用电器厂
　　本报记者　纪静如　胡钟才
    “我们这个白手起家的工厂，一年以前还是个‘伸手派’；现在，已经变成‘握手派’了。”哈尔滨香坊人民公社日用电器厂厂长汪新国，喜欢用这句话来说明他们工厂所走过的道路。
    一年多以前，这个工厂是由三个修表、刻字工人创办起来的。当时，他们没有设备，没有技术，和其他工厂发生关系时，只能做一个“伸手派”。现在他们不仅可以生产安全变压器、电流互感器、电焊机、高级电子听诊器等十四种产品，供应市场需要，而且可以专门为其他工厂生产急需的电器设备，支援他们的生产。今年3月，国营建成机械厂制造一种产品，需要大批的直流和交流的小型电动机，日用电器厂很快把这个任务承担下来，满足了机械厂的需要。哈尔滨轴承厂有几条主要的自动生产线急等投入生产，迫切需要三十五个电磁铁，也是他们厂给赶制出来，为轴承厂救了急。所以，现在他们再不是单纯的“伸手派”，而是一个有来有往的“握手派”了。三个修表、刻字工人怎么能办起这样一个电器厂呢？这就不能不说到大跃进和城市人民公社的作用了。
      电动玩具的启发
    1958年大跃进中，党号召全民办工业，哈尔滨街道居民、各行各业纷纷办起了翻砂、机械、炼铁、轴承等各种小工厂。“我们能不能办个生产小电机的工厂，也给国家工业化出一把力呢？”香坊修表刻字合作社的几个手工业工人汪新国、张季育等在一起议论着。经过一番研究，他们买来几本有关电气知识的小册子，一块儿钻研。一天，他们看到了一架孩子玩的“电动风车”玩具。最爱动脑筋的张季育立即联想到这个玩具可能和风车带动的电动机有相同的地方，于是三个人如获至宝地把这架玩具捧回来。他们把这架“电动风车”玩具当成了活的
  “图纸”，拆开它的转动部分，用他们修理钟表的心情，精细地探索着每个零件的作用。同时，找来矽钢片和铜线，照样剪开，又一层层缠上铜线。好容易做成了，可是，接上电不会旋转，这可怎么办呢？
    正在这时，哈尔滨市举办了一个技术革新、技术革命展览会，展出了群众五花八门的创造发明成果。汪新国、张季育等几个人，很快就被这展览会吸引住了。他们钻在“电器馆”里，把陈列出来的各种电机的结构、原理、用途，一直到安装，都追根究底地看了又看，问了又问。回来，再用学到的原理改进试制的电动机。这次再送去试验，这个经过一个月苦心钻研的小电机真的飞转起来了。
    小电机试制成功了，他们想早日投入生产，就设法筹借冲压机床等设备。可是跑遍了很多地方，也搞不到一台冲床。这时，一个电器老工人给他们提了个建议：先从制造“安全变压器”入手。这种电器当时非常需要，而设备又比较简单，只要几台手扳压力和绕线机就行了。
    他们接受了电器工人的建议，买了个变压器，又拆开来研究它的结构原理。真是俗话说的“一通百通”，有了上次研究电机时的经验，这次一看就开窍了，很快试制了一台“安全变压器”，送到中心变电所一试就成功了。以后，他们在当地党委的支持下，借了几百元资金，买了五台手扳压力和四台绕线机。这样，由三个修表刻字工人创办的香坊日用电器厂就此诞生了。
    可是，只有三个工人，怎样成批生产呢？香坊人民公社恰好在这时成立了。成千上万的家庭妇女摆脱家务羁绊，走上了生产岗位。香坊修表刻字合作社社员的家属——王淑华、侯淑芳、李香兰、赵杰等十六名家庭妇女，首先满腔热情地支持了这个新生的小工厂，成为香坊公社日用电器厂的第一批工人。三个修表、刻字工人和从无线电修理合作社转业过来的汪木铎、李会修、张励芳等手工业工人，就算是她们的“师傅”。他（她）们一起摸索着，短短十天时间，就把第一批“国庆献礼”产品——五十台“安全变压器”生产出来了。
      到群众里去找智慧
    香坊人民公社三个修表刻字工人大办电器厂的动人事迹，吸引着来自全国各地成千上万的参观者。而来到电器厂的人们，首先被吸引住的就是由工人们自己创造的结构巧妙、工效很高的各种各样机器。制造这些机器并没有图纸，依照工人们的说法，都是根据生产需要，用脑瓜想出来的。
    为什么这些工人这样会想呢？这和他们过去修理钟表、修理无线电的职业很有关系。以电器厂三个创办人之一的张季育为例，他从十六岁就学习修理钟表，职业的素养，使他几乎对生活中凡是运用机械的东西都发生兴趣：一个小孩牵着玩具车在街道旁边玩，车轮一转动，车上的木头人就连着拍手。张季育看见了，就停下来研究这辆玩具车的构造。建筑工地安装了运送红砖的动力装置，张季育看见了，就细心观察这个牙轮有几个齿？那个牙轮和这个牙轮又是什么关系。他把这些随时随地观察得来的启发，又密切地和生产联系起来，和其他工人们一起创制和革新各种设备。过去，工厂用锯条拉螺丝帽口，每天要十五、六个女工，既费劳力，又费锯条。开始，张季育根据自行车链子带动牙轮的原理创制出一台人工上料的铣口机。以后，他参观了量具刃具厂自动化生产线，又想把铣口机改成自动上料。但试了几次，都没有成功。究竟什么原因呢？有一个工人说：“可能是牙轮齿数有问题，把齿数改成
  ‘偶数’行不行呢？”这个建议使张季育想到了以前经常摆弄的钟表零件。“钟表的牙轮轮齿不都是偶数吗？而且各牙轮之间，轮齿都有一定比数”。他凝视一下戴在腕上的手表，跑过去一数铣口机的牙轮，发现有的齿数成单，有的成双，互不成“比数”，怪不得不能有规律地自动控制送料。原因找出来后，自动送料的铣口机很快就制成了。拉锯条的女工个个欢呼：这可好了，再也不用累酸胳膊了！
    就这样，生产中的每一个关键，都会成为张季育和这个工厂工人们创制或革新设备的课题。从公社电器厂成立一年半以来，张季育和工人们在一起共同创制和革新了“卷铝板机”、“电动锯床”、“切螺丝机”等各种设备、工具，共达二十几种。他还和其他工人一起钻研，由试制变压器到试制成电流互感器、电焊机、小型电动机等，使工厂由建立时只生产一种产品发展到能生产十四种产品。
    现在，这个普通修表工人张季育已经成了电器厂技术革命办公室的主任，被评为省、市劳动模范，光荣地加入了中国共产党。和张季育一起创办这个工厂的汪新国也入了党，担任了这个工厂的厂长。其他在建厂初期，先后由修表或无线电修理合作社转过来的几个手工业工人，也多已成长为这个工厂的生产股长，工会或共青团支部负责干部或车间主任等。
  从家庭妇女到电器技工
  随着香坊公社电器厂的发展，在电器工业战线上，一支新生的女职工队伍正在不断壮大成长。这个厂初建立时，只有十六名女职工，现在已增加到四百五十多名
  （占全厂职工总数70％左右）。在一年半以前，她们多是连什么叫“电流互感器”都没听说过的家庭妇女。现在，当你走进这个工厂生产电流互感器的“三八”车间，就会看到，成百名的女职工，正熟练地操纵着冲压机、电钻、绕线机等进行生产。这些电流互感器，从断料、钻眼、绕线、绝缘……直到安装等全套工序，都是由“三八”车间女职工们承担的。这些女职工大部分是多子女的妇女。在城市公社化以前，她们虽也想参加工作，但附近没有街道工厂；进大工厂当学徒吧，年纪又稍大了一些。所以当她们听说人民公社的电器厂需要劳动力时，大家真是高兴极了。电器厂绕线组长、市红旗手侯淑芳，是第一批参加生产的女职工。那时，城市公社刚成立，托儿所还没大量兴办起来。侯淑芳决心把孩子托人照管，自己参加工作。她和丈夫说：“哪怕我的工资全部都给孩子做保育费，只要能进工厂生产我就干！”她怀着这样的决心进了电器厂。开始时，虽然什么技术都不懂，可是她专心一意地勤学苦练，很快就掌握了冲压、绕线、安装等各种技术，成为全厂女职工的一面“红旗”。小型电动机车间下线组组长王淑华，是和侯淑芳一起进厂的四个孩子的妈妈。因为每天给孩子喂几遍奶，开始学绕线时，她赶不上同组的伙伴。中午，大家都回家吃饭去了，她把饭带到车间，匆匆吃完就抽空抓紧学绕线，连晚间回家的路上，也用手比划着绕线的动作，这样，几天就赶上了其他女职工的速度。过了不久，她就掌握了生产电流互感器各道工序的全部技术。今年3月，工厂又送她到电工学院去学习小型电动机的下线圈技术，回来就担任了小型电动机车间下线组组长工作。
    像王淑华、侯淑芳那样生产上刻苦钻研，迅速掌握生产技术的女职工，在香坊公社电器厂是很多的。现在，第一批进厂的十六名女职工都掌握了生产“电流互感器”、“变压器”等全套技术，成为各个车间的骨干力量。很多后进厂的女职工，在先进厂的工人们热情帮助下，也都迅速提高了生产技术。今年上半年，因为生产上做出了出色成绩，被评为全厂“红旗手”的女职工就有一百名左右。
    电器厂女职工们把全副精力都贯注在工厂的生产上，从各个方面关心着工厂。绕线组长侯淑芳，日夜考虑着怎么能使绕线这道工序由手工实现机械化，有时她夜里说梦话也在说工厂里的技术革新，她丈夫说她“成了革新迷了”！工厂绝缘组里，有十八个四十多岁的女工。她们在扎绝缘体上的棉绳时，想尽各种办法不使棉绳有一寸一分的浪费。有的老大娘说：“为了节省棉绳，我们在扎绝缘体时比我们当姑娘时扎花还要细心！”这种爱护工厂的思想，在许多方面都自然地表现出来。有一次，试制成功一批新产品，王淑华、侯淑芳、李香兰、刘恩英等六、七个女工，抬到一家有动力电的工厂去进行成品试验。半途上，忽然下了大雨。几个人谁也不用谁招呼，都自动脱下外衣包在产品的外边。她们宁愿自己挨雨淋，却谁也不肯让自己亲手制成的产品被雨水打湿一点。
    正是由于张季育、侯淑芳、王淑华等无数在城市公社化运动中成长起来的新生力量，促进了城市公社小型工业的飞跃发展。现在，由三个修表刻字工人起家的香坊公社日用电器厂已经发展成拥有六百多名工人、一千多平方米厂房和六十多台设备的中型工厂。他们成批生产的小电机、电流互感器等电器产品，源源供应着全国十七个省、市和支援了黑龙江省农业技术改造的需要。同时，还承担着每月给哈尔滨轴承厂修理各种损坏的电机，给国营建成机械厂承制电瓶车零件等生产任务，成为大厂生产大跃进中的有力助手。（附图片）
