The principle that "human effort makes a difference" is clearly reflected in the matter of arranging the lives of the masses.

After the summer harvest, the Jinxing Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, changed its past habits and did not use new grain because the rations they had saved from last autumn's harvest could last until August this year. The commune members sang: "No green vegetables in March, no unripe crops in May, the granary is full of grain, new grain covers the old grain." After the bumper harvest last autumn, this commune overfulfilled its grain procurement tasks. In addition to reserve grain, seeds, and fodder, the rations were kept according to national standards and were no more than those in other places. However, from then until now, they have neither requested supplies, nor touched their reserves (the reserve grain is enough to last a year), nor eaten new grain, but have had three meals a day, with full bellies and fragrant dishes. A few days ago, when the Central Ministry of Food held a "Living Arrangement Experience Exchange Meeting" in the Nanchong Special District, representatives from various places made in-depth visits to study the commune's experience. Everyone felt that a very important reason why this commune arranged the lives of the masses so well was that it possessed a red "housekeeper" team.

"New Cook"

For a period of time, members of the Second Production Team of the Tenth Management District of the Jinxing Commune were late for work, and their ten-day grain consumption plan was often exceeded. The cadres were very anxious about this phenomenon, but could not find a solution. Later, a young man came to the canteen of the Second Production Team, and some people called him the "new cook." It was this cook who solved the two major problems of the Second Production Team: starting work on time and planned grain consumption.

When the "new cook" arrived at the Second Production Team, he carefully inspected the canteen's stoves, water supply, and cooking utensils; widely learned about everyone's opinions; and carefully calculated how much grain was needed for each meal. He quickly discovered that the team was unable to start meals on time, which affected the members' work time. This canteen had four pots that were fired in four different places, the firepower was scattered, and the pots were not good, which wasted coal and the cooks could not take care of them all. This prolonged the meal time. After discovering these shortcomings, he stayed up for two nights and built a connected stove, which saved coal and had strong firepower, ensuring that meals started on time. The new cook also found that the canteen often over-consumed grain mainly because there was no plan for eating grain, the combination of grain and vegetables was not good, and too few vegetables were planted. Therefore, in addition to arranging grain consumption, he picked up a hoe early in the morning and in the evening and used the open space to grow vegetables. Under his leadership, the members quickly planted vegetables on all the surrounding open spaces. He also often promoted the benefits of saving after a good harvest and implemented a combination of grain and vegetables and planned grain consumption. Soon, the canteen had a monthly surplus of grain, life was very well arranged, and the team's production was also at the forefront of the entire management district.

This newly arrived cook is Feng Delian, the secretary of the Tenth Management District Branch. Throughout the year, he not only participates in field production in various teams, but also takes turns serving as a cook in various teams. Every time he goes to a place, he solves at least two or three problems before leaving.

"Good Housekeeper"

Walking into the Third Canteen of the Eleventh Management District of this commune, you can see a monthly income and expenditure statement posted on the wall. The statement clearly lists the income, expenditures, and balances of the canteen's grain, vegetable money, and self-operated income, item by item. The bottom section is marked with the three characters "Li Zhiguo."

Li Zhiguo was elected by the masses as the canteen manager a year ago. He knew that he could not shoulder this heavy burden alone. The day after he became the manager, he organized a canteen management committee. All important issues regarding meals, as well as expenses between three and ten yuan, had to be submitted to the canteen management committee for discussion and approval. Expenses of more than ten yuan were submitted to the members for discussion and approval. Therefore, the accounts he published were not only supported by receipts and evidence, but also, as the members said, "every penny is spent to our satisfaction."

Mobilizing every member to participate in canteen management is Li Zhiguo's greatest strength. Every month, he would work with the cooks, vegetable team members, and members to study how to combine grain and vegetables, how to adjust the taste, and widely solicit opinions to create a "recipe"; then, he would hold discussions with the members on "how to make the recipe a reality?" This made everyone in the entire canteen think about how to eat their fill, eat well, and save. Take vegetable planting as an example. In order to realize the plan of eating three catties of vegetables per day, the members of this canteen consciously took time early in the morning and in the evening to plant or manage radishes, green beans, pumpkins, cucumbers and other vegetables in the open space. There has always been a custom of "not planting vegetables in June" in the local area, believing that it is too hot at this time and there will be no harvest. However, Li Zhiguo mobilized the masses to come up with methods such as using branches and straw to provide shade, and using clear manure to irrigate at night, ensuring that vegetables were planted every month, and everyone could eat more than three catties per day all year round, and there were vegetables for sale every month. In the first half of this year alone, the income from the sale of vegetables was more than 550 yuan, and the canteen used this money to buy oil, salt, firewood, and charcoal. This canteen has grain, vegetables, and spices. In addition, Li Zhiguo discusses matters with everyone, and has long achieved a reasonable combination of busy and slack seasons, coarse and fine grains, and grain and vegetables. The members are all satisfied with their meals.

Li Zhiguo is not a full-time canteen manager. He also serves as the management district's cash cashier and the production team's accountant, with a lot of work. Over the past year, the masses have repeatedly given him "work stoppage subsidies," but this member from a poor peasant background always declined, saying: "I have said long ago that I don't want work stoppage subsidies. What I want is the public canteen, which is more valuable than anything else."

"Save a handful per meal, buy a horse in ten years"

These days, hot steamed sweet potato buns often appear on the dining tables of the Fengshou Canteen in the Fourth Management District. They taste fragrant, sweet and refreshing. The members who return from work laugh when they see them. However, some people cannot help but express a kind of ashamed sigh when they eat them. They remember clearly, it seems like it happened yesterday: large sweet potatoes ripened and were piled up in the canteen like small mountains. When cook Yang Zhikun was peeling sweet potatoes every day, he always carefully saved the sweet potato skins and roots, and chopped them up and dried them in the evening, often staying up until midnight. At that time, some people said: "We can't finish eating good sweet potatoes, can these skins still be served at the table?" They blamed him for doing "empty work." Today, it is these accumulated sweet potato skins and roots that have been ground into hundreds of catties of flour and steamed into fragrant and sweet buns. People who initially said that he was doing "empty work" always sigh with shame when they eat these buns, saying: "I am convinced. It is indeed as Yang Zhikun said - save a handful per meal, buy a horse in ten years."

Yang Zhikun not only pays attention to saving grain, but also pays attention to running the canteen frugally. He learned from others and modified the stove, and made a soil filter for drinking water. Once, a pot in the canteen leaked. On the one hand, he was reluctant to spend money to repair it, and on the other hand, he was afraid that asking someone from the city would delay cooking. He ran to an iron factory three miles away, bought "pot scraps," asked about the basics of repairing pots, came back and drilled into the hot connected stove, and repaired the leaking pot in time without delaying the meal.

Yang Zhikun is only in his thirties this year. He didn't know how to cook a year ago, but he said that he "will never forget the bitter days of helping long-term workers and carrying salt before liberation." Therefore, he knows that good days do not come easily. He often said: "Protecting the canteen is like protecting the foundation of the house."

Grain storage "native expert"

Now, when you go to the public canteen of the Second Management District of Jinxing Commune for meals, you can still eat fresh, red, sweet, and intact large sweet potatoes. Fresh sweet potatoes are truly worth a hundred times their weight at this time, and are the most popular food.

Everyone knows that sweet potatoes are most prone to mold and rot, and can generally only be stored for four months. However, Yang Baochun, the storage keeper of the Second Management District, has preserved the sweet potatoes harvested in October 1959 intact until now, for more than eight months. He will continue to preserve them until the autumn grain harvest. Needless to say, this involves a lot of knowledge. For example, if you pay a little attention, you will soon see that Yang Baochun's sweet potato cellars are all located in places like this: high terrain, not humid, good drainage, sandy soil, etc., because sweet potatoes are suitable for storage in dry places. The shape of the sweet potato cellars is also varied, and labels are inserted on the sweet potato cellars, indicating the weight of the sweet potatoes, the date of entry into the cellar, the purpose, and the time of exit from the cellar. It turned out that before the sweet potatoes entered the cellar, Yang Baochun implemented classified storage according to the different soils, the different growth periods of the sweet potatoes, and the characteristics of more or less water content, in order to plan to eat sweet potatoes with more water and are not easy to store first. In daily management, he is like a loving mother adding or removing clothing for her children on time. In response to the gradual decrease in water content and changes in temperature after sweet potatoes enter the cellar, he has come up with a whole set of methods to prevent freezing, dehumidify, and ventilate.... He is always thinking about the safety of sweet potatoes. In short, the sweet potatoes are foolproof in his hands. As the members sing in the clapper talk:

"We have Yang Baochun,
Sweet potatoes are under insurance pits,
Not afraid of the wind blowing during the day,
Not afraid of the rain at night,
You and I can just engage in production,
Eat safely and sleep soundly."
People from all over who come to visit and learn from him also praise Yang Baochun as "an outstanding native expert." Yang Baochun, who came from a poor peasant background, always says: "As long as none of the commune's sweet potatoes rot, and everyone can eat comfortably, I will be satisfied."

The housekeeper team of Jinxing Commune is composed of such people. They are all so conscientious, hardworking, and dedicated to making the lives of the masses comfortable. And they are also deeply loved by the broad masses.

    红色的“管家”队伍
    本报记者　王焕斗　 孙跃冬
    在安排群众生活的问题上，事在人为这个道理也如明镜似的反映得清清楚楚。
    四川省南部县金星公社，夏季丰收以后，改变了过去的习惯，没有动用新粮，因为他们去年秋收留下的口粮能吃到今年8月。社员歌唱道：“三月不吃青，五月不吃黄，粮食装满仓，新粮盖陈粮。”去年秋季丰收以后，这个社超额完成了征购任务，除了储备粮、种籽、饲料，口粮是按国家规定标准留的，并不比别的地方多。可是，从那时到现在，他们一没要供应，二没动储备（储备粮够吃一年），三没吃新粮，一日三餐、饭饱菜香。前些日子，中央粮食部在南充专区召开“安排生活经验交流会”时，各地代表特别深入访问、研究了这个社的经验，大家感到，这个社安排好群众生活的一个很重要的原因是：拥有一支红色的“管家”队伍。
    “新炊事员”
    金星公社第十管理区第二生产队，有一段时间社员出工很迟，每十天的用粮计划也常常超过。干部看到这种现象很着急，但始终没有办法解决。后来，第二生产队的食堂里来了一个青年人，有一些人称他是“新炊事员”。正是这个炊事员解决了第二生产队按时出工和计划用粮两件大事。
    “新炊事员”到了第二生产队，认真检查了食堂的锅灶、用水、炊具；广泛了解大家的意见；仔细计算每顿饭要用多少粮食等。他很快就发现这个队是不能按时开饭影响了社员出工时间。这个食堂有四口锅分四处烧火，火力分散，再加上锅也不好，不但费煤，炊事员也照顾不过来，这就把开饭的时间拖长了。发现了这些缺点，他就熬了两夜，修了个连锅灶，既省煤，火力又强，保证了按时开饭。这个新炊事员，还发现食堂粮食常常吃过了头的原因，主要是吃粮无计划，粮菜搭配不好，菜也种的太少。于是，除了安排好用粮以外，每天一早一晚他就扛起锄头，利用空地种菜。在他的带动下，社员们很快就将四周的空地全部种上蔬菜。他还经常向大家宣传丰收不忘节约的好处，实行粮菜搭配、计划用粮。不久，这个食堂的粮食月月有结余，生活安排得非常好，这个队的生产也走在全管理区的前头了。
    这个新来的炊事员是第十管理区支部书记冯德连。他一年到头，不仅到各队参加田间生产，还到各队轮流当炊事员。他每到一个地方，至少要解决两三个问题才走。 
    “好当家”
    走进这个公社十一管理区第三食堂，一抬头，就可以看见贴在墙上的收支月报表。表上将食堂的粮食、菜金和自营收入的收、支、结余，一笔笔写得清清楚楚。下款注有“李治国”三个字。
    李治国是一年前被群众推选当食堂管理员的。他深知光凭自己一个人挑不起这个重担，在他当上管理员的第二天，就组织了一个食堂管理委员会，凡是伙食上的重要问题，以及三元以上、十元以下的开支都要提交食堂管理委员会讨论批准。十元以上的开支，他就交由社员讨论通过。因此，他公布出来的账目，不但收有凭、支有据，而且正如社员们说的：“每一笔钱，都花得称心合意。”
    发动每一个社员都参加食堂管理，是李治国的最大长处。每月他都跟炊事员、蔬菜队员、社员一道，研究粮、菜怎样搭配，怎样调剂口味，并广泛征求意见，配成“食谱”；然后，又和社员座谈“怎样使食谱兑现？”这样，就使全食堂的人都为吃饱吃好吃省转动脑筋。就拿种菜来说吧，这个食堂的社员，为了实现每天吃菜三斤的计划，一早一晚全都自觉地抽出时间，在空地种植或管理萝卜、四季豆、南瓜、黄瓜等菜蔬。当地一直有“六月不种菜”的习惯，认为这时天热，种菜无收。但李治国却发动群众想出了用树枝和稻草遮荫，晚上用清粪水浇灌等办法，保证月月种菜，一年四季每人每天都能吃到三斤以上，而且月月有菜出售。仅今年上半年出售的蔬菜就收入五百五十多元，食堂就用这笔钱买了油、盐、柴、炭。这个食堂有粮、有菜、有香料，再加上李治国有事跟大家商量，长期做到农忙与农闲、粗粮与细粮、粮食与蔬菜合理配搭，社员都吃得称心满意。
    李治国并不是专职的食堂管理员，他还担任着管理区现金出纳和生产队的会计员，工作很多。一年来群众再三给他“误工补贴”，而这个贫农出身的社员却总是这样谢绝说：“我早就讲过，我不要误工补助，我所要的就是公共食堂，这比什么都贵重。”
    “一顿省一把，十年买匹马”
    这几天，在第四管理区丰收食堂的饭桌上，经常出现热气腾腾的红薯馍馍，吃起来又香又甜又爽口。收工回来的社员们，一见到它就嘻嘻哈哈笑。可是，也有人一吃到口里，就不由得发出一种惭愧的感叹。他们记得清清楚楚，这好像昨天发生的事情：大块的红薯成熟了，像小山一样堆放在食堂里。炊事员杨志坤每天削薯时，总是小心翼翼地将薯皮和薯根保存起来，到晚上再切碎、晾起，常常要熬到半夜。当时有的人说：“好薯都吃不完，这点皮皮还能上席？”怪他光干“空活路”。而今天，正是这日积月累的薯皮、薯根，磨出好几百斤粉，蒸出又香又甜的馍。当初说他做“空活路”的人，吃到这种馍馍总是惭愧地感叹说：“我算服了，硬是像杨志坤说的——一顿省一把，十年买匹马。”
    杨志坤不光注意省粮，他还注意勤俭办食堂。他学着别人的榜样改了灶，制造了吃水的土过滤器。一次，食堂有口锅漏了，他一来舍不得花钱补，二来怕进城请人会耽误作饭，便跑到三里外的铁工厂，买了“锅巴子”，问了问补锅的常识，回来就钻进热气逼人的连锅灶里，及时补好了漏锅，并没耽误开饭。
    杨志坤今年不过三十来岁，他一年前还不会作饭作菜，但他说，他“永远忘不了解放前帮长工、背盐巴的苦日子”，因此，他知道好日子来得不易。他常说：“保护好食堂，好比保护好屋基。”粮食保管“土专家”
    现在到金星公社第二管理区的公共食堂吃饭，还可以吃到鲜红、蜜甜、完整无损的大红薯。新鲜红薯在这个时候，真正是身价百倍，最受欢迎的食品。
    谁都知道，红薯是最易霉烂的，一般只能保管四个月，而第二管理区的保管员杨保春却将1959年10月收的红薯完整无损地保存到现在，足有八个多月了，他还要继续保存到秋粮登场。不用说，这里边是包含着很多学问的。比如，你要稍微留意，很快就会看出杨保春的薯窖，都设在这一类的地方：地势较高，不潮湿，排水良好，土壤带沙等等，因为红薯适宜在干燥地方保管。薯窖的形状也各式各样，而且在薯窖上都插了标笺，写明红薯斤数、入窖日期、用途、出窖时间等。原来，杨保春在红薯入窖前，便根据土壤不同，生长期不同的红薯，含水量有多有少的特点，实行分类分窖储藏，以便有计划先吃水分较多、不易储藏的红薯。在日常管理中，他就像慈母按时为孩子增减衣被一样，针对红薯入窖后含水量逐渐减少和气温的变化，想出一整套办法防冻、驱潮、敞气……。他时时为红薯的安全动脑筋。总之，红薯在他手里万无一失。正如社员们在快板中唱的：
  “我们有了杨保春，红薯下了保险坑，白天不怕风来吹，晚上不怕雨来淋，你我尽管搞生产，吃的安来睡的稳。”各地参观取经的人，也称赞杨保春“不折不扣是个出色的土专家”。贫农出身的杨保春，却总是这样说：“只要公社的红薯一块不烂，让大家吃的安逸，我就心满意足了。”
    金星公社的管家队伍，就是由这样一些人组成的。他们全都这样兢兢业业，任劳任怨，一心将群众生活安排的舒舒服服。而他们也受到了广大群众衷心爱戴。
