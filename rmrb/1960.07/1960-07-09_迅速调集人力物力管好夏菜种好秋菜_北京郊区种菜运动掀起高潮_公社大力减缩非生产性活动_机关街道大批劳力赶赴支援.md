(By our newspaper) A vigorous mass movement to grow vegetables is unfolding in the suburbs of the capital. In recent days, large numbers of laborers drawn from government offices, streets, water conservancy construction sites, and rural people's communes have been rushing to the vegetable production front to fight for managing summer vegetables well, planting autumn vegetables well, seizing the opportunity, and overcoming disasters.

To adapt to the continuously growing demand for vegetables in the city, this year Beijing has planted more than 40% more vegetable acreage than last year, making it the year with the most vegetable acreage in history. People's communes have drawn nearly 100,000 laborers to form professional teams to manage these vegetable fields. Because of the severe drought since the beginning of spring and the continuous occurrence of natural disasters such as pests, diseases, wind, and hail, the labor force used for drought resistance, water lifting, and pest control has greatly exceeded that of normal years. The recent period of agricultural activities has been very concentrated. The marketing, management, and planting of vegetables must be carried out simultaneously with the transplanting of rice and sweet potatoes. Therefore, rationally arranging the labor force and effectively ensuring the strengthening of the vegetable production front is a particularly important combat task at the present time.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently held consecutive meetings to study the current vegetable production situation. It pointed out that growing grain and vegetables well, and first and foremost not missing the farming season to manage and plant vegetables well, is the central content of implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation in the suburbs of Beijing. All rural work, as well as industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas, must be carried out around this policy. According to this spirit, the Municipal Committee decided to immediately conduct ideological education on the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, and first grasping agriculture, among the broad masses of cadres and commune members, combining it with current production tasks. Guided by this ideology, it was decided to immediately reduce and stop all non-productive activities and mobilize the necessary manpower and materials to launch a mass movement centered on managing and planting vegetables well. All commune industries, and even county (district) industries, must also focus on this movement, manufacturing tools, machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides for vegetable growing and for the upcoming autumn harvest and autumn plowing, temporarily suspending some industrial and sideline production activities that are not urgently needed for agricultural production, and drawing out labor to directly participate in vegetable production. The Municipal Committee has made specific arrangements for the labor, machinery, seeds, fertilizers, and other issues required for vegetable growing, and has established a vegetable growing command, drawing a group of responsible comrades from various departments and committees of the Municipal Committee and various party groups to lead working groups to the relevant counties (districts) to supervise, inspect, and assist in vegetable production.

In the past few days, more than 15,000 cadres and urban residents have gone to the front line of vegetable production, and a larger army of voluntary labor is preparing to depart. Various water conservancy construction sites, in accordance with changes in the agricultural season and production needs, are drawing more than 30,000 laborers to rush back to the communes day and night to support vegetable production, except for the manpower necessary for flood control and prevention. The relevant people's communes are also adjusting the labor force layout, vigorously reducing non-productive personnel, and drawing labor from commune-run factories that currently have no tasks for producing and repairing agricultural tools and machinery to strengthen the work on the front line of vegetable production. Now, everywhere in the suburbs, you can see weeding, pest control, vegetable harvesting, and planting professional teams active in the fields. Many vegetable fields that had not been cleared of weeds a few days ago have been thoroughly weeded after a concentrated effort. Pest control professional teams armed with various native and foreign pest control equipment are exterminating aphids and fire spiders. The number of vehicles transporting vegetables to the city on the roads from the suburbs to the city has also increased. Various people's communes have concentrated trucks to rush vegetables into the city, and many units have also transferred surplus vehicles to support. The progress of summer vegetable planting has been significantly accelerated compared to the previous few days. In Chaoyang District, only more than 100 mu of vegetables were planted in one day a few days ago, and now the planting progress has increased sharply by two times.

Various materials needed for vegetable production are also being actively prepared and supplied in a timely manner. Farm tool repair factories of various people's communes are manufacturing a large number of new tools for vegetable planting and land preparation. The Beijing Municipal and various county (district) agricultural machinery factories and some commune repair factories are rushing to manufacture 30 sets of tractor-drawn vegetable machinery and 500 sets of horse-drawn vegetable machines. In addition, 60 sets of semi-native and semi-foreign vegetable growing machinery have been distributed to the relevant communes for use. The steel needed to manufacture the machinery is being allocated overnight and will be delivered to the production site within two days. Commercial departments are helping the relevant communes organize the exchange of vegetable seeds. To prepare fertilizer for autumn vegetables, various people's communes and relevant departments are further tapping urban fertilizer sources and creating green manure on a large scale.

While strengthening the production of commercial vegetables by people's communes, many government offices, factories, schools, and troops have been planning to use all available idle land to grow self-sufficient vegetables. Production teams of many people's communes are using the "ten edges" to grow self-sufficient melons and vegetables on a large scale. More than 8,000 public canteens have established vegetable gardens so that everyone has a certain amount of vegetables to match their staple food and regulate their diet every day.

    迅速调集人力物力管好夏菜种好秋菜
    北京郊区种菜运动掀起高潮
    公社大力减缩非生产性活动  机关街道大批劳力赶赴支援
    本报讯　一个声势浩大的种菜群众运动正在首都郊区蓬勃展开。近几天来，从机关、街道、水利工地以及农村人民公社各个方面抽调的大批劳力，正纷纷赶赴蔬菜生产战线，为管好夏菜、种好秋菜、抓紧时机、战胜灾害而斗争。
    适应城市需要蔬菜量不断增长的情况，今年北京已种蔬菜的播种面积比去年增加40％多，成为历史上种菜面积最多的一年。人民公社抽调了近十万名劳动力组成专业队来管理这些菜田。由于入春以来干旱严重，病虫风雹等自然灾害又连续发生，因此用于抗旱、提水、除虫的劳力大大超过常年，最近一个期农事活动十分集中，蔬菜的上市、管理、播种同水稻、白薯插秧等项工作都要同时进行，因此，合理安排劳力，切实保证加强蔬菜生产战线，是当前一个时期特别重要的战斗任务。
    中共北京市委最近连续举行会议研究了当前蔬菜的生产形势。指出种好粮菜，首先是不失农时地管好、种好蔬菜，是北京郊区当前贯彻执行以农业为基础这条方针的中心内容。农村各项工作以及工业支援农业、城市支援乡村等活动，都必须围绕这个方针来进行。根据这个精神，市委决定立即在广大的干部和公社社员中，结合当前的生产任务，进行以农业为基础、首先抓农业的思想教育，并以此为指导思想，立即缩减和停止一切非生产性活动，调集必要的人力、物力，开展一个以管好和种好蔬菜为中心的群众运动。一切公社工业以至县（区）工业，也必须围绕这个运动，为种菜以及为即将到来的秋收秋耕等农事活动制造工具、机械和肥料、农药，把一些非农业生产所急需的工业、副业生产活动暂时停止下来，抽出劳力直接参加蔬菜的生产。对种菜所需的劳力、机械、种籽、肥料等问题，市委都已作了具体部署，并且成立了种菜指挥部，抽调市委各部委、各党组一批负责同志率领工作组分赴有关各县（区）督促、检查和协助蔬菜的生产工作。
    最近几天，已经有一万五千多名干部和城市居民开赴蔬菜生产第一线，一批人数更多的义务劳动大军正在整装待发。各个水利工地也按照农事季节的变化和生产的需要，除保留了拦洪、防汛所必需的人力外，正在抽调三万多名劳力星夜赶回公社，支援蔬菜生产。各有关人民公社也都在调整劳力布局，大力缩减非生产人员，同时从目前暂无生产、修理农具和农业机械任务的社办工厂中，抽调劳动力，加强蔬菜生产第一线的工作。现在，郊区到处都可以看到除草、除虫、收菜、播种的专业队活跃在田头，不少在几天前还没锄净杂草的菜地，经过突击已经锄得干干净净，由各种土洋除虫器械武装起来的灭虫专业队，正在扑灭蚜虫和火蜘蛛等虫害。从四郊通往城市的大路上，运菜上市的车辆也有了增加，各人民公社已经集中了大车来抢运蔬菜进城，很多单位也把多余的车辆调来支援。夏播蔬菜进度较前有了显著加快，朝阳区前几天一天只种菜一百多亩，现在播种进度猛增两倍。
    蔬菜生产所需要的各项物资，也正在积极准备和及时供应。各人民公社的农具修配厂正在制造大批蔬菜播种、整地的新工具。北京市和各县（区）农业机械工厂和部分公社修配厂，正在赶制三十套拖拉机牵引蔬菜机械，五百套马拉蔬菜机，另有六十套半土半洋的种菜机械已分配各有关公社使用。制造机械所需的钢材正连夜调拨，两天内就可全部送达生产现场。商业部门正在帮助各有关公社组织交换菜籽。为了给秋菜准备肥料，各人民公社和有关部门正在进一步挖掘城市肥源、大造绿肥。
    在加强人民公社商品蔬菜生产的同时，不少机关、工厂、学校、部队已在规划利用一切空闲土地种植自食蔬菜。许多人民公社的生产队，利用“十边”大种自食瓜菜，八千多个公共食堂已建立了菜园，使每人每天有一定数量蔬菜搭配主食调剂生活。（附图片）
