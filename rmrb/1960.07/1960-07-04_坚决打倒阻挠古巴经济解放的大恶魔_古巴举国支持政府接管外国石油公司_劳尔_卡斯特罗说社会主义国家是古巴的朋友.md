Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 2nd: The people of Cuba across the nation are enthusiastically supporting the government's takeover of the American Esso Mobil Oil Company, Texaco Oil Company, and Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil Company.

Letters, telegrams, and resolutions expressing support are flooding the editorial offices of Havana's newspapers. The Cuban National Federation of Petroleum Workers has made a resolution to "Maintain and increase production for the motherland and the revolution." Workers in the National Printing Office and other departments have also decided to increase production to support the government's actions. The Havana Province Petroleum Workers Union pointed out that the government's measures "overthrew the three big demons who are constantly plotting to obstruct our country's economic liberation."

The National Federation of Maritime Workers demands that "all refineries be owned by the people and all industries serve the country."

Trade unions across the country are also holding conferences to support the government's takeover of foreign oil companies. According to a resolution of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, a grand mass rally in support of the revolutionary government is being prepared in Havana.

Residents throughout Cuba held mass rallies in support of the government's patriotic policies. In Cabaiguán, a march was held against the three foreign oil trusts, with marchers chanting slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" Workers in Santa Clara drove Shell Oil Company trucks in a parade, with trucks displaying slogans such as "Rather die than lose the motherland" and "We support the takeover."

The "July 26th Movement," the Revolutionary Guidance Committee, and the Cuban People's Socialist Party organizations in Camagüey Province, as well as the local Revolutionary Women's League, the Camilo Cienfuegos Farmers Association, and other organizations, signed a joint statement, emphasizing in the context of imperialism that "We defeated it yesterday, we will defeat it tomorrow, and we will defeat it forever." The Cuban Women's Congress for Latin American Liberation and the Las Villas University Council have both passed resolutions condemning foreign oil companies for violating Cuban law.

The Cuban "World News" revealed that Shell Oil Company had participated in transporting weapons to the Batista dictatorship, Esso Mobil Oil Company received ten million dollars from the dictatorial regime, and Texaco Oil Company, like other companies, obtained many illegal privileges. "Today's News" called on all Cubans to strengthen the struggle and defeat the enemy in the oil battle. The newspaper emphasized that "Cuba is determined to fight for victory at any cost."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd: Cuban Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro, who is currently visiting Czechoslovakia, said today: "The United States threatens never to buy a kilogram of sugar from us. This would have been a disaster for Cuba in the past, but the situation is different today because we have received help from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. We know who our real friends are."

Raúl Castro visited an agricultural cooperative in North Bohemia today. After the visit, he said that before the revolution, almost all the land in Cuba was controlled by foreign imperialists and domestic landlords who colluded with them. Workers had only hard labor, poverty, and starvation. The Cuban government is rapidly solving these problems. In the year since the establishment of the revolutionary government, more new schools have been opened than in the past fifty years.

Castro also spoke about the implementation of land reform in Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 1st: At a gathering held last night by teachers and students of the Industrial Technology School, Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, pointed out that the slogans "Rather die than lose the motherland" and "We shall prevail" should not only be slogans for political struggle, but also slogans for Cuba's struggle for economic independence.

Guevara condemned the US imperialist plot to economically strangle Cuba. He said, "The US government is the darling of large monopoly groups. It has two main weapons: economic weapons and the weapons of war. The oil companies are today asking the State Department to take anti-Cuban action as a master summons a servant." Guevara said that foreign oil companies in Cuba used to make a profit of 36 million US dollars every year. "The conflict over the oil issue began when Cuba took an independent stand and prepared to uphold this position at all costs." Guevara pointed out, "This conflict will inevitably end with the victory of the Cuban people." Guevara said that when the US House of Representatives authorized the US President to arbitrarily reduce Cuba's sugar import quota, this approach was "like a sword hanging over their own heads. This big stick policy will also surely go bankrupt." He said, "If the US President dares to reduce our (sugar import) quota, we will also nationalize their companies here."

Guevara pointed out that the economic struggle will not be resolved in one or two years, but in ten or twenty years. He said, "The long-term economic struggle should make Cuba not only the political vanguard of Latin American liberation as it is today, but also the vanguard of the economically underdeveloped countries of Latin America."

    坚决打倒阻挠古巴经济解放的大恶魔
    古巴举国支持政府接管外国石油公司
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说社会主义国家是古巴的朋友
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴全国人民热烈支持政府接管美国埃索美孚油公司、德士古石油公司和英荷壳牌石油公司。
    表示支持的信电和决议像雪片一样地投到哈瓦那各报的编辑部。古巴全国石油工人联合会作出了“为了祖国和革命保持和增加生产”的决议，国家印刷所等其他部门的工人也决定以增加生产来支持政府的行动。哈瓦那省石油工人工会指出，政府采取的措施“打倒了不断阴谋阻挠我们国家经济解放的三个大恶魔”。
    全国海员工人联合会要求“把一切炼油厂归人民所有，一切工业为国家服务”。
    全国各地的工会也纷纷举行大会支持政府接管外国石油公司。根据古巴工人联合会的决议，正筹备在哈瓦那举行支持革命政府的盛大群众集会。
    古巴各地居民举行了支持政府爱国政策的群众大会。在卡瓦伊关，举行了反对三家外国石油托辣斯的游行，游行者高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号。圣克拉拉的工人们驾驶着壳牌石油公司的卡车列队游行，卡车上挂着“没有祖国毋宁死”和“我们支持接管”的标语。
    卡马圭省的“7月26日运动”、革命指导委员会和古巴人民社会党组织，以及当地的革命妇女联盟、卡米洛·西恩富戈斯农民协会等组织签署了一项联合声明，声明在谈到帝国主义的时候强调指出，“我们昨天击败了它，明天还将击败它，并且将永远地击败它。”古巴妇女争取拉丁美洲解放大会和拉斯维利亚斯大学理事会都通过决议，谴责外国石油公司违背古巴的法律。
    古巴“世界报”揭露壳牌石油公司曾参加给巴蒂斯塔独裁者运送武器的工作，埃索美孚油公司从独裁政权那里得到了一千万美元，德士古石油公司同其他公司一样获得了许多非法特权。“今日报”号召所有的古巴人加强斗争，在石油战役中击败敌人。这家报纸强调指出，“古巴决心不惜任何牺牲地争取胜利”。
    新华社布拉格2日电　正在捷克斯洛伐克访问的古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗今天说：“美国扬言决不向我们购买一公斤糖。这在以前对古巴来说，将是一种灾难，但是今天情况不一样了，因为我们得到了苏联和其它社会主义国家的帮助。我们知道了谁是我们真正的朋友。”
    劳尔·卡斯特罗今天参观了北波希米亚的一个农业合作社。他在参观以后说，在革命以前，古巴几乎所有的土地都掌握在外国帝国主义者和同他们勾结的国内大地主的手中。工人只有做苦工、受穷和挨饿的份儿。古巴政府正在迅速解决这些问题。在革命政府成立的一年当中，新开办的学校比过去五十年所开办的学校还要多。
    卡斯特罗还谈到了古巴实现土地改革的情况。
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉在工业技术学校师生昨晚举行的集会上指出，“没有祖国毋宁死”和“我们必胜”的口号不仅是政治斗争的口号，也应该是古巴争取经济独立的斗争口号。
    格瓦拉谴责美帝国主义在经济上扼杀古巴的阴谋。他说，“美国政府是大垄断集团的宠儿。它主要有两个武器：经济的武器和战争的武器。各石油公司今天正像主人召唤仆人一样要国务院采取反古巴的行动”。格瓦拉说，在古巴的外国石油公司过去每年获利三千六百万美元，“石油问题上的冲突是在古巴采取独立的立场和准备无论如何要坚持这种立场的时候开始发生的”。格瓦拉指出，“这场冲突必将以古巴人民的胜利而告终”。格瓦拉谈到美国众议院授权美国总统可以随意削减古巴食糖进口的份额时说，这种作法“就像悬在他们自己头上的剑一样。这种长鞭政策也一定会破产。”他说，“如果美国总统竟然降低我们（食糖进口）的份额，我们也将把他们在这里的公司收归国有。”
    格瓦拉指出，经济斗争不是在一两年内、而是要十年二十年才能获得解决的。他说，“长期的经济斗争应该使古巴不仅像今天这样成为拉丁美洲解放的政治上的先锋，而且也使它成为拉丁美洲经济上不发达的国家的先锋。”
