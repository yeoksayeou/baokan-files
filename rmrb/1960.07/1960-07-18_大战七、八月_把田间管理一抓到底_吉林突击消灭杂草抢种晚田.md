　　Fighting Through July and August: Grasp Field Management to the End
　　Jilin Launches a Blitz to Eliminate Weeds and Rush-Plant Late Crops
    (Our dispatch from Changchun, July 17th) Under the guidance of the thought of taking agriculture as the foundation, 200,000 cadres in Jilin Province are engaged in a battle in the fields, with 80% of the rural labor force投入 into the front line, fully promoting the summer hoeing and production increase campaign centered on eliminating grass, insects, and water damage, combined with planting autumn vegetables, late-season crops, and livestock feed.
    At present, the first battle of the province's summer hoeing production has achieved great results. More than 80% of the farmland has been hoed and cultivated twice. Some cities and counties have completed the second hoeing and cultivation and are moving into the third, resulting in excellent seedling growth, strength, and uniformity in most of the farmland. However, due to continuous rain, some farmland has not yet escaped the threat of seedling shortages, and insect and water damage have occurred to varying degrees in different areas. Under the strong leadership of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the vast number of cadres and commune members are determined to fight through July and August, grasp field management to the end, and strive for a bumper harvest. The number of cadres participating in the field management campaign has increased from 120,000 in the spring to 200,000. Many county-level party and government agencies have 80% of their leading cadres working and laboring at the grassroots level most of the time, and more than 90% of the cadres in communes and management areas regularly participate in and lead production. Dong Yukun, First Secretary of the CPC Siping Prefectural Committee, participated in production in the Hongwei Management Area of ​​Wangben Commune in Shuangliao County, summarizing five experiences to accelerate the progress of hoeing. With his leadership and assistance, the commune members in the entire area launched a blitz for three to five days and rescued 1,800 mu of seedling-deficient land in a timely manner.
    While strengthening the leadership of summer hoeing, the province has also made every effort to deploy troops and concentrate superior labor to strengthen the summer hoeing front. Party organizations at all levels have taken measures to streamline non-production personnel: arrange farm work according to individual abilities and circumstances, replace men with women, and replace the strong with the weak; commune-run industries are both industrial and agricultural, engaging in industry during the slack season and agriculture during the busy season; temporary laborers transferred out for sideline production and transportation are all transferred back to their original communes to participate in agricultural production, except for those who are retained according to regulations. Through these measures, the labor force on the summer hoeing front has increased significantly. For example, in Dunhua County, the proportion of labor投入 into field management and disaster relief has increased from 58% in early June to 85%. Da'an County greatly improved "logistics" tools, temporarily suspended or postponed some commune-run industries, and mobilized support from various government agencies, enterprises, and schools. These three measures alone have increased the summer hoeing front in the county by nearly 100,000 people, and the progress of hoeing has accelerated by about 50%. Since late June, the labor force in the province engaged in hoeing, pest control, and flood control has accounted for more than 80% of the total rural labor force. Communes where the second hoeing has not yet been completed and grass damage is more serious are carrying out a major blitz and large-scale collaboration, concentrating their efforts on weeding. The broad masses in areas where insect pests have occurred have adopted both indigenous and foreign methods, using both chemical and manual methods, launching a pest control blitz across the province. Under the guidance of the thought of "planning for the worst and striving for the best," the 200,000-strong flood prevention army is stepping up the rush repair of various flood prevention projects, making flood prevention, flood control, and drainage projects increasingly perfect. In some farmland affected by internal waterlogging and pest and disease disasters, late-season crops are being replanted in a timely manner under the slogan of "no reduction in production despite disaster."
    While carrying out the struggle to eliminate grass, pests, and water damage, the vast rural areas of Jilin Province have launched a "three plantings" movement: rush planting of autumn vegetables, rush planting of late-season crops, and rush planting of feed crops. According to statistics from eight cities and counties, including Changling, Nong'an, Hunchun, Liaoyuan City, and Yongji, more than 200,000 mu of vegetables, miscellaneous grains, and feed crops such as radishes, cabbage, carrots, buckwheat, corn, beans, and Setaria italica have been sown.
    In order to expand the summer planting area, in addition to planting all the originally reserved vegetable fields and the approximately 150,000 mu of uncultivated land, all available idle land is being fully utilized in the spirit of making the most of every inch of land, and the experience of intercropping and relay cropping is being promoted.
    Party organizations at all levels in Jilin Province believe that doing a good job in the "three plantings" is an important measure to increase grain production, improve people's lives, save grain, and promote the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, the "three plantings" work is listed as an important aspect of the current summer hoeing and production increase campaign. All localities are grasping the summer planting work as they grasped spring planting.

### 大战七、八月　把田间管理一抓到底　吉林突击消灭杂草抢种晚田

　　大战七、八月　把田间管理一抓到底
　　吉林突击消灭杂草抢种晚田
    本报长春17日电　在以农业为基础的思想指导下，吉林省二十万干部会战田间，80％的农村劳动力投入第一线，全力促进以消灭草害、虫害、水害为中心，结合种好秋菜、晚田作物和牲畜饲料的夏锄增产运动。
    目前全省夏锄生产第一个战役已取得巨大成绩，已有80％多的农田铲趟两遍，一部分市县已经结束了二遍铲趟，并转入三遍，赢得了大部分农田苗全，苗壮，苗齐的一派大好苗势。但是，由于阴雨连绵，目前仍有一部分农田尚未摆脱苗荒威胁，虫害、水害，在各地也有不同程度的发生。全省广大干部和社员在中共吉林省委的坚强领导下，决心大战7、8两个月，把田间管理一抓到底，争取农业丰收。参与田间大会战的各级干部已由春季的十二万增至二十万人。许多县级党政机关80％的领导干部大部分时间工作、劳动在基层，公社、管理区90％以上的干部经常参加生产领导生产。中共四平地委第一书记董玉昆在双辽县王奔公社宏伟管理区参加生产，总结出五项加快铲趟进度的经验，全区社员在他的带动和帮助下，突击了三、五天，就把一千八百亩苗荒地及时抢救出来。
    在加强夏锄领导力量的同时，全省又千方百计的调兵遣将，集中优势劳力，加强夏锄战线。各级党的组织采取精简非生产人员：因人因事地安排农活，以女换男，以弱换强；社办工业亦工亦农，农闲务工，农忙务农；临时外调搞副业、运输的劳动力除按规定留下以外，一律调回原公社参加农业生产，通过这些措施，夏锄战线的劳动力显著增加。如敦化县投入田间管理和抗灾斗争的劳动力，在总劳力中的比重已由6月初的58％增加到85％。大安县大改“后勤”工具，暂时停办或缓办了一些社办工业，动员各机关、企业、学校支援，仅采取这三项措施，就使全县夏锄战线增加近十万人，铲趟进度加快50％左右。6月下旬以来，全省在铲趟和灭虫、防汛战线上的劳动力已占农村劳力总数的80％以上。全县二遍铲趟还未结束、草害较为严重的公社，正在开展大突击，大协作，集中力量除草。发生虫害地方的广大群众，采取土法洋法同时并举、药杀人捕双管齐下的办法，在全省掀起灭虫突击运动。二十万防汛大军，在“从最坏处打算，向最好处努力”的思想指导下，正加紧抢修各类防汛工程，使防汛、防洪、防涝工程日益完善。因内涝和病虫灾害袭击成灾的部分农田，也在“受灾不减产”的口号下，及时的补种晚田作物。
    吉林省广大农村在开展消灭草害，病虫害，水害斗争的同时，又掀起一个抢种秋菜，抢种晚田，抢种饲料作物的“三种”运动。据长岭、农安、珲春、辽源市、永吉等八个市县的统计，目前已播种萝卜、白菜、胡萝卜和荞麦及玉米、豆子、西天谷等蔬菜、杂粮、饲料作物二十多万亩。
    为了扩大夏种面积，各地除了首先把原留的菜地和还未种植的十五万亩左右的开荒地全部种上以外，还本着见缝插针的精神，充分利用一切空闲土地，推行间种套种经验，做到了寸土必争。
    吉林省各级党的组织认为搞好“三种”是增加粮食产量，改善人民生活，节约粮食和促进畜牧业发展的重要措施，因此把“三种”工作列为当前夏锄增产运动的一个重要方面。各地像抓春播一样的抓夏种工作。
