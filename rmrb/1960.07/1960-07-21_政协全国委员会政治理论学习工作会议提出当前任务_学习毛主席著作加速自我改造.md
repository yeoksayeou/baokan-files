Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: The Political Theory Study Work Conference of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) closed on the 17th.

More than 200 relevant responsible persons from the National and Provincial, Municipal, and Autonomous Region CPPCCs and various democratic parties who attended the meeting exchanged work experiences from various regions. After heated discussions, it was believed that the current political theory study for bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals should involve studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, connecting with reality, improving understanding, gradually transforming the world outlook (standpoint, viewpoint, and method), establishing the ideological will to serve socialism, and improving the ability to work for socialism.

During the meeting, Ai Siqi gave a report to the attendees on how to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. The closing meeting on the 17th was presided over by Sun Qimeng, Deputy Director of the Study Committee of the CPPCC National Committee. Zhang Zhuyi, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the CPPCC National Committee, made a concluding speech.

The summary of the meeting pointed out: The Communist Party of China adopts a policy of unity, education, and remolding towards bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals. This has been the case in the past, and will continue to be so in the future. The remolding of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals must go through two main channels: first, social practice; second, political and ideological education. The two are closely linked and mutually influential, with practice playing a dominant role. Political and ideological education is carried out in many ways, and political theory study is an important part of political and ideological education. The Party has always attached great importance to and cared about the political theory study of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals. Since liberation, the Party has been actively helping and leading them in studying political theory.

The summary of the meeting pointed out that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals have made great progress through ten years of education and remolding, and that political theory study has played an important role in promoting their progress.

At present, the general trend among bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is to demand remolding and to demand study. Through study, most people have gained a further understanding to varying degrees of accepting the Party's leadership and taking the socialist road, the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the necessity of carrying out fundamental self-remolding. On the basis of improved understanding, they have gradually shortened the distance between themselves and the Party and the working people, and gradually increased their enthusiasm for serving socialism. However, there are also many people who are not very conscious of remolding, and their purpose of study is not very clear. In their studies, they are afraid of linking with their actual thoughts and are afraid of carrying out criticism and self-criticism. These situations are actually manifestations of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie in study, and also show that fundamental self-remolding needs to be continued.

The summary of the meeting believes that the current international and domestic situations are very good. This situation encourages the broad masses of people to constantly strive forward, and cultivate and promote the communist ideological style. Under this situation, bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals need to carry out a comprehensive remolding even more. Only through "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" and transforming their world outlook can they keep up with the development of the times. Otherwise, they will lag behind and fall behind.

The summary of the meeting emphasized that proposing the transformation of the world outlook does not mean that the transformation of the political stance has been completed. This is because the world outlook includes the stance, and the stance is a fundamental issue of the world outlook. As far as the current situation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is concerned, the issue of transforming the political stance still needs to be emphasized.

Regarding the content of study, the summary of the meeting proposed to carry out the study of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong will help us understand the spiritual essence of Marxism-Leninism by combining it with the current practical struggles and with our own ideological understanding problems, help us correctly understand the basic laws of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, correctly understand the current international situation and our tasks, and thus will inevitably be conducive to people from all walks of life to recognize the direction of their own remolding efforts.

When discussing the principle of linking theory with practice in study, the summary of the meeting pointed out: We must both oppose mechanically memorizing books without linking with reality and oppose neglecting the practice of studying theory. In the organization of short-term off-the-job study, theoretical study should be well arranged to help students learn to use the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism, better link with the reality of socialist revolution and construction, as well as the reality of self-remolding, and closely integrate understanding and practice. Regarding the method of study, the summary of the meeting emphasized adopting the principles of consciousness, voluntariness, independent thinking, and free debate. According to the experience of organizing study in various regions, it can be summarized as adopting the method of "gentle breeze and fine rain." The summary of the meeting believes that this is a method of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it is a democratic method, a method of persuasion, and a method of meticulous reasoning. Using this method in the self-education and self-remolding of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is generally more appropriate. However, adopting the method of "gentle breeze and fine rain" does not mean abandoning the method of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are the basic methods for us to carry out self-education and self-remolding. Negating criticism and self-criticism is tantamount to negating self-education and self-remolding from the basic method. Of course, while affirming criticism and self-criticism, it is also necessary to propose having criticism and having encouragement, and emphasizing the principle of combining criticism and encouragement.

The summary of the meeting also proposed that in the future, various methods should be adopted to vigorously run on-the-job and off-the-job political theory studies, so that off-the-job political studies and spare-time political studies complement each other, and further widely carry out political theory study work. Regarding how to arrange labor in short-term off-the-job study, the summary of the meeting believes that labor practice is the basis for bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals to carry out socialist remolding. However, because their labor training has been arranged in their work posts, and because the off-the-job study time is relatively short and the main task is to study political theory, the time for labor training should not be arranged or should be arranged less according to the length of the study time.

    政协全国委员会政治理论学习工作会议提出当前任务
    学习毛主席著作加速自我改造
    新华社20日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会政治理论学习工作会议17日闭幕。
    出席会议的全国和各省、市、自治区政协和各民主党派有关负责人二百多人，交流了各地的工作经验，经过热烈的讨论，认为当前资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子的政治理论学习，应该学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作，联系实际，提高认识，逐步改造世界观（立场、观点、方法），树立为社会主义服务的思想意志，提高为社会主义服务的工作能力。
    会议期间，艾思奇就如何学习毛泽东同志的著作问题向到会人员作了报告。17日的闭幕会由政协全国委员会学习委员会副主任委员孙起孟主持。中共中央统战部副部长、政协全国委员会副秘书长张执一作了总结发言。
    会议的总结中指出：中国共产党对资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子采取的是团结、教育、改造的方针。过去如此，今后仍然如此。资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子的改造，必须经过两个主要途径：一是社会实践；一是政治思想教育。二者是密切联系、互相影响的，其中又以实践处于主导地位。政治思想教育是从多方面进行的，政治理论学习是政治思想教育的一个重要部分。党对资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子的政治理论学习是一向甚为重视和关怀的，解放以来，党一直都在积极帮助和领导他们学习政治理论。
    会议总结中指出，资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子经过十年来的教育和改造是大有进步的，而政治理论学习，对于促进他们的进步，是起了重要的作用的。
    目前资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子总的趋势是要求改造、要求学习。经过学习，多数人对于接受党的领导和走社会主义道路，对总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，对东风压倒西风的国际形势，以及对进行自我根本改造的必要性等，在不同程度上有了进一步的认识。并在认识提高的基础上，逐步缩短了同党、同劳动人民的距离，逐步提高了为社会主义服务的积极性。但是，也有许多人对改造的自觉性还不很高，对学习的目的还不很明确，他们在学习中怕联系思想实际，怕开展批评和自我批评。这些情况，实际上是资产阶级两面性在学习上的表现，也说明了还需要继续进行自我根本改造。
    会议总结认为：当前的国际、国内形势都很好。这样的形势，激励着广大人民不断地努力前进，培养和发扬共产主义的思想风格。在这个形势下，资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子更需要进行全面的改造，只有经过“兴无灭资”，改造世界观，才能跟上时代的发展，否则就会落后，就要掉队。
    会议总结中强调指出：提出世界观的改造，并不意味着政治立场的改造已经完成了。而是因为世界观就包含了立场，而立场又是世界观的一个根本问题。就目前资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子的状况来说，改造政治立场问题，仍需要继续强调。
    关于学习内容问题，会议总结提出要开展对马克思列宁主义、对毛泽东同志著作的学习。学习毛泽东同志的著作，将帮助我们结合当前的实际斗争，结合自己的思想认识问题来了解马克思列宁主义的精神实质，帮助我们正确认识中国革命和社会主义建设的基本规律，正确认识当前国际形势和我们的任务，因而必然有利于各界人士认清自我改造的努力方向。
    会议总结在谈到学习中必须贯彻理论联系实际的方针时指出：我们既要反对死啃书本，不联系实际；又要反对忽视学习理论的做法。在短期离职学习的组织中，应当很好地安排理论的学习，帮助学员学习运用马克思列宁主义的理论武器，更好地联系社会主义革命和建设的实际，以及自我改造的实际，把认识和实践密切地结合起来。关于学习方法，会议总结强调采取自觉、自愿、独立思考、自由辩论的原则。根据各地组织学习的经验，归纳起来就是采用“和风细雨”的方法。会议总结认为这是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，是民主的方法、说服的方法、细致的讲理的方法。在资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子进行自我教育、自我改造中，采用这种方法，一般是比较适用的。但是，采用“和风细雨”的方法，绝不是意味着抛弃批评和自我批评的方法，批评和自我批评是我们进行自我教育和自我改造的基本方法，否定了批评和自我批评，就等于从基本方法上否定了自我教育和自我改造。当然在肯定批评和自我批评的同时，也要提出有批评、有鼓励，强调批评和鼓励相结合的原则。
    会议总结中还提出，今后要采取多种方式，大办在职、离职政治理论学习，使离职政治学习和业余政治学习相辅而行，进一步广泛开展政治理论学习工作。关于短期离职学习中如何安排劳动的问题，会议总结认为：劳动实践是资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子进行社会主义改造的基础，但是，由于他们的劳动锻炼在工作岗位中已有所安排，同时，由于离职学习的时间比较短，主要任务是学习政治理论，因此，应当根据学习时间的长短，不安排或少安排劳动锻炼的时间。
