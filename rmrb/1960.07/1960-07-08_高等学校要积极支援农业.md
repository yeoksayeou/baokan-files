Institutions of Higher Education Should Actively Support Agriculture
Xiao Bai

In the current nationwide mass movement to support agriculture, institutions of higher education are a powerful force. The support of agriculture by institutions of higher education is not only of great significance for the development of agricultural production, but also an important measure to further implement the Party's education policy. Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, in the past two years, institutions of higher education across the country have actively participated in activities to support agricultural production. Whether in terms of agricultural technology transformation, agricultural scientific research and the cultivation of agricultural technical talents, or in directly supporting agricultural labor, they have made good achievements and played a certain role in the development of agricultural production. Now, in the high tide of the nationwide support for agricultural production, the support for agricultural production by institutions of higher education has also been further developed. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the school Party committees, many institutions of higher education have established organizations to support agricultural production, widely linked up with rural people's communes, and formulated specific long-term plans for cooperation and support plans. This approach is worth advocating and promoting. Schools that have not yet taken action should quickly take up the work of supporting agriculture and regard it as an important part of further implementing the Party's education policy.

Institutions of higher education should focus on strengthening agricultural technology transformation, and help rural areas develop various undertakings from the aspects of cadre training, science and technology, and material conditions in a planned way, centering on the needs of the comprehensive and great development of agriculture. Institutions of higher education in various places should continue to strengthen ties with the people's communes, fix support targets, and provide regular support. It is necessary to organize teachers and students to go deep into the countryside in a planned way to study and summarize production experience with farmers, impart new production technologies to farmers in a timely manner, assist farmers in solving production technical problems, and send technicians with technical equipment to communes as much as possible to help farmers repair farm implements. Institutions of higher education should take the responsibility of accelerating the training of technical personnel in rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to establish agricultural technical schools or training courses of various levels and types in a planned way, to cultivate and improve agricultural technical cadres in a faster, better and more economical way.

For all agricultural colleges, supporting agriculture is of greater significance. Only by supporting agriculture can agricultural colleges better implement the Party's education policy, promote the in-depth development of the education revolution, and comprehensively advance teaching work. Therefore, all agricultural colleges and schools closely related to agricultural production should actively serve agriculture in various ways in combination with the characteristics of their majors. While helping agriculture to carry out technological transformation, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out scientific research related to agriculture, help farmers sum up experience in high-yield production, and combine the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" with China's fine tradition of intensive cultivation to systematically summarize a set of agricultural science with Chinese characteristics in a planned way.

Factories run by institutions of higher education, wherever conditions permit, should include the production of various agricultural tools or other machinery, power equipment, chemical fertilizers, etc. needed by rural areas as projects for the production or trial production of new products in school factories, and help people's communes repair and equip large agricultural tools. Students of institutions of higher education should actively participate in agricultural production labor according to the needs of agricultural production and using the prescribed working hours, and support agriculture in terms of labor.

Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and supporting agriculture is a major political task for the whole people. Our institutions of higher education must become a large army supporting agriculture. All teachers and students must take active action and contribute their strength to winning a bumper harvest in agriculture with the spirit of going all out and aiming high!

    高等学校要积极支援农业
    肖柏
    在当前支援农业的全民性的群众运动中，高等学校是一支强大的力量。高等学校支援农业，不仅对发展农业生产有重要意义，而且是进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针的一项重要措施。在党的教育方针的指导下，两年来，全国高等院校积极参加了支援农业生产的活动。无论是在农业技术改造方面，在农业科学研究和培养农业技术人才方面，以及在直接支援农业劳动力方面，他们都做出了很好的成绩，对发展农业生产起了一定的作用。现在，在全民性的支援农业生产的高潮中，高等院校支援农业生产也有了进一步发展。许多高等院校在各地省、市委和学校党委的领导下，成立了支援农业生产的组织，广泛和农村人民公社挂钩，并订立了具体协作的长远规划和支援计划。这种做法值得提倡和推广。凡是没有行动起来的学校，要赶快把支援农业的工作抓起来，并把它作为进一步贯彻党的教育方针的一项重要内容。
    高等院校支援农业，应以加强农业技术改造为中心，围绕农业全面大发展的需要，有计划地从培养干部、科学技术和物质条件等方面帮助农村发展各项事业。各地高等院校要继续加强与人民公社挂钩，固定支援对象，经常给予支援。应该有计划地组织师生深入农村，同农民一起研究与总结生产经验，把新的生产技术及时传授给农民，协助农民解决生产技术问题，并且尽可能派出技术人员携带技术设备到公社去帮助农民修理农具。高等院校应该负起加速帮助农村培养技术人材的责任。因此，需要有计划地创办各级各类农业技术学校或训练班，多快好省地培养与提高农业技术干部。
    对一切农业院校来说，支援农业更具有重要意义。农业院校通过支援农业，才能更好地贯彻党的教育方针，促进教育革命的深入和教学工作的全面跃进。因此，所有农业院校以及与农业生产密切相关的学校，更应当结合专业的特点，运用各种方式积极为农业服务。在帮助农业进行技术改造的同时，还要大力开展与农业有关的科学研究，帮助农民总结丰产经验，结合农业“八字宪法”和我国精耕细作的优良传统，有计划地总结出一套具有我国特点的农业科学来。
    高等院校自办的工厂，凡是有条件的，都要把生产各种各式农具或生产农村需要的其他机械、动力设备、化学肥料等列为学校工厂的生产或试制新产品的项目，并且帮助人民公社修配大型农具。高等院校的学生应根据农业生产的需要，利用规定的劳动时间，积极参加农业生产劳动，在劳动力上支援农业。
    农业是国民经济发展的基础，支援农业是全民的重大政治任务。我们高等学校要成为支援农业的一支大军，全体师生必须积极行动起来，以鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，为争取农业丰收贡献出自己的力量！
