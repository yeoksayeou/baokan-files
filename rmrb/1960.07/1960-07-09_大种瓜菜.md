    Plant Vegetables Extensively

    "Radishes in the first Fu, vegetables in the second Fu" - now is the season for planting vegetables extensively. All regions must seize this favorable opportunity, organize people's communes, production teams, and the vast number of members, as well as organizations, schools, and enterprises, to plant vegetables extensively by every possible means.

    Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Current Vegetable Work" this February, Party committees in various regions have further strengthened leadership over vegetable production. Many regions have expanded the area for spring and summer vegetable sowing compared to last year, and most public canteens in rural areas are also growing more vegetables than last year. Since the beginning of summer, the supply of vegetables in the market has been increasing. This shows that the situation of vegetable production this year is very good. However, this is not enough. We must do better in vegetable production. We must plant more and special types of vegetables to ensure that rural people's communes not only have self-sufficiency in vegetables, but also have a certain amount of reserves and more vegetables to supply to cities. Each city should also strive to achieve self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency in vegetables. Some places have proposed the goal of urban residents eating more than one catty of vegetables per day, which is very good and achievable. Recently, Beijing launched a massive mass movement for planting vegetables. People's communes in rural areas transferred a large number of laborers from various aspects, and organizations, streets, and water conservancy construction sites transferred a large number of supporting forces, rushing to the front line of vegetable production, striving to manage summer vegetables well and plant autumn vegetables well. Shanghai and Guangxi, Qinghai, Yunnan and other provinces and regions are also focusing on vegetable production. A national movement of planting vegetables extensively in summer has taken shape.

    Efforts to increase vegetable production are an important measure to improve people's livelihoods. With the further improvement of people's lives, there is not only a need for more vegetables, but also for better quality vegetables. Vegetables are rich in nutrition, containing a large number of vitamins and minerals. The vitamins and minerals needed by the human body are mainly supplied by vegetables. Eating more vegetables and implementing a mixed diet of grains and vegetables can not only increase nutrition and maintain health, but also save food. This year's natural climate in our country is very abnormal. Some places have encountered severe spring droughts after the great drought last year; some places have too much precipitation; coastal areas such as Fujian and Guangdong have also encountered strong typhoons. Although the people in these areas, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, have carried out a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters and achieved great achievements; however, in today's world where humans cannot fully control nature, severe natural disasters will inevitably bring certain damage to our agricultural production. Vegetables are a kind of crop that grows fast and has a large yield. Planting more vegetables has a huge effect on recovering the losses caused by natural disasters to agricultural production in the previous period, and also has a huge effect on preventing possible famines. Some disaster-stricken areas have already proposed the goal of having 1,000 catties of sweet potatoes, 2,000 catties of vegetables, 1,000 catties of carrots, and 1,000 catties of substitute foods per person. This is very good and all measures should be taken to ensure its realization. All disaster-stricken areas should do this. Although the standards in non-disaster areas may not be so high, they should also plant vegetables extensively, as well as dry vegetables and pickle vegetables extensively.

    Summer is the most ideal season for planting vegetables. The temperature is high in summer, the rainfall is abundant, the growing season of vegetables is short, the harvest is fast, and the yield is high. All regions should make full use of the current favorable natural conditions to quickly launch a mass upsurge of planting vegetables extensively. Leading cadres in various regions should go deep into the communes and production teams to check the summer vegetable sowing situation, and effectively help solve the specific problems such as labor and seeds in expanding the planting of summer vegetables. All places that have not completed the sowing plan or have not planted enough should quickly rush to plant and strive to complete the plan and plant enough summer vegetables; places that have completed the sowing plan should also use all leisure land to increase the replanting area of vegetables through intercropping, interplanting, and mixed planting. The people's communes in the suburbs of Tianjin have used more than 30,000 mu of land left before autumn to interplant quick-growing vegetables; Neixiang County in Henan Province has planted nearly 40,000 mu of melons and vegetables using scattered vacant land and reclaimed land in the mass upsurge of planting summer vegetables; Jiaxing area in Zhejiang Province has mobilized the masses to expand the planting of summer vegetables on 130,000 mu of scattered land such as field edges since May. This shows that the potential for planting vegetables in various places is great. In planting vegetables extensively, try to plant more pumpkins as possible. Pumpkin is a crop that is both drought-resistant and flood-resistant. It is a crop that can be planted everywhere regardless of soil quality, and it has high yield, wide uses, and is easy to store. Pumpkin can be used as a vegetable, as a staple food; it can be used to make sugar and brew wine, and it is also a very good refined feed.

    Vegetable production, like other agricultural production, is closely linked to planting and management. While planting vegetables extensively, we must strengthen field management of vegetables, improve unit yield, and strive to achieve high yield and more income. This year, many regions have increased some new vegetable fields, and many melons and vegetables are planted on reclaimed land and scattered land, which requires more strengthening of management. The center of field management is water, fertilizer, and protection (pest control). We must water frequently, apply more fertilizer, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests in time to ensure the healthy growth of summer vegetables. While planting summer vegetables extensively, we must also prepare for autumn vegetable production, implement the sowing area, arrange the labor force, and prepare the production materials such as fertilizer and seeds.

    Efforts to increase summer vegetable production are not only an important economic task, but also an important political task; not only for improving people's lives at present, but also for promoting the further development of animal husbandry and agriculture. All regions should grasp vegetable production as they grasp grain production. Now, the summer harvest is already in hand, and the vast number of members are full of confidence in seizing the autumn harvest. All walks of life across the country have also set off an upsurge of supporting agriculture. These are favorable conditions for increasing summer vegetable production. As long as we strengthen leadership, widely mobilize the masses, and give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, we will definitely be able to plant and manage summer vegetables well, prepare for autumn vegetable production, and strive for a bumper harvest of vegetables throughout the year.

### 大种瓜菜

    大种瓜菜
    “头伏萝卜，二伏菜”，现在正是大种瓜菜的季节。各地要紧紧抓住这个有利时机，组织人民公社、生产队和广大社员以及机关、学校、企业，千方百计地大种瓜菜。
    自从今年2月党中央和国务院发出“关于当前蔬菜工作的指示”以来，各地党委进一步加强了蔬菜生产的领导，许多地区春播和夏播的蔬菜面积都比去年有所扩大，农村大部分公共食堂种的菜也比去年多，入夏以来市场蔬菜供应量不断增加。这说明今年蔬菜生产形势很好。但是，这还不够，还要把蔬菜生产搞得更好，还要大种特种瓜菜，作到农村人民公社不仅蔬菜自给，还有一定数量的储备，并有更多的蔬菜供应城市；各个城市也要努力作到蔬菜自给或基本自给。有些地方提出城市人口每天吃到一斤以上蔬菜的奋斗目标，是很好的，可以作到的。最近北京市展开了声势浩大的种菜群众运动，农村人民公社从各个方面抽调了大批劳力，机关、街道、水利工地抽调了大批支援力量，纷纷赶赴蔬菜生产前线，力争管好夏菜，种好秋菜。上海市和广西、青海、云南等省、区，也都在大抓蔬菜生产。一个全国规模的夏季大种蔬菜的运动已经形成。
    努力增加蔬菜生产，是改善人民生活的重要措施。人民生活进一步提高了，不仅需要更多的蔬菜，而且需要质量更好的蔬菜。蔬菜营养丰富，含有大量的维生素和矿物质，人体所需要的维生素和矿物质主要是由蔬菜供给的。多吃蔬菜，实行粮菜混吃，既能增加营养维护身体健康，也能节约粮食。今年我国的自然气候很不正常，有的地方在去年大旱之后，又遇到了严重的春旱；有的地方降水太多；福建、广东等沿海地区，又遇到了强台风的袭击。虽然这些地区的人民，在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，同各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，取得了巨大的成就；但是，在人类还不能完全控制自然的今天，严重的自然灾害毕竟还会给我们的农业生产带来一定的损害。瓜菜是一种生长快、产量大的作物，多种瓜菜对于挽回前一时期由于自然灾害给农业生产造成的损失，有巨大作用，对于防止可能出现的灾荒，也有巨大的作用。有些受灾地区已经提出了每人要有一千斤红薯、二千斤菜、一千斤胡萝卜和一千斤代食品的奋斗目标，这是很好的，应该采取一切措施保证实现。一切有灾的地区都应该这样做，无灾地区标准虽然不一定这样高，但也要大种瓜菜，同时大晒干菜，大腌咸菜。
    夏季是大种蔬菜的最理想的季节。夏季气温高，雨水充沛，蔬菜生长期短，收获快，产量高。各地要充分利用当前有利的自然条件，迅速掀起一个群众性的大种瓜菜高潮。各地领导干部应该深入公社、生产队检查夏菜播种情况，切实帮助解决扩种夏菜中的劳动力、种子等具体问题。凡是没有完成播种计划的地方或种得不足的地方，都应该赶快突击抢种，力争完成计划，把夏菜种足；已经完成播种计划的地方，也应该利用一切休闲地，通过间作、套种、混作等办法，增加蔬菜复种面积。天津市郊区各人民公社，利用秋季前的留白地，加茬套种快熟菜三万多亩；河南内乡县在群众性的大种夏菜高潮中，利用零星空闲地和开荒地种瓜菜近四万亩；浙江嘉兴专区从5月份以来，发动群众利用田边地角等零星杂地扩种夏菜达十三万多亩，这说明各地种植瓜菜的潜力是很大的。在大种瓜菜中，要尽可能多种一些南瓜。南瓜是一种既耐旱又耐涝的作物，是一种不择土质到处能种的作物，而且产量高、用途广，容易贮存。南瓜既可以作菜，又能当主食；既可以用来制糖、酿酒，又是很好的精饲料。
    蔬菜生产和其他农业生产一样，种和管是紧密相连的。在大种瓜菜的同时，要加强蔬菜田间管理，提高单位产量，力争实现高产多收。今年许多地区都增加了一部分新菜田，许多瓜菜又是种在开荒地和零星土地上，更需要加强管理。田间管理的中心是水、肥、保（治虫）。要勤浇水，多施肥，及时防治病虫害，保证夏菜生长健壮。在大种夏菜的同时，还要准备秋菜生产，把播种面积落实，把劳动力安排好，把肥料、种籽等生产资料准备好。
    努力增加夏菜生产，这不单是重要的经济任务，也是重要的政治任务；不只为了当前改善人民生活，也为了促进畜牧业和农业进一步的发展。各地应该像抓粮食一样抓蔬菜生产。现在，夏季丰收已经到手，广大社员正在信心百倍地夺取秋季大丰收。全国各行各业也掀起了支援农业的高潮。这些都是增产夏菜的有利条件。只要加强领导，广泛发动群众，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，就一定能够把夏菜种好管好，把秋菜生产工作准备好，争取全年蔬菜大丰收。
