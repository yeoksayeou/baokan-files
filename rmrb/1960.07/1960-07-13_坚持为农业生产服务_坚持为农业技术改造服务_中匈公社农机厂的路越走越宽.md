　　Maintaining service to agricultural production and maintaining service to agricultural technology transformation.
　　The road of the Sino-Hungarian Commune Agricultural Machinery Factory is getting wider and wider.
    (Our report) The Huangtugang Sino-Hungarian Commune Agricultural Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Fengtai District, Beijing, under the guidance of the thought of taking agriculture as the foundation, does not aim at making profits, but tries every means to serve the agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation of the commune, and has made great achievements. It has become an advanced pacesetter for commune industries in the district to actively serve agricultural production.
    Since the establishment of this repair and manufacturing plant at the beginning of this year, it has been closely integrated with the needs of the commune's agricultural production, and has actively carried out the repair, manufacture and reform of agricultural implements. More than 90% of its products are directly serving agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six months or so, it has repaired more than 9,000 pieces of large and small agricultural machinery for the commune; it has cooperated with the commune in carrying out movements such as accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, fighting drought and sowing seeds, and mechanization and semi-mechanization of canteens, and has produced belt conveyors, handcarts, bulldozers, shovel-weeding machines, peanut planters, seedling setting devices, electric screens, universal vegetable cutting machines and other agricultural implements, amounting to more than 6,400 pieces. New products such as ditching machines, tine harrows, and air compressors have been successfully trial-produced using indigenous methods. In the agricultural technology transformation movement, one-third of the commune's electric wells have achieved automatic control, and an automatic furrow changing device has been created. In addition, the factory has also drawn five workers and five technicians to form a mechanical research group, specializing in the research and trial production of various labor-saving agricultural machinery. At present, it has imitated and successfully trial-produced more than ten kinds of machines, such as cabbage harvesters, ridging machines, remote control consoles for electric wells, and automatic furrow changing devices for watering vegetables.
    The factory's great achievements are the result of resolutely implementing the policy of commune industry serving agricultural production. When the factory was first established, the commune party committee clearly pointed out that the central task of the factory was to serve the commune's agricultural production and rural technology transformation, and not to aim at making profits. The party branch of this factory resolutely implemented the instructions of the commune party committee, and in the process of production and factory construction for more than half a year, it constantly carried out resolute struggles against the erroneous thinking of pursuing profits from external processing. In March of this year, a unit requested the factory to process baking ovens. At that time, a few people advocated stopping the manufacture of agricultural machinery and accepting this processing task, believing that doing so could increase income for the commune and the factory. After discovering this problem, the factory party branch immediately convened a meeting of all production team leaders and above to conduct a debate. In the debate, many people said that we came from agriculture to run factories in order to manufacture machines, improve agricultural tools, improve labor efficiency, and solve the difficulties of labor shortage, and we must never delay agricultural production. Some said that accepting this batch of orders would affect the production of shovel-weeding machines and ditching machines that are urgently needed in agriculture, and the orders cannot be accepted. Some said that if agriculture is not done well, what is the use of making money? If commune industries all do this, and do not serve agriculture, agriculture will not be able to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization quickly, which is detrimental to the socialist construction of the entire country. After the debate, everyone unified their thinking. Since the establishment of the factory, whenever the factory party branch encounters similar problems, it organizes everyone to debate, and often conducts positive education for all factory employees, so that the policy of commune industry serving agricultural production has been implemented.
    The specific methods of this factory for serving agricultural production are: 1. The factory leaders often participate in the meetings of the commune and production brigades to study agricultural production, and arrange the factory's production tasks according to the needs of the commune's agricultural production, so that the factory's production is closely integrated with agricultural production; 2. Organize specialized forces to focus on solving the most urgent problems in agricultural production. This commune plants vegetables on a large area, and sowing, field management and harvesting require a lot of labor. In view of this situation, the factory organized special personnel to study and manufacture vegetable bundling and cutting machines. 3. Produce and repair agricultural tools in various ways, and the service methods are flexible. Repair and manufacture large agricultural tools, and also repair and manufacture general agricultural tools, carry out repairs in the factory, and also go to the production site for repairs. 4. According to the fact that it has more equipment and a higher technical level, it actively helps and guides the small agricultural tool repair factories of the various production brigades within the commune. 5. Give play to subjective initiative, rely on our own efforts, work hard, and solve the difficulties of equipment and raw materials. If there is no coke for casting iron, go to a waste slag pile of an iron-smelting plant to find it, and if there is no steel material, use the leftovers from large factories, or go to the waste product company to find a solution.
    Because the direction is clear and the road is right, this factory has not only played a great role in agricultural production, but the factory itself has also developed. Now the factory has twenty pieces of equipment such as lathes and milling machines, and the technical level of the workers has also been improved, from being able to repair and manufacture simple agricultural tools such as iron shovels and iron hoes, to being able to repair and manufacture complex machinery such as harvesters, pot-camel machines, and tractors, from repairing agricultural tools to being able to manufacture products such as water pumps, electric motors, and combine harvesters.

### 坚持为农业生产服务　坚持为农业技术改造服务　中匈公社农机厂的路越走越宽

　　坚持为农业生产服务　坚持为农业技术改造服务
　　中匈公社农机厂的路越走越宽
    本报讯　北京市丰台区黄土岗中匈公社农业机械修造厂，在以农业为基础的思想指导下，不以赚钱盈利为目的，千方百计为本公社的农业生产和农业技术改造服务，做出了很大成绩，成为全区公社工业积极为农业生产服务的先进标兵。
    这个修造厂自今年初建厂以来，就紧密结合公社农业生产的需要，积极进行了农具的修理、制造和改革工作，有90％以上的产品，都是直接为农业生产服务。据不完全统计，半年多来，共为公社修理了大小农业机具九千多件；配合公社开展的积肥、兴修水利、抗旱播种、食堂机械化半机械化等运动，生产了皮带运输机、手推车、推土机、铲趟机、花生播种机、定苗器、电动筛子、万能切菜机等三十多种农业机具，达六千四百多件。并用土法试制成功了开沟机、丁齿耙、空气压缩机等新产品。在农业技术改造运动中，公社三分之一的电井实现了自动控制，并创造了自动改畦口器。另外，这个工厂还抽出五名工人和五名技术人员，组成了机械研究小组，专门研究试制各种节省劳动力的农业机械，现在已仿制和试制成功白菜收割机、打埂器、电井远方控制工作台、浇菜自动改口器十多种机具。
    这个工厂做出了这样大的成绩，是坚决贯彻执行公社工业为农业生产服务的方针的结果。工厂刚建立，公社党委就明确指出，工厂的中心任务是为公社的农业生产和农村技术改造服务，不以赚钱盈利为目的。这个厂的党支部坚决贯彻执行了公社党委的指示，在半年多的生产和建厂过程中，不断向追逐对外加工利润的错误思想进行了坚决的斗争。今年3月，有一个单位要求这个厂加工烤面包的吊炉。当时有少数人主张停制农业机械，接受这项加工任务，认为这样做可以为公社和工厂增加收入。工厂党支部发现这个问题后，立即召开了全厂生产小组长以上干部会议，进行辩论。在辩论中很多人说，我们从农业上转过来办工厂，就是造机器，改良农具，提高劳动效率，解决劳动力不足的困难，绝不能耽误了农业生产。有的说接受这批订货，就要影响当前农业上急需的铲趟器、开沟器的生产，不能接受订货。有的说，农业搞不好，赚了钱有什么用，公社工业都这样干，不为农业服务，农业上不能很快实现机械化半机械化，对整个国家的社会主义建设都不利。经过辩论，大家统一了思想认识。从建厂至今，工厂党支部遇有上述类似问题，就组织大家辩论，并经常向全厂职工进行正面教育，这样就使公社工业为农业生产服务的方针得到了贯彻执行。
    这个厂为农业生产服务的具体办法是：一、工厂领导干部经常参加公社和生产大队研究农业生产的会议，根据公社农业生产需要，安排工厂生产任务，使工厂生产和农业生产紧密结合；二、组织专门力量，集中解决农业生产中最迫切的问题。这个公社大面积种植蔬菜，播种、田间管理和收割都要占用大量劳动力。根据这种情况，工厂就组织专人研究制造蔬菜捆割机。三、生产修配农具多种多样，服务方式机动灵活。修配制造大农具，也修配制造一般农具，在厂内进行修理，也下到生产现场进行修理。四、根据本身设备较多和技术水平较高的情况，对公社内部各生产大队的小型农具修配厂，积极进行帮助和指导。五、发挥主观能动性，自力更生，穷干苦干，解决设备原材料困难。铸铁没焦炭，就到一个炼铁厂废渣堆去找，没钢铁材料就利用大工厂的下脚料，或者去废品公司想办法。
    由于方向明确，道路走得对，这个工厂不但在农业生产上发挥了很大作用，工厂本身也获得了发展。现在这个工厂已拥有车床、铣床等设备二十台，工人的技术水平也有了提高，由只能修配铁锨、铁镐等简单农具，发展到能够修配各种收割机、锅驼机、拖拉机等复杂机械，由修配农具发展到能够制造水泵、电动机、联合收割机等产品。
