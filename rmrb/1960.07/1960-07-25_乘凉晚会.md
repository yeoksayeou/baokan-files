	Cool Evening Party
	On a summer night, a cool breeze wafts through the air. Strings of red and green electric lights hang from the lush plane trees in front of the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard's Trade Union building. The factory's advanced collectives and advanced producers, having finished a week of pleasant and intense labor, are spending their weekend here with leading cadres, holding a cool evening party.

	Cadres and Workers Perform Together
	On the lawn to the right of the first cafeteria, a tall open-air stage attracts crowds. Some sit on long benches, others stand around. They watch intently as leading cadres and workers perform various programs on stage. Applause and laughter rise and fall on the lawn.

	The announcer declares: "Next is a chorus by the female workers of the turbine workshop. Conductor: Zheng Xingquan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch; Accordion accompaniment: Xin Zhifang, Chairman of the Trade Union." As soon as the words are spoken, applause bursts out. The two-part harmony "Socialism is Good" begins. Zheng Xingquan, the Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, waves his arms with increasing energy, the female workers sing louder and louder, and Xin Zhifang, the Chairman of the Trade Union, plays more and more beautifully. The audience cheers. Zhou Sanyou, the director of this workshop, is holding a child in his arms, smiling and watching from the last row of benches. It turns out that he saw the Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch go on stage to conduct and the Chairman of the Trade Union play the accordion, so he is helping the female comrades who went on stage to sing by taking care of their children. Leading cadres and the broad masses are in high spirits, and a joyful atmosphere permeates everywhere.
	Secretary and Advanced Producers Play Ping-Pong
	On the asphalt road covered with green trees, people are packed tightly. Party Secretary Tao Li and National Advanced Producer Wu Xiankang are battling it out at the ping-pong table. Secretary Tao, tall with long arms, attacks from both sides, while Wu Xiankang is mobile and flexible, looking for opportunities to smash. The two are playing neck and neck. More and more people are watching the game, and those in the back can't see clearly, so they simply bring some bricks to stand on.

	Secretary Tao loses a few points in a row, and Wu Xiankang takes advantage of the momentum to attack fiercely, smashing the ball. The situation on the court suddenly becomes tense. One comrade, watching anxiously from the side, can't help but shout: "Secretary Tao, Wu Xiankang is playing with his left hand, you have to smash to the right!" Secretary Tao smiles and smashes to the right a few times in a row, and it works! The balls that Wu Xiankang returns either go out of bounds or hit the net, and the score soars.

	The competition ends in a joyful atmosphere, and Wu Xiankang finally wins. The people around who watched the game feel extremely happy. They not only saw an exciting ping-pong match, but also deeply felt that the Party Secretary lives among them intimately.

	Dragon and Tiger Fight
	In front of the bulletin board at the East Gate, advanced producers and cadres form two walls of people, shouting loudly. The tug-of-war competition of the cool evening party is taking place here. The first match is between Yan Chunhui's group from the hull workshop and Wu Xiankang's group from the installation workshop. These two groups are both national advanced collectives, each with their own strengths in production. This tug-of-war is also a dragon and tiger fight. Who will win? People are concerned about this issue.

	The athletes of Wu Xiankang's group put on straw sandals one by one to ensure that they can exert force better under their feet. The warriors of Yan Chunhui's group are wearing work clothes, having just gotten off work and not yet changed or showered, and rushed over in a hurry. The members of Yan Chunhui's group are all burly, and the audience on both sides is worried about Wu Xiankang's group. Unexpectedly, Wu Xiankang's group wins two to zero, relying on skill to overcome their opponents. Our advanced producers have a variety of abilities to subdue dragons and tigers in production, and also have diverse hobbies in cultural and sports activities. The cool evening party has singing, storytelling, Shanghai opera, Yue opera, magic and other programs performed by advanced collectives, as well as chess performances, music appreciation, and open-air movies, which are truly rich and colorful. This evening on the 9th eliminated everyone's fatigue from the past week, enabling everyone to invest more energetically in the high tide of the continued great leap forward.

    乘凉晚会
    夏夜，凉风习习。上海江南造船厂工会大楼前枝叶茂盛的梧桐树上，挂满了一串串的红绿电灯。全厂先进集体和先进生产者结束了一周愉快而紧张的劳动，同领导干部一起在这里欢度周末，举行乘凉晚会。
    干部工人一齐表演
    在第一食堂右侧的草坪上，高高的露天舞台吸引着人群。有的坐在长凳上，有的站在四周围。他们全神贯注地看着舞台上领导干部和工人一起表演的各种节目。草坪上鼓掌声、谈笑声，时起时伏。
    报幕员宣布：“下面是轮机车间女工大合唱。指挥：党总支副书记郑杏泉，手风琴伴奏：工会主席忻志芳。”话音一落，掌声四起。“社会主义好”二部合唱开始了，党总支副书记郑杏泉的两臂越挥越有劲，演唱的女工越唱越宏亮，伴奏的工会主席忻志芳越拉越动听，台下一片叫好声。这个车间的车间主任周三友手里抱着一个孩子，坐在最后一排的凳子上笑呵呵地望着。原来，他看到党总支副书记上台做指挥，工会主席拉手风琴，他就帮助上台演唱的女工同志带孩子。领导干部和广大群众心情欢畅，欢乐气氛到处洋溢。书记和先进生产者赛乒乓
    绿树复盖的柏油马路上，人们围得水泄不通。党委书记陶力和全国先进生产者邬显康正在乒乓球台前挥拍大战。陶书记人高臂长左右开弓，邬显康机动灵活伺机猛抽，两个人打得难解难分。周围看球的人越来越多，后边的人看不清楚，索性搬来一些砖头垫着脚看。
    陶书记连失几个球，邬显康乘胜猛攻，大板抽杀，场上突然紧张起来。有一位同志在旁边看得急了，不禁大声喊道：“陶书记，邬显康用左手打，要向右边抽呀！”陶书记笑了笑，接连向右边猛抽几记，果然很灵，邬显康回过来的球不是出界就是落网，积分扶摇直上。
    比赛在欢乐的气氛中结束，邬显康终于获胜。周围看球的人都感到无比欢乐，他们不仅看到一场精彩的乒乓赛，而且深深体会到党委书记和他们亲密无间地生活在一起。
    龙虎相斗
    东大门黑板报前，先进生产者和干部们围成二道人墙，喊声震天。乘凉晚会的拔河比赛就在这里进行。第一场是船体车间严纯辉小组对安装车间邬显康小组。这两个小组都是全国先进集体，在生产上各有千秋。这次拔河赛也是一场龙虎相斗。谁胜谁负？人们都关心着这个问题。
    邬显康小组的健儿们一个个穿上草鞋，保证脚底下能更好地使劲。严纯辉小组的勇士们穿着工作服，刚下班还没更衣洗浴，就匆匆赶来。严纯辉小组一个个身材魁梧，两旁观众齐为邬显康小组担心。不料，邬显康小组却以二比零取胜，他们靠技巧胜过了对方。我们的先进生产者们，在生产上有多种多样擒龙伏虎的本领，在文娱、体育活动方面也有多方面的爱好。乘凉晚会上有先进集体演出的歌咏、说唱、沪剧、越剧、魔术等节目，有象棋表演，有音乐欣赏，还有露天电影，真是丰富多彩。9日这个晚会消除了大家一周来的疲劳，使大家更加精力充沛地投入持续跃进的高潮。
