Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 26th: More than 1,100 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, who returned home on the "Russia" ship, arrived in Nanning from Zhanjiang on the 25th.

At the station, the returned overseas Chinese were warmly welcomed by Li Long, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lu Xiuxuan, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ding Ming, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Autonomous Region, and people from all walks of life in Nanning.

Most of these returned overseas Chinese came from West Java. They expressed great anger at the atrocities committed by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia in massacring overseas Chinese women. Some of them wore black紗 on their arms. As soon as they got off the train, they exposed to their compatriots who came to welcome them the crimes of the West Java military authorities in instigating the Chima圩 massacre. The returned overseas Chinese expressed infinite gratitude for the warm reception and care from the motherland. Some shook hands tightly with the people who came to welcome them and repeatedly stated that they would use their greatest strength to work with the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi to build the motherland more beautifully.

    又一批归侨在广西安家
    新华社南宁26日电　一千一百多名乘“俄罗斯号”船回国的印度尼西亚归侨，25日从湛江到达南宁。
    归侨们在车站上，受到了中共广西僮族自治区委员会统战部副部长李隆、政协自治区委员会副主席陆秀轩、自治区华侨事务委员会副主任丁明等负责人及南宁市各界人民的热烈欢迎。
    这批归侨大部分来自西爪哇，他们对印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局残杀华侨妇女的暴行表示非常愤怒，有的人手臂上还带着黑纱，一下火车就向前来欢迎的同胞揭露西爪哇军事当局策动芝马圩惨案的罪行。归侨们对祖国的热情接待和关怀表示无限感激，有的与前来欢迎的人紧紧握手，一再表示要用最大的力量和广西各族人民一起，把祖国建设得更美丽。
