    The Entire Party Must Focus on Agriculture
    Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Agriculture Must Be the Primary Task
    The idea of taking "agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor," and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture is a major development of Marxist political economy by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Practical experience over the past few years has proven that this is a correct guideline for implementing the general line of socialist construction in our country and ensuring that our economic construction can develop both at a high speed and in a proportional manner.
    The Party Central Committee vividly refers to this policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously as the policy of "walking on two legs," which is both simple and profound. "Walking on two legs" mainly refers to the fact that the two basic sectors of the national economy—industry and agriculture—should develop simultaneously and be closely integrated, rather than one-sidedly emphasizing industry while neglecting agriculture, or simply emphasizing agriculture while neglecting industry; both of these deviations are metaphysical viewpoints.
    However, it is not enough to understand it in this way alone. It must be further understood that "simultaneous development" does not mean using equal force at all times; rather, in terms of the use of force and work arrangements during a certain period, there should be a priority and a secondary aspect for the two simultaneously developed areas, and one of them should be placed in the primary position as the focus of the time. Moreover, this position can shift from one to the other in different periods. This is in line with the dialectics of objective development. Because industry and agriculture are both contradictory and unified parts of the national economy, they are both of great importance to the national economy, and there is a relationship of mutual unity and interdependence between them, so they must be developed simultaneously so that the entire national economy can achieve high-speed development. However, there are also contradictions between them, and the two sides of the contradiction are always unbalanced, and in a certain period and under certain conditions, only one of them can be the main aspect of the contradiction. While acknowledging simultaneous development is different from the metaphysical viewpoint of only acknowledging one aspect, if it is not acknowledged that there should be a focus in different periods, and that the use of force and work arrangements should have a priority and a sequence, then the most important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's doctrine of contradiction, and dialectics, will be abandoned in practical work.
    In the past few years, China's economic construction has been carried out under the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, with industry, especially heavy industry, as the focus. It was entirely correct to do so in the past. In a country like ours, which was "poor and blank," the entire socialist economic construction would not be able to proceed smoothly without concentrating efforts to quickly establish a certain foundation of heavy industry. At the same time, because the land reform had already been completed at this time, and then successively completed a series of profound social changes such as cooperativization and people's communes, the great potential of the 500 million farmers who were liberated from the shackles of backward relations of production was fully utilized, and agriculture had already begun to develop rapidly, enabling us to focus on developing heavy industry and concentrate our efforts to establish a certain foundation of heavy industry. The situation is different now. After several years of efforts, especially after the continuous Great Leap Forward in the previous two years, this year, heavy industry has laid a certain foundation, and industrial development has been rapid, creating an unprecedented situation. In terms of agriculture, there has also been a continuous leap forward in the past few years, providing huge support to industry with grain and raw materials. In particular, the massive amount of labor force drawn from the agricultural front to support industry during this period is an important guarantee for industry to develop at such a high speed. Taking Guangdong as an example, since the autumn of 1958, when millions of people went to the mountains to smelt steel, the agricultural front has transferred over a million strong laborers to strengthen the industrial front above the county level, and the people's communes also have hundreds of thousands of strong laborers engaged in mining, processing, and manufacturing, providing raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products for national industry. If agriculture itself had not achieved a huge leap forward, it would be unimaginable to use such a large force to support industry. However, the growth rate of industry is, after all, much higher than that of agriculture. The high-speed development of industry, especially heavy industry, has put forward higher demands on agriculture. However, the development of agriculture still mainly relies on changes in production relations and people's mental outlook, and has not had time to systematically carry out technological transformation with the strong support of industry, which has created a situation where, although agriculture has made great progress, it still cannot keep up with the demands of industry, which is developing at a higher speed. With heavy industry already having laid a certain foundation, the backwardness of agriculture is even more prominent. This backward agriculture has become the main aspect of the contradiction at present, so it is necessary to shift the focus to agriculture for a certain period of time (for example, several years), with agriculture as the primary task. Fully utilizing the existing industrial base, accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture, and changing the backward state of agriculture as soon as possible. To be specific, this means that in terms of the leadership's attention, the use of various forces including human, material, and financial resources, and work arrangements, agriculture should be placed in the primary position. Industrial production and industrial capital construction should also first start from serving agriculture and supporting agriculture. Only in this way can the further development and sustained leap forward of the entire national economy, including heavy industry, be reliably guaranteed, without being dragged down by the backward agriculture. If this is not done today, but the focus of work is continued to be placed on industry, a large amount of labor force is continued to be drawn from the agricultural front, and the distribution of raw materials is not first used to meet the needs of agriculture and the industrial production and capital construction that directly serve agriculture, but is first used for general industrial production and capital construction, pushing the industrial production and capital construction that mainly serve agriculture to the distant future, the result will be to sharpen the problem of agricultural backwardness and hinder the development of industry and the entire national economy, which is of course not acceptable. If, in the next few years starting from now, the focus is truly shifted to agriculture, and agriculture is taken as the primary task, after several years of solid efforts, the backwardness of agriculture has been significantly improved, and the technological transformation of agriculture has laid a preliminary foundation, then we can turn around and shift the focus back to industry and develop industry even more. This kind of mutual support and alternating progress of industry and agriculture, as a manifestation of the development of the national economy, is in line with the objective laws of national economic development. Therefore, after agriculture supported the Great Leap Forward in industry in the previous few years, now it should be the time for industry to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture.
    Supporting Agriculture Is the Sacred Task of Industry
    Since agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and thus the common foundation of industry and other industries, supporting agriculture and making the foundation on which it develops stronger cannot but be the sacred task that industry and other industries must bear at all times. Especially in the current new situation, when the entire Party has placed the focus of its work on agriculture, industry must more prominently take supporting agriculture as its primary task.
    Industry is now in a position to support agriculture with greater force. After the First Five-Year Plan and the subsequent three consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, China's industry, especially heavy industry, has established a certain foundation. By the end of this year, the national steel production will reach more than 18 million tons. Guangdong, which was originally blank in terms of heavy industry, has established a preliminary foundation for the steel and machinery industry. Using the already established industrial base to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, and using more industrial raw materials to support agriculture, so that agriculture can catch up, is both for the sake of agriculture and to create conditions for industry to continue to leap forward on a new foundation.
    What does agriculture require of industry? First of all, it requires two things: first, the industrial sector must practically take supporting agriculture as its primary task, and truly prioritize the arrangement and development of production related to agriculture, and guarantee the supply of materials for these production projects. Second, it requires appropriately compressing industrial capital construction and freeing up a portion of raw materials to support agriculture. These two requirements cannot be considered too high, and it should be said that this is the minimum requirement for implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the primary task. In the past, the industrial and planning departments of Guangdong Province have made considerable efforts in supporting agriculture, but compared with the needs, there is still a long way to go, and greater efforts are needed. To truly implement this spirit to the end, a thorough ideological work is also needed. It must be seen that some leaders of departments and enterprises are not clear about the position of agriculture in China's economic construction, the relationship between industry and agriculture, and the obligations that industry should fulfill for the development of agriculture. Without carrying out thorough ideological education, criticizing some confused ideas and erroneous understandings, and thoroughly solving the ideological understanding of taking agriculture as the foundation, it will be difficult to implement the policy of the entire Party taking agriculture as the primary task.
    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that from now until 1962, the province's industry will use great efforts to support agriculture, and provide agriculture with production materials for ten major projects such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, automobiles, drainage and irrigation power, diesel engines, generators, synthetic rubber, cement, and small-scale iron and steel joint enterprise equipment. This is a comprehensive, huge, and historically significant deployment of Guangdong's industrial support for agriculture. The promotion effect and far-reaching impact on the development of agriculture in Guangdong Province are currently impossible to estimate. These ten major projects can be summarized into three aspects:
    First, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical fertilizer is the most urgently needed in agricultural production at present. As the masses say, "Guaranteed production depends on water, increased production depends on fertilizer." With the gradual improvement of water conservancy conditions and the gradual reduction of the instability of agricultural production, fertilizer is increasingly becoming the most important measure for increasing agricultural production. In a certain sense, Guangdong's agriculture needs chemical fertilizer more urgently than tractors, and requires the industrial sector to arrange it as the first project to support agriculture, and immediately adopt the policy of combining large, medium, and small, and mainly small and medium-sized, to vigorously develop the chemical fertilizer industry. The planning, materials, and capital construction departments must ensure the smooth completion of the capital construction tasks of the fertilizer plant and put it into production as soon as possible. Pesticides should also adopt the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and starting with indigenous methods, to manufacture them in large quantities.
    Second, various agricultural machinery and power. Equipping agriculture with modern technology on a large scale is the fundamental measure to completely change the backward state of agricultural production. Although the complete realization of this great ideal still depends on the further development of heavy industry, and still requires a certain amount of time, "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." At present, we must not relax our efforts in improving tools and semi-mechanization at all. What should be done and can be done today should never be postponed until tomorrow. The experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past three years has profoundly shown that industry cannot gradually transfer more labor from the rural areas to the industrial front without gradually equipping agriculture with modern technology. "If you want to take it, you must first give it." The industrial front actually needs to exchange it for considerable agricultural machinery and power in order to transfer labor from the agricultural front. Moreover, it is necessary to give before transferring, give more and transfer less, otherwise agriculture will be affected. Doing so is also of great benefit to industry: first, it will build a solid agricultural base for itself; second, it will cultivate a strong labor reserve for itself; third, it will force itself to think of ways to solve the labor shortage more from the aspects of technological innovation and technological revolution. Therefore, the support of industry to agriculture in terms of machinery and power is actually opening up a broad source of labor for industry itself. This support of industry to agriculture is multifaceted. At present, in addition to trying to produce a part of tractors, generators, and power machinery, it is also necessary to highlight the transportation tools, try to produce some automobiles and motorized boats, especially to produce a large number of various human and animal-drawn rubber-tired vehicles, which is the most realistic and effective measure to improve agricultural labor productivity and liberate a large number of laborers.
    Third, help the special districts, counties, and communes to establish a set of industrial systems that directly serve agriculture, the "small foreign groups" and "medium foreign groups." This is an important position for industrial support to agriculture, and also a strategic measure to massively develop medium and small-scale industries through supporting agriculture. The entire Party must treat this task with the greatest enthusiasm. Due to the complexity of agricultural production, the requirements of agriculture to industry are diverse; at the same time, various industrial raw materials are spread throughout the rural areas of the province. Vigorously running medium and small-scale foreign group enterprises can, on the one hand, widely adapt to the requirements of agricultural production, and on the other hand, take materials locally and fully utilize the potential and local enthusiasm in this regard.
    The Agricultural Front Must Make Greater Efforts
    Industrial support for agriculture is very important. However, to quickly change the current backward state of agriculture, it ultimately depends on greater efforts by the agricultural front itself. "External causes work through internal causes." Industrial support must exert great power through the implementation of various correct measures in agricultural production. All cadres on the agricultural front and all members of the rural people's communes must not therefore develop dependent thinking, sit back and wait for industrial support, and relax their own efforts.
    The overall situation on the agricultural front is very good. The reason why we have repeatedly mentioned the backward state of agricultural production earlier is only in comparison with industry and in comparison with the demands of national economic development on agriculture. If we can face up to this backward state and take correct measures with the strong support of industry, and prominently solve several key issues, we will definitely be able to make agriculture catch up with full power and create a brand new situation.
    What are the key issues that need to be prominently solved in agricultural production at present?
    First, sufficient labor must be used to enrich the front line of agricultural production. In recent years, there have been great changes in the allocation of rural labor. The general situation is that the number of people transferred from agriculture to industrial and mining enterprises, from grain production to diversified operations, and from the production front line to the logistics departments has greatly increased. That is to say, a large number of laborers have left agricultural production, especially grain production, and transferred to industrial and mining enterprises above the county level, commune enterprises, and brigade professional teams, as well as logistics teams. In addition, too many cadres have left production, and the cadres at the team level have not gone deep into production enough, and primary schools have enrolled a batch of over-aged students, which has made the labor force on the front line of agricultural production appear extremely tight. A large part of the above-mentioned labor transfer is completely necessary, but a considerable part is unnecessary. Of course, the situation of 500 million farmers struggling to make a living must eventually be changed, and a large part of the rural labor force will sooner or later become industrial labor; however, this change can only be a gradual process. Under the conditions that the level of agricultural production is still very low, it is unfavorable to withdraw too much, too early, and too urgently labor from the front line of agricultural production.
    In order to be able to use sufficient labor to enrich the front line of agricultural production, that is, to enrich the field operation teams of the production teams, the main measures are: appropriately compress county and commune industries to enrich agriculture; rectify and improve the teams of diversified operations of communes and brigades to strengthen production teams; rectify the logistics teams to enrich the production front line. At the same time, commune industries should implement the system of being both workers and farmers, engaging in industry during slack farming seasons and returning to agriculture during busy farming seasons; commune and brigade sideline production should be engaged in more during slack farming seasons and less during busy farming seasons; logistics teams should make full use of incidental labor or semi-labor, and should implement comprehensive management and mutual cooperation methods. In addition, laborers who have flowed into urban industrial and mining areas outside the plan should be mobilized to return to their hometowns; over-aged primary school students over the age of sixteen should be persuaded to transfer to study in spare time schools; most cadres of brigades and all cadres of teams must not leave production; cadres who leave production must participate in labor in accordance with quotas, etc. In carrying out this work, prevent simple, crude, and whirlwind-like practices. Conduct thorough political and ideological education and meticulous investigation and research. Commune enterprises and the professional teams for diversified operations of brigades must improve business management, vigorously reform tools, and improve labor efficiency. In short, as a result of the return of labor, the front line should be greatly strengthened, and production in other areas should also be generally developed. In the next few years, the rural labor force should be largely stabilized and should not be transferred in large numbers. Industrial and mining enterprises should mainly rely on internal rectification and improvement, and rely on technological innovation and technological revolution to solve the problem of labor shortage. At present, the province has entered the busy season of summer harvesting and summer planting. All regions and industries should first temporarily organize and mobilize a large number of laborers to directly go to the production teams to help with summer harvesting and summer planting, quickly strengthen the production front line, and then carry out a comprehensive rectification of the labor force in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    Second, it is necessary to vigorously expand the area of cultivated land, fully utilize and highly conserve cultivated land, and ensure that agricultural production has sufficient land. It can be seen from some typical investigations that the yield per unit area of some brigades and communes has increased rapidly, but the total output has increased slowly, mainly because the area of cultivated land has decreased. The construction of water conservancy, industrial and mining, and transportation projects, as well as the construction of communes and production brigades, have all occupied a part of the cultivated land, and most of them are paddy fields, near fields, and good fields. Due to insufficient labor and improper arrangements, some remote mountain fields have also been abandoned. In recent years, although the area of wasteland reclamation and dry land converted to paddy fields has been very large, it has expanded on one side and decreased on the other side. The expansion has been less than the decrease, and the expansion has been barren land, while the decrease has been good fields. This phenomenon deserves our serious attention.
    The issue of area and yield per unit area is the center of agricultural production, and we have had very rich experience in the past few years. Generally speaking, before 1957, we focused on solving the area problem, and the main measures were: promoting single cropping to double cropping; advocating three crops a year; implementing intercropping and relay intercropping; and wasteland reclamation. As a result, millions of mu of single-cropping fields were transformed, the area of winter planting increased more than doubled, and intercropping and relay intercropping were highly implemented, which greatly improved the land utilization rate; at the same time, a lot of cultivated land was added. Like the Chenqiao Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Chao'an County at that time, with only seven fen of land per person, it could also become a surplus grain cooperative. After 1958, we focused on solving the problem of yield per unit area. Encouraged by the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, 30 million farmers in the province launched a great revolution in cultivation technology that had never been seen before. Everyone engaged in experiments, everywhere competed for high yields, vying with each other, you chased me, and achieved very fruitful results. The technical problems of a large area of mu yielding 700 to 800 jin, a medium area yielding 1,000 jin, a small area yielding 1,500 jin, and individual experimental fields yielding more than 2,000 jin per mu were solved. In the past, farmers' fantasies and scientists' assumptions suddenly became a reality.
    Reviewing this period of history is of great significance. It shows that we have had rich experience in the two fundamental measures of agricultural production, namely expanding the area and increasing the yield per unit area. As long as we fully use the experience and skills in these two aspects in future production, we will definitely be able to achieve both more planting and high yields, and achieve a great increase in total output. At present, it is necessary to strongly emphasize cherishing land and strictly prevent the behavior of wasting land. Industrial and mining, water conservancy, and other capital construction should try not to occupy or occupy as little cultivated land as possible; land requisition must be greatly compressed; abandoned land must be fully planted; land must not be used as flower beds and gardens unrelated to production; five-edge land, reservoirs, irrigation canals, dikes, and leveled land must be fully utilized; the area of multiple cropping, intercropping, and relay intercropping must be greatly increased, especially winter planting and single cropping to double cropping must be vigorously grasped. In addition, we must do everything possible to reclaim wasteland for cultivation and expand planting, transform the irrigation system, and increase the area of paddy fields. In the next two or three years, not only must the planting area of cash crops be expanded, but the area of grain cultivated land occupied by each person must also be increased.
    Third, on the basis of fully implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, highlight fertilizer and improved varieties. Fertilizer and improved varieties are the most important measures for rapidly increasing yield per unit area in most areas of the province in the future. In the past, we have always emphasized that water and fertilizer are the two key measures for increasing production. In recent years, we have done a great job in water conservancy. Especially last winter and this spring, the province has built hundreds of key projects benefiting more than 10,000 mu alone. At present, water conservancy in most areas has a preliminary foundation. In comparison, fertilizer is far behind. Therefore, in the future, most areas should shift their main efforts from water conservancy to fertilizer and overcome the situation where fertilizer lags behind water conservancy. This is of decisive significance for the great harvest of agriculture. In addition to fertilizer, we must vigorously grasp improved varieties. Under the conditions of water and fertilizer, improved varieties can achieve the most significant and economical production increase effect. The potential and hope in this regard are great. The work of promoting improved varieties in various places has just begun, and it has already proved its great effect.
    Fourth, continue to develop and strengthen commodity bases for diversified agricultural operations. After the labor force returns to the team, the grain production front will definitely be greatly strengthened. At this time, diversified operations must not be weakened, and must be developed and strengthened. The production of commune farms and brigade professional teams that have been established must be consolidated and developed on the basis of rectifying the labor force, improving business management, and improving labor efficiency. One direction for the development of diversified commodity production is to develop and strengthen commodity bases. With the help of the state, the original old commodity bases must be quickly restored, and a large number of new commodity bases must be established in order to change the phenomenon that the total output of some products has increased but the commodity rate has not increased accordingly. Especially in the case of vigorously running public canteens throughout the province and striving to improve people's living standards, we must better grasp commodity production, otherwise we will make mistakes. The current trend in rural production and life is: organizing production by brigade, organizing people's lives by team (canteen), requiring the canteen to gradually develop self-sufficiency in production, and basically achieve self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods. In order to better exert the potential of the team, so that the team can be fully self-sufficient and the brigade can provide a large number of commodities, various places can consider strengthening the production responsibility of the team. In addition to vegetables that have been handed over to the canteen for production, the self-sufficient production of oil crops, live pigs, and three kinds of poultry can also be the responsibility of the team, allowing the brigade professional team to concentrate its efforts to specialize in commodity production. County and commune farms are important bases for developing commodity production and have strong vitality. They should be strengthened in leadership and run well.
    In order to rapidly change the backward state of agriculture, it is necessary to thoroughly change the work style of cadres. All rural work cadres must be solid promoters. In recent years, there has been great progress in the work style of cadres; however, there are still some problems. These problems in work style can be mainly attributed to two: how to correctly treat difficulties; and how to correctly treat the masses. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly taught us: strategically, we must despise difficulties, and tactically, we must attach great importance to difficulties. A promoter must be a revolutionary fighter with courage, knowledge, confidence, hard work, and solidity; a braggart who is ignorant and full of empty talk can never be a true promoter. Only solidity can be a good promoter, and only a promoter can be truly solid. This is the conclusion. For example, in agricultural production, how should we correctly understand the relationship between small-area high-yield fields and large-area general fields, and the relationship between production stability and instability? It is not a promotion if one cannot see that the current small-area high-yield fields are the direction of agricultural development in the future; large areas will always follow the path of small-area high-yield fields. However, there is a distance between small areas and large areas; large areas must undergo a lot of work to improve to the high-yield level of small areas. It is not a solid promotion if one does not see this. The fact of high-yield in small areas shows that difficulties should be despised, but the difficulties existing in the process of generally improving large areas must be seriously treated and overcome one by one. The same is true for dealing with the instability of agricultural production. Agricultural production is greatly affected by natural conditions and there is instability. Just because of this, a lot of farmland infrastructure construction is needed to gradually stabilize it. However, within a certain period of time, this instability is only decreasing and cannot be completely overcome, so the planned indicators cannot be fully calculated and must be left with room for maneuver. All of these show that objective laws can be fully understood, but there needs to be a process, and from a few people recognizing and mastering objective laws to most people recognizing and mastering objective laws, there needs to be another process. A solid promotion is to see that objective laws can be recognized and mastered by most people, and also to see that all of these require a process, so as to promote the rapid realization of this process through their own efforts. All rural work cadres must establish a correct attitude towards the masses and always pay attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Under the socialist system, the people have incalculable enthusiasm, but to fully give play to the enthusiasm of the people, it is also necessary to constantly adjust the relationship between the leadership and the masses and must follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong: always care about the lives of the masses and pay attention to work methods. We oppose one-sided emphasis on material incentives and advocate politics first; however, we must always pay attention to caring about the lives of the masses. Currently speaking, we must first earnestly run public canteens well and truly achieve oil and vegetables, eat well and eat well. Cadres must appear in the posture of ordinary laborers and treat people with an equal attitude. Eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses embody the work style and work methods of our party's mass line; this fine tradition must be earnestly and practically promoted on the basis of the rectification of communes.

    全党大抓农业
    中共广东省委书记处书记　赵紫阳
    必须以农业为第一位任务
    以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业同迅速发展农业相互结合的思想，是党中央和毛泽东同志对于马克思主义政治经济学的重大发展。几年来的实践证明，这是一条贯彻执行我国的社会主义建设总路线，保证我国经济建设能够既高速度又按比例发展的正确方针。
    党中央把这个工农业并举的方针喻为“两条腿走路”的方针，真是通俗生动，寓意深刻。“两条腿走路”，主要地是指国民经济的两个基本部门——工业和农业应当同时发展，密切结合，而不要片面强调工业而忽视农业，或单纯强调农业而忽视工业；这两种偏向都是形而上学的观点。
    但是，仅仅这样来理解还不够。还必须进一步理解：所谓“并举”，并不是任何时候都是均衡地使用力量的意思；而是在一定时期里，在力量使用、工作安排上，对同时并举的两者，应该有先后、主次之分，两者当中，应该有一个作为当时的重点，摆在首要的地位。而且这个位置在不同时期是会相互转换的。这是符合客观事物发展的辩证法的。因为工业同农业是国民经济中又矛盾又统一的两个部分，它们在国民经济中都具有极大的重要性，两者间有着互相统一、互相依存的关系，因此必须同时并举，使整个国民经济获得高速度的发展；但它们互相间又是有矛盾的，矛盾的双方总是不平衡的，在一个时期内和一定条件下，两者之中只能有一个是矛盾的主要方面。承认并举，虽然已经同只承认一个方面的形而上学的观点区别开来，但是如果不承认在不同的时期内，应当有重点，在力量使用和工作安排上有先有后，这就否认了矛盾的主要方面，在实际工作中离开了毛泽东同志的矛盾学说的最重要部分，离开了辩证法。
    我国的经济建设在过去几年来，是在执行工业农业并举的方针下，以工业特别是以重工业为重点的。过去这样做是完全正确的。在我国这样一个“一穷二白”的国家里，如不集中力量迅速建立起重工业的一定基础，整个社会主义的经济建设就会无法顺利进行。同时，由于这时已完成了土改，并在这个期间内继而完成了合作化、人民公社化这样一系列的深刻的社会变革，充分发挥了从落后的生产关系束缚下解放出来的五亿农民的伟大潜力，农业已经开始得到了迅速的发展，使我们也有可能把重点放到发展重工业上，集中力量来建立重工业的一定基础。现在的情况已经不同了。经过几年来的努力，特别是经过前年、去年和今年的连续大跃进，重工业已经打下了一定的基础，工业发展神速，开创了史无前例的局面。农业方面，几年来也出现了连续跃进的局面，用粮食、原料对工业进行了巨大的支援，特别是在这期间从农业战线抽出了巨量的劳动力来支援工业，更是工业能够以如此高的速度向前发展的重要保证。仅就广东来说，从1958年秋季数百万人上山大炼钢铁以来，农业战线就已经抽调了上百万精壮的劳动力去加强县以上的工业战线，人民公社内部还有百数十万强劳动力从事于采掘、加工和制造工作，为国家工业提供原料、半成品和成品。如果农业本身没有取得巨大的跃进，要用这样大的力量来支援工业，是不可想像的。但是，工业增长的速度毕竟比农业要高得多，工业特别是重工业的高速度发展，对农业已经提出了更高的要求；而农业的发展至今还主要是依靠生产关系和人们精神面貌的变化，还没有来得及在工业的大力支援下系统地进行技术改造，这就造成了这样一种形势：虽然农业有了很大的发展，但仍然赶不上发展速度更高的工业的要求，而在重工业已经打下了一定基础的情况下，农业的落后又显得突出起来了，这个落后的农业在当前也就成了矛盾的主要方面，所以，有必要在一定的时间（例如几年）内，把重点转到农业上来，以农业作为第一位任务，充分运用已有的工业基础，加速农业技术改造，尽快地改变农业的落后状况。具体些说，这就是要在领导的注意力方面，在各种力量包括人力、物力、财力的使用方面和工作的安排方面，都把农业放在首要地位。工业生产和工业的基本建设，也都首先要从为农业服务、支援农业出发。只有这样，今后整个国民经济包括重工业的进一步发展和持续的跃进，才有了可靠的保证，而不致被落后的农业这条腿拖住。今天如果不这样做，而是继续把工作重点放在工业方面，继续从农业战线抽调大量劳动力，在原材料的分配上，不是首先满足农业和直接为农业服务的工业生产和基建的需要，而是首先用于一般的工业生产和基建，把主要为农业服务的工业生产和基建推到遥远的将来，其结果将是使农业落后的问题尖锐化起来，妨害工业和整个国民经济的发展，那当然是不行的。如果从现在开始的今后几年内，把重点真正转到农业上来，把农业作为第一位任务，经过几年扎扎实实的努力，农业落后的情况有了显著的改善，农业的技术改造打下了初步基础之后，我们就又可以回过头来把重点重新转到工业上来，更大的发展工业。这样工农业互相支撑、互相交替地前进，作为国民经济发展的一种表现形式，是符合国民经济发展的客观规律的。因此在前几年农业支援了工业的大跃进以后，现在应当是工业反过来支援农业大跃进的时候了。
    支援农业是工业的神圣任务
    既然农业是国民经济的基础，也就是工业和其他各业的共同基础，因此支援农业，使自己赖以发展的基础更加壮大起来，不能不是工业和其他各业在任何时候都要负担的神圣任务。特别是在目前的新形势下，全党把工作重心放在农业上来，工业就更必须突出地把支援农业当做自己的第一位的任务担当起来。
    工业用更大的力量来支援农业，目前已经具备了条件。经过第一个五年计划和以后连续三年的大跃进，我国的工业特别是重工业已经建立了一定的基础。到今年底，全国钢产量将达到一千八百多万吨，原来在重工业方面一片空白的广东，已经建立起了钢铁和机械工业的初步基础。用已经建立起来的工业基础支援农业大跃进，工业原材料多用来去支援农业，让农业赶上来，这既是为了农业，也是为使工业能在新的基础上继续跃进创造条件。
    农业对工业有什么要求呢？首先要求做到两点：第一、要求工业部门切实把支援农业作为自己的第一位任务，真正做到优先安排与发展农业有关的生产，保证这些生产项目的材料供应。第二、要求适当压缩工业基本建设，腾出一部分原材料来支援农业。这两个要求不能算太高，应当说，这是贯彻执行以农业为第一位任务这一方针的起码要求。广东省的工业部门和计划部门过去在支援农业方面曾经作了相当的努力，但是同需要比起来，还有很大距离，还需要作更大的努力。而要把这个精神真正贯彻到底，还需要进行一场深入的思想工作。必须看到，有一部分部门和企业的领导人对于我国经济建设中农业的地位，工业和农业的关系，以及工业对农业发展应尽的义务是认识不清楚的。不进行深入的思想教育工作，批判一些糊涂观念和错误认识，彻底解决有关以农业为基础的思想认识问题，要贯彻全党以农业为第一位任务的方针是困难的。
    中共广东省委决定，从现在起到1962年以前，全省工业要用极大力量来支援农业，为农业提供化肥、农药、拖拉机、汽车、排灌动力、柴油机、发电机、合成橡胶、水泥和小型钢铁联合企业设备等十大项目的生产资料。这是广东省工业支援农业的一个全面的、巨大的、具有历史意义的部署，对于广东省农业发展所发生的促进作用和深远影响，目前是无法估计的。这十大项目可以归纳为三个方面：
    第一、化肥、农药。化肥是当前农业生产上最迫切需要的。群众说得好：“保产靠水，增产靠肥。”在水利条件逐渐改善，农业生产的不稳定性逐步减少的情况下，肥料日益成为农业增产的最主要的措施。从一定意义上说，广东省农业需要化肥比拖拉机更加迫切，要求工业部门把它作为支援农业的第一个项目来安排，立即采取大中小三结合和以中小为主的方针，大搞化肥工业。计划、物资、基建等部门一定要保证化肥厂基建任务的顺利完成，早日投入生产。农药也要采取土洋结合、土法上马的方针，大量制造。
    第二、各种农用机具和动力。用现代技术大规模地装备农业，这是彻底改变农业生产落后状况的根本措施。虽然，要全部实现这个伟大理想，还有待于重工业的进一步发展，还需要一定的时间，但是，“千里之行始于足下”，目前我们丝毫也不能放松对改良工具和半机械化的努力。今天应当做和可以做的事情也绝不要推到明天。三年来大跃进的经验深刻地说明：工业不逐步用现代技术装备农业，就不可能逐步从农村转移更多的劳动力到工业战线上来。“将欲取之，必先予之”，工业战线要从农业战线抽调劳动力，实际上是需要用相当的农业机具和动力与之交换的。而且要先给后调，多给少调，否则农业就要受到影响。这样做，对工业也有极大好处：一、将为自己建设一个雄厚的农业基础；二、将为自己培养一个强大的劳动力后备。三、将逼使自己更多地从技术革新和技术革命方面想办法解决劳动力的困难。因此，工业在机具和动力方面对农业的支援，实际上也就是为工业本身开辟广阔的劳动力的源泉。工业对农业的这种支援是多方面的。目前除了尽量生产一部分拖拉机、发电机和动力机械外，还应当突出抓运输工具，尽量生产一些汽车和机动船，特别是应当大量生产各种人力和畜力牵引的胶轮车，这对提高农业劳动生产率，解放大批劳动力是最现实最有效的一项措施。
    第三、帮助专区、县、公社建立一套直接为农业服务的“小洋群”、“中洋群”的工业体系。这是工业支援农业的重要阵地，也是通过支援农业来大量发展中、小型工业的战略措施。全党必须用最大热情来对待这一任务。由于农业生产的复杂性，农业向工业提出的要求是多种多样的；同时，各种工业原料又遍布于全省农村。大办中、小洋群企业，一方面可以广泛适应农业生产的要求，一方面又可以就地取材，充分发挥这方面的潜力和地方的积极性。
    农业战线必须作更大的努力
    工业对农业的支援是十分重要的。但是，要迅速改变目前农业落后的状况，归根到底取决于农业战线本身更大的努力。“外因通过内因起作用”，工业的支援必须通过农业生产上各项正确措施的贯彻，才能发挥巨大的威力。农业战线的全体干部和农村人民公社的全体社员，绝不能因此而发生依赖思想，坐待工业支援，放松本身的努力。
    农业战线整个形势是很好的。前面我们之所以一再提到农业生产的落后状况，只是就它与工业比较、与国民经济的发展对农业的要求比较而言，如果我们能够正视这个落后状况，在工业的大力支援下，采取正确措施，突出地解决几个带关键性的问题，就一定可以使农业开足马力赶上来，开创一个崭新的局面。
    当前农业生产上要突出解决哪几个带关键性的问题呢？
    第一，必须用足够的劳动力去充实农业生产第一线。这几年来，农村劳动力的投放有很大变化。总的情况是：由农业转移到工矿企业、由粮食生产转移到多种经营、由生产前线转移到后勤部门的人大大增多。这就是说，有很大一批劳动力脱离了农业生产特别是粮食生产，转移到县以上工矿企业、公社企业和大队专业队以及后勤队伍。加上脱离生产的干部过多，小队一级干部深入生产不够，小学校招收了一批超龄学生等等，就使农业生产第一线的劳动力显得异常紧张。上述劳动力的转移有很大部分是完全必要的，但是，也有相当一部分是不应该的。当然，五亿农民搞饭吃的局面终究必须改变，农村劳动力当中的很大一部分迟早要变为工业劳动力；但是，这个变化只能是一个逐步发展的过程。在农业生产水平还很低的条件下，过多地、过早地、过急地从农业生产第一线抽走劳动力是不利的。
    为了能够做到用足够的劳动力去充实农业生产第一线，即充实生产小队的田间作业队伍，主要措施是：适当压缩县和公社工业，充实农业；整顿提高公社和大队多种经营的队伍，加强生产小队；整顿后勤队伍，充实生产第一线。同时，公社工业实行亦工亦农制度，农闲搞工业，农忙回去搞农业；公社及大队的副业生产应当农闲多搞，农忙少搞；后勤队伍应充分利用附带劳动或半劳动，并且应当实行综合经营相互协作的方法。此外，计划外流入城市工矿的劳动力要动员回乡；十六岁以上的超龄小学生要劝说其转读业余学校；大队大部分干部和小队全部干部一律不得脱离生产；脱离生产干部一律按照定额参加劳动等等。进行这一工作，要防止简单粗糙、刮一阵风的作法。要进行充分的政治思想教育，细致的调查研究。公社企业和大队多种经营的专业队要改善经营管理，大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率。总之，劳动力归队的结果，第一线要大大加强，其他方面的生产也要普遍得到发展。今后几年，农村劳动力应当大体上稳定下来，不要大量调动。工矿企业应当主要依靠内部的整顿和提高，依靠技术革新和技术革命来解决劳动力不足的问题。目前全省已进入夏收夏种大忙季节，各地区、各行业应当首先临时组织动员一大批劳动力，直接下到生产小队帮助夏收夏种，迅速加强生产第一线，然后再有计划有步骤地全面进行劳动力的整顿。
    第二、必须大抓扩大耕地面积，充分利用和高度节约耕地，保证农业生产有足够的土地。从一些典型调查中可以看到，有些大队和公社，单位面积产量增长很快，但总产量却增长较慢，主要原因是耕地面积减少了。兴建水利、工矿、交通工程、公社和生产大队的建筑都占用了一部分耕地，而且多是水田、近田、好田。由于劳动力不足，安排不当，边远山田也撩荒了一部分。几年来，开荒、旱地改水田的面积虽然很大，但是一边扩大，一边减少，扩大的少，减少的多，扩大的是瘦地，减少的是好田。这种现象值得我们严重注意。
    面积和单产问题是农业生产的中心，几年来我们有着十分丰富的经验。大体说来，1957年以前，我们着重解决面积问题，主要的措施是：推行单造改双造；提倡一年三熟；实行间作套种；开荒。结果，改造了几百万亩单造田，冬种面积增加一倍以上，高度实行间作套种，这些都大大提高了土地利用率；同时又增加了不少的耕地面积。像当时潮安县的陈桥农牧社，每人只有七分地，也能变成余粮社。1958年之后，我们着重解决单产问题。全省三千万农民，在农业“八字宪法”的鼓舞下，开展了一场亘古未有的耕作技术上的伟大革命。人人搞试验，处处争高产，争先恐后，你追我赶，取得了极丰硕的战果。一造大面积亩产七八百斤、中面积亩产千斤、小面积亩产一千五百斤、个别试验田亩产二千斤以上的技术问题解决了。过去农民的幻想，科学家的假设，一下子都变成了现实。
    重温这一段历史有很重要的意义。它表明在农业生产两项带根本性的措施即扩大面积和提高单产方面，我们都有了丰富的经验。只要在今后生产中把这两方面的经验和本领都全部用上，就一定能够做到既多种，又高产，达到大大增加总产量的目的。当前，必须十分强调珍惜土地，严厉制止浪费土地的行为。工矿、水利及其他各项基建应当尽量不占和少占耕地；征用地必须大大压缩；撩荒地必须全部种上；不得以田地辟作与生产无关的花圃、花园；五边地、水库、灌溉渠道、基围、经过平整的土地等，都必须充分利用；复种、套种、间作面积要大大增加，特别是冬种和单造改双造，尤须狠狠抓好。除此之外，还要尽一切可能开荒扩种，改造灌溉系统，增加水田面积。在今后二、三年内，不仅要扩大经济作物的种植面积，而且还要使每人占有的粮食耕地面积有所增加。
    第三、在全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的基础上，突出地抓肥料和良种。肥料和良种是今后全省多数地区迅速提高单产的最主要措施，过去我们一向强调水和肥是增产的两个关键措施。几年来水利方面我们做了巨大的工作，特别是去冬今春全省仅受益万亩以上的重点工程就兴修了几百宗。现在多数地区的水利已经有了一个初步基础，比较之下，肥料却相差很远。因此今后多数地区应当把主要力量从水利转到肥料方面去，克服肥料落后于水利的状况。这对于农业的大丰收有着决定意义。除肥料之外，要大抓良种。在有水有肥的条件下，良种能够起到最显著最经济的增产效果，这一方面的潜力和希望很大。各地推广良种的工作刚刚开始，就已证明它的巨大效果。
    第四、继续发展和加强农业多种经营的商品基地。在劳动力回到小队之后，粮食生产战线一定会大大加强起来。这时，多种经营也绝对不能削弱，必须使之得到发展和加强。已经建立起来的公社农场和大队专业队的生产，在整顿劳动力、改善经营管理、提高劳动效率的基础上，要巩固地发展下去。发展多种经营的商品生产的一个方向，是发展和加强商品基地。在国家的帮助下，原有的老商品基地要迅速恢复起来，新商品基地要大量建立，以改变目前某些产品总产量增加而商品率却没有相应提高的现象。特别是在全省大办公共食堂，努力提高人民生活水平的情况下，一定要更好地抓紧商品生产，不然是要犯错误的。当前农村生产和生活中出现这样的趋势：以大队为单位组织生产，以小队（食堂）为单位组织群众生活，要求食堂逐步发展自给生产，做到主要副食品基本上能够自给。为了更好地发挥小队潜力，做到既能使小队充分自给，又能使大队提供大量商品，各地可以考虑加强小队的生产责任，除蔬菜已交食堂生产之外，将自给性的油料、生猪、三鸟等生产也由小队负责，让大队专业队集中力量专门从事商品生产。县和公社农场是发展商品生产的重要基地，具有强大的生命力，应当加强领导，切实办好。
    为了迅速改变农业的落后状况，必须彻底改变干部作风。所有农村工作干部都要做扎扎实实的促进派。几年来，干部作风确实有很大进步；但是，也还存在着一些问题。这些作风上的问题主要可以归结为两个：如何正确对待困难的问题；如何正确对待群众的问题。党中央和毛泽东同志一再教导我们：战略上要藐视困难，战术上一定要重视困难。促进派必然是有胆有识、胸有成竹、埋头苦干、扎扎实实的革命战士；心中无数、空话连篇的吹牛家决不能做真正的促进派。唯扎扎实实才能当好促进派，唯促进派才能真正扎扎实实。这就是结论。譬如在农业生产上小面积高产田和大面积一般田的关系问题，生产的稳定性与不稳定性的关系问题，应当怎样正确认识呢？看不到目前小面积的高产田是今后农业发展的方向就不是促进派；大面积总是要追随小面积走高产田的道路的。但是，小面积与大面积之间有一段距离；大面积要提高到小面积的高产水平，必须经过许多工作。不看到这一点，就不是扎扎实实的促进派。小面积高产的事实，说明困难是应该藐视的，但是对于大面积普遍提高这个过程中存在的困难则必须严肃对待，一个一个地加以克服。对待农业生产的不稳定性的问题也是如此，农业生产受自然条件的影响很大，存在着不稳定性。正因为如此。所以要进行许多农田基本建设，使之逐步走向稳定。但是，在一定时间内，这种不稳定性毕竟只是在减少，还不可能完全克服，因此，计划指标就不能满打满算，而必须留有余地。所有这些都说明：客观规律是完全可以认识的，但是需要有一个过程，从少数人认识掌握客观规律到多数人认识掌握客观规律，又需要有一个过程。扎扎实实的促进派就是既要看到客观规律可以认识、可以被多数人掌握，又要看到这些都需要有一个过程，从而通过自己的努力，促使这个过程迅速实现。所有的农村工作干部必须树立起一种对待群众的正确态度，时刻注意发挥群众的积极性。在社会主义制度下，人民群众蕴藏着不可估量的积极性，但要把人民群众的积极性充分发挥起来，还必须不断地调节领导和群众之间的关系，必须遵照毛泽东同志的指示：时刻关心群众生活，注意工作方法。我们反对片面强调物质刺激，而主张政治第一；但是，必须时刻注意关心群众的生活。当前说来，我们必须首先切切实实办好公共食堂，真正做到有油有菜，吃饱吃好。干部一定要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，要以平等态度待人。与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，具体地体现了我们党的群众路线的工作作风和工作方法；这种优良作风，必须在整社的基础上认真地切实地加以发扬光大。
