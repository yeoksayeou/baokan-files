Aidit said that his own house, as well as the houses of leaders such as Njoto, Lukman, and Sudisman, had been surrounded since July 14.

According to a message released by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on the evening of the 22nd, Aidit met Sakirman, the Third Deputy Chairman of the National Planning Council and a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, in the interrogation room of the Jakarta Wartime Authority on the 22nd.

    传讯印度尼西亚共产党领导人
    艾地、约多、鲁克曼等人的住房已遭到包围
    据新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚雅加达战时掌权部发言人埃迪中尉今天宣布，雅加达战时掌权部今天和昨天仍在继续“传唤”和“询问”印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地和其他领导人鲁克曼、约多和苏蒂斯曼等人。
    埃迪说，“初步的询问”将继续进行。他又说，他说不上这种“询问”将在什么时候结束。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，埃迪在23日说，军事当局正在对艾地和约多进行“严厉的讯问”，要他们“澄清”这个党的中央委员会政治局7月8日就印度尼西亚工作内阁一年来的工作发表的声明。
    埃迪中尉曾经在22日发表新闻公报说，雅加达战时掌权部是在21日上午开始传讯艾地和约多的。
    艾地21日在最高评议院会议休息时对新闻记者说，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会委员、“合作国会”议员朱义多曾经在16日会见了最高战时掌权部的参谋长，向他询问了关于印度尼西亚共产党领导人的房子被警察局国家安全处的人员和宪兵包围的问题。艾地说，他自己的房子以及约多、鲁克曼、苏蒂斯曼等领导人的房子从7月14日以来都遭到了包围。
    据印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处在22日晚间发表的消息说，艾地22日在雅加达战时掌权部的讯问室内遇到了7月16日被军人带走的国家计划委员会第三副主席、印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员萨基尔曼，萨基尔曼对艾地说，他在被带走以前，并没有接到当局要他去作解释的传唤。
