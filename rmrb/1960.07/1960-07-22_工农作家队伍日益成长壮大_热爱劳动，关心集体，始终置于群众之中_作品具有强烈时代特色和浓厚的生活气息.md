Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch: In the burgeoning mass creative movement in our country, a magnificent worker-peasant writer force is growing stronger day by day.

　　In recent years, the magnificent New Folk Song Movement has swept across the country. According to incomplete statistics from the Folk Literature Research Association, in 1958 alone, publishing institutions at the provincial and municipal levels compiled and printed more than 800 kinds of folk song collections. The "Red Flag Ballads," compiled and selected by Guo Moruo and Zhou Yang, is a collection of masterpieces of new folk songs since the Great Leap Forward. The creation activities of compiling factory histories, commune histories, and troop histories have been widely carried out in the new form of collective creation by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1959, more than 100 factories and mines had published special editions and anthologies of factory histories in literary journals. In recent years, many excellent factory histories such as "Red Star of the North," "Red An Yuan," "Cradle of the Train," "Sparks of Steel City," and "Historical Account of the Construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel" have been published. In recent years, the outstanding novels, plays, essays, and poems that have emerged all contain works by amateur worker-peasant writers.

　　During this period, mass creation organizations have greatly developed. In Hubei Province, the number of amateur creation organizations has increased from 315 in 1953 to more than 10,000 now, and the number of creation group members has increased from 5,000 to more than 80,000. Among the large number of outstanding worker-peasant writers produced on the basis of the vigorous mass creation, there are the familiar worker writers and poets Hu Wanchun, Huang Shengxiao, Li Xue'ao, Wan Guoru, Wen Chengxun, Fei Liwen, A Feng, Tang Kexin, Fu Geng, etc., farmer writers and poets Wang Lao Jiu, Liu Yong, Li Maorong, Wang Anyou, Meng Sanbo. Duguer (Mongolian), etc., and soldier writers and poets Zhang Qin, Rao Jibasang (Tibetan), and so on.

　　The works of worker-peasant writers have strong characteristics of the era and a rich atmosphere of life, vividly reflecting the fighting spirit of industrial and agricultural production and shaping the distinct images of heroic figures. Hu Wanchun, a young worker writer in Shanghai, has published more than 80 novels, essays, and features since 1958, totaling more than 400,000 words, and has published two collections of short stories, "People with Special Character" and "Who are the Creators of Miracles." His first film script, "Iron and Steel Family," has been brought to the screen. Last year, the Writers Publishing House published farmer writer Li Maorong's 150,000-word literary work "People Hope for Happiness, Trees Hope for Spring," which sold more than 50,000 copies.

　　Many worker-peasant writers who have grown up under the cultivation and education of the Party love labor, care about the collective, and always place themselves among the masses. Farmer writer Liu Yong, who can carry more than 170 kilograms on one shoulder, created more than 100,000 words of novels and poems in 1959. In addition to frequently participating in various meetings, he also insisted on working more than 200 labor days, creating many poems in the fields. The dozen or so members of a rural amateur writing group he led have made rapid progress. Among them, the works of farmer poet Li Xiu'e were published last year by Hunan People's Publishing House in a collection of poems "Red Light Shines Everywhere."

　　Party committees in various places actively lead the mass creation movement, vigorously cultivate talented authors who have emerged from the worker-peasant masses, and help them improve their theoretical, ideological, and writing levels, and establish correct creative attitudes.

    工农作家队伍日益成长壮大
    热爱劳动，关心集体，始终置于群众之中
    作品具有强烈时代特色和浓厚的生活气息
    据新华社21日讯　在我国蓬勃发展的群众性创作运动中，一支雄伟的工农作家队伍日益成长壮大。
    近几年来，波澜壮阔的新民歌运动，风起云涌遍及全国各地，据民间文艺研究会不完全的统计，仅1958年，省市以上出版机构编印的民歌选集就有八百多种。由郭沫若、周扬编选的“红旗歌谣”集中了大跃进以来新民歌的杰作。编写工厂史、公社史、部队史的创作活动，以工农兵群众集体创作的新形式，广泛开展，据1959年底不完全的统计，已经有一百多个厂矿在文学期刊上发表了工厂史的特辑和文选，几年来已经出版了“北方的红星”、“红色的安源”、“列车的摇篮”、“钢城星火”、“武钢建设史话”等许多优秀的工厂史。近几年来出现的优秀小说、剧本、散文、诗歌中都有工农业余作家的作品。
    在这个时期，群众创作组织有了很大发展，湖北省的业余创作组织由1953年的三百一十五个发展到现在的一万多个，创作组员由五千人增加到八万多人。在蓬勃的群众创作基础上产生的大批优秀工农作家中，有读者熟悉的工人作家、诗人胡万春、黄声孝、李学鳌、万国儒、温承训、费礼文、阿风、唐克新、福庚等，有农民作家、诗人王老九、刘勇、李茂荣、王安友、孟三波·都古尔（蒙古族）等，还有战士作家、诗人张勤、饶吉巴桑（藏族）等等。
    工农作家的作品具有强烈的时代特色和浓厚的生活气息，生动地反映了工农业生产的斗争面貌，塑造了英雄人物的鲜明形象。上海青年工人作家胡万春，1958年以来共发表了小说、散文、特写八十多篇，约四十多万字，汇集出版了两个短篇小说集“特殊性格的人”和“谁是奇迹的创造者”。他所创作的第一个电影剧本“钢铁世家”，已经搬上了银幕。去年作家出版社出版了农民作家李茂荣十五万字的文学作品“人望幸福树望春”，销行五万多册。
    在党的培养教育下成长起来的许多工农作家，热爱劳动、关心集体，始终置身于群众之中。一肩能担一百七十多斤的农民作家刘勇，1959年创作了十多万字的小说和诗歌，他除了经常参加各种会议外，还坚持出工二百多个劳动日，在田边创作了不少诗歌。他所领导的一个农村业余创作组的十几位组员进步都很快，其中农民女诗人李秀娥的作品，去年已由湖南人民出版社出版了诗集“红光普照”。
    各地党委积极领导群众创作运动，对工农群众中涌现的有才能的作者，大力进行培养，帮助他们提高理论、思想、写作水平，树立正确的创作态度。
