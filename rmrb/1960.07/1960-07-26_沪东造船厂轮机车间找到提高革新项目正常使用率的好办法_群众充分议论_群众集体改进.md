This newspaper, Shanghai, July 25th: The leading cadres of the turbine workshop of Shanghai Hudong Shipyard fully promoted democracy when solving technical problems, deeply mobilized the masses in workshops and groups to express opinions and suggestions on technical innovation projects, so that the original unstable technical innovation projects were quickly and normally used in production, promoting the sustained leap forward in production.
　　In March and April this year, the workers of this workshop created a large number of mechanical equipment in three technical innovation upsurges, greatly improving the degree of mechanization. However, some equipment has not been used in production or is not used normally due to its own shortcomings and insufficient attention or support from the leadership. From mid-April, the workshop leaders began to focus on consolidation, promotion, and improvement, holding many large and small meetings, repeatedly calling on everyone to "vigorously grasp consolidation, promotion, and improvement work" and "treat new things with enthusiasm." After more than a month of this, only 68% of the 57 major innovation projects could be used for production, and some of them were not used normally. In order to find the crux of the problem, the secretary of the workshop's general party branch, the workshop director, and others went to the machine tools to solicit workers' opinions. The workers raised sharp criticisms of the "simply verbally calling" style of work. They immediately changed their approach, going deep into workshops and groups to seriously mobilize everyone to launch a major discussion and improvement on innovation projects. As a result, within three days, more than 95% of the major innovation projects were put into normal use.
　　During these three days, the workshop was full of discussions and enthusiasm. Workers held group meetings beside the machine tools to discuss whether each innovation project could be used, why it was not being used, what the shortcomings were, and what methods could be used to improve it. They fully exposed, analyzed, and researched various aspects, from different understandings of innovation projects, the shortcomings of the equipment itself, and operational problems. Not only did the workers discuss, but cadres and technicians also went to the original innovation groups to discuss with the workers. At the meetings, everyone expressed their opinions, disassembled the machine parts on the spot to check them one by one, find the causes, think of solutions, and immediately start improving them.
　　In this mass discussion, the workers' ideological understanding became more unified, and the technical problems became clearer. The mixed work section of the turbine general workshop had used indigenous methods to complete major innovations such as broaching machines and polygon milling machines. Originally, because the structure was not precise enough and the tool feed was not flexible enough, the processed parts were not smooth enough. Some workers, not used to using them, picked up their files and started working manually again. When the group started discussing this problem, some workers were still not confident that it could be improved, saying: "It's better to get a foreign machine tool, it's easier to use!" Other workers disagreed with this view, saying: "A newborn child can't run, it needs adults to take care of it." "Newly bought foreign machine tools often have problems, and they have to be repaired and adjusted before they can be used smoothly." They also cited the example of the native-made straw cutter they made in the past, which was not easy to use at first, but later was improved in the process of use and became very useful, contributing greatly to the completion of the production plan. After this discussion, everyone's understanding was unified, and they decided to improve it immediately. They disassembled the polygon milling machine and checked the parts one by one. If the fixture was not tight and the center was not correct, the technicians immediately drew drawings, and the workers found materials and made another fixture. After test runs, it still didn't work, so they looked for the problem again; later, they improved the automatic device, and the polygon milling machine started to work normally. At the same time, another group of workers also disassembled the broaching machine to check it, modifying it and testing it again and again. After four test runs, they finally made the broaching machine feed smoothly, easy to operate, and produce smooth teeth.
　　Through large-scale discussions and improvements, not only were the original innovation projects consolidated, but technical innovation achievements were also developed. Many originally semi-mechanized equipment have been developed into mechanized and semi-automated; some single innovations have been linked into assembly lines. Based on the mass discussions and improvements, four assembly lines have been further formed in the workshop. Bending pipes of various uses and shapes on ships is a complex and laborious task. During the technical innovation upsurge in March and April, the workers manufactured several native-made pipe bending machines, changing 95% of the pipes on ships from manual hot bending to machine cold bending. At the same time, sand filling machines were manufactured to replace manual sand filling, greatly changing the backward technical appearance of pipe bending work. In this discussion, Shen Yusheng, the vice-director of the workshop who was a worker, worked with the pipe bending workers to research and, with the assistance of relevant design departments, successfully tested a new pipe bending technology, further improving the efficiency and quality of pipe bending.
　　Through mass discussions, some problems in management and labor organization were also discovered. The workshop leaders made timely improvements. In June, the entire workshop fully completed the state plan three days ahead of schedule, and production increased by nearly 40% compared with May.

    沪东造船厂轮机车间找到提高革新项目正常使用率的好办法
    群众充分议论　群众集体改进
    本报上海25日电　上海沪东造船厂轮机车间领导干部在解决技术问题时充分发扬民主，深入工段、小组广泛发动群众对技术革新项目发议论，提建议，使原来不巩固的技术革新项目迅速地正常用于生产，促进了生产持续跃进。
    今年3、4月间，这个车间的职工在三次技术革新高潮中创制了大批机械设备，机械化程度大大提高。但是，有一部分设备由于本身还有缺点，领导方面重视或支持不够，以致尚未用于生产或用得不正常。4月中旬起，车间领导方面就开始抓巩固、推广、提高工作，大会小会开过好些次，数度号召大家“要大抓巩固、推广、提高工作”、“对待新生事物要热情”。这样抓了一个多月，五十七项重大革新项目能够用于生产的仍然仅占68％，其中有的使用得还不正常。为了找到问题的症结，车间党总支书记、车间主任等人到机床旁边征求工人意见。工人们对“光是口头上号召”的作风，提出了尖锐的批评。他们马上改变作法，分头深入工段、小组，认真发动大家对革新项目展开大议论，大改进。结果，三天之内，就使95％以上的重大革新项目正常使用起来。
    在这三天当中，车间里议论纷纷，热气腾腾。工人们纷纷在机床旁边开小组会，议论每个革新项目能不能用？为什么不用？缺点是什么？用什么办法改进？他们从对革新项目的不同认识、设备本身的缺点、操作问题等各个方面，充分进行暴露，分析，研究。不仅工人群众议论，而且干部和技术人员也下到原来搞革新的小组，和工人一起议论。会上各抒己见，当场把机器零件拆开来逐个检查，找原因，想办法，马上动手改进。
    在这一场群众性的大议论中，职工们的思想认识越议越统一，技术方面的问题越议越明确。轮机总工段混合分工段曾经用土办法完成了拉齿机、多边机等重大革新，原来由于结构不够精密，走刀不灵活，加工出的零件不够光滑，有的工人用不顺手，就又拿起锉刀用手工干起来。小组里开始议论这一问题的时候，有的工人对能不能改好仍然信心不足，说：“还是弄部洋机床来，用起来便当！”别的工人不同意这种看法，说：“刚生下来的小孩，总是不会跑路的，需要大人抚养。”“新买来的洋机床，也常出毛病，总得修修弄弄才能用得顺手。”他们还举出过去搞的土铡床的例子，开始也不好用，后来在使用过程中经过改进，就很好用了，对完成生产计划出了很大一把力。经过这番议论，大家的认识统一了，决定马上改进。他们把多边机拆开，检查一个个零件。夹具夹不紧，中心不对，技术人员马上画出图纸，工人找来材料，另外做了一副夹具。试车，还不行，便再找毛病；后来又改进了自动装置，多边机就正常使用起来了。与此同时，另一部分职工也把拉齿机拆开检查，改了试，试了改，先后经过四次试车，终于使拉齿机作到走刀灵活，操作方便，加工出的牙齿也光滑了。
    通过大议论，大改进，不仅巩固了原有的革新项目，而且发展了技术革新成果。不少原来是半机械化的设备，已经发展成机械化和半自动化的；有些单件的革新，已经联结成流水线。就在群众边议论边改进的基础上，车间里进一步组成了四条流水生产线。弯制船上各种用途各种形状的管子，是一项复杂而劳累的工作。在3、4月间的技术革新高潮中，职工们制造了几部土弯管机，使船上95％的管子由人工热弯改成了机器冷弯，同时制造成装砂机代替人工装砂，大大改变了弯管工作落后的技术面貌。在这次议论中，工人出身的车间副主任沈裕生，又和弯管工人一起研究，并且经过有关设计部门的协助，试验成功一种新的弯管技术，使弯管效率和质量又提高一步。
    通过群众大发议论，也发现了管理工作和劳动组织方面的一些问题。车间领导方面都及时作了改进。6月份，全车间提前三天全面完成了国家计划，生产比5月份增长了将近40％。
