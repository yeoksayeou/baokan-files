Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 2nd Dispatch: Following the conclusion of the preliminary talks in Melun between representatives of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and French representatives, Western news agencies and newspapers have continuously revealed the arrogant and unreasonable attitude adopted by the French side during the negotiations.

United Press International, in a dispatch from Paris yesterday, quoted well-informed sources in Paris as saying that the French government rejected the Algerian side's demand to have the same status as French officials in the talks. It said "no" to all the demands put forward by the Algerian side. The report stated that France did not agree to a direct meeting between Abbas and de Gaulle on an equal footing, and did not agree to the Algerian delegation freely holding press conferences and contacting Algerian government Vice Premier Ben Bella and others who had been kidnapped in France during the negotiations.

UPI also reported: Algerian sources said, "We (Algeria) are unwilling to go to Paris based on unilaterally determined conditions. The French government representatives in Melun told us, 'These are our conditions, either accept them or reject them'." This person also said that accepting these conditions would be like accepting unconditional surrender. At the same time, some French bourgeois newspapers clamored that a ceasefire by the Algerian National Liberation Army was a prerequisite for holding negotiations. "L'Aurore" said that de Gaulle has repeatedly stated that "a ceasefire must precede any negotiations."

"Paris Jour" wrote, "Talks (between Abbas and de Gaulle) will only take place when the fighting truly stops."

Boumendjel, the Algerian government representative who came to France to hold preliminary talks with the French authorities, left France by plane on the 1st to return to the provisional government's headquarters in Tunis. According to Agence France-Presse, Boumendjel spoke to reporters on the plane. The news said that Boumendjel expressed his unhappiness with the Melun talks. When asked by reporters if he would return to Paris for further talks, Boumendjel replied, "In any case, I will not go to Paris under the current conditions."

    西方通讯社和报纸透露默伦会谈情况
    法国殖民者态度蛮横无理
    竟不承认阿尔及利亚在谈判中的平等地位
    新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表同法国代表在默伦举行的预备会谈结束之后，西方通讯社和报纸不断透露出法方在谈判中采取的蛮横无理的态度。
    合众国际社昨天从巴黎发出的消息引用巴黎消息灵通人士的话说，法国政府拒绝了阿尔及利亚方面提出的在会谈中要有同法国官员同等身份的要求。它对阿尔及利亚方面提出的一切要求都说
  “不”。消息说，法国不同意阿巴斯和戴高乐以平等地位直接会谈，不同意阿尔及利亚代表团在谈判期间自由举行记者招待会和同被绑架在法国的阿尔及利亚政府副总理本·贝拉等人接触。
    合众国际社还报道：阿尔及利亚方面人士曾说，“我们（阿尔及利亚）不愿意根据单方面确定的条件到巴黎去。法国政府代表在默伦对我们说，‘这些是我们的条件，要么接受这些条件，要么就拒绝它们’”。这个人士还说，如果接受了这些条件，那就好像接受了无条件投降。与此同时，一些法国资产阶级报纸也叫嚷阿尔及利亚民族解放军停止战斗是举行谈判的先决条件。“震旦报”说，戴高乐一再说过，“进行各种谈判前必须停火”。
    “今日巴黎”写道，“只有当战斗真正停止时，才会有（阿巴斯同戴高乐的）会谈”。
    前来法国同法国当局举行预备会谈的阿尔及利亚政府代表布曼杰尔1日乘飞机离开法国回到临时政府所在地突尼斯去。据法新社报道，布曼杰尔在飞机上同记者们进行了谈话。这条消息说，布曼杰尔对默伦会谈表示很不愉快。在记者问他是否回到巴黎作进一步会谈时，布曼杰尔答复说，“无论如何，决不在目前这些条件下到巴黎去”。
