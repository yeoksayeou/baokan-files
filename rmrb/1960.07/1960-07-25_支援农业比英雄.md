	Supporting Agriculture: A Heroic Undertaking
	Zhang Rui, Secretary of the Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory Party Committee
	"Workers and peasants are brothers, supporting agriculture is a heroic undertaking. Seize every minute to manufacture farm tools, everything for a bumper harvest."
	These few sentences precisely express the lofty aspirations of all the workers in our factory in actively responding to the magnificent call to vigorously support agriculture. "Everything is for supporting agriculture, people will go when needed, equipment will be repaired as soon as it arrives, and everyone should do at least one good deed for the countryside." This is the noble ambition of all the workers. Sixth-grade technician Master Zhang Tai'an led three young people to Qijiawan to support drought resistance. The commune assigned them to be responsible for the repair of water pumps and diesel engines at the pumping station. They stayed by the telephone day and night, and would set off immediately as soon as they received a call. Once, they received a call at night and rushed to Tazigang Township, sixty miles away, overnight to repair the water pump for them. Once, they assembled a new diesel engine in Victory Township, but because of the lack of parts, which could not be matched in the countryside, they rushed back to the factory to get the parts and then rushed back to install them, until the test run was normal and they taught the farmer brothers how to master the operating technology, before they left there. The third time they accepted the installation of a ninety-horsepower gas engine. Because the body was too large, the countryside lacked transportation tools, and the road was difficult to travel, it could not be transported to the installation site. They used their brains to think of a solution, disassembled all the parts that could be carried by four people, and finally mobilized commune cadres and farmers to carry the gas engine to the installation site together with them, and quickly installed it. This deeply moved the commune cadres and farmers, who all said: "The comrades from the factory support us so selflessly, we can only learn from them and work hard to increase production to repay them."
	The farmers were so moved, and the workers were further educated and enlightened, realizing the great significance of helping agriculture to achieve mechanization. Therefore, the whole factory was full of the spirit that as long as it was a matter of supporting agriculture, everyone would rush to do it, and even if they did not understand the work, they would gather around and contribute their strength. After the Central Mobile Harvesting Team arrived in Huangpi, the factory immediately organized senior technicians to go to support them with tools and accessories. When the workers who went to support arrived in the county, they heard that the generators of five harvesters were broken and urgently needed to be put into the field, and they had to be repaired immediately. However, there was only one electrician among the workers who went to support, and it was impossible to quickly repair these five motors. However, a harvester can harvest 200 catties of wheat in four minutes. If the repair is delayed by one day, each harvester will harvest 72,000 catties of wheat less. Under such circumstances, how could the comrades who went with him watch an electrician repair it slowly! Mechanical technician Zhao Huanpeng and fitter Liu Wensheng showed their daring spirit and rushed to repair the five motors together with the electrician. Without removing their armor and without stopping, they rushed to the location of the harvester overnight and started working. If they didn't understand, the electrician would first demonstrate, and the other workers would learn and do it at the same time. An electrician took four novices and repaired the five motors in one day and one night. Although they were a little tired, they felt extremely relaxed when they saw the repaired harvesters harvesting large-eared and plump wheat back and forth in the golden wheat sea.
	Technical assistance to the countryside is not only to help repair machines, but also to vigorously train technicians. Red Banner Pacesetter Fan Zhongzhi said it well: "To help agriculture achieve mechanization, it is not enough to send a few machine tools and help repair them when they are broken. We must teach them to master the machines, just like us, so that they can be the masters of the machines." Therefore, he only spent more than seven months to train a skilled technician for agriculture. In February of this year, Fan Zhongzhi followed the factory's agricultural visiting group to the county farm tool factory and worked with his apprentice Wu Hengfen to improve the tools. The workers of this farm were very moved and wrote such a big-character poster: "Jiang'an Factory old brothers, sent representatives to deliver treasures, delivering treasures to the door is great, solving key problems is effective. The machine drills holes well and quickly, and can do half a month's work in one day. The tools are improved to be flexible and clever, and the efficiency is increased by more than two times. We have nothing else to say, quickly make farm tools and grow more grain, move two mountains of gold and silver, and dedicate them to the industrial old brothers."
	Before the commune's wheat harvest, the provincial party committee designated our factory to rush to manufacture 200 threshing machines to support agriculture. This task was quickly spread to every corner of the factory. All the workers in the factory went all out and fought day and night, thus winning time and completing the task.
	In the battle to build threshing machines in a big way, as soon as the forging team of Jiang Guoqing accepted the task, they encountered a roadblock: no materials. They couldn't start work no matter how anxious they were. Jiang Guoqing didn't sleep well all night because of this. Assistant Gao Wenshao was as anxious as his master and couldn't lie down. He went to the factory at night to find waste materials, but after being put into production, the quality was poor, the output was low, and the supply could not keep up with processing. They immediately held a Zhuge Liang meeting to study the die and created the miracle of completing three days of tasks in one day. As a result, in the rush to manufacture threshing machines, Jiang Guoqing and Gao Wenshao made eight innovations, including changing the forging of wrenches from manual to die forging, from more than 30 pieces per day to more than 310 pieces. However, the lathe masters were not to be outdone, and they launched a climax of clever work of "thinking of innovation is as vast as the sea and the sky, and making revolution is earth-shattering." When lathe operator He Wenbin added a counterweight wheel to the slotting machine, he could only do two pieces a day. He said: "If this continues, it will be like a child eating steamed buns, nibbling little by little. When will 200 threshing machines be finished? If we miss the season and affect the wheat harvest, wouldn't it be a big problem if it is soaked in rain?" Therefore, he used his brains and installed a fixed frame on the tool holder, increasing efficiency seven times. Old worker Han Changlai thought day and night and made a crankshaft template, which increased the crankshaft processing efficiency by five times. While they were making innovations in a big way, they also launched a competition production sports meeting in full swing, and the results of the competition were announced every day. The momentum of you chasing me and wave after wave pushing made the processing progress of the threshing machine parts rise in a straight line. Lathe operator Guo Huali and Zhu Shilin launched a competition against each other. These two young men were evenly matched in the crankshaft processing competition and both completed three pieces. The next day, the tools were improved, and Guo Huali defeated his opponent with an advantage of nine to eight. On the third day, Guo Huali still took the lead with a score of eighteen to sixteen. The two people were both opponents and friends, and they exchanged experiences together after work every day. On the fourth day, the competition also carried out technological reforms, and one car could be picked at a time. As a result, Guo Huali still led with twenty-eight to twenty-seven. Zhu Shilin thought to himself: Developing agriculture is the foundation, and building threshing machines in a big way must seize the season. Only by building them early can we ensure that the wheat is harvested and avoid losses caused by wind and rain. Sure enough, on the fifth day of the competition, Zhu Shilin broke Guo Huali's record of 28 pieces per day with a production of 32 pieces per day.
	After the competition, when asked where they got this energy, they said: "Everything is inseparable from grain. Rushing to build threshing machines is to protect grain and grab grain. How can we not go all out?" It was this motivation that the accessories forged by the forgers were piled up like mountains beside the lathe. The lathe operators quickly moved this small mountain down. This made He Bin, the branch secretary of the workshop in charge of assembly, anxious. All the accessories were complete, but the mortise opening process of the carpenter became the key, which affected the assembly. The concentration of superior forces did not take this level, and He Bin was so anxious that he couldn't sit still, so he took the drill and went to do it himself. In this way, he discovered a problem: if the mortise opening is done according to the old method, let alone working more than ten hours a day, it would be useless to fight day and night. The idea of jumping out of the old circle of manual mortise opening came to his mind repeatedly. Finally, he and the worker Xiao Yonghou created a mortise opening machine, which increased efficiency by more than four times. This finally cured his anxiety. After the production caught up, he said: "It is a great thing to support agriculture, and I feel comfortable from the bottom of my heart."

专栏：党委书记手记

    支援农业比英雄
    中共武汉江岸车辆工厂委员会书记　张锐
    “工人农民是兄弟，支援农业比英雄，分秒必争造农具，一切为了大丰收。”
    这几句话正是表达我厂全体职工积极响应大力支援农业的雄伟号召。“一切为了支援农业，要人就走，设备随到随修，每人至少要为农村做一件好事。”这是全体职工的崇高志向。六级技工张太端师傅，带领三个青年去七家湾支援抗旱，社里派他们在抽水机站负责抽水机、柴油机的修理工作。他们日夜守在电话机旁，只要一有电话就马上动身。有一次夜间接到电话，一夜跑到六十里外的塔子岗乡，为他们修复了抽水机。有一次在胜利乡组装一台新柴油机，因为缺少零件，在农村又配不上，他们就赶回工厂配齐零件再赶回去安装，直到试车正常，教会农民兄弟掌握操作技术，才离开那里。第三次接受了安装九十马力的煤气机，因为机身太大，农村又缺乏运输工具，道路又不好走，运不到安装地点。他们就动脑筋想办法，把能够用四个人抬的零件全部拆下来，最后动员社干部和农民同他们一起把煤气机抬到安装地点，很快就安装起来。这事深深感动了社干部和农民，大家都说：“工厂同志这样无私的支援我们，我们只有好好向他们学习，努力增加生产来报答。”
    农民这样感动，工人也进一步得到了教育和启发，体会到帮助农业实现机械化的重大意义。因而全厂出现了只要一听说是支援农业的事情，就都抢着干，那怕是自己不懂的工作，也要围拢上去，贡献自己的力量。在中央流动收割队来到黄陂以后，工厂马上就组织了高级技工，带着工具和配件前往支援。当支援的工人到县以后，听说有五部收割机的发电机坏了，急等下地，须立即修理，可是前往支援的工人只有一个电工，要很快修好这五部电机是不可能的。然而，一部收割机，四分钟内就可收麦二百斤，如果晚修一天，每部收割机要少收七万二千斤小麦。在这种情况下，一同去的同志，怎能看着一个电工去慢慢的修啊！机械技术员赵焕彭和钳工刘文生拿出了敢想敢干的劲头，和电工一起抢修这五部电机。他们兵不卸甲，马不停蹄地连夜赶到了收割机的所在地，动手就干了起来。不懂怎么办，一个电工先作示范，其他的工人边学边干，一个电工带着四个生手，一天一夜把五部电机修好了。虽然有点累，可是看到修好的收割机在金黄色的麦海里来回地收割着穗大粒肥的小麦，身上感到轻松极了。
    技术下乡不单是帮助修理机器，还要大力培训技工。红旗手范忠志说得好：“帮助农业实现机械化，送几部机床，坏了帮助修，那是不够的，必须教会他们掌握机械，像我们一样能当机器的主人。”因此，他只用了七个多月的时间，就为农业培养了一个熟练的技工。范忠志在今年2月份，随工厂农业访问团到县农具厂和他的徒弟吴恒芬一起改进了工具。这个农场的职工很受感动，写了这样一张大字报：“江岸工厂老大哥，派出代表来送宝，送宝上门呱呱叫，解决关键效果好。机器打眼好又快，一天能干半月活，工具改得灵又巧，效率提高两倍多，我们没有别的说，快造农具多打粮，搬上金银两座山，献给工业老大哥。”
    在公社麦收之前，省委指定我厂赶制二百台脱谷机的支援农业任务，很快的传到了工厂的每一个角落。全厂职工无不全力以赴，日夜奋战，因而赢得了时间，完成了任务。
    在大造脱谷机的战斗中，锻工江国清组刚接受任务，就遇到了拦路虎，没材料，千急万急也开不了工。因为这件事江国清一夜也没睡好。助手高文少也和师傅一样，心急如火躺不下，夜晚进厂找废料，可是投入生产后又出现了质量差，产量低，供不上加工的情况。他们马上又召开了诸葛亮会，研究了胎模，创造了三天任务一天完成的奇迹。结果在赶制脱谷机中，江国清和高文少两人就提了八项革新，其中锻造搬手，由手工改成压锻，由日产三十多把，提高到三百一十多把。可是车工师傅也不示弱，他们掀起了“想革新海阔天空，闹革命翻天复地”的巧干高潮。车工贺文彬在插床上加中元轮时，一天只能干两个，他说：“这样下去，像小孩吃馍馍，一点一点啃，二百台脱谷机几时干完，误了季节影响麦收，如果被一场雨泡起来，那不成了大问题？”因此，他就动起了脑筋，在随刀架上搞了一个固定架，提高工效七倍。老工人韩昌来，日思夜想，搞了一个曲轴靠模，使曲轴加工提高工效五倍。他们在大闹革新的同时，还如火如荼地开展了竞赛生产运动会，比赛结果一天一公布。你追我赶浪浪急推的劲头，使脱谷机的配件加工进度直线上升。车工郭华利与朱时霖开展了一场对手赛。这两个小伙子在加工曲轴的比赛中，是不分上下的，都完成了三根。第二天刀具都进行了改进，郭华利以九比八的优势战胜了对手。第三天郭华利又以十八比十六的成绩仍占鳌头。两个人又是对手又是朋友，每天收工后都在一起交流经验，第四天比赛又进行了工艺改革，一次正车就可挑成，结果郭华利又以二十八比二十七根仍然领先。朱时霖心想：发展农业是基础，大造脱谷机必须抢季节，早日造成才能保证小麦颗粒归仓，免受风雨造成损失。果然，比赛到第五天，朱时霖就以日产三十二根的成绩刷新了郭华利日产二十八根的纪录。
    竞赛以后，问他们哪来的这股劲，他们说：“干什么都离不了粮食，赶造脱谷机就是保粮抢粮，我们能不全力以赴嘛。”就是这个动力，车床边被锻工打成的配件堆成了山。车工又把这座小山很快的搬倒了。这下可把担任组装工作的车间支部书记何斌给急坏了，配件都齐了，可木工开榫这道工序成了关键，影响组装，集中优势兵力也没拿下这一关，急得何斌坐立不安，自己就拿着钻头亲自去干。这样，他发现一个问题，如果开榫按照老一套，别说一天干十几小时，就是日夜不下火线也白搭。一个跳出手工开榫老圈套的想法，就在他的脑袋里翻来复去的想开了。终于他和工人萧永厚一起创造了开榫机，提高工效四倍多。这一下他坐立不安的心病才算治好了。等生产赶上去以后他说：“为支援农业做了一件大好事，从心眼里感到舒服。”
