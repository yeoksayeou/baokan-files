Editorial Afterword:

　　Everyone Get Moving to Eliminate Mosquitoes and Flies
　　The Shanghai blitz to encircle and annihilate mosquitoes and flies comes at just the right time!
　　Currently, the weather is hot, which is precisely when mosquitoes and flies are rampant. A single female fly can lay eggs every six to eight days, each time laying around one hundred and fifty eggs. The number of eggs laid by a female mosquito is even more astonishing, reaching two to three hundred at a time. Therefore, eliminating one mosquito or fly is equivalent to eliminating hundreds, even thousands!
　　Currently, it is also a busy season for production. If a large number of mosquitoes and flies are allowed to breed, it will inevitably affect people's sleep and health, and affect production. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize people from all walks of life to launch several blitz campaigns to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds.
　　However, blitzes must be combined with regular work. If there are only blitzes without regular work, the results of the blitzes cannot be consolidated. Therefore, we advocate that everyone, whether old, young, youth, adults, teachers, students, men, or women, should hold a fly swatter in their hands, and hit mosquitoes and flies whenever they see them, encircling and annihilating mosquitoes and flies!

    人人动手消灭蚊蝇
    上海围歼蚊蝇突击之战，来得适时！
    目前，天气炎热，正是蚊蝇猖獗之时。一个雌蝇，六至八天即可产卵一次，每次都在一百五十粒左右。雌蚊的产卵数目，更为惊人，一次可达二、三百个。因此，消灭一个蚊蝇，就等于消灭数百个，数千个！
    目前，又是生产繁忙季节。如果让大量的蚊蝇产生，势必影响人们的睡眠和身体健康，影响生产。因此，有必要动员各界人民，来它几次突击运动，消灭蚊蝇孳生地。
    但是，突击必须和经常相结合。只有突击，没有经常，突击的成果就不能巩固。因此，我们提倡无论老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教员、学生、男子、女子，人人手执蝇拍，见蚊蝇就打，围歼蚊蝇！
