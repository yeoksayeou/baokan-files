　　Introducing China's Fine Breed of Dairy Cattle – Sanhe Cattle
　　By our reporter Bai Shulian

　　How many admiring eyes converge upon you,
　　All who know you raise their fingers to applaud,
　　On the podium of animal husbandry science, your name is already on the honor roll,
　　Sanhe cattle, anonymous and hidden for decades,
　　Today you are famous throughout the world, your voice shakes the four directions!

　　This is a song popular among the workers of state-owned farms and ranches on the Hulunbuir grassland in Inner Mongolia. From this song, it is not difficult for people to know how likable the Sanhe cattle are!

　　The First Domestic Dairy Cattle Breed

　　Just a few years ago, Sanhe cattle were still ordinary cattle on the grasslands, but today they have entered the ranks of the world's fine dairy cattle breeds as China's domestic fine breed. In the textbooks of various agricultural and animal husbandry colleges and animal husbandry and veterinary schools in China that introduce China's dairy cattle breeds, it occupies a primary position.

　　The composition of an excellent livestock breed should have many conditions: suitable for the needs of the national economy, strong heritability, high production performance, and able to adapt to the environment; in addition, it also requires consistent body conformation and a certain number to ensure self-group breeding.

　　Does China have a dairy cattle breed that meets these conditions? This was a question that many people had not been able to figure out seven years ago, especially before liberation. In order to find such an ideal dairy cattle breed, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted arduous dairy cattle breed surveys in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang from June 1954 to 1955, and finally discovered such a breed, which is the Sanhe cattle of Inner Mongolia. According to comrades from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, eight excellent dairy cattle breeds, including Sanhe cattle, have been discovered in the country. Among these breeds, Sanhe cattle are second to none in terms of quantity and quality. Therefore, at the National Livestock and Poultry Breeding Work Conference held in Beijing last year, the Central Ministry of Agriculture officially identified Sanhe cattle as China's domestic fine dairy cattle breed and decided to vigorously develop it throughout the country.

　　Cultivated by the Hard Work of the Laboring People

　　On a fine early summer day, we made a pilgrimage to the state-owned Xiertala Stud Farm, more than seventy miles away from the border city of Hailar. This is one of the thirty-odd farms and ranches in the Hulunbuir grassland that mainly cultivate Sanhe cattle and Sanhe horses, with five branch farms, each of which raises hundreds of Sanhe cattle, with a total of more than two thousand three hundred heads. The cattle sheds of the Xiertala Branch Farm are built to the east of the farm headquarters. As soon as we entered the cattle shed, we were immediately attracted by the majestic appearance of the Sanhe cattle. The dairy cattle with yellow-red color dotted with white flowers, about four and a half feet high and more than five feet long, had a chest circumference of eight feet, and the udders drooped heavily, like a large wine vat. According to the comrades of the farm, due to careful feeding and management, its average milk yield is more than 20 kilograms per head per day, and the average milk fat rate reaches 4.1%. On the vast pasture, the farm's breeding bulls were regularly pulling sleds for exercise. These Sanhe breeding bulls were all fat and strong. The comrades of the farm pointed to one of them and told us: This is breeding bull No. 037, weighing one thousand and seventy kilograms, more than two hundred kilograms heavier than ordinary Dutch breeding bulls and Shorthorn breeding bulls. We walked into the maternity ward and happened to meet several calving attendants weighing a wet, newborn calf. "Thirty-eight and a half kilograms," the weigher told the recorder. "So big at birth?" A comrade who was visiting with us said in surprise. "Is that big? There are also those that weigh more than fifty kilograms at birth," the calving attendants added.

　　Several experts from the farm who study Sanhe cattle enthusiastically introduced us to the history of Sanhe cattle. Sanhe cattle, currently numbering more than 100,000 heads in the country, with more than 70,000 heads distributed in the Gen River, Delebu'er River, Habule River basin, and along the Binzhou Railway in Ergun Banner, Hulunbuir League, are therefore called "Sanhe cattle." The fine breed of Sanhe cattle is the result of the hard work of the industrious Mongolian and Han people of our country for more than sixty years, mainly the convergence and crystallization of the various advantages and characteristics of Mongolian cattle and Soviet Simmental cattle. As early as 1898 to 1905, when Tsarist Russia built the Chinese Eastern Railway, it imported a batch of Siberian improved cattle (hybrids of Simmental cattle and Siberian local cattle) and purebred Simmental cattle from Siberia to improve the local Mongolian cattle. After Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, it also introduced a small number of Dutch cattle for improvement. Therefore, Sanhe cattle also have some blood relationship with Dutch cattle.

　　The Hulunbuir grassland has crisscrossing rivers, fertile soil, and abundant high-quality pasture, which is very suitable for grazing. However, the climate here is extremely cold, with temperatures below zero for seven months of the year, a maximum temperature of thirty-five degrees, and a minimum of minus fifty degrees. The temperature difference is huge and changes are unpredictable. This natural environment has had a great impact on the formation of the Sanhe cattle, which is a breed that is both cold-resistant and heat-resistant, and highly adaptable.

　　In the long days before liberation, the Mongolian and Han working people who lived in the Hulunbuir grassland were hired by exiled Tsarist Russian nobles to serve Japanese imperialists. Although they grazed cattle and cultivated and improved dairy cattle year after year, the fine breeds were not well propagated. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups, who became masters of the country, actively developed fine breeds of livestock on the grasslands under the guidance of the Party's policy of high-speed development of animal husbandry, especially from 1954. The state vigorously purchased Sanhe cattle and horses scattered among the people, and established herds of Sanhe cattle and horse farms on the Hulunbuir grassland. At the same time, a series of tasks such as quarantine, treatment, and rectification of livestock herds were carried out on Sanhe cattle, so that the quantity and quality of Sanhe cattle have been rapidly developed and improved.

　　"Treasure" is Produced in Our Motherland

　　In the past, some dairy cattle breeders in our country regarded Dutch cattle and British Shorthorn cattle as treasures. In fact, these people were blinded by the idea of valuing foreign things and neglecting domestic ones, and did not see that the real "treasure" was in our own country.

　　Comrades from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Hulunbuir League State-owned Farm and Ranch Administration Bureau told me that although the milk yield of Dutch cattle and Shorthorn cattle at the Daheihe Dairy Farm in Hohhot is higher, the milk fat rate is low, only 3.6% and 3.8%. At the same time, they are delicate and prone to disease, and have poor cold and heat resistance. Because Sanhe cattle grow in the cold Hulunbuir grassland, they are cold-resistant, can withstand coarse feed, are less prone to disease, and are easy to raise. At the same time, they can also adapt to the hot south. Regardless of cold or tropical regions, as long as feeding management can be improved, they can show their skills and show high production performance. The Sanhe cattle raised by the people's communes in the Hulunbuir League pastoral areas mainly rely on natural grazing all year round. Due to the overly extensive feeding management, the potential cannot be fully utilized, and the average milk production in a lactation period is only 1,700 to 2,000 kilograms. The Sanhe cattle in the state-owned farms and ranches are grazed in summer and housed in autumn, winter, and spring, and supplemented with silage and concentrate feed. The average milk production in a lactation period is increased to 2,600 to 3,000 kilograms, and some are as high as 5,600 kilograms. In Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places, feeding management is more scientific, feed is diversified, and supply is timely. Especially in the south, it is evergreen all year round, and green grass can be eaten throughout the year. Therefore, the milk production of Sanhe cattle living in these places has been greatly improved. According to comrades from the Inner Mongolia State-owned Farm and Ranch Administration Bureau, the average milk yield of Sanhe cattle introduced from Hulunbuir League to the Shuangqiao Farm in Beijing is 4,795 kilograms in a lactation period, and the highest is 7,400 kilograms.

　　Reproducing More Sanhe Cattle

　　Before 1957, most provinces outside the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region did not know much about Sanhe cattle. At that time, only Guangdong Province and Wuhan City imported 73 heads from Hulunbuir League. Now, people from all over the country come to Inner Mongolia to purchase and transport Sanhe cattle, and they are often overwhelmed, and letters and official letters are constantly flying in. According to statistics, among the twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the country, twenty-four provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have promoted Sanhe cattle. Now, people can see Sanhe cattle from the Hulunbuir grassland breeding and developing there in Heilongjiang in the north, Yunnan and Guizhou in the south, and large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, as well as certain rural people's communes. This spring, at the International Agricultural Exposition held in India, Sanhe cattle attracted international audiences with their unique beauty. Isn't all this the glory of the people of all ethnic groups on the Hulunbuir grassland fighting on the animal husbandry front and the reputation of Sanhe cattle?

　　The state-owned farms and ranches and people's communes in the Hulunbuir League, which are responsible for supplying Sanhe cattle to the whole country, now feel that their responsibilities are even greater. This year, they have set themselves a new combat mission: to rapidly develop the base of Sanhe cattle, continue to increase the quantity, improve the quality, and further meet the needs of national economic construction. At present, with the support of all parties, they are continuing to build and expand many mechanized production farms and ranches, and are actively carrying out the breeding of Sanhe cattle, sorting out the three major types of Sanhe cattle: red (yellow) and white flowers, black and white flowers, and gray and white flowers, selecting the best and eliminating the inferior, and respectively cultivating them into dairy types and dairy-meat dual-purpose types. It can be expected that in a few years, there will be more Sanhe cattle from the Hulunbuir grassland, with a larger quantity than now and a higher quality than now, continuously transported to all parts of the country.

　　介绍我国良种乳牛——三河牛
　　本报记者　白树廉
    多少只羡慕的眼光，会聚在你的身上，
    凡是认识的都伸出指头，为你鼓掌，
    畜牧科学的讲坛上，已经贴出你的红榜，
    匿名隐姓几十年的三河牛哟，
    你今天扬名天下，声震四方！
    这是流行在内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上国营农牧场职工中的一首赞歌。从这支歌子里，人们不难知道三河牛是多么讨人喜欢的好品种啊！
    第一个国产乳牛良种
    在几年前，三河牛还是草原上普通的牛，而今天却以我国国产良种的资格，走进世界良种乳牛的行列。在我国各高中等农牧院校和畜牧兽医学校介绍我国乳牛品种的教材中，它又占居了首要地位。
    一个优良牲畜品种的构成，应具备许多条件：适合国民经济的需要，遗传力强，生产性能高，能适应环境；此外还要求体质外貌一致和有一定数量，保证自群繁育。
    我国是否有具备这样一些条件的乳牛品种呢？这是七年前，特别是解放以前好多人始终未弄清楚的一个问题。华北农业科学研究所，为了找到这样一个理想的乳牛品种，曾在1954年6月到1955年间，在内蒙古和黑龙江地区，进行了艰苦的乳牛品种调查工作，并且终于发现了这样的品种，这就是内蒙古的三河牛。据中央农业部畜牧兽医总局的同志说，目前全国已经发现包括三河牛在内有八个优良乳牛品种。在这些品种中，不论从数量或质量上看，三河牛都首屈一指。因此，去年在北京举行的全国家畜家禽育种工作会议上，中央农业部正式确定三河牛为我国国产优良乳牛品种，并决定在全国大力发展。
  是劳动人民辛勤培养的
    在一个初夏的大好天气里，我们到距离边疆城市海拉尔七十多里的国营谢尔塔拉种牛场作了一次巡礼。这是呼伦贝尔草原上三十多个以培育三河牛、三河马为主的农牧场之一，共有五个分场，每个分场都饲养着几百头三河牛，全场共有二千三百多头。谢尔塔拉分场的牛舍建筑在场部东边，我们一走进牛舍便立即被三河牛的雄姿吸引住了。那毛色黄红点缀着白花的乳牛，高约四尺半，体长五尺多，胸围足有八尺，乳房沉甸甸地垂着，像个大酒篓。据牧场同志说，由于精心饲养管理，它的平均奶产量每头每天在二十公斤以上，平均乳脂率达4.1％。在广阔的草场上，牧场的种公牛这一天照例地拉着爬犁在运动着。这些三河种公牛，个个膘肥体壮，牧场同志指着其中一头告诉我们：这是037号种牛，体重一千零七十公斤，比一般荷兰种公牛和短角种公牛重二百多公斤。我们走进产房，巧碰上几个接产员在为一头湿漉漉的初生牛犊过磅。“三十八点五公斤”，司磅的告诉记录员。“一生下就这么大？”一道参观的一个同志惊讶地说。“这还算大？还有一生下来就有五十多公斤的呢。”接产员们这样补充了一句。
    牧场几位研究三河牛的专家，热情地向我们介绍了三河牛的历史。三河牛，目前在全国约有十万多头，其中七万多头分布在呼伦贝尔盟境内额尔古纳旗的根河、得勒布尔河、哈布勒河流域和滨州铁路沿线一带，因此就称为“三河牛”。优良品种三河牛，是我国勤劳的蒙汉族人民六十多年辛勤劳动的成果，主要是蒙古牛和苏联西门答尔牛的各种优点和特点的汇合与结晶。远在1898到1905年，帝俄修建中东铁路时，由西伯利亚一带输入一批西伯利亚改良牛（西门答尔牛和西伯利亚本地牛的杂种）和纯种西门答尔牛来改良当地蒙古牛。日本帝国主义侵占我国东北后，又引入少数荷兰牛进行改良，因此，三河牛同荷兰牛还有一点血缘关系。
    呼伦贝尔草原上，河流纵横，土质肥沃，又生长着繁茂的优良牧草，很适宜放牧。但是，这里气候异常寒冷，全年气温有七个月都在零度以下，最高温度为三十五度，最低为零下五十度，温差悬殊，变化无常，这种自然环境，对于形成三河牛这个既耐寒又耐热，适应性很强的品种，起了很大影响。
    解放以前漫长的日子里，世居呼伦贝尔草原上的蒙、汉族劳动人民，被流亡我国的帝俄贵族雇佣为日本帝国主义者服役，虽然长年累月地放牧牛群，培育改良乳牛，但优良品种一直未很好繁殖起来。解放以后，作了国家主人的各族人民，在党的高速度发展畜牧业方针指导下，积极发展草原上的良种牲畜，特别是从1954年开始，国家大力收购分散在民间的三河牛、马，在呼伦贝尔草原上，建立起成群的三河牛、马饲养场。同时对三河牛进行了检疫、治疗及整顿畜群等一系列工作，从而使三河牛的数量和质量得到了迅速的发展和提高。
    “宝贝”出在我们祖国
    我国过去的一些乳牛饲养业者，把荷兰牛、英国短角牛视如珍宝。实际是这些人让重洋轻土思想迷住了眼睛，没有看到真正的“宝贝”就在我们自己的国家里。
    内蒙古自治区和呼伦贝尔盟国营农牧场管理局的同志们告诉我：呼和浩特大黑河乳牛场的荷兰牛、短角牛奶产量虽然较高，但乳脂率低，只有3.6％和3.8％，同时娇嫩多病，抗寒、耐热能力都很差。而三河牛由于生长在严寒的呼伦贝尔草原，所以能抗寒，耐粗饲，少得病，容易饲养。同时，在炎热的南方也能适应。不管寒带热带，只要能改善饲养管理，它就能在那里大显身手，表现出很高的生产性能。呼伦贝尔盟牧区人民公社饲养的三河牛，一年四季主要依靠自然放牧，由于饲养管理过于粗放，潜力不能充分发挥，在一个泌乳期平均只产乳一千七百到二千公斤。而各国营农牧场的三河牛，夏季放牧，秋冬春季舍饲，并贴喂青贮和精料，一个泌乳期平均产乳量就提高到二千六百到三千公斤，有的高达五千六百公斤。北京、广州、武汉等地，饲养管理更加科学了，饲料多样化，供应及时，特别是在南方，四季常青，全年可吃到青草，因而生活在这些地方的三河牛奶产量有更大的提高。据内蒙古国营农牧场管理局的同志说，由呼伦贝尔盟引入北京双桥农场的三河牛，一个泌乳期的平均奶产量是四千七百九十五公斤，最高的是七千四百公斤。繁殖更多的
  三河牛
    1957年以前，内蒙古自治区以外的各省，对三河牛多不了解，那时只有广东省和武汉市从呼伦贝尔盟输入七十三头。现在从祖国各地到内蒙古购买接运三河牛的人们，经常应接不暇，信件公函，不断飞来。据统计，全国二十八个省、市、自治区中，有二十四个省、市、自治区都推广了三河牛。现在，人们随便到祖国北方的黑龙江或南方的云南、贵州或北京、上海等大城市，以及某些农村公社，都可以看到呼伦贝尔草原上的三河牛在那里繁殖发展。今年春天，在印度举行的国际农业博览会上，三河牛以其独居的健美，吸引了国际观众。这一切不都是奋战在畜牧业战线上的呼伦贝尔草原上各族人民的光荣和三河牛的声誉吗。
    担负着供应全国三河牛主要任务的呼伦贝尔盟各国营农牧场和各人民公社，现在更感到自己的责任重大了。他们今年给自己提出了：把三河牛的基地迅速发展起来，继续增加数量、提高质量，进一步满足国民经济建设需要的新的战斗任务。目前，在各方面支援下，他们一面继续新建和扩建许多机械化生产的农牧场；一面积极开展三河牛的育种工作，根据三河牛红（黄）白花、黑白花、灰白花三大类型加以整顿，选优去劣，分别培育成为乳用型、乳肉兼用型。可以期望，不要过几年，将有数量比现在更多、质量比现在更高的三河牛从呼伦贝尔草原源源运送到全国各地。（附图片）
