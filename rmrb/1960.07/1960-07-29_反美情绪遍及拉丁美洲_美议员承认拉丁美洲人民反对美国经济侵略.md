    Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: Former U.S. Senator William Benton recently published an article in the "New York Times" in which he admitted that anti-American sentiment is prevalent in Latin American countries. William Benton accompanied former U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson on a tour of twelve Latin American countries earlier this year. In this article, he admitted that he saw "open disgust" for the United States and American policies everywhere in Latin America.

    Benton said that he and Stevenson had extensive contacts with politicians, intellectuals, and industrialists in Latin American countries. In these contacts, he repeatedly heard a chorus of "complaints" against the United States.

    Benton said that Latin Americans "complained" about the following aspects of the United States: "American private enterprises use Latin America's vast wealth and natural resources to extract the essence and squeeze huge profits from the countries in which these enterprises are located"; "Americans support dictators for the sake of favorable business deals"; "New York controls Latin American raw material prices"; "Despite America's boasting of free competition and free enterprise, it imposes quotas on Latin American lead, zinc, and sugar, and taxes their copper."

    Benton admitted that the twenty Latin American countries that have been plundered by the United States "are all afflicted by varying degrees of poverty, ignorance, hunger, disease, and economic backwardness." Aware that Latin America "is brewing serious problems," Benton is very worried that "another Cuba" will emerge in Latin American countries. He admitted that Cuban Premier Castro "has a tremendous influence among students, intellectuals, and the working class in Latin America." Under these circumstances, Benton tried his best to offer advice to the U.S. government, advocating the use of economic enticements and other means against Latin American countries, in a vain attempt to obstruct the development of the Latin American national democratic movement.

    反美情绪遍及拉丁美洲
    美议员承认拉丁美洲人民反对美国经济侵略
    据新华社讯  纽约消息：前美国参议员威廉·本顿最近在“纽约时报”上发表的一篇文章中承认，反美情绪遍及拉丁美洲国家。威廉·本顿今年年初曾经随同美国民主党前总统候选人史蒂文森到十二个拉丁美洲国家进行了活动。他在这篇文章中承认，他在拉丁美洲到处看到对美国和美国政策的“公开嫌恶”情绪。
    本顿说，他和史蒂文森同拉丁美洲国家的政界人士、知识分子和工业家们进行了广泛的接触。在这些接触中，他反复听到的是一片对美国的“抱怨”声。
    本顿说，拉丁美洲人士“抱怨”美国的方面包括：“美国私人企业利用拉丁美洲的巨大财富和自然资源来吸取这些企业所在国的精华和榨取巨额利润”；“美国人为了做买卖有利而扶植独裁者”；“纽约控制拉丁美洲的原料价格”；“尽管美国吹嘘自由竞争和自由企业，却对拉丁美洲的铅、锌和食糖规定限额，对它们的铜课以税收”。
    本顿承认，遭到美国巧取豪夺的二十个拉丁美洲国家“都为不同程度的贫困、愚昧、饥饿、疾病和经济落后所折磨”，由于觉察到拉丁美洲“正在酝酿着严重问题”，本顿非常担心将在拉丁美洲国家中出现“另外的古巴”。他承认，古巴总理卡斯特罗“在拉丁美洲的学生、知识分子和劳动阶层中有着巨大的影响”。在这种情况下，本顿极力向美国政府献策，主张对拉丁美洲国家采取经济诱骗等手段，妄图借以阻挠拉丁美洲民族民主运动的发展。
