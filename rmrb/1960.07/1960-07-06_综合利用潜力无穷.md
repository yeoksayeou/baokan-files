Comprehensive Utilization Has Limitless Potential
By a Commentator from This Newspaper

Our country's agricultural and sideline products are extremely abundant, and the potential for comprehensive utilization of these products is endless. Take the common wheat straw and rapeseed stalks for example, which have traditionally been used as fodder and fuel with limited applications. However, these two resources are produced in large quantities and have great potential. With comprehensive utilization, they can become veritable treasures. Now that rapeseed harvesting is complete and winter wheat will soon be entirely harvested, localities should seize the opportunity, organize the masses, and launch a movement to fully utilize wheat straw and rapeseed stalks.

Experiences in various regions in the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw and rapeseed stalks have demonstrated that, with appropriate processing, these materials can be used to produce many daily necessities and industrial raw materials. Wheat straw can be made into starch, used for brewing wine and making sugar, and its residue can be used to make soy sauce, vinegar, pulp, and fiberboard. According to experiments in Hechi County, Guangxi, one hundred catties of wheat straw can produce sixty to seventy catties of wet starch. This starch, mixed with some wheat flour and rice flour, can be made into steamed buns, twisted rolls, pancakes, and noodles, with the same quality as those made from wheat flour. This starch is, of course, an excellent feed as well. From February to the end of May this year, Gaocheng County, Hebei, used wheat straw to produce 42,000 catties of wine, 310,000 catties of pulp, 24,000 catties of maltose, more than 2,000 catties of starch, as well as more than twenty kinds of products such as soy sauce, vinegar, and fiberboard.

Our country produces millions upon millions of tons of wheat straw and rapeseed stalks every year. If properly utilized, this represents an extremely large fortune. Every hundred catties of rapeseed stalks and pods can extract four catties of edible oil and ninety catties of oil cake. Assuming that each mu of rapeseed produces two hundred catties of usable stalks and pods, with an oil extraction rate of 4%, a total of eight catties of oil can be extracted, which is about 20% of the oil produced from rapeseed itself per mu. If all of the country’s rapeseed stalks and pods are fully utilized, it would be equivalent to increasing the unit area yield of all rapeseed fields by 20%, or equivalent to expanding the rapeseed planting area by six to seven million mu. Furthermore, wheat straw is even more abundant. Hebei Province produced about 2.4 million tons of wheat straw this year, and if half of it were utilized, it could produce more than 40,000 tons of alcohol and 600,000 tons of pulp.

Is the technology for comprehensive utilization of wheat straw and rapeseed stalks very complicated? The technology is not complicated, nor does it require special equipment. Based on the canteens, mills, and grinding shops in rural areas, supplemented with some equipment, it can be quickly implemented. Since comprehensive utilization of wheat straw and rapeseed stalks is a new undertaking, it is inevitable to encounter resistance from some old ideas during the promotion process. Some people say that for many years, the practice has always been "one thing, one use." How can wheat straw and rapeseed stalks have so many uses? In fact, "one thing, one use" is simply the result of people's exploration of the mysteries of nature not being deep enough. Every plant and animal contains a variety of chemical elements useful to mankind, only some are in higher content, some are in lower content, some are dispersed, and some are concentrated. With the improvement of science and technology, any agricultural and sideline product can be properly processed to achieve "one thing, multiple uses" and meet the diverse needs of mankind.

Large-scale comprehensive utilization of wheat straw and rapeseed stalks will also raise some new issues. If these resources are used more extensively in this way, the availability of fuel and fodder may decrease. Large-scale development may also encounter difficulties such as fuel and labor shortages. Leading organs at all levels must, like with agricultural production, take overall consideration, make comprehensive arrangements, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties, rather than retreating in the face of difficulties. There will always be difficulties, but as long as everyone truly recognizes the significant role of this undertaking in developing industrial and agricultural production and improving people's lives, determination will arise, enthusiasm will increase, solutions will emerge, and difficulties will be easily overcome. Many regions have combined the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products with the technical innovation movement, reforming tools, improving technology, and the difficulties of insufficient manpower and material resources have been quickly resolved. In Jiangjin, Sichuan and other places where steam power has been implemented, new operating methods are used to process rapeseed stalks and pods, saving about 50% of coal consumption. In Anyue and other places, stone mills for processing rapeseed pods have been replaced with iron mills, increasing efficiency by two times. For those who are determined, nothing is difficult.

    综合利用潜力无穷
    本报评论员
    我国的农副产品是极丰富的，综合利用农副产品的潜力是无穷无尽的。以常见的麦秸和油菜秸来说，历来作为饲草、燃料，用途不广。可是，这两种东西产量很多，用处很大，加以综合利用，简直都是宝贝。现在，油菜已经收打完毕，冬麦也将全部登场，各地应该抓紧时机，组织群众，开展一个运动，把麦秸、油菜秸充分利用起来。
    各地综合利用麦秸和油菜秸的经验证明：把这两种东西进行适当的加工，可以提制很多生活用品和工业原料。麦秸可以制成淀粉，造酒造糖，它的残渣还能制造酱油、醋、纸浆和纤维板。据广西河池县试验，百斤麦秸可以制成湿淀粉六、七十斤。这种淀粉掺和一些面粉和米粉，可以制成馒头、花卷、烙饼和面条，质量和面粉做的一样。这种淀粉当然更是上好的饲料。河北藁城县从今年2月到5月底，利用麦秸制成了四万二千斤酒、三十一万斤纸浆、二万四千斤饴糖、二千多斤淀粉，还有酱油、醋、纤维板等二十多种产品。
    我国每年生产千千万万吨麦秸和油菜秸，好好加以利用，实在是一笔极大的财富。每百斤油菜秸、荚，可以提取四斤食用油脂、九十斤油饼。以每亩油菜可以利用的秸、荚为二百斤、出油率为4％计算，共计榨油八斤，约为每亩油菜籽产油量的20％。如果把全国的油菜秸、荚充分利用起来，就等于把全部油菜田的单位面积产量提高了二成，或者等于把油菜播种面积扩大了六、七百万亩。再说麦秸，数量更多。河北省今年出产的麦秸约有二百四十万吨，以利用一半计算，就可以生产酒精四万多吨，纸浆六十万吨。
    综合利用麦秸、油菜秸的技术是不是很复杂呢？技术并不复杂，也不需要特殊设备，以农村中的食堂、碾坊、磨坊作基础，补充一些设备，很快就可以搞起来。由于综合利用麦秸、油菜秸是一件新事情，在推广的过程中，也难免遇到一些老观念的抗拒。有人说，多少年来，总是“一物一用”，麦秸、油菜秸哪里能有这么多的用处呢？其实，“一物一用”只是人们对于自然奥秘的探索还不精深的结果。任何动植物都含有多种多样对人类有用的化学原素，只不过有的含量多一些，有的含量少一些，有的分散些，有的集中些罢了。随着科学技术水平的提高，把任何农副产品加以适当的处理，都可以作到“一物多用”，满足人类多种多样的需要。
    大规模综合利用麦秸油菜秸，也会引起一些新问题。这方面用多了，燃料、饲草可能减少；大规模发展起来，也可能遇到燃料、劳力不足等等困难。各级领导机关要像抓农业生产一样，统筹兼顾，全面安排，领导群众逆难而进，而不要遇难而退。困难总是有的，可是，只要让大家真正认识到这件事情对发展工农业生产、对改善人民生活的重大作用，决心就来了，干劲就来了，办法也就来了，困难就容易克服了。不少地区把综合利用农副产品和技术革新运动结合起来，改革工具，改进技术，人力物力不足的困难很快得到解决。已经实现蒸气化的四川江津等地，用新的操作方法加工油菜秸、荚，用煤量节约了50％左右；安岳等地把加工油菜荚的石碾改为铁碾，提高工效两倍。对于有心的人，可见并没有难事。
