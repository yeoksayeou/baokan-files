Belgian colonial troops have begun a bloody offensive against the Congolese people. The independent Congolese people are bleeding, their blood staining the streets of Elisabethville and Luluabourg. On the evening of July 10, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba issued a call to the Congolese people: "Defend our country to the last!" The Congolese people are waging a heroic struggle to defend their hard-won independence. The Chinese people, who celebrated the independence of the Congo not long ago, stand entirely with the Congolese people in this patriotic and just struggle. The Chinese people express their boundless anger and strong protest against the aggressive crimes of the Belgian colonialists, colluding with the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, attempting to completely restore colonial rule in the Congo by force.

After the Congo declared its independence on June 30, the Belgian colonialists, unwilling to withdraw from the Congo, first refused to reorganize the Congolese army that had been used to enslave the Congolese people, monopolizing all officer positions in this army. This act of the Belgian colonialists to continue to completely control the Congolese army exposed the wolfish ambitions of the colonialists and aroused dissatisfaction among the vast number of Congolese soldiers and people. Starting on July 6, Congolese soldiers left their barracks to hold demonstrations, shouting together with the Congolese people, "Now is the time for Congolese to manage the Congo!" demanding the replacement of all colonial officers, including former Belgian colonial army commander Janssens, with Congolese. This patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese soldiers vividly reflects the Congolese people's will to achieve genuine independence!

From the very beginning of this patriotic struggle launched by Congolese soldiers, the imperialist countries have set in motion all their propaganda machines, viciously slandering the struggle of the Congolese people. Almost all Western news agencies and colonialist newspapers have falsely labeled the just action of Congolese soldiers expelling colonial officers as a "rebellion," and have tried their best to distort the struggle of Congolese soldiers and people against the colonialists as a racial dispute between blacks and whites, deliberately exaggerating the atmosphere of terror, saying that the Congolese people's struggle is directed against all Western expatriates. These imperialists, accustomed to riding on the heads of colonial peoples, simply do not take the Republic of the Congo seriously, completely disregarding the fact that today's Congo is already the Congo of the Congolese people. The world knows that the Congo has declared its independence and has elected its own government, and it is only right and natural that the Congolese army should be commanded by Congolese; this is the sovereignty of the Congo, and it is perfectly legitimate. Those who call the Congolese soldiers' action of expelling colonial officers a "rebellion" can only expose their own ugly faces as colonialists who are hostile to Congolese independence. As for describing the Congolese soldiers' struggle against the colonialists as a "terrorist action" in which Congolese generally oppose white people, this is a completely shameless fabrication. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba has made it very clear that "no action has been taken against Europeans" in the Congo. Not only that, but it should also be pointed out that this is a very insidious conspiracy by Western colonialists. Even before the Congo declared its independence, Mr. Nguvulu, Chairman of the Congolese People's Party, exposed that Belgian colonialists were preparing to find an excuse for military occupation of the Congo in order "to carry out a coup that would undermine Congolese independence." This is exactly the case. As Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba revealed on July 9, the colonialists and their agents in the Congo are carrying out a "joint conspiracy," spreading rumors in an attempt to "undermine our (Congolese) independence and provoke social unrest throughout the country." Prime Minister Lumumba also revealed that a group of Belgian colonialists "armed to the teeth" recently attempted to assassinate him. When Congolese soldiers rose up to expel Belgian colonial officers and confiscate weapons privately hidden by these colonialists, the imperialists and colonialists came out and tried their best to spread rumors around the world that "order" in the Congo was chaotic, clamoring to "protect" the "safety of expatriates," creating pretexts for launching military aggression and intervention against the Republic of the Congo.

Now, the Belgian colonialists have torn off the mask of so-called "granting" independence to the Congo, brazenly increasing their troops in the Congo and carrying out armed intervention against the patriotic struggle of the Congolese army and people. According to reports, Belgium already has 3,000 colonial troops stationed at bases in the Congo, and now it has sent four more companies of troops. The Belgian government has also announced that it will transfer 1,500 troops from within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The newly deployed Belgian colonial troops have "joined the battle" in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province in the Congo, and the Belgian colonial army stationed at bases in the Congo has also "intervened in the Congo."

Why is it that the Belgian government, which yesterday professed to "grant" "independence" to the Congo, is today sending troops to frantically attack the Republic of the Congo? The reason is very simple: it is precisely because the Congolese people can no longer tolerate Belgian colonial control and demand genuine independence, demanding to take back their army from the colonialists. This, precisely, touches the sore spot of the Belgian colonialists, who attempt to ease the Congolese people's struggle with fake independence and continue to maintain colonial rule over the Congo. The main tool for colonialists to rule colonial peoples is the army. After Congolese independence, who controlled the Congolese army? It was still controlled by Janssens, the former commander-in-chief of the Belgian colonial army. It was this General Janssens who, during the Belgian colonialists' bloody suppression of the Congolese people last year, frantically shouted: "We only used one percent of our strength. Killing a few people is to teach a lesson to those who were not hit. If they (the Congolese) don't calm down, we are ready to resume sports at any time."

What a brutal and bloodthirsty executioner he is! How can it be imagined that the Congo can achieve genuine independence if the Congolese army is still controlled by Janssens? The Congolese people understand this very well, and the Belgian colonialists also understand it very well. Precisely because of this, when the issue involves the reorganization of the Congolese regular army, the Belgian colonialists immediately put away their hypocritical smiles and drew their swords!

The Belgian colonialists' aggressive act of armed intervention in the Republic of the Congo is fully supported by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. The British Foreign Office has confirmed that the consulates of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy in Elisabethville have sent notes to the Belgian government requesting "military assistance." U.S. State Department spokesman White threatened the Congolese people, saying that the United States "is taking" all possible actions to ensure the "safety" of American expatriates. There are reports that the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, which invaded Lebanon in 1958, has entered "alert" status and is ready to go to the Congo at any time. It is also reported that the Federation of Central Africa, under the control of British colonialists, has amassed troops on the border adjacent to the Congo; Portuguese colonialists have also dispatched warships to conduct provocative demonstrations near the Congolese coast.

The old and new colonialist countries have colluded so quickly in their aggressive activities against the genuine independence of the Congolese people, precisely exposing the ambition of the imperialist countries headed by the United States to permanently occupy the Congo. The imperialists have always regarded the Congo as an important rear base, and they will never be willing to give up this colonial position. Because the Congo occupies an extremely important position in Africa, the Congo's move towards genuine independence will, to a greater extent, accelerate the development of the national independence movement in the entire sub-Saharan Black Africa. Therefore, the hostility and aggression shown by the imperialist countries headed by the United States towards the Congolese national independence movement is actually hostility and aggression towards the entire African national independence movement. On this issue, no one has spoken more bluntly than the "New York Herald Tribune." It admitted: "What is happening in the Congo goes far beyond its borders. In the emerging countries of Africa, the Congolese experience will cause a huge reaction." The propagandists of American and British imperialism fantasize about finding the "basis" for not allowing African countries to be independent from the "rebellion" in the Congo. The "New York Times" wrote in an editorial on July 7: "In the emerging African countries, there needs to be a transitional stage before independence in order to prevent disturbances similar to those in the Belgian Congo." The British "Times" also maliciously slandered in an article entitled "The Lessons of the Congo": "Purely African rule that may be implemented in such a country (the Congo) will completely revert to the traditional rule of tribal chiefs," and blatantly clamored, "The only way for the Congo to survive as an independent... nation is to establish a partnership between Belgians and Congolese Africans." Isn't the face of the imperialists exposed to the fullest? The United States and other imperialists will not automatically withdraw from the African colonies; they will never be willing to give the colonial peoples genuine independence. Isn't this another good negative example for all oppressed nations? The African people and the oppressed nations of the world who demand genuine independence must never place their hopes on the good intentions of imperialism, but only rely on their own close unity to carry out persistent struggles.

The newborn Republic of the Congo has been subjected to the brutal armed intervention of the Belgian colonialists supported by U.S. imperialism. However, the Congolese people, who are waging a just struggle for the sacred cause of national independence, cannot be subdued by the might of imperialism. People of the whole of Africa, all peace-loving people of the world, unite, support the just struggle of the Congolese people, and stop the bloody hand of imperialism from suppressing the Congolese national independence movement!

### 反对武装干涉刚果！

　　反对武装干涉刚果！
    比利时殖民军开始了对刚果人民的血腥进攻。维护独立的刚果人民，已经血染伊利沙伯维尔和路路阿堡的街头。7月10日晚上，刚果总理卢蒙巴，向刚果人民发出号召：“保卫我们的国家直到最后！”刚果人民正在为保卫已经取得的独立展开英勇的斗争。不久以前庆贺了刚果人民独立的中国人民，在刚果人民这一场爱国正义斗争中，完全站在刚果人民一边。中国人民对于比利时殖民主义者勾结以美国为首的帝国主义集团，企图以武力完全恢复在刚果的殖民统治的侵略罪行，表示无比的愤怒和强烈的抗议。
    在6月30日，刚果宣布独立之后，不甘心退出刚果的比利时殖民主义者，首先拒绝改组过去用来奴役刚果人民的由刚果人组成的军队，霸占着这支军队的全部军官职位。比利时殖民主义者这种继续完全控制刚果军队的行为，暴露了殖民主义者的狼子野心，激起了广大刚果士兵和人民的不满。从7月6日开始，刚果士兵走出兵营，举行示威，同刚果人民一起，高呼“现在是刚果人管理刚果的时候了！”要求撤换包括前比利时殖民军总司令让桑的全部殖民军官，而代之以刚果人。刚果士兵的这一爱国正义斗争，鲜明地反映了刚果人民要求真正独立的意志！
    从刚果士兵所掀起的这场爱国斗争一开始，帝国主义国家就开动了全部宣传机器，对于刚果人民的斗争进行了恶毒的诬蔑。几乎所有西方通讯社和殖民者的报刊都把刚果士兵驱逐殖民军官的正义行动诬称为“叛乱”，并且竭力把刚果士兵和人民反对殖民者的斗争歪曲为黑人与白人之间的种族纷争，故意渲染恐怖气氛，说刚果人的斗争矛头指向一切西方国家的侨民。这些帝国主义者，真是在殖民地人民的头上骑惯了，根本没有把刚果共和国放在眼里，完全无视今天的刚果已经是刚果人民的刚果了。全世界都知道，刚果已经宣布独立，并且已经选举出自己的政府，刚果国家的军队当然应该由刚果人来指挥，这是刚果的主权，是名正言顺，天经地义的。把刚果士兵驱逐那些殖民军官的行动称为“叛乱”的人们，只能暴露他们自己敌视刚果独立的殖民主义者的丑恶面目。至于把刚果士兵反对殖民主义者的斗争描写成为刚果人一般地反对白种人的“恐怖行动”，这完全是一种无耻的捏造。刚果总理卢蒙巴已经说得很清楚，在刚果，“并没有针对欧洲人采取任何行动”。不仅如此，还应该指出，这是西方殖民主义者的一个非常恶毒的阴谋。还在刚果宣布独立之前，刚果人民党主席恩居伍吕曾经揭露，比利时殖民者准备寻找借口，以便军事占领刚果，“来一次破坏刚果独立的一种政变”。事实正是这样，正如刚果总理卢蒙巴7月9日所揭露，殖民者及其在刚果的代理人正在进行着一个“联合阴谋”，他们散布谣言，企图“破坏我们（刚果）的独立，并且在全国挑起社会骚乱”。卢蒙巴总理还揭露，最近还发生了一批“武装到牙齿”的比利时殖民者企图谋杀他的案件。而在刚果士兵起来驱逐比利时殖民军官，收缴那些殖民主义者私藏的武器时，帝国主义者和殖民主义者就出来竭力向全世界散布刚果“秩序”混乱的谣言，叫嚷着要“保护”“侨民的安全”，制造借口，对刚果共和国发动军事侵略和干涉。
    现在，比利时殖民者已经揭下了它们所谓“恩赐”刚果独立的伪装，悍然增兵刚果，对刚果军民的爱国斗争进行武装干涉了。据报道，比利时在刚果基地上已经驻有三千名殖民军，现在又增派了四个连的兵力前去。比利时政府还宣布要把它在北大西洋公约组织内部的部队抽调去一千五百人。新增调的比利时殖民部队已在刚果加丹加省会伊利沙伯维尔“参加战斗”，而驻扎在刚果基地上的比利时殖民军也已“在刚果进行干涉”。
    为什么昨天刚刚自命为“恩赐”给刚果以“独立”的比利时政府，今天就出动军队，疯狂进攻刚果共和国了呢？原因很简单，这正是由于刚果人民不能继续忍受比利时殖民主义的控制，要求真正的独立，要求从殖民主义者手里夺回自己的军队。这一点，恰恰触到了企图以假独立缓和刚果人民的斗争，继续维持对刚果殖民统治的比利时殖民主义者的疼处。殖民主义者统治殖民地人民的主要工具就是军队。而在刚果独立以后，刚果人的军队控制在谁的手里呢？仍然是控制在前比利时殖民军的总司令让桑的手里。正是这个让桑将军，在去年比利时殖民者对刚果人民实行血腥镇压时，疯狂地叫嚷过：“我们仅用了百分之一的力量。打死几个人是为了教训那些没有中弹的人。如果他们（刚果人）再不安静下去，我们准备随时恢复体育运动”。　　
　　请看这是一个何等残暴的杀人不眨眼的刽子手呵！怎么能够设想，在刚果军队仍由让桑控制的情况下，刚果能够取得真正的独立呢？对于这个道理，刚果人民非常理解；而比利时殖民者也是非常理解的。正是因为这样，当问题涉及到刚果常备军改组的时候，比利时殖民者就立即收起虚伪的笑脸而拔剑出鞘了！
    比利时殖民主义者武装干涉刚果共和国的侵略行为，是得到以美国为首的帝国主义集团的全力支持的。英国外交部已经证实，美、英、法、意四国驻伊利沙伯维尔的领事馆向比利时政府提出照会，要求给予“军事援助”。美国国务院发言人怀特向刚果人民威胁说，美国“正在采取”一切可能的行动来确保美侨的“安全”。有消息说，1958年曾侵入黎巴嫩的美国第二十四步兵师已进入“警戒”状态，准备随时开往刚果。又据报道，在英国殖民者控制下的中非联邦已经在同刚果接壤的边境集结军队；葡萄牙殖民者也派出军舰，在刚果海岸附近进行挑衅性示威。
    新老殖民主义国家，在反对刚果人民真正独立的侵略活动中，这样迅速地勾结起来，正是暴露了以美国为首的帝国主义国家企图永远霸占刚果的野心。帝国主义者一向把刚果视为它们重要的后方基地，它们决不甘心放弃这个殖民阵地，并且由于刚果在非洲处于极为重要的地位，刚果走向真正的独立，将会在更大程度上加速撒哈拉以南整个黑非洲的民族独立运动的发展。因之，以美国为首的帝国主义国家对于刚果民族独立运动表现出来的这种仇视和进攻，实际上也就是对于整个非洲民族独立运动的仇视和进攻。在这个问题上，再也没有比“纽约先驱论坛报”说得更赤裸裸的了。它供认：“刚果发生的事情远远超过了它的边界。在非洲新兴国家内，刚果的经验将会引起巨大反应”。美英帝国主义的宣传家们，妄想从刚果的“叛乱”中找到不准非洲国家独立的“根据”。“纽约时报”在7月7　日的社论中写道：“在新兴的非洲国家中，需要有一个独立之前的过渡阶段，以便防止发生类似比属刚果的骚乱”。英国“泰晤士报”在一篇题为“刚果的教训”的文章中也恶意地诬蔑说：“在这样一个国家（刚果）里可能实行的纯粹非洲式的统治，将完全回复到传统的酋长的部落统治”，并且露骨地叫嚷，“刚果要作为一个独立……国家生存下去，唯一的办法只有使比利时人和刚果非洲人建立伙伴关系。”帝国主义者的嘴脸，岂不是暴露得淋漓尽致了吗！美国和其它帝国主义者是不会自动退出非洲殖民地的，它们绝不会甘心给予殖民地人民以真正独立的。对于一切被压迫民族来说，这难道不是又一个很好的反面教材吗？非洲人民和全世界被压迫民族要求取得真正的独立，绝不能够把希望寄托在帝国主义发善心，而只有依靠自己紧密地团结起来，进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    新生的刚果共和国，已经遭到了美帝国主义支持的比利时殖民主义者横暴的武装干涉，但是，为民族独立的神圣事业而进行正义斗争的刚果人民，是帝国主义的淫威所不能屈服的。全非洲人民、全世界一切爱好和平的人民，团结起来，声援刚果人民的正义斗争，制止帝国主义镇压刚果民族独立运动的血手！
