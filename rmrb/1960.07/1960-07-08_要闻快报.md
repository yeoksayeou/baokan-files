    Shenyang Smelter Launches Mass Scientific Research
    Shenyang Smelter has launched a mass scientific research movement. In addition to sending 270 workers for professional scientific training, it has also established more than 300 professional and amateur scientific research organizations in factories, workshops, work sections, and teams. Workers participating in scientific research account for 85% of the total number of employees in the factory. Through research and experimentation, the factory has successfully tested more than 400 new products this year. At present, more than 3,400 workers in the factory can independently conduct scientific research and experiments, and 37 people have been promoted to engineers, and more than 100 workers have been promoted to technicians, so that the proportion of worker technical cadres in the factory's engineering and technical personnel has increased from 8% last year to 43%.
    
    Fenghuangshan Iron Mine Comprehensively Transforms Internal Transportation
    Nanjing Fenghuangshan Iron Mine has carried out a comprehensive technical transformation of internal transportation, and has fully realized track laying, locomotive operation, hopperization, chute utilization, and hoisting. From mining, crushing, loading, and transportation to the ore leaving the factory, a "one-stop" transportation system has been realized, solving the contradiction that internal transportation cannot keep up with mining and crushing, and promoting production. By the end of June, this mine had nearly completed 60% of its annual plan.
    
    Strengthen Grassroots Leadership and Establish Core Groups
    The production teams of Guangxi Heshan Coal Mine have established core groups to give full play to the core leadership role.
    In order to improve production, the core groups of each team not only focus on ideological work and the completion of production tasks, but also take care of a series of management tasks in the production process. In the Lilan mining area, the core group members of each team in the recovery, tunneling, and transportation work areas lead the workers to participate in management, establish team economic accounting, establish a tool handover system by calculating the loss of tools and materials, and formulate a complete set of tool and material management systems, so that everyone manages tools and materials in an orderly manner. The cost of raw coal in the working face of the recovery work area has been reduced by nearly half.
    
    Develop Diversified Operations to Increase Raw Materials for Light Industry
    Factories in the light industry system of Gansu Province have vigorously carried out comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, increasing the number of products by more than 450. They have also produced a large number of important light industrial raw materials and materials that have always relied on supplies from other regions, such as tannin extract, alum, red alum, rosin, pulp, cork paper (bricks), hide glue, flake soda, soda ash, fusel oil, lanolin, and riboflavin. The raw material needs of some factories have been basically met, and some varieties have begun to be transferred out to support other regions.
    
    Utilizing Wild Plants, Winery Produces Year-Round
    Tonghua Winery in Jilin Province has widely used wild plants in mountainous areas to successfully trial-produce ten kinds of fruit wines such as ginseng wine, Schisandra wine, mountain ash wine, jujube wine, and hawthorn wine, changing the past state of half a year of production and half a year of idleness. At the same time, it also used waste liquid and waste residue to trial-produce more than 30 kinds of chemical products such as ethanol, acetone tartaric acid, and antimony tartrate. The factory has developed from single-variety production to multi-variety production, and has comprehensively completed the annual national plan more than seven months ahead of schedule.
