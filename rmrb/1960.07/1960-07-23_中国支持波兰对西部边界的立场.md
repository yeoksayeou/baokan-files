Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Polish Ambassador to China, Knothe, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the National Day of the Polish People's Republic.  Speaking at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi declared: "The Chinese Government and the Chinese people firmly support the solemn position of the Polish Government on the issue of the western border. We have always believed that the Oder-Neisse line is the final border and that it is absolutely not allowed to be changed.  Anyone who dares to carry out aggression and provocation against the Polish People's Republic will definitely be met with a united and resolute counterattack from the entire socialist camp and will suffer a crushing defeat."

Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. He once again warned U.S. imperialism "not to make wrong estimates of the situation." He said: The great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and the united front of the people of the world against imperialism headed by the United States is also being consolidated and developed as never before. Any attempt by U.S. imperialism to launch new military adventures will inevitably meet with even more disastrous failures than in the past.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also said: "We Chinese people love peace and have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and have made unremitting efforts for this. However, we believe that only by continuing to strengthen the forces of the people of the world and continuing to develop the struggles of the people of the world, will it be possible to maintain world peace and to force the imperialist countries to accept, to varying degrees, a situation of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.”

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

Tonight, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Shen Junru and Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang and Burhan, also attended the reception.

The grand reception was held in the newly built and beautiful Polish Embassy.  When Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke, he first extended warm congratulations and high respect to the Polish Government and the Polish people on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. He said: For sixteen years, the heroic Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Worker’s Party, have carried out extensive socialist transformation and large-scale socialist construction, and have achieved brilliant successes. Today, Poland has become a socialist country with advanced industry. Poland's industrial output has increased more than five times compared with pre-war levels, and agricultural production has also made great progress. With the continuous victories in economic construction, Poland's cultural and scientific undertakings have developed rapidly, and the people's socialist consciousness has also been significantly improved. The grand plan for Poland's development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965, formulated by the Third Congress of the Polish United Worker's Party last year, has shown the Polish people an even brighter vision and has been enthusiastically supported by the entire Polish people. At present, the Polish people are working selflessly to strive for the victorious realization of this plan.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: The Polish People's Republic unswervingly pursues a peaceful foreign policy, constantly puts forward positive and meaningful peace initiatives, and has made significant contributions to easing international tensions, maintaining European security and world peace. Poland has also actively participated in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Commissions in Indochina, and has made valuable efforts to maintain peace in Asia. All of these have been warmly welcomed and supported by peace-loving people and countries around the world, greatly enhancing Poland's international standing and international prestige.

He pointed out: The Polish government and people have always maintained a high degree of vigilance against the resurgence of West German militarism and against the ambition of West German revanchists to change the Oder-Neisse border, and have waged a resolute struggle against it. Recently, Adenauer openly issued war cries, declaring that he would rely on West Germany's "allies" to "restore" East Prussia. This is a serious provocation to European peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: The recent war cries and war activities of West German militarist forces are by no means accidental phenomena; they are an important part of the U.S. imperialist plan to intensify international tensions and prepare for a new war. Recently, U.S. imperialism has carried out a series of new aggressions and provocations around the world. In Asia, U.S. imperialism directed Nobusuke Kishi to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and actively strengthened war preparations in South Korea and South Vietnam. In Africa, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, supported the armed aggression of the Belgian colonialists against the Congo, and on the other hand, intensified its interference in the Congo in the name of the United Nations. In Latin America, U.S. imperialism is manipulating the Organization of American States, plotting large-scale intervention in Cuba, and brazenly shelling the Cuban coast, carrying out military threats against the Cuban people. While launching these aggressions and provocations, U.S. imperialism has not relaxed its arms expansion and war preparations in Europe in the slightest. U.S. imperialism is further strengthening its control over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, expanding missile bases, and using its military bases in Europe to send spy planes to invade Soviet airspace once again. It is particularly noteworthy that U.S. imperialism is vigorously supporting West German militarism and actively preparing to arm the West German army with nuclear weapons. U.S. President Eisenhower issued a so-called "Captive Nations Week" proclamation on July 18, once again declaring without concealment that the United States adheres to its policy of aggression and subversion against socialist countries. U.S. imperialism's arrogant attempt, coupled with its series of arms expansion and war preparations, shows that U.S. imperialism is actively planning new adventures in Europe, just as it is in other regions. This deserves serious vigilance from the people of the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized: However, these wars and aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism will neither frighten the great socialist camp nor the people of all countries struggling for world peace, democratic freedom, national independence, and socialism, but will instead make it more and more isolated. At present, not only in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is surging, but also in Western countries, the struggle of the broad people against U.S. imperialist aggression, against the revival of West German militarism, against American military bases, and against domestic monopoly groups following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war has also developed rapidly. This is an excellent situation for winning world peace. He said: The forces of the socialist camp, the forces of struggle of the people of Western countries, the national democratic forces of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving forces in the world must further unite, heighten their vigilance, and persist in struggle. Any attempt by U.S. imperialism to launch new military adventures will inevitably suffer more disastrous defeats than in the past.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally said: The people of China and Poland have a long and profound friendship. After liberation, common interests and common ideals have linked us closely together. In the past ten years, the leaders of the parties and governments of China and Poland have made many friendly visits and close talks with each other, and both sides have signed a series of agreements on trade, shipping, culture, and science and technology. Mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in political, economic, and cultural fields have achieved comprehensive development. The Polish government and the Polish people have consistently and resolutely supported the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the safeguarding of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Polish government has also sent many excellent experts and provided many advanced technical equipment to help our country carry out socialist construction. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this fraternal support and assistance from the Polish people. We firmly believe that with the development of the socialist construction of the two countries, our relations of mutual assistance and cooperation will surely increase day by day, thereby making greater contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to the cause of defending world peace. Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the health of the Polish party and government leaders headed by Comrade Gomulka.

Ambassador Knothe spoke at the beginning of the reception. He first spoke about the construction achievements of the Polish People's Republic over the past sixteen years. He said: The victorious ideology of our time—Marxism-Leninism, the principles of socialism—was in the past and still is the basis for transformations in all aspects of life.

The ambassador said: Before the war, two-thirds of our country's population was engaged in agriculture; now, only 42% of Poland's population is engaged in agriculture. At the same time, our agricultural output has increased by 36.5% per capita. Poland has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. Compared with 1937, our total industrial output value has increased sixfold, and sevenfold per capita. In our country, it has also been proven that socialism is superior to capitalism and that socialism has advantages in the peaceful competition between the two political systems.

The ambassador said: Surrounding us is great peaceful labor. We need peace in order to realize our plans. We need peace in order to heal all the wounds of war. Peace is synonymous with the system we are building. Today, we have friendly and fraternal relations with all our neighbors. Eternal friendship links us with the most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union. We hold deep gratitude and respect for the Soviet Union, thanking them for setting an example in building socialism and helping to liberate and rebuild our country.

The ambassador said: A chain of warm friendship links us with the People's Republic of China. This chain of friendship is based on unbreakable ideas and consistent goals. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism. Our goal is to build socialism, a better life, and the happiness of the people. Our friendship develops, consolidates, and deepens day by day.

The ambassador said: Mutual exchange of experience enables us to carry out our socialist construction faster and better. The Polish people watch with admiration the speed of China's rapid development under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and we rejoice in the continuous development of relations between our two countries.

The ambassador said: Fraternal friendly relations with all countries in the socialist camp unite us together. We are a powerful and unified link in the socialist camp, which constitutes a decisive force in defending peace.

The ambassador said: The guarantee of our security and sovereignty is not only our growing economic strength, which increases year by year, but also the strength of the powerful Soviet Union and People's China, and the strength of the entire socialist camp—our common strength.

The ambassador said: We have never fantasized that the imperialist war adventure groups will willingly accept our idea of peaceful coexistence, voluntarily abandon war preparations, and agree to universal and complete disarmament. The Polish people, with vigilance deepened by bitter historical experience, oppose the revival of German militarism, which is being fanatically supported by the imperialist Cold War groups, especially the U.S. imperialist aggression group, in West Germany. We participate now and will continue to participate unremittingly in the struggle for peace, the easing of international tensions, disarmament, and peaceful coexistence. We believe in the victory of the socialist camp's peace policy. This belief is based on the socialist countries' growing strength and unshakable unity year by year, as well as the growing strength of the struggle of the people throughout the world who strongly demand peace and oppose the imperialist war forces. The growth of the socialist camp's strength, the struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries for political and economic independence, and the struggle of the masses of people in capitalist countries are limiting the activities of the imperialist war groups, thereby increasing the possibility of defeating the forces of war and ensuring lasting peace among the peoples of all countries. Ambassador Knothe also proposed a toast to the heroic Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi.

After Ambassador Knothe and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and Poland respectively.

When Ambassador Knothe made a second toast, he proposed a toast to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders. Premier Zhou Enlai also raised his glass to toast the unity of the Chinese and Polish peoples, to the health of the leaders of the Polish People's Republic, and to the health of the host of the banquet and all foreign guests.

This grand reception proceeded in an atmosphere of friendship from beginning to end. Among the ambassador's guests were also Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, President of the Sino-Polish Friendship Association Shen Yanbing, responsible persons from various departments of state organs and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

    陈毅副总理在波兰大使举行的国庆招待会上说
    中国支持波兰对西部边界的立场
    警告美帝不要对形势作出错误估计，任何新的军事冒险的尝试定会遭更惨重失败
    周恩来总理出席招待会祝中波两国人民的团结
    新华社22日讯　波兰驻中国大使克诺泰今晚举行盛大招待会庆祝波兰人民共和国国庆十六周年。陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话时宣称：“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持波兰政府关于西部边界问题的严正立场。我们一向认为奥得—尼斯河边界是最后的边界，是绝不容许加以改变的。任何人如果敢于向波兰人民共和国进行侵略和挑衅，它就一定会在社会主义阵营全体一致的坚决回击下碰得头破血流。”
    陈毅副总理强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。他再一次警告美帝国主义“不要对形势作出错误的估计”。他说：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结是牢不可破的，全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线也正在空前地巩固和发展。美帝国主义发动新的军事冒险的任何尝试一定会遭到比过去更惨重的失败。
    陈毅副总理还说：“我们中国人民热爱和平，一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且为此作了不懈的努力。但是，我们认为只有继续壮大世界人民的力量，继续发展世界人民的斗争，才有可能使世界和平得到维护，才有可能迫使帝国主义国家不得不在不同程度上接受不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处局面。”
    周恩来总理出席了招待会。
    今晚，沈钧儒、彭真副委员长，习仲勋副总理，政协全国委员会李四光、包尔汉副主席等，都出席了招待会。
    盛大的招待会在新建的美丽的波兰大使馆里举行。陈毅副总理讲话时，首先代表中国政府和中国人民向波兰政府和波兰人民表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。他说：十六年来，英雄的波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，进行了广泛的社会主义改造和规模巨大的社会主义建设，并且取得了辉煌的成就。今天，波兰已经成为一个具有先进工业的社会主义国家。波兰的工业产值比战前提高了五倍多，农业生产也有了很大的发展。随着经济建设的不断胜利，波兰的文化科学事业有了迅速的进展，人民的社会主义觉悟也有了显著的提高。去年波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会所制定的1959年至1965年波兰发展国民经济的宏伟计划，向波兰人民展示出一幅更加美好的远景，得到全体波兰人民的热烈拥护。目前波兰人民正在以忘我的劳动，为胜利地实现这一计划而奋斗。
    陈毅副总理说：波兰人民共和国坚持不渝地奉行和平外交政策，不断地提出富有积极意义的和平倡议，为缓和国际紧张局势、维护欧洲安全和世界和平作出了重大的贡献。波兰还积极地参加了朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际委员会的工作，对维护亚洲和平也作出了宝贵的努力。所有这些都得到了全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的热烈欢迎和支持，大大提高了波兰的国际地位和国际威望。
    他指出：波兰政府和人民对于西德军国主义的复活，对于西德复仇主义者企图改变奥得—尼斯河边界的野心，一向保持着高度的警惕，并且进行着坚决的斗争。最近以来，阿登纳公然发出了战争叫嚣，宣布要依靠西德的“盟友”“恢复”东普鲁士。这是对于欧洲和平的严重挑衅。
    陈毅副总理说：西德军国主义势力最近的战争叫嚣和战争活动，绝不是偶然的现象，它是美帝国主义加剧国际紧张局势、准备新战争的计划中的一个重要组成部分。最近美帝国主义在全世界进行了一系列新的侵略和挑衅。在亚洲，美帝国主义指使岸信介强行通过了日美军事同盟条约，并且积极加强在南朝鲜和南越南的备战活动。在非洲，美帝国主义一面支持比利时殖民主义者对刚果的武装侵略，一面在联合国的名义下加紧对刚果的干涉活动。在拉丁美洲，美帝国主义正在操纵美洲国家组织，阴谋策划对古巴的大规模干涉，并且悍然炮击古巴海岸，对古巴人民进行军事威胁。美帝国主义在发动这些侵略和挑衅的同时，丝毫也没有放松它在欧洲的扩军备战活动。美帝国主义正在进一步加强对北大西洋条约组织的控制，扩大导弹基地，并且利用它在欧洲的军事基地，派遣间谍飞机再一次侵犯苏联领空。特别值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在大力扶植西德军国主义，积极准备以核武器武装西德军队。美国总统艾森豪威尔在7月18日发布了一个所谓“被奴役国家周”的文告，又一次毫不掩饰地宣称美国对社会主义国家坚持侵略和颠复的政策。美帝国主义的这种狂妄企图连同它一系列的扩军备战活动，说明美帝国主义在欧洲也同在其它地区一样，正在积极策划新的冒险。这是值得引起全世界人民严重警惕的。
    陈毅副总理强调说：但是，美帝国主义的这些战争和侵略活动既吓不倒伟大的社会主义阵营，也吓不倒为世界和平、民主自由、民族独立和社会主义而斗争的各国人民，反而使它自己陷于越来越孤立的地位。目前，不仅在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在风起云涌，而且在西方国家，广大人民反对美帝国主义侵略、反对复活西德军国主义、反对美国军事基地、反对本国垄断集团追随美国扩军备战的斗争也有了迅速的发展。这是争取世界和平的大好形势。他说：社会主义阵营的力量，西方各国人民斗争的力量，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主力量和全世界一切爱好和平的力量，进一步团结起来，提高警惕，坚持斗争，美帝国主义发动新的军事冒险的任何尝试就一定会遭到比过去更惨重的失败。
    陈毅副总理最后说：中波两国人民有着悠久的深厚友谊。解放之后，共同的利益和共同的理想又把我们紧紧地连接在一起。十年来中波两国的党和政府领导人曾经多次相互进行友好访问和亲密会谈，双方签订了贸易、航运、文化和科学技术等一系列的协定。两国在政治、经济和文化方面的互助合作获得了全面的发展。波兰政府和波兰人民一贯坚决支持中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护主权和领土完整的斗争。波兰政府还派来了许多优秀的专家，提供了许多先进的技术设备，帮助我国进行社会主义建设。中国人民对于波兰人民这种兄弟般的支持和帮助，表示衷心的感谢。我们深信，随着两国社会主义建设事业的发展，我们之间的互助合作关系一定会与日俱增，从而对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，和保卫世界和平的事业做出更大的贡献。陈毅副总理提议为以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰党政领导同志的健康干杯。
    克诺泰大使在招待会开始的时候讲了话。他首先谈到了十六年来波兰人民共和国的建设成就。他说：我们时代的胜利的思想——马克思列宁主义、社会主义的原则——过去是现在仍是生活各方面转变的基础。
    大使说：战前，我们国家的三分之二的人口从事农业，现在波兰的农业人口只有42％。同时，我们的农业产量以平均人口计算增长了36.5％。波兰已从落后的农业国变成了工业农业国。与1937年相比较，我们的工业总产值增加了六倍，按平均人口计算增加了七倍。在我们国家里也证明了社会主义胜过资本主义以及社会主义在两种政治制度和平竞赛中的优越性。
    大使说：围绕着我们的是伟大的和平的劳动。我们需要和平，为了实现我们的计划。我们需要和平，为了医治所有的战争创伤。和平是我们所建设的制度的同义词。今天我们和我们所有的邻国有着友好的兄弟的关系。永恒的友谊联接着我们和最强大的社会主义国家苏联。我们对苏联怀着深切的感激与敬意，感谢他们为建设社会主义树立了榜样并帮助解放和重建了我们的国家。
    大使说：热情的友谊的锁链联接着我们和中华人民共和国。这种友谊的锁链是奠基在牢不可破的思想和一致的目的基础之上的。我们的思想是马克思列宁主义。我们的目的是建设社会主义、美好的生活和人民的幸福。我们的友谊一天比一天地发展、巩固和加深。
    大使说：相互交流经验使我们能更快和更好地进行我们的社会主义建设。波兰人民怀着钦佩的心情注视着中国在中国共产党的英明的领导下飞跃发展的速度，我们为我们两国之间的关系的不断发展而欢欣。
    大使说：同社会主义阵营所有国家的兄弟般的友好关系把我们联结在一起。我们是社会主义阵营团结一致的有力的一环，这个阵营构成了保卫和平的决定性力量。
    大使说：我们的安全和主权的保证不仅是我们的一年比一年增长的经济力量，而且也是强大的苏联和人民中国以及整个社会主义阵营的力量——我们共同的力量。
    大使说：我们从未幻想过帝国主义的战争冒险集团将会出自本意地接受我们的和平共处的思想，将会自愿地放弃备战并赞同普遍彻底裁军。波兰人民怀着被沉重的历史经验而加深的警惕性反对被帝国主义冷战集团，尤其是被美帝国主义侵略集团在西德狂热扶持的德国军国主义的复活。我们现在和将来都坚持不懈地参加为和平、国际局势的缓和、裁军和和平共处而进行的斗争，我们相信社会主义阵营的和平政策的胜利。这一信念是基于社会主义国家一年比一年增长的力量和不可动摇的团结，还基于全世界热烈要求和平并反对帝国主义战争势力的人民的斗争在不断增强。社会主义阵营力量的增长，殖民地和附属国人民为争取政治经济独立的斗争，以及资本主义国家的人民群众的斗争，正限制着帝国主义战争集团的活动。从而增加了战胜战争势力和保证各国人民间持久和平的可能性。克诺泰大使还提议为以毛泽东同志为首的英雄的中国共产党，为刘少奇主席的健康，干杯。
    在克诺泰大使和陈毅副总理讲话以后，乐队分别奏中国和波兰两国的国歌。
    克诺泰大使在第二次祝酒的时候，提议为周恩来总理和其他领导人的健康干杯。周恩来总理也举杯祝中波两国人民的团结，祝波兰人民共和国领导人健康，祝宴会的主人和所有外宾健康。
    这个盛大的招待会自始至终都在友谊的气氛中进行。在大使的客人中，还有外交部副部长章汉夫、罗贵波，中波友好协会会长沈雁冰，国家机关各部门和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，以及各方面的人士，各国驻华使节和外交官员。
