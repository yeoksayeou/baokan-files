	In the High Tide of Supporting Agriculture

	Hunan Handicraft Workers Go to the Countryside to Repair Farm Tools
	Handicraft departments in Hunan Province are implementing the principle of "repair being primary, with repair and manufacturing combined," organizing 180,000 iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers to go to the countryside to repair and manufacture small farm tools to support the upcoming rush to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice production in rural areas. By the end of June, various localities had organized 20,000 repair stations and more than 14,000 mobile repair teams. The province has repaired and manufactured more than 25 million pieces of farm tools such as rice sickles, drying mats, manure buckets, sieves, and baskets.

	Transferring Fine Seeds to Support Summer Planting
	Food and commercial departments in Sichuan Province are transporting large quantities of late rice, miscellaneous grains, melons, beans, and vegetable seeds to rural areas to support rural people's communes in expanding summer planting areas.
	This year, due to the expansion of summer planting areas and the implementation of replanting, supplementary planting, and increased planting in various parts of Sichuan, the demand for late autumn crop seeds in rural areas has increased compared to previous years. Food and commercial departments throughout the province arranged seeds such as autumn potatoes, buckwheat, sweet potatoes, and corn before the summer harvest to ensure timely planting.
	Food and commercial departments in various localities generally select seeds strictly in advance, trying their best to supply fine seeds. They are all dried, selected, and disinfected before transportation, and after testing, the germination rate is very high.

	Machines Go to the Countryside, Technology Follows
	The Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, a state-owned enterprise in Jiangsu, produced a total of 2,190 agricultural diesel engines with more than 110,000 horsepower in the first half of this year. As a large number of machines went to the countryside, the factory dispatched technical workers to rural areas inside and outside the province from May onwards, even as far as rural areas in autonomous regions such as Guangxi and Xinjiang, to impart technology and repair diesel engines. In particular, for some areas that were using diesel engines for the first time, outstanding technical workers were selected to go and impart technology.

	Agricultural Aviation Team Serves Agriculture
	China's agricultural aviation industry has initially taken shape with the great leap forward in the national economy over the past two years, and has achieved remarkable results in spraying pesticides, sowing seeds, and artificial rainfall.
	In the first half of this year, the number of aircraft dispatched to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests increased by 39 percent compared with the same period last year. According to statistics from Henan Province, the use of aircraft to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests in the first half of this year not only replaced approximately 300,000 manual laborers, but also saved 300,000 yuan in drug costs due to the reduced use of pesticides.

	Repairing and Supplying Machines and Tools on the Front Lines of Production
	Under the leadership of the Yangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 30 county-run factories and mines in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, extracted more than 200 technical workers to form repair and supply shock teams, and went deep into the forefront of drought resistance to help people's communes repair and supply machines and tools. In the past ten days, they have rushed to repair more than 24,500 pieces of equipment such as water pumps, and helped communes install 58 power machines. Various factories and mines have also extracted 30 water pumps, 4,000 meters of rubber hose, and 6,500 meters of ceramic pipe to support the fight against drought.

    在支援农业的高潮中
    湖南手工业工人下乡修农具
    湖南省手工业部门贯彻“以修为主、修制并举”的原则，组织十八万名铁、木、篾业手工业工人，到农村修理和制造小农具，支援农村即将开始的抢收早稻和抢插晚稻生产。到6月底止，各地已组织两万个修配站，一万四千多个流动修理组，全省已修理和制造禾镰、晒簟、扮桶、围折、箩筐等农具二千五百多万件。
    调运良种支援夏种
    四川省粮食、商业部门把大批晚稻、杂粮、瓜豆、蔬菜种子运往农村，支援农村人民公社扩大夏种面积。
    今年四川各地由于扩大夏种面积，实行改种、补种、增种，农村需要的晚秋作物种子比往年增多。全省粮食、商业部门早在夏收以前就安排了秋洋芋、荞麦、红薯、玉米等种子，保证了适时下种。
    各地粮食、商业部门一般都事先严格挑选种子，尽量供应良种。在调运前都经过晒、选、消毒，经试验，发芽率很高。
    机器到农村技术跟下乡
    江苏国营无锡柴油机厂今年上半年共生产农用柴油机二千一百九十台、十一万多马力。随着大批机器下乡，这个厂从五月份起派出技术工人分赴省内外农村，甚至远到广西、新疆等自治区的农村，传授技术，检修柴油机。特别对有些初次使用柴油机的地区，选派了优秀的技术工人前往传授技术。
    农业航空队伍为农业服务
    我国农业航空事业随着两年来国民经济的大跃进，已经初具规模，在喷撒农药、播种、人工降雨等方面都获得显著成就。
    今年半年来，为防治农作物病虫害出动的飞机，比去年同期增加百分之三十九。据河南省统计，今年半年来使用飞机防治农作物病虫害，不仅代替了大约三十万个人工，而且由于用药少，节约了三十万元的药费。
    到生产第一线修配机具
    山西省阳城县三十多个县营厂矿，在中共阳城县委领导下，抽出二百多名技术工人组成修配突击队，深入抗旱最前线帮助人民公社修配机具。在最近十天中，他们就抢修好了水泵等设备的机件二万四千五百多件，并帮助公社安装了五十八部动力机械。各厂矿还抽出三十台水泵、四千米胶管、六千五百米陶瓷管，支援了抗旱斗争。
