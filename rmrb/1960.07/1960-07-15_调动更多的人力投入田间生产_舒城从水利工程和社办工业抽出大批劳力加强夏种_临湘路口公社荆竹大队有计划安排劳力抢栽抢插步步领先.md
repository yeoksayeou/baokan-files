　　Mobilizing More Manpower into Field Production
　　Shucheng Draws Large Numbers of Laborers from Water Conservancy Projects and Township-Run Industries to Strengthen Summer Planting
　　Jingzhu Brigade of Lukou Commune in Linxiang Arranges Labor in a Planned Way, Seizing Planting Opportunities and Staying Ahead Step by Step
　　(Our newspaper Hefei, 14th dispatch) The Shucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui Province conscientiously implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, putting all available manpower and materials into agricultural production. The number of people participating in agricultural production in the county accounted for 82% of the total labor force. Industry, commerce, education, and the military all revolved around agricultural production, carrying out various activities to serve agriculture.
    The summer planting in Shucheng County has basically ended, with 250,000 mu of intermediate rice and 180,000 mu of dry land crops waiting to be managed; 300,000 mu of early rice is about to be harvested; 200,000 mu of double-cropped late rice is waiting to be transplanted, and the corresponding task of accumulating fertilizer is also very large. It is currently at the most intense juncture of the year's agricultural activities. In view of this situation, the Shucheng County Party Committee adopted the method of "three guarantees and one release," with the county party committee responsible for the communes, departments responsible for the communes, the commune secretary and members responsible for the brigades, and layers of decentralization, to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production.
    In order to concentrate the main forces on doing a good job in agricultural production, in recent days alone, more than 1,300 non-agricultural production laborers have been drawn from county-level factories, mines, and towns. Together with those transferred in the past, there are a total of more than 4,500 people. In addition, 12,000 people were drawn from 20,000 water conservancy workers to participate in agricultural production. The eleven communes in the county also drew nearly 10,000 people from township-run industries, welfare services, culture, education, and health to engage in summer planting and field management.
    The county party committee's industry and transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, and health departments, in addition to drawing cadres and employees to go to the countryside to directly participate in production as much as possible, also arranged various tasks of their departments under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. The County Agricultural Machinery Factory decided to suspend the production of hemp spinning machines and looms, concentrating its efforts on rushing to manufacture threshing machines and sprayers. The commercial departments also carried out activities centered on preparing for "three preventions" (flood, drought, pests) and "double rush" (rush harvesting and rush planting), first ensuring the supply of oil for irrigation and drainage machinery and the preparation of various agricultural tools such as sickles and bamboo baskets. They also increased the original number of people who regularly delivered goods to the countryside from more than 340 to more than 400, carrying out door-to-door purchases and delivering goods to the labor sites and canteens. In addition to continuing to send capable cadres to strengthen the leadership of the communes assigned to their departments and organizing teachers and students and cadres from institutions to seize the holidays to accumulate and deliver fertilizer to the countryside, the culture and education departments also, based on the current hot weather, organized more than 50% of the medical and health personnel from county-level hospitals to provide mobile medical care in the fields.
    The county party committee especially emphasized the leadership of backward areas, such as the Siwei Brigade of Longshu Commune, which had a poor completion rate of wheat planting and 18% of the seedlings planted were of the third category. After the county party committee discovered this, it immediately transferred eleven cadres from the county and commune levels to serve as brigade or production team cadres, leading production, and assigned a commune party committee secretary to reside permanently in the brigade to provide specific leadership. At the same time, it allocated 10,000 yuan to support the brigade's production, determined to help the brigade catch up with the advanced teams as soon as possible.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha dispatch) Jingzhu Brigade and Shishan Brigade of Lukou Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan, adopted two different methods in the arrangement of labor, and two different results appeared in production. Recently, after learning from the experience of Jingzhu Brigade, Shishan Brigade properly arranged the labor force, and the field management of early and intermediate rice has caught up.
    Due to the comprehensive arrangement of labor and the concentration of elite troops and capable generals into the field management of early and intermediate rice, the 2,005 mu of early rice seedlings in Jingzhu Brigade grew lush and green, basically eliminating third-class seedlings; intermediate rice, miscellaneous grains, and economic crops also generally underwent topdressing and intertillage, growing well. The summer sowing area was expanded by 24% compared with last year, the number of pigs in stock increased by nearly one time compared with last year, and other sideline production also had great development.
    The main experience of Jingzhu Brigade in comprehensively arranging labor is: First, rationally arrange the labor force according to the busy and slack agricultural seasons. After concentrating superior forces to achieve the victory of rushing to harvest spring crops and rushing to transplant early rice some time ago, in addition to arranging 60% of the labor force to strengthen the field management of early rice and the transplanting of intermediate rice and single-season late rice, it immediately transferred 16.6% of the labor force to rush to plant 750 mu of vegetables, collected more than 90,000 jin of pig feed, and finished picking the second round of spring tea. Recently, seizing the key period for increasing the production of early and intermediate rice, it arranged 77% of the total labor force to engage in large-scale field management, with the rest engaged in animal husbandry, aquaculture, sideline occupations, and welfare services. Second, do everything possible to tap labor potential. The Party General Branch adopted methods such as "refining, replacing, saving, and squeezing" to transfer young and middle-aged laborers to the front line of production. The entire brigade added 194 young and middle-aged laborers to the front line of production. Third, rationally divide labor according to the characteristics of agricultural work and technical expertise. Fourth, comprehensively arrange and cooperate, and temporarily concentrate superior forces, distinguish between primary and secondary, and organize segmented and itemized assaults according to the characteristics of seasonal climate changes, so that production tasks are completed on time and with quality. Fifth, ensure that members have eight hours of sleep and four hours of rest time every day, so that members are full of energy and production efficiency is greatly improved.
    The natural conditions and labor burden of Shishan Brigade are the same as those of Jingzhu Brigade, but the production once showed a different situation from that of Jingzhu Brigade. After inspection and analysis: the main reason is that the idea of "taking grain as the key link and achieving overall leap forward" was not clear enough. Although subjectively wanting to do a good job in all tasks, due to the failure to distinguish between primary and secondary priorities in the use of leadership, cadre strength, and labor, it was busy with one thing and lost sight of another. As a result, no work was done well. For example, when spring harvest and early rice transplanting entered a tense stage, the brigade only arranged 60% of the labor force to go into battle, thus delaying the early rice transplanting season and bringing heavy tasks to summer field management. However, this situation has not yet attracted the attention of the brigade leadership, and the labor force has not been rationally adjusted. Only 52% of the total labor force is arranged on the main agricultural battlefield, and there are not many young and middle-aged people among them. As a result, the progress of early rice topdressing and intertillage is very slow, there are many third-class seedlings, and the summer sowing plan has not been completed well enough.
    After learning from the experience of Jingzhu Brigade, Shishan Brigade concentrated 85% of its members to work hard in field management.
    As of June 25, the proportion of third-class seedlings in the whole team has dropped from 30% to 8%, and the proportion of first-class seedlings is 70%. Other tasks have also kept up. (Attached pictures)

　　调动更多的人力投入田间生产
　　舒城从水利工程和社办工业抽出大批劳力加强夏种
　　临湘路口公社荆竹大队有计划安排劳力抢栽抢插步步领先
    本报合肥14日电　中共安徽省舒城县委认真贯彻以农业为基础的方针，把一切可以调动的人力、物力投入农业生产，全县参加农业生产的人数占总劳力的82％。工、商、学、兵都围绕农业生产，开展各种为农业服务的活动。
    舒城县夏种已基本结束，种下的二十五万亩中稻和十八万亩旱粮正待管理；三十万亩早稻即将收刈；二十万亩双季晚稻正待栽插，相应而来的积肥任务也很大，目前正处于一年农事活动最紧张的关头。根据这种情况，舒城县委采取了县委包社、部门包社、公社书记、委员包大队和层层下放的“三包一放”的办法，加强农业生产的领导。
    为了集中主要力量搞好农业生产，仅最近几天已从县一级的厂、矿、城镇中抽出的非农业生产劳力就有一千三百多人，连同过去抽调出的共有四千五百多人，此外又从二万名水利工人中，抽出一万二千人投入了农业生产。全县十一个公社还从社办工业、生活福利和文教卫生方面抽出近一万人投入了夏种和田间管理。
    县委工交、财贸、文教卫生各部门，除尽可能抽调干部、职工下乡直接参加生产外，还在以农业为基础的思想指导下，来安排本部门各项工作。县农业机械厂决定暂停生产麻纺机、织布机，集中力量突击制造脱谷机和喷雾器。商业部门也开展以“三防”“双抢”准备为中心的活动，首先保证排灌机械用油的供应和镰刀、篾箩等各种农具的准备，并且把原来保持的经常送货下乡的人员三百四十多人增加到四百多人，开展登门收购，送货到劳动的地方和食堂。文教部门除继续派得力干部加强本部门所包公社的领导和组织学校师生、机关干部假日突击积肥送肥下乡外，还根据当前天气炎热的特点，组织县一级医院50％以上的医疗卫生人员，巡回田头医疗。
    县委特别强调了对后进地区的领导，如龙舒公社的四圩大队，麦种计划完成较差，已栽下的作物还有18％的三类苗，县委发现以后，立即从县、社两级干部中下放十一人充当大队或生产队干部，领导生产，并且固定一名公社党委书记常住大队进行具体领导，同时拨出一万元资金支援大队生产，决心帮助这个大队尽快地赶上先进队。
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南临湘县路口公社荆竹大队和石山大队在劳力安排上，采取了两种不同的方法，生产上出现了两种不同的结果。最近，石山大队学习了荆竹大队的经验后，妥善的安排劳力，早、中稻的田间管理已经赶了上来。
    荆竹大队由于全面安排劳力，集中精兵良将投入早、中稻田间管理，全队二千零五亩早稻禾苗长得一片青葱，基本上消灭了三类苗；中稻、杂粮和经济作物也普遍进行了追肥中耕，生长良好。夏播面积比去年扩大了24％，生猪存栏数比去年增长将近一倍，其他副业生产也有很大发展。
    荆竹大队全面安排劳力的主要经验是：第一，按农事季节忙闲合理摆布劳力。前些时候集中优势兵力取得了抢收春收作物和抢插早稻的胜利后，除安排60％的劳力，加强早稻田间管理和中稻、一季晚稻插秧外，立即抽调了16.6％的劳力，突击抢种了七百五十亩蔬菜，采集了九万多斤猪饲料，摘完了第二道春茶。最近，又抓住早、中稻增产的关键时期，安排了占总数77％的劳力大搞田间管理，其余的搞畜牧、水产、副业和生活福利。第二，千方百计挖掘劳动潜力。党总支采取“精、换、节、挤”等方法，把青壮劳力调到生产第一线。全大队就为生产第一线增加了一百九十四个青壮年劳力。第三，按农活特点和技术特长合理分工。第四，全面安排、分工协作，根据季节气候变化等特点，临时集中优势兵力，分清主次，组织分段分项突击，使生产任务按时按质完成。第五，保证社员每天有八小时睡眠，四小时休息时间，使社员精力充沛，生产效率大大提高。
    石山大队自然条件和劳力负担情况与荆竹大队一样，而生产上却一度出现了和荆竹大队不同的情况，经检查分析：主要原因是“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的思想不够明确，主观上虽然想项项工作都搞好，但由于在使用领导、干部力量和劳力方面，没有分清主次缓急，顾此失彼，结果工作一项也未抓好。比如当春收和早稻插秧进入紧张阶段时，大队只安排了60％的劳力上阵，因而推迟了早稻插秧季节，给夏季田间管理带来了繁重的任务。可是这个情况，还没有引起大队领导上的重视，劳力仍没有进行合理的调整，在农业主攻战线上只安排占总劳力52％的人力，其中青壮年也不多，结果早稻追肥中耕的进度很慢，三类苗较多，夏播计划也完成得不够好。
    石山大队以后学习了荆竹大队的经验，集中了占总劳力85％的社员，大干田间管理。
    截至6月25日止，全队三类苗已由30％下降到8％，一类苗占70％，其他各项工作也跟上来了。（附图片）
