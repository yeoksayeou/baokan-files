Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 9th (Reporter Shi Liming) - In order to adapt to the production and collective living needs of urban people's communes, Shenyang has implemented a new form of basic-level health and healthcare organization, with excellent results.

This form of health and healthcare organization involves unifying the institutions of the health and healthcare clinics, the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and the Red Cross under the leadership of the urban people's commune Party committee. It unifies the use of health and healthcare personnel and implements the principles of combining health and production, combining prevention and treatment, combining women's and children's healthcare, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and combining medical institutions and the masses. People call it the "three unifications and five combinations" health and healthcare organization.

This organizational form first appeared in the Hongqi People's Commune in the Dadong District of Shenyang and quickly spread to other communes. The city's original forty-one street health clinics have now developed into seventy-six commune-level health and healthcare clinics; commune district and neighborhood committee-level health and healthcare clinics have increased from seventy-five in November 1959 to three hundred and twenty-three. The commune's health and healthcare team has also increased from 344 people in the past to 2,710 people. Many people's communes have established environmental sanitation teams centered on health and healthcare clinics, established hygiene rooms in production workshops, and set up simple medicine chests in nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens, and residential compounds, and have universally established health workers. These health workers are also health and epidemic prevention workers, Red Cross health workers, health propagandists, and health supervisors. In this way, a mass health and healthcare network has been formed within the commune, basically ensuring that wherever there is production, wherever there is life, there is medicine and health.

The establishment of this basic-level health and healthcare organization has promoted the in-depth development of the eliminate pests and diseases campaign and has enabled the "prevention first" policy to be fully implemented. Professional health and healthcare personnel in each commune conduct comprehensive physical examinations of commune members according to the different periods, and at the same time, they rely on a large number of mass health workers to form a disease intelligence network. In this way, it is possible to achieve early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment, and to eliminate various infectious diseases in their early stages. Each commune also relies on health and healthcare organizations to assist production units in doing a good job in female workers' labor protection, universally establishing female workers' health rooms, implementing the "four-period labeling" method for menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, and adopting the "three-period transfer" measures of adjusting to dry instead of wet during menstruation, adjusting to light instead of heavy during pregnancy, and adjusting to near instead of far during breastfeeding. The hygiene work of the collective welfare undertakings of the commune members, especially the public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, has also been strengthened with inspections and guidance. The health and healthcare organizations of each commune have also run ninety-four health schools, providing more systematic training and education on health and healthcare knowledge to 22,724 health workers, cooks, and childcare workers who are closely related to production and the collective life of commune members. Relying on this group of key personnel and activists, they have extensively and deeply carried out large-scale publicity, popularization, and improvement of health knowledge, and cultivated commune members' conscious participation in the eliminate pests and diseases campaign. These have effectively controlled the occurrence and spread of various infectious diseases.

This basic-level health and healthcare organization enables health and healthcare work to better serve production and the masses. Since the health and healthcare network was established, factory workers can receive diagnosis and treatment at any time when they are sick, reducing the phenomenon of patients going to the hospital regardless of the severity of their condition, and greatly improving the attendance rate of employees. According to statistics from 157 commune-run factory health rooms, they provide medical treatment to workers anytime and anywhere, saving workers 5,343 work hours in less than two months. The health and healthcare organizations of many communes have launched "family sickbed" activities. Since the beginning of last winter, they have set up "family sickbeds" 7,776 times, achieving "doctors going to the door," "patients not going out," and "medicine delivered to the door," which not only reduced the chances of cross-infection of diseases but also changed the old habit of "doctors not knocking on the door" and "sitting in the hall to see patients."

Because the commune's mass health and healthcare work is done well, the number of outpatients in some large hospitals has decreased significantly. According to statistics from the Seventh District Health and Healthcare Clinic of the Hongqi People's Commune, more than 60% of the patients in its jurisdiction receive local medical treatment, with good results and satisfaction from the masses. After the First Hospital of the Shenhe District helped the factories in the commune establish health rooms, the number of outpatients decreased by 23.5% in less than two months. In the fight against measles in Dadong, Shenhe, Heping, and other five districts, the combination of professional medical personnel and the strength of the masses enabled the situation of more than 130,000 measles-susceptible children to be investigated in just a few days, and comprehensive preventive medication was carried out, greatly improving the efficiency of prevention and treatment.

### 适应城市公社生产需要　更好地为社员健康服务  沈阳建立新型卫生保健组织

    适应城市公社生产需要　更好地为社员健康服务
    沈阳建立新型卫生保健组织
    新华社沈阳9日电　记者史立明报道：沈阳市为了适应城市人民公社生产和社员集体生活的需要，实行了一种新的基层卫生保健组织形式，效果很好。
    这种卫生保健组织形式，就是在城市人民公社党委的领导下，把卫生保健所、爱国卫生运动委员会、红十字会的机构统一起来，统一使用卫生保健人员，实行卫生和生产相结合，预防和治疗相结合，妇女卫生保健和儿童卫生保健相结合，中西医药相结合，医疗机构和群众相结合的原则。人们把它称作“三统一、五结合”的卫生保健组织。
    这种组织形式，首先在沈阳市大东区红旗人民公社出现，很快在各公社推广开来。全市原有的四十一个街道卫生所，目前已发展成为人民公社一级的卫生保健所七十六处；公社分区和居民委员会一级的卫生保健所由1959年11月份的七十五处，发展到三百二十三处。公社的卫生保健队伍也由过去的三百四十四人，增加到二千七百一十人。许多人民公社都以卫生保健所为中心，建立环境卫生保洁队，在生产车间建立卫生室，在托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂、居民大院里设立简易药箱，普遍地设立保健员。这些保健员同时又是卫生防疫员、红十字会卫生员、卫生宣传员、卫生监督员。这样，就在公社范围内形成群众性卫生保健网，基本上做到那里有生产、那里有生活，那里就有医药卫生。
    这种基层卫生保健组织的建立，推动了除害灭病运动的深入开展，并且使“预防为主”的方针得到全面贯彻。各公社专业卫生保健人员按照各个时期，对社员群众进行身体健康大检查，同时依靠大批群众卫生保健员组成疾病情报网。这样，就能做到早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗，把各种传染病消灭在发病初期。各公社还依靠卫生保健组织协助生产单位做好女工劳动保护工作，普遍地建立女工卫生室，实行经期、孕期、娩期、哺乳期的“四期挂牌”办法，采取经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远的“三期调转”的措施。对社员集体福利事业，特别是公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作，也加强了检查和指导。各公社的卫生保健组织还举办了九十四处卫生学校，对二万二千七百二十四名同生产、社员集体生活有密切关系的保健员、炊事员、保育员进行了较系统的卫生保健知识的训练和教育，依靠这批骨干和积极分子，广泛深入地开展卫生知识的大宣传、大普及、大提高，培养社员群众自觉地投入除害灭病运动。这些，都有效地控制了各种传染疾病的发生和蔓延。
    这种基层卫生保健组织，使卫生保健工作更好地为生产、为群众服务。自从卫生保健网建成后，工厂工人有病随时可以得到诊治，减少了患者不管病情轻重都跑医院的现象，大大提高了职工的出勤率。根据一百五十七个社办工厂保健室的统计，它们随时随地为工人看病，不到二个月就为工人们节约了五千三百四十三个工时。许多公社的卫生保健组织开展了“家庭病床”活动，从去年入冬以来，已经设立过“家庭病床”七千七百七十六张次，做到“医生走出门”，“患者不出门”，“医药送上门”，不仅减少了疾病互相交叉感染的机会，也改变了“医不叩门”，“坐堂看病”的旧习惯。
    由于公社群众性卫生保健工作做得好，就使得一些大医院的门诊量显著下降。据红旗人民公社第七分区卫生保健所的统计，在所属范围内的患者，有60％以上都是就地医疗，效果良好，群众满意；沈河区第一医院帮助公社各工厂建立起保健室以后，不到两个月，门诊量就下降了23.5％。大东、沈河、和平等五个区在同麻疹作斗争中，专业医务人员和群众力量相结合，在短短几天就将十三万多名麻疹易感儿童的情况全部调查清楚，进行了综合性预防投药，大大提高了防治效率。
