According to a Reuters report on the 12th, three people were killed and twelve injured in this operation.

In the aforementioned three cities, orders have been issued to prohibit marches, demonstrations, and gatherings. In Jorhat, a 24-hour curfew has also been imposed. The Assam government has also declared that the area five miles on either side of the railway line in the state will be designated as a "disturbed area" for three months.

According to the Press Trust of India, Defense Minister Menon and Congress Party President Reddy went to Assam on July 10th to investigate the serious situation caused by language disputes there. They discussed with the Assam Governor and Finance Minister the measures to be taken "to restore law and order in the state."

The movement to make Assamese the state language has been going on for a long time. This movement has been opposed by a portion of Assam residents, mainly those who speak Bengali. The situation became tense after police in Gauhati shot and killed a student and injured seven others on the 4th.

　　印度派兵镇压阿萨姆邦动乱
　　阿萨姆邦语言纠纷中已有六人被警察枪杀
    新华社13日讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度陆军和阿萨姆邦的步兵11日被调往阿萨姆邦，去帮助这个邦的民政当局镇压乔哈特、西布萨加尔和戈拉加特等地由于语言纠纷所引起的动乱。
    据路透社12日报道，在这次行动中有三人被打死，十二人受伤。
    在上述三个城市中，已经下令禁止游行、示威和集会。在乔哈特，还实行了二十四小时的戒严。阿萨姆邦政府还宣布，这个邦铁路沿线两侧五英里的地区在三个月内为“不安定的地区”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，7月10日国防部长梅农和国大党主席雷迪曾经到阿萨姆邦去调查那里由于语言纠纷所引起的严重局势。他们和阿萨姆邦邦长、财政部长讨论了要采取的措施“来恢复这个邦的治安”。
    把阿萨姆语成为邦语的鼓动运动，已经进行了很久。这个运动遭到阿萨姆邦一部分居民、主要是讲孟加拉语居民的反对。自从警察4日在高哈蒂开枪打死一名学生和打伤七人的事件发生后，局势变得紧张起来。
    据“印度时报”说，在这个语言纠纷中，仅仅被警察开枪打死的就有六人。
