    Qinghai
    (Our Dispatch) Qinghai Province is resolutely implementing crucial measures such as weeding, topdressing, and disaster prevention to promote high yields of spring-sown crops. Zhu Xiafu, Chen Sigong, Tan Shengbin, and Xue Hongfu, secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, and Ji Chunguang, Zhang Junxian, and Yu Guang, members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, have recently led large numbers of cadres to the fields; prefectures and counties have generally transferred more than 80% of their cadres to the forefront to strengthen late-stage field management.
    Qinghai Province opened up large tracts of wasteland last winter and this spring, and the sown area has doubled compared to last year. Now is the critical moment for the growth of various crops. In the high tide of strengthening late-stage field management, many regions have put forward specific targets, requiring that late-stage management promote an increase of ten, twenty, or even thirty jin per mu. Datong County is launching a mass movement to strive for an increase of twenty jin per mu. The County Party Committee has organized fourteen work groups to strengthen leadership in backward teams. Communes have successively held mobilization rallies, mobilizing all agricultural labor to focus on three grasps (grasping irrigation, grasping topdressing, grasping weeding) and five preventions (preventing hail, floods, insects, drought, lodging), attacking key links for increasing production. The county strives to increase grain production by 20 million jin on top of the originally planned output. In Hualong Hui Autonomous County, the beginnings of diseases and insect pests were discovered. Four thousand cadres at all levels in the county, leading more than 25,000 laborers, contracted specific areas and fought in the fields to wipe out the newly emerging wheat rust and rice thrips.
    In late-stage field management, various regions also pay attention to grasping key fields and key measures. In Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, cadres at five levels joined forces in the fields, concentrating 90% of the labor force to attack high-yield fields and third-class fields for various crops. Key fields are given priority for weeding, application of fertilizer, and irrigation. After more than ten days of concentrated efforts, high-yield fields have been raised to a higher level, and more than half of the original third-class fields have been upgraded.
    The transition from summer to autumn is a season when mountainous areas in Qinghai Province are prone to natural disasters such as hail and frost. Counties and communes with more mountainous areas have generally established hail and frost prevention headquarters and carried out joint prevention work between counties and communes to ensure a good harvest.
    Yunnan
    (Our Dispatch) The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor," mobilized the whole party and the whole people to concentrate efforts on agricultural production.
    In order to do a good job in agricultural production, the Provincial Party Committee required all localities to earnestly implement the party's distribution policies; while grasping production, earnestly do a good job in the masses' lives, and further establish a good work style of being both energetic and down-to-earth among cadres at all levels. At present, Party committees at all levels are taking a direct approach to rapidly and timely disseminate the Party's policies to the masses; many leading cadres have directly gone to the grassroots cadres and masses to implement policies, understand the masses' thoughts, and solve specific problems. The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee recently held a five-level cadre meeting, where the Provincial Party Committee's several regulations on grain contracted production, pig raising, vegetable planting, and commune members' wage policies were directly explained to grassroots cadres and activists. After returning, cadres at all levels immediately convened branch committee meetings, cadre and poor peasant/lower-middle peasant/old peasant meetings, and commune member meetings to explain the policies to the masses. The masses happily called these policies the "Four Major Goals." After implementing the Provincial Party Committee's policies, many communes in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture immediately concentrated 80% of their labor force to engage in mid-cultivation and summer hoeing, launching a mass movement to exceed contracted production. After publicizing the policies in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the labor force engaged in mid-cultivation and summer hoeing increased from about 65% to about 75% in a short period of time. At present, rice and corn in the prefecture have been hoeed for the first time, and more than 1.3 million mu have been hoeed for the second time.
    In order to ensure that more labor is engaged in agricultural production, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee decided that in the future, all systems of industry, finance, and trade must strictly implement the national labor plan, no longer transfer labor from the countryside, and save as much labor as possible to return to the countryside. The industrial sector must actively produce inexpensive and high-quality agricultural machinery to promote the development of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization. The province's prefectural, county, and commune-run industries must serve the needs of agricultural production in the future. In order to further invigorate the rural economy and increase the income of communes and members, financial and trade departments must in the future use their main force to guide production and organize production so that rural areas can better develop sideline production and diversified operations, ensuring the needs of agricultural production development.
    Hebei
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th) People's communes in Hebei Province are seizing the key period of July, August, and September, launching an overproduction competition centered on field management, and striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn.
    Concentrating superior forces to vigorously grasp mid-cultivation, weeding, topdressing, watering, and pest control, doing everything possible to promote the development of various crops, striving for early heading, early tuber formation, early budding, and early pod formation, and achieving comprehensive production increase are the main measures taken by various regions in field management. The Renqiu County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on this year's drought, inconsistent rice planting times, and different rice seedling growth conditions, put forward the slogan of "seizing time, grasping key points, planting well and managing well, ensuring a bumper harvest of rice," leading communes and production teams to vigorously promote late rice catching up with early rice, early Dian rice catching up with paddy rice, second and third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, and ordinary fields catching up with high-yield fields. In just ten days, the county accumulated more than 200 million jin of fertilizer for rice fields, topdressed 100,000 mu, and weeded and harrowed 160,000 mu, making most rice seedlings grow vigorously. In order to seize the time to eliminate barren seedlings, various regions have concentrated their forces to launch surprise battles. Qian'an County adopted the method of all sectors of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military mobilizing together in eliminating barren land. Communes in the county dispatched a total of more than 7,200 weeding hoes and 3,200 harrows, making it possible to universally hoe the county's 410,000 mu of field crops once.
    Resolutely grasping high-yield and bumper harvest fields and carrying out a "thousand, hundred, ten thousand" large-area bumper harvest movement is another strategic measure adopted by various regions to win an autumn harvest and achieve overproduction plans under this year's severe drought conditions. The province has a total of 40 million mu of high-yield and bumper harvest fields. In order to ensure that these high-yield fields achieve high yields in every block, various regions have generally adopted measures in field management such as setting yields according to plots, setting measures according to yields, establishing a responsibility system, fixing labor, and implementing the "four concentrations" of labor, water sources, fertilizers, and tools.
    In order to make various crops follow the example of high-yield fields and strive for balanced production increases, various regions have strengthened the management of weak seedlings and third-class seedlings in field management, and promoted the upgrading of third-class seedlings through adding water and fertilizer and careful management. Huailai County adopted the method of simultaneously carrying out mid-cultivation, topdressing, and watering, and vigorously promoted the comprehensive upgrading of various crops. After a period of meticulous management, the proportion of first and second-class seedlings in the county increased from 89.7% in late June to 95%; the proportion of third-class seedlings decreased from 10.3% to 5%.
    Guangxi
    (Our Dispatch) The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region mobilized the whole party and the whole people to fight a key month battle, ensuring the good harvesting, management, and planting of early, mid-season, and late-season crops.
    From mid-July to mid-August is a crucial month for striving for a full-year harvest. At present, the people of the entire region are in high spirits and have held meetings to pledge to harvest, manage, and plant early, mid-season, and late-season crops well.
    Tight deadlines, large workloads, and insufficient labor are the main contradictions in current agricultural production. In order to fight a beautiful battle in summer harvesting and planting and win the initiative in overall work, various regions have taken various measures to compress the rear and streamline institutions, enhance the labor force on the agricultural front, and ensure the concentration of 80% of the labor force in field production. Within a few days, the Wuzhou Prefecture adjusted more than 60,000 laborers from the rear and sent them to the forefront of agricultural production. In Yulin Prefecture, 82.3% of the labor force has been put into the "double rush" movement. In Luchuan County, the labor force concentrated in field production is as high as 87.5%, greatly accelerating the progress of harvesting and planting. The summer harvesting and planting work team composed of 60,000 cadres in the entire autonomous region has gone deep into the production teams to strengthen the leadership of grassroots organizations. All people's communes in Guilin Prefecture moved their offices and telephones to the forefront of production, participating in production and directing production.
    Carrying out a high-efficiency movement centered on the reform of summer harvesting and planting tools is a prominent feature of the current agricultural production campaign. Through a large-scale mass movement, the entire autonomous region has manufactured batches of rice transplanters, harvesters, threshers, transport vehicles, and small iron and wooden farm tools. There are more than 330,000 rice transplanters alone, almost double the number during spring planting. In Nanning Prefecture, more than 55% of the 3.2 million mu of late rice will be transplanted with rice transplanters. In Rong County, the average number of threshing machines per production team of 3,500 is 2.2, 4.7 harvesters, and one rice transplanter; every three laborers have a vehicle, and every three cows have a new plow and harrow, so the progress of summer harvesting and planting has accelerated exponentially.

    大战八、九月  抓秋田管理  争高产多收
    青海负责干部到第一线加强领导  云南认真贯彻政策掀起超产运动
    河北狠抓中耕追肥促进作物生长  广西保证早中晚稻收好管好种好
    青海
    本报讯　青海省狠抓锄草、追肥、防灾等关键措施，促使春播作物高产。省委书记朱侠夫、陈思恭、谭生彬、薛宏福，省委常委冀春光、张俊贤、余光等同志最近分别率领大批干部深入田间；各州、县普遍抽调80％以上的干部上第一线，加强后期田间管理。
    青海省去冬今春大开荒地，播种面积比去年扩大一倍。当前正是各类作物生长的关键时刻，在加强后期田间管理的高潮中，许多地区提出具体指标，要求通过后期管理促使每亩超产十斤、二十斤甚至三十斤。大通县正在开展一个争取每亩超产二十斤的群众运动，县委组织了十四个工作组分别到各后进队加强领导，各公社先后召开了誓师大会，动员所有农业劳力以三抓（抓浇水、抓追肥、抓锄草）、五防（防雹、洪、虫、旱、倒伏）为中心，猛攻关键性增产环节，全县争取在原订产量的基础上再增产粮食两千万斤。化隆回族自治县发现病害虫害开始露头，全县四千名各级干部，率领两万五千多名劳力分片包干，奋战田间，一鼓作气歼灭了刚刚露头的麦锈病和吸浆虫等病虫害。
    各地在后期田间管理中，还注意抓重点田和抓关键措施。门源回族自治县五级干部会师田间，集中了90％的劳力，猛攻各类作物的丰产方和三类田，给重点田优先除草、施偏肥、浇偏水，经过十多天突击，丰产方更上一层楼，原来的三类田有一半以上升了级。
    夏秋之交是青海省山区发生冰雹、霜冻等自然灾害较多的季节，山地较多的县和公社普遍设立了防雹防霜指挥所，开展了县与县、社与社的联防工作，确保丰收果实。
    云南
    本报讯　中共云南省委根据“以农业为基础，以工业为主导”的思想，动员全党全民，集中力量大抓农业生产。
    为了搞好农业生产，省委要求各地认真贯彻执行党的分配政策；在抓好生产的同时，认真搞好群众生活，并在各级干部中进一步树立既干劲十足、又踏踏实实的优良作风。目前，各级党委正采取一竿子到底的办法，把党的政策迅速及时地传播到群众中去；许多领导干部已直接到基层干部和群众中去贯彻政策，了解群众思想，解决具体问题。大理白族自治州州委最近召开了五级干部会议，将省委关于粮食包产、养猪、种菜和社员工资政策的几项规定，直接向基层干部和积极分子交代清楚。各级干部回去后，也都立即召开支委会、干部和贫农、下中农、老农会议和社员大会，向群众说明政策，群众高高兴兴把这些政策称为“四大目标”。大理白族自治州贯彻省委的政策后，许多公社立即集中80％劳动力投入中耕夏锄，掀起了超包产的群众运动。德宏傣族景颇族自治州宣传政策后，投入中耕夏锄的劳动力，在短期之内就由65％上升到75％左右，现在全州水稻和玉米都已薅完头道，并有一百三十多万亩薅了二道草。
    为了保证更多的劳动力从事农业生产，云南省委决定：今后工业、财贸等各个系统必须一律严格执行国家劳动计划，不再从农村抽调劳动力，并尽可能地节约出劳动力回农村去。工业部门要积极生产物美价廉的农业机械，以推动农业机械化、半机械化的发展。全省的专、县工业与社办工业，今后必须围绕农业生产的需要服务。为了进一步活跃农村经济，增加公社和社员的收入，财贸部门今后必须以自己的主要力量用于指导生产和组织生产，以便农村更好地开展副业生产和多种经营，保证农业生产发展的需要。
    河北
    据新华社天津28日电　河北省各地人民公社抓住7、8、9三个月的关键时期，掀起了以田间管理为中心的超产竞赛运动，力争秋季全面大丰收。
    集中优势力量狠抓中耕、锄草、追肥、浇水、除虫，千方百计促进各种作物的发育，力争早结穗、早结块、早现蕾、早结荚，实现全面增产，是各地在田间管理中采取的主要措施。中共任丘县委根据今年干旱、水稻播种时间早晚不一致、稻苗生长情况不同的情况，提出了“抢时间、抓关键，插好管好，保证水稻大丰收”的口号，领导各公社、生产队大搞晚稻赶早稻、早淀稻赶水稻，二三类苗赶一类苗，一般田赶丰产田的竞赛，仅十天时间，全县就为稻田积肥两亿多斤，并追肥十万亩，拔草挠秧十六万亩，使大部分稻苗生长茁壮。为了争取时间消灭荒苗，各地都集中力量大搞突击战役。迁安县在灭荒中，采取工农商学兵齐出动的办法，全县各公社共出动七千二百多架耘锄，三千二百架耠子，使全县四十一万亩大田作物普锄一遍。
    狠抓高产丰收田，开展“千、百、万”大面积丰产运动，这是各地在今年严重干旱情况下，夺取秋季丰收、实现超产计划的另一战略措施。全省共有四千万亩高产丰收田，为了保证这些高产田方方块块保高产，各地在田间管理上普遍采取了按地块定产量，按产量定措施，建立责任制，固定劳力，并实行劳力、水源、肥料、工具“四集中”的办法。
    为了使各种作物都向高产田看齐，力争达到平衡增产，各地在田间管理中，都加强了对弱苗和三类苗的管理，通过加水加肥和仔细管理等来促进三类苗升级。怀来县采取中耕、追肥、浇水一齐上的办法，大搞各种作物全面升级，经过一段精细管理，全县一、二类苗由6月下旬的89.7％增到95％；三类苗由10.3％减少到5％。
    广西
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区全党全民总动员，大战关键月，保证做好早、中、晚造作物的收、管、种工作。
    从7月中旬到8月中旬是争取全年丰收的关键月。目前，全区人民意气风发，纷纷集会誓师，誓把早、中、晚三造收好、管好、种好。
    季节紧迫，工作量大和劳动力不足是当前农业生产的主要矛盾。为了在夏收夏种中打一个漂亮仗，赢得全盘工作的主动，各地采取各种办法，压缩后方，精简机构，增强农业战线的劳动力，保证集中80％的劳动力，投入田间生产。梧州专区几天之内，就从后方调整出六万多劳动力，开赴农业生产第一线。玉林专区已有82.3％的劳动力投入了“双抢”运动。陆川县集中到田间生产的劳动力高达87.5％，大大加快了收种进度。全自治区由六万名干部组成的夏收夏种工作团，已分别深入生产队，加强了基层组织的领导力量。桂林专区所有人民公社都把办公室、电话机搬到生产最前线，参加生产，指挥生产。
    开展以夏收夏种工具改革为中心的高工效运动，是当前农业生产大会战的突出特点，经过大搞群众运动，全自治区已制造出成批的插秧机、收割器、脱粒机、运输车子和铁木小农具。仅插秧机就达三十三万多架，比春插时几乎增加一倍。南宁专区三百二十万亩晚稻，有55％以上的面积将用插秧机插秧。容县三千五百多个生产小队，平均每队有打谷机二点二架、收割器四点七架、插秧机一架，每三个劳动力有一架车子，每三头牛有一架新式犁耙，因此夏收夏种进度成倍加快。
