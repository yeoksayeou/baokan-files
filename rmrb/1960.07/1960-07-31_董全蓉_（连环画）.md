    Seven. In order to welcome the bumper harvest of 1960, their production team surveyed all the fields and identified three backward slopes, five backward ranks, and a total of one hundred mu of low-yield fields.

    六、董全蓉坚决贯彻阶级路线，她和本队干部商量后给这个小队预支了一些钱，又办起食堂、托儿所，帮助了贫雇农。刘六姐和程元顺都当了干部。
    七、为了迎接一九六○年的大丰收，他们的生产队把所有的田地进行了排队摸底，结果查出了三个落后冲，五个落后榜，低产田共百亩。
    八、在改造低产田中，遭到一些富裕中农和少数有保守思想的人的反对。在他们看来，一切只有按老习惯办事，听任大自然摆布。
    九、董全蓉紧紧依靠贫农积极分子，去和他们研究。贫农都赞成，有的说：“山大、冲大、水大，没有咱们的力量大！”（一续）
