　　Twist into a Single Rope, First Satisfy the Needs of Agricultural Production
　　Wang Guadian Commune Concentrates Manpower, Material Resources, and Financial Resources to Strengthen Autumn Field Management
　　This newspaper reports that the Wang Guadian Commune Party Committee in Feicheng County, Shandong Province, has conscientiously implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for the past two years, achieving great leaps forward in agricultural production year after year and all-around success in various tasks. Now, it has concentrated all the manpower, material resources, and financial resources that can be concentrated in the entire commune, and mobilized the strength of all sectors, including industry, commerce, transportation, culture, education, and health, to vigorously manage autumn fields. The entire commune's overproduction competition has been widely launched. The first secretary of the commune's Party committee, leading all cadres, is determined to work hard in the fields for three months, vowing not to retreat until a bumper harvest is secured. The Party committee secretary and members use five high-yield plots as bases, commanding five areas separately, with general commune cadres assigned to teams, team cadres assigned to groups, and all cadres responsible for management, output, and ideological mobilization, taking full responsibility. More than 13,000 men and women in the entire commune, representing half of the labor force, have been concentrated, with over 80% engaged in field labor. Recently, measures such as squeezing, participating, drawing, replacing, stopping, and slowing down have been adopted to mobilize more than 2,000 cadres, workers, rural auxiliary labor, and more than 6,000 students to participate in weeding, replanting seedlings, and applying fertilizer. Based on the spirit of ensuring key areas and taking care of the overall situation, the commune Party committee has readjusted the economic expenditure plan, concentrating all funds to first ensure the needs of summer production and using the money where it matters most. Originally, the summer production fund totaled more than 180,000 yuan. Now, the capital construction investment for health undertakings is postponed until after the autumn harvest, non-productive expenditures such as administrative expenses are reduced to the minimum, and potential is tapped from other non-urgent projects to raise 500,000 yuan in funds, appropriately meeting the needs of autumn field crops in terms of fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, agricultural tools, and pig raising. The industrial sector is also centered on supporting autumn field management, launching competition between factories, groups, and individuals. Workers are rushing to produce cultivation and weeding tools, fertilizer transport vehicles, and cooking utensils, and producing local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides, striving to produce 3,200 summer hoeing tools and improve 1,500 small hoes, and 700 fertilizer application vehicles in the shortest possible time. The commercial sector has dispatched 32 employees to go deep into the major brigades and reside in the high-yield plots, rushing to transport prepared machine parts, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers to the fields.
　　Since last spring, the Wang Guadian Commune has concentrated its leadership on strengthening the agricultural front line. In terms of labor arrangement, priority is given to ensuring that the labor force on the agricultural front line is met, and appropriate consideration is given to the overall situation. The entire commune has 13,000 laborers, and this spring, more than 70% of the labor force was arranged for field management, 20% for farmland capital construction, and 10% for industrial and sideline production and the development of diversified economy. Even the labor force used for capital construction is used for projects that benefit the current year. The newly built reservoirs and wells have played a role in drought resistance and wheat protection, and drought resistance and summer planting. Therefore, the entire commune's 47,000 mu of wheat, whether in mountainous or plain areas, has basically achieved five waterings and three fertilizations. Under severe drought conditions, the yield per mu increased by 15.3%, and the total output increased by 36.7%.
　　The financial departments here actively organize and guarantee the funds needed for agricultural development, expanding production investment. The tax departments have also changed the practice of simply collecting taxes, first using 90% of their efforts to help the masses develop production, and then collecting taxes. Other cultural, educational, and health departments are all under the unified leadership of the Party committee, facing production and fully supporting agriculture.
　　The result of the entire party and the entire people twisting into a single rope to strengthen agricultural production is that agricultural production has achieved continuous great leaps forward under severe drought conditions. This commune suffered a severe drought for 47 days in 1959, and the average grain yield per mu reached 550 jin, an increase of 44.7% compared with the great leap forward year of 1958. In the first half of this year, on the basis of continuous severe drought, another bumper summer harvest was won.
　　In implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, this commune also firmly grasps taking grain as the key link, comprehensively arranging agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, achieving prosperity in all five industries, and providing more material strength for agriculture. In 1959, taking advantage of the gaps in the production movement, five mass-based efforts were organized to engage in sideline occupations and small commodity production, with a total income of 1.36 million yuan. This spring, after the spring sowing ended and before the summer harvest arrived, a certain amount of labor and tools were extracted to engage in a period of sideline production, with an income of 240,000 yuan, which solved the problem of insufficient summer production funds and wage distribution, and did not delay the summer harvest sowing. Arrangements have now been made to organize another mass-based sideline production movement before the autumn harvest, and arrangements have been made for the raw materials needed for sideline occupations and small commodity production in winter and next spring.

　　拧成一股劲，首先满足农业生产的需要
　　王瓜店公社集中人力物力财力加强秋田管理
    本报讯　山东肥城县王瓜店公社党委，两年来认真贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，农业生产连年大跃进，各项工作样样满堂红。现在又集中了全社一切可以集中的人力物力财力，调动起工商交通文教卫生等各行各业的力量狠抓秋田管理。全社超产竞赛已经普遍开展起来了。公社党委第一书记带领全体干部决心在田间苦干三个月，不夺丰收誓不收兵。党委书记和党委委员以五个丰产方为基地，分头指挥五片，一般社干部分方包队，队干部分组划块，所有干部包管理，包产量，包思想发动，一包到底。全社男女整半劳动一万三千多人，已集中80％以上从事田间劳动，最近又采取挤、参、抽、换、停、缓等办法，调集两千余名干部、职工、农村辅助劳力和六千多名学生，参加锄草、补苗和追肥工作。公社党委本着保证重点照顾全面的精神，重新调整了经济开支计划，集中一切资金，首先保证夏季生产需要，把钱用在“刀刃”上。原来夏季生产资金共有十八万多元，现在将卫生事业基建投资推迟到秋后拨款，把行政费用等非生产性支出压缩到最低限度，并从其他非当前之急的项目中挖掘潜力，筹集到资金五十万元、适当满足了秋田作物肥料、农药、机械、农具、养猪等方面的需要。工业部门也以支援秋田管理为中心，掀起厂与厂、组与组、人与人之间的竞赛。工人们突击赶制中耕锄草器、运肥车、炊事用具，生产土化肥、土农药，力争在最短的时间内，制成夏锄工具三千二百件，改良小锄一千五百件，追肥车七百多个。商业部门抽出三十二名职工深入各大队住到丰产方，把准备好的机具零件、农药、化肥赶运到田间。
    王瓜店公社从去春以来，领导力量都集中加强农业第一线。在劳力安排上，首先保证满足农业生产第一线的劳力，适当的照顾全面。全社共有劳力一万三千名，今年春季安排以70％以上的劳力放在田间管理方面，20％用于农田基本建设，10％用于工、副业生产和发展多种经济。就是用于基本建设的劳力，也尽先用于当年受益的项目。新修的水库水井都在抗旱保麦、抗旱夏播中发挥了作用。所以全社四万七千亩小麦，无论山区或平原基本达到了五水三肥，在大旱的情况下，单产增长15.3％，总产增长36.7％。
    这里的财政金融部门，则积极组织和保证发展农业所需要的资金，扩大生产投资。税务部门也改变了单纯收税的作法，首先以90％的力量帮助群众发展生产，而后收税。其他文教卫生部门，都在党委统一领导下，面向生产，全力支援农业。
    全党全民拧成一股劲加强农业生产的结果，使农业生产在严重干旱的情况下，获得连续大跃进。这个社在1959年又遭受伏天大旱四十七天，而粮食平均亩产达到五百五十斤，比大跃进的1958年增产44.7％。今年上半年在连续大旱的基础上，又夺取了夏季大丰收。
    这个社在贯彻以农业为基础的方针上，还紧紧掌握以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔全面安排，达到五业俱兴，为农业提供更多的物质力量。1959年一年中，借生产运动空隙，组织了五次群众性的大搞副业、小商品生产，共收入资金一百三十六万元。今春在春播结束夏收未到之际抽出一定劳力、工具，大搞了一阵副业生产，收入二十四万元，解决了夏季生产资金不足和发放工资的问题，还不误夏收播种。现在又作好安排，准备秋收前再组织一次群众性的副业生产运动，并为冬季和明春副业、小商品生产所需要的原料作了安排。
