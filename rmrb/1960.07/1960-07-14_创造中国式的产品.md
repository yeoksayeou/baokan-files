　　Creating Chinese-Style Products
　　Yu Zhida, Youth Worker of Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory
    A high-grade precision six-use high-temperature calibrator was born in our Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory. Thus, my ideal of "breaking out of the imitation circle and creating first-class Chinese-style instruments" has been realized with the support of the Party and the help of the masses. After this product is put into production, one person can do the work of three, one portion of material can be used for four, and one product can do the work of six.
    The fact of creating a single multi-purpose high-temperature calibrator has made me deeply realize that as long as we listen to the Party, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and add our own unremitting efforts, we workers can become all-powerful people, and no difficulties can stop our path forward.

          A New Battle
    I was originally a communications soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. When I was demobilized and returned to China from Korea in May 1957, the leaders of the troops taught us before we parted: "We defeated American imperialism on the Korean battlefield. Now that you are demobilized, you must compete with imperialism again in the new post of building socialism." I kept the teachings of the troop leaders firmly in mind and came to the Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory.
    When I entered the Kepei Factory, there were only seventeen workers in the factory, but they were producing the eyes of modern machines—instruments. At that time, our factory's products were all imitated from foreign instrument styles, copying them in a mechanical way. This kind of imitation product takes a lot of time and materials to make, and it is clumsy and delicate to use, just like the American soldiers on the Korean battlefield! Once, a purchasing agent from Hangzhou bought an instrument and took it on a public bus. Before the bus had gone one stop, the galvanometer on the instrument was broken by the vibration. When the purchasing agent ran back to the factory to question us, I felt really uncomfortable. The workers in the factory all felt the same as me, and they got angry when they looked at these "master instruments." Everyone said: "We want to produce a brand-new instrument."

          For More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    To defeat the enemy, we must first refine our "shooting skills." From then on, I worked hard to study and explore the manufacturing principles of instruments. Every morning, I would go to work earlier and use the spare time to look at each part, from one component to another, and from one line to another, carefully. When I encountered problems I didn't understand, I wrote them down and asked the master workers and technicians for advice whenever I had time. When I was waiting for the bus at the station, I would also take it out and ponder it. Over time, after seeing more, I slowly discovered that there were many unreasonable aspects to this foreign model of instrument. I thought, this wastes both materials and man-hours. If we don't revolutionize it, we won't be able to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. At this time, some people also said:
  "People's foreign goods have been finalized for decades. If they could be changed, they would have been changed long ago. I'm afraid they can't be changed!" I thought: We Chinese people must have the ambition of Chinese people. Can we only walk in the footsteps of foreigners for the rest of our lives? If they stop and don't move, we will follow them and not move. When will we be able to catch up with and surpass them? No! We should blaze our own path and get ahead of imperialism. No matter what is finalized or not finalized, if it can be finalized, it can be changed. Everything is done by people!
    Just then, the Party gave me support. The secretary of the factory branch said to me:
  "Little Yu, you are right! If foreign goods do not meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results, we must revolutionize them! Create our Chinese-style instruments!" The words of the Party branch secretary gave me great encouragement, and I felt full of energy and confidence. From then on, every time I connected a line, every time I drilled a hole, I would think about whether it was useful, whether it could be revolutionized, and whether it could be replaced. The revolution of imitation products began in this way.

          Breaking Out of the Imitation Circle
    The revolution of imitation products has begun, but it is impossible to revolutionize all of them at once, so I will break them down one by one. Today, I will improve a part, tomorrow I will remove a screw, and the day after tomorrow I will compress a few lines. I will cut it a little every day, revolutionize it a little, and constantly revolutionize it. The more I revolutionize it, the more I have a way, and the more I revolutionize it, the more confident I am. The switch lines on the high-temperature calibrator have been reduced from thirty-six to nineteen. Every time it is revolutionized, the instrument takes a step towards more, faster, better, and more economical results; every time it is revolutionized, the instrument takes a step closer to "Chinese-style." There is a foreign-style electric bridge. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades, after thirteen revolutions, its parts have been reduced from sixty-five to thirty-two, and it has finally been reborn and transformed into a "Chinese-style" pocket electric bridge.
    The successive victories in the reform of products have further encouraged my determination to break out of the circle and design on my own. One day, I walked past the office and accidentally saw a purchase contract signed by Nanjing Yongli Chemical Plant and our factory, which stated that they needed high-temperature calibrators with different specifications of 400 degrees, 800 degrees, 1200 degrees, and 1600 degrees. At that time, I thought: Why can't one instrument combine its four or five functions? This can save so much material and shorten so many man-hours! Isn't the Municipal Party Committee calling on us to "increase production without increasing manpower"? Why can't we create instruments that save labor and materials and are single-use and multi-purpose? Once the idea was settled, I started looking for information. However, this kind of instrument does not exist in the world. I ran all over large and small bookstores and libraries, but I couldn't find any information. There was only one way out: explore and create on my own. I was thinking about this problem all the time, while eating, walking, during the day, and at night. The small notebook I carried with me was full of many circuit diagrams drawn in a chaotic way, but I still couldn't find a way. The Party branch knew that I had encountered difficulties and specially convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" of various workshops and groups. Many master workers came to help me with ideas. After a week of hard work, the first circuit diagram was finally created.
    Having a draft is only the first step. In the actual manufacturing and testing process, I also encountered a series of technical problems. The first time it was installed, after calibration, the galvanometer pointer did not move at all. When I disassembled it, I found that the upper and lower resistors were not aligned; the second time it was installed, after calibration, the pointer fell to one side again, so I had to disassemble it again; the third time, I connected a wrong line; the fourth time... Every time I failed, I recorded the situation of the failure. When I was a little discouraged, the Shanghai Changning District Committee of the Communist Youth League was holding a youth activist meeting, and the meeting introduced the story of Comrade Wang Linhe, who finally made a high-voltage electric bridge after 371 experiments. At that time, I was very moved, thinking: I have only failed hundreds of times, and I must not bow my head to difficulties! I want to learn from Wang Linhe, work hard, and work harder!

          Persistence is Victory
    One late night, I was staring blankly at the parts on the workbench alone. It had been more than half a month of hard work, and I had failed 130 times, but there was still no clue. Just when I felt anxious and uncomfortable, suddenly, a warm hand patted my shoulder, and I heard a kind voice: "Little Yu, how is it? Are you almost done?" It turned out that the Party branch secretary had come to the workshop again. When the Party branch secretary saw my spirit, he said to me seriously and earnestly, "Little Yu, you must persevere. Fearing difficulties is like surrendering to the enemy on the battlefield!" The Party branch secretary's words touched my heart all at once. Yes! Am I just going to lose like this? No! I can't! The Party's words were like a warm current, making me feel full of strength. That night, after writing down the reason for the 130th failure in my diary, I added a sentence: "Listen to the Party, persistence is victory!"
    The next day was the factory's rest day, and it was my turn to be on duty in the morning. At six o'clock in the morning, I entered the factory. Unable to find other workers, I asked the gatehouse guard, Old Yao, to be my assistant and continue the experiment together. Old Yao sat down very seriously, put on his glasses, and used a fountain pen to move back and forth on the lines, checking for problems in sections. From Old Yao's actions, I suddenly got inspiration: Is segmented calibration not a good way? Once the countless lines are divided into sections, it will be easy to solve. So I immediately experimented, and in one morning, I successfully tested the first section; a week later, with the help of other comrades, I completed the experiment of the second section... In this way, I tested segment by segment and achieved success segment by segment. The first "Chinese-style" single five-use high-temperature calibrator was finally born. Once the ideas were opened up, the methods came one after another. Then, I designed a six-use high-temperature calibrator, which was half the size of the five-use one, and saved nearly one-third of the materials.
    With the support of the Party and the help of the collective, the first round of competing with imperialism in science and technology was victorious. However, this is just a beginning. (Attached picture)

### 创造中国式的产品

　　创造中国式的产品
　　上海科培仪器厂青年工人　于志达
    一种高级精密的六用高温校验仪，在我们上海科培仪器厂诞生了。从而我的“跳出仿造圈子，创造中国式的第一流仪器”的理想，在党的支持和群众的帮助下实现了。这件产品投入生产以后，可以做到一个人顶三个人，一份材料顶四份用，一件产品顶六件用。
    创制单只多用高温校验仪的事实，使我深深地体会到：只要听党的话，用毛泽东思想武装自己，加上个人不懈的努力，我们工人就能成为神通广大的人，什么困难也挡不住我们前进的道路。
          一场新的战斗
    我原来是中国人民志愿军的通讯兵。1957年5月从朝鲜复员回国的时候，部队首长在临别时教导我们说：“我们在朝鲜战场上打败了美帝国主义，现在，你们复员了，要在建设社会主义的新的岗位上再跟帝国主义较量一番。”我牢记着部队首长的教导，来到了上海科培仪器厂。
    我进科培厂的时候，厂里只有十七个工人，生产的却是现代化机器的眼睛——仪器。当时，我们厂的产品都是照外国的仪器式样，依样画葫芦地仿造出来的。这种仿造产品，做起来费时间费料，用起来又笨又娇，简直像朝鲜战场上的美国兵！有一次，一个从杭州来的采购员买去了一只仪表，带着它乘上公共汽车，车子还没有走上一站路，仪器上的检流器就被震坏了。当这个采购员跑回厂来责问的时候，我真感到难受。厂里工人也都和我一样，看看这些“老爷仪器”就冒火。大家说：我们要生产一种崭新的仪表。”
          为了多快好省
    要战胜敌人，先要炼好“枪法”。从此，我就刻苦钻研，摸索仪器的制造原理。每天一早，我就早点上班，利用间隙时间，从一个零件摸到另一个零件，从一条线路摸到另一条线路，仔仔细细地看。遇到不明白的问题，把它记下来，一有空就请教老师傅和技术员；在车站上等公共汽车，我也掏出来捉摸一番。时间久了，看得多了，我就慢慢地发现这种外国型号的仪器有好多地方不合理。我想，这样既浪费材料，又浪费工时，不革它的命，就不能多快好省。这时也有人说：
  “人家外国货定型都定了好几十年，能改就早改了，恐怕改不得吧！”我想：我们中国人要有中国人的志气，难道一辈子就只能踩着外国人的脚印子走路？人家停下来不走，我们也跟着他不走，哪一天才能赶上和超过人家呢？不行！我们应当闯出自己的路子，赶到帝国主义前面去。管它什么定型不定型，能定就能改，什么都是人干的！
    就在这时候，党给我撑了腰。厂支部书记对我说：
  “小于，你想得对！外国货不符合多快好省的要求，我们就要革它的命！创造我们中国式的仪器！”党支部书记的话，给了我很大的鼓舞，我感到混身是劲，信心十足。从此，每接一段线路，每钻一个眼子，我都要想一想：这到底有没有作用？能不能革掉？可不可代替？对仿造产品所进行的革命，就这样开始了。
          跳出仿造圈子
    对仿造产品的革命是开始了，但不可能一下子全部革下来，我就来个各个击破。今天改进一个零件，明天去掉一只螺丝，后天再压缩几根线路，天天开它一刀，革它一点，不断地革，越革越有门路，越革越有信心。高温校验仪上的开关线路，从三十六根减少到十九根。每革一次，仪器就向多快好省迈进了一步；每革一次，仪器就向“中国式”走近了一步。有一种外国式电桥，我在党的领导和同志们的帮助下，经过十三次革命，使它的零件从六十五种减少到三十二种，终于脱胎换骨，变成“中国式”的袖珍电桥了。
    改革产品的节节胜利，更加鼓舞了我跳出圈子自行设计的决心。有一天，我走过办公室，偶然看到一张南京永利化工厂和本厂签订的订货合同，上面写着要四百度的、八百度的、一千二百度的、一千六百度的不同规格的高温校验仪。我当时想：为什么不能叫一种仪器兼它四五种职能呢？这样可以节省多少材料，可以缩短多少工时呀！市委不是号召我们要“增产不增人”么，为什么不能创造省工省料、单只多用的仪器呢？主意一打定，我就开始找资料。可是，这种仪器在世界上是没有的，跑遍了大大小小的书店，图书馆，找不到一点资料，出路只有一条：自己摸索，自己创造。我脑子里无时无刻不想着这个问题，吃饭想、走路想、白天想，晚上想。我身上带的那个小本子，横七竖八地画满了许多线路图，可还没有找到门道。党支部知道我碰到了困难，特地召集了一次各车间、小组的“诸葛亮会”，许多老师傅都一起来帮我出主意。经过一个星期的苦战，第一张线路图总算搞出来了。
    有了草图，还只是跨出了第一步。在实际制造和试验过程中，还碰到了一连串的技术问题。第一次装好以后，一校验，检流计指针一动也不动，拆开一看，原来是上下电阻没有对准；第二次装好后一校验，指针又一边倒，又只好拆掉；第三次接错一根线；第四次……每一次失败，我都把失败的情形纪录下来。当我有点灰心的时候，上海市长宁区团委正召开青年活动分子大会，会上介绍了王林鹤同志经过三百七十一次试验终于制成高压电桥的事迹。当时，我很感动，心想：自己才不过失败了上百次，决不能向困难低头！我要学习王林鹤，干、再干！
          坚持就是胜利
    一天深夜，我一个人对着工作台上摆着的零件发呆，这已经是苦战半个多月，失败到第一百三十次了，可是还毫无头绪。正当我感到又着急又难受的时候，突然，一只温暖的手拍在我的肩膀上，我听到了一个亲切的声音：“小于，怎么样，搞得差不多了吧。”原来党支部书记又到车间里来了。党支部书记看到我的精神，严肃而又恳切地对我说，“小于，要坚持，害怕困难，就等于在战场上向敌人投降！”党支部书记这几句话，一下子触到了我的心事。对呀！难道就这样输掉吗？不！不能！党的话像一股暖流，使我感到混身充满了力量。这天晚上，我在日记上写下了第一百三十次失败的原因以后，又接着写了一句：“听党的话，坚持就是胜利！”
    第二天是厂休息日，上午轮着我值班。清早六点钟，我就进厂了。找不到其他工人，我就请门房间警卫老姚当我的助手，一起继续试验。老姚很认真地坐下来，戴起眼镜，用一支墨水笔在线路上来回转动，分块检验毛病。从老姚这个动作中，我突然得到了启发：分段校验，不就是个好办法吗？千头万绪的线路一经分段，就容易解决了。于是我立刻试验，一个上午，就把第一段试验成功了；一个星期后，我又在其他几个同志的帮助下，完成了第二段的试验，……就这样逐段试验，逐段获得成功，第一台“中国式”的单只五用的高温校验仪，终于诞生了。思路一打开，办法源源来。接着，我又设计出一种六用的高温校验仪，体积比五用的还小一半，材料又节省了将近三分之一。
    在党的支持和集体的帮助下，跟帝国主义在科学技术上较量的第一个回合是胜利了。但是，这只是一个开始。（附图片）
