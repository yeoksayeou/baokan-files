Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: Returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou held a rally on the 5th, strongly protesting the West Java military authorities of Indonesia for deliberately creating a bloody incident of massacring overseas Chinese, and unanimously demanded that the Indonesian government punish the murderers and immediately stop persecuting overseas Chinese.

At a symposium jointly held by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Xu Chongde, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that powerful groups in Indonesia are intensifying the persecution of overseas Chinese and even creating bloody tragedies of massacring overseas Chinese. The purpose is to further undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. We, the Chinese people, can never tolerate such crimes. He demanded that the Indonesian government be responsible for severely punishing the murderers and taking effective measures to stop anti-Chinese activities.

Yang Tangcheng, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from New Zealand, said: "Powerful groups in Indonesia continue to persecute overseas Chinese by means of arrest, summons, and armed threats by military police. Now, they have even developed to the point of shooting and killing our unarmed compatriots. This crime will inevitably be condemned by the people of the world."

Ren Xu, the director of teaching affairs of Jakarta Zhonghua Middle School who had just returned to the motherland on the 4th, said angrily that the West Java military authorities used weapons to slaughter pregnant overseas Chinese women. This is by no means accidental. This is a bloody tragedy deliberately created by forces in Indonesia that are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship. The 58-year-old veteran overseas Chinese educator said passionately that we overseas Chinese have a strong motherland as our backing today, and we will never tolerate their persecution of us.

Hong Jianren, a returned overseas Chinese from Java, said that we are compatriots of the People's Republic of China, not overseas orphans of the old China. We do not bully others, but we cannot be bullied by others casually. We express our strong protest against the bloody atrocities of the West Java military authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th: Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held a rally on the afternoon of the 5th, strongly protesting the bloody atrocities of the West Java military authorities of Indonesia in massacring overseas Chinese.

The returned overseas Chinese representatives who participated in the rally had all been forcibly relocated by powerful groups in Indonesia, resulting in displacement and a lack of livelihood before returning to China. When they heard the news that the West Java military authorities had dispatched military police to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese in the Zhima market on July 3, causing a bloody incident, they were very angry. At the meeting, they unanimously lodged a strong protest against the atrocities of the West Java military authorities and demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims, immediately stop the forced relocation, stop the anti-Chinese activities, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

Gao Sen, deputy director of the office of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, pointed out in his speech that the Chinese people and the Indonesian people are friendly. Those who are engaged in anti-Chinese activities and even created this bloody tragedy are only a small number of reactionaries who are hostile to the friendship between the two countries. He demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims, and compensate for the losses. He also demanded that the Indonesian government comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue in accordance with the three-point proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi.

Lin Hanqin, a returned overseas Chinese from West Java, angrily accused the West Java military authorities of forcing him and his parents and brothers to relocate and imprisoning his family in a concentration camp for more than three months. He also pointed out that the Chinese people today cannot be insulted, and a strong motherland is the backing of overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government should prioritize the friendship between the two countries and immediately stop all anti-Chinese activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 6th: Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students in Kunming held a rally on the 5th, strongly protesting the crime of the West Java military authorities of Indonesia in shooting overseas Chinese. They demanded that the Indonesian government immediately punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims, compensate the injured overseas Chinese for their losses, release the arrested overseas Chinese, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again; and immediately stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese.

This meeting was presided over by the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

At the beginning of the meeting, Wang Zhaoming, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, spoke first. He said:

"All returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students in Yunnan Province express our utmost indignation at the crime of the West Java military authorities of Indonesia in forcibly relocating overseas Chinese by force and creating bloody tragedies; we lodge a serious protest against the powerful groups in Indonesia for launching another large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities; and we express our sympathy and support to the persecuted overseas Chinese in Indonesia."

Wang Zhaoming firmly demanded that the Indonesian government immediately punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims, compensate the injured overseas Chinese for their losses, ensure that similar incidents do not occur again; and quickly stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese and be responsible for repatriating the persecuted and displaced overseas Chinese to China.

Returned overseas Chinese Zhang Xiangru, returned overseas Chinese student Li Yuxin, Yang Meiying, and more than a dozen other people spoke at the meeting successively. In their speeches, in addition to unanimously expressing their angry protest against the shooting of overseas Chinese by the West Java military authorities of Indonesia, they also accused the powerful groups in Indonesia of their various persecutions. Li Yuxin, a returned overseas Chinese student from West Java, accused that when my father was ill last year, powerful groups in Indonesia forced us to relocate. My father was ill and could not walk, and was beaten by the military police in the West Java region of Indonesia.

Finally, more than 100 returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students unanimously passed the protest letter of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese against the anti-China, anti-Chinese, and bloody incidents of the powerful groups in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: Representatives of returned overseas Chinese in Tianjin held a rally, angrily protesting the crime of the West Java military authorities of Indonesia in creating a massacre of overseas Chinese, and resolutely demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers of overseas Chinese, compensate the families of the victims, release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop the forced relocation, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

Liao Canhui, chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the meeting that the massacre of overseas Chinese by the West Java military authorities once again proves that powerful groups in Indonesia not only have not stopped their anti-Chinese plans, but have intensified them. He said that today's overseas Chinese are overseas Chinese with a strong motherland as their backing. Overseas Chinese are no longer overseas orphans. The legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese must be respected, and all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities must be stopped immediately. Shi Dehua, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a teacher at Tianjin Medical College, said that the Zhima market massacre of overseas Chinese was deliberately created by the Indonesian reactionary group. They want to achieve ulterior motives through this evil means, but their conspiracy will not succeed. We resolutely demand that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers of overseas Chinese. Lin Meilan, a teacher at the Second Middle School, Yi Qishan, a doctor at the Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, and other representatives of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia expressed their condolences to the families of the victims.

Students from Nankai University, Tianjin University, Hebei University and other universities also held rallies, strongly protesting the atrocities of the West Java military authorities of Indonesia in shooting overseas Chinese women. (Attached photo)

    在广东省和广州市归国华侨联合会联合举行的座谈会上，广东省归国华侨联合会委员、印度尼西亚归侨许崇德说，印度尼西亚有势力集团变本加厉的迫害华侨，甚至制造惨杀华侨的流血惨剧，目的是为了进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系。我们中国人民决不能容忍这种罪行。他要求印度尼西亚政府负责严惩凶手，采取有效措施制止排华活动。
