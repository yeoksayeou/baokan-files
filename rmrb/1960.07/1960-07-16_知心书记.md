　　Intimate Secretary
　　Liu Qingshan
    The people of Tang County, Hebei Province, like to call Mu Bingchen, secretary of the Tang County Party Committee Secretariat, "intimate secretary," "reliable support," and "good housekeeper"...

    Mu Bingchen was born in Tang County. Before liberation, he led the county's guerrillas in severely打击 (dǎ jī, strike) the Japanese devils. After liberation, he joined the people of the county in fighting against nature and building socialism. He traveled around the mountainous and plain areas of Tang County all year round. Every mountain village in the county has his footprints, and he has intimate friends everywhere. People look forward to him coming to solve problems when they encounter difficulties, and they also look forward to him coming when they have happy events, so they can talk to him and make him happy too. Secretary Mu has taken root among the masses.

　  Cadres "Go to Sea," Commune Members "Capture the Dragon"

    In January of this year, the biting cold wind whistled. The Wohuosi (卧佛寺) Tan Reservoir in Baihe Commune was covered with white ice. A canal more than ten miles long downstream of the reservoir was opened, and it was time to release water that day. The terraced fields, which had been dry for many years, were about to be water-conserved, and the commune members were so happy! Thousands of pairs of eyes were fixed on the reservoir gate, hoping that the reservoir water would flow into the terraced fields along the new canal. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gate was opened and water was released, the water all leaked out, leaving only a layer of small ice floes. When the commune members saw this, they felt a chill in their hearts. Some said, "Alas! We put in a lot of effort, but in the end, it's still unusable." At this time, Secretary Mu, wearing his gray cloth coat from the Anti-Japanese War, was running back and forth on the canal. Although the weather was cold, he was covered in sweat.

    What to do? Secretary Mu repeatedly thought about it and called the county party committee. The county commercial department decided to allocate three rolls of oil felt to repair the leaking canal. However, Secretary Mu thought: Oil felt is good, but it would cost four hundred yuan. Could this canal be repaired without spending money so that it doesn't leak? He immediately found four old farmers, Ma Jianxing, Ma Fu, and others, to study solutions to this problem together.

    Old farmer Ma Jianxing said that he used to farm in Dongpo and dug a small canal three zhang (丈, a Chinese unit of length, approx. 3.3 meters) long. At first, it also leaked water. Later, he used small sand grains to fill it twice and then used clay to smooth it, and the canal stopped leaking water. He had been using that canal to irrigate for more than ten years. When Secretary Mu heard this, he felt that every sentence made sense, and his heart brightened. After discussing it with the commune party committee secretary, he decided to use this method to repair the leaking canal. Therefore, more than two hundred commune members were organized to start work immediately. Secretary Mu also went into the water to smooth the canal with the commune members.

    Cadres "go to sea," commune members "capture the dragon." Secretary Mu's going into the water to smooth the canal inspired the enthusiasm of all the commune members. With cold feet but warm hearts, more than two hundred commune members braved the cold wind, stepped on the icy water, filled and smoothed the sand, working enthusiastically. After three days of hard work, the more than ten-mile-long canal was smoothed twice. After repairing the leaking canal, the reservoir water flowed into the terraced fields, irrigating more than 1,200 mu (亩, a Chinese unit of area, approx. 0.067 hectares) of wheat and bare land.

  　"Intimate Secretary" Became a "Scout"

    Last winter, with the start of construction of the Xidayang Reservoir, one of the six major hubs for harnessing the Hai River, more than 5,000 farming households in the Dayang Basin needed to be moved to higher ground. This heavy burden fell on Secretary Mu's shoulders again. Carrying his small luggage roll, he came to the Dayang Basin and began the relocation work. He was with the commune members every day, moving bricks, pulling wood, carrying luggage, building houses… A commune member joked with him: "Old Mu, you used to carry loads for the landlords, and now you're carrying them for us again." Another commune member immediately retorted: "No, this can't be called carrying loads, this is called serving us. He's not a hired hand, he's our housekeeper."

    Secretary Mu led the commune members in building new peasant villages on the reservoir. The housing problem was solved. However, new problems followed: The reservoir site of the Dayang Reservoir took up a lot of land, leaving only three fen (分, a Chinese unit of area, 1/10 of a mu) of land per person, and production decreased. The problem of feeding more than 30,000 people was like a heavy stone weighing on Secretary Mu's heart. The commune members were not worried, they said: "With the Party, and with Comrade Lao Mu, there is nothing to worry about. Lao Mu will find a way to solve our food, clothing, and expenses." The more the masses trusted the Party, the more Secretary Mu felt the responsibility was great. For this matter, he discussed it with the cadres and discussed it with his friends, and finally found a way: mobilize the masses to vigorously develop sideline production, open up various economic avenues, and increase income. Thus, nine sideline professional teams, such as charcoal burning and brick making, were organized.

    Secretary Mu was not satisfied with this. He continued to look for ways to increase the income of the commune members. One day, he saw the small baskets used by the construction workers at the reservoir to carry earth. He suddenly thought: If he could find vitex, weaving baskets would also be a source of income. But where to find vitex? That night, he found his old friends Liu Zhizhong and Zhao Quanzi to discuss. Both friends said that they had never seen vitex nearby, unless they went to the distant mountains to look. After breakfast the next morning, Secretary Mu braved the heavy snow and headed north to find vitex in the mountains. Snowflakes were flying, and the wind was howling. In the heavy snow, Secretary Mu climbed over several small hills and crossed several large ridges, finally climbing to the top of Jianfu Mountain. The mountain was high and there were many plants. Here, he found a large amount of vitex and mountain grass. He immediately returned as if he had found a treasure, and discussed with the village party secretary to organize a vitex harvesting professional team of more than two hundred people, led by him, to enter the mountain. People excitedly said: "Lao Mu is not only our 'intimate secretary,' but also our good 'scout.' Without him scouting in the snow, how would we know that there is vitex here?" Due to the specific leadership of Secretary Mu and the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members, sideline production was in full swing. The income of the commune members increased greatly. In addition to food, clothing, and expenses, there was surplus money.

　　The Story of "Hundred-Dish Vegetable"

    One day in June of this year, Secretary Mu came to Songzhuang Village on Yangzhuang Ridge under the scorching sun at noon. As soon as he entered the village, he was surrounded by a group of commune members. They pulled and tugged, so affectionately. Old commune member Feng Caizi, in his sixties, pushed the crowd apart with both hands and, without saying a word, forcibly pulled Secretary Mu to his team's cafeteria and brought him a bowl of "hundred-dish vegetable" made by himself with cucumbers, scallions… "Lao Mu, eat it quickly, this is our wish…" Before he finished speaking, commune members from other teams also brought "hundred-dish vegetable." Since everyone respected Secretary Mu so much, why didn't they use rice and white flour from the cafeteria to make something good for him to eat, but insisted on giving him a bowl of vegetable? There is a story behind this.

    Originally, this village was located very high, and the ground was full of large bluestones. It was very short of water. People couldn't even water their gardens to grow vegetables, let alone have enough water for eating. Therefore, there was no vegetable garden in this village, and people couldn't eat fresh vegetables. Last year, Secretary Mu came to this village and studied with the old farmers to dig wells and grow vegetables to solve the problem of commune members eating vegetables. After visiting and personally surveying, and finding various bases, a force was organized to dig wells. During the well digging period, Secretary Mu and the branch secretary both lived next to the construction site, going down the well and working with the commune members. The one-meter-long steel drill he used was reduced to only five inches. It took a full twenty-five days. The first well produced water first, and then five villages, Anzhuang, Songzhuang, and Yangzhuang, also produced water. All forty-five stone wells produced water. On the first day of water coming out, men and women in the village went to see the rare sight. People said: "Lao Mu is really a 'godman,' even the stones didn't dare not to produce water when they saw him."

    From then on, this village, which had never had fresh vegetables for generations, became a garden full of various vegetables. The commune members were very grateful to Secretary Mu, so they made "hundred-dish vegetable" for him to eat. This was an extremely precious gift, it was the hearts of thousands of commune members.

　　知心书记
　　刘庆山
    河北省唐县的群众，喜欢称呼县委书记处书记穆丙辰是“知心书记”、“好靠山”、“好管家人”……。
    穆丙辰出生在唐县，解放前，他领导全县游击队狠狠地打击过日本鬼子，解放以后，他又和全县人民一起向大自然开战，建设社会主义。他一年四季奔波在唐县的山区、平原，全县每个山村都留下了他的足迹，到处有他的知心朋友。人们遇到困难盼望他来解决，有了喜事也盼望他来，好和他说说让他也高兴。穆书记在群众当中生了根。
　  干部“下海”，社员“擒龙”
    今年1月，刺骨的寒风飕飕地刮着。白合公社卧佛寺滩水库里结着白花花的冰块。水库下游一道十多里长的渠道开通了，这天要放水。多年干旱的梯田眼看就要实现水利化，社员们是多么高兴啊！几千双眼睛，注视着水库的闸门，盼望着库水顺着新渠，滚滚流进梯田。不料，一开闸门放水，水都漏了，只剩了一层小冰块。社员们一见心里凉了半截，有的说：“唉！费了九牛二虎之力，结果还是落个使不得”。这时，穆书记穿着他那件还是抗战时期的灰布大衣，来回奔跑在渠道上，天气虽冷，他却满头大汗。
    怎么办呢？穆书记反复地思考着，并给县委打了电话。县商业部门为补漏这条大渠，决定调拨给三卷油毡。但穆书记却想：油毡好是好，但没有四百元钱办不了。能不能用不花钱的办法，把这条渠治得不漏水呢？他立刻找到马建兴、马付等四位老农共同研究解决这个问题的办法。
    老农马建兴说，他过去在东坡种地时，开过一道三丈长的小渠，开始也是漏水。后来，他用小砂子粒灌了两次，又用胶泥抹了一下，水渠就不漏水了，他一直用那条水渠浇了十几年水。穆书记一听，感到句句有理，心里亮堂了。和公社党委书记研究以后，决定用这个办法补漏渠。于是，组织了二百多社员，立即动手。穆书记也下水和社员们一起抹渠。
    干部下海，社员擒龙。穆书记下水抹渠，鼓舞了全体社员的干劲。冰冷心热，二百多社员冒着寒风，踩着冰水，灌砂抹砂干得热火朝天。奋战三天，十多里长的渠道普遍抹了两遍。补好了漏渠，库水滚滚流入了梯田，连小麦带白地共浇了一千二百多亩。
  　“知心书记”当了“侦察兵”
    去年冬天，随着根治海河六大枢纽之一——西大洋水库的动工，大洋盆地内的五千多户农民需要迁到高地。这个重担又落到穆书记的肩上。他背着小行李卷来到大洋盆地，开始了移民工作。他天天和社员在一起，搬砖，拉木料，扛行李，盖房子……。一个社员跟他说笑话：“老穆，你过去给地主扛活，现在又给我们扛啦。”另一个社员立刻反驳说：“不，这不能叫扛活，这叫给我们服务，不是长工，是我们的管家人。”
    穆书记领导社员们在水库上建起了农民新村，住房问题解决了。但是，新的问题又接踵而来：大洋水库的库址占去了很多土地，剩下的每人只合三分地，出产减少了。三万多口人的吃饭问题，就像一块千斤大石压在穆书记的心坎上。社员们却不犯愁，他们说：“有党，有老穆同志，什么都用不着担心，咱们的吃穿花用，老穆样样都会给想办法”。群众对党越信任，穆书记越觉得责任重大。为这事，他和干部们研究，和朋友们讨论，终于找到了一个办法：发动群众大搞副业生产，广开多种经济的门路，增加收入。于是组织起烧炭、烧砖等九种副业专业队。
    穆书记并不以此为满足，他继续寻找增加社员收入的办法。一天，他见到水库工地民工担土用的小筐，忽然想到：如果能找到荆条子，编筐和篮子，也是一项收入。但到那儿去找荆条呢？晚上他找到老朋友刘志中、赵全子商量。两位朋友都说在附近没见过那儿有荆条，除非到远处大山上去找找看。第二天早饭后，穆书记冒着大雪，顶着北风到山上去找荆条。雪片飞舞，狂风呼啸，在漫天风雪里，穆书记翻过几座小山，越过几道大岭，终于爬上了尖服山。山高草木多，在这里他找到了大量的荆条和山草。这下子他像得了宝贝似的，立即赶回来，和村支部书记研究决定，组织二百多人的打荆条专业队，由他率领进山。人们激动地说：“老穆不光是咱们的‘知心书记’，还是咱们的好‘侦察兵’。没有他冒雪登山侦察，咱们哪会知道这里有荆条呢？”由于穆书记的具体领导和社员的冲天干劲，副业生产搞得热火朝天。社员的收入大大增加，除去吃穿用，还有多余钱。
　　“百样菜”的故事
    今年6月间的一天，穆书记顶着正午的烈日，来到了杨庄岭上的宋庄村。刚一进村，就被一群社员围起来了。这个拉，那个扯，好不亲切。六十多岁的老社员封才子用两手分开大伙，一句话没说硬把穆书记拉到自己小队的食堂里，把自己亲手用黄瓜、小葱……等作成的一碗“百样菜”端给他吃。“老穆啊，你快吃吧，这可是我们的心愿……”话没说完，其他小队的社员也把“百样菜”送来了。大家既然如此尊敬穆书记，为什么不用食堂里的大米、白面给他做好的吃，而偏叫他吃碗菜呢？这里边有个故事。
    原来，这个村地势很高，地下净是大青石头，很缺水，人们不用说用水浇园种菜，就是连吃饭用水也很困难。因此，这村没有一个菜园子，人们吃不上鲜菜。去年穆书记到这村里来，和老农们一起研究打井种菜，解决社员吃菜问题。经过访问和亲自勘察，找到多方面的根据以后，组织了一支力量打井。在打井期间，穆书记和支书都住到工地旁边，下井和社员一起劳动。他用的一米长的钢钻，打得只剩下了五寸。整整打了二十五天。第一眼井先出水了，接着安庄、宋庄、杨庄等五个村也打出水来了，四十五眼石井全出水了。第一次上水那天，村里男男女女都去看稀罕，人们说：“老穆真是个‘神人’，石头见了他也不敢不出水。”
    从那以后，这个历代吃不上鲜菜的村庄，变成了种有各种蔬菜的园圃了。社员们对穆书记感激不尽，就作成“百样菜”让他吃，这是异常珍贵的礼物，是千万颗社员的心。（附图片）
