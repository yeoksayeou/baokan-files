    Daring to Think, Speak, and Act is the Three Magic Weapons of the Technical Revolution
    Chen Peng, Director of the Track Switcher at Tanggu Station
    In the technical revolution movement, along with the changes in production tools, people's mental outlook has also undergone profound changes. This is the further development of the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.
    The issue of daring to think versus not daring to think is essentially the issue of continuous revolution versus sticking to old ways. Thought is the precursor to action; if you don't dare to think, there's no way to talk about action. If our human ancestors hadn't had the ideal of flying in the sky like birds, or the ideal of swimming in the water like fish, could we be riding in airplanes and ships today? Looking at the cargo yards and platforms of our Tanggu Station, which are filled with both domestically made and foreign-made loading and unloading machines, isn't every single one of them born in the minds of our workers?
    Some people say this: "Thinking is good, but what you think might not have practical significance. Many myths are things people have imagined, but myths are still myths and cannot become reality." To this question, we can answer: A smokeless train was, not long ago, a mythical ideal in people's minds, but now, it has finally become a reality in the hands of the working class. Of course, our daring to think should be based on objective necessity and possibility. Only then will what we think have practical significance and be more likely to turn ideals into reality. For example, eliminating the phenomena of carrying, lifting, and shouldering on our railways is an objective necessity arising from the situation of our country's Great Leap Forward. At the same time, there is also an objective possibility, which is due to the Party's leadership and education, the continuous improvement of the working class's consciousness, the strong desire to rapidly change our country's "poor and blank" face, and our certain material and technical foundation, and so on. As long as we proceed from reality, think boldly, and actively put forward rationalization proposals, we will definitely be able to promote the continuous development of the technical revolution.
    However, it is not enough to just think silently in your mind; we must also dare to speak. What is thought in one person's mind is individual, but once it is spoken, it becomes collective and social. Of course, what we think might not be correct. If it is correct, everyone will affirm it; if it is imperfect, everyone will pool their wisdom to perfect it. If what we think is incorrect or unrealistic, it can sometimes serve as a catalyst. In short, speaking is a further development of thinking. Some people are afraid of being laughed at if they speak out, so they don't dare to speak. This concern is superfluous. Our daring to speak is a concrete manifestation of our strong revolutionary aspirations. In the technical revolution movement, the broad masses of workers used the method of "many voices" to solve difficulties such as lacking design drawings and lacking methods, and finally realized their innovation projects.
    We must not only dare to think and dare to speak, but also dare to act. Without action, thinking and speaking lose their meaning. Only by acting boldly can what we think and say become reality. Turning ideals into reality requires us to put in a lot of effort, and we will encounter many difficulties in the process of doing. But people's subjective initiative is a magic weapon. It all depends on human effort. As long as you dare to act, and gradually recognize objective laws in the process of acting, you can overcome difficulties. As some workers said: "The most important thing is to act. If you act, things will change. If you're afraid of difficulties and don't dare to act, you're not a hero." Practice has proven that the more we do, the more experience we accumulate, and the more ways we have to overcome difficulties. Ren Haizhang, a loading and unloading worker at Tanggu Station, was determined to realize the automation of loading and unloading goods. He not only dared to think boldly, but also dared to act boldly. He also encountered many difficulties in the process of doing, but with the encouragement and support of the Party, he never lost heart, solved many key problems, and finally basically succeeded in the experiment.
    From this, we can conclude that daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act are the three magic weapons for making a great technical revolution. Fully developing the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act will enable the technical revolution to develop continuously, deeply, and persistently.
    In the movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, the employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau have employed a learning format of thesis report meetings. Recently, the Party Committee of the Bureau held a general thesis report meeting in Tianjin, where more than fifty worker theses selected from various grassroots units and more than ten summaries of learning experience were read out. The meeting also exhibited more than 8,000 theses written by employees of the Bureau. We have specially invited Comrade Zhao Wenpu, Secretary of the Beijing Railway Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China, to write an article introducing this mass learning format of thesis report meetings, and have selected several worker theses and summaries of experience read out at the meeting for publication. ——Editor

    敢想敢说敢干是技术革命的三件法宝
    塘沽车站主任扳道员　陈鹏
    在技术革命运动中，随着生产工具的变化，人们的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化，这就是敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格更加发扬光大了。
    敢想与不敢想的问题，实质上是不断革命与故步自封的问题。想是行动的先导，不敢想便谈不到行动。人类的先辈们如果没有像鸟一样地在天空飞翔的理想，如果没有像鱼一样地在水中漫游的理想，难道我们今天能乘上飞机和轮船吗？再看看我们塘沽站的货场和站台，那些林立的土的或洋的装卸机械，又哪一件不曾在我们工人的思想中孕育过呢？
    有人这样说：想是好想，但想的不一定有现实意义。有许多神话就是人想出来的东西，但神话终究是神话，不能成为现实。对于这个问题我们可以这样回答：火车不冒烟在不久以前还是人们的一个神话般的理想，但是现在，在工人阶级的手下终于成为现实了。当然我们的敢想应该建立在客观的必要性和可能性的基础上，我们想的才有现实意义，才更容易使理想成为现实。比如我们铁路要消灭背、抬、扛的现象，这是适应我国大跃进的形势出现的客观的必要性。同时也有客观的可能性，这就是由于党的领导和教育，工人阶级的觉悟不断提高，有迅速改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的强烈愿望，以及我们有一定的物质和技术基础等等。只要我们从实际出发，大胆地想，积极提出合理化建议，我们一定能推动技术革命不断地向前发展。
    不过，只是闷在脑子里想还不行，我们还要敢说。在一个人的脑子里想的东西是个人的，说出来之后，便成了集体的和社会的东西了。当然我们想的东西不一定正确，如果是正确的，大家便会予以肯定，如果是不完善的话，大家便会集思广益，使其达到完善。如果我们想的不正确或是不现实，有时候也可以起到抛砖引玉的作用。总之，说是想的进一步发展。有的人怕说出来被人笑话，所以不敢说，这种顾虑是多余的。我们敢说，是我们有强烈革命愿望的具体表现。在技术革命运动中，广大职工就是用“七嘴八舌”的方法，解决没有设计图纸、没有办法等等困难，而终于实现了自己的革新项目的。
    既要敢想敢说，还要敢干。不干，想和说便失去了意义。只有大胆地干，想的说的东西才能变成现实。要把理想变成现实，需要我们付出很大的力量，在干的过程中也会遇到很多的困难。但人的主观能动性是件法宝，事在人为，只要你敢干，在干中逐渐认识客观规律，才能克服困难。正如有的职工说的：“万事就怕干，你干他就变，怕难不敢干，不是英雄汉”。实践证明，我们越干，积累的经验就越多，我们就越有办法克服困难。塘沽站装卸工任海章，一心想着要搞装卸货物联动化，不但大胆地想，而且大胆地干。他在干的过程中也遇到很多困难，但在党的鼓舞支持下，一直也没有灰心，解决了不少关键问题，最后基本上试验成功了。
    由此我们可以得出结论：敢想、敢说、敢干是大闹技术革命的三件法宝。充分发挥敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，就能使技术革命不断地深入持久的发展。
    北京铁路局职工在学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的运动中，运用了一种论文报告会的学习形式。最近该局党委在天津召开了一次全局性的论文报告会，宣读了从各基层单位选出来的工人论文五十余篇，学习经验总结十余篇。这次会议并展览了该局职工写的论文八千多篇。我们特请中共北京铁路局委员会书记赵文普同志写了一篇介绍论文报告会这一群众性的学习形式的文章，并从会议宣读的工人论文和经验总结中选择几篇发表。　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
