Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 29th: The National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan today jointly submitted a protest letter to the government, protesting the government's suppression of the patriotic struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　This protest letter was submitted to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Ohira by representatives of these four organizations: Kozo Minaguchi, Yoshio Shiga, Tomomi Narita, Koichi Yamamoto, and Miyoo Yanagimoto.

　　Today, Shiga Yoshio, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, also met with Kiyohara Kunikazu, the Prosecutor General of the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, demanding the immediate release of those arrested for demonstrating at the airport against U.S. President’s Press Secretary Hagerty's visit to Tokyo.

　　The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement today demanding the early release of people arrested for participating in patriotic demonstrations and the cessation of searches. The statement condemned the government's suppression of leaders of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" and pointed out that the unified action of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is an exercise of the people's rights stipulated in the Constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 29th: The National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" decided on the 28th to resolutely oppose all illegal suppression of the Japanese people by the government.

　　The conference also decided to launch a struggle to demand the release of those arrested by the police authorities for participating in the anti-American patriotic struggle.

　　The National Council pointed out that the Japanese people's actions against the new "Security Treaty" are an exercise of legitimate rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

　　Meanwhile, Kozo Minaguchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," Minoru Tanaka, a Socialist Party Diet member, Imaharu Oi, a permanent secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Saburo Osawa, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly of the Socialist Party, unanimously refused to be interrogated by the Metropolitan Police Department today, in accordance with the decision of the National Council.

　　The Metropolitan Police Department insisted that their participation in the Japanese people's demonstrations and marches against the new "Security Treaty" and the June 10th incident at Haneda Airport against Hagerty's visit to Tokyo "violated the law" and had requested them four to go to the Metropolitan Police Department for questioning on the morning of the 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 28th: The Central Committee of the Japan Teachers' Union concluded its three-day meeting today after passing a motion on the movement of teachers fighting for the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and against the "performance rating" system.

　　The movement policy of this union, which has 600,000 members, pointed out that low wages, large-scale layoffs of workers, increased labor intensity, suppression of speech, suppression of mass struggles, and the implementation of reactionary militarist education are all manifestations of the bad system maintained by the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The policy stipulates that the teachers' and staff union will launch a signature campaign declaring non-recognition of the new "Security Treaty" and hold a conference to expose the Liberal Democratic Party's atrocities of forcibly passing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet, and more heroically carry out the movement against US military bases and demanding the return of Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan among the broad masses of the people than in the past.

　　When talking about the struggle against the "performance rating" system that restricts the freedom of political thought of teachers and staff, the policy stipulates that September 1st to 15th will be a unified action fortnight against the "performance rating" system. Teachers and staff will hold collective negotiations with local education bureaus to oppose the implementation of this fascist system.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 28th: Two thousand mothers from various parts of Hokkaido, Japan, held a conference in Sapporo on the 24th and 25th. The conference passed a resolution declaring non-recognition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Also participating in this conference was a delegation of wives of miners from the Miike Coal Mine in Omuta City, Kyushu, where miners are fighting against layoffs. The resolution passed at the conference also opposed the government's illegal suppression of workers and participants in the "Security Treaty" movement.

　　Another resolution passed by the conference discussed the impact of rearmament on people's living standards.

    日本共产党中央委员志贺义雄今天还会见最高检察厅检事总长清原邦一，要求立即释放因为在机场示威反对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂到东京而被捕的人。
    日本社会党今天发表声明，要求及早释放因参加爱国示威而被捕的人们，并且停止搜查。声明谴责政府镇压阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议的领导人，并且指出日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的统一行动是行使宪法所规定的国民权利。
