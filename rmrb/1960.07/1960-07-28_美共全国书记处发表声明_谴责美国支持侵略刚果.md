Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 27th: The National Secretariat of the Communist Party USA recently issued a statement strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for supporting Belgian colonialists in their attempt to re-enslave the recently independent people of the Congo.

    The statement pointed out that in the current situation in the Congo, "the black hand of U.S. imperialism is operating in the dark, and U.S. imperialists are colluding with colonialists, especially with Belgian aggressors."

    The statement said, "The joint control by American monopolists and other colonial countries over the rich copper, cobalt, uranium, and other rare minerals stolen from the Congolese exposes the true nature of the so-called 'gentleman's agreement' reached between the State Department and Belgian colonialists." The statement pointed out that the United States is airlifting American troops to the Congo under the pretext of "restoring order," while in the United States itself, black people are suffering from the torment and persecution of racists.

    The statement also condemned the Belgian colonial rule in the Congo as "the ugliest page in human history." "They cut out tongues, cut off ears, and tore apart limbs—they used all these bestial acts against the Congolese who labored like slaves in the diamond fields and copper mines occupied by the Belgian colonialists."

    The statement concluded by calling on the American working people and all American people to give full solidarity and support to the Republic of the Congo.

    美共全国书记处发表声明
    谴责美国支持侵略刚果
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党全国书记处最近发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义支持比利时殖民主义者企图重新奴役不久前获得独立的刚果人民。
    声明指出，在刚果目前的局势中，“美帝国主义的黑手在暗中活动，美帝国主义者同殖民主义者，特别是同比利时侵略者进行着勾结。”
    声明说，“美国垄断者和其他殖民国家对从刚果人那里窃取的丰富的铜矿、钴矿、铀矿和其他稀有矿藏的联合控制，暴露了国务院和比利时殖民主义者之间达成的所谓‘君子协定’的真实性质”。声明指出，美国在所谓“恢复秩序”的借口下把美国兵空运到刚果，而在美国本土，黑人却受着种族主义分子的折磨和迫害。
    声明还谴责比利时殖民主义者在刚果的殖民统治是“人类历史上最丑恶的一页。”“他们割舌、割耳、撕裂手脚，——他们施用所有这些兽行来对付那些像奴隶一样在被比利时殖民主义者所窃据的金刚石产地和铜矿矿井里劳动的刚果人。”
    声明最后号召美国劳动人民和全体美国人民给予刚果共和国充分的声援和支持。
