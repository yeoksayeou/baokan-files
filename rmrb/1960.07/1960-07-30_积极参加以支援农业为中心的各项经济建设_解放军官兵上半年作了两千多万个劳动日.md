Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: In the past six months, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has contributed over 25 million labor days to various national economic constructions centered on supporting agriculture, making significant contributions to China's socialist construction.

This year, the obligatory labor days of the troops participating in national economic construction are concentrated on basic construction projects in industry, agriculture, and transportation, as well as seasonal assistance to the people and emergency relief and disaster relief efforts in the most urgent and needed areas. In participating in industrial, transportation, and urban construction, troops in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Kunming, Chengdu, Jinan, and Shenyang regions participated in 403 new and expanded construction projects for enterprises such as Shanghai Steel, Kunming Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, and Jiangsu Fertilizer Plant; participated in the construction of over 500 kilometers of railway subgrade and 5,351 kilometers of highways; and participated in 531 relatively large urban construction projects. In addition, more than 680,000 truck trips were dispatched to support local transportation, carrying more than 8.54 million tons of materials.

In terms of supporting agricultural production, the PLA invested the most effort in water conservancy construction. In the first half of the year, the various troops participated in the construction of a total of 3,936 water conservancy projects, including larger ones such as the Shenpan Water Conservancy Irrigation Project in Liaoning and the Dongping Lake Reservoir in Shandong. In participating in the construction, the troops, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, went wherever they were directed. Commanders at all levels, like executing combat missions, personally went to the construction sites, working alongside the soldiers as role models on the one hand, and directing the troops' operations on the spot on the other. During the severe cold season, the vast number of officers and soldiers, unafraid of the freezing weather, braved the wind and snow to carry out construction; in the sweltering summer, they sweated profusely and worked diligently in the scorching heat, fully demonstrating the boundless enthusiasm of the people's soldiers for the cause of socialist construction. In participating in the construction of the Dongping Lake Reservoir, a certain unit of the Jinan region troops fully mobilized the masses, engaged in technical innovation, and gradually increased the stone quarrying operation from 0.2 cubic meters of block stone per person per day to 2 cubic meters, and the earthwork operation from an average of 4 cubic meters of earth per person per day to 10 cubic meters. The amount of earth and stone completed by the end of June, converted according to the construction quota, was completed 100 days ahead of schedule, and the quality fully met the design requirements, and was rated as a national red flag unit for water conservancy construction. A certain unit of the Shenyang region troops, in the twenty-four days of labor constructing a reservoir, innovated 48 kinds of tools, increased work efficiency by an average of five times, and completed the construction task ahead of schedule by five days and 48%.

While contributing a large amount of labor to basic construction, the vast number of officers and soldiers enthusiastically put forward the slogan "Even with a thousand tasks, we must be busy with agricultural technical transformation," determined to contribute to the early realization of the Agricultural Development Program. Many factories, technical schools, and repair units, based on their own professional expertise, actively tapped technical potential under the premise of completing their own tasks, and vigorously helped people's communes build and expand agricultural machinery factories, farm implement repair factories, and manufacture and repair various agricultural machines. A certain unit of the Shenyang region troops, in the case of simple equipment and insufficient materials, dared to think and dared to act, adopted the method of "sending technology to the door," and helped the farm implement factory of the resident people's commune to innovate tools, so that the factory's average work efficiency increased by 13 times and output value increased by 4 times. A certain tractor management school, combined with teaching activities, used scrap steel to rush-produce a set of mechanical equipment including lathes, drilling machines, electric welding machines, and electric saws to support the agricultural machinery factory of the resident people's commune, enabling the factory's workers to successfully trial-produce more than ten kinds of agricultural machines such as rice transplanters, sprayers, and cotton seeders. A certain unit stationed in Jilin helped Jiaohe County repair and erect 200 kilometers of telephone lines, 270 kilometers of broadcast lines, repaired 7,000 broadcast loudspeakers, and installed 30 amplifiers for telephone conferences, enabling the county to complete the repair of broadcast and telephone lines ten months ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year, the various troops manufactured and repaired 55,542 various machines for local areas and people's communes, and processed and repaired 251,945 various mechanical parts. The various troops also adopted the method of taking apprentices and running training classes to train 39,693 various technical personnel such as electricians, blacksmiths, lathe operators, drivers, and health workers for local areas and people's communes.

In overcoming various natural disasters, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the various troops did not avoid difficulties and dangers and fought alongside the people. When a drought occurred in the stationed area of a certain unit of the Lanzhou region troops, they put forward the slogan "Declare war on drought, compete with the sky for water, and ask for grain from water," and in a short time, they helped the commune build more than 30 canals and irrigate more than 60,000 mu of land. After receiving the anti-drought notice from the higher authorities, a certain unit of the Beijing region troops mobilized overnight, marched overnight, arrived in the anti-drought area at dawn, and immediately joined the battle. The Air Force dispatched a total of 353 sorties of aircraft to carry out artificial rainfall in parts of Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, and other provinces and cities, assisting local people's communes to alleviate the drought. Troops in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Jinan and other regions also extracted a large number of technical equipment, materials and technical personnel to support the anti-drought struggle, boosting the people's confidence in overcoming the drought and winning a bumper harvest. In the struggle against wind and floods, the officers and soldiers of the troops took the lead. According to incomplete statistics from January to June, the various troops dispatched more than 160,000 people, 796 ship sorties, 271 aircraft sorties, and a large number of vehicles to participate in the struggle for emergency rescue and disaster relief. On June 9, when Guangdong and Fujian provinces were hit by strong typhoons, Lieutenant General Liu Peishan of the Fujian Front troops, Major General Xie Ming of the Guangzhou region troops, and others personally went to the scene to direct the troops to rescue the lives and property of the people. When the flood control embankment of Jingxi Commune in Fujian Province breached, 135 officers and soldiers and many commune members immediately jumped into the water and built a "dam" with their bodies, winning time and blocking the flood, saving more than 1,000 households and more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields from flooding. The lofty communist style of selflessness of the officers and soldiers has been warmly praised by the local Party and government leading organs and the broad masses of the people.

    积极参加以支援农业为中心的各项经济建设
    解放军官兵上半年作了两千多万个劳动日
    新华社29日讯　半年来，中国人民解放军以两千五百多万个劳动日，参加了以支援农业为中心的国家各项经济建设，对我国社会主义建设事业又作出重大贡献。
    今年，部队参加国家经济建设的义务劳动日，集中使用在工业、农业、交通运输等基本建设工程和季节性的助民劳动以及抢险救灾等最紧急、最需要的地方。在参加工业、交通运输和城市建设中，南京、广州、昆明、成都、济南和沈阳等地区部队，参加了上钢、昆钢、重庆钢铁厂和江苏化肥厂等企业新建和扩建工程四百零三项；参加修建铁路路基五百多公里，修建公路五千三百五十一公里；参加城市建设较大工程五百三十一项。此外，还出动汽车六十八万多辆次支援地方运输，载运物资八百五十四万多吨。
    在支援农业生产方面，解放军投入力量最大的是兴修水利。上半年各部队参加修建的水利工程共有三千九百三十六项，其中较大的有辽宁沈盘水利灌溉工程、山东东平湖水库等。在参加建设中，各部队在地方党委统一领导下，指到哪里，打到哪里。各级指挥员像执行战斗任务一样，亲临工地，一方面跟班劳动，作士兵的表率，另一方面就地指挥部队作业。广大官兵在严寒的季节里，不怕天寒地冻，冒风雪进行施工；在酷热的夏天，汗流浃背，冒炎暑辛勤劳动，充分表现了人民子弟兵对社会主义建设事业的无限热情。济南地区部队某部在参加东平湖水库建设中，各级党委充分发动了群众，大闹技术革新，使采石作业由每人日采块石零点二立方米逐步提高到二立方米，土工作业由每人每天平均出土四立方米上升到十立方米。6月底完成的土、石方数量，按施工定额折算，提前了一百天，质量完全符合设计要求，被评为全国水利建设红旗单位。沈阳地区部队某部在修建一个水库的二十四天劳动中，革新工具四十八种，平均提高工效五倍，提前五天超额48％完成施工任务。
    在付出大量劳动力参加基本建设的同时，广大官兵满腔热情地提出“千忙万忙，也要为农业技术改造忙”的口号，决心为提前实现农业发展纲要贡献力量。许多工厂、技术学校和修理单位，根据自己专业特长，在完成本身任务的前提下，积极挖技术潜力，大力帮助人民公社新建和扩建农业机械厂、农具修配厂和制造修理各种农业机械。沈阳地区部队某部，在设备简单、材料不足的情况下，敢想敢干，采取“送技术上门”的办法，帮助驻地人民公社农具厂革新工具，使这个厂平均提高工效十三倍，产值提高四倍。某拖拉机管理学校，结合教学活动，用废钢铁赶制了一套包括车床、钻床、电焊机和电锯等机械设备，支援驻地人民公社的农业机械厂，使这个厂的职工，试制成功插秧机、喷雾机、棉花播种机等十余种农业机械。驻吉林部队某部帮助蛟河县整修、架设电话线二百公里，广播线二百七十公里，检修广播喇叭七千个，安装电话会议用的扩大机三十部，使这个县提前十个月完成广播、电话线的检修任务。据不完全统计，上半年各部队为地方和人民公社制造和修理各种机器五万五千五百四十二台，加工修理各种机械二十五万一千九百四十五件。各部队还采用带徒弟和开办训练班的办法，为地方和人民公社培养训练电工、锻工、车工、驾驶员、卫生员等各种技术人员三万九千六百九十三名。
    在战胜各种自然灾害中，各部队广大官兵都是不避艰险，与人民群众并肩作战。兰州地区部队某部在驻地发生旱情时，提出“向干旱宣战、与天争水、向水要粮”的口号，短时间内，帮助公社修水渠三十多条，浇田六万多亩。北京地区部队某部接到上级抗旱通知后，连夜动员、连夜行军，拂晓到达抗旱地区，立即投入战斗。空军共出动飞机三百五十三架次，在广东、山东、河北、北京等省市的部分地区进行了人工降雨，协助当地人民公社减轻了旱情。北京、南京、武汉、广州、济南等地区部队还抽出大批技术设备、物资器材和技术人员支援抗旱斗争，鼓舞了人民战胜旱灾夺丰收的信心。在抗风、抗洪斗争中，部队官兵更是奋勇当先。据1至6月的不完全统计，各部队共出动十六万多人，舰艇七百九十六艘次，飞机二百七十一架次和大批汽车，投入抢险救灾的斗争。6月9日，当广东、福建省连受强台风袭击时，福建前线部队刘培善中将、广州地区部队谢明少将等亲临现场，指挥部队抢救人民群众的生命财产。福建省荆溪公社的防洪堤决口时，一百三十五名官兵和许多社员立即跳入水中用身体筑成一座“堤”，赢得了时间，堵住了洪水，使一千多户人家和三千多亩稻田免于受淹。官兵们这种舍己为人的崇高的共产主义风格，受到各地党政领导机关和广大人民群众的热烈赞扬。
