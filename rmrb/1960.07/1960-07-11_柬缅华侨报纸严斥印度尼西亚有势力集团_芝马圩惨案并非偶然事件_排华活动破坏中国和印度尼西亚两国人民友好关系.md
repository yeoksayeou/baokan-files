Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 9th: Overseas Chinese newspapers here have been publishing editorials for days condemning the increasingly intensified anti-Chinese activities of powerful Indonesian groups and strongly protesting the massacre of overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang by the West Java Army authorities under their instigation.

　　The "Gongshang Daily" commentary on the 8th pointed out that the massacre of overseas Chinese women in Cimahe occurred after the Indonesian government made a promise to stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese. The commentary said that these overseas Chinese were upright, law-abiding, and hardworking, but they were brutally murdered, which is shocking.

　　The newspaper condemned the despicable means of the head of the Indonesian Army Intelligence Department and the press officer of the West Java Military Authority for falsely accusing the overseas Chinese of attempting to "seize the soldiers' weapons" in order to deny their guilt. The newspaper said: The relevant military authorities and right-wing newspapers in Indonesia portrayed the victimized overseas Chinese as "horrifying," while depicting those Indonesian soldiers who were stained with the blood of innocent overseas Chinese as "lambs." The newspaper said, but even a three-year-old child would not believe such lies.

　　The "Gongshang Daily" commented on this tragedy on the 6th, saying: It should be pointed out that this murder of overseas Chinese was premeditated, not accidental.

　　The "Mianhua Daily" said in its commentary that the brutal act of the Indonesian army killing overseas Chinese obviously does not conform to the good wishes of the Indonesian people. The newspaper pointed out that this is a means for powerful Indonesian groups to please imperialism and undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

　　The newspaper pointed out in its editorial on the 8th that the Indonesian people are friendly to the overseas Chinese and that they do not need to gain any benefits from the blood of the overseas Chinese. It said that anti-Chinese activities directly violate the wishes of the Indonesian people to get along with the Chinese people and the overseas Chinese in a friendly manner. Moreover, it is certain that this activity greatly damages the Bandung spirit and the prestige of the Republic of Indonesia.

　　The newspaper said that what is even more serious is that after the Chinese government has expressed its willingness to resolve the issue of overseas Chinese with the Indonesian government in a friendly manner and has taken some initiatives in this regard, anti-Chinese activities have intensified and even created bloody tragedies.

　　"Shenghuo Wu Bao", "Meijiang Daily" and other newspapers have also published commentaries condemning this atrocity. All these newspapers demanded that the forced relocation of overseas Chinese be stopped immediately, that the murderers be punished immediately, and that the families of the victims be compensated. These newspapers also said that the Indonesian authorities must ensure that the same incident does not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 9th: Yangon overseas Chinese newspapers "Renmin Bao" and "Xin Yangguang Bao" both published editorials today, strongly protesting the atrocities of powerful Indonesian groups instructing the West Java army to shoot and kill two overseas Chinese women.

　　The editorial of "Renmin Bao" said that the powerful Indonesian groups cannot deny the bloody facts in front of the people of the world, even though they spread rumors in an attempt to cover up their crimes.

　　The editorial said that the 300,000 overseas Chinese in Myanmar firmly support the solemn attitude of the Chinese government and express their strong indignation at the Indonesian powerful groups instructing the army to shoot and kill overseas Chinese women. The editorial demanded that the Indonesian government "punish the murderers; compensate the families of the deceased; and immediately stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese."

　　The editorial pointed out that the purpose of the large-scale anti-Chinese activities launched by the powerful Indonesian groups is to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

　　"Xin Yangguang Bao" strongly condemned the evil activities planned by the powerful Indonesian groups in an editorial entitled "Immediately Stop the Bloody Hands". The editorial expressed support for the Chinese government's attitude and the just stand taken by the overseas Chinese in Indonesia to defend their legitimate rights.

　　柬缅华侨报纸严斥印度尼西亚有势力集团
　　芝马圩惨案并非偶然事件
　　排华活动破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好关系
    新华社金边9日电　这里的华侨报纸连日发表社论谴责印度尼西亚有势力集团变本加厉地进行排华活动，并对在他们策动下西爪哇陆军当局残杀华侨妇女杨木妹和叶金娘的惨案提出强烈的抗议。
      “工商日报”8日的评论指出，杀害芝马圩华侨妇女的惨案是在印度尼西亚政府作出停止迫迁华侨的诺言之后发生的。评论说，这些华侨是正直的、守法的和勤劳的，但是他们却惨遭毒手，这是令人震惊的。
    这家报纸谴责印度尼西亚陆军情报部负责人和西爪哇军事当局新闻官反诬华侨企图“夺取军人的武器”以图抵赖罪责的卑鄙手段。报纸说：印度尼西亚有关军事当局和右翼报纸把受害的华侨描写成“可怖”的样子，而把双手沾满无辜华侨鲜血的那些印度尼西亚军人说成是“羔羊”。报纸说，可是，这种谎言连三岁的孩子也不会相信。
    “工商日报”在6日评论这一惨案时说：应当指出，这一杀害华侨的事件是预谋的，而不是偶然发生的。
    “棉华日报”在评论中说，印度尼西亚军队杀害华侨的残暴行为显然不符合印度尼西亚人民的良好愿望。报纸指出，这是印度尼西亚有势力集团讨好帝国主义和破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系的一种手段。
    这家报纸在8日的社论中指出，印度尼西亚人民同华侨是友好的，他们不需要从华侨的鲜血中获取任何利益。它说，排华活动是直接违反印度尼西亚人民同中国人民以及华侨友好相处的愿望的。而且，可以肯定，这种活动大大地损害了万隆精神和印度尼西亚共和国的威信。
    这家报纸说，更为严重的是，在中国政府已经表示愿意友好地同印度尼西亚政府解决华侨问题并且在这方面主动采取了一些措施之后，排华活动竟然变本加厉，甚至制造流血惨案。
    “生活午报”、“湄江日报”等也都发表评论，谴责这一暴行。所有这些报纸都要求立即停止强迫华侨迁移的行动，立即惩办凶手和对死难者的家属进行抚恤。这些报纸还说，印度尼西亚当局必须保证不再发生同样事件。
    新华社仰光9日电　仰光华侨报纸“人民报”和“新仰光报”今天都发表社论，强烈抗议印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队枪杀两名华侨妇女的暴行。
      “人民报”的社论说，印度尼西亚有势力集团在全世界人民面前是无法否认血淋淋的事实，尽管他们散布谣言企图掩盖他们的罪行。
    社论说，在缅甸的三十万华侨坚决拥护中国政府的严正态度，并表示他们对印度尼西亚有势力集团指使军队枪杀华侨妇女的强烈愤慨。社论要求印度尼西亚政府“惩办凶手；抚恤死者家属；立即停止对华侨进行迫迁。”
    社论指出，印度尼西亚有势力集团发动大规模的反华活动的目的，是要破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好关系。
    “新仰光报”在题为“立即制止血手”的社论中，强烈谴责印度尼西亚有势力集团策划的罪恶活动。社论表示支持中国政府的态度和印度尼西亚华侨为保卫他们正当权利而采取的正义立场。
