    Swiftly Eliminate Weed Infestation
    By a staff commentator of this newspaper
    A few days ago, this newspaper successively published news from Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Heilongjiang and other provinces about organizing the masses to eliminate weed infestation, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture's notice regarding the elimination of weed infestation. Today, we are publishing news about the intensive weeding in Henan, Shaanxi and other regions. It seems that the issue of weeding has attracted the attention of various localities.
    Currently, the national grain production situation is very good. Most spring-sown grain crops have entered the critical period of booting, heading, or vigorous tuber growth, and summer-sown grain crops are also growing rapidly. As long as we earnestly focus on field management in the coming period, putting in more effort, there is great potential to achieve greater grain production increases in the autumn.
    At present, a very urgent task in the field management of grain crops is to swiftly eliminate weed infestation. According to reports from Heilongjiang, Liaoning and other provinces, due to frequent rains in the early stages and tight labor, weeding was not timely, and the weed-infested area accounts for about one-tenth of the farmland. In some areas of North China and the Yellow River and Huai River basins, due to the long drought, people concentrated their efforts on fighting the drought in the previous stage, and field management of spring-sown crops could not keep up in time. A portion of summer-sown crops also did not have time to eliminate stubble. Recently, after the rain, weeds have grown rapidly in many fields. Therefore, concentrating efforts to eliminate weed infestation is a very pressing task on the current grain production front.
    Spring and summer-sown grain crops are mostly cultivated crops. From the perspective of the crop's habits and growth patterns, timely cultivation and weeding are particularly necessary. The peak growth period of autumn-ripening crops is also the period of competition for various weeds. If weeds are allowed to grow in the fields, they will consume and seize the moisture and nutrients in the soil, hindering normal crop growth. In severe cases, the fields will become barren, resulting in serious yield reductions or even no harvest. "The harvest depends on the hoe." Only by completely eliminating weeds can we create more favorable growing conditions for crops and achieve a good harvest. Weeding and preventing crop diseases and insect pests are best done sooner rather than later. "One day of weeding early is better than applying fertilizer once." We should concentrate our efforts to remove weeds as soon as they emerge. Early weeding saves labor and is easy to clean up, achieving twice the result with half the effort; weeding late not only greatly affects the growth and development of crops, but also consumes labor and is more difficult to clean up, achieving half the result with twice the effort. Therefore, whether it is in areas where weed infestation has already occurred or in areas with fewer weeds, we should remove weeds whenever they appear and eliminate weeds whenever there is infestation.
    To quickly eliminate weed infestation, we must first concentrate superior forces to fight a "war of annihilation." It is understood that in some areas, there are too few laborers participating in field management, and most of them are weak laborers, so the weeding progress is very slow. This situation must be reversed quickly. Currently, it is a critical period to compete with weeds for grain. Leaders at all levels must make decisive decisions to quickly transfer the main labor force to field management, and mobilize urban residents, government cadres, and students to participate in weeding work as much as possible, concentrating efforts to eliminate weeds regularly. In late June, the Xuzhou Prefecture of Jiangsu Province concentrated more than 500,000 laborers to carry out intensive weeding work. After more than ten days of hard work, the 4 million mu of autumn-ripening crops in the entire prefecture have basically eliminated weed infestation.
    After concentrating a large number of laborers, we must do a good job in organization to ensure that all forces are used on the "blade's edge." The method is to organize the labor force according to strength, skill level, and the weed infestation situation in different crops and plots, distinguishing the priorities and making overall arrangements for what to weed first and what to weed later. This will not only use the labor force in urgently needed areas, but also speed up the weeding progress.
    The elimination of weed infestation should be combined with field management measures such as topdressing fertilizer and pest control. Immediately after weeding, topdressing fertilizer, watering, and pest control should be carried out to further promote the healthy growth of crops, so that the stalks are strong, the ears are large, and there are many grains, or the vines are strong, there are many tubers, and the tubers are large.
    Various field management measures are highly seasonal, especially weeding, which is best done as early as possible. Leaders at all levels should go deep into the front lines of production, focus on this work, quickly concentrate their efforts to eliminate weeds intensively, and at the same time, seize the other yield-increasing measures. As long as we put in the same effort as we did in grasping sowing, focus on field management, and continuously fight against various natural disasters, we will surely achieve a greater autumn grain harvest.

    迅速消灭草荒
    本报评论员
    前几天本报连续发表了山东、河北、江苏、山西、黑龙江等省组织群众消灭草荒的新闻和农业部关于消灭草荒的通知，今天又发表了河南、陕西等地区突击除草的新闻，看来除草这件事情已经引起各地重视了。
    目前全国粮食生产形势很好，春播粮食作物大部分进入孕穗、抽穗或结薯盛长的重要时期，夏播粮食作物也正在迅速生长。只要今后一段时期扎扎实实地狠抓田间管理，多下功夫，争取秋季粮食更多增产是大有可为的。
    当前，粮食作物田间管理工作中一个十分紧迫的任务，就是迅速消灭草荒。据黑龙江、辽宁等省反映，由于前期雨水勤，劳力紧，铲趟不及时，草荒面积约占农田十分之一左右。华北及黄河、淮河流域一些地区，因受旱时间长，前一阶段人们集中力量抗旱，春播作物田间管理没能及时跟上，夏播作物一部分又来不及灭茬，最近下雨后，不少田里杂草猛生。因此，集中力量，突击消灭草荒，是当前粮食生产战线上一个十分迫切的任务。
    春、夏播粮食作物多是中耕作物，从作物的习性和生长规律来看，特别需要及时进行中耕锄草。秋熟作物的生长盛期，也是各种杂草的竞生时期，如果让田间杂草滋长，轻则消耗和夺取地里的水分与养料，妨碍作物正常生长，重则使田地荒芜，造成严重减产甚至无收。“锄头底下看年成”。只有彻底消灭杂草，才能给作物创造更为有利的生长条件，才会有好收成。除草和防治作物的病虫害一样宜早不宜迟，“早锄一天草，赛追一次肥”。应当在杂草一露头的时候，就集中力量把它除掉。早除既省工，又容易除净，事半功倍；除得晚了，不仅大大影响作物的生长发育，也费工，更不易除净，事倍功半。所以，无论是已经发生草荒的地区还是草少的地区，都应该做到有草就除，有荒就灭。
    要迅速消灭草荒，首先必须要集中优势力量，打“歼灭战”。据了解，目前有些地区参加田间管理的劳动力过少，而且又多是弱劳力，锄草进度很慢，必须迅速扭转这一情况。当前正是与草争粮的关键时期，各地领导上要当机立断，把主要劳动力迅速转移到田间管理方面来，并尽可能动员城镇居民、机关干部、学生参加除草工作，集中力量，定期消灭。江苏徐州专区，在6月下旬集中了五十多万劳动力，开展突击锄草工作，经过十多天的努力，全专区四百多万亩秋熟作物已经基本消灭了草荒。
    集中了大批劳动力之后，要作好组织工作，使全部的力量都用在“刀刃”上。办法就是把劳动力按强弱、技术高低加以组织，并根据不同作物和地段的草荒情况，分出轻重缓急，先锄什么后锄什么，作出全面安排。这样既能把劳动力使用在急需要的地方，又能加快锄草进度。
    消灭草荒要和追肥、治虫等田间管理措施结合进行，除草之后就紧接着进行追肥、浇水、治虫，这样才能进一步促进作物健壮生长，达到秆壮、穗大、粒多，或蔓壮、结薯多、薯块大。
    田间管理的各项措施都有强烈的季节性，特别是除草，更是越早越好。各地领导干部要深入生产第一线，抓好这项工作，迅速集中力量突击消灭杂草，同时抓紧其他各项增产措施。只要我们拿出像抓播种那样的劲头，狠抓田间管理，不断同各种自然灾害进行斗争，一定能获得秋季粮食更大丰收。
