　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: Four million Japanese workers held short strikes and workplace rallies across the country today. At the rallies, they passed resolutions declaring non-recognition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," opposing the emergence of a Nobusuke Kishi-style government, crushing the government's suppression of the people's struggle, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.
　　The workers also submitted protest letters to the authorities concerned, protesting against the Nobusuke Kishi government's persecution of workers participating in strikes against the "Security Treaty."
　　Today's nationwide struggle by workers is part of the ongoing 21st unified action against the "Security Treaty."
　　This evening, 100,000 workers and citizens in Tokyo held demonstrations with the same goals. Demonstrators holding placards, red flags, and lanterns marched from Hibiya Park to the Diet.
　　Participating in the demonstration were workers from the national railway, postal service, telecommunications, and government employees, as well as five hundred university professors and researchers, who held a rally in front of the Diet.
　　The rally unanimously passed a resolution stating that the Japanese people want democracy, peace, and prosperity, and cannot tolerate the continuation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policies. The resolution stated that the Japanese people will fight to form a government that conforms to the people's will, abides by the constitution, and adheres to democratic principles.
　　After the meeting, participants held demonstrations in downtown Tokyo, chanting slogans such as "Dissolve the Diet," "We do not accept the Security Treaty," "We oppose the Nobusuke Kishi-style government," and "Let us defeat the suppression of the people." Countless placards were held up demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty." The demonstration continued until 9:00 PM.
　　Prior to this, approximately 1,300 representatives from various regions had already held a demonstration march from Hibiya Park to the Diet this afternoon. They also held a rally near the Diet.
　　Kozo Minaguchi, a representative of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," delivered a speech at the meeting, condemning the Liberal Democratic Party's despicable conspiracy in the presidential "election." He said, "The deepening conflicts within the ruling party prove how panicked the Liberal Democrats are in the face of the Japanese people's powerful struggle against them." He called on the participants to intensify the struggle for the dissolution of the Diet and the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
　　Socialist Party representative Toshiro Tanaka said: "Our struggle has already forced the United States to withdraw U-2 jet aircraft from Japan (mainland). We must further advance our struggle with greater force in order to eliminate all U.S. bases in Japan."
　　Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka said in his speech to the assembly, "We must demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet and hold general elections under a democratic caretaker government."
　　After the meeting, a delegation of thirty people selected by the assembly went to Nobusuke Kishi's "official residence" to request a meeting with government officials. Because this request was denied, they sat down in front of Nobusuke Kishi's official residence to hold a demonstration.
　　1,500 members of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association" met with 1,300 representatives from various regions near the Diet. Together, they held a demonstration in the streets.

    日本四百万工人罢工反对日美条约
　　东京十万人大示威要求改变岸信介政府的政策
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本四百万工人今天在全国各地举行短时间的罢工和工作场所大会，他们在大会上通过决议，宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”、反对出现岸信介式的政府，粉碎政府对人民斗争的镇压和要求解散国会。
    工人们并且向有关当局递交了抗议信，抗议岸信介政府迫害参加反对“安全条约”罢工的工人。
    工人们今天的全国性斗争是正在进行着的反对“安全条约”第二十一次统一行动的一部分。
    今天傍晚，在东京有十万工人和市民举行了同样目标的示威游行。拿着标语牌、红旗和灯笼的示威群众从日比谷公园出发前往国会。
    参加示威的国营铁道工人、邮政工人、电信工人和政府雇员以及五百位大学教授和研究工作者在国会前面举行了大会。
    大会一致通过决议指出，日本人民要民主、和平和繁荣，不能容忍岸信介内阁的政策继续下去。决议说，日本人民将为组成符合人民意愿、遵守宪法和民主原则的政府而斗争。
    会后，与会者到东京闹市举行示威，齐声高呼“解散国会”，“我们不接受安全条约”、“我们反对岸信介式的政府”和“让我们击败对人民采取的镇压行动”等口号。人们举着无数的标语牌上写着要求废除新“安全条约”。示威一直进行到晚上九点钟。
    在这以前，各地代表约一千三百人今天下午已经举行了从日比谷公园到国会去的示威游行。他们也在国会附近举行了大会。
    水口宏三代表阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议曾在会上发表演说，谴责自由民主党在总裁“选举”中的卑鄙阴谋。他说，“执政党内部加深的冲突证明，自由民主党人在日本人民反对他们的强有力的斗争面前是多么惊惶失措”。他号召与会者加紧为解散国会和废除新日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    社会党代表田中稔男说：“我们的斗争已经迫使美国把U—2喷气飞机撤出日本（本土）。我们必须进一步以更大的力量推进我们的斗争，以便取消美国在日本的所有基地。”
    共产党主席野坂参三在向大会讲话时说“我们必须要求立即解散国会，并在民主的看守政府下举行大选”。
    大会结束后，由大会选出的三十个人组成的代表团到岸信介的“官邸”去要求会见政府的负责官员。由于这个要求遭到拒绝，他们在岸信介官邸前面席地而坐举行示威。
    “安全条约批判会”的一千五百名会员同来自各地的一千三百名代表在国会附近会合。他们一起在街上举行了示威。
