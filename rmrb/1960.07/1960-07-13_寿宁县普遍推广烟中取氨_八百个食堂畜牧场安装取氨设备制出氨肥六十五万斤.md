　　Shouning County Universally Promotes Ammonia Extraction from Smoke
　　800 Canteens and Livestock Farms Install Ammonia Extraction Equipment, Producing 650,000 Jin of Ammonia Fertilizer

　　(Our Report) Fujian's Shouning County mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in ammonia extraction from smoke. All stoves in the county's 730+ canteens and 70 livestock farms have installed ammonia extraction equipment to accumulate ammonia fertilizer on a large scale. In the past six months of this year, they have already accumulated 650,700+ jin of high-quality ammonia fertilizer, averaging 3,650 jin per day, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

　　The earliest to promote ammonia extraction from smoke in Shouning County was the Nanyang Brigade of the Nanyang Commune. The brigade's cadres and members, together, used mud bricks to build a smoke cabinet above the stove in the canteen. The lower end of the smoke cabinet connected to the stove's chimney, and the upper end had an opening for ventilation and exhaust. Inside the smoke cabinet, peat or fertile soil was stacked in a "pagoda shape." The smoke from the stove passed through the chimney into the smoke cabinet, and the smoke fumes absorbed into the soil, so that the ammonia content would be absorbed. One month later, it became ammonia fertilizer. In the past, the ammonia fertilizer applied to crops in Shouning mainly relied on human and animal manure, plant ash, and cow bones. However, the amount of human manure in mountainous areas was not much, plant ash could not be burned too much, and the source of cow bones was very scarce. Therefore, the promotion of ammonia extraction from smoke has great significance for solving the shortage of ammonia fertilizer and promoting bumper harvests of crops. The Shouning County Party Committee attached great importance to the experience of the Nanyang Brigade and decided to universally promote ammonia extraction from smoke throughout the county. The County Party Committee held an on-site meeting in the Nanyang Brigade with the participation of commune party committee secretaries, chairmen, and brigade cadres to introduce the experience of ammonia extraction from smoke. After the commune representatives returned, they also set an example in one canteen, and then held on-site meetings of brigade, team, and canteen cadres, adopting the method of learning if they didn't know how, doing once they learned, and comparing once they did, to promote this fertilizer production method. In the process of promotion, party organizations at all levels carried out extensive publicity, and calculated three accounts for the masses: First, if all the stoves in the county's 800+ canteens were used for ammonia extraction from smoke, they could accumulate 1.4 million jin of high-quality ammonia fertilizer a year; second, the ammonia fertilizer extracted from smoke has very high fertilizer efficiency; third, the ammonia extraction equipment is simple, requires little labor, and has low cost. It only takes five workdays to make a smoke cabinet. Generally, new soil is replaced once a month. Not only can it ventilate and exhaust smoke as usual without affecting cooking, but it can also improve environmental sanitation. While calculating the three accounts, cadres at all levels took the lead in applying this ammonia fertilizer to their fields, educating the masses with concrete facts and enhancing their confidence.

　　In the vigorous effort to extract ammonia from smoke, party committees at all levels also strengthened specific leadership, and designated a secretary to be in charge of this work. In the Toxi and Qinyang Communes and other communes, each brigade also established an ammonia extraction from smoke leading group, led by the deputy branch secretary and deputy brigade leader, to conduct monthly inspections and evaluations to regularize ammonia extraction from smoke. Of the county's 807 canteens and 122 livestock farms, more than 730 canteens and 70 livestock farms have set up smoke cabinets to extract ammonia from smoke, implementing fixed personnel and quotas. Generally, a canteen that feeds 100 people must hand in 50 jin of high-quality ammonia fertilizer or 250 jin of general ammonia fertilizer to the production team each month, and the production team gives reasonable remuneration and bonuses for exceeding the quota. In the Kendry Commune, 13 canteens designated more than 100 cooks to manage ammonia extraction from smoke, and the Nanyang Commune adopted a method of combining the canteen director, production team leader, and cook, extracting more than 25,000 jin of ammonia fertilizer per month.

### 寿宁县普遍推广烟中取氨　八百个食堂畜牧场安装取氨设备制出氨肥六十五万斤

　　寿宁县普遍推广烟中取氨
　　八百个食堂畜牧场安装取氨设备制出氨肥六十五万斤
    本报讯　福建寿宁县发动群众大搞烟中取氨，全县七百三十多个食堂和七十个畜牧场的炉灶都安装上取氨设备，大积氨肥，今年六个月来已积优质氨肥六十五万零七百多斤，平均日产三千六百五十斤，有力地支援了农业生产。
    寿宁县最早推行烟中取氨的是南阳公社南阳大队。这个队干部和社员一起，在食堂的炉灶楼上，用泥砖砌成一个烟柜，烟柜的下端接通炉灶的烟囱，烟柜的上端开个口通风排气，烟柜内将泥炭土或肥土叠成“宝塔形”，炉灶的火烟经过烟囱通到烟柜，烟气熏在泥土上，氨份就被吸收，一个月后就成了氨肥。寿宁以往作物追施的氨肥主要靠人畜粪肥、草木灰和牛骨，但是山区人粪不多，草木灰不能多烧，牛骨来源又很缺乏，因此，推广烟中取氨对于解决氨肥不足，促进农作物丰收具有重大意义。中共寿宁县委很重视南阳大队的这个经验，决定在全县普遍推广烟中取氨。县委在南阳大队召开了有公社党委书记、社长，以及大队干部参加的现场会议，介绍烟中取氨的经验，各公社代表回去后，也在一个食堂作出榜样，然后召开大队、小队和食堂干部的现场会，采取不会就学，学了就干，干了就比的方法，推广这一制肥方法。在推广过程中，各级党的组织开展广泛的宣传，向群众算三笔账：第一，全县八百多个食堂的炉灶都进行烟中取氨，一年就能积优质氨肥一百四十万斤；第二，烟中取出的氨肥，肥效很高；第三，烟中取氨设备简单，花工少成本低，做一个烟柜只要五个劳动日，一般是一个月更换新土一次，不但可以照常通风排烟不会影响煮饭，而且还可以搞好环境卫生。在算三笔账的同时，各级干部带头施用这种氨肥肥田，以具体事实教育群众，提高群众信心。
    在大搞烟中取氨中，各级党委还加强具体领导，确定了一个书记抓这项工作。托溪、芹洋等公社各个大队还以支部副书记、副大队长为主成立烟中取氨领导小组，每月检查评比一次，使烟中取氨经常化。全县八百零七个食堂和一百二十二个畜牧场，有七百三十多个食堂和七十个畜牧场，都设立烟柜进行烟中取氨，实行定员定额，一般一百人吃饭的食堂，每个月要向生产队交优质氨肥五十斤，一般氨肥二百五十斤，由生产队给予合理报酬，超额奖励。坑底公社十三个食堂确定了一百多个炊事员管理烟中取氨，南阳公社采取食堂主任、生产队长、炊事员三结合的办法，每月取氨肥二万五千多斤。
