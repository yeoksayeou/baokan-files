The staff and worker spare-time education is in a great situation of great development, great popularization, and great improvement. A key problem before us is to vigorously carry out teaching reform in order to continue the leap forward and achieve greater achievements. We can see this from the examples of significant achievements made by factories and enterprises in Taiyuan City, as well as Tianjin Electrical Factory, Xiangjiang Machine Tool Factory and other production units in running staff and worker spare-time education.

However, some people believe that staff and worker spare-time education is a new set of education. It was established by us in the development of production, unlike full-time general education which is influenced by a set of bourgeois education systems. Therefore, the teaching reform of staff and worker spare-time education is not an urgent problem to be solved. It should be admitted that staff and worker spare-time education was indeed established by us with the development of production, and it is indeed less affected by bourgeois educational thought and educational system than full-time schools. However, precisely because it is newly established, there are still many problems in teaching. In some places, even the entire set of educational systems of full-time general education has been copied. These all need to be carefully reformed. We are believers in continuous revolution. We cannot be satisfied with existing achievements. We should constantly innovate teaching and move forward with the development of production.

In the situation of rapid industrial production and rapidly changing production innovation, workers are eager to learn new scientific and technological knowledge, so that they can carry out more complex technological innovation and technological revolution work. Measured by this standard, the existing academic system, curriculum, teaching content, and teaching methods of staff and worker spare-time education cannot meet this requirement. From the perspective of the original academic system, the length of study is too long. Some workers reflect, "The old academic system is a pit, rising step by step, primary and secondary school for more than ten years, graduation has become an old man." This description vividly illustrates the urgency of carrying out teaching reform in staff and worker spare-time education. In terms of textbook content and curriculum, since many are copied from the full-time general education system, there are many outdated things, which are divorced from production practice, do not reflect or rarely reflect the content of new scientific and technological achievements, and there are also many contents that are not necessary for adults at all. All these show that the teaching reform of staff and worker spare-time education is imperative.

The teaching reform of staff and worker spare-time education, like the teaching reform of general education, also involves the struggle between two ideologies and two methods. To reform, we must first go through ideological struggle. Only through such a struggle can we carry out a comprehensive and thorough reform. In the reform, on the one hand, we must break superstitions, emancipate our minds, and boldly create various reform plans with a revolutionary spirit; on the other hand, we must be cautious, and everything must be tested, repeatedly investigated and studied, and carried out on a solid basis. We must earnestly implement the principle of "combining production, unified arrangement, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity" according to the needs of production and the actual learning situation of workers, and find out the correct reform plan from it. In the process of reform, under the leadership of the Party, we must resolutely implement the mass line and mobilize workers and engineering and technical personnel to participate together. In this way, we can absorb opinions from all parties and formulate a relatively complete teaching reform plan, so that staff and worker spare-time education can better serve politics and production, train technical talents from workers more, faster, better, and more economically, and promote the continuous development of technological innovation and technological revolution.

    职工教育教学改革势在必行
    萧柏
    职工业余教育正处在大发展、大普及、大提高的大好形势下，摆在面前的一个关键问题，就是要大力进行教学改革，以便继续跃进，取得更大的成就。我们从太原市工厂企业，以及天津电器厂、湘江机器厂等生产单位大办职工业余教育取得显著成绩的实例中，就可以看到这一点。
    可是，有些人认为：职工业余教育是一套新的教育，它是我们在生产发展中办起来的，不像全日制普通教育受着资产阶级一套教育制度的影响，因此，职工业余教育的教学改革，并不是什么迫切需要解决的问题。应该承认，职工业余教育是我们随着生产发展办起来的，它的确比全日制学校所受的资产阶级教育思想和教育制度的影响要少些。但是，也正因为是新办起来的，在教学上还存在着不少问题，有的地方甚至是把全日制普通教育的教育制度一整套照搬过来。这些都需要认真地加以改革。我们是不断革命论者，不能只满足已有的成绩，应该随着生产的发展，不断革新教学，不断前进。
    在工业生产一日千里，生产革新日新月异的形势下，工人迫切要求学习新的科学技术知识，从而能进行更复杂的技术革新技术革命工作。以这个标准来衡量，职工业余教育现有的学制、课程设置、教学内容、教学方法都不能适应这个要求。从原有的学制上来看，学习年限过长，有些工人反映说：“旧的学制把人坑，按部就班往上升，大中小学十几年，毕业已成白头翁。”工人的这个形容，生动地说出了职工业余教育必须进行教学改革的迫切性。在教材内容上以及课程设置上，由于许多都是生搬普通教育的一套，因此有不少陈旧落后的东西，脱离生产实际，没有或很少反映新的科学技术成就的内容，也有不少是对成年人根本不必要的内容。这些都说明了，职工业余教育的教学改革是势在必行的。
    职工业余教育的教学改革，和普通教育的教学改革一样，同样存在着两种思想、两种方法的斗争。要改，一定先要经过思想斗争。只有经过这样的斗争，才能全面彻底地进行改革。在改革中，一方面要破除迷信，解放思想，以革命精神，大胆创造各种改革方案；另一方面，一定要慎重，一切要经过试验，要反复调查研究，要在踏踏实实的基础上进行。要根据生产需要和工人学习的实际情况认真贯彻“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的原则，从中找出正确的改革方案。在改革过程中，要在党的领导下，坚决贯彻群众路线，发动工人、工程技术人员一起参加。这样，才能吸收各方面的意见，制订出一套比较完整的教学改革方案，使职工业余教育能够更好地为政治为生产服务，多快好省地从工人中培养技术人材，促进技术革新和技术革命的不断发展。
