    Use Active Production to Strike at U.S. Imperialism
    To protest the American aggressor chieftain Eisenhower's gangster trip to Asia and strike at the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, members of our commune expressed their determination to wage war against the wasteland and fertilize the seedlings with the same vigor as the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front shelling "the god of plague". The 300 members of the Jiuduhe Production Brigade were divided into hoeing, fertilizing, and transplanting teams. During the days of the "god of plague" Eisenhower's gangster trip to Asia, the members overfulfilled their tasks every day. The brigade's 7,000 mu of farmland was originally scheduled to be hoed twice in twelve days, but it was completed in eight days. By June 26, all 39,000 mu of large seedlings in the commune had been transplanted and hoed once. 22,000 mu had been hoed twice, and 10,000 mu had been fertilized.

    用积极生产的行动打击美帝国主义
    我们公社的社员为了抗议美国侵略头子艾森豪威尔到亚洲的强盗旅行，打击美帝国主义的侵略政策，社员们表示以福建前线解放军炮击“瘟神”的劲头，向荒地开战，给禾苗追肥。九渡河生产大队三百名社员，分成锄地、追肥、移苗等战斗小组，在瘟神艾森豪威尔到亚洲作强盗旅行的日子里，社员们天天超额完成任务。全大队七千亩大田，原定用十二天时间锄完二遍，结果八天就完成了。到6月26日全社三万九千亩大苗全部定完苗，并锄完了头遍。有二万二千亩锄完了二遍，有一万亩追上了肥。
