Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 8th July: The autumn field sowing work in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has entered its final stage. People's communes in various places are seizing the opportunity to continue to rush plant and increase the planting of various late-autumn crops.

This year, under the guidance of the principle of planting more high-yielding and high-yield crops, Ningxia has paid attention to increasing and expanding planting in autumn field sowing. The autonomous region and the people's communes in various counties (cities) have established production headquarters centered on rushing and increasing planting, deploying troops and generals, and allocating seeds for rushing planting. Some counties and cities have even moved their offices to the fields, with cadres going to the front line to rush planting with commune members. The Guyuan area in the southern mountainous area organized an inspection team of more than 3,000 people to carry out large-scale inspections and competitions in various places to promote the final victory of the sowing work. By the end of June, counties such as Longde, Jingyuan, and Haiyuan had completed their sowing plans. Some farms and people's communes in the Nihe Irrigation Area of Haiyuan County, due to insufficient water, failed to plant rice in time, and decisively changed to planting millet, buckwheat and other autumn miscellaneous grain crops.

At present, the summer harvest work in the autonomous region has begun. In addition to continuing to rush plant autumn fields, the counties and cities in the northern Yellow River irrigation area are actively carrying out replanting work after the summer harvest. The southern and eastern mountainous areas are still continuing to rush plant autumn fields.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Hubei Province is seizing the opportunity to summer sow sesame, the province's main oil crop. Xiangyang Prefecture, which has a faster progress, had completed 90% of its sesame planting plan by June 21.

Various places have adopted the methods of reclaiming wasteland and seizing every opportunity to expand the sesame planting area by every possible means. Changyang County used cornfields to interplant sesame, and the planting area was nearly doubled compared with the plan. After completing the sesame planting plan, the Zhuhe Commune in Jianli County used embankments, grave slopes, pond edges, and ditch edges to carry out large-scale sesame transplanting, transplanting more than 400 mu in just two days.

While expanding the planting area, various places have paid special attention to the quality of sowing. Many areas have implemented methods such as assigning special leaders, organizing professional teams for labor, and using special fertilizers to ensure the quality of sowing. The Cihua Commune in Dangyang County fixed more than 1,800 laborers to form 302 professional groups, led by the deputy captains of each production team, and allocated 500,000 dan of special fertilizer to ensure that sesame was planted quickly and well. Xiangyang County, which accounts for about 15% of the province's sesame planting area, this year, on the basis of summarizing past sesame high-yield experience, proposed technical reforms such as changing to good varieties, changing shallow plowing to deep plowing, changing broadcasting to strip sowing, changing no base fertilizer to universal base fertilizer, and changing late stubble to early stubble. The sesame that has been sown has generally achieved uniform sowing, sufficient fertilizer, and reasonable close planting.

While rushing to plant, various places also emphasized planting and management at the same time. 200,000 mu of sesame that were planted earlier in Xiangyang County have generally weeded one or two times and have set the seedlings. While rushing to plant, the Cihua Commune in Dangyang County organized more than 500 laborers to invest in field management of seedling inspection, replanting and weeding.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Anhui Province has almost completed the planting plan for oil crops such as soybeans, sesame, and peanuts. Counties that have not completed the plan are actively rushing to plant, and counties and people's communes that have completed the plan are adopting interplanting and intercropping methods to expand the planting of oil crops as much as possible.

While harvesting summer crops, party committees in various parts of Anhui Province strengthened their leadership over the planting of oil crops, mobilized the masses, and made full use of the stubble, gaps, and rows of tall-stalked and creeping crops to plant various oil crops. After nearly completing the oil crop planting plan, various places in the Fuyang area responded to the call of the prefectural party committee and launched a hot tide of expanding soybean planting on ridges and sesame intercropping in dry food fields. Each commune combined dry land weeding and interplanted sesame in all short-stalked and creeping crop fields. Now, 2 million mu of sesame and soybeans have been interplanted and intercropped, an increase of 57% compared with the original planned planting area. The communes in Chuxian County universally used newly reclaimed wasteland and scattered plots to expand the planting of oil crops, and combined with field management, interplanted in sweet potato, corn, cotton, and pumpkin fields, making the oil crop planting area more than doubled than the original plan. In addition to organizing professional teams for planting, various parts of Quanjiao County mobilized commune members to use the gaps in weeding, farming, and early and late hours to plant, and now they have planted more than 30,000 mu of sesame. The Liu'an area dug deep into the potential of the land and expanded the planting area of oil crops. According to statistics on July 2, the area has planted 1,096,000 mu of oil crops such as sesame, soybeans, and peanuts, exceeding the planting plan. The vast number of cadres and masses in the area are advancing victoriously, using all available land to continue to vigorously expand planting. According to statistics from only four counties of Shou County, Jinzhai, Lujiang, and Liu'an, more than 237,000 mu of oil crops have been planted by using newly reclaimed wasteland, houses, roadsides, field ridges, and crop rows. Of the 46,000 mu of oil crops that have been planted in Huoqiu County, 37,000 mu are planted in pieces using the dikes of the Pi-Shi-Hang irrigation canal. Under the slogan of "finding gaps to insert needles, not wasting every inch of land, planting whatever can be planted, planting more and harvesting more," the Hero Commune in Jinzhai County used vacant land and crop rows to plant and intercrop 3,520 mu of sesame, exceeding 50% of the oil crop planting plan.

    宁夏继续抢种各种晚秋杂粮
    湖北安徽千方百计套种间种油料作物
    新华社银川8日电　宁夏回族自治区的秋田播种工作已经进入最后阶段。各地人民公社正在抓紧时机，继续抢种、增种各种晚秋作物。
    今年宁夏各地在多种高收与高产多收的方针指导下，在秋田播种工作中注意了增种、扩种。自治区和各县（市）人民公社都成立了以抢种、增种为中心的生产指挥部，调兵遣将，调剂籽种进行抢种。有些县市还把办公室搬到田间，干部亲赴第一线，同社员一起抢种。南部山区的固原专区组织三千多人的检查团，到各地开展大检查、大评比，促进播种工作最后胜利。到6月下旬，隆德、泾源、海原等县都已完成了播种计划。海原县霓河灌区有些农场和人民公社，因水量不足，没有及时种上水稻，也当机立断，改种了糜子、荞麦等秋杂粮作物。
    现在，自治区夏收工作已经开始。北部黄河灌区各县市当前除继续抢种秋田外，正在积极进行夏收后的复种工作。南部和东部山区，仍在继续抢种秋田。
    据新华社讯　湖北省各地正在抓紧时机夏播本省主要油料作物芝麻。进度较快的襄阳专区，到6月21日止已完成芝麻种植计划90％。
    各地采取开荒和见缝插针的办法，千方百计扩大芝麻种植面积。长阳县利用苞谷地套种芝麻，播种面积比计划扩大了近一倍。监利县朱河公社在完成芝麻播种计划后，又利用堤坡、坟坡、塘边、沟边大搞芝麻移栽，仅两天中就移栽四百多亩。
    各地在扩大播种面积的同时，特别注意播种质量。不少地区推行了领导专人负责、劳力组织专业队和专用肥料等办法，来保证播种质量。当阳县慈化公社固定一千八百多个劳力，组成三百零二个专业组，由各生产队副队长领导，并且拨出专用肥料五十万担，使芝麻种得又快又好。占全省芝麻种植面积15％左右的襄阳县，今年在总结过去芝麻丰产经验的基础上，提出改换良种、改浅耕为深耕、改撒播为条播、改不施底肥为普遍施底肥、改晚茬为早茬等技术改革，已播的芝麻一般做到了匀播、肥足、合理密植。
    各地在抢播同时，还强调边种边管。襄阳县播得较早的二十万亩芝麻已普遍锄了一道到两道草，并且已定好苗。当阳县慈化公社一边抢种，一边组织五百多劳力投入查苗补种和锄草定苗的田间管理。
    据新华社讯　安徽省黄豆、芝麻、花生等油料作物已接近完成播种计划。未完成计划的县，正在积极抢种，已完成计划的县和人民公社，正在采取套种、间种的办法尽量扩种油料作物。
    安徽省各地党委在夏收同时，就加强了对油料作物种植的领导，发动群众，利用腾出的茬口、空隙地以及高秆、蔓生作物地的行间，大种各种油料作物。阜阳专区在接近完成油料作物播种计划后，各地又响应地委号召，掀起了田埂种黄豆、旱粮地间种芝麻的扩种热潮。各个公社结合旱地锄草，在所有短秆、蔓生作物地里套种芝麻，现在已套种间种芝麻和黄豆两百万亩，比原计划播种面积扩大57％。滁县各公社普遍利用新垦荒地，零星地扩种油料作物，并结合田间管理，在山芋、玉米、棉花、南瓜地里套种，使油料作物播种面积比原计划扩大一倍多。全椒县各地除了组织专业队播种以外，还发动社员利用锄田、耕田、早晚空隙时间播种，现已播种芝麻三万多亩。六安专区大挖土地潜力，扩大油料作物播种面积，到7月2日统计，全区已播种芝麻、黄豆、花生等油料作物一百零九万六千亩，超额完成了播种计划。全区广大干部、群众正乘胜前进，利用一切可以利用的土地继续大力扩种。仅据寿县、金寨、庐江、六安四个县的统计，就利用新垦荒地、家前屋后、路旁、田埂地边和作物行间播种油料作物二十三万七千多亩。霍丘县已种的四万六千亩油料作物，就有三万七千多亩是利用淠史杭灌溉渠堤埂成片种植的。金寨县英雄公社在“找缝插针，寸土不闲，有种就种，多种多收”的口号下，利用空隙地和作物行间，单种和套种、间种芝麻三千五百二十亩，超额50％完成了油料种植计划。
