Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 25th: The tenth National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association successfully concluded today. The convention passed resolutions, declarations, and this year's activity guidelines.

The convention declaration expressed the association's determination to fight for a comprehensive resolution of Japan-China issues. The declaration stated: "We will strengthen our joint struggle with the Chinese people and crush the U.S.-Japan military alliance. We will realize the normalization of Japan-China diplomatic relations."

The convention resolution demanded the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The resolution stated that the Japan-China friendship movement would concentrate its efforts on this task: that is, to combine the movement against the "Security Treaty" with the movement to strive for Japan-China friendship in order to strengthen and expand the national united front. The resolution emphasized that this movement must strengthen its ties with the people of China and other Asian countries, the people of Latin America, and the people of Africa.

Another resolution protested the Japanese government's suppression of participants in the movement against the "Security Treaty," demanding the immediate cessation of all repressive measures against the people and the dissolution of the Diet.

The resolution regarding the upcoming general election stipulated that the Japan-China Friendship Association would launch activities to ensure that as many candidates as possible who actively demand the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are elected. The resolution stated: "The association will begin a propaganda campaign to expose the relationship between the Security Treaty and Japan's policy of hostility towards China."

The convention also passed a resolution expressing the association's support for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, to be held in Tokyo on August 2nd. The resolution stated that the association wholeheartedly welcomed delegations from China and other Asian countries to participate in the conference.

The activity guidelines adopted by the convention emphasized the need to develop the association's various cultural activities to meet public demand and to shatter anti-China propaganda.

The activity guidelines stated that the association should further develop the movement to excavate the remains of Chinese people killed in Japan during the war and complete reports on those killed. The guidelines stated that the association should demand that the government take concrete steps to apologize for the brutal treatment of the Chinese people.

In discussing organizational issues, the guidelines stated that the association's membership should double within a year. The guidelines called on all branches of the association to actively recruit new members, especially worker members.

The convention also passed letters to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The letter to the Chinese people expressed gratitude for the Chinese people's support of the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

Speaking at today's closing session were Masakatsu Nohara, a Liberal Democratic Party member and chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association's Iwate branch, and Akira Kazami, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations.

The convention elected the association's leadership. Jiichirō Matsumoto was re-elected as chairman, and Yoshitaro Hirano, Natsu Kawasaki, Isamu Ōta, Fukutarō Tamura, and Kazuo Mishima were elected as vice-chairmen. The convention also elected fifty standing directors.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 25th: Approximately one thousand members and supporters of the Japanese Communist Party held a rally in Tokyo tonight to protest the government's suppression of the Communist Party. The Japanese government had invaded the Communist Party's offices and arrested Communist Party members on charges of participating in a demonstration held at the airport on June 10th against the visit of U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty to Japan.

Sanzō Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and Shōichi Kasuga, member of the Presidium, spoke at the rally.

The protest resolution adopted by the rally pointed out that the suppression of the Communist Party should be seen as a suppression aimed at all democratic forces that had participated in the movement against the "Security Treaty."

The resolution condemned the government's dispatch of police to invade the Communist Party's offices and arrest Hiroshi Hasegawa and other Communist Party members.

The resolution demanded the immediate release of those arrested on charges of participating in the demonstration against U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty and the cessation of suppression of participants in the movement against the "Security Treaty."

After the rally, all the participants marched to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to protest the attack on the Communist Party.

    日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三和干部会委员春日正一在会上讲话。
    大会通过的抗议决议指出，对共产党的镇压应该被看作是针对曾经参加反对“安全条约”运动的所有民主力量的镇压。
    决议谴责政府派遣警察侵入共产党的办事处和逮捕长谷川浩等共产党员。
    决议要求立即释放用参加反对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的示威的罪名逮捕的人和不再镇压反对“安全条约”运动的参加者。
    大会结束后，所有的与会者游行到东京都警视厅，抗议对共产党的进攻。
