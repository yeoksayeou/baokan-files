Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - Since the end of June, North Vietnam has launched a massive mass movement against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique. In this mass movement, the broad masses of the people of North Vietnam angrily denounced the most ferocious enemy in the world – U.S. imperialism's aggression and war conspiracies, strongly condemned the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo group in South Vietnam, supported the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S.-Ngo group, and voiced their solidarity with the anti-U.S. struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, and the world.

    From Lang Son in the north to the 17th parallel in the south; from cities to vast rural areas; from workers, peasants, government cadres, students, to people from all walks of life, rallies and marches denouncing U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique have been held continuously since June 29. According to incomplete statistics, as of July 12, the number of participants in rallies and marches has reached 1,257,000. Among them, 200,000 people participated in a demonstration held in Hanoi on July 3.

    Those who participated in these rallies and marches angrily condemned U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique for continuously undermining the Geneva Accords in the six years since the signing of the Geneva Accords, obstructing Vietnamese reunification, and turning South Vietnam into a U.S. military base. They shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism!", "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of South Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan!", and "Repeal the Fascist Law No. 10 of 1959!".

    Cadres and people gathered from South Vietnam held a rally in Hanoi on July 2, strongly condemning the U.S.-Ngo group for ravaging their homeland and massacring their parents and siblings. On July 6, 1,400 religious figures from Buddhism, Catholicism, Cao Dai, and Christianity in Hanoi also held a rally, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique for persecuting patriotic religious people in South Vietnam and turning churches and temples in South Vietnam into bunkers, as well as demolishing temples everywhere and persecuting patriotic religious people.

    During this period, people from all walks of life wrote thousands of protest letters to the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, strongly condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission drive the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" out of South Vietnam and revoke its erroneous conclusion on the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem's Fascist Law No. 10 of 1959. In the Hong Quang mining area alone, more than 334 protest letters condemning the U.S.-Ngo group were written in early July, and 17,000 signatures were collected against the U.S.-Ngo group. Mass organizations such as literary and artistic groups, women's groups, and youth groups also issued letters to international youth, women's, and cultural organizations, requesting them to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    While holding rallies and marches, cultural workers in various places used various literary and artistic activities to expose to the broad masses the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo group in expanding their military and suppressing the people. Various street districts in Hanoi also held poetry creation competitions, theatrical performances, film screenings, organized exhibitions, broadcasts, and other propaganda activities against U.S. imperialism.

    In this mass movement, workers and peasants in various parts of North Vietnam put forward the slogan of turning anger into strength and vigorously launched labor emulation campaigns to strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique with practical actions to increase production. On July 13, the Vietnamese Competition Movement Committee issued a call to workers, peasants, intellectual workers, cadres, and People's Army troops in North Vietnam, requesting everyone to enthusiastically participate in the "Anti-U.S.-Ngo Labor Week" from July 14 to July 20 in order to oppose the U.S.-Ngo group. Currently, this movement is being vigorously launched in various factories and regions. The female workers of the Nam Dinh Textile Factory also launched a campaign of "Oppose the U.S.-Ngo, Weave More Cloth," which has led to continuous breakthroughs in the factory's production targets. Peasants in Phu Tho Province launched a twenty-day "Anti-U.S. Production Labor" movement starting from July 1. People in various parts of Thanh Hoa Province have successively launched "Anti-U.S.-Ngo Production Labor Competitions," seizing the season to sow and strive for a bumper late rice harvest.

　　支持南方同胞的斗争　谴责美吴集团的罪行
　　越南北方一百二十五万人参加反美示威
    据新华社河内16日电　越南北方从6月底以来，展开了声势浩大的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的群众运动。在这个群众运动中，越南北方广大人民愤怒斥责全世界最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋，并且强烈谴责美—吴集团在南越的罪行，支持南越人民的反美吴集团的斗争，并且声援南朝鲜、日本和全世界人民的反美斗争。
    北起谅山，南至十七度分界线；从城市到广大农村；从工人、农民、机关干部、学生以至各界人士，从6月29日起，连续举行声讨美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的集会和游行。据不完全统计，截至7月12日，参加集会和游行的已达到一百二十五万七千人。其中参加7月3日在河内举行的一次游行示威的就达二十万人。
    参加这些集会和游行的人们都愤怒地谴责美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团在签订日内瓦协议以后的六年中不断破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南统一和把南越变成美国军事基地的滔天罪行。他们高声呼着“打倒美帝国主义！”、“美帝国主义从南越、从南朝鲜、从台湾、从日本滚出去！”和“取消1959年第十号法西斯法令！”等口号。
    南越集结干部和人民7月2日在河内举行集会，强烈谴责美吴集团蹂躏他们的家乡，屠杀他们的父母兄弟。7月6日，河内一千四百名佛教徒、天主教、高台教和基督教等宗教界人士也举行集会，强烈谴责美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团迫害南越爱国教民和把南越的教堂、寺院变成碉堡以及到处拆毁寺庙迫害爱国教民的罪行。
    在这期间，各界人民写了成千封的抗议书交给越南国际委员会，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳在南越犯下的滔天罪行，要求国际委员会把“美国军事援助顾问团”赶出南越，撤销它对“美国军事援助顾问团”和卖国贼吴庭艳的1959年第十号法西斯法令作出的错误结论。仅仅鸿广矿区一地，7月初就写了三百三十四份谴责美吴集团的抗议书，并且征集了一万七千人反对美吴集团的签名。文艺、妇女、青年等群众团体并发出了给国际青年、妇女和文化组织的信件，要求它们声援越南人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。
    在举行集会和游行的同时，各地的文化工作者通过各种文艺活动向广大群众揭露了美吴集团扩军备战和镇压人民的罪行，河内市各街区还举办了诗歌创作比赛、演剧、放电影、组织展览广播等反对美帝国主义的宣传活动。
    在这个群众运动中，越南北方各地工人、农民提出了化愤怒为力量的口号，大力开展了劳动竞赛，以增加生产的实际行动来加强反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的斗争。越南竞赛运动委员会7月13日向北方工人、农民、脑力劳动者、干部和人民军部队发出号召，为了反对美吴集团，要求每个人都热烈参加从7月14日到7月20日的“反对美吴劳动周”。目前，这个运动正在各工厂、各地热烈展开。南定纺织厂的女工还展开了“反美吴，多织布”的运动，使这个厂的生产指标不断突破。富寿省的农民从7月1日起发动了一个为期二十天的“反美生产劳动”运动。清化省各地人民纷纷展开了“反对美吴生产劳动竞赛”，抓紧季节下地播种，争取晚稻丰收。
