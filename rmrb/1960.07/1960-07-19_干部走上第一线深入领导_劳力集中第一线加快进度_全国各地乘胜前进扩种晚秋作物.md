Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Guided by the thought of taking agriculture as the foundation and focusing on agriculture first, all parts of the country are vigorously grasping agricultural production. At present, many regions are concentrating leadership and labor, seizing the season, seizing the time, and making a concentrated effort to rush-plant late autumn crops, and are trying every possible means to expand the planting area, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

According to information from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of July 10, the summer planting across the country has completed more than half of the plan, and the summer planting work in some areas has entered the final stage. Most areas are continuing to rush-plant victoriously. Areas north of the Yangtze River are striving to complete or over fulfill the summer planting plan before the Great Heat (July 23), and areas south of the Yangtze River are striving to complete or over fulfill the summer planting plan before the Beginning of Autumn (August 7).

This year, all regions have first focused on the sowing of grain crops in summer planting. More than 100 million mu of summer coarse grains and more than 60 million mu of summer sweet potatoes have been planted nationwide. Henan and Shaanxi provinces have basically completed the summer coarse grain sowing plan, and Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces have also completed about 80% of the summer coarse grain sowing task. The transplanting of single-season late rice in the south has basically ended. With the harvesting of early rice, the transplanting of double-season late rice is about to enter a busy period. At present, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, southern Hunan, southern Zhejiang, and southern Jiangxi are harvesting early rice while transplanting late rice. Guangdong Province had transplanted 2.9 million mu by the 10th.

The sowing of oil crops, soybeans and sesame are progressing faster. More than 50 million mu of summer-sown soybeans and more than 8 million mu of sesame have been planted nationwide. Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces in the Yellow River and Huai River basins have all over fulfilled the summer soybean sowing plan.

The leadership of this year's summer planting work has been greatly strengthened compared with previous years. Many regions are concentrating leadership and major labor forces to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, striving for more planting and more harvesting. In Shandong Province, secretaries at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels took command in the rush planting, organizing more than one million cadres to participate in production and lead production on the front line of production. Special attention was paid to grasping weak areas and weak links, carrying forward the party's fine traditions, and going wherever there were difficulties, thus greatly inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the masses and powerfully promoting the summer planting work. In Shanxi Province, thanks to the first secretaries of party organizations at all levels taking command and party members and cadres taking the lead, the progress of summer planting has been greatly accelerated. Shandong, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces have made overall arrangements for labor in all walks of life, and generally concentrated 80% of the labor force on the front line of agricultural production. Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have transferred manpower and materials from all walks of life to support rush planting.

Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guangxi and other provinces and regions encountered severe drought during summer planting. Under the leadership of the Party, the people in drought-stricken areas devoted themselves to fighting drought and rushing to plant. Henan, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces first ensured that the land with water sources was well planted, striving for a bumper harvest. Areas lacking water sources also tried every possible means to fight drought and rush to plant. This summer, many areas have been expanding planting, interplanting, and intercropping based on the spirit of planting whatever can be planted. Shandong Province alone has implemented intercropping and intercropping on more than 11 million mu of summer-sown crops; after the rain, more than 600,000 people were mobilized in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, to replant all the land that was short of seedlings due to drought in the previous period.

　　干部走上第一线深入领导　劳力集中第一线加快进度
　　全国各地乘胜前进扩种晚秋作物
    新华社18日讯　全国各地在以农业为基础，首先抓农业的思想指导下，大抓农业生产。目前许多地区集中领导力量，集中劳力，抢季节，抢时间，突击抢种晚秋作物，并千方百计扩大种植面积，力争秋季丰收。
    据从农业部了解，截至7月10日止，全国各地的夏种已完成计划一半以上，部分地区的夏种工作已进入扫尾阶段，大部地区还在乘胜继续抢种，长江以北力争在大暑（7月23日）前、长江以南力争在立秋（8月7日）前完成或超额完成夏种计划。
    今年各地在夏种中都首先大抓粮食作物的播种工作。全国已种下夏杂粮一亿多亩，栽夏甘薯六千多万亩。河南、陕西两省已基本完成了夏杂粮播种计划，山东、河北、山西三省的夏杂粮播种任务也完成了80％左右。南方的一季晚稻插秧工作基本结束，随着早稻的收割，双季晚稻的插秧即将进入大忙。目前广东、广西、福建和湖南南部、浙江南部、江西南部等地都边收早稻边插晚稻，广东省到10日已插秧二百九十万亩。
    油料作物的播种，大豆和芝麻进度较快。全国夏播的大豆已种五千多万亩，芝麻已种八百多万亩。黄河淮河流域的河南、山东、江苏、安徽四省都超额完成了夏大豆的播种计划。
    今年夏种工作的领导比往年大大加强。许多地区集中领导力量，集中主要劳力，加强农业生产第一线，力争多种多收。山东省在抢种中，省、地、县、社各级都由书记挂帅，组织一百多万干部到生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产，特别注意抓薄弱地区和薄弱环节，发扬党的优良传统，那里有困难就到那里去，因而大大鼓舞了群众的劳动积极性，有力地推动了夏种工作。山西省由于各级党组织第一书记挂帅，党员、干部带头，大大加快了夏种进度。山东、四川、江西、福建等省统筹安排各行各业劳力，一般都把80％的劳力集中到农业生产第一线。河南、河北、陕西、安徽、江苏等省各行各业都抽调了人力、物力支援抢种。
    河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西、广西等省区，在夏种中曾遇到了严重的干旱。受旱地区的人民在党的领导下，全力投入了抗旱抢种。河南、河北、山东等省首先保证把有水源条件的土地种好，力争大丰收，水源缺乏的地区，也千方百计抗旱抢种。最近华北受旱的地区相继落雨，这些地区都趁雨趁墒突击抢种，未落雨或落雨不足的地区，仍继续抗旱抢种。今夏许多地区都本着能种什么就种什么的精神大搞扩种、间种、套种，仅山东省就有一千一百多万亩夏播作物实行了间作套种；河南省南阳专区雨后出动六十多万人，把前一时期因旱缺苗的土地全部补种上了。
