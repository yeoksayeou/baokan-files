    The Brilliant Victory of the Proletarian Worldview
    —Reflections on the Shanghai Opera "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky"
    Worker of Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, Fan Jianzhong
    Can chicken feathers fly to the sky? There are two different views on this issue. Some people believe that chicken feathers absolutely cannot fly to the sky, while we believe that chicken feathers can fly to the sky under certain conditions!
    These two opposing views constitute a sharp contradiction and also trigger a fierce struggle. Who will win? The Shanghai People's Opera Troupe's performance of "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" gives us the best conclusion.
    The protagonist of the play, Lin Peifen, is a staunch proletarian fighter with a sincere heart dedicated to serving the people and wholeheartedly wanting to run the people's school well. However, Gu Huizhen, a member of the bourgeois family, deliberately created obstacles and poured cold water on the matter of running the people's school, and asserted that chicken feathers could not fly to the sky and that the people's school would definitely not be run well. But these rumors did not shake Lin Peifen's determination to run the people's school; on the contrary, they strengthened her resolve. Lin Peifen said it well: "Don't argue with words, but strive for achievement, and be sure to make chicken feathers fly to the sky." This is a good spirit, it is not a matter of personal pride, but a matter of the proletarian ambition! Precisely because of this ambition, Lin Peifen was able to advance tenaciously on the rugged road, teach the naughty student Hu Rong well, run the people's school well, and make the chicken feathers fly to the sky.
    Lin Peifen's deep class feelings moved every audience member. When the naughty Hu Rong spat on her face and was ridiculed by Gu Huizhen, she did not complain at all, but only felt sad that she had not completed the task assigned by the Party. "A mouthful of spit is a small matter, Peifen doesn't act childish... But what Teacher Gu said clearly despises the children of the working class... Run the people's school well, try every means to help Hu Rong correct his shortcomings, and make him an outstanding child of the working class, be sure to make chicken feathers fly to the sky!" This passage of allegro expresses her full of enthusiasm and demonstrates her clear stance, viewpoint, and deep class feelings. It is precisely based on this viewpoint and this feeling that a strong sense of career and responsibility arises. Under her patient education, help, and enlightenment, Xiao Hu Rong finally recognized his mistakes and corrected his shortcomings. Chicken feathers ride the east wind straight up to the ninth heaven, greatly enhancing the ambition of the proletariat. Gu Huizhen's worldview was subjected to due criticism.

    无产阶级世界观的光辉胜利
    ——沪剧《鸡毛飞上天》观后感
    杨浦棉纺织印染厂工人　范建中
    鸡毛能不能飞上天？对这个问题有两种不同的看法。有人认为鸡毛绝对飞不上天，我们则认为鸡毛在一定的条件下能够飞上天！
    这两种对立的看法构成了尖锐的矛盾，也引起了激烈的斗争。到底谁胜谁负呢？人民沪剧团演出的《鸡毛飞上天》给我们作出了最好的结论。
    剧中主人公林佩芬，是一个意志坚强的无产阶级战士，她有一颗为人民服务的、赤诚的心，全心全意要办好民校；而资产阶级家属顾惠珍却对办民校这件事故意百般刁难，大泼冷水，并且断言，鸡毛不能飞上天，民校一定办不好。但是这些流言蜚语并没有使林佩芬办民校的决心有所动摇，相反的，使她更加坚定了。林佩芬说得好：“不争嘴来要争气，定要鸡毛飞上天。”这口气争得好，这并不是争个人的意气，而是争无产阶级的志气！正因为有了这种志气，林佩芬才能在崎岖不平的道路上顽强挺进，将顽皮学生虎荣教好，将民校办好，使鸡毛飞上了天。
    林佩芬深厚的阶级感情感动着每个观众。当顽皮的虎荣吐了她一脸唾沫，又受到顾惠珍的冷嘲热讽时，她毫不埋怨，只感到自己没有完成党交给的任务而难过。“一口唾沫小事情，佩芬不生孩子气……倒是顾师母一番话，分明将工人子弟看不起……办好民校，千方百计帮助虎荣改正缺点，使他成为工人阶级的优秀子弟，定要鸡毛飞上天！”一段快板唱出了她的满腔热情，显示了她鲜明的立场、观点和深厚的阶级感情。正是基于这种观点，这种感情，才产生了强烈的事业心和责任感。小虎荣在她的耐心教育、帮助和启发下，终于认识了错误，改正了缺点。鸡毛乘东风直上九重天，大长了无产阶级的志气。顾惠珍的世界观受到了应有的批判。
