Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: According to preliminary statistics, nearly one hundred of the two hundred and fifty-eight national sports records announced by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission on January 10th this year have been broken in the past six months. Among them, our women's parachute jumpers Hua Zhaolin, Zhao Huihua, and Mei Yan, and men's aviation model athlete Sun Jingqiao, also broke two world records in May. They respectively created new world records of 2.82 meters average distance from the target in the women's 600-meter daytime collective precision parachute jump and 91.5 kilometers straight-line distance for piston-powered helicopter model aircraft flight.

Our young mountaineering team also had three mountaineers reach the summit of the world's highest peak – Mount Everest, with an elevation of 8,882 meters above sea level – from the north route in May.

The international archery sport, which was only officially launched in our country last year, has seen all twenty national records for men and women broken. In track cycling, a sport that has not been developed in our country for long, five of the nine national records for men and women have been broken, and more than fifty athletes have broken national records.

The achievements of other sports are also constantly leaping forward. For example, nineteen-year-old male high jumper Shi Hongfan broke his own national record of 2.02 meters twice in May and June, with results of 2.03 meters and 2.08 meters respectively, entering the ranks of the world's excellent male high jumpers. He Yongxian, a twenty-year-old shot putter who has broken the men's national record several times in less than half a year, recently threw the 7.257 kg shot put for the first time over 16 meters, reaching a score of 16.02 meters. Chang Guanqun, a forty-eight-year-old weightlifter, also surpassed 400 kg for the first time in his total weightlifting score, reaching 402.5 kg, breaking his own national record of 397.5 kg for the heavyweight weightlifting total score, which he had held for two years. Zhou Yongqi, an eighteen-year-old female backstroker, has broken two national records for female backstroke seven times this year. Zeng Jiwen, a rising male butterfly swimmer, has also broken two national records for male butterfly swimming multiple times. Among them, his national best result of 1 minute 2.8 seconds in the men's 100-meter butterfly has reached the world level.

Some national records that have been maintained for a long time have also been broken this year. Ma Changlu, a male javelin thrower, broke his national record of 71.12 meters created in 1956 in June. With a result of 74.58 meters, he won the javelin throw title at the Rosicky Memorial Athletics International Track and Field Competition held in Prague. Wang Shiyu, a new female discus thrower, also broke the national record of 50.93 meters created by Shi Baozhu in 1956 with a score of 51.1 meters in Moscow recently. The national record of 2 minutes 32.8 seconds for the men's 200-meter backstroke, held by Lin Jinzhu for four years, and the national record of 128 codes for female manual Morse code transmission, held by Sun Shuzhi for four years, have also been broken.

Since the beginning of this year, national records in other sports such as men's and women's speed skating, shooting, gliding, and horse racing have also been broken.

    新华社3日讯　国家体委在今年1月10日公布的二百五十八项体育运动全国纪录，据初步统计，半年来已经有近百项先后被打破。其中，我国女子跳伞运动员华沼林、赵慧华、梅严和男子航空模型选手孙景桥，在5月间还打破了两项世界纪录。他们分别创造了女子六百米日间集体定点跳伞平均距靶心二点八二米和活塞式直升模型飞机飞行直线距离九十一点五公里的世界新纪录。
    我国年轻的登山队，在5月间也有三名登山健儿从北路登上了世界最高峰——拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰顶峰。
    从去年才在我国正式开展的国际射箭运动，男女二十项全国纪录全部被刷新。在我国开展不久的赛车场自行车运动，男女九个项目的全国纪录，也已有五项被刷新，而且打破全国纪录的选手已超过五十人。
    其他一些体育运动项目的成绩，也在不断跃进。例如十九岁的男子跳高选手史鸿范，今年5、6月间就曾经先后以两米零三和两米零八的成绩，两次打破了由他本人所保持的两米零二的全国纪录，进入了世界优秀男子跳高运动员的行列。不到半年时间，已经多次打破男子铅球全国纪录的二十岁的贺永宪，最近把七点二五七公斤重的铅球第一次掷出了十六米，达到了十六米零二的成绩。四十八岁的举重运动员常冠群，不久前举重总成绩也第一次超过四百公斤，达到四零二点五公斤，打破了他自己保持了两年之久的重量级举重总成绩三九七点五公斤的全国纪录。十八岁的女子仰泳运动员周咏琪，今年已经相继七次打破了两项女子仰泳的全国纪录。后起的男子蝶泳选手曾纪文，也多次打破了两项男子蝶泳全国纪录。其中他所创造的男子百米蝶泳一分二秒八的全国最高成绩，已经达到了世界水平。
