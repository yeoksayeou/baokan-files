Heilongjiang Carefully Raises Draft Animals to Increase Animal Power for Summer Hoeing
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, July 17th) Heilongjiang Province is paying great attention to the feeding and use of large livestock during the summer hoeing. Therefore, most of the livestock are fat and strong, and they do a lot of work.

    During this year's summer hoeing production, Heilongjiang Province promoted more than 300,000 pieces of semi-mechanized farm tools and improved farm tools, most of which are powered by animal power. Therefore, all regions have particularly strengthened the feeding management and rational use of large livestock. At present, more than one million large livestock, accounting for more than 90% of the large livestock, have been concentrated throughout the province and put into summer hoeing production. Now the first and second hoeing and harrowing have basically ended throughout the province, and the third hoeing is being carried out in a concentrated manner.

    When arranging farm work for large livestock, all parts of Heilongjiang Province have generally implemented classification according to the strength of the livestock, stipulating the amount of work and the time of use, and assigning dedicated personnel to use them. In hot weather, measures are taken to go to the fields early, finish work late, and take more rest in the middle of the day, so that the livestock can do more work when the weather is cool in the morning and evening, and rest when the weather is hot at noon. In this way, the livestock not only do more work, but also do not feel tired. In terms of feeding management, all regions have achieved separate feeding and regular feeding and drinking. Each production team of Yuquan People's Commune in Acheng County feeds strong, weak, old, young, and pregnant livestock in separate troughs, and gives special care to old, weak, and pregnant livestock in feeding. Some add grass and feed, extending the feeding time, and some implement regular and quantitative feeding and drinking, bringing grass and feed when going to the fields, and feeding them during the mid-day rest. In order to ensure that the livestock are well-fed, many places have adopted the method of "refining coarse grains" for forage. In Dongning County, the grass used to feed livestock is soaked and filtered with boiling water, which has the effect of sterilization, dust removal, and softening, and the large livestock love to eat it very much.

    In order to ensure that all the large livestock are strong and fully attend work, and to achieve a combination of work and rest, the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province generally concentrate old, weak, and sick livestock together for recuperation and rejuvenation, increase nutritious feed, and treat sick livestock. Pregnant livestock are not used for about a month during the gestation period to ensure safe childbirth, and the foals are all born alive and healthy, and the dams quickly recover and are quickly bred again. Keshan County concentrated more than 100 old, weak, and sick livestock for rejuvenation and medical treatment, and increased their fat content by more than 20% in about a month. In the Dama herd of Gubei Commune in this county, there were originally more than 20 weak horses. After concentrated recuperation and grazing, they can now all be used. Since spring, Baoshan Commune in Suihua County has concentrated more than 120 old, weak, and sick horses for feeding, and more than 60 of them have been rejuvenated and used. Baipaozi Commune in Mishan County originally had 40 old and weak livestock, which were considered to have lost their ability to be used. After concentrated rejuvenation, they generally reached 70% fat content, which increased the strength of summer hoeing.

### 黑龙江精心饲养耕畜增加夏锄畜力

　　黑龙江精心饲养耕畜增加夏锄畜力
    本报哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省在夏锄中十分注意大家畜的饲养和使役。因此，大部分牲畜膘肥体壮，干活很多。
    今年夏锄生产中，黑龙江省推广了三十多万件半机械化农具和改良农具，这些新式农具大都是以畜力作动力。因此，各地特别加强了大牲畜的饲养管理与合理使役。目前全省集中了一百多万匹大牲畜，占大牲畜的90％以上，投入夏锄生产，现在全省头遍和二遍铲趟已基本结束，正在突击第三遍。
    黑龙江省各地在安排大牲畜的农活时，普遍实行了按牲畜强弱分类，规定活计和使役时间，并且固定专人使役，在热天采取早下地，晚收工，中间多休息的办法，使牲畜在早晚天气凉爽的时候多干活，到中午天气热的时候就休息。这样干的活既多、牲畜又不感到疲劳。在饲养管理方面，各地都做到了分槽饲养，定时喂饮。阿城县玉泉人民公社各生产队把强、弱、老、幼和孕畜分槽饲养，对老弱牲畜和孕畜都在饲养上给以特别照顾。有的加草加料，延长喂的时间，有的实行定时定量喂饮，下地干活的时候带草带料，在中间休息时就喂。为使牲畜吃得饱吃得好，许多地方对草料采取了“粗粮细做”的方法。东宁县对喂牲畜的草都用开水浸泡过滤，起到消毒、去土、软化的作用，大牲畜非常爱吃。
    为了保证大牲畜全壮全出工，做到劳逸结合，黑龙江省农村普遍把老、弱、病畜集中到一起进行疗养复壮，增加有营养的饲料，对病畜进行治疗。孕畜在产期一个月左右不使役，保证安全生育，幼驹全生全活，母畜很快恢复健康，而且很快又进行配种。克山县把一百多匹老、弱、病畜集中复壮医疗，在一个月左右时间内就增膘二成以上。这个县的古北公社在大马群中，原来有二十多匹弱马，经过集中疗养放牧，现在都能使役。绥化县宝山公社春季以来，有一百二十多匹老、弱、病马集中饲养，目前已有六十多匹复壮使役。密山县白泡子公社原先有四十匹老弱牲畜，被认为失掉了使役能力，经过集中复壮，普遍提到七成膘，增加了夏锄的力量。
