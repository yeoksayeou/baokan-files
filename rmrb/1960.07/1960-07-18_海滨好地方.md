　　Good Places by the Sea
　　Shigong

　　In nature, the scenery of the seaside is the most magnificent, open, ever-changing, and fascinating. At the seaside, powerful natural forces compete with each other, and life thrives in the struggle with nature, making the seaside a rich and colorful world.

　　Look at the surging waves, like fierce beasts, constantly rushing towards the shore. This force is very great, with the impact force on each square meter reaching several tons or even more than ten tons. Especially when the sea water is mixed with sand and gravel, it is like a grinding wheel, and the destructive power is even greater. Just like "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," after a long period of time, the part of the coast that is frequently impacted by the sea water is eroded into grooves. When the grooves are eroded very deeply, the remaining parts above cannot support themselves, so they collapse and become rubble. The rubble is then gradually broken down into gravel, which is moved to the seabed and piled up when the sea water retreats back into the sea. At this time, the coastline retreats towards the mainland. The Medoc Peninsula on the Atlantic coast of France retreated one hundred and five meters between 1842 and 1845.

　　Just as the coast is being destroyed, another huge natural force is seizing land from the sea, pushing the coast forward. This natural force is the river.

　　Rivers, like "Jingwei filling the sea," tirelessly carry sediment into the sea. The most famous is the Yellow River, which used to carry more than 900 million tons of sediment into the sea every year, turning the sea of ​​the past into today's plain. Currently, the coast near the mouth of the Yellow River is still advancing towards the sea at a rate of more than 300 meters per year.

　　While rivers and oceans are fighting, the up and down movements of the earth's crust also participate and have an impact. The rise of the earth's crust helps the expansion of the land, and the subsidence of the earth's crust is conducive to the advancement of the ocean. However, things are not absolute. In our country, the Songliao Plain, the Hebei Plain, and the Jianghuai Plain are all sinking areas, but because the rivers bring particularly large amounts of sediment, the sea has not been able to gain an advantage. On the contrary, it has created a lot of land. The coasts of these areas are relatively straight due to siltation, and the water near the sea is shallower, lacking winding harbors, which is convenient for seawater to flood the mainland during high tide, which can be retained for salt production, making it the most important salt production area in our country.

　　If there is not enough sediment to stop the sea water from attacking, the coast is often destroyed into complex shapes: the land and sea are interlaced, and the harbors are intricate and winding. This is also related to the hardness of the coastal rocks. Soft rocks are easily destroyed, so they often sink in there. However, in nature, the factors that affect coastal changes are much more complex than what we have mentioned here. The current appearance of the coast is the result of various influences.

　　In places with many harbors and steep coasts, although it is not convenient for salt production, it is convenient for the development of shipping and fishing, and many famous summer resorts are always in these areas. The Shandong Peninsula and the Liaodong Peninsula are the oldest land in our country. They have been destroyed for a long time, and the mountains remaining on the coast are not very high, making it easy for people to move around. At the same time, as a result of long-term weathering, the ground is covered with soil suitable for plant growth, and after people's labor and construction, it has both the beauty of mountains and rivers and the beauty of gardens, and there are good summer resorts such as Qingdao and Dalian.

　　The role of the seaside is far more than just for recreation. In the shallow sea close to the land, due to the abundance of sunlight and air, the organisms are the most prosperous, and it is an important source of food for mankind in the future. It is estimated that the total amount of organisms in the ocean is about five to ten times that on land, and today the food we obtain from the ocean only accounts for about 1% of the food we consume. Therefore, the potential of the ocean, especially the shallow sea, as a food source is very great.

　　In ancient shallow seas, many minerals such as petroleum, manganese, and aluminum have been formed. Are these types of minerals still being formed and have already been formed in today's shallow seas? This is possible. Oil and gas shows have been discovered in many places along the coast of our country. According to the January 18 newspaper report, the Soviet Union has discovered manganese mines on the seabed of the Pacific Ocean. The underground wealth of the seaside seems to be very worthy of attention. In fact, the sea water in the sea is also a valuable resource. In addition to being able to produce salt, every cubic kilometer of sea water also contains nearly a thousand tons of potassium salt, magnesium salt and other useful things, as well as the raw material for thermonuclear reaction—heavy water. The huge power that the roaring sea water vents to the coast is now going to be tamed and serve mankind. Our country has built some tidal power stations along the coast. It is estimated that the tidal energy in the world is about 40 billion kilowatts, which is more than ten times greater than the hydropower resources on the mainland. In addition, the experiment of using sea waves to generate electricity has also been successful. The seaside is increasingly becoming our treasure house. Our country's coastline is very long, stretching more than 14,000 kilometers from north to south. If the length of the coastline of coastal islands is added, it is about 23,000 kilometers. The territorial waters connected to it are our sacred and inviolable territory!

　　海滨好地方
　　石工
    在大自然中，海滨的景色最是雄伟开朗，而且变化万千，引人入胜。在海滨，强大的自然力在那里彼此角逐，而生命则在和自然搏斗中旺盛地繁殖起来，使海滨成为一个丰富多彩的世界。
    你看那汹涌的海浪像猛兽一样，不住地向海岸扑去。这个力量是很大的，每平方米面积上受到的冲击力可以达到几吨乃至十几吨。特别当海水中夹有沙石的时候，就更如沙轮磨擦，破坏力越发大了。正像“愚公移山”一样，经过长久的岁月，在海岸经常受到冲击的部分被海水淘成凹槽。当凹槽淘得很深时，上面残留部分便支持不住了，于是崩塌下来成为碎石。碎石再逐渐破坏成沙砾，在海水退回海中时被搬到海底堆积起来，这时海岸线向大陆方面后退了，法国大西洋岸上的梅多半岛在1842年至1845年间海岸后撤了一百零五米。
    正当海岸在受到破坏的时候，另一支巨大的自然力却在向大海夺取土地，把海岸向前推进，这个自然力就是河流。
    河流像“精卫填海”一样不倦地把泥沙送到海中。最著名的如黄河，从前每年带进海里的泥沙约有九亿多吨，它使昔日的海变成了今天的平原。目前黄河河口附近的海岸还在以每年三百多米的速度向大海前进。
    在河流与海洋斗争的同时，地壳的升降运动也参加进来发生影响。地壳的上升帮助着陆地的扩大，地壳的下降则有利于海洋的推进。然而事情也不是绝对的，在我国，松辽平原、河北平原和江淮平原都是下沉地带，但由于河流带来的泥沙特别多，大海并未能占到优势，相反，倒造成了许多陆地。这些地带的海滨由于泥沙淤积，所以海岸比较平直，海边的水也较浅，缺少曲折的港湾，而这正便于海水在涨潮时漫上大陆，拦蓄起来晒盐，成为我国最重要的产盐区。
    如果没有足够的泥沙来阻挡海水的进攻，这时海岸就常被破坏成复杂的形状：海陆犬牙相错，港湾错综曲折。这与海岸岩石的软硬也有关系，软的岩石易受破坏，于是那里常常凹了进去，但在自然中，影响海岸变化的因素比我们这里所说的要复杂得多，今天海岸的面貌是受各方面影响的结果。
    在港湾众多、海岸陡峭的地方，虽不便于晒盐，却便于发展航运和渔业，而许多著名的避暑胜地也总是在这些地带。山东半岛、辽东半岛都是我国最古老的陆地，受到破坏的时间很长，海滨残余的山已不太高了，便于人们活动。同时由于长期风化的结果，使地面盖上了适于植物生长的土壤，再经过人的劳动建设，因而既有山水之胜，又有园林之美，出现了青岛和大连等避暑的好地方。
    海滨的作用远不止供人游憩而已，在靠近陆地的浅海中，由于阳光空气都较充足，生物最为繁盛，是人类未来的重要食料来源。据估计，海洋中生物的总量约为陆地上的五至十倍，而今天我们从海洋取得的食料，仅约占我们所消耗的食料的1％ 。因此，海洋特别是浅海作为食料来源的潜力是很大的。
    在古代的浅海中曾经形成了石油、锰、铝等许多矿产。今天的浅海中是不是也正在形成并且已经形成了不少这类矿产呢？这是有可能的。我国的沿海一带已有好些地方发现了油气苗。据1月18日报纸消息，苏联已在太平洋的海底发现了锰矿。海滨的地下财富看来是很值得注意的。其实海中的海水也是珍贵的资源，除了可以晒盐外，每立方公里海水中，还含有近千吨的钾盐、镁盐等其他有用的东西，以及热核反应的原料——重水。那咆哮的海水向海岸发泄的巨大力量现在也要被驯服而为人类服务了。我国沿海已建设了一些潮汐发电站。据估计全世界潮汐的能约有四百亿瓩，比大陆上的水力资源大十多倍。此外利用海浪来发电的试验也成功了，海滨正日益成为我们的宝库。我国的海岸线是很长的，从北到南绵延一万四千多公里，如果加上沿海岛屿的海岸线的长度共约二万三千多公里，与此相连的领海，是我们的神圣不可侵犯的疆土！
