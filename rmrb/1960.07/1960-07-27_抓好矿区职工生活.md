    Do a Good Job in Miners' Livelihood
    "The mine is better than home," This is the heartfelt praise of the workers of the Liziya Iron Mine in Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, for their mine. This praise is not accidental. The leading cadres of the Liziya Mine have indeed done an excellent job in comprehensively caring for the lives of the workers and continuously improving their living conditions.
    Grasping production with one hand and livelihood with the other is the Party's consistent policy. Production and livelihood are two important aspects of social and economic activities, and the relationship between the two is mutually restrictive and mutually promoting. This is especially true for an enterprise. We know that the production tasks of the mining industry in the second half of the year are very heavy. In order to strive to achieve the mining production plan, the leading departments of each mining area must do a lot of work, such as strengthening the organization, leadership and management of production, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously carrying out technical improvements in mines, and so on. Undoubtedly, these tasks are important and must be put first. However, on the other hand, it must also be seen that the completion and over fulfillment of the enterprise's production plan depends on the broad masses of workers, on their ever-increasing enthusiasm for labor and creativity. And caring for the lives of the broad masses of workers in every possible way is one of the conditions for ensuring the continuous growth of this enthusiasm for labor and creativity. The leading cadres of the Liziya Iron Mine improved their leadership style and worked hard to improve the lives of the workers, which greatly encouraged the morale of the workers, and also quickly brought about a new situation of "reduced personnel, improved work efficiency; doubled output, and continuous leap forward" in production. This shows that grasping production and grasping life are consistent. To set grasping production against grasping life will not only be detrimental to improving the lives of the masses, but also detrimental to the continuous leap forward in production.
    Mining areas are different from cities, and most of them are located in the inconvenient wilderness, deep mountains or remote areas. It is naturally more difficult to arrange the lives of workers well in such an environment and under such conditions. However, difficulties can be overcome. The key lies in whether the leaders take it seriously and what working methods are used to grasp it. Like grasping production, grasping life is certainly not good if it is not grasped tightly and fiercely, but if the method of grasping is not correct, it will not achieve great results. The Liziya Iron Mine provides a good experience in this regard. They adopted the working method of relying on their own efforts and following the mass line, relying on and mobilizing the masses to solve their own living problems. For example, they mobilized the masses of workers to come up with ideas and methods to vigorously carry out the mass movement of non-staple food production; in cultural life, they organized workers to teach themselves and learn from each other, and achieved good results. With the support of the masses, all difficulties can be easily overcome, and as a result, the living conditions of the workers in this mine have been improved. The experiences of the Liziya Iron Mine are worth learning from in various mining areas.

    抓好矿区职工生活
    “矿山比家好”，这是四川岳池县李子垭铁矿职工对这个矿山发自内心的赞颂。这个赞颂不是偶然的。李子垭矿山领导干部在全面关心职工生活、不断改善职工生活条件方面，确是做得很出色的。
    一手抓生产，一手抓生活，这是党的一贯方针。生产和生活，这是社会经济活动的两个重要方面，两者的关系是互相约制而又互相促进的。就一个企业来说，更是如此。我们知道，采掘工业下半年的生产任务是十分繁重的，为了努力实现采掘生产计划，各矿区领导部门要做许多工作，例如加强对生产的组织领导和管理，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大力进行矿山的技术改进，等等，毫无疑问，这些工作都是重要的，必须放到第一位上来。但是，另一方面也必须看到，完成和超额完成企业的生产计划，要依靠广大职工群众，依靠他们不断增长的劳动热情和创造性。而无微不至地关心职工群众的生活，正是保证这种劳动热情和创造性不断增长的条件之一。李子垭铁矿领导干部改进领导作风，狠抓职工生活，职工的情绪受到了很大的鼓舞，生产上也迅速出现了“人员减少，工效提高；产量加番，持续跃进”的新面貌。这就说明抓生产和抓生活是一致的。把抓生产和抓生活对立起来，其结果不仅不利于改善群众生活，而且也不利于生产的持续跃进。
    矿区不同于城市，大多是在交通不便的野外、深山或边远地区。在这样的环境和条件下要安排好职工生活，困难自然也要多些。但是困难是可以克服的，关键在于领导是否认真去抓、采用什么工作方法去抓。抓生活和抓生产一样，抓而不紧、不狠，固然不能抓好，但是如果抓的方法不对头，那也是不会收到大的效果的。李子垭铁矿在这方面提供了一条很好的经验。他们采取了自力更生走群众路线的工作方法，依靠和发动群众解决群众自己的生活问题。例如他们发动职工群众出主意想办法，大搞副食品生产的群众运动；在文化生活上组织职工自教自学，都取得了良好效果。有了群众的支持，一切困难就都容易克服了，结果这个矿山的职工生活条件改善了。李子垭铁矿的这些经验是值得各地矿区学习的。
