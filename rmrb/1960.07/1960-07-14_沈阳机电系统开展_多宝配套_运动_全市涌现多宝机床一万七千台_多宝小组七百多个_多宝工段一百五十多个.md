Shenyang Electromechanical System Launches "Multi-Treasure Combination" Campaign

　　17,000 "Multi-Treasure Machine Tools" Emerge Throughout the City, Along With Over 700 "Multi-Treasure Groups" and Over 150 "Multi-Treasure Work Sections"

    (Our newspaper Shenyang, July 13th dispatch) The workers of Shenyang City's machinery and electrical appliance industry have launched a massive mass "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign to rapidly integrate and promote new technologies and experiences from technological innovation. Currently, the machinery and electrical systems have seen the emergence of over 17,600 "Multi-Treasure Machine Tools" equipped with several to a dozen advanced experiences, over 700 "Multi-Treasure Groups" equipped with multiple advanced experiences for each piece of equipment, and over 150 "Multi-Treasure Work Sections," which has greatly promoted the sustained leap forward in production.

      The "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign in Shenyang City's machinery and electrical appliance industry has been well received by the majority of workers because it can give full play to the comprehensive effects of various advanced experiences and ensure the comprehensive improvement of production in all work procedures. Since the end of May, this campaign has rapidly expanded from a few factories to all machinery and electrical appliance factories in the city, becoming an effective method for consolidating, promoting, and improving innovation results, and ensuring a large-scale harvest.

      In the past, many advanced experiences in Shenyang City's machinery and electrical appliance factories could not be promoted because the masses were not fully mobilized; in some cases, one work procedure was promoted, but other work procedures were not, resulting in the promoted work procedure not being consolidated. In this "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign, factories, through the form of mass movements, selected, finalized, and promoted advanced experiences from both inside and outside the factory according to work type and work procedure, greatly consolidating the results of innovation. Workers at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, in the "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign, promoted nearly a thousand kinds of advanced experiences in various work types in just ten days. As a result of the widespread application of advanced experiences in various work types and work procedures, production efficiency increased by 25% to 50%.

      The "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign is also a movement for workers to consciously learn from the advanced. In the past, some factory leaders only paid attention to encouraging workers to create and neglected the promotion of advanced experiences, resulting in the idea of "creation is glorious, learning is incompetent" among many workers, making it difficult to promote many advanced experiences. In this campaign, due to the full ideological mobilization, a mass movement to promote advanced experiences was created, and the enthusiasm of the majority of workers to learn advanced experiences was greatly increased. In many factories, a situation of catching up with each other and competing to learn advanced experiences emerged. Liu Guangzhi, a worker at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, integrated and promoted more than fifty kinds of advanced experiences in the campaign, increasing production efficiency by nearly two times, and was called the "Multi-Treasure King" by the workers, who learned from him one after another. Four female workers on the "March 8th" machine tool at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory broke the superstitious idea that "low-level workers cannot innovate and integrate" in the campaign. After learning from advanced workers and diligently studying, they successively integrated thirteen kinds of experiences such as multi-tool and multi-edge, increasing production efficiency by one to twenty times.

    The "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign carried out by the Shenyang City Machinery and Electrical Appliance Factories is the product of leading cadres going deep into reality and deep into the masses. The experience of "Multi-Treasure Combination" is a variety of effective methods for leading cadres in many factories to concentrate on mass learning and promoting advanced experience, gradually formed through continuous enrichment and supplementation. Moreover, methods such as large performances, large visits, and large evaluations are also adopted to help the workers and masses overcome the difficulties in the process of applying advanced experience, and effectively consolidate the results of the "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign.

    The mass "Multi-Treasure Combination" campaign is vigorously changing the production face of the Shenyang City machinery and electrical appliance industry, attracting the attention of all parties. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting to promote this experience to all industrial departments and other departments.

　　沈阳机电系统开展“多宝配套”运动
　　全市涌现多宝机床一万七千台  多宝小组七百多个  多宝工段一百五十多个
    本报沈阳13日电　沈阳市机械电器工业职工开展声势浩大的群众性“多宝配套”运动，把技术革新中的新技术新经验
  迅速配套推广。目前机械电器
  系统已涌现出配有数种到十几种先进经验的“多宝机床”一万七千六百多台，台台设备配上了多种先进经验的“多宝小组”七百多个，“多宝工段”一百五十多个，对促进生产持续跃进起了很大作用。
      沈阳市机械电器工业开展
  “多宝配套”运动，由于能够充分发挥各种先进经验的综合效果，保证各工序生产全面提高，因而受到了广大职工的欢迎。这一运动从5月下旬起，迅速由少数工厂扩展到全市各个机械电器工厂，成了巩固、推广、提高革新成果，保证大面积丰收的有效方法。
      过去沈阳市各机械电器工厂由于没有充分发动群众，许多先进经验一直推广不开；有的一个工序推广了，其他工序没有推广，结果推广了的工序也巩固不住。在这次“多宝配套”运动中，各厂通过群众运动的形式，把厂内外的先进经验，按工种工序精选定型配套推广，大大巩固了革新成果。沈阳第一机床厂职工，在“多宝配套”运动中，仅十天时间，就在各个工种推广了近千种先进经验。由于各个工种和各工序普遍成套运用了先进经验，结果生产效率提高了25％到50％。
      “多宝配套”运动，也是职工自觉地学习先进的运动。过去有些工厂领导方面只注意鼓励工人创造，忽视先进经验的推广，在不少工人中产生了
  “创造光荣、学习无能”的思想，因而许多先进经验不易推广。在这次运动中，由于充分地进行了思想发动，造成了推广先进经验的群众运动，广大职工学习先进经验的积极性大为提高。在不少工厂出现了你追我赶、竞学先进经验的局面。沈阳第三机床厂工人刘广志，在运动中把五十多种先进经验配套推广，生产效率提高了将近两倍，被工人们称为“多宝大王”，并纷纷向他学习。沈阳矿山机器厂“三八”机床上的四名女工，在运动中打破了“低级工不能革新配套”的迷信思想，经过向先进工人学习和刻苦钻研，先后配成了多刀多刃等十三种经验，提高生产效率一倍到二十倍。
    沈阳市各机械电器工厂开展“多宝配套”运动，是领导干部深入实际，深入群众的产物。“多宝配套”的经验是不少工厂领导干部集中群众学习和推广先进经验的多种有效方法，经过不断充实补充，逐渐形成的。而且，还采取大表演，大参观，大评比等办法，帮助职工群众克服运用先进经验过程中的困难，有效地巩固了“多宝配套”运动的成果。
    群众性的“多宝配套”运动，正在有力地改变着沈阳市机械电器工业的生产面貌，引起了各方面的注意。中共沈阳市委最近召开现场会议，向所有工业部门和其他部门推广了这一经验。
