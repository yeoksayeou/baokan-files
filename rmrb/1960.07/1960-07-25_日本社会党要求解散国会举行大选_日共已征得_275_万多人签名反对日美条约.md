Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Saburo Eda stated in Takasaki City today that the Socialist Party firmly demands the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of a general election.

	He said that the Socialist Party intends to announce its election platform before the Diet is dissolved.

	Eda was in Takasaki City to support the Socialist candidate in the Gunma Prefecture gubernatorial election.

	Eda also made a statement while passing through Okaya City, Nagano Prefecture, on the 23rd. He said that in order to safeguard the Constitution, the Socialist Party will resolutely launch a struggle to reject the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Socialist Party plans to request the Japanese government to hold a special Diet session within this week to discuss the issue of dissolving the Diet. If this request is not accepted, a signature campaign demanding the dissolution of the Diet will be launched. He said that the Socialist Party has decided to strive for the dissolution of the Diet around August 18th and to strive for a general election around September 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party announced on the 22nd that the number of people in Japan who have signed the JCP's signature books to protest the U.S. and Japanese governments' forced conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has reached 2,757,233.

	This signature campaign, launched by the JCP nationwide since February, ended on July 20th.

	Twenty-four prefectures, including Hokkaido and Ibaraki Prefecture, exceeded the original planned signature target. Among them, Ibaraki Prefecture completed 264% of the target, Kanagawa Prefecture completed 227.9%, and Saga Prefecture completed 227.7%. During the campaign, the staff of the JCP Central Committee also actively participated in the signature collection activities, and they completed 204.3% of the original target.

	"Akahata" (Red Flag) published an article on the 23rd pointing out that this signature campaign has played a significant role in exposing the two enemies of the Japanese people—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique, the agent of Japanese monopoly capital. At the same time, it is a very effective method for the Japanese people to express their will to oppose and protest the revision of the "Security Treaty," and it is of great significance in strengthening the unity between the Party and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: Five hundred Japanese film workers, including directors, playwrights, actors, and cinematographers, held a meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 22nd and unanimously adopted a declaration announcing the invalidity of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	On the same day, sixteen Japanese film workers' groups jointly issued a statement announcing that they do not recognize the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	At the film workers' meeting last night, Tokyo University professor Masao Maruyama delivered a speech, strongly condemning the U.S.-Japan reactionaries for forcibly "passing" the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet and exposing their conspiracy to undermine peace.

	Maruyama pointed out the impact of the strong opposition of the Japanese people on the treaty. He emphasized that in the future, the Japanese people must organize to monitor the actions of the ruling class and resist their anti-people politics.

	Participants spoke one after another, expressing that they would not be discouraged by the fact that the new "Security Treaty" had been forcibly "passed" and resolved to fight against the reactionary forces that obstruct the progress of the Japanese people with full of anger.

	The meeting read letters sent to the meeting from director Keisuke Kinoshita, Tomu Uchida, and many famous actors, as well as journalists, musicians, and others. In the letters, they unanimously stated that they would join the participants in launching a thorough struggle against the enemy.

	Yoshino Genzaburo, representative of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," Takizawa Osamu, representative of the "Theater Workers Opposing the Security Treaty Conference," and Minami Hiroshi, representative of the National Culture Conference, delivered speeches one after another, unanimously pointing out the necessity of cultural figures uniting to launch a struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Tokyo Dispatch: "Akahata" reported today that an amateur photographer in Omuta City photographed a U.S. RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft parked at the Itazuke Air Force Base in Kyushu.

	The Japanese government had claimed that this type of aircraft was not stationed in Japan. However, the photographer took a photo of this aircraft on April 26th of this year.

	Sixteen representatives of the Itazuke Association for the Abolition of the Base, who recently obtained the photos taken by the photographer, met with U.S. Commander Colonel Dennis River at the Itazuke Base on the 20th and demanded that the RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft be withdrawn from Japan.

	Colonel River was forced to admit that this type of aircraft had parked at the Itazuke Base several times in the past.

	After meeting with the U.S. base commander, the Fukuoka Prefecture People's Joint Struggle Conference for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" immediately ordered its affiliated joint struggle organizations to actively carry out protest movements against the stationing of this dangerous aircraft in Japan.

    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长江田三郎今天在高崎市发表谈话说，社会党坚决要求解散国会，举行大选。
    他说，社会党打算在解散国会以前公布它的竞选纲领。
    江田是为声援社会党人竞选群马县知事而到高崎市的。
    江田23日路过长野县的岗谷市时，也发表了谈话。他说，社会党为维护宪法，将坚决展开不承认新日美“安全条约”的斗争。社会党准备在本周内要求日本政府为解散国会问题举行国会临时会议。如果这项要求没有被接受，就要开展要求解散国会的签名运动。他说，社会党已经决定争取在8月18日前后解散国会，争取在9月15日前后举行大选。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会书记局22日宣布，日本人民在日共的签名簿上签名抗议美日两国政府强行缔结新日美“安全条约”的人数已经达到二百七十五万七千二百三十三人。

    “赤旗报”23日就此发表文章指出，这次签名运动在揭露日本人民的两个敌人——美帝国主义和日本垄断资本代理人岸信介集团这一点上起了巨大作用。同时，它是日本人民表达反对和抗议修改“安全条约”意志的一种非常有效的方法，并且在加强党和人民的团结方面具有巨大意义。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本五百名电影工作者包括导演、剧作家、演员和摄影师22日晚间在东京举行大会，一致通过一项宣言，宣布新日美“安全条约”无效。
    同一天，日本十六个电影工作者团体联合发表声明，宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”。
    在电影工作者昨晚举行的大会上，东京大学教授丸山真男发表讲演，强烈谴责美日反动派强使国会“通过”新“安全条约”，并且揭露了他们破坏和平的阴谋。
    丸山指出了日本人民的强烈反对对于这项条约的打击。他强调说，今后日本人民必须组织起来监视统治阶级的所作所为，抵抗它们的反人民的政治。
    与会者纷纷发言，表示他们不因为新“安全条约”已经被强行“通过”而灰心，决心以满腔的愤怒同阻挠日本人民前进的反动势力展开斗争。
    大会宣读了导演木下惠介、内田吐梦和许多著名演员以及新闻工作者、音乐家等寄给大会的书信。他们在信中一致表示将同与会者一起同敌人展开彻底的斗争。
    “安全条约批判会”代表吉野源三郎、“话剧界人士反对安全条约会议”代表泷泽修和国民文化会议代表南博等相继致词，一致指出文化界人士团结起来展开斗争的必要性。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天报道，大牟田市一位业余摄影者把停放在九州的板付空军基地的美国RB—47型侦察机拍摄下来了。
    日本政府曾经宣称这种飞机没有停在日本。但是这位摄影者在今年4月26日摄下了这种飞机的照片。
    最近得到了这位摄影者所拍摄的照片的板付争取取消基地协会的十六名代表，20日去板付基地同美国司令丹尼斯·里佛尔上校会晤，要求把RB—47型侦察机撤出日本。
    里佛尔上校被迫承认，这种飞机过去曾经有几次停在板付基地。
    在同美国基地司令会晤以后，福冈县废除“安全条约”县民共同斗争会议立即命令所属共同斗争组织积极开展反对这种危险的飞机停驻在日本的抗议运动。
