    Xinhua News Agency:
    Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province has adapted and promoted the experience of the "Two-Five System" leadership method of Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, and universally implemented the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, achieving remarkable results.

    The "Three-Seven System" leadership method means that in every ten days, three days are spent in meetings to study work, deploy tasks, and learn; and seven days are spent going deep into the grassroots to participate in production and lead production. Currently, all twelve counties and one hundred and twenty-two communes in the prefecture have begun to implement this system. In implementing this system, various localities have also adopted some supplementary measures in light of local conditions to make this leadership method more complete and more suitable for local work and production needs. For example, Houzhai Commune in Yiwu County stipulates that learning is organized on the first day of the ten day period, work is checked and studied on the second, and summary evaluation and work deployment are carried out on the third. Danyang Commune in Jiande County, based on local characteristics, adopted the method of "four days squatting at a point to gain experience, three days going around to grasp the overall situation" during the seven days of going deep into the grassroots, so that the points and the whole area were well combined.

    Practice over the past month and more has proved that the implementation of the "Three-Seven System" leadership method has many benefits. Cadres at all levels go deep into the front line of production, leading production in a more solid, in-depth, and concrete way, grasping work meticulously and accurately, and the Party's guidelines and policies can quickly meet the masses. According to statistics from the county-level organs of Jiangshan, Yiwu, Jinhua, and Suichang counties, there are now 1,715 cadres who have gone deep into the front line of production, an increase of 431 people compared with before the implementation of the "Three-Seven System". Because the work is in-depth, the discovery and resolution of problems are more timely; for advanced figures and advanced experiences that appear in production, they can be discovered in a timely manner and promoted rapidly. Yuan Fanglie, Secretary of the Qu County Party Committee, went deep into Changshan Commune and found that the commune was doing a good job in producing humic acid salt, a type of indigenous fertilizer. He immediately helped summarize the experience and held an on-site meeting to promote it universally, which vigorously promoted the production of humic acid salt in the entire county. After rice transplanting, leading cadres of the Yiwu County Party Committee went deep into the Hongyan Production Team of the Suxi Commune and found that this team had a set of scientific management experience in achieving a large area of balanced growth of early rice, so they immediately helped summarize and promote it. At present, 213 production teams in the county have caught up with the management level of the Hongyan Team.

    After the implementation of the "Three-Seven System", cadres and the masses spend more time together in production and life, which has further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Commune members said: "When leaders go to the front line, commune members' enthusiasm is increased, twisting into a rope, conquering nature." The broad masses of cadres also said that the work is now "three fast": problems are discovered quickly, solved quickly, and experiences are promoted quickly; "three clear": the work foundation is clear, the mind is clear when guiding production, and because of joint planning with the commune members, the commune members' hearts are also clear. As a result, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members has been further mobilized, which has vigorously promoted production. The implementation of the "Three-Seven System" leadership method also enables cadres to combine theory with practice, learning with work, and effectively improve the cadres' political and theoretical level, overcoming the phenomenon that learning is often squeezed out due to busy production and work.

    金华专区因地制宜推广吴桥经验
    普遍实行“三七制”领导方法进一步密切干群关系有力地推动了生产
    本报讯　浙江省金华专区因地制宜推广河北省吴桥县“二五制”领导方法的经验，普遍实行“三七制”的领导方法，取得了显著的效果。
      “三七制”的领导方法，即每十天当中有三天时间开会研究工作、布置任务、学习；七天时间深入基层参加生产领导生产。目前全专区十二个县、一百二十二个公社都开始实行这一制度。各地在实行这一制度时，还因地制宜地采取了一些补充办法，使这一领导方法更加完善，更加适合本地工作和生产的需要。如义乌县后宅公社规定逢一组织学习，逢二检查、研究工作，逢三进行总结评比和部署工作。建德县大洋公社根据当地特点，在七天深入基层的时间内，采取了
  “四天蹲点摸经验，三天打圈抓全面”的办法，使点面很好地结合起来。
    一个多月来的实践证明，实行“三七制”领导方法有很多好处。各级干部深入生产第一线，领导生产更加扎实、深入具体，工作抓得细、抓得准，党的方针政策能够迅速和群众见面。据江山、义乌、金华、遂昌四个县县级机关的统计，现在有一千七百一十五名干部深入生产第一线，比实行“三七制”以前增加四百三十一人。由于工作深入，发现和解决问题就更加及时；对于生产中出现的先进人物和先进经验，就能够及时发现和迅速推广。中共衢县委员会书记袁芳烈，深入到常山公社后，发现这个公社土化肥——胡敏酸盐搞得很好，他便立即帮助总结了经验，召开现场会议普遍推广，有力地促进了全县胡敏酸盐的生产。中共义乌县委领导干部在早稻插秧后，深入到苏溪公社红焰生产队，发现这个队在实现早稻生长大面积平衡方面有一套科学的管理经验，就立即帮助总结推广，目前全县已有二百一十三个生产队赶上了红焰队的管理水平。
    实行“三七制”后，由于干部和群众在一起生产和生活的时间多了，进一步密切了干部同群众的关系。社员们说：“领导上前线，社员干劲添，拧成一股绳，征服大自然。”广大干部也说，现在做工作是“三快”：问题发现得快，解决得快，经验推广得快；“三清”：工作底子清，指导生产时头脑清，由于和社员同谋共策，社员心底也清了。因而进一步调动了广大社员的积极性，有力地推动了生产。实行“三七制”领导方法还使干部能够把理论和实际、学习和工作结合起来，有效地提高了干部的政治理论水平，克服了往往因生产、工作忙而挤掉学习的现象。（附图片）
