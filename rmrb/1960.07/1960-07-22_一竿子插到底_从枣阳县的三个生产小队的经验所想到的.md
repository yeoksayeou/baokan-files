Driving the Stake All the Way Down
    ——Thoughts Inspired by the Experiences of Three Production Teams in Zaoyang County
    Gong Tongwen

Where is the “bottom”? Where should the “stake” be driven to be considered all the way down to the “bottom”? The experiences of three production teams in Zaoyang County answer this question.

In terms of rural work, the “bottom” lies in the production teams and production brigades of the People's Commune. This is the front line of agricultural production, and also the basic-level unit that directly organizes the lives of commune members. The Party's leadership, this "stake," must be driven directly through Party organizations at all levels—right into the production teams and production brigades—to be considered "driven" to the "bottom." Only then can the Party's guidelines, lines, and policies take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the masses of commune members.

The People's Commune is the organizer of production and life. To organize the production and life of tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of people well is a very heavy burden. During individual farming, this large burden was divided into several or even tens of thousands of small burdens; during cooperativization, this burden became heavier; after the People's Communes were established, this burden became even heavier. This "thousand-pound burden" cannot be shouldered by one or a few people. "A thousand-pound burden carried by ten thousand people" is the experience of Yang Lijun, a production brigade leader in Zaoyang County. Comrade Yang Lijun not only conscientiously shouldered the "burden" himself, but also united many people to help him carry the burden. As a result, the work of his brigade has been at the forefront. Because "a thousand-pound burden is carried by ten thousand people," the burden is lighter and we run faster. If all production brigade leaders work like Comrade Yang Lijun, why worry about a "thousand-pound burden"? Even a "ten-thousand-ton burden" is not to be feared!

How can we achieve "a thousand-pound burden carried by ten thousand people"? Yang Lijun's experience is: first, lead by example; second, help (help solve specific problems below); third, inspect (inspect the progress of work). Yang Lijun used this method to cultivate a group of activists, such as the "Five Tiger Generals." Why can't Party organizations at all levels use this method to cultivate thousands upon thousands of Yang Lijuns? This method of leading, helping, and inspecting is a working method of driving the stake all the way down. "Leading" means going to the production teams and brigades to "lead"; "helping" means going to the production teams and brigades to "help"; "inspecting" means going to the production teams and brigades to "inspect." In simple terms, it means facing the grassroots and going to the masses of the people!

Why haven't the Party's policies directly met with the masses in some places? Is this related to the ideological style of the staff in these places? For example, to comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and life is the basic and urgent requirement of the broad masses of commune members. The higher Party organizations have said it many times, so why don't some production teams and brigades follow suit, or why do they greatly discount it in the process of implementation? These are questions that we should think about.

Look at the experiences of these three production teams in Zaoyang County! To be honest, these three production teams each have their strengths and weaknesses. Combining the experiences of these three production teams is a set of experiences in organizing collective production and life. There is nothing mysterious about this set of experiences. To put it plainly, it is two sentences: one sentence is to do things according to the needs of the masses, and the other sentence is to do things according to the Party's policies. The Party's policies and the demands of the masses are consistent; listening to the Party and listening to the masses are consistent. The reason why these three brigades have achieved relatively significant results is that the cadres working here have listened to the Party and listened to the masses.

Listening to the Party and listening to the masses should not be treated as abstract adjectives, nor should it be just a subjective wish. Instead, this sentence must be implemented into practical action. That is to say, the Party's policies and the demands of the masses must be reflected in the specific work of organizing production and life. Like Comrade Yang Lijun of Zhongdian, like the three old men of Sanlimiao, like Tan Shusheng of Tanjiawan, love the commune as their home, take the commune as their home, and manage and do everything that is beneficial to the people; manage everything above and below, only recognize the truth and not people, and serve the people wholeheartedly! In this way, we can "drive the stake all the way down."

Let comrades pay attention to the experiences of these three brigades in Zaoyang County, let comrades summarize such experiences in their own work areas, and let comrades check whether the Party's line, guidelines, and policies have taken root, blossomed, and bear fruit among the people in your area? Have the many specific demands currently put forward to you by the Party and the masses been fulfilled, and how can they be further fulfilled? The key lies in improving the style of leadership, in facing the grassroots, in going to the production teams, in going to the production brigades, in going to the fields, in going to the canteens, in going to the masses of the people, and in driving the stake all the way down!

### 一竿子插到底——从枣阳县的三个生产小队的经验所想到的

    一竿子插到底
    ——从枣阳县的三个生产小队的经验所想到的
    龚同文
    “底”在哪里？“竿子”扎到什么地方才算到了“底”？枣阳县的三个生产小队的经验回答了这个问题。
    就农村工作来说，“底”在人民公社的生产队、生产小队，这是农业生产的第一线，也是直
  接组织社员生活的基层单位。党的领导这个“竿子”要通过各级党组织——直扎到生产队和生产小队，才算是“扎”到了“底”，党的方针、路线和政策，才能在社员群众中生根、开花、结果。
    人民公社是生产、生活的组织者，要把几万人以至十几万人的生产和生活都组织得很好，这是一个很重的担子。在单干的时候，这个大担子分散成几个以至几万个小担子；在合作化的时候，这个担子就重一些了；在人民公社化以后，这个担子更重了。这个“千斤担子”，一个人、几个人挑不起来。“千斤担子万人挑”这是枣阳县的一位生产小队长杨立钧同志的经验。杨立钧同志不只是自己认真负责地挑起了“担子”，而且，他还团结了许多人帮他挑担子，这样，他那个小队的工作就走在前面了。因为“千斤担子万人挑”，担子轻了，跑得快了。如果所有的生产小队长都像杨立钧同志那样做工作，何愁“千斤担子”？ 就是“万吨担子”也不怕！
    怎样才能做到“千斤担子万人挑”？杨立钧的经验是一带（带头干）、二帮（帮助下面解决具体问题）、三检查（检查工作进行情况）。杨立钧用这种办法培养了“五虎上将”等一批积极分子。各级党组织为什么不可以用这种办法培养出千千万万的杨立钧呢？这种一带、二帮、三检查的方法，是一竿子扎到底的工作方法。“带”，要到生产队、小队里去“带”；“帮”，要到生产队、小队去“帮”；“检查”，要到生产队、小队去“检查”。简单地说，要面向基层，到人民群众中去！
    为什么有的地方没有让党的政策直接跟群众见面？这和这些地方的工作人员的思想作风有没有关系？比方说，要全面地抓思想，抓生产，抓生活，这是广大社员的基本要求，也是他们的迫切要求，上级党组织说过多少遍，为什么有的生产队、小队不照办，或者在办的当中大大地打了折扣？这些问题是值得我们动动脑筋的。
    看看枣阳县的这三个生产小队的经验吧！说实话，这三个生产小队，各有所长，各有所短，把这三个生产小队的经验集中起来，就是一套组织集体生产和生活的经验。这一套经验里面没有任何神秘的东西。如果说得朴素一点，就是两句话：一句话是照群众的要求办事，一句话是照党的政策办事。党的政策和群众的要求是一致的，听党的话和听群众的话是一致的。这三个小队的工作之所以得到比较显著的成绩，这就是在这里工作的干部，听了党的话，听了群众的话。
    听党的话，听群众的话，不能把它当作抽象的形容词，不能让它只是作为一个主观的愿望，而是要把这句话贯彻到实际行动中去，这就是说要在组织生产、生活的具体工作中，反映党的政策和群众的要求。像中店的杨立钧同志那样，像三里庙的三个老头那样，像檀家湾的檀恕生那样，爱社如家，以社为家，只要对人民有利的事什么都管，什么都干；上管天、下管地，只认理、不认人，全心全意为人民！这样，就可以“一竿子扎到底”了。
    让同志们重视枣阳县的这三个小队的经验，让同志们在自己的工作地区总结这样的经验，让同志们检查一下党的路线、方针、政策是不是已经在你们那里的人民群众中生根、开花、结果了？党和群众当前向你们提出的许多具体的要求，是否已经兑现，如何进一步兑现？关键在于改进领导作风，在于面向基层，到生产队去，到生产小队去，到田间去，到食堂去，到人民群众中去，一竿子扎到底！
