Rational Layout is a Strategic Measure for Agricultural Production
    ——An Investigation of the Agricultural Production Layout of the Patriotic Commune
    Feng Lin, First Secretary of the Shou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anhui Province
    (I)
    In accordance with the spirit of the Party's General Line, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on us to make layouts that greatly save labor in production and construction. This instruction is of great significance for improving labor productivity and accelerating the pace of construction. Recently, we conducted some investigations on the issue of agricultural production layout in the Patriotic Commune. Through these investigations, we have further realized that rational layout is indeed a strategic measure that greatly saves labor input, universally improves productivity, and achieves "less effort, more production," and it is a problem that urgently needs to be solved.
    Judging from the original natural and economic geographical conditions of the Patriotic Commune, agricultural production urgently needs rational layout. In terms of basic construction, this commune has 200,000 mu of cultivated land, with only two small rivers originally. In the past, water conservancy construction did not pay attention to layout, only focusing on low-lying plains and neglecting high hills and ridges. After liberation, although more than 5 million cubic meters of earthwork was done for water conservancy projects, the irrigation area was still less than 70,000 mu. At the same time, because the water routes are low, most of the irrigation requires water lifting. If a canal is built in the high hills and ridges of Pengcheng, Huangwei, and Dongyue brigades, natural irrigation alone can reach 130,000 mu, and the entire project would only require 3 million cubic meters of earthwork. In the use of water routes, there are also extremely unreasonable phenomena. For example, the Xuwai Brigade could have used the Tanghe River for irrigation, with most water lifting requiring only two or three stages, and some could even irrigate fields directly at the river mouth. However, because this water system belongs to the Zhongxing Brigade, according to the old rule of "water follows the old path," the Xuwai Brigade had to lift water from the Pei River, which is ten li away, using twenty-five stages. In addition, the commune has 21,000 mu of remote and barren fields more than four li away from the villages. Due to the irrational layout of villages, threshing grounds, pig farms, and labor, the amount of labor used is several times or even dozens of times higher than that for nearby fields. As a result, these remote and barren fields receive little fertilization and management, which directly affects the transformation of low-yielding fields.
    In terms of crop layout, due to the influence of the old operating methods of the small-scale peasant economy, many places still adopt the "peddler" operating method, failing to plant in large areas according to local conditions. Some even plant rice in dry land and peanuts in paddy fields, resulting in failure to fully utilize the potential of the land, labor-intensive management, and reduced harvests. In addition, due to the influence of the old administrative divisions, the interplanting of land between teams is also very serious. According to statistics, the commune has more than 20,000 mu of interplanted land. For example, 2,000 mu of land belonging to the Xuwai Brigade is inserted into the heart of the Qinglong Brigade. When the Xuwai Brigade manages it, they have to travel back and forth ten li. If it is handed over to the Qinglong Brigade for management, it is generally only one or two li. All of this undeniably shows that agricultural production must pay attention to rational layout.
    (II)
    Are there conditions for rational layout? Facts have proved that the people's commune, this new type of organization, has provided extremely important prerequisites for rational layout. This is because: First, the people's commune breaks through the boundaries of small townships and small cooperatives and can reasonably resolve the contradictions between teams, which is conducive to the rational layout of production. For example, in 1958, the Zhongxing Brigade in the upper reaches of the Tanghe River, in order to protect its own 50 mu of land from flooding, did not allow the Guanyin Brigade in the lower reaches to build a dam, causing the Guanyin Brigade's nearly 20,000 mu of rice to suffer drought and reduced production. After communization in 1959, the Zhongxing Brigade voluntarily sacrificed 60 mu of land and even sent labor to help the Guanyin Brigade build a dam to block water. Other problems such as the old unreasonable water routes can also be rationally adjusted. Second, the people's commune can carry out rational crop layout according to local conditions, achieving continuous planting. This makes it possible to completely change the previous phenomenon of scattered, piecemeal operations and fully tap the potential of the land. Third, the people's commune has a large family and a large business, so it is possible and has the strength to proceed from an overall perspective and rationally lay out farmland capital construction. For example, in the past, water conservancy construction only focused on small ditches and canals in the plains. After communization, it is possible to eliminate the water conservancy dead corners in the high hills and ridges from a global perspective and expand the area of gravity irrigation. Many supporting projects for large-scale culverts and large-scale transformation of remote and barren land, projects that were difficult for small townships and small cooperatives to carry out in the past, can now be solved by the people's commune in terms of manpower and materials.
    (III)
    The scope of rational layout of production is very broad. From the practical experience of this commune, the key layout should currently focus on basic construction, land, crops, seasonal cropping, and labor.
    In the layout of basic construction, this commune, based on the principle of combining needs and possibilities, current practicality and long-term construction, focuses on grasping the two main keys of building a water network and fertilizer stations at the field head, and accordingly carries out the rational layout of commune-run industries, roads, and threshing grounds. In water conservancy, they focus on two points: one is to grasp the water conservancy dead corners in the high hills and ridges, so that water flows to high places; the other is to adjust the old water routes. The entire terrain of this commune is higher around the periphery and a plain in the middle. According to this characteristic, after communization, this commune dug a ten-li-long main canal from the high hills and ridges of the Huangwei, Pengcheng, and other brigades, and plans to dig another Mubei branch canal from the south. These two canals can surround and run through the entire high hills and ridges of the commune, flowing through eleven brigades. When completed, all 200,000 mu of land in the commune can basically achieve gravity irrigation. In this way, 910,000 workdays of water lifting can be saved annually. Secondly, the thousands of large and small water routes left over from the small-scale peasant economy and the original small teams and small cooperatives are limited by the original administrative divisions and operating scope, and there are many unreasonable phenomena in terms of water use. After communization, some adjustments were also made, but the problems were not fully resolved. Due to the irrationality of the water routes, a large amount of labor is consumed every year. According to the investigation by the Yandian Brigade, 80 of the 220 water routes in this team were unreasonable in use and flow direction. Based on the principle of local subordination to the whole, small interests subordination to large interests, and rational water use and water conservation, this commune comprehensively adjusted the old water routes and completely changed the previous unreasonable water system. Taking only the change from using Pei River water to using Tang River water in the Xuwai Brigade as an example, the annual labor saved is no less than 70,000 workdays.
    Building fertilizer stations scattered across the fields is an important measure to save labor input and transform remote and barren land. Because the amount of fertilizer applied to cultivated land has increased, the amount of labor used for collecting and transporting fertilizer has also increased by two times compared with before communization. Generally, each laborer spends more than 30% of their total workdays each year on collecting and transporting fertilizer, especially the labor used for transporting fertilizer to transform remote and barren land is even greater. The Dongyue Brigade has 3,000 mu of remote and barren land, averaging more than three to five li away. The strongest laborer can only transport 15 loads of fertilizer per day. At 300 loads per mu, the labor for transporting fertilizer alone requires 20 workdays per mu. In response, the commune's layout strategy is to build fertilizer cellars at the field head, pig farms in remote fields, and fertilizer plants near the fields, using livestock to fertilize the fields and using sheds (duck and goose sheds) to fertilize the fields, so as to accumulate and apply fertilizer locally. Over the past year, the commune has built 9,600 field-head fertilizer cellars, 172 large and small pig farms, and 157 native fertilizer plants, reaching one pig farm per 1,160 mu, one fertilizer cellar per 20 mu, and one fertilizer plant per 1,000 mu. Secondly, this commune also built 502 threshing grounds locally, 12 grain depots near highways and waterways, 3 commodity production bases, and 3 commune-run industries near raw materials and transportation, which also greatly saved labor input.
    In the layout of land and crops, they focus on adopting two methods: one is to plant in large areas according to local conditions; the other is to adjust interplanted land. In 1959, this commune adopted the method of zoned management and continuous planting. According to the requirements of the national plan and the commune's soil quality, water conservancy, labor, and other conditions, it divided the commune's 200,000 mu of land into 13 planting areas for rice, sweet potatoes, cotton, oil crops, miscellaneous grains, and other economic crops. The area of each crop area is generally around 10,000 mu, and the smallest is also 3,000 mu. The advantages of doing so are: (1) Due to rational arrangement according to local conditions, the area of high-yield crops such as rice and sweet potatoes in 1959 increased by more than 40,000 mu compared with before communization. After 12,000 mu of dry land originally planted with food crops in the Aiguo and Zhongxing brigades were converted to rice, the average yield increased by 45% compared with 1958. In the eastern high hills and ridges, the average yield almost doubled because rice was converted to sweet potatoes. (2) It ensures the completion of the national production plan. In 1958, because there was no planting plan for crops, the commune failed to complete the state-allocated planting plans for cotton and oil crops. Last year, with zoned planting, both exceeded the state plan. (3) Zoned and centralized planting facilitates management and greatly saves labor. For example, growing rice in the eastern high hills and ridges requires lifting water for irrigation in more than a dozen stages every year. After converting to sweet potatoes, the labor for irrigation is greatly reduced. In the past, scattered planting required a lot of labor for travel. After continuous planting, the labor for travel is reduced accordingly. (4) Continuous planting is conducive to organizing collaboration and cultivating the professional skills of commune members. It has a certain effect on promoting farmland capital construction, further implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and realizing garden-style farming. Through adjustment, the interplanted land between teams also greatly reduced labor input. Commune members reflected: "In the past, we only worked half a day a day, and running errands took up more time than working. Now, we run fewer errands and waste less time, and we can do a full day's work in the morning."
    Whether the seasonal cropping layout is rational or not also has a direct impact on adjusting busy and slack periods and improving labor productivity. According to past situations, there are usually two contradictions: one is that the cropping cannot be staggered, agricultural work is concentrated, and the multiple cropping index is small; the other is that grain competes with oil crops and grain competes with cotton for land. For example, if the spring sowing area is small, the summer planting area will inevitably increase. If the early rice area is small, the mid-season rice area will be large. Every year, it is a "wheat-connected rice seedling," and agricultural work cannot be handled in time. At the same time, the transplanting and harvesting of early rice are delayed, and double-season late rice cannot be guaranteed a good harvest. In order to solve these contradictions, they adopted the following methods in the arrangement of seasons and cropping: (1) Expand the spring sowing area, especially the early rice area, and advance the transplanting, so as to stagger the cropping, strive to harvest one more crop, expand the multiple cropping index, and at the same time reduce the pressure of agricultural work during the double rush. The spring sowing area of the commune this year has expanded by four times, and the early rice area has expanded by more than sixteen times. (2) Make full use of agricultural work gaps and complete the agricultural work that can be done in advance before the busy season. For example, doing spring work in winter, doing summer work in spring, ridging sweet potatoes in advance, transporting fertilizer in advance, etc., dispersing the concentrated work, and reducing the amount of labor in the busy season from all aspects. (3) Vigorously promote intercropping and interplanting. Doing so can effectively solve the contradiction of grain competing with oil crops and grain competing with cotton for land. For example, spring intercropping of peanuts, intercropping of wheat and cotton, and intercropping of sweet potatoes and sesame can stagger some agricultural work, so that the harvesting and planting will not be too busy before the busy season. (4) Advance seedling cultivation. For example, promoting corn seedling transplanting, cotton square seedling cultivation, and nutrient pots can also effectively solve the contradiction of seasonal cropping. (5) Adjust the cropping from the perspective of varieties. For example, using Nantao No. for early rice for two consecutive crops and promoting direct sowing of late rice; using Laolaiqing for wheat stubble rice will help solve the contradiction of concentrated agricultural work during summer harvesting and summer planting and autumn harvesting and autumn planting.
    It is also very important to do a good job in the rational layout of labor, especially after realizing garden-style farming, regionalization of crops, and large-scale transformation of remote and barren land. Before new residential points have been built, it is even more important to properly deploy forces. Several relatively successful practices of this commune are: (1) Establishing remote field professional teams. Establishing remote field farming points. The commune has established eight remote field professional teams with a total of more than 1,100 people (excluding temporary ones) to strengthen the transformation of remote and barren land; (2) Adjusting residential points to appropriately concentrate villages that are too scattered; (3) Mobilizing more than 530 urban residents from towns and cities to supplement brigades with more land and weaker forces; (4) Organizing large-scale collaboration between professional team work areas and adopting a combination of large-scale operations and small-team assaults to support neighboring teams.
    With the rational layout of agricultural production, commercial networks and some welfare facilities have also been adjusted and improved in layout, starting from serving production.
    From the preliminary investigation of this commune, rational layout has not only played a certain role in promoting increased production, saving labor input, and improving labor productivity, but also greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. They reflected: Through the rational layout of production, there are more ways to work cleverly, there is a greater certainty of increasing production, and there is more energy for production. Now, this commune is further adjusting on the basis of the original layout so that the layout is more practical, more rational, and more in line with the requirements of "less effort, more production, and faster production increase."

    合理布局是农业生产的一项战略措施
    ——关于爱国公社农业生产布局的调查
    中共安徽寿县县委第一书记　冯林
    （一）
    中共安徽省委根据党的总路线的精神，号召我们在生产建设中作出大大节省劳动力的布局。这一指示，对提高劳动生产率，加快建设速度，具有十分重大的意义。最近，我们在爱国公社对农业生产布局问题做了一些调查，通过调查，使我们进一步认识到，合理布局确是一个大大节省劳动用量，普遍提高生产率，“花力少，增产大”的战略措施，是当前一个急待解决的问题。
    从爱国公社原有的自然地理、经济地理概况来看，农业生产是极需要进行合理布局的。在基本建设方面，这个社共有二十万亩耕地，原来只有两道小河，以往在兴修水利中没有注意布局，只注意低处平原，没有重视高岗丘陵，解放后，虽然做了五百多万方土的水利工程，但是灌溉面积还不到七万亩；同时因为水路低，大部分还要提水灌溉。如果在彭城、黄圩、东岳等大队的高岗地区修一条水渠，居高临下，仅自然灌溉就可以达到十三万亩，整个工程只要三百万方土。在水路的使用上，也存在着极不合理的现象，比如许圩大队本来可以利用塘河水灌溉，提水大部分只要二、三道手，有的还可以就口上田，但由于这道水系归众兴大队所有，根据“水归旧路”的陈规，许圩大队不得不从远在十华里外的沛河用二十五道手来提水灌田。另外，如全社有二万一千亩远离村庄四华里以外的远田薄地，由于村庄、谷场、猪场、劳力布局的不合理，所以所用的劳动量都高于近田的几倍，以至几十倍以上。因而这些远田薄地很少施肥管理，这就直接影响到低产田的改造。
    在作物的布局上，由于小农经济旧有经营方式的影响，很多地方仍然采取“货郎担”的经营方式，不能因地制宜合理成片种植，个别的甚至旱地种水稻，水田种花生，结果不能充分发挥土地的潜力，管理费工，收成减少。另外，由于旧有行政区划的影响，在队与队之间，土地插花的情况也很严重。据统计，全社有插花田二万多亩，如许圩大队二千亩土地插在青龙大队心脏地区，许圩大队管理时要往返跑十华里，如果交给青龙大队管理，一般只有一、二华里。凡此种种，都无可争辩地说明了农业生产必须注意合理布局。
    （二）
    有没有条件进行合理布局呢？事实证明，人民公社这个新型的组织形式，已经为合理布局提供了极其重要的先决条件。这是因为：第一，人民公社突破了小乡小社的界线，能够合理解决队与队之间的矛盾，因而就有利于生产的合理布局。比如1958年塘河上游的众兴大队为保全本队五十亩土地不受涝，不准下游的观音大队拦河建坝，使下游的观音大队近二万亩水稻受旱减产。公社化后的1959年，众兴大队则自动牺牲六十亩土地，还抽出劳力帮助观音大队筑坝拦水。其它如旧有的不合理的水路也就有可能进行合理调整。第二，人民公社可以因地制宜地进行作物的合理布局，做到连片种植。这就有可能彻底改变以往零敲碎打、“碟占碗也占”的现象，充分发挥土地的潜力。第三，人民公社家大业大，因而也就有可能、有力量从全面出发，合理地进行农田基本建设的布局。比如以往兴修水利，只注意平原地区的小沟小渠，公社化以后，就可以从全局出发，来消灭高岗和丘陵地区的水利死角，扩大自流灌溉面积。很多大型涵闸的配套工程，以及大规模的远田薄地的改造工作，原来小乡小社难以进行的工程项目，现在人民公社都能从人力上、物质上解决这些问题。
    （三）
    生产的合理布局的范围很广，从这个社的实践经验来看，当前首先应该做好基本建设、土地、作物、季节茬口和劳力等几项关键性的布局。
    在基本建设的布局上，这个社根据需要与可能、当前实用和长远性建设相结合的原则，着重抓住建设水网化、田头肥料站两大主要关键，并相应地进行了社办工业以及道路、谷场的合理布局。在水利上，他们抓住两点：一是抓高岗地区的水利死角，做到水往高处流；一是调整旧有水路，这个社的整个地势是四周较高，中部平原。根据这个特点，公社化后，这个社从黄圩、彭城等大队的高岗地带开挖了十华里的干渠，并计划从南部再开挖一道木北支渠，这两个渠道，可以环绕和贯穿全社的整个高岗地带，流经十一个大队。全部完工以后，全社二十万亩土地基本上可以全部实现自流灌溉。这样，全年就可以节省提水用工九十一万个。其次在小农经济和原来的小队、小社遗留下来千百条大大小小的水路，受着原来行政区划和经营范围的限制，在用水方面存在着很多不合理的现象。公社化以后，也进行了一些调整，但没有全面地解决问题。由于水路不合理，每年都要耗费大量的劳力。据阎店大队的调查，这个队原有二百二十条水路就有八十条使用和流向不合理。这个社本着局部服从整体、小利益服从大利益，以及合理用水、节约用水的原则，全面调整了旧有水路，彻底改变了以往不合理的水系。仅以许圩大队由用沛河水改用塘河水一项计算，每年节约的用工就不下七万个。
    在田头星罗棋布地建设肥料站，这是节省劳动用量、改造远田薄地的一条重要措施。因为耕地施肥量增加，目前积肥、运肥的用工量也比公社化前增加了两倍，而每个劳力每年用于积肥运肥的工，一般都要占到出工总数的30％以上，特别是改造远田薄地的运肥用工更大。东岳大队有三千亩远田薄地平均在三至五华里以上，一个最强的劳力每天也只能运到十五担肥，每亩以三百担计算，仅运肥工每亩就要二十个工作日。对此，公社在布局上采取的办法是田头建肥窖、远田建猪场，就田兴建肥料厂，以畜就田，以棚（鸭鹅棚）就田，做到就地积，就地施。一年来全社建田头肥窖九千六百个，大小猪场一百七十二个，土化肥厂一百五十七个，达到一千一百六十亩一个猪场，二十亩一个肥窖，千亩一个肥厂。其次这个公社还就地建谷场五百零二处，就公路就河道建粮仓十二处，商品生产基地三处，就原料就交通建立社办工业三处，也都大大地节约了劳动用量。
    在土地和作物布局上，他们着重采取两个办法，一是因地制宜，连片种植；一是调整插花地。1959年这个社采取了划方经营连片种植的办法，根据国家计划要求，以及本社土质、水利、劳力等条件，因地制宜地将全社二十万亩土地分别划为水稻、山芋、棉花、油料、杂粮和其他经济作物等十三个种植区，每个作物区的面积一般都在万亩左右，最小的也有三千亩，这样做的好处是：（一）由于因地制宜，合理安排，1959年水稻、山芋等高产作物面积就比公社化前扩大了四万多亩。爱国、众兴等大队一万二千亩原种旱粮的水田改种水稻以后，较1958年平均增产45％。东部高岗地区由于水稻改为山芋，平均增产近一倍。（二）保证了国家生产计划的完成，1958年由于没有制订作物的种植规划，全社棉花、油料作物都没有完成国家分配的种植计划，去年划片种植，两者都超额完成了国家计划。（三）划片集中种植，便于管理，大大地节省了用工。如东部高岗地区种水稻每年需要十几道手提水灌溉，改种山芋以后，灌溉用工就大大减少。往年分散种植，往返费工很大，连片种植以后，往返用工就相应减少。（四）连片种植有利于组织协作，培养社员的专业技术，对促进农田的基本建设，对更具体地贯彻农业八字宪法，对实现园田化都具有一定的作用。队与队之间的插花土地，通过调整，用工也大大减少。社员反映说：“从前一天只干半天活，干活没有跑路多，现在是少跑路少耽搁，一早抵干一天活。”
    季节茬口布局合理与否，对调剂闲忙，提高劳动生产率，也有直接关系。根据以往情况，通常存在两个矛盾：一个是茬口错不开，农活集中，复种指数小；一个是粮和油、粮和棉争地。如春播面积小，夏种面积势必增加，早稻面积小，中稻面积大，年年是“麦连秧”，农活忙不开。同时，早稻栽插和收割推迟，双季晚稻就不能保收。为解决这些矛盾，他们在季节和茬口安排上，采取以下办法：（一）扩大春播面积，特别是扩大早稻面积，提前栽插，这样可以错开茬口，力争多收一季，扩大复种指数，同时可以减轻双抢中的农活压力。全社今年春播扩大了四倍，早稻扩大十六倍多。（二）充分利用农活空隙，把在大忙前可以提前做的农活提前做好。比如春活冬干，夏活春干，山芋提前扶垅，提前运肥等等，化集中为分散，从各方面来减少大忙中的用工量。（三）大搞套种和间种，这样做可以有效地解决粮油、粮棉争地的矛盾。如春套花生，麦棉间作，山芋套芝麻等，就可以把一部分农活错开，在大忙以前不致收种忙成一片。（四）提前育苗。如推行玉米育苗移栽，棉花方块育苗以及营养钵等，也都有效地解决了季节茬口的矛盾。（五）从品种上来调剂茬口。如早稻用南特号，两季连作，推广晚稻直接播种；麦茬稻用老来青，都有助于解决夏收夏种和秋收秋种中农活集中的矛盾。
    搞好劳力合理布局也十分重要，特别是在实现耕作园田化，作物区域化，以及在大规模进行远田薄地改造以后，在新的居民点还没有兴建以前，恰当地摆布兵力就显得更加重要。这个社的几项比较成功的做法是：（一）成立远田专业队。建立远田耕作点。全社建立远田专业队八个，共一千一百多人（不包括临时的），来加强对远田薄地的改造；（二）调整居民点，使过于分散的村庄适当集中；（三）从集镇动员市民五百三十多人，充实到土地多、兵力弱的大队；（四）组织专业队作业区之间的大协作和采取大兵团作战与小队突击相结合的办法，支援友邻队。
    随着农业生产的合理布局，商业网和一些福利设施，也从为生产服务出发，同时进行了调整，改进了布局。
    从这个社初步的调查来看，合理布局不仅对促进增产，节约劳动用量，提高劳动生产率发挥了一定作用，同时也大大地鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。他们反映：通过生产的合理布局，巧干的门路更多了，增产的把握更大了，生产劲头也更足了。现在这个社正在原有布局的基础上进一步进行调整，以便使布局更实际，更合理，更符合于“花力小，增产大，增产快”的要求。
