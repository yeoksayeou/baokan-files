    Tea House Technical Exchange Meeting
    After a hard day's work, the master craftsmen like to sit in the tea house, drink tea, chat, and exchange technical experience. The leaders of our factory, in order to allow the master craftsmen to rest better, set up a tea house in our own factory.
    Among our master craftsmen, Master Cen Ji is the most fond of sitting in the tea house. Whether it is sunny or rainy, unless there is an urgent task in the factory that he cannot get away from, he always goes to the tea house to sit after work. He often jokingly says to us: "Youngsters, don't look down on us old folks for liking to sit in the tea house, it is of great benefit to production! Several old fellows sit down, you say a word, I say a word, chattering away, talking about everything from life to production, talking about everything under the sun. Sometimes, we get to talking about production, it's just like holding a technical research meeting. Several times, a problem that I had been thinking about for days without solving was solved with a word of reminder from someone."
    Since the opening of the tea house, every night, under the shade of the trees next to our cultural classroom, you can see bright lights, workers leaning on bamboo chairs, chatting and discussing technical issues in small groups. Some are playing chess, playing cards, reading picture books, or enjoying music. The master craftsmen brew a pot of fragrant tea, pour a glass of factory-made soda, and completely forget the fatigue of the day.

### 茶馆技术交流会

    茶馆技术交流会
    一天辛勤劳动之后，老师傅们都喜欢到茶馆去坐一坐，一边喝茶，一边聊天，交流技术经验。我们厂的领导同志，为了使老师傅们能休息得更好，就在我们自己厂里办了个茶社。
    在我们的老师傅中间，要算岑基师傅最爱坐茶馆了。不论天晴或下雨，除非厂里有紧急任务，脱不开身，他总是下班后到茶馆里坐坐。他经常半开玩笑地对我们说：“小伙子们，别看我们老头爱坐茶馆，对生产还有很大的好处呢！几个老伙计坐下来，你一言我一语的，七嘴八舌，从生活谈到生产，天南海北无所不谈，有时一扯就扯到生产上去，简直像开技术研究会一样。有几次，我想了几天都没解决的问题，给人家一句话提醒，一下子就解决了。”
    自从茶社开幕以来，每天晚上，在我们的文化教室旁边的一片树荫下，只见灯火通明，工人们靠在竹椅上，三三两两地在聊天、讨论技术问题。也有的在下棋、打扑克、看小人书或欣赏音乐。老师傅们泡上一盅香片茶，倒上一杯厂里自制的汽水，完全忘掉了一天的疲劳。
