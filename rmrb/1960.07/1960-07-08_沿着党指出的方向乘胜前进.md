    Advance Victoriously Along the Direction Pointed Out by the Party
    Xu Chenglong, Deputy Director and Engineer of Qingdao Wood Comprehensive Processing Factory
    Our factory completed half of the year's plan as early as May 11th. At the same time, we also helped nine fraternal units including Qingdao Cigarette Factory, Paper Mill, and Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and solved some key production problems.
    From the fourth quarter of last year to now, the Party has given me many opportunities to study: I was honored to attend the National Congress of Heroes, and this year I also participated in the technical revolution promotion group organized by the Ministry of Forestry of the Central Government, as well as various advanced experience exchange meetings. Through the above activities, I have learned many advanced experiences. I think it is my bounden duty to quickly promote these advanced experiences. In February of this year, the Taitung District Committee and the factory Party Committee asked me to help the Qingdao Cigarette Factory solve the problem of using cigarette stems to make cigarette silk. I happily accepted this task and immediately went to the cigarette factory to study with the master craftsmen. However, after many studies, it was still unsuccessful. I took a pack of cigarette stems from the cigarette factory with me and studied them wherever I went. Later, from the fact that cigarette stems contain fiber, I thought about whether a fiber separator could be used to cut them into cigarette silk in one go. With the support of the Party Committee and the help of the master craftsmen, the cigarette stem silk separator was finally successfully developed, and the produced cigarette silk fully met the specifications.
    At a meeting, I heard that the drying cylinder temperature of the paper machine in Qingdao Paper Mill could only reach 140 degrees Celsius. Due to the low temperature, the paper drying time was long, and the output could not be increased, which became a concern for the paper mill workers. After the meeting, I immediately rushed to the Qingdao Paper Mill and studied with the workers to design a hot air reflecting furnace, which increased the drying cylinder temperature from the original 140 degrees to 180 degrees. The output of the paper machine can be increased by ten meters per minute, and the moisture content is reduced, and the quality is improved.
    The first half of the year has passed victoriously, and the second half of the year is the decisive moment to complete the leap forward plan. I want to work with all the workers in the factory, advance victoriously along the direction pointed out by the Party. In the second half of the year, I plan to continue to work with the workers of fraternal factories to install the production equipment of the cigarette stem silk separator into remote control, and according to the needs of production development, complete 100 single-machine automation and innovation projects such as the eight-foot large rotary peeling machine, double-sided multi-head automatic drilling machine, automatic tenoning machine, and automatic flat planing machine, and on the basis of existing innovations, realize continuous and automated production of complex process processing. In addition, in the second half of the year, I also plan to compile the structure and use of a set of locally-made machine tools such as wood board seaming machines, four-sided drilling machines, universal wheel sawing machines, and short fiber asbestos spinning machines into technical books for reference by fraternal factories in various places.

### 沿着党指出的方向乘胜前进

    沿着党指出的方向乘胜前进
    青岛木材综合加工厂副厂长兼工程师　徐呈龙
    我们厂早在5月11日就完成了全年计划一半的任务。与此同时，我们还帮助青岛卷烟厂、造纸厂、四方机车车辆厂等九个兄弟单位，解决了部分生产关键问题。
    从去年第四季度到现在，党给了我很多学习的机会：我光荣的出席了全国群英会，今年又先后参加了中央林业部组织的技术革命促进团，及各种先进经验交流会。通过上述活动，使我学习到许多先进经验。我想，把这些先进经验迅速推广开来，是自己义不容辞的职责。今年2月份，台东区委和厂党委要我去帮助青岛卷烟厂解决利用烟梗制烟丝的设备。我高兴地接受了这个任务，立即到卷烟厂和老师傅们一起研究。但是，研究了多次，总是不成功。我就从烟厂要来一包烟梗带在身上，走到哪里研究到哪里。后来从烟梗里含有纤维这件事连想到是否可用纤维分离机一次割成烟丝的问题。在党委的支持和老师傅们的帮助下，到底研究成功了烟梗分丝机，生产出的烟丝完全合乎规格。
    在一次会议上，我听到青岛造纸厂的造纸机烘缸温度只能达到一百四十度，由于温度低，纸的干燥时间长，产量老是提不高，成了造纸厂职工的心事。会后，我立即赶到青岛造纸厂和职工们一块研究，设计成功了一个热风反射炉，使烘缸温度由原来一百四十度提高到一百八十度，造纸机的产量每分钟可提高十米，并且降低了含水率，提高了质量。
    上半年已经胜利的度过了，下半年是完成跃进计划的决定时刻，我要和全厂职工一道，沿着党所指引的方向，乘胜前进。下半年，我准备继续和兄弟厂职工们一块研究，把烟梗分丝机的生产设备安装成远距离操纵，并根据生产发展的需要，完成八尺大旋皮机、双面多头自动打眼机、自动开榫机、自动平刨机等百项单机自动和革新项目，在现有革新的基础上，使复杂的工艺加工过程，实现连续化和自动化的生产。另外，在下半年内，我还准备把木板对缝机、四面打眼机、万能轮锯机、短纤维石棉纺纱机等一套土造机床的构造与使用编写成技术书籍，以便供给各地兄弟厂参考。
