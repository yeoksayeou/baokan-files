Combining revolutionary drive and a practical approach will conquer difficulties and achieve invincibility
    Henan and Shandong fight drought, rush planting, and strive for autumn harvest

    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 30th dispatch) The drought resistance struggle in Henan Province has entered a new stage. In areas where rush planting has basically ended, the broad masses, with a spirit of continuous revolution, are making a concentrated effort to finish up, vigorously shifting to seedling inspection, replanting, and drought-resistant seedling protection movements; in areas where rush planting has not yet ended, the entire party and all the people are engaged in a major battle to eliminate blind spots in water conservancy, ensuring that in the face of severe drought, not a single inch of land is yielded, and making every effort to rush planting, plant sufficiently, and plant well. As of the 27th, the province's summer sowing area has accounted for more than 79% of the planned area.

    Luoyang Special District is the area with the most severe drought in the province. Since the autumn drought in July of last year, there has been little rain and snow, and water source conditions are very difficult. However, the severe drought has not made the vast cadres and masses of Luoyang Special District succumb. All localities have widely mobilized the masses to summarize water-finding experience, adapt to local conditions to bring water up the mountains, vigorously engage the "Four Groups" (reservoir group, machine group, waterwheel group, carrying pole group) and implement the "Five Waters Returning to the Fields" (reservoirs, canals, wells, ponds, springs), expanding the irrigated area. Linru County extracted seven thousand strong laborers to form a professional team. On the forty-five-li-long "Tiger and Wolf Climb" ridge, they built motorized wells and earthen wells, combating drought and rush-planting more than 50,000 mu, completing more than 70% of the plan. The people of drought-stricken areas such as Xuchang Special District and Xinxiang Special District are even more confident, and have also achieved great success in combating drought and rush planting.

    In order to speed up the rush planting in areas with difficult water sources, many areas have adopted a highly concentrated method of centralized leadership, centralized labor, centralized tools, and centralized water use. In Nanzhao and Xixia counties of Nanyang Special District, some production brigades had difficulties in fighting drought and rush planting, and progress was slow. County and commune leaders transferred cadres and members from areas with good water source conditions and where summer sowing tasks had basically ended, bringing their own tools to provide support, and rush-planted more than 100,000 mu in two days. In Kaifeng County of Kaifeng Special District, led by the three secretaries of the county party committee, more than 1,000 cadres were transferred, and strong laborers were concentrated to fight a major battle on the three sandbar highlands of the Yellow River, Huiji River, and Zhuxian Town, so that these high beach areas were irrigated in a timely manner and planted with late autumn crops.

    At present, areas that have basically completed the summer sowing task are further adjusting labor, developing water sources, and launching seedling inspection and replanting, and drought-resistant seedling protection movements. At the same time, Nanyang, Xinyang, Xuchang and other special districts are also making every effort to expand the planting area and plant more high-yield crops, striving for a bumper harvest this autumn.

    (Our newspaper Jinan, 30th dispatch) If the drought increases by one point, the enthusiasm will increase by ten zhang. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members in Shandong are competing with the heavens with unwavering spirit, determined to defeat the drought demon, plant wheat stubble land well, and protect spring seedlings. As of June 25, nearly 32 million mu of the province's more than 68 million mu of summer sowing tasks have been completed, more than 2 million mu faster than last year's progress.

    The drought in Shandong Province has been continuously developing. The severity of the drought is rare in decades. But the heroic people of Shandong have not yielded. Under the leadership of the Party, relying on the powerful force of the people's commune, and using long-accumulated drought resistance experience, they have shown the ambition to "not compromise with the heavens and must make the Dragon King bow their heads", and are tenaciously fighting. In the drought resistance movement, they discussed while working, and through "several inspections, several comparisons, and several calculations," they used the experience gained from the victory of two years of drought resistance, so the masses fought stronger and stronger, and their confidence grew greater and greater. New and old water conservancy projects have played a greater role in drought resistance. More than 90% of the summer fields sown in Jining Special District were planted using water from wells, reservoirs, ponds, springs, etc. In the most severely drought-stricken areas, the masses, on the one hand, gave full play to the effectiveness of existing water conservancy, and on the other hand, opened up new water sources and continuously expanded the irrigated area. Heze Special District newly drilled 500 motorized wells, renovated 30,000 old wells, found water under 20,000 wells, and intercepted 700 underground streams. In some mountainous and hilly areas with extremely scarce water sources, the people's fighting spirit is even stronger. With the help of relevant departments in the province, Gangjingsun Village and other communes in Licheng County drilled water from a deep soil layer of 250 meters. Wu Village Commune in Qufu County combined well, river, and spring water to irrigate from a distance, cutting ridges, building bridges when encountering ditches, and bringing water to the mountain ridge 50 meters high to plant sweet potatoes and corn.

    In the drought resistance struggle, cadres went to the most tense places of drought, the most difficult places, and to the forefront of production, leading the masses in a down-to-earth manner to win the victory of drought resistance. Workers, commercial workers, and medical staff also actively supported the drought resistance struggle.

    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently further analyzed and studied the overall situation of the drought resistance struggle at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, and proposed new measures to strengthen the drought resistance struggle. Now the party committees at all levels are further mobilizing the masses, rationally arranging labor and tools, and launching a larger-scale drought resistance and rush planting struggle in accordance with the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee.

    革命干劲和踏实作风结合起来，就能征服困难无往不利
    河南山东抗旱抢种力夺秋季丰收
    本报郑州30日电　河南省抗旱斗争已经进入新的阶段。在抢种已经基本结束的地区，广大群众以不断革命的精神，正突击扫尾，大力转向查苗、补苗、抗旱保苗运动；抢种尚未结束的地区，全党全民正大战水利死角，保证在严重干旱面前，不退让一分土地，千方百计抢种、种足、种好。截至27日为止，全省夏播面积已占计划面积的79％以上。
    洛阳专区是全省旱情最严重的地区，从去年7月份秋旱以来，少雨缺雪，同时水源条件非常困难，但是严重的干旱并没有使洛阳专区的广大干部和群众屈服。各地普遍发动群众，总结找水经验，因地制宜引水上山，大搞四群（水库群、机器群、辘轳群、挑杆群）上阵、五水归田（库、渠、井、塘、泉），扩大灌溉面积。临汝县抽出七千名精壮劳力，组成专业队，在长达四十五里的“虎狼爬”岭上，兴修机井、土井，抗旱抢种五万多亩，完成计划70％以上。许昌专区、新乡专区等受旱地区人民更是信心百倍，抗旱抢种也都取得了巨大成绩。
    为了加快水源困难地区的抢种速度，很多地区都采取集中领导，集中劳力，集中工具，集中用水的大集中办法。南阳专区南召、西峡等县有的生产大队抗旱抢种有困难，进度迟缓，县社领导就从水源条件好，已经基本结束夏播任务的地区，抽调干部和社员，自带工具，突击支援，两天就抢种十万多亩。开封专区开封县由县委三个书记带领，抽调一千多名干部，集中精壮劳力，大战黄河、惠济河、朱仙镇三个沙滩高地，使这些高滩地都及时得到了灌溉，种上了晚秋作物。
    目前，已经基本完成夏播任务的地区，正进一步调整劳力，开发水源，展开查苗补苗，抗旱保苗运动。同时，南阳、信阳、许昌等专区，还千方百计扩大播种面积和多种高产作物，争取今年秋季大丰收。
    本报济南30日电　旱情增一分，干劲增一丈，山东广大社员在党的领导下，正以坚韧不拔的精神与天公比高低，决心战胜旱魔，种好麦茬地，保住春田苗。到6月25日止，全省六千八百多万亩的夏播任务已完成近三千二百万亩，比去年进度加快了二百多万亩。
    山东省的旱情一直在持续发展。旱情严重为数十年所罕有。但英雄的山东人民并未屈服。他们在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的强大威力，运用长期积累的抗旱经验，表现出“不与天公妥协，定要龙王低头”的雄心壮志，顽强地进行战斗。在抗旱运动中，边干边议，通过“几查、几比、几算”，运用两年抗旱取得胜利的经验，因而群众越战越强，信心越来越大。新老水利工程在抗旱中发挥了较大的作用。济宁专区下种的夏田，90％以上是利用了井、库、塘、泉等浇水种植。干旱最严重的地区，群众一面充分发挥现有水利的效能，一方面开辟新的水源，不断扩大浇地面积。菏泽专区新打机井五百眼，改修旧井三万眼，水井下泉二万个，截潜流七百处。在一些水源极端缺乏的山区和丘陵地带，人民的斗志更加坚强。历城县港汫孙村等公社在省有关部门的帮助下，硬从二百五十米的深土层钻出水来。曲阜县吴村公社把井、河、泉水并流远浇，见岭削岭，遇沟架桥，把水引上五十米高的山岭地，种上了地瓜和玉米。
    在抗旱斗争中，干部都到旱情最紧张的地方去，最困难的地方去，到生产的最前线去，踏踏实实地领导群众夺取抗旱的胜利。工人、商业工作者、医务人员也都积极支援抗旱的斗争。
    中共山东省委最近在常委扩大会议上，进一步分析研究了抗旱斗争的总形势，提出了加强抗旱斗争的新的措施。现在各级党委正根据省委常委扩大会议的精神，进一步发动群众，合理安排劳力和工具，掀起一个规模更大的抗旱抢种斗争。
