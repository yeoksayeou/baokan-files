Commune Letter

Editor's Note: Not long ago, Zhang Sifu, Party Branch Secretary, and Yao Siwa, Director, of the Yangcun Management Area of the Zhangqing Shuguang People's Commune in Yuci City, Shanxi Province, wrote a letter to the Party Branch Secretary and Section Chief of the Equipment and Power Section (Workshop) of the Yuci Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory, expressing on behalf of all commune members their heartfelt gratitude to the working-class elder brothers for their meticulous support. Below is the full text of the letter.

Dear Secretary Fang and Section Chief Wu:

At this crucial moment of seizing grain from the jaws of the dragon, you sent more than 330 comrades who helped us reap wheat, hoe seedlings, pull weeds, and thin cotton plants three times, giving us a great help and relieving our urgent needs. Although we are one family, and one family doesn't speak two languages, the villagers still repeatedly asked us to thank you profusely. Recalling the past few days, all kinds of work rushed in together, and the commune members were as anxious as if they were burning with kerosene. If it hadn't been for the help of the working-class elder brothers, those few days would have been really difficult!

Every time the working-class elder brothers came, it was like giving us a lesson. The first time they came, they worked from morning to afternoon without even taking a break in between. Everyone challenged each other in competition, and everyone strived to be the first. The loudspeaker kept broadcasting good news. The commune members said: Our working-class elder brothers have a fiery spirit in whatever they do. Before the second time they came, there was a torrential downpour at night, and the road was like a mud swamp. The clothes of the worker comrades were splashed with mud, and the bicycles turned into balls of mud. But they talked and laughed and didn't care at all, and even sang songs as they moved forward! The third time, they came very early. We had just gone to bed when we heard a large number of people arriving. The commune members all said: The working-class elder brothers must have been so happy last night when they heard they were coming to "visit relatives" that they didn't sleep.

Not only did they support us with manpower, but also with materials and financial resources. It has only been two months since our "factory-commune linkage," and you have helped us realize electric flour milling and mechanized canteens. Now, the small steel mill has been running for almost two months, and the flour it mills every day not only provides food for the three production teams in our management area, but also supplies the other three management areas. In the canteen, from the hand-operated water pump, water pipes, faucets, blowers, air ducts, wires, and gates to the repair of the tea stove, which one was not supported or repaired by you! Now, the canteen can use a blower for cooking; when we need water, we just turn on the faucet and the water flows into the pot with a gush. The commune members happily said: "Life is getting better and better!" In the process of realizing electrification, you supported us with electroplating meters and safety devices, helped us to set up lines, maintain and repair them, and came whenever we called, fulfilling every request, and even coming automatically without being called. Some comrades worked a full day shift and still ran to help us at night, working until three or four o'clock in the morning, sleeping on the spot with their clothes on, and then going back to work the next morning. Once, the electrician, Master Shi Xuezhong, came and heard that the motor sounded wrong, so he told us to quickly turn off the gate and said: "I'll take it to the factory and repair it for you."

A few days ago, after a big thunderstorm, the electric mill stopped and the loudspeaker was also burned out. Everyone tossed and turned but couldn't find the problem. We sent someone to ask Master Shi. Master Shi was taking a nap, but when he heard the commune calling, he brought his tools without saying a word. He disregarded the hot weather and the long distance, and wasn't afraid of the muddy roads, sacrificing his lunch break to repair the circuit for us.

Now, the factory is going to help us manufacture vegetable cutters and noodle presses, and realize the electrification of waterwheels. The commune members said: "With the factory leading the commune, we are getting richer and richer. With such enthusiasm, why worry about not building socialism!" Our two families have only been "married" for two or three months, and there have been such great changes. If it were two or three years, or twenty or thirty years, I really don't know what miracles would happen!

Secretary Fang, I heard that your hand was broken in a fall. I don't know how it's been set these days. I hope you rest and recuperate in peace and recover soon.

With
       Regards
                Zhang Sifu, Yao Siwa
                                    July 10th

    公社来信
    编者按：不久前，山西省榆次市张庆曙光人民公社杨村管理区党支部书记张四福、主任要四娃写给榆次经纬纺织机械制造厂设备动力科（车间）党支部书记、科长一封信，代表全体社员向工人老大哥对他们无微不至的支援表示衷心的感谢。下面就是这封信的全文。亲爱的方书记、吴科长：
    正在龙口夺食的节骨眼上，你们派来了三百三十多位同志，三次给我们割麦、锄苗、拔草、间棉花，帮了我们的大忙，解了我们的燃眉之急。虽然咱们是一家人，一家不说两家话，但全村群众还是一再要我们多多感谢你们。回想前几天，各样活计都一齐涌来，社员个个心焦得像火油烧心，要不是工人老大哥帮忙，那几天可真不好过啊！
    工人老大哥每一次来，都等于给我们上了一堂课。第一次来，从早上一直干到下午，中间连歇都没歇，人人挑战竞赛，个个奋勇当先，喇叭哇啦啦的一直在传捷报。社员们说：咱工人老大哥干个啥，也有股子热火劲；第二次来以前，晚上下了倾盆大雨，路上像淤泥潭。工人同志们的衣服都溅满了泥浆，自行车转成了一团泥。可是他们说说笑笑，全不在意，还唱着歌前进呢！第三次，他们来得可早啦，我们刚睡下，就听见大队人马来了。社员们都说：工人老大哥听说要来“走亲戚”，昨晚上准高兴得没有睡觉。
    不仅支援人力，还支援物力、财力。咱们“厂社挂钩”才两个多月，你们就帮助我们实现了磨面电动化、食堂机械化。如今，小钢磨运转了快两个月了，每天磨的面不仅可供我们管理区的三个生产队吃用，而且还可以供给其他三个管理区。食堂里，从手压水泵、水管、龙头、鼓风机、风筒、电线、闸门到茶炉的修理，那一件不是你们支援的或修配的啊！如今，食堂烧饭能用鼓风机；用水时，一拧水龙头，水就哗哗地流到锅里。社员们高兴地说：“生活越过越美啦！”在实现电气化过程中，你们支援我们电镀表、护甘器，帮助我们架设线路，维护检修，随叫随到，有求必应，甚至不叫就自动来了。有些同志白天上一天班，晚上还跑来给我们帮忙，一直干到三四点钟，和衣就地一睡，第二天早上，就又回去上班啦。有一次，电工组的石学忠老师傅来了，听见马达的声音不对，就叫赶快关了闸门，并说：“我带到厂里，给你们修理修理。”
    前几天，一场大雷雨过后，电磨停了，喇叭也烧坏了，大家折腾来折腾去，找不出毛病来。派人去请石师傅。石师傅正睡午觉，听见公社叫，二话没说，就带上腰表来了。他不顾天热路远，不怕泥泞难走，牺牲了中午的休息时间，给我们修通了电路。
    现在，厂里又要帮助我们制造切菜机、压面机，实现水车电动化。社员们说：“以厂带社，越活越阔。像这样鼓着劲干，何愁不能建成社会主义！”咱两家“结亲”才两三个月，就有了这么大的变化，要是两三年，二三十年，真不知要出现什么奇迹呢！
    方书记，听说你的手被摔坏了，不知这两天接得如何，望安心休养，早日全愈。
                          致以
                敬礼
                    张四福、要四娃
                                    7月10日
