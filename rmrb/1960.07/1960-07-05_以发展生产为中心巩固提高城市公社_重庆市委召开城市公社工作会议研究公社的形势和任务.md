    Consolidate and Improve Urban Communes Centered on Developing Production
    Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Holds Urban Commune Work Conference to Study the Situation and Tasks of Communes

    (According to Chongqing Daily) In order to continue to boost morale, continue the Great Leap Forward, strengthen leadership, rectify and improve, and make the urban people's communes more consolidated and soundly developed, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a work conference on urban people's communes to study the current situation and tasks of the urban people's commune movement in the city, as well as relevant guidelines and policies.

    The conference specifically analyzed the current development situation of the urban people's commune movement in Chongqing, affirmed the achievements, summarized and widely exchanged experiences, and put forward the task of rectifying and improving the urban people's communes. The meeting pointed out that the current urban people's commune movement in Chongqing has entered a new stage. The degree of organization of street residents has been greatly improved, and the development of production, livelihood, and welfare undertakings has been rapid. Under this situation, rectifying and improving the thirty-eight urban people's communes that have been established to make them more consolidated and soundly developed has become the central task of the current urban people's commune movement in Chongqing. All urban people's communes should continue to boost morale, continue the Great Leap Forward, vigorously rectify commune-run industries, vigorously promote factory-commune cooperation, vigorously promote comprehensive utilization, and vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, further implement the guideline of commune-run industries "serving state-owned factories and mines, serving suburban agriculture, and serving the needs of people's lives," actively carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

    The meeting believed that all urban people's communes should, on the basis of production development, develop and manage collective livelihood and welfare undertakings in a planned and step-by-step manner. Vigorously developing production is the central link in running urban people's communes well. In order to make the urban people's communes more consolidated and soundly developed, we must vigorously grasp the central link of developing production, and gradually improve the lives of commune members on the basis of developing production. At present, it is necessary to rectify and consolidate collective livelihood and welfare undertakings, establish and improve various management systems, and continuously improve the quality of service. It is necessary to effectively manage street public canteens to ensure that the masses eat enough, eat well, eat economically, and eat cleanly and hygienically. For nurseries, kindergartens, and children's playgrounds, especially infant rooms, we should further improve the quality of work. At present, it is especially necessary to do a good job in summer to ensure that children's summer life is healthy and happy.

    The meeting requested that all urban people's communes deeply carry out cultural revolution and conscientiously do a good job in education, culture, health, and sports. At present, the main task of cultural and educational work in urban people's communes is to consolidate the results of literacy and, on this basis, popularize higher primary schools, vigorously run mass spare-time cultural education, and rapidly improve the political, cultural, technical, and professional level of commune members to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. At the same time, we should actively run "Children's Homes" to comprehensively organize the extracurricular life of children and realize the socialization of children's education.

    In order to ensure the completion of this year's production plan and enable the urban people's communes to develop more soundly on a consolidated basis, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's leadership over the urban people's communes. On the one hand, it is necessary to widely and deeply carry out the study of Chairman Mao's works among commune members, carry out socialist and communist education campaigns, constantly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and improve the communist consciousness of commune members, and consolidate the proletarian ideological front. On the other hand, it is necessary to enrich and strengthen the cadre ranks of urban people's communes, and focus on the training of cadres, requiring leading cadres at all levels of the communes to frequently go deep into the masses, deep into the front line of production, care about the production and life of the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, consult with the masses on everything, better implement the mass line, and make the leadership work more in-depth and more down-to-earth.

    以发展生产为中心巩固提高城市公社
    重庆市委召开城市公社工作会议研究公社的形势和任务
    本报讯　据重庆日报报道：为了继续鼓干劲，继续大跃进，加强领导，整顿提高，使城市人民公社更加巩固、健全地向前发展，中共重庆市委在最近召开了城市人民公社工作会议，研究了当前本市城市人民公社化运动的形势和任务，以及有关的方针政策问题。
    这次会议具体分析了当前重庆市城市人民公社化运动发展的形势，肯定了成绩，总结和广泛交流了经验，提出了整顿提高城市人民公社的任务。会议指出，当前重庆市城市人民公社化运动已经进入了一个新的阶段。街道居民的组织程度已大大提高，生产、生活福利事业的发展很快。在这种形势下，把已经建立起来的三十八个城市人民公社加以整顿提高，使其更加巩固、健全地向前发展，已经成为当前重庆城市人民公社化运动的中心任务。各城市人民公社应继续鼓干劲，继续大跃进，大力整顿社办工业，大搞厂社协作，大搞综合利用，大搞技术革新和技术革命，进一步贯彻社办工业“为国营厂矿、为郊区农业、为人民生活需要服务”的方针，积极开展增产节约运动，力争提前和超额完成今年生产计划。
    会议认为，各城市人民公社应在生产发展的基础上，有计划有步骤地发展和办好集体生活福利事业。大力发展生产，是办好城市人民公社的中心环节。为了使城市人民公社更加巩固和健全地向前发展，必须大力抓发展生产这个中心环节，并在发展生产的基础上逐步改善社员的生活。当前要整顿和巩固集体生活福利事业，建立和健全各项管理制度，不断提高服务质量。要切实办好街道公共食堂，保证群众吃饱、吃好、吃省、吃得干净卫生。对于托儿所、幼儿园、儿童乐园，特别是婴儿室，应当进一步提高工作质量。当前特别要做好过夏天的工作，以保证儿童的夏季生活过得健康愉快。
    会议要求各城市人民公社深入开展文化革命，认真作好教育、文化、卫生、体育工作。目前城市人民公社的文化教育工作的主要任务是巩固扫盲成果，并在此基础上，普及高小，大办群众业余文化教育，迅速提高社员群众的政治、文化、技术、业务水平，以适应社会主义建设大跃进的需要。同时应积极办好“少年之家”把少年儿童的校外生活全面组织起来，实现儿童教育社会化。
    为了保证完成今年的生产计划，使城市人民公社能够在巩固的基础上更加健全地向前发展。会议强调指出，必须进一步加强党对城市人民公社的领导。一方面要在社员群众中广泛深入地开展学习毛主席的著作，开展社会主义、共产主义教育运动，不断扫除资产阶级思想的影响，提高社员的共产主义觉悟，巩固无产阶级思想阵地。另一方面要充实和加强城市人民公社的干部队伍，抓紧干部的培训工作，要求公社的各级领导干部经常深入群众，深入生产第一线，关心群众的生产和生活，与群众同甘共苦，遇事与群众商量，更好地贯彻群众路线，使领导工作更深入、更踏实。
