Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 1st. Guangxi's Yulin Prefecture is taking advantage of the gap before the busy season of early rice harvesting to prepare for late rice fertilization as soon as possible. The entire prefecture has mobilized more than 400,000 laborers for fertilizer accumulation and production, with an average of 45 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu, more than half of which is well-fermented refined fertilizer.

Early action and early preparation are the main reasons for the rapid development of the fertilizer accumulation movement in this prefecture. As early as mid-May, the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to focus on the preparation for late rice production while grasping the late-stage field management of early rice. The county and commune Party committees at all levels have made fertilizer accumulation plans, specifically arranged agricultural work and labor, and adopted a combination of long-term accumulation and short-term assaults, and a combination of fixed personnel and mass mobilization to carry out the fertilizer accumulation and production movement.

In the process of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, all localities have extensively sought out fertilizer sources, making the accumulated and manufactured fertilizer abundant and of high quality. The Yashan Commune in Bobai County organized 28 cadres and commune members to conduct on-site surveys and appraisals of fertilizer sources, and identified ten ways to accumulate fertilizer and more than 2,800 fertilizer sources. The Liantang Brigade of the Liangtian Commune in Luchuan County accumulated stable manure, collected green manure, fermented water manure, collected household manure, made compost, and burned lime fertilizer, accumulating more than 160,000 dan of various fertilizers and producing more than 130,000 dan of good fertilizer in a few days.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, all localities are led by the secretary and cadres take the lead. Li Lin, Secretary of the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Ying, First Secretary of the Luchuan County Party Committee, and Qiu Jian, Secretary of the Liangtian Commune Party Committee, went to the Liantang Brigade and harvested green manure with the commune members, which greatly encouraged the masses and led more than 600 commune members in the entire brigade to quickly launch a high tide of fertilizer accumulation, harvesting more than 600,000 jin of green manure in a few days. Under the leadership of Liu Yuxuan, Secretary of the Guixian County Party Committee, the cadres of the Shilong Commune carried their luggage and camped on the mountain to accumulate fertilizer, with the number of people involved in fertilizer accumulation accounting for 80% of the total labor force. Due to the in-depth leadership of the Party Committee Secretary, the Zhanjiang Commune accelerated the fertilizer accumulation movement of the Yunliu Brigade, making it an advanced fertilizer accumulation brigade in the entire commune.

    广西玉林专区四十万人大积大造肥料
    新华社南宁1日电　广西玉林专区趁早稻收割大忙前空隙，及早为晚稻积肥。全专区投入积肥制肥的劳动力达四十多万人，平均每亩已积肥四十五担，其中沤制好的精肥占一半以上。
    早动手、早准备，是这个专区积肥运动迅速开展的主要原因。早在5月中旬，中共玉林地委就指示各地在抓好早稻后期田间管理的同时，抓好晚稻生产准备。各县委和公社党委层层作出积肥规划，具体安排了农活、劳力，采取长期积制与短期突击，固定专人和全民动手相结合的办法，开展积制肥运动。
    各地在积制肥料中广找肥源，使积制的肥料又多又好。博白县鸦山公社组织二十八个干部、社员实地勘察鉴定肥源，找出了十条积肥门路和两千八百多处肥源。陆川县良田公社莲塘大队积厩肥、采绿肥、沤水肥、收家肥、搞堆肥和烧石灰肥，几天内就积得各种肥料十六万多担，制好肥料十三万多担。
    各地在积肥运动中都由书记挂帅，干部带头。中共玉林地委书记里林、陆川县委第一书记王英、良田公社党委书记丘健等，到莲塘大队和社员一道上山采绿肥，大大鼓舞了群众，带动了全队六百多个社员迅速掀起积肥高潮，几天内采青六十多万斤。贵县石龙公社干部在县委书记刘玉璇的带动下，都背着行李上山扎营积肥，全社投入积肥的人数占总劳力的80％。湛江公社由于党委书记深入带头，使云柳大队积肥运动由慢转快，成为全社积肥先进大队。
