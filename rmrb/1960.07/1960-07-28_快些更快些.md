In many places, the harvesting of early rice and the planting of late rice are called "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush]. The farming proverb "Spring strives for the day, summer strives for the hour" also speaks of the need to rush.

To "抢" [qiǎng, rush/grab] means to emphasize speed. Taking the harvesting of early rice as an example, its most suitable harvesting period is only a few short days. Missing it will cause losses. Moreover, quick harvesting is the prerequisite for quick planting; if the early rice is not harvested, the land cannot be cleared, and it will be impossible to plant the late rice. As for planting late rice, the high summer temperatures and long sunshine hours are most suitable for the growth of late rice. The earlier it is planted, the higher its yield. Furthermore, quick planting and extensive planting are linked together; only with quick planting can we plant more and ensure the completion of the late rice planting area. From any perspective, rushing to harvest and rush to plant are matters that should be done urgently rather than slowly, quickly rather than leisurely.

The broad masses are eagerly demanding speed, and their tireless struggle in the rolling rice fields, regardless of the scorching summer heat, is the best proof. The responsibility of leaders is to further encourage the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses and explain to them that harvesting early rice and planting late rice is an intense battle, a battle that has a decisive significance for whether the entire year's production can be a bumper harvest. In this intense battle, successfully completing this task will yield rich fruits of labor. The approach taken by You County is very good. They earnestly did meticulous ideological work among the masses and also specifically found some concrete facts of quick harvesting and early planting versus slow harvesting and late planting to make a comparison, vividly illustrating the benefits of quick harvesting and early planting over slow harvesting and late planting. People's communes with "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush] tasks should earnestly summarize their experiences in this area and educate the masses to always maintain vigorous energy.

To harvest and plant quickly, there is also a lot of specific work to be done, such as organizing teams, arranging farm work, promoting advanced agricultural tools, and arranging the lives of the masses. Solving these problems well can achieve twice the result with half the effort and greatly speed up the progress of "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush]. Some places also have some specific difficulties, such as relatively tight labor, insufficient harvesting and planting tools, etc., which also require leadership to help solve. Therefore, while grasping ideological education, it is also necessary to solve specific problems in a timely manner, and not be satisfied with the preparations before "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush]. It is necessary to go deep into the fields to see whether the original arrangements are in line with objective reality, what good experiences there are, and what problems there are, and solve them specifically one by one. Doing so will not only greatly boost the morale of the masses, but also strengthen the leadership of the "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush] work in a practical way. The leading cadres of You County went deep into the fields, solved the labor problem when they found problems in the organization of labor, and immediately established professional teams for the use of advanced tools when they found that advanced tools were not being used much. This leadership method and style should be greatly promoted.

Let us muster our energy and complete the "double抢" [shuāng qiǎng, double-grab or double-rush] task faster and better!

    快些更快些

    很多地方把收早稻、插晚稻称为“双抢”。农谚“春争日，夏争时”也是说的要抢。
    要“抢”，就是要讲究快。就收早稻来说，它的最适当的收割期只有那么短短几天，一错过去，就会造成损失；并且，快收又是快插的前提；早稻收不回，腾不出土地，就不可能把晚稻插下去。就插晚稻来讲，夏季气温高，日照长，最适合晚稻生长，越早插下去，它的产量越高；并且，快插和多插又是联系在一起的，只有快插才能多插，保证完成晚稻播种面积。无论从哪方面说，抢收抢种是宜急不宜缓，宜快不宜慢的事情。
    广大群众是迫切要求快的，他们不顾炎天暑日，顽强地奋战在稻浪滚滚的田野里，就是最好的证明。领导者的责任是进一步鼓舞广大群众的劳动热情，向群众说明收早插晚是一场紧张战斗，是一场对全年生产能否丰收具有决定意义的战斗。在这场紧张的战斗中，胜利完成这个任务，就能获得丰硕的劳动果实。攸县采取的作法是很好的。他们认真地向群众做了细致的思想工作，还具体找了一些收得快插得早和收得慢插得迟的具体事实作对比，生动地说明了快收早插比慢收迟插的好处。有“双抢”任务的人民公社，都应认真地总结这方面的经验，教育群众始终保持旺盛的干劲。
    要快收快插，还有许多具体工作要做，例如，组织队伍，安排农活，推广先进农具，安排好群众生活等等。这些问题解决得好，就能收事半功倍之效，大大加快“双抢”进度。有些地方也还有些具体困难，如劳动力比较紧张，收割、栽插工具不足等，也需要领导上帮助解决。因此，在抓紧思想教育的同时，还要及时地解决好具体问题，不能满足于“双抢”前的准备工作，要深入田间，看看原来的安排是否符合客观实际，有哪些好经验，有些什么问题，具体地一个个地解决。这样作不但能大大鼓舞群众的情绪，更能切切实实地加强“双抢”工作的领导。攸县领导干部深入田间，发现劳动力组织上有问题就解决劳动力问题，发现新工具使用不多就立即把使用先进工具专业队建立起来，这种领导方法和作风是应该大大提倡的。
    让我们鼓足干劲，更快更好地完成“双抢”任务！
