　　Arrange Summer Vacation Well
    The summer vacation for schools at all levels across the country has now begun successively. How to enable all teachers and students to have a meaningful summer vacation is a matter of concern to the majority of teachers, students, and parents, and it is also an important task for education leaders at present.
    Under the situation of the continued Great Leap Forward of the people across the country and the in-depth development of the education revolution, many teachers and students are preparing to use this summer vacation to engage in more teaching reform work, study and training work, and production labor and scientific research activities. They are full of enthusiasm and express their intention to spend this summer vacation with a fighting spirit. This kind of positive political enthusiasm and this kind of wish are very good, and these activities are very meaningful and should be properly arranged and carried out. However, in order to implement the spirit of combining work and rest, and in order to better and more persistently carry forward the revolutionary drive and enthusiasm of the majority of teachers and students, education administrative departments must pay attention to ensuring that teachers and students have a meaningful and well-rested summer vacation when arranging summer activities. After a semester of intensive teaching and learning for teachers and students across the country, it is very necessary to have a period of time for teachers and students to have a good rest, recharge their energy, and then welcome the teaching tasks of the new school year. Only by combining work and rest can we continue to leap forward in teaching and continuously improve quality. The purpose of rest is precisely to maintain full energy and better study and work.
    During the summer vacation, education departments, education trade unions, and the Communist Youth League organizations can organize some cultural and sports activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of teachers and students, as well as on-site visits with educational significance. Where conditions permit, they can also hold some short-term and meaningful summer camps and military camping, so that the majority of teachers and students can get positive and pleasant rest in various activities and live a vibrant life. Through various activities, teachers and students can also freely talk, exchange experiences in work and study, exchange experiences in teaching reform, and deeply feel the Great Leap Forward of the motherland in the past year. Teachers and students can voluntarily participate in various activities according to their own circumstances, and make a plan for vacation life to make the summer vacation life rich and colorful.
    For the summer vacation life of young children, education administrative departments at all levels, as well as parents and Young Pioneer counselors, should pay special attention to strengthening guidance. After the realization of communization, the vast majority of women in the family have participated in production labor. Therefore, during the summer vacation, there is an urgent need for all parties to pay attention to strengthening the out-of-school education of young people so that they can participate in beneficial activities and pay attention to their health and safety. When arranging vacation activities for them, it is necessary to take into account the interests of children of different ages, open up more summer activity venues for children, and carry out a variety of meaningful activities. At the same time, urge them to complete the holiday assignments left by the school on time, so that they will not neglect their studies during the holidays.
    However, to make teachers and students have a pleasant and meaningful summer vacation does not mean that you only pay attention to these activities, and there is nothing else that needs to be done or cannot be done. For example, students whose homes are in rural areas can participate in some agricultural labor during their vacation back home, according to the specific local conditions. This not only supports the current agricultural production, but also receives short-term labor training. This is very necessary and very meaningful, and it is precisely the enthusiastic wish of many students returning home. For another example, this summer vacation is the time when the teaching reform of schools at all levels is being carried out in depth, and many teachers are actively preparing to study and improve their political, cultural, and professional level in order to adapt to the urgent need for teaching reform. Under the condition of properly arranging rest time, it is also very necessary for teachers to participate in some short-term training courses held by education departments or schools during the holidays. As for students using their holidays to appropriately review their lessons, prepare for the study of the new school year, and plan to read some extracurricular books, this is something that can be done completely.
    It is hoped that education administrative departments, school leaders, education trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, and parents of students will pay more attention to and properly arrange the summer vacation life of teachers and students with greater care, create better conditions for the summer activities of teachers and students this year, and ensure that teachers and students can both rest well and have a very rich and meaningful summer vacation. Through a pleasant summer vacation life, the majority of teachers and students will be more motivated and will greet the teaching and learning tasks of the new school year with abundant energy!

### 好好安排暑假生活

　　好好安排暑假生活
    今年全国各级学校的暑假，现在已经陆续开始。怎样使全体师生都过个有意义的暑假生活，这是广大师生和学生家长所关心的问题，也是教育领导部门当前的一项重要工作。
    在全国人民继续大跃进，教育革命深入发展的形势下，许多学校的师生都准备利用今年暑假多搞些教学改革工作，学习进修工作，和生产劳动以及科学研究活动。他们满怀热情地表示要以战斗的精神来度过这个暑假，这种积极的政治热情和这种愿望都是很好的，这些活动也是十分有意义的，应该妥善地安排和开展这些活动。但是，为了贯彻劳逸结合的精神，为了更好地更持久地发扬广大师生这种革命干劲和热情，教育行政部门在安排暑期活动的时候，必须注意使师生在暑假里过得既有意义，又休息得好。在全国师生经过一学期紧张的教学和学习生活以后，有一段时间让师生很好地休息一下，养精蓄锐，再迎接新学年的教学任务是十分必要的。只有劳逸结合，才能更好地在教学上持续跃进，不断提高质量。休息的目的，也正是为了保持饱满的精力，更好地学习和工作。
    在暑期中，教育部门、教育工会、共青团组织可以组织一些有益师生身心的文化体育活动和有教育意义的现场参观访问，在有条件的地方，还可以举办一些短期的富有意义的夏令营和军事野营，使广大师生在各种活动中得到积极愉快的休息，生活过得生气勃勃。通过各种活动，还可以使师生自由地畅谈，交流工作、学习的经验，交谈教学改革的心得体会，和对一年来祖国大跃进的深切感受。师生们可以根据自己的情况，自愿参加各种活动，并订个假期生活的计划，使暑假生活过得丰富多彩。
    对于少年儿童的暑假生活，各级教育行政部门，以及家长们和少先队辅导员们，要特别注意加强指导。实现公社化以后，广大家庭妇女都参加了生产劳动，因此，在暑假中迫切要求各方面注意加强对少年的校外教育工作，使他们能够参加有益的活动，并注意他们的健康和安全。在为他们安排假期活动的时候，一定要照顾到不同年龄儿童的兴趣，为孩子们多开辟一些暑期活动的场所，开展多种多样的有意义的活动。同时，督促他们按时完成学校留下的假期作业，使他们在假期中也不要荒疏了学业。
    但是，要使师生度一个愉快的有意义的暑假，并不等于只注意以上这些活动，别的什么事情都不需要做、不可以做了。譬如，家在农村的学生，在假期回乡期间，就可根据当地具体情况，参加一些农业劳动，这样，既支援了当前的农业生产，也可受到短期的劳动锻炼。这是十分必要，十分有意义的，也正是许多回乡学生的热烈愿望。又譬如，今年暑假正值各级学校教学改革深入开展的时候，许多教师都积极准备很好地进修学习一番，提高自己的政治、文化、业务水平，以适应教学改革的迫切需要。在妥善安排好休息时间的情况下，教师们在假期中参加教育部门或学校举办的一些短期进修班，这也是十分必要的。至于学生们利用假期适当地复习一下功课，为新学年的学习作些准备，有计划地阅读一些课外书籍，这更是完全可以作到的事情。
    希望教育行政部门、学校领导、教育工会、共青团组织，以及学生家长们，以更大的关心，重视和妥善安排师生的暑期生活，为今年师生们的暑期活动创造更好的条件，保证教师和学生在暑假中既能休息好，又过得十分丰富，十分有意义。通过愉快的暑假生活，广大师生将更加鼓足干劲，以充沛的精力，迎接新学年的教学和学习任务！
