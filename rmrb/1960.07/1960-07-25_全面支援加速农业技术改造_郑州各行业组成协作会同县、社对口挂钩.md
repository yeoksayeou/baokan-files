Comprehensive Support to Accelerate Agricultural Technological Transformation
Zhengzhou Various Industries Form Cooperation Associations to Pair Up with Counties and Communes

(Our dispatch) Zhengzhou city’s industry, commerce, education, and military in Henan province have adopted the form of "Cooperation Associations" to provide comprehensive and systematic support to agricultural production, effectively promoting agricultural technological transformation.

The "Cooperation Association" was developed on the basis of direct pairing between factories and communes, shops and communes, etc. Before March of this year, many units in Zhengzhou city directly paired with factories and communes, shops and communes, institutes and communes, schools and communes, and achieved great results. However, a single unit is often limited by its type of work, production capacity, etc., and cannot meet the needs of agricultural production. For example, some communes need a large number of irrigation and drainage machines, but the paired factory can only perform general repair work; some communes need various machine tools and other production equipment, while the paired factories and shops can only provide some daily necessities, and so on.

In view of this situation, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to adopt the form of "Cooperation Association" to provide comprehensive support to agricultural production. One hundred and twenty-eight large and medium-sized factories, enterprises, transportation, government organs, military units, schools, health and other departments in the city have formed seven "Cooperation Associations", respectively, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, and are paired with counties and communes, respectively. Each "Cooperation Association" is based on a large unit as the backbone and has various industries such as industry, infrastructure construction, transportation, commerce, culture, education and health. They jointly go to the countryside to investigate the situation, jointly formulate support plans, and jointly take responsibility in the process of implementing the plans.

Since the establishment of the "Cooperation Association", although only three months have passed, it has shown its great superiority. For example, a "Cooperation Association" with Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory as the backbone has sent 380 technical personnel to the countryside in the past three months. They carried tools and spare parts to the fields, well sides, warehouse sides, and machine sides to help communes repair more than 300 irrigation and drainage machines, support 14 sets of various machines and equipment, 11 tons of steel and pig iron, and more than 100 pieces of tooling, gauges and fixtures. They also helped communes build machinery manufacturing and repair plants, fertilizer plants, and pesticide plants by making use of local materials and self-reliance. The units under the Cooperation Association also gave full play to their strengths according to their own characteristics, "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their unique abilities," and provided complete sets of support to rural communes from design, production equipment, installation, technical qualification to management. In June of this year, in order to support rural areas in fighting drought and seizing planting, the Textile Machinery Factory Cooperation Association accepted the task of manufacturing 4,400 sets of irrigation and drainage machine parts. This Cooperation Association completed the task in half a month, based on the specialties of each unit and the spirit of making whatever they could make. The Cooperation Association has also trained a variety of technical talents for rural areas.

The comprehensive, complete, and systematic support of industry to agriculture and cities to rural areas has greatly accelerated the technological transformation of agriculture and further strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas. From the establishment of each "Cooperation Association" to the present, they have produced more than 1,000 diesel engines, 700 water pumps, 360 electric motors, 1,300 harvesters, 3,700 waterwheels, more than 990,000 pieces of various improved agricultural tools, 200 tons of pesticides, and 30,000 tons of chemical fertilizers for rural areas, and supported rural communes with 884 sets of various machines and equipment, 475 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, 12,000 meters of power lines, 500 tons of steel, and more than 130,000 pieces of tooling, gauges and fixtures; helped communes establish 409 new power stations, 340 power stations, 26 fertilizer plants, 5 pesticide plants, and a number of machinery manufacturing and repair plants, etc. In addition, more than 20,000 technical workers (times) were sent to various rural areas to help communes repair 4,600 machines (times), and at the same time, they adopted the methods of "inviting, sending, training, and guiding" to train more than 10,000 various technical personnel for rural areas, thereby rapidly strengthening the technical force in rural areas, improving the technical level, and expanding production capacity.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the work of supporting agriculture, from the Municipal Party Committee to various factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and Party committees, committees, sub-committees and groups for supporting agriculture headed by the First Secretary or Secretary have been established, and special personnel have been assigned to set up offices to regularly conduct in-depth inspections and supervisions, disseminate advanced experiences, and discover and solve problems, which has vigorously promoted the smooth development of the work of supporting agriculture.

### 全面支援加速农业技术改造  郑州各行业组成协作会同县、社对口挂钩

    全面支援加速农业技术改造
    郑州各行业组成协作会同县、社对口挂钩
    本报讯　河南郑州市工商学兵采取“协作会”的形式，全面系统地支援农业生产，有效地促进了农业的技术改造。
    “协作会”是在厂社、店社等对口挂钩的基础上发展起来的。今年3月以前，郑州市许多单位，通过厂社、店社、院社、校社直接对口挂钩，取得了很大成绩。但是，一个单位常常受工种、生产能力等方面的限制，不能满足农业生产的需要。如有的公社需要大量的排灌机械，而挂钩厂仅能进行一般修检工作；有的公社需要各种机床等生产设备，而挂钩厂、店只能提供一些生活资料，等等。
    根据这种情况，中共郑州市委决定采取“协作会”形式，全面支援农业生产。全市一百二十八个大、中型的工厂、企业、交通运输、机关、部队、学校、卫生等部门，已分别组成了七个“协作会”，在市委的统一领导下，分别和县、社对口。每个“协作会”，都是以大单位为骨干，拥有工业、基建、交通运输、商业、文教卫生等各个行业。他们共同下乡调查情况，共同制订支援规划，在执行规划过程中共同负责。
    “协作会”建立以来，虽然只有三个月的时间，但却显示了它的巨大优越性。如以郑州砂轮厂为骨干的一个“协作会”，三个月来，就派往农村各种技术人员三百八十名，他们身带工具和零件，深入田间、井边、库边和机旁，帮助公社检修各种排灌机械三百多台，支援各种机器设备十四部，钢材生铁十一吨，工卡量具百余件，并帮助公社就地取材、自力更生，建设起了机械制造修配厂、化肥厂、农药厂。协作会所属的各单位，还根据本身特点，发挥所长，“八仙过海各显神通”，从设计、生产设备、安装、技术过关到管理，对农村公社进行成套成龙的支援。今年6月为了支援农村抗旱抢种，纺织机械厂协作会，接受了制造四千四百套排灌机械配件的任务。这个协作会，就根据各单位特长，本着会做啥就造啥的精神，半个月内就完成了任务。协作会还为农村培养了多种技术人材。
    工业对农业、城市对农村全面地成套地系统地支援，大大加速了农业的技术改造，进一步密切了工农、城乡之间的关系。各“协作会”从建立到现在，先后共为农村生产柴油机一千多台，水泵七百台，电动机三百六十台，收割机一千三百台，水车三千七百部，各种改良农具九十九万余件，农药二百吨，化肥三万吨，并支援农村公社各种机器设备八百八十四部，排灌机械四百七十五台，动力线一万二千米，钢铁五百吨，工卡量具十三万多件；帮助公社新建立动力站四百零九处，电力站三百四十处，化肥厂二十六座，农药厂五座，和一批机械制造修配厂等。另外，还派出各种技术工人两万余人（次），巡回农村各地，帮助公社修复了各种机械四千六百台（次），同时采取“请、派、训、带”的办法，为农村培养各种技术力量一万余名，从而迅速壮大了农村的技术力量，提高了技术水平，扩大了生产能力。
    为了加强对支援农业工作的领导，从市委到各厂矿、企业、学校、党委，都成立了由第一书记或书记挂帅的支援农业委员会、分会和小组，并抽出专人设立了办公机构，经常深入检查督促，传播先进经验，发现问题解决问题，有力地推动了支援农业工作的顺利开展。
