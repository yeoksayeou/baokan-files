Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Approximately one thousand farmer representatives from twenty-seven prefectures in Japan held a national farmers' conference today.

The conference passed a resolution declaring the new "Security Treaty" invalid and stating that farmers would refuse to bear any obligations brought about by the new "Security Treaty." The resolution also opposed transferring power from Nobusuke Kishi to politicians of the Kishi type.

The conference also passed a resolution demanding that the government raise the purchase price of rice from farmers from 10,333 yen per koku (equivalent to 150 kilograms) last year to 12,700 yen. The resolution stated that this price is the minimum price that can compensate for production costs.

Another resolution passed by the conference opposed the implementation of a "trade liberalization" policy, on the grounds that it would damage Japanese agriculture.

After the meeting, the farmer representatives held a demonstration in Tokyo, led by Katsuji Nozoe, chairman of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation. They held up many flags woven from rice straw, which read: "Let us crush the Security Treaty with the power of worker-farmer solidarity!" "Let us drive those who promoted the Security Treaty out of politics!" "We oppose the Zaibatsu government!" They demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, demanding a meeting with the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.

These one thousand farmer representatives are scheduled to stay in Tokyo for four days to negotiate with the Liberal Democratic Party and relevant government departments on the issue of raising rice purchase prices.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Japanese workers, standing at the forefront of the anti-American, anti-Kishi patriotic struggle, continue to hold rallies and demonstrations to protest the Nobusuke Kishi's traitorous government's illegal suppression of workers who participated in the struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

On the morning of the 5th, more than two thousand workers held a rally in front of the Nagoya branch of the state-owned railway company, opposing the authorities' punishment of railway workers who had gone on strike. Participants in the rally included railway workers from the prefecture and other workers from various trade unions. The conference passed a resolution opposing the illegal suppression of workers and demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" and the dissolution of the Diet. The workers also held a demonstration in downtown Nagoya.

A delegation of seventy representatives elected by the conference submitted protests to the state-owned railway company, the telecommunications and telephone company, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

The headquarters of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union issued a statement today strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's mass punishment of workers by the Ministry of Posts. The statement said that the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, together with the people, rose up to prevent the ratification of the "Security Treaty" in order to defend the peace and democracy of Japan. The authorities' unreasonable punishment of workers who participated in this struggle is hateful and infuriating.

The statement also pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal punishment of workers is a vain attempt to impose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on the Japanese people in order to use Japan as a fortress for the United States to carry out aggressive wars.

The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union decided to hold half-hour workplace rallies at twelve thousand workplaces across the country on July 7 to protest the authorities' illegal punishment of workers.

According to reports, Nobusuke Kishi's traitorous government's Minister of Posts openly announced today that disciplinary action would be taken against 12,408 participants who opposed the new "Security Treaty," including the suspension of 187 people.

In addition, the state-owned railway company authorities also unreasonably announced this afternoon the punishment of union members who participated in the unified actions to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" on June 4, June 15, June 22, etc., including suspension, salary reduction, and "serious warning."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japan Teachers' Union held a national congress in Tokyo on the 5th and 6th, and adopted future movement guidelines.

The guidelines pointed out that the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" should be transformed into a movement to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The guidelines emphasized that teachers should oppose the government's suppression of participants in the anti-U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" movement and the conspiracy to organize a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet.

The movement guidelines said that if the government takes punitive action against railway workers, the teachers' union will hold protest rallies.

According to the movement guidelines, teachers participating in the teachers' union will expand their activities against the new "Security Treaty" to small cities and rural areas in July and August to collect signatures for the "Peace and Democracy Declaration."

The teachers' union decided to make August this year the "Month for Striving for Peace." During this month, teachers will make efforts to ensure the success of the planned World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Mothers' Congress. The movement guidelines suggested that teachers strengthen their work in their residential areas during the "Month for Striving for Peace" so that workers and their families can hold rallies for peace in all residential areas.

The movement guidelines also called on all teachers to strengthen the struggle against the "Performance Evaluation" system. The movement guidelines especially emphasized carrying out daily struggles at the workplace in order to strengthen trade union organizations. (Attached photo)

    大会还通过决议，要求政府把对农民的大米收购价格从去年的每日石（合一百五十公斤）一万零三百三十三日元提高到一万二千七百日元。决议说，这个价格，是能够补偿生产成本的最低限度的价格。
    大会通过的另外一个决议反对实行“贸易自由化”政策，理由是：这将破坏日本的农业。
    会后，农民代表们在东京市内举行了示威游行，全日本农民协会联合会会长野沟胜率领着游行队伍。他们高举着许多用稻草编织成的旗帜，上面写道：“让我们以工人和农民团结一致的力量来粉碎安全条约！”“让我们把促使通过安全条约的人们驱逐出政界！”“我们反对财阀政府！”他们在农林省前举行了示威，要求会见农林相。
    这一千名农民代表预定在东京停留四天，以便同自由民主党和有关政府部门谈判提高大米收购价格问题。
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：站在反美反岸爱国斗争前列的日本工人，继续举行集会和示威，抗议岸信介卖国政府非法镇压曾经参加反对新日美“安全条约”斗争的工人。

    日本全递信从业员工会总部今天发表声明，对岸信介政府邮政省大批处罚工人的行为提出强烈的抗议。声明说，全递信从业员工会同国民一道起来进行阻止批准“安全条约”的斗争，是为了保卫日本的和平和民主。当局无理处罚参加这一斗争的工人，令人憎恨和愤怒。
    声明同时指出，岸信介政府非法处罚工人，是妄图把日美军事同盟条约强加于日本人民头上，以便把日本作为美国的进行侵略战争的堡垒。
    全递信从业员工会决定7月7日在全国一万二千处工作场所举行半小时的工作场所大会，抗议当局非法处罚工人的行为。

    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本教职员工会5日和6日在东京举行全国代表大会，通过了今后的运动方针。
    方针指出，反对修改“安全条约”的运动应该转为废除日美军事同盟条约的运动。
    方针强调教师们要反对政府镇压反对日美“安全条约”运动的参加者和组织岸信介式内阁的阴谋。
    运动方针说，如果政府对铁路工人采取惩罚行动，教职员工会将举行抗议大会。
    根据运动方针，参加教职员工会的教师将在7、8两月把他们反对新“安全条约”的活动扩大到小城市和农村地区去，为“和平民主宣言”征集签名。
    教职员工会决定把今年8月作为“争取和平月”，在这个月中，教师们将作出努力，使计划中的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会和母亲大会获得成功。运动方针建议教师们在“争取和平月”中在自己居住的地区内加强工作，使工人及其家属在所有的居住地区内举行争取和平的集会。
    运动方针同时要求所有的教师加强反对“勤务评定”制度的斗争。运动方针特别强调在工作地点进行日常的斗争，以便加强工会组织。（附图片）
