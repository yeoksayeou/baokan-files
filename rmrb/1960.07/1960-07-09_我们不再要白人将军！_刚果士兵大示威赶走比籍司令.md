Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, Leopoldville: Soldiers in the newly independent Congo are protesting the continued presence of Belgian colonialists as officers at all levels of the Congolese army. On the morning of July 6th, a group of Congolese soldiers stationed at the Leopold Camp near Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, marched out of the barracks and demonstrated in front of the parliament building. They chanted slogans such as "Down with Janssens" (former Belgian commander of the colonial army in the Congo, who still commanded the Congolese army after independence), "We don't want white generals anymore," and "We want a Congolese general."

It is reported that the soldiers were unarmed. However, when Janssens, the Belgian commander-in-chief of the security forces, drove through the city, the angry demonstrators stopped his car and beat him with belts. Two American magazine reporters who were there were also beaten by the demonstrators, including a "Life" magazine photographer who was keen to promote American aggression policies, and his camera was smashed.

On the same day, in Thysville, more than 100 kilometers from Leopoldville, Congolese garrison soldiers also ran out of their barracks, demanding the replacement of all Belgian officers. Sources say that at the Hardy Camp in Thysville, 2,500 Congolese soldiers surrounded 50 Belgian officers and sergeants and their families. There are also reports of incidents against Belgian police officers in the Congolese police force. It is said that in the police barracks in Luvingula, five Belgian police officers have been imprisoned by their subordinates. It is reported that under strong opposition from Congolese soldiers, Belgian General Janssens, whose hands were stained with the blood of Congolese patriots, has been forced to offer his "resignation."

However, according to a Belgian Ministry of Defense spokesman in Brussels, troops at Belgian military bases in the Congo are on alert. It is reported that the situation is still developing.

The Belgian colonialists' so-called "security force" in the Congo has more than 20,000 people, mostly Congolese, who can only serve as soldiers and are ruled by about 1,000 Belgian officers. This force was not reorganized after the Congo became independent.

    “我们不再要白人将军！”
    刚果士兵大示威赶走比籍司令
    新华社8日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：新近独立的刚果的士兵反对比利时殖民主义者继续留在刚果军队中担任各级军官。6日上午，驻在刚果首都利奥波德维尔附近利奥波德营地的一部分刚果士兵走出兵营，开到议会大厦门前举行了示威。他们高呼“打倒让桑”（前比利时在刚果的殖民军司令、刚果独立后他仍统率着刚果军队）、“我们不再要白人将军”、“我们要一名刚果将军”等口号。
    据报道，这些士兵没有携带武器。但是，当比利时籍治安部队总司令让桑乘车驶过城市时，愤怒的示威士兵拦住了他的汽车，并且用皮带打了他几下。到那里进行活动的两名美国杂志的记者也遭到示威士兵的殴打，其中有一个是热中于宣传美国侵略政策的“生活”杂志的摄影记者，他的照相机也被砸毁了。
    同一天，在距利奥波德维尔一百多公里的太斯维尔，刚果驻军的士兵也跑出了兵营，要求撤换所有比籍军官。有消息说，在太斯维尔的哈迪营地，二千五百名刚果士兵曾包围那里的五十名比籍军官和军士以及他们的家属。还有消息说，在刚果警察部队中，也发生了反对比籍警官的事件。据说，在卢芬古拉的警察营房，有五名比利时警官已被他们的部下关入监狱。据报道，在刚果士兵的强烈反对下，两手沾满了刚果爱国者鲜血的比利时将军让桑已被迫提出了“辞职”。
    但是，据比利时国防部发言人在布鲁塞尔透露，在刚果的比利时军事基地的军队已经处于戒备状态。据报道，目前事态尚在发展中。
    比利时殖民主义者在刚果的所谓“治安队”有二万多人，绝大部分是刚果人，他们只能当士兵，受到约一千名比籍军官的统治。在刚果独立后，这支部队没有改组。
