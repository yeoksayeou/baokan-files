Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th. Since the beginning of the spring production campaign, 220,000 cadres in Hunan Province have been deeply involved in the forefront of agricultural production. With the spirit of "fighting until the rice grains turn yellow, and managing until the grain enters the granary," they are conscientiously summarizing and creating experience, and working with the broad masses to launch a field management campaign for early and mid-season rice, centered on topdressing, to win an agricultural bumper harvest. At present, after winning the victories of shortening the greening period and the tillering stage of early and mid-season rice, all localities adhere to the method of concentrating leadership, cadres, and labor. The province has organized more than 4 million laborers to continue to eliminate the three types of seedlings and vigorously attack the stages of strong stalks, round feet, and heading of early rice. The province's more than 23 million mu of early rice and more than 11 million mu of mid-season rice are now characterized by thick stalks, large tufts, tall seedlings, and green leaves, with thriving rice seedlings in every field.

The successful experience of cadres going deep into the front line of production and vigorously developing command fields, experimental fields, high-yield fields, and seed fields has played a huge leading and promoting role in the field management campaign for early and mid-season rice. At the beginning of field management, in order to speed up topdressing and cultivation and eliminate the three types of seedlings, Liu Quande, the first secretary of the Wu Gang County Party Committee, used his experimental field in the operational team as a command field. All 8,700 cadres in the county also combined with commune members and experienced farmers to develop more than 210,000 mu of high-yield experimental fields, adding measures and efforts, reducing the three types of seedlings in the county's rice fields by half, and increasing the proportion of first-class seedlings to 93%. The Shao Yang area moved offices from the prefectural committee to the grassroots and the fields. In 90% of the 25,000 production teams in the region, there was a state cadre leading and participating in field management. In the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests in the Chen Zhou area, 130,000 cadres at all levels, according to the requirements of pest control, turned the original "four fields" (command field, experimental field, high-yield field, and seed field) into reconnaissance fields, prevention and control command fields, and experimental fields for testing the standards of indigenous pesticides.

The leadership method of combining general appeals with specific leadership and combining breakthroughs at one point with comprehensive promotion has begun to be mastered by leaders at all levels who have gone deep into the forefront of production. After a slow progress in field management, Li Xueliang, the first secretary of the Ningxiang County Party Committee, immediately went to the Lianmeng Brigade of the Xiaduo Pu Commune to conduct investigation and analysis. He found that the main contradiction was the dispersion of leadership and labor, especially in summer planting and summer management, with more semi-laborers and fewer main laborers, and the efficiency and quality were generally not high. The main reason was that cadres and the masses were not clear about continuing to implement the "taking grain as the key link" policy, and mistakenly believed that once early and mid-season rice were planted, there was no need to concentrate labor on agricultural production. Through setting out farm work, calculating seasons, and calculating labor, cadres and the masses were re-educated to adhere to "taking grain as the key link." The county also immediately took measures to concentrate 80% of the cadres, 80% of the rural labor force, and more than 80% of the young and middle-aged people to strengthen the main battle line of summer planting and summer field management, and to win an agricultural bumper harvest, bringing a new situation to agricultural production in the county.

While leading cadres at all levels continued to go deep to the end, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee also organized seven agricultural production inspection teams to go to various places to inspect. Under the slogan of "Go all out, advance victoriously, fight until the rice grains turn yellow, and manage until the grain enters the granary," cadres and the masses in various places are continuing to launch a field management campaign centered on topdressing.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. Leading cadres at all levels in Gansu Province went deep into the front line of production, leading the masses to fight drought and protect autumn crops, and carrying out rush weeding, watering, and topdressing for autumn fields. By June 20, more than 16.99 million mu of grain fields in the province had been weeded once, more than 3.24 million mu had been topdressed once, and more than 4.18 million mu had been irrigated once. The Dingxi area, which has made faster progress, has weeded more than 90% of its cotton fields for the first time.

In April and May of this year, there was little rainfall in Gansu Province, and drought occurred in some areas. In early June, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee organized a meeting of cadres at six levels in the province to converge in the fields, go deep into the field, and conduct a major inspection and comparison of field management of summer and autumn fields, autumn planting, and drought resistance. Immediately, a magnificent summer production upsurge was set off throughout the province. In the autumn field management, various localities launched a tenacious struggle against drought. Longnan area actively built dikes and dams to intercept and store floodwater; Longdong plateau erected aqueducts to transfer northern water to the south; farmers on the banks of the Da Xia River, based on the experience of "autumn fields are harvested on hoes, hoeing more times yields more grain," weeded to create moisture and protect autumn. The people's communes in the Hexi Corridor are repairing canals and building reservoirs, digging wells and dredging springs, installing machinery, and lifting water to irrigate fields. Anxi County's people's communes comprehensively inspected and repaired field canals, and county, commune, and team cadres followed labor, and water conservancy cadres went down to the teams to divide the leadership of irrigation teams to rush to irrigate seedling water. Various localities have also adopted the method of shortening the battle line, concentrating forces, and strengthening key points to rush to build a number of key reservoirs to increase drought resistance capabilities and expand the irrigation area of ​​summer and autumn fields.

In order to give full play to the effectiveness of newly built water conservancy projects, all localities have paid special attention to the installation and matching of water lifting machinery. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 1,193 sets of water lifting machinery have been installed and used in the province, with 44,430 horsepower, which can irrigate 750,000 mu of land. Industrial, financial, and trade departments in various places have also vigorously supported agriculture, transferring many irrigation and drainage machinery, cultivating farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides to the countryside. Some areas have also drawn technicians and veteran workers to form service teams to go deep into various people's communes to help install water pumps, gasoline engines, generators, water pumps, various waterwheels, and artificial rainmakers.

During the busy summer harvest and planting season, Chengchuan People's Commune in Huicheng County, Gansu Province, rationally arranged labor and formed three teams for harvesting, planting, and managing, achieving simultaneous harvesting, planting, and managing, tightly interlocked.

    深入总结推广经验　大搞指挥田试验田
    湖南大批干部领导群众猛攻早稻孕穗关
    甘肃各级干部下乡大抓秋田除草追肥工作
    本报长沙30日电　湖南省从春季生产运动一开始，就深入农业生产第一线的二十二万名干部，正以
  “战到谷粒黄，管到谷进仓”的劲头，认真总结和创造经验，和广大群众一道展开了以追肥为中心的早、中稻田间管理运动，夺取农业丰收。目前，各地在已攻下了早、中稻的缩短回青期关、分蘖关的胜利基础上，坚持领导、干部、劳力三集中的办法，全省组织四百多万劳动力，继续消灭三类苗，猛攻早稻壮秆、圆脚、孕穗关。全省二千三百万多亩早稻、一千一百多万亩中稻，现在都秆粗蔸大、苗高叶青，丘丘禾苗欣欣向荣。
    干部深入生产第一线，大搞指挥田、试验田、丰产田、种子田的成功经验，在早、中稻田间管理运动中，又发挥了巨大的带头和推动作用。中共武冈县委在田间管理开始，为了加快追肥中耕、消灭三类苗，县委第一书记刘全德把自己深入作业组搞的试验田作为指挥田，全县八千七百多名干部也都分别与社员、老农结合起来搞了二十一万多亩丰产试验田，加措施、加干劲，使全县稻田三类苗减少了一半，一类苗上升到93％。邵阳专区从地委到生产大队，都把办公室搬到了基层和田间，全区二万五千个生产队中，90％的队都有一个国家干部在领导和参加田间管理。郴州专区各级干部十三万人在防治病虫害中，根据治虫的要求，把原来的“四田”（指挥田、试验田、丰产田、种子田）变成防治病虫灾害的侦察田、防治指挥田和试验田，测验土农药的标准田。
    一般号召与具体领导相结合、突破一点与全面推广相结合的领导方法，已开始为深入生产第一线的各级领导干部所掌握。中共宁乡县委第一书记李学良，在田间管理出现进度缓慢现象以后，立即深入夏铎铺公社联盟大队进行调查解剖，发现存在的主要矛盾是领导精力与劳力分散，特别是在夏种、夏管上半劳力多，主要劳力少，工效和质量普遍不高。主要原因是干部和群众对继续贯彻“以粮为纲”认识不明确，误认为早、中稻下田了，再不需要集中劳力搞农业生产了。通过摆农活、算季节、算劳力，向干部和群众进行了坚持“以粮为纲”的再教育，全县也立即采取措施，集中80％的干部、80％的农村劳力、80％以上的青壮年，加强夏种、夏季田间管理的主攻战线，夺取农业丰收，使全县农业生产出现了一个新的局面。
    在各级领导干部继续深入到底的同时，中共湖南省委还组织了七个农业生产检查组，深入各地检查，各地干部和群众在“鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，战到谷粒黄，管到粮进仓”的口号下，正继续深入地展开以追肥为中心的田间管理运动。
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省各级领导干部深入生产第一线，领导群众抗旱保秋，给秋田作物突击锄草、浇水、追肥。到6月20日，全省已有一千六百九十九万多亩粮田锄过一次草，有三百二十四万多亩追过一次肥，有四百一十八万多亩灌过一次水。进展较快的定西专区，90％以上的棉田都已锄过头遍。
    今年4、5月间，甘肃省降雨稀少，部分地区发生旱情。6月上旬，中共甘肃省委组织全省六级干部会师田间，深入现场，对夏秋田的田间管理、秋田播种和抗旱斗争进行了大检查大评比，随即在全省掀起了波澜壮阔的夏季生产高潮。各地在秋田管理中，与干旱展开了顽强的斗争。陇南地区积极打堤筑坝，拦洪蓄水；陇东高原架设渡槽，让北水南调；大夏河畔的农民根据“秋田收在锄头上，多锄几遍多打粮”的经验，锄草造墒，保秋护秋。河西走廊各人民公社正在修渠筑库，打井掏泉，安装机械，提水灌田。安西县各人民公社全面检查和整修田间渠道，县、社、队干部跟班劳动，水利干部下队分工领导灌溉专业队突击浇灌苗水。各地还采取缩短战线，集中力量，加强重点的办法，突击建成一批重点水库，以增加抗旱能力，扩大夏秋田灌溉面积。
    为了发挥新建水利工程的实效，各地特别抓紧了提水机械的安装配套工作。据初步统计，全省已安装使用的提水机械共有一千一百九十三台，四万四千四百三十马力，能灌地七十五万亩。各地工业、财贸部门也都大力支援农业，调出许多排灌机械、中耕农具、化肥和农药等送往农村。有些地区还抽出技术员和老工人组成服务队，深入各人民公社，帮助安装水泵、汽油机、发电机、抽水机、各种水车和人工降雨器。（附图片）
    在繁忙的夏收夏种时节，甘肃省徽成县成川人民公社合理安排劳力，组成收、种、管三支队伍，做到了边收、边种、边管，环环扣紧。这是由女社员们组成的田间管理专业队在玉米地里追肥。
