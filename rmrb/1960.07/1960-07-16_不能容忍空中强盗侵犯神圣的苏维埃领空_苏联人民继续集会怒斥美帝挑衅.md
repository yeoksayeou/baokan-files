Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: The Soviet people in various regions continue to hold rallies and make speeches, angrily condemning the crime of U.S. spy planes invading Soviet airspace once again.

Thousands of workers at the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow held a protest rally on the 13th. Mold worker Kudrov said at the meeting that the only way to answer the shameless provocations of the imperialists is this: We have struck down the destroyers of peace in the past, and we will continue to strike them down in the future. We will eliminate any invading enemy. He said: "The captured spies will be severely punished, but even more severe punishment awaits those who send spies to our country."

　　All Soviet People Will Step Forward to Defend the Motherland
　　Aggressors Cannot Intimidate the Soviet People
At a rally of workers at the Dorogomilovo Chemical Factory in Moscow, instrument worker Andrianov said: Aggressor gentlemen, you are playing with fire! Don't expect your provocations to go unpunished. The Soviet army has struck down air pirates in the past, and will strike them now and in the future. If necessary, all of our people will step forward to defend our beloved motherland.

At a mass rally at the "Electric Motor" factory in Mogilev, Belarus, fitter Petrov said that U.S. warmongers are continuing to engage in new and dangerous adventures. He said that everyone now understands what U.S. President Eisenhower meant when he said that he had ordered the cessation of U.S. Air Force spy flights in Soviet airspace. But the aggressors cannot intimidate the Soviet people. We have struck down the enemy more than once, and if necessary, we will give them a devastating blow that will prevent them from ever recovering.

　　Soviet People Will Strengthen the Power of the Motherland
　　Resolutely Repulse U.S. War-Mongers
At a worker rally held at the Stalinabad Textile Joint Factory, production team leader Kurbanov said that we do not threaten anyone. However, if the aggressors dare to test our strength, then they will suffer complete destruction. The participants said in a unanimously adopted resolution: We severely condemn the U.S. aggressors, and we will use hard work to continue to strengthen the strength of the motherland and the cause of defending world peace.

In Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, factories and enterprises have also held protest rallies in recent days. At a worker rally at the Alma-Ata Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, engineer Murzagaliyev said that the U.S. aggressors have carried out blatant provocations. But as the people of the East say: "No matter how much the dogs bark, the camel train will still move forward." The warmongers cannot stop us from advancing towards the victory of communism. Kelemaev, the head of the Communist Youth League group in the workshop, said that the Soviet people have the means to defend the borders of the motherland and fight back against U.S. war provocateurs, and our people will do everything possible to strengthen the power of the motherland.

　　Wherever U.S. Aerial Bandits Appear
　　We Will Shoot Them Down From There
The officers and soldiers of the Pacific Fleet also immediately held rallies after hearing the news that U.S. planes had once again invaded the Soviet Union. At a meeting of submarine soldiers, soldier Shebakov said that the U.S. spy planes destroying Soviet airspace is a link in the U.S. aggressive policy. In the current situation, our submarine soldiers should maintain a high degree of vigilance.

At a rally held on the 13th in a unit of the Volga Military District, officer Nachayev said that if U.S. air pirates think it is easier to enter the Soviet Union from the north, they are wrong. No matter where they appear, we can shoot them down.

　　If the U.S. Imperialists' Hands Are Itchy, There is Medicine to Cure Them
Captain Khalikov said at the meeting that if the U.S. imperialists' hands are itchy, we have medicine to cure them. We believe that those who send spy planes to invade the Soviet Union will one day sit in the dock like Powers, McCone and Olmsted.

Babich, chairman of the Leningrad Northern Cable Factory Committee, said in an article published in "Labor News" on the 14th that our people love peace, but this does not mean that we will tolerate the shameless provocations of U.S. militarists. More than 40 years of history of the Soviet state have shown that when our enemies start using force, our people will unite their strength more closely. In order to fight back against the shameless provocations of the robbers on the other side of the ocean, every Soviet person will become more vigilant. The hot-headed guys in the Pentagon should remember our proverb: "He who sows the wind, shall reap the whirlwind!"

Burmistrov, the stationmaster of the Murmansk Railway Station, said in "The Whistle" that the whole world now knows how shamelessly Eisenhower and Herter and his ilk lie. These politicians hypocritically declared that they had ordered the cessation of spy plane flights over the Soviet Union, but these words cannot be believed.

Mass protest rallies were also held in Rustavi, Irkutsk, Baku, Chimkent and other places.

　　不能容忍空中强盗侵犯神圣的苏维埃领空
　　苏联人民继续集会怒斥美帝挑衅
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联各地人民继续举行集会和发表谈话，愤怒谴责美国间谍飞机再次侵犯苏联的罪行。
    莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂的数千名职工13日举行抗议集会。制模工人库德罗夫在会上说，对帝国主义者的无耻挑衅，只能这样回答：我们过去打击了和平的破坏者，今后仍将打击他们。我们将消灭任何来犯的敌人。他说：“被擒的间谍将受到严厉的惩罚，但是，更加严厉的惩罚在等待着那些往我国派遣间谍的人。”
    全苏人民将挺身捍卫祖国
    侵略者吓不倒苏联人民
    在莫斯科多罗戈米洛夫化学工厂的工人集会上，仪器工安德里亚诺夫说：侵略者先生们，你们是在玩火！不要指望自己的挑衅行为不会受到惩罚。苏联军队过去打击过、现在和将来都要打击空中强盗，如果需要的话，我们全体人民都要挺身捍卫亲爱的祖国。
    在白俄罗斯莫吉略夫市的“电动机”工厂的群众集会上，钳工彼得罗夫说，美国黩武主义者在继续进行新的危险的冒险。他说，现在大家都清楚，美国总统艾森豪威尔所说的他已下令停止美国空军在苏联领空进行间谍飞行的话意味着什么。但是，侵略者是吓不倒苏联人的。我们不止一次地打击了敌人，如果需要的话，我们将给他们以歼灭性的回击，使他们永远恢复不过原气来。
    苏联人民将加强祖国威力
    坚决回击美国战争挑拨者
    在斯大林纳巴德纺织联合工厂举行的职工集会上，生产队长库尔巴诺夫说，我们不威胁任何人。但是，如果侵略者胆敢试探我国的力量，那么他们就将遭到彻底的毁灭。与会者在一致通过的决议中说：我们严厉谴责美国侵略者，我们将用紧张的劳动来继续加强祖国的实力和保卫世界和平的事业。
    哈萨克首都阿拉木图的工厂企业连日来也都举行了抗议集会。在阿拉木图重型机械制造厂的职工集会上，工程师穆尔扎加利耶夫说，美国侵略者进行了明目张胆的挑衅。但正像东方人民所说的：“不管狗怎样狂吠，骆驼队还是照样前进”。战争挑拨者们是阻挡不了我们向共产主义胜利前进的。车间共青团小组长克列麦耶夫说，苏联人民是有办法保卫祖国的疆界和回击美国战争挑拨者的，我国人民将尽一切努力来加强祖国的威力。
    美国空中强盗在那里出现
      就把他们从那里打下来
    太平洋舰队的官兵们在听到美国飞机再次侵犯苏联的消息后，也都立即举行集会。在一次潜水艇战士们的集会上，战士谢巴科夫说，美国间谍飞机破坏苏联领空是美国侵略政策的一个环节，在目前形势下，我们潜水艇战士应该保持高度的警惕性。
    在伏尔加军区某部13日举行的一次集会上，军官纳恰耶夫说，如果美国空中强盗以为从北方进入苏联比较容易，那他们就错了。无论他们在那里出现，我们都能把他们打下来。
        如果美帝的手发痒　是有药治它的
    上尉哈利科夫在会上说，如果美帝国主义者的手发痒，我们是有药可治的。我们相信，派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联的人将有这么一天会同鲍尔士、麦寇恩和奥姆斯特德一样坐在被告席上。
    列宁格勒北方电缆工厂委员会主席巴比奇14日在“劳动报”上发表谈话说，我国人民是爱好和平的，但这决不是说我们会容忍美国黩武主义者的无耻挑衅。苏维埃国家四十多年的历史表明，当我们的敌人开始动武的时候，我国人民就更加紧密地团结自己的力量。为了回击大洋彼岸强盗们的无耻挑衅，每个苏联人都将更加提高警惕。五角大楼头脑发热的家伙们应该记住我们的谚语：“谁种祸根，谁遭殃！”
    摩尔曼斯克铁路火车站长布尔米斯特罗夫在“汽笛报”上说，现在全世界都已知道艾森豪威尔和赫脱之流是多么无耻的撒谎者。这些政客假惺惺地声明已下令停止间谍飞机在苏联上空飞行，但这些话是不能相信的。
    在鲁斯塔威、伊尔库次克、巴库、奇姆肯特等地也都举行了群众性的抗议集会。
