    People's Lives Are Getting Better and Better, Market Scene Is Becoming More Prosperous
    ——Survey of Purchasing Power of Residents of the Third Lane Committee of Mengzi Road, Luwan District, Shanghai

    This year, the market situation in Shanghai is very good. The huge increase in residents' purchasing power is one of the main reasons for the market boom. Where exactly is this huge purchasing power reflected? In order to answer this question, we selected an ordinary working people's residential area—the Third Lane Committee of Mengzi Road, Luwan District (hereinafter referred to as "Meng San") for investigation.
    The "Meng San" Lane Committee area has 1,851 households and 8,147 people. Before liberation, this place was full of thatched huts and earthen houses, a "slum" where working people gathered. At that time, more than 80% of the residents had no fixed jobs, and most of them made a living by pedaling tricycles, carrying night soil, working as coolies, and picking up garbage. Their lives were "eating swill from the slop bucket, filling their stomachs with vegetable peels and bean dregs, wearing ragged clothes and tatters, and living in broken thatched sheds." Their demands for life were reduced to lingering on, barely maintaining their lives. They dared not have the slightest extravagant hope for food, clothing, and use.
    In the eleven years since liberation, the lives of people here have undergone earth-shaking changes. In the early days of liberation, there were more than 500 unemployed or semi-unemployed laborers here. Since then, the number of people employed has increased year by year. By 1958, unemployment had been completely eliminated, and they all became workers with fixed wage income. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the lane established fourteen production teams, and 960 housewives participated in labor, accounting for more than 85% of the entire district's female labor force.
    After housewives participated in collective production, residents' income increased significantly. At the end of 1958, the total monthly income of all "Meng San" residents was approximately 125,152 yuan. By the beginning of March 1960, it had risen to 156,714 yuan. In one year, the monthly income of more than 1,000 households increased by more than 30,000 yuan, an increase of more than 20% compared to a dozen months ago. What an exciting figure this is! With the increase in residents' income, people's consumption levels have risen sharply. Calculated as an average per capita monthly living expense for the entire district, it is as follows:
    1957: 9 to 11 yuan
    1958: 13 to 15 yuan
    1959: 15 to 17 yuan
    First half of 1960: 19.24 yuan
    This figure is calculated as an average for people of all ages. There is also an undeniable factor, which is that the number of children in this area has increased by 2,856 in the past eleven years, accounting for more than 30% of the total population.
    Eating, Clothing, and Using Are Getting Better and Better
    What kind of changes have these exciting numbers brought about in people's consumption?
    Let's look at the "eating" aspect. Not only can no one find starving people here, and rice and white flour have become common staple foods, but people's demands for food are constantly increasing. The "Meng San" First Canteen was the earliest canteen established here. Two years ago, when the canteen was first opened, very few people ate there. Dishes costing three to five cents a bowl were very popular, and not many people bought dishes costing more than one dime. This year is very different. Of the 600 servings of side dishes sold daily, those costing more than one dime account for half and are always sold out first. Once, the central canteen cooked dozens of servings of steamed shad, costing 4 dimes a bowl, and they were sold out in minutes.
    Most of the children here used to be poorly clothed, but in recent years, the changes in people's clothing can also be seen from the children's clothes. We investigated a middle class in the "Meng San" Second Nursery. Among the 36 children in the class, there are 69 wool sweaters and vests, 9 pairs of wool pants, about 20呢子的、灯芯绒的、绒线的儿童大衣 [Note: unclear what the best translation is here, but types of children's coats]. They have a total of 50 pairs of rubber shoes, leather shoes, and galoshes. Nineteen little girls have about 30 beautiful one-piece dresses and suspender skirts.
    We also did a small survey of 46 households with 189 residents in the First Residential Group of "Meng San" 926 Lane. This year, they bought 16 new cotton quilts, 25 woolen clothes, 54 thermos bottles, 192 undershirts and vests, 15 stainless steel pots, 122 pairs of sneakers, 62 pairs of galoshes, 32 large towels, as well as watches, electric clocks, and radios.
    We can also see the changes in people's consumption levels from the table of household expenditure ratios in three different periods:
    Category | Staple Food | Non-staple Food | Clothing | Culture & Hygiene | Oil & Salt | Rent | Fuel | Savings | Other
    ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
    Before Liberation (percentage of total expenditure) | 80% (mainly coarse grains and miscellaneous grains) | 5% | 2% | 0 | 3% | 5% | 5% | 0 | 0
    Before 1958 (percentage of total expenditure) | 32% (rice, flour) | 24% | 10% | 8% | 3% | 5% (plus water and electricity) | 5% | 3% | 10%
    Since the Great Leap Forward (percentage of total expenditure) | 24% (rice, flour) | 22% | 25% | 8% | 0 (Note) | 5% (plus water and electricity) | 0 (Note) | 8% | 8%
    Note: After the Great Leap Forward, people participated in canteens, and oil, salt, and fuel expenses were no longer included in the accounts.
    This statistical table and the series of facts mentioned above clearly point out that before liberation, the working people struggled on the verge of starvation. In order to feed themselves, they spent almost all their income, and still ate coarse grains and miscellaneous grains, not even getting a full meal three times a day. After liberation, people's income has been continuously increasing. While the absolute quantities of food, clothing, and use have grown together, the proportional relationship between the three has gradually changed. The proportion of food has relatively decreased, and the proportion of clothing and use has gradually increased. On the basis of eating well and eating well, people will inevitably demand to dress better and use more. People's living needs are becoming more and more complex. From here, we can happily see the increasingly beautiful picture of people's lives.
    Changes in Several Ordinary Families
    Let's take a look at the changes in the economic lives of a few ordinary families!
    The family of Xue Guiying at No. 24, Lane 252, Mengzi Road, is one of the families here that got employed relatively late, and the family income is still relatively low among the families in this area. But the change in their purchasing power is very large. Xue Guiying was married in early 1949. At that time, none of the four members of the family, including her parents-in-law and husband and wife, had fixed jobs. They borrowed five dou of rice at high interest rates to do small business, and lost all the money in a few days. The family of four couldn't even get enough mixed grains, and used picked-up vegetable peels as food. In July 1955, her husband became a worker at Shunfeng Enamel Factory, with a monthly salary of 45 yuan. Xue Guiying helped people wash clothes, earning about 4 yuan in income; her parents-in-law passed away, but three children were added to the family. The income of more than 49 yuan was distributed as follows: 120 jin of rice for 15.3 yuan; 9 yuan for vegetables, 1.5 dan of coal briquettes for 4.2 yuan, 1.47 yuan for oil and salt, 1.5 yuan for water and electricity, 4 yuan for children's expenses, 5 yuan for household expenses, 4 yuan for savings, and 5 yuan for debt repayment. After the Great Leap Forward, Xue Guiying participated in the lane production team, with a monthly salary income of 23 yuan, and the family's monthly income was 68 yuan. Not only did they pay off the debt, but they also had some savings every month. In the past two years, they have accumulated a lot of money. Since the beginning of this year, her husband bought a new woolen trousers and a pair of leather shoes for 22.4 yuan. She made a satin-lined cotton-padded jacket for 32 yuan. The children each bought a pair of sneakers, and the whole family also bought ten pairs of socks and five zhang and five chi of cloth.

    Xu Tongying, a nursery worker at the "Meng San" Nursery, also excitedly talked about the changes in her family. Her husband is a tricycle worker. When they got married before liberation, they had a quilt and four door panels, and the whole family only had six pieces of clothing. Now her husband still pedals a tricycle, with a monthly income of more than 70 yuan; after she joined the lane nursery, she also has an income of 26 yuan, and the family has an income of about 100 yuan a month. Each month, savings alone are more than 30 yuan. In the past six months, they have bought two pairs of gabardine trousers, a woolen coat, a radio, a canvas bed, a silk quilt cover, two pairs of leather shoes, and a silk cotton-padded jacket. Xu Tongying said, "Things like these, in the past, a tricycle family would not dare to dream of them."

    Growth of Group Purchasing Power
    After the vast number of lane residents were organized, the collective production of "Meng San" has greatly increased. In 1958, the monthly output value of the lane production team was only 720 yuan. In the first half of this year, it has developed to 41,270 yuan per month. The great development of lane production has brought about the vigorous development of collective welfare undertakings; the great development of collective undertakings has formed a new huge purchasing power. Now, "Meng San" has three central canteens, two nurseries, two breastfeeding rooms, and a kindergarten, 24 service teams, one private primary school, one spare-time middle school, and one library each, as well as an elderly club, a children's center, and a health station, a broadcasting station, and so on. Although most of these organizations were established by making do with whatever was available and starting from scratch, they must also purchase some necessary equipment and welfare supplies from the market. In the first half of the year, they spent a total of more than 110,000 yuan in these areas. For example, the lane canteen added more than 120 tables and benches, purchased 978 enamel basins and more than 3,200 large and small rice bowls, and the central canteen also bought refrigerators, exhaust fans, electric fans, etc.; the lane nursery organization also added 544 small tables and benches and hundreds of spittoons, enamel bowls, cups, and stainless steel pots. In addition, the broadcasting station added equipment such as amplifiers and broadcasting machines, and the elderly club also added equipment such as sofas and radios… It's really countless.

    Market Prosperity, Savings Rising
    Near the "Meng San" area, there were only a dozen small shops a year or two ago, most of which were one or two-bay stores. Since the end of last year, in order to adapt to the increase in residents' purchasing power, the original five stores have been expanded, and a four-bay department store and a five-bay shoe and hat clothing store have been newly opened. In addition, there are also restaurants, Zhang Xiaoquan knife and scissors stores, and a five-bay vegetable market sales department. How is the business of these stores? We investigated a Jinjin Department Store.

    The customers of Jinjin Department Store are mostly residents in the Liyuan Road and Mengzi Road areas. We first found a comparison table of store sales in the same period over the past four years:

    Period | Retail Sales (yuan) | Compared to the second quarter of 1957
    ------- | -------- | --------
    Second quarter of 1957 | 24,747 | 100%
    Second quarter of 1958 | 56,681 | 229.1%
    Second quarter of 1959 | 63,360 | 256%
    Second quarter of 1960 | 88,041 | 355.7%

    Since the end of last year, this store has opened a four-bay branch in the "Meng San" area. Before the arrival of this summer, the store originally only planned to stock up on more undershirts and vests with 42-count yarn or less. Other high-end undershirts were only stocked as general goods. Who knew that after the peak season for undershirts arrived, many customers came to buy high-end undershirts, so they had to quickly add more goods. In June, among the 1,600 men's undershirts sold by the Jinjin branch, the high-end undershirts with 60-count, 80-count, and 100-count yarn were 528 pieces, almost accounting for one-third of the total number of men's undershirts; high-end soaps and other products have also become best-selling products. Facing such strong purchasing power, even the负责人 [Responsible person] of the department store who has worked in this area for many years said that he "underestimated" it.

    Finally, we came to the Xiqiao Savings Office of the People's Bank. According to the statistics of this savings office on 611 households in the "Meng San" area who are organized to participate in collective production, in the whole year of 1959, only 50 households had current savings, with a total amount of 320 yuan, and prize savings were only 340 yuan. But this year, the situation has changed greatly, and savings deposits have been rising linearly every month. See the table below:

    1960 | Current Savings (yuan) | Prize Savings (yuan)
    ------- | -------- | --------
    January | 700 | 440
    February | 800 | 620
    March | 1,200 | 980
    April | 1,250 | 1,280
    May | 1,200 | 1,329
    June | 1,700 | 1,489

    From the changes in the lives of residents in this lane, with the continuous increase in residents' income, purchasing power has greatly increased. This huge purchasing power is dispersed in thousands of households. It seems like bits and pieces, but "a trickle of water becomes a sea." When gathered together, it will cause a huge reaction in the market. An inevitable trend is that with the continuous leap forward in production, people's purchasing power will increase more and more, the market will become more and more prosperous, and our lives will become more and more beautiful!

### 人民生活越过越好　市场景象日益繁荣——上海卢湾区蒙自路第三里弄委员会居民购买力调查

    人民生活越过越好　市场景象日益繁荣
    ——上海卢湾区蒙自路第三里弄委员会居民购买力调查
    谢刚　向明生　汤根鑫　赵乾发
    今年，上海市场形势很好。居民购买力的巨大上升，正是形成市场繁荣的主要原因之一。这一股巨大的购买力究竟表现在那里呢？为了回答这个问题，我们选择了一个普通的劳动人民居住区——卢湾区蒙自路第三里弄委员会地区（以下简称“蒙三”）进行了调查。
    “蒙三”里弄委员会所属地区，有一千八百五十一户、八千一百四十七人。解放前，这里到处是草棚土屋，是一个劳动人民聚居的“贫民窟”。当时，80％以上的居民没有固定职业，大多数靠踏三轮车、挑大粪、当苦力、拾垃圾混日子。他们的生活是“吃的泔脚盆里饭，菜皮豆粞填肚皮，破衣破絮身上穿，破草棚里把身安。”他们对生活的要求也降低到了苟延残喘，仅能维持生命的地步，对吃、穿、用三者已经不敢存有丝毫奢望。
    解放十一年，这里人们的生活在经历着一场翻天复地的变化。解放初期，这里失业或半失业的劳动力就有五百余人，以后，劳动就业的人数年年增加，到1958年全部消灭了失业现象，他们都成了有固定工资收入的职工。1958年大跃进以后，里弄办起了十四个生产组，九百六十位家庭妇女参加了劳动，占整个地区妇女劳动力的85％以上。
    家庭妇女参加集体生产后，居民收入显著增加。1958年年底，全“蒙三”居民每月总收入约十二万五千一百五十二元，1960年3月初，就上升到十五万六千七百十四元。一年之间，一千多户人家，每月增加三万多元收入，比十几个月前上升了20％以上，这是个多么激动人心的数字啊！居民收入的增加，人们消费水平直线上升。按整个地区人口平均计算，每人每月平均生活费用如下：
    1957年　九至十一元
    1958年　十三至十五元
    1959年　十五至十七元
    1960年上半年　十九点二四元
    这个数字，是按大小人口平均计算的。这里还包含着一个不可忽视的因素，就是这个地区十一年来儿童人数增加了二千八百五十六人，占总人数30％以上。
    吃穿用越来越好
    这一连串激动人心的数目字，究竟在人们消费中起了什么样的变化呢？
    且看“吃”的方面。这里不但早已找不到挨饿的人了，大米白面成了共同的主食品，而且人们对吃的要求不断提高。“蒙三”第一食堂，是这里兴办得最早的食堂，两年前，刚办食堂时，搭伙的人很少，三五分钱一盆的菜很畅销，一角钱以上的菜，买的人不多。今年可大不同了。一天六百客小菜中，一角钱以上的占一半，总是先卖完。有一次中心食堂烧了几十客清蒸鲥鱼，四角钱一盆，几分钟就卖光了。
    这里的孩子，以前多半是衣不蔽体的，可是近年来，从孩子的穿着上，也可以看出人们在穿的方面起着什么样的变化。我们调查了“蒙三”第二托儿所的一个中班。班上的三十六个小朋友中，有六十九件绒线衫和马夹，九条绒线裤，二十来件呢子的、灯芯绒的、绒线的儿童大衣，他们共有五十双胶鞋、皮鞋和套鞋，十九位小妹妹有三十来件漂亮的连衫裙和背带裙。
    我们又在“蒙三”九百二十六弄第一居民小组四十六户、一百八十九位居民中做了个小统计。今年来，他们新买了十六条棉被，二十五件毛料衣服，五十四只热水瓶，一百九十二件汗衫背心，十五只钢精锅，一百二十二双球鞋，六十二双套鞋，三十二条大毛巾，还有手表、电钟和收音机。
    人们消费水平的变化，我们还可以从一般居民在三个不同时期家庭开支比例表中看出来：
    类别  主食品  副食品  衣着用品  文化卫生  油盐  房租  燃料
  储蓄  其他
  解放前占总支出百分比  80％（粗杂粮六谷粉为主）5％  2％  0  3％  5％  5％  0  0
  1958年以前占总支出百分比  32％（米、面）24％10％8％3％  5％（加水电）5％3％10％
  大跃进以来占总支出百分比  24％（米、面）22％25％8％  0（注）
  5％（加水电）0注8％8％
    注：大跃进以后，人们参加了食堂，油盐、燃料支出都不在账内了。
    这一张统计表格和上面谈的一系列事实，鲜明地指出：解放前，劳动人民在饥饿线上挣扎，为了糊嘴，几乎付出了全部收入，还是吃的粗粮六谷粉，三餐不得一饱。而解放后这些年来，人民收入不断增加，在吃、穿、用三者的绝对数量共同增长的同时，又逐步地改变着三者的比例关系。吃的部分比重相对降低，穿用部分比重逐步上升。人们在吃饱、吃好的基础上，必然要求穿得更好、用得更多了。人们的生活需要是越来越复杂了。从这里，我们可喜地看到了人们生活日益美好的图景。
    几个普通家庭的变化
    让我们再来看看几家普通人家经济生活的变化吧！
    蒙自路二百五十二弄二十四号薛桂英的家庭是这里就业比较晚的一家，家庭收入在这个地区的家庭中，还是比较低的。但是他们的购买力的变化却很大。薛桂英是1949年初结婚的。那时，公婆、夫妇一家四口都没有固定职业，用借高利贷得来的五斗米钱做小生意，几天就赔光了。一家四口连六谷粉都混不上，用拾来的菜皮当饭吃。1955年7月，爱人成了顺风搪瓷厂工人，每月工资四十五元，薛桂英帮人家洗衣服，也有四元左右收入；家里公婆去世了，却加了三个孩子。四十九元多的收入是这样分配的：米一百二十斤十五元三角；菜金九元，煤球一担半四元二角，油盐一元四角七分，水电费一元五角，孩子用费四元，家庭零用五元，储蓄四元，还债五元。大跃进以后，薛桂英参加了里弄生产组，每月工资收入二十三元，一家每月收入六十八元。不但还清了债，月月都有一些积蓄，两年中已经积了不少钱。今年以来，她爱人买了条新呢裤和一双二十二元四角的皮鞋，自己用三十二元做了件缎子衬绒袄，小孩每人买了一双球鞋，全家还买了十双袜子，五丈五尺布。
    “蒙三”托儿所的保育员徐同英，也兴奋地谈起了她家的变化。她爱人是三轮车工人，解放前结婚时是一条被胎，四块门板，全家也只有六件衣服。现在她爱人还是踏三轮车，每个月有七十多元收入；她参加里弄托儿所后，也有二十六元收入，全家一月有一百元左右的收入。每月，光储蓄就有三十多元。这半年多来，他们买了两条哔叽裤、一件呢大衣、一架无线电、一只帆布床、一条绸被面、两双皮鞋、一件丝棉袄。徐同英说：“像这些东西，在早先，踏三轮车的家庭，做梦也不敢想的。”
    集团购买力增长
    广大里弄居民组织起来以后，“蒙三”的集体生产有了大幅度的增长。1958年里弄生产组每月产值只有七百二十元，今年上半年已发展到每月四万一千二百七十元。里弄生产大发展，带来了集体福利事业的蓬勃发展；集体事业的大发展，又形成了一股新生的巨大购买力。现在，“蒙三”有了三个中心食堂，两个托儿所、两个哺乳室和一个幼儿园，二十四个服务组，民办小学、业余中学、图书馆各一所，还有一所老人俱乐部，一个少年之家，以及保健站、广播站等等。虽然这些组织多半是因陋就简、白手起家办起来的，但是也必然要向市场购添一些必要的设备和生活福利用品。上半年，他们在这些方面，总共支出了十一万多元。如里弄食堂就添置了台子、凳子一百二十多件，购置了九百七十八只搪瓷盆和三千二百多只大小饭碗，中心食堂还买了冰箱、排气机、电风扇等；里弄托儿组织也新添了小台、凳五百四十四件和数以百计的痰盂、搪瓷碗、杯和钢精锅等。此外，广播站增添了扩音机、播音机等设备，老人俱乐部里也增置了沙发、无线电等设备……真是不胜枚举。
    市场繁荣　储蓄上升
    “蒙三”地区左近，一两年前，还只有十来家小商店，大多是一两开间门面的，从去年年底以来，为了适应居民购买力的提高，原来的五家商店扩建了，又新开设了四开间的日用百货商店，五开间的鞋帽服装店，此外还有饮食店、张小泉刀剪店以及一个五开间的菜场门市部等。这些商店的业务究竟怎样呢？我们调查了一家金金百货店。
    金金百货店的顾客，大都是丽园路、蒙自路一带的居民，我们先找到了四年来商店同时期的营业比较表：
    时期  商品零售额（元）  与1957年第二季度比较
    1957年二季度    24，747     100％
    1958年二季度    56，681     229.1％
    1959年二季度    63，360     256％
    1960年二季度    88，041     355.7％
    这家商店，从去年年底，又在“蒙三”地区开了一家四开间的分店。今年夏季到来以前，商店原先只准备多备些四十二支纱以下的汗衫和背心，其他高档汗衫只做为一般备货。谁知汗衫旺季到来以后，来买高档货汗衫的顾客很多，只好连忙添货。6月份，金金分店卖掉的一千六百件男式汗衫中，六十支、八十支、一百支纱的高档汗衫就有五百二十八件，几乎占男式汗衫总数的三分之一；高档香皂等也都成了畅销品。面对如此旺盛的购买力，连在这一带工作了多年的百货商店负责人，也连称“估计不足”。
    最后，我们来到了人民银行斜桥储蓄所。根据这个储蓄所对“蒙三”地区六百十一户组织起来参加集体生产的人家统计，1959年全年，只有五十户有活期储蓄，总额三百二十元，有奖储蓄也只有三百四十元。可是今年就形势大变了，储蓄存款月月直线上升，且看下表：
    1960年　活期储蓄（元）　有奖储蓄（元）
    一月　700　440
    二月　800　620
    三月　1，200 　980
    四月　1，250　1，280
    五月　1，200　1，329
    六月　1，700　1，489
    从这条里弄居民生活变化的情况看来，随着居民收入不断增多，购买力有了巨大的上升。这支巨大的购买力，分散在千百个家庭里，看来点点滴滴，但是“涓滴之水，汇成大海”，汇集起来，就会在市场上引起巨大的反响。一个必然的趋势是，随着生产的持续跃进，人民的购买力将越来越增长，市场将越来越繁荣，我们的生活也越来越美好！
