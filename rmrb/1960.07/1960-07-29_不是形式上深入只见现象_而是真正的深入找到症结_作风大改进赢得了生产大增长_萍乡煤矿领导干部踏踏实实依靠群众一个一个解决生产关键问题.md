This newspaper, Nanchang, July 28th: The average daily output of raw coal at the Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province in mid-June and late June increased by nearly 30% compared with early June. (In addition, the mine mobilized cadres and employees' families to sift out a batch of coal from the gangue piles, which was not included in the calculation). This is the result of leaders at all levels going deep into the mine and practically solving problems.

The Pingxiang Coal Mine completed the state's first quarter coal production plan ahead of schedule this year. However, since entering the second quarter, it has encountered many specific problems in the continued Great Leap Forward. These problems were not quickly and thoroughly resolved, which affected production in April and May. The reason for this was mainly that the work style of some cadres was not practical enough. They also went to the front line, but were satisfied with "walking around, standing around, looking around, and talking around." Therefore, they only knew the phenomena but did not understand the reasons for the problems in production; they could only treat the symptoms but not the root cause; and their organizational actions were relatively slow.

In response to this situation, the mine's Party committee, under the guidance of Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, criticized the superficial "going deep" but actually floating work style of some cadres. On this basis, the leading organizations from the mine bureau to the districts moved to work in the mine, and leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production, mobilizing the masses to launch a continuous high-yield movement centered on accelerating mining and tunneling progress, solving some old problems that had been considered difficult to solve in the past, and rapidly increasing production.

After leading cadres at all levels of the Pingxiang Coal Mine went deep into the front line of production, they first grasped the key problems in production, sorted them out one by one, thoroughly investigated them, and found the root causes one by one. As a result of the sorting, the current main problems of the entire mine bureau are three: First, mechanical and electrical equipment often breaks down; second, transportation cannot keep up with production needs, and ground-level crushed coal blockage affects coal output from the mine; third, the preparation of working faces lags behind the mining progress. Around these problems, leading cadres at all levels went deep into the mine, participated in operations personally, and analyzed the reasons with the workers to jointly study solutions. For example, the Wangjiayuan Mine's edge-sweeping groove area has more than 20 electric chutes, which have a total of 20 to 30 major and minor failures every month, hindering production. This time, the district Party branch secretary went deep into the mine to work with the team and held on-site meetings of mechanical and electrical personnel to study the reasons. As a result, it was found that in addition to the problems with some of the electric chutes themselves, the main reason was that the electric chute drivers lacked a strong sense of responsibility, and there were no fixed drivers, so no one inspected and maintained them, and small problems often turned into big problems. In terms of transportation and working face preparation, the key to the problems was also found through in-depth investigation and research by leading cadres at all levels. For example, the main problem in transportation was that the allocation of vehicles could not closely cooperate with production, and the loading and unloading methods were not reasonable. The main problem in working face preparation was that some cadres attached importance to mining and neglected tunneling, resulting in an artificial shortage of working faces.

After grasping the root causes of the problems, leading cadres at all levels further consulted with the masses and adopted a combination of symptomatic and fundamental treatments to solve the problems in a targeted manner. For the problem of mechanical and electrical failures, first of all, the political and ideological education of mechanical and electrical personnel was strengthened to strengthen their sense of responsibility; at the same time, driver personnel were fixed, a responsibility system was established, and on this basis, a red flag competition for safe operation of mechanical and electrical equipment was carried out in conjunction with the high-yield campaign. This greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility and initiative of the driver personnel. Many drivers brought shovels and maintenance tools to work, checked frequently, prevented early, and eradicated accident seedlings; when a fault was found, they immediately rushed to repair it, so that "major problems will not be left overnight, and minor problems will not be left out of shift." After the Wangjiayuan Mine's edge-sweeping groove area adopted this method, it changed from having the most mechanical and electrical accidents to becoming the red flag for safe operation of electric chutes in the entire mine.

In order to thoroughly solve the transportation problem, the entire mine bureau carried out a transportation assault and improved transportation methods according to production needs. In June, the bureau mobilized more than 3,000 cadres and employees' families to rush to clean up and transport the coal slag accumulated on the ground, freeing up a large area of coal storage area and increasing the amount of coal output from the mine. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels and transportation workers jointly researched and developed a reasonable transportation method, that is, long-distance transportation should be fast and run more frequently, and short-distance transportation should be less frequent and more cyclical, which accelerated the turnover of coal cars and ensured production needs.

Leading cadres at all levels also focused on the preparation of working faces. On the one hand, they criticized the one-sided view of some cadres who attached importance to mining and neglected tunneling, and on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to make great efforts in technical innovation and to vigorously promote the vehicle-based transportation of rocks and slag underground. Human power transportation of 10 meters or more underground was basically replaced by flat cars and small winches. As a result, the progress and quality of tunneling work have been greatly improved, thereby adapting to the needs of mining.

In order to ensure that problems are discovered and solved in a timely manner in the future, leading cadres at all levels of the Pingxiang Coal Mine also mobilized the masses to formulate a series of systems, such as the establishment of responsibility area and experimental field systems for leading cadres at all levels; on the basis of working with the team, a system of reporting and meeting after work was established; and a system of three exchanges upon entering the shift (exchanging information, exchanging tasks, exchanging measures) and three checks upon leaving the shift (checking the completion of the plan, checking safety quality, checking cooperation) was implemented among the workers. In this way, from leading cadres to the masses of workers, each level was tightened, so that many problems were caught as soon as they showed signs and were immediately solved.

### 不是形式上深入只见现象　而是真正的深入找到症结  作风大改进赢得了生产大增长  萍乡煤矿领导干部踏踏实实依靠群众一个一个解决生产关键问题

    不是形式上深入只见现象　而是真正的深入找到症结
    作风大改进赢得了生产大增长
    萍乡煤矿领导干部踏踏实实依靠群众一个一个解决生产关键问题
    本报南昌28日电　江西省萍乡煤矿6月中旬和下旬原煤平均日产量比6月上旬增长了将近30％。（另外该矿还发动干部和职工家属从矸子堆中筛出了一批煤，没有计算在内）。这是各级领导干部深入井下，踏踏实实解决问题的结果。
    萍乡煤矿今年第一季度提前完成了国家首季产煤计划，但进入第二季度以来，在继续大跃进中碰到了许多具体问题，未能迅速彻底解决，影响了4、5月份的生产。究其原因，主要是部分干部工作作风不够踏实。他们也到第一线去，但满足于“走一走，站一站，看一看，说一说”，因而对生产中的问题只知现象不明原因；解决问题只能治标不能治本；组织行动也比较迟缓。
    针对这一情况，矿党委在中共江西省委书记白栋材的指导下，批判了某些干部在形式上深入而实际上飘浮的作风。在此基础上，从矿局到区的各级领导机构都搬到了井下办公，各级领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，发动群众展开了以加快采、掘进度为中心的连续性高产运动，解决了一些过去一直认为难以解决的老问题，迅速提高了生产。
    萍乡煤矿各级领导干部深入生产第一线以后，首先抓住生产中的关键问题，逐个排队，追根究底，一一找出根源。排队的结果，全矿局当前的主要问题有三：一是机电设备经常出故障；二是运输跟不上生产需要，地面碎煤堵塞影响井下出煤；三是工作面的准备工作落后于回采进度。各级领导干部围绕这些问题，分头深入井下，亲自参加操作，和工人共同分析原因，研究解决办法。如王家源矿扫边槽区有二十多部电溜子，每月总要出二三十次大小故障，妨碍生产。这次区党支部书记深入井下跟班劳动，又召开机电人员现场会议研究原因，结果发现除部分电溜子本身有问题外，主要是电溜子司机责任心不强，加上没有固定司机，没人检修维护，小问题往往拖成大问题。在运输、工作面的准备等问题上，也通过各级领导干部深入调查研究，找到了问题的关键。如运输方面主要是车辆调拨不能紧密配合生产，装运方法也不合理。工作面的准备工作主要是某些干部重视回采轻视掘进，造成了人为的工作面紧张。
    抓到了问题的根源以后，各级领导干部便进一步同群众商量，采取治标与治本相结合的办法，对症下药，解决问题。对机电故障问题，首先加强了对机电人员的政治思想教育工作，加强他们的责任心；同时固定了司机人员，建立了责任制度，并在此基础上结合高产战役开展了机电安全运转红旗评比竞赛。这样就大大加强了司机人员的责任心和主动性，许多司机上班自带洋铲和检修工具，勤检查，早预防，根绝事故苗；发现故障立即抢修，做到了“大问题不过夜，小问题不过班”。王家源矿扫边槽区采取这种办法后，由机电事故最多变成了全矿电溜子安全运转红旗。
    为了彻底解决运输问题，全矿局按照生产需要，开展了运输突击和改进运输方法。6月份全局动员了三千多名干部和职工家属，突击清理和抢运地面积压的煤渣，空出了大片堆煤区，提高了井下出煤量。同时，各级领导干部与运输工人共同研究出了一种合理的运输方法，即长线路多拉快跑，短线路少拉多循环，加快了煤车周转，保证了生产需要。
    各级领导干部同时狠抓工作面的准备工作。一面批判了某些干部重回采轻掘进的片面观点，一面发动群众大闹技术革新，大搞井下挑拖石头和渣子的车子化，在井下十米以外的人力挑拖基本上都被小平车、小绞车运输所代替。结果，掘进工作进度和质量都大大提高，从而适应了回采的需要。
    为了保证今后及时发现问题、解决问题，萍乡煤矿各级领导干部还发动群众制订了一系列的制度，如各级领导干部建立了责任区、试验田的制度；在跟班劳动的基础上，建立了下班回报、碰头的制度；在工人中实行了进班三交（交情况、交任务、交措施），出班三查（查计划完成情况、查安全质量、查协作配合）的制度，这样，从领导干部一直到工人群众，层层把紧，使许多问题一露苗头就被抓住，并且立即加以解决。
