    The Budding Flower of Qian Opera in the Great Leap Forward
    Zhang Shizhu, Deputy Director of the Guizhou Provincial Bureau of Culture

    Qian Opera is a local opera genre newly developed and grown under the meticulous cultivation of the Party. The predecessor of Qian Opera was Guizhou Wenqin (or Dan Ci), a form of storytelling sung while seated, popular in Guizhou folk culture. Wenqin has a broad mass base in Guizhou, popular not only in Han areas but also in some minority areas. After liberation, as the people advanced by leaps and bounds politically and in production, they demanded more perfect art forms to reflect the new life. Some areas (such as Qianxi County) attempted to move Wenqin from seated singing to the stage, developing it into opera. The Party discovered this meaningful attempt and enthusiastically supported this new thing. Subsequently, some counties and cities formed amateur Wenqin opera troupes to experiment with developing Wenqin opera. In 1958, the call of the Great Leap Forward sounded, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, under the leadership of the Party, threw themselves into the ranks of the Leap Forward with a brand-new attitude and soaring enthusiasm. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the province's literary and art workers to make a special leap forward, demanding that we develop Wenqin opera into a relatively perfect local opera genre with a unique style, quickly, well, and economically, in the direction indicated by the General Line, so that the art cause could better serve politics, production, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In a short period of two years, under the leadership of the Provincial Committee, two Wenqin opera festivals were held, and many special districts and counties established professional Wenqin opera troupes or Qian opera troupes (at present, there are more than 20 professional Qian opera troupes and dozens of amateur troupes in the province). In order to develop Qian opera more quickly, according to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, at the beginning of 1960, this opera genre was officially named Qian Opera. After the festival, some forces from eight professional Qian opera troupes were drawn to form the Guizhou Provincial Qian Opera Performance Troupe for concentrated processing and training. A group of directors and teachers were also drawn from various opera genres in the province, such as Peking Opera, Sichuan Opera, Ping Opera, Yue Opera, and modern drama, to guide Qian Opera. A group of creative personnel was also drawn from other fraternal units in the literary and art circles to engage in the creation and adaptation of scripts and stage art. In this way, under the direct care and cultivation of the Party, under the urgent demands of the people of the whole province, and with the strong support of the entire art circle, Qian Opera quickly developed into a local opera with a unique style in a very short period of time, adding a budding flower and a newborn seedling to the garden of national culture and art. If Qian Opera is a product of the Great Leap Forward, it is completely worthy of the name.

    In the past two years, our initial experience in developing Qian Opera, as mentioned earlier, is that the leadership of the Party has promoted the rapid development of the Qian Opera cause. Facts have proved that the policy determined by the Provincial Committee to develop Wenqin opera into a Guizhou local opera is very correct. This shows that the leadership of the Party is good at discovering new things, supporting new things, and actively cultivating new forces to grow and develop. In developing Qian Opera, the Provincial Committee not only grasped it tightly but also specifically, and the work goals we put forward were all positive and leap forward. Although the Provincial Committee was very busy grasping the central work and grasping industrial and agricultural production, it still took some time to specifically grasp the literary and art work. From the creation of scripts and stage performances to stage art design and the use of costumes and props, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee personally reviewed and instructed. For example, the four major plays we brought to Beijing this time, "Qin Niangmei," "Zhang Xiu Mei," "Female Miner Platoon," and "Red Flag Canteen," have all been reviewed and discussed many times by the responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee. According to their opinions, processing and revisions were carried out. Because the Party Committee pointed out the correct direction and gave us specific guidance, and because it grasped tightly, accurately, and in a timely manner, the Qian Opera cause was able to advance rapidly along the correct path.

    Second, the foundation of literary and art work in Guizhou is relatively weak, and there are not many art cadres. In this case, how can we ensure the rapid leap forward of the Qian Opera cause? One important thing is collective creation, that is, thoroughly taking the mass line in art. The four major plays currently being staged, from the creation and adaptation of the scripts to the rehearsal of the stage and the stage art design (including costumes, scenery, etc.), until the public performance, were all completed in the four months from February to May this year. The reason why we were able to complete such a large amount of work in such a short period of time is because we adopted the method of collective creation and taking the mass line. For example, in screenwriting, first discuss in the writing group and clarify the theme ideology, collectively discuss the outline, then write separately by scene, and then designate someone to modify and connect. After the first draft of each script is completed, it goes through many collective discussions, widely absorbs opinions from various parties, and continues to be processed and revised. After the script is basically completed, it is revised while being rehearsed. For example, directing also adopts the method of collective directing. The directing team first discusses and clarifies the directing intentions of each scene and the handling of the main characters and scenes, and then directs separately by scene, and then unifies the style and modifies the stage handling techniques through joint rehearsals, through rehearsals, and rehearsals with costumes. During the entire rehearsal period, we adopted a combination of screenwriters, directors, bands, actors, and stage art staff, all in order to express the theme ideology in the script, and strive to create a perfect stage art image from various different angles.

    Third, Qian Opera is a new thing, and it is also a seedling that the people of Guizhou eagerly hope will grow and develop rapidly. For its development, the Guizhou art circles, such as Peking Opera, Sichuan Opera, Ping Opera, Yue Opera, Modern Drama, Flower Lantern, and song and dance troupes, all played the spirit of communist collaboration and dispatched necessary backbones to guide Qian Opera; or made demonstration performances, compared together, and improved together. Because of this, Qian Opera has the conditions for high-speed development.

    Fourth, since Qian Opera is a new opera genre, it has not yet created a complete set of procedures in all aspects. From the writing of the script to the stage performance, music and singing, scenery and costume design, to makeup and lighting, how to master both the characteristics of opera and the excellent components of folk art of various ethnic groups in Guizhou in real life, absorb them into Qian Opera art, and make Qian Opera a new type of local opera that can better serve the cause of socialism and communism; how to make Qian Opera absorb parts suitable for itself from major opera genres, integrate them into its own things, and retain a strong local color, create its own unique style, and truly become a unique art form for the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou, we have not yet explored a set of mature experiences in these important aspects. Since Qian Opera actors are all young people who have just started their art careers, and the creative, directing, music, and stage art staff are all intellectuals and veteran artists transferred from all aspects, how to make Qian Opera advance along the correct path is not without struggle. These issues are not only issues of artistic treatment but also issues of how to correctly implement Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. Some comrades often consciously or unconsciously produce various tendencies of impatience or conservatism. In order to truly implement Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art in the development of Qian Opera and to act in accordance with the direction instructed by the Party Committee, the troupe frequently carries out the struggle between two roads and timely corrects various incorrect and unhealthy tendencies in politics and art. This is an important part of the troupe's political and ideological work.

    Although Qian Opera has rapidly developed into a local opera with a unique style in a short period of two years, it is still very young after all, and it is extremely imperfect and immature compared with other fraternal opera genres. In order to make this seedling grow faster and more robustly and to make this budding flower bloom more brightly, it is also necessary for the leadership of the Party at all levels and the art circles across the country to cultivate it more. We hope that it can contribute its strength to the cause of communism in the great Mao Zedong era, in the garden of socialist literature and art of the motherland where a hundred flowers bloom and a riot of color.

    大跃进中初绽的花朵——黔剧
    贵州省文化局副局长　张世珠
    黔剧是在党的细心培植下新发展成长起来的一个地方剧种。黔剧的前身是流行在贵州民间的一种坐唱曲艺——贵州文琴（或称弹词）。文琴在贵州具有广泛的群众性，不仅在汉族地区流行，在某些少数民族地区也有。解放后，人民随着政治上和生产上的大踏步前进，要求用更加完美的艺术形式来反映新的生活，有些地区（如黔西县）便试图把文琴从坐唱搬上舞台，发展成为戏曲。党发现了这种有意义的尝试，热情地支持了这个新生事物。接着，就有一些县市组成业余文琴剧团，试验发展文琴戏。1958年，大跃进的号角响起了，广大的工人、农民、知识分子，都在党的领导下以崭新的姿态、冲天的干劲，投入跃进的行列。中共贵州省委号召全省的文艺工作者来一个特大的跃进，要求我们沿着总路线所指引的方向，多快好省地把文琴戏发展成为一个比较完美的、具有独特风格的地方剧种，使艺术事业更好地为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务。短短两年的时间里，在省委的领导下，举行了两次文琴戏会演，许多专区和县建立了专业文琴剧团或黔剧团（目前全省已有二十多个专业黔剧团和数十个业余剧团）。为了更快地发展黔剧，根据省委的指示，在1960年初将这一剧种正式定名为黔剧，并在会演之后，抽调了八个专业黔剧团的部分力量，组成了贵州省黔剧演出团集中加工训练，还从省内京、川、评、越、话剧等各个剧种抽调了一批导演和教师辅导黔剧，又从文学艺术界其他兄弟单位抽调一批创作人员，从事剧本的创作、改编和舞台美术工作。就是这样，在党的直接关怀与培育下，在全省人民的迫切要求下，在整个艺术界的大力支援下，黔剧才在很短的时间里，迅速地发展成为一种初具独特风格的地方戏曲，使全国文化艺术的百花园中，增添了一枝初绽的花朵和初生的幼苗。如果说黔剧是大跃进的产物，那是完全名副其实的。
    两年来，我们在发展黔剧方面的初步体会，正如前面所说，决定的一条，是党的领导促进了黔剧事业的迅速发展。事实证明，省委所确定的将文琴戏发展为贵州地方戏曲这条方针是非常正确的，这表现了党的领导善于发现新事物，支持新事物，积极培育新生力量发展壮大。在发展黔剧方面，省委不仅抓得紧，而且抓得具体，对我们提出的工作目标都是积极的、跃进的。省委虽然抓中心工作、抓工农业生产非常忙碌，但还是抽出一定时间，具体抓文艺工作。从剧本的创作、舞台表演，到舞台美术设计、服装道具的使用等，省委负责同志都亲自过目、指示。如我们这次带到北京来的《秦娘美》、《张秀眉》、《女矿工排》、《红旗食堂》四个大戏，都经过省委负责同志多次审查，参加讨论。根据他们的意见，进行了加工、修改。由于党委指出了正确的方向，又给予我们以具体的指导，而且抓得紧，抓得准，抓得及时，才使黔剧事业能够沿着正确的道路飞速地前进。
    第二，贵州文艺工作的基础比较薄弱，艺术干部不算多，在这种情况下，我们怎能保证黔剧事业飞快的跃进呢？其中重要的一条就是集体创作，也就是在艺术上彻底走群众路线。现在上演的四个大戏，从剧本的创作、改编，到舞台的排练，舞台美术设计（包括服装、布景等），直到公演，都是在今年2月到5月这四个月的时间里完成的。能在这样短短的时间里完成这样大量的工作，就是因为采取了集体创作、走群众路线的办法。比如编剧，首先在创作组中讨论、明确主题思想，集体讨论提纲，然后分头分场写作，再指定专人修改贯通。每个剧本在初稿完成后，都经过许多次集体讨论，广泛吸收多方面的意见，继续加工修改。剧本基本完成后，即边排边改。再如导演，也是采取了集体导演的办法。导演组首先讨论、明确了每场的导演意图和主要人物、场面的处理，然后分头分场导演，再通过连排、通排、彩排统一风格，修改舞台处理手法。在整个排练期间，我们采取了编剧、导演、乐队、演员、舞台美术工作人员五结合，一切为了表现剧本中的主题思想，从各个不同角度为创造完美的舞台艺术形象而努力。
    第三，黔剧是一个新生的事物，也是贵州人民殷切希望迅速成长壮大的一株幼苗。为了它的发展，贵州艺术界，如京剧、川剧、评剧、越剧、话剧、花灯、歌舞等各个剧团都发挥了共产主义协作的精神，抽调了必要的骨干，辅导黔剧；或作示范演出，共同比较，共同提高。由于这样，才使黔剧有了高速度发展的条件。
    第四，由于黔剧是一个新的剧种，在各方面都还没有创造出一套完整的程式。从剧本的编写，到舞台表演，音乐唱腔，布景和服装设计，以至化装、灯光使用等等方面，如何掌握既不失去戏曲的特点，又能把现实生活中贵州各民族民间艺术的优秀成分，吸收到黔剧艺术，使黔剧成为一个能更好地为社会主义、共产主义事业服务的新型地方戏曲；如何使黔剧既能吸收各大剧种适合于自己的部分，融合成为自己的东西，而又保留浓厚的地方色彩，创造自己的独特风格，真正成为贵州各族人民特有的艺术形式，在这些重要的方面，我们都还没有摸索出一套成熟的经验。由于黔剧演员都是刚刚从事艺术事业不久的年轻人，而创作、导演、音乐、舞台美术工作人员又是从各方面调进来的知识分子和老艺人，如何使黔剧沿着正确的道路前进，这并不是没有斗争的。这些问题，不仅仅是艺术处理的问题，还是如何正确贯彻毛泽东文艺思想的问题。有的同志常常自觉地或不自觉地产生急躁的或保守的各种偏向。为了在发展黔剧事业上真正贯彻毛泽东文艺思想，按照党委指示的方向去做，剧团中经常开展两条道路的斗争，及时纠正政治上、艺术上各种不正确的、不健康的倾向，这是剧团政治思想工作中重要的一环。
    黔剧虽然在短短的两年时间里，迅速地发展成为一个初具独特风格的地方剧种，但是它终究还很年轻，比起其它兄弟剧种，都还极不完美和成熟。为了使这株幼苗成长得更加迅速和茁壮，使这枝初绽的花朵，开得更加鲜艳，还需要党的各级领导和全国艺术界对它多加培育。我们希望它能在伟大的毛泽东时代里，在祖国的百花齐放、万紫千红的社会主义文学艺术大花园里，为共产主义事业贡献它的力量。
