Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Vice Premier Chen Yi met today with the entire delegation of the Canadian Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, led by William Owen, National Councilor of the Canadian Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and held friendly talks with them.

William Owen said that he was surprised by China's progress, which was too fast. He said, "China loves peace and hopes to coexist peacefully with all countries in the world. It neither wants to seize other people's land nor allow others to invade its own."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people are concentrating all their efforts on building their own country. We need a peaceful international environment for construction, and we are also willing to see all countries in the world prosper. China has always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and has made unremitting efforts for this purpose.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, but we resolutely oppose the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism still occupies our sacred territory of Taiwan, it has established more than two hundred military bases in the world, and it acts arrogantly everywhere. The people of the world must resolutely resist and severely condemn the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism, so that it knows the powerful strength of the people of the world and dares not launch a war. Only in this way can lasting world peace be ensured.

Vice Premier Chen Yi righteously and sternly refuted the shameless slanders that smeared China as "warmongering." He said that China is not warmongering, China advocates that all international disputes should be resolved through negotiation, not through the use of force. But U.S. imperialism is too unreasonable and too barbaric, disturbing the peace of the whole world. It is the warmongering U.S. imperialism that should be condemned, not the peace-loving Chinese people. China has been harmed, and China has never harmed anyone. We are friendly to the American people, and the American people are also friendly to the Chinese people. We are willing to develop friendly relations with all countries, including Canada.

During the meeting, delegation members Mrs. Peterson, Tanner, Bronson, Peterson, and Stevens spoke about their impressions of visiting China. They were surprised by China's construction and believed that the Chinese people were "doing good things for mankind." Head of the delegation, William Owen, finally said that China is a great country, the Chinese and Canadian people are brothers, and China is engaged in great work, which must be completed victoriously. Vice Premier Chen Yi thanked the Canadian friends for their friendly remarks.

Also present at the meeting were Shen Jian, Director of the American and Australian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wu Xiaoda, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

    陈毅副总理在接见加拿大客人时说
    中国人民一贯爱好和平
    好战成性的美帝国主义闹得全世界不得安宁
    只有坚决抵抗美国战争政策才可能确保和平
    新华社25日讯　陈毅副总理今天接见了以加拿大平民合作联盟全国理事会理事威廉·欧文为首的加拿大平民合作联盟人士访华团全体成员，同他们进行了友好的谈话。
    威廉·欧文说，他对中国的进展感到惊奇，中国的进展太快了。他说：“中国是爱好和平的，希望和世界各国和平共处，既不想夺取别人的土地，也不允许别人侵占自己的土地。”
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民正在集中一切力量建设自己的国家，我们需要一个和平的国际环境以便进行建设，我们也愿意看到世界上所有的国家都能够繁荣起来。中国一贯主张世界上不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且为此作了不懈的努力。
    陈毅副总理说，但是我们坚决反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策。美帝国主义至今还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，它在世界上建立了二百多个军事基地，到处横行霸道。全世界人民必须坚决抵抗和严厉谴责美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，使它知道世界人民的强大力量，不敢发动战争，这样才可能确保世界的持久和平。
    陈毅副总理义正词严地驳斥了那些诬蔑中国“好战”的无耻谰言。他说，中国不是好战的，中国主张一切国际间的争端通过谈判解决，而不使用武力。但是美帝国主义太无理，太横蛮，闹得全世界不得安宁，应该受到谴责的是好战成性的美帝国主义，而不是爱好和平的中国人民，中国是被损害的，中国从来也没有损害过任何人。我们对美国人民是友好的，美国人民对中国人民也是友好的。我们愿意同一切国家包括加拿大在内发展友好关系。
    在接见的时候，访华团成员彼得逊夫人、坦纳、布朗森、彼得逊和斯蒂文斯等先后谈到了他们访问中国的观感。他们对中国的建设感到惊奇，认为中国人民在“为人类作好事情”。威廉·欧文团长最后说，中国是一个伟大的国家，中国人民和加拿大人民是兄弟，中国正在从事着巨大的工作，这个巨大的工作一定能够胜利完成。陈毅副总理感谢加拿大朋友们的友好讲话。
    接见时在座的，有外交部美澳司司长申健，中国人民外交学会副秘书长吴晓达。
