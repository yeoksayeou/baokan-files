    A Wedding in the Deep Mountains
    Zhu Weihao
    Tonight, our垦殖场 (Kenzi Chang) [Reclamation Farm] club turned on the lights extra early. Before it was even fully dark, more people had arrived than ever before. Everyone came, from the little kids to the old folks, and especially the young people.
    As the Youth League branch secretary and club director, I was in charge of hosting the event. But the real stars here weren't me, but the two young people: Jia Dahua, a young man from the farm, and Hu Yumei, a girl from the Guoyuanshan People's Commune. Each of them wore a large red flower on their chest, and the joy in their hearts was evident in the corners of their eyes and mouths.
    The playful young members of the amateur cultural troupe, while playing their instruments, kept glancing at them intentionally, and the children, eating fruit candies made by the processing plant, were also playfully imitating them, making the couple really embarrassed!
    I announced the start of the meeting. First, Secretary Li, the chairman of the meeting and officiant of the wedding, gave a speech. He straightened his collar, cleared his throat, and said, "Today is a celebration, and also a wedding. We celebrate their successful advanced technical creation, and also congratulate them on their successful romance..." Someone couldn't help but laugh, and he said seriously again, "What are you laughing at? This fruit didn't come easily!"
    Secretary Li looked at me as he spoke. I said, "That's right."
    Perhaps I understood it more intimately, didn't I? It was back in 1958, not long after we first came to the mountain, that my wife and I decided to settle down and build a life here, developing the mountain area, and we were the first couple to get married here. Back then, there wasn't a three-story building like today, and the wedding was held in a thatched shed; there were no electric lights, only dimly flickering oil-soaked firewood; and there was no band, only a few fiddles, a copper basin as a gong, and tapping on bamboo sections—a very interesting makeshift affair... Back then, this place was still a wilderness, the grass covered the plains, and wolves were still howling outside.
    Secretary Li finished speaking. He awarded them a bright red satin banner with the words: "Awarded to the Pioneers of the Technical Revolution." Everyone applauded vigorously. After a while, someone suggested, "Let's move on to the next item!" "Yes, seconded!"
    I announced the next item according to the agenda. A young man stood up and said, "Introduce the creation process and the love story, tell us! About the first time you met."
    The groom blushed immediately. The bride lowered her head, smiling shyly. After some "encouragement," Jia Dahua stood up, a little flustered: "The first time, at a joint production meeting of the垦殖场 (Kenzi Chang) [Reclamation Farm] and the agricultural cooperative..." He didn't finish before sitting down awkwardly. Everyone chimed in, chasing after him: "Tell us, tell us more!" The groom reluctantly stood up again and said, "To be honest, we only talked about business at that time, and didn't think about anything else." A young woman said humorously to the groom, "Tell us what you really thought!" Several people echoed, "Yes!" But Jia Dahua didn't say another word.
    The venue suddenly quieted down, and I quickly said, "Let the bride tell us, if it's the truth."
    It suddenly became noisy. Unexpectedly, the bride smiled and stood up, saying, "I'll tell you, what's there to be afraid of! At that time, I didn't think about it at all either. I'm a mountain woman, and he's an intellectual, a cadre sent to work in the countryside, how can I compare? I only thought we could exchange some experiences in forestry production. Later, strangely, we met again at the county's model worker conference. At that time, he was the captain of the youth forestry team, and he liked our mountains and wanted to be creative, saying he wanted to transport the big timber down the mountain. This time, I felt that he was on the same path as us. From then on, we..." Hu Yumei giggled, her face flushed, and said, "I can't say anymore, let him say it!"
    The young men disagreed, but the girls spoke up for the bride: "Let the groom speak, the groom hasn't said anything!"
    The groom wrung his hands, not saying anything. The girls started to make a fuss again. An idea popped into my head, and I quickly said, "If we don't give them a topic, how can they write an article?"
    "Yes, set a topic!" Many people agreed.
    "I'll set one," Secretary Li said enthusiastically, "Learning the scriptures and delivering treasures—how about that?"
    "Great!" Everyone applauded.
    Jia Dahua was pushed and pulled up by us. "How should I say it?" After a pause, he said, "Indeed, the success of the timber transportation network is due to everyone's efforts, but it is inseparable from their help. At first, she not only introduced us to the experience of the commune's forestry team in making wooden rails, but also helped us design the dragonfly chutes and aerial cableways. She even came to help with the construction, carrying an axe, leading us through the mountains to find suitable routes. ... I went to their forestry team three times, and she came three times, and that's how the Tianmu Ridge transportation network was built."
    "Only those three times? Not comprehensive!"
    "The bride should supplement!" Someone suggested.
    The bride was easy to talk to. As soon as the girls nudged her arm, she stood up: "Yes, I'll supplement. It's not comprehensive to only say that we helped him. Every time he came to our place, he also brought their experiences. When we went to Tianmu Ridge, we also learned a lot. The dragonfly chutes and aerial cableways were learned from them, and the Guoyuanshan transportation network was also designed with their help."
    A chubby girl pouted disapprovingly and said, "Still not comprehensive!"
    "Ah, right! He also helped us study culture." The bride quickly added.
    "Helping and helping, what else did he help you with?"
    Another girl lowered her voice to help the bride answer, "Three pairs of new—cloth—shoes!"
    The bride blushed and glared at her reproachfully. Everyone burst into laughter, and those nearby even looked at the groom's feet. Some people asked the groom, "What did you help her with?"...
    The wedding went on very late, and Secretary Li gave a few more words at the end before it broke up. I returned to the dormitory, turned on the light, and couldn't help but push open the window and look outside. The lights of the rows of dormitories from the foot of the east mountain to the foot of the west mountain had gone out. The mountains and plains merged into a blue-black expanse, with only some spots of light clustered in places. Tomorrow is Sunday, but the papermill and the mountain hotel construction site were bustling, with construction going on intensely, and the sound of the sawmill cutting wood could still be heard constantly. Secretary Li said at the end of the wedding, "Life is created by our own hands." Yes, our hands are still creating an even better life.

    深山里的婚事
    朱惟豪
    今晚我们垦殖场俱乐部老早就开着电灯了。天还没断黑，到的人比哪回都齐。从小娃子到老头没一个不来的，年轻人那就更不用说了。
    我是团支部书记兼俱乐部主任，会场由我来主持。可是这里的主人不是我，而是那二位年轻人：场里的小伙子贾大华、果沅山人民公社的姑娘胡玉妹。他们各人胸前戴一朵大红花，眉稍嘴角上露着心里的高兴。
    业余文工团俏皮的小伙子们，一边吹拉着，一边故意瞅着他们，娃儿们吃着加工厂制的水果糖，也乐哈哈的朝着他们装模做样，弄得人家委实不好意思哩！
    我宣布了开会。首先由会场的主席兼主婚人李书记讲话，他整了整领子，干咳了一声，就说：“今天是个庆祝会，也是个结婚会。我们庆祝他们的先进技术创造成功，也祝贺他们恋爱成功……”有人忍不住笑了，他又认真地说：“笑什么？这个果实来得很不容易！”
    李书记说着朝我望了一眼，我说：“是啊。”
    也许我体会得更亲切一些，不是么？那还是在1958年刚上山不久，我和爱人决心在山上安家立业，开发山区，第一对在这里结了婚。那时候没有今天这样的三层大楼，婚礼是在茅棚子里举行的；没有电灯，点着忽暗忽亮的油柴；也没有什么乐队，只有几把胡琴，铜盆当锣，敲打着竹节，土法上马，怪有趣的……那时候，这里还是一片荒野，草丛盖没了平地，狼还在外头嗥叫呢。
    李书记讲完了。他将一面发亮的红缎子锦旗奖给了他们，上面写着：“奖给技术革命的先锋”。大家使劲地鼓着掌。好一阵子，又有人建议：“进行下一项呀！”“对，赞成！”
    我又照仪程宣布了下一项。一个小伙子站起来说：“介绍创造经过和恋爱经过，说！第一次见面的时候。”
    新郎一下子脸红了。新娘低着头，羞怯地微笑着。经过了一番“动员”，贾大华站起来了，他有些发慌：“第一次，在垦殖场和农业社生产联席会上……”没说完，他窘窘地坐下来。大伙儿你一句她一句的追着：“说呀，说下去呀！”新郎没奈何地站起来，又说：“说实话，我们那时候只谈了些业务，没有想到别的。”有位姑娘对新郎诙谐地说：“没，说，心，里，话——”好几个人呼应着，“对！”可是贾大华再也不做声了。
    会场突然静了下来，我连忙说：“要新娘说说，是不是真心话。”
    一下子喧闹起来了，没料新娘子一笑，起身说：“说就说吧，怕啥！那时候我也是想都没想，我是山里妇女，人家是知识分子，下放干部，怎么比得上呢。我只想到我们可以交流林业生产上的一些经验。后来，奇怪，我们又在县劳模会上碰上了，那时候他是青年林业队的队长，他喜欢我们山里啦，还想搞创造，说什么把大木料运下山来。这回呀，我才觉得他和我们是一个道道上的。从那时候起，我们……”胡玉妹噗哧笑了，满脸飞红地说：“我说不来了，让他说吧！”
    小伙子们偏不同意，可是姑娘们七嘴八舌地为新娘子打抱不平了：“新郎说，新郎没说啥！”
    新郎搓着手，什么也没说出来。姑娘们又闹起来了。我脑子里一转，忙说：“没起题目，人家怎好做文章啊？”
    “对，出个题！”许多人表示赞成。
    “我来起，”李书记兴致勃勃地说，“取经送宝——好吧？”
    “好啊！”大伙儿鼓起掌来了。
    贾大华被我们推拉了起来。“怎么说好呢？”停一下，他说：“确实的，木材运输网的成功是大伙儿的力量，可与她们的帮助分不开。起初，她不但将公社林业队做木轨道的经验介绍给我们，而且帮助我们设计蜻蜓滑道，架空索道，施工时还提着斧子来帮忙，领我们跑山，找出合适的路线。……我到她们林业队去了三次，她来了三次，就这么着，天木岭的运输网搞成了。”
    “三次就这个内容？不全面！”
    “新娘子补充！”有人建议。
    新娘子好说话，姑娘们一触胳膊，她就站起来了：“对，我来补充。光说我们帮助他，不全面。他每次到我们这里来，也带了他们的经验。我们去天木岭，也学到了许多东西。蜻蜓滑道和架空索道就是从他们那里学来的，我们果沅山的运输网也是他们帮助设计的。”
    一位胖姑娘不满意地嘟着嘴说：“还不全面！”
    “啊，对啦！还帮我们学习文化。”新娘子连忙补充着。
    “帮呀帮的，还帮了人家什么呢？”
    另一位姑娘压低嗓子帮新娘子回答说：“三双新——布——鞋！”
    新娘子红着脸，埋怨地瞅了她一眼，大伙儿哄的一下子笑起来了，附近的还特意望望新郎的脚呢。有的问新郎：“你帮了人家什么呢？”……
    婚礼举行到很晚很晚，末了李书记又讲了几句话才散的。我回到宿舍，开着电灯，禁不住推开窗子朝外望去。东山脚到西山脚那一溜宿舍的灯熄了，山峦和平地连成一片蓝黑，只是有的地方聚集着一些光点。明天是星期天，可是造纸厂和山区饭店建筑工地喧闹着，那里正在紧张地施工，锯木厂锯木的声音还不断传来。李书记在婚礼结束时这样说，“生活，是由自己的双手创造的。”是的，我们的双手，还在创造更加美好的生活。
