Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 3rd: Hubei Province is stepping up late-stage management of early rice in various areas to strive for large ears, full grains, and heavy grains.

In order to strive for large-scale balanced production increases, many counties in Wuhan, Jingzhou, and other regions have recently convened meetings of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, and have gone deep into the fields to inspect and assess each plot of rice. They have adopted processing measures for the poorly growing third-class seedlings to promote them to catch up with the first and second-class seedlings. In the Beigang Commune of Chongyang County in the Wuhan area, a method of "one fertilizer and three supplements" (fertilizer supplements for sparse areas, fertilizer supplements for poor areas, and fertilizer supplements for late areas) was adopted, organizing 1,200 cadres and 20,000 laborers to vigorously apply topdressing to third-class seedlings. In order to achieve rational irrigation, many areas have designated experienced farmers to specifically monitor the water, so that early rice can not only "eat" well but also "drink" well during this period.

According to past experience, early rice is most susceptible to lodging and various diseases and insect pests as it approaches maturity. Therefore, grasping late-stage field management of early rice is a crucial key to striving for a bumper harvest. However, because early rice management in the early stages this year was relatively meticulous and growth was good, some cadres and the masses believed that a bumper early rice harvest was already a certainty. Some areas with poorer growth believed that the season had arrived and the overall situation was set, and they were not very enthusiastic and confident about strengthening late-stage management. In response to this situation, various areas promptly mobilized the masses to launch a major debate on "Whether or not early rice needs late-stage management," thoroughly breaking the "deterministic theory," which had a very good effect. For example, Qichun County, which has 400,000 mu of early rice, immediately launched a "three guarantees" and "five no's" late-stage management movement for early rice through the above-mentioned debate. The three guarantees are to guarantee plants, guarantee ears, and guarantee grains; the five no's are no drought, no floods, no diseases and insect pests, no barnyard grass, and no lodging. The Liuhe Commune in this county organized more than 4,000 laborers and established more than 500 management groups, and in a few days, they sprayed all 2,000 mu of early rice that had been infested with insects, and applied phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to more than 20,000 mu of early rice that was at risk of lodging in a timely manner.

Since sowing, Hubei Province's early rice has been frequently attacked by various natural disasters. In mid-to-late March this year, when early rice was being sown and seedlings were being raised, it was hit by continuous rain and encountered three relatively long cold waves. Entering April, the temperature in the province was still low, and some areas were hit by storms and hail. The abundant spring rain, many cloudy days, and long periods of low temperatures were very unfavorable for early rice growth. However, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, the people of Hubei Province fully exerted the great power of the people's communes and waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, achieving a decisive victory from sowing to transplanting. Afterwards, various areas immediately grasped the field management work. Whether it was weeding or topdressing, it was done better than in previous years. In order to strive for full seedlings, more seedlings, and strong seedlings, many counties in Huanggang, Jingzhou, Wuhan, and other regions, based on the characteristics of early rice this year, fixed leadership, labor, and measures, and achieved the method of "six earlies and one diligence," including early inspection and seedling replenishment, early topdressing of quick-acting fertilizers, early cultivation and weeding, early prevention and treatment of diseases and insect pests, early preparation for covering, and diligent irrigation. Many areas have also researched some effective methods to strive to shorten the tillering period of early rice in order to promote early tillering and more tillering of early rice.

At present, early rice in the province is budding, heading, flowering, and grain filling, and areas where transplanting was earlier will be harvested in just over half a month. Therefore, while strengthening late-stage management of early rice, various areas are starting to prepare for early rice harvesting and late rice transplanting as soon as possible. The commercial and handicraft departments in the Huanggang area, which has a large area of early rice this year, are actively organizing the supply of materials and the production of various tools to support early rice harvesting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 3rd: The vast number of cadres and members in the rural areas of Guangxi are insisting on carrying out late-stage field management of early rice to the end.

The climate in Guangxi after early rice transplanting this year was extremely abnormal. Spring drought and cold waves attacked several times, causing the early rice growing season to be delayed by about half a month compared with previous years. Now is the crucial period when early rice is about to ripen, and various areas are making persistent efforts, putting forward the slogan "Management does not stop until the grain enters the granary," and continuing to strengthen late-stage management. Ningming County, which first proposed "Completing the annual production task in half a year," immediately mobilized members to tap into increased production potential again after completing four cultivations and topdressings for early rice. In order to eliminate third-class seedlings and harvest more rice, the Tianxin Brigade of Munan Commune in this county mobilized the entire team and poured a shot of "rice fetus fertilizer" on all the rice seedlings in two days, and cleared all the weeds on the field ridges.

Yulin Prefecture is a region with a faster progress in early rice production. Half of the seedlings have completed four topdressings, and one-third have completed five topdressings. The members are not satisfied with this. Guiping County proposed: "Apply fertilizer one or two more times, and strive to harvest 70 to 100 jin more per mu"; Yulin County proposed: "Fight for half a month to attack the rice fetus and harvest one more basket of grain per mu."

The climate in Liuzhou Prefecture was cold for a long time after early rice transplanting, which affected seedling growth. Cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers went deep into the fields to study, summarized past experiences, and adopted methods of applying more lime and cinder to increase soil temperature, so as to promote early ripening, long ears, and large grains of seedlings, and strive for high yield. As of June 26, one-third of the early rice in the entire autonomous region had been fertilized with "rice fetus fertilizer," and topdressing is continuing. (Attached photo)

    勤排浅灌　合理追肥　除治虫害　防止倒伏
    湖北广西要把早稻后期管理坚持到底
    本报武汉3日电　湖北省各地抓紧早稻后期管理，力争穗大粒饱粒重。
    武汉、荆州等地区许多县为争大面积平衡增产，最近都召集干部、老农、技术人员开会，并且深入田间，对丘丘稻田都作了检查、鉴定，对生长不够好的三类苗采取了加工措施，促使三类苗追上一、二类苗。武汉地区的崇阳县北港公社采取了“一肥三补”（肥补稀、肥补瘦、肥补晚）的办法，组织了一千二百名干部，二万劳力，大抓三类苗的追肥。为了做到合理灌溉，许多地区就确定了有经验的老农专门看水，使早稻在这期间，不仅能
  “吃”好，而且能“喝”好。
    根据历年经验，早稻在接近成熟时，最易倒伏和发生各种病虫害。因此，抓好早稻后期田间管理，是争取早稻丰收的重要关键。但是，由于今年早稻前段管理比较精细，生长良好，因而部分干部群众认为早稻丰收已经不成问题。部分生长较差的地区则认为季节已到，大局已定，也对加强后期管理的劲头不大，信心不足。针对这种情况，各地及时发动群众，开展了“早稻要不要后期管理”的大辩论，大破
  “定局论”，效果很好。例如，拥有早稻四十万亩的圻春县，通过上述辩论，全县立即掀起了一个“三保”、“五无”的早稻后期管理运动。三保即保株、保穗、保粒；五无即无旱、无涝、无病虫、无稗草、无倒伏。这个县的刘河公社组织了四千多劳力，成立了五百多个管理小组，几天工夫，就把发虫的二千亩早稻全部打了药，并对二万多亩有倒伏危险的早稻及时施了磷钾肥。
    湖北省早稻从播种起，就受到了各种自然灾害频繁的袭击。今年3月中、下旬，正当早稻播种、育秧时，遭到连续的阴雨，还遇到三次时间较长的寒潮。进入4月，全省气温仍低，部分地区又受到风暴和冰雹的袭击。春雨多，阴天多，低温时间长，对早稻生长十分不利。但是，湖北省人民在各级党组织的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的巨大威力，同自然灾害作了顽强的斗争，取得了从播种到插秧的决定性的胜利。之后，各地立即抓紧了田间管理工作。无论薅草、追肥都比往年做得好。为了争取苗全、苗多、苗壮，黄冈、荆州、武汉等地区许多县，都根据今年早稻的特点，固定领导、劳力和措施，做到了早查苗补苗，早追施速效肥料，早中耕除草，早防治病虫害，早作好覆盖准备和勤排浅灌等“六早一勤”的办法。许多地区还研究出一些有效办法，力争缩短早稻返青期，以促使早稻早分蘖多分蘖。
    目前，全省早稻正在打苞抽穗，扬花灌浆，插秧较早的地区再有半个多月就收割了。因此，各地在加强早稻后期管理的同时，都及早动手准备早稻抢收和晚稻抢插工作。今年早稻面积较大的黄冈地区的商业、手工业部门，最近正积极组织物资供应和生产各种工具，支援早稻抢收。
    本报南宁3日电　广西农村广大干部和社员坚持把早稻后期田间管理进行到底。
    广西今年早稻插秧之后，气候极不正常。春旱和寒潮数次侵袭，以致早稻生长成熟期比往年延迟半月左右。现在正是早稻即将黄熟的关键时期，各地再接再厉，提出“谷不进仓管理不停”的口号，继续加强后期管理。首倡“全年包产任务半年完成”的宁明县，在结束早稻四次耘田追肥之后，马上又发动社员再挖增产潜力。这个县的睦南公社田心大队，为了消灭三类禾，多打稻谷，全队出动，两天中就给全部禾苗泼了一次禾胎肥，铲光了田埂杂草。
    玉林专区是早稻生产进度较快的地区，已有一半禾苗完成四次追肥，三分之一完成五次追肥。社员们并不以此为满足，桂平县又提出：“再施一两次肥，争取每亩多打七十斤到一百斤”；玉林县提出：“大战半月攻禾胎，每亩多打一箩谷”。
    柳州专区早稻插秧后长期气候较冷，影响禾苗生长。干部与技术员、老农深入田间研究，总结了过去的经验，采取多追石灰、火灰增加土温的办法，促使禾苗早熟、穗长、粒大，力争高产。到6月26日止，全自治区已有三分之一的早稻施完禾胎肥，现在正在继续追肥。（附图片）
