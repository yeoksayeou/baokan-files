Comrades:
　　I extend warm congratulations to all the representatives present on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation! And through you, I extend warm congratulations to the national literary and art workers!
　　Under the leadership of the Party, with the great victories achieved in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and with the deepening development of the ideological revolution and cultural revolution, China's literary and art work has shown an unprecedentedly prosperous, unprecedentedly popular, and improved great leap forward. Literature and art have been more widely and closely integrated with the masses; the transformation, strengthening, and development of the literary and art contingent, especially the active participation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, has greatly increased the new blood and combat strength of the literary and art contingent. Whether in literature, drama, film, fine arts, music, dance, folk art, folk literature, photography and other aspects of creation, all have achieved great harvests, unfolding before us a beautiful scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color.
　　Chairman Mao taught us that we must make literature and art an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and eliminate the enemy, and help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind. China's literary and art workers are precisely following this teaching and correctly playing the role of socialist literary and art weapons. Especially since 1958, under the guidance of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the Chinese people have been in high spirits, high morale, and full of vigor in making great contributions to the high-speed construction of socialism, demonstrating the heroic spirit and noble communist style of the Chinese people. Hundreds of millions of women have also actively plunged into the torrent of social labor, freed themselves from heavy housework, and undergone profound changes in their mental outlook, with countless new people and new things emerging. All this has become an inexhaustible source of creation for literary and art workers, and literary and art workers have already created many excellent works reflecting this great struggle and transformation. Among them, many moving images of heroic women have been shaped, truly reflecting the heroic struggles and great contributions made by Chinese women under the leadership of the Party in various revolutionary periods. Precisely because these literary and art works are full of revolutionary spirit, they have in turn greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm and fighting will of the masses, uniting and educating the masses to go all out to the lofty goals guided by the Party and Chairman Mao. Literary and art workers have also taken the posture of warriors, using literary and art weapons, to thoroughly expose the ugly prototype of American imperialism in front of the people of the whole country and the people of the world, and severely attacked American imperialism; and in the literary and art field, they have carried out a long-term and unremitting struggle against revisionist ideological trends and the influence of bourgeois political thought, defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and fully exerted the combat role of literature and art in serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, and serving socialist construction. These achievements on the literary and art front are inseparable from the efforts of all literary and art workers, including the efforts of female literary and art workers. We are very pleased to see that women have become an important force in the literary and art contingent. On the one hand, professional female literary and art workers have gained varying degrees of transformation and improvement, and have made many outstanding achievements; on the other hand, a large number of amateur literary and art workers from working women have emerged, and have demonstrated amazing creative and performing talents. This shows that working women, who have been excluded from literary and artistic activities for thousands of years, are today playing an important role in literary and artistic work as masters. This is a clear proof that the relationship between literature and art and the working people and the nature of literature and art itself have undergone profound changes. This is one of the major achievements in the transformation, strengthening and development of the entire literary and art contingent, and it is worthy of our warm congratulations. Comrades! The acquisition of all these achievements is a great victory for the Party's literary and art policy and a brilliant victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought.
　　Experience has proved that China's socialist literature and art are constantly growing and developing in the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. In the future, the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology will still be the primary task of our literary and art front. Our literary and art workers must always stand at the forefront of this struggle, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to take command. We must ensure the implementation of the Party's literary and art line and literary and art policy, use various literary and art weapons, and wage unremitting struggles against the influence of bourgeois political thought, resolutely oppose American imperialism and modern revisionism, and create more excellent works reflecting the great struggle of our times. The earth-shaking changes in Chinese women are an important aspect of reflecting this great struggle. Marx said: "The progress of society can be accurately measured by the social status of women." Therefore, we hope that literature and art can fully reflect the changes in various aspects of Chinese women, and from this aspect, more profoundly reflect the depth and breadth of China's epochal changes, so as to promote the sustained great leap forward of socialist construction.
　　Comrades! In order to continuously strengthen and improve the combat effectiveness of the literary and art contingent, all literary and art workers need to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong more diligently and conscientiously, firmly establish the proletarian world outlook, and thoroughly transform the bourgeois world outlook; participate in the current great changes in China more resolutely and more deeply; go deeper into the masses, strengthen labor training, and cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people; learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers with humility, and learn from their distinct class character and combativeness in class struggle and production struggle, as well as in literary and artistic creation. Only by learning from the masses and making literature and art more closely integrated with the masses can China's literary and art cause continue to achieve new and greater prosperity, popularization and improvement.
　　At present, the domestic and international situation is very good. This excellent situation not only puts forward the requirements for further development and improvement of China's literature and art, but also creates favorable conditions for the further development and improvement of China's literature and art. Let us unite more closely, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and follow the path of literary and art development pointed out by Chairman Mao of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new in the direction of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers and serving the socialist cause, go all out, aim high, and continuously improve the ideological level and artistic level, and make greater contributions to striving for a greater leap forward in socialist literature and art and to building socialism at high speed.
　　I wish the conference a complete success!

    塑造动人的英雄妇女的形象
    全国妇联副主席李德全在全国文艺工作者代表大会上的祝词同志们：
    我代表全国妇联向到会的全体代表致以热烈的祝贺！并通过你们向全国文学艺术工作者致以热烈的祝贺！
    在党的领导下，随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得伟大的胜利，随着思想革命和文化革命的深入发展，我国的文学艺术工作，出现了空前繁荣、空前普及和提高的大跃进局面。文艺已经更广泛、更紧密地和群众结合起来；文艺队伍的改造、壮大和发展，特别是广大的工农兵群众的积极参加，大大增加了文艺队伍新的血液和战斗力量。不论在文学、戏剧、电影、美术、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、民间文艺、摄影等方面的创作，都获得了大丰收，展现在我们面前的是一幅百花齐放、万紫千红的美景。
    毛主席教导我们要使文艺成为整个革命机器的组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。我国的文艺工作者正是遵循着这个教导，正确地发挥了社会主义文艺武器的作用。特别是1958年以来，在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，我国人民精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发地为高速度建设社会主义作出了伟大的贡献，显示了我国人民的英雄气概和崇高的共产主义的风格。亿万妇女也积极投入了社会劳动的洪流，摆脱了繁重的家务劳动，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，出现了无数的新人新事。这一切都成为文艺工作者创作的无穷无尽的源泉，而且文艺工作者已经创造了许多反映这种伟大斗争和变革的优秀作品。其中也塑造了许多动人的英雄妇女的形象，真实地反映了我国妇女在党的领导下，在各个革命时期所作的英勇斗争和巨大贡献。正由于这些文艺作品充满着革命精神，它又转过来大大鼓舞了群众的劳动热情和斗争意志，团结和教育了群众全力奔赴党和毛主席指引的崇高目标。文艺工作者还以战士的姿态，用文艺的武器，在全国人民、全世界人民面前，彻底揭露了美帝国主义的丑恶原形，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义；并在文艺领域内与修正主义思潮和资产阶级的政治思想影响，进行了持久不懈的斗争，保卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，充分发挥了文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务的战斗作用。文艺战线上的这些成就，是和全体文艺工作者的努力分不开的，其中包括了女文艺工作者的努力。我们很高兴地看到妇女已成为文艺队伍中一支重要的力量。一方面专业的女文艺工作者已经获得了不同程度的改造和提高，做出了不少出色的成绩；另一方面来自工农劳动妇女的业余文艺工作者大量涌现，并且表现了惊人的创作和表演才能。这说明了千百年来被排斥在文艺活动之外的劳动妇女，在今天，已以主人翁的姿态，在文艺工作中起着重要的作用。这正是文艺和劳动人民的关系以及文艺本身的性质发生了深刻变化的一个明证。这是整个文艺队伍改造、壮大和发展的重大成就之一，值得我们热烈地祝贺。同志们！这一切成就的获得，都是党的文艺方针的伟大胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    经验证明，我国的社会主义文艺是在兴无灭资的斗争中不断地成长壮大起来的。在今后，兴无灭资的斗争，仍然是我们文艺战线上首要的斗争任务。我们文艺工作者要永远站在这个斗争的最前列，坚持用毛泽东的思想挂帅。要保证党的文艺路线和文艺方针的贯彻执行，运用各种文艺武器，和资产阶级的政治思想影响作不懈的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义，更多地创造出反映我们时代伟大斗争的优秀作品。我国妇女翻天复地的变化，正是反映了这个伟大斗争的一个重要方面。马克思说：“社会的进展可以准确地由女性的社会地位来衡量”。因此我们希望文学艺术方面能充分反映我国妇女各方面的变化，从这方面来更深刻地反映我国时代变革的深度和广度，来促进社会主义建设的持续大跃进。
    同志们！为了不断地加强和提高文艺队伍的战斗力，就需要全体文艺工作者更努力、更认真地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，巩固地树立无产阶级的世界观，彻底改造资产阶级的世界观；更加坚决、更加深入地投身到当前我国的伟大变革中去；更加深入群众，加强劳动锻炼，培养劳动人民的思想感情；虚心向工农兵学习，学习他们在阶级斗争和生产斗争中以及文艺创作中所表现的鲜明的阶级性、战斗性。只有向群众学习，使文艺和群众更加紧密结合起来，才能使我国的文艺事业不断获得新的更大的繁荣、普及和提高。
    目前，国内外形势好得很。这种大好形势，不仅对我国的文学艺术提出了进一步发展和提高的要求，同时也为我国文艺的进一步发展和提高创造了有利条件。让我们更紧密地团结起来，高举起毛泽东思想红旗，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，沿着毛主席所指引的在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的文艺发展的道路，鼓足干劲、力争上游，不断提高思想水平和艺术水平，为争取社会主义文学艺术的更大跃进，为高速度地建设社会主义作出更大的贡献。
    祝大会胜利成功！
