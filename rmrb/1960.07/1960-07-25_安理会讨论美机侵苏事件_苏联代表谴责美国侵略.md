Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 22nd (TASS dispatch): At the request of the Soviet Union, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting on July 22nd to discuss the issue of the new aggressive actions by the U.S. Air Force against the Soviet Union, which threaten world peace.

    After the meeting approved the agenda, the Soviet representative, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuznetsov, spoke.

    Kuznetsov recounted that this was the second time this year that the Soviet Union had raised the issue of the United States continuing to take aggressive actions with the Security Council. He emphasized that the intrusion of a U.S. bomber into Soviet territory proves that the U.S. government is continuing down the path of harming the cause of peace, which led to the breakdown of the four-power summit. This U.S. approach has been unanimously condemned by world public opinion.

    On behalf of the Soviet government, Kuznetsov put forward a draft resolution for the Security Council to consider. The draft resolution suggests that the Security Council condemn the U.S. for continuing to take provocative actions and considers this an act of aggression. The draft resolution also demands that the U.S. government immediately cease such actions and prevent such incidents from recurring.

    U.S. representative Lodge then made a two-minute speech, in which he groundlessly insisted that the U.S. "RB-47" aircraft was shot down fifty nautical miles from the Soviet coast.

    The Security Council adjourned until July 25th.

    安理会讨论美机侵苏事件
    苏联代表谴责美国侵略
    新华社24日讯　塔斯社纽约22日讯：联合国安全理事会22日在苏联要求下举行会议，讨论美国空军对苏联的新的侵略行动威胁世界和平的问题。
    在会议批准议程后，由苏联代表、苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫发言。
    库兹涅佐夫追述说，苏联在今年已经是第二次向安理会提出美国继续采取侵略行动的问题。他强调指出，一架美国轰炸机侵犯苏联边境，这证明美国政府继续走导致四国政府首脑会议破裂的危害和平事业的道路。美国这种作法已经受到世界舆论的一致谴责。
    库兹涅佐夫奉苏联政府命令，提出一个决议草案，供安理会考虑。这个决议草案建议安理会谴责美国继续采取挑衅行动，并且认为这是侵略行为。决议草案还要求美国政府立即停止这种行动，并且防止这类事情重演。
    美国代表洛奇接着发表了两分钟的讲话，他毫无根据地硬说，美国“RB—47型”飞机是在离苏联海岸五十浬的地方被击落的。
    安理会就此休会到7月25日。
