Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20th: A joint communiqué on the talks between Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Cuban Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro was released in Moscow.

The communiqué stated that during Raúl Castro's visit to the Soviet Union, he exchanged views with Khrushchev on Soviet-Cuban relations and other pressing international issues.

Entrusted by the government of the Republic of Cuba and Prime Minister Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet government and Khrushchev for Khrushchev's statement that the Soviet Union is using all its strength to support Cuba and its heroic people in their struggle for freedom and national independence. The socialist countries and the people of countries who stand for peace will support the just struggle of the Cuban people, and no one can enslave the Cuban people. Raúl Castro said that the Cuban people will never forget this lofty statement and assistance from the Soviet Union, which will forever be recorded in Cuban history and the history of the people of Latin American countries.

Both sides emphasized that the facts of the recent period show that certain groups in the United States have not abandoned their plans for armed aggression against Cuba, and the freedom and independence of the Republic of Cuba are under constant threat of being strangled by force. Therefore, the people of all countries, especially the people of Latin America, should maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times and not allow bandit aggression against the Cuban people, who are heroically defending their hard-won freedom and national sovereignty, under any pretext and in any form—openly or covertly.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that the governments of Latin American countries will consider the strong will of their own people and will not allow themselves to be involved in the dark dealings of American monopolies and militarists against Cuba.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people, based on their own personal experience, know the insidious policies of the imperialists, who in the past had used every means to strangle the young Soviet Republic, adopting both armed intervention and methods such as starvation and economic blockade. The imperialists are currently intensifying their economic blockade against Cuba, attempting to destroy the heroic spirit and will of the Cuban people with unprecedented economic suppression. However, the people will not allow, and will not allow in the future, international reactionaries to realize their conspiracies.

Both sides emphasized that the Cuban revolution and the cause of peace, freedom, and independence for which the Cuban people are fighting are the common cause of all people who defend national independence and the possibility of determining their own destiny.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people deeply support the struggle of the Cuban people. Both sides expressed their firm belief that all people will support the Republic of Cuba and help it smash the economic blockade. Now, the socialist camp is so strong, and its economic strength is so abundant, that it can provide Cuba with all the necessary commodities that the United States and certain other capitalist countries now refuse to give it, based on the development of normal trade relations. Khrushchev said that the Soviet government is willing to provide Cuba with oil and other commodities that can fully meet Cuba's needs, in exchange for Cuban goods.

Raúl Castro emphasized that the Cuban people's determination to fight to defend their freedom, independence, and all the achievements of the Cuban revolution is unwavering and as solid as a rock. Now, all the Cuban people are living and fighting under the slogan: "Homeland or Death," which expresses the unwavering will of all the people to defend the freedom they have gained, the achievements of the Cuban revolution, and to guarantee Cuba's development along the path of peace, democracy, and social progress.

Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, expressed warm support for the noble struggle of the Cuban people. Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet Union will do everything in its power to prevent the United States from carrying out armed intervention against the Republic of Cuba.

Minister Raúl Castro, entrusted by the Cuban government and Prime Minister Fidel Castro, once again conveyed to Khrushchev a friendly invitation to pay a state visit to the Republic of Cuba. Khrushchev reiterated his agreement to visit Cuba and assured that this visit would definitely take place. At the same time, Khrushchev reiterated his invitation to Prime Minister Fidel Castro to visit the Soviet Union. Khrushchev concluded by expressing his belief that the just cause of the Cuban people will surely triumph, that the Cuban people will surely overcome all the obstacles and difficulties imposed on them by the imperialist countries, and will surely defend the fruits that are beneficial to peace and to friendship between the peoples of the Americas and the peoples of the rest of the world.

Khrushchev said that we are deeply convinced that the friendly relations between our two countries and our two peoples, based on non-interference, complete equality, and mutual respect, will be further consolidated and developed day by day.

The exchange of views between Khrushchev and Raúl Castro took place in an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding and sincere friendship.

    赫鲁晓夫  劳尔·卡斯特罗发表会谈公报
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：莫斯科发表了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和古巴共和国革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗会谈公报。
    公报说，在劳尔·卡斯特罗访问苏联期间，他曾同赫鲁晓夫就苏联—古巴关系和其他迫切的国际问题交换了意见。
    劳·卡斯特罗受古巴共和国政府和菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理的委托，向苏联政府和赫鲁晓夫表示古巴共和国政府和全体古巴人民深切的感谢，感谢赫鲁晓夫曾声明，苏联正在利用一切力量来支持古巴和它的英勇的人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争。社会主义国家和站在和平立场上的各国人民将支持古巴人民的正义斗争，任何人都不能奴役古巴人民。劳·卡斯特罗说，古巴人民永远不会忘记苏联这一崇高的声明和援助，它们将永远载入古巴历史和拉丁美洲各国人民的历史中。
    双方强调指出，最近一个时期的事实说明，美国的某些集团并没有放弃武装侵犯古巴的计划，古巴共和国的自由和独立遭受到被武力窒息的经常威胁。因此，各国人民、首先是拉丁美洲人民应当经常保持高度的警惕，不许在任何幌子下和以任何形式——公开地或隐蔽地对正在英勇地捍卫已经获得自由和民族主权的古巴人民进行强盗侵略。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，拉丁美洲各国政府将会考虑本国人民的坚强意志，并且不许参与美国垄断组织和军国主义者对古巴所进行的黑暗勾当。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民根据自己的亲身经验，知道帝国主义者的阴谋政策，帝国主义者过去曾经用尽了一切手法来扼杀年轻的苏维埃共和国，既采用过武装干涉的办法，也采用过饥饿和经济封锁等办法。帝国主义者目前加紧对古巴进行经济封锁，企图用空前未有的经济镇压来摧毁古巴人民的英勇精神和意志。但是，人民不容许、将来也不容许国际反动派实现阴谋诡计。
    双方着重指出，古巴的革命和古巴人民为之奋斗的和平、自由和独立的事业，是捍卫民族独立和决定本国命运可能性的所有人民的共同事业。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民深切支持古巴人民的斗争。双方表示确信：所有人民都将支持古巴共和国，帮助它粉碎经济封锁。现在，社会主义阵营国家力量之强大，它们经济实力之雄厚，完全可以在发展正常贸易关系的基础上向古巴提供现在美国和某些其他资本主义国家拒绝给予它的一切必要商品。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府愿意向古巴提供可以完全满足古巴需求的石油和其他商品，并换取古巴的商品。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴人民为捍卫自己的自由、独立和古巴革命的一切成果而进行斗争的决心是决不动摇的，它像岩石一般坚硬。现在，全体古巴人民都生活和斗争在这样一个口号下：“誓死保卫祖国”，这个口号表达了全体人民捍卫已经获得的自由、古巴革命的成果和保证古巴沿着和平、民主和社会进步的道路发展的不可动摇的意志。
    赫鲁晓夫代表苏联政府和苏联人民表示热烈支持古巴人民所进行的崇高斗争。赫鲁晓夫重申，苏联尽一切力量不允许美国对古巴共和国进行武装干涉。
    劳·卡斯特罗部长受古巴政府和菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理的委托，再次向赫鲁晓夫转达了请他到古巴共和国进行国事访问的友好邀请。赫鲁晓夫再次表示他同意访问古巴，并保证说一定要进行这次访问。赫鲁晓夫同时再次邀请菲·卡斯特罗总理访问苏联。赫鲁晓夫最后表示相信，古巴人民的正义事业必将获胜，古巴人民必将克服帝国主义国家强加给他们的一切障碍和困难，必将捍卫住有利于和平以及美洲各国人民和世界其他各国人民之间的友谊的果实。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们深信，我们两国和我们两国人民之间的以互不干涉、完全平等和互相尊重为基础的友好关系，将会更加巩固和日益发展。
    赫鲁晓夫和劳尔·卡斯特罗之间的交换意见，是在完全相互谅解和真诚友好的气氛中进行的。
