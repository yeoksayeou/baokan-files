    Medical Personnel Join the Fight Against Drought and Rush Planting Campaign

    More than 2,000 medical and healthcare personnel in Zhecheng County, Henan Province, after ensuring the health of the county's 460,000 people and the successful completion of the summer harvest, and encouraged by the slogan "Do not dismount, do not lay down arms, take advantage of the victory and continue to fight," quickly joined the fight against drought and rush planting campaign. They conducted day and night mobile medical services, quickly restoring more than 100 heatstroke victims to health, accelerating the progress of the fight against drought and rush planting campaign.

    The 2,650 medical and healthcare workers in Zhecheng County were very enthusiastic in supporting the wheat harvest. Each comrade earnestly went deep into the fields to carry out day and night mobile medical services, achieving a combination of prevention, treatment, labor, and propaganda. In order to enable all medical and healthcare personnel to continue to participate in the fight against drought and rush planting campaign, ensure the health of the drought-fighting army and the smooth progress of the campaign, Liu Wenxiu, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, and Wu Mingzhen, of the Health Section, held telephone conferences with the Deputy Secretaries of the Commune Party Committees and the Ministers of Culture and Health and Hospital Directors of each commune on June 5th and 6th respectively. They reported on the continued participation of all medical and healthcare workers in the fight against drought and rush planting, and the strict prevention of heatstroke, and required all communes and teams to quickly establish field heatstroke prevention stations, add more sunshades and tea stations to provide sufficient boiled water to replenish the physical consumption of the members.

    Under the unified call of the County Party Committee, 364 field heatstroke prevention stations were established in various communes and teams throughout the county. On the basis of the original 2,736 sunshades and 2,516 tea stations, 1,759 sunshades and 1,387 tea stations were added, so that wherever there was a drought-fighting and rush planting army, there were heatstroke prevention stations, sunshades and tea supply stations. The requirements were that there be sunshades for cooling off, boiled water for thirst, and timely treatment for heatstroke victims without leaving the fields. Zheng Qirui, Secretary of the Cisheng Commune Party Committee, mobilized the masses to build 127 sunshades overnight, realizing the shading of the fields. When it was discovered that the Songtun Production Team lacked firewood and the tea supply was insufficient, he promptly helped the team solve the problem of firewood and ensured the supply of boiled water. During the mobile medical services, 38 medical personnel in Anping Commune discovered that there were few varieties and insufficient quantities of summer medicines. They promptly used their brains to come up with a solution and used local methods to produce more than 20 kinds of summer medicines, worth more than 520 yuan, which saved the country funds and solved practical problems in treatment. The members said with emotion: "You are good cadres under the leadership of Chairman Mao, you help us fight drought and you help us treat diseases, you think of everything for the people."

    医务人员投入抗旱抢种运动
    河南柘城县二千多名医务和保健人员，在保证全县四十六万人民身心健康、胜利结束夏收工作的基础上，在“将不下马、兵不卸甲，乘胜之风，继续战斗”的口号鼓舞下，又迅速投入了抗旱抢种运动，开展了日夜巡回医疗，使一百多个中暑者迅速恢复健康，加速了抗旱抢种运动的进展。
    柘城县二千六百五十名医务和保健员，在支援麦收中，情绪非常高涨，每个同志都认真的深入田间，开展日夜巡回医疗、做到了预防、治疗、劳动、宣传四结合。为了使全体医务和保健人员继续投入抗旱抢种运动，确保抗旱大军健康和抗旱抢种运动的开展，县委书记处书记刘文秀同志和卫生科吴明珍同志，在6月5日、6日分别召开公社党委副书记会和各公社文卫部长、卫生院长电话会，对于全体医务和保健员继续投入抗旱抢种、严防中暑现象发生，作了报告，并要求各社、队迅速建立田间防暑站、增设凉棚和茶水站，以供充足的开水，补足社员身体消耗的需要。
    全县各社、队在县委的统一号召下，建立田间防暑站三百六十四个，在原有二千七百三十六个凉棚，二千五百十六个茶水站的基础上，又增设了凉棚一千七百五十九个，茶水站一千三百八十七个，做到了哪里有抗旱抢种大军，哪里有防暑站、凉棚和茶水供应站、取凉有凉棚，渴了有开水，中暑不出地及时可以医治的要求。慈圣公社党委书记郑其瑞同志，发动群众一夜间建凉棚一百二十七个，实现了田间凉棚化。发现宋屯生产队因缺柴茶水供给不足时，随时帮助该队解决了烧柴问题，保证了开水的供应。安平公社三十八名医务人员，在巡回医疗中，发现夏令药品种少数量不足，及时开动脑子想了办法，利用土法制出夏令药品二十多种，价值五百二十多元，既给国家节省了资金，又解决治疗中的实际问题。社员们感动地说：“你们是毛主席领导下的好干部，既帮助俺抗旱，又帮助俺治病，为了人民啥都想到了。”
