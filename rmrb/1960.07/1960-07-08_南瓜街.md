    "Pumpkin Street"

    "Pumpkin Street," you've probably never heard this new name before. But it definitely exists, it definitely has this name, and it's located in the Zhepeng Village of the Luxi Commune in Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province. It only took three months from groundbreaking to completion.

    This "Pumpkin Street" is indeed novel. The street is over a mile long, with a main road running straight through the center. The houses are built from sturdy wooden pillars and bowl-sized bamboo, with pumpkin vines winding up and down like iron cables on a seagoing vessel. Dense pumpkin leaves, larger than the palm-leaf fans Grandma uses now, provide shade. Golden-yellow pumpkin flowers, like large trumpets, bloom profusely, and pumpkins, larger than the New Year lanterns people hang in front of their doors, hang crowded together. Even though the June sun is scorching overhead, it's surprisingly cool and comfortable to walk on the street, making you feel like you're basking in a beautiful spring.

    A street, of course, has its signs. But the signs on Pumpkin Street are also new and fresh. They aren't for fabric stores or restaurants, but rather say "Pingxiang Luxi Commune Horticultural Farm No. X Team Youth, Militia, Women Pumpkin High-Yield Experiment," and so on. Therefore, there is no trading on the street, only the sounds of labor, the triumphal songs of the Great Leap Forward, and the fine wine of harvest...inspiring you with fighting spirit, high morale, invigorated spirit, and a cheerful mood.

    However, there is also something that makes people feel a little worried: the pumpkins are growing so well, each one heavy and laden. Although the vines are thick and strong, and the pumpkins are tied securely with straw ropes, you still can't help but worry, fearing that the pumpkins will break the stems and ropes, fall on you, or injure your head!

### “南瓜街”

    “南瓜街”
    “南瓜街”，这个新名字你当然还是第一回听说。但它确有其地，确有其名，它座落在江西省萍乡芦溪公社的蔗棚村，从建基到落成只有三个月的时间。
    这“南瓜街”，的确新颖，街长一里多路，大马路直穿街心，房子是用结实的木柱和碗大的竹子搭成的，上上下下绕着像海船上的铁索似的南瓜藤，密密麻麻遮着比老奶奶现在搧的蒲扇还大的南瓜叶，满开着像大喇叭一样的金黄色南瓜花，挤悬着比新年人家挂在门前的大灯笼还要大的南瓜。尽管6月的太阳在天顶烧，在街上来往也是凉爽爽的怪舒服，使你似乎沐浴在美丽的春天里。
    街嘛，当然有牌号，南瓜街的牌号可又新鲜，既不是布匹门市部，也不是饮食店，而是“萍乡芦溪公社园艺场第某队青年、民兵、妇女南瓜高产试验”等字样，因此，街上没有交易，只有劳动的号子，大跃进的凯歌，丰收的美酒。……使你斗志昂扬，意气风发，精神振奋，心情舒畅。
    不过，也有一点使人感到耽心：南瓜实在长得好，个个沉甸甸的，瓜藤虽然粗壮，又有草绳把南瓜系得牢牢的，可是总放心不下，硬怕南瓜会拉断茎和绳，落在自己身上，或者砸伤了头颅哩！
