Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 23rd: The German Democratic Republic government has sent a note to the Polish People's Republic government, drawing attention to the danger posed to the Baltic Sea region by the revanchist and aggressive policies of West German militarism, and advocating the signing of bilateral or multilateral treaties of friendship and cooperation or treaties of non-aggression to strengthen peace in the Baltic Sea region and make the Baltic Sea a sea of peace. In response to the note from the German Democratic Republic government, the Polish People's Republic Foreign Ministry delivered a reply note to the German Democratic Republic Embassy in Warsaw.

The reply note stated that the Polish People's Republic government, like the German Democratic Republic government, is deeply concerned about making the Baltic Sea region a region of peaceful relations and constructive cooperation between the countries in the region, i.e., a sea of peace. However, the desire to establish peaceful relations in the Baltic Sea region is seriously obstructed by the West German government, which arises from its entire foreign policy, especially its militarist policy.

The reply note pointed out that the Polish People's Republic government fully agrees with the German Democratic Republic government's view that West Germany's militarist measures, especially those taken in the Baltic Sea region, pose a serious threat to the development of peaceful relations in this region of Europe. In this regard, it cannot be ignored that the West German government is particularly stepping up its attempts to equip its armed forces with the most modern weapons of mass destruction.

The reply note said that the Polish People's Republic government believes that the treaty proposed by the German Democratic Republic government, which would help guarantee and strengthen peaceful relations between the countries of the Baltic Sea region, would be in the interests of the peoples of all countries in the region. The Polish People's Republic government is ready to do its utmost to support the efforts of the German Democratic Republic government and various other initiatives aimed at achieving this goal.

    波兰支持德意志民主共和国政府的和平倡议
    斥西德加紧武装威胁和平
    新华社24日讯　据波兰通讯社华沙23日讯：德意志民主共和国政府曾照会波兰人民共和国政府，提请注意由于西德军国主义的复仇主义侵略政策而给波罗的海地区所造成的危险，并且主张签定双边的或者多边的友好合作条约或者互不侵犯的条约，以加强波罗的海地区的和平和使波罗的海成为和平的海洋。针对德意志民主共和国政府的照会，波兰人民共和国外交部交给德意志民主共和国驻华沙大使馆一份复照。
    复照说，波兰人民共和国政府表示，它同德意志民主共和国政府一样，深切关心使波罗的海地区成为这个地区各国之间和平关系和建设性合作的地区，即成为一个和平的海洋。但是，希望建立波罗的海地区和平关系的愿望遭到西德政府方面的严重阻碍，这种严重阻碍产生于它的整个外交政策、特别是军国主义政策。
    复照指出，波兰人民共和国政府完全同意德意志民主共和国政府的意见，认为西德的军国主义措施、特别是在波罗的海地区采取的军国主义措施对欧洲这个地区和平关系的发展是一个严重的威胁。在这方面，不能无视的是：西德政府特别加紧企图用最现代化的大规模毁灭性武器装备自己的武装部队。
    复照说，波兰人民共和国政府认为，德意志民主共和国政府提出的、有助于保证和加强波罗的海地区国家之间和平关系的条约将是符合这个地区各国人民的利益的。波兰人民共和国政府准备尽力支持德意志民主共和国政府的努力以及其他各种旨在达到这个目的的倡议。
