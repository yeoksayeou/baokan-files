Xinhua News Agency, Changchun -- As summer hoeing began, a number of cadres familiar with rural work and with leadership experience went deep into the production teams, changing from short-term team assignments to long-term part-time positions, further strengthening the leadership of summer hoeing.

Yushu County Party Committee, Jilin Province, organized a large number of county, commune, and management district level cadres to go deep into the front line of production as part-time deputy captains of production teams during the summer hoeing production, which enhanced the leadership strength of grassroots units and promoted faster and better progress in summer hoeing production. The time for plowing and weeding each field has been shortened from about thirteen days in previous years to about eight days. At present, various crops in the county are growing well, and there are very few second- or third-class seedlings.

During the spring plowing production period, the Yushu County Party Committee organized more than 8,500 cadres at the county, commune, and district levels to combine with the broad masses of commune members to carry out field campaigns, which promoted the early completion of spring plowing production quickly and well. As summer hoeing began, the County Party Committee, starting from the summary of spring plowing production, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of this year's summer hoeing production, such as heavy tasks, high requirements for field operation quality, tight labor, and particularly the wasted labor caused by many rainy days. It was decided to further strengthen grassroots leadership, in addition to continuing to adhere to the leadership method of cadres and the masses holding field campaigns, the working method of some cadres familiar with rural work and with leadership experience would be developed from short-term team assignments and mobile campaigns to long-term fixed and part-time team assignments, further strengthening the leadership of summer hoeing. Now, more than 3,000 county, commune, and district cadres are serving as part-time deputy captains in production teams.

After these cadres took part-time positions as deputy captains of production teams, they ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the masses, finding key points and tackling key problems. Wang Rong, Deputy Secretary of the Chengba Management District Branch of the Chengba Commune, found that commune members were reluctant to use improved tools and that plowing and weeding were slow after he took a part-time position as deputy captain of the First Production Team in the district. After he learned that the weeding hoes were not easy to use, he found carpenters and plowmen to study together and repeatedly modify them. As a result, he modified a cultivating and weeding tool that could be used for both plowing and weeding, and the work efficiency was eight times higher than that of manual weeding. The Commune Party Committee immediately held an on-site meeting in this production team and modified all 382 weeding hoes in the commune. This shortened the plowing and weeding time for dry land in the entire commune from once every thirteen days to once every five days. The experience of the combination of cadres, carpenters, and plowmen in Chengba Commune in modifying and using new tools promoted the modification and use of more than 7,000 three-furrow weeders, five-tooth cultivators, and furrow plows throughout the county, increasing the daily progress of plowing and weeding by 61% compared to the original.

Because these cadres have rich production experience and leadership ability, they quickly helped production team leaders improve their leadership level after they arrived in various production teams. He Xuefang, the production team leader of Xinzhuang Commune, worked very well, but his leadership level was low. He only knew how to take the lead in hard work and did not know how to arrange production and rationally organize labor, which often led to wasted work and low labor efficiency in production. After Liu Jun, the part-time deputy captain, discovered this, he taught He Xuefang how to arrange work and formulate small-scale work plans in his actual work, so that He Xuefang learned a complete set of methods for organizing production and leading production. During summer hoeing, he assigned women with children and elderly and weak auxiliary laborers to plow nearby, clean land, and strong and skilled commune members to plow distant, barren land according to the physical strength, skill level, distance, and cleanliness of the land of the male and female commune members participating in production. As a result, the labor efficiency of the entire team increased by 20%.

These part-time deputy captains also helped production team leaders organize and arrange the lives of commune members. In Sihe Commune, there are seventy-two canteens. With the help of part-time deputy captains, the canteens have diversified their meals and solved the problem of some canteens lacking tables and benches, allowing commune members to eat their fill and eat well, attracting more commune members to participate in public canteens, freeing up more than 2,540 laborers and auxiliary laborers to participate in summer hoeing production.

When the Yushu County Party Committee organized cadres to serve as part-time deputy captains in production teams, it also paid special attention to strengthening leadership in backward areas, sending a large number of commune party committee members and management district branch secretaries to backward production teams, which changed the face of most backward production teams. The Fifth Production Team of Dongfeng Management District of Baoshou Commune has always been a backward team with poor production and low grain yields. At the beginning of this year's summer hoeing, the Commune Party Committee sent Sun Xianwu, Propaganda Committee Member of the Party Committee, and Hou Shoutang, Deputy Secretary of the Dongfeng Management District Branch, to serve as part-time deputy captains. They took the lead in plowing, thinning seedlings, and topdressing with the captain in production, making all 21,550 mu of land in the team first-class seedlings, and were rated as an advanced production team in the entire commune. Now, most of the backward teams in the county have changed their appearance, and eighty-five backward teams have joined the ranks of advanced teams. (Attached picture)

    榆树县三千多干部到生产队当副队长
    夏锄开始，一部分熟悉农村工作、富有领导经验的干部，深入生产队，改短期包队为长期兼职，进一步加强了夏锄的领导
    新华社长春讯　中共吉林省榆树县委在夏锄生产中组织大批县、社、管理区级干部深入生产第一线兼任生产队副队长，增强了基层单位的领导力量，促使夏锄生产进度快质量好。今年全县每遍地的铲趟时间由往年的十三天缩短为八天左右。目前，全县各种禾苗生长良好，二三类苗很少。
    中共榆树县委在春耕生产期间，就组织了八千五百多名县、社、区级干部和广大社员群众结合，进行田间大会战，促使春耕生产又快又好的提前完成。夏锄开始，县委又从总结春耕生产入手，对今年夏锄生产任务重，田间作业质量要求高，劳力紧张，特别是阴雨天多所造成的地荒费工等特点进行了全面分析。决定进一步的加强基层领导，除继续坚持干部与群众举行田间会战的领导方法外，还将一部分熟悉农村工作，富有领导经验的干部由短期包队，流动会战的工作方式，发展为长期固定，兼职包队的领导方法，进一步加强了夏锄领导力量。现在，全县有三千多名县、社、区干部到生产队兼做副队长。
    这些干部兼任生产队副队长以后，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，找关键攻关键。城发公社城发管理区支部副书记王荣，到该区的第一生产队兼作副队长后，发现社员不愿使用改良工具，铲趟迟缓。经他了解是耘锄不好使。他便找木匠和扶犁手共同研究，反复改制，结果改制成一台铲趟两用的中耕除草工具，工效比人工锄草高八倍。公社党委立即在这个生产队召开了现场会议，并将全公社的三百八十二台耘锄全部改制。使全公社的旱田铲趟由十三天一遍，缩短到五天一遍。城发公社的干部、木匠、扶犁手三结合的改制、使用新工具的经验推广后，促进全县改制和使用三铧除草机、五齿耘锄、夹犁等共七千多件，使铲趟日进度比原来提高61％。
    由于这些干部富有生产经验，又有领导能力，他们到各个生产队后就很快的帮助生产队长提高了领导水平。新庄公社生产队长何学方劳动很好，但领导水平低，光知道带头苦干，不会安排生产和合理组织劳力，使生产中经常出现窝工，劳动效率不高。兼职副队长刘军发现以后，就在实际工作中教给何学方怎样安排活计，制定小段作业计划，使何学方学会了一整套组织生产和领导生产的方法。他在夏锄中根据参加生产的男女社员体力强弱，技术高低，地远地近，地荒地净等特点，分配带孩子的妇女和老弱辅助劳力铲近地、净地；体力强，技术高的社员铲远地荒地，因而，使全队的劳动效率提高20％。
    这些兼职副队长还帮助生产队长组织和安排社员生活。泗河公社有七十二个食堂，经过兼职副队长的帮助，使食堂作到了饭菜多样化，同时又解决了部分食堂缺桌少凳的问题，使社员吃的饱、吃的好，吸引更多的社员参加了公共食堂，腾出二千五百四十多名劳力和辅助劳力参加夏锄生产。
    中共榆树县委在组织干部到生产队兼任副队长时，还特别注意了加强对后进地区的领导，将大批公社党委委员，管理区支部书记派到后进生产队，使绝大部分后进生产队改变了面貌。保寿公社东丰管理区第五生产队历年都是一个生产搞不好，打粮少的后进队。今年夏锄开始时，公社党委派党委宣传委员孙宪武，东丰管理区支部副书记侯守堂二人兼任副队长。他们在生产中和队长带头铲地、间苗、追肥，使全队二万一千五百五十亩地全部成为一类苗，被评为全公社的先进生产队。现在全县绝大部分后进队都已改变面貌，并有八十五个后进队跨进先进队的行列。（附图片）
