　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Belgian government outrageously dispatched paratrooper units on the 10th, landing in Élisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, and Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province, in the newly independent Congo, to armedly suppress the Congolese people who were opposing colonialism and holding patriotic demonstrations.

　　Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba strongly protested this Belgian military invasion of Congolese territory. He said, "We are willing to warn anyone who attempts to occupy our territory with troops," "We will defend our country to the very end." Lumumba said that the Congolese government would not tolerate the destruction of Congo's national independence.

　　At the same time, Congolese soldiers have launched an armed struggle with the Belgian colonial army. According to reports, Congolese troops from Jadotville and Hekovici in Katanga Province are advancing south towards Élisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province. In Élisabethville, Congolese soldiers are fighting the 300 Belgian paratroopers who are armedly suppressing them. In Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province, angry Congolese soldiers have surrounded about a thousand colonialists. In the Matadi region of Lower Congo, Congolese soldiers have also surrounded colonialists.

　　According to a report from Brussels: Currently, Belgium has three paratrooper companies and nine infantry companies participating in suppression activities in the Congo. Belgian Defense Minister Gilson openly claimed that Belgian troops would invade fourteen locations in the Congo under the pretext of "protecting" colonialists.

　　According to reports, the United States is currently preparing to participate in interfering in Congo's internal affairs. An Associated Press reporter in Léopoldville promoted United Nations intervention in the Congo in a dispatch on the 10th. The dispatch also revealed that the US Ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, held a secret meeting with UN Under-Secretary-General Bunch (an American) on the evening of the 10th to discuss the situation in the Congo.

　　At the same time, news has revealed that Britain is also preparing to intervene.

　　比利时增派军队血腥镇压刚果人民
　　刚果展开保卫祖国斗争
　　卢蒙巴总理说：我们将保卫我们国家直到最后
    本报讯　据新华社消息：比利时政府悍然在10日派遣伞兵部队，降落在新独立的刚果加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔和开赛省首府路路阿堡等地，武装镇压反对殖民主义、举行爱国示威的刚果人民。
    刚果总理卢蒙巴对比利时军队这次侵犯刚果国土提出强烈抗议。他说，“我们愿意警告任何企图用军队占领我国领土的人”，“我们将保卫我们的国家直到最后。”卢蒙巴说，刚果政府不会容忍刚果的民族独立受到破坏。
    同时，刚果士兵已和比利时殖民军展开了武装斗争。据报道，来自刚果加丹加省的贾多特维尔和赫科维西的刚果军队正在向南挺进，开往加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔。在伊利沙伯维尔，刚果士兵正在同武装镇压他们的比利时三百名伞兵进行战斗。在开赛省首府路路阿堡，愤怒的刚果士兵包围了约一千个殖民主义者。在下刚果的马塔迪地区，刚果士兵也包围了殖民主义者。
    据布鲁塞尔消息：目前，比利时已经有三个伞兵连和九个步兵连在刚果参与镇压活动。比利时国防大臣纪耳松公然声称，比利时军队将以“保护”殖民者为借口侵入刚果十四个地方。
    据消息说，美国目前正在准备参与干涉刚果内政。美联社驻利奥波德维尔记者10日在一条消息里宣传由联合国出面干涉刚果。这条消息还透露，美国驻刚果大使廷泊累克10日傍晚同联合国副秘书长本奇（美国人）就刚果局势举行了秘密会谈。
    同时，有消息透露，英国也在准备插手干涉。
