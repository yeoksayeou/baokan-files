The Sorrow of the "Plague God"
Qian Junrui (lyrics) Huang Yongyu (woodcut)

    Unable to go, Japan
        (Remembering Qin E) Heart filled with terror, the "Plague God" desperately seeks foolproof plans. Foolproof plans: straight up in an iron bird, with plastic walls. The raging waves flood the palace, turned away at the door, unable to go. Unable to go! How to clean up the mess of this Western breeze?!
    Our Army Greets and Sends Off with Angry Cannons
        (Remembering Qin E) Cannon fire urgent. The benevolent don't come, but a turtle does. A turtle comes, a fierce demon, go to hell! The "Plague God" is angry but powerless, repeatedly saying, "Regret" "Will take responsibility." Take responsibility? Destroying the old and rotten is our heavenly duty.
    Returning in Disappointment
        (Tune: A Song of Silk-washing Stream) Difficult to calm the frightened soul, unbearable to look back at the layers of barriers. "Mobs" "Violence" chills my heart. The noose tightens with each turn. False benevolence and righteousness are thoroughly seen through. The "Plague God" scurries away like a rat, and the people rejoice.

    “瘟神”的悲哀
    钱俊瑞词  黄永玉木刻
    去不得也，日本
        （忆秦娥）胆惊裂，“瘟神”苦索万全策。万全策：直升铁鸟，塑料车壁。怒涛汹涌漫宫阙，闭门羹里去不得。去不得！西风残局，怎生收拾？！
    我军怒炮迎送
        （忆秦娥）炮声急。善者不来来个鳖。来个鳖，凶神恶煞，去你妈的！“瘟神”有气但无力，连声：“遗憾”“要负责”。要负责？摧枯拉朽，是咱天职。
    败兴而归
        （浣溪沙）欲定惊魂难上难，不堪回首万重关。“暴民”“暴力”我心寒。绞索条条使劲勒。假仁假义尽看穿。“瘟神”鼠窜万民欢。
