Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Jiangsu is seizing the season and time, rushing to complete the final stages of summer planting, further expanding the planting area of rice and crops such as corn, sorghum, and sweet potatoes, and making every effort to plant all land capable of growing grain with summer crops, striving for more planting and more harvesting.

This year, the summer crop area in various parts of Jiangsu has expanded compared to last year. At present, except for the Xuhuai area, the transplanting of medium rice has been completed in other areas, and late rice areas are rushing to complete the final stages. In areas with large medium and late rice areas along both sides of the Yangtze River, cadres and the masses have been mobilized to carry out seedling inspection and replanting movements, planting rice in all fields, corners, and seedling fields. In some places where seedlings are insufficient, direct seeding methods have been adopted to replenish and expand the area of medium and late rice. Changshu County, on the basis of completing the medium rice planting task, put forward the slogan "Plant the fields to the edge." Cadres at all levels went deep into the fields to lead commune members in inspecting seedlings and replanting. After five days of concentrated effort, the county replanted a total of 115,000 mu of medium rice and planted 9,700 mu of scattered rice in field corners, banks, low-lying ponds, and ash bins. In Wujiang County, six communes, including Zhenze, Meiyan, and Qingyun, used methods such as checking seedlings and replanting to expand the planting of late rice by more than 2,300 mu. The Xuhuai area in northern Jiangsu is now seizing the opportunity after the rain to rush to complete the medium rice planting task. Each commune in Lianshui County dispatched 100,000 people, forming specialized teams for land preparation, seedling pulling, seedling transportation, rice planting, and irrigation, and on the 26th, they transplanted more than 35,000 mu of medium rice, with a daily progress more than twice as fast as in the past.

While expanding the area of ​​medium and late rice, many areas have adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, using "ten-edge" gap intercropping and interplanting to actively expand the planting area of ​​dry crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and sorghum. Dongtai County put forward the slogan "Planting one mu is one mu, planting one fen is one fen." After completing the summer planting task, it organized more than 50,000 people to use "ten-edge" land corners to expand the planting of soybeans, corn, carrots, adzuki beans, minor grains, and vegetables by more than 60,000 mu. Huaiyin City adopted methods such as scattering corn in spring peanut, soybean, and sugar beet fields, widely planting corn along the edges of fields, roads, and ditches, and mobilizing commune members to plant 100 corn plants per household, increasing corn planting in the city by more than 100,000 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. Guangdong is seizing the opportunity before the busy summer harvest to continue to actively expand the planting of coarse grain crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, and beans. From May to now, the province has planted about three million mu.

Guangdong Province is uniquely endowed with the ability to plant coarse grains in all four seasons. Various localities are making full use of this favorable condition, trying every possible means to tap the potential of the land, and continuing to expand the planting area of ​​various summer-sown coarse grains before the busy summer harvest. Shunde County, where land is precious, has now planted more than 35,000 mu of sweet potatoes, sorghum, corn, and so on. In addition to continuing intercropping, interplanting, and making full use of scattered land, they also planted sweet potatoes and tomatoes along the water's edge, and drought-resistant sorghum, corn, beans, and pumpkins on the top of pond dikes and large embankments, based on the characteristics of the county's many fish ponds, river channels, and dikes.

Leaders taking the lead and cadres taking the lead are an important guarantee for expanding the summer planting of coarse grains. All thirteen Party committee secretaries and 308 commune and brigade cadres of Shigou Commune in Guangsi County went deep into the grassroots level, led commune members in a week-long blitz, and reclaimed wasteland and used scattered land to plant 15,000 mu of sweet potatoes. Due to the importance attached by the leadership in the Hainan area, they have recently taken advantage of the favorable opportunity of moderate or heavy rain throughout the island to mobilize the masses to rush to plant, and have also achieved great results.

At present, although various parts of Guangdong are in the busy period of the summer harvest and preparation for late rice planting, the mass movement to expand the planting of coarse grain crops is still continuing. Shantou, Foshan, and other areas that were hit by typhoons and rainstorms in mid-June have even greater enthusiasm for expanding planting. In the past ten days, the Shantou area has planted about 100,000 mu of coarse grain crops and vegetables. Huizhou County in the Foshan Prefecture has established specialized leadership organizations for expanding the planting of coarse grain crops from the county to the brigade level, specifically solving the problems of land, labor, and seeds in the continued expansion of planting.

    抓季节抢时间扩大夏种面积
    江苏田头田角增种中晚稻　广东利用零星地大种杂粮
    据新华社南京讯　江苏各地抓季节、抢时间，突击夏种扫尾，进一步扩大水稻和玉米、高粱、山芋等作物的种植面积，千方百计把所有能够种植粮食的土地，都种上夏种作物，争取多种多收。
    今年，江苏各地夏种作物面积比去年扩大。目前，除徐淮地区外，其他各地的中稻已栽插结束，晚稻地区正在突击扫尾。中稻晚稻面积较大的长江两岸地区，都发动干部群众开展查苗补棵运动，把所有的田头、田角、秧田都种上稻子。有些秧苗不足的地方，采取了直播办法，补足和扩大中稻晚稻面积。常熟县在完成中稻栽插任务的基础上，提出“种田种到边”的口号，各级干部深入田头，领导社员查苗补插，经过五天突击，全县共查补中稻十一万五千多亩，补种田角、岸边、低潭、灰仓等零星水稻九千七百多亩。吴江县震泽、梅堰、青云等六个公社用查苗补棵等办法，扩种晚稻两千三百多亩。江苏北部的徐淮地区，现在都抓紧雨后时机突击完成中稻栽插任务。涟水县各公社出动十万人，分别组成整地、拔秧、运秧、插秧、灌水等专业队，26日一天就栽插中稻三万五千多亩，日进度比过去加快了两倍多。
    在扩大中稻晚稻面积的同时，许多地区都采取开垦荒地、利用“十边”隙地间作套种等办法，积极扩大玉米、山芋、高粱等旱作物的种植面积。东台县提出“多种一亩是一亩，多种一分是一分”的口号，在完成夏种任务后，又组织五万多人，利用“十边”地角，扩种黄豆、玉米、胡萝卜、赤豆、小杂粮和蔬菜等六万多亩。淮阴市采取在春茬花生、大豆和甜菜田中间散种玉米，利用场边、路边、沟边广泛种植玉米和发动社员每户栽百棵玉米等办法，全市共增种玉米十万多亩。
    新华社广州讯　广东各地正在抓紧夏收大忙之前的时机，继续积极扩种番薯、玉米、高粱、豆类等杂粮作物。从5月到现在，全省已经种了三百万亩左右。
    广东省得天独厚，四季可种杂粮。各地充分利用这个有利条件，千方百计挖掘土地潜力，在夏收大忙之前继续扩大各种夏种杂粮的种植面积。尺土寸金的顺德县，现已种下番薯、高粱、玉米等三万五千多亩。他们除了继续套种、间种和充分利用零星土地外，还根据本县渔塘、河涌、堤围多的特点，沿水边种植番薯、番茄，在塘基顶和大围顶种植耐旱的高粱、玉米、豆类和南瓜等。
    领导上阵、干部带头，是扩大夏种杂粮面积的重要保证。广四县石狗公社十三个党委书记和三百零八个公社、大队干部，全部深入基层，领导社员突击一周，就开荒和利用零星土地种下番薯一万五千亩。海南地区由于领导重视，近来趁全岛普遍下了中雨或大雨的有利时机，发动群众抢种，也取得很大成绩。
    目前，广东各地虽然处在夏收和晚造备耕大忙期间，扩种杂粮作物的群众运动仍在继续开展。6月中旬遭受台风、暴雨袭击的汕头、佛山等地区，扩种的积极性更高。汕头地区近十天来已种下杂粮作物和蔬菜十万亩左右。佛山专区惠阳县从县到大队，层层成立了扩种杂粮作物的专门领导机构，具体解决继续扩种中的土地、劳力和种苗问题。
