Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 29th: Responding to the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to hold a "Congo Day" (July 30th), the Vietnam Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee held a rally tonight to support the just struggle of the Congolese people.

    The rally passed a resolution warmly supporting the heroic struggle of the Congolese people; strongly opposing the aggression of the Belgian colonialists and the U.S.-led imperialism against the Congo, and demanding the withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo.

    Attending the rally were Ton Quang Phiet, Chairman of the Vietnam Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee, Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and representatives from various political parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life.

    Vu Linh, a member of the Vietnam Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee, said at the meeting that the struggle of the Congolese people reflects their will to achieve genuine independence. He said, "The Vietnamese people, who have waged a long struggle against imperialist aggression to win and defend national independence and are resolutely opposing U.S. imperialist aggression against South Vietnam, fully sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Congolese people to defend national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."

    He said that the Vietnamese people strongly oppose the blatant aggression against the Congo by Belgium and the U.S.-led imperialist bloc, and their conspiracy to re-establish colonial rule in the Congo. Vu Linh pointed out that the "United Nations forces," manipulated by U.S. imperialism, are not being used to stop Belgian aggression and restore the sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo. On the contrary, they are being used to oppose the Congolese army, which is defending its independence and freedom.

    Vu Linh also said that U.S. imperialism, using "aid" and "cooperation" as bait, is trying to replace the Belgian colonialists in plundering the Congo's resources and oppressing and exploiting the Congolese people.

    Vu Linh emphasized that the facts once again prove that U.S. imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the Congolese people, the African people, and the people of the world.

    Vu Linh pointed out that Africa is awakening. The imperialists clinging to Africa are sitting on a volcano. The oppressed nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America are rising up one after another to bury colonialism and fight for independence. He said that no force can stop their advance.

    Vu Linh expressed his belief that with the support and sympathy of the socialist camp and the people of the world, the Congolese people, as long as they unite closely, are vigilant against imperialist conspiracies, and resolutely smash imperialist aggression and interference, will surely achieve final victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 29th: "Friendship" newspaper said on the 28th that the Belgian colonial troops must withdraw from the Congo and stop interfering in the Congo's internal affairs. The newspaper said that the independence and neutrality of the Congo is an important factor in defending the peace of the world and Africa. The newspaper pointed out that the attitude of Western countries towards the so-called "independence" of Katanga province is actually fueling the arrogance of Belgian colonialism.

    河内集会支持刚果人民英勇斗争
    通过决议谴责美比帝国主义的侵略行为
    新华社河内29日电　响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“刚果日”（7月30日）的号召，越南亚非人民团结委员会今天晚上举行集会，支持刚果人民的正义斗争。
    集会通过决议，热烈支持刚果人民的英勇斗争；强烈反对比利时殖民主义和以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果的侵略，并要求比利时侵略军撤出刚果。
    参加这个集会的有越南亚非人民团结委员会主席孙光阀、越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎庭探和各政党、团体以及各阶层人民的代表。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会委员武灵在会上发表讲话说，刚果人民的斗争反映了刚果人民要求真正独立的意志。他说，“曾经为争取和保卫民族独立而长期进行反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，并正在坚决反对美帝国主义对越南南方的侵略的越南人民，完全同情和支持刚果人民保卫民族独立、主权和领土完整的正义斗争。”
    他说，越南人民强烈反对比利时和以美国为首的帝国主义集团露骨地侵略刚果、阴谋重新在刚果——建立殖民主义的统治。武灵指出，由美帝国主义操纵的“联合国军”，不是用来制止比利时的侵略，恢复刚果共和国的主权，相反地，是用来反对正在保卫自己的独立和自由的刚果军队。
    武灵还说，美帝国主义以“援助”和“合作”为钓饵，企图取代比利时殖民者的地位，来搜刮刚果的资源，压迫和剥削刚果人民。
    武灵强调说，事实再一次证明，美帝国主义是刚果人民、非洲人民和全世界人民的最危险的敌人。
    武灵指出，非洲正在觉醒。赖在非洲的帝国主义正坐在火山头上。非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲被压迫的各民族正在相继站起来为埋葬殖民主义、争取独立而斗争。他说，任何力量都不能阻挠他们的前进。
    武灵表示相信，在社会主义阵营和全世界人民的支持和同情下，刚果人民只要紧密地团结起来，警惕帝国主义的阴谋，坚决粉碎帝国主义的侵略和干涉，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    新华社金边29日电　“友谊报”28日说，比利时殖民军队必须撤出刚果，并停止干涉刚果的内政。这家报纸说，刚果的独立和中立在保卫世界和非洲的和平方面是一个重要的因素。这家报纸指出，西方国家对所谓加丹加省“独立”的态度实际上是助长比利时殖民主义的气焰。
