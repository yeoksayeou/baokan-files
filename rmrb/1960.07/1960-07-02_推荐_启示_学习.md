    Recommendation · Enlightenment · Learning
    Mei Yuan
    We recommend to our readers Comrade Xun Cunzhu's article and ask that all readers read it carefully. Comrade Xun Cunzhu is an ordinary farmer, currently the director of a public canteen, whose educational level has only just allowed him to shed the label of being illiterate and is currently studying in a spare-time senior primary class. However, this farmer, who has only been literate for a short time, has studied Chairman Mao's works so well and used them so wonderfully. From this, we can gain an enlightenment: as long as you have a certain level of education and practical, perceptual knowledge, and as long as you study earnestly and diligently, you can learn theory well and grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought.
    Studying theory, studying Chairman Mao's works, cannot tolerate the slightest falsehood; only persistence and diligent study will do. As the Party Branch Secretary said, "Learning requires hard work; don't be afraid of not understanding; just study with your heart." Hasn't Comrade Xun Cunzhu, after studying with his heart, figured out something significant? Chairman Mao's works were written in the mass revolutionary movement and are fundamentally different from the armchair theorizing of bourgeois scholars who are divorced from reality. Theory extracted and summarized from the practical reality of mass revolution is intimate to comrades engaged in practical work, and they can even better grasp and apply revolutionary theory than intellectuals confined to their studies. Comrade Xun Cunzhu is a proof of this. In the past, the working class and peasants were considered the most ignorant in the eyes of the exploiting classes. However, in the era of Mao Zedong, it is not only an era of great political and economic transformation for the working class and peasants, but also an era of great cultural transformation. All those who were considered the most ignorant by the exploiting classes of the old era are the most intelligent and capable people.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all our work. By studying Chairman Mao's works, we will not lose our way, and we will have the confidence to overcome difficulties and move forward continuously. By studying Chairman Mao's works, we will also have ways to promote all our work. As Comrade Xun Cunzhu said, "As long as we study Chairman Mao's works well and listen to Chairman Mao, we will be clever and skillful, full of energy, and have eyes everywhere, and no difficulty can stop us from moving forward!" Mao Zedong Thought is the source of victory for all our work.
    Dear readers, let us all be like Comrade Xun Cunzhu, earnestly and diligently read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao, and hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in all our work!

    推荐·启示·学习
    梅原
    我们向读者推荐寻存珠同志写的这篇文章，请读者们都来认真地读一读它。寻存珠同志是一个普通农民，现在是一个公共食堂的事务长，他的文化程度只不过刚刚摘掉文盲帽子，眼下正在业余高小班学习。然而这位识字还不久的农民，却把毛主席著作学得这样好，用得那样妙。从这里，我们可以得到一个启示：只要你有了一定的文化程度，又有实践的感性知识，只要你是认真地刻苦地学习的，就能学好理论，掌握和运用毛泽东思想。
    学习理论，学习毛主席著作，来不得半点虚假，唯有持之以恒、刻苦钻研。正如那位党支部书记所说：“学习要下苦工夫，不要怕不懂，只要用心钻就行”。寻存珠同志不是在用心钻后就钻出了个名堂来了吗？毛主席著作是在群众革命运动中写出来的，根本不同于资产阶级学者脱离实际、关在书斋里的空谈。从群众革命实际中提炼、总结出来的理论，对于从事着实际工作的同志，都是亲切的，他们甚至可以比关在书斋里的知识分子，能更好地掌握并且运用革命理论，寻存珠同志就是一个证明。工农群众过去在剥削阶级的眼中是最愚昧的，然而，我们在毛泽东的时代里，不仅是工农群众政治上经济上大翻身的时代，而且是文化大翻身的时代。一切被旧时代的剥削阶级认为最愚昧的人，却是最聪明最能干的人。
    毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指路明灯。学了毛主席著作，我们就不会迷失方向，就有克服困难、不断前进的信心；学了毛主席著作，我们对推动一切工作也就有了办法。正如寻存珠同志所说：“只要好好学习毛主席的著作，听毛主席的话，我们就能心灵手巧，浑身是劲，满脑是眼，什么困难也挡不住我们前进！”毛泽东思想是我们一切工作胜利的源泉。
    读者同志们，让我们都像寻存珠同志一样，认真地刻苦地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，在我们的一切工作中高高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗吧！
