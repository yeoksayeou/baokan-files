    Holding High the Red Flag and Singing the Praises of Socialism's Victory
    ——A Review of the Film "Oasis Triumph"
    Yi Bing
      "Oasis Triumph" is a color feature film jointly produced by the Shanghai Haiyan Film Studio and the Xinjiang Film Studio, reflecting the life and struggle of the Uygur people in Xinjiang during the period of socialist construction. It was one of the films presented last year in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    Through the development story of an agricultural cooperative in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the film truthfully and vividly reflects the firm adherence of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to the socialist road under the leadership of the Party, and the sharp and complex class struggle they waged to defend the cooperative movement and against capitalist ideas and the remnant forces of landlords and counter-revolutionaries in the countryside. In the film, the poor and lower-middle peasants, represented by the protagonists Balati and Ayimuhan, resolutely wanted to take the path of collectivization; while several well-to-do middle peasants were selling grain, engaging in speculative business, and wanted to take the capitalist road. Nuerding, the son of the well-to-do middle peasant Tuohudi, even instigated some backward masses, under the instigation of landlords and counter-revolutionary elements, to create disturbances and withdraw from the cooperative. However, under the strong leadership of the Party, represented by cooperative director Balati, relying closely on the basic masses, and conducting class education, the counter-revolutionary elements' conspiracy was finally crushed, the class consciousness of the masses was raised, and the cooperative was consolidated. The broad masses of peasants advanced from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives with full confidence. The events reflected in the film powerfully illustrate that class struggle does not disappear with the destruction of the economic base of hostile classes; on the contrary, with the deepening of the revolution, this struggle becomes more profound and complex, and the will and enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to take the socialist road cannot be hindered by any reactionary or backward forces. The playwright closely combined this theme, which is rich in practical educational significance, with the personal experiences of the protagonist Ayimuhan, so that the thoughts, qualities, personality, image, and mutual relationships of each character are directly and indirectly expressed from the struggle between the two roads, thereby more clearly highlighting the theme and possessing strong artistic appeal.
    The film brilliantly portrays Ayimuhan and Balati, two vivid and typical advanced figures. Production team leader Ayimuhan is the daughter of an old farmhand from a hired peasant family. She is kind, gentle, loves labor, and is married to Nuerding, the son of a well-to-do middle peasant. Because she constantly struggles with her husband, who is wholeheartedly determined to take the capitalist road, Nuerding's family regards her as a thorn in their side and makes things difficult for her in every possible way. The playwright enthusiastically describes how this kind daughter of the working people, under the guidance of the Party and in the crucible of class struggle, transforms from weakly complaining about her fate to completely taking control of her own destiny, becoming a strong fighter defending the socialist cause. In the "oath" scene, when Maimu Han (Ayimuhan's sister-in-law), who opposes the cooperative, fabricates a story in front of Nuerding that Ayimuhan has an improper relationship with cooperative director Balati (Ayimuhan's lover before marriage), leading Nuerding to beat Ayimuhan and demand that she swear an oath on the Quran, we see Ayimuhan kneeling on the carpet, holding the Quran, sobbing, and finally falling on the Quran, crying bitterly. That painful and complex expression profoundly portrays Ayimuhan's love for the cooperative, her longing for a happy life, but her inability to completely resist feudal ethics and traditional religious constraints, and her painful and complex emotions in resolutely fighting against Nuerding. However, in the "protecting the granary" scene, we can see that when Nuerding leads the troublemaking masses to the granary door to loot grain, Ayimuhan steps forward, spreads her arms, protects the warehouse door, and bravely confronts Nuerding, saying: "You can beat me to death, but you can't rob the warehouse." This fully demonstrates that Ayimuhan has realized that the cooperative cause is more important than her own personal happiness, so she dares to wage a life-and-death struggle with her husband who is undermining the cooperative. This vividly demonstrates that she has grown up in the struggle, and forms a stark contrast with the previous "oath" scene.
    Communist Party member Balati gives us the distinct impression of being honest, steadfast, loyal to the Party's cause, firmly implementing the Party's class policy in the countryside, and maintaining a high degree of vigilance against class enemies. He resolutely stands at the forefront of opposing the capitalist road in order to realize collectivization. The author gives him a meticulous portrayal in the "disturbing the cooperative" scene. When some backward masses are incited by bad elements to go to the cooperative to take livestock and rob grain, we see him riding his horse from the district to stop the troublemaking members, shouting: "Stop!" Then, he sincerely enlightens the masses' class consciousness, causing some of the backward masses who are making trouble to be awed by the truth and lower their heads in silence. Then, we hear him say loudly: "Those who want to go back to the old road, let them go. Those who are willing to follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao, and follow the cooperative, come with me." After speaking, he raises the red flag high and strides forward. The members immediately formed a mighty contingent behind Balati, advancing toward the road leading to the cooperative. The depiction of this scene is very successful, allowing us to vividly see the power of the Party's leadership represented by Balati, and how the Communist Party members unswervingly hold high the Party's red flag in the countryside, leading the masses to advance from struggle.
    The entire film is rich in local and ethnic characteristics and a novel artistic style. The film creators have consistently used a balance of tenderness and strength in their artistic treatment, and are healthy and smooth, using a lyrical style throughout the film. The tall poplar trees, the orchards with blooming flowers, the fertile oasis, and the camel herds on the boundless desert all have a strong national flavor and atmosphere of life.
    The Xinjiang Uygur actors who participated in the creation of this film were all performing under the mercury lamps for the first time, but the characters they created were so vivid and realistic. Actors such as Ayimuxia, who plays Ayimuhan, and Silajiding, who plays Balati, have grasped the identity and personality of the characters appropriately, and their acting skills are also very proficient. The actress who plays Maimuhan can be said to have fully expressed the image of a backward-thinking, gossiping woman, leaving a deep impression on the audience. This shows that our national art team is constantly growing and developing under the leadership of the Party.

    高举红旗歌颂社会主义的胜利
    ——评影片“绿洲凯歌”
    艺兵
      “绿洲凯歌”是上海海燕电影制片厂和新疆电影制片厂联合摄制的一部反映在社会主义建设时期新疆维吾尔族人民的生活和斗争的彩色艺术片。它是去年向建国十周年献礼影片中的一部。
    影片通过新疆维吾尔自治区的一个农业合作社的发展故事，真实地、生动地反映了广大贫农和下中农在党的领导下，坚决走社会主义道路，为捍卫合作化事业、向农村中的资本主义思想和地主反革命残余势力展开的一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。影片中以主人翁巴拉提和阿依木罕为代表的贫农和下中农，坚决要走合作化道路；而几个富裕中农，却贩卖粮食，做投机生意，想走资本主义道路。富裕中农托乎地的儿子奴尔丁竟在地主和反革命分子的怂恿下，煽动一部分落后群众，制造闹社、退社纠纷。但在以社主任巴拉提为代表的党的坚强领导下，紧紧依靠基本群众，进行阶级教育，终于粉碎了反革命分子的阴谋，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，巩固了合作社，广大农民满怀信心地由初级社向高级社前进。影片所反映的事件，有力地说明了：阶级斗争并不因敌对阶级的经济基础被摧毁而消失；相反地，随着革命的深入发展，这个斗争变得更为深刻、更为复杂了，而新疆各族人民走社会主义道路的意志和热情是任何反动、落后势力所阻挠不了的。剧作者把这个富有现实教育意义的主题和主人翁阿依木罕的个人遭遇紧紧地结合在一起，使每一个人物的思想、品质、性格、形象和相互关系都直接、间接地从进行两条道路的斗争中表现出来，从而更加鲜明地突出了主题，并且富有强烈的艺术感染力。
    影片出色地塑造了阿依木罕和巴拉提这两个生动而又具有典型意义的先进人物。生产队长阿依木罕，是雇农出身的老饲养员的女儿，她善良温和，热爱劳动，嫁给了富裕中农的儿子奴尔丁。由于她不断地和一心一意要走资本主义道路的丈夫进行斗争，因此，奴尔丁一家人把她看作眼中钉，百般刁难她。剧作者满怀热情地描写了这个善良的劳动人民的女儿在党的教导下，在阶级斗争的熔炉里，如何从懦弱地埋怨自己的命运到完全掌握自己的命运，成为一个保卫社会主义事业的坚强战士。在“宣誓”的那一场戏里，当反对合作社的麦来木罕（阿依木罕的嫂嫂）在奴尔丁面前捏造阿依木罕与社主任巴拉提（阿依木罕婚前的情人）有着不正当的关系，以至奴尔丁毒打阿依木罕，要她对经宣誓时，我们看见阿依木罕跪在地毡上，手抱经书，泣不成声，终于倒在经书上痛哭流涕。那种痛苦和复杂的表情，深刻地刻划了阿依木罕热爱合作社，向往幸福生活，但还不能完全反抗封建礼教和传统的宗教束缚，毅然和奴尔丁进行坚决斗争的痛苦而复杂的感情。但在“护仓”的那一场戏里，我们可以看到当奴尔丁领着闹事的群众来到粮仓门前抢粮时，阿依木罕挺身而出，她展开双臂，护着库房大门，勇敢地与奴尔丁交锋，说：“你打死我好了，想抢库房办不到。”这里充分表现阿依木罕已经觉悟到合作化事业比自己个人幸福更重要，因此她敢于与破坏合作化的丈夫展开生死斗争，这里生动地表现了她在斗争中成长起来了，与前面“宣誓”的那一场成了鲜明的对比。
    共产党员巴拉提，给我们的鲜明印象是：诚实敦厚，忠于党的事业，坚定地贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策，对待阶级敌人保持着高度的警惕，他为实现合作化，坚决地站在反对走资本主义道路的最前列。作者在“闹社”的那一场戏里，对他作了精心的描绘。当部分落后群众被坏分子煽动，到合作社牵牲口、抢粮食时，我们看见他从区里挥马前来，拦住闹事的社员，喝道：“站住！”然后真诚地启发群众的阶级觉悟，使部分闹社的落后群众慑于真理、低头不语。接着，听见他大声地说：“那些愿意回到老路上去的人，就让他们去吧，愿意跟着共产党、跟着毛主席、跟着合作社走的人，就跟我来。”说完，高举红旗，迈开大步向前去。社员们立刻在巴拉提身后汇成了一个声势浩大的队伍，向通往合作社的大道前进。这一场戏的描写是十分成功的，使我们形象地看到以巴拉提为代表的党的领导的威力，看到了共产党员如何在农村中坚定不移地高举党的红旗、领导群众从斗争中前进。
    整个影片富有地方和民族特色以及新颖的艺术风格。影片创作者在艺术处理上始终是有柔有刚，健康、流畅，用抒情的格调贯穿全片。画面中那高挺的白杨树，鲜花盛放的果园，肥沃的绿洲和一望无垠的沙洲上的驼群，都带有浓郁的民族色彩和生活气息。
    参加这部影片创作的新疆维吾尔族的演员们，都是第一次在水银灯下表演，但他们所塑造的人物形象，却是那样鲜明而富有真实感。像饰演阿衣木罕的演员阿衣木夏和饰演巴拉提的演员斯拉基丁，对人物的身份、性格都掌握得恰如其分，演技也很熟练。饰演麦来木罕的演员可以说是淋漓尽致地表现了一个思想落后的长舌妇的形象，给人留下深刻的印象。这说明了我们民族艺术队伍在党的领导下正在不断地成长和壮大。
