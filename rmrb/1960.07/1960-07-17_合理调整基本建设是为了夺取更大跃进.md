　　Rational Adjustment of Basic Construction to Seize a Greater Leap Forward
　　Undertaking basic construction is to increase production capacity and develop social productive forces. However, the production of material wealth always relies on current production enterprises and production units. The more production develops, the larger the scale of basic construction and the higher the construction standards will be. This is one aspect of the mutual promotion between basic construction and current production. However, there is also a mutually restrictive aspect between the two, and contradictions may occur if not handled properly. In order to closely integrate basic construction and current production, basic construction must not only arrange key projects that require long-term construction and have a significant impact on the development of the national economy; at the same time, it must also ensure that basic construction does not affect current production in terms of using materials, labor, and transportation capacity. That is to say, the current and long-term interests of the people must be well integrated. In this way, the mutually promoting effect of basic construction and current production will be significantly brought into play. If the arrangements are improper, and the scale of basic construction is excessively large, exceeding the scope of what can be achieved, it will inevitably affect current production and harm current interests, and the basic construction plan will be impossible to realize, and long-term interests will become empty talk. Therefore, we must constantly adjust the proportional relationship between basic construction and current production according to the development of the objective situation, and give full play to the mutually promoting effect of basic construction and current production. The most central link here is not to stretch the basic construction front too long. Whether it is basic construction in industry or agriculture, it must not affect the current year's production, and it must promote a great leap forward in the current year's production.
　　Our emphasis on shortening the basic construction front also has a more significant practical meaning. At present, the major task of the entire Party and the entire people is to first ensure the rapid development of agricultural production. All walks of life must do everything possible to support agriculture, strengthen the agricultural front, and lay a solid foundation for the stable and comprehensive leap forward of agricultural production in the future. Under this circumstance, if the basic construction front is too long and the scale is too large, it will inevitably affect greater support for agriculture. It will inevitably occupy more labor from agriculture. This is unfavorable to the development of agricultural production, and it is also unfavorable to the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy. It can be seen from this that shortening the basic construction front is precisely to ensure a more comprehensive leap forward of agriculture and industry in proportion. Shortening the front requires ensuring key points. At present, it is necessary to prioritize water conservancy construction projects that benefit agricultural production as soon as possible, other construction projects that have a significant impact on accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, key industrial construction projects determined by the state, and key basic construction projects in other areas.

### 合理调整基本建设是为了夺取更大跃进

　　合理调整基本建设是为了夺取更大跃进
    进行基本建设是为了增加生产能力，发展社会生产力。但是，生产物质财富总是依靠当前的生产企业和生产单位。生产越发展，基本建设的规模就会越来越大，建设标准也会越来越高，这是基本建设和当年生产相互促进的一面。但是，两者之间也还有相互制约的一面，处理不当，也会发生矛盾。为了使基本建设和当年生产很好地结合起来，进行基本建设，既要注意安排需要长期进行建设、对国民经济的发展有重大作用的重点工程；同时，也还必须使基本建设在使用材料、劳力、运输力量等方面，不影响当年生产。这也就是说，要把人民群众当前利益和长远利益很好地结合起来。这样，基本建设和当年生产相互促进的作用就会明显地发挥出来。如果安排不当，基本建设摊子铺得过大，超过了力所能及的范围，就必然影响当年生产，妨害当前利益，基本建设计划也就无法实现，长远利益就会成为空谈。所以，我们必须经常根据客观形势的发展，合理调整基本建设和当年生产的比例关系，充分发挥基本建设和当年生产相互促进的作用。这里最中心的环节，就是不要把基本建设战线拉得过长。无论工农业的基本建设，都不能影响当年的生产，并且要使基本建设促进当年的生产大跃进。
    我们强调缩短基本建设战线，还有其更重大的现实意义。当前，全党全民的重大任务是首先保证农业生产的迅速发展。各行各业都必须千方百计地支援农业，增强农业战线，为今后农业生产稳定地全面跃进打下巩固的基础。在此情况之下，如果基本建设战线过长，摊子铺得过大，必然影响对农业的更大支援。必然要更多地占用农业方面的劳动力。这对农业生产的发展是不利的，对国民经济全面跃进也是不利的。由此可见，缩短基本建设战线，正是为了保证农业和工业按比例的更全面跃进。缩短战线，要保证重点，在当前就是要优先保证对于农业生产尽早受益的水利建设工程，对于加快农业技术改造有重大作用的其它建设工程，就是要保证国家确定下来的重点工业建设工程，和其它方面的重点基本建设工程。
