Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Iraqi public strongly condemns the Basrah Petroleum Company, operated by US, British, and French capital, for its blatant actions in exerting pressure on Iraq, and has expressed its determination to defend national economic interests.

On July 20, the Basrah Petroleum Company wrote to the Iraqi government, unilaterally deciding to halt production at its Rumaila oil field, while only maintaining production at its Zubair oil field, which averages 3 million tons per year.

According to Baghdad newspapers, the Basrah Company's average annual production in the past was 12 million tons. According to the agreement concluded between the company and the Iraqi government in 1952, the company should produce no less than 8 million tons of oil per year in the Basrah oil fields. However, due to the company's decision to reduce production, only 3 million tons of oil are extracted annually from the Zubair oil field, resulting in a decrease of approximately one-fifth of Iraq's oil revenue.

On July 21, Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim, in a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, accused the Basrah Petroleum Company of "failing to fulfill its obligations and taking unjust actions against Iraq." He warned the company that it would be responsible for the consequences of its reduction in oil production, and that Iraq reserves its rights against the company.

The statement emphasized that the company's actions were taken while it was "using various unfounded excuses to exert pressure on Iraq" and precisely when the Iraqi government had agreed to negotiate with the oil company on August 15 this year to abolish the unjust conditions imposed on Iraq.

In discussing ways to resolve the issue, Qasim stated that Iraq will continue to use peaceful means to reach understanding and achieve negotiations. "We will not stop peaceful negotiations on this issue, and under no circumstances will Iraq take a rash and hostile stance."

An official in charge of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, in a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, revealed that the Basrah Company's decision to reduce production was aimed at "countering the government's measures to increase port fees, and also aimed at imposing its will on the government and exerting pressure on it."

The official recalled the Basrah Petroleum Company's past insistence on paying fixed port fees for exported oil. He pointed out that the agreement forced on the old regime by the company in 1955 stipulated an annual payment of 187,000 dinars as export fees for no more than 8 million tons of oil, and calculated additional oil export fees proportionally.

The official said that after the revolution, the port authority studied the issue of fees levied on exported oil, because they found that the principle of agreeing to collect fixed fees by the previous regime had caused serious damage to the port's revenue. He said that the cabinet had approved the proposal put forward by the port authority at its meeting on May 30 this year. This proposal stipulated an increase in port fees to the equivalent of 280 fils per ton, instead of the previously stipulated amount of only 23 fils per ton.

The official said that the Basrah Petroleum Company refused to accept this, claiming that the port fees were still bound by the 1955 agreement, and used production cuts as a retaliatory measure to exert pressure on the Iraqi government.

The General Federation of Iraqi Trade Unions telegraphed Prime Minister Qasim, supporting the Iraqi government's stance on the Basrah Petroleum Company, operated by US, British, and French capital, and expressed the determination of the Iraqi working class to defend national economic interests.

The telegram condemned the Basrah Petroleum Company's action of reducing oil production as a "violation of the agreement, an act of oppression, procrastination, and fraud," and as "part of a conspiracy to exert pressure on the Iraqi government."

The Iraqi Petroleum Workers Union, the Democratic Youth Federation, the General Federation of Students, and the Women's League also issued statements supporting the government's attitude towards the Basrah Petroleum Company's violation of the agreement.

Many Iraqi newspapers have condemned the Basrah Petroleum Company's unreasonable behavior. The Iraqi "People's Unity" newspaper pointed out on July 22 that the decision of the Basrah Petroleum Company, operated by US, British, and French capital, to stop oil production in the Rumaila oil field, demonstrates how imperialist monopoly companies treat the people of countries whose wealth is plundered by them. It pointed out that this also shows that their aim in taking this action is to exert pressure on the Iraqi government, in order to force this government to submit to their will, greed, and power.

"People's Unity" expressed its support for Qasim's attitude. The newspaper called on the Iraqi government to be more vigilant and firm. At the same time, it is even more necessary for the government to rely on the people and provide opportunities for the people so that they can effectively and seriously express their supportive stance.

### 美英法垄断资本违反协定对伊拉克施加经济压力  伊拉克公众斥外国公司的讹诈行为  支持政府采取的立场　决心保卫国家经济利益

    美英法垄断资本违反协定对伊拉克施加经济压力
    伊拉克公众斥外国公司的讹诈行为
    支持政府采取的立场　决心保卫国家经济利益
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：伊拉克公众强烈谴责美英法等国资本经营的巴士拉石油公司对伊拉克施加压力的蛮横行动，纷纷表示保卫国家经济利益的决心。
    巴士拉石油公司7月20日写信给伊拉克政府，片面决定停止它的鲁迈拉油田的生产，而仅保留它平均年产三百万吨的佐拜尔油田的生产。
    据巴格达报纸报道，巴士拉公司过去的平均年产量为一千二百万吨。根据这家公司同伊拉克政府1952年缔结的协定，这家公司每年在巴士拉油田生产的石油不得少于八百万吨，但由于这家公司采取了减产决定，只开采佐拜尔油田的平均年产三百万吨的石油，这使伊拉克的石油收入大约减少五分之一。
    7月21日，伊拉克总理卡塞姆在向伊拉克通讯社发表的声明中，指责巴士拉石油公司“没有履行义务，并对伊拉克采取了不公正的行动”。他警告这个公司说，它要对它削减石油生产而引起的后果负责，并且伊拉克保留对这个公司的权利。
    声明着重指出，这家公司的这种行动是在它“正以种种毫无根据的借口来对伊拉克施加压力”，并且正当伊拉克政府同意在今年8月15日同石油公司就取消强加于伊拉克的不公正的条件进行谈判时采取的。
    在谈到解决这个问题的办法时，卡塞姆表示，伊拉克将继续用和平的手段来取得谅解和达成谈判。“我们不会停止就这个问题进行和平谈判，并且无论如何，伊拉克也不会采取随便翻脸的态度”。
    伊拉克石油部的负责官员在向伊拉克通讯社发表的谈话中，揭露巴士拉公司决定减产的目的在于“对付政府增加港口费的措施，而且旨在把自己的意志强加于政府并对它施加压力”。
    这位官员追述了巴士拉石油公司过去坚持对出口石油缴纳固定港口费的态度。他指出，公司强使旧政权同它在1955年缔结的协定规定每年交纳十八万七千第纳尔作为不超过八百万吨石油的出口费，并按照同样的比例计算额外的石油出口费。
    这位官员说，在革命以后，港口管理局研究了对出口石油征收的费用问题，因为他们发现，前政权同意征收固定费用的原则给港口的收入带来严重的损害。他说，内阁已经批准了港口管理局在今年5月30日的会议上所提出的建议，这项建议规定增加港口费，使之相当于每吨二百八十费尔，而不是以前规定的只等于每吨二十三费尔的数额。
    这位官员说，但是巴士拉石油公司拒绝接受，声称港口费仍然受1955年的协定的约束，并以减产作为报复措施，对伊拉克政府施加压力。
    伊拉克工会总联合会打电报给卡塞姆总理，支持伊拉克政府对美英法等国资本经营的巴士拉石油公司所采取的立场，并表示伊拉克工人阶级保卫国家经济利益的决心。
    电报谴责巴士拉石油公司削减石油生产的行动是一种“违反协定的、压迫、拖延和欺诈行动”，是对伊拉克政府“施加压力的阴谋的一部分。”
    伊拉克石油工人工会，民主青年联合会，学生总联合会和妇女联盟也都发表声明，支持政府对巴士拉石油公司违反协定所采取的态度。
    伊拉克许多报纸纷纷谴责巴士拉石油公司的无理行为。伊拉克“人民团结报”22日指出，美英法等国资本经营的巴士拉石油公司关于停止在鲁迈拉油田生产石油的决定，说明帝国主义垄断公司如何对待那些财富受到它们掠夺的国家的人民。它指出，这也表明，它们采取这种行动的目的是要对伊拉克政府施加压力，以便迫使这个政府向它们的意志、贪婪和势力屈服。
    “人民团结报”表示支持卡塞姆的态度。这家报纸要求伊拉克政府更加警惕和坚定，同时，政府更有必要依靠人民和为人民提供机会以便使他们能够富有成效地和严肃地表示支持的立场。
