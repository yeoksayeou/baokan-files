Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: Liu Changsheng, President of the China-Africa People's Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Patrice Lumumba, Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, on July 12th, supporting the Congolese people's just struggle for national independence. The telegram stated that the Chinese people, with extreme anger, strongly protest against the Belgian colonialists' brutal armed intervention against the Congolese people, supported by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, and extend the highest respect to the Congolese people who are engaged in a heroic struggle for the sacred cause of national independence.

The telegram pointed out that the Belgian colonialists' armed intervention tore off the mask of "bestowing" independence on the Congo, exposing the colonialists' ambition to permanently occupy the Congo. The imperialist bloc, headed by U.S. imperialism, quickly colluded with the Belgian colonialists, attempting to extinguish the Congolese people's resolute struggle for independence through bloody suppression. These bloody facts once again prove to the Congolese people and the people of the world that the imperialists will never voluntarily withdraw from African colonies, and that U.S. imperialism in particular is trying every means to invade Africa and replace the rule of the old colonialists. U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the world's people in their struggle for independence, democracy, freedom, and peace.

The telegram said that the Congolese people's struggle is by no means isolated; it is an indivisible part of the worldwide people's struggle against imperialist policies of aggression and war, and for the defense of world peace. We firmly support Prime Minister Lumumba's statement that "we will defend our country to the very end." The Chinese people will always stand with the Congolese people and resolutely support the Congolese people's just struggle for national independence. We firmly believe that, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, the Congolese people, united and persistent in their struggle, will surely be able to drive imperialism out of the Congo; the people of all African countries, united and persistent in their struggle, will surely be able to drive imperialism out of Africa. Victory belongs to the people of the Congo and African countries.

    中非友协会长刘长胜致电卢蒙巴总理支持刚果人民斗争
　　刚果人民坚持斗争就能赶走帝国主义
　　帝国主义者决不甘心自动退出非洲　美帝国主义是世界人民的头号敌人
    新华社13日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜12日致电刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴，支持刚果人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。电报说，中国人民怀着万分愤怒的心情，强烈抗议比利时殖民主义者在以美国为首的帝国主义集团的支持下，对刚果人民进行横暴武装干涉的侵略罪行，并向正在为民族独立的神圣事业而进行英勇斗争的刚果人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    电报指出，比利时殖民主义者的武装干涉，撕破了“恩赐”刚果独立的假面具，暴露了殖民主义者永远霸占刚果的野心。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团同比利时殖民主义者迅速勾结起来，企图用血腥镇压来扑灭刚果人民坚决要求独立的斗争。这些血淋淋的事实再一次向刚果人民以及全世界的人民证明：帝国主义者是决不甘心自动退出非洲殖民地的，特别是美帝国主义正千方百计企图侵入非洲，代替旧殖民主义者的统治。美帝国主义是世界人民争取独立、民主、自由、和平的头号敌人。
    电报说，刚果人民的斗争决不是孤立的，它是全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策保卫世界和平的不可分割的一部分。我们坚决拥护卢蒙巴总理阁下关于“我们将保卫我们的国家直到最后”的声明。中国人民永远站在刚果人民一边，坚决支持刚果人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。我们深信，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，刚果人民团结起来，坚持斗争，一定能够把帝国主义赶出刚果去；非洲各国人民团结起来，坚持斗争，一定能够把帝国主义赶出非洲去。胜利属于刚果和非洲各国人民。
