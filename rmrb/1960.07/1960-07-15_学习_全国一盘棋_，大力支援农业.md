　　Learning from "The Whole Country as a Chessboard" and Vigorously Support Agriculture

　　"The whole country as a chessboard" is our Party's strategic policy in leading economic construction. Only by correctly implementing this policy can the national economy develop both at high speed and in proportion.

　　Dialectical materialism believes that all things in the world are not isolated, but are interconnected and mutually restrictive. The various units and departments in the national economy are also not irrelevant to each other, but are closely related and interdependent. They constitute a unified organism. As Chairman Mao told us, the national economic construction is like a chessboard, and various regions, departments, and units are like the pieces on this chessboard. Generals, advisors, elephants, chariots, horses, cannons, and pawns all play a certain role in the overall game. We cannot say that pawns are unimportant. On the other hand, each piece is only a component of the entire game, and must act under unified command for a common purpose to fully exert its role. If each piece acts independently, the game will surely be lost. Therefore, each unit in the national economy must play the role it should according to the needs of the national economy, and cannot consider issues solely from a local perspective. "The Empty Fort Strategy" is a good play, but it is not enough to have Zhuge Liang alone. There must be a pageboy playing the qin on the city tower, and there must be old soldiers sweeping the streets with the four gates wide open. If everyone wants to be the protagonist, and everyone plays Zhuge Liang, what would it be like to have a group of Zhuge Liangs on stage? The distinction between protagonist and supporting role will exist at all times. Both are important, and neither can be missing. However, some people only know themselves and not others, only want to be the protagonist and are unwilling to play a supporting role. They like to place themselves above others and put their own unit's interests in opposition to the interests of the entire national economy. Although there are very few such people, they have indeed had a very bad influence.

　　Currently, under the guidance of the "whole country as a chessboard" policy, workers across the country are giving full play to their strengths in various positions to serve the socialist construction of the motherland. Take our workshop as an example. Our workshop originally produced machine tools, but now the countryside urgently needs a large number of diesel engines as irrigation power. Therefore, the state assigned us the task of casting diesel engines. At that time, a small number of workers couldn't understand it, thinking that our factory produced machine tools. Even if we don't get a marshal this year, we should be a pioneer. Making diesel engines is just doing odd jobs, and machine tools should not give way to diesel engines. In response to this situation, we studied Chairman Mao's thought of "the whole country as a chessboard," which made everyone clearly understand the relationship between the overall situation and the part, the protagonist and the supporting role. After studying, the workers said: Our workshop is a component of the entire national economy and cannot act independently. For the sake of the overall interests, we should be pawns when we should be pawns. We must never say that our workshop must be the commander. A machine tool cannot be assembled well if it is missing a screw. The national production plan is so complex. If everyone does not earnestly implement the "whole country as a chessboard" policy, how can we talk about developing production at high speed and in proportion? Producing machine tools is important, and producing diesel engines is also important. To ensure a greater harvest of grain this year, a large number of diesel engines are urgently needed. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and industry should support agriculture if we are to vigorously develop agriculture. Now that the Party has entrusted us with this glorious task, how important is this role!

　　After we understood the thought of "the whole country as a chessboard," the battle cry of "Fight for diesel engines, fight for the comprehensive and overfulfillment of the national economic plan!" encouraged everyone's heart. We concentrated the workshop's superior forces, and groups and individuals demonstrated a high degree of cooperation. Those who were not united in the past are now united, and those who had localism in the past have now established collectivist ideas. This communist style of close cooperation for a common purpose appeared everywhere, thereby ensuring the successful completion of the diesel engine casting task.

　　Whether or not one has the thought of "the whole country as a chessboard" reflects a person's level of communist consciousness, and shows whether he has jumped out of the small circle of localism and individualism. Earnestly studying and implementing the "whole country as a chessboard" policy can establish collectivist and communist ideas, and make people understand that everything cannot be separated from the collective. A big tree has one root, and its branches and leaves must be connected to it in order to grow luxuriantly. If a leaf is separated from the branch, it can only drift in the wind, and eventually it will wither and rot.

　　The entire national economic plan is like a person, and we can only be one of the millions of cells that make up this human body. Cells can only play their role for the health and growth of this person, and cannot act independently apart from this person. Therefore, we cannot place the plans of the workshop, team, or individual above the factory plan and the national plan. Only by implementing the requirements of the national plan and the factory plan into the plans of the team and individual can we ensure the proportionate development of the national economic plan.

　　In a word, we must resolutely be one of the millions of cells in this rapidly growing giant, and always strive for the health and growth of this giant.

　　学习“全国一盘棋”，大力支援农业
　　沈阳第三机床厂工人　侯锡邦
    “全国一盘棋”是我们党在领导经济建设方面的战略方针。正确地贯彻这个方针，才能使国民经济既高速度又按比例地发展。
    唯物辩证法认为，世界万物不是孤立的，而是相互联系、相互制约的。国民经济中的各个单位、各个部门也不是互不相干的，而是密切联系、息息相关的。它们构成了一个统一的有机体。正如毛主席告诉我们的，全国经济建设事业好比一盘棋，各地区、各部门、各单位好比这盘棋的各个棋子。将、士、象、车、马、炮和小卒等在全盘棋中都起着一定的作用，不能说小卒就不重要了；另一方面，每个棋子又只是全盘棋的一个组成部门，必须在统一指挥下为共同的目的而行动，才能充分发挥自己的作用，如果每个棋子都闹独立性，那这盘棋必定要输的。因此，国家经济中的各个单位，必须根据全国经济的需要，该当什么角色，就当什么角色，不能单纯从局部观点出发考虑问题。“空城计”是一出好戏，可是光有诸葛亮也不行，城楼上必须有琴童相配，四门大开没有扫街的老军也不成。如果大家都想当主角，人人都演诸葛亮，戏一开台，出来一群诸葛亮，那还像话吗？主角和配角之分到什么时候都会有，两者都重要，缺一不成。但是有一些人只知有己，不知有人，只想当主角，不愿演配角，喜欢把自己摆的高出一头，把自己单位的利益和整个国民经济的利益对立起来，这样的人虽然很少，但也的确起了很坏的影响。
    目前全国职工正在“全国一盘棋”方针的指导下，在各个不同岗位上充分发挥自己的力量，为祖国的社会主义建设事业服务。就以我们车间来说吧。我们车间本来是生产机床的，现在农村迫切需要大批柴油机作为灌溉动力，因此国家就交给我们铸造柴油机的任务。当时有少数工人想不通，认为我们厂是生产机床的，今年弄不上个元帅，也要当上个先锋，做柴油机的活是打零杂，机床不应给柴油机让路。针对这个情况，我们学习了毛主席的“全国一盘棋”的思想，使大家明确认识到全局和部分、主角和配角的关系。工人们在学习后说：我们车间是整个国民经济中的一个组成部分，不能闹独立性。为了全局的利益，该当小卒就当小卒，绝不能说我们这个车间非当老帅不可。一台机床少一个螺丝钉都装不好，全国的生产计划这样复杂，如果大家不认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，怎么能谈得上高速度按比例地发展生产呢？生产机床固然重要，生产柴油机也是重要的。要确保今年粮食更大的丰收，就迫切需要大批的柴油机。农业是国民经济发展的基础，我们要大力发展农业，工业就应该支援农业。现在党把这光荣任务交给我们，这个角色该多么重要啊！
    当我们领会了“全国一盘棋”的思想以后，“为柴油机而战，为全面超额完成国民经济计划而战！”这个战斗号召就鼓舞着我们每个人的心。我们集中了车间的优势兵力，组与组、人与人之间发挥了高度的协作精神，过去不团结的，现在团结了，过去有本位主义的，现在树立了集体主义思想。这种为了共同的目的而紧密协作的共产主义风格到处出现，从而保证了铸造柴油机任务的胜利完成。
    有没有“全国一盘棋”的思想，反映出一个人的共产主义觉悟水平，说明他是不是已经跳出本位主义、个人主义的小圈子。认真地学习和贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，可以树立集体主义、共产主义的思想，使人懂得事事不能离开集体。一棵大树是一个根，各个枝叶要和它连接在一起，才能茂盛成长；如果哪一片叶子脱离了树枝，那就只能随风飘扬，最后就会干枯腐烂。
    整个国民经济计划又好比是一个人，我们只能是组成这个人体的千百万细胞中的一个，细胞只能为这个人的健康和成长发挥其作用，不能离开这个人去单独行事。因此，我们不能把车间、小组或个人的计划摆在厂计划和国家计划之上，而只有按国家计划、厂计划的要求，落实到小组、个人的计划中去，才能确保国民经济计划按比例的发展。
    总的一句话，我们要坚决做这个迅速成长的巨人身上的千百万个细胞中的一个，永远为这个巨人的健康和成长而奋斗。
