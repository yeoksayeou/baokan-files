Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 30th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today passed the current struggle policy against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and election countermeasures at a council meeting held in Atami. These two struggle programs stipulate that "Sohyo," which has 3.6 million members, will fight for the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty and the establishment of a democratic government.

About 150 people, including "Sohyo" leaders and representatives from trade unions across the country, attended today's meeting.

The current struggle policy against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" stipulates: 1. People from all walks of life will issue declarations refusing to recognize the new "Security Treaty" and strive to collect 30 million signatures on the declarations; 2. Launch a fundraising campaign for the struggle against the new "Security Treaty"; 3. Launch a movement to protest the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression of participants in the movement against the new "Security Treaty"; 4. Hold lectures throughout the country on opposing the new "Security Treaty"; 5. Hold reports on the struggle against the new "Security Treaty"; 6. Strengthen support for the strike of the Miike coal miners.

"Sohyo's" election countermeasures stipulate that "Sohyo" demands to establish a "democratic government" through the general election, "a government that does not recognize the 'Security Treaty,' abides by the constitution, and adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality."

The election countermeasures state that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will recommend candidates from progressive parties, mainly from the Socialist Party, in the upcoming general election. The election countermeasures stipulate that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan should intensify its propaganda campaign to win voter support for progressive candidates.

The election countermeasures also state that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will also nominate candidates from its union members.

When presenting and explaining these two struggle programs to the meeting, "Sohyo" Secretary-General Akira Iwai said that "Sohyo" refuses to recognize that the new "Security Treaty" has taken effect; "Sohyo" will stand at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle to abolish the military alliance treaty.

After Akira Iwai's speech, "Sohyo" Chairman Kaoru Ota explained the executive committee's policy on the labor movement for 1960.

During the discussion of this movement policy, some union representatives demanded a more vigorous struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, forcing Nobusuke Kishida to resign immediately, dissolving the Diet, and crushing the reactionaries' conspiracy to suppress workers.

Soichi Hosoi, a representative of the National Railway Workers' Union, demanded at the meeting that "Sohyo" should clearly point out that US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital are the enemies of the workers. Hosoi emphasized, "Without identifying our enemies, workers cannot effectively fight against the conspiracy to replace Kishida Nobusuke with someone like Kishida Nobusuke."

Miyoji Hiragaki, a representative of the Japan Teachers' Union, pointed out that since Kishida Nobusuke's policy is to try to ease the atmosphere in the coming period and thereby quell the workers' emotions, it is necessary to continue to attack the reactionaries constantly.

The meeting will continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 30th: About 1,000 Japanese railway, postal, telecommunications, transportation workers, and teachers held a rally today in front of the National Railway Corporation Building to oppose the National Railway Authority's conspiracy to punish railway workers who participated in the anti-"Security Treaty" strike and demand the revocation of this plan to suppress the people's patriotic struggle.

Kaoru Sato, Vice Chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, pointed out at the meeting that the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet has no right to punish National Railway workers. He demanded that the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet resign immediately and apologize to the people.

Sato announced that the Central Executive Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union decided on the 29th that if the Kishida Nobusuke government forcibly punishes the workers, the National Railway Workers' Union will conduct a struggle of strength again.

Kanju Kato, a representative of the Socialist Party, Goro Suto, a representative of the Communist Party, Tokuji Kameda, a representative of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, and Genzaburo Yoshino, a representative of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," spoke one after another, resolutely expressing that they would never allow the punishment of National Railway workers who participated in the patriotic and just struggle.

Kameda said that representatives of farmers from all over the country went to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office yesterday to protest the persecution of participants in the anti-"Security Treaty" struggle. He said that if the National Railway Authority dares to punish National Railway workers now, the farmers will surround the National Railway Corporation Building to express their strong protest.

Yoshino said that the National Railway workers' strike was a protest against the Kishida Nobusuke government's disregard for public opinion and forced approval of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The Japanese people will thoroughly investigate the responsibility of the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet and will always support the struggle of the National Railway workers.

After the meeting, all the participants held a demonstration parade near the National Railway Corporation Building and in front of the Tokyo Central Post Office. The meeting also sent representatives to the National Railway Authority, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Telecommunications and Telephone Corporation, and the Metropolitan Police Department to demonstrate.

One team, composed of workers and representatives of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," and the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, met with the person in charge of the National Railway Authority and lodged a serious protest with him. They told the person in charge of the National Railway Authority that it is the people's right to oppose the "Security Treaty" that threatens peace and independence, and punishing workers is an absurd measure. They firmly stated that if the Kishida Nobusuke government insists on punishing, the workers will conduct a struggle of strength again and fight back.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: The measures of the traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishida to suppress the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement have aroused the unparalleled anger of Japanese workers, who are determined to give the Kishida Cabinet a strong counterattack.

The National Railway Workers' Union held a Central Executive Committee meeting today to discuss the current struggle policies such as opposing illegal suppression and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet. The meeting decided that, considering that the Kishida Cabinet will "punish" the workers who participated in the June 4th general strike and the June 22nd general strike, the union decided to hold protest demonstrations and workplace rallies to confront this. To this end, the union will mobilize 15,000 to 20,000 union members every day from June 30th to July 5th to hold protest demonstrations.

The meeting also decided that on the second day after the authorities announced the "punishment" of the workers, workplace rallies will be held simultaneously across the country during working hours, and the struggle will continue until the illegal "punishment" is revoked.

It is reported that the union has already issued struggle instructions to local branches today.

The 10th National Congress of the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union issued a declaration today at the conclusion of the five-day congress, pointing out that under the situation that the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet attempts to delay its resignation and attempts to "punish" and suppress the workers, the members of the "National Railway" Locomotive Engineers' Union decided to join the "Sohyo" in order to strengthen the struggle.

Japanese radio said that because this union participated in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty," this congress strengthened its organizational power and presented an unprecedented unity. For example, regarding the issue of "punishing" workers who participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," the union decided to launch a strong struggle to counterattack.

The "Sohyo" Osaka branch also decided to hold a rally of 100,000 people in Osaka on July 2 to oppose "punishment" and hold a demonstration parade.

    日本总评确定当前斗争方针与大选对策
    决定征集三千万人签名不承认日美军事同盟条约
    东京工人和教职员集会坚决反对岸信介政府非法镇压
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在热海市举行的评议员会议上通过了反对新日美
  “安全条约”的当前斗争方针和大选对策。这两个斗争纲领规定，拥有三百六十万会员的“总评”要为废除日美军事同盟条约和建立民主政府而斗争。
    出席今天会议的有“总评”领导干部和各地工会代表共约一百五十人。
    反对新日美“安全条约”的当前斗争方针规定：一、由各界人民发表不承认新“安全条约”的宣言并争取三千万人在宣言上签名；二、为反对新“安全条约”斗争展开征集经费的运动；三、开展抗议岸信介政府镇压反对新“安全条约”运动参加者的运动；四、在全国各地举行关于反对新“安全条约”的讲演会；五、举行关于反对新“安全条约”斗争情况的报告会；六、加强支持三池煤矿工人的罢工。
    “总评”的大选对策规定，“总评”要求通过大选“成立民主政府，这个政府不承认‘安全条约’，遵守宪法，坚持和平中立政策”。
    大选对策说，日本工会总评议会在将要举行的大选中将从进步党派中，主要是从社会党中，推荐候选人。大选对策规定，日本工会总评议会应该加紧进行宣传运动，以便争取选民支持进步的候选人。
    大选对策并且说，日本工会总评议会还将从它的工会会员中推选候选人。
      “总评”事务局长岩井章在向会议提出和说明这两个斗争纲领时说，“总评”拒绝承认新“安全条约”已经生效；“总评”将站在日本人民争取废除军事同盟条约的斗争的最前列。
    在岩井章发言后，“总评”议长太田熏说明了干事会关于1960年的工人运动方针。
    在讨论这个运动方针时，一些工会的代表要求更加强有力地进行反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，迫使岸信介立即辞职，使国会解散和粉碎反动派镇压工人的阴谋。
    国营铁道工会的代表细井宗一在会上要求，“总评”应当明确地指出，美帝国主义和日本垄断资本是工人的敌人。细井强调说，“不指明我们的敌人，工人就不能同那种以类似岸信介的人来替代岸信介的阴谋进行有效的斗争。”
    日本教职员工会的代表平垣美代司指出，既然岸信介的政策是企图使今后一个时期的气氛缓和下来从而平息工人的情绪，那就有必要继续不断地向反动派进攻。
    会议明天将继续举行。
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本铁路、邮电、交通工人和教职员共约一千人今天在国营铁道公司大厦前面举行大会，反对国营铁道当局处罚参加反对“安全条约”罢工的铁道工人的阴谋，要求撤销这个镇压人民爱国斗争的计划。
    国营铁道工会副委员长佐藤魁在大会上指出，岸信介内阁无权处分国营铁道工人。他要求岸信介内阁立即辞职向人民请罪。
    佐藤宣布，国营铁道工会中央执行委员会29日决定，如果岸信介政府强行处罚工人，国营铁道工会将再次进行实力斗争。
    社会党代表加藤勘十、共产党代表须藤五郎、全日本农民协会联合会代表龟田得治、“安全条约批判会”代表吉野源三郎相继讲话，坚决表示绝不容许处罚参加爱国正义斗争的国营铁道工人。
    龟田说，来自全国的农民代表昨天到东京地方检察厅抗议迫害反对“安全条约”斗争的参加者。他说，如果现在国营铁道当局胆敢处罚国营铁道工人，农民将包围国营铁道公司大厦，表示强烈的抗议。
    吉野说，国营铁道工人罢工是对岸信介政府忽视舆论、强行批准新日美“安全条约”的抗议。日本人民将彻底追究岸信介内阁的责任，并且始终支持国营铁道工人的斗争。
    大会结束后，全体与会者在国营铁道公司大厦附近和东京中央邮电局前面举行了示威游行。大会并且派遣代表到国营铁道当局、邮政省、电信电话公司和警视厅等处示威。
    其中一队由工人和社会党、共产党、“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”以及拥护宪法国民联合会代表组成的代表团，会见了国营铁道当局负责人，向他提出了严重抗议。他们向国营铁道当局负责人说，人民反对威胁和平与独立的“安全条约”，是人民的权利，处罚工人是荒谬绝伦的措施。他们坚决表示，假如岸信介政府硬要处罚，工人将再次进行实力斗争，进行还击。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本卖国首相岸信介阴谋镇压日本人民反美爱国运动的措施，激起了日本工人的无比愤怒，他们决心给岸内阁以强有力的反击。
    国营铁道工会今天举行中央执行委员会会议，讨论了反对非法镇压和要求立即解散国会等当前的斗争方针。会议决定，考虑到岸内阁将“处分”参加六·四总罢工和六·二二总罢工的工人，工会决定举行抗议示威和工作场所集会来对抗。为此，工会要从6月30日起到7月5日止每天动员工会会员一万五千人到二万人举行抗议示威。
    会议还决定在当局宣布“处分”工人的第二天，将在全国各地同时举行占用工作时间的工作场所大会，不断进行斗争，直到撤销非法“处分”。
    据报道，工会今天已经向各地方分会发出斗争指令。
    国营铁道机车工会第十次全国代表大会今天在结束为期五天的大会时发表宣言指出，岸信介内阁企图拖延下台，并且企图“处分”和镇压工人，在这样的形势下，“国铁”机车工会会员决定加入“总评”以便加强斗争。
    日本电台说，由于这个工会参加了反对新“安全条约”的斗争，使这次大会加强了组织力量，呈现出空前未有的统一。例如，对于“处分”参加反对“安全条约”斗争的工人的问题，工会决定展开强有力的斗争予以反击。
    “总评”大阪分会也决定在7月2日在大阪举行有十万人参加的反对“处分”奋起大会，并且举行示威游行。
