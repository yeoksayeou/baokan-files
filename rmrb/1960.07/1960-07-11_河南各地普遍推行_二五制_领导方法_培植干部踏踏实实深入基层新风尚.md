Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 10th: Since Henan Province actively implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, it has had significant effects on improving leadership style.

Practice in various places has proven that the "Two-Five System" leadership method enables leaders at all levels to better concentrate their main energy and most of their time, diligently immerse themselves in the forefront of production, participate in production, study production, and effectively direct production. According to statistics from Yanling, Mengjin, Zhenping, and Changyuan counties, after implementing this leadership method, about 70% of the cadres from county-level directly affiliated agencies were sent to the front lines of production to eat, live, work, and discuss solutions to production problems with the masses. The six secretaries and twenty-five members of the Yanling County Party Committee went to key communes, production brigades, and production teams. They generally adopted the method of "checking in the morning" (comprehensively checking production and work conditions), "working in the morning and afternoon" (laboring with the masses), and "helping in the evening" (helping production teams specifically check the day's production problems and arranging the next day's production), working meticulously and accurately to lead production with production. Ma Xiangtang, the first secretary of the county party committee, discovered during anti-drought labor in the Mafang Brigade of the Mafang Commune that the labor organization was unreasonable and the water source problem was not well resolved, resulting in wasted labor. He immediately studied with the commune members and helped the team reorganize its labor force, using springs at the bottom of the pond and rivers to solve the water source problem. Commune members composed quick rhymes praising: "Eating in the same canteen, discussing problems together, leaders taking the lead, knowing warmth and coolness, cadres and masses are one family, the Party's good proposition." After the Leicheng Brigade Party Branch of the Chadian Commune in Lin County implemented the "Two-Five System," all seven branch committee members went to the fields, contracting six small teams and eighteen work groups. When problems arose, they discussed and studied them with the commune members on the edge of the fields, enabling the autumn sowing task to be completed ahead of schedule this year. They also hired experienced commune members as advisors and consultants. At the same time, county and commune leaders going deep into the grassroots paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of backward teams and the management of canteens. For example, Mengjin County dispatched more than 300 cadres to strengthen the leadership of backward teams. After more than a month of hard work, fifteen teams have caught up with the advanced teams.

After the "Two-Five System" leadership method was implemented, many counties streamlined and merged their offices, greatly reducing meetings and reports, freeing up a large number of cadres to enrich the grassroots. Before the Changyuan County Commercial Bureau implemented the "Two-Five System," it had established seven temporary offices of various kinds and was still busy every day. Now, it has been merged into one office, which not only greatly reduces personnel but also makes the work organized and orderly. Mengjin County now has half as many meetings as in the past, achieving the requirements of "preparation before meetings, short meeting times, and good problem-solving." Counties, communes, and brigades have unified learning and meeting times, and unified the time for going deep into production and participating in labor, so that everyone has a work plan, and actions are united, enabling many cadres to do well in work, labor, and study. After Wenxian County's directly affiliated agencies implemented the "Two-Five System," there appeared "six mores" (more going to the countryside, more in-depth work, more contact with the masses, more participation in labor, more concern for the masses' lives, more summarizing and promoting experience) "three shorts and three lesses" (shorter meeting times and fewer meetings; shorter document lengths and fewer receipts and dispatches; shorter report items and fewer copies) and a new atmosphere in which everyone actively strives to go to the countryside.

Leaders at all levels going deep into the forefront of production, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses have further strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses. At the same time, because county, commune, brigade, and production team cadres meet in the fields, serving as teachers to each other, learning from each other, and jointly improving their leadership level.

### 河南各地普遍推行“二五制”领导方法　培植干部踏踏实实深入基层新风尚

    河南各地普遍推行“二五制”领导方法
　　培植干部踏踏实实深入基层新风尚
    新华社郑州10日电　河南省各地积极推行“二五制”的领导方法后，对改进领导作风已有显著效果。
    各地实践证明，“二五制”领导方法使各级领导干部能够更好地集中主要精力和大部分时间，踏踏实实地深入生产第一线，参加生产，研究生产，有效地指挥生产。据鄢陵、孟津、镇平、长垣四个县统计，推行这一领导方法后，县直属机关抽出70％左右的干部到生产第一线，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量解决生产中的问题。中共鄢陵县委六个书记和二十五个县委委员，分别到重点公社和生产大队、生产队，他们普遍采取了早晨转（全面检查生产和工作情况）、上下午干（与群众一起劳动）、晚上帮（帮助生产队具体检查一天生产中的问题，安排第二天的生产）的办法，工作细致，抓得准，作到了以生产领导生产。这个县县委第一书记马象堂在马坊公社马坊大队参加抗旱劳动中，发现劳动组织不合理，加上水源问题解决得不很好，发生窝工浪费现象。他随即和社员研究，帮助这个队重新安排劳力，利用塘底下泉、河底下泉，解决了水源问题。社员编快板称赞说：“吃饭同食堂，问题同商量，领导带头干，知暖又知凉，干群一家人，党的好主张”。林县茶店公社磊城大队党支部贯彻“二五制”后，七个支部委员都到田间，包干了六个小队十八个作业组，有问题就同社员一起在地边商量研究，使今年的秋播任务提前完成，他们还聘请生产有经验的社员当参谋和顾问。同时，县、社两级领导干部深入基层，特别注意加强对落后队的领导和食堂的管理工作。如孟津县抽出了三百多名干部加强对落后队的领导，经过一个多月的艰苦工作，已有十五个队赶上了先进队。
    “二五制”领导方法推行后，不少县精简、合并了办公机构，大大减少了会议和表报，腾出大批干部，充实了基层。长垣县商业局在推行“二五制”以前，设立了七个各种临时办公室，每天工作还忙不过来，现在合并为一个办公室，不仅人员大大减少，而且工作有条有理。孟津县现在会议比过去减少了一半，达到了“会前有准备，会议时间短，问题解决好”的要求。县、公社、大队做到学习、开会时间统一，深入生产、参加劳动时间统一，这样，人人工作有计划，上下行动一股劲，使许多干部作到了工作好、劳动好、学习好。温县直属机关实行“二五制”后，出现了“六多”（下乡多、工作深入多、联系群众多、参加劳动多、关心群众生活多、总结推广经验多）“三短三少”（会议时间短，开的次数少；文件篇幅短，收发件数少；报表项目短，份数少）和大家积极争取下乡的新气象。
    各级领导干部深入生产第一线，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，更加密切了党和群众的联系。同时由于县、社、大队、生产队四级干部会师田间，互为老师，互相学习，共同提高了领导水平。（附图片）
