Xinhua News Agency, 30th, Rome dispatch: A massive mass rally was held on the largest square in Genoa on the 28th to protest the national congress of the neo-fascist party to be held in the city on July 2nd.

More than 30,000 people attended the rally. Sandro Pertini, former leader of the Resistance movement and Socialist Party Senator, addressed the crowd at the meeting. He said: The neo-fascists are unscrupulously attempting to hold a congress in Genoa, a city that has made significant contributions to the anti-fascist struggle and has been honored for it, because they know that the current Italian government relies on their support to govern.

After the meeting, all the participants formed a procession, singing patriotic songs, to the monument to the guerrilla fighters who sacrificed themselves in the Resistance movement. A huge banner held high in front of the procession read: "The Resistance Movement is Still Going On." Thousands of citizens joined the procession along the way, bringing the number of demonstrators to more than 40,000. Although the police had doubled in size due to reinforcements from Milan, they did not dare to obstruct the procession.

Demonstrations against the neo-fascist party congress will continue in the coming days. Three hundred legal professionals have written to the Italian President and Prime Minister, demanding that the neo-fascist party be banned. One hundred and thirty-nine professors from the University of Genoa have also requested the Italian President and Prime Minister to ban the neo-fascist party from holding a congress in Genoa and to take concrete measures to stop the revival of fascism.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st, Rome dispatch: Genoa workers held a large-scale anti-fascist demonstration yesterday and bravely fought back when the police attacked them, engaging in six hours of street fighting with the police.

People from all walks of life in Genoa have been continuously demonstrating in recent days, protesting the neo-fascist party's attempt to hold a congress in Genoa. Yesterday, dockworkers, municipal workers, bus and tram drivers, and other workers in Genoa went on strike for this reason. The strike began at 1:00 p.m. local time. The strike completely stopped public transportation in Genoa, and most stores also closed during the strike.

The striking workers held a demonstration, with 10,000 to 15,000 people participating. When the demonstrators entered the central square of Genoa, the police used tear gas and flame throwers to attack the demonstration, attempting to disperse them. The demonstrators were forced to fight back against the police.

The demonstrators used cars, motorcycles, paving stones, tables, etc. to build barricades on the streets near the square, using stones to fight back against the police, and throwing the tear gas canisters thrown by the police back at them. Several police vehicles were overturned by the demonstrators.

The fighting between the demonstrators and the police lasted for six hours. (Attached picture)

    新华社30日讯　罗马消息：28日在热那亚最大的广场举行了规模巨大的群众集会，抗议将于7月2日在这个城市举行的新法西斯党全国代表大会。
    参加大会的有三万多人。前抵抗运动领袖、社会党参议员桑德罗·裴丁尼在会上向群众发表演说。他说：新法西斯分子竟然肆无忌惮地想在曾经为反法西斯斗争作出较大贡献并且因此得到荣誉的热那亚，召开代表大会，这是因为他们知道目前意大利政府是依靠他们支持才能执政的。
    大会以后，所有参加大会的人组成游行队伍，唱着爱国歌曲，到在抵抗运动中牺牲的游击战士纪念碑前去。高举在队伍面前的巨幅标语上写着：“抵抗运动还在继续进行”。有成千的市民一路参加游行队伍，从而使示威者的人数达到四万多。警察虽然由于来自米兰的增援而增加了一倍，但是不敢阻挠游行队伍。
    反对新法西斯党代表大会的示威将在今后几天内继续进行。三百个法律工作者写信给意大利总统和总理，要求禁止新法西斯党。热那亚大学的一百三十九位教授也向意大利总统和总理要求禁止新法西斯党在热那亚举行代表大会和要求采取具体措施制止法西斯主义的复活。
    新华社1日讯　罗马消息：热那亚工人昨天举行大规模反法西斯示威游行，并且在警察袭击他们的时候奋勇还击，同警察进行了六小时的街头搏斗。
    热那亚各阶层人民连日来不断举行示威，抗议新法西斯党想在热那亚开代表大会。昨天，热那亚的码头工人、市政工人、公共汽车和电车司机和其他工人为此举行了罢工。罢工从当地时间下午一点开始。这次罢工使热那亚的公共交通完全停顿，绝大部分商店在罢工期间也关门。
    罢工工人举行了游行示威，参加的有一万人到一万五千人。当示威者进入热那亚中心广场的时候，警察用催泪弹和火焰喷射器袭击示威队伍，企图驱散他们。示威群众被迫向警察反击。
    示威群众用汽车、摩托车、铺路的石子、桌子等在广场附近的街道筑起了街垒，用石子反击警察，并且把警察扔过来的催泪弹反掷过去，有好几辆警察的车辆被示威群众弄翻。
    示威者同警察的搏斗一直进行了六小时。（附图片）
