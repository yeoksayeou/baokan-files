　　Using Foreign Methods to Suit Local Conditions, Using Local Methods to Overcome Foreign Methods
　　——Impressions and Reflections
　　Gu Ming

　　We visited the Changjiang Fiber Textile Factory in Chongqing. This is a very simple small factory, but it is very famous, and the National Technical Innovation Conference was held here. When you enter this factory, you see textile machines made of wood and bamboo everywhere, one close to the other. The factory is located on a hillside, going down one level is a factory workshop, going down another level is another factory workshop, layer after layer. The factory buildings are also sheds made of bamboo and wood. However, the machines are constantly running, and the women and elderly people standing next to them to manage the machines are all so relaxed and happy, carefully taking care of the machines, as if they do not feel any fatigue. Every machine and machine part in this factory was made by them personally, without asking anyone else to do it for them. After the visit, we suddenly felt that “what is there to be ashamed of.”

　　It turns out that this factory started from scratch with two tiger-head pliers to make revolution. They have successively manufactured more than 20 sets of simple local machines such as wooden guide tube machines, fiber guide machines, winding machines, combing machines, and silk carrying machines; and they have converted all hand-pulled and foot-pedaled wooden looms into electric looms, and installed automatic shuttle changing equipment, so that the entire factory has basically achieved mechanization and partial automation. However, there is not a single technician in this factory. Although many workers used to work in weaving, they had never seen “foreign” machines, let alone understood the principle of "electric motors." They went to some textile factories to learn from experience. They creatively applied the principle of "foreign" machines from other factories to the wooden local equipment of their factory, using foreign methods to suit local conditions, using local methods to overcome foreign methods. After they went to other factories to study and visit, and mastered the principle of automatic shuttle changing of new machines and "foreign" equipment, they combined it with the actual situation of their factory to simplify some processes, save many parts, and use bamboo and wood materials to self-produce and self-manage the automatic shuttle changing device of the local cloth machine, and quickly achieved success.

　　Using foreign methods to suit local conditions, using local methods to overcome foreign methods. This is the biggest feature of the technical innovation and technical revolution of the Changjiang Fiber Textile Factory. Therefore, they can use bamboo and wood as steel and hemp rope as belts to create modern machines. Through the example of this factory, we can realize that local methods are not as some people understand them, as low-level and backward methods, but as a temporary expedient method adopted before there are foreign equipment and foreign methods. They creatively apply the principle of "foreign" machines to local equipment, mainly using its principle, not simply copying it, so they can simplify some processes and save many parts. From here, it can also be clearly seen that local methods are produced by the workers from rich production experience, and are unique methods that meet the local production reality and actual needs. This kind of creation from the broad masses, native-born and native-grown, although easy to manufacture and easy to operate, is advanced, conforms to scientific principles, and is full of strong vitality. Some even far exceed foreign methods. In science, it is a high-level simplicity, and in production, it has unexpected huge economic effects. As a result, miracles such as “high quality from the local,” “excellence from the local,” and “sharpness from the local” have appeared. Local methods have solved many problems that cannot be solved by foreign methods, and created many things that cannot be created by foreign methods. From here, we can also more clearly realize that production practice is the source of science's production and development. These advanced and scientific methods can only be created by the masses with rich experience in production practice.

　　Local methods are simple and easy to implement, the machinery is exquisite and flexible, the appearance is not scary, materials are locally sourced, easy to popularize, and it is constantly improving, constantly perfecting, constantly growing and expanding on the basis of popularization. It is precisely because of continuous improvement on the basis of popularization, and continuous popularization under the guidance of improvement, that the role of local methods can become greater and greater, and the infinite power of local methods can be fully exerted.

　　Emphasizing local methods does not mean denying foreign methods. “Use local methods where possible, use foreign methods where possible,” and foreign methods can come from local methods. Now many local methods have broken the superstition that foreign methods cannot be surpassed. Local methods have shattered the myth that foreign methods are unattainable. On the contrary, "using local methods to overcome foreign methods, using foreign methods to suit local conditions," has broken through foreign methods, making foreign principles serve local equipment obediently. It is also precisely because of the use of local methods that more and more extensive masses can be mobilized to take action, and the technical revolution movement can become a broad mass movement. This is the source of vitality of the current large-scale technical revolution.

　　以洋就土　以土攻洋
　　——见闻杂感
　　顾明
    我们来到了重庆市的长江纤维纺织厂。这是一个很简陋的小厂，但是名气很大，全国技术革新会在这里还开过现场会。当你进到了这个厂时，满眼看到的都是木、竹结构的纺织机，一台紧挨着一台，厂是设在山坡上的，下去一层是厂房车间，再下去一层又是厂房车间，一层又一层。厂房也是竹木结构的棚子。然而机器在不停地转动，站在旁边管理机器的，尽是一些妇女和老人，他们都是那样轻松愉快，细心地照管着机器，好像感觉不到什么疲劳。这个厂的每一部机器和机器零件都是他们亲手制成的，没有仰求什么人代劳。参观之后使我们顿然产生了“何陋之有”的感觉。
    原来这个厂是以两把虎头钳闹革命白手起家的。他们先后制造了木质导筒机、导纤机、络纱机、牵梳机、扛丝机等土简机器二十多台；并把所有手拉脚踩的木头织布机，全部改为电动织布机，还装设了自动换梭等设备，使全厂基本上实现了机械化和部分自动化。可是这个厂没有一个技术人员。许多工人虽然过去也是以织布为业，但是从未见过“洋”机器，更谈不上懂“电动机”的原理。他们到一些纺织厂去取经。他们创造性地把别厂“洋”机器的原理，用在本厂木质土设备上，以洋就土，以土攻洋。他们到别的厂学习参观之后，掌握了新机器、“洋”设备自动换梭的原理，就结合本厂情况简化了一些工序，省去不少零件，用竹木材料自配自搞土布机的自动换梭装置，并且很快的获得了成功。
    以洋就土，以土攻洋。这是长江纤维纺织厂技术革新和技术革命的最大特点。因此能够用竹木当钢材，以麻绳替皮带，造出了现代化的机器来。通过这个厂的事例，我们可以认识到土办法并不像某些人所理解的那样，是低级的、落后的办法，是一种在没有洋设备、洋办法之前的暂时采用的权宜办法。而他们是创造性地把“洋”机器的原理，用在土设备上，主要是用它的原理，而不是依样画葫芦，所以他们能简化了一些工序，省去不少零件。从这里又可以明显地看出，土办法是工人们从丰富的生产经验中产生的，是切合当地生产实际情况和实际需要的独创的办法。这种来自广大群众的、土生土长的创造，虽然制造容易，操作简便，却是先进的，符合科学原理，富有强大生命力，有些甚至远远超过洋办法，在科学上是一种高级的简单，在生产上有意想不到的巨大经济效果。于是“土中出高”、“土中出精”、“土中出尖”等等的奇迹出现了。土办法解决了许多用洋办法解决不了的问题，创造了许多用洋办法创造不出的东西。从这里，我们也可以更清楚地认识到生产实践正是科学产生和发展的泉源。这些既先进又科学的办法，只有在具有丰富经验的群众在生产实践中才能创造出来。
    土办法简单易行，机械精巧灵活，外貌也不吓人，就地取材，易于普及，而且它也在普及的基础上不断提高，不断完善，不断成长和壮大。正是由于在普及的基础上不断提高，在提高的指导下再不断的普及，才能使土办法的作用越来越大，才能充分发挥土办法的无穷威力。
    强调土办法并不等于否定洋的。“能土则土，能洋则洋”，而且土中可以出洋。现在许多土办法已经破除了洋办法不可超越的迷信。土办法已经粉碎了洋办法是可望而不可及的神话。恰恰相反，“以土攻洋，以洋就土”，把洋办法攻破了，使洋原理驯服地为土设备服务。也正是因为用了土办法才能动员更多更广泛的群众动起手来，才能使技术革命运动成为广泛的群众运动。这是目前声势浩大的技术革命的生命力的源泉。
