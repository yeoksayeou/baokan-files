　　Editor's Note
    "In Our Commune" is meeting readers for the fifth time today. Some readers have recently written to us, welcoming this reader's letter column and suggesting that it be made permanent. This is the most powerful support and encouragement for us. We plan to make this column one of the permanent columns on the rural page, tentatively published once a week. To make this column successful, we believe that the most important thing is for everyone to read it and everyone to contribute. That is to say, the cadres and members of the rural people's communes, everyone should care about and support this column, constantly offer opinions, and constantly write articles. At present, we especially need the following types of articles: 1. Praising new people and new things in rural people's communes; 2. Reflecting various new atmospheres in the communes; 3. Introducing good experiences of oneself or others in production and work; 4. Proposing various criticisms and suggestions. Please send submissions and letters to the "In Our Commune" column on the rural page of this newspaper.

专栏：在我们公社里

　　编者的话
    “在我们公社里”今天第五次跟读者见面。有些读者最近给我们来信，表示欢迎这个读者来信专栏，建议把它固定下来。这对我们是最有力的支持和鞭策。我们打算把这个专栏作为农村版上固定的专栏之一，暂定每星期出版一次。为了把这个专栏搞好，我们觉得，最重要的一条是大家看，大家办。这就是说，农村人民公社的干部和社员同志们，大家都来关心和支持这个专栏，经常提意见，经常写稿子。目前我们特别需要这几类稿子：一、表扬农村人民公社中的新人新事的；二、反映公社中的各种新气象的；三、介绍自己或别人在生产和工作中的好经验的；四、提出各种批评和建议的。来稿和信件请寄本报农村版“在我们公社里”专栏。
