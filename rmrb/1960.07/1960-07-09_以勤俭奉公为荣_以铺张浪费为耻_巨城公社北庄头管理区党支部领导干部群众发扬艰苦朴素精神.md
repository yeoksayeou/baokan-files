Taking Pride in Diligence, Thrift, and Serving the Public; Considering Extravagance and Waste Shameful
Leading Cadres and Masses of the Beizhuangtou Management District Party Branch of Jucheng Commune Promote the Spirit of Hard Work and Plain Living

(Reported by this newspaper) The party members and cadres of the Beizhuangtou Management District of the Jucheng People's Commune in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, have, under the leadership of the Party branch for more than a year, emphasized hard work and plain living, and selfless devotion to the public, leading all commune members to establish a new ethos of taking diligence and selflessness as honor, and extravagance and selfishness as shame. As a result, the Party's prestige among the masses has been further enhanced, the Party's leadership has been greatly strengthened, the unity of the entire management district has been enhanced, a large amount of funds has been saved, and the various production and construction tasks of the entire management district have been powerfully promoted.

The Beizhuangtou Management District Party Branch is an old branch with a history of more than twenty years. Hard work, plain living, and selfless devotion to the public are the excellent traditions of this management district. However, with the rapid development of production, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the income of commune members and public accumulation greatly increased, a small number of party members and cadres in the management district developed some extravagant and wasteful phenomena.

After discovering this phenomenon, the Beizhuangtou Management District Party Branch immediately took measures. At the end of 1958, it launched an ideological movement among all party members and cadres to emphasize hard work and plain living, and selfless devotion to the public. First, they studied documents, and then they organized everyone to discuss them. In order to understand the problem deeply and thoroughly, the Party branch also convened a meeting of commune member representatives to allow the masses to express their opinions. Through this movement, party members and cadres clearly realized that it was extremely wrong to only care about the present and not the future, to only care about ostentation and not production, and to only care about one's own interests and not the interests of the masses. A concept of taking diligence and selflessness as honor, and extravagance and selfishness as shame, began to be universally established among party members and cadres. On this basis, the Party branch further grasped the formulation of a complete set of strict financial procedures and improved the system of cadre work style.

After this movement, the excellent work style of hard work, plain living, and selfless devotion to the public in the Beizhuangtou Management District was revived.

First of all, party members and cadres strictly abide by various systems. The system stipulates that all expenditures exceeding five yuan must be approved by the commune member representative assembly. Because this system has been well adhered to, the management district has saved a lot of expenses in the past year or so. Last year, the management district planned to spend 1,120 yuan to buy four large cart frames. When it was brought up for discussion at the commune member representative assembly, the representatives believed that it would be enough to send commune members who were carpenters to make them themselves. As a result, a full 1,000 yuan was saved. Everyone demanded even stricter requirements of themselves in terms of money and grain.

In order to enable the masses to live well in affluent times as if they were living in poor times, the party members and cadres of the Beizhuangtou Management District also helped the masses overcome difficulties at the expense of themselves, demonstrating a high degree of communist spirit. In order to improve the daily life of the commune members, the Party branch secretary found that the cafeteria was not eating well, so he went to that cafeteria to eat and work as a cook to help improve the work. Before the Spring Festival last year, the cadres visited households and found that sixteen households with many people and few laborers had difficulties during the festival. The Party branch immediately mobilized Party and League members and cadres to promote the communist spirit, and continuously performed voluntary labor for eight nights, using the sideline income from voluntary labor to solve the problems of households in difficulty.

The change in the work style of party members and cadres greatly moved the masses. The idea of taking diligence and selflessness as honor, and extravagance and selfishness as shame, has taken root in the hearts of the people and has become a new ethos in the entire district. Those who used gas lamps tried to save fuel. The nursery teachers in the kindergarten made three or four hundred toys for the children without spending a penny. Because everyone managed the household and everyone participated, the management district built eighty-eight public houses in the past year or so, spending less than four hundred yuan in total, without using a single full workday.

The party members and cadres of the Beizhuangtou Management District have emphasized hard work, plain living, and selfless devotion to the public for more than a year, and as a result, they have greatly promoted the production and construction work of the management district, making this formerly the poorest management district in the commune a red flag for production leaps forward throughout the commune.

    以勤俭奉公为荣  以铺张浪费为耻
    巨城公社北庄头管理区党支部领导干部群众发扬艰苦朴素精神
    本报讯　山西省阳泉市巨城人民公社北庄头管理区的全体党员和干部，一年多来在党支部的领导下，大讲艰苦朴素，大讲克己为公，带动全体社员树立了以勤俭、大公无私为荣，以铺张、自私为耻的新风尚。结果进一步提高了党在群众中的威信，大大加强了党的领导，促进了全管理区的团结，节省了大量资金，有力地推动了全管理区的各项生产、建设工作。
    北庄头管理区党支部是一个已有二十多年历史的老支部，艰苦朴素、克己为公是这个管理区的优良传统。但是，在生产迅速发展，特别是经过1958年的大跃进，社员的收入和公共积累大大增加以后，管理区里的一小部分党员和干部，出现了一些铺张浪费现象。
    北庄头管理区党支部发现这种现象后，立即采取了措施，于1958年底，在全体党员和干部中开展了一个大讲艰苦朴素、大讲克己为公的思想运动。先是学习文件，然后组织大家讨论。为了把问题搞深搞透，党支部还召开了社员代表大会，让群众来发表意见。通过这样一次运动，党员和干部都明确地认识到：只顾眼前不顾长远，只顾排场不顾生产，和只顾自己不顾群众利益都是极端错误的。党员和干部中开始普遍树立起一种以勤俭、大公无私为荣，以铺张、自私为耻的观念。在这个基础上，党支部又进一步抓紧制定了一整套严格财务手续，改进干部作风的制度。
    经过这次运动，北庄头管理区过去那种艰苦朴素、克己为公的优良作风又发扬起来了。
    首先是党员和干部都很好的遵守各项制度。制度规定凡是五元以上的开支都要经过社员代表大会批准。因为这条制度坚持得好，管理区一年多来节省了许多开支。去年管理区计划要花一千一百二十元买四个大车架子，提到社员代表大会上讨论，代表们认为派会木匠活的社员自己动手制造就行了，结果整整节省了一千元。在钱、粮上，大家要求自己更是严格。
    北庄头管理区的党员和干部，为了使群众能在富日子当穷日子过的情况下把日子过好，他们还作到了舍己为人地去帮助群众克服困难，表现了高度的共产主义精神。为了搞好社员的日常生活，党支部书记发现那个食堂吃得不好，就到那个食堂吃饭、当炊事员，帮助改进工作。去年春节前，干部们下户访问，发现有十六户人多劳力少的社员过节有困难，党支部就立即动员党、团员和干部发扬共产主义精神，接连义务劳动了八个晚上，用义务劳动的副业收入，解决了困难户的问题。
    党员和干部作风的改变，使群众大为感动。以勤俭、大公无私为荣，以铺张、自私为耻的思想深入人心，并成为全区的新风尚。点汽灯的想办法省油。幼儿园的保育员给孩子作了三、四百件玩具不花一个钱。因为大家当家，大家动手，一年多来管理区建设了公用房屋八十八间，总共花了不到四百元，还没有用一个整工。
    北庄头管理区的党员和干部，一年多来大讲艰苦朴素、大讲克己为公，结果大大推动了管理区的生产、建设工作，使这个原来在公社里是最穷的管理区，成为全公社的一面生产跃进红旗。
