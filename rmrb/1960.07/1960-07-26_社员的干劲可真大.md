    The Commune Members' Enthusiasm is Truly Great
    Yán Guójūn, First Secretary of the CPC Jiahe County Committee, Hebei
    On the morning of July 1st, I came to Qin Village Commune with comrades from the Municipal Party Committee's working group.

    At this time, the commune members were working in the fields, shouting work songs. Although they were all covered in sweat, their enthusiasm did not diminish, and their faces, full of smiles, revealed an irrepressible excitement. Li Hui, the first secretary of the commune, said happily, "The enthusiasm of the commune members here is really great. When it's time to stop working, they don't want to go home even if you chase them. The girls in the 'Hundred Flowers Girls' Team' in the cotton fields are even more enthusiastic. They work during the day and light lamps at night to study culture."

    In the afternoon, everyone gathered to hoe cotton west of the pumping station. Male and female commune members each found a furrow, lined up in a row. Li Hui and Wang Xianchen, the secretary of the Qin Village Management Area, happened to be next to me. Li Hui hoed faster than me, but Wang Xianchen was always behind me. I asked him what he was studying behind me, and he said, "As soon as I saw you pick up the hoe, I knew you were an expert. Even our old hands here are only this good." I said with a smile, "I come from a peasant family. You can't beat me at farm work." At this moment, someone nearby shouted, "Look, the three-level secretaries are meeting in the fields!" I interjected, "We are five levels of cadres together with the commune members, a great battle in the fields." Everyone laughed.

    社员的干劲可真大
    中共河北交河县委第一书记　阎国钧
    7月1日上午，我同市委工作组的同志们一道来到秦村公社。
    这时，社员们正在地里喊着号子劳动，虽然个个都是汗流浃背，但是干劲不减，一副副的笑脸，透露出内心无法抑制的兴奋。这公社的第一书记李辉愉快地说：“这里的社员们干劲可够大的。收工的时候，撵着都不回家。棉花方里百花姑娘队的姑娘们，劲头更高，白天劳动，晚上还点上灯学文化。”
    下午，人们全集中在扬水站以西锄棉花。男女社员们各找田垅，一字摆开，刚好挨着我的是李辉和秦村管理区的书记王宪臣。李辉比我锄得快，王宪臣却老是在我的后边。我问他在我后边端详什么，他说：“我看你一拿锄，就知你是个内行，咱们这儿的老把式，也不过这两下子。”我笑着说：“我是庄稼人出身，干庄稼活你们拉不下我。”这时，不知谁在旁边嚷了一句：“看哪，现在是三级书记田间会师！”我插了一句说：“咱们是五级干部同社员一起，田间大会战。”大家都笑了起来。
