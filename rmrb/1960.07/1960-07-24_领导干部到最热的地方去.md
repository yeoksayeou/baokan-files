Under the call of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee to "transform the high-temperature season into a high-yield season," leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have gone deep into the hottest, most arduous, and most difficult places to effectively lead production. Now, whether in the iron ore mines exposed to the scorching sun or in the heat-steaming blast furnaces, whether in front of the open-hearth furnaces where fire blazes in all directions, the ingot casting plant with its pillars of fire, or beside the rolling mills where fire dragons dance, inspiring scenes of leading cadres and workers working together to demand high yields from the high temperatures can be seen everywhere.

The leaders of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee took the lead in going down to the grassroots level, laboring and consulting with the workers. Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, personally went to the No. 9 open-hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steel Plant and, together with the workers, withstood the scorching flames, shoveling magnesite refractory material into the furnace to repair the front wall. This action of the leading cadres, sharing labor and hardships with the masses, gave the workers of No. 9 open-hearth furnace great encouragement and strength. They worked hard to overcome the high temperatures and pioneered a new record of producing four heats per day with rapid steelmaking, and have maintained high production ever since. Brother furnaces also quickly caught up. In less than three days, No. 1 open-hearth furnace broke the record of No. 9 open-hearth furnace. After Yan Zhimin, Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, promoted the advanced operating experience of No. 6 open-hearth furnace to No. 10 open-hearth furnace during labor, this furnace saw a new situation of sustained high production. From the end of June to the beginning of July, in thirteen days, it produced more than 1,000 tons of steel for the country. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the leaders at all levels of the No. 2 Steel Plant established three command posts, working day and night in three shifts, taking turns to go deep into the front line of production, so that many problems arising in production were promptly resolved. Leading cadres of the East Anshan Iron Mine led technicians and management personnel to work in shifts at night to organize production, ensuring that someone was immediately available to guide repairs in the event of equipment failure, and that someone immediately arranged for the process if the upper and lower processes were not connected, so that the output of concentrate powder in the night shift increased sharply by about 30% compared with the past.

    领导干部到最热的地方去
    鞍山钢铁公司领导干部在中共鞍山市委“变高温季节为高产季节”的号召下，深入到最热的地方、最苦的地方、最困难的地方去切实领导生产。现在，无论在烈日曝晒的铁矿山或热气熏蒸的高炉上，无论在炉火四射的平炉前，火柱林立的铸锭厂或火龙翻舞的轧钢机旁，到处可以看到领导干部和工人一起向高温要高产的感人情景。
    鞍山市委和鞍钢党委的领导人带头下到基层，跟工人同劳动、同商量。中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰，亲自到第一炼钢厂九号平炉跟工人一起迎着灼热的火舌把镁火泥一锹锹送进炉去补前墙。领导干部这种跟群众同劳动共甘苦的行动，给九号平炉工人以巨大的鼓舞和力量，他们奋力战胜高温，首创日出四炉快速炼钢的新纪录，而且一直保持高产。兄弟平炉也急起直追，没出三天，一号平炉就刷新了九号平炉的纪录。鞍钢党委书记颜志敏在劳动中把六号平炉的先进操作经验推广到十号平炉以后，使这座炉子出现了持续高产的新局面，从6月末到7月上旬的十三天里，就为国家多生产了一千多吨钢。第二炼钢厂各级领导干部在党委领导下，成立三个指挥部，日夜三班，轮流深入生产前线，使生产中出现的许多问题及时得到了解决。东鞍山铁矿领导干部，率领技术人员和管理人员，轮流在夜里跟班劳动，组织生产，作到一旦设备发生故障立即有人指导检修，一旦上下道工序不衔接，马上有人进行安排，使夜班的精矿粉产量，比过去猛增30％左右。
