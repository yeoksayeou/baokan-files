	The Swimming Season in Baiyangdian
	Li Shubin
	Summer has arrived, and with it, the swimming season in Baiyangdian, Xushui County, Hebei.
	As you walk through the villages, you can hear the elderly cooling off in the streets and alleys, and the young women weaving mats, all enthusiastically talking about swimming. A mass summer swimming movement has already begun with great fervor in Baiyangdian.
	
	Competition on the Lake
	The Baiyangdian Commune Party Committee, in response to the County Party Committee's call for "350,000 people to participate in swimming this summer," mobilized over 40,000 people to participate in swimming activities. They also proposed an initiative to all brother communes in the county: "Carry out a mass swimming campaign to promote production." The main condition was that the number of people participating in swimming activities should reach over 95% of the total population. Xin'an Commune, also located near Baiyangdian and a semi-aquatic commune, had its Secretary, Yuan Jinduo, just returned from the National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education. After receiving the initiative from Baiyangdian Commune, he read it carefully several times. He believed that the Baiyangdian Commune's swimming movement was successful because of the solid organizational leadership. He immediately sent people to learn from their experience. After their return, Comrade Yuan Jinduo personally formulated a plan. Combining it with the spirit of the National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education, he also convened a mobilization meeting of over 700 people on June 20th. After the meeting, he organized a large propaganda team to write street poems and paint murals in every village. The commune also started a "Sports Newsletter" to introduce swimming experiences... After all the preparatory work was completed, Yuan Jinduo personally issued a "Friendship Competition Contract" with Yang Hongshan, the secretary of Baiyangdian Commune. Thus, the summer swimming competition between the two communes on the lake began.
	
	Floating Diving Platforms
	In order to encourage people to participate in swimming, the County Party Committee fully utilized the favorable conditions after the water conservancy projects of 1958, and launched a mass summer swimming movement involving 350,000 people: "Crossing rivers, passing canals, traversing reservoirs, and swimming in Baiyangdian." The people of Baiyangdian, known for their swimming skills, had their own unique style in this movement. To meet the needs of the masses, every village built simple diving platforms and swimming pools for children and adults. To better adapt to production and allow commune members to exercise at any time, many production teams, such as Dazhangzhuang and Yangdikou, even installed diving platforms on large "five-cabin" boats. Whenever commune members went to plant rice or manage fish, they would row the "five-cabin" boats with diving platforms to the production front. As soon as the whistle blew for work breaks, groups of young women and men would rush to the diving platforms, forming a long line to wait their turn to dive.
	
	In feudal society, women here were confined to their homes and rarely ventured out, let alone participate in swimming. Now, thanks to the widespread and deep-rooted mass swimming movement, over 80% of the young women have joined the swimming ranks. In the recent (July 9th) Baoding area swimming competition, the thirteen female athletes from Baiyangdian won three first prizes.
	
	Husband and Wife Competition
	One midday, under the scorching sun, a man and a woman were walking from Zhainan Production Team towards the swimming pool west of the village. The man was Han Xiaosheng, and the woman was Liu Xiaofen. They had been married for less than three months, but since the beginning of summer, they had been going to the swimming pool to practice swimming together after work and lunch every day. That day, not far from home, Xiaosheng said to Xiaofen, "The commune is going to hold a commune member swimming competition on July 1st, how about it?" "I've already planned it, I'm going to participate that day too," Xiaofen said. Xiaosheng just hummed, thinking she couldn't do it. Before he could say anything more, Xiaofen heard the tone of his words: "What's with the hum? You think I can't do it? Don't underestimate people, I'll race you today if you don't believe me!" With that, she walked to the swimming pool, and the couple started a tense swimming competition. After the 100-meter freestyle, Xiaofen was only one or two meters behind Xiaosheng, but she was still unconvinced and challenged Xiaosheng: "We'll see who's better tomorrow!"
	
	A Family on the Lake
	In the center of Baiyangdian, in the swimming pool of Quantou Production Team, you can often see an old man with white hair, this is the sixty-year-old Xia Zengxiang. His family has six members, besides his wife, there are three boys and a girl. Truly, a hero father has heroic sons, under his guidance, his children have all learned to swim since childhood, and they are all famous in swimming. His eldest son, Xia Zhangkou, is twenty-six years old this year, and is a second-level swimming athlete. In 1956, he represented Hebei Province in the National Swimming Championships held in Shanghai. In that competition, he competed with the nationally renowned Mu family. On July 8, 1958, his eldest son Xia Zhangkou and second son Xia Deshun represented the Baoding area in the Hebei Provincial Swimming Championships. At the meeting, his brothers won the first and third places respectively in the men's freestyle, sidestroke 200 meters, 800 meters, and 1500 meters. His third son, Xia Decai, and five-year-old daughter, Xia Shufen, are also famous swimming athletes in the commune and county. Because all of their family can swim, and they have repeatedly participated in swimming competitions in the county, city, and province, they have learned some swimming knowledge and techniques. Therefore, the village organized a swimming team of more than 70 people, with them as the main force. Now all the athletes have also learned diving, sidestroke, and breaststroke in their spare time. Their family is honorably called "The Swimming Family on the Lake."
	
	Children and the Elderly
	The summer sun is like a raging fire, making the children in the Duancun Kindergarten and the elderly in the Home for the Aged unbearably hot. The children in the kindergarten, thinking of the happy scenes of their mothers taking them swimming, looked at the auntie with their round eyes and asked to go swimming. The auntie took them to the swimming pool, and they jumped into the children's shallow pool like little frogs.
	
	The elderly in the Home for the Aged, whenever the team's small competition every seven days and big competition every half month are approaching, worry that their children will lag behind in the swimming competition. So on the day of the competition, the elderly in the Home for the Aged all come to cheer for their children participating in the swimming competition. Old Grandpa Tian Luosan, nearly seventy years old, saw that his child was swimming behind others, and wanted to take off his clothes and get into the water. Someone on the spot said: "Old Grandpa, this is tiring work, you're at this age..." He hurriedly replied: "This is not like joining the army, is there an age limit for swimming?" With that, he took off his clothes and jumped into the water with a splash.
	
	When the competition was about to end, Old Grandpa Tian Luosan and the young men walked ashore together, and everyone praised him: "This old man is really good!" Luosan said: "We'll see if I'm really good, anyway, I didn't fall behind you young people."
	
	A New Generation of Wild Goose Platoon
	The teachers of Baiyangdian Middle School and Elementary School, in order to let the students inherit and display the tenacious and resourceful water skills of the Wild Goose Platoon in fighting the Japanese devils, have established youth amateur sports schools in all eighty-three middle and elementary schools here since 1958. They organized students with a relatively good foundation in swimming to receive training in swimming, boating, and other aspects. The swimming team of the Baiyangdian Middle School amateur sports school is named "Wild Goose Platoon."
	
	The Party Committees of Baiyangdian and Xin'an Communes, in order to quickly launch a summer swimming movement and meet the needs of commune members to learn swimming techniques, transferred more than 200 male and female commune members with higher swimming skills from their respective production teams. They concentrated on production for seven days, and used their spare time after production to invite middle school physical education teachers to help them conduct theoretical and technical training in swimming. After these people completed their studies, they returned to the production teams as the backbone force for carrying out swimming activities in the countryside, and as swimming instructors for the majority of commune members.
	
	Commune Members are Healthy, Production Increases Daily
	Production in the Baiyangdian area is mainly based on fishing. In the past, there was a popular saying here: "Small wind reduces by half, big wind completely stops," meaning that when there was a small wind, fishing production would be reduced by half, and when there was a big wind, production would stop completely. Now, thanks to the development of sports such as swimming and boating, commune members have generally improved their swimming and boating skills. Therefore, the heroes put forward the slogan: "No wind, we work hard, small wind, we work harder, big wind, we work skillfully," and as a result, production has greatly increased. Because commune members regularly participate in swimming exercises, their physical fitness has generally improved, and the labor attendance rate has risen to 97%. Therefore, Baiyangdian Commune recently won the "Fishing Pioneer" red flag awarded by the municipal and county Party committees.

    白洋淀的游泳季节
    李树彬
    夏天，河北徐水县白洋淀的游泳季节到了。
    当你走到村里，可以听到在街头巷尾乘凉的老人和织席打箔的姑娘们，正在大谈游泳。一个群众性的夏季游泳运动，已经火热地在白洋淀开展起来了。
    淀边对手赛
    白洋淀公社党委，为了响应县委“今年夏季三十五万人参加游泳”的号召，发动了四万多人参加了游泳运动，并向全县各兄弟公社提出了“开展全民游泳活动，推动生产”的倡议，其中最主要的条件是：参加游泳活动的人数达到总人口的95％以上。新安公社也是靠近白洋淀的一个半水半陆的公社，刚参加全国文教群英会回来的苑金铎书记，当他接到来自白洋淀公社的倡议书以后，从头至尾详细地阅读了几遍，认为白洋淀公社游泳运动所以开展得好，是由于组织领导工作做得扎实，马上便派人去取经。取经回来以后，苑金铎同志亲自制订了方案，结合传达全国文教群英会精神，于6月20日也召开了一次七百多人的誓师大会。会后，还组织了一支宣传大军，村村写街头诗、画壁画，公社办起了“体育简报”介绍游泳经验……。一切准备工作就绪以后，苑金铎亲手与白洋淀公社的杨洪山书记发出了“友谊竞赛合同”，淀边两个公社的夏季游泳对手赛就这样开始了。
    流动跳水台
    县委为了提倡人们参加游泳运动，在全县范围内，充分利用1958年水利化以后的有利条件，开展了一个三十五万人参加的群众性的“渡河、过渠、越库、游淀闹龙宫”的夏季游泳运动高潮。而素以游泳闻名的白洋淀人民，在这一运动中更别具风味。为了满足群众的需要，村村因陋就简地建起了幼儿和成年人使用的跳水台、游泳池。为了更好地适应生产，让社员随时都能进行锻炼，大张庄、漾堤口等不少生产队还利用大“五舱”装置上了跳水台。每当社员下地插秧、治鱼时，他们就把装有跳水台的“五舱”划到生产前线。只要工间休息的哨声一响，一群年青的姑娘和小伙子们，便涌向了跳水台的附近，排成一条长蛇阵依次等待跳水。
    在封建社会里，这里的妇女整天是大门不出，二门不迈，参加游泳就更谈不到了。如今，由于这里群众性的游泳运动广泛深入地开展，80％以上的青年妇女参加了游泳的队伍。在最近（7月9日）保定地区举行的游泳运动大会上，白洋淀参加的十三名女运动员，就获得了三项第一。
    小两口比赛
    一天中午，烈日当头，从砦南生产队向村西游泳池去的街上，走着一男一女。男的是韩小胜，女的是刘小芬。他们夫妇俩结婚还不满三个月，可是自入夏以来，他俩每天劳动以后用过午饭，便一同去游泳池练习游泳。这天出门不远，小胜对小芬说：“7月1日公社要召开社员游泳运动大会，你怎么样？”“我早计划好了，那天也去参加。”小芬说。小胜只哼了一声，以为她不行。没等他往下说什么，小芬就听出话头来啦：“哼什么？我不行吗？别轻视人，不服今天我和你赛赛！”说着就走到了游泳池，夫妻俩就展开了一场紧张的游泳比赛。百米自由泳结束后，小芬比小胜只差一、二米，可她还不服气，又向小胜提出：“谁高谁低，明天再见！”
    淀上一家
    在白洋淀的中心，圈头生产队的游泳池里，可以经常看到一位白发苍苍的老人，这就是六十多岁的夏增祥老大爷。他家共有六口人，除老伴外，还有三个男孩一个女孩。真是老子英雄儿好汉，他的孩子在他的教导下，自小也都学会了游泳，并且都是游泳运动中的名将。他的大儿子夏章叩今年二十六岁，是二级游泳运动员，在1956年曾代表河北省参加了在上海举行的全国游泳运动会。在那次运动会上，他曾与闻名全国的穆氏一家比过高低。1958年7月8日，他的大儿子夏章叩、次子夏德顺曾代表保定专区参加了河北省的游泳运动会。在会上他们兄弟二人分别获得了男子自由泳、侧泳二百米、八百米、一千五百米比赛的第一名和第三名。他的三子夏德才和五岁的女儿夏淑芬也都是公社和县里有名的游泳运动员。由于他们一家人都会游泳，又屡次参加县、市、省里的游泳运动会，学得了一些游泳知识和技术，所以村里以他们为主组织起来了一个七十多人的游泳队。现在全部运动员利用业余时间也都学会了潜泳、侧泳、蛙泳。他们一家人被人们光荣地称为“淀上游泳之家”。
    幼儿和老人
    夏天的太阳像团烈火，把端村幼儿园和敬老院的幼儿和老人们热得不行。幼儿园的孩子们想到妈妈带着自己游泳的欢乐景象，便瞪着两个圆圆的眼睛向阿姨请求去游泳。阿姨带着他们到了游泳池，他们便像一个个小青蛙似地跳进了幼儿的浅水池。
    敬老院的老人，每当队里七天一小比、半月一大比的竞赛日快要到来的前夕，就担心自己的孩子在游泳比赛大会上落后于人。所以到了比赛的这天，敬老院的老人也都纷纷赶来，为自己的孩子参加游泳比赛助兴。田洛三老大爷年近七十，看到自己的孩子游到了别人的后边，便要脱衣服下水，当场有人说：“老大爷，这是个累人的事，你这个年纪……”他忙回答：“这又不是参军，难道游泳还有年龄的限制吗？”说着把衣服一扒，噗嗵一声就跳下水去。
    当比赛快要结束了，田洛三老大爷和小伙子们一起走上岸，大家都称赞他：“这老头，真行！”洛三说：“行不行走着瞧，反正没有落在你们年青人后边”。
    新一代的雁翎队
    白洋淀中学和小学的老师们，为了让学生们继承和施展出当年雁翎队打日本鬼子的顽强、机智的水上功夫，从1958年起，这里的八十三处中小学就都建立了青少年业余体育学校，把比较有游泳基础的同学组织起来，让他们受到游泳、划船等多方面的锻炼。白洋淀中学的业余体育学校的游泳队，就命名为“雁翎队”。
    白洋淀和新安公社的党委，为了尽快掀起夏季游泳运动高潮和满足社员们学习游泳技术的要求，分别从本公社所属生产队，调来了二百余名游泳技术较高的男女社员，以七天的时间集中生产，并利用生产后的业余时间，聘请中学的体育教师，帮助他们进行了游泳的理论和技术训练。这批人员学习期满后，回到生产队既是农村开展游泳运动的一批骨干力量，又是广大社员游泳的指导者。
    社员身体好  生产日日高
    白洋淀地区的生产，向以治鱼为主。过去，这里流行一句话：“小风减半，大风满完”，意思是说，遇到小风的时候，治鱼的生产就要减少一半，碰上大风的时候，生产就完全停顿。如今，由于游泳、划船等体育运动的开展，社员们普遍提高了游泳和划船技术水平。所以英雄们提出的口号是：“没风特干，小风大干，大风巧干”，结果生产大增。社员们由于经常参加游泳锻炼，体质也普遍增强，劳动出勤率上升到97％。因此，最近白洋淀公社还获得了市、县委奖给的“捕捞先锋”的大红旗。
