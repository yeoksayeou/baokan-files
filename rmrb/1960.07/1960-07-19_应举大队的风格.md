　　The Style of the Yingju Brigade
　　Liu Baolu
　　　　Friendship wheat ears thick and long,
　　　　Thanks to Yingju's help along,
　　　　Unity and friendship, great cooperation,
　　　　Happy life, boundless elation.
　　In the Nanfan Brigade, neighboring the Yingju Production Brigade of the Yingju Commune in Fengqiu County, Henan, a new folk song like this is circulating, praising the communist style of the Yingju Brigade.
　　Last September, the Yingju Brigade worked hard and skillfully, deep-plowing two thousand mu of wheat fields half a month ahead of schedule. At this time, the Nanfan Brigade was unable to complete the task of plowing due to the large task and lack of labor. Cui Ruogu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Yingju Brigade, led 150 crack troops, carrying tools, bedding, and dry rations, and marched mightily to Nanfan. As soon as they arrived in Nanfan, they divided into two groups, some pulling plows, some wielding shovels, and joined the Nanfan team members in a battle to plow the land.
　　On the third day, when Cui Ruogu and Zhang Juncai, the Party Branch Secretary of the Nanfan Brigade, were inspecting the quality of the plowing, they passed an area with severe saline-alkali soil. This area was as large as a hundred mu, with only sparse reeds growing in the field. Cui Ruogu asked Zhang Juncai, "Do you plan to plant wheat on this land this year?"
　　"I don't plan to," Zhang Juncai kicked the white powdery soil and said, "This is the kind of land where you lose two ladles for every gourd you plant."
　　Cui Ruogu said, "Yingju also has a lot of this kind of alkaline land. Let's plant wheat anyway! If you lack labor, we'll plow the land; if you're afraid of losing seeds, we'll take them out first, and you can return them after the wheat is harvested next year." Zhang Juncai agreed to his suggestion.
　　On the same day, the members of the Yingju team built and smoked fertilizer piles, building and smoking at the same time. During the day, clouds of smoke rose, and at night, there were fires everywhere. This was because it was chilly at night before planting wheat. The members of the Nanfan Brigade sent tea and food to the fields one after another, and even sent their quilts for the members of the Yingju team to cover. Three days passed, and the fertilizer was smoked black. It was estimated that each mu of land had 20,000 jin of base fertilizer. After the fertilizer was smoked, Cui Ruogu called on everyone: "Don't disarm, don't dismount! Let's apply fertilizer and deep-plow at the same time, and launch a major assault and competition!" As soon as the words fell, everyone started working. Seeing this situation, the members of the Nanfan Brigade immediately joined the battle. They chased each other and set off a competition craze. In less than a day, the hundred mu of saline-alkali land was completely transformed.
　　What if there is no moisture in the soil for sowing? Cui Ruogu thought: We must help the Nanfan Brigade fight drought and sow, and support them to the end. So they carried buckets and pots, and took out pit water, pond water, and well water to help the Nanfan Brigade plant wheat.
　　At the end of March this year, Cui Ruogu saw that the wheat was jointing and urgently needed water, but the waterwheel could only irrigate a few mu of land a day. Cui Ruogu found Zhang Juncai to discuss and decided to build a flatland reservoir.
　　On the day the work started, the Yingju Brigade sent another 200 strong men, still led by Comrade Cui Ruogu himself. As soon as they arrived, they fought side by side with the 170 members of the Nanfan team. Hou Guanyuan of the Yingju team broke his leg while digging soil, but he wrapped it with a towel and continued working. When others advised him to rest, he said: "I volunteered to support the brother team in building the reservoir. This little injury is nothing, I can't leave the front line." Such heroic actions appeared everywhere on the reservoir construction site. With the enthusiastic help of the Yingju team, the Nanfan team built the reservoir in three days and nights. To commemorate the assistance of the Yingju team, the reservoir was named "Friendship Reservoir."
　　Cui Ruogu and his team members were always concerned about the growth of wheat in the Nanfan team. When the summer wind blew across the fields, the wheat waves rolled in this field, a golden color.
　　On the day of the harvest, the members of both teams came to this field. Zhang Juncai, the Party Branch Secretary of the Nanfan Brigade, waved his sickle and cut the first handful of wheat. He held up the wheat bundle and said, "This wheat is no different from the wheat grown on our good land, with large ears and full grains. This is cultivated by the sweat and friendship of the Yingju members. The communist style of the Yingju team touches us and educates us. We must learn their style and drive, fight drought until the sky bows its head, and vow to win a bumper harvest for the whole year."
　　Cui Ruogu took the handful of wheat cut by Zhang Juncai, bent down and cut another handful, and then put the two handfuls of wheat together and said, "Chairman Mao said that unity is strength, and unity can lead to victory. In the future, may the members of our two teams be as closely united as this bundle of wheat." At this time, more than 500 members who participated in the rush harvest applauded and cheered enthusiastically. A female member of the Yingju team named Guo Meilan sang well: One person rich is not called rich, one team strong is not considered strong, the Party's teachings are kept in mind, the Yingju style is greatly promoted.

### 应举大队的风格

　　应举大队的风格
　　刘保禄
          友谊麦穗粗又长，　多亏应举来帮忙，
          团结友爱大协作，　幸福生活乐无疆。
    在河南封丘县应举公社应举生产大队近邻的南范大队，流传着这样一支新的歌谣，赞颂应举大队的共产主义风格。
    去年9月，应举大队大干巧干提前半个月深翻了二千亩麦田，这时南范大队由于任务大，劳力少，翻地任务不能完成。应举大队党支部书记崔若谷便率领着一百五十名精兵健将，带着工具、铺盖、干粮，浩浩荡荡地开到了南范。一到南范，他们就兵分两路，拉犁的拉犁，舞锨的舞锨，和南范队员一起展开了翻地大战。
    第三天，崔若谷同南范大队党支部书记张俊才一起去检查翻地质量时，路过一片盐碱上潮很严重的地区。这块地足有百亩，地里只长着一些稀疏的芦苇。崔若谷问张俊才：“这块地你们今年计划种麦吗？”
    “不打算种，”张俊才踢了一脚白粉似的土地说，“这是种一葫芦赔两瓢的地呀。”
    崔若谷说：“应举也有很多这种碱地，还是种上麦子吧！你们缺少劳力，我们来翻地；要是怕赔种子的话，我们先拿出来，明年收了麦子再还。”张俊才同意了他的建议。
    当天，应举队的社员们就垒熏肥堆，边垒边熏，白天是一股烟云袅袅上升，夜晚是一处处火苗。这是种麦前夕，入夜寒气袭人。南范大队的社员们纷纷往地里送茶送饭，把自己的被子也送来，让给应举队的社员们盖。三天过去，肥料熏得黑黑的，算计一下，每亩地足有两万斤底肥。熏好肥料，崔若谷号召大家：“兵不卸甲，将不下马，咱们要随施肥随深翻，开展大突击，大竞赛。”话刚落音，大家就干起来了。南范大队的社员们，看到这种情形，立刻也参加了战斗。你追我赶，掀起了竞赛热潮。一天没过去，百十亩盐碱地就来了个大翻身。
    要播种，地里没墒怎么办呢？崔若谷想：一定要帮助南范大队抗旱播种，支援到底。于是担桶的担桶，提罐的提罐，他们把坑水、塘水、井水都提了出来，帮助南范大队种上了小麦。
    今年3月底，崔若谷见小麦正在拔节，急需要水，而推水车一天却灌不了几亩地。崔若谷便找到张俊才商量，决定修个平地水库。
    动工那天，应举大队再次派来了二百名健将，仍由崔若谷同志亲自带领着。他们一开来，便和南范队的一百七十名社员并肩作战。应举队的侯贯元挖土时碰破了腿，他用毛巾一裹又干了起来。别人劝他休息，他说：“支援兄弟队修水库，是我自愿报名来的，这点小伤不算啥，不能下火线。”在水库工地，到处都出现了这种英雄的行动。在应举队的热情帮助下，南范队三个昼夜修成了水库，人们为了纪念应举队的援助，把这个水库起名叫“友谊水库”。
    崔若谷和他的队员们，时时刻刻关心着南范队小麦的成长。当夏天的风吹拂在田野上的时候，这块地里麦浪滚滚，一片金黄。
    开镰那天，两个队的社员们都来到这块地里。南范大队党支书张俊才挥舞镰刀，割下了第一把麦子。他高举麦束说：“这块麦子和我们的好地上长出的麦没有两样，穗大粒饱。这是应举社员们的血汗和友谊培养出来的。应举队的共产主义风格感动着我们，教育着我们，我们要学习他们的风格和干劲，抗旱抗到天低头，誓夺全年大丰收。”
    崔若谷接过来张俊才割下的那把小麦，又弯腰割了一把，然后把两把麦子合到一起说：“毛主席说，团结就是力量，能团结就能胜利；今后愿我们两队的社员像这捆麦子一样，紧紧地团结在一起。”这时五百多名参加抢收的社员们，都热烈地鼓掌欢呼。有个名叫郭美兰的应举队的女社员唱得好：一人富来不叫富，一队强来不算强，党的教导记心间，应举风格大发扬。
