    Supporting the Polish Government's Solemn Position

    Recently, the government of the Polish People's Republic sent a note to the governments of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, exposing with irrefutable facts their ugly acts of embellishing and defending West German militarism. In its note, the Polish government solemnly requested the governments of the countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty to state their attitude towards West Germany's intention to revise Poland's western border on the Oder-Neisse line. As everyone knows, the transfer of the old German territories east of the Oder-Neisse River to Poland was determined by the Potsdam Agreement signed by the anti-Hitler allies—the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France—after World War II, and it cannot be allowed to be arbitrarily revised. Our people fully support this solemn position of the Polish People's Republic and resolutely oppose any conspiracy and activity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in supporting West German militarism to revise the German-Polish border.

    West German militarism, fostered by U.S. imperialism, is becoming increasingly arrogant. It is not only stepping up its arms race, but also openly employing a large number of fascists. Various fascist organizations in West Germany have been revived. Especially recently, the activities of fascist organizations have been rampant. Some so-called "refugee groups" and "East Prussian Compatriot Associations" have held revanchist rallies one after another, clamoring for so-called "freedom, the right to homeland, and self-determination," and provoking Poland and Czechoslovakia. Adenauer has also vigorously advocated the Cold War and carried out revanchist agitation. At a recent meeting of the revanchist organization "East Prussian Compatriot Association," in addition to vigorously clamoring for strengthening the military power of the North Atlantic Group, he also disregarded historical facts and nonsensically claimed that "East Prussia has been German territory for more than 700 years," and that "the eastern regions of Germany have been annexed," clamoring that "one day East Prussia will become free again." This Cold War clamor clearly demonstrates the West German militarism's conspiracy to tear up the Potsdam Agreement and its ambition to invade Poland and expand its territory. This is a serious provocation by West German militarism to European and world peace. This naturally aroused the high vigilance and strong condemnation of the Polish and Czechoslovak peoples. Therefore, the Polish government's note to the governments of the North Atlantic Group countries and the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on West Germany's new revanchist provocations not long ago have received the active support of peace-loving people all over the world.

    The revival of West German militarism is the result of U.S. imperialism's "careful management." In order to realize its ambition to enslave the world, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, frantically expands its arms race and prepares for war, and on the other hand, it tries its best to arm West Germany and Japan, vainly attempting to raise the West German and Japanese ruling groups into tools for it to control and invade Eurasia. Recently, U.S. and West German military leaders held talks to further plan to equip the West German army with U.S. intermediate-range ballistic missiles through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. U.S. imperialism also plans to hand over U.S. "Polaris" nuclear missiles to West Germany and help West Germany build 1,000-ton nuclear submarines and 5,000-ton destroyers capable of launching nuclear missiles. These facts once again prove that U.S. imperialism is the culprit in making West Germany a source of war and the number one enemy of the people of the world.

    West German revanchists are issuing war cries more and more frantically, and are expressing their ambitions to seize the territories of Poland and Czechoslovakia more and more nakedly. This is a serious threat to European and world peace, especially to the interests of the people of countries neighboring West Germany. The Polish government's solemn position on the German-Polish border issue is in line with the interests of European security and world peace. Vice Premier Chen Yi stated at the reception held by the Polish Ambassador to China, Knothe, on July 22 to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the National Day of the Polish People's Republic: "The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the Polish government's solemn position on the western border issue. We have always believed that the Oder-Neisse River border is the final border and should never be allowed to be changed. Anyone who dares to invade and provoke the Polish People's Republic will surely be smashed to pieces under the unanimous and resolute counterattack of the entire socialist camp." We firmly believe that under the resolute opposition of the Polish people and the united counterattack of the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world, the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism and West German revanchists will surely meet with shameful failure.

### 支持波兰政府的严正立场

    支持波兰政府的严正立场
    最近，波兰人民共和国政府向北大西洋公约组织参加国政府发出照会，以无可置辩的事实，揭发了它们为西德军国主义粉饰和辩护的丑态。波兰政府在照会中严正地要求参加北大西洋公约的各国政府，说明它们对西德打算修改波兰在奥得—尼斯河的西部边界所抱的态度。大家知道，奥得—尼斯河以东的旧德国地区划归波兰，是第二次世界大战后，由反希特勒的同盟国——苏联、英国、美国和法国所签订的波茨坦协定决定的，不能容许任意修改。我国人民完全支持波兰人民共和国的这种严正的立场，坚决反对北大西洋公约集团支持西德军国主义修改德波边界的任何阴谋和活动。
    由美帝国主义一手扶植起来的西德军国主义日益跋扈。它不仅加紧备战，而且公开起用大批法西斯分子。西德的各种法西斯组织复活了，特别在最近，法西斯组织的活动十分猖獗，一些所谓“难民团体”和“东普鲁士同乡会”，纷纷举行复仇主义集会，叫嚣什么要争取所谓“自由、家乡权和自决权”，向波兰和捷克斯洛伐克挑衅。阿登纳也大肆鼓吹冷战，进行复仇主义的煽动，他在复仇主义组织“东普鲁士同乡会”最近举行的集会上，除了极力叫嚣要加强北大西洋集团的军事力量以外，还不顾历史事实，胡说什么“东普鲁士七百多年以来就是德国的领土”，“德国东部地区被吞并”之类鬼话，叫嚷“总有一天东普鲁士又会成为自由的”。这种冷战叫嚣清楚地表明了西德军国主义企图撕毁波茨坦协定的阴谋和向波兰进行侵略和扩张领土的野心。这是西德军国主义对欧洲和世界和平的严重挑衅。这自然特别引起波兰人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民的高度警惕和强烈谴责。所以波兰政府给北大西洋集团各国政府的照会和不久以前捷克斯洛伐克外交部发表的关于西德新的复仇主义挑衅的声明，都得到全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持。
    西德军国主义的复活，是美帝国主义“苦心经营”的结果。美帝国主义为了实现它奴役世界的野心，一方面疯狂地扩军备战，另一方面竭力武装西德和日本，妄想把西德和日本统治集团豢养成它控制和侵略欧亚的工具。最近，美国和西德军事头目会谈，进一步策划通过北大西洋公约集团用美国中程弹道导弹装备西德军队，美帝国主义还计划把美国的“北极星”式核导弹交给西德，并且帮助西德建造一千吨的核潜艇和能发射核导弹的五千吨的驱逐舰，这些事实再一次证明，美帝国主义是使西德成为战争策源地的罪魁祸首，是全世界人民的头号敌人。
    西德复仇主义者越来越疯狂地发出战争叫嚣，越来越露骨地表示出侵占波兰和捷克斯洛伐克领土的野心，这是对欧洲和世界和平的严重威胁，特别是对与西德相邻国家人民的利益的严重威胁。波兰政府对德波边界问题的严正立场，是符合欧洲安全和世界和平的利益的。陈毅副总理7月22日在波兰驻中国大使克诺泰举行的庆祝波兰人民共和国国庆十六周年的招待会上宣称：“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持波兰政府关于西部边界问题的严正立场。我们一向认为奥得—尼斯河边界是最后的边界，是绝不容许加以改变的。任何人如果敢于向波兰人民共和国进行侵略和挑衅，它就一定会在社会主义阵营全体一致的坚决回击下碰得头破血流。”我们深信，在波兰人民的坚决反对下，在社会主义各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的联合反击下，美帝国主义和西德复仇主义者的侵略阴谋一定会遭到可耻的失败。
