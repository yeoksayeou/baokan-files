Xinhua News Agency report: The broad masses of art workers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and fully developing the fine tradition of "facing the companies and serving the soldiers," have gone deep into the heat of struggle, achieving a double harvest in ideological remolding and artistic creation, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of officers and soldiers.

In recent years, many art troupes, in their performance work, have adopted a combination of large, medium, and small forms, going deep into the companies, "delivering performances to the door," and doing everything possible to meet the needs of the troops for cultural and artistic life. The Frontline Drama Troupe, under the slogan of "facing the companies, being in the companies, having their hearts in the companies, running all over the companies, performing for the companies, and teaching the companies," performed 1,288 shows for the troops in 1958 alone, an average of three and a half shows per day. When the Inner Mongolia Military Region Art Troupe went to a certain place for a performance, they heard that five soldiers guarding a bridge could not come to see the show, so they went to the bridgehead to organize an evening party for these five audience members, and even sent actors to replace the soldiers on guard duty and direct traffic. The Tibet Military Region Art Troupe has been active on the snowy plateau for a long time this year. They said that performing for the soldiers on the highest stage in the world is a great honor for art soldiers.

Whenever art soldiers from various military regions arrive at a unit, they also collect the heroic deeds of the officers and soldiers of that unit, composing and performing them on the spot, inspiring the fighting will of the troops, helping soldiers learn culture, and tutoring amateur art activities.

The cultivation of this excellent style of the art troupes of the People's Liberation Army is the result of the Party committees at all levels of the military strengthening their leadership over art work, resolutely implementing the Party's general line and art policy in art work, and it is also the result of the broad masses of art workers adhering to going deep into reality and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Since 1958, the art troupes of various military regions have resolutely implemented the Party's instructions on sending people down for training. Whether they are creators or performers, they must spend a certain amount of time each year in the companies as soldiers, going deep into the countryside and factories to participate in physical labor. In the long-term process of eating, living, working, and fighting together with soldiers and workers and peasants, the ideological feelings of most art soldiers have undergone significant changes, their class consciousness has been raised, their mass viewpoint and labor viewpoint have been strengthened, and their feelings for workers, peasants, and soldiers have been initially established. As a result, the great leap forward in thinking has driven the great leap forward in art.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 24th: Lhasa's art troupes are going deep into the rural and pastoral areas to perform various programs for the broad masses of emancipated serfs and herdsmen, enlivening the cultural life of the working people in various places.

Recently, the Tibet Song and Dance Troupe, the Tibetan Opera Troupe, the Sichuan Opera Troupe, the Huangmei Opera Troupe, the Qin Opera Troupe, and the Lhasa City Youth Women's Federation Song and Dance Team, as well as amateur performance teams organized by residents of various districts in Lhasa, and more than a dozen other art troupes, brought more than 120 wonderful programs to the rural and pastoral areas and major towns of Lhasa City and Shannan, Naqu, Gyangze, and Nyingchi Prefectures to perform, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the working people in various places. Many farmers and herdsmen rode horses, crossed mountains and ridges, and came from far away to watch the performances, and also presented hadas expressing their gratitude to the actors. The troupes have now performed more than 340 shows, with an audience of more than 300,000 people.

In their performances, the art troupes used rich and colorful national forms to reflect the new situation in the political, economic, cultural, and other aspects of the Tibet region after the democratic reforms, under the leadership of the Party, as well as the happy life of the Tibetan people after their emancipation. Among them are "Song of the Slaves," which reflects the emancipation of millions of serfs in Tibet and their becoming masters of their own destiny, "Blood and Tears of Hatred," which condemns the evils of the feudal serf system, "Happy Tibetan People," "Night of Harvest," and "My Home," which praise the happy life of emancipated peasants, "The Red Flag is Planted on Mount Everest," which reflects the heroic deeds of Chinese mountaineers, and "The Communist Party's Kindness is Long," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and so on, which reflect the Tibetan people's infinite love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    解放军文艺工作者深入连队
    拉萨文艺团体到基层为翻身农牧民演出
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军广大文艺工作者，高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，充分发扬“面向连队为兵服务”的优良传统，深入火热的斗争，获得了思想改造、文艺创作双丰收，受到部队广大官兵的热烈欢迎。
    几年来，许多文艺团体在演出工作中，采取大中小相结合的形式，深入连队、“送戏上门”，千方百计地满足部队对文艺生活的需要。前线话剧团在“面向连队，身在连队，心在连队，跑遍连队，演给连队，教给连队”的口号下，1958年一年，就为部队演出了一千二百八十八场，平均每天三场半。内蒙古部队文工团在去某地慰问演出时，听说有五个守桥的战士不能来看，他们就开赴桥头为这五个观众组织晚会，并且派演员代替战士站岗、指挥交通。西藏部队文工团今年以来长期活跃在风雪高原。他们说，在世界最高的舞台上为战士们演出，是文艺战士极大的光荣。
    各部队文艺战士们每到一个部队，还收集这个部队官兵的英雄事迹，即编即演，鼓舞部队的战斗意志。帮助战士学文化和辅导业余文艺活动。
    人民解放军各部队文艺团体这种优良作风的养成，是部队各级党委加强了对文艺工作的领导，在文艺工作中坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和党的文艺方针的结果，也是广大文艺工作者坚持深入实际和工农兵相结合的结果。1958年以来，各部队文艺团体坚决执行了党的下放锻炼的指示。不论创作人员或者是演出人员，每年都要有一定时间下连队当兵，深入农村、工厂参加体力劳动。文艺战士们在长期和士兵以及工农群众同吃同住同劳动同战斗中，绝大部分人思想感情起了显著变化，阶级觉悟提高了，群众观念和劳动观念加强了，和工农兵的感情初步建立起来了。结果，思想的大跃进带动了艺术的大跃进。
    新华社拉萨24日电　拉萨各文艺团体深入农村牧区，为广大翻身农牧民演出各种节目，活跃了各地劳动人民的文化生活。
    最近以来西藏歌舞团、藏剧队、川剧团、黄梅剧团、秦剧团和拉萨市青妇联歌舞队，拉萨市各城区居民组织的业余演出队等十几个文艺团体，带了一百二十多个精彩节目，到拉萨市和山南、那曲、江孜、林芝等专区的农村、牧区和主要城镇演出，受到了各地广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎，许多农牧民骑着马，翻山越岭，从很远的地方赶来看戏，还把表示感谢的哈达献给演员们。现在各剧团已经演出了三百四十多场，观众达三十多万人次。
    各文艺团体在演出中用丰富多彩的民族形式，反映了西藏地区民主改革后，在党的领导下，政治、经济、文化等各方面的崭新景象，以及藏族人民翻身后的幸福生活。其中有反映西藏百万农奴翻身作主人的“奴隶之歌”，控诉封建农奴制度罪恶的“血泪仇”，有歌颂翻身农民幸福生活的“欢乐的西藏人民”、“丰收之夜”、“我的家”，有反映我国登山队员的英雄事迹的“红旗插上了珠穆朗玛峰”以及反映藏族人民对共产党和毛主席无限热爱的“共产党恩情长”、“毛主席万寿无疆”等等。
