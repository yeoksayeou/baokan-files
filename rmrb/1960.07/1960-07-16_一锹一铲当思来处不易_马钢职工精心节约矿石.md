　　Every Shovel and Spade Should Remind Us of its Hard-Won Origin
　　Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Workers Carefully Conserve Ore
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th — While vigorously increasing ore production and transportation, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in Anhui Province is also vigorously conserving ore usage, significantly reducing ore consumption. In June, the average ore consumption per ton of iron produced by the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant decreased by 93 kilograms compared to May.
    The Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Party Committees of each iron smelting plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel attach great importance to conserving ore and using it rationally. The Municipal Party Committee, the Company, and each iron plant have established a "three grasps a day" system, conducting three inspections of raw material work every day, in the morning, noon, and evening, to promptly identify and resolve problems. Each iron plant has a Party Secretary and a Factory Director personally in charge of the organization, scheduling, and supply of raw materials, spending most of their time directly commanding operations at the raw material site. Simultaneously, each iron smelting plant has established a raw material workshop, and each iron smelting workshop has established a raw material work section, strengthening the scheduling and management of raw materials at all levels, and establishing a scientific management system. After the ore enters the plant, the raw material workshop unloads and stockpiles it separately according to different varieties and specifications. When using raw materials, blast furnaces not only fix the materials used according to variety but also conduct chemical analysis before charging the furnace, allocating materials according to their composition. This ensures both the required composition of the ore entering the furnace and the rational use of the ore.
    In order to improve the ore utilization rate and further use ore rationally, each iron smelting plant has established a rational ore usage system of supplying ore based on furnace needs. Based on the particle size of the ore entering the plant, it is divided into three grades and supplied to large, medium, and small blast furnaces respectively. Off-grade crushed ore and ore powder are recovered by the recovery group of each raw material work section and transported to the sintering workshop to sinter the sinter, or used directly in blast furnaces for iron smelting by means of indigenous sintering. In this way, all the ore and ore powder mined from the mine are rationally used.
    Actively improving raw material processing, achieving "processing coarse grains finely" and "charging refined materials into the furnace," is an important measure for increasing the production of more high-quality pig iron with less ore. Each iron smelting plant vigorously engages in ore screening, washing, and sorting work, resolutely preventing mud, waste rock, and other impurities from entering the furnace. In cases where washing and sorting equipment cannot fully meet production needs, indigenous screening methods are vigorously promoted, manufacturing semi-mechanized equipment combining foreign and indigenous methods, and actively improving the ore grade.

### 一锹一铲当思来处不易　马钢职工精心节约矿石

　　一锹一铲当思来处不易
　　马钢职工精心节约矿石
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省马鞍山钢铁公司在狠抓矿石增产与调运的同时，狠抓节约用矿，使矿石的消耗量显著下降。炼铁一厂6月份平均每炼一吨铁的矿石消耗，比5月份降低九十三公斤。
    马鞍山市委和马钢各炼铁厂党委对节约矿石、合理用矿极为重视。市委、公司和各铁厂建立了一天三抓的制度，每天早中晚对原料工作进行三次检查，及时发现和解决问题。各铁厂都由一个党委书记和厂长亲自掌握原料的组织调度供应工作，以绝大部分时间直接在原料场地指挥。同时，各炼铁厂都建立了原料车间，各炼铁车间又都建立了原料工段，层层加强原料的调度和管理工作，并且建立了一套科学的管理制度。原料车间在矿石进厂后，即按照不同品种和不同规格，分别卸车堆存。高炉在使用原料时，除按品种固定用料外，并在入炉前作好化验分析，按成分配料入炉，既保证了入炉矿石应有的成份，又合理地使用了矿石。
    为了提高矿石利用率，进一步合理用矿，各炼铁厂均建立了因炉供矿的合理用矿制度。根据进厂矿石粒度大小分为三级，分别供应给大中小高炉。等外碎矿和矿粉由各原料工段的回收组负责回收，调运到烧结车间烧炼烧结矿，或就高炉搞土烧结矿直接用于高炉炼铁。这样，从矿山开采出的全部矿石、矿粉都得到了合理使用。
    积极改善原料处理，做到粗粮细作，精料入炉，是用较少的矿石增产更多优质生铁的重要措施。各炼铁厂大搞矿石筛、洗、选工作，坚决不让泥巴、废石等杂质入炉。在洗选设备尚不能全部满足生产需要的情况下，大搞土法筛选，制造洋土结合的半机械化设备，积极提高矿石品位。
