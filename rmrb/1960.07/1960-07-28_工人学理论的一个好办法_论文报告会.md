A Good Way for Workers to Learn Theory - Paper Presentation Conference
Secretary of the CPC Beijing Railway Bureau Committee Zhao Wenpu

Under the new situation of the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the sustained leap forward in socialist construction in our country, the broad masses of workers and staff of the Beijing Railway Bureau, like all regions and departments across the country, have launched a mass movement to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong. At present, more than 8,000 study groups have been established in all units under the bureau, with more than 130,000 people participating in the study. A team of 9,000 part-time and full-time worker lecturers and instructors has been established, forming a theoretical education network that is both vertical and horizontal. Thanks to the lofty communist spirit and the down-to-earth and assiduous study of the broad masses of workers, this movement has achieved remarkable results. The broad masses of workers are not only able to learn and speak about theory, but also creatively apply theory to analyze and solve problems in production, promoting the development of production. At the same time, many workers are also writing articles. From January to the present year, employees of the bureau have written more than 130,000 papers, of which 78 have been published in central and local newspapers and periodicals. These articles either summarize the experience in the work, promote advanced ideas and advanced deeds, or oppose and criticize incorrect ideas and behaviors, transforming their subjective world while transforming the objective world. In short, the scope, number of people, enthusiasm, and effectiveness of the theoretical study movement of the Beijing Railway Bureau are all unprecedented. A great new situation has emerged on the ideological and theoretical front of the Party.

The mass movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong is not only a movement for the great popularization of Marxist-Leninist theory, but also a movement for the masses to consciously carry out ideological revolution. Therefore, this is an extremely serious and arduous political task currently facing Party organizations. According to the experience of the Beijing Railway Bureau, Party organizations at all levels must strengthen the ideological and organizational leadership of this study movement, adhere to the policy of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and vigorously carrying out mass movements in order to enable this movement to develop rapidly and healthily. In the process of vigorously carrying out mass movements, according to different situations and conditions, creating various flexible and applicable learning methods and ways, achieving learning and application at the same time, learning while applying, and combining learning and application, that is, implementing the principle of combining learning theory with transforming the objective world and the subjective world, is also an important reason why this movement can achieve success and be continuously consolidated and improved. Recently, in order to review and promote achievements and exchange experiences, the Beijing Railway Bureau Party Committee convened a bureau-wide worker paper presentation conference in Tianjin. More than 50 worker papers and more than 10 summaries of learning experiences were read at the meeting. These papers and summaries of experiences repeatedly demonstrated that the above practices are correct and effective.

Here, I would like to focus on introducing the paper presentation conference, a learning form that studies theory, improves understanding, writes articles, and guides practice. Since the beginning of this year, the Beijing Railway Bureau Party Committee has convened two bureau-wide paper presentation conferences, which have greatly promoted the learning movement. At present, this form has been widely adopted by all grassroots units in the bureau and has formed a system. In grassroots units, the general practice is to focus on the main problems in production and work, combined with the ideological situation of the workers, the Party committee puts forward topics, everyone starts to work, conducts investigations and researches, writes articles, and then holds a report meeting, where the masses speak, the masses listen, the masses analyze, and the masses discuss, in order to achieve a common understanding and better solve production problems and ideological problems. The workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau call this method of mass voicing opinions, mass airing of views, and mass debate, and collective creation the "dragon head swings and the dragon tail wags" "one-dragon" paper presentation conference. Practice has proven that this kind of report meeting is a good way for the masses to implement the integration of theory and practice and realize the formula of "practice - knowledge - practice."

The paper presentation conference held by the Fengtai Locomotive Depot not long ago, focusing on the topic of how to save coal, is a vivid example. At the beginning of this year, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot Party Committee put forward a leap forward target for saving coal based on the advanced locomotive coal consumption standard, which was welcomed and supported by the broad masses of workers. However, it also aroused some discussions. Some seemingly knowledgeable people said: "The increase in the number of coal savings is unfounded and simply impossible." Others said: "In previous years, coal savings were 7% to 8%. This year's coal saving target is too big a step." Because of the existence of these ideas, some crew members who could not complete the plan simply emphasized objective difficulties and did not seriously check the reasons for excessive coal consumption, saying that coal could not be saved on windy days, that inferior coal could not be saved, that poor operating conditions could not be saved, and so on. This kind of "conditionalism" not only directly affected the completion of the coal saving plan, but also resulted in an excess consumption of 87 tons of coal in early May. In order to solve this problem, the Party Committee of the depot took the lead and organized an investigation and research group composed of workshop branch secretaries, worker lecturers, and learning backbones to conduct in-depth investigation and research on the front line of production. From May 1st to 16th this year, they analyzed more than 100 locomotives and found that the coal consumption of each locomotive varied greatly. The same type of locomotive running on the same line saved more than 20 tons of coal in 16 days, while some consumed more than 20 tons of coal. In addition, the work of some auxiliary departments (laboratory, repair shop, fuel plant, statistics room) could not meet the requirements of coal saving targets. After such investigation and research, the main reasons for the failure to complete the coal saving plan were found: the crew members of the coal consuming teams had not yet mastered the laws of coal saving, especially the "conditionalism" in the crew members, and the subjective initiative of people had not been brought into play. Therefore, the coal saved by the coal-saving locomotives was not enough to cover the coal consumed by the coal-consuming locomotives. After finding the main reason, the Party Committee of the depot further mobilized the masses to summarize experience and analyze the laws of coal saving. At the same time, it also organized a three-in-one investigation and research group consisting of cadres, technicians, and worker lecturers to follow the shifts and summarize the experience of the Construction Type 5034 locomotive group in using Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic thinking - concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles - under the circumstances of windy weather and poor operating conditions, with ambush in front and pursuit in the rear (that is, trains in front and behind); How the Heping Type 1008 locomotive group grasped the characteristics of large locomotives and went from coal consumption to coal saving; How the Jiefang Type 2292 locomotive group analyzed and studied the driving laws of the Fengzhang Line with many tunnels, large slopes, and small curve radii, saving coal by crossing mountains and ridges. After this kind of mass investigation and research and mass summarization of experience, everyone started to write articles, and more than 300 papers were written. The Party Committee of the depot selected eight papers with typical significance from them and held a depot-wide paper presentation conference, launching a mass voicing opinions, mass airing of views, and mass debate. As a result, the crew members deeply realized that the decisive factor in saving or consuming coal is people, not locomotives, and that poor conditions can be changed by giving full play to subjective initiative. Therefore, after the paper presentation conference, each chartered train group immediately held a meeting to study the reasons for coal consumption and find and master the laws of coal saving. Therefore, the depot quickly turned from coal consumption to coal saving, from consuming 89 tons of coal in the first ten days of May to saving 520 tons of coal by the end of the month, and saving 889 tons of coal in June.

The paper presentation conference held by the Fengtai Locomotive Depot is both theoretical and practical, both a theoretical meeting and an on-site meeting for exchanging experiences. This practice of combining learning, production, and writing articles into one rope, that is, leading and planning to combine with production practice, extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses to investigate and research, raising rich experience to theory for analysis and summary, thereby promoting production and work to move forward, is worthy of promotion. Such a paper presentation conference is a process of mass seeking truth from facts. Chairman Mao told us in "On Practice": "Through practice, discover the truth, and through practice, verify the truth and develop the truth. From perceptual knowledge to actively develop to rational knowledge, and from rational knowledge to actively guide revolutionary practice, transform the subjective world and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this form, cycles repeatedly to infinity, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge has relatively reached a higher level." The form of the worker paper presentation conference not only vividly and actively solves the relationship between knowledge and practice that Chairman Mao said, but what is especially valuable is that it involves all the masses, regardless of the level of theory, technology, and culture, in the process of "practice - knowledge - practice." Anyone who can write can write, and anyone who can comment can comment. Everyone has the right to speak, and everyone can give full play to their wisdom. In this way, people's understanding is based on occupying a large amount of materials and rich experience, and after analysis and improvement, from individual to general, from concrete to abstract, from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, realizing the essence of things and the laws of development and change of things. Therefore, the process of everyone writing articles and holding paper presentation conferences is the process of deepening people's understanding of the regularity of objective things, and it is also the process of coming from the masses and going to the masses. And with the continuous practice of the masses, continuously conducting investigation and research, analysis and thinking, and summarizing and improving, our subjective understanding can continuously conform to objective reality. In this way, our production and work can always maintain initiative and high-speed leap forward.

The process of the masses writing, speaking, listening, and discussing is the process of self-education of the masses, and it is also a new and effective method for the Party to carry out political and ideological work. The masses participating in the paper presentation conference learn theory in the debate with reality and comparison, and can also solve their own ideological understanding problems from the theoretical point of view and improve their ideological awareness. In the above-mentioned Fengtai Locomotive Depot's coal saving paper presentation conference, many locomotive groups checked the idea of "conditionalism" after the meeting and established the idea of giving full play to subjective initiative and that man will conquer nature. Employees in some auxiliary departments, from crew members to repair workers, from inspectors to technicians, from statisticians to fuel coal workers, also realized the principle that things are interconnected and mutually restrictive through writing articles and discussing articles, and further realized the relationship between themselves and coal saving, the relationship between their work and the whole, and the relationship between their work and various departments, and actively invested in the battle to seize coal. In the early days of realizing loading and unloading mechanization, the Tangshan Station only achieved 10% efficiency. As a result, some people had doubts and attempted to go backwards. In response to this ideological problem, the Party General Branch of the station organized all employees to study the quotations of "How Marxists Treat New Things" and mobilized workers to write articles to discuss how to break through the use barrier. The paper written by worker Wu Lian said that to overcome the use barrier, we must first overcome the ideological conservatism barrier, break old habits and old conventions, and continuously improve the loading and unloading machinery with the spirit of continuous revolution. The Party General Branch of the station seized this paper to hold a paper presentation conference and used it as a lecture in the workers, which greatly inspired the workers. Many workers expressed that they would be continuous revolutionaries, promoters, not procrastinators, and not take the backward road. When the ideological problem was solved, the efficiency of using loading and unloading machinery quickly increased to 80%. Practice has proven that this form of paper presentation conference has developed the political and ideological work methods of mass voicing opinions, mass airing of views, big-character posters, and great debate, and has raised the "four great" working methods to a higher level in terms of both content and form, adding a theoretical color.

In short, the paper presentation conference is a good way for the broad masses of workers to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong. We have realized that combining learning, production, and writing articles into one rope can not only quickly and universally improve the theoretical level and ideological awareness of workers and promote the continuous leap forward in production, but also improve the writing level of workers. At present, many writing activists have emerged. Universally promoting this learning method will undoubtedly rapidly cultivate a group of working-class "red talents" who have both rich practical experience and a certain theoretical level and can write and speak well.

    工人学理论的一个好办法——论文报告会
    中共北京铁路局委员会书记　赵文普
    在我国社会主义革命不断深入、社会主义建设持续跃进的新形势下，北京铁路局广大职工，同全国各地区各部门一样，掀起了一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的群众运动。目前全局所属各单位已经建立了八千个学习小组，参加学习的有十三万多人，并且已经建立了一支由九千人组成的兼职和专职的工人讲师和辅导员队伍，形成一套纵横交织的理论教育网。由于广大职工发扬了高屋建瓴的共产主义风格，踏实刻苦地学习，这一运动已取得了显著的成绩。广大工人群众不但能够学理论、讲理论，而且能够创造性地应用理论来分析和解决生产中的问题，推动生产的发展。同时也有不少工人大写文章。从今年1月到现在，全局职工已写了十三万多篇论文，其中有七十八篇已在中央和地方的报刊上发表。这些文章，或者总结了工作中的经验，发扬了先进思想和先进事迹，或者反对和批判了不正确的思想和行为，在改造客观世界的同时，也改造了自己的主观世界。总之，北京铁路局理论学习运动的范围之广，人数之多，热情之高，效果之好，都是前所未见的。在党的思想理论战线上，出现了一派大好的新形势。
    学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的群众运动，既是马克思列宁主义理论大普及的运动，也是群众自觉地进行思想革命的运动。因此这是当前党组织所面临的一项极为严肃而艰巨的政治任务。根据北京铁路局的经验，各级党组织必须加强对这一学习运动的思想领导和组织领导，坚持相信群众，依靠群众，大搞群众运动的方针，才能使这一运动迅速而健康地开展起来。在大搞群众运动的过程中，根据不同的情况和条件，创造各种各样灵活适用的学习方式和方法，做到边学边用，边用边学，学用结合，即贯彻学习理论同改造客观世界和主观世界相结合的原则，也是使这一运动能够取得成就并不断得到巩固和提高的一个重要原因。最近，北京铁路局党委为了检阅和发扬成绩，交流经验，在天津召开了一次全局性的工人论文报告会。会上宣读了五十多篇工人论文和十几篇学习经验总结。这些论文和经验总结，都一再说明了上述做法是正确的和行之有效的。
    在这里，我想着重介绍一下论文报告会这一学习理论、提高认识、大写文章、指导实践的学习形式。今年以来，北京铁路局党委已召开了两次全局性的论文报告会，对学习运动起了巨大的推动作用。目前这一形式已为全局各基层单位广泛采用，并已形成了一种制度。在基层单位，一般的做法是，针对生产和工作上的主要问题，结合职工的思想情况，由党委出题目，人人动手，进行调查研究，写出文章，然后举行报告会，群众讲，群众听，群众分析，群众议论，以达到共同提高认识，更好地解决生产问题和思想问题的目的。北京铁路局的工人把这种大鸣大放大辩论的、集体创作的方法，叫做“龙头一摆龙尾摇”的“一条龙”论文报告会。实践证明，这种报告会是群众性的贯彻理论联系实际，实现“实践——认识——实践”这一公式的好办法。
    丰台机务段前不久举行的以如何节约煤为中心议题的论文报告会，就是一个生动的例证。丰台机务段党委在今年年初，根据先进机车耗煤标准，提出了节约煤的跃进指标，得到广大工人群众的欢迎和拥护。但是也引起了一些议论，一些似乎内行的人说：“节约煤的数字增加这么多，是没有根据的，根本办不到。”也有人说：“往年节约煤7％到8％，今年节约煤的指标，步子迈得太大了。”由于有这样一些思想存在，所以一些完不成计划的乘务员，便单纯强调客观困难，不认真检查多费煤的原因，说什么大风天不能节约，烧劣质煤不能节约，运行条件不好不能节约等等。这种“唯条件论”的思想，不仅直接影响完成节约煤的计划，而且在5月上旬反而多费了八十七吨煤。该段党委为了解决这个问题，便由党委书记挂帅，组织了一个由车间支部书记、工人讲师、学习骨干参加的调查研究小组，深入生产第一线进行调查研究。从今年5月1日至16日，他们对一百多台机车进行了分析，发现各台机车用煤悬殊，同一种类型的机车在同一条线路上行驶，在十六天中有的省煤二十多吨，有的却多费煤二十多吨。此外，一些辅助部门（化验室、检修车间、燃料厂、统计室）的工作，也不能适应节约煤指标的要求。经过这样的调查研究，找出了不能完成节约煤的计划的主要原因是：费煤班组的乘务员还没有掌握节约煤的规律，特别是在乘务员中存在着“唯条件论”的思想，人的主观能动性就没有发挥出来，因此省煤机车省的煤，还不够费煤机车所费的煤。主要原因找到了，该段党委又进一步发动群众总结经验，分析节约煤的规律。同时，还组织了由干部、技术员、工人讲师三结合的调查研究小组，一边跟班劳动，一边总结了建设型5034号机车组在大风天运行条件不好、前有埋伏后有追兵（即前后有列车）的情况下，运用毛泽东同志的战略思想——集中优势兵力，打歼灭战，而取得胜利的经验；和平型1008号机车组如何掌握大型机车的特点，由费煤到省煤的经验；解放型2292号机车组如何分析研究山洞多、坡道大、曲线半径小的丰张线的行车规律，穿山越岭节约煤炭的经验。经过这种群众性的调查研究，群众性的总结经验，于是大家动手写文章，写出了论文三百余篇。该段党委从中选择了具有典型意义的论文八篇，举行了全段的论文报告会，展开了大鸣大放大辩论。这样一来，乘务员们深刻体会到省煤或费煤的决定因素是人而不是机车，条件不好是可以通过发挥主观能动性加以改变的。于是在论文报告会后，各包车组立即开会研究费煤原因，寻找和掌握节约煤的规律。因此该段很快由费煤转为省煤，5月份由上旬费煤八十九吨变为到月底省煤五百二十吨，6月份省煤八百八十九吨。
    像丰台机务段举行的这种论文报告会，既有理论，又有实际，既是理论会，又是交流经验的现场会议。这种把学习、生产、写文章三者结合起来的做法，即有领导有计划地结合生产实践，广泛深入地发动群众调查研究，把丰富的经验提到理论上加以分析和总结，从而推动生产和工作向前发展的做法，是值得提倡的。这样的论文报告会，是群众性的实事求是的过程。毛主席在《实践论》中告诉我们：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。从感性认识而能动地发展到理性认识，又从理性认识而能动地指导革命实践，改造主观世界和客观世界。实践，认识，再实践，再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”工人论文报告会这一形式，不仅生动活泼地解决了毛主席所说的这种认识与实践的关系，而尤其可贵的是，它使所有的群众，不管理论、技术、文化水平的高低，都卷入到“实践——认识——实践”的过程中来，能写就写，能评就评，大家都有发言权，都可以充分发挥自己的智慧。这样，就使人们的认识在占有大量材料和丰富经验的基础上，经过分析提高，由个别到一般，由具体到抽象，由感性认识上升到理性认识，认识到事物的本质，事物发展变化的规律。因此，大家动手写文章和举行论文报告会的过程，就是人们对于客观事物规律性的认识深刻化的过程，也是从群众中来，到群众中去的过程。而随着群众的不断实践，不断地进行调查研究，分析思考和总结提高，我们的主观认识就可以不断地同客观实际相符合。这样也就能够使我们的生产、工作经常保持主动与高速度地跃进。
    群众写、群众讲、群众听、群众议论的过程，是群众自我教育的过程，也是党进行政治思想工作的一种行之有效的新方法。参加论文报告会的群众，在有虚有实、有评有比的辩论中，学到了理论，也就能够从理论观点上解决自己的思想认识问题，提高思想觉悟。上述丰台机务段的节约煤的论文报告会，许多机车小组在会后都检查了“唯条件论”的思想，树立了充分发挥主观能动性、人定胜天的思想。一些辅助部门的职工，从乘务员到检修工人，从化验员到技术员，从统计员到燃料给煤工，通过写文章，论文章，也认识到事物是互相联系和互相制约的道理，并进一步认识到自己与节约煤的关系，自己的工作同整体、同各部门的关系，积极地投入了夺煤大战。唐山站在实现装卸机械化的初期，使用效率只达10％，因而有的人产生了怀疑，企图走回头路。该站党总支针对这种思想问题，组织全站职工学习了《马克思主义者如何对待新生事物》的语录，并发动工人写文章，议论如何突破使用关。工人吴连写的论文说，要攻破使用关，必须首先攻破思想保守关，打破旧习惯和老常规，用不断革命的精神使装卸机械不断提高。该站党总支抓住这篇论文举行了论文报告会，并作为讲稿在工人中讲课，对工人的启发教育很大，不少工人表示要当不断革命家，当促进派，不当促退派，不走回头路。思想问题解决了，装卸机械的使用效率很快就提高到80％。实践证明，这种论文报告会的形式，发展了大鸣大放大字报大辩论的政治思想工作的方法，无论从内容和形式上，都使“四大”的工作方法提到一个较高的水平，添上了理论的色彩。
    总之，论文报告会是广大工人群众学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的一个好方法。我们体会到，把学习、生产和写文章结合起来，拧成一股绳，既可以很快地普遍提高工人的理论水平和思想觉悟，推动生产不断跃进，又可以提高工人的写作水平。目前已涌现出很多的写作积极分子。普遍推广这一学习方法，无疑将会迅速培养出一批工人阶级的既有丰富的实践经验，又有一定理论水平的能写能讲的“红秀才”来。
