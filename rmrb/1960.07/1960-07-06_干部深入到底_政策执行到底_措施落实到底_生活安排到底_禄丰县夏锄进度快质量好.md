Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 5th: Cadres at all levels in Lufeng County, Yunnan Province, implement "four thoroughs," going deeply into the front lines, constantly discovering problems and solving problems, which has powerfully promoted agricultural production throughout the county. The season here is relatively late. In previous years, rice transplanting would continue until the very end of the "Summer Solstice." However, this year, by the "Summer Solstice," weeding and soil loosening had already begun widely in all communes. As of June 26, 88% of the first hoeing of corn throughout the county had been completed, and 25% of the second hoeing; 66% of the first hoeing of rice had been completed, and 39% of the paddy fields had top-dressed with the first application of fertilizer.

Lufeng County's "four thoroughs" are: Cadres go deeply; policies are executed thoroughly; measures are implemented thoroughly; life is arranged thoroughly. These "four thoroughs" measures were proposed by the Lufeng County Party Committee this spring in order to improve the work style of cadres and strengthen specific leadership in agricultural production. At that time, the county party committee requested that cadres at all levels establish a deep and practical work style, grasping both production and livelihood with one hand, using policies to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and grasping increased production measures firmly, so that striving for a bumper harvest this year would be built on a reliable ideological and material foundation.

In order to implement the "four thoroughs," the county party committee first set an example by taking the lead in changing its work style. The five secretaries and members of the county party committee took responsibility for thirteen communes in different areas. The commune party committees also divided responsibilities to the administrative districts, and the administrative district party branches took responsibility to the production teams. In "going deeply," cadres at all levels, from the intense transplanting to the current mid-cultivation production, firmly implemented the "five wants" instructions put forward by the county party committee: First, they must run around. Within a month, the first secretary of the county party committee must run through every commune, and the county party committee members responsible for different areas must run through every commune in their area, as well as most of the administrative districts. The commune party committee must run through all administrative districts, as well as most production teams, so that cadres at all levels understand the overall situation. Second, they must listen, listening to reports from cadres everywhere, listening to the opinions of the masses, and understanding the thoughts and demands of the masses. Third, they must look, looking at the production situation, looking at the mood of the masses, and seeing the essence from the phenomena. Fourth, they must think, thinking about everything they see, summarizing experience, discovering problems, analyzing problems, and studying solutions to problems. Fifth, they must do, and leaders must insist on setting an example and holding on-site meetings to promote experience. After adopting this method, the work style of the vast number of cadres became more thorough, the information they grasped became more specific and comprehensive, and the measures they took became more meticulous and powerful. For example, when planting entered its final stage and mid-cultivation began, the county party committee found from in-depth investigations that some cadres had a "wait" mentality, wanting to wait until planting was completed before starting management; also, some teams had improper labor organization in weeding and soil loosening, and the arrangements were not specific, so work efficiency was not high; the thinning of corn seedlings was not thorough, and so on. Based on this situation, the first secretary and secretary of the county party committee went to Jinshan Administrative District of Jinshan Commune and Malong Production Team of Hekou Administrative District to hold discussions with the team leader, old farmers, party members, league members and activists to study, and through summarizing the lessons of reduced production caused by untimely weeding and soil loosening in previous years, they calculated the time spent, and specifically helped them arrange labor, setting off a high tide of mid-cultivation. The broad masses of cadres also learned from the county party committee, going deeply into the masses, summarizing experience, and grasping mid-cultivation weeding and soil loosening firmly.

Under the premise of putting politics in command and strengthening ideological leadership, they also persisted in implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, using policies to mobilize the masses and arouse their enthusiasm. In Lufeng County, 872 teams received overproduction rewards in the spring harvest distribution. After the spring harvest distribution, the First Administrative District of Jinshan Commune immediately checked seedlings and organized teams, concentrating 95% of the labor force to carry out a blitz of weeding and soil loosening, determined to strive for overproduction in the big spring. Ninety-eight production teams in Shezi Commune have all formulated measures to strive for overproduction, and the daily progress of weeding, soil loosening, and topdressing greatly exceeded the requirements of the county party committee.

The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more important it is to care about the lives of the masses. The whole county adhered to the practice of secretaries managing life and personally getting into the canteens, carefully arranging food and vegetables, and every cadre had to go to the kitchen every month to help change backward canteens. Each team planted enough vegetables according to the standard of ten to fifteen people per mu of vegetable land. In addition, they also used the edges of the fields to grow melons and beans on a large scale. The county's vegetable fields have fixed a total of 4,744 laborers for management, implementing varieties every season, and implementing intercropping and relay cropping, striving for high yields and more harvests.

The above measures prompted cadres and the masses to be of one mind and make a great effort to engage in mid-cultivation production. Now the mid-cultivation management measures of each commune have been implemented in the fields, and the work teams have implemented the responsibility system. In this way, it not only accelerated the progress of mid-cultivation, but also ensured the quality.

### 干部深入到底　政策执行到底　措施落实到底　生活安排到底  禄丰县夏锄进度快质量好

    干部深入到底　政策执行到底　措施落实到底　生活安排到底
    禄丰县夏锄进度快质量好
    新华社昆明5日电　云南禄丰县各级干部实行“四个到底”，深入第一线，不断发现问题解决问题，有力地推动了全县的农业生产。这里季节比较迟，往年栽秧要栽到“夏至”尾，但今年“夏至”时，各公社的中耕除草已经普遍展开，到6月26日止，全县玉米头道薅锄已完成88％，二道完成25％；水稻头道已薅66％，并有39％的稻田追施了头道肥。
    禄丰县的“四个到底”是：干部深入到底；政策执行到底；措施落实到底；生活安排到底。这“四个到底”的措施，是中共禄丰县委在今年春耕生产中，为了切实改进干部作风，对农业生产加强具体领导提出的。当时县委要求各级干部，要树立深入踏实的作风，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，用政策去调动群众的积极性，狠抓增产措施，使争取今年大丰收建立在可靠的思想基础和物质基础上。
  为了贯彻“四个到底”，县委首先以身作则，带头转变作风。全县十三个公社，由县委五个书记和委员分片包干；公社党委也分工包干到管理区，管理区党支部包干到生产队。在“深入到底”中，各级干部从紧张的栽插到当前的中耕生产，都坚定地执行了县委提出的“五个要”的指示：一是要跑，一个月内县委第一书记要跑遍每个公社，分片包干的县委委员除跑完所在片的每个公社外，还要跑大部分管理区，公社党委跑完所有的管理区外，还要跑完大部分生产队，促使各级干部了解全面情况。二是要听，到处听干部汇报，听群众意见，摸清群众的思想和要求。三是要看，看生产情况，看群众情绪，从现象看本质。四是要想，对看到的一切要想一想，总结经验，发现问题，分析问题，研究解决问题。五是要做，领导要坚持做样子，开现场会推广经验。采取这个办法后，广大干部作风更加深入，掌握的情况更加具体全面，采取的措施更加细致有力。例如当栽种进入尾声，中耕开始时，县委从深入中发现部分干部存在着“等”的思想，要等栽种完了再管理；还有的队薅锄中劳动组织不当，安排不具体，工效不高；包谷定苗不彻底，等等。根据这个情况，县委第一书记和书记分别深入金山公社金山管理区和河口管理区压密马龙生产队找队长、老农、党团员、积极分子座谈研究，通过总结往年不适时薅锄造成减产的教训，算了时间账，具体帮助他们安排劳动力，掀起了中耕高潮。广大干部也向县委学习，纷纷深入群众，总结经验，狠抓中耕薅锄。
    在政治挂帅加强思想领导的前提下，他们还坚持执行三包一奖的政策，用政策发动群众，调动群众的积极性。禄丰县在小春分配中，有八百七十二个队得到了超产奖励。金山公社第一管理区在小春分配后，立即查苗排队，并且集中95％的劳力突击薅锄，决心争取大春超产。舍资公社九十八个生产队都订出了争取超产的措施，薅锄、追肥日进度大大超过县委的要求。
    群众干劲越大，越要关心群众生活。全县坚持了书记管生活，亲自钻食堂的做法，把吃粮、吃菜细致安排好，每个干部每月都要下厨房，帮助改变落后食堂。各队都按十至十五人一亩菜地的标准种够了蔬菜。另外，还利用田边地角大种瓜豆。全县的菜地共固定了四千七百四十四个劳动力管理，季季落实品种，实行套种间种，力争高产多收。
    以上这些措施，促使干部群众一条心，一股劲大闹中耕生产。现在各公社中耕管理措施已经落实到田，作业组实行了责任制。这样，既加快了中耕进度，也保证了质量。
