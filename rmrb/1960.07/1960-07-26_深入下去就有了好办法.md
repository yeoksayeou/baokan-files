    Digging Deep Leads to Good Solutions
    Du Fa, Party Branch Secretary of Shiqi Brigade, Pingzhou Commune, Guangdong
    How can we rapidly change the face of backward areas? I had never found a good approach. Recently, after going deep among the commune members and practicing the "four togethers" (eat, live, work, and study together), I finally found an effective method.
    Let's take one example.
    Before this spring, our Shiqi Brigade was the worst pig-raising team in the entire commune. We were frequently criticized by the leaders, and the masses had many complaints. The cadres were floating on the surface, unable to find the reasons for our backwardness, feeling helpless, and very distressed. Recently, I decided to move my bedding to the pig farm to live there. I quickly uncovered the truth behind the pig farm's backwardness: it turned out that among the pig farm workers, seven were upper-middle peasants. They were irresponsible in their work, only concerned with "spontaneous tendencies" (i.e., capitalism), neglecting to feed the pigs adequately and ignoring the insufficient pigpens. So, I immediately mobilized the masses to rectify the pig-raising team, removed these upper-middle peasants, and replaced them with seven Party and Youth League members as pig farm workers. Following this, we mobilized the resident cadres to take the lead in feeding pigs and building pigpens, educating the workers to treat the farm as their home. By the end of June, the entire pig farm's appearance had completely changed, and we became a model pig-raising brigade in the entire county in one fell swoop.

    深入下去就有了好办法
    广东平州公社石?大队党总支书记　杜发
    怎样才能迅速改变落后地区的面貌？我一直没有摸到一条好门路。最近，深入下去与社员“四同”以后，才算找到了有效的办法。
    就拿一件事来说吧。
    我们石?大队在今春以前，是全社养猪最差的一个队。经常被领导点名批评，群众意见很多。干部浮在上面，找不出落后原因，束手无策，思想也很苦恼。最近，我下决心把铺盖搬到猪场去住，很快就弄清了猪场落后的真相：原来在饲养员中间，竟有七个是上中农，他们工作不负责任，只顾搞“自发”，猪吃不饱不管，猪舍不够又不理。于是我立即发动群众，整顿了养猪队伍，撤掉了这些上中农，换上七个党团员做饲养员。跟着，又发动驻场干部，人人带头喂猪、建猪舍，教育场员以场为家，到6月底，整个猪场面貌就彻底改变了，一举成为全县的养猪标兵大队。
