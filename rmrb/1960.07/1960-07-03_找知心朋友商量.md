After learning from the excellent work style of Luo Yangchun in following the mass line, Zhou Weixin, the Party Branch Secretary of the Tianmen Brigade of the Chongtian Commune in Changde County, Hunan, moved his luggage to the Third Work Team of the Third Production Team, which had been rated as the worst for five consecutive times. Upon arriving at the team, he immediately held a forum with the team's cadres and activists to understand their thoughts and the production situation. Furthermore, he made several close friends, including Li Shoushan, Li Zejiu, and Zhou Xianzu. This team had a relatively large amount of third-class seedlings, so he selected the patch that was growing the worst as his demonstration plot. He invited his close friends to the field to analyze the reasons why the seedlings were growing poorly. He himself went into the field and stomped hard with his feet, discovering that the base was very hard. He also tasted some of the mud, which was very alkaline and had no acidity. They concluded that the failure to tiller was due to the lack of acidic fertilizer. Then, they prescribed the right remedy, applying eighteen catties of ammonium sulfate and burying twenty-one loads of green manure in the rows, followed by another round of inter-tillage. Soon, the seedlings were completely transformed. Many commune members came to the field to observe and learn from his experience. A campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings was launched throughout the team. It was truly effective; the seedlings in every patch that received the correct treatment grew well. The commune members gave Zhou Weixin the title of "Good Doctor of Seedlings."

    找知心朋友商量
    湖南常德县冲天公社天门大队总支书记周维新学了罗阳春走群众路线的优良作风后，把行李搬到了五次被评为末名的第三生产队的第三作业组。一到组里，他就找组里的干部和积极分子开了个座谈会，摸思想和生产情况。并且，交上了李寿山、李泽九、周献祖等好几个知心朋友。这个组三类禾比较多，他就选了一块长得最差的作指挥田，把知心朋友找来，在田边分析禾长得不好的原因。他自己下田用脚使劲地踩下去，发现底子很硬，又尝了一些泥巴的味道，碱性很重，酸性没有，他们认为不发蔸是没有酸性肥料的缘故。接着便对症下药，追了十八斤硫酸铵，又在行子里踩了二十一担青肥，随着又中耕一次。不久，禾苗完全变了个样。好多社员都到田边来参观取经。全组掀起了消灭三类苗的热潮，真灵，丘丘对症下药，丘丘禾苗长好了。社员们送给周维新一个称号：“禾苗的好医师”。
