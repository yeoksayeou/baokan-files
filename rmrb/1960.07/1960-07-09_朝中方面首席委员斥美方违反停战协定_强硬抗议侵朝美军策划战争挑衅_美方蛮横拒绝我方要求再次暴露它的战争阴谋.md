Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: A message from Panmunjom: At the 121st meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held in Panmunjom today, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun, strongly protested against the U.S. side's planning of provocative "military exercises" in South Korea and the re-launching of "Honest John" rockets, and demanded an immediate end to such provocative conspiracies.

    Today's meeting was held at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun revealed that in order to launch a new war of aggression, the U.S. side had decided to mobilize the U.S. 7th Infantry Division stationed in South Korea to hold a so-called "atomic weapons demonstration exercise showing anti-communist strategy" near Dongducheon, close to the demilitarized zone, on July 9, and to launch "Honest John" rockets illegally transported into South Korea.

    Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that the conspiracy planned by the U.S. side is not only another blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also a threat to peace in Korea and the Far East, and a malicious provocation against the Korean people. The U.S. side's bluff is intended to save and maintain its precarious colonial rule in South Korea, to encourage its new running dog, the Xu Zheng group, to "march north," and also to use force to threaten and suppress the South Korean people who oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    Major General Zhu Changjun demanded that the U.S. side immediately take measures to stop such provocative conspiracies and withdraw U.S. troops and all atomic weapons and missiles illegally transported into South Korea.

    The U.S. chief member, Dawson, unreasonably refused the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

    Major General Zhu Changjun emphasized that the attitude taken by the U.S. side at today's meeting typically shows that the U.S. side does not intend to abide by the Armistice Agreement, attempts to permanently occupy South Korea, and continues to pursue a policy of war in South Korea in order to wait for an opportunity to launch another large-scale war of aggression.

    Major General Zhu Changjun once again warned the U.S. side: "If your side disregards our strong protests and warnings, refuses to withdraw from South Korea, and insists on taking such sinful actions, then your side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom."

    朝中方面首席委员斥美方违反停战协定
    强硬抗议侵朝美军策划战争挑衅
    美方蛮横拒绝我方要求再次暴露它的战争阴谋
  新华社平壤8日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在板门店举行的军事停战委员会第一百二十一次会议上，对美方策划在南朝鲜进行挑衅性的“军事演习”和再次发射“诚实的约翰”式火箭的行为提出强硬抗议，并要求立即停止这种挑衅性的阴谋活动。
    今天的会议是在朝中方面建议下举行的。朱昌骏少将在会上揭露：美方为了发动新的侵略战争，竟然决定动员强占南朝鲜的美国步兵第七师于7月9日在靠近非军事区的东豆川附近举行所谓“显示反共战略的原子武器示范演习”，并发射非法运入南朝鲜的“诚实的约翰”式火箭。
    朱昌骏少将指出：美方策划的这种阴谋活动不仅是又一次悍然违反朝鲜停战协定的行为，而且是对朝鲜和远东和平的威胁，对朝鲜人民的恶毒的挑衅。美方这样虚张声势，是为了挽救和维持它在南朝鲜的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治，给它新的走狗许政集团打气，唆使它们“北进”，并且也是为了用武力来威胁和镇压反对美帝国主义及其走狗的南朝鲜人民。
    朱昌骏少将要求美方立即采取措施，停止这种挑衅性的阴谋活动，并且把美军和非法运入南朝鲜的一切原子武器和导弹撤出南朝鲜。
    美方首席委员陶逊蛮横无理地拒绝了朝中方面的要求。
    朱昌骏少将强调指出：美方在今天的会议上所采取的态度，典型地表明美方不打算遵守停战协定，企图永久霸占南朝鲜，并且继续在南朝鲜推行战争政策，以便待机再次发动大规模的侵略战争。
    朱昌骏少将再次警告美方：“如果你方不顾我方的强硬抗议和警告，不撤出南朝鲜，硬要一意孤行地采取那种罪恶行为，那么你方必须对由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任”。
