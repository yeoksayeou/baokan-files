Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved the goal of every commune having its own power station and every production team having its own hydropower station. Currently, the entire county is connecting existing and newly built hydropower stations according to the canal system, forming a complete system.

At present, 150 factories, 25 water-lifting irrigation projects, and over 1,000 sets of agricultural and sideline product processing machinery are powered by electricity, saving the equivalent of more than 70,000 laborers and over 100,000 draft animals. The seven hydropower stations on the West Branch Canal of the Heihe Canal and the six hydropower stations on the East Main Canal of the Meihui Canal have been connected into a system, with a total power generation capacity of 493.3 kilowatts. Twenty "water dragon" power stations on ten rivers and two "fire dragon" power stations alongside the Xi'an-Baoji Highway are also being connected into systems or are planned to be connected. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial on-site conference on hydropower stations in Zhouzhi County to summarize and promote the county's experience in running power stations.

Zhouzhi County is located south of the Qinling Mountains and north of the Wei River. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the masses built 550 canals and 49 reservoirs. The county has a network of canals, and the water energy reserves amount to over 40,000 kilowatts. In 1957, 610 hydropower stations were built, with a total capacity of 2,745 horsepower, and many production teams achieved water-powered milling and cotton ginning. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the county has launched a mass campaign to run power stations. To date, 19 hydropower stations have been built, with a power generation capacity of over 400 kilowatts; four thermal power stations have been built, with a power generation capacity of over 38 kilowatts; and 44.5 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines have been erected. Thirty-four hydropower stations are under construction, with an estimated power generation capacity of 1,241 kilowatts, and 66 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines are being erected.

The Zhouzhi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, considering that most of the county's power stations were scattered and the benefits of electricity could not be fully realized, decided to connect all the originally built power stations to form a complete system, achieving a networked power grid and interconnected stations. This would allow for unified use of electricity and unified arrangement of production. For example, the Heihe Canal West Branch Canal No. 1 Hydropower Station, with a power generation capacity of 80 kilowatts, could only supply eleven processing plants and a reservoir construction site before it was connected into a system. After it was connected with the No. 2 Hydropower Station, in addition to supplying the aforementioned areas, it could also power two pumping stations and ten electric waterwheels.

### 盩厔县社社有电站

    盩厔县社社有电站
    据新华社西安电　陕西盩厔县实现了社社有电站、队队有水力站。现在全县正在按照渠道系统，把现有的水电站和新修的水电站连接起来，使它成龙配套。
    目前，全县一百五十个工厂、二十五处提水灌溉工程和一千多件农副产品加工机具，都是用电力来带动，等于节约了七万多个劳力和十万多头畜力。这个县的黑惠渠西一支渠七个水电站，和梅惠渠东干渠六个水电站已配套成龙，发电能力共达四百九十三点三瓩。正在成龙配套和计划成龙配套的，还有十条河道上的二十条“水龙”电站以及西（安）宝（鸡）公路旁的两条“火龙”电站。最近中共陕西省委和省人民委员会，在盩厔县召开了全省水力站、水电站现场会议，总结和推广了这个县办电的经验。
    盩厔县南依秦岭，北滨渭河。解放后，群众在党的领导下，修建了五百五十条渠道，四十九座水库。全县渠道如网，水能蕴藏量达四万瓩以上。一九五七年又修建了六百一十座水力站，功能共二千七百四十五马力，很多队的磨面、轧花实现了水力化。一九五八年大跃进以来，全县又掀起了群众办电的热潮。迄今已建成水电站十九座，发电能力四百多瓩；火电站四座，发电能力三十八多瓩；架设高压输电线路四十四点五公里。正在施工的水电站三十四座，预计可发电一千二百四十一瓩，正在架设的高压输电线路六十六公里。
    中共盩厔县委考虑到全县电站大部分是分散的，电力效益不能充分发挥，因此就决定把原来兴修的电站全部连接起来，配套成龙，做到线路成网、站站相连。这样，就可以统一使用电力和统一安排生产。如发电能力为八十瓩的黑惠渠西一支渠一号水电站，没有配成龙以前，只能供应十一个加工厂和一个水库工地使用，它和二号水电站配套成龙以后，除供应上述地区外，还可以带动两个抽水站和十个电动水车。
