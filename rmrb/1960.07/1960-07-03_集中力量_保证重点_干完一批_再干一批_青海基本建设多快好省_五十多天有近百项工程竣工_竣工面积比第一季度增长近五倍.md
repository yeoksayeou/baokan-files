    Concentrate Strength, Guarantee Key Projects, Finish One Batch, Then Another Batch
    Qinghai's Basic Construction is More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
    Nearly 100 Projects Completed in Over 50 Days; Completed Area Increased Nearly Five Times Compared to the First Quarter
    (Our Newspaper Xining 2nd dispatch) In order to ensure the early completion of the annual basic construction tasks, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China implemented the principle of "concentrating strength, guaranteeing key projects, conducting batch blitzes, and fighting battles of annihilation," which greatly accelerated the progress of basic construction throughout the province. Since late April, the province has successively organized four campaigns. As a result, all four battles were victorious. By June 15, nearly 100 major projects had been completed or basically completed, with an average of one to two projects completed every day. The area of completed projects increased nearly five times compared to the first quarter of this year.
    Qinghai Province's basic construction tasks this year are much larger than the actual completed workload last year. In order to ensure that these projects are completed with high quality, quantity, and on schedule, the Provincial Party Committee specifically established a Basic Construction Office, headed by the First Secretary, Comrade Gao Feng, as the director of the office, to specifically lead this work. In terms of construction steps, adhering to the principle of ensuring key projects and taking care of general projects, the basic construction supporting agriculture and the steel industry was elevated to the primary position, with other projects ranked accordingly. In terms of construction deployment, the method of "concentrating strength, guaranteeing key projects, conducting batch blitzes, and fighting battles of annihilation" was adopted, and campaigns were organized to "finish one batch, then another batch." At the beginning of each campaign, a provincial-wide basic construction broadcast mobilization meeting was held to summarize the work of the previous stage and deploy the tasks of the next campaign, so that employees in each campaign had "purpose in battle and direction in attack." The workers said: Concentrating strength is a treasure, batch blitzes are highly efficient, guaranteeing key projects leads to overall development, and the path to more, faster, better, and more economical construction is clear.
    Leaders going deep into the front lines of projects and working alongside the workers is another important aspect of Qinghai Province's achievement of high-speed development in basic construction. Liang Changhan, director of the Qinghai Provincial Basic Construction Committee, personally went to the front lines in each campaign, delving into key construction sites such as agricultural and livestock machinery factories and steel plants, adopting the method of "three arrangements" (arranging project schedules, arranging manpower, arranging materials), "two inspections" (inspecting problems, inspecting key points), and "one grasp" (grasping measures), discovering problems and solving them in a timely manner. A key project in Xining City was progressing slowly due to untimely material supply and unreasonable labor allocation. After Comrade Liang Changhan and leading cadres of the construction company discovered this problem, they immediately rationally arranged materials, manpower, and transportation tools, completing the task that was originally planned to take more than eight months in just over twenty days. In addition, the organization of "ten deliveries to the site," including meals, laundry, haircuts, and machinery repair, further boosted the morale of the workers.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the projects, the workers in Qinghai Province's construction departments broke the idea of "waiting for rice to cook" and relied on their own efforts to "make rice to cook," launching a mass movement to produce building materials. These units include professional departments, construction departments, as well as construction units in petroleum, railway, metallurgy, health, and urban and rural people's communes, all of which have established various types of building materials production plants (sites). In the past two months or so, units in the Xining area have established more than 30 cement plants, as well as a large number of brick and tile factories and lumber mills. In the past, the Xining City Construction Company relied on external units for the materials needed most in construction, such as sand, gravel, white ash, bricks, and tiles. This year, they did not ask the state for a single penny, but established affiliated factories for bricks, tiles, cement, precast components, etc. Now, the white ash, bricks, tiles, cement, etc. produced by these factories have reached partial or complete self-sufficiency. While producing building materials, various units also vigorously grasped the conservation and comprehensive utilization of "three materials," vigorously promoting methods such as using bamboo instead of wood, using sand and gravel instead of bricks, using broken wood instead of finished timber, and assembling broken materials into large materials, saving materials and ensuring the needs of key projects. Due to the above-mentioned measures to increase production and save materials, sufficient "food" was provided for "fighting battles of annihilation," accelerating the early completion of key projects.
    Currently, the workers on the basic construction front in Qinghai Province are taking advantage of the current good construction time to ensure a substantial increase in production.

### 集中力量　保证重点　干完一批　再干一批  青海基本建设多快好省  五十多天有近百项工程竣工　竣工面积比第一季度增长近五倍

    集中力量　保证重点　干完一批　再干一批
    青海基本建设多快好省
    五十多天有近百项工程竣工　竣工面积比第一季度增长近五倍
    本报西宁2日电　中共青海省委为了保证全年基本建设任务提前完成，贯彻了“集中力量，保证重点，分批突击，打歼灭战”的方针，使全省基本建设进度大大加快。自4月下旬以来，全省连续组织了四次战役。结果四战四捷，到6月15日止，竣工和基本竣工的主要工程有近百项，平均每天有一至二项工程建成。竣工工程的面积比今年第一季度增长了近五倍。
    青海省今年基本建设任务比去年实际完成的工程量要大得多。为了使这些工程按质、按量、按期完成，省委特地成立了基本建设办公室，由第一书记高峰同志挂帅，担任办公室主任，具体领导这一工作。在建设的步骤上，本着确保重点、照顾一般的原则，把支援农业和钢铁等工业的基本建设提高到首要地位，其他项目挨次排队。在施工部署上采取“集中力量，保证重点，分批突击，打歼灭战”的办法，组织战役作到“干完一批、再干一批”。每个战役开始，都召开了全省的基本建设广播誓师大会，总结上一阶段工作，部署下一战役任务，使职工在每个战役中都“战有目的，攻有方向”。职工们说：集中力量是件宝，分批突击效率高，保证重点带全面，多快好省路一条。
    领导深入工程第一线，跟班劳动，是青海省基本建设获得高速度发展的另一个重要方面。青海省基本建设委员会主任梁昌汉在每次战役中都亲临前线，深入到农牧机械厂、钢铁厂等重点建设工地，采取了“三排”（安排工程工期、安排人力、安排材料）、“两查”（查问题、查关键）、“一抓”（抓措施）的办法，发现问题，及时解决。西宁市的一个重点工程，由于材料供应不及时，劳动力安排得不够合理，进度迟缓。梁昌汉同志和建筑公司领导干部发现了这个问题以后，立即合理安排了材料、人力和运输工具，使原计划要八个多月才能完成的任务，只用了二十多天就基本竣工了。此外，还组织了吃饭、洗衣、理发、机械修理等“十送现场”的办法，更鼓舞了职工们的斗志。
    为确保工程的顺利进展，青海省建筑部门的职工打破了“等米下锅”的思想，自力更生，“造米下锅”，开展群众性的大造建筑材料运动。这些单位有专业部门，建筑部门，同时石油、铁路、冶金、卫生等建设单位及城乡人民公社也都办起了各类建筑材料生产厂（场）。西宁地区各单位在最近两个多月中，就办起了三十多个水泥厂，还有大批砖瓦厂和木材厂。过去西宁市建筑公司在施工中需要量最多的沙石、白灰、砖瓦等材料，一向是靠外单位供应，今年他们没有要国家一文钱，办起了砖瓦、水泥、白灰、预制构件等附属工厂，现在，这些工厂生产的白灰、砖瓦、水泥等已达到部分自给或全部自给。在生产建筑材料的同时，各单位还狠抓“三材”的节约和综合利用，大力推行以竹代木、以砂石代砖、以碎木材代成材、拼凑碎料成大材等办法，节约用料，保证了重点工程的需要。由于采取了上述增产节约材料的措施，从而为“打歼灭战”提供了充足的“粮食”，加速了重点工程的提前完成。
    目前，青海省基本建设战线职工，正在乘当前施工的大好时光，确保大幅度增产。
