    Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking workers, closely focusing on the key to production, are vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution. In the first half of July, the average smelting time per furnace of steel was seven minutes shorter than the same period in June.

    On July 9th, the workers of Class A of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace, targeting the long charging time of the open-hearth furnace as the key to extending steelmaking time, used the experience of rapid charging technical innovation. It only took 55 minutes to charge a furnace, which was 20 minutes shorter than before. As a result, a furnace of fast-smelted steel was produced in seven hours and fifty-five minutes. The other three shifts learned from the technical innovation experience of Class A and adopted new operating methods such as frequent slag making and frequent slag removal, which shortened the smelting time again and again. As a result, the No. 9 open-hearth furnace created a new record of producing four furnaces of steel a day, with the quality fully meeting the specifications. The Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee promptly summarized and promoted the experience of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace; steelmaking workers launched a competition craze of "learning from No. 9, catching up with No. 9, and surpassing No. 9." Workers of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace held a Zhuge Liang meeting and adopted new operating methods such as quickly handling slag, and also created a new record of producing four furnaces of steel on July 10th.

    In the battle to overcome key problems, leading cadres at all levels worked alongside the workers by the open-hearth furnace to find and overcome key problems, which made many key problems solved quickly and well. Jin Duo, the Party Committee Secretary of the Second Steelmaking Plant, found that the workers of the No. 10 open-hearth furnace only paid attention to fast smelting and ignored the maintenance of the furnace body, so he promptly helped the workers of this open-hearth furnace, summarized the experience of "three diligences" in protecting the furnace: diligent inspection, diligent patching, and diligent blowing. He also helped the workers boldly create a new method of repairing the furnace while tapping steel, which improved the operating rate of the open-hearth furnace and increased the production of high-quality steel by 369 tons for the country in the first five days of July alone.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 22nd.  Wuhan Iron and Steel's Daye Iron Mine vigorously attacked the "equipment maintenance barrier." In early July, the equipment utilization rate of the entire mine increased from 60% to about 90%. Ore production increased by 14.2% compared with the same period last month.

    In the battle to attack the equipment maintenance barrier, a command headquarters was established at all levels from the mine to the workshop. They adopted a combination of professional repair teams and self-inspection and self-repair by production workers to ensure the high speed and quality of this equipment maintenance work. In this battle to overcome key problems, the professional repair team improved the labor organization and formed three teams: one team was sent to the production section to conduct detailed investigations and research on key equipment to ensure planned maintenance; one team was in charge of the pre-assembly of the main parts of the equipment; and another team was responsible for temporary rush repairs. At the same time, the mine also formulated the items and scope of maintenance and repair for production workers, and mobilized workers to self-inspect and self-repair. And organized cadres, workers, and technicians to combine maintenance. The masses of the entire mine worked together, greatly accelerating the progress of maintenance and improving the quality of maintenance. For example, the unloading plate of the ball mill hopper was worn through. In the past, it could not be solved for a long time due to the lack of spare parts. Now the workers also used waste materials to repair, weld, and repair it themselves, quickly solving the difficulty of the lack of spare parts and enabling the equipment to produce normally.

    鞍钢缩短平炉冶炼时间  大冶提高矿山设备利用率
    本报讯　鞍钢炼钢职工紧紧围绕生产关键，大闹技术革新和技术革命，7月上半月平均每炉钢熔炼时间比6月同时期缩短了七分钟。
    7月9日，九号平炉甲班的职工针对平炉装料时间长延长炼钢时间的关键，运用快速加料技术革新的经验，装一炉料只用了五十五分钟，比过去缩短了二十分钟，结果用七时五十五分钟炼出一炉快速炼钢。其他三个班学习了甲班技术革新经验，又采取了勤造渣、勤放渣等新操作法，使熔炼时间一再缩短。结果使九号平炉创造了一天出钢四炉的新纪录，质量完全合乎规格。鞍钢党委及时总结推广了九号平炉经验；炼钢工人们掀起了“学九号、赶九号、超九号”竞赛热潮，一号平炉工人开了诸葛亮会，采取了快速处理好渣和新操作方法，在7月10日也创造了出四炉钢的新纪录。
    在攻关战斗中，各级领导干部在平炉旁同工人一起找关键、攻关键，使许多关键解决的又快又好。第二炼钢厂党委书记金铎发现十号平炉只顾快熔炼而忽视维护炉体，就及时帮助这座平炉的工人，总结了勤检查、勤贴补、勤吹扫的三勤护炉经验，并且帮助工人大胆创造出一边出钢，一边补炉的新方法，提高了平炉作业率，仅7月前五天就为国家增产三百六十九吨优质钢。
    本报讯　武钢大冶铁矿猛攻“设备维修关”，7月上旬全矿的设备利用率由60％提高到90％左右。矿石产量比上月同期提高14.2％。
    这个铁矿在猛攻设备维修关的战役中，从矿到车间层层成立了攻关指挥部。他们采取专业检修队伍检修同生产工人自检、自修结合进行，保证了这次设备检修工作的高速优质。在这次攻关战役中，专业检修队伍改进了劳动组织，组成三套班子：一套班子下放到生产工段，对重点设备进行细致的调查研究工作，作到有计划的检修；一套班子专管设备主件预装工作；另一套班子担任临时性的突击检修。同时，该矿又订出了生产工人维护检修的项目和范围，发动工人自检自修。并组织干部、工人、技术人员三结合检修。全矿群众一齐动手，大大加快了检修的进度和提高了检修的质量。如球磨机漏斗卸板磨穿了，过去因缺少备件长期不能解决，现在工人也自己动手利用废料修整、焊补，迅速解决了备件缺乏的困难，使设备正常生产。
