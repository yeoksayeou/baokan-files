This dispatch from Hefei, July 15th reports that Tianchang County, Anhui Province, is carrying out a mass movement to check production and supplement measures, summarizing the agricultural production achievements of the first half of the year, tapping the production potential of the second half of the year, and striving to better complete the annual agricultural production plan. Since mid-June, more than 190,000 cadres and commune members throughout the county have participated in this activity. They carefully checked the implementation of the agricultural production plans for the first half of the year at the commune, production brigade, and production team levels, and checked the current production and the completion of labor quotas by commune members field by field and farm (factory) by farm (factory). The inspection shows that the agricultural production situation in the first half of the year is very good: the yield of more than 690,000 mu of summer grain crops exceeded that of last year, the area of ​​spring-sown crops was more than half larger than that of last year, and they generally grew well. Early rice generally grew thick stalks, long ears, many grains, and plump grains, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. The number of pigs raised has also doubled compared with the beginning of the year. However, the inspection revealed that although the agricultural production in the first half of the year has achieved great results, the production potential is still very large. For example, there are still more than 180,000 mu of barren mountains and slopes in the county that can be reclaimed for planting, and there are many scattered plots of land that can be used. Intercropping can be carried out in the fields of tall-stalked crops sown in the spring, and interplanting can be carried out in newly cultivated forest land. Because this year's spring sowing area has been expanded, there are more stubbles for planting late autumn crops. On the other hand, the inspection revealed that although some production projects have developed on the original basis, they have not yet completed the planned tasks. For example, although the yield of summer crops exceeded that of last year, some wheat fields suffered from hail and floods, resulting in some losses. The planting plan for 50,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes has been poorly completed. If measures are not taken to remedy these problems, the comprehensive completion of this year's agricultural production plan will be affected.
    On the basis of reviewing achievements, Tianchang County, in accordance with the principle of taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements, in addition to making appropriate arrangements for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the second half of the year, has taken various measures to concentrate its efforts to ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's agricultural production plan. According to the current production situation, first of all, tightly grasp the link of planting more and harvesting more, and vigorously expand the planting area, paying attention to planting more high-yield crops in the expansion of planting. The county has widely organized cadres and the masses to conduct field-by-field, slope-by-slope, and beach-by-beach inspections, and launched a movement to expand planting by reclaiming wherever there is wasteland, planting wherever there is space, and interplanting wherever there is a gap. The county has also concentrated 90% of the rural labor force into the summer planting campaign through comprehensive adjustments, and has mobilized more than 20,000 urban laborers to participate in summer planting. At present, summer planting has achieved great results, with more than 64,000 mu of wasteland being reclaimed and planted while being opened up, and more than 26,000 mu of crops being planted in vacant land in front of and behind houses, along roads and ditches. Soybeans and mung beans are also interplanted in forest land and tall-stalked crop land, so that the county has overfulfilled its original summer planting plan. In order to expand the planting area of ​​late autumn crops, all localities have generally carried out crop arrangements and prepared seeds through methods such as transfer and inventory clearance.
    In order to ensure that more crops are planted well, all communes are working hard to solve the problems of water and fertilizer for summer crops. Due to the large number of water conservancy projects built and the abundant rainfall this year, the current water storage capacity of water conservancy projects in the county has increased by nearly one time compared with the same period last year. However, because some of the water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring have not completed the auxiliary projects, some reservoirs have water but cannot irrigate the fields. These areas have built many canals and culverts in conjunction with water storage and flood control. In the upland areas lacking water sources, the ponds and dams have been heightened and thickened in conjunction with water storage, increasing the water storage capacity by more than 11 million cubic meters. Most of the damaged water pumps in the county have been repaired. Through the above methods, the problem of drought and waterlogging in 220,000 mu of farmland in the county has been basically solved. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, all localities seized the favorable opportunity of summer weed growth to cut green grass and rot green manure. More than 240,000 field head cellars in the county have fermented a large amount of fertilizer. The fertilizer that has been accumulated in the county has prepared 186 dan of topdressing and base fertilizer per mu of autumn field.
    At present, summer planting has basically ended, and all localities have regarded strengthening field management as an important measure to complete this year's agricultural production plan. More than 50% of the labor force in the county has been concentrated to form three professional teams for rice, dry grain, and cotton, and the "three guarantees and one reward" system has been implemented. Now, nearly 200,000 mu of middle rice in the county has been topdressed and weeded; each mu has been topdressed with 40 to 50 dan of green manure and human and animal manure.

　　总结经验　大挖潜力
　　天长县查生产补措施力争丰收
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省天长县开展全民性的查生产、补措施运动，总结上半年的农业生产成就，挖掘下半年的生产潜力，力争更好地完成全年农业生产计划。从6月中旬开始，全县有十九万多名干部和社员参加这一活动。他们细致地检查了公社、生产大队、生产队三级对上半年农业生产计划的执行情况，并且逐田逐场（厂）地检查了当前生产和社员完成劳动定额的情况。检查的情况表明，上半年的农业生产形势很好：六十九万多亩夏收粮食作物的产量超过去年，春播作物面积比去年扩大一半以上，而且普遍生长良好，早稻一般都长得茎秆粗壮，穗长，粒多，粒饱，呈现了一片丰收景象。生猪饲养量也比年初增加了一倍。但是，在检查中发现，上半年的农业生产虽然取得巨大的成绩，生产中的潜力仍然很大。如全县还有十八万多亩荒山、荒坡，可以开垦种植，能利用的零星地也不少。在春播的高秆作物田里可实行套种，在新培育的林地里可以间种。因为今年春播面积扩大，有更多的茬口可多种晚秋作物。另一方面，通过检查，发现有些生产项目虽然在原有基础上有了发展，但还没有完成预定的计划。如夏收作物的产量虽然超过了去年，但因为一部分麦田遭到雹、涝灾害，受到了一些损失。五万亩春山芋的栽种计划，完成得很差。这些问题如不采取措施补救，就将影响今年农业生产计划的全面完成。
    天长县在检阅成绩的基础上，根据以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，除了对下半年的林、牧、副、渔四业作了适当安排外，采取了各种措施，集中力量保证完成和超额完成今年的农业生产计划。根据当前生产情况，首先紧紧地抓住多种多收一环，大力扩大种植面积，在扩种中注意多种高产作物。全县广泛地组织干部和群众，逐田、逐坡、逐滩检查，开展了见荒就开，见空就种，见缝就插的扩种运动。全县还通过全面调整，集中了90％的农村劳力投入夏种运动，另外又发动两万多名城镇劳力，参加夏种。目前，夏种已取得很大成绩，已边开边种了六万四千多亩荒地，利用屋前屋后、路旁沟边等空隙地种了二万六千多亩作物，林地和高秆作物地里也都间种了黄豆和绿豆，使全县超额完成了原来的夏种计划。为了扩大晚秋作物的种植面积，各地又普遍进行了作物安排，并采取调剂、清仓等办法准备了种子。
    为了保证既多种又种好，各公社都努力解决夏种作物的用水、用肥问题。由于修的水利工程多，今年的雨水充沛，目前全县水利工程的蓄水量，比去年同期增加近一倍。但是，因为去冬今春兴建的水利工程，有些没有完成附属工程，有的水库有水灌不到田里去。这些地区已结合蓄水和防汛，兴建了许多渠道、涵洞。在缺乏水源的岗地，结合蓄水对塘坝进行了加高培厚，增加了一千一百多万立方米的蓄水量。全县损坏的抽水机绝大部分已经修好。通过上述办法，全县二十二万亩农田易旱易涝的问题，基本得到了解决。在积肥运动中，各地抓住了夏季杂草丛生的有利时机，大砍青草，大沤绿肥。全县二十四万多个田头窖，都沤制了大量的肥料。全县已积攒的肥料，已为每亩秋田准备了一百八十六担追肥和基肥。
    目前，夏种已经基本结束，各地又把加强田间管理，作为完成今年农业生产计划的重要措施。全县已集中了50％以上的劳力，成立了水稻、旱粮、棉花三种专业队，推行了“三包一奖”制。现在，全县的中稻，已有近二十万亩追了肥，耘了草；每亩已追施绿肥和人畜粪四十到五十多担。
