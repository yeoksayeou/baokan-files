Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: Seoul dispatch: Youth and students in Gyeonggi Province, South Chungcheong Province, and other areas of South Korea have been staging demonstrations to oppose the "Fifth National Assembly Election" farce being staged by the Huh Jung group and South Korean traitorous politicians under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism. This "election" is scheduled to be held on July 29th.

According to a report by the South Korean Haptong News Agency, at 5 p.m. on the 4th, more than 250 students from Anseong Middle School in Anseong Township, Gyeonggi Province, held a demonstration against Lee Seung-man's Liberal Party member, Oh Jae-young, who was "running" for "National Assembly member" there. The students shouted slogans demanding the cancellation of Oh Jae-young's "candidate" registration and held a sit-down demonstration in front of Oh Jae-young's "election office."

It is also reported that more than 1,000 students in Cheonan Township, South Chungcheong Province, held a demonstration on July 2nd against Han Hee-seok, the Lee Seung-man Liberal Party's "Planning Committee" member and one of the direct planners of the fake "presidential election" on March 15th this year, who was "running" for "National Assembly member" there. The students held up placards and shouted slogans condemning the crimes of the traitorous politicians and demanded the immediate cancellation of their "candidate" registrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: Our correspondent reports: U.S. imperialism is manipulating the Huh Jung group and a group of traitorous politicians in South Korea to stage a "Fifth National Assembly Election" farce, attempting to paralyze the South Korean people's will to fight through deceptive means and enable its loyal lackeys to continue to control the South Korean regime through a false "election" formality. All the facts prove that this "election" is nothing more than a repetition of the dirty "election" farces repeatedly manufactured by Lee Seung-man in the past. The Huh Jung group, in its formulated "election law," stipulates huge "guarantee deposits" and restrictions on property, residence, and age, depriving the vast majority of workers and peasants of their right to vote and stand for election. At the same time, the Huh Jung group has also organized "police mobile units" to use bloody suppression and violent coercion to control and manipulate this "election."

The "candidate" registration for this pseudo "election" in South Korea ended on July 2nd. Among the registered "Councilors" and "National Assemblymen" "candidates" are 65 members of Lee Seung-man's "Liberal Party," including Lee Seung-man's confidant, the Vice-Chairman of the Liberal Party, and the criminal Han Hee-seok, who directly planned the false "presidential election" on March 15th this year. The "Democratic Party," another group of lackeys long fostered by U.S. imperialism in South Korea, has the largest number of "candidates," with 372. 60% of the "candidates" claim to be "non-partisan," but according to South Korean news agencies, eight or nine out of ten of them are traitorous politicians who have recently defected from the "Liberal Party" and the "Democratic Party" in the changes in the South Korean political situation and are engaging in political speculation under the banner of "non-partisan."

    反对卖国政客上演“选举”丑剧
    南朝鲜青年学生愤怒示威
    新华社平壤5日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜京畿道、忠清南道等地的青年学生纷纷举行示威，反对许政集团和南朝鲜卖国政客在美帝国主义的操纵下演出所谓“第五届国会选举”丑剧。这次“选举”预定在7月29日举行。
    据南朝鲜和同通讯社报道，4日下午五时，京畿道安城邑安法中学的二百五十多名学生举行示威，反对李承晚的自由党分子吴在泳在那里“竞选”“国会议员”。学生们高呼口号，要求取消吴在泳的“候选人”登记，并且在吴在泳的“选举办公室”前举行静坐示威。
    另悉，忠清南道天安邑的一千多名学生7月2日举行示威，反对李承晚的自由党的“计划委员”、今年3月15日伪“总统选举”的直接策划者之一韩熙锡在那里“竞选”“国会议员”。学生们举着标语牌，高呼口号，谴责卖国政客的罪行，要求立即取消他们的“候选人”登记。
    据新华社平壤5日电　本社记者报道：美帝国主义正操纵许政集团和一批卖国政客在南朝鲜演出“第五届国会选举”的丑剧，企图用欺骗手法麻痹南朝鲜人民的斗争意志，并使它的忠实走狗通过虚伪的“选举”形式继续掌握南朝鲜的政权。一切事实证明，这次“选举”不过是李承晚过去多次制造的肮脏的“选举”丑剧的重演。许政集团在它制定的“选举法”中规定巨额的“保证金”、以及财产、居住、年龄等限制，剥夺了广大工农群众的选举权和被选举权。同时，许政集团还组织“警察机动队”，要用血腥镇压和暴力胁迫手段来控制和操纵这次“选举”。
    南朝鲜这次伪“选举”的“候选人”登记在7月2日已经结束。登记的“参议员”和“民议员”的“候选人”中有李承晚的“自由党”党徒六十五名，其中有李承晚的亲信、自由党的副议长、直接策划今年3月15日伪“总统选举”的罪犯韩熙锡等。美帝国主义在南朝鲜长期豢养的另一批奴才“民主党”的“候选人”最多，有三百七十二名。“候选人”中有60％号称是“无党派”人士，但是据南朝鲜通讯社报道，他们当中十分之八、九都是最近在南朝鲜政局变动中从“自由党”和“民主党”脱党出来打着“无党派”的招牌进行政治投机的卖国政客。
