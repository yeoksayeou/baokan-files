    Splashes of Struggle
    — Small Stories from the Japanese People's Anti-American, Anti-Kishi Movement
    The Communist Party's Contingent Arrives
    Kato Shiro, a university researcher in Chiba Prefecture, wrote to the "Akahata" newspaper: I was in front of Kishi Nobusuke's official residence when I saw the Communist Party's parade contingent, and I couldn't contain my excitement.

    The orderly ranks, the red flags fluttering in the wind, and the inspiring slogans. Whether they were white-haired old people or young men and women, they marched in unison, their fighting spirit soaring. The power of unified will displayed by the entire contingent made me feel that it could withstand any pressure. At that time, I constantly heard voices around me saying: "Ah, the Communist Party!" "The Communist Party's contingent has arrived!" I think the Communist Party's parade contingent set an example for us.
    The Farmer's Bugle
    Members of the Japanese Communist Party in Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, visited an old farmer while collecting signatures against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." After signing, he said: "In the past, farmers' struggles invariably used straw mats as flags and conch shells as bugles. We firmly oppose Kishi Nobusuke's actions." He even specially found the conch shell he used in the past from his home and gave it to the Communist Party members who were collecting signatures. He said: "Take it and use it!"

    From the 18th unified action onwards, the traditional bugle sound of the peasant uprising "wooed" throughout the skies of the Tokorozawa area.
    The Soundless Voice
    Kishi Nobusuke once slandered the demonstrations and parades of millions of Japanese people as the doings of a small group of people, and falsely claimed that although the majority of the people remained silent, they supported the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Therefore, he said he wanted "to listen to the opinions without sound."

    On June 18, when about 400,000 people in Tokyo surrounded the Japanese Diet and held a powerful demonstration against the Japan-U.S. military treaty, several young people raised a large banner with the words: "We are the voiceless citizens." In an instant, a huge contingent of more than 3,000 people gathered under this banner.
    Mother is Angry
    When the storm of the anti-American, anti-Kishi struggle swept across Japan, a middle school student wanted to participate in a demonstration. However, he was worried about being reprimanded by his mother, who was always afraid of causing trouble. Nevertheless, he later couldn't restrain his inner anger and went to participate in the demonstration without telling his mother.

    After his mother found out, she scolded her son very angrily. However, her first words were:

    "What kind of person do you think I am? Would I not let you participate in such a good thing as opposing the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'?"
    Marriage and Treaty
    An elderly couple in Fukui City had been worried about their daughter's marriage for a long time. Recently, they found a suitable candidate. The two elders decided to arrange a place for them to meet and get to know each other. The following is a conversation between the young man and woman while drinking tea and chatting.

    Woman: "Recently, the newspapers are full of 'Security Treaty,' 'Security Treaty.' What do you think about this issue?"
    Man: "Oh, no, I am completely unconcerned about these things..."
    Woman: "The newspapers publish so much about it every day, how can we not pay attention to it? Don't you think that if we all ignore it, it will cause war?"
    Man: "I have always avoided getting involved in such issues."
    Unable to agree, the daughter rejected the marriage proposal.
    A Policeman's Words
    One day, several comrades from the Miyagi Prefecture Taga City branch of the Japanese Communist Party were conducting door-to-door visits in the Taga City shopping street, collecting signatures against the "Security Treaty." Suddenly, they noticed a policeman following them. A party member walked up to the policeman without hesitation and said to him: "We are the Communist Party members from Taga City. We are asking you to sign in opposition to the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'" Then, he explained the dangers of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to the policeman. The policeman said: "You are doing a good thing, you should do it well!" However, he was unwilling to sign, and explained: "I am neutral."

    "Is there any neutrality between war and peace?" he was asked directly by the signature collector. After hearing this, the policeman said: "Because of my position, please forgive me for not signing. But, I understand the principle. I hope you will work harder!" After saying that, he took off his hat, bowed to the people, and turned away. (Zheng Yingda)

### 斗争的浪花——日本人民反美反岸运动中的小故事

    斗争的浪花
    ——日本人民反美反岸运动中的小故事
    共产党的队伍来了
    千叶县的大学研究工作者加藤史郎写信给“赤旗报”说：我在岸信介官邸前面，看到了共产党的游行队伍，我抑制不住心头的激动。
    秩序井然的行列，迎风招展的红旗，激励人心的口号声。不论是白发老人也好，青年男女也好，都迈着整齐的步伐，斗志昂扬地前进着。整个队伍表现出来的统一意志的力量，使我感到它能够抵挡住任何压力。当时在我的周围，不断地听到这样的声音：“啊，共产党！”、“共产党的队伍来了！”我认为共产党的游行队伍给我们起了示范作用。
    农民的号角
    埼玉县所泽市的日本共产党员们在征集签名反对新日美“安全条约”的时候，访问了一位老农民。他签完名说：“农民的斗争过去一贯是以草席作旗帜，以海螺作号角的。我们坚决反对岸信介的作法。”他还特地从家里把他过去用的海螺找了出来，交给征集签名的共产党员。他说：“你们拿着用吧！”
    从第十八次统一行动开始，传统的农民起义的号角声，就“呜呜”地响彻在所泽附近地区的上空了。
    没有声音的声音
    岸信介曾经把千百万日本人民的示威游行诬蔑为一小部分人干的勾当，并且胡说什么大多数国民虽然都保持沉默，却是赞成日美“安全条约”的。因此他表示“要倾听没有声音的意见”。
    6月18日，东京约四十万群众包围日本国会，举行反对日美军事条约的强大示威时，有几个青年举起一面大旗，上面写着：“我们是没有声音的市民”。顷刻间，在这旗帜下面聚集了一支三千多人的庞大队伍。
    母亲生气了
    在反美反岸的斗争风暴席卷整个日本的时候，有一位中学生想参加示威游行。但他又担心受到他那一向害怕惹事生非的母亲的斥责。尽管如此，他后来还是抑制不住内心的愤怒而瞒着母亲去参加了示威游行。
    母亲知道以后非常生气地把儿子训了一顿。不过，母亲的第一句话却是这样说的：
    “你把妈妈看成了什么样的人，难道反对新日美‘安全条约’这样的好事情，我也会不让你参加吗？”
    婚事和条约
    福井市的一对老年夫妇，很久以来就为自己女儿的亲事操心了。最近，物色了一位对象。两位老人决定安排一个地方让他们见见面，彼此了解一下。下面是这对青年男女一面喝茶，一面闲谈的一段对话。
    女：“近来报纸登什么‘安全条约’‘安全条约’的，您对这个问题怎么看呢？”
    男：“噢，不，对于这些事情我是完全不……”
    女：“报上每天登的那样多，我们怎么能不注意呢？您难道不觉得，如果我们大家都不去管它，就会引起战争吗？” 
    男：“我是一向不卷入这类问题里去的。”
    话不投机，女儿拒绝了这门亲事。
    一个警察的话
    日本共产党宫城县多贺城支部的几位同志，有一天在多贺城的商店街进行挨户访问，征集反对“安全条约”的签名。忽然发现在他们的身后跟来了一个警察。一位党员毫不犹豫地向警察走去，对他说：“我们是多贺城的共产党员，为了反对日美‘安全条约’，请您签个名。”接着，他就向警察说明日美军事同盟条约的危害性。警察说：“你们干的是件好事情，你们好好地干吧！”但是他却不愿意签名，并且解释说：“我是中立的。”
    “在战争与和平两者之间，难道还有什么中立吗？”他被签名征集者直截了当地问道。警察听了这话，说：“由于身份的关系，对于签名这一点，请你原谅我。但是，道理我是懂得的。希望你们好好地加劲干吧。”说罢，他脱帽向人们鞠了个躬，转身走开了。（郑颍达）
