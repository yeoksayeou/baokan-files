A "New Attempt" in American Art

The decline of modern American culture and art is one of the main manifestations of the reaction, decay, and decline of American imperialism. The so-called "writers" and "artists" who serve the interests of the American monopoly bourgeoisie are fantastically "creating" all kinds of deformed and perverted cultural and artistic "works."

In New York City, the so-called "cultural center" of the United States, a group of so-called "avant-garde" artists are currently engaged in a series of "new attempts" in literary and artistic creation.

"Lost and Found" Collage

It is said that among these "artists," "painters" are more popular. There are now 10,000 "artists" in the city engaged in creation, most of whose works have no subject of creation at all. Some works are called "lost and found surrealist" collages. The materials used in this painting are not pigments, oil paints, ink, or canvas, but kitchen utensils, glass bottles, baseballs, old hats, coat hangers, umbrellas, zippers, flashlight bulbs, and even weeds. Many abstract expressionist artworks are exhibited not only in small art galleries, but also in large art galleries and even authoritative modern art museums. Some famous abstract expressionist painters' works sell for as much as 10,000 to 15,000 U.S. dollars each.

Atonal and Thematic "Electronic Music"

Electronic music is also one of the "new attempts" in art. This is a kind of music adapted from the performance of musical instruments or directly manufactured by electronic machines. How do electronic music "composers" create? The "avant-garde" composer Richard Maxfield can be taken as an example. He does not use notation at all, but composes directly on tape. The song has neither melody nor theme. One of his works, "Coughing Music," is made by processing the audience's coughs with an electronic machine. It is said that this "composer" often used his own "works" to assist in teaching music classes in a college, and the sounds used include roars, flapping wings, tremors, whistles, buzzing, and sounds like car horns, woodpeckers, and cheers from stadium audiences, etc.

"Free Form" Dance

Electronic music is also often used to accompany "avant-garde" dance. This is a kind of inexplicably called "free form" dance. A so-called "dancer" named Mati Haim has choreographed two programs called "Psychological Phenomena" and "My Own Experience with the Moon." While dancing, she is barefoot, wearing a white robe, spinning around the room like a madman, sometimes as if chasing someone, and sometimes as if listening to something. While dancing, she muttered: "I see it, I can't see it," "I hear it, I can't hear it," "I know it, I don't know it."

Farce in the "Living Theater"

The Living Theater in New York is also an artistic center for the "avant-garde." It is owned by the Beck couple. The plays staged include "Improvisation Tonight" and "The Connection." The former is a farce. The actors on the stage seem to be improvising and writing the script as they perform, and the "director" Beck himself also goes on stage. He tries to restore order on the stage under the constant scolding of actors pre-arranged among the audience, but is later driven out of the theater by "rebellious" actors. The plot of "The Connection" describes a group of drug addicts gathering together and arguing aimlessly, waiting for the "connection" to arrive to deliver heroin.

### 美国艺术的“新尝试”

    美国艺术的“新尝试”
    美国现代文化艺术的堕落，是美帝国主义的反动、腐朽、没落的主要表现之一。为美国垄断资产阶级利益服务的所谓“作家”和“艺术家”们，正在异想天开地“创作”各种各样畸形的变态的文化艺术“作品”。
    在号称美国“文化中心”的纽约市，一批所谓“先锋派”的艺术家们，最近正在进行一系列文学艺术创作上的“新尝试”。
    “拾物招领”拼贴画
    据说在这些“艺术家”中间，“画家”是比较吃香的。现在全市有一万名“美术家”在进行创作，其中大部分作品根本没有创作的对象，有些作品被称为“拾物招领超现实主义”的拼贴画。这种绘画所使用的材料不是颜料油彩、墨炭和画布，而是厨房用具、玻璃瓶、棒球、旧帽子、衣架、雨伞、拉链、手电筒灯泡，甚至是野草。许多抽象表现派的艺术作品，不仅在小型美术馆展出，也在大型美术馆甚至权威的现代美术博物馆展出。而其中某些著名的抽象表现派画家的作品，单幅售价竟高达一万至一万五千美元之巨。无旋律无主题的“电子音乐”
    电子音乐也是艺术“新尝试”之一。这是一种用电子机来改编乐器演奏或直接用电子机制造的音乐。电子音乐“作曲家”是怎么进行创作的呢？可以把“先锋派”作曲家理查·麦克斯费尔德作为例子。他完全不用记谱，而直接在录音带上作曲，曲子既无旋律也无主题。他的作品之一“咳嗽乐”是把观众的咳嗽声录音后由电子机加工而成的。据说这位“作曲家”在一个学院教音乐课时还常拿自己的“作品”来辅助教学，而使用的音响包括咆哮声、翅膀拍击声、颤抖声、哨子声、嗡嗡声以及像汽车喇叭声、啄木鸟声和球场观众喝采声等等。
    “自由形式”的舞蹈
    电子音乐还常常被用来为“先锋派”的舞蹈伴奏。这是一种所谓“自由形式”的莫名其妙的舞蹈。被称为“舞蹈家”的玛蒂·海姆曾编了两个节目，叫“心理现象”和“我自己同月亮的经验”。在舞蹈时，她赤着脚，穿着白色长袍，像疯人似地在室内不停地旋来转去，有时像在追赶什么人，有时又像在倾听什么声音。一边舞，一边又口中念念有词：“我看见了，我看不见了”，“我听见了，我听不见了”，“我知道了，我不知道了”。
    “生活剧院”里的闹剧
    纽约的生活剧院也是“先锋派”的一个艺术中心，它的老板是培克夫妇。上演的剧本包括“今晚即席演奏”和“接头人”。前者是个闹剧，台上的演员好像在随演随编剧，“导演”培克本人也上台。他在不断受到预先布置在观众中间的演员责骂声下力图恢复台上的秩序，但后来被“反叛”的演员赶出剧场。“接头人”的剧情是描写一群吸毒鬼聚在一起时的无聊争吵，等待着送海洛英去的“接头人”的到来。

    这是美国“滴色派”的“大师”波洛克正在“创作”。他把画布铺在地上，提着一桶颜色跑来跑去，一边把颜色乱撒在布上，于是一幅“杰作”就诞生了。
