	Deep Roots and Lush Foliage

	It has been a year and a half since I left the countryside where I was sent to do labor and training. The images of those grassroots cadres, especially the image of the village branch secretary I once worked with, are still vivid in my memory:
	Outside, it was pouring rain, and the roads were so muddy. He didn't wait for the rain to stop before going to the villages to inspect production. His clothes were soaked, and the cold made him shiver slightly, but he continued to move forward. …
	Every day, as soon as dawn broke in the east, he was already out of the house, heading to the fields to meet the morning sun. At night, in order to study production and work, he never went to bed until after midnight. He rested so little, yet his energy was always so abundant, as if he didn't know what fatigue was. Love for the countryside, listening to the Party, simplicity and diligence, that was his portrayal. This village branch secretary was just one of our millions of rural grassroots cadres. However, through him, we could specifically see how our Party was taking root and blossoming among the broad masses. These grassroots cadres lived among the masses, sharing their joys and sorrows, standing together through thick and thin, sharing a common fate, and connected by flesh and blood. They were the bridge and link between the Party and the masses. Through them, the Party implemented its policies and gathered the wisdom of the masses.
	Here's another example: Comrade Zhou Youren, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Gaomiao People's Commune in Hanyang County, Hubei Province. During a major flood, he organized the rescue of three thousand people, allowing the masses to go first because the boat was small, while he himself stayed behind. At this time, the floodwaters continued to rise, and he and a few others climbed onto the top of a tree that was about to be submerged, and were rescued only after two days and two nights. After going to the countryside, he ate, lived, and worked with the masses. When he saw some cadres cooking meals separately, he said, "If we cannot share the joys and sorrows with the masses, how can the masses truly rely on us? If they don't rely on us, how can we do our work well?" Once, he was very sick, and the masses brought things for him to eat, but he refused. Someone became anxious and said, "Secretary Zhou, tell us, what do you want to eat? As long as you say it, you can even have my heart!" But he still politely declined the things the masses sent. Later, the leadership also sent flour and fruit. He said with emotion, "I haven't done anything for the Party and the masses, thank you for the care of the Party and the leadership." But he still asked others to distribute the fruit and flour to the commune members. On snowy days, fearing that some places would be difficult to walk, and that commune members would lack oil, salt, and daily necessities, he disregarded the pain of pleurisy and led more than thirty cadres to carry more than thirty loads, delivering daily necessities to various villages. The masses affectionately called Comrade Zhou Youren "our intimate person."
	The Party is the sun of the people, giving them life and warmth. The reason why our Party is loved by hundreds of millions of people is because it has countless cadres like Zhou Youren who are "intimate" with the masses. They brought the warmth of the Party to the broad masses, allowing the light of the sun to shine into every corner and into the hearts of every person. They worked diligently and conscientiously, willing to be oxen for the people, asking little from others and giving much. They are the intimate people of the masses, good cadres of the Party, and the backbone of the socialist cause.
	Closely linking with the masses is the fine tradition of our Party, and the source of our Party's inexhaustible strength. The more deeply the grassroots cadres go into the masses and into reality, the more vigorously the Party's cause develops. Why can a big tree stand so firmly, be so vibrant, and not be afraid of strong winds and rain? Because it has countless strong roots that are deeply embedded in the soil, absorbing sufficient nutrients. The deeper the roots, the more lush the foliage. This vigorously growing tree is our Party, our socialist cause!

    根深叶茂
　　梅原
    离开下放劳动锻炼的农村，已有一年半了。那些基层干部，特别是我曾经跟随他工作过的那位乡支部书记的形象，是我至今没有忘怀的：
    外面在下着倾盆大雨，道路是那样泥泞，他没等雨停就上各村检查生产去了。衣服已经湿透，寒冷使人微微打颤，但是他继续前进。……
    每天，东方才发出曙光，他就不在屋子里，早已迎着晨曦下地去了。晚上，为了研究生产和工作，不到半夜决不上床。他休息得那样少，可是精力总是那样充沛，好像不知道什么叫做疲劳。热爱农村，听党的话，朴实勤劳，就是他的写照。这位乡支部书记，不过是我们千百万个农村基层干部中的一个。然而，通过他，使我们具体地看到了，我们的党，是怎样在广大群众中扎根开花的。这些基层干部，生活在群众中，和群众同甘苦，共患难，休戚与共，血肉相连。他们是党和群众之间的桥梁和纽带，通过他们，党把政策贯彻下去，又把群众的智慧集中起来。
    这里再举一例：湖北汉阳县高庙人民公社党委副书记周友仁同志。在一次特大洪水中，他组织抢救了三千人脱险，因为船小，自己宁可留下来，让群众先走。这时，洪水不断上涨，他和另外几个人爬在一棵快被淹没的大树顶上，过了两天两夜才获救。他下乡后，和群众同吃同住同劳动，看到有的干部单独煮饭吃时，他就说：“如果我们不能和群众同甘共苦，群众怎么能真正靠拢我们？不靠拢，又怎么能做好工作呢？”有一次他病得很厉害，群众送来东西给他吃，他不要，有人就发急地说：“周书记，你说说吧，要吃什么，只要你开口，要我的心都行啊！”可是他还是婉言谢绝群众送东西去。后来领导上也送来了面粉和水果，他感动地说：“我没有为党、为群众做什么，谢谢党和领导的关怀。”可是他还是叫别人把水果和面粉分给社员吃。下雪天，他恐怕有的地方路不好走，社员们缺油、缺盐、缺日用品，自己不顾肋膜炎的疼痛，带领三十多个干部挑了三十多副担子，把日用品送到各村去。群众亲热地称周友仁同志为“我们的贴心人”。
    党是人民的太阳，它给人以生命和温暖。我们的党之所以受到亿万人民的热爱，就因为它有着无数像周友仁那样同群众“贴心”的干部，他们把党的温暖带给了广大群众，使太阳的光芒照到了每个角落和每个人的心灵里。他们勤勤恳恳地埋头苦干，俯首甘为孺子牛，要求于人的甚少，给予人的甚多。他们是群众的贴心人，党的好干部，社会主义事业的骨干。
    紧密地联系群众，是我们党的优良传统，是使我们党有无穷力量的源泉。基层干部越是深入群众，深入实际，党的事业越是蓬勃发展。大树为什么能那样屹立不动、生气勃勃而不畏狂风和暴雨？因为它有无数壮实的树根深深地扎入了泥土，吸取着充足的养分。根越深叶越茂，这茁壮地生长着的大树，是我们的党、我们的社会主义事业！
