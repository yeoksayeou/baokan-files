    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th - A grand rally commemorating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the border treaty between the German Democratic Republic and Poland was held this afternoon in Magdeburg, German Democratic Republic. The rally was attended by 130,000 people, including more than 800 from Poland.
    The Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, and the delegation of the Polish People's Republic, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Cyrankiewicz, attended the rally.
    Premier Grotewohl said in his speech that the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic will always maintain true friendship. He pointed out that this Oder-Neisse peace border has not separated the working people of the German Democratic Republic and Poland, but has united them more closely.
    Grotewohl pointed out that the militarists and fascists in Bonn, after the disruption of the summit conference, have been stepping up their war preparations policy and expressing even more hatred towards socialist countries. He went on to point out that what is important now is to eliminate the remnants of World War II in West Germany, which requires the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys.
    Cyrankiewicz then spoke at the rally, saying that the Oder-Neisse border line is a line of peace and friendship. He pointed out that there is now a great socialist camp, and socialist countries are ready to jointly resist any acts that undermine peace and violate border security. He emphasized that the eastward path of West German militarists and their supporters has been cut off. On this path, they will only face complete destruction.
    Cyrankiewicz condemned those who are trying to aggravate international tensions and provoke adventurous actions are obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys.
    Cyrankiewicz said that the German Democratic Republic is a powerful factor in the future development of Germany and an obstacle blocking the path of the revived German imperialism in West Germany.

    纪念德波边界条约签订十周年
    德波两国十三万人盛大集会
    格罗提渥和西伦凯维兹斥西德备战政策
    新华社柏林6日电　德意志民主共和国和波兰两国边界条约签订十周年的纪念大会，今天下午在德意志民主共和国马格德堡举行。参加大会的有十三万人，其中有八百多人来自波兰。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和以波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰人民共和国代表团出席了大会。
    格罗提渥总理在会上讲话说，德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国将永远保持真正的友谊。他指出，这个奥得—尼斯和平边界并没有使德意志民主共和国和波兰的劳动人民分开，而是使他们团结得更紧。
    格罗提渥指出，波恩的军国主义者和法西斯分子在政府首脑会议被破坏以后，一直在加紧执行他们的备战政策和更加表露出对社会主义国家的仇恨。他接着指出，现在重要的是在西德消除第二次世界大战的残迹，这就必须同两个德国缔结对德和约。
    西伦凯维兹接着在大会上讲话说，奥得—尼斯边界线是和平与友谊的界线。他指出，现在存在着伟大的社会主义阵营，社会主义国家准备着共同抗击任何破坏和平和侵犯边界安全的行为。他强调说，西德军国主义者和支持他们的人的东进道路被斩断了。在这条道路上，他们只会遭到彻底毁灭。
    西伦凯维兹谴责那些企图加剧国际紧张局势和挑起冒险行动的人们正在阻挠同两个德国签订和约。
    西伦凯维兹说，德意志民主共和国是德国未来发展的强大因素，是阻挡在西德复活的德国帝国主义的道路上的障碍。
