Xinhua News Agency, July 5th, Rio de Janeiro dispatch: The Brazilian court overturned the indictment of the General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, Prestes, and other communist leaders on July 1st. The Brazilian court made the ruling while handling a case from 1948 accusing them of "crimes endangering the security of the regime."

The reactionary Brazilian Dutra government, which was supported by the United States, declared the Communist Party illegal in May 1947. Shortly after, the Brazilian Attorney General issued arrest warrants for Prestes and other communist leaders, falsely accusing them of "contempt of the president," "disturbing social order," and "engaging in subversive activities against the government," among other charges.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th, Rio de Janeiro dispatch: A majority of members of the Legislative Assembly of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are demanding that the Brazilian Communist Party be granted legal status.

Of the fifty-four state legislators, thirty-one have already signed a proposal put forward by Carlos Quintella, a legislator from the National Democratic Union. This proposal requests President Kubitschek to grant the Brazilian Communist Party legal status in order to fully guarantee the rights stipulated in the Constitution and to make freedom of thought a reality.

    巴西法院撤消对巴共领袖的起诉
    里约热内卢州议员要求当局承认巴共合法
    新华社5日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西法院于7月1日撤消了对巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯和其它共产党领导人的起诉。巴西法院是在审处1948年的控告“危害政权安全的罪行”一案时作出裁决的。
    由美国扶植上台的巴西杜特拉反动政府在1947年5月宣布共产党为非法。接着不久，巴西检查总长对普列斯特斯等共产党领袖发出了逮捕令，把“藐视总统”、“扰乱社会秩序”和“进行颠覆政府活动”等等罪名栽在他们身上。
    新华社4日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西里约热内卢州立法议会的多数议员要求使巴西共产党拥有合法地位。
    在五十四名州议员中，已经有三十一人在巴西全国民主联盟议员卡洛斯·金特拉提出的一项建议书上签了名。这个建议书要求库比契克总统使巴西共产党拥有合法地位，以便充分保证宪法所规定的权利并使思想自由成为现实。
