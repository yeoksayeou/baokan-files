To Promote Advanced Experiences, Launch a Large-Scale Mass Movement
Beijing Fengtai Comprehensive Cooperative Boldly Mobilizes the Masses, and Technological Innovations Blossom Everywhere
Leaders of the Beijing Sewing Machine Table Factory Did Not Go Deep Enough into the Masses and Reality, Taking a Detour

According to Beijing Daily News, the Beijing Fengtai District Comprehensive Production Cooperative and the Sewing Machine Table Factory adopted two different approaches in promoting advanced experiences, resulting in two different outcomes.

The Comprehensive Cooperative has implemented a total of 131 innovation projects this year. Among the 41 relatively significant innovation projects, 35 are in normal use, 3 are used intermittently, and 3 are not in use. The Sewing Machine Table Factory has also implemented 131 innovation projects since the beginning of the year. However, among the 41 significant innovation projects, only 8 are in normal use, 1 is used intermittently, and the remaining 32 are not in use.

Why is there such a significant difference in the effectiveness of the technical revolution movement in these two units? The reason is that the leaders of the Comprehensive Cooperative paid attention to mobilizing the masses and had the spirit of going deep into the masses and reality. For example, the box-making workshop successfully trial-produced a hoop-heating machine for the hoop-heating process, replacing the original manual operation. After it was initially put into production, workers were unwilling to use it due to unfamiliarity with the operation. After learning about this situation, the leading cadres immediately went to the hoop-heating process to conduct specific analysis, held continuous discussions with the workers, clarified to everyone that manual operation was labor-intensive, and the efficiency improvement was limited, so revolution must be carried out. They further helped everyone explore new operating methods. As a result, the machine started running, and the daily output of hoop-heating quickly increased from 7,000 to 26,000. This innovation was consolidated. The leading cadres of this cooperative attached great importance to continuously mobilizing the masses to improve and solve technical problems during the promotion and consolidation process. The tack workshop produced a slice machine for making tack heads. Although the efficiency was very high, and the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced, the number of defective products increased, and some workers had concerns. The branch secretary and the workshop director promptly discovered this problem and immediately worked with the workers to study and improve the machine, find out the cause of the defective products. After the improvement, the defective rate quickly dropped from 70% to 0.6%. The daily output increased from 10 jin to 90 jin, and the number of workers producing tacks was reduced from 10 to 4. In the process of going deep into reality to promote advanced experiences, the leading cadres of this cooperative also often paid attention to guiding and helping workers to continuously revolutionize, so that the already successful projects could continue to improve. In the past, the workers in the electromechanical workshop used hand saws to cut asbestos boards, and after sawing, they had to manually grind the saw cuts, which was both labor-intensive and tiring. The workers manufactured a semi-mechanized asbestos board sawing machine, which required four people to operate. The physical labor was reduced, but the efficiency was not significantly improved. During the promotion process, the leadership encouraged and specifically helped everyone to continue to improve and further realize mechanization, which increased the efficiency by four times.

Although the leading cadres of the Sewing Machine Table Factory also went down to understand some production situations in promoting advanced experiences, they did not pay attention to boldly mobilizing and relying on the masses. Therefore, many problems were solved relatively slowly. For example, the workers made a knife grinder on "May Day." Because the machine parts were broken, the leadership did not seize the opportunity to solve the problem, and the newly made machine was put aside. The manual operation that had been liberated was restored to its old state. Recently, the leadership's work style in the Sewing Machine Table Factory has changed. The Party branch seriously reviewed the ideology and work style of the leading cadres and formed five working groups to go deep into the workshops to study the methods of promoting and consolidating technical innovation projects with the workers. It convened a workers' congress to redeploy the work, which inspired everyone's enthusiasm for technical innovation. As a result, problems that had not been resolved for a long time were solved. Twenty-four of the factory's thirty-nine technical innovation projects have been officially put into production, five have not been restored to use due to the lack of motors, and five are being repaired. The production outlook has also undergone great changes.

### 推广先进经验要大搞群众运动  北京丰台综合社放手发动群众技术革新遍地开花结果  北京缝纫机台板厂领导深入群众深入实际不够走了弯路

    推广先进经验要大搞群众运动
    北京丰台综合社放手发动群众技术革新遍地开花结果
    北京缝纫机台板厂领导深入群众深入实际不够走了弯路
    据北京日报消息　北京丰台区综合生产合作社和缝纫机台板厂在推广先进经验过程中，两种作风，两种效果。
    综合社今年以来共实现一百三十一个革新项目。在四十一项比较重大的革新项目中，正常使用的有三十五项，时用时停的有三项，没有使用的有三项。缝纫机台板厂自年初以来也实现了一百三十一件革新项目，在四十一件重大的革新项目中，正常使用的仅有八件，时用时停的有一件，其余三十二件都没有使用。
    这两个单位技术革命运动的效果为什么会有这么大的不同？原来是综合社的领导干部注意发动群众，又有深入群众、深入实际的精神。这个厂制盒车间的烫圈工序试制成功了一台烫圈机，代替原来的手工操作。最初投入生产以后，由于操作不习惯，工人不愿意用；领导干部了解这一情况以后，立即到烫圈工序去进行具体分析，连续和工人一起座谈，使大家明确了手工操作劳动强度大，效率提高又有一定的限度，必须进行革命，并且进一步帮助大家摸索出了新的操作方法，结果机器开动起来了，烫圈的日产量很快由七千个上升到两万六千个，这一项革新巩固下来了。这个社的领导干部很重视在推广和巩固的过程中，不断发动群众改进和解决技术问题。图钉车间制成的作图钉帽的切片机，虽然效率很高，工人的劳动强度也大大降低，但是废品增多了，部分工人有了顾虑。支部书记和车间主任及时发现了这个问题，立即和工人一起研究改进，找出了出废品的原因，改进以后，废品率很快就由70％下降到了0.6％。日产量由十斤提高到九十斤，生产图钉的工人也由十个人减少到四个人。在深入实际抓推广先进经验的过程中，这个社的领导干部还经常注意引导和帮助工人不断革命，使已经成功了的项目继续提高。机电车间的职工过去用手工锯石棉板，锯完以后还要用手工磨平锯口，又费工又累人。工人制造了一台半机械化锯石棉板机，需用四个人来操作，体力劳动减轻了，效率却提高得不显著。在推广中领导上就鼓励和具体帮助大家继续改进，进一步实现机械化，效率提高了四倍。
    缝纫机台板厂的领导干部在推广先进经验工作中，虽然也下去了解一些生产情况，但是没有注意放手发动群众和依靠群众，因此，许多问题解决得比较缓慢。例如，工人在“五一”制成了磨刀机，因为机器零件坏了，领导上没有抓紧解决，刚做好的机器也就被搁置在一边了，曾经解放了的手工操作又恢复了老样。最近缝纫机台板厂领导工作作风有了转变。这个厂的党支部认真地检查了领导干部的思想和作风，并且组成五个工作组深入车间，同工人一起研究推广和巩固技术革新项目的办法，召开职工大会重新作了部署，鼓舞了大家的技术革新热情，致使过去长时间没解决的问题，得到了解决。全厂三十九项技术革新项目，已经有二十四项正式投入生产，有五项因为没有电动机尚未恢复使用，有五项正在修复中。生产面貌也有了很大的变化。
