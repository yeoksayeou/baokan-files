Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 12th: Party committee secretaries at all levels in Xinjiang's pastoral areas are leading large numbers of cadres deep into pastoral areas and livestock herds, living, eating, and grazing alongside herders, focusing on re-mating small livestock and breeding large livestock, intensifying efforts to fatten livestock in summer and protect young animals, striving to complete the livestock production increase plan. By the end of June, over 1.6 million sheep in the region had been re-mated, and over 400,000 large livestock had been bred. These re-mated sheep will produce lambs again within this year.

Since last winter and this spring, livestock in major pastoral areas in northern Xinjiang, such as Ili, Tacheng, and Altay, suffered from four strong cold waves and multiple snowstorms during winter grazing and migration to spring pastures. In late March, heavy snow fell in the Emin River Valley in Tacheng, and the temperature warmed up slowly this year. Around the beginning of summer, some pastures in Xinjiang still had snow cover. However, thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels and the emphasis on disaster resistance and livestock protection, livestock losses were greatly reduced. More than 4 million lambs and young livestock were raised in the first half of the year.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's livestock production increase plan despite the disaster, Party committees in major pastoral areas have intensified their leadership in current animal husbandry, regarding the increase of the breeding rate of small livestock as the key to increasing production this year, making it possible for ewes suitable for breeding to produce lambs again within the year. More than 3,000 full-time animal husbandry leading cadres at the county level and above throughout the region have gone to work on the grasslands. Secretaries of Party organizations at all levels have also led large numbers of cadres to delve into pastures, livestock herds, breeding stations, and livestock pens, living, eating, and grazing alongside hundreds of thousands of herders. In Altay, Tacheng, Kizilsu, Bayingolin, Ili and other prefectures and autonomous prefectures, cadres invested in the animal husbandry front account for more than 20% of the total number of cadres. According to the characteristics of the scattered seasonal pastures and the high mobility of herders and livestock herds, the animal husbandry headquarters (groups) at all levels in Bortala Autonomous Prefecture have all moved to pastoral areas to work, moving with the livestock herds, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Comrade Gao Ming, First Secretary of the Nileke County Party Committee, which is mainly engaged in animal husbandry, led 50% of the county-level cadres to go deep into the grassroots level, promoting the leading roles of commune and brigade-level cadres as herders and breeders, which led to a high tide of breeding large and small livestock in the county in mid-June.

During the intensive breeding, all localities also seized the good season of lush summer grass to focus on summer fattening. All pastoral areas have generally strengthened grazing and feeding management, adjusted livestock herds according to livestock types and fatness, allocated herders and distributed pastures according to livestock herds, and increased the grass-eating time and grass-eating volume of livestock by grazing early and returning late. After strengthening grazing management, all of the more than 59,000 ewes of appropriate age in Yanqi Hui Autonomous County are strong and healthy, and all have been re-mated. In order to strive for the full survival and strength of lambs produced by mated sheep in winter and the safe overwintering of various livestock, all localities have also broken with convention, starting to harvest and store winter grass and rush to build livestock sheds in mid-to-late June ahead of schedule. The planting area of feed has also been greatly expanded throughout the region. Tacheng Prefecture has planted 110,000 mu of feed and 51,000 mu of forage, respectively, one to eight times more than last year. (Attached picture)

　　新疆牧区狠抓牲畜配种工作
　　力争完成畜牧业增产计划
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆牧区各级党委书记正领导大批干部，深入牧区、深入畜群，和牧民同吃同住同放牧，突击小畜复配和大畜配种，大抓夏膘和保畜护幼工作，力争完成畜牧业增产计划。到6月底，全区复配羊只已达一百六十多万头，大畜配种四十多万头。这些已复配的羊只都将在今年内再产一次羔。
    去冬今春以来，新疆北部的伊犁、塔城、阿勒泰等主要牧区的牲畜，在冬牧场过冬和往春牧场转移途中，曾先后受到四次强烈寒潮和多次暴风雪的袭击，塔城额敏河谷一带3月下旬又降大雪，今年气温也普遍回暖迟，立夏前后全疆有的牧场仍有积雪。但是，由于各级党委加强了领导，狠抓抗灾保畜，因而大大减少了牲畜损失，上半年共接育羊羔和产仔畜四百多万头。
    为了保证受灾后仍能完成今年牲畜增产计划，各主要牧区党委狠抓当前畜牧业的领导，把提高小畜繁殖率当作今年增产的关键，尽可能使有条件配种的母羊在年内再产一次羔。全区县以上畜牧业专职领导干部已有三千多人赴草原工作，各级党组织书记也率领大批干部深入牧场、畜群、配种站、牲畜圈棚，和数十万牧民同吃同住同放牧。阿勒泰、塔城、克孜勒苏、巴音郭楞、伊犁等专区和自治州投入畜牧战线的干部占干部总数的20％以上。博尔塔拉自治州各级畜牧业指挥部（组），根据四季草场分散、牧工和畜群流动性大的特点，已全部搬往牧区办公、随畜群转移，及时发现问题、解决问题。以牧业为主的尼勒克县县委第一书记高明同志，带领50％的县级干部深入基层后，推动了公社、大队级干部都带头当牧工，带头配种，使全县在6月中旬掀起了大小畜配种高潮。
    各地在突击配种中，并抓住当前夏草丰茂的大好季节，大抓夏膘。各牧区普遍加强了牧放饲养管理，因牲畜种类和膘度调整畜群，因畜群调配放牧员和分配草场，早出放晚收牧，增加牲畜的采草时间和采草量。焉耆回族自治县加强牧放管理后，全县五万九千多只适龄母羊只只健壮，全部进行了复配。为了力争已配羊只冬季产羔全活全壮和各种牲畜安全越冬，各地还打破常规，提前在6月中下旬开始打储冬草，抢盖圈棚。全区饲料种植面积也大大扩大，塔城专区已种植饲料十一万亩，饲草五万一千亩，分别比去年扩大一倍到八倍。（附图片）
