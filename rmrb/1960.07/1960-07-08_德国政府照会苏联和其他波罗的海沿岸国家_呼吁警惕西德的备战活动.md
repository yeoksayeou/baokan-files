Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 7th - The government of the German Democratic Republic has delivered a note to the governments of the Soviet Union and other Baltic Sea countries, exposing West Germany's war preparations in the Baltic Sea region.

The note points out that the West German ruling clique has led the Western European Union to make a resolution allowing West Germany to build warships with a displacement of five to six thousand tons and submarines with a displacement of one thousand tons. The West German government has also openly stated that it is preparing to equip these ships with rockets and atomic weapons.

The note indicates that in 1959, the West German navy possessed seventeen fleets. It is stipulated that twenty-two fleets will be established by 1963. The West German government also intends to establish naval bases in many Baltic Sea countries.

The German Democratic Republic suggests to the Soviet Union and other Baltic Sea countries that they conclude bilateral and multilateral treaties of friendship and cooperation, or non-aggression treaties, to strengthen peace in the Baltic Sea region and make the Baltic Sea a sea of peace. The note concludes by saying that the German Democratic Republic believes that in the face of the danger of atomic war created by German militarism, no Baltic Sea country should evade taking the necessary steps to ensure peace.

    德国政府照会苏联和其他波罗的海沿岸国家
    呼吁警惕西德的备战活动
    新华社柏林7日电　德意志民主共和国政府分别递交苏联和其他波罗的海的沿岸国家政府一份照会，揭露西德在波罗的海地区进行战争准备。
    照会指出，西德统治集团已使西欧联盟作出决议，允许西德建造排水量为五千到六千吨的军舰和排水量达一千吨的潜水艇。西德政府还公然声称准备用火箭和原子武器装备这些舰艇。
    照会指出，1959年西德海军拥有十七个舰队。到1963年规定建立二十二个舰队。西德政府还打算在许多波罗的海国家建立海军基地。
    德意志民主共和国向苏联和其他波罗的海国家建议缔结双边和多边友好和合作条约，或互不侵犯条约，来加强波罗的海地区的和平，使波罗的海成为和平的海。照会最后说，德意志民主共和国认为，面临德国军国主义制造的原子战争的危险，任何一个波罗的海沿岸国家都不应该规避采取保障和平所必须的步骤。
