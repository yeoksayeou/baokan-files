How We Achieved Consecutive Years of Increased Wheat Production
Jiao Dexiu, First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Our Xiangyang Prefecture has once again achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops this year. The characteristic of this year's bumper harvest is that whether in the mountains or outside, in the hills or plains, in paddy fields or river lands, the wheat has grown very well. The total area of summer crops in the prefecture is 12 million mu, an increase of 2 million mu over last year, including more than 8 million mu of wheat and more than 4 million mu of miscellaneous grains such as broad beans, peas, and barley. Judging from the actual yields currently being assessed, the total output is higher than the summer of 1959, the year of the Great Leap Forward. The summer grain procurement task this year is 700 million jin. As of June 22, more than 730 million jin had been put into storage, an increase of 23% compared with the 590 million jin procured in the summer of last year; at the same time, the task was completed 25 days earlier than last year. This is a manifestation of the tremendous superiority of the people's communes, the victory of the Party's General Line, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Good Sowing is Fundamental

"Sow good wheat, and you will reap a good autumn." The facts in our region over the years have proved that as long as wheat is sown well, and field management is followed up in a timely manner, increased production and a bumper harvest can be achieved. Conversely, if the sowing is not good, resulting in congenital deficiencies in the seedlings or missing seedlings and broken rows, then even if other measures are taken to remedy the situation later, although they will play a certain role, they cannot solve the fundamental problem. This is like building a house, where the foundation must be laid well first. If the foundation is not well laid, no matter how thick the walls are added, they will not be reliable.

What does it mean to sow well? Good sowing means that the land is plowed deeply, leveled smoothly, has sufficient base fertilizer, is sown at the right time, and the seedlings emerge evenly and strongly. Among these, deep plowing is the most important link. Practice has proved that wherever this has been done, large-scale balanced increases in production can be achieved. Zhaoyang County has achieved large-scale balanced increases in wheat production for consecutive years precisely because it has firmly grasped the key step of deep plowing and land preparation. The masses say, "An extra inch of deep plowing is equivalent to an extra application of manure." With the same land and the same management, the difference in yield is significant due to the different depths of plowing and land preparation. Even land with poor soil quality, because it is plowed deeply and prepared well, can catch up with the yield of land with good soil quality that has not been deeply plowed. The Eighth Team of the Duban Production Brigade of the Xiongji Commune in Zhaoyang has land that is not very good. Of the 190 mu of wheat, 110 mu are "Shao Chong Tian" (paddy fields with heavy clay soil). Because the land is plowed deeply and prepared well, the yield every year is higher than other teams. This year, the average yield of wheat per mu reached 630 jin. The First Team has 150 mu of wheat, of which 120 mu are sandy soil, which retains moisture and resists drought, and is called "Jian Zi Tian" (high-yielding land) by the masses. However, because it was not deeply plowed, this year it only yielded 380 jin per mu.

Prepare for the Next Season in the Previous Season

"Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles you are not sure of winning." Chairman Mao's great military strategic thinking is equally applicable to agricultural production. Specifically, it means preparing everything early, "one early means a hundred early," striving for the initiative. This includes ideological preparation, tool preparation, technical preparation, and even preparing for the next season in the previous season. Based on the characteristics of our region as a double-cropping area of rice and wheat, and cotton and wheat, we considered the planting of autumn crops when planting major autumn crops. More than 5 million mu of rice are planted throughout the region, 90% of which are medium rice. The reason is that medium rice matures early, which is convenient for early plowing and deep plowing for wheat planting. At the time of autumn planting, the area of wheat stubble cotton was determined, and wide and narrow rows were reserved in the wheat fields to prepare for cotton planting in the second year. In short, we must look at next year this year, prepare for the next season in the previous season, and try to make the major autumn crops mature earlier, so that we can start early, plow deeply early, seize the season, and sow wheat at the right time.

In order to ensure that wheat is sown well at the right time, during the field management period after the autumn crops are planted, various preparations for autumn sowing were started. At the end of June last year, we convened an autumn sowing meeting attended by the first secretaries of the county Party committees, the heads of the county agricultural bureaus, technicians, and wheat high-yield models, earnestly summarized the high-yield experience of summer crops, formulated an autumn sowing plan, and focused on identifying advanced deep-plowing tools and studying the problems of deep plowing immediately after harvesting and preparing sufficient fertilizer. After the meeting, the counties carried out extensive mass discussions, and fixed 45,000 iron and carpenters to specialize in manufacturing tools for autumn plowing and autumn sowing; at the same time, 450,000 deep plowing hands and strip sowing hands were trained. Only with early preparation, deep and thorough ideological mobilization of cadres and the masses, and concrete preparation of various tasks can various productions be done better.

Launch a Mass Movement

In mid-August last year, when deep plowing of land had just begun, due to the fact that it had not rained for more than 70 days, some well-off middle peasants reflected: "The sky is dry and the ground is hard, and deep plowing is impossible," and shouted difficulties. The slogan we put forward at the time was: "Great difficulties cannot withstand the great power of the people's communes, hard ground is not harder than the firm determination of the revolutionary people, plow if you can plow, and if you can't plow, dig with iron hoes." Practice has proved that in the face of difficulties, as long as the leadership has great determination and lets go of mobilizing the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Zhaoyang County did a relatively good job. In deep plowing of land, they adopted the methods of concentrating livestock power, concentrating labor, concentrating deep plowing tools, and concentrating leadership, and under the principle of adhering to mutual benefit, organized large-scale operations. If they could not plow, they used iron hoes to dig, and if they could not dig, they used iron shovels and wooden sticks to insert into the dry cracked soil, lifting them piece by piece, which was both fast and deep. After the autumn crops were harvested and before autumn sowing began, they took advantage of the good opportunity of the land leisure period, combined with deep plowing of land, and carried out large-scale land leveling, land consolidation, and gardening, and carried out large-scale construction of roads and field operation roads. The prefectural Party committee fully promoted Zhaoyang County's approach, thus setting off a climax of plowing and preparing land throughout the prefecture. According to statistics, during this period, the region organized a total of 600,000 livestock and 1 million laborers, and invested in this battle. In just two months, more than 8 million mu of wheat land were deeply plowed, generally reaching 6 to 8 inches, and about 30% of the land reached about 1 foot. In order to apply sufficient base fertilizer, from the time of hanging up the hoe to the time of sowing wheat, the masses were mobilized to cut artemisia and compost green manure. Last year, a total of 1.45 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated, more than 400 million dan more than in the same period of autumn sowing in 1958.

Manage Well and Harvest Well to Seize Bumper Harvests

Sowing is the foundation, and management is the guarantee. Only good sowing and good management can achieve the goal of high yield. On the basis of good sowing, in order to manage well, we established a special team to strengthen field management. The center of field management is deep hoeing and heavy harrowing, and applying top dressing in stages. Only deep hoeing and heavy harrowing can loosen the soil and retain moisture, eliminate weeds, prevent seedling rust roots, and promote wheat growth; only timely top dressing in stages can make wheat effectively tiller more, and achieve the goal of more spikes, larger spikes, and full grains.

Although we proposed during sowing that we should eliminate the three types of seedlings in the sowing period and achieve the requirements of balanced and large-scale increases in production, "three types of seedlings" will still appear after sowing. We must constantly classify and rank them, and constantly eliminate the three types of seedlings. After eliminating the old three types of seedlings, and improving one step, new three types of seedlings will appear. If they appear again, we will eliminate them again. The process of eliminating the three types of seedlings is the process of processing and cultivating. In the process of constantly eliminating the three types of seedlings, we launched a large-scale balanced production increase movement of "six catching up" and "six reforming." The "six catching up" are: the backward catching up with the advanced, the low-yielding catching up with the high-yielding, the uplands catching up with the river lands, the mountainous areas catching up with the plains, the miscellaneous grains catching up with the staple grains, and the wasteland (i.e., reclaimed land) catching up with the old land; the "six reforming" are: reforming the backward teams, backward ridges, backward mountains, backward flushes, backward fans, and backward seedlings. Under the slogan of "six catching up" and "six reforming," the region organized 200,000 cadres to engage in high-yield experimental fields in backward teams and low-yielding areas. The region engaged in high-yield ridge, high-yield fan, and high-yield mountain areas of 300,000 mu, and drove 700,000 masses to also engage in 1.4 million mu of experimental fields. This played a positive role in promoting large-scale balanced increases in production.

The word "harvest" is the last hurdle. Good sowing and good management must also be harvested well in order to achieve both high yield and bumper harvest. The area of summer crops in the region is large, the maturity period is relatively consistent, and it is also in the rainy season. If it is not grasped tightly, the goal of high yield and bumper harvest cannot be achieved. There was once this lesson in 1956. Since that time, we have paid attention to this issue. To achieve this, it is necessary to prepare harvesting, transportation, threshing and other tools as early as possible, expand the threshing ground, gradually build warehouses, etc., and do everything that can be done before the wheat matures as early as possible. Once the wheat matures, we can concentrate our efforts to rush to harvest and rush to plant, harvest one piece and plant one piece, so that both harvesting and planting are good. Early planting also creates conditions for a bumper autumn harvest.

Lay a Good Foundation for Increased Production in the Summer of Next Year

Although our region has achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops this year, there are still many shortcomings and great potential that need to be further overcome and tapped, such as the planting area is still a bit small, the fertilizer is still not enough, the phenomenon of imbalance still exists, the seeds are a bit mixed, and winter field management is not enough. At present, we are combining the field management of major autumn crops, summarizing the high-yield experience of this year's summer crops from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and formulating plans and measures for this year's winter sowing. The prefectural Party committee has made a preliminary discussion on this year's winter sowing plan, and everything is based on the requirements of expanding the autumn sowing area, increasing the yield per mu, and increasing the total output. First, we must further expand the autumn sowing area. It is planned to expand the area by another 3 million mu of high-yield crops - potatoes - on the basis of the 12 million mu of summer crops this year. In order to realize this plan, we will seize the gap between the busy season of cattle in July and August, and adopt a method combining grazing and reclamation to reclaim 2.5 million mu to 3 million mu of wasteland as early as possible. Second, we will extract 70% of the labor force, and while carrying out large-scale drought resistance, seedling protection, and large-scale field management, we will prepare autumn sowing fertilizer. It is planned to apply an average of 100 to 150 dan of base fertilizer per mu in combination with deep plowing to eliminate white seeds from being planted in the ground. Third, we will repair and remodel tools as early as possible and strengthen the fattening of cattle. When the autumn crops mature, we will cut one piece and plow one piece, deeply plow the more than 8 million mu of wheat land once, and timely carry out the wheat sowing work in accordance with the requirements, laying a good foundation for striving for a greater bumper harvest in the summer of next year.

    我们是怎样获得小麦连年增产的
    中共襄阳地委第一书记　焦德秀
    我们襄阳专区今年的夏收作物又获得了丰收。今年丰收的特点是不论山里山外、丘陵平原、水田河地，小麦长得都很好。全区夏收作物面积一千二百万亩，比去年扩大二百万亩，其中小麦八百多万亩，蚕豆、豌豆、大麦等杂粮四百多万亩。从当前实打的结果来看，总产量比大跃进的1959年夏季多。今年夏季征购任务七亿斤，到6月22日，已经入库七亿三千多万斤，比去年夏季征购五亿九千多万斤增加23％；同时比去年提早二十五天完成了任务。这是人民公社巨大优越性的表现，是党的总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    种好是根本
    “种好的麦子，作出来的秋”，我区历年来的事实证明，小麦只要种好了，再加上田间管理及时跟上，就能够增产丰收。相反，如果种的不好，造成苗子先天不足，或缺苗断垅，以后再采取其他措施挽救，虽然也会起到一定的作用，但不能解决根本问题。这就像盖房子必须先打好基础一样，根基没打好，墙再加的厚，也是靠不住的。
    什么叫种好呢？所谓好，就是地犁的深，整的平，底肥足，种的适时，苗子出的整齐、肥壮。其中深耕又是最主要的一环。实践证明，凡是这样作了的，就能取得大面积的平衡增产。枣阳县小麦连年获得大面积的平衡增产，就是突出的抓住了深翻整地这一手。群众说：“深耕多一寸，抵上一道粪”。同等的土地，同样的管理，因为深耕整地不同，产量高低悬殊很大。甚至土质差的地，因为地犁的深，整的好，也会赶上土质虽好而没有进行深耕的产量。枣阳熊集公社杜畈生产队第八小队，土地并不好，一百九十亩小麦，其中土质粘重的“稍冲田”，就有一百一十亩，由于地犁的深，整的好，每年产量都比别队高，今年的麦子平均亩产达到六百三十斤，第一小队一百五十亩小麦，其中一百二十亩是沙土田，保墒耐旱，群众称之为“尖子田”，就是因为没有深耕，今年每亩只收三百八十斤。
    上季为下季做好准备
    “不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”，毛主席这个伟大的军事战略思想，在农业生产上也同样适用。具体说就是要一切提早准备，“一早百早”，力争主动。这里边包括思想准备、工具准备、技术准备，以至上一季就为下一季准备。根据我区是稻麦两熟、棉麦两熟地区的特点，我们在播种大秋作物的时候，就考虑到秋种作物的种植。全区栽五百多万亩水稻，90％都种中稻，原因就是中稻熟的早，便于早耕、深耕种麦。在秋种的时候，就把麦茬棉花的面积确定下来，在麦地里留好宽窄行，给第二年种棉花作好准备。总之，今年必须看到明年，上一季必须为下一季作好准备，并且尽量使大秋作物提早成熟，这样才能提早动手，早深耕，抢住季节，适时播种小麦。
    为了保证适时把小麦种好，在大秋作物种完之后的田间管理期间，就开始秋种的各项准备工作。去年6月底，我们就召开了各县委第一书记、县农业局长、技术员和小麦丰产模范参加的秋种会议，认真总结了夏收作物的丰产经验，制定了秋种规划，并着重鉴定了先进深耕工具，研究了随收随深耕和备足肥料等问题。会后，各县开展了广泛的群众性的酝酿讨论，并固定四万五千个铁、木匠，专门为秋耕秋种制造工具；同时训练深耕手和条播手四十五万人。只有准备的早，干部、群众的思想发动的深透，各项工作准备的具体，各项生产才能搞得更好。
    大搞群众运动
    去年8月中旬，深翻土地刚开始的时候，由于七十多天没有落雨，曾有部分富裕中农反映：“天干地硬，深耕不成”，喊叫困难。我们当时提出的口号是：“困难大抵不住人民公社的威力大，地硬硬不过革命人民的坚强决心，能犁则犁，不能犁就用铁铣挖”的口号。实践证明，在困难面前，只要领导决心大，放手发动群众，没有克服不了的困难。枣阳县作的比较好，他们在深翻土地中，采取了集中畜力，集中劳力，集中深耕工具，集中领导，在坚持互利的原则下，组织大兵团作战，犁不动就用铁铣挖，挖不动就用铁锹、木棍插在干裂的土缝里，一块一块的掀，既掀的快，又翻的深。大秋作物收完之后，秋种开始之前，他们又乘土地休闲期的大好时机，结合深翻土地，大搞土地平整、土地连片和园田化，大搞修建公路和田间作业道，地委全面推广枣阳县这种作法，从而在全区范围内掀起了翻整土地的高潮。据统计，在这期间，全区共组织了六十万头牲畜，一百万劳动力，投入了这一战斗，仅两个月的时间，八百多万亩小麦地都深耕了，一般都达到六寸到八寸，约有30％的土地达到一尺左右。为了施足底肥，从挂锄到种麦这一段时间，发动群众，打青蒿、沤绿肥，去年共积肥十四亿五千万担，比1958年秋种的同期多四亿多担。
    管好收好夺丰收
    种是基础，管是保证。种好管好才能达到丰产的目的。在种好的基础上，为了管好，我们建立了专门班子，加强田间管理。田间管理的中心，是深锄重耙，分期追肥。只有深锄重耙，才能松土保墒，消灭杂草，防止苗子锈根，促使小麦生长；只有分期适时追肥，才能使小麦有效分蘖多，达到穗多、穗大、籽粒饱满的目的。
    我们在种的时候，虽然就提出要把三类苗消灭在播种期中，实现平衡大增产的要求，但种下以后，还会出现“三类苗”，必须不断地分类排队，不断地消灭三类苗，消灭了旧的三类苗，提高一步，又会出现新的三类苗。再出现，再消灭。消灭三类苗的过程，就是加工培育的过程。我们在不断消灭三类苗当中，开展了“六赶”“六改”的大面积平衡增产运动，“六赶”是：后进赶先进，低产赶高产，岗地赶河地，山区赶平原，杂粮赶主粮，荒田（即开荒田）赶老田；“六改”是：改造落后队、落后岗、落后山、落后冲、落后畈、落后苗。在这“六赶”“六改”的口号下，全区组织了二十万干部，到后进队和低产地区搞丰产试验田，全区共搞丰产岗、丰产畈、丰产山面积达三十万亩，带动七十万群众也搞了一百四十万亩试验田。这对推动大面积的平衡增产起了积极的作用。
    “收”字是最后的一关。种好管好，还要收好，才能既丰产又丰收。全区夏收作物面积大，成熟期比较一致，又是处在雨季，如果抓的不紧，就达不到丰产丰收的目的。1956年曾经有过这个教训。从那个时候起，我们就注意了这个问题。要作到这一点，就是要及早准备好收割、运输、脱粒等工具，扩大打谷场，逐步修盖仓房等，并把能在麦熟以前作的事情，尽力提前作好，一旦麦子成熟，就可集中力量，进行抢收抢种，熟一块割一块种一块，作到收种两好。种的早，又给秋季丰收创造了条件。
    为明年夏季增产打好基础
    我区今年夏收作物虽然获得了大丰收，但还有不少的缺点和很大的潜力，需要进一步克服和挖掘，如播种面积还有点少，肥料施的还不足，不平衡的现象仍然存在，种子有点杂，冬季田间管理不够等。目前，我们正在结合大秋作物的田间管理，自上而下、自下而上地总结今年夏收作物的丰产经验，制定今年冬播的规划和措施。地委对今年的冬播规划已经作了初步讨论，一切本着扩大秋播面积、提高单产，增加总产这一要求出发。首先要进一步扩大秋播面积，计划在今年夏收作物面积一千二百万亩的基础上，再扩大三百万亩高产作物——洋芋。为了实现这个计划，从现在起就抓住7、8月间的牛闲空隙，采取放牧与开荒相结合的方法，提早开垦二百五十万亩到三百万亩荒地。再是抽出70％的劳力，在大搞抗旱、保苗，大搞田间管理的同时，准备秋播肥料，计划结合深耕每亩平均施底肥一百到一百五十担，消灭白籽下地。三是及早修理改制工具和加强耕牛催膘等工作，等到秋季庄稼一熟，就割一块，犁一块，把八百多万亩小麦地普遍深翻一次，及时地按照要求地把小麦播种工作作好，为争取明年夏季更大丰收打好基础。
