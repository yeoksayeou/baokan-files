Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Montevideo Dispatch: The Uruguayan "People's Paper" published an editorial on the 26th, stating: The events in Cuba demonstrate that the people of a country aspiring to liberation can count on the full support of the socialist camp. Socialist countries have become a bastion for the people of the world in their struggle for independence and freedom. "In the current world, socialism is like the rising sun, while capitalism in its imperialist stage is like the setting sun."

The editorial said that the Soviet Union's purchase of Cuban sugar and its sale of oil to Cuba are powerful blows to the economic aggression against Cuba by American imperialism. The signing of a trade agreement between Cuba and the People's Republic of China "is another important action in the Cuban people's determination to fight for economic liberation."

The editorial pointed out that through the loans provided by China, Cuba will be able to obtain the machinery and equipment it needs from China. This shows that "in the current world, socialist countries have become a pillar for promoting the prosperity of industry and agriculture in underdeveloped countries." It said that the era of imperialism enslaving dependent and semi-colonial countries and causing them to stagnate in backwardness forever is over.

    乌拉圭“人民报”发表社论
    赞扬社会主义国家支持古巴
    新华社27日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭“人民报”在26日发表社论说：古巴的事件表明，一个渴望获得解放的国家的人民可以指靠社会主义阵营的完全支持。社会主义国家已经成为全世界人民为争取独立和自由而斗争的堡垒。“在目前的世界上，社会主义好像初升的太阳，而处在帝国主义阶段的资本主义却如日薄西山”。
    社论说，苏联购买古巴的食糖和向古巴出售石油，是对美帝国主义对古巴的经济侵略的有力打击。古巴和中华人民共和国签订贸易协定，“是古巴人民决心为争取经济解放而斗争的另一个重要行动”。
    社论指出，古巴通过中国提供的贷款，将可以从中国取得它所需要的机器设备。这表明，“在目前的世界上，社会主义国家已经成为促进不发达国家工业和农业繁荣的支柱。”它说，帝国主义奴役附属国和半殖民地国家并且使它们永远停滞于落后状态的时代已经结束了。
