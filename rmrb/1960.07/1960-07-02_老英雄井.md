    Old Hero Well
    Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Correspondence Group
    In every corner of our great motherland, miracles can be found everywhere, and the light of communist thought shines everywhere.
    Recently, in the Nantong Coal Mine, people are vying to spread the heroic deeds of twelve retired veteran workers. These twelve old heroes are: Xia Guotai, Xian Bincheng, Zhao Huaxuan, Chen Yinsan, Du Zhenghan, Yang Shuqing, Zhang Yinzhou, Yin Peiqing, Zhao Runqing, Fu Shuku, Wang Qiquan, and Wang Haiyun. In the old society, they suffered long-term torment and endured all kinds of hardships. After liberation, the Party gave them new life, allowing them to experience unparalleled warmth and happiness. To take care of their health, the Party organized their retirement this year, allowing them to enjoy their happy later years. However, their red hearts, eager to change our country's "poor and blank" state as soon as possible, are beating fiercely. They can't stay idle or calm down. As long as they can work for one more day, they will labor for socialist construction for one more day. Therefore, they started a mine empty-handed, practicing diligence and thrift. They did not ask the state for a single penny, a single piece of equipment, or an inch of material. They built two small coal kilns in just eight days. In the past month, they have produced more than 800 tons of raw coal for the country, with an average work efficiency of 2.3 tons, setting up a glorious red banner among the coal mine workers in the city.
    Cannot Calm Down
    One night in late March, Xian Bincheng, a seventh-grade coal miner, was very uneasy on his way home from a retirement study session. He recalled how he was conscripted by the Kuomintang reactionaries more than twenty years ago and forced to come to this mine, where he lived a dark and hopeless life of eating vegetable roots and sleeping on bamboo beds. He thought of his happy and enjoyable later years today; of the rapid progress of the motherland's construction and the increasing need for coal and coke; and of the scene of his colleagues in the whole mine fighting all night to seize coal and protect steel… The more he thought, the more he loved the new society, and the more he felt his responsibility was great. "As long as I can work for one day, I will work for socialism for one day." He made up his mind to build a small coal kiln for the country to increase coal production.
    When he told his plan to Xia Guotai, an old worker and Communist Party member who participated in the retirement study with him, Xia Guotai laughed and said: How did we have the same idea? I wanted to do this a long time ago, and I was thinking of uniting more partners to do it, because there is strength in numbers!
    One morning in April, a group of retired veteran workers gathered in a teahouse near the Nantong Coal Mine. People were discussing the construction of a small coal kiln around Xia Guotai!
    "Retiring and just playing is really not comfortable. How can a coal miner not mine coal?"
    "For the early realization of communism, for the happiness of future generations, we must go if we can, we must do it…"
    "Production is so tight, seeing that the production of coal cannot keep up with the needs of the country, I feel anxious." Chen Yinsan, who usually doesn't talk much, said as if he had opened the floodgates: "There is no empty land under the sky, and no idle people in the world. People need to eat, steel needs coal to smelt, everyone is making a great leap forward, I think we should resolutely build a small native kiln to help the country increase coal production…"
    The old worker Zhao Huaxuan, who had not spoken, already had a flushed face. He stood up like a young man and waved his fist, saying: "Let's do it, let's do it right away!"
    An Application
    In recent days, Xia Guotai and Xian Bincheng, Zhao Huaxuan, and Wang Haiyun, three veteran coal miners, have been climbing over mountains and hills, visiting one coal kiln after another, to select a kiln site. Originally, based on their rich experience in coal mining for twenty or thirty years, choosing a mountain and selecting a kiln could be quickly decided; but things were not so simple. In order to seize coal and protect steel and produce coal as soon as possible, and without increasing the burden on the country, they decided on the following principles for selecting a kiln: First, the coal reserves should be large and the transportation should be convenient; second, coal can be produced quickly, in a matter of days; third, no equipment and materials from the country are needed; fourth, it should be suitable for the characteristics of old workers, with short transportation distances and no uphill or downhill slopes. Many coal mines they chose did not fully meet the conditions.
    When they came to Dazhulin, they were first attracted by the thousands of tons of open-pit coal piled up on the mountain.
    "How about No. 4 pit? There's a lot of coal! And it fully meets our principles." Wang Haiyun said excitedly.
    But everyone knows that the No. 4 coal kiln was built during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, but not much coal was extracted before it was stopped. A few days ago, some mining experts were sent to mine it, but some technical problems were not solved, and as a result, the coal could not be extracted.
      "Where there are people, there is coal. As long as it meets the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, we must extract it even if there are great difficulties." Xian Bincheng carefully observed the mountain terrain and the direction of the coal seam, and grabbed a handful of black gold from the ground and squeezed it hard: "Yes! Let's decide to work here!"
    Following that, they held a "team meeting" in Chen Tinghai's home. More than ten retired workers listened to the mountain reports of Xia Guotai, Xian Bincheng, and others. Everyone unanimously agreed to build a small coal kiln at No. 4 pit in Dazhulin, but they needed to ask the leaders for a final decision.
    That night, in the office of the mine Party committee, a moving application appeared:
      "We retired old workers of Wangjiaba deeply thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their concern and care for us. Although we are old, we can still move and walk, and we must contribute to the country, produce more coal, and smelt more steel, so that the happy days of communism will come sooner. We request the leaders to agree to our construction of a small coal kiln at No. 4 pit in Dazhulin. We do not want state remuneration, state equipment, or state materials, and we will definitely achieve diligence and thrift, and self-reliance.
          Twelve retired old workers of Wangjiaba April 25th
     Fierce Battle
      Before the "May Day" Labor Day, a dozen retired old workers were enthusiastically discussing the instructions of the mine Party committee to approve the construction of a small coal kiln, which was conveyed by the branch secretary. Although the Party committee told them to pay attention to their health, they still said they would do it right away. They said: We must use new labor to celebrate our festival. "The Party believes in us, we must not fail the Party's expectations." Zhao Huaxuan, an old miner who was sold as a bonded laborer since childhood and suffered all kinds of hardships, felt particularly excited tonight. Before the meeting was over, he left the meeting. The scene at the meeting just now kept flooding his mind, making him unable to calm down. More than a month of rest had made this simple and hardworking old man feel bored. Today, his wish to apply for a coal kiln has finally been realized, how can it not be exciting! Zhao Huaxuan ran home, not even bothering to eat, and took out the pick and axe that he had kept carefully from under the bed, gently wiped off the dust, and said loudly: "This time, you can be used again!"
      On the morning of "May Day," the sky was still full of stars when Zhao Huaxuan got up. He lifted the pick, carried the dirt basket, and hurried towards the construction site. He was confident that "I must be the first to arrive at the construction site today!" As he walked onto the road, he heard the sound of a crisp pick. He was suddenly shocked and couldn't help but speed up his pace. He climbed up a small earth mound and saw that many people had already arrived at the construction site, some were digging, some were shoveling, some were carrying, and laughter and shouts were mixed together. Zhao Huaxuan felt anxious, put down the dirt basket, rolled up his sleeves, and threw himself into the fierce battle.
    When most of the earthwork had been excavated and it looked like they were about to reach the coal seam, due to continuous heavy rain, the loose soil was soaked, and the slope was too steep, resulting in cracks and collapses in many places. Thus, a battle with the heavy rain began. It was not without difficulty for the miners to put up supports on a steep earth wall three or four meters high and seven or eight meters long, and to shovel away the mud soaked by the heavy rain on the loose and slippery slope to stop the cracks and collapses. However, difficulties could not scare the heroes. They faced the wind and rain, those who dug the earth, those who put up supports, those who carried, and those who dragged. Although the roads were muddy and the rain soaked their clothes, they still persevered in the battle with high spirits. Xia Guotai, this Communist Party member who never knew fatigue, became more and more energetic and fought more and more bravely. He simply took off his clothes and ran on the muddy dirt road carrying a dirt basket. In this way, from the early morning to dusk, they finally put up the supports and overcame the difficulties.
    May 8th, this was their most unforgettable day.
    In the early morning, the sun shone with dazzling golden light. After yesterday's fierce battle, people seemed even more courageous. Without waiting for the squad leader to assign tasks, everyone started working. Suddenly, someone shouted:
  "Coal, we have dug up coal!" Everyone swarmed up to watch the shiny black gold, unable to contain the joy in their hearts. Seven or eight days of hard work had finally paid off.
    Production began, and the first cart of black and shiny black gold was pushed out of the kiln door amidst people's laughter and transported to the side of the road.
    As coal production increased day by day, pit props became particularly tight. In order to save pit props and not increase the burden on the country, Zhao Huaxuan proposed to recycle old pit props from the old coal kiln, but he needed a helper. The old worker Du Zhenghan was the first to volunteer to participate.
    Du Zhenghan followed Zhao Huaxuan to the small open-pit old coal kiln. He gently lifted a rock, and a hole more than a foot square appeared, which was pitch black inside. Relying on their decades of coal mining experience and a sincere heart, with the joint efforts of young people, they recovered more than a hundred old pit props from the old kiln.
    The twelve old heroes relied on this drive to overcome all kinds of difficulties. If there were no stakes, they would go to the mountains several kilometers away to cut them down; if there were no bamboo mats, they would collect bamboo and weeds and weave them themselves; if there were no transportation rails, they would use wooden rails instead… They started from scratch with their bare hands and overcame many difficulties that people thought were difficult to overcome.
    Revolution to the End, Forever Forward
    On June 4th, the Nantong Coal Mine Party Committee held a celebration meeting for the old heroes. On this day, the workers of the entire mine beat gongs and drums, sang and danced, and were filled with a festive and joyous atmosphere. Colorful flags, flowers, congratulatory letters, and slogans of various colors made the miners' club look particularly beautiful. The representatives of the workers who participated in the meeting had already crowded into the venue. The twelve old heroes with big red flowers on their chests sat on the rostrum, each with a radiant face and beaming with joy.
    In order to commend their heroic deeds and educate all the workers of the mine, the mine Party committee decided to name the small coal kiln built by the old heroes as
    "Old Hero Well," and awarded them a big red flag with a line of golden characters written on it:
    "Hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the revolution to the end!"
    Amidst warm applause, Xia Guotai, the representative of the old heroes, stood on the rostrum and solemnly swore to the Party:
    "We must teach the young workers the experience and production technology we have accumulated over the decades without reservation…
    "For the happiness of future generations, we must carry the revolution to the end. …
    Recently, the mine Party committee has sent thirteen young people to the Old Hero Mine to learn technology from the old heroes.
    The young workers admire the old heroes very much, and they all said that they will take the heroic deeds of the old heroes as an example for their own learning. Now, under the care of the Party in Chongqing, the twelve old heroes have handed over the cause they created to the young people, and they are living a happier life in their later years.

    老英雄井
    重庆市总工会通讯组
    在我们伟大祖国的每个角落里，到处都可发现奇迹，到处都闪烁着共产主义思想的光辉。
    最近，在南桐煤矿，人们争相传颂着十二位退休老工人的英雄事迹。这十二位老英雄是：夏国太、鲜斌成、赵华轩、陈银三、杜正汉、杨述清、张银洲、尹沛清、赵润清、傅述奎、王启全、汪海云。他们在旧社会长期折磨下，受尽了苦痛的熬煎。解放了，党给了他们新的生命，使他们得到了无比的温暖和幸福。党为了照顾他们的身体健康，今年，又组织他们退休，欢度幸福的晚年。但是，他们一颗要尽快地改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的红心在激烈地跳动，他们闲不住，静不下，只要能动一天，就要为社会主义建设劳动一天。于是，他们赤手空拳，勤俭办矿，没有向国家要一文钱，没有向国家要一件设备，没有向国家要一寸材料，仅仅用了八天的时间，就建成两个小煤窑。一个月来，他们已为国家生产了八百多吨原煤，平均工效高达二点三吨，在全市煤矿职工中，树立了一面光辉的红旗。
    心里不能平静
    3月下旬的一天深夜，七级采煤工鲜斌成在参加退休学习回家的途中，心里很不宁静。他想起二十多年前自己被国民党反动派拉壮丁、强迫来到这个矿上，成天过着吃菜脚根、睡竹篾床的暗无天日的生活；想到今天幸福愉快的晚景；想到祖国建设突飞猛进，煤焦需要愈来愈大的状况；想到全矿的伙伴们为了夺煤保钢，正在彻夜奋战的情景……他越想越爱新社会，越想越觉得自己责任重大。“只要能劳动一天，我就要为社会主义劳动一天”。他打定了主意，要为国家办个小煤窑，增产煤炭。
    当他把自己的打算告诉和他一起参加退休学习的老工人、共产党员夏国太时，夏国太哈哈大笑地说：怎么我们同了心呢，我早就想这样干了，正想多团结些伙伴来干，人多力量大哟！
    4月的一个清晨，南桐煤矿附近的一家茶馆里聚集了一群退休的老工人，人们围着夏国太七嘴八舌地议论办小煤窑的事！
    “退休了光耍硬是不习惯，采煤工人怎能不挖煤？”
    “为了共产主义早日实现，为了子孙后代万年幸福，只能走得，我们就得干……”
    “生产这么紧，看到煤炭的生产跟不上国家的需要，我心里就着急。”平时不大讲话的陈银三像打开了话匣子似的说：“天下无空地，世上无闲人，人要吃饭，钢要煤炼，大家都在大跃进，我看坚决办个土小窑，帮助国家多增加点煤炭……”
    一直未发言的老工人赵华轩，脸上早已激得通红，他像年轻小伙子一样站起来挥了挥拳头说：“干，我们马上就干！”
    一份申请书
    这些日子来，夏国太和鲜斌成、赵华轩、汪海云三个老采煤工，为了选择窑址，翻山越岭，爬过了一个山头又一个山头，查访了一个煤窑又一个煤窑。本来，根据他们二、三十年采煤的丰富经验，采山选窑完全可以很快就能决定的；但事情并不这么简单，为了夺煤保钢，尽快地拿出煤炭，而且，还不要增加国家负担，他们决定了这样几条选窑原则：第一，煤的蕴藏量要多，交通要方便；第二，能吹糠见米，几天就可以出煤；第三，不要国家的设备和材料；第四，要适合老工人的特点，运距短，不上坡下坎。他们选了好些煤井都不完全符合条件。
    当他们来到大竹林时，首先被山头上堆积的几千吨露天煤炭吸引住了。
    “四号眼怎么样？煤不少啊！而且完全符合我们那几条原则。”汪海云激动地说。
    但谁都晓得，四号眼煤窑在1958年大跃进时曾做过，没取出多少煤就停止了。几天前，井上又派了一些采煤能手来开采，由于某些技术上的问题没有解决，结果还是眼看着煤炭拿不出来。
      “有人就有煤，只要符合多快好省的原则，有天大的困难，也要把它采出来。”鲜斌成仔细观察了山势和煤层的方向，从地上抓起一把乌金用力地一捏：“对！就决定在这里干！”
    跟着，他们在陈庭海家中举行了“团堆会”，十多个退休工人听了夏国太、鲜斌成等的采山报告，大家一致同意在四号眼建立小煤窑，但要请示领导作最后决定。
    当天晚上，在矿党委办公室里，出现了一份感人肺腑的申请书：
      “我们王家坝退休老工人，深深感谢党和毛主席对我们的关怀照顾。我们虽然年纪大了，但还能够动得走得，就一定要为国家出力，多产煤，多炼钢，使共产主义的幸福日子早日到来。请求领导同意我们在大竹林四号眼开办小煤窑。我们不要国家报酬，不要国家设备和材料，一定作到勤俭节约，自力更生。
          王家坝十二个退休老工人4月25日
     火热的战斗
      “五一”劳动节前夕，十几个退休老工人，在支部办公室里热烈地议论着支部书记传达矿党委批准开办小煤窑的指示。尽管党委叫他们注意保重身体，他们仍然是说干就干。并说：要用新的劳动来庆祝自己的节日。“党相信我们，一定不要辜负党的期望。”赵华轩这个从小就被卖作包身工、受尽苦难折磨的老矿工，今天晚上感到特别的兴奋。还没等会议开完，他便离开了会场。刚才会上的情景不时地涌上心来，使他怎么也不能平静。一个多月来的休息，早使这个纯朴勤劳的老人闷得发慌。今天，申请办煤窑的愿望终于实现了，怎不令人兴奋呢！赵华轩跑回家里，连饭也顾不上吃，就从床下取出保存得好好的喙子和开山斧，轻轻地拂去上面的灰尘，放声说道：“这回可又用上你了！”
      “五一”的早晨，天上还满挂着星星，赵华轩就起床了。他托起喙子，挑着土箕，急急忙忙地向着工地走去。他满有把握地想：“今天我定是第一个到工地了！”他一走上马路，却听见了一阵清脆的喙子声。他猛地一惊，不由得加快脚步，爬上小土坎一看，工地熙熙攘攘地已来了不少的人，有的在挖，有的在铲，有的在挑，笑声、喊声混成一片。赵华轩心里一急，放下土箕卷起衣袖，就投入了火热的战斗。
    当土方工程挖开了一大半，眼看就要挖到煤层的时候，由于连日暴雨，浸透了疏松的泥土，再加坡度太大，不少的地方出现了裂缝和垮塌。于是，一场与暴雨的搏斗展开了。要在一个三、四米高、七、八米长的陡峭土壁上打上绷子和支撑，要在土松地滑的坡上铲去被暴雨浸透的泥土，以制止裂缝和垮塌，这对矿工们并不是没有困难的。可是，困难吓不倒英雄们，他们一个个迎着风雨，掏土的掏土，打撑的打撑，挑的挑，拖的拖。尽管道路泥泞，雨水湿透衣衫，他们仍然精神抖擞，一直坚持战斗。夏国太这个永远不知疲劳的共产党员，越干越起劲，越战越勇，他干脆脱掉衣服，挑着土箕在泥泞的土路上奔跑。就这样，从清晨激战到黄昏，终于打好了绷子，战胜了困难。
    5月8日，这是他们最难忘的一天。
    清晨，太阳射出耀眼的金光，人们经过昨天的激战，显得更加勇气百倍，不等班长分配任务，大家就干起来了。突然有人大叫起来：
  “煤炭，挖到煤炭了！”大家一涌而上，围看这亮晶晶的乌金，止不住内心的喜悦，七、八天的辛勤劳动，终于获得了成果。
    生产开始了，第一车黑亮亮的乌金，在人们欢笑声中推窑出门，运到了公路边上。
    由于出煤一天天增加，坑木就感到特别紧张，为了节约坑木，不增加国家负担，赵华轩就提出到老煤窑去回收旧坑木，但需要一个帮手，老工人杜正汉第一个报名参加。
    杜正汉跟随着赵华轩来到了小露天老煤窑，轻轻地掀开一块岩石，便出现了尺多见方的一个洞口，里面一片漆黑。他们凭着几十年的采煤经验，一颗赤诚的心，在和年青人的共同努力下，从老窑里回收了百多根旧坑木。
    十二位老英雄就是凭着这股干劲，排除了万难。没有排花，就到数公里外的山上去砍；没有笆片，就采集竹笆、野草自己动手编；没有运输铁轨，就用木轨代替……他们赤手空拳，白手起家，战胜了许多被人们认为是很难克服的困难。
    革命到底永远前进
    6月4日，南桐煤矿党委为老英雄们举行了庆功大会。这天，全矿职工敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞，充满着节日欢乐的气氛。彩旗、鲜花、贺信、各色的标语，把矿工俱乐部打扮得分外美丽，参加大会的职工代表早已拥进会场。十二位胸前戴着大红花的老英雄坐在主席台上，一个个脸上容光焕发，喜笑颜开。
    矿党委为了表彰他们的英雄事迹，教育全矿职工，决定把老英雄们开办的小煤窑命名为
    “老英雄井”，并授予他们一面大红旗，上面写着一行金色大字：
    “高举毛泽东思想红旗，把革命进行到底！”
    在热烈的掌声中，老英雄代表夏国太站在主席台上向党庄严宣誓：
    “一定要把自己几十年来积累的经验和生产技术，毫无保留地教给青年工人……
    “我们为了子孙后代的幸福，一定要把革命进行到底。……
    最近矿党委又派了十三名年青人来到了老英雄矿井，向老英雄们学习技术。
    青年工人对老英雄们很敬佩，他们一致表示，以老英雄的英雄事迹作为自己学习的榜样。现在，十二位老英雄在重庆市党的关怀下，把他们蒂造的事业交给青年人，自己过着更加幸福的晚年生活。（附图片）
