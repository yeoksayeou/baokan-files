Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The mechanical industry in Hebei Province has completed its annual production task of irrigation and drainage machinery ahead of schedule. By the end of June, the province had produced 25,508 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, totaling more than 285,000 horsepower, exceeding the original annual plan by 1.5%. In the first half of the year, the province also produced 29,987 agricultural water pumps, completing 24.5% of the semi-annual plan. These machines were transported to rural areas, providing strong support for the fight against drought.

In the first half of this year, 80.5% of the irrigation and drainage machinery allocated to commercial departments in various regions by the mechanical system were equipped as complete sets. The complete sets of irrigation and drainage machinery transported to the People's Communes through commercial departments amounted to more than 270,000 horsepower.

Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th: Party organizations at all levels in Guangdong Province have taken measures at each level to organize a large-scale movement of industry supporting agriculture. Since the latter half of June, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has convened several important meetings on industry supporting agriculture. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, has repeatedly emphasized that agriculture must be given top priority at present, requiring cadres on the industrial and transportation fronts to take prompt action and regard supporting agriculture as their primary task. The Provincial Party Committee has also put forward specific measures on how industry can further support agriculture, determining that, focusing on the urgent needs of agriculture, the province must vigorously develop chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, power equipment, as well as cement, pesticides and other industries.

Party organizations in various special districts, cities, and counties of Guangdong Province have also recently further strengthened the organizational leadership of industry supporting agriculture. Many factories and mines have also organized work teams to visit communes, understand the needs of agriculture, and jointly formulate plans for supporting agriculture with commune cadres.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Zhejiang agricultural machinery manufacturing departments are doing everything possible to improve product quality, striving to ensure that all kinds of agricultural machinery and tools supporting the early rice harvesting and late rice planting are of high quality and easy to use. At present, the province has manufactured more than 130,000 rice transplanters according to high-quality standards. The 11.13 million new-style farm tools such as large sickles, rapid harvesters, and threshers that have already been manufactured have generally reached high-quality and high-efficiency standards, and have been praised by the broad masses of commune members.

In order to enable agricultural machinery and farm tools to play a greater role in the summer harvest and summer planting, the guarantee slogan put forward by various agricultural machinery factories is: "Quality first, specifications first, unqualified products will not leave the factory." Many factory workers have been working hard on design, drawing the various farm tools and spare parts into drawings to unify specifications. At the same time, each factory has been vigorously developing special production tools for various different products, and each spare part is produced using various jigs and special tools, thereby improving product quality. Many farm tool and machinery factories have also established a strict product quality inspection system to ensure that each farm machine meets specifications.

Our newspaper, Hohhot, 20th: The Inner Mongolia industrial front is vigorously supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production. As of early July, various industrial departments have manufactured more than 11,000 tons of various machines and tools for farmers and herdsmen, 22% more than in the entire previous year. The total number of various new-style machines and small farm tools manufactured has reached more than 7.2 million units (pieces). The vast majority of these machines have been transported to rural and pastoral areas, playing a huge role. At present, more than 500,000 farmers and herdsmen in the region have replaced heavy old-style production tools such as plows, harrows, hoes, and sickles with mechanized and semi-mechanized new-style production machines. This has not only greatly promoted the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, but also saved a large amount of labor in rural and pastoral areas. Calculated by the efficiency of new-style machinery, in the first half of this year, it has increased the equivalent of more than 117 million labor days for agricultural and animal husbandry production.

Xinhua News Agency: While concentrating labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, Beijing is concentrating on producing a batch of agricultural machinery for six agricultural activities that occupy the most labor, such as vegetable planting, wheat planting, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, feed processing, and land leveling, to support agricultural production in the suburbs.

Now, more than 110 municipal, district, county, and commune-run agricultural machinery factories in the city have been urgently mobilized to fully participate in the manufacture of this batch of machinery. There are a total of more than 12,000 various agricultural machines that are being and have been put into production. (Attached picture)

    制造大量新农具支援农业
    据新华社天津讯  河北省机械工业已经提前完成了今年全年的排灌机械制造任务。到6月底为止，全省已生产排灌机械二万五千五百零八台，共二十八万五千多马力，比原订的年计划超额1.5％。上半年全省还生产了农用水泵二万九千九百八十七台，完成了上半年计划的24.5％。这些机械运到农村，有力地支援了抗旱斗争。
    今年上半年机械系统调给各地商业部门的排灌机械，80.5％都配成了套；通过商业部门运到人民公社的成套排灌机械，达二十七万多马力。
    本报广州20日电  广东省各级党组织层层采取措施，组织声势浩大的工业支援农业的运动。广东省委从6月下旬以来，接连召开了几次关于工业支援农业的重要会议，省委第一书记陶铸一再强调指出，当前首先要抓好农业，要求工业交通战线的干部迅速行动起来，把支援农业作为首要任务。省委还对工业如何进一步支援农业提出了具体措施，确定当前围绕农业的迫切需要，全省必须大力发展化学肥料、农业机械、排灌机械、动力设备以及水泥、农药等工业。
    广东省各专区、市、县的党组织，最近也进一步加强了工业支援农业的组织领导。不少厂矿还组织了工作组到公社访问，了解农业的需要，和公社干部共同制定支援农业的规划。
    据新华社杭州讯  浙江农业机械制造部门千方百计提高产品质量，力争使支援早稻抢收和晚稻抢种的各种农机具部部优质，件件好用。目前，全省已按优质标准造好十三万多部插秧机，已经制造好的一千一百一十三万件大镰刀、快速收割器，脱粒机等新式农具，普遍达到优质高工效，受到广大社员的赞扬。
    为了使农业机械和农具在夏收夏种中发挥更大的作用，各农业机械厂提出的保证口号是：“质量第一，规格第一，不合规格不出厂”。许多工厂工人都大搞设计，把各种农具和另件绘成图纸，统一规格。同时，各工厂还针对各种不同产品大搞生产专用工具，每个另件都用各种卡模具和专用工具进行生产，从而提高了产品质量。许多农具机械厂还建立了一套严密的产品质量检验制度，保证台台农机具符合规格。
    本报呼兰浩特20日电  内蒙古工业战线大力支援农牧业生产。截至7月上旬，工业各部门已为农牧民兄弟制造了一万一千多吨的各种机具，比去年全年还多22％。制造出的各种新式机具和小农具共达七百二十多万台（件）。这些机具的绝大部分已运到农村牧区，起了巨大作用。目前，全区已有五十多万农牧民，把多年来的犁耙、锄头、镰刀等笨重的旧式生产工具，换为机械化和半机械化的新式生产机具。这不仅大大促进了农牧业生产的发展，还为农村和牧区节省了大批劳动力。如以新式机具的工效计算，今年上半年，就为农牧业生产增加了相当于一亿一千七百多万个劳动日。
    据新华社讯  北京在集中劳动力增强农业生产第一线的同时，正为占用劳动力最多的种菜、种麦、秋收、秋耕、饲料加工、平整土地等六项农事活动，突击生产一批农业机械，支援郊区农业生产。
    现在全市一百一十多个市属、区属和县、社农业机械工厂，都已紧急动员起来，全力参加这批机械的制造工作。正在和已经投料生产的各种农业机械共有一万二千多台。（附图片）
