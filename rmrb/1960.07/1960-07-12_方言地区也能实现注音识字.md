Phonetic Literacy Can Also Be Achieved in Dialect Areas
Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
In areas with complex dialects, phonetic literacy can not only be achieved but also carried out at high speed.
Fujian is a region with extremely complex dialects. In addition to the three major language families (Fuzhou dialect, Southern Min dialect, Hakka dialect), there are also dozens of others such as Xinghua dialect, Jian'ou dialect, Yong'an dialect, and Longyan dialect. Even within a single county, there are more than a dozen languages that are very different and mutually unintelligible, leading some to feel that "leaving the local area is like going abroad." The level of culture is also very low. Before liberation, the working class were deprived of the right to learn culture, and more than 80% were illiterate. After liberation, the working class turned over politically and economically, and urgently demanded to turn over culturally, and a large-scale mass movement to eliminate illiteracy began. However, during the literacy campaign, some people doubted: can phonetic literacy be promoted in such areas? This doubt seems to make some sense on the surface, but practice has proven that phonetic literacy can not only be promoted in dialect areas, but also achieved quickly, well, economically, and at high speed.

Fujian began phonetic literacy learning in 1956, but at that time the scope was very small and the results were not significant. It was not until 1958, with the advent of the Great Leap Forward, that under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the promotion of Mandarin Chinese and phonetic literacy was vigorously promoted through large-scale mass movements. In a short period of two years, significant achievements have been made. Now more than five million workers, farmers, students, and cadres in the province have participated in phonetic literacy learning, 86% of young adults have been lifted out of illiteracy, more than 2.06 million people have entered spare-time elementary schools, and more than 400,000 people have entered spare-time middle schools and above. All universities, middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens (classes) and various types of spare-time schools use Mandarin Chinese for teaching. Learning Pinyin and Mandarin Chinese has become a social trend in counties such as Jiangle, Chong'an, and Dongshan, which have basically achieved phonetic literacy. Men and women, young and old, cadres and the masses are enthusiastically participating, teaching each other, neighbors teaching each other, couples studying together, three generations under one roof, and moving stories of six-year-old children teaching grandfathers and seventy-year-old grandmothers learning Pinyin have emerged one after another. Farmer writers, poets, and painters are growing day by day. Literary and artistic creation is also surging, and many workers and farmers are writing poetry and autobiographical novels. The sales volume of books and newspapers in rural areas has increased unprecedentedly. The Nankou Xinhua Bookstore in Jiangle County has sold out all the previously accumulated popular reading materials. Young commune member Xiao Xianfa bought eighteen phonetic books such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "Individual and Collective," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" in ten days. With the improvement of cultural level, farmers are also more interested in studying science and technology. Thirteen civilian teachers and students of the Tiemin School in Xiawen Village voluntarily formed a "Michurin Group" and opened three experimental fields, conducting twenty-five research topics on hybridization, grafting, and other scientific and technological experiments. The young people of the brigade all understand the principle of mixed use of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other chemical fertilizers with farm manure and the knowledge of reasonable fertilization. Phonetic literacy has also helped the broad masses of working people open the door to learning theory and has played a huge role in transforming their thinking and raising their awareness. Under the leadership of the party organization, theoretical study groups have been established in many areas. Farmers who have read the phonetic versions of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" believe that "their minds have blossomed and they understand many principles." Tang Wenqi, a vegetable grower in the Nankou Brigade, originally did not have a strong sense of collective and only cared about his own vegetable plot. He was not convinced when others criticized him. After reading the phonetic reading material "Individual and Collective," he felt that his thinking was very shameful, so he made up his mind to take many measures to grow the collective vegetable plot well, which won the praise of all commune members. Chen Tongjin, the production team leader of the Wushan Brigade, was reluctant to be the team leader for fear of difficulties in his work. After reading the phonetic book "Continuous Revolution," he felt that the essence of his thinking was that he did not want to make revolution and had forgotten his roots. So he decided to change and has now become a good team leader. In short, through phonetic literacy, the broad masses of people have removed the hats of illiteracy, expanded their fields of knowledge, broadened their horizons, raised their political awareness, and greatly changed their spiritual outlook. It is really a myriad of sights, talents emerge in large numbers, and the garden is full of flowers and fruits. The past situation of language barriers and cultural backwardness is rapidly changing, and an unprecedented cultural upsurge has begun to take shape.
    
The above achievements have not been achieved smoothly. At the beginning, some people had a resistant attitude towards promoting phonetic literacy, believing that teaching in Mandarin Chinese would affect the speed of literacy and would not work, advocating teaching in dialects; conservatives also believed that learning Pinyin and Mandarin Chinese was "forgetting one's roots"; some difficulties appeared among the masses, such as saying: "Pinyin is a foreign thing, it is difficult to learn!" "Learn to fly before you learn to walk!"; women even thought: "I don't go out, and I don't become a cadre, what's the use of phonetic literacy", and even some cadres and party members believed: "Production is busy, culture is put aside, I am illiterate, Pinyin is not my thing", "Promoting phonetic literacy is a matter for the next generation".

We conducted patient persuasion and education on the incorrect understanding of the masses. The generation of these incorrect understandings is often due to insufficient understanding of the objective situation or misunderstandings about phonetic literacy. They do not understand that the high-speed promotion of phonetic literacy is not simply out of people's subjective wishes, but is promoted by the objective situation and is in line with the development needs of socialist revolution and construction. Language is a tool for expressing thoughts and feelings and exchanging experiences. Due to cultural backwardness and complex languages in Fujian, we have encountered many difficulties in our work, production, and learning. In the early days of liberation, cadres who went to Wushan Township in Datian County to work had to ask a landlord to be a translator because they could not speak the language. As a result, the landlord took the opportunity to distort the party's policies and turn good into bad and bad into good, causing losses to the work. Some people, due to inaccurate pronunciation, turn politics into economics, forty into fourteen, and even call the teacher a mouse, which caused some mistakes and misunderstandings that could have been avoided. This situation has also brought many troubles to the lives of the masses. A farmer in Putian County wanted to take a car to Jiangkou, which was only 20 kilometers away from his home, but because he could not speak the language and was illiterate, he traveled more than 100 kilometers and ran to Guankou in Tongan County. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people's communes were realized throughout the province, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the relations between working people have become closer. This requires more extensive mutual cooperation and exchange of experience between regions and between the masses in order to improve together and leap forward side by side. However, backward culture, complex languages and this situation are not only incompatible, but also form sharp contradictions, just as the broad masses of working people feel: "If you can't speak the language, you can't move an inch," "Communism is heaven, but you can't reach it without culture." The general trend of socialist construction and the strong desire of the broad masses of working people have converged into an irresistible cultural torrent, surging forward, just as Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific prediction said: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction is bound to appear." This is the objective basis for us to must and can achieve phonetic literacy at high speed. If cultural backwardness and complex dialects can be a reason and excuse for the difficulty in achieving phonetic literacy, it is better to say that this situation is precisely the reason and condition for the need to achieve phonetic literacy at high speed.

　  To Carry Out Phonetic Literacy, We Must Follow the Mass Line and Launch a Large-Scale Mass Movement
We are so convinced that phonetic literacy can be achieved at high speed in dialect areas because under the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have learned a whole set of mass line work methods, which is a priceless treasure that applies to all parts of the world. Phonetic literacy is not something mysterious. Like other revolutionary construction work, as long as we can firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and boldly mobilize the masses to launch a large-scale mass movement, we will be invincible and achieve remarkable results, and any difficulties will be solved. Conversely, if we do not follow the mass line and only rely on a few experts, we will inevitably be deserted, full of difficulties, and accomplish nothing. Even if there are some achievements, they are insignificant.
    
When it comes to promoting phonetic literacy, many people think of the issue of teachers, which is an important issue and should be given great attention. However, the solution to the teacher problem must still rely on the masses. Before July 1958, the Wushan Brigade in Datian County did not have a single teacher who knew Pinyin. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, they used the mass line of "civilians teaching civilians" and "those who are capable are teachers", relying on Chen Jinshi (a national youth socialist construction activist), an ordinary working person who learned phonetic notation at the National First Mandarin Teaching Achievement Observation Meeting. They opened a phonetic literacy training class of more than 50 people, which quickly launched the phonetic literacy movement. Not only did they completely solve the problem of teachers, but the entire brigade also realized phonetic literacy before the tenth anniversary of National Day. Later, they realized spare-time primary school and started spare-time junior high school. Now they have even greater ambitions: they decided to popularize spare-time junior high school before this year's National Day and realize spare-time high school in 1962. This shows that a single spark can start a prairie fire, and the wisdom of the masses is as vast as the sea and the sky.
    
To mobilize the masses to promote phonetic literacy, it is necessary to explain the benefits of phonetic literacy to the masses. Because the masses are the smartest and most reasonable, as long as the leaders explain the truth clearly and thoroughly, the masses will not only resolutely implement it, but also draw inferences from one instance and make up for the shortcomings of the leaders. Realizing phonetic literacy can promote the building of socialism quickly, well, and economically. Just as Xie Yudi, a nineteen-year-old female commune member who had just escaped illiteracy, wrote in her poem: "Everyone says that gold bracelets are treasures, but I say that letters are better. Gold bracelets can only be used as decorations, but Pinyin helps me sweep away illiteracy. I can read books and newspapers, and political skills are quickly improved. Workers and peasants climb the peaks of science, and socialism will be built soon." They also summarized the benefits of phonetic literacy into six points: the first is speed. According to the experience of this brigade: young people generally only need about 15 hours, and adults only need about 20 hours to master the pronunciation and spelling of initials and finals; the second is review. Phonetic literacy is a powerful weapon to eliminate the return to illiteracy; the third is convenience. As long as you learn Pinyin, you can spell and recognize yourself, learn without a teacher, and learn anytime, anywhere; the fourth is to use it. Through phonetic tools, you can self-study phonetic political theory, science and technology reading materials, and improve your political awareness and scientific and technological level; the fifth is to improve. Phonetic literacy can not only eliminate illiteracy, but also quickly popularize spare-time primary schools and improve reading and writing skills; the sixth is to promote. Phonetic literacy can correct pronunciation and promote Mandarin Chinese, which is more effective than directly learning Mandarin Chinese by listening and speaking.

  To mobilize the masses to enthusiastically participate in phonetic literacy, special attention should be paid to closely combining production and life, and widely carrying out social mobilization work to create a social atmosphere where the eyes are full of letters, there are phonetic sounds everywhere, everyone learns to read, and everyone writes poems. Jiangle County adopted the method of six items to the fields (farm tools, blackboards, chalk, Pinyin textbooks, Pinyin cards, Pinyin poker), which can both entertain and play games, but also learn Pinyin, and can also be combined with propaganda and mobilization work. Some communes also publish phonetic poems and phonetic wall newspapers, use radio to learn Pinyin, teach Pinyin before showing movies, and use phonetic notations on road signs, signboards, slogans, and posters. The walls are full of poems, and the learning atmosphere is extremely enthusiastic. The commune members proudly described their learning situation: "The party's leadership is so wise, the mountain gully has become a cultural village, schools are established in the east village and the west village, and the sound of reading is heard in front of and behind the village. Everyone has a pen hanging on their chest, and everyone can fight and write. The whole people are learning Mandarin Chinese, and advanced deeds are on the red flag."

   We are so convinced that phonetic literacy can be achieved at high speed in dialect areas. In addition to mastering the mass line, a weapon that applies to all parts of the world, we have also explored a set of specific methods for achieving phonetic literacy at high speed.

  　Phonetic Literacy, Learning Culture, and Promoting Mandarin Chinese are Combined to Implement Phonetic Literacy Quickly, Well, and Economically.
    Our experience has proven that as long as we closely combine phonetic literacy, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and learning culture (including literacy and spare-time education), complementing each other and promoting each other, we can achieve phonetic literacy quickly, well, and economically. Pinyin letters are a tool for literacy and also a tool for promoting Mandarin Chinese. In fact, in areas with complex dialects, it is impossible to combine phonetic notation, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and learning culture, because without combining phonetic literacy to learn Mandarin Chinese, and without being familiar with and mastering the tool of Pinyin letters, written language and spoken language cannot progress and be used uniformly at the same time; and promoting Mandarin Chinese in isolation, without combining learning Pinyin to read and write, can only be learned and spoken by rote, which will not be learned well or quickly; simply reading and writing, teaching in dialects, without combining learning Pinyin, the result is that although illiteracy is eliminated, the language cannot communicate. Conversely, if phonetic literacy, learning Mandarin Chinese, and improving culture, the result can be twice the result with half the effort and three things can be accomplished at one stroke. This method is actually a concrete manifestation of the spirit of the general line in cultural education. Before Fujian Province adopted this three-combination method, although it had achieved many achievements in literacy and popularizing primary education, it was still not very compatible with the high-speed development of other socialist construction undertakings. Since exploring the experience of three combinations, the cultural outlook has been completely renewed. This is because there is a general line as the soul in the three combinations, which is in line with dialectics.

    The general method of the three combinations is: the first step is to focus on intensive Pinyin letters, supplemented by reading and writing to learn Mandarin Chinese. According to the situation in Datian, Qingning and other places, workers and peasants generally use 20 to 30 hours to learn Pinyin letters to the extent that they can recognize, write, spell, and use them. The second step is to focus on reading and writing, supplemented by consolidating Pinyin, and gradually mastering the tool of Pinyin letters skillfully. The third step is to read and write a lot, improve writing skills, and combine correcting pronunciation and learning accurate Mandarin Chinese. The three-combination method has a very significant effect, accelerating the speed of literacy, consolidating and expanding the results of literacy, and rapidly improving the writing ability of the masses. In the past, Nankou Women's Team in Jiangle County only needed to attend night school for three months to recognize 1,500 characters to reach the level of graduation from literacy. Commune member Chen Guiying originally did not know a single character, but she removed her hat of illiteracy in less than three months after entering night school. In the past, 90% of the young adults in the brigade had eliminated illiteracy, but at the end of last year's inspection, 15% had completely returned to illiteracy and 30% had partially returned to illiteracy. After learning Pinyin, the return-to-literacy rate rapidly increased to 98% and all of them were promoted to the senior primary school class. Therefore, the masses composed folk songs praising: "Phonetic literacy is a treasure, you can remember the words you have learned, if you forget the words, look at the phonetic notation, no matter how many words there are, you can't be overwhelmed." The three-combination method is also very helpful for improving the quality of Mandarin Chinese. The pronunciation of many dialects in our province is very different from the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese. In the past, although some people could speak Mandarin Chinese, their pronunciation was inaccurate and people from other places could not understand it. Wushan Brigade in Datian County is a red flag for promoting Mandarin Chinese throughout the country, but before adopting the three-combination, many commune members still did not speak Mandarin Chinese well because they learned, memorized, and spoke by rote. After combining with learning Pinyin, they surprisingly became people with Beijing accents. The role of the three-combination in improving the reading and writing level of workers and peasants is even more significant. Before learning Pinyin, many workers and peasants often could not read or interrupted their train of thought in reading and writing because there were stumbling blocks, causing great difficulties in reading and writing. After learning Pinyin, they could spell out words or look up Pinyin dictionaries, or use Pinyin to replace stumbling blocks and smoothly read on. Therefore, the masses said: "Pinyin letters are a treasure, you can read books and newspapers without a teacher, study hard and practice diligently, and greatly improve your political, cultural, and technical skills.

　   To Promote Phonetic Literacy, We Must Strengthen Party Leadership and Adhere to Putting Politics in Command.
    Promoting phonetic literacy is a political task, so whether phonetic literacy can be achieved in dialect areas is not simply a matter of writing reform methods and techniques, but also a matter of political ideology. Therefore, in the movement to promote phonetic literacy, we must attach importance to strengthening the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and fight against all viewpoints, remarks, and practices that violate the spirit of the general line. The Provincial Party Committee has always grasped this issue tightly. It has given clear instructions on the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese and promoting phonetic literacy, and has established a special organization to be responsible for this work, continuously unifying arrangements, unifying deployments, grasping production and also grasping learning. Especially since the Party Central Committee issued instructions to quickly promote the experience of Wanrong County, the Provincial Party Committee and Party organizations at all levels have paid more attention to this issue. We believe that with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the advanced experience of fraternal regions as a mirror, and with our own practical experience, as long as the whole Party and the whole people work together, the phonetic literacy work in our province will definitely be able to move forward more widely, more deeply, more effectively, and more quickly, and achieve greater and better results like other socialist construction undertakings.

　　方言地区也能实现注音识字
　　中共福建省委书记处书记　林一心
　  方言复杂地区，不仅可以实现注音识字而且可以高速度进行
    福建是一个方言极为复杂的地区，除三大语系（福州话、闽南话、客家话）外，还有兴化话、建瓯话、永安话、龙岩话等几十种，甚至一个县内就有十多种差异很大、互不相通的语言，以致有人感到“离开本地，好比出国”。文化水平也很低，解放前，工农群众被剥夺了学文化的权利，有80％以上是文盲。解放后，工农群众在政治上、经济上翻了身，迫切要求在文化上翻身，大规模的群众性的扫除文盲运动开始了。但是，在扫盲运动过程中曾经有人怀疑：在这样地区能否推行注音识字？这种怀疑表面看来好像是有些道理，但实践证明：在方言地区不仅能够推行注音识字，而且完全可以多快好省高速度地实现注音识字。
    福建开展注音识字学习始于1956年，但那时范围很小，收效也不大，直到1958年随着大跃进形势的到来，在省委的领导下，通过大搞群众运动，大力推广普通话和注音识字。在短短的两年时间内，已取得显著的成绩，现在全省已有五百多万工人、农民、学生、干部参加注音识字学习，有86％的青壮年已经脱盲，进业余高小学校的有二百零六万多人，进业余中学以上学校的有四十多万人。所有大、中、小学、幼儿园（班）以及各级各类业余学校都采用普通话教学。将乐、崇安、东山等县已基本实现了注音识字化。许多地区学拼音、学普通话已成社会风气，男女老少、干部群众都踊跃参加，亲教亲、邻教邻、夫妻同学，三代同堂，六岁幼儿教祖父，七旬婆婆学拼音的动人佳话纷纷出现。农民作家、诗人、画家日益成长。文艺创作也风起云涌，许多工农群众大写诗歌和自传小说。农村中书报的销售量空前增加，将乐县的南口新华书店将过去积压的大批通俗读物全部销完，青年社员萧先发一个人在十天中就买了“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“个人与集体”、“愚公移山”等十八册注音书籍。随着文化水平的提高，农民对研究科学、技术也更感兴趣。下温村铁民校十三个民师和学员，自动组成“米丘林小组”，开辟了三块试验场地，先后进行了二十五个关于杂交、嫁接等科技试验题目的研究。该大队青年都懂得氮磷钾等化肥与农家肥的混合使用原理及合理施肥的知识。注音识字还帮助广大劳动人民打开了学习理论的大门，并起到改造思想提高觉悟的巨大作用。许多地区在党组织的领导下，成立了理论学习小组，农民们读了注音的“矛盾论”、“实践论”，都认为“思想上开了花，懂得了许多道理”。南口大队种菜员汤文其原来集体观念不强，只关心个人菜地，别人批评他还不服气，在读了“个人与集体”注音读物后，感到自己的思想很可耻，便下定决心，采取许多措施，将集体菜地种好，获得全体社员的赞扬；吴山大队生产队长陈通进，因怕工作困难，曾一度不愿当队长，在读了注音的“不断革命”一书后，觉得自己的思想实质是不想革命，是忘本，于是决心转变，现已成为一个好队长。总之，广大群众通过注音识字，摘掉了文盲帽子，扩展了知识领域，眼界开朗了，政治觉悟提高了，精神面貌大大改变了。真是气象万千，人才辈出，花果满园，美不胜收，过去那种语言不通，文化落后的状况，正在迅速改观，一个史无前例的文化高潮已经开始形成。
    取得以上成绩，并不是一帆风顺的。开始时，有的人对推行注音识字有抵触情绪，认为用普通话教学会影响扫盲速度，行不通，主张用方言教学；有保守思想的人还认为学拼音、学普通话是“忘本”；在群众中出现过一些畏难情绪，如说：“拼音是洋昆，难学！”“未学行，先学飞！”；妇女更认为：“一不出门，二不当干部，注音识字有啥用”，甚至在少数干部党员中也有人认为：“生产忙又忙，文化放一旁，自己是文盲，拼音不在行”、“推广注音识字是下一代的事情”。
    我们对于群众中不正确的认识，进行了耐心说服教育。产生这些不正确的认识，往往是由于对客观形势认识不足或对注音识字存在误解。他们不理解高速推行注音识字，并非单纯出于人们的主观愿望，而是客观形势促成的，是合乎社会主义革命和建设发展需要的。语言文字是表达思想感情和交流经验的一种工具，福建由于文化落后，语言复杂，曾使我们在工作、生产和学习中增加了许多困难。解放初期，大田县到吴山乡工作的干部，因为语言不通，不得不叫一个地主当翻译，结果那个地主乘机歪曲党的方针、政策，把好说成坏，把坏说成好，使工作遭受损失。有的由于语音不准确，把政治说成经济，把四十说成十四，甚至把老师叫做老鼠，这就造成一些本来可以避免的差错和误会。这种情况也给群众生活带来了许多苦恼。莆田县有个农民要搭汽车到离家仅二十公里的江口去，但因语言不通，又不识字，结果多搭了一百多公里，跑到同安县的灌口。特别自1958年大跃进后，全省实现了人民公社化，生产关系起了根本变化，劳动人民之间的关系更加密切，这都要求地区之间和群众之间必须进行更广泛的互相协作，交流经验，以便共同提高，并肩跃进。而落后的文化、复杂的语言和这种形势不仅不相称，而且形成尖锐矛盾，正如广大劳动群众所感到的那样：“语言不通，寸步难行”、“共产主义是天堂，没有文化登不上。”社会主义建设的大势所趋和广大劳动群众的强烈愿望，汇成了一股不可阻遏的文化洪流，汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前，正如毛泽东同志的科学预见那样：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”这就是我们必须和能够高速实现注音识字的客观依据。如果说文化落后、方言复杂，可以成为难于实现注音识字的理由和借口，倒不如说这种情况恰恰是需要高速实现注音识字的原因和条件。
　  开展注音识字必须走群众路线大搞群众运动
    我们所以坚信在方言地区能够高速实现注音识字，是因为在党中央和毛主席的教导下，我们学会了一整套群众路线的工作方法，这个方法是放之四海而皆准的无价之宝。注音识字并不是什么神秘的事情，它也和其他革命建设工作一样，只要能坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，就一定能够所向披靡，成绩卓著，任何困难都会迎刃而解，反之，如果不走群众路线，只依靠少数专家，就必然冷冷清清，困难重重，一事无成，即使有点成绩，也是微不足道。
    一提起推广注音识字，许多人就会想到师资问题，这虽然是个重要问题，应该十分重视。但师资问题的解决，仍然必须依靠群众，大田县吴山大队在1958年7月以前全大队没有一个会拼音的教师，但他们在党支部领导下运用了“以民教民”、“能者为师”的群众路线，依靠在全国第一次普通话教学成绩观摩会上学会注音的陈进四（全国青年社会主义建设积极分子）这样一个普通的劳动人民，开办了五十多人的注音识字训练班，就把注音识字运动迅速开展起来，不仅完全解决了师资问题，而且全大队还在国庆十周年前夕实现了注音识字化，以后又实现了业余高小化和办起业余初中，现在他们更抱着雄心大志：决定今年国庆前普及业余初中，1962年实现业余高中化。这说明了星星之火可以燎原，群众智慧如海如天。
    要发动群众推行注音识字，就要向群众说清注音识字的好处。因为群众是最聪明最讲道理的，只要领导上把道理说清讲透，群众不但能坚决贯彻，而且举一反三，弥补领导之不足。实现注音识字能够促进多快好省地建设社会主义。正如刚刚脱盲的十九岁的女社员谢玉娣写的诗歌那样：“人人都说金镯宝，我说不如字母好，金镯只能当饰品，拼音帮我把盲扫。能看书来能看报，政治技术快提高。工农攀上科学峰，社会主义早建好。”他们还把注音识字的好处归纳成六点：第一是高速，据这个大队的经验：一般的青年只要十五小时左右，壮年只要二十小时左右就能掌握声母、韵母的发音和拼音；第二是回熟，注音识字是消灭回生的有力武器；第三是便利，只要学了拼音，就可以自拼自认，无师自通，随时随地能够学习；第四是致用，通过注音工具，自学注音的政治理论、科学技术读物，提高政治觉悟，提高科学技术水平；第五是提高，注音识字不仅能扫盲，而且能迅速地普及业余高小，提高阅读和写作能力；第六是推广，注音识字可以校正读音，推广普通话，比耳听口传直接学普通话的效果好。
  要发动群众推行注音识字，还须要抓住基本阵地，业余学校和普通学校是青壮年和少年儿童集中的场所，不仅能够有效地推行注音识字和培训师资，而且还可动员青壮年和少年儿童当辅导员和小先生，通过他们又能动员更多的人参加学习注音识字和推广普通话。厦门大学中文系一年级学生，到厦门玻璃厂帮助开展注音识字运动，他们办了一个注音扫盲试点班，使几十个参加学习的职工在两周内脱盲，认识一千字左右，并且得到巩固。
    要发动群众热烈参加注音识字，特别要注意紧密结合生产、生活，广泛地进行社会发动工作，造成满目皆字母，到处拼音声，人人学识字，个个写诗文的社会风气。将乐县采取六到田（农具、黑板、粉笔、拼音课本、拼音卡片、拼音扑克到田）的办法，既可娱乐、游戏，又能学习拼音，而且还可结合进行宣传鼓动工作。有的公社还出版注音诗歌、注音墙头报，利用广播学拼音，放电影前教拼音，路标、招牌、标语口号上也注音，诗歌满墙，学习气氛极为热烈。社员们这样自豪地描写他们的学习盛况：“党的领导真英明，山沟变成文化村，东庄西庄办学校，村前村后皆书声。人人胸前挂钢笔，个个能武又能文。全民都学普通话，先进事迹红旗登。”
    我们之所以坚信方言地区能够高速度实现注音识字，除掌握群众路线这个放之四海而皆准的武器以外，还摸索到一套高速实现注音识字的具体作法。
  　注音识字、学文化、推广普通话三结合，多快好省实行注音识字
    我们的经验证明：只要很好地把注音识字、推广普通话、学文化（包括扫盲、业余教育）三者紧密结合起来，相辅相成，互相促进，就能够多快好省地实现注音识字。拼音字母是识字的工具，也是推广普通话的工具。事实上在方言复杂地区，不把注音、推广普通话、学文化三者结合起来是行不通的，因为不结合注音识字学普通话，不熟悉掌握拼音字母这个工具，文字和语言就不能同时进步，统一使用；而孤立地推广普通话，不结合学习拼音识字，只能硬学硬讲，就会学得不好不快；单纯识字，用方言教学，不结合学习拼音，结果虽然扫盲了，语言还不能沟通。反之，如果注音识字、学普通话，又提高了文化，就可以事半功倍，一举三得。这个作法，实际上是总路线精神在文化教育中的具体体现。福建省在采用这种三结合方法以前，虽然在扫盲和普及初等教育中取得不少成绩，但和其他社会主义建设事业的高速度发展比较起来还是不很相称。自摸索出三结合的经验以后，文化面貌已焕然一新。这是因为三结合中有总路线作灵魂，是符合辩证法的。
    三结合的一般作法是：第一步，以突击拼音字母为主，识字学普通话为辅，根据大田、清宁等地情况，工农群众学拼音字母一般用二十至三十小时就能达到会认、会写、会拼、会用的程度。第二步，以识字为主，巩固拼音为辅，逐步作到熟练地掌握拼音字母这个工具。第三步，大量阅读、写作，提高写作能力并结合正音、学准普通话。三结合的作法效果很显著，加快了扫盲速度，巩固和扩大了扫盲成果，迅速提高了群众的写作能力。将乐县南口娣队过去扫盲只要上三个月的夜校就能识一千五百字，达到扫盲毕业程度。社员陈桂英原来一字不识，进了夜校不到三个月就摘掉文盲帽子。这个大队青壮年原已有90％扫除了文盲，但在去年底检查，全部回生的有15％，一部分回生的有30％。经过学拼音，回熟率迅速上升98％，并全部升入高小班。所以群众编山歌赞道：“注音识字是个宝，学过的生字能记牢，忘了生字看注音，生字再多难不倒。”三结合的作法对提高普通话的质量也很有帮助，我省许多方言的语音和普通话的语音差别甚大，过去有的人虽然会讲普通话，但是发音不准，外地人听不懂。大田县吴山大队是全国推广普通话的一面红旗，但在采用三结合以前，许多社员由于硬学硬记硬讲，所以普通话仍讲得不好，结合学拼音后，居然变成人人北京腔了。三结合对提高工农群众阅读、写作水平的作用就更为显著，学拼音前，许多工农群众在阅读和写作中因为有拦路虎和绊脚石，往往看不下去或打断思路，造成阅读和写作上的很大困难，学拼音后，就可拼音识字或查拼音字典，或用拼音顶替拦路虎和绊脚石，顺利地读下去，所以群众说：“注音字母是个宝，无师自通看书报，勤学苦练多钻研，政治文化技术大提高。
　   推行注音识字必须加强党的领导坚持政治挂帅
    推行注音识字，是个政治任务，所以方言地区能否实现注音识字，并不单纯是个文字改革方法和技术问题，而且是一个政治思想问题。因此，在推行注音识字运动中，必须重视加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，和一切违反总路线精神的观点、言论和作法作斗争，省委对这个问题，一向是抓得紧的。对推广普通话和推行注音识字工作都作过明确指示，并成立专门机构负责这项工作，不断地统一安排、统一部署，抓生产的同时也抓学习，特别自党中央发布迅速推广万荣县经验的指示后，省委及各级党组织更重视这一问题。我们相信，有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有兄弟地区先进经验作借镜，加上自己的实践经验，只要全党全民共同努力，我省注音识字工作一定能够更广泛更深入更有效更迅速地向前推进，和其他社会主义建设事业一样，取得更大更好的成绩。
