　　Full of Confidence, Keep Moving Forward!
　　A Postscript to the July 2nd Tokyo Demonstration
　　Lan Hai
　　"Blood cannot be shed in vain, we must uphold justice, defeat the national enemy, defeat the running dogs who sell out the motherland..." This was the impassioned song of the National Independence Action Team broadcast from a loudspeaker truck during the major demonstration held in Tokyo on July 2nd. At 3:30 p.m. on July 2nd, the marching crowds passed in front of the reception area for members of the House of Representatives. At the head of the procession was a thousand-strong contingent from the Gunma Prefecture Senior High School Teachers and Staff Union. They marched in rows of sixteen, led by more than ten red flags, their steps strong and resolute. Following them were the "All Justice" Workers' Union, the "All Agriculture and Forestry" Workers' Union, the "All Commerce and Industry" Workers' Union and other national public service workers' unions. Next came a contingent of universities, research institutes, and research groups, headed by a professor from Hosei University. The weather in Tokyo these past few days had been unbearably hot, especially on this day because it had just rained, making it even more stifling, like a steamer. However, the demonstrators paid no attention to the heat; disregarding their sweat-soaked clothes, they marched valiantly through the scorching Tokyo streets, shouting slogans such as "Do not recognize the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'" and "The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet step down!" The sound of the slogans made the windows of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's official residence tremble. The plane trees lining the roads, which had lost their vigor in the sweltering heat, regained their vitality under the dense forest of red flags. Everywhere the demonstration went, spirits were high, filled with the fiery atmosphere of struggle.
　　On July 2nd, national rallies were held simultaneously in more than fifty major cities across Japan, demanding non-recognition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the immediate dissolution of the Diet, the smashing of reactionary suppression, and the removal of the masterminds who promoted the "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty" from the political arena. A total of two million people participated in the rallies across the country. The struggle to prevent the emergence of a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet, subservient to the United States and suppressing the people, to win the dissolution of the Diet by a democratic caretaker cabinet, and to enable democratic forces to win in the general election, had spread to all parts of the country in the twentieth unified action. However, since Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his resignation on June 23rd, the Kishi Nobusuke faction, under the protection of U.S. imperialism, continued to struggle desperately, attempting to create another Kishi Nobusuke-style traitorous and reactionary government that would submit to the United States and suppress the people. The Japanese people saw through this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and the large-scale demonstrations and national rallies they held on July 2nd were a new step in smashing this conspiracy and fighting to abolish the new "Security Treaty." Not only in Tokyo, but also in Osaka, Kobe, and other places, the firm will of the Japanese people was fully demonstrated.
　　The central national rally held in Tokyo on July 2nd was held in two sessions, day and night, at Miyakezaka, near the Diet building, where the National Theatre is planned to be built. The daytime rally was attended by 100,000 people, mainly members of the National Public Service Workers' Union and the Local Public Service Workers' Union. The night rally was attended by 50,000 people, mainly members of private enterprise unions and members of various democratic groups. A very exciting feature of this demonstration was the spontaneous participation of unorganized ordinary citizens of Tokyo in the large-scale demonstration. Their contingents advanced from three locations: Yaesu Exit of Tokyo Station, Shinjuku Station, and Shibuya Station, and joined the demonstration of the national rally. They held huge banners with the striking words "We are the 'Voice of the Voiceless Citizens'." Didn't Kishi Nobusuke once deceive himself by saying that "the voice of the silent people supports me"? These "voices of the silent people" felt very indignant about Kishi Nobusuke's lies. Their participation in the demonstration was a concrete action to demonstrate and protest against Kishi Nobusuke. Among those participating in the demonstration of ordinary citizens was a housewife leading two children, who said: "I want to participate in a demonstration at least once, to let Kishi Nobusuke and his ilk hear the 'voice of the silent people'. So today I was determined to participate in this demonstration. As a mother, I absolutely do not recognize the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'!"
　　At the daytime national rally, Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, and actor Osamu Takizawa all gave speeches. Takizawa Osamu spoke on behalf of the "Security Treaty" Criticism Association of the cultural circles. He said: "Artists must not detach themselves from the struggle of the masses and bury themselves in art. We are now actively participating in the struggle for democracy, peace, and independence. This struggle is a historical drama greater than any masterpiece we have ever performed. We are proud and grateful to be able to play a loyal role in the entire performance of this people's historical drama." The audience responded to Takizawa Osamu's speech with thunderous applause.
　　Chairman Sanzo Nosaka of the Japanese Communist Party first emphasized in his speech that the Japanese people had already achieved certain victories. He said: "The strength of the Japanese people forced Eisenhower to cancel his visit to Japan, disrupting his plan to piece together a Northeast Asian treaty group. And we have already pushed Kishi Nobusuke halfway into his coffin." He also said: "But Kishi Nobusuke is sticking his head out of the coffin and still plotting new conspiracies." Chairman Nosaka sharply criticized the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke faction to form a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet to suppress the people and to "bring into effect" the new "Security Treaty" which should be turned into waste paper. He called for the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of a general election by a democratic caretaker cabinet, and for this purpose, it is necessary to expand and strengthen the united action centered on the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Finally, he said: "We do not yet have the strength to carry out a revolution. However, the people have clearly shown that they possess the power to push politics forward. In the past, the fate of Japan was in the hands of the ruling class, but now the fate of Japan is in the hands of the people. We must continue the struggle with full confidence."
　　The central national rally, held in two sessions, day and night, while adopting the "National Declaration," also announced the crimes of more than a dozen reactionary politicians, including Kishi Nobusuke, who planned the dirty dealings of "ratifying" the new "Security Treaty," and resolutely demanded that they be removed from the political arena.
　　After noon, the cloudy sky began to dissipate, and by evening it was a clear blue sky. The people who attended the night rally, inspired by the speeches of the representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party in front of the Diet, shouted slogans against suppression in front of the Metropolitan Police Department, and advanced through Ginza Avenue, the most prosperous street in Tokyo. At the front of the demonstration was a large contingent of 15,000 people from Kanagawa Prefecture, who lined up in rows of sixteen, holding hands and crowding the thirty-meter-wide road. Pedestrians along the road applauded and welcomed them, showering the marchers with homemade confetti. When the demonstration passed through Ginza Avenue, illuminated by neon lights as bright as day, the brilliance of the red flags of the demonstration far surpassed the neon lights, giving a strong impression. This is a symbol of the power to open up the future of Japan. (Attached picture)

　　满怀信心，继续前进！
　　追记七月二日东京大示威
　　蓝海
      “鲜血不能白流，我们要伸张正义，打垮民族敌人，打垮出卖祖国的走狗……”这是7月2日在东京举行的大示威中，从宣传车里发出的高吭的民族独立行动队的歌声。7月2日下午三时半，示威游行的群众队伍走过众议院议员接见处的前面。走在前头的是群马县高级中学教职员工会的一千人的队伍。他们排成十六人一行，以十多面红旗为先导，迈着矫健的步伐前进。接着是“全司法”职员工会、“全农林”工会、
  “全商工”工会等国家公务员工会的队伍。再就是以法政大学教授为首的各大学、研究所和研究团体的队伍。这几天来东京的天气酷热难当，尤其是这一天因为刚刚落过一阵小雨，更加闷热得有如蒸笼一般。但是，示威游行的队伍根本没有把酷热放在心上，他们不顾汗流浃背以激昂的声调高呼“不承认新日美‘安全条约’”“岸信介内阁下台”的口号，雄赳赳地在炎夏的东京街头行进。口号声把岸信介首相官邸的窗户震得发抖。在盛暑中失去生气的马路两旁的公孙树，在密林般的红旗辉映下恢复了生气。示威游行队伍所到之处，群情振奋，充满了斗争的火热气氛。
    7月2日这一天，在日本全国主要城市的五十余处同时举行了不承认新日美“安全条约”、立即解散国会、粉碎反动派镇压以及从政界中清除促进“批准”新“安全条约”的首谋者的国民大会。各地参加大会的总计达二百万人。为阻止岸信介式内阁出现、争取由民主的看守内阁解散国会并使民主力量在大选中获胜而进行的斗争，在第二十次统一行动中已经扩及全国各地。但是，自从6月23日岸信介被迫宣布下台以来，岸信介一派人在美帝国主义庇护下，仍然垂死挣扎，妄图制造另一个屈从美国和镇压人民的岸信介式卖国反动政府。日本人民识破了美日反动派的这一阴谋，他们在7月2日举行的大示威和国民大会，就是在粉碎这一阴谋和争取废除新“安全条约”斗争中迈出的新的一步。不仅在东京，在大阪、神户及其他地方都充分地显示了日本人民的这一坚强斗志。
    7月2日在东京举行的中央国民大会，是在国会议事堂附近的三宅坂预定修建国立剧场的地方分作昼夜两次召开的。参加白天大会的有以国家公务员工会、地方公务员工会会员为主的十万群众。参加夜间大会的有以私营企业工会会员、各民主团体成员为主的五万群众。这次示威游行的一个非常令人兴奋的特点，就是东京的没有组织的一般市民自动参加了大示威。他们的队伍从东京车站八重州口、新宿车站、涩谷车站等三个地方前进，同国民大会的游行队伍会合。他们高举巨幅标语牌，上面写着“我们是‘没有声音的声音的市民’”几个醒目的大字。岸信介不是曾经自欺欺人地说过“无声人民的声音在支持我”吗？这些
  “无声人民的声音”的一般市民对于岸信介的谎言感到十分愤慨。他们参加游行就是用具体行动向岸信介示威和抗议。在参加这次一般市民游行的队伍中，有一位领着两个孩子的家庭主妇说：“我想无论怎样也要参加一次示威游行，叫岸信介他们听一听‘无声人民的声音’。所以今天我下决心参加了这次游行。作为一个母亲，我绝对不承认新日美‘安全条约’！”
    在白天的国民大会上，社会党书记长江田三郎、日本共产党主席野坂参三、话剧演员泷泽修都分别讲了话。泷泽修是代表文化界的“安全条约”批判会讲话的。他说：“艺术家决不能脱离群众的斗争而使自己埋头于艺术之中。我们现在主动地参加了争取民主、和平与独立的斗争。这一斗争是比我们所演过的任何名著都伟大的史剧。我们能以在这个人民的史剧的整个演出当中，担任一个忠实的角色而感到自豪和感激。”与会者对泷泽修的讲话报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三在讲话中首先强调，日本人民已经取得了一定的胜利。他说：“日本人民的力量迫使艾森豪威尔中止访日之行，打乱了他拼凑东北亚条约集团的计划。而且我们已经把大半个岸信介赶进了棺材。”他又说：“但是，岸信介从棺材里探出头来还在策划新的阴谋。”野坂主席尖锐地抨击了岸信介一派人策划组成岸信介式内阁来镇压人民以及使应该化为废纸的新“安全条约”“生效”的阴谋。他号召以民主的看守内阁解散国会并举行大选，为此要扩大和加强以日本社会党、共产党为中心的统一行动。最后他说：“我们还没有具备进行革命的力量。但是，人民已经明白地显示出拥有推动政治的力量。过去日本的命运是掌握在统治阶级的手里，现在日本的命运却掌握在人民的手里了。我们必须满怀信心地继续进行斗争。”
    分昼夜两次举行的中央国民大会，在通过“国民宣言”的同时，还宣布了岸信介等十几名策划“批准”新“安全条约”肮脏勾当的反动政客的罪状，坚决要求把他们清除出政界。
    中午一过，满天的阴云开始消散，到了傍晚时分已是晴空万里。参加夜间大会的人们，在国会前受到日本社会党和共产党代表们讲话的激励，在警视厅前高呼反对镇压的口号，通过东京最繁华的银座大街前进。走在示威前面的是来自神奈川县的一万五千人的大队伍，他们排成十六人一行，手拉手地挤满了三十米宽的马路。沿路的行人鼓掌相迎，他们撒着自制的纸屑来欢迎游行队伍。在游行队伍通过霓虹灯照得明如白昼的银座大街时，游行队伍的红旗的光芒远远胜过霓虹灯，给人以强烈的印象。这是开辟日本未来的力量的象征。（附图片）
