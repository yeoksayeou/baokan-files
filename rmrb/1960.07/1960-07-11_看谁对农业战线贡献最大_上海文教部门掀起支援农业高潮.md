　　See Who Contributes the Most to the Agricultural Front
　　Shanghai's Cultural and Educational Departments Launch a High Tide of Support for Agriculture

　　(Our Dispatch) Shanghai’s cultural and educational front has launched a high tide of support for agriculture. All departments, based on the characteristics of their respective professions, are doing their best to make the greatest contribution to the leap forward in agriculture.

　　Since this spring, Shanghai's universities, colleges, secondary schools, and vocational schools have focused on accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, organizing teachers and students to conduct extensive activities in rural people's communes in the suburbs. Jiaotong University has successively organized more than 1,000 teachers and students in six groups to carry out technical innovations in Nanhui, Chuansha, Shanghai and other counties. They have completed more than 140 innovation projects in pig raising, harvesting, cultivation, transportation, etc., of which 50% have been promoted and used. Teachers and students of the antibiotic specialty of the Organic Industry Department of East China Institute of Chemical Technology also helped the Maqiao People's Commune in Shanghai County to establish a livestock-use chlortetracycline factory, mainly by indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Pigs that eat this chlortetracycline grow faster and fatter.

　　Many schools also actively cultivate technical forces for rural people's communes. Shanghai Agricultural College sent teachers and students to communes to open training courses, take apprentices, or jointly run schools with other departments in the communes, delivering technology to their doorstep, and training rural technical cadres. This semester, it has trained 75 tractor drivers and car drivers for the communes, and 500 animal husbandry and veterinary personnel. On the other hand, they also adopted the method of inviting commune cadres to study in the school to train cadres. This semester, more than 10,000 rural cadres visited and studied in this school for a short period of time. They have also trained 151 agricultural mechanization teachers for suburban agricultural middle schools. Recently, they have also established an agricultural technology school with 400 students. In the process of fully supporting agriculture, all schools have tried their best to pay attention to combining the characteristics of their majors, so that teaching, scientific research, and labor are closely combined, which not only supports agriculture but also promotes teaching and scientific research.

　　The medical and health departments are also supporting agriculture with a large amount of manpower and materials, actively helping rural areas carry out the elimination of pests and diseases, running rural hospitals, nurseries and other health services. In the first half of this year, medical and health units in Shanghai's urban areas have transferred more than 50 medical personnel to rural hospitals in suburban counties for a long period of time, and more than 200 medical personnel have been transferred to county hospitals in shifts for a short period of time, greatly enriching the strength of county hospitals. At the same time, nearly 200 medical personnel were transferred to form mobile medical teams to treat schistosomiasis in Qingpu County. Many large hospitals in Shanghai's urban areas have established fixed contacts with rural hospitals in the suburbs, and regularly send people to help carry out medical work, guide medical business and help train rural health cadres. Shanghai's urban areas also supported rural areas with a batch of medical equipment such as X-ray machines, electrotherapy machines, blood bank refrigerators, and universal operating tables. All medical colleges have also included supporting agriculture, training rural medical and health cadres, rural health work and disease research into their teaching plans and scientific research plans.

　　Shanghai's opera, film and other cultural workers are also actively supporting the development of rural cultural undertakings under the slogan of bringing culture to the countryside. Shanghai Haiyan and Tianma feature film studios and the Science Film Studio are actively shooting or preparing to shoot films on rural themes. In order to promote the popularization of advanced agricultural technology, Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio has shot twelve agricultural science and education films since the beginning of this year. Now, under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, they are shooting a film on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Three film crews are fighting in rural areas in Henan, Hunan and other places, shooting two films on "Density" and "Engineering."

　　At the beginning of this month, nineteen art groups in Shanghai, including Peking Opera, Yue Opera, and Shanghai Opera, went to various counties in the suburbs to perform in consolation. In the intervals between performances, the actors also went to the fields to work with the commune members, and some troupes also helped guide and popularize rural cultural and recreational activities.

　　看谁对农业战线贡献最大
　　上海文教部门掀起支援农业高潮
    本报讯　上海文教战线掀起支援农业的高潮。各部门都根据各自专业的特点，八仙过海，各显其能，决心为农业的跃进作出最大的贡献。
    今春以来，上海各高等学校和中等、专业学校就以加速农业技术改造为中心，组织了师生到市郊各农村人民公社广泛展开了各种活动。交通大学先后组织了一千多师生分六批在南汇、川沙、上海等县进行技术革新。他们完成了养猪、收割、耕作、运输等方面革新项目一百四十多项，其中50％已经推广使用。华东化工学院有机工业系抗菌素专业师生也以土法为主、土洋结合，帮助上海县马桥人民公社建立起一座畜用土霉素工厂，猪吃了这种土霉素就长得快，长得肥。
    许多学校还积极为农村人民公社培养技术力量。上海农业专科学校一面派出师生到公社开训练班，带徒弟，或与其他部门在公社联合办学，把技术送上门，培训农村技术干部。这学期已经为公社培养了七十五名拖拉机手和汽车驾驶员，培养了畜牧兽医五百名；另一方面又采取请公社干部到学校里学的办法培养干部，这个学期，到这个学校参观作短期学习的农村干部有一万人以上。他们还为郊区农业中学培训了一百五十一个农业机械化师资，最近他们又办了一所拥有四百名学员的农业技术学校。各个学校在全面支援农业过程中都尽量注意到结合专业的特点，这样就把教学、科学研究、劳动三者紧密结合起来了，既支援了农业又促进了教学、科学研究。
    医疗卫生部门也正在以大量的人力物力支援农业，积极帮助农村开展除害灭病、办好农村医院、托儿所等保健事业。今年上半年，上海市区各医疗卫生单位已抽调了五十多名医务人员长期下放到郊区各县农村医院，还有二百多医务人员短期轮流下放到各县医院工作，大大充实了各县医院的力量。同时还抽调了近二百个医务人员组成巡回医疗队在青浦县巡回治疗血吸虫病。市区许多大医院都和郊区各农村医院建立了固定的联系，经常派人下去帮助开展医疗工作，指导医疗业务和帮助培训农村卫生干部。上海市区还支援农村一批X光机、电疗机、血库冰箱、万能手术台等医疗设备，各个医学院也都把支援农业、培训农村医疗卫生干部、农村卫生工作和疾病研究列入了自己的教学计划和科学研究计划。
    上海戏曲、电影等文化工作者也在把文化送下乡的口号下，积极支援农村文化事业的发展。上海海燕、天马两家故事片厂和科学电影制片厂都在积极拍摄或准备拍摄有关农村题材的影片。上海科学教育电影制片厂为了促进先进农业技术的推广，今年以来已拍摄了十二部农业科学教育片。现在他们正在中央农业部的直接领导下，拍摄一部关于农业“八字宪法”的影片，三个摄制队正战斗在河南、湖南等地农村，拍摄“密”和“工”两部影片。
    本月初上海有十九个艺术团体，包括京剧、越剧、沪剧等等剧种，分别到市郊各县进行慰问演出。在演出的空隙，演员们还和社员们一起下田劳动，有些剧团还帮助辅导和普及农村的文化娱乐活动。
