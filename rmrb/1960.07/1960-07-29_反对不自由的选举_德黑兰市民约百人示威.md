Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 27th: Approximately one hundred Tehran residents held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Interior on the 26th, accusing the upcoming parliamentary elections of being unfree. The demonstrators distributed anti-government leaflets.

They told the Minister of Interior, "We believe this election is illegal."

This demonstration occurred as the election campaigns of Iran's only two legal parties—the National Party and the Nationalist Party—reached their climax. The National Party, led by Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal, and the "loyal opposition party," the Nationalist Party, led by former Interior Minister and large landowner Asadollah Alam, were both established on the orders of the Iranian King to use this "two-party democracy" to whitewash his autocratic regime. Both parties pledged allegiance to US imperialism and the Central Treaty Organization military aggression bloc.

The People's Party, which enjoyed high prestige among the working people and the general public, was declared illegal in 1949.

The term of the Iranian parliament is four years. The previous parliament expired on June 9th. The upper house of parliament has sixty members, half of whom are appointed by the King, and the other half are elected. The lower house has two hundred members, with one member produced for every 100,000 people. The date of the parliamentary elections has not yet been determined, and voting will not begin simultaneously throughout the country; it will continue for many days.

According to Iranian election law, women do not have the right to vote.

A Karachi "Dawn" reporter recently reported from the Iranian capital that "(Iranian) people, forced to seek meager livelihoods, have no time to pay attention to election campaigns. What they want is bread, justice, opportunity, and freedom of speech."

    反对不自由的选举
    德黑兰市民约百人示威
    新华社27日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗首都德黑兰约一百人26日在内政部前面举行示威，指责即将举行的议会选举是不自由的。示威者散发了反政府的传单。
    他们对内政大臣说，“我们认为这次选举是不合法的”。
    这次示威是在伊朗仅有的两个合法的政党——国家党和国民党进行竞选运动达到高潮时发生的。伊朗首相埃格巴尔所领导的国家党和前内政大臣、大地主阿萨杜拉·阿拉姆领导的“忠诚的反对党”——国民党都是奉伊朗国王的命令建立的，以便用这种“两党民主制”来粉饰他的专制政权。这两个政党都保证忠于美帝国主义和中央条约组织军事侵略集团。
    在劳动人民和广大公众中享有很高威望的人民党已在1949年被宣布为非法。
    伊朗议会任期四年。上届议会已在6月9日任期届满。议会上院有六十名议员，其中一半由国王任命，另一半由选举产生。下院有两百名议员，每十万人口中产生一名议员。议会选举投票日期还没有确定，投票不是在全国各地同时开始，它将继续许多天。
    根据伊朗选举法，妇女没有选举权。
    巴基斯坦卡拉奇“黎明报”记者最近从伊朗首都报道说，“（伊朗）老百姓迫于谋求微薄的生计，没有心思过问竞选运动。他们要的是面包、正义、机会和言论自由。”
