　　The Secrets of the Crystal Palace

　　In people's minds, the sea is always a huge image. In the past, people understood the ocean as boundless and unfathomable. Now, people study the ocean and utilize the ocean, and more and more secrets of the ocean are being revealed. There are unusually rich and interesting things buried in that vast ocean. But the largest amount of seawater, which is not noticed by people, is more valuable than the animals and plants in the sea itself. According to the information available, there are more than fifty of the one hundred and three elements discovered in the world in seawater. Table salt, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium sulfate, bromine, etc. in seawater are indispensable raw materials for light and heavy industries, medicine, dyes, pesticides, machinery, national defense and other industries. The following are some of the elements that account for a relatively large proportion in seawater:
Water accounts for 96.5%
Salt accounts for 2.72%
Oxygen accounts for 0.19%
Chlorine accounts for 0.28%
Magnesium accounts for 0.13%
Sulfur accounts for 0.088%
Calcium accounts for 0.042%
Potassium accounts for 0.037%
Bromine accounts for 0.0068%
Carbon accounts for 0.002%

　　The content of rare elements is even smaller. Although these elements are present in very small amounts in seawater, if they can be concentrated and extracted, it would be an amazing figure. For example, uranium, processing 500 million tons of seawater can yield one ton of uranium, and processing 70 tons of gypsum from salt fields can yield one ton of strontium nitrate.

　　In recent years, our country has not only started comprehensively utilizing seawater in many larger chemical plants, but has also established many "indigenous" chemical plants and chemical plants combining indigenous and foreign methods, using jars and cans to extract various chemical products. However, from the perspective of current demand, the production capacity of chemical products is far from meeting the needs, but in terms of resources, seawater is an inexhaustible source of raw materials. We have many favorable conditions, with a coastline of more than 10,000 kilometers, especially places like Qingdao, which is surrounded by the sea on three sides, creating more favorable conditions for the comprehensive utilization of seawater. Therefore, how to better comprehensively utilize seawater and increase the production of large quantities of chemical products is still a glorious and arduous task for the chemical industry departments.

　　水晶宫的秘密
    海，在人们心目中，总是巨大的形象。从前，人们把海洋理解成为无边无际，其深莫测。现在，人们研究海洋、利用海洋，海洋的秘密也越来越多地被揭露了。在那一片汪洋的大海里，埋藏着的有趣东西异常丰富。可是那最大量的、不被人们注意的海水，它本身的用途，却要比海里的动植物要宝贵得多。根据掌握的材料来看，世界上发现的一百零三种元素，海水里就有五十多种。海水里的食盐、氯化镁、氯化钾、硫酸钙、溴素等等，都是轻重、医药、染料、农药、机械、国防等工业不可缺少的原料。在海水中所占的比重比较大的有下面一些：水份占　96.5％盐　2.72％氧　0.19％氯　0.28％镁　0.13％硫　0.088％钙　0.042％钾　0.037％溴　0.0068％碳　0.002％
    稀有元素含量更少。这些元素在海水里虽然含量很小，如果能集中起来提制，也是一个惊人的数字。例如铀，处理五亿吨海水得到一吨铀，处理七十吨盐田石膏，就能得到一吨硝酸锶。
    近几年来，我国不但在许多较大化工厂开始综合利用海水，而且还办了不少“土”化工厂和土洋结合的化工厂，用坛坛缶缶提制各种化工产品。但是从目前的需要量来看，化工产品的生产能力还远远满足不了需要，但在资源上，海水又是取之不尽、用之不竭的原料来源。我们有很多有利条件，有一万多公里的海岸线，特别像青岛这样三面环海，为综合利用海水创造了更为有利的条件。因此，如何更好地综合利用海水，增产大量化工产品，仍然是化学工业部门的一项光荣而又艰巨的任务。　（钱京华）
