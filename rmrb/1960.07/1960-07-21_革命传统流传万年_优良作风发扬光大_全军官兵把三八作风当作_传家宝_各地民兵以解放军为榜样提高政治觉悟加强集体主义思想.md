Xinhua News Agency, 20th — The movement to cultivate the "Three-Eight Style" recently and deeply carried out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in recent months has vigorously promoted the sustained leap forward in various tasks of the troops.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army has developed many excellent work styles in the long revolutionary struggle. Chairman Mao summarized these excellent work styles into three sentences and eight characters. The three sentences are: a firm and correct political direction, a hardworking and simple work style, and flexible and mobile strategies and tactics. The eight characters are: unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. This excellent work style is an important component of Mao Zedong's military thought, a concentrated manifestation of the essence of the people's army, and an important factor that enables the PLA to overcome powerful enemies at home and abroad and complete various tasks under extremely difficult conditions. In order to further promote this excellent traditional work style, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a call to the entire army this spring to further promote the Three-Eight Style, requiring the entire army to carry out the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style more broadly and deeply.

As soon as the movement began, the broad masses of officers and soldiers responded enthusiastically. Many troops held report meetings, speech meetings, and forums to introduce the content and spirit of the Three-Eight Style to all officers and soldiers. Some units also adopted the methods of "leaders going down to the company" and "heroes returning to their hometowns" to widely spread the work style among officers and soldiers. Xu Henglu, battalion commander and combat hero of a certain unit of the Shenyang troops, returned to the special-class meritorious company he had led in the past to tell the cadres and soldiers about the glorious history and excellent work style of the company. The cadres and soldiers regarded it as a "family treasure" and were determined to maintain and pass it on in the company. A certain company stationed in Guangxi invited Yang Maozhong, the county conscription bureau chief who had reclaimed wasteland in Nanniwan in those years, to introduce the work style of the "Old Eighth Route Army." The soldiers took the revolutionary old traditions and old work styles as examples to strengthen their work and study. At the same time, all troops also established a number of models of the Three-Eight Style and commended a number of advanced units and advanced figures who have consistently maintained and promoted the fine traditions of the people's army. Among the more than 200 models established by a certain unit in Beijing, there is the "Red First Company," which inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the Red Army and became red wherever it went; and there is instructor Zhang Chenglin, who loves and cares for soldiers and is called a "confidant" by the soldiers. These models have become examples for the broad masses of officers and soldiers to learn from.

Under the ideological guidance of "promoting the Three-Eight Style and rooting the work of the organs in the company," leading organs at all levels, from generals to general cadres, constantly went to the company and decentralized duty units to help with work. Military and division-level organs generally implemented a three-shift system, with two-thirds of the cadres regularly "squatting" in the company, planting "experimental fields," or making roving inspections of work. Many regimental-level organs also implemented a "two-five" system, with each cadre spending five days a week in the company to help with work. After cadres at all levels went down to the company, they ate and lived with the soldiers and talked heart-to-heart with them. Peng Deqing, commander of a certain naval unit, went down to the艇队 (presumably a type of naval vessel or unit) and operated with the sailors. One night, the sea was raging with storms, the waves were turbulent, and there was torrential rain from time to time and thick fog filled the air. General Peng Deqing braved the wind and waves and commanded the exercise on the deck, encouraging the sailors: "Our navy must be trained in the wind and waves!" The general held on to the iron cable and faced the waves until dawn. The officers and soldiers of this艇队 were greatly encouraged. After the general left, the sailors insisted on hard training. Sometimes the waves crashed down on their heads and knocked the sailors down, but they got up and trained again; the seawater stung their eyes, they rubbed them and trained again.

Since the launch of the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style, grassroots cadres at all levels have been able to integrate with the soldiers and become their confidants. Some battalion commanders and company commanders moved into the squad to live, using their own work style to influence and educate the soldiers. Many political instructors and instructors have cared for the soldiers ideologically and cared for them in life. Meng Zhaofu, company commander of a certain air force unit, moved to the fourth squad, which had once had very poor training results, and used the method of old soldiers leading new soldiers to lead the fourth squad leader, teaching him how to care for and love the soldiers, how to mobilize the enthusiasm of all the soldiers, and how to organize and lead military and political training, so that this squad quickly caught up. Because the broad masses of grassroots cadres are in close harmony with the soldiers, the relationship between officers and soldiers in the troops is even closer and more harmonious.

Through the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style, the hardworking and simple work style of diligence, thrift, strict economy, and hard work in the troops has been further promoted. The "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" of the Shanghai Garrison still uses the marching pot seized in the Liberation War. The soldiers' washbasins have been replaced three times and used for nine years. At the same time, the troops are more actively participating in socialist construction, supporting industrial and agricultural production, and sharing weal and woe with the people; they are also more actively engaged in agricultural and sideline production to reduce the burden on the people.

Encouraged by the Three-Eight Style, the atmosphere of learning in the troops is also very strong. More than 200 groups for studying Chairman Mao's works have recently been established at a certain aviation school of the Air Force.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th — In many areas of the country, militiamen are actively learning the Three-Eight Style of the People's Liberation Army, taking the glorious traditions and excellent work style of the People's Liberation Army as an example, and stepping up production, work, study, and militia building.

The militiamen's learning of the Three-Eight Style began after the National Militia Representatives Conference issued the "Ten Proposals." In order to carry out the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style among the militiamen, the Zhaotong County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province held a radio conference, calling on all militiamen to learn the Three-Eight Style and promote the sustained leap forward in various tasks. In order to promote the Three-Eight Style among the militiamen, the Yang County People's Armed Forces Department in Shaanxi Province trained a number of propagandists and reporters, and combined production to publicize the content and spirit of the Three-Eight Style in factories and fields. When learning the Three-Eight Style, the militiamen in Yuxian County, Henan Province, also established a number of models who love the commune, love the collective, and are both labor and martial arts, as examples for each militiaman to learn from. The officers and soldiers sent by various troops to urban and rural areas to help the militia also took it as their task to teach the militia the Three-Eight Style.

Driven by the Three-Eight Style, the political awareness of the militiamen has generally improved, and the collectivist ideology and organizational discipline have been greatly strengthened. After learning the Three-Eight Style, the militiamen of the Fengfeng Coal Mine School in Hebei Province have seen a straight upward trend in their academic performance. The excellent grades in the learning examination accounted for 30% in the second half of last year, and increased to 81% in the first half of this year. The militiamen said: The Three-Eight Style is a treasure, production and training cannot be separated, all militiamen implement it together, and production results are higher every day.

    革命传统流传万年　优良作风发扬光大
    全军官兵把三八作风当作“传家宝”
    各地民兵以解放军为榜样提高政治觉悟加强集体主义思想
　　据新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军最近几个月来深入开展的培养三八作风的运动，已对部队各项工作的持续跃进起了有力的促进作用。　
　人民解放军在党和毛主席的领导下，在长期的革命斗争中养成了许多优良作风。毛主席把这些优良作风概括成三句话，八个字。三句话是：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。八个字是：团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。这种优良作风，是毛泽东军事思想重要的组成部分，是人民军队本质的集中表现，也是解放军能够在极端困难条件下，战胜国内外强大敌人和完成各项工作任务的一个重要因素。中国人民解放军总政治部为了使这一优良传统作风更加发扬光大，今年春天向全军发出进一步发扬三八作风的号召，要求全军把培养三八作风运动更广泛深入地开展起来。
　　运动一开始，广大官兵就群起响应。许多部队举行了报告会、演讲会、座谈会，向全体官兵介绍三八作风的内容和精神。有些单位还采取“首长下连队”、“英雄回娘家”的方法，在官兵中大传作风。沈阳地区部队某部营长、战斗英雄徐恒禄，回到他过去带领过的特等功臣连，给干部战士讲连队的光荣历史和优良作风，干部战士都把它当作“传家宝”，决心在连里保持和传留下去。驻广西部队某连，请当年在南泥湾开过荒的县兵役局长杨茂忠介绍“老八路”作风，战士们纷纷以革命老传统、老作风为榜样，加强自己的工作和学习。在这同时，各部队也都树立了一批三八作风的标兵，表扬了一些一贯保持和发扬了人民军队优良传统的先进单位、先进人物。北京某部队树立的二百多个标兵中，有继承和发扬了红军优良传统、走到那里红到那里的“红一连”；有热爱和体贴士兵、被士兵称为“知心人”的指导员张成林。这些标兵都成为广大官兵的学习榜样。
    各级领导机关在“发扬三八作风，让机关工作扎根到连队”的思想指导下，从将军到一般干部不断到连队和分散执勤的单位去帮助工作。军、师两级机关，普遍实行了三班制，经常有三分之二的干部在连队“蹲点”、种“试验田”或巡回检查工作。许多团级机关还实行了“二五”制，每个干部每周有五天在连队帮助工作。各级干部下连以后，都作到了同吃、同住、和战士促膝谈心。海军某部司令员彭德清将军下到艇队，和水兵们一起操作。一天夜里，海上暴风怒吼，波涛汹涌，时而大雨倾盆，时而浓雾弥漫。彭德清将军冒着风浪颠簸，在甲板上指挥操练，并鼓舞水兵说：　“我们海军要在风浪中锻炼出来！”将军扶着铁索，迎着浪打，直到天明。这支艇队官兵受到了巨大鼓舞，将军走后，水兵们坚持苦练，有时大浪劈头盖来，打得水兵倒下，爬起来再练；海水刺痛了眼睛，揉一揉又练。
    各级基层干部从培养三八作风的运动开展以来，更能与战士打成一片，做战士的知心人。有些营长、连长，搬到班里去住，用自己的作风影响和教育战士，许多教导员和指导员，做到思想上关怀战士，生活上体贴战士。空军某部连长孟昭福，搬到一度训练成绩很差的四班去，用老兵带新兵的办法带四班长，教他怎样关心和爱护战士，怎样发动全班战士的积极性，怎样组织和领导军政训练，使这个班很快赶了上去。由于广大基层干部与战士心心相印，部队的官兵关系更加亲密融洽。
    经过培养三八作风运动，部队的克勤克俭，厉行节约，吃苦耐劳的艰苦朴素作风，更加发扬光大。上海警备部队“南京路上好八连”，现在仍然用解放战争中缴获的行军锅。战士们的洗脸盆，换了三次底，用了九年。在这同时，各部队更加积极参加社会主义建设，支援工农业生产，和人民同甘共苦；更积极地进行农副业生产，减轻人民负担。
    在三八作风的鼓舞下，部队的学习空气也大为浓厚。空军某航校最近期间成立了二百多个学习毛主席著作小组。
    据新华社20日讯　全国许多地区的民兵，目前正在积极学习人民解放军的三八作风，以人民解放军的光荣传统和优良作风为榜样，加紧生产、工作、学习和民兵建设。
    民兵学习三八作风是从全国民兵代表会议发出“十大倡议”以后开始的。中共云南省昭通县委，为了在民兵中开展培养三八作风运动，召开了广播大会，号召全体民兵学习三八作风，推动各项工作持续跃进。陕西省洋县人民武装部为了使三八作风在民兵中发扬光大，培养一批宣传员、报告员，结合生产到工厂、田头宣传三八作风的内容和精神。河南禹县民兵在学习三八作风时，还树立了一批热爱公社、热爱集体、劳武双胜的标兵，作为每个民兵学习的榜样。各部队派往城乡帮助民兵工作的军官和士兵，也都把向民兵传授三八作风作为自己的任务。
    在三八作风的推动下，民兵们的政治觉悟普遍提高，集体主义思想和组织纪律性大为加强。河北峰峰煤矿学校的民兵，学习三八作风以后，学习成绩直线上升，去年下半年学习考试优秀成绩占30％，今年上半年提高到81％。民兵们说：三八作风是件宝，生产训练离不了，全体民兵齐贯彻，生产成绩日日高。
