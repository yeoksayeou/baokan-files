　　White Paper, New Picture
　　--A Tour of Light Industrial Factories in Qinghai Province
　　Wang Wenyu
    In Qinghai, people always talk about their own "Kangning" brand milk powder, "Qinghai Lake" brand radios, "Xining" brand beer, Xining carpets... with joy and pride. Think about it, in the short span of ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have increased the province's light industrial products from more than 30 in the early days of liberation to more than 2,000 now, and more than 1,000 products have achieved self-sufficiency. How can this not make people happy and proud!
    Just take a walk through a few light industrial factories, and you can feel the fighting pulse of the vast number of workers on the light industrial front in Qinghai Province who "want to work, want to revolutionize," and listen to their bold leap forward songs!
      Arm Yourself with Your Own Hands
    Walking into the indigenous production workshop of the woolen textile factory, you can see piles of wool that has been removed of dead hair and impurities. After being processed by the wool carding machine, it becomes like white clouds in the sky. Beside the electric spinning machine, more than fifty female textile workers simply twist the carded wool to spin it into even yarns with suitable twist. On the newly trial-produced electric iron-wood weaving machine, the shuttle moves steadily and quickly back and forth like a meteor, weaving beautiful and aesthetic paper-making felt, carpet grey cloth...

    However, who would have thought that this place was still a field a year ago, and there was not the slightest sound of machines? This factory began construction in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and was officially put into production on June 1 last year. At that time, more than 95% of the factory's more than 600 workers were apprentices, with no technical personnel, no equipment, no materials, and no drawings. So some people said: "Without materials or drawings, is it possible to make equipment by ourselves?" However, difficulties always give way in front of heroic people. With the support of the factory party committee, the vast number of workers looked for materials if they didn't have them; looked for drawings if they didn't have them; built their own processing plants if they didn't have them; and learned to do things if they didn't have experience. After three months of hard work, they finally created the first indigenous wooden loom and produced the first piece of paper-making wool fabric in Qinghai Province. Since then, a wave of manufacturing indigenous machines has swept through every corner of the factory. Not long ago, it was rated as one of the national advanced production units by the National Textile Industry Department of the Central Government and the National Textile Trade Union.
      Make Your Own Equipment If You Don't Have It
    When night falls, the glass workshop of the Qinghai Ceramics Factory presents a magnificent scene: in this spacious and bright factory building, more than 80 meters long, more than 30 meters wide, and more than 40 meters high, two crucibles are burning fiercely, and crucibles are spewing dazzling fire, embedded in the arched furnace walls, like twinkling stars. The blower takes out the white-hot glass solution from the crucible, and in a blink of an eye, it is made into exquisite, white and transparent measuring cups, measuring cylinders, vases, and various tower-shaped, spherical, and hemispherical electrical materials. The mechanic puts the glass solution into the bottle-making machine, and when the air pump is turned on, six beer bottles or various packaging bottles can be made per minute...

    Here, if you meet any worker, they will talk about the changes in this glass workshop in a proud tone. Some old workers in the workshop often say with joy and humor: "Some people say that we are old workers, and that sounds right and wrong. Why? To say it's right, we have indeed sweated together with it since the construction of this workshop; to say it's wrong, we are also novices, because this workshop is only a little over a year old!"
    A year ago, this was still a wasteland. Five or six glass workers who had just learned simple operations from other provinces built a tent with straw mats, built an indigenous crucible with waste bricks, installed four crucibles, and began to bake the first kiln of glass in Qinghai Province. At that time, the iron pipes used by the blowers were borrowed, and the models for making glass teacups were picked up from the waste pile of the Xi'an Glass Factory. The products produced every day were only glass cups, glass tubes, and kerosene lamp covers calculated in "pieces". For a period of time, their task completion was seriously affected because the supply of crucibles was not timely. At that time, the factory party committee issued a call to the workers to "make our own equipment if we don't have it, and resolutely break through the crucible barrier," and actively supported the proposal of Gu Zongwu, a fifth-grade ceramic water pipe worker, and other comrades who dared to think, dared to act, and dared to try to make crucibles. They consulted the few reference materials they found from other provinces, found their own green clay, kaolin and other raw materials, and collected mud, refined mud, and made molds themselves. At first, the self-made crucibles could not withstand the high temperature, and they either exploded or deformed after being burned. However, they were not discouraged, and they experimented again after each failure, and finally made crucibles. Demand New Raw Materials from Nature
            "Old Qinghai," everyone knows the mellow and fragrant "Huzhu Wine." The Qinghai Huzhu Winery, which produces "Huzhu Wine," had only four employees and a small distillery with a daily output of 200 kilograms of white wine in 1951. By 1959, it had developed into a relatively complete and medium-sized white wine factory, undertaking the task of supplying white wine for the entire province. Now, the factory has built a new alcohol workshop with an annual output of 500 tons and a beer workshop with an annual output of 500 tons, and the production capacity has reached 1,500 tons per year. It not only produces "Huzhu Wine," but also can brew "Xining" brand beer, "Xining" brand fruit juice, and more than a dozen other kinds of wine.

    When you are drinking these mellow and fragrant wines, if no one tells you, you would never think that these wines are brewed from wild plants, wood chips, wheat bran, wheat straw, etc.
    Using grain to make wine is regarded as a legal convention since ancient times. However, this year, the workers of this factory broke the superstitious and conservative idea of "no wine without grain," and vigorously engaged in the brewing and comprehensive utilization of various agricultural and sideline products and wild plants. They successfully trial-brewed white wine using the wild herbaceous fruits of Lambuzi, wheat straw, poplar leaves, and Chinese herbal medicine Phytolacca acinosa and Stellera chamaejasme, which are abundant in the province. They also hydrolyzed wood chips with water to make alcohol with a degree of more than 95 degrees. In the hydrolysis of wood chips, they also comprehensively utilized the hydrolyzed wood chips to make fiberboard and activated carbon.

    At present, the vast number of workers on the light industrial front in Qinghai Province are building factories on flat ground with heroic spirit and producing more inexpensive and high-quality new products. Today, on this "poor and blank" white paper before liberation, the most beautiful pictures are being drawn. (Attached picture)

　　白纸新图
　　——青海省轻工业工厂巡礼
　　汪文郁
    在青海，人们总是怀着一种喜悦而自豪的心情，谈起他们自己生产的“康宁牌”奶粉、“青海湖牌”收音机、“西宁牌”啤酒、西宁毛毯……你想，在短短的十年里，青海省各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，就使全省轻工业产品由解放初期的三十多种增加到现在的两千多种，而且有一千多种产品已经达到自给，这怎能不叫人喜悦和自豪呢！
    只要随便到几个轻工业工厂去走一走，你就可以触摸到青海省轻工业战线上广大职工“要干，要革命”的战斗脉搏，聆听他们豪迈的跃进歌声！
      用双手武装自己
    走进毛纺织厂的土法生产车间，你一眼就可
    以看到一堆堆除去死毛和杂质的羊毛， 经过弹毛机的加工，变得像天上的白云。在电动纺织机旁，五十多个纺织女工只是轻轻地捻拈着弹松的羊毛，就纺成了条干均匀、捻度合适的毛纱。在新试制成功的电动的铁木质织机上，梭子稳健、轻快地如流星般来回闪动，织出了漂亮、美观的造纸用呢、毛毯坯布……。
    然而，谁会想到一年前这里还是一片田野，听不到一点点机器的声音呢。这个厂是在1958年大跃进的声浪中开始筹建的，去年6月1日正式投入生产。当时全厂六百多名工人中，95％以上是学徒工，没有技术人材，没有设备，没有材料，没有图纸。于是有些人就说：“既没材料又没图纸，要自制设备能行吗？”但是，在英雄的人们面前困难总是要让路的。广大职工在厂党委的支持下，没材料，找材料；没图纸，找图纸；没加工厂，自己造；没经验，学着干。经过三个月的奋战，终于创制成第一台土木织机，生产出青海省第一匹造纸毛布。此后，一个制造土机器的热潮，席卷了全厂的每个角落。不久前，被中央纺织工业部全国纺织工会评为全国先进生产单位之一。
      没有设备自己造
    当夜幕笼罩大地的时候，青海陶瓷厂的玻璃车间便展现出一幅瑰丽的景象：在这座八十多米长、三十多米宽、四十多米高的宽敞、明亮的厂房里，两盘熔炉熊熊地燃烧着，一个个坩锅喷吐着耀眼的火光，镶嵌在圆拱形的炉壁，宛如闪烁的群星。吹工从坩锅中取出烧得炽白的玻璃溶液，一转眼就被制成精致、洁白透明的量杯、量筒、花瓶，以及各种塔形、圆球形、半球形的电料。机工把玻璃溶液放到制瓶机中，气泵一开，每分钟就可制出六个啤酒瓶或各种包装用瓶……。
    在这里，随便碰到哪一个工人，他们都会以一种自豪的口吻谈起这个玻璃车间的变化。车间里的一些老工人常以一种喜悦而幽默的口吻说：“有人说我们是老工人，这话听起来也对，也不对。为啥呢？说对，我们的确从这个车间筹建时起，就同它一起流汗了；说不对，我们也是个新手，因为这个车间的生长才一岁多呀！”
    一年前，这里还是一片荒地，五、六个才从外省学会简单操作的玻璃工人，用席棚搭起一顶帐房，用废砖砌起一盘土熔炉，安上四个坩锅，开始焙烧出青海省的第一窑玻璃。那时，吹工用的铁管是借来的，制玻璃茶杯的模型是从西安玻璃厂的废物堆中拣来的。每天生产出来的产品，只是以“个”为单位计算的玻璃杯、玻璃管和煤油灯罩。有一个时期，他们因为坩锅供应不及时，严重地影响了任务的完成。当时厂党委向职工发出了“没有设备自己造，坚决突破坩锅关”的号召，并积极支持了五级陶瓷水管工顾宗武等同志敢想敢干敢于试制坩锅的倡议。他们翻阅了从外省找来的少许参考资料，自己找青干土、高岭土等原料，自己采泥、炼泥、制模。一开头，自制的坩锅耐不住高温，不是炸裂，就是烧后变形。但是，他们并没有灰心，失败一次再试验一次，终于制成了坩锅。向大自然索取新原料
            “老青海”，人人都晓得香醇、芬芳的“互助酒”。生产“互助酒”的青海互助酒厂，在1951年时只有四名职工和一个日产二百公斤白酒的小烧锅。到1959年时已发展成为一个比较完善和中等规模的白酒厂，担负起全省的白酒供应任务。现在，这个厂又新建起一座年产五百吨的酒精车间和年产五百吨的啤酒车间，生产能力达到年产一千五百吨。不仅生产“互助酒”，而且能够酿造“西宁牌”啤酒、“西宁牌”果子露等十几种酒。
    当你饮着这些香醇芬芳的美酒时，要是没有人告诉你，你绝不会想到这些酒是用野生植物、木屑、麸皮、麦草等酿造出来的。
    用粮食酿酒，被人们看作是亘古以来的法定常规。但是，今年这个厂的职工们打破了“没有粮食不做酒”的迷信保守思想，大搞各种农副产品、野生植物酿酒及综合利用，用本省遍地盛产的野生草本科果实兰布籽、麦草、杨树叶和中药商陆、狼毒等原料，试酿白酒成功。他们并用碎木屑水解，做成高达九十五度以上的酒精。在木屑水解中，他们并综合利用经过水解后的木屑，制成了纤维板和活性炭。
    目前，青海省轻工业战线上的广大职工，正以豪迈的气概，在平地上兴建着一座座的工厂，生产着更多的价廉物美的新产品。今天，就在这解放前“一穷二白”的白纸上，画着最美丽的画图。（附图片）
