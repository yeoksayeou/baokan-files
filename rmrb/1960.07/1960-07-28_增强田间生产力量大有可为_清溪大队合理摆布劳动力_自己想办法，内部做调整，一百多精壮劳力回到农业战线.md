Enhancing Field Production Strength Has Great Potential
Qingxi Brigade Rationally Allocates Labor Force
Finds its own solutions, makes internal adjustments, and returns more than one hundred able-bodied laborers to the agricultural front

(Dispatch from this newspaper) According to the New Hunan Daily: The General Branch Committee of Qingxi Brigade of Shaoshan Commune in Xiangtan, Hunan Province, conscientiously implements the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy" and taking grain as the key link, and comprehensively developing diversified operations. It overcame the idea of waiting for the county and commune to transfer laborers back, and tightened and replaced one hundred and twenty-nine able-bodied laborers from the brigade's directly affiliated enterprises and living service units to return to production teams to participate in agricultural production; Each production team also transferred sixty-four people to the agricultural front in the same spirit, increasing the number of laborers in the entire brigade participating in grain production by 54% compared to the original, greatly strengthening the main agricultural front.

This year, the Qingxi Brigade Party General Branch has made multiple arrangements for labor. In February, it concentrated more than 53% of the labor force to engage in grain production, ensuring the completion of the rice transplanting task. Subsequently, due to lack of experience, the allocation of labor lacked control, and a batch was transferred out one after another. At that time, relying on the old impression that grain production labor accounted for more than 50%, various agricultural activities were arranged, and it was still thought that the problem was not big. However, the General Branch quickly discovered that the agricultural work arranged according to the seasons could never be completed on time, such as arranging to finish weeding in ten days, but it took more than a month. More than one hundred mu of dry land had not been sown, some of the mid-season rice had not been weeded, and late-season rice had not yet begun fertilizer accumulation. Production teams, work groups, and specialized teams (farms) all reported insufficient labor, but could not find the reason. In order to completely solve the problem of insufficient labor, Peng Fuming, the secretary of the General Branch, went to the Bianhe work group of the Shishan production team for inspection, and found that this group of one hundred and twenty people had fifty-eight laborers. After transferring twenty-one, there were still thirty-seven laborers, but only twelve people were working in the fields. Twelve people were engaged in living services, four were feeding pigs and cattle... There were many people at home, but not many people at work. According to the results of a thorough investigation in the entire brigade, in addition to transferring out one hundred and forty-eight laborers, the brigade's industry, sideline occupations, and living welfare units occupied one hundred and eighty-eight people, animal husbandry and aquaculture one hundred and eleven people, living services two hundred and twenty-one people, and only three hundred and fifty-seven people were engaged in grain production, accounting for 35.2% of the total labor force. The enterprises and undertakings run by the brigade, such as specialized teams, pig farms, joint factories, kindergartens, and maternity hospitals, not only used too many people, but most of them were able-bodied laborers. The phenomenon of unreasonable labor arrangement also existed in the production teams and work groups themselves. The main laborers who could do field work were engaged in service work, and some laborers who could not do field work were not properly arranged.

The General Branch thoroughly understood these situations, greatly cleared its mind, and was determined to change this situation. Therefore, it adopted the method of launching layer by layer, explaining the great significance of taking agriculture as the foundation at the General Branch Committee, in the cadres of production teams, work groups, specialized teams, joint factories, etc., conducting ideological mobilization, so that all cadres and masses could improve their understanding and actively concentrate all possible labor on the agricultural front.

How to concentrate labor? The Brigade General Branch conducted specific analysis and research. First of all, it affirmed that all current production and construction should be carried out, and all require labor. The problem is what kind of labor to arrange. The previous labor dispersion phenomenon was mainly due to lack of experience. They first made reasonable adjustments at the brigade level. The principle of adjustment is: for projects that occupy too much labor, those that should be suspended should be suspended, those whose labor should be compressed should be compressed, and those that should be replaced should be replaced. The results of the adjustment are: First, the current canal construction (which can benefit from drought resistance) and warehouse construction (which is about to be completed) occupy a total of eighty people. These two items are currently urgently needed, and efforts should be made to complete them quickly and return to the production team to participate in agricultural production. Second, the brigade's economic crop specialized team, pig farm, and maternity hospital used too many people, shrinking eighteen people back to agricultural production posts; according to the needs of agricultural work arrangements, replace men with women and the strong with the weak, and transfer eight more main laborers from these units. This will not only not affect their own production and work, but also better exert their enthusiasm. Third, the red brick factory and sewing factory are now basically reasonably arranged, without compression or replacement. Twenty-three people were drawn from them during the current busy farming season to participate in "double抢" (rush harvesting and planting) shock work. The joint factory has a large workload and will not be adjusted. In this way, the brigade level has tightened and replaced one hundred and twenty-nine laborers, including one hundred and eight young and middle-aged people aged twenty-five to forty, increasing the number of laborers participating in agricultural production by 36% compared to the original. Production teams and work groups also arranged labor according to this principle, and each team adjusted out sixty-four stronger laborers. Adding the two together, the number of laborers participating in agricultural production increased by 54%. In the adjustment of labor, the labor tightened and adjusted by the brigade was discussed and agreed upon by the brigade general branch and various units. In short, the cadres were educated on concentrating labor and "taking grain as the key link" to unify the cadres' thinking and overcome departmentalism. Individual talks were also held with those who returned to participate in agricultural production, so that those who stayed were at ease and those who left were happy.

Now, this batch of adjusted labor has successively gone to production teams and work groups, adding fresh troops to the current agricultural production and powerfully promoting the current production.

### 增强田间生产力量大有可为  清溪大队合理摆布劳动力  自己想办法，内部做调整，一百多精壮劳力回到农业战线

    增强田间生产力量大有可为
    清溪大队合理摆布劳动力
    自己想办法，内部做调整，一百多精壮劳力回到农业战线
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：湖南省湘潭韶山公社清溪大队总支委员会切实贯彻“国民经济以农业为基础”和以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针，克服等待从县、社调回劳力的思想，从大队直属企业、生活服务单位紧缩和调换了一百二十九个精壮劳力回到生产队参加农业生产；各生产队也按同一精神向农业战线增调六十四人，使全大队参加粮食生产的劳力比原先增加54％，大大加强了农业主攻战线。
    今年清溪大队党总支对劳动力曾经作过多次安排，2月间，集中了53％以上的劳力从事粮食生产，保证了插秧任务的完成。随后，由于经验不足，对劳力调拨缺乏控制，陆续调出了一批。当时凭着粮食生产劳力占50％以上的老印象安排各项农事活动，还以为问题不大。但是，总支很快发现按季节安排的农活老是不能按时完成，如布置十天?完田，结果拖到一个多月，还有一百多亩旱土未下种，一部分中稻没有除草，晚稻还没有开始积肥。生产队、作业组和专业队（场）都反映劳力不足，但又找不出原因。为了彻底解决劳力不足问题，总支书记彭福明便到石山生产队便河作业组进行检查，发现这个组一百二十个人，有五十八个劳力，除上调二十一个外，还有三十七个劳力，可是田间生产出工的仅十二人，余下的搞生活服务的占了十二个，喂猪喂牛四个，……在家的人不少，出工的人不多。在全大队摸底的结果，除外调了一百四十八个劳力外，大队工业、副业、生活福利单位占一百八十八人，畜牧水产一百一十一人，生活服务二百二十一人，从事粮食生产的只三百五十七人，占劳力总数的35.2％。大队办的企业和事业如专业队、养猪场、联合工厂、幼儿园、妇产院等单位不仅用人过多，而且大多数是精壮劳力。劳力安排不尽合理的现象，在生产队和作业组本身，也同样存在。可以搞田间工作的主要劳力搞了服务工作，一些不能搞田间工作的劳力，也没有适当安排。
    总支摸清这些情况，大大清醒了头脑，下决心改变这个状况。于是采取层层发动的办法，在总支委员会上，在生产队、作业组、专业队、联合工厂等干部中，说明以农业为基础的伟大意义，进行思想发动，使全体干部和群众提高认识，积极地把一切可能集中的劳力集中到农业战线上来。
    如何集中劳力？大队总支进行了具体的分析和研究。首先肯定了现在各项生产建设都应该搞，都需要劳力，问题是安排什么样的劳力。前段出现劳力分散现象，主要是由于缺乏经验造成的。他们先由大队一级进行合理调整。调整的原则是：各项占用过多劳力的项目，该暂停的暂停、劳力该压缩的压缩、该换的就换。调整的结果是：一、现在修渠道（当前抗旱中即能受益）建仓（快完工了）共占用八十个人，这两项都是目前急需的，力争迅速完工，回生产队参加农业生产。二、大队经济作物专业队、猪场、妇产院用人过多，紧缩十八人回到农业生产岗位；根据农活安排的需要，以女代男，以弱代强，从这几个单位再换出主要劳力八人，不仅不影响本身生产和工作，还可以更好地发挥积极性。三、红砖厂、缝纫厂，现在安排基本合理，不压不换，在目前农忙期间抽出二十三人，参加“双抢”突击。联合工厂工作任务大，不作调整。这样大队一级便紧缩和换出劳力一百二十九人，其中二十五岁到四十岁的青壮年一百零八人，使参加农业生产的劳力比原来增加36％。生产队和作业组也都按照这一原则安排劳力，各队共调整出六十四个较强的劳力。两下加起来，参加农业生产的劳力共增加了54％。在调整劳力中，大队紧缩和调整的劳力都经过了大队总支和各单位商量同意。总之坚持向干部进行了集中劳力、“以粮为纲”的教育，统一干部思想，克服本位主义。对回去参加农业生产的人也作了个别谈话，做到了留者安心、去者愉快。
    现在，这批调整的劳力，已陆续下到生产队、作业组，给当前农业生产增加了生力军，有力地推动了当前生产。
