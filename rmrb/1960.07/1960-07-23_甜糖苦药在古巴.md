    Sweet Sugar, Bitter Medicine in Cuba
    Liu Feng
    In 1492, fourteen days after Columbus first made contact with the land of the New World, he arrived in Cuba. He was immediately attracted by the magnificent scenery of lush vegetation and bustling life, calling it "the most beautiful place in the world." Until his death, he still believed it was part of the rich Asia.

    The land of Cuba is indeed very rich. Three-quarters of the country is flat arable land, and most of the land is fertile red soil. Frequent volcanic activity in the Caribbean during the recent history of the Earth has provided a large amount of volcanic ash, making the soil here unusually good. Coupled with the warm climate, ample sunlight, and abundant rainfall, it is particularly suitable for growing crops. Of course, without human labor, these favorable conditions cannot play their role. One hundred and fifty or sixty years ago, there was no sugarcane in Cuba. Only after the long-term hard work of the Cuban people did these lands grow dozens of tons of sugarcane per acre, allowing Cuba to produce more than four or five million tons of sugar annually. Sugarcane here can be harvested continuously for several years after planting, some even for more than twenty years, its richness is imaginable. In the particularly superior natural conditions of the western foothills, the Cuban people have cultivated world-renowned tobacco leaves, which are the raw material for manufacturing expensive cigars.

    Not only is the land abundant, but Cuba also has huge resources underground. More than two-thirds of the nickel ore reserves in the capitalist world are buried underground in Cuba. Cuba also has a lot of chromite, an important raw material for steelmaking, many times more than the United States, and iron ore reserves are even more than those of France, an old iron-producing country.

    With so many resources above and below ground, the Cuban people should be very wealthy, but early investigation materials showed that the caloric intake of a five-person worker's family per day could only meet the needs of one person.

    The reason for this contradictory phenomenon is clear. Although the Cuban people have abundant resources, they are not the masters of the resources themselves. Cuba produces a lot of sugar and tobacco leaves, and as a result, they are plundered by American and other imperialists to extract high profits. According to statistics in 1955, Cuba accounted for about one-third of the total sugar exports in the capitalist world, and almost 100% of the sugar and tobacco leaves produced in Cuba were exported, accounting for more than 90% of Cuba's total exports. These trades were completely controlled by imperialists, mainly the United States. The U.S. imperialism extracted profits as high as 500% from the Cuban sugar industry. They sucked a lot of blood and sweat from the Cuban people, just as an American imperialist couldn't help but write in a book: "Cuba is so close to us, it is the happiness of our America." Yes, U.S. imperialism is "happy," but the Cuban people have suffered deep disasters. The agricultural system of simply producing sugarcane and tobacco and the heavy exploitation of colonialism have made it impossible for the Cuban people to obtain the necessary food, vegetables, and clothing. Sweet sugar has become bitter medicine. As the famous Cuban poet Guillén described: "How sweet is the appearance of my motherland, but how painful is the heart..."

    Cuba's rich underground resources are also controlled by imperialism. Although Cuba is rich in nickel, iron, and chromium, it has not been developed. Among them, such as chromium, because it is the raw material for smelting high-quality steel, American imperialism intends to store it there for "emergency" needs, so it deliberately hinders mining, because it feels that Cuba is the most reliable "backyard."

    However, under the cruel oppressive education of American imperialism, a teacher by negative example, the Cuban people have awakened, and an "earthquake" has occurred in the "backyard." The Cuban people overthrew the Batista regime, a running dog of American imperialism, and successively took back the control of many resources. How can American imperialism not feel heartbroken? They have continuously used many tricks to sabotage the Cuban revolution, but because of the unity of the Cuban people and the support of the people all over the world, American imperialism is bound to fail. After the Cuban revolution, last year not only increased sugar production to nearly six million tons, but also vigorously developed diversified operations such as grain and vegetables, which increased national income by 17% compared with the previous year. The attempt of American imperialism to use the "sugar club" to sabotage the Cuban revolution is doomed to failure. The Cuban people will surely live better, and contribute to the people all over the world with their rich resources, because the Cuban people today have become "the masters of their own land."

    甜糖苦药在古巴
    柳风
    1492年，当哥仑布第一次接触新大陆的土地以后十四天，来到了古巴，他马上被这里植物繁茂生命喧嚣的壮丽景色吸引住了，称之为“世界上最美丽的地方”。一直到他死还以为这就是富饶的亚洲的一部分。
    古巴的土地的确是很富饶的，全国有四分之三面积是平坦的可耕地，大部分土地是肥沃的红色土壤。地球最近历史时期在加勒比海一带频繁的火山活动，提供了大量的火山灰，使这里的土壤变得少有的优良，加上这里气候温暖，日光充足，雨水丰富，特别适宜种植庄稼。当然，如果没有人的劳动，这些有利条件并不能发挥作用。在一百五、六十年以前，古巴并没有甘蔗，只是经过古巴人民胼手胝足的长期劳动以后，才使这些土地竟能在每英亩的面积上生长几十吨甘蔗，使古巴出产的糖每年达四、五百万吨以上。这里的甘蔗在种下以后可以连续收成几年，有的竟可连收二十几年，其富饶可想而知。在西部山麓特别优越的自然条件下，古巴人民培植出了世界闻名的烟叶，成为制造名贵的雪茄烟的原料。
    不仅地上丰收，古巴的地下也有着巨大的富源，资本主义世界所蕴藏的镍矿有三分之二以上埋在古巴的地下，重要的炼钢原料铬铁矿古巴也有很多，比美国多几十倍，而铁矿的储藏量则比老牌的产铁国法国还要多。
    地上地下有这样多的富源，按说古巴人民应该很富裕了，但是早些时候的调查材料表明，一个五口的工人家庭每天所得食物的热量仅能满足一个人的需要。
    造成这种矛盾现象的原因很清楚，古巴人民虽然有富饶的资源，但自己却不是资源的主人。古巴生产了许多糖和烟叶，结果，被美国等帝国主义掠夺去攫取高额利润。据1955年统计，资本主义世界糖的出口总额中，古巴占了三分之一左右，而古巴生产的糖和烟叶几乎百分之百地输出了，占古巴出口总额的90％以上，这些贸易完全控制在以美国为主的帝国主义手里。古巴的对外贸易有80％为美帝国主义所控制，美帝国主义在古巴糖业中所攫取的利润高达500％。他们吮吸着古巴人民大量的血汗，正如一个美国帝国主义分子在一本书中情不自禁地所写下的：“古巴这岛和我们离得极近，是我们美国的幸福”。是的，美帝国主义“幸福”了，古巴人民则遭受到深重的灾难，单纯生产甘蔗和烟草的农业制度和殖民主义的沉重剥削使古巴人民得不到必要的粮食、菜蔬和衣著，甜糖成了苦药。正如古巴著名诗人纪廉所描述的：“我的祖国外表多么甜蜜，内心却多么痛苦……”
    古巴丰富的地下资源也为帝国主义所控制。尽管古巴的镍、铁、铬都很丰富，但得不到开发，其中如铬，由于是炼优质钢的原料，美帝国主义打算储备在那里以备“非常时期”之需，便有意阻碍开采，因为他觉得古巴是最可靠的“后院”了。
    然而在美帝国主义这个反面教员残酷压迫的教育下，古巴人民觉醒了，“后院”发生了“地震”。古巴人民推翻了美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔政权，陆续把许多资源的控制权夺取回来了，美帝国主义怎能不痛彻肺腑呢。他们已连续使出了许多破坏古巴革命的花招，但是由于古巴人民的团结一致和全世界人民的支持，美帝国主义一定要失败。在古巴革命以后，去年不仅把糖产量增加到将近六百万吨，而且大力发展了粮食和蔬菜等多种经营，使国民收入比前一年增加了17％。美帝国主义想利用“食糖大棒”来破坏古巴革命的企图是注定要失败的，古巴人民一定能生活得更好，而且以自己丰富的资源向全世界人民作出贡献，因为古巴人民今天已成了“自己土地的主人”。
