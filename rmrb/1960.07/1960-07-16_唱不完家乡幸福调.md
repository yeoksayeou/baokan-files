　　Endless Tunes of Hometown Happiness
　　Liu Zhang, Banbishan Commune, Xinglong, Hebei

　　Plowing: Green and lush fields, red flags flutter, the "di-da" sounds the call to work. Commune members arrive at the ridges, only to find the branch secretary already there. Plowing while chatting, asking about the base fertilizer and spring seedlings. Talking while working quickly, deep plowing without missing a weed. Young men give a thumbs-up in praise, old men stroke their beards and smile. “Don’t underestimate the branch secretary's humble origins, his brain is full of miraculous cures. When the branch secretary arrives in the fields, the seedlings thrive; when the branch secretary goes to the mountains, the saplings grow tall; when the branch secretary herds sheep, the flock prospers; when the branch secretary raises pigs, the pigs get fat.” The branch secretary, without straightening his back, replies, “These miraculous cures are created by everyone!”
   
　　Evening: Evening glow like a curtain drawn across the mountain peaks, stars like electric lights hung in the sky. The stacks of wheat on the threshing ground like small mountains, inside and outside the ground, ten thousand layers of mountains. Young men play the erhu, blind men pluck the strings. The first item on the program is a chorus, singing "The People's Commune is Good," the second item is "Celebrating the Harvest," young men sing and girls dance. One, two, three, four, old and young all take turns. After half an hour of the evening party, everyone goes to the night battle. Winnowing and threshing non-stop, talking and laughing on both sides. The evening party is over, enthusiasm remains, the singing louder and louder. Loving the commune, great enthusiasm, endless tunes of hometown happiness.

　　唱不完家乡幸福调
　　河北兴隆半壁山公社　刘章
  锄　地绿油油田野红旗飘，的达响起出工号。社员齐到垅头上，谁知支书已早先到。边锄地来边拉话，问过底粪问春苗。嘴里说话手头快，下土深来不丢草。小伙子竖起拇指夸，大伯捋着胡子笑。“别看支书扛活出身，脑子里满是灵丹妙药。支书到田苗儿好，支书上山树秧高。支书放羊羊群旺，支书放猪猪上膘。”支书听罢没直腰，“妙药灵丹是大伙造！”
    晚　会晚霞像幕拉上山尖，星星像电灯挂满天。场上麦垛像小山，场里场外万重山。小伙子把二胡拉，老盲人把弦子弹。头一个节目大合唱，唱的是《人民公社好》，二一个节目《庆丰收》，小伙子唱歌姑娘跳。一个两个三四个，老人小孩轮个到。晚会进行半点钟，大伙去把夜战搞。扬场打麦忙不停，这边说来那边笑。晚会开完兴致在，歌声一阵比一阵高。爱公社呀干劲大，唱不完家乡幸福调。
