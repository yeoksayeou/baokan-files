"Three-Way Combination" is a Good Way to Handle Internal Contradictions in Enterprises
CPC Beijing Civil Lamp Factory General Branch Committee

    Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and applying Chairman Mao's theory to examine our "three-way combination" work, we deeply realized that Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is a priceless treasure for socialist construction.

    Our factory is a joint state-private enterprise formed by the merger of thirty-nine private small businesses. After the revolution in the ownership system and the subsequent rectification movement, it has only been a little over two years, and the face of the factory has been completely changed. In such a short period, how could we transform a "handicraft workshop" using hammers and scissors into a mechanized and semi-mechanized factory with rows of machines? How could we increase the output value by fifteen times in two years? How could we make leading cadres become production experts who can labor, understand technology, and connect with the masses? How could we closely integrate technicians and workers, becoming as close as family members? How could we make workers become new-type workers with high awareness, culture, technology, and enterprise management skills? How did this leap-forward change occur? We believe that the most important reason is that, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, we earnestly implemented the instructions of the higher party committee, adhered to the spirit of rectification, and used the form of "three-way combination" to continuously adjust the relationship between leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and to continuously and correctly resolve internal contradictions in the enterprise.

    "Three-Way Combination" is the Product of Consciously Handling Internal Contradictions in Enterprises

    The "three-way combination" in our factory was developed on the basis of the rectification movement and the "two participations, one reform." Initially, when solving some production technology problems, factory-level leading cadres only combined with management cadres and technicians. Due to being detached from production labor, their understanding could not comprehensively and correctly reflect objective reality. The formulated plans and programs often had significant contradictions with the actual situation during implementation, and they had to be greatly modified or even completely overturned. Leading cadres began to realize that management personnel and workers needed to combine, and sometimes they would absorb some old workers to participate in discussions, and the situation did improve. However, at that time, workers were still only like guests, being invited to offer opinions, and the "three-way combination" meetings only stayed at the top level, and the issues discussed were all raised by the leaders. The Great Leap Forward since 1958, especially the technical revolution movement, made leading cadres, workers, and technicians all feel that without mutual combination, it would be impossible to solve production problems more, faster, better, and more economically. This made "three-way combination" a fixed and widely adopted important system. Not only old workers participated in the "three-way combination," but also apprentices.

  The "three-way combination" meetings were also moved from the factory headquarters to the workshops and groups, and closely integrated with on-site meetings. The content of the "three-way combination" also became richer. Issues related to technical revolution, production management, technical management, product design, labor organization, etc., were all resolved through the "three-way combination." The masses also created forms such as "one unified, three fixed" (unified research and planning of production and technical issues through "three-way combination," and fixing people, tasks, and time to ensure implementation) and "three-way combination professional teams," which further developed the "three-way combination."

    "Three-way combination" is the product of acknowledging internal contradictions in enterprises and continuously and consciously handling internal contradictions; it is also the best way to adjust the relationship between people within the enterprise and to resolve internal contradictions in the enterprise.

    Close Combination of Leading Cadres and Workers, Continuous Resolution of Contradictions, and Promotion of Production Leap Forward

    Using "three-way combination" to handle internal contradictions in enterprises, the first thing is to continuously resolve the contradictions between leading cadres and the masses of workers.

    Are there contradictions between leading cadres and workers? Yes. The nature of the contradictions between leading cadres and workers in our enterprise is, of course, fundamentally different from the contradictions in capitalist enterprises. The contradictions between capitalists and workers in capitalist enterprises are antagonistic contradictions. The relationship between leaders and the masses in our enterprise is already a comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. However, contradictions still exist. It is against objective reality to deny the existence of contradictions. Leading cadres and workers are in different positions in the enterprise, have different divisions of labor, and see problems from different angles, so their handling of problems is often not completely consistent. Inconsistency is contradiction. However, the fundamental interests of leading cadres and workers are completely consistent. As long as they are consciously and correctly handled, these contradictions are not difficult to resolve. In the previous period, the contradictions between leading cadres and the masses of workers were mainly manifested in the bureaucratic work style of some cadres who were detached from the masses. Especially before the Great Leap Forward, individual leading cadres lacked a mass viewpoint, were detached from the masses, and often did not go to the workshop for ten days or half a month. When they did go to the workshop, they would walk around with their hands behind their backs, entering from the east gate and exiting from the west gate. They did not rely on the masses in their work and always wanted to set a framework for the workers, which restricted the enthusiasm of the masses. There were also a few cadres who were not serious and responsible in their work, "pushing, delaying, pulling, and shirking," humming and hawing, and not resolving problems in a timely manner. This bureaucratic work style of being detached from the masses was the main reason for the contradictions between leading cadres and the masses of workers at that time. It hindered the improvement of the relationship between leading cadres and the masses of workers and hindered the full play of the subjective initiative of the workers. Most of the cadres in our factory are from working-class backgrounds, and their ideological style is generally good. However, we are a joint state-private factory, and it is impossible not to leave a greater impact from the capitalist management methods. The thought of not trusting the masses and the bureaucratic work style are concrete manifestations of this influence.

    For more than two years, we have been fiercely opposing the bureaucratic work style of being detached from the masses. The Party General Branch Secretary and the factory director took the lead in going deep into the masses, insisted on participating in labor, and often engaged in "three-way combination" with workers and technicians in the workshop to study and handle key issues. We also insisted on strict requirements for cadres, often grasping cadres reporting on the situation, problems, key issues, and measures of each workshop, which made it imperative for cadres to go deep into the masses. During the upsurge of production and technical revolution, the leading core of the Party General Branch also often took management cadres and technicians and divided them into several groups to go down to the workshops to organize battles on the front line. Recently, the factory has been vigorously developing new products. The General Branch Secretary and the factory director are all working in the workshop, personally organizing three-way combination professional teams to "cultivate experimental fields." The cadres assigned to the workshop almost all participated in several "three-way combinations," not only studying technical key issues with workers, but also often working with workers. Through the practice of "three-way combination," the idea of relying on workers among cadres became clear, the bureaucratic work style was greatly reduced, and the mass movement in management work gradually became a habit.

    The combination of leading cadres and the masses of workers has a clear promoting effect on the development of the technical revolution movement. The leading cadres in our factory all have this experience: without combining with workers, it is difficult to discover key issues; once combined with workers, the key issues come out; the better the combination with workers, the more key issues are discovered, and the more necessary it is to organize "three-way combination" to solve key issues and promote the technical revolution movement. Therefore, Liu Rongjiu, director of the third workshop, said: "The more we combine, the more we need to combine, and the more we combine, the more we love to combine." Because leading cadres combine with workers, the masses' innovative proposals can also receive timely support from the leaders. Some workers have very good innovative proposals, but they are not confident at the beginning. The leaders provide timely support and encouragement, and the workers can resolutely do it. Some workers said: "Whether innovation succeeds or not often depends on a word from the leader."

  "Three-way combination" not only effectively overcomes the bureaucratic work style of cadres being detached from the masses and promotes production, but also makes it easier to resolve the contradictions arising from the different divisions of labor between leading cadres and workers. At the "three-way combination" meeting, people can inspire and supplement each other face-to-face, and problems can be resolved more properly. Leaders can easily understand the specific situation in production and avoid subjectivism; workers can understand the overall situation and consider issues from a global perspective, overcoming the limitations of specific production positions.

    Through "three-way combination," not only were the contradictions between leading cadres and workers correctly handled, and the production leap forward was promoted, but also the appearance of leading cadres and workers has undergone great changes. Cadres have learned some labor skills, understood a lot of scientific and technological knowledge, and become experts in production and skilled in labor, gradually developing in the direction of being both managers and producers while working with workers to overcome key issues and work together. Workers are constantly expanding the scope of participation in management and familiarizing themselves with management work, gradually developing in the direction of being both producers and managers while working with cadres to handle production management and technical management issues. Now, the distance between management cadres and workers has actually been greatly reduced. 80% of the workers in the factory are undertaking various management positions. The factory has promoted twenty-two workers to become cadres in the past two years. Yang Zhenxing, a fitter who was recently promoted to become the deputy director of the workshop, not only has great enthusiasm and contact with the masses, but also grasps management business very well and has been praised by the workers.

    The division of labor between producers and managers will still exist in communist society. The phenomenon of being a producer for life and a manager for life, without being able to exchange positions, is a remnant of the old society and will inevitably be eliminated in the future. It is still a long way from eliminating this fixed boundary, but from the development of "three-way combination," we can already see a concrete path to eliminate this boundary.

    The Combination of Technicians and Workers Greatly Changed the Situation of Theory Being Separated from Practice

    The second contradiction that is constantly handled by using "three-way combination" is the contradiction between technicians and workers. The central issue of this contradiction is the separation of scientific and technological knowledge from production practice. In the old society, workers were used as living machines, and the separation of scientific and technological knowledge from production practice was an unavoidable phenomenon. In socialist society, this separation can be gradually resolved. If it is not resolved, it will hinder the rapid development of productive forces. Most of the technical cadres in our civil lamp factory are from working-class backgrounds, and the influence of bourgeois technical viewpoints is not deep. However, due to being detached from labor for a long time, dealing with books and materials all day long, the work style of being detached from reality and the mentality of one-sidedly pursuing "foreign" things are still quite common. Product design has shortcomings, and workers suggest modifications. The technicians do not discuss with the workers, but order: "Produce according to the blueprints!" In the technical revolution, the technicians design machines, always considering the foreign direction, wanting large and precise machines. The workers said: "It's good, but by the time the machine is made, the production task will be almost completed." Scientific and technological knowledge is produced from production labor and serves production. The two should be closely integrated. The scientific and technological knowledge of technicians cannot effectively guide production if it is not combined with production practice; workers have rich production practice experience, but they do not have much scientific and technological knowledge, and they cannot play a greater role if they are not combined with technicians.

    The scientific and technological knowledge of technicians must be combined with the production practice of workers. However, technicians' blind faith in technology, blind faith in equipment, the mentality of looking down on the masses, and the work style of being detached from the masses hinder the combination of technicians and workers. Continuously overcoming the ideological work style of technicians being detached from the masses is the main key to doing a good job in "three-way combination." In every technical revolution movement in our factory, we regard solving this problem as a key point of ideological work. In 1958, during the "Great Battle of Fifty Days to Realize Mechanization," many technicians shook their heads, saying that this was a "risky plan" and said: "How can workers who weld tin kettles make machines?" However, as a result of fifty days of hard work, the "tin kettle welders" did make more than one hundred machines and special equipment. The workers showed their strength, and the technicians had to "admit defeat." This year, when trial-producing new products, the technicians did not rely on the vast number of workers at the beginning, and there were no results for more than ten days. After the Party branch discovered this problem, they organized a "three-way combination professional team." Once the workers and technicians combined, they found many solutions. Not only did they trial-produce ten new products in more than twenty days, but they also revolutionized the products: for example, a product that was more than one person tall and required four people to carry it was reduced by two-thirds of its volume at once, and it could be carried away with one hand, and the performance and quality were not affected at all. Repeated practice has led the technicians to draw a conclusion: "Combining with workers is indeed effective." "Without 'three-way combination,' it is simply unimaginable to complete so much technical work." Now, technicians have gradually changed from not wanting to go to the workshop and not wanting to go to the workshop to being accustomed to studying problems with workers. All the technicians in the factory have learned practical operating techniques. Some technicians can handle everything from lathe milling to planing, and they often study and work together when studying technical innovation topics with workers. Technician Wu Zijia is simply called Master Wu by the workers.

    In the "three-way combination," workers have also understood many scientific principles, and many practical experiences have been able to be explained theoretically. To reform a piece of equipment, they could only use their hands to gesture before, but now many workers have learned to draw blueprints. The average technical level of the factory's workers in 1957 was only 1.2, but now many people have reached the level of secondary technical schools. Both workers and technicians have gained a lot of knowledge from the "three-way combination," learning from each other's strengths, helping each other, and the situation of theory being separated from practice has greatly changed.

    However, the situation of theory being separated from practice still exists. The difference between starting from books and starting from reality, and the difference between "foreign" and "indigenous" are often the focus of debate at "three-way combination" meetings. This difference is the result of the long-term separation of theory and practice in the old society, and it is impossible to be completely resolved quickly. Precisely because of this, we need to seriously adhere to the "three-way combination" to regularly handle this contradiction.

    Adhering to Putting Politics in Command, "Three-Way Combination" Can Give Full Play to Its Role

    Another contradiction that is constantly handled by using "three-way combination" is the contradiction between putting proletarian politics in command and bourgeois ideological viewpoints. The internal contradictions of an enterprise cannot be resolved naturally once the "three-way combination" is carried out. The specific issues studied by the "three-way combination" can be resolved according to proletarian principles or bourgeois principles. To correctly handle contradictions, it is necessary to have proletarian politics in command. In the process of "three-way combination" studying key technical issues, there are often various one-sided opinions. Technicians are familiar with book knowledge and have more contact with technical data, but they are prone to being detached from reality, one-sidedly seeking large and foreign things, looking down on indigenous methods, and regarding indigenous methods as unscientific, unpromising, and having no future. This is contrary to the principle of hard work, self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main thing, and indigenous methods being launched. The "indigenous" and "foreign" dispute between workers and some technicians is often very fierce. The square holes on the body of the searchlight, because the size and distance of the holes are different, need to be processed separately on five punch presses. Both workers and technicians want to solve this problem. The technicians proposed to make a foreign hole rolling machine, which is a gantry planer type of large equipment, which is short of materials and takes a long time. The workers did not agree and wanted to use indigenous methods. In the "three-way combination" discussion, the leading cadres insisted on launching indigenous methods, supported the workers' opinions, educated the technicians, and organized everyone to think about indigenous methods. As a result, the workers came up with a method of changing the product design (reducing a few holes) and linking the punch presses, which was quickly realized. Twelve processes were combined into one, reducing four punch presses and increasing efficiency by twenty times. The technicians said: "We are just blindly superstitious about foreign things. If it were not for the Party's putting politics in command, and if we did it according to my method, I don't know when this key problem would be solved." If the contradiction between the Party's policies and bourgeois technical viewpoints, departmentalism, etc., is not resolved well, the "three-way combination" will not achieve the desired results, and may even harm the interests of socialist construction. With politics in command and adhering to the Party's policies, not only can wrong results be avoided, but also negative factors can be transformed into positive factors. For example, some technicians do not start from reality and one-sidedly emphasize quality, which is wrong, but if the leading cadres correctly treat the quality issue, the technicians' one-sided views can also prompt the workers to pay attention to avoiding another one-sided view—ignoring quality, so that the contradiction can be properly handled.

    Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Three-way combination" is an organizational form for adjusting the relationship between people and resolving internal contradictions, and it is especially important to adhere to putting politics in command. "Three-way combination" without politics in command cannot give full play to its role, and may even become a formality.

    "Three-Way Combination" Gradually Increases Communist Factors in Enterprises

    The development of "three-way combination" proves that internal contradictions in socialist society are an objective reality. Some people do not admit contradictions, thinking that socialist society only has unity and no contradictions; thinking that socialist society is already perfect and can maintain socialist production relations for a long time; thinking that the only task of socialist enterprises is to develop technology and improve labor productivity. This view violates both dialectics and objective facts and is extremely harmful. Following this view will result in less, slower, worse, and more expensive production, and society will stagnate.

    Chairman Mao said: After the issue of ownership is resolved, "socialist production relations have been established, which are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces. In addition to this situation of production relations being both adapted and contradictory to the development of productive forces, there is also the situation of the superstructure being both adapted and contradictory to the economic base." This judgment is completely suitable for our civil lamp factory. We believe that socialist society is a period of transition from capitalism to communism, a period of alternation between the old and the new, so there must be a contradiction between the growing communist factors and the dying capitalist remnants, and a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Our enterprise is also in a transitional period from capitalism to communism, and there is also a contradiction between the growing communist factors and the dying capitalist factors, and not everything is suitable. After our factory solved the issue of ownership, the production relations were suitable for the nature of productive forces in the main aspects, so production can develop rapidly. However, there are still some unsuitable aspects, such as the capitalist enterprise management methods relying on a few people to manage, and the bourgeois technical routes relying on a few people to study behind closed doors, which are remnants of capitalist society and are not suitable for the nature of socialist enterprises. These unsuitable aspects hinder the development of productive forces at a higher speed. Whether to maintain these remnants or eliminate these remnants reflects the struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road. Through forms such as "three-way combination," we consciously adjust the relationship between leading cadres, workers, and technicians according to socialist principles, which can gradually eliminate capitalist remnants and gradually grow communist factors. Now, "three-way combination" has enabled our leading cadres to connect with the masses, be able to labor, understand technology, and gradually become production experts; enabled our workers to become a new type of working class who understand enterprise management and have a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge; enabled our technicians to be familiar with labor production, and combined their scientific and technological knowledge with labor practice. From the development of "three-way combination," we have also seen a beautiful vision—the elimination of the essential difference between mental and physical labor. Therefore, "three-way combination" is not only a powerful weapon for developing production and promoting the technical revolution movement, and a concrete way to develop production more, faster, better, and more economically, but also a very good form for the relationship between people in our enterprise to gradually transition to communism.

    “三结合”是处理企业内部矛盾的好形式
    中共北京民用灯具厂总支委员会
    最近我们学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，并且运用毛主席的理论，检查了“三结合”工作以后，深深体会到毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论，是社会主义建设的无价之宝。
    我们厂是由三十九个私营小企业合并起来的公私合营厂，在经过所有制方面的革命和紧接着的整风运动以后，还不过两年多，工厂的面貌已经彻底改变了。在这样短的时间里，我们怎么能够把一个使用锤子剪子的“手工工场”，变成机器成行成列的机械化半机械化工厂？我们怎么能够使产值在两年内就增加十五倍？我们怎么能够使领导干部成为会劳动、懂技术、联系群众的生产内行？怎么能够使技术人员和工人密切结合起来，亲如一家？我们怎么能够使工人成为觉悟高、有文化、懂技术，又会管理企业的新型工人？这飞跃式的巨变是怎样产生的呢？我们认为，最主要的原因是，在毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论指导下，认真贯彻上级党委的指示，坚持整风精神，运用“三结合”的形式，不断调整领导干部、工人、技术人员之间的关系，不断正确解决企业内部矛盾的结果。
    “三结合”是自觉地处理企业内部矛盾的产物
    我们厂的“三结合”，是在整风运动和“两参一改”的基础上发展起来的。开始，厂级领导干部在解决一些生产技术问题时，只是和管理干部、技术人员相结合，由于脱离生产劳动，认识不能全面地正确地反映客观实际，制定的方案、计划，执行起来，往往和实际情况发生很大的矛盾，不得不作很大的修改，甚至全部被推翻。领导干部开始意识到管理人员和工人需要结合起来，有时就吸收一些老工人参加讨论，情况果然有好转。但那时工人还只像客人一样，被请来提提意见，“三结合”的会议只停留在上头，讨论的问题也都是领导提出来的。1958年以来的大跃进，特别是技术革命运动，使领导干部、工人、技术人员都感觉到，不互相结合，就不能多快好省地解决生产问题。这就使“三结合”作为一种重要制度固定下来，并广泛地采用。参加“三结合”的不但有老工人，而且也有学徒工。
  “三结合”的会议也由厂部搬到车间、小组，和现场会紧密地结合在一起。“三结合”的内容也更加丰富了，有关技术革命、生产管理、技术管理、产品设计、劳动组织等问题都通过“三结合”解决。群众还创造了“一统三定”（通过“三结合”统一研究和规划有关生产和技术问题，并定人、定任务、定时间，以确保实现）和“三结合专业队”等形式，进一步发展了“三结合”。
    “三结合”是承认企业内部矛盾，并且不断自觉地处理内部矛盾的产物；也是调整企业内部人与人之间的关系、解决企业内部矛盾的最好形式。
    领导干部和工人紧密结合，矛盾不断解决，推动了生产跃进
    运用“三结合”处理企业内部矛盾，首先是不断解决领导干部和工人群众之间的矛盾。
    领导干部和工人之间有矛盾吗？有。我们企业中领导干部和工人之间矛盾的性质，和资本主义企业里的矛盾当然已经根本不同，资本主义企业中资本家和工人的矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，我们企业中领导和群众的关系已经是同志式的互助合作关系。但是，矛盾还是有的，不承认有矛盾是违反客观实际的。领导干部与工人，在企业中所处的地位不同，分工不同，看问题的角度不同，处理问题就往往不能完全一致。不一致就是矛盾。但是，领导干部和工人的根本利益完全一致，只要自觉地正确处理，这种矛盾是不难解决的。前一个时期，领导干部和工人群众之间的矛盾，主要表现为部分干部有脱离群众的官僚主义作风。特别是大跃进以前，有个别领导干部缺乏群众观点，脱离群众，往往十天半月不到车间，到车间也是背着手，东门进，西门出。工作上不依靠群众，老想给工人划定个框框，束缚了群众的积极性。还有少数干部对工作不认真负责，“推、拖、拉、扯”，哼哼哈哈，不及时解决问题。这种脱离群众的官僚主义作风，是当时领导干部和工人群众之间产生矛盾的主要原因。它妨碍了改善领导干部和工人群众的关系，妨碍了工人主观能动作用的充分发挥。我们厂绝大部分干部是工人出身，思想作风一般都比较好。但是，我们是公私合营工厂，资本家管理企业的那一套，不可能不留下较多的影响。不相信群众的思想和官僚主义作风，就是这种影响的具体表现。
    两年多来，我们一直猛烈反对脱离群众的官僚主义作风。党总支书记和厂长带头深入群众，坚持参加劳动，经常在车间和工人、技术人员“三结合”，研究和处理关键问题。对干部也坚持严格的要求，经常抓干部汇报各车间的情况、问题、关键、措施，这就使干部非深入群众不行。在生产和技术革命高潮的时候，党总支的领导核心，还常常带着管理干部和技术人员分成几路下车间，在第一线组织战斗。最近厂里大搞新产品，总支书记、厂长都在车间办公，亲自和技术人员、工人组织三结合专业队，“种试验田”，分到车间的干部，几乎每人都要参加几个“三结合”，不但和工人一起研究技术关键，还常常和工人一起干活。通过“三结合”的实践，干部中依靠工人的思想明确了，官僚主义作风大为减少，管理工作大搞群众运动逐渐成了习惯。
    领导干部和工人群众相结合，对技术革命运动的发展有明显的推动作用。我们厂的领导干部都有这个体会：不和工人结合，很难发现关键问题；一和工人结合，关键就出来了；和工人结合得越好，发现的关键也越多，就越需要组织“三结合”去解决关键，推进技术革命运动。所以三车间主任刘荣久说：“越结合越需要结合，越结合也越爱结合。”由于领导干部和工人相结合，群众的革新创议也能够得到领导的及时的支持，工人有些很好的创议，开始没有把握，领导及时支持鼓励，工人就能坚决干起来。有的工人说：“革新成不成，常常就在领导一句话。”
      “三结合”不但有效地克服了干部中脱离群众的官僚主义作风，推动了生产，而且领导干部和工人因为分工不同而产生的矛盾，也容易得到解决。“三结合”会上，三头六对面，互相启发，互相补充，问题就可以解决得更加妥善。领导容易了解生产中的具体情况，避免主观主义；工人可以了解全面情况，从全局出发考虑问题，克服具体生产岗位的局限性。
    通过“三结合”，不但正确处理了领导干部和工人之间的矛盾，推动了生产跃进，而且使领导干部和工人的面貌起了很大的变化。干部在和工人一起攻关键，一起干活当中，都学会了一些劳动技能，懂得了不少科学技术知识，成了生产的内行，劳动的熟手，逐渐向既是管理者又可以是生产者的方向发展。工人和干部一起处理生产管理、技术管理上的问题，不断扩大参加管理的范围，熟悉着管理工作，逐渐向既是生产者又可以是管理者的方向发展。现在管理干部和工人之间的距离，实际上已经大大缩小。全厂80％的工人都担负着各种不同的管理职务，厂里两年来从工人中提拔了二十二人当干部，最近新提拔出来当车间副主任的钳工杨振兴不但干劲大，联系群众，而且管理业务也抓得很好，受到工人的赞扬。
    生产者和管理者的分工，到共产主义社会也还是要有的。一辈子当生产者、一辈子当管理者，不能互换位置的现象，是旧社会的残余，将来是必然要消灭的。现在离开消灭这个固定界限的时候还较远，但是，从“三结合”的发展中，我们已经可以看到一条消灭这个界限的具体道路。
    技术人员和工人相结合，使理论脱离实践的状况有了很大改变
    运用“三结合”不断处理的第二个矛盾，是技术人员和工人之间的矛盾。这个矛盾的中心问题是科学技术知识和生产实践的分离。旧社会里，工人被当作活机器来使用，科学技术知识和生产实践相分离，是不可避免的现象。在社会主义社会里，这种分离的现象可以逐渐解决，不解决就会阻碍生产力的高速发展。我们民用灯具厂的技术干部大部分是工人出身，资产阶级技术观点的影响不算深。但是，由于长期脱离劳动，成天和书本、资料打交道，脱离实际的作风和片面追求“洋”的思想还是不少。产品设计有缺点，工人建议修改，技术员不和工人商量，就命令：“照图纸生产！”技术革命中，技术员设计机器，总是往洋的方向考虑，要大型的，要精密的。工人说：“好倒是好，可惜机器做出来，生产任务也快完成了。”科学技术知识是从生产劳动中产生，又为生产服务的，两者应该密切结合起来。技术人员的科学技术知识不和生产实践相结合，就不能切合实际地指导生产；工人有丰富的生产实践经验，但科学技术知识还不多，如不和技术人员结合，也不能发挥更大的作用。
    技术人员的科学技术知识和工人的生产实践必须结合。但是，技术人员迷信技术、迷信设备、看不起群众的思想和脱离群众的作风，又妨碍着技术人员和工人相结合。不断克服技术人员脱离群众的思想作风是搞好“三结合”的主要关键。我们厂每一次技术革命运动，都把解决这个问题作为思想工作的一个重点。1958年“大战五十天，实现机械化”的时候，许多技术人员摇头，说这是“冒险的计划”，说：“焊洋铁壶的工人哪能造机器”。但是五十天奋战的结果，“焊洋铁壶的”果然做成一百多台机器和专用设备。工人显示了自己的力量，技术人员不得不“服输了”。今年试制新产品，开始时技术人员没有依靠广大工人，十几天没有结果，党支部发现这个问题后，组织“三结合专业队”，工人和技术人员一结合，就找出许多办法来，不但二十多天试制成十种新产品，还对产品进行了革命：如，原来有一人多高、要四个人抬的产品，一下砍掉体积的三分之二，一只手就可以提着走，性能和质量一点没有影响。反复的实践使技术人员得出一个结论：“和工人结合的确有效。”“不搞三结合，要完成这么多的技术工作，简直不敢设想。”现在技术人员已经从不想下车间、不愿下车间，逐渐转变为习惯于和工人一起研究问题了。厂里的技术人员个个都学会了实际操作技术，有的技术员车铣旋刨样样都拿得起来，和工人研究技术革新课题的时候，常常边研究，边干活，技术员吴子佳，工人干脆叫他吴师傅。
      “三结合”中，工人也懂得了许多科学道理，许多实践经验已经能够从理论上来解释。改革一个设备，原来只能用手比比划划，现在不少工人已学会画图纸。全厂工人技术水平，1957年平均只有一点二级，现在很多人已达到中等技术学校的水平了。工人和技术人员都从“三结合”中得到了许多知识，取长补短，互相帮助，理论和实际相分离的状况有了很大改变。
    但是，理论和实际相分离的状况现在还是存在着，从书本出发和从实际出发的分歧，“洋”和“土”的分歧，常常是“三结合”会上争论的焦点。这种分歧是旧社会理论和实践长期分离的结果，不可能很快得到彻底解决，正是因为如此，我们更需要认真坚持“三结合”来经常处理这个矛盾。
    坚持政治挂帅，“三结合”才能充分发挥作用
    运用“三结合”不断处理的另一个矛盾是无产阶级政治挂帅和资产阶级思想观点之间的矛盾。企业的内部矛盾，并不是一经“三结合”就可以自然解决的。“三结合”研究的具体问题，可以按无产阶级的原则解决，也可以按资产阶级的原则解决。要正确地处理矛盾，必须有无产阶级的政治挂帅。“三结合”研究技术关键问题的过程中，往往有各种片面的意见。技术人员对书本知识熟悉，和技术资料接触得多，容易脱离实际，片面求大求洋，看不起土办法，把土办法看作不科学、没出息、没前途的东西，这就和穷干苦干，自力更生，土洋并举，以土为主，土法上马的方针相违背。工人和一部分技术人员之间的“土洋”之争，常常是很激烈的。探照灯灯身上的方孔，因为孔的大小、距离，各不相同，需要在五台冲床上分别加工，工人和技术员都想解决这个问题。技术员提出要制一台洋的辊孔机，这是一种龙门刨式的大型设备，既缺材料，又要花很长的时间。工人不赞成，想用土办法，在“三结合”讨论中，领导干部坚持土法上马，支持工人的意见，教育技术人员，组织大家从土办法上着想。结果工人想出了改变产品设计（减几个孔）和冲床联动化的办法，很快就实现了。十二道工序合而为一，减少了四台冲床，效率提高了二十倍。技术员说：“我们脑子里就是迷信洋，如果不是党的政治挂帅，照我的办法做，不知哪年才解决这个关键问题。”党的方针政策和资产阶级技术观点、本位主义等的矛盾如果解决得不好，“三结合”就不能得到理想的效果，甚至会损害社会主义建设事业的利益。有了政治挂帅，坚持党的方针政策，不但可以避免错误的结果，而且可以化消极因素为积极因素。例如有些技术员不从实际出发，片面强调质量，这是不对的，但是如果领导干部正确地对待质量问题，技术员的片面看法，也可以促使工人注意避免另一种片面——忽视质量，使矛盾得到妥善的处理。
    毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“三结合”是调整人与人之间关系、解决内部矛盾的组织形式，坚持政治挂帅尤其重要。没有政治挂帅的“三结合”，不能充分发挥作用，甚至会流于形式。
    “三结合”使企业中的共产主义因素逐步增长
    “三结合”的发展，证明了社会主义社会的内部矛盾是个客观存在。有人不承认矛盾，认为社会主义社会只有统一没有矛盾了；认为社会主义社会已经尽善尽美，可以长期保持社会主义的生产关系了；认为社会主义企业的唯一任务就是发展技术，提高劳动生产率了。这种看法既违背辩证法，又违背客观事实，是极端有害的。依照这种看法办事，生产就会少慢差费，社会就会停滞。
    毛主席说：在所有制问题解决以后，“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。”这个论断完全适合于我们民用灯具厂。我们认为：社会主义社会是个由资本主义向共产主义过渡的时期，是个新旧交替的时期，因此必然存在着成长中的共产主义因素和死亡着的资本主义残余的矛盾，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们企业也是处在从资本主义向共产主义的过渡时期中，也存在着成长中的共产主义因素和死亡着的资本主义因素的矛盾，并不是一切方面都适合了。我们厂在解决所有制问题以后，生产关系在主要的方面已经适合生产力的性质，所以生产能迅速发展。但是，还有一些不相适合的方面，例如，依靠少数人管理的资本主义企业管理方法，依靠少数人关门研究的资产阶级技术路线，都是资本主义社会的残余，它们和社会主义企业的性质不相适应。这些不相适合的方面，又妨碍着生产力以更高的速度发展。保持这些残余，还是消灭这些残余，反映了资本主义道路和社会主义道路之间的斗争。我们通过“三结合”等形式，自觉地按照社会主义的原则调整领导干部、工人、技术人员之间的关系，就能够使资本主义残余逐步消除，使共产主义因素逐步成长。现在，“三结合”已经使我们的领导干部联系群众，能劳动，懂技术，逐渐成为生产内行；使我们的工人成为懂得企业管理、具有一定科学文化水平的新型的工人阶级；使我们的技术人员熟悉劳动生产，并使他们的科学技术知识和劳动实践相结合。从“三结合”的发展中，我们还看到了美好的远景——脑力劳动和体力劳动之间本质差别的消灭。所以，“三结合”不但是发展生产、推进技术革命运动的有力武器，是多快好省地发展生产的具体办法，而且还是使我们企业中人与人之间的关系逐渐向共产主义过渡的一种很好的形式。
