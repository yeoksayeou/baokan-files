Xinhua News Agency, 12th: New York Dispatch: According to the American "Newsweek" published today, the United States is strengthening its aggressor troops in South Korea. The magazine reveals that the United States is transporting approximately eight thousand soldiers to South Korea in order to strengthen the two divisions of American troops near the Korean Armistice Line.

　　“Newsweek” also said that “American Army officers here have been insisting on strengthening the army” since the Syngman Rhee regime was overthrown.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th: The Korean "Labor News" published a commentary today, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist act of increasing the number of American troops invading Korea.

　　The commentary said that reports indicate that U.S. imperialism is sending eight thousand American soldiers from the United States to South Korea. Disregarding the strong demands and condemnations of the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world, U.S. imperialism is not only failing to withdraw its aggressor troops from South Korea, but is continuing to send more troops. This is not only a blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also a new challenge to the Korean people and an undisguised act of aggression that seriously threatens peace in Korea and the Far East. The Korean people must not sit idly by and tolerate this serious criminal act of the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

　　The commentary said that the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops are the unforgivable criminals who massacred countless Korean elders, brothers, and sisters during the Korean War and turned Korean cities and villages into ashes. They are also the ringleaders who slaughter and plunder our compatriots in the southern half and make them groan in the disaster of hunger, enslavement, and darkness. How can the Korean people tolerate such deadly enemies not only refusing to leave but also increasing their numbers?

　　The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists' aggressive actions and provocative conspiracies can only further expose their robber-like aggressive ambitions and the nature of the most ferocious enemy of peace, and can only further arouse the Korean people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

　　The commentary emphasized that with the support and solidarity of peace-loving people around the world, the Korean people, with the power of their unity, will certainly drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of their homeland. The U.S. imperialist aggressors should put away all their murderous weapons and get out of South Korea immediately!

　　违反停战协定　加紧挑衅活动
　　美国增派侵略军去南朝鲜
　　“劳动新闻”说朝鲜人民一定要赶走美帝国主义
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：据今天出版的美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国正在加强它在南朝鲜的侵略军。这家杂志透露，美国正在把大约八千名士兵运到南朝鲜，以便使美国在朝鲜停战线附近的两师军队得以加强。
      “新闻周刊”还说，在李承晚政权被推翻以后“这里的美国陆军军官一直坚持加强军队”。
    新华社平壤14日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义增加侵朝美军人数的行为。
    评论说，有消息报道，美帝国主义正把八千名美军从美国送往南朝鲜。美帝国主义不顾朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的强烈的要求和谴责，不仅不从南朝鲜撤走它的侵略军队，反而正在继续增派军队。这不但是粗暴地违反朝鲜停战协定的行为，也是对朝鲜人民的新的挑战，是严重威胁朝鲜和远东和平的露骨的侵略行为。朝鲜人民决不能坐视和容忍美帝国主义侵略者的这一严重的罪恶行为。
    评论说，美帝国主义侵略军是在朝鲜战争中屠杀了无数朝鲜父老兄弟姐妹并把朝鲜的城市和乡村化为灰烬的不可饶恕的罪犯，也是屠杀、掠夺南半部同胞并使他们呻吟在饥饿、被奴役和黑暗的灾难之中的魁首。朝鲜人民怎能容忍这样的死敌不仅不滚出去反而增加呢？
    评论说，美帝国主义者的侵略行为和挑衅阴谋，只能更加暴露它那强盗般的侵略野心和和平的最凶恶的敌人的本质，只能更加激起朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    评论强调，朝鲜人民在全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援下，以自己团结起来的威力，一定要把美帝国主义侵略者从祖国的土地上赶走。美帝国主义侵略者收起一切杀人凶器立即从南朝鲜滚出去！
