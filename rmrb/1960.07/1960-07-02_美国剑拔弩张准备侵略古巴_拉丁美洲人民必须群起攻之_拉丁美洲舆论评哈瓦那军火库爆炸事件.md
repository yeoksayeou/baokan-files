Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 29th. The Argentine Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution issued a statement pointing out that the explosion at the Havana armory on the 26th was part of the US aggression against Cuba.

The statement said, "In recent weeks, it has become clear that there is a plan aimed at isolating Cuba and creating pretexts for aggression against Cuba. We can mention Vice President Nixon's shameless statement that the United States has enough power to bring Cuba to its knees; we can mention (US) Democratic Congressman Mendel Rivers' demand for military occupation of Cuba, and the memorandum submitted by the United States to the Organization of American States. In addition to these verbal and diplomatic aggressions, there have been actual aggressions, namely the bombing of the Havana armory."

The statement said, "This atrocity once again demonstrates a sinister policy that is being pursued, a policy that uses any means to achieve its ends." The statement pointed out that US imperialism is adopting this policy in an attempt to drown Cuba in blood, because this country has set a noble example for the fraternal people of Latin America in terms of self-determination and safeguarding sovereignty.

The statement firmly condemned this US atrocity and called on the Argentine people to support and support the Cuban revolution.

Manuel Galich, former Guatemalan Ambassador to Argentina, also pointed out in an article published in the Argentine weekly "Action" today that the Havana armory explosion was a link in the same chain that the United States was trying to "impose on Cuba." In this regard, Galich mentioned other anti-Cuban actions taken by the United States before and after the explosion: submitting a memorandum to the Organization of American States accusing Cuba; and gathering Cuban counter-revolutionaries to organize a so-called "revolutionary front" against Cuba.

Galich also recalled the incident of the "La Coubre" ship munitions explosion orchestrated by the United States. He asked: "Isn't Sunday's explosion the second phase of the previous explosion?"

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 28th. Chilean public opinion has widely condemned the imperialists for causing the explosion at the Havana armory, and has also condemned US Vice President Nixon's remarks inciting interference in the Cuban revolution. In this speech, Nixon clamored that the United States has the strength to bring Cuba to its knees.

A resolution passed by the Women's Committee of the Chilean Popular Action Front stated that this incident shows how brutal imperialism can be in order to overthrow the Cuban revolutionary government.

The "Ultima Hora" published an editorial yesterday saying that as the (Cuban) revolution, which has achieved new social and economic victories, is advancing, the reactionaries and imperialists throughout the continent are anxious and uneasy, and they have already drawn their bows and arrows. The editorial pointed out that as long as the monopoly forces continue to manipulate the policies of the US government, tensions will inevitably increase; however, the conspiracies of the reactionaries and their servants against Cuba will surely be resolutely opposed by the majority of the people of Latin America.

In another article, the "Ultima Hora" stated that if the United States coerces the Organization of American States to pass a decision to interfere in Cuba, it will arouse the indignation of the Latin American people.

Chilean University Professor Hernán Ramírez published an article in "El Siglo" saying that Nixon's remarks that the United States has enough power to bring the Cuban government to its knees are arbitrary words with the characteristics of a thug. This speech shows that Nixon still wants to use the big stick policy that imperialists used to create so many crimes in Latin America in the past. Ramírez then pointed out that the aspirations of imperialism are nothing but the dreams of the dying. He said that if Nixon expects Latin America to support the US's criminal aggression against Cuba, then he is too forgetful. The author pointed out, has Nixon forgotten the situation he encountered when he visited these countries?

    美国剑拔弩张准备侵略古巴
    拉丁美洲人民必须群起攻之
    拉丁美洲舆论评哈瓦那军火库爆炸事件
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯29日电　阿根廷声援古巴革命委员会发表声明指出，26日在哈瓦那发生的军火库爆炸事件是美国侵略古巴的行动的一部分。
    声明说，“近几个星期中，可以清楚地看到一个旨在孤立古巴以及为侵略古巴制造口实的计划。我们可以提到（美国）副总统尼克松厚颜无耻的声明，他说什么美国有足够的力量使古巴屈膝；可以提到（美国）民主党众议员门德尔·里佛斯提出的对古巴实行军事占领的要求以及美国向美洲国家组织提出的备忘录。除了这些口头上的和外交上的侵略之外，还进行了实际的侵略，这就是炸毁了哈瓦那的军火库。”
    声明说，“这次暴行再次表明一种正在推行的罪恶政策，这种政策为了达到自己的目的而不择手段。”声明指出，美帝国主义采取这种政策，是企图把古巴淹没在血泊中，因为这个国家在自决和维护主权方面为拉丁美洲的兄弟人民做出了崇高的榜样。
    声明坚决谴责美国的这一暴行，并且号召阿根廷人民声援和支持古巴革命。
    前危地马拉驻阿根廷大使曼努埃尔·加利奇在今天出版的阿根廷“行动”周刊上发表的一篇文章也指出，哈瓦那军火库爆炸事件是美国企图“强加于古巴的同一条锁链”上的一个环节。在这方面，加利奇提到在发生这次爆炸事件前后美国所采取的另外几件反古巴的行动：向美洲国家组织提出指责古巴的备忘录；纠集古巴反革命分子组织反对古巴的所谓“革命阵线”。
    加利奇还回顾了美国策动的“勒库布尔号”轮船军火爆炸的事件。他问道：“上星期日的爆炸难道不是上次爆炸的第二阶段吗？”
    新华社圣地亚哥28日电　智利公众舆论纷纷谴责帝国主义制造爆炸哈瓦那军火库事件，并且斥责美国副总统尼克松煽动干涉古巴革命的谈话，尼克松在这次谈话中曾经叫嚷美国有实力使古巴屈膝。
    智利人民行动阵线妇女委员会通过的决议说，这一事件表明，为了推翻古巴革命政府，帝国主义可以残暴到什么地步。
    “最后一点钟报”昨天发表社论说，在取得新的社会和经济胜利的（古巴）革命正在前进的时候，整个大陆的反动派和帝国主义者却焦虑不安，他们已经在拔箭张弩。社论指出，只要垄断势力继续操纵美国政府的政策，紧张局势就必然会加剧；但是，反动派和他们的仆从策划反对古巴的阴谋却一定会遭到拉丁美洲大多数人民的坚决反对。
    “最后一点钟报”在另一篇文章中谈到美国企图通过美洲国家组织制造干涉古巴的阴谋时指出，如果美国胁迫美洲国家组织通过干涉古巴的决定，它将使拉丁美洲人民义愤填膺。
    智利大学教授埃尔南·拉米雷斯在“世纪报”上发表文章说，尼克松关于美国有足够的力量使古巴政府屈膝的谈话是具有暴徒特色的武断之言。这次谈话表明，尼克松仍然想使用帝国主义者过去在拉丁美洲制造过这样多罪行的大棒政策。拉米雷斯接着指出，帝国主义的渴望不过是垂死者的梦想。他说，如果尼克松期望拉丁美洲支持美国进行的对古巴的罪恶侵犯，那么他未免太健忘了。作者指出，难道尼克松已经忘记他在访问这些国家时所遭遇到的情况了吗？
