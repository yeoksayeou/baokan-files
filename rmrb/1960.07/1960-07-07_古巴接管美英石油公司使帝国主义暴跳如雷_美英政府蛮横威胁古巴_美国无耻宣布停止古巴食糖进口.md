Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 5th: The U.S. State Department today presented a threatening note to the Cuban government regarding the Cuban revolutionary government's takeover of the American-owned Texaco and Esso oil companies' plants and equipment in Cuba. In this note, the U.S. government rudely expressed its "strong protest" and demanded "immediate reconsideration and cancellation" of this legitimate action taken by the Cuban government to safeguard national sovereignty and counter sabotage conspiracies.

This note, delivered to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, once again exposed the gangster face of U.S. imperialism. The note described the Cuban government's action of exercising sovereignty on its own territory and taking over the American oil companies that sabotaged fuel production and deliberately disrupted the national economy as "illegal" and "violating the moral principles of the free world." The note also shamelessly counter-accused the Cuban government's action as "arbitrary and unjust" and constituting so-called "economic aggression" against the United States.

Prior to the U.S. government's presentation of this note, the British Ambassador to Cuba, Stanley Fordham, also delivered a "protest" note to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of July 4th regarding the Cuban government's takeover of the British-Dutch Shell Oil Company's plants and equipment in Cuba, and demanded that the Cuban government put the operation of this oil company on a so-called "normal basis."

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: Washington Dispatch: The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on the 5th that the United States is suspending imports of Cuban sugar, effective immediately. This action, taken before U.S. President Eisenhower signed the bill recently passed by Congress authorizing him to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota, indicates that U.S. authorities are eagerly using the big stick of suspending Cuban sugar imports to further attack and interfere in Cuba.

The United States Information Service revealed that this measure by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is to prevent Cuba from exporting the sugar that remains to be shipped to the United States this year under U.S. sugar laws before Eisenhower signs the bill. According to reports, Cuba currently has approximately 740,000 tons remaining in its sugar quota for import to the United States this year. U.S. sugar industry insiders believe that Eisenhower may use the power granted to him by this new law to reduce 700,000 tons of it.

    古巴接管美英石油公司使帝国主义暴跳如雷
    美英政府蛮横威胁古巴
    美国无耻宣布停止古巴食糖进口
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　美国国务院今天就古巴革命政府接管美国德士古石油公司和埃索美孚油公司在古巴的厂房设备这件事，向古巴政府提出一项威胁性照会。美国政府在这项照会中，蛮横地表示“强烈抗议”，并且要求“立即重新考虑和取消”古巴政府为维护国家主权和反击破坏阴谋而采取的这一正当行动。
    由美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔递交古巴外交部的这份照会，再次暴露了美帝国主义的强盗嘴脸。这份照会把古巴政府在自己的领土上行使主权，对破坏燃料生产、蓄意扰乱国家经济的美国石油公司加以接管的行动，说成是“非法的”和“违反自由世界的道义准则”。照会还无耻地反诬古巴政府的这个行动是“专横和不公正的”，并且构成所谓对美国的“经济侵略”。
    在美国政府提出这项照会以前，英国驻古巴大使斯坦莱·福德姆在4日晚间也就古巴政府接管英荷壳牌石油公司在古巴的厂房设备这件事，递交古巴外交部一项“抗议”照会，并且要求古巴政府把这家石油公司的经营放在所谓“正常的基础上”。
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国农业部在5日宣布，美国从即日起停止古巴食糖的进口。在美国总统艾森豪威尔签署国会最近通过的授权他削减古巴食糖进口份额的法案之前采取的这一行动表明：美国当局正在急不可待地使用停止古巴食糖进口这根大棒，进一步打击和干涉古巴。
    美国新闻处透露，美国农业部的这个措施，是为了在艾森豪威尔签署这项法案以前，使古巴不能根据美国的食糖法把今年内尚待继续输往美国的食糖输出到美国。据报道，古巴今年输入美国的食糖份额目前还剩下大约七十四万吨。美国糖业界人士认为，艾森豪威尔可能利用这项新法律授予他的权力，削减其中的七十万吨。
