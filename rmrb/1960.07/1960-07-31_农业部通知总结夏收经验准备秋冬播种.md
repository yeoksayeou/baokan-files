Comprehensively Study High-Yield Experiences and Low-Yield Lessons to Make High-Yields Even Higher and Turn Low-Yields into High-Yields
Ministry of Agriculture Issues Notice to Summarize Summer Harvest Experiences and Prepare for Autumn and Winter Sowing
Lingchuan County Quickly Clears Stubble, Plows Land Early, Selects Seeds Early, and Accumulates Fertilizer Early to Prepare for Wheat Sowing in Advance and Strive for a Bumper Harvest Next Year
(Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on July 31 regarding summarizing summer harvest experiences and preparing for autumn and winter sowing.
The notice stated that the national summer harvest is basically over. While strengthening autumn field management, all localities should immediately prepare for autumn and winter sowing. "Good autumn depends on management, good wheat depends on sowing," and the quality of winter crop sowing depends on the degree of preparation. The People's Daily editorial published on July 31, "Lay a Solid Foundation for a Great Summer Harvest Next Year," put forward a series of requirements for the preparation and deployment of this year's autumn and winter sowing. It is hoped that cadres at the county and people's commune levels will study it carefully and, in accordance with the requirements put forward in the editorial, carefully summarize the comprehensive experience of the drought resistance struggle and the summer harvest, formulate this year's autumn and winter sowing plans, and immediately carry out various preparatory tasks.
The notice stated that summarizing experience is the basis for formulating autumn and winter sowing plans. Every people's commune, production team, and every high-yield plot must draw its own conclusions on this year's summer harvest crops. When summarizing experience, attention should be paid to verifying yields, understanding the reasons for the difference in unit yield by a factor of one or two under the same conditions, and understanding the reasons for the wide disparity in yields in different plots within the same high-yield plot; it is necessary to comprehensively study the experience of high yields and the lessons of low yields, and put forward methods to make high yields even higher and turn low yields into high yields. It is necessary to identify the key to increasing production in the local area from the aspects of production conditions, technical measures, and economic work, as well as years of experience, and formulate autumn and winter sowing plans accordingly.
The plan should include the sowing area, plots, deep plowing and land preparation, irrigation, base fertilizer, sowing period, sowing amount, layout of high-yield plots, as well as ensuring the labor force, animal power, tools and other means of production for sowing.
The notice requires counties and people's communes to summarize the autumn and winter sowing plans by the end of August, and to prepare and check the organization of labor, seeds, fertilizers, soil moisture, farm tools, planting plots, and water source conditions for each plot, one by one, to ensure the timely sowing of this year's autumn and winter crops.
(Reported by this newspaper) Communes in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, are starting early to prepare for wheat sowing.
This year, the county's wheat harvest was very good, with an average yield per mu increasing by 7% compared to last year. In order to strive for a greater wheat harvest next year, during the summer harvest, the Lingchuan County Party Committee convened on-site meetings and field comparison meetings in Li Yi, Shahe and other communes, and conscientiously summarized the experience of high-yield wheat. On this basis, a plan for high-yield wheat next year was formulated. The planned wheat sowing area next year will be expanded by 29,000 mu compared to this year, and the target for yield per mu is required to increase by about 25%. In order to achieve this production increase plan, the County Party Committee put forward the call of "This year's bumper harvest promotes next year's, next year's bumper harvest depends on this year, start early and do a good job in preparing for wheat sowing," and required early stubble clearing, early plowing, early fertilizer accumulation, and early seed selection. The communes also specifically arranged stubble fields and adjusted and improved irrigation systems. Detailed arrangements were also made for measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, superior varieties, and close planting.
In order to implement the measures, the County Party Committee held a meeting in early July to conduct inspections and supervision; and transferred 150 cadres from various county-level agencies to work with commune cadres to go deep into production teams to inspect, supervise, and solve problems, promoting the comprehensive development of autumn sowing preparation work in the county. By mid-July, of the 33,000 mu of old stubble wheat fields in the county, 26,500 mu had been plowed once, and 70% of the plowed land had been deep-plowed to a depth of six to eight inches. In conjunction with deep plowing, 19,600 mu of land was applied with base fertilizer, with an average of more than 60 dan per mu. The county has selected 330,000 jin of high-quality wheat seeds, and has generally dried them once. The twelve communes in the county have accumulated more than 7.24 million dan of fertilizer, with an average of 72 dan of base fertilizer that can be applied per mu; among them, the average fertilizer accumulation per mu of wheat fields in Duo Huo and other three communes reached 82 dan.

    全面研究高产经验、低产教训　让高产更高产、低产变高产
    农业部通知总结夏收经验准备秋冬播种
    陵川县早灭茬早翻地早选种早积肥提前做好小麦播种准备争取明年大丰收
    本报讯　农业部于7月31日发出关于总结夏收经验，准备秋、冬播种的通知。
    通知说，全国夏收基本结束，各地在加强秋田管理的同时，应即进行秋、冬播种准备。“秋好在管，麦好在种”，而越冬作物播种质量的好坏决定于准备的程度。7月31日人民日报发表的“为明年夏季大丰收打好坚实的基础”的社论，对今年秋冬播种的准备部署提出了一系列的要求，希组织县和人民公社各级干部认真学习，而且按照社论中提出的要求，认真总结抗旱斗争和夏季丰收的全面经验，制订今年秋、冬播种计划，立即进行各项准备工作。
  通知说，总结经验是制订秋、冬播种计划的基础。每个人民公社、生产队，每一块丰产方都必须对今年夏收作物作出自己的结论。在总结经验时，应注意核实产量，了解在同样条件下，单位产量相差一倍两倍的原因，了解在同样一块丰产方内，不同地块产量悬殊的原因；要全面地研究高产的经验和低产的教训，提出高产更高产、低产变高产的方法。要从生产条件、技术措施和经济工作以及多年经验等方面，找出当地的增产关键，据此订出秋、冬播种计划。
    计划内容应该包括播种面积、地块、深耕整地、灌溉、基肥、播种期、播种量、丰产方的布局以及保证播种的劳力和畜力、工具及其他生产资料等。
    通知要求县和人民公社在8月底以前把秋、冬播种计划汇总起来，并且对劳动力的组织、种子、肥料、墒情、农具、种植地块以及每块地的水源情况，逐块逐项做好准备，检查落实，保证今年秋、冬播种的适时进行。
    本报讯　山西陵川县各公社及早动手，进行小麦播种的准备工作。
    今年，全县小麦的收成很好，比去年平均亩产量提高了7％。为了争取明年小麦更大丰收，在夏收期间，中共陵川县委就在礼义、沙河等公社召开了现场会、田间评比会，认真地总结了小麦丰产经验。在这个基础上，制定了明年小麦丰产的计划。明年小麦播种面积计划比今年扩大二万九千亩，亩产指标要求提高25％左右。为了实现这一增产计划，县委提出了“今年丰收促明年，明年丰收看今年，及早动手，做好种麦准备工作”的号召，并要求早灭茬，早翻地，早积肥，早选种。各公社也具体安排了茬口，调整和改善了灌溉系统。对于深耕、施肥、优种、密植等措施也作了详细的安排。
    为了使措施落实，县委在7月初召开会议，进行了检查督促；并从县级各机关抽调一百五十名干部和公社干部一道，深入生产队边检查、边督促、边解决问题，促进了全县秋播准备工作的全面开展。到7月中旬，全县三万三千亩老茬麦田，已有二万六千五百亩耕过一次，深耕六至八寸的占已耕地的70％。结合深耕有一万九千六百亩地施了底肥，每亩平均六十多担。全县已选好优良麦种三十三万斤，并已普遍翻晒过一次。全县十二个公社已经积肥七百二十四万多担，平均每亩地可施底肥七十二担；其中夺火等三个公社麦田积肥平均每亩达到八十二担。
