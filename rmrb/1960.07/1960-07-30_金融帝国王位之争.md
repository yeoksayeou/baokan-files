The Battle for the Throne of the Financial Empire
　　Lè Shān
　　The great American realist writer Mark Twain once described the American president's exclusive control of executive power, saying: "In our country, it is not only a monarchy, but also a political monarchy inherited by a political clan. Our monarch is more powerful, more autocratic, and more dictatorial than any monarch in Europe. His orders from the White House are not bound by laws and customs, and he can force Congress... He can strengthen and concentrate central power and deprive the states of their power... He can install his cronies in the Supreme Court." Because the president is the most important position in the country, American monopoly organizations have never relaxed their control over this "throne." The provision of campaign funds by monopoly organizations is a decisive condition for achieving electoral victory, so each American president is actually selected by financial oligarchs through the quadrennial election farce of the two parties they control—the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The presidential candidates of both parties are decided behind the scenes by monopoly capitalists and their agents—party leaders—in closed-door meetings. The "New York Times" reported on July 7, 1952, on the Republican National Convention's election of a presidential candidate: "Hundreds of delegates wandering the streets with badges and small flags on their chests think they are playing an important role. In fact, everything that happens is done without their participation, and often without their knowledge." In every presidential election campaign, whether Republican or Democrat, huge sums of money from monopoly capitalists have been received. The American "Christian Science Monitor" said that in the 1956 campaign, the Republican and Democratic candidates spent a total of 200 million US dollars. This is how American monopoly capitalists support people who are to their liking to ascend the presidential throne.
　　Because the world situation is increasingly favorable to socialism and peace forces and unfavorable to imperialist war forces, the difficulties and contradictions within the imperialist bloc headed by the United States are increasing, and the general crisis of capitalism is constantly deepening. The most aggressive and war-zealous forces in the American monopoly groups are actively plotting to directly control the government, in order to adapt to the urgent situation of a dying system. Thus, the episode of Rockefeller running for the Republican presidential nomination arose. However, because the Rockefeller Consortium has not yet been able to establish absolute monopoly power, nor has it been able to completely politically overwhelm other rival consortia, his attempt to personally control the government cannot yet be achieved, so he "retreats bravely" and prepares to make a comeback in the 1964 election. This year's battle for the presidential throne is being conducted by Nixon and Kennedy, figures touted by the American bourgeois press as "promising young men."
　　Nixon's political activities began in 1946 after he returned to his hometown of California after completing his naval service. His "talent" in securing naval orders for Elco Corporation during his service was greatly appreciated by capitalists. After returning to his hometown, Nixon, with the support of Los Angeles financial magnates and gang forces, served as the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives. From that time on, Nixon waved the banner of anti-communism and actively launched political activities. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1948 and actively served monopoly capitalists. He participated in the drafting of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law; during the preparation of the Marshall Plan, he participated in a research group led by Herter (then a member of the House of Representatives) to investigate Europe. After returning to the United States, he desperately promoted the use of means to strengthen the exploitation of working people to save the crumbling capitalist order in Western European countries; he showed his skills in the Un-American Activities Investigation Committee, became the main figure in the Hiss persecution case, and colluded with McCarthy.
　　In 1950, Nixon was elected senator with the strong support of California real estate tycoons, oil giants, and dairy capitalists. His voting record in the Senate best illustrates his nature of loyalty to big bosses. On June 20, 1951, Nixon voted in favor of reducing public housing from 50,000 units to 5,000 units; on June 4, 1952, he voted in favor of shortening the rent control period; on June 5, he voted in favor of abolishing federal rent control; on June 12, he and Senator Nolan jointly proposed a bill aimed at abolishing public housing. These are some examples of Nixon serving real estate tycoons. On August 21, 1951, Nixon voted in favor of a bill favorable to oil companies; on September 1, he voted against reducing the oil depletion allowance from 27.5% to 14%. These are Nixon's actions to serve oil monopoly capitalists. In order to protect the profits of dairy capitalists, Nixon vigorously opposed the import of dairy products from France, Denmark, and other NATO countries in the Senate.
　　In 1952, Nixon was elected Vice President with the joint support of the California consortium and Wall Street financiers. After Nixon took office as Vice President, he still had the right to vote in the Senate. From his inauguration in January 1953 to February 4, 1960, Nixon voted a total of seven times. Despite the small number of votes, Nixon left a shameful record. For example, on June 18, 1953, Nixon voted twice in one day in favor of a so-called defense production bill that protected the interests of large enterprises, increased the profits of capitalists, and was detrimental to small businesses. Another example is on April 22, 1959, Nixon opposed reconsidering the so-called "Bill of Rights" that was fiercely criticized by American workers. This bill, under the guise of protecting "workers' rights," prohibits trade unions from organizing strikes and undermines trade union activities. On February 4, 1960, Nixon voted against increasing subsidies for school construction. These records all show who Nixon is serving.
　　Nixon served as a mediator in the steel labor dispute. This is a tactic used by monopoly capitalists to raise Nixon's status and increase his campaign capital. According to Democratic National Committee Chairman Butler, Nixon secretly agreed to let steel companies raise steel prices after the election.
　　In order to speculate, Nixon, in the past period, while advocating "strength policy," also talked about peace. He also went to the Soviet Union for a "friendly" visit. But since the United States sabotaged the four-nation summit, he has completely revealed his true colors. Nixon recently publicly promoted that the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union may be resolved by war. He frantically clamored for expanding armaments and preparing for war, bragged about America's "attack power" and "retaliatory power," and was hostile to socialist countries. All of this is obviously acting in accordance with the wishes of American monopoly capitalists. Judging from the members of the "Support Nixon for President Club" in New York, Nixon has already gained the support of many Wall Street financiers and business owners.
　　The political background of Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy is no less inferior to his opponent. In his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, he called on Americans to become "pioneers" to cope with the hopes and threats of a "new frontier." He said that the new frontier "is not a series of promises, but a series of challenges." For Kennedy, the concept of "pioneers" is not accidental. Kennedy came from a "famous" family in Boston. His father, Joseph Kennedy, is one of the 75 richest people in the United States. Boston's financial tycoons are famous "pioneers." They took the lead in creating the philosophy of aggression and defending the Spanish-American War, the American conquest of the Philippines, and the American "big stick" policy towards Latin America. The First National Bank of Boston established branches in South America and Cuba, and the United Fruit Company, run by Bostonians, controlled the economic and political control of Central America.
　　Joseph Kennedy served as the manager of a Boston bank and the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard. Later, he moved to New York to engage in speculative trading and became a large financial capitalist. He served as the US Ambassador to the UK from 1937 to 1940, and later resigned because he firmly opposed the US participating in the anti-Hitler fascist war.
　　Kennedy's political activities began under the guidance of his father, Joseph Kennedy. Kennedy's graduation thesis defending Chamberlain, written when he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1940, was written with the assistance of Old Kennedy. After its publication, it was sold in the United States and the United Kingdom and became the first milestone in Kennedy's political life. During World War II, Kennedy joined the Navy and fought in the Far East. After retiring in 1945, he launched political activities in Boston. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946. The "Kennedy Biography" recently serialized by the "New York Post" said: "There is no doubt that Old Kennedy actively campaigned behind the scenes and acted as a matchmaker. He provided funding and conducted publicity and public relations work." In 1952, Kennedy defeated Lodge (the current US representative to the United Nations) in the election and was elected senator. After this election, the Boston "Post," which vigorously touted Kennedy, obtained a loan of up to 500,000 US dollars from Old Kennedy.
　　The period when Kennedy was elected senator was when Senator McCarthy began to be arrogant. As everyone knows, McCarthyism tried to coerce every independent opinion and every thoughtful person to submit to it. It burned books and destroyed culture and art. It attempted to defeat the workers' movement, intensify the enslavement of blacks, stir up racism and anti-Semitism, deceive young people and eliminate all traces of freedom. In the Senate, when McCarthy asked for additional funding for his investigation committee or proposed some cases of persecuting the people, he mostly received Kennedy's vote in favor. In 1954, under the strong condemnation of McCarthyism at home and abroad, the US Senate passed a resolution impeaching McCarthy. Kennedy opposed this impeachment case, and later avoided the shameful record of casting a vote against it because he was hospitalized due to illness. Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy, was a good friend of McCarthy. Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, was an employee under McCarthy. Kennedy himself once said: "In 1953, when my brother was still an employee of McCarthy, it was naturally inconvenient for me personally to protest against McCarthy's actions in 1951 or 1952. This is the essence of the matter."
　　Kennedy was the drafter of the reactionary "Kennedy-Erwin Act" in 1959. This act is more reactionary than the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law. The act stipulates that the Secretary of Labor has the absolute power to force any trade union to submit detailed financial reports and other important trade union files to him, and has the right to hand over these documents to the capitalists... The "Kennedy-Erwin Act" and the "Griffin-Landrum Act" proposed by the House of Representatives constitute the new anti-labor law, the so-called "Labor Reform Act," which Eisenhower signed into law on September 14, 1959.
　　Kennedy's parliamentary records fully illustrate for whom he works so hard. Although Boston financiers have not been able to control basic industries, they own more than 10 billion US dollars in assets and several billion US dollars in personal trust funds. Most of this money is invested in companies led by the Morgan Consortium and the Rockefeller Consortium. Boston financiers and bankers have an inseparable connection with Wall Street bosses. Kennedy's talent for serving capitalists has of course also been appreciated by Wall Street financiers. In his policy speeches, Kennedy proposed a twelve-point plan to step up the arms race and prepare for war and to be hostile to China and the Soviet Union, which is in line with the wishes of monopoly capitalists. Kennedy's proposal to increase military spending by 2.5 billion to 3 billion US dollars is an act of ingratiating himself with the Rockefeller Consortium, because this was originally Nelson Rockefeller's proposal.
　　The matter is very clear. In American political life, whether Republicans or Democrats serve as the president of the United States, there is no essential difference. The final ruling power is in the hands of the American monopoly groups. Nixon or Kennedy are just agents of American monopoly capitalists. If anyone thinks that the US presidential election will produce any miracles, and that a "wise man" will emerge to lead to a change in the US's aggressive policy, that is a completely unrealistic fantasy.

    金融帝国王位之争
    乐山
    美国伟大的现实主义作家马克·吐温曾经描绘美国总统独揽行政大权的情况说：“在我们这里，不仅是君主制，而且是一个政治氏族世袭的政治君主制。我们的君主较比欧洲任何君主都更加有力、更加专制、更加独裁。他从白宫发出的命令不受法律和惯例的约束，他可以逼迫国会……他可以加强和集中中央政权，剥夺各州的权力……他可以把自己的亲信安插进最高法院。”由于总统是国家的头等重要职位，美国垄断组织从来没有放松对这个“王位”的控制。垄断组织供给竞选活动经费，是取得竞选胜利的决定性条件，所以每一届的美国总统实际上是由金融寡头通过他们所操纵的两个政党——共和党和民主党四年一度的竞选闹剧来选定的。两党的总统候选人都是由垄断资本家及其代理人——党魁——在幕后会议决定。1952年7月7日“纽约时报”报道共和党代表大会选举总统候选人说：“成百个胸前挂满了徽章、持着小旗等等在街头游荡的代表们，以为他们自己起着重要的作用。其实，所发生的一切并不是在他们参加之下、甚至常常是在他们所不知道的情况下进行的。”在历届总统选举运动中，无论是共和党或民主党，都得到了垄断资本家巨额经费的帮助，美国“基督教科学箴言报”说，在1956年的竞选中，共和党和民主党候选人的经费共达两亿美元。美国垄断资本家就是这样扶持合于他们的心意的人登上总统宝座。
    由于世界形势日益有利于社会主义和和平力量而不利于帝国主义战争力量，以美国为首的帝国主义集团内部的困难和矛盾日益增长，资本主义总危机不断深刻化，美国垄断集团中最富有侵略性和战争狂热的势力，积极图谋亲自直接掌握政权，以适应垂危的迫切形势。于是产生了洛克菲勒竞选共和党总统候选人的插曲。但是，因为洛克菲勒财团还没有能够建立绝对的垄断权力，也没有能够在政治上完全压倒其他敌对财团，因此他的亲政企图暂时还不能得心应手，因而“急流勇退”，准备在1964年下届大选中卷土重来。今年的总统宝座之争，就由美国资产阶级报刊吹捧为“青年有为”的人物尼克松与肯尼迪来进行了。
    尼克松的政治活动是在1946年他从海军服役期满回到加利福尼亚州故乡以后开始的。他在服役期间为埃尔科公司争取海军订货所显示的“才能”，使资本家颇为赏识。回到故乡以后，尼克松就在洛杉矶的财阀和帮会势力的扶持下，充当了共和党的众议员候选人。从那时候起，尼克松就打起反共旗帜，积极展开政治活动。他在1948年当上了众议员，而积极为垄断资本家效劳。他参加了塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法的起草；在马歇尔计划筹备时期，他参加了由赫脱（当时为众议员）领导的研究小组赴欧调查，返美后拼命鼓吹利用加强剥削劳动人民的手段来挽救西欧国家摇摇欲坠的资本主义秩序；他在非美活动调查委员会中大显身手，成了希斯迫害案的主要人物，与麦卡锡狼狈为奸。
    1950年尼克松在加利福尼亚房地产大资本家、石油巨子、牛奶业资本家大力支持下当选参议员。他在参议院的投票记录，最足以说明他为大老板效忠的本色。1951年6月20日，尼克松投票赞成把公共房屋从五万座削减为五千座；1952年6月4日，他投票赞成缩短房租管制时期；6月5日，他又投票主张取消联邦政府对房租的管制；6月12日，他与参议员诺兰联合提出一项旨在取消公共房屋的法案。这是尼克松为房地产大资本家效劳的一些例证。1951年8月21日，尼克松投票赞成一项有利于石油公司的法案，9月1日，他投票反对把石油开采耗竭津贴从27.5％降为14％。这是尼克松为石油垄断资本家服务的行动。为了维护牛奶业大资本家的利润，尼克松在参议院里大力反对从法国、丹麦和北大西洋侵略集团其他国家输入奶制品。
    1952年，尼克松在加利福尼亚财团和华尔街财阀共同扶持下，当选为副总统。尼克松就任副总统以后，他在参议院仍有投票权。从1953年1月就任起到1960年2月4日，尼克松共投过七次票。尽管投票次数不多，尼克松却留下了可耻的记录。例如1953年6月18日，尼克松一天两次投票赞成一项维护大企业利益、增加资本家的利润而不利于小企业的所谓防务生产法案。又如1959年4月22日，尼克松反对重新审议美国劳工所猛烈抨击的所谓“权利法”，这个法案以保护
  “工人权利”为名，禁止工会组织罢工，破坏工会活动。1960年2月4日，尼克松投票反对增加学校建筑的补助款项，这些记录都说明了尼克松是为谁服务。
    尼克松曾在钢铁劳资纠纷中充当调解人，这是垄断资本家抬高尼克松的身价、增加竞选资本的手法。据民主党全国委员会主席巴特勒揭露，尼克松秘密同意让钢铁公司于选举结束以后提高钢铁价格。
    尼克松为了投机，在过去一个时期，在鼓吹“实力政策”的同时，也侈谈和平。还到过苏联去进行过“友好”访问。但是自从美国破坏四国首脑会议以后，他就完全显露了本来的面目。尼克松最近公开宣传苏美之间的矛盾可能用战争来解决。他疯狂叫嚣扩军备战，吹嘘美国的“攻击力量”“报复力量”，仇视社会主义国家。这一切显然都是按照美国垄断资本家的意旨行事的。从纽约的“支持尼克松当选总统俱乐部”的组织成员看来，尼克松已经获得不少的华尔街金融家和企业主的支持。
    民主党总统候选人肯尼迪的政治背景丝毫不比他的对手逊色。他在民主党代表大会上发表的接受提名演说中，号召美国人成为“拓荒者”，来应付一个“新边疆”的希望和威胁，他说，新边疆“不是一连串的诺言，而是一连串的挑战。”对肯尼迪说来，“拓荒者”的提法不是偶然的。肯尼迪出自波士顿“名门”。他的父亲约瑟夫·肯尼迪是美国七十五个最大的富豪之一。波士顿的金融富豪是有名的“拓荒者”，他们率先制造侵略哲学，为美西战争、美国征服菲律宾、美国对拉丁美洲的“大棒”政策作辩护。波士顿的第一国民银行在南美和古巴建立了分行，波士顿人开办的联合果品公司掌握了对中美洲的经济和政治控制权。
    约瑟夫·肯尼迪担任过波士顿一家银行和伯利恒钢铁造船厂的经理，后来移居纽约从事投机贸易，成为大金融资本家。他从1937年到1940年出任美国驻英大使，后来因为坚决反对美国参加反希特勒法西斯战争而去职。
    肯尼迪的政治活动是在他的父亲约瑟夫·肯尼迪指导之下开始的。1940年肯尼迪在哈佛大学法学院毕业时所作的、为张伯伦辩解的毕业论文，就是在老肯尼迪协助下写出的，出版以后行销美英两国，成了肯尼迪政治生活的第一个里程碑。第二次世界大战时期，肯尼迪加入海军在远东作战，1945年退役后就在波士顿展开政治活动。他在1946年当选为众议员。“纽约邮报”最近连载的“肯尼迪传”说：“毫无疑问，老肯尼迪在幕后极力活动、牵线。他提供经费，并进行宣传和公共关系方面的工作。”1952年，肯尼迪在竞选中打败了洛奇（现任美国驻联合国代表），当选为参议员。在这次选举以后，大力吹捧肯尼迪的波士顿“邮报”从老肯尼迪那里取得了数达五十万美元的贷款。
    肯尼迪当选参议员的时期，正是参议员麦卡锡开始飞扬跋扈的日子。大家知道，麦卡锡主义力图胁迫每一种独立的意见、每一个有思想的人对它屈服。它焚毁书籍、摧残文化艺术。它企图打垮工人运动，加紧奴役黑人，掀起种族主义和反犹太主义，欺骗青年并扫除一切自由的形迹。在参议院里，当麦卡锡要求增拨他的调查委员会的经费或提出一些迫害人民的案件的时候，他大都获得了肯尼迪的赞成票。1954年，在国内外对麦卡锡主义的强烈谴责下，美国参议院通过了弹劾麦卡锡的决议。肯尼迪是反对这个弹劾案的，后来因为生病入院，才避免了投反对票的可耻记录。肯尼迪的父亲约瑟夫·肯尼迪是麦卡锡的好友，肯尼迪的哥哥罗伯·肯尼迪是麦卡锡手下的一个职员，肯尼迪自己曾经说过：“1953年，当我的哥哥还是麦卡锡的职员的时候，我个人自然不便于对麦卡锡在1951或1952年的作为有所抗议，这就是问题的实质。”
    肯尼迪是1959年反动的“肯尼迪—欧文法案”的起草人。这个法案比塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法更为反动。法案规定，劳工部长有绝对的权力可以迫使任何一个工会向他提出详细的财政收支报告和工会其他重要档案，并有权把这些文件交给资方……。“肯尼迪—欧文法案”与众议院提出的“格里芬—兰德勒姆法案”，构成了艾森豪威尔于1959年9月14日签署生效的新的反劳工法、即所谓“劳工改革法”。
    肯尼迪的这些议会记录，充分说明了他是为谁辛苦为谁忙。虽然波士顿的金融家没有能够控制基本工业，但是他们拥有一百亿美元以上的资产和几十亿美元的个人信托款，这些钱大部分投在摩根财团和洛克菲勒财团所领导的公司。波士顿的金融家、银行家与华尔街的老板有着不可分割的联系。肯尼迪的为资本家效力的才干当然也获得华尔街财阀的赏识。肯尼迪在他所发表的政策演说中，提出加紧扩军备战和与中苏为敌的十二点计划，正符合垄断资本家的心意。肯尼迪提出的增加军费二十五亿至三十亿美元的建议，是向洛克菲勒财团讨好取悦的举动，因为这本来就是纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的主张。
    事情很明白，在美国的政治生活中，不管是共和党人还是民主党人充当美国的总统，并无本质上的区别，最后统治权都掌握在美国垄断集团的手里。尼克松也好、肯尼迪也好，都不过是美国垄断资本家的代理人而已。如果有人以为美国总统选举会产生什么奇迹，会出来什么一位“明智之士”，导致美国侵略政策的改变，那完全是不切实际的幻想。（附图片）
