    The Guhe Commune Party Committee Cares for Commune Members' Lives and Takes Measures to Prevent Heatstroke and Cool Down
    Our Guhe Commune Party Committee, in order to ensure a balance of work and rest in summer production and protect the health of commune members, has adopted the following measures to prevent heatstroke and cool down: 1. Combine work and rest. The commune party committee stipulates that commune members must have a certain amount of rest time at noon every day and ensure that commune members have enough sleep. 2. Build cool sheds. More than 460 cool sheds have been built in fields that do not have forests and are far from villages for commune members to rest and shade themselves. 3. Establish tea stations. More than 700 tea stations have been established at the entrances of villages and in the fields to ensure a constant supply of boiling water. 4. Process straw hats. The commune has established a hat-making factory that uses wheat straw to process wide-brimmed straw hats, and has now made more than 880 hats. 5. Organize 16 mobile medical teams, assign areas of responsibility, and go deep into the fields and construction sites; prepare more heatstroke prevention medicines such as Rendan and Ten Drops Water, as well as cooling agents. 6. Carry out a summer hygiene work appraisal and competition, and educate commune members not to drink cold water or eat raw, cold, or rotten food.

    古河公社党委关心社员生活采取措施防暑降温
    我们古河公社党委，为了保证在夏季生产中做到有劳有逸，保护社员身体健康，特采取以下防暑降温措施：一、劳逸结合。公社党委规定夏季每天中午必须给社员一定的休息时间，并保证社员有足够的睡眠。二、搭凉棚。在没有树林并离村庄较远的田间，搭凉棚四百六十多处，供社员休息蔽荫。三、设立茶水站。全社在村头、田间设立茶水站七百多处，保证经常有开水供应。四、加工草帽。公社成立制帽厂，利用麦秸等加工宽边草帽，现已制帽子八百八十多顶。五、组织巡回医疗小组十六个，分片包干，深入田间工地；多备人丹、十滴水等防暑药品和清凉剂。六、开展夏季卫生工作大评比竞赛，教育社员不喝冷水，不吃生冷和腐烂食物。
