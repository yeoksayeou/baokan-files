　　A Glimpse of Silesia
　　Silesia is the pride of Poland. The Silesian Song and Dance Ensemble, as famous as the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, is known throughout the country for its magnificent momentum and fascinating performances. Silesia's national costumes are even more distinctive, with miners wearing large hats with feathers, and girls wearing bright and ornate clothes. However, Silesia is primarily known for its "black gold" and industry, and it has always been called the "boiler room of Europe" and the "industrial heart of Poland."
　　After visiting Silesia for a few days, we were deeply impressed by the magnificent appearance of the Silesian industrial area. The dozens of kilometers centered on Katowice form a huge industrial center. Katowice, Sosnowiec, Bytom, Chorzów, Zabrze, Tarnowskie Góry, and a dozen other cities are completely connected, making it the most prosperous and densely populated area in the country. Trams connect the cities. Apart from the street signs indicating the names of the cities, it is difficult for newcomers to realize that they have moved from one city to another. Sometimes the boundary markers between two cities are just a bridge or a street. In fact, it can be said that the Silesian industrial area is a huge unified city. As the cities of Silesia are connected due to the development of construction projects, the coal mines that were originally located in the suburbs of the cities have now become like they are located in the center of the city, and the miners seem to be mining right next to the streets in the city center. This gives every visiting visitor a novel impression.
　　Standing on a high-rise building in Katowice and looking into the distance, everywhere are the mine hoists and the tall chimneys of factories. Huge factories are shrouded in the smoke spewing from the chimneys, including the famous "Peace" Metallurgical Plant and many machine tool and machine manufacturing plants. Eighty-one of the country's eighty-seven coal mines are concentrated in Silesia. Silesia provides the country with more than 1.5 million tons of steel annually and produces the vast majority of coal. Silesia is also a famous producer of iron and zinc in Poland.
　　Above and below ground, Silesia is boiling with life day and night, full of intense labor. Elevated trains carrying steel, coal, and building materials rumble through the city from time to time, and the streets are bustling with traffic, showing the tension and excitement that is unique to a large industrial area.

　　An Underground Tour of Katowice
　　While in Katowice, we visited the Polish Ministry of Coal Mining Industry. The Polish Ministry of Coal Mining Industry moved from the capital to Katowice, the center of coal production, long ago. We met a miner named Kemba in the corridor of the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry. When we asked him where he worked, he humorously but seriously said: "I am digging at the base of the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry, working right under this building." His answer was surprising at first, but we later learned that the underground of Katowice, Bytom, and Sosnowiec is a coal mining area, and many miners mine under their own houses. This is a very interesting phenomenon. Underground, in the same area where steelworkers and machine manufacturing workers are working hard, coal miners are competing with them, conducting a tense battle to seize coal. In order to understand the underground life of Katowice, we visited the "Ujek" mine, accompanied by a technical inspector from the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry. This mine is located in the city of Katowice, and its miners mine under Katowice.
　　Going down to the mine four hundred to eight hundred meters deep, we saw crisscrossing tunnels. The main tunnels were equipped with strong fluorescent lights, and trains carrying coal mining equipment and coal blocks sped by. Teams of coal miners carrying miner's lamps were heading to the coal mining site to change shifts. According to the technical inspector and the director of the "Ujek" mine who accompanied us on the tour: "200,000 people in Silesia work underground every day, and underground is as bustling with intense labor as it is above ground." We asked: "Will mining under large cities and large factories cause a risk of collapse?" According to them: Coal mining here is done by layered mining, and after each layer is mined, it is immediately filled with mud and sand, which generally does not cause danger. However, in order to avoid accidents, aircraft with strong impact force are not allowed to land and take off in this area. Therefore, the nearest airport to Katowice is seventy or eighty kilometers away. Scholars are continuing to study this issue.
　　"Ujek" is one of the older but highly mechanized mines in Silesia. Coal mining and transportation are all done by machines. There are more than 5,000 miners, and they mine more than 6,300 tons of coal every day and night. We walked about ten kilometers in the mine, stopping from time to time to watch or listen to the owners explain many things in the mine. According to the technical inspector of the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry and the director of the "Ujek" mine: The coal mining industry in Silesia has developed greatly in recent years. This year, 28% of the coal mining process in the entire region has been mechanized, and many mines have achieved full mechanization and automation. The entire region is also widely promoting hydraulic coal mining, and this year the entire Silesia hydraulic coal mining can reach 1.4 million tons. This greatly improves labor productivity and reduces the labor of miners. Mine director Vulanqishikote specifically took us to the coal mining tunnel to watch the coal mining situation of the combined coal mining machine and how the conveyor belt automatically transports the coal to the loading yard. When we walked through the tunnels and coal mining sites, we met many miners who were working hard and happily. They all asked reporters to convey the greetings of Polish miners to the Chinese miner brothers.
　　We spent the whole afternoon in the mine. When we came out of the mine, dusk had shrouded the whole city.

　　An Energetic Old Miner
　　While in Katowice, we visited an old miner named Vulaodaqike. He is a tunnel excavator at the "Ujek" mine and has spent thirty-four years underground. The Silesian mining area has a history of more than 100 years. Many families have worked in the mines for generations. Among the more than 300,000 miners in Silesia today, there are many mining families with three generations. Vulaodaqike belongs to a family of miners. His father and brother are both miners. He could have retired and enjoyed his old age by receiving a generous pension since last year. But he refused. He does not accept that he is old and still works underground with the young and middle-aged people, and he completes and overfulfills his production plan every day. He won the title of Advanced Worker last year and became a pacesetter in the mine. What kind of power is encouraging his enthusiasm and enabling him to work with vigorous energy at the age of sixty? When we asked him, he did not answer our questions, but narrated the tragic experiences of miners under the oppression of capitalists in the past. We have seen photos and paintings recording the tragic lives of miners in the past in the Polish Ministry of Coal Mining Industry, but this record of tragic life is clearer in the memory of old miners than anywhere else. He is a witness to the changes in the life of miners. The people's government has changed his life. He is grateful to the people's government and grateful to the Party. In his opinion, when the country needs coal, how can he, as the master of the country, retire! He explained that he loves his profession and that labor makes his life meaningful. From the simple words he spoke, we saw the spiritual outlook of the Silesian miners. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party proposed the slogan of technological progress, Vulaodaqikes in Silesia were all involved in the upsurge of technological innovation to further improve coal mining production.

　　The First Socialist Labor Team
　　On our last day in Silesia, we visited Poland's first socialist labor team, the Kowalski labor team of the Kaleda Paper Mill. The working class in Silesia has a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Dombrowski district has been famous as a red area for decades. Silesian workers are also shock troops in socialist construction. At present, there are more than 9,000 labor teams in Poland participating in production competitions, most of which are concentrated in the industrial area of Silesia, and the title of the first socialist labor team was also won by the workers of Silesia - the Kowalski labor team.
　　The Kaleda Paper Mill is 60 kilometers from Katowice. Our car made many detours on the road before finding it in a dense jungle. The factory manager said as soon as we met: "Welcome, our factory has the closest relationship with China, because China is the motherland of Cai Lun, the ancestor of papermaking." The factory director and chief engineer enthusiastically introduced the situation of the entire factory to us and took us to visit the factory. When we entered the industrial paper production workshop, a striking red flag immediately attracted our attention. The chief engineer said that this red flag team is the Kowalski Socialist Labor Team.
　　The Kowalski Labor Team is a small but very united collective. This labor team has only ten people in total, with an average age of only 20 years old. It is the youngest and most energetic labor team in the factory. They are responsible for sewing paper bags for cement packaging. Since participating in the national competition for the title of Socialist Labor Team at the beginning of last year, they have overfulfilled the plan by 30% to 45% every month. There is an old bag sewing machine in the workshop that every labor team is unwilling to use. After trying it out, each team said that sewing 15,000 paper bags within eight hours per shift is the most they can do. Kowalski said: "Let's try it!" They adjusted the production organization, improved the operation process, and immediately increased the number of paper bags sewn per shift from 15,000 to 27,000. Later, they also researched and modified the machine parts, accelerated the machine's operating speed, and increased labor productivity by another 10%. This team not only produces with a socialist attitude, but they have also set an example for the entire factory in carrying out political and business studies. They actively participate in the factory's political studies and after-school schools, and help each other improve their business proficiency, so that everyone has become multi-skilled, and everyone can replace the work of anyone else in the team. Each member of the Kowalski Labor Team takes on social work: members of the Party branch, secretaries of the Socialist Youth League branch, chairmen and members of the trade union, medical service personnel of the Red Cross, etc., and have become powerful assistants to the factory and the Party. Because they produce, study and work in accordance with the socialist attitude, in March of this year, this labor team won the title of the first socialist labor team in the country and became the banner of the national competition movement.
　　When we went to visit, Kowalski said that they are preparing to modify the machine separately to make it fully automated, and they will also overproduce 100,000 paper bags in the short term. When the team members were talking with us, they unanimously stated that they would hold high the glorious banner of the socialist labor team and become a labor team that never stagnates and continues to move forward.

　　西里西亚纪行
　　本报记者　李克
    西里西亚一瞥
    西里西亚是波兰人的骄傲。和玛佐夫舍歌舞团齐名的西里西亚歌舞团以其磅礴气势、引人入胜的演出著名全国。西里西亚的民族服装更加富有地方色彩，矿工们戴着插有羽毛的大帽，姑娘们穿着鲜艳而饰以文采的衣裳。但是，西里西亚的著名首先是因为它的“黑金”和工业，它一向被称为“欧洲的锅炉房”和“波兰工业的心脏”。
    我们在西里西亚参观了几天之后，西里西亚大工业区宏伟的面貌留给了我们深刻的印象。以卡托维茨为中心的几十公里的地区组成一个巨大的工业中心区。卡托维茨、索诺维茨、比托姆、霍若夫、扎布热、塔尔诺夫斯基山等十几个城市完全联成一片，成为全国最繁华、人口最密集的地区，各城市之间有电车相通，除了指路牌上标明各个城市的名称外，对于初来的参观者来说，很难发现你已经从一个城市迈进另一个城市，有时两个城市的界标只是一座桥或者是一条街。事实上可以说，西里西亚的工业区是一个巨大的统一的城市。由于西里西亚各城市随着建设事业的发展联成一片，原先设在各城市郊区的煤矿矿井现在已变成好像就设在城市的中心，矿工们好像就在市中心的街道旁边开矿。这给每个远来的参观者以新奇的印象。
    登上卡托维茨高层建筑远眺，视野之内，到处是矿井的绞车和工厂高大林立的烟囱。一座座巨型的工厂笼罩在烟囱喷出的烟阵中，其中有著名的“和平”冶金厂以及许多车床和机器制造厂。全国八十七个煤井中有八十一个集中在西里西亚。西里西亚每年向国家提供一百五十多万吨钢，生产着绝大部分的煤。西里西亚也是波兰铁和锌的著名产地。
    西里西亚地上地下日夜沸腾着生活，充满着紧张的劳动。运送钢铁、煤和建筑材料的高架火车不时在城市上空轰隆滚过，街道上车水马龙，显示着大工业区所特有的紧张和热闹的情景。
      卡托维茨地下巡礼
    我们在卡托维茨时访问了波兰煤矿工业部。波兰煤矿工业部很早就从首都迁来产煤中心的卡托维茨。我们在煤矿工业部的走廊里碰到一位名叫肯巴的矿工，当我们问他在哪里工作时，他幽默地但却是认真地说：“我在挖煤矿工业部的墙角，就在这座房子的地底下工作。”他的回答最初曾使人惊异，但我们随后就问清楚了，原来卡托维茨、比托姆、索诺维茨这些大城市的地下就是采煤区，许多矿工就在他们自己住的房子下面采煤。这是十分有趣的现象，就在炼钢工人和机器制造工人紧张劳动的地方的地底下，煤矿工人在和他们竞赛，进行着紧张的夺煤的战斗。为了了解卡托维茨地底的生活，我们在煤矿工业部一位技术检查员陪同下，参观了“乌也克”矿井，这座矿井就在卡托维茨市里，它的矿工们就在卡托维茨地底下采煤。
    下到四百米到八百米深的井下，只见巷道纵横，主要巷道里安装着强烈的日光灯，一列列载运采煤器材和煤块的小火车奔驰而过，一队队提着矿灯的采煤工人正分头到采煤场去换班。据陪我们参观的技术检查员和“乌也克”矿矿长说：“西里西亚每天有二十万人在地底下工作，井下和地上一样沸腾着紧张的劳动生活。”我们问：“你们在大城市和大工厂的底下采煤，不会引起崩塌的危险吗？”据他们说：这里采煤是用分层采的办法，每采过一层后立即用泥沙填充起来，一般不致发生危险，但为了避免发生意外，不准冲击力很强的飞机在这一地区降落和起飞，因此，距卡托维茨最近的飞机场也有七八十公里。学者们正继续研究这一问题。
    “乌也克”是西里西亚较老的但却是机械化程度很高的矿井之一，采煤以及运输全部使用机器。有五千多名矿工，每昼夜采煤六千三百多吨。这个矿的煤层很厚，最厚处有两米。我们在矿里来往走了大约有十几公里，不时停下来观看或者听主人们解释矿井里的许多事情。据煤矿工业部技术检查员和“乌也克”矿长说：西里西亚的采煤工业近几年有了很大发展，今年全区的矿井已有28％的采煤过程机械化，不少矿井已做到全盘机械化和自动化。全区也在广泛推广水力采煤，今年整个西里西亚水力采煤可达一百四十万吨。这大大提高了劳动生产率和减轻了矿工们的劳动，矿长伏兰奇什科特意带我们到采煤巷道，观看了联合采煤机采煤情况和传送带如何自动地把煤运到装车场。我们走过巷道和采煤场时碰到许多矿工在紧张愉快的劳动，他们都纷纷请记者向中国矿工兄弟转致波兰矿工们的问候。
    我们在矿井中耽搁了整个下午，从矿井出来时，暮色已笼罩着全城。
    老当益壮一矿工
    我们在卡托维茨时访问了一位名叫伏劳达奇科的老矿工，他是“乌也克”矿上的巷道掘进工，在地底下度过了三十四年。西里西亚矿区已有一百多年的历史，许多家庭曾世代在矿井工作，现在西里西亚三十多万矿工中，一门三代的矿工世家大有人在，伏劳达奇科就属于出身于矿工世家的人，他的父亲和弟弟都是矿工。从前年起他本来就可以靠领取丰厚的养老金度过晚年。但他不肯，他并不服老，仍然和青壮年一起在井下劳动，而且天天完成和超额完成生产计划。他去年获得了先进工人称号，成了矿上的标兵。是什么力量在鼓舞着他的干劲，使他在六十岁的高龄仍以旺盛的精力进行工作？当我们问他时，他没有回答我们的问题，却叙述了过去矿工在资本家压迫下的悲惨遭遇。我们在波兰煤矿工业部里看到过记录着过去矿工悲惨生活的照片和绘画，但这种悲惨生活的记录，在老年矿工的记忆里比任何地方都清晰。他是矿工生活变迁的见证人，人民政权改变了他的生活，他感激人民政权、感激党，在他看来，当国家需要煤的时候，他作为国家的主人，怎么能退休呢！他解释说：他热爱自己的职业，劳动使他的生活才有意义。从他用朴素的语言讲出的话中，我们看到了西里西亚矿工的精神面貌。波兰统一工人党四中全会提出技术进步的口号之后，西里西亚的伏劳达奇科们都卷入了革新技术的热潮中，要把采煤生产更加提高一步。
    第一个社会主义劳动队
    我们在西里西亚的最后一天访问了波兰的第一个社会主义劳动队——卡列达城造纸厂的科瓦尔斯基劳动队。西里西亚的工人阶级具有光荣的革命传统，董布罗夫斯基区几十年前就以红色的区域著名。西里西亚工人还是社会主义建设的突击手。现在波兰共有九千多个劳动队在进行生产竞赛，其中大部分集中在西里西亚的工业区，而第一个社会主义劳动队的称号也为西里西亚的工人——科瓦尔斯基劳动队所获得。
    卡列达造纸厂距卡托维茨六十公里，我们的汽车在公路上绕了不少圈子，才在一座茂密的丛林中找到它。工厂经理一见面就说：“欢迎你们，我们工厂同中国关系最密切，因为中国是造纸的祖先蔡伦的祖国。”厂长和总工程师向我们热情地介绍了全厂情况并带我们参观了工厂。当我们走进工业用纸生产车间时，一面醒目的红旗立刻引起了我们的注意，总工程师说，这个红旗队就是科瓦尔斯基的社会主义劳动队。
    科瓦尔斯基劳动队是个不大的但却团结得很好的集体。这个劳动队一共只有十人，平均年龄只有二十岁，是这个工厂最年轻也最富有朝气的劳动队。他们担任缝制装水泥用的纸袋的生产任务，从去年年初参加全国争取社会主义劳动队称号竞赛运动以来，每月都超额完成计划的30％到45％。车间里有一台老旧的缝袋机，各个劳动队都不愿意使用，各个队在试用过之后都说，每班八小时内缝制一万五千个纸袋，不能再多了。科瓦尔斯基说：“让我们来试试吧！”他们调整了生产组织，改进了操作过程，一下子就把每班缝制的纸袋数从一万五千个提高到二万七千个。后来，他们又研究修改了机器零件，加速了机器运转速度，又把劳动生产率提高了10％。这个队不仅以社会主义态度进行生产，他们在大搞政治业务学习方面也为全厂做出了表率。他们积极参加工厂的政治学习和业余学校，互相帮助提高业务熟练水平，使得每个人都成了多面手，每个人都可以代替本队其它任何人的工作。科瓦尔斯基劳动队每个成员都担任着社会工作：党支部委员、社会主义青年联盟支部书记、工会主席和委员、红十字会的医疗服务员等等，成了工厂和党的有力助手。由于他们按照社会主义的态度生产、学习和工作，今年3月，这个劳动队获得了全国第一个社会主义劳动队的称号，成了全国竞赛运动的旗帜。
    当我们去访问时，科瓦尔斯基说：他们正准备把机器另行改装，使它完全自动化，他们还要在短期内超额生产十万个纸袋。队员们在和我们在谈话时一致表示，他们要高举社会主义劳动队的光荣旗帜，成为永不停滞、不断前进的劳动队。（附图片）
