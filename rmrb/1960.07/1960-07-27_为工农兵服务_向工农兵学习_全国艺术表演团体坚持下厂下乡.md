Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch: In recent years, over three thousand three hundred national artistic performance groups have further implemented the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist cause, achieving great harvests in both ideology and art.

Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist cause has always been the only correct path followed by the Party's literary and art workers. Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, this policy has been further implemented. Throughout the country, all state-run and folk professional art troupes have universally launched an upsurge of going to the mountains, the countryside, factories and mines, and companies, "bringing good shows to the doorstep," to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, the 206 art troupes in Henan Province performed for workers, peasants, and soldiers in 1958 and 1959, with the number of performances and audience members far exceeding the total number of performances and audience members in the previous eight years. In Sichuan Province, 135 Sichuan Opera troupes performed in the mountains, countryside, factories and mines in 1958, accounting for 42.65% of the total number of performances for the year, and workers, peasants, and soldiers accounted for 55.31% of the total audience. In many provinces and autonomous regions such as Hebei, Shanxi, Ningxia, Hunan, and Gansu, the special and county troupes spend 70% to 80% of their time each year performing for workers and peasants in rural areas and factories and mines. The Ningshuo Qin Opera Troupe of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has spent more than 85% of its time in the past three years going to the mountains and the countryside, bringing performances to the fields, construction sites, mines, and other places. Regardless of the height of the mountains or the distance of the road, they go wherever the masses need them to perform. The Pingshun Farmer Troupe in Shanxi Province has traveled to all the villages in the county. Sometimes they carry their luggage and props themselves, bringing performances to the families on the top of the mountains, allowing the farmers in the mountainous areas to joyfully enjoy the opera. Not only are the special and county troupes doing this, but art troupes in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have also made going to factories and the countryside an important task in the past two years. Many theaters in Beijing arrange for one-third of their performances during the year to be delivered to the doorsteps of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the city, and one-third of the performances are touring performances to bring performances to the vast masses in remote areas. Last summer, more than 40 art performance groups in Shanghai successively went to the rural suburbs to conduct large-scale touring performances for farmers to celebrate the summer harvest. Just after returning from the countryside, the actors braved the summer heat and went to various steel mills to give consolation performances to the steelmaking heroes who were "fighting high temperatures and seizing high yields." The actors of the Wuhan Opera House have traveled to more than 50 counties in the province. Many art performance groups in various provinces and cities also constantly send good shows to the Fujian front lines to give wonderful performances for the heroic commanders and fighters defending the motherland.

In recent years, many famous actors have set good examples in serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, Mei Lanfang, a famous Peking Opera actor, is already over sixty years old, but he still tries his best to go to factories, mines, rural areas, and troops to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and even goes down to the mines to give consolation performances. Another example is Zhou Xinfang, a Peking Opera actor in his sixties, who spent half a year in 1958 touring 14 cities in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sichuan provinces, performing more than 190 shows.

The actors and staff of various art performance groups conscientiously learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are determined to become literary and art workers who are both red and expert. While performing in the mountains, the countryside, factories and mines, and companies, they also universally participate in labor training and consciously carry out ideological transformation. Many actors also live, eat, and work with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The actors of many troupes in Sichuan Province have also learned production techniques and knowledge such as plowing, rice transplanting, and fertilizer accumulation during their performances in the mountains and the countryside. The members of the Cultural Troupe of the Tibet Military Region not only went deep into the deep mountains and forests to perform for the troops searching the mountains and suppressing bandits, but also controlled the high ground together with the soldiers in the battles to quell the rebellion, severely hitting the enemy. After the successive political movements and the past few years of going to the mountains, the countryside, factories and mines, and companies, the actors and staff of art performance groups in various places have further connected with reality, went deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and gradually changed their ideological feelings. Their labor concepts and mass viewpoints have been universally strengthened, and their political awareness has been increasing day by day.

The performances of art performance groups in various places in the mountains, the countryside, factories and mines, and companies have absorbed artistic nourishment from the rich and colorful sources of life, and have also achieved fruitful results in performing arts and script creation. For example, when the Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe performed for the workers and peasants in northern Jiangsu, the actor Wu Xiaofeng learned a section of the folk tune "Planting Barley," which was more beautiful than her original singing in terms of rhythm and emotion. The Liuyang Flower Drum Opera Troupe in Hunan Province went deep into life and learned from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, improving the performance level of modern dramas and enriching the performing arts of the opera. At the same time, the actors, playwrights, directors, etc. of various troupes created and staged many high-quality modern dramas that reflected the face of the Great Leap Forward era, praised new things, and expressed the workers, peasants, and soldiers in a timely manner while going deep into life. The drama workers in Shanghai went to factories and neighborhoods, performing and working at the same time. In the two months of this year, they created and staged more than 50 new dramas reflecting the technological revolution and the communization of cities. Each script truly expresses the workers' daring to think and daring to act communist style, and has been unanimously praised by the worker audiences. In the past two years, many excellent modern dramas staged in various places, such as the Henan Opera "Winter Goes, Spring Comes" and the drama "Subduing Dragons and Taming Tigers," have been created by authors who have gone deep into life and combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    为工农兵服务　向工农兵学习
    全国艺术表演团体坚持下厂下乡
    新华社26日讯　近几年来，全国三千三百多个艺术表演团体进一步贯彻文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方针，在思想和艺术上都获得了大丰收。
    为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方针，一直是党的文艺工作者所遵循的唯一正确的道路。1958年以来，在总路线光辉照耀下，这一方针更进一步得到了贯彻。全国范围内，所有国营和民间职业艺术团体，普遍掀起了上山、下乡、下厂矿、下连队、“把好戏送上门”，更好地为工农兵服务的热潮。如河南省二百零六个艺术团体在1958、1959两年中，为工农兵演出场次、观众人数，远远超过以往八年演出场数和观众人数的总和。四川全省一百三十五个川剧团，1958年一年内上山、下乡、下厂矿演出场次，占全年演出总场数的42.65％，工农兵观众占总观众人次的55.31％。河北、山西、宁夏、湖南、甘肃等许多省、自治区的专、县剧团，每年70％至80％的时间都是在农村、厂矿，为工农群众演出。宁夏回族自治区宁朔秦剧团三年来有85％以上的时间是上山、下乡，把戏送到田间、工地、矿山等地方。不管山高路远，哪里群众需要，他们就到哪里演出。山西省平顺农民剧团已跑遍全县所有的村庄，有时他们自己背着行李、道具，把戏送给山顶上的人家，使山区农民欢乐地欣赏戏曲。不仅专、县剧团如此，北京、上海、武汉等大城市的艺术团体近两年来也都把下厂、下乡演出，做为一项重要任务。北京许多剧院做到在一年中演出的三分之一的场次，是用送上门的办法为本市的工农兵观众演出，三分之一的场次是到外地巡回演出，把戏送给边远地区的广大群众。去年夏天，上海市四十多个艺术表演团体都陆续到市郊农村为农民作规模盛大的巡回演出，庆祝夏季丰收。刚从农村回来，演员们又冒着炎夏酷暑，到各钢铁厂向“战高温、夺高产”的炼钢英雄们进行慰问演出。武汉市歌剧院的演员们，足迹已遍及省内五十多个县。各省市许多艺术表演团体还不断把好戏送到福建前线，为捍卫祖国的英勇指战员们作精彩演出。
    几年来，许多著名演员在为工农兵服务方面作出了好的榜样。如京剧著名演员梅兰芳已是六十多岁了，他仍然尽可能深入厂矿、农村、部队为工农兵演出，甚至还下到矿井作慰问演唱。又如六十多岁的京剧演员周信芳，在1958年曾以半年时间到甘肃、陕西、山西、四川等省的十四个城市巡回演出一百九十多场。
    各艺术表演团体的演员和工作人员都认真向工农兵学习，立志做又红又专的文艺工作者。他们在上山、下乡、下厂矿、下连队演出的同时，还普遍参加劳动锻炼，自觉地进行思想改造。许多演员还做到与工农兵同吃、同住、同劳动。四川省许多剧团的演员们，在上山下乡演出中，还学会了犁田、栽秧、积肥等生产技术和生产知识。西藏军区文工团员们，不仅深入到深山丛林中去为搜山剿匪部队演出，而且在平叛战斗中，和战士们一道，控制着制高点，狠狠地打击着敌人。各地艺术表演团体的演员们和工作人员，经过历次政治运动以及这几年来的上山下乡、下厂矿、下连队，进一步联系实际，深入工农兵群众，在思想感情上逐渐发生了变化，劳动观点和群众观点普遍加强，政治觉悟日益提高。
    各地艺术表演团体上山、下乡、下厂矿、下连队演出，从丰富多彩的生活泉源中吸取艺术养料，在表演艺术和剧本创作方面也都获得了丰收。如上海人民淮剧团在苏北为工农群众演出时，演员武筱凤学习了民间曲调“种大麦”中的一段唱腔，无论节奏上感情上都比她原来的唱腔优美。湖南浏阳花鼓戏剧团深入生活，向工农群众学习，提高了现代戏的演出水平，丰富了戏曲的表演艺术。同时，各剧团的演员、编剧、导演等在深入生活中，及时创作和上演了许多质量较高的反映大跃进时代面貌、歌颂新生事物、表现工农兵的现代剧目。上海市的戏剧工作者下厂、下里弄，边演出，边劳动，在今年两个多月的时间里，就创作并上演了反映技术革命、城市公社化的新剧目五十多个。每个剧本真实地表现了工人们敢想敢干的共产主义风格，受到工人观众的一致好评。近两年来，各地上演的许多优秀现代剧目，如豫剧“冬去春来”、话剧“降龙伏虎”等作品，都是由于作者深入生活，与工农群众相结合而创造出来的。
