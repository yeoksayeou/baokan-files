The workers of the Twenty-Third Regiment Farm in the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps are building a new type of garden farm on the Junggar Basin. Now, over 200,000 mu of cultivated land is neatly divided into rectangular plots; the periphery of the plots and both sides of highways and avenues are covered with lush trees, forming a network of shelterbelts like green walls, protecting various crops. Since the farm was established in 1953, the planting area has increased from the original 43,000 mu to more than 280,000 mu, expanding nearly six times; in 1959, the total output of grain and cotton both increased by more than four times compared to 1953.

The forestry construction of this farm is an important link in ensuring the stable improvement of agricultural yield per unit area. From the first year of its establishment, the farm carried out large-scale forestry construction, adopting the method of planting trees while reclaiming wasteland, and continuously launched rapid afforestation movements such as "transplanting large trees to provide shade in the same year." Now the farm has created more than 13,000 mu of windbreak and field-protection forests, timber forests, highway forests, and scenic forests, accounting for about one-twentieth of the total cultivated land area. At present, the old reclamation area is covered with lush trees, arranged in rows horizontally and vertically, forming a "garden farm." Due to the climate regulation and wind and sand control brought about by afforestation, the yield per unit area of crops has been steadily improved year by year. In the past, about 30% of the corn was broken by wind every year, and a large amount of wheat was lodged after strong winds, coupled with the impact of hot wind, resulting in low yields. Since the formation of shelterbelts in 1956, these phenomena have been eliminated. According to surveys, in the past three years, the yield per unit area of wheat in the old reclamation area has remained stable at over 300 jin, and corn has reached more than 500 jin.

With the development of agriculture and forestry, the farm's animal husbandry production has greatly increased. The number of sheep has increased from the original 7,000 to more than 17,000, cattle from more than 300 to more than 1,000, pigs from 400 to 10,000, as well as a large number of poultry. Because agriculture provides sufficient feed for livestock, especially because the network of shelterbelts has opened up cooling grounds for livestock to graze on the plains in summer, animal husbandry production has entered a new stage of fixed grazing in the reclamation area from the past seasonal nomadic management. This not only ensures the stable development of livestock and avoids natural disasters such as wind and snow caused by long-distance transfer, but also accumulates a large amount of high-quality fertilizer on the spot for the reclamation area. At present, the high-quality fertilizer provided by the livestock in the reclamation area for agriculture every year can reach an average of 2,500 jin per mu based on the fertilization area.

The farm's industrial and sideline production is also built according to the needs of agricultural production and in order to increase the commodity portion of agricultural and animal husbandry products. Up to now, the farm has established ginning, starch, machinery repair, food processing, and other industrial and sideline production. All the cotton produced by the farm can be completely processed by itself, and cotton linters, peach cotton, etc. are also used to weave cloth bags, make cotton batting nets, degreased cotton, etc. The farm's land is originally very suitable for large-scale planting of potatoes, but in the past, due to the inability to process them in large quantities in a timely manner, they could not be planted in large quantities. This year, the farm built a starch factory with a daily processing capacity of 500 tons of potatoes, so the expanded planting area of potatoes has increased by more than double compared to last year, making the land rationally utilized. At the same time, the development of industry and sideline production has greatly accelerated the farm's capital turnover. Last year, the farm's capital turnover rate increased from 0.8 in 1958 to 1.6, doubling, fundamentally changing the past situation of borrowing from banks, and showing a new situation in which it began to hand over 1960 profits in the first quarter of this year, thereby providing sufficient funds for agricultural development. In this way, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and industry are closely combined and complement each other. Over the years, the farm has accumulated a profit of more than 7.5 million yuan to the state.

In order to adapt to agriculture as the main focus and comprehensively develop forestry, animal husbandry, industry, and sideline production, the farm has also continuously improved its organizational form of management. Gradually changed from "centralized management, single operation" to "comprehensive operation, unified management," making the combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production closer. For example, after the shelterbelts basically became forests, the professional forestry management team was disbanded and distributed to the agricultural team. With the development of livestock herds, they were also distributed to the agricultural team for management. In this way, from the regiment to the branch farm to the basic production team, comprehensive operations were carried out on a large scale, and the enthusiasm for production in all aspects was universally brought into play.

This year, the farm's various productions have achieved great development. Now, more than 160,000 mu of spring sowing plans have been overfulfilled, expanding by about 25% compared to last year, and the 80,000 mu of winter wheat has basically eliminated the third-class seedlings, growing better than in previous years. In terms of forestry, this spring afforestation reached 4,770 mu, also overfulfilling the plan. The development of pigs and chickens will also increase by three to five times compared to last year.

In March of this year, when Wang Zhen, Minister of the Central Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, came to inspect, he highly praised their achievements and awarded them the title of "Model Farm."

    准噶尔盆地建起花园农场
    绿树成荫林带成网　农林牧副全面兴旺
    本报讯　新疆生产建设兵团石河子垦区二十三团农场的职工，正在准噶尔盆地上建设一个新型的花园农场。现在二十多万亩耕地被整齐划一地分为块块长方形的条田；条田四周和公路、大道两旁林木茏葱，林带成网，像一道道的绿色围墙，把各种农作物维护起来。这个农场从1953年建场至今，种植面积由原来的四万三千亩增加到二十八万多亩，扩大了将近六倍；1959年粮食和棉花总产量都比1953年增加了四倍以上。
    这个农场的林业建设是保证农业单位产量稳定提高的重要一环。从建场的第一年开始，农场就进行了大规模的林业建设，采取边开荒边植树的办法，不断开展了“大树移植，当年成荫”等快速造林运动。现在全场已营造成防风护田林、用材林、公路林、风景林等一万三千多亩，约占总耕地面积的二十分之一。目前老垦区已是林木茏葱，横看成列，纵看成行，形成一座“花园农场”。由于造林调节气候，控制风沙，农作物的单位面积产量逐年得到稳定提高。过去每年受风折损的玉米约30％左右，小麦在大风过后大量倒伏，加以热风影响产量不高。从1956年林带成网后，这些现象消灭了。据调查近三年来，老垦区小麦单位面积产量，一直都稳定在三百斤以上，玉米达到五百多斤。
    随着农业和林业的发展，农场的畜牧业生产有了很大增长。羊已由原来的七千多只增加到一万七千多只，牛由原来的三百多头增加到一千多头，猪由四百口发展到一万口，以及大批家禽。由于农业为牲畜提供了充足的饲料，特别是因为林带成网，为牲畜夏季在平原放牧开辟了乘凉园地，因而使畜牧业生产由过去的四季游牧经营进入到在垦区定牧的新阶段。这样即保证了牲畜的稳定发展，避免了长途转移所造成的风雪等自然灾害，并且还为垦区就地积造了大量优质肥料。目前垦区的牲畜每年为农业提供的优质肥料，按施肥面积平均每亩可达两千五百斤。
    农场的工、副业生产也是根据农业生产的需要和为了增加农牧产品的商品部分而建设起来的。截至目前，这个农场已建立起轧花、淀粉、机具修理、食品加工等项工、副业生产，农场生产的全部棉花可以完全自己加工，同时还利用了棉籽短绒、剥桃棉等编织布袋、制作棉絮网套、脱脂棉等。农场的土地本来很适宜大量种植洋芋，但过去由于不能大量的及时加工处理，一直不能大量种植，今年农场建成了日处理五百吨洋芋的淀粉厂，因而洋芋的扩种面积比去年增加了一倍多，使土地得到了合理利用。同时工、副业的发展大大加快了农场的资金周转，去年农场资金周转率由1958年的零点八提高到一点六，加快了一倍，根本改变了过去向银行贷款的状况，并且出现了今年第一季度就开始上交1960年利润的新局面，从而为发展农业提供了充足的资金。这样农、林、牧、副、工业紧密结合相辅相成，几年来农场累计上交给国家的利润额达七百五十多万元。
    为了适应以农为主，全面发展林、牧、工、副业生产，农场在经营管理的组织形式上也不断进行了改进。逐步由“集中管理，单一经营”改为“综合经营，统一管理”，使农、林、牧、副结合的更紧，例如在林带基本成林后，即将专业林管队解散发给农业队，随着畜群的发展也分到农业队经营，这样从团场到分场到基层生产队，都大搞综合经营，各方面的生产积极性普遍得到了发挥。
    今年这个农场的各项生产又取得了很大的发展。现在十六万多亩的春播计划已经超额完成，比去年扩大了25％左右，八万亩冬麦基本上已经消灭了三类苗，生长胜过往年。林业方面，今年春季造林即达四千七百七十亩，也超额完成了计划。猪、鸡的发展也将比去年增加三倍到五倍以上。
    今年3月，中央农垦部王震部长来视察时，非常称赞他们的成就，并授予“标兵农场”的称号。
