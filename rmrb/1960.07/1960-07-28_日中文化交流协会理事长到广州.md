    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Kenzo Nakajima, his wife, and accompanying personnel, including Goho Shirato, arrived in Guangzhou on the 26th by train via Shenzhen. Yang Chunsong, a member of the Council of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, went to Shenzhen to greet them. Du Guoxiang, President of the Guangzhou Branch of the Foreign Cultural Association, and Vice Presidents Xu Chongqing and Sun Leyi, went to the station to welcome the Japanese friends.

    That evening, the Guangzhou Branch of the Foreign Cultural Association held a welcome banquet.

    Du Guoxiang delivered a speech at the banquet, welcoming the Japanese friends. He praised the great victory achieved by the Japanese people in their just and patriotic struggle against the United States. In his speech, Kenzo Nakajima pointed out that the preliminary victory already achieved by the Japanese people in their just and patriotic anti-American struggle will surely take root, develop, and grow stronger. Nakajima said that the hope of the Japanese people is to establish a completely independent country, but Japan is currently in a position of being subordinate to the United States, and the Japanese people are unwilling to accept this situation. Therefore, the Japanese people are increasingly widely participating in the just and patriotic anti-American struggle against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. He said, "We understand that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is directed against China and the socialist camp, and the Japanese people firmly oppose this conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries." He said, "We must continue to fight." He also thanked the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's struggle.

    当晚，对外文协广州分会举行了欢迎宴会。
    杜国庠在宴会上致词欢迎日本朋友，他赞扬了日本人民在反美爱国正义斗争中取得的伟大胜利。中岛健藏在讲话中指出，日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争已经取得的初步胜利，一定能生根、发展和壮大起来。中岛健藏说，我们日本人民的希望是建立完全独立的国家，但是，日本目前处于美国从属国的地位，日本人民是不甘心于这种处境的，所以日本人民正越来越广泛地参加到反对日美安全条约的反美爱国正义斗争的行列中去。他说，我们懂得，日美安全条约的锋芒是针对中国和社会主义阵营，日本人民坚决反对美日反动派的这种阴谋活动。他说，我们一定要斗争下去。他还感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的支持。
