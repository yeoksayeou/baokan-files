The Vast Swamp Has Become a Great Granary

    "Catching up with Jiangnan" has been the wish of our commune members for many years, and this wish has only been realized this year. The yield of our first season crop—three wheat crops—has already caught up with Jiangnan! The average yield per mu of our team's 3,030 mu of three wheat crops was 450 jin, more than double that of last year! The average yield per mu of the more than 40,000 mu of three wheat crops in our entire commune also reached 202 jin, double that of last year.

    When drinking water, don't forget the well-diggers. This year's bumper harvest is due to the leadership of the Party, the people's commune, and the selfless assistance of the elder brothers of the Wuxi workers. The place where our team is located is called "Nanguan Swamp," with a total of more than 30,000 mu of land, and for more than half of the year it is a vast expanse of water, and crops are rarely harvested in nine out of ten years. After liberation, although the Party and the government led us to carry out large-scale water conservancy projects, the problem was not completely solved. This land could only grow one season of wheat a year, and it was either a major flood or a minor flood. Planting one mu of wheat, if the harvest was good, only yielded a few dozen jin.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the situation has been different. We have expanded water conservancy construction, and the commune has begun to have drainage and irrigation machines, especially this year, when the elder brothers of the Wuxi workers sent us several water pumps, which solved the problem. Now, drainage ditches and irrigation canals crisscross the lake and swamp, and with the addition of machine drainage and irrigation, we are not afraid of drought or flood. In March of this year, it didn't rain for more than a month. At this time, water pumps and diesel engines showed their power, sucking water from the Shu River to irrigate. In five days, the more than 3,000 mu of wheat seedlings in the entire team quickly turned from yellow to green, defeating the drought demon.

    The elder brothers of the Wuxi workers not only sent us machinery and equipment, but also sent many technical workers. Now our county and commune can not only repair machines, but also manufacture rice transplanters, harvesters, water pumps, and diesel engines ourselves. The dusting cannons manufactured by our commune's machinery factory are very effective in killing insects. In mid-April of this year, more than 800 mu of wheat in our team were found to have stem rust and leaf rust, so we used this kind of spraying cannon to kill insects, spraying five fen of land with one shot. In just one day, we universally treated the diseased wheat once. During this year's summer planting, because we had corn close-planting machines and rice transplanters, we completed the summer planting and summer transplanting tasks ahead of schedule under the condition of tight labor, laying a good foundation for this year's autumn harvest. We are determined to build on this foundation, work harder, strive for a greater autumn harvest, and strive to make the grain yield exceed the targets set in the "Forty Articles Program" within this year, and cross the Yangtze River.

    大水荡变成了大粮仓
    “赶江南”，是我们社员多少年来的愿望，而这个愿望今年才实现，今年的第一季庄稼——三麦的产量已经赶上了江南！我们队三千零三十亩三麦平均亩产四百五十斤，比去年增加两倍多！我们全公社的四万多亩三麦，平均每亩也达到了二百零二斤，比去年翻了一番。
    吃水不忘挖井人。今年能取得这样的大丰收，要归功党的领导，要归功人民公社，还要感谢无锡工人老大哥的无私援助。我们这个队所在的地方叫做“南关荡”，总共有三万多亩土地，一年有大半年都是一片汪洋，种庄稼是十年九不收。解放后虽然党和政府领导我们大兴水利，也没有彻底解决问题。这块地一年只能种一季麦子，还是大雨大灾，小雨小灾。种上一亩麦子，收得好，只有几十斤。
    1958年大跃进以来，情况可不同了，我们扩大了水利建设，社里开始有了排灌机器，特别是今年，无锡市的工人老大哥，给我们送来了好几台抽水机，这下子解决了问题。现在湖荡内排水沟和灌溉渠纵横交错，再加上机器排水、灌溉，旱涝都不怕了。今年3月，连着一个多月不下雨，这时，抽水机、柴油机大显威力，它们把沭河的水吸上来灌溉，五天，全队三千多亩麦苗儿很快就由黄转青，战胜了旱魔。
    无锡工人老大哥不仅给我们送来了机器设备，还派来许多技术工人。现在我们县和社里，不但可以修机器，自己也可以制造插秧机、收割机、水泵和柴油机等。我们公社机械厂制造的喷粉炮，杀虫很灵验。今年4月中旬，我们队有八百多亩麦子发现有秆锈病和叶锈病，就用这种喷药炮杀虫，一炮就喷洒五分地，仅仅一天的工夫，就把生病的麦子普遍地治了一次。今年夏种时，因为有了玉米密植播器和插秧机，在劳动力紧张情况下，也提前完成了夏种夏插任务，为今年秋季大丰收又打下了良好的基础。我们决心在这个基础上，劲上加劲，力争秋熟来个更大的丰收，争取在今年内使粮食产量超过“四十条纲要”所规定的指标，跨过长江。
