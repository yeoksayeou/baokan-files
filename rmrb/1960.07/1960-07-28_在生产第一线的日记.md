    Diary from the Production Front Line
    Tu Yuhua, Party General Branch Secretary of Jiujie Commune, Zhai Village Management Area, Xinzhou County, Hubei
    June 18th
    The east had just begun to glow white when squad leader Mei Dunwen hurriedly got out of bed and rushed out the door. Unexpectedly, before his work call whistle could sound, the commune members had already gathered on the street and set off, singing loudly.
    According to the work arrangement last night, a large number of laborers will continue to go up the mountain to collect green manure. I hurriedly picked up my sickle and caught up with the commune members' labor brigade at the entrance of the village. Poor peasant commune members Mei Shaohuai and others stopped me, advising me, "You went up the mountain and worked all day yesterday, you're already tired enough, go home and rest!" After much persuasion, I was finally approved to join their ranks.
    The battle to collect green manure began. The commune members’ hands never stopped wielding their sickles, their mouths never stopped talking, chasing each other and laughing.
    "Hey! How did you get up so early today?" someone jokingly asked a neighboring commune member.
    "Oh! The pot calling the kettle black, when I used to go to work, you were still sleeping in bed!"
    Another interjected, "To tell you the truth, if Secretary Tu hadn't helped us to improve the labor quota management system, where would we get this kind of energy!"
    From these remarks, it occurred to me that, from the perspective of the commune members themselves, it is very disgraceful to work simply for the sake of earning work points; however, as a leader, it is wrong not to pay attention to doing a good job in this area.
    In the beginning, when I came to this squad, the squad's whistle for calling out to work was blown every morning, but the number of people going to work was still sparse. When cutting grass, one person a day could barely manage a hundred catties. After in-depth understanding, it turned out that it was because they had not implemented quota management and carried out the principle of more work, more pay. The commune members said, "No matter whether you go to work early or late, no matter how much you work, there's no distinction, everything is recorded according to the base score." Yesterday, I worked with the commune members to cut grass, experimented, and jointly studied this issue, deciding to record four work points for every hundred catties cut. It seems that this method has an immediate effect. Today, all forty-odd commune members of the squad turned out. On average, each person cut more than three hundred catties of grass, and everyone reached the quota standard.
    June 23rd
    Last night, at the team committee meeting, many people criticized the cadres of the second squad. They said that the reason why their production was lagging behind and the fields were severely weedy was no one else's fault, but their own lack of effort, always wanting to rely on others for support. After the meeting, I couldn't fall asleep for a long time, repeatedly thinking about the problems of this squad. This squad's labor force and land are similar to those of other squads, so why are they always lagging behind? Is it that the commune members are not working hard enough? I can't draw that conclusion. So, I decided that I must go to the second squad today to find out what's going on.
    In the morning, when I arrived at this squad, the commune members were pulling barnyard grass in the fields. While working, I chatted with the commune members. Some commune members said, "Secretary Tu has come to help us. Do you think our team can improve from now on?!"
    "What use is one person? Everyone's affairs still rely on everyone to handle."
    "If the labor is not arranged well, we can't do anything even if we are anxious!" Poor peasant commune member He Mengzhai continued, "For example, in the matter of arranging work, people who are good at weeding are arranged by the squad leader to operate the waterwheel, women who are suitable for pulling barnyard grass are arranged to wade in the paddy fields to pull rice seedlings...."
    The commune members' reflection of these situations shows that the backwardness of production in this squad is a problem of improper labor allocation, and at the same time, it is also a problem of the cadres' work style. At that time, I supported the correct opinions of the commune members and helped the squad leader immediately mobilize everyone to study the production for the next day. Work was divided according to each person's strengths, and everyone was very satisfied. The squad leader also said, "Secretary Tu, please settle down in our team."
    June 25th
    After the wheat harvest, how to make the public canteen adapt to the new situation of being mainly based on wheat foods is a problem. According to the commune members, it is called: "With good things, we must make delicious food." This is not a small matter, we must treat it as a major matter to grasp. I set up a test canteen for diversified wheat foods in the third squad of the fourth team. Can the experience of this canteen blossom throughout the management area? One day, I and the comrades of the district's production and livelihood inspection team ran to various places, inspecting and promoting the new experience of this canteen at the same time.
    At the beginning, the canteen of the third squad only served "wheat cakes," and some people were not used to eating them and had opinions. According to the Party's spirit of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," I went to the kitchen as a cook for a few days. On the one hand, I talked to the cooks and patiently educated them to run the collective life well, and on the other hand, I helped them reform the cooking tools, reduce their labor burden, thereby freeing up more time to consider how to achieve diversified wheat foods. When the commune members ate the soft and large steamed buns and the thin and long hot noodles for the first time, everyone praised them. Someone spontaneously composed a clapper rhyme and sang: "The canteen is good, the canteen is good, the wheat foods eaten are diversified, and we are more energetic when we work." That noon, the people who came with the inspection team also ate in this canteen. Everyone ate, listened (to the introduction of experience), and watched, and all said they would do the same when they returned!
    It seems that grasping production and grasping life is a pair of inseparable conjoined pants. In order to grasp production well, we must first grasp life well; and to grasp life well, leading cadres must also go deep into the front line and set an example in the kitchen.
    July 8th
    I heard that there is a commune member in the third squad nicknamed "Dead Rogue," who always dawdles when working and likes to complain. The squad has criticized him several times, but he hasn't changed at all. The squad leader said angrily, "His backwardness cannot be moved by two oxen!"
    "Who exactly is this 'Dead Rogue'?" I'll go and see. I really didn't expect it to be poor peasant commune member Dai Shoucheng. During the land reform, we often worked together, and he performed very well. How could he have become a "Dead Rogue"? Since he is an old acquaintance, I worked and chatted with him at the same time to find out the details. After specific analysis, it turned out to be like this: During the period of collectivization, he was confused for a while and listened to the instigation of wealthy middle peasants, joining the cooperative one step late; later, when he asked to join the cooperative, he made a self-criticism. But since then, others still regarded him as a "backward" element, and he himself carried this ideological burden, unable to raise his head in front of others. Coincidentally, his wife has made progress, but she is not very patient with her husband, complaining that he is always lagging behind, and the two of them are either quarreling or being cold and indifferent. Dai Shoucheng's mood has become lower and lower.
    Based on these situations, I feel that this "Dead Rogue" is not unreformable, the key lies in educating the cadres and commune members (including his wife), to be enthusiastic towards him, and to give him more care, encouragement and help. The day before yesterday, I found that his reclamation plowing was of good quality, so I immediately proposed to praise him at the commune members' meeting, and he immediately became active on the spot. His wife, after my persuasion and mobilization, also improved her attitude towards him. The two no longer quarrel, going to work and returning home together. Yesterday, when they went up the mountain to cut grass, the couple even secretly launched a competition! The commune members all said, "Dead Rogue" has become Dai Shoucheng again from the time of the land reform!
    Today, Dai Shoucheng took the initiative to talk to me about many new situations and new problems in the team. I think there may be "Dead Rogue"-style figures in other production teams as well, and we should break through these "dead corners" and mobilize their enthusiasm, so that they can also build socialism happily.

    在生产第一线的日记
    湖北新洲县旧街公社?寨管理区党总支书记　涂玉华
    六月十八日
    东方刚刚露白，小队长梅?文急忙爬起床来，冲出门去。不料，他的出工哨子还没吹响，社员们已在街头集合出发了，还唱着嘹亮的歌声。
    根据昨晚的活路安排，今天大批劳动力继续上山打青积肥。我急忙拿起镰刀，在村头赶上了社员们的劳动大队。贫农社员梅少怀等把我拉住，劝着我说：“你昨天上山干了一天，已经够累了，还是回家休息吧！”经过七说八说，好不容易才被批准参加了他们的行列。
    打青的战斗开始了。只见社员的一个个手不停镰，口不歇气，互相追逐，说笑风生。
    “喂！你今天怎么起得这早？”有人向相邻的社员打趣地问道。
    “哟！乌鸦笑肥猪黑，往日我出工时，你还在床上睡懒觉呢！”
    另一个插嘴说：“说句实话，要不是涂书记帮助我们搞好了劳动定额管理制度，那有这股子干劲啊！”
    从这些言谈中，使我想到：从社员本身来讲，如果单纯为了得工分而劳动，那是很不光彩的；但是，作为一个领导者来说，如果不注意搞好这方面的工作，也是不对的。
    开始，我来到这个小队时，每天早晨小队催出工的口哨吹破了，出工人数还是稀稀落落的。打起草来，一人一天百把斤是多的。经过深入了解，原来是由于他们没有实行定额管理，贯彻多劳多得。社员们说：“出工迟早，做活多少，都不分个青红皂白，一律按底分记账。”昨天，同社员们一道打青，经过试验，共同研究了这个问题，决定每割一百斤记工四分。看来这个办法立竿见影。今天全小队四十多个社员都出动了。平均每人打草三百多斤，人人都达到了定额标准。
    六月二十三日
    昨天夜里，在队委会上，有不少人批评了二小队的干部。说他们所以生产落后，田里草荒严重，不怪别的，只怪自己不努力，总想依靠别人支援。散会后，我好久未能入睡，反复想着这个小队的问题。这个队论劳力，论土地，都和别的小队差不多，为什么老是落在人家后面呢？是社员不努力吗？不能这样下结论。于是，我决定今天一定要到二小队去了解一番。
    上午，我到这个小队时，社员们正在田间扯稗草。在劳动当中，我就同社员们闲谈了起来。有的社员说：“涂书记来帮助我们了。看我们队今后能有点起色不？！”
    “我一个人顶什么用？大家的事还靠大家来办。”
    “劳力安排不好，我们干着急也不行啊！”贫农社员何盟斋接着说开了：“比方排工这件事吧，会薅草的人，小队干部却安排他们去车水，妇女们适合扯稗草，又安排去趟水田扯秧草……。”
    社员反映这些情况，说明这个小队的生产落后，劳动力安排不当是一个问题，同时这也是干部作风问题。当时，我支持了社员的正确意见，并帮助小队长立即发动大家研究第二天的生产。根据各人特长进行了分工，大家都很满意。小队长也说：“涂书记，你在我们队落户吧。”
    六月二十五日
    麦收以后，如何使公共食堂适应以面食为主的新情况，是一个问题。按社员的说法，就叫：“有了好东西，要办出好吃。”这不是一件小事，我们要把它当作一件大事情来抓。我在四队第三小队办了个面食多样化的试验食堂。这个食堂的经验能不能在全管理区开花？一天，我同全区生产、生活检查团的同志们一道，跑到各地去，边检查、边推广这个食堂的新经验。
    三小队食堂，开始光吃“麦?粑”，有些人吃不惯，有意见。根据党的“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的精神，我到厨房当了几天炊事员。一方面和炊事员谈心，耐心地教育炊事员要把集体生活办好，一方面帮助他们改革了炊事工具，减轻了他们劳动负担，从而腾出较多的时间，考虑如何做到面食多样化。当社员们第一次吃上了又泡（即松软的意思）又大的香馍馍和又细又长的热面条时，个个称赞。有人顺口编起快板唱道：“食堂好，食堂好，吃的面食多样化，干起活来劲头高。”这天中午，检查团来的人，也在这个食堂吃了饭。大家边吃，边听（听介绍经验），边看，都表示回去要照样办！
    看来，抓生产和抓生活，是一条分不开的连裆裤，为了抓好生产，首先要抓好生活；而要抓好生活，也必须领导干部深入第一线，到厨房去做出个样子。
    七月八日
    听说，第三小队有个绰号叫“死痞子”的社员，干活老是磨洋工，而且爱发牢骚。小队里批评过几次，丝毫未改。小队长生气地说：“他那股落后劲，两只牛也拉不动”！
    “死痞子到底是谁”，待我前去看看。真没想到竟是贫农社员戴首成。土改时，我们常在一块搞工作，他表现很好。怎么会变成个“死痞子”呢？既是老熟人，我就同他边干活边谈心，摸底细。具体分析以后，原来是这样：在合作化时期，他一时糊涂，听了富裕中农的煽动，入社迟了一步；后来要求进社时，曾作过检讨。可是从此以后，别人仍然把他看成是个“落后”分子，他自己也就背上了这个思想包袱，在人前抬不起头来。可巧，他的老婆进步了，但是对丈夫却不大耐心，嫌他老落后，俩口子不是吵嘴，就是冷冷淡淡的。戴首成情绪就越落越低。
    根据这几方面的情况，我觉得这个“死痞子”不是不可改造的，关键在于教育干部和社员（包括他的爱人），对他要热情，多加关怀、鼓励和帮助。前天，我发现他开荒犁地，质量很好，便马上提出在社员大会上进行了表扬，当场他就活跃起来。他的老婆，经过我的说服动员，对他的态度也好了。俩人不再吵吵闹闹，出工收工齐出齐进。昨天上山打草，这俩夫妻还暗地开展了竞赛哩！社员们看了都说：“死痞子”又变成土改时候的戴首成了！
    今天，戴首成又主动向我谈了队里的许多新情况和新问题。我觉得“死痞子”式的人物，别的生产队里可能也有，应当突破这些“死角”，调动他们的积极性，叫他们也兴高彩烈地来建设社会主义。
