Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: At a press conference held here this afternoon, Nguyen Duc Duong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, announced Premier and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's letter of July 16th to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The letter requests the two chairmen to take appropriate measures to stop and end all interference by US imperialism in South Vietnam, and also demands that the South Vietnamese authorities cease their suppression and persecution of former resistance members and strictly implement the Geneva Accords. The full text of the letter is as follows:

	To the Two Chairmen:

	The 1954 Geneva Accords restored peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unification, and territorial integrity. The agreement stipulated that free nationwide general elections must be held by July 1956 to unify Vietnam.

	However, six years have passed since the signing of the Geneva Accords, and peace in Indochina is still under threat. Vietnamese territory remains divided, the independence and national sovereignty of South Vietnam have not been realized, and the democratic freedoms of the South Vietnamese people have been brutally trampled upon. Currently, the Geneva Accords are being distorted and violated in South Vietnam more blatantly than ever before.

	The root cause of this situation lies in the US imperialist policy of aggression and war, and in the subordination of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam to the United States.

	US imperialism is the instigator behind the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's rejection of all constructive proposals by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam aimed at achieving the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. They deliberately maintain the long-term division of Vietnam in order to enslave the South Vietnamese people and turn South Vietnam into a new type of colony and military base for the United States to prepare for re-igniting war.

	For six years, disregarding the various prohibitions of the Geneva Accords, US weapons and military personnel have been continuously and illegally transported into South Vietnam. Under the direct command of a whole set of US imperialist military institutions established in South Vietnam, a series of military airfields, military ports, and strategic highways have been and are being constructed very intensively in South Vietnam. South Vietnam is, in fact, becoming a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc.

	In coordination with the imperialist policy of aggression and war preparations, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has, over the years, adopted all kinds of extremely brutal fascist means to intensify the extremely barbaric policies of persecution and slaughter against former resistance members, patriots, and peace-loving people in South Vietnam.

	The French imperialist war of aggression ended as early as 1954. However, under the rule of US imperialism and its lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the people of South Vietnam are living in a state of endless war, and people's right to survival and all basic freedoms are being severely trampled upon.

	It is very regrettable that the International Commission for Vietnam, which in the past had strived to contribute to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the maintenance of peace in Vietnam, has recently passed, by a majority vote, some resolutions that are contrary to the Geneva Accords. I have already had the opportunity to inform the two chairmen about this matter.

	These resolutions clearly create conditions for US imperialism to strengthen its interference in South Vietnam, increase threats to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and endanger peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	On our part, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and unswervingly made every effort to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and cooperate well with the International Commission for Vietnam in order to peacefully reunify Vietnam and contribute to the cause of maintaining peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world.

	The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always believed that to maintain and safeguard peace in this region, it is necessary to stop the US imperialist policy of aggression and war in South Vietnam, and at the same time demand that the South Vietnamese authorities respect and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords.

	It is even more urgent to take the above-mentioned measures now when US imperialism is intensifying its interference in South Vietnam more than ever before, when the puppet regime in South Vietnam is intensifying its suppression of former resistance members and all patriots in South Vietnam more than ever before, and when US imperialism is blatantly undermining Cambodia's neutral policy and plotting to turn Laos into a US military base.

	The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respectfully requests the two chairmen to urgently consider the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam in order to take appropriate measures to stop and end all interference by US imperialism in South Vietnam, and at the same time demand that the South Vietnamese authorities cease their suppression and persecution of former resistance members and strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

	I extend my respects to the two chairmen.

	Pham Van Dong
	Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
	July 16, 1960, in Hanoi

    范文同总理致函日内瓦会议两位主席
　　要求制止美国对越南南方的干涉
　　指出美国的侵略政策是日内瓦协议受到破坏的根源
    新华社河内19日电　越南民主共和国外交部副部长阮德扬今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上公布了范文同外长7月16日就日内瓦协议执行情况给日内瓦会议两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的信。信中要求两位主席采取适当的措施来制止和结束美帝国主义对南越的一切干涉，同时要求南越当局停止对前抗战人员的镇压和迫害，并且严正地履行日内瓦协议。信的全文如下：
    两位主席：
    1954年日内瓦协议在承认越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复了印度支那的和平。这个协议规定到1956年7月必须举行全国范围的自由普选以统一越南。
    然而，日内瓦协议签订迄今已经六年了，印度支那的和平仍然受到威胁，越南领土还被分割着，越南南方的独立和国家主权还没有得到实现，越南南方人民的民主自由权利遭到了非常粗暴的摧残。目前日内瓦协议在越南南方正在受到比任何时候都更为明目张胆的歪曲和破坏。
    这种状态的根源，是美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，以及越南南方的吴庭艳政权对美国的隶属而引起的。
    美帝国主义是吴庭艳政权拒绝越南民主共和国政府旨在达到和平统一越南的一切建设性的建议唆使者，他们蓄意保持长期分割越南的状态，以便于奴役越南南方人民，把越南南方变成美国准备重新挑起战争的新型的殖民地和军事基地。
    六年来，不顾日内瓦协议的各项禁止条款，美国武器和军事人员不断地非法运入越南南方。在美帝国主义设立在越南南方的一整套军事机构的直接指挥下，一系列的军用机场、军港、战略公路已经和正在越南南方非常紧张地进行修建。越南南方事实上正在变成为东南亚条约组织军事集团的成员。
    同帝国主义的侵略和备战政策相配合，几年来，吴庭艳政权采取了一切非常残暴的法西斯手段，对越南南方前抗战人员，爱祖国、爱和平的人士加紧施行极其野蛮的迫害和屠杀政策。
    法帝国主义的侵略战争早在1954年就已经结束。但在美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的统治下，越南南方人民正生活在连绵无期的战争状态中，人们的生存权利和各种起码的自由权利也都遭到非常严重的践踏。
    非常遗憾的是，过去曾经努力为日内瓦协议的履行和维护越南的和平作出过自己的贡献的越南国际委员会，最近竟以多数票通过了和日内瓦协议相违背的一些决议。关于这件事我已有机会通知两位主席。
    这些决议显然为美帝国主义加强对越南南方的干涉，增加威胁越南民主共和国的安宁以及印度支那和东南亚的和平创造了条件。
    在我们方面，越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地不惜作出一切努力来严正履行日内瓦协议，同越南国际委员会良好地合作，以便和平统一越南，为维护印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平事业作出贡献。
    越南民主共和国政府一向认为，要维护和保卫这个地区的和平，就必须制止美帝国主义在越南南方的侵略和战争政策，同时要求越南南方当局必须尊重和彻底履行日内瓦协议。
    当美帝国主义比任何时候都更加加紧对越南南方进行干涉，在越南南方的仆从政权比任何时候都更加变本加厉地镇压越南南方的前抗战人员和一切爱国人士，同时美帝国主义明目张胆地破坏柬埔寨的中立政策和阴谋把老挝变成为美国的军事基地的时候，目前采取上述的措施就更加迫切需要。
    越南民主共和国政府谨要求两位主席紧急考虑关于越南的日内瓦协议的履行情况，以便采取适当的措施来制止和结束美帝国主义对越南南方的一切干涉，同时要求越南南方当局停止对前抗战人员的镇压和迫害，并且严正地履行日内瓦协议。
    我谨向两位主席致以敬意。越南民主共和国外交部长　范文同
    1960年7月16日于河内
