    Red Flowers and Green Leaves
    Dong Yixiang, Carpenter at the Zhonghua Shipyard
    After seeing the Shanghai Opera "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," I had a feeling: if Lin Peifen is compared to a red flower, then the old cobbler is the green leaf supporting the red flower.

    The old cobbler is a simple and honest working person, possessing the heroic qualities of our working class. He tirelessly wanders through the neighborhoods carrying his shoe-repairing tools, just to make things convenient for more people. When Gu Huizhen, a member of a bourgeois family, said to him, "Aren't I paying you?" and asked him to quickly finish her slippers, he replied so well, "You don't work and just stay at home, what's the rush?" This fully demonstrates his class stance and his labor viewpoint of serving the people. He labors to make things convenient for more people, not just for a few coins.

    It is precisely because he has firmly stood on the working-class position that when he learned about the neighborhood's plan to start a people's school, he was the first to raise his hand in support. Even for the issue of preparing school buildings, he vacated his only room, which was about the size of a garage, for public use. This selfless communist style, compared with the thinking of the bourgeois family member Gu Huizhen, who thinks only of herself, is vastly different.

    Why does the old cobbler have two different attitudes towards Gu Huizhen and Lin Peifen? Mainly because he suffered enough from the bourgeoisie and reactionaries in the old society and understands the happiness of today's life. Therefore, when he sees that Gu Huizhen still wants to use the past bourgeois methods to treat our working people, how could he not stand up to oppose her? His two different attitudes towards Gu Huizhen and Lin Peifen clearly show his firm stance of loving the socialist cause.

    红花与绿叶
    中华造船厂木工　董义翔
    看了沪剧《鸡毛飞上天》后，心里有这样一种感觉：如果把林佩芬比作是红花，那末老皮匠就是扶持红花的绿叶。
    老皮匠是一个朴实的劳动人民，他具有我们工人阶级的英雄本色。他挑着皮鞋担在里弄中碌碌奔波，就是为了让更多的人得到方便。当资产阶级家属顾惠珍对他说：“难道我不给钱吗？”叫他快点把拖鞋作好的时候，他说得多好：“你又没有参加工作，呆在家里有啥急头？”这充分表现了他的阶级立场和为谁服务的劳动观点。他劳动是为了让更多的人得到方便，而不是为了几个钱。
    正因为他站稳了工人阶级立场，所以当他知道里弄要举办民校的消息后，就第一个举手赞成，甚至为了筹办校舍问题，他把自己仅有的一间汽车间那么大小的房间腾出来，给公家派用场；这种公而忘私的共产主义风格，与资产阶级家属顾惠珍那种处处为自己的思想相比，真有天渊之别。
    为啥老皮匠对待顾惠珍和林佩芬两个人会有两种不同的态度呢？主要是他在旧社会里尝够了资产阶级和反动派的苦头，更体会到今天生活的幸福，因此，当他看到顾惠珍还要用过去资产阶级的手段来对待我们劳动人民，怎么会不起来反对呢？他对待顾惠珍和林佩芬所采取的两种不同的态度，正表明他热爱社会主义事业的鲜明立场。
