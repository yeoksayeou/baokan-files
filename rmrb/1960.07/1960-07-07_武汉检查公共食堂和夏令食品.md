Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 4th: Wuhan Municipality conducted a major inspection of summer food hygiene in all food industries and public canteens, further promoting food hygiene work throughout the city and ensuring the health of the masses.

In early June, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to conduct a major inspection of summer food hygiene throughout the city, to further promote food hygiene work in all units. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, a municipal inspection team was established, with the participation of heads of various departments in charge. Each district established sub-teams, and each system, factory, and street also established corresponding inspection organizations. From early June to late June, they repeatedly inspected the food hygiene work of all links in the food industry, including production, storage, transportation, and sales, as well as the food hygiene work of all collective canteens. In the inspection, leaders focused on spot checks combined with general self-inspection by the broad masses, and according to the principle of inspecting, handling, and improving simultaneously, all discovered problems were handled conscientiously and promptly. The Second Municipal Bureau of Commerce transferred more than two hundred grass-roots cadres to concentrate on studying food inspection techniques, strengthened and improved food inspection agencies from top to bottom, increased hygiene facilities, and dispatched a large number of cadres to various links of procurement, processing, storage, transportation, and sales to strengthen food inspection, achieving "layer-by-layer responsibility, step-by-step defense." They also compiled measures for doing a good job in food hygiene into requirements and precautions that staff must follow, so that the food hygiene work of the entire system is maintained regularly. The municipal and district health departments transferred many health workers and local doctors to go deep into factories, shops, and streets to hold training courses and carry out various publicity activities, helping food workers and cooks improve their food hygiene knowledge, specifically helping to establish and improve various hygiene systems, and further improve food hygiene work. Leaders of various factories, schools, and streets also went deep into the canteens to strengthen leadership over the canteens and specifically help improve the hygiene work of the canteens.

This inspection adopted the method of inserting red flags and establishing pacesetters, commending and rewarding more than three hundred advanced food hygiene units that were discovered, and held on-site meetings in these units to summarize and promote their advanced experience in a timely manner.

Through this mass food hygiene inspection, the food hygiene work of food factories, vegetable markets, shops, restaurants, and canteens throughout the city has entered a new stage, with batches of advanced units emerging. In Jiang'an District alone, more than thirty vegetable markets have reached the first-class standard.
