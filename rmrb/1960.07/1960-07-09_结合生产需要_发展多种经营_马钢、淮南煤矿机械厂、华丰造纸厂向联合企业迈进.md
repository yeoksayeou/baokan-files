    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: Anhui Province's Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, closely combining production needs, vigorously develops diversified operations and comprehensive utilization with steel as the center. This not only transforms the original factory, which only produced iron, into an iron and steel joint enterprise capable of mining, coking, iron smelting, steel smelting, and steel rolling, but also develops it into a comprehensive joint enterprise with mechanical, construction, and chemical industries. This has played a significant role in the timely supply of raw materials needed for production and capital construction, and in accelerating the construction of this enterprise.
    With the rapid development of steel production, the company's need for machinery and equipment has increased. In order to solve the supply problem of these machines and equipment, the company has developed the machine repair factory, power department, and mechanical installation engineering department, from units that only performed maintenance, repair, and installation of equipment to units that can produce machinery and equipment, undertaking the manufacturing tasks for some of the machine tools and iron-making, steel-making, and mining equipment needed by the company. According to statistics, since last year, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel machine repair factory and power department alone have produced 210 various types of machine tools and 263 electric motors. In terms of building materials, the company has successively established 28 building material factories, including a relatively large slag cement factory, refractory material factory, brick and tile kiln factory, sand and gravel processing factory, and hardware processing factory, which solved the problem of insufficient supply of building materials. At present, the company has one slag cement factory with an annual output of 200,000 tons and four small cement factories. The company's cement production is basically self-sufficient. The company has also developed the chemical industry. In the past year, they have extracted medium oil, heavy oil, light oil, and many light benzene, diesel, carbon black, and other chemical raw materials from three native coke plants and the large-scale coke oven that recently went into production; at the same time, they have also trial-produced 72 kinds of chemical products. In addition, they have used converter slag to establish a small phosphate fertilizer plant, and used locally produced pyrite to establish a sulfuric acid plant and a sulfur plant.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: Anhui Province's Huainan Coal Mine Machinery Factory, combining production needs and implementing comprehensive management, has developed into a joint enterprise centered on manufacturing coal mine machinery, while also producing steel smelting, iron smelting, and self-made ball bearings, electric motors, coke, cement, and other products.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the amount of raw materials, parts, and accessories needed by the Huainan Coal Mine Machinery Factory has been increasing. Under the correct leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, the factory party committee decided to mobilize the masses to vigorously establish satellite factories for the production of raw materials. In the past two years, they have successively built a steel plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons of pig iron, 30,000 tons of steel, and 3,000 tons of steel materials, an electric motor factory with an annual output of 2,000 kilowatts, a bearing factory with an annual output of 3,000 sets of bearings, a slag cement workshop with an annual output of 3,000 tons, a small hardware factory; and a coke oven with an annual output of 30,000 tons is also about to be put into production. In this way, this coal mine machinery factory has gradually formed a comprehensive joint enterprise.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Dispatch: Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill vigorously develops diversified operations, self-manufactures equipment to expand paper-making capacity, and has basically achieved self-sufficiency in chemical raw materials such as caustic soda and bleaching powder used for paper making.
    The chemical workshop built by this factory can produce 4,700 tons of alkali and 3,700 tons of liquid chlorine annually. These raw materials have played a significant role in the high-quality and high-yield production of paper. At the same time, this factory has also used self-made paper-making equipment and technical forces to help Fuyang and other counties and communes develop a number of small-scale paper-making enterprises.

    结合生产需要　发展多种经营
    马钢、淮南煤矿机械厂、华丰造纸厂向联合企业迈进
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省马鞍山钢铁公司紧密结合生产的需要，以钢铁为中心大搞多种经营和综合利用，不仅使这个原来只生产铁的工厂，变成了一个能采矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢和轧钢的钢铁联合企业，而且还发展成为一个拥有机械工业、建筑工业、化学工业的综合性联合企业。这对及时供应生产、基本建设需要的原材料，加速这个企业的建设起了很大作用。
    随着钢铁生产的飞跃发展，这个公司需要的机具和设备更多了。为了解决这些机具和设备的供应问题，这个公司将机修厂、动力处以及机械安装工程处等单位，由原来只进行维护、检修和安装设备的单位发展成能生产机械设备的单位，担负了本公司需要的一部分机床和炼铁、炼钢、采矿等设备的制造任务。据统计，去年以来，仅马钢机修厂，动力处即生产了各类机床二百一十台、电动机二百六十三台。在建筑材料方面，这个公司先后办起了比较大的矿渣水泥厂、耐火材料厂、砖瓦窑厂、沙石加工厂、五金加工厂等二十八个建筑材料工厂，解决了建筑材料供应不足的问题。现在，全公司已有年产二十万吨的矿渣水泥厂一座，小水泥厂四座。全公司生产的水泥基本上做到了自给。这个公司还发展了化学工业。一年来他们从三座土焦厂以及最近投入生产的大型焦炉中，提取了中油、重油、轻油以及许多轻苯、柴油、炭黑等化工原料；同时还试制了七十二种化工产品。此外，他们还利用转炉渣兴办了一个小磷肥厂，并利用本地出产的硫化铁矿，兴办了硫酸厂、硫磺厂各一座。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省淮南煤矿机械厂结合生产需要，实行综合经营，已经发展成为一个以制造煤矿机械为中心，兼有炼钢、炼铁和自造滚珠轴承、电动机、焦炭、水泥等产品的联合企业。
    淮南煤矿机械厂从1958年大跃进以来，需要的原料材料和配件、附件的数量愈来愈大。工厂党委在省、市委的正确领导下，决定发动群众，大办生产原料材料的卫星工厂。两年多来，他们先后建设了年产生铁一万吨、钢三万吨、钢材三千吨的钢铁厂一个，年产总容量为二千瓩的电动机厂一个，年产三千套轴承的轴承厂一个，年产三千吨的矿渣水泥车间一个，小型五金厂一个；一个年产三万吨的焦炉也即将投入生产。这样，这个煤矿机械厂就逐步形成为综合性的联合企业。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省杭州市华丰造纸厂大搞多种经营，自造设备扩大造纸能力，造纸用的烧碱漂粉等化工原料已基本自给。
    这个厂建成的化工车间可年产四千七百吨碱、三千七百吨液体氯。这些原料为纸张的生产优质高产起了很大的作用。同时，这个厂还用自制的造纸设备和技术力量，帮助富阳等县和公社发展了一批小型造纸企业。（附图片）
