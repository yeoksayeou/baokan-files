　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Washington: Some senior U.S. military figures and politicians have recently continued to clamor for stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, and the U.S. government's arms expansion and war preparations activities are also being strengthened.

　　U.S. Army Secretary Brooke, who just concluded a ten-day visit to West Germany, yelled in Stuttgart, West Germany, yesterday that all U.S. troops stationed in Europe are "in a constant state of combat readiness," and that "troops (U.S.) stationed abroad must forever improve their combat readiness."

　　Brooke greatly praised West German militarism, which is being revived with strong U.S. support. He full-throatedly praised the West German army's "excellent situation" and its "significant progress."

　　Prior to this, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff White issued a gunpowder-filled clamor in Washington on the 11th. He yelled that the U.S. should speak to the Soviet Union in a "tough tone." This U.S. general, in an interview with "U.S. News & World Report," even brazenly declared that the U.S. intends to launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union, saying that "there is no doubt that U.S. bombers can invade Soviet territory, and still likely return safely."

　　Former President Hoover, in a statement to reporters, openly clamored that the U.S. must "remain armed to the teeth." At the same time, he also advocated that the U.S. should use "any possible" means to collect intelligence on the Soviet Union.

　　The Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, chaired by Democratic Senate Leader Johnson, issued a report advocating the accelerated development of the B-70 high-altitude bomber, which "can carry any atomic weapon" and conduct "various reconnaissance missions." While touting this type of bomber, the subcommittee openly issued war threats to the Chinese people, stating that if the Chinese people liberate their territory of Taiwan, these bombers could quickly fly from San Francisco to Taiwan.

　　At the same time, the U.S. government is taking a series of arms expansion and war preparation activities. The U.S. Department of Defense has ordered the acceleration of the construction of "Atlas" missile launch sites to ensure the "operationally ready date" of "Atlas" missile squadrons. Missile testing is also being stepped up. According to incomplete materials, in just nine days from June 30 to July 8, the U.S. launched eight missiles, almost one per day on average. U.S. President Eisenhower has also signed the 1961 fiscal year military appropriations bill, deciding to allocate more than 39.9 billion U.S. dollars to prepare for war.

    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国一些高级军人和政客最近继续不断发出加紧扩军备战的叫嚣，美国政府的扩军备战活动也在加强进行。
    刚结束对西德为期十天的访问的美国陆军部长布鲁克，昨天在西德斯图加特叫嚷说，所有驻在欧洲的美军都“处于经常战斗准备状态”，“驻在外国的（美国）军队必须永远提高战斗准备”。
    布鲁克对在美国的大力扶植下正在东山再起的西德军国主义大加赞赏。他满口称赞西德军队的“情况极佳”和取得了“显著的进步”。
    在这以前，美国空军参谋长怀特11日在华盛顿发出了充满火药味的叫嚣。他叫嚷美国要用“强硬的语气”同苏联说话。这个美国将军在对“美国新闻与世界报道”发表的谈话中，还公然声言美国打算发动侵苏战争，他说“毫无疑问，美国轰炸机能够侵入苏联领土，而且仍然可能安全地回来”。
    前总统胡佛在对记者发表谈话时公然叫嚷美国必须“保持武装到牙齿”。他同时还鼓吹美国要用
  “任何可能”的方式来收集苏联的情报。
    由民主党参议院领袖约翰逊担任主席的参议院军备小组委员会发表了一个报告，主张加紧发展
  “可以携带任何原子武器”和进行“各种各样侦察任务”的B—70型高空飞行轰炸机。这个小组委员会在吹嘘这种轰炸机时公然对中国人民发出战争恫吓，表示如果中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，这些轰炸机就可以迅速从旧金山飞抵台湾。
    在这同时，美国政府采取一系列扩军备战活动。美国国防部已经下令加速修建“阿特拉斯”导弹发射场的工作，以保证“阿特拉斯”导弹中队的“可供作战使用的日期”。导弹的试验工作也在加紧进行。据不完全材料，仅在6月30日到7月8日的九天中，美国就发射了八次导弹，几乎平均每天一次。美国总统艾森豪威尔也已经签署了1961财政年度的军事拨款法案，决定拨款三百九十九亿多美元充当准备战争的费用。
