　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 22nd - Hunan Province's financial and trade front departments' leaders have been going deep into the front lines of agricultural production, setting up front-line offices to strengthen leadership in supporting agriculture and current production in all aspects.
    To further deepen, specify, and solidify the work of supporting agricultural production, the Hunan Provincial Commercial Bureau recently decided that Deputy Director Li Zhenhua and Lin Wenxing would lead more than 20 cadres to ZaoShi in Leiyang County and NanDaShan commune in Yuanjiang County, establishing front-line offices to direct the battle. The heads of the Provincial Grain Bureau, the Hunan Branch of the People's Bank of China, and the Finance Bureau have also gone deep into the front lines of production to strengthen the leadership in supporting agriculture.
    After the leading cadres went deep into the front lines of production, they achieved good results in further linking with reality, discovering problems in a timely manner, and solving problems.

    　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd - While supporting agricultural technology transformation, financial and trade departments in Liaoning organized some finance and bank cadres and enterprise finance personnel to go to the countryside. Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, they helped communes carry out agricultural economic accounting work. This has had good results in the rational use of manpower, materials, and financial resources, improving labor efficiency, and improving leadership style.
    The principle of promoting rural economic accounting in Liaoning is: account for whatever is central; account for wherever the key lies. The content of the accounting varies from place to place. For example, Heishan County accounts for the "five rates": land utilization rate, labor efficiency, equipment utilization rate, livestock utilization rate, and capital turnover rate. The accounting steps are generally "one thing, three calculations": first, accounting before production, to better arrange production plans by tapping potential in various aspects; second, accounting during the production process, to track progress, quality, and work efficiency, and publish them in a timely manner to promote competition; third, accounting after the event, to summarize production achievements and check for existing problems after a production stage is over. Fuyu Brigade of Liangtun Commune in Gaiping County, by accounting for land and resource utilization rates, adopted methods such as reducing ridges and increasing rows, intercropping, and overlapping planting to expand arable land by 6%, which can increase grain production by 150,000 catties, and open up 28 diverse business avenues, increasing income by 640,000 yuan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd - In vigorously supporting agricultural production, commercial departments in Guangdong are actively and proactively organizing county and commune industries to use some local iron ore, local steel, and other raw and processed materials to produce large quantities of agricultural machinery and equipment.
    According to statistics from sixty-two counties and six hundred and six communes, industrial departments, with the full support and cooperation of local commercial departments, have manufactured 720 kinds of agricultural implements in the first five months of this year. These implements have played a huge role in supporting agricultural production. For example, before this year’s summer harvest, the Wanning County commercial department organized the supply of raw and processed materials to help commune-run industries produce 4,786 reapers, 2,472 threshers, 3,583 ox carts, 4,009 hand-pushed rubber-wheeled carts, and 385 boats. During the summer harvest, they basically achieved reaping rice with reapers, threshing with threshers, and transporting with carts and boats, overcoming the difficulty of labor shortages during the summer harvest and completing the summer harvest and planting tasks half a month ahead of schedule.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 22nd - Summer and autumn crops in Qinghai Province are currently growing well, and the summer harvest is about to begin. Commercial departments in various regions are actively organizing the production of summer and autumn harvest tools, striving to supply them in a timely manner.
    In the past two months, commercial departments in various regions have dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the front lines of agricultural production to investigate and understand the needs of agricultural implements, and formulated supply and marketing plans according to the needs. Since May, Minhe County has supplied more than 20,000 summer and autumn harvesting and threshing tools such as brooms, forks, wooden rakes, and rickshaws.
    Commercial department employees in various regions have also made every effort to carry out mass movements to deliver goods to the door and to the fields, to ensure that agricultural implements are supplied to the communes in a timely manner. According to statistics from Xining, Minhe, Hualong, Tongren, and Menyuan five cities and counties alone, more than 25,000 pieces of production tools and more than 3.8 million catties of fertilizers, pesticides, and organic fertilizers have been sent to various communes.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd - Employees of the banking system in Jilin Province, starting from the characteristics of banking business, have widely carried out the "Ten Support" campaign, which has already made significant achievements.
    Since this spring, more than 5,000 cadres from the provincial banking system have gone deep into the communes with funds and materials. More than 70% of the agricultural loans issued in the province in the first half of the year were delivered to the door by bank employees.
    In the movement to support agricultural production, banking departments at all levels have made it an important task to support the development of production in management areas and production teams with relatively weak economic foundations. According to statistics at the end of June, the provincial banking departments have dispatched 857 long-term cadres to management areas and production teams with relatively weak economic foundations to help poor teams develop production. The Huadian County branch bank adopted measures such as helping communes make plans, helping communes find production avenues, helping communes open up commodity bases, and prioritizing loans, material supplies, and procurement to focus on helping thirteen poor management areas open up more than 20 commodity bases. In the first half of the year, the average income level of these thirteen management areas has already caught up with the local wealthy management areas.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 22nd - Finance and financial departments at all levels in Yunnan Province have trained more than 170,000 financial cadres above the production team level for rural people's communes throughout the province in various forms, which has played a good role in promoting the consolidation and improvement of the communes and the correct implementation of the party's various policies.
    After training, these financial cadres have clearer political views, production views, and mass views, and are more motivated in their work, diligently managing collective finances. When making distribution plans, they generally master the distribution policies, ensuring that the distribution plans can quickly meet with the masses, and playing a significant role in the timely Xiaochun distribution and the year-end distribution of last year. In normal times, they generally ensure that work point accounts are clear, daily settlements are made, and announcements are made on schedule. They also conscientiously implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, providing data through bookkeeping and accounting, disclosing finances, and conducting economic accounting and analysis of economic activities with the masses to promote the reduction of production costs.

    各地财贸干部深入农业第一线
    湖南

    湖南省各级财贸部门为了进一步把支援农业生产的工作作得更深入、更具体、更扎实，最近省商业厅决定由副厅长李振华、林文兴带领二十多个干部，分赴耒阳县灶市和沅江县南大膳两公社，成立前线办公室，指挥战斗。省粮食厅、中国人民银行湖南省分行、财政厅的负责人也都深入生产第一线，加强支援农业的领导。

    辽宁
    本报沈阳22日电  辽宁各地财贸部门在支援农业技术改造的同时，组织一部分财政、银行干部和企业财务人员下乡，在公社党委统一领导下，帮助公社开展农业经济核算工作，收到了合理使用人力、物力、财力，提高劳动效率，改进领导作风的良好效果。
    辽宁各地推行农村经济核算的原则是：中心是什么就核算什么；关键在哪里就核算到哪里。核算的内容，因地制宜，多种多样。如黑山县核算“五率”：土地利用率、劳动效率、设备利用率、牲畜使用率和资金周转率。核算步骤，一般是“一事三算”，先是生产前的核算，通过挖掘各方面的潜力，更好地安排生产规划；其次是在生产过程中核算，统计进度、质量和工效，及时公布，推动竞赛；第三是事后核算，在一个生产阶段结束后，总结生产成绩，检查存在的问题，盖平县梁屯公社富裕大队，通过核算土地和资源利用率，采取缩垅增行、间种、套种等办法，扩大了耕地面积6％，可以增产粮食十五万斤；开辟多种经营门路二十八种，增加收入六十四万元。
    广东
    本报广州22日电  广东各地商业部门在大力支援农业生产中，积极主动地组织县、社工业利用部分土铁土钢和其他原料材料，大量生产农业机具、设备。
    根据六十二个县、六百零六个公社的统计，工业部门在当地商业部门的全面支援和协作下，今年头五个月，已制成七百二十种农具，这些农具，在支援农业生产中发挥了巨大作用。例如，万宁县商业部门在今年夏收以前，组织原料材料供应，帮助社办工业生产了收割器四千七百八十六部，打谷机二千四百七十二部，牛车三千五百八十三部，手推胶轮车四千零九部，船艇三百八十五只，在夏收中基本上做到了割稻用收割器，脱粒用打谷机，运输用车、船，克服夏收期间劳力不足的困难，提前半个月完成了夏收夏种任务。
    青海
    新华社西宁22日电　青海省的夏秋农作物目前生长良好，夏收即将开始，各地商业部门正在积极组织夏收、秋收工具的生产，力争及时供应。
    近两个月来，各地商业部门曾抽调大批干部深入农业生产第一线，调查了解农具的需要情况，根据需要，制订了供销计划。民和县从5月份以来，已供应了扫帚、杈子、木铣、人力车等夏收、秋收打碾工具两万多件。
    各地商业部门职工还千方百计开展送货上门、送货到田间的群众运动，以保证农具及时供应到公社。仅据西宁、民和、化隆、同仁、门源五个市、县的统计，就给各公社送去生产工具两万五千多件，化肥、农药、有机肥料三百八十多万斤。
    吉林
    据新华社长春22日电　吉林省银行系统职工从银行业务特点出发，广泛开展“十大支援”运动，已经做出了显著成绩。
  今春以来，全省银行系统已有五千多名干部携款带物深入公社。上半年全省发放的农业贷款有70％以上是由银行职工送上门发放的。
    在支援农业生产运动中，各级银行部门都把支援经济基础比较薄弱的管理区和生产队发展生产，做为一项重要任务。据到6月末的统计，全省银行部门共为经济基础比较薄弱的管理区和生产队下派了八百五十七名长驻干部，帮助穷队发展生产。桦甸县支行采取帮助公社作规划，帮助公社找生产门路，帮助公社开辟商品基地和优先贷款、优先供应物资、优先收购等措施，重点帮助十三个穷管理区开辟了二十多处商品基地，上半年这十三个管理区，每人的平均收入水平已经赶上了当地富裕管理区。
    云南
    据新华社昆明22日电　云南省各级财政、金融部门，应用各种形式为全省农村人民公社培养训练了生产队以上的财务干部十七万多人，对于促进公社的巩固提高和正确贯彻党的各项政策，起了良好的作用。
    这些财务干部经过训练以后，政治观点、生产观点和群众观点更加明确，在工作中干劲更足，勤勤恳恳地管好集体财务。他们在搞分配方案时，一般都能掌握分配政策，保证了分配方案能迅速和群众见面，对今年公社及时进行小春分配和做好去年的年终分配等工作，起了很大的作用。在平时，他们一般也做到了工分账目清楚，日清月结，按期公布。他们还认真地贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，通过记账、算账，提供资料，公开财务，与群众一道进行经济核算和经济活动分析，促使生产费用降低。
