    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 6th: Lin Xiulan, a student at Tianjin University and the daughter of the overseas Chinese woman Ye Jinniang, who was killed by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia, today indignantly denounced the bloody atrocities of the West Java military authorities at a rally held by students in Tianjin.
    Yesterday, Lin Xiulan was engrossed in studying the innovation project of the automatic production line with factory workers and technicians at the Tianjin Tractor Factory construction site. Just as she was happily celebrating the new innovation results, the unfortunate news of the killing of her mother, Ye Jinniang, and her grand-aunt, Yang Mumei, arrived. This bolt from the blue caused Lin Xiulan extreme grief. The workers and classmates were all filled with righteous indignation. While comforting Lin Xiulan, they expressed their firm protest against the bloody atrocities of the West Java military authorities.
    At a rally held today by more than 3,000 students in Tianjin, Lin Xiulan accused, "I want to accuse the West Java military authorities, under the instigation and support of powerful groups in Indonesia, of the brutal crime of killing my dear mother, Ye Jinniang, and grand-aunt, Yang Mumei, for no reason, to all peace-loving people in the world." She said, my mother and grand-aunt were law-abiding overseas Chinese women. They were shot and killed by the West Java military authorities. What crime did they commit?
    Lin Xiulan said that most of the overseas Chinese residing in Cimahi, including my mother, are hardworking laborers who have lived in Indonesia for generations. They have contributed their strength to the prosperity of the Indonesian economy and have fought side by side with the Indonesian people against Dutch colonialism and Japanese militarism. Now, however, powerful groups in Indonesia are persecuting overseas Chinese in every possible way, even shooting and killing our relatives. And now they are trying every possible way to deny and evade responsibility for the murder. I demand that the Indonesian government, in accordance with the protest of our Ambassador Huang Zhen, severely punish the murderers, offer compensation to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese compatriots, immediately stop all activities of persecuting overseas Chinese, and guarantee the safety of my family and the lives and property of all overseas Chinese.
    This morning, Shi Hengle, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Office of Hebei Province, Li Guangchen, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation of Hebei Province, Yang Teng, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of Tianjin, and Liao Canhui, Chairman of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation of Tianjin, and others expressed their condolences to Lin Xiulan.

    叶金娘的女儿林秀兰控诉西爪哇军事当局暴行
    据新华社天津6日电　被印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害的华侨妇女叶金娘的女儿、天津大学学生林秀兰，今天在天津市学生举行的集会上悲愤控诉西爪哇军事当局的血腥暴行。
    昨天，林秀兰正在天津拖拉机厂工地和工厂工人、技术人员聚精会神地研究着生产自动线的革新项目，就在她兴高采烈地庆贺新的革新成果的时候，传来了她母亲叶金娘和她的叔祖母杨木妹被杀害的不幸消息。这一晴天霹雳，使林秀兰悲痛欲绝。工人和同学们个个义愤填膺，他们一面安慰林秀兰，一面表示坚决抗议西爪哇军事当局的血腥暴行。
    在今天天津市三千多名学生举行的集会上，林秀兰控诉说：“我要向全世界爱好和平的人民控诉西爪哇军事当局在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动和支持下，无端害杀我亲爱的母亲叶金娘和叔祖母杨木妹的残暴罪行。”她说，我的母亲和叔祖母都是安分守己的华侨妇女，她们竟被西爪哇军事当局开枪杀害，她们究竟有什么罪过？
    林秀兰说，我的母亲和居住在芝马圩的华侨，绝大多数是侨居印度尼西亚几代的辛勤劳动者，他们在繁荣印度尼西亚经济方面贡献了自己的力量，并曾经和印度尼西亚人民一起并肩反抗过荷兰殖民主义者和日本军国主义者，而现在，印度尼西亚有势力集团却百般迫害华侨，甚至枪杀我们的亲人。而且现在他们却百般抵赖，企图逃避杀人罪责。我要求印度尼西亚政府根据我国黄镇大使的抗议，严惩凶手，抚恤受难者家属，立即释放被捕华侨同胞，立即停止一切迫害华侨的活动，保证我的家庭以及全体华侨生命、财产的安全。
    今天上午，河北省华侨事务委员会办公室副主任石恒乐、河北省归国华侨联合会筹备委员会主任委员李广臣、天津市华侨事务委员会副主任杨腾、天津市归国华侨联合会主席廖灿辉等对林秀兰进行了慰问。
