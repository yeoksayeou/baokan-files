One Car Does the Work of Three

In Moscow, there is an ordinary automobile transportation team with three drivers. These three work on one car, making one car do the work of three.

In the past, the auto transport company's cars were operated on a single-shift basis, with only one driver per car. After the driver worked eight hours, he rested, and the car remained idle until the next day.

"Is this reasonable? No, a car, like all machines, should work non-stop and not be idle." Last spring, automobile driver and Communist Party member Vasily Nozdrjovatikh was thinking this way. At a meeting of the auto transport company, Nozdrjovatikh put forward his idea. He said: "Our company's transportation tasks will double during the Seven-Year Plan. To complete this task, do we need to double the number of cars? I don't think so. We can completely exceed the transportation plan by one time without increasing the number of cars, as long as we double the actual working time of the cars."

Nozdrjovatikh's suggestion was this: equip each car with three drivers so that the car can travel on the road for nineteen to twenty hours every twenty-four hours. Once he said this, everyone present understood! If all the existing cars in the transport company were changed to a three-shift system, then the potential that could be tapped would be enormous.

Nozdrjovatikh established the first three-shift crew. His teammates were Klimanov and Yepifantsev.

Not only during the day, but also at night, the powerful "MAZ-200" trucks could be seen traveling on the road. At first, they only towed one trailer, but later they towed two. This united and friendly team of truck drivers participated in the competition to win the title of Communist Labor Team. They not only wanted to increase the amount of transportation every day, but also cared about maintaining their cars. All three of them are first-class drivers, and they do some necessary minor repairs themselves. When carrying out essential technical maintenance, they personally supervise the maintenance work to ensure that the entire maintenance work is done as well as possible.

Fifteen months have passed since working in the new way. The result of the work is that the utilization factor of the three-shift team's car reached 0.966, exceeding the utilization factor stipulated to be achieved at the end of the Seven-Year Plan. The car travels on the road for 19.5 hours, with a daily mileage of 500 kilometers.

Nozdrjovatikh's initiative has been greatly promoted. Now, the First Branch of the Moscow Building Materials Transport Corporation, where this initiative was born, has 82 cars with three drivers, and there are 250 three-shift car crews in Moscow.

After learning from their experience, Moscow automobile transport workers have guaranteed that not only will they not increase the number of cars, but they will also free up more than 3,000 cars from the capital to be handed over to other regions for use. From this, it can be seen that Nozdrjovatikh and these ordinary workers have made no small contribution. (Ka'erpingkefu)

### 一辆汽车顶三辆用

    一辆汽车顶三辆用
    莫斯科有一个普通的汽车运输小组，这个小组有三个司机。他们三个人在一辆汽车上工作，并且使一辆汽车顶三辆汽车用。
    在过去，汽车运输公司的汽车都是做的一班工作，每一辆汽车只有一个司机。司机工作八小时以后休息了，车也就一直闲到第二天。
    “这样合理吗？不，汽车也和所有的机器一样，应当不停地工作，不应该闲着。”在去年春季，汽车司机、共产党员华西里·诺兹德列瓦迪赫就这样考虑着。在汽车运输公司的一次会议上，诺兹德列瓦迪赫提出了自己的想法。他说：“我们公司的运输任务在七年计划期间将要增长一倍。为了完成这个任务，是否需要增加一倍的汽车呢？我认为不需要，我们完全可以不增加汽车就超额一倍完成运输计划，只要把汽车实际工作的时间延长一倍就行了。”
    诺兹德列瓦迪赫的建议是这样的：每一辆汽车上配三个司机，使汽车每昼夜在线路上行驶的时间达到十九—二十小时。经他一说，到会的人都明白了！如果把运输公司现有的汽车都改为三班制工作的话，那么能发掘出来的潜力是极大的。
    诺兹德列瓦迪赫建立了第一个三班制乘务组。和他同组的是克里曼诺夫和叶皮芳采夫。
    不仅是白天，就是黑夜也能看到强大的“马斯—200”型汽车行驶在公路上。开始的时候只挂一辆拖车，后来挂上了两辆。这个团结友爱的汽车司机小组参加了争取共产主义劳动队称号的竞赛，他们不仅一心要使运输量天天提高，而且还关心保养自己的汽车。他们三个人都是一级司机，一些必需的小修，他们都自己做，在进行非做不可的技术维修的时候，他们亲自监督维修工作，让整个维修工作做得尽可能好。
    自从按照新方式工作以来，已经过去十五个月了。工作的结果是：三班制小组的汽车利用系数达到了零点九六六，超过了规定在七年计划末达到的利用系数。汽车在线路上行驶的时间为十九点五小时，每昼夜行驶里程为五百公里。
    诺兹德列瓦迪赫的创举得到了极大的推广。现在诞生这一创举的莫斯科建筑材料运输总公司第一分公司，已经有八十二台汽车有三个司机，全莫斯科市则有二百五十个三班倒的汽车乘务组。
    莫斯科汽车运输工作者在学习了他们的经验后，保证不仅不增加汽车，而且还要从首都腾出三千多辆汽车，把这些汽车交给其他地区使用。从这里可以看出，诺兹德列瓦迪赫这些普通劳动者有着不小的功绩。（卡尔平科夫）
