　　Today is the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Indochina. Faced with the unstable situation in Indochina today, reviewing the continuous violations of the Geneva Agreements over the past six years, all peace-loving people can clearly see that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of peace in Indochina and the number one enemy of world peace. To achieve world peace, people all over the world must wage a tit-for-tat united struggle against the imperialist war forces headed by the United States.

　　The signing of the 1954 Geneva Agreements was of great significance for guaranteeing peace in Indochina and Asia. The basic spirit of the Geneva Agreements is to seek a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue based on respect for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries. The signing of this agreement not only extinguished the flames of war in Indochina, restored peace in Indochina, and enabled the people of Indochina to build their beautiful homelands, but also provided another example for the peaceful resolution of international disputes. The Geneva Agreements were therefore unanimously supported by peace-loving people all over the world and the people of Indochina.

　　For six years, thanks to the joint efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of Indochina, and many related countries and peoples, the Geneva Agreements have been partially implemented in Indochina, playing a positive role in maintaining peace in the Indochina region. However, the facts of the past six years clearly tell people that although there are international peace agreements, it cannot be said that the people of Indochina can sit back and relax from now on. It's impossible to completely trust imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and therefore there is no need to wage an arduous struggle against imperialism. On the contrary, the Geneva Agreements have been continuously undermined by U.S. imperialism. Precisely because of this, since the ceasefire in Indochina, the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Vietnam and throughout Indochina has always been filled with a serious struggle between two paths: maintaining the Geneva Agreements and undermining the Geneva Agreements; peace in Indochina has been in an unstable state.

　　Although the United States participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference, and the U.S. representative, Undersecretary of State Smith, also made a promise at the Geneva Conference that the United States would not use threats or force to hinder the Geneva Agreements; U.S. imperialism has tried every means to undermine it from the day the Geneva Agreements were signed. The day after the Geneva Agreements were signed, U.S. President Eisenhower brazenly announced that the United States was not bound by the decisions of the Geneva Conference. The United States then cobbled together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in early September of the same year. Through this aggressive military bloc or by itself, it has stepped up its blatant military and political interference and subversive activities against the Indochinese countries. The United States first controlled South Vietnam as a bridgehead for its aggression against Indochina. For six years, U.S. imperialism has supported its puppet Ngo Dinh Diem clique, wantonly destroying the Geneva Agreements, shipping thousands of military personnel and hundreds of thousands of tons of military supplies into South Vietnam, and expanding and building more than fifty strategic air force bases and naval bases in South Vietnam. In order to provide cannon fodder for the United States' aggressive war, a huge army has been established in South Vietnam under the training, organization, and equipment of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group." According to figures released by the South Vietnamese authorities, the total number of troops that can be conscripted in South Vietnam (including active army, military police, "security forces," "civil guard," and reserve forces) reaches 470,000. Recently, the United States has also attempted to illegally transport more military personnel to South Vietnam under the pretext of "rotating" personnel from the French "Expeditionary Force" that had already withdrawn and should have withdrawn from Vietnam, and has intensified its instructions to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to carry out bloody suppression and massacres of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam. At the same time, the United States has also used "aid" to strangle South Vietnam's national economy. Thus, the fact that the United States is plotting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into its military base and colony has blocked the path for North and South Vietnam to achieve peaceful reunification in accordance with the Geneva Agreements.

　　While occupying South Vietnam, the United States also extended its aggressive claws to Laos. It not only used economic and political pressure to force the Phouma cabinet, which was negotiating cooperation with the former Laotian combat forces in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, to resign; but also instigated pro-American elements in Laos to openly violate the Geneva Agreements, provoke a civil war in Laos, and violently prevent the International Commission for Laos, which was responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos, from continuing its activities. The United States attempts to use South Vietnam and Laos to build a circle of encirclement against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia, and to threaten China's southern border. As for the U.S. interference and subversion plots against the Kingdom of Cambodia, which insists on pursuing a peaceful and neutral policy, they are well known. All facts prove that U.S. imperialism is frantically hostile to the national independence, peace, and security of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It is U.S. imperialism that has painstakingly undermined the Geneva Agreements on Indochina and seriously threatens peace in Indochina and the Far East. U.S. imperialism is the culprit in destroying the Geneva Agreements and the most ferocious enemy of peace in Indochina and the national independence of the Indochinese countries.

　　The facts that have occurred in Indochina over the past six years highlight who wants peace and who does not. Can it be said that the people of Indochina, who have shed blood and sacrificed for the independence of their motherland and fought bravely for nearly a century, do not cherish peace? Of course not. The people of Indochina, like the people of all countries in the world, infinitely cherish the independence and peace they have won. However, it is precisely the U.S. imperialists from across the ocean who have stretched their black hands into this beautiful peninsula from thousands of miles away, threatening peace in the region and trying to strangle their independence. Therefore, faced with the U.S. imperialists' aggression and criminal activities of undermining peace in Indochina, the people of Indochina have launched a struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This is inevitable and precisely in order to effectively safeguard peace in Indochina.

　　U.S. imperialism is doing its best to undermine the Geneva international agreements on Indochina, and its countless crimes of undermining peace in Indochina and opposing the national independence of the Indochinese countries are an important part of its policy of war and aggression in Asia and even the world. In Asia, U.S. imperialism is constantly threatening the independence, peace, and security of Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization. U.S. imperialism continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, occupies the southern part of Korea, and, in particular, spares no effort to revive Japanese militarist forces, driving Japan to act as its vanguard in launching new wars in the Far East. In Africa and Latin America, U.S. imperialism has never stopped its aggression. It is precisely because U.S. imperialism is doing bad things everywhere in the world that it has been opposed by all peace-loving and independence-cherishing people of all countries in the world. Therefore, the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of peace in Indochina is by no means isolated. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, the just struggles of the people of the world support each other. The struggle of Vietnam and the people of Indochina against U.S. imperialism is a great support for the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and a major contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. And the rise of a worldwide storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina against U.S. imperialism. Currently, North Vietnam is unfolding a massive mass movement against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique. This movement fully embodies the great determination of the entire Vietnamese people to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and resolutely demand the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world against imperialism, to safeguard and strive for national independence, and to defend world peace. China and Vietnam are close neighbors who are as interdependent as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. The people of China and Vietnam also have a fighting friendship forged in the long-term struggle against imperialism. In the socialist construction of the two countries, the people of China and Vietnam are working together under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, constantly strengthening our unity and fraternal friendship. The Chinese people undoubtedly fully support the movement that the Vietnamese people are carrying out throughout the country against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. On the afternoon of July 19, people from all walks of life in our capital solemnly held a mass rally to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, expressing the unwavering will of the 650 million Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people. At the same time, as a participant in the Geneva Conference on Indochina, the Chinese people are particularly concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Indochina and the independence, peace, and security of the Indochinese countries. Based on the consistent position of upholding the Geneva Agreements and guaranteeing peace in Indochina, the Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs tearing up the Geneva Agreements and undermining the criminal activities of peace in Indochina; and deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Indochina against U.S. imperialism. On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Agreements, the Chinese people reiterate this firm position and resolutely and unremittingly fight together with the people of Indochina and the people of the world to uphold the Geneva Agreements and defend peace in Indochina and Asia. U.S. imperialism must completely and thoroughly get out of South Vietnam and get out of Asia! Only in this way can the peace of Indochina and Asia be effectively guaranteed.

### 坚决为维护印度支那的和平而斗争

　　坚决为维护印度支那的和平而斗争
    今天是有关印度支那问题的日内瓦协议签订六周年纪念日。面临着今天印度支那不稳定的局势，回顾六年来日内瓦协议不断遭到破坏的情况，一切爱好和平的人们都能清楚地看到，美帝国主义是印度支那和平的头号敌人，也是世界和平的头号敌人；为要取得世界和平，全世界人民必须同以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力进行针锋相对的联合斗争。
    1954年日内瓦协议的签订，对于保障印度支那和亚洲和平具有十分重大的意义。日内瓦协议的基本精神是在尊重印度支那各国人民的主权、独立与领土完整的基础上，求得印度支那问题的和平解决。这个协议的签订，不仅扑灭了印度支那的战火，恢复了印度支那的和平，使得印度支那各国人民有可能建设自己美好的祖国；而且为和平解决国际争端提供了又一个范例。日内瓦协议因此获得了全世界爱好和平的人民和印度支那各国人民的一致拥护。
    六年来，由于越南民主共和国、印度支那各国人民以及许多有关国家和人民的共同努力，日内瓦协议在印度支那得到了部分的实施，对维护印度支那地区的和平起了积极的作用。然而，过去六年的事实清楚地告诉人们，尽管有了国际和平协议，但决不能说，印度支那各国人民从此就高枕无忧了，可以对帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义完全放心，因而不需要对帝国主义进行艰巨的斗争了。事实恰恰相反，日内瓦协议不断遭到美帝国主义的破坏。正由于此，印度支那停战以来，日内瓦协议在越南和整个印度支那的实施，始终充满了维护日内瓦协议和破坏日内瓦协议的两条道路的严重斗争；印度支那的和平一直处于不稳定的状态中。
    虽然美国参加了1954年的日内瓦会议，而美国的代表、副国务卿史密斯也在日内瓦会议上作出了关于美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害日内瓦协议的诺言；但美帝国主义从日内瓦协议签订的那一天起，就千方百计地对它进行破坏。还在日内瓦协议签订的第二天，美国总统艾森豪威尔便悍然宣布美国不受日内瓦会议的决定的约束。美国随即在同年9月初拼凑起东南亚条约组织。它通过这个侵略性军事集团或者由自己出头，步步加紧对印度支那国家进行露骨的军事、政治干涉和颠复活动。美国首先控制越南南方作为它侵略印度支那的桥头堡。六年来，美帝国主义扶植它的走狗吴庭艳集团，恣意破坏日内瓦协议，向越南南方运进了成千名军事人员和数以十万吨计的军用物资，并且在越南南方扩建和新建了五十多个战略空军基地和海军基地。为了替美国提供侵略战争的炮灰，在“美国军事援助顾问团”的训练、组织和美国武器的装备下，一支庞大的军队已经在越南南方建立起来。根据越南南方当局公布的数字，越南南方可以征召的兵力（包括现役陆军、军事警察、“保安团”、“民卫团”、预备兵力）总数达到四十七万人。最近美国还企图以“轮换”早已撤出和应该撤出越南的法国“远征军”人员为名，向越南南方非法输送更多的军事人员，并且加紧指使吴庭艳集团对越南南方的前抗战人员和爱国人民实行血腥镇压和屠杀。同时，美国还利用“援助”绞杀了越南南方的民族经济。这样，美国阴谋长期分割越南以及把越南南方变成它的军事基地和殖民地的事实，就堵塞了越南南北双方根据日内瓦协议实现和平统一的道路。
    美国在霸占越南南方的同时，又把侵略魔掌伸向老挝。它不仅运用经济和政治压力，迫使根据日内瓦协议同前寮国战斗部队谈判合作的富马内阁辞职；而且唆使老挝亲美分子公然毁弃日内瓦协议、挑起老挝内战，横暴阻止负责监察和监督日内瓦协议在老挝的实施的老挝国际委员会继续活动。美国企图利用越南南方和老挝筑成对越南民主共和国和柬埔寨王国的包围圈，并且威胁中国的南疆。至于美国对坚持奉行和平中立政策的柬埔寨王国所进行的干涉和颠复阴谋，则是尽人皆知的。一切事实都证明，美帝国主义疯狂地敌视越南、老挝和柬埔寨的民族独立、和平与安全。正是美国帝国主义，它处心积虑地破坏关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议，严重地威胁印度支那和远东的和平。美帝国主义是破坏日内瓦协议的罪魁祸首，是印度支那和平和印度支那各国民族独立的最凶恶的敌人。
    六年来印度支那发生的事实突出地说明了谁要和平，谁不要和平。难道可以说，为自己祖国的独立流血牺牲，英勇奋斗了近一个世纪的印度支那各国人民不珍视和平吗？当然不是的。印度支那各国人民和世界各国人民一样，是无限地珍视他们所争得的独立与和平的。但是，正是远隔重洋的美帝国主义者从万里之外把黑手伸进这个美丽的半岛，而威胁着这个地区的和平，并且要扼杀它们的独立。因此，面对着美帝国主义的侵略和破坏印度支那和平的罪恶活动，印度支那各国人民掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，这是不可避免的，而且正是为了有效地维护印度支那和平。
    美帝国主义竭力破坏关于印度支那问题的日内瓦国际协议，破坏印度支那的和平与反对印度支那各国民族独立的罄竹难书的罪行，是它在亚洲以至全世界推行战争政策和侵略政策的一个重要组成部分。美帝国主义在亚洲利用着东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织不断地威胁着东南亚和中近东各国的独立、和平与安全。美帝国主义继续霸占着中国的领土台湾，霸占着朝鲜的南部，特别是不遗余力地复活日本军国主义势力，驱使日本充当它在远东发动新战争的急先锋。在非洲、在拉丁美洲，美帝国主义也从来没有停止过它的侵略活动。正是由于美帝国主义在全世界范围内到处在做坏事，所以它遭到了全世界一切爱好和平与珍视民族独立的各国人民的反对。因此，越南人民和印度支那各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和维护印度支那和平的斗争，决不是孤立的。正如毛泽东主席所说的，全世界人民的正义斗争，都是相互支持的。越南和印度支那各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是对全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的一个很大的支持，是对亚洲和全世界的和平事业的一个重大贡献。而一个世界性的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴的兴起，则为越南人民和印度支那各国人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争，创造了空前有利的条件。现在，越南北方正在展开着声势浩大的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的群众运动，这个运动充分体现了全越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略，坚决要求祖国和平统一的伟大决心。
    中国人民坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民反对帝国主义、维护和争取民族独立、保卫世界和平的斗争。中国和越南是唇齿相依、安危与共的近邻。中越两国人民又有着在长期的反对帝国主义斗争中结成的战斗友谊。而在两国的社会主义建设事业中，中越两国人民又在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下共策共力，不断地加强了我们的团结和兄弟般的友谊。中国人民毫无疑问地全力支持越南人民正在全国范围内开展的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的运动。7月19日下午，我国首都各界人民隆重举行了支持越南人民正义斗争的群众大会，表达了六亿五千万中国人民支持越南人民的不可动摇的意志。同时，作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国，中国人民尤其关心日内瓦协议在印度支那的实施和印度支那各国的独立、和平与安全。本着维护日内瓦协议和保障印度支那和平的一贯立场，中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗撕毁日内瓦协议和破坏印度支那和平的罪恶活动；并深切同情和坚决支持印度支那各国人民的反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。值此日内瓦协议签订六周年之际，中国人民重申这一坚定不移的立场，坚决地、不懈地同印度支那各国人民，同全世界人民一道，为维护日内瓦协议，保卫印度支那和亚洲的和平而斗争。美帝国主义必须全部彻底地滚出越南南方，滚出亚洲去！只有这样，才能切实保障印度支那和亚洲的和平。
