Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 13th. Following the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution in Shanghai's industrial front this spring, Shanghai has closely integrated the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of technical innovation, and has also widely launched a mass competition activity of "every innovation bears fruit, everyone strives to do the work of several," to fully implement the general line's requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

As early as the beginning of May, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the development trend of the technical revolution movement, summarized the strong desire of the broad masses to accelerate socialist construction, and put forward the following battle call to the city's workers: Let innovation projects blossom and continue to bear fruit, strive to use one person instead of several, one material instead of several, one factory instead of several, one product instead of several, and achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year. After this call was issued, it immediately received a warm response from millions of workers in the city. The "one instead of several" competition quickly unfolded throughout the city, and the forms were diverse and the content was rich and colorful, with more and more units and individuals achieving "one instead of several." According to statistics from relevant departments in late June, among the eighty-seven heavy industrial factories in Putuo District, sixty factories had achieved the goal of one factory instead of two to three or more factories, and one person instead of two to three or more people by mid-June. More than 80% of the factories in Nanshi District were involved in this competition, with batches of factories, workshops, teams, and individuals reaching one instead of one and a half to three.

The vigorous development of the "one instead of several" competition has played a very significant role in comprehensively fulfilling the state plan. By the end of June, a total of seven hundred and two factories in twelve districts of the city had completed and overfulfilled half of the annual plan ahead of schedule according to six major indicators.

Over the past two months, the rise and development of this competition activity have fully demonstrated that it concentrates and reflects the great achievements made by the technical revolution movement in various aspects, and greatly promotes the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of technical innovation; and the continuous improvement of the degree of "four modernizations", the widespread application of new technologies, new processes, and new equipment, the reform of old products and the trial production of new products, and the general development of comprehensive utilization of resources have opened up broad prospects for the realization of "one instead of several." Xu Donghai, an old worker at the Shanghai Lightning Arrester Factory, boldly abolished the old process, adopted new materials, and successfully trial-produced a new type of lightning arrester, which comprehensively achieved one person instead of three, one material instead of four, one factory instead of three, and one product instead of dozens or hundreds of products, while also reducing costs by 80%. Wang Shuzhen, a first-grade female lathe operator at the Qiu Xin Shipyard, used to often fail to complete her plan; in the upsurge of the technical revolution, she worked hard to catch up with Wang Juanjuan, the national advanced producer in the same workshop. She applied thirty-five innovation projects to the belt lathe she operated, used eight advanced tools and ten new technologies, and finally increased labor productivity by four times, jumping into the ranks of the advanced.

In order to realize "everyone strives to do the work of several," it is necessary to ensure that "every innovation bears fruit." Workers in the heat treatment section of the seventh workshop of the Shanghai Motor Factory carried out the activities of "calculate, compare, check, and think" in the "one instead of several" competition, comprehensively reviewed technical innovation projects, and organized forces to tackle key problems, so that all one hundred and twenty-five technical innovation projects in the entire section blossomed and bore fruit. When the Pliers Team of Zhou Shunchang Machine Factory launched the competition, some young people were still skeptical; later, after a discussion, they found that some new equipment had not yet been put into production, some innovation projects were not yet perfect, and the production potential was still great. After learning from the advanced, finding tricks, and everyone participating in the work of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, the twenty-one innovation projects put into production were "taken to the next level," and some innovation projects that had been considered impossible to achieve due to repeated failures were also realized; at the same time, many technical revolution "new worlds" that had not been explored in the past were also discovered. As a result, each member of the team achieved one instead of three and a half, achieving a double harvest of innovation and production.

In the "one instead of several" competition, the Shanghai working class demonstrated a heroic spirit and a noble style. A large number of outstanding pacesetters who achieved "one instead of several" are having an increasingly profound impact on the broad masses of workers. Yu Zhida, a young worker at the Kepei Instrument Factory, made the ambitious aspiration of "competing with imperialism in science and technology," boldly jumped out of the imitation circle, and successfully created the Chinese-style advanced instrument "multi-purpose high-temperature calibration instrument," achieving one person instead of three, one material instead of four, and one product instead of six. His advanced ideas and advanced deeds, after being summarized and widely publicized by the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, immediately set off a "learn from Yu Zhida, strive to do the work of several" upsurge among the young workers in the city. Everywhere, there appeared Yu Zhida-style pioneers who broke with conventions, eliminated superstition, boldly created, and fiercely attacked the cutting edge.

While further improving their leadership style and leadership methods, and strengthening political and ideological work, the leading cadres of many factories and enterprises also seized the important link of carrying out the "one instead of several" competition, and organically combined the comprehensive grasp of production, the grasp of the technical revolution, and the implementation of the combination of work and rest, achieving "immediate results." The task of the Second Workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory was heavier in May, and the cadres were busy grasping production and did not seriously grasp the technical revolution, which affected the completion of the task; the Party branch conducted a special study on this situation, and introduced the experience of the second team in this workshop, which was able to complete the task every day, implemented the monthly and weekly plans to each machine and each person, and mobilized the workers to conscientiously promote advanced tools, advanced technology, and advanced technology, as a result, not only completed the task of that month, but also had new developments in the technical revolution. The Party branch of the Second Metalworking Workshop of the Shanghai Hoisting and Transportation Machinery Factory took the development of the "one instead of several" competition as the guideline, fully mobilized the masses, and greatly enhanced the confidence in achieving "one instead of several" by talking about the situation, assigning tasks, and carefully calculating accounts; then, it introduced to the workers the deeds of a lathe operator in this workshop who achieved "one instead of several" by giving play to subjective initiative and adopting new technology, and established a pacesetter; at the same time, the workshop director and foreman worked and discussed with the workers to solve problems in a down-to-earth manner in production. After doing so, every worker in the entire workshop had innovation projects, advanced tools were generally used, achieving one person instead of two or more, and better implementing the combination of work and rest.

At present, many factories and enterprises in Shanghai are continuing to revolve around the requirements of "one instead of several" and "first-class," further mobilizing the masses, widely establishing advanced pacesetters, uniformly arranging work, and striving to create greater and more outstanding achievements in the second half of the year.

　　一人顶几人　一厂顶几厂　一份材料顶几份材料
    上海一批工厂实现“一顶几”
　　七百多个工厂按六大指标提前完成了全年计划一半
    新华社上海13日电　上海工业战线继今春掀起技术革新技术革命高潮之后，密切结合技术革新成果的巩固、推广、提高工作，又广泛展开了“条条革新结满果，人人力争一顶几”的群众竞赛活动，全面贯彻总路线的多快好省要求。
    中共上海市委早在5月初就根据技术革命运动的发展趋势，概括了广大群众加速建设社会主义的强烈愿望，向全市职工提出了以下的战斗号召：让革新项目普遍开花结果、不断开花结果，极力争取一个人顶几个人用，一份材料顶几份材料用，一厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用，实现今年更好更全面的跃进。这一号召发出之后，立即得到全市百万职工的热烈响应，“一顶几”的竞赛活动迅速在全市范围内展开，而且形式多种多样，内容丰富多彩，出现了越来越多的实现“一顶几”的单位和个人。据有关部门6月下旬的统计，普陀区八十七家重工业工厂中，6月中旬已有六十家工厂实现了一个厂顶两个到三个以上的厂、一个人顶两个到三个以上的人的目标。南市区80％以上的工厂投入了这项竞赛，达到一顶一个半到三的工厂、车间、小组和个人，成批出现。
      “一顶几”竞赛活动的蓬勃发展，对于全面完成国家计划起了极其显著的作用。全市十二个区到6月下旬为止，共有七百零二家工厂，按照六大指标提前完成和超额完成了全年计划的一半。
  两个月来，这项竞赛活动的兴起和发展情况充分表明：它集中反映了技术革命运动在各个方面所取得的巨大成果，大大促进了技术革新成果的巩固、推广、提高工作；而“四化”程度的不断提高，新技术、新工艺、新设备的广泛应用，老产品改革和新产品试制以及资源综合利用的普遍发展，又为实现“一顶几”开拓了广阔的前途。上海避雷器厂老工人徐东海大胆废除旧工艺，采用新材料，试制成功一种新型避雷器，一举而全面实现了一个人顶三个人用，一份材料顶四份材料用，一个厂顶三个厂用，一件产品顶几十、几百件产品用，成本也降低了80％。求新造船厂一级女车工王淑珍，过去常常完不成计划；在技术革命高潮中她发奋图强，猛赶同车间的全国先进生产者王娟娟，在自己操作的皮带车床上运用了三十五项革新项目，使用了八把先进刀具、十项新技术，终于提高劳动生产率四倍，跃入先进行列。
    为了实现“人人力争一顶几”，就必须使“条条革新结满果”。上海电机厂七车间热处理工段工人，在“一顶几”竞赛中开展了“算一算，比一比，查一查，想一想”的活动，全面复查技术革新项目，组织力量攻关键，使全工段一百二十五个技术革新项目，条条开满花结满果。周顺昌机器厂钳工团小组在竞赛开展的时候，部分青年还有些怀疑；后来一讨论，就发现有些新设备还没有投入生产，有些革新项目还不完善，生产潜力还很大。经过学先进，找窍门，人人参加巩固、推广和提高的工作，从而使投入生产的二十一项革新项目“更上一层楼”，一些由于屡次失败而被认为无法实现的革新项目也实现了；同时，还发现了不少过去没有涉猎到的技术革命“新天地”。结果，全组每个人都做到一顶三个半，取得了革新、生产的双丰收。
    在“一顶几”竞赛活动中，上海工人阶级表现了豪迈的气概和崇高的风格。大批实现“一顶几”的出色标兵，在广大工人群众中产生着越来越深远的影响。科培仪器厂青年工人于志达，立下“在科学技术上同帝国主义较量一番”的雄心大志，大胆跳出仿造圈子，创制成功中国式高级仪器“多用高温校验仪”，做到人工一顶三，材料一顶四，产品一顶六。他的先进思想和先进事迹，经过共青团市委的总结和广泛宣传，顿时就在全市青年工人中掀起了一个“学赶于志达，力争一顶几”的热潮，到处出现了打破陈规、破除迷信、大胆创造、猛攻尖端的于志达式的闯将。
    许多工厂企业的领导干部在进一步改进领导作风和领导方法，加强政治思想工作的同时，也抓住开展“一顶几”竞赛这一重要环节，把全面抓生产、抓技术革命和贯彻劳逸结合等有机地结合起来，取得了“立竿见影”的效果。上海机床厂二车间5月份任务较重，干部忙于抓生产，没有认真抓技术革命，因而影响到任务的完成；党支部针对这一情况进行了专门研究，并且介绍了这个车间第二小组天天都能完成任务的经验，把月度和一周的计划落实到每个机台和每个人，发动职工认真推行了先进刀具、先进工艺和先进技术，结果不仅完成了当月的任务，技术革命也有了新的发展。上海起重运输机械厂第二金工车间党支部以开展“一顶几”竞赛为纲，充分发动群众，通过谈形势、交任务、算细账，大大增强了实现“一顶几”的信心；然后又向职工介绍了本车间一个车工由于发挥主观能动性，采用新技术而达到
  “一顶几”的事迹，树立了标兵；同时，车间主任、工段长又同工人一道劳动，一道商量，一道解决问题，扎扎实实地在生产中领导生产。这样做以后，全车间每个工人都有革新项目，先进刀具得到了普遍使用，实现了一个人顶二个人以上，更好地贯彻了劳逸结合。
    目前，上海的许多工厂企业都在继续围绕“一顶几”和“第一流”的要求，进一步发动群众，广树先进标兵，统一安排工作，力争在下半年创造更大更出色的成绩。（附图片）
