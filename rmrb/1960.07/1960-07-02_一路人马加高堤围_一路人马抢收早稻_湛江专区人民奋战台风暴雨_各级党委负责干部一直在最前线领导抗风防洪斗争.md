Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th – Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, have been urgently mobilized to wage a fierce battle to overcome the attack of typhoons and rainstorms.

The third typhoon of this year landed in Huangpi, Huazhou County, Guangdong Province, at 3:00 AM this morning. After landing, the typhoon swept across Zhanjiang and Suixi, reaching the Beibu Gulf, passed through Weizhou Island at 5:00 PM, approached Jiangping, and will enter northern North Vietnam tonight. The wind force at the typhoon center in Beibu Gulf reached level 8 to 9, while the wind force outside the typhoon center was generally level 6 to 7, and the sea wind force was level 7 to 8. The typhoon brought heavy rain. Leinan County received the most rainfall in the south, and flash floods have caused waterlogging in some areas.

Before the typhoon arrived, all counties in Zhanjiang Prefecture had organized forces to rush to harvest the ripe early rice. When the typhoon and rainstorm hit, leading comrades and all cadres of the CPC Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee and Party committees at all levels in the region rushed to the front line of the fight against wind and flood, leading the masses to fight against the typhoon and rainstorm. Meng Xiande, First Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and Mo Huai, Secretary and Commissioner, rushed to Liangyang, Dianbai, and Huazhou counties, where the wind force was stronger, last night to participate in and lead the battle against wind and to rush the harvest. Sun Zhengshu, First Secretary of the Liangyang County Party Committee, rushed back to Rudong Commune from Zhanjiang at 10:00 PM last night and immediately led more than 1,000 workers to rush to repair water conservancy projects with a drainage and irrigation area of over 10,000 mu. When a dangerous situation appeared on the embankment of the Youth Canal, Zhao Liman, First Secretary of the Leibei County Party Committee, and Secretary Chen Huarong, as well as nine members of the County Party Committee, took the lead and rushed to the dangerous section for emergency repairs. They led more than 300 shock team members and 9,000 workers, soldiers, and office cadres, and worked hard to repair the embankment, finally turning the crisis into safety.

Before the typhoon landed, all counties in Zhanjiang Prefecture organized two groups of people: one group to raise and thicken the dikes to strengthen the defenses, and the other group to urgently harvest the ripe early rice to seize grain from the wind. According to statistics from five counties including Liangyang, Dianbai, Leinan, Huazhou, and Dongxing, there were more than 420,000 mu of ripe early rice, and 370,000 mu had already been harvested on the 29th. At the same time, various localities also organized forces to strengthen the wind protection work of economic crops.

In the struggle against wind and flood, all relevant departments are doing their best to provide support. The transportation department has dispatched trains to transport workers to the Youth Canal Reservoir construction site to prevent danger, and has delivered flood control materials such as timber, grass bags, and sack bags needed by various construction sites overnight. The health department has also organized rescue teams to go to the disaster areas to carry out rescue work.

    一路人马加高堤围　一路人马抢收早稻
    湛江专区人民奋战台风暴雨
    各级党委负责干部一直在最前线领导抗风防洪斗争
    新华社广州30日电　广东省湛江专区人民在党的领导下已经紧急动员起来，为战胜台风和暴雨的袭击展开了一场激烈的战斗。
    今年第三号台风已于今晨三时在广东省化州县黄陂登陆。台风登陆后，掠过湛江、遂溪，到达合浦海面，下午五时穿过涠洲岛，靠近江平，今晚将进入越南民主共和国北部。在合浦的台风中心风力达到八至九级，台风中心以外地区的风力，一般为六至七级，海面风力为七至八级。台风带来了暴雨。雷南县南部下雨最多，部分地区由于骤降暴雨，已造成内涝灾害。
    在台风到来之前，湛江专区各县已组织了力量进行抢割已熟早稻。当台风暴雨袭来时，中共湛江地委和这个地区的各级党委领导同志和全体干部都奔赴抗风防洪的最前线，领导群众和台风暴雨搏斗。地委第一书记孟宪德，书记兼专员莫怀等，在昨天晚上分别赶到风力较大的两阳、电白和化州等县参加和领导防风抢收的战斗。两阳县委第一书记孙正述昨天晚上十时从湛江赶回儒垌公社，立即带领一千多民工抢修排灌面积万亩以上的水利工程。当青年运河的堤坝出现险情的时候，雷北县委第一书记赵立满和书记陈华荣以及九个县委委员，都身先士卒，赶往险段进行抢险，他们带领三百多个突击队员和九千个民工、战士及机关干部，奋力抢修堤围，终于转危为安。
    在台风登陆之前，湛江专区各县都组织了两套人马，一套人马加高加厚堤围，固守堤防；一套人马紧急抢收已熟早稻，与风争粮。据两阳、电白、雷南、化州、东兴等五个县统计，共有已经成熟的早稻四十二万多亩，29日已经抢收回来三十七万亩。各地还同时组织了力量加强经济作物的防风工作。
    在抗风抗洪斗争中，各有关部门都全力进行支援。交通运输部门已派出火车载运民工赶到青年运河水库工地防险，并将各工地所需要的木材、草包、麻包等防洪物资连夜送到。卫生部门也组织了救护队前往灾区进行抢救工作。
