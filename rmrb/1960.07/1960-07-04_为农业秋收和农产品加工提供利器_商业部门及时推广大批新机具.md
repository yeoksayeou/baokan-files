Providing Sharp Tools for Agricultural Autumn Harvest and Agricultural Product Processing
Commercial Departments Promptly Promote a Large Number of New Machines

    (Our report) National commercial departments are systematically and methodically promoting more than 600 technological innovation machines, tools, and advanced technical experiences. These innovation projects were selected from the National Financial and Trade Department's Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Performance Conference and then determined after repeated research by the Ministry of Commerce.
    Because the content of technological innovation in the commercial sector is rich and covers a wide range of aspects, and there are many projects to be promoted, the Ministry of Commerce has decided to adopt a batch-by-batch promotion method. The first batch will focus on promoting agricultural production materials, agricultural product purchasing, processing, comprehensive utilization of wild plants, and warehousing and transportation related to agricultural autumn harvest and post-autumn agricultural product purchasing work. This includes cotton, flue-cured tobacco, tea processing lines, cotton stalk peeling machines, cotton boll peeling machines, tobacco stalk shredding machines, wild fiber spinning machines, etc. Food and beverage service tools, which are closely related to people's lives, will also be widely promoted, such as automated staple food processing, meat cutting machines, vegetable cutting machines, dough mixers, washing machines, spin dryers, etc. These machines are being promoted to meet the needs of establishing staple food processing stations in cities and the mechanization of public canteens in urban and rural people's communes.
    Among the innovative machines and tools promoted by the commercial sector, some machines have precise structures and complex constructions, making it difficult to produce drawings. Without accurate drawings, rashly putting them into production would cause a great waste of manpower and raw materials. In order to ensure the smooth promotion of these machines, the Ministry of Commerce specially invited teachers and students from the mechanical engineering departments of some universities and colleges in Beijing and other places to specifically survey and draw these machines. Currently, more than 1,200 teachers and students from institutions such as the Beijing Institute of Technology, the Chemical Engineering Institute, the Metallurgical College, and the Liaoning Institute of Technology have drawn sketches of 143 machines for the commercial sector. They disassembled each machine, meticulously drew the drawings of each part, and then drew the general assembly drawings. These design drawings, after being corrected and copied, can be used for imitation and promotion in various places. For some machines that originally had design drawings, the Ministry of Commerce also commissioned factories to manufacture a batch of samples first for various places to imitate. For example, the Catering Service Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce has asked factories to make more than 1,400 samples of eight types of food and beverage and service machines, which have begun to be sent to various places. The complete set of equipment drawings for Zhejiang Province's crude green tea has also been finalized, and 300 sets are planned to be manufactured this year. Steel has been allocated and put into production.

    为农业秋收和农产品加工提供利器
    商业部门及时推广大批新机具
    本报讯　全国商业部门正在有计划、有步骤地推广六百多项技术革新机器、工具和先进技术经验。这些革新项目是从全国财贸部门技术革新和技术革命表演大会评选出来，又经过商业部反复研究以后确定的。
    由于商业部门技术革新的内容丰富，方面广泛，准备推广的项目很多，商业部决定采取分批推广的办法，第一批将着重推广与农业秋收和秋后农产品收购工作有关的农业生产资料、农产品收购、加工、野生植物综合利用以及仓储运输等方面的革新机器和工具，这里面有棉花、烤烟、茶叶加工一条龙，剥棉秆皮机，剥棉桃机、烟秆切丝机、野生纤维纺纱机等等。和人民生活有密切关系的饮食服务工具，也将大量推广，如主食加工自动化、切肉机、切菜机、和面机、洗衣机、甩干机等，这些机具都是适应城市建立主食加工站和城乡人民公社公共食堂机械化的需要而推广的。
    商业部门推广的革新机具中，有一部分机器结构精密、构造复杂，制图比较困难，没有准确的图纸，贸然投入生产就会造成人力和原材料的极大浪费。商业部为了保证这一部分机器的顺利推广，特地邀请了北京市和外地的一些大专学校机械系的师生，专门对这一部分机器进行测绘制图。目前已有北京工业学院、化工学院、冶金专科学校和辽宁工学院等院校的一千二百多位师生为商业部门绘制出了一百四十三项机具的草图，他们把每件机器拆开来，细致地画出了每个零件的图纸，然后又画出总装备图，这批设计图经过校正、复制后，就可以供各地仿制和推广。有一部分原先就有设计图纸的机器，商业部还委托工厂先制造出一批样品，供各地仿制，如商业部饮食服务局已经请工厂做出了八种饮食、服务机具的样品共一千四百多台，开始发往各地；浙江省粗制绿茶的全套设备的图纸也已确定，今年准备制造三百多套，目前已拨出钢材，投入生产。
