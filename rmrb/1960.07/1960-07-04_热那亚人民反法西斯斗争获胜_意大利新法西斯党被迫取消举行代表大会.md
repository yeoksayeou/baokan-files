    Xinhua News Agency, Genoa, 2nd dispatch: Under the resolute opposition and heroic struggle of the Italian people, the Italian Neo-Fascist Party was forced to announce the cancellation of its Neo-Fascist Party Congress, originally scheduled to be held in Genoa today. The large-scale anti-fascist rallies and demonstrations held by the people of Genoa in recent days, despite the brutal suppression by the police, have been supported by the people of all of Italy. Cities such as Turin, Florence, Bologna, and Naples held anti-fascist demonstrations and marches yesterday and today to support the struggle of the people of Genoa. Workers in four cities, Genoa, Milan, Ferrara, and others, also decided to hold a general strike today to oppose the Neo-Fascist Party Congress. Faced with the angry tide of the Italian people's anti-fascist struggle, the Genoa local authorities had no choice but to inform the Neo-Fascist Party on the evening of the 1st that they could not "maintain order."
    After receiving the notification, the head of the Italian Neo-Fascist Party was forced to announce the cancellation of the congress.
    Following the announcement of the cancellation of the Neo-Fascist Party's meeting, the scheduled general strike has also been cancelled.

    据新华社2日讯　热那亚消息：在意大利人民的坚决反对和英勇斗争下，意大利新法西斯党被迫宣布取消原定今天在热那亚举行的新法西斯党代表大会。热那亚人民连日来不顾警察残暴的镇压举行的大规模反法西斯集会与游行示威受到全意大利人民的支持。都灵、佛罗伦萨、波沦亚、那不勒斯等城市在昨天和今天纷纷举行反法西斯示威游行，支持热那亚人民的斗争。热那亚、米兰、斐拉拉等四个城市的工人也曾决定在今天举行总罢工反对新法西斯党代表大会。面对意大利人民反法西斯斗争的怒潮，热那亚地方当局1日晚不得不向新法西斯党表示无法“维持秩序”。
    意大利新法西斯党头子接到通知后被迫宣布取消这次代表大会。
    在新法西斯党的会议宣布取消后，预定举行的总罢工也已取消。
