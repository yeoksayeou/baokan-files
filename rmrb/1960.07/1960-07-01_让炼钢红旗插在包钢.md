    Let the Steelmaking Red Flag Be Planted in Baotou Steel
    Alatan Bagen, Steelmaking Worker, Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, Baotou Steel

    Since the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace of Baotou Steel produced its first batch of molten steel on this year's "May Day," our steelmaking workers have been determined to extract more high-quality steel from this large open hearth furnace to support the faster leap forward in our country's socialist construction.

    The No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace of Baotou Steel encountered many difficulties when it was first put into production. For example, the molten iron had a high phosphorus content, making it difficult to produce high-quality steel. To solve this problem, we had to find a way to dissolve the phosphorus in the slag and remove it. However, because the furnace was newly put into production, the equipment was incomplete, and the furnace was not fully loaded at the beginning of production, making it difficult to discharge the slag. However, no difficulty could deter us steelmaking workers. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, we held a "three-way combination" production meeting before each heat of steel to study and improve the operating plan, and boldly adopted many new batching ratios, creating conditions for more and better slag discharge. By the time we were refining the fourth heat of steel, we had successfully overcome the high phosphorus barrier. Then, we took many other measures to force the steel production to rise in a straight line. Recently, we have basically achieved three shifts a day, with steel produced in every shift.

    Anyone who has made steel knows that making steel is about training people. When dealing with the tenacious steelmaking furnace, you cannot be complacent. We deeply feel that every bit of achievement we have made in production is due to the wise leadership of the Party. After the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace of Baotou Steel was put into production, the Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, the Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the leaders of the Baotou Steel Party Committee often came to our open hearth furnace to inspect the work, work with us, and solve many key production issues. Since the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace was put into production, the leading cadres of the steelmaking plant Party committee have been staying by the furnace day and night, just like our workers; some leading comrades have red eyes from staying up, but in order to seize high yields together with the workers, they insist on staying on the front line. The leadership and care of the Party have made the hearts of us steelmaking workers as boiling as molten steel. When we work, we feel full of energy. Wherever the Party points, we go. Recently, in order to seize even higher yields in the third quarter, the factory Party committee decided to carry out a maintenance of the open hearth furnace. All of us steelmaking workers have decided to combine this maintenance with the new technologies we have created in the technical revolution movement and apply them to the furnace. At the beginning of the third quarter, let our furnace participate in the national steelmaking workers' steel seizure battle with a new look, and let the national steelmaking red flag be planted in Baotou Steel.

    让炼钢红旗插在包钢
    包钢炼钢厂平炉车间炼钢工　阿拉坦巴根
    包钢一号大平炉自从今年“五一”流出第一炉钢水起，我们炼钢工人就下了决心：一定要从这座大平炉里夺取更多的优质钢，支援我国社会主义建设更快的跃进。
    包钢一号平炉一投入生产，就遇到许多困难。比如，铁水含磷较高，不容易炼出优质钢。为了解决这个问题，必须想办法使磷熔解在渣子里排走，而由于炉子刚投入生产，设备不全，一开始生产炉子又装不满，放渣很困难。但是，千难万难，难不住我们炼钢工人。我们在厂党委的领导下，每炼一炉钢，就在炉前召开一次“三结合”的生产会议，研究改进操作方案，大胆地采用了许多新的配料比，为多放渣、放好渣创造了条件，到炼第四炉钢的时候，就顺利地攻下了高磷关。接着，我们又采取了许多办法，迫使钢产量直线上升。最近，已基本上做到一天三班，班班出钢。
    炼过钢的人都知道，炼钢就是炼人。和顽强的炼钢炉打交道，一点也不能自满。我们深深感到，我们在生产上取得的一点一滴成就，都是由于党的英明领导。包钢一号平炉投入生产以后，内蒙古党委书记、中共包头市委书记和包钢党委的领导同志，经常到我们平炉上检查工作，和我们一块劳动，解决了许多生产关键。炼钢厂党委的领导干部，自从一号平炉投入生产以来，更是和我们工人一样，日夜守在炉旁；有的领导同志把眼都熬红了，但为了和工人一道夺高产，坚持不下火线。党的领导和关怀，使我们炼钢工人的心就像沸腾的钢水一样，工作起来，觉得浑身是劲。只要党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里。最近，厂党委为了在第三季度夺取更高的高产，决定对平炉进行一次检修。我们全体炼钢工人决定结合这次检修，把我们在技术革命运动中创造的新技术，都用到炉子上去。在第三季度开始的时候，让我们的炉子以崭新的面貌，参加全国炼钢工人的夺钢大会战，让全国炼钢红旗插在包钢。
