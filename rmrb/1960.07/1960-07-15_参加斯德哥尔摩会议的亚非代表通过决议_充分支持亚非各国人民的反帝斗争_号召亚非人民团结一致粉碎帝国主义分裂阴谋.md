Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 12th: Asian and African representatives attending the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm from July 9th to 11th, 1960, held a meeting and unanimously declared and resolved as follows:

For hundreds of years, many Asian and African countries and their vast populations have suffered greatly at the hands of Western imperialism and colonialism. All their human and material resources have been ruthlessly exploited by foreign imperialist interest groups, resulting in the impoverishment, regression, and misery of the people in this region.

The meeting most warmly congratulates the peoples and governments of those Asian and African countries who have freed themselves from imperialist rule and won independence in recent years.

The meeting also expresses its full and warm support for all struggles currently underway to win national independence and eliminate colonialism and imperialism in Asia and Africa.

At the same time, the meeting condemns the imperialist policies of division and diversion, and urgently calls upon the peoples of Asian and African countries to be vigilant and shatter these insidious conspiracies.

The meeting extends its warmest greetings to the heroic sons and daughters of Algeria, who are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against French imperialism to defend the honor, integrity, and independence of their motherland, and pays tribute to the heroic spirits of the brave warriors who sacrificed themselves in the struggle. The meeting condemns the relentless suppression of the patriotic struggle of Algeria by French imperialism, which is supported by US imperialism and other NATO countries. The meeting is convinced that the French government's treatment of representatives of the Free Algerian Government is unequal and therefore does not help to reach an honorable agreement, and condemns it. A ceasefire agreement can only be reached after an agreement on the issue of self-determination, and not before.

The meeting calls on all Asian and African governments and governments of other freedom-loving countries in the world that have not yet recognized the Provisional Government of Algeria to immediately recognize this government. The meeting also calls on all governments and patriotic organizations in African countries within the so-called French "Community" to oppose any assistance given by these countries to French imperialism in the unjust war waged by French imperialism against the Algerian people.

The meeting extends its warmest greetings and full support to the heroic Japanese people who are fighting against US imperialist control of their country, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and against the newly revised Japan-US military alliance treaty. The Japan-US military alliance treaty allows the United States to maintain military bases and armed forces on Japanese territory, and therefore this treaty aims to make Japan the hub of the aggressive nuclear strategy of the United States in the Far East against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries.

The meeting also sincerely supports the struggles of the people of Turkey, South Korea, South Vietnam, Tunisia, Morocco, Kenya, Zanzibar, and other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against foreign imperialist control and conspiracies.

The meeting condemns Belgium's continued dispatch of troops to the Congo Republic under the false pretext of protecting the lives of white men and women in the Congo Republic, the real purpose of which is to maintain imperialist rule.

The meeting unanimously and unequivocally condemns the actions of the Belgian imperialists, supported by other imperialist countries, to invade and undermine the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo. The meeting fully supports the heroic struggle of the Congolese people and calls on the people of Asia and Africa and peace-loving people all over the world to unite to defeat this aggression and this threat to world peace.

The meeting strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination directly caused by colonial rule or imperialist rule in Asian and African countries, and fully supports the noble struggle now being waged in South Africa to abolish this inhumane and immoral racial discrimination. In this regard, the meeting fully sympathizes with the various movements in various countries to implement economic and diplomatic boycotts against the current government of South Africa, and hopes that these movements will be completely successful, as long as that government remains irrational on this issue, which is of great importance to human unity and the maintenance of world peace.

The meeting condemns the existence of all foreign armed forces, military missions, and foreign military bases in Asian and African territories, as well as all aggressive military treaties such as NATO, CENTO, SEATO, and the proposed Northeast Asia Treaty Organization. These are an increasing threat to world peace. Therefore, the meeting fully supports all movements and struggles to abolish such bases, withdraw such armed forces and military missions, and abolish these treaties.

The meeting strongly condemns the political, economic, and military aggression of US imperialism against Cuba and other Latin American countries, and fully supports the struggle of the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries against US imperialism.

The meeting strongly protests against the persecution of fighters for peace and independence in many Asian and African countries. The meeting demands the immediate release of all these fighters who are still imprisoned and the cessation of all persecution against these patriots.

The meeting fully supports all sincere attempts to achieve comprehensive and complete disarmament for world peace. The meeting especially appreciates the continuous efforts made by the Soviet Union and Premier N. Khrushchev to reach an agreement among the major world powers on this extremely important issue. The meeting condemns the US imperialists for undermining the planned Paris summit and the ten-nation disarmament talks in Geneva. The meeting calls on all Asian and African people to support the disarmament movement launched by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

The meeting congratulates the All-Africa People's Conference and declares its support for all decisions made at this year's important African conferences—the All-Africa People's Conference in Tunis, the Conference of Independent African States in Addis Ababa, and the African Positive Action Conference in Accra.

The meeting declares its full support for the resolutions and decisions made at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April this year, and guarantees to implement these resolutions and to uphold and strengthen the great Conakry spirit—the spirit of unity and mutual support among the Asian and African people in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

For the independence, progress, and prosperity of all Asian and African countries and other parts of the world, the meeting further emphasizes the necessity and importance of unity and mutual support among all Asian and African peoples, and believes that such unity and mutual support are extremely important and indispensable for the abolition of colonialism and imperialism and the achievement of world peace.

　　参加斯德哥尔摩会议的亚非代表通过决议
　　充分支持亚非各国人民的反帝斗争
　　号召亚非人民团结一致粉碎帝国主义分裂阴谋
    新华社斯德哥尔摩12日电　参加1960年7月9日—11日在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平理事会常委会会议的亚洲和非洲代表们举行了一次会议，一致宣告并决议如下：
    亚洲和非洲许多国家和广大的人民几百年来一直在西方帝国主义和殖民主义的手中遭受巨大的苦难，他们的一切人力和物力遭到外国帝国主义利益集团的无情剥削，结果使这个地区的人民沦于贫穷、退步和悲惨的境地。
    会议最热烈地祝贺在最近几年内摆脱帝国主义的统治而赢得独立的那些亚洲和非洲国家的人民和政府。
    会议还对现在正在为争取民族独立和在亚洲和非洲消灭殖民主义和帝国主义而进行的一切斗争表示充分的和热烈的支持。
    同时会议谴责帝国主义的分裂和转移视线的政策，并且迫切地要求亚洲和非洲的各国人民警惕起来，粉碎这些阴险的阴谋。
    会议对为了保卫祖国的荣誉、完整和独立正在同法国帝国主义进行生死斗争的阿尔及利亚的英雄儿女们致以最热烈的敬礼并向在斗争中牺牲的英勇战士的英灵致敬。会议谴责得到美帝国主义和其他北大西洋公约组织国家支持的法国帝国主义对阿尔及利亚的爱国斗争的无情镇压。会议深信，法国政府对自由阿尔及利亚政府代表的待遇是不平等的，因此无助于达成一项光荣的协议，并且对此加以谴责。只能在就自决问题达成协议以后，而不是在这之前达成停火的协议。
    会议要求还未承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的一切亚洲和非洲国家政府和世界上其他爱好自由的国家的政府立即承认这个政府。会议还要求所谓法兰西“共同体”内的非洲国家的所有政府和爱国组织反对这些国家在法帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民进行的非正义战争中给予法国帝国主义任何帮助。
    会议向正在为反对美帝国主义控制他们的国家，反对日本军国主义的复活和反对新修改的日美军事同盟条约而进行斗争的英勇的日本人民致以最热烈的敬礼并全力支持它们。日美军事同盟条约使美国能够在日本领土上保持军事基地和武装部队，因此这项条约的目的是使日本成为美国在远东针对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家的侵略性核战略的枢纽。
    会议还真诚地支持土耳其、南朝鲜、南越、突尼斯、摩洛哥、怯尼亚、桑给巴尔以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲其他国家的人民反对外国帝国主义的控制和阴谋的斗争。
    会议谴责比利时在保护刚果共和国境内的白人男女的生命的虚伪借口下继续派遣军队前往刚果，这种行动的真正目的是维持帝国主义的统治。
    会议一致地、明确地谴责比利时帝国主义者在其他帝国主义国家支持下侵略和破坏刚果共和国的独立和主权的行动。会议全力支持进行英勇斗争的刚果人民，并号召亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来击败这种侵略和这种对世界和平的威胁。
    会议强烈谴责在亚非各国由于殖民统治或帝国主义统治而直接造成的各种形式的种族歧视，并全力支持现在在南非进行的争取取消这种不人道的和不道德的种族歧视的崇高斗争。在这方面，会议完全同情各国对南非现政府实行经济和外交抵制的各种运动，并希望这些运动完全成功，只要那个政府在这个对于人类团结和维护世界和平具有极大重要性的问题上仍然丧失理性的话。
    会议谴责在亚非领土上存在的所有外国武装部队、军事使团和外国军事基地以及像北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织、东南亚条约组织和拟议中的东北亚条约组织等一切侵略性的军事条约。这些都是对世界和平的日益增加的威胁。因此会议全力支持争取取消这种基地、撤退这种武装部队和军事使团以及取消这些条约的一切运动和斗争。
    会议强烈谴责美帝国主义对古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的政治、经济和军事的侵略，并全力支持古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    会议强烈抗议对许多亚非国家争取和平和独立的战士的迫害。会议要求立即释放所有现在仍被监禁的这些战士和停止对这些爱国者的一切迫害行动。
    会议全力支持为了世界和平在全面和彻底裁军方面作出的一切真诚的尝试。会议特别赞赏苏联和尼·赫鲁晓夫总理为了使世界大国在这个极其重要的问题上达成协议所进行的不断的努力。会议谴责美帝国主义者破坏计划中的巴黎首脑会议和在日内瓦举行的十国裁军谈判。会议呼吁所有亚非国家人民支持世界和平理事会常务委员会所发起的裁军运动。
    会议祝贺全非人民大会，并宣布它支持今年所有重要的非洲会议——在突尼斯举行的全非人民大会、在亚的斯亚贝巴举行的非洲独立国家会议和在阿克拉举行的非洲积极行动大会——所作出的一切决定。
    会议宣布全力支持今年4月在科纳克里举行的亚非人民团结大会所作出的决议和决定，并保证履行这些决议和维护和加强伟大的科纳克里精神——亚非人民在反对殖民主义和帝国主义斗争中团结和互相支持的精神。
    为了所有亚非国家和世界其他部分的独立、进步和繁荣，会议进一步强调所有亚非国家人民之间团结和互相支持的必要性和重要性，并认为这种团结和互相支持对废除殖民主义和帝国主义及取得世界和平是极其重要和不可缺少的。
                              1960年7月11日于斯德哥尔摩
