Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 6th. The Japanese literary delegation led by head Noma Hiroshi visited Guangzhou for sightseeing on the 3rd and left Guangzhou via Shenzhen on the 5th to return home.

The Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFC) and the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Writers Association held a banquet on the evening of the 4th to bid farewell to the delegation. At the banquet, Du Guoxiang, President of the Guangzhou branch of the CPAFC, on behalf of the Guangzhou branch of the CPAFC, the Guangzhou branch of the Writers Association, and cultural circles throughout the city, expressed high respect and heartfelt thanks to the delegation for their contributions during their visit to China in opposing the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people—U.S. imperialism—and strengthening the friendship between the two peoples in this struggle. Du Guoxiang said that due to the heroic Japanese people's persistent struggle, wave after wave, the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle has achieved significant victories. The power of the people is the decisive factor in the anti-imperialist struggle, and final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people. The Chinese people have consistently and unswervingly supported the Japanese people's struggle until the final victory.

Head of the delegation Noma Hiroshi spoke amidst warm applause. He said that during our visit to China for over a month, the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents has achieved new and brilliant victories. He said that we found in China what we needed most in our struggle. We deeply feel that we are closely united with the Chinese people. Now, the Japanese people's struggle is entering a new stage. We must overthrow the Kishi government, oppose the creation of a second Kishi government, and we want to establish a democratic, independent, and peaceful new government. In a few days, we will return to the front lines of the struggle, and we will do our utmost to guide this struggle towards a new victory.

Ouyang Shan, Chairman of the Guangzhou branch of the Writers Association, and Feng Naichao, Vice President of the Guangzhou branch of the CPAFC, both expressed in their speeches their wishes for the continuous strengthening of cultural exchanges between China and Japan and the friendly unity between the cultural circles of the two countries, and wished the Japanese people greater victories in the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle.

Other members of the delegation also emotionally expressed their impressions of their visit to China at the banquet. They unanimously believed that they had gained a lot and felt deeply during their month-long visit to China. Kamei Katsuichiro said that what moved me most was seeing Chairman Mao on June 21st, which is the golden age of my life. I must tell the Japanese people in detail about Chairman Mao's warm care and resolute support for the Japanese people. Takeuchi Minoru said that hearing the words "Because of the Japanese people's struggle, the Chinese people have re-evaluated the Japanese people" and "The Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the Japanese people" in China is unforgettable for me for life. All members of the delegation firmly stated that after returning to their country, they will definitely use their greatest strength to continue to wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests talked freely and frequently toasted for greater victories for the Japanese people in the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle, and for strengthening the friendship and unity between the writers and peoples of China and Japan.

During their stay in Guangzhou, the delegation also visited revolutionary historical sites in Guangzhou and visited people's communes.

On the 5th, when the Japanese literary delegation left Guangzhou, more than a hundred people from cultural circles went to the station to see them off, including Ouyang Shan, Vice President of the Guangzhou branch of the CPAFC and Chairman of the Guangzhou branch of the Writers Association, Du Ai, Vice President of the Guangzhou branch of the CPAFC, and Zhou Gangming, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou branch of the Writers Association.

Sun Pinghua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and writer Li Yingru accompanied the delegation to Shenzhen.
