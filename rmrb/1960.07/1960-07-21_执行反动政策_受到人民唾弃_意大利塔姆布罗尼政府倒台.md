Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th Dispatch: The Catholic Democratic Party's Tambroni government, despised by the Italian people, has finally fallen. On the 19th, this government submitted its resignation to the Italian President Gronchi.

The Tambroni government was formed in March after a government crisis lasting more than a month in Italy. At that time, due to significant differences of opinion within the Italian ruling bloc on how to continue implementing reactionary policies under the pressure of the Italian people's demand for changing reactionary policies, no bourgeois party from the "left" to the right supported this government except for Tambroni's own Catholic Democratic Party. This government was only barely able to come to power with the support of the far-right neo-fascist party.

The Catholic Democratic Party's open collusion with fascists and the subsequent rise of fascist forces aroused great anger among the Italian people who had suffered from fascist disasters. From the beginning of July, a massive anti-fascist demonstration movement broke out across Italy, demanding that the neo-fascist party be banned in accordance with the Italian constitution, and demanding the resignation of the Tambroni government. The Tambroni government brazenly carried out bloody suppression of the demonstrators, resulting in eleven people being killed and nearly a thousand injured.

The government's violent suppression aroused even greater upsurges in the people's movement. The people not only demanded the overthrow of the Tambroni government, but also urgently demanded the abandonment of the policies of this government that served the large monopoly groups. Under these circumstances, the Italian ruling group was forced to abandon the Tambroni government, attempting to ease the people's opposition. Under the arrangement of the Italian ruling group, the four bourgeois parties, the Catholic Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Republican Party, finally announced on the 16th that they had reached an agreement on the formation of a new government. This agreement stipulates that the new government will be composed of the Catholic Democratic Party alone and will implement the party's program, while the other three parties will support the government. According to Italian political figures, President Gronchi may begin consultations with all parties on the selection of a new prime minister today.

    执行反动政策  受到人民唾弃
    意大利塔姆布罗尼政府倒台
    新华社20日讯　罗马消息：受到意大利全国人民唾弃的天主教民主党塔姆布罗尼政府终于倒台。19日，这个政府已经向意大利总统格隆基提出辞职。
    塔姆布罗尼政府是在意大利发生了一次历时一个多月的政府危机后在3月间成立的。当时，由于意大利统治集团内部对于在意大利人民要求改变反动政策的压力下怎样继续推行反动政策意见十分分歧，除塔姆布罗尼自己的天主教民主党外，从“左”到右的资产阶级政党都不支持这个政府。这个政府最后靠极右翼的新法西斯党支持，才勉强上台。
    天主教民主党同法西斯分子的公开勾结以及随之而来的法西斯势力的抬头，引起了饱受法西斯祸害的意大利人民的巨大愤怒。从7月初起，意大利全国爆发了声势浩大的反法西斯示威运动，要求按照意大利宪法禁止新法西斯党，并且要求塔姆布罗尼政府辞职。塔姆布罗尼政府悍然对示威群众进行血腥镇压，结果有十一人被杀，还有将近一千人受伤。
    政府的暴力镇压激起了人民运动的更加高涨。人民不仅要求推翻塔姆布罗尼政府，而且迫切要求摒弃为大垄断集团服务的这个政府的政策。在这种情况下，意大利统治集团被迫抛弃塔姆布罗尼政府。企图借此缓和人民的反对。在意大利统治集团的安排下，天主教民主党、社会民主党、自由党和共和党这四个资产阶级政党终于在16日宣布达成关于成立新政府的协议。这个协议规定，新政府由天主教民主党一党组成，并且执行这个党的纲领，而其他三党则支持这个政府。据意大利政界人士说，总统格隆基可能在今天就新总理人选问题同各方面开始磋商。
