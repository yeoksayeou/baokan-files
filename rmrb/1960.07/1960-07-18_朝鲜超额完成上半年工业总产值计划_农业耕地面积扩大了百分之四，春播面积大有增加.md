Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: The public communique on the execution results of the 1960 first half-year people's economic development plan, published today by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, shows that North Korea exceeded its first half-year industrial gross output value plan by 7%. The agricultural cultivated land area expanded by 4%, and the spring planting area greatly increased compared to the same period last year.

According to the communique issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of Korea, the working people of the northern part of the republic, in order to actively support and aid the South Korean people's struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs, and to greet the 15th anniversary of Korea's liberation on "August 15" with greater labor achievements, continued to set off a high tide of socialist construction, and effectively executed the tasks of the first half of 1960.

The communique stated that the industrial gross output value plan for the first half of 1960 was exceeded by 7%, and the industrial gross output value increased by 12% compared with the first half of 1959.

The communique pointed out that in the first half of 1960, workers extensively launched the highest form of the Korean socialist competition—the action to strive for the title of "Chollima Work Team," gloriously over fulfilling the planned tasks they undertook. The production of major industrial products such as coal, pig iron, steel, steel products, chemical fertilizers, cement, metal cutting machine tools, agricultural machinery, textiles, shoes, processed aquatic products, and cigarettes exceeded the planned targets.

The communique stated that compared with the first half of 1959, the growth rates of various major industrial products produced in the first half of 1960 are as follows: electricity 12%, coal 21%, iron ore 32%, pig iron 32%, steel 36%, steel products 46%, metal cutting machine tools 44%, agricultural machinery 2.5 times, chemical fertilizer 27%, cement 22%, paper 5%, textiles 38%, shoes 22%.

The communique mentioned that in the first half of 1960, labor productivity exceeded the plan by 6%. Various industrial departments put forward 22,000 inventions and rationalization proposals. The level of mechanization of many heavy physical labor operations has been improved.

The communique stated that in order to promote agricultural mechanization, in the first half of 1960, more than 1,600 tractors and trucks, more than 5,000 trailers, more than 23,000 ox carts and horse carts, more than 77,000 seeders and weeders, and more than 4,000 electric motors and transformers were supplied to the agricultural sector.

The communique stated that in the first half of this year, agricultural cooperative members carried out agricultural production at an unprecedented speed, setting off a high tide of production in the agricultural sector. During this period, the cultivated area was newly expanded by 4% in various regions. By the end of June this year, the spring sowing area reached 2.53 million chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo), an increase of 340,000 chongbo compared to the same period last year. The grain sowing area increased by 566,000 chongbo compared to the same period last year. The vegetable cultivation area also increased by 39% compared to the same period last year.

The communique stated that the railway freight volume in the first half of this year exceeded the plan by 3%, an increase of 11% compared with the same period last year.

The communique stated that the investment focus of capital construction in the first half of this year was on agricultural mechanization, chemical fiber industry, mining, and housing construction. Compared with the same period last year, the investment in capital construction in these departments increased by 1.5 times, 47%, 36%, and 72% respectively. In the first half of this year, a new capacity of 20,000 kVA of electricity, 140,000 tons of non-ferrous metal ore dressing, 350,000 tons of coke, 6,600 tons of cotton yarn, and 3.04 million meters of cloth were built. In addition, key construction projects such as the Pyongyang Grand Theatre, the National Central Liberation Struggle Museum, and the Okryu Restaurant, which were newly built in Pyongyang, are proceeding victoriously. The communique stated that with the growth of production, the people's living standards are also constantly improving. In the first half of this year, 613,000 square meters of housing were built in urban and rural areas. More than 480 new health institutions have been added.
