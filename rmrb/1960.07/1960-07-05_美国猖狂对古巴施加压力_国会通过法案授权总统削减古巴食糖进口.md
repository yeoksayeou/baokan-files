Xinhua News Agency, July 4th, Washington Dispatch: The United States Senate, following the House of Representatives, outrageously passed a bill on the morning of July 3rd authorizing the President to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota. Thus, this long-planned measure by the US authorities to interfere in Cuba and further ramp up economic pressure has finally completed the legislative process.

According to this bill, Congress has "authorized" the US President to reduce the sugar quota imported from Cuba at any time before the US Congress conducts a so-called comprehensive discussion on revising the sugar law at the end of March 1961.

During an all-night session of the US Senate on July 2nd, Senator Dirksen, under instructions from the White House, told senators that Eisenhower "strongly insisted" that Congress must quickly pass this bill "so that we (the United States) can have a weapon to deal with the (Cuban) situation."

Dirksen said that Eisenhower also stated that, given the "urgency" of Congress passing this interventionist bill, he would convene a special session of Congress on the 5th to specifically discuss the issue if the bill could not be passed before Congress's summer recess.

    美国猖狂对古巴施加压力
    国会通过法案授权总统削减古巴食糖进口
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院3日晨继众议院之后悍然通过了授权总统削减古巴食糖进口份额的法案。至此，美国当局这项策划已久的对古巴进行干涉和进一步猖狂地施加经济压力的措施，最后完成了立法手续。
    根据这项法案，国会已“授权”美国总统在1961年3月底美国国会进行所谓全面讨论修改食糖法问题之前，可以随时削减从古巴进口的食糖份额。
    在美国参议院2日举行的通宵会议上，参议员德克森在白宫授意下对参议员们说，艾森豪威尔“十分坚持”国会必须迅速通过这项法案，“以便我们（美国）能掌握一种对付（古巴）局势的武器”。
    德克森说，艾森豪威尔还表示，鉴于国会通过这项干涉性法案所“具有的急迫性”，如果在国会夏季休会前不能通过这项法案的话，他将在5日召集国会特别会议来专门讨论这个问题。
