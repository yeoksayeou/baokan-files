Xinhua News Agency, London, July 28th: British Prime Minister Macmillan announced a government reshuffle last night. The reshuffle was announced after Heathcoat-Amory resigned from his post as Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday. To fill his vacancy, Lloyd, the former Foreign Secretary, was transferred to the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer; Home, a member of the House of Lords and former Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, was transferred to the post of Foreign Secretary; and Sandys, the former Minister of Aviation, was transferred to the post of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thorneycroft, who resigned in 1958 due to disagreements with the government, rejoined the cabinet as Minister of Aviation. The appointment of Lord Home, a member of the House of Lords, as Foreign Secretary has been widely opposed by the British public. This Earl is a so-called "Munich figure" who faithfully served under Chamberlain.

British newspapers admit that the appointment of Sandys, "known for his toughness," as the new Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is to strengthen the suppression of colonial national independence movements.

    英国政府改组
    据新华社伦敦28日电  英国首相麦克米伦昨天晚上宣布改组政府。这次改组是在希思寇特—埃默里昨天辞去了财政大臣的职务以后宣布的。为了填补他的空缺，原任外交大臣的劳埃德调任财政大臣，上院议员、原任联邦关系大臣的霍姆调任外交大臣，而原任航空大臣的桑迪斯则调任联邦关系大臣。在1958年因为同政府政见不合而辞职的前财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特重新参加了内阁，任航空大臣。任命上院议员霍姆为外交大臣的做法遭到了英国公众的广泛反对。这位伯爵是一位所谓“慕尼黑人物”，他曾在张伯伦手下忠实地服务过。
    英国报刊承认，任命“以强硬闻名”的桑迪斯为新的联邦关系大臣，是为了加强对殖民地民族独立运动的镇压。
