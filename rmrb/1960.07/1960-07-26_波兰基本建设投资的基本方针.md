Basic Guidelines for Capital Construction Investment in Poland
Poland, W. Dudziński

People's Poland began to restore and develop its economy in 1945 under the dual heavy burdens of capitalist legacy of imbalance and comprehensive backwardness and the enormous war damage (38% of the national wealth was destroyed by the war). The Party, which has led our people in the struggle for economic and cultural prosperity for fifteen years, decided at that time to concentrate all social and economic forces to fully restore and comprehensively develop the country's economy. Poland was once an agricultural country with a low level of productivity, lacking many production sectors necessary for national industrialization, and therefore had a large reserve of manpower in urban and rural areas.

These conditions determined the scale, direction, and speed of our capital construction. After the period of mainly recovery from 1945 to 1949, we first focused on developing heavy industry and the construction industry, which determined the overall development speed of the national economy. The implementation of the Six-Year Plan (1950 to 1955) greatly transformed our entire economic structure, and this transformation process has been continuing to deepen ever since. The starting point of our plan is to maximize the use of labor resources and attract millions of farmers from overpopulated rural areas to participate in industrial production. During the Six-Year Plan, the average number of employees outside agriculture increased by 400,000 to 500,000 people per year from 1949. The accelerated industrialization policy consistently pursued by the Party eliminated unemployment in cities within a few years and greatly reduced the surplus labor force in rural areas. The period from 1945 to recent years can be called the stage of extensive development of our economy.

While utilizing labor resources to ensure the implementation of the policy of rapid capital construction, the Party also steadily improved the living standards of the people. There was a particularly sharp leap forward between 1949 and 1950. The accumulation portion grew from 15% of the national income in 1949 to 20% in 1950. And it was 19.6% in 1951, 22% in 1952, and 27.1% in 1953. The last year was the year with the highest investment amount, more than doubled the 1949 level, accounting for 16% of the national income (net growth rate of fixed funds).

The investment after 1950 increased almost five times more than in capitalist Poland, calculated at an annual average rate. The industrial sectors that produce means of production (metallurgical industry, machine manufacturing industry, building materials industry, chemical industry) have become a huge force.

Poland's development of heavy industry, chemical industry, and construction industry was faster than other national economic sectors, thus laying the foundation for transforming and further developing the entire industry and agriculture, for ensuring the rapid improvement of the entire national economy and the growth of people's welfare. Poland's capital construction plan was realized with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union supplied us with major industrial raw materials (iron sand, cotton, etc.) and a large amount of machinery and equipment, greatly easing and accelerating our country's industrialization process. This assistance and our country's constantly expanding trade with the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries are important factors in Poland's economic development.

Comrade Gomulka said at the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party: "Thanks to cooperation with socialist countries, first of all the Soviet Union, relying on fraternal assistance, and thanks to the selfless labor of the entire people, we have been able to develop our country's productive forces and greatly develop the economy, culture, science and education. We have changed the face of our country. No capitalist country that was once so backward and suffered such serious war damage could have made such a leap." In 1959, steel production exceeded six million tons, which is three times more than in 1938 before the war, and electricity reached 25 billion kilowatt-hours, which is six times more than before the war. The fastest growing sector after the war is the machine manufacturing industry, which is a sector of major significance for the development of the entire national economy. Before the war, Poland's machine manufacturing industry was only in its infancy, and its share in the country's already weak industrial production was less than 7%. Now the production level of the machine manufacturing industry is twenty times that of before the war, and its proportion in the entire industrial production has increased to 20.6%.

The development of the machine manufacturing industry has enabled us to assemble hundreds of new factories, although initially smaller factories of light industry and food industry. At the same time, we have greatly renewed metal processing machine tools.

The development of the means of production industry has enabled us to widely carry out the construction of housing, schools, hospitals, kindergartens and many other social and cultural facilities.

Along with the remarkable development of heavy industry, light industry and food industry have also developed. Many new enterprises have been built, and existing enterprises have been expanded. Due to the increase in the quantity of machines, agricultural tools, fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the extensive soil improvement work, the labor productivity of agriculture has increased. For example, the agricultural production level in 1958 almost exceeded 19% before the war, and this was under the conditions of reduced cultivated land area and reduced population (both the total population and the rural population have decreased). If calculated per 100 hectares of cultivated land, the production increased by 50%, and if calculated per capita, it increased by 41%.

In short, the policy of our Party in determining the speed and structure of national economic development in capital construction has transformed Poland from an agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country. If two-thirds of the independently employed population in pre-war Poland were engaged in agriculture, and only one-third worked in industry and other sectors, then this proportional relationship has now undergone the opposite change. Industry (all large and medium-sized industries are socialist) is the main source of production and national income growth. Currently, the total industrial output exceeds five times that of pre-war, and the national income exceeds two times, and per capita, it exceeds two and a half times.

The characteristic of the past period was the rapid increase in investment, which drastically changed Poland's economic and social structure. This period proves how profound the contrast is between today's Poland and pre-war bourgeois Poland. The economy of pre-war Poland sometimes experienced extreme recession and sometimes abnormal development. In 1938, the output of many major products was lower than in 1913, that is, on the eve of the First World War.

Thanks to the Party's policy and the efforts of the entire people, fifteen years have laid the foundation for further increasing investment in our country's national economy and further dramatically improving our economy. Comrade Gomulka said at the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, "The growth of the production of means of production is particularly pleasing to us, because the expansion and modernization of long-term means of production provide the main conditions for the universal development of our country's economy, the improvement of social labor productivity, and the establishment of new labor sectors to ensure people's employment. At the same time, the growth of heavy industry potential is necessary for the faster development of the construction industry, the construction of housing, the expansion of public utilities networks, and so on."

The resolutions passed by the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party and the subsequent Central Plenary Session determined the direction and speed of further development of the People's Poland economy and the policy of capital construction in the recent period.

In the later period of the Six-Year Plan and the years of the 1956-1960 Five-Year Plan, the growth rate of investment decreased to some extent. After reaching a maximum in 1953, the indicators gradually declined in the following years. The net growth rate of fixed funds accounted for 16% of the national income in 1953 (accounting for 27.1% of accumulation), and dropped to 13.6% in 1957. This situation was necessary due to the imbalance in the development of the capital construction base. For example, if the total amount of construction and installation work increased by 124% in 1953 compared to 1950, then the products of the building materials industry only increased by 89% in the same period. It was not until 1957 that this imbalance was overcome. During this period, it was also necessary to adjust many other imbalances in order to rationally utilize production potential. These phenomena occurred in the process of rapid development in various industrial sectors, and even within individual industrial sectors, especially in the machine manufacturing sector.

However, from 1958, the net growth index of fixed funds increased again, reaching 18.3% in 1960. The development speed of heavy industry is again higher than other industrial sectors. This is necessary to ensure the further rapid upsurge of the entire national economy. In this way, a solid foundation has been established for the planned further dramatic improvement of the Polish economy in 1961-1965.

If the investment in the 1956-1960 first Five-Year Plan increased by 46% compared to the 1950-1955 Six-Year Plan, then the investment in the future Five-Year Plan years will increase by 50%-52% compared to the past Five-Year Plan. The net growth rate of fixed funds in the national income (according to preliminary estimates) will increase from 18.3% to about 20%. These figures illustrate the growth of investment in our country's economy. In 1965, industrial production will exceed 50% of 1960 (while national income will increase by almost 40%, and will be ten times that of 1938 before the war).

What are the main guidelines and nature of capital construction in the upcoming Five-Year Plan?

One of the basic guidelines is that the development of the domestic raw material base must be taken into account. Our rapidly developing industry requires increasingly more and modern raw materials. Therefore, along with the increase in coal mining, especially lignite mining, we will increase the production of sulfur and natural gas. Concentrate efforts on producing raw materials that are widely used in modern industry, such as aluminum, copper, man-made fibers, plastics, wood fiberboard, synthetic rubber, and so on.

In order to expand the source of raw material supply, the state will allocate a large amount of funds to develop the chemical industry. In the 1961-1965 Five-Year Plan, the investment in this sector will be equal to the sum of the investment in the chemical industry in the fifteen years since the founding of People's Poland. The production of this industrial sector will increase to 210%. The chemical industry will greatly increase the country's raw material supply and produce some substitute materials for lacking raw materials (wood, leather, non-ferrous metals, etc.). Doubling the output of nitrogen fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer will greatly increase agricultural yields. A huge oil refinery with an annual output of six million tons will be established near Płock. This factory will obtain the required crude oil from the Soviet Union through a 700-kilometer-long oil pipeline. In addition to the oil refinery, a huge petrochemical complex will also be established. Relying on this enterprise, our chemical industry will be greatly enriched by some particularly inexpensive products. The Płock refinery is the largest project in the 1961-1965 Five-Year Plan. The oil it refines will be seven and a half times the total refining capacity of all existing oil factories in Poland.

We will continue to develop the metallurgical industry. The current steel production is 6.3 million tons. It will almost increase by 3 million tons by the end of 1965. The largest metallurgical enterprise established since the founding of People's Poland is the Lenin Metallurgical Combine. After its expansion, its steel production capacity will increase from 1.5 million tons to 3.5 million tons.

The second basic guideline of the economic policy in the upcoming Five-Year Plan regarding investment is to vigorously strengthen production. In other words, when carrying out capital investment, attention should be paid to technological improvement in terms of production methods and product design as well as improving labor productivity. From 1961 to 1965, 80% of the increase in production will rely on the increase in labor productivity. This is a bold task, because in the past few Five-Year Plans, the corresponding production growth rate was only 52% to 64%. Therefore, in developing the economy, we will simultaneously carry out production modernization.

This will be particularly reflected in the allocation of capital investment in the machine manufacturing industry. In this regard, the precision manufacturing industry sector, such as electronic instruments and the electronics industry, will be developed first. Great attention will be paid to improving product quality and reducing the weight of machines per unit capacity.

In terms of transportation, great emphasis will be placed on increasing modern vehicles. For example, in railways, electric and diesel traction will be used on an increasingly large scale. A large amount of investment will increase locomotive power eleven times more than before the war.

The key issue in the textile industry is the modernization of equipment. The average productivity of machines in this sector will increase by 15%-35%. Nevertheless, new textile factories are also planned to be established and textile machines will be increased. The food industry and other consumer goods industries will also be modernized and production capacity will be expanded.

The third main task of investment that must be solved in the upcoming Five-Year Plan is to strengthen agricultural production. Needless to say, the Party and the government will mainly pay attention to the socialist components in agriculture - the modernization and intensification of production of state-owned farms. In agriculture, it is necessary to improve human labor productivity by expanding mechanization methods or to increase yields by increasing the supply of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. New agricultural and animal husbandry methods must be adopted and soil improvement work must be widely implemented. For this reason, it is necessary to expand the machine and chemical industries, especially to increase the output of agricultural machines and soil improvement machines, and to increase direct investment in agriculture.

The Second Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party held last year adopted a plan for agricultural mechanization. According to the resolution of the Central Plenary Session, a so-called agricultural development fund was established. This fund is established by the difference between the price at which farmers sell products to the state and the market price. These funds are set up in each village and are supplemented according to the amount sold to the state. These funds are sufficient to supply them with three-quarters of the cost of purchasing tractors and a full set of machines, which are used jointly by farmers. The agricultural development fund was established in 1959. The establishment of this fund will enable rural areas to have 9,000 tractors and a full set of machines by the end of 1960. By the end of 1965, the total amount of the fund will reach 25 billion zlotys (Polish currency), and Polish rural areas will receive more than 100,000 tractors. From the brief description of Poland's investment situation from 1945-1965, it can be seen that no capitalist country has such a high growth rate. We have built hundreds of new industrial enterprises and public works, and we will build hundreds and thousands of new industrial enterprises and public works. Due to the unprecedented growth of our country's heavy industry potential, the Polish economy will obtain a broad and reliable foundation for further rapid upsurge. This will benefit the cause of improving the living welfare of residents in all socialist countries. From 1961-1965, huge sums of money will be allocated to build housing, social and cultural facilities. It is planned to build about 2.75 million houses, 5,000 schools, and many hospitals, cultural palaces, kindergartens, sports fields, etc. in urban and rural areas.

The Polish people know that the results of the Polish people's efforts in capital construction for sixteen years have not only enabled Poland to move forward along the socialist road, but also promoted the rise of the economic strength of the peace and socialist camp with its own strength, and contributed its meager strength to the cause of the inevitable victory of socialism over capitalism in the world.

    波兰基本建设投资的基本方针
    波兰　维·杜德金斯基
    1945年人民波兰在双重的沉重负担下开始恢复和发展自己的经济。这种沉重的负担就是资本主义遗留下的不均衡和全面落后以及巨大的战争破坏（国民财富遭到战争破坏的有38％）。十五年来领导我国人民为经济和文化的繁荣而斗争的党，当时决定集中全部社会和经济力量充分恢复和全面发展国家的经济。波兰曾经是生产力水平低的农业国家，国家工业化所必需的许多生产部门都没有，因而城市和乡村有大量的人力后备。
    这些条件决定了我国基本建设的规模、方向和速度。经过1945到1949年主要是恢复的时期以后，我们首先着手发展决定国民经济整个发展速度的重工业和建筑业。六年计划（1950到1955年）执行的结果，大大改造了我国的整个经济结构，此后一直到现在，都在继续加深这一改造过程。我们的计划的出发点，首先是最大限度地利用劳动力资源，吸引人口过剩的农村的数百万农民参加工业生产。在六年计划期间，从1949年起，农业以外的平均就业人数每年增加四十万到五十万人。党一直坚持实行的加速工业化政策，在几年内就消灭了城市中的失业现象，并大大减少了农村的剩余劳动力。从1945年到最近几年的这段时期，可以称作是我国经济广泛发展的阶段。
    党利用劳动力资源，保证执行快速进行基本建设的政策，同时也有步骤地提高了人民的生活水平。特别是在1949到1950年间有了一个急剧的跃进。积累的部分从1949年占国民收入的15％，增长到1950年的20％。而1951年是19.6％，1952年是22％，1953年是27.1％。最后一年是投资额最高的一年，比1949年水平增加了一倍以上，占国民收入的16％（固定基金的纯增长率）。
    1950年以后的投资按年平均率计算比资本主义波兰几乎增加了五倍。生产生产资料的工业部门（冶金工业、机器制造工业、建筑材料工业、化学工业）变成了巨大的力量。
    波兰发展重工业、化学工业和建筑工业的速度比其它国民经济部门快，因而为改造和进一步发展整个工业和农业、为保证整个国民经济的急剧提高和人民福利的增长打下了基础。波兰的基本建设计划是在苏联大力帮助下实现的。苏联供给了我们主要工业原料（铁砂、棉花等等）和大量机器设备，大大减轻和加快了我国工业化的进程。这种援助和我国同中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家不断扩大的贸易，是波兰经济发展的重要因素。
    哥穆尔卡同志在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会上说过：“由于同社会主义国家、首先是苏联的合作，依靠兄弟般的帮助，由于全体人民忘我的劳动，我们能够发展了我国的生产力，使经济、文化、科学和教育能大大发展。我们改变了我们国家的面貌。没有任何一个曾是如此落后并遭受到战争严重破坏的资本主义国家，能够作出这样的飞跃。”1959年，钢产量超过了六百万吨，即比战前的1938年增加了三倍，电力达到二百五十亿度，较战前增加了六倍。战后发展最快的是机器制造业，这是对整个国民经济的发展具有主要意义的部门。战前，波兰的机器制造业只处在萌芽时期，它在全国本很薄弱的工业生产中所占的份额在7％以下。现在机器制造业的生产水平为战前的二十倍，它在整个工业生产中占的比重增长到20.6％。
    机器制造业的发展使我们能够装配几百个新工厂，虽然开始时是较小的和轻工业和食品工业工厂。同时我们大量更新了金属加工机床。
    生产资料工业的发展，使我们能广泛展开住宅、学校、医院、幼儿园及其它许多社会和文化设施的建设。
    随着重工业卓著成效的发展，轻工业和食品工业也有了发展。新建了许多企业，扩建了现有企业。由于机器、农具、化肥和农药供应数量的增加，以及广泛进行的土壤改良工作，农业的劳动生产率提高了。例如，1958年农业生产水平几乎超过战前19％，而且是在耕地面积缩小和居民减少了（总人口和农村人口都减少了）的情况下。如果按一百公顷耕地计算，则生产增加了50％，按人口平均计算则增加了41％。
    总之，我们党在决定国民经济发展速度和结构的基本建设方面的政策，使波兰由一个农业国变成了工业和农业国。如果说战前波兰占独立谋生人口三分之二的人从事农业，在工业及其它部门工作的只占三分之一，那末现在这种比例关系已经发生了相反的变化。工业（所有的大中工业都是社会主义的）是生产和国民收入增长的主要源泉。目前，工业总产量超过战前五倍，国民收入超过二倍，按人口平均计算，则超过二倍半。
    过去一段时期的特点是投资的迅速增加，这些投资急剧地改变着波兰的经济和社会结构。这段时期证明，今天的波兰同战前资产阶级波兰的对比多么深刻。战前波兰的经济有时极度衰退，有时畸形发展，1938年许多主要产品的产量低于1913年即第一次世界大战前夕。
    由于党的政策和全体人民的努力，十五年来已为进一步增加对我国国民经济的投资和进一步急剧地提高我国经济奠定了基础。哥穆尔卡同志在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会上说，“生产资料生产的增长特别使我们高兴，因为长期使用的生产资料的扩大和现代化，是我国经济普遍发展、社会劳动生产率的提高，以及为保证人们就业而建立新的劳动部门提供了主要的条件。同时，重工业潜力的增长对于更快地发展建筑工业、修建住宅、扩大公用事业网等等都是必要的。”
    波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会以及其后的中央全会上通过的决议，决定了进一步发展人民波兰经济的方向和速度以及最近时期内基本建设的政策。
    在六年计划的后期和1956—1960年五年计划的年代中，投资的增长速度有了某种程度的下降。在1953年达到最大限度后，其后的数年内指标逐渐下降，1953年固定基金的纯增长率占国民收入的16％（占积累的27.1％），到1957年则下降到13.6％。由于基本建设基地发展的不平衡，这种情况曾是必要的。例如，如果说建筑装配工作总量在1953年比1950年增加124％，那末建筑材料工业产品在同一期间内只增加89％。只是到了1957年才克服了这种不均衡现象。在这段时期内，为了合理地利用生产潜力，还必须调整好多其它的不均衡现象。这些现象是在急剧发展进程中在各个工业部门，甚至个别工业部门内部而首先是机器制造业部门里发生的。
    但是，从1958年起固定基金的纯增长指数再度增长，到1960年达到18.3％。重工业发展的速度又比其它工业部门高。这对于保证整个国民经济的进一步迅速高涨是必要的。就这样，为计划在1961—1965年进一步急剧提高波兰经济建立了巩固的基础。
    如果说在1956—1960年第一个五年计划内的投资比1950—1955年六年计划增加46％，那末在未来的五年计划年份内的投资将比过去的五年计划增加50％—52％。国民收入中的固定基金的纯增长率（按预先估计的材料）将从18.3％增加到20％左右。这些数字说明我国经济中投资的增长情况。1965年工业生产将超过1960年50％（而国民收入几乎增加40％，并为战前1938年的十倍）。
    在今后的五年计划内基本建设的主要方针和性质如何呢？
    基本方针之一，是必须考虑到发展本国原料基地问题。我们迅速发展的工业要求日益多的、而且是现代的原料。因此，随着煤炭，首先是褐煤开采量的增加，我们将增产硫黄、天然瓦斯。集中力量生产现代工业中被广泛利用的原料，如铝、铜、人造纤维、塑料、木质纤维板、综合橡胶等等。
    为了扩大原料供应来源，国家将拨出大量资金发展化学工业。在1961—1965年的五年计划中，对这个部门的投资将等于人民波兰建国以来十五年对化学工业投资的总和。这个工业部门的生产将增为210％，化学工业将大大增加国家的原料供应，并生产出一些缺少原料（木材、皮革、有色金属等）的代用物资。把氮肥和磷肥的产量增加一倍，将大大提高农业收获量。在普洛茨卡近郊，将建立年产六百万吨的巨大石油精炼厂。这个厂将通过一条七百公里长的油管从苏联取得所需原油。除了石油精炼厂以外，还要建立一个巨大的石油化学联合企业。依靠这个企业，我们的化学工业将因一些特别廉价的产品而内容大为丰富。普洛茨卡的炼油厂是1961—1965年五年计划中最大的工程。它所炼的石油，将为波兰现有一切石油厂炼油能力总和的七倍半。
    我们将继续发展冶金工业。目前钢产量是六百三十万吨。到1965年底几乎将增加三百万吨。在人民波兰开国以来建立的最大冶金企业是列宁冶金联合企业。它在扩建后，产钢能力将从一百五十万吨增加到三百五十万吨。
    未来五年计划中经济政策的决定投资方面的第二个基本方针是大力加强生产。换句话说就是，在进行资本投资时，无论在生产方法和产品设计以及提高劳动生产率上都注意技术改进。在1961年到1965年，80％的生产的增加将依靠劳动生产率的增加。这是一个大胆的任务，因为在过去几个五年计划中，相应的生产增长率只是52％到64％。因此，在发展经济中，我们将同时进行生产现代化。
    这点将特别表现在对机器制造业的资本投资的分配方面。在这方面，首先将发展精密制造工业部门，像电子仪器和电子工业。将大大注意改进产品质量并减少机器按单位能力计算的重量。
    在运输方面将大为重视增加现代化的车辆。例如在铁路方面将日益大规模地使用电气和柴油曳引。大量的投资将使机车动力比战前增加十一倍。
    纺织工业的关键问题是设备的现代化。这个部门的机器平均生产率将提高15％—35％。尽管如此，还准备建立新的纺织厂并增加纺织机。食品工业和其他一些消费品工业也将进行现代化并扩大生产能力。
    在未来的五年计划中必须解决的投资的第三个主要任务是加强农业生产。不用说，党和政府主要地将注意农业中社会主义成份——国营农场的现代化和生产的集约性。在农业中无论是用扩大机械化方法来提高人的劳动生产率或是增加矿化肥和农药供应来提高收获量，都是必要的。必须采用新的农业和畜牧业方法并广泛推行土壤改良工作。为此，必须扩大机器和化学工业，特别是增加农业机器和改良土壤机器的产量，并增加对农业的直接投资。
    去年召开的波兰统一工人党二中全会，通过了农业机械化的计划。根据中央全会的决议建立了所谓农业发展基金，这种基金是由农民向国家交售产品的价格和市场价格的差额建立起来的。在每个乡村都设有这种基金，并且按照向国家交售的数额予以补充。这些基金足够供应他们购买拖拉机和全套机器费用的四分之三，这些机器由农民共同使用。农业发展基金是1959年建立的。这种基金的建立将使农村到1960年底有可能拥有九千部拖拉机和全套机器。到1965年底，基金总额将达到二百五十亿兹罗提（波币），波兰农村将得到十万部以上的拖拉机。从1945—1965年波兰投资情况的简短叙述中看出任何一个资本主义国家都没有这样高的增长速度。我们已经建成了上百个新的工业企业和公共工程，还要建设几百几千个新的工业企业和公共工程。由于我国重工业潜力的空前增长，波兰经济将获得进一步迅速高涨的广泛和可靠的基础。这将有利于所有社会主义国家提高居民生活福利的事业。在1961—1965年，将拨巨款兴建住宅、社会和文化设施。计划在城乡兴建约二百七十五万间住房、五千所学校以及许多医院、文化宫、幼儿园、运动场等等。
    波兰人民知道，人民波兰十六年来在基本建设方面努力的结果，不仅使波兰沿着社会主义道路向前迈进，而且以自己的力量促进和平和社会主义阵营经济实力的高涨，并以自己的微薄力量贡献于社会主义在世界范围内必然战胜资本主义的事业。
