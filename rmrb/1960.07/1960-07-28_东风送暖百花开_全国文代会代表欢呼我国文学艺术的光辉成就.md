The East Wind Brings Warmth and a Hundred Flowers Bloom
-- Representatives to the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers Cheer the Brilliant Achievements of China's Literature and Art
By Our Correspondent

The representatives from all corners of the motherland and various literary and artistic work posts who came to participate in the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers have been completely immersed in an atmosphere of excitement, emotion, and happiness these days. In the solemn meetings, in the group discussions, and during breaks, everyone kept talking. What people felt first was how brilliant the achievements of China's literature and art have been in the past ten years, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward. They enthusiastically hailed the great victory of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and hailed the tremendous achievements of China's literature and art in letting a hundred flowers bloom in the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

After listening to Comrade Zhou Yang's report, the worker-writers Li Xue'ao and Zhang Fuzeng from the Beijing delegation excitedly went to Zhao Xueqin, a young worker-author from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory who was also a member of the delegation, to congratulate them on the success of their factory history, "Red Star of the North," and eagerly wanted to know the creative process of this excellent work. This was because Comrade Zhou Yang mentioned in his report that "Red Star of the North" was one of the valuable fruits of the workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres who took up their pens to write their own history. Zhao Xueqin, who participated in the writing of this factory history of 360,000 words, used vivid facts to illustrate that this work was the crystallization of collective wisdom, the result of a mass movement under the leadership of the factory Party committee and with the help of professional writers. The success of this work powerfully proved the correctness of "implementing the mass line in literary and artistic work and actively developing the amateur literary and artistic movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers." In the creative process of more than a year, nearly ten thousand workers in the factory participated in symposiums and recollections. After oral recordings, more than five thousand memoirs were written, and after meticulous investigation and visits, with the help of workers from other places, they finally completely and vividly recorded the history of the revolutionary struggle of this factory, one of the birthplaces of the "February 7th" strike, for nearly sixty years. The red line of the Party's leadership is the main trunk of this factory history, but at the beginning of the writing, there was a great lack of materials in this regard. How was the line connecting the Party and the workers initially connected? In the process of deeply mobilizing the masses to recall, Sun Maolin, an old worker in his sixties, provided valuable materials and wrote the first chapter of the full text, "The Person Who Buys Sesame Cakes and Fried Dough Sticks." Such examples are too numerous to mention. Many precious historical facts of revolutionary struggle preserved in the minds of the workers made this work vivid and fleshy, and became a textbook of revolutionary traditions.

At this National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the fragrance of blooming theatrical art flowers wafted. More than 500 representatives from the theatrical circles from all over the country were all beaming with joy. In their conversations, they all praised the tremendous achievements of the motherland's theatrical art in recent years.

Mei Lanfang has participated in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers for the third time. He happily said that the representatives of the theatrical circles attending this National Congress of Literary and Art Workers are several times more than those at the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, and the types of dramas represented are also much wider. Among them, there are many types of dramas that have been revitalized from the brink of decline under the support of the Party, and have blossomed with bright flowers. Kunqu Opera, which Mei Lanfang has loved since childhood and has always advocated, is one of these types of dramas that have been revived and developed and improved.

Wang Weilin, a 119-year-old artist who has played the big gong all his life, told Mei Lanfang and others about the changes in his artistic life with great energy. Mei Lanfang has contacted many old and young actor representatives these days, among whom Shen Wenhui, a 19-year-old young actor of Han Opera, is a whole century younger than the old artist Wang Weilin. Faced with this situation, Mei Lanfang excitedly said that today, old artists are taken care of, old actors maintain the youth of art, and young actors are growing up in batches. Without the leadership of the Party, there would never be such great achievements.

On the road of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, "Changchun Film Studio" is the film studio with the longest history. Starting from "Bridge," the first art film of New China, "Changchun Film Studio" has produced many films that depict workers, peasants, and soldiers, reflecting the heroic images of workers and peasants in the revolutionary historical struggle and in socialist construction. At the group discussion of the Jilin Provincial Delegation, the reporter met Yama, the director of "Changchun Film Studio," and Li Yalin, a young actor in the film "Young People in Our Village." Yama praised that in recent years, various film studios have produced many films depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers, and provided workers, peasants, and soldiers with various good films of various themes and forms. He cited the newly released film "Across the Yellow River," mentioned by Comrade Zhou Yang in his report, as an example, to illustrate that some films that have achieved success are the results of implementing the Party's literary and artistic policy. This film was co-produced by "Changchun Film Studio" and Lanzhou Film Studio. The screenwriter of the film, Cheng Shirong, the head of the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe, and others have lived in the rural areas of Gansu for a long time, and have lived in Yongjing County and the Tao River construction site for more than a year. They have deep feelings for the farmers of Gansu, so the images of workers and peasants they created are vivid. He said that the facts of the national film achievements prove that any film that successfully depicts workers, peasants, and soldiers must be the result of going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, being familiar with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and understanding the ideological qualities of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The representatives from music, fine arts, dance, folk art, folk literature, photography, and other fields who attended this conference were all delighted with the great achievements of their professions and the entire literary and artistic work.

Fu Baoshi, an old painter who participated in the creation of the giant Chinese painting "So Many Splendid Rivers and Mountains," and his old colleague, the oil painter Wu Zuoren, excitedly talked about the tremendous achievements of fine arts creation they saw from this National Fine Arts Exhibition, especially the emergence of many good works reflecting real life and expressing class struggle in Chinese painting. They recalled that at the time of the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1953, when the first National Chinese Painting Exhibition was held, some Chinese painting works still seemed to have a "half-baked" taste in expressing modern themes. From today's many works, it seems that Chinese painting workers have used it very naturally in this regard. Fu Baoshi said that the improvement of painting lies in the improvement of people. This huge progress is the achievement of Chinese painting workers under the leadership of the Party, going deep into life and carrying out self-transformation.

Fu Baoshi was extraordinarily pleasantly surprised to find that most of the works in the exhibition were from the hands of young painters, and some of the authors had not even entered the gates of art schools in 1953; today, they have created many works with relatively good ideological and artistic qualities, such as "Waist-Cutting the Yellow River" painted by students of the Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Arts. He was extremely happy for the emergence of countless latecomers in the art world, especially for the large number of worker-peasant painters who emerged from the Great Leap Forward. In Pi County, Jiangsu Province, there are many peasant painters. Liang Chuankui, who came with him to participate in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, created good works full of revolutionary romanticism, such as "Airplane Breaks Corn Stalk."

He Luting, president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and musician, excitedly talked about how Chinese musicians have also created many successful large-scale symphonies, orchestral works, and instrumental solos. He listed several works by young authors reflecting the revolutionary history and the Great Leap Forward, such as "Happy River Chorus," "Liu Zhidang Piano Concerto," "Gada Meilin Cello Concerto," "Gada Meilin Symphonic Poem," and "Youth Piano Concerto." He said that these works express the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers with vivid musical images, have mature artistic skills and complete structural forms, and absorb the materials of folk songs and folk music, critically inherit the tradition of opera music, and learn from the essence of foreign music. They have begun to form their own national style and are loved by the masses. He Luting said that the reason why these works have achieved some success is because they are combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, familiar with the ideological feelings and musical language of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, absorbed the opinions of the masses, and are the result of giving full play to the spirit of large-scale cooperation and collective wisdom.

Water has a source, and trees have roots. All the achievements in our work and all the happiness in our lives are inseparable from the Party and Chairman Mao. The Chinese literary and artistic workers who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art naturally have a particularly strong feeling. This enthusiasm for thanking the Party and supporting the Party reached its peak on July 23. On this day, when our beloved leader Chairman Mao met with all the representatives at a happy moment, the representatives shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" with joy, expressing their love for the Party and Chairman Mao. On this day, many representatives were so excited that they could not fall asleep, and many representatives excitedly wrote poems praising the Party and Chairman Mao. The famous peasant poet Wang Lao Jiu expressed his thoughts in a poem, saying: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I wish you good fortune and longevity as long as the sky; you love the people and the people love you, and the red flag will always be planted throughout the country. ... In the future, I will work harder, shoulder a hoe and hold a pen; write more, write more, and promote more, and I will compete with the young people. ..."

    东风送暖百花开
    ——全国文代会代表欢呼我国文学艺术的光辉成就
    本报记者
    从祖国各个角落、各个文艺工作岗位前来参加第三次文代会的代表们，这几天完全沉浸在兴奋、激动和幸福的气氛中。在庄严的大会上，在小组讨论中，在休憩的时候，大家不住地谈论着。人们首先感到的是，十年多来，特别是大跃进的两年来，我国文学艺术的成就是多么辉煌，他们热情地欢呼毛主席文艺思想的伟大胜利，欢呼我国文学艺术在工农兵方向下百花齐放的巨大成就。
    听了周扬同志的报告后，北京市代表团的工人作家李学鳌、张福增，兴奋地去找同团的代表——长辛店机车车辆工厂的青年工人作者赵学勤，祝贺他们创作工厂史“北方的红星”的成功，急切地想要知道这部优秀作品的创作经过。因为周扬同志在报告中曾提到“北方的红星”是工农群众和革命干部拿起笔来写自己历史的可贵果实之一。赵学勤曾参加这部长达三十六万字的工厂史的编写工作，他用生动的事实说明，这部作品是集体智慧的结晶，是在工厂党委领导和专业作家帮助下，大搞群众运动的成果，这部作品的成功，有力地证明了“文艺工作中贯彻执行群众路线，积极发展工农兵群众的业余文学艺术运动”的正确性。在一年多的创作过程中，全厂近万名工人几乎都参加了座谈回忆，经过口述记录，写出了五千多篇回忆录，再经过细致的调查访问，得到外地工人的帮助，终于完整地、生动地记录了这个作为“二七”罢工发源地之一的工厂近六十年来革命斗争的历史。党的领导这根红线，是这部工厂史的主干，但开始编写时非常缺少这方面的材料，党和工人联系的线最初是怎样接上的呢？在深入发动群众回忆的过程中，六十多岁的老工人孙茂林提供了宝贵的资料，写成了全文的第一章“买烧饼馃子的人”。这样的事例举不胜举，保存在工人群众脑海中的许多珍贵的革命斗争史实，使这部作品有血有肉，成为生动的革命传统的教科书。
    在这次文代会上，飘拂着百花盛开的戏剧艺术花朵的芳香。来自祖国各地的五百多名戏剧界代表，个个春风满面，他们在交谈中，莫不歌颂祖国戏剧艺术几年来的巨大成就。
    梅兰芳已经是第三次参加全国文代大会了。他高兴地谈到：出席这次文代大会的戏剧界代表，比第二次文代会要多好几倍，代表的剧种也广泛得多。其中有许多剧种，都是在党的扶植下，从濒于衰亡的境地重新恢复了艺术生命，开出了鲜艳的花朵。梅兰芳从小爱好并一直提倡的昆曲，就是这些枯木逢春而得到发展、提高的剧种之一。
    打了一辈子大锣的一百一十九岁的老艺人王维林，精神奕奕地向梅兰芳等讲述了他艺术生活的变化。梅兰芳这些日子里接触了许许多多的老一辈和年青的演员代表，其中十九岁的汉剧青年演员沈文慧比王维林老艺人的年龄整整相差一个世纪。面对着这种情景，梅兰芳激动地说：今天老艺人得到了照顾，老演员保持着艺术的青春，而青年演员又在成批地成长起来。没有党的领导，绝不会有这样大的成果。
    在电影为工农兵服务的道路上，“长影”是历史最悠久的一个制片厂。从新中国第一部艺术片“桥”开始，“长影”生产了许多表现工农兵的影片，反映了工农群众在革命历史斗争中，在社会主义建设中的英雄形象。在吉林省代表团的小组讨论会上，记者遇见了“长影”厂长亚马和影片“我们村里的年青人”中的青年演员李亚林。亚马称赞近年来各制片厂生产了许多表现工农兵的影片，并为工农兵提供了各种题材的多种形式的好影片。他举出了新近公映的、周扬同志在报告中提到的影片“黄河飞渡”为例，说明一些获得成就的影片都是贯彻党的文艺方针的成果。这部影片是“长影”和兰州电影制片厂合摄的，影片的编剧、甘肃省话剧团团长程士荣等都曾在甘肃农村长期生活过，曾在永靖县和洮河工地住过一年多。他们对甘肃农民有着深厚的感情，所以塑造出的工农形象是活生生的。他说，全国电影成就的事实证明，凡是成功地表现工农兵的影片，一定是深入工农兵群众，熟悉工农兵生活，理解工农兵思想品质的结果。
    出席这次大会的音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺、民间文艺、摄影各方面的代表，都为自己的专业和整个文学艺术工作的巨大成就而欢欣。
    参加创作“江山如此多娇”巨幅国画的老画家傅抱石和他的老同事、油画家吴作人，兴奋地谈起从这次全国美术展览会看到的美术创作的巨大的成就，特别是国画中出现了许多反映现实生活和表现阶级斗争的好作品。他们回忆起1953年第二次文代会时期举行全国第一届国画展览会时，好些国画作品在表达现代主题上，还显得有“夹生饭”的味道，而从今天的许多作品看来，国画工作者在这方面已运用得很自然了。傅抱石说，画的提高，在于人的提高，这种巨大的进步，正是国画工作者在党的领导下，深入生活，进行自我改造所取得的成绩。
    傅抱石异常惊喜地发现，展览会上的作品，大部分出自年青画家之手，其中好些作者，在1953年甚至还没有跨进美术学校的大门；而今天他们竟已创作出许多思想性、艺术性都比较好的作品，例如东北鲁迅艺术学院学生所画的“腰斩黄河”等。他为美术界出现了无数的后来居上者，特别是从大跃进中涌现了大批工农画家，而感到无比的高兴。在江苏省邳县，就有很多农民画家，这次同他一起来参加文代会的梁传魁，就曾创作了“飞机碰断玉米秆”等充满革命浪漫主义色彩的好作品。
    上海音乐学院院长、音乐家贺绿汀兴奋地谈到我国音乐工作者也创作了许多成功的大型交响乐、乐队作品和乐器独奏曲。他列举了几部反映革命历史和大跃进的青年作者的作品“幸福河大合唱”，“刘志丹钢琴协奏曲”，“嘎达梅林大提琴协奏曲”，“嘎达梅林交响诗”，“青年钢琴协奏曲”。他说，这些作品以鲜明的音乐形象，表现了工农兵英雄人物，具有成熟的艺术技巧和完整的结构形式，而且吸取民歌、民间音乐的素材，批判地继承戏曲音乐传统，借鉴外国音乐的精华，开始形成了自己的民族风格，为广大群众所喜闻乐见。贺绿汀谈到这些作品所以获得一些成绩，都是由于和工农群众相结合，熟悉了工农思想感情和音乐语言，吸取了群众的意见，是发挥大协作精神和集体智慧的结果。
    水有源，树有根，我们工作中的一切成就，我们生活中的一切幸福，都是同党和毛主席分不开的。在毛泽东文艺思想哺育下成长起来的我国文艺工作者，这种感受自然而然是特别强烈的。这种感激党、拥护党的热情，在7月23日这天达到了最高峰。这天，当我们敬爱的领袖毛主席接见全体代表的幸福时刻，代表们欢喜若狂地同声高呼“毛主席万岁！”尽情地表达了自己对党和毛主席的热爱。这天，多少代表兴奋得不能入睡，许多代表激动地写下了歌颂党、歌颂毛主席的诗篇。著名的农民诗人王老九在诗中表达自己的心意说：“毛主席呀毛主席，祝你福寿与天齐；你爱人民民爱你，全国永远插红旗。……今后我更要鼓干劲，肩扛镢头手握笔；多编多写多宣传，要和青年比高低。……”
