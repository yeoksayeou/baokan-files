External Support and Self-Reliance
Tian Lianqian

After further implementing the policy of "agriculture as the foundation of the national economy," all sectors have strengthened their support for agricultural production, and this has produced tremendous results. The facts from the Nanjiao Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, are one example.

Nanjiao Commune is a place that has been "waterless since ancient times." Farmers have lived here for thousands of years, and water has always been an unsolvable problem. In years with sufficient rainfall, it is manageable, but in years of drought and lack of rain, even the water for people and livestock to drink becomes a problem. In the continuous severe droughts of the past two years, 34 out of the 37 villages in the commune suffered from water shortages for both people and livestock. However, now, Nanjiao Commune is no longer a "waterless since ancient times" place. There are now mechanical wells, reservoirs, and more mountain springs. Not only is drinking water for people and livestock no longer a problem, but the problem of irrigation water for farmland has also been initially resolved. Who unveiled the mystery of Nanjiao Commune being "waterless since ancient times"? Comrades from the Hydrogeological Team of the Shandong Provincial Geological Bureau first drilled three mechanical wells in this most water-scarce area. From this matter, we see once again how tremendous the effect can be when all sectors further strengthen their support for agriculture. Problems that farmers had been unable to solve for thousands of years were suddenly solved. From this matter, we also further understand that to accelerate the development of agriculture, we must further strengthen the support of all sectors for agriculture.

However, after all, developing agriculture is the business of the broad masses of farmers themselves. Only with the more active and enthusiastic efforts of the broad masses of farmers can China's agricultural production develop faster and better. External causes are conditions, internal causes are the basis, and external causes play a role through internal causes. Only with the more active and enthusiastic efforts of the broad masses of farmers can the support of all sectors for agriculture play a greater role and produce greater results. Doesn't the reality of Nanjiao Commune also best illustrate this issue? The efforts of geological workers found water sources in this "waterless since ancient times" land of Nanjiao Commune, and drilled three mechanical wells, which was a great victory; however, if the members of Nanjiao Commune did not actively work hard, the water source would only be a lovely water source, and the three mechanical wells could solve some problems, but not the fundamental problem, and the possibility would still not become a reality. The members of Nanjiao Commune did not weaken their own efforts after others strengthened their assistance, but greatly promoted their initiative and the spirit of self-reliance. With the assistance of geological workers, the commune members, with soaring enthusiasm, chiseled through more than six zhang of mountain rock and completed 38 wells in one go, found 68 mountain springs, and dug 19 small reservoirs, solving the irrigation problem for more than 20,000 mu of land; and they are still continuing their efforts, determined to solve the irrigation problem for the entire commune's land within two or three years.

The support of all sectors for agriculture, coupled with the redoubled efforts of the broad masses of farmers on the agricultural front, two forces combined into one, will surely make China's agriculture develop faster and better.

    别人支援和自力更生
    田连阡
    进一步贯彻“农业是国民经济发展的基础”的方针以后，各行各业加强了对农业生产的支援，并且产生了巨大的效果。山东历城县南郊公社的事实，就是例证之一。
    南郊公社是个“自古无水”的地方，农民在这里生活了几千年，水始终是个无法解决的难题。雨水充足的年头还好办，一遇天旱雨缺，不要说种地，连人喝马饮的水都会成为问题。去今两年的连续大旱，在公社的三十七个村庄中就有三十四个村子人畜断水。可是，现在，南郊公社再不是“自古无水”之地了。这里出现了机井、水库和更多的山泉，人喝马饮的水固然已经不是问题，连浇地灌溉的用水问题也初步解决了。是谁揭开了南郊公社“自古无水”之谜？山东省的地质局水文大队的同志们首先在这最缺水的地方打出了三眼机井。从这件事情上使我们再一次看到：各行各业进一步加强对农业的支援，会产生多么巨大的效果。几千年来农民没有解决的问题，一下子迎刃而解了。从这件事情上也使我们进一步理解：要加速农业的发展，就要进一步加强各行各业对农业的支援。
    但是，发展农业毕竟是广大农民自己的事情，只有广大农民更加主动积极地努力，我国的农业生产才能发展得更快更好。外因是条件，内因是根据，外因通过内因起作用。只有广大农民更加积极努力，各行各业对农业的支援才能发挥出更大的作用，产生更大的效果。南郊公社的事实不是也最好地说明了这个问题么？地质工作人员的努力，在南郊公社这块“自古无水”的土地上，找到了水源，并且打出了三眼机井，这是一个巨大的胜利；但是，如果南郊公社的社员们不积极努力，水源只是一个可爱的水源而已，三眼机井可以解决一些问题，然而却不能解决根本问题，可能性仍然变不成现实。南郊公社的社员们不是在别人加强援助后，减弱了自己的努力，而是大大发扬了主动精神，大大发扬了自力更生的精神。在地质工作人员的援助下，社员们以冲天的干劲凿开六丈多深的山石，一气打成了三十八眼井，找出了六十八个山泉，挖好了十九个小水库，解决了两万多亩土地的灌溉问题；并且还正在继续努力，决心在两三年内解决全社土地的灌溉问题。
    各行各业对农业的支援，加上农业战线上广大农民的加倍努力，两股劲合成一股劲，一定会使我国的农业发展得更快更好。
