　　Wang Zangxue is a Good Secretary Who is Both Civil and Military
　　He brought the ideology and work style of the working class to the rural small mine, gradually regularizing mine management and rapidly increasing ore production.
    (Our reporter Xu Renzhong reports) After being assigned by the organization to serve as the deputy secretary of the Party branch in the commune iron mine in Yanqing County in the suburbs of Beijing, Wang Zangxue, the workshop director of the Beijing Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory, promoted a rapid change in the mine's appearance with his exemplary actions and down-to-earth work style. This resulted in the mine's ore production in mid-to-late June and early July increasing by 23.1% compared to May.
    After arriving at the mine, Wang Zangxue immediately immersed himself in the reality of production, closely contacted the workers, asked and learned about things he didn't understand, took notes in a small notebook, and combined this with studying technical knowledge from books. When he encountered problems in his work, he would first carefully study them, and then discuss them with the secretary, deputy secretary, and mine manager, learning from their strengths and making up for his own shortcomings. In less than a month, Wang Zangxue had basically grasped the production situation of the mine.
    Wang Zangxue, who came from a fitter background, has the following major characteristic in his work: going down into the mine, laboring and consulting with the workers, leading other cadres to follow the mass line by setting an example. In the first few days of arriving at the mine, he chose the tunnel with the heaviest production task as his "experimental field," put on a willow hat and went down the mine with the workers. When someone said that he was the new deputy secretary, everyone was very moved. On June 17th, Wang Zangxue stayed in the 108 tunnel from the early shift to the late shift. During the shift, he worked with the workers to improve the operating methods of drilling and blasting. Before the shift, he explained the situation to the workers, announced the work plan for the day, organized the workers to cooperate with each other on the shift, with clear division of labor, and personally organized publicity and mobilization both underground and above ground, launching a labor emulation drive, which made the daily output of this tunnel increase by one time. The news that the deputy secretary, who had only been here for a few days, was going down to the mine to produce quickly spread throughout the mine, and also influenced other cadres to go down to the mine to work, which increased the daily ore output of the entire mine by 50% compared with the average daily output in May, creating the highest record since the mine was established.
    In his work, Comrade Wang Zangxue closely relied on the local Party organization, cooperated closely with rural cadres, frequently reported his work, actively provided rationalization proposals, and jointly studied the work, giving full play to the core role of the Party committee's collective leadership. At Wang Zangxue's suggestion, the entire mine quickly strengthened political and ideological work, improved the work system, strengthened the Party and League organizational life and the study of current affairs and policies for employees, and mobilized Party members and League members to set an example and play a backbone leading role among the masses. He adjusted the group personnel, analyzed and studied the political and ideological situation of the employees, promptly commended good people and good deeds, established role models, and promptly discovered and resolved existing problems. Previously, there was a tendency among employees to value the "foreign" and despise the "local," looking down on their own work and wanting to be transferred to large mines. After the Party committee discovered this problem, it immediately held a debate in conjunction with political study, mobilized the masses to speak out freely, and also adopted the method of individual talks, using the facts of the Great Leap Forward in the mine over the past two years to inspire workers to improve their class consciousness. In this way, the idea of valuing the "foreign" and despising the "local" among the workers began to change, and the attendance rate increased from 88% in May to the current 98%. Previously, ore was thrown everywhere, but now everyone realizes that the mine is home and the ore is treasure, and, like the harvest of grain in autumn, basically achieves "every grain returns home."
    On the basis of doing a good job in ideological work, Wang Zangxue mobilized employees to strengthen enterprise management. He used the facts he had experienced to introduce to the employees the necessity of establishing systems. According to his suggestion, the members of the mine Party committee, under collective leadership, each had a clear division of labor. At the same time, a number of practical management systems and a system for cadres to follow shifts in production were established and improved throughout the mine. In production, specific production plans and operation plans were arranged, and workers were mobilized to discuss them so that the plans were implemented to individuals. Competition and evaluation were carried out between people and between groups. After this series of work, a situation of rising production appeared.
    Wang Zangxue and the employees have only been building the mine together for a month, but it has brought about major changes to the entire mine. The rural cadres all felt that his spirit of going deep into the masses, working hard, and doing practical work was good, and they also went up the mountains and down the mines, which strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and improved the cadres themselves. The workers became friends with Wang Zangxue, saying that he "is our good secretary who is both civil and military."

　　王藏雪是能文能武的好书记
　　他把工人阶级的思想作风带到了农村小矿山，使矿山管理工作逐步走向正规，矿石产量迅速上升
    本报讯　记者徐人仲报道：北京市冶金机械修配厂车间主任王藏雪经组织分配，去郊区延庆县公社铁矿山任党支部副书记以后，以工人阶级的模范行动和踏踏实实的工作作风，促进矿山面貌迅速改变，使这个矿6月中下旬和7月上旬的矿石产量比5月份猛增23.1％。
    王藏雪来到矿山后，立即深入生产实际，密切联系工人群众，见不懂的事就问就学，用小本子记，并结合实际学习书本技术知识。工作中遇到了问题，就先认真研究，然后和书记、副书记、矿长一起讨论，学习他们的优点，补自己的不足。不到一个月，王藏雪就基本上摸熟了矿山的生产情况。
    钳工出身的王藏雪在工作中的最大特点是：到井下去，和工人同劳动、同商量，以身作则带动其他干部走好群众路线。他到矿上头几天，就选择生产任务最重的坑道作“试验田”，戴上柳条帽和工人一起下井，当有人说他就是新来的副书记时，大家十分感动。6月17日，王藏雪在一○八坑道从早班一直顶到晚班；在班上，和工人一起改进打眼、放炮的操作方法。他在班前向工人交底，公布当天作业计划，在班上组织工人相互配合，有明确分工，并亲自在井下井上组织宣传鼓动，开展劳动竞赛，使这个坑道日产量猛增一倍。才来不几天的副书记下井生产的消息迅速传遍全矿，也影响了其他干部纷纷下井劳动，使全矿矿石日产量比5月份平均日产量增加50％，创建矿以来最高纪录。
    王藏雪同志在工作中，紧紧依靠当地党组织，和农村干部亲密合作，经常汇报自己的工作情况，积极提供合理化建议，一起研究工作，充分发挥党委会集体领导的核心作用。在王藏雪建议下，全矿迅速加强了政治思想工作，健全了工作制度，加强了党团组织生活和职工的时事政策学习，发动党团员以身作则在群众中起骨干带头作用。调配了小组人员，并对职工的政治思想情况进行分析研究，及时表扬好人好事，树立标兵，对存在问题及时发现及时解决。以前职工中存在重洋轻土的思想，看不起自己的工作，想调到大矿山去。党委发现这个问题后，立即结合政治学习召开辩论会，发动群众大鸣大放，同时又采取个别谈心的办法，用两年来本矿大跃进的事实，启发工人提高阶级觉悟。这样，工人中重洋轻土的思想开始扭转了，出勤率由5月份的88％提高到现在的98％；以前矿石到处乱扔，现在人人认识到矿山是家，矿石是宝，像秋收时对粮食一样基本上做到“颗粒还家”。
    在做好思想工作的基础上，王藏雪发动职工加强企业管理，他用自己经历过的事实，向职工们介绍建立制度的必要性。根据他的建议，矿党委委员在集体领导下各有明确分工，同时在全矿建立和健全了一批切实可行的管理制度和干部跟班生产的制度。在生产上，具体安排生产计划和作业计划，发动工人讨论，使计划落实到人，在人与人、组与组之间展开竞赛和评比，经过这一系列的工作，生产上出现了节节高升的局面。
    王藏雪和职工们一起建设矿山时间仅仅一个月，但是给全矿带来了重大变化。农村干部都觉得他深入群众苦干实干的精神好，也纷纷上山下井，密切了干群关系，提高了干部自己。工人和王藏雪交成了朋友，说他“是我们能文能武的好书记”。
