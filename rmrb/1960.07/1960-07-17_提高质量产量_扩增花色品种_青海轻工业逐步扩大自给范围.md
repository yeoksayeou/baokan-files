　　Improving Quality and Output, Expanding Variety
　　Qinghai Light Industry Gradually Expands Self-Sufficiency

This newspaper reports that the situation in Qinghai Province, where various light industrial products were previously reliant on supplies from other regions, has changed. Currently, light industrial enterprises encompassing thirty-six sectors, including textiles, fur, leather, food, and papermaking, are distributed throughout the province. There is an increasing number of light industrial products made in the province on the market. According to statistics, among the current 3,700-plus daily necessities of light industrial products, over 1,000 products such as milk powder, alcohol, shoes, hats, clothing, leather, fur products, soap, matches, and wooden furniture have achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. Many products that could not be produced in the past, or were not even imagined, such as plastic products, rubber products, glass instruments, machine-made paper, blankets, various knitwear, canned goods, sugar, and beer, have also begun to be produced in large quantities.

Under the earnest implementation of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's directive to "actively expand variety, increase output, improve quality, and gradually expand the scope of self-sufficiency," light industrial enterprises in various regions have been producing products of increasingly high quality. The Kangning brand milk powder produced by the Kang Er Su Dairy Factory in Xining City has been rated first in the country for its quality, and has also received good reviews on the international market. Various carpets produced by the Qinghai Province Wool Processing Factory have reached export standards in quality and are very popular abroad. Other leather and fur products such as leather shoes and saddles are also sold to various places at home and abroad.

"Starting from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large" is a significant characteristic of the development of light industry in Qinghai. Before liberation, the industrial base of Qinghai Province was extremely weak. The so-called "Eight Great Factories," with the exception of the power plant, coal mine, and a repair shop that had a few small, dilapidated machines, the other factories were actually just small handicraft workshops. Including handicraft workers in the countryside, there were only ten handicraft trades in the province, including blacksmiths, carpenters, furriers, flour and vinegar makers, bricklayers, and lime burners. After liberation, socialist transformation was carried out on private industrial and commercial enterprises and individual handicraft workers, and a number of new light industrial enterprises were built. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, due to the resolute implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, a mass campaign to run industries was launched. People broke down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and in a very short period of time, more than 4,600 light industrial enterprises were set up in various parts of the province and in various people's communes, and more than 500 new products were trial-produced and produced. By the end of last year, the number of light industrial workers in the province had increased more than tenfold compared with the time of liberation, the total output value had increased more than elevenfold, and the variety of products had increased from more than thirty at the time of liberation to more than two thousand. In order to produce more and better light industrial products, and to strive to make most of the main products self-sufficient within this year, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution aimed at high output, high quality, multiple varieties, and low costs has swept the light industrial front in the province. Workers at the No. 1 Cloth Shoe Factory in Xining City have created various machines such as shoe edge wrapping machines and shoe sole cutting machines. Among them, the shoe edge wrapping machine increases work efficiency by 48 times, saving more than 1,400 catties of flour and 2,000 feet of cloth annually. The Light Industry Comprehensive Experimental Factory has improved the furnace charge formula and the furnace charge extraction method, so that the potassium dichromate content of red chrome reaches more than 98%. Recently, light industrial enterprises in the Xining area have launched a fierce attack on coal consumption and have achieved coal gasification in one fell swoop, saving an average of 30% of coal consumption. After coal gasification, not only has labor productivity been improved, but also the working conditions for high-temperature operations have been improved.

In expanding the source of raw materials and the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and materials, there have also been many innovations. After many experiments, the Qinghai Provincial Light Industry Research Institute has not only used Qinghai's special product, the Huang fish, to make new products such as smoked fish and fish floss, but also used fish intestines, fish bones, etc. to make 13 kinds of industrial products such as fish oil, fish flake glue, bone meal, and activated carbon. Among them, fish oil is further processed and refined to produce lubricating oil for high-grade precision instruments. The fish glue refined from fish maw is also an important export material.

While vigorously grasping the source of raw materials, the light industrial departments throughout the province have also established their own foundation for auxiliary materials and manufacturing technology and equipment. For example, it produces electrolytic salt and mirabilite needed for the paper and dye industries, and red chrome needed for the leather industry. In addition, the province's two light industrial machinery factories have successively manufactured various light industrial machinery such as small paper machines, milk powder sprayers, and sugar beet centrifuges to meet the needs of the increasingly developed light industrial technology and equipment.

### 提高质量产量　扩增花色品种　青海轻工业逐步扩大自给范围

　　提高质量产量　扩增花色品种
　　青海轻工业逐步扩大自给范围
    本报讯　青海省各种轻工业品一向依靠外地供应的局面，已经改变了。现在，包括纺织、皮毛、制革、食品、造纸等三十六个行业的轻工业企业，分布在全省范围内；市场上，本省所产的各种轻工业品越来越多。据统计，在当前日常必需的三千七百多种轻工业产品中，已经有奶粉、酒、鞋帽、服装、皮革、皮毛制品以及肥皂、火柴、木制家具等一千多种产品达到了自给或半自给。许多过去不能生产，甚至连想都不敢想的产品，如塑料制品、橡胶制品、玻璃仪器、机制纸、毛毯、各种针织品和罐头、食糖、啤酒等新产品，也都开始成批生产。
    各地轻工业企业在认真贯彻中共青海省委“积极扩大品种，增加产量，提高质量，逐步扩大自给范围”的指示下，产品质量越来越高。西宁市康尔素乳品厂生产的康宁牌奶粉，质量被评为全国第一，在国际市场上也得到了好评。青海省绒毛加工厂生产的各种地毯，质量已经达到出口标准，在国外很受欢迎。其它皮鞋、马鞍等皮革、皮毛制品也远销国内外各地。
      “白手起家，从无到有，从小到大”是青海轻工业发展中的显著特点。解放前，青海省的工业基础极为薄弱，所谓“八大工厂”，除电厂、煤矿和一个修械厂还有几件小的破旧机器外，其他几个工厂实际上只是一些小型的手工业作坊。包括农村中的手工业人员在内，全省手工业行业也只有铁工、木工、皮毛、粉醋、砖瓦、石灰等十个行业。解放后，对私营工商业和个体手工业者进行了社会主义改造，新建了一批轻工业企业。特别是1958年大跃进以来，由于坚决贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，掀起了全民办工业的热潮。人们破除迷信，解放思想，在很短的时间内，全省各地、各人民公社即办起了四千六百多个轻工业企业，试制和生产了五百多种新产品。截至去年年底，全省轻工业职工人数比解放时增加了十倍多，总产值增长了十一倍多，产品品种也由解放时的三十多种，发展到两千多种。为了生产更多更好的轻工业品，争取在今年内使主要产品大部达到自给，一个以高产、优质、多品种、低成本为目的的技术革新和技术革命高潮已经席卷全省轻工业战线。西宁市第一布鞋厂职工创造了包鞋边机，裁鞋底机等多种机具，其中包鞋边机提高工效四十八倍，全年可节省面粉一千四百多斤，布两千尺。轻工业综合实验厂由于改进了炉料配方和炉料浸提法，使红矾的重铬酸钾含量达到98％以上。最近，西宁地区各轻工业企业猛攻煤耗关，又一举实现了煤气化，平均节省煤耗30％。煤气化后，不仅提高了劳动生产率，还改善了高温操作的劳动条件。
    在扩大原料来源和原料、材料的综合利用方面，也有了许多创造。青海省轻工业研究所经过多次试验，不但利用青海特产的湟鱼制成了熏鱼、鱼松等新产品，还用鱼肠、鱼骨等制成了鱼油、鱼片胶、骨粉和活性炭等十三种工业用产品。其中鱼油经过进一步加工提炼，还制出了高级精密仪器的润滑油。用鱼鳔炼制的鱼胶又是重要的出口物资。
    在大抓原料来源的同时，全省各轻工业部门还建立了自己的辅助材料和制造技术装备的基础。如生产了造纸、染料工业需要的电解食盐和芒硝，皮革工业需要的红矾等。此外，全省的两个轻工业机械厂还先后制成了小型造纸机、奶粉喷雾机、制糖分蜜机等各种轻工业机械，以满足日益发展的轻工业技术装备的需要。
