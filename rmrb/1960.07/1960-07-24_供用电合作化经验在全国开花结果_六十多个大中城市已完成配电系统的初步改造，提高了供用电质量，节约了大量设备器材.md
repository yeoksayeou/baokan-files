Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The communist ideological product of China's Great Leap Forward—the experience of cooperative power supply and consumption (i.e., voltage increase, simplification, and four-in-one ring power supply) created in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, has blossomed and borne fruit in most parts of the country. At present, more than sixty large and medium-sized cities across the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Guangzhou, have completed the preliminary renovation of distribution systems and have been connected into various ring networks for cooperative power consumption. More than one hundred other cities are actively promoting this. This has not only improved the quality of power supply and consumption in these areas but also saved a large amount of equipment and materials. According to statistics from twenty-six provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, more than 1.5 million kVA of transformers, more than 6,400 kilometers of various wires and cables, and a large number of electrical poles, switches, distribution panels, relays, and other electrical equipment and materials have been withdrawn from the distribution networks.

Through this comprehensive reform of the distribution system, the urban power supply and consumption landscape has been completely renewed. In the past, due to the division of power supply into "public," "dedicated," "industrial," and "civilian," each factory and enterprise had its own uneconomical and unreasonable distribution and transformation equipment. Now, this phenomenon has been eliminated, and it has been replaced by unified and centralized power supply and consumption, with unified internal power consumption within factories, unified power consumption between factories, unified industrial and civilian electricity, and unified factory power grids and regional power grids. Therefore, it not only strengthens the cooperative relationship between units, increases voltage, and makes power supply and consumption safer and more reliable, but also reduces power loss, saves a large number of transformation equipment and materials, and powerfully promotes production. For example, after Harbin fully implemented the four-in-one ring power supply in seventy districts throughout the city, it solved the problem of power shortage for more than 170 factories, and also used the dismantled equipment to erect sixty kilometers of lines for the rural areas in the suburbs. Because the city changed its power supply method, it has now decided to completely reduce the large number of new and expanded transformation equipment planned for this year.

Currently, many cities that have completed cooperative power supply and consumption, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing, are also developing towards a higher-level large-area closed-loop network power supply. The main content of this closed-loop network is to connect the power supply system covering millions of square meters or even the entire city, from the original radial (one transformer serving several users) power supply into a ring-shaped network power supply method. In this way, the transformer equipment connected to a network can exchange resources and adjust themselves. Even if there is a sudden load change, it can be jointly borne by each transformer, so that the production of power users will not be immediately affected.

The work of promoting voltage increase, simplification, and four-in-one ring power supply in various regions is carried out in batches and phases under the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, through large-scale mass movements, so the progress is extremely rapid, and it is generally completed within one or two months. Recently, inspired by the four-in-one ring power supply, cities such as Shenyang and Harbin are also promoting the experience of ring power supply in urban water supply, gas supply, and transportation. Some areas, on the basis of four-in-one power supply and consumption, have also organized the electrical workers and spare equipment originally scattered in various enterprises.

### 供用电合作化经验在全国开花结果  六十多个大中城市已完成配电系统的初步改造，提高了供用电质量，节约了大量设备器材

    供用电合作化经验在全国开花结果
    六十多个大中城市已完成配电系统的初步改造，提高了供用电质量，节约了大量设备器材
    据新华社23日讯　我国大跃进中的共产主义思想产物——黑龙江哈尔滨市创造的供用电合作化（即升压、简化、四合一环行供电）的经验，已经在绝大部分地区开花结果。目前，全国有北京、上海、天津、武汉、沈阳、广州等六十多个大中城市，已经完成配电系统的初步改造，联结成了合作用电的各种环行网络。另有一百多个城市还在积极推广。这样，既提高了这些地区供用电的质量，也节省了大量设备器材。据二十六个省、市、自治区的统计，就已经从配电网上撤回变压器一百五十多万千伏安，各种电线电缆六千四百多公里，以及大量的电杆、开关、配电盘、继电器等电气设备和器材。
    通过这一配电系统的全面改革，城市的供用电面貌已经焕然一新。过去由于供电有“公用”、“专用”，“工业用”“民用”之分，而形成各个工厂企业各有一套配电和变电设备的不经济不合理现象，现在已经消灭，代之而实行的是工厂内部用电合一、工厂与工厂用电合一，工业和民用电合一、厂用电网和地区电网合一的统一而集中的供、用电。因而，不但密切了各单位的协作关系，提高了电压，使供用电更加安全可靠，还减少了电力损耗，节约了大批变电设备和器材，有力地促进了生产。例如哈尔滨在全市七十个地区全面实行四合一环行供电后，解决了一百七十多个工厂缺电少电问题，还用拆下的设备为郊区农村架设了六十公里的线路。这个市由于改变了供电方式，今年计划新建和扩建的大量变电设备，现在也决定全部削减。
    现在，北京、上海、南京等许多已经完成供用电合作化的城市，还在向更高一级的大面积闭式网络供电方向发展。这种闭式网络主要内容是把面积达几百万平方米甚至整个城市的供电系统，从原来辐射形（一个变压器管几个用户）的供电并连成为环形网状的供电方式。这样，连在一个网上的变压设备就可以互通有无，自行调剂，即使发生急剧负荷变化，也可以由各变压器共同负担，不致立刻影响用电户生产。
    各地推行升压、简化、四合一环行供电的工作，是在省市委统一领导下，通过大搞群众运动的方式分批分期进行的，因而进展极快，一般都在一、两个月内就全部完成。最近，沈阳、哈尔滨等城市还由于四合一环行供电的启发，在城市供水、供煤气以及交通运输等方面，也正在推广环行供电的经验。有些地区在四合一供用电的基础上，把原来分散在各企业的电气工人、备用设备也组织了起来。
