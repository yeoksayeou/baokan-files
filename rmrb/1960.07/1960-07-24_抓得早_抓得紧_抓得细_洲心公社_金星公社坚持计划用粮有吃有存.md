　　Zhouxin Commune and Jinxing Commune Persist in Planned Grain Use, Having Food to Eat and Surplus to Store

　　(Our Newspaper News) The Zhouxin People's Commune in Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, taking production brigades as units, while uniformly focusing on the harvesting and management of grain, persists in planned grain use and economical grain use, ensuring that grain is not only harvested meticulously and managed safely, but also used rationally.

　　Since the autumn harvest last year, the Zhouxin Commune, in addition to retaining enough seeds and sufficient rations, has also retained 3.36 million jin of fodder grain and 1.61 million jin of reserve grain. According to statistics, from the autumn harvest last year to the end of May this year, a total of 11,400 households had surplus grain, accounting for 92% of the total number of households in the commune. The Zhouxin Commune Party Committee, after the bumper late rice harvest last year, attached great importance to the work of grain harvesting, management, and use. The production brigades implemented the method of meticulous harvesting and threshing, unified weighing, and unified storage, and established and improved the grain management system based on the principles of dedicated grain for dedicated storage, dedicated grain for dedicated use, dedicated grain for dedicated accounts, and dedicated personnel for safekeeping.

　　Grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping meticulously are the primary experiences of Zhouxin Commune in doing a good job of planned grain use and economical grain use. The Zhouxin Commune grasped the work of economy from the beginning of harvesting, promoting the distribution principle of "taking into account both the state and the commune, making comprehensive arrangements, looking ahead and behind, leaving room for maneuver, careful calculation, and long-term planning." In response to the erroneous thinking of the upper-middle peasants who generally wanted to distribute and eat more and not build reserves, a wide-ranging debate on "Is planned grain use, using surplus to compensate for deficiencies good, or is eating and using lavishly good?" was conducted among the masses. In addition, the production brigades promptly commended conservation models, so that the spirit of planned grain use and economical grain use and grain distribution policies penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people.

　　On this basis, the Zhouxin Commune Party Committee and the general branches of each brigade successively dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the lower levels to check the implementation of plans and the implementation of policies, and to help make monthly and meal-by-meal grain use plans, so that the work of planned grain use and economical grain use was further implemented.

　　(Our Newspaper News) The Jinxing People's Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, has long adhered to planned grain use, and its members eat their fill and eat well. Most canteens still have grain in storage, and they can connect to the autumn grain harvest without using summer grain. Because the commune members have grain to eat and surplus to store, their enthusiasm for production has always been very high.

　　Shortly after communization, the canteens of Jinxing Commune implemented planned grain use. Based on the principles of eating more during busy farming seasons and less during slack seasons, eating more on sunny days and less on rainy days, eating more for strong laborers and less for weak laborers, and matching coarse and fine grains, the commune formulated an annual grain consumption plan and implemented phased arrangements. Because the commune has always earnestly implemented these methods, the members have been able to eat with surplus, and now everyone in the commune has more than 100 jin of reserve grain.

　　The experience of Jinxing Commune proves that planned grain use must first grasp ideology. The Commune Party Committee seized the seasons of wheat harvest and autumn harvest when new grain was on the market, and on the one hand, conducted education among the masses on diligence and thrift in running the commune and diligence and thrift in managing the household, and at the same time widely summarized and publicized the good experiences of the masses in managing the household diligently and thriftily, and established a good atmosphere of diligence and thrift. After this year's summer harvest, the commune organized more than 400 propaganda personnel to launch a campaign to promote planned grain use.

　　Grasping the processes of harvesting, managing, and using grain from start to finish is another reason why Jinxing Commune has done a good job in planned grain use. From the beginning of the grain harvest, the commune first tightly grasped the implementation of grain purchase quotas, seeds, rations, and feed grain. The seeds, rations, feed grain, and reserve grain were stored in separate warehouses, dedicated grain for dedicated use, and dedicated personnel for dedicated management. This year, the commune, management district, and production team have further established grain management committees at all levels with the participation of member representatives, responsible for grain arrangement, management, planned grain use, and other tasks, making grain management work more meticulous and further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses.

　　Each canteen in Jinxing Commune has a vegetable garden, and each person often eats three jin of fresh vegetables every day. All eighty-nine canteens in the commune have pig farms.

    抓得早  抓得紧  抓得细
    洲心公社  金星公社坚持计划用粮有吃有存
    本报讯　广东清远县洲心人民公社以生产大队为单位，在统一抓好粮食的收刈和管理工作的同时，坚持计划用粮，节约用粮，使粮食不仅收得精细，管得安全，而且用得合理。
    洲心公社从去年秋收后，除留足种子和足够的口粮外，还留有饲料粮三百三十六万斤，储备粮一百六十一万斤。据统计，从去年秋收后到今年5月底止，有节余粮食的农户共一万一千四百户，占这个社的农户总数92％。洲心公社党委在去年晚造丰收以后，就十分重视做好粮食的收、管、用工作。各生产大队实行了精收细打和统一过秤、统一入库的办法，并根据专粮专仓，专粮专用，专粮专账和专人保管的原则，建立和健全粮食管理制度。
    抓得早，抓得紧和抓得细，是洲心公社做好计划用粮，节约用粮的首要经验。洲心公社从收刈一开始，就抓紧节约工作，宣传“国家公社兼顾，全面安排，瞻前顾后，留有余地，精打细算，细水长流”的分配原则。针对上中农普遍存在的多分多吃、不搞储备的错误思想，在群众中广泛进行了“计划用粮，以丰补歉好，还是大吃大用好”的大鸣大放大辩论。此外，各生产大队还及时表扬节约模范，使计划用粮和节约用粮精神和粮食分配政策深入人心。
    在这个基础上，洲心公社党委和各大队总支先后派出大批干部深入下层，检查计划落实和政策贯彻情况，帮助作好按月、按餐用粮计划，从而使计划用粮和节约用粮工作进一步得到落实。
    本报讯　四川省南部县金星人民公社长期坚持计划用粮，社员吃得饱、吃得好，大部分食堂还有存粮，不动用夏粮就可以接上秋粮登场。全社社员由于粮食有吃有存，生产干劲一直很高。
    金星公社在公社化后不久，各食堂就实行了计划用粮。对社员口粮本着农忙多吃、农闲少吃，晴天多吃、雨天少吃，劳力强的多吃、劳力弱的少吃和粗细配搭的原则，制订了全年吃粮计划，实行分段安排。由于全社始终认真执行了这些办法，社员吃粮做到有吃有存，现在全社每人都有储备粮一百多斤。
    金星公社的经验证明，计划用粮首先要抓思想。公社党委抓住麦收和秋收两次新粮上市季节，一方面深入群众进行勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育，同时广泛总结和宣传群众中勤俭持家、节约过日子的好经验，树立了勤俭节约的风尚。今年夏收以后，全社又组织了四百多名宣传大军展开计划用粮的宣传。
    收、管、用一抓到底，是金星公社计划用粮搞得好的另一个原因。从粮食收获开始，全社首先紧紧抓好征购粮、种子、口粮、饲料粮落实工作。把种子、口粮、饲料粮和储备粮分仓储存，专粮专用，专人专管。今年公社、管理区、生产队还进一步层层建立了有社员代表参加的粮食管理委员会，负责粮食安排、管理、计划用粮等各项工作，使粮食管理工作更加细致，并进一步调动了群众积极性。
    金星公社每个食堂都有蔬菜园，每天每人经常吃到三斤鲜菜。全社八十九个食堂都有猪场。
