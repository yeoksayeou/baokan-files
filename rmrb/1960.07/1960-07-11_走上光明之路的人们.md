　　People Walking on the Path of Light
　　By our correspondent Zhou Yizhi
    In mid-June, I left Ulan Bator to visit the grasslands of northern Mongolia.

    The car sped across the verdant grass. The boundless pasture, like a vast velvet carpet, stretched all the way to the distant horizon. Outside the car window, clumps of blue irises and patches of yellow wild chrysanthemums constantly appeared, like jewels and gold stars adorning the carpet. The air on the grassland was cool and permeated with a charming grassy fragrance. The car passed through one large pasture after another. Whenever some yurts appeared in front, there were many herds of horses, cattle, or sheep scattered around. My Mongolian comrades told me that these were the residential points of cooperatives. Mongolia's animal husbandry has been entirely collectivized, so the herds grazed by these residential points are much larger than in the past.

    After several days of travel, we arrived at the "Path of Light" cooperative in后杭爱 province.

    The cooperative's director, Namjil, accompanied me to the second sheep production team to visit the advanced herdsman, Wu Lemeng. We entered his yurt, and the hostess immediately picked up the copper kettle, filled each guest's bowl with milk tea, and busily brought out milk skin, milk tofu, milk snacks, and sugar. As she greeted the guests to drink tea, she scooped out five or six bowls of yogurt from the wooden bucket beside her and filled the table. Mongolian herdsmen are hospitable, leaving a very kind impression at first meeting.

    Wu Lemeng told us that this year there was enough rain, the grass was lush, and the sheep were gaining weight. His flock of sheep had already had two hundred and forty-three ewes give birth to lambs, all of which survived. These little lambs were all delivered by his old partner. She takes care of them like her own children, feeding them some mare's milk every day to prevent them from getting upset stomachs. Some lambs cannot get enough milk from their mothers, so she cooks a gruel to feed them. Wu Lemeng said that doing production now is completely different from when they worked individually in the past. In the past, when we raised a herd of livestock by ourselves, the two of us were busy from morning till night, and if we took care of the sheep, we couldn't take care of the cattle and horses. The work was very complicated and tiring. We didn't have the strength to build sheds and pens, nor could we prepare winter fodder for the livestock. Every winter, we lived with worry. In that harsh season, the herds spent the winter on the empty grasslands, in the freezing snow. Everything was left to fate, and perhaps one day, a heavy snowstorm would destroy all your livestock. Now the cooperative has more people and more strength. Horses, cattle, and sheep are grazed separately, which is better managed. There is sufficient fodder prepared for winter and spring, and there are also people responsible for building sheds and pens. Not only is there a guarantee for developing production, but the threat of natural disasters is not so terrible.

    Wu Lemeng stopped speaking at this point. He thoughtfully raised his hand, rubbed his eyes, remained silent for a while, and then said: People who are not familiar with animal husbandry production do not easily understand the importance of sheds and pens to herdsmen. If I had had sheds and pens earlier, my eye would not have gone blind. It was then that I noticed that Wu Lemeng's right eye was blind.

    This old herdsman has lived on the grassland for sixty years, and his history alternates between disaster and happiness. He told us the story of how he lost his eye.

    One winter, the snow fell particularly heavily, and the pasture was covered with knee-deep snow. No matter how hard the livestock tried with their mouths and hooves, they could not dig through such thick snow. They could not eat anything. Every day, Wu Lemeng and his wife laboriously raked open an area the size of a yurt, and as soon as the withered grass was exposed, the hungry herds rushed over to grab it. The weak livestock that could not squeeze in cried pitifully on the side, one after another, falling to the ground unable to get up. At that time, there were no cooperatives in this area, and individual herdsmen were too busy taking care of themselves. Who could come to help them? Watching the livestock they had painstakingly raised die like this was like a knife cutting their hearts. But the old man in the sky was not willing to stop tormenting people. One day, a blizzard suddenly swept across the grassland, and the cattle and sheep were frightened and scattered in all directions. Wu Lemeng saw his five cows running desperately with the wind, and he rushed out of the yurt, regardless of everything. The violent wind and snow raged madly, and the sky and the earth seemed to merge into one, making it impossible to distinguish them. Wu Lemeng followed closely behind the blurry shadows of the five cows, chasing them all night. The cows were trapped in the deep snow and could not run. Wu Lemeng reached them, but there was no way to save them. In the end, all five cows froze to death. The blizzard lasted for three consecutive days, and Wu Lemeng and his wife fought in the wind and snow, battling the blizzard for the sake of the herd. This natural disaster took away their five cows and more than forty sheep.

    When the blizzard stopped, Wu Lemeng was exhausted. He collapsed in the yurt, his eyes filled with a white blur, unable to see anything. His two frozen legs were even more tormenting, hurting so badly that he could hardly bear it. In this grassland, there was only their lonely yurt. At this disastrous moment, only his wife, with whom he depended on for life, was his only relative. His wife applied yak oil to his frozen legs every day, and after more than ten days, he was barely able to stand up and walk. One eye gradually regained its sight, but the other eye could no longer see anything.

    Wu Lemeng said that in the grassland, it is very difficult for individual herdsmen to resist such major natural disasters. Therefore, the herdsmen urgently felt the need for mutual assistance and cooperation. In 1942, the Party and the government led them to organize a pastoral production cooperative here, which was the predecessor of the "Path of Light" cooperative. Since joining the cooperative, their situation has changed greatly. Wu Lemeng said that now, the livestock he grazes is six or seven times more than his own livestock when he was working individually. He works more conscientiously and meticulously, but he does not worry and strain himself as much as he did in the past. In particular, in terms of life, there is much more security now than in the past. Last year, the two of them did more than eight hundred workdays and received more than three thousand tugriks (Mongolian currency), six sheep, and a horse at the end of the year. They also have privately owned livestock: two dairy cows, two stallions, and five ewes. The two of them are very well off for food, clothing, and other household expenses all year round. When working individually, they could only rely on their own dozens of livestock, and there was no other income at all. Once a disaster year struck, their lives would immediately face problems. Now that they have the cooperative as a strong backer, they don't have to worry about anything.

    Wu Lemeng's feeling was not formed in a day or two. Over the past ten years, everything that has happened in the cooperative has been deeply imprinted in his mind. He remembers that when the cooperative was first established, there were only twenty-six members and two hundred and forty-four livestock. Now, the number of members has increased to eight hundred and ninety households, and the livestock has developed into more than forty-seven thousand head. The cooperative owns nearly three hundred thousand hectares of land, everywhere there are green pastures. This year, the mechanized farming station plowed hundreds of hectares of land for the cooperative. Those newly cultivated lands are so fertile, black and shiny, as if mixed with some oil. Such land can not only grow grain and fodder, but can even be called to grow golden leaves. The cooperative has sown wheat, barley, oats, and vegetables on these lands. This means that a new way of life has begun. They no longer simply rely on natural pastures to live on. They will eat the grain they grow themselves and have their own reliable fodder base. The settled life they have longed for for many years is about to be realized. In the past, people could not finish eating cow and sheep milk and had to pour it away barrel by barrel. Now, the cooperative has established a dairy processing plant. Every year, the income from dairy products alone can reach two hundred and seventy thousand tugriks... All of this makes Wu Lemeng feel happy from the bottom of his heart. He feels that the road of the cooperative is getting wider and wider, and his life is becoming more and more secure. Wu Lemeng said that as long as he and his old partner can work for one more day, they will do their best to work for the cooperative for one more day. In the future, they will rely on the cooperative to spend a happy old age.

    Leaving Wu Lemeng's yurt, we went to the fourth residential point of the fifth production team. There are a total of eleven herdsmen households here, responsible for raising two hundred dairy cows. Three male laborers are responsible for grazing the cattle, eleven women are responsible for milking, and seven strong male laborers are responsible for construction and other side businesses. Every summer, the herdsmen drive the livestock to the summer camps and graze in the nearby pastures. In winter, both people and livestock return to the winter camps. There are sheds and pens, fodder prepared for the winter, bathrooms, red entertainment rooms, and sports grounds. Even in the event of a blizzard, the livestock are kept in sheds and pens, and will not be lost, let alone freeze or starve to death. With the livestock secured, people's lives are more stable.

    The herdsmen of the fourth residential point are very active in carrying out political and cultural studies and recreational activities. They collectively read the newspaper for two hours every Monday and Thursday, study culture on Tuesdays and Fridays, clean up on Wednesdays, engage in recreational activities on Saturdays, and hold a summary meeting on Sundays to arrange the work for the following week. Every herdsman has their own labor plan.

    This residential point has an amateur art group. That day, they specially performed some programs for us, including Mongolian folk songs, dances, and poetry recitations. Many herdsmen came to watch the art performance. The head of the residential point, Tu Muna Shun, boasted to me: "These children have even performed in Ulan Bator!"

    The cooperative director, Namjil, told me that in recent years, the public economy of the "Path of Light" cooperative has greatly developed. At the beginning of 1958, only about 50% of the herdsmen households in this area were members of the cooperative. In the second half of 1958, like other parts of the country, there was a high tide of the cooperative movement here. In the autumn of 1959, comprehensive cooperation was realized. Subsequently, the company launched a movement to rejoin the society with retained livestock, and members voluntarily handed over more than 10,000 retained livestock to the cooperative. At present, the company is stepping up the construction of settlement. The whole company is divided into six production teams, each team has several residential points. This year, all residential points must have sheds and pens. Red entertainment rooms, bathrooms and warehouses are being built in the center of each production team, and residential houses will also be built in each residential point in succession, and all of them can be settled down before 1965.

　　走上光明之路的人们
　　本报记者　周毅之
    6月中旬，我离开乌兰巴托，到蒙古北部的草原去访问。
    汽车在绿茸茸的草地上奔驰，无边无际的草场，像一张宽阔的天鹅绒地毡，一直铺到遥远的天边。车窗外，不断地出现一丛丛蓝色的马兰花、一片片黄色的野菊，好像缀在地毡上的宝石和金星。草原上空气沁凉，弥漫着迷人的草香。汽车穿过一片又一片大草场，每当前面出现一些蒙古包的时候，周围就散布着许多马群、牛群或羊群。同行的蒙古同志告诉我，这是合作社的居民点。蒙古的畜牧业已经全部集体化了，因此，这些居民点所放牧的畜群，比过去庞大得多。
    经过几天的旅行之后，我们来到后杭爱省的“光明之路”合作社。
    社主任那木吉格陪我到第二牧羊生产队，访问先进牧民武勒孟。我们走进他的蒙古包，女主人立即提起铜壶，给每个客人斟满一碗奶茶，又忙着端出奶皮、奶豆腐、奶点心和糖。她一面招呼客人喝茶，一面从旁边的木桶里盛出五、六碗酸奶，摆满了一桌。蒙古牧民好客，初见面就给人留下非常亲切的印象。
    武勒孟告诉我们，今年雨水足，草茂盛，羊正在长膘。他放牧的羊群，已经有二百四十三只母羊下小羔，全部成活。这些小羊羔都是他的老伴亲自接下来的。她照顾它们，就像照顾自己的孩子一样，每天都给小羊羔喂一些马奶，使它们不坏肚子。有些小羊羔吃母羊的奶吃不饱，她就煮面糊糊加喂。武勒孟说，现在搞生产，跟过去单干的时候完全不同了。过去，
  自己养一群牲畜，两口子一天忙到晚，顾得羊来就顾不得牛和马，工作很复杂，很劳累。自己没有力量修棚圈，也不能给牲口准备过冬的饲料。每年冬天，总是忧心忡忡地过日子。在那严寒的季节，畜群就在空荡荡的草原上，在冰天雪地里过冬。一切都听天由命，说不定哪天，一场大风雪就能毁灭你的全部牲畜。现在合作社人多力量大，马、牛、羊分开放牧，管得比较好。冬春的饲料准备充足，还有专人负责修盖棚圈，不仅发展生产有保障，自然灾害的威胁也不那么可怕了。
    武勒孟说到这里就停住了。他若有所思地举起手，揉了揉眼睛，沉默了一会，接着说：不熟悉畜牧业生产的人，不容易了解棚圈对牧民的重要。如果我过去早有棚圈的话，我的这只眼睛就不会瞎了。这时候我才注意到，原来武勒孟的右眼是瞎的。
    这个老牧民在草原上生活了六十年，他的历史交替着灾难和幸福。他给我们讲了他怎样失去一只眼睛的故事。
    有一年冬天，雪下得特别大，草场上积着没膝的厚雪。牲畜用它们的嘴和蹄，怎样也扒不开那么厚的雪，它们什么都吃不到。武勒孟夫妇每天艰难地耙开像蒙古包那样大小的一块地方，枯草刚刚露出来，饥饿的畜群就拥过去抢着吃。挤不进去的瘦弱的牲畜，在旁边凄凉地嗥叫，一只又一只，倒在地上爬不起来了。那时候，这一带地方还没有合作社，个体牧民们都自顾不暇，谁能够来帮助他们呢？眼看着费尽心血抚养起来的牲畜这样死去，心里真是像刀割一样难过。但是，老天爷对人的折磨还不肯停止。有一天，草原上忽然刮起暴风雪，牛羊吓得四散奔逃。武勒孟看见自己的五头牛顺着风向拼命往前跑，他也不顾一切地从蒙古包里追出去。暴烈的风雪疯狂地刮着，天和地好像合成了一片，简直没有办法把它们分开来。武勒孟紧紧地跟在五头牛的模糊的影子后面，追了一整夜。牛陷在深雪里，跑不动了。武勒孟赶到跟前，也没法营救它们。结果，五头牛全都冻死了。暴风雪连续刮了三天，武勒孟夫妇就在风雪里搏斗，和暴风雪争夺畜群。这一场天灾夺去了他们的五头牛和四十多只羊。
    风雪停止了，武勒孟也精疲力竭了。他倒在蒙古包里，眼前白茫茫一片，什么都看不见了。两条冻坏的腿更折磨人，疼得简直没法忍受。这一片草原上，只有他们一个孤零零的蒙古包，在这灾难重重的时刻，只有跟他相依为命的妻子是他唯一的亲人。妻子每天用山羊油给他涂冻坏的腿，过了十多天，他才能够勉强站起来走路，一只眼睛也渐渐恢复了视力，但是另一只眼睛却永远看不见东西了。
    武勒孟说，在草原上，遇到这样大的自然灾害，个体牧民是很难抵抗的。因此，牧民们都迫切感到需要互助合作。1942年，党和政府就领导他们，在这里组织了一个牧业生产合作社，这就是“光明之路”合作社的前身。自从加入合作社之后，他们的情况就发生了很大的变化。武勒孟说，现在，他所放牧的牲畜，比单干时自己的牲畜多六、七倍，工作更加认真细致了，但是，却不像过去那样操心劳神。特别是生活方面，现在比过去有保障多了。去年，他们夫妻二人共做了八百多个劳动日，年底分得现金三千多图格里克（蒙币）、六只羊、一匹马。他们还有自留牲畜奶牛二头、公马二匹和母羊五只，两个人一年四季吃穿和其它家用都很富裕。单干时只能指望着自己的几十头牲畜，其它收入完全没有，一旦遭逢个灾年，生活马上就发生问题。现在有了合作社这个大靠山，什么都不愁了。
    武勒孟的这种感觉，不是一天两天形成的。十多年来，合作社所发生的每一件事，都深深地印在他的脑海里。他记得，当合作社刚刚成立的时候，只有二十六户社员，二百四十四头牲畜。现在，社员的数目已经增加到八百九十户，牲畜发展成四万七千多头。合作社拥有将近三十万公顷土地，到处是绿油油的牧场。今年，机耕站替合作社翻耕了几百公顷土地。那一片片新垦地，是多么肥沃啊，黑闪闪地，像是用什么油掺拌过似的。这样的土地，不仅可以长出粮食和饲料，简直可以叫它长出黄金叶子。社里在这些土地上播种了小麦、大麦、燕麦和蔬菜。这就意味着，一种新的生活方式已经开始了。他们不再单纯依靠天然牧场过日子了，他们要吃自己种出来的粮食，要有自己的可靠的饲料基地了。多少年来想望的定居生活快要实现了。过去，人们吃不完的牛羊奶，不得已一桶一桶地倒掉。现在，合作社办了奶品加工厂，每年光是奶产品一项，就可以收入二十七万图格里克……。所有这一切，都使武勒孟从心底里感到高兴。他觉得，合作社的路是越走越宽了，自己的生活也过得越来越踏实了。武勒孟说，他和他的老伴只要一天还能劳动，就尽力为合作社工作一天。将来，他们要依靠合作社度过幸福的晚年。
    离开武勒孟的蒙古包，我们去第五生产队的第四居民点。这里共有十一户牧民，负责饲养二百头奶牛。三个男劳动力专管放牛，十一个妇女担任挤奶工作，七个身强力壮的男劳动力，专管建筑和其它副业。每年夏季，牧民们赶牲口到夏营地，在附近的牧场游牧。到了冬天，人畜都回到冬营地。那里有棚圈，有准备过冬的饲料，有浴室、红色娱乐室和运动场。即使遇到暴风雪，牲口关在棚圈里，不会散失，更不会冻死、饿死。牲畜有了保障，人的生活也更加安定了。
    第四居民点的牧民在开展政治、文化学习和文娱活动方面很积极。他们每星期一、四集体读报二小时，星期二、五学文化，星期三搞清洁卫生，星期六文娱活动，星期天开总结会，安排下周的工作。每个牧民都有自己的劳动计划。
    这个居民点有一个业余文艺小组。那天，他们特地给我们表演了一些节目，有蒙古民歌舞蹈和诗朗诵等。许多牧民都来看文艺演出。居民点的组长图木那顺向我夸耀说：“这些孩子还上过乌兰巴托演出呢！”
    社主任那木吉格告诉我，最近几年，“光明之路”合作社的公有经济有很大发展。1958年初，这个地方只有50％左右的牧户是合作社社员。1958年下半年，这里也和全国其它各地一样，出现合作化运动的高潮。1959年秋天，实现了全面合作化。随后，社里又掀起一个自留牲畜再入社运动，社员们自愿把一部分自留牲畜一万多头交给合作社。目前，社里正在加紧定居的建设工作。全社共分六个生产队，每队有几个居民点。今年内，全部居民点都要有棚圈。各生产队中心正在建设红色娱乐室、浴室和仓库等，各居民点也要陆续建设住宅，1965年以前就可以全部定居下来。（附图片）
