Xinhua News Agency, July 13th. New York Dispatch: According to a recent report in the "Worker's Weekly," five hundred Black and White residents of Chicago held a rally in Washington Park in that city, demanding that U.S. President Eisenhower immediately release Henry Winston, a leader of the American Communist Party and a Black leader.
	Speakers at the rally condemned the inhumane and brutal persecution of Winston. Clay Lee pointed out that the government authorities discriminated against Winston because he was both Black and a communist. He called on everyone to redouble their efforts to fight for Winston's freedom.
	The entire audience listened in solemn silence as Green read aloud Winston's wife's appeal for her husband's freedom in an impassioned voice.
	The protest rally lasted for two hours. The rally was organized by mass organizations such as the Smith Act (Victims) Family Committee, the Chicago Committee for Democratic Rights, the Un-American Heritage Foundation, and the Washington Park Forum.
