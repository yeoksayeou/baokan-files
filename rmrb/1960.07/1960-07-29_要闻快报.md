    Go Deep into the Grassroots and Grasp the Groups
    Leading cadres of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai are conscientiously grasping the work of the groups and have initially explored the leadership method of "one labor, two talks, three studies, four helps, and five promotions," namely: diligently participating in labor within the groups, having heart-to-heart talks with the workers, humbly learning from the group leaders and workers, helping the group backbone improve their ideological level and work ability, and summarizing and promoting the advanced work experience of the groups. Due to the all-round leap forward in the work of the groups, all aspects of the plant's work have made great progress.

    Jiangxi Province is promoting ten new technologies and new experiences for increasing production and saving building materials. These include steel wire mesh cement structures, brick thin-shell structures, mass production of slag cement, and the use of cement templates and brick templates to replace wooden templates. The promotion of these ten new technologies and new experiences has effectively accelerated the progress of key projects.
    Strive for Overproduction in Rainy Season Transportation
    The broad masses of employees in the Henan automotive transportation sector, in order to ensure increased steel production and a bumper autumn harvest, have put forward the battle cry of "No stopping in heavy rain, flying in light rain; ensure completion in rain, ensure overproduction in no rain." Although there was continuous rain in various places in the first half of July, the average vehicle-ton output of provincial automotive still reached more than 2,500 ton-kilometers.
    Vigorously Develop Maritime and River Transport
    Liaoning Province is vigorously developing maritime and river transport. Many places are making full use of the coast, rivers, canals, reservoirs, etc. to open up new waterways. At present, the number of cities and counties with navigable waterways in the province has increased from the original fourteen to twenty-five, with a total of 631 kilometers of newly opened waterways. In the first half of the year, the volume of freight completed by local shipping increased by 21% compared with the same period last year, which played a significant role in reducing the transportation burden on roads and railways.
