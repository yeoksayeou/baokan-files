    Today, this newspaper publishes news about Suzhou City's vigorous efforts to grasp the production and matching of irrigation and drainage equipment. It mentions that the workers of various factories in Suzhou City undertaking the manufacturing of irrigation and drainage equipment are determined "not to let a single part hold back the completion of equipment sets," ensuring that they grasp the production of every type of part and attach importance to the matching of every piece of irrigation and drainage equipment. This determination and spirit are very good. The production, matching, use, and repair of irrigation and drainage equipment must all be grasped well. This is precisely the measure that needs to be strongly advocated at present.
    In the current struggle against drought and flood, agriculture's most urgent need for industrial support is irrigation and drainage equipment. The more irrigation and drainage equipment there is, the greater the power of the people's communes to overcome natural disasters. According to general calculations, one horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment can irrigate 40 mu of land and can replace three and a half laborers. A 120-horsepower diesel engine equipped with an electric motor and water pump can irrigate 12,000 mu in areas with complete canal systems, which is equivalent to the area irrigated by more than 1,800 people using treadle pumps and hand-operated water pumps. Therefore, supplying more and better irrigation and drainage equipment to the countryside can not only greatly increase the strength of farmers in the fight against disasters and greatly reduce the labor intensity of farmers, but also greatly save rural labor, so that rural people's communes can use more manpower to strengthen field management and seize a bumper harvest from the struggle against natural disasters. Therefore, producing irrigation and drainage equipment has become an important task for industry to support agriculture.
    After irrigation and drainage equipment is produced, it must be delivered to farmers for use. Before it can be used, it must be assembled into complete sets. Irrigation and drainage equipment is composed of components such as power units, water pumps, water pipes, and belts, and all four major components are indispensable. And these four components are mostly manufactured separately by several units. If one unit does not complete the task on time, with quality, and in quantity, it may affect the complete supply of the entire irrigation and drainage equipment. Some machinery factories and rubber factories undertake the production tasks of some parts for irrigation and drainage equipment. The quantity and variety are not large, and some even only make one part. However, these parts must never be relegated to a secondary position or not prioritized just because of the small quantity and small output value. On the contrary, what is most urgently needed at present is these parts. Without them, irrigation and drainage equipment cannot be assembled into complete sets and cannot be transported to the front line of agricultural production. Supporting agricultural production is the responsibility of all industrial and transportation enterprises. Even if only one part is manufactured, it is necessary to ensure that it is delivered on time, with quality, and in quantity. We can also examine from the production of a single part whether we have established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and whether we attach importance to supporting agriculture. Therefore, we must all, like the workers in Suzhou City, ensure that "not a single part holds back the completion of equipment sets," and we must grasp each part one by one. If problems are found, we must take measures in a timely manner and concentrate our efforts to solve them. Only by grasping irrigation and drainage equipment in such a practical and concrete way can we be considered to truly value supporting agriculture.
    In the past few years, we have successively transferred a lot of irrigation and drainage equipment to the countryside, but it is necessary to check whether it has all been used in agricultural production. According to a recent inspection by the Shanxi Provincial Economic Commission, a total of more than 230,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment has been transferred to the countryside in the past few years, but more than 29,000 horsepower are not matched, more than 38,000 horsepower are damaged, more than 47,000 horsepower are borrowed by local industries and sideline occupations, and only more than 116,000 horsepower are directly used for agricultural production. In late June, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged meeting and specifically made a resolution on this, requiring the rapid organization of the return, matching, and repair of rural irrigation and drainage equipment and agricultural machinery. This is a very important task. In this regard, party committees in various places need to conduct serious and in-depth inspections and take effective measures. Even if the produced irrigation and drainage equipment is assembled into complete sets and transported to the countryside, can the task of supporting agriculture be considered complete? No. After irrigation and drainage equipment is transported to the countryside, it must be used, but some farmers still do not know how to use it, or are not proficient in using it. Therefore, the workers of factories and enterprises have the responsibility to organize work teams and service teams to go to the countryside to impart technology, guarantee teaching and learning, train a group of operators, and fix them down. Only in this way can irrigation and drainage equipment quickly play a role. In the process of use, some irrigation and drainage equipment may be damaged. If it is damaged, it must be repaired in time. And now the rural mechanical repair capacity is also lacking. Therefore, industrial enterprises have the responsibility to send out some technical force and equipment and take measures such as going down to the fields or transporting machines to factories to help the people's communes quickly overhaul the existing irrigation and drainage equipment. Not only should the production units of irrigation and drainage equipment do this, but some factories and enterprises with mechanical repair capabilities should also actively do this. The industrial sector's support for agriculture requires doing many specific tasks. At present, helping rural areas repair irrigation and drainage equipment and other agricultural machinery is an important specific task.
    In the movement of industry supporting agriculture, we advocate the work style of being responsible to the end and being fully responsible. In terms of irrigation and drainage equipment, production, matching, use, and repair must all be grasped. This is an urgent task for industry to support agriculture. All relevant enterprises must actively do this well.

### 抓紧排灌设备的生产、配套、使用和修理工作

    抓紧排灌设备的生产、配套、使用和修理工作
    今天本报发表的苏州市狠抓排灌设备生产配套的消息中，提到苏州市承制排灌设备的各厂职工决心“不让一个零件拖设备成套的后腿”，保证抓紧每一种零件的生产，重视每一台排灌设备的配套。这种决心和精神是很好的。排灌设备的生产、配套、使用、修理都要抓好，这正是当前需要大加提倡的措施。
    在当前抗旱防涝的斗争中，农业最迫切需要工业部门支援的，莫过于排灌设备了。排灌设备越多，人民公社战胜自然灾害的力量越大。据一般计算，一个马力的排灌设备能灌溉田地四十亩，可以代替三个半劳动力。一台一百二十马力的柴油机配上电动机和水泵，在渠道系统完整的地方，灌溉面积可达一万二千亩，相当于一千八百多人使用脚踏水车和手摇水车灌溉的面积。因此，供应农村更多更好的排灌设备，不仅可以大大增加农民抗灾斗争的力量，大大减轻农民的劳动强度，也可以大大节省农村劳动力，使农村人民公社可以用更多的人力来加强田间管理，从和自然灾害斗争中夺取丰收。因此，生产排灌设备已成为工业支援农业的一项重要任务了。
    排灌设备生产出来，要交付农民使用。在使用以前，就必须配成套。排灌设备是由动力机、水泵、水管、胶带等部件综合组成的，四大件缺一不可。而这四个组成部分，大多又是由若干个单位分别制造的，如果有一个单位没有按时、按质、按量地完成任务，就可能影响到整个排灌设备的成套供应。有些机械厂和橡胶厂担负排灌设备中某些配件的生产任务，数量和品种都不多，有的甚至只作一个零件。但是，绝不可因为这些配件、零件的数量小，产值不大，就把它放到次要的地位，或者排不上队。相反，目前最迫切需要的是这些配件、零件。没有它们排灌设备就配不成套，就不能运到农业生产的第一线去。支援农业生产是一切工业交通企业的职责，即便只承制一种零件，也要保证按时、按质、按量地交货。从一个零件的生产中也可以考查我们是不是树立了以农业为基础的思想，是不是重视了支援农业。因此，都要像苏州市职工那样，保证“不让一个零件拖设备成套的后腿”，要一个零件一个零件地抓，发现问题，就及时地采取措施，集中力量解决。只有这样切实地、具体地抓排灌设备，才算是真正重视了支援农业。
    几年来我们已经先后调运了很多排灌设备到农村，但是，是不是都用到农业生产上去了，是需要检查的。据最近山西省经济委员会的检查，几年来调运到农村的排灌设备一共二十三万多马力，但不配套的有二万九千多马力，损坏的有三万八千多马力，被地方工业和副业借去的有四万七千多马力，直接用于农业生产的只有十一万六千多马力。6月下旬山西省委扩大会议特别为此作了决议，要迅速组织归队、配套、修复农村的排灌设备和农业机械。这是十分重要的工作。对此，各地党委都需要认真深入检查和切实采取有效措施。即使生产出来的排灌设备，也配成套了，也运到农村去了，支援农业的任务是不是就算完成了呢？不是。排灌设备运到农村后要使用，而有些农民还不会使用，或者使用得还不熟练，因此工厂企业的职工就有责任组织工作队、服务队到农村去传授技术，包教包会，培训好一批操作手，并将其固定下来，这样才能使排灌设备迅速发挥作用。在使用过程中，一些排灌设备有可能损坏，坏了就要及时修理。而现在农村的机械修理能力也是缺乏的，因此工业企业又有责任抽调一些技术力量和设备，采取下到田间或运机入厂等办法，帮助人民公社迅速检修好现有的排灌设备。不仅排灌设备的生产单位应当这样做，一些有机修能力的工厂企业也应当积极这样做。工业部门支援农业是要做许多具体的工作的，当前帮助农村检修排灌设备和其他农业机械，就是一项重要的具体工作。
    在工业支援农业的运动中，我们提倡一包到底全面负责的工作作风。就排灌设备来说，生产、配套、使用、修理都要抓，这是工业支援农业的一项迫切任务，所有有关的企业，都要积极地把这件事办好。
