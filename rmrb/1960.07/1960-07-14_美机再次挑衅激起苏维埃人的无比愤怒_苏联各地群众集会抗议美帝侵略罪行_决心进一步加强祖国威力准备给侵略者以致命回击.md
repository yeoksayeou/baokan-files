Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 12th: The news that a U.S. imperialist reconnaissance plane had once again brazenly violated Soviet airspace has aroused strong anger among the broad masses of Soviet working people. Today, factories, enterprises, collective farms, and state farms across the country held mass rallies to unanimously condemn the shameless behavior of U.S. imperialism and demand that such provocative acts be resolutely stopped.

Speaking at mass rallies across the Soviet Union, working people could not contain the anger in their hearts. Strelitzov, a worker at the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Plant in Moscow, angrily said at the plant's mass rally that American generals should know that their planes that invade the Soviet Union will inevitably be mercilessly annihilated. The resolution passed by the rally stated, "We condemn the shameful provocations of the American ruling clique. We must further strengthen the power of our motherland."

Gashin, chief engineer of the Moscow First Clock Factory, said at a mass rally, "I participated in the Great Patriotic War. The U.S. imperialists should know that we have not forgotten military technology. We will not allow anyone to invade us; the fate of the aggressors will be the same as that of the German fascists."

Cannot Trust the U.S. Government

Teachers and students at Moscow University pointed out at a mass rally that the U.S. government absolutely cannot be trusted. Bebikh, a graduate student in the Chemistry Department, said at the rally, "We heard the news of the U.S. plane's renewed provocation against the Soviet Union with even greater anger. Let the U.S. imperialists know that Soviet soldiers possess the most advanced and modern technology and are skilled in using it."

The Moscow Hard Alloy Plant also held a mass rally. Steelworker Peshkov said, "We all see that Eisenhower's so-called words about stopping U.S. spy plane flights are nothing but empty talk."

U.S. "Disarmament" is All Deception

Fudoven, a designer at the Moscow Machine Tool Casting Factory, said that the fact that U.S. planes once again violated Soviet airspace shows that the so-called "disarmament" talked about by American diplomats is a complete deception of public opinion. Budaev, a lathe operator at the factory, said that those countries that provide their territory for U.S. spy planes to use should not forget that Soviet military technology can strike targets anywhere on the planet. Volkov, a foundry worker, said, "We demand that the Soviet government take resolute measures to prevent similar acts of aggression from happening again." Lobanov, a turner, said that a policy built on banditry has never had a good end; Hitler is an example of this, and all aggressors who want to rule the world should remember this well.

Absolutely Cannot Allow the U.S. to Do Whatever It Wants

The working people of Leningrad also denounced the new bandit acts of U.S. imperialism with irrepressible anger. Leonov, a worker at the Kirov Plant, said, "We must never allow the U.S. to send planes into our country as it pleases. The warmongers should know that the Soviet people will give a deserved rebuff to all those who attempt to disrupt our peaceful labor." Arakcheev, a technician at the Leningrad Hardware Factory, said after hearing about the crimes of the American aerial bandits, "The shameless provocations of the American militarists should be resolutely stopped. We demand that the Soviet government take the most forceful measures to stop American spy flights." Holomeev, a steelworker at the Iorsky Plant, said, "I can hardly express my anger in words. It seems that the tragic fate of Powers has not taught the U.S. imperialists anything. Each of us is ready to give these reckless provocateurs a fatal rebuff." Bavilavicius, a technician, said, "There is no other name for American imperialists than highway robbers." He said that Eisenhower had said that American planes would no longer fly in Soviet airspace. However, the new violation of the sacred and inviolable Soviet border by the aerial bandits shows the world that this statement is not worth a penny.

American Robbers Will Not Behave

Writer Rakovsky pointed out, "The American robbers will not behave; I cannot find appropriate words to express my anger at their evil deeds. All progressive humanity condemns the new provocative acts of U.S. imperialism."

The workers of the Transcaucasian Iron and Steel Plant in the Georgian Republic also held a mass rally. A worker who spoke at the meeting pointed out that the renewed violation of the Soviet Union by American military aircraft proves that U.S. imperialism does not want to resolve international issues through negotiation. The words of the American aggressors are not worth a penny.

Construction workers in Vilnius, the capital of the Lithuanian Republic, also held a mass rally. Technician Povilavicius said angrily, "U.S. imperialism can be regarded as blatant robbers. Eisenhower said that there would be no more spy flights. Now the whole world knows that the words of the aggressors are not worth a penny."

In Stalingrad, steelworker Gabanov of the "Red October" Steel Plant warned the British and Norwegian governments who provided their territories to the United States to carry out anti-Soviet aggression. He said: Gentlemen, do not play with fire, it will not end well for you! (Attached picture)

    美机再次挑衅激起苏维埃人的无比愤怒
　　苏联各地群众集会抗议美帝侵略罪行
　　决心进一步加强祖国威力准备给侵略者以致命回击
    新华社莫斯科12日电　美帝国主义的侦察飞机再一次无耻地侵犯苏联领空的消息，在苏联广大劳动人民中引起了强烈的愤怒。各地工厂企业、集体农庄和国营农场今天纷纷举行群众大会，一致声讨美帝国主义的无耻行为，并要求坚决制止这种挑衅行为。
    苏联各地劳动人民在群众大会上发言时都忍不住心头怒火。莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则工作母机制造厂的工人斯特雷里佐夫在这个厂的群众大会上愤怒地说，让美国将军知道，他们侵略苏联的飞机一定要被无情地歼灭。这个大会通过的决议说，我们谴责美国统治集团的可耻挑衅。我们一定要更加进一步加强我们祖国的威力。
    莫斯科第一钟表工厂的总技师加欣在群众大会上讲话时说，我参加过卫国战争。美帝国主义者应该知道，我们并没有忘记军事技术。我们不允许任何人侵犯我们，侵略者的下场将和德寇一样。
    决不能相信美国政府
    莫斯科大学的教师和学生们在群众大会上指出，绝不能相信美国政府。化学系研究生贝比赫在大会上说，我们以更加愤怒的心情听到了美国飞机再度对苏联进行挑衅的消息。让美帝国主义者知道，苏联军人拥有最完善的和最新式的技术，并且善于使用这些技术。
    莫斯科硬质合金工厂也举行了群众大会。炼钢工人佩什科夫说，我们大家都看到，艾森豪威尔所谓停止美国间谍飞机飞行的话不过是空谈。
  美国所谓“裁军”全是欺骗
    莫斯科母机铸型工厂的设计师弗道文说，美国飞机再次侵犯苏联领空的事实表明，美国外交家嘴里谈的所谓“裁军”完全是对社会舆论的欺骗。这个工厂的车工布达耶夫说，把国土提供给美国间谍飞机使用的那些国家不应忘记，苏联的军事技术是可以打击地球上任何地方的目标的。翻砂工人沃尔科夫说，我们要求苏联政府采取坚决措施，以便使类似的侵犯行为不再发生。旋工洛巴诺夫说，建筑在强盗主义基础上的政策从来没有过好下场，希特勒就是这方面的一个榜样，现在一切想统治世界的侵略者应当好好记住这一点。
  绝不能让美国为所欲为
    列宁格勒的劳动人民也以不可抑制的愤怒心情，痛斥美帝国主义者新的强盗罪行。基洛夫工厂的工人列奥诺夫说，绝不能让美国为所欲为地往我国派遣飞机。战争挑拨者应该知道，苏联人民将给予所有企图破坏我们的和平劳动的人以应有的回击。列宁格勒五金工厂的技师阿拉克切夫在听到美国空中强盗的罪行后说，应该坚决地制止美国黩武主义者的无耻挑衅行为。我们要求苏联政府采取最有力的措施，来制止美国的间谍飞行。约尔斯克工厂的炼钢工人霍洛麦耶夫说，我难以用言语来表达自己的愤怒。看来，鲍尔士悲惨的命运并没有使美帝国主义者学到什么。我们每个人都准备着给这些冒险妄为的挑衅者以致命的回击。技师巴维拉维丘斯说，除了把美国帝国主义者称作大路上的强盗之外，没有另外的称呼。他说，艾森豪威尔曾说，美国飞机不再在苏联领空飞行了。但是，空中强盗对神圣不可侵犯的苏联国境的新的侵犯向全世界表明，这个声明是一钱不值的。
  美国强盗不会老实下来
    作家拉科夫斯基指出，美国强盗们是不会老实下来的，我找不到适当的词句来表达我对他们的罪恶行径的愤怒。全体进步人类都谴责美帝国主义的新的挑衅行为。
    格鲁吉亚共和国的外高加索钢铁工厂的工人也举行了群众大会。一个工人在会上发言时指出，美国军用飞机再次侵犯苏联，这证明美帝国主义并不想用谈判的方式来解决国际问题。美国侵略者的话一钱不值
    在立陶宛共和国首都维尔纽斯的建筑工人们也举行了群众集会。技术员波维拉维楚斯愤怒地说，美帝国主义可算是明目张胆的强盗。艾森豪威尔曾说不再进行间谍飞行。现在全世界都知道，侵略者的话是一钱不值的。
    在斯大林格勒，“红十月”钢铁工厂的钢铁工人加巴诺夫在发言中警告把本国领土提供给美国实现反苏侵略行动的英国政府和挪威政府。他说：先生们，不要玩火，这对你们没有好结果！（附图片）
