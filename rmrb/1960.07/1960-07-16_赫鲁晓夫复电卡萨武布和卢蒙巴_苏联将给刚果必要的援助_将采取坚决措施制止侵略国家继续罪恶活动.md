　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: TASS Moscow, 15th: The Soviet government declared that for the victory of the just cause of Congo, it will give the Republic of Congo necessary assistance.
　　This declaration was made by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, in a reply telegram to the President of the Republic of Congo, Kasavubu, and the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Congo, Lumumba.
　　Kasavubu and Lumumba sent a telegram to Khrushchev on July 14th, stating that the national territory of Congo was occupied by Belgian troops, and the lives of the President and Prime Minister of the Republic were in danger. They pointed out that if the Western bloc does not stop its aggression against the sovereignty of the Republic of Congo, they may have to request the intervention of the Soviet Union.
　　In the telegram, Khrushchev emphasized the great international significance of the Congolese people's heroic struggle for the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Congo, which had been a victim of imperialist aggression. The imperialist armed intervention in the Republic of Congo is an attempt to stop the process of complete liberation of Africa, and if possible, to make it retreat.
　　Khrushchev pointed out that the United Nations Security Council did a good thing by demanding that the Belgian government withdraw Belgian troops from Congolese territory.
　　Despite such a resolution, if the aggression continues, the Soviet government declares that it is necessary to take more effective measures in accordance with the guidelines of the United Nations and the guidelines of peace-loving countries that sympathize with the Congolese cause.
　　Khrushchev's telegram stated that if the countries directly carrying out imperialist aggression against the Republic of Congo, and the countries promoting such aggression, continue their criminal activities, the Soviet Union will take resolute measures to stop the aggression.
　　Khrushchev said that the Soviet government's starting point is that aggression against Congo is not merely a local conflict, but that the issue of stopping such aggression is of great significance to the whole world. The Congo issue is a matter for all of civilized humanity.

　　赫鲁晓夫复电卡萨武布和卢蒙巴
　　苏联将给刚果必要的援助
　　将采取坚决措施制止侵略国家继续罪恶活动
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日电：苏联政府声明，为了刚果正义事业的胜利，它将给予刚果共和国必要的援助。
    这一声明是苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给刚果共和国总统卡萨武布和刚果总理兼国防部长卢蒙巴的复电中发表的。
    卡萨武布和卢蒙巴在7月14日打电报给赫鲁晓夫，电报中说，刚果国家领土被比利时军队所占领，共和国总统和总理的生命受到危险。他们指出，如果西方阵营不停止对刚果共和国主权的侵略，他们可能将不得不请求苏联的干涉。
    赫鲁晓夫在电报中强调指出了刚果人民为争取曾作为帝国主义侵略牺牲品的刚果共和国的独立和领土完整而英勇斗争的重大国际意义。帝国主义对刚果共和国的武装干涉，是企图阻止非洲的彻底解放的进程，如果可能，并企图使它向后退。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，联合国安全理事会做了一件好事，它要求比利时政府从刚果领土上撤走比利时军队。
    尽管作出了这样的决议，如果侵略还继续下去的话，那末，苏联政府宣布，有必要根据联合国的方针和同情刚果事业的爱好和平国家的方针，采取更有效的措施。
    赫鲁晓夫的电报中说，如果直接对刚果共和国进行帝国主义侵略的国家和推动这种侵略的国家，继续它们的罪恶活动，那末，苏联将采取坚决措施制止侵略。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府考虑的出发点是：对刚果的侵略不单是局部冲突，而且制止这种侵略的问题对全世界都有重大意义。刚果的事情是整个文明人类的事情。
