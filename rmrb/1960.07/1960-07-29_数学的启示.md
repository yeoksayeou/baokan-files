    Mathematical Inspiration
    Jiang Hui
    A mathematics worker from Shandong Province, deeply involved in the production front, has made great strides in linear programming and operations research, saving the country a significant amount of manpower, materials, and financial resources. This is a great achievement.
    The attainment of this achievement gives people a profound inspiration: that is, we must delve into practical production in order to better serve production. Take the teachers and students of Qufu Normal College as an example. When they first stepped onto the production front, they had no idea what problems existed in production and how to use linear programming to serve practical production. However, they listened to the Party, earnestly went deep into the production site, personally pulled handcarts, assisted truck drivers, and worked as receivers and dispatchers in freight yards. They first became students of the workers and became one with them, and finally gradually discovered the various problems existing in practical production and found ways for linear programming to serve practical production.
    However, relying solely on the strength of teachers and students is still relatively weak, and this cannot fully exert the role of linear programming in production. We must hand over the mathematical tool of linear programming, and even operations research, to the vast numbers of workers and peasants. Facts have proven that workers and peasants, with their rich practical experience in production, are fully capable of quickly understanding many modern mathematical knowledge, and they can also creatively apply this knowledge in conjunction with their own production experience. Once the workers and peasants have mastered the knowledge of operations research, it is like a steed with wings, immediately having a huge impact on production. In this way, operations research is not only used in transportation, but also developed to factories and enterprises, water conservancy construction sites, people's communes, and even blooms everywhere. The path becomes wider and wider, the team gathers larger and larger, and the world becomes wider and wider. It is truly "the sea is wide for fish to leap, the sky is high for birds to fly," and the role of operations research in production becomes more and more significant.
    The widespread application of linear programming and operations research to serve practical production will inevitably promote the development of operations research itself. The Great Leap Forward and the people's commune system, the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement, have opened up a broad world for operations research research and provided extremely rich research materials. Practical production constantly raises many brand-new mathematical problems, which often prompt our mathematical workers to establish and create new mathematical theories and methods. "Go deep into practical production, serve production," this direction is undoubtedly very correct, and this principle seems to be easily understood by people. However, when people move in this direction, things will not be as simple as we expected, and we will encounter one difficulty after another, there will be twists and turns, and even struggles. However, as long as we persevere, we will overcome one difficulty after another, resolve one contradiction after another, and reach a new state. This principle has realistic significance for the development of operations research, and what inspiration does it not have for other natural science departments?

    数学的启示
    江辉
    山东省数学工作者，深入生产前线，大搞线性规划，大搞运筹学，为国家节约了大量的人力、物力和财力，这是一个很大的成就。
    这个成就的得来，给人一个深刻的启示，这就是必须深入生产实际，才能更好地为生产服务。以曲阜师范学院的师生们为例，当他们刚踏上生产前线的时候，对生产中究竟有些什么问题，怎样运用线性规划为生产实际服务，茫无头绪。但是，他们听党的话，踏踏实实地深入到生产现场中去，亲自拉地排车，当汽车司机的助手，到货场当收货员、发货员，先做工人的学生，同工人打成了一片，终于逐渐发现了生产实际存在的这样那样的问题，找到了线性规划为生产实际服务的门路。
    可是，仅仅依靠师生们的力量，还是比较单薄的，这还不能充分发挥线性规划对生产的作用。必须把线性规划以至运筹学这个数学工具，交给广大工人和农民。事实证明，工人农民由于有着丰富的生产实践经验，他们完全能够很快地理解许多现代数学知识，而且还能够结合自己的生产经验，创造性地运用这些知识。当工农群众一旦掌握了运筹学这门知识，便如骏马添了双翼，立即在生产中发生巨大的影响。这样一来，运筹学不仅用于交通运输，而且发展到工厂企业、水利工地、人民公社，以至遍地开花，路子越走越宽，队伍越聚越大，天地越来越广，真是“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”，运筹学在生产中发挥的作用也就越来越显著。
    广泛地运用线性规划和运筹学，为生产实际服务，必然会促使运筹学本身的发展。大跃进和人民公社化，全国规模的技术革新和技术革命运动，为运筹学的研究开辟了广阔的天地，提供了极其丰富的研究资料。生产实际中不断提出许多崭新的数学问题，常常会促使我们数学工作者去建立和创造数学的新理论和新方法。“深入生产实际，为生产服务”，这个方向无疑是十分正确的，这个道理看来也是容易为人们所理解的。但是，当人们朝着这个方向前进的时候，事情却又不会像我们预想的那样简单，还会碰到一个一个难关，会有曲折，甚至有斗争。但是，只要坚持下去，就会跨过一个一个难关，解决一个一个矛盾，达到一个新的境地。这个道理，对于运筹学的发展有着现实的意义，对于其他自然科学部门，又何尝没有启示呢？
