Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Tokyo News: The 220,000 postal workers belonging to the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union held workplace rallies simultaneously in 12,000 locations nationwide this morning, strongly protesting the Kishida Nobusuke government's postal ministry's illegal suppression of workers participating in the patriotic struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    The Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications announced a list on July 6th of 12,408 workers who have been "punished."

    The headquarters of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union issued a statement pointing out that the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, in order to safeguard peace and democracy, has risen up with the people to carry out the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and feels hatred and anger towards the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression.

    In Tokyo, workers at the Central Post Office held a half-hour protest rally in front of the post office building starting at 8:30 in the morning.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution strongly protesting the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' illegal punishment of workers. The resolution stated: In order to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that endangers peace, we have launched a struggle with the support of the broad masses of the people. Our struggle is a legitimate exercise of the people's rights.

    The resolution stated: It is not the workers who should be punished, but Kishida Nobusuke, who forcibly "passed" the new "Security Treaty."

    The resolution firmly stated that postal workers will fight to the end to crush the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    At the meeting, the chairman of the Central Post Office Union branch and the head of the youth department, who were "punished," spoke successively, expressing their firm will to fight to the end to crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and illegal suppression, and to safeguard democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Tokyo News: The Standing Committee of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today to strengthen the struggle to protest the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression of the anti-American, anti-Kishida patriotic movement.

    According to Kyodo News, the Kishida Nobusuke government is stepping up preparations to persecute patriots who participated in demonstrations, general strikes, and the encirclement of U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty events against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has prepared arrest warrants for eighty people.

    The Standing Committee meeting decided to launch a movement to raise 10 million yen as a fighting fund against suppression.

    The Standing Committee meeting also decided to hold a discussion with farmer representatives from various regions who came to Tokyo to attend the meeting to study the experiences and lessons of farmers in carrying out the movement against the new "Security Treaty."

    The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today strongly protesting the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The statement pointed out: "The government and police authorities are attempting to continue to suppress workers' united actions against the new 'Security Treaty.' This approach is a provocation against the people and is absolutely intolerable."

    Socialist Party Secretary-General Eda Saburo, National Movement Committee Chairman Tanaka Toshio, and Diet Policy Committee Chairman Yamamoto Koichi visited Kishida Nobusuke's Chief Cabinet Secretary Shiina Etsusaburo and Deputy Prime Minister Masutani Hideji, as well as officials in charge of the National Police Agency, to protest the suppression of participants in the movement against the new "Security Treaty."

    Organizations throughout Japan opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" have decided to give a powerful counterattack to the Kishida Nobusuke government's illegal suppression. Protest rallies will be held in Sapporo, Iwaguchi, and other places on the 9th and 10th, respectively.
