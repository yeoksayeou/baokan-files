    Grasp Tightly the Steel Knife of Revenge
    Kazakh Kurban Ali
    For many years, the people of the Congo have been prisoners in their own land, suffering persecution and humiliation from the imperialists—this gang of robbers. Your people have realized, and have seen, that a single spark can start a prairie fire—the time for battle, to destroy the invisible iron prison, has concentrated your wisdom and perseverance. Your brave and resolute people, to destroy that invisible iron prison, have stepped onto the front line of battle, grasping tightly the steel knife of revenge. Grasp tightly your steel knife, let it emit a shimmering light, do not listen to the fallacies of conciliation, if the enemy is not destroyed, the steel knife cannot be sheathed and hung on the wall. Victory will surely belong to you, you have strength, the people are the decisive factor for victory. The enemy is falling into a state of destruction day by day, like a decaying tree about to fall. Grasp tightly your fighting steel knife, point it at the enemy, and rush to the battlefield! Empty words cannot replace independence and freedom, it can only be seized through battle!

    握紧复仇的钢刀
    哈萨克族　库尔班阿里多少年来，刚果的人民在自己的土地上竟成了囚徒，遭受了帝国主义——这群强盗的迫害和侮辱。你的人民意识到，也已看到，星火燎原——这战斗的时机，为摧毁无形的铁牢，集中了自己的智慧和毅力。你那英勇果敢的人民，为摧毁那无形的铁牢，走上了战斗的火线，握紧了复仇的钢刀。握紧你的那把钢刀，让它发射闪烁的光亮，别听信那调和的谬论，敌人不灭，钢刀不能入鞘上墙。胜利一定属于你，你有的是力
  量，人民就是决定胜利的因素。敌人一天天陷入毁灭的境地，像一棵快要败倒的朽树。握紧你那战斗的钢刀，指向敌人，奔向战场吧！空话替代不了独立和自由，只能用战斗来夺取它！
