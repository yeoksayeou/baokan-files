Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, Tokyo dispatch: According to statistics from the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, 12.5 million people in Japan have successively participated in the ten-thousand-mile peace march against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament.

Kyodo News Agency said today that the peace march "demonstrates an unprecedented surge of emotion."

This peace march was initiated by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on April 24th of this year. From Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa Island in the south, people from all over Japan traveled over mountains and rivers, taking turns, forming many large marching armies. All the armies are heading towards their destination – Tokyo, where they will finally converge to participate in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled to be held in Tokyo starting on August 2nd.

The entire journey of the march is 10,000 kilometers. Along the way, the marching teams became propaganda teams, appealing to people from all walks of life against the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for maintaining world peace. In many places, the people held welcoming rallies for the marchers and passed resolutions against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," against nuclear armament, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and demanding disarmament. According to the plan, the marching teams will specifically pass through 214 U.S. military bases and Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" military bases, calling on residents around the bases to fight against the military bases. The Japanese peace march is a magnificent undertaking by the Japanese people to strive for peace and independence, and it has received enthusiastic support from people from all walks of life in Japan.

Currently, the marching teams are continuing to advance towards Tokyo.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Tokyo dispatch: The ten-thousand-kilometer peace march by the Japanese people against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament continues to advance towards Tokyo. The southern route team arrived in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, on the 4th.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's official newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today, calling on all JCP members to propagate and implement the decisions of the Eleventh Central Committee Plenary Session among the broad masses of the people.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the JCP Central Committee recently passed the report made by the cadre meeting on the development of the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the work of building the party in the current people's struggle, as well as the appeal entitled "Let Us Unite and Advance Under the Banner of Patriotism and Justice."

The appeal calls on the Japanese people to strengthen the joint struggle organizations established to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" and develop them into permanent organizations as the foundation of a united front; to unite all forces opposing Nobusuke Kishi to victoriously establish a caretaker government; and in the upcoming general election, all democratic and patriotic forces should unite.

"Akahata" emphasized that Party members should widely propagate this appeal among the people. The editorial pointed out that while the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet is still eking out a precarious existence, we must strengthen the movement to protest repression and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet. At the same time, in order to defend and develop the united front of democratic forces, it is necessary to further struggle to win the support of a broader mass of people.

    日本一千二百多万人参加了和平大游行
    “赤旗报”号召党员在人民中宣传贯彻十一中全会的决定
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：据日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的统计，日本已经有一千二百五十万人陆续参加了反对日美“安全条约”、要求禁止核武器和裁军的万里和平大游行。
    共同社今天说，和平大游行“表现了空前未有的高涨情绪”。
    这次和平大游行是在日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会发起下从今年4月24日开始的。北自北海道，南至冲绳岛，日本各地人民跋山涉水，相互接替，形成许多路游行大军。各路大军一齐向目的地——东京进发，最后将汇合到那里，参加预定从8月2日起在东京召开的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会。
    大游行的全程共达一万公里。途中，游行队伍变成了宣传队，他们每到一处，都向各界人民呼吁反对侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，维护世界和平。许多地方的人民为游行者举行了欢迎大会，并通过了反对新日美“安全条约”、反对核武装、要求岸信介内阁下台、要求实现裁军的决议。根据计划，游行队伍将特别经过二百一十四个美军基地和日本“自卫队”的军事基地，呼吁基地周围的居民为反对军事基地而斗争。日本和平大游行是日本人民争取和平和独立的一个壮举，它受到日本各界人民的热烈支持。
    现在，各路游行队伍正在继续向东京前进。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”、要求禁止核武器和裁军的一万公里和平大游行的队伍继续向东京进发。南路队伍4日到达滋贺县大津市。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日共全体党员在广大人民中宣传和贯彻第十一次中央委员会全体会议的决定。
    日共十一中全会最近通过了干部会所作的关于日本人民反对日美“安全条约”斗争的发展情况以及在目前人民的斗争中开展建党工作的报告和题为“让我们团结起来，在爱国主义和正义的旗帜下前进”的呼吁书。
    呼吁书号召日本人民加强为反对修改“安全条约”而成立的共同斗争组织，并把它们发展为永久性组织，以作为统一战线的基础；团结一切反对岸信介的力量胜利地建立看守政府；在即将举行的大选中，一切民主和爱国力量应该团结起来。
    “赤旗报”强调党员应该在人民中间广泛宣传这个呼吁书。社论指出，在岸信介内阁仍然苟延残喘的时候，我们必须加强展开抗议镇压和打倒岸信介内阁的运动。同时，为了保卫和发展民主力量的统一战线，必须进一步为争取更广泛的群众的支持而斗争。
