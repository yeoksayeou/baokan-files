Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, New Delhi News: On the 14th, government employees in various parts of India continued to persist in their strike, and received support from sympathy strikes held by workers in various regions. At the same time, the Indian government intensified its suppression and sabotage of the strike. According to the Press Trust of India, as of the evening of the 14th, the government had arrested approximately five thousand people, with one state, Kerala, accounting for one thousand of the arrests.

According to Reuters, the president of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Mirajkar, was arrested by the Indian government on the morning of the 14th. In Madras, fifteen communist-led trade union leaders were also arrested.

According to an announcement by the official Indian News Service, in the eastern region of India alone, the government has so far dismissed or fired approximately three thousand eight hundred government employees.

The Indian News Agency pointed out that on the 14th, workers in various parts of India held day-long sympathy strikes, which were successful in major central cities. According to today's "Times of India," workers in 57 textile factories in Coimbatore, Madras State, one of India's textile centers, also held a one-day strike on the 14th.

Many reports also say that attendance at central government offices in Orissa and Bihar dropped to the lowest point since the strike began on the 14th; about five hundred employees of the National Accounting Office and the Central Tax Department in the capital Delhi also joined the strike on this day.

According to the Press Trust of India, on the 14th, all vehicular traffic in Calcutta, India's largest city, and its suburbs was paralyzed from early morning. Stores and markets along the road were closed, and the streets were desolate. Due to traffic disruptions, many staff members of hotels, water plants, power supply stations, newspapers, and news agencies did not go to work. The "Statesman" reported that students did not attend school on this day. Other reports said that many banks and other institutions in Calcutta were also closed on the 14th. Mail and telegrams were not delivered. In Burnpur, a steel city 300 kilometers from Calcutta, production began to decline sharply due to the lack of raw material transportation, and if the situation continues, the blast furnaces in this area will have to stop production.

According to the Press Trust of India, the Bombay docks were also completely paralyzed on the 14th, and many mechanical and chemical manufacturing industries in Bombay also stopped work on this day. Due to the impact of the strike, postal authorities had to rely on "volunteers" recruited by the government to deliver mail and telegrams.

Reuters reported that with 18,000 dockworkers joining the strike in support of government employees, the eight-mile-long waterfront of Bombay was deserted, and cranes, tugs, and dredgers were idle. Vehicles loaded with armed police patrolled the city's main industrial areas, and sentries guarded intersections and some businesses.

According to the "Times of India," the government arrested 382 people in Bombay alone on the 14th.

　　印度政府雇员坚持罢工
　　加尔各答交通停顿　孟买码头全部瘫痪
　　政府加紧镇压　全国被捕者已近五千人
    新华社15日讯　新德里消息：14日印度各地政府雇员继续坚持罢工，并且得到各地工人举行的同情罢工的支持。同时印度政府也加紧镇压和破坏罢工。据印度报业托辣斯报道，截至14日晚上为止，政府已经逮捕了约五千人，其中喀拉拉邦一个邦的被捕人数就达一千人。
    据路透社报道，全印工会大会主席密拉志卡尔已经在14日早晨被印度政府逮捕。在马德拉斯，也有十五名共产党领导的工会领袖被捕。
    据官方的印度新闻处宣布，仅在印度东部地区，政府至今已经开除或解雇了大约三千八百名政府雇员。
    印度新闻社指出，14日印度各地工人举行为时一天的同情罢工，在主要的中心城市取得了成功。据今天的“印度时报”报道，印度纺织业中心之一——马德拉斯邦的科因巴托尔地方的五十七家纺织厂工人，也在14日举行了一天罢工。
    许多消息还说，在奥里萨邦和比哈尔邦的中央政府办事处的出勤人数在14日已下降到罢工以来的最低点；首都德里的全国会计主任办公室和中央税务部门约五百名雇员也在这天起参加罢工。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，14日那天，印度第一大城市加尔各答市和郊区的所有车辆交通从清晨起就陷于停顿。路旁的商店和市集都关了门，街道上一片荒凉。由于交通受阻，旅馆、自来水厂、电力供应站以及报馆和通讯社等部门的很多工作人员都没有上班。“政治家报”说，学生在这一天也没有上学。另外的消息说，加尔各答许多银行和其他机关在14日也都关了门。邮件和电报没有投递。在离加尔各答三百公里的布恩浦尔钢铁城由于没有人运送原料，生产开始直线下降，如果情况继续下去，这个地方的高炉将不得不停止生产。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，孟买码头在14日也全部瘫痪，孟买不少机械和化学制造工业也在这天停工。由于罢工影响，邮政当局只好依靠政府召募的“志愿人员”来投递邮件和电报。
    路透社报道说，由于一万八千名码头工人参加了支持政府雇员的罢工，孟买八英里长的江边空无一人，起重机、拖轮和挖泥机陷于停顿。装载着武装警察的车辆在这个城市的主要工业区来往巡逻，哨兵守卫在交叉路口和一些企业附近。
    据“印度时报”报道，14日这一天，政府在孟买一地就逮捕了三百八十二人。
