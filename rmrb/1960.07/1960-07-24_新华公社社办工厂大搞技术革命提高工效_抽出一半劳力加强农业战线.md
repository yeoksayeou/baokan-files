Xinhua Commune's Factory Launches Technical Revolution to Improve Efficiency
Draws Out Half its Labor Force to Strengthen the Agricultural Front

(According to Xinhua Daily) The industrial workers of the Xinhua People's Commune in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, rationally adjusted labor organization, and drew out 50% of the labor force, a total of 314 people, to participate in agricultural production. Now, the transferred personnel have been投入into the battle of fertilizing and weeding cotton fields and have achieved results. The remaining factory workers worked hard to produce, and exceeded the production plan in early July.

Not long ago, the Xinhua People's Commune Party Committee, in order to further implement the fundamental policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, decided to squeeze out labor from the commune-run industry to strengthen the agricultural front. This decision was supported by more than 600 cadres and commune members in the commune-run industry. However, some cadres advocated "equal treatment" and were unwilling to transfer people to support agriculture. In response to this situation, the Party Committee launched a forum and debate among the cadres and workers in the commune-run industry, discussing the following questions: 1. Why should agriculture be the foundation? 2. What is the relationship between agriculture and the commune-run industry? During the discussion, everyone used many facts to illustrate the principle that agriculture is the foundation. Yu Peiying, a female worker from the commune-run sewing factory, said: "Agriculture is the lifeblood. What we eat, wear, and use all comes from agriculture. With the great development of agriculture, the country will be rich and the people will be strong, and industrial production will have more raw materials and markets to achieve greater leaps forward." Through the debate, everyone further clarified that the commune-run industry must better serve agriculture, which will not only promote the development of agriculture but also enable the commune-run industry to achieve greater development.

On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, the industrial units run by the commune launched a technical revolution movement, vigorously reformed tools and equipment, and stories of "one person doing the work of several, and efficiency multiplied several times" continued to emerge. In the degumming workshop of the hemp spinning factory, hemp was originally hammered with mallets. After the technical revolution, semi-automatic hammering machines were used, and efficiency increased fivefold. The commune livestock farm originally had more than 60 workers, but after the technical revolution, 27 people were freed up. On the basis of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, the commune Party Committee comprehensively reviewed the labor force of industrial and sideline units, and adjusted the labor organization of each unit in a timely manner according to the degree of importance and urgency, thereby extracting 314 laborers to support agriculture. Because the transfer of labor was carried out on the basis of carrying out the technical revolution movement, the production of each industrial and sideline unit was still able to proceed normally.

Now, the 314 workers who have been drawn out to support agriculture have been led by leading comrades from various units to settle down in agricultural production teams. More than 30 workers from the hemp spinning factory are working with farmers in the production team to prevent and control cotton field pests and remove weeds. After some units' workers participated in agricultural production, they accumulated more than 1,100 loads of fertilizer for the production team in one day, and promptly top-dressed more than ten acres of rice fields lacking fertilizer. All of this has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the members of the agricultural production team, and their confidence in striving for a bumper autumn harvest is even greater.

    新华公社社办工厂大搞技术革命提高工效
    抽出一半劳力加强农业战线
    据新华日报消息　江苏省南通县新华人民公社社办工业职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，合理调整劳动组织，抽出了50％的劳动力、共三百一十四人参加农业生产。现在，调出的人员已投入了棉田施肥锄草的战斗，取得了成绩；留厂职工努力生产，7月上旬超额完成了生产计划。
    不久前，新华人民公社党委为了进一步贯彻以农业为基础的根本方针，决定在社办工业中挤出劳动力加强农业战线。这一决定受到了全社社办工业中六百多个干部和社员的拥护。但是，有的干部却主张“平等对待”，不愿意调人支援农业。针对这一情况，党委就在社办工业的干部职工中发动鸣放辩论，讨论问题是：一、为什么要以农业为基础？二、农业和社办工业的关系怎么样？在讨论中，大家用许多事实说明农业是基础的道理。社办缝纫厂的女工于沛英说：“农业是命根子，我们吃的、穿的、用的，都来自农业，农业大发展，国就富、民就强，工业生产也才会有更多的原料和市场，实现更大的跃进。”通过辩论，使大家进一步明确了社办工业必须更好地为农业服务，这样，既会促进农业的发展，也会使社办工业得到更大的发展。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，社办工业各单位深入开展了技术革命运动，大搞工具设备的改革，“一人顶几人，工效翻几番”的事迹不断涌现。麻纺厂脱胶车间原来是用鎯头锤打麻的，经过技术革命，改用半自动化的锤击机以后，工效提高了五倍。公社畜牧场原来有六十多个职工，经过技术革命，腾出了二十七人。在大搞技术革命的基础上，公社党委对工业、副业单位的劳动力进行全面排队，根据轻重缓急，及时调整各个单位的劳动组织，从而抽出了三百十四个劳力支援农业。由于抽调劳动力是在开展技术革命运动的基础上进行的，各工业、副业单位生产仍然能够正常进行。
    现在，被抽调出来支援农业的三百十四个职工已经由各单位领导同志带领前往农业生产队落户。麻纺厂三十多个职工在生产队和农民一起防治棉田虫害，清除杂草。有的单位的职工参加农业生产后，在一天内就为生产队积肥一千一百多担，使十多亩缺肥的稻田及时追了肥。这些，都大大鼓舞了农业生产队队员的干劲，他们对争取秋熟大丰收的信心也就更足了。
