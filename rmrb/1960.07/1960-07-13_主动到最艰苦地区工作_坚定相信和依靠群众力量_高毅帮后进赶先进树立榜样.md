　　Xi'an, July 12th (From our newspaper) Communist Party member Gao Yi voluntarily requested to work in the most difficult area – Gaojiagua Production Team of Gaojie Village Commune in Suide County, Shaanxi Province. His communist style of tackling difficulties head-on and his mass-line work style of going deep among the masses have had a tremendous impact throughout Shaanxi Province. Currently, a movement is underway among cadres throughout the province to learn from Gao Yi's style and go deep into the most difficult, arduous, and weakly led areas to work.

　　Under the long-term education and cultivation of the Party organization, Gao Yi has inherited the communist style of tackling difficulties head-on and the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly in his work as a village clerk, district clerk, district party secretary, and county supervisory committee secretary for more than ten years. Last spring, while working in the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the CCP, he was assigned to assist the Gaojiagua Production Team. He found that although production had been increasing year by year, the pace of progress was not significant due to the remote location and inconvenient transportation of the mountainous area. He deeply felt the importance of strengthening the work in backward areas. After returning to the prefectural committee, he applied to the Party organization to work in the Gaojiagua Production Team for a long time and expressed his determination: he would not return until the appearance of the area was changed.

　　On November 9th last year, Gao Yi arrived at the Gaojiagua Production Team. The next morning, he went around the village with a manure basket to collect manure. Afterwards, he always went up the mountain at the crack of dawn and returned when it was dark, working alongside the commune members. He always took the lead in labor, seeking out heavy and arduous tasks. Once, the commune assigned the production team the task of digging seventy weir pits. At that time, the ground was frozen as hard as iron, and it was very difficult. He took the lead in carrying a hoe up the mountain, which motivated all the team members to go up the mountain, and they dug one hundred and twenty weir pits in just two days. From last year to the present, excluding going out to attend meetings, he has averaged thirty-three workdays per month.

　　Because Gao Yi always stood at the forefront of production, shared weal and woe with the masses, cared about the masses in every way, and consulted with the masses in everything, he quickly became a confidant of the cadres and commune members. The masses and cadres told him everything, so in a very short time, he found the key problems in changing the backward situation, and together with everyone, he worked out specific methods and made plans. This further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members. Last winter and this spring, they first launched a high tide of farmland capital construction, digging thirty-seven wells, building twenty-three silt dams, and repairing two hundred mu of terraced water canals, managing a total of nine mountains, which was more than what had been done in the previous three years. Since then, the production team has leaped from backward to advanced and has been rated as a red flag team. Subsequently, the entire commune launched a movement to learn from Gaojiagua and catch up with Gaojiagua.

　　Gao Yi firmly believed in the revolutionary drive and infinite wisdom of the masses. The key is to strengthen the Party's leadership and boldly mobilize the masses. Therefore, after he arrived at the production team, he regarded enlightening the communist consciousness of the Party members and helping the branch establish a leading core as the central link in improving the work. Under his leadership, the branch established a night Party school, organized Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to study Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," established the lofty ambition to change the face of the mountainous area, and promoted the communist style of tackling difficulties head-on and giving way to honors. At the same time, he relied on local cadres in everything and discussed work methods with them and improved their style, which quickly improved the awareness of Party and League members and the work ability of cadres, uniting all the commune members around the Party, forming a force, and making all kinds of work flourish.

　　Under the influence of Gao Yi's style, twelve outstanding cadres of Gaojie Village Commune first went to work in backward production teams. Currently, ten teams have become advanced production teams. In Yulin Prefecture, more than 710 cadres have also taken Gao Yi as an example and gone deep into backward production teams to work. In Guanzhong, in the Qinling and Bashan areas, a movement to learn from Gao Yi has also been launched.

### 主动到最艰苦地区工作　坚定相信和依靠群众力量　高毅帮后进赶先进树立榜样

　　主动到最艰苦地区工作　坚定相信和依靠群众力量
　　高毅帮后进赶先进树立榜样
    本报西安12日电　共产党员高毅自动请求到最艰苦的地区——陕西省绥德县高杰村公社高家坬生产队去工作，他的这种见困难就上的共产主义风格和深入群众的群众路线的工作作风，在陕西全省发生了巨大的影响。目前，全省干部中正掀起一个学习高毅这种风格，纷纷深入到最困难、最艰苦和领导薄弱的地区去工作的运动。
    高毅在党组织的长期教育和培养下，十多年来，在担任乡文书、区文书、区委书记、县监委会书记等工作中，都继承了见困难就上的共产主义风格和处处为人民服务的精神。去年春季，他在中共榆林地委工作的时候，被派到高家坬生产队帮助工作，他发现这里生产虽然年年上升，但由于山区地方偏僻，交通不便，工作跃进步伐不大，深深感到加强后进地区的工作的重要。他回到地委后，就向党组织提出了到高家坬生产队去长期工作的申请，并表示了决心：不改变那里的面貌就不回来。
    去年11月9日，高毅到了高家坬生产队。第二天早晨，他就提着粪筐满村去拾粪。以后，他每天总是天一闪亮就上山，天黑回来，和社员们一块劳动。在劳动中他总是带头干，找重活、苦活干。有一次，公社分配下这个生产队打七十个堰窝的任务，当时，地冻如铁，困难很大，他就首先扛上镢头上山，带动了全队社员都上山去，只两天就打了一百二十个堰窝。从去年到现在，他除外出开会，平均每月作三十三个劳动日。
    由于高毅始终站在生产最前线，和群众共甘苦，处处关心群众，事事和群众商量，很快就成为干部、社员们的知心人。群众、干部对他无话不说，因而在很短的时间内，他就找到了改变后进面貌的关键问题，并和大家共同研究出了具体的办法，作出了规划。这样，就更加鼓舞了社员的革命劲头。去冬今春，首先掀起了一个农田基本建设高潮，打井三十七眼，打淤地坝二十三处，修水渠梯田二百亩，共治理了九架山，比以往三年做的还多。从此，这个生产队就由后进一跃而为先进，被评为红旗队。接着，全公社就掀起了学高家坬、赶高家坬的运动。
    高毅坚定地相信群众的革命干劲和无穷智慧。关键是加强党的领导，放手发动群众。因此，他到这个生产队以后，就把启发党员的共产主义觉悟，帮助支部树立领导核心作为改进工作的中心环节。在他的领导下，支部成立了夜党校，组织党员、团员学习毛主席“愚公移山”等著作，树立改变山区面貌的雄心大志，发扬见困难就上、见荣誉就让的共产主义风格。同时，他处处依靠当地干部，和他们研究工作方法，改进作风，这样就迅速提高了党团员的觉悟和干部的工作能力，把全体社员团结在党的周围，形成了一股劲，各项工作蓬蓬勃勃。
    在高毅这种风格的影响下，高杰村公社十二个优秀干部首先到后进生产队去工作，目前已有十个队变成了先进生产队。榆林全专区先后有七百一十多干部也以高毅为榜样，深入到后进生产队去工作。在关中，在秦岭和巴山地区，也都掀起了学习高毅的运动。
