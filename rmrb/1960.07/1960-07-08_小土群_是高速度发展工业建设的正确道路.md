"Small Indigenous Groups" are the Correct Path for High-Speed Industrial Development
Qin Yingji, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the industrial construction of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, through the joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the region and the enthusiastic support of fraternal provinces (regions) and cities across the country, is developing at an unprecedented speed. The entire industrial landscape has undergone profound changes. The region has gradually established a number of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" covering various industries such as metallurgy, machinery, coal, electricity, light industry, and chemical industry, from scratch, from small to large, and from indigenous to foreign; and has also established some modern large-scale industrial enterprises. Taking the steel industry as an example, Guangxi did not produce even an ounce of steel during the more than twenty years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. Although some indigenous iron could be produced, the output was very small. After the mass movement of vigorously developing steel in 1958, we not only smelted steel, ending Guangxi's history of not producing steel, but also rolled the smelted steel into steel products. The output of pig iron in the past two years is three times that of the hundred years before liberation; batches of steel "small indigenous groups" have transitioned to "small foreign groups." And on this basis, iron and steel complexes with modern scale, such as Liuzhou and Guixian, are being built. In the coal industry, the region's raw coal output in 1959 increased by about fifty times compared with ten years ago. In addition to the large-scale expansion of the original Heshan and Xæ¹¾ coal mines, new coal mines with a certain scale and mechanical equipment such as Dongluo, Tunli, Yangliu, Daqing, and Luocheng have also been built; each special district has also built a number of small coal kilns. In terms of the machinery industry, on the eve of liberation, the entire region only had the Liuzhou Agricultural Machinery Company, which had about two hundred workers and less than thirty machine tools. Before liberation, this company could only produce some simple agricultural tools. By the end of 1959, the number of machinery factories with more than 300 people in the region had increased to more than forty; and each county had established a machinery factory. Diesel engines, electric motors, water pumps, transformers, air compressors, tractors, etc., which could not be produced in the past, can now be produced; and the task of producing complete sets of equipment, which could not be undertaken in the past, can now be started. With the rapid development of heavy industries such as steel, coal, electricity, and machinery, other industrial construction has also made great leaps forward. The comprehensive leap forward in industrial construction in the past two years has not only played a huge role in supporting agricultural production and meeting the needs of people's lives but also cultivated a strong contingent of workers of all ethnic groups in the region. At present, the number of employees in industrial and transportation enterprises in the region has increased by eighteen times compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of technicians has increased by twenty-four times compared with the early days of liberation. This has laid a good foundation for further expanding Guangxi's industrial construction in the future.

The speed of Guangxi's industrial development in the past two years has been unprecedented in history. This speed was not only impossible before liberation but also an unprecedented achievement even after liberation. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the speed of industrial construction development in Guangxi can be said to be quite fast, but the development speed in the past two years has far exceeded the First Five-Year Plan period. The growth rate of the region's total industrial output value in 1958 and 1959 was equivalent to 3.1 times and 2.6 times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period, respectively. The main reason why Guangxi's industrial construction has been able to achieve such a high development speed in the past two years is that we have implemented the general line for socialist construction proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs." It is precisely because we resolutely implemented the policy of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises as the main focus; and simultaneously developing foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and advanced along the road of vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" that we were able to achieve a high speed of leap forward in industrial construction.

However, in the process of vigorously developing Guangxi's industrial construction at a high speed along the road of vigorously developing "small indigenous groups," we also encountered various ideological obstacles. Compared with the advanced provinces (regions) in the country, Guangxi's industry is backward. Whether it is possible to change this backward state, especially whether it is possible to quickly change this backward state, some people have held skeptical and negative attitudes. They believe that Guangxi's industrial foundation is weak, lacking this and that; the technical force is weak, understanding neither this nor that; with so many difficulties, there is really nothing to be done. Obviously, this pessimistic view is completely wrong and runs counter to the urgent desire of the 20 million working people in the region to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness." If this pessimistic view is not eliminated, Guangxi's industrial construction will be difficult to move forward by leaps and bounds. We resolutely criticized this pessimistic view. We believe that although Guangxi's industry is backward, admitting backwardness does not mean being willing to be backward, and the backward face must be changed by ourselves, and the hat of backwardness must be removed by ourselves. This is the common will of the broad masses of working people in Guangxi, and it is also our guiding ideology for socialist construction. We should look at problems dialectically. Although Guangxi's industrial foundation is backward, it has abundant resources for industrial development and 20 million hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups who, under the guidance and encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, have liberated their minds and dare to think and act, "the poorer, the more revolutionary." Contrary to the views of pessimists, backwardness not only cannot stop us from moving forward but also becomes a positive factor in spurring us to accelerate our progress. If we don't understand industry, we will learn it, learn in motion, and learn from fraternal regions; by constantly learning and constantly creating, we will gradually become familiar with the business, and we will overcome the technical barriers one by one. If the industrial base is weak, we can build small ones if we cannot build large ones, and we can build indigenous ones if we cannot build foreign ones; the industrial base will be gradually established from small to large and from indigenous to foreign. Therefore, the question is whether or not to implement political leadership and liberate the mind. In the past two years, we have resolutely implemented the "walking on two legs" policy instructed by the Party and vigorously developed "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," which has promoted the continuous leap forward of industry, which is the great victory won on the ideological basis of constantly overcoming various pessimistic views and establishing lofty ambitions.

Through vigorous development in the past two years, "small indigenous groups" have blossomed and borne fruit all over Guangxi, from cities to rural areas. According to statistics at the end of May this year, including small enterprises run by urban streets and counties and communes, the region has established 10,747 industrial enterprises. Among them, most of the enterprises developed in 1958 have completed technical transformation and become "small foreign groups." At present, "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" are still developing and improving continuously. Taking Liuzhou City as an example, before liberation, this city had only a dozen dilapidated small factories, including handicraft workshops; but now, it has developed into more than 200 enterprises, initially forming an industrial system including metallurgy, electromechanical, building materials, light chemical industry, etc., and can produce important products such as steel, iron, power machinery, and tractors. It can be said that the vast majority of Guangxi's existing industries, including steel, coal mining, machinery manufacturing, light chemical industry, etc., have been developed from "small indigenous groups." The movement to vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" is a magnificent, mass-based great movement. In this movement, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses have been brought into full play, and many "small indigenous groups" have been established under the conditions of starting from scratch. The slogan of the masses is: if there is no funding, we will raise it ourselves; if there is no equipment, we will make it ourselves; if there are no materials, we will find them ourselves; if there is no technology, we will learn it ourselves. In this way, relying on self-reliance, various industrial enterprises have been established like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. It is precisely because "small indigenous groups" require less investment, simpler equipment, and easier to master technology, it can attract the broadest masses, including handicraft workers, employees' families, street residents, especially the farmers who account for the largest majority of the population, to participate in the great cause of socialist industrialization, and give full play to their initiative. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that "small indigenous groups" have opened up the broadest road for carrying out the mass movement of running industry by the whole people, and the widespread development of this mass movement has in turn promoted the further development and improvement of "small indigenous groups."

Of course, "small indigenous groups" are inevitably relatively simple when they are first established, but they are by no means permanently simple but are constantly developing and improving. Some people just like to find fault with the word "indigenous," and they asserted that indigenous things will definitely not become a trend, and phoenixes will definitely not come out of chicken coops. But before long, these cold words were smashed into powder by the facts. In the past two years, many "small indigenous groups" have developed into "small foreign groups," especially in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement that has been vigorously carried out this year, the fact that many "small indigenous groups" have rapidly changed their appearance has further proved that the idea of "underestimating small and indigenous" is extremely wrong. People have seen that in the great mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "four modernizations," the inventions and creations of "small indigenous groups" are even more than those of some modern large enterprises, which is truly "small factories do big things, and indigenous methods show great power." It is also in this movement that many "small indigenous groups" have been renewed in a few days, and enterprises that were almost entirely operated manually have quickly realized mechanization and automation. Here, let's cite one or two ordinary examples: One is the Liuzhou Rice Noodle Factory. This factory was originally a handicraft workshop with more than 30 people. From feeding, washing rice, grinding powder, steaming powder to finished products leaving the factory, it was all done manually in the past. There was neither an engineer or technician nor a piece of machine equipment in the factory. To say "indigenous," they were really "indigenous" to the extreme. However, this "indigenous" word did not restrain their hands and feet. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, they fully exerted the courage to dare to think and dare to act, designed and manufactured by themselves, and finally produced a rice noodle-making linkage machine. It has jumped from the original manual operation to mechanized production. Recently, they have once again revolutionized the technology and assembled a remote control device in seven days. They have now become the first automated remote control factory in Guangxi's light industry enterprises. Only one person in the factory can operate the machine by pressing a button to produce. Another example is the Guilin Hardware Factory. This factory was established in 1958 by the merger of five handicraft cooperatives. The factory only had 13 old and simple lathes; among the 279 workers, only 64 could use the machines, so the production efficiency was very low, and the product quality was not good. However, after carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the appearance has undergone fundamental changes in a short period of time. Now the factory has 138 machines, and more than 90% of the workers have mastered the skills of machine operation. In particular, the forging workshop of this factory, which has a high labor intensity, has replaced the originally used sledgehammers and indigenous forging furnaces with electric hammers and gas furnaces, and the scene of "no one is seen beside the hammer, the hammer is struck by pressing the electric door; the fire is not baked on the face, and the work is not tiring" has appeared. In terms of labor productivity, it has increased sharply from an average of 430 yuan per person per month in the past to 1,797 yuan; the quality of 11 major products has been significantly improved; and it has developed from only being able to produce simple small products in the past to being able to produce textile machines, high-pressure sprayers, electric small presses and other machines, thus making them enter the ranks of "small foreign groups." There are many similar examples of the Liuzhou Rice Noodle Factory and the Guilin Hardware Factory in the whole region. The moving deeds of these factories have extremely far-reaching significance. It gives us a path for the development of "small indigenous groups." This path is to rapidly realize semi-mechanization and mechanization, and even semi-automation and automation, in "small indigenous groups" through technical innovation and technical revolution movement, so that "small indigenous groups" gradually develop and improve into modern enterprises. The development of the quantity and the improvement of the quality of "small indigenous groups" are mutually promoted and mutually promoted. The continuous development and improvement of "small indigenous group" enterprises have gradually turned into "small foreign groups"; at the same time, new "small indigenous groups" are constantly growing up, thus forming a torrent surging forward wave after wave, wave after wave. The mass movement of vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization that has recently been widely carried out in Guangxi has made many enterprises change from one factory to several factories, and single production to diversified operations, and many new factories have been quickly added, further developing "small indigenous groups." For example, in Wuzhou City, Guangxi, since this year, in conjunction with the establishment of urban people's communes, a total of 350 "satellite factories" and "small indigenous group" production points have been established, and 850 new products have been successfully trial-produced, of which 410 have been put into production. A match factory in this city has launched a mass movement of "five people in one factory, one person in one product," and has established 35 "small indigenous group" "satellite factories." Now, this factory can not only produce matches but also produce dozens of new products such as essence, fertilizer, and furfural. Mother hens leading chicks and vigorously running satellite factories have become a new form of developing "small indigenous groups." Due to the support and cooperation of old factories in terms of equipment, materials, and manpower, these "small indigenous groups" are easier to run and can develop and improve faster. Comprehensive utilization is an effective method to fully exert the effectiveness of material resources, turn useless things into useful things, and turn one-use things into multi-use things, and increase wealth for society. As the workers say: "Comprehensive utilization is infinitely changing, and a shake turns into thousands of prices." Therefore, the method of developing "small indigenous groups" through carrying out comprehensive utilization should be adhered to and implemented to the end.

"Small indigenous groups" are the products of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. In the past two years, it has exerted infinite power and made great achievements in developing industrial construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Practice has proved that vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" is by no means just an expedient measure that Guangxi has to take due to its weak industrial foundation but a long-term strategic policy to accelerate socialist industrialization. We must accelerate Guangxi's industrial construction along this correct path, strive to quickly catch up with the level of advanced provinces and regions in the country, and work with the people of the whole country to quickly build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
