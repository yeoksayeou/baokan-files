"Small Indigenous Groups" are the Correct Path for High-Speed Industrial Development
Qin Yingji, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the industrial construction of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, through the joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the region and the enthusiastic support of fraternal provinces (regions) and cities across the country, is developing at an unprecedented speed. The entire industrial landscape has undergone profound changes. The region has gradually established a number of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" covering various industries such as metallurgy, machinery, coal, electricity, light industry, and chemical industry, from scratch, from small to large, and from indigenous to foreign; and has also established some modern large-scale industrial enterprises. Taking the steel industry as an example, Guangxi did not produce even an ounce of steel during the more than twenty years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. Although some indigenous iron could be produced, the output was very small. After the mass movement of vigorously developing steel in 1958, we not only smelted steel, ending Guangxi's history of not producing steel, but also rolled the smelted steel into steel products. The output of pig iron in the past two years is three times that of the hundred years before liberation; batches of steel "small indigenous groups" have transitioned to "small foreign groups." And on this basis, iron and steel complexes with modern scale, such as Liuzhou and Guixian, are being built. In the coal industry, the region's raw coal output in 1959 increased by about fifty times compared with ten years ago. In addition to the large-scale expansion of the original Heshan and X湾 coal mines, new coal mines with a certain scale and mechanical equipment such as Dongluo, Tunli, Yangliu, Daqing, and Luocheng have also been built; each special district has also built a number of small coal kilns. In terms of the machinery industry, on the eve of liberation, the entire region only had the Liuzhou Agricultural Machinery Company, which had about two hundred workers and less than thirty machine tools. Before liberation, this company could only produce some simple agricultural tools. By the end of 1959, the number of machinery factories with more than 300 people in the region had increased to more than forty; and each county had established a machinery factory. Diesel engines, electric motors, water pumps, transformers, air compressors, tractors, etc., which could not be produced in the past, can now be produced; and the task of producing complete sets of equipment, which could not be undertaken in the past, can now be started. With the rapid development of heavy industries such as steel, coal, electricity, and machinery, other industrial construction has also made great leaps forward. The comprehensive leap forward in industrial construction in the past two years has not only played a huge role in supporting agricultural production and meeting the needs of people's lives but also cultivated a strong contingent of workers of all ethnic groups in the region. At present, the number of employees in industrial and transportation enterprises in the region has increased by eighteen times compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of technicians has increased by twenty-four times compared with the early days of liberation. This has laid a good foundation for further expanding Guangxi's industrial construction in the future.

The speed of Guangxi's industrial development in the past two years has been unprecedented in history. This speed was not only impossible before liberation but also an unprecedented achievement even after liberation. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the speed of industrial construction development in Guangxi can be said to be quite fast, but the development speed in the past two years has far exceeded the First Five-Year Plan period. The growth rate of the region's total industrial output value in 1958 and 1959 was equivalent to 3.1 times and 2.6 times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period, respectively. The main reason why Guangxi's industrial construction has been able to achieve such a high development speed in the past two years is that we have implemented the general line for socialist construction proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs." It is precisely because we resolutely implemented the policy of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises as the main focus; and simultaneously developing foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and advanced along the road of vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" that we were able to achieve a high speed of leap forward in industrial construction.

However, in the process of vigorously developing Guangxi's industrial construction at a high speed along the road of vigorously developing "small indigenous groups," we also encountered various ideological obstacles. Compared with the advanced provinces (regions) in the country, Guangxi's industry is backward. Whether it is possible to change this backward state, especially whether it is possible to quickly change this backward state, some people have held skeptical and negative attitudes. They believe that Guangxi's industrial foundation is weak, lacking this and that; the technical force is weak, understanding neither this nor that; with so many difficulties, there is really nothing to be done. Obviously, this pessimistic view is completely wrong and runs counter to the urgent desire of the 20 million working people in the region to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness." If this pessimistic view is not eliminated, Guangxi's industrial construction will be difficult to move forward by leaps and bounds. We resolutely criticized this pessimistic view. We believe that although Guangxi's industry is backward, admitting backwardness does not mean being willing to be backward, and the backward face must be changed by ourselves, and the hat of backwardness must be removed by ourselves. This is the common will of the broad masses of working people in Guangxi, and it is also our guiding ideology for socialist construction. We should look at problems dialectically. Although Guangxi's industrial foundation is backward, it has abundant resources for industrial development and 20 million hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups who, under the guidance and encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, have liberated their minds and dare to think and act, "the poorer, the more revolutionary." Contrary to the views of pessimists, backwardness not only cannot stop us from moving forward but also becomes a positive factor in spurring us to accelerate our progress. If we don't understand industry, we will learn it, learn in motion, and learn from fraternal regions; by constantly learning and constantly creating, we will gradually become familiar with the business, and we will overcome the technical barriers one by one. If the industrial base is weak, we can build small ones if we cannot build large ones, and we can build indigenous ones if we cannot build foreign ones; the industrial base will be gradually established from small to large and from indigenous to foreign. Therefore, the question is whether or not to implement political leadership and liberate the mind. In the past two years, we have resolutely implemented the "walking on two legs" policy instructed by the Party and vigorously developed "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," which has promoted the continuous leap forward of industry, which is the great victory won on the ideological basis of constantly overcoming various pessimistic views and establishing lofty ambitions.

Through vigorous development in the past two years, "small indigenous groups" have blossomed and borne fruit all over Guangxi, from cities to rural areas. According to statistics at the end of May this year, including small enterprises run by urban streets and counties and communes, the region has established 10,747 industrial enterprises. Among them, most of the enterprises developed in 1958 have completed technical transformation and become "small foreign groups." At present, "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" are still developing and improving continuously. Taking Liuzhou City as an example, before liberation, this city had only a dozen dilapidated small factories, including handicraft workshops; but now, it has developed into more than 200 enterprises, initially forming an industrial system including metallurgy, electromechanical, building materials, light chemical industry, etc., and can produce important products such as steel, iron, power machinery, and tractors. It can be said that the vast majority of Guangxi's existing industries, including steel, coal mining, machinery manufacturing, light chemical industry, etc., have been developed from "small indigenous groups." The movement to vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" is a magnificent, mass-based great movement. In this movement, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses have been brought into full play, and many "small indigenous groups" have been established under the conditions of starting from scratch. The slogan of the masses is: if there is no funding, we will raise it ourselves; if there is no equipment, we will make it ourselves; if there are no materials, we will find them ourselves; if there is no technology, we will learn it ourselves. In this way, relying on self-reliance, various industrial enterprises have been established like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. It is precisely because "small indigenous groups" require less investment, simpler equipment, and easier to master technology, it can attract the broadest masses, including handicraft workers, employees' families, street residents, especially the farmers who account for the largest majority of the population, to participate in the great cause of socialist industrialization, and give full play to their initiative. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that "small indigenous groups" have opened up the broadest road for carrying out the mass movement of running industry by the whole people, and the widespread development of this mass movement has in turn promoted the further development and improvement of "small indigenous groups."

Of course, "small indigenous groups" are inevitably relatively simple when they are first established, but they are by no means permanently simple but are constantly developing and improving. Some people just like to find fault with the word "indigenous," and they asserted that indigenous things will definitely not become a trend, and phoenixes will definitely not come out of chicken coops. But before long, these cold words were smashed into powder by the facts. In the past two years, many "small indigenous groups" have developed into "small foreign groups," especially in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement that has been vigorously carried out this year, the fact that many "small indigenous groups" have rapidly changed their appearance has further proved that the idea of "underestimating small and indigenous" is extremely wrong. People have seen that in the great mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "four modernizations," the inventions and creations of "small indigenous groups" are even more than those of some modern large enterprises, which is truly "small factories do big things, and indigenous methods show great power." It is also in this movement that many "small indigenous groups" have been renewed in a few days, and enterprises that were almost entirely operated manually have quickly realized mechanization and automation. Here, let's cite one or two ordinary examples: One is the Liuzhou Rice Noodle Factory. This factory was originally a handicraft workshop with more than 30 people. From feeding, washing rice, grinding powder, steaming powder to finished products leaving the factory, it was all done manually in the past. There was neither an engineer or technician nor a piece of machine equipment in the factory. To say "indigenous," they were really "indigenous" to the extreme. However, this "indigenous" word did not restrain their hands and feet. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, they fully exerted the courage to dare to think and dare to act, designed and manufactured by themselves, and finally produced a rice noodle-making linkage machine. It has jumped from the original manual operation to mechanized production. Recently, they have once again revolutionized the technology and assembled a remote control device in seven days. They have now become the first automated remote control factory in Guangxi's light industry enterprises. Only one person in the factory can operate the machine by pressing a button to produce. Another example is the Guilin Hardware Factory. This factory was established in 1958 by the merger of five handicraft cooperatives. The factory only had 13 old and simple lathes; among the 279 workers, only 64 could use the machines, so the production efficiency was very low, and the product quality was not good. However, after carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the appearance has undergone fundamental changes in a short period of time. Now the factory has 138 machines, and more than 90% of the workers have mastered the skills of machine operation. In particular, the forging workshop of this factory, which has a high labor intensity, has replaced the originally used sledgehammers and indigenous forging furnaces with electric hammers and gas furnaces, and the scene of "no one is seen beside the hammer, the hammer is struck by pressing the electric door; the fire is not baked on the face, and the work is not tiring" has appeared. In terms of labor productivity, it has increased sharply from an average of 430 yuan per person per month in the past to 1,797 yuan; the quality of 11 major products has been significantly improved; and it has developed from only being able to produce simple small products in the past to being able to produce textile machines, high-pressure sprayers, electric small presses and other machines, thus making them enter the ranks of "small foreign groups." There are many similar examples of the Liuzhou Rice Noodle Factory and the Guilin Hardware Factory in the whole region. The moving deeds of these factories have extremely far-reaching significance. It gives us a path for the development of "small indigenous groups." This path is to rapidly realize semi-mechanization and mechanization, and even semi-automation and automation, in "small indigenous groups" through technical innovation and technical revolution movement, so that "small indigenous groups" gradually develop and improve into modern enterprises. The development of the quantity and the improvement of the quality of "small indigenous groups" are mutually promoted and mutually promoted. The continuous development and improvement of "small indigenous group" enterprises have gradually turned into "small foreign groups"; at the same time, new "small indigenous groups" are constantly growing up, thus forming a torrent surging forward wave after wave, wave after wave. The mass movement of vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization that has recently been widely carried out in Guangxi has made many enterprises change from one factory to several factories, and single production to diversified operations, and many new factories have been quickly added, further developing "small indigenous groups." For example, in Wuzhou City, Guangxi, since this year, in conjunction with the establishment of urban people's communes, a total of 350 "satellite factories" and "small indigenous group" production points have been established, and 850 new products have been successfully trial-produced, of which 410 have been put into production. A match factory in this city has launched a mass movement of "five people in one factory, one person in one product," and has established 35 "small indigenous group" "satellite factories." Now, this factory can not only produce matches but also produce dozens of new products such as essence, fertilizer, and furfural. Mother hens leading chicks and vigorously running satellite factories have become a new form of developing "small indigenous groups." Due to the support and cooperation of old factories in terms of equipment, materials, and manpower, these "small indigenous groups" are easier to run and can develop and improve faster. Comprehensive utilization is an effective method to fully exert the effectiveness of material resources, turn useless things into useful things, and turn one-use things into multi-use things, and increase wealth for society. As the workers say: "Comprehensive utilization is infinitely changing, and a shake turns into thousands of prices." Therefore, the method of developing "small indigenous groups" through carrying out comprehensive utilization should be adhered to and implemented to the end.

"Small indigenous groups" are the products of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. In the past two years, it has exerted infinite power and made great achievements in developing industrial construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Practice has proved that vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" is by no means just an expedient measure that Guangxi has to take due to its weak industrial foundation but a long-term strategic policy to accelerate socialist industrialization. We must accelerate Guangxi's industrial construction along this correct path, strive to quickly catch up with the level of advanced provinces and regions in the country, and work with the people of the whole country to quickly build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    “小土群”是高速度发展工业建设的正确道路
    中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记处书记　覃应机
    大跃进的两年多以来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，广西僮族自治区的工业建设，经过全区各族人民的共同努力和全国各兄弟省（区）市的热情支援，正在以空前高的速度发展着，整个工业面貌已经发生了深刻的变化。全区从无到有，从小到大，从土到洋逐步建立起一批包括冶金、机械、煤炭、电力以及轻化工等各行各业的“小土群”和“小洋群”；并且建立了一些现代化的大型工业企业。以钢铁工业来说，在国民党反动统治的二十多年中间，广西根本没有生产过一斤一两的钢；土铁虽然还能够搞一点，产量也少得很。经过1958年大办钢铁的群众运动，我们不但炼出了钢，结束了广西不产钢的历史，而且把炼出的钢轧成了钢材。两年来的生铁产量，为解放前一百年的三倍；成批的钢铁“小土群”已经过渡到“小洋群”。并且在此基础上，正在建设着具有现代规模的柳州、贵县等钢铁联合企业。煤炭工业，1959年全区原煤产量比十年前增长了五十倍左右，除了大规模地扩建了原有的合山、西湾煤矿以外，还新建了具有一定规模和机械设备的岽罗、屯里、杨柳、大青、罗城等煤矿；各个专区也都建设了不少小煤窑。机械工业方面，解放前夕，全区只有一个二百左右工人，不到三十台机床的柳州农械公司，这个公司在解放前只能生产一些简陋的农具，到1959年底，全区仅三百人以上的机械工厂，就已经增加到四十多个；并且每个县都办起了机械厂。过去不能生产的柴油机、电动机、水泵、变压器、空气压缩机、拖拉机等，现在已经能生产了；过去不能制造配套设备，现在也能够开始担负配套任务了。随着钢铁、煤炭、电力、机械等重工业的飞跃发展，其他各项工业建设，也同样有了极大的跃进。两年来工业建设的全面大跃进，不但在支援农业生产、满足人民生活需要等方面，发挥了巨大的作用，而且为我们培养了一支强大的包括全区各民族的工人队伍。现在，全区工业交通企业的职工人数，比解放初期增加了十八倍，技术人员比解放初期增加了二十四倍。这就为今后更进一步扩大广西的工业建设，打下了良好的基础。
    两年来，广西工业发展的速度，是历史上从来没有过的。这种速度不但在解放前不可能有，就是在解放后，也是一个空前的创举。广西在第一个五年计划期间，工业建设发展的速度，可以说是相当快的，但近两年来的发展速度，却远远超过了第一个五年计划。1958年和1959年全区工业总产值的增长速度，分别相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长速度的三点一倍和二点六倍。两年来广西工业建设所以能够有这样高的发展速度，主要原因是由于我们贯彻执行了党中央和毛泽东同志所提出的社会主义建设总路线，以及一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。正因为我们坚决贯彻执行了大型企业与中小型企业同时并举，而以中小为主；洋法生产与土法生产同时并举，而以土法为主的方针，沿着大力发展“小土群”和“小洋群”的道路前进，才能在工业建设中取得大跃进的高速度。
    但是，我们在沿着大力发展“小土群”的道路高速度地发展广西工业建设的过程中，也遇到了各种各样的思想障碍。同全国的先进省（区）比较起来，广西工业是落后的。能不能改变这种落后状态，特别是能不能迅速改变这种落后状态，有些人曾经抱过怀疑和否定的态度，他们认为，广西工业基础薄弱，要这没这，要那没那；技术力量单薄，这也不懂，那也外行；困难这样多，实在没有什么搞头。显然，这种悲观论调是完全错误的，是同全区二千万劳动人民迫切要求迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的愿望背道而驰的。如果不扫除这种悲观论调，广西的工业建设，就很难大踏步地前进。我们坚决地批判了这种悲观论调。我们认为，广西工业虽然落后，但是，承认落后，决不甘心落后，落后的面貌要自己来改变，落后帽子要自己来摘掉。这是广西广大劳动人民的共同意志，也是我们进行社会主义建设的指导思想。我们应当辩证地看问题。广西虽然工业基础落后，但是它有着发展工业的丰富资源，有着二千万勤劳勇敢的各族人民，他们在毛泽东思想的指引和鼓舞下，思想解放，敢想敢干，“越穷越革命”。同悲观论者的看法相反，落后不但不能阻止我们前进，而且成为鞭策我们加速前进的积极因素。搞工业不懂吗，不懂就学习，在运动中学习，到兄弟地区去取经；不断学习，不断创造，业务就逐步熟识了，技术关就一个个地攻破了。工业基础薄弱吗，不能搞大的可以搞小的，不能搞洋的可以搞土的；由小到大，由土到洋，工业基础就逐步建立起来了。所以，问题还是在于是不是实行政治挂帅，解放了思想。两年来，我们坚决贯彻执行了党所指示的“两条腿走路”的方针，大力发展了“小土群”和“小洋群”，推动了工业的连续大跃进，就是在不断战胜各种悲观论调、树立雄心壮志的思想基础上赢得伟大胜利的。
    经过两年多来的大力发展，“小土群”已经在广西全区，从城市到农村，遍地开花结果。到今年5月底的统计，包括城市街道和县社所举办的小型企业在内，全区已经建立起一万零七百四十七个工业企业。其中在1958年发展起来的企业，大多数已完成了技术改造，成了“小洋群”。目前，“小土群”和“小洋群”仍然在不断发展和提高。以柳州市为例，解放以前，这个市连同手工业作坊在内，总共不过十几个破烂不堪的小厂；而现在，已经发展到二百多个企业，初步形成了一个包括冶金、机电、建筑材料、轻化工业的工业系统，能够生产钢、铁、动力机械、拖拉机等重要产品了。可以说，广西现有工业的绝大部分，包括钢铁、采煤、机械制造、轻化工业等等，都是由“小土群”发展起来的。大办“小土群”的运动，是一个波澜壮阔、千军万马的全民性的伟大运动。在这个运动中，广大群众的积极性和创造性，得到了最大限度的发挥，许多“小土群”，都是在白手兴家的条件下办起来的。群众的口号是：没有资金自己筹，没有设备自己做，没有材料自己找，没有技术自己学。就是这样，依靠自力更生，各种工业企业像雨后春笋一样举办起来了。正是由于“小土群”需要的投资比较少，设备比较简单，技术容易掌握，因此，它就能够吸引最广大的群众，包括手工业工人、职工家属、街道居民，特别是占人口最大多数的农民，都参加到伟大的社会主义工业化事业中来，充分发挥他们的主动积极作用。两年来的事实充分证明：“小土群”为开展全民办工业的群众运动开辟了最广阔的道路，而这个群众运动的广泛开展，又反过来促进了“小土群”的进一步发展和提高。
      “小土群”在开始建立的时候，当然是不免比较简陋的，但是它决不是永远简陋，而是在不断地发展着和提高着。有些人就是爱在这“土”字上面找岔子，他们断言：土东西一定不能成气候，鸡窝里一定出不了凤凰。可是曾几何时，这些冷言冷语就给事实碰成齑粉了。两年来许多“小土群”发展成了“小洋群”，特别是在今年蓬勃开展的技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多“小土群”迅速改变面貌的事实，更加证明那种“轻小轻土”的思想是极端错误的。人们都看到，在以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命的伟大群众运动中，“小土群”的发明创造，甚至比有些现代化的大企业还更多，真是“小厂办大事，土法显威风”。也正是在这个运动中，许多“小土群”几天之内就面貌一新，原来几乎是完全用手工操作的企业，很快就实现了机械化和自动化。这里不妨举一两个普通的例子：一个是柳州市粉丝厂。这个厂原来是一个三十多人的手工作坊，从投料、洗米、磨粉、蒸粉到成品出厂，过去都是靠手工操作。厂内既没有一个工程师或技术员，也没有一台机器设备。要说“土”，他们真是“土”到家了。可是，这个“土”字并没有束缚住他们的手足。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，他们充分发挥了敢想、敢干的勇气，自己设计，自己制造，终于搞出了一台做米粉的联动机。由原来的手工操作一跃而变成了机械化生产。最近，他们又在技术上来了一次革命，用七天时间，装配了一套遥控装置。他们现在已经成了广西轻工业企业第一座自动化遥控工厂。全厂只要一个人按电钮操纵机器就能够生产了。另外一个例子是桂林市的小五金厂。这个厂是在1958年由五个手工业合作社合并成立的。全厂只有十三台破旧的简易车床；在二百七十九个工人中，只有六十四个人能够使用机器，因此，生产效率很低，产品质量也不好。但是，开展技术革新和技术革命运动以后，没有多长的时间，面貌就起了根本的变化。现在全厂已经拥有一百三十八台机器，90％以上的工人掌握了机器操作的技能。特别是这个厂劳动强度很大的锻工车间，已经把原来使用的大锤和土锻炉换成了电动锤和煤气炉，出现了“锤旁不见人，打铁按电门；烧火不烤脸，干活不累人”的景象。在劳动生产率方面，由过去全厂平均每人每月四百三十元，猛增到一千七百九十七元；十一种主要产品质量都有了显著的提高；并且从过去只能生产简单的小产品，发展到能够生产纺织机、高压喷雾器、电动小压机等机具，从而使他们进入了“小洋群”的行列。类似柳州市粉丝厂和桂林市小五金厂的事例，在全区说来是很多的。这些厂的动人事迹，有着极为深远的意义。它给我们提出了“小土群”发展的一条道路。这条道路就是通过技术革新和技术革命运动，在“小土群”中迅速实现半机械化、机械化，以至半自动化、自动化，使“小土群”逐步发展和提高成为现代化的企业。“小土群”数量的发展和质量的提高，是互相推动和互相促进的。“小土群”企业的不断地发展和提高，逐步变成了“小洋群”；同时，新的“小土群”又不断地生长起来，从而一浪推一浪，一浪高一浪，构成了一道滚滚向前的巨流。最近在广西广泛开展起来的大搞综合利用的群众运动，使许多企业一厂变几厂，单一生产变多种经营，很快地又增加了许多新工厂，进一步发展了“小土群”。如广西梧州市，今年以来，结合建立城市人民公社，共办起“卫星厂”和“小土群”生产点三百五十个，试制成功新产品八百五十种，已经投入生产的有四百一十种。这个市的一个火柴厂，开展了“五人一工厂，一人一产品”的群众运动，办起了三十五个“小土群”“卫星厂”。现在，这个厂不仅能生产火柴，还可以生产香精、化肥、糠醛等数十种新产品。母鸡带小鸡，大办卫星厂，已经成为发展“小土群”的一种新形式。由于有老厂的设备、材料、人力等方面的支持和协作，这种“小土群”就更加容易办起来，并且可以更快地发展和提高。综合利用，是充分发挥物质资源的效用，变无用之物为有用之物，变一用之物为多用之物，为社会增加财富的有效方法。正如工人群众说的：“综合利用，变化无穷，摇身一变，身价万千”。因此应当把通过开展综合利用，发展“小土群”的方法坚持贯彻到底。
      “小土群”是总路线、大跃进的产物。两年来，它在多快好省地发展工业建设中，已经发挥了无穷的威力，立下了丰功伟绩。实践证明，大力发展“小土群”，决不是仅仅由于广西工业基础薄弱，不得不采取的权宜之计，而是加速社会主义工业化的一项长期的战略方针。我们必须沿着这条正确的道路，加速广西的工业建设，争取迅速赶上全国先进省区的水平，和全国人民一道，为迅速地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国而奋斗。
