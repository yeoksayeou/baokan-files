Two Hundred Million Latin American People Will Not Allow the U.S. to Act
By Our Staff Commentator

    The United States is intensifying its efforts to manipulate the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the Cuban revolution, but the masses of people throughout the Latin American continent are launching a powerful movement to support Cuba and oppose U.S. interference.

    The recent escalation of U.S. interference in Cuba has aroused the indignation and vigilance of the people of Latin American countries. The people of Latin America have launched movements to protest U.S. interference in Cuba, holding demonstrations and rallies in support of Cuba everywhere. They have voiced militant slogans such as "Aggression against Cuba is aggression against all Latin American people," "Resolutely defend Cuba," and "Unite to defeat U.S. imperialism." The Mexican parliament also issued a statement stating that "Mexico stands with Cuba." The U.S. ruling clique attempts to conceal its isolated position in Latin America, tries to divide the relations between other Latin American countries and Cuba, and woos the governments of some countries to endorse its conspiracy to interfere in Cuba, even openly forcing the Mexican government to state that the parliament's statement does not represent the government's opinion. But no matter how the United States carries out its despicable diplomatic conspiracies, it can never change the fact that "resolutely standing with Cuba" is the unwavering will of the Mexican people and the unwavering will of all the people of Latin American countries. The Mexican people have repeatedly held anti-American demonstrations in recent days, and although they have been suppressed by the government, they still stubbornly insist on supporting the struggle of the Cuban people with actions. On the 16th, two thousand Mexican students held a large-scale demonstration; the increasingly strong anti-American voices from the public in other Latin American countries have fully demonstrated this point. Therefore, even the American magazine "Time" recently pointed out that "a government that votes in the Organization of American States to condemn Castro risks arousing the anger of its own people." The people of Latin American countries will not allow the United States to inflict harm on Cuba, nor will they allow their own governments to act as accomplices to U.S. interventionists.

    The reason why the masses of people in Latin American countries resolutely support the Cuban people's anti-American struggle is not only because the Cuban people's struggle is a just struggle, but also because, as the Latin American people point out, "defending Cuba is defending Latin America." The United States is determined to strangle the Cuban revolution, not only because it is unwilling to lose its vested interests in Cuba, but also because it vainly attempts to contain the burgeoning national democratic revolution in Latin America. In the words of the U.S. ruling clique, it is called "preventing the spread of the Cuban revolutionary plague" and making Latin America forever the "backyard" and private property of the United States. The U.S. State Department recently issued a public statement, resurrecting the "Monroe Doctrine," which serves as a tool for the U.S. to rule the people of Latin America, and arrogantly assuming the role of master of the Americas, clamoring that it has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. Therefore, for all Latin American countries, the struggle against U.S. interference in the Cuban revolution is also a struggle to defend their national independence. The people of Latin America always support each other in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and their unity is being strengthened as never before. Any form of armed intervention by U.S. imperialism in Cuba will inevitably arouse the resolute resistance of the entire Latin American people, and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the face of powerful popular forces.

　　两亿拉丁美洲人民不许美国动手
　　本报评论员
    美国正在加紧策划操纵“美洲国家组织”来干涉古巴的革命，但是整个拉丁美洲大陆上的人民群众，却正在掀起一个支持古巴反对美国干涉的强大运动。
    美国最近变本加厉地进行干涉古巴的活动，已引起了拉丁美洲各国人民的愤慨和警惕。拉丁美洲人民纷纷展开了抗议美国干涉古巴的运动，到处举行支援古巴的示威和集会。他们用响亮的声音喊出“对古巴的侵略就是对所有拉丁美洲人民的侵略”、“坚决保卫古巴”、“团结起来战胜美帝国主义”等战斗口号。墨西哥的议会也发表了声明，表示“墨西哥站在古巴一边”。美国统治集团企图掩饰它在拉丁美洲的孤立处境，竭力分化拉丁美洲其他国家同古巴的关系，并且拉拢一些国家的政府附和它干涉古巴的阴谋，甚至公然迫使墨西哥政府表示议会的声明不代表政府的意见。但是不管美国怎样进行卑鄙的外交阴谋，它无论如何不能改变这样的事实：“坚决站在古巴一边”，这是墨西哥人民不可动摇的意志，也是所有拉丁美洲各国人民不可动摇的意志。墨西哥人民连日一再举行反美示威，虽则遭到政府的镇压，他们还是顽强地以行动坚持支持古巴人民的斗争，16日墨西哥两千学生又举行了大示威；其他拉丁美洲国家的公众也发出了日益强烈的反美呼声，都充分证明了这一点。因此，连美国的“时代”周刊最近也指出，“一国政府如果在美洲国家组织投票谴责卡斯特罗，就有激起本国人民愤怒的危险”。拉丁美洲各国人民不会容许美国对古巴施加毒手，也决不会容许本国政府充当美国干涉者的帮凶。
    拉丁美洲各国人民群众所以坚决支持古巴人民的反美斗争，这不仅是因为古巴人民的斗争是正义的斗争，而且正像拉丁美洲人民所指出的，“保卫古巴就是保卫拉丁美洲”。美国一心要扼杀古巴的革命，除了因为不甘心丧失在古巴的既得利益之外，还妄想遏止正在蓬勃发展的拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，用美国统治集团的话来说，叫做“防止古巴革命瘟疫的传染”，使拉丁美洲永远成为美国的“后院”和禁脔。美国国务院最近公开发表声明，重新搬出作为美国统治拉丁美洲人民的工具的“门罗主义”，俨然以美洲的主人自居，叫嚷有权干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政。因此对于拉丁美洲各国来说，反对美国干涉古巴革命的斗争，也是一个保卫本国民族独立的斗争。拉丁美洲人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中总是互相支援的，他们的团结正在空前地加强。美帝国主义对古巴进行任何形式的武装干涉，都必然要激起整个拉丁美洲人民的坚决反抗，而且必然要在强大的人民力量面前遭到可耻的失败。
