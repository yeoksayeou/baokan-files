Inescapable Guilt
By People's Daily Commentator

The US military in Korea has decided to hold a large-scale so-called "demonstration exercise of anti-communist strategy with atomic weapons" near Dongducheon on July 9th. In this exercise, more than 10,000 US troops will be deployed and "Honest John" rockets, atomic weapons illegally brought into Korean territory in violation of the armistice agreement, will be launched. This exercise by the US military in Korea is a new crime by US imperialism to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, create tension in the Far East, and prepare for a new war, and it is a malicious provocation against the Korean people. Major General Zhu Changjun, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, has lodged a solemn protest against this exercise and demanded an immediate halt to this provocative activity. The Chinese people fully support this protest and strongly condemn this new crime by US imperialism that threatens peace in Korea.

In South Korea, the Heo Jeong group, following the rise of Syngman Rhee, has completely exposed its true colors; it is in the same gang as Syngman Rhee. The South Korean people's struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys has not only not subsided but is continuing to develop vigorously, with calls of "Heo Jeong get out!" and "The Liberal Party and the Democratic Party are both no good!" heard everywhere. Students and farmers in various parts of South Korea have risen up to drive out the loyal American running dogs in the countryside and schools. Students in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheongnam Province, and other places have held demonstrations against the sham elections fabricated by the Heo Jeong group.

Just as US imperialism is again manipulating the Heo Jeong group to stage the farce of the "Fifth National Assembly Election" in South Korea, this large-scale exercise by the US military in Korea is directly intended to boost the morale of the Heo Jeong puppet group, supporting the Heo Jeong group in putting up a false front of "parliamentary democracy" on the one hand to deceive the people, and on the other hand, using the US military in Korea to create a false impression, intimidate and suppress the South Korean people's anti-American patriotic struggle, in an attempt to maintain its colonial rule in South Korea through both soft and hard tactics. At the same time, this provocative action by US imperialism also once again demonstrates its determination to stay in South Korea, undermine and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, occupy South Korea for a long time, continue to pursue a policy of war, and wait for an opportunity to re-launch a war of aggression.

However, the South Korean people fighting for independence and freedom will not be intimidated. The US imperialism's military intimidation will only inspire the South Korean people's fighting spirit against US imperialism and its lackeys to become even stronger. And US imperialism cannot escape full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this serious provocative act of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement in disregard of the protest from the Korean-Chinese side.

    罪责难逃
    本报评论员
    侵朝美军决定7月9日在东豆川附近举行一次大规模的所谓“显示反共战略的原子武器示范演习”。在这次演习中，将出动美军一万余人并将发射违反停战协定非法运入朝鲜境内的原子武器“诚实的约翰”式火箭。侵朝美军的这次演习，是美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定、在远东制造紧张和准备新战争的一次新罪行，而且是对朝鲜人民的恶毒的挑衅。朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将已经就这次演习提出了严正的抗议，并且要求立即停止这种挑衅活动。中国人民完全支持这一抗议，严厉谴责美帝国主义这一威胁朝鲜和平的新罪行。
    在南朝鲜，许政集团继李承晚上台之后，已经完全暴露了它的真面目，它和李承晚都是一丘之貉。南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争不仅没有平息，并且在继续猛烈地发展着，到处发出“许政滚下台！”“自由党、民主党都不是好东西！”的呼声。南朝鲜各地学生、农民纷纷起来赶走农村和学校中的美国忠实走狗，汉城、京畿道、忠清南道等地学生，举行示威，反对许政集团制造的伪选举。
    正当美帝国主义又操纵许政集团在南朝鲜导演“第五届国会选举”丑剧的前夕，侵朝美军的这次大规模演习，是直接给许政傀儡集团打气，支持许政集团一手打出“议会民主”假招牌，来欺骗人民，一手借侵朝美军虚张声势，恫吓和镇压南朝鲜人民的反美爱国斗争，妄图软硬兼施，维护它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。同时，美帝国主义的这一挑衅行动，也再一次表明它决心死赖在南朝鲜不走，破坏和阻挠朝鲜和平统一，长期霸占南朝鲜，继续推行战争政策，等待时机，重新发动侵略战争。
    但是，为独立、自由而斗争的南朝鲜人民是吓不倒的。美帝国主义的武力恫吓只会激发南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗志更加坚强。而美帝国主义对于它这一种不顾朝中方面抗议，破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重挑衅行为所产生的一切后果，难逃它的全部罪责。
