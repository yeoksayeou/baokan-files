　　Deeply Ingrain the Thought of "Going to the Front Lines"
    When the spring sowing began in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province in mid-February this year, signs of drought were already apparent. Preventing and combating drought and sowing in a timely manner became the primary task facing the people of Qinghai. The success of the year depends on the spring; winning this battle would lay the foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. To this end, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee promptly mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to help grassroots units carry out mass movements for spring plowing production and drought prevention and control. The Qinghai Daily gave prominent coverage to this and published an editorial entitled "Going to the Front Lines," elaborating on the great significance of going deep into the front lines of production and calling on cadres to go deep into the grassroots and among the masses.

    Since then, "Going to the Front Lines" has become a very powerful mobilization slogan. To deeply ingrain the thought of "Going to the Front Lines," the newspaper has continuously carried out publicity. To date, eight editorials have been published. With the editorial as the guiding principle, the newspaper has carried out in-depth publicity and reporting work on going to the front lines from various aspects. It not only publicized the leading cadres going deep into the grassroots, but also publicized the grassroots cadres going deep into the field; it not only publicized the cadres on the agricultural front going deep into the fields, but also publicized the office work at the wellheads of the petroleum department cadres and the on-the-job labor of the construction department cadres; it not only publicized the general strengthening of leadership on the front lines, but also highlighted the going to backward areas to grasp the weak links. In these publicity reports, the hard work and down-to-earth efforts of the broad masses of cadres on the front lines, carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, and adhering to the leadership method of combining general calls and individual guidance, were enthusiastically praised. The newspaper successively reported on the gathering of five-level cadres in Minhe County in the fields; the cadres of Datong County concurrently serving as deputy positions at the grassroots level; and the advanced experience of the Mutuz Hala Zhigou Commune carrying out the ten-good cadre full house red competition.

    In strengthening the publicity on the front lines, the Qinghai Daily promoted the mass "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" competition movement by establishing role models for grassroots cadres, which achieved good results. In mid-April, under the ideological guidance of grasping weak links, the newspaper reported that Shen Zhaoyun, the Party branch secretary of the Guanxi Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Datong County, happily accepted the transfer from the commune Party committee, left the advanced production team, and settled in the backward Dongguan Team 1. Due to his in-depth and meticulous work, he prompted Dongguan Team 1 to quickly catch up with the level of the advanced production team. The newspaper prominently publicized Comrade Shen Zhaoyun's noble communist style of "going where there are difficulties, giving way to honors, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward," and called on cadres throughout the province to learn his noble style, go to the most difficult places, participate in production, promote production, go deep among the masses, and lead the masses. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee simultaneously issued a notice requiring cadres in various places to learn from Shen Zhaoyun. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of cadres immediately launched a movement to learn from Shen Zhaoyun, and went to backward teams and poor teams. In the past two months, many Shen Zhaoyun-style cadres have emerged, greatly strengthening the leadership of weak links. The Qinghai Daily reported on the mass movement to learn from Shen Zhaoyun, and also continuously reported on the new developments of Shen Zhaoyun's work style and methods and his advanced deeds in other aspects, so that the movement to learn from Shen Zhaoyun was wave after wave. In the spirit of widely establishing role models, the Qinghai Daily also publicized excellent cadres from various aspects and opened a special column of "Good Party Members on the Front Lines."

    Currently, it is the key season for vigorously grasping field management. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels have continued to mobilize a large number of cadres to go to the forefront of agricultural production. The Qinghai Daily, with the content of "One Heart, One Mind, One Style, Go All Out to Do a Good Job in Field Management," continues to deeply carry out the publicity and reporting of going to the front lines.

　　让“到第一线去”的思想深入人心
    今年2月中旬，青海省农业区开始春播的时候，旱象已经露头。防旱抗旱适时播种是摆在青海人民面前的首要任务。一年之计在于春，打好这一仗，就将为今年农业生产的继续跃进打下基础。为此，青海省委及时动员大批干部下乡，帮助基层开展春耕生产、防旱抗旱的群众运动。青海日报对此作了突出的报道，并以“到第一线去”为题发表社论，阐述了深入生产第一线的重大意义，号召干部深入基层，深入群众。
    从此，“到第一线去”成了一个很有力的动员口号。为使“到第一线去”的思想深入人心，报纸连续地进行宣传。到目前为止，已先后发表了八篇社论。报纸并以社论为纲，从多方面深入地开展了到第一线去的宣传报道工作。不仅宣传了领导干部深入基层，而且宣传了基层干部深入现场；不仅宣传了农业战线的干部深入田间，而且宣传了石油部门干部的井口办公，基建部门干部的跟班劳动等；不仅宣传了普遍加强第一线的领导，而且突出宣传了到后进地区，抓薄弱环节。在这些宣传报道中，热情赞扬了广大干部在第一线上勤勤恳恳、踏踏实实，发扬了党的联系群众的优良传统，坚持执行了一般号召和个别指导相结合的领导方法。报纸先后报道了民和县五级干部会师到田；大通县干部到基层兼任副职；互助哈拉直沟公社开展十好干部满堂红竞赛等先进经验。
    在加强第一线的宣传中，青海日报通过树立基层干部的标兵，推动群众性的“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛运动，收到了良好的效果。4月中旬，报纸在狠抓薄弱环节的思想指导下，报道了大通县城关公社的关西生产队党支部书记沈兆云愉快接受公社党委的调动，离开先进的生产队，到后进的东关一队落户，由于他的深入细致的工作，促使东关一队迅速赶上了先进生产队的水平。报纸突出地宣扬了沈兆云同志这种“见困难就上，见荣誉就让、见先进就学、见后进就帮”的崇高的共产主义风格，并且号召全省干部学习他这种崇高风格，到最困难的地方去，参加生产、促进生产，深入群众、领导群众。青海省委同时发出了要求各地干部向沈兆云学习的通知。在各级党委的领导下，广大干部立即掀起了学习沈兆云的运动，纷纷到后进队去，到穷队去。近两个月来，出现了许许多多沈兆云式的干部，大大加强了薄弱环节的领导。青海日报报道了学习沈兆云的群众运动，同时也连续报道了沈兆云工作作风和工作方法的新发展以及在其他方面的先进事迹，从而使学习沈兆云的运动一浪推一浪。本着广树标兵的精神，青海日报还从多方面宣传了优秀的干部，并开辟了“第一线上好党员”的专栏。
    目前，正是大抓田间管理的关键季节，青海省委和各级党委又继续动员大批干部开赴农业生产最前线。青海日报以“一条心，一股劲、一个样，全力做好田间管理”为内容，继续深入地进行到第一线去的传宣报道。
