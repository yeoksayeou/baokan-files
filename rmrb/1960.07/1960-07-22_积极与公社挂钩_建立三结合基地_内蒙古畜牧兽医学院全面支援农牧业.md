    Actively Link Up with Communes, Establish Three-Combination Bases
    Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Fully Supports Agriculture and Animal Husbandry

    (Our Dispatch) The teachers and students of the Veterinary, Agronomy, and Plant Protection Departments of the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine earnestly implement the three-combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor to comprehensively support agricultural and animal husbandry production.

    By orienting itself toward the actual production conditions of the autonomous region and combining scientific research with the needs of agriculture and animal husbandry, the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine has effectively promoted the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and provided strong support to it. In order to facilitate the smooth progress of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Lambs" campaign and ensure an even greater harvest in animal husbandry, the teachers and students of the Veterinary Department have also successfully developed a traditional Chinese medicine for treating diarrhea in lambs and piglets. The medicine boasts an efficacy rate of over 95%, with a simple method of treatment well suited to the grassland pastoral areas and a very low cost per lamb. As such, it has been well received by the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen.

    While closely coordinating scientific research with agricultural and animal husbandry production, they actively link up with communes, establish three-combination bases, and adopt methods that combine concentration and dispersion, frequent linkage, and short-term combination to provide comprehensive support to agricultural and animal husbandry production. Since March of this year, more than 300 teachers and students from the Institute have respectively linked up with Qingshan People’s Commune and Taipingzhuang People’s Commune in the suburbs of Hohhot, and Jiefangzhen People’s Commune in Linhe County, Bayannur League, and have established three-combination bases. At these bases, the teachers and students learn production knowledge and skills from the masses, while also imparting technical and cultural knowledge to commune members, vigorously assisting the communes in carrying out technological innovation, summarizing production experiences, and conducting scientific research. They also actively assist the commune’s Party and government leaders in completing various work tasks.

    The Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine has trained many technical personnel for rural and pastoral communes through various means, such as running training classes. According to incomplete statistics, the Agronomy and Plant Protection Departments of the Institute have run 30 short-term technical training classes in various communes, training more than 2,000 technical personnel, assisting relevant units in establishing two technical spare-time schools, and helping communes establish four community-run schools.

    Combining graduation internships with sending teachers and students into production to help rural and pastoral communes solve practical problems in production is a consistent and important method adopted by the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine in supporting agriculture and animal husbandry. Last year, more than 50 teachers and students from the Animal Husbandry Department, under the leadership of the Animal Husbandry Bureau, conducted a comprehensive survey of livestock and poultry and a key survey of improved breeds of livestock and poultry in various leagues of the autonomous region. They basically clarified the distribution of livestock (poultry) breeds, breeding, and improvement in the autonomous region, creating favorable conditions for the planned and rapid development of animal husbandry.

    In order to more deeply, regularly, and continuously support the agriculture and animal husbandry of the autonomous region, the Party Committee of the Institute has decided to assign two Party Committee members to be specifically responsible for this work, to ensure the continuity of this work.

### 积极与公社挂钩　建立三结合基地  内蒙古畜牧兽医学院全面支援农牧业

    积极与公社挂钩　建立三结合基地
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院全面支援农牧业
    本报讯　内蒙古畜牧兽医学院兽医、农学和植物保护系的师生，认真贯彻执行教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合，全面支援农牧业生产。
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院由于面向自治区的生产实际，结合农牧业的需要，开展科学研究工作，有力地促进了农牧业生产的发展，有效地支援了农牧业生产。为了促进“百母百仔”运动的顺利发展，保证畜牧业的更大丰收，这个学院的兽医系师生还研究成功一种治疗羔羊拉稀和仔猪下痢的中药，疗效达到了95％以上，而且治疗方法异常简便，非常适用于草原牧区，治疗每只羔羊的成本很低，受到广大农牧民的欢迎。
    在紧密配合农牧业生产进行科学研究的同时，他们积极与公社挂钩，建立三结合基地，并采取了集中与分散、经常挂钩与短期结合的办法，全面支援农牧业生产。从今年3月份以来，这个学院的三百多名师生，分别与呼和浩特市郊区青山人民公社、太平庄人民公社、巴彦淖尔盟的临河县解放镇人民公社等单位挂了钩，并建立了三结合基地。师生们在这些基地一面向群众学习生产知识和技能，一面给社员传授技术和文化知识，大力协助公社搞技术革新、总结生产经验、开展科学研究等工作；同时也积极协助公社的党政领导完成各项工作任务。
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院通过开办训练班等多种多样的形式，给农村牧区各公社培训了许多技术人材。据不完全统计，这个学院的农学系和植物保护系，在各地公社里开办了短期技术训练班三十期，培养出技术人员两千多名，协助有关单位建立了两处技术业余学校，并帮助公社建立了四所民校。
    结合毕业实习，派师生到生产中去帮助农村牧区公社解决生产中的实际问题，这是内蒙古畜牧兽医学院在支援农牧业方面一贯采取的重要办法。去年，这个学院畜牧系的五十多名师生在畜牧厅领导下，深入自治区各盟进行了家畜家禽的普查和良种家畜家禽的重点调查工作。他们基本上摸清了自治区内家畜（禽）、品种分布、选育和改良方面等情况，已为有计划地高速度发展畜牧业创造了有利的条件。
    为了更深入地、经常不断地支援自治区的农牧业，这个学院党委决定由两名党委委员专门负责这一工作，以保证这一工作的经常化。
