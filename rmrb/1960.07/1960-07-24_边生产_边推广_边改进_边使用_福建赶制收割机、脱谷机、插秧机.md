	Fujian Province is adopting the method of combining leadership with the masses, and workers with farmers, to vigorously promote the manufacturing, popularization, maintenance, and use of "Three Machines" (namely harvesters, threshers, and rice transplanters). They are twisting production, promotion, use, repair, and management into one rope to fully support the summer harvest and summer planting in rural areas and accelerate agricultural technological transformation.
	In the process of vigorously building "Three Machines", all localities attach particular importance to ensuring product quality. Many factories have proposed to achieve "manufacture one, promote one, use one." A system of inspection for semi-finished and finished products has been universally established to strictly control quality. Fuzhou City, which undertakes two-thirds of the province's task of manufacturing rapid harvester blades, has formed an inspection team to help factories grasp production progress and quality. As of the 15th, the city had produced more than 240,000 blades, most of which meet the quality requirements. Many counties have also adopted the method of combining leaders, workers, and farmers to conduct trials and improvements during production, continuously improving the quality of the "Three Machines." The First Secretary of the Yongtai County Party Committee personally led members of the County Party Committee, technicians from the agricultural machinery factory, and cadres from the commune production teams to the fields for practical trials when the first batch of harvesters was produced in the county's agricultural machinery factory. They found that the initially produced harvesters were not easy to use, so they conducted "consultations" in the fields, listened to farmers' opinions, and immediately modified the machines after identifying the problems. Thanks to the method of trial and improvement, more than 90% of the 2,000 "Three Machines" produced by the factory met the standards of good quality and suitability for use.
	While vigorously manufacturing "Three Machines", all localities are also universally carrying out inspection and maintenance work on existing "Three Machines". In Minhou County, the County Party Committee's Secretary for Industry took the lead, drawing upon the County Industrial Bureau Director, the Agricultural Machinery Bureau Director, the Party Committee Secretaries of various communes, the Factory Directors of commune-run agricultural machinery factories, technicians, and more than 130 other personnel to form five inspection teams. These teams went to various communes and production teams to help commune members conduct a major inspection of existing "Three Machines". In Jianxin and other communes, they found that the quality of 210 rice transplanters was not high, so they organized workers to renovate and repair them on the spot. After final appraisal, 195 of them met the quality requirements.
	Leaders at all levels are grasping both the manufacturing and inspection/repair of "Three Machines" with one hand, and the promotion, use, and management of "Three Machines" with the other. Many county and commune leaders are taking the lead in using "Three Machines." In Changtai County, County Party Secretaries, Ministers, work team cadres, and leaders such as the Party Committee Secretaries of various communes, not only took the lead in using "Three Machines" but also vigorously publicized the benefits of "Three Machines", quickly promoting more than 650 rice transplanters throughout the county. 80% of the county's continuous cropping of late rice was transplanted using rice transplanters. In the process of promoting the use of "Three Machines", all localities also adopted the method of teaching and practice to train a large number of "Three Machine" operators.

    福建赶制收割机、脱谷机、插秧机
    新华社福州电  福建省各地采取领导与群众结合、工人和农民结合，大抓“三机”（即收割机、脱谷机和插秧机）的制造、推广、维修和使用，把制、推、用、修、管拧成一股绳，全力支援农村夏收夏种，加速农业技术改造。
    各地在大造“三机”中，都特别重视保证产品质量。许多工厂提出要作到“制造一部、推广一部、使用一部”。普遍建立了半成品和成品的检验制度，紧把质量关。承担全省快速收割器刀片制造任务三分之二的福州市，已经组成检查组到各厂帮助抓生产进度和质量。全市到15日止，已制成的二十四万多片刀片，绝大部分符合质量要求。许多县还采取领导、工人和农民三结合办法，实行边制边试边改进，不断提高“三机”质量。中共永泰县委第一书记，在县农械厂制出第一批收割器时，就亲自带领县委委员、农械厂技术工人和公社生产队干部到田间实地试用，发现初制的收割器不太好用，就在田头进行“会诊”，听取农民意见，找出毛病立即修改。由于采取了边试验边改进的方法，全厂制成的二千多部“三机”，有90％以上达到质量良好、适合使用的标准。
    各地在大造“三机”的同时，对原有“三机”也普遍进行检查维修工作。闽侯县由县委工业书记挂帅，抽调了县工业局长、农械局长和各公社党委书记、各社办农械厂厂长、技术工人等一百三十多人，组成五个检查团，到各社、队帮助社员对现有“三机”进行大检查。他们在建新等公社发现有二百一十台插秧机质量不高，便组织工人就地改造维修，最后鉴定，已有一百九十五台达到质量要求。
    各级领导都一手抓“三机”的制造、检修，一手抓“三机”的推广使用和保管。许多县社的领导干部都带头使用“三机”，长泰县下乡的县委书记、部长、工作组干部和各公社党委书记等领导干部，一面带头使用“三机”，一面大张旗鼓地宣传“三机”的好处，很快就在全县推广了六百五十多部插秧机，全县的连作晚稻有80％是用插秧机插秧的。各地在推广使用“三机”中，还采取边讲课边实习的办法培养了大批“三机”手。
