Let Commune Members Wear Straw Sandals to Work in the Fields

　　In summer, many commune members work barefoot in the fields, which makes it easy to get their feet injured. To ensure the safety of commune members' production, our commune recently organized a group of auxiliary laborers in each production brigade to make straw sandals for everyone, producing more than 1,600 pairs of straw sandals per day. The commune supplies the woven straw sandals to commune members of each production team for their use in a planned way. Since commune members started wearing straw sandals to work in the fields, no foot injury accidents have occurred, and everyone says this is a good thing. Commune member Zhang Jiasheng said: "The Party is truly caring for us in every possible way. We must put in even greater effort to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn."

　　让社员穿上草鞋下田
    夏天，有很多社员赤足下田，容易被扎伤脚。为了保证社员安全生产，我们公社最近在各生产大队组织了一部分辅助劳力，给大家打草鞋，每天可打草鞋一千六百多双。公社把编好的草鞋，有计划地供应各生产队的社员穿用。社员穿上草鞋下田，没有发生过刺伤脚的事故，大家都说这件事办得好。社员张家胜说：“党对我们真是无微不至的关怀，我们一定要拿出更大的干劲来，争取秋季大丰收。”
