Visiting Hungary – A Dispatch

　　The Fighting Countryside of Hungary
　　Chen Xiaodong, De Ligel
    Great Achievements of Cooperativization
    During our visit to Hungary, we traveled throughout most of the country, from the hilly areas of Transdanubia to the Bükk Mountains in northern Hungary, and from the west bank of the Danube River to the Great Hungarian Plain in the south. Across this vast land, the sun shone brightly, the spring breeze was pleasant, and the green wheat fields stretched as far as the eye could see, with new seeds sown in large tracts of spring land.
    This is a fighting spring. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the broad masses of Hungarian peasants are firmly embarking on the broad road of cooperativization. Following the second high tide of cooperativization last winter and this spring, by the end of February, there were 4,509 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with nearly 900,000 farmers joining them. The cultivated land area of the cooperatives has reached more than 5.34 million holds (one hold is approximately equal to 8.55 Chinese mu), and together with the cultivated land of state-owned farms, it accounts for 71.5% of the total cultivated land area of the country. More than 2,300 townships have achieved cooperativization, accounting for 73.3% of the total number of townships in the country. The rapid development of the cooperativization movement has brought about fundamental changes of historical significance in the Hungarian countryside. Socialist ownership has taken a dominant position in Hungarian agriculture, thereby opening up a broad road for further developing agricultural production and changing the relatively backward state of agriculture. This spring, Hungarian collective farmers began a new life on the vast lands of the cooperatives. New and old members alike were filled with joy and worked diligently to seize a bumper harvest this year.
    It was in such an extraordinary spring that we visited the "Petőfi Agricultural Production Cooperative" in Somogy County, established in 1949, in early April. In mid-April, we also visited the "Free Land Agricultural Production Cooperative" in Borsod County, established in 1950, and the "Peace Agricultural Production Cooperative," established in November 1948. The members of the "Peace Cooperative," in order to welcome and celebrate the convening of the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, merged with the "Golden Ear Agricultural Production Cooperative" on November 13, 1959, and renamed it the "Seventh Congress of the Party Agricultural Production Cooperative." These three agricultural cooperatives have all bravely fought for ten years on the road of socialist cooperativization, and these three cooperatives are but three of the thousands of glorious agricultural cooperatives in Hungary. For ten years, under the leadership of the Party, they have crushed the sabotage activities of revisionist elements and counter-revolutionaries. They stood firm as the Matra Mountains in the face of the enemy. They grew from small to large, from poor to rich, and set an example for the hardworking Hungarian farmers, pointing out the road—the socialist road, the road for Hungarian farmers to advance together.
    Advancing on a Tortuous Road
    The Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement has taken a healthy development path through tortuous struggles. Over the past decade, Hungary has experienced three distinct periods in the process of cooperativization. In the autumn of 1948, on the basis of land reform, the agricultural cooperativization movement began. By the end of 1952, the cooperativization movement had made considerable achievements, with the total area of collective farms and state-owned farms reaching 22.6% of the total cultivated land area of the country. In 1953, revisionist elements headed by Nagy (then Chairman of the Council of Ministers) used their authority to encourage the development of small-scale farming, spread the idea that small-scale farming could also "grow into" socialism in its "own way," encouraged farmers to withdraw from cooperatives freely, and tolerated the sabotage of cooperativization by rich peasants, resulting in the dissolution of many cooperatives and the withdrawal of many farmers. However, even during these days of rampant countercurrents, many cooperative members still firmly followed the path of cooperativization. Comrade Huszár József, the director of the Petőfi Cooperative, told us that the countercurrent of dissolving cooperatives in 1953 failed to overwhelm the Petőfi Cooperative. Although some middle-peasant members wavered and forty-three people withdrew from the cooperative, there were still eighty-two members, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, who insisted on running the cooperative to the end. At that time, there were more than 3,300 cooperatives like this throughout the country, with more than 193,000 members, and the cultivated land area of the cooperatives still accounted for 16.8%. This was a test and also an exercise.
    In 1955, after the Party cleared up Nagy's mistakes, the cooperativization movement saw new development. However, even more brutal struggles arrived. After the counter-revolutionary riots failed in the cities in November 1956, some counter-revolutionary elements retreated to the countryside, attempting to destroy the socialist positions in the countryside. They used violence to disband cooperatives, and kill Communist Party members, cooperative directors, etc., and for a time dark clouds obscured the sun. It was during such turmoil that the revolutionary peasants of Hungary rose up to defend the socialist system and maintain the socialist positions in the countryside. About 40% of the cooperatives (more than 1,600 cooperatives, with more than 96,000 members) stood firm, some even arming themselves to defend the cooperatives and defeat the enemy's attacks. The Peace Agricultural Cooperative (the predecessor of the "Seventh Congress" Cooperative) was one of them. Comrade Ördög, the fifty-one-year-old director of the "Seventh Congress" Cooperative, was a poor and lower-middle peasant and a Communist Party member. He was the leader and organizer who persisted in the struggle at that time. He told us that during the counter-revolutionary offensive, about 70% of the middle-peasant members in the Peace Cooperative wavered and withdrew from the cooperative, but the Communist Party members and poor and lower-middle peasant members insisted on running the cooperative. In the most difficult times, the Party organization went underground to carry out the struggle. When the revolutionary storm blew away the dark clouds of counter-revolution, the socialist sunshine once again shone on the land. In February 1957, the farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperative requested to rejoin the cooperative, and the cooperatives that had been disbanded were reorganized. The counter-revolutionary riots deeply educated and exercised the working peasants. In the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside, they more firmly chose the socialist road.
    Embarking on the Road of Healthy Development
    After the counter-revolutionary riots were completely crushed throughout the country, the Party took active measures to quickly restore social order and consolidate the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Based on the Marxist-Leninist principle that the socialist system cannot be established on the basis of two forms of ownership for a long time, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party placed the socialist transformation of agriculture on an important agenda. The Party accepted the experiences and lessons from the past two cooperativization struggles, corrected some shortcomings and errors in the past agricultural policy, abolished the grain requisition system, adopted a contract purchase system, and reasonably adjusted purchase prices and a series of other measures, improving the relationship between the Party and the peasants, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. In February and June of 1957, the Party Central Committee made two resolutions, emphasizing the political and economic consolidation of cooperatives, creating favorable conditions for further carrying out the cooperativization movement. The Party's decisions had a good influence in the countryside. Some disbanded cooperatives resumed collective management one after another, and old cooperatives developed production on the original basis. By the end of 1958, the number of cooperatives in the country had recovered and developed to more than 2,700, the number of members had increased to more than 139,000, and the cultivated land area had reached more than 1.1 million holds. Although there was a drought in 1958, the cooperatives brought into play the superiority of collective management, and the average yield per unit area of grain was about 20% higher than that of individual farmers; in that year, the amount of commercial grain, meat, etc. sold by the cooperatives to the state increased by more than 35% compared with 1957. The clear facts of the cooperatives' increased production attracted individual farmers to the road of cooperativization. Over the past two years, the Party has created favorable conditions for rapidly carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture on a nationwide scale in terms of political, economic, and experiential preparations.
    In December 1958, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party issued a resolution to continue carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement, calling on the entire Party, the entire people, government organs, and mass organizations to actively carry out political mobilization and organizational work, mobilize the masses, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and strive to realize agricultural cooperativization. Under this fighting call, in the winter and spring of 1958-1959, an unprecedented agricultural cooperativization upsurge appeared for the first time in the vast countryside of Hungary, and the movement has been advancing along a healthy path. The speed was fast and the scale was large. In just three months, the cultivated land area of the cooperatives increased twofold. By the end of March 1959, the number of cooperatives had increased to more than 4,000, with nearly 500,000 members, an increase of three and a half times, and the cultivated land area reached more than 3 million holds (excluding cooperative teams), plus the cultivated land of state-owned farms, accounting for about 50% of the total cultivated land area of the country. Middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants joined the cooperatives in large numbers: 70% of the new members were middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. Tancsis István, a middle-peasant member of the Petőfi Cooperative, observed for ten years and finally joined the cooperative in February 1959. Entire townships and villages joined the cooperatives, and about 50% of the towns and villages achieved cooperativization, most of them with one cooperative per village.
    Consolidate and Develop in a Wave-like Manner
    After great development, consolidation work must be carried out. In March 1959, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party decided to temporarily stop large-scale development and vigorously rectify and consolidate the new cooperatives. How to improve the level of agricultural production while promoting cooperativization is the key to consolidating cooperatives. In this regard, the Party Central Committee has taken active measures. First, develop and establish Party organizations in the new cooperatives, and absorb activists in the cooperativization movement into the Party in large numbers to strengthen the Party's political leadership. At the same time, actively assist the cooperatives in terms of manpower and material resources. Last year, the central and local governments transferred nearly 2,000 political workers and 3,000 technicians such as accountants and agronomists to work in the cooperatives, greatly strengthening the leadership of the cooperatives; the state provided loans of 2.5 billion forints (Hungarian currency) as expenses for the cooperatives to purchase means of production, etc. Factories, state-owned farms, Party and government organs, and mass organizations throughout the country were respectively linked to a cooperative to help the cooperatives politically, materially, and technically. The eighteen Party branches (eighteen workshops) of the Lenin United Steel Plant in Borsod County supported eighteen cooperatives respectively. Last year, the workers did 3,600 hours of voluntary labor in the agricultural cooperatives, helping the cooperatives build livestock sheds, repair small machines, install electric wires and water pipes, harvest crops, etc., and held regular worker-peasant get-togethers. With the mobilization of the entire Party and all-out support, in 1959, the average grain yield per unit area of agricultural cooperatives nationwide was 25%-30% higher than that of individual farmers; the total agricultural output increased by 5.7% compared with 1958, and the amount of purchases increased by 7.3%. While the cooperatives developed and production increased, the funds of the cooperatives increased by about one time compared with 1958; the income of the members also increased accordingly. In 1959, the value of each labor day increased by 12.1% compared with 1958, and the average income of each household of old cooperative members increased by 17% compared with 1958. This iron fact eloquently proves that it is entirely possible to continuously improve agricultural production and commodity production while carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    Consolidating on the basis of great development, developing on the basis of consolidation, advancing in stages and batches in a wave-like manner – this is an important working method adopted by Hungary in the agricultural cooperativization movement.
    In the first upsurge of cooperativization and the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives and improving agricultural production in 1959, the Party gained rich experience, and the broad masses of working peasants also received a deeper education. In order to continue to move forward and organize more farmers into cooperatives, the Party Central Committee passed a resolution at the plenary session of the Central Committee in October 1959, proposing active preparations to organize the second upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in the winter and spring of 1959-1960. After the Seventh Congress of the Party in December, a new upsurge of agricultural cooperativization appeared in the vast countryside. Many old cooperatives were expanded and new cooperatives were established. By the end of February this year, about 72% of the cultivated land and about 73% of the towns and villages had been cooperativized, and the face of the countryside had undergone tremendous changes. Socialist relations of production have taken a dominant position in agriculture. This torrent of socialist revolution cannot be blocked by any imperialism or revisionist elements, and no force can make the Hungarian peasants leave the socialist road.

        Striving Towards New Goals
    The great victory of the cooperativization movement has ushered in a period of prosperity and upswing in Hungarian agricultural production. The planned total agricultural output in 1960 will increase by 4.9% compared with 1959, and the amount of commodity purchases will increase by 8.9%. Under the leadership of the Party, cooperatives across the country are full of vigor and enthusiasm, moving towards new goals. The Party branch of the "Seventh Congress" Cooperative has made a resolution that agricultural production in 1960 will increase by 6% compared with 1959, and costs will be reduced by 3%; the number of pigs will increase from more than 500 to 959, the number of cattle will increase from 300 to 535, and the number of sheep will increase from more than 1,800 to more than 2,300. The Petőfi Cooperative plans to increase the total income of agricultural animal husbandry in 1960 by 45% compared with 1959. Production teams in many cooperatives have launched labor competitions, determined to seize a greater harvest in the first year of the 1960s. Comrade Ördög, the old director of the "Seventh Congress" Cooperative, enthusiastically told us that they want to work actively, which is to accelerate socialist construction and to advance towards communism. His words are precisely the common ideal of the Hungarian working people. Millions of people, under the leadership of the Party, are tirelessly striving to realize this ideal.
    As we were about to leave Hungary, our Hungarian comrades told us with confidence that if the cooperatives can be better consolidated politically and economically this year, and production can be further developed, then it can be expected that with another new upsurge of the cooperativization movement in the winter and spring, the task of socialist transformation of agriculture throughout Hungary may be successfully completed.

　　匈牙利战斗的农村
　　陈晓东　德礼格尔
    合作化的巨大成就
    在访问匈牙利的日子里，我们走遍了大半个匈牙利。从外多瑙河的丘陵地带，到匈牙利北部的比由克山区；从多瑙河西岸，到匈牙利南部的大平原。在这广阔的土地上，阳光灿烂，春风宜人，碧绿的麦田一望无际，大片春地上播种了新的种子。
    这是一个战斗的春天。匈牙利的广大农民，在社会主义工人党的领导下，坚定地走上合作化的康庄大道，在去冬今春合作化第二个高潮之后，到2月底，全国已有四千五百零九个农业生产合作社，近九十万农民加入了合作社，合作社的耕地面积已达五百三十四万多霍尔特（一霍尔特约合我国8.55市亩），连同国营农场的耕地在内，已占全国耕地总面积的71.5％，实现了合作化的乡已有二千三百多个，占全国乡的总数73.3％。合作化运动的迅速发展，已使匈牙利的农村发生了有历史意义的根本性的变化，社会主义所有制，已在匈牙利的农业中占了优势，从而为进一步发展农业生产，改变农业相对落后的状况开辟了宽广的道路。在今年的春天里，匈牙利的集体农民，在合作社大片的土地上开始了新的生活，新老社员们喜气洋洋，为夺取今年的大丰收在进行辛勤劳动。
    就是在这样一个不平凡的春天里，我们在4月上旬访问了绍莫吉州1949年成立的“裴多菲农业生产合作社”；4月中旬，我们又访问了波尔索德州1950年建立的“自由土地农业生产合作社”和1948年11年建立的“和平农业生产合作社”。“和平社”的社员们，为了迎接和庆祝匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会的召开，在1959年11月13日，与“金穗农业生产合作社”合并，命名为“党的七次代表大会农业生产合作社”。这三个农业合作社，都是在社会主义合作化的道路上，勇敢地战斗了十年，而这三个社不过是匈牙利千百个光荣的农业合作社中的三个。十年来，它们在党的领导下，粉碎了修正主义分子和反革命的破坏活动，它们在敌人面前像马特拉山一样，屹然不动；它们由小变大、由穷变富，为勤劳的匈牙利农民作出了榜样，指明了道路——社会主义的道路，这是匈牙利农民共同前进的道路。
    在曲折的道路上前进
    匈牙利农业合作化运动是在曲折的斗争中走上健康发展的道路的。十年来，在合作化的进程中，匈牙利经历了三个不同的时期。1948年秋，在土地改革的基础上，农业合作化运动就开始了，到1952年底，合作化运动取得了不少的成绩，集体经营和国营农场的耕地总面积已达全国耕地总面积的22.6％。1953年，以纳吉
  （当时的部长会议主席）为首的修正主义分子利用他们的职权，鼓励发展小农经济，散布小农经济也能按照“自己的方式”“长入”社会主义，鼓励农民自由退社，容忍富农破坏合作化，致使许多社被解散，许多农民退了社。但是就在这些逆流泛滥的日子里，仍有许多合作社社员坚定地走合作化的道路。裴多菲合作社的社主任胡萨尔·约瑟夫同志告诉我们，1953年的垮社逆流，没有能够冲垮裴多菲合作社，虽然一部分中农社员发生动摇，有四十三人退出了合作社，但是仍有以贫雇农为骨干的八十二名社员坚持办社到底。像这样的合作社，全国当时就有三千三百多处，社员有十九万三千多人，合作社的耕地面积还有16.8％。这是一次考验，也是一次锻炼。
    1955年，党清除了纳吉的错误之后，合作化运动又有了新的发展。但是，更残酷的斗争到来了。当1956年11月反革命暴乱在城市失败之后，一部分反革命分子退却到农村，企图摧毁农村的社会主义阵地。他们用暴力解散合作社，杀害共产党员、社主任等，一时乌云遮住了太阳。就在这样动乱的时候，匈牙利革命的农民，起而保卫社会主义制度，坚持农村的社会主义阵地，其中约有40％左右的合作社（一千六百余处合作社，九万六千余社员），坚定不移，有的则武装起来保卫合作社，打垮了敌人的进攻。和平农业合作社（“七大”合作社的前身）就是其中的一个。“七大”合作社五十一岁的社长欧尔得格同志是贫雇农，共产党员，是当时坚持斗争的领导者和组织者。他对我们说，在反革命进攻的时候，和平社里的中农社员约有70％动摇退社了，但是共产党员和贫雇农社员一直坚持办社。在最困难的时候，党组织转入了地下斗争。当革命的风暴吹散了反革命的乌云的时候，社会主义的阳光重新普照大地，就在1957年的2月，退社的农民又要求重新入社了，一时散伙的合作社又重新组织起来了。反革命暴乱深深地教育和锻炼了劳动农民，在农村社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争中，他们更坚定地选择了社会主义的道路。
    走上健康发展的大道
    当反革命暴乱在全国范围内被彻底粉碎后，党采取积极的行动，迅速恢复了社会秩序，巩固了社会主义制度和无产阶级专政。根据社会主义制度不能长期建立在两种所有制基础之上的马克思列宁主义的原理，匈牙利社会主义工人党把农业的社会主义改造提到重要的议事日程上来了。党接受了过去两次合作化斗争中的经验教训，纠正了过去农业政策中的某些缺点、错误，取消了粮食征购制，采取了合同收购制，合理地调整了收购价格等一系列措施，改善了党和农民的关系，农民信任和拥护党的政策，加强了工农联盟。1957年2月和6月，党中央两次作出决议，强调从政治上、经济上巩固合作社，为进一步开展合作化运动创造了有利条件。党的决定在农村中产生了良好的影响，一些散了的合作社纷纷恢复了集体经营，老社在原有的基础上发展了生产。到1958年底，全国合作社恢复和发展到二千七百余个，社员增加到十三万九千余人，入社耕地一百一十余万霍尔特。1958年虽然天旱，但合作社发挥了集体经营的优越性，谷物单位面积产量平均比单干农民高出20％左右；这一年合作社卖给国家的商品粮食、肉类等，比1957年增加了35％以上。合作社增产的鲜明事实，吸引着个体农民奔向合作化的道路。两年来，党从政治上、经济上和经验准备上，为在全国范围内迅速开展农业社会主义改造运动创造了有利条件。
    1958年12月，社会主义工人党中央全会发出了继续开展农业合作化运动的决议，号召全党全民、机关和群众团体，积极进行政治动员和组织工作，发动群众，坚持自愿原则，为实现农业合作化而奋斗。在这一战斗的号召下，1958—1959年的冬春，匈牙利的广大农村，第一次出现了空前规模的农业合作化高潮，运动一直沿着健康的道路前进。速度快，规模大，仅三个月的时间，入社耕地就增加了两倍。到1959年3月底，合作社增加到四千余个，社员近五十万人，增加了三倍半，入社耕地达三百余万霍尔特（均不包括合作组），加上国营农场的耕地，占全国耕地总面积的50％左右。中农、富裕中农成批入社：新社员中，70％是中农、富裕中农。裴多菲合作社中农社员坦齐什·伊斯特万，观望了十年，终于在1959年2月参加了合作社。整乡整村入社，约50％的村镇实现了合作化，大部分是一村一社。
    巩固发展波浪式前进
    大发展之后，必须进行巩固工作。匈牙利社会主义工人党中央在1959年3月，决定暂时停止大规模的发展，大力整顿巩固新社。如何在合作化的同时提高农业的生产水平，这是巩固合作社的关键。对此，党中央采取了积极的措施。首先在新社里发展和建立党的组织，大批地吸收合作化运动中的积极分子入党，加强党的政治领导。同时，从人力、物力上积极援助合作社。去年一年，中央和地方抽调近二千名政治工作人员和三千名会计、农艺师等技术人员到合作社工作，大大加强了合作社的领导力量；国家贷款二十五亿福林（匈币），作为合作社购买生产资料等的用费。全国工厂、国营农场、党政机关、群众团体，分别和一个合作社挂钩，从政治上、物质和技术上帮助合作社。波尔索德州的列宁联合钢铁厂的十八个党支部（十八个车间）分别支援十八个合作社，去年工人们到农业社做了三千六百个小时的义务劳动，帮助合作社造牲口棚，修理小机器，装配电线、水管，收割农作物等等，而且定期举行工农联欢。在全党动员、全力以赴的支援下，1959年，全国农业合作社谷物单位面积产量平均比个体农民高出25％—30％；农业总产量比1958年增长了5.7％，收购量增加了7.3％。在合作社发展和生产增长的同时，合作社的资金比1958年增加了约一倍；社员的收入也相应地提高了。1959年每一个劳动日的代价比1958年提高了12.1％，老社社员每户的收入，平均比1958年增加了17％。这个铁的事实，雄辩地证明了，在农业社会主义改造的同时，不断提高农业生产和商品生产是完全可能的。
    在大发展的基础上进行巩固，在巩固的基础上进行发展，分期分批，波浪式前进，这是匈牙利在农业合作化运动中所采取的重要的工作方法。
    在第一个合作化高潮和1959年整顿巩固合作社，提高农业生产的工作中，党取得了丰富的经验，广大劳动农民也受到了更深刻的教育。要继续前进，把更多的农民组织到合作社中来，党中央就在1959年10月中央全会上通过了决议，提出积极准备，在1959—1960年的冬春组织第二个农业合作化高潮。12月，党的七次代表大会之后，广大农村出现了农业合作化的新高潮，许多老社扩大了，新社成立了，到今年2月底，72％左右的耕地和73％左右的村镇合作化了，农村的面貌发生了巨大的变化，社会主义生产关系已在农业中占了优势。这一社会主义革命的洪流，是任何帝国主义和修正主义分子阻挡不了，也没有任何力量能够使匈牙利的农民离开社会主义道路。
        奔向新的目标
    合作化运动的伟大胜利，使匈牙利的农业生产开始了一个繁荣高涨的时期。1960年计划农业总产量比1959年提高4.9％，商品收购量增加8.9％。全国各地合作社在党的领导下，朝气勃勃，热情高涨，向着新的目标前进。“七大”合作社党支部已作出决议，1960年农业生产要比1959年提高6％，成本降低3％；猪要从五百多头增至九百五十九头，牛要从三百头增至五百三十五头，羊要从一千八百多头增至二千三百多头。裴多菲合作社计划1960年的农业畜牧业总收入要比1959年增加45％。许多合作社的生产队展开了劳动竞赛，决心夺取六十年代第一年的更大丰收。“七大”合作社的老社长欧尔得格同志热情地对我们说，他们要积极工作，这是为了加速社会主义建设，并要向共产主义前进。他的话，正是匈牙利劳动人民共同的理想。千百万人民，在党的领导下，为实现这一理想而奋斗不息。
    在我们行将离开匈牙利的时候，匈牙利的同志满怀信心地告诉我们说，如果今年合作社在政治上、经济上更好地巩固下来，生产有了进一步的发展，那么，可以预期，再有一个冬春的合作化运动新高潮，匈牙利全国农业社会主义改造的任务就可能胜利完成了。
