Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - The four preliminary meetings held in Melun, near Paris, between Algeria and France have demonstrated that the French colonialists have no sincerity in these negotiations and are merely attempting to use them to induce the Algerian people to lay down their arms.

Statements made by French officials during the negotiations have emphasized that France wants to continue controlling Algeria and that the negotiations only concern the issue of a ceasefire. French Prime Minister Debré, in a speech in Nancy on the 25th, said that Algeria and France should be "most closely united" as much as possible. He said: "There is no other possible future" besides this "close union."

Debré said that the issue of the union between France and Algeria is "a question of defending our (France's) fundamental interests, our economic interests, and the interests of our citizens."

When discussing the Algerian people's right to self-determination, Debré stated that the Algerian people would only be able to exercise this right "after the ceasefire leads to the end of terrorist (military) actions and Algeria becomes calm." Debré also said: "Self-determination will guarantee that our legitimate rights in Algeria and our interests and various collectives are respected."

The French government's delegate-general to Algeria, Delouvrier, also reiterated France's colonial demands on Algeria in a speech to the Algiers Chamber of Commerce on the 29th. He said, "We must show that Algeria's fate can only be resolved in the freedom of the West, in union with France."

Referring to the negotiations between France and Algeria, Delouvrier said that the French government "only intends to discuss methods of stopping the (Algerian) fighting." He said, "You know his (de Gaulle's) uncompromising nature."

France is obstructing the reaching of an agreement in the negotiation process. Agence France-Presse yesterday issued a dispatch from Tunis quoting sources close to the Algerian Provisional Government as saying that the talks held in Melun between Algeria and France "are not going well." These sources said that France "wants to respond to all the Algerian suggestions with denial or evasion."

Reuters issued a dispatch from Tunis on the same day stating that France had suggested that the Algerian Provisional Government "cease fighting during the negotiations, before a final agreement is reached." This shows France's attempt to use negotiations as a means of putting pressure on Algeria and forcing the Algerian National Liberation Army to lay down its arms.

The dispatch also said that De Gaulle is unwilling to meet with Algerian Prime Minister Abbas before the cessation of fighting.

    法国总理德勃雷发表演说表示
    法国想通过谈判继续控制阿尔及利亚
    新华社巴黎30日电　阿尔及利亚和法国之间在巴黎附近默伦举行的四次预备会议表明法国殖民者对这次谈判没有诚意，只是企图利用谈判来诱使阿尔及利亚人民放下武器。
    法国负责人士在谈判期间发表的一些言论都强调法国要继续控制阿尔及利亚和谈判只谈停火问题。法国总理德勃雷25日在南锡发表演说时说，阿尔及利亚同法国应该尽可能“最紧密地联合”在一起。他说：除了这种“紧密联合”之外，“没有其他可能的前途”。
    德勃雷说，法国同阿尔及利亚的联合的问题是“保卫我们（法国）的基本利益、我们的经济利益和我们的公民的利益的问题”。
    德勃雷在谈到阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利时表示，阿尔及利亚人民要到“停火导致恐怖（军事）行动终止、阿尔及利亚平静下来以后”，才能行使这种权利。德勃雷还说：“自决权将保证我们在阿尔及利亚的合法权利和我们的利益和各个集体得到尊重。”
    法国政府驻阿尔及利亚总代表德路弗里埃29日在阿尔及尔商会讲话时也重申法国对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义要求。他说，“我们必须表明，阿尔及利亚的命运只能在西方的自由中、在与法国的联合中得到解决”。
    德路弗里埃在谈到法、阿双方的谈判时说，法国政府“只打算讨论停止（阿尔及利亚）战斗的方法”。他说，“你们是知道他（戴高乐）的不妥协性格的”。
    法国在谈判过程中阻挠达成协议。法新社昨天从突尼斯发出的一条消息引用接近阿尔及利亚临时政府人士的话说，阿尔及利亚和法国双方在默伦举行的会谈“进行得不很好”。这些人士说，法国“想用否定或者逃避的方式答复阿尔及利亚方面所有的建议”。
    路透社同一天从突尼斯发出的消息说，法国曾建议阿尔及利亚临时政府“在谈判期间、达成最后协议以前，停止战斗行动”。这表明法国的企图用谈判作手段向阿尔及利亚施加压力，要阿尔及利亚民族解放军放下武器。
    这条消息还说，戴高乐不愿意在战斗停止以前会见阿尔及利亚总理阿巴斯。
