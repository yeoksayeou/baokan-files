	Tangshan Steel Plant Leaders Adopt Furnace Responsibility System
	Leaders of the Tangshan Steel Plant have adopted a furnace responsibility system, with the Party Secretary taking the lead in forming working groups. Dedicated personnel are responsible for each process, from batching, charging, iron smelting, converter operation, all the way to ingot making, slag removal, and transportation. They adopted a "two-pronged" approach, both helping groups organize and mobilize the masses, doing a good job in political and ideological work, and helping groups solve key production problems, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience.
	In order to systematically summarize experience, cadres of the working group hold daily meetings to collate and improve the scattered experiences that emerge each day, combining them into complete sets. Now, the working group has summarized advanced experiences such as raw material ratio, which is being comprehensively promoted in the Second Steelmaking Workshop.
	Timely Summary of "Experimental Plot" Experiences
	Leading cadres of the CCP Nanjing Municipal Construction Engineering Committee and the Urban Construction Bureau, starting in mid-May, led working groups deep into construction sites to cultivate "experimental plots," promptly summarizing experiences, affirming the leadership method of prioritizing "depth" (going deep), starting with "help" (helping grassroots work), and focusing on "comprehensiveness" (summarizing experience to guide comprehensively) in cultivating experimental plots. They also disseminated it everywhere through meetings, roving inspections, and other forms. Now, 80% of the companies affiliated with the Urban Construction Bureau have cadres going deep into the front line of production, participating in production, and leading production.
	Turning Collective Dormitories into Communist Education Bases
	The CCP Anshan Municipal Committee has mobilized the entire Party to work together, to improve the political and ideological and management work of collective dormitories, making collective dormitories a communist education base for comprehensively organizing workers' political, cultural, and material lives. More than thirty "red dormitories," two "red banner buildings," and many study pacesetters have now emerged. Some factories and mines have even established Party branches in collective dormitories to strengthen leadership over dormitory work.
	Shanxi Mechanical Industry Promotes Chipless Machining
	The Shanxi Province mechanical industry vigorously promotes chipless or less-chipless machining, widely adopting advanced casting and forging methods such as metal mold casting, graphite mold casting, investment casting, shell mold casting, die casting, centrifugal casting, and forging, upsetting, pressing, extruding, drawing, rolling, expanding, precision forging, etc., so that castings and forgings can be assembled into finished products without cutting or only after finishing. Currently, incomplete statistics from only thirteen units, such as Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, and Shanxi Machine Factory, show that more than six hundred kinds of parts and components have achieved chipless machining or less-chipless machining.
	Wuhan Boiler Factory Fully Put into Production
	China's key construction project—the Wuhan Boiler Factory—was fully put into production on June 28. After inspection and appraisal by the Wuhan Boiler Factory National Acceptance Committee, the overall construction quality of the Wuhan Boiler Factory was rated as excellent. From then on, this factory officially entered the ranks of the motherland's power machinery industry and became another new and powerful electric power machinery industrial base in our country.
	10,000-ton Coal Ship Loaded in Four Hours

This is 29.25% shorter than the new record of five hours and ten minutes created in May. The cabin-hour volume reached 449.7 tons, an increase of 11.7% over the previous highest efficiency.
	Yangzhou Automobile Repair Plant Produces Trucks
	Employees of the Jiangsu Province Yangzhou Automobile Repair Plant spent more than a month manufacturing twenty Yunhe-brand automobiles. These automobiles are medium-sized trucks with a deadweight of 2.5 tons. 30% of the parts on these automobiles are made of substitute materials, and the quality fully meets the requirements.
