Carry Forward Revolutionary Traditions and Style
The Political Commissar and the Sailor

One day, sailors on a naval warship were busy carrying coal. In the crowd, a middle-aged man of short stature, wearing a faded blue military uniform with his trouser legs rolled up high, was covered in sweat. He carried a full basket of coal, running and laughing, "Come on, lads, work hard!"

"Who is this?" asked a new recruit.

"That's our political commissar!"

"Oh, the political commissar!" The new recruit didn't expect that this was their leader, Min Fanyi. He thought, "The leaders are working with us." And couldn't help but put in more effort.

It was common for Political Commissar Min Fanyi to work alongside the sailors. He always led his soldiers by his own exemplary actions. He not only provided specific guidance for all the work on the ship, large and small, but also participated in it personally. When the ship docked, he helped to drag the mooring lines. When cleaning the large cabins, he helped to pull the boiler tubes, always picking the heavy work. To ensure safety, he never left the command platform during each voyage, assisting the captain in handling issues. He also stood watch as usual at night. When the soldiers advised him to rest, he said, "This is what the regulations stipulate, and they should be followed."

Whenever faced with difficulties and dangers, Political Commissar Min always took the lead. One evening, a force six or seven gale blew up at sea. The higher authorities suddenly issued an order to send a small boat to carry out an urgent mission. Upon hearing about the urgent mission, the soldiers all scrambled to volunteer. Political Commissar Min looked at the excited faces of the soldiers, nodded, and then looked out at the sea. The dark waves were like undulating hills. The waves crashed against the ship's side, and the spray that splashed up fell like a waterfall, drenching his face with cold seawater. He turned his head and said, "Let me go!" Then, despite everyone's persuasion, he jumped into the small boat. The soldiers stood on the bow of the ship, watching the small boat gradually disappear into the waves and darkness, filled with infinite excitement.

Political Commissar Min loved the soldiers and was very concerned about their progress. He labored, ate, studied, and entertained with them. He visited each squad every day, talking with the soldiers, understanding each person's thoughts and temperament, discovering problems at any time, and helping to solve them. Once, he participated in dragging mooring lines with the gun and artillery squad and found that some soldiers' skills were not high, and they had difficulty doing the work. In the evening, he organized a forum for the soldiers to summarize their experiences in light of the day's operations. At the meeting, he also introduced his own experience in dragging mooring lines to the soldiers.

Because Political Commissar Min treated people equally and cared for the masses, the soldiers respected him very much, trusted him, and regarded him as a confidant. As long as he said a word, the lads would rush to do it like tigers descending from the mountain.

"Old Eighth Route Army" Style

Jia Xueyi, a leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, had been wounded seven times in the years of fighting, resulting in a disabled left arm and blindness in his left eye. However, his "Old Eighth Route Army" style, which had been forged in the crucible of the revolutionary army for a long time, became stronger and stronger.

He worked in a transportation department. In addition to office work every day, he always took time to go to the vehicle yard and down to the company. Every sentry could recognize the sound of the leader's footsteps from afar. Because he went deep among the masses, he knew the work and living conditions of the soldiers like the back of his hand, and no new things in the company could escape his eyes. For example, when he discovered that some cadres in the unit had the idea of being "at the top of the Great Leap Forward," he went to the vehicle yard to understand the reactions of the masses. After hearing the driver Huang Fuyi's suggestion of "leave early, return late, and strengthen vehicle maintenance to drive more," he immediately discussed it with the Party committee and turned this suggestion into the unit's battle slogan, launching a mass movement that greatly increased the vehicle sortie rate.

His concern for the masses was even more meticulous. He often took advantage of holidays to visit soldiers on scattered sentry duty. One snowy night last winter, he went to check the bedding in the third company and saw two soldiers sleeping with their quilts kicked off and their chests exposed. He gently covered them with their quilts and turned off the lights. Before leaving, he repeatedly told the company's cadres to check the bedding more often to prevent the soldiers from catching a cold. Because one of his eyes was disabled, it was very inconvenient for him to go out to check the bedding at night, but he still went out to check the bedding, check the sentry posts, and check the vehicle yard night after night.

Over the years, Jia Xueyi has maintained the excellent style of the "Old Eighth Route Army," not only being serious and conscientious in his work, doing what he said, and never putting off today's work until tomorrow, but also maintaining a hard-working and simple style in his life. Jia Xueyi was a production model in the Nanniwan Great Production Movement of the Eighth Route Army in those years. Today, he still retains the true qualities of a labor model. When the unit carried out agricultural and sideline production, he waved his only right arm and farmed the land with the soldiers. When the unit made steel, he fought all night by the furnace. The soldiers said: The leader's vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and hardworking spirit will always be a model for us to learn from.

The Soldier's Good Company Commander

At a certain railway construction site of the Railway Corps, whether the sun was scorching or the rain was pouring down, you could see a tall, strong cadre working alongside the soldiers. He was Li Fengxiang, the company commander of the ninth company of a certain unit.

Speaking of Company Commander Li, every soldier can tell many touching stories.

One day, the ninth company was blasting on a mountain. A new gunner lit the fuse. Because he was flustered, he ran too quickly, and one of his feet got caught in a crack in the stone, causing him to fall and unable to pull it out. The detonator was emitting green smoke, and the blasting hole was about to explode. At this time, Li Fengxiang ran forward without fear, helped the gunner pull out his foot, and carried him on his back to run. Before he ran out of the danger zone, there was a loud bang, the explosion went off, and a large number of stones flew into the sky. Li Fengxiang quickly put the soldier he was carrying down and used his body to shield him until the explosion was over before climbing out of the mud.

Another time, the ninth company was building the Xiyangjiang Bridge. One evening after work, a sudden torrential rain came down, and the river water rose sharply. The generator on the construction site was half submerged by the flood, and there was a danger of being washed away at any time. At this time, Li Fengxiang happened to come to the construction site for inspection. After seeing this, he immediately jumped into the cold water, used a rope to tie the generator to a big tree, and then ran back and called the soldiers up. When the soldiers saw the generator submerged in the water, they all scrambled to jump into the water to carry it. But the company commander cherished the soldiers and ordered that they not go into the water casually. He took a few squad leaders, jumped into the water, and carried the generator ashore.

Li Fengxiang not only cared for and cared for the soldiers meticulously, but he also often forgot to eat and sleep when he worked. During the company's bridge construction, he carried sleepers, tied steel bars, and cranked winches with the soldiers. Wherever the task was heavy, he went there. Because the company commander took the lead in labor, the soldiers' enthusiasm became more and more full. They said: Working with the company commander, they didn't feel tired no matter how heavy the work was. Under his leadership, the company completed its tasks ahead of schedule time and time again and was repeatedly commended by the higher-level Party committee.

Li Fengxiang's meticulous care for the soldiers and selfless labor left a deep impression on every soldier. Therefore, everyone calls him "Good Company Commander."

　　发扬革命传统作风
    政委和水兵
    一天，海军某军舰上的水兵们正忙着运煤，人群中，一个身材不高的中年人，穿着一身褪了色的蓝军衣，裤腿卷得老高，满头大汗，提着满满一筐煤，一边跑，一边笑着喊：“小伙子们，加油干呀！”
      “这是谁？”一个新来的战士问。
    “是我们政委嘛！”
    “哦，政委！”新来的战士没有想到，这就是他们的首长闵凡义。他想：“首长们都和我们在一起工作。”于是不由得加起劲来。
    闵凡义政委和水兵一起干活是常事，他处处以自己的模范行动带动他的士兵。舰上大小工作，他不仅具体指导，而且亲自参加。舰靠码头，他帮着拖缆，清洁大舱，他帮着拉锅炉管，而且尽捡重活干。为了保证安全，每次航行，他都不下指挥台，协助舰长处理问题。晚上还照例值更。战士们劝他休息，他说：“这是条令规定，应该遵守。”
    遇到困难和危险，闵政委总是打前阵。一天傍晚，海上刮起六七级大风，上级突然来命令，叫派小艇去执行一件紧急任务。战士听说有紧急任务，个个抢着报名。闵政委看着战士们一张张兴奋的脸，点了点头，然后又向海面望去，黑黝黝的浪头像起伏的山岗，浪头打在舰舷上，溅起的浪花像瀑布似地落了下来，冰凉的海水溅了他一脸。他扭转头来说：“让我去吧！”于是不顾大家劝阻，纵身跳进小艇。战士们站在舰头望着渐渐隐没在浪涛和黑暗中的小舰，心中无限激动。
    闵政委热爱战士，非常关心战士们的进步，他和战士一块劳动、吃饭、学习、娱乐。每天都要到各班去看看，和战士们谈谈，了解每个人的思想、脾气，随时发现问题，随时帮助解决。有一次，他参加枪炮班拖缆，发现有几个战士技术不高，干起活来很费劲。晚上，他就组织战士座谈，结合白天操作总结经验。会上他还向战士介绍了自己的拖缆经验。
    因为闵政委平等待人，关心群众，所以战士们都非常敬爱他，信任他，把他当做知心人，什么事，只要他说一句话，小伙子们就会像猛虎下山一般争先恐后地去干。
          “老八路”作风
    解放军驻新疆部队某部首长贾学义在战斗的年月里，曾经负过七次伤，左臂残废，左目失明。但是，他那种在革命军队熔炉里长期陶冶成长的“老八路”作风，却越来越强。
    他工作在一个运输部门，每天除办公室工作外，总要抽时间到车场、下连队，每个哨兵，只要听到远远传来的脚步声，都可以辨出是首长来了。由于深入群众，战士的工作、生活情况，他都了若指掌，连队每一件新事物都逃不脱他的眼睛。比如他发现部队个别干部有跃进到顶思想，便到车场去了解群众反映，当听到驾驶员黄福义“早出车、晚收车、加强车辆保养多出车”的建议后，立刻和党委研究，把这个建议变为部队的战斗口号，掀起群众运动，大大提高车辆出车率。
    他关心群众更是无微不至，经常利用假日探望分散执勤的战士。去年冬天一个雪夜里，他到三连查铺，看到两个战士蹬开了被子、坦胸露臂地睡着了，他便轻轻地给他们把被子盖好，关了灯。临走时，一再叮咛连的干部多查铺，不要让战士受凉。因为他一只眼睛残废，夜晚出外查铺时很不方便，但是他依然一个夜晚又一个夜晚外出查铺、查哨，看车场。
    多年来，贾学义保持着“老八路”的优良作风，不仅对工作严肃认真，说干就干，今天的事决不拖到明天，而且在生活上一直保持着艰苦朴素的作风。贾学义是当年八路军在南泥湾大生产运动中的生产模范，如今他仍然不失当年劳动模范的本色，部队进行农副业生产，他挥动着一只右臂和战士一起种地；部队炼钢，他又通宵战斗在炉旁。战士们说：首长的旺盛的革命热情和吃苦耐劳的精神，永远是我们学习的榜样。
          战士的好连长
    在铁道兵某工地上，不论是烈日当空，还是大雨倾盆，都可以看到一个身材高大、体魄健壮的干部和战士一块劳动。他就是某部九连的连长李凤祥。
    提起李连长，每个战士都能说出许多感动人心的事情。
    有一天，九连在一个山上爆破，一个新炮手点着了导火索，因为心慌，跑得过急，一只脚夹在石头缝里，跌倒拔不出来。雷管冒着青烟，炮眼看就要响了。这时候，李凤祥毫无畏惧地跑上前去，帮炮手拔出脚来，背着就跑。还没跑出危险区，轰的一声，炮响了，大批石头飞上高空。李凤祥急忙把背着的战士放下来，并且用自己的身体遮挡住他，直到炮响完了，才从泥土中爬起来。
    又一次，九连在修建西洋江大桥。一天夜晚收工以后，突然暴雨倾盆，江水骤然上涨，工地上的发电机被洪水淹没了一半，随时都有被水冲走的危险。这时，李凤祥正好来工地巡视，他看到以后，立刻跳进冰凉的水中，用绳子把发电机绑住拴在一棵大树上，然后跑回去，把战士叫起来。战士们看到淹在水中的发电机，个个争着下水去抬。但是连长爱护士兵，下令不准随便下水，自己带着几个班长，跳下水去，把发电机抬上岸来。
    李凤祥不仅爱护和关怀战士无微不至，他工作起来经常是废寝忘食。在连队架桥施工中，他和战士一起扛枕木，绑钢筋，摇绞车。哪里任务繁重，就到哪里去。由于连长带头劳动，战士们干劲越来越足，他们说：和连长在一起，干再重的活也不觉得累。在他的带动下，连队一次又一次地提前完成任务，多次受到上级党委的表扬。
    李凤祥对战士无微不至的关怀和忘我的劳动给每个战士留下深刻印象，因此，大家称他“好连长”。
