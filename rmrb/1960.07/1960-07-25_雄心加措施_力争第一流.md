　　The news published in this newspaper today about the new improvements in product quality at the Hangzhou Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory, the Shanghai Qingong Paper Mill, and the Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 provides us with a universally significant experience: as long as we continuously improve our leadership style and earnestly take concrete measures, the four requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical can be completely unified, and the quality of light industrial products can generally reach first-class levels.

　　Establishing the idea of quality first and striving to produce more first-class light industrial products is a very important issue. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The superiority of socialism must not only be manifested in the quantity and progress of our economic achievements but also in its quality." Under the socialist system, the interests of industrial enterprises and the interests of consumers are completely consistent. Light industrial products are mostly necessities for the lives of the people. The masses not only demand a certain satisfaction in quantity but also demand good quality, durability, beauty, and elegance. Therefore, producing first-class light industrial products is essentially the responsible attitude that industrial enterprises should have towards the masses and the country. No matter who it is, when they buy something, they hope it will last as long as possible. When people buy fabric to make clothes, they hope it will be strong, durable, and beautiful; when they buy a bicycle, they hope it will be light, agile, and durable. To achieve these goals, the quality of the product must be good, and only by improving the quality can the use value be improved. For example, the Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 produced long rubber shoes. Last year, the lifespan of each pair of shoes was only one hundred and twenty-three days. After the quality was improved this year, it can be worn for two hundred and forty days. In this way, one pair of rubber shoes can be used as two pairs. People who originally needed to wear two pairs of rubber shoes a year now only need one pair. Similarly, from the perspective of the utilization efficiency of raw materials, it has also been brought into greater play. The raw materials used to make one pair of shoes now have the effect of two pairs of shoes. It is very obvious that if the quality of light industrial products can be generally improved, even if the use value is not doubled, but increased by tens of percent, it will be a remarkable achievement.

　　It can be seen that improving the quality of light industrial products and striving to produce more first-class light industrial products is of great significance both politically and economically. So, is it possible to do it? The facts of the Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory, the Qingong Paper Mill, and the Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 have proven that it is entirely possible. The key lies in: first, whether the ambitious goal of striving for first-class has been established; second, whether concrete measures have been taken to improve quality in a practical way. If the leading personnel of the enterprise do not have the ambition to strive for first-class and do not want to work hard to improve, it will be impossible to come up with measures and methods to overcome difficulties and produce first-class products. In this case, even if the employees have the great wisdom and courage to improve quality, it will be difficult to find a place to contribute their wisdom and courage. Therefore, further implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical among all employees of the enterprise, and establishing the idea of striving for first-class product quality, is a prerequisite for ensuring the production of first-class products.

　　But this is only a prerequisite. Having only the ambitious goal of striving for first-class is not enough to produce first-class products. With the ambition to strive for first-class, we must also have concrete measures to strive for first-class. This is what Chairman Mao told us: strategically, we must despise the enemy, and tactically, we must value the enemy. We emphasize that we must establish the ambitious goal of striving for first-class, which is to dare to despise the difficulties inevitably encountered in the process of improving quality. At the same time, we must pay attention to every link in improving quality and take concrete measures in a practical way to solve the problems in each link carefully and meticulously. In this way, striving for first-class product quality will not be empty talk, but will have a solid foundation. Why was the Hangzhou Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory able to jump from the worst quality unit in the city's silk weaving industry to the city's advanced quality unit, and why has the rate of qualified silk products been maintained at 100% from November last year to now? Why was the qualified rate of paper at the Shanghai Qingong Paper Mill only 29% in April this year, but it jumped to 70% in May, and four of the five varieties produced by the factory were rated as first-class high-quality products in the city? This is because they not only made up their minds to strive for first-class, but also did a lot of meticulous and practical work, and took many concrete measures. For example, the Party branch secretary, factory director, and other leading cadres and staff of the Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory went deep into the production site to study the reasons for the poor product quality with the workers and jointly find solutions. They established a unified operating procedure in the factory and improved the raw material work, etc. The reason for the improvement of product quality in these three factories is all due to the fact that the leaders went deep, meticulous, and pragmatic, and solved one specific problem after another. Obviously, without concrete measures to strive for first-class, it is impossible to improve product quality.

　　Poor product quality is often caused by many factors. There are problems with machinery and equipment, problems with production technology, problems with raw materials, and problems with management systems, etc. The key is to find out what the main problems are and how to solve these problems. This requires the leading cadres of the enterprise to go deep into the front line of production to discover problems, eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, and jointly find good solutions, take necessary measures, and establish and improve necessary systems, and solve specific problems practically. In this process, it is especially important to strengthen management work and establish and improve various rational management systems and operating procedures. In addition, strengthening regular equipment maintenance and quality inspection, and strengthening technical training for new workers, etc., all have a significant impact on ensuring the improvement of product quality.

　　The current situation is very favorable for us to improve the quality of light industrial products. The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has created many new experiences and technologies for us to improve product quality. Since the winter and spring of last year, enterprises in many cities across the country have launched a movement to catch up with "famous brand goods," surpass "famous brand goods," and create "famous brand goods," and have also explored many good experiences in improving quality. As long as we establish the idea of striving for quality first, regard the production of first-class light industrial products as a responsible attitude and glorious task to the country and the people, carry forward the style of hard work, seize the key problems in improving quality, and solve them practically one by one, we will be able to produce more first-class light industrial products.

### 雄心加措施  力争第一流

    雄心加措施  力争第一流
    今天本报发表的杭州富强丝织厂、上海勤工造纸厂和青岛橡胶九厂等三个轻工业工厂产品质量提高的新闻，向我们提供了一个具有普遍意义的经验：只要我们不断地改进领导作风，切切实实地采取具体措施，多快好省四个要求是完全可以统一的，轻工业品的质量是可以普遍达到第一流水平的。
    树立质量第一的思想，力争生产出更多的第一流轻工业品，是一个十分重要的问题。刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会政治报告中就曾经指出过：“社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在我们的经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面。”在社会主义制度下，工业企业的利益和消费者的利益是完全一致的。轻工业品大都是人民群众生活的必需品，群众不仅要求在数量上得到一定的满足，而且要求质量要好，经久耐用，美观大方。因此，生产质量第一流的轻工业品，实质上是工业企业对群众、对国家应有的负责观点。不管是谁，他买一样东西，都希望用的时间越长越好。人们买一件做衣服的布料，都希望质地牢固，色泽耐久又美观；买一辆自行车，都希望轻便灵巧，又坚固耐用。要做到这些，产品的质量一定要好，质量提高了，使用价值才能提高。比如，青岛橡胶九厂生产的长球鞋，去年上半年每双鞋的寿命只有一百二十三天，今年上半年质量提高以后，可以穿到二百四十天了。这样，一双胶鞋就可以当两双穿了。原来一年要穿两双胶鞋的人，现在有一双就够了。同样，从原料的利用效能来看，也得到了更高的发挥，原来做一双鞋的原材料，现在发挥了两双鞋的效用。十分明显，如果轻工业品的质量都能普遍提高，即使使用价值不是提高一倍，而是提高百分之几十，那也是一件了不起的大事。
    由此可见，提高轻工业品的质量，力争生产更多的第一流轻工业品，无论在政治上和经济上都是有重大意义的。那末能不能办到呢？富强丝织厂、勤工造纸厂和青岛橡胶九厂的事实已经证明了是完全可以办到的。问题的关键在于：第一，是不是树立了力争第一流的雄心壮志；第二，是不是切切实实地采取各种提高质量的具体措施。如果企业的领导人员心中没有争第一流的大志，不想发愤图强，就不可能想出战胜困难，生产第一流产品的措施和办法。在这种情况下，即使职工群众有提高质量的大智大勇，也难于找到献智献勇的地方。所以说，在企业的全体职工中，进一步贯彻多快好省的方针，树立力争产品质量第一流的思想，是保证生产出第一流产品的先决条件。
    但这只是先决条件。光有力争第一流的雄心壮志这个条件，还是不可能生产出第一流产品的。有了力争第一流的雄心，还要有力争第一流的具体措施。这就是毛主席告诉我们的：在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人。我们强调必须树立力争第一流的雄心壮志，就是要敢于藐视提高质量过程中所必然遇到的困难。同时我们又要重视提高质量的每一个环节，切切实实地采取具体措施，把每一个环节的问题都认真细致地解决。这样，力争产品质量第一流才不是一句空话，才有实实在在的基础。杭州富强丝织厂为什么能从全市丝织业中质量最差的单位一跃而为全市的质量先进单位，从去年11月到现在绸缎的正品率一直保持100％呢？上海勤工造纸厂今年4月份纸张正品率还只有29％，为什么到5月份一跃就达到了70％，全厂生产的五个品种，有四个品种都评成了全市的第一类优质品呢？这就在于他们既下定了力争第一流的决心，又做了许多细致、切实的工作，采取了很多具体措施。比如，富强丝织厂的党支部书记、厂长等领导干部和科室人员，都深入到现场去和工人们一起研究产品质量不高的原因，共谋解决的办法，在全厂建立了统一的操作规程，改进了原料工作等等。分析这三个工厂产品质量提高的缘由，无一不是由于领导深入、细致、踏实，解决了一个个具体问题所致。显然，没有力争第一流的具体措施，要想提高产品质量是不可能的。
    产品质量不高，往往是有着多方面的原因的。有机器设备上的问题，有生产技术上的问题，有原材料的问题，有管理制度等等各方面的问题。究竟什么是主要问题和怎样解决这些问题，这就要求企业的领导干部要深入到生产第一线去发现问题，和工人群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，共同找出解决问题的良策，采取必要的措施，建立和健全必要的制度，把一个个具体问题切实地解决。这中间，加强管理工作，建立和健全各种合理的管理制度和操作规程等尤为重要。此外，加强经常性的设备维修和质量检验工作，加强新工人的技术培训工作等等，对保证产品质量提高都有着重大作用。
    当前的形势对我们提高轻工业品的质量十分有利。技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，给我们创造了许多提高产品质量的新经验、新技术；去冬今春以来，全国许多城市的企业开展了大赶“名牌货”、大超“名牌货”和大创“名牌货”的运动，也摸索出了不少提高质量的好经验。只要我们树立了力争质量第一的思想，把生产第一流的轻工业品看做是对国家对人民应有的负责态度和光荣任务，发扬埋头苦干的作风，抓住提高质量中的关键问题，切切实实地一个个加以解决，就一定能够生产出更多的质量第一流的轻工业品。
