Letter from Cadres Sent to Lower Levels

To the Editor:
　　We are cadres from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Finance who have been sent to lower levels. A year ago, we came to the Lugouqiao People's Commune for labor training with joyful hearts.

　　I remember when we first arrived, it was the season of summer harvest and summer planting. Rain was continuous, ditches and moats were full, and it seemed that the vegetable harvest would be greatly threatened. We joined the commune members in the tense battle of carrying water to prevent flooding and rushing to plant and harvest. We often carried water and protected the dikes until late at night in the rain. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the soaring revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of commune members, we finally overcame the extraordinary flood and achieved a great vegetable harvest. The vegetable output of the Sanluju Brigade, where we are located, reached 72 million catties in 1959, an increase of 11 million catties compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. It is our greatest honor to let the people of the city eat tender and fresh vegetables.

　　Later, we worked with the young commune members to build a 100-mu fish pond from scratch in a month, raising 300,000 fish, which have now grown to be about a catty each.

　　While participating in labor, we also worked with comrades from the Central Ministry of Finance to help the commune establish and improve financial management systems, implement the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, help the commune's financial personnel learn accounting, improve their professional skills, and also help the production team's canteen strengthen management, promote production, reduce expenses, and do everything possible to serve agriculture. With the development of production, the income of our brigade has greatly increased. The total income in 1959 reached 4.4 million yuan, an increase of 44.5% compared to 1958, and public accumulation was 1.09 million yuan, an increase of eight times compared to 1958. The average income per household for commune members was 722 yuan. Such fruitful results give us great encouragement. In the first half of this year, we have achieved brilliant results in production. From January to June, the vegetables on the market reached 23.4 million catties, an increase of 4.32 million catties compared to the same period last year.

　　Although we have done some work in the commune for agricultural development, it is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people and the needs of the sustained leap forward situation. Therefore, we must further resolutely respond to the Party's great call to "first grasp agriculture, agriculture is the foundation." Under the correct leadership of the Party, and under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we will make greater achievements in agricultural production.

专栏：下放干部来信

　　我们决心在农村更好劳动和工作编辑同志：
    我们是北京市财政局的下放干部。一年以前，怀着愉快的心情来到芦沟桥人民公社劳动锻炼。
    记得刚来的时候，正当夏收、夏种的季节。雨水连绵，沟满濠平，眼看蔬菜收获要受到极大威胁。我们就和社员一起，投入了挑水防涝、抢种抢收的紧张战斗。时常冒雨挑水和护堤到深夜。由于党的正确领导，广大社员发挥了冲天革命干劲，终于战胜了特大的涝灾，并且获得蔬菜大丰收。我们所在的三路居大队1959年的蔬菜产量达七千二百万斤，比大跃进的1958年增加一千一百万斤。让城市人民吃到又嫩又鲜的蔬菜，是我们最大的光荣。
    后来我们又和青年社员一起，用一个月时间，从无到有地修起一个百亩大鱼池，养鱼三十万尾，现在鱼已长到斤把重了。
    我们在参加劳动的同时，还和中央财政部的同志一起，帮助公社建立和健全财务管理制度，贯彻勤俭办社的方针；帮助公社财务人员学习会计，提高业务水平；还帮助生产队食堂加强管理，促进生产，减少开支，千方百计为农业服务。随着生产事业的发展，我们大队的收入大大增加，1959年的总收入达四百四十万元，比1958年增加44.5％，公共积累一百零九万元，比1958年增加八倍。社员每户平均收入七百二十二元。这样的丰硕果实，给我们很大鼓舞。今年上半年我们在生产上又获得了辉煌战果，1—6月份上市蔬菜达二千三百四十万斤，比去年同期增长四百三十二万斤。
    我们虽然在公社为农业发展作了些工作，但离党和人民的要求和持续跃进形势的需要还相差很远。因此，我们要进一步坚决响应党的“首先抓农业，农业是基础”的伟大号召。在党的正确领导下，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在农业生产上作出更大的成绩。
