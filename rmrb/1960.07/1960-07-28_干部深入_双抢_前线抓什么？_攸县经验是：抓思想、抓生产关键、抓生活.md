(People's Daily, Changsha, July 27) Leading cadres in You County, Hunan Province, are going deep into the fields to solve various specific problems, accelerate the pace of the "Double 抢" (抢收, qiang shou - "grabbing the harvest", and 抢种, qiang zhong - "grabbing the planting"), and strive to complete the "Double 抢" task five days before the Beginning of Autumn (立秋).

This year, the county's harvesting and transplanting tasks have increased by more than 210,000 mu compared to last year. To accelerate the progress of the "Double 抢", in addition to concentrating more than 80% of the labor force in the fields, the county party committee has dispatched five county committee members, fourteen deputy secretaries of the commune party committees, and more than seventy cadres to strengthen the leadership of some weaker teams. After the cadres went deep into the fields, they found that a few people, seeing the heavy tasks, tight schedule, and hot weather, had developed a fear of difficulty and a slackening mood. In addition to talking about the situation, favorable conditions, and the importance of "Double 抢", the cadres also universally summarized the facts of high yields from early transplanting of late rice last year to educate the commune members. For example, in the Gao Xin team of the Shangyunqiao Commune, more than 300 mu of late rice were all transplanted before the "Great Heat" (大暑), with an average yield of 514 jin per mu. The more than 700 mu of late rice in the Shangpu Production Team were mostly transplanted after the "Great Heat", resulting in a yield of only 406 jin per mu. Through comparative discussions, the commune members further realized the importance of seizing the season.

After the cadres went deep, they also promptly solved the following problems: First, insist on putting the new tools to use. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee went deep into the Dacang Brigade of the Yajiangqiao Commune and found that some new tools had not been used. He immediately decided to establish machine transplanting professional teams at the production team level and rapid rice harvester professional teams at the work group level. In accordance with the spirit of this decision, the entire county organized more than 21,000 skilled workers to use rice transplanters and rice harvesters. Second, rationally organize the labor force. Each work group organized two sets of personnel, one responsible for harvesting and one for transplanting. Tasks were specifically assigned to individuals according to their specialties, and work points were consistently recorded based on quotas. Thanks to the good organization of the labor force, it was truly achieved to harvest one plot, plow one plot, and transplant one plot, with a field of yellow in the morning and a field of green in the evening. Third, organize large-scale competitions and collaborations. A competition was launched throughout the county between communes, teams, groups, and individuals, with everyone chasing each other and striving to be the best, resulting in the emergence of more than 850 high-efficiency units. In accordance with the principle of equal exchange, various localities carried out collaboration, and some brigades transferred more than 14,000 laborers and more than 4,000 head of cattle to support the weaker teams. Fourth, take good care of the commune members' lives and combine work with rest. During the "Double 抢" period, grain rations, cooking oil, and vegetables were appropriately increased. All localities implemented the method of going to work early and finishing work late, resting for two or three hours at noon, and insisted on eight hours of sleep and four hours for meals and rest. In order to reduce the housework burden of female commune members, temporary laundry groups were also established in various canteens. At present, the "Double 抢" movement in this county is entering a climax, the progress of "Double 抢" has been greatly accelerated, and it is expected that the task can be completed five days before the Beginning of Autumn.

    干部深入“双抢”前线抓什么？
    攸县经验是：抓思想、抓生产关键、抓生活
    本报长沙27日电　湖南省攸县领导干部深入田间，解决各项具体问题，加快“双抢”速度，力争立秋前五天完成“双抢”任务。
    这个县今年收插任务比去年增加二十一万多亩。为加快“双抢”进度，除集中80％以上劳力投入田间外，县委特派出了五个县委委员、十四个公社党委副书记以及七十多名干部，加强一部分薄弱队的领导。干部深入田间后，发现有少数人看到任务大、时间紧、天气热，产生了一种畏难松劲情绪。干部除了讲形势，讲有利条件，讲“双抢”的重要性外，并普遍总结了去年晚稻早插高产的事实教育社员。如上云桥公社高新队，去年三百多亩晚稻全部在“大暑”前插完，平均亩产五百一十四斤。上铺生产队七百多亩晚稻，大部分是“大暑”后插的，结果亩产只四百零六斤。通过对比讨论，社员们进一步认识到了抢住季节的重要性。
    干部深入以后，还及时解决了这样几个问题：第一，坚持把新工具用起来。县委第一书记深入丫江桥公社大沧大队，发现有些新工具没有使用起来，即决定以生产队为单位成立机插专业队，以作业组为单位成立使用快速割禾器专业队。全县根据这个决定的精神，共组织了二万一千多能手使用插秧机和割禾器。第二，合理组织劳动力。各作业组组织两套人马，一套负责收，一套负责插。按社员特长具体把任务分到人，坚持按定额评工记分。由于劳动力组织得好，真正做到了收一丘、犁一丘、插一丘，早上一片黄、晚上一片青。第三，组织大竞赛、大协作。全县展开了社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人之间的竞赛，你追我赶，涌现出高工效单位八百五十多个。各地按照等价交换的原则，开展了协作，一部分大队抽调出一万四千多劳力和四千多头耕牛，支援了力量较弱的队。第四，搞好社员生活和劳逸结合。“双抢”期间，适当增加了口粮、食油、蔬菜。各地都实行了早出工、晚收工，中午休息两、三小时的办法，坚持睡眠八小时，吃饭休息四小时。为了减少女社员的家务劳动，各个食堂还成立了临时洗衣组。目前，这个县的“双抢”运动正进入高潮，“双抢”进度大大加快，预计立秋前五天可以完成任务。
