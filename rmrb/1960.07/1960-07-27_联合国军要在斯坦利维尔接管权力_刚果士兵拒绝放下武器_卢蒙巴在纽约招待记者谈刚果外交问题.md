Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Leopoldville News: In Stanleyville, the capital of Congo's Orientale Province, Congolese soldiers who bravely resisted the Belgian invading forces and disarmed the colonialists have refused to lay down their arms to the UN forces.

The first batch of UN forces, commanded by UN Under-Secretary-General, the American Ralph Bunche, and European officers, was dispatched to Stanleyville on the 17th. A UN spokesman admitted on the 25th that the Congolese army there refused to hand over their weapons. The Associated Press, in a news dispatch, said that the UN's approach was to allow the Congolese to "peacefully transfer their power to others" and then begin "training" the Congolese army. The report stated, however, that the UN forces "have not been able to persuade the Congolese soldiers to lay down their arms." It also stated that, so far, this approach by the UN forces "is not working" in Stanleyville.

It is reported that the UN forces are also planning to send more troops to Stanleyville. The number of UN forces that have arrived and are distributed in various parts of the Congo has already approached 7,500, and by the 27th, the number will increase to 9,000.

It was also announced that retired US General Wheeler has arrived in the Congo. He will operate in various parts of the Congo under the pretext of "helping with oil transportation work in Matadi port" and "solving inland transportation problems in the Congo."

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: New York News: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba reiterated at a press conference held at the UN headquarters last night that Belgian troops must withdraw from the Congo.

Lumumba said that the Congolese government wants the Belgian government to withdraw its troops from the Congo, including the military bases granted to Belgium in a "treaty of friendship" between Belgium and the Congo that has not yet been ratified. Lumumba said that this treaty has been violated and broken by Belgium. Therefore, "this treaty no longer has any legal or practical value." Lumumba emphasized that Belgian troops must withdraw from the entire Congo immediately.

He expressed his hope that UN forces would remain in the Congo after the withdrawal of Belgian troops to restore order and help train the Congolese army. He said that when these goals are achieved, he will request the withdrawal of the UN forces.

The Congolese Prime Minister condemned the conspiracy of foreign countries to create the "independence" of Katanga Province to split the Congo. He said, "Our people are determined to defend our territorial integrity." When Lumumba spoke of the Congolese army's struggle against the Belgian colonialists, he said, "The events that occurred in the Congo are not the result of hatred of white people," this is "a localized incident in the army, not a universal movement among the Congolese people."

Lumumba said at the press conference that the sole aim of the Congolese people is to establish a free and independent country. He also said that his country will pursue a policy of "active neutrality," "we are not against anyone." He said that Africa "is not against the United States, nor is it against the Soviet Union." He also said, "We do not want to fall from colonialism into dictatorship. We want to establish a democratic system like the United States."

Lumumba told reporters that during his stay in the United States, he would visit Washington and meet with Eisenhower.

In response to the statement by American capitalist Detwiler that his company—Congo International Management Corporation—had signed a 50-year contract with the Congolese government to implement a plan to "develop" the Congo, Lumumba said, "There is no final agreement yet, because the parliament must study this plan." He said that the Congolese government only took "exploratory" actions, "only after a ministerial committee meets to study it can a final decision be made on it."

    联合国军要在斯坦利维尔接管权力
    刚果士兵拒绝放下武器
    卢蒙巴在纽约招待记者谈刚果外交问题
    据新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果东方省首府斯坦利维尔，曾经英勇抗击比利时侵略军并解除了殖民者武装的刚果士兵，拒绝向联合国军放下武器。
    由联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇和欧洲军官指挥的联合国军的第一批部队是17日被派往斯坦利维尔的。联合国发言人25日承认，那里的刚果军队拒绝交出武器。美联社在一则消息中说，联合国的作法是使刚果人“和平地把他们的权力交给别人”，然后开始“训练”刚果军队。消息说，但是联合国军“没有能够说服刚果士兵放下武器”。它还说，截至目前，联合国军的这种作法在斯坦利维尔“行不通”。
    据报道，联合国军还打算派更多的部队到斯坦利维尔去。目前到达和分布在刚果各地的联合国军人数已经接近七千五百名，到27日，数目将增加到九千人。
    同时据宣布，美国退休将军惠勒已到达刚果。他将以“帮助马塔迪港的石油运输工作”和“解决刚果内陆交通问题”的名义到刚果各处活动。
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴昨天晚上在联合国总部举行的记者招待会上，重申比利时军队必须撤出刚果。
    卢蒙巴说，刚果政府希望比利时政府从刚果撤出它的军队，包括在一项尚未批准的比利时同刚果的“友好条约”中给予比利时的军事基地在内。卢蒙巴说，这项条约已经遭到比利时的违犯和破坏。因此，“这项条约已经不再有什么法律上的和实际的价值”。卢蒙巴强调，比利时军队必须立即从整个刚果撤出。
    他表示，他希望联合国军队在比利时军队撤退以后留在刚果，以恢复秩序和帮助训练刚果军队。他说，当这些目标达到以后，他将要求撤退联合国军队。
    这位刚果总理谴责外国制造加丹加省“独立”以分裂刚果的阴谋。他说，“我们的人民决心保卫我们的领土完整。”卢蒙巴谈到刚果军队反对比利时殖民者的斗争时说，“在刚果发生的事件不是由于仇恨白人的结果”，这是“军队中的一种局部性事件，而不是刚果人民中的一种普遍的运动”。　　卢蒙巴在记者招待会上说，刚果人的唯一目的是建立一个自由独立的国家。他还说，他的国家将执行“积极中立”的政策，“我们不反对任何人”。他说，非洲“不反对美国，也不反对苏联”。他又说，“我们不希望从殖民主义陷入独裁政治。我们希望建立一个像美国这样的民主制度。”
    卢蒙巴告诉记者们说，在他逗留美国期间，他将要访问华盛顿，并且去会见艾森豪威尔。
    在谈到美国资本家德特威勒所说的他的公司——刚果国际管理公司——已经同刚果政府签订了一个五十年的合同来执行一个“开发”刚果的计划，卢蒙巴说：“还没有最后协议，因为议会必须研究这个计划。”他说，刚果政府只采取了“探索”的行动，“只有在一个部长级委员会开会进行研究之后，才能对它作出最后的决定。”
