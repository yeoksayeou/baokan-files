　　Boiling Seawater Exceeds Zhang Yu, Transformations Surpass Sun Wukong

　　Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has broken out of the cotton circle and widely launched a "small indigenous groups" movement for comprehensive utilization and diversified operations. The chemical products they successfully trial-produced, as well as the comprehensive utilization of degummed waste liquid from wild fibers and seawater, have produced more than thirty kinds of products. Seventeen kinds have already been put into production, mainly including metallic sodium, silica, mirabilite, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia. To produce the above products, more than 100 various large and small indigenous furnaces have been built. The chemical products put into production are now on par with yarn and cloth products and are included in the enterprise's production plan.

　　In order to rush to build the small indigenous furnaces, the workers searched every corner of the factory for broken bricks and dismantled waste walls, and looked for scrap steel, iron scraps, and old iron wires in the waste material warehouse. Eighteen indigenous hydrochloric acid reaction furnaces were built overnight. Various departments have also established their own production bases. They use small iron buckets and small basins and jars to produce products with high output and good quality. The calcium chloride produced by the Supply and Marketing Section has a daily output of two to three hundred kilograms. The ammonia produced by the Guard Team has a purity of over 25 degrees. Everyone has a great determination for comprehensive utilization and diversified operations. The female workers said, "Although we are not Zhang Yu, we will make a name for ourselves by boiling seawater!" "We can transform even better than Sun Wukong, and the things we transform are both good and valuable!" (Deng Shan, Ping Maolu)

　　大煮海水胜张羽  千变万化赛悟空
    青岛国棉一厂跳出棉花圈子，广泛开展了综合利用、多种经营的“小土群”运动，他们试制成功的化工产品，以及用野生纤维脱胶的废液和海水等综合利用，生产了三十多种产品，已经投入生产的有十七种，主要有金属钠、二氧化硅、芒硝、氯化钙、硫酸亚铁、盐酸、氨水等。为了生产上述产品，建起的各种大、小土炉一百多座，投入生产的化工产品已和纱、布产品并驾齐驱，列入企业的生产计划。
    工人为了抢建小土炉，在全厂每个角落搜罗碎砖和拆掉废墙壁，到废料库找废钢碎铁旧铁丝，十八个土制盐酸的反应炉，一夜之间就砌成了。各科室也建立了自己的生产基地。他们使用小铁桶和小盆小罐，生产出产量高、质量好的产品。供销科生产的氯化钙，日产二、三百公斤。警卫队生产的氨水，纯度达到二十五度以上。大家对综合利用和多种经营的决心很大，女工们说：“我们虽然不是张羽，可要把海水煮个名堂！”“我们比孙悟空还会变，变出的东西又好又值钱！”　（邓山、平茅芦）
