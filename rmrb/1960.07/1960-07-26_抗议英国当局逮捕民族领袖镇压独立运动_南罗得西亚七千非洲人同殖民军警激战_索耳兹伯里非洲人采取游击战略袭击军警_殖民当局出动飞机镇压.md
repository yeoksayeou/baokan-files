Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Bulawayo Dispatch: The struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia against the rule of the British colonialists has expanded from Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, to Bulawayo, a commercial and industrial center 230 miles southwest of the city. On the 24th, 7,000 African demonstrators in an African township on the outskirts of Bulawayo shouted "Freedom" and engaged in fierce fighting with 500 colonial military police who came to suppress them.

On the morning of the 24th, members of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, disregarding the British colonial authorities' announcement the previous day banning African gatherings, held a protest rally in this African township on the outskirts of Bulawayo. To suppress the rising anti-colonialist struggle in Southern Rhodesia, the British colonial authorities recently arrested a number of leaders and members of the National Democratic Party. In recent days, the people of Southern Rhodesia have risen up to demonstrate, protesting this act of violence by the colonial authorities.

The colonial military police used batons and tear gas to suppress the rally on the 24th. This further aroused the anger of the demonstrators. The demonstrators formed many teams of 150 to 200 people and stood by the side of the road leading to the city, violently throwing stones at all colonial military police entering the African township. African demonstrators in the northern end of downtown Bulawayo also began throwing stones at the colonizers on the main streets and roads. To strengthen the suppression, the British colonial authorities announced on the evening of the 24th that they had mobilized the colonial military "Second Battalion of the Royal Rhodesian Regiment" to support the police in the Bulawayo area, and ordered some police reserve personnel to stand by. It is reported that on the same night, two companies of colonial troops had entered the location of the demonstration on the outskirts of Bulawayo.

The chairman of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, Mawema, said at a rally of 1,200 people in the African township of Gwelo last night that his party pursues a policy of non-violence, but "unless the immigrant government makes concessions to the Africans of Southern Rhodesia, there will be no peace in this country." He said that Africans must have the right to vote, Europeans must treat Africans equally, and Africans who are currently unemployed must be employed. At this rally, Africans shouted "Freedom now."

The British colonial authorities arrested Mawema and two other leaders of the National Democratic Party on the 19th on the pretext of violating the "Illegal Organizations Act." Amidst the strong demands of the people of Southern Rhodesia for the release of the arrested, they were finally released on bail.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Salisbury Dispatch: The people of Southern Rhodesia, angered by the British colonial authorities' arrest of leaders of the National Democratic Party, continued to fight back against the colonial military police's frenzied suppression on the 21st. In the suburbs of Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, Africans adopted guerrilla tactics, attacking the police and colonizers with stones from all directions.

Last night, in the Harare African township near Salisbury, African demonstrators engaged in a fierce battle with police who came to suppress them. Demonstrators set up roadblocks in the streets, threw stones at the police, and overturned the colonizers' cars. Hundreds of colonial military police attacked the demonstrators with batons and tear gas. At the same time, the colonial authorities also dispatched aircraft to fly low in the sky, releasing tear gas at groups of Africans throwing stones.

It is reported that all police reserves in Salisbury have been called up to carry out suppression tasks immediately. The colonizers are rushing to buy guns.

Earlier on the 21st, demonstrations by Africans also continued in the Hatfield commercial district on the outskirts of Salisbury. The police used batons and tear gas to suppress the demonstrations.

A spokesman for the colonial police authorities said today that 180 Africans have been arrested since the demonstrations broke out on Wednesday. It is reported that those arrested include the vice-chairman of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, Malianga, and the secretary, Nkara.

According to news from London, the British "Worker's Daily" strongly condemned the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia. The newspaper pointed out that the colonial authorities took this action in order to suppress the struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia for equality, suffrage, and an increase in the number of African seats in the Legislative Assembly. The newspaper went on to say that, as happened in Kenya, the purpose of this behavior by the colonial authorities is to maintain the rule of the colonizers and keep Africans under their feet.

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, TASS London Dispatch: Joshua Nkomo, a member of the Executive Committee of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, held a press conference in London on the 24th. After recounting the development of the liberation movement in the country, he said that the government of Southern Rhodesia, headed by Whitehead, is attacking Africans. It injured three Africans in the Highfield area, including a mother with a child.

Nkomo pointed out that the constitution "bestowed" on the country by Britain should be abolished, and the Whitehead government must step down. Nkomo said that the Whitehead government frequently planned attacks on the offices and residences of the leaders of the National Democratic Party. Since July 19, the British authorities have arrested 180 members of the National Democratic Party, including its chairman, Mawema. Nkomo concluded by saying that the British government should be held responsible for creating domestic chaos and disorder.

    抗议英国当局逮捕民族领袖镇压独立运动
    南罗得西亚七千非洲人同殖民军警激战
    索耳兹伯里非洲人采取游击战略袭击军警　殖民当局出动飞机镇压
    新华社25日讯　布拉瓦约消息：南罗得西亚人民反对英国殖民者的统治的斗争已经从南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里扩大到距离这个城市西南二百三十英里的工商业中心布拉瓦约城。24日，布拉瓦约城郊的一个非洲人市镇七千名非洲示威者高呼“自由”，并且同前来镇压的五百名殖民军警展开激烈的战斗。
    24日清晨，南罗得西亚民族民主党的党员，不顾英国殖民当局在前一天宣布禁止非洲人集会，在布拉瓦约城郊的这个非洲人市镇举行抗议集会。英国殖民当局为了镇压南罗得西亚日益高涨的反殖民主义斗争最近曾经大批逮捕民族民主党的领袖和党员。连日来南罗得西亚人民奋起示威，抗议殖民当局的这种暴行。
    殖民军警在镇压24日的集会时使用了警棍和催泪弹。这更加激起了示威者的愤怒情绪。示威者结成许多一百五十人到二百人的队伍，站在通往城市的大路边，猛烈地向所有进入这个非洲人市镇的殖民军警丢石块。布拉瓦约城中心北端的非洲示威者也开始在主要街道和马路上向殖民者扔石块。为了加强镇压，英国殖民当局24日晚上宣布，已经动员殖民军“皇家罗得西亚团第二营”前往支援布拉瓦约地区的警察，并且下令某些警察后备队的人员待命。据报道，当天晚上，两连殖民军已经开入布拉瓦约城郊的示威爆发地点。
    南罗得西亚民族民主党主席玛韦马昨晚在格维洛非洲人市镇一千二百人的集会上说，他的党执行非暴力政策，但是，“除非移民政府向南罗得西亚的非洲人让步，否则这个国家不会有和平。”他说，非洲人必须有投票权，欧洲人必须把非洲人平等看待，目前失业的非洲人必须就业。在这次集会上，非洲人高呼“现在就要自由”。
    英国殖民当局在19日曾经以违反“非法组织法案”为借口逮捕了玛韦马和民族民主党其他两位领袖。在南罗得西亚人民强烈要求释放被捕者的声中，他们终于交保获释。
    新华社22日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：对于英国殖民当局逮捕民族民主党领袖感到愤怒的南罗得西亚人民21日继续反击殖民军警的疯狂镇压。在南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里郊区，非洲人采取了游击战略，在四面八方用石块袭击警察和殖民者。
    昨晚，在索耳兹伯里近郊的哈拉尔非洲人市镇，非洲示威者同前往镇压的警察发生了激烈的斗争。示威者在街上设立路障，向警察投掷石块，并且推翻殖民者的汽车。数以百计的殖民军警察用警棍和催泪弹攻击示威者。同时，殖民当局还出动了飞机在天上低空飞行，向一群群丢石块的非洲人放催泪瓦斯。
    据报道，索耳兹伯里所有的警察后备队都被征召去立即执行镇压任务。殖民者慌忙购买枪枝。
    21日早些时候，在索耳兹伯里郊区海菲耳德商业区也不断发生非洲人的示威行动。警察在镇压示威中使用了警棍和催泪弹。
    殖民警察当局的发言人今天说，自从星期三爆发示威以来，已有一百八十个非洲人被捕。据报道，在被捕者当中包括南罗得西亚民族民主党副主席马利安加和书记恩卡拉。
    据来自伦敦的消息说，英国“工人日报”强烈谴责英国殖民当局在南罗得西亚的暴行。这家报纸指出，殖民当局采取这种行动是为了压制南罗得西亚人民为得到平等、选举权和增加在立法议会中的非洲人席位而进行的斗争。报纸接着说，正像在怯尼亚所发生的一样，殖民当局的这种行为目的在于维持殖民者的统治和把非洲人踩在脚下。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：南罗得西亚民族民主党执行委员会委员乔舒阿·恩科莫24日在伦敦举行记者招待会。他讲述了这个国家解放运动的发展情况以后说，以怀特赫德为首的南罗得西亚政府正在向非洲人进攻。它在海菲耳德地区打伤了三名非洲人，其中有一个带孩子的母亲。
    恩科莫指出，英国“赐与”这个国家的宪法应该停止了，怀特赫德政府必须下台。恩科莫说，怀特赫德政府经常策划袭击民族民主党领导人的办公厅和住宅。自7月19日以来，英国当局逮捕了一百八十名民族民主党党员，其中包括它的主席玛韦马。恩科莫最后说，造成国内混乱和无秩序的责任应由英国政府来负。
