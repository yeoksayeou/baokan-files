    Busy Summer Harvest at the Foot of the Liupan Mountains
    Guyuan County Begins Harvesting Winter Wheat
    (Our Newspaper) News: From the Liupan Mountains to the banks of the Qingshui River in Guyuan County, Ningxia, a scene of abundant harvest unfolds. Spring wheat is currently in the grain-filling stage, while winter wheat has already ripened, and from the plains to the mountains, the vast number of commune members are mutually sharing news of the bumper harvest. In late June, nine communes including Chengyang, Mengyuan, Caomiao, Gucheng, Fengzhuang, Xiji, Hechuan, Sanying, and Qiying, have successively begun harvesting winter wheat.
    This year, in the process of planting winter wheat, Guyuan County implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," prioritizing both high-yield and increased acreage. The sown area was greatly expanded compared to last year, and every possible effort was made to strengthen field management from planting to harvest. Therefore, this year's winter wheat has large ears and plump grains. In order to ensure a bountiful harvest, the Guyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership and fully prepared for the harvest before it began. The County Committee divided the communes into four zones according to their geographical location, with four secretaries from the County Committee Secretariat stationed in each zone. More than one hundred cadres were also drawn from county-level organs to form work groups and assist the work in each commune.

    六盘山下夏收忙
    固原县开镰收割冬麦
    本报讯　宁夏固原县从六盘山到清水河两岸，一片丰收景象。春麦正在灌浆，冬麦已经黄熟，从川到山，广大社员互传丰收喜讯。6月下旬，城阳、孟塬、草庙、古城、冯庄、新集、河川、三营、七营等九个公社，已陆续开始收割冬麦。
    固原县今年在种植冬麦过程中，贯彻了高产多收和多种多收两条腿走路的方针，播种面积比去年扩大了很多，从种到收千方百计加强了田间管理，因此今年冬麦穗大粒饱。为保证丰产丰收，在开镰前，中共固原县委加强了领导，充分进行了收割准备工作。县委将各公社，按地区分成四个片，由县委书记处四名书记驻片，并从县级机关抽调了一百多名干部，组成工作组，到各社协助工作。
