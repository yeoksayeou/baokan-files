Short Commentary:

    Transportation potential exists everywhere, and launching a mass road construction and maintenance campaign is a huge source of untapped potential.
    Some people think: road construction will take up labor, won't that affect production? Indeed, road construction does require some labor, so it is necessary to ensure the labor needed for agricultural production first, then arrange labor reasonably in a unified manner, and do not let road construction affect agricultural production. But road construction and production should not be seen as contradictory. Dongjiao People's Commune in Wenchang County, Guangdong Province, is a coconut-producing area. In the past, due to insufficient roads and poor road conditions, 300,000 coconuts were stockpiled in 1957 and all rotted, resulting in a great loss. Since the Great Leap Forward, roads have been greatly repaired, achieving road access for every team and major roads for every village. More than 1,000 ox carts were organized for transportation, and products were transported in a timely manner, saving a lot of labor for agricultural production. It can be seen that although road construction temporarily takes up some labor, after the roads are repaired, using vehicles for transportation will free a large number of laborers used for manual carrying, which not only does not affect production, but also promotes the development of production. China has a vast territory, but the density of existing highways is very small, and some remote county towns are still not accessible by highways. Therefore, all regions should combine their specific circumstances, reasonably arrange labor during the gaps after spring plowing, before summer weeding, after hoeing, before autumn harvest, and after the autumn harvest, and launch a mass road construction movement. This is not only related to the completion of the current transportation tasks and the exploitation of transportation potential, but also prepares the conditions for the mechanization of agricultural production.
    We must not only build roads, but also maintain them. In a sense, road maintenance is even more important than road construction. Road construction and road maintenance are two aspects of the same thing. Building without maintaining is like building for nothing. Because roads are worn down by vehicles and eroded by rain, if defects are not eliminated in time, they will soon be damaged, affecting transportation, and even making roads unusable, resulting in waste of manpower, materials and financial resources. Under normal circumstances, on a flat and solid highway, a fully loaded truck can travel at 50 to 60 kilometers per hour, but on a bumpy, soft and muddy road, it can only travel at about 20 kilometers, with an efficiency difference of one to two times. The transportation department of Fujian Province calculated that as a result of strengthening road maintenance in 1959, the average speed of vehicles increased by 12.5% to 20%, which is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of more than 400 vehicles. Not only that, but the quality of road maintenance has a great impact on the consumption of tires, fuel and machinery. Compared with good roads and bad roads, the difference is generally 20% to 50%. Therefore, maintaining roads well means providing the country with a large amount of transportation capacity and saving a large amount of gasoline, tires and auto parts.
    It is absolutely necessary to use the gaps between farm work, seize every opportunity, properly arrange labor, and draw out a portion of the labor force to build roads. On the other hand, it is also essential to actively carry out the "six modernizations" movement in road maintenance after road construction. If the transportation departments rely on the masses to do these tasks in a down-to-earth manner, they will surely promote the further improvement of transportation efficiency.

### 抓紧空隙修路养路

    抓紧空隙修路养路
    运输的潜力到处都有，开展群众性的道路建设和公路养护，就是一个巨大的潜力。
    有人以为：修路要占用劳动力，这不是影响生产了么？确实，修路是要占用一些劳动力的，因此必须在首先保证农业生产所需要的劳动力下，统一地合理地安排劳动力，不要让修路影响了农业生产。但也不可把修路和生产对立起来看。广东省文昌县东郊人民公社是一个产椰子的地区，过去因为道路不足，路况不好，1957年积压了三十万只椰子，全部腐烂，损失很大。大跃进以来大修道路，实现了队队通公路，村村有大道，组织了一千多辆牛车搞运输，产品及时运出来了，还节约了很多劳动力投入了农业生产。可见，修建道路虽然一时占用了一些劳动力，但在道路修好以后，改用车子运输，就能把大批的用于运输的劳动力从肩挑背负中解放出来，不但不影响生产，还促进了生产的发展。我国幅员辽阔，而现有公路的密度却很小，有一些偏僻的县城至今尚不通公路。因此，各地要结合本地区的具体情况，在春耕后、夏锄前、挂锄后、秋收前和秋收结束后的空隙，合理安排劳动力，掀起群众性的筑路运动，这不仅关系到当前运输任务的完成，挖掘了运输的潜力，也为农业生产机械化准备了条件。
    我们不仅要修路，还要养路。在一定意义上，养路比修路还重要。修路和养路是一个事物的两个方面。修了不养，等于白修。因为道路经过车辆的磨损，雨水的冲刷，如不及时消除缺点，很快就会损坏，影响运输，甚至有路而不能用，造成人力、物力和财力的浪费。一般情况下，在一条平坦、坚实的公路上，满载货物的汽车，每小时可以跑五、六十公里，但在一条坑洼不平、松软泥泞的公路上，却只能跑二十公里左右，效率相差一至两倍，福建省交通部门算了一笔账，他们在1959年由于加强道路养护的结果，把汽车行驶速度平均提高了12.5％到20％，相当于增加四百多辆汽车的运输能力。不仅如此，道路养得好不好，对于轮胎、油料和机械的消耗影响很大。好路与坏路相比，一般相差20％到50％。所以说，养好道路，就意味着为国家提供了大批运力，节约了大量的汽油、轮胎和汽车配件。
    利用农事间隙，见缝插针，妥善安排劳动力，抽出一部分劳动力来修建道路，这是完全必要的。另一方面，在修路之后积极开展养路“六化”运动，也是必不可少的工作。交通部门依靠群众扎扎实实地做好这些工作，就一定能促进运输效率的进一步提高。
