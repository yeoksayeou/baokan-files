Our New Study Room

　　Recently, our factory's single dormitory implemented "hotel-ization." People say that our "workshop is the battlefield, and the dormitory is the study room," which is not an exaggeration. After "hotel-ization," the eight workers in our Room 18 gave their "study room" names like "New Youth" and "East Wind," determined to study. In the room, we put two desks in the center. When we get off work, the desks are neatly arranged with teacups, and steam rises from the opened thermos. Our clothes and socks are clean. All of this is the result of the hard work of the service staff. Facing this environment, what else do we want to do? So, we decided to study from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM after work, studying Chairman Mao's works, learning technology, and learning culture. Not long ago, we studied the article "How Should Marxists View New Things" published in the People's Daily. After asking each other questions, sharing experiences, taking notes, and engaging in heated discussions, we gained a lot. When the factory launched the high-quality, high-yield campaign, we also wrote papers, arguing that "the relationship between quality and quantity is a dialectical unity," and so on. Now, almost everyone has written more than ten study心得 [xīn dé, insights gained from study] and papers. Take myself as an example. After studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," I have also gained a lot. Some time ago, the factory received a batch of production folding tasks. At that time, my master and I focused on solving the main contradiction of the large number of tasks and low production efficiency. Finally, we came up with some tricks to increase production efficiency by more than thirty times.

　　I often think that the atmosphere of everyone studying theory is so strong, and the "hotel-ization" of the dormitory has played a significant role in promoting it. We sincerely thank the service staff for creating favorable conditions for our workers' production and study.

　　我们的新书房
    最近，我们厂的独身宿舍实行了“旅馆化”，人们都说咱们的“车间是战场，宿舍是书房”，一点也不夸张。咱们十八号房间的八个工人打“旅馆化”后，就给自己的“书房”起了“新青年”和“东风”等名字，立志读书。房间里，我们把两张书桌摆在正中央，下班回来，桌上整齐地摆着茶杯，揭开热水瓶的盖子直冒气，衣服鞋袜干干净净。这一切都是服务员辛勤劳动的结果。面对这一个环境，还想做些什么呢？于是我们决定了下班后七点到九点学习，学毛主席著作，学技术、学文化。不久前，我们学习了人民日报刊登的《马克思主义者应当如何看待新生事物》的文章，经过相互提问题、谈体会，作笔记，并开展热烈的讨论，收获很大。当工厂开展优质高产运动时，我们还写出了论文，论证“质和量的关系是辩证的统一”等等。现在我们几乎每人都写了十篇以上的学习心得和论文。就拿我自己来说，学习毛主席的《矛盾论》后，收获也不小。前些日子厂里来了一批生产折页的任务。当时我和老师傅针对这项任务数量大，生产效率低的主要矛盾狠抓解决这一矛盾的办法，终于想出一些门道，提高生产效率三十倍以上。
    我常想，大家学习理论的空气这样浓厚，宿舍“旅馆化”起了很大的促进作用，我们要真挚地感谢服务员同志，他们为咱们工人的生产和学习创造了有利条件。
