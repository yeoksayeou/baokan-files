Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 8th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, having just returned to New Delhi from the Sino-Indian border region of Ladakh on July 7th, delivered a radio address to the nation that evening. He vehemently attacked the general strike of 2.2 million central government employees, scheduled to begin at midnight on July 11th, and demanded its cancellation.

According to the Press Trust of India, Nehru specifically mentioned the "border issue" when discussing the general strike. He said, "A general strike is tantamount to undermining the efforts of the entire nation, especially at a time when India is facing serious problems on the border." He said, "When the future of this country (India) and its very survival are in danger," there are no issues in dispute.

Nehru attacked the general strike as "irresponsible, inappropriate, and anti-national," and "out of step with the times." He also said that the strike would only embolden "destructive forces" within India. He said, "Let us adopt other peaceful means of consultation to resolve such problems that may arise." However, in his speech, Nehru still refused to meet the government employees' demands for improved living conditions.

    尼赫鲁借口所谓“边界问题”
    要求取消政府雇员总罢工
    新华社8日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁7日刚刚从拉达克的中印边境地区回到新德里，当天晚上就在全印广播电台向全国人民发表广播讲话，激烈地攻击预定从7月11日午夜开始的二百二十万中央政府雇员总罢工，并且要求取消这次总罢工。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼赫鲁谈论总罢工问题时特别提到了
  “边界问题”。他说，“总罢工等于破坏全国人民的努力，尤其是现在印度在边界上面临着严重问题的这个时候”。他说，“当这个国家（印度）的前途和它的生存本身发生危险的时候”，就不存在什么争议的问题。
    尼赫鲁攻击总罢工是“不负责的、不适宜的和反民族的”，“不符合时代精神的”。他并且说，罢工只会纵容印度国内的“破坏力量”。他说，“让我们采取其他和平磋商的方法来解决可能产生的这类问题”。但是，尼赫鲁在讲话中仍然拒绝政府雇员所提出的改善生活的要求。
