    Latin American People Stand Shoulder to Shoulder with Cuba Against U.S. Imperialism
    Cuban Metallurgical Workers Congress Passes Resolution Supporting the Anti-U.S. Struggle of the Latin American People
    Brazilian "New Orientation" Weekly Points Out that the Spearhead of U.S. Aggression Against Cuba is Also Aimed at the Latin American People
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 4th: The recently concluded National Congress of Cuban Metallurgical Workers passed a resolution expressing unconditional support for all necessary measures taken by the Cuban revolutionary government to oppose U.S. economic aggression and defend the motherland and the national economy.
    The Congress also passed a resolution expressing support for the struggles of the people of Latin American countries to break free from the control of U.S. imperialism and to achieve national independence, and paying tribute to the people of Japan and South Korea for their achievements in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 4th: Carlos Olivares, Deputy Secretary for Foreign Relations of the Cuban "July 26th Movement," said yesterday in the "People's University Lecture" broadcast on Havana television and radio that imperialism is a common threat to Latin America. He said that the anti-imperialist consciousness of the Latin American people is constantly increasing. He said that this anti-imperialist consciousness is not caused by accidental reasons, but has its solid foundation. This foundation is the economic, social, and political reality created by the huge U.S. financial interest groups for all Latin American people. He called on the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries to strengthen their unity and oppose the imperialism that oppressed Cuba in the past and continues to oppress the people of Latin American countries today.
    He added that the Cuban revolution has received the militant and active support of the people of Latin American countries because the people of Latin American countries have a common task.
    This newspaper provides a comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Latin American public has widely condemned the U.S. aggressive plots against Cuba and supported the just struggle of the Cuban people.
    The Argentine Committee in Support of the Cuban Revolution adopted a statement at its recent plenary meeting condemning imperialist aggression against Cuba. The statement also congratulated the Cuban people on their achievements in advancing the revolution, especially in land reform. The meeting decided to hold the first national congress to launch a nationwide movement in support of the Cuban revolution. Before the national congress is held, conferences will be held in various provinces, and activities to promote the achievements of the Cuban revolution will be launched.
    People from all walks of life in Brazil support Cuba's takeover of U.S. oil companies. Umberto Meneses, chairman of the National Federation of Bank Employees, said that the takeover was carried out under the just reason of safeguarding Cuban sovereignty. General Felicissimo Cardoso, chairman of the Council for Investigation and Protection of Petroleum, told a reporter from the Latin American News Agency that the Fidel Castro government was right to take over foreign oil companies. Former Sao Paulo State Congressman General Leonidas Cardoso believes that Cuba's takeover of foreign oil refineries is a matter of economic liberation and political sovereignty. He said that Cuba still has many struggles to carry out, and Cuba is currently doing so bravely. General Horta Mendoza, the first chairman of the Brazilian National Petroleum Council, said, "I cannot help but applaud the attitude taken by Cuba in safeguarding its national interests." General Arturo Carlnauba also believes that the Cuban government's takeover of foreign oil companies is a practice to safeguard its own national interests. These generals who made statements actively participated in the movement to nationalize Brazilian oil that was launched in Brazil in 1953.
    The latest issue of the Brazilian weekly "New Orientation" published a commentary on the measures taken by the U.S. government to carry out armed intervention and economic aggression against Cuba, saying: "The war that U.S. imperialism is preparing to launch against Cuba is not only aimed at the Castro government, but also at the Latin American economic and political liberation movement and at the independence and democracy of the people of Latin American countries."
    The weekly pointed out that the goals of U.S. economic aggression against Cuba are mainly concentrated in sugar and oil. The weekly said: "For Brazilians, this kind of blackmail is easy to understand, because the United States has adopted the same aggressive policy towards Brazil."

    拉丁美洲人民和古巴同舟共济反对美帝
    古巴冶金工人代表大会通过决议支持拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争
    巴西“新方针”周刊指出美国侵略古巴矛头也指向拉丁美洲人民
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　最近闭幕的古巴冶金工人全国代表大会通过决议，表示无条件地支持古巴革命政府为反对美国经济侵略以及保卫祖国和民族经济而采取的一切必要措施。
    代表大会还通过决议，表示支持拉丁美洲各国人民为争取摆脱美帝国主义的控制和为取得民族独立而进行的斗争，并且向在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中取得成就的日本人民和南朝鲜人民致敬。
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　古巴“7月26日运动”对外关系副书记卡洛斯·奥利瓦雷斯昨天在哈瓦那电视台和电台广播的“人民大学讲座”中说，帝国主义是拉丁美洲的共同威胁。他说，在拉丁美洲人民的反帝觉悟正在不断提高。他说，这种反帝的觉悟不是由于偶然的原因所造成的，而是有其巩固的基础的。这个基础就是美国巨大金融利益集团给所有拉丁美洲人民所造成的经济、社会和政治的现实情况。他号召古巴和拉丁美洲其他各国的人民加强团结，反对过去压迫古巴，现在还继续压迫拉丁美洲各国人民的那个帝国主义。
    他又说，古巴革命得到拉丁美洲各国人民的战斗性的积极支持，因为拉丁美洲各国人民具有共同的任务。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：拉丁美洲公众纷纷谴责美国对古巴的侵略阴谋，支持古巴人民的正义斗争。
    阿根廷声援古巴革命委员会在最近举行的全体会议上通过一项声明，谴责帝国主义对古巴的侵略。声明还表示祝贺古巴人民在推进革命，特别在土地改革中取得的成就。会议决定举行第一次全国大会，以便开展一次支持古巴革命的全国性运动。在举行全国大会以前，将在各省举行大会，并且展开宣传古巴革命成就的活动。
    巴西各界人士支持古巴接管美国石油公司。全国银行职工联合会主席温贝托·梅尼塞斯说，接管是在维护古巴主权的正义的理由下进行的。调查并保卫石油理事会主席费利西斯摩·卡多索将军对拉丁美洲通讯社记者说，菲德尔·卡斯特罗政府接管外国石油公司这一点作的很对。前圣保罗州众议员莱昂尼达斯·卡多索将军认为，古巴接管外国炼油厂是关系到经济解放和政治主权的问题。他说，古巴还要进行很多斗争，而古巴目前正在勇敢地这样作。巴西全国石油委员会第一任主席奥尔塔·门多萨将军说，我不能不为古巴所采取的维护民族利益的态度而鼓掌。阿图罗·卡尔纳乌巴将军也认为古巴政府接管外国石油公司是维护自己国家利益的作法。这些发表谈话的将军们曾经积极参加1953年在巴西展开的争取巴西石油国有化运动。
    巴西最近一期的“新方针”周刊就美国政府为了对古巴进行武装干涉和经济侵略而采取的措施发表评论说：美帝国主义准备对古巴发动的战争，其矛头不仅是指向着卡斯特罗政府，而且是以拉丁美洲的经济和政治解放运动、以拉丁美洲各国人民的独立民主为对象的。
    这家周刊指出，美国对古巴的经济侵略的目标主要是集中在糖和石油这两方面。周刊说：对于巴西人来说，这种讹诈是容易理解的，因为美国对巴西采取了同样的侵略政策。
