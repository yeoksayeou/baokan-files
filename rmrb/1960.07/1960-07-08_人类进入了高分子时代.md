    Mankind Enters the Age of Polymers
  　Wang Baoren, Researcher at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Deputy Director of the Department of Polymer Chemistry and Physics, University of Science and Technology of China

　　"The second half of the twentieth century is when mankind enters the age of atomic energy and polymers." This is pointed out by Academician Semyonov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a Nobel Prize winner, and is generally recognized. Atomic energy is a new type of energy source, and polymers are new types of materials. They have caused fundamental changes in various productions, enabling production to achieve leap-forward development. Continuous innovation in production technology and continuous improvement of tools enable continuous improvement and development of productivity. The material basis for realizing new technologies and new tools is the acquisition of new materials. Human history can be divided into eras based on the materials used, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc. Since this century, a large class of polymer materials has emerged. They have various superior properties that old materials do not have, enabling continuous technological innovation and rapid production development, greatly enriching the material life of mankind. Therefore, polymers are considered a class of epoch-making materials.
    The term polymer is still relatively unfamiliar to the general reader. It is a general term for plastics, fibers, and rubber, and also includes paints, synthetic resins, adhesives, and so on. From a chemical point of view, these materials are all composed of very large molecules, thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of times larger than the molecules in ordinary compounds. Therefore, they are collectively referred to as polymers.
    Nature has many polymers that have long been used in production and life, such as proteins, starch, cellulose, silk, wool, natural rubber, etc. Because these natural polymers have a certain composition and structure, their properties are fixed, and their use has certain limitations. Only in this century have people created many artificial synthetic polymers using chemical methods.
    Synthetic polymers have three major characteristics that other materials do not have:
    1.  Many varieties and properties, which can adapt to the diverse requirements of production for material properties. Since the discovery of phenolic plastics at the beginning of this century, hundreds of varieties of polymer materials have been produced through continuous research. From these hundreds of materials, countless commodities and raw materials have been made using different methods of use. There are more than 10,000 kinds of rubber products alone. New varieties of polymer materials are constantly being added. Each variety has its own special properties. At present, apart from electrical and thermal conductivity, where polymers cannot yet meet the requirements, any special performance material needed in industrial production can be found among polymer varieties. Not only that, but we can also find polymer materials that have several properties at the same time. For example, we have reinforced plastics that are stronger than steel and do not conduct electricity, organic glass that is more transparent than glass and cannot be broken, and film materials that have better insulation than mica and are light, flexible, and continuous. People can synthesize polymer materials, so they can change their composition and structure to make their properties change greatly. With continuous research, we can potentially synthesize polymer materials with specified properties according to our wishes.
    2.  Abundant raw materials, not restricted by regional resources, can be produced in large quantities everywhere. We know that many industrial raw materials are restricted by resources, mineral deposits, or regional climates, such as various non-ferrous metals, alloy steels, etc. Only with those mines can those industries be established. Natural rubber, for example, can only grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Synthetic polymer materials are not subject to these restrictions. The raw materials needed to manufacture polymer materials are only air, water, salt, coal, and sand, etc., which are extremely abundant. If there is no coal, natural gas, petroleum, or shale oil can be used instead. If none of these are available, industrial and agricultural by-products and "waste" can also be used. Of course, from the perspective of polymer chemistry, there is no such thing as "waste." Many industrial and agricultural by-products can be used as raw materials for the polymer industry, which is more conducive to the comprehensive utilization of resources.
    3.  Convenient processing and molding, suitable for high-speed production. Polymer materials can be processed into various parts and finished products using various methods such as die-casting, extrusion, blow molding, drawing, and spraying. Moreover, the manufactured parts are accurate in size, smooth, and fine, and can be used without modification. For example, to make a gear, just melt the polymer material and inject it into a mold, and it becomes a smooth gear when taken out. One such gear can be made per minute. If metal is used, it requires many processes. To make a plastic hull, it can also be die-cast in a mold. If steel is used, many processes are required from rolling, cutting, to riveting and welding. The trend of social development requires production to be carried out at high speed. Many old materials are difficult to meet this requirement, while polymers meet people's ideals, and the processing and molding of polymer materials can be continuously accelerated.
    Due to these advantages of polymer materials, countries around the world are currently developing the polymer industry in large quantities. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan stipulates that the production of plastics and synthetic resins should be increased by more than six times, and the production of man-made fibers will be increased by three times, among which the most valuable synthetic fibers will be increased by eleven to twelve times. According to statistics in 1956, the per capita consumption of polymer products in the United States was 11.1 kilograms, West Germany 10.1 kilograms, the United Kingdom 6.7 kilograms, and Japan 2.4 kilograms.
    Countries are vigorously carrying out polymer research. It is estimated that chemists directly engaged in polymer research account for more than half. A large number of physicists and mechanics are also studying the properties of polymers. As for the scientists who study the industrial application of polymer materials, it is impossible to count them. Since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called for vigorous development of synthetic materials, not only organic chemists are almost all studying polymers, but also many inorganic chemists, analytical chemists, physical chemists, some physicists, and mechanics are conducting research with polymers as the object.
    Many applications of polymers in daily life are already well known. For example, nylon stockings and nylon underwear are durable and easy to wash. Outerwear made of synthetic fiber materials, once ironed, never needs to be ironed again. They are also not afraid of insect bites, mold, or rot.
    Polymer materials are also gradually being used as building materials. Water pipes and sewer pipes are made of polymer materials, which do not rust or corrode, are lightweight, and are convenient for welding and installation. Using polymers as wall panels and ceilings provides good insulation and soundproofing, and are clean and not easily contaminated. Polymer materials can also be made into large prefabricated components, which can speed up the construction of houses. In the near future, we will see houses assembled entirely from plastic.
    The use of polymer materials in transportation also has great prospects. Car bodies, train carriages, and ship hulls made of reinforced plastics have similar strength to steel, are wear-resistant, elastic, impact-resistant, lightweight, and save power. The interior of cars and airplanes already uses many polymer materials. A Tu-104 jet aircraft has 110,000 parts made of polymer materials.
    The machine manufacturing industry is also gradually using polymer materials. The wear resistance of plastic bearings used in heavy machines such as rolling mills is greatly increased compared to metal bearings, which can reduce the number of inspections and replacements. Using plastic to make gears can reduce noise. Plastic gears and transmission components can also eliminate the need for lubricating oil and eliminate the danger of product contamination from oil stains, which is even more significant for the textile and food industries. When flipping sand, adding a small amount of polymer binder to the molding sand can make the surface of castings smooth and reduce the wheel grinding process.
    There is now a polymer adhesive that can bond steel plates together. The strength of the bonded area is very high. When subjected to strong tension, the steel plate breaks, but the bonded area does not come off. A steel bridge has been built abroad that is not riveted and welded but glued with adhesive. The large-scale application of this adhesive will bring about major changes in the machine manufacturing industry.
    In the electrical industry, the manufacture of generators and motors is impossible without polymer insulating paint and various insulating materials. New types of insulating materials can also increase operating temperatures, reduce the size of motors and motors, thereby increasing power and saving raw materials.
    High-frequency insulation and high-voltage insulation materials used in radio equipment and various electronic communication equipment are mostly made of polymers.
    In the chemical industry, the corrosion of equipment is an extremely serious problem. In addition to using polymers as anti-corrosion paints and anti-corrosion linings, polymer materials are now widely used to make pipelines and reactors. Using synthetic fibers to make filter cloths and work clothes can prevent the erosion of strong acids and alkalis.
    In agriculture, polymers are also gradually being used. Covering a transparent polymer film on a nursery can maintain the temperature of the seedbed, which can advance the planting period and delay the harvest period, which is conducive to increasing production. There is also a polymer that can be sprayed on rice fields, which can float on the water surface and form a very thin film, which can prevent water evaporation and maintain the temperature of the rice fields, increasing rice production. There are also polymers that consolidate and improve soil, which have the effects of making the soil granular, preventing water leakage, and preserving fertility.
    An important issue in agricultural production is water. Salt and alkaline water and seawater cannot be used for irrigation. It is now possible to use polymers to remove salt and alkali from water. Although it is not economical enough to do so now, through research, it will definitely be possible to economically and conveniently use "alkaline water" and "seawater" to irrigate fields in the future.
    In medical and health care, polymers also have many applications. The application of polymer materials in plastic surgery is increasing. In internal body surgery, the use of plastic balls as chest cavity fillers and plastic tubes to connect blood vessels has good results. Orthopedics also uses adhesives to glue broken bones together, greatly simplifying the medical process. The use of polymers to remove ammonia, urea, etc. from the blood to replace kidney function is also effective.
    In modern cutting-edge technologies, polymer materials play an extremely important role. In the peaceful use of atomic energy, space exploration technology, and remote control systems, synthetic polymer materials can meet the requirements of certain special properties.
    Polymer materials have great prospects, but as epoch-making materials, there are still many shortcomings to be improved. First, although its raw materials are abundant, the manufacturing steps are relatively complicated, so the price is relatively expensive. Secondly, the performance is not yet perfect, and it has not been completely achieved to synthesize polymers with specified properties. The third is that the processing and molding methods are still based on experience. Whether it is the most reasonable and how to make the manufactured parts exhibit the most superior performance still lacks guiding theory. The fourth is that polymer materials are not durable enough and will gradually age and deteriorate during use.
    Therefore, there are many subjects in the field of polymers, such as monomer synthesis routes, polymerization reaction mechanisms, the structure and properties of polymers, polymer mechanics, processing principles and processing machinery, the mechanism of aging and prevention, etc., which must be vigorously studied.
    Under the glorious guidance of the General Line, polymer workers in our country are working hard with full confidence. It can be expected that polymer materials will definitely play their greatest role in all aspects of the motherland's socialist construction.

    人类进入了高分子时代
  　中国科学院化学研究所研究员 中国科学技术大学高分子化学和高分子物理系副主任  王葆仁
　　“二十世纪下半世纪，人类进入了原子能和高分子时代”。这是苏联科学院院士、诺贝尔奖金获得者谢苗诺夫所指出并为大家所公认的。原子能是新型的能源，高分子是新型的材料，它们对各种生产已引起根本性的变化，使生产获得飞跃的发展。生产技术的不断革新和工具的不断改进，使生产力不断提高和发展。实现新技术和新工具的物质基础是新材料的取得。人类的历史可以借使用的材料来划分时代，如石器时代、铜器时代、铁器时代等。本世纪以来，出现了一大类高分子材料，它们具有旧材料所没有的各种优越性能，使技术不断革新，生产迅速发展，人类物质生活大大地丰富起来。因此高分子被认为是一类划时代的材料。
    高分子这个名词对一般读者还比较生疏。它是塑料、纤维和橡胶的总称，还包括油漆、合成树脂、胶合剂等等。这些材料从化学的观点看来都是由很巨大的分子组成的，比一般化合物里的分子大几千倍、几万倍甚至几百万倍。因此，它们被总称为高分子。
    自然界有许多高分子早已在生产和生活中被人们利用了，如蛋白质、淀粉、纤维素、蚕丝、羊毛、天然橡胶等等。由于这些天然高分子具有一定的组成和结构，它们的性能是固定的，使用起来有一定的局限性。本世纪以来，人们才用化学方法创造了许多人工合成的高分子。
    合成高分子具有三大特点，为其它材料所不及：
    一、品种多，性能多，可以适应生产对材料性能的多种要求。自从本世纪初酚醛塑料被发现以来，经过不断的研究，已生产出几百个品种的高分子材料。从这几百种材料中，还以不同的使用方法制成了不计其数的商品和原料。光是橡胶制品就在一万种以上。新品种的高分子材料还在不断增加。每一个品种，都有各自的特殊性能。目前，除了在导电导热方面，高分子还不能满足要求以外，工业生产上需要那一种特殊性能的材料，都可以在高分子品种中找到。不仅如此，我们还可以找到同时具有几种性能的高分子材料，比如我们有强度大过钢而不传电的增强塑料，有透光度大过玻璃而敲不碎的有机玻璃，有绝缘性胜过云母而轻柔不断的薄膜材料等等。人们既可以合成高分子材料，就可以变化它们的组成和结构，使它们的性能有很大幅度的变化。随着不断地研究，我们有可能按照意愿来合成具有指定性能的高分子材料。
    二、原料丰富，不受地区资源的限制，到处可以大量生产。我们知道，许多工业原材料都受资源、矿藏或地区气候的限制，比如各种有色金属、合金钢等，有那些矿才能建立那些工业。又如天然橡胶只能在热带亚热带生长。合成高分子材料就不受这些限制。制造高分子材料所需要的原料只是空气、水、盐、煤和砂石等，这些都是极其丰富的。如果没有煤，还可以改用天然气、石油或是页岩油。如果这些都没有，还可以用工农业副产品和“废料”。当然，从高分子化学的角度来看，是没有“废料”的，工业农业的副产品，许多都可以作为高分子工业的原料，这更有利于综合利用资源。
    三、加工成型方便，适宜于高速度生产。高分子材料可以用压铸、挤注、吹制、拉延、喷敷等种种方法加工成为各种部件和成品。并且制成的部件尺寸准确，光滑细致，不须修整就可应用。比如做一个齿轮，只要把高分子材料熔化后挤注到一个模子里去，取出来就成为光洁的齿轮。这种齿轮一分钟可做一个。如果用金属来做就需要很多工序。要做一个塑料船壳，也可以在模子里压铸出来。如果用钢来做，从延压、切割到铆焊要很多工序。社会发展的趋势要求高速度地进行生产，许多旧材料都难于适合这个要求，而高分子是符合人们的理想的，何况高分子材料的加工成型还可以不断提高速度。
    由于高分子材料具有这样一些优越性，目前世界各国都在大量发展高分子工业。苏联的七年计划规定塑料和合成树脂的生产要增加六倍以上，人造纤维的生产将增加三倍，其中最贵重的合成纤维将增加十一到十二倍。根据1956年的统计，美国高分子产品按人口计算每人为十一点一公斤，西德十点一公斤，英国六点七公斤，日本二点四公斤。
    各国都在大力开展高分子的研究工作。估计化学家直接从事于高分子研究的约占半数以上。在物理学家和力学家中也有大批的人研究高分子的性能。至于研究高分子材料在工业上的应用的科学家就无从统计了。苏联自从苏共第二十一次代表大会号召大力发展合成材料以后，不但有机化学家几乎全部都研究高分子，而且许多无机化学家、分析化学家、物理化学家、一部分物理学家和力学家都在以高分子为对象进行研究。
    高分子在日常生活中的应用，不少已为人所熟知。如尼龙袜和尼龙内衣耐穿，容易洗。合成纤维料子做的外衣，一次烫好以后，永远不用再烫。它们还不怕虫蚀，不霉不烂。
    建筑材料，现在也逐渐应用高分子材料。自来水管、下水道管用高分子材料来做，不生锈腐蚀，还很轻巧，焊接装置方便。用高分子做墙板、天花板，保温和隔音很好，而且干净不易污染。高分子材料还可以做成大块预制构件，可以加快房屋的建筑。不久的将来，我们会看到全部用塑料装配成的房屋。
    在交通运输方面利用高分子材料，同样大有前途，用增强塑料做成的汽车车身、火车车厢和轮船外壳，强度和钢相仿，既耐磨，又有弹性耐冲击，质量轻，动力省。汽车和飞机的内部已经采用了很多高分子材料。一架图—104喷气飞机，用高分子材料做成的零件，有十一万个。
    机器制造工业也逐渐采用高分子材料。重型机器如轧钢机的轴瓦用塑料做的比金属做的耐磨性大大增加，可以减少检修调换次数。用塑料做齿轮可以减少噪音，塑料制的齿轮和传动部件，还可以不用润滑油，消灭成品受油渍的危险，这对纺织工业和食品工业的机器意义更为重大。在翻沙的时候，型沙中加进少量的高分子胶合剂可以使铸件表面平整光滑，减少车轮工序。
    现在已经有了一种高分子胶合剂可以把钢板胶合起来，胶合的地方强度很高，在受到大力拉伸时，钢板断了，胶合的地方还不脱落。国外已经建成一座不用铆焊而是用胶合剂胶起来的铁桥。这种胶合剂大量应用后，将使机器制造业发生重大的变革。
    在电器工业里，发电机和马达的制造，如果不用高分子绝缘漆和各种绝缘材料是不可能的。新型的绝缘材料还可以使运转温度提高，电机和马达的体积缩小，从而增加功率和节省原材料。
    无线电器材和各种电子通讯器材所用的高频绝缘和高压绝缘材料，大部分都是高分子做成的。
    在化学工业中，器材的腐蚀是极其严重的问题。除了利用高分子作为防腐漆和防腐衬里以外，现在已大量使用高分子材料做管道和反应器。用合成纤维做滤布和工作服可以防止强酸强碱的侵蚀。
    在农业方面，高分子也逐渐地被利用了。把一种透明高分子薄膜复盖在苗圃上，可以保持苗床的温度，这样就可以提早植物的播种期延迟收获期，有利于增产。还有一种高分子，喷洒在稻田里，可以浮在水面上，形成很薄很薄的一层膜，可以防止水份蒸发，保持稻田温度，使水稻增产。另外还有加固土壤和改良土壤的高分子，具有使土壤成粒，不漏水，保存肥力等功效。
    农业生产上重要的问题是水，盐碱水和海水不能用来灌溉。现在已经可以用高分子来除去水中的盐份、碱份。尽管现在这样做还不够经济，通过研究，将来一定可以经济方便地利用“碱水”和“海水”来灌溉田园。
    在医疗保健方面，高分子也有了不少应用。高分子材料在外科整形方面的应用已日益增多。在身体内部手术上，用塑料球做胸腔填充物，用塑料管连接血管，都有很好的效果。骨科还用胶合剂把断折的骨头粘在一起，大大简化了医疗过程。利用高分子来除去血中的氨、尿素等以代替肾脏的功能，也行之有效。
    在现代的各种尖端技术中，高分子材料占有极其重要的意义。在和平利用原子能，探空技术以及遥远控制系统等方面，用合成的高分子材料可以满足具有某些特殊性能的要求。
    高分子材料有它的伟大前途，但是作为划时代的材料来说，目前还存在有不少缺点要加以改进。首先，它的原料虽然丰富，但制造步骤比较复杂，因此价格较贵。其次，性能还不完备，还没有完全做到合成具有指定性能的高分子。第三是加工成型方法，还只凭经验，是否最合理，怎样使制成的部件表现出最优越的性能还缺少指导性的理论。第四是高分子材料还不够耐久，在使用过程中会逐渐老化变质。
    因此，在高分子方面有许多课题，如单体合成路线、聚合反应机理、高分子的结构与性能、高分子力学、加工原理和加工机械、老化的机理和防止等等，都必须大力进行研究。
    我国高分子工作者在总路线的光辉照耀下，正满怀信心努力工作。可以预期，高分子材料必将在祖国社会主义建设的各个方面发挥它最大的作用。
