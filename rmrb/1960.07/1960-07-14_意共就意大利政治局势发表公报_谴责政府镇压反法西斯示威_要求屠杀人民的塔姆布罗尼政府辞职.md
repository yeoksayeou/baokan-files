　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 12th: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party published a communiqué on the Italian political situation in "Unità" on the 9th.

　　The communiqué expressed respect for the general strike and demonstrations held across Italy on the 8th, and expressed outrage at the bloody provocations and atrocities committed by the police in Reggio Emilia, Licata, Rome, and other cities. The communiqué said that the demonstrations had proven the Italian people's loyalty to democracy and anti-fascist beliefs, condemning and isolating those responsible for the massacre that stained the country with blood.

　　The communiqué condemned Italian Prime Minister Tambroni's attempts in the Chamber of Deputies to strengthen the government's suppression of the people's movement. The communiqué pointed out that the government wanted to seize the opportunity to use "emergency measures" to deprive the working people of the rights guaranteed by the Italian Constitution. The communiqué called for the establishment of a competent government that cares about the needs of the working masses, believing this to be the primary condition for easing domestic tensions.

　　The communiqué considered the proposal by Catholic Democrat and President of the Senate, Merzagora, for a fifteen-day political truce and a comprehensive parliamentary debate on the current political situation to be feasible, and agreed to begin the parliamentary debate on the political situation on the 12th.

　　The "political truce" proposal was put forward by Merzagora on the morning of the 8th, after several consecutive days of large-scale anti-fascist demonstrations and protests against the government's bloody suppression. The proposal called for the police and armed forces to remain in their barracks for fifteen days, except for performing "routine duties," while the trade unions and the Resistance movement would also suspend strikes and public demonstrations during this period.

　　The Italian Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, and the National Committee of the Resistance Movement expressed their agreement with Merzagora's proposal, but they emphasized that the Tambroni government, which had bloodily massacred the people, must resign. The Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Radical Party also expressed their acceptance of Merzagora's proposal.

　　The Tambroni government and his Catholic Democratic Party insisted on their policy of massacring the people's movement. The party did not formally express its attitude towards Merzagora's proposal, but on the afternoon of the day Merzagora's proposal was put forward, the police were ordered to open fire on demonstrators in Palermo and Catania, Sicily, resulting in a new bloodbath that killed three people. That evening, the government issued a communiqué still threatening to intensify the suppression of the people.

　　The New Fascist Party, spurned by the people, also opposed Merzagora's proposal and supported the Tambroni government's position.

　　The "American Daily," published by the U.S. Embassy in Rome, and the Vatican's "L'Osservatore Romano" blatantly supported the Tambroni government and advocated intensified suppression.

　　Currently, mass demonstrations are still taking place across Italy. In Palermo, a major city in Sicily, tens of thousands of people held a silent funeral procession for the victims. In Turin, thousands of people demonstrated, demanding the banning of the New Fascist Party. Anti-fascist mass rallies were also held in other cities such as Venice, Carrara, Mantua, Rovigo, Pescara, and Aritzo.

　　意共就意大利政治局势发表公报
　　谴责政府镇压反法西斯示威
　　要求屠杀人民的塔姆布罗尼政府辞职
    新华社12日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党领导机构9日在“团结报”上就意大利政治局势发表一项公报。
    公报对8日在意大利全国各地举行的总罢工和示威，表示敬意，并且对于警察在勒佐—艾米里亚、利卡塔、罗马和其他城市进行的血腥挑衅和暴行表示愤慨。公报说，这次示威已经证明了意大利人民忠实于民主和反法西斯信念，谴责和孤立了使全国染上鲜血的屠杀的负责人。
    公报谴责意大利总理塔姆布罗尼在众议院表示的政府要加强镇压人民运动的企图。公报指出，政府想乘机使用“紧急手段”来剥夺意大利宪法规定的劳动人民应享有的权利。公报要求成立有能力的、关心劳动群众需要的政府，认为这是使国内紧张局势缓和的首要条件。
    公报认为，天主教民主党人、参议院议长梅查戈拉提出的在政治上暂时休战十五天和就目前政治局势举行全面议会辩论的建议是可行的，并且同意在12日开始在议会就政治局势进行辩论。
    关于“政治休战”的建议是梅查戈拉在意大利全国连续几天发生反法西斯和抗议政府血腥镇压的大示威后在8日上午提出来的，这个建议要求：在十五天内，除执行“日常职务”的以外，警察和武装部队都留在军营里，而工会和抵抗运动在这个期间也停止罢工和公众示威。
    意大利共产党、总工会和抵抗运动全国委员会表示同意梅查戈拉的建议，但是它们强调血腥屠杀人民的塔姆布罗尼政府必须辞职。社会党、社会民主党、共和党和激进党也表示接受梅查戈拉的建议。
    塔姆布罗尼政府和他的天主教民主党则坚持对人民运动的屠杀政策。这个党没有对梅查戈拉建议正式表示态度，但是在梅查戈拉建议提出后的当天中午，警察又奉令在西西里的巴勒莫和喀大尼亚向示威群众开枪，造成了使三人死亡的新的血案。当天晚上，政府发表的公报仍然威胁说要加紧对人民的镇压。
    受到人民唾弃的新法西斯党也反对梅查戈拉的建议，而支持塔姆布罗尼政府的立场。
    美国大使馆在罗马出版的“美国人报”和梵蒂冈的“罗马观察家报”都露骨地支持塔姆布罗尼政府，鼓吹加紧镇压。
    目前意大利全国仍有群众示威发生，在西西里的大城市巴勒莫，成千上万的群众为死难者举行了一次沉默的送葬示威游行。在都灵，数千人举行了示威，要求取缔新法西斯党。其他如威尼斯、卡拉拉、孟都亚、罗维戈、贝斯加拉、阿留佐等城市也举行了反法西斯群众大会。
