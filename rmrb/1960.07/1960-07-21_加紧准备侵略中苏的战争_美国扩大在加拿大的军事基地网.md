    Stepping up preparations for a war of aggression against China and the Soviet Union
    The United States expands its military base network in Canada
    Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 17th: According to a recent exposé in the Canadian "Pacific Tribune," the United States is intensifying its expansion of a military base network in Canada aimed at the Soviet Union and China.
    The "Pacific Tribune" published a report by its reporter, Raschi, stating that "the U.S. Pentagon intends to turn British Columbia [in Canada] into a military base for nuclear war. The plan has reached a considerable stage. It is now being continuously supplemented." The report also said, "Having been driven out of many countries due to public protests, U.S. military planners are now seeking new 'reliable' missile bases in Canada and on Canada's Pacific coast," "The U.S. military hopes to build a series of mobile and fixed nuclear missile launch sites (in Canada) for the U.S. Army."
    The report stated, "U.S. military planners are fully aware of the strategic value of British Columbia in a nuclear missile war. … The province's geographical location puts Siberia and Chinese territory within the range of intercontinental ballistic missiles. In addition, this vast province, with its forests, mountains, and valleys, provides (from their point of view) ideal missile launch sites and bases for American bombers, rockets, and spy planes."

    加紧准备侵略中苏的战争
    美国扩大在加拿大的军事基地网
    新华社17日讯　渥太华消息：据加拿大“太平洋论坛报”最近揭露，美国正加紧在加拿大扩大矛头指向苏联和中国的军事基地网。
    “太平洋论坛报”刊载它的记者腊希的一篇报道说，“美国五角大楼正打算把（加拿大的）英属哥伦比亚变成核战争的一个军事基地。计划已经拟订到相当阶段。现在正在继续补充。”报道还说，“由于在许多国家公众的抗议下被赶了出来，美国军事计划人员现在正在加拿大和加拿大的太平洋海岸寻找新的‘可靠的’导弹基地”，“美国军方希望为美国陆军（在加拿大）修建一系列的机动和固定的核导弹发射场。”
    报道说，“美国的军事计划人员充分认识到英属哥伦比亚在核导弹战争中的战略价值。……这个省的地理位置把西伯利亚和中国领土置于洲际弹道导弹的射程之内。此外，这个面积辽阔的省份有着森林、山岭和河谷，（从他们的观点看来）提供了理想的导弹发射场和美国轰炸机、火箭和间谍飞机的基地。”
