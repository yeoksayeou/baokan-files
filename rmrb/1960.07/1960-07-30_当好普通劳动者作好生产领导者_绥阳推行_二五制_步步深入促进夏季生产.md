Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 28th – Since Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, more than 80% of cadres at the county and commune levels have gone deep into the front lines of production, more than doubling the previous number. These cadres have generally achieved eating, living, laboring, and discussing matters together with the masses. Their work is more solid and in-depth, their connection with the masses is closer, and their leadership skills are constantly improving, promoting the vigorous development of the current summer production campaign centered on field management.

When the county first implemented the "Two-Five System," some cadres, due to lack of experience, encountered two problems after going deep into the grassroots: One was burying themselves in labor with the masses without both participating in and leading production; the other was "flying all over the sky" without stopping, neither having the opportunity to participate in production nor leading production in a down-to-earth manner. After discovering this problem, the county party committee emphasized to all cadres that they must closely integrate participation in production with leading production, conduct meticulous investigation and research work through participation in production, combine this with studying Chairman Mao's works, raise the problems seen in production to the level of theory, and help grassroots cadres improve their leadership skills, so that production is both vigorous and solid. The county party committee also required leading members of the county party committee and party secretaries at all levels to set an example, leading the broad masses of cadres to truly go deep into reality and deep into the masses, using both their hands and their brains, participating in production and leading production. Yang Caishu, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, went deep into the Chenguang Production Team of Wangcao Commune, and while weeding rice seedlings with commune members, discovered that the rice tillers were few. He invited old farmers, small team leaders, and others to study the matter together, finding that the main reason for the few tillers was insufficient base fertilizer. Through this incident, he educated the grassroots cadres on working methods. Under his influence, all the commune cadres studied the problem of insufficient base fertilizer with the masses and quickly launched a campaign to accumulate quick-acting fertilizer. On average, more than 4,000 jin of quick-acting fertilizer was applied per mu of rice in the entire commune, increasing the number of tillers per rice seedling clump from more than ten to more than twenty.

Under the leadership and influence of party secretaries at all levels, every cadre who goes deep into the front line now has "six things" (a hoe, sickle, straw sandals, rain gear, work point booklet, and work-study notebook), participating in production wherever they go, studying and solving problems in production and life together with the masses, forming a new work style of not leaving the fields during the day, not leaving the small teams at night, and stationing in places where work is backward. Liu Shaoyun, party branch secretary of the Xinchang Brigade of the Xinle Management District of Huangjian Commune, studied the working methods of commune party secretary Wang Dezhong, who checked production in the morning, participated in production at noon, and helped small team cadres solve problems in the evening. He went deep into the Xinxing Small Team, where field management was not well done, and ate, lived, worked, and discussed matters together with the commune members. He found that the reason for the poor field management of this small team was mainly the slackening of leadership cadres and poor labor organization. He convened a meeting of small team cadres to study the matter, criticizing the slackening thought and helping them arrange labor to make a concentrated effort to weed. Within five days, the entire team applied 2,000 jin of quick-acting fertilizer per mu of paddy field, bringing the field management work up to par with other small teams.

In participating in production and leading production, all cadres in the county seize the two days of learning, meetings, and inspection work stipulated in the "Two-Five System" to carefully study and summarize their work, and in conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's works, raise the problems existing in their work to the level of theory and continuously improve their leadership skills. After studying Chairman Mao's article "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," many cadres further recognized the importance of caring for the lives of the masses and often paid attention to inspecting the canteen work.

### 当好普通劳动者作好生产领导者  绥阳推行“二五制”步步深入促进夏季生产

    当好普通劳动者作好生产领导者
    绥阳推行“二五制”步步深入促进夏季生产
    新华社贵阳28日电　贵州省绥阳县推行“二五制”领导方法以后，县和公社两级80％以上的干部深入到生产第一线，比过去增加了一倍多。这些干部普遍做到了和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，工作更加扎实深入，和群众的联系更加密切，干部领导水平不断提高，促进了当前以田间管理为中心的夏季生产运动蓬勃开展。
    这个县在开始推行“二五制”时，有些干部由于缺乏经验，在深入下去以后发生了两个问题：一种是埋头和群众一起劳动，没有作到参加生产，同时又领导生产；另一种是不停脚地“满天飞”，既没有机会参加生产，也没有扎扎实实地领导生产。县委发现这个问题以后，向全县干部强调指出必须把参加生产和领导生产紧密结合起来，要通过参加生产细致地作调查研究工作，结合学习毛主席著作，把生产中看到的问题提高到理论上来认识，并帮助基层干部提高领导水平，使生产搞得既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。县委还要求县委的领导成员和各级党委书记要作出样子，带动广大干部切实深入实际、深入群众，既动手又动脑，参加生产领导生产。县委书记处书记杨才书深入到旺草公社辰光生产队，和社员一起薅秧，发现水稻分蘖较少，便邀集老农、小队长等共同研究，找到分蘖少的主要原因是底肥不足，并通过这件事对基层干部进行了一次工作方法的教育。全社干部在他的影响下，都同群众一起认真研究了底肥不足的问题，很快掀起了积造速效肥的运动，全社每亩水稻平均追施速效肥四千多斤，使水稻每窝由过去分蘖十多片增加到二十多片。
    在各级党委书记的带动和影响下，现在全县每个深入第一线的干部都做到了“六有”（有锄头、镰刀、草鞋、雨具、工分手册、工作学习笔记本），走到哪里就在哪里参加生产，同群众一起研究解决生产和生活中的问题，形成了白天不离田间，晚上不离小队，哪里工作后进就到哪里蹲点的新作风。黄枧公社新乐管理区新昶大队党支部书记刘绍云，学习了公社党委书记汪德仲早上检查生产、中午参加生产、晚上帮助小队干部解决问题的工作方法后，深入到田间管理搞得不好的新星小队，和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。他发现这个小队田间管理搞不好的原因主要是领导干部松劲，劳动组织得不好，便召集小队干部开会研究，批判了松劲思想，并帮助他们安排了劳力突击薅秧，五天内全队稻田每亩追了速效肥两千斤，使田间管理工作赶上了其他小队。
    在参加生产领导生产中，全县干部都抓紧“二五制”中规定的两天学习、开会和检查工作的时间，认真研究总结工作，并结合学习毛主席著作，把工作中存在的问题提高到理论上认识，不断提高领导水平。许多干部在学习了毛主席“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的文章后，进一步认识到关心群众生活的重要性，经常注意检查食堂工作。
