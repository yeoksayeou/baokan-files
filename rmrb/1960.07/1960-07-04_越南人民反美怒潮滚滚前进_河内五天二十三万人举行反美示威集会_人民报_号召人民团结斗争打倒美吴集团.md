Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd -- The movement launched by people from all walks of life in Hanoi in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is advancing wave upon wave. From June 29th to the morning of July 3rd, 234,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi participated in rallies and demonstrations against the U.S.-Ngo clique.

Yesterday, from morning till night, factories, government offices, schools, and street communities in Hanoi continued to hold many rallies and demonstrations. The slogans "Down with U.S. imperialism" and "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan" resounded throughout the city.

One thousand Hanoi art workers held a rally at the Red River Theater on the morning of July 2nd, denouncing the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Ngo clique in South Vietnam. After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration in the rain and submitted a letter of protest to the Hanoi office of the International Commission, expressing their firm opposition to the U.S.-Ngo clique's arms expansion, war preparations, suppression and persecution of patriotic people in South Vietnam, and demanding that the International Commission reconsider its conclusion on Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 and its resolution allowing the increase of military personnel in the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group."

More than 5,000 cadres and people gathered from South Vietnam held a rally on the evening of the 2nd, strongly condemning the U.S.-Ngo clique for ravaging their hometowns and massacring their parents and siblings. That evening, more than 300 Hanoi intellectuals also held a similar rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd -- The Vietnamese "People's Daily" emphasized in today's editorial entitled "U.S. Imperialism Get Out! Down with the U.S.-Ngo Clique!" that the Vietnamese people have a deep-seated hatred for the U.S.-Ngo clique, which they will never forget. We are determined to unite in struggle and defeat the enemy.

The editorial pointed out that U.S. imperialism, the head of the imperialist aggressors, is the most greedy and filthy common enemy standing before all mankind. The editorial pointed out that the people of all countries are uniting more and more closely on the road to realizing the common ideals of peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

The editorial strongly condemned the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam. The editorial pointed out that ten years ago, just when the French colonial army was exhausted, it was U.S. imperialism that helped them prolong the "dirty war," causing the Vietnamese people to shed more blood and adding more suffering to our land. The editorial pointed out that nearly six years have passed since the signing of the Geneva Accords, and U.S. imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem have always sabotaged the implementation of the agreement, causing the territory of Vietnam to remain divided, causing millions of families to be unable to reunite in a joyful environment, and causing the people in the South to live in hardship and hatred, living in a suffocating atmosphere full of gunpowder and blood. The editorial pointed out that the roar of hatred for U.S. imperialism resounds throughout the five continents. In Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, despite the heavy rain, our people still held rallies and demonstrations, chanting in unison the slogans: "U.S. Imperialism Get Out!" and "Down with the U.S.-Ngo Clique!" The editorial said that we must strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country and force the South Vietnamese authorities to respect and strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

    新华社河内3日电　河内市各界人民为响应祖国战线中央委员会的号召而展开的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的运动，正一浪高一浪地滚滚前进。从6月29日到7月3日早晨为止，河内各界人民参加反对美吴集团的集会和示威游行的已达二十三万四千人。
    昨天从早到晚河内市各工厂、机关、学校、街区继续举行了许多集会和示威游行。“打倒美帝国主义”、“美帝国主义从南越、朝鲜、台湾、日本滚出去”的口号声响彻全城。
    河内艺术工作者一千人2日上午在红河戏院举行集会，怒斥美吴集团在南越的滔天罪行。会后与会者冒雨举行了示威游行，并向国际委员会河内办事处递交了一份抗议书，表示坚决反对美吴集团扩军备战和镇压，迫害南越爱国人民，要求国际委员会重新考虑它对1959年第十号法令的结论和允许美国“军事援助顾问团”增加军事人员的决议。
    南越集结干部和人民五千多人2日晚上举行了集会，强烈谴责美吴集团蹂躏他们的家乡，屠杀他们的父母兄弟。这天晚上，河内知识分子三百多人也举行了同样的集会。
    新华社河内3日电　越南“人民报”今天在题为“美帝国主义滚出去！打倒美吴集团！”的社论中强调说，越南人民对美吴集团怀着刻骨的仇恨，万世不忘。我们坚决团结斗争，一定要打败敌人。
    社论指出，帝国主义侵略者的魁首美帝国主义，是站在全人类面前的最贪婪、最龌龊的共同敌人。社论指出，各国人民在为实现和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的共同理想的道路上，正在日益紧密地团结在一起。
    社论强烈谴责美帝国主义在南越的滔天罪行。社论指出，十年前，正当法国殖民主义军队陷于精疲力尽的境地的时候，正是美帝国主义帮助它们拖延“龌龊的战争”，使得越南人民多流了多少鲜血，在我们的国土上增加了多少苦难。社论指出，日内瓦协议签订到现在即将六年了，美帝国主义和它的走狗吴庭艳始终破坏这个协议的履行，使得越南的领土仍被分裂，使得成百万个家庭不能在欢乐的环境里团聚，使得南方的同胞生活在困苦和仇恨中，生活在充满火药味和鲜血的窒息空气中。社论指出，仇恨美帝国主义的吼声响遍了五大洲。在越南民主共和国的首都河内，尽管大雨滂沱，我国人民仍然举行集会和游行，齐声高呼：“美帝国主义滚出去！”“打倒美吴集团！”的口号。社论说，我们一定要增强全国人民的团结，迫使南越当局尊重和严正履行日内瓦协议。
