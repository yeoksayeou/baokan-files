According to a report in the Nanjing Xinhua Daily: After the output of the Nantong Steel Plant continued to grow, the supply of ore sometimes could not meet the needs, becoming a weak link in the entire plant. The leading cadres of the plant went deep into the front line and discovered that the reason the ore supply could not meet the needs was mainly because the ore crushing could not keep up; the reason the ore crushing could not keep up was because the crusher was prone to damage. Why was the crusher prone to damage? It turned out that there were some loopholes in production management. Large pieces of ore that should have been sent to the roughing mill were also sent to the crusher. The crusher could not handle such large pieces of ore, so it often broke down. Later, specific measures were taken to address this situation, and the situation changed within three days. The ore output per shift doubled.

It seems like a very small matter. But this small matter reveals a universal truth: Any work is organized by the coordinated actions of many small links. If one small link is not tightly grasped, and one concrete problem is not solved, it may affect the overall work. Sending small pieces of ore to the crusher and large pieces of ore to the roughing mill is such a concrete and small matter! However, if this matter is not handled well, it will affect the normal operation of the crusher, affect the ore crushing, and ultimately affect the ore supply in time, becoming a weak link in the entire plant's production. Only by solving such concrete problems one by one and grasping all the many small links can production be improved.

This is the case for the production of a factory, and it is also the case for the construction of the entire country. If we want to produce more steel, we must effectively grasp every link of coal, iron, ore, and transportation; and each link of coal, iron, ore, and transportation has its own specific problems that need to be concretely solved. For example, in order to strengthen mining work, we must specifically solve the problems of mining equipment, drainage and ventilation for deep mining, and transportation in mining areas, etc. If we want to improve product quality and produce first-class products, we must establish a higher quality concept among all employees, pay more attention to maintaining the good performance of equipment, ensure the accuracy of tools and fixtures, improve the technical level of workers, and have a strict quality inspection system that combines professional inspection and mass inspection. All of these tasks have many specific problems that need to be concretely solved. For example, in order to maintain the good performance of equipment, we must strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, educate employees to cherish equipment, and prepare necessary spare parts, etc. In short, the realization of any goal and the victory of any task depend on our conscientious and diligent work, on solving concrete problems one by one, and on overcoming all difficulties. "Trickles of water converge into rivers," the torrential river is gathered from drops of water, and any great victory of our cause is also built on the solid solution of concrete problems one by one, and gathered from many small achievements.

This style of solving concrete problems one by one is precisely the Marxist-Leninist style that our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have consistently advocated, which combines ambition with hard work and despising the enemy strategically with taking the enemy seriously tactically. Scientific socialism gives communists the ambition to dare to despise all enemies and build a new society on the ruins of the old world. The arduousness of the revolution and the twists and turns of the struggle stipulate that communists must work hard in a down-to-earth manner and concretely solve concrete problems one by one in order to complete their historical mission. The so-called down-to-earth hard work and solving concrete problems one by one means seeking truth from facts and conducting concrete analysis and concrete solutions to specific problems. What is seeking truth from facts? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, the laws, and 'seeking' is our research." This means that we must conduct specific analysis of specific situations in everything we do, proceed from reality, make the subjective conform to the objective, and plan our actions according to the inherent laws of objective things. This specific analysis of specific situations is what Lenin called "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism," and Comrade Mao Zedong has quoted Lenin's words more than once to educate us. We know that problems in work are contradictions that remain to be solved, and contradictions are all specific. Only by seeking truth from facts, being down-to-earth, and conducting specific analysis of specific situations can we grasp the particularity of the contradictions of various things, specifically solve problems one by one, and realize our ambitions.

In the practice of long-term revolutionary struggle and construction, this pragmatic Marxist-Leninist style, which combines ambition with hard work and despising the enemy strategically with taking the enemy seriously tactically, has become the style of our entire Party and become the Party's fine tradition. This is an important reason why we have been able to achieve continuous victories in revolutionary struggle and in the development of the cause of production and construction. Now, China's socialist construction has entered a new historical stage, that is, the stage where the development of the national economy has both the high speed of the Great Leap Forward and planned and proportional development. The beginning of this new historical stage means that we have found a Marxist-Leninist road to building socialism that suits China's specific conditions. On this broad road, the scale of our production and construction undertakings is getting larger and larger, and the requirements are getting higher and higher. Taking the entire national economy as an example, the rich practice of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years has made the internal connections of mutual promotion and mutual restriction between various departments of the national economy more fully displayed in front of us, requiring us to more deeply grasp the laws of its development, effectively grasp all aspects of the national economy, and first of all grasp agriculture. For each industrial and mining enterprise, the Great Leap Forward over the past two years has also created extremely favorable conditions, so that we can propose higher goals and move towards higher output, better quality, more varieties, and lower costs. This new situation requires us to further promote the style of hard work, to do our work deeper and deeper, finer and finer. Only in this way can we adapt to the new situation, solve new problems in time, and lead us from victory to victory.

Now the masses have a high degree of awareness and great enthusiasm, and every call of the Party can quickly turn into the conscious action of the masses, so the conditions for work are better than at any time in the past. However, precisely because the conditions are very good, we must not be negligent or engage in simple work, and we must especially emphasize the style of solving problems concretely in a down-to-earth manner. Otherwise, even if we have good conditions, we cannot achieve the ideal results. The style of work has an impact on production not only in a certain period, but also in another period. Therefore, we cannot pay attention to it sometimes and ignore it at other times. The issue of work style, as ideology and way of thinking, belongs to the category of the superstructure. The superstructure constantly acts on the economic base. We must always promote the Marxist-Leninist style of work. The fact that work is easier to do does not mean that we can ignore this style, but that we must further promote this style.

Perhaps some people feel that solving concrete problems one by one in a down-to-earth manner is somewhat bureaucratic and somewhat artisanal. Yes, the style of bureaucracy and artisanal methods is unacceptable. Comrades who are infected with this style often put the problems in their work on the same level, regardless of their importance and urgency. They are not good at first concentrating their efforts on solving key problems so that other problems can be solved easily. They are also not good at mobilizing the masses to do the work together. Instead, they take everything on themselves, regardless of its size. As a result, they are busy all the time and cannot solve any problems. Since the Great Leap Forward, attention has been universally paid to grasping politics, grasping ideology, and grasping key issues, and new working methods of the mass line have also been universally promoted. The style of bureaucracy and artisanal methods is becoming less and less. This is a great leap forward in work style and working methods. However, grasping politics, grasping ideology, and grasping general problems does not mean that we can ignore business-related, concrete, and individual problems. What we call business-related, concrete, and individual problems are not unimportant problems, but often important problems in specific work. If these problems are not solved, they will hinder the progress of production. Politics and business are a unity of opposites. Political work is the commander of all business work and serves economic work such as technology and business. Grasping politics and grasping ideology is precisely for the purpose of better solving concrete technical problems and business problems one by one. General and individual are also a unity of opposites. Grasping general problems is for the purpose of solving individual problems one by one; from the research and solution of individual problems one by one, we can gain experience and better guide the general. It can be seen that solving concrete problems one by one in a down-to-earth manner is completely different from bureaucracy and artisanal methods, but is a Marxist-Leninist style that combines the general and the individual and solves concrete problems concretely.

Half a year of 1960 has passed. In these six months, we have achieved new and major victories on the industrial front. The great technical innovation and technical revolution movement has raised our production to a new level. The task before us is to make persistent efforts, advance on the crest of victory, and achieve greater achievements in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. We should strive for high output, high quality, many varieties, and low costs, and comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plan. Now, leading cadres at all levels are going deep into the front line of production. How should we work after going deep into the front line of production? The most important thing is to lead by example, mobilize all employees with a pragmatic style that combines ambition with hard work and despising the enemy strategically with taking the enemy seriously tactically, and organize all employees to solve concrete problems one by one in a down-to-earth, thorough, and meticulous manner. With the great promotion of this Marxist-Leninist style, we will surely complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan and seize new and greater victories in socialist construction!

### 切切实实解决一个个的具体问题

　　切切实实解决一个个的具体问题
    据南京新华日报报道：南通钢铁厂产量不断增长后，矿石供应有时不能满足需要，成为全厂的薄弱环节。这个厂的领导干部深入现场，发现矿石供应不能满足需要，主要是由于矿石的破碎跟不上去；矿石的破碎跟不上去，又是由于破碎机容易损坏的缘故。为什么破碎机容易损坏呢？原来是生产管理上有些漏洞，应该送到开坯机去的大块矿石也送到破碎机去了，破碎机消化不了这样大块的矿石，因而常常发生故障。后来针对这种情况采取了具体措施，三天之内情况就改变了，矿石的班产量提高了一倍。
    看来，这只是一件很小的事情。但这件小事却道出了一个普遍的真理：任何工作都是由许许多多细小环节的协同动作组织起来的，有一个细小的环节抓得不紧，有一个具体问题没有解决，就可能影响全局的工作。把小块的矿石送到破碎机去，把大块的矿石送到开坯机去，这是一件多么具体、多么细小的事情！但是，这件事情没有办好，就影响到破碎机的正常运转，影响到矿石的破碎，最后影响到矿石不能及时供应，成为全厂生产的薄弱环节。把一个一个这样的具体问题解决了，把许许多多细小的环节都抓紧了，生产才能搞好。
    对于一个厂的生产说来是如此，对于整个国家的建设说来也是如此。我们要生产更多的钢，就要切实地抓紧煤、铁、矿、运各个环节；而煤、铁、矿、运各个环节，又都有各自的具体问题，需要切切实实地去解决。例如，为了加强矿山工作，就要具体地去解决矿山的采掘设备问题、深部开采的排水通风问题以及矿区的运输问题等等。我们要提高产品质量，生产第一流的产品，就要在全体职工中树立更高的质量观念，就要更加注意保持设备的良好性能，保证工卡具的精确度，提高工人的技术水平，就要有一套严密的专业检查和群众检查相结合的质量检查制度；而所有这些工作又都有许多具体问题，需要切切实实解决。例如，为了保持设备的良好性能，就要加强设备的维护检修，教育职工爱护设备，就要准备必要的备品等等。总之，任何一个目标的实现，任何一项工作的胜利，都有赖于我们切切实实、勤勤恳恳地去做艰苦细致的工作，有赖于把一个一个问题具体解决，把一个一个困难通通扳倒。“涓滴之水，汇成江河”，滔滔的江河是由点滴的水汇集起来的，我们事业的任何一项伟大胜利，也都是踏踏实实地解决了一个一个的具体问题，由许许多多细小的成就汇集起来的。
    这种踏踏实实地解决一个一个具体问题的作风，也就是我们党和毛泽东同志一贯倡导的把雄心壮志和踏实苦干结合起来，把在战略上藐视敌人和在战术上重视敌人结合起来的马克思列宁主义的作风。科学社会主义赋予共产党人敢于藐视一切敌人，在旧世界的废墟上建设一个崭新的社会的雄心壮志。革命的艰巨性和斗争的曲折性，又规定了共产党人必须踏踏实实地埋头苦干，切切实实地解决一个一个具体问题，才能完成自己的历史使命。所谓踏踏实实地埋头苦干，解决一个一个具体问题，就是实事求是，对具体问题进行具体分析和具体解决。什么叫实事求是？毛泽东同志说：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”这就是说，我们做任何事情都要对具体情况进行具体分析，从实际出发，使主观符合于客观，根据客观事物所固有的规律性来计划自己的行动。这种具体地分析具体的情况，就是列宁所说的“马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义的活的灵魂”，毛泽东同志曾经不止一次地引用列宁的这些话来教育我们。我们知道，工作中的问题就是尚待解决的矛盾，而矛盾都是具体的。只有实事求是，踏踏实实，对具体情况进行具体分析，才能掌握各种事物的矛盾的特殊性，具体地解决一个一个的问题，使我们的雄心壮志得到实现。
    在长期革命斗争和建设的实践中，这种把雄心壮志和踏实苦干结合起来，把在战略上藐视敌人和在战术上重视敌人结合起来的实事求是的马克思列宁主义的作风，已经成为我们全党的作风，成为党的优良传统。这是我们能够在革命斗争中和能够在生产建设事业的发展中不断取得胜利的重要原因。现在，我国的社会主义建设已经进入一个新的历史阶段，即国民经济的发展又有大跃进的高速度又有有计划的按比例的阶段。这个新的历史阶段的开始，意味着我们已经找到了一条适合我国具体情况的马克思列宁主义的建设社会主义的道路。在这条康庄大道上，我们的生产建设事业的规模越来越大了，要求也越来越高了。拿整个国民经济来说，两年多来大跃进的丰富实践，已经使国民经济各个部门互相促进、互相制约的内在联系，更加充分地展现在我们面前，要求我们更加深入地掌握它的发展的规律性，切切实实地抓紧国民经济的各个方面，首先是抓紧农业。就每一个工矿企业来说，两年多来的大跃进，也已经创造了极其有利的条件，使得我们可以提出更高的目标，朝着产量更高、质量更好、品种更多、成本更低的方向前进。这种新的形势，要求我们更加发扬踏实苦干的作风，把工作做得深些、更深些，细些、更细些。只有这样，才能适应新的形势，才能及时解决新的问题，把我们从胜利引向胜利。
    现在群众的觉悟很高，干劲很大，党的每一个号召都能迅速变为群众的自觉行动，因而工作的条件比过去任何时期都更好了。但是，正因为条件很好，我们就更不能疏忽大意，简单从事，就更要特别强调踏踏实实具体解决问题的作风，否则，虽有好的条件，也不能作出理想中的成绩。作风对于生产，不是某一个时期有影响、某一个时期没有影响，因而可以有时候注意，有时候不注意的。作风问题，作为意识形态、思想方法，属于上层建筑的范畴。上层建筑是对经济基础经常起作用的。我们要永远发扬马克思列宁主义的工作作风，工作更加好做了不是可以忽视这种作风，而是要更加发扬这种作风。
    也许有人觉得，一个一个的具体问题都要去切切实实地解决，是不是有些事务主义、有些手工业方式？是的，事务主义和手工业方式的作风是要不得的。沾染了这种作风的同志，往往把工作中的问题平列起来，不分轻重缓急，不善于首先集中力量解决关键性的问题，使其他问题迎刃而解，也不善于发动群众大家来做工作；而是事无巨细，一概揽在身上，结果忙忙碌碌，解决不了什么问题。大跃进以来，抓政治、抓思想、抓关键的问题引起了普遍的注意，种种群众路线的新的工作方法也得到普遍的推行，事务主义和手工业方式的作风是愈来愈少了。这是工作作风和工作方法上的一个大跃进。但是，抓政治、抓思想、抓带有普遍性的问题并不等于就可以忽视业务性的、具体的、个别的问题。而我们所说的业务性的、具体的、个别的问题，也并不是无关紧要的问题，而往往是一些具体工作中的重要问题，这些问题不解决，就阻碍了生产的前进。政治和业务是对立的统一，政治工作是一切业务工作的统帅，又是为技术、业务等经济工作服务的。抓政治、抓思想，正是为了更好地解决一个一个具体的技术问题、业务问题。一般和个别也是对立的统一。抓住一般性的问题，是为了解决一个一个的个别问题；从一个一个个别问题的研究和解决中，又可以取得经验，更好地指导一般。可见，踏踏实实地解决一个一个的具体问题，完全不同于事务主义、手工业方式，而是一般和个别相结合的、具体问题具体解决的马克思列宁主义的作风。
    1960年已经过去了半个年头。这半年中，我们在工业战线上又取得了新的重大的胜利。伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动把我们的生产提高到了一个新的水平。摆在我们面前的任务，就是要再接再厉，乘胜前进，在下半年取得比上半年更大的成就，力争高产、优质、多品种、低成本，全面完成和超额完成国家计划。现在，各级领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线。深入生产第一线以后怎样做工作呢？最重要的就是以身作则，用雄心壮志和踏实苦干相结合、战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人相结合的实事求是的作风，把全体职工动员起来，组织全体职工踏踏实实地、深入地、细致地去解决一个一个的具体问题。有了这种马克思列宁主义作风的大发扬，我们就一定能完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，夺取社会主义建设的新的更伟大的胜利！
