Zhengzhou, July 25th (This newspaper) – The industrial front in Anyang City, Henan Province, aiming at the key and weak links in production, vigorously promoted more than 50 effective advanced experiences, greatly consolidating and expanding the achievements of the technical revolution and promoting a sustained leap forward in production.

On the iron and steel front, 70% of the small blast furnaces have been technically transformed, and the utilization coefficient has generally increased by more than one time compared with half a year ago. After the machinery industry implemented the new process of non-cutting processing, it greatly saved processing man-hours and raw materials. For example, each 150 kg air hammer saves 40% of processing man-hours compared with the past, and raw material consumption and production costs are reduced by 18.2% and 45.35% respectively. The light industry and chemical industry have adopted new technologies and new techniques to vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and have increased many new products. Fifteen factories have basically achieved "four-no's" production, namely, no waste liquid, no waste material, no waste gas, and no waste residue.

The large-scale promotion, popularization, and improvement of advanced experiences on the industrial front in Anyang City are guided by ideological revolution. In March, when the Anyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party selected more than 50 major experiences from a dazzling array of technical innovation projects and decided to vigorously promote them, some ideological obstacles existed among some cadres and workers. One was blind complacency, unwilling to humbly learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal units. Another was a lack of enthusiastic support for new things. Some technical innovation projects were not rapidly promoted because they were not perfect enough or encountered resistance from habitual forces. Still others had the idea of ​​valuing foreign things over local ones, and looked down on indigenous innovations and creations, and so on. In view of these situations, the Municipal Party Committee believes that promoting technical innovation and technical revolution through large-scale promotion should also start with a more in-depth ideological revolution in people's minds. The Municipal Party Committee immediately organized all the workers in the city to launch a vigorous study campaign on "How Should Marxists View New Things." In the study, the masses were mobilized to speak out freely and debate extensively, criticizing and overcoming various erroneous ideas, greatly improving the awareness and determination of all cadres and workers to promote, popularize, and improve the results of technical innovation, and actively and proactively participating in this movement. After checking the blindly complacent mood, metallurgical enterprises sent people to visit and study in other places, and after returning, they vigorously built magnetic separators and created artificial rich ore, so that blast furnaces could eat fine materials. The city's pig iron production in May increased by 22.64% compared with April, and increased again in June compared with May.

On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of workers, the Municipal Party Committee further adopted strong organizational measures to vigorously promote the work of promoting advanced experiences with a revolutionary attitude. All industries have established advanced experience promotion headquarters, advanced experience promotion service teams, and key problem solving teams, etc. The Municipal Party Committee also transferred 200 cadres to form 16 working groups to help work in all walks of life. Aiming at the backward link of dyeing and finishing in the textile industry, the experience of Anyang Underwear Factory in developing dyeing and finishing mechanization through indigenous methods was vigorously promoted, and more than 350 dyeing and finishing workers were quickly freed from heavy manual labor. The workers praised the large-scale promotion and complete sets as "one flower blooming and a hundred flowers red, one treasure becoming a treasure for a hundred families."

In the large-scale promotion, many cases of surpassing the older generation also appeared on the industrial front in Anyang City. When promoting the "60" bricklaying method, construction workers not only learned advanced operating methods such as three-brick parallel laying and three-brick separate laying, but also created new experiences such as four-brick and six-brick continuous laying, which further improved the efficiency of bricklaying.

    思想革命作前导　组织措施抓得紧
    安阳推广先进经验成果丰硕
    本报郑州25日电　河南省安阳市工业战线针对生产关键和薄弱环节，雷厉风行地推广五十多项行之有效的先进经验，大大巩固和扩大了技术革命成果，促进生产持续跃进。
    钢铁战线已对70％的小高炉进行了技术改造，利用系数比半年前普遍提高一倍以上。机械行业推行无切削加工新工艺以后，大大节省了加工工时和原材料。如一百五十公斤空气锤每台加工工时比过去节约40％，原材料消耗和生产成本分别降低18.2％、45.35％。轻工、化工行业采用新工艺新技术大搞原材料综合利用，增加了许多新产品。有十五家工厂基本实现了无废液、无废料、无废气、无废渣的“四无”生产。
    安阳市工业战线的先进经验大推广、大普及、大提高，是以思想革命作前导的。3月份，当中共安阳市委从琳琅满目的技术革新项目中选出五十多项重大经验决定大力推广时，在部分干部和职工中存在着一些思想障碍。一种是盲目自满，不肯虚心学习兄弟单位的先进经验。一种是对新生事物热情支持不够，有的技术革新项目因为还不够完善或者遇到习惯势力的阻碍，便没有迅速推广。还有人有重洋轻土的思想，看不起土法上马的革新创造，等等。根据这些情况，市委认为，通过大推广来进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，也要先在人们思想上来一次更加深入的思想大革命。市委立即组织全市职工开展了一次大张旗鼓的“马克思主义者应当如何看待新生事物”的学习运动。学习中发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，批判和克服了各种错误思想，大大提高了全体干部和职工对推广、普及和提高技术革新成果的自觉性和坚定性，积极主动地投入这一运动。冶金企业检查了盲目自满情绪以后，派人到外地参观学习，回来以后便大造磁选机，大搞人造富矿，让高炉吃精料。全市5月份生铁产量比4月份增长22.64％，6月比5月又有所增长。
    在职工思想认识提高的基础上，市委进一步采取了强有力的组织措施，以革命的态度大抓先进经验的推广工作。各行业都成立了先进经验推广指挥部、推广先进经验服务队、攻尖队等。市委还抽调了二百名干部组成十六个工作组到各行各业帮助工作。纺织业针对漂染工种这一落后环节，大力推广安阳内衣厂土法上马搞漂染机械化的经验，很快使三百五十多名漂染工人摆脱了笨重的手工劳动。工人们歌颂大推广、大配套是“一家开花百家红，一宝变成百家宝”。
    安阳市工业战线在大推广中还出现了许多青出于蓝而胜于蓝的事例。建筑工人在推广“六○”砌砖法时，不仅学会了三砖并砌、三砖分砌等先进操作方法，还创造了四砖、六砖连砌等新经验，使砌砖效率又提高了一步。
