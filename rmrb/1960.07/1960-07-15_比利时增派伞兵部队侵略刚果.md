　　Xinhua News Agency, July 14th dispatch from Brussels: Supported by U.S. imperialism, the Belgian government, disregarding the just condemnation of the people of the world, insists on continuing its barbarous armed intervention in the Congo.
    According to an announcement made by the Belgian authorities last night, four more paratrooper companies will be airlifted to the Congo today to reinforce the Belgian invading forces that are being heavily beaten by the Congolese army and people. Thus, since Belgium began its armed suppression in the Congo, the Belgian reinforcements airlifted to the Congo have reached twenty-three companies, totaling more than 3,500 people.
    On the same day, the Belgian cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in the Congo. After the meeting, the Belgian Minister of Defense, Gilson, brazenly announced:
  “The efforts of the Belgian troops in the Congo will continue.”
    On the 12th, the Belgian cabinet also met to hear a report from General Janssens, the former Belgian commander-in-chief of the Congolese army who was driven out by the Congolese people, on the situation in the Congo. On the same day, the office of Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens issued a communique on the situation in the Congo, admitting that the situation in the Congo was "very tense." The communique said that the Belgian Minister for African Affairs, Van der Meersch, who is currently in the Congo, has flown to the "disturbed areas" of Lower Congo. The communique revealed that this Belgian minister is exerting strong pressure on the Congolese government, attempting to force the Congo to make a "formal request for Belgian troop intervention."
    The Belgian Ambassador to the Congo, Vandenbosch, yesterday blatantly clamored that the Belgian government might consider "taking over" power in the Congo. At a press conference held in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, he described the Belgian army's bloody suppression of the Congolese people's anti-colonialist patriotic demonstrations as carrying out some "international obligation" to "maintain order." He threatened that if the Congo could not fulfill this "obligation" on its own territory, it would be responsible for "requesting" others to do so; and if the Congo did not make such a "request," the Belgian government might consider "replacing" the Congolese government itself.
    Currently, due to the heroic resistance of the Congolese army against the invaders, the armed suppression by the Belgian colonialists has been repeatedly frustrated. Therefore, while the Belgian government is making every effort to strengthen its military and political interventionist pressure on the Congo, it is also seeking further support from the United States. Reports say that the Belgian Embassy in the United States has been maintaining close contact with the U.S. State Department for this purpose.

### 比利时增派伞兵部队侵略刚果

　　比利时增派伞兵部队侵略刚果
    据新华社14日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：在美帝国主义的支持下，比利时政府不顾世界人民的正义谴责，坚持要继续对刚果进行野蛮的武装干涉。
    据比利时当局昨天晚上宣布，又有四个伞兵连将在今天空运到刚果去，增援在那里遭到刚果军民痛击的比利时侵略军。这样，自从比利时在刚果开始武装镇压以来，空运到刚果的比利时增援部队已经达到二十三个连，共三千五百多人。
    同一天，比利时内阁召开了紧急会议，讨论刚果局势。会后，比利时国防大臣纪耳松悍然宣布：
  “在刚果的比利时军队的努力将继续下去。”
    比利时内阁在12日还开会听取了被刚果人民赶出来的前刚果军比籍总司令让桑将军关于刚果形势的报告。当天，比利时首相伊斯更斯的办公厅就刚果局势发表了公报，承认刚果的形势“十分紧张”。公报说，目前正在刚果的比利时非洲事务大臣范德梅什已经飞往下刚果的“骚乱地区”。公报透露，这个比利时大臣正在向刚果政府施行强大压力，企图迫使刚果提出“请比利时军队干涉”的“正式请求”。
    比利时驻刚果大使范登博斯什昨天公然叫嚣说，比利时政府可能考虑“接管”刚果的权力。他在刚果首都利奥波德维尔举行的记者招待会上把比利时军队血腥镇压刚果人民的反殖民主义爱国示威说成是执行什么“维持秩序”的“国际义务”。他威胁说，如果刚果不能履行它在自己领土上的这种“义务”，它就有责任“请求”别人来这样做；而如果刚果不提出这样的“请求”，比利时政府也许就要考虑由自己来“代替”刚果政府。
    目前，由于刚果军队的英勇抗击侵略者，比利时殖民主义者的武装镇压不断遭到挫折。因此，比利时政府在竭力加强它对刚果的军事、政治干涉压力的同时，还在争取美国进一步撑腰。有消息说，比利时驻美大使馆为此一直同美国国务院保持密切的联系。
