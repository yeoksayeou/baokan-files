Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Henan Province, one of China's main cotton-producing areas, is intensifying cotton field management during the peak flowering and boll formation stage, launching a high-yield competition centered on high-yield plots. The main content of the competition includes cotton cultivation, topdressing, and pest control, striving for every cotton plant to have its branches full of bolls and have autumn bolls covering the top.

In the competition, various regions have conscientiously summarized past experiences in achieving high cotton yields and, in light of the current growth situation, have taken measures to promote more boll setting, larger boll setting, and reduced boll shedding or no boll shedding. Farmers in Xinxiang, Kaifeng, and other regions have adopted late ridging and deep cultivation methods for cotton fields with dense branches and leaves to prevent the growth of superfluous buds. They have also adopted alternating-row topping and layered old-leaf removal methods to solve ventilation and light transmission problems. From the province to the county and commune levels, on-site observation and evaluation meetings for promoting cotton field management experience have also been held, thereby greatly improving cotton field management techniques.

In cotton field management, various regions have also paid special attention to the reform of various tools.

Currently, the entire province is deploying more than 1.5 million laborers for cotton field management every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 24: Wu Chun'an, a national model cotton planter from the Xiliang Farm in Chengguan People's Commune, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, combined with local technicians and experienced farmers to innovate cotton field management techniques, resulting in universally healthy and robust seedlings, numerous branches, short nodes, and abundant bolls and peaches in all 1,000 mu of cotton fields on the farm.

Based on this year's prolonged drought and dense seedlings, Wu Chun'an and the technicians and experienced farmers carried out several technical innovations to increase and protect buds and bolls:

1.  In terms of cultivation techniques, in previous years, deep cultivation was generally carried out when cotton plants grew to the bud stage. However, this approach is only suitable for irrigated land and years with heavy rain. Since the beginning of this year, rainfall has been scarce, and the drought has been severe, resulting in a high demand for water in the cotton fields. Based on this characteristic, they have implemented more cultivation, fine cultivation, and shallow cultivation (about five fen) methods.

2.  In terms of topdressing techniques, based on past experiences and lessons learned that cotton plants cannot continue to grow buds and bolls due to fertilizer deficiency; and excessive topdressing can cause excessive growth or boll shedding, this year, they have changed three topdressings to five topdressings, applying fertilizer separately during the seedling stage, bud stage, flowering stage, and boll stage. The topdressing methods have also been improved. In the past, regardless of the type of land, more phosphorus was applied first, followed by more nitrogen. Now, it has been changed to more phosphorus in the early stage and more nitrogen in the later stage for irrigated land, rain-prone land, or land with high soil moisture, and more nitrogen in the early stage and more phosphorus in the later stage for dry land or land with low soil moisture.

3.  In terms of irrigation techniques, based on the characteristics of this year's lack of rainfall, the past practice of shallow and frequent watering has been changed to alternate-furrow watering, ditch watering, and soil-covered ditch watering. In addition, watering is carried out based on the weather, the land, and the seedlings. Cotton plants are watered approximately every five days during the bud stage, every seven days during the initial flowering stage, and every eight days during the boll stage. This saves water and prevents drought and waterlogging.

4.  In terms of pest control techniques, single-item pest control has been changed to comprehensive prevention and control, eliminating various pests together.

    加强开花结铃盛期的棉田管理
    河南以丰产方为中心开展棉花增产竞赛
    山西翼城县城关公社革新增蕾保铃技术
    据新华社郑州讯　我国主要产棉区之一的河南省，正抓紧棉花开花结铃盛期，开展以丰产方为中心的棉花中耕、追肥、灭虫为主要内容的丰产比赛运动，力争棵棵棉花伏桃满腰、秋桃盖顶。
    在竞赛运动中，各地都认真地总结了过去棉花丰产的经验，针对当前生长情况，采取措施，促使棉花多座桃、座大桃，少落铃或不落铃。新乡、开封等专区的农民，对枝叶密茂的棉田，采取晚封垅、深中耕的办法，防止生长赘芽；并采取隔行打顶和分层打老叶的办法，解决通风透光问题。从省到县和公社，还分别召开了推广棉田管理经验的现场参观评比会，因而，大大提高了棉田管理技术。
    各地在棉田管理工作中，还特别注意各种工具的改革。
    现在，全省每天投入棉田管理的劳力达一百五十多万人。
    据新华社太原24日电　山西省翼城县城关人民公社西梁农场的全国植棉模范吴春安，和当地技术人员、老农相结合，革新了棉田管理技术，使全场一千亩棉田普遍长得苗全苗壮、枝多节短、铃多桃多。
    吴春安和技术人员与老农们，根据今年久旱和苗密等新情况，在增保蕾铃上进行几项技术革新：
    一、在中耕技术上，历年棉株生长到蕾期，一般要进行深中耕。但这种做法只适合水地和雨涝年头。今年以来，这里雨水稀少，干旱严重，棉田需水量大，他们根据这个特点，就实行多中耕、细中耕、浅中耕（五分左右）的办法。
    二、在追肥技术上，根据以往棉花缺肥，不能继续生长蕾、铃；追肥过多，又发生狂长或引起落蕾落铃的经验教训，今年，他们变三次追肥为五次追肥，并分别在苗期、蕾期、花期、铃期施肥。追肥方法也做了改进。过去不管什么土地都采用先多磷，后多氮，现在改为水地、雨涝地或墒大地前期多磷，后期多氮，旱地或墒小的地，前期多氮，后期多磷。
    三、灌溉技术上，根据今年缺少雨水的特点，变过去浅浇勤浇为隔垅、开沟浇、培土沟浇。并实行看天、看地、看苗浇水。棉株在现蕾期五天左右浇一次，初花期七天浇一次，铃期八天浇一次。这样，既省水又防旱涝。
    四、在治虫技术上，变单项治虫为综合防治，把各种虫害一起消灭。
