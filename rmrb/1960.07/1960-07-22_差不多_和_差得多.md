    “Almost” and “Far From Enough”
    Worker of the Jiancheng Machinery Factory, Xu Jiajun
    Currently, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, centered on the "Four Modernizations," is developing at a rapid pace, wave upon wave. In this excellent moment, one occasionally hears such statements as: "Technological innovation and technological revolution have been done almost enough," "Further deepening would probably be very difficult," and so on. Although there are not many people with this kind of thinking or saying this, we cannot underestimate them. Because these people want to stay put or stop moving forward, which becomes an obstacle to our rapid progress.
    We all know that things are constantly developing and changing, and there is nothing that is unchanging or static. What seems to be "almost enough" now will, after some time, not only be not "almost enough" but also "far from enough." Take our factory's large-scale "chipless processing" as an example: when about 50 percent of the parts of the 201-type electric vehicle were realized through chipless processing, some people thought, "For such a complex product, achieving 50 percent chipless processing is almost enough." However, after the factory Party committee thoroughly criticized this "almost enough" thinking, the vast number of workers, with only ten days of hard work, increased the degree of chipless processing of the 201-type electric vehicle from 50 percent to more than 90 percent, creating the first chipless-processed electric vehicle and creating a new achievement in the mechanical industry's chipless processing. From this, it can be seen that everything that is "almost enough" will gradually become "far from enough" as time goes on. If we want to move forward continuously and make revolution continuously, we must eliminate the "almost enough" thinking so that we can ride forward and continue to leap forward.
    Is our technological innovation and technological revolution really done "almost enough"? In fact, this is not the case. Of course, we do not deny the great achievements made in technological innovation and technological revolution, nor do we deny that today's science and technology are much more advanced and progressive than in the past. However, we must never think that it is "almost enough" because of this, thereby becoming arrogant, complacent, and stagnant. In fact, the achievements we have made in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement are far from enough compared to what we need to do! For example, the consolidation, promotion, development, and improvement of advanced technologies and advanced experiences, the upgrading of the "Four Modernizations," the issue of one machine with multiple functions and one line with multiple uses, the issue of comprehensive utilization, and so on. In these areas, what we have done is not "almost enough," but "far from enough." Even if we fully realize automation, we will still need to develop in higher directions and will still be "far from enough." Since it is "far from enough," then we must not only work and make revolution, but also constantly work and constantly make revolution.
    We must use Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution to arm our minds and never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We must thoroughly eliminate the "almost enough" thinking so that the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement, centered on the "Four Modernizations," can develop more vigorously and endlessly.

    “差不多”和“差得多”
    建成机械厂工人  徐家骏
    目前，以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以瞬息万变之势，一浪高一浪地向前发展着。在这个大好时刻里，偶尔也听到这样一种说法：“技术革新、技术革命搞得差不多了”，“再深入恐怕就很困难了”等等。有这种想法或说法的人，虽然为数不多，可也不能小看他们。因为，这些人想就地不动，或者说想勒马不前，这就成为我们飞速前进中的一种障碍。
    我们都知道，事物是不断发展变化的，不变的、不动的东西是没有的。现在看来是“差不多”的东西，过了一些时候，就不仅不是“差不多”，而且是“差得多”的。就拿我厂大搞“无屑加工”来说，就是这样：当二○一型电瓶车，有百分之五十左右的部件实现无屑加工时，有人认为，“这么复杂的产品，实现百分之五十无屑加工，差不多了”。可是，当厂党委彻底批判了这种“差不多”的思想以后，广大职工仅苦战了十天，就使二○一型电瓶车无屑加工的程度，由百分之五十跃到百分之九十以上，造成了第一台无屑加工的电瓶车，使机械工业出现了无屑加工的新成就。由此可见，一切“差不多”的东西，随着时间的推移，也会逐渐地变为“差得多”的。我们要不断前进、不断革命，就必须扫除“差不多”的思想，这样才能纵马向前，继续跃进。
    我们的技术革新、技术革命是不是真的搞得“差不多”了呢？事实上，也并不是这样。当然，我们不否认在技术革新和技术革命中取得的伟大成就，也不否认今天的科学技术比起过去是高级得多，进步得多了。可是，绝不能因此以为“差不多”了，从而骄傲自满，停滞不前。其实，我们在技术革新、技术革命运动中所取得的成绩，和我们要做的事情比较起来，还差得很多呢！比如：先进技术、先进经验的巩固、推广、发展和提高的问题，“四化”升级的问题，一机多能、一线多用的问题，综合利用的问题等等。在这些方面，我们做的不是“差不多”，而是还“差得多”。就是我们全部实现了自动化，也还要向更高的方向发展，还会是“差得多”。既然“差得多”，那末，我们就不仅要干、要革命，而且应该不断地干、不断地革命。
    我们必须用毛主席的不断革命的思想，武装我们的头脑，永远也不要满足既得的成绩，彻底扫除“差不多”的思想，这样才能使当前的以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，更加蓬勃地，永无止境地向前发展。
