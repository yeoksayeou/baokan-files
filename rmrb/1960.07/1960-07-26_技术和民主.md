	Technology and Democracy
	Chen Zhiyan

	What is the relationship between technology and democracy? On the surface, it seems that there is no relationship. Mechanization and automation are technical issues, while democracy is a style, thought, and system within the scope of people's political life and the superstructure. On the surface, there is indeed no direct connection between the two. But this is only on the surface. If we delve into the inherent connections of things, the relationship between the two is very close. Look, the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard, precisely because it fully promoted democracy in technical issues, resulted in the normal usage rate of technological innovation projects rising from 68% to 95%. Can you say that the relationship between the two is not close?

	We often say that any new thing is never in a smooth situation when it is first born. Why? Because people do not yet fully understand and master its laws. In many enterprises, some of the achievements of technological innovation have not been used normally in the process of universal promotion. An important reason is that these new technologies themselves are not perfect enough, that is, they do not fully conform to objective laws. Therefore, problems may occur when they are used. And the creators of these new technologies cannot fully understand its laws all at once. In this case, it depends on what attitude and method the leaders adopt. Either retreat in the face of difficulties, and let these new technologies enter the "cold palace," or submit the problems (faults, difficulties) to the masses, fully promote democracy, and fully draw on collective wisdom. Every person's bit of wisdom helps people understand and master the laws of new technologies. The bits of wisdom of many people added together may basically recognize and master the laws of new technologies, so that the achievements of each project of technological innovation can be consolidated, promoted, and improved. The Shanghai Hudong Shipyard adopted the latter attitude and the latter method, and therefore achieved good results.

	But to achieve this, it is impossible without fully trusting the views of the masses. Some people, although they say they believe in the masses, do not really believe that the masses can solve some complex technical problems. If this kind of thinking is not cleared, it is impossible to truly promote technical democracy.

	Promoting democracy, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and promoting new technologies in technical issues are also manifestations of politics commanding technology. Politics commanding technology, and solving technical problems politically, does not mean using general political principles to solve technical problems, but means using the mass line method to promote the creativity of the masses and overcome technical barriers.

	The relationship between technology and democracy is such a relationship.

    技术和民主
    陈之衍
    技术和民主有什么关系呢？从表面上去看，似乎没有什么关系。机械化也好，自动化也好，都是一种技术性的问题，而民主则是人们政治生活、上层建筑范围内的一种作风、思想和制度，两者在表面上确是没有什么直接的关联。可是这只是在表面上。如果从事物的内在联系去深究一下，两者的关系却密切得很。你看，上海沪东造船厂，就是因为在技术问题上也充分发扬了民主，结果技术革新项目的正常使用率从68％上升到95％，能说两者的关系不密切吗？
    我们常说，任何一项新事物，在它刚刚诞生的时候，处境总不是那样顺利的。为什么？因为人们对它的规律还没有完全认识和完全掌握。在许多企业里，技术革新的成果，在普遍推广的过程中，都有一些项目，还没有能正常使用。一个重要的原因，就是这些新技术本身，还不够完善，也就是还不完全符合客观规律，因此使用起来，就可能出现这样那样的一些毛病。而这些新技术的创造者，一下又不可能完全认识它的规律。在这种情况下，就看领导者采取什么态度和方法了。或者见难而退，让这些新技术进入“冷宫”，或者把问题（毛病、困难）提交给群众，充分发扬民主，充分集思广益。每个人的点滴智慧都有助于人们认识、掌握新技术的规律，许多人的点滴智慧加在一起，就有可能基本上认识和掌握新技术的规律，使技术革新的每个项目的成果，都能得到巩固、推广和提高。上海沪东造船厂就是采取了后一种态度，后一种方法，因而获得了良好的效果。
    可是要做到这一点，没有充分相信群众的观点是办不到的。有些人尽管口头上也说相信群众，但是内心里还是不大相信群众能够解决一些复杂的技术问题。这种思想不清除，是不可能真正发扬什么技术民主的。
    在技术问题上，发扬民主，集中群众的智慧，推广新技术，这也是政治统率技术的表现。政治统率技术，技术问题，政治解决，并不是指用一般的政治原则去解决技术问题，而是指通过群众路线的方法，发扬群众的创造力，攻破技术关。
    技术和民主的关系，就是这样一种关系。
