    Growing Our Own Vegetables for Ourselves
    Since the beginning of this year, all the workers in our Third Workshop have been successfully completing production tasks every month. In terms of daily life, we also implement the Party's principle of "relying mainly on self-reliance," and improve our lives by producing things ourselves. Our entire workshop, consisting of over two hundred people, uses some of our spare time to grow more than thirty mu of sweet potatoes, cassava, taro, peanuts, and melons and vegetables, and we have already weeded and fertilized them. Every time we see the lush green crops we planted ourselves, we are indescribably happy. Especially when we eat the melons and vegetables we grew with our own hands, we feel that they are particularly fresh and delicious.
    Now, all the workers in our workshop regard sideline production as a very meaningful labor that adjusts our lives. Comrades all say: When we start up the machines, we are workers; when we pick up the hoes, we are farmers. In order to do a good job in sideline production and assist the cafeteria in running the meals well, the entire workshop is preparing to have a big competition in sideline production as well.

    自己种菜自己吃
    我们三车间的全体职工，从今年年初开始，月月都出色地完成了生产任务。在生活方面，我们也贯彻党提出的“以自力更生为主”的方针，自己动手生产来改善生活。我们全车间二百多人，利用部分业余时间，种了三十多亩红薯、木薯、芋头、花生和瓜菜等，已经锄了草、施了肥。每当我们看到自己种的绿油油的庄稼时，真是说不出来的高兴。尤其是吃到自己亲手种的瓜菜时，更感到特别新鲜可口。
    现在我们车间的全体职工已把副业生产看成是调剂生活的很有意义的劳动。同志们都说：我们开起机器来是个工人，拿起锄头来就是农民。大家为了搞好副业生产，协助食堂办好伙食，全车间正准备在副业生产上也来个大竞赛。　　（杨建宁）
