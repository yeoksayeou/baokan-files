    Go to Practical Work to Solve Problems
    Gao Hanzhang, Secretary of the Fanjiatun People's Commune Committee, Huaide County, Jilin Province
    On the morning of June 21st, it rained. As soon as the rain stopped, the commune members picked up their hoes, put on their plows, and rushed to the fields, braving the mud to rush to hoe and cultivate. Comrade Cui Cishan, the commune's agricultural assistant, and I were on our way from the first production team of the Pingdingshan Management Area to the second production team, preparing to participate in tractor inter-row cultivation. At this time, the tractor driver was busy starting the engine, and the sound of the engine attracted the commune members to gather around the tractor. Why did they come so quickly? Because the provincial and county committees issued instructions to rush hoeing and cultivating, and these instructions became the driving force for their practical actions. Every commune member knows that summer hoeing and cultivating is a crucial moment for winning a bumper agricultural harvest, and we must race against time and not give up an inch of land. With tractors, we must work even harder to speed up the progress.
    After the Fanjiatun People's Commune in Huaide County acquired tractors, the commune members' spirit of daring to think and act, and actively creating, was further brought into play, boldly reforming tools. The commune members of the second production team discussed tool reform during inter-row cultivation. The more they reformed, the more refined it became, and the more detailed the research. Some people even wrote poems praising it: "The tractor is really good, the driver sits on top, no one runs on the ground, sitting in the car and holding the plow, the progress is fast and the efficiency is high, good cattle and horses can't compare." Yin Changgui, the leader of the machine cultivation team, happily drove the tractor to a field of fertile and strong sorghum seedlings to the west of his home, and began inter-row cultivation. Comrade Cui Cishan and I got on the plow car with the commune members and held the plows. After several rounds of work, we discovered the problems of the machine crushing seedlings and the cultivating plow covering seedlings when the machine turned. So we discussed solutions with the commune members and drivers on the spot. Some commune members said that the machine and the plow car were so long when connected that it was inevitable to crush the seedlings when turning at the end of the field. Yin Changgui continued, "This problem is easy to solve, change the small turn to a large turn, and cultivate in a rotating manner so as not to crush the seedlings." After he finished speaking, he tried it, and the seedlings were not crushed. The problem of the plow covering seedlings was debated endlessly. Some said, "The machine crushing seedlings is easy to solve, but this covering of seedlings is difficult to handle." We found a solution to the problem of covering seedlings during the plowing process. We introduced to the commune members that when plowing, the plow should be active, so that the soil is evenly distributed and does not cover the seedlings. Comrade Yin Changgui said that another method is to pay attention to the places where the seedlings are large and the places where the seedlings are small when driving, and use a small throttle in the places with small seedlings and a large throttle in the places with large seedlings, and with frequent adjustments to the plow, the problem of covering seedlings can be solved. After testing, this problem was also solved.
    Because the ridges are short, frequent turning of the car results in a lot of empty running, which wastes time and fuel and lowers work efficiency. The driver raised this issue, and I discussed it with the commune members again. Commune member Wang Zhenfa said, "I have a good idea, which is to open up the team boundaries, connect what can be connected, and join what can be joined, so that there will be less moving and less turning." Commune member Old Sun said, "If the ridges are longer, there will be less turning, but isn't that working for other teams?" Before Wang Zhenfa could finish speaking, he took over and said, "We also have to have a spirit of cooperation! If only the second team has a bumper harvest, and the other teams have less grain, we will also have less income!" The commune members participating in the inter-row cultivation all said in unison that it was a good idea, and the short ridges were changed to long ridges. The land of the first production team at the junction was opened up for operation. It was really satisfying to cultivate a 600-meter-long ridge in one go. The output was high and the quality was good. Thirty-six hectares were cultivated in one day and one night, which was twice as high as last year's tractor-pulled plow with people running alongside the car.
    As long as you go deep into practical work and rely on the wisdom of the masses, you will definitely be able to discover problems in a timely manner and solve them in a timely manner.

    到实际工作中去解决问题
    中共吉林怀德县范家屯公社委员会书记　高汉章
    6月21日上午，下了一场雨。雨刚刚停下来，社员们便拿起锄头，套上犁仗，奔往田间，不顾泥泞突击抢铲抢趟去了。我和公社农业助理崔赐山同志从平顶山管理区第一生产队往第二生产队去，准备参加机车中耕作业。这时拖拉机驾驶员正在忙碌着起动机车，哒哒的马达声唤来了社员们齐聚在机车旁。他们为啥来的这么快呢？因为省委、县委发出了抢铲抢趟的指示，这个指示成为他们实际行动的力量。每个社员都知道夏锄铲趟是夺取农业大丰收关键性的时刻，必须分秒必争，寸土不让，有了拖拉机更得加劲干，才能加快进度。
    怀德县范家屯人民公社有了拖拉机之后，更加发挥了社员们敢想敢干积极创造的精神，大胆改革工具。第二生产队的社员们在中耕作业中讨论了工具改革，大家越改越精，越研究越细，有的人编了诗歌赞颂：“拖拉机真正好，驾驶员上边坐，谁也不在地下跑，坐在车上扶犁走，进度快工效高，好牛好马比不了。”机耕队长尹长贵同志乐呵呵地驾驶着拖拉机开往家西一片肥壮高粱苗地，开始中耕作业了。我和崔赐山同志同社员们一起上了扶犁车扶着犁仗，经过几个来回的作业，发现机车抹弯时轧苗和趟犁付土压苗的问题，于是我们就地同社员、驾驶员一起研究解决。有的社员说机车和扶犁车连在一起这么长，抹地头时非压苗不可。尹长贵接着说：“这个问题好解决，改小抹弯为大抹弯，旋着趟不轧苗”。说完了就试验，结果不轧苗了。付土压苗问题争论不休，有的说：“机车轧苗好解决，这个压苗不好办。”我们在扶犁过程中找到了解决压苗的办法。向社员介绍了扶犁时活动犁，上土均匀不压苗，尹长贵同志说再一个办法是开车注意庄稼苗大的地方和苗小的地方，可在小苗地方用小油门，大苗地方用大油门，加上勤活动犁，就可以不压苗了。经过试验之后，这个问题也解决了。
    因为垅短、勤抹车空运转多，费时间费油多，工效低。驾驶员提出了这个问题，我又和社员一起研究。社员王振发说：“我有一个好办法，就是打开队界，能接就接、能连就连，这样少挪地、少抹弯”。社员老孙头说：“垅长了少抹弯，不是给别的队干了吗？”王振发没等他说完，接过来说：“咱们也得有个协作的思想啊！光第二队丰收了，其它各队少打了粮食，咱们也少收哇！”参加中耕的社员异口同声说好，改短垅为长垅，接头的第一生产队的地通开作业了，六百米长的垅头干一趟真解渴，出活多质量好，一天一夜就中耕三十六公顷，比去年拖拉机牵引犁用人扶跟车跑提高二倍。
    只要你深入到实际工作中去，依靠群众的智慧，就一定能及时地发现问题，及时地解决问题。
