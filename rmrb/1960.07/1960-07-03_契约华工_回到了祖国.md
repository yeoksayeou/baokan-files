“Contract Laborers” Return to the Motherland
	Wang Jinxi

Since the end of last year, nearly a hundred "contract laborers" have returned to the embrace of their motherland, like fallen leaves returning to their roots. Along with hundreds of thousands of other overseas Chinese, they were slandered as "bloodsuckers" by powerful groups in Indonesia and driven back.

"Contract laborers" refers to Chinese laborers who were abducted and sold to various countries around the world by colonialists such as the United States and the Netherlands. They are usually called "pigs." "Pigs!" Just this name is enough to imagine the tragedy of their fate. Treating people as "pigs" is also a major crime of the imperialists in enslaving people.

The returning "contract laborers" are mostly over sixty years old, but their expressions and physical conditions make them seem even older. Heavy labor and a life of slavery have left scars on the bodies and minds of these old people. Some have gone blind, some have paralyzed legs, some have only one hand left, and some have become deaf. A common characteristic is that they do not like to talk. Thirty or forty years of swallowing their tears has made them accustomed to silence, accustomed to chewing on their pain, and never imagining that one day they could pour out their suffering.

However, stepping onto the land of the motherland, living in the warm rooms of the nursing home, and contacting so many reception staff who are closer than relatives, their long-frozen hearts melted, melted in the spring breeze of the motherland.

It was not the temptation of gold dreams, nor the impulse of curiosity, but entirely the ruthless whip of life in the old society that drove them to leave their homes. Liao Hong, a sixty-year-old miner, was originally a sand-turning apprentice in a small machinery factory in Guangzhou. In 1924, the factory closed down, and he had to sell himself for seven Hong Kong dollars, hiding it from his mother. Even more people, encountering natural disasters and crop failures, were still forced to pay rent by the landlords, so they had to go out to do odd jobs and finally reluctantly handed themselves over to the "pig brokers."

As soon as they put their fingerprints on the "pig contract" and received those seven or eight Hong Kong dollars, they became unfree cattle and horses, at the mercy of others, organized into groups, assigned numbers, and wore numbers on their chests. Some even had their heads shaved. Among the returning laborers, there are people named Ou Da, Mai Er, Zhong Si, Pang Wu, Tang Ba, Huang Jiu, Li Shi'er, and Lin Shi'wu; many of their names came from these numbers. Then, they were escorted on and off ships, on and off trains. The times for getting on and off the vehicles were all in the pitch-black night, so that they would forget the road back home and would not be able to escape in the future.

The contract clearly stated that the contract laborers must work a full 360 days for the Dutch colonialists in order to obtain a "release certificate" and redeem themselves. Yang Fengcai, a seventy-six-year-old miner, described that period: "Every morning at four o'clock, when the tin mine company's drum sounded, we were driven up, braving the piercing sea breeze, and forced to finish an unbearable cold bath. Then, endlessly, from the bottom of mine pits seventy to one hundred and twenty meters deep, we carried the tin ore up along narrow planks. If we didn't carry enough eight to ten cubic meters a day, we couldn't expect to return to the work shed safely. If we walked a little slower, the leather shoes and whips of the colonialists and their running dogs would constantly fall on you. If you carried a little less one day, in addition to being beaten, you would not be credited with the work, which would be equivalent to working for nothing. Therefore, no one could truly redeem themselves after only doing 360 days. Many people worked for several years, exhausted themselves to the point of coughing up blood, and even died without redeeming themselves."

Did "release" mean freedom?

"Release," other than slightly increasing wages, never meant gaining true freedom. After "release," empty-handed, they had to continue working to make a living. Looking at the "release certificates" brought back by these old people, it becomes clear that "release" did not free them from the fate of slaves. The first page of miner Wu Yu's "release certificate" has a photo. The person in the photo has a number, name, and the English abbreviation of the mine written on his chest, looking like a prisoner. The Wu Yu in the photo is young and energetic, making it hard to believe that he is the frail old man now at Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm. Turning the page, a whole page is a record of his work from 1931 to 1955. There are many columns, including daily wages, bonuses, illness, crime, escape, laziness, disobedience, going out, medicine, fighting, stealing, quarrels, breach of contract, and so on. In the twenty-four years of records, Wu Yu only received one bonus, while records of illness, laziness, etc., appeared every year, becoming more frequent in later years. These records meant more deductions in wages, hunger, and beatings. Through these few thin pieces of paper, the miserable life of the contract laborers is revealed.

Death was constantly prowling around these laborers, whether "released" or not. Falling and dying from those hundred-meter-high planks, being crushed to death by felled tree roots, being tortured to death by disease, being whipped to death by the colonialists... According to a very incomplete statistic, from 1931 to 1940, there were about 80,000 contract laborers in Indonesia. Few of these people were able to return alive; most had given their lives for the prosperity of Indonesia. Their white bones are everywhere in the mines of Bangka and Belitung, and in the rubber and tobacco plantations of Deli.

Many laborers, regardless of the threat of death, resisted and escaped. Li Jincai, an old laborer now in Guangxi, remembers that in 1922, a large number of laborers escaped from the Wen Island tin mine where he was working. The Dutch colonialists electrified the barbed wire around the mining area, and the escapees were electrocuted to death. Some laborers also felt that they had no way out and committed suicide. Old miner Huang Yahua still remembers those tragic stories: "Once, we were driven to take cold baths again. After washing, three of our workmates were missing; they had committed suicide."

Some people had made up their minds to work hard for a few years and save some money to jump out of this pit of fire. However, the wages were already low, and after deductions and fines, they couldn't get much money at all. In the end, the casinos and taverns would suck the last few drops of blood out of you. Liao Hong originally sold himself to earn money to support his mother. As a result, for thirty-seven years, he didn't send a single penny to his mother and couldn't return home. He wanted to start a family there, but a marriage certificate cost 100 yuan, and giving birth to a child cost 25 yuan. When the child reached sixteen, another 30 yuan had to be paid, or they would be arrested. Where could he find so much money! Liao Hong said: "I regret it. I dreamed of returning to my hometown, but I lost my freedom and couldn't even go to the market in Belinyu. Later, I drank and smoked. I spent thirty-seven years working, being beaten, smoking, and drinking! I ended up returning home with nothing." Li Sheng, a sixty-seven-year-old contract laborer, had a young wife and a newborn son when he went to Southeast Asia. He originally hoped to work there for three to five years and earn some money to support his family. Now, he has finally returned, but his wife has long since passed away, and if his son is still alive, he should be forty-five years old. He wants to find him but doesn't even know his name.

These old people have worked hard all their lives. Once they reached fifty-five, they were all dismissed according to the tin mine company's regulations. Where could they go after being dismissed? They had no savings, no one to rely on, and no money to return home. So, some went to the poor old people's homes run by overseas Chinese organizations, and some, at the risk of their lives, re-entered the barren mountains, relying on trapping wild animals and chopping wood to grow vegetables for a living. Recently, when they decided to brave the waves and head to their motherland, the powerful groups in Indonesia still wanted to collect various taxes from them, and even the last half kilogram of pepper and a few quinine pills for treating fever in their luggage were confiscated.

Some of these weathered contract laborers have been back for two or three months. News keeps coming that the old people have fallen in love with the nursing homes in the overseas Chinese farms, that the old people often care about whether the farm's pepper and coffee are growing well, that the old people have become talkative and cheerful, and that the old people often talk about Chairman Mao's kindness... It seems that a new life is slowly healing their wounds.

However, the matter is not over. News of persecution of overseas Chinese continues to come from overseas: the sound of gunfire killing overseas Chinese, the sound of clubs beating overseas Chinese, the roar of insults against overseas Chinese, but there is a voice louder than all of this. That is the voice of the contract laborers' accusations: "The land of Indonesia has sucked dry the blood and sweat of so many of us! Yet we are still called 'bloodsuckers'?" This voice, passionate and sonorous, full of grief and anger, shattered all the slanders of the anti-Chinese elements. (Attached picture)

### “契约华工”回到了祖国

    “契约华工”回到了祖国
    王瑾希
    从去年年底以来，先后有近百名的“契约华工”，落叶归根，回到了祖国的土地。他们和成千上万的华侨一起，被印度尼西亚有势力集团诬蔑为“吸血虫”，赶了回来。
    “契约华工”，指的是那些被美国、荷兰等殖民主义者拐卖到世界各国的中国劳动者。通常都叫“猪仔”。“猪仔”！单凭这个称呼，人们就可以想见他们命运的悲惨。把人当作“猪仔”，这也是帝国主义者奴役人民的一大罪证。
    回来的这些“契约华工”，绝大多数在六十岁以上，他们的神情、体态却比他们的年龄更加衰老。沉重的劳动，奴隶般的生活，在这些老人的身上、心上留下了累累伤痕。有的人已经双目失明，有的人双脚瘫痪，有的只剩下一只手，有的已经成了聋子。不爱说话是他们的共同特征。三、四十年饮泣吞声的生活，使他们习惯了沉默，习惯了咀嚼痛苦，而不曾想到还有一天可以倾诉痛苦。
    但是，踏上了祖国的土地，住进了敬老院温暖的房间，接触了那么多比亲人还要亲的接待人员，一颗颗久被冻结的心灵溶解了，在祖国的春风里溶解了。
    不是受黄金梦的诱惑，不是被好奇心所冲动，完全是旧社会的无情的生活鞭子，驱使他们背井离乡。六十多岁的矿工廖洪，原来是广州一家小机械厂的翻砂徒工。1924年工厂倒闭，他只得瞒了母亲，将自己卖了七块港币。还有更多的人，遇上天灾失收，地主还逼着要租，只得出去打零工，最后狠心将自己交给了“猪仔头”。
    只等在“猪仔契约”上按过手印，接过那七、八块港币以后，就成了失去自由的牛马。任人摆布，被编上组、编上号，胸前挂上号码，有的还被剃光了头。回来的这些华工中，就有名叫欧大、麦二、钟四、庞五、唐八、黄九、李十二、林十五的，很多就是从这编号来的。接着，被押解着，上船下船，上车下车。而上下车船的时间，都在漆黑的夜晚，为的是使他们忘却还乡的道路，将来想逃也逃不了。
    契约上写得明白，契约华工必须为荷兰殖民主义者做足三百六十个工，才能取得一张“脱身凭扎”，算是赎出了自己。七十六岁的老矿工杨凤才这样叙述了那段日子：每天早晨四点多钟，锡矿公司的大鼓一响，我们就被轰起来冒着刺骨的海风，被迫洗完难于忍受的冷水浴，就无止无休地从深七十米到一百二十米的矿坑底下，沿着窄窄的跳邦把矿砂挑上来。一天挑不够八立方米到十立方米，就别想平安地回到工棚。稍为走慢一点，殖民主义者及其走狗的皮鞋、皮鞭就不断落在你身上。哪一天少挑了一点，挨打之外还不给记工，等于白做。所以，没有一个人能真正只做三百六十天就能赎出身来。多少人做了几年累得大口吐血，甚至累死也没赎出身来。
      “脱身”难道就自由了吗？
    “脱身”，除了能稍稍增加工资外，绝不意味着取得了真正的自由。“脱身”之后，两手空空，只得继续做工维持生活。看一看这些老人带回来的“脱身凭扎”就会明白“脱身”并没有使他们摆脱奴隶的命运。矿工吴煜“脱身凭扎”的第一页上有一张照片，照片上的人胸前写着号码、姓名、矿场的英文缩写字母，简直是犯人打扮。照片上的吴煜年青有神，使人很难相信他就是现在在兴隆华侨农场那个衰弱不堪的老人。翻过篇，整整一页，是他从1931年到1955年的工作情况登记。其中栏目很多，有每日工银、赏钱、生病、犯罪、逃走、懒惰、违命、出外、食药、相斗、偷物、斗事、背约，等等。二十四年的记载里，吴煜只得过一次赏银，而生病、懒惰等等的记载却年年都有，越到后来的年份越多。这些记载就意味着扣工资、挨饿、挨打的次数越多。透过这几张薄纸，照见了契约华工凄苦的一生。
    死神，无时不在这些已“脱身”、未“脱身”的华工身边巡逡。从那一百多米高的跳邦上跌下来摔死，被砍伐下来的大树根压死，被疾病折磨死，被殖民主义者的鞭子抽死……。据一个极不完全的统计，从1931年到1940年，到印度尼西亚的契约华工在八万人左右。这些人能够活着回来的寥寥无几，大部分已为印度尼西亚的繁荣献出了生命，邦加、勿里洞的矿山、日里的橡胶园、烟园里，到处有他们的白骨。
    不少华工曾经不顾死的威胁，反抗、逃亡。现在在广西的老华工李进才记得，1922年，他所在的文岛锡矿场，大批华工逃亡。荷兰殖民主义者将矿区周围的铁丝网通上电流，使逃亡者都被电烧死。也还有一些华工感到走投无路而自杀了。老矿工黄亚华的记忆里，还留着那些悲惨的故事：“有一次，我们又被赶去洗冷水浴，洗完上来就少了三个工友，他们自杀了。”
    也有人下过决心，狠命干它几年，积两个钱跳出这火坑。可是，工资本来就少，加上经过克扣、罚款，根本拿不到几个钱。最后，还有赌场、酒馆要吮干你最后几滴血。廖洪当初就是想挣钱养活母亲而卖身的。结果，三十七年，没有给母亲寄过一块钱，也回不了家乡。想在那里成家吧，一个结婚证要一百元，生一个孩子要交二十五元，孩子长到十六岁又要交三十元，不然就逮捕，到哪里去找这么多钱啊！廖洪说：“我后悔呀，做梦也想回家乡，可是，我失去了自由，连勿里洋的街市都不能去。后来，我就喝酒、抽烟。在干活、挨打、抽烟、喝酒里过了三十七年！落得光身一人回国。”一个六十七岁的契约华工李盛，去南洋时家里有年青的妻子和刚出生的儿子，原指望去干它三年五载，挣点钱回来养家。现在，总算回来了，妻子却早已去世，儿子如果活着也该四十五岁了，想去找他却连姓名都不知道。
    这些老人家劳苦了一生，一到五十五岁，按照锡矿公司的规定一律解雇。解雇以后到哪里去呢？没有积蓄，没有依靠，回国又没有费用。于是，有的走进了华侨团体办的贫老院，也有的冒着生命危险，重新走进荒山，靠设陷阱捕捉野兽和砍柴种菜维生。近来，当他们决定踏破惊涛骇浪投奔祖国时，印度尼西亚有势力集团还要收他们这样那样的税，连他们行囊里最后的半公斤胡椒，几颗治病的发冷丸都被没收。
    这些饱经风霜的契约华工，有的已经回来两、三个月了。不断有消息传来，说老人们已经爱上了华侨农场的敬老院，说老人们常常关心农场的胡椒、咖啡长得好不好，说老人们已经变得有说有笑，说老人们常常在叨念着毛主席的恩情……看来，新生活正在慢慢平复他们的创伤。
    然而，事情并没有结束。从海外不断传来迫害华侨的消息，杀害华侨的枪声，殴打华侨的木棍声，辱骂华侨的咆哮，可是，有一个声音比这一切更响亮。那就是契约华工的控诉声：“印度尼西亚的土地吸干了我们多少人的血汗啊！可是我们还被人叫作‘吸血虫’？”这声音，激越高昂，悲愤有力，粉碎了一切排华分子的谰言。（附图片）
