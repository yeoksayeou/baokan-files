To increase transportation capacity on highways by promoting "Six Transformations of Road Maintenance."
Highway departments in various regions actively create conditions to ensure cars run faster, safer, and carry more.

(Report from this newspaper) On the highway transportation front, a "Six Transformations of Road Maintenance" movement, with good road surface maintenance as the central task, is vigorously developing. The "Six Transformations" are: (Road surface is flat, solid, and clean; highways are passable in all weather conditions; routes are adapted to train operations; bridges and ferries are safe and unobstructed; operations are mechanized and semi-mechanized; roads are greened and landscaped). According to statistics from twenty-one provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangxi, and Sichuan, more than 100,000 kilometers have met the requirements of a flat, solid, and clean road surface; and the mileage of semi-mechanized road maintenance has reached more than 80,000 kilometers. By the end of May, more than sixty counties and cities across the country had fully realized the "Six Transformations of Road Maintenance," creating favorable conditions for automobile transportation.

With the continuous improvement of automobile transportation efficiency and the increase in traffic density, especially the development of automobile train operations, the requirements for highways are higher. The simple highways newly built last winter and this spring, due to incomplete equipment, have a weak ability to resist natural disasters, which affects the performance of automobile use. In order to adapt to the new situation, the majority of road maintenance workers have put forward the slogan of "Increase transportation capacity from the highways" and adopted measures such as straightening curves, reducing slopes, widening roadbeds and pavements, and laying wear-resistant and protective layers to improve the highway's carrying capacity and accelerate vehicle turnover. At present, Qinghai Province has laid 969 kilometers of wear-resistant layer, and the percentage of roads that are flat, solid, and clean has increased from the original 49% to 59%, with an average driving speed of 40 to 45 kilometers per hour. The Qaidam Transportation Bureau, while maintaining the road surface, has focused on major improvement projects, widening 419 kilometers of roadbed.

As the requirements for highways by automobile transportation are getting higher and higher, and the maintenance tasks are becoming more and more arduous, the original maintenance strength appears to be insufficient. Many regions have focused on road surface maintenance, which uses the most labor, and have tried every means to start with tool reforms, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, changing manual operations to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, greatly improving labor efficiency and saving labor. The Wengyuan Road Maintenance District in Guangdong Province focused its reforms on the weakest links and the most labor-intensive processes; based on the principle of using local methods and not relying on foreign ones, it manufactured disc-type sand spreading vehicles, automatic lifting and scraping sand vehicles, water spraying and pumping vehicles, etc., so that the average maintenance mileage of each worker increased from 1.8 kilometers in the past to 4 kilometers, and comprehensive maintenance was strengthened, changing the past situation where the technical condition of the road declined due to a slight increase in the number of vehicles, meeting the needs of transportation.

    推行“养路六化”向公路要运力
    各地公路部门积极创造条件保证汽车跑得更快更安全拉得更多
    本报讯　在公路交通战线上，一个以养好路面为纲的“养路六化”（路面平实整洁化、公路晴雨通车化、路线适应列车化、桥渡安全畅通化、操作机械化半机械化、道路绿化园林化）运动，正在蓬勃发展。据河北、上海、福建、广西、四川等二十一个省、市、区的统计，已有十万多公里达到路面平实整洁的要求；养路半机械化里程达八万多公里。到5月底，全国已有六十多个县、市全面实现了“养路六化”，为汽车运输创造了良好条件。
    随着汽车运输效率的不断提高，和行车密度的加大，特别是汽车列车化的发展，对公路的要求更高了；去冬今春新建的简易公路，由于设备不全，抵抗自然灾害的能力不强，影响到汽车使用效能的发挥。为了适应新形势的要求，广大养路职工提出了“向公路要运力”的口号，采取裁弯、降坡、加宽路基路面、以及铺筑磨耗层保护层等措施，来提高公路通过能力，加速车辆周转。目前青海全省已铺筑磨耗层九百六十九公里，达到平实整洁的公路由原来的49％增长到59％，行车时速平均达到四十至四十五公里。柴达木交通局在养好路面的同时，大抓重点改善工程，加宽路基四百一十九公里。
    由于汽车运输对公路的要求越来越高，养护任务日益繁重，原有养护力量显得不足。许多地区抓住了使用劳力最多的路面保修工作，千方百计地从工具改革着手，大闹技术革新和技术革命，变手工操作为机械化半机械化操作，大大提高了劳动效率，节约了劳动力。广东翁源养路工区针对什么环节最薄弱、哪道工序最费工，就把它作为改革的重点；本着能土则土不等洋的原则，制造了圆盘撒沙车、自动升降刮砂车、洒水、抽水车等机具，使每个工人平均养护里程从过去的一点八公里提高到四公里，并加强了全面养护，改变了过去因为车次略为增加，道路技术状况就下降的情况，满足了运输需要。
