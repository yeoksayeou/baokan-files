Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Returned overseas Chinese in the capital held a meeting this afternoon, angrily protesting the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, for forcibly relocating overseas Chinese and creating incidents of massacre of overseas Chinese.

At today's meeting, the returned overseas Chinese righteously pointed out: In order to safeguard the friendship between the people of China and Indonesia, the Indonesian government, which had promised to stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese, should immediately take measures to punish the murderers who killed overseas Chinese, provide compensation to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop the forced relocation, and stop the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

Chen Manyun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said indignantly that the Cimaung massacre of overseas Chinese was by no means accidental. It was deliberately created by powerful groups in Indonesia. The West Java military authorities not only broke the promise made by the Indonesian government that it would no longer forcibly relocate overseas Chinese, but even intensified the persecution of overseas Chinese, even at the cost of creating bloody tragedies. The purpose is to further undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. She concluded by saying: All returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing resolutely support the legitimate demands of local overseas Chinese, and demand that the Indonesian authorities immediately stop the crime of persecuting overseas Chinese.

Wang Yuanxing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the meeting: "The people of Indonesia and the people of China have been friends and brothers for generations. The anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia are completely contrary to the interests of the Indonesian people."

Li Mei, a member of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, expressed great indignation at the crime of the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, for killing overseas Chinese. She said: "Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio once promised not to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese, but to this day, anti-Chinese activities have not only not stopped, but have intensified. As a returned overseas Chinese woman who has lived in Indonesia for nearly half a century, I lodge a serious protest to the Indonesian authorities."

Wu Yixiu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: "People all over the world can see very clearly that the crimes of a small group of reactionary elements in Indonesia in killing overseas Chinese are against the will of the Indonesian people. We demand that the Indonesian government immediately stop anti-China and anti-Chinese activities."

You Yangzu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that overseas Chinese have been in Indonesia for more than a thousand years, and they have established a deep friendship with the local people. Today, the Indonesian government should consider the friendship between China and Indonesia, punish the murderers, immediately stop the anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia, and ensure that the inhuman incident of killing overseas Chinese will not happen again in the future.

Huang Changshui, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that we are indignant at the crime of the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, for sending armed military police to kill overseas Chinese. We demand that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers who killed overseas Chinese, stop anti-Chinese activities, and ensure that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

Many of the people who spoke at the meeting were recently transported back to China by ships sent by our government from Indonesia. They personally experienced persecution in the anti-Chinese wave launched by powerful groups in Indonesia, and today they are even more indignant at the killing of overseas Chinese by the military authorities in West Java.

Fang Yanling, former chairman of the Bandung Overseas Chinese Association, who only left Bandung on May 27 this year to return to China, said at the meeting: "I feel very sad and indignant that this persecution of overseas Chinese happened in my second hometown. At the beginning of March this year, when the motherland sent ships to pick up overseas Chinese to return to China, the Indonesian people in Lianwang, Cimaung and other places were reluctant to leave, and some even shed tears. The chairman of the local Indonesia-China Friendship Association also went to each area to comfort the overseas Chinese. This shows that although powerful groups in Indonesia deliberately launched anti-Chinese activities, the traditional friendship between the people of China and Indonesia can never be destroyed."

Tian Texiang, who recently returned from Indonesia, demanded in his speech that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers who killed overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, and demanded an immediate end to anti-Chinese activities.

Representatives of returned overseas Chinese students from Peking University, Beijing University of Technology, Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal College, and Petroleum Institute, such as Chen Ruxia, Zhuang Chunfeng, Yang Meiye, Lin Mengliu, Liao Xuehong, and Huang Guofan, condemned the killing of overseas Chinese by powerful groups in Indonesia in their speeches. They pointed out at the meeting that powerful groups in Indonesia have recently been persecuting overseas Chinese and destroying the deep friendship between us and the Indonesian people for more than a thousand years. This bloody massacre has developed to an extremely serious degree, which the Chinese people will never allow.

Huang Fukun, a returned overseas Chinese worker from Malaya, warned the powerful groups in Indonesia that today's overseas Chinese are overseas Chinese who have a strong motherland to rely on. The era when overseas Chinese were arbitrarily bullied, exploited, and slaughtered has passed. The legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese must be respected, all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities must be stopped immediately, and the murderers must be severely punished according to law. The traditional friendship between the people of China and Indonesia can never be destroyed by a small group of reactionary elements.

Zhao Wenhua, an old lady, vice chairman of the Bandung Chinese Association, who recently returned from Bandung, said angrily in her speech: "Overseas Chinese women are unarmed and were shot innocently. I can't bear it anymore. I want to protest to the Indonesian authorities!"

A total of twenty-seven people spoke at today's meeting. They unanimously expressed indignation at the bloody case of the massacre of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and pointed out that the traditional friendship between the people of China and Indonesia can never be destroyed by a small group of reactionary elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 5th: The Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese held a meeting this morning to strongly protest and severely condemn the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, for creating a bloody tragedy of killing overseas Chinese, demanding that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers who killed overseas Chinese, provide compensation to the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop the forced relocation, and take effective measures to immediately stop anti-Chinese activities.

Huang Qinshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, spoke first at the meeting. He said that the people of Shanghai and returned overseas Chinese expressed great indignation at the crime of the military authorities in West Java for shooting unarmed overseas Chinese. He pointed out that this incident was by no means accidental, but was deliberately created by forces hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia. Recently, under the instigation and support of powerful groups in Indonesia, anti-Chinese activities have not only not stopped, but have intensified. Their conspiracy is to undermine the traditional friendship between the people of China and Indonesia, and it is also an attack on the people of Indonesia. Huang Qinshu pointed out that our government has always attached importance to the friendship between the two peoples and, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, has actively strived to comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue through normal channels. However, powerful groups in Indonesia are intensifying their anti-Chinese activities in an attempt to undermine the friendship between the two peoples. Their conspiracy will be shamefully defeated.

Dong Yinchu, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, who was imprisoned in the Cimaung concentration camp during the Japanese imperialist invasion of Indonesia, said: The place where the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, killed overseas Chinese—Cimaung—is the place where the Japanese invaders set up concentration camps to brutally persecute the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese. There, the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese once fought heroically against the Japanese invaders, sharing hardships and difficulties together. Today, the military authorities in West Java actually created a tragedy of killing overseas Chinese there, which is extremely infuriating. The Chinese people deeply understand that the Indonesian people are friends of the Chinese people, and they have a brotherly relationship with overseas Chinese. The murderers who persecuted overseas Chinese are only a small group of reactionary elements.

Chen Shiyin, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that a small group of reactionary forces in Indonesia, regardless of the interests of the country and the people, do not fight against the true enemies of the Indonesian people—the imperialists—but instead point their guns at overseas Chinese who have made many contributions to Indonesia's economic development and anti-imperialist struggle, and also deny the crime of shooting overseas Chinese. We believe that the Indonesian government has the responsibility to severely punish the murderers who killed overseas Chinese.

Xia Fangpei, Wu Pinxian, and others, members of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese who had lived in Indonesia for many years, unanimously angrily denounced the crime of the military authorities in West Java for killing overseas Chinese women in their speeches. They said: The military authorities in West Java killed a mother who was four months pregnant, and did not allow anyone to rescue an overseas Chinese woman who was shot seven times and fell to the ground calling for help. This bloody atrocity is extremely cruel. They firmly stated: We must not tolerate our sisters being killed, and we must not allow powerful groups in Indonesia to undermine the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries.

Yang Bangfu, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Zhang Miansheng, a member of the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and others also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously and firmly demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers who created this bloody incident and immediately take effective measures to stop all anti-Chinese activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 5th: Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Fuzhou held a meeting today to strongly protest the atrocities of the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, for shooting overseas Chinese women, and resolutely demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers who created the bloody tragedy, provide compensation to the families of the victims, release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop the forced relocation, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, who were killed by the military authorities in West Java, were both relatives of Lin Ketie, a returned overseas Chinese. The former was his nephew's wife, and the latter was his great-nephew's wife. Lin Ketie said angrily at the meeting: My nephew's wife and great-nephew's wife have lived in Cimaung for more than 20 years. They have always been law-abiding, and they get along well with Indonesians and have many Indonesian friends. Now they have been killed innocently. He firmly demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers. Lin Ketie spoke three times at the meeting. When he said passionately that we Chinese overseas Chinese will never allow anyone to bully us, everyone present was filled with indignation and unanimously expressed that they resolutely demanded that the relevant Indonesian authorities punish the murderers, provide compensation to the families of the victims, and ensure that anti-Chinese activities are stopped and the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese are protected.

Guo Ruiren, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said in his speech: Since powerful groups in Indonesia launched anti-Chinese activities, unfortunate incidents have been happening every day, and now they have even created bloody incidents, which is by no means accidental. Powerful groups in Indonesia have recently intensified their anti-Chinese activities, and they deliberately created this tragedy in order to achieve ulterior motives. We firmly protest against this. Chen Fengbin, an overseas Chinese who recently returned from West Java, and Chen Xiqin and Xu Sharen, overseas Chinese who returned from North Sumatra, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously strongly condemned the conspiracy of powerful groups in Indonesia to undermine the friendship between China and Indonesia.

The people who attended the meeting also sent a letter of protest to the Indonesian government, demanding that the Indonesian authorities punish the murderers and the persons responsible for the incident, provide compensation to the families of the victims, compensate the losses suffered by overseas Chinese, stop anti-Chinese activities, and prevent similar incidents from happening.

    必须立即制止迫害华侨的罪行
    首都上海归侨和福州归侨、侨眷集会严厉谴责西爪哇军事当局屠杀华侨
    据新华社5日讯　首都归国华侨人士今天下午举行集会，愤怒抗议印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局武力强迫华侨迁移，制造惨杀华侨事件。
    在今天的集会上，归国华侨们义正词严地指出：为了维护中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊，曾经作过停止迫迁华侨诺言的印度尼西亚政府应该立即采取措施，惩办杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤被害者的家属，立即释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁，停止反华、排华活动。
    北京市归国华侨联合会副主席陈曼云愤慨地说，芝马圩惨杀华侨事件的发生，绝不是偶然的，这是印度尼西亚有势力集团蓄意制造的，西爪哇军事当局不但毫无信义地背弃了印度尼西亚政府刚刚作过的不再强迫华侨迁移的诺言，反而变本加厉地迫害华侨，甚至不惜制造流血惨案，其目的是进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系。她最后表示：我们北京全体归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生坚决支持当地侨胞的正当要求，要求印度尼西亚当局立即制止迫害华侨的罪行。
    全国归国华侨联合会副主席王源兴在会上说：“印度尼西亚人民同中国人民世世代代是朋友，是兄弟，印度尼西亚有势力集团的反华排华活动，是和印度尼西亚人民的利益完全相违背的。”
    北京市侨联委员李梅在发言中对印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨的罪行表示极大的愤慨。她说：“印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约曾经答应不再强迫华侨迁移，但是时至今日，排华活动不但没有停止，反而变本加厉。我以一个在印度尼西亚侨居了近半个世纪的归侨妇女的身份，向印度尼西亚当局提出严重的抗议。”
    北京市归国华侨联合会副主席吴益修说：“全世界人民都可以看得很清楚，印度尼西亚一小撮反动分子的杀害华侨的罪行是违反印度尼西亚人民意志的。我们要求印度尼西亚政府立即制止反华、排华活动。”
    中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席尤扬祖说，华侨在印度尼西亚一千多年，他们和当地人民建立了深厚友谊，今天印度尼西亚政府应该为中国和印度尼西亚的友谊着想，惩办凶手，立即制止印度尼西亚有势力集团排华活动，保证今后不再发生杀害华侨的惨无人道的事件。
    中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席黄长水说，我们对印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局派出武装军警杀害华侨的罪行感到愤慨。我们要求印度尼西亚政府严惩杀害华侨的凶手，制止排华活动，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    在会上发言的人，有不少是最近由我国政府派船从印度尼西亚接运回国的，他们在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的排华浪潮中，亲身经受过迫害，今天对西爪哇军事当局制造的杀害华侨事件，更是感到愤慨。
    今年5月27日才从万隆动身回国的前万隆华侨公会主席房延陵在会上说：“这次迫害华侨的事件发生在我的第二故乡，我感到非常悲痛和愤慨。今年3月初，祖国派船接华侨归国时，连旺、芝马圩等地印度尼西亚人民都恋恋不舍，有的还掉下泪来。当地印度尼西亚中国友好协会主席还到每个地区慰问华侨。这说明尽管印度尼西亚有势力集团蓄意掀起排华活动，但是中国印度尼西亚两国人民的传统友谊是永远破坏不了的。”
    最近从印度尼西亚回国的田特相在发言中，要求印度尼西亚政府严惩杀害华侨妇女杨木妹和叶金娘的凶手，要求立即停止排华活动。
    来自北京大学、北京工业大学、中国人民大学、清华大学、北京师范学院、石油学院等高等学校的归国华侨学生代表陈如遐、庄春风、杨梅叶、林猛流、廖学宏、黄国范等在发言中谴责印度尼西亚有势力集团制造的杀害华侨事件。他们在会上指出，印度尼西亚有势力集团最近不断迫害华侨，破坏我们和印度尼西亚人民相处一千多年来的深厚友谊，这次的血腥屠杀，发展到了极其严重的程度，这是中国人民所决不允许的。
    马来亚归侨工人黄福昆警告印度尼西亚有势力集团说，今天的华侨是有强大祖国做靠山的华侨，华侨任意受人欺凌压榨、任人宰割的时代已经过去了，华侨的正当权益必须受到尊重，一切反华排华活动必须立即停止，杀人凶手必须依法严惩。中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的传统友谊决不是一小撮反动分子所能破坏得了的。
    最近从万隆回国的万隆中华公会副主席赵文华老太太在发言中激愤地说：“华侨妇女手无寸铁，无辜遭到枪杀，我不能再忍下去了，我要向印度尼西亚当局提出抗议！”
    在今天的会上共有二十七人发了言。他们对印度尼西亚发生的惨杀华侨的血案一致表示愤慨，并且指出，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的传统友谊绝不是一小撮反动分子所能破坏了的。
    新华社上海5日电　上海市归国华侨联合会今天上午举行集会，强烈抗议和严厉谴责印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局制造杀害华侨流血惨剧，要求印度尼西亚政府严惩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤被害者的家属，立即释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁，并采取有效措施立即制止排华活动。
    上海市归国华侨联合会主席黄钦书首先在会上发言。他说，上海人民和归侨，对于西爪哇军事当局枪杀手无寸铁的华侨的罪行表示极大的愤慨。他指出，这一事件绝不是偶然发生，而是敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力所蓄意制造的。最近在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动和支持下，排华活动不仅没有停止，反而更加加紧了。他们的阴谋在于破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的传统友谊，同时也是对印度尼西亚人民的进攻。黄钦书指出，我国政府一贯以两国人民的友谊为重，根据和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议精神，遵循正常途径，积极为全面解决华侨问题而努力。但印度尼西亚有势力集团却在变本加厉地进行排华活动，企图破坏两国人民的友谊。他们的这一阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
    上海市侨联副主席、在日本帝国主义侵略印度尼西亚期间曾被关进芝马圩集中营的董寅初说：现在印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨的地方——芝马圩，就是当年日本侵略者设置集中营残害印度尼西亚人民和华侨的地方。在那里，印度尼西亚人民和华侨曾为反对日本侵略者，同艰苦共患难进行过英勇的斗争。今天，西爪哇军事当局竟然在那里制造杀害华侨的惨剧，令人极其愤慨。中国人民深深理解，印度尼西亚人民是中国人民的朋友，而他们同华侨有着亲如兄弟的感情。迫害华侨的凶手，仅仅是一小撮反动分子。
    上海市归国华侨联合会副主席兼秘书长、印度尼西亚归侨陈失因说，印度尼西亚一小撮反动势力不顾国家和人民的利益，不去同印度尼西亚人民的真正的敌人——帝国主义者进行斗争，反而把枪口对准曾经对印度尼西亚的经济发展和反帝斗争有过不少贡献的华侨，并且还抵赖枪杀华侨的罪行。我们认为，印度尼西亚政府有责任严惩杀害侨胞的凶手。
    上海市侨联委员、曾侨居印度尼西亚多年的夏芳佩、吴品先等人在发言中，一致愤怒地痛责西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨妇女的罪行。她们说：西爪哇军事当局杀害怀胎四个月的母亲，对于身中七弹倒地呼救的华侨妇女也不准人去抢救，这种血腥暴行，残忍已极。她们坚决表示：决不能容忍自己的姐妹们任人杀害，也决不能容许印度尼西亚有势力集团破坏两国人民的传统友谊。
    在会上发言的，还有上海市侨联副主席杨邦服、侨联委员张棉盛等。他们一致坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩制造这次流血事件的凶手，并立即采取有效措施制止一切排华活动。
    新华社福州5日电　福州市归国华侨和华侨眷属在今天举行集会，强烈抗议印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局枪杀华侨妇女的暴行，坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩制造流血惨案的凶手，抚恤被害者家属，释放被捕的华侨，停止迫迁和保证不再发生类似事件。
    被西爪哇军事当局杀害的杨木妹和叶金娘，都是归国华侨林克铁的亲人，前者是他的侄媳妇，后者是他的侄孙媳妇。林克铁在会上愤怒地说：我的侄媳妇和侄孙媳妇在芝马圩住了二十多年，她们一向是奉公守法的，同印度尼西亚人相处很好，有许多印度尼西亚朋友，现在她们竟遭到无辜杀害。他坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手。林克铁在会上连续发言了三次，当他激昂地说我们中国侨民绝不允许人家欺侮时，与会者个个义愤填膺，一致表示坚决要求印度尼西亚有关当局惩办凶手，抚恤被害者家属，并保证停止排华活动，保障华侨的正当权益。
    福建省归国华侨联合会副主席、印度尼西亚归国华侨郭瑞人在发言中说：自从印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起排华活动以来，不幸的事件天天都有，现在竟然制造流血事件，这决不是偶然的。印度尼西亚有势力集团最近加紧排华活动，他们为了达到不可告人的目的而蓄意制造了这次惨案。我们对此表示坚决抗议。在会上发言的还有最近从西爪哇回国的华侨陈凤彬，从北苏门答腊回国的华侨陈细琴、徐沙人等人。他们一致强烈谴责印度尼西亚有势力集团破坏中国和印度尼西亚友好的阴谋活动。
    到会的人并向印度尼西亚政府发出一份抗议书，抗议书中要求印度尼西亚当局惩办凶手和制造事件的负责人，抚恤被害者家属，赔偿华侨所受损失，制止排华活动，防止类似事件发生。（附图片）
