Reciprocity is the Rule of Propriety
By People's Daily Commentator

On July 6th, Eisenhower signed the Sugar Act aimed at打击 (dǎjī:crackdown on) the Cuban economy, brazenly slashing Cuba's sugar import quota by 700,000 tons. This is another base and shameless action by the U.S. government to blatantly and directly interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and undermine the Cuban revolution.

The United States has exhausted all kinds of vicious means to interfere in the Cuban revolution, but none of them have achieved their goals. The gentlemen in Washington are now resorting to such economic bludgeons. From their perspective, Cuba cannot survive without the United States as its main sugar buyer and therefore has to kneel and surrender under U.S. pressure. This is, of course, a dream. As the Cuban "Revolución" newspaper stated, this aggressive measure taken by the United States "only creates conditions that prompt us to achieve the complete liberation of our economy faster and more resolutely, to expand our markets and diversify our production. In this way, the conspiracies of our enemies to overthrow us have become a force that stimulates us to achieve our ultimate goal."

"Reciprocity is the Rule of Propriety." Since U.S. imperialism is so vicious towards the Cuban people, the Cuban government naturally cannot but take appropriate measures to safeguard national sovereignty and economic development. The Cuban cabinet has passed a law on the expropriation of American property in Cuba. This decision of the Cuban government has won the firm support of the Cuban people.

The U.S. government's reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota is a sign that the United States is further intensifying its interference in the Cuban revolution. On the same day that Eisenhower signed the so-called Sugar Act, he openly stated that the United States may take "appropriate" actions against Cuba in order to "protect its own interests." This is worthy of vigilance from the Cuban people and all peace-loving people. But no matter what trick U.S. imperialism plays, it will surely be met with a resolute counterattack from the Cuban people. The U.S. conspiracy to interfere in the Cuban revolution will never succeed.

    来而不往非礼也
    本报评论员
    7月6日，艾森豪威尔签署了旨在打击古巴经济的食糖法案，悍然把古巴食糖进口定额削减七十万吨。这是美国政府公然直接干涉古巴内政，破坏古巴革命的又一次卑鄙无耻行动。
    美国为了干涉古巴的革命，曾经用尽了各种各样穷凶极恶的手段，但是都没有能达到目的。华盛顿老爷们现在竟又用起这样的经济大棒来了。从他们看来，古巴没有了美国这个购买食糖的主顾就无法活命的，因而就只得在美国的压力面前屈膝投降的。这当然是梦想。正如古巴“革命报”所说的，美国所采取的这种侵略措施“只是造成了促使我们更快和更坚决地获得我国经济彻底解放，日益扩大我们的市场和使我们的生产多样化的条件。这样，我们敌人为打倒我们的所进行的阴谋活动，变成了刺激我们达到最终目的的力量”。
    “来而不往非礼也”。美帝国主义对古巴人民既然这样恶毒，古巴政府自然不能不采取维护国家主权和经济发展的适当措施。古巴内阁已经通过一项关于征用美国人在古巴的财产的法律。古巴政府的这一决定获得了古巴人民坚决支持。
    美国政府削减古巴食糖进口定额的做法，是美国进一步加紧干涉古巴革命的一个标志。艾森豪威尔在签署所谓食糖法案的同一天，就公然表示美国为了“保护自己的利益”可能对古巴采取“适当的”行动。这是值得古巴人民和各国爱好和平人民警惕的。但是不论美帝国主义还会出那一手，它都一定会遭到古巴人民的坚决还击。美国干涉古巴革命的阴谋决难得逞。
