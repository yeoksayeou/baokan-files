Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, wrote a letter on July 13th to Huang Guocyue, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, expressing full support for the movement currently being carried out by the Vietnamese people nationwide against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique.

In his letter, Liu Ningyi said that it has been six years since the signing of the Geneva Accords restoring peace in Indochina. This was the result of the heroic Vietnamese people, with the resolute support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people around the world, dealing an extremely heavy blow to the French aggressors and thwarting the U.S. imperialist plot to expand the Indochina war, thus making a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Liu Ningyi's letter stated that, however, due to U.S. imperialism's consistent obstruction of Vietnam's reunification and its plot to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony, it has continuously undermined the Geneva Accords on resolving the Vietnam issue, causing Vietnam's territory to remain divided to this day. Under the support of U.S. imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique in South Vietnam has not only rejected a series of reasonable proposals from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but is also intensifying its military build-up and war preparations, subjecting the people of South Vietnam to extremely barbaric suppression and massacres. Recently, U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, have even more blatantly and seriously violated the Geneva Accords, formulated the fascist Law No. 10 of 1959, and illegally increased the number of U.S. military personnel stationed in South Vietnam. All of these activities, aimed at exacerbating tensions in Asia and promoting America's war and aggression policies, once again tell the people of Asia and the world that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the world's people.

The letter said that the Chinese working class and people fully support the movement currently being carried out by the Vietnamese people nationwide against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique. We are excited to see that the working people in various parts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are holding massive rallies and demonstrations. Slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam!" and "Oppose the fascist Law No. 10 of 1959" resound through the sky. The people of South Vietnam, who are in dire straits, have also reached the end of their patience and are launching an increasingly vigorous struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. We firmly believe that with the strong support of the powerful socialist camp and all peace-loving people, the Vietnamese people's just cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

Liu Ningyi said in his letter: The people of China and Vietnam are close neighbors who are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and brothers who share weal and woe. As early as in the struggle for national liberation and against imperialism, the people of our two countries supported and helped each other, forging a fighting friendship. This friendship has gained new and continuous development in the socialist construction of China and Vietnam, in the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, in supporting the liberation movements of oppressed people and oppressed nations in various countries, and in the struggle for world peace. Not long ago, the extremely warm welcome and reception received by our Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit to your country, and the joint communiqué issued by the Premiers of China and Vietnam, vividly reflected the profound brotherly friendship between the people of our two countries. Let us unite even more closely under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, work hard, persevere in our struggle, and no matter how imperialism carries out its death throes, the noble cause of socialism and world peace must eventually achieve victory.

    中越人民在反帝斗争中休戚与共
　　刘宁一致函黄国越支持越南人民反对美吴集团的斗争
    新华社17日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一13日写信给越南总工会主席黄国越，表示全力支持越南人民正在全国范围内开展的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的运动。
    刘宁一在信中说，恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议已经签订六周年了。这是英勇的越南人民，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营以及全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持下，给予法国侵略者以极其沉重的打击，并且粉碎了美帝国主义企图扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，从而对亚洲和世界和平事业作出了重大贡献。
    刘宁一的信中说，但是，由于美帝国主义一贯阻挠越南的统一，阴谋变越南南方为美国的军事基地和殖民地，不断地破坏关于解决越南问题的日内瓦协议，致使越南的国土至今处于分裂状态。在美帝国主义的扶植下，越南南方的吴庭艳卖国集团不仅拒绝了越南民主共和国的一系列合理的建议，而且正在加紧扩军备战，对越南南方人民施以极其野蛮的镇压和屠杀。最近，美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团更明目张胆的严重破坏日内瓦协议，制定了1959年第十号法西斯法令，并非法增加美国驻越南南方的军事人员。这一切旨在加剧亚洲紧张局势和推行美国的战争政策和侵略政策的活动，再一次告诉亚洲和全世界人民，美帝国主义是世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
  信中说，中国工人阶级和人民全力支持越南人民正在全国范围内开展的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的运动。我们兴奋地看到，越南民主共和国各地的劳动人民正纷纷举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行。“打倒美帝国主义！”，“美帝国主义从南越滚出去”，“反对1959年第十号法西斯法令”等口号响彻云霄。处于水深火热中的越南南方人民也已忍无可忍，对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团正展开日益高涨的斗争。我们深信，在强大的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民的大力支持下，越南人民争取和平统一祖国的正义事业一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    刘宁一在信中说：中越两国人民是唇齿相依的近邻，是休戚与共的兄弟。我们两国人民早在争取民族解放、反对帝国主义的斗争中，就互相支持、互相帮助，结成了战斗的友谊。这种友谊在中越两国的社会主义建设中，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义斗争中，在支持各国被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放运动中，在争取世界和平的斗争中又获得了新的不断的发展。不久前，我国周恩来总理在贵国访问时所受到的极其热烈的欢迎和接待和发表的中越两国总理联合公报中，生动地体现出我们两国人民之间的深厚的兄弟友谊。让我们在伟大的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来，努力工作，坚持斗争，不管帝国主义怎样进行垂死的挣扎，社会主义和世界和平的崇高事业最后一定要取得胜利。
