Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Comrade Liu Ningyi, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, gave a speech at the rally in the capital supporting the Vietnamese people's opposition to U.S. imperialist aggression and peaceful reunification of their country. The full text is as follows: Comrades, friends:

　　Today is the eve of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is launching a massive struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of the country. In South Vietnam, the struggle of the broad masses of the people against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, has also developed rapidly. People from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here to resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and to pay our highest respects to the heroic Vietnamese people.

　　Since the signing of the Geneva Accords on July 20, 1954, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have made unremitting efforts to uphold this solemn international agreement and peace in Indochina, and have put forward a series of fair and reasonable proposals on the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. However, due to the consistent obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not yet been realized. For six years, the U.S. government has brutally trampled on and undermined the Geneva Accords. U.S. imperialism has continuously and illegally transported various weapons and a large number of military personnel into South Vietnam, and has built military bases and strategic highways there, actively carrying out war preparations. Under the direct command of U.S. military "advisors," the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army has carried out barbaric "sweeps" in South Vietnam. The U.S.-Ngo clique has used all fascist means to carry out bloody massacres and persecutions of former resistance personnel and patriotic people. U.S. imperialism has also used South Vietnam as a base for aggression, constantly dispatching secret agents to sabotage the peaceful construction of North Vietnam, and instigates the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime to launch military provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia, who adheres to peace and neutrality. Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its actions, blatantly disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and even attempted to use a large number of U.S. military personnel to "rotate" the already withdrawn French "expeditionary force" personnel. This makes the ceasefire situation in Indochina increasingly unstable. These criminal activities of U.S. imperialism once again demonstrate that imperialism is unwilling to abide by international agreements that are conducive to peace and always tries to undermine them in every possible way. The aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism have profoundly educated the people of Indochina from the negative side, making them more closely united and waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

　　Now, the large-scale struggle movement launched by the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their country is surging forward. In the large and small cities, factories, and rural areas of North Vietnam, mass anti-American rallies and demonstrations are being held everywhere, denouncing the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. The broad masses of the people are turning hatred into strength and launching labor competitions against U.S. imperialism, striving to strengthen the socialist forces in North Vietnam. In South Vietnam, from the 17th parallel to Ca Mau Cape, the struggle against the dark rule of the U.S.-Ngo clique is also expanding. Even in the central area of the U.S.-Ngo clique's rule, slogans and leaflets saying "U.S. imperialism get out" and "Down with the traitor Ngo Dinh Diem" have appeared. The flames of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are spreading throughout Vietnam. The U.S.-Ngo clique is trapped in the encirclement of the Vietnamese people, and their lifespan will not be long.

　　The patriotic and just struggle of the Vietnamese people is an important part of the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. The struggle of the Vietnamese people not only severely hit the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Ngo clique in South Vietnam and strongly supported the national and democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also made increasing contributions to the cause of world peace. Socialist countries and all peace-loving people and countries stand with the heroic Vietnamese people. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is never isolated.

　　Comrades, friends, the current international situation is very favorable to the causes of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has incomparably powerful power. The forces of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries fighting for and safeguarding national independence, democratic freedom, the forces of the people's struggle in Western countries, and the forces of peace throughout the world are all developing and growing rapidly. A storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is sweeping across the world. The U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war is dragging itself into an inextricable quagmire and is getting deeper and deeper. The internal contradictions of the imperialist countries and between them are also deepening day by day. As long as the people of the world further consolidate and develop a united front against U.S. imperialism and persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to continuously frustrate the U.S. imperialist activities of aggression and expansion and the conspiracies to prepare for a new war, and win the final victory in defending world peace and striving for the cause of human progress.

　　The people of China and Vietnam have a traditional and profound friendship. We have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle against imperialism. The victory of the Vietnamese people is the victory of the Chinese people. The struggle of the Vietnamse people against U.S. imperialist aggression and striving for peaceful reunification of their motherland, will always have the full support of the 650 million Chinese. The United States government must strictly abide by the various provisions of the Geneva Accords. U.S. military personnel and weapons illegally entering South Vietnam must be completely withdrawn. Vietnam belongs to all the Vietnamese people, and no foreign intervention can stop the firm will of the Vietnamese people to peacefully reunify their motherland. The Chinese people firmly believe that with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people and countries, the just struggle of the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious, and the beautiful rivers and mountains of Vietnam from Lang Son to Ca Mau will eventually be unified.

　　Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Geneva Accords!
　　Resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!
　　The people of China and Vietnam unite, the people of Asia unite, the people of the world unite, and overthrow the common enemy—U.S. imperialism!
　　Long live world peace!

    美帝侵略政策必败　越南祖国统一必胜
　　中共中央委员、中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一的讲话
    新华社19日讯　中共中央委员、中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一在首都人民支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国大会上的讲话。全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    今天是关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议签订六周年的前夕，越南民主共和国正在展开一个规模巨大的反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争运动。在越南南方，广大人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗——吴庭艳集团的斗争也有了迅速的发展。我们首都各界人民在这里举行集会，坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，并且向英勇的越南人民致以崇高的敬意。
    自从1954年7月20日日内瓦协议签订以来，越南民主共和国政府和人民为维护这个庄严的国际协定和印度支那的和平进行了不懈的努力，并且就和平统一越南问题提出了一系列公平合理的建议。但是，由于美帝国主义一贯的阻挠和破坏，越南的和平统一至今没有得到实现。六年来，美国政府对日内瓦协议进行了粗暴的蹂躏和破坏。美帝国主义不断把各种武器和大批军事人员非法运入越南南方，并且在那里修建军事基地和战略公路，积极进行备战活动。在美国军事“顾问”的直接指挥下，吴庭艳集团的军队在越南南方进行了野蛮的“扫荡”。美吴集团用尽了一切法西斯手段对前抗战人员和爱国人民进行了血腥的屠杀和迫害。美帝国主义并且以越南南方为侵略基地，不断派遣特务破坏越南北方的和平建设事业，唆使吴庭艳傀儡政权向坚持和平中立的柬埔寨王国发动军事挑衅。最近，美帝国主义变本加厉，公然不顾日内瓦协议的规定，竟企图以大量美国军事人员来“轮换”早已撤走的法国
  “远征军”人员。这就使印度支那的停战局面越来越处于不稳定的状态。美帝国主义的这些罪恶的活动，再一次说明了帝国主义对于有利于和平的国际协议是不愿意遵守的，总是要千方百计地加以破坏。美帝国主义的侵略活动，深刻地从反面教育了印度支那各国人民，使他们更加紧密地团结起来，向美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    现在，越南人民所掀起的大规模反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争运动，正在汹涌澎湃地向前发展。在越南北方的大小城市和工厂、农村，到处都在举行群众反美集会和游行示威，声讨美帝国主义的滔天罪行。广大人民正在把仇恨化为力量，展开反对美帝国主义的劳动竞赛，为加强越南北方的社会主义力量而努力。在越南南方，从十七度线到金瓯角，反对美吴集团黑暗统治的斗争也在日趋扩大。就连美吴集团统治的中心地区，也出现了“美帝国主义滚出去”和“打倒吴庭艳卖国贼”的标语和传单。反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争怒火，正在燃遍整个越南。美吴集团正陷入越南人民的包围之中，他们的寿命不会很长了。
    越南人民的爱国正义斗争是全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争的一个重要部分。越南人民的斗争不仅沉重地打击了美吴集团在越南南方的反动统治，有力地支持了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民民族、民主运动，而且对于世界和平事业做出了越来越大的贡献。社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的人民和国家都同英勇的越南人民站在一起，越南人民的斗争永远不是孤立的。
    同志们，朋友们，当前的国际形势对于和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业十分有利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营有着无比强大的威力。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立、民主自由的力量，西方国家人民斗争的力量，和全世界的和平力量都在迅速地发展和壮大。一个反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在遍及世界各地。美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策正在把它自己拖进无法自拔的泥坑，并且越陷越深。帝国主义国家内部和它们相互之间的矛盾也在日益加深。只要全世界人民进一步巩固和发展反对美帝国主义的统一战线，坚持不懈地进行斗争，就一定能够不断挫败美帝国主义的侵略扩张活动和准备新战争的阴谋，赢得保卫世界和平和争取人类进步事业的最后胜利。
    中越两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。我们在反对帝国主义的斗争中一向互相同情，互相支援。越南人民的胜利就是中国人民的胜利。越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国和平统一的斗争，将始终得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。美国政府必须严格遵守日内瓦协议的各项规定。美国非法进入越南南方的军事人员和各种武器必须全部撤出。越南是属于全体越南人民的，任何外国的干涉都不能阻挡越南人民和平统一自己祖国的坚定意志。中国人民坚信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民和国家的大力支持下，越南人民的正义斗争一定能够获得胜利，从谅山到金瓯的越南大好河山，最终必将获得统一。
    坚决反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议！
    坚决支持越南人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争！
    中越人民团结起来，亚洲人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒共同的敌人——美帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
