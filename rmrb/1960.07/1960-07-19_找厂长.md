　　Looking for the Factory Director
　　Bian Zedong

　　Looking east, looking west, looking and looking, but still can't find him. In the office, there are clothes and a hat, but where has our factory director gone? Looking east, looking west, looking and looking, he was finally found… planting a "test plot" by the blast furnace, with a "apprentice" picking the materials; only to hear the workers praising: "The factory director has learned it!"

　　找厂长
　　卞泽东也找，西也找，找来找去找不到，办公室里有衣又有帽，可是咱厂长，不知哪去了？东也找，西也找，找来找去找到了……种“试验田”在高炉旁，有个“徒弟”在挑料；只听工人夸：“厂长学会了！”
