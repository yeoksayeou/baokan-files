The Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish People
Bo Yibo, Head of the Chinese Communist Party Delegation to Poland

At the invitation of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Chinese Communist Party delegation paid a two-week friendly visit to the Polish People's Republic from May 11 to May 26, 1960.

The delegation visited six provinces, six major cities, and several villages and towns, touring a series of factories and mines, as well as state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives.

The delegation met with Comrade Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and held several talks with leading comrades of the Central Committee. During visits to provinces, cities, factories, mines, cooperatives, and other places, they had extensive contact with leading comrades of local and grassroots party organizations, engaging in fraternal exchanges of information and experience. Although the two weeks were short, we are very grateful to our hosts for the excellent arrangements of the itinerary, which made it possible for the delegation to visit as many places as possible in a short period of time, and to learn about the work in various aspects such as industry, agriculture, culture and education, and party work.

There is a saying in China: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." The Chinese Party and the Chinese people have always been concerned about Poland's socialist construction. We also have a certain understanding of the work of the Polish Party, Poland's socialist construction, and the people's lives. However, it is only when the delegation has such an opportunity to personally visit such a beautiful country that the content of this understanding becomes richer and more vivid, and the situation of Poland's socialist construction and party work in all aspects is understood more deeply.

A general impression from the visits is that the Polish Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of Party members and the masses, are united and working actively and diligently to implement the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party and the subsequent plenary sessions of the Central Committee. In their work, cadres and the masses appear energetic, vigorous, and full of enthusiasm. The instructions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on accelerating socialist industrialization, gradually implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and raising the socialist consciousness of the working class have been warmly supported by the broad masses of Party members and the masses.

We are pleased to see that because the Polish United Workers' Party has implemented a correct line in line with Poland's specific conditions, the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Gomułka has high prestige among the masses, the Party and the masses have close and good relations, and the Party's influence has been strengthened. The Party's foundation among the masses has been greatly expanded, and the Party's organization has been further developed. And these, in turn, provide favorable conditions for the smooth implementation of the Party's line.

What impressed the delegation deeply was the rapid development and high technical level of Polish industry. The factories and mines we visited were all large-scale enterprises equipped with first-class technology. The production processes of the Oświęcim Chemical Plant and the Wierzchowice Sulphuric Acid Plant that we visited were highly automated; the Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta will expand its annual steel production from the current 1.5 million tons to more than 3 million tons by 1965. The Turów Power Plant in the province of Wrocław, with a planned generating capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts, will become one of the largest thermal power stations in Europe. The Gdańsk Shipyard builds 200,000 tons of seagoing vessels every year, and its scale is also quite large. During the visits, we deeply felt that, in terms of industrialization, we should redouble our efforts to reach such a level in our country. In terms of industrial technology, we still have a lot to learn from our Polish comrades. From the huge scale and development plans of these factories, it can be seen how great efforts the Polish Party has made and is still making to accelerate industrialization, and it has already achieved remarkable results.

Polish comrades told us that the five-year plan for national economic development from 1956 to 1960 will be overfulfilled in industry. Industrial production in the first quarter of this year increased by more than 10% compared with the same period last year, and the over-planned output of the coal industry reached 1.2 million tons, which had never happened before. The increase in production is mainly due to the improvement of labor productivity, rather than simply increasing the number of employees. This is a remarkable achievement in implementing the guidelines and policies stipulated by the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party and the subsequent plenary sessions of the Central Committee.

The Polish United Workers' Party has carried out effective political and ideological work in industrial and mining enterprises and among the masses. In the enterprises we visited, the leaders of the enterprise Party committees introduced to us how they conducted political and ideological work among the masses and how they carried out labor competitions in the enterprises. In the enterprises we visited, we saw that the workers were carrying out selfless labor with high labor enthusiasm.

The technical innovation movement launched in enterprises according to the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party has achieved fruitful results. When visiting the Zabrze Coal Mine in Katowice—the most developed industrial area in Poland—we saw an exhibition hall displaying various innovations and creations of coal miners and technicians related to coal mining equipment, from automatic coal mining machines to automatic fire extinguishing safety equipment. This is a manifestation of the high awareness and creativity of the liberated Polish miners and technicians.

From the end of last year, the work of revising labor quotas has been carried out universally in factories and mines, revising the old and unsuitable labor quotas and adopting new and higher quotas. Thanks to extensive and in-depth ideological education work among the workers, the work of revising quotas is now proceeding smoothly. The revision of quotas has promoted the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the widespread development of technological innovation.

Polish comrades attach great importance to giving play to the role of people. They emphasize the role of people's consciousness in production. Comrade Gomułka rightly pointed out when receiving the delegation: "People determine everything. People's consciousness and their understanding of the purpose of their activities are great material forces." Yes, it is precisely the Polish working class's understanding of its lofty goal of building socialism that is now becoming a great material force, promoting the rapid advancement of Poland's socialist construction.

In agriculture, according to the resolution of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, Polish comrades are currently carrying out socialist transformation in the countryside. The Polish Party has noticed the influence of farmers' traditional private ownership concepts and old habits, and patiently carries out work, and emphasizes combining socialist transformation with increasing agricultural production. This approach is completely understandable. The delegation visited agricultural production cooperatives in the provinces of Gdańsk and Lublin. These cooperatives fully demonstrated the great superiority of the collective economy over the individual economy. The yield per unit area of ​​the cooperatives was much higher than the average yield of the entire province. The income of cooperative members is also very high, and their lives are very good. Many local farmers expressed their willingness to join the cooperative. Judging from the peasant masses the delegation came into contact with, they are very longing for the cooperative. In the first four months of this year, the cooperativization movement in Poland has made great progress. Two hundred and forty new cooperatives were established in four months, which is almost equal to the total number of new cooperatives established last year. This is a clear proof that farmers yearn for cooperatives.

The resolution of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party correctly pointed out: "Only the socialist transformation of the countryside on the principle of production cooperation can guarantee the continuous growth of agricultural production, guarantee the improvement of rural cultural welfare, guarantee the full utilization of modern agricultural science and technology achievements, and completely eliminate social inequality and exploitation in the countryside."

The cooperatives, which are not yet in the majority in the countryside, point out the broad road of socialist transformation for Polish agriculture with their achievements. We are deeply convinced that under the correct guidance of the Polish United Workers' Party on the socialist transformation of agriculture, this only correct path of agricultural collectivization will surely achieve final victory in the Polish countryside.

The people of China and Poland have a long and deep friendship. After both our countries became socialist countries, on the basis of common goals, common Marxist-Leninist thought, and common proletarian internationalist principles, this friendship has become more consolidated and developed. This friendship is manifested in mutual support in international activities, in the many mutual friendly visits of leaders of the two parties, the two governments, and various social organizations, and in close cooperation in economic and cultural aspects. All these have greatly strengthened our common cause of building socialism and defending peace, and strengthened and promoted understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

During the delegation's visit, the Polish people showed a high degree of internationalist spirit to the Chinese Party delegation, and a fraternal and friendly feeling from the bottom of their hearts, which made us feel this friendship between the Chinese and Polish people even more deeply. We will never forget many scenes that show this noble and precious friendship. We regard this warm welcome and reception of the Polish people to the delegation as a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people who are working selflessly to build socialism, and as a vivid symbol of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Polish people and the strong unity of the socialist family on the basis of ideological consistency and common goals. In 1959, the Central Committee of the Polish Party, at the invitation of the Chinese Communist Party, sent a delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party to China for a visit. Following this visit, the Chinese Party delegation was very happy to be able to return the visit to Poland, personally understand the various aspects of Poland's socialist construction, and learn useful experience for us. This mutual understanding and exchange of experience will undoubtedly further enhance the unity and friendship between our two parties and the people of the two countries. This friendship is undoubtedly of extremely important significance for our common cause of building socialism and for strengthening the unity of the socialist camp.

People's Poland is advancing by leaps and bounds. The Chinese people are watching the victorious progress of Poland's construction with great enthusiasm, and are happy for every achievement it has made. The Chinese people are working hard to build their motherland. We know that our industrial level is still very low. In the construction, we have received the support and assistance of socialist brother countries including Poland. Similarly, we are willing to contribute our strength to other socialist brother countries as much as we can. This mutual support and close unity is a manifestation of the spirit of proletarian internationalism and a source of the powerful power of the socialist camp. Let the people of China and Poland advance hand in hand and victoriously in the common struggle to build socialism and defend peace!

    中波两国人民的永恒友谊
    中国共产党访波代表团团长　薄一波
    中国共产党代表团应波兰统一工人党的邀请，从1960年5月11日到5月26日在波兰人民共和国作了为期两周的友好访问。
    代表团访问了六个省份，六个大城市和若干乡村和市镇，参观了一系列的工厂、矿山，也参观了国营农场和农业生产合作社。
    代表团会见了波兰统一工人党中央第一书记哥穆尔卡同志，并且同中央领导同志作了多次会谈，在访问的省、市、工厂、矿山、合作社等地方，同地方和基层组织的党的负责同志进行了广泛的接触，兄弟般地交谈了情况和经验。两周的时间虽然不长，但我们十分感谢主人对日程的出色的安排，使代表团有可能在短的时间内，访问了尽可能多的地方，了解了工业、农业、文化教育和党的工作等各方面的工作情况。
    中国有句俗话说：“百闻不如一见”。中国党、中国人民对于波兰的社会主义建设一直是关怀的。对波兰党的工作、波兰社会主义建设和人民生活也有一定的了解。但是，只有在代表团有这样的机会对这样美丽的国家亲身访问的时候，这种了解的内容才更为丰富、更为生动，对于波兰社会主义建设、党的工作的各方面的情况，才认识得更深刻了。
    参观访问给我们的一个总的印象是：波兰各级党委、广大的党员和群众，都正在为贯彻执行波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会及其以后的几次中央全会的决议而团结一致积极努力地工作着。在工作中，干部和群众都显得有朝气，有干劲，生气勃勃，热情充沛。波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会决议中关于加速社会主义工业化、逐步实行农业的社会主义改造、提高工人阶级的社会主义觉悟的指示，得到了广大党员和群众的热烈拥护。
    我们高兴地看到，由于波兰统一工人党实行了正确的合乎波兰具体情况的路线，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的党中央在群众中有很高的威信，党和群众有着密切的、良好的关系，党的影响加强了。党在群众中的基础大大扩大，党的组织有了进一步的发展。而这些，又为顺利地贯彻执行党的路线提供了有利的条件。
    给代表团以深刻印象的是波兰工业的发展速度很快、技术水平很高。我们访问过的工厂、矿山，都是以头等技术装备起来的规模巨大的企业。我们参观过的奥斯威辛化工厂、维楚夫硫酸厂，生产过程都是高度自动化的；我们访问过的诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业到1965年将从现在的年产钢一百五十万吨扩大到年产钢三百多万吨。位于伏罗茨瓦夫省的土罗夫发电厂，计划发电能力为一百二十万瓩，它将成为欧洲的大火电站之一。革但斯克造船厂每年建造海船的吨位达二十万吨，规模也是相当巨大的。在参观访问中，我们深深感到，在工业化方面，为了使我国全国达到这样的水平，我们还应加倍地努力。在工业技术方面，我们还有很多东西应当向波兰同志们学习。从这些工厂的巨大规模和发展计划可以看出波兰党对于加速工业化，已经做了并且还正在做着如何巨大的努力，而且已经收到了显著的效果。
    波兰同志告诉我们，1956—1960年国民经济发展的五年计划在工业方面将超额完成。今年第一季度工业生产比去年同期增长10％以上，而其中煤炭工业超计划产量达一百二十万吨，这是过去未曾有过的情况。生产增加主要是靠提高劳动生产率，而不是单纯靠增加就业人数。这是执行波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会和以后的几次中央全会规定的方针政策的卓越成绩。
    波兰统一工人党在工矿企业中、在群众中进行了有成效的政治思想工作。在我们参观过的企业中，企业党委的领导都给我们介绍了他们在企业中如何对群众进行政治思想工作，如何开展劳动竞赛。在我们所参观过的企业中看到，工人们都以高度劳动热情进行着忘我的劳动。
    根据波兰统一工人党四中全会决议在企业中开展的技术革新运动已经取得丰硕的成果。在访问位于卡托维兹——波兰工业最发达的地区——的萨布热煤矿时，我们看到一个展览馆，陈列着煤矿工人、技术人员的各种有关采煤设备的多种多样的革新和创造，从自动采煤机直到自动灭火的安全设备无所不有。这是解放了的波兰矿工、技术人员高度觉悟和创造性的表现。
    由去年年底开始在厂矿中普遍进行了修改劳动定额工作。修改旧的不适用了的劳动定额，采用新的比较高的定额。由于广泛深入地对工人群众进行了思想教育工作，修改定额的工作现在正在顺利地进行。修改定额推动了劳动生产率的继续提高和技术革新的广泛发展。
    波兰同志非常重视发挥人的作用。强调人的觉悟在生产中的作用。哥穆尔卡同志在接见代表团时正确地指出：“人决定一切，人的觉悟，他对自己活动目的的了解，是伟大的物质力量。”是的，正是波兰工人阶级对自己的崇高的建设社会主义的目的的了解，现在正成为伟大的物质力量，推动着波兰的社会主义建设事业迅速前进。
    在农业方面，根据波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会决议，波兰同志目前正在农村中开展社会主义改造工作。波兰党注意到农民的传统的私有观念和旧的习惯势力的影响，耐心地进行工作，并强调把社会主义改造同增加农业生产结合起来，这种作法是完全可以理解的。代表团在革但斯克和卢布林两省都参观过农业生产合作社。这些合作社充分地显示出了集体经济对于个体经济的巨大优越性。合作社单位面积产量都比全省平均产量高出很多。合作社社员收入也很高，生活很好。当地很多农民表示愿意加入合作社，从代表团接触到的农民群众看来，他们对合作社是十分向往的。今年头四个月，全波兰合作化运动有了较大的进展，四个月中成立了二百四十个新社，几乎等于去年新成立的合作社的总和，这就是农民向往合作社的一个明显证明。
    波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会决议正确地指出：“只有在生产合作化原则上的农村社会主义改造才能保证农业生产的不断增长，保证农村文化福利的提高，保证充分利用现代的农业科学技术成就和完全消灭农村中的社会不平等和剥削现象。”
    农村中暂时还不占多数的合作社，以它们的成就给波兰农业指出社会主义改造的康庄大道。我们深信，在波兰统一工人党对农业社会主义改造的正确方针指导之下，农业集体化的这条唯一正确的道路一定会在波兰农村中取得最终的胜利。
    中波两国人民有着悠久的深厚的友谊，当我们两国都成为社会主义国家以后，在共同的目标、共同的马克思列宁主义思想、共同的无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，这种友谊更加巩固、更加发展了。这种友谊表现在国际活动中的相互支援，表现在两党、两国政府领导人和各种社会团体的多次的相互的友好访问，表现在经济、文化方面的密切合作。所有这些，都极大地加强了我们的建设社会主义和保卫和平的共同事业，加强和促进了两国人民间的了解和友谊。
    在代表团访问期间，波兰人民对中国党代表团表现出来的高度的国际主义精神，出自内心的兄弟般的友好感情，使我们对中波两国人民的这种友谊感觉得更为深切。许多表现出这种崇高的、珍贵的友情的场面，我们永远不能忘记。我们把波兰人民对于代表团的这种热情欢迎和接待，看成是对于正以忘我劳动建设社会主义的中国人民的莫大的鼓舞和支持，看成是中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊和在思想一致、目标一致的基础上的社会主义大家庭的坚强团结的生动象征。1959年波兰党中央曾应中国共产党的邀请，派出了波兰统一工人党代表团到中国来进行访问。继这种访问之后，中国党代表团十分高兴能够回访波兰，亲自了解波兰社会主义建设各方面的情况，学习对我们有益的经验。这种相互了解，相互交流经验，无疑地将更进一步增进我们两党、两国人民的团结和友谊，这种友谊对于我们建设社会主义的共同事业，对于加强社会主义阵营的团结，无疑地有着异常重要的意义。
    人民波兰正在一日千里地前进。中国人民以极大的热情注视着波兰建设的胜利进展，并以它的每一项成就而感到高兴。中国人民正在努力建设自己的祖国。我们知道，我们的工业水平还很低。在建设中，我们得到了社会主义兄弟国家包括波兰在内的支持和援助。同样，凡是我们力所能及的，也愿意对其他社会主义的兄弟国家贡献我们的力量。这种相互支持和紧密团结是无产阶级国际主义精神的表现，是社会主义阵营强大威力的泉源。让我们中波两国人民亲密无间地在建设社会主义、在保卫和平的共同斗争中永远胜利前进！
