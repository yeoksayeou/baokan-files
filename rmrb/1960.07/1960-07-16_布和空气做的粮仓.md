　　Grain Storage Made of Cloth and Air

　　The Soviet Central Research Institute for Building Structures has created an inflatable grain storage facility. The main building materials are rubberized cotton cloth and air. The lower part of the inflatable grain storage is made of two layers of relatively sturdy cloth, and later it will be made of synthetic materials such as Kapron and nylon.

　　An inflatable grain storage facility that can hold nearly 550 tons of grain, when folded, is only slightly larger than one cubic meter. It can be inflated with a low-pressure blower or an ordinary air collector, and the latter can be used to constantly maintain the necessary pressure. The grain is loaded into the storage facility using ordinary conveyors or pneumatic conveyors through so-called "appendices." In order to evenly distribute the grain inside the storage facility, special conveying devices can be installed inside.

　　The experimental inflatable grain storage facility has a volume of 1,500 cubic meters and is six meters high, and each can hold 3,000 to 3,500 tons of grain.

　　Grain stored in the "silver tent" will not spoil throughout the year. When the temperature is below minus 25 degrees Celsius, it is only necessary to increase the air pressure inside the storage wall.

    布和空气做的粮仓
    苏联中央建筑结构研究所制成了一种充气粮仓。主要的建筑材料是上了橡胶的棉布和空气。充气粮仓的下部是两层比较结实的布做的，以后则将用卡普隆、尼龙等合成材料来做。
    一个能装近五百五十吨粮食的充气粮仓，折叠起来只比一立方米较大一点。它可以用低压鼓风机或普通集风器充气，并可用后者来经常保持必要的压力。粮食装仓工作用普通输送机或气动输送机通过所谓“阑尾”来进行。为了使仓内粮食分布均匀，里面可以安装专门的输送装置。
    试验用的充气粮仓的容积为一千五百立方米，高六米，每个可以装三千到三千五百吨粮食。
    装在“银色帐篷”里的粮食一年四季都不会坏。在温度低于零下二十五度的情况下，只需增加仓壁内空气的压力。
