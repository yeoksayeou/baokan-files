The Omani people's struggle against British aggression and for independence and freedom has won the heartfelt admiration and deep sympathy of people around the world. A month ago, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization announced that it would designate July 18 this year as "Oman Day," calling on Asian and African countries to launch various activities on this day to express their support for the Omani people. The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity yesterday sent a telegram to Vice Imam Halse of Oman, expressing sincere admiration and respect to the heroic and unyielding Omani people.

Oman is located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Because it is located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf in the north and the Arabian Sea in the east, and occupies an important strategic position in the Middle East, the British imperialists, who were frantically plundering colonies as early as the end of the eighteenth century, extended their aggressive claws to it and established colonial rule there.

For more than a century, the Omani people have been fighting one after another to break free from the shackles of slavery. In 1913, the Omani people established the Imamate of Oman in an armed uprising, forcing British imperialism to recognize its independent status in 1920. In recent years, in order to suppress the rising anti-colonialist wave in the Middle East, maintain its remaining colonial rule near the Persian Gulf, and especially to seize the rich oil reserves discovered near the Buraimi Oasis in Oman in 1949, Britain brazenly commanded the troops of its puppet Sultan of Muscat to launch an attack on the Omani people at the end of 1955. In July 1957, in order to resist aggression, the Omani people began a large-scale nationwide uprising against Britain and its puppets, quickly defeating the Sultan of Muscat's army and once recovering important towns such as the capital Nizwa and vast territories.

The victory of the Omani people alarmed British imperialism, and it openly dispatched British troops to attack the Omani people directly. The British colonialists once thought that by relying on their modern weapons and large-scale massacres, they could suppress the Omani people's resistance in just a month or two. However, from 1957 to the present, although imperialism has dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops to the land of Oman, using jet planes, napalm bombs, new tanks, various artillery and rocket weapons, and even openly violated international law and carried out germ warfare, it has never been able to subdue the Omani people. As Imam Ghalib bin Ali of Oman said: "Our people will never surrender to any imperialist forces... Our people will defend their great motherland until the last drop of blood is shed." For three years, the Omani people have been holding high the banner of striving for independence with this heroic spirit, stubbornly fighting in the Green Mountains area, and persisting in using guerrilla warfare to eliminate the enemy.

In Britain's aggression against Oman, American imperialism also played a shameful role. It not only supported Britain's massacre of the Omani people with a large amount of ammunition and equipment, but is also ambitiously trying to gain a foothold in Oman, attempting to gradually replace Britain's colonial position. Vice Imam Halse of Oman once revealed the dirty deal between former US Secretary of State Dulles and Britain in London at the end of July 1957 to reach an understanding on the invasion of Oman: the right to administer Oman belongs to Britain, and the right to exploit oil belongs to the United States. However, in the face of the awakened Omani people, all the conspiracies of imperialism will never succeed. The evil activities of American imperialism can only arouse greater indignation and hatred among the Omani people.

The struggle of the Omani people is a just struggle. It has won the widespread sympathy and support of Asian, African countries and the people of the world. The people of our country firmly support the Omani people's struggle for liberation, severely condemn the imperialist crimes of aggression, and resolutely demand that imperialism immediately stop the massacre of the Omani people and immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from Oman and the Arabian Peninsula. We believe that as long as the Omani people continue to hold high the banner of striving for independence, make persistent efforts, and persist in the struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Omani people.

### 阿曼人民争取独立自由的斗争

　　阿曼人民争取独立自由的斗争
    阿曼人民反抗英国侵略、争取独立自由的斗争，获得世界各国人民的衷心敬佩和深切同情。一个月前，亚非人民团结组织书记处宣布把今年的7月18日定为“阿曼日”，号召亚非各国在这一天展开各种活动，表示他们对于阿曼人民的支持。中国亚非团结委员会已在昨天致电阿曼副教长哈尔塞，向英勇不屈的阿曼人民表示衷心的钦佩和敬意。
  阿曼位于阿拉伯半岛东南部，由于它北扼波斯湾口，东临阿拉伯海，在中东地区处于重要的战略地位，远在十八世纪末叶，疯狂向外掠夺殖民地的英帝国主义就向它伸出侵略的魔掌，在那里建立了殖民统治。
    一个多世纪以来，阿曼人民为了挣断奴役的锁链，始终都在前仆后继地进行着斗争。1913年，阿曼人民在武装起义中成立了阿曼伊斯兰教长国，迫使英帝国主义不得不在1920年承认它的独立地位。近年来，英国为了镇压中东地区日益高涨的反殖民主义浪潮，保住它残存于波斯湾附近的殖民统治，特别是为了攫取1949年在阿曼布赖米绿洲附近发现的丰富的石油储藏，就悍然指挥它的傀儡马斯喀特苏丹的军队，在1955年底向阿曼人民发动进攻。1957年7月，阿曼人民为了反抗侵略，开始了全国范围的反对英国及其傀儡的大规模起义，迅速地击溃了马斯喀特苏丹的军队，并一度收复了首府尼兹瓦等重要城镇和广大领土。
    阿曼人民的胜利使英帝国主义惊惶失措，它公然直接出动英国军队向阿曼人民进攻。英国殖民者曾经以为，凭借着它的现代化武器和大规模屠杀，就可以在短短的一两个月内把阿曼人民的反抗镇压下去。然而，从1957年到现在，尽管帝国主义在阿曼的土地上出动了上十万兵力，使用了喷气式飞机、凝固汽油弹、新型坦克、各种大炮和火箭武器，甚至公然违犯国际公法进行了细菌战，但是，它始终不能使阿曼人民屈服。正如阿曼教长加利卜·本·阿里所说：“我们的人民决不会向任何帝国主义势力投降，……我们的人民将保卫他们伟的大祖国，直到流尽最后一滴血。”三年来，阿曼人民正是以这种英雄气概，始终高举争取独立的旗帜，顽强地转战于绿山地区，坚持以游击战争来消灭敌人。
    在英国对阿曼的侵略中，美帝国主义也扮演了可耻的角色。它不仅以大量弹药和装备来支持英国屠杀阿曼人民，并且正在野心勃勃地向阿曼插足，企图逐步取代英国的殖民地位。阿曼副教长哈尔塞就曾揭露，美国前国务卿杜勒斯在1957年7月底到伦敦同英国就侵略阿曼的行动取得谅解的肮脏交易：在阿曼的管理权归英国，石油开采权归美国。但是，在觉醒了的阿曼人民面前，帝国主义的一切阴谋是绝不会得逞的。美帝国主义的罪恶活动，只能激起阿曼人民的更大愤慨和仇恨。
    阿曼人民的斗争是正义的斗争。它得到了亚非各国和世界人民的广泛同情和支持。我国人民坚决支持阿曼人民争取解放的斗争，严厉谴责帝国主义的侵略罪行，并坚决要求帝国主义立即停止对阿曼人民的屠杀，立即从阿曼和阿拉伯半岛撤出它的侵略军队。我们相信，只要阿曼人民继续高举争取独立的旗帜，再接再厉，坚持斗争，最后的胜利就必然属于英勇的阿曼人民。
        （尔）
