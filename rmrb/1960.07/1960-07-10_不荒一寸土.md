    Not a Single Inch of Land Left Uncultivated
    Sun Yuedong
    Wusheng is a good place,
    The Jialing River flows through the territory,
    Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land with beautiful scenery,
    The People's Commune is like the sun...
    Coming to Wusheng County, one hears this song everywhere.
    Yes, Wusheng is a good place, and the scenery of Wusheng has captivated tens of thousands of visitors from all over. Here, I won't write about the towering oil derricks, the collective canteens with fragrant food, the semi-mechanized pig farms, or the Yankou Grain Station, a national model in finance and trade. I want to write about the Wusheng field scenery painted by the efforts of the county's 500,000 people.
    After entering the hilly area of Wusheng by car, you can see slogans written in large white characters on the rooftops: "Increase Intercropping, Utilize Every Patch," "Seize the Time to Increase Planting, Evergreen in All Seasons." After walking through Wusheng, you really see the facts of "Utilize Every Patch" and "Evergreen in All Seasons." Look, the mountains, the gullies, in front of and behind houses, on field ridges, along roadsides, are all covered with crops. Even a field ridge that can only be walked on by one person is utilized. It seems like only a tiny bit of space, and some people neglect its potential value because it is narrow, but after coming to Wusheng, people realize how much loss this can cause. Field ridges and roadsides are all planted with corn and sorghum, surrounding one rice paddy after another; the sides of the ridges are densely planted with soybeans, peas, kidney beans, mung beans, and the like. The farmers of Wusheng County are truly good at fully utilizing the land. Where they have increased the planting of tall-stalk crops, they also plant pumpkins, string beans, cowpeas, etc. underneath, letting the pumpkin vines crawl on the ground and the string beans and cowpea vines entwine and climb up the sorghum or corn stalks. At the foot of a mountain in Yankou Commune, I found that the corn was growing sparsely, with pumpkin vines crawling on the ground. I thought: why are the crops here still missing patches, like a bald head, probably because the work is lagging behind; who knew that as I approached, it turned out to be a rocky mountain, covered with large stones. Wherever there was soil, corn was planted, and pumpkins were planted in the cracks between the rocks. People told me that in the past, only weeds could grow here, but now the mountain's appearance is completely different. The edges of ditches and canals are also planted with melons, beans, sorghum, corn, and so on; people may think that increasing planting is only to this extent, but in fact it is not. Here, farmers even make full use of the space above the ditches and canals. They use bamboo poles or branches to build frames from both banks, allowing melon and bean vines to climb up. In this way, they can produce more melons and beans and reduce the evaporation of canal water. The increase in planting in Wusheng County has truly become "no soil is left ungreen, all mountains are green." It is said that a leading comrade from a certain county, after visiting Wusheng, immediately told the cadres in his own county about the increased planting situation in Wusheng by long-distance telephone. He said: Crops are growing everywhere, and even a field ridge to stand on cannot be found.
    In Wusheng County, there is also a noteworthy phenomenon, which is sweet potatoes and corn "becoming in-laws." Almost all cornfields are intercropped with sweet potatoes. Of course, it would also be correct to say that sweet potato fields are intercropped with corn, because these two crops are rarely planted separately. Tall-stalk corn and creeping sweet potatoes are a perfect match, they grow simultaneously up and down, without interfering with each other, working together to increase the yield per unit area.
    In order to increase grain production, the farmers of Wusheng County have overcome various difficulties in increasing planting. They are unwilling to let the two or three zhang high hanging cliffs remain idle and unused, so they tie up high ladders and sow the seeds; some land is so high that they even tie ropes around their waists and hang in mid-air to sow seeds on the cliffs. In some places, the soil layer is too thin, all stony ground, even weeds are hard to grow on the stone slabs, the farmers then carry soil from other places, pile them into heaps, apply fertilizer, and sow seeds; in some places the shale is weathered, but digging is too hard, they use steel chisels to drill holes and blast out the窝穴 (wo xue - planting pits). People's soaring enthusiasm has added the most beautiful strokes to the Wusheng scenery.
    The scenery of Wusheng is good. This is drawn by the county's 500,000 people under the glorious illumination of the General Line, taking great leaps forward, with the magnificent brush of the People's Commune.

    不荒一寸土

    武胜是个好地方
    境内流过嘉陵江
    良田万顷风光好
    人民公社像太阳……
    来到武胜县，到处都听到人们唱这支歌。
    是的，武胜是个好地方，武胜的风光迷住了成千上万的各地参观者。这里，我不写那些矗入云霄的石油井塔，不写那些饭菜喷香的集体食堂，不写那些实现半机械化的养猪场，不写那作为全国财贸红旗的沿口粮站。我要写那由全县五十万人的努力而描绘出来的武胜田野风光。
    坐车进入丘陵区的武胜境内之后，就看到房顶写着斗大的白字标语：“增种间种、见缝插针”“抓紧增种、四季常青”。在武胜境内走过一遍之后，真的看到了“见缝插针”“四季常青”的事实。看吧，满山、满沟、屋前、屋后、田埂、地边、道路两旁，全都长满了庄稼。一条只能单人行走的田埂也利用起来，看起来才不过多么点点地方，有些人正因为它窄小而忽略了它的可利用价值，但，来到武胜看过之后，人们才发现这会造成多大的损失。田埂上、道路旁，全部生长着玉米、高粱，围绕着一块又一块的稻田；田埂的壁上，密密麻麻全是种的黄豆、青豆、饭豆、绿豆之类。武胜县的农民真会充分利用土地，在增种高秆作物的地方，他们又在底下种上南瓜、四季豆、豇豆等等，让南瓜藤在地下爬，让四季豆、豇豆的蔓缠绕着高粱或玉米向上爬。在沿口公社的一座山下，我发现玉米长得零零落落，地上爬着南瓜藤，心想：这里的庄稼为什么还有缺窝，像癞子的脑壳似的，大概是工作落后了；谁知待我走近一看，原来是一座石头山，遍山是大石块，凡是有泥土的地方都种上玉米，南瓜是种在石头缝里的，人们告诉我，过去这里能够生长的，只有野草，现在山的面目全非了。沟边、渠旁，也都种满了瓜豆、高粱、玉米等等；人们也许以为增种也不过如此程度了吧，其实不然，这里农民连沟渠上面的空间也要充分利用。他们用竹竿或树枝从两岸搭成架，让瓜豆藤蔓爬上去。这样，既可以多结瓜豆，又可以减少渠水蒸发。武胜县的增种，真成为“无土不绿，有山皆青”。据说某县的一位领导同志，来武胜参观以后，立即把武胜的增种情况用长途电话告诉自己县里的干部，他说：到处都长满了庄稼，连一条立脚的田埂也无法找到。
    在武胜县，还有一种引人注意的现象，这就是红苕、玉米“搭着亲家”。几乎所有的玉米地里都间种红苕，当然，如果说成红苕地里间种玉米也无不可，因为很少把红苕、玉米这两种作物单独种植的。高秆的玉米，正好和爬蔓的红苕搭配在一起，它们上下同时长，各不相扰，齐为提高单位面积产量而努力。
    武胜县的农民为了多增产粮食，在增种上克服了种种困难。他们不愿让二、三丈高的悬岩陡壁空闲着而不利用，于是扎上高梯，把种子播下去；有的地高，甚至用绳子把腰系住，吊在半空中向悬岩峭壁上播种。有些地方土层太薄，全是石骨子地，甚至野草难生一棵的石板，农民们便从别处挑了土来，堆成一堆堆，施上肥料，播下种子；有的地方页岩风化，但挖掘太硬，他们便用钢钎凿眼，爆破出播种的窝穴。人们冲天的干劲，为武胜风光增添了最美的几笔。
    武胜风光好。这是全县五十万人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，迈开大跃进的阔步，用人民公社的雄伟大笔勾划出来的。
