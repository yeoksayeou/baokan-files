(Dispatch from our newspaper in Xi'an on July 7th) The Red Flag Unit and Red Flag Pacesetter movement is underway in various parts of Shaanxi Province. A large number of cadres, taking outstanding cadre models as their example, are going to the most difficult, most arduous, and weakly led grassroots to work, so that the revolutionary traditions and fine work styles of cadres closely linking with the masses, working hard and living simply, immersing themselves in hard work, and serving the people well as public servants, are being further carried forward and developed throughout the province.

This movement started in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi and then rapidly spread throughout the province; it expanded from special district and county-level cadres to general cadres, and from rural areas to various fronts such as industry, transportation, commerce, and culture and health. As early as the end of last year, Gao Yi, a cadre of the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in northern Shaanxi, and Liu Shijie, a cadre of the Zhidan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the Yan'an area, voluntarily applied to work in the most difficult, most arduous, and remote grassroots. They ate, lived, worked, discussed, and studied with the commune members and cadres. In less than half a year, these two previously backward teams became red flag teams in all aspects of work. The local Party committee established them as models among cadres, calling on all cadres to learn from them and implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." This quickly had a significant impact in northern Shaanxi and throughout the province, and a large number of cadres went to work in the most difficult and arduous grassroots. In the two special districts of northern Shaanxi alone, more than 1,100 special district and county-level cadres have voluntarily gone to work long-term in these grassroots units. In Ningqiang County, in the Dabashan mountainous area of southern Shaanxi, after ten Gao Yi and Liu Shijie-style cadres such as Mao Huayu emerged, a "Ten Good Cadres" movement was immediately launched throughout the entire special district. These ten goods are: good at listening to the Party and implementing policies; clear views and good class stand; selfless devotion to the public interest and a good overall perspective; soaring drive and good production; diligence and thrift and good participation in labor; solid work and good completion of tasks; selflessness and good mass viewpoint; humble attitude and good democratic style; advancing in the face of difficulties and good at creation; striving for progress and good at the spirit of learning. To date, more than 90,000 cadres at all levels and on all fronts throughout the province have gone deep into the lower levels for long and short periods.

The vast numbers of cadres, going deep into the grassroots, diligently serving the people, participating in productive labor, and solving every specific problem in production, have had a profound impact on the masses. The face of production and the mental outlook of the masses have been completely renewed in a short period of time. Jia Huai'en, director of the Shenmu County Public Security Bureau, returned to Jiajiagou Village, where the Party established the first branch in the Shen (mu) Fu (gu) area in 1928. On the one hand, he used his actions of eating, living, working, discussing, and consulting with the commune members to motivate the masses. On the other hand, he and the masses opened a revolutionary recollection course at the night Party school, inviting comrades working outside to introduce the situation of national construction. In this way, the masses showed an even higher revolutionary fighting spirit in the struggle with nature than during the Land Revolution. Jia Zhengshi, the oldest Party member during the Land Revolution, although already disabled, also led a shock team of 24 commune members to build a canal and dig three wells in just eight days, irrigating more than 60 mu of land. Liu Zhaofu, secretary of the Shimen Commune Party Committee in Xunyi County, always worked with the commune members, researching and solving specific problems. When the canteen of the Dongfeng No. 12 team was not good, he personally served as the food director. When a vegetable cutting machine was needed, he and the carpenter went to visit and manufacture it, completing twelve technical innovations in the canteen. The food was very good, and the number of people entering the canteen increased from more than 80 to more than 700. During the drought resistance, he and the commune members watched and dug 300 large and small springs, solving the problem of irrigation water shortage. The masses loved him very much, calling him "Four Professions Master" (i.e., agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations), "Eight-Character Expert" (i.e., the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture), and "Confidant." He himself deeply realized that influencing the masses with his actual actions was more powerful than making several mobilization reports. Under his leadership, the work of this commune was done very well. After 512 cadres in Zhen'an County went deep into the most difficult and weakly led grassroots, because they carried forward the Party's fine work style, the face of the county's 337 backward production teams quickly changed, and the daily progress of drought resistance and sowing increased by two and a half times.

Recently, in order to better combine the Red Flag Pacesetter and Red Flag Unit competition movement carried out among cadres, so as to further carry forward the Party's inherent revolutionary traditions and fine work style among all cadres, various localities and units have established models among local cadres, conducting evaluations, summaries, and exchanges of experience. The Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League successively held symposiums for cadres who went to the grassroots, summarizing and exchanging work experience. The Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized these cadres to report to cadres of various units in the entire special district. In six units alone, 556 cadres applied to go to the most arduous grassroots and dedicate everything to the socialist construction of the mountainous areas. The Hanzhong area also launched an evaluation of ten good cadres. Ningqiang County selected 202 Red Flag Units and 5,531 Red Flag Pacesetters. Among the 45 cadres in the Xinpu management area of ​​Puzhen Commune, 11 ten-good cadres and 23 outstanding cadres were evaluated. The evaluation greatly promoted the Ten Good Cadres movement. Ma Zhanlong, deputy secretary of the Chengguan Commune Party Committee, never left his basket, and picked up more than 3,000 jin of manure in May and June.

    密切联系群众　艰苦朴素　埋头苦干　作好人民勤务员
    革命传统在陕西发扬光大
    老根据地陕北发起的红旗单位、红旗手运动迅速扩展到全省
    九万干部纷纷深入到最困难、最艰苦、领导薄弱的基层去工作
    本报西安7日电　陕西省各地开展红旗单位和红旗手运动，大批干部以优秀干部标兵为榜样，纷纷到最困难、最艰苦、领导薄弱的基层去工作，使干部密切联系群众、艰苦朴素、埋头苦干、为人民服务作好人民的勤务员等革命传统和优良作风，在全省进一步发扬光大。
    这个运动是从革命老根据地的陕北开始的，以后迅速扩展到全省；由专、县级干部扩大到一般干部，由农村扩大到工业、交通运输、商业和文教卫生等各个战线。早在去年年底，陕北中共榆林地委干部高毅和延安专区中共志丹县委干部刘士杰，自动申请到最困难、最艰苦的偏僻基层去工作，他们和社员、干部同吃同住同劳动同商量同学习，不到半年时间，这两个原来的后进队就变成为各项工作的红旗队。当地党委把他们树为干部中的标兵，号召全体干部向他们学习，执行毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，很快在陕北和全省发生了重大影响，大批干部都纷纷到最困难、最艰苦的基层去工作。陕北两个专区仅是专、县级干部自动到这些基层单位长期工作的已达一千一百多人。在陕南大巴山山区的宁强县涌现了毛化育等十个高毅、刘士杰式的干部后，全专区立即掀起了一个十好干部运动。这十好是：听党的话，执行政策好；观点明确，阶级立场好；大公无私，整体观念好；干劲冲天，生产搞的好；勤俭朴素，参加劳动好；工作扎实，完成任务好；舍己为人，群众观念好；态度谦虚，民主作风好；见难而进，勇于创造好；力求进步，学习精神好。到目前为止，全省各级、各个战线长期短期深入到下层的干部已达九万多人。
    广大干部深入基层，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，参加生产劳动并解决每一个生产中的具体问题，这就在群众中发生了深远的影响，生产面貌和群众的精神面貌，在短期里就焕然一新。神木县公安局长贾怀恩，回到党在1928年建立的神（木）府（谷）地区第一个支部的贾家沟村工作，他一面用和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量的行动带动群众，一面和群众一起在夜党校开设革命回忆的课程，请外出工作同志介绍祖国建设情况，这样，群众在同自然斗争中又出现了比土地革命时代更为高涨的革命斗争劲头。土地革命时最老的党员贾正石，虽然已经残废，还领导着二十四名社员组成了突击队，只八天就修通一条水渠，打了三眼井，浇地六十多亩。?南县石门公社党委书记刘兆福，总是和社员一块劳动，研究和解决具体问题。东峰十二队的食堂不好，他就亲自当伙食主任，需要切菜机，自己就和木匠去参观、制造，完成了食堂十二项技术革新，饭菜很好，入食堂的由八十多人增加到七百多人。抗旱中他和社员一块看，一块挖了大小三百个水泉，解决了灌溉缺水问题。群众非常爱戴他，叫他“四业懂”（即农林牧副）、“八字通”（即农业八字宪法）、“知心人”。他自己也深深体会到用自己的实际行动影响群众，比做几次动员报告力量还大。在他的带动下，这个公社的工作做得很出色。镇安县五百一十二名干部深入到最困难、领导薄弱的基层后，因为发扬了党的这些优良作风，全县三百三十七个后进生产队的面貌迅速改变，抗旱播种日进度增加了两倍半。
    最近，为了更好的结合干部中开展的红旗手、红旗单位竞赛运动，以便把党固有的革命传统和优良作风在所有干部中进一步发扬光大，各地、各单位都在当地干部中树立了标兵，进行评比、总结和交流经验。中共榆林地委、共青团延安专区团委都相继举行了到基层去的干部的座谈会，总结交流了工作经验。中共榆林地委组织这些干部向全专区各单位干部作了报告，只是六个单位就有五百五十六个干部申请到最艰苦的基层去，把自己的一切献给山区社会主义建设。汉中专区也开展了十好干部的评比。宁强县评选出的红旗单位二百零二个、红旗手五千五百三十一人。铺镇公社新铺管区四十五个干部中评比出十一个十好干部和二十三个优秀干部。经过评比大大推广了十好干部运动。城关公社党委副书记马占龙肩不离筐，5、6两月就拾粪三千多斤。
