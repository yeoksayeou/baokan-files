Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Beijing's Party organizations have added new blood in the past year, with over 30,000 outstanding elements joining the Chinese Communist Party.

These new Party members have generally undergone long-term cultivation by the Party and have been rigorously tested in the rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the implementation of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the three red banners. They have a firm stance, can closely connect with the masses, and possess a relatively high level of communist consciousness. Most are advanced figures in production and work. According to statistics from Dongcheng District and four units including Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, advanced figures such as labor models, advanced producers, and red banner bearers account for 67% of the 1,017 new Party members accepted in the first half of this year.

Among these new Party members, many are outstanding figures on the industrial and agricultural production fronts. Yu Zhongfa, an old worker from the Beijing Electron Tube Factory who attended the Beijing Heroes' Meeting, has consistently worked actively, resolutely responded to the Party's call, and actively taken the lead in completing every task assigned by the Party. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, he motivated workers, overcame many difficulties, and completed many innovation projects, adding a large amount of wealth to the country. He usually helps veteran workers and new apprentices to improve their political awareness and selflessly teaches his skills to apprentices. Yuan Fenglan, nineteen years old, is the captain of the Fourth Production Team of the Lugouqiao Brigade of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in Fengtai District. She is active, responsible, connects with the masses, cares for the masses, participates in production, and leads production. Her annual attendance rate can maintain above 340 days. Since 1957, she has successively won the honorary title of Beijing Labor Model. Last year, when deep plowing the land, the production team she led continuously improved production efficiency, and the average number of acres of land deep-plowed per person per day was more than twice the level of the entire brigade.

Among the new Party members, there are also some activists on the cultural, educational, and health fronts. Wang Weihan, a physics teacher at Beijing No. 25 Middle School, and Zhou Yulan, a surgical nurse at the Children's Hospital, are both advanced workers who attended the National Cultural and Educational Heroes' Meeting. Wang Weihan resolutely implements the Party's education policy, diligently studies teaching materials, carefully tutors students, attaches importance to the combination of theory and practice, and has made good achievements through participating in labor and combining production with teaching. He is the head of the physics teaching and research group and can motivate all teachers in the group to study politics, maintain unity, and actively help other teachers. He also regularly insists on studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works and actively participates in labor training. Zhou Yulan has always worked diligently, listened to the Party, and actively responded to the Party's call in various movements, going wherever the Party points her. She has a high sense of responsibility towards sick children and tries every means to alleviate their pain. One burned child had a particularly swollen mouth, making it very difficult to eat and drink. In order to avoid increasing the child's pain, she and other comrades repeatedly studied and came up with a method of dripping liquid into the mouth with a Dakin tube, ensuring the child's nutrition. After the leadership transferred her to work in the burn rescue ward with more critically ill patients, she overcame difficulties with a responsible spirit and worked actively.

Among the vast number of employees in the city's commercial and service industries, there are also many outstanding individuals who have joined the Party for their selfless labor in the cause of socialist construction. An Qi, a foot repair worker at the Qinghua Bathhouse in Xuanwu District, has made extraordinary achievements in ordinary labor. He has diligently studied for a long time and mastered the technique of treating foot diseases. The masses call him "foot doctor," and several hospitals have hired him to treat foot diseases. In order to better serve the masses, he actively teaches his skills to apprentices.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels is actively and cautiously carrying out Party building work in various urban people's communes, further strengthening the Party's leadership over the various undertakings of the people's communes.

When urban people's communes were established in Chongqing this spring, many important departments in many communes did not have Party members at the time. With the rapid development of production, collective welfare, cultural and educational health undertakings, these communes needed to further strengthen the Party's leadership. Under the direct leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committee, the Party committees of various communes actively and cautiously carried out Party building work in combination with production and central tasks. At present, urban people's communes throughout the city have developed 449 Party members. Not only have Party committees been established in various communes, but also Party branches or groups have been established in many important production and collective welfare departments.

The establishment of these Party organizations has greatly strengthened the political and ideological leadership of various undertakings in the commune, effectively guaranteeing the consolidation of the commune and the development of various undertakings. After the Qixinggang People's Commune developed 51 Party members among its members, the political and ideological leadership of the commune was significantly strengthened. In the early stages of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the commune's electromechanical plant, many people believed that they were housewives, lacked technology and culture, and were afraid to engage in technical innovation. After the establishment of the Party group in the plant, the Party members resolutely implemented the instructions of the Party committee, helped the masses solve ideological problems, and three Party members were assigned to contract three workshops to carry out propaganda and mobilization among the masses. Li Shulan, a new Party member, was originally also a housewife and an apprentice. She took the lead in breaking down superstitions about technical innovation, actively studied, boldly innovated, and improved the process regulations, so that the efficiency of making flat-nosed pliers increased from more than 20 pairs per day to more than 400 pairs. She also realized the flat-nosed pliers production line together with others. This example greatly liberated the minds of the workers.

Most of the new Party members developed by various urban people's communes are housewives. Under the education of the Party, through various political movements, especially the Great Leap Forward and the Great Steel Smelting Movement in 1958, as well as participating in collective undertakings such as street production and life, their political awareness has rapidly improved and they have met the conditions for joining the Party. Qiu Xianzhen, the deputy director of the Shapingba People's Commune, used to be an illiterate housewife. After liberation, under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party, she has actively promoted the Party's propositions to the masses in the streets for ten years, and also organized the masses to run production and collective welfare undertakings. Since 1958, she has led the masses to start from scratch and established a large processing factory with four mechanized workshops, including electric milling wood powder and asbestos. She has also been tempered in these works and improved her political awareness. She was selected as a national activist in socialist construction for women and was admitted to the Party.

    首都党组织不断增添新的血液
    一年来三万多忠于人民埋头苦干的优秀分子入党
    重庆城市人民公社加强政治思想领导积极进行建党工作
    新华社30日讯　一年来，北京的党组织又增添了新的血液，有三万多名优秀分子加入了中国共产党。
    这些新党员一般都经过党的长期培养，并在整风运动、反右派斗争和总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的贯彻执行当中经受了严格的考验。他们立场坚定，能够密切联系群众，具有较高的共产主义觉悟，多数是在生产和工作中的先进人物。据东城区和石景山钢铁公司等四个单位统计，在今年上半年接收的一千零十七名新党员中，劳动模范、先进生产者和红旗手等先进人物占67％。
    在这些新党员中，许多人是工农业生产战线上的优秀人物。出席北京市群英会的北京电子管厂老工人虞中发，一贯积极劳动，坚决响应党的号召，积极带头完成党交给的每一项工作任务。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，带动职工，克服了许多困难，完成了不少革新项目，为国家增加了大量财富。他平时经常帮助老工人和新徒工提高政治觉悟，并且毫无保留地把自己的技术传授给徒工。十九岁的袁凤兰，是丰台区芦沟桥人民公社芦沟桥大队第四生产队的队长。她积极负责，联系群众，关心群众，参加生产，领导生产，每年出勤率都能保持三百四十天以上，从1957年以来连续获得了北京市劳动模范的光荣称号。去年深翻土地时，她所率领的生产队，由于不断提高生产效率，平均每人每日深翻地亩数比全大队水平高一倍以上。
    新党员中，还有些是文教卫生战线上的积极分子，北京市第二十五中学物理教员王维翰、儿童医院外科护士周玉兰，都是出席全国文教群英会的先进工作者。王维翰坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，刻苦钻研教材，认真辅导学生，重视理论联系实际，通过参加劳动，结合生产进行教学，做出了很好的成绩。他是物理教研组长，能带动全组教师学习政治，搞好团结，积极帮助其他教师。他还经常坚持学习马列主义和毛主席著作，积极参加劳动锻炼。周玉兰一贯埋头苦干，听党的话，在各项运动中，积极响应党的号召，党指到哪里就到哪里。她对病儿有高度的责任感，能千方百计地设法减轻病儿痛苦。有一个烫伤病儿，嘴肿得特别厉害，吃饭喝水都十分困难，她为了不再增加病儿的痛苦，和其他同志一起经过反复研究，想出用迪金氏管往嘴里滴入的办法，保证了病儿的营养。当领导上调她到急重病人较多的烫伤抢救病房工作以后，她更以负责精神克服困难，积极工作。
    在全市商业和服务行业广大职工中，也有不少为社会主义建设事业忘我劳动的优秀人物入了党。宣武区清华浴池修脚工人安起，在平凡的劳动中作出了不平凡的成绩。他长期刻苦钻研，掌握了医治脚病的技术，群众都称他“脚病大夫”，有几个医院聘请他去治脚病。他为了更好地为群众服务，积极把自己的技术传授给徒工。
    据新华社重庆30日电　重庆市的各级中共党委积极而慎重地在各城市人民公社中进行建党工作，进一步加强了党对人民公社各项事业的领导。
    重庆市今春建立城市人民公社的时候，不少公社的许多重要部门当时没有党员。而这些公社随着生产和集体福利、文教卫生事业的迅速发展，需要进一步加强党的领导。各个公社党委就在中共重庆市委和区委的直接领导下，结合生产和中心任务，积极而慎重地进行建党工作。目前，全市城市人民公社已经发展了党员四百四十九名，各个公社不仅建立了党委，而且在许多重要的生产和集体福利部门中建立了党的支部或小组。
    这些党组织的建立，大大加强了公社各项事业的政治思想领导，有力地保证了公社的巩固和各项事业的发展。七星岗人民公社在社员中发展了五十一名党员后，公社的政治思想领导显著加强。这个公社的机电厂在开展技术革新和技术革命运动初期，不少人认为自己是家庭妇女，没有技术和文化，不敢闹技术革新。这个厂建立了党小组后，党员们坚决贯彻党委指示，帮助群众解决思想问题，并且由三个党员分工包干三个车间向群众进行宣传鼓动。新党员李淑兰原来也是家庭妇女，又是学徒工。她带头破除对技术革新的迷信，积极钻研，大胆革新，改进了工艺规程，使作挫尖咀钳的工效由每天二十多把提高到四百多把，还同别人一起实现了尖咀钳生产作业线。这一事例，使职工们大大解放了思想。
    各城市人民公社发展的新党员，大多数是家庭妇女，她们在党的教育下，通过各种政治运动，特别是1958年的大跃进和大炼钢铁运动，以及参加街道生产、生活等集体事业的锻炼，政治觉悟很快提高，具备了入党条件。沙坪坝人民公社副主任丘显珍，过去是一字不识的家庭妇女。解放后，在党的不断培养、教育下，她十年如一日地在街道上积极向群众宣传党的主张，还组织群众举办生产和集体福利事业。1958年以来，她领导群众白手起家办起了一个目前具有电磨木粉、石棉等四个机械化车间的较大的加工厂。她也在这些工作中受到了锻炼，并且提高了政治觉悟，曾被评选为全国妇女的社会主义建设积极分子，并被吸收入党。
