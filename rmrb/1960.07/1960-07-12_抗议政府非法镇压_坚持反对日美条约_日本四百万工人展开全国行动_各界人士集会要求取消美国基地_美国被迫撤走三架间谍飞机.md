Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th. Four million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions launched a nationwide action today, protesting the Kishida government's suppression of patriotic workers participating in the movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Japanese traitorous Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, during his prolonged period of delaying his resignation, instructed state-owned railway companies and postal authorities to announce "punishments" for a large number of patriotic workers, and illegally arrested many workers and students.

The resolutions passed at workplace rallies held throughout Japan today emphasized that Japanese workers' actions against the new "Security Treaty" are legitimate and just. The resolutions stated that Japanese workers are determined to continue the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with dauntless spirit.

A delegation composed of workers and members of the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty also visited the state-owned railway company, postal authorities, the Metropolitan Police Department, and other relevant government departments today, protesting their suppression of the workers.

The 13th National Regular Congress of the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union issued a statement today protesting the Kishida government's suppression of the anti-American patriotic movement. The Congress issued instructions to its affiliated unions stating that electrical workers across the country should hold workplace rallies on the 14th and use refusal to work overtime from July 14th to 20th to protest the suppression of workers.

Ten thousand workers and people from all walks of life from the Miike Coal Mine, who are persisting in a long-term strike, held a rally today, declaring that they do not recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and oppose the Fukuoka District Court's "punishment" of the striking workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama announced today that the United States has been forced to withdraw three U-2 spy planes from Japan.

Fujiyama said that the Kishida government received a notification from U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II yesterday stating that, as of yesterday, three U-2 aircraft had been withdrawn from Japan.

Since the incident of U-2 spy planes stationed at U.S. military bases in Japan was revealed, the Japanese people have continuously launched powerful struggles demanding the immediate withdrawal of U-2 aircraft in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Yesterday, they held an unprecedented protest rally at the U.S. Atsugi Naval Air Facility, where U-2 aircraft are stationed.

In its notification to Japan, the United States concealed the purpose of its espionage activities, self-deprecatingly saying that the withdrawal of the spy planes was because "the meteorological observation work in Japan that U-2 aircraft had been engaged in had been completed several weeks ago."

Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, told reporters today that the United States' forced withdrawal of the notorious U-2 aircraft marks a victory in the Japanese people's long-term struggle to demand the withdrawal of all U.S. bases and U.S. troops from Japan.

Minakuchi emphasized that it was the collective action of the people that forced the United States to withdraw the spy planes from Japan. He urged people to pay attention to the new conspiracy of the United States: even if the United States withdraws the spy planes from Japan, it may bring them back into Japan again. Minakuchi said that the Japanese people should be vigilant about the actions of the United States and carry out an unyielding struggle to abolish all U.S. bases in Japan.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement today regarding the U.S. military's forced withdrawal of U-2 spy planes from Japan, pointing out that this is a victory for Japanese public opinion, and the Socialist Party will stand with the people of the country in the future to wage an unremitting struggle against U.S. military bases and to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance.

Hiromi Kawamura, Chairman of the Kanagawa Prefectural People's Council for the Abolition of the Security Treaty, said today that the citizens of Kanagawa have been fighting to withdraw U.S. U-2 aircraft. The fact that the U.S. military was forced to withdraw its spy planes means that we have achieved a victory.

He said that the people of Kanagawa Prefecture will resolutely fight to the end to abolish all U.S. military bases in the future.

Yoshio Minami, a spokesman for the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said that the United States' withdrawal of U-2 aircraft from Japan is the result of the Japanese people's resolute struggle.

He emphasized that U.S. imperialism will not abandon its war policy and stop espionage activities on its own, so "Sohyo" will continue to fight to smash the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and abolish U.S. military bases in Japan.

Minami said that although the United States has withdrawn U-2 aircraft from mainland Japan, there is still a danger of moving them to U.S. military bases in Okinawa and elsewhere to continue espionage activities. Therefore, the Japanese people must closely monitor, be vigilant, and strengthen their joint struggle with the people of Okinawa to force the U.S. military to remove its bases from Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. More than 1,500 women representatives from Kanagawa Prefecture held a meeting in Yamato City, where a U.S. military base is located, on the 10th. The conference unanimously passed a resolution resolutely demanding that the U.S. military and U.S. U-2 aircraft immediately withdraw from Japan.

The conference resolution also called for the immediate release of workers and students arrested for participating in anti-American patriotic demonstrations.

The conference also passed a resolution expressing opposition to the Kanagawa Prefectural Government's plan to implement a "performance evaluation" system on teachers starting September 1, which would restrict freedom of political thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th. Seven thousand workers and people from all walks of life in Iwakuni, where a U.S. Air Force base is located, held a rally and demonstration yesterday, declaring that they do not recognize the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the abolition of U.S. bases in Japan.

This rally was held as part of the 21st National Unified Action against the new "Security Treaty" which started on July 10th.

Representatives from five prefectures in the Chugoku region, including Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, participated in the rally. Japan Socialist Party member Hisao Kuroda, Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga, and representatives of the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty all spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to intensify the struggle against the new "Security Treaty."

The rally passed a resolution declaring that it does not recognize the new "Security Treaty," demanding the abolition of U.S. military bases, opposing the establishment of a Kishida-style cabinet, and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

After the meeting, the participants divided into ten teams and held a powerful demonstration near the Iwakuni base, shouting slogans such as "Abolish the Iwakuni atomic base," "U-2 jets get out of Japan," and "Get rid of Kishida and Sato."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th. Two hundred and five representatives from 116 "Associations to Protect Miike Coal Mine Workers" from all over Japan held a meeting in Omuta City on the 10th, summarizing the experience of supporting Miike coal mine workers in persisting in their strike and opposing layoffs, and discussing the future direction of the movement.

Takehiro Ebitani, Deputy Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), emphasized at the meeting that the Miike coal mine workers' all-out strike against layoffs has lasted for 166 days. During this period, workers and people from all walks of life donated 20 million yen (excluding donations from "Sohyo" and the coal miners' union) to support the heroic struggle of the Miike coal mine workers. He pointed out that the struggle of the Miike coal mine workers is related to the future of the Japanese labor movement, and it is of great significance to smash the conspiracy of Japanese monopoly capital to carry out so-called "corporate rationalization" in order to adapt to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty system."

Since the Miike coal mine workers launched a strike this spring, organizations supporting the Miike miners' strike have been established across Japan. As of July 10, 315 such organizations have been established, and more than 1,000 organizations are in the process of being formed.

The "Miike Problem Discussion Group for Cultural Figures" was established in Tokyo on the 9th. One hundred and thirty well-known figures from all walks of life, including writers, commentators, and university professors, participated in the discussion group.

The discussion group decided to write a letter to the Miike Coal Mine Union to encourage the workers' fighting spirit and will submit a letter of protest to the Metropolitan Police Department and Mitsui Mining Company.

The discussion group also decided to send five representatives to Omuta City to express their condolences to the workers in the struggle.

　　抗议政府非法镇压　坚持反对日美条约
　　日本四百万工人展开全国行动
　　各界人士集会要求取消美国基地　美国被迫撤走三架间谍飞机
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：属于日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会的四百万工人今天展开全国性行动，抗议岸信介政府镇压参加反对日美“安全条约”运动的爱国工人。日本卖国首相岸信介在他拖延下台期间，指使国营铁道公司和邮政当局等部门宣布“处分”大批爱国工人，并且非法逮捕了不少工人和学生。
    今天在日本各地举行的工作场所集会上通过的决议强调说，日本工人反对新“安全条约”的行动是合法的和正义的。决议表示，日本工人决心以大无畏精神继续进行反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    由工人和阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议成员组成的代表团，今天还访问了国营铁道公司、邮政当局、警视局和其它有关政府部门，抗议它们对工人们的镇压。
    全国电气通讯工会第十三次全国定期大会今天发表声明，抗议岸信介政府镇压反美爱国运动。大会向所属各工会发出指示说，全国电气工人要在14日举行工作场所大会，从7月14日到20日用拒绝加班方式来抗议镇压工人。
    坚持长期罢工的三池煤矿工人和各界人士一万人，今天举行大会，宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”，反对福冈地方法院“处分”罢工工人。”
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎今天宣布，美国已被迫从日本撤走三架U—2型间谍飞机。
    藤山说，岸信介政府昨天接到美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二的通知说，到昨天为止，已经有三架U—2型飞机撤离日本。
    自从在日本的美军基地驻有U　—2型间谍飞机事件被揭露以来，日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中，不断地展开了要求美军立即撤走U—2型飞机的强有力斗争；昨天，他们又在停有U—2型飞机的美军厚木基地举行了声势空前的抗议大会。
    美国在给日本的通知里掩盖间谍活动的目的，自我解嘲地说什么撤走间谍飞机是由于“已经在几个星期以前完成了U—2型飞机曾经从事的在日本进行气象观测的工作”。
    阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三今天对新闻记者们发表谈话时指出，美国被迫撤走臭名昭彰的U—2型飞机，标志着日本人民要求一切美国基地和美国军队撤出日本的长期斗争的一个胜利。
    水口宏三强调说，迫使美国把间谍飞机撤出日本的是人民的集体行动。他要人们注意美国的新阴谋说：即使美国把间谍飞机从日本撤走，但它可能再度运进日本。水口宏三说，日本人民应当对美国的行动保持警惕，并且为取消美国在日本的所有基地而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    日本社会党今天就美军被迫从日本撤走U—2型间谍飞机发表声明指出，这是日本公众舆论的胜利，社会党今后将同全国人民在一起，为反对美国军事基地和粉碎日美军事同盟而进行不懈斗争。
    争取废除“安全条约”神奈川县民会议议长河村宏弥今天发表谈话指出，神奈川市民一直在为争取撤走美国U—2型飞机而斗争。美军被迫撤走它的间谍飞机这件事，意味着我们取得一次胜利。
    他说，神奈川县民今后将为撤销一切美军基地而坚决斗争到底。
    日本工会总评议会发言人南义雄发表谈话指出，美国把U—2型飞机撤出日本这是日本人民坚决斗争的结果。
    他强调指出，美帝国主义是不会自己抛弃战争政策和停止间谍活动的，因此“总评”将为粉碎新日美“安全条约”、撤销驻日美军基地而继续斗争。
    南义雄说，美国虽然从日本内地撤走U—2型飞机，但还存在着把它移到冲绳美军基地和其他地方继续进行间谍活动的危险性，因此日本人民必须严密监视，提高警惕，加强同冲绳人民的共同斗争，迫使美军从日本撤除它的基地。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本神奈川县一千五百多名妇女代表10日在设有美军基地的大和市举行大会。大会一致通过决议，坚决要求美国军队和美国U—2型飞机立即撤出日本。

  “安全条约”，要求撤销美军基地，反对成立岸信介式的内阁，要求立即解散国会。
    会后，与会者分成十队在岩国基地附近举行强有力的示威，高呼
  “撤销岩国的原子基地”，“U—2型喷气式飞机撤出日本”和“清除岸信介和佐藤”等口号。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：来自日本全国各地的一百一十六个“保卫三池煤矿工人协会”的二百零五名代表10日在大牟田市举行会议，总结了过去支援三池煤矿工人坚持罢工、反对解雇的经验，并且讨论了今后的运动方针。
    日本工会总评议会事务局次长蛯谷武弘在会上强调说，三池煤矿工人为反对解雇而展开的全面罢工，已经经历了一百六十六天。在这段期间里，工人和各界人民捐献了（不包括“总评”和煤矿工会的捐款）二千万日元支援英勇斗争的三池煤矿工人。他指出，三池煤矿工人的斗争关系着日本工人运动的前途，它对粉碎日本垄断资本为适应日美“安全条约体系”而进行的所谓“企业合理化”的阴谋，具有重要意义。
    自从今年春天三池煤矿工人展开罢工以来，日本各地纷纷成立支援三池矿工罢工组织。截至7月10日，已经成立了三百一十五个这种组织，还有一千多个组织正在筹组中。
    东京在9日成立了“文化界人士三池问题恳谈会”。参加恳谈会的有作家、评论家、大学教授等一百三十名各界著名人士。

    恳谈会还决定派遣五名代表前往大牟田市慰问斗争中的工人。（附图片）
