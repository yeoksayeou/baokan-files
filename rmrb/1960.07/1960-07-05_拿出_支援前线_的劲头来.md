Bring the spirit of "Supporting the Front Lines"
Lin Xu

"Go to the countryside! Support the agricultural front!"

Recently, people everywhere have been praising the moving deeds of industry supporting agriculture, cities supporting the countryside, and all walks of life trying their best to serve agricultural production. These deeds demonstrate the high revolutionary spirit of the working people.

In many areas, leading organs have moved their offices to the fields, Party committee secretaries have gone deep into the front lines of agricultural production, large numbers of cadres have gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, industrial and mining enterprises have sent machinery to people's commune production teams, workers have passed on technology to farmer brothers, People's Liberation Army soldiers are helping farmer brothers with rush harvesting, rush planting, and fighting drought and disaster relief, and literary and art workers have gone to the countryside to perform...

In many places in Liaoning Province, a high tide of industry supporting agriculture has been launched. People have put forward slogans such as: "Everyone should support agriculture, and everyone should do at least one good thing for agriculture."

In order to support agricultural technological transformation, all units of the People's Liberation Army, whether they are organs, factories, or schools, have taken the initiative to link up with local communes and formulate specific support plans. They proposed: What kind of machinery is needed for agricultural production, we will manufacture it; where there are technical difficulties, we will go there to support.

The Shandong Provincial Organs mobilized all manpower and material resources to support the current fight against drought and rush planting on the agricultural front. Except for the elderly and infirm and those who must stay in the organs to persist in their work, everyone participated in drought resistance for three days. The tools used by the various organs to fight drought included cars, handcarts, tricycles, and even bicycles and large iron kettles used by the organs to fetch water.

This is truly a great mobilization of all walks of life, with vehicles and people rushing to the agricultural front.

Seeing this vigorous battle scene of supporting agricultural production, one can't help but recall the unforgettable scenes of the masses supporting the front lines in the liberated areas during the war years. At that time, the battles on the front lines were closely linked to the fate of the people, and the needs of the front lines were the top priority. People regarded supporting the front lines as their sacred duty. Whoever could contribute to supporting the front lines, even if it was handing in a catty of public grain or making a pair of shoes, was a matter of great honor. No matter how difficult the conditions, no matter how dangerous the environment, the people's tenacious fighting will to support the front lines by risking their lives was always unwavering. The revolutionary spirit of rushing to support the front lines demonstrated the people's infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and a high sense of responsibility. The people in the rear regarded supporting the front lines and consolidating the rear as one issue; without a victorious front, there would be no consolidated rear. With such a strong backing, the soldiers on the front lines became stronger and stronger and were invincible. This common revolutionary belief encouraged people to proceed from the interests of the collective, serve the interests of the collective, and promote the spirit of selfless communism. It was precisely by relying on this common cooperation and unity that victory was achieved.

Isn't the revolutionary spirit of supporting agricultural production from all directions today an inheritance of this revolutionary spirit of "supporting the front lines"? How necessary and important it is to apply this spirit of "supporting the front lines" to supporting the agricultural front today! After China's socialist construction has entered a new stage of continuous leap forward, vigorously supporting agriculture, improving agricultural production, and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture have become even more urgent. This requires all walks of life, thousands of people, to extend a helping hand to the vast countryside together to quickly change the face of the countryside. All aspects of our country's work are a whole. People use a selfless spirit to do everything possible to support agricultural production, which is a manifestation of a high degree of collectivism. We must greatly promote this communist spirit, and take supporting the countryside and serving agricultural production as our sacred duty.

In fact, everyone supporting agriculture and supporting the countryside is not only accelerating the development of agricultural production, but the more profound significance lies in further strengthening the ties between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and enhancing people's deep feelings for farmer brothers. In the past, the revolutionary actions of the people "supporting the front lines" established a close and inseparable relationship between the army and the people; today, the mass activities of "supporting agriculture" by all walks of life will further strengthen the worker-peasant relationship, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and achieve rapid development of agricultural production as the foundation of the national economy.

### 拿出“支援前线”的劲头来

    拿出“支援前线”的劲头来
    林旭
    “到农村去！支援农业战线！”
    最近以来，人们到处传颂着工业支援农业，城市支援农村，各行各业千方百计为农业生产服务的动人事迹。这些事迹表现劳动人民高度的革命精神。
    许多地区的领导机关把办公室搬到田间去了，党委书记深入到农业生产第一线去了，大批干部到农村去参加农业生产了，工矿企业把机器送到人民公社生产队去了，工人们把技术传授给农民兄弟了，人民子弟兵在帮助农民弟兄抢收、抢种、抗旱救灾了，文艺工作者下乡演出去了……。
    辽宁省许多地方的厂矿企业掀起了工业支援农业的高潮，人们提出了这样的口号：“人人都来支援农业，每个人至少要为农业做一件好事”。
    人民解放军各部队为了支援农业技术改造，无论是机关、工厂、学校都主动与驻地公社挂钩，订出具体支援计划。他们提出：农业生产需要什么机械，就制造什么，那里遇到技术难关，就到那里支援。
    山东省级机关动员了一切人力、物力支援目前农业战线上的抗旱抢种斗争。除了年老体弱和必须留机关坚持工作的人以外，每人参加抗旱三天，各机关投入抗旱的工具有汽车、地排车、三轮车，甚至连自行车和机关提水用的大铁壶也运用起来了。
    这真是各行各业大动员，车水马龙，一齐奔向农业前线。
    看了这种轰轰烈烈支援农业生产的战斗场面，使人想起了解放区在战争时期人民群众支援前线的那些难忘的情景。那时候，前线上的战斗和人们的命运紧紧地连在一起，前线的需要就是第一需要，人们把支援前线当作自己神圣的职责，谁能够为支援前线尽一分力量，那怕是交一斤公粮、做一双鞋子，都是十分光荣的事情。无论是在多么困难的条件下，无论是在多么危险的环境中，人民群众出生入死支援前线的顽强斗争意志总是坚定不移的。那种争先恐后支援前线的革命精神，表现了人民对于革命事业的无限忠诚和高度的责任感。后方的人民把支援前线和巩固后方当作一个问题对待，没有胜利的前方，就没有巩固的后方。前方的战士有了这种强大的后盾，就愈战愈强，无往不胜。这种共同的革命信念鼓舞着人们一切从集体利益出发，为集体利益服务，发扬大公无私的共产主义精神，也正是靠着这种共同的协作和团结一致的力量，才取得胜利。
    现在四面八方支援农业生产的革命精神，不正是这种“支援前线”的革命精神的继承吗？把这种“支援前线”的精神，用到今天支援农业战线是多么需要，又是多么重要的事情啊！在我国社会主义建设进入连续跃进的新阶段以后，大力支援农业，提高农业生产，加速农业的技术改造，更加成为迫不及待的事情。这就需要各行各业、千千万万的人，向广阔的农村一起伸出支援的手，来迅速改变农村的面貌。我们国家的各项工作都是一个整体，人们用大公无私的精神，千方百计地支援农业生产，正是高度的集体主义精神的表现。我们正是要大大地发扬这种共产主义的精神，以支援农村、为农业生产服务，作为自己的崇高职责。
    其实，人人支援农业，支援农村，不仅是加速农业生产的发展，更深远的意义还在于进一步密切工农之间、城乡之间的联系，增强人们对于农民兄弟的深厚感情。过去，人民群众“支援前线”的革命行为，使得军民之间建立了亲密无间、血肉一体的关系；今天，各行各业“支援农业”的群众活动，会更加密切工农关系，加强工农联盟，达到迅速发展作为国民经济基础的农业生产。
