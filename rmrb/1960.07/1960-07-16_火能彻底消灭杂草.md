    Fire Can Completely Eliminate Weeds

    As everyone knows, weeds can greatly reduce the yield of crops such as grain, cotton, and sugar beets, and are very harmful to agriculture. Generally, weeding in the fields is done with cultivators. However, after cultivation, some weeds can still remain.

    The Soviet Union has recently invented a method of weeding with fire, and the advantage of this method is that it can completely eliminate weeds. Fire weeding can be done using the same cultivators. However, instead of soil-loosening blades, gas burners are installed. As the cultivator moves, the burners spray flames, burning weeds and pests between the rows. In order to prevent crops from being burned, special protective plates are installed on both sides of the burners.

    The cultivator with gas burners was invented by a research institute in Saratov. This cultivator is expected to be mass-produced by factories soon.

    火能彻底消灭杂草
    大家知道，杂草能大大降低粮食、棉花、甜菜等农作物的收成，对农业十分有害。一般田间除草都用中耕机来进行。但是中耕以后，部分杂草还是能留下来。
    苏联最近发明一种用火除草的方法，这种方法的好处是能彻底消灭杂草。用火除草时可利用同样的中耕机。不过不用松土的刀，而装上瓦斯烧嘴。中耕机走动的时候，烧嘴里就喷出火舌，将行间杂草以及害虫烧死。为了使农作物不被烧伤，烧嘴两边装有专门的防护板。
    带瓦斯烧嘴的中耕机是萨拉托夫的一个研究所发明的。这种中耕机预计不久即将由工厂大批生产。
