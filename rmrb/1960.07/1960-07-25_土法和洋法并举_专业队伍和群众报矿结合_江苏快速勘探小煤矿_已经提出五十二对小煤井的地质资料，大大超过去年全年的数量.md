(Xinhua Daily News) The geological exploration personnel on the coalfield exploration front in Jiangsu Province, while accelerating the exploration of large coal mines, are vigorously carrying out rapid surveys and exploration of small coal mines. Since the beginning of this year, they have already submitted geological data for fifty-two pairs of small coal pits, greatly exceeding the total amount submitted in the entire last year.

In order to accelerate the development of the coal industry, the Jiangsu Provincial Coal Bureau, at the beginning of this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, put forward the requirement of actively carrying out the survey and exploration of small coal mines to its subordinate exploration teams, and carried out education among the exploration personnel on the significance of vigorously developing small indigenous groups and small foreign groups of coal mines, and developing the coal industry at high speed, mobilizing everyone to discuss the new situation of national construction and the needs for coal in all aspects, so that everyone could understand the important significance of developing the coal industry at high speed. In the discussion, the workers cited concrete facts to illustrate that vigorously developing small coal pits is an important way to develop the coal industry at high speed, and criticized the ideas of a few comrades who emphasized the large and neglected the small. On this basis, the Provincial Coal Bureau also strengthened the leadership of the construction of small coal mines, specially established a small indigenous and foreign groups office; each coalfield exploration team was also led by the Party Committee Secretary, the captain, etc., to establish special institutions, dispatch drilling rigs and technical forces, and vigorously carry out the rapid survey and exploration of small coal mines.

In the survey and exploration of small coal mines, each coalfield exploration team, under the leadership of the local Party committees, closely combined the professional teams with the mass movement. They sent professional personnel to various counties, communes, and relevant departments to spread geological production knowledge, helped many counties and cities establish prospecting teams, and also organized mine reporting and prospecting groups in some communes, forming a mass prospecting and mine reporting network, thus rapidly creating a mass upsurge of mine reporting and prospecting, greatly accelerating the exploration progress. Since May, the results of exploration based on mass mine reporting, prospecting clues and data in eleven counties and cities have revealed more than one hundred coal-bearing mineral sites.

Each exploration team also insisted on implementing the principle of using both indigenous and foreign methods to accelerate the exploration progress. Many teams have adopted new technologies and new methods to carry out rapid comprehensive exploration, saving one-third to one-half of the workload, and submitted geological data reports in a relatively short period of time. For example, after the 169 Exploration Team adopted these methods, the exploration time for the same type of coalfield was shortened from the original twenty-nine months to four months.

    江苏快速勘探小煤矿
    已经提出五十二对小煤井的地质资料，大大超过去年全年的数量
    据新华日报消息　江苏省煤田勘探战线上的地质勘探人员，在加速勘探大型煤矿的同时，大搞小型煤矿的快速普查勘探。今年以来，已经提出了五十二对小型煤井的地质资料，大大超过了去年全年所提出的数量。
    为了加速煤炭工业的发展，江苏省煤炭局在今年一开始就根据省委指示，向所属各勘探队提出了积极进行小型煤矿的普查勘探的要求，并在勘探人员中进行了大搞小土群、小洋群煤矿，高速度发展煤炭工业的意义的教育，发动大家大论国家建设的新形势，大谈各方面对煤炭的需要，使大家明确高速度发展煤炭工业的重要意义。在讨论中，职工们举出具体事实说明大搞小型煤井是高速度发展煤炭工业的重要途径，批判了少数同志重大轻小的思想。在此基础上，省煤炭局又加强了小型煤矿建设工作的领导，专门建立了小土洋群办公室；各个煤田勘探队也分别由党委书记、队长等挂帅，建立专门机构，调派钻机和技术力量，大力开展小型煤矿的快速普查勘探工作。
    在小型煤矿的普查勘探工作中，各煤田勘探队在各地党委的领导下，做到专业队伍和群众运动密切结合。他们派出专业人员分赴各县、社和有关部门传播地质生产知识，帮助许多县、市建立了找矿队伍，在有些公社也组织了报矿、找矿小组，形成了群众性的找矿、报矿网，因而迅速出现了一个群众报矿、找矿的热潮，大大加快了勘探进度。5月份以来，在十一个县、市中根据群众报矿、找矿线索和资料进行勘探的结果，就发现了一百多处含煤矿点。
    各勘探队还坚持贯彻了土法和洋法并举的原则，加快了勘探进度。许多队采取新技术、新方法，进行快速综合勘探，节约了三分之一到二分之一的工作量，在较短的时间内就提出了地质资料的报告。如169勘探队在采取这些方法后，相同类型的煤田勘探时间，从原来二十九个月缩短到四个月。
