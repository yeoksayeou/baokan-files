　　Strengthening Field Management of Newly Reclaimed Land
　　Shaoyang Prefecture's Newly Built Reclamation Farms Launch Campaign to Turn Newly Reclaimed Land into Mature Cultivated Land

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the twenty-three state-owned agricultural and forestry reclamation farms newly built in Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan Province this year have launched a campaign to turn newly reclaimed land into mature cultivated land. Currently, each farm is concentrating over 80% of its labor force on large-scale field management. Various crops are growing vigorously, playing a good demonstration role in seizing the first bumper harvest on the 1.5 million mu of newly reclaimed wasteland in the entire region.

    Shaoyang Prefecture is located in a semi-hilly, semi-mountainous area. The region has relatively little cultivated land, with an average of just over one mu of paddy and dry land per person, but there is a vast amount of reclaimable wasteland. This spring, under the guidance of the principle of "simultaneously increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated area," the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized and organized more than 20,000 laborers from densely populated hilly areas to establish twenty-three state-owned agricultural and forestry reclamation farms in mountainous areas. From the beginning of the reclamation battle, each farm conscientiously implemented the spirit of "reclaiming and planting simultaneously," achieving the goal of planting one mu for every mu reclaimed. By early June, a total of 452,900 mu of wasteland had been reclaimed, exceeding the annual reclamation plan by 30%. All newly reclaimed land was planted with grain, oil crops, vegetables, fodder, and cash crops, and intercropping was practiced on more than 160,000 mu.

    Based on the characteristics of severe bird and animal damage in mountainous areas, each farm strengthened field management in a timely manner after sowing. They adopted the "hen laying eggs" method, leaving one or two laborers to manage every 50 to 100 mu of land sown. These one or two people focused on guarding seeds and preventing bird and animal damage, while also weeding and accumulating fertilizer, allowing the sown seeds to safely pass the seedling emergence stage. After the seeds germinated and emerged, each farm adopted a combination of professional team management and large-scale concentrated efforts to vigorously grasp tasks such as replanting to ensure full stands, inter-row cultivation, fertilization, pest control, and eliminating third-class seedlings. Led by the Party Committee Secretary, the Tuqiao Farm in Chengbu Miao Autonomous County, mobilized over 1,000 workers to camp on the mountain and work hard on inter-row cultivation and topdressing. By the end of June, they had completed the second inter-row cultivation and topdressing on all 25,000 mu of various crops, which are currently growing very well.

    While vigorously grasping grain production, each farm also achieved significant results in diversified operations, with pig raising as the main focus. Currently, the twenty-three reclamation farms have raised over 12,000 pigs. The cash income from digging medicinal herbs and other sources has reached over 720,000 yuan, averaging more than 30 yuan per laborer.

　　加强新垦地的田间管理
　　邵阳专区新建垦殖场开展新垦地赶熟耕地运动
    据新华社讯　湖南邵阳专区今年新建的二十三个国营农林垦殖场开展了一个新垦地赶熟耕地的运动。目前，各场正集中80％以上的劳动力大搞田间管理，各种作物长得欣欣向荣，为夺取全区一百五十万亩新垦荒地的第一个丰收，起了良好的示范作用。
    邵阳专区地处半丘陵、半山区。全区耕地较少，平均每人仅有水田和旱地一亩多，但可垦荒地很广阔。今年春季，中共邵阳地委在“提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积并举”的方针指导下，从人口稠密的丘陵地区，动员组织了二万多个劳动力，在山区建立了二十三个国营农林垦殖场。垦荒战斗一开始，各场就认真地贯彻了“边开边种”的精神，做到开一亩，种一亩。到6月上旬，共开荒四十五万二千九百多亩，超额30％完成了全年开荒计划，全部新开荒地都种上了粮食、油料、蔬菜、饲料和经济作物，有十六万多亩还实行了间种。
    各场根据山区鸟兽害严重的特点，播种以后及时地加强了田间管理。他们采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，每播种五十至一百亩地，便留下一、两个劳动力进行管理。这一、两个人以看守种子、防治鸟兽害为主，结合进行除草、积肥，使播下的种子安全地度过出苗关。种子发芽出土后，各场又采取专业队管理和大兵团突击相结合的办法，猛抓补兜全苗、中耕、施肥、除虫和消灭三类苗等项工作。城步苗族自治县土桥农场在场党委书记的率领下，全场一千多名职工上山扎营，大干中耕追肥，到6月底已全部完成了第二次中耕追肥，当前全场二万五千多亩各种农作物生长很好。
    各场在大抓粮食生产的同时，以发展养猪为主的多种经营也获得了显著成绩。目前二十三个垦殖场饲养的生猪已达一万二千多头；从挖药材等方面收入的现金共达七十二万余元，达到每个劳动力平均有三十多元。
