Strengthen the Idea of the Whole Country as a Single Chessboard; Closely Coordinate Coal Transportation Departments
Hebei and Henan Vigorously Transfer Coal to Ensure Steel Production

(Our Tianjin dispatch, July 7th) Hebei Province, in the spirit of the whole country as a single chessboard, is actively increasing coal production to support major key enterprises nationwide. In the second quarter, the province exceeded the state coal transfer plan by 2.3%, with the quality meeting national standards.

Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province attach great importance to coal transfer work. In addition to educating cadres on the idea of the "national chessboard" of "prioritizing the outside before the inside" at various meetings, they have also strengthened the leadership of scheduling work, conducting daily inspections, promptly understanding the situation, and taking measures. First, a province-wide coal overproduction competition to ensure steel production was continuously carried out. Major coking coal mines universally promoted advanced coal mining methods such as water mining and water transportation, three-zero work surfaces, and shelter supports, which greatly increased the production of coking coal. For example, the Jingxing Coal Mine, which produces coking coal, completed half of its annual production plan ahead of schedule by June 24th, supporting the production of many key enterprises nationwide.

In order to supply high-quality coal, major washing and selection plants throughout the province actively improved equipment, strengthened manual selection and flotation, and improved the quality of refined coal. At the same time, in order to quickly load and transport more coal to meet the needs of a substantial increase in production of key enterprises, major coal mines are actively adding loading and unloading tools and coal storage silos. At present, fifty landslide funnel coal silos and mechanized coal storage plants have been built throughout the province, greatly speeding up the loading speed and ensuring the coal supply to key enterprises.

(Our Zhengzhou dispatch, July 7th) In the coal grabbing battle of "taking steel as the key link and ensuring steel production with coal," coal enterprises and transportation departments in Henan Province resolutely implemented the policy of "prioritizing the outside before the inside and prioritizing key points before general ones," achieving a "double harvest of high production and transportation," ensuring the rapid and timely transfer of coal to other provinces.

Since the beginning of this year, under the guidance of the idea of the "whole country as a single chessboard," the provincial coal and railway transportation leadership departments have further strengthened cooperation, carried out mutual competitions, and promoted increased production with each other. As of the end of June, coal transported by railway increased by 90% compared with the same period last year, and the daily loading level increased by nearly double from June last year. Among them, the amount of coal allocated to other provinces is equivalent to the total amount transferred out last year; the coal supplied to iron and steel metallurgical enterprises in the second quarter is equal to three times that of the same period last year. In addition, they also took the initiative to promptly meet the coal needs of key factories and mines such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, Nanjing Yongli Ning Factory, and Liaoning Petroleum Third Factory.

With the rapid increase in coal transportation and loading volume, the Henan coal and transportation departments actively carried out basic construction. In the past six months, 109 kilometers of native and foreign railways and more than 40 coal storage silos have been built or are about to be completed in mining areas. After these newly built railways and coal storage silos are all completed, the direct loading capacity can be increased by another 50%. At the same time, in the mass movement of technological revolution and technological innovation, the workers and staff of various mines put forward the slogan of realizing "self-flowing loading, rail transportation in mining areas, and a dragon-like network of production, supply, transportation and sales." The Jiaozuo Wangfeng Mine built three landslide-style coal silos in one month, and the total capacity of the coal storage silos has reached more than four days, completely realizing the new situation of "normal production even if trains don't come for three days, and normal loading even if there is no production for three days."

    加强全国一盘棋思想　密切煤运部门的协作
    河北河南大力调煤保钢
    本报天津7日电　河北省本着全国一盘棋的精神，积极增产更多的煤炭，支援全国各大重点企业。第二季全省已超额2.3％完成了国家煤炭调运计划，质量合乎国家规定标准。
    河北省各级党委很重视煤炭调运工作。除了在各种会议上对干部进行“先外后内”的全国一盘棋思想教育外，还加强了调度工作的领导，逐日进行检查，及时了解情况，采取措施。首先是在全省范围内连续开展了以煤保钢的煤炭大超产竞赛。各大炼焦煤矿普遍推行了水采水运、三无工作面，掩护支架等先进采煤方法，大大提高了炼焦煤的生产。如产炼焦煤的井陉煤矿到6月24日提前六天超额完成了全年生产计划的一半，支援了全国许多重点企业的生产。
    为供应好精煤，全省各大洗选厂积极改进设备，加强手选和浮选，提高了精煤质量。同时，为了快装多运，保证各重点企业的大幅度增产的需要，各大煤矿都在积极增设装卸工具，储煤仓等。现在全省已经建成了五十座滑坡漏斗煤仓和机械化储煤厂，装车速度大大加快，保证了对重点企业的煤炭供应。
    本报郑州7日电　河南省煤炭企业和运输部门在“以钢为纲，以煤保钢”的夺煤大战中，坚决贯彻了“先外后内，先重点后一般”的方针，实现了“高产、运输双丰收”，保证了外调煤炭迅速及时的调运。
    今年以来，全省煤炭、铁路运输领导部门，在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，进一步加强协作，相互开展竞赛，彼此促进增产。截至6月底，经由铁路运输的煤炭，较去年同期增长90％，日装车水平由去年6月份提高近一倍。其中拨给外省煤的运量，相当于去年全年的调出量；第二季度供应给钢铁冶金企业的用煤等于去年同期的三倍。此外，他们还主动及时地满足了武钢、武汉重型机床厂、南京永利宁厂、辽宁石油三厂等重点厂矿的用煤。
    随着煤炭运输和装车量的猛烈增长，河南煤炭和运输部门积极地进行了基本建设。半年来建成和即将建成的矿区土洋铁路一百零九公里，各类煤仓四十余座。这些新建铁路和煤仓全部建成后，直接装车能力就可以再提高50％。同时，各矿职工在大搞技术革命和技术革新运动中，提出了实现“装车自流化、矿区运输轨道化、产供运销龙网化”的口号。焦作王封矿一个月修建了滑坡式煤仓三座，装车煤仓总容量已达四天以上，完全实现了“三天不来车照常生产，三天不生产照常装车”的新局面。
