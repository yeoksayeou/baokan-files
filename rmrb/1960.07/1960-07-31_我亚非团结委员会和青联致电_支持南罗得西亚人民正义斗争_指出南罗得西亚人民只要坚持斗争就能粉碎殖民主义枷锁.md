    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia and forwarded it to the people of Southern Rhodesia, extending, on behalf of the Chinese people, fraternal greetings and resolute support to the people of Southern Rhodesia who are heroically struggling against British colonial rule and for political rights and independence and freedom.
    The telegram said: For more than seventy years, British colonialists have carried out extremely cruel plunder and oppression against the people of Southern Rhodesia. Since World War II, the forces of U.S. imperialism have also increasingly and massively invaded Southern Rhodesia to carry out exploitation and plunder. Imperialism also implements an extremely barbaric policy of racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia. Recently, British colonialists have continuously carried out bloody suppression of the people of Southern Rhodesia. The Chinese people express boundless anger and strong protest against the criminal acts of the British colonialists. We believe that the British colonialists must immediately stop the bloody suppression, must end the colonial rule of Southern Rhodesia, and the imperialist aggressive forces must completely withdraw from Southern Rhodesia.
    The people of Southern Rhodesia have carried out a long-term struggle against colonialism, imperialism, and racial discrimination. Their struggle is not isolated. At present, the African national independence movement is in full swing, advancing victoriously. Imperialism and colonialism have fallen into unprecedented isolation and are retreating steadily. The storm of the struggle against imperialism is sweeping the world. The international situation is very favorable to the struggle of Southern Rhodesia and the African people. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia to win national independence and oppose imperialism and colonialism, and will always stand with the people of Southern Rhodesia. We firmly believe that as long as the people of Southern Rhodesia unite closely and persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to smash the shackles of colonialism, eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism, and win the final victory of independence and freedom.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. The All-China Youth Federation today wrote a letter to the African Organization Committee and forwarded it to the youth of Southern Rhodesia, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia against the cruel rule of the British colonial authorities and for national independence, and expressing serious condemnation of the British colonial authorities' atrocities of arresting leaders of the National Democratic Party and dispatching military police to carry out bloody suppression.
    The letter said that the heroic struggles launched by the people and youth of Southern Rhodesia in Bulawayo and Salisbury against the British colonial military police fully demonstrate the fearless spirit of the African people in opposing imperialism and colonialism. The British colonial authorities' frenzied suppression of the people of Southern Rhodesia and any conspiracies cannot stop the heroic people of Southern Rhodesia from moving towards independence and freedom. We firmly believe that as long as the people and youth of Southern Rhodesia unite closely and resolutely fight imperialism to the end, they will surely be able to completely get rid of the shackles of colonialism and achieve national liberation.

    我亚非团结委员会和青联致电
    支持南罗得西亚人民正义斗争
    指出南罗得西亚人民只要坚持斗争就能粉碎殖民主义枷锁
    新华社29日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天致电南罗得西亚民族民主党并转南罗得西亚人民，代表中国人民向正在为反对英国殖民统治、要求政治权利和独立自由而英勇斗争的南罗得西亚人民，致以兄弟的敬意和表示坚决的支持。
    电文说：七十多年来，英国殖民主义者对南罗得西亚人民进行了极端残酷的掠夺和压迫。美帝国主义势力在第二次大战后，也日益大量侵入南罗得西亚，进行剥削和掠夺。帝国主义还在南罗得西亚实行极其野蛮的种族歧视政策。最近，英国殖民者竟对南罗得西亚人民不断进行血腥镇压。中国人民对英国殖民者的罪恶行为表示无比愤怒和强烈的抗议。我们认为，英国殖民者必须立即停止血腥镇压，必须结束对南罗得西亚的殖民统治，帝国主义侵略势力必须全部撤出南罗得西亚。
    南罗得西亚人民进行了长期的反对殖民主义、帝国主义和种族歧视的斗争。他们的斗争不是孤立的。目前，非洲民族独立运动正如火如荼，乘胜前进，帝国主义和殖民主义已陷入空前孤立和节节败退的境地，反对帝国主义的斗争风暴正席卷全世界。国际形势十分有利于南罗得西亚和非洲人民的斗争。中国人民一贯同情和坚决支持南罗得西亚人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义、殖民主义的正义斗争，并将永远与南罗得西亚人民站在一起。我们深信，只要南罗得西亚人民紧密地团结起来，坚持斗争，就一定能粉碎殖民主义的枷锁，一定能消除帝国主义的侵略势力，赢得独立和自由的最后胜利。
    新华社30日讯　中华全国青年联合会今天写信给非洲组织委员会转南罗得西亚青年，坚决支持南罗得西亚人民反抗英国殖民当局的残酷统治、争取民族独立的正义斗争，并且对英国殖民当局逮捕民族民主党领袖、出动军警进行血腥镇压的暴行，表示严正的谴责。
    信中说，南罗得西亚人民和青年在布拉瓦约和索耳兹伯里跟英国殖民军警展开的英勇斗争，充分显示了非洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义的大无畏精神。英国殖民当局对南罗得西亚人民的疯狂镇压和任何阴谋活动，决不能阻挡英勇的南罗得西亚人民走向独立和自由。我们深信，南罗得西亚人民和青年只要紧密地团结起来，坚决跟帝国主义斗争到底，一定能够彻底摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，实现民族解放。
