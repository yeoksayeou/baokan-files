Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 19th: Under the slogan of "Seize the rain, seize the time, plant more, harvest more grain," Sichuan is seizing the great opportunity after the rain and has launched a new high tide of rush planting and cultivation, achieving remarkable results. To date, with the exception of single-season late rice, the planting plans for other major spring crops in the province have been overfulfilled or basically completed.

Since mid-July, most parts of the province have experienced welcome rainfall, generally between 30 and 50 millimeters, and even as high as 70 millimeters in some areas. As soon as the rainfall began, Party organizations at all levels immediately led the masses into the battle to seize the water and plant crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 18th: After completing the task of planting spring crops, Sichuan has once again launched a mass upsurge of planting wherever possible, striving to plant more and harvest more.

Recently, more than ten prefectures in the province with faster planting progress and earlier completion, while strengthening autumn field management, have seized the agricultural gaps and carried out short-term, intensive planting. In the past few days, the Fuling Prefecture has mobilized 4 million people to eliminate idle land. The increased planting area of sweet potatoes and corn alone has reached more than 147,000 mu. Many areas are seizing the current peak growing season for vegetables and are universally launching a campaign for every person to grow 100 jin of vegetables.

Sichuan Province, with a relatively dense population, in order to ensure increased agricultural production, makes full use of all scattered land and vigorously promotes increased planting every season. This year, it has successively launched several mass planting campaigns, each of which has achieved great success. During the spring planting season this year, Wusheng County launched five mass planting campaigns, increasing the planting of various coarse grains and bean seeds by more than 3.6 million jin, and planting an average of more than 250 pumpkin seedlings per household. Recently, after overfulfilling the spring planting task, the county seized the good opportunity after the rain and launched the sixth mass planting campaign, planting more than 50 million sweet potato seedlings in one go, an average of more than 100 seedlings per person. Yibin Prefecture, which has already achieved great success in increasing planting, after basically planting all available land around fields, houses, and other convenient areas, further launched a mass movement to investigate empty fields and land in high mountain areas and border areas between counties and communes, and vigorously increase planting. Recently, Gong County mobilized more than 50,000 people to increase planting of various high-yield crops in empty land in high mountain areas and border areas, adding more than 20,000 mu. In order to grasp increased planting as seriously as regular planting, many places have established leadership organizations for increased planting led by the secretaries, made special arrangements for the labor, fertilizer, and seeds required for increased planting, and conscientiously arranged the field management work for increased planting, so as to ensure increased planting and increased income.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: Guangxi's rural people's communes have mobilized more than 1 million people to seize the good opportunity after the rain to rush plant and expand the planting of coarse grain crops and rice. As of the 10th, the autonomous region had rushed to plant 5.6 million mu of crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, soybeans, and other minor grains, an increase of nearly 1 million mu compared to the end of June.

Since the beginning of spring, rainfall in various parts of Guangxi has been low. From July 8th to 13th, most parts of the region experienced moderate to heavy rainfall. In the Baise and Liuzhou prefectures, where the drought situation was serious, most counties, except for a few with still little rainfall, already had water to plow the fields and rush plant dryland crops. After the rain, all localities made emergency deployments to fully rush plant and expand planting. In Huanjiang County, Liuzhou Prefecture, after receiving rain on the 8th, the area of various coarse grain crops plowed and planted on the 9th alone increased by more than two times the highest daily progress before the 9th. In He County, Fuzhong, Mengshan, and Zhaoping counties in Wuzhou Prefecture, after the rain, in addition to retaining a small number of laborers to care for late rice seedlings and prepare summer harvesting and planting tools, most of the labor force rushed to expand the planting of coarse grain crops; Cenxi, Cangwu, and Teng counties, where the summer harvest entered a busy period, also arranged a certain amount of labor to rush plant coarse grain crops. In Baise Prefecture, after the rain on the 8th, 400,000 people raced against time to rush plow, rush harrow, and rush plant every day. The Bama Yao Autonomous County launched a high tide of planting hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of mu per day, and the daily progress of rush planting was ten times faster than before the rain. As of the 13th, in just five days, the entire prefecture had planted 50,000 mu of late rice, sown 2 million jin of late rice seedlings, and cultivated 80,000 mu of middle rice, and had also newly planted more than 600,000 mu of coarse grain crops such as red glutinous rice, corn, sorghum, and soybeans.

In the rush planting and expansion of planting, Party committee secretaries at all levels and all cadres went to the forefront of production to participate in production and direct production. In Luocheng, Yishan, Da Miao Shan and other sixteen counties in Liuzhou Prefecture, there were a total of 414 commune Party committee secretaries and more than 28,600 cadres from county and commune directly affiliated organs who went deep into the forefront of production. Yuan Bangdian, the First Secretary of the Xincheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to the Gupeng Commune to hold a forum for old farmers, summarized and promoted the experience of three crops a year and multiple harvests in one field, and the county quickly launched a high tide of intercropping and crop rotation. As of July 12th, the county had planted 116,000 mu of various coarse grain crops, either singly or intercropped and rotated, an expansion of nearly five times compared to the 20,000 mu lost to drought.

While expanding and rushing planting, all localities are also actively carrying out water storage and conservation in preparation for the next crop. Counties in Guilin Prefecture have adopted six methods for storing and conserving water, such as digging ditches to divert water and expanding the rainwater catchment area of mountain ponds and reservoirs. At present, more than 1.26 million mu of medium rice in the entire prefecture have universally stored more than two inches of water; according to statistics from Quanzhou, Xing'an, Yongfu, and other nine counties, there are also 47 water storage projects that have stored more than 1 million cubic meters of water respectively.

　　四川广西抓紧雨后扩种杂粮水稻
    据新华社成都19日电　四川各地在“抢雨水、抢时间、多栽种、多打粮”的口号下，抓住雨后大好时机，掀起了突击抢栽抢种的新高潮，取得了显著成绩。到目前为止，全省除一季晚稻外，其他主要大春作物的栽种计划，均已超额完成或基本完成。
    进入7月中旬以来，全省各地普降喜雨，一般降雨量都在三十至五十毫米，有的地区甚至高达七十多毫米。降雨一开始，各级党组织立即率领群众投入抢水栽种战斗。
    据新华社成都18日电　四川各地在结束了大春作物栽种任务以后，又再次掀起了见缝插针、有土必种的全民增种高潮，力争多种多收。
    近日来，全省十多个正种工作进度较快、结束较早的专区，在加强秋田管理的同时，抓紧农隙，短期突击增种。涪陵专区最近几天连续出动四百万人，突击消灭空闲土地，仅甘薯、玉米两项作物的增种面积就有十四万七千多亩。许多地区抓紧当前蔬菜生长旺季，普遍开展每人百斤菜运动。
    人口比较稠密的四川省，为保证农业增产，充分利用一切零星土地，每一个季节都狠抓增种。今年已先后开展了多次全民增种运动，每次都取得很大成绩。武胜县在今年大春栽种期中，就先后开展了五次全民增种运动，增种各种杂粮和豆类的种子达三百六十多万斤、南瓜平均每户二百五十多窝。最近，这个县在超额完成了大春栽种任务以后，又抓紧雨后良机，开展了第六次全民增种运动，一鼓作气增种了甘薯五千多万窝，每人平均超过了百窝。增种工作已经取得很大成绩的宜宾专区在田边地角、屋前屋后等近便空地基本种满种尽之后，进一步在高山区和县与县、社与社交界的边缘地区，开展查空田空地、大搞增种的群众运动。珙县最近出动五万多人，在高山区和交界区的空间土地上增种了各种高产作物“王”二万多亩。许多地方为了把增种像正种一样地抓起来，都由书记挂帅，建立了增种的领导机构，对增种所需要的劳力、肥料、种子作了专门安排，并认真安排增种的田间管理工作，以保证增种增收。
    据新华社南宁电　广西农村人民公社出动一百多万人，抓紧雨后良机，抢种、扩种杂粮作物和水稻。到10日止，全自治区抢种的红薯、玉米、黄豆和小杂粮等作物已达五百六十万亩，比6月底增加了将近一百万亩。
    今春以来，广西各地雨量偏少。7月8日至13日，全区各地普降中雨到大雨，旱情严重的百色和柳州专区，除个别县降雨仍少外，一般县已经有水耙田和抢种旱地作物。雨后，各地都作了紧急部署，全力突击抢种、扩种。柳州专区环江县8日得雨，9日一天边犁边种的各种杂粮作物面积，比9日前最高日进度增加两倍多。梧州专区的贺县、富钟、蒙山、昭平四县，下雨以后，除留少数劳力护理晚稻秧苗和准备夏收夏种工具外，大部分劳动力突击扩种杂粮作物；夏收进入大忙的岑溪、苍梧、藤县三县，也安排一定的劳力抢种杂粮作物。百色专区8日雨后，每天有四十万人分秒必争地抢犁、抢耙和抢种。巴马瑶族自治县掀起日插百、千、万亩运动高潮，抢插日进度比雨前加快十倍。全专区到13日止，仅五天时间，除插下晚稻五万亩、播晚稻秧二百万斤、中稻耘田八万亩外，还新种下红茹、玉米、高粱、黄豆等杂粮作物六十多万亩。
    在争分夺秒的抢种、扩种中，各级党委书记和全体干部，都到生产第一线，参加生产，指挥生产。柳州专区罗城、宜山、大苗山等十六个县，深入生产第一线的公社党委书记共有四百一十四人，县、社直属机关干部二万八千六百多人。中共忻城县委第一书记袁邦殿，深入到古蓬公社召开老农座谈会，总结与推广了一年三熟、一地多收的经验后，全县很快就掀起了间种、套种高潮。到7月12日止，全县已单种和间种、套种各种杂粮作物十一万六千多亩，比受旱损失的二万多亩扩大近五倍。
    各地在进行扩种、抢种的同时，还积极进行蓄水保水，以备下造使用。桂林专区各县采取开沟引水，扩大山塘水库积雨面积等六项办法储水保水，目前，全专区一百二十六万多亩中稻，普遍储水二寸以上；另据全州、兴安、永福等九个县统计，还有四十七处蓄水工程已分别储水一百万立方米以上。（附图片）
