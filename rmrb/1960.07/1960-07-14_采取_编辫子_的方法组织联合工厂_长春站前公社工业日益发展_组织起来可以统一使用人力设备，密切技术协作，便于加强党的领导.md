　　Adopting the "Braiding" Method to Organize Joint Factories
　　Changchun Railway Station Public Commune's Industry is Growing Daily
　　Organization Enables Unified Use of Manpower and Equipment, Close Technological Collaboration, and Facilitates Strengthening of Party Leadership
    (Our dispatch) Changchun Railway Station People's Commune in Jilin Province, adopting the "braiding" method to organize jointly-run factories from commune (street) enterprises, has strongly promoted the great development of commune-run industry and the consolidation and improvement of the commune.

    The industry of the Changchun Railway Station Public Commune has developed greatly. Commune-run factories have increased from sixteen to eighteen, and street-run factories have increased from five to forty. The number of employees has increased from seven hundred and eighty-seven to two thousand and seventy-one. This year, the total industrial output value will increase fifteen times compared to 1959. Due to the rapid development of commune-run industry, some new problems have also emerged. The main ones are that commune-run factories are widely distributed, making unified leadership inconvenient; management is lagging behind, and some factories' production lacks direction; the allocation of equipment is also unreasonable, with a shortage of equipment affecting production and surplus equipment not being used; and there is also competition for labor and raw materials. Under these circumstances, the Party Committee of the Changchun Railway Station Public Commune, based on the instructions of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, began in early May to form "braids" based on production nature and cooperative relationships, with the old commune factories as the core. The fifty-eight factories of the entire commune were organized into seven joint factories, including machinery, electrical machinery, chemical, textile, wood products, clothing, and paper and stationery, and a basic construction and transportation company was established. These joint factories are all under the direct leadership of the commune, and the production plans, personnel allocation, financial supply and sales, and other work within the factories are unified, which strengthens production management and plays a significant role in the development, consolidation, and improvement of commune industry.

    The establishment of joint factories enables small street-run factories to be directly under the unified leadership of the commune, changing the past situation of scattered management, large scale, multiple leadership, and inconvenient management. This powerfully ensures the implementation of the Party's various guidelines and policies, and gradually incorporates production into the national plan. Since the establishment of the joint factories, the policy of serving large-scale industry, agriculture, basic construction, people's economic life, and exports has been better implemented. Currently, the entire commune has fifteen types of products directly assigned by the province and city. In order to better serve state-owned industry, the chemical joint factory produces a large amount of potassium hydroxide for the gas company's needs. The machinery, wood products, and other joint factories have vigorously developed the production of small commodities according to market needs. In the past month alone, more than ten new varieties, such as coat clasps and cloth shoes, have been produced. After many factories were incorporated into a joint factory, they unified and adjusted the use of manpower and equipment, transforming the original cooperation between factories into internal division of labor and cooperation, completing "missing leg" equipment, and solving key production problems. In the past, both the small hardware factory and the nail-making factory lacked pressure. Now that the machinery factory has merged into the machinery joint factory, the pressure is adjusted and used during the machinery factory's spare production time, solving the problem of pressure shortage. At the same time, the machinery factory also assigned a fitter to specialize in making molds for various small commodities for the hardware factory, so that many small commodities were quickly put into production. In the past, the commune's hardware factory and the wire drawing factory both had some small bench drill parts, but they were incomplete and could not be assembled. After the establishment of the joint factory, the parts were concentrated and assembled into a small bench drill.

    After the establishment of the joint factories, technological cooperation between factories became closer, which powerfully promoted the development of the technical revolution movement. The old commune factory—Hongqi Chemical Factory—sent thirty-five veteran workers to help the various branch factories carry out technical revolution on a large scale, which has achieved remarkable results. With assistance, Chemical Factory No. 1 adopted new technology to boil potassium nitrate, shortening the time from three hours to seven minutes and greatly reducing labor intensity. Comprehensive factories have also created favorable conditions for the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and the development of diversified operations.

    In establishing joint factories, the Party Committee of the Changchun Railway Station Public Commune vigorously strengthened the Party's leadership over commune-run industry. The commune Party Committee selected a group of relatively strong cadres to serve as Party branch secretaries of the joint factories, while vigorously grasping the political and ideological work of employees, so that the majority of employees further clarified the service direction of commune-run industry. The Party Committee also selected a group of activists with high political awareness and certain work ability from among the workers to serve in grassroots leadership positions.

　　采取“编辫子”的方法组织联合工厂
　　长春站前公社工业日益发展
　　组织起来可以统一使用人力设备，密切技术协作，便于加强党的领导
    本报讯　吉林省长春市站前人民公社，采取“编辫子”方法，分别将社（街道）办工业组成联合工厂，有力地促进了社办工业大发展和公社的巩固提高。
    站前公社工业有了很大发展。社办工厂由过去十六个增加到十八个，街道办工厂由五个增加到四十个，职工从七百八十七名，增加到二千零七十一名，今年工业总产值比1959年将增加十五倍。由于社办工业发展很快，也出现一些新问题。主要是社办工厂分布广，不便统一领导；经营管理跟不上，有的工厂生产有盲目性；设备配置也有不合理现象，缺设备的影响生产，设备有余的用不了；并且有互争劳力、原料现象。在这种情况下，站前公社党委根据省委、市委指示，从5月上旬开始，以公社老厂为核心，按照生产性质和协作关系编成“一条辫子”，将全公社五十八个工厂分别组成机械、电机、化工、纺织、木器、被服、纸张文具等七个联合工厂，并成立一个基本建设交通公司。这些联合工厂均在公社直接领导下，并将厂内生产计划、人员配备、财务供销等工作统一起来，加强了生产管理，对发展和巩固提高公社工业起了重大作用。
    联合工厂的建立，使街道办的小工厂直接在公社统一领导下，改变了过去经营分散、面大、头多、不便管理的状况，有力地保证了党的各项方针政策的贯彻，并且逐步将生产纳入国家计划。自联合工厂成立以来，更好地贯彻了为大工业、为农业、为基本建设、为人民经济生活、为出口服务的方针。现在全公社由省、市直接下达的产品品种有十五种。化工联合厂为了更好地为国营工业服务，生产了大量的氢氧化钾，供应煤气公司需用。机械、木器等联合厂，根据市场需要，大力发展了小商品生产。近一个月来，已经生产了大衣卡子、布鞋等十多种新品种。许多工厂纳入一个联合厂以后，统一调剂使用了人力、设备，使原来厂与厂之间的协作，变成内部分工配合，把“缺腿”的设备配成了套，解决了生产上的关键问题。小五金厂和制钉厂过去都缺压力，现在机械厂一同并到机械联合厂以后，用机械厂生产空隙时间，调剂使用压力，解决了缺压力的困难。同时机械厂还抽出一名钳工专门给五金厂制做各种小商品的模具，使许多小商品迅速投入生产。过去公社五金厂和引拔厂都有一部分小台钻零件，但都不全，配不上套，成立联合厂以后，将零件集中起来，装配成一台小台钻。
    联合工厂成立以后，使各厂的技术协作更加密切了，有力地推动了技术革命运动的发展。公社老厂——红旗化工厂抽出三十五名老工人帮助各分厂大搞技术革命，收到了显著效果。化工一厂经过帮助，采用新技术熬硝酸钾，时间由过去三小时缩短为七分钟，并大大减轻了劳动强度。综合工厂也为原材料综合利用和开展多品种经营创造了有利条件。
    站前公社党委在建立联合工厂中，大力加强了党对社办工业的领导。公社党委抽出一批较强的干部担任联合工厂的党支部书记，同时大抓职工政治思想工作，使广大职工进一步明确社办工业的服务方向。党委还从工人中挑选了一批政治觉悟高，具有一定工作能力的积极分子，担任基层领导工作。
