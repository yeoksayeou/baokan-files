    Introducing the Leadership Methods of Three Production Teams
    Zhang Hua, Yang Kunquan, Li Guang
    Editor's Note: This is an article published on July 3rd in the *Hubei Daily*. When publishing this article, the newspaper also published an article by Comrade Gong Tongwen titled "Take a Firm Grip to the Very End." The *Hubei Daily* added an editor's note when publishing this article, stating: "The People's Commune is the organizer of production and life, and the production team is the most direct and specific organizer of production and life. The quality of the team's work has a great impact on production and life. How can the work of the team be done well? According to the experience introduced in this article, there are mainly two aspects: one is the issue of people, and the other is the issue of systems. The so-called issue of people is that, under the leadership of the production team's Party branch, there must be a good team leader, a sound team committee, a group of activists united around the team committee, and these activists must then unite the masses of commune members. The so-called issue of systems is that there must be a set of practical and feasible rules and regulations suitable for collective production and collective life in all aspects of production and life, and these rules must be conscientiously implemented. After the people's communes were established, the work of the production teams has been greatly improved through several reorganizations, but there are still many problems, such as the leadership methods of the teams and the management and operation issues, which urgently need to be studied and resolved. The work of the team is not only very important but also very complex, and it is not simple to do it well. This requires Party committees at all levels to pay more attention to the work of the team, summarize the work experience of the team, and strengthen leadership and assistance to the team. It would be wrong to think that the work of the team is not a big deal, that doing it well or badly does not affect the overall situation, or that it can be done well without much effort, and therefore not go deep into the team or seriously study the work problems of the team." We believe that the experience introduced in this article is very good, and we are reprinting the entire article for the study and research of rural work comrades in various regions. The editor's notes in the text were all added by the *Hubei Daily*."
    Recently, we spent a month or so in various communes in Zaoyang County, focusing on understanding the leadership methods and management issues of production teams. The work of most teams in this county is done relatively well, and from what we have learned, the work of the Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team (Fourth Team) of the Jinxing First Production Team in Lutou Commune, the Sanlimiao Team of the Zhongsu Production Team in Huancheng Commune, and the Tanjiawan Team of the Guoguang Production Team is particularly outstanding. These three teams have cadres with a deep, meticulous, and solid work style, and the masses are highly enthusiastic. They all have a relatively good set of leadership methods and management systems in production and life, and they are all achieving great results. The general impression they give is: the work is tense but orderly, the enthusiasm is full but there is also work and rest, and everyone is of one mind and full of vitality. The work of these teams also has its own characteristics, which are introduced separately below:

    I. Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team
    The characteristics of this team are: it has a strong team committee and a capable team leader, a sound system of collective leadership and division of responsibilities; it does a good job of labor management, and has a strict organization and rules in production work; it has the "Five Tiger Generals" who are famous throughout the county; the cadres care about people, are considerate, and are good at political and ideological work.

    Collective Leadership and Division of Responsibilities
    In addition to the team leader, the members of the team committee also include deputy team leaders and work group leaders responsible for sideline occupations, life, technology, and women's work. They are all democratically elected by the masses. They all have a relatively high level of political and ideological awareness, are active and willing to work, are fair in their dealings, and can unite the masses. Under the unified leadership of the team committee, each team committee member has a clear division of labor. The team committee meets every three to five days to report on the work situation and to arrange the work. After the work is arranged, the team committee members go to the work groups according to their division of labor to implement it. In the work, if there are temporary problems, the team leader consults with the team committee on a temporary basis.

    They pay great attention to giving play to the role of the work group leaders. The team leader does not directly deal with matters within the work group, but deals with them through the work group leader. Comrade Yang Lijun, the team leader (now promoted to deputy leader of the production team), said that this is very important. He said that in work, one should not "grab blindly," but should handle things according to the organizational system, "whoever is in charge should be in charge, whoever should handle it should handle it." If one grabs blindly, it will "destroy the organization, disrupt the system, and spoil the work." (Editor's Note: That's right. Leaders at any level should not grab blindly at lower-level organizations, should not take over everything, and should not force orders, but should give full play to the role of lower-level organizations and cadres.)

    Because the team committee members and work group leaders all have a clear division of labor, with authority, power, and responsibility, everyone is more and more enthusiastic and capable. Now, the work group leaders have a set of methods for quota management, labor organization, work arrangement, and political and ideological work. With everyone sharing the burden, the team leader's burden is also reduced, so that he can both take the lead in labor and have time to consider the overall work arrangements and do political and ideological work. We saw that Comrade Yang Lijun, the team leader, was indeed busy but not chaotic, tense but happy. He arranges work every three to five days, and after the arrangement, he lets everyone do it. His daily activities mainly include three items: one is to lead (take the lead in labor), two is to help (help the work group solve problems), and three is to check (check the progress of production work). Comrade Yang Lijun is both a good actor (taking the lead in production) and a good director (commanding production). He sings well himself, and leads everyone to sing well. (Editor's Note: That's right! The team leader is not only an actor but, more importantly, a director. Some of our team leaders are indeed loyal, conscientious, and wholeheartedly want to do their work well, but they have not yet learned Comrade Yang Lijun's set of methods. They only know how to be busy themselves, worry themselves, and be anxious themselves, and do not know how to establish a system of collective leadership and division of responsibilities, or how to give play to the role of the team committee, deputy team leaders, and work group leaders. Therefore, although they are busy to the point of being overwhelmed, they often neglect one thing while attending to another, and cannot do their work very well. We suggest that comrades study the experience of the Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team's committee and Comrade Yang Lijun's working methods, and study how to establish and improve the team's system of collective leadership and division of responsibilities, and how to truly achieve "a thousand pounds of burden for everyone to share" instead of one person carrying it.)

    Labor Organization and Responsibility System
    The labor organization form of this team is mainly based on fixed field work groups and various specialized groups (such as cattle work teams, sideline occupation groups, and various life service groups, etc.), supplemented by temporary shock teams. The work groups are mainly divided according to the reasonable allocation of living conditions and strength, and also appropriately take into account the opinions of individual commune members. (Editor's Note: We believe that this division of work groups is correct. In some places, it is proposed that work groups should be freely combined, and whoever wants to be with whom can be together, which is not appropriate. This is not conducive to the rational allocation of strength, is not conducive to strengthening organization and discipline, and may also produce other abuses.) Each work group is fixedly responsible for a certain piece of land (i.e., the responsibility area as commonly said. A work group does not necessarily have only one piece, some may have two, some may have three, in order to stagger the work). Once fixed, it remains unchanged throughout the year, and is responsible to the end from planting to harvesting. This establishes the most basic responsibility system for field work, which is conducive to carrying out labor competitions between groups, is conducive to improving the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of commune members, and is conducive to distinguishing between high and low according to the production results of each work group when implementing the reward and compensation system.

    What to do when encountering shock work (such as threshing, rushing to plant, rushing to harvest, fighting against disasters, large-scale basic farmland construction, etc.)? That is to draw people from each work group to form temporary shock teams (such as threshing groups, transplanting groups, etc.). After the task is completed, they still return to their original work groups. This will not disrupt the fixed work groups. At the same time, in the shock work, they are also organized into groups, elect group leaders, and adhere to a set of rules such as work evaluation, work point recording, and quality inspection. In this way, the regular work and the shock work, the usual responsibility system and the temporary responsibility system are well combined, and the foundation is the fixed work group. (Editor's Note: This is very important, it is a fundamental issue in labor management. In some places, the contradiction between the responsibility system for regular field work and the temporary work has not been well resolved. In some teams, although there are fixed work groups, the work groups are disrupted when temporary work comes, resulting in the phenomenon of no one being specifically responsible for the management work of regular fields. Comrades in these places should pay attention to studying the successful experience of the Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team.)

    The Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team has a set of relatively complete, practical, and feasible rules formulated through mass discussions in all aspects of its work. And this set of rules is implemented under the supervision of the masses. They have always adhered to the work evaluation, work point recording, quota management, quality inspection, and reward and punishment systems. Not only is there a set of quotas for regular work, but also quotas are generally formulated in advance for shock work. Each work group has a work point recorder, who records the work points for the day on the same day. When recording work points, it is combined with quality inspection. If the quality is not good, it must be reworked or work points will be deducted. In addition to the responsibility system for field work, there is also a set of systems for pig raising, vegetable growing, running canteens, engaging in sideline occupations, and managing cattle and farm tools. There are rules and regulations, and rewards and punishments are clearly defined.

    "Five Tiger Generals"
    The "Five Tiger Generals" of this team are well-known far and wide. They are: Yang Lifu (member of the Communist Youth League, formerly deputy team leader and work group leader, now the team leader), Ma Duxiu (member of the Communist Youth League, women's team leader and work group leader), Yang Mingcai (member of the Communist Party, technical team leader and work group leader), Yang Mingsheng (member of the Communist Youth League, work group leader), and Yang Lifang (member of the Communist Youth League, work group leader). They each have their own specialties and their own tempers. Some are cotton experts, and some are rice transplanting experts. Their common characteristics are: they are young and strong, not afraid of difficulties, good at charging into battle, and have a high degree of communist style.

    In this team, the "Five Tiger Generals" were recognized by the masses as early as 1958. They have made outstanding achievements in a series of struggles such as deep plowing, disaster resistance, water conservancy construction, and the transformation of backward fields, which is convincing. Last autumn, on the Shahe Reservoir construction site, the Flying Tigers team, with the "Five Tiger Generals" as the backbone, maintained an undefeated record in four battles in the competition with the third company of the Lutou Commune's militia, the shock team of the Xinshi Commune, the shock team of the Yangdang Commune, and the shock team of the Taiping Commune. Since then, the "Five Tiger Generals" have become famous throughout the county.

    Wherever there is the most difficulty and hardship, the "Five Tiger Generals" rush to it. In the cold winter, when underwater operations are required, they always take the lead in jumping into the water; during the New Year and holidays, they always volunteer to stay on duty at the construction site and persist in the battle, while letting others go home to celebrate the festival. Their greatest advantage is that they are good at uniting the masses. Each of them has united a group of activists around them (accounting for about 30% of the team's labor force), forming a strong activist layer. Each activist has united a group of people around them, so that all the commune members in the team are brought up. Take Ma Duxiu, the female general among the "Five Tiger Generals," for example. She closely united more than a dozen young female activists such as Liu Guizhen and Zhang Sirong, forming a combat group known as the "Eight Sisters and Nine Younger Sisters." This combat group has few rivals in transplanting, land reclamation, and water conservancy construction. Striving to be a "Five Tiger General" has become the goal of many commune members (especially young people) in this team, and new "tiger generals" are constantly emerging. Now, Yang Liyin, Yan Jialiang, He Deyu, etc. are already recognized by the masses as new "tiger generals." (Editor's Note: The so-called "Five Tiger Generals" are the leading figures who are recognized by the masses as being smart, capable, and fair. If each team has several such figures, and they unite a group of activists through them, and then the activists unite the broad masses, then everything will be easy to handle.)

    Cadres Care About and Are Considerate of People
    The team cadres, headed by Comrade Yang Lijun, are all from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds. Through the cultivation and education of the Party and the tempering of practical work, they all have a relatively high level of political awareness and a relatively strong working ability. This is a fundamental guarantee for the success of this team's work.

    Team leader Yang Lijun worked as a hired laborer for eight years. He was originally the head of the "Five Tiger Generals" and a model team leader in Zaoyang County. Now he serves as the deputy team leader of the production team. The masses' evaluation of him is: "He doesn't talk much, but every sentence is spoken to the heart," "He knows how to calculate, arrange, and deploy troops." (Editor's Note: To be a team leader, you must know how to deploy troops, be resourceful, and be decisive. It is not enough to rely on brute force.) He cares about the masses and is considerate of the masses. The masses trust him and love him. If a commune member gets sick, he always goes to see them as soon as he gets the news. If the illness is serious, he immediately sends them to the hospital. If the illness is mild, he repeatedly tells them to rest assured and recover, and "do not participate in production until you are well." The sick commune members are often moved to tears, and their enthusiasm is doubled after they recover. The more enthusiastic the masses are, the more he cares about them, and even "orders" them to rest. This year, when rushing to harvest wheat, some old women insisted on participating. He was afraid of exhausting these old women, and repeatedly asked them to start work late and leave work early, and stipulated that each person could only cut five bundles of wheat a day at most, and should not exceed this limit. However, the more he cared about them, the greater their enthusiasm, and the less they felt tired. As a result, each person cut twenty bundles of wheat a day, which was equivalent to the work of one and a half laborers. (Editor's Note: The Party has repeatedly instructed that labor and rest must be combined well. Comrade Yang Lijun has deeply understood the spirit of this instruction. He is not only good at leading the masses to work, but also good at leading the masses to rest. Because he is good at leading rest, he is good at leading work.) Under the leadership of Comrade Yang Lijun, the other cadres of the team are also very caring and considerate. The team's canteen, vegetable growing, and recreational activities are all done relatively well. Yang Lilan, a well-known red flag bearer on the cultural and educational front, is a young woman from this team.

    Yang Lijun can both let go and give full play to the role of cadres and activists, is good at encouraging them to move forward, and is also good at helping them overcome shortcomings and mistakes. He is good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. When criticizing the shortcomings and mistakes of others, he makes good use of the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." In his own words, it is "soft at both ends and hard in the middle." He also said that there should be less criticism and more education of cadres. He used this method to effectively help and unite comrades, so that everyone could make progress together. For example, Yang Lifu, one of the "Five Tiger Generals," has a relatively impatient temper and a relatively harsh attitude towards the masses, and the masses have some opinions about him. After Yang Lijun discovered this, he patiently talked to him, saying that shouting at the masses would only cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and would only be harmful and not beneficial to the work. With his help, Yang Lifu gradually overcame his shortcomings. Now Yang Lifu has been elected as the team leader and is deeply supported by the masses. Yang Lijun never adopts simple methods for some commune members with conservative ideas. For example, commune member Yang Lianan is an old farmer with rich production experience, but he originally did not believe in advanced technologies such as close planting and pruning of cotton. He said that these were the tricks of people who "drink foreign rice soup." Yang Lijun did not argue with him loudly, but mobilized him to visit advanced areas. He saw that the closely planted and pruned cotton grew very well in other places, and when he came back, he became an active advocate and promoter of close planting and pruning. The masses joked that he also started drinking "foreign rice soup."

    II. The "Logistics Department" of the Sanlimiao Team
    The "logistics" work of the Sanlimiao Team is particularly outstanding. It has a good "logistics department" with three old commune members as the core. These three old commune members are: Guo Wenzhi (responsible for storage and cashier), Luo Mingfa (responsible for raising pigs), and Zhang Luyun (responsible for growing vegetables). They are all from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds, are diligent, thrifty, upright, and like to meddle in "other people's business." They like to speak frankly, are serious and reliable in their work, and never tolerate bad phenomena such as waste, failure to abide by rules, and speculation. Therefore, although their "assigned" tasks are storage, cashier, pig raising, and vegetable growing, they actually manage much more than that. They manage the canteen, the threshing ground, the ponds, the trees, and even the family disputes of the commune members. In the words of the masses, they are "in charge of everything under the sun; they only recognize reason, not people, and they are the same to King Yama." (Editor's Note: Our people's communes need more people who like to meddle in "other people's business" and "only recognize reason, not people." These people love the commune like their home and take the commune as their home. These people are the true masters of the people's commune. All cadres and commune members should love every blade of grass and every tree in the people's commune, and should treat the affairs of the people's commune with this attitude.) They like to manage things, and others are also convinced by their management. Because they manage well and manage reasonably.

    Guo Wenzhi has been working as a storekeeper since 1956: managing farm tools, managing the threshing ground, and managing money. He is illiterate and cannot keep accounts, and can only draw circles. Later, he found a "trick" and found a poor peasant with a relatively high level of education to be his "secretary." (Editor's Note: The leadership should care about such cadres and take concrete measures to help them get rid of illiteracy.) His rules are strict, he does not show favoritism, and he does not compromise. Whoever asks him to collect something must give a note, and whoever damages something must pay compensation. Over the years, he has not missed a single penny in the money he has handled. Once, there were twenty yuan that did not match the accounts, but after checking, it was found that the accountant had double-counted the accounts. None of the farm tools he manages have been lost. He cares for public property meticulously. Last year, when threshing, it rained heavily at night, and some commune members took the grain sacks used to hold grain home as raincoats. He immediately went door-to-door to collect them, and spent two days mending the sixty damaged sacks. Usually, he sleeps in the warehouse, and during threshing, he sleeps on the threshing ground. Last year, the grain sold to the state could not be transported away for a while, and he slept on the threshing ground until the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, until all the grain was transported away. He hates evil like an enemy. In 1956, the team's accountant privately divided and occupied more than his share, and he immediately exposed and reported it. Based on his suggestion, the accountant was dismissed. Now he also manages the canteen and weighs the grain used in the canteen himself. He arranges everything properly for each meal, the processing of rice and flour, etc. The team's canteen is a famous red flag canteen.

    Luo Mingfa is a famous model for raising pigs. Zhang Luyun was originally a team leader. Because he was old, he has been in charge of growing vegetables since last autumn. They are all old people like Guo Wenzhi who are loyal, responsible, and hate evil like an enemy. They have all made outstanding achievements in their work. When Luo Mingfa took over the pig farm last winter, there were only two pigs. Now, it has developed to twenty-one pigs. Zhang Luyun leads four laborers to grow twenty-six mu of vegetable land (the team averages 1.5 fen per person for basic vegetable land), the stubble arrangement is good, and the yield is high. Now, each person in the team can eat three to four jin of fresh vegetables every day, and the canteen also has more than 1,200 jin of dried vegetables and six kinds of pickled vegetables totaling more than 3,000 jin.

    This team is a key team of the production team. Under the specific leadership of the Party branch secretary, the team leader (a young female comrade) relies on the specific management of these three old people to comprehensively establish the "logistics" work. The team's canteen is well run, the vegetables are well grown, the pigs are well raised, and the farm tools are well managed. Because these things are well done, the cadres and the masses are relieved of "worries" and can concentrate on production. Therefore, production is also well done, with overproduction and awards year after year. (Editor's Note: "An army cannot move without food and fodder." "Logistics" work is very important. If "logistics" work is not done well, production cannot be done well. The Sanlimiao Team provides a good experience on how to do "logistics" work well. Every team has some diligent and upright people from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds like Guo Wenzhi, Luo Mingfa, and Zhang Luyun. If they are selected and entrusted with the important task of specifically managing "logistics" work, and the leadership regularly gives them support and help, the "logistics" work will definitely be done in an orderly manner.)

    III. The Cattle Work Team of the Tanjiawan Team
    Most teams in Zaoyang County have a cattle work team (specifically responsible for feeding and using cattle), and the cattle work team of the Tanjiawan Team is a particularly good one. Here, whoever feeds the cattle uses them, and feeding and use are unified. There is a relatively complete system for the feeding and management of cattle. There is a good cattle work team leader, and the production team leader can give full play to the role of the cattle work team leader.

    Before the summer of 1959, the team's cattle were raised centrally in two places, and feeding and use were separated. Those who fed the cattle did not use them, and those who used the cattle did not feed them. Those who fed the cattle were only afraid of exhausting the cattle, and those who used the cattle were only afraid of not completing the farming tasks. In addition, there was no complete system, so there was often wrangling between feeding and use. As a result, some cattle were fed poorly, and some tasks were not completed on time. Since the summer of 1959, a unified cattle work team for feeding and use was established, and a set of systems for the feeding, management, and use of cattle was formulated. Tan Shusheng, who came from an old hired laborer background, was elected as the cattle work team leader, and the composition of the cattle work team was adjusted. Since then, the situation of the cattle has rapidly changed. In the past, half of the cattle were not fed well. Now, most of the cattle are fed very well. Although the team encountered a severe drought last winter and spring that had not been seen in more than seventy years, and the feed was insufficient, there were no abnormal deaths of cattle. In addition, four calves were added, and three cows were pregnant. During this period, the cattle work was also done particularly well, which greatly promoted production. (Editor's Note: Cattle are still the main power for agricultural production. To do a good job in production, it is necessary to manage the cattle well. The method of the cattle work team in Zaoyang County is worthy of emulation by all regions.)

    The main feeding and management systems are as follows: First, the cattle work is all assigned by the cattle work team leader. The team leader only puts forward tasks, and the specific assignment of which cattle to do what on that day is determined by the cattle work team leader. The team leader does not directly assign cattle. Second, the cattle are regularly ranked, inspected, and compared (usually once every seven days) to see who is feeding well and who is not feeding well. Those who have gained weight are rewarded, and those who have lost weight for no reason are criticized and given a deadline to feed them well. Those who have not fed them well by the deadline will have work points deducted. Third, cattle work includes three types of work points: feeding, using, and manure collection, which are recorded separately. The work points for feeding cattle are recorded by the day, the work points for using cattle are recorded according to the quota, and the work points for manure collection are recorded according to the quantity and quality. Fourth, cows with reproductive capacity must be bred and reproduced. Those who have been bred and become pregnant will be rewarded, and those who are barren or have caused fetal abortion for no reason will be punished. Calves that are bred will be priced after one year, and the breeders will be given a certain percentage of the reward. For the death of cattle, the line between "four compensations and two no compensations" is drawn. The "four compensations" are: compensation for deaths caused by poor management; compensation for deaths caused by failure to report and treat illnesses; compensation for deaths caused by beatings and overwork; and compensation for losses (compensation for a portion of the value of the cattle based on specific circumstances). The "two no compensations" are: no compensation for deaths due to old age; no compensation for deaths due to timely reporting of illness and ineffective treatment. Fifth, according to the severity of the work, the work is divided into three grades. According to the size and strength of the cattle, the cattle are also divided into three grades. Large cattle do heavy work, and small cattle do light work. The cattle are assigned work according to their abilities, and the work is matched to the cattle. Sixth, the tools for cattle work (such as plows, harrows, cattle carts, etc.) are kept uniformly by the cattle work team or by the breeders on a household basis, depending on the circumstances.

    The team has made such great achievements in cattle management in the past year, and the cattle work team leader, Tan Shusheng, has played a major role in addition to the system. He started herding cattle for landlords at the age of nine, and has been a hired laborer for more than twenty years. He is proficient in all aspects of agricultural production, and is especially good at raising and using cattle. What is especially valuable is that he has a high degree of responsibility, is extremely concerned about public interests, and cares for cattle immensely. He knows the temperaments and characteristics of all the twenty or so cattle in the team. He arranges everything properly for what the cattle are suitable for, how they should be fed, and when they should rest. He can detect any illness in the cattle in a timely manner, and personally treats the cattle and takes care of the sick cattle until they recover. He goes to the fields every morning and evening, and promptly suggests to the team leader which fields should be plowed and harrowed, and makes arrangements. Sometimes, some of the cattle need to go out to do transportation and cooperation, and he wants to go with them, but he is afraid that no one will manage them at home; if he does not go, he is afraid that something will happen outside. To solve this problem, he has trained several assistants. When the cattle are going to other places, several people separate, some manage the affairs outside, and some manage the affairs at home.

    The team leader is a comrade who was transferred from the army. He is active and capable in his work. Although he is not very knowledgeable about production, he is good at relying on the masses, especially at giving full play to the role of Tan Shusheng, the cattle work team leader. He arranges all the cattle work specifically through Tan Shusheng. He humbly adopts all the good suggestions made by Tan Shusheng on feeding, managing, using cattle, and other aspects of production. In this way, Tan Shusheng becomes more and more enthusiastic and becomes a very helpful assistant to him. Relying on the leadership of the Party, relying on some assistants like Tan Shusheng, and giving full play to their role, this ensures that he can lead the work of the entire team well.

    These three teams each have their own strengths and weaknesses. We feel that if we concentrate their experience, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, it can become a relatively complete method for the work of the production team. If a team has a sound team committee like the Dengjia Store Zhongdian Team and a system of collective leadership and division of responsibilities, a responsibility system for field work, and a group of "tiger generals" who are closely connected with the masses; has a "logistics department" like the Sanlimiao Team; and has a cattle work team like the Tanjiawan Team and a set of methods for managing cattle, then there is no reason why production and life cannot be done well.

    We also feel that to improve the working methods of the team, it is necessary to improve the working methods of the leadership at the production team level and above at the same time. The production team is the basic accounting unit, and production and life are all planned and deployed by it in a unified manner. If the work of the production team is disorganized and everything is grabbed blindly, the work of the team cannot be done well. The success of the work of these three teams is inseparable from the leadership of the production team. The Jinxing First Production Team, the Zhongsu Production Team, and the Guoguang Production Team are all relatively advanced production teams, and the work of the teams under their jurisdiction is relatively good. These three teams are also key teams of the production team, and the Party branch secretaries of the production team often live in these teams to specifically help the comrades of the team arrange and carry out the work. At the same time, after they have gained experience here, they promptly promote it throughout the production team, combining points and areas, using points to lead areas, which drives the work of the entire production team.

    Most of the cadres of our production teams are loyal, intelligent, and capable people, and there are many "brave generals" and "strategists" among the masses who are loyal to the socialist cause. We think that as long as the leading comrades at all levels go deep into the grassroots, discover them, help them, and give full play to their role, then every team will be "full of brave generals and strategists," and will be invincible and invincible in all kinds of work.

    介绍三个生产小队的领导方法

    编者按：这是7月3日《湖北日报》上发表的一篇文章。在发表这篇文章的时候，该报同时发表了龚同文同志《一竿子插到底》的文章。《湖北日报》在发表这篇文章时曾加了编者按语，按语说：“人民公社是生产和生活的组织者，而生产小队是生产、生活最直接最具体的组织者。小队工作的好坏，对生产、生活有很大的影响。怎样搞好小队的工作？根据这篇文章所介绍的经验，主要是两条：一条是人的问题，一条是制度的问题。所谓人的问题，就是在生产队党支部的领导下，要有一个好的小队长，一个健全的队委会，以队委会为核心团结一批积极分子，再通过积极分子去团结全体社员群众。所谓制度问题，就是在生产、生活各个方面都要有一套适合集体生产、集体生活需要的切实可行的规矩，并且认真执行。人民公社化以后，经过几次的整社，生产小队的工作有很大的改进，但是现在还存在不少问题，例如小队的领导方法问题，经营管理问题等都迫切需要研究解决。小队的工作不但是很重要的，而且是很复杂的，搞好并不简单。这就要求各级党委更加重视小队的工作，总结小队的工作经验，加强对小队的领导和帮助。如果认为小队的工作没有什么了不起，搞好搞坏无关大局，或者认为不费多大力气就能搞好，因而就不深入小队，不认真研究小队的工作问题，那就不对了。”我们认为这篇文章所介绍的经验很好，特将全文转载，供各地农村工作同志研究学习。文中的编者按语均为《湖北日报》所加。
    最近我们到枣阳县各个公社跑了个把月，着重了解了一下生产小队的领导方法和经营管理问题。这个县大多数小队的工作都搞得比较好，而从我们所了解到的情况看来，鹿头公社金星第一生产队邓家店中店小队（第四小队）、环城公社中苏生产队三里庙小队和国光生产队檀家湾小队的工作尤其出色。这三个小队，干部作风深入、细致、扎实，群众情绪高涨；在生产、生活上都有一套比较好的领导方法和经营管理制度，都搞的很有成绩。它们给人的总的印象是：工作紧张而又有条有理，干劲十足而又有劳有逸，上下一条心，生气勃勃。这几个小队的工作又各有特点，现在分别介绍如下：
    一、邓家店中店小队
    这个小队的特点是：有一个坚强的队委会和一个能干的小队长，有一套健全的集体领导、分工负责的制度；劳动管理搞的好，在生产工作上有一套严密的组织和规矩；有闻名全县的“五虎上将”；干部关心人，体贴人，善于作政治思想工作。
    集体领导、分工负责
    小队队委会的委员，除队长外，还有负责副业、生活、技术、妇女等方面工作的副队长和各个作业组长。他们都是群众民主选举出来的。他们的政治思想觉悟都比较高，工作积极肯干，办事公道，能团结群众。在队委会的统一领导下，每一个队委委员都有明确的分工。队委会每三、五天开一次会，汇报一次工作情况，布置一次工作。工作布置后，队委委员就按照分工各自到作业组去贯彻执行。在工作中，临时有问题，队长就临时和队委商量。
    他们很注意发挥作业组长的作用。凡是作业组内部的事情，队长不直接出面处理，而是通过作业组长去处理。小队队长杨立钧同志（现在已提升为生产队副队长）说这一条很要紧。他说，在工作上不能“乱抓”，而要根据组织制度办事情，“该谁管的谁管，该谁办的谁办”，一乱抓，就会把“组织抓垮，制度抓乱，工作抓糟”。（编者按：说得对。任何一级领导对下级组织都不能乱抓，不能包办代替，不能强迫命令，而应当充分发挥下级组织和干部的作用。）
    由于队委委员和作业组长都有明确的分工，有职、有权、有责，所以大家越干越起劲，越干越能干。现在各个作业组长对定额管理、劳动组织、活路安排和政治思想工作都有一套办法。担子大家分挑，队长的负担也就减轻了，既能够带头劳动，又有时间考虑全队的工作安排和做政治思想工作。我们看到小队长杨立钧同志的确是忙而不乱，紧张而又愉快。他三、五天安排一次工作，安排后就放手让大家去干。他自己的日常活动主要是三项：一带（带头劳动）、二帮（帮助作业组解决问题）、三检查（检查生产工作的进行情况）。杨立钧同志既是一个好演员（带头生产），又是一个好导演（指挥生产），自己唱的好，又领导大家都唱的好。（编者按：对！小队长不仅是一个演员，更重要的是一个导演。现在我们有些小队长的确是忠心耿耿，任劳任怨，一心一意想把工作作好，但是他们还没有学会杨立钧同志的这一套办法。他们只知道一个人忙，一个人操心，一个人着急，而不知道怎样建立集体领导、分工负责的制度，怎样发挥队委会、副队长和作业组长的作用。所以他们虽然忙得不可开交，还往往是顾了东头丢了西头，不能把工作作得很好。我们建议同志们学习一下邓家店中店小队队委会的经验和杨立钧同志的工作方法，研究一下怎样建立和健全小队的集体领导、分工负责的制度，怎样真正作到“千斤担子万人挑”而不是一个人挑。）
    劳动组织和责任制度
    这个小队的劳动组织形式是以固定的田间作业组和各种专业组（如牛工队、副业组和各种生活服务性的小组等）为主，以临时性的突击组为辅。作业组主要是根据居住条件和力量的合理配置来划分，同时也适当照顾社员个人的意见。（编者按：我们认为这样划分作业组是对头的。有的地方提出作业组自由结合，谁愿意和谁在一起就在一起，是不妥当的。这不利于合理地配置力量，不利于加强组织性和纪律性，还可能产生其他流弊。）每一个作业组固定负责一定的田片（即通常说的责任片。一个作业组，不一定只有一片，有的可能是两片，有的可能是三片，以便于错开活路）。一经固定，常年不变，从种到收负责到底。这就为田间工作确立了一项最基本的责任制度，便于开展组与组之间的劳动竞赛，便于提高社员的责任心和积极性，便于在执行奖赔制度的时候根据各作业组的生产成绩而分出高低。
    碰到突击性的工作（如打场、抢种、抢收，抗灾斗争，大规模的农田基本建设等）怎么办？那就是从各作业组抽人组成临时性的突击队伍（如打场组、插秧组等），任务完成后，仍各回原来的作业组。这就不至于打乱固定的作业组。同时在突击工作中，也是编成小组，推选组长，坚持评工记分、质量检查等一套规矩。这样，就把经常性的工作和突击性的工作，平时的责任制度和临时的责任制度很好地结合起来，而基础则是固定的作业组。（编者按：这一条是十分重要的，这是劳动管理中的一个根本问题。现在有些地方还没有很好解决经常性的田间工作责任制度和突击性的活路之间的矛盾。有的小队虽然有固定的作业组，但是临时活路一来，就把作业组打乱了，因而造成了经常性的田间管理工作无专人负责的现象。请这些地方的同志们注意研究一下邓家店中店小队的成功经验。）
    邓家店中店小队在各项工作中都有一套经群众讨论制定的比较完整的切实可行的规矩。并且在群众的监督下贯彻执行了这套规矩。他们一直坚持评工记分、定额管理、质量检查和奖惩制度。不但经常性的活路有一套定额，突击性的工作一般也都是事先制订定额。每个作业组都有一个记工员，当天做的工分当天记。记工分的时候结合检查质量，质量不好的要返工或者扣工分。除了田间工作的责任制外，在养猪、种菜、办食堂、搞副业和耕牛农具的管理等方面也都有一套制度，有规有矩，奖罚分明。
    “五虎上将”
    这个小队的“五虎上将”是远近闻名的。他们是：杨立富（团员，原为副小队长兼作业组长，现在是小队队长），马笃秀（团员，妇女队长兼作业组长），杨明才（党员，技术队长兼作业组长），杨明升（团员，作业组长），杨立方（团员，作业组长）。他们各有各的特长，各有各的脾气，有的是棉花专家，有的是插秧能手。他们共同的特点是：年青力壮，不怕困难，善于冲锋陷阵，有很高的共产主义风格。
    在这个小队，“五虎上将”早在1958年就得到了群众的公认。他们在深翻、抗灾、修水利、改造落后田等一系列的斗争中都有突出的成绩，令人口服心服。去年秋天，在沙河水库工地上，以“五虎上将”为骨干组成的飞虎队，在同鹿头公社基干民兵第三连、新市公社突击队、杨壋公社突击队和太平公社突击队的对手竞赛中，四战四捷，保持不败纪录。从这之后，“五虎上将”就闻名全县了。
    哪里最困难，最艰苦，“五虎上将”就奔向哪里。在严寒的冬天，需要进行水中作业时，他们总是带头跳下水去；过年过节，他们总是自愿留在工地值勤，坚持战斗，而让别人回家欢度佳节。他们最大的优点是善于团结群众。他们每一个人的周围都团结了一批积极分子（总共约占全小队劳动力的30％），形成了一个坚强的积极分子层。每一个积极分子的周围又都团结了一批群众，这样就把全队的社员都带起来了。拿“五虎上将”中的女将马笃秀来说，她就紧紧地团结了刘桂珍、张四容等十多个女青年积极分子，组成了一个被人称为“八姐九妹”的战斗组，这个战斗组无论在插秧、改田和水利工地上都是少有对手的。争取做“五虎上将”，成了这个小队许多社员（尤其是年青人）的奋斗目标，新的“虎将”正在不断出现。现在，杨立银、严家良、何德玉等就已经是群众公认的新的“虎将”了。（编者按：所谓“五虎上将”，就是被群众公认的聪明、能干、公道的领袖人物。如果每一个小队都有几个这样的人物，通过他们去团结一批积极分子，再通过积极分子去团结广大群众。这样，什么事情都好办了。）
    干部关心人体贴人
    以杨立钧同志为首的小队干部都是出身于贫雇农，经过党的培养教育和实际工作的锻炼，都有比较高的政治觉悟和比较强的工作能力。这是这个小队工作能够搞得出色的一条根本保证。
    小队长杨立钧作过八年长工，他原是“五虎上将”之首，是枣阳县的模范小队长，现在担任生产队的副队长。群众对他的评价是：“不多说话，但是句句说在人的心坎上”，“会划算，会安排，会用兵遣将”。（编者按：当一个小队长，一定要会用兵遣将，多谋善断，单凭一夫之勇是不行的。）他很关心群众，体贴群众；群众信任他，爱戴他。社员生了病，他总是一得讯就亲自去看，病重的立即送进医院，病轻的他也要再三嘱咐安心休养，“病不好不准参加生产”。生病的社员往往被感动得流泪，病好后总是干劲倍增。群众越是干劲大的时候，他越是关心群众，甚至“命令”群众休息。今年抢割麦子时，一些老太婆也一定要参加。他生怕把这些老太婆累坏了，再三要她们晚上工，早下工，并且规定每人每天顶多只割五个麦捆，不准超过。可是他越是关心她们，她们的劲头越是大，越是感不到累，结果每人每天割到了二十个麦捆，抵上了一个半劳力干的活。（编者按：党一再指示，必须搞好劳逸结合。杨立钧同志是深深领会了这个指示的精神。他不但善于领导群众工作，而且善于领导群众休息。正因为他善于领导休息，所以善于领导工作。）在杨立钧同志的带领下，小队的其他干部也都很关心人，体贴人。这个小队的食堂、种菜和文娱活动都是搞得比较好的，文教战线上著名的红旗手杨立兰就是这个小队的一位姑娘。
    对干部和积极分子，杨立钧既能放手发挥他们的作用，善于鼓舞他们前进，又善于帮助他们克服缺点和错误。他善于运用批评和自我批评的武器。批评别人的缺点错误时，他很好地运用了“团结——批评——团结”这个公式，用他自己的话说是“两头软中间硬”。他还说对干部要少批评多教育。他用这个办法有效地帮助和团结了同志，使大家能够共同进步。比如，“五虎上将”之一的杨立富，脾气比较急躁，对群众的态度比较生硬，群众对他有些意见。杨立钧发现后，就耐心地和他谈，说对群众大喊大叫只会引起群众的不满，对工作只有坏处没有好处。杨立富在他的帮助下，逐渐克服了自己的缺点。现在杨立富已被选为小队队长，深得群众拥护。对一些有保守思想的社员，杨立钧也从来不采取简单的办法。例如社员杨立安是个有丰富生产经验的老农，但是原来他总不相信棉花密植、整枝等这一套先进技术。他说这些是“喝洋米汤”的人的名堂。杨立钧没有和他大吵大闹，而是动员他到先进地区去参观。他在外地看到密植、整过枝的棉花都长得很好，回来就变成宣传和推行密植、整枝的积极分子了。群众好意地笑他也喝起“洋米汤”来了。
    二、三里庙小队的“后勤部”
    三里庙小队的“后勤”工作特别出色。它有一个以三位老社员为核心的很好的“后勤部”。这三位老社员是：郭文志（负责保管出纳），罗明发（负责养猪），张禄运（负责种菜）。他们都是贫雇农出身，为人勤俭、正直，爱管“闲事”，爱说直话，办事认真牢靠，对浪费、不守规矩、投机取巧等坏现象绝不容忍。所以虽然他们“份内”的事情是保管、出纳、养猪、种菜，可是实际上他们管的比这要宽得多。食堂、稻场、塘堰、树木乃至于社员的家庭纠纷，他们都管。拿群众的话说，他们是“上管天，下管地；只认理，不认人，对阎王老子都一样”。（编者按：我们的人民公社需要更多的这种爱管“闲事”而又“只认理不认人”的人，这种人爱社如家，以社为家。这种人是人民公社的真正的主人。所有的干部和社员都应当热爱人民公社的一草一木，都应当用这样的态度对待人民公社的事情。）他们爱管事，别人也服他们管。因为他们管的好，管的有理。
    郭文志从1956年起就做保管：管农具、管稻场、管钱。他不识字，不会记账，只会打圈圈。后来找了一个“窍门”，找了一个文化程度比较高的贫农当“秘书”。（编者按：领导上要关心这样的干部，要采取具体措施帮助他们脱离文盲状态。）他的规矩严格，不讲情面，不通融。无论谁向他领东西都要打条子，无论谁弄坏了东西该赔的都要赔。几年来，他经手的钱没有错过一文，有一次有二十元与账目不符，但一查对是会计的账记重了。他经管的农具没有丢失过一件。他对公物爱护得无微不至。去年打场时，夜间下大雨，有些社员把装粮食的麻袋当雨衣披回家去了。他随即就挨家挨户去收，并且用两天时间把破损了的六十条麻袋都补好了。平常他睡在仓库，打场的时候他就睡到稻场。去年卖给国家的粮食一时运不走，他在稻场睡到腊月二十八，直到把粮食全部运走为止。他疾恶如仇，1956年小队的会计私分多占，他立即就揭发检举，根据他的建议把这个会计撤职了。现在他又兼管食堂，食堂用粮他亲自过秤。每顿的饭菜、米面的加工等他都安排得妥妥贴贴。这个小队的食堂是著名的红旗食堂。
    罗明发是著名的养猪模范。张禄运原来是个小队长，因为年纪老了，去年秋天起专管种菜。他们都是和郭文志那样忠心耿耿，认真负责，疾恶如仇的老人。他们在工作上都做出了出色的成绩。罗明发去年冬天接管养猪场时只有两头猪，现在发展到了二十一头。张禄运领导四个劳动力种二十六亩菜地（全小队平均每人有基本菜地一分五厘），茬口安排的好，产量高。现在这个小队每人每天能吃到三、四斤鲜菜，食堂还存有干菜一千二百多斤，腌菜六种共三千多斤。
    这个小队是生产队的重点队。小队队长（一位青年妇女同志）在党支部书记的具体领导下，依靠这三位老人的具体经管，全面地把“后勤”工作建立起来了。这个小队的食堂办的好，菜种的好，猪养的好，农具保管的好。由于这几件事情办好了，干部和群众免除了“后顾之忧”，可以一条心搞生产，因此生产也就搞的好，连年超产，连年得奖。（编者按：“兵马未动，粮草先行”。“后勤”工作是十分重要的，“后勤”工作搞不好，生产不可能搞好。怎样搞好“后勤”工作，三里庙小队提供了一条很好的经验。每一个小队都有像郭文志、罗明发、张禄运这样一些贫雇农出身的勤俭、正直的人，把他们挑选出来，委之以具体经管“后勤”工作的重任，领导上经常给以支持帮助，“后勤”工作就一定会搞的有条有理。）
    三、檀家湾小队的牛工队
    枣阳县绝大部分小队都有牛工队（专管喂牛、用牛）的组织，檀家湾小队的牛工队是搞得特别好的一个。在这里，耕牛谁喂谁用，喂、用统一；耕牛的饲养管理有一套比较完整的制度；有一个很好的牛工队长，生产小队的队长又能充分发挥牛工队长的作用。
    1959年夏天以前，这个小队的耕牛是分两处集中喂养的，喂牛和用牛是分开的，喂牛的不用牛，用牛的不喂牛。喂牛的只怕把耕牛累坏了，用牛的只怕完不成耕作任务，再加上没有一套完整的制度，因此喂、用之间往往扯皮，而结果有些牛喂瘦了，有些任务也没有按时完成。1959年夏天起建立了喂、用统一的牛工队，并制定了一套耕牛饲养、管理和使用的制度，选举了老长工出身的檀恕生当牛工队长，调整了牛工队人员的成份，此后耕牛的情况就迅速改观了。过去有一半的牛喂的不好，现在，绝大部分的牛都喂得很好。虽然1959年碰上了七十多年来没有过的大旱灾，去冬今春的饲料不足，但是没有发生耕牛不正常的死亡现象，并且还增添了四头小牛，还有三头母牛怀了孕。这期间牛工的活路也干的特别好，大大地促进了生产。（编者按：现在牛还是农业生产上的主要动力，要想搞好生产，就要管好耕牛。枣阳县牛工队的办法，值得各地仿效。）
    关于饲养、管理制度主要的有这么几条：第一，牛工的活路都通过牛工队长派，小队长只提出任务，至于具体到那犋牛那天干什么都由牛工队长决定。小队长不直接派牛。第二，对耕牛定期排队检查评比（一般七天一次），看谁喂的好，谁喂的不好，对提了膘的奖，无故降了膘的批评，并限期喂好，到了期限还没有喂好的要扣工分。第三，牛工包括喂、用、积肥三种工分，分别记。喂牛的工分按天记，用牛的工分按定额记，积肥的工分按数量质量记。第四，有生殖能力的母牛都要配种繁殖，对配了种、怀上了孕的要奖，对空怀、无故造成胎牛流产的要罚。繁殖的小牛一年后作价，给饲养员一定比例的奖励。对耕牛的死亡，划分“四赔两不赔”的界线。“四赔”是：因管理不善而致死的赔，因病不报不治而致死的赔，打死累死的赔，丢失了的赔（根据具体情节赔耕牛价值的一部分）。“两不赔”是：老死的不赔；有病及时报告，经过治疗无效而死的不赔。第五，根据活路的轻重，把活路分为三等，根据牛的大小、强弱，把牛也分为三等，大牛做重活，小牛做轻活，因牛派活，牛活对口。第六，有关牛工活路的工具（如犁、耙、牛车等等），分别情况由牛工队统一保管或由饲养员分户保管。
    这个小队最近一年来在耕牛管理方面有这么大的成绩，除了制度外，牛工队长檀恕生起了重大的作用。他九岁起就给地主放牛，前后当过二十几年长工，农业生产的活路样样内行，对养牛用牛更是拿手。尤其可贵的是，他有高度的责任心，对公共利益无比的关心，对耕牛无比的爱护。他对全小队二十几头牛的脾气、特点都摸得一清二楚。那头牛适合做什么，应该怎么喂养，什么时候应该休息，他都安排得妥妥贴贴。那头牛有病，他能及时发现，并亲自给牛治病，亲自照料病牛，直到病好为止。每天早、晚他都到田头地边去转，那块田该犁该耙了，他都及时向小队长提出建议，作好安排。有时一部分耕牛需要出外搞运输、搞协作，他要跟去，但又怕家里没人管；不跟去，又怕外边出事。为了解决这个问题，他培养了几个助手，耕牛要去外地时，几个人就分开来，有的管外边的事，有的管家里的事。
    这个小队的队长是一个部队转业下来的同志，工作积极能干，虽然对生产不很内行，但是他善于依靠群众，尤其是能够充分发挥牛工队长檀恕生的作用。牛工的活路，他都是通过檀恕生去具体安排，对檀恕生提出的有关喂牛、管牛、用牛和其他生产方面一切好的建议，无不虚心采纳。这样，檀恕生也就越干越起劲，成了他一个极得力的助手。依靠党的领导，依靠像檀恕生这样一些助手，放手发挥他们的作用，这就保证了他能够把全小队的工作领导好。
    这三个小队各有所长，各有所短。我们感到，如果把它们的经验集中起来，取长补短，就可以成为生产小队工作的一套比较完整的方法了。一个小队，如果有邓家店中店小队那样一个健全的队委会和集体领导、分工负责的制度，有那样一套田间工作的责任制度，有那么一批密切联系群众的“虎将”；有三里庙小队那样一个“后勤部”；有檀家湾小队那样一个牛工队，那样一套管理耕牛的办法，那么，生产、生活就没有搞不好的道理。
    我们还感到，要改进小队的工作方法，必须同时改进生产队以上各级领导的工作方法。生产队是基本核算单位，生产、生活都由它统一安排部署，如果生产队的工作没有头绪，乱抓一气，小队的工作是不可能搞好的。这三个小队的工作之所以搞的比较好，是与生产队的领导分不开的。金星第一生产队、中苏生产队、国光生产队都是比较先进的生产队，它们所属的各个小队的工作都是比较好的。这三个小队又都是生产队的重点小队，生产队的党支部书记经常住在这些小队，具体地帮助小队的同志安排工作，进行工作。同时他们在这里取得经验后，就及时在全生产队推广，点面结合，以点带面，这就把整个生产队的工作都带动起来了。
    我们大多数生产小队的干部都是忠诚、聪明、能干的人，群众中有的是对社会主义事业忠心耿耿的“猛将”和“谋士”。我们想，只要各级领导同志深入下去，发现他们，帮助他们，放手发挥他们的作用，那么，每一个小队都会是“猛将如云，谋士如雨”，在各种工作中，都会战无不胜，攻无不克。
