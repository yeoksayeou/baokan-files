Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, July 18th:

    U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank, who is currently visiting West Germany, held a secret meeting with West German Defense Minister Strauss in Bonn this morning.

    The West German side participating in the meeting included West German Defense Ministry State Secretary Hoff, West German Armed Forces Inspector General and former Hitler General Heusinger, and Navy Inspector General Ruge, among others.

    According to newspapers, the central issue of the meeting was: how the United States can help West Germany get rid of the arms limitations imposed by the Paris Agreement and the Brussels Treaty, so that it can build nuclear submarines up to 1,000 tons and destroyers of 5,000 tons capable of launching nuclear missiles. West Germany also requested that its navy be equipped with U.S. intermediate-range missiles.

    Frank also spoke separately with West German Navy Inspector General Ruge about the situation in the Baltic Sea. They also discussed the US Navy's assistance to the West German Navy in training, supplying the West German Navy with new types of amphibious vehicles and supply ships, etc.

    Commenting on Frank's visit, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" pointed out that the United States has decided to give West Germany huge military "aid." West Germany is preparing to expand its current marine corps into three with the help of the United States. The newspaper also reported that the sixth destroyer supplied by the United States for "training" purposes had been officially handed over to the West German Navy a few weeks ago.

    美国策划扩充西德海军
    新华社波恩18日电　正在西德访问的美国海军部长弗兰克今天上午在波恩和西德国防部长施特劳斯举行了秘密会谈。
    西德方面参加这次会谈的有西德国防部国务秘书霍夫，西德军队总监、前希特勒将军豪辛格和海军总监鲁格等人。
    据报纸透露，这次会谈的中心问题是：美国如何帮助西德摆脱巴黎协定和布鲁塞尔条约对它的军备限制，而使它能够建造达一千吨的核潜艇和能发射核导弹的五千吨的驱逐舰。西德还要求用美国中程导弹来装备它的海军。
    弗兰克还单独同西德海军总监鲁格谈到了波罗的海的形势问题。他们还就美国海军帮助西德海军进行训练、供应西德海军新型的水陆两用交通工具及辎重船等，进行了交谈。
    “法兰克福汇报”在评论弗兰克的这次访问时指出，美国决定给西德巨大的军事“援助”。西德准备在美国的帮助下把目前的一个海军陆战队扩建为三个。这家报纸还报道说，美国供给西德作“训练”使用的第六艘驱逐舰，已经在几个星期前正式交给西德海军。
