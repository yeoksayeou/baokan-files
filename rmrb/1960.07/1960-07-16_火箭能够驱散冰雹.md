    Rockets Can Disperse Hail
    Soviet scientists have successfully used rockets to disperse hail, which is extremely harmful to crops. This was reported in a recent news item in the Soviet magazine "USSR."
    The news item said that Georgia in the Soviet Union is rich in grapes. However, whenever the grapes are harvested in the autumn, they are often attacked by hail, which greatly reduces the harvest. Scientists have experimented with spreading silver iodide powder into the clouds, which can cause water vapor to quickly condense into tiny ice crystals, forming snowflakes, and turning into raindrops when they fall to the ground and encounter warm air. However, in solving the problem of spreading silver iodide powder into the clouds, scientists had carried out various experiments but none of them were effective, because the silver iodide could not be dispersed in time.
    Now, scientists have successfully tested the method of launching specially made rockets at the clouds as they approach the valley from the mountains, releasing substances that cause water vapor to condense rapidly. This will dissipate the clouds and prevent hail from forming.

    火箭能够驱散冰雹
    苏联科学家用火箭来驱散对农作物极为有害的冰雹，已经成功。这是苏联最近出版的“苏联”画报在一则消息中报道的。
    这条消息说，苏联格鲁吉亚盛产葡萄。但是，每当秋季葡萄丰收的时候，经常遭到冰雹的袭击，使收获量大减。科学家曾经试验用碘化银粉末撒进云雾中，能使水气迅速凝结成微小的冰晶体，形成雪花，并且在向地面降落时遇到温暖的空气而化成雨点。但是，在解决把碘化银粉末撒进云雾的问题时，科学家曾作过种种试验但都没有取得效果，因为不能及时地把碘化银散发出去。
  现在，科学家试验成功的是，当山中的云雾向山谷接近的时候，就向它发射特制的火箭，散发使水气迅速凝结的物质。这样就能使云雾消散，不致形成冰雹。
