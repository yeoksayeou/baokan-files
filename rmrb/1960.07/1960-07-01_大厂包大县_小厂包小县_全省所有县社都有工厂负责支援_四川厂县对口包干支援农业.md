Large Factories Support Large Counties, Small Factories Support Small Counties: All Counties and Communes in the Province are Supported by Factories
Sichuan Implements Factory-County Contract System to Support Agriculture
Help Counties and Communes Establish Factories, Train Technical Personnel, Repair Agricultural Machinery, Save Labor, and Support Rural Areas

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th – Sichuan Province has adopted a factory-county contract system, with large factories supporting large counties, medium factories supporting medium-sized counties, and small factories supporting small counties, to support agriculture, bringing the mass movement of industry supporting agriculture into a new stage. More than 4,600 factories and industrial schools across the province have signed long-term contracts with counties (communes) to support agricultural technological transformation, promoting the accelerated realization of agricultural modernization.

The factory-county (commune) contract system in Sichuan Province to support agriculture has developed on the basis of factory-commune pairing. According to incomplete statistics from sixteen special districts and cities, by the first quarter of this year, more than 50% of county-level and above enterprises in the province had paired up with more than 2,000 people's communes, assisting various localities in establishing more than 22,000 factories for agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides, and training nearly 100,000 technical personnel. Since April, factories and mines in various regions have followed the principle of large factories with about 10,000 people supporting large counties, medium factories with 5,000 to 10,000 people supporting medium-sized counties, factories with 1,000 to 5,000 people supporting small counties, and small factories with several hundred people and "small-scale modern groups" enterprises jointly supporting people's communes. Taking large factories with stronger machinery manufacturing capabilities as the mainstay, they have united several factories to form a complete set of forces to support agriculture, and absorbed industrial schools to participate, encompassing all counties and communes in the province. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, they vigorously support agriculture in the following aspects: (1) Helping counties (communes) establish factories for agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.; (2) Training technical personnel for county (commune) industries; (3) Allocating some surplus raw materials, materials, and leftover scraps to support county (commune) industries; (4) Repairing, installing, and manufacturing some urgently needed agricultural machinery for the counties (communes) they support; (5) Saving labor to support rural areas; (6) Both factory and county negotiate to support other needs in agriculture.

After signing the factory-county counterpart contracts, industrial departments first focused on equipping the county (commune) with various agricultural machinery factories, rapidly expanding the manufacturing, repair, and assembly capabilities of rural machinery industries. Since the second quarter, factories in Chengdu alone have supplied more than 40,000 units (pieces) of various machine tools, electric motors, irrigation and drainage machinery, tools, and parts to counties and people's communes through clearing warehouses, allocating surplus equipment, and rushing to produce them. Under the leadership of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee, factories in Chengdu also organized working groups, led by factory leaders, to investigate and understand the situation in the twenty-six counties and suburban areas of Chengdu they supported, and helped each county formulate specific plans and measures for agricultural technological transformation. After signing a contract with Jianyang County to support agriculture, Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has begun to establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair system from the county and district down to the commune for the county, transforming iron and steel plants and cement plants, and expanding power plants to meet the needs of agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization. At the same time, the factory also decided to rush to produce more than 700 gas generators for Jianyang County before the third quarter of this year, so that the county can achieve semi-mechanization of canteens, pig raising, water lifting, processing, and transportation ahead of schedule, so that the county can save more than 36,000 laborers this year. To strengthen the leadership of industry in supporting agriculture, Party committees at all levels above the county level have now established special agencies to support agriculture, led by the secretaries of Party committees at all levels. The Party committees of factories and mines are also responsible for this work by a secretary, and the task of supporting agriculture, together with the production plan, is issued to workshops, sections, and teams at the same time to ensure completion on time, with quality, and in quantity.

    大厂包大县　小厂包小县　全省所有县社都有工厂负责支援
    四川厂县对口包干支援农业
    帮助县、社建立工厂、培养技术人材，修理农业机械、节约劳动力支援农村
    新华社成都30日电　四川省采取大厂包大县、中厂包中等县、小厂包小县的厂县对口包干办法，支援农业，使工业战线支援农业的群众运动进入了一个新的阶段。全省已经有四千六百多个工厂和工业学校同县（社）签订了长期支援农业技术改造的合同，促进农业现代化的加速实现。
    四川省厂县（社）对口包干支援农业，是在厂社挂钩的基础上发展起来的。据十六个专区和市的不完全统计，到今年第一季度为止，全省县属以上企业，已有50％以上同两千多个人民公社挂钩，协助各地公社兴办了二万二千多个农具、化肥、农药等工厂，培训了近十万名技术人员。从4月份起各地厂矿，又按照一万人左右的大厂包大县、五千人到一万人的中厂包中等县、一千人到五千人的工厂包小县、几百人的小厂和“小洋群”企业联合包人民公社的原则，以机械制造能力较强的大厂为主，联合若干工厂把支援农业的力量配套成龙，并吸收工业学校参加，把全省所有县、社都包起来。它们在当地党委统一领导下，从以下几个方面大力支援农业：（1）帮助县（社）建立农业机械、化肥、农药等工厂；（2）为县（社）工业培养技术人材；（3）调剂一部分多余原料、材料和边角废料支援县（社）工业；（4）为所包县（社）修理、安装和制造一部分急需的农业机械；（5）节约劳动力支援农村；（6）厂县双方协议支援农业上的其它需要。
    各地签订厂县对口合同以后，工业部门首先以装备县（社）各种农业机械厂为中心，迅速扩大农村机械工业的制造、修配能力。第二季度以来，仅成都市各工厂通过清理仓库、调剂多余设备和加工赶制等办法，供应县和人民公社的各种机床、电动机、排灌机械和工具、零件等就达四万多台（件）。成都市各工厂在市委领导下，还分别组织工作组，由工厂领导干部率领，到所包二十六个县和成都市郊区调查了解情况，帮助各县制定了农业技术改造的具体规划和措施。成都量具刃具厂同简阳县签订支援农业的合同以后，已经开始为这个县建立从县、区直到公社的农业机械制造修配体系，改造炼铁厂、水泥厂和扩建发电厂，以便满足农业半机械化和机械化需要。这个厂同时还决定在今年第三季度以前，为简阳县赶制七百多台煤气机，使全县提前实现食堂、养猪、提水、加工、运输半机械化，这样全县今年就可节省出三万六千多个劳动力。为加强对工业支援农业的领导，现在县以上各级党委都成立了支援农业的专门机构，由各级党委书记亲自挂帅；各厂矿党委也由一个书记负责专管这一工作，并把支援农业的任务连同生产计划同时下达车间、工段、小组，保证按时、按质、按量完成。
