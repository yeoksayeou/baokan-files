Our Life – Letter from a Worker at the Liuzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory in Guangxi

    Our Cafeteria
    Our factory's Party General Branch抓s the work of the employee cafeteria as tightly as it抓s production. They regularly inspect the quality of the cafeteria's food and the factory's sideline production, and they also require our cafeteria to report the usage of grain, grain reserves, and vegetable supply to the General Branch daily, just like the production departments submit production reports. As soon as the Party General Branch hears any opinions from the employees about the cafeteria, they quickly help us find ways to improve. Once, the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch, Ci Kuanchang, heard workers reflecting that the midday rice was always steamed too soft and didn't taste good. He asked us what the reason was. After we held a meeting to investigate, we quickly improved it.
    Thanks to the Party's concern and education, we all realize the importance of our jobs. Although the cafeteria has few people, in order to make the workers eat better, we still spare manpower to engage in sideline production to improve life. We raise a lot of pigs, and by the end of the year, we can reach seven hundred. We and the employees have planted more than two hundred mu of vegetables, and also raised a lot of cattle, chickens, and ducks.
    Now the employees in the factory are very happy to see us and say: You have really encouraged us!

    我们的食堂
    我们工厂的党总支，抓职工食堂工作就像抓生产一样抓得紧。他们经常检查食堂的饭菜质量和工厂副业生产情况，还要我们食堂像生产部门送生产报表一样，每天把用粮、存粮和蔬菜供应情况向总支作汇报。党总支只要一听到职工对食堂有什么意见，就赶快帮助我们想法改进。有一次总支副书记朿宽昌听工人们反映：中午饭总是蒸得太烂，味道不香。他问我们是什么原因。我们开会一研究，很快就改进了。
    由于党的关怀和教育，我们都认识到自己工作岗位的重要性。食堂虽然人手少，但是要使工人吃得更好，我们还是腾出人力来搞副业，改善生活。我们养的猪可不少，到年底可以达到七百头。我们和职工们一共种了二百多亩蔬菜，还养了不少牛、鸡、鸭。
    现在厂里的职工们一看到我们就非常高兴地说：你们真是给我们鼓了劲啦！
