Xinhua News Agency, July 27th dispatch from Leopoldville: The Congolese military and civilians' anti-colonialist patriotic and righteous struggle continues to unfold in various locations. On the 25th, in Tshikapa, a diamond mining industrial center south of Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province, local tribal people joined the struggle to defend their independent sovereignty, rising up to oppose the provocations of the Belgian colonialists. The Belgian authorities immediately airdropped eighty paratroopers there to suppress the population. It is reported that the Belgian army has already seized the airport and urban area.

In Luluabourg, some Congolese soldiers continue to fight back against the colonialists.

In Bukavu, Goma, Kindu, and Kasongo in Kivu Province, the anti-colonialist struggle is also unfolding. Congolese soldiers are leaving their barracks to search colonialist vehicles.

At the same time, news continues to spread that Congolese soldiers are refusing to lay down their weapons to the UN forces. Following the Congolese soldiers in Stanleyville and a portion of the Congolese soldiers in Matadi port, a portion of the Congolese soldiers in Luluabourg are also refusing to hand over their weapons to the UN forces. According to Agence France-Presse, when a UN force occupied Luluabourg on the 24th and began to "take over" the positions held by the Congolese soldiers, approximately three hundred Congolese soldiers refused to lay down their arms, taking their mortars and moving into the countryside. The report states that the UN forces are sending massive reinforcements there.

Meanwhile, the Belgian aggressor troops continue to occupy many places in the Congo. According to Belgian Defense Minister Gilson in Brussels on the 25th, the Belgian army still controls twenty-five areas in the Congo, and only in Leopoldville has it been replaced by UN forces. Gilson also told a newspaper reporter that there are a total of 10,000 Belgian troops in the Congo, including the Air Force, Army, and Navy.

In the areas occupied by the Belgian aggressor troops, the Congolese people are being subjected to cruel massacres. According to a telegram sent to Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba by some members of the opposition party (Balubakat Party) in the Katanga Provincial Assembly, hundreds of Baluba people have already been killed by the Belgian aggressor troops in Katanga Province. The telegram demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Belgian colonial army from the province, and expressed opposition to the imperialist plot to split Katanga Province from the Congo.

    刚果军民英勇不屈坚持斗争
    路路阿堡士兵拒绝向联合国军放下武器
    比利时侵略军赖在很多地区不走并残杀刚果人民
    新华社27日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民掀起的反殖民主义爱国正义斗争继续在各地开展。25日，在开赛省首府路路阿堡以南的金刚钻开采工业中心契卡帕，当地部族人民投入了保卫独立主权的斗争，群起反对比利时殖民者的挑衅。比利时当局立即在那里空投了八十名伞兵进行镇压，据报道，比利时军队已经侵占了那里的机场和城区。
    在路路阿堡，一些刚果士兵继续在反击殖民者。
    在基伍省的布卡武、果马、金杜和卡松果等地，反殖民主义斗争也在展开，刚果士兵纷纷走出兵营，搜查殖民者的车辆。
    在这同时，刚果士兵拒绝向联合国军放下武器的消息不断传出。继斯坦利维尔的刚果士兵和马塔迪港的一部分刚果士兵之后，路路阿堡的一部分刚果士兵也拒绝向联合国军交出武器。据法新社报道，当一支联合国军24日占领路路阿堡，并开始“接管”刚果士兵坚守的阵地时，约三百名刚果士兵拒绝放下武器，带了迫击炮转入农村，消息说，联合国军正向那里大量增援。
    同时，比利时侵略军继续占领着刚果许多地方。据比利时国防大臣纪耳松25日在布鲁塞尔透露，比利时军队仍然控制着刚果的二十五个地区，只是在利奥波德维尔一地已由联合国军队接替。纪耳松还对一家报纸的记者说，在刚果的比利时军队共计有一万人，包括空军、陆军和海军。
    在比利时侵略军占领的地方，刚果人民遭到残酷的屠杀。据加丹加省省议会反对党（巴卢巴卡特党）的一些议员在给刚果总理卢蒙巴的电报中揭露说，在加丹加省，已有好几百名巴卢巴人被比利时侵略军所杀害。电报要求使比利时殖民军立即撤出该省，并且表示反对帝国主义者策划把加丹加省从刚果分裂出去的阴谋。
