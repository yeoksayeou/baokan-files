Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 1st: The Indian News Service reported that 100,000 employees of the central government system in Calcutta held a mass meeting on June 29th, reiterating their demands for improved living conditions. The employees held banners and flags and marched in demonstrations on the streets of Calcutta.

The news agency said that those who spoke at the meeting made it clear that in the face of the Indian government's decree prohibiting strikes and the threat of possible large-scale arrests, government employees will insist on not canceling their decision that has already been made. They demanded that the government avoid using the army as accomplices in undermining the strike during the strike period.

As previously reported, the "Joint Action Committee," representing 2.2 million workers in railways, post and telecommunications, government agencies and other institutions affiliated to the Indian central government, has decided to hold a strike starting on July 11th.

According to the "Hindustan Times," 400,000 central government employees in Calcutta have already decided to go on strike.

Yesterday's "Indian Express" said that 21,000 Calcutta dockworkers and non-government employees are also preparing to strike at the same time as central government employees on July 11th.

In this planned strike, only the Indian National Trade Union Congress led by the Congress Party opposes the strike, while all other parties and non-partisan trade unions unanimously advocate holding a strike.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 1st: The Indian Press Trust reported that a complete strike and market closure took place yesterday in the industrial town of Faridabad, near Delhi, to protest the police's suppression of demonstrating refugees on the 29th by opening fire.

According to "The Times of India," thousands of people paraded through the town yesterday morning, carrying black flags and shouting slogans against the police. Workers left all the factories, and students refused to go to school. Not a cup of tea or a piece of ice could be bought in the entire town.

A recent report in the "Indian Express" stated that thousands of refugees went to the Faridabad crematorium yesterday to cremate the bodies of the three people shot dead by the police. A long line followed behind those carrying the bodies to the crematorium. People unanimously passed a resolution at the crematorium, condemning the police for opening fire and demanding a fair investigation into the incident.

The police shooting incident occurred on the 29th. On that day, 3,000 refugees in Faridabad, who had moved in from Pakistan since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, held a strike and demonstration to oppose the Indian government's decision to auction off houses leased by industrial workers relocated to the town by the Rehabilitation Department. The police suppressed the demonstrators by opening fire, killing four people and injuring fifteen.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 29th: According to the Indian Press Trust, more than 12,000 textile workers in five textile factories in Solapur, Maharashtra State, held a symbolic strike yesterday to protest the management's failure to implement the recommendations of the Textile Industry Wage Committee. The report said that the workers held a demonstration parade on the streets of the city.

New Delhi newspapers reported on the 25th: More than 40,000 textile workers in Madras State and Delhi have also decided to go on strike in July, after long-term negotiations with textile factory owners failed, demanding wage increases.

According to the Indian Press Trust, the six-day strike by sailors of the Bombay Port Trust fleet ended victoriously on the 28th. Their demand to reinstate the jobs of six suspended workers has been accepted.
