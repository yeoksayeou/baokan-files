    Moscow Ring Road
    More than forty roads converge on Moscow from all directions. Every day, tens of thousands of trucks pass through Moscow on their way to various destinations. As a result, the number of vehicles passing through Moscow's main streets is very large. To change this situation, construction of the Moscow Ring Road began several years ago.
    Kubasov, the manager of the highway construction company, said: "The construction of the ring road is a first in the Soviet Union. It surrounds Moscow like a lock ring, allowing all roads leading to the capital to be connected to this transportation line."
    The ring road is paved with concrete, and there is a four-meter wide green belt in the center of the road. Overpasses are built where it intersects with railways. There is no need for traffic lights here. Because the road surface is paved with concrete and there are no intersections on the road, vehicles can travel at maximum speed.
    The Moscow Ring Road is 109 kilometers long, and the construction project is divided into two phases. The first phase of the project—the eastern half of the ring road, which is 47 kilometers long—will be completed this year. This section of the line passes through the Yaroslavl, Gorky, and Ryazan highways, and it also passes through the Novo-Ryazan, Kashira, and Podolsk highways that are under construction. The roadbed of this ring road has been completely paved, and bridges and overpasses have also been built. Concrete has been laid on a long section of the roadbed. Now, the highways from Gorky to Novo-Ryazan and from Kashira to Podolsk are open to traffic.
    The second phase of the project—the western half of the ring road—will be completed and put into use in 1962. After this section of the road is open to traffic, all trucks can bypass Moscow's main streets, and the tension of urban transportation will be greatly alleviated. For example, it will be more convenient for vehicles traveling from the western suburbs of Moscow to the eastern suburbs to travel on the ring road. It only takes twenty to twenty-five minutes to bypass Moscow from Podolsk to Yaroslavl.
    The builders of the ring road will complete a total of more than 7 million cubic meters of earthwork; lay more than 500,000 cubic meters of concrete; renovate all power lines, culverts, and water pipes; and build three new large bridges over the Moscow River and canals, as well as fifty-eight overpasses at highway and railway intersections.
    All road construction projects adopt the latest scientific and technological achievements. For example, the spanning structures of overpasses were previously composed of entire girder frames weighing 40 metric tons. Now, they are composed of prefabricated components weighing 3.5 to 5 metric tons. Prefabricated component skeletons made of steel bars are installed in series at intervals.
    The road surface is paved with pre-stressed reinforced concrete, which will greatly extend the service life of the highway.

### 莫斯科环城公路

    莫斯科环城公路
    四十多条公路，从四面八方向莫斯科汇集。每天，有几万辆货车经过莫斯科驶往各地。因此，莫斯科主要街道通过的车辆数量很大。为了改变这种情况，莫斯科环城公路在几年前就动工兴建了。
    公路建筑公司经理库巴索夫说：“建筑环城公路，在苏联还是第一次。它像锁环一样围绕着莫斯科，让所有通首都的公路都和这个交通线连结起来。”
    环城公路是用混凝土铺的，公路中央有四米宽的绿化地带，它和铁道交叉的地方建有跨线桥。这里，不需要交通信号灯。因为路面是混凝土铺的，公路线上的交叉点也没有了，于是车辆就能够用最大的速度行驶。
    莫斯科环城公路长一百零九公里，建设工程分两期施工。第一期工程——东半圈环城公路长四十七公里，今年可以建成。这段线路穿过雅罗斯拉夫尔、高尔基和梁赞三条公路，它还穿过正在建筑的诺沃梁赞、卡希拉和波多尔斯三条公路。这条环城公路的路基已经全部铺好，桥梁和跨线桥也已建成，在很长的一段路基上铺上了混凝土。现在，从高尔基到诺沃梁赞和卡希拉到波多尔斯克的公路已经通车。
    第二期工程——西半圈环城公路将在1962年建成并交付使用。这段公路通车以后，所有的货车可以绕过莫斯科的主要街道，市内交通运输的紧张程度就会大大缓和下来。例如，车辆从莫斯科的西郊驶往东郊，在环城公路上行驶会更方便一些。从波多尔斯到雅罗斯拉夫尔，只花二十分钟到二十五分钟就绕过了莫斯科。
    环城公路的建设者总共要完成七百多万立方米的土方工程；铺设五十多万立方米的混凝土；要改建全部输电线、道管和水管；在莫斯科河和运河上需要新建三座大桥、五十八座公路和铁路交叉处的跨线桥。
    全部筑路工程采用最新的科学技术成就。例如，跨线桥的跨空结构，以前是用重四十公吨的整座梁架组成的。现在，改为用三公吨半到五公吨的预制部件组成。用钢筋制成的预制部件骨架，成串地安装在间距上。
    路面采用预加应力的钢筋混凝土来铺设，这就会大大地延长公路的使用期限。
