How We Combine Technical Revolution and Studying Mao Zedong's Works
中共沙市市委员会

    The technical revolution is a great revolutionary struggle. It is an acute ideological struggle, and also a struggle between man and nature. Leading the technical revolution is like fighting a war. In revolutionary war, we fought according to Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating superior forces to eliminate the enemy's effective strength, defeating the enemy one battle at a time, and winning great victories. Now, in the technical revolution movement, we must also act according to Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on the main contradictions at different stages, setting clear goals, and seizing victory step by step. In Shashi, from November 1959, we began to use the method of "key problem assault battles" to organize the city's technical revolution movement. Taking the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the key link, we closely combined ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution, forming a new high tide of a revolutionary mass movement on an unprecedented scale. Now the city has fought seven battles and is fighting the eighth.

    The technical revolution is first and foremost a great revolution in thought. The broad masses urgently demand high-speed socialist construction. Before the first battle, over 70% of the city's workers were engaged in heavy manual labor and manual operations, and labor productivity was very low. If this backward state was not changed, continuous leaps forward could not be realized. However, some people were afraid of "change," afraid of "chaos," and some even said, "Small changes cause small chaos, big changes cause big chaos, and the more you change, the more chaotic it becomes." In this situation, we studied Chairman Mao's idea of "poverty gives rise to the desire for change," and organized leading cadres and workers at all levels to visit and learn from Zaoyang and other places that were changing rapidly and well three times. After returning, we gave reports everywhere, talked about the situation, and discussed Gong Tongwen's "Change" and "Visit Notes" and other articles. We also launched a city-wide movement to discuss "change" under the theme of "Zaoyang is changing, the whole country is changing, will Shashi change? Can it change? Will it be a big change or a small change? Who will we rely on to change?" As a result, factories, agencies, streets, and alleys were filled with talk of "change," people's thinking changed, and the atmosphere in the city changed accordingly. On this ideological basis, the plan for the first battle, focusing on eliminating heavy manual labor, quickly turned into practical action by the masses. After five days of preparation, the original seven-day battle task was completed in just five days. Two hundred and eighty-one processes of heavy manual labor in the city were mechanized and semi-mechanized, unveiling the prelude to a large-scale mass movement of technical revolution. They said change, and it really began to change!

    However, many people still clung to old habits and old technologies, taking a skeptical and indifferent attitude towards new things. A few people even openly poured cold water on new things. There is such a story: Fang Lieying, an innovator at a knitting factory, was a young female machine operator in the sewing tip group. For more than a year, she had continuously innovated technology, enduring ridicule and blows. All kinds of "cold water" such as "lazy," "playful," "showing off," and "creating a妖风 (demonic wind)" were poured on Fang Lieying. The deputy factory director and the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, who had serious right-leaning ideas, also said that Fang Lieying's innovation "affected production and was divorced from the masses." Fang Lieying applied to join the League five times, but was not approved. Fang Lieying still insisted on innovation, and finally, with the support of the Party branch, realized the "four automatics" of the sewing tip machine. This story gave us great inspiration, and we immediately launched a "Learn from Fang Lieying" movement in the city. At the same time, we compiled and printed relevant expositions in Chairman Mao's works on the attitude towards new things and distributed them to cadres and workers for study and discussion. Within a few days, more than 1,800 study groups were established in the city, with more than 20,000 people participating in the study, forming a large-scale mass movement to study Mao Zedong Thought. Innovators became more determined, waverers stopped wavering, and people who did not support innovation also began to change. Workers said: "After studying Chairman Mao's works, it's like a lamp has been lit in my heart, bright and clear, and when I work, I'm full of energy!" Yang Yufu, a painter at the Shashi Factory, had never been enthusiastic about technical innovation. When young workers developed a spray painting machine, he didn't even look at it, complaining about its poor quality. After studying, he examined himself and said: "Now I've got it, new things always have shortcomings, the quality of the spray painting machine is not good, it can be improved. Wouldn't it be many times better than manual labor if it was improved?" So he went everywhere to find materials and took the initiative to study with the young workers, and finally made a spray painting machine as a gift for studying Chairman Mao's works. After studying Chairman Mao's ideas on how to treat new things, a situation emerged in the city where everyone participated in innovation and everyone supported innovation, forming a strong technical revolution team, which made it possible for us to basically eliminate manual operations in the second and third battles.

    At the end of the third battle, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city rose from 28.2% to 60%. Some cadres and workers thought that "it's almost there," that "getting rid of manual tools is earth-shattering, and if we innovate again, there's nothing to innovate," and that "if we want to innovate again, we can only buy foreign machines." In response to these ideological situations, we organized the study of Chairman Mao's idea of continuous revolution throughout the city, using the Liu Qianwang group of the underwear workshop of the dyeing and finishing factory as a model of continuous revolution. This group had carried out seven technical innovations in succession over the past two years. Production operations had changed from using poles to pry dye to hand-cranking and foot-pedaling, and then to electric power, which seemed to have reached the top. However, in this study, they criticized the "almost there" mentality and continued to innovate. They used the existing equipment of the dyeing and finishing workshop to connect the boiling, washing, bleaching, and dyeing processes into the city's first automatic production line, completely replacing all the work of the original underwear workshop. A flatbed machine that workers had just made in the third battle and were preparing to install in the underwear workshop was sent to the "farewell to old technology" exhibition before it was even used. Workers throughout the city studied Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the spirit of the Liu Qianwang group, eliminating complacency and moving the movement in the direction of linkage lines and automatic lines. In the fourth battle, a total of fifty-two automatic lines and linkage lines and eighty assembly lines appeared in the city, and at the same time, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization was also improved.

    The great leap forward in the fourth battle put forward the requirements of forming a complete set and consolidating and improving for the fifth and sixth battles. At this time, new contradictions and difficulties arose. The main ones were: some equipment did not pass the technical barrier, the supply of raw materials was insufficient, the workers' technical level could not keep up with the development of the technical revolution, and some units were stagnant. In this situation, should we retreat in the face of difficulties and wait passively, or should we forge ahead in the face of difficulties and rely on our own efforts? At this time, the whole Party and the whole people studied the spirit of the "poor stick cooperative" praised by Chairman Mao, and solved this problem. At the same time, we found the city's poor stick cooperative - the Shashi Tire Factory. This factory was started from scratch by three shoemakers from the Martyrs' Families Shoe Factory: Qiu Yulong, Shen Bingcai, and Liu Shusheng. Their purpose in running this factory was to use the factory's waste materials to create more wealth for the country. In order to run this factory, they gave up their original craftsmanship, voluntarily requested to lower their wages, endured the ridicule of backward elements, and experienced countless difficulties. They started with two knives, a hammer, and a pile of waste rubber, making their own equipment, finding their own raw materials, and studying technology on their own. In two years, they established a rubber products factory that can produce transmission belts, high-pressure water pipes, tires, and more than ten other products in batches, and basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the production process, and also trained a group of technical workers. The story of Qiu Yulong and others running the factory gave the cadres and workers of the city a great education, helping everyone to more deeply understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions on the "poor stick cooperative." People who used to call it difficult no longer did, and things that were thought to be impossible to do were now done. A female worker named Tian Daoxiu in the Plastics Chemical Factory had previously proposed a suggestion for innovating a sieve buckle machine, but at the same time, she requested raw materials, manpower, and time. Because she did not do it herself, these three conditions were never met, and her suggestion was not implemented for more than a year. After this study, she said: "We just lack this kind of poor stick spirit!" So she immediately found materials herself, used waste canvas instead of iron sheet, and worked together with twenty-one female workers in her workshop. In a few days, they made the sieve buckle machine that had not been made for more than a year. She said: "Once the ideological problem is solved, everything is easy to solve." In this way, we successfully completed the tasks proposed by the fifth and sixth battles, and prepared for the seventh battle to carry out comprehensive utilization and raw material production, and to advance towards high-precision, cutting-edge new products.

    The study of "poverty gives rise to the desire for change," "correctly treat new things," "the theory of continuous revolution," and "the spirit of the poor stick cooperative" for the powerful forces generated in the various battles of the technical revolution has made leading cadres and the broad masses further recognize the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought. If you learn it, you use it; if you learn it, it works; the more you learn, the more interesting it becomes; the more you learn, the more useful it becomes; the more you learn, the more you want to learn. After studying, people's thinking became clear, and the methods were also correct. With the development of the technical revolution, the demand for studying Mao Zedong Thought became more urgent. For this reason, we also launched the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" among cadres and the masses. Many workers learned to summarize experience from practice, learned to analyze contradictions and solve contradictions, and immediately applied them to production and life. The Chen Quanying group in the fine yarn workshop of the yarn factory used low-grade cotton to spin high-grade yarn, opening large flowers, and the work was not easy to do. The machine operators spent all their time piecing yarn together when they were on duty, and had no time to clean. The doffers helped with cleaning, but they could not get out of the alley, but the number of yarn breakages increased. After studying "On Contradiction," they understood the principle of grasping the main contradiction. Everyone believed that in the past, rushing to piece the yarn together and neglecting the cleaning of the leather roller meant that they had not grasped the main contradiction. As a result, poor cleaning actually increased the number of yarn breakages. They changed their minds and concentrated their efforts on cleaning the leather roller, the main contradiction. They would rather sacrifice a few yarn breakages than clean first. As a result, the cleaning work was done well, the yarn breakages were reduced, the labor was greatly reduced, and the output value was increased. They said: "After studying Mao Zedong Thought, not only is our courage greater, but our minds are also more flexible!"

    The further development of the technical revolution movement has put forward higher requirements for the cultural revolution, and at the same time promoted a closer combination of ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution. As early as the fourth battle, more than a thousand scientific and technological research groups appeared in the city. These groups have gradually developed into the current groups that combine theoretical study, scientific research, and tackling key problems. The Yellow Phosphorus Group of the Pesticide Factory and the Xiang Xiuli Group of the Meat, Food, Egg, and Poultry Store are representatives of such groups. The members of the Yellow Phosphorus Group are seven young people with an average age of less than twenty years old, and the highest level of education is only junior high school. Their activity formula in the battle to tackle the key problems of refining yellow phosphorus is: tackling key problems - encountering difficulties - studying Mao Zedong Thought, inspiring fighting spirit, clarifying the direction - conducting scientific and technical learning, studying methods - tackling key problems again. Using this method, they spent only a little over a month to master the technology, combining foreign principles and indigenous methods, and refined yellow phosphorus, which many units had not been able to refine successfully, with self-made earthen electric furnaces and large water tanks, launching the first shot of Shashi workers marching towards new technologies, new experiences, and new processes. The three young women of the Xiang Xiuli Group used the same method and completely successfully trial-produced a variety of high-grade drugs such as insulin and cystamine using indigenous methods. The form of the Yellow Phosphorus Group and the Xiang Xiuli Group closely combining the three revolutions of thought, technology, and culture is the grass-roots combat organization in our key problem assault battles in the technical revolution movement, and will also be a concrete path for the intellectualization of the working class.

    Another good form is the Red and Expert School, which combines political, technical, and cultural learning. The Iron and Wood Farm Implement Factory has a Red and Expert School. In the past, it was closed-door teaching, teaching according to the textbook. As a result, the factory had to ask people not to be absent from class by deducting wages for absenteeism. But after they adopted a teaching method that closely linked theory with practice, the situation changed. Whatever the factory did, the school learned, learning and doing, learning and using. The people who taught were more interested, and the people who learned were even more interested. This kind of Red and Expert School, under the unified leadership of the Party organization, closely combined with the central work, studying politics, technology, and culture, will play an increasingly significant role in strengthening the link between theory and practice, in the intellectualization of the working class, and in the close combination of ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution.

    我们是怎样把技术革命和学习毛泽东著作结合起来的
    中共沙市市委员会
    技术革命是伟大的革命斗争。是尖锐的思想斗争，又是人和自然界的斗争。领导技术革命如同打仗。在革命战争中，我们按照毛泽东思想打仗，集中优势兵力消灭敌人的有生力量，一个战役一个战役地打败了敌人，获得了伟大的胜利；如今在技术革命运动中，我们也必须按照毛泽东思想办事，针对各个时期不同的主要矛盾，提出明确的目标，一步一步地夺取胜利。就沙市来说，从1959年11月起，我们开始用攻关战役的方法来组织全市的技术革命运动，以学习毛泽东思想为纲，将思想革命、技术革命、文化革命紧密地结合在一起，形成了空前规模的革命的群众运动的新高潮。现在全市已经打了七个战役，正在打第八个战役。
    技术革命首先是一场思想上的大革命。广大群众迫切要求高速度地进行社会主义建设，而在第一次战役之前，全市有70％以上的工人从事笨重体力劳动和手工操作，劳动生产率很低，如果不改变这种落后面貌，就不能实现持续跃进。可是有些人怕“变”，怕“乱”，甚至有人说“小变小乱、大变大乱、越变越乱”。在这种情况下，我们学习了毛主席“穷则思变”的思想，组织了各级负责干部和工人三次到变得很快而又变得很好的枣阳等地参观学习。回来后，到处作报告，讲形势，同时讨论龚同文的“变”和“参观记”等文章，并且以“枣阳在变、全国在变，沙市变不变？能不能变？是大变还是小变？依靠谁来变？”为题，开展了全民论“变”的运动。这样一来，工厂机关、街头巷尾，一片谈“变”之声，人们的思想变了，全市的空气也跟着变了。在这个思想基础上，以消灭笨重体力劳动为主的第一战役的计划，迅速地变为群众的实际行动。经过五天的准备，原订七天的战役任务，只用了五天时间就完成了。全市二百八十一道工序的笨重体力劳动实现了机械化和半机械化，揭开了大规模的技术革命的群众运动的序幕。说变，果然就开始变了！
    但是，也有不少人还是抱着旧习惯、旧技术死不放手，对于新事物采取怀疑、冷淡的态度；少数人甚至公开向新事物大泼冷水。有这么一个故事：针织厂革新者方烈英是缝尖组的一个青年女值车工，一年多来，她不断地革新技术，受尽了讽刺打击。什么“偷懒”、“贪玩”、“出风头”、“发妖风”等等“冷水”都往方烈英头上泼。有严重右倾思想的副厂长和团支部书记也说方烈英闹革新“影响生产、脱离群众”。方烈英五次申请入团，都没有被批准。方烈英还是坚持革新，终于在党支部的支持下，实现了缝尖机的“四自动”。这个故事给了我们很大的启发，当即在全市开展了“学习方烈英”的运动，同时，把毛主席著作中有关对待新生事物态度的论述编印成册，发给干部和工人学习讨论。几天之内，全市成立了一千八百多个学习小组，有两万多人参加了学习，形成了一个大规模的学习毛泽东思想的群众运动。革新者更加坚定了，动摇者不再动摇了，不支持革新的人也开始转变了。工人们说：“学了毛主席的著作，心里像点了一盏灯，亮堂堂的，干起活来，浑身是劲！”沙厂油漆工人杨裕富，一向对技术革新不积极，青工搞喷漆机，他看都不看，嫌它质量不好。学习后，他自己检查说：“这一下开窍了，新事物总是有缺点的，喷漆机质量不好可以改进，改好了不是要比手工高多少倍吗？”于是他到处找材料，主动和青工一同研究，终于制成了喷漆机作为学习毛主席著作的献礼。学习了毛主席如何对待新生事物的思想，全市出现了人人参加革新、人人支持革新的局面，形成了强大的技术革命队伍，使我们有可能在第二战役和第三战役基本上取消了手工操作。
    第三战役结束，全市机械化半机械化程度由28.2％上升到了60％。一部分干部和工人认为“差不多了”、“甩掉了手工工具就是翻天复地，再革，没有可革的了”、“要再革就只有买洋机器了”。针对这些思想情况，我们又在全市组织学习毛主席的不断革命的思想，用染整厂内衣车间刘千望小组作为不断革命的榜样。这个小组两年来接连进行了七次技术革新，生产操作由用棍子撬染改为手摇、脚踩，直到电动，似乎已经到了顶。但是他们在这次学习中，批判了“差不多”思想，继续革新。他们利用染整车间的现有设备，把煮、洗、漂、染等工序连成了全市的第一条自动作业线，完全代替了原来内衣车间的全部工作；工人们在第三个战役中刚刚制成、准备安装在内衣车间的一部平板机，还没有用就送进了“向旧技术告别”的“展览会”。全市工人学习毛主席的不断革命论，学习刘千望小组的精神，扫除了自满情绪，使运动向着联动线、自动线的方向发展。在第四个战役中，全市共出现自动线和联动线五十二条、流水线八十条，同时，也提高了机械化半机械化的程度。
    在第四个战役中的大踏步前进，对第五、六个战役提出了成龙配套和巩固提高的要求。这时，新的矛盾和困难产生了。主要是：一部分设备没有过技术关，原材料供应不足，工人的技术水平跟不上技术革命的发展，还有一部分单位停滞不前。在这种情况下，是知难而退、消极等待，还是迎难奋进、自力更生？这时全党全民学习了毛主席表扬过的“穷棒子社”的精神，解决了这个问题。同时，找到了本市的穷棒子社——沙市轮胎厂。这个厂是由烈军属鞋厂的三个鞋匠丘玉龙、沈炳才和刘树生白手起家办起来的。他们办这个厂的目的就是想利用厂里的废料为国家多创造一些财富。为了办这个工厂，他们放弃了本行手艺，自动要求降低工资，忍受落后分子对他们的讽刺，经历了无数困难。他们凭着两把刀子、一把鎯头、一堆废胶起家，自己造设备、自己找原材料、自己钻研技术，两年时间，办起了这座能够成批生产传动带、高压水管、轮胎等十多种产品的橡胶制品厂，并且基本上实现了生产过程的机械化和半机械化，还培养了成批的技术工人。丘玉龙等办厂的故事给了全市干部和工人以极大的教育，帮助大家更加深刻地领会了毛主席对“穷棒子社”批语的精神，原来叫困难的人，现在不叫了，原来以为办不到的事，现在办到了。塑料化工厂一个女工田道秀过去曾经提出过一项革新筛扣机的建议，但同时提出要原材料、要人、要时间，由于她自己没动手，这三个条件一直没有具备，她的建议一年多也没实现。这次学习之后，她说：“我们就缺乏这种穷棒子精神！”于是她马上自己找材料，用废帆布代替了铁皮，并且和本车间二十一个女工一齐动手干，几天工夫，就把隔了一年多没做成的筛扣机做成了。她说：“思想问题一解决，什么问题都好解决了。”正是这样，我们胜利地完成了第五、六次战役所提出的任务，并且为第七个战役大搞综合利用和原材料生产、向高精尖新产品进军作了准备。
      “穷则思变”、“正确对待新生事物”、“不断革命论”、“穷棒子精神”的学习，对于技术革命各个战役所产生的强大力量，使领导干部和广大群众都进一步认识了学习毛泽东思想的重大意义，学了就用，学了就灵，越学越有味，越学越有用，越学越想学。经过学习的人，思想开朗了，方法也对头了，随着技术革命的发展，学习毛泽东思想的要求更加迫切。为此，我们又在干部和群众中开展了《实践论》和《矛盾论》的学习。许多工人学会了从实践中总结经验，学会了分析矛盾解决矛盾的方法，并且马上运用到生产和生活中来。纱厂细纱车间陈全英小组用低级棉花纺高级纱，开大花，活路很不好做，值车工一上班就接头，没有时间做清洁，落纱工帮助做清洁，出不了弄堂，但断头却越接越多。学习《矛盾论》后，她们懂得了要抓主要矛盾的道理，大家认为，过去抢接头放松了皮辊清洁，是没有抓住主要矛盾，结果清洁不好反而影响断头加多。她们改变了主意，集中力量主攻皮辊清洁这个主要矛盾，宁可牺牲几根断头不接，也要先把清洁做好，结果清洁工作做好了，断头也减少了，劳动大大减轻，产量产值都提高了。她们说：“学了毛泽东思想，不但胆子大了，脑子也灵活了！”
    技术革命运动的进一步发展，向文化革命提出了更高的要求，同时也促进了思想革命、技术革命、文化革命更加紧密的结合。早在第四战役中，全市就出现了一千多个科学技术研究小组，这种小组又逐步地发展成为现在的理论学习——科学研究——攻关三结合的小组。农药厂的黄磷小组和肉食蛋禽商店的向秀丽小组就是这种小组的代表。黄磷小组的成员是七个平均年龄不满二十岁的青年，文化程度最高的也只有初中，他们在提炼黄磷的攻关战中的活动公式是：攻关——遇到困难——学习毛泽东思想，鼓舞斗志，明确方向——进行科学技术学习，研究办法——再攻关。采用了这种方法，他们只用了一个多月的时间，就掌握了技术，把洋原理和土办法结合起来，用自造的土电炉和大水缸提炼出了许多单位没有提炼成功的黄磷，打响了沙市工人向新工艺、新技术、新经验进军的第一炮。向秀丽小组的三个女青年运用了同样的方法，完全用土办法试制成功了胰岛素、胱胺酸等多种高级药品。黄磷小组和向秀丽小组把思想、技术、文化三个革命紧密结合的形式，是我们在技术革命运动中的攻关战役的基层战斗组织，也将是工人阶级知识化的一条具体道路。
    还有一种很好的形式就是政治、技术和文化学习三结合的红专学校。铁木农具厂有个红专学校，过去是关门教学，照本宣科，结果只好要求厂里用旷课扣工资的办法来叫人不旷课。而在他们采取了理论密切联系实际的教学方法以后，情况就变了，厂里做什么，学校里就学什么，边做边学，学了就用，教的人兴趣高了，学的人兴趣更高了。这种在党组织统一领导之下，密切结合中心工作，学习政治、技术、文化的红专学校，对于加强理论和实践的联系，对于工人阶级知识化，对于思想革命、技术革命、文化革命的密切结合，将发挥越来越显著的作用。
