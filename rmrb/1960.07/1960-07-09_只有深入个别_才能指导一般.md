    Only by delving into the specific can we guide the general

    Some comrades worry: After organizing a large number of cadres to go deep into the front line of production, will it affect the understanding and grasp of the overall situation, and affect the overall leadership of the entire production? The facts are completely opposite to what these comrades think. Only by delving into the specific can we better guide the general.

    The general and the specific are a dialectical unity. The two are closely linked, and without the specific, there is no general. At the same time, the general exists within the specific. By deeply dissecting one sparrow, you can understand other sparrows. By delving into a production team to help workers strengthen economic accounting, you can summarize the experience and strengthen the leadership of the economic accounting work of other production teams. After delving into a backward production team and directly obtaining experience in transforming backwardness, you can strengthen the leadership of the work of other backward production teams, and you can draw inferences about other cases from one instance and put forward various practical and beneficial opinions on the entire work. Anyone who has a concrete and in-depth understanding of the situation of individual units, and who has concrete experience in solving various individual problems, can better analyze the overall situation and conduct overall leadership. Any leading organ and leading cadre, regardless of the size of its leadership and jurisdiction, and the number of units under its jurisdiction, has a relationship between the general and the specific. In order to carry out universal and correct leadership within the scope of one's work, it is necessary to frequently delve into individual units, carry out various "dissection of sparrows" work, and directly obtain concrete experience. Otherwise, there is a danger of making one's work general and falling into emptiness.

    Of course, emphasizing delving into the specific does not mean separating the specific from the general, and grasping the work of individual units in isolation. Delving into the specific is for the purpose of better guiding the general, and only under the correct guidance of the general can the work of delving into the specific be better done. Therefore, when we delve into a certain "point" and a certain task, we must always pay close attention to studying the overall situation and the progress of the work, pay attention to studying and learning the experiences of other units, and closely link the work of individual units with the entire work. As for which points to focus on, and what problems to grasp, we must also consider this from the perspective of the overall progress of the work, and we must have a clear overall perspective.

### 只有深入个别　才能指导一般

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    只有深入个别　才能指导一般
    有些同志顾虑：组织大批干部深入生产第一线以后，是否会影响对于全面情况的了解和掌握，影响整个生产的全面领导。事实与这些同志所想的完全相反。只有深入了个别，才能更好地指导一般。
    一般与个别是辩证的统一。两者有着密切的联系，离开了个别，也就无所谓一般。同时，在个别当中又存在着一般。深入解剖了一个麻雀，就可以了解其他的麻雀。深入一个生产小组帮助工人加强了经济核算的工作，就可以把经验总结起来，加强对于其他生产小组的经济核算工作的领导。深入一个落后的生产小组，直接取得了改造落后的经验以后，就可以加强对于其他落后生产小组工作的领导，而且可以举一反三，由此及彼，对于整个工作提出各种切实有益的意见。凡是对个别单位的情况了解得具体深入的人，对于解决各种个别问题具有具体经验的人，就能更好地分析全面的情况，进行全面的领导。任何一个领导机关和领导干部，不管其领导和管辖范围的大小，所属的单位多少，都有一个一般和个别的关系问题。要想在自己所属的工作范围以内进行普遍、正确的领导，就必须经常地深入个别单位，进行各种解剖麻雀的工作，直接取得具体的经验。否则，就有使自己的工作流于一般化和陷于落空的危险。
    当然，强调深入个别，并不是把个别和一般割裂开来，孤立地去抓个别单位的工作。深入个别是为了更好地指导一般，而且也只有在一般的正确指导之下，才能更好地做好深入个别的工作。因此，当我们深入到某一“点”和某一项工作的时候，必须经常密切地注意研究整个形势和工作的进展情况，注意研究和学习其他单位的经验，把个别单位的工作与整个工作紧密联系起来。至于要着重深入到那些点，要抓些什么问题，也必须从整个工作的进展情况出发来考虑，要有明确的全面观点。（摘自《重庆日报》）
