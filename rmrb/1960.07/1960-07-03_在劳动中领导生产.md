Leading Production Through Labor

Zhao Changfu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Pengwa Brigade of the Baixian Commune in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, woke up before dawn and headed towards the Second Production Team. The rice paddies of the Second Team were already full of people and bustling with activity! Zhao Changfu went down into the field and started working alongside the commune members. While weeding, he chatted with them, and through the conversation, he discovered a problem. It turned out that the cadres of the Second Team believed that their team had fewer rice paddies and more manpower than other teams, so they wouldn't fall behind even if they worked slower. The commune members felt that there was no reasonable division of labor in the work organization, so they were all doing the same thing, and the work points were the same regardless of how fast or slow they worked. Therefore, everyone was watching each other, and no one was working enthusiastically. After Zhao Changfu grasped the situation, he immediately considered ways to improve it. After lunch, during the midday break, he helped the production team cadres hold an emergency meeting. After reversing the cadres' complacent idea that "having less land means there's no need to rush," he also helped formulate a short-term contract plan for the current farm work, which was implemented among the commune members in the afternoon. After work began, the fields of the Second Team immediately showed a scene of intense activity, and the commune members were all full of energy. In less than two hours, they weeded more than fifteen mu of land, which was more than they had done the entire morning, and the quality was also better.

    在劳动中领导生产
    江苏灌云县白蚬公社彭洼大队党总支书记赵长富同志一觉醒来，天还没亮，便向第二生产队走去。这时，二队的稻田里，已满是人，好热闹啊！赵长富走下田，和社员们一起干了起来。他边耘耥边和社员们漫谈，从谈话中发现了问题，原来二队的干部们认为队里的稻田比别队少，人手又多，慢点干也不会落后。社员们认为在劳动组织上没有合理分工，干起活来一窝蜂，干快干慢都是一样记工分。因此，你观望我，我观望你，干得都不起劲。赵长富掌握了情况以后，便立刻考虑改进的办法。午饭后，利用歇晌的休息时间，帮助生产队干部开了个紧急会议。在扭转了干部们的“田少不愁忙”的麻痹思想后，又帮助制定出当前农活的小段包工计划，下午便在社员中贯彻推行。上工后，二队的田里立刻出现了一片紧张繁忙的景象，社员们个个干劲十足，还不到两个钟头，就耘耥十五亩多田，比整个上午干的活还多，质量也好。　　　　　（周良弼）
