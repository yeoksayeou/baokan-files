A large number of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian Province hold leadership positions in state organs, industry, transportation, finance and trade departments, cultural, educational and health institutions, and urban and rural people's communes. According to statistics, 17 people serve as members of the Fujian Provincial People's Committee, 43 people serve as members of county and city People's Committees, and 12 people serve as mayors and deputy mayors or county heads of the three cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou, and the eight counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, Fuqing, Minqing, Changle, Yongding, and Longyan. Even more serve as factory directors, managers, cooperative chairmen, and team leaders in industrial, transportation, finance and trade departments, cultural, educational, and health institutions, and communes. In Fuqing County's Yuxi People's Commune alone, 131 team leaders and deputy team leaders of production brigades and production teams are returned overseas Chinese and their relatives. There are also more returned overseas Chinese and their relatives among the deputies to the people's congresses at the provincial, city, county, and township levels.

Since the Great Leap Forward, these returned overseas Chinese and their relatives who hold leadership positions in state organs and production and construction posts have greatly demonstrated their revolutionary spirit and patriotism, contributing to accelerating our country's socialist construction and rapidly developing the industrial and agricultural production and various economic and cultural and educational undertakings in the hometowns of overseas Chinese. Gao Zhirong, the deputy county head of Fuqing County, returned from Indonesia in 1953. The year after his return, he was elected chairman of the Fuqing County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. Since 1956, he has been elected deputy county head twice. Since taking office, he has consistently been conscientious and responsible in his work. He often leaves his office to go deep among the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to understand the situation and solve problems, and has been praised by the people of his hometown. The returned overseas Chinese who serve as mayors and deputy mayors or county heads in other cities and counties also work actively and enthusiastically like Gao Zhirong.

Returned overseas Chinese and their relatives who hold leadership positions in rural communes, urban communes, factories, transportation, cultural, educational, and other production and construction posts have also fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for building socialism and have made contributions in various aspects. On the agricultural production front, they actively led commune members to participate in the high-yield movement of "thousand-catty rice and ten-thousand-catty sweet potatoes," and vigorously engaged in farmland water conservancy and mountain development. Chen Yucang, the leader of the "Huang Jiguang" youth shock brigade in the Ladian Commune of Xianyou County, led the youth to demand high yields from the land, implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and created a high-yield record of 4,163 catties of rice per mu. Huang Jinbang, the director of the Xiyang Brigade Comprehensive Farm in the Nielin Commune of Nan'an County, led 40 commune members to develop the mountains. In just one year, they turned a deserted mountain area into a good place with forests and fruits all over the mountains and pigs and cattle in groups. On the industrial and transportation fronts, they helped workers participate in the socialist emulation campaign of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, and strived to complete and overfulfill the various tasks of socialist construction in Fujian Province ahead of schedule. Lin Gongxiang, the deputy director of the Shangjie Mechanical Integrated Factory in Minhou County, successively created hot-blast stoves to replace foreign stoves and used waste aluminum instead of silicon iron to create rice seeders, as well as furrowers, potato slicers, gantry lathes, and eight-foot foreign lathes in technical innovations, and was repeatedly praised by the Party committee. On the cultural, educational, and health fronts, they carried forward the fine tradition of enthusiastically running public welfare undertakings in their hometowns. Chen Tianbian, the principal of the Haifeng Overseas Chinese Middle School in Yunxiao County, ran the school diligently and thriftily, and carried out the combination of learning and labor among the students, achieving a double harvest of learning and labor, and became a red flag of agricultural middle schools in the county. These exemplary behaviors have promoted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, and have driven the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to further develop their enthusiasm for labor. Through participating in productive labor, the mental outlook of the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives has undergone great changes. Love of labor and love of the collective have become new trends in the hometowns of overseas Chinese.

    为加速发展侨乡经济文化事业作出了贡献
    本报讯　福建省大批归国华侨、侨眷在国家政权机关、工业、交通、财贸部门，文教卫生事业单位和城市农村人民公社担任了领导工作。据统计，现在福建省人民委员会担任委员的有十七人，担任县、市人民委员会委员的有四十三人，还有十二人分别担任了福州、厦门、泉州三个市和晋江、南安、同安、福清、闽清、长乐、永定、龙岩八个县的正、副市长、县长；至于在工业交通财贸部门、文教卫生事业单位和公社担任正副厂长、经理、社长、大队长的为数更多。仅福清县的渔溪人民公社就有一百三十一个大队、中队的正、副队长是归侨和侨眷。在省和各市、县、乡各级人民代表大会的代表中还有为数更多的归侨、侨眷。
    大跃进以来，这些在国家政权机关、生产建设岗位担任领导工作的归侨、侨眷，都大大发挥了革命干劲和爱国主义精神，为加速我国的社会主义建设，高速度地发展华侨家乡的工、农业生产和各种经济事业、文化教育事业作出了贡献。在福清县担任副县长的高至荣，是1953年从印度尼西亚回国的，他回国的第二年被选为福清县归国华侨联谊会主席，1956年以来，连续两次被选为副县长，任职以后，工作一贯认真负责。他经常走出办公室深入到广大归侨、侨眷中了解情况，解决问题，受到了侨乡人民的赞扬。在其他各市、县担任正副市长、县长的归国侨胞，也都和高至荣一样积极热情地工作。
    在广大农村公社、城市公社和工厂交通文教等生产建设岗位上，担负领导工作的归侨、侨眷，也都充分发挥了建设社会主义的积极性，从各方面作出了贡献。在农业生产战线上，他们积极领导社员们参加千斤稻、万斤薯的丰产运动，大搞农田水利开发山区。仙游县赖店公社“黄继光”青年突击队队长陈玉苍，带领青年们向土地要高产，贯彻了农业八字宪法，创造出水稻亩产四千一百六十三斤的高产纪录；南安县聂林公社西洋大队综合农场场长黄金榜，带领了四十个社员开发山区，只经过短短的一年时间，便把一个荒无人烟的山区变成了林果满山，猪牛成群的好地方。在工业交通运输战线上，他们帮助了工人们参加学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义竞赛，为完成和提前完成福建省社会主义建设的各项任务而奋斗。在闽侯县上街机械综合厂担任副厂长的林恭翔，在技术革新中先后创造了热风炉代洋风炉，以废铝代替矽铁创造了水稻播种机，还有划行器、切薯器、龙门车床、八尺洋车床等，连续得到党委的表扬。在文教卫生战线上，他们发扬了热心兴办家乡公益事业的优良传统。云霄县海峰华侨中学校长陈天变，勤俭办学，在学生中开展了学习和劳动相结合，取得了学习和劳动双丰收，成为全县农业中学的一面红旗。他们的这些模范行为，都对广大归侨、侨眷起了促进作用，带动了广大归侨、侨眷进一步发扬了劳动积极性。通过参加生产劳动，广大归侨、侨眷的精神面貌都起了很大的变化。热爱劳动，热爱集体，已成为侨乡的新风尚。
