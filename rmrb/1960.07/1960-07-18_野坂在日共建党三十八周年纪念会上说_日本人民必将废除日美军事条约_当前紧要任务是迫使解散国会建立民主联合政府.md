Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 17th: Nosaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, said at the central rally commemorating the 38th anniversary of the founding of the JCP (July 15th) that the Japanese people are now determined and will surely abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
　　About 8,000 people, including JCP members and members of the Democratic Youth League, attended the celebration meeting.
　　In his speech, Nosaka pointed out that not recognizing the new "Security Treaty" and further striving to abolish it, crushing illegal suppression, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet, forcing the Diet to dissolve as soon as possible, allowing democratic forces to win in the general election, and further establishing a democratic coalition government against the new "Security Treaty" are the current urgent tasks of the Japanese people. He said that completing this task is possible.
　　Nosaka emphasized that through more than a year of struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," the Japanese people's political consciousness has been rapidly raised, the best weapon to defeat the enemy—joint struggle organizations—has been created, scientific methods of leading the masses to carry out activities have been established, and joint struggles with the people of Asia and the world have been successfully launched.
　　Nosaka pointed out that the Japanese people have achieved great achievements in the struggle against the "Security Treaty." These achievements have been obtained on the basis of the precious lives paid by thousands of martyrs in the Japanese people's liberation movement. We must inherit the spirit of the martyrs and fight to the end for Japan's peace, independence, democracy, and the realization of socialism.
　　Nosaka called on all JCP members to build a strong party under the glorious light of Marxism-Leninism and to strive for the establishment of a worker-peasant alliance and a national democratic united front.
　　Representatives of the JCP Tokyo Party Organization spoke at the meeting one after another, expressing their determination to unite firmly around the Party Central Committee and fully launch the struggle.
　　Guests attending the celebration of the 38th anniversary of the founding of the JCP included Iwadare Jukio, representative of the National Conference to Stop the Revision of the "Security Treaty," and Kono Sadazaburo, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Organizations. Li Xin-cheol, Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, and Jan Jerschek, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Austria who is visiting Japan, were also invited to attend the meeting.
　　In their speeches, many guests praised the JCP's past achievements in the democratic movement and the national liberation movement, and emphasized the huge role played by the JCP in the current struggle of the Japanese people, expressing their hope that the JCP will further strengthen its leadership of the Japanese people in the future.
　　Congratulatory letters from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Jurists Conference to Stop the Revision of the "Security Treaty" were read at the meeting.
　　JCP local committees at all levels have held celebrations of the party's birthday in various places.

　　野坂在日共建党三十八周年纪念会上说
　　日本人民必将废除日美军事条约
　　当前紧要任务是迫使解散国会建立民主联合政府
　  新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三16日在日共建党三十八周年（7月15日）纪念中央大会上讲话时说：日本人民目前坚定了信心，他们必将废除新日美“安全条约”。
    参加庆祝大会的有日共党员和民主青年同盟盟员等约八千人。
    野坂在讲话中指出，不承认新“安全条约”并且进一步争取废除这项条约，粉碎非法镇压，反对岸信介式的内阁，迫使尽快解散国会，在大选中让民主力量取得胜利，并进一步建立反对新“安全条约”的民主联合政府，这是日本人民当前的紧要任务。他说，完成这种任务是可能的。
    野坂强调指出，通过一年多来的反对修改“安全条约”斗争，日本人民的政治觉悟已迅速提高，创造了打倒敌人的最好武器——共同斗争组织，确立了领导群众展开活动的科学方法，并且胜利地展开了同亚洲和全世界人民的共同斗争。
    野坂指出，日本人民在反对“安全条约”斗争中已经获得了巨大成就，这是在日本人民解放运动中千万烈士付出自己宝贵生命的代价的基础上获得的，我们必须继承烈士的精神，为争取日本的和平、独立、民主和实现社会主义而斗争到底。
    野坂号召日共全体党员在马克思列宁主义光辉的照耀下，建立起强大的党，并且为建立工农联盟和民族民主统一战线而奋斗。
    日共东京党组织代表相继在会上讲话，表示坚决团结在党中央的周围，全力展开斗争。
    参加庆祝日共建党三十八周年大会的来宾有阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议代表岩垂寿喜男、全国商工团体联合会会长河野贞三郎等。旅日朝鲜人总联合会副议长李心哲和正在日本访问的奥地利共产党候补中央委员扬歇克也应邀参加了大会。
    许多来宾在致词中赞扬日共过去在民主运动和民族解放运动中的功绩，并且强调日共在目前日本人民斗争中所起的巨大作用，表示希望日共今后进一步加强领导日本人民。
    会上宣读了日本工会总评议会和阻止修改“安全条约”法学家会议等的贺信。
    日共各级地方委员会纷纷在各地举行庆祝党的生日的活动。
