Let the Spirit of the "Two-Five System" Bloom Everywhere

Starting from the beginning of April this year, Hebei Daily has been carrying out publicity and reports on improving leadership methods and work style, focusing on promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method, in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Hebei Daily first introduced the experience of Wuqiao County in implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method, and published an editorial, pointing out that this is the specific application of Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership method under the new situation. It called on all regions to universally promote this leadership method in order to overcome bureaucracy, enable the vast number of cadres to go deep into reality and among the masses, and rapidly improve their leadership level to meet the requirements of the situation. The newspaper promptly reported on the implementation of the "Two-Five System" in various places, promoting the development of a mass movement to improve leadership style and leadership methods. The process of promoting the "Two-Five System" is also a process of ideological struggle. Hebei Daily attached great importance to ideological mobilization, highlighting typical examples of good ideological work. After various places attached importance to the promotion of the "Two-Five System," Hebei Daily emphasized that different regions should promote it creatively according to their own circumstances. For example, it reported on Laiyuan County's experience in promoting the "Two-Five System" based on the local mountainous terrain, inconvenient transportation, and scattered residences.

After the vast number of cadres implemented the "Two-Five System" and went deep into the forefront of production, how exactly should they work? This is an urgent question that the newspaper needs to help solve. Hebei Daily successively introduced the experiences of county, commune, and management district cadres in implementing the "Two-Five System," and used facts to criticize the erroneous view that doing so would squeeze out departmental work. The newspaper also addressed some specific issues, such as how to study theory and policy, how to combine theory and practice, how to participate in production and lead production, how to learn well and help well, and how to summarize experience, and absorbed vivid examples from the movement to provide answers at any time. For example, the experience of Wuguan Camp Commune in Fengrun County in conscientiously promoting the "Two-Five System" and making their work more thorough and meticulous powerfully demonstrated that after cadres went to the countryside, they not only carried forward the "four togethers" style of eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, but also achieved the goal of using key points to lead the whole area, strengthening investigation and research, analyzing problems, and summarizing experience. The newspaper also published an editorial on this example.

The promotion of the "Two-Five System" requires corresponding improvements in the working methods of production teams and production groups. Hebei Daily timely reported on the "five-character" working method promoted by Zhengong Production Team in Gaocheng County and the "learn, do, research, encounter" working system promoted by the Second Team of Shuangliudian Management District in Chengguan Commune, Wuqiao County. The newspaper published commentaries around these typical examples to guide the movement to improve leadership style and leadership methods to develop step by step.

While publicizing the "Two-Five System," Hebei Daily combined it with reports on the "Five-Good" Cadre movement. Combining reports on improving working methods with reports on typical figures, seeing people, seeing things, and seeing ideas, can more powerfully encourage the vast number of cadres to learn from advanced models.

Although the "Two-Five System" is a good leadership method suitable for the conditions of counties, communes, and management districts, its spirit has universal significance. Starting from this point, Hebei Daily successively reported on the implementation of the "One-Three-Two System" by various agencies in Tianjin based on the characteristics of the city, and the initial implementation of the "One-Four-Seven System" by provincial-level agencies, and so on. It also published some commentaries. These reports promoted the spirit of the "Two-Five System" to bloom everywhere in both urban and rural areas throughout the province.

Hebei Daily's reports on improving leadership style and leadership methods have continued for more than three months. It can be seen that Hebei Daily's publicity of the new thing of the "Two-Five System" is not only enthusiastic, but also relatively meticulous and practical. Currently, the newspaper's publicity and reports on this issue are still developing in depth.

### 让“二五制”精神遍地开花

    让“二五制”精神遍地开花
    从今年4月初开始，河北日报就以推行“二五制”领导方法为中心，有计划有步骤地进行了改进领导方法、工作作风的宣传报道。
    河北日报首先介绍了吴桥县实行“二五制”领导方法的经验，并发表社论，指出这是毛泽东同志的领导方法在新形势下的具体运用，号召各地普遍推行这一领导方法，以克服官僚主义，使广大干部深入实际，深入群众，适应形势的要求迅速提高领导水平。报纸及时报道了各地推行“二五制”的情况，推动改进领导作风、领导方法的群众运动的开展。推行“二五制”的过程也是一个思想斗争过程。河北日报很重视思想发动工作，突出地介绍了思想工作做得好的典型事例。当着各地重视了“二五制”的推行以后，河北日报又强调不同地区应当根据自己的情况创造性地推行。如报道了涞源县根据当地山区交通不便、居住分散的情况，推行“二五制”的经验等。
    广大干部执行“二五制”后，深入到生产第一线，到底怎样工作？是迫切需要报纸帮助解决的。河北日报先后介绍了县、公社、管理区三级干部执行“二五制”的经验，用事实批判了认为这样做会挤掉部门工作等错误看法。报纸并针对一些具体问题，如怎样学习理论和政策，怎样使理论和实际相结合，怎样参加生产又领导生产、既学好又帮好，怎样总结经验等，随时吸取运动中的生动事例，进行了解答。比如丰润县五官营公社认真推行“二五制”，工作越作越深入细致的经验，就有力地说明了干部下乡以后，不仅发扬了与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量的“四同”作风，也做到了以点带面，加强了调查研究、分析问题、总结经验。报纸并就此事例发表社论。
    “二五制”的推行，要求生产队、生产小队的工作方法，也有相适应的改进。河北日报适时地报道了藁城县正公生产队推行的“五字”工作法和吴桥县城关公社双刘店管理区第二小队推行的“学、干、研、碰”工作制等，报纸围绕着这样一些典型发表评论，来引导改进领导作风、领导方法的运动步步深入。
    河北日报在宣传“二五制”的同时，结合报道了“五好”干部运动。使改进工作方法的报道和典型人物的报道相结合，见人见物见思想，可以更有力地鼓舞广大干部学赶先进的榜样。
    “二五制”虽然是一种适合于县、公社、管理区情况的好的领导方法，但是它的精神却具有普遍意义。河北日报从这一点出发，先后报道了天津市各机关根据城市特点推行“一三二制”，省级机关开始推行“一四七制”，等等。并发表了一些评论。这些报道促使“二五制”精神在全省城乡遍地开花。
    河北日报关于改进领导作风、领导方法的报道，已持续了三个多月。可以看出，河北日报对待“二五制”这一新事物的宣传，不仅是热情的，也是比较细致踏实的。目前报纸对这一问题的宣传报道，仍在向深入发展。
