Vigorously Grasp Fodder, Develop Pig Production
Zou Lin, First Secretary of the CCP Bobai County Committee

Before the troops move, food and fodder must go first. The deeper we get into raising pigs on a large scale, the more we realize the importance of vigorously grasping fodder production. In the past few years, because we didn’t focus enough on fodder production, the number of pigs always declined in late winter and early spring when fodder was scarce, only to rise again after March. Last year, we seriously summarized past experiences and lessons, and vigorously grasped fodder production. Over the past year, the number of pigs has been rising month by month. From January to May this year, the county overfulfilled its pig procurement task (which was four times higher than the same period last year). By the end of May, the number of pigs in stock rose to 454,500, an increase of 124% over the same period last year, achieving high-speed development of pig raising.

In vigorously grasping fodder production, we have the following points of experience:

1.  Grasping agricultural production well, and implementing a policy of giving equal importance to staple grains and coarse grains, is the fundamental way to produce the largest amount of pig feed. The roots, stems, leaves, vines, and fruits of crops are all good feed for pigs. According to surveys, more than 60% of pig feed consists of fine feed, coarse feed, and green feed derived from agricultural production. Grasping agricultural production is the foundation for the development of pig raising. Over the past few years, the Bobai County Committee has adhered to the policy of giving equal importance to staple grains and coarse grains, and comprehensively and rationally arranged agricultural production. Last year, the county's arrangement for 650,000 mu of paddy fields and 150,000 mu of sloping land was: in the early season, 580,000 mu were planted with rice, 53,000 mu with taro in rotation on dry land, and 150,000 mu with coarse grains on sloping land; in the late season, 578,000 mu were planted with rice and 120,000 mu with sweet potatoes on sloping land. During the winter planting season, another 220,000 mu were planted with coarse grains. In this way, from July last year to June this year, agricultural production successively obtained three bumper harvests in summer, autumn, and spring. After completing the state grain procurement task and arranging for seeds and rations, the three seasons of agricultural production provided a total of 49,270,000 jin of grains and potato feed for pig raising, an increase of 38.9% over the previous year. In addition, a large amount of coarse green feed was obtained from agricultural by-products such as tree leaves, peanut seedlings, banana pith, and sugarcane residue. The 110,000 mu of sweet potatoes planted in winter alone provided more than 130 million jin of sweet potato vines.

2. Appropriately allocate cultivated land, vigorously reclaim wasteland, and make full use of scattered land and ponds and ditches to produce feed, solving the contradiction between feed land and cultivated land. Because the harvest of agricultural production is intermittent and cannot fully meet the demand for feed, it is necessary to establish a regular feed base while grasping agricultural production. The central issue in establishing a feed base is to correctly handle the contradiction between feed land and cultivated land. Bobai County's approach is to: appropriately allocate a small portion of cultivated land as feed land; reclaim wasteland, advance into the hillsides, and make full use of scattered land and ponds and ditches for planting feed. By adopting the above three methods, an appropriate amount of feed base is established without occupying too much cultivated land, thus solving the contradiction between agriculture and animal husbandry over land use. In the operation and management of feed land, a system of graded establishment and graded operation is adopted. The county, communes, and production brigades have established feed professional teams. There are more than 800 professional teams in the county, with more than 3,200 laborers, who are unified under the leadership of pig farms at all levels for production. Commune members who raise pigs privately are allocated one fen of private land per household, and can also plant some melons and vegetables next to their houses. The pig feed for state organs, schools, factories, and mines is solved by reclaiming wasteland or planting on vacant land within the unit, without occupying agricultural cultivated land or labor.

3. Make careful arrangements for the entire year's feed production, and vigorously engage in intercropping, multiple cropping, and interplanting to ensure high yields and abundant harvests, and a continuous supply of feed. Based on the general growth period of feed crops being four months and the intermittent nature of agricultural harvests, the entire year's feed production is divided into three cycles, with planting and harvesting in each cycle. This ensures a continuous supply of feed in the winter and spring seasons, with harvests every month.

Feed production must also implement a policy that combines high yields and abundant harvests with planting a variety of crops. High yields and abundant harvests mean planting a variety of high-yielding feed crops. Aquatic feed is mainly water hyacinth and meat grass, while dry land feed is mainly corn, pumpkin, sow thistle, and bitter lettuce. Planting a variety of crops means vigorously engaging in multiple cropping, intercropping, and interplanting, with potato crops, melon crops, bean crops, tall-stem crops, and short-stem crops interspersed and crossed with each other, with planting and harvesting every month. According to calculations by the Shepo Brigade of the Shahe Commune, if the planting season is arranged tightly and care is taken, the total yield per mu can be converted to more than 5,000 jin of rice.

4. Seizing the opportunity to collect wild feed is an effective supplementary method for solving pig feed. According to experiments conducted in various places and appraisals by relevant departments, there are 76 kinds of wild plants in this county that can be used as pig feed. In addition, aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, crabs, and shellfish are nutritious fine feed. According to incomplete statistics, since this spring, the masses have been mobilized to collect more than 4 million jin of wild feed, which has played a significant supplementary role in the supply of pig feed.

    大抓饲料  发展养猪生产
    中共博白县委第一书记　邹林
    兵马未动，粮草先行。要大养其猪，必须大抓饲料生产。这一点对我们越来体会越深。过去几年，由于对饲料生产抓得不够，每当冬末春初，饲料青黄不接，生猪头数总是下降，3月以后才又回升。去年认真总结了过去的经验教训，大抓饲料生产，一年多来，生猪头数一直逐月上升。今年1至5月，全县提前超额完成了比去年同期增长四倍的生猪上调任务后，5月底存栏生猪仍上升至四十五万四千五百多头，比去年同期增长124％，实现了养猪的高速度发展。
    在大抓饲料生产中，我们有如下的几点体会：
    一、抓好农业生产，实行主粮、杂粮并举，是生产最大量的养猪饲料的根本办法。农作物的根、茎、叶、藤、实，都是猪的好饲料。据调查，在猪饲料中，取自农业生产的精料、粗料、青料合共占60％多。抓好农业生产，是生猪发展的基础。几年来，博白县委坚持贯彻主粮、杂粮并举的方针，全面合理安排农业生产。去年全县对六十五万亩水田和十五万亩坡地的安排是：上造，种水稻五十八万亩，在旱田轮种芋头五万三千亩，坡地种杂粮十五万亩，下造种水稻五十七万八千亩，坡地种红薯十二万亩，冬种时又种了一季杂粮二十二万亩。这样，从去年7月至今年6月这一年间，农业生产连续获得了夏季、秋季、春季三次丰收。在完成国家粮食征购任务和安排好种子、口粮的前提下，三造农业生产共为养猪提供谷类和薯类饲料四千九百二十七万多斤，比前一年度增长了38.9％。此外，从农业副产品如木叶、花生苗、芭蕉蕊、甘蔗渣等中，获得大批粗青饲料，仅冬种红薯十一万亩，便提供薯藤一亿三千多万斤。
    二、适当划拨耕地，大力开垦荒地，充分利用零星土地和水塘沟渠生产饲料，解决饲料地与耕地的矛盾。由于农业生产的收获有间歇性，不可能充分满足饲料需求，因此在抓好农业生产的同时，还必须建立经常的饲料基地。建立饲料基地的中心问题是要正确处理饲料地与耕地的矛盾。博白县的做法是：适当划拨一小部分耕地作饲料地；开垦荒地，向山坡进军和充分利用零星土地和水塘、沟渠种植饲料。采取以上三项办法，既建立了适当数量饲料基地，又不占用过多耕地，解决了农牧争地的矛盾。在饲料地的经营管理上，采取分级建立、分级经营的办法。县、公社、大队，建立饲料专业队。全县共有专业队八百多个，劳动力三千二百多人，统一在各级猪场的领导下进行生产。社员私人养猪，以户为单位，划给自留地一分，并可在自己宅旁种植一些瓜菜。国家机关、学校、厂矿、企业的养猪饲料，自行开荒或者本单位的空地种植解决，不占用农业耕地和劳力。
    三、周密安排全年的饲料生产，大搞间种、复种、套种，保证高产多收，饲料供应源源不断。根据饲料作物一般生长期为四个月和农业收获有间歇性的特点，把全年饲料生产划分为三个周期，每个周期内都有种有收。这就保证了冬春两季饲料源源不断，月月有收。
    饲料生产，也要实行高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针。高产多收，就是多种高产饲料作物。水生饲料以水葫芦、肉草为主，旱地饲料以玉米、南瓜、猪母菜、苦脉菜为主。多种多收，就是大搞复种、间种、套种，把薯类作物、瓜类作物、豆类作物、高秆作物与低秆作物等，互相穿插交叉，月月有收有种。据沙河公社社坡大队计算，种植季节安排得紧，护理又好的，每亩地收获总产量可折稻谷五千斤以上。
    四、抓紧时机，采集野生饲料，是解决养猪饲料的一个有效的辅助办法。据各地试验和有关部门鉴定，本县共有七十六种野生植物可作养猪饲料。此外，水生的鱼、虾、蟹、蚌等水生动物，更是营养丰富的精饲料，据不完全统计，今春以来，已发动群众突击采集野生饲料共四百多万斤，对养猪饲料的供应起到很大的辅助作用。
