The Direction of Ninety-Three Kilograms
Wu Lü

"Let the blast furnace eat its fill and eat well!" This is the goal of the vast number of workers on iron mines across the country, who are going all out to support steel production. With the mining workers providing such enthusiastic and vigorous support for steel production, what attitude should the iron-smelting workers adopt when truckloads of ore are transported to the blast furnace? The attitude of the iron-smelting workers at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel is: pay more attention to saving ore. In June, the average ore consumption for smelting one ton of iron in the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant decreased by ninety-three kilograms compared to May.

Ninety-three kilograms, the number may not seem like much, but it represents a direction. That is, putting the part in the whole, and treating local work with a holistic view.

The principle of the part being subordinate to the whole, of "the whole country as a single chessboard," is known to everyone; however, the depth of understanding varies, and the degree to which this principle is implemented in actual work also varies. In the minds of some comrades, this principle seems to be important only for those units that are responsible for transferring products out, and for supporting others. It seems that units that need to import products from other places, and units that need support from others, do not have the problem of the relationship between the part and the whole. In fact, this is not the case. Units that are responsible for transferring products out, and units that are responsible for supporting others are certainly a part, and units that need to import ore, coal, and pig iron from other places, are also a part. The part is subordinate to the whole; this applies to everyone, without exception.

Ensuring that the iron and steel industry's great leap forward has sufficient supplies, first of all, is to ensure that key iron and steel enterprises have sufficient supplies. This is the overall interest of national construction. Units responsible for transferring ore, coal, and iron should put the overall interest first, prioritize external needs over internal needs, and complete the external transfer tasks on time, in quantity, and with quality. This is without question. Units that need to import ore, coal, and pig iron from other places, especially key units among them, as another aspect of the part, should also appreciate the value of every ton of ore, every ton of coal, and every ton of pig iron, and save as much as possible on ore, coal, and iron. This connects the part with the whole, puts the part in the whole, and treats local work with a holistic view. As a result, it benefits both the whole and the part. If the part is placed outside the whole, and it is thought that because there is support from others anyway, these tasks are relaxed, the result will be detrimental to both the whole and the part.

"The direction of ninety-three kilograms" has universal significance. The use of ore should be like this, and the use of coke should also be like this; steelmaking workers' use of pig iron should be like this, textile workers' use of cotton should be like this, and key construction units, who are leading the way, should use building materials like this.

　　九十三公斤的方向
　　吴滤
    “让高炉吃饱吃好！”这是全国铁矿山上广大职工全力以赴的目标。在采矿工人对钢铁生产这种满腔热情的大力支援下，当一车一车的矿石运到高炉旁边的时候，炼铁工人应该采取什么态度呢？马钢炼铁工人的态度是：更加注意节约用矿。6月份，炼铁一厂平均每炼一吨铁的矿石消耗就比5月份降低了九十三公斤。
    九十三公斤，数目看来不算很多，却代表着一个方向。这就是把局部放在整体之中，用整体观念来对待局部工作。
    局部服从整体，“全国一盘棋”，这个道理是人人都知道的；不过，知道的深浅还有所不同，把这个方针贯彻到实际工作中去的好坏程度也有所不同。在有些同志的心目中，这个方针，似乎是对于那些担负着产品外调任务、担负着支援别人任务的单位才是重要的，需要从外地调进产品的单位、需要别人支援的单位，好像就不存在局部和整体的关系问题。其实不然，担负着产品外调任务的单位、担负着支援别人的任务的单位固然是一个局部，需要从外地调进产品的单位、被别人支援的单位，也同样是一个局部。局部服从整体，彼此皆然，并无例外。
    保证钢铁工业的跃进有充足的粮草，首先是保证重点钢铁企业有充足的粮草，这是国家建设的整体利益。担负着调矿、调煤、调铁任务的单位，应该把整体利益放在第一位，先外后内，按时、按量、按质地完成外调任务，这是毫无疑问的。需要从外地调进矿石、煤炭、生铁的单位，特别是其中的重点单位，作为另一方面的局部，也要体会到每一吨矿石、每一吨煤炭和每一吨生铁的可贵，尽可能地节约用矿、节约用煤、节约用铁。这就把局部同整体联系起来，把局部放在整体之中，用整体观念来对待局部的工作。其结果，既利于整体，也利于局部。如果把局部置于整体之外，以为反正有别人的支援，就放松了这一系列的工作，其结果，既不利于整体，也不利于局部。
      “九十三公斤的方向”是有普遍意义的。矿石的使用应该这样，对焦炭的使用也应该这样；炼钢工人对生铁的使用应该这样，纺织工人对棉花的使用应该这样，在排队中名列前茅的基本建设重点单位，对建筑材料的使用也应该这样。
