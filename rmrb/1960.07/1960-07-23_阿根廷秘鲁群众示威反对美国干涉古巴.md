“Cuba Yes, Yankees No!” Resounds Throughout Latin America
Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, July 21st. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina issued a statement regarding the United States' aggressive actions against Cuba, stating: "The number one enemy of freedom, national independence, and peace, American imperialism, after organizing economic aggression against the Cuban people, has attempted and is still attempting to carry out armed aggression against Cuba."
　　
The statement said that the cause of Cuba is the cause of Latin America. "Defending the cause of Cuba is not only fulfilling the sacred responsibility of providing international support to the people of all countries striving for liberation from imperialist enslavement, but also defending our own right to independence." The statement called on the Argentine people to unite and prevent the United States from repeating "the serious crimes committed against Guatemala" against Cuba.

The statement pointed out that due to the failure of the diplomatic and economic pressure exerted by the United States on Cuba, the United States government is desperately intensifying its plans for armed aggression. However, the Cuban people and government have shown their determination to bravely defend the freedom of their motherland. They are not isolated; they will receive active support from all of Latin America and the world, as well as the support of the powerful Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

The statement said that under the pretext of anti-communism, American imperialism is attempting to prevent the Cuban people from freely deciding their own destiny, fearing that Cuba's example will be promoted in all Latin American countries.

The statement emphasized that the United States, under the pretext of opposing the non-existent Soviet "interference" in the Caribbean, is implementing the Monroe Doctrine to control Latin American countries. The statement said, "It is clear that the struggle against the preparation for aggression against Cuba is part of the great struggle of people all over the world against war and for peace."

The statement exposed the United States' attempt to use the Organization of American States to pull some Latin American countries together to launch an attack on Cuba, and condemned the Argentine government for following the United States and participating in the conspiracy to interfere in Cuba.

The statement demanded that the Argentine people strengthen their solidarity with the Cuban people and the Cuban government, stop imperialist aggression, and make the government revise its current policy toward Cuba. The statement concluded, "Yankee bloodstained hands off Cuba!"

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, July 21st. Nearly two thousand people held a demonstration in front of the American Consulate here tonight, expressing support for the Cuban Revolution. Demonstrators shouted: "Cuba Yes, Yankees No!" "Yankees Get Out of Cuba!" "Cuba is Not Isolated!"

Those leading the march held up a huge banner depicting an Argentine "gaucho" embracing a Cuban "bearded one" (symbol of the Cuban rebel army).

This afternoon, demonstrators in various districts of the capital distributed thousands of leaflets supporting the Cuban Revolution on the main streets. These leaflets, signed by the Argentine Committee of Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, said, "Cuba and other Latin American countries are threatened by the United States and piratical aggression." The leaflet also pointed out that the "Monroe Doctrine" shouted by American imperialism aims to strangle the Cuban Revolution. The leaflets called on all Argentine people to unite and fight against the common enemy of the Latin American people—American imperialism—and defend the Cuban Revolution.

This morning, slogans expressing support for the Cuban Revolution appeared in paint on the walls of various districts of Buenos Aires.

Xinhua News Agency, Lima, July 21st. More than one hundred university students in Lima, the capital of Peru, demonstrated in front of the American Embassy last night, opposing US interference in Cuba and supporting the Cuban Revolution.

The students shouted slogans such as "Cuba Yes, Yankees No," "Down with American Imperialism," and "Long Live the Cuban Revolution." They distributed leaflets against American imperialist interference in Cuba and wrote anti-imperialist slogans on the sidewalks near the American Embassy. Angry demonstrators also burned an American flag.

The San Marcos University Student Federation has decided to hold a mass rally on the 22nd to support Cuba and oppose American aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, July 21st. Five hundred people from all walks of life in Colombia held a rally in front of the statue of national hero José María Carbonell in Bogotá, the capital, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Colombia's independence from Spanish colonial rule. Leaders of the Colombian Communist Party, the Liberal Party People's Movement, the National Student Union, and the Socialist Party, as well as some young parliamentarians from the Conservative Party, attended the meeting.

Felipe Salazar Santos, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party and a member of parliament, and others who spoke at the meeting resolutely stated that the Colombian people should unite to support the Cuban Revolution, which is a beacon illuminating the movements of the peoples of Latin American countries in recovering national sovereignty. Speakers emphasized that "the cause of Cuba is the cause of Colombia, and we swear to do everything in our power and by all means to defend the Cuban Revolution."

The conference announced that a grand demonstration in support of the Cuban Revolution will be held on July 30th.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires. Manuel Galich, former Guatemalan Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Argentina, published an article in the "Action" weekly on the 19th, pointing out that the purpose of the so-called "aid to Latin American countries plan" announced by US President Eisenhower is to lure Latin American countries to follow the United States in interfering in Cuba. The article said that the conditions of Eisenhower's "plan" are: "Those who want to accept (American) 'aid' must dare to strangle the Cuban Revolution."

The article said that the "promises" of American political and financial leaders regarding "aid" to Latin America are "a wonderful and cheap commodity for collectors of curiosities." The article pointed out that no facts of the United States genuinely aiding other countries have ever been found.

The article criticized the Peruvian and Argentine governments for "stepping up their service to American imperialism" under the inducement of the United States. The article said, "If we want to obtain wealth and freedom for ourselves, as the Cuban Revolution has done," we must smash the enslaving obstacles of the Monroe Doctrine.

    声明说，美帝国主义在反共的借口下，企图阻挠古巴人民自由地决定自己的命运，它担心古巴的榜样将在所有拉丁美洲国家中推广。
    声明着重指出，美国在反对并不存在的苏联对加勒比海的“干涉”的借口下，实行用来控制拉丁美洲国家的门罗主义。声明说，“很清楚，反对准备对古巴进行侵略的斗争是世界各国人民反对战争、争取和平的伟大斗争的一部分。”
    声明揭露美国企图利用美洲国家组织来把一些拉丁美洲国家拉在一起，发动对古巴的进攻，并且谴责阿根廷政府追随美国，参与干涉古巴的阴谋。

    文章说，美国政治和财政首脑关于“援助”拉丁美洲的“诺言”是“奇闻搜集家的一种美妙的廉价货”。文章指出，从来也找不出任何美国真正援助其它国家的事实。
    文章批评秘鲁和阿根廷政府在美国诱骗下“加紧为美帝国主义效劳”。文章说，“如果想像古巴革命所做的那样，自己为自己取得财富和自由”，就必须粉碎门罗主义的奴役性的障碍。
