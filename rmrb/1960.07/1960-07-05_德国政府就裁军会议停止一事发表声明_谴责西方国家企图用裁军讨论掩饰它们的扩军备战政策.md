Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 3rd: The government of the German Democratic Republic’s statement regarding the suspension of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting in Geneva has been released here. The statement emphasizes that Western countries, forced to sit at the negotiating table by pressure from people around the world, are attempting to use fruitless disarmament discussions to conceal their policies of arms expansion and war preparations. Thanks to the consistent stance taken by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries participating in the committee, this deceptive practice by Western countries has been shattered.

The statement said that the government of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the Soviet government's assessment of the situation of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee in its note of June 27, 1960. The statement pointed out that if socialist countries continued to participate in the work of this committee, it would help the American ruling circles to undermine disarmament, and it would mislead world public opinion. The government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the Soviet government's step of submitting the disarmament issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The government of the German Democratic Republic also believes that, on the one hand, adhering to the principle of parity between the representatives of socialist and Western countries in negotiations, and on the other hand, absorbing other countries to participate in disarmament negotiations, will help achieve good results.

The statement said that the government of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that the Bonn government's statement expressing regret over the developments in Geneva is clearly hypocritical.

The statement pointed out that the task of the people and governments of all countries is to smash the resistance of those groups who want to persist in the "cold war" policy and deceive the people of all countries.

The German Democratic Republic also advocates for immediate and complete disarmament in the two Germanys. It still insists on its proposals for concluding a treaty of non-aggression between the two Germanys and for the two Germanys to abandon atomic armaments and rocket base facilities.

    德国政府就裁军会议停止一事发表声明
    谴责西方国家企图用裁军讨论掩饰它们的扩军备战政策
    新华社柏林3日电　此间公布了德意志民主共和国政府就日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议停止一事所发表的声明。声明着重指出，在各国人民压力下被迫坐在谈判桌旁的西方国家，企图用无结果的裁军讨论来掩饰它们的扩军备战政策。由于苏联和参加委员会的其他社会主义国家所采取的一贯立场，西方国家这种欺骗人民的做法已被粉碎。
    声明说，德意志民主共和国政府完全同意苏联政府在它的1960年6月27日的照会中对十国裁军委员会状况的评价。声明指出，如果社会主义国家继续参加这个委员会的工作，那就会有助于美国统治集团对裁军进行破坏，那就会迷惑世界公众。德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联政府把裁军问题提交联合国大会讨论的步骤。德意志民主共和国政府还认为，一方面要遵循社会主义国家和西方国家在谈判中的代表对等的原则，一方面应该吸收其他一些国家参加裁军谈判，这将有助于取得良好的成果。
    声明说，德意志民主共和国政府指出，波恩政府对于日内瓦事态的发展表示遗憾的声明显然是虚伪的。
    声明指出，各国人民和政府的任务是粉碎那些想坚持“冷战”政策和欺骗各国人民的集团的反抗。
    德意志民主共和国还主张在两个德国立即实现全面和彻底裁军。它仍旧坚持它的缔结两个德国之间互不侵犯条约以及两个德国放弃原子军备和火箭基地设施的建议。
