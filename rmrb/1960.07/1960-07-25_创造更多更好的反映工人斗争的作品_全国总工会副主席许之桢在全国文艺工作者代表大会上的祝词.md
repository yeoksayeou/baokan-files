Comrades:

As our country is in the upsurge of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and brilliant achievements have been made on the production front, the literary and art front, and all fronts, the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers is opening. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the congress and to the representatives from all over the country.

At present, we are facing an unprecedentedly favorable situation. Internationally, the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. The struggles of the people of all countries against the aggression of imperialism headed by the United States to defend world peace, and the struggles of oppressed nations for national independence and democratic freedom, have achieved a series of new and great victories. Domestically, under the encouragement of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and on the basis of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the people of the whole country are realizing the comprehensive and sustained leap forward of the national economy this year. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on China's industrial front has converged with the movement of technical transformation on the agricultural front to form a torrent of technical revolution, forming a high tide of mass movement by the whole people in an all-round way. The rapid development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has also promoted the great upsurge of the cultural revolution movement. In factories and mines, workers' spare-time education has also entered a new stage. Many industrial and mining enterprises have established a system of workers' spare-time education from elementary to higher levels, and many achievements have been made in eliminating illiteracy and running spare-time universities on a large scale. The upsurge of workers studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works is being carried out extensively and deeply. Mao Zedong's works have become a sharp weapon to guide and encourage workers to engage in ideological revolution and technical revolution.

The emergence of the high tide of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution is the result of the great upsurge of the communist spirit of the workers and masses. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the workers and masses have taken on difficulties, offered convenience, caught up with the advanced, learned from the advanced, and helped the backward, breaking superstitions, overcoming difficulties, and displaying a noble communist style. In their daily labor, they put the public before the private, others before themselves, took on difficulties, and gave up honors, developing the spirit of collectivism. In production and learning, they studied diligently, worked hard, persevered, and fought tenaciously, demonstrating the great thought of continuous revolution. Some were even fearless in the face of danger, refusing to compromise in the face of adversity. In order to protect state property and for the benefit of the collective, they did not consider personal gains or losses at all, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the working class. All these advanced thoughts, advanced figures, and advanced deeds are inexhaustible sources for writers and artists to carry out literary and artistic creation.

Since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, writers and artists have followed the Party's policies, gone to the countryside and mountains, gone deep into factories, gone deep among the masses, implemented Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the Party's literary and artistic policies, and created a large number of literary and artistic works. Among them, nearly twenty novels reflecting socialist industrialization and the struggles of workers, and even more medium and short stories. In the past two years, the film industry has produced dozens of feature films and artistic documentaries reflecting new figures and new ideas among workers. In drama, music, dance, quyi, fine arts, etc., there have also been many touching works reflecting the struggles of workers. This is a great harvest of China's literary and artistic undertakings, and this is the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the Party's literary and artistic policies.

Comrades! Your works have educated and encouraged the broad masses of workers. Your activities have promoted the development of workers' spare-time literary and artistic activities. The broad masses of workers across the country are praising your achievements. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, and through you, to the literary and artistic fighters across the country who serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and express my high respect.

Writers and artists go deep into factories and mines, and eat, live, and labor with the workers, which also plays a role in promoting the popularization and improvement of workers' spare-time literary and artistic activities. Workers' spare-time literary and artistic activities have formed mass activities. More than three million workers in industrial and mining enterprises participate in the activities, many of whom are advanced producers, red banner bearers, and skilled women. Workers' creations are unprecedentedly prosperous. They not only learn and use national folk art forms, but also innovate and develop national folk art forms. The poems, dramas, music, dances, quyi, paintings, and photography created by workers are closely combined with current political movements and production movements, and reflect the reality of struggle. Under the leadership of the Party, thanks to the diligent study and hard practice of the workers, and thanks to the guidance and assistance of professional literary and artistic teams, a group of literary and artistic workers from worker backgrounds has emerged in the past eleven years. Their works have also had a certain impact among the masses. After the upsurge of eliminating illiteracy and the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works, the workers have improved their cultural level and political awareness, and also improved their appreciation of literature and art. More and more people are asking to read literary and artistic works, create their own works, and comment on various literary and artistic works. This trend of workers' spare-time literary and artistic activities becoming more popular and more improved requires professional literary and artistic groups and literary and artistic workers to strengthen guidance.

Comrades, with the sustained leap forward in production, the spiritual outlook of the working class has become more profound, and communist awareness will be further enhanced. We hope that more and more literary and artistic workers will describe the struggles and lives of the working class. We hope that in the future there will be not dozens, but hundreds of literary and artistic works shining with communist ideological light, educating and influencing the working class, improving their communist ideological awareness and moral character, encouraging their enthusiasm for building socialism, and helping them to continuously achieve new victories. We believe that through this congress, we will summarize and exchange the experiences of literary and artistic workers in going deep among workers, peasants and soldiers, participating in labor and practical work, and more deeply carry out the struggle against various bourgeois ideas and against revisionism, so that literary and artistic workers can further integrate with workers, peasants and soldiers, serve politics, serve production, promote the socialist construction cause of our country to develop more rapidly, and build our country into a powerful country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Comrades, let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, create more and better literary and artistic works that are loved by workers, peasants and soldiers, and strive to promote greater prosperity, popularization, and improvement of socialist literature and art!

I wish the congress a success!

    创造更多更好的反映工人斗争的作品
    全国总工会副主席许之桢在全国文艺工作者代表大会上的祝词同志们：
    正当我国处在技术革命和文化革命高潮，生产战线、文艺战线以及各个战线都取得辉煌成就的时候，中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会开幕了，我谨代表中华全国总工会向大会，向来自全国各地的代表，致以热烈的祝贺。
    目前，我们正面临着空前未有的大好形势。在国际上，东风继续压倒西风，各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平的斗争，被压迫民族争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争，都已经取得了一系列新的伟大胜利。我们国内，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，在两年连续大跃进的基础上，全国人民正在实现今年国民经济的全面的持续跃进。在党中央和毛主席的领导下，我国工业战线上的技术革新、技术革命的运动已同农业战线上的技术改造运动汇成了一股技术大革命的洪流，形成了全民的、全面的群众运动高潮。技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展，又促进了文化革命运动的巨大高涨。在工矿中，职工业余教育也进入到一个新的阶段，不少工矿企业建立了从初等到高等的职工业余教育体系，扫除文盲和大办业余大学的工作取得许多成就。工人群众学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作的高潮，正在广泛、深入地开展。毛泽东著作已经成为指导和鼓励工人从事思想革命和技术革命的锐利武器。
    技术革命和文化革命高潮的出现，是职工群众共产主义精神大高涨的结果，职工群众在增产节约运动中，抢困难、让方便、赶先进、学先进、帮后进，破除迷信、战胜困难，发挥了崇高的共产主义风格；在日常劳动中，先公后私、先人后己，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，发扬了集体主义精神；在生产和学习上，刻苦钻研，埋头苦干，坚韧不拔，顽强战斗，显示出了不断革命的伟大思想。有的更是临危不惧，临难不苟，为了保护国家财产，为了集体的利益，丝毫不考虑个人得失，表现出了工人阶级的英雄气概。所有这些先进思想、先进人物、先进事迹都是作家、艺术家进行文学艺术创作取之不竭的泉源。
    建国以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，作家、艺术家遵循党的政策，下乡上山，深入工厂，深入群众，贯彻毛泽东文艺思想和党的文艺方针，创作出大量的文艺作品。其中反映社会主义工业化和工人斗争生活的长篇小说将近二十部，中、短篇小说数量就更多。电影事业在最近两年拍摄了几十部反映职工中新人物、新思想的故事片和艺术纪录片。在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、美术等等方面，也出现了很多感人的反映工人斗争的作品，这是我国文学艺术事业的大丰收，这是毛泽东文艺思想和党的文艺方针的胜利。
    同志们！你们的作品，教育和鼓舞了广大职工群众，你们的这些活动，促进了职工业余文艺活动的发展，全国职工群众都在称赞你们所取得的成就，我谨代表中华全国总工会向您们致以衷心的感谢，并通过您们向全国为工农兵服务的文艺战士们，表示崇高的敬意。
    作家、艺术家深入工矿，和职工同吃、同住、同劳动，对职工的业余文艺活动的普及和提高也起着促进的作用。职工业余文艺活动已形成群众性的活动，工矿企业中参加活动的职工已达三百多万人，其中不少是先进生产者、红旗手、巧姑娘。职工创作空前繁荣，他们不仅学习和运用着民族民间艺术形式，还在革新和发展民族民间艺术形式。职工创作的诗歌、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、绘画、摄影，又都是紧密结合当前政治运动、生产运动，反映现实斗争的。十一年来，在党的领导下，由于职工的勤学苦练，由于专业文艺队伍的辅导和帮助，已经产生了一批工人出身的文学、艺术工作者，他们的作品在群众当中也产生了一定的影响。扫除文盲的高潮和学习毛主席著作的高潮兴起后，职工提高了文化水平和政治觉悟程度，也提高了对文学艺术的欣赏水平，已经有越来越多的人要求阅读文艺作品，自己创作，并且评论各种文艺作品。职工业余文艺活动这种走向更加普及、更加提高的趋势，要求专业文艺团体、文艺工作者加强辅导。
    同志们，随着生产的持续跃进，工人阶级的精神面貌的变化更加深刻，共产主义觉悟会更加提高，我们希望有越来越多的文学艺术工作者描写工人阶级的斗争生活，希望将来出现的不是几十部，而是几百部闪烁着共产主义思想光芒的文学艺术作品，教育和影响工人阶级，提高他们共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，鼓舞他们建设社会主义的干劲，帮助他们不断取得新的胜利。我们相信，经过这次大会，总结和交流文艺工作者深入工农兵、参加劳动锻炼和实际工作的经验，更深入地开展反对各种资产阶级思想和反对修正主义的斗争，使文艺工作者同工农兵进一步结合起来，为政治服务，为生产服务，推动我国社会主义建设事业更加突飞猛进地向前发展，把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大国家。同志们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，创作出为工农兵所喜爱的更多更好的文艺作品，为促使社会主义文学艺术更大的繁荣、普及、提高而奋斗吧！
    祝大会成功！
