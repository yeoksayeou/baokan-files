Mastering Natural Laws to Guide Agricultural Production
Zhao Ren, First Secretary of the Songjiang County Party Committee

Songjiang County, a suburb of Shanghai, cultivates rice on over 95% of its arable land. It has always been known for its meticulous farming practices, earning it the title of "Land of Rice." Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the guidance and inspiration of the General Line, the vast number of cadres and masses in the county have begun to pay attention to studying the laws of increasing rice production, exploring ways to achieve higher and higher yields. As a result, farming and management standards have been further improved, and yields have increased year after year. However, for the county as a whole, the laws of increasing rice production have not been grasped by more cadres and members, leading to an imbalance in the rate of increase, with varying yields, and a significant difference between high and low yields. In 1959, the county saw a thousand-jin production team with a comprehensive high yield of rice, as well as 31,900 mu of thousand-jin rice fields. On the other hand, there were also many low-yield fields with yields of three to four hundred jin and five to six hundred jin per mu. Why were some fields yielding higher, some lower, and some even very low? The County Party Committee believes that while there are objective reasons, such as soil quality, altitude, original yield base, etc., these are not the main factors. The main factor is whether people have grasped the laws of increasing rice production and whether they have fully exerted their subjective initiative under the conditions of mastering the laws of increasing rice production.

Based on this understanding, the Songjiang County Party Committee, in leading rice production this year, fully mobilized the masses from the very beginning, organized the entire party and all the people, and used comparative methods to summarize high-yield experiences and draw lessons from low-yield experiences, in order to achieve the goal of understanding and mastering the laws of increasing rice production. In this process, we criticized two kinds of thinking and two kinds of attitudes. The first was looking at problems from a narrow historical experience, which restricted their thinking, leading to right-leaning conservatism, a reluctance to think and act boldly. The second was starting from subjective wishes, not being good at or not knowing how to find objective laws, so although they had enthusiasm, they often achieved half the result with twice the effort, and did not get the expected results. The County Party Committee educated everyone: We must respect objective laws and give full play to our subjective initiative, understand and apply objective laws, and be the masters of nature. This education greatly increased the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for studying the laws of increasing rice production and the consciousness of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

On the basis of unified understanding, the County Party Committee again mobilized the masses and, according to the growth law of rice, formulated technical operating procedures that echoed from beginning to end and connected segment by segment. Specifically, rice production involves "passing five checkpoints." What are the "five checkpoints"? The first is the preparation checkpoint: having foresight and starting early, completing all the preparatory work to ensure increased rice production in the winter and spring campaigns. According to the characteristics of Songjiang's natural conditions, we determined that water control, soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, and fertilizer production should be the focus, and we carried out large-scale water conservancy, soil improvement, and fertilizer accumulation. The second is the sowing checkpoint: under the guidance of the thought of "a thousand-jin plan, quality first," we tried every means to cultivate strong seedlings, deep plowing and deep turning, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and rational close planting, setting a high standard and high quality, laying a good foundation, and eliminating third-class seedlings in the sowing period. The third is the tillering checkpoint: "When yellow seedlings are transplanted, management comes first." In field management, with "water" and "fertilizer" as the center, we rationally irrigated and applied topdressing, and diligently cultivated and harrowed to loosen the soil and remove weeds, ensuring that each mu of rice field had about 300,000 effective panicles. According to our typical survey of 145 thousand-jin rice fields, if a mu of rice field has about 300,000 effective panicles between "Minor Heat" and "Major Heat," then, with further promotion, achieving large panicles and full grains, a yield of 1,000 jin per mu is very likely. The fourth is the panicle initiation checkpoint: heavily apply panicle fertilizer, control water levels, control pests and diseases, and resist drought and flood, striving for large panicles and many grains on the basis of many panicles. The overall goal of this "checkpoint" is to require the growth of large panicles, not small panicles, and even more to prevent the appearance of white empty panicles, with each effective panicle having at least 60 grains of rice. The fifth is the grain weight checkpoint: according to the experience of the thousand-jin rice fields, "more irrigation means more skin on the grain," strengthening water management in the later stage and adhering to topdressing according to the seedlings has a great relationship with grain plumpness and weight. Therefore, it is necessary to follow the growth law of rice in the later stage, uphold the idea of continuous revolution, break the idea that "Autumn Equinox" determines the outcome, do a good job in the management of the "last five minutes," and truly achieve "management does not stop until the crops are harvested."

We deeply realize that it is very necessary to formulate such a "passing five checkpoints" technical operating procedure that considers the overall situation and promotes segment by segment, according to the general law of rice growth and the specific laws of each stage. By doing so, there are arrangements for the entire season, key points for each segment, specific requirements, a clear direction of attack, one checkpoint after another, one battle after another, and once we conquer them, we can always maintain the initiative until the final victory.

In Songjiang County, the first and second checkpoints have been successfully broken through. This year, 750,000 mu of rice have been planted in the county, and the quality of cultivation is generally better than in previous years. The specifications and quality of early-planted rice fields and late-planted rice fields have basically reached "the same standard," thus changing the unbalanced situation of "fine in the early stage and rough in the later stage" that occurred in previous years in order to rush the season. This has laid a good foundation for a large area of balanced rice production increase. At present, the vast number of cadres and members in the county are aiming at "about 300,000 effective panicles per mu" and are fiercely attacking the third checkpoint, and have already achieved initial victory. According to recent field observations, the early-planted late rice fields are growing very well, with an average of 300,000 to 350,000 plants per mu; the late-planted late rice fields are also thriving these days. Experienced members said: "The color of the rice seedlings at 'Minor Heat' indicates a good harvest!" We believe that the main reason why rice is planted better, more balanced, managed earlier, and more scientifically this year in Songjiang County is that cadres and the masses have given full play to their subjective initiative and consciously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture on the basis of further understanding and mastering the laws of increasing rice production.

So, how can we understand and master the laws of increasing rice production? We have adopted three methods. First, learning: by holding various cadre meetings, member meetings, running training classes, on-site visits, issuing circulars, and other methods, we organize the vast number of cadres and masses to learn agricultural science knowledge, learning while practicing, and gradually understanding and mastering the laws of increasing rice production from the process of learning and practice. For example, after the summer planting, the County Party Committee, based on the experience of agricultural labor model Chen Yongkang's "three yellows and three blacks," concretized it into six characters: "diligence (frequent shallow watering), early (early replanting), quick (quick harrowing), tight (tight weeding), skillful (skillful topdressing), and ruthless (ruthlessly grasp balance, eliminate third-class seedlings)," and carried out large-scale publicity and education. In this way, the level of field management has been greatly improved, achieving fine and specific management, scientific management, and adapting various measures such as irrigation, topdressing, and weeding to the objective laws of the rice tillering stage. Second, summarizing the experiences and lessons of high-yield and low-yield rice fields last year and raising them to a scientific level. Through summary and comparison, everyone realized from the yield difference between this field and that field that high yield can be achieved by doing this, and high yield cannot be achieved by doing that, thereby further understanding the laws of increasing rice production and using them to guide this year's production practice. Third, experimentation: cadres at all levels in the county continue to plant large-scale experimental fields and command fields, and through experimental fields and command fields, drive ten-thousand-mu high-yield fields, and then drive general fields. In this way, experimental fields and command fields become positions for scientific research and experimentation, which is convenient for discovering and utilizing the laws of increasing rice production. In this way, we used the method of "one learning, two summaries, and three experiments" to improve the agricultural science knowledge of grassroots cadres and the vast number of members, and initially grasped the laws of rice growth and development.

The purpose of studying and mastering the laws of increasing rice production is to more correctly exert subjective initiative, control it, and dominate it, truly be the masters of nature, and increase more grain. Therefore, while exploring and initially mastering the laws of increasing rice production, we must also be full of energy, continuously revolutionize, increase measures, and continuously promote, only in this way can we ensure that we obtain a comprehensive high yield of rice.

### 掌握自然规律　指导农业生产

　　掌握自然规律　指导农业生产
　　中共松江县委第一书记　赵仁
    上海市郊松江县95％以上的耕地种水稻，历来耕作比较精细，是一个“稻米之乡”。1958年大跃进以来，全县广大干部和群众在总路线的指导和鼓舞下，已开始注意研究水稻增产规律，探索水稻高产更高产的途径，因而耕作和管理水平进一步有了提高，产量也连年跃进。但是，就全县来说，水稻增产规律还没有为更多的干部和社员所掌握，以致增产幅度不平衡，产量有高有低，高低相差很大。1959年，全县出现了一个水稻全面高产的千斤生产队，还有三万一千九百多亩水稻千斤田，而另一方面，又有很多亩产三、四百斤和五、六百斤的低产田。为什么有的田产量较高，有的较低、有的甚至很低呢？县委认为，这里固然有客观原因，比如土质好坏、地势高低，原来产量基础，等等，但这都不是主要的；主要的还是人们是否掌握了水稻增产规律，以及是否在掌握水稻增产规律的条件下充分发挥了人的主观能动作用。
    基于这样的认识，中共松江县委在今年领导水稻生产中，一开始就充分发动群众，组织全党全民，用对比的方法，总结高产经验，吸取低产教训，达到认识和掌握水稻增产规律的目的。在这个过程中，我们批判了两种思想、两种态度。第一种是从狭隘的历史经验出发看问题，束缚了自己的思想，右倾保守，不敢想、不敢干；第二种是从主观愿望出发，不善于或者不懂得去寻找客观规律，虽然有干劲，但往往事倍功半，得不到预期的效果。县委教育大家：一定要尊重客观规律，并充分发挥主观能动作用，认识和运用客观规律，做大自然的主人。通过这一番教育，大大提高了干部和群众对研究水稻增产规律的积极性，和贯彻“农业八字宪法”的自觉性。
    在统一认识的基础上，县委又发动群众，根据水稻的生长规律，制订了首尾呼应、段段衔接的技术操作规程。具体说来，就是水稻生产“过五关”。哪“五关”？一是准备关：早有心，早动手，把确保水稻增产的一切准备工作，提前在冬春运动中就全部做好。根据松江自然条件的特点，确定以治水、改土、积肥、造肥为重点，大搞水利，大改土壤，大积肥料。二是播种关：在“千斤大计，质量第一”的思想指导下，千方百计，培育壮秧，深耕深翻，施足基肥，合理密植，高标准高质量，打好基础，把三类苗消灭在播种期。三是分蘖关：“黄秧落地，管字当先”。在田间管理中，以“水”、“肥”为中心，合理灌溉，合理追肥，并勤耘勤耥，松土除草，保证每亩水稻田有三十万个左右有效穗。根据我们对一百四十五块水稻千斤田的典型调查，一亩水稻田，在“小暑”“大暑”之间，有了三十万个左右的有效穗，以后再加以促进，达到穗大粒饱，亩产一千斤就很有把握了。四是孕穗关：重施穗肥，掌握水浆，治虫灭病，抗旱抗涝，在穗多的基础上，力争穗大粒多。这一“关”的总目标，是要求长大穗，不长小穗，更不能出现白穗空穗，每个有效穗，至少要有六十粒左右谷子。五是粒重关：根据水稻千斤田的经验，“多打一层水，多长一层皮”，加强后期水浆管理，坚持看苗追肥，对粒饱粒重，有极大的关系。因此，必须按照水稻后期的生长规律，大立不断革命的思想，大破“立秋”定局的思想，做好“最后五分钟”的管理工作，真正做到“作物不收，管理不停”。
    我们深切体会到，按照水稻生长的总的规律和分期分段的具体规律，制订出这样一个统筹全局、分段促进的“过五关”的技术操作规程，是十分必要的。这样做，全季有安排，段段有重点，要求很具体，主攻方向很明确，一个关口又一个关口，一个战役又一个战役，攻打过去，就能永居主动，直到最后胜利。
    在松江县，第一、二两关，已胜利攻破了。全县今年种植七十五万亩水稻，耕作质量普遍比往年好，早种的水稻田和迟种的水稻田，规格质量基本上达到“一个样”，从而改变了往年为了抢季节而出现的“前期精细，后期粗糙”的不平衡状况，这样，就为水稻大面积平衡增产，打下了很好的基础。目前，全县广大干部和社员正以“每亩田有三十万个左右有效穗”为目标，猛攻第三关，也已取得初步胜利。据最近的田间观测，早种的晚稻田，发棵发得很好，每亩一般都有三十万到三十五万棵；迟种的晚稻田，这几天也正在盛发。有经验的社员说：“小暑”禾稻苗有这样的成色，丰收大有苗头啦！我们认为，今年松江县水稻所以种得比较好，比较平衡，管得比较早，比较科学，其主要原因，是干部群众在进一步认识和掌握水稻增产规律的基础上，发挥了充分的主观能动作用，自觉地贯彻执行“农业八字宪法”的缘故。
    那末，怎样才能认识和掌握水稻增产的规律呢？我们采取了三种办法。一是学习，通过召开各种干部会、社员会、举办训练班、现场参观、发通报等方式，组织广大干部群众学习农业科学知识，边学习，边实践，从学习和实践的过程中，逐步认识和掌握水稻的增产规律。如在夏种结束后，县委根据农业劳动模范陈永康运用的“三黄三黑”的经验，具体化为“勤（浅水勤灌）、早（早补苗）、抢
  （抢耥稻）、紧（紧耘稻）、巧（巧追肥）、狠”（狠抓平衡，消灭三类苗）”六个字，并大张旗鼓进行了宣传教育。这样，就大大提高了田间管理水平，做到管得细管得具体，管得科学，使灌溉、追肥、除草等各项措施都适应水稻发棵阶段的客观规律。二是总结去年水稻高产田和低产田的经验教训，上升到科学水平。通过总结对比，使大家从这块田和那块田的产量差别中，认识到这样做就能高产，那样做就不能高产，从而进一步了解水稻增产规律，并用以指导今年的生产实践。三是试验，全县各级干部，继续大种试验田和指挥田，通过试验田和指挥田，带动万亩丰产田，再去带动一般田。这样，试验田和指挥田成了科学研究和试验的阵地，就便于发现和利用水稻的增产规律。就这样，我们运用“一学习、二总结、三试验”的方法，提高了基层干部和广大社员的农业科学知识，初步摸到了水稻的生长发育规律。
    研究和掌握水稻增产规律的目的，是为了更正确地发挥主观能动性，驾驭它，支配它，真正做自然界的主人，增产更多的粮食。因此，在探索和初步掌握了水稻的增产规律的同时，还必须鼓足干劲，不断革命，措施加码，不断促进，只有这样，才能保证获得水稻的全面高产。
