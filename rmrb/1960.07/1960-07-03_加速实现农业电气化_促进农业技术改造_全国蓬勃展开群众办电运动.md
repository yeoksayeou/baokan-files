Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd - A mass movement for self-reliance in electricity, aimed at accelerating agricultural electrification and agricultural technological transformation, is being carried out vigorously across the country. This is a correct path for our people to resolutely implement the Party's "walking on two legs" policy and accelerate the electrification of our rural areas. This movement has already had a significant effect on promoting industrial and agricultural production and improving the people's material and cultural living conditions.

Now, from the inland to the border areas, from the mountains to the plains, power stations and power plants built by urban and rural masses are like stars in the sky. According to statistics from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity and the Ministry of Agriculture, the country has built about 400,000 kilowatts of various power stations, and the number of power plants is even greater. Since the beginning of this year, the mass movement for self-reliance in electricity in rural areas has been developing by leaps and bounds. From January to May this year, Henan Province built more than 77,000 kilowatts of power stations. Now more than 80% of the people's communes in the province have power stations. From January to mid-May this year, Zhejiang Province also built more than 11,000 kilowatts of hydropower stations. If the power of the power stations and hydroelectric stations already established across the country is fully utilized, several million labor forces can be saved. In the first three months of this year, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces also built more than 380 hydropower stations, with a total power generation capacity of more than 9,500 kilowatts; and more than 16,000 hydroelectric stations, with a total function of more than 100,000 horsepower. After the establishment of these power stations and power plants, some of the local heavy manual labor has begun to be replaced by electricity-powered machinery, thereby saving manpower and greatly improving work efficiency. After Jian'an Special District in Jiangxi Province established nearly a thousand small power stations and power plants, 120 kinds of manual labor for processing agricultural and sideline products such as rice hulling, rice milling, sweet potato slicing, feed crushing, soil fertilizer production, oil extraction, sawing boards, papermaking, and food processing have been replaced by more than 5,000 machines powered by electricity. In Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, 84% of the villages have achieved semi-mechanized, mechanized and one-stop automated production in washing, shoe making and sewing; and successfully used electricity to drive machinery to level, harrow, plow, sow, cultivate, harvest and transport in abundant squares. As of March this year, Hongtong County saved a total of more than 40,000 labor forces and more than 20,000 animal power by using electricity. In Yongchun County, Fujian, electric lights were installed in fish ponds to prevent water snakes from preying on fish fry, and to kill insects to satisfy the fish's belly, which achieved remarkable results. In the pastoral area of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region, Gansu, after vigorously developing hydropower, ramie pressing, cement grinding, pulp beating, partial canteen cooking, vegetable cutting, and individual pig farm feeding have all been mechanized and semi-mechanized.

The large-scale mass electricity generation in various places has also, to a certain extent, facilitated or beautified the lives of the masses and promoted cultural and educational undertakings. In Changge County, Henan, most of the communes and production brigades, as well as more than 10,000 commune members' families and nearly a thousand canteens, use electric lights for lighting. After the Jietou Hydropower Station in Wulian County, Shandong, was established, commune members listened quietly to current affairs broadcasts and operas and music under the lights at night. Young people gathered in entertainment venues to perform excellent local entertainment programs. Commune members described the new atmosphere of their lives after setting up power stations with "No lights were seen in the past, and the valleys were dark and secluded. Now there are lights everywhere at night, and the valleys have become cities that never sleep."

The widespread and in-depth development of the mass electricity generation movement has enabled the broad masses to accept and master a lot of scientific and technical knowledge related to electricity. Within a year of running electricity in Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, a team familiar with electrical technology has been trained, capable of designing and constructing, and producing complete sets of electric generators, blowers, and transformers. Since the launch of the mass electricity generation movement in Henan Province, tens of thousands of people have been trained in electricity generation.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, various localities have accumulated a lot of experience in the mass electricity generation movement. Henan Province, in particular, has achieved remarkable achievements in the mass electricity generation throughout the province, and has explored a series of valuable experiences in equipment manufacturing, technical force training, power station construction, operation and management.

At the National Rural Mass Electricity Generation Experience Exchange Conference recently held in Zhengzhou by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity and the Ministry of Agriculture, the experience of Henan mass electricity generation was emphasized, and 97 mass electricity generation experiences were selected from more than 200 experiences across the country to form nine "dragons" including hydropower station construction, water turbine and motor manufacturing, power distribution equipment, thermal power station and internal combustion engine station, hydraulic processing machinery, operation and management, and personnel training. It is required that all localities systematically promote them in accordance with local conditions to accelerate the progress of the mass electricity generation movement. (Photo attached)

    加速实现农业电气化  促进农业技术改造
    全国蓬勃展开群众办电运动
    新华社郑州2日电　一个加速实现农业电气化和农业技术改造的群众办电运动正在全国各地轰轰烈烈地开展着。这是我国人民坚决贯彻执行党的“两条腿走路”方针，加速我国农村电气化的一条正确的途径。这个运动，对促进工农业生产和改善人民物质文化生活条件，已经发生了显著的作用。
    现在，从内地到边疆，从山区到平原，城乡群众兴办的电力站、动力站犹如满天星斗。据水利电力部和农业部统计，全国已建成各种电力站四十万瓩左右，动力站为数更多。今年以来，农村群众办电运动更是一日千里、日新月异地向前发展了。河南省今年1月到5月份，就建成电力站七万七千多瓩，现在全省已有80％以上的人民公社有了电站。浙江省今年1月到5月中旬也建成水电站一万一千多瓩。如果充分利用全国已经建立起来的电站和水力站的动力，就可以节约好几百万个劳动力。福建、浙江两省今年头三个月也建成水电站三百八十余处，发电能力共九千五百多瓩；建成水力站一万六千余处，功能共十万多马力。这些电站和动力站建立后，已开始使当地的一些笨重体力劳动，由电作动力的一些机械所代替，从而节省了人力，大大提高了工效。江西吉安专区在建立了近千座小电站和动力站后，砻谷、碾米、红薯切片、饲料粉碎、制土化肥、榨油、锯板、造纸、食品加工等一百二十种农副产品加工的手工劳动，已被由电力作动力的五千多台机器所代替。山西洪洞县84％的村庄，在洗衣、制鞋、缝纫都实现了半机械化、机械化和一条龙自动化的生产；并在丰产方内成功地试用了电力带动机械来平地、耙地、耕地、播种、中耕、收割、运输。截至今年3月，洪洞县用电力共节省了四万多个劳力和两万多个畜力。福建永春县，把电灯安入鱼池，防止了水蛇侵食鱼苗，同时诱杀虫子，以饱鱼腹，收到了卓著功效。甘肃草原地带的天祝藏族自治区，在大办水电后，压麻、碾水泥、打纸浆、部分食堂做饭、切菜以及个别养猪场的饲养工作，都实现了机械化、半机械化。
    各地大搞群众办电，在一定程度上还方便或美化了群众的生活，促进了文化教育事业。河南长葛县绝大部分公社和生产大队，以及一万多户社员家庭，近千个食堂，都使用了电灯照明。山东五莲县街头水电站建立后，夜晚社员们在灯光下静听时事广播和戏曲、音乐。年轻的人们聚集在娱乐场所表演当地的优秀游艺节目。社员们以“昔日夜晚不见灯，山谷僻岭黑洞洞，今日夜晚到处明，山谷变成不夜城”，来描述他们办起电站以后生活的新气象。
    群众办电运动广泛深入的开展，使广大群众接受和掌握了不少有关电的科学技术知识。陕西盩厔县在办电一年内，已经培养出了一支熟悉电气技术的队伍，能设计施工，能生产成套的电动发电机、鼓风机、变压器。河南省开展群众办电运动以来训练出来的办电人材已达几万人。
    建国以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，各地在群众办电运动中都积累了不少的经验，特别是在全省范围内群众办电获得显著成就的河南省，从制造设备、培养技术力量、电站建设到运行管理等方面，都摸索出了一系列的宝贵经验。
    水利电力部和农业部最近在郑州召开的全国农村群众办电经验交流会上，着重介绍了河南群众办电的经验，并且从全国的二百多项经验中挑选了九十七项群众办电的经验，配套成水电站建设、水轮机和电机制造、配电设备、火电站及内燃机站、水力加工机械、经营管理、人员培训等九条龙，要求各地系统地因地制宜地推广，加速群众办电运动的进度。（附图片）
