    Fight Natural Disasters to the End
    A heroic battle against natural disasters and to conquer natural disasters is continuously being waged in many regions of our country. "The devil rises one foot, the Dao rises ten." Although the drought demon is very arrogant, it has to bow its head again and again before the heroic members of the people's communes. Last year, there was a severe drought for more than half a year, but there was still a good harvest in the autumn. Then there was another drought for half a year, and most areas still increased production this summer; although some areas had the same production level or reduced production, they still increased production compared with the general years or disaster-stricken years before the Great Leap Forward. If such a severe drought had occurred before liberation, it would have resulted in barren land and no harvest. Despite the drought, the area of spring sowing was expanded this year, and summer sowing is also progressing rapidly. This is another great victory in the fight against drought. The current serious task is to continue fighting drought and seize the time to plant, and persist in fighting drought to protect seedlings, without slackening for even half a day, and strive for another great autumn harvest. Fight drought as long as the drought lasts. At the same time, pay close attention to other natural disasters, and do not allow them to succeed, whether it is flooding or pests and diseases. In Guangdong and Fujian, which recently suffered from typhoon and flood disasters, cadres and the masses are full of vigor and confidence, and are determined to "recover every point of loss! Replant every lost mu!" "Take back from the late rice what was lost from the early rice! Take back from coarse grains what was lost from paddy fields!" People in all areas threatened by natural disasters should have such heroic spirit. We must turn natural disasters into the driving force for transforming nature, turn bad things into good things, and transform negative factors into positive factors, mobilize the strength of the whole people to participate in this struggle, and further and more rapidly improve agricultural production, which is the foundation of the national economy, in the struggle.
    The large-scale disaster relief struggle of the Chinese people in recent years has most clearly proved the truth that "strategically we must despise difficulties, and tactically we must pay attention to difficulties." As long as we fight bravely, we will surely find ways to overcome difficulties; as long as we find ways, we can more powerfully arouse the courage to overcome difficulties. The combination of revolutionary vigor and a realistic spirit will be invincible and all-conquering. When the masses have not been mobilized, and in places where the struggle has not yet begun, the difficulties seem to be so many: the terrain is not good, there is no water source, there is a shortage of labor, there is a lack of machinery, and so on. Once the masses are mobilized and the struggle begins, the same difficulties become insignificant in the face of the people. The more severe the drought, the worse the natural conditions, the greater the people's enthusiasm for fighting nature. Since the fight against drought began last summer, the various water conservancy projects newly built in various parts of Henan Province can expand the irrigated area to several times the irrigated area before liberation; at the same time, they have also improved the large number of irrigation projects built in the previous years. In the places where many people never thought there would be water, water was found in the struggle against drought. In the large-scale struggle to develop water sources, people have further mastered the laws of movement of surface water and groundwater in various regions. If the existing surface water is not enough, mountain springs are dug, and if there are no mountain springs, wells are drilled. If small wells are not enough, large wells are drilled, and if shallow wells are not enough, they are dug deeper. In the Loess Plateau of Longdong area, Gansu, at an altitude of 1,500 meters, hundreds of thousands of deep wells were drilled in a few months, and many wells were connected in series to form open channels and underground passages, forming a huge underground river network. During the recent drought resistance period in northern Jin, a large number of high-altitude irrigation projects were completed, increasing the irrigated area by 30%; and many methods of rational water use were created, so that most of the drought-stricken land was planted with crops in a timely manner. In many places, in order to divert water for irrigation, people have chiseled tunnels in thousand-foot-thick stone mountains, and built aqueducts on cliffs dozens of feet high. Stone is hard, this is an objective existence; there is a strong will harder than stone in the world, this is also an objective existence. "Drought resistance produces science," which is not wrong at all. Science has always developed in the struggle between man and nature; the more intense the struggle, the faster science develops. Historical materialism tells us that it is the actual needs of social production development that promote science. The many innovations of the people in the fight against drought have not only enriched water conservancy science, but have also created many methods of drought-resistant planting, rational water use, and application of power. In all places where victories have been achieved in the fight against drought, there is not only soaring enthusiasm and a lively atmosphere, but also hard work and ingenuity, and practicality and meticulousness. Here, the revolutionary will of the proletariat and the pragmatic spirit of dialectical materialism play a decisive role.
    In the large-scale struggle against drought, the power of the people's communes has been fully demonstrated, especially the power of large-scale cooperation, which represents the spirit of the era of the people's communes. When one place is in trouble, help comes from all directions. The units within each commune support each other, and the regions and departments also help each other in times of difficulty. Among the broad masses of the people, "leave the difficulties to ourselves and give the convenience to others" has become a social trend. What could not be done for thousands of years is now being done, and what was once considered a dream has become a reality. One of the most fundamental reasons for this is this. In the struggle against drought in Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, eight communes cooperated to dig five large canals with a total length of 120 kilometers, connecting the four rivers in the county, so that the utilization rate of water increased from 40% in the past to 70%. Shexian County, Hebei Province, planted 360,000 mu of wheat, and the original water conservancy could only irrigate 50,000 mu; when the wheat was withering and urgently needed watering, a county-wide large-scale cooperation was organized, channels were built through mountains and across ravines, and a large number of water lifting tools were mobilized to draw water to the mountain slopes more than 20 feet high, so that 230,000 mu of drought-stricken wheat was watered, and finally a good harvest was obtained. Many areas have made unified plans for surface water and groundwater, areas with soil moisture and areas without soil moisture, and tried every means to divert the existing water sources to the places that need water most, with mutual assistance and concessions between upstream and downstream, and left and right banks, and the water disputes of many years have been swept away. Many industrial departments not only support drought resistance with their own products, but also send a large number of technical workers to the forefront of drought resistance. Areas that are not drought-stricken or have lighter drought conditions also send a lot of manpower and material resources to support areas with heavier drought conditions. The "logistics" departments of many people's communes in drought-stricken areas are even more wholeheartedly serving the drought-resistant army, and public canteens and various collective welfare undertakings are getting better and better, which has played a huge role in ensuring the victory of the drought resistance struggle. It is precisely because the spirit of communism and collectivism has been highly promoted that hundreds of millions of working people have formed a whole, and people have begun to take the initiative in mastering nature. In the struggle against disasters, the ideological level of the broad masses of the people and cadres has been rapidly improved. The revolutionary spirit of collectivism and the fighting world outlook have been established in the minds of most people, and the territory of individualism, idlers, and cowards' world outlook has been greatly reduced.
    In the fight against drought, it has also been invariably proved that: to most quickly and forcefully open up the situation of drought resistance and win the victory of the struggle, leading cadres must go to the forefront of drought resistance, to the most difficult places, and grasp the weakest links. Drought resistance and flood resistance such struggles do not allow any bureaucracy. We must do what we say, and we must go to the actual struggle to do it with the masses. Zhang Jianmin, the first secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province, went to Tangyin and Junxian counties, which were severely affected by the drought, and together with the grassroots cadres and commune members, studied the drought resistance plan for the Huolonggang, which had 230,000 mu of land and was most severely affected by the drought, found specific ways to dig mountain springs, find water sources, divert water to the mountains, and seize the time to plant drought-resistant crops, and immediately concentrated leadership and manpower and material resources to do it vigorously. In the past, many people thought that it was impossible to find water on Huolonggang at all. Now, they have not only found 154 mountain springs, but also dug 11 large groups of springs on the top of the hill, with a total of more than four traffic flow. In this way, the situation of drought resistance and seizing the time to plant crops was quickly opened up. Throughout the country, many county party secretaries and commune party secretaries have joined the masses in climbing mountains and ridges, looking for spring sources, surveying channels, and mobilizing the masses to attack water conservancy "dead ends," bringing water to the places that are most in need of water. As long as the leading cadres go to the forefront of drought resistance and personally get involved, the problem of incomplete sets of water conservancy equipment, and the use and repair problems of new irrigation machinery will be quickly discovered and quickly solved.
    Now, the fight against drought has entered a more arduous stage. On the one hand, due to the long drought, the flow of many large rivers has been greatly reduced, many small rivers have been cut off, the water storage capacity of reservoirs and ponds has been decreasing day by day, and the groundwater level has been continuously decreasing; on the other hand, the later it gets, the places where the task of drought resistance, seizing the time to plant crops, and protecting seedlings has not been completed are mostly the most difficult places. We must carry forward a stronger fighting spirit, prepare to meet greater difficulties, and be determined to overcome greater difficulties. In places that have not been affected by the drought, we must not be paralyzed. We must resist the drought as soon as a drought sign appears. Places where a long drought is met with timely rain cannot be neglected either. A rainstorm cannot solve the problem of a severe drought, and it may be drought again after the rain. We must turn the bad thing of drought into a good thing, and we must never let the good thing of rain turn into a bad thing. In all drought-stricken areas, the leadership should concentrate its main strength to lead the fight against drought. In places affected by other natural disasters, we must also put the greatest effort into the disaster relief struggle. Disaster-free areas should not only prevent disasters, but also do their best to support disaster-stricken areas. In addition to directly supporting with manpower and material resources, we must also strive to make up for the losses in disaster areas by increasing production and practicing economy. The 650 million people are a whole, sharing blessings and sharing difficulties. As long as we unite and fight natural disasters to the end under the leadership of the Party, we will surely achieve greater victories.

    同自然灾害斗争到底
    一场抗拒自然灾害征服自然灾害的英勇的战斗，正在我国许多地区持续进行。“魔高一尺，道高一丈”。尽管旱魔气焰很高，在英雄的人民公社社员面前它却不得不一次又一次低头。去年旱了大半年，秋季还是好收成。接着又旱了半年，今年夏季大部地区仍然增产；部分地区虽然是平产或减产，但同大跃进以前一般年成或受灾年份相比还是增产。像这样严重的旱情，如果在解放前，就只能是赤地千里、颗粒无收。在干旱的情况下，今年春播面积扩大了，夏播也在迅速进展，这是抗旱斗争的又一次大胜利。目前的严重任务是继续抗旱抢种，坚持抗旱保苗，半天也不松懈地斗争下去，夺取再一次秋季大丰收。旱到什么时候，就抗到什么时候。同时，严密地注意其它自然灾害，不论是水涝是病虫，都不让它得逞。在广东、福建不久以前遭受台风洪水灾害的地区，干部群众朝气勃勃，信心百倍，下定决心“损失一分，夺回一分！损失一亩，扩种一亩！”“从早造失去的，从晚造拿回来！从水田失去的，从杂粮拿回来！”一切受到自然灾害威胁的地区的人们，都应当有这样的英雄气概。一定要把自然灾害变成改造自然的动力，变坏事为好事，化消极因素为积极因素，动员全民的力量参加这场斗争，在斗争中把作为国民经济的基础的农业生产更迅速地提高一步。
    近几年我国人民的大规模的抗灾斗争，最清楚不过地证明了“战略上必须藐视困难，战术上必须重视困难”的真理。只要勇敢斗争，就一定能找到征服困难的办法；只要找出办法，就能更有力地鼓起征服困难的勇气。革命干劲和实事求是的精神相结合，就能所向披靡，无往不利。在群众还没有发动起来的时候，在斗争还没有展开的地方，困难似乎是那么多，地势不好啊，没有水源啊，缺少劳力啊，缺少机具啊，不一而足。群众一经发动，斗争一经展开，同样的困难，在人们面前却变得渺小了。越是旱得厉害的地方，越是自然条件不好的地方，人们同自然作斗争的干劲越大。去年夏季抗旱以来，河南省各地新修的各种水利工程可以扩大的灌溉面积相当于解放前的灌溉面积的好几倍；同时还改善了前几年兴修的大量的灌溉工程。许多人从来认为不会有水的地方，在抗旱斗争中把水找了出来。在大规模开发水源的斗争中，人们进一步掌握了各种不同地区地面水和地下水的运动规律。现有的地面水不够就挖山泉，没有山泉的地方就打井。小井不行打大井，浅井不行再深挖。甘肃陇东地区海拔一千五百米的黄土高原上，几个月里凿了十几万眼深井，有很多井是井井串连修成明渠暗道，组成巨大的地下河网。晋北地区最近抗旱期间完成了大量的高地灌溉工程，使灌溉面积扩大30％；并且创造了许多合理用水的方法，使大部分受旱的土地适时地种上了庄稼。在许多地方，为了引水浇地，人们在千尺厚的石山上凿成了隧洞，在几十丈高的山崖上架起了渡槽。石头是硬的，这是客观存在；世界上有比石头更硬的坚强的意志，这也是客观存在。“抗旱出科学”，一点也不错。科学从来是在人和自然的斗争中发展起来的；越是斗争激烈的时候，科学就发展得越快。历史唯物论告诉我们，正是社会生产发展的实际需要推进了科学。人民群众在抗旱斗争中的许多创举，不仅丰富了水利科学，还创造了许多抗旱栽种的方法、合理用水的方法和运用动力的方法。凡是在抗旱斗争中取得了胜利的地方，既是干劲冲天，热气腾腾，又是苦干巧干，踏实细致。在这里，无产阶级的革命意志和辩证唯物主义的实事求是精神就起着决定性的作用。
    在大规模的抗旱斗争中，充分显示出来了人民公社的威力，特别是显示出来了代表着人民公社时代精神的大协作的威力。一处有难，八方支援。各个公社内部的各单位互相支持，各地区、各部门之间也患难相助。在广大群众中间，“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”已经成为社会风尚。千百年来办不到的事情现在办到了，一向认为是梦想的事情变成了现实，最根本的原因之一就在于此。山西忻县在抗旱斗争中，八个公社大协作，挖了五条长达一百二十公里的大渠，把县境内的四条河水连在一起，使水的利用率由过去的40％提高到70％。河北涉县种了三十六万亩小麦，原有水利只能浇五万亩；在小麦枯黄急需浇水的时候，组织了全县范围的大协作，穿山越沟大修渠道，调动大批提水工具，把水引上二十多丈高的山坡，使二十三万亩受旱的小麦浇上了水，终于得到丰收。许多地区对地上水和地下水、有墒地区和无墒地区，进行了统一规划，千方百计把现有水源引向最需要水的地方，上下游、左右岸互助互让，多年来的争水纠纷一扫而光。许多工业部门不只以自己的产品支援抗旱，还抽调大批技术工人到抗旱的最前线去。不旱或旱情较轻的地区，也抽调许多人力物力支援旱情较重的地区。受旱地区很多人民公社的“后勤”部门，更是一心一意为抗旱大军服务，公共食堂和各项集体福利事业，办得越来越好，对于保证抗旱斗争的胜利起了巨大的作用。正因为高度发扬了共产主义、集体主义精神，成千成万成亿的劳动人民结成一个整体，人们开始对大自然掌握了主动权。在抗灾斗争中迅速地提高了广大群众和干部的思想水平。集体主义的革命精神和战斗的世界观在大多数人的思想中树立起来，个人主义的、懒汉和懦夫的世界观的地盘大大地缩小了。
    在抗旱斗争中，还无例外地证明了：要最迅速最有力地打开抗旱的局面，取得斗争的胜利，领导干部必须到抗旱的最前线，到最困难的地方，抓最薄弱的环节。抗旱、抗洪这样的斗争，不容许有一点官僚主义。必须说了就干，而且要到实际斗争中去同群众一起大干。河南新乡地委第一书记张健民到旱情严重的汤阴、浚县，同基层干部和社员群众一起，研究了有二十三万亩地的受旱最厉害的火龙岗的抗旱计划，找出了挖山泉、找水源、引水上山、抗旱抢种的具体办法，立即集中领导力量和人力、物力大干起来。过去，许多人认为在火龙岗上根本找不到水，现在，他们不但找出了一百五十四个山泉，而且在岗顶挖出十一个大群泉，共有四个多流量。这样一来，抗旱抢种的局面很快地就打开了。在全国各地，许多县委书记、公社党委书记同群众一起翻山越岭，寻找泉源，勘测渠道，发动群众猛攻水利“死角”，为最缺水、最需要水的地方引来了水。只要领导干部到了抗旱最前线，亲自动手干，水利设备没有配套的问题，新式灌溉机具的使用、修理问题，很快就发现了，很快就解决了。
    现在，抗旱斗争已经进入更艰苦的阶段。一方面，由于旱得太久，许多大河流量大减，许多小河已经断流，水库水塘蓄水量日渐减少，地下水位不断下降；另方面，越到后来，还没有完成抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗的任务的地方，大都是条件最困难的地方。必须发扬更坚强的斗志，准备迎接更大的困难，决心战胜更大的困难。在没有受旱的地方也不能麻痹，旱象一露头就要抗。久旱逢甘霖的地方同样不能疏忽，一场雨并不能解决大旱的问题，而且雨后还可能再旱。一定要把干旱这件坏事变成好事，千万不可让下雨这件好事变成坏事。在一切受旱的地区，领导方面要集中主要力量，领导抗旱斗争。在受到其他自然灾害的地方，也要用最大的力量投入抗灾斗争。无灾地区要一面防灾，一面尽力支援受灾地区。除了直接以人力物力支援之外，还要从增加生产和厉行节约两个方面努力，力求弥补灾区的损失。六亿五千万人民是一个整体，有福同享，有难同当。只要在党的领导下团结一致，对自然灾害斗争到底，我们一定能够取得更大的胜利。
