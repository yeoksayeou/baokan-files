Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally lodged a note with the Indonesian government regarding the bloody incident on July 3, 1960, in Tjimahi, West Java, Indonesia, where local military forces shot and killed overseas Chinese women, and has issued a strong protest. The Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people and the vast number of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people fully support the solemn stance taken by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its note to the Indonesian government.

The West Java military authorities dispatched troops to Tjimahi to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese, and in the process, opened fire, resulting in the deaths of two overseas Chinese women and injuries to several others. This is an extremely serious incident in the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. However, after the Tjimahi incident, the forces in Indonesia that are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship have not only shown no intention of expressing any remorse but have also tried their best to distort the truth, deny the crime of shooting overseas Chinese, and even make counter-accusations, attempting to shift the responsibility for the bloody incident onto the overseas Chinese. Sunarjo, the head of the Indonesian Central Intelligence Bureau, insisted that the "activities" of the overseas Chinese were "very irresponsible." Lieutenant Colonel Nawawi Alif, the press officer of the Indonesian Sixth Military Region, fabricated facts to such a clumsy extent that in the same statement, he said first that "the overseas Chinese picked up wood and stones to beat the army and police, so the army and police opened fire," and then that "it was not the military police who intentionally opened fire, but the firearms went off accidentally, and the reason for the accidental discharge was that these overseas Chinese snatched the firearms." It is not difficult for people to see that since the army did "open fire," how can it be described as an "accidental discharge"? Can the bloody truth be covered up by self-contradictory explanations? The West Java military authorities cannot escape their guilt for killing innocent overseas Chinese.

As everyone knows, thanks to a series of major efforts made by the Chinese government and people to safeguard the friendship between the two countries, and also thanks to the cooperation of the Indonesian side, some progress has been made in the comprehensive settlement of the overseas Chinese issue between China and Indonesia. After the joint communiqu√© issued by our Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio in October last year, the Chinese and Indonesian governments exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on the issue of dual nationality and established a joint committee to implement the treaty. The Chinese government later took the initiative to send ships to pick up those overseas Chinese who could not make a living due to forced relocation. The committee for implementing the dual nationality treaty between China and Indonesia has held eighteen meetings so far and has reached some preliminary agreements. Although the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia have not stopped, with the joint efforts of the people of the two countries, the tension between the two countries caused by the overseas Chinese issue has shown some signs of easing. It was hoped that through the continued efforts of both China and Indonesia, the overseas Chinese issue would be gradually resolved, and the friendly relations between China and Indonesia would be maintained and developed.

However, a small handful of forces in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship are obviously unwilling to see a quick and comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, and even less willing to see the development of friendly relations between China and Indonesia. They have created a series of unfortunate incidents one after another. In April this year, the inspection authorities dispatched armed personnel to hijack our ship "Da Baokang," which was sent to pick up overseas Chinese, in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, Indonesia. In Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, the local military authorities forcibly placed Jiang Yan, our consul stationed in Banjarmasin, who went to the area to assist in handling the repatriation of distressed overseas Chinese, under house arrest. Since late May, the West Java military authorities have carried out a second large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese, using various barbaric means such as arrests, summons, beatings, cutting off residential water and electricity supplies, and sealing houses and property. And now, the Tjimahi bloody incident has occurred. These facts show that a small handful of people with ulterior motives in Indonesia have consistently and deliberately provoked incidents, expanded the situation, and tried to obstruct the reasonable settlement of the overseas Chinese issue and poison the relations between China and Indonesia, in order to achieve their dirty goals of pleasing U.S. imperialism externally and attacking patriotic democratic forces and all dissidents internally.

Obviously, the criminal activities of this small handful of people in Indonesia directly violate the promises and friendly wishes repeatedly expressed by the Indonesian government. The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia have repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government, demanding that it protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and stop the forced relocation and all persecution activities against overseas Chinese. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio clearly stated in his reply to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on March 26, 1960, that the Indonesian government had implemented the Chinese government's request to stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese. Foreign Minister Subandrio also said in his letter that the overseas Chinese issue "can only be resolved if both parties handle it with a cautious attitude" and that "a friendly atmosphere must be the guiding principle for resolving this difficult issue." Of course, the Chinese government and people are willing to see these friendly expressions of the Indonesian government fully realized, in order to benefit the friendly relations between the two countries. However, the occurrence of events similar to the forced relocation in West Java and the massacre of overseas Chinese in Tjimahi is not in line with these friendly expressions of the Indonesian government.

A small handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship vainly hope to make the Indonesian people believe that as long as they please U.S. imperialism, it will bring benefits to Indonesia. However, the eyes of the people are discerning. Because facts educate the Indonesian people: U.S. weapons have been continuously strengthening the Dutch colonial army that occupies West Irian, which is Indonesian territory; supporting the Dutch colonialists' military provocations against Indonesia and their long-term occupation of West Irian. Is this policy of pleasing U.S. imperialism in line with Indonesia's national interests?

The Chinese people fully understand that the small handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship, the planners of the Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese, can never represent the broad masses of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people are friendly to the Chinese people. For generations, the vast number of overseas Chinese have worked diligently on Indonesian soil and have formed close friendships with the Indonesian people. When overseas Chinese were subjected to innocent persecution, the Indonesian people, and even many local officials, junior officers, police, and soldiers, expressed their deep sympathy and gave them enthusiastic help. Many Indonesian friends bid farewell to the returning overseas Chinese, expressing their deep friendship with the Chinese people. After the Tjimahi incident, not only overseas Chinese but also many Indonesian friends went to mourn the dead. It can be seen that people from broad strata of Indonesian society are opposed to anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and this small handful of reactionary elements who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship are extremely isolated among the Indonesian people. The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people cannot be shaken by any reactionary forces. Despite the occurrence of anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia, and even the bloody Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese, the Chinese people have always cherished and maintained the deep friendship established between the people of the two countries in the long-term common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have given, are giving, and will continue to give firm support to the Indonesian people's just struggle against the Dutch colonialists' occupation of West Irian.

On the overseas Chinese issue, the Chinese government has always proceeded, and still proceeds, from the desire to maintain the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and advocates seeking a comprehensive and reasonable solution through friendly consultation in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. However, precisely in order to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries, the Chinese government, in its note to the Indonesian government on the Tjimahi incident, firmly demanded that the Indonesian government issue a public apology for this incident, severely punish the murderers of the overseas Chinese in Tjimahi, provide compensation to the families of the dead overseas Chinese, bear the medical expenses of the injured overseas Chinese and compensate them for their losses, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, and immediately take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The Chinese government also demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the forced relocation and various persecution activities against overseas Chinese. All these demands of the Chinese government are reasonable and justified. We expect that the Indonesian government will also make a wise response from the desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries. We hope that the Indonesian government can actively remove obstacles and work together with the Chinese government to seek a comprehensive and reasonable solution to the overseas Chinese issue existing between our two countries, in order to maintain and develop the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and to benefit peace in Asia and the world.
