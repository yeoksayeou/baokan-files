Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally lodged a note with the Indonesian government regarding the bloody incident on July 3, 1960, in Tjimahi, West Java, Indonesia, where local military forces shot and killed overseas Chinese women, and has issued a strong protest. The Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people and the vast number of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people fully support the solemn stance taken by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its note to the Indonesian government.

The West Java military authorities dispatched troops to Tjimahi to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese, and in the process, opened fire, resulting in the deaths of two overseas Chinese women and injuries to several others. This is an extremely serious incident in the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. However, after the Tjimahi incident, the forces in Indonesia that are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship have not only shown no intention of expressing any remorse but have also tried their best to distort the truth, deny the crime of shooting overseas Chinese, and even make counter-accusations, attempting to shift the responsibility for the bloody incident onto the overseas Chinese. Sunarjo, the head of the Indonesian Central Intelligence Bureau, insisted that the "activities" of the overseas Chinese were "very irresponsible." Lieutenant Colonel Nawawi Alif, the press officer of the Indonesian Sixth Military Region, fabricated facts to such a clumsy extent that in the same statement, he said first that "the overseas Chinese picked up wood and stones to beat the army and police, so the army and police opened fire," and then that "it was not the military police who intentionally opened fire, but the firearms went off accidentally, and the reason for the accidental discharge was that these overseas Chinese snatched the firearms." It is not difficult for people to see that since the army did "open fire," how can it be described as an "accidental discharge"? Can the bloody truth be covered up by self-contradictory explanations? The West Java military authorities cannot escape their guilt for killing innocent overseas Chinese.

As everyone knows, thanks to a series of major efforts made by the Chinese government and people to safeguard the friendship between the two countries, and also thanks to the cooperation of the Indonesian side, some progress has been made in the comprehensive settlement of the overseas Chinese issue between China and Indonesia. After the joint communiqué issued by our Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio in October last year, the Chinese and Indonesian governments exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on the issue of dual nationality and established a joint committee to implement the treaty. The Chinese government later took the initiative to send ships to pick up those overseas Chinese who could not make a living due to forced relocation. The committee for implementing the dual nationality treaty between China and Indonesia has held eighteen meetings so far and has reached some preliminary agreements. Although the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia have not stopped, with the joint efforts of the people of the two countries, the tension between the two countries caused by the overseas Chinese issue has shown some signs of easing. It was hoped that through the continued efforts of both China and Indonesia, the overseas Chinese issue would be gradually resolved, and the friendly relations between China and Indonesia would be maintained and developed.

However, a small handful of forces in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship are obviously unwilling to see a quick and comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, and even less willing to see the development of friendly relations between China and Indonesia. They have created a series of unfortunate incidents one after another. In April this year, the inspection authorities dispatched armed personnel to hijack our ship "Da Baokang," which was sent to pick up overseas Chinese, in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, Indonesia. In Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, the local military authorities forcibly placed Jiang Yan, our consul stationed in Banjarmasin, who went to the area to assist in handling the repatriation of distressed overseas Chinese, under house arrest. Since late May, the West Java military authorities have carried out a second large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese, using various barbaric means such as arrests, summons, beatings, cutting off residential water and electricity supplies, and sealing houses and property. And now, the Tjimahi bloody incident has occurred. These facts show that a small handful of people with ulterior motives in Indonesia have consistently and deliberately provoked incidents, expanded the situation, and tried to obstruct the reasonable settlement of the overseas Chinese issue and poison the relations between China and Indonesia, in order to achieve their dirty goals of pleasing U.S. imperialism externally and attacking patriotic democratic forces and all dissidents internally.

Obviously, the criminal activities of this small handful of people in Indonesia directly violate the promises and friendly wishes repeatedly expressed by the Indonesian government. The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia have repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government, demanding that it protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and stop the forced relocation and all persecution activities against overseas Chinese. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio clearly stated in his reply to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on March 26, 1960, that the Indonesian government had implemented the Chinese government's request to stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese. Foreign Minister Subandrio also said in his letter that the overseas Chinese issue "can only be resolved if both parties handle it with a cautious attitude" and that "a friendly atmosphere must be the guiding principle for resolving this difficult issue." Of course, the Chinese government and people are willing to see these friendly expressions of the Indonesian government fully realized, in order to benefit the friendly relations between the two countries. However, the occurrence of events similar to the forced relocation in West Java and the massacre of overseas Chinese in Tjimahi is not in line with these friendly expressions of the Indonesian government.

A small handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship vainly hope to make the Indonesian people believe that as long as they please U.S. imperialism, it will bring benefits to Indonesia. However, the eyes of the people are discerning. Because facts educate the Indonesian people: U.S. weapons have been continuously strengthening the Dutch colonial army that occupies West Irian, which is Indonesian territory; supporting the Dutch colonialists' military provocations against Indonesia and their long-term occupation of West Irian. Is this policy of pleasing U.S. imperialism in line with Indonesia's national interests?

The Chinese people fully understand that the small handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship, the planners of the Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese, can never represent the broad masses of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people are friendly to the Chinese people. For generations, the vast number of overseas Chinese have worked diligently on Indonesian soil and have formed close friendships with the Indonesian people. When overseas Chinese were subjected to innocent persecution, the Indonesian people, and even many local officials, junior officers, police, and soldiers, expressed their deep sympathy and gave them enthusiastic help. Many Indonesian friends bid farewell to the returning overseas Chinese, expressing their deep friendship with the Chinese people. After the Tjimahi incident, not only overseas Chinese but also many Indonesian friends went to mourn the dead. It can be seen that people from broad strata of Indonesian society are opposed to anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and this small handful of reactionary elements who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship are extremely isolated among the Indonesian people. The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people cannot be shaken by any reactionary forces. Despite the occurrence of anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia, and even the bloody Tjimahi massacre of overseas Chinese, the Chinese people have always cherished and maintained the deep friendship established between the people of the two countries in the long-term common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have given, are giving, and will continue to give firm support to the Indonesian people's just struggle against the Dutch colonialists' occupation of West Irian.

On the overseas Chinese issue, the Chinese government has always proceeded, and still proceeds, from the desire to maintain the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and advocates seeking a comprehensive and reasonable solution through friendly consultation in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. However, precisely in order to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries, the Chinese government, in its note to the Indonesian government on the Tjimahi incident, firmly demanded that the Indonesian government issue a public apology for this incident, severely punish the murderers of the overseas Chinese in Tjimahi, provide compensation to the families of the dead overseas Chinese, bear the medical expenses of the injured overseas Chinese and compensate them for their losses, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, and immediately take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The Chinese government also demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the forced relocation and various persecution activities against overseas Chinese. All these demands of the Chinese government are reasonable and justified. We expect that the Indonesian government will also make a wise response from the desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries. We hope that the Indonesian government can actively remove obstacles and work together with the Chinese government to seek a comprehensive and reasonable solution to the overseas Chinese issue existing between our two countries, in order to maintain and develop the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and to benefit peace in Asia and the world.

### 维护中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系

　　维护中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系
    我国外交部已就1960年7月3日印度尼西亚西爪哇芝马圩地方发生的军队枪杀华侨妇女的流血惨案正式照会印度尼西亚政府，并且提出了强硬的抗议。芝马圩惨杀华侨事件，已经激起了中国人民和广大华侨的极大愤慨。中国人民完全支持我国外交部在致印度尼西亚政府照会中所采取的严正立场。
    西爪哇军事当局派遣军队到芝马圩地方，对华侨实行武力逼迁，并且在逼迁中开枪射击，造成两名华侨妇女死亡，多名华侨受伤的流血事件。这是在印度尼西亚反华排华活动中出现的一次极为严重的事件。但是，在芝马圩事件发生之后，印度尼西亚敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力，不仅无意对此表示任何歉意，反而竭力歪曲事实真相，抵赖枪杀华侨的罪行，甚至反咬一口，妄图把造成流血惨案的责任推到华侨身上。印度尼西亚中央情报部负责人苏纳约硬说华侨的“活动”是“很不负责的”。印度尼西亚第六军区司令新闻官纳瓦维·阿利夫中校编造事实竟到如此拙劣的地步，他在同一次谈话中，一会儿说什么“华侨拾起木头和石块殴打军队和警察，所以军队和警察才会开枪”；一会儿又说什么“不是军警有意开枪射击，而是军械走火，而走火的原因，是这些华侨抢夺军械所造成的结果”。人们不难看出，既然军队“开枪”射击确有其事，那么又怎么能够推说是“军械走火”呢？血的事实，岂是自相矛盾的辩解所能掩盖得了的吗？西爪哇军事当局是无论如何也不能逃脱它杀害无辜华侨的罪责的。
    大家知道，由于中国政府和人民从维护两国的友谊出发，作了一系列重大的努力，也由于印度尼西亚方面的合作，存在于中国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题的全面解决，已经有了某些进展。去年10月间我国外交部长陈毅和印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约发表了会谈联合公报之后，中国和印度尼西亚政府互换了关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，成立了实施这个条约的联合委员会。中国政府后来又主动派遣船只去接运那些由于遭受武力逼迁而无法谋生的华侨回国。中国和印度尼西亚实施双重国籍条约的委员会迄今已举行了十八次会议，并且取得了一些初步的协议。虽然印度尼西亚有势力集团的反华和排华活动仍未停止，但是在两国人民的共同努力下，由于华侨问题而引起的两国之间的紧张局势已经出现某种缓和的迹象。人们本来可以期望，通过中国和印度尼西亚双方的继续努力，华侨问题将会逐步得到解决，中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系将会得到维护和发展。
    但是，印度尼西亚一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力，显然不愿意看到华侨问题的迅速和全面的解决，更不愿意看到中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的发展，他们接二连三地制造了一系列不幸事件。今年4月间，在印度尼西亚廖内省的石叻班让发生了检察当局派遣武装劫持我国派去接运华侨的“大宝康”轮事件，又在东加里曼丹省三马林达发生了地方军事当局武力软禁前往该地协助办理遣送难侨回国事宜的我国驻马辰领事江燕的事件。从5月下旬开始，西爪哇军事当局对华侨进行了第二次大规模的逼迁，采取了逮捕、传讯、殴打、切断住宅水电供应、标封房屋和财产等种种蛮横手段。而现在更发生了芝马圩的流血惨案。这些事实说明，印度尼西亚一小撮别有用心的分子，一贯蓄意挑起事端，扩大事态，力图阻挠华侨问题的合理解决，毒化中国和印度尼西亚之间的关系，以达到他们对外讨好美帝国主义，对内打击爱国民主力量和一切异己势力的肮脏目的。
    很显然，印度尼西亚这一小撮人的罪恶活动，直接违背了印度尼西亚政府一再作出的诺言和所表示的友好愿望。中国政府和中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆曾经多次向印度尼亚西政府提出交涉，要求保护华侨的正当权利和利益，停止对华侨的逼迁和一切迫害活动。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约曾在1960年3月26日给陈毅外交部长的复信中明确表示，印度尼西亚政府已经实现了中国政府关于停止对华侨实行武力逼迁的要求。苏班德里约外长在信中还说，华侨问题“只有双方以慎重态度来处理”，“才能得到解决”，“并且必须使友好气氛成为解决这个困难问题的指导原则”。当然，中国政府和人民愿意看到印度尼西亚政府的这些友好的表示能够完全变成现实，以利于两国之间的友好关系。但是类似西爪哇的武力逼迁和芝马圩惨杀华侨事件的发生，是不符合于印度尼西亚政府的这些友好表示的。
    印度尼西亚这一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的反动分子妄想使印度尼西亚人民相信，只要讨好美国帝国主义，就会给印度尼西亚带来好处。但是，人民的眼睛是雪亮的。因为事实教育着印度尼西亚人民：美国武器一直不断地在加强着霸占印度尼西亚领土西伊里安的荷兰殖民军队；支持着荷兰殖民者对印度尼西亚的军事挑衅和对西伊里安的长期占领。这种讨好美帝国主义的政策，难道是符合于印度尼西亚的民族利益的吗？
    中国人民完全理解，印度尼西亚的一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的反动分子、那些芝马圩惨杀华侨事件的策划者们，绝不能代表印度尼西亚广大的人民。印度尼西亚人民是同中国人民友好的。广大的华侨世世代代辛勤劳动在印度尼西亚的土地上，同印度尼西亚人民结成了亲密的友谊。当华侨遭到无辜迫害时，印度尼西亚人民以至不少地方官员、下级军官、警察和士兵，对他们表示了深切的同情，并给予热情的帮助。许多印度尼西亚友人对归国华侨依依送别，表达了他们对中国人民的深厚友情。在这次芝马圩事件发生后，前往吊唁死难华侨的不仅有华侨，而且还有许多印度尼西亚友人。可见，印度尼西亚广泛阶层的人民是反对反华和排华的，这一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的反动分子在印度尼西亚人民中间是极端孤立的。中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊，是任何反动势力所不能动摇的。尽管在印度尼西亚发生了反华排华事件，甚至出现了芝马圩惨杀华侨的血案，中国人民始终珍视和维护两国人民在长期反对帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的深厚友谊。中国人民对于印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民者霸占西伊里安的正义斗争，过去、现在，以至将来，都给予坚决的支持。
    中国政府在华侨问题上，过去是，现在仍然是从维护中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的愿望出发，主张按照和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的精神，通过友好协商，谋求全面合理的解决。但是，也正是为了维护两国的友好关系，中国政府在就芝马圩事件致印度尼西亚政府的照会中坚决要求印度尼西亚政府就这一事件表示公开道歉，严惩芝马圩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤死难华侨的家属，负担受伤华侨的医药费用和赔偿他们的损失，迅速释放被捕华侨，立即采取有效措施保证今后不再发生类似事件。中国政府并且要求印度尼西亚政府立即制止对华侨的逼迁和各种迫害活动。中国政府的所有这些要求都是合情合理的。我们期待着印度尼西亚政府同样能从维护两国友好关系的愿望出发，作出明智的答复。我们希望印度尼西亚政府能够积极地排除障碍，同中国政府进行共同努力，求得存在于我们两国之间的华侨问题的全面、合理的解决，以有利于维护和发展中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系，有利于亚洲和世界和平。
