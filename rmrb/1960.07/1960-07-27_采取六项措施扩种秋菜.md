　　Take Six Measures to Expand Autumn Vegetable Planting
　　Our Qiaozi Commune did not have the habit of planting vegetables in large areas in the past, and commune members had to go to the county seat to buy vegetables. This year, in order to ensure the timely completion of the autumn vegetable planting plan of 10,100 mu, the commune party committee appointed a secretary to be responsible for leading this work, established a vegetable office, and also adopted six expansion measures: First, vigorously reclaim wasteland and use fallow land to implement intercropping and interplanting to expand the vegetable planting area. Second, diversify varieties, with plains areas growing more Chinese cabbage, turnips, carrots, etc., and mountainous areas growing more radishes and mustard greens. Third, rely on the masses and rely on our own efforts to solve the source of seeds, and strive to produce more vegetables with fewer seeds. Fourth, tap fertilizer sources and apply 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to ensure a bumper harvest of vegetables. Fifth, establish technical training stations in production brigades to improve the technical level of commune members in cultivating vegetables. Sixth, implement a combination of professional teams and vigorous mass movements, and a combination of fixed labor and carrying out shock work to solve the labor problem.
　　After the implementation of the six measures, a high tide of large-scale vegetable planting was immediately set off throughout the commune. The two major brigades of Shayu and Jiuduhe sent more than 400 commune members every day, and reclaimed and planted 500 mu of radishes in two days.

    采取六项措施扩种秋菜
    我们桥梓公社过去没有成片种菜田的习惯，社员吃菜都要到县城去买。今年为了确保按时完成一万零一百亩秋菜种植计划，公社党委确定一名书记负责领导这一工作，成立了蔬菜办公室，还采取了六项扩种措施：第一，大量开荒，利用闲散地实行间作套种的办法扩大蔬菜种植面积。第二，品种多样化，平原地区多种大白菜、蔓菁、胡萝卜等，山区多种大萝卜、芥菜。第三，依靠群众，自力更生解决种源，力争用种少产菜多。第四，挖掘肥源，每亩施肥五千斤，保证蔬菜丰收。第五，在生产大队建立技术传授站，提高社员培育蔬菜的技术水平。第六，实行专业队与大搞群众运动相结合、固定劳力与开展突击相结合的方法，解决劳力问题。
    六项措施推行后，全社立即掀起了大种蔬菜的高潮。沙峪、九渡河两大队每天出动四百多名社员，两天时间就开荒种萝卜五百亩。
