    The World's Oldest Extant Block-Printed Item
    Wang Hongyuan

    Printing is a great creation of the ancient working people of our country; among them, block-printed items appeared around the mid-Tang Dynasty or even earlier. The oldest existing object is the world-famous Diamond Sutra. This scroll is one zhang and six chi long and one chi high, consisting of a frontispiece painting and six pages of equal-sized sutra text glued together. At the end of the scroll, there is a line of text that reads "Respectfully made and widely distributed by Wang Jie for his two parents on the 15th day of the fourth month of the ninth year of Xiantong," from which it can be known that it was carved in the late Tang Dynasty, equivalent to 868 AD.

    This scroll was discovered in 1900 in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, Gansu. Dunhuang has a desert climate, so the books sealed in the stone chambers of the Mogao Caves are almost as good as new.

    The text of this Diamond Sutra has dignified and solemn characters, bright and uniform ink, and a simple and unadorned charm. What is particularly surprising is the frontispiece painting entitled "Jetavana Vihara," which is also the world's oldest extant woodcut. It depicts the scene of Sakyamuni Buddha preaching to the elder Subhuti in Jetavana: Sakyamuni Buddha sits on the lotus seat in the center, gesturing with his right hand as he explains, while Subhuti exposes his right shoulder, kneels on one knee, puts his palms together towards the Buddha, and is listening attentively. Buddhas surround him on all sides, all in a state of quiet listening. Apsaras hover around the top of the Buddha's head, as if looking down from the air; lions lie prostrate on both sides of the Buddha's seat, looking up from the ground. All the Buddhas focus their attention on Sakyamuni, which achieves a concentrated effect on such a complex scene. This frontispiece is not only carefully laid out but also uses the iron-wire drawing technique, which is soft yet firm, conveying strength in tranquility, conveying the different expressions on the faces of the figures, and the clothing lines and ribbons of the Buddhas also have a natural and smooth realistic style. Although the painting depicts gods, due to the painter's realistic creative method, it gives us a real sense of human life.

    The block printing of this Diamond Sutra is so exquisite, and the artistic techniques have reached a state of perfection, from which it can be inferred that the invention of block printing in our country must have been much earlier than the carving date of this Diamond Sutra.

    What is extremely infuriating is that as early as 1907, this scroll was seized by the British Stein using despicable and shameless imperialist tactics and has been hidden in the British Museum for half a century.

    世界现存最古的雕版印刷品
    王红元
    印刷术是我国古代劳动人民的伟大创造；其中雕版印刷品大约在唐朝中叶甚至更早一点就出现了，现存最古的实物，就是全世界著名的金刚般若波罗密经。这卷经长一丈六尺，高一尺，由一页扉画和六页篇幅相等的经文粘连而成。卷末有“咸通九年四月十五日王玠为二亲敬造普施”一行字，由此可知它是刊刻于唐朝末期，相当公元868年。
    这卷经在1900年发现于甘肃敦煌千佛洞。敦煌具有沙漠地区的气候，所以密封于千佛洞石室的书籍几乎都完整如新。
    这卷金刚经的经文，字体端庄凝重、墨色鲜明匀称，有一种浑朴率真的气韵。特别使人惊异的是那幅题为“只树给孤独园”的扉画，这同时也是一幅世界现存最古的版画。上面绘着释迦牟尼佛在给孤独园对长老须菩提说法的情形：释迦牟尼坐在正中的莲花座上、右手挥动作讲解的手势，须菩提右肩裸露、一膝著地、合掌向佛、正在虔诚聆教。诸佛围绕四周，皆作静听之状。飞天盘旋于佛顶左右、似在空中俯视；狮子俯卧在佛座两旁、从地上仰观。诸佛都将目光集中在释迦牟尼身上，使这样景物纷繁的画面，收到了集中的效果。这幅扉画不仅布局谨严，并且运用了柔中带刚的铁线描法，寓挺劲于平和，传出了人物面部表情各不相同的神态，诸佛的衣纹飘带也具有自然流畅的写实作风。画中虽然描绘的都是神，由于画家现实主义的创作方法，倒给了我们一种人间真实的生活感。
    这卷金刚经雕版印刷如此精美，艺术技巧已达到了纯熟的境界，由此可以推知，我国雕版印刷术的发明一定比这卷金刚经的刊刻年代要早得多。
    令人非常愤恨的是，早在1907年这卷经就被英国人斯坦因用卑鄙无耻的帝国主义手腕巧取豪夺而去，窝藏于伦敦博物院已达半世纪之久了。
