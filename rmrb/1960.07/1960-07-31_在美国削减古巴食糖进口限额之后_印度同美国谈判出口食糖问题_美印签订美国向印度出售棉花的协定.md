Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th. New Delhi dispatch: According to Indian newspapers, after the United States recently cut sugar imports from Cuba, the Indian government is negotiating with the US government on exporting sugar to the United States.

    The "Indian Express" said on the 28th that Indian Prime Minister Nehru met with Food Minister Patil on the 27th, and Patil reported to Nehru on the progress of his negotiations with the United States on sugar exports.

    The newspaper said, "India can export 250,000 tons of sugar to the United States in the next two years, but the exact amount that can be exported this year remains to be negotiated."

    The Indian News Agency said in a commentary on the 27th, "Negotiations for India to sell sugar to the United States by taking advantage of Washington's ban on Cuban sugar have already begun. Undoubtedly, this will allow us to obtain the US dollars we desperately need. However, the extent to which Cuba—which valiantly resists Uncle Sam's intimidation—together with the rest of Latin America, will understand Patil's political economics is something the Prime Minister must... seriously consider. The price of our foreign policy is certainly not worth just the thousands of dollars earned by the sugar barons."

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. According to a report from the Indian Information Service on the 29th: The governments of India and the United States signed an agreement in New Delhi on the 29th for the United States to sell another 400,000 bales of cotton to India.

    The agreement was signed by Gupta, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Finance, and Taylor Wood, Minister of the US Embassy in India responsible for economic affairs and head of the Technical Cooperation Mission.

    This batch of cotton is worth 41.6 million US dollars (equivalent to 198 million rupees). The Indian Information Service said that the Indian government will repay this amount in rupees. The agreement stipulates that the US government will provide 85% of this income to the Indian government for "economic development purposes."

    The Indian Information Service said that the two governments also reached an agreement on the additional sale of 200,000 bales of cotton to India by American merchants.

    The news said that since 1956, the United States has sold a total of 800,000 bales of raw cotton to India, worth 87 million US dollars.

    The Indian Information Service also said that to date, the total amount of "economic assistance" given to India by the United States has exceeded 3.5 billion US dollars (16.66 billion rupees).

    According to a Washington dispatch, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, controlled by the United States, announced on the 29th that it would loan 70 million US dollars to India. The loan agreement has been signed in Washington by Chagla, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, and Elif, Vice President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

    The news said that to date, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has provided India with 24 loans, totaling 662 million US dollars.

    印度新闻社在27日的评论中说，“印度乘华盛顿禁止古巴糖的机会向美国出售食糖的谈判已经开始。毫无疑问，这将使我们得到我们所非常需要的美元。可是，英勇地抵抗山姆大叔的威吓的古巴——同古巴在一起的还有整个拉丁美洲——将在多大程度上理解帕蒂尔的政治经济学是总理必须……认真考虑的事情。我们外交政策的价格肯定地不只值糖大王所赚的几千美元。”
