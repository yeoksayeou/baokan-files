Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Amidst the anti-China and anti-Chinese tide stirred up by influential groups in Indonesia, a small group of Indonesian newspapers has been constantly stirring up trouble, inciting anti-China and anti-Chinese hysteria, playing an extremely malicious role. Echoing the international anti-China conspiracy orchestrated by U.S. imperialism, they have been deliberately undermining the relations between China and Indonesia, obstructing the smooth resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue, openly insulting the Chinese government and state leaders, attacking Chinese diplomatic missions, clamoring for tearing up the Bandung Resolutions, and resorting to the most shameless rumors and abuse.

These newspapers' anti-China and anti-Chinese clamor has long been subject to any restrictions from the relevant authorities. Since the Indonesian Minister of Commerce issued the anti-Chinese decree banning foreign small vendors in May 1959, they have all started shouting and have not stopped to this day. According to incomplete statistics, six newspapers in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, namely "Indonesia Raya," "Kompas," "Merdeka," "Pedoman," "Indonesia Torch," and "The Independent," published more than 450 anti-China and anti-Chinese news items, commentaries, editorials, etc., of various forms and contents, totaling more than 470,000 words, from October last year to May this year. Some of these newspapers also published many cartoons and pictures insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chinese state leaders.

	Rampantly Fabricating Rumors, Attempting to Undermine Our Country's Prestige

The most rampant is the "Indonesia Raya" newspaper, which has close ties with the United States Information Service and is directly backed by influential groups. This newspaper has almost become a special publication for anti-China and anti-Chinese articles for a year. Its front page is often filled with anti-China and anti-Chinese news, short comments, editorials, cartoons, maps, and various anti-China materials supplied by the United States Information Service. According to incomplete statistics, in the fifty-odd days of November and December last year, this newspaper, which was helped by the United States Information Service to distribute, published about 90,000 words of anti-China and anti-Chinese articles, and about 25,000 words in May this year.

The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper, which boasts of being well-informed about Indonesian foreign affairs, specializes in fabricating various unfounded rumors to incite anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiments. This newspaper falsely claimed on January 22 that "the Chinese side is delaying the ratification of the exchange of instruments of ratification for the dual nationality treaty." On February 10, it falsely claimed that "Chinese embassies and consulates have become warehouses for returning Overseas Chinese, using diplomatic items to send back items that Overseas Chinese cannot take back to their country." According to incomplete statistics, this newspaper, which has close ties with a certain authority in Indonesian diplomatic circles, has published more than 30 such major "own report" fabricated "news" items on the front page headline and in prominent positions in more than half a year.

These newspapers actively respond to the anti-China conspiracy orchestrated by U.S. imperialism worldwide, manufacturing a large number of sensational rumors, and spreading slanderous remarks in successive reports, attempting to undermine the growing prestige and influence of New China worldwide. They follow the example of the propaganda machines of imperialist countries, and falsely claim that China "provokes small-scale wars in some regions," "threatens friendly neighbors in Southeast Asia," and "attempts to control the entire Asia," etc. They even falsely claim that China "invaded" its own territory of Taiwan and Tibet ("Indonesia Raya"), "Beijing is changing its face and likes to interfere in other countries' internal affairs," and China "disrupted the (Indonesian) national tranquility," etc.

During April and May this year, when Dutch colonialists were carrying out provocations against Indonesia in West Irian, influential groups in Indonesia deliberately launched a new anti-China and anti-Chinese wave. On the same day, they used force to place Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Banjarmasin, under house arrest, and forcibly hijacked the "Da Baokang" ship sent by the Chinese government to transport Overseas Chinese. At this time, these newspapers clamored for anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, trying to cooperate with the reactionary traitorous forces in Indonesia to divert and disperse the Indonesian people's anger against the Dutch colonialists' reinforcement of troops in West Irian. They even shamelessly said that "the actions of the Netherlands and China in Indonesia are basically the same" ("Pedoman"), "Indonesia is facing two threats, one from The Hague and one from Beijing," "(Indonesia) The government's firm attitude is to deal with the rebel groups, the Netherlands in West Irian, and China" ("Indonesia Torch"). They completely disregarded the Chinese government's consistent position of firmly supporting the Indonesian people's opposition to imperialist interference and the large amount of factual assistance given morally and materially, and maliciously slandered that "when Indonesia is facing military operations in West Irian, Beijing seems to see a good opportunity to undermine the Indonesian government through actions like last year" ("The Independent").

	Ignoring the Role of Overseas Chinese, Wantonly Insulting Overseas Chinese, Inciting National Hatred

In order to achieve the purpose of inciting anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, these newspapers completely ignore the positive role played by Overseas Chinese in developing the Indonesian economy and supporting the Indonesian People’s national independence struggle, wantonly insulting Overseas Chinese, and inciting national hatred. On the front pages of these newspapers, they often use large-character headlines to slander the vast number of Overseas Chinese small vendors and legitimate industrial and commercial operators as "remnants of colonial economy." But even the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs had to admit in the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers that the Overseas Chinese economy is a positive factor in Indonesia’s economic development. They disregard the fact that the vast majority of Overseas Chinese have long supported the Indonesian People’s national independence cause in all aspects, including giving their lives, and stubbornly reverse black and white to slander that: "Throughout history, Overseas Chinese have consistently adopted reactionary and counter-revolutionary attitudes, and have consistently sided with the enemies of the Indonesian nation."

These newspapers spare no effort to support the influential groups to act recklessly to the end, and constantly obstruct the settlement of Overseas Chinese issues through consultation. They oppose any suggestions made by the Chinese government regarding the reasonable settlement of Overseas Chinese issues. As soon as the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Indonesian foreign ministers was published, these newspapers immediately launched attacks, laying the groundwork for undermining the joint communiqué. "Indonesia Raya" spread rumors that Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio was "insulted" in Beijing, and Subandrio was "signing the joint communiqué under pressure from the Chinese side." It also falsely claimed that the Chinese side's request to resolve the Overseas Chinese issue through consultation was "interference in Indonesia's internal affairs" ("Indonesia Torch"). It did everything possible to attack and undermine the three letters from Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi to Subandrio, clamoring "do not be misled by the various suggestions put forward in Chen Yi's letter," "The Chinese government and Chen Yi have adopted a rude attitude towards Indonesia." "Indonesia Raya" further reversed black and white and said that "the essence of Chen Yi's letter to Subandrio is anti-Indonesian," and it even arrogantly demanded that "if China wants to negotiate, it should withdraw Huang Zhen and his subordinates." "The Independent" incited and said, "Chen Yi's unreasonable proposal should be rejected!"

	Attempting to Obstruct Overseas Chinese from Returning to Their Motherland

When the Chinese government sent ships to transport back those Overseas Chinese who had lost their livelihood and were displaced due to anti-Chinese activities, these newspapers attempted to obstruct Overseas Chinese from returning to their motherland. They began by asserting that "the Overseas Chinese who want to return home must be a minority," "they will certainly not be able to enjoy the happiness they enjoy in Indonesia in China" ("The Independent"). When a large number of Overseas Chinese broke through the many difficulties set up by the influential groups in Indonesia and returned to their motherland to live and work in peace, they further spread rumors that "Overseas Chinese have to accept inspections and brainwashing after returning home, otherwise they cannot move freely," "The Chinese government has planned to establish a shelter in Shenzhen to screen Overseas Chinese under the supervision of the Public Security Bureau" ("Indonesia Raya").

These newspapers also frantically defame, insult and attack the Chinese government, Chinese state leaders, and Chinese embassies and consulates in Indonesia. "Indonesia Raya" openly and maliciously abused Chairman Mao, the beloved and great leader of the Chinese people, by the most despicable means. In a cartoon about Chairman Mao, it deliberately wrote Chairman Mao's name as "茅贼" (Mao Thief) in Chinese. This newspaper also insulted and said that "Mao (Zedong)—Zhou (Enlai)—Chen (Yi) is more dangerous than General Tojo." It even shamelessly fabricated rumors that "Chen Yi told Subandrio that China will crush Indonesia's economic status through Singapore, and China will help the 'Overall Struggle Charter Group'—the 'Indonesian Revolutionary Government' rebel group." "Kompas" also defamed Premier Zhou Enlai for "tearing up Pancasila."

As for the attacks and slanders against Huang Zhen, the ambassador to Indonesia as the representative of the Chinese head of state, and against the Chinese Embassy and consulates, these newspapers have never stopped for the past six months. These newspapers have consistently called the Chinese Embassy’s representations to the Indonesian government for the purpose of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and for the serious incidents of continuous persecution of Overseas Chinese as "interference in Indonesia's internal affairs" and "inciting Overseas Chinese," and constantly clamored arrogantly to "expel" Ambassador Huang Zhen and other diplomatic personnel. Such headline titles and rumors often appear in these anti-Chinese newspapers: "The Chinese Embassy is carrying out provocative activities," "Indonesia and China's relations can only be restored by declaring Huang Zhen persona non grata" ("Indonesia Raya") "Chinese officials leave West Java!" ("Indonesia Torch") "Indonesia Raya" also frantically clamored to "close down" the Jakarta branch of the Xinhua News Agency and the Chinese bank in Jakarta.

	Frantically Opposing China While Kowtowing to U.S. Imperialism

These newspapers' anti-China and anti-Chinese clamor has inextricable links with the anti-China and anti-communist conspiracy orchestrated by imperialism. Another purpose of these newspapers' instigation of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities is to take the opportunity to attack and frame the progressive forces in Indonesia and the Indonesian Communist Party. They slander the Indonesian Communist Party as "working as China's fifth column" ("Indonesia Raya"), and even encourage the army to take action against the Indonesian Communist Party.

For the same reason, these newspapers frantically oppose China and discriminate against Chinese on the one hand, but on the other hand, they kowtow to imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States, whitewash them, try their best to cover up the U.S. imperialists' crimes of aggression against Indonesia and worldwide, attempt to paralyze the Indonesian people, and portray China and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as the main enemies of the Indonesian people. They said, "Western colonialism is dead" ("Indonesia Raya") "Hitler's National Socialist Party is no different from the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties" ("Merdeka") "If compared with the two major imperialisms of the Soviet Union and China, then historical imperialism and capitalism are nothing in terms of their latent dangers and standards." ("Indonesia Raya") "Indonesia Torch" attacked Ambassador Huang Zhen and the Chinese Embassy, ​​but made no secret of its flattery of the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones. In the same editorial, it nauseatingly flattered: "(U.S. Ambassador) Jones is one of the most successful diplomats in the United States, and he always smiles at Indonesian officials and people."

"Indonesia Torch" believes that anti-Chinese discrimination is more important than the trial of Pope, the American executioner who slaughtered the Indonesian people. It even attacked some Indonesian newspapers with a sense of justice for demanding a trial of Pope in order to "divert the target."

	Attempting to Make Indonesia Completely Lean Towards Imperialism

These newspapers also attempt to tear up the Bandung Resolutions firmly supported by the Indonesian people through anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, so that Indonesia abandons its national independence and peaceful and neutral policy and completely leans towards imperialism. They clamored: Indonesia "can no longer remain neutral" ("Indonesia Raya") "The slogan of peaceful coexistence and the concept of friendship are only used to hypnotize other countries, so that communists can carry out infiltration" ("Indonesia Raya") "We should not be fooled by the Bandung Conference," "It is necessary to make a more appropriate assessment of it—the Bandung Conference—based on time and circumstances."

	The Indonesian People Are Increasingly Seeing Through the Reactionary Faces of These Newspapers

The above facts show that the path taken by this small group of newspapers in the past year is increasingly contrary to the wishes of the vast number of Indonesian people and patriotic progressive forces to oppose imperialist aggression, safeguard national independence, safeguard world peace and Indonesia’s neutral position, and develop friendly and cooperative relations with socialist countries. On many major issues, especially the Overseas Chinese issue, they have become the echoers of U.S. imperialism, thereby seriously damaging the interests of the Indonesian people and the friendly relations between Indonesia and China. Their reactionary faces are being increasingly seen through by the vast Indonesian people.

### 同美帝国主义的阴谋亦步亦趋　同印度尼西亚人民的愿望背道而驰  印度尼西亚一小撮报纸兴风作浪猖狂反华  处心积虑破坏中国印度尼西亚友好关系并公然辱骂我国领导人

    同美帝国主义的阴谋亦步亦趋　同印度尼西亚人民的愿望背道而驰
    印度尼西亚一小撮报纸兴风作浪猖狂反华
    处心积虑破坏中国印度尼西亚友好关系并公然辱骂我国领导人
    新华社8日讯　在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的反华、排华逆流中，印度尼西亚的一小撮报纸不断兴风作浪，煽动反华排华歇斯底里，起了十分恶毒的作用。它们同美帝国主义策动的国际反华阴谋相呼应，处心积虑地破坏中国和印度尼西亚的关系，阻挠华侨问题的顺利解决，公然辱骂中国政府和国家领导人，攻击中国外交代表机构，叫嚣撕毁万隆决议，极尽无耻造谣谩骂之能事。
    这些报纸的反华排华叫嚣长期没有受到有关当局的任何限制，自从1959年5月印度尼西亚政府商业部长颁布了禁止外侨小商贩的排华条例之后，它们就一齐开始大叫大嚷，至今没有停止。据不完全统计，印度尼西亚首都雅加达的“印度尼西亚群岛报”、“指南针报”、“永恒日报”、“社会使者报”、“印度尼西亚火炬报”和“独立报”六家报纸，从去年10月到今年5月，共发表各种形式和内容的反华排华消息、评论、社论等四百五十条以上，约四十七万多字。其中有些报纸还发表了许多侮辱中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和中国国家领导人的漫画和图片等。
    大肆制造谣言　妄图破坏我国威信
    最为猖狂的是同美国新闻处有密切关系并且受到有势力集团直接在背后撑腰的“印度尼西亚群岛报”。这家报纸一年以来，几乎成了反华排华的专刊，在它的第一版经常塞满了反华、排华的消息、短评、社论、漫画、地图，还有美国新闻处供给的各种反华材料。据不完全统计，在去年11、12两个月的五十多天内，这家由美国新闻处帮忙发行的报纸就大约共发表了反华排华文字九万多字，今年5月共约发表二万五千多字。
    以印度尼西亚外交消息灵通自吹的“印度尼西亚火炬报”专门制造各种毫无根据的谣言来煽动反华排华情绪。这家报纸在1月22日造谣说“中国方面拖延批准互换双重国籍协定批准书”。它在2月10日又造谣说“中国大使馆和总领事馆已成为归国华侨的货仓，把华侨不能带回国去的物品当作外交物品寄回去。”据不完全统计，这家跟印度尼西亚外交界某权威人士有密切关系的报纸在半年多时间内就在第一版头条和在显著地位发表这样重大的“本报”造谣“消息”达三十多条。
    这些报纸积极响应美帝国主义在世界范围内策动的反华阴谋，制造大量耸人听闻的谣言，连篇累牍地散播诬蔑性的言论，妄图来破坏新中国在世界范围内的日益增长的威望和影响。它们追随帝国主义国家宣传机器的榜样，胡说什么中国“在若干地区挑起小规模战争”，“威胁东南亚友好邻邦”，“企图控制整个亚洲”等。甚至胡说中国“侵略”了自己的领土台湾和西藏（“印度尼西亚群岛报”），“北京正在改变面孔，喜欢干涉别国内政”，中国“扰乱了（印度尼西亚）民族的安宁”等。
    今年4、5月间，也就是荷兰殖民主义者在西伊里安进行对印度尼西亚挑衅的时候，印度尼西亚有势力集团却别有用心地掀起了一个新的反华排华浪潮，他们在同一天里用武力软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕，又用武力劫持中国政府派去接运华侨的“大宝康号”轮船。就在这时候，这些报纸大肆叫嚣反华排华，力图配合印度尼西亚国内反动卖国势力，转移和分散印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民主义者增兵西伊里安的愤怒情绪。它们甚至厚颜无耻地说“荷兰的行动和中国在印度尼西亚的行动基本是一样的”，（“社会使者报”）“印度尼西亚面对着两头威胁，一头来自海牙，一头来自北京”，“（印度尼西亚）政府的坚决态度是对付叛乱集团、在西伊里安的荷兰和中国”（“印度尼西亚火炬报”）。它们完全不顾中国政府坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义干涉的一贯立场和在道义上和物质上尽力给予援助的大量事实，恶意诬蔑地说“在印度尼西亚面对西伊里安的军事行动时，北京看来看到了一个良好的机会通过像去年一样的行动来破坏印度尼西亚政府”（“独立报”）。
    抹煞华侨作用　肆意侮辱华侨　煽动民族仇恨
    这些报纸为了达到煽动反华排华的目的，完全抹煞华侨在对发展印度尼西亚经济和在支持印度尼西亚人民民族独立斗争中所起的积极作用，肆意侮辱华侨，煽动民族仇恨。这些报纸的第一版上经常用大字标题把广大的华侨小商贩和正当的工商业者诬蔑为“殖民经济的残余”。可是就是印度尼西亚外交部长也不能不在两国外交部长联合公报里承认华侨经济对印度尼西亚经济发展是一个积极因素。它们不顾绝大多数华侨长期以来从各个方面，包括献出了生命在内，全力支持印度尼西亚人民的民族独立事业的事实，硬颠倒黑白地诬蔑说：“有史以来，华侨一贯采取反动的、反革命的态度，一贯倒向印度尼西亚民族的敌人方面”。
    这些报纸竭力支持有势力集团蛮干到底，不断阻挠通过协商来解决华侨问题，对于中国政府提出的有关合理解决华侨问题的任何建议，都一律反对。中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报刚刚发表，这些报纸就立即展开攻击，为破坏联合公报埋下伏笔。“印度尼西亚群岛报”散布谣言说，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在北京受到了“侮辱”，苏班德里约是“在中国方面的压力下在联合公报上签字的”。它还胡说什么中国方面要求协商解决华侨问题是“对印度尼西亚内政的干涉”。（“印度尼西亚火炬报”）对中国外交部长陈毅给苏班德里约的三次信件极尽攻击破坏之能事，叫嚣“千万不要被陈毅信件中所提出的各种建议所迷惑”，“中国政府和陈毅对印度尼西亚采取了粗暴的态度”。“印度尼西亚群岛报”进一步颠倒黑白地说“陈毅给苏班德里约的信件的实质是反印度尼西亚”，它甚至狂妄地要求说，“中国如果要谈判，就应撤回黄镇和他的部下”。“独立报”煽动说，“陈毅的毫无理由的提议应该打回去！”
    企图阻挠华侨返回自己的祖国
    当中国政府派出船只准备把那些由于排华活动而生路断绝、流离失所的华侨接运回去的时候，这些报纸又企图阻挠华侨返回自己的祖国。它们开始时断言“要回国的华侨一定是少数”，“他们在中国肯定不能享受在印度尼西亚享受到的快乐”（“独立报”）。在大批华侨突破印度尼西亚有势力集团布下的重重困难回到祖国安居乐业的时候，它们又进一步造谣说，“华侨归国后都要接受检查和洗脑，否则他们不能自由活动”，“中国政府已经计划在深圳建立一个收容站，在公安局监督下对华侨进行甄别。”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）。
    这些报纸还猖狂地诽谤、侮辱和攻击中国政府、中国国家领导人和中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和领事馆等。“印度尼西亚群岛报”公然以最卑鄙的手段恶毒谩骂中国人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，它在一幅关于毛主席的漫画中，竟然有意地把毛主席的名字写成中文“茅贼”。这家报纸还辱骂说“毛（泽东）—周（恩来）—陈（毅）比东条将军更危险”。它甚至无耻地造谣说，“陈毅对苏班德里约说，中国将通过新加坡粉碎印度尼西亚的经济地位，中国将帮助‘全面斗争约章集团’——‘印度尼西亚革命政府’叛乱集团”。“指南针报”还诽谤周恩来总理“撕毁潘查希拉”。
    至于对作为中国国家元首代表的驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇、对中国大使馆和领事馆的攻击和诽谤，这些报纸大半年来一直没有停止过。这些报纸把中国大使馆为保护华侨的正当权益，为华侨不断遭受迫害的严重事件向印度尼西亚政府提出的交涉一律叫做“干涉印度尼西亚的内政”和“在华侨中进行煽动”，不断蛮横地叫嚣“驱逐”黄镇大使和其他外交人员。这些排华报纸上经常出现这样的头条标题和造谣消息：“中国大使馆进行挑衅性的活动”，“只有宣布黄镇为不受欢迎的人，印度尼西亚和中国的关系才能恢复过来”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）“中国官员们离开西爪哇吧！”（“印度尼西亚火炬报”）“印度尼西亚群岛报”还猖狂地叫嚷“封闭”新华通讯社雅加达分社和中国在雅加达的银行。
    一面疯狂反华一面对美帝国主义卑躬屈膝
    这些报纸的反华排华叫嚣同帝国主义策动的反华反共阴谋有着千丝万缕的关系。这些报纸煽动反华排华活动的另一个目的就是借机打击和陷害印度尼西亚国内的进步力量和印度尼西亚共产党。它们诽谤印度尼西亚共产党“作为中国的第五纵队而工作”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”），甚至鼓动军队起来对印度尼西亚共产党采取行动。
    由于同样的原因，这些报纸一面疯狂地反华排华，一面却对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义卑躬屈膝、涂脂抹粉，尽力掩饰美帝国主义对印度尼西亚和在世界范围内的侵略罪行，妄图麻痹印度尼西亚人民，并且把中国和苏联等社会主义国家说成是印度尼西亚人民的主要敌人。它们说，“西方殖民主义已经死亡”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）“希特勒的国社党同苏联和中国的共产党没有分别”（“永恒日报”）“如果同苏联和中国两大帝国主义比较，那末历史帝国主义和资本主义就其潜伏着的危险和标准来说，就算不得什么了”。（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）“印度尼西亚火炬报”在攻击黄镇大使和中国大使馆的同时，却毫不掩饰对美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯的奉承。它在同一篇社论中肉麻地阿谀道：“（美国大使）琼斯是美国最成功的外交官之一，他总是对印度尼西亚官员和人民微笑。”
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”认为排华比审判屠杀印度尼西亚人民的美国刽子手波普重要得多，它甚至攻击一些有正义感的印度尼西亚报纸提出要求审判波普是为了“转移目标”。
    妄图使印度尼西亚彻底倒向帝国主义
    这些报纸还妄图通过反华、排华活动撕毁印度尼西亚人民所坚决拥护的万隆决议，使印度尼西亚放弃民族独立与和平中立政策，彻底倒向帝国主义。它们叫嚷：印度尼西亚“不可能再守中立了”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）“和平共处的口号，友好的概念，只是用来催眠别的国家，从而使共产主义分子进行渗透”（“印度尼西亚群岛报”）“我们不要上万隆会议的当”，“应当根据时间和情况对它——万隆会议作出更适当的估价”。
    印度尼西亚人民日益识破这些报纸的反动面目
    上述事实说明，这一小撮报纸一年来所走的道路，同印度尼西亚广大人民和爱国进步势力反对帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立、维护世界和平与印度尼西亚的中立地位，以及同社会主义国家发展友好合作关系的愿望，是愈来愈背道而驰了。它们在许多重大问题特别是华侨问题上，成了美帝国主义的应声虫，从而严重损害了印度尼西亚人民的利益和印度尼西亚同中国的友好关系。它们的反动面目正日益为广大印度尼西亚人民所识破。
