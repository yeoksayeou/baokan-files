Commerce Should Vigorously Support the Technical Transformation of Agriculture

Actively supporting agriculture and promoting its technical transformation is a glorious and urgent task for all sectors of the economy. As the "logistics department" of agricultural production, socialist commerce should even more fully utilize its functions to provide strong support for the technical transformation of agriculture in every possible way.

The content of agricultural technical transformation is very rich and its scope is very broad. Where should commercial departments start in supporting the technical transformation of agriculture? Doing a good job in supplying materials allocated by the state plan is an extremely important aspect of supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. Supplying agricultural production materials is not an unfamiliar task for commercial departments. Commercial departments supply agricultural production materials every year and every season. However, under the new situation, the supply of production materials is also changing. Due to the rapid development of China's industrial production, the capacity of industry to support agricultural technical transformation has been strengthened. According to the state plan, the various production materials and materials necessary for technical transformation that industrial departments will provide to agriculture this year will greatly increase compared to the past. Many large-scale agricultural production materials are used in sets, and none can be missing, unlike manual farm tools. For example, none of the four major components of irrigation and drainage equipment can be missing; supplying tractors also requires supplying fuel and a considerable number of spare parts and accessories, as well as corresponding tractor-drawn farm implements; some agricultural machinery has complex specifications and a high degree of precision, and individual parts that are missing or of slightly inferior specifications or quality will affect the performance of the entire machine. It can be seen that the work of supplying production materials is more complex and arduous than in the past from all aspects. Therefore, to do a good job in supplying production materials, we cannot be satisfied with old experiences in business methods, nor can we think that the task is completed as long as production materials are supplied. Commercial department employees must work hard to learn professional knowledge, be familiar with the commodity performance and specifications of various modern machines, and learn the installation, use, and repair of machinery. Commercial departments must set up supply outlets reasonably and send the most urgently needed materials for agricultural production to the front line of production; commercial departments must also help communes train a large number of technical personnel so that they can learn the repair and use of machinery; thereby closely integrating supply, repair, and use, and enabling the various agricultural machines supplied to fully exert their effectiveness in production. All of this requires commercial department employees to improve their business methods and improve the efficiency and quality of their work in order to do a better job in supplying production materials.

Commercial support for the technical transformation of agriculture is not limited to doing a good job in supplying production materials. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, China will basically realize agricultural mechanization in about ten years, but in the next two or three years, it will still focus on improving farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, and especially on grasping the reform of farm tools. Improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools are an important preparation for agricultural mechanization, and they are of great significance for accelerating the process of mechanization. Therefore, commercial departments must actively participate in the reform of farm tools and various tools, provide technology, samples, and drawings to the people's communes; they must adapt to local conditions and seasons, and cooperate with relevant departments to first help the people's communes grasp those projects that can save labor to the greatest extent, are the simplest to manufacture, and are the easiest to promote, and quickly summarize, appraise, finalize, and promote them, so as to save more labor for agriculture, and gradually lead the reform of farm tools and tools to the path of semi-mechanization and mechanization.

Another important way for commerce to support the technical transformation of agriculture is to vigorously support the development of commune-run industries aimed at serving agricultural production. China has a vast territory, and the number of equipment required for agricultural technical transformation is huge, and it is impossible to supply it all by large-scale industry. Now, due to the increasing soundness and consolidation of rural people's communes, commune-run industries are developing rapidly, and a very important force has been added to implement agricultural technical transformation. This objective situation determines that commercial departments must implement the "two-legged approach" of state-planned supply and people's communes relying on their own efforts in supporting agricultural technical transformation: on the one hand, large-scale industry should strive to increase the production of modern large-scale agricultural machinery to equip agriculture with the latest technology; on the other hand, commercial departments must also try their best to support the development of commune-run industries, and gradually equip agriculture by supporting commune-run industries.

Equipping agriculture through commune-run industries facilitates mobilizing the manpower and material resources of the vast rural areas, facilitates adapting to local conditions, taking materials locally according to needs, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally, thus conducive to accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. We must not underestimate the important role of commune-run industries in supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. Taking the production of electrical equipment as an example, this is an unfamiliar matter for commune-run industries, and there are certainly difficulties in producing such products, but now, with the help of commercial departments, many local commune-run industries, relying on their own efforts and taking materials locally, have been able to manufacture relatively complex equipment and materials such as indigenous generators, indigenous water turbines, and indigenous transformers. The idea of ​​looking down on commune-run industries, looking down on indigenous methods, and "single-mindedly looking to foreign countries and reaching out with both hands" in the supply of production materials is not conducive to accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. Commercial departments must enthusiastically regard supporting the development of commune-run industries as their own responsibility, first of all, plan and step by step to help communes establish farm tool repair and manufacturing plants that are urgently needed for current agricultural production, and try their best to help these commune-run industries solve problems such as raw materials, equipment, tools, fuel, and funds, and actively purchase commune-run industrial products. At the same time, they must also help communes actively develop agricultural and sideline product processing, indigenous fertilizers, and indigenous pesticides industries according to conditions, in order to strengthen the force of agricultural technical transformation and accelerate the development of agricultural production. If commercial departments do a good job in supporting commune-run industries aimed at serving agricultural production, they will make a very beneficial contribution to the cause of agricultural technical transformation.

Supporting the technical transformation of agriculture is the common task of all departments of the national economy. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, commercial departments must carry forward the communist style of "division of labor but no boundaries, competing for work but yielding honors," take the initiative to cooperate with all parties, and make the greatest efforts to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and promote the overall leap forward of the national economy.

    商业要大力支援农业技术改造
    积极地支援农业，促进农业的技术改造，这是各行各业的一项光荣而迫切的任务。作为农业生产“后勤部”的社会主义商业，更应当充分运用本身的职能，千方百计地给农业技术改造以大力的支援。
    农业技术改造的内容十分丰富，范围十分广阔。商业部门在支援农业技术改造中，应当从何着手呢？抓好国家计划调拨的物资供应工作，是支援农业技术改造的一个极为重要的方面。供应农业生产资料，这对商业部门来说并不是一项陌生的工作。商业部门年年季季都要供应农业生产资料。但是在新形势下面，生产资料供应也在发生变化。由于我国工业生产的飞跃发展，现在工业支援农业技术改造的能力加强了。按照国家计划，今年工业部门向农业提供的各种生产资料和技术改造所必需的物资，将比过去有很大的增长。而许多大型农业生产资料与手工农具不同，它们多是配套使用，缺一不可的。例如排灌设备的四大件少了哪一样也不行；供应拖拉机还需要供应燃料和相当数量的备品、配件，以及相应的机引农具；有些农业机具规格复杂，精密程度也比较高，个别部件缺损或规格质量稍差，都会影响整个机械效能的发挥；可见生产资料供应工作不论从哪方面来讲都比过去更为复杂而繁重了，因此，要做好生产资料供应工作，在经营方法上就不能满足于老的经验，更不能认为只要把生产资料供应出去就算完成任务了。商业部门职工要努力学习业务知识，熟悉各种现代机具的商品性能、规格，学会机械的安装、使用和修理。商业部门要做到合理地设置供应网点，把农业生产最急需的物资送到生产第一线去；商业部门还要做到帮助公社大量培训技术人员，使他们学会机械的修理和使用；从而把供应、修理、使用密切结合起来，使供应的各种农业机具在生产中充分发挥效能。所有这些，都要求商业部门职工，必须改进经营方法，提高工作的效率和质量，才能把生产资料的供应工作做得更好。
    商业支援农业技术改造，不仅限于做好生产资料供应工作。根据党中央的指示，我国要在十年左右的时间内基本实现农业机械化，但在最近两三年内，还要以改良农具和半机械化农具为主，特别要抓好农具的改革工作。改良农具和半机械化农具是农业机械化的重要准备，它对于加快机械化的进程具有重要意义。因此，商业部门必须积极地参与农具和各种工具的改革，为人民公社提供技术，提供样品、图纸；要因地因时制宜，协同有关部门首先帮助人民公社抓那些能够最大限度地节约劳动力、制造最简便而又最便于推广的项目，尽快地加以总结鉴定、定型推广，以便为农业节约更多的劳动力，并逐步地把农具和工具的改革引向半机械化和机械化的道路上来。
    商业支援农业技术改造的另一个重要途径是大力支援以服务农业生产为目的的社办工业的发展。我国地区辽阔，农业技术改造所需的装备数量巨大，不可能全部由大工业供给。现在由于农村人民公社日益健全巩固，社办工业正在迅速发展起来，实行农业技术改造增加了一支十分重要的力量。这一客观形势决定了商业部门在支援农业技术改造中，必须要贯彻国家有计划地供应和人民公社自力更生的“两条腿走路”的方针：一方面大工业努力增产现代化大型农业机械，以最新的技术装备农业；另一方面商业部门也要千方百计地支援社办工业的发展，通过支援社办工业逐步把农业装备起来。
    通过社办工业装备农业便于调动广大农村的人力物力，便于因地制宜，根据需要就地取材，就地制造，就地供应，因而有利于加快农业技术改造。我们切不可小看社办工业在支援农业技术改造中的重大作用。拿生产电工器材来说，这对社办工业是一件陌生的事情，生产这样的产品当然是有困难的，但是现在许多地方的社办工业在商业部门帮助下，自力更生，就地取材，已经可以制造出土发电机、土水轮机、土变压器等比较复杂的设备和器材了。那种看不起社办工业，看不起土法，在生产资料供应上“一心向洋，两手向上”的思想，是不利于加速农业技术改造的。商业部门必须满腔热情地把支援社办工业的发展作为自己份内的责任，首先要有计划有步骤地帮助公社建立为当前农业生产迫切需要的农具修造厂，要千方百计地帮助这些社办工业解决原料、设备、工具、燃料、资金等问题，并且积极地收购社办工业产品。同时，还要根据条件，帮助公社积极地发展农副产品加工、土化肥、土农药等工业，以壮大农业技术改造的力量，加快农业生产的发展。商业部门支援以服务农业生产为目的的社办工业工作做得好，就是对农业技术改造事业做出了十分有益的贡献。
    支援农业技术改造是国民经济各部门共同的任务，商业部门要在各级党委的统一领导下，发扬“有分工、无界限，争工作、让荣誉”的共产主义风格，主动协作各方，为加快农业技术改造和促进国民经济全面跃进尽最大的努力。
