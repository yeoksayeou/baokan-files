    Tianjin Renovates Railways to Increase Transport Volume
    First Phase Completed, "Dragon Lines" for Whole-Train Loading/Unloading Increased by Half, Vehicle Turnaround Time Greatly Accelerated
    (Our Dispatch, Tianjin, July 30th) To meet the needs of a large-scale production increase, Tianjin's transportation departments have conducted an overall plan for the city's railway freight yards and dedicated lines, implementing renovations in phases. Currently, the first phase of the project has been completed, and transportation efficiency has significantly improved.
    Tianjin's current renovation of railway freight yards and dedicated lines is being carried out in phases, with a comprehensive plan centered around the city's eight major stations and thirteen major freight yards. They have divided 222 dedicated lines into 35 freight operation areas for coal, building materials, grain, steel ore, chemicals, general merchandise, etc. Loading and unloading machinery is set up according to the type of goods, packaging, weight, and other factors that are frequently loaded and unloaded. This changes the previous situation of mixed goods, disorganized placement, and difficult loading and unloading in freight yards. According to the overall plan, the city will thoroughly renovate 95 dedicated lines, of which 66 dedicated lines will be able to quickly load and unload entire trains after the renovation. This will change the previous situation of independent operations and self-governance, making transportation more rational, giving the freight yards and dedicated lines the function of large-scale loading, unloading, receiving, and dispatching.
    Now, the first phase of the overall renovation project has been completed, and the "dragon lines" for whole-train loading and unloading alone have increased by 50% compared to the original, greatly accelerating the vehicle turnaround time. In the past, the vehicle stopping time at Tianjin Station was eleven or twelve hours, but now it has been shortened to about six hours. After the Yongli Factory's line was renovated, the train was spared detours. The time it takes to enter and exit the factory has been shortened from the original three hours to forty minutes, and raw materials can be directly delivered to the workshop. This will save three thousand railcars a year.
    While implementing the overall railway renovation, Tianjin is actively setting up dedicated modern loading and unloading machinery according to the type of goods, packaging, weight, and heavy pieces to achieve fixed-type, complete-set loading and unloading machinery, which makes the line renovation even better and doubles the effect. For example, belt conveyors are set up in the coal operation area to cooperate with funnel coal bins, high platforms are set up in the steel operation area to cooperate with loading racks, and stacking machines are set up in the timber operation area, etc. Special machines are used for special purposes, reducing relocation time, leveraging the effectiveness of the machines, and improving loading and unloading capabilities. After the existing renovation of the eleven lines in the East Station West Freight Yard in Tianjin, the types of cargo operations have been fixed, and dedicated loading and unloading machinery has been greatly developed. The cargo loading and unloading volume has increased by more than 50% compared with the beginning of this year, and the labor productivity of loading and unloading workers has increased from 14 tons per person at the beginning of the year to 24 tons. Now this freight yard has saved nearly half of the loading and unloading workers.
    The overall renovation of railway freight lines and dedicated lines involves a wide range and a large amount of construction. In order to speed up the progress of the overall renovation, the district secretaries took the lead in establishing "Dragon Line" Renovation Leading Groups and "Dragon Line" Renovation Project Headquarters to strengthen leadership and promote collaboration. They first organized manpower to conduct a detailed investigation and research on the city's freight lines and dedicated lines, and from the perspective of overall interests, adopted methods of demolishing, changing, relocating, extending, and connecting lines, and establishing corresponding high platforms and low cargo locations to formulate an overall renovation plan. During the construction process, all units fully promoted the spirit of cooperation. When Hebei District renovated the Xigu Freight Yard line, 149 factories in the district, while ensuring the completion of their own factory's production tasks, took time out of their spare time to participate in voluntary labor. This district dispatched more than 20,000 workers, students, and commune members one after another and spent 15 days and nights without asking the state for a single rail or a single sleeper, transforming the original seven short lines of Xigu Freight Yard into three whole-train loading and unloading lines and one half-train loading and unloading line, expanding the original 150 cargo locations to more than 350.

    天津改造铁路线增加运输量
    第一期工程已经完成，整列装卸“龙道”增加一半，车辆周转时间大大加快
    本报天津30日电　天津市交通运输部门适应生产大幅度增产需要，对全市的铁路货场与专用线进行了总体规划，分期改造。目前，第一期工程已经完成，运输效能有了显著的提高。
    天津市这次改造铁路货场和专用线，是以全市八个主要车站，十三个主要货场为中心，全面规划分期进行的。他们把二百二十二条专用线划分为煤炭、建筑材料、粮食、钢铁矿石、化工、百杂货等三十五个货运作业区，按着经常装卸的货物种类、包装、轻重等，设置装卸搬运机械，这样就可以改变过去货场的货物混杂，摆放零乱，不易装卸的状况。根据总体规划，全市要对九十五条专用线进行彻底改造，其中有六十六条专用线在改造后能够快速整列装卸，改变过去各立门户，各自为政的状况，使运输更加合理，这样就使货场与专用线具有大装大卸大接大排的功能。
    现在，第一期总体改造工程已经完成，仅整列装卸的“龙道”就比原来增加50％，大大加快了车辆周转时间。过去天津站车辆停站时间，是十一、二个小时，现在缩短到六小时左右；永利厂的线路改造后，火车免除了绕道运行，进出厂一次由原来的三小时，缩短到四十分钟，而且原料可以直接送到车间。一年就可节省三千个车皮。
    天津市实行铁路总体改造的同时，按着装卸货物种类、包装、轻重件等的不同，积极设置专用的现代化的装卸搬运机，大搞装卸机械的定型成龙配套，使线路改造锦上添花，效果倍增。如在煤炭作业区设置了皮带输送机配合漏斗煤仓，钢铁作业区设置了高站台配合装车架，木材作业区设置了归垛机等等，专机专用，减少了移放时间，发挥了机具的效能，提高了装卸能力。天津市东站西货场在现有改造后十一条线路上固定了货物作业种类，大搞专用装卸机具，货物装卸量比今年年初提高50％以上，装卸工人的劳动生产率由年初的每人十四吨提高到二十四吨。现在这个货场已节约出装卸工人将近一半。
    铁路货物线、专用线的总体改造涉及面广，工程量大。为了加快总体改造的进度，各区都是书记挂帅，成立了“龙道”改造领导小组和“龙道”改造工程指挥部，加强领导，大搞协作。他们首先组织人力对全市货物线、专用线作了细致的调查和研究，从整体利益出发采取了拆除、改变、迁移、延长、连接线路和建立相应的高站台、低货位的办法，制定了总体改造规划。在施工过程中，各个单位都充分发扬了协作精神。河北区改造西沽货场线路时，全区有一百四十九个工厂在保证完成本厂生产任务的前提下，抽出业余时间参加义务劳动，这个区先后出动了职工、学生、社员达两万多人次，用了十五昼夜的时间，没向国家要一根钢轨、一根枕木，把西沽货场原有七条短线，改造为三条整列装卸线和一条半列装卸线，使原来一百五十多个货位扩展到三百五十多个。
