Humans Can Live to Be Over One Hundred and Fifty Years Old
　　Gao Shiqi

　　Life on Earth began as far back as 500 million years ago. The earliest life appeared in the primitive oceans in the form of protein molecules.

　　Later, more and more primitive organisms, including bacteria, algae, and the single-celled animal group led by amoebas, appeared on the stage of life one after another.

　　These primitive organisms all reproduce by cell division, and the life of the parent body ends after one parent cell becomes two daughter cells. Therefore, their lifespans are extremely short, only to be calculated in days or hours, the shortest being only fifteen minutes.

　　When single-celled animals evolved into multicellular animals, their lifespans also lengthened.

　　For example, the familiar earthworm can live up to ten years. A large clam in the Indian Ocean, weighing 300 kilograms, is known as the king of mollusks and has created the highest lifespan record in the invertebrate world, living up to 100 years.

　　Generally speaking, insects have very short lifespans. Mayflies, which fly in swarms on rivers and lakes, are famous for their short lives. Their adult insects only live for a few hours, but their larvae can live in water for several years.

　　The lifespan of a dragonfly is only one or two months, while its larvae can live for about a year; the lifespan of a cicada is only a few weeks, while its larvae can spend as long as seventeen years in the soil.

　　The lifespan of fish is much longer. The large carp seen in the release pond of Yongquan Temple on Mount Gu in Fuzhou are said to be animals over a hundred years old; the goldfish cultivated in Yuquan of West Lake in Hangzhou are also over thirty years old.

　　Among the ranks of long-lived animals, the lifespan of turtles is considered the longest. The London Zoo in England keeps a giant turtle, which may still be alive, and is already over three hundred years old. It is said that African crocodiles can also reach such an advanced age.

　　Animals that reach over 100 years old also include eagles, swans, elephants, and other rare animals; the lifespan of general birds of prey, beasts, and domestic poultry and livestock is between ten and fifty or sixty years.

　　In general, they cannot live out their natural lifespan, either being slaughtered and eaten to meet human nutritional needs or starving to death due to old age and weakness.

　　As for the average human lifespan, in the dark Middle Ages, it was only twenty to thirty years, which is worse than many higher animals.

　　After the Renaissance, this statistic has been continuously increasing. Now, in many socialist countries, the average lifespan of people has reached the standard of sixty to seventy years, which is higher than the lifespan of general animals.

　　Residents of Eastern European countries are famous for their longevity. For example, in Bulgaria, there are 555 people aged one hundred and above per million people.

　　There was an old farmer in the Soviet Union named Ayvazov, who lived to be 148 years old and was still very healthy. He was the father of twenty-three children, three of whom were over one hundred years old. His family had more than 150 people. This is an outstanding example. (He passed away last year at the age of 152)

　　Under the capitalist system, especially in colonial and semi-colonial countries, the situation is completely different. The lives of working people there are not guaranteed, and many live in slums. Hunger and disease constantly threaten their survival, and premature aging and death are everywhere. As for those rich people, they live a life of extravagance and debauchery. I don't think they will live long either.

　　In our socialist country, care for people begins even before they are born. As a result, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and various health care systems have been established. Nurseries and kindergartens, sanatoriums and convalescent homes are blooming everywhere. The Party and the government are also vigorously promoting sports to enhance the people's physique. All of this has a profound impact on extending the average lifespan of the people.

　　With the advancement of medicine and the development of the patriotic health movement, infectious diseases that endanger humanity are gradually being eliminated. Even that terrible cancer is nearing its end.

　　In recent years, the soda bath suggested by Soviet scientist Lepeshinskaya and the injection of Novocaine advocated by Romanian scientist A. Aslan, although their effects have not been definitively concluded, have played an encouraging role in the fight against aging. These new methods have brought us new hope. It is not an overly optimistic estimate to say that humans can live to be over one hundred and fifty years old, and that this is not the limit of human lifespan!

    人能活到一百五十岁以上
    高士其
    地球上的生命活动，远在五万万年以前就开始了。最初的生命，是以蛋白质分子的身份出现在原始的海洋里。
    往后，越来越多的原始生物，包括细菌、藻类和以变形虫为首的单细胞动物集团，一批又一批地登上生命的舞台。
    这些原始生物，都是用分裂的方法来繁殖自己的后代的，一个母细胞变成两个子细胞之后，母体的生命就结束了。所以它们的寿命都极短暂，只能以天数或小时来计算，最短的只有十五分钟。
    当单细胞动物进化到多细胞动物，寿命也就延长了。
    例如大家所熟悉的蚯蚓，就能活到十年之久。印度洋中有一种大贝壳，重三百公斤，被称作软体动物之王，在无脊椎动物世界里，创造了最高的寿命纪录，能活到一百岁。
    一般说来，昆虫的寿命都很短促，成群结队飞游在河面湖面的蜉蝣，就是以短命而著名的，它们的成虫只活几小时，可是它们的幼虫却能在水中活上几年。
    蜻蜓的寿命只有一两个月，它们的幼虫能活上一年左右；蝉的寿命只有几个星期，而它们的幼虫竟能在土里渡过十七年的光阴。
    鱼类的寿命就长得多了。在福州鼓山涌泉寺放生池里所见到的大鲤鱼，据说都是一百年以上的动物；杭州西湖玉泉所培养的金鱼，也都有三十岁以上的年纪了。
    在长寿动物的行列中，乌龟的寿命要算最长的了。英国伦敦动物园里保存着一只巨大的乌龟，也许现在还活着，它的年纪已经超过三百岁了。听说非洲的鳄鱼，也能达到这样的高龄。
    达到一百岁以上的动物，还有苍鹰、天鹅、象以及其他少数罕见的动物；一般猛禽野兽和家禽家畜之类，它们的寿命都在十岁到五、六十岁之间。
    在一般的情况下，它们都不能终其天年，要不为了人类营养的需要而被宰吃；要不因为年老力衰得不到食物而饿死。
    至于人类的平均寿命，在黑暗的中世纪，只有二十到三十岁，这比许多高等动物还不如。
    文艺复兴以后，这个统计数字不断地在增长着。现在有许多社会主义国家里，人民的平均寿命都已经达到六十到七十岁的标准，这个标准比一般动物的寿命都要高。
    东欧国家的居民，是著名的长寿者，例如在保加利亚，每一百万人中，就有五百五十五人是百岁和百岁以上的老人。
    苏联有一个老农民叫做艾瓦佐夫，他活到一百四十八岁，还很健康，他是二十三个儿子的爸爸，其中有三个儿子已经超过了一百岁，他的家庭就有一百五十多口人。这是一个突出的例子。（他已于去年逝世，享年一百五十二岁）
    在资本主义制度下，尤其是在殖民地和半殖民地的国家里，情况就完全两样。那儿劳动人民的生活没有保障，很多人都住在贫民窟里，饥饿和疾病时刻威胁着他们的生存，早衰早死的现象到处都是。而那些富人呢，过着花天酒地、荒淫无度的生活，我想他们也活不了多久。
    在我们社会主义国家里，对于人的关怀，是从他的诞生前就开始的，因而婴儿的死亡率大大下降，各种保健制度都已建立起来，托儿所和幼儿园，休养所和疗养院，遍地开花，党和政府又大力提倡体育运动，以增强人民的体质。这一切，对于延长人民的平均寿命，都具有深远的影响。
    随着医学的进步，爱国卫生运动的发展，危害人类的传染病逐渐消灭，就是那可怕的癌病，也日暮途穷了。
    近年来，苏联科学家勒柏辛斯卡娅所建议的洗苏打浴和罗马尼亚科学家阿·那·阿斯兰提倡的注射奴佛卡因，它们的效果如何，虽然没有作出最后的结论，但它们对于征服衰老的斗争，起了令人鼓舞的作用。这些新方法给我们带来了新的希望。人能活到一百五十岁以上，还不是人类寿命的极限。这句话，不能说是过份乐观的估计吧！
