News in Brief

    Guangdong Develops Coal Industry at High Speed
    Guangdong Province is vigorously developing a mass movement, adopting the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises to accelerate the development of the coal industry. The province's raw coal production in 1959 increased more than five times compared to 1957; the output from January to June this year increased by 41.6% compared to the same period last year. The situation in which Guangdong industry relied on transporting coal from the north has greatly changed, and most of the coal needed by the metallurgical industry, power industry, light industry, and transportation departments, which consume the most coal, is now supplied by the province itself.

    "Top Leaders" Focus on Tunneling
    In order to ensure sustained leaps forward in the second half of the year, the Jiaohe Coal Mine in Jilin Province is focusing on production preparation work centered on tunneling. The mine's Party committee decided to send "top leaders" from the mine level down to the team level to focus on tunneling work. After the leading cadres went down, they criticized the thinking of some cadres who emphasized coal mining over tunneling, and also actively solved specific problems in the tunneling work. The total amount of main roadway tunneling in the mine exceeded the plan for the first half of July by 10.1%; coal production also exceeded the plan for the first half of the month by 5.3%.

    Strengthening Leadership over the Mining Industry
    Since the second quarter, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and industrial leading departments have continuously taken measures to promote a great leap forward in the mining industry. The provincial committee organized working groups, from the secretary of the provincial party committee to the heads of relevant departments, commissions, offices, and bureaus, all of whom went deep into key enterprises such as the mines affiliated with Kunming Iron and Steel Plant and Yipinglang Coal Mine to inspect production, direct production, and help strengthen the political and ideological work of the mines and improve enterprise management. Leading Party cadres at all levels in various regions also went deep into mines and pits to lead production.

    Major Inspection of Production and Living Conditions at Mines and Construction Sites
    The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently drew more than 300 cadres from provincial-level industrial, transportation, commercial, grain, finance, banking, health, political and legal, trade union, and Communist Youth League departments to form mine and construction site production and living inspection groups. These groups went to nine regions, including Jiangjin, Mianyang, and Wanxian, to carry out inspection work together with the inspection sub-groups and inspection teams organized by local and county party committees. The focus of the inspection was on coal mines, iron plants, and key railway construction sites. The purpose of the inspection was to promote the practical solution of key production problems in various localities, further arrange the lives of workers and staff, and ensure a greater leap forward in production and construction.

    Three Counties Jointly Run Iron and Steel "Small Indigenous Federation"
    In Guangxi's Guilin Special District, PingLe, Lipu, and Gongcheng counties are cooperating on a large scale, uniting the original coal, coke, and iron enterprises of each county to establish an iron and steel "small indigenous federation." Under the leadership of the general factory, each factory and mine uniformly allocates manpower and materials, from raw coal and ore production to coke and iron smelting, and from production to transportation, ensuring that one link is tightly connected to another. This has overcome the past phenomena of dispersed factories and mines, limited technical strength and equipment, and insufficient normal production, so that iron and steel production can be better developed.

    Major Inspection Promotes Safe Production
    In order to create better safety conditions to ensure sustained leaps forward in production, industrial, transportation, basic construction, and commercial enterprises in Shanghai are widely carrying out safety inspection campaigns. As of the beginning of this month, more than 3,500 factories and enterprises in the city have conducted safety inspections, and the masses have put forward more than 450,000 opinions and suggestions, more than half of which have been rectified in a timely manner, and safety work has been greatly improved.

    要闻快报
    广东高速度发展煤炭工业
    广东省大搞群众运动，采取土洋并举、大中小型企业并举的方针，加速发展煤炭工业。全省原煤产量，一九五九年比一九五七年猛增五倍多；今年一至六月的产量，又比去年同期增长百分之四十一点六。广东工业依靠北煤南运的局面已有很大改变，耗煤炭最多的冶金工业、电力工业、轻工业和交通运输部门所需的煤炭，大部分已由省内自给。
    “头把手”抓掘进
    吉林省蛟河煤矿为了保证下半年持续跃进，狠抓以掘进为中心的生产准备工作。矿党委决定，从矿到班，都派出“头把手”抓掘进工作。各级领导干部下去以后，一方面批判部分干部重采煤、轻掘进的思想，一方面切实解决掘进工作中的具体问题。全矿主巷掘进总量超额百分之十点一完成了七月上半月的计划；煤产量也超额百分之五点三完成了上半月计划。
    加强对采掘工业的领导
    第二季度以来，中共云南省委和工业领导部门就不断采取措施，力促采掘工业大跃进。省委组织了工作团，从省委书记处书记到各有关部、委、厅、局的负责人，都分别深入到昆明钢铁厂所属矿山、一平浪煤矿等重点企业检查生产，指挥生产，帮助加强矿山的政治思想工作，改善企业管理。各地区各级党的领导干部，也纷纷深入矿山、坑口领导生产。
    矿山、工地生产生活大检查
    中共四川省委最近由省级工业、交通、商业、粮食、财政、银行、卫生、政法、工会、共青团等部门抽调了三百多名干部，组成矿山、工地生产、生活检查团，分赴江津、绵阳、万县等九个地区，同各地、县委组织的检查分团和检查小组一起开展检查工作。检查的重点是煤矿、铁厂和重点铁路建设工地。检查的目的是要推动各地切切实实地解决生产关键问题，进一步安排职工生活，保证生产、建设的更大跃进。
    三县合办钢铁“小土联”
    广西桂林专区平乐、荔浦、恭城三县大协作，把各县原有的煤、焦、铁企业联合在一起建立了钢铁“小土联”。各厂矿在总厂的领导下，统一调配人力、物力，从原煤、矿石生产到炼焦、炼铁，从生产到运输，作到一环紧扣一环。这样便克服了过去因为厂矿分散、技术力量和设备有限，生产不够正常的现象，使钢铁生产更好地发展。
    大检查促进安全生产
    上海市工业、交通运输、基本建设和商业企业，为了创造更好的安全条件保证生产持续跃进，正在广泛开展安全检查运动。到本月上旬为止，全市已有三千五百多个工厂企业进行了安全检查，群众提出的意见和建议有四十五万多条，其中半数以上已经及时整改，安全工作有了很大改进。
