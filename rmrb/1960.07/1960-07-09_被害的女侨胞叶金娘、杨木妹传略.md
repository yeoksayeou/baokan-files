Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th: The Overseas Chinese in Tjimahi, West Java, Indonesia, have formed a funeral committee for the deceased Overseas Chinese women Ye Jinniang and Yang Mumei and published biographies of the two deceased.

Ye Jinniang and Yang Mumei were shot and killed by armed soldiers on July 3rd when the Indonesian Army authorities forcibly relocated Overseas Chinese from Tjimahi.

The biography of Ye Jinniang states that she was born on June 15, 1915, in a poor peasant family in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, and was a skilled cultivator from a young age. She married Lin Yu in 1934. In 1937, she went to Indonesia and continued to help her husband cultivate the land (her husband ran a vegetable garden), contributing her expertise to Indonesia's cultivation industry. Now, she has been brutally murdered in an activity orchestrated by powerful groups in Indonesia to force the relocation of Overseas Chinese, leaving behind ten children. Ye Jinniang had planned to take her children back to China soon to pursue further education and participate in socialist agricultural construction herself. Her ambition was not fulfilled, which is heartbreaking.

The biography of Yang Mumei states that she was born on May 3, 1922, in Fuqing County, Fujian Province. In 1932, she followed her father to Indonesia. Yang Mumei's family was poor when she was young, and she could not attend school, but she was able to use her spare time to study and had a considerable cultural foundation. She married Lin Dunhua in 1942. Yang Mumei was not only diligent and thrifty in managing her household but also lived in harmony with her neighbors, which was praised by the local people. Now, she has unfortunately met with misfortune. Yang Mumei was four months pregnant when she was tragically killed, leaving behind eight children.

    被害的女侨胞叶金娘、杨木妹传略
    新华社8日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚西爪哇芝马圩的华侨为死难华侨妇女叶金娘、杨木妹组成的治丧委员会发表了两位死者的传略。
    叶金娘和杨木妹是在印度尼西亚陆军当局3日强迫芝马圩华侨迁移时被武装军人枪杀的。
    关于叶金娘的传略说，叶金娘在1915年6月15日生于福建省福清县的一个贫农家里，自幼就是耕耘能手。1934年与林玉结婚。1937年到印度尼西亚，仍然帮助丈夫耕作（丈夫经营菜园），把特长贡献给印度尼西亚的耕植业，而今竟在印度尼西亚有势力集团策划的逼迁华侨的活动中被惨杀，遗下儿女十人。叶金娘本拟于最近携儿女返国升学，自己参加社会主义农业建设，壮志未竟，令人痛心疾首。
    关于杨木妹的传略说，杨木妹在1922年5月3日生于福建省福清县，1932年随父到印度尼西亚。杨木妹幼时家贫，无法升学，但能利用工余补习，有相当文化基础。1942年与林敦华结婚。杨木妹平素不但勤俭持家，且与邻里和睦相处，为当地人士所称道，今不幸遭难。杨木妹惨遭杀害时，已怀孕四月，遗下儿女八人。
