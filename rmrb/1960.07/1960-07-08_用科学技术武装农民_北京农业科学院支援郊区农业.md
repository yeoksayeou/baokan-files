    Arming Farmers with Science and Technology
    Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences Supports Suburban Agriculture
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences resolutely implements the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on scientific research serving suburban agricultural production. Based on local characteristics and closely integrated with the needs of production, the Academy mobilizes scientific and technical personnel to go to the countryside and combine with farmers, and cooperates with relevant units to carry out mass agricultural scientific research activities, vigorously supporting the technological transformation of suburban agriculture and the development of production with science and technology, and has made remarkable achievements.
    In the first half of this year, the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted more than 70 major scientific research projects on field crops, agricultural machinery, vegetables, animal husbandry, fruit trees, aquaculture, soil and fertilizer, and beekeeping. These projects all addressed important issues and new technologies in local agricultural and livestock production, and most of them directly served agricultural production. They linked up with more than 970 experimental sites in suburban counties (districts) and people's communes. Most of these scientific research projects were carried out in conjunction with high-yield fields, high-yield livestock and poultry groups, and high-yield trees. More than one-third of the Academy's scientific and technical personnel went to more than 20 people's communes and farms with instruments and medicines, living, producing, and researching with the farmers for a long time. At the same time, the eight research institutes (offices) under the Academy also regularly sent scientific and technical personnel to the experimental sites of various people's communes to provide technical guidance and conduct investigations and research. They mobilized the vast number of farmers to participate in scientific research activities, and a mass agricultural scientific research network has been formed in the entire suburbs.
    Scientific and technical personnel and farmers, together with agricultural production, carried out mass scientific research activities, which played a significant role in solving problems in local agricultural production, improving the level of agricultural production, and promoting agricultural technological transformation. According to the characteristics of suburban agriculture serving the city, they actively carried out research on the mechanization of production centered on vegetable production and pig raising, and successfully trial-produced 43 kinds of machinery. These new machines greatly improved labor productivity. The working volume of a land leveler suspended by a 25-horsepower tractor in one day is equivalent to the workload of more than 70 manual laborers. The ridge-making seeder makes ridges and sows seeds at the same time, increasing production efficiency by about 140 times. In order to ensure that the capital's vegetable supply is available all year round and diversified, they have also made great achievements in testing and researching the seasonal allocation of different varieties of vegetables for production and early maturity. They have also found new ways to solve the feed problem for the large-scale development of pig production in the suburbs. The experimental research on algae and fungal pig feeds such as Chlorella, geosmin, Neurospora, and acidophilic bacteria preparations has achieved great results. According to the experiment of adding Chlorella concentrate to each pig every day for about two weeks, under the same conditions, the daily weight gain of ordinary pigs with Chlorella concentrate added was 81% to 107% higher than that of ordinary pigs without Chlorella concentrate added. They supplied more than 330 units of Chlorella seeds, more than 670 kilograms, and more than 300 tubes of various fungal strains. Under their guidance, more than 940 places in various people's communes in the suburbs have begun to produce algae and fungal pig feeds. The breeding and fattening period of Beijing ducks has also been shortened from more than 80 days to 60 days through experiments. Because these experimental studies were carried out under the leadership of the municipal, county (district), and local people's commune party committees, scientific and technical personnel and farmers worked together, so they are not only more suitable for the needs of production, but also, once the experimental research is successful, they hold on-site meetings, etc., to promote them in a timely manner, and one result blooms everywhere.
    In different production seasons, the Academy also frequently organizes the scientific and technological forces of relevant scientific research units and universities in the central government and Beijing Municipality, and adopts the method of large-scale collaboration to conduct large-scale investigations and research on major key issues in current production, propose specific measures, and help summarize experiences, etc., to guide production in a timely and comprehensive manner. In the comprehensive summary of the pig raising experience in the suburbs, they mobilized and organized more than 30 scientific and technical personnel from more than 20 units, went deep into more than 100 pig farms in the suburbs, visited more than 500 advanced pig raising workers and experienced breeders, and together with them, compiled a 230,000-word "Beijing Pig Raising Science."
    They also take various forms to actively train various agricultural technical talents for the people's communes in the suburbs. Since the beginning of this year, they have cooperated with relevant departments to hold more than 10 short-term training courses in animal husbandry, vegetables, fish farming, and beekeeping, and have trained thousands of technical personnel and production backbones in these areas for the people's communes in the suburbs.

    用科学技术武装农民
    北京农业科学院支援郊区农业
    新华社讯　北京市农业科学院坚决贯彻中共北京市委关于科学研究为郊区农业生产服务的指示，根据当地特点，紧密结合生产需要，发动科学技术人员下乡和农民结合，和有关单位大协作，开展群众性的农业科学研究活动，以科学技术大力支援郊区农业技术改造和生产的发展，做出了显著的成绩。
    今年上半年，北京市农业科学院在对大田作物、农业机械、蔬菜、畜牧、果树、水产、土壤肥料、养蜂等方面所进行的七十多项主要科学研究项目，都是当地农业和牧业生产中的重要问题和新技术的研究，大多数直接服务于农业生产。他们和郊区各县（区）、人民公社的九百七十多个试验点挂了钩，这些科学研究项目大多是结合丰产田、畜禽丰产群、丰产树等进行的。全院有三分之一以上的科学技术人员带着仪器、药品，分别下到二十多个人民公社、农场，长期和农民同生活、同生产、同研究；同时，这个院所属八个研究所（室）还经常派科学技术人员巡回到各人民公社试验点进行技术指导和调查研究。他们发动了广大农民参加科学研究活动，在全郊区已经形成了一个群众性的农业科学研究网。
    科学技术人员和农民一道，结合农业生产，开展群众性科学研究活动，对解决当地农业生产中的问题，提高农业生产水平和促进农业技术改造，发挥了很大的作用。他们根据郊区农业为城市服务的特点，积极开展以蔬菜生产和养猪为中心的生产机械化的研究工作，共研究试制成功了各种机具四十三种。这些新机具使劳动生产率大大提高，用一台二十五马力拖拉机悬挂的平地机，一天工作量相当于七十多个人工的工作量。起垅播种机一边起垅、一边就播种，使生产效率提高一百四十倍左右。为使首都蔬菜供应长年不缺，多样化，他们试验研究蔬菜不同品种四季调配生产和早熟等问题，也有很大成绩。他们还为郊区养猪生产大发展解决饲料问题找到了新的途径。对小球藻、地霉素、链孢霉、嗜酸杆菌剂等藻类、菌类猪饲料的试验研究都取得了很大成效，根据两周左右每天给每头猪加喂小球藻浓缩液的试验，在同等条件下，比不加喂小球藻浓缩液的普通猪每天分别体重增加81％到107％。他们供应了三百三十多单位小球藻种六百七十多斤，各种菌种三百多管，在他们指导下，现在全郊区各人民公社已有九百四十多处开始进行藻类、菌类猪饲料的生产。北京鸭的育成育肥期，也经试验由八十多天缩短到六十天。由于这些试验研究都是在市、县（区）和当地人民公社党委领导下，科学技术人员和农民一起进行的，因此不仅更适合生产的需要，而且一经试验研究成功，就召开现场会等，及时推广，一处结果，四面开花。
    在不同生产季节，这个院还经常大规模地组织中央和北京市有关科学研究单位、高等学校的科学技术力量，采取大协作的方法，对当前生产中的重大关键问题进行大面积调查研究，提出具体措施，以及帮助总结经验等，及时地全面地指导生产。在全面总结郊区养猪经验中，他们发动和组织了二十多个单位三十多名科学技术人员，深入郊区一百多个猪场，访问了五百多名养猪先进工作者和有经验的饲养人员，和他们一起，编写出了一本二十三万字的“北京养猪学”。
    他们还采取各种形式积极为郊区各人民公社培养各种农业技术人才。今年以来，他们协同有关部门举办了畜牧、蔬菜、养鱼、养蜂等十多次短期训练班，为郊区各人民公社培养了上千名这些方面的技术人员和生产骨干。（附图片）
