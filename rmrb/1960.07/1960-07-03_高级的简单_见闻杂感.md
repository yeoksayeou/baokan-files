    Advanced Simplicity
    ——Observations and Reflections
    Gu Ming
    During my recent stay in Xi'an, I heard a refreshing phrase from a journalist comrade: "advanced simplicity."

    While visiting the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, through concrete observations, we gained a deeper understanding of the term "advanced simplicity." In the past, the factory's blanking workshop required three manual operations to form iron sheets into shapes. Whether making basins or mugs, it involved repeated pressing until the final shape was achieved. After technological innovation, the blanking workers in this factory not only replaced the three manual operations with machinery but also connected the three processes into a linked production line using conveyor belts. Standing before this linked production line, watching the process of pressing iron sheets flow as naturally as water, we felt the wisdom of the masses of workers who had liberated their minds was truly abundant and ingenious!

    However, the Party Secretary of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory told us confidently that they were still studying how to combine the three processes into one, creating a special mold for pressing mugs and basins. The iron sheet is placed on it and pressed into shape all at once on a pressing machine, completing the three processes in one go. In this way, the linked production line would no longer be needed, efficiency would be greatly improved, and two pressing machines could be saved.

    The merging of the three blanking processes into one, as mentioned here, represents advanced simplicity from complexity. Many modern technical equipment and machinery are complex, but after workers and technicians engaged in large-scale technological innovation and revolution, by giving full play to the wisdom of the broad masses and using some creative methods, without adding any complex mechanical equipment, a transformation from low-level simplicity to advanced simplicity was achieved. Examples of this are numerous.

    China's technological innovation and technological revolution have entered a new high tide. Many factories are simplifying mechanical equipment, merging technological processes, reducing factory buildings in size, making equipment lighter, reducing the number of parts, simplifying technology, and reducing metal cutting. Metal cutting is being changed from multi-tool multi-edge to no cutting processing, while efficiency is being improved from low to high. All of this shows that our technological innovation and technological revolution are stepping up to the sky or stepping up to the sky in one step towards "advanced simplicity."

    The creation process of "advanced simplicity" is actually not simple. This kind of "advanced simplicity" can only be achieved under the leadership of the Party, by liberating the mind, breaking superstitions, and fully mobilizing the masses. Those who blindly believe in foreign things, those who believe that "high, big, precise, cutting-edge, and new" are complex and unattainable, they don't even think about the words "advanced simplicity," and naturally, they have no part in creating it.

      "Advanced simplicity" is an advanced development in terms of technical equipment and process operations. This is a great creation of the Chinese people in the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. It powerfully shatters the superstition and myth that science and technology are unattainable.

### 高级的简单——见闻杂感

    高级的简单
    ——见闻杂感
    顾明
    这次在西安呆了几天，从一位记者同志那里听到一个很新鲜的词儿：“高级的简单”。
    我们在参观西安人民搪瓷厂的过程中，通过了具体的观察，对“高级的简单”这个词儿，理解得也就更深刻了一层。这个厂的制坯车间过去把铁皮压制成型，要经过三道手工操作工序，不论是做脸盆、做口杯，都是一次又一次的压延，最后才成型。技术革新之后，这家厂的制坯工人除了把制坯的三道手工操作都以机械代替之外，接着又用传送带把三道工序连接成一条联动线。当我们站在这个联动线面前，看到压制铁皮的一道道工序在像流水一样自然地转动时，我们感觉到解放了思想的工人群众的智慧是多么丰富而又巧妙啊！
    可是西安人民搪瓷厂的党委书记满怀信心地告诉我们，他们还在研究把三道工序合并成一次来进行，创造了一个特制口杯和脸盆压模，把铁皮放上去，在一部压车上一下子就压制成型，把三道工序一次完成。这样联动线也就根本用不着了，效率大大提高了，压车也可节省两部。
    这里所说的三道制坯工序并为一道，就是由复杂到高级的简单。有好些现代技术设备机械很复杂，可是在工人群众和技术人员大搞技术革新和技术革命之后，由于充分发挥了广大群众的智慧，用了一些创造性的办法，不用增加什么复杂的机械设备，一下子就由低级的简单达到高级的简单。这样的例子也是举不胜举的。
    我国技术革新和技术革命已经进入了一个新的高潮。许多工厂都正在简化机械设备，合并工艺过程，厂房由大改小，设备由重改轻，零件由多改少，技术由复杂改为简单，金属切削也由多刀多刃，改为不需要切削加工，而效率则由低改高。凡此种种，都说明我们的技术革新和技术革命正在步步登天或一步登天地走向“高级的简单”。
    “高级的简单”的创造过程实际是并不简单的。这种“高级的简单”是只有在党领导下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，充分发动群众之后才能做到的。凡是迷信洋的，凡是认为“高、大、精、尖、新”都是复杂而高不可攀的人，他们连“高级的简单”这几个字想也不想的，创造，自然更没有他们的份儿。
      “高级的简单”，这是在技术设备和工艺操作方面的高级的发展，这是我国人民在技术革新和技术革命群众运动中的伟大创造，它有力地粉碎了科学技术高不可攀的迷信和神话。
