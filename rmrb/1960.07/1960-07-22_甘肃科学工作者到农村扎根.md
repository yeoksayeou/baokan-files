Gansu's scientific and technical personnel are climbing mountains and ridges to find water sources. Meteorological workers are exploring experiences in artificial rainmaking, hail suppression, and frost prevention. Chemical workers are actively creating new pesticides and fertilizers. Agricultural scientific workers are creating and imitating new agricultural implements and conducting experiments on mountain mechanization.

(By Our Newspaper) Gansu Province's science and technology departments, with the support of agriculture's high-speed development as the center, are vigorously carrying out scientific research, which has not only promoted agricultural production but also enriched scientific research.

Guided by the idea that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, the broad masses of scientific and technical workers in Gansu Province have conscientiously implemented the policy of scientific research closely integrating with production to serve socialist construction. Since the beginning of this year, they have launched a massive, solid, and comprehensive upsurge in supporting agriculture. Scientific and technical personnel climb mountains and ridges to find water sources for farmers; meteorological workers actively make climate forecasts, explore experiences and methods in artificial rainmaking, artificial hail suppression, and frost prevention, and help farmers overcome natural disasters; chemical workers actively create new pesticides and fertilizers, and conduct soil improvement experiments; agricultural scientific workers and technical departments conduct research on breeding improved varieties and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, summarize and improve experiences and ways to increase yield per unit area, create and imitate new agricultural implements, and conduct experiments on mountain mechanization to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture.

The broad masses of scientific and technical personnel have gone to the countryside to take root, carry out mass scientific research activities with the broad masses of commune members, and solve major problems in current agricultural production, and have made outstanding achievements. In the struggle against drought production and natural disasters, the Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology, and other units have worked with local commune members in Zhangye and Dingxi areas to melt ice and snow and find underground water sources. The Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology and the people's communes in Zhangye area organized a melting ice team of more than 1,700 people to carry out melting ice and snow work on the Qilian Mountains at an altitude of more than 4,500 meters. Now, they have melted more than 70 million cubic meters of ice, irrigating many farmlands. The Institute of Geology has found underground water in Tongwei and other places in Dingxi area, and has drilled more than 1,500 wells for the production teams of the local people's communes, which have irrigated more than 7,000 mu of land. The Institute of Geophysics, together with the meteorological department, used various methods to artificially rain 270,000 cubic meters in Lintan, Huajialing, and other areas, which can meet the irrigation of more than 4,600 mu of farmland at a time. The Gansu Meteorological Institute has summarized the experience of artificial hail suppression over the years, formed a one-stop hail suppression work, and found four major hail nests and twelve hail movement routes in Gansu, and initially figured out the scientific methods of hail formation and development law and hail forecast. In May and June, it has prevented large-scale hail attacks four times, so that a large number of crops were spared from losses.

The Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Gansu Agricultural University have also cultivated and introduced various crop varieties. In terms of soil improvement, scientific workers in Dingxi area organized a saline-alkali land improvement and utilization group to go deep into the fields and summarize the experience of soil improvement with the masses, providing a scientific basis for large-scale soil improvement in the future. The Pingliang Soil and Water Conservation Station studied and adopted the method of blasting to build terraced fields, which increased the content of soil available nitrogen fertilizer by 114%.

    甘肃科学工作者到农村扎根
    技术人员爬山越岭寻找水源，气象工作者探索人工降雨、消雹和防霜的经验，化学工作者积极创制新农药和化肥，农业科学工作者创造和仿制新农具，并进行山地机械化的实验
    本报讯　甘肃省科学技术部门以支援农业高速度发展为中心，大搞科学研究，既促进了农业生产，又丰富了科学研究。
    甘肃省广大科学技术工作者在农业是国民经济发展的基础的思想指导下，认真贯彻了科学研究紧密结合生产为社会主义建设服务的方针，今年以来掀起了一个声势浩大、扎扎实实的全面支援农业的高潮。科学技术人员爬山越岭为农民寻找水源；气象工作者积极做好气候预报，探索人工降雨、人工消雹、防霜等经验和方法，帮助农民战胜自然灾害；化学工作者积极创制新农药、化肥，并进行土壤改良的实验；农业科学工作者和技术部门进行选育良种、防治病虫害的研究、总结提高单位面积产量的经验和途径、创造和仿制新式农具、进行山地机械化的实验，以加速农业的技术改造。
    广大科学技术人员到农村去扎根，与广大社员一道开展群众性的科学研究活动，解决当前农业生产中的重大问题，已做出了突出的成绩。在抗旱生产与自然灾害作斗争中，中国科学院兰州地质研究所、冰川冻土研究所等单位分别在张掖、定西专区，跟当地社员一起进行融冰化雪、寻找地下水源的工作。冰川冻土研究所与张掖专区各人民公社组织了一千七百多人的融冰队伍，到海拔四千五百多米的祁连山上进行融冰化雪工作。现在，他们已融冰七千多万方，灌溉了许多农田。地质研究所在定西专区通渭等地寻找地下水，为当地人民公社的生产队打井一千五百多眼，已灌溉土地七千多亩。地球物理研究所与气象部门一起在临潭、华家岭一带，利用各种方法人工降雨二十七万立方米，可满足四千六百多亩农田一次灌溉。甘肃气象研究所总结了历年来人工消雹的经验，形成消雹工作一条龙，并寻找出甘肃主要冰窝四处，冰雹移动路线十二条，初步摸清了冰雹形成发展规律以及预报冰雹的科学方法，在5、6两月内已防止大区域性的冰雹袭击四次，使大量农作物免受损失。
    甘肃农业科学院与甘肃省农业大学还培养和引进了各种农作物品种。在土壤改良方面，定西专区的科学工作者组织了盐碱地改良利用小组，深入田间，与群众一起，总结改良土壤的经验，为今后大规模改良土壤，提供了科学根据。平凉水土保持站研究采用爆破修梯田的办法，使土壤速效性氮肥含量提高了114％。
