Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram A technical innovation movement of "everyone engaging in innovation, everything engaging in innovation" is widely unfolding in Lhasa's industrial and mining enterprises, construction sites, transportation and other departments in Tibet.

    The Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Tibet. A technical innovation committee was specially established to lead this work. In the past half month, on-site meetings have been held successively in seven units including the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory. Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, Guo Xilan and others participated in the on-site meetings and visited the innovation achievements of various units.

    The technical innovation movement in various departments has achieved great results. After learning from the advanced experience of the mainland, a construction site has realized the railization and vehicleization of horizontal transportation on the construction site and the winchization of vertical transportation. The efficiency of plastering has increased nine times compared with the past, and the bricklaying speed has also increased sharply from 2,000 bricks per person per day in the past to 11,000 bricks per person per day. In the timber processing plant of the Lhasa Construction Engineering Office, all processes from logs to cutting, planing, inking, drilling, and tenoning are fully mechanized. The workers stand next to the machines, reach out to take materials from the conveyor belt, complete the work they want to do, and then send the semi-finished products to the next process through the conveyor belt, increasing the efficiency sevenfold compared with the past. Since the second quarter, the Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Bureau employees have completed 235 innovation projects, 85% of which have been applied in production. They used conveyor belts to replace manual telegram transmission, shortening the transmission time from three minutes to twelve seconds each time, and also saving two manpower. They installed automatic alarm stations and automatic controllers on the receiving stations, effectively eliminating the phenomenon of telecommunications interruptions. Some larger canteens in Lhasa are currently promoting gasification and vaporization, and have realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in vegetable cutting, rice washing, dough mixing, and flour milling.

    The drivers in the transportation department overcame the difficulties of many mountains, steep slopes, and slippery roads on the Tibetan plateau, and successively implemented trailer transportation to improve transportation efficiency. Driver Zang Yingzhou also used the trailer he successfully trial-produced to complete 45,312 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks in June, exceeding the original plan by 174%. Each fleet also universally achieved "second-level maintenance on time" and "major repairs within days" for automobiles, and focused on solving the problem of fuel saving for automobiles.

    In the technical innovation, various departments have universally implemented the spirit of indigenous methods, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on indigenous methods, and using local materials as much as possible, striving to spend no money or less money. Scrap copper and iron, waste wood left over from processing, paper scraps, and broken gasoline drums have been utilized. For example, some parts of the automatic controller and automatic alarm in the Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Bureau are made of canned food cans and film boxes. Employees also used scrapped hand-cranked generators that were put into storage to convert them into electric motors. The employees of the timber processing plant used waste wood, shavings, and sawdust left over from processing to make wood-wool boards, wood-chip boards, and particleboards with sound insulation and heat preservation properties. The employees of the Lhasa Housing Construction Team used local materials such as river sand, loess, gypsum, wood chips, and lime to successfully trial-produce cold bricks. These cold bricks do not need to be fired and can be used to build walls and repair stoves. Their pressure resistance and water resistance are no worse than fired bricks.

### 拉萨各部门广泛开展技术革命运动

    拉萨各部门广泛开展技术革命运动
    新华社拉萨电　一个“人人闹革新，事事闹革新”的技术革新运动，正在西藏拉萨的工矿企业、建筑工地和交通运输等各部门中广泛展开。
    中共西藏工委十分重视西藏地区的技术革新和技术革命运动，专门成立了技术革新委员会领导这项工作，最近半月来，又先后在拉萨汽车修配厂等七个单位召开了现场会议。西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼、中共西藏工委副书记张国华、郭锡兰等都分别参加了现场会议，并且参观了各单位的革新成就。
    各部门的技术革新运动已经取得了很大成绩。某工地学习了内地的先进经验后，已经实现了工地水平运输轨道化、车子化和垂直运输卷扬机化。抹灰工效比过去提高了九倍，砌砖速度也从过去一人一天砌两千块，猛增到一人一天砌一万一千块。在拉萨建筑工程处的木材加工厂里，全厂从原木到断料、刨料、画墨、打眼、落肩等各道工序全部实现了机械化，工人们站在机器旁边，伸手就可从传送带上取来材料，做完所要做的工序后，再经过传送带把半成品送给下一道工序，工效比过去提高了七倍。西藏邮电局职工第二季度以来，完成革新项目二百三十五件，其中85％已在生产中运用。他们用传送带代替人力传送电报，每次传送时间由三分钟缩短到十二秒，还节省了两个人力。他们在收讯台上装上了自动告警台和自动控制器等，有效地消灭了电讯中断的现象。拉萨市一些较大的机关食堂，目前正在推广煤气化和蒸气化，并且在切菜、淘米、和面、磨粉等方面实现了机械化和半机械化。
    交通运输部门的驾驶员们，克服了西藏高原山多、坡陡、路滑等困难，纷纷实行了拖挂运输，提高了运输效率。驾驶员臧英洲还用自己试制成功的拖车，在6月份完成了四万五千三百一十二吨公里运输任务，超过原计划的174％。各车队还普遍做到汽车“二保不过时”和“大修不过日”，并着重解决了汽车的节油问题。
    各部门在技术革新中普遍贯彻了土法上马、土洋结合、以土为主、就地取材的精神，尽量做到不花钱或者少花钱。废铜烂铁、加工剩下的废木头、纸屑、破汽油筒都被利用起来。如西藏邮电局的自动控制器和自动告警器上的部分零件就是用罐头筒和胶卷盒做的。职工们还用报废入库的手摇发电机，改制成了电动机。木材加工厂的职工利用加工后剩下的废木头、刨花和木屑制成了具有隔音和保温作用的木丝板、木屑板和刨花板。拉萨房建队的职工们就地取材，用河沙、黄土、石膏、木屑、石灰等材料试制成功冷砖，这种冷砖不需经过烧制，可用来砌墙和修炉灶，它的承压力和耐水性能并不比烧制的砖差。
