Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: TASS issued a statement on the 16th condemning the recent statement by the US State Department, which invoked the so-called "Monroe Doctrine" in an attempt to regain the "right" to interfere in the affairs of Latin American countries and act arbitrarily in these countries.

The TASS statement emphasized that if armed intervention is taken against Cuba, the Soviet people cannot remain indifferent. Relying on its own strength, the Soviet Union will provide Cuba with the necessary assistance.

The TASS statement pointed out that the people of Latin America, based on their painful experience, deeply understand the true purpose of the predatory colonialist "Monroe Doctrine" that Eisenhower is vigorously promoting today. The era in which US imperialists ride roughshod over the people of Latin American countries and plunder their national wealth at will is coming to an end. The great liberation movement of the Latin American countries is growing stronger and more consolidated, and it has received the warm sympathy and support of friends of freedom and peace around the world.

The statement said that the Soviet people praise the Cuban patriots who heroically hold high the banner of struggle for the country's true national independence. The statement revealed that the US government wants to revive the "Monroe Doctrine" and disguise it as a symbol of "American unity." The US ruling clique, using the slogan of so-called "American unity," is very insidiously and cunningly attempting to conquer Cuba through the puppets it has fostered in certain Latin American countries.

The statement said that the Soviet people absolutely do not believe that Washington's politicians can successfully force other Latin American countries to become accomplices in aggression against the Republic of Cuba. Any country whose government succumbs to the pressure of US imperialists and attempts to add its soldiers to the ranks of the executioners of the Cuban people will disgrace itself. The Soviet people believe that the workers and peasants, intellectuals, and honest patriots of all residents of these countries will not stain their hands with the blood of the Cuban people, nor will they become accomplices in the policy of economically strangling Cuba.

The TASS statement refuted the slander fabricated by the US imperialists that Cuba's independent policy is the result of an international communist conspiracy, and that there is "Soviet interference" in Latin American affairs. The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union has firmly stated that it sympathizes with the Cuban people's goal of liberation and is friendly to the Republic of Cuba. The Soviet Union does not pursue any selfish goals when establishing friendly relations with any country. The Soviet Union does not want to obtain economic privileges, nor does it want to establish any military bases on Cuban territory. However, the Soviet government stated that it will provide the necessary support for the Cuban people's just struggle for national independence, the development of the national economy, and the improvement of the people's material well-being.

The statement concluded by saying that this is no longer an era in which imperialists can treat the people who are striving for national independence rudely. Not only the Soviet Union, but also other peace-loving countries will provide the necessary assistance to Cuba's struggle for freedom and independence.

　　塔斯社发表声明谴责美国政府的声明
　　苏联支持古巴人民的正义斗争
　　美国宣扬“门罗主义”的目的是要侵略古巴
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社在16日发表一篇声明，谴责美国国务院最近发表声明，援引所谓“门罗主义”，企图再次取得干涉拉丁美洲国家事务和在这些国家为所欲为的“权利”的行为。
    塔斯社声明强调说：如果对古巴采取武装干涉，苏联人民不能漠然视之。苏联依靠自己的实力，将给予古巴必要的援助。
    塔斯社在声明中指出，拉丁美洲的人民根据自己痛苦的血的经验深深地懂得今天艾森豪威尔大肆宣扬的、强盗式的殖民主义“门罗主义”的真正目的，美帝国主义者骑在拉丁美洲各国人民头上为所欲为地掠夺他们国家财富的时代将近结束了。拉丁美洲各国人民的伟大解放运动日益壮大和巩固，它得到了全世界自由与和平的朋友们的热烈同情和支持。
    声明表示，苏联人民称赞英勇地高举起争取本国真正的民族独立斗争旗帜的古巴爱国者。声明揭露说，美国政府想复活“门罗主义”，把它冒充为“美洲团结”的象征。美国统治集团利用所谓“美洲团结”的口号，非常阴险狡猾地想通过自己在某些拉丁美洲国家扶植的傀儡来征服古巴。
    声明说，苏联人民绝不相信，华盛顿的政治家能成功地迫使拉丁美洲其他国家成为对古巴共和国进行侵略的同谋者。任何一个国家，如果它的政府屈从美帝国主义者的压力和企图使自己的士兵加入古巴人民的刽子手的行列，都将使自己蒙上耻辱。苏联人民相信，这些国家的工人和农民、知识分子和各居民阶层的诚实的爱国者不会使自己的手染上古巴人民的血，也不会使自己成为从经济上扼杀古巴这种政策的同谋者。
    塔斯社声明驳斥了美帝国主义者捏造什么古巴的独立政策是国际共产主义阴谋的结果，以及什么“苏联干涉”拉丁美洲的事务的谰言。声明指出，苏联曾坚决声明，它同情古巴人民解放的目的，并对古巴共和国友好。苏联同任何一个国家建立友好关系时都不追求任何自私的目的。苏联既不想取得经济特权，也不想在古巴领土上建立什么军事基地。但是，苏联政府声明，它将对古巴人民争取民族独立、发展民族经济以及提高人民物质福利的正义斗争给予必要的支持。
    声明最后说，现在已经不是帝国主义者能够无礼对待争取民族独立的人民的时代了。不仅苏联，而且其他爱好和平的国家也将对古巴争取自由和独立的斗争给予必要的援助。
