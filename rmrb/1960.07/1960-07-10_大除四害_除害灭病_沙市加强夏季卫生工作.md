Eliminate the Four Pests, Eliminate Pests and Eradicate Diseases
    Shashi Strengthens Summer Hygiene Work

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the beginning of summer, Shashi, Hubei, has been engaged in a large-scale patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and eradicate diseases, pushing the city's hygiene work to a higher standard. At present, all communes in the city are actively mobilizing the masses to dredge and fill small and medium-sized sewage ditches, ponds, and stagnant water pits near residential areas, and to clean up indoor and outdoor water storage containers.

    During the hygiene blitz, the people of the city turned out en masse, sweeping away the remaining enemies of mosquitoes and flies, achieving brilliant results. Recently, the city has been conducting smoke fumigation and large-scale disinfection in a unified time and unified action for several days. Every day at the specified time, smoke fumigation is carried out everywhere, and the supervision teams also check house to house. If they find any gaps, they immediately make up for the lesson. For the few residents who do not have enough fumigation medicine, they also promptly deliver the medicine to their hands. Farmers in the suburbs also use the gaps in production to carry out mosquito eradication on a large scale. Squad 1 of the Sanbanqiao Brigade and Squad 3 of the Heping Brigade have all carried out indoor smoke fumigation relatively widely. At the same time, residents of the city used all methods of eliminating bedbugs, such as sun exposure, boiling water scalding, and drug poisoning, to eliminate the remaining bedbugs.

    In this blitz, great achievements have also been made in disease prevention and control. The first preventive injection against typhoid fever in the city has now been basically completed; canteens and the catering industry have further strengthened the inspection and appraisal of food, added sanitary storage facilities, and many canteens have regularly adhered to the disease prevention system; street sanitary tea stations have been universally established, replacing the original cool tea vendors. In this way, the occurrence and spread of summer and autumn infectious diseases have been effectively controlled.

    大除四害　除害灭病
    沙市加强夏季卫生工作
    本报讯　湖北沙市入夏以来，大搞除害灭病讲卫生运动，使全市卫生工作向着更高的标准前进。目前，全市各公社积极发动群众，对居住区附近的中小型污水沟塘和积水坑洼进行了疏挖和填除，并清理了室内外积水坛罐。
    卫生突击运动中，全市人民倾城出动，横扫蚊、蝇残敌，取得了辉煌战果。近来，全市统一时间、统一行动，连日进行了火烟熏、大消毒。每天一到规定时间，到处都进行烟熏，督战队还挨家挨户进行检查，发现空白点，马上补课，对少数烟熏药准备不足的居民户，也及时送药到手。郊区农民也利用生产间隙，大搞灭蚊，三板桥大队一小队、和平大队三小队等都比较普遍地进行了室内烟熏。同时，全市居民利用一切灭臭虫方法，如烈日晒、开水烫、药物毒杀等，消灭了残余的臭虫。
    在这次突击运动中，防病灭病也取得了很大成绩。全市伤寒病的第一次预防注射现在已经基本完成；食堂和饮食业进一步加强了对食品的检查鉴定，增添了卫生贮藏的设施，很多食堂都经常坚持了防病制度；街道卫生茶水站已经普遍设立起来，代替了原来凉茶摊贩。这样一来，就有效地控制了夏秋传染病的发生和流行。
