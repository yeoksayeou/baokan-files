Xindeng Commune Promotes Phonetic Literacy and Putonghua

(Our dispatch) Since the Xindeng People's Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, comprehensively promoted phonetic literacy and the learning of Putonghua in March, it has shown great advantages in comprehensively consolidating and expanding the achievements of literacy campaigns and accelerating the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses.

After Tonglu County issued the call for "Everyone to learn to speak Putonghua, to accelerate the intellectualization of workers and peasants" in February this year, the Xindeng Commune immediately responded. Within three days, 126 cadre and farmer spare-time schools in the commune's production brigades had universally taken action. Aiming at the problem of insufficient teachers in the movement to promote phonetic literacy and Putonghua, they grasped the method of spare-time training of civilian teachers, gave full play to the role of primary and secondary school teachers, and trained teachers through various forms such as short-term training classes for civilian teachers in the commune and worker-peasant spare-time normal schools in the brigades, with teachers leading apprentices, dividing labor and contracting responsibilities. In terms of teaching methods, they changed the past practice of separating the promotion of Putonghua and literacy, and adopted a teaching method that combines the use of phonetic alphabet as a tool to help recognize Chinese characters and learn Putonghua, and often used local dialects and Putonghua for comparative explanations. When teaching the alphabet, they first taught syllables close to the dialect, and adopted the teaching principle of more comparison, more practice, from easy to difficult, and dispersing difficulties. By learning Chinese characters through phonetic alphabet, the scope of literacy was expanded. At the same time, the pronunciation of Chinese characters appearing in pinyin was used to learn Putonghua. After ten days of intensive study, more than 3,200 young and middle-aged commune members in the commune have basically mastered the pronunciation and spelling of the phonetic alphabet, thereby rapidly improving their ability to read newspapers and periodicals. For example, in the Quanmei Mess Hall of Liuzhu Brigade, the 45 young and middle-aged students in the spare-time school originally knew an average of only 1,300 characters. After eight days of phonetic literacy learning, the average number of characters they knew has increased to more than 2,200. Female commune member Ni Chunhua originally knew more than 1,400 characters, but later gradually regressed and dropped to 842 characters. This time, after participating in phonetic literacy learning, the number of characters she recognized quickly rose to more than 2,400.

After the commune members broke through the literacy barrier, the intellectualization of workers and peasants was accelerated. They read books and newspapers eagerly, wrote poems and articles. According to estimates in late April, commune members read about 40,000 copies of the commune's self-edited phonetic reading materials and phonetic reading materials sold in bookstores; in April, students in the commune's spare-time schools wrote more than 42,000 poems. They sang praises saying: "Square Chinese characters are really difficult, learning pinyin breaks through the barrier, Chairman Mao brought the omnipotent treasure, the heavy pen listens to orders." After mastering the tool of phonetic alphabet, commune members can use the pinyin dictionary to read books and newspapers "without a teacher." For example, after the students of the Weixing Mess Hall spare-time school in Chengyang Town dispersed for spring busy season, 45 commune members still insisted on reading books and newspapers every day. Fang Chuanlai, a student at this school, was illiterate before liberation. After studying for several years after liberation, he still only knew more than 400 characters. Now, after learning pinyin, the number of characters he knows has increased to more than 1,500 in just one month. Now, the commune has also organized 530 study groups for studying Chairman Mao's works. Through the study of documents such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "On Contradiction," the ideological awareness of the commune members has been greatly improved, which has played a positive role in promoting the current technological revolution movement.

### 巩固扩大扫盲成果　加速工农知识化  新登公社推广注音识字普通话

    巩固扩大扫盲成果　加速工农知识化
    新登公社推广注音识字普通话
    本报讯　浙江省桐庐县新登人民公社从3月份全面推广注音识字和学习普通话以来，对全面巩固和扩大扫盲成果，加速工农群众知识化已显示了很大的优越性。
    今年2月，桐庐县发出了“全民学讲普通话，加速工农知识化”的号召后，新登公社立即响应，在三天中，公社各生产大队一百二十六所干部和农民业余学校已普遍地行动起来。他们针对注音识字学讲普通话运动中师资不足的问题，抓住民师业余培训的方法，充分发挥中小学教师的作用，以师带徒分工包干，并通过公社民师短期训练班、大队工农业余师范等多种形式突击培训了师资。在教学方法上，改变了过去推广普通话和识字分家的做法，采用了利用拼音字母作工具，帮助认识汉字和学习普通话三结合的教学方法，并经常运用土话和普通话对比说明。教字母时，先教与方言相近音节，采取了多比较、多练习，由易到难，分散难点的教学原则。通过拼音字母学习了汉字，扩大了识字范围，同时通过拼音所出现的汉字读音又学会了普通话。经过十天集中学习，全社三千二百多个青壮年社员已经基本上掌握了拼音字母的发音、拼音，从而迅速提高了他们阅读书报的能力。例如，六渚大队全美食堂，业余学校的四十五个青壮年学员，原来平均每人只识一千三百个字，经过注音识字八天时间的学习，每人识字量平均已增加到二千二百多个。女社员倪春花，原来已识字一千四百多个，后来逐渐回生下降到识字八百四十二个，这次参加了注音识字学习，认字量很快上升到二千四百多个。
    社员在突破了识字关后，加速了工农知识化。他们如饥如渴地读书、读报，写诗写文，据4月下旬估计，社员读了公社自编的注音读物和书店销售的注音读物共达四万册左右；在4月份，全社业余学校的学员们共写诗四万二千多首。他们歌颂说：“方块汉字实在难，学了拼音就破关，毛主席带来万能宝，千斤笔听使唤”。社员在掌握了拼音字母这一工具后，利用拼音字典已可以“无师自通”地阅读书报。例如，城阳镇卫星食堂业余学校学员，在春忙分散学习后，四十五个社员仍旧坚持天天读书看报。这个学校的学员方传来，解放前是个文盲，解放后学了好几年，还只识字四百多个，现在学了拼音后，仅一个月识字量就增至一千五百多个。现在，公社还组织了五百三十个阅读毛主席著作的学习小组，通过《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《矛盾论》等文献学习，大大提高了社员的思想觉悟，对推动当前技术革命运动起了积极的作用。
