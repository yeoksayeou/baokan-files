Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Leopoldville: The Congolese military and civilians are resolutely defending their national independence and fighting back against the Belgian invading forces. In Matadi Port in Lower Congo, the brave Congolese soldiers, after fierce fighting, repelled the large number of Belgian paratroopers and continue to defend this largest seaport in Congo.

In the capital, Leopoldville, the Congolese people's fighting spirit continues to rise. On July 15th, approximately three hundred angry African residents fought back against the provocations of some Belgian colonists with stones. There are reports that in the jungle area near the city, the Congolese people are fighting the Belgian colonists. The Belgian army has dispatched aircraft to circle at low altitude in the jungle, attempting to intimidate the Congolese people. It is reported that in Coquilhatville, the capital of Equateur Province in northern Congo, the Congolese people have also launched a patriotic struggle to defend their independence, and armed Congolese people once controlled the airport there. The panicked Belgian authorities hastily airlifted fifty paratroopers there on July 15th to strengthen the suppression.

On the same day, the Congolese national radio broadcast a statement from the Congolese government saying, "The situation is dangerous, but with the support of our friends, we will continue the battle for the independence of our country."

The statement condemned Belgium's aggression against Congo and said: "There is no independent Katanga, only an independent Congo, and we will defend its independence."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, in a speech to the Congolese Parliament on July 15th, condemned the United States for supporting Belgium's aggressive actions in the United Nations. He pointed out that the United States wanted Belgium to continue to maintain its military bases in Congo.

Lumumba said that he would demand the withdrawal of UN forces if these forces came "in the spirit expressed by the United Nations of supporting the Belgians." He added, "Only when they are here for the benefit of Congo, and not for the benefit of Belgium," can they remain in Congo.

In his speech, Lumumba announced that the Republic of the Congo was in a state of war. He ordered the Belgian army to withdraw from Congo within twelve hours and asked the parliament to order the closure of the Belgian embassy.

He said that it was necessary to sever diplomatic relations with Belgium, "Belgian diplomatic personnel must leave, and the Belgians must withdraw from the military bases they currently occupy." He went on to say, "Only then, and only then, can we consider new relations with Belgium in the future." On the same evening, Lumumba also delivered a radio address to the nation, exposing the Belgian colonists' plot to split Congo's territory. He accused the Belgian colonists of instigating their agents in Congo to engage in separatist activities in the rich Katanga province. He said that this proved that Belgium still believed that Congo should be exploited by them. He pointed out that although the Belgian authorities were forced to agree to Congo's independence, it was not sincere. He said the Belgian plot would be shattered.

It is reported that on the same evening, the Congolese government handed a note to the Belgian Ambassador to Congo, Van der Meersch, notifying him that Congo officially severed diplomatic relations with Belgium starting on the 14th. The note said that Belgian troops must withdraw from Congolese cities such as Leopoldville, Luluabourg, Elisabethville, and the Lower Congo region on the same night, and withdraw from the Kamina and Kitona military bases within twelve hours.

It is reported that the Congolese Parliament has unanimously passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Belgian troops from Congo. (Attached picture)

　　刚果人民英勇奋战保卫祖国
　　马塔迪港守军击退入侵比军
　　卢蒙巴宣布同比利时绝交并谴责美国支持侵略者
    新华社16日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民坚决保卫祖国独立，反击比利时侵略军的斗争仍在各地进行。在下刚果马塔迪港，英勇的刚果士兵经过激战击退来犯的大批比利时伞兵之后，继续守卫着这个刚果最大的海港。
    在首都利奥波德维尔，刚果人民的斗争情绪继续高涨。15日，约三百名愤怒的非洲居民用石块奋起反击一些比利时殖民者的挑衅。有消息说，在这个城市附近的丛林地带，刚果人民正在同比利时殖民者进行战斗。比利时军队曾派遣飞机在丛林低空盘旋，企图恫吓刚果人民。据报道，在刚果北部赤道省首府科基尔哈特维尔，刚果人民也掀起了保卫独立的爱国斗争，刚果人民的武装曾经控制了那里的机场。惊惶失措的比利时当局15日赶忙向那里空运五十名伞兵加强镇压。
    当天，刚果国家电台广播一项刚果政府的声明说，“局势是危险的，但是在我们的朋友们的支持下，我们将继续为争取我们国家独立而进行的战斗”。
    声明谴责比利时侵略刚果，并且说：“不存在独立的加丹加，只有一个独立的刚果，我们将保卫它的独立。”
    新华社16日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴15日在刚果议会发表演说时谴责了美国在联合国中支持比利时的侵略行动。他指出，美国希望比利时继续保持它在刚果的军事基地。
    卢蒙巴说，他将要求联合国部队撤走，如果这些部队是“本着联合国所表示的支持比利时人的精神”前来的话。他又说，“只有他们在这里是为了刚果的利益，而不是为了比利时的利益时”，他们才能够留在刚果。
    卢蒙巴在讲话中宣布，刚果共和国处于战争状态。他限令比利时军队在十二小时内撤出刚果，并要求议会下令封闭比利时大使馆。
    他说，同比利时断绝外交关系是必要的，“比利时的外交人员必须离开，比利时人必须撤出他们在目前所占领的军事基地”。他接着说，“随后，也只有在随后，我们才可能在未来考虑同比利时的新关系。”同一天晚上，卢蒙巴还向全国人民发表广播演说，揭露比利时殖民者分裂刚果领土的阴谋。他指责比利时殖民者唆使他们在刚果的代理人在富饶的加丹加省搞分裂活动。他说，这证明，比利时始终认为刚果仍旧应该被他们剥削。他指出，虽然比利时当局被迫同意刚果独立，但是这是不真诚的。他说，比利时人的阴谋将被粉碎。
    据报道，当天晚上，刚果政府将一份照会交给比利时驻刚果大使范德梅什，通知他刚果于14日起正式同比利时断绝外交关系。照会说，比利时军队必须在当晚从刚果的利奥波德维尔、路路阿堡、伊利沙伯维尔等刚果城市以及下刚果地区撤走，十二小时内从加米纳和基托纳军事基地撤走。
    消息说，刚果议会已一致通过要求比利时军队撤出刚果的决定。（附图片）
