　　Improve the Quality of Steel and Machinery, First Improve the Quality of Pig Iron
　　Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, and Xinjiang Vigorously Grasp High Quality and High Yield in Small Blast Furnaces
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th—The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a call to the province's iron smelting front, demanding the firm implementation of seven effective measures to ensure a continued and substantial improvement in pig iron quality, and to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in quality, high yield, and low consumption in small blast furnaces.
　　These seven measures were formulated by the Provincial Department of Metallurgy to better implement the principle of "using iron to guarantee steel." Their main contents are: immediately launch a great debate among all employees to examine the reasons for good or bad pig iron quality, further clarify the idea of using good iron to guarantee steel, and use the method of vigorous mass movements to summarize experience, find solutions, and conquer high sulfur; resolutely implement the principle of "refined materials," reduce the sulfur content of raw materials entering the furnace, and let the blast furnace eat "fine and mature materials"; increase the basicity of the slag, promote the experience of limestone ironmaking, and achieve full utilization of the effective volume of the blast furnace; increase air volume, raise blast temperature, and strengthen smelting intensity, strengthen external desulfurization, and put all past effective experiences into use; strengthen the pig iron quality management system, clarify the quality responsibility system, require each iron plant to establish and improve testing institutions, achieve furnace-by-furnace testing and graded storage of pig iron, pig iron with sulfur content not meeting the standards will not be counted in production, and pig iron with sulfur content exceeding 0.35% is not allowed to leave the factory.
　　In order to ensure that each of the seven measures is implemented and takes effect quickly, the Hebei Provincial Department of Metallurgy has recently transferred a group of cadres to form four working groups, led by bureau and section chiefs, to go to key iron-producing areas such as Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan to assist in improving pig iron quality.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th—The quality of iron from small blast furnaces in various parts of Shanxi Province is steadily improving. The qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces in the province in June has increased from 86.64% in May to 87.57%, an increase of 4.64% compared with the beginning of this year. According to incomplete statistics, the pig iron qualification rate of more than 40 small iron smelting enterprises has reached more than 90%; among them, the iron plants in Yuxian, Pinging, and Jincheng counties, and the Datong Wangjiayuan Iron Plant, have maintained a 100% qualification rate for several consecutive months, becoming red flags for high quality and high yield in small blast furnaces throughout the province.
　　Leading cadres going deep into the front line and earnestly grasping measures is the fundamental guarantee for promoting rapid and substantial improvement in pig iron quality. Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of Party organizations, the workers of various iron smelting plants in the province have gradually carried out technological transformations of small blast furnaces, creating favorable conditions for improving pig iron quality. At the same time, in the competition movement, they have also specifically set quality indicators as one of the main conditions for competition evaluation, and have formulated a system that unqualified pig iron will not be put into storage or leave the factory, strengthening raw material management and testing work. The two factory directors and six section chiefs of the Datong Wangjiayuan Iron Plant have been leading a group of cadres to work in the workshop and in front of the furnace since the beginning of this year, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the workers, and have formed a production leading group with the workshop leaders to specifically divide the work to grasp raw materials, machinery repair, and smelting. Because the various measures are practical and specific, the qualification rate of pig iron in the entire factory has remained at 100% for six consecutive months, and the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has remained above 1.4 tons since February. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Yuxian Iron Plant transferred more than 50 cadres directly to the workshops and mining areas to work while laboring, ensuring that the production plan was overfulfilled month by month and the quality was improved step by step.
　　The continuous improvement of the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces has greatly reduced the cost of pig iron. After the technical transformation of the small blast furnace in Yangquan Yinying Iron Plant, the qualification rate of iron increased from 70% to 100%, and the cost also decreased from more than 243 yuan per ton to 194 yuan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th—Various parts of Anhui Province are carrying out comprehensive technological transformations of the "small foreign groups" of iron smelting, further improving the production level of small blast furnaces. By the end of June, the small blast furnaces that have been transformed and are being transformed in various places accounted for half of the total number of existing fully equipped small blast furnaces in the province. The technical transformations of these small blast furnaces include more than ten aspects such as air supply, gas, charging, cooling, crushing, and material transportation; some small blast furnaces have also carried out partial transformations, mainly focusing on the air supply system, and have successfully implemented large-scale air operation. The output of the small blast furnaces that have been transformed has generally increased, the average monthly utilization coefficient is above two, and the quality of pig iron has also been greatly improved.
　　When the Party committees in various places grasped the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, they attached great importance to the new problems that emerged after the equipment transformation, such as the inability to immediately adapt to the operating technology and the failure to supply ore and coke. In order to solve the problem that blast furnace operators were not accustomed to large-scale air operation and high-load operation, the Party committees of various factories promptly summarized and promoted new operating experiences. After the transformation, the output of small blast furnaces increased greatly, and the demand for ore and coke also increased greatly, which easily caused a supply-demand imbalance. Therefore, in addition to vigorously grasping the technical transformation of mines and strengthening the allocation and transportation of ore and coke, the Party committees in various places also paid attention to the improvement of raw material management work. The factories in Hefei generally adopted methods such as separating, selecting, inspecting, testing, sintering, and roasting ores to make the best use of ores without wasting anything.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 14th—The workers of the "small foreign group" enterprises on the iron and steel front in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with the comprehensive improvement of the production level of small blast furnaces as the center, are launching a "two-nine-nine-three" red flag competition movement.
　　The "two-nine-nine-three" movement is being carried out under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. The content is to achieve a utilization coefficient of two for small blast furnaces, a pig iron qualification rate of 90%, a coke ratio of less than 0.9, and a cost of less than 300 yuan per ton of pig iron through competition.
　　In order to ensure the realization of the above competition indicators, after the movement was launched, each iron smelting plant concentrated its efforts on the comprehensive technical transformation of small blast furnaces. So far, the technical transformation of the furnace body system and hot blast stove of the first batch of small blast furnaces in the region has been largely completed, and the production level of small blast furnaces has been rapidly improved.
　　In order to promote the "two-nine-nine-three" competition movement more comprehensively and deeply, the Autonomous Region Party Committee and leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line of production to inspect production and direct production. They discovered major key issues on the front line of production, grasped one and broke through one, promoted one, and combined collaboration, learning experience, and sending treasures, and improved ideology, technology, and management.

　　提高钢材和机械质量　首先要提高生铁质量
　　河北山西安徽新疆狠抓小高炉优质高产
    新社华天津14日电　中共河北省委最近向全省炼铁战线职工发出号召，要求狠抓七项有效措施，保证继续大幅度提高生铁质量，实现小高炉优质、高产和低耗全面跃进。
    这七项措施是省冶金厅为更好地贯彻以铁保钢的原则而制定的。它们的主要内容是：立即在全体职工中开展一次鸣放辩论，检查生铁质量好或坏的原因，进一步明确以好铁保钢的思想，并且以大搞群众运动的方法总结经验，想办法、找措施，降伏高硫；坚决贯彻“精料”方针，减少入炉原料含硫量，让高炉吃“细料熟料”；提高炉渣碱度，推行石灰炼铁经验，达到充分利用高炉有效容积；加大风量、提高风温和冶炼强度，加强炉外脱硫，把过去一切行之有效的经验都使用起来；加强生铁质量管理制度，明确质量责任制，要求各铁厂建立和健全化验机构，做到生铁炉炉化验、分级存放，生铁含硫量不合标准一律不计算产量，含硫量超过0.35％的生铁不准出厂。
    为了使七项措施条条落实，迅速见效，河北省冶金厅最近已抽调一批干部组成四个工作组，由局、处长带领，分赴邯郸、石家庄、唐山等重点产铁区，协助当地提高生铁质量。
    新华社太原14日电　山西省各地小高炉铁质量步步提高。全省6月份小高炉生铁的合格率，已由5月份的86.64％提高到87.57％，比今年年初提高了4.64％。据不完全的统计，现在已有四十多个小型炼铁企业的生铁合格率，都达到了90％以上；其中盂县、平定、晋城等县的铁厂和大同王家园铁厂，都连续几个月保持了100％的合格率，成为全省小高炉优质高产的旗红。
    领导干部深入第一线，切切实实抓措施，是促进生铁质量迅速大幅度提高的根本保证。今年以来，全省各炼铁厂职工在党组织的领导下，对小高炉逐步地进行了技术改造，为提高生铁质量创造了有利条件。同时，在竞赛运动中，还特别把质量指标定为竞赛评比的主要条件之一，并且制定了生铁不合格不入库、不出厂的制度，加强了原料管理和化验工作。大同王家园铁厂的两个厂长、六个科长，今年以来一直带领一部分干部在车间和炉前办公，跟工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，并且同车间领导干部组成了生产领导小组，具体分工抓原料、机修和冶炼。由于各项措施切实具体，全厂生铁合格率连续六个月保持了100％，高炉利用系数从2月到现在一直保持在一点四吨以上。盂县铁厂在党委领导下抽调出五十多个干部直接到车间、矿区边劳动边工作，保证了生产计划月月超额，质量步步提高。
    小高炉生铁质量的不断提高，大幅度地降低了生铁的成本。阳泉荫营铁厂小高炉经过技术改造以后，铁的合格率由70％提高到100％，成本也随之由每吨二百四十三元多降低到一百九十四元。
    据新华社合肥14日电　安徽省各地对炼铁“小洋群”全面进行技术改造，进一步提高了小高炉的生产水平。到6月底，各地已经改造的和正在进行改造的小高炉，占全省现有配全套的小高炉总数的一半。这些小高炉的技术改造，包括送风、煤气、上料、冷却、破碎和运料等十多个方面；也有一些小高炉以送风系统为主，进行了局部改造，都成功地实行了大风操作。已经改造好的小高炉，产量都普遍上升，月平均利用系数都在二以上，生铁质量也有了很大提高。
    各地党委在抓小高炉的技术改造时，十分重视设备改造后出现的操作技术不能立即适应，矿石、焦炭供应不上的新问题。为了解决高炉操作人员不习惯大风操作和高负荷操作的问题，各厂党委都及时总结推广了新的操作经验。改造后的小高炉，产量大增，对矿石、焦炭的需要量也大大增加，容易造成供求脱节现象。因此，各地党委除了大抓矿山的技术改造、加强矿石、焦炭的调运工作以外，还注意了原料管理工作的改进。合肥各厂普遍采取对矿石的分、选、检查、化验、烧结和焙烧矿石等办法，使矿石各有所用，一点不浪费。
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　新疆维吾尔自治区钢铁战线“小洋群”企业的职工，以全面提高小高炉生产水平为中心，正在开展一个“二九九三”红旗竞赛运动。
      “二九九三”运动是在自治区党委的直接领导下开展的。内容是，通过竞赛使小高炉利用系数达到二，生铁合格率达到90％，焦比下降到零点九以下，生铁每吨成本降到三百元以下。
    为保证实现以上的竞赛指标，运动展开以后，各炼铁厂都集中力量对小高炉进行了全面的技术改造。到目前为止，全区第一批小高炉的炉体系统和热风炉的技术改造工作已大部结束，小高炉的生产水平迅速提高。
    为了促进“二九九三”竞赛运动更全面深入展开，自治区党委和各级领导干部，都纷纷深入生产第一线检查生产，指挥生产。他们在生产第一线发现重大关键性问题，抓住一条就突破一条、推广一条，使协作、取经、送宝三结合，思想、技术、管理三提高。（附图片）
