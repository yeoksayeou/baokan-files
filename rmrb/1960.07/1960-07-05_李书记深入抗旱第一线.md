    Secretary Li Goes Deep into the Forefront of Drought Resistance
    On June 18th, just after the conclusion of the county committee's four-level expanded cadre meeting, Li Changtai, the first secretary of our commune party committee, immediately packed his bags that evening and led the commune's cadres to the areas with heavy drought resistance, emergency planting, and seedling protection tasks – the Wuzhuang Production Brigade.

    Secretary Li's participation in production and leadership of production at the forefront of drought resistance greatly inspired the commune members' enthusiasm for the struggle against drought. The cadres of the commune, production brigade, and production team all went deep into the forefront of drought resistance, eating, living, and laboring alongside the masses, jointly studying methods to overcome the drought, and promoting the drought resistance movement throughout the commune. Before June 20th, the commune was irrigating more than 3,100 mu of land per day; now, it has increased to irrigating more than 6,400 mu of land per day.

    李书记深入抗旱第一线
    6月18日，县委召开的四级扩干会议刚刚结束，我们公社党委第一书记李长太当晚就整理了行装，带领着公社的干部，搬到抗旱抢种保苗任务繁重的地方——五庄生产大队。
    李书记到抗旱第一线参加生产、领导生产，大大地鼓舞了社员抗旱斗争的积极性。公社、生产大队、生产小队的干部，都深入到抗旱最前线，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、共同研究战胜干旱的办法，推动了全社抗旱运动。6月20日以前全社日浇地三千一百多亩，现在增加到日浇地六千四百多亩。
