Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd -- The following is the full text of the speech given by Theodore Bengila, member of the National Steering Committee and Second Deputy Secretary-General of the Congolese African Solidarity Party, at the "People of the Capital Supporting the Congolese People's Opposition to Imperialist Aggression and Interference, and Defending National Independence Conference":

    Dear Comrades:

    Just a few days ago, I told you at a conference that the independence of the Congo was only the first step in the real struggle that began after June 30th.

    My prediction was not just empty words, because on the eighth day after our country declared independence, what was expected to happen had become a reality.

    In fact, the imperialist bloc was not reconciled to their defeat, nor to our victory. They quickly plotted another conspiracy: to use armed forces to stifle the just movement of our people to achieve genuine independence, which our people have long demanded.

    The Congolese people are more determined than ever to make their government have a truly independent character in the eyes of the world. The Congolese people will never tolerate the sharing of power between their elected representatives and the Belgian government, no matter how unhappy the Belgian government may be.

    Because the Belgian government is unwilling to accept this, and because it is supported in this regard by the entire imperialist bloc, the Belgian government believes it has a responsibility to use troops against the Congo. Now the intent of little Belgium is obvious, namely to continue to treat the Congo as a docile child, with everything taken care of by it.

    The nature of imperialism is the same everywhere. They want to live parasitically forever alongside those who have been harmed by them in the past, through various degrees of disguised forms. To achieve this goal, they have exhausted all means, from armed repression to the division of the Congo. This chronic disease and short-sightedness still haunt little Belgium, which barely ranks among the great powers and is in fact insignificant in the world!

    The Belgian government, unable to achieve its goals through the use of weapons, has frantically attempted to separate Katanga Province from the rest of the Congo.

    However, the Belgian government and the Katanga provincial government completely disregard the fact that we are in the twentieth century. The conspiracies of the Belgian government in 1960 and the betrayal of the Katanga provincial government can never stop the wheels of history from advancing, especially in 1960, which we can call the "Year of Oppressed Nations." In our view, the era when countries that call themselves free exploit underdeveloped countries is over.

    Therefore, now is the time for the Belgian government, especially the Catholic Social Party, to consider this obvious truth. Under no circumstances should the Belgian Catholic Social Party unilaterally and ultimately destroy the relations that may still exist between the two countries.

    The presence of Belgian troops on Congolese soil is not only unreasonable, but also further proves the political incompetence of the Belgian government.

    As for the issue of the United Nations sending troops to the Congo, I believe that the actions of the United Nations troops are meaningless as long as the Belgian troops do not get out of the Congo.

    Cooperation between Belgian troops and United Nations troops does more harm than good to the Congo.

    The Congolese government must be vigilant and appeal to those it deems appropriate in order to safeguard our country's territorial integrity; writing letters to United Nations leaders is just a waste of time.

    The intentions and statements of the United Nations leaders are clear: to support Belgium's stupid behavior and allow Belgium, which cannot survive without the Congo's natural resources, to reoccupy the Congo.

    The United Nations troops are not unaware that eternal friendship cannot be bought with artillery fire, but is a natural feeling based on the equality of the countries concerned.

    Based on the above, I can draw the following conclusion, that the current struggle of the Congolese people has three aspects:

    First, to fight against the Belgian aggressors;

    Second, to fight against all imperialists who have interests in the Congo and support Belgium's barbarous behavior;

    Third, to deal with those national traitors who, through their actions, help foreigners to divide the Congo.

    Therefore, the struggle appears to be arduous, but given the firm will and joint efforts of the entire Congolese people, they will be able to achieve final victory.

    Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my special thanks to the Chinese people, who, whether in the countryside or in the big cities, support the just and reasonable struggle of the Congolese people. At the same time, I would also like to express my thanks to all friendly countries for making every effort to restore peace to the world, especially to the Congo.

### 刚果人民必将取得最后胜利  刚果非洲团结党第二副总书记西奥多·本基拉的讲话

    刚果人民必将取得最后胜利
    刚果非洲团结党第二副总书记西奥多·本基拉的讲话
    新华社23日讯　刚果非洲团结党全国指导委员会委员、第二副总书记西奥多·本基拉在“首都各界人民支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立大会”上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    仅仅在几天以前，我曾经在一次大会上对你们说过，刚果的独立只不过是6月30日以后才开始的真正斗争的第一步。
    我的预言并不是一句空话，因为就在我国宣布独立以后的第八天，预料要发生的事已经变成了现实。
    事实上，帝国主义集团不甘心于他们的失败，也不甘心于我们的胜利，他们很快就策划了另一个阴谋：用武装力量扼杀我国人民争取实现真正独立的正义运动，而这种真正的独立是我国人民长期以来所要求的。
    刚果人民比过去任何时候更有决心使他们的政府在全世界面前具有真正独立的特性。刚果人民决不会容忍由他们选出的代表和比利时政府分享政权，尽管比利时政府会感到不高兴。
    由于比利时政府不愿意这样的接受这一点，由于它在这方面受到整个帝国主义集团的支持，比利时政府认为有责任使用军队来对付刚果。现在小小的比利时的企图是明显的，即继续把刚果当作一个驯服的孩子看待，什么事都要由它来包办。
    帝国主义的本性到处都是一样的，它们想通过不同程度的伪装的形式永远地在那些过去受到他们危害的人们的身边过寄生生活。为了达到这个目的，他们用尽了所有一切的手段，从武装镇压一直到分裂刚果。这种慢性病和短见性仍然缭绕着勉强置身于大国之列而事实上在世界范围内却无足轻重的，小小的比利时！
    比利时政府，由于运用武器还不能达到它的目的，便疯狂地企图把加丹加省从刚果其他部分分裂出去。
    但是，比利时政府和加丹加省政府却完全无视我们是处在二十世纪中。1960年比利时政府的阴谋活动和加丹加省政府的背叛行为都绝不能阻止历史车轮前进，尤其是在我们可以称之为“被压迫民族年”的1960年。在我们看来，自称为自由的国家来剥削不发达国家的时代已经过去了。
    因此，现在正是比利时政府，特别是天主教社会党考虑这个很明显的真理的时候了。在任何情况下，比利时天主教社会党都不应当单独地和最终地破坏两国之间可能还存在着的关系。
    比利时军队呆在刚果土地上，不仅仅是没有道理的，而且还再一次证明比利时政府政治上的无能。
    至于联合国派遣军队到刚果去的问题，我认为只要比利时军队不从刚果滚出去，联合国军队的行动就是没有意义的。
    比利时军队和联合国军队的合作给刚果带来的坏处多，好处少。
    刚果政府必须保持警惕并向它认为合适的人发出呼吁，以便维护我国的领土完整；写信给联合国领导人只不过是白白地浪费时间。
    联合国领导人的意图和声明是明确的，即支持比利时的愚蠢的行为，使没有刚果的自然富源就无法生存的比利时重新占领刚果。
    联合国军队不是不知道，永恒的友谊是不能用炮火来换取的，而是一种建立在有关国家平等基础上的自然的感情。
    根据以上所述，我可以得出这样的结论，即目前刚果人民的斗争有三个方面：
    第一、对比利时侵略者进行斗争；
    第二、对在刚果拥有利益并且支持比利时的野蛮行为的一切帝国主义者进行斗争；
    第三、对付那些用他们的行动帮助外国人分裂刚果的民族叛徒。
    因此，从现象上看来斗争是艰巨的，但是，鉴于刚果全体人民的坚定意志和共同努力，他们将能够取得最后的胜利。
    最后，我借此机会特别向中国人民表示谢意，中国人民无论是在农村里，还是在大城市里，都支持刚果人民的正义的、合理的斗争。同时我也向一切友好国家表示谢意，感谢他们作出一切努力为了使全世界，特别是刚果，恢复和平。
