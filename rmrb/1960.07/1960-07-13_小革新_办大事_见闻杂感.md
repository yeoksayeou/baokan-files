　　Small Innovation Accomplishes Great Things
　　——Miscellaneous Thoughts and Observations

    Naxi County in Sichuan Province rapidly achieved the floatation of wooden boat transportation in May. The monthly output per ton of boats has leapt to the championship of large-scale high-yield wooden boats in the province, and the banner of high yield is being raised higher and higher.

    Naxi County is located in the southern part of Sichuan Province, at the confluence of the Yongning River and the Yangtze River. 90% of the county's materials are transported by these two rivers. In order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development, in addition to promoting advanced experiences such as sails, capstans, and night navigation, they also modified many boats into streamlined fish-belly boats to reduce resistance, greatly increasing the carrying capacity of the boats. However, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of continuous revolution, the shipping workers of this county were not satisfied with their achievements. They advanced victoriously, doing everything possible to tap the potential of wooden boats. Sure enough, nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. One day, Wang Shaocheng, a boatman with twenty years of experience, was repairing a boat at the construction site when he saw several gasoline drums floating down the Yangtze River. The oil drums had a shallow draft and floated high on the water. He thought to himself, wouldn't it increase the buoyancy of the boat and increase its carrying capacity if we made some similar wooden barrels and hung them on both sides of the boat? So he made a model overnight and tested it. When he loaded stones, it carried twice as much as usual. That night, he excitedly told the company leaders about this discovery. The Party promptly provided strong support for this emerging new thing, supported and encouraged him, and organized veteran workers to study it together. After two days of hard work, they finally produced the first wooden pontoon boat, which greatly increased the carrying capacity. But Wang Shaocheng was not satisfied. He also came up with a way to use nan bamboo to make pontoons, overcoming the difficulty of the lack of wood. He bundled a row of nan bamboo on both sides of an eight-ton fish-belly boat, which increased the boat's carrying capacity by 50% to 70%. The boat's carrying capacity was thus rising step by step, higher and higher.

    As soon as the pontoon boat was born, it immediately became popular throughout the Chuanjiang River, showing its powerful vitality. This is indeed a remarkable technological innovation in water transportation. The pontoon boat is very simple to make. A few bamboo tubes or wooden sticks are tied to the sides of the boat, which increases the buoyancy and the carrying capacity is also increased. It is not too difficult to explain the principle in the middle. Of course, the importance of this matter does not lie in creating any profound principle, nor does it only lie in explaining how to solve an important technical problem, but in the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of this veteran worker. With this most precious spiritual quality, all difficulties can be overcome and anything can be done.

    Pontoon boats are very simple, very "earthy," and even unsightly. However, pontoon boats once again point out a broad road for technological innovation and technological revolution. That is, technological innovation and technological revolution do not necessarily require making technology complicated and cumbersome, but require people to use their talents to implement clever work. Some reforms are very simple, and the principles are easy to understand. Although it is a small innovation, it can indeed accomplish great things, break through major barriers, solve major problems, and increase work efficiency a hundredfold. It is precisely because pontoon boats are simple and easy to implement that they can most widely mobilize the masses and promote them universally in a swift and decisive manner. Although small innovations seem small, when countless small innovations become complete sets, they can converge into a huge revolutionary torrent, form a major technological revolution, and create earth-shaking and world-shaking great undertakings.

    From the creation of the pontoon boat to its widespread promotion in Sichuan, this matter has also given those who like big and dislike small, aim high and are impractical, and look down on small innovations and local methods a very vivid lesson. Technological innovation and technological revolution never reach the top. Innovation is endless and never stops. As long as everyone uses their brains and thinks about innovation at all times, they can always innovate. There are many ways to innovate, it just depends on whether people find them. Comrade Wang Shaocheng is such a thoughtful person, so he found the advanced, scientific, and simple method of pontoon boats. Simple and easy-to-implement innovative methods like pontoon boats, and local methods that solve major problems, are everywhere.

　　小革新　办大事
　　——见闻杂感
　　顾明
    四川省纳溪县在5月份迅速实现了木船运输浮筒化，船吨月产已跃居全省木船大面积高产冠军，并且把高产的红旗越举越高。
    纳溪县在四川省南部，位居永宁河和长江会合口。这个县90％的物资都靠这两条江运输。为了适应工农业生产发展需要，他们除了推行风帆、绞滩、夜航等先进经验外，并把很多的船都改了减少阻力的鱼肚船，大大提高了船只载量。可是这县的航运职工们在毛泽东同志不断革命的思想指导下，丝毫也不满足已得的成就，他们乘胜前进，千方百计地挖掘木船的潜力。果然，天下无难事，只怕有心人。有一位二十年工龄的船工王绍成，一天，他在工地修船，看见长江上游冲下来几只汽油筒，油筒吃水浅，高高地浮在水面上。他心里想，做几个类似的木桶挂在船两边，不是可以增加船的浮力，提高载量吗？于是连夜做了个模型试验，装上石头，果然比往常多装了一倍。他当晚就激动地把这个发现告诉了公司领导，党及时对这萌芽的新生事物大力扶植，支持和鼓励他，组织老工人来共同研究。经过大家两天的苦战，终于制成第一只木浮筒船，载重量大大提高了。但是王绍成还不满足，他又想出了用楠竹做浮筒的办法，克服了木料缺乏的困难。他在一只八吨的鱼肚船两边，捆绑一排楠竹，就使船只载量又提高50％到70％，船只的载量就是这样步步高升，越升越高。
    浮筒船一出世就马上风行千里川江，显示出它强大无比的生命力。这件事确实是水上运输一件了不起的技术革新。浮筒船，说起来很简单，用几根竹筒或几根木棒棒，绑在船身两旁浮力就增大了，载重量也提高了。解释这中间的原理，也不太难。当然这件事的重要性并不是在于创造了什么深奥的原理，也并不是只在于说明怎样解决了一个重要技术问题，而是在于这位老工人的社会主义积极性和创造性。有了这种最可宝贵的精神品质，就可克服一切困难，什么事都可办到。
    浮筒船简单得很、“土”得很、甚至其貌不扬。但是，浮筒船却给技术革新和技术革命再一次地指出一条阳关大道。这就是技术革新和技术革命并不一定要把技术搞得复杂、繁琐，而是要人们用才智实行巧干。有的改革很简单，道理也容易懂，虽然是小革新，可是确能办大事、破大关、解决大问题，千百倍地提高工作效率。正是因为浮筒船简单易行，它才能够最广泛地动员群众，雷厉风行地普遍推广起来。小革新看起来虽然小，可是当无数的小革新成龙配套之后就能汇成巨大的革命洪流，形成重大的技术革命，就能做出天翻地复、惊天动地的伟大事业来。
    从浮筒船的创造，到在四川普遍推广，这事也再度给那些喜大厌小、好高骛远、看不起小革新、看不起土办法的人上了一堂十分生动的课。技术革新和技术革命永远没有到顶的时候，革新是无穷无尽、永无休止的。只要人人动脑筋、时时刻刻想革新，也就永远可以革新。革新的门路是很多的，只是看人们找不找。王绍成同志正是这样的有心人，所以才找到浮筒船这个先进、科学而又简单的办法。像浮筒船这样简单易行的革新办法，解决大问题的土办法正到处都是。
