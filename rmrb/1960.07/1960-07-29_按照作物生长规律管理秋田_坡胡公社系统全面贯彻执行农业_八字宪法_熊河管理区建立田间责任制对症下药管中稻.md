    According to the Crop Growth Patterns, Manage the Autumn Fields
    Po Hu Commune Systematically and Comprehensively Implements the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture
    Xiong He Management Area Establishes a Field Responsibility System to Manage Mid-Season Rice According to its Needs
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Po Hu People's Commune in Changge County, Henan Province, has formulated autumn field management rules based on the growth patterns of various crops.
    During the autumn field management campaign, the Po Hu Commune launched a mass movement where everyone discussed experiences and sought the growth patterns of crops. Through this movement, the practices of the broad masses in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture since the Great Leap Forward were further summarized, and the growth patterns of various crops under different conditions were identified. According to the practical experience of the masses, autumn field management must focus on five key aspects: ensuring full stands, strong seedlings, vigorous stalks, ear development, and grain filling, while adhering to four principles: early, skillful, fast, and good. According to Ma Tongyi, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, strong autumn crop seedlings are an important foundation for increasing production. His experience in cultivating strong corn seedlings involves removing the surface soil around the roots of the corn when it is one foot deep, sun-drying it for three to five days, which promotes the growth of numerous rootlets, and then covering the soil and watering, which promotes the healthy growth of the seedlings. Following this experience, the commune's 33,000 mu of late corn have recently undergone widespread root-drying and seedling-suppression. Currently, early corn is in the grain-filling stage. In the past, many people believed that only watering was possible at this time and that fertilization was not feasible. However, according to experiments conducted by the Meng Pai, Hou He, and Po Hu brigades, a large amount of water and fertilizer is needed at this time. This year, based on this experience, a general application of grain-filling fertilizer has been carried out, and some teams have also implemented foliar spraying of phosphorus for a dual approach.
    In accordance with the requirements of early, skillful, fast, and good, this year, every management task for various crops was started early and carried out quickly and meticulously. In the application of human and animal manure to corn, surface application has been generally replaced by ditch application, hole application, and root-surrounding application to fully maximize fertilizer efficiency. Specific management measures have also been formulated for each crop, taking into account their characteristics. For example, the entire field management of corn should focus on eight key aspects: setting (seedlings), watering, fertilizing, weeding, pest control, soil cultivation, branch removal, and pollination, which the masses refer to as the "Eight-Character True Scripture." Even within the same management task, differences are made based on the characteristics and growth patterns of different crops. Specific management procedures have been established for each production team based on the different characteristics of various crops, and corresponding improvements have been made to operational methods. The first plowing of tobacco, corn, and sweet potatoes is generally suitable for deep plowing. This year, manual plowing has been generally replaced by a combination of row plowing and manual plowing, integrating human and animal power, with a depth of about six inches, increasing work efficiency by more than 85% compared to manual plowing. The implementation of the above measures has fully utilized people's subjective initiative and more systematically and comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, bringing field management work to a new level. Currently, all teams are aiming for "Eight Nos" (no drought, no missing seedlings, no weak seedlings, no weeds, no soil compaction, no pests, no poor management, and no third-class fields) and advancing towards high-quality field management.
    In the campaign to strengthen field management and achieve a bumper autumn harvest, the members of the Po Hu Commune have consistently maintained a strong spirit of fighting drought in the long term, firmly focusing on water management. They are seizing the current favorable opportunity of rainfall, vigorously promoting the integration of water lifting tools, digging water sources, and repairing canals, ready to continue to overcome the drought demon at any time. While focusing on water management, they have also launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on pig raising, designating July as a fertilizer accumulation blitz month.
    Currently, more than 37,000 laborers throughout the commune are participating in autumn field management daily, carrying out one to four cultivations, one to three thorough irrigations, and one to two applications of top dressing for the 33,400 mu of early autumn crops and 100,500 mu of late autumn crops, and promptly controlling pests. Now, the early corn stalks are seven feet tall and are pollinating and setting kernels, while the late corn is also as tall as a foot, presenting a lush green and pleasing scene in the fields.
    (Reported by this newspaper) In the Xiong He Management Area of the Yong He Commune in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, a field management responsibility system has been established at all levels, from the team and group to the field plot, forming a field management network. Due to meticulous management, first-class seedlings of mid-season rice account for 93.5% of the total rice field area in the area.
    The field management responsibility system in the Xiong He Management Area is as follows: leading cadres are assigned to designated areas and plots, task assignments are given to groups, and responsibilities for specialized management and field management are assigned to individual commune members. Management area cadres are assigned to teams, production team and small team cadres are assigned to plots, and work groups and commune members are assigned to field plots. Ninety cadres, fifty-four management work groups, and two hundred seventy-four commune members are responsible for the one hundred eighty-two plots in the entire area. In addition to each cadre being assigned to personally cultivate one to two mu of experimental fields and manage a high-yield plot, they are also assigned specific tasks, such as being responsible for water storage, water conservation, and disease and pest prevention, some are responsible for logistics, and some lead labor management work, etc.
    Since the transplanting of mid-season rice seedlings, this management area has continuously organized three upsurges in rice field cultivation and management. Each upsurge is based on the crop's growth characteristics during each period, as well as factors such as the natural climate and the thinking of the masses, and proposes effective measures to address the specific needs. For example, after transplanting, some cadres believed that the base fertilizer for this year's rice was sufficient and that the seedlings were transplanted early, neglecting early management and early top dressing. Geng Liangyu, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, who was helping this management area, went deep into the Liu Ren Fourth Small Team of the An Le Production Team to focus on key issues, discovered this problem, and immediately led a group of cadres and commune members to the Shi Qiu Mu Chong, where they inspected the seedlings plot by plot in the eighty-one plots covering more than one hundred mu, and found that forty-one plots covering fifty-four mu of seedlings were yellow and thin. They immediately analyzed the reasons and conducted on-site debates. At that time, some people said that there was no fertilizer for top dressing and that there was not enough labor to do it. They returned to the village and inventoried all the fertilizer sources inside and outside the houses, checking forty-seven manure cellars, seventeen cattle pens, and twenty-one manure piles one by one, and found a large amount of fertilizer. They also lined up the labor force of all fifty-two households in the village and found that twenty-two semi-able-bodied laborers were not working regularly. They analyzed the reasons, mainly the unreasonable organization of labor and fixed quotas for remuneration. Therefore, they adjusted the labor organization, revised the labor quotas, and convened a mass meeting to mobilize the masses. As a result, the team's production attendance increased from eighty-two to one hundred and four people. In three days, this small team's one hundred and eighty-four mu of mid-season rice rushed to weed the first time, and 60% of the fields were top-dressed with fertilizer. The entire management area held an on-site meeting of one hundred and forty people in this team, and the first battle of mid-season rice management was immediately launched in full swing. In mid-June, the entire area conducted another plot-by-plot appraisal of the seedlings and found that 30% were third-class seedlings. Therefore, the cadres assigned to the teams led the masses to eliminate the backward fields. In late June, the entire management area conducted a third review of the seedlings and found that the original first-class seedlings were showing signs of "sitting pulp," and the seedlings in some fields were in danger of lodging. In order to solve this problem, the secretary of the management area promptly convened a forum of experienced farmers, who decided to apply fast-acting fertilizer to the "sitting pulp" seedlings; and to take early sun exposure, apply burned ash, and promote the hardening of the stalks to the fields at risk of lodging, in order to prevent lodging. These measures have achieved good results.
    During the continuous organization of three upsurges of field management, the Xiong He Management Area also launched three blitz campaigns: fighting drought to protect seedlings, storing water to protect seedlings, and preventing diseases and insect pests. This was also led by the cadres of this management area taking the lead in doing solid work and in-depth and specific organization and leadership.

    按照作物生长规律管理秋田
    坡胡公社系统全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”
    熊河管理区建立田间责任制对症下药管中稻
    本报讯　河南长葛县坡胡人民公社，根据各种作物的生长规律，制订了秋田管理规则。
    在秋田管理运动中，坡胡公社开展了一个人人谈经验，个个找作物生长规律的群众性运动。通过这个运动，把广大群众大跃进以来执行农业“八字宪法”的实践，进一步作出总结，找出各种作物在各种不同条件下的生长规律。根据群众的实践经验，秋田管理必须抓好全苗、壮苗、轰秆、攻穗、攻粒五个关键，掌握早、巧、快、好四个准则。据公社党委副书记马同义的经验，秋作物幼苗肥壮是增产的重要基础。他培育玉米壮苗的经验，是在玉米一尺深时，扒去根部表土，晒三至五天，根部即生许多萌根，然后封土浇水，就能促进幼苗健壮。依照这一经验，全社三万三千亩晚玉米最近普遍进行了晒根蹲苗。当前早玉米正在长粒，过去许多人认为这时只能浇水，无法施肥；但据孟排、后河、坡胡等大队的试验，这时正需要大量水肥。今年根据这一经验，普施了一次攻粒肥，一部分队还进行了根外喷磷，上下夹攻。
    按照早、巧、快、好的要求，今年各种作物的每项管理工作动手都早，作的也特别快，特别细致。玉米施人粪尿中，普遍改表面施为开沟施、穴施和围根施，充分发挥肥效。还针对各种作物的特性，分别制订了专门管理措施。如玉米的整个田间管理，要抓好定（苗）、浇（水）、追（肥）、锄（草）、治（虫）、培（土）、打（杈）、授（粉）八个字，群众称之为“八字真经”。在同一项管理工作中，也都因作物特性和生长规律不同有所区别。针对各种作物的不同特点，各生产队都订出了具体管理规程，并相应地改进了操作方法。烟叶、玉米、红薯第一遍均适宜深锄，今年普遍改人锄为先串后锄，人畜力结合，深度达六寸左右，工效比人工锄提高85％以上。上述措施的实施，充分发挥了人的主观能动作用，更系统更全面地贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，使田间管理工作达到了一个新的水平。目前各队都以“八无”（无旱象、无缺苗、无瘦苗、无杂草、无板结、无虫害、无粗管、无三类田）为目标，向田间管理高质量进军。
    在加强田间管理，夺取秋季大丰收的运动中，坡胡公社社员始终保持着同干旱作长期斗争的旺盛士气，狠狠抓水。他们抓紧当前降雨的有利时机，大搞提水工具配套，大挖水源，整修渠道，随时准备继续战胜旱魔。在大抓水的同时，还开展了以养猪积肥为中心的积肥运动，把7月份作为积肥突击月。
    目前，全社每天参加秋田管理的劳力达三万七千多人，对三万三千四百亩早秋作物和十万零五千亩晚秋作物普遍中耕一至四次，浇了一至三次透墒水，施了一至二次追肥，并及时扑灭了虫害。现在早玉米株高七尺，正在授粉结子；晚玉米也高达尺许，田野里呈现了一片浓绿喜人的景象。
    本报讯　湖北红安县永河公社熊河管理区，层层建立了田间管理责任制，上自队、组，下到田丘，形成了田间管理网。由于管理细致，全区中稻一类苗占全部稻田面积93.5％。
    熊河管理区的田间管理责任制是：领导干部定点包片，培育任务定组，分工专管，田间管理责任分别定到社员个人。管理区干部包队，生产队和小队干部包冲畈，作业组和社员包田丘，全区一百八十二个冲、塝、畈，由九十名干部，五十四个管理作业小组和二百七十四个社员负责包干到底。管理区干部，除了各人分工亲手培育一到二亩试验田，管理一个丰产畈以外，还按条条分工，有的负责蓄水保水防治病虫，有人专管后勤工作，有人领导劳动管理工作等。
    自中稻插秧以后，这个管理区连续组织了三次稻田培育管理高潮。每次高潮，都是根据每个时期作物生长特性，以及自然气候、群众思想情况等因素，提出对症下药的有效措施。如插秧过后，曾有部分干部认为今年水稻底肥下得足，秧插得早，忽视早管早追肥。帮助这个管理区工作的公社党委副书记耿良玉，深入安乐生产队刘仁四小队搞重点，发现了这个问题，立即带领一批干部、社员在石丘木冲，一边参加田间劳动，一边对这个冲的八十一丘一百多亩田秧苗进行了逐丘检查，查出四十一丘五十四亩秧苗黄瘦，当即分析原因，并就地开展辩论。当时有人说，追肥没有肥料，劳力搞不过来等具体困难。他们又回到村里，对屋内屋外所有的肥源盘存摸底，把四十七口粪窖、十七个牛栏和二十一个粪垱进行逐个检查，查出大批肥料；又把全塆五十二户的劳动力排队，发现有二十二个半劳力没有经常劳动，分析原因主要是劳力组织和定额付酬不合理，于是调整了劳力组织，修订了劳动定额，召开群众会作了动员，因而这个队生产出勤由八十二人增至一百零四人。这个小队一百八十四亩中稻，在三天中抢薅了头道草，60％田追了肥料。全管理区在这个队召开了一百四十人的现场会，中稻管理第一个战役，立即全面开展起来。6月中旬，全区对禾苗又一次进行了逐丘鉴定，发现有30％的三类苗，于是包队干部分别领导群众消灭落后田。6月下旬，全管理区第三次进行禾苗排队，发现原来的一类苗出现“坐浆”现象，部分田的禾苗有倒伏的危险。为了解决这个问题，管理区书记及时召开了老农座谈会，决定对“坐浆”苗追施速效肥料；对有倒伏危险的田采取早晒脚，施火灰，促进禾秆坚硬，防止倒伏。这些措施收到了很好的效果。
    熊河管理区在连续组织三次田间管理高潮中，还开展了三个突击运动：抗旱保苗，蓄水保苗和防止病虫害。这也是由这个管理区的干部扎实带头干和深入具体组织领导起来的。
