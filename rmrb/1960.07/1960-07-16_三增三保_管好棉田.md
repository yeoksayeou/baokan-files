    Our cotton here has begun to bud, and some has already blossomed. We must immediately and properly seize the work of field management. As the saying goes: "Wheat is grown by planting, cotton is grown by managing." Managing cotton means managing cotton well from budding to flowering, so that cotton buds early, flowers more, doesn't shed bolls, and produces large cotton bolls, so as to achieve a great cotton harvest.

      Why Do Buds and Bolls Fall?

    In the past, people engaged in cotton farming all complained of headaches at the mention of cotton boll shedding. In our area, boll shedding used to be over 70%. I heard that bourgeois experts insisted that cotton boll shedding was a law, and that there was no way for people to change it. I think this statement is wrong. If cotton boll shedding is a law, why is there less shedding on the edges of the field and more shedding in the middle of the field? Furthermore, generally speaking, high-yield fields always have less shedding than large fields, and some high-yield fields have more buds and bolls on one plant than a single cotton plant in a large field. What is the reason for this? People will realize that the cotton on the edges of the field has good ventilation and light, while the middle of the field is heavily shaded; the cotton in high-yield fields is managed carefully, with ample fertilizer and water. There are many such facts, indicating that cotton boll shedding is not some kind of law, and that people can prevent it. As long as we manage and care for the cotton well, as long as we understand the nature of cotton, giving it what it needs to eat and drink, giving it light and wind, it will listen to people's instructions and grow, controlling cotton boll shedding, or even preventing it altogether. The facts are clear. Whoever has the idea that "shedding is inevitable" will have a low cotton yield, and whoever breaks superstition and tries to control boll shedding will see their cotton yield increase year after year.

    Some people, although they don't have the idea that "shedding is inevitable," believe that if the cotton has too much fertilizer and water, it will easily grow wildly, and the buds and bolls will fall off. This view is also worth studying. In recent years, some high-yield fields have experienced wild growth and boll shedding due to excessive fertilizer and water. However, some large-field cotton has not reached the level of sufficient fertilizer and water, and it also experiences boll shedding. It is clear that excessive fertilizer and water are not the real causes of boll shedding. The key is whether the water and fertilizer are used appropriately and at the right time. The timing and method of fertilization and irrigation are very important. We must be proactive, think of more ways to control boll shedding, and not complain and blame others, appearing helpless in the face of nature.

    Why does cotton shed buds and bolls? There are many reasons. First, pests. Since 1958, we have conducted some investigations and found that when you open up shed buds, over 70% of them contain boll weevils, cotton bollworms, etc. After cotton buds and flowers, it grows most vigorously and is also most susceptible to pests. Second, water and fertilizer are not provided in time or are not properly coordinated. Cotton boll shedding generally occurs more often in the upper buds than in the lower buds, and the buds at the tips of the branches shed more than those closer to the main stem. This shows that the buds closer to the lower parts and the main stem grow earlier, are closer to the roots, and can get nutrients first, so they shed less; if the buds that appear later and are far from the main stem are not given more water and fertilizer, they will lack momentum and easily shed. Third, ventilation and light are not good. People who carefully cultivate cotton know that there are the most buds in the dog days of summer, and there is also the most shedding. This is because the cotton plants grow tall, the branches and leaves are numerous and large, and the weather is hot. If they are not managed in time, they are easily steamed off.

    In general, the reasons for cotton boll shedding are both internal and external. The internal cause is the nutritional imbalance inside the cotton plant, with a conflict between growing branches and leaves and budding and boll formation, leading to shedding. This is what is called "physiological shedding" in books. External causes include strong winds, hail, high heat, and pests.

　  "Three Increases and Three Guarantees": Increase Bolls and Guarantee Bolls

    Once we find the reasons, we have a solution. As long as we carefully understand the nature of cotton, resolve its physiological contradictions, or raise vigilance to prevent various disasters, we can reduce boll shedding. In recent years, our cotton planting team has put forward the slogan of "Three Increases and Three Guarantees" for the management of cotton during the budding and boll formation period. That is: increase pre-dog days bolls, guarantee pre-dog days bolls; increase dog days bolls, guarantee dog days bolls; increase autumn bolls, guarantee autumn bolls. The center of "Three Increases and Three Guarantees" is to prevent boll shedding. "Increase" and "Guarantee" are two different things, but also the same thing. There is no "Guarantee" without "Increase," and only by "Guaranteeing" can there be "Increase." We must both "Increase" and "Guarantee," and the "Increase" and "Guarantee" must be carried out simultaneously. How do we say this? First, taking cotton growth itself, we often say that we must bring bolls into the dog days of summer. After bringing bolls into the dog days of summer, we can keep the cotton under control, not letting it grow wildly, and can distribute the nutrients evenly within the cotton plant. It grows both branches and leaves, and also flowers and forms bolls, which creates conditions for producing dog days bolls; guaranteeing dog days bolls also creates conditions for setting autumn bolls. From the perspective of farming measures, if we want to increase buds, increase bolls, and increase peaches, we must think of guaranteeing buds, guaranteeing bolls, and guaranteeing peaches. At this time, the addition of water and fertilizer requires a good coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and both the first and second watering must keep up. One ring connects to another, and each ring is tightly connected. In this way, the increases are increased, the guarantees are guaranteed, one effort is put in, and another effort comes up. The cotton grows vigorously all the time, with good color, and can achieve: one bud appears, one flower blooms, and one boll forms.

　  Manage Cotton Fields by Looking at the Sky, Looking at the Land, and Looking at the Cotton

    The specific measures of "Three Increases and Three Guarantees" are still the four words: water, fertilizer, protection, and management, and it is difficult to say which word is most important. They must be flexibly mastered and comprehensively used. My old experience is to look at the sky, look at the land, and look at the cotton. As the saying goes, every year we grow cotton, but every year is different. Therefore, cotton farming cannot be "the same every year." The current drought is very serious, and cotton field management must focus on water, and other measures must be carried out around water. When preventing drought and fighting drought, if pests are found, we must first prevent pests. If we irrigate water and then prevent pests, the pests will destroy the physiological structure of the cotton, and then irrigating water will not help. For example, if there is continuous rain in the later stage, we must cultivate, weed, and prune all at once to prevent the cotton from growing wildly and to prevent rotting leaves and rotting bolls. In short, we must act according to the sky, the land, and the cotton.

     In mid-to-late June this year, we began to irrigate the cotton. Someone asked: You said that cotton "irrigates the bolls, not the seedlings," so why are you irrigating so early now? I said, this is called looking at the sky, looking at the land, and looking at the cotton to do things. This year it is called "irrigating the buds, not the seedlings." The agricultural proverb says: "To harvest flowers, be dry in the fifth and eighth months (of the lunar calendar)." This means that during the seedling stage, cotton does not need too much water, and too much water will cause it to grow wildly. The roots will not be well established, and it will not be easy to guarantee pre-dog days bolls, so at that time it was "irrigating the bolls, not the seedlings." This year the situation has changed. Looking at the sky: since May and June, there has been no heavy rain; looking at the land: the soil moisture content is only 8% - 10%; looking at the cotton: the cotton leaves are dark green, and the time for the cotton leaves to "lower moisture" at noon is long. In such a sky, such land, and such cotton, if we do not irrigate water and do not conserve moisture, not only will we not increase buds and bolls, but even if we increase them, we will not be able to guarantee them; and even if we guarantee them, they will be small buds and small flowers.

  　How to Irrigate, Fertilize, and Prevent Pests

    How should we irrigate cotton? Our experience is: "The first watering is slow, the second watering is fast." Slow means that pushing today's watering to tomorrow is also acceptable; fast means that after the first watering, the second watering is urgent and must be done quickly. The reason is that cotton grows fast in the dog days of summer and needs a lot of water. Timely watering of the first water causes its internal cells to divide more. The cotton grows quickly, and at this time the weather is "one day of sun drying is equal to a hundred days of mud." If it does not rain for ten days, and the second watering does not keep up, the cotton's growth will slow down, there will be a conflict, and it will easily shed buds and bolls. Furthermore, how many times to water depends on the growth of the cotton, the soil moisture content, and the weather changes. When the soil temperature is very high, even if there is a light rain, we must consider the problem of irrigation. Because the soil temperature has not decreased, and the hot sun shines on it, the hot air in the field rises, which is most likely to steam off the buds and bolls. However, the amount of water should not be too large. When seizing autumn bolls, we must also irrigate water after topdressing if the ground is dry and there is no rain, in order to protect dog days bolls and promote autumn bolls.

    Water and fertilizer are the lifeblood of cotton. Applying fertilizer without irrigating water is not good, and irrigating water without applying fertilizer is not good either. The most important thing about cotton fertilization is to pay attention to technology, to be as early as possible, and to coordinate nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium well. Our experience is to look at the color changes of the cotton leaves. When the cotton plant shrinks and becomes smaller, and the cotton leaves are dark green, we must apply nitrogen fertilizer; if we find that the cotton leaves are light green and there is a tendency to grow wildly, we must apply phosphorus fertilizer; if the cotton is yellow and thin, we must quickly apply nitrogen fertilizer. The coordination of topdressing in cotton fields should be phosphorus first and then nitrogen, less first and more later, small meals and long streams. Phosphorus fertilizer can increase "three bolls," and nitrogen fertilizer can make "three bolls" grow faster. In the early budding stage, applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer can increase flower buds and guarantee pre-dog days bolls; after setting several pre-dog days bolls, applying more nitrogen fertilizer can promote cotton growth without causing wild growth; in late July, dog days bolls are growing, and there are still many flower buds on the tops of the branches. Applying some quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer can protect dog days bolls and increase autumn bolls; applying nitrogen fertilizer after the Beginning of Autumn can protect autumn bolls and promote large bolls.

    Pests are cotton's biggest enemy. "Don't be afraid of pests, only be afraid of not preventing pests." We treat them if there are pests, and prevent them even if there are no pests. This year, we have been preventing pests every three to five days from the seedling stage to now, and we have already prevented them twenty times, so there is no boll shedding phenomenon yet. There are many pests in cotton fields, and prevention and treatment must be strategic. According to the pests in different periods, use different or combined agents, concentrate on encirclement and suppression, and eliminate them in one go. In our area, there are cotton aphids, thrips, boll weevils, and cutworms in the early budding stage; cotton bollworms, pink bollworms, and plant bugs in the full budding stage; and red spiders in the early flowering stage, which are even more severe in arid areas; and the boll stage is mainly harmed by pink bollworms, loopers, and leaf rollers. In all places where there is cotton, it should be prevented at least four times, carrying out sudden attacks, preventing early, treating small, and curing, so as to protect most of the buds and bolls.

    How to Solve the Problem of Ventilation and Light in Cotton Fields

    Catching up with pest control and fertilization in management, solving the wind and light in the cotton fields, and adjusting the temperature in the cotton fields have become fundamental measures. People say "cotton likes warmth," but it actually can't stand heat or cold. After cotton is sown, if the weather suddenly turns cold, it will affect emergence and cause diseases; in the later stage, when the cotton plants grow tall, the sky suddenly becomes hot in the dog days of summer, and the cotton field becomes shaded, which affects boll shedding. This is the reason why the most flower buds fall off in the dog days of summer. Cultivation is a good way to regulate soil temperature, but unfortunately everyone does not pay much attention to it. People often say: "The hoe has fire, the hoe has water." When it is dry, frequent cultivation can lift and preserve moisture. The drier the land, the more cultivation is needed. Cotton fields that have been hoeed have dew on the cotton leaves the next day. In case of rain and waterlogging, frequent cultivation also has the effect of dispersing water. This solves the contradiction between cotton growth and temperature. Combined with cultivation, pruning in cotton fields is also very important, which can reduce nutrient consumption in cotton fields and make cotton ventilated and light. However, pruning must be flexible. Buds must be moved at any time; whether to remove vegetative branches depends on the situation. If flower buds have already grown, it is not necessary to remove them. Topping must be done in stages, and cluster topping must be flexible. For example, in the case of close planting, narrow rows can be topped, while wide rows do not necessarily need to be topped. Whether to remove old leaves also depends on the situation. If it is dry and there is no shading in the cotton field, removing old leaves will lose water. Keeping them will be beneficial to protecting bolls. In wet and rainy areas, first remove the old leaves on the main stem, and also push the plants together and build ridges.

    When cotton enters the budding and boll formation period, the situation changes quickly, and the measures must be flexible. As long as we are down-to-earth, go to the fields, observe and check frequently, look at the sky, look at the land, look at the cotton, and implement the "Eight-Character Charter," we can take the initiative and achieve: bringing large bolls into the dog days of summer, guaranteeing that dog days bolls are full of the waist, fighting for autumn bolls to cover the top, and achieving a great harvest.

　　“三增三保”管好棉田
　　全国农业劳动模范
　　中国农业科学院陕西分院特约研究员　张秋香
    我们这里的棉花开始现蕾，有的已经开花，要马上好好地抓紧田间管理的工作了。俗话说：
  “种成的麦子务成的花”。务花，就是要从棉花现蕾到开花管好棉花，叫棉花早现蕾，多开花，不落铃，结大桃，这样就能夺取棉花大丰收。
      落蕾落铃原因何在
    过去务棉花的人，一提起棉花落蕾落铃，都喊头疼。在我们这里过去落蕾落铃在70％以上。听说资产阶级的专家们，硬说棉花落蕾落铃是个规律，人是没办法改变的。我看这个说法不对。如果说棉花落蕾落铃是个规律，为啥地边的脱落少，地当中的脱落多？再看，一般丰产田，总比大田的脱落少，有些丰产田一个担子的蕾铃，比大田的一株棉花的蕾铃还多。这是啥原因呢？人们一想就会知道，地边上的棉花，通风透光好，地当中荫蔽大；丰产田的棉花管得细，肥大水又足。这样的事实很多，可见棉花的落蕾落铃，不是什么规律，人是有办法防止的。只要我们把棉花务好管好，只要摸着棉花的脾性，要吃给吃，要喝给喝，要光有光，要风有风，它就听人的话生长，控制棉花少落蕾落铃，甚至不脱落，事实摆得很清楚，谁有“脱落难免论”的想法，谁作务的棉花产量就低，谁破除了迷信，想法控制落蕾，谁作务的棉花产量就年年上升。
    有些人虽然没有“脱落难免论”的想法，可是他们认为棉花肥大水足了，容易狂长，笼不住就要落蕾落铃。这种看法也值得研究。这几年有些丰产田，因为肥大水足，发生过狂长，发生落蕾落铃现象。可是有些大田棉花并没有达到肥大水足地步，也落蕾落铃。可见肥大水足，不是蕾铃脱落的真正原因。关键是看水肥用得恰当不恰当，用到节骨眼上了没有。施肥灌水的时间和方法，有很大关系。我们要积极主动，多想办法，控制蕾铃脱落，不要东嫌西怨，在大自然面前表现得没有一点办法。
    棉花为啥落蕾落铃？有很多原因。第一是虫害。从1958年以来，我们作过一些调查，凡是脱落的花蕾，你只要打开花蕾一看，70％以上里边有象鼻虫、棉铃虫等。棉花现蕾开花以后，生长最旺盛，也最容易招惹虫害。第二是水肥没赶上，或者是配合不当。棉花落蕾落铃，一般的是上部担子的花蕾，比下部担子的脱落多，担子尖上的花蕾，又比靠近主秆的脱落多。这说明：靠近下部和主秆的花蕾，长的早，离根近，能先得到养份，脱落得就少；现蕾晚，离主秆远的，如果不再加水加肥，后劲不足，就容易脱落。第三是通风透光不好。细心作务棉花的人都知道：伏里的花蕾最多，脱落也最多。因为这时棉株长大，枝叶又多又大，加上天气热，一时经管不到，上晒下蒸，往往容易蒸掉花蕾。
    总的说来，棉花落蕾落铃的原因，一个是内因，一个是外因。内因是棉株内部营养失调，在长枝叶和现蕾结铃间有了矛盾，发生脱落。这就是书本上说的“生理脱落”。外因，就是大风、雹雨、高热、虫害等。
　  “三增三保”，既要增桃又要保桃
    找出原因，就有办法。只要细心摸清棉花的脾性，解决它生理上的矛盾，或者提高警惕，防止各种灾害，就可以减少蕾铃脱落。我们植棉小组，这几年在棉花蕾铃期的管理上，提了个“三增三保”的口号。就是：增伏前桃，保伏前桃；增伏桃，保伏桃；增秋桃，保秋桃。“三增三保”的中心，就是防止落蕾落铃。“增”和“保”是两回事，也是一回事，有“增”才有“保”，“保”住了，才能“增”，既要“增”又要“保”，“增”“保”同时并举。这话咋说哩？先拿棉花生长本身来说，我们常说要带桃入伏。带桃入伏后，就能把棉花蹲住，不狂长，能均衡地分配棉株的体内的营养。既长枝叶，又开花结桃，这就为产伏桃创造了条件；保住了伏桃也就给座秋桃创造了条件。再从作务措施上说，要想增蕾增铃增桃，就要想到保蕾保铃保桃。这时期的加水加肥，要氮、磷、钾很好配合，头水二水都要跟上。一环扣一环，环环紧相连。这样增的增，保的保，这一股劲下去，那一股劲又上来，棉花一直生长旺盛，气色常好，就能达到：现一蕾，开一花，结一桃。
　  看天看地看棉花管理棉田
    “三增三保”的具体措施，还是水、肥、保、管四个字，也很难说哪一个字最重要。要灵活掌握，综合运用。我的老经验，就是看天、看地、看棉花。常言说，年年种棉花，年年不一般。所以作务棉花，就不能“年年溜壕壕”。眼前旱象十分严重，棉田管理就要以水为纲，其他措施要围绕着水进行。在防旱抗旱的时候，如果发现了虫害，就要首先防虫。如果灌了水再防虫，虫害把棉花的生理组织破坏了，再灌水也不顶啥。比方到后期有了霪雨，那就要中耕、锄草、整枝一齐上，防止棉花狂长，防止烂叶烂铃。总之，要根据天、地、棉花行事。
     今年6月中、下旬，我们开始灌棉花。有人问：你说棉花“浇桃不浇苗”，现在为啥浇得这样早。我说，这就叫看天、看地、看棉花办事，今年叫“浇蕾不浇苗”。农谚说：“要收花，旱五、八（指阴历5、8月）”。这是说棉花在苗期，水分不要太多，水多了就要狂长，根扎不好，不容易保伏前桃，所以那时是“浇桃不浇苗”。今年情况变了，看天：从5、6月开始，就没下过透雨；看地：土壤含水量只有8％—10％；看棉花：棉叶黑绿，中午棉叶“下墒”的时间又长。这样的天，这样的地，这样的棉花，如果不灌水，不保墒，不但不会增蕾增铃，增了也保不住；保住了也是个小蕾小花。
  　怎样浇水施肥防治虫害
    给棉花怎样浇水呢？我们的经验是：“头水缓，二水赶”。缓，就是今天不浇推到明天也可以；赶，就是浇过头水，二水就紧火了，就要赶。原因是，伏天棉花生长快，需要大量水分，及时浇过一水，它的内部细胞分裂多。棉花生长就有一快，这时候正是“一日晒干百日泥”的天气，如果十天不下雨，二水赶不上去，给棉花生长来一个慢，就有了矛盾，就容易落蕾落铃。再说要灌多少次水，这要看棉花生长的情况，土壤墒情和天气变化来确定。在地温很高时，就是下过一阵白雨，也要考虑灌水问题。因为地温没降低，烈日一晒，地里热气蒸腾，最容易把蕾铃蒸掉，不过灌的水量不要太大，在大抓秋桃时，追肥后地干没雨，也要灌一水，才能保伏桃、促秋桃。
    水、肥是棉花的命脉。光施肥不灌水不行，光灌水不施肥也不行。棉花施肥，最要紧的，还要讲技术，要一早百早，氮、磷、钾配合好。我们的经验是，看棉叶的颜色变化。棉株萎缩变小，棉叶现深绿色时，就要施氮肥；发现棉叶现嫩绿色，有狂长趋势，就要追磷肥；棉花黄瘦，也要快追氮肥。棉田追肥的配合，要先磷后氮，先少后多，少吃多餐，细水长流。磷肥能增多“三桃”，氮肥能使“三桃”快长。现蕾初期，多施磷钾肥，能增花蕾，保伏前桃；在座住几个伏前桃以后，多施氮肥，能促进棉花生长，又不会引起狂长；7月下旬，伏桃正在长大，担子顶上还有很多花蕾，再施些速效氮肥，能起保伏桃、增秋桃的作用；立秋后追氮肥，能保秋桃，催大桃。
    虫害是棉花的最大敌人。“不怕有虫害，只怕不防虫”。我们是有虫就治，无虫也防。今年我们防虫，从出苗到现在，每三、五天防一次，已经防过二十次，所以还没有落蕾现象。棉田虫害多，防治要讲战术。根据不同时期的虫害，使用不同或兼治的药剂，集中围剿，一气歼灭。我们这里，初蕾期有棉蚜、蓟马、象鼻虫、地老虎等；盛蕾期有棉铃虫、红铃虫、盲椿象；初花期是红蜘蛛，干旱地区更厉害；铃期主要是红铃虫、造桥虫、卷叶虫为害。凡是有棉花的地方，至少应该防四次，开展突击，防早、治小、治了，就能保住大部分的蕾铃。
    怎样解决棉田通风透光问题
    管理上的防虫和施肥赶上去，解决棉田里的风和光，调整棉田里的温度，就成了一项根本性的措施。人说“棉花喜温”，其实它是热不得也冷不得。棉花下种后，天气骤然一冷，就影响出苗，发生病害；到后期棉株长大了，伏里天空猛热，棉田荫蔽了，又影响它落蕾落铃。伏里花蕾脱落最多，原因就在这里。中耕是调节地温的一个好办法，可惜大家都不太重视。人们常说：“锄头有火，锄头有水”。天旱了，勤中耕，就能提墒保墒。越是旱地，越要多中耕。锄过的棉田，第二天棉叶上就有露水。雨涝了，多中耕，又有发散水分的作用。这就解决了棉花生长和气温间的矛盾。结合中耕，棉田整枝也很重要，既能减少棉田养分消耗，又能使棉花通风透光。不过整枝一定要灵活。芽子要随时搬；打油条要看情况，已经长出了花蕾的，就不一定要打掉。打顶尖要分次进行，打群尖要灵活，比如是文武行种植，窄行可以打，宽行就不一定要打。打老叶也要看情况，天旱了，棉田也没荫蔽现象，打了老叶反会损失水分，留着它还对保桃有利。多雨地湿就先打去主秆上的老叶，还要推株并垅。
    棉花进入蕾铃期，情况变化快，措施要灵活，只要踏踏实实，到田里去，勤观察、勤检查，看天、看地、看棉花，执行“八字宪法”，就能争取主动，做到：带大桃入伏，保伏桃满腰，争秋桃盖顶，获得大丰收。
