    Leadership Emphasis is Key to Improving Quality
    Shunchang Foundry Constantly Focuses on Quality Meticulously, Maintaining High Quality and High Output for Two Years
    Shanghai Machine Factory One-Sidedly Pursues Output Value, Resulting in Massive Scrap of Castings and Many Difficulties in Production
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shanghai on the 7th) The fact that leading cadres emphasize quality leads to the masses emphasizing quality, achieving high quality and high output in an all-round leap forward; conversely, if leading cadres neglect quality, the atmosphere of emphasizing quality in the factory will become diluted. This truth is once again proven by the facts of the Shunchang Foundry and the Shanghai Machine Factory, which belong to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Mechanical Industry.
    The cadres of the Shunchang Foundry have a unified and comprehensive understanding of the output and quality of products—poor quality means that output cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, as early as the end of the year before last, when using high-sulfur iron to cast parts, they did everything possible to overcome the adverse effects on product quality caused by the many changes in raw materials, and created a set of experience in casting good castings with high-sulfur iron, controlling the scrap rate at about 2%; last year, the factory further mobilized the masses and strengthened enterprise management, with each process strictly controlled, and the average scrap rate for the whole year was only 2.71%; this year, the production task is even heavier, but because of adhering to various systems for controlling quality, the average monthly scrap rate is generally stable at about 2%. According to a 26-day statistic for June, it even dropped to 1.6%. Due to the good quality, the output has been relatively increased. From January to May this year, the average monthly output of each production worker reached more than 3.2 tons, which is a relatively advanced level in the city.
    When organizing and leading production, this factory has always paid attention to quality education, so that the idea of high quality and high output is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. When encountering scrap accidents, repeatedly examine them ideologically, so that everyone can learn profound lessons and further strengthen the concept of quality. For example, the scrap rate once rose in May. According to the opinions reflected by the masses, the Party branch immediately launched an ideological struggle among the cadres, criticized the blind complacency of some leading cadres and the erroneous argument of attributing the causes of scrap to poor raw materials, mobilized the masses to discuss extensively, and publicly exhibited the scrap, organized workers to visit the processing plant to see the serious impact caused by the factory's poor-quality castings, thus greatly improving everyone's sense of responsibility and rapidly improving the quality.
    The factory's leading cadres also often go deep into the production site to work with the workers, inspect the models together, check the casting situation and analyze the scrap. Once, a veteran worker made a cylinder, and two scraps were produced. He was very anxious and stayed in the workshop all day, repeatedly looking for the cause. When the Party branch secretary heard about this, he immediately went to the group where the veteran worker was to help him repair the mold and study some technical issues that deserved attention, which gave the veteran worker great encouragement and finally found the problem.
    Because this factory's work in grasping quality is thorough and meticulous, a good atmosphere of constantly caring about product quality and constantly paying attention to blocking the loopholes of scrap has been created throughout the factory. Once, when veteran worker Zhang Adong was making a five-ton large flower plate, he forgot to align the center line in a hurry when covering the box. When he thought of this in bed at night, he got up immediately and rushed to the factory in the heavy rain to remedy it.
    In order to ensure quality, various types of work actively cooperate in the work: when the modeling worker is modeling, he considers whether casting and sand cleaning are convenient; when the casting worker finds that the situation is not very normal during casting, he leaves a message on the blackboard to inform the modeling worker, and when the sand cleaning worker finds problems in the modeling, he also promptly informs the modeling worker. The close cooperation between the upper and lower processes not only greatly reduces the responsibility accidents in terms of quality, but also overcomes certain individual factors caused by the poor raw materials in time.
    The Shanghai Machine Factory, on the other hand, caused a large number of castings to be scrapped because the leading cadres one-sidedly pursued output value and neglected product quality. From January to May, the average scrap rate of castings was as high as 23.65%, and almost one ton of scrap was produced for every four tons of castings. The amount of scrapped castings in more than five months was equivalent to one and a half months of castings output of the whole factory.
    Some leading cadres of this factory have such a wrong idea that the total output value is a key indicator assessed by the higher authorities and must be completed, while the poor quality of castings, scrap and remelting only wastes some man-hours and coke. Therefore, they only pay attention to grasping the output value of the iron casting workshop and rarely grasp the quality. When the scrap rate is high and affects the completion of the output value plan, they do not improve product quality, but instead transfer to producing high-output value varieties, or require the masses to add more production to ensure the completion of the output value plan. Sometimes, the scrap situation of castings is really too serious, and the leading cadres only give a general indication and rarely help the workshop solve the problem specifically. The original quality index of castings was set at 95%. When the factory leaders saw that this index could not be completed, they did not mobilize the masses to find a way, but instead emphasized that the factory used tide mold modeling, and scrap was inevitable to be more, and lowered the quality index to 90%.
    The factory-level leading cadres' idea of emphasizing output value and neglecting quality has also affected the cadres of the workshop. The workshop cadres said: "The factory is headed by the total output value, and the output value is tight, so we can't manage the quality!" Therefore, some original quality assurance systems, such as the three-level inspection system and the scrap analysis system, were also crushed at the same time. The workshop originally had four full-time inspectors, but they were often not doing their jobs properly. At the end of the month, when the output value could not be completed, the inspectors and group quality inspectors had to be transferred to production. Sometimes the task of this product is too late, and other workers are transferred to rush to complete it. Because the workers who are transferred are relatively unfamiliar with this product and are not skilled in operation, the quality is unstable. Everyone grabs the task. When a batch of scrap is scrapped, they do not analyze the reasons and take measures. They often scrap it on one side and still cast it on the other. If too many tasks are dragged down in the first half of the month, the tasks will be added to each group and worker in the second half of the month. Knowing that more scrap will be produced in this way, they always think that grasping more products can make up for the losses caused by scrap. Under the influence of the leaders' one-sided grasp of output value and output, in order to complete the task, the workers have to be sloppy in operation, and more scrap is produced, and when more scrap is produced, the workshop cadres will more one-sidedly pursue output value and output, which forms a vicious circle.
    Now, with the help of the higher-level Party committee, the leaders of this factory have realized the serious consequences of neglecting quality on production, and are determined to completely change this situation, and are preparing to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, expose problems, so as to take measures to effectively solve them.

    领导重视是提高质量的关键
    顺昌翻砂厂经常深入细致地抓质量两年来一直保持优质高产
    上海机器厂片面追求产值铸件大量报废给生产带来许多困难
    本报上海7日电　领导干部重视质量，群众也就会重视质量，实现优质高产全面跃进；反之，领导干部忽视质量，工厂中重视质量的空气就会淡薄起来。这一真理再次被上海市机械工业局所属顺昌翻砂厂和上海机器厂的事实所证明。
    顺昌翻砂厂的干部，对产品的产量和质量有一个统一的全面的认识——质量不好，就保证不了产量。因此，早在前年年底用高硫铁浇铸件时，即千方百计克服由于原材料变动多给产品质量带来的不利影响，创造出一套用高硫铁浇出好铸件的经验，把废品率控制在2％左右；去年，这个厂又进一步发动群众，加强企业管理，道道工序分关把守，全年废品率平均仅2.71％；今年生产任务更加繁重，但因坚持了控制质量的各项制度，每月平均废品率一般都稳定在2％左右。6月份根据二十六天的统计，更下降到1.6％。由于质量好，相对地提高了产量。今年1月到5月每一生产工人的平均月产量达到三点二吨以上，在全市是比较先进的水平。
    这家工厂在组织和领导生产的时候，一贯注意进行质量教育，使优质高产的思想深入人心。遇到废品事故，反复从思想上检查，使大家深刻接受教训，进一步加强质量观念。如5月份废品率一度上升，党支部根据群众反映的意见，立即在干部中展开思想交锋，批判了某些领导干部盲目自满的情绪和把出废品的原因推之于原料差的错误论调，发动群众广泛讨论，并把废品搬出来公开展览，组织工人到加工厂去参观质量不好的铸件出厂后所造成的严重影响，从而大大提高了大家的责任感，使质量迅速提高。
    这个厂领导干部还经常深入生产现场，和工人一起劳动，一起检查模型，看浇铸情况和分析废品。有一次，一个老师傅做一种汽缸，出了两只废品，心里很急，整天一步不离车间，反复找原因。党支部书记听到这一情况，立即到这个老师傅所在的小组去帮助他修模子，研究一些值得注意的技术问题，给了老师傅很大的鼓励，终于把问题找了出来。
    这个厂因为抓质量的工作深入细致，全厂造成了一种时时关心产品质量，时时注意堵塞废品漏洞的良好风气。有一次，老师傅张阿栋做五吨重的大花盘，盖箱时匆忙中忘了对准中心线，晚上睡在床上想到这件事，连夜起身，冒着大雨赶到厂里去补救。
    各工种之间为了保证质量，在工作中主动配合：造型工造型时，考虑到浇铸和清砂是否方便；浇铸工浇铸时发现情况不大正常，就在黑板上留字通知造型工，清砂工清砂时发现了造型中的问题，也及时通知造型工，上下工序紧密配合，不仅大大减少了质量方面的责任事故，并且及时克服了由于原材料差给质量带来的某些个别因素。
    上海机器厂则因领导干部片面追求产值，忽视产品质量，造成大量铸件报废。1到5月，铸件的平均废品率高达23.65％，几乎每出四吨铸件就有一吨报废。五个多月铸件的报废量，相当全厂一个半月的铸件产量。
    这个厂有些领导干部，存在着这样一个错误的思想，认为总产值是上级重点考核的指标，一定要完成，而铸件质量不高，报废回炉，只不过浪费些工时和焦炭，因此，只注意抓铸铁车间的产值，很少抓质量。在废品率高而影响产值计划完成的时候，他们也不去改进产品质量，而是调做高产值的品种，或者要求群众把产量加码，以保证产值计划的完成。有时铸件废品情况实在太严重，领导干部也只是笼笼统统指示一番，很少具体帮助车间解决问题。铸件的质量指标原定是95％，厂的领导看到这个指标完不成，也不去发动群众想办法，反而强调厂内采用潮模造型，废品难免要多一点，把质量指标降低到90％。
    厂级领导干部重产值、轻质量的思想，也影响到车间的干部。车间干部说：“厂里是总产值挂帅，产值逼得紧，我们那管得了质量！”因此原来一些保证质量的制度如三级检验制度、废品分析制等等，同时被冲垮了。车间原有四个专职检验员，但经常不务正业，月终产值完不成时，检验员和小组质量员都要调去搞生产。有的时候这个产品任务来不及，便调别的工人来突击。由于调来的工人对这个产品比较生疏，操作不熟练，以致质量不稳定。大家抢任务，一批废品报废了，也不去分析原因，采取措施，往往一面报废，一面还是照样浇铸。上半月拖下来的任务过多，下半月就向各小组和工人层层加码。明知这样废品会出得更多，但是总认为多抓些产品，可以弥补废品所造成的损失。工人在领导片面抓产值、产量的影响下，为了完成任务，操作只好马虎些，废品也就出得多些，而废品出多了，车间干部就更加片面追求产值、产量，这就形成了恶性循环。
    现在，这个厂的领导在上级党委的帮助下，已经认识到忽视质量对生产所造成的严重后果，下决心要彻底改变这种状况，准备发动群众，大鸣大放，揭发问题，以便采取措施，切实加以解决。（附图片）
