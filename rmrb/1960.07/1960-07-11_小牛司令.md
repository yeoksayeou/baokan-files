　　I met the Little Cow Commander of Shuangfeng Commune at a heroes' conference held in the county at the beginning of this year. Just as the heroes were about to speak, suddenly, Secretary Zhang of the county party committee led a little child onto the podium. A burst of warm applause erupted, and the child twisted and turned, his face reddening from the roots of his ears all the way down his neck, turning him into a crimson-faced Guan Gong. The county party secretary held the loudspeaker close to his mouth, but the child, both shy and scared, turned his head away and refused to speak. The county party secretary whispered a few words to him, and only then did he lower his head, not daring to look at the audience, and began to speak in a trembling voice. Once he started, the child calmed down. His childish voice rose, he raised his head, and his bright, crystal-clear eyes sparkled as he spoke more and more openly: "I am an orphan. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved me, and they are even closer to me than my own parents. Letting me herd cows is what the Communist Party wants me to do. I'm always figuring out how to make the cows grow fat so I can live up to the expectations of the Communist Party..." Amidst a wave of warm applause, he stepped down from the podium, and I quickly went up to him and shook his hand, starting a conversation. From then on, we became acquainted and even became good friends.
　　It was also from that time that I learned about the background of the "Little Cow Commander."
　　The "Little Cow Commander's" real name is Wang Hansheng. He was not even two years old when his parents died one after another. He was not a local but had fled famine from the north. Therefore, after his parents died, he had no relatives or family. He was all alone. The neighbors took pity on him, providing him with food for ten days or half a month each. Although he became a skin-and-bones "dried-up monkey," he managed to survive. When he was just four years old, the Communist Party came and distributed houses and land, and he was officially raised by a neighboring family. Later, when the village established an agricultural cooperative, he also joined. Eating, clothing, reading, and writing were all covered by the cooperative. As he grew older and became more sensible, he knew that Chairman Mao was his great benefactor. He wrote "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Long Live the Communist Party" everywhere, in books and on paper. Over time, he wrote these few words the best. In 1958, the village established a people's commune. At that time, he was already thirteen years old and had just finished primary school. As soon as he heard about the establishment of the commune, he refused to study and pestered Branch Secretary Xiong every day, clamoring to become a commune member. Branch Secretary Xiong was so bothered that he had no choice but to assign him to herd cows. At first, he herded one cow, then it increased to two, three... all the way up to six. Because he focused on studying and carefully managing them, he fed the cattle so they were fat and strong. Moreover, he taught the animals to be obedient. With a whistle, the cows would automatically run over and be at his disposal. From then on, he earned the glorious title of "Little Cow Commander."
　　Crossing a hillside, in the gully on the opposite side, trees grew densely, vaguely revealing a thatched hut. Aha! My friend lives in there. To see him a moment sooner, I quickened my pace.
　　Reaching the door, under several large camphor trees, six fat and strong yellow cows were happily eating piles of tender Bahia grass. Perhaps seeing me as a stranger, one of the big yellow cows raised its head, widened its eyes, and mooed straight at me. The "Little Cow Commander" rushed out from inside. He was bare-chested, covered in mud, sweat streaming down his face. Seeing me, he pounced over. "Comrade, you've come!" He led me into his bedroom, washed his hands and face, poured me a cup of cold tea, and asked about everything. His enthusiasm was warmer than seeing a relative.
　　I looked around the bedroom, which was quite elegant. A pile of books sat on the desk, one of them still open. Several unknown flowers and plants were planted in two earthen pots, probably for treating the cows. The new mosquito net was white and clean, setting off the flowered bedding, just like a bridal chamber. One end of the wall was covered with various dried-up cow medicines; on the front wall, a portrait of Chairman Mao was neatly framed, with these words written in red paper below:
        "Chairman Mao, you are my dear parents,
  I will always listen to your words, feed the cattle
  so they are fat and strong, cultivate more land, produce more grain, and achieve
  mechanization as soon as possible!"
　　Below the portrait of Chairman Mao were certificates of merit issued by the commune, the county party committee, and other units. I said with a smile, "Little Wang, not bad at all!" But he replied seriously, "Comrade Tian, all this was given by the Communist Party. Like me, an orphan, I would have starved to death long ago if the Communist Party hadn't come." After a moment of silence, Little Wang told me, "I have a little trick, I don't know if it's legal or not, please give me some guidance." I said with a smile, "I still have to ask you for advice! Good, let's learn from each other." Little Wang jumped up, "Come on, right here." We both stepped into the cowshed together. This cowshed was designed by Little Wang himself. It faced south, with four large bright windows in the front and back. Inside, it was enclosed by small fences into six single circles. Each circle door was marked with numbers and names written on wooden signs, such as Cow Demon King, She-Devil... The whole area was dry, clean, bright, and snow-white. No wonder the cows were so strong. I repeatedly praised him.
　　Little Wang walked close to an earthen stove and pointed, saying, "This is the little trick." I carefully examined it. It was a stove made of earth bricks, with a chimney extending towards the cowshed. I immediately understood and said, "Good idea! Good idea!" Little Wang said, "Don't be happy too soon, it's not successful yet!" After a pause, he pointed to the chimney and said, "I want to install a live vent on top of it so that no matter the north wind or the south wind, it can blow through. Would that be able to smoke the cows?" I thought for a moment, clapped my hands, "Good idea! There's something to it!" Little Wang immediately started working on it. In less than half a meal's time, the live vent was installed. He brought a bundle of brambles, lit them and put them in the fire pit. The south wind blew gently, the vent sounded like "whoosh whoosh," and plumes of thick smoke spewed out of the chimney towards the cowshed. "Great, great!" "Great, great!" We were both so happy that we jumped up and down. I said, "Little Wang, what's it called?" "This... I've got it, let's call it the Live Vent Smoking Stove!" I asked him, "How did you come up with this?" "People and animals are the same. If there are mosquitoes on your bed, you can forget about sleeping soundly. If the cows are bitten by mosquitoes, how can they not lose weight!" Little Wang said:
  "The traditional method is to use brambles to make smoke. This method is good, but it has two drawbacks: First, a large pile of brambles is burned openly on the ground, the fire is too strong, and the cows can't stand it. Second, the smoke is too dispersed, and very little of it reaches the cows. Comrade Tian, to solve this problem, I asked masters everywhere and looked for solutions, determined to overcome these two weaknesses. After thinking about it, I finally came up with this little trick."
　　Because I had important tasks that were not completed, I could not delay too long, so I reluctantly embarked on the rugged mountain road again. When I climbed the ridge and looked back at the thatched hut, my ears were buzzing with the "Little Cow Commander's" cheerful childish voice: Chairman Mao, you are my dear parents, I will always listen to your words....
　　"Little Cow Commander, today you are steadfastly" fulfilling your promise!

　　小牛司令
　　田燕
    我和双峰公社的小牛司令相识，是在今年年初县里召开的一次群英大会上。英雄们正待发言的时候，突然，县委张书记拉着一个小孩子走上讲台。一阵热烈的鼓掌，小孩子扭扭捏捏，从耳朵根一直红到脖子上，成了个赤面关公。县委书记把扩音器凑近他嘴边，小孩子又羞又怕，把头一扭，撇了过去不肯讲。县委书记又对他耳语了几句，他才低着头，连台下瞅也不敢瞅，声音颤抖地说了下去。说开了头，小孩子反而镇静了。他的童音提高了，抬起头来，闪着一对乌亮晶莹的目光，越说越开朗：“我是一个孤儿，共产党、毛主席救了我，比我的亲爷娘还亲。放牛是共产党要我放的，我成天盘算着怎么才能叫牛长膘，对得住共产党……”。在一片热烈的掌声中，他走下了讲台，我赶紧迎了上去，和他握手交谈。从此我俩厮熟了，竟成了一对好朋友。
    也就从那时起，我才了解到“小牛司令”的身世。
      “小牛司令”本名王汉升，他出生不到两周岁，父母就先后去世，他不是本地人，由北地逃荒而来，因此父母死后，无亲无故，孤苦伶仃，左邻右舍念其可怜，你十天他半月的供给饭食，虽然成了个皮包骨的“干精猴”，总算活了下来。他刚满四岁，共产党来了，分得了屋宇田土，正式归一家邻舍抚养。后来村里办起了农业社，他也参加了。吃饭穿衣，读书识字，一概归社里负担。随着年岁的增长，一天天懂事了，他知道毛主席是他的救命大恩人，在书本上，纸本上到处写着“毛主席万岁”、“共产党万岁”。久而久之，就数这么几个字写得最好。1958年村里建立人民公社，那时他已十三岁，刚进完小读书。一听说成立公社，他书也不肯读了，天天缠着熊支书吵着要当公社社员，熊支书被吵得没法，只好分配他放牛。开头放一头，后来增加到两头、三头……，一直放到六头，由于他专心钻研，细心管理，把耕牛喂养得又肥又壮。而且把畜牲们也教得会听话，口哨一吹，牛儿自动跑来，任从摆布。从此他落了个“小牛司令”的光荣称号。
    翻过一个山坡，对面山坳里树木丛生，影影绰绰显现出一个茅棚来。哈！我的朋友正住在那里面。为了早一刻见到他，我加快了脚步。
    走到屋门前，几棵大樟树下六头肥壮的黄牛正在甜蜜地吃着几大堆青嫩的巴毛草。大概见我是生人，有一头大黄牛昂起头，睁圆着眼，唔——吗！唔——吗地直吼。“小牛司令”从里面奔了出来，只见他打着赤膊，满身烂泥巴，汗爬水流。一见我，扑了过来。“同志，你来啦！”把我让进他的卧房，他洗了手脸，倒杯冷茶递给我，问长问短，那股热乎劲，比见了亲人还亲喏。
    我打量这间卧房倒挺雅致。书桌上摆着一堆书，有一本还摊开了。两个土盆里栽着几种不知名的花草，大概是牛药。新蚊帐白生生的，衬托着花被褥花被子，恰似个新娘房。靠墙的一头挂满了各种干枯的牛药；正面墙上，端端正正地裱贴着毛主席像，下面用红纸写着这么几句话：
        “毛主席你是我的亲爷娘，
  我永远听你老人家的话，把耕牛
  喂得肥壮，多耕地，多产粮，早
  日实现机械化！”
    毛主席像下面是公社、县委等单位发的奖状。我笑着说：“小王，真不简单！”他却严肃地回答我：“田同志，这都是共产党给的。像我一个孤儿，共产党不来，早已被饿死了。”沉吟了一会，小王告诉我：“我有个小把戏，不知道那里不入法，请你指教一下。”我笑着说：“我还得向你请教哩！也好，我们来个互教互学。”小王蹦地跳起来“来，就在这里。”我俩一同跨进了牛栏屋。这间牛栏屋是小王亲自设计出来的，坐北朝南，前前后后有四个大亮窗，里面用小栏栅圈成了六个单身圈。圈门前都用木牌编有号码名称，什么牛魔王、母夜叉……满栏干燥洁净通明雪亮，难怪牛儿头头长得那么强壮罗，我连声啧啧称赞。
    小王走近一个土灶跟前，指着说：“就是这个小把戏。”我仔细打量，是用土块垒的一个灶膛，靠近牛圈前伸出一个牛尾巴烟筒。我立刻明白了，连忙说：“好办法！好办法！”小王说：“你不要喜早了，还没成功哩！”顿了一下，又指着烟筒说：“我想在这上面安个活风筒，不论北风南风，都能吹得到，这样是否可以把烟熏到牛身上。”我略一沉思，双手一拍：“好窍门！有门道！”小王立刻动手做起来，不消半顿饭功夫，活风筒安装好了。抱来了一把荆条点燃放在火膛里，南风习习吹来，风筒里呼呼响，股股浓烟从烟筒里向牛圈内大口大口地喷射。“好了，好了！”“好了，好了！”我俩高兴得蹦跳起来。我说：“小王，它叫什么名字呢？”“这……有了，叫它活式风筒熏烟灶吧！”我问他：“你怎么会想到这上头来的呢？”“人畜一般同嘛，如果床上有蚊子，你就休想睡落觉。牛如果让蚊子咬，怎么能不掉膘哩！”小王说：
  “历来的办法是用荆条熏烟，这办法好是好，有两宗缺点：第一，一大堆荆条敞放在地下燃烧，火力大，牛受不了。其次，烟太散漫，很少熏到牛身上去。田同志，为了这个问题，我就到处问师傅，找办法，一心想克服这么两个弱点，思来想去，终于想出了这么个小把戏。”
    由于我还有重要任务没有完成，我不能耽搁得太久，只好依恋不舍地又踏上了崎岖山道。当我登上山岭，回顾茅棚的时候，我的耳朵里嗡嗡地响着“小牛司令”那开朗的童音：毛主席，您是我的亲爷娘，我永远听您老人家的话……。
    “小牛司令，今天你正在脚踏实地”的实现着你的诺言！
