Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 22nd: The factories of the Shanghai textile industry mobilized the masses to break through the technical barriers of degumming, spinning, and coloring of wild fibers. The amount of wild and miscellaneous fibers used in blended products is increasing, the yarn count is getting finer, and the products are getting better.

Since April of this year, the Shanghai textile industry has been vigorously developing wild fibers. So far, more than 50 kinds of fibers have been put into production, including Apocynum venetum, cotton stalk bark, Flos Caryophylli bark, old bark, ramie bark, cattail, and Chloris virgata; more than 20 kinds of blended yarns from one count to eighty counts have been spun, and more than 80 kinds of interwoven fabrics and yarn-dyed fabrics have been trial-woven. The amount of wild fiber in blended products is generally more than 30%, and the highest reaches 50% to 80%. Some wild fiber blended interwoven fabrics for clothing, after printing, dyeing, finishing and processing, are both soft and brightly colored. More than 60 kinds of printed and dyed fabrics have been trial-produced, including high-grade products such as permanent electric light printed fabrics, printed fretwork patterns, jacquard printed fabrics, and waterproof khaki.

The use of wild fibers is one of the keys for the Shanghai textile industry to expand its source of raw materials and achieve continuous leaps forward. To turn those brittle and hard weeds and tree barks into something like cotton fibers, it is first necessary to break through the degumming barrier of wild fibers. However, using foreign methods for degumming consumes too many chemical raw materials; using natural degumming not only affects environmental hygiene but is also difficult to control quality. Some factories in Shanghai are looking for a simple method that does not consume too many chemical raw materials and does not damage the fibers. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 mobilized 2,000 workers to tap and hammer for indigenous mechanical degumming. Shenxin No. 2 Factory built an indigenous degumming factory, using the waste alkaline liquor from the dyeing and printing factory for degumming. This factory has also realized the mechanization of degumming, reducing the number of degumming workers per shift from thirteen to eight, and increasing the daily output of wild fiber degumming from 45 kilograms to 500 kilograms.

After breaking through the degumming barrier, they encountered the spinning barrier. At first, wild fibers could not be spun into yarn and could not be joined. After experiments, the workers carefully observed and explored its characteristics. In the process of opening and treating wild fibers, they reduced the processing steps and opened them loosely to maintain the elasticity of the fibers and reduce damage to the fibers. From opening to carding, after many reforms in technology and technique, they not only spun yarn, but also spun finer yarn.

    大闹技术革命  为纺织工业广辟原料来源
    上海总攻野杂纤维脱胶着色等三关
    据新华社上海22日电　上海纺织工业各厂发动群众，突破利用野生纤维的脱胶、纺纱、着色技术关，野杂纤维在混纺产品中的用量愈来愈多，纱支愈来愈细，产品愈来愈好。
    上海纺织工业今年4月起就开始大搞野生纤维，到目前为止，已投入生产的有罗布麻、棉秆皮、花香皮、老树皮、山麻皮、蒲草、龙须草等五十多种；纺制成一支到八十支混纺纱二十多种，试织成各种交织布、色织布八十多种；野生纤维在混纺产品中的量一般在30％以上，最高达到50％到80％。有的野生纤维混纺交织的衣著用布，经过印染加工整理，既柔软色泽又鲜艳。现已试制的六十余种印染布，其中有永久性电光印花布、印花回纹格、提花印花布、防雨卡其等高档产品。
    利用野生纤维是上海纺织工业扩大原料来源，实现持续跃进的关键之一。要把那些又脆又硬的野草、树皮变成像棉纤维一样的东西。首先就要攻破野生纤维的脱胶关。但用洋法脱胶，消耗化工原料太多；用自然脱胶既影响环境卫生又不易掌握质量。上海有些工厂找寻一种简便的办法，既不消耗太多的化工原料，又不损伤纤维。国棉二厂发动二千工人敲敲打打进行土法机械脱胶。申新二厂建成土脱胶工厂，利用印染厂的烧碱废液脱胶。这个厂并实现了脱胶机械化，脱胶工人每班由十三人减为八人，野生纤维脱胶日产量由四十五公斤增加到了五百公斤。
    闯过了脱胶关。又碰到纺纱关。开始野生纤维纺不出纱，接不上头。经过试验，工人精心观察摸索到了它的特性。他们在对野生纤维进行开松处理过程，既减少了加工过程，又开得松透，以保持纤维的弹性，少损伤纤维。从开松到梳棉，在工艺上、技术上经过许多改革，不但纺出了纱，而且纺出了较细的纱。
