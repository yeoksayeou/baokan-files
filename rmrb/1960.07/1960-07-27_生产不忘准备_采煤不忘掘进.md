Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 25th: With high yield as its goal, the Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province is strengthening tunneling work, actively organizing a balance between mining and tunneling, and completing its production plan ahead of schedule every month, with output rising month by month. In the first half of this year, raw coal production and tunneling footage increased by 1.83 times and 1.4 times respectively compared with the same period last year. The all-employee efficiency in June averaged two tons per worker, an increase of 57.7% over last year, and the consumption of pit props and the cost of raw coal were also greatly reduced, achieving an all-round and sustained leap forward in production.
Since the beginning of this year, with the improvement of coal mining methods and the acceleration of mining progress, the mine has faced the contradiction of tunneling lagging behind mining, which has affected the continued increase in output. At that time, some people advocated reducing output to achieve a balance between mining and tunneling. The Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the mine's Party committee resolutely criticized this negative view and practice, and adopted the approach of grasping both high yield and tunneling, taking high yield as the goal, accelerating tunneling, and actively organizing a balance between mining and tunneling, quickly reversing the contradiction of tunneling lagging behind mining. Now the mine's recoverable coal volume has always been maintained at about half a year, thus ensuring the continuous increase in coal production.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 25th: Leading cadres of the Jiaohe Coal Mine in Jilin Province are directing tunneling work at the tunneling faces, which has continuously accelerated the tunneling speed of the entire mine.
In July, the total amount of main lane tunneling in the entire mine exceeded the first half-month plan by 10.1%, an increase of 302% compared with the first half of June; coal production also exceeded the first half-month plan by 5.3%.
In order to ensure a sustained leap forward in the second half of the year, the entire mine is focusing on production preparation work centered on tunneling. The mine's Party committee decided to send "top leaders" from the mine to the team to grasp tunneling work. The entire mine is led by a Party committee secretary, a mine manager, and a chief engineer to lead tunneling work; each pit is equipped with a dedicated pit manager responsible for tunneling; each section and team is equipped with a dedicated section chief and team leader. At the same time, each department is responsible for a pit mouth or a working face, going down the well to grasp ideology, grasp measures, and carry out competitions.
After the leaders at all levels went down, on the one hand, they criticized the idea of some cadres emphasizing coal mining and neglecting tunneling, and on the other hand, they effectively solved the specific problems between coal mining and tunneling. The Wulin shaft of this mine, in June, only focused on coal mining and neglected tunneling, which not only failed to complete the coal mining plan for June, but also brought difficulties to production in the second half of the year. The working group led by the chief engineer, who came here to help, helped them solve six key problems such as insufficient transportation capacity, insufficient lifting capacity, and water seepage from the tunneling face, so that the tunneling speed of this shaft increased from an average of 7.5 meters per day in June to 13 meters in the first half of July, significantly improving the production situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 25th: The Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei Province conscientiously implements the policy of "simultaneous mining and tunneling," and leaders from the mining bureau to the various mines grasp both coal mining and tunneling with one hand. The entire mine always maintains a sufficient amount of recoverable coal for four months of mining, ensuring a sustained high yield of raw coal production. The entire mine completed half of the annual raw coal production plan six days ahead of schedule in June; from July 1st to 20th, an average of 1,038 tons more raw coal was produced per day than in June.
In order to strengthen tunneling work, all mines have adjusted labor organization, established professional tunneling areas and tunneling teams, and the number of tunneling teams is often maintained at half of the total number of mining and tunneling teams in the entire mine. On this basis, tunneling areas and tunneling teams were launched to carry out tunneling doubling competitions. In the competition, each tunneling area carried out technical innovation according to the weak links in tunneling, promoted advanced experiences such as double-eight-character relay slotting and one-time opening of the eight-character conical slotting, which greatly accelerated the tunneling speed. The 209 rapid tunneling team of Mine No. 1 promoted the advanced experience of combining long and short drill rods and forming a lane in multiple cycles at one time, improved the transportation of the tunneling face, and implemented methods such as double-layered iron plates and using reversing cars on the uphill, so that the single-person tunneling efficiency reached 0.678 meters, repeatedly setting a record of 645 meters per month.

This newspaper reports: Production never forgets preparation; coal mining never forgets tunneling. While fighting the rainy season and striving for high yields, the Jingxi Mining Bureau is also steadily strengthening tunneling work in an all-round way. From July 1st to 22nd, the total tunneling footage of the bureau exceeded the national plan by 13.74%, and the total output of raw coal also increased by 11.52% compared with the national plan.
According to the resolutions of the Party committee secretaries and mine managers' meeting on further strengthening production preparation work in the second half of the year, the mines under the bureau have further strengthened their leadership over tunneling work. By adjusting labor organization, new tunneling teams have been generally added. Workers in various mines adopted methods such as production games to promote advanced experiences such as "deep hole operation" and "relay slotting," and adopted effective tunneling methods such as "single hole slotting" and "bottom two-corner slotting" according to the different hardness of the coal seams to further improve tunneling efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 25th: The Party committee of the Zibo Mining Bureau implements the policy of simultaneous mining and tunneling. While organizing high yield, it earnestly strengthens tunneling work and effectively accelerates the tunneling speed.
At present, in this bureau, from the mine to the well, there is a secretary, mine manager, and well manager who specialize in tunneling. The mines promoted the rapid tunneling experience of the Sun Qiming and Meng Xiangui tunneling teams, and organized workers to carry out enthusiastic competitions. Through competition, 57 tunneling teams in Hongshan No. 2 vertical shaft vigorously promoted advanced experiences and new technologies, overfulfilling the operation plan by 2% in early July, and the tunneling efficiency increased by 35% compared with the same period in June.

    生产不忘准备　采煤不忘掘进
    鹤壁煤矿积极组织采掘平衡  蛟河煤矿派“头把手”抓生产准备
    井陉煤矿掘进组搞翻番竞赛  京西、淄博煤矿推广先进掘进经验
    据新华社郑州25日电　河南省鹤壁煤矿以高产为目标，加强掘进工作，积极组织采掘平衡，生产计划月月提前完成，产量逐月上升。今年上半年原煤产量和掘进进尺比去年同期分别提高了一点八三倍和一点四倍。全员效率6月份每工平均达到二吨，比去年提高了57.7％，坑木消耗量和原煤成本也大大降低，实现了生产的全面持续跃进。
    今年以来，随着采煤方法的改进、回采进度加快，这个矿出现了掘进跟不上回采的矛盾，影响了产量的继续提高。当时有人主张降低产量，来取得采掘之间的平衡。中共鹤壁市委和矿党委坚决批判了这种消极的观点和作法，采取一手抓高产、一手抓掘进，以高产为目标，加快掘进，积极组织采掘平衡，迅速扭转了掘进跟不上回采的矛盾。现在这个矿的获得煤量可采期始终保持在半年左右，因而保证了煤炭产量的持续上升。
    据新华社长春25日电　吉林省蛟河煤矿领导干部到掘进工作面指挥掘进工作，使全矿掘进速度不断加快。
  7月份全矿主巷掘进总量超额10.1％完成了上半月计划，比6月上半月提高302％；煤产量也超额5.3％，完成了上半月计划。
    为了保证下半年的持续跃进，全矿狠抓以掘进为中心的生产准备工作。矿党委决定，从矿到班都派出“头把手”抓掘进工作。全矿由一名党委书记、一名矿长、一名总工程师领导掘进工作；每个坑设一名负责掘进的专责坑长；每个段和班设一名专责段长和班长。同时，每一个科室包一个坑口或一个工作面，到井下抓思想，抓措施，搞竞赛。
    各级领导干部下去以后，一方面批判部分干部重采煤、轻掘进的思想，一方面切实解决采煤与掘进之间的具体问题。这个矿的乌林立井，6月份由于只顾采煤，忽视掘进，不仅使6月份采煤计划没完成，也给下半年生产带来困难。来这里帮助工作的以总工程师为首的工作组，帮助他们解决了运输能力不足、提升能力不足、掘进面渗水等六项关键问题，使这个井的掘进速度，由6月份的平均日进七点五米提高到7月上半月的十三米，显著地改善了生产状况。
    据新华社天津25日电　河北省井陉煤矿认真贯彻“采掘并举”的方针，从矿务局到各矿井领导干部一手抓采煤，一手抓掘进，全矿经常保持有足够回采四个月的获得煤量，保证了原煤产量持续高产。全矿在6月份提前六天完成了全年原煤产量计划的一半；7月1日到20日，平均每天又比6月份多生产一千零三十八吨原煤。
    为了加强掘进工作，各矿井都调整了劳动组织，设立了专业掘进区、掘进小组，掘进小组的数量经常保持占全矿采掘小组总数的一半。并且在此基础上发动掘进区、掘进小组之间开展了掘进翻番竞赛。各掘进区在竞赛中根据掘进中的薄弱环节，大搞技术革新，推行双八字接力掏槽、一次开帮八字锥形掏槽等先进经验，使掘进速度大大加快。一矿二零九快速掘进队推行了长短钎结合使用和多循环一次成巷的先进经验，改进了掘进工作面运输，实行了双道铺铁板、上山用倒翻车等办法，使单人掘进效率达到零点六七八米，连创月进六百四十五米最高纪录。
    本报讯　生产不忘准备，采煤不忘掘进。京西矿务局在大战雨季，力夺回采高产的同时，踏踏实实地全面加强掘进工作。7月1日到22日，全局掘进总进尺超过国家计划13.74％，原煤总产量也比国家计划增产了11.52％。
    这个局所属各矿根据各矿党委书记、矿长会议关于下半年进一步加强生产准备工作的决议，进一步加强了对掘进工作的领导。通过调整劳动组织，普遍增加了新的掘进小组。各矿职工采取生产运动会等方法，推广了“深孔作业”、“接力掏槽”等先进经验，并根据煤层不同的硬度，采用“独孔掏槽”、“底部两角掏槽”等行之有效的掘进方法，来进一步提高掘进效率。
    据新华社济南25日电　淄博矿务局党委贯彻采掘并举方针，在组织高产的同时，认真加强掘进工作，有效地加快了掘进速度。
    目前，这个局从矿到井都有一名书记、矿长、井长专抓掘进。各矿推广了孙启明、孟宪贵掘进队的快速掘进经验，并且组织职工开展了热烈的竞赛。洪山二立井五十七个掘进小组通过竞赛，大力推广先进经验和新技术，7月上旬超额2％完成作业计划，掘进效率比6月同期提高35％。
