More than three years ago, a British flag drooped sadly from the roof of the Parliament House in Accra; a tricolor flag was proudly raised, and the independent nation of Ghana announced its birth. However, at that time, Ghana was still an autonomous dominion within the British Commonwealth. Now, more than three years have passed, and Ghana is moving forward. Today, the Republic of Ghana is formally established. The people of Ghana are jubilantly celebrating the founding of the Republic and the inauguration of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as the first President of the Republic. The Chinese people extend their cordial congratulations to the people of Ghana and wish the Republic of Ghana growing prosperity and flourishing development.

Since Ghana's independence, the Ghanaian people have been gradually building their own country, developing their national economy and culture on the mess left by the colonialists. In March last year, Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah announced that the goal of the country's second five-year plan was to "lay a real foundation for Ghana's economic independence." Ghana will build its own industrial enterprises, its own airports, its own radio stations.... We firmly believe that with the establishment of the Republic of Ghana, Ghana's national economy and cultural undertakings will be further developed.

In recent years, Ghana's capital, Accra, has hosted international conferences that have made significant contributions to the cause of unity among the peoples of African countries, opposition to colonialism, and the striving for national independence. Ghana was the first Black African country to achieve independence after World War II. And today, looking around, a series of independent countries have emerged in Black Africa. The situation in Africa has undergone profound changes. Now, the establishment of the Republic of Ghana demonstrates the further consolidation and development of Ghana's independence.

China and Ghana have been continuously developing friendly and cooperative relations in recent years, and the friendship between the people of China and Ghana is growing day by day. Chinese Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen attended Ghana's founding ceremony. The trade and friendship delegation sent by the Ghanaian government, headed by Ghanaian Minister of Trade and Industry Kojo Botsio, also attended the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This time, our government has again dispatched our ambassador to Guinea, Ke Hua, to attend the grand celebration of the Republic of Ghana. All of this shows that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Ghana will be further strengthened in the days to come. This is also the common wish of the people of China and Ghana.

    祝加纳共和国日益昌盛
    三年多以前，一面英国国旗从阿克拉的国会大厦的屋顶垂头丧气地降下；一面三色国旗骄傲地升起，独立的加纳国家宣布诞生了。但是，那时候，加纳还是英联邦内的一个自治领，现在时过三年多，加纳向前迈进着，今天加纳共和国正式成立了。加纳人民正举国欢腾，庆祝共和国的成立和共和国第一任总统恩克鲁玛的就职。中国人民谨向加纳人民遥致亲切的祝贺，并祝加纳共和国日益昌盛和繁荣。
    自从加纳独立以来，加纳人民在殖民者遗留下来的一个烂摊子上逐步地建设着自己的国家，发展着民族经济和文化。去年3月间，加纳恩克鲁玛总理宣布，这个国家的第二个五年计划的目标在于“为加纳的经济独立打下真正的基础”。加纳将建设自己的工业企业、自己的机场、自己的广播电台……。我们深信，随着加纳共和国的成立，加纳的民族经济和文化事业将会得到更进一步的发展。
    这几年来，加纳的首都阿克拉曾经举行过为非洲各国人民的团结和反对殖民主义，争取民族独立的事业作出了重大贡献的国际会议。加纳是第二次世界大战以后，第一个走向独立的黑非洲的国家。而今天举目四望，黑非洲已经出现了一系列的独立国家。非洲的形势已经发生了深刻的变化。现在加纳共和国的建成，表明了加纳独立的进一步巩固和发展。
    中国和加纳在这几年间不断地发展着友好合作的关系，中加两国人民的友谊正与日俱增。我国聂荣臻副总理曾经参加了加纳的开国大典。而加纳政府所派遣的以加纳贸易和工商部长库埃多为首的贸易友好代表团也曾参加了中华人民共和国建国十周年的庆祝典礼。这一次，我国政府又派遣了我国驻几内亚大使柯华去参加加纳共和国的隆重的庆典。所有这些都说明，中加两国的友好合作关系在今后的日子里将会得到进一步的加强。这也是中加两国人民的共同的愿望。
