    Chengdu, July 26 (This newspaper) The leading personnel of Liziya Iron Mine in Guanyinxi Iron Plant, Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, comprehensively care for the lives of employees, continuously improve the diet and living conditions of the mining area people, so that the employees are full of energy and promote sustained leaps forward in production.
    Now, this mining area has raised more than 360 pigs, 450 sheep, and more than 3,500 ducks, with an average of one pig for every two and a half people, one sheep for every two people, and three ducks for each person. They also planted more than 110 mu of vegetables and more than 120 mu of sweet potatoes. The workers' diet is very nutritious. In terms of housing, most of the workers live in self-built brick and tile houses, wash their faces with hot water in the morning, and wash their feet with hot water in the evening. The mine also has postal and telecommunications, commercial, savings, barber, bath, sewing, laundry and other service organizations. Everything is available for daily life. In addition to regular leave, employees have one and a half hours of cultural study every day, and cultural, recreational and sports activities are also very active. Life is rich and colorful, and everyone has both work and rest. The workers praised: "The mine is better than home, and the Party is better than parents." Everyone is in a good mood and full of energy. From January to June this year, compared with the same period last year, the number of employees in the mine decreased by 34%, but the daily output of ore increased by 150%, and the cost per ton of ore decreased from 11 yuan to 3.5 yuan.
    Liziya mining area is more than 1,000 meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains. In the past, due to the poor living conditions in the mining area, many people did not work with peace of mind, and the production situation in the mine was relatively backward. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party organization of the mine strengthened political work, further boosted the enthusiasm of the workers, criticized the idea of a few cadres who did not care about the lives of the workers, and strengthened the arrangement of the workers' lives. The mine established a special organization headed by the secretary of the Party general branch, with workers and administrative management cadres participating, to specifically manage the workers' welfare work. The Party general branch also regularly checks and supervises to strengthen specific leadership.
    Fully mobilizing the masses and carrying out mass movements is the main method for this mining area to rapidly improve the lives of employees. Last year, the Party organization of the mine put forward to the workers the goal of striving for self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. The workers were determined to build the remote mining area into a beautiful home, using their spare time to pick up waste materials, forging more than 30 hoes in three days, building 30 pigsties in seven days, and renovating four caves as sheepfolds. The workers also bred and raised themselves, actively developing poultry and livestock. The workers of the mine used their spare time to reclaim more than 30 mu of wasteland, planted vegetables and feed, and gradually expanded the cultivated area to increase the production of non-staple foods.
    Doing a good job in the management of sideline production and implementing a reasonable distribution system are important keys to promoting the great development of non-staple food production. This mining area adopted the method of unified operation by professional teams and the combination of voluntary labor in terms of management, assigning tasks according to the management area, and implementing contract planting, contract harvesting, and contract breeding. In terms of distribution, the canteen implements self-planting and self-harvesting, self-raising and self-sufficiency; the professional team implements unified management and unified distribution. This has mobilized the enthusiasm of the workers to vigorously engage in non-staple food production.
    This mining area has actively strengthened the management of the canteen, carried out patient and meticulous education for the cooks, and transferred a group of Party members, League members, and activists with firm standpoints, advanced thinking, active work, selflessness, and concern for the masses to undertake the management and leadership of the canteen. Representatives elected by the workers formed a food management committee and established a system for regularly reviewing the canteen accounts. Due to the strengthening of political and ideological education for the cooks and regular inspections and appraisals, the quality of the canteen's meals, hygiene, and service attitude have been greatly improved. The cooks also actively used their brains to innovate cooking techniques and made a variety of cheap and good "innovation dishes" to ensure that the workers eat their fill, eat well, and eat hygienically.
    This mining area has established spare-time schools with the canteen as the center. In addition to equipping each school with a full-time teacher, it also adopted the method of "the able are teachers" to extensively carry out mutual teaching and mutual learning. Now, the entire mining area has basically eliminated illiteracy, and more than 90% of the people have been promoted to primary, higher primary, and junior high school classes.

    依靠群众改善饮食居住条件　大办学校提高职工文化水平
    李子垭铁矿全面关心矿工生活
    本报成都26日电　四川省岳池县观音溪铁厂李子垭铁矿领导人员全面关心职工生活，不断改善矿区人民的饮食、居住条件，使职工群众人人精神饱满，促进了生产持续跃进。
    现在，这个矿区已经养了三百六十多头猪，四百五十只羊，三千五百多只鸭，平均每两个半人有一头猪，两个人有一只羊，一个人有三只鸭。他们还种了一百一十多亩蔬菜和一百二十多亩甘薯。职工伙食很有营养。在居住方面，绝大部分职工都住上自己动手修建的砖瓦平房，早上热水洗脸，晚上热水洗脚。矿山上还设立了邮电、商业、储蓄、理发、洗澡、缝纫、洗衣等服务组织，生活所需，应有尽有。职工除轮休外，每天有一小时半的文化学习，文娱、体育活动也很活跃。生活丰富多彩，人人有劳有逸。职工们称颂说：“矿山比家好，党比父母亲”。大家心情舒畅，干劲十足。今年1月至6月份和去年同期比较，全矿职工人数减少了34％，矿石日产水平却提高了150％，每吨矿石成本由十一元下降到三元五角。
    李子垭矿区拔海一千多米，周围山峦重叠。过去，由于矿区生活条件较差，不少人工作不够安心，矿山生产情况比较落后。党的八届八中全会以后，矿山党组织一面加强政治工作，进一步鼓舞职工的干劲，一面批判了少数干部不关心工人生活的思想，加强了对职工生活的安排。矿上成立了以党总支书记为首、有工人和行政管理干部参加的专门机构，具体管理职工的生活福利工作。党总支也定期检查督促，加强具体领导。
    充分发动群众，大搞群众运动是这个矿区迅速改善职工生活的主要方法。去年，矿山党组织就向职工提出了争取蔬菜肉食自给自足的奋斗目标。职工们决心把荒僻的矿区建成美好的家园，利用工余时间拾废料，三天就打造了三十多把锄头，七天搭好三十间猪舍，并且修整了四个岩洞作羊圈。职工们还自繁自养，积极发展家禽家畜。全矿职工利用工余时间开垦了三十多亩荒地，栽种了蔬菜和饲料，并且逐渐扩大了耕地面积，增加副食品生产。
    搞好副业生产管理，实行合理的分配制度，是促进副食品生产大发展的重要关键。这个矿区在管理方面采取了专业队统一经营和义务劳动相结合的办法，按管区分任务，实行包种、包收、包养。在分配方面，实行伙食团自种自收，自养自给；专业队统一管理，统一分配。这便调动了职工群众大搞副食品生产的积极性。
    这个矿区积极加强了食堂管理工作，对炊事人员进行耐心细致的教育，并且抽调了一批立场坚定、思想先进、工作积极、大公无私、关心群众的党团员和积极分子去担负食堂管理工作和领导工作。由职工群众推选代表组成了伙食管理委员会，建立了定期审查食堂账目等制度。由于加强了炊事人员的政治思想教育，定期开展检查评比，食堂的饭菜质量、清洁卫生和服务态度，都有很大改进。炊事员们还积极开动脑筋，革新烹调技术，作出了多种多样的价廉物美的“革新菜”，保证职工们吃饱、吃好、吃得卫生。
    这个矿区以食堂为中心，开办了业余学校。除每所学校配备一名专职教师外，还采取“能者为师”的办法，广泛开展互教互学。现在，整个矿区已经基本上扫除了文盲，90％以上的人都分别升入初小、高小、初中班学习。
