    Crossing One Peak, Then Another
    —Miscellaneous Thoughts and Observations
    Gu Ming
    Having just read numerous reports in the newspapers about China's mountaineers conquering the world's highest peak—Mount Everest—we are now excitedly reading the news of Xie Wen's bold reform of the high-voltage bridge, climbing to new heights from the starting point created by Wang Linhe. The two stories illuminate each other, reminding us of the leaps and bounds of China's culture and technology. Under the guidance of the spirit of striving for perfection, and armed with the thought of continuous revolution, we cross one peak, then another, dashing forward without stopping!
    Wang Linhe, a worker at the Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, succeeded in developing the cutting-edge product, the 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge, after 371 experiments. However, with production practice, its shortcomings were exposed. Xie Wen, a young worker at the factory, carried out a major design reform, thoroughly reforming the design of the high-voltage bridge. The electronic tube amplifier is the main part of the bridge, but Xie Wen boldly replaced it with semiconductors. As a result, the volume of the high-voltage bridge shrank from the size of a desk to the size of a drawer, and it could be carried by hand instead of requiring three people to lift it. Consequently, the same amount of material could only make one high-voltage bridge before, but now the same materials can make twelve high-voltage bridges; one person's labor can also replace eight people's labor, and the product's use can even replace several. What a remarkable revolution, what a remarkable spirit of enterprise!
    This vivid and typical event vividly illustrates that China's current nationwide and comprehensive technological innovation and technological revolution movement, with its strong scientific nature, is surging forward wave after wave with extraordinary momentum. After we have worked hard to reach a goal, we continue to strive bravely towards another new and higher goal without stopping; after a new record is created, we quickly replace it with another newer record. The face of our technological innovation and technological revolution has truly reached a point where it is changing with each passing day, and early, middle, and late in the day are vastly different.
    Some places call production competitions and technological innovations "sports meets," and every producer wears the symbol of an athlete on their clothes. The facts of life also tell us precisely this: like Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu, they are brave, resourceful, and strong, enduring hardships and obstacles, and they ultimately climbed to Mount Everest at an altitude of eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-two meters above sea level.
    Of course, the technological revolution is endless, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results will never come to an end. There is no such thing as a summit when climbing the peaks of science and technology. After crossing one peak, there is another peak, and after crossing another peak, there are even higher peaks to climb. The road of science and technology, like the boundless sky, never has an end. Wang Linhe created a starting point, and Xie Wen climbed to a new peak. Every new creation and achievement is just a new starting point for every constantly innovating and revolutionary person. The end point is never there, and can never be found on this scientific road. Therefore, we must always move forward and never stop!
    May each of us learn from Comrade Xie Wen in technological innovation and technological revolution, and let us all become outstanding mountaineers like Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu in the movement to climb the glorious peaks of world science!

    跨过一峰  再跨一峰
    ——见闻杂感
    顾明
    刚刚从报纸上读过大批关于我国登山运动员登上世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰——的报道不久，我们又兴奋地读到谢文大胆改革高压电桥，从王林鹤创造的起点出发攀登新的高峰的新闻。两者辉映，使人想到我国文化技术的飞跃，在精益求精思想的指导下，在不断革命的思想武装起来之后，跨过一峰，再跨一峰，毫不停留地向前飞奔！
    上海沪光科学仪器厂工人王林鹤，经过三百七十一次试验，才搞成功尖端产品一万伏高压电桥。可是随着生产实践，它又暴露了缺点。这个厂的青年工人谢文进行了一次设计大改革，彻底改革高压电桥的设计。电子管放大器是电桥的主要部分，可是也由谢文大胆地用半导体来代替它。于是高压电桥体积从原来写字台那么大缩为抽屉那么小，原来要三个人抬，现在已经可以用手提。因而同样一份材料从前只能做一个高压电桥，现在同样是那些材料却可以制十二个高压电桥，一个人工也可以顶八个人工，产品的用途反而可以一个顶几个。这是多末了不起的革命，多么了不起的进取精神！
    这件生动而又典型的事件，形象地说明了我国目前全民的全面的具有强烈科学性的技术革新、技术革命运动，是一浪高一浪地迅猛异常地向前不断发展。我们艰苦奋斗达到一个目标之后，毫不停留地人不下鞍马不停蹄地就继续向另外一个新的更高的奋斗目标奋勇前进；一个新的纪录创造出来之后，我们很快地就用另一个更新纪录来代替。我们技术革新和技术革命的面貌，真是达到了日新夜异，早、中、晚大不相同。
    有的地方把生产竞赛和技术革新称做运动会，每一个生产者衣服上都挂着运动员的符号。生活的事实也正是这样告诉我们，像王富洲、屈银华、贡布那样勇敢、机智、坚强，历经险阻，使他们毕竟攀登到拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰。
    当然，技术革命是永无止境的，多快好省也永远不会到尽头。在攀登科学技术的高峰时，是没有什么顶峰可言的。跨过一峰，还有一个高峰，再跨一峰，还有更高的峰可以去攀登。科学技术的道路，就像天无边一样，永远没有尽头。王林鹤创造了一个起点，谢文攀上了新的高峰。每一个新的创造和成就，对于每一个不断革新和革命的人来说，都不过是一个新的起点，终点在这条科学的道路上是永远没有，也永远找不到的。所以要永远前进，永不停息！
    愿我们每一个人，在技术革新和技术革命中都向谢文同志学习，让我们在攀登世界科学的光辉的高峰的运动里，大家都成为王富洲、屈银华、贡布那样的出色的登山运动员吧！
