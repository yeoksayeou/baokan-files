　　Party Secretary's Diary
    May 17th
    Today, I participated in production labor at the Eighth Workshop and talked with five or six workers, including Jiao Fuqing. Regarding the issue of the low output in the large-sized work section, I had discussed it with several foremen. We all felt that the workers' enthusiasm had not been fully mobilized. In addition, I learned from conversations with several people that the planned figures should be given to the groups so that everyone has a target in mind, and they have a goal to work towards. But now the workers only know how to work, and they don't know how much is left to be completed. After this understanding, I found that the Eighth Workshop's failure to complete the plan was not due to a lack of materials or tools, nor was it due to personnel or machine tools. The main reason was that the plan had not been given to the workers, and the masses' enthusiasm had not been brought into play. Some cadres had blindly optimistic sentiments.

    Yesterday, together with the Party Branch Secretary of the Eighth Workshop, I convened a meeting of cadres at the group leader level and above. This meeting was very helpful in solving problems. Everyone put forward many measures, and also mobilized the masses to discuss the favorable conditions for completing the plan. Everyone felt much clearer in their minds and understood what to focus on, who would be responsible, and how to do it. Today, everyone's energy and the sound of the machines are different from the previous two days. The director, foremen, and adjusters all went to focus on the weak links, dividing their forces to guard the key points, focusing on preparation, material input, and the order of key product storage. Groups that completed their plans ahead of schedule reported their successes one after another.
        May 23rd
    Early in the morning, as soon as I entered the door of the Eighth Workshop, the lathe operator of the large-sized section happily told me: Our large-sized section has caught up, and the output has more than doubled compared to the previous few days. The lathe operator of the large-sized section has increased from only completing about 60% of the daily output to more than 180%. From these vivid examples, I have realized what it means to go deep into the front line. Going deep into the front line means analyzing phenomena, grasping the essence of the problem, and then purposefully mobilizing the masses to take measures. This is the only way to achieve victory. Only going to the front line for a superficial look, only seeing the phenomena without seeking the essence, is difficult to push the work forward.

　　党委书记日记
    五月十七日
    今天去八车间参加了生产劳动，并找工人焦福庆等五、六人谈了话。关于大型工段产量上不去的事曾和几个工长研究过，都感到人的积极因素没有充分调动起来。另外，我还从几个人的谈话中了解到：应把计划数字下到小组叫大伙心中有个数，干起活来也有个目标，可是现在工人就知道干，究竟还有多少没有完成，大伙不知道。经过这一了解，发现八车间没有完成计划不是材料工具缺，也不是人员、机床的影响，主要是计划没有交给工人，群众的积极性没有得到发挥，部分干部有盲目乐观情绪。
        五月二十日
    昨天和八车间党支部书记一起，召开了小组长以上干部会。这个会很解决问题，大伙提了不少措施，又发动群众讨论完成计划的有利条件，大伙心里亮堂多了，都明确了要抓什么，谁去抓，怎样抓。今天大伙的劲头和马达声都和前两天不同了。主任、工长、调整工都去抓薄弱环节，分兵把口，抓准备、抓投料、抓关键品种入库的顺序。提前完成计划的小组一个又一个来报捷。
        五月二十三日
    早晨，刚进八车间的门，车工大型工长就满面喜悦地向我说：我们大型可跟上去了，产量比前几天翻了一番多，车工大型从日产只能完成百分之六十左右，激增到百分之一百八十多。从这些生动的事例中，我体会到怎样才算深入第一线。深入第一线就是要分析现象，抓住问题的实质，再有的放矢发动群众采取措施。这是取得胜利的必经之路。光到第一线走马观花，只看现象不求实质，是难以推动工作前进的。
