Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The national chemical industry is taking the path of a vigorous technical revolution and "walking on two legs" to increase the production of chemical fertilizers to support agriculture. According to statistics from the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the total output of various chemical fertilizers produced nationwide in the first half of this year increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. Among these, nitrogen fertilizer increased by 75%; phosphate fertilizer increased by 1.92 times; and potash fertilizer increased by 2.41 times, thus significantly changing the imbalanced situation in China's fertilizer production, where the output of potash and phosphate fertilizers has historically been lower than that of nitrogen fertilizer. At the same time, the quality of fertilizers has also greatly improved compared to the past.

Since the beginning of this year, chemical enterprise workers in various regions, through systematic education on the worker-peasant alliance and practical activities such as factory-commune pairing to support agriculture, have further established the idea of agriculture as the foundation. They regard increasing fertilizer production to support agriculture as their glorious task. Through improving equipment, improving technological processes, and extensively adopting new technologies, they have continuously tapped production potential, resulting in a rapid increase in fertilizer production. For example, in the first half of this year, workers at the Jilin Fertilizer Plant proposed more than 17,000 rationalization proposals and implemented more than 160 major technological innovations, which doubled the production capacity of gasification, desulfurization, synthesis and other workshops. From January to June, the plant's synthetic ammonia production increased by 65.3% compared to the same period last year. After converting most of the original manual production processes to mechanized or semi-mechanized operations, the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company increased its production of superphosphate by more than double in the first half of the year compared to the first half of last year, and the unit production cost also decreased by 17% compared to last year. Currently, an average of more than 1,000 tons of fertilizer are shipped from this factory to 19 provinces and cities across the country every day. The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, which only officially started production in October last year, has also greatly improved its production capacity after workers comprehensively and systematically reformed the equipment based on the climate conditions of the plateau.

The conscientious implementation of the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and "simultaneous development of large, medium and small enterprises" by chemical departments in various regions is another important factor in this year's fertilizer increase. At present, in addition to a number of small synthetic ammonia plants that have been built in Liaoning, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hunan and other provinces, calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer produced using the original iron-smelting indigenous blast furnaces has also been widely developed. In the first half of the year, this type of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer produced by simple methods accounted for more than 40% of the national phosphate fertilizer output, becoming an important force in supporting agriculture. In addition, various regions have also used potash feldspar, alum, seawater, marine organisms, and industrial wastewater, waste gas, and waste materials to manufacture a large number of highly effective fertilizers. In Shandong Province alone, the output of fertilizer produced by small indigenous groups in the first half of the year was more than 100,000 tons, accounting for more than one-third of the province's fertilizer output.

Currently, chemical industry departments in various regions are also taking measures to further expand fertilizer production in the second half of the year. In addition to shortening the front and concentrating efforts to accelerate the expansion projects of fertilizer plants in Taiyuan, Dalian, Nanjing and other places, they are also trying every possible means to expand the source of fertilizer raw materials by mobilizing urban people's communes to run chemical industries and mobilizing the masses to go up the mountains to mine ores. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has also sent a large number of working groups to help key factories formulate and implement measures to increase fertilizer production.

### 化学工业部门大闹技术革命　化肥产量比去年同期增加一倍

　　化学工业部门大闹技术革命
　　化肥产量比去年同期增加一倍
    新华社16日讯　全国化学工业采取大闹技术革命和“两条腿走路”的办法，增产大量化学肥料支援农业。据化学工业部统计，今年上半年全国生产的各种化肥比去年同期增长了一倍以上。其中氮肥增长了75％；磷肥增长一点九二倍；钾肥增长二点四一倍，因而在很大程度上改变了我国历年来化肥生产中钾肥和磷肥产量较氮肥少的不均衡状况。同时化肥的质量也比过去有很大提高。
    今年以来，各地化工企业职工经过系统的工农联盟教育和厂社挂钩等支援农业的实际活动，进一步树立了农业为基础的思想。他们以增产化肥支援农业作为自己的光荣任务，通过改进设备，改进工艺过程和大量采用新技术等措施，不断挖掘了生产潜力，使化肥产量迅速上升。如吉林化肥厂职工今年上半年就提出了一万七千多项合理化建议，实现了一百六十多项重大技术革新，使造气、脱硫、合成等车间的生产能力得到成倍提高。1月至6月，这个厂的合成氨产量比去年同期增产了65.3％。南京化学工业公司在把大部分原来用人工操作的生产过程改成机械化半机械化后，上半年过磷酸钙的产量比去年上半年增产了一倍多，单位生产成本也比去年下降了17％。目前，这个厂平均每天有一千多吨化肥源源运往全国十九个省市。去年10月才正式投入生产的兰州化肥厂，职工们根据高原气候条件全面系统地改革了设备，现在生产能力也大大提高。
    各地化工部门认真贯彻“土洋结合”、“大中小并举”的方针，是今年化肥增产的另一重要因素。目前，辽宁、安徽、江苏、浙江、山东、湖南等省除已建成一批小型合成氨厂外，利用原来的炼铁土高炉生产的钙镁磷肥，也已得到普遍发展。上半年，这种用简易方法生产的钙镁磷肥，已占全国磷肥产量的40％以上，成为支援农业的重要力量。此外，各地还采用钾长石、明矾、海水、海生物以及工业中的废水、废气、废料等，制造了大量高效力的化肥。其中仅山东一省，上半年用小土群生产的化肥就有十万吨以上，占全省化肥产量的三分之一以上。
    现在，各地化学工业部门还在采取措施，争取下半年进一步扩大化肥生产。他们除了缩短战线，集中力量加快建设太原、大连、南京等化肥厂的扩建工程以外，还正在通过发动城市人民公社办化工、发动群众上山开采矿石等办法，千方百计地扩大化肥原材料的来源。化学工业部也已派出大批工作组，帮助各重点工厂制定和实现增产化肥的措施。
