　　Go Deep into Reality, Be Good at Making Decisions

　　These days, this newspaper has been constantly receiving letters from readers in various places reflecting how local leading cadres go deep into reality, deep into the masses, and improve their leadership style and methods. Although the specific situations in various places are different, they have achieved a common goal: strengthening the ties with the masses, strengthening the front line of production, and enabling leading cadres to be good at making decisions in practical work.

　　A letter from the Office of the Hong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei stated: Since the offices of the Party committees at all levels moved to the production teams, the broad masses of cadres have persisted on the front line and fought in the fields. Because cadres and the masses work together and live together, they have become increasingly good at making decisions in their work, and many problems that were previously considered difficult to solve have been resolved. For example, the Jianguo Production Team of the Yonghe Commune had long been unable to pay wages in a timely manner, and no reason or improvement method had been found in the past. Recently, Ku Changde, member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee and Minister of Agricultural Work, went deep into the production team and studied and discussed with the commune members, helping them improve labor management, etc., and the commune members' enthusiasm greatly increased. Comrade Shen Jinda, a reader, reflected that the work style of cadres in the Fodang Commune of Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, has greatly improved. Under the leadership of the secretary, cadres at all levels have stepped out of their offices and shared food, housing, labor, consultations, joys, and sorrows with the masses. Currently, more than 140 cadres have gone deep into the production teams, resulting in a double harvest in production and work. The Communication Group of the Mabian County Committee of Sichuan Province reported that the county, district, commune, brigade, and production team cadres at five levels went deep into the front line, managing both production and life. Their slogan is: "Go down and grasp everything, focus on the center and bring along everything else, each keep their own accounts, and then divide the work when we return," forming a new atmosphere of unified strength in all directions and unity between higher and lower levels for increased production.

　　The facts reflected in these letters show that only by going deep into reality can we proceed from reality; only by going deep into the masses can we unite with the masses, improve the level of leadership, and be good at making decisions.

### 深入实际　多谋善断

专栏：来信综述

　　深入实际　多谋善断
    这些日子，本报不断接到各地读者反映当地领导干部深入实际、深入群众，改进领导作风、领导方法的来信。虽然，各地具体情况有差异，但是，却达到了一个共同的目的：密切了与群众的联系，加强了生产第一线，使领导干部在实际工作中多谋善断。
    中共湖北红安县委会办公室的来信上说：自从各级党委办公室搬到生产队办公以后，广大干部坚持在第一线，战斗在田间。由于干部和群众劳动在一起，生活在一起，在工作中越来越多谋善断，许多过去认为难以解决的问题得到了解决。比如，永河公社建国生产队长期不能及时发工资，过去一直没找到原因和改进办法。最近县委常委、农工部长库长德同志深入生产队后，和社员在一起研究讨论，帮助社员改进劳动管理等等，社员干劲大增。读者沈锦达同志反映：浙江义乌县佛堂公社干部作风有很大的改进。各级干部在书记带动下，纷纷走出办公室，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同甘共苦。目前已有一百四十多个干部深入生产队，使生产和工作获得双丰收。四川省马边县委通讯组反映：该县县、区、社、大队、生产队五级干部深入第一线，既管生产，也管生活，他们的口号是：“下去一把抓，中心带其它，各记一本账，回来再分家”，形成了四面八方一股绳，上下一心为增产的新风气。
    从这些来信所反映的事实说明：只有深入实际，才能做到从实际出发；只有深入群众，才能和群众结合，提高领导水平，做到多谋善断。
