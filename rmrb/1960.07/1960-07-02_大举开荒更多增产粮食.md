Vigorously Reclaim Wasteland to Increase Grain Production Further
Huang Cheng, First Secretary of the CPC Hotan Prefectural Committee

The experience of continuous Great Leap Forward in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang, over the past two years proves that: while actively increasing yield per unit area, extensively reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated land area are important measures to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction in a way that suits local conditions and to develop agriculture at a high speed.

In 1959, while focusing on increasing yield per unit area, Hotan Prefecture reclaimed 300,000 mu of wasteland and expanded the area of multiple cropping by 100,000 mu. That year, the total grain output increased by more than 30% compared with 1958, the total cotton output increased by more than 166%, and the total output of oil crops increased by 70%.

At the time of liberation, Hotan Prefecture had only 1.9 million mu of cultivated land. By 1958, the cultivated area had expanded to 2.4 million mu, with an average of three mu of cultivated land per person. However, nearly 150,000 mu of these cultivated lands were orchards and pastures. The shortage of cultivated land and backward farming techniques led to the following contradictions in agricultural production: grain production could not be rapidly increased to meet the growing needs of the people's lives and the increasing population; the area of cash crops such as cotton could not be rapidly expanded, and harvests could not be quickly increased; and a large amount of pasture and feed could not be planted, which affected the development of animal husbandry.

How to solve these contradictions? Based on the favorable natural conditions of Hotan Prefecture, we mainly adopted the method of reclaiming wasteland to expand cultivated land.

Hotan Prefecture is located at the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains and south of the Taklimakan Desert, spanning approximately 200,000 square kilometers, with over 13 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. This area has a warm climate, a long frost-free period, and sufficient water, which is suitable for the growth of various crops. The 780,000 people of all ethnic groups, who are organized, have always had a high level of enthusiasm for production. Under such favorable objective conditions, we are determined to march into the wasteland and demand grain from the wasteland. The large-scale reclamation of wasteland in 1958 and 1959, with planting immediately following reclamation, rapidly increased grain production, expanded the area of cash crops, and promoted the rapid development of animal husbandry under the impetus of agricultural production.

In 1960, we further leveraged the superiority of the people's communes, which are larger in scale and more public in nature. The communes unified leadership and planning, and the production brigades mobilized manpower, animal power, seeds, and farm tools to organize large-scale battles and conduct long-distance, large-scale blitz reclamation. During the busy farming season, some of the labor force is drawn back, leaving some labor to level the land, straighten the canals, sow seeds, and carry out field management. This ensures that the wasteland is reclaimed, planted, and harvested without affecting the overall production. So far, 1 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the region, and more than 600,000 mu have been planted. It is estimated that all the newly reclaimed wasteland can be planted with crops by mid-July.

In the practice of these past few years, we have realized that there are many benefits to reclaiming wasteland, which has created extremely favorable conditions for us to achieve continuous and comprehensive leaps forward.

First, reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated land smoothly solves the contradiction between grain crops and cash crops competing for land. In the past, if Hotan Prefecture wanted to expand the planting area of grain crops to increase grain production, it could not expand the planting area of cash crops. In 1956, the region expanded the cotton area by more than 43,000 mu, and the grain planting area was reduced by more than 50,000 mu. In the spring of 1957, 4 million jin of grain were transferred from other regions. In 1959, 300,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, resulting in a bumper harvest of both grain and cotton. This year, the region has massively reclaimed wasteland and sown seeds, with grain crops expanding by 35.2% compared to last year, cotton expanding by 39%, and oil crops expanding by 24%. This further resolves the contradiction of grain, cotton, and oil competing for land and ensures the smooth implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing agriculture in an all-round way.

Second, the annual increase in cultivated land creates extremely favorable conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. In the past, grain was mainly used to supply food and seeds, with little being used as livestock feed. Therefore, animal husbandry developed slowly, with a net increase rate of generally 3%-9%. In 1959, due to the expansion of the grain planting area, there were a large number of agricultural by-products as feed, and animal husbandry had a greater development, with the annual net increase rate of livestock reaching more than 10%. This year, the region plans to reclaim 1.2 million mu of wasteland and plant a large amount of forage grass, so that the difficulty of insufficient feed and forage for livestock in our region can be solved, and animal husbandry can develop at a high speed. At the same time, a large number of pigs, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other poultry and livestock can be raised on these new cultivated lands.

Third, with the increase in cultivated land, forestry and horticulture can also develop rapidly. Hotan Prefecture has always been known for its rich production of walnuts, grapes, peaches, apricots, pomegranates, apples, and other fruits. However, in the past, due to the limitation of cultivated land, production could not be expanded. In the past two years, reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated land have created extremely favorable conditions for the development of forestry and horticulture production. In the past winter and spring alone, 30 new horticultural farms were built in the region, with a planting area of more than 20,000 mu of fruit trees. In the future, with the establishment and expansion of forest belts in the wasteland, timber forests and economic forests will grow rapidly.

Fourth, a large number of medicinal materials, wild hemp, and other wild plants and wild animals grow in the depths of the Gobi Desert, and mineral resources such as alkali and salt are especially abundant. Deepening into the Gobi to reclaim wasteland can allow us to engage in the digging of medicinal materials, peeling of wild hemp, mining of alkali, digging of salt, hunting, and raising of wild animals nearby. According to incomplete statistics for only four months, the income from sideline occupations in the wasteland has reached more than 490,000 yuan.

Fifth, large-scale wasteland reclamation promotes the development of water conservancy construction. In Xinjiang, large-scale wasteland reclamation must be accompanied by water conservancy construction. Without water, production is impossible. The irrigation characteristics of Hotan Prefecture are: relying on snowmelt from the Kunlun Mountains for irrigation, with large water volumes in summer and autumn, and small water volumes in winter and spring. However, the sowing season is mainly in the spring. To solve this contradiction, new water conservancy projects must be built, water conservancy facilities must be further improved, and water conservancy management must be strengthened to solve the water use problem. This forces us to build large and medium-sized reservoirs to store floodwater and use floodwater for irrigation. Since the winter water conservancy construction, the region has completed five reservoirs with a storage capacity of 54 million cubic meters, built 83 main canals with a total length of 632 kilometers (including 12 dry-laid cobblestone canals through the Gobi gravel, with a length of 45 kilometers), and renovated more than 1.2 million mu of old irrigation areas, expanding the irrigated area by 700,000 mu and improving the irrigation area by 320,000 mu.

In addition, the newly reclaimed wasteland has adopted the method of unified leadership and unified planning from the beginning. Forest belts, roads, canals, settlements, and fields are all constructed according to high standards. As soon as the land is reclaimed, it forms flat and contiguous farmland, which lays the foundation for future mechanized farming.

Expanding the cultivated area has a huge role in promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline occupations, in strengthening the collective economic strength, and in changing the poor face of Hotan. Therefore, cadres and masses in the region have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland and expanding the cultivated area. As long as we earnestly summarize the existing experience, further improve our work, and continue to march into the wasteland on the basis of existing victories, and launch another large-scale mass movement of wasteland reclamation and farmland creation this winter, we can achieve the plan of having five mu of land per person within this year.

    大举开荒更多增产粮食
    中共和田地委第一书记　黄诚
    新疆和田专区两年来连续大跃进的经验证明：在积极提高单位面积产量的同时，大量开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，是因地制宜贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，高速度发展农业的重要措施。
    1959年，和田地区在抓提高单位产量的同时，开荒三十万亩，扩大复播面积十万亩。这年粮食总产量比1958年增长30％多，棉花总产量增长166％以上，油料作物总产量增长70％。
    和田解放时，全区仅有耕地一百九十万亩。到1958年，耕地面积扩大到二百四十万亩，平均每人占有耕地三亩。但在这些耕地中，还有近十五万亩的果园和牧草地。耕地少，耕作技术落后，在农业生产上就出现了这样几个矛盾：粮食不能迅速增产，满足不了人民生活日益提高和人口日益增长的需要；棉花等经济作物面积不能迅速扩大，收获不能很快增加；不能大量种植牧草和饲料，影响畜牧生产发展。
    如何解决这些矛盾呢？我们根据和田地区有利的自然条件，主要采取了开荒扩大耕地的办法。
    和田专区地处昆仑山北麓，塔克拉玛干大沙漠以南，纵横约二十万平方公里，可耕荒地有一千三百多万亩。这个地区气候温暖，无霜期长，水量充足，适宜各种作物的生长。组织起来的七十八万各族人民生产干劲一直很高。在这样良好的客观条件下，我们下决心向荒地进军，向荒地要粮。1958年和1959年两年大举开荒，随开随种，粮食产量迅速提高，经济作物面积扩大，畜牧业也在农业生产的带动下获得迅速发展。
    1960年，我们进一步发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，公社统一领导，统一规划，生产大队抽调人力、畜力、种籽、农具，组织大兵团作战，进行远距离的大规模的突击开荒。农忙时，则将部分劳动力抽回，留下部分劳力平地、整渠、播种和进行田间管理。这样作既不影响整个生产，又能保证荒地有开、有种、有收。到现在全区已开荒一百万亩，种上六十多万亩，预计到7月中旬全部新垦荒地都可以种上庄稼。
    在这几年的实践中，我们体会到开荒好处很多，它给我们创造了连续全面跃进的极为有利的条件。
    一，开荒扩大耕地，顺利地解决了粮食作物和经济作物争地的矛盾。过去，和田专区要扩大粮食播种面积增产粮食，就不能扩大经济作物播种面积。1956年，全区扩大棉花面积四万三千多亩，粮食播种面积就缩小了五万多亩，1957年春季，还从外区调运来四百万斤粮食。1959年开荒三十万亩，获得了粮棉双丰收。今年全区大量开荒播种，粮食作物比去年扩大35.2％，棉花扩大39％，油料扩大24％。这就进一步解决了粮、棉、油争地的矛盾，保证了以粮为纲、全面发展农业方针的顺利执行。
    二，耕地逐年的增加，为畜牧业高速度发展创造了极为有利的条件。过去粮食主要供应口粮和种籽的需要，作为牲畜饲料的不多。所以畜牧业发展较慢，净增率一般是3％—9％。1959年由于扩大了粮食播种面积，有了大量的农业副产品作为饲料，畜牧业即有较大的发展，全年牲畜净增率达到10％以上。今年全区计划开荒一百二十万亩，大量种植饲草，这样，我区牲畜饲料、饲草不足的困难就可解决，使畜牧业高速度向前发展。同时，在这些新的耕地上还可大量喂养猪、鸡、鸭、兔等家禽家畜。
    三，随着耕地的增加，林业、园艺也能迅速地发展起来。和田地区向以盛产核桃、葡萄、桃、杏、石榴、苹果等果品著称。但过去由于耕地的限制，总是不能扩大生产。近两年来，开荒造田扩大耕地，给发展林业和园艺生产创造了极有利的条件。仅去冬今春，全区即新建起园艺场三十个，种植果树面积达两万多亩。今后，随着荒地林带的建立和扩大，用材林、经济林都将迅速成长起来。
    四，戈壁深处生长着大量的药材、野麻等野生植物和野生动物，矿产资源如碱、盐等尤其丰富。深入戈壁开荒，就可以就近开展挖药材、剥野麻、采碱、挖盐、狩猎、饲养野生动物。仅据四个月不完全统计，在荒地上的副业收入，就达四十九万多元。
    五，大量开荒促进了水利建设的发展。在新疆地区要大量开荒，必须同时兴修水利。没有水根本无法生产。和田专区的灌溉特点是：依靠昆仑山上的融雪灌溉，夏秋水量大，冬春水量小。但是播种季节主要在春季。要解决这个矛盾必须修建新的水利工程，进一步改进水利设施，加强水利管理以解决用水问题。这就逼着我们要建立大中型水库蓄洪水和利用洪水进行灌溉。从去冬兴修水利以来，全区已修成水库五座，蓄水五千四百万公方，修成干渠八十三条，长六百三十二公里（其中通过戈壁砾石的干砌卵石渠道十二条，长四十五公里），改建旧灌区一百二十万亩以上，共扩大灌溉面积七十万亩，改善灌溉面积三十二万亩。
    此外，新垦荒地由于一开始就采取了统一领导、统一规划的办法，林带、道路、渠道、居民点、田块都按高标准的要求进行，地一开出，即形成平整的连片的农田，为将来实行机耕打好了基础。
    扩大耕地面积对于促进农业、牧业、林业、副业的全面发展，对于壮大社有经济力量，对于改变和田的贫穷面貌等方面的作用是巨大的。因此全区干部和群众对开荒扩大耕地面积表现了空前未有的积极性。只要我们认真总结已有经验，进一步做好工作，在已有胜利的基础上继续向荒地进军，今年冬季再开展一次大规模的开荒造田的群众运动，我们就可以在今年内实现每人有地五亩的计划。
