Master Qin Goes to the Countryside

One afternoon at the end of June, the sun was scorching hot. Qin Liangren, a master craftsman from the Guilin Forging Press Machine Factory, sat in a long-distance bus heading to Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County, constantly wiping the sweat from his forehead. His eyes gazed out the window, where he saw boundless fields seemingly spitting out sparks, and the lush crops bowed their heads low. Seeing these scenes, Master Qin wished he could immediately spread his wings and fly to Longsheng to help the farmer brothers repair the water pumps and make the drought demon bow its head as soon as possible. It was already dusk when he arrived in Longsheng. As soon as he got off the bus, Master Qin said to the welcoming farmer brothers: "Where are the machines that need to be repaired? Take me to see them quickly!" "No, you've just arrived, rest first, and work tomorrow!" Zhang Ming, the Party Branch Secretary of the Heping Commune, replied kindly, holding Master Qin's hand. Ignoring Secretary Zhang's dissuasion, he pulled the secretary along and left.

Next to the machines, Secretary Zhang explained the situation in detail: "This is a gas engine that has been stored for more than a year, and that is a diesel engine that has been used for three or four years...". Master Qin led Xiao Wang, a member of the Communist Youth League in the commune, to disassemble and check the machine parts, down to every screw, again and again, until they found the faults of each machine and each part before returning to their lodgings.

That night, Master Qin tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep, thinking: "The faults of the machines have been found, but how can the parts be matched?" After thinking it over, he could only draw drawings based on the old parts and send them back to the factory for processing. Once he had decided on this idea, he immediately got up to draw, and the next day, before dawn, he sent the rough drawings away.

Two days later, Master Qin repaired all the repairable parts, and the machine parts processed by the factory also happened to arrive. He immediately led Xiao Wang to install them while imparting maintenance techniques, repairing the machines and training machine repair personnel. Thanks to Master Qin's tireless work day and night, the commune's task of repairing more than ten irrigation and drainage machines was completed ten days ahead of schedule. Before leaving, the commune held a farewell party, and Master Qin accepted the red flag presented by the commune on behalf of the factory. (Mǐn jí)

    秦师傅下乡
    6月底的一天下午，烈日炎炎。桂林锻压机械厂秦良仁师傅坐在开往龙胜各族自治县的长途汽车里，不停地擦着额上的汗珠，两眼向窗外了望，只见一望无垠的田野好像喷出火花，茂盛的庄稼垂腰低头。秦师傅看到这些景象，恨不得马上展翅飞到龙胜，协助农民兄弟把抽水机修好，叫旱魔早日低头。到达龙胜已是夜色苍茫了。一下车，秦师傅就向欢迎的农民弟兄说：要修理的机器在哪里，快带我去看。“不，你刚来，先休息一下，明天再干吧！”和平公社的党支部书记张明握着秦师傅的手亲切地回答着。他不听张书记的劝阻，拉着书记就走了。
    在机器旁，张书记详尽地介绍着情况：这是放了一年多的煤气机，那是用了三、四年的柴油机……。秦师傅带领公社的共青团员小王从机器部件到每一颗螺丝，拆了又拆，查了又查，一直把每部机器、每个零件的毛病都找到了才回到住宿的地方。
    当夜，秦师傅躺在床上翻来复去，不能入睡，心想：机器的毛病找出来了，零件怎么配齐呢？想来想去，只有自己根据旧零件画图，寄回厂里去加工。主意一定，立即起床画图，第二天天还未亮，就把草图寄走了。
    两天后，秦师傅把可修理的部件全修好了，厂里加工的机件也恰好寄来了，他立即带领小王边安装、边进行维修技术的传授，修好了机器，又培养了机修人员。在秦师傅夜以继日的苦干下，公社十多部排灌机械修理任务提前十天完成了。临别时，公社举行了欢送会，秦师傅代表工厂接受了公社赠送的红旗。（闽辑）
