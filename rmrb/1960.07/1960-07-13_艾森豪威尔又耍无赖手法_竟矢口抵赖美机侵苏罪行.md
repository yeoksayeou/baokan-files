Xinhua News Agency, July 12th, Washington dispatch: After maintaining nearly two days of silence and conducting a series of emergency consultations among senior government officials, U.S. President Eisenhower, at his vacation headquarters in Rhode Island, today issued a statement on the incident of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft again intruding into Soviet airspace and being shot down, categorically denying the U.S.'s aggressive crimes.

The statement described the Soviet Union's just action of shooting down the invading U.S. aircraft and defending its national airspace as a "deliberate and reckless attempt to create an international incident." The statement, read by White House Press Secretary Hagerty, categorically denied the U.S.'s aggressive crimes, insisting that the aircraft "never flew over Soviet territory, territorial waters, or airspace."

The statement was apparently still shaken by the U.S. U-2 spy plane being shot down and the strong opposition from people all over the world to the exposure of the U.S. aggressive conspiracy, so it said that "there is no basis for linking the flight of this aircraft with the flight of U-2 aircraft."

Prior to this, Assistant Secretary of Defense Snyder had come forward to try his best to deny the U.S.'s aggressive crimes. He insisted that the U.S. "RB-47" reconnaissance bomber shot down by the Soviet Union on July 1st did not "deliberately intend to fly over the Soviet Union" and was not performing military missions over the Soviet Union. Another U.S. Department of Defense spokesman attempted to conceal the matter, saying that changes in "the Earth's magnetic force" "sometimes cause magnetic compasses to show unreliable readings," causing the aircraft to deviate from its course. He also repeated the clumsy lie that had long been debunked, insisting that the aircraft was "mapping the climate" over international waters north of Russia.

After the incident was revealed, the "New York Times" worriedly wanted the U.S. government to learn a lesson and handle this new aircraft incident with "the prudence to avoid making confusing statements."

### 艾森豪威尔又耍无赖手法　竟矢口抵赖美机侵苏罪行

　　艾森豪威尔又耍无赖手法
　　竟矢口抵赖美机侵苏罪行
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：在保持了将近两天的沉默，并在政府高级官员之间进行了一连串紧急商谈以后，美国总统艾森豪威尔在罗得岛的休假总部今天就美国军用侦察飞机再次侵犯苏联领空而被击落的事件发表声明，矢口抵赖美国的侵略罪行。
    这份声明把苏联击落美国入侵飞机、保卫国家领空的正义行动，说成是“制造国际事端的故意而轻率的企图”。由白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂宣读的这项声明矢口抵赖美国的侵略罪行，硬说这架飞机“从未在苏联领土、领海或领空飞行”。
    声明显然对美国U—2间谍飞机被击落和美国侵略阴谋大暴露而遭到全世界人民的强烈反对一事犹有余悸，因而它说什么“把这一飞机的飞行同U—2飞机的飞行联系起来是没有根据的”。
    在这以前，国防部助理部长斯奈德曾出面竭力抵赖美国的侵略罪行。他硬说，1日被苏联击落的美国“RB—47型”侦察轰炸机并没有
  “故意想要在苏联上空飞行”，也不是在苏联上空执行军事任务。另一名美国国防部发言人则企图掩饰，说什么“地球的磁力”的变化“有时候会使磁罗盘呈现不可靠的刻度”，使飞机离开它的航线。他还重弹早已破产的笨拙的谎言，硬说这架飞机是在俄国以北的公海上空“绘制气候图”。
    事件揭露后，“纽约时报”忧心忡忡地要美国政府接受教训，“以避免发表使人混乱的声明的谨慎态度”来处理这一新的飞机事件。
