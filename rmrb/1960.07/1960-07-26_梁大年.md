    ·Our Newspaper Reporter·
    Opening the door to the office of Liang Danian, deputy manager and Party committee member of the Lanzhou Municipal Engineering Company, it is empty. The curtains are drawn, and a thin layer of dust settles on the desks, chairs, and sofas. The master is not at his desk. The orderly, Xiao Ma, complains, "It's always like this in his room! You can fill a thermos with boiling water, and after three days, it's still full! Most of the time, you only see light coming from the window of this office late at night..."
    Since the rectification movement in 1957, people in the company have rarely found their deputy manager in the office. In the past three years, Liang Danian has spent most of his time on the front lines of production, except for attending meetings and studying in the company. This new type of leadership style has brought a series of fruitful results. As Liang Danian said, "As leaders, only by frequently going deep into reality can we avoid subjectivism in the rapidly developing situation, and only then can we discover the constantly emerging new situations, new problems, and new experiences!"
    Going to the Site for Investigation and Research
    The West Linyin Avenue, which connects Lanzhou to the new industrial area of Xigu, can no longer meet the increasingly frequent traffic demands. The Municipal Engineering Company received the task of widening it. This project alone requires over 700,000 cubic meters of backfill. The construction site is bordered by a mountain to the south and the Yellow River to the north, making it a challenging project.
    After the construction team arrived at the site, a problem arose. Originally, there was a railway line in the narrow space between the mountain and the river. To extract soil, a scaffolding had to be built over the railway, which was uneconomical and unsafe, greatly limiting the progress of soil extraction. Liang Danian discovered this problem after arriving at the construction site. What to do? He sought advice and solutions from the workers. One worker jokingly said, "The Yellow River is the closest, but what if the Dragon King doesn't give us soil?" Unexpectedly, this unintentional remark gave the deputy manager great inspiration. The next day, he crossed the river, climbed mountains and hills, and after three consecutive reconnaissance missions, he finally proposed a new construction plan: extract soil from the Yellow River!
    The boldness and novelty of this plan were unexpected, but it was reasonable and feasible. According to Liang Danian's investigation, only a few small dams need to be built on the Yellow River tributary upstream of the construction site to force the Yellow River to vacate a large area of riverbed, making it a very convenient place to extract soil. This not only ensured the safety and progress of the construction but also reduced the project cost by 400,000 yuan due to labor savings. An added benefit was that the riverbed after soil extraction could be easily converted into a good fish farm with a little renovation.
    The filling and widening project of West Linyin Avenue was completed ahead of schedule, and Liang Danian's plan was fully realized.
    In the process of going deep into production practice in recent years, Liang Danian has discovered and solved problems that could not be solved while sitting in the office. This is not unique, and it is not even the most important. The riverbank project of the Lanzhou Binhe Road and the river port wharf, which was basically completed not long ago, was originally designed to build a stone embankment five meters wide and more than ten meters high. During the construction process, Liang Danian went deep into the four construction sites along the route, specifically observed the construction site, consulted the historical data of the Yellow River water level, compared the old embankment project, checked the design data, and widely solicited the opinions of workers and technicians. Based on this investigation and research, he suggested raising the foundation elevation of the riverbank project and changing the embankment to a revetment. This suggestion saved a total of 35,000 cubic meters of masonry work, saving the state nearly one million yuan in investment.
    Squatting Down to Focus on Weak Links
    Breaking through weak links by "dissecting a sparrow" and using a point to lead the surface is another characteristic of Liang Danian's deep dive into reality.
    Another key municipal construction project in Lanzhou, which is under construction, has not been progressing well since its start. The key problem is that 450,000 cubic meters of earthwork cannot be transported out. At that time, the earthwork volume of the projects undertaken by the Municipal Company was generally very large. Liang Danian was determined to "squat" at this construction site to specifically study where the problem was and see if he could find the key to a high-speed leap forward in the company's earthwork projects.
    After arriving at the construction site at the end of May, he first started with investigation and research, conducted a baseline survey of the workforce, inspected the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and analyzed a week's worth of original production records. At this time, he found that the plan issued by the company was not practical. According to the statistical reports, the construction site had 540 employees, but in addition to management cadres, repair workers, raw material production workers, odd-job workers, cooks, personnel supporting other units, etc., only 374 people were officially engaged in earthwork production. Even if these people completed two and a half times their quotas, they would not be able to achieve the task assigned by the company. At his suggestion, the plan was revised. The revised target was still aggressive. In order to better complete this plan, he widely visited the workers, carefully studied the site, and, together with the site负责人, formulated measures such as fast loading and unloading of earthwork, improving construction organization procedures, and vigorously promoting small-scale blasting, which made the construction take a turn for the better. However, the fundamental problem - earth transportation - had not been completely resolved. After pondering hard, Liang Danian concluded that the only way out was tool reform!
    These days, when he rides his bicycle through the streets, he constantly observes the trailer trucks walking on the street. These trucks lengthen and enlarge the original carriage, and add a turntable on the beam to make the steering flexible. According to different models, the transportation efficiency can be increased from one to ten times. He thought, why can't the hand carts used to transport earth on the construction site be modified in this way? He discussed this idea with the construction site cadres and veteran workers and started experimenting. Originally, a cart could pull 300 catties, but now the improved vehicle can pull about 600 catties, increasing efficiency by one time.
    Unfortunately, many workers were unwilling to use this new type of vehicle after it appeared.
    Liang Danian was puzzled. He went to ask the workers whether the new car was good or not? The workers said: almost! Pull more, walk slower! He thought that more wheels than fewer wheels would reduce the holding force, it should be lighter; and the situation of popularizing the situation on cars and horse-drawn carriages also proved to be a successful experience, why can't people pull carts? That day, he took off his shirt and personally did a comparison test with Chen Wanbang, deputy secretary of the company's party committee. They loaded soil with new and old cars on the construction site, and pulled them to their destination along a 2.5-kilometer road. Although the two were exhausted and sweaty, they finally found the shortcomings. Although the new car carries more weight, the front of the car presses down, making it very difficult to pull. After repeated research on the spot, they found that the position of the turntable was too far forward and the center of gravity was inaccurate. After improvement, the weight was greatly reduced. The workers tried it and said, this is simply equal to a small horse-drawn carriage!
    Liang Danian finally found the key to the high speed of earthwork transportation in production practice. Through the on-site meeting, this experience has been widely promoted in various construction sites, and more than 600 frame cars owned by the company are being modified.
    A Leader, Friend, and Student
    Liang Danian is also famous for his diligent political studies. When he travels to and from construction sites, he always fills his bag with books, documents, newspaper editorials and experience articles that he has cut out, and he takes them out to read whenever he has time, with circles and dense notes on every page. He is particularly good at learning from the masses and from practice, which makes his theoretical knowledge more profound and richer, thereby further improving his leadership level. Liang Danian calls the knowledge he learns from the workers "living knowledge." Once, an old worker was digging river pebbles, and he was more efficient than others. An investigation revealed that he knew how to "read the water." Reading the water means finding the gaps between the stones based on the arrangement direction of the alluvial stones in the river, which can double the work efficiency. This incident taught him a lesson that when digging soil, breaking stones, and demolishing city walls, they should also be demolished according to the original structure of the object. His learning, summarizing, supporting, and helping of new things and advanced experiences generated among the masses has become the main content of his leadership work that he often thinks about.
    People who don't know Liang Danian can hardly see that he is a company manager. He wears a set of old cloth clothes and a pair of cloth shoes. No matter where he is, he sits on the ground and talks with the workers. When he is at the construction site, he always goes to the workers' dormitories and canteens to understand the situation and solve life problems. Not long ago, a construction site added more than 1,000 workers, and there were not enough bed boards temporarily, so he personally went to the warehouse to check. He found that a large number of birch wood poles were stored in the warehouse, so he mobilized everyone to use these poles to make bed frames, and used grass ropes to connect them in the middle. This elastic grass rope bed is economical and practical, and the workers are very satisfied and praise it as a "more, faster, better, and more economical" bed.
    This simple, approachable, and close-knit mass style of work has earned Liang Danian the love of the workers, who regard him as a confidant and are willing to discuss things with him and talk without restraint. There is such a thing: one morning when the sky was already dawning, the night shift workers were about to get off work, and someone suddenly found a person sleeping in the underground oil pipe being installed. "Who is this?" a new worker asked strangely. The squad leader looked forward and exclaimed, "It's Deputy Manager Liang!" He thought for a while and gestured to everyone, whispering, "Don't wake him up! He hasn't slept for several days, let him rest here for a while!" A worker immediately took off his cotton coat and gently covered the deputy manager...

    梁大年
    ·本报记者·
    打开兰州市政工程公司副经理、党委委员梁大年办公室的门，里面空荡荡的，窗帘低垂，桌椅和沙发上落着薄薄的一层尘土。主人不在他的办公桌旁。勤务员小马抱怨说：“他屋里老是这样！灌上一暖壶开水，过上三天，还是满满的一壶！多半在深夜，才能看见这间办公室的窗口透出灯光……”
    1957年整风运动以后，公司里的人很少在办公室里找到他们的副经理。三年来，梁大年除在公司开会和学习以外，绝大部分时间都是在生产第一线。这种新型的领导作风，已带来一系列丰硕的收获。正如梁大年所说的：“作为领导者，只有经常地深入实际，才能在飞跃发展的形势中避免主观主义，才能发现经常不断出现的新情况、新问题和新经验！”
    到现场去调查研究
    兰州市通往新工业区西固的西林荫大道，已不能适应日益频繁的交通要求，市政工程公司接到了拓宽任务。这项工程仅回填土方就有七十万立方米以上。施工现场南是土山，北是黄河，这是一项艰巨的工程。
    施工队伍到达现场以后，问题发生了。原来在山与河的夹同里，还有一条铁路，要取土必须在越过铁道的上空搭架，这既不经济又不安全，大大限制了取土的进度。梁大年到工地以后发现了这个问题。怎么办？他向工人群众求谋问计。一个工人开玩笑地说：“要论近嘛，黄河最近。但龙王爷不给土怎么办？”谁知这句无心的话却给副经理很大的启示。第二天，他就渡河翻山爬坡，经过连续三次侦察，最后竟提出一个新的施工方案：从黄河取土！
    这个方案的大胆和新鲜，非常出人意料，但却是合理可行的。根据梁大年的调查，只须在施工现场上游的黄河支流上，筑起几道小型拦河坝，就会逼使黄河腾出大片河床，成为非常方便的取土场所。这不仅保证了施工的安全和进度，而且由于节省人工，可以降低工程造价四十万元。附带还有一个好处是，取土后的河床，稍加修葺就是一个很好的养鱼场。
    西林荫大道的填土拓宽工程，提前完工了，梁大年提出的方案全部实现了。
    梁大年几年来在深入生产实际的过程中，发现和解决的这种坐在办公室里无法解决的问题，这并不是唯一的，甚至也不是最重要的。不久前基本完工的兰州滨河路和河港码头的河岸工程，原设计为修砌宽五米高十几米的砌石河堤。在施工过程中，梁大年深入沿线四个工地，具体观察了施工现场，查阅了黄河水位的历史资料，比较了旧堤工程，核对了设计数据，广泛征求了工人和技术人员的意见，在这种调查研究的基础上，他建议提高河岸工程基础标高，并将河堤改为护坡。这个建议共计节约三万五千方砌石工程，为国家节省投资近一百万元。
    蹲下来大抓薄弱环节
    通过“解剖麻雀”突破薄弱环节，以点带面，是梁大年深入实际中的另一特色。
    正在修建中的另一个兰州市重点市政建设工程，开工以来，完成计划的情况不够好，关键问题是四十五万立方米土方运不出去。当时，市政公司承建的工程中，一般土方量都很大。梁大年决心在这个工地“蹲点”，具体研究一下毛病到底在什么地方，看能不能找到使全公司土方工程来个高速跃进的钥匙。
    在5月底到达这个工地以后，他首先从调查研究入手，对职工队伍作了摸底排队，检查了技术革新与技术革命运动的开展情况，分析了一个星期的生产原始记录。这时，他发现公司下达的计划是不切合实际的。从统计报表看，工地拥有五百四十名职工，但除了管理干部、修配工、原材料生产工、杂工、炊事员、支援其它单位人员等等以外，正式投入土方生产的只有三百七十四人，这些人即使完成两倍半的定额，也实现不了公司下达的任务。经过他的提议，修改了这个计划。修改后的指标仍然是积极的。为了更好地完成这项计划，他广泛地访问了工人群众，仔细研究了现场，和工地负责人一起拟订了快装快卸多拉土方、改进施工组织程序、大力推广小型爆破等措施，使施工有了起色。然而根本问题——运土仍未得到彻底解决。梁大年苦苦思索以后，结论是出路只能是工具改革！
    这些天，当他骑着自行车经过大街时，他不断观察在街上行走的拖挂汽车，这种车将原来的车厢加长加大，在大梁上增一转盘使转向灵活，根据不同车型可分别提高运输效率一倍到十倍。他想，为什么不能把工地上运土的人拉车也这样改装呢？他把这个想法同工地干部和老工人商量后，开始试验。原来一辆车能拉三百斤，现在改进后的车辆能拉六百斤左右，效率提高了一倍。
    事情真正不巧，这种新型的车辆出现后，许多工人都不愿意用。
    梁大年不解。他去问工人新车到底好不好？工人们说：差不离！拉得多些走得慢些！他想多轮比少轮减少了扶力，应该是轻些；而且在汽车和马车上推广的情况证明也是一项成功经验，为什么人拉车就不行？当天，他就脱去上衣和公司党委副书记陈万邦亲自作对比试验。他们在工地分别用新车和旧车装上土，沿着两公里半的道路拉向目的地。两个人虽然累得满头大汗，但到底发现了缺点，新车虽然载重多，但车头向下压，拉时很吃力。当场经过反复研究，他们发现，原来是转盘位置太靠前，重心不准。经过改进，果然重量大大减轻。工人们试了试，都说，这简直等于一辆小马车！
    梁大年在生产实践中终于找到了土方运输高速度的关键。通过现场会议，这项经验已在各个工地普遍推广，公司拥有的六百多辆架子车都在进行改装。
    是领导又是朋友和学生
    梁大年也是以勤奋进行政治学习闻名的。在他来往工地的时候，总是在皮包里塞满了书籍、文件、剪下来的报纸社论和经验文章，有空就拿出来读，每一页上都是圈点密批。他特别善于向群众学习，向实践学习，这使得他的理论知识更加深刻丰富起来，从而更进一步提高了领导水平。梁大年把向工人群众学得的知识称做“活的知识”。一次，一个老工人在挖河卵石，他比别人效率高。一调查，原来他会“看水性”。看水性，就是根据河流冲积石头的排列方向，找石与石之间的缝口挖，这样可提高工效一倍。这件事却使他学到了一个道理，在挖土、砸石、拆城墙时，也应该按物体原有结构进行拆除。他对群众中产生的新生事物和先进经验的学习、总结、支持和帮助，已成为他领导工作经常思考的主要内容了。
    不认识梁大年的人，很少能看出他是一位公司经理，一套旧布衣、一双布鞋，不论什么地方就地一坐便和工人们交谈起来。他在工地时总是经常到工人宿舍和食堂去，了解情况、解决生活上的问题。不久前有一个工地新增了一千多名工人，暂时床板不足，他就亲自到库房查看，发现库房存有一大批桦木杠子，他就发动大家用这种杠子作床框，中间用草绳串联起来。这种富有弹性的草绳床，经济适用，工人们非常满意，称赞它为“多快好省”床。
    这种淳朴的平易近人的密切联系群众的作风，使梁大年获得工人群众的爱戴，把他当作知心朋友，有事情愿意找他商量，毫不拘束地无话不谈。有这样一件事：在一个天已微明的清晨，夜班工人就要下班，有人忽然发现正在安装的地下油污管中，睡着一个人。“这是谁呀？”一个新来的工人奇怪地问。小队长向前看了看，就惊叫起来：“是梁副经理！”他想了一下就向大家打了一个手势，悄声说：“不要吵醒他！他已经连续几天没有睡觉了，就让他在这里休息一会儿吧！”一个工人立刻把自己身上的棉衣脱下来，轻轻地给副经理盖上去……
