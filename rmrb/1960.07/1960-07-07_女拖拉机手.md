Female Tractor Driver

The tractor of the Ma Guanglin Tractor Station has already set out, a long dragon moving across the commune's fields, like bursts of spring thunder transmitting to all directions. See how heroic the female tractor driver is! See how heroic the female tractor driver is, with bright eyes and chest held high, skillful hands controlling the steering wheel, headscarf flying, face full of spring breeze. Headscarf flying, face full of spring breeze, driving the galloping iron horse adorned with a red mane; the ploughshare lifts up waves of black, the entire land is trembling slightly! The entire land is trembling slightly, strips of field foundations are submerged in the waves; the black waves stretch to the horizon, the commune's fields are vast and boundless! The commune's fields are vast and boundless, the deeply ploughed soil is soft and loose, the black, oil-rich earth, ah, whirls up gusts of fragrant wind. Whirling up gusts of fragrant wind, the hearts of the commune members are warm, each one jumping happily on the waves, singing and sowing seeds. Singing and sowing seeds, each one wearing a joyful smile,
"Thanks to the warm assistance of the worker brothers, we hold this year's bumper harvest in our hands!"
"We hold this year's bumper harvest in our hands, and we are even more grateful to our young female hero!"
Clusters of kapok are thrown towards the girl, the girl's face is as red as the kapok. The girl's face is as red as the kapok, raising her hand high to greet the peasant brothers:
"All the station workers wish the commune a great harvest; worker-peasant brothers work together for the merit of socialism..."

    女拖拉机手
    马光琳机耕站的拖拉机已经出动，公社田园里游动一条长龙，像阵阵春雷向四野传送，请看女拖拉机手多么英雄！请看女拖拉机手多么英雄，两目炯炯挺着前胸，灵巧的手把驾驶盘操纵，头巾翻飞，满脸春风。头巾翻飞，满脸春风，驾着奔驰的铁马飘动红鬃；犁铧掀起黑色的波浪，整片土地都在微微抖动！整片土地都在微微抖动，条条田基淹没在波浪之中；黑色的波浪向天边伸展，公社的田园辽阔无穷！公社的田园辽阔无穷，深翻的泥土又软又松，乌黑得要冒油的土地呵，旋起一阵阵的香风。旋起一阵阵的香风，社员的心中暖融融，一个个在波浪上欢跳，一边歌唱，一边播种。一边歌唱，一边播种，个个挂着喜悦的笑容，
  “多靠工人大哥热情援助，今年丰收操在我们手中！”
  “今年丰收操在我们手中，更感谢我们年青的女英雄！”
  一朵朵木棉向姑娘抛撒，姑娘脸儿像木棉一样鲜红。姑娘脸儿像木棉一样鲜红，高高扬手招呼农民弟兄：
  “全站工人预祝公社大丰收；工农兄弟共为社会主义立功……”
