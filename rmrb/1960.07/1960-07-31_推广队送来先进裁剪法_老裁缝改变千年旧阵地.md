Two national clothing industry advanced tailoring method promotion teams, jointly formed by the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the China Light Industry Trade Union, promoted advanced tailoring experience in eighteen cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, and Chengdu, from May 17 to July 12. The two teams gave a total of more than two hundred and seventy performances in eighteen cities, promoting and summarizing more than two hundred experiences.

The main feature of the advanced tailoring methods promoted this time is tight arrangement and careful calculation, so that clothing materials can be fully and rationally utilized. This advanced tailoring experience is highly valued by the clothing industry in various places, and its promotion is very effective. Many employees said it is like "sowing at Yin time, sprouting at Mao time, blooming at Chen time, and bearing fruit at Si time." At present, major clothing factories or sewing shops in the cities where the promotion team has been, have adopted this advanced tailoring method. After learning the new tailoring method, the Guiyang Provincial Handicraft Cooperative Clothing Factory improved the layout method of raincoats, and the products increased by 10% without increasing the raw materials. The Guiyang Nanming District Clothing Factory was originally the most material-saving unit in the city, using only one zhang three chi two cun of cloth to make a Zhongshan suit, but after adopting the new tailoring method, it was reduced from one zhang three to one zhang two. One hundred and twenty tailoring workers in Chengdu's Dongcheng District used the new tailoring method to rush-produce more than a thousand pieces of clothing in one night, saving more than two thousand chi of cloth.

The vast number of consumers also welcome this new tailoring method. Clothes made with the new tailoring method are quickly sold out as soon as they are put on the market. Consumers happily said that it saves both cloth and money, it really is finding gold under the scissors.

    推广队送来先进裁剪法  老裁缝改变千年旧阵地
    由轻工业部、商业部、中国轻工业工会联合组成的两个全国服装行业先进裁剪法推广队，于5月17日到7月12日分别在上海、南京、西安、成都等十八个城市推广先进裁剪经验。两个队在十八个城市共作了二百七十多场表演，推广和总结了二百多项经验。
    这次推广的先进裁剪法的主要特点是紧密安排、精打细算，使衣料得到充分合理的利用。这种先进裁剪经验，很受各地服装行业的重视，而且推广起来见效很快。许多职工说它是“寅时播种，卯时发芽，辰时开花，巳时结瓜”。目前在推广队所到城市的各大服装工厂或缝纫门市部，都采用了这种先进裁剪方法。贵州省手工业联社服装厂，学习了新裁剪法后，改进了雨衣的排料方法，不增加原料，产品却增加了10％。贵阳南明区服装厂原来是全市用材料最节省的单位，做一套中山服只用一丈三尺二寸布，但是采用了新裁剪法，又从一丈三降低到一丈二。成都市东城区一百二十名裁剪工人采用新裁剪法，在一个晚上赶制一千多件衣服，节省了二千多尺布。
    广大消费者也非常欢迎这种新裁剪法。用新裁剪法作出的衣服一拿到市场，很快就销售一空。消费者高兴地说，又省布又省钱，真是剪刀底下出黄金。
