Xinhua News Agency Report: Under the guidance of the principle of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way," various regions have universally carried out intercropping of grain in forests to make full use of all available land. They have also used intercropping to cultivate the large areas of young forests planted since last winter and this spring, consolidating the afforestation results. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces and regions, including Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou, the area of intercropping grain in forests (mainly young forest land) has reached more than 50 million mu to date.

Since the beginning of this year, various regions have summarized and promoted the experience of intercropping grain in forests over the past few years. They have generally regarded intercropping grain in forests as an important measure for the high-speed and comprehensive development of agricultural and forestry production in mountainous and forest areas, setting off a large-scale upsurge. In mountainous areas of Guizhou Province, people's communes widely promoted intercropping grain in forests, planting more than 15 million mu of crops such as corn, millet, potatoes, beans, vegetables, and fodder crops in young forest land this spring. In Hunan Province, people's communes fully utilized the large areas of young forest land newly planted since last winter and this spring, vigorously engaged in intercropping grain in forests. By early July, they had intercropped more than 10 million mu of various agricultural crops, an increase of more than two times the total area of intercropping grain in forests for the entire last year. Provinces and regions such as Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Zhejiang have also seen a significant increase in the area of intercropping grain in forests this year compared to previous years.

Intercropping grain in forests not only makes full and rational use of large areas of forest land that have not yet been closed, but also cultivates young forests by planting grain, cash crops, etc. in the forest land, weeding out weeds, loosening the soil, increasing fertilizer, and conserving water. This improves the survival rate of young forests and accelerates the growth of trees. In Hunan Province, due to the vigorous promotion of intercropping grain in forests in recent years, forty-nine mountainous counties in the province have changed from grain-deficient to self-sufficient or surplus. The Weixing (Satellite) Forest Farm of Yuecheng Commune in Defeng County, Guangdong Province, while carrying out large-scale tree planting and afforestation this spring, also vigorously engaged in interplanting coarse grains in forest land, planting a total of 1,278 mu of various coarse grains. Currently, the 35 mu of early-planted "gang he" (mountain rice) are about to mature. The 1,100 mu of cassava are also growing very vigorously. The average survival rate of young forests in the intercropped land reached 97%. The 1,850 mu of Chinese fir planted achieved full seedling emergence and grew particularly fast. The Chinese fir planted last spring has now reached a height of two to two and a half "shi chi" (Chinese feet), which is more than one "shi chi" higher than the Chinese fir planted at the same time nearby that did not have intercropping. Last year, Xiahu Commune in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, planted crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and soybeans in more than 6,500 mu of young Chinese fir and oil-tea camellia forest land and tea gardens. They intercropped more than 1,000 mu of vegetables in near-mountain and low-mountain forest land, which not only increased income, but also made the forest trees in the intercropped land grow particularly well. Tea production increased by more than 30%, and oil-tea camellia production increased by 10-20%. This year, Zhejiang Province has universally promoted last year's experience. Since the beginning of spring, intercropping grain in forests has been widely carried out in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Currently, the oil-tea camellia is growing very well and is bearing abundant fruit. The grain and various cash crops in the forest are growing vigorously, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

Intercropping grain in forests is a good way to support forestry with agriculture, use short-term gains to nurture long-term growth, and combine long-term and immediate interests. Farmers in Jiufeng Commune in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, summarized five major benefits of intercropping grain in forests: First, it can make full use of forest land, rapidly increase grain production, and increase agricultural income. Second, it can improve the survival rate of young forests and promote their rapid growth, and it is also conducive to water and soil conservation and changes in soil aggregate structure, which is beneficial to tree growth. Third, it requires less labor and yields greater benefits. Fourth, it increases feed production, which is beneficial to the development of animal husbandry. Fifth, it clears the forest farm, which is conducive to eliminating forest pests and preventing forest fires. Due to the vigorous promotion of intercropping grain in forests, some mountainous and forest areas in Jiangsu, Hunan, Henan, Guizhou, and other provinces have changed the past situation of single forestry production, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have been fully developed, and the economic landscape has undergone great changes.

    高速度发展农林生产  幼林区大搞林粮间作
    据新华社讯　各地在“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针指导下，为了充分利用一切可以利用的土地，普遍开展了林粮间作，并且通过林粮间作对去冬今春以来所造大面积幼林进行了抚育，巩固造林成果。据河北、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、山东、安徽、浙江、福建、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、四川、贵州等十七个省区截至目前的不完全统计，林（主要是幼林地）粮间作的面积已有五千多万亩。
    今年以来，各地总结并推广了几年以来林粮间作的经验，普遍把林粮间作当作山区和林区高速度、全面的发展农林生产的一项重要措施，掀起了一个大规模林粮间作高潮。贵州省山区各地人民公社广泛推行林粮间作，今春在幼林地里大种玉米、谷子、薯类、豆类、蔬菜、饲料等作物一千五百多万亩。湖南省各地人民公社充分利用去冬今春以来新造大面积幼林地，大搞林粮间作，到7月上旬已经间作各种农作物一千多万亩，比去年全年林粮间作总面积还增长了两倍多。河南、广东、广西、山西、四川、浙江等省区，今年林粮间作的面积也都比往年有了较大的增加。
    林粮间作，不仅能使大面积尚未郁闭的林地得到充分而合理的利用，同时通过在林地中种植粮食和经济等作物，锄掉了林间杂草，疏松了土壤，增肥保水，从而抚育了幼林，提高了幼林的成活率，加速了林木的生长。湖南省几年来由于大力推广林粮间作，全省已经有四十九个山区县由过去缺粮变成了自给或有余。广东省德封县悦城公社卫星林场，今春在开展大规模植树造林的同时，大搞林地间种杂粮，全场共种下各种杂粮一千二百七十八亩。目前，早种的三十五亩岗禾（即山稻子）即将成熟。一千一百亩木薯也生长得十分茁壮。林粮间作地的幼林成活率平均达到97％。营造的一千八百五十亩杉树达到了全苗，而且长得特别快。去春定植的杉树，到现在树高已达二市尺至二点五市尺，比附近同期定植但没有进行林粮间种的杉树高出一市尺多。浙江省开化县霞湖公社去年在六千五百多亩杉木、油茶幼林地和茶园中种了玉米、甘薯、黄豆等作物，在近山和低山林地中套种了一千多亩蔬菜，不仅增加了收入，间作林地的林木也生长特别好，茶叶增产30％以上，油茶增产10—20％。今年浙江省普遍推广了去年的经验，入春以来，在山区和半山区广泛的进行林粮间作，目前油茶长的很好，结果累累，林间的粮食和各种经济作物生长茁壮，丰收在望。
    林粮间作，是以农养林、以短养长、把长远利益和眼前利益结合起来的好办法。广东省乐昌县九峰公社的农民总结出林粮间作有五大好处：第一，能够充分利用林地，迅速增产粮食，增加农业收入。第二，能提高幼林的成活率和促进幼林快速生长，并且有利于水土保持和改变土壤团粒结构，因而有利于林木生长。第三，花工少、收益大。第四，增产饲料，有利于畜牧业发展。第五，清理了林场，有利于消灭林木虫害和杜绝山火。江苏、湖南、河南、贵州等的部分山区和林区，由于大搞林粮间作，改变了过去单一林业生产的局面，农、林、牧、副、渔业得到全面发展，经济面貌有了很大的改变。
