Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The Chinese-Iraqi Friendship Association held a reception this evening to warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Iraq.

Iraqi Ambassador to China, Fadhel, embassy personnel, and Iraqi students studying in Beijing were invited to attend the reception.

Luo Jun, Vice President of the Chinese-Iraqi Friendship Association, spoke at the reception. He warmly congratulated the Republic of Iraq on its second National Day and wished the Republic of Iraq prosperity and strength, and its people happiness. In his speech, Luo Jun pointed out that the experience of the Iraqi revolution proves that the seemingly powerful imperialism and its running dogs are most afraid of the people's awakening. As long as the people unite and take active action to resolutely fight against imperialism and its running dogs, no force can stop their progress.

Luo Jun said, "We believe that, based on the spirit of the July 14th Revolution, the Iraqi people will unite more closely to safeguard national independence, oppose imperialist aggression, defend world peace, and achieve greater success in building their own country."

Referring to the friendly relations between the Chinese and Iraqi peoples, Luo Jun pointed out that these relations are developing day by day.

Ambassador Fadhel warmly praised the friendship between the Iraqi and Chinese peoples in his speech.

He said that today's celebration reception shows the friendly relations between the Iraqi and Chinese peoples, which would not have been possible before the Iraqi revolution.

Ambassador Fadhel said that the Iraqi people have long struggled against imperialism, feudalism, and corrupt regimes. The success of the Iraqi revolution has contributed to the cause of world peace. He proposed a toast to the friendship between the Iraqi and Chinese peoples, to the great achievements of the Chinese people, and to world peace.

Among those attending the reception were Ding Xilin, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; He Ying, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Zhou Erfu, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association; Sa Kongliao, a director of the Chinese-Iraqi Friendship Association in Beijing; and people who have visited Iraq.
