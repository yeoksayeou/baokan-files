Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd. More than one million workers on the industrial, transportation, and commercial fronts in Henan Province are doing their best to vigorously support agricultural production and the current drought resistance movement. While ensuring the completion of national production plans and commodity circulation plans, factories are stepping up the production and repair of water lifting equipment, centered on irrigation and drainage machinery, to arm the drought resistance army from all aspects.

By mid-June, the province had completed 5,040 units of irrigation and drainage power machinery, with more than 125,000 horsepower, exceeding the national plan for the first half of the year by 78.19%; produced more than 195,000 various waterwheels, exceeding the national plan by 90.95%; produced more than 75,800 sets of various "rocket cones," nine times more than the annual national plan; and produced more than 8,700 agricultural water pumps, and repaired tens of thousands of water conservancy tools. In addition, irrigation and drainage rubber tubes, transmission belts, and other products have also completed the national production plan for the first half of the year far ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. The transportation department transported 1.47 million tons of drought resistance materials; the postal and telecommunications departments actively added service organizations, adjusted business hours and shifts, and served the needs of drought resistance with methods such as telephones, newspapers, magazines, and mail "reaching the fields"; the commercial front tried every possible means to ensure the supply of drought resistance and other agricultural production materials.

Since the beginning of this year, factories and mines in Henan Province have deeply implemented the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry vigorously supporting agriculture. Therefore, when the drought appeared this year, the factories and mines, while firmly grasping the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, launched a large-scale overproduction movement to protect drought resistance with steel, protect steel with coal and ore, and protect coal with transportation. As a result of vigorously grasping steel overproduction to protect drought resistance, as of June 20, the province had provided 1,735 tons of steel and 156,124 tons of pig iron from steel overproduction for the manufacture and repair of irrigation and drainage power and water conservancy construction, which strongly supported the drought resistance struggle and created favorable conditions for the province to achieve water conservancy as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, Electric. The Jiangsu mechanical industry system implements the policy of agriculture as the foundation of national economic development, and industry must vigorously support agriculture, and in the spirit of "giving priority to other provinces before our own" and the national overall situation, this year it has transferred 190,000 horsepower of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery and equipment to various parts of the country, which is twice as much as last year. The vast majority of the province's annual external transfer task stipulated by the state has been completed, and it has been done in a timely, complete, qualified, and quantitative manner, which strongly supports agricultural production in fraternal provinces and regions.

The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels continuously educate the vast number of workers in the mechanical industry system to support agriculture. When organizing production and arranging plans, they always move ahead rather than lag behind, and at the same time, they grasp both manufacturing and complete sets of factory shipments. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the principle of giving priority to the state before the local area, and giving priority to other provinces before our own, they actively complete the external transfer plan. For Henan, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces with severe drought, they tried every possible means to transfer and transport them as soon as possible. At present, Jiangsu is continuing to earnestly implement the spirit of the national overall situation, and is working hard to complete the finishing work of complete set delivery, and is inspecting the quality of products.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Universities in the capital are actively mobilizing manpower and material resources to vigorously support agriculture. Since this spring, universities and colleges have established regular contacts and comprehensive cooperative relations with people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing.

Teachers and students of higher engineering colleges actively participate in agricultural technical transformation. Together with the peasants, they start from scratch, combine indigenous and foreign methods, use local materials, adapt to local conditions, and vigorously develop commune-run industries that serve agricultural production, design and manufacture mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and repair equipment. Since April this year, Beijing Mining College has organized more than 1,000 teachers, students and workers from the machinery, electrical machinery, geology and other departments to go to four communes in Changping County and the state-owned fishing farm in Yanqing County in the suburbs to assist the communes in building two foundry workshops and one machinery repair shop from scratch, and participate with the commune members in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In Changping County alone, they have realized 75 technical innovations and 114 pieces of equipment such as shearing machines, pedal lathes, and cold hammers; nearly 1,000 pieces of tool repair and simple machinery manufacturing. Tsinghua University students are assisting Yongfeng People's Commune in building an agricultural machinery repair shop that can repair 100 combined tractors and produce 1,000 agricultural machines every year. Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College has helped people's communes in Changping, Huairou and other counties design and manufacture more than 60 kinds of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, 13 of which have been applied to agricultural production.

Teachers and students of agricultural science and science departments go deep into the fields to learn and summarize the experience of old farmers, and conduct scientific research centered on increasing production. Beijing Agricultural University, focusing on the "Eight-Character Constitution" for high yields of five major field crops such as wheat, rice, cotton, corn, and sweet potatoes, organizes teachers and students from various majors such as agronomy, soil chemistry, physiological biochemistry, meteorology, and plant protection to conduct comprehensive research in complete sets, and conduct detailed and in-depth investigations and experiments on a variety of high-yield measures. The teachers and students who were sent to Daxing County, under the leadership of the local Party Committee, are working with the peasants to experiment with changing barren saline-alkali land into rich rice paddies. Teachers and students who go deep into Shahe People's Commune, according to the spirit of the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture, combine intensive cultivation and high mechanization to carry out research on the comprehensive innovation of the cultivation system. Students of the Chemistry Department of Peking University helped the commune build a new chemical laboratory, and used local methods to trial-produce potassium rock fertilizer, which is low in cost and very popular among farmers; the commune has established a new furnace and is preparing to produce it in batches immediately.

Universities in the capital are adopting a variety of methods to cultivate technical forces for rural people's communes in a faster, better and more economical way. More than 100 commune Party secretaries and chairmen from 27 provinces and cities across the country are studying in the People's Commune Management Training Class run by Beijing Agricultural University. Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College has opened two training classes for machine management and agricultural machinery repair. Eighty-five commune members from people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing have studied related theories and operating skills such as tractors, animal husbandry machinery, water conservancy machinery, and agricultural machinery repair for more than three months. After graduation, these students have returned to their respective communes to serve as tractor team leaders and agricultural technicians. In addition, some university teachers and students formed new technology promotion teams and went to the countryside to run small training classes while making new technologies blossom and bear fruit locally. Beijing Agricultural University has established training classes for local methods of producing chlortetracycline and antibiotics in nearby people's communes. Some university teachers and students, while helping the communes develop commune-run industries, build factories and train personnel at the same time. When the factory is built, technical cadres from peasant backgrounds also grow up in batches.

Whenever it is busy farming season, teachers and students from universities in Beijing enthusiastically go to the communes to participate in labor. In the second half of June, nearly 20,000 university students in Beijing went to the suburbs and other people's communes to support wheat harvesting, and completed 100,000 workdays in just over ten days.

The fixed-point connection and long-term cooperation between universities in the capital and rural people's communes not only supports agricultural production, but also plays a significant role in strengthening the connection between theory and practice and improving teaching. (Attached picture)

    本报郑州3日电　河南省工业交通和商业战线上的一百多万职工，各尽所能大力支援农业生产，支援当前的抗旱运动。各厂在保证完成国家生产计划和商品流转计划的同时，加紧大造大修以排灌机械为中心的提水机具，从多方面武装抗旱大军。
    截至6月中旬为止，全省已完成排灌动力机械五千零四十台和十二万五千多马力，超额78.19％完成了上半年国家计划；生产各种水车十九万五千部，超过国家计划90.95％；生产各种“火箭锥”七万五千八百套，比全年国家计划多九倍；生产农业用水泵八千七百多台，并修配了成千上万的水利工具。另外，排灌胶管、传动带等产品，也都大大提前超额完成了上半年国家生产计划。交通部门运输抗旱物资一百四十七万吨；邮电部门积极增设服务机构，调整营业时间和班次，并以电话、报刊、邮件等“十到田”的办法，服务于抗旱的需要；商业战线千方百计保证了抗旱和其它农业生产物资的供应。
    今年以来，河南省各厂矿由于深入地贯彻了发展国民经济以农业为基础，工业大力支援农业的方针，因此，当今年旱象一出现，各厂矿就在紧抓上半年完成全年计划一半的同时，展开了以钢铁保抗旱，以煤炭、矿石保钢铁，以交通保煤炭的大超产运动。由于大抓钢铁超产保抗旱的结果，到6月20日止，全省从钢铁超产中提供排灌动力制造、修配和水利建设用的钢材达一千七百三十五吨，生铁十五万六千一百二十四吨，有力地支援了抗旱斗争，同时，为全省尽快实现水利化创造了有利条件。
    据新华社南京电　江苏机械工业系统贯彻执行农业是国民经济发展的基础，工业要大力支援农业的方针，并本着“先省外，后省内”的全国一盘棋精神，今年已调运全国各地的农业排灌机械设备十九万马力，比去年多了两倍，已完成国家规定的全省全年外调任务的绝大部分，并做到及时、成套、按质、按量，有力地支援兄弟省区的农业生产。
    中共江苏省委和各级党委，不断地向机械工业系统广大职工进行支援农业的教育。在组织生产、安排计划时，都赶前不赶后，同时既抓制造，又抓成套出厂。各厂根据省委指示，按照先国家、后地方，先省外后省内的原则，积极完成外调计划。对旱象严重的河南、河北、山东等省，则千方百计地尽先提前调运。目前，江苏各地正在继续认真贯彻全国一盘棋精神，狠抓成套交货扫尾工作，并对产品质量进行检查。
    据新华社2日讯　首都高等学校积极动员人力物力，各尽所能，大力支援农业。今春以来，各高等院校已纷纷同北京郊区各人民公社建立经常的联系和全面的协作关系。
    各高等工科院校师生积极参加农业技术改造。他们同农民一道，白手起家，土洋结合，就地取材，因地制宜，大力发展为农业生产服务的社办工业，设计和制造机械化、半机械化农具，检修设备。北京矿业学院今年4月份以来，组织机械、机电、地质等系一千多名师生和工人，分赴郊区昌平县的四个公社和延庆县国营渔场等地，协助公社白手起家地兴建起两个铸工车间、一座机械修配厂，并且同社员一起参加技术革新和技术革命运动。仅仅在昌平县，他们就实现了剪铁机、脚踏车床和冷锤等技术革新七十五项一百一十四件；工具检修及简易机械制造等近千件。清华大学学生正在协助永丰人民公社建设一个每年能修配一百台混合拖拉机、生产一千架农业机具的农业机械修配厂。北京农业机械化学院帮助昌平、怀柔等县的人民公社设计制造了六十多种机械化、半机械化农具，其中的十三种已经应用于农业生产。
    农科、理科院系的师生深入田间，学习和总结老农的经验，以增产为中心进行科学研究。北京农业大学围绕小麦、水稻、棉花、玉米、白薯等五种主要大田作物丰产的“八字宪法”，组织农学、土壤化学、生理生化、气象、植物保护等各专业的师生进行配套成龙的综合研究，细致深入的调查研究和试验多项丰产措施。下放到大兴县的师生，在当地党委领导下，正在和农民一起试验将贫瘠的盐碱地改变为富饶的水稻田。深入沙河人民公社的师生，根据农业“八字宪法”的精神，提高精耕细作和高度机械化结合起来，进行耕作制度全盘革新的研究。北京大学化学系学生帮助公社新建化验站，用土法试制成钾岩化肥，成本较低，很受农民欢迎；公社已建立新炉，准备立即成批生产。
    首都高等学校正采取多种多样的办法，多快好省地为农村人民公社培养技术力量。北京农业大学开办的人民公社经营管理训练班，有全国二十七个省市的公社党委书记、社长共一百多人正在学习。北京农业机械化学院开设了机务管理和农业机械修理两个训练班，来自京郊人民公社的八十五名社员，在三个多月中分别学习了拖拉机、畜牧机械、水利机械、农业机器修理等有关理论和操作技能。这批学员结业后已分别回到各公社担任拖拉机队长和农业技术人员。此外，一些高等学校的师生组成了新技术推广队，到农村去一边开办小型的训练班，一边使新技术在当地开花结果。北京农业大学在附近人民公社设立了土法生产土霉素、抗菌素训练班。有的学校师生在帮助公社发展社办工业的过程中，边建厂、边培训人员，工厂建成的时候，农民出身的技术干部也成批成长起来。
    每逢农忙季节，北京各高等学校师生都热情地到公社参加劳动。6月下半月，北京有近两万名高等学校师生到郊区和外地人民公社支援麦收，在短短十多天内，共做了十万个劳动日。
    首都高等学校和农村人民公社定点挂钩、长期协作，不仅支援了农业生产，对加强理论和实际的联系，改进教学，也起了很大的作用。（附图片）
