Eagle in the Storm
By our reporters and correspondents in Guangdong

    During the days when wind, rain, floods, and tides struck the Shantou area, the soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Guangdong rushed to the forefront of disaster relief and bravely defended the lives and property of the people. Their moving deeds in fighting the disaster are being fondly spread among the people.

    “Chairman Mao’s divine eagle is here!”

    On June 11, a plane led by squadron leader Huang Xuchun pierced through the clouds and entered the airspace over Chenghai. After the pilot discovered the airdrop target on the banks of the Han River, with one turn, the two doors on the left and right sides of the cabin opened simultaneously, and six airdrop personnel vigorously threw down large bundles of sacks, dropping more than 1,000 kilograms of sacks in just fifteen minutes. Then came the second plane, the third plane…

    “Here it comes, Chairman Mao’s divine eagle is here!”

    The laborers on both sides of the Han River in Chenghai cheered and rushed to the airdrop point. Earlier, everyone was so anxious because the flood peak level of the Han River had broken the highest record in history since last night, reaching 16.88 meters. If it were in previous years, both sides of the Han River would have been a vast expanse of water. But today, although the east and west dikes still stand tall, dangerous situations have arisen everywhere. Sacks, what is urgently needed is sacks! At this critical moment, the motherland’s divine eagle flew in and airdropped 30,000 sacks in less than half a day. How could this not make everyone ecstatic! When everyone opened the large bundles of sacks, ah, how wonderful! “Specification – First Class. Packaging Date – June 10, 1960.” All of them were manufactured yesterday. What excited the laborers even more was that they found a large bundle of the day’s Southern Daily newspaper among the sacks. Opening the newspaper, the headline news reported that the Provincial Party Secretary had personally arrived at the flood control front, greatly boosting the morale of the laborers. Poor peasant Chen Qisheng carried a bundle of sacks weighing two to three hundred catties and ran swiftly to the dangerous section.

    In recent days, planes have been constantly flying east, flying east. One plane, fully loaded with fried rice and biscuits rushed out overnight by workers, residents, and office cadres in Guangzhou, set off for the Shuikou Commune in Xingning County. In order to quickly and accurately deliver the grain to the disaster victims, the Air Force pilots racked their brains beforehand, repeatedly studied the flight route map and airdrop location, and finally decided not to fly according to the original route, but to open up the nearest route. When the plane flew over Shuikou, after the pilot found the target, he found that the left and front of the target were puddles and paddy fields, which were not conducive to airdrops. They chose a big mountain on the right side of the target as the airdrop point. As soon as the bell rang, bags of dry food were dropped from the cabin, landing right on the designated mountain.

    The masses in the Shuikou Commune, seeing the green military aircraft circling in the air, happily raised their hands, some waving towels at the plane, shouts of "Long live the Communist Party!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" intertwined with applause. The plane flew so low and dropped so accurately that everyone praised the pilot's skills. When the commune members opened the dropped grain bags and saw that it was fried rice, they all said happily: "With the Communist Party, we are not afraid of anything."

    Water Human Bridge

    In Puning County, most of the villages in the Gongshan Brigade of the Hongyang Commune were flooded, and many people climbed onto roofs and treetops to escape. After accepting the rescue mission, the soldiers of a model company of a certain unit rode in small boats or swam into the village. They saw that the houses in the village were half-submerged in water and could not be entered from the door, so they climbed onto the roof, pierced the roof tiles, and entered the house to rescue people. In some places, the water was chest-deep, and the rescued people could not walk across. Instructor Xie Yingxiang directed the soldiers to divide into two rows, facing each other, with their hands clasped together, forming a human bridge, allowing the people to walk over it, completely escaping from the flood.

    The moving story of the "water human bridge" also appeared in the rolling turbid currents of the lower reaches of the Han River. Jiangdong Commune in Chao'an County is in the heart of the Han River. When the flood peak broke the highest record in history, many villages were flooded. The soldiers drove rubber boats against the wind and currents to rescue the victims. In order to safely get the masses out of the houses, the soldiers wore life jackets, floated in the water, and carried wooden boards on their shoulders to build a human bridge, allowing the masses to walk on their bodies. The wind and flood became more and more fierce. The soldiers stayed motionless in the water for a long time, shivering from the cold, but they said: "In order to save the villagers from disaster, the people's soldiers will never bow to difficulties!" They persevered arduously. At this time, Zhang Baoshan, the company commander of a certain company, heard that a woman who had just given birth could not move, so he immediately took some soldiers to rush there, found a threshing bucket, added bedding, comfortably placed the mother and child in the bucket, carefully lifted it onto the boat, so that the mother and child, like all the victims, safely escaped from danger.

    Exploring the Hidden River

    The Han River flood was rising sharply, and hidden dangers continued to appear in the Xiabuqiao dike section - hidden rat holes would suddenly shoot out columns of water like fountains. At this moment, seventeen sailors from a naval unit arrived in time. Seeing these dangerous situations, they temporarily formed a diving team to take on the task of exploration and rescue. However, the flood control headquarters did not have diving equipment. The only two indigenous methods of security and disaster relief equipment the sailors got were bamboo poles and rice straw. They inserted long bamboo poles into the river and held them tightly. The divers carried rice straw and dived along the bamboo poles into the depths of the flood to block the holes.

    In the flood, seventeen sailors rose and sank alternately, exchanging breaths. Many people, when they surfaced, were splashed with a few mouthfuls of floodwater by the oncoming waves if they were not careful. After some exploration, diver Du Zishou found a big hole, but he couldn't plug it tightly after several attempts with his hands. Later, he hugged a large bundle of rice straw and dived down, using his feet to push the rice straw into the hole. Unexpectedly, as soon as he pushed it in, his leg was sucked in and couldn't be pulled out. The breath he had taken from the surface could no longer hold out, and he felt very uncomfortable. Just as he was in danger of suffocating, the soldiers on the shore saw that he hadn't surfaced for a long time, and rushed into the water to rescue him, bringing him ashore.

    The treacherous flood did not scare the heroic sailors. They dived into the deepest part of the flood again and again. However, the buoyancy of the flood was too great, and the human body was like a floating leaf, always unable to sink, and involuntarily being pushed up. The sailors decided to use the method of people pressing on people to press people to the depths. Captain Lin Shenjun was the first to take on this experiment. He asked the big man Chen Xiankun to stand on his shoulders and push him down hard. When he fell to the bottom of the water more than two people deep, he felt the pressure of the water was very high, his ears hurt, his nose was sore, and his heart seemed to jump out of his throat. Lin Shenjun endured this discomfort, surfacing and sinking every minute, and spent a total of one and a half hours to plug a rat hole.

    The sailors fought hard in shifts for three days and three nights, and finally eliminated the hidden dangers and protected the embankment.

    暴风雨中的雄鹰
    本报驻广东记者和通讯员集体采写
    在风、雨、洪、潮袭击汕头专区的日子里，中国人民解放军驻广东地区的陆、海、空军战士，纷纷奔赴抗灾抢险的最前线，英勇地保卫了人民的生命财产。他们同灾害作斗争的动人事迹，被人们亲切地传诵着。
    “毛主席的神鹰来啦！”
    6月11日，由中队长黄绪春带领的飞机，穿云驾雾，进入澄海上空。飞行员发现了韩江畔的空投目标后，一个盘旋，机舱左右的两扇门便同时敞开，六个空投人员使劲地投下大捆大捆麻袋，不过十五分钟，便投下了麻袋一千多公斤。接着第二架，第三架……。
    “来啦，毛主席的神鹰来啦！”
    澄海韩江两岸的民工们雀跃欢呼，拔腿向空投点奔去。先前，大家多么心焦啊，韩江的洪峰水位，从昨晚起，便突破了记载史的最高纪录，达到十六点八八米了。假使是在往年，韩江两岸早已是汪洋泽国。而今天，虽然东西两堤仍巍然屹立，但是已经险情四起。麻袋，急需要的是麻袋！在这十万火急的当儿，祖国的神鹰飞来了，不到半天时间，空投了三万个麻袋，这怎能不使大家欣喜若狂哩！大家把大捆大捆麻袋解开一看，嗳，多么好啊！“规格——一等。包装日期——1960年6月10日。”统统都是昨天出厂的哩。更令民工们兴奋的是，在麻袋当中还发现一大捆当天的南方日报，掀开报纸一看，头条新闻刊载省委书记亲临抗洪前线的消息，大大鼓舞了民工们的斗志。贫农陈启声，一揽子托起二、三百斤重的麻袋，拔脚飞奔，送到险段上。
    这几天来，飞机不断地飞往东方，飞往东方。一架飞机满载着广州职工、居民、机关干部通宵赶制出来的炒米、饼干，往兴宁县的水口公社进发。空军飞行员们为了迅速、准确地把粮食送到灾民手里，事前便绞尽脑汁，反复研究了航线图和空投位置，最后确定了不按原来航线飞行，而新辟了最近的航线。飞机飞临水口，飞行员找到了目标之后，发现目标的左边和前面都是水洼地和水田，不利于空投。他们便选择了目标右边的一个大山头作为空投点。铃声一响，一包包干粮从机舱投下去，正好落在预定的山头上。
    在水口公社的群众，看到空中盘旋着的绿色军用飞机，都高兴地举着双手，有的拿着手巾向飞机挥舞着，“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声和鼓掌声交织在一起。飞机飞得那么低，投得那么准确，大家都称赞飞行员的本领。当社员们打开了投下的粮食袋时，看到是炒熟了的米，都高兴地说：“有了共产党，什么都不怕了。”
    水中人桥
    在普宁县，洪阳公社贡山大队的村庄大都被淹掉了，许多群众都爬上屋顶、树梢躲避。某部队的一个模范连的战士，接受了抢救任务之后，便乘着小船或泅水冲进村里。他们看到村里的房子被水淹了一半高，不能从门口进去，便爬上屋顶，凿穿瓦盖，入屋抢救。有些地方水深齐胸，被救出来的群众不能走过，连指导员谢英祥指挥着战士分成两行，面对着面，手扣着手，搭成人桥，让老百姓在上面走过去，全部脱离了洪灾困境。
    “水中人桥”的感人事例，也出现在韩江下游的滚滚浊流中。潮安县的江东公社在韩江的江心，当洪峰突破历史最高纪录时，许多村庄都受淹了，战士们顶风逆流地驾驶着橡皮艇抢救灾民。为了把群众从屋子里安全地接出来，战士们身穿救生衣，漂浮在水中，肩扛木板，搭成人桥，让群众从身上走过。狂风洪流越来越猛，战士们长时间一动不动地浸在水中，冷得发抖，但是他们说：“为挽救乡亲脱离灾难，人民战士绝不向困难低头！”他们艰苦地坚持着。这时，某连连长张宝山听说有个刚分娩的妇女不能走动，便立即带一些战士赶到，找了个打谷桶来，又加垫了被褥，把母子舒适地安置到桶里，小心翼翼地抬上船，使母子俩和全体灾民一样，都安全地脱离险境。
    潜江探险
    韩江洪流在急剧上涨，下埔桥堤段不断出现险患——隐藏的鼠洞，会突然像喷泉一样激射出水柱来。正在这时，海军某部的十七个水兵及时赶到，他们看到这些险情，便临时组成了潜水队，担当探险抢险工作。但是防汛指挥所没有潜水器材设备，水兵拿到用以保安和抢险的只有两件土法宝——竹竿和稻草。他们便将长竹竿插进江里，紧紧撑住，潜水员带着稻草，沿着竹竿潜到洪涛深处堵塞漏洞。
    在洪流中，十七个水兵此起彼落地浮上沉下，换吸空气。许多人在露出水面时，稍不留神，就被迎面扑来的浪头呛了几口洪水。潜水员杜子寿经过一番探索，才找到了大漏洞，但用手堵了几次，都没有塞紧。后来他抱一大捆稻草潜下去，用脚把稻草往洞里蹬，谁料一蹬进去，这条腿就被吸住了，拔不出来。他从水面吸的那口气已支持不下去了，憋得十分难受。正陷入被窒息危险的时候，岸上的战士见他久久冒不上来，赶忙下水抢救，才把他带上岸来。
    险恶的洪水，并没有吓倒英雄的水兵。他们三番四次地往洪水最深的江底潜下去。可是洪流的浮力太大，人体好像一片浮叶似的，总是沉不下去，身不由己地一个劲地被顶上来。水兵们决定用人压人的办法，把人压到深处去。队长林深俊第一个担负这个试验，他让大个子陈贤坤站在自己的肩上，使劲地往下沉。当他坠到两人多深的水底时，便觉得水的压力很大，耳朵疼痛，鼻子发酸，心脏像要从喉咙里跳出来似的。林深俊耐着这种难受，每隔一分钟便冒上、沉下，前后竟用了一个半钟头才把一个鼠洞堵住。
    水兵们这样轮班苦战了三天三夜，终于清除了隐患，保住了堤围。
