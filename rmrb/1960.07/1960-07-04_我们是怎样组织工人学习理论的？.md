How Do We Organize Workers to Study Theory?
The Chinese Communist Party's Hankou Battery Factory Committee

In July 1958, based on the great victories achieved in the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, our factory began to organize workers to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. At that time, all employees of the factory recognized that in order to manage production well and achieve a great leap forward, they should not only study culture and technology, but also study and master Marxist-Leninist theory. They said, "How can we improve if we don't study theory? Without studying, our ability to participate in management will not be great either." Therefore, the number of people participating in theoretical study quickly reached more than 95% of the total number of factory employees. For the past two years, learning has been persisted in, and the number of people participating in learning has consistently remained at around 95%. Why can it develop so persistently and deeply? Based on the experience of the past two years, we have the following insights:

Connecting Theory with Practice, Learning for Application

When we first organized workers to study theory in 1958, the first question we encountered was: What to study? How to study? After repeated research, it was decided to try the method of learning what is done and applying what is learned. At that time, a vigorous labor competition was being carried out throughout the factory, and some workers did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between the individual and the country. Some advanced workers were unwilling to approach backward workers, considering them to be "hopelessly backward." Advanced groups also did not want backward workers. Backward workers also had opinions about some activists, thinking that they looked down on them. In response to these situations, the Party committee decided to organize everyone to first study the relationship between advanced and backward, and how to correctly handle contradictions of two different natures. During the discussion, comrades from the pasting group raised the question: Why are there advanced and backward elements? Why can the advanced and backward transform into each other? What is the nature of the contradiction between those who violate labor discipline and us? This aroused a heated debate among everyone. Through study, everyone realized that advanced and backward are a unity of opposites, and the opposing sides can transform into each other under certain conditions. This contradiction belongs to the people and should be resolved through persuasion, education, and assistance. After this debate, workers who were originally unwilling to approach backward workers changed their attitudes and actively helped their backward comrades. Backward workers also made up their minds to get rid of their "burdens" and catch up with the advanced. A competition climax of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward quickly formed throughout the factory. As a result, workers' interest in learning became even higher. They said, "After studying, our horizons have broadened, and our understanding of problems has deepened." Cadres also realized that organizing workers to study theory makes political and ideological work more in-depth and solid.

For more than a year, we have consistently adhered to serving politics, serving production, and serving the central task, starting from the domestic and international situation, the factory's production status, and the ideological trends of the workers and masses, and organizing workers to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the Party's lines, guidelines, and policies in a targeted manner. For example, during the Great Leap Forward in steel production in October 1958, our factory's small blast furnace won the honorary title of Red Flag Furnace from the municipal headquarters. However, several battery production products did not complete their tasks well, and some people said, "It is not very appropriate for the battery factory to make steel," and "Drawing people out to make steel has an impact on production." In response to this situation, we organized employees to study and discuss issues such as "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," "Taking Steel as the Key Link, Achieving an All-Round Leap Forward," "The Unity of Opposites in Contradictions," and "The Principal Contradiction and the Principal Aspect of a Contradiction," so that the masses realized the great significance of the Great Leap Forward in steel production, established the ambition to strive for a double harvest of steel and production, and promoted the over-fulfillment of the factory's production tasks, winning the honorary title of Red Flag Unit from the municipal headquarters. In the first quarter of 1959, the Party called on us to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution. At that time, some employees believed that:
  "The battery factory produces chemical products, and chemical formulas are not easy to innovate," "Machine operation cannot be innovated," and "To achieve high quality, we cannot achieve high output," and so on. In response to these ideas, we organized employees to study the theory of continuous revolution and repeatedly studied the essence of the general line, so that the masses further liberated their minds, raised their awareness, and greatly promoted the development of the movement. From August to the end of 1959, in connection with the general line education movement, we organized employees to study the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the "Three Magic Weapons," the relationship between nine fingers and one finger, so that the masses theoretically distinguished between right and wrong, improved their understanding of the "Three Magic Weapons" of socialist construction, and thus more firmly established the proletarian stance and the firm concept of listening to the Party's words. Since this year, we have been talking to employees about the current situation and organizing everyone to study issues such as "Setting High Ambitions and Lofty Aspirations," "Continuous Revolution," "The High Speed and Proportionate Development of Socialist Construction,"
  "Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution," and "Industry Supporting Agriculture," studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works "The Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain" and the editor's note of the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky," so that in the storm of technological innovation and technological revolution, all new conservative ideas were swept away, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was encouraged. Facts have proved that organizing the broad masses of workers to study theory in this way can achieve immediate results, greatly promote the improvement of the political and ideological consciousness and working ability of the workers, promote the development of technological innovation and technological revolution, and promote the Great Leap Forward in production.

To implement the principle of linking theory with practice, we must have flexible and diverse learning methods. For the learning of the broad masses of workers, we generally adopt the method of lecturing first and then discussing. Sometimes, in order to make it easier for workers to understand a theoretical point of view, we also adopt the method of first conducting debates on practical issues, and then explaining the different viewpoints in the debate. In lecturing, we always pay attention to fully utilizing specific materials to make the lectures lively and convincing. In learning, we also adopt the methods of "Five Sides" (learning, applying, speaking, writing, and performing), "Four Greats" (great airing of views, great debates, great-character posters), and "Three Mores" (more thinking, more asking, and more looking). We not only emphasize learning to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide practice and solve practical problems in our own thinking, work, production, and daily life, but also advocate that workers and the masses write articles extensively. In the past year or so, all employees of the factory have written a total of 4,860 articles and poems, of which 85 have been published in Party newspapers and magazines.

Mutual Teaching and Learning, Those Who Are Able Can Be Teachers

After workers' theoretical study developed into a factory-wide mass movement, we urgently felt that if we did not cultivate a team of theoretical backbones from among the workers, we would not be able to solve the problem of teachers for lecturing and tutoring workers, nor would we be able to develop the learning movement in depth and sustainably. In October 1958, we held an amateur worker-lecturer training class to vigorously train worker teachers. Now, the factory has 101 worker theory teachers (of which 73 have the ability to lecture), with an average of one teacher for every fifteen workers. This group of worker theory teachers began lecturing in December 1958, and by March 1959, they were responsible for all the lecturing tasks in the factory. Under the unified leadership of the Party branch, they formed teaching and research groups to collect and analyze workers' ideological trends, prepare lessons, lecture, and provide learning guidance, forming a broad teacher network throughout the factory. The first problem encountered in training worker teachers is still to break superstitions. When workers become teachers, they generally have "three fears" at the beginning: First, they are afraid that their cultural level is low and they cannot lecture well; second, they are afraid that their theoretical level is low and they will make mistakes; third, they are afraid that they are not articulate and cannot speak in front of the masses. Some workers also said:
  "Worker teachers have not studied much more than me, and now they are starting to lecture, isn't that just nonsense!" On the one hand, we mobilized and encouraged worker teachers to dare to lecture, and at the same time, we focused on training worker teachers such as Cheng Yifu and Chen Zhongxu to take the stage to lecture first. Because they are most familiar with the production, workers' ideological situation, and existing problems in their workshops, and they are well prepared, they not only lecture logically and orderly, but also have good connections with reality, and they use the language that workers are most familiar with, lecturing vividly and lively, so they are deeply welcomed by the masses and fully demonstrate the superiority of worker teachers. The first shot was fired, "One person took the stage, and hundreds followed," worker teachers were full of confidence, and they began to step onto the podium to lecture one after another. Workers felt that being a teacher was no longer mysterious. They said, "Philosophy is not mysterious, workers can learn, and to attend a lecturer class, you just need to work hard." For the training of worker teachers, in addition to holding amateur training classes, the important method is to learn and teach at the same time, and to improve through lecturing. We adopt the form of teaching and research office and teaching and research group, with the Party committee members, full-time teachers, or college students, and worker theory teachers combined to help worker teachers prepare lessons and jointly study the main content of each lecture. Worker teachers who are just starting to lecture generally transmit, that is, they first listen to the lecture, and then return to the workshop to transmit the lecture in connection with the specific situation. After several lecturing exercises, they adopt the method of semi-transmission, where the worker teacher independently organizes materials and writes a lecture draft based on the lecture outline drafted by the teaching and research office. Worker teachers with a certain ability to prepare lessons basically prepare lessons independently, that is, they formulate an outline and write a lecture draft based on the main content proposed by the teaching and research office. This method of learning and teaching at the same time is a good way to train worker teachers at high speed. Worker teachers said, "Preparing lessons is the greatest help to us and improves the fastest," and "The lessons I have lectured on are thoroughly learned, deeply impressed, and remembered firmly."

In addition to combining with the central work and combining with lesson preparation and lecturing to learn, worker teachers must also systematically study some basic theoretical knowledge. Our factory's first phase of worker lecturer training class systematically lectured on "Learning Dialectics and Applying Dialectics," "Understanding Contradictions and Solving Contradictions," "The Relationship between Knowledge and Practice," "Productive Forces and Production Relations," and "Walking on Two Legs" and other nineteen topics on dialectical materialism and historical materialism, using "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as basic teaching materials. Since January 1959, in addition to writing lecture drafts, worker teachers have also written 885 articles. They said, "Writing articles is really good, and after writing about a problem, I think about it much more deeply." We also take the method of appropriately reducing the general meeting activities of worker teachers, so that they have two to four hours more study time per week than the workers, and in fact, most worker teachers carry books with them and read them whenever they have time. Before and after meetings, after meals, and during breaks are their precious study time. Comrade Ding Chuqiao, a worker teacher, no matter how busy he is at work, reads books for at least a few tens of minutes before going to bed every night. In the past year, he has finished reading the first and second volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and has read "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" seven or eight times.

Strengthen Party Leadership and Launch a Mass Movement

Can workers' theoretical study launch a mass movement? Our factory's practice for more than a year has given an affirmative answer. Our experience is that: the secretary taking the lead, boldly mobilizing the masses, constantly sweeping away ideological obstacles, and supporting the masses' enthusiasm for learning are important conditions for promoting this learning movement. At the beginning of the learning movement, we organized all workers who were willing to learn according to the principle of voluntariness. When we encountered various ideological obstacles and difficult problems in the process of carrying out the learning movement, the Party committee secretary personally took charge to quickly solve these problems. At the same time, the Party committee also adopted the method of cultivating typical examples and setting examples to drive the masses. For the tendency of some leading cadres to neglect workers' theoretical study, in addition to organizing debates on whether workers can learn theory at the beginning of the movement, we usually use the methods of conversation and discussion to solve the problem, or the Party committee propaganda minister introduces the workers' learning situation to these comrades, so that they understand that workers are learning theory very well, and thus pay attention to it.

Strengthening the Party's specific leadership is the primary guarantee for the learning movement to be carried out vigorously and thoroughly. Not long after the learning movement was launched, the Party committee established a factory-wide learning leading group, with the leading comrades of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League as the main members, with the Party committee secretary as the leader, to regularly check and study the implementation of the teaching policy of combining theory with practice, and to frequently give instructions on major issues such as the content of learning and the training of workers' learning backbones, strengthening the specific leadership of the learning movement. Under the learning leading group, a factory-wide teaching and research office is set up, composed of an excellent worker teacher sent by each workshop, and specifically led by the Party committee propaganda department, responsible for studying the specific content of learning and lecturing in various periods and training worker teachers. Under the leadership of the Party branch, each workshop sets up a teaching and research group, composed of worker teachers, and the Party branch sends a branch committee member to personally lead. In order to break the workers' sense of mystery about theory, the Party committee secretary and the chairman of the labor union and other leading comrades also frequently lectured to the workers and studied and discussed with the workers. In the past two years, a total of 28 Party and Youth League branch secretaries, workshop directors, and labor union chairmen from the entire factory have participated in the worker teaching and research office and teaching and research group activities, accounting for 52% of the total number of leading cadres above the deputy section level in the factory. Leading cadres learning with workers not only strengthened the guidance of learning, but also promoted the cadres to go deep into the masses and go deep into production, further strengthening the relationship between the cadres and the worker masses.

Studying Marxism-Leninism, studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and arming the minds of workers with Mao Zedong Thought is a political task of utmost importance. The achievements made by our factory workers in studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong in the past two years have demonstrated the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. "Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength," this is a learning experience that everyone in our factory has been passing on. We are determined to further strengthen and improve the leadership of this learning movement, so that the movement develops to a deeper and higher stage.

    我们是怎样组织工人学习理论的？
    中共汉口电池厂委员会
    1958年7月，在整风运动和反右派斗争取得伟大胜利的基础上，我厂开始组织工人学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志的著作。当时全厂职工认识到要管理好生产，实现大跃进，不仅要学习文化、技术，还要学习和掌握马克思列宁主义理论。他们说：“我们不学习理论怎么能提高？不学习，参加管理的本领也不大。”因此，参加理论学习的人很快就达全厂职工总数的95％以上。两年来，学习一直坚持了下来，参加学习的人数经常保持在95％左右。为什么能这样持久深入地发展呢？根据两年来的实践，我们有以下几点体会。
    联系实际学以致用
    1958年我们开始组织工人学习理论时，首先碰到的一个问题是：学什么？如何学？经过反复研究后，决定采用做啥学啥、边学边用的办法先试一试。当时全厂正在开展轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，有些工人对个人与国家的关系没有明确的认识。有些先进工人不愿接近后进工人，认为他们是“死落后”。先进小组也不想要后进工人。后进工人对一些积极分子也有意见，认为他们瞧不起自己。针对这些情况，党委决定组织大家先学习先进与落后的关系、如何正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾等几课。在讨论时，糊化小组的同志提出：为什么有先进有后进？为什么先进与落后可以相互转化？违犯劳动纪律的人与我们是什么性质的矛盾？引起了大家热烈的辩论。通过学习，大家认识到先进与落后是矛盾的对立统一，对立的双方在一定的条件下可以相互转化。这种矛盾属于人民内部的矛盾，应该用说服教育和帮助的方法来解决。经过这一场辩论，原来不愿接近后进的工人改变了态度，主动帮助后进的同志；后进工人也下决心丢掉“包袱”，赶上先进。全厂迅速形成了学先进，赶先进，帮后进的竞赛高潮。这样一来，工人的学习兴趣更高了，他们说：“学习后眼界宽广了，看问题深刻了。”干部也认识到组织工人学习理论，使政治思想工作更加深入扎实了。
    一年多来，我们一直坚持了为政治、为生产、为中心工作服务，从国内外形势、工厂生产状况、职工群众思想动向出发，有的放矢地组织工人学习毛泽东同志的著作、学习党的路线、方针、政策的办法。例如1958年10月大炼钢铁时，我厂小高炉曾夺得市指挥部给予的红旗炉的光荣称号，但在电池生产上有几种产品完成任务不够好，有人就说：“电池厂炼钢铁不太合适”，抽人出去炼钢铁对生产就是有影响”。针对这种情况，我们组织职工学习和讨论了“全国一盘棋”、“以钢为纲，全面跃进”、“矛盾的对立统一”、“主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面”等问题，使群众认识了大炼钢铁的伟大意义，树立了力争钢铁、生产双丰收的雄心，促进了全厂生产任务的超额完成，获得了市指挥部给予的红旗单位的光荣称号。1959年第一季度，党号召我们大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，当时有一部分职工认为：
  “电池厂生产化学性的产品，化学配方不好搞革新”，“机器操作不能搞革新”，“要优质就不能高产”等等。针对这些思想，我们组织职工学习了不断革命论，并反复学习了总路线的精神实质，使群众进一步解放了思想，提高了认识，大大推动了运动的开展。1959年8月到年底，结合总路线教育运动，我们组织职工学习了党的八届八中全会决议、“三大法宝”、九个指头和一个指头的关系，使群众从理论上划清了大是大非的界线，提高了对社会主义建设“三大法宝”的认识，因而更加坚定了无产阶级立场，树立了要听党的话的牢固观念。今年以来，我们又在职工中大讲当前形势，组织大家学习“树雄心、立大志”、“不断革命”、“社会主义建设的高速度和按比例”、
  “技术革新和技术革命”、“工业支援农业”等问题，学习毛泽东同志的著作“愚公移山”和“谁说鸡毛不能上天”一文的按语等文件，从而在技术革新和技术革命的风暴中，横扫了一切新的保守思想，鼓舞了群众的革命干劲。事实证明，用这种方法组织广大工人群众学理论，能收到立竿见影的效果，大大促进了工人群众政治思想觉悟和工作能力的提高，促进了技术革新和技术革命的发展，促进了生产的大跃进。
    贯彻理论联系实际的方针，必须有灵活多样的学习方法。对于广大工人群众的学习，我们一般采用先讲课后讨论的方法。有时为了使工人更易于理解一个理论观点，也采用先就实际问题开展辩论，然后针对辩论中的分歧观点进行讲解。在讲课时，始终注意充分利用具体材料，使课讲的生动，有说服力。在学习中我们还采用“五边”（边学、边用、边讲、边写、边演）、“四大”（大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报）、“三多”（多想、多问、多看）的方法。我们不但强调要学会运用毛泽东思想来指导实践，解决自己在思想、工作、生产和日常生活中的实际问题，还提倡职工群众大写文章。一年多来，全厂职工共写了文章、诗歌四千八百六十篇，其中在党的报刊、杂志上发表的有八十五篇。
    互教互学　能者为师
    工人学理论发展成为全厂性的群众运动后，我们迫切感到如果不从工人中培养一支理论骨干队伍，既不能解决向工人讲课、辅导学习的师资问题，也不能使学习运动深入持久地发展。1958年10月我们就举办了业余工人讲师训练班，大力培养工人教员。现在全厂有工人理论教员一百零一人（其中具有讲课能力的七十三人）平均每十五名工人中就有一个教员。这批工人理论教员，从1958年12月起开始讲课，到1959年3月就担负了厂内的全部讲课任务。他们在党支部统一领导下，成立教研小组，搜集和分析研究工人的思想动向，进行备课、讲课和学习辅导等活动，在全厂形成了一个广泛的教师网。培养工人教员首先碰到的问题，仍然是要破除迷信。工人当教员，开始时一般有“三怕”：一怕文化低，讲不好；二怕理论低，讲错了；三怕嘴巴笨，在群众面前讲不出话。有的工人也说：
  “工人教员比我多学不了几天，现在就讲起课来了，那还不是瞎扯！”我们一方面动员、鼓励工人教员大胆去讲，同时重点培养了工人教员程义富、陈忠旭等同志首先登台讲课。由于他们最熟悉本车间的生产、工人思想情况及存在的问题，加上准备充分，不仅讲得有条有理，而且联系实际好，又是用工人最熟悉的语言，讲的生动活泼，因而深受群众欢迎，充分显示了工人教员的优越性。第一炮打响了，“一人上了台，百人跟上来”，工人教员信心百倍，纷纷开始登上讲坛讲课。工人们感到当教员也不神秘了，他们说：“哲学不神秘，工人能学习，要上讲师班，只要肯努力”。对于工人教员的培养，除举办业余训练班外，重要的办法是边学边教，通过讲课来锻炼提高。我们采用教研室、教研组的形式由党委委员、专职教员或大专学校的学生、工人理论教员三结合，帮助工人教员备课，共同研究每次讲课的主要内容。刚开始讲课的工人教员一般是传授，即先听课，然后回车间结合具体情况传授讲课。经过几次讲课锻炼后，则采用半传授的办法，由工人教员根据教研室拟定的讲课提纲，自己独立组织材料，写出讲稿。有一定备课能力的工人教员，基本上是独立备课，即根据教研室提出的主要内容，自己拟提纲，写讲稿。这种边学边教的办法，是高速度地培养工人教员的好办法。工人教员说：“备课对我们的帮助最大，提高最快”，“自己讲过的课学得透，印象深，记得牢”。
    工人教员除了结合中心工作，结合备课、讲课进行学习外，还必须比较系统地学习一些基本理论知识。我厂第一期工人讲师训练班，就以《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》为基本教材，系统地讲授了“学习辩证法、运用辩证法”、“认识矛盾，解决矛盾”、“认识与实践的关系”、“生产力与生产关系”、“两条腿走路”等关于辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的十九个课题。1959年1月以来，工人教员除写讲课稿外，还写了八百八十五篇文章，他们说：“写文章的确好，问题经过一写，想得深刻的多了。”我们还采取适当减少工人教员一般会议活动的办法，使他们比工人群众学习的时间每周多二至四小时，实际上多数工人教员都是书本随身带，有空就阅读。会前会后，饭后休息，都是他们宝贵的学习时间。工人教员丁础桥同志不管工作怎么忙，每晚睡觉前至少要看几十分钟书。一年来他读完了《毛泽东选集》第一卷和第二卷，并把《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》读了七、八遍。
    加强党的领导　大搞群众运动
    工人学理论能不能大搞群众运动？我厂一年多来的实践作了肯定的回答。我们的体会是：书记挂帅，放手发动群众，不断扫除思想障碍，支持群众学习的积极性，是推动这一学习运动的重要条件。学习运动一开始，我们就根据自愿原则，把凡是愿意学习的工人都组织起来。学习运动开展过程中碰到各种思想障碍及困难问题，党委书记就亲自来抓，使这些问题迅速解决。同时，党委还采用培养典型，树立榜样的方法，来带动群众。对于一些领导干部忽视工人理论学习的倾向，党委除在运动初期组织辩论过工人能不能学理论的问题外，平时还采用交谈、讨论的办法来解决，或由党委宣传部长向这些同志介绍工人学习情况，使他们了解工人学理论学得很好，从而重视起来。
    加强党的具体领导，是使学习运动开展得既轰轰烈烈又扎实深入的首要保证。学习运动开展不久，党委就成立了全厂的学习领导小组，以党、政、工、团领导同志为主要成员，由党委书记担任组长，经常检查研究关于理论结合实际的教学方针的贯彻情况，对学习内容、培养工人学习骨干等重大问题，经常作出指示，加强了对学习运动的具体领导。在学习领导小组下设全厂的教研室，由各车间派一名优秀工人教员组成，由党委宣传部具体领导，负责研究各个时期学习、讲课的具体内容及培训工人教师的工作。各车间在党支部的领导下设教研组，由工人教员组成，党支部派一名支部委员亲自领导。为了破除工人对理论的神秘感，党委书记和工会主席等领导同志还经常向工人讲课，并和工人一起学习讨论。两年来全厂参加工人教研室和教研组活动的党、团支部书记、车间主任、工会主席共二十八人，占全厂副科级以上领导干部总数的52％。领导干部与工人一起学习，不仅加强了对学习的指导，并且促进了干部深入群众，深入生产，进一步密切了干部与工人群众的关系。
    学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东思想武装工人的头脑，是一项头等重要的政治任务。两年来，我厂工人学习毛泽东同志的著作所取得的成绩，显示了毛泽东思想的巨大力量。“毛泽东思想是力量的源泉”，这是我厂人人传诵的学习心得。我们决心进一步加强和改进对这一学习运动的领导，使运动向更加深入和更高的阶段发展。
