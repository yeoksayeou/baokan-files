To Comrade Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Comrade Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, and Comrade Józef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic:

On the occasion of the 16th anniversary of the National Day of the Polish People's Republic, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, extend our warm and brotherly congratulations to you and, through you, to the Polish United Workers' Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Poland, and the Polish people.

In the past sixteen years, under the leadership of the glorious Polish United Workers' Party and the Government of the Polish People's Republic, the industrious and intelligent Polish people have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Poland has become a socialist industrial and agricultural country with advanced industry. At present, the Polish people are striving with full confidence to complete the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy.

The Polish People's Republic is a strong member of the socialist camp. People's Poland has made important contributions to consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to opposing modern revisionism and safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to opposing the war and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States and safeguarding European and world peace. The Chinese people are sincerely delighted with every achievement made by the fraternal Polish people.

The friendship between the Chinese and Polish people is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and it is unbreakable. We are pleased to see that the fraternal friendship between our two peoples is constantly developing, and the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries have developed in many ways. We are deeply convinced that the ever-growing friendship and cooperation between our two countries not only conform to the fundamental interests of the two peoples but will also be conducive to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and safeguarding world peace.

We wish the Polish people new and greater achievements in their struggle to carry out socialist construction and safeguard world peace. May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish people last forever.

              Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
	      Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
	      Zhuge De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People’s Republic of China
