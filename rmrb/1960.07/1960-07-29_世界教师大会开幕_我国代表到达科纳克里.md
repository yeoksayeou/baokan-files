Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, July 27th: The Third World Teachers' Conference opened in Conakry on the morning of July 27th. Approximately 230 delegates from over fifty countries and numerous observers from Africa and Europe are attending the conference.

After the President of the Conference, Keita Koumandian, Secretary-General of the Black African Teachers' Federation, announced the opening of the conference, Guinean President Sékou Touré delivered the opening address.

In his opening speech, Touré said that in Africa, the cultural traditions of Africans have been shamefully disregarded, and the history of our people has been crudely distorted. In Algeria, the Congo, South Africa, and Southwest Africa, we see that forces of destruction, oppression, and exploitation are running rampant through the heinous so-called theories of superior races and cultures. He condemned these as fundamentally negating culture.

Sékou Touré said that education should not only be extended to the most remote rural areas but should also resolutely conform to the legitimate aspirations of the people.

Touré concluded by saying that peace no longer depends solely on the will of the ruling classes of some countries; peace has become the result of the conscious and courageous actions of the people of all countries themselves.

According to a communiqué issued by the organizing committee of the conference, the agenda includes: current issues in the development of education, culture, and international cooperation; the issue of teachers taking action to defend peace and ease international tensions; and the issue of teachers' social insurance.

The First World Teachers' Conference was held in Vienna in 1953, and the Second Conference was held in Warsaw in 1957.

The Chinese delegation to the Third World Teachers' Conference, led by Fang Ming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Trade Union of China, arrived in Conakry by plane today.

    世界教师大会开幕
    我国代表到达科纳克里
    新华社科纳克里27日电　第三次世界教师大会27日上午在科纳克里开幕。出席这次大会的有来自五十多个国家的约二百三十名代表和来自非洲、欧洲的许多观察员。
    大会主席、黑非洲教师联合会总书记凯塔·库曼迪安宣布大会开幕后，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔致开幕词。
    杜尔在开幕词中说，在非洲的土地上，非洲人的文化传统受到可耻的漠视，我们这些国家的人民的历史被粗暴地歪曲。在阿尔及利亚、刚果、南非和西南非洲，我们看到：通过万恶的所谓优越种族和文化的“理论”，进行破坏、压迫和剥削的势力在为所欲为。他谴责这些都是根本否定文化。
    塞古·杜尔说，教育不仅应该普及到最偏僻的农村，而且应该坚决地符合人民的正当愿望。
    杜尔最后说，和平不再仅仅取决于一些国家的统治阶级的意愿，和平已经成为各国人民自己的有觉悟的勇敢的行动的结果。
    根据大会组织委员会发表的公报，大会的议程包括：发展教育、文化和国际合作的当前问题，关于教师为保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势采取行动的问题以及教师和社会保险问题。
    第一次世界教师大会是1953年在维也纳举行的，第二次大会1957年举行于华沙。
    由中国教育工会全国委员会副主席方明率领的出席第三次世界教师大会的中国代表团，今天乘飞机到达科纳克里。
