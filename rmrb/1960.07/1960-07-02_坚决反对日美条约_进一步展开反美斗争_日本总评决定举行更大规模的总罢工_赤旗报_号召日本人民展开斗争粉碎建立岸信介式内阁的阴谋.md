Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 1st—The expanded meeting of councilors of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), which began yesterday in Atami City, closed this afternoon.

    Today's meeting enthusiastically discussed the draft motion of the General Council's secretariat to this councilors' meeting regarding this year's movement policy. This draft stipulates that Sohyo should, together with the broad masses of the people, promote the political struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and, at the same time, reorganize and strengthen trade union organizations.

    The meeting also decided, based on suggestions during the discussion, to supplement the following content in the draft movement policy: The goals of the national movement are: (1) to defend peace and maintain democracy; (2) to eliminate poverty and unemployment; (3) to safeguard peaceful education; and (4) to formulate a national budget of the people's own. To regain the right to strike for public servants, workplace assemblies should be repeatedly held.

    Based on the opinions of today's meeting, the General Council's secretariat decided to formulate a final draft of the movement policy before the 10th and submit it to the regular national convention scheduled for early August.

    The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution encouraging workers in Saitama, Aomori, and Gunma prefectures who are actively engaged in the prefectural governor election struggle.

    At the meeting, the representative of the Akita Prefectural Council of Trade Unions emphasized that Sohyo must currently hold high the banner of opposing illegal suppression, opposing the ruling party's behind-the-scenes transfer of power, and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and must hold a large-scale strike, surpassing the scale of June 22nd, by July 15th at the latest.

    Many trade union representatives emphasized the need to summarize the achievements and experiences of past struggles against the new "Security Treaty" and to further expand the anti-American struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty" in the future.

    After the meeting, a meeting of representatives of local trade unions from various prefectures continued in Atami to discuss specific preparations for the general election.

    The meeting decided to launch a struggle against suppression, not recognizing the new "Security Treaty," opposing the establishment of a "second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet," and rectifying reactionary politicians before July 9th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 1st—The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published an editorial today calling on the people to strengthen the struggle to smash the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to strive for the establishment of a democratic caretaker government, to smash the conspiracy to establish a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet, and to oppose the repressive measures used against the Japanese people participating in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

    The "Red Flag" editorial pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and Japan's traitorous monopoly groups are now engaged in conspiratorial activities, attempting to replace the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet with a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet in order to promote a military alliance policy and to suppress the Japanese people participating in the patriotic and just struggle by fascist means.

    The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group is plotting retaliatory attacks against members of the Japanese Communist Party, members of the Democratic Youth League, and the heroic workers who are at the forefront of the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    The editorial said, however, "The National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty has already decided on June 28th to oppose retaliatory measures against those participating in the anti-'Security Treaty' movement with a nationwide strike. The National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union have decided that if disciplinary measures are taken against workers, they will hold a strike."

    The editorial pointed out that workers of trade unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan have launched protest actions. On June 30th, one thousand workers held protest demonstrations against the National Railway Corporation's proposed disciplinary measures, and in the next few days, 30,000 workers will take similar action against the National Railway Corporation authorities and the Ministry of Posts. Actions against the reactionaries will once again be launched throughout the country.

    The editorial said, "The workers taking protest action not only oppose repressive measures, but also demand the abolition of the 'Security Treaty' and the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and oppose the conspiracy to replace the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet with a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet."

    "Kishi Nobusuke and his assistants are not qualified to interfere in the establishment of the next cabinet. None of them are qualified to regain state power. The Japanese people cannot tolerate this kind of thing."

    The editorial pointed out that in such a situation, the urgent task of the democratic forces and the Japanese people is to smash the reactionary faction's sinister attempt to establish a Kishi Nobusuke-style cabinet and to smash the repressive measures used against the Japanese people.

    The editorial said, "There is only one way to achieve this, and that is to establish a caretaker government composed only of political leaders who have not participated in the sinister activities, and to dissolve the Diet under the leadership of such a government."

    坚决反对日美条约　进一步展开反美斗争
    日本总评决定举行更大规模的总罢工
   “赤旗报”号召日本人民展开斗争粉碎建立岸信介式内阁的阴谋
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会昨天开始在热海市举行的评议员扩大会议今天下午闭幕。
    今天的会议热烈讨论了“总评”干事会向这次评议员会议提出的今年度运动方针草案。这个草案规定，“总评”要同广大的国民一起，推进反对新日美“安全条约”的政治斗争，同时，要改编工会，加强工会的组织。
    会议并且根据讨论中的建议决定在运动方针草案中补充下列内容：国民运动的目标是：（一）保卫和平和维护民主；（二）消灭贫困和失业；（三）维护和平教育；（四）制订人民自己的国家预算。为了夺回公务人员的罢工权，要反复举行工作场所大会。
    根据今天的大会意见，“总评”干事会决定在10日以前拟出运动方针的最后草案提交预定8月初举行的定期全国大会。
    会议还一致通过了鼓励正在积极进行县知事竞选斗争的琦玉、青森和群马三县工人的决议。
    在会上，秋田县工会评议会代表强调说，“总评”目前必须高举反对非法镇压、反对执政党私相授受政权、要求立即解散国会的旗帜，并且至迟在7月15日以前举行超过六·二二规模的声势浩大的罢工。
    许多工会代表们强调指出有必要总结过去反对新“安全条约”斗争的成就和经验并今后进一步展开争取废除新“安全条约”等反美斗争。
    会议结束后继续在热海举行了各县地方工会代表会议，讨论了有关大选的具体准备事宜。
    会议决定要在7月9日以前展开反对镇压、不承认新“安全条约”、反对成立“第二个岸信介内阁”、整肃反动政客的斗争。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召人民为粉碎新日美“安全条约”、争取建立民主的看守政府、为粉碎建立岸信介式内阁的阴谋、反对用以对付参加反对“安全条约”运动的日本人民的镇压措施而加强斗争。
      “赤旗报”社论指出，美帝国主义者和日本的卖国垄断集团现在正在进行阴谋活动，企图以一个岸信介式内阁来代替岸信介内阁，以便推行军事同盟政策，并且以法西斯手段来镇压参加爱国和正义斗争的日本人民。
    社论指出，岸信介集团正阴谋对日本共产党人、民主青年同盟盟员和站在反对“安全条约”斗争前列的英勇工人进行报复性的攻击。
    社论说，但是，“阻止修改安全条约国民会议已经在6月28日决定以全国性罢工来反对镇压参加反对‘安全条约’运动的人的报复性措施。国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会已经决定，如果对工人采取惩办措施，他们就要举行罢工。”
    社论指出，日本工会总评议会所属工会的工人已经发动了抗议行动。在6月30日，一千名工人举行抗议示威，反对国营铁道公司拟议中的惩办措施，在今后几天内，三万名工人还将采取同样的行动以反对国营铁道公司当局和邮政省。全国各地将再次掀起反对反动派的行动。
    社论说，“采取抗议行动的工人不仅反对镇压措施，而且还要求废除‘安全条约’和立即解散国会，并反对使岸信介式的内阁来代替岸信介内阁的阴谋”。
    “岸信介和他的助手没有资格干预下届内阁的建立。他们之中没有任何人有资格再取得国家权力。日本人民不能容忍这种事情。”
    社论指出，在这样的情况下，民主力量和日本人民的紧迫任务是粉碎反动派建立岸信介式内阁的罪恶企图，并且粉碎用来对付日本人民的镇压措施。
    社论说，“要实现这一点只有一种办法，那就是建立只由没有参加罪恶活动的政治领袖所组成的看守政府，并且在这种政府领导下解散国会。”
