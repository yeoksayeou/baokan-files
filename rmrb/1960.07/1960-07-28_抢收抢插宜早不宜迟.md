It is better to seize and transplant early rather than late

"Double Rush" has begun. Harvesting early rice well and transplanting late rice well are the most important things to decide on a bumper harvest in agricultural production throughout the year. Take our production team as an example. The team has 249.7 mu of early rice to be harvested, 250 mu of late rice to be transplanted, and 36 mu of autumn miscellaneous crops to be planted. Whether the grain production plan for this year can be completed depends on this time.

Grasping grain production firmly and resolutely implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" is not only the responsibility of cadres, but also the responsibility of all our members. As the saying goes, "Roots need fertilizer, and mouths need food," and "People are iron, and food is steel." When people have food to eat, everything is easy to handle. For the country, grain is even more important. With the development of agriculture, socialist construction can develop by leaps and bounds, all undertakings can achieve an all-round leap forward, and people's lives can be continuously improved, truly achieving abundant harvests of grains, thriving livestock, abundant food and clothing, and a joyous atmosphere. Therefore, we must fight well in the "Double Rush," seize a comprehensive bumper harvest, and achieve a better leap forward this year.

This year's "Double Rush" is different from previous years. In our team alone, the double-cropping rice area has more than doubled compared to last year. The number of laborers at home this year has also decreased by four compared to last year. In addition, the maturity period of early rice this year is six or seven days later than last year, and the "Double Rush" time has been shortened, making the work even tighter. What should we do? Bow our heads to difficulties? No! The workers and peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party never bow their heads to difficulties. Is there a shortage of labor? The team has recently taken some measures to immediately concentrate 128 people into the "Double Rush" battle, which is 60 more laborers than the original number of agricultural workers. Is the work tight? With labor, as long as everyone works together, implements hard work plus smart work, and arranges work reasonably, there will be a way to deal with it, no matter how tight it is. If you want to fill the granary with golden grains, how can you be reluctant to shed a few drops of sweat?

However, a few members still don't understand this principle. They have not recognized the characteristics of this year's "Double Rush," and they need to seize the season and do a good job in the "Double Rush." For example, some people say, "This year is a leap month of June, and it will still be hot after the Beginning of Autumn. It doesn't matter if it's a little later." Some think that "Double Rush" is too tense. This is certainly wrong. We are all farmers and know that "Transplanting seedlings is like taking an exam, and managing rice is like snatching treasure." July 23 is "Major Heat." "Look at the seedlings during Minor Heat, and eat grain during Major Heat." We must seize every minute and second to win a bumper harvest. As the saying goes, "Late rice should not be later than the Beginning of Autumn, or nine out of ten will not be harvested." Although this year is a leap month of June, a leap year does not mean a leap season. It is better to do everything early than late. For example, 1957 was also a leap month. The upper field of the two waterwheels in Lijiaping was transplanted three days before the Beginning of Autumn, with a yield of 387 jin per mu; the lower field was transplanted four days after the Beginning of Autumn, with a yield of only 146 jin per mu. It can be seen that only by seizing the season can we win a bumper harvest. Furthermore, although the "Double Rush" is a little tense, it is a major event related to the production of the whole year and the lives of all members. It is the most glorious task for every member to actively participate in the "Double Rush" battle. This kind of "tension" is a normal phenomenon in the Great Leap Forward. Now we are working hard precisely to win a bumper harvest and gain the initiative in all future work. Speaking of tension, before liberation, our poor people had no roof over their heads, no land under their feet, and no food or clothing. That was real tension!

    抢收抢插宜早不宜迟
    湖南湘阴县汨罗人民公社百丈大队门楼生产队社员  萧皇宝
    “双抢”开始了，收好早稻插好晚稻，这是决定全年农业生产大丰收的一件顶重要的事情。拿我们生产队来说，全队有二百四十九点七亩早稻要收，还要插下二百五十亩晚稻，种下三十六亩秋杂作物。今年的粮食产量计划能不能完成，就决定在这个时候。
    狠狠抓好粮食生产，坚决贯彻执行“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针，不只是干部的事，也是我们全体社员的责任。俗话说：“生根的要肥，生口的要吃”、“人是铁，饭是钢”，人有了饭吃，什么事情都好办。对国家来说，粮食就更重要了，农业发展了，社会主义建设就能飞跃发展，各项事业就能全面跃进，人民生活就能不断提高，真正做到五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，丰衣足食，喜气盈盈。因此，我们一定要打好“双抢”仗，夺取全面大丰收，实现今年更好的跃进。
    今年的“双抢”比往年不同。单我们队里，双季稻面积就比去年增加一倍多，今年在家劳力比去年还减少四个，加上今年早稻成熟期比去年推迟六、七天，“双抢”时间缩短了，工夫更紧了。怎么办呢？向困难低头吗？不！在共产党领导下的工人农民，从来是不向困难低头的。劳力不足吧，队上最近采取一些办法，马上集中了一百二十八人投入“双抢”战斗，比原来出农业工的劳力还多出六十个。工夫紧吧，有了劳力，只要大家齐心合力，实行苦干加巧干，合理排工，再紧也有办法。要使黄金谷子堆满仓，舍不得出几身黑汗怎么行咧？
    可是，有少数社员还不大明白这个道理，他们没有认清今年“双抢”的特点，更要抓住季节，搞好“双抢”。比如，有的人说：“今年闰6月，过了立秋天还热，迟一点没关系。”有的认为“双抢”太紧张。这当然是不对的。我们都是作田人，懂得“插秧如赶考，扮禾如抢宝。”7月23日是“大暑”，“小暑看苗，大暑吃谷”，更要争分抢秒，才能夺得大丰收。俗话说：“晚稻不过秋，过秋九不收”。今年虽然闰6月，但是闰年并不闰季节，百般宜早不宜迟。比如，1957年也是闰一个月，李家坪上下两个戽丘，上戽丘是秋前三天插的，亩产三百八十七斤；下戽丘是秋后四天插的，亩产只一百四十六斤。可见，只有抢住季节，才能赢得丰收。再说，“双抢”中固然紧张一点，但这是关系到全年生产和全体社员生活的大事，每个社员积极投入“双抢”战斗，是最光荣的任务。这种“紧张”是大跃进中的正常现象。现在我们辛勤劳动，正是为了夺取丰收，取得今后一切工作的主动。要说紧张，解放前我们穷人家上无片瓦，下无寸土，衣食无着的生活，那才是真正的紧张咧！
