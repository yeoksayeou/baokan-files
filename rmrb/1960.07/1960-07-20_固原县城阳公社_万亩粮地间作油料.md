　　Ten Thousand Mu of Grain Land Interplanted with Oil Crops

　　(Our report) This summer, Chengyang Commune in Guyuan County, Ningxia, will expand the area of intercropping grain and oil crops, interplanting rapeseed in 10,000 mu of buckwheat land to ensure a bumper harvest of both grain and oil.

　　Chengyang Commune has a relatively hot climate, suitable for growing rapeseed crops. However, in the past, due to limited resources, rapeseed production was minimal. In 1958, the commune leaders broke with superstition and trial-planted 398 mu of rapeseed in the Honghe Brigade, achieving a bumper harvest with a yield of about 50 jin per mu. In the same year, they also focused on promoting the method of intercropping millet or buckwheat with rapeseed, again achieving a double harvest of grain and oil. Intercropping grain and rapeseed involves planting rapeseed when planting buckwheat or millet. After the buckwheat or millet is harvested, the rapeseed just grows leaves and lies on the ground. After a winter, it is harvested before the winter wheat harvest in the second year, and another crop of buckwheat or millet can be planted, achieving three harvests in two years. The masses say this method is a double harvest.

　　The commune Party committee, in summarizing this approach, believes it has four major advantages: First, it can make full use of the land, achieving double harvests in one field and increasing income. In 1958, the Qinjiagou team of the Honghe Brigade interplanted rapeseed in 14 mu of Xiaoriyue millet fields, resulting in a harvest of 150 jin of millet in the same year and 50 jin of rapeseed last year. Second, it can rationally rotate crops and increase soil fertility. The roots and leaves of rapeseed rot in the ground and serve as good fertilizer. Land planted with rapeseed is superior for planting millet or winter wheat. Third, because it grows through the winter, it can increase yields. At the same time, because it is intercropped, it can greatly save labor and alleviate the labor shortage during the wheat harvest season. Fourth, rapeseed has high returns, high value, and a wide range of uses. The masses use indigenous methods to extract oil, with 100 jin of rapeseed yielding 25 to 30 jin of oil.

　　This year, the commune Party committee plans to expand the area of grain and oil intercropping to 10,000 mu. The buckwheat fields have now been plowed, and 2,000 jin of fertile soil have been applied to each mu of land. Ten half-mountain and half-plain brigades, including Honghe, Shangwang, and Youlian, have prepared the seeds. Heyuan, Xiayuan, and other brigades that have not grown rapeseed before are also actively preparing and exchanging seeds with other teams, preparing to fully launch the planting.

### 固原县城阳公社　万亩粮地间作油料

　　固原县城阳公社
　　万亩粮地间作油料
    本报讯　宁夏固原县城阳公社今年夏种中将扩大粮油间种面积，在一万亩荞麦地里带种油菜，保证粮油丰收。
    城阳公社气候较热，适于种植油菜作物。但是，过去因为受力量限制，油菜生产很少。一九五八年，公社领导破除迷信，在红河大队试种了三百九十八亩油菜，获得了丰收，每亩产量达五十斤左右。当年，还重点推行了糜子或荞麦和油菜间作的方法，又获得了粮油双丰收。粮食和油菜间作，是在种荞麦或糜子时带种上油菜，等荞麦或糜子收后，油菜刚刚长出叶子伏在地面。经过一冬，在第二年收冬麦之前收割，收后还可以再种一槎荞麦或糜子，达到两年三收。群众说这种办法是双丰收。
    公社党委在总结这种做法时，认为有四大好处：第一，可以充分利用土地，一地双收，增加收入。一九五八年红河大队秦家沟小队，在十四亩小日月糜子田里带种了油菜，结果当年收糜子一百五十斤，去年又收油菜子五十斤。第二，能合理倒槎，增加土地肥力。油菜的根和叶在地里腐烂后，都是好肥料，种过油菜的地，再种糜子或冬小麦都是上槎地。第三，因为经过一冬的生长，可以提高产量；同时因为是间种，可以大大节省劳力，缓和麦收期间劳力的紧张。第四，油菜子收益多、价值高、用途广，群众用土法榨油，一百斤油菜子可出油二十五斤到三十斤。
    今年，公社党委准备扩大粮油间作面积一万亩。现在荞麦地已经翻犁好了，每亩田已送上二千斤土肥。红河、上王、友联等十个半山半川大队，已经把种子准备好，何塬、夏塬等没有种过油菜的大队，也积极准备，和其他队串换了种子，准备全面展开播种。
