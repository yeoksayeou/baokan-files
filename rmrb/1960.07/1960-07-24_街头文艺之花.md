Street Art Blossoms

    On weekend evenings, the People's Liberation Monument, towering in Chongqing, appears particularly magnificent, truly a scene of brilliant lights and resounding songs. White-haired elders, innocent and lively Young Pioneers, spirited workers, peasants, and urban commune members all stream in from all directions, packing the street square, which can hold tens of thousands of people, to the point of overflowing, forming a joyful torrent. Indeed, the weekend cultural activities at Chongqing's Liberation Monument are very appealing, not only warmly welcomed by the people of the mountain city but also highly appreciated by visitors from other places and foreign dignitaries.

    A Product of the Great Leap Forward

    The bugle call of the Great Leap Forward resounded throughout the country and also stirred the majestic mountain city. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, mass cultural and artistic activities became even more active. The masses not only demanded to read good books but also wanted to see good plays and listen to good music. Active members of amateur artistic activities also wanted their self-written and self-performed programs to be seen by the broad masses. In order to meet the needs of the broad masses, the cultural departments of Chongqing actively led the masses to launch a large-scale cultural propaganda campaign, and also used the Liberation Monument as a position to vigorously promote cultural propaganda. According to incomplete statistics, since the Red May of 1958, more than fifty central, provincial, and municipal professional art troupes, and more than two hundred and twenty amateur art organizations, have performed more than three thousand programs of various forms here, totaling more than three hundred and twenty performances, with an audience of more than three million three hundred thousand people. In the recent anti-American propaganda week alone, more than one hundred and twenty thousand people watched the street art performances at the Liberation Monument.

    Serving Politics

    To coordinate with every major political movement or the current central task, many good programs popular with the masses must appear on the stage of the Liberation Monument. This is a characteristic of the Liberation Monument's cultural activities. Such as opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Lebanon, supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people, opposing U.S. imperialism's occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, celebrating the early completion of the 1958 steel production task, celebrating the great victory of the people's commune movement and the general line, the propaganda of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, as well as the propaganda of opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace, etc., have all achieved good results and played a positive role in raising the political and ideological awareness of the masses and encouraging production enthusiasm. During this anti-American propaganda week, the actors were full of fighting spirit, the audience was in high spirits, and the stage and audience echoed each other, constantly shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism" and "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people."

    A Riot of Color

    The cultural activities of the Liberation Monument are not only strong in ideology, but also artistically colorful and fascinating. It is no exaggeration to say that the cultural activities of the Liberation Monument are a riot of color. Performing here are the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Central Orchestra from Beijing, the Yue Opera House and the Chorus from Shanghai, the Music and Folk Art Troupe from Guangdong, the Flower Lantern and Peking Opera from Yunnan and Guizhou, the Bangzi and Qin Opera from Shanxi and Shaanxi, as well as troupes from various special districts and counties in the province and other provinces and cities that have performed in Chongqing. The programs are short, concise, lively, and diverse, and the content is ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, everything is available, which not only educates the masses politically and ideologically, but also gives the masses cultural and artistic enjoyment. Therefore, it is very popular and supported by the masses. Some viewers attend almost every time, and some come with their whole families. Factories, schools, and shops nearby actively send outstanding Party members and Youth League members to assist in stage work and maintain order. For excellent programs, the audience always warmly applauds and welcomes encores and repeats. Once, at a concert, it unfortunately started to rain in the middle of the performance, but the audience did not leave, and the actors were encouraged and performed in the rain.

    Development and Promotion

    Street art performances are a form of propaganda that is closest to the masses and adapts to the characteristics of the city. It inherits the fine tradition of the Party's revolutionary art and literature. Therefore, the cultural leading departments of Chongqing promoted the experience of the Liberation Monument's street art activities throughout the city last year. Now there are twelve performance points similar to the Liberation Monument in the city. There are propaganda performances every holiday, attracting tens of thousands of people and achieving good results. Since the National Day last year, the Liberation Monument has set up a double stage, which can be performed on both sides at the same time, further meeting the needs of the masses; at the same time, the activities are more colorful than in the past. In addition to regular cultural propaganda performances, film screenings, and regular new song teaching, there are also mobile picture exhibitions, mobile showcases, street poetry and painting windows, mass painting columns, book and picture supplies, and folk forms of art performances (such as dragon lanterns, lions, painted boats, fire meteors...etc.).

    The Liberation Monument is the commercial center of the mountain city. With the development of the times, it has rapidly become the center of mass cultural activities on weekends in the mountain city. We warmly look forward to the flowers of street art in the mountain city—the cultural activities on the streets of the Liberation Monument—blooming more brightly and beautifully.

    街头文艺之花
    殷树林
    周末的晚上，巍然矗立在重庆的人民解放纪念碑，显得格外壮丽，真是灯火辉煌、歌声嘹亮；白发苍苍的老人，天真活泼的红领巾、精神抖擞的工人、农民、城市公社社员，都从四面八方涌来，把一个能容纳几万人的街头广场，挤得水泄不通，形成一道欢乐的洪流。的确，重庆解放碑的周末文艺活动是很吸引人的，不仅受到山城人民热烈的欢迎，就是外地来客，国外贵宾，都对它十分欣赏。
    大跃进的产物
    大跃进的号角，响遍了全国，也沸腾了雄峻的山城。随着工农业的飞跃发展，群众文化艺术活动也更加活跃起来了，群众不仅要求读好书，还需要看好戏，听好音乐；业余文艺活动的积极分子们，也要求让自编自演的节目和广大群众见面。为了满足广大群众的需要，重庆市的文化部门积极领导群众展开了声势浩大的文艺宣传活动，同时也利用解放碑这一阵地，大搞文艺宣传。据不完全统计，自1958年红五月以来，有五十几个中央、省、市的专业艺术团体，和二百二十多个业余艺术组织，在这里演出了三千多个不同形式的节目，共计三百二十多场，观众达三百三十多万人次。仅在最近的反美宣传周中，就有十二万多群众观看了解放碑的街头文艺演出。
    为政治服务
    配合每一个重大的政治运动或当前的中心任务，解放碑的舞台上都要出现许多群众喜闻乐见的好节目，这是解放碑文艺活动的特点。如反对美帝侵略黎巴嫩、支援伊拉克人民的革命斗争、反对美帝侵占我国领土台湾、庆祝1958年钢铁生产任务的提前完成、庆祝人民公社化运动和总路线的伟大胜利、八届八中全会公报、决议的宣传，以及反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的宣传等等，都收到了良好的效果，对提高群众的政治思想觉悟、鼓舞生产热情都起了积极的作用。在这次反美宣传周中，演员们斗志昂扬、观众情绪高涨，台上台下互相呼应，不时高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人”等口号。
    百花争艳
    解放碑的文艺活动不仅思想性强，在艺术性上来说，也是万紫千红，引人入胜。如说解放碑的文艺活动是百花争艳，这一点都不夸张。在这里演出的，有从北京来的中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团、中央乐团，上海来的越剧院、合唱团，广东来的音乐曲艺团，云南、贵州来的花灯和京剧，山西和陕西来的梆子和秦腔，以及省内各专区、县和其他省市到过重庆演出的剧团。节目是短小精悍、活泼多样，而内容又是古今中外，应有尽有，既使群众受到政治思想教育，又给群众以文化艺术的享受，因此很受群众欢迎和支持，有的观众几乎每次必到，有的是全家出动；附近的工厂、学校、商店，主动派出优秀的党团员来协助舞台工作，维持秩序；对优秀的节目，观众总是热烈鼓掌欢迎谢幕和重演。有一次开音乐会，不巧在演出中途下起雨来，但观众一直不走，演员受到了鼓舞，也冒雨演出。
    发展和推广
    街头文艺演出是一种最接近群众，适应城市特点的宣传形式，它继承了党的革命文艺的优良传统，因此，重庆市的文化领导部门去年就在全市推广了解放碑街头文艺活动的经验，现在全市已有类似解放碑这样的演出点十二个，每逢假期节日都有宣传演出，吸引了成千上万的群众，收到很好的效果。从去年国庆节起，解放碑已搭起了双台子，可以两边同时演出，进一步满足了群众的需要；同时活动也比过去更加丰富多彩了。除有经常性的文艺宣传演出、电影放映、定时的新歌教唱之外，还有流动图片展览、流动橱窗、街头诗画窗、群众画栏、图书图片供应、民间形式的文艺表演（如龙灯、狮子、彩船、火流星……等）。
    解放碑是山城的商业中心，它随着时代的发展，已迅速成为山城周末群众文化活动的中心了。我们热烈盼望山城街头文艺的花朵——解放碑街头的文艺活动，开得更鲜更美。
