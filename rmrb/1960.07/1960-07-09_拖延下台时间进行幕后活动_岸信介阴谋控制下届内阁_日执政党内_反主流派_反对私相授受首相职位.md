Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Tokyo dispatch: Under the manipulation of Nobusuke Kishida, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan still failed to reach an agreement in the five-person leadership meeting held on the 7th regarding which of Hayato Ikeda, Banboku Ohno, and Kōjirō Ishii should succeed Nobusuke Kishida.

According to a report by Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) radio, the Kishida Nobusuke and Eisaku Sato factions, which have the largest number of Diet members within the Liberal Democratic Party, are conducting intense behind-the-scenes activities in order to maintain their power in the next administration even after Nobusuke Kishida resigns. This is the most important reason why Nobusuke Kishida is delaying his resignation. The radio station pointed out that Nobusuke Kishida wants to bestow "favors" on the future prime minister in order to maintain his right to speak in the next administration.

The radio station said that the Liberal Democratic Party's five leaders (Deputy Prime Minister Masuya Hideji, Minister of Finance Eisaku Sato, Speaker of the House of Councillors Tsuruhei Matsuno, Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima, and Chairman of the Members' Association Yuzo Shigemune) will ultimately depend on the attitudes of Nobusuke Kishida and Eisaku Sato. The radio station said: If these two brothers "play a role," they will increase the "weight" of the policies that Prime Minister Kishida hopes for in the next cabinet, namely "restoring trust with the United States and establishing security countermeasures."

The Liberal Democratic Party's five-person leadership meeting on the 7th merely reaffirmed the principle of using "consultation" to determine the next prime minister candidate, according to Nobusuke Kishida's intentions. The reason why Nobusuke Kishida is trying everything possible to avoid electing a president at the Liberal Democratic Party's general meeting is because he fears that he will not be able to control the five hundred members who make up half of all the representatives. If the prime minister is selected by "consultation" and elected at a meeting of Diet members, the more than one hundred Diet members of the Nobusuke Kishida group can "play a decisive role."

This practice of privately transferring the position of prime minister by the Kishida Nobusuke group has aroused opposition from the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party. According to reports, members of the Matsumura-Miki faction have decided to nominate Kenzo Matsumura as a candidate for prime minister to participate in the election.

### 拖延下台时间进行幕后活动  岸信介阴谋控制下届内阁  日执政党内“反主流派”反对私相授受首相职位

    拖延下台时间进行幕后活动
    岸信介阴谋控制下届内阁
    日执政党内“反主流派”反对私相授受首相职位
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：在岸信介操纵下，日本执政党自由民主党在7日举行的五位负责人会谈中，仍然没有就池田勇人、大野伴睦和石井光次郎等三人谁来接替岸信介上台问题达成协议。
    据日本广播协会电台透露，在自由民主党内拥有议员人数最多的岸信介、佐藤荣作两派，为了在岸信介辞职后也能在下届政权中保持他们的势力，正在紧张地进行幕后活动，这是岸信介拖延下台的最重要原因。这家电台指出，岸信介想对未来的首相施予“恩惠”，以便在下届政权中保持自己的发言权。
    这家电台说，自由民主党的五位负责人（副首相益谷秀次、大藏相佐藤荣作、参议院议长松野鹤平、干事长川岛正次郎、议员会会长重宗雄三）会谈，最后仍将取决于岸信介和佐藤荣作的态度。电台说：如果这两个兄弟“发挥作用”，就会在下届内阁中加重岸首相所希望的“恢复对美国的信用和确立治安对策”的政策的“分量”。
    7日的自由民主党五位负责人会谈只不过是按照岸信介的意图再次肯定用“协商”办法来决定下届首相人选的原则。岸信介所以要千方百计地避免在自由民主党党员大会上选举总裁，就是怕控制不了全体代表半数的五百名党员。如果以“协商”方法选定首相和在国会议员大会上选举首相，岸信介集团所拥有的一百多名议员就可以“举足轻重”。
    岸信介集团的这种私下授受首相职位的作法引起了自由民主党内“反主流派”的反对。据报道，松村—三木派议员决定推举松村谦三为首相候选人，参加竞选。
