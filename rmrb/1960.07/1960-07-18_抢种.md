　　Rushing to Plant
　　Members of the Zhuli Commune, Weifang, Shandong, Zhao Chao, Hu Zhizhong

　　Heavy rain pours from the sky,
　　Strong winds break branches,
　　Hens huddle in doorways,
　　Sparrows hide under eaves.
　　The village is quiet,
　　But the slopes are filled with lively voices,
　　Regardless of the fierce wind and heavy rain,
　　The secretary leads the planting of sweet potatoes.
　　Don't underestimate the secretary's refined demeanor,
　　He is an expert when it comes to work.
　　The youth team leader secretly spurs himself on,
　　Not falling behind him at all.
　　Twenty mu are planted in one go,
　　Sweat exceeding even the rain,
　　The secretary looks up,
　　A wisp of a smile hangs at the corner of his mouth.
　　Horizontal rows and vertical ridges,
　　Uniform spacing and density,
　　The rain-soaked sweet potato seedlings are lush and green,
　　Resembling a colorful painting.
　　He wipes his muddy hands and pats his face,
　　Joyfully speaking:
　　"With so many people and so much energy,
　　This battle is fought excellently."
　　Everyone is truly happy to hear this,
　　Answering in unison:
　　"With the Party leading us,
　　What is overturning rivers and seas!
　　We can control mountains and rivers,
　　We will hold up the sky if it falls."

　　山东潍坊朱里公社社员　赵超　胡执中大雨劈天盖地下，大风刮断树枝丫，母鸡钻进门洞里，麻雀躲在屋檐下。庄里冷清清，满坡人喧哗，不管风紧雨点猛，书记带头栽地瓜。别看书记挺文雅，干起活来是行家。青年队长暗鼓劲，一点也没拉下他。一气栽完二十亩，汗水倒比雨水大，书记抬头瞅了瞅，一缕笑纹嘴边挂。横成行来竖成垅，稀密规格没有差，雨淋瓜苗绿茵茵，恰似一副彩色画。他擦净泥手抹抹脸，满心欢喜把话啦：“凭着人多干劲足，这仗打得顶呱呱。”大伙听说真高兴，异口同声忙回答：我们有了党领导，翻江倒海算个啥！高山大河听摆布，老天塌了顶住它。
