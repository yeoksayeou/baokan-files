Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 17th: Members of the Yuxi Commune in Fuqing County, the hometown of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, victims of the Zhima Market Massacre, held a rally on the 15th, unanimously supporting the note presented by our government to the Indonesian government.

Lin Bingwang, Ye Jinniang's son, said angrily: The murderers of my mother by the West Java military authorities are still at large. I fully support the solemn stance taken by our government, and the Indonesian government must make a wise response. Lin Dunyuan, a relative of Yang Mumei, said: The various demands put forward by our government are reasonable. This is not only supported by all the Chinese people, but will also receive the sympathy and support of the Indonesian people.

Lin Ximeng, a 67-year-old returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a relative of the two victims, said: The crime of a small group of forces in Indonesia that are hostile to Sino-Indonesian friendship in killing my niece-in-law and grand-niece-in-law cannot be denied. It violates the promises and expressions of goodwill repeatedly made by the Indonesian government. Lin Ximeng expressed his full support for the strong protest and solemn demands made by our government to the Indonesian government.

Huang Zongxiang, director of the Yuxi Branch of the Fuqing County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the rally: The broad masses of the Indonesian people are friendly to overseas Chinese. The anti-Chinese and discriminatory actions are deliberately created by a small group of reactionary forces to please American imperialism and suppress domestic patriotic and democratic forces. However, the eyes of the broad masses of the Indonesian people are discerning, and the attempt of the Indonesian reactionary forces to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people is just wishful thinking. More than 10,000 overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese in our Yuxi Commune resolutely support our government's strong protest and demand that the Indonesian government, for the sake of maintaining friendly relations between the two countries, accept the various reasonable demands in the note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Speakers at the meeting expressed their gratitude to the motherland's government for its solemn stance in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and for the concern shown for this incident.

　　杨木妹、叶金娘的家乡集会
　　拥护我外交部严正立场
    新华社福州17日电　芝马圩惨案死难者杨木妹、叶金娘的家乡福清县渔溪公社的社员15日举行集会，一致拥护我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出的照会。
    叶金娘的儿子林秉望愤怒地说：西爪哇军事当局杀害我母亲的凶手至今还逍遥法外。我完全拥护我国政府所采取的严正立场，印度尼西亚政府必须作出明智的答复。杨木妹的亲属林敦渊说：我国政府提出的各项要求是合情合理的。这不仅为全中国人民所拥护，也将得到印度尼西亚人民的同情和支持。
    两位死难者的亲属、六十七岁的印度尼西亚归侨林溪孟说：印度尼西亚一小撮敌视中印
  （尼）友好的势力杀害我的侄媳妇和侄孙媳妇的罪行是抵赖不了的。它违背了印度尼西亚政府一再作出的诺言和所表示的友好愿望。林溪孟表示完全拥护我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出的强硬抗议和严正要求。
    福清县归国华侨联合会渔溪分会主任黄宗祥在集会上说：印度尼西亚广大人民是同华侨友好的，反华排华只是一小撮反动势力为达到讨好美帝国主义、打击国内爱国民主力量的目的所蓄意制造的。但是印度尼西亚广大人民的眼睛是雪亮的，印度尼西亚反动势力企图破坏中印（尼）人民的友谊只是妄想。我们渔溪公社一万多侨眷归侨坚决拥护我国政府的强硬抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府从维护两国的友好关系着想，接受我国外交部照会中的各项合理要求。
    在会上发言的人都表示感谢祖国政府维护华侨的正当权利和利益的严正立场以及对这一事件所表示的关怀。
