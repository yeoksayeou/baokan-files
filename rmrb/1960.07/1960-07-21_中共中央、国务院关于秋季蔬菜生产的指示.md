This year's autumn vegetable production is of greater significance than in previous years. Doing a good job in this year's autumn vegetable production will not only basically guarantee the vegetable needs of urban and rural people in the autumn, winter, and next spring, but also provide favorable conditions for further improving canteens and promoting the continued consolidation and development of canteens. At the same time, a large increase in autumn vegetable production can also effectively prevent disasters and prepare for famine in the event of drought or flood disasters in some areas. While taking grain as the key link and first rapidly developing grain production, it is necessary to vigorously develop vegetable production and better arrange the lives of 650 million people. This is a major economic task and a major political task for all Party comrades, all state workers, and the people of the whole country.

    今年秋菜生产比往年有更大的意义。搞好今年的秋菜生产，不但可以基本上保证城市和乡村人民秋季、冬季和明年春季的蔬菜需要，而且可以为进一步办好食堂提供有利条件，促进食堂的继续巩固和发展。同时，大量增产秋菜，也可以在某些地方发生旱涝灾害的情况下，有效地防灾备荒。必须在以粮为纲、首先迅速发展粮食生产的同时，大力发展蔬菜生产，更好地安排六亿五千万人民的生活。这是全党同志、全体国家工作人员和全国人民的一项重大的经济任务，也是一项重大的政治任务。——摘自中共中央、国务院关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示
