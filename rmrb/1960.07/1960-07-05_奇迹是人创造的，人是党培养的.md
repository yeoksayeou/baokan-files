    Miracles are created by people, and people are nurtured by the Party
    Zhao Xixiang, Secretary of the CCP Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory Branch
    After the feature article "Miracles are Created by People" (collected in "One Day of the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai") was published, many workers in our factory rushed to read it. Some said, "After reading this article and thinking about the past battles, I feel more and more energetic! We will continue to work hard in the future!" Some believe that this is a vivid summary of the technological revolution in our factory.
    This article prominently depicts how Comrade Pan Ayao, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, followed the Party's instructions, started from scratch, and, after dozens of failures, solved the problem of piercing the mandrel for seamless steel tubes together with his fellow workers. Therefore, I believe that reading this article will promote our future technological revolution. Secondly, I believe that everyone will encounter various difficulties. The difficulties that Pan Ayao encountered were great, but he resolutely overcame them. The author wrote about Old Pan's communist spirit, which sets a model for us to learn from.
    In addition, I feel that to make this article even better, some aspects need to be improved. That is: First, "Miracles are created by people" is a truth, but the people who create miracles are educated by the Party! This point is not sufficiently expressed by the author in the article. Pan Ayao created seamless steel tubes, but this was only achieved under the leadership of the Party by giving full play to his initiative and creativity. If it were before liberation, Pan Ayao would not have been able to do this at all. Second, Pan Ayao is a "red flower" in our factory, and the author wrote about this very prominently, but the depiction of the green leaves is insufficient. For example, when Old Pan proposed a solution for the mandrel method, a young worker helped him design it day and night, and it only succeeded after dozens of trials. This point is not written enough. Third, in the second paragraph, there is a passage describing Pan Ayao looking for British materials: "After that, Pan Ayao would always ask Lao Zhao as soon as he saw him at work:
    "Secretary Zhao, did you get the information?"
    "I ran to many departments..." Lao Zhao scratched his head and replied.
    "How can we rush without the information?..."
    I don't think such a dialogue helps to highlight the heroic figure of Old Pan. As far as I know, Old Pan is very active in finding information. [Originally published in "Meng Ya" (Sprout) No. 12]

### 奇迹是人创造的，人是党培养的

    奇迹是人创造的，人是党培养的
    中共永鑫无缝钢管厂支部书记　赵熙祥
    《奇迹是人创造的》（收集在《上海大跃进的一日》中）这篇特写发表以后，我们厂里很多工人都抢着看，有的说：“看了这篇文章，想想以前战斗的时候，真是越看越有劲，咱们以后还要干！”有人认为这是我厂技术革命的一篇生动的总结。
    在这篇文章中，突出地描写了在总路线光辉照耀下，潘阿耀同志遵照了党的指示，白手起家，经过了数十次的失败，和工人兄弟一起，解决了无缝钢管的顶头打洞问题。因此，我认为读了这篇文章，对我们今后的技术革命有促进作用。其次，我认为每个人总会碰到各式各样的困难，潘阿耀碰到的困难是大的，但是困难被他坚决地克服了，作者写出了老潘的共产主义的风格，就为我们树立了一个学习的榜样。
    另外，我觉得要使这篇文章写得更好，有些方面还需要改进。这就是：一、“奇迹是人创造的”这是真理，但是创造奇迹的人是党教育的呀，这一点，作者在文章里表现的是不够的。潘阿耀创造了无缝钢管，但是这只有在党的领导下，发挥了积极性和创造性后才取得的。要是在解放前，潘阿耀根本做不出这种事。二、潘阿耀是我们厂里的一朵“红花”，作者对这一点写得很突出，但是对绿叶着墨不够。比如，老潘提出解决顶头方法，有一个青工就日夜帮他设计，后来经过数十次试验才成功了，这一点却写得不够。三、在第二段里，潘阿耀为了要找英国的材料，有一段是这样描写的：“这以后，潘阿耀每天上班，一看见老赵总是劈头就问：
    “赵书记，资料弄到了吗？”
    “跑了多少单位……”老赵搔着头皮回答。
    “资料不来叫我们怎么赶？……”
    我认为这样的对话，对突出老潘这个英雄人物没有帮助，据我知道，老潘是非常积极主动去找资料的。　〔原载《萌芽》第12期〕
