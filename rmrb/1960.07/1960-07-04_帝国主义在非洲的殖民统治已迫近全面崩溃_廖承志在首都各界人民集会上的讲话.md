Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd. Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, Liao Chengzhi, delivered a speech at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital celebrating the independence of Cameroon, Togo, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, the Congo, Somalia, and the establishment of the Republic of Ghana. The full text is as follows: Comrades, friends:

	Since the beginning of this year, African countries such as Cameroon, Togo, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, the Congo, and Somalia have successively achieved independence, and Ghana, which gained independence in 1957, established a republic on July 1. This is a major victory in the development of the African national independence movement. Let us extend our warmest fraternal congratulations to the people of these countries.

	The independence of these African countries is the result of a long and tenacious struggle by the people of these countries against imperialism and colonialism. The people of Cameroon waged a four-year armed struggle against French colonial rule and are continuing to fight for the complete elimination of colonial forces. The people of the Congo have waged wave upon wave of struggles against colonial oppression and enslavement for eighty years. In particular, since last year, the Congo has continuously erupted into large-scale mass struggles against Belgian colonial rule. Despite the bloody suppression and various conspiracies of the colonialists against the Congolese people, the Congolese people have not been intimidated or deceived. On the contrary, the flames of national independence struggle have been ignited everywhere in the Congo. The tenacious struggle of the Congolese people finally forced the Belgian government to agree to the independence of the Congo on June 30 this year. The establishment of the Somali Republic is also the result of seventy years of struggle by the people there against the colonialists. The independence of Cameroon, Togo, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, the Congo, and Somalia has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and colonialism. It has not only greatly encouraged the national independence movements in other parts of Africa, but also contributed to the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Asia and Latin America and the cause of world peace for the people of the world.

	Following the independence of these countries, the Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger will declare independence in August this year. On October 1, Nigeria, one of the most populous countries in Africa, will also declare independence. Thus, by October of this year, twenty-two countries in Africa will have achieved independent status. The populations of these countries account for about three-quarters of the total population of Africa, and their area accounts for about two-thirds of the total area of Africa.

	In the situation where a large number of independent African countries have emerged successively, many regions still under colonial rule have also put forward demands for independence. At present, in Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Ruanda-Urundi, Zanzibar, Angola, etc., in vast areas of West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, and Southwest Africa, the mass struggle against colonialism and for national independence is unfolding widely and rapidly.  The South African people have never ceased their struggle against racial discrimination and for freedom. All these facts reflect that the face of Africa is undergoing tremendous and profound changes, and the African national independence movement is moving from victory to victory. The day is not far off when the great African people will once again become the masters of the entire African continent, and the complete collapse of imperialist colonial rule in Africa is approaching.

	While we celebrate the birth of newly independent African countries and the continuous victories of the African national independence movement, we should also emphasize the great contribution of the Algerian people to the struggle of the African people for national independence. The heroic Algerian people have persisted in the war of resistance for six years, hitting the French aggressors and tying down a large number of French invading troops, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the African people for national independence and creating a favorable situation. The struggle of the Algerian people has put the French colonialists in an extremely passive position, forcing them to propose negotiations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Now, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has decided to negotiate with the French government and has sent representatives to make contact with the French government. However, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has always maintained due vigilance against the French colonialists. As the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria stated in its letter to the people, "The beginning of negotiations does not mean peace. The Algerian people should continue to be at war. The National Liberation Army will continue to fight until we reach our goal," "until we obtain the right to self-determination not in words but in actions." The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Algerian people's national liberation war, and the Chinese people also support the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in using negotiations as a means to achieve independence under favorable conditions. Whether it is persisting in armed struggle or conducting negotiations, as long as it is conducive to realizing Algeria's complete independence, we will always support it.

	The vigorous development of the African national independence movement has greatly accelerated the final collapse of the imperialist colonial system. But imperialism is by no means willing to give up its colonialist policies. The closer imperialism gets to its death, the more it will engage in desperate struggles. While being forced to agree to the independence of these African countries, imperialism is doing everything possible to adopt the method of "retreating in order to advance," attempting to continue to control these countries militarily, diplomatically, and economically. It is particularly noteworthy that U.S. imperialism, wearing the cloak of "sympathy" for the independence of the African people, is infiltrating Africa on a large scale under the sweet talk of "friendly reciprocity." It has established military bases in many important strategic locations in Africa, frantically plundering the strategic resources of the African people, attempting to replace the old colonial powers such as Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal. Recently, U.S. imperialism has even conspired to establish a rocket base in Zanzibar under the guise of establishing a "scientific research and exploration station" and attempted to turn East Africa and Central Africa into U.S. hydrogen bomb bomber bases. These facts prove that U.S. imperialism is not only the number one enemy of the people of Asia and Latin America, but also the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the African national independence movement. Therefore, in order to achieve national liberation, the African people must not only continue to struggle with the old colonial powers and completely get rid of their control, but also be doubly vigilant against the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and prevent and oppose the United States from imposing new colonial shackles on themselves. In April this year, the declaration adopted by the Conakry African Solidarity Conference pointed out to the people of Asia and Africa: "We must not allow our national independence to become a target for bargaining. Our national independence must mean the most complete control of our own rich resources and potentials, and the end of foreign plunder, the end of colonial rule, and the end of poverty." This reflects the strong desire of the African people. We are pleased to see that the people of African countries that have already achieved independent status are further carrying out arduous struggles to smash imperialist conspiracies, consolidate their national independence, and completely eradicate imperialist colonial forces. We firmly believe that the African people's desire to completely get rid of colonial rule will surely be realized, and the African national independence movement will surely achieve complete victory.

	The African people's struggle for national independence is by no means isolated; it is an important part of the cause of the people all over the world against imperialism and defending world peace. With the support of the socialist camp headed

    帝国主义在非洲的殖民统治已迫近全面崩溃
    廖承志在首都各界人民集会上的讲话
    庆祝喀麦隆、多哥、马里联邦、马尔加什、刚果、 索马里独立和加纳共和国成立
    新华社3日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在首都各界人民庆祝喀麦隆、多哥、马里联邦、马尔加什、刚果、索马里独立和加纳共和国成立大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    今年以来，喀麦隆、多哥、马里联邦、马尔加什、刚果和索马里等非洲国家相继独立，于1957年取得独立地位的加纳在7月1日成立共和国。这是非洲民族独立运动发展中的重大胜利，让我们向这些国家的人民致以最热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    这些非洲国家的独立，是这些国家的人民同帝国主义、殖民主义进行了长期顽强斗争的结果。喀麦隆人民为反对法国殖民统治进行了四年的武装斗争，并正为彻底消除殖民势力而继续奋斗。刚果人民八十年来反对殖民压迫和奴役的斗争此起彼伏，连绵不断。特别是从去年起，刚果不断地爆发了声势浩大的反对比利时殖民统治的群众斗争。尽管殖民主义者对刚果人民进行了血腥镇压，玩弄种种阴谋诡计，刚果人民并没有被吓倒，也没有被欺骗，相反地，却在刚果全境到处燃起了民族独立斗争的熊熊烈火。刚果人民的顽强斗争，终于迫使比利时政府不得不同意刚果在今年6月30日独立。索马里共和国的成立，也是那里的人民同殖民主义者斗争了七十年的成果。喀麦隆、多哥、马里联邦、马尔加什、刚果和索马里的独立，沉重地打击了帝国主义和殖民主义，不仅对非洲其他地区的民族独立运动起了重大的鼓舞作用，并且对亚洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝斗争和全世界人民保卫世界和平的事业作出了贡献。
    紧跟着这些国家的独立，今年8月，象牙海岸、上伏尔特、达荷美和尼日尔将宣告独立。10月1日非洲人口最多的一个国家——尼日利亚也将宣告独立。这样，到今年10月，在非洲将有二十二个国家取得独立的地位，这些国家的人口约占非洲总人口的四分之三左右，面积约占非洲总面积的三分之二。
    在大批非洲独立国家相继出现的形势下，还处在殖民统治下的许多地区也都纷纷提出了独立的要求。目前，在尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀、乌干达、怯尼亚、卢安达—乌萨迪、桑给巴尔、安哥拉等等地方，在西非、中非、东非和西南非广大地区，反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的群众斗争正在广泛地、迅速地展开。南非人民也从未停止过反对种族歧视、争取自由的斗争。所有这些事实都反映着：非洲的面貌正在发生巨大和深刻的变化，非洲的民族独立运动正在从胜利走向胜利。伟大的非洲人民重新成为整个非洲大陆主人的日子已经不远了，帝国主义在非洲的殖民统治的全面崩溃已经日益迫近了。
    在我们庆祝非洲新独立国家诞生和非洲民族独立运动不断胜利的时候，我们还应该着重指出阿尔及利亚人民对非洲人民争取民族独立斗争所作出的巨大贡献。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民六年来坚持抗战，打击了法国侵略者，牵制了大量的法国侵略军，为非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，造成了有利的形势。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，使法国殖民者陷于极为被动的地位，不得不被迫提出要求与阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府进行谈判。现在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，已经决定同法国政府进行谈判并派遣代表同法国政府进行了接触。但是，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府对法国殖民主义者始终保持着应有的警惕。正如阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府告人民书所说，“开始进行谈判还不意味着和平。阿尔及利亚人民应该继续处于战争状态。民族解放军将继续进行斗争，直到我们达到目标”，“直到我们不是在口头上而是在行动上获得自决权为止”。中国人民从来坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，中国人民同时也支持阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在有利的条件下，把谈判作为争取独立的一种手段。不论坚持武装斗争也好，进行谈判也好，只要有利于实现阿尔及利亚的彻底独立，我们总是支持的。
    非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，大大加速了帝国主义的殖民体系的最后崩溃。但是帝国主义决不甘心放弃殖民主义政策。帝国主义愈是接近死亡，就愈要进行绝望的挣扎。帝国主义和殖民主义者在被迫同意这些非洲国家独立的同时，正千方百计地采取“以退为进”的办法，企图继续在军事上、外交上、经济上控制这些国家。特别值得注意的是，美帝国主义正披着“同情”非洲人民独立的外衣，在满口“友好互惠”的甜言蜜语下，大举渗入非洲。它在非洲许多重要战略地点建立了军事基地，疯狂地掠夺非洲人民的战略资源，企图取英、法、比、葡等老牌殖民主义的地位而代之。最近，美帝国主义更阴谋以建立“科学研究探测站”为名，在桑给巴尔建立火箭基地，并且企图把东非、中非变成美国的氢弹轰炸机基地。这些事实证明，美帝国主义不仅是亚洲、拉丁美洲人民的头号敌人，同时也是非洲民族独立运动的最凶恶、最危险的敌人。因此，非洲人民为了实现民族解放，不仅要同老牌殖民主义继续进行斗争，彻底摆脱它们的控制；而且要加倍警惕美帝国主义的阴谋活动，防止和反对美国把新的殖民枷锁强加在自己身上。今年4月，科纳克里亚非团结大会所通过的宣言向亚非各国人民指出：“决不能允许我们的民族独立成为讨价还价的目标。我们的民族独立要意味着最完全地掌握我们自己的丰富资源和潜力，并结束外国人的掠夺，结束殖民主义的统治，结束贫困”。这反映了非洲人民的强烈愿望。我们高兴地看到，已经取得独立地位的非洲国家人民正在进一步为粉碎帝国主义的阴谋，巩固自己的民族独立，和彻底铲除帝国主义殖民势力，进行艰巨的斗争。我们深信，非洲人民彻底摆脱殖民统治的愿望一定能够实现，非洲的民族独立运动一定能够取得彻底的胜利。
    非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争绝不是孤立的，它是全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的事业的一个重要组成部分。在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持下，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动继续高涨，全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴方兴未艾，以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力已经陷于空前孤立的境地。这种形势十分有利于非洲人民的斗争。尽管非洲人民在争取独立的道路上还会遇到这样或者那样的障碍，但是他们有着社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持，任何力量都决不能阻止他们前进。六亿五千万中国人民过去，现在，将来始终是非洲人民最可靠的朋友。为了反对共同的敌人，让我们永远团结在一起，互相支持，并肩前进！
