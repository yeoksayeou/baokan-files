Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 13th: Following the exposure of the US imperialists' crime of once again violating Soviet airspace with a reconnaissance plane, the Japanese Communist Party and prominent figures from all sectors have issued statements and delivered speeches, sternly condemning the aggressive actions of US imperialism and demanding the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on July 12th, stating that US RB-47 spy planes are also stationed in Japan, and demanding that these planes be withdrawn from Japan.

The statement pointed out: "As long as the Security Treaty exists, as long as the United States maintains bases and troops in Japan, and as long as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands are separated from Japan, Japan's peace and independence will not be guaranteed." The statement reiterated that the Japanese Communist Party will intensify its struggle to demand the abolition of the "Security Treaty."

Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, said that the US U-2 spy plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace undermined the Paris Four-Power Summit, and now a similar incident has occurred, which is regrettable.

Asanuma emphasized that there are reports that this type (RB-47) of plane is also stationed in Japan. He said: We will absolutely not allow the US military to use Japan as a base for espionage activities against foreign countries. We will fight to force the withdrawal of all US troops and US military bases, including all spy planes.

Asanuma said that we oppose all military alliances and demand that Japan be independent, autonomous, and actively neutral. This demand and policy are entirely legitimate.

Hidetoshi Kuroda, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out that while the United States is claiming to withdraw U-2 spy planes from Japan, another US military spy plane intrusion into the Soviet Union has occurred. This proves that the US belligerent policy has not changed and is still intensifying its pursuit of aggressive policies.

He said that Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama has already publicly declared that if Japanese bases are "attacked" from abroad, Japan will take "countermeasures" in accordance with Article 5 of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The occurrence of this US aircraft intrusion into the Soviet Union clearly tells us that there is no other way to guarantee Japan's security except to abolish the new "Security Treaty."

Kuroda emphasized that the Japanese people, uniting with the world to launch a joint struggle to force the withdrawal of US spy planes, the elimination of military bases and foreign troops, and further strive for the abolition of all military alliances, has become a current task.

Sozo Kondo, a staff member of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs living in Yamato City (where the US Atsugi Air Base is located), said that the incident of the US spy plane once again intruding into the Soviet Union and being shot down has raised the awareness of the citizens of Yamato, who realize that they must fight to the end to abolish all military bases.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 13th: Today, the Japanese Communist Party, representing 2,430,000 people who signed petitions demanding the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," submitted protest letters to the US government and the Nobusuke Kishi government, resolutely demanding the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty, the withdrawal of US troops, and the removal of US military bases.

A delegation led by Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered the protest letters to the US Embassy and the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The protest letter to the US government pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance aimed at China and the Soviet Union and oppresses the Japanese people. In the protest letter, the Japanese Communist Party demanded the abolition of this treaty, the withdrawal of US troops from Japan, and the removal of US military bases in Japan.

The protest letter to the Japanese government said that the Japanese people will never recognize the new "Security Treaty."

　　日本各界著名人士就美机再次侵犯苏联发表声明
　　只有废除日美条约才能保障日本安全
　　日共代表二百多万签名者要求撤走美军取消美军基地
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：美帝国主义侦察机又一次侵犯苏联的罪行被揭露后，日本共产党和各界著名人士纷纷发表声明和谈话，严厉谴责美帝国主义的侵略行为，并要求废除日美军事同盟条约。
    日本共产党中央干部会12日发表声明说，美国RB—47型间谍飞机也驻扎在日本，声明要求把这些飞机撤出日本。
    声明指出：“只要存在着安全条约，只要美国在日本保有基地和军队，只要冲绳岛和小笠原群岛同日本分离，日本的和平与独立就没有保障。”声明重申日本共产党将加紧要求废除“安全条约”的斗争。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎说，美国U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联的行为破坏了巴黎四国首脑会议，现在又发生性质相同的事件，这是很令人感到遗憾的。
    浅沼强调指出，有消息说，日本也驻有这一类型（RB—47型）的飞机。他说：我们绝不容许美军把日本用作对外国进行间谍活动的基地，我们将为迫使撤销包括一切间谍飞机在内的所有美军和美军基地而斗争。
    浅沼说，我们反对一切军事同盟，要求日本独立自主和积极中立，这种要求和政策是完全正当的。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局长黑田英俊指出，正在美国声称从日本撤走U—2型间谍飞机的时候，又发生了另一种美军间谍飞机侵犯苏联事件，这证明，美国好战政策并没有改变，而且还在加强推行侵略政策。
    他说，日本外务相藤山爱一郎已经公开宣称日本基地遭到来自外国的“攻击”时，日本将根据新日美“安全条约”第五条采取“对付”措施。这次美国飞机侵犯苏联事件的发生清楚地告诉我们，除了废除新“安全条约”以外没有别的途径能够保障日本的安全。
    黑田强调指出，日本人民同全世界联合起来展开共同斗争，迫使撤走美国间谍飞机，撤销军事基地和外国军队，进一步争取废除一切军事同盟，这已经成为当前的课题。
    住在大和市（当地有美国空军厚木基地）的日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会工作人员近藤创说，美国间谍飞机又一次侵犯苏联并被击落的事件使大和市民提高了觉悟，认识到一定要为撤销一切军事基地而斗争到底。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天代表二百四十三万个签名要求废除新日美“安全条约”的日本人民向美国政府和岸信介政府提出抗议书，坚决要求废除日美军事同盟条约，撤走美国军队和撤除美军基地。
    日本共产党中央干部会委员志贺义雄率领的代表团把抗议书交给了美国大使馆和岸信介政府。
    致美国政府的抗议书指出，新“安全条约”是针对中国和苏联的、是压迫日本人民的侵略性军事同盟。日本共产党在抗议书中要求废除这个条约，要求美军撤出日本和撤除在日本的美国军事基地。
    致日本政府的抗议书说，日本人民决不承认新“安全条约”。
