Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 10th: Joint struggle organizations of people from all walks of life in Japan are deeply uniting the people and carrying out the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    A recent issue of the "Japan News Weekly" wrote that joint struggle organizations against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" now exist in almost every corner of Japan. They demonstrate the unity of the Japanese people and the great achievements made by the Japanese people's staunch struggle.

    The weekly said that these organizations organize large-scale demonstrations and rallies in various places. When workers held a general strike in June, they mobilized people from broad strata such as farmers, students, scholars, and businesspeople to support the general strike.

    In Gunma Prefecture, where the struggle against the "Security Treaty" is very active, all 130 branches of the "Gunma Prefectural Federation for the Protection of Democracy" are actively discussing how to gather greater strength to crush the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." In the past, it led local people in patriotic struggles against U.S. military bases and against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Now, it has become a permanent joint struggle organization.

    In Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan, the joint struggle conference against the "Security Treaty" is preparing for a long-term struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. Three hundred joint struggle organizations have been established in cities, towns, villages, and some schools in this prefecture. They are also working hard to develop into permanent organizations. These organizations are also actively discussing how to achieve peace and neutrality for Japan. For example, after discussions, the joint struggle organization in Omuta City put forward the new slogan: "Americans get out of Asia!"

    According to the weekly, joint struggle organizations in various places are striving to mobilize more farmers to actively participate in the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    For example, in Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan, trade union members of the joint struggle organization enthusiastically explained to farmers and fishermen the disasters caused to them by the U.S.-Japan monopoly capital's policy of promoting the revival of militarism.

    Members of the joint struggle organizations in Niigata and Nagano Prefectures in central Japan, together with farmers, demanded that the government raise rice purchase prices, thereby continuously increasing the number of farmers participating in the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    Teachers and workers of the joint struggle organization in Kochi Prefecture hold small-scale evening talks with farmers every night to explain to them why the government purchases farmers' rice at such a low price, what imperialism is, and why there is a danger of war, etc., calling on farmers to form farmers' associations and participate in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. The in-depth enlightenment and propaganda work of the workers has produced significant results.

    The meeting of representatives of joint struggle organizations from various places held in Tokyo on June 28 reflected the high fighting spirit and demands of the people in various places. The weekly said that representatives of joint struggle organizations in various places emphasized: "We must not give the enemy a chance to breathe and must pursue them relentlessly." They advocated: developing the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" into a struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty," actively launching a propaganda campaign so that the broad masses of people not only recognize the need to oppose domestic monopoly capitalists and the Kishi Nobusuke government, but also to oppose U.S. imperialism. The representatives also advocated: further developing the joint struggle between workers, farmers, and other strata of people according to the specific circumstances of various places.

　　在反美爱国斗争中日益加强团结
　　日本人民共同斗争组织遍布全国
　　各地组织广泛动员工农学商积极参加示威和集会
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本各地人民的共同斗争组织正在深入地团结着各界人民，进行反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    最近一期的“日本新闻周报”写道，现在，反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织几乎遍布日本全国的每个角落。它们表现着日本人民的团结和日本人民的坚强斗争所取得的巨大成果。
    周报说，这些组织在各地组织规模浩大的示威和集会。当工人在6月举行总罢工时，它们动员农民、学生、学者、商人等广泛阶层的人民支持总罢工。
    在反对“安全条约”斗争进行得十分活跃的群马县，“群马县民拥护民主联合会”的一百三十个分会，全部都在积极讨论如何集结更大的力量，来粉碎新日美“安全条约”。过去，它曾经领导当地人民展开了反对美军基地、反对修改“警察官职务执行法”等爱国斗争。现在，它已经变成永久性的联合斗争组织。
    在日本南部的福冈县，反对“安全条约”共同斗争会议正在准备进行长期的斗争来反对日美军事同盟。在这个县的市、镇、村以及一些学校里，已经成立了三百个共同斗争组织。它们也都在为发展成为永久性组织而努力。这些组织还在热烈地讨论如何使日本实现和平中立。例如，大牟田市的共同斗争组织经过讨论后，提出了“美国滚出亚洲！”的新口号。
    据周报报道，各地的共同斗争组织正在努力动员更多的农民积极参加反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    例如，在日本最北部的北海道，共同斗争组织的工会会员热情地向农民和渔民们说明，美日垄断资本推行复活军国主义的政策对他们所造成的灾害。
    日本中部的新澙县和长野县的共同斗争组织的成员，同农民一起要求政府提高大米收购价格，从而使得参加反对
  “安全条约”斗争的农民人数不断增加。
    高知县的共同斗争组织的教职员、工人，每天晚上同农民举行小型谈话会，向农民说明为什么政府收购农民大米的价格这样低，什么是帝国主义，为什么会存在战争的危险等，呼吁农民成立农民协会，参加反对日美军事同盟的斗争。工人们深入的启蒙宣传工作，已经产生了显著的效果。
    6月28日在东京举行的各地共同斗争组织代表会议反映了各地人民高昂的斗志和要求。周报说，各地共同斗争组织代表都强调：“不能给敌人以喘息机会，必须对它们进行不懈的追击”。他们主张：把反对批准新“安全条约”的斗争发展为废除新“安全条约”的斗争，积极展开宣传运动，使广大人民不仅认识到要反对国内的垄断资本家和岸信介政府，而且要反对美帝国主义。代表们还主张：根据各地具体情况，进一步发展工人、农民和其他阶层人民之间的联合斗争。
