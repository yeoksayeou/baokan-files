Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: The Daxing County Party Committee has established a rice "command field," with leading cadres moving to the fields to work and directing operations on-site, effectively promoting the production of 200,000 mu of rice paddies across the county.

Most of the land within Daxing County, which is under the jurisdiction of Beijing, is sandy alkaline depression, prone to flooding nine years out of ten. Since liberation, the Party has led the people of the county in digging canals, sinking wells, constructing water conservancy projects, and transforming alkaline depressions into rice paddies. Before last winter, the county had already converted 38,000 mu of alkaline depressions into rice paddies. Last winter, the communes extensively built water conservancy projects, expanding the rice paddies to 200,000 mu in one fell swoop. Because most areas had not grown rice before, there was a lack of experience and technology, so many problems were encountered in terms of manpower, materials, and cultivation techniques. In order to strengthen specific guidance and adapt to the new situation of continued leaps forward in agricultural production, the County Party Committee designated the 30,000 mu of alkaline depression land in Sun Village, Fa Shang, and Wei Shanzhuang brigades as a "command field." A command post was established locally, headed by a County Party Secretary, with a Standing Committee member leading administrative cadres and technical cadres to settle down and take root for a long time, combining with farmers to explore experiences and direct rice production throughout the county.

This base point has already played a huge role in guiding rice production throughout the county. Leading cadres are permanently rooted in the command field and when necessary they gather the technical force and experienced farmers from the whole county to tackle a production key point with all their strength. They listen extensively to the opinions of the masses, conduct on-site experiments, and solve key production problems in a timely manner. In March this year, when the communes began to sow rice, they found that there was not enough windbreak material, which seriously affected early seedling cultivation. Initially, the leadership considered building earthen walls to block the wind and keep warm, but they were not sure. The command post consulted with experienced farmers and technicians to study the advantages and disadvantages in detail. They believed that building earthen walls was both labor-intensive and land-consuming, and proposed a method of dry sowing and water covering, using horse manure and cooked soil to keep warm. After testing, it proved to be feasible. Therefore, the county-wide on-site meeting was held in the command field, and each commune learned this method, which not only enabled early sowing and seedling cultivation but also solved the problem of insufficient windbreak materials. Now, when the communes encounter difficult problems, they often come here to learn from experience.

This 30,000-mu command field is also a red and expert school for training cadres and imparting technology. When solving each key problem in rice production, the command post first gathers experienced "local experts" and technicians to repeatedly discuss and formulate measures, and the command field takes the first step to create a "model." Then, it convenes a county-wide four-level cadre meeting in the field, adopting the method of listening, watching, and doing, to practice military skills and train soldiers on the spot. This leadership method of going straight to the grassroots is very popular among the vast number of grassroots cadres. They said, "The command field is very good. By holding an on-site meeting here, we can both understand the spirit and obtain treasures. We don't need to hold meetings at every level to convey the message, and the efficiency of guiding production is high."

Under the impetus of the command field, the communes have established red and expert night schools and carried out mass political, cultural, and technical learning activities. Closely linked to current production, they learn what they do, study in the evening, discuss in the fields during the day, and apply what they learn in the fields, which is very effective. The 30,000-mu command field has already achieved one technician per 100 mu and one "local expert" per 1,000 mu; many young people and women have initially mastered the techniques of soaking seeds, cultivating seedlings, managing seedling beds, and operating rice transplanters, and they can talk about it logically and systematically.

### 大兴县委加强新水稻区生产领导  在碱洼地建立三万亩指挥田

    大兴县委加强新水稻区生产领导
    在碱洼地建立三万亩指挥田
    新华社3日讯　中共大兴县委建立水稻指挥田，领导干部搬到地头办公，深入现场指挥，有力地推动了全县二十万亩稻田的生产工作。
    北京市属大兴县境内大部分土地是沙岗碱洼，十年九涝。解放以来，党领导全县人民，开渠打井，兴修水利，改碱洼为稻田。去冬以前全县已在碱洼地上搞成稻田三万八千亩。去冬，各公社大修水利，一举把稻田扩大到二十万亩。由于大部分地方过去没有种过水稻，一无经验，二无技术，所以在人力物力和耕作技术上，遇到很多问题。为了加强具体指导，适应农业生产继续跃进的新形势，县委便把孙村、垡上和魏善庄三个大队连片的三万亩碱洼地，作为指挥田。在当地设立指挥部，由一名县委书记挂帅，一名常委委员率领行政干部和技术干部长期蹲点扎根，和农民结合，摸索经验，指挥全县水稻生产。
    这个基点，在指导全县水稻生产中已经发挥了巨大作用。领导干部在指挥田里长期扎根，必要时集中全县的技术力量和有经验的老农，全力围攻一个生产关键，广泛地听取群众的意见，就地作试验，及时地解决了生产上的关键问题。今年3月各公社开始播种水稻时，发现风障材料不够，严重影响提前育苗。最初，领导上考虑打土墙挡风保温，可是没有把握。指挥部便找老农和技术员详细研究，分析利弊，认为打土墙既费工，又占地，提出了旱播水盖，用马粪和熟土保温的办法育苗，经过试验，确实可行。于是便在指挥田召开了全县的现场会，各公社都学会了这种作法，既能提早播种育苗，又解决了风障材料不足的问题。现在，各公社遇到疑难问题时，也常到这里取经。
    这三万亩指挥田，又是训练干部、传授技术的红专学校。在解决水稻生产中的每一个关键问题时，指挥部事先都召集有经验的“土专家”和技术员反复讨论，制订措施，由指挥田先走一步，作出“样板”，然后召集全县四级干部会师田间，采取又听又看又干的办法，当场习武练兵，这种一竿子扎到底的领导方法，深受广大基层干部欢迎。他们说：“指挥田，就是好，在这里开一次现场会，既领会精神又取了宝，再不用层层开会去传达，指导生产效率高。”
    在指挥田的带动下，各公社都办起了红专夜校，开展了群众性的政治、文化和技术学习活动。紧密结合当前生产，干什么学什么，晚上学习，白天在地头讨论，在田间运用，收效极快。三万亩指挥田已经做到了百亩有个技术员，千亩有个“土专家”；不少青年和妇女都初步掌握了浸种、育秧、管理秧畦、操作插秧机等技术，而且谈起来有条有理，头头是道。
