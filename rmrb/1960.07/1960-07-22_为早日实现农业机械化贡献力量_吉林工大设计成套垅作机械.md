    Contributing to the Early Realization of Agricultural Mechanization
    Jilin University of Technology Designs Complete Set of Ridge Tillage Machinery
    (Our Dispatch) The faculty and students of the Agricultural Machinery Department of Jilin University of Technology, in collaboration with the staff of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, have designed and trial-produced a complete set of ridge tillage machinery suitable for the agricultural ridge tillage characteristics of the Northeast region. After field trials and appraisals, it has been proven to meet the special requirements of ridge tillage and has good performance.
    Farmers in the Northeast region have long been accustomed to using ridge tillage for cultivation, with ridges and furrows on the ground, which is conducive to heat preservation and moisture retention. However, the general agricultural machinery currently popular in China is all for flat tillage, which is not suitable for ridge tillage requirements. In order to realize agricultural mechanization in the Northeast region as soon as possible, it is necessary to vigorously design and manufacture agricultural machinery suitable for the characteristics of ridge tillage. As early as the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Agricultural Machinery Department of Jilin University of Technology, under the direction of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, collaborated with the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute to begin designing and trial-producing ridge tillage machinery.
    Over the past two years, the faculty and students of the Agricultural Machinery Department and the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute have designed and trial-produced more than a dozen types of ridge tillage machinery, including ridging, sowing, inter-tillage, and harvesting machinery. After hundreds of repeated design modifications and experiments, these include the universal precision seeder, the universal ridging, inter-tillage, and fertilizer application machine, the high-stalk crop swather, the corn harvester, the millet and soybean swather, and the OK-(3) combine harvester. After field trials, some have been initially finalized, and others have also proven to have basically good performance and can be put into production after modification.
    While designing and trial-producing a complete set of ridge tillage machinery, the faculty and students of the Agricultural Machinery Department, in conjunction with course design and graduation design, have also completed dozens of agricultural machinery design and reform projects.

    为早日实现农业机械化贡献力量 
    吉林工大设计成套垅作机械
    本报讯　吉林工业大学农业机械系师生和吉林省农业机械研究所职工协作，设计和试制出成套适合东北地区农业垅作特点的垅作机械，经过田间试验鉴定，证明符合垅作特殊要求，性能良好。
    东北地区农民群众长期习惯采用垅作耕种，地面有垅有沟，便于保温保墒。但目前我国流行的一般农业机械均系平作，不适合垅作要求。为了早日实现东北地区农业机械化，需要大力设计和制造适合垅作特点的农业机械。早在大跃进的1958年，吉林工业大学农业机械系就根据中共吉林省委的指示，和吉林省农业机械研究所协作，开始设计和试制垅作机械。
    两年来，农业机械系师生和省农业机械研究所前后共设计出起垅、播种、中耕和收割等十几种垅 作机械，经过上百次的反复修改设计和试验，其中有万能精密播种机、万能起垅中耕施肥机、高秆作物割晒机、玉米收割机、谷子大豆割晒机和OK—（3）康拜因机等，经过田间试验，有的已初步定型，有的也已证明性能基本良好，经过修改后即可投入生产。
    农业机械系师生在设计和试制成套垅作机械的同时，结合课程设计和毕业设计，还先后完成了几十种农业机械设计和改革项目。
