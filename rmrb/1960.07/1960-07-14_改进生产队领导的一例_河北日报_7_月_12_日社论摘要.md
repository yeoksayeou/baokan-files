　　An Example of Improving Production Team Leadership
　　Abstract of *Hebei Daily* Editorial of July 12th

　　The Party's grassroots cadres are the bridge connecting the Party and the masses, and the specific implementers of the Party's line, principles, and policies. The Party concentrates the opinions and demands of the people through them, using them as the basis for formulating lines, principles, and policies; the Party then disseminates the line, principles, and policies to the masses through them. Grassroots cadres are also the direct leaders and organizers of the masses' production and life. At present, the new situation of continuous leaps forward in various construction undertakings has placed higher demands on grassroots cadres, and their burdens are heavier. Zheng Gong Production Team of Xing'an Commune in Gaocheng County, with reference to the spirit of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, has formulated a "Five-Character Work Method." This has emerged in response to the needs of the new situation. It points out the correct direction for production team cadres to delve into work, participate in labor and study, and continuously improve their leadership skills.

　　The proposal of the "Study, Do, Meet, Shift, Help" Five-Character Work Method is a manifestation of applying Mao Zedong Thought to solve the problem of working methods. It has been developed on the basis of production team cadres participating in labor, engaging in "experimental plots," dividing up responsibility for teams, and holding field consultations over the past few years. It is also a revolutionary measure to adapt to the situation of the county, commune, and management district levels promoting the "Two-Five System" and improve the leadership of production teams. It combines study and practice, participating in production and directing production, staying at a point and shifting to a wider area, and makes it systematic, so that grassroots cadres can break away from being entangled in affairs, concentrate their main time and energy on studying and solving key problems, achieve "finding problems before noon and solving them overnight," and promote the continuous progress of various tasks. The practice of many production teams in Gaocheng County in implementing the "Five-Character Work Method" proves that this method, which involves learning, doing, going up and down, meeting in a timely manner, conducting on-the-spot research, discussing with evidence, and interlinking each step, is suitable for the actual needs of grassroots work and is welcomed by the broad masses.

　　The "Five-Character Work Method," like the "Two-Five System" leadership method, is a means, not an end. Our purpose is to delve into work, delve into the masses, and promote the continuous leap forward in production. The Study, Do, Meet, Shift, and Help of the "Five-Character Work Method" are interconnected and mutually restrictive, among which the three characters Study, Do, and Help are particularly worthy of mention, as they are the core and main body of the "Five Characters." The so-called "Study" mainly refers to studying Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's guidelines and policies. It should be admitted that our grassroots cadres have rich practical experience, but their general policy and theoretical level is not high, and some are very low. Therefore, they still show blindness and passivity in their work, which affects them from doing their work better. The fundamental way to solve this problem is to improve their theoretical and policy level and improve their ability to analyze things. By doing so, they can always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and improve their consciousness and initiative. In the past, the study of production team cadres was often squeezed out by various affairs because there was no institutional guarantee. Experience has shown that to do a good job in the study of grassroots cadres, it is necessary to properly resolve the contradiction between study and production and work. The implementation of the "Five-Character Work Method" provides extremely favorable conditions in this regard. The so-called "Do" means being among the masses, participating in production, and leading production. Only by participating in production can we understand the most practical situation and make our work plans and leadership intentions conform to the objective situation and the requirements of the masses. This is also a source of learning from the masses and acquiring knowledge. The so-called "Help" is to study, analyze, and summarize the problems encountered in practice in a timely manner and solve them, and to help team cadres more in offering ideas and finding solutions to overcome the difficulties in their work, instead of accumulating problems into knots and then dealing with them. "Shift" and "Meet" are also for the sake of studying well and helping well. The "Five-Character Work Method" will enable the working method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" to be specifically implemented, and the political and ideological level and working ability of team cadres will be continuously improved.

　　The "Five-Character Work Method" is a very good leadership method, but no new thing can be perfect from the beginning. Localities should creatively apply it in the process of implementation, constantly develop this experience, and constantly enrich this experience, so that it becomes a more practical and complete leadership method.

### 改进生产队领导的一例　河北日报7月12日社论摘要

　　改进生产队领导的一例
　　河北日报7月12日社论摘要
    党的基层干部是党联系人民群众的桥梁，是党的路线、方针、政策的具体执行者。党通过他们把人民群众的意见、要求集中起来，作为制定路线、方针、政策的依据；党又通过他们把路线、方针、政策贯彻到群众中去。基层干部又是群众生产、生活的直接领导者和组织者。目前，各项建设事业持续跃进的新形势，对基层干部提出了更高的要求，他们的担子更重了。藁城县兴安公社正公生产队参照“二五制”领导方法的精神，制定了“五字工作法”。这是适应新形势的需要而产生的。它为生产队干部深入工作、参加劳动和学习，不断提高领导水平，指出了正确的方向。
    “学、干、碰、转、帮”五字工作法的提出，是应用毛泽东思想解决工作方法问题的体现，是在几年来生产队干部参加劳动，搞“试验田”，分工包队，田间会诊等基础上发展起来的，也是适应县、公社、管理区三级推行“二五制”的形势、改进生产队领导的革命措施。它把学习与实践，参加生产与指挥生产，蹲点与转面等很好地结合了起来，并使之制度化，从而使基层干部摆脱事务纠缠，集中主要时间和精力研究和解决关键性的问题，达到“发现问题不过晌，解决问题不过夜”，推动各项工作不断前进。藁城县许多生产队推行“五字工作法”的实践证明，这种有学有干，有上有下，及时碰头，就地研究，议而有据，环环相扣的办法，是适合基层工作的实际需要的，是广大群众欢迎的。
      “五字工作法”和“二五制”领导方法一样，是手段，而不是目的，我们的目的是为了深入工作，深入群众，推动生产持续跃进。“五字工作法”的学、干、碰、转、帮，是互相联系互相制约的，其中值得特别提出的是学、干、帮三个字，这是“五字”中的核心和主体。所谓“学”，主要是学习毛泽东思想和党的方针政策。应当承认，我们的基层干部有丰富的实际经验，但是一般政策理论水平不高，有的很低，因而工作中还表现有盲目性和被动性，影响着把工作做得更好。解决这个问题的根本办法，就是提高理论水平和政策水平，提高分析事物的能力，这样做了，才能永远保持旺盛的革命干劲，提高自觉性和主动性。过去，生产队干部的学习，因为没有制度上的保障，常常为这样那样的事务所挤掉。经验证明，要搞好基层干部的学习，必须妥善解决学习和生产、工作的矛盾。“五字工作法”的推行，在这方面提供了极为有利的条件。所谓“干”，就是置身于群众之中，参加生产领导生产。只有参加生产，才能了解到最实际的情况，使自己的工作计划、领导意图符合客观情况，符合群众的要求。这也是向群众学习取得知识的源泉。所谓“帮”，就是把实践中遇到的问题，经过研究、分析、总结，及时加以解决，多帮助小队干部出主意想办法，克服工作中的困难，而不把问题集成疙瘩再处理。“转”和“碰”也都是为了“学”好“帮”好。“五字工作法”将使“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法得到具体贯彻，使队干部的政治思想水平和工作能力不断提高。
      “五字工作法”是一个很好的领导方法，但是，任何新生事物都不可能一开始就完善无缺，各地在推行中应该创造性地运用，不断发展这一经验，不断丰富这一经验，使它成为一套更符合实际的完整的领导方法。
