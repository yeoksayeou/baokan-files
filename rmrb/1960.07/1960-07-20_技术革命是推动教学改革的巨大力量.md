    The Technological Revolution is a Great Force for Promoting Teaching Reform
    The Communist Party Committee of Dalian Institute of Technology

    Under the leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Luda Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, Dalian Institute of Technology has actively participated in the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement since the end of last year. The institute has sent more than 2,000 teachers and students to more than 100 factories, enterprises, and rural people's communes in Luda, Anshan, Changchun, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to support the technological innovation and technological revolution in industry and agriculture. A total of 571 major projects were completed, contributing to the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, technological innovation and technological revolution movements were also carried out in the institute's factories, farms, laboratories, classrooms, canteens, nurseries, and other places. Since May of this year, the entire institute has been mobilized to vigorously promote gasification and electrified teaching, and significant results have also been achieved. Many factories and laboratories have undergone a revolution every few days, or even twice in three days, greatly improving production efficiency, accelerating the progress of scientific research, and creating many scientific and technological achievements of great significance.

    Comrade Lu Dingyi said in his report "Teaching Must Be Reformed": "We hope that all higher schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine will become schools of technological revolution." From the practice of our institute's participation in the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the past few months, we have deeply realized that this statement is extremely important, and it correctly points out the direction of future development of higher industrial schools. The participation of teachers and students of higher industrial schools in technological innovation and technological revolution can not only make direct contributions to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and achieve a double harvest of redness and expertise, but also have extremely beneficial and far-reaching impacts on teaching reform. Practice has proved that the technological revolution is a great force for promoting teaching reform in universities.

    First of all, in the movement to participate in the technological revolution, the serious phenomena of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching are sharply exposed, making the majority of teachers and students more deeply aware that teaching must be reformed. Before participating in the technological revolution, many people did not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of teaching reform in universities, believing that teaching reform was only a matter for primary and secondary schools and had nothing to do with universities. After participating in the technological revolution, the majority of teachers and students personally witnessed the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the rapid progress of science and technology, and personally experienced that the current phenomena of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching are seriously incompatible with the development of production and the progress of science and technology. Therefore, thorough reform must be carried out.

    On the basis of participating in the technological revolution, our institute mobilized teachers and students to expose the problems existing in teaching. From the large number of facts that have been exposed and revealed, it can be seen that the phenomena of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching are serious.

    In the teaching system, there are many phenomena of repetition, triviality, isolation, and fragmentation, specifically manifested in the excessive number of courses. The general professional education plans of our institute have about thirty courses. According to preliminary investigation and research, some courses are completely unnecessary or mostly unnecessary, and some courses can be merged. For example, the heat engineering course for the foundry major takes more than seventy hours, but only more than ten hours are useful for the foundry major. In order to use a part of it, a whole course is offered. The bad consequences caused by too many courses are: (1) unnecessary repetition, wasting time; (2) splitting knowledge that is originally interconnected into isolated and fragmented things, making it impossible for students to comprehensively master and apply it. For example, the professional courses for the foundry major are as many as nine. Among them, the four courses of foundry principle, cast iron science, cast steel science, and non-ferrous metal casting could originally be combined into one course, "Foundry Alloy and Smelting Science," which would only require 104 class hours. However, in order to take care of the characteristics and division of labor of teachers, they are divided into the above four courses, so each course has to establish a system, and each course cannot be completed without dozens of hours, so the total class hours increase to 199 hours, with a lot of unnecessary repetition of content. For example, in the mechanical manufacturing major, the same gear principle is repeated in five courses, which not only wastes time but also fails to explain it thoroughly.

    In terms of teaching content, the phenomena of being outdated, backward, and divorced from reality are also serious. In the upsurge of the technological revolution, a large number of inventions and creations have emerged; some scientific knowledge that was originally considered unattainable has quickly become popular among workers and is widely used in production, but the teaching content has not reflected this, or has reflected it very little, and still teaches those old things that are no longer used or rarely used in production. For example, in heat engines, a lot of time is still spent on the reciprocating steam engine of the 18th century, which is still regarded as the focus of exams. The hydrogen sulfide system in analytical chemistry is also very old and outdated and is basically not used in modern experiments, but teachers still spend a lot of time teaching these things to students. The situation of chemical engineering courses is particularly prominent. In the technological revolution movement, many new technologies in chemical engineering have emerged, and the process equipment of many factories has changed. As a result, many professional courses in chemical engineering are like the situation faced by agricultural schools in 1958 when faced with the great leap forward in agricultural technology, where it was impossible to continue teaching in the classroom. Now, it is necessary to abandon the original textbooks, go to production to learn, and rebuild new teaching content. According to the preliminary results of the reform, the original 154 hours of content of the chemical engineering principle course, after the technological revolution, only 50 hours are useful. The rest must be increased with new content of the technological revolution. The outdated and backward nature of some experimental courses and their detachment from reality are even more serious. For example, in the physics experiment class, many experiments are inherited from classical physics, and the content is very poor, very simple, and very boring. Some experiments are inaccurate and inefficient due to the old instruments and equipment, which not only wastes time but also hinders the students' creative performance and makes students uninterested in the experiment class.

    There are also serious problems in teaching methods. Many courses are a list of phenomena and an accumulation of materials. Teachers are not good at helping students grasp scientific laws through in-depth explanations of typical problems, but simply and directly introduce a large amount of material to students in isolation. For example, the organic chemistry course has always listed various organic substances from name to properties for students, making students feel boring and difficult to remember, and it is called the "Organic Dictionary"; the machine tool course also simply and directly introduces various machine tools to students, and students call it the "Product Introduction." There is also a phenomenon of detachment from reality and sticking to conventions in teaching methods. Teachers are always limited to the classroom, using a blackboard and a few charts for teaching. In fact, students can quickly accept and master many problems by looking at the site. Spending a lot of time in the classroom just with a blackboard and charts is not clear.

    More seriously, a small number of teachers are content with "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," oppose "more, faster, better, and more economical"; "respect theory only, mathematics supreme"; promote the individual role of scientists, oppose historical materialism; and spread a series of bourgeois reactionary ideas such as metaphysics and agnosticism. For example, some people say: Rice can only be eaten one bite at a time, and learning cannot leap forward. Some teachers said to students that only what can be proved by mathematics can be believed. Some teachers even tried to use the limit principle of mathematics to prove that socialist construction does not necessarily have to be built at high speed. Some teachers attributed the development of organic synthesis to the aggressive war launched by fascist Germany. The above are just the problems initially exposed in the teaching reform of our institute. After participating in the technological revolution, the vast majority of teachers and students felt that they could no longer teach or learn according to the original curriculum system, teaching content, and teaching methods. They were educated by a large number of irrefutable facts and realized the necessity and urgency of teaching reform, thus preparing better ideological conditions for teaching reform.

    Secondly, participating in the technological revolution also provides the direction and specific ways for teaching reform. Our teaching reform must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, implement the Party's general line for building socialism and the Party's education policy, reverse the phenomena of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," and implement the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," which is very clear. However, for higher schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, what should be reformed in the teaching system, teaching content, and teaching methods, and how to carry out the reform, this requires seeking answers from technological innovation and technological revolution. Natural science is the generalization and summary of the experience of the struggle for production. Without the practice of the struggle for production, natural science cannot develop. By the same token, without participating in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the teaching of natural science cannot be truly reformed. After several months of participating in the practice of the technological revolution, we have initially found a way to reform the teaching of higher industrial schools. We believe that in carrying out teaching reform, the innovation of teaching content should be combined with the reform of the teaching system. Before the teaching system is reformed, we should actively innovate the teaching content. However, in order to make teaching more, faster, better, and more economical, it is not enough to innovate the content of one course after another, and it is also necessary to solve the fundamental reform of the teaching system. To solve this problem, we must participate in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The goal of reforming the curriculum content is to "eliminate the old, increase the new, improve, and make it useful." For example, the teachers and students of the physics experiment class have compiled a new set of textbooks, changing the past outdated and backward situation that was divorced from reality. Its characteristics are that it is closely integrated with production and scientific research, fully reflects cutting-edge science and technology, and can cultivate students' creativity and independent working ability. The reformed physics experiment class includes ten major new technologies: basic measurement, electromagnetic measurement, optical measurement, vacuum technology, radio technology, X-ray technology, ultrasonic technology, spectral analysis technology, semiconductor application, and radioactive measurement, which greatly improves the level and quality of the physics experiment class. The goal of teaching system reform is to appropriately improve the level, appropriately control class hours, and appropriately increase labor. The teachers and fourth-year students of the mechanical manufacturing major proposed a new professional course teaching plan after participating in the technological revolution. According to this plan, it is possible to complete eight professional courses that originally took more than a year to complete in three months, and it is possible to improve the quality and free up a whole year of the fifth grade for scientific research. The characteristic of this plan is to take on-site teaching as the main form of professional course teaching, fully implement the principle of "practice - theory - practice," and adopt the method of dissecting sparrows and using typical examples to drive the general. After the trial in the previous stage, the effect has proved to be good.

    Participating in the technological revolution can also improve the level of teachers and students at high speed and prepare the necessary material conditions for teaching reform. The purpose of our teaching reform is to improve the teaching level and teaching quality. The process of teaching reform should be a process of continuous improvement of teaching level and teaching quality. Therefore, the improvement of the level of teachers and students is a necessary material condition for the successful teaching reform. Participating in the technological revolution is an important way to improve the level of teachers and students. One of the important characteristics of this mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement is its high degree of scientificity. Many inventions and creations that have emerged in the movement have used the latest science and technology, some of which have far exceeded the scope of existing book knowledge, and some of which are closely integrated with the research of cutting-edge science and technology. The teachers and students of our institute have greatly improved their professional skills in the process of participating in the technological revolution. For example, some teachers and students of the mechanical manufacturing major of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of our institute helped the factory design many kinds of program-controlled machine tools, and some teachers and students of the industrial enterprise electrification and automation major of the Department of Automatic Control helped the factory design automatic control devices for ball mill feeding and automatic control devices for boiler combustion. These are all applications of the latest science and technology, some of which are not in the books, and the teachers did not know them before. Under the leadership of the Party, they learned and mastered the application of these latest scientific knowledge through learning while doing, combining with workers, and collective discussion and research, which cannot be achieved by closed-door teaching. Because the level of teachers has been improved, it has created favorable conditions for teaching reform.

    Participating in the technological revolution also helped teachers and students break superstitions, liberate their minds, boldly innovate and create in teaching. They were greatly encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm and daring communist style of the working class in the factories. When they returned to the school to participate in teaching reform, it was easier to break through old conventions and boldly establish new teaching systems, teaching content, and teaching methods.

    Based on the experience of participating in the technological revolution and carrying out teaching reform in the past few months, we have realized that higher education institutions must simultaneously promote both on-campus and off-campus activities when participating in the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement. On the one hand, we must strengthen the cooperation between schools and factories and people's communes and actively support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. On the other hand, we must vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution on campus and equip the school with new science and technology. Only in this way can we be called a "school of technological revolution." In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, we should insist that teachers and students participate in labor and closely integrate with workers. In the teaching reform movement, we should closely combine ideological revolution with teaching reform, criticize bourgeois educational thought, and establish proletarian educational thought; combine the innovation of teaching content with the reform of the teaching system; and combine destruction and construction, destroying and building at the same time. In the process of teaching reform, we must strengthen basic courses and improve teaching quality, and we must not weaken basic courses and reduce teaching quality. To do a good job in technological revolution and teaching reform, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously carry out mass movements.

    Our Dalian Institute of Technology must become a school of technological revolution, continuously participate in the technological revolution, continuously reform teaching, and continuously improve teaching quality in the future, so as to better train socialist-minded and professionally proficient intellectuals of the working class for the country.

    技术革命是推动教学改革的巨大力量
　　中共大连工学院委员会
    大连工学院在中共辽宁省委和旅大市委的领导下，从去年年底以来，积极地参加了全民的技术革新和技术革命运动。全院先后派出了两千多名师生，分赴旅大、鞍山、长春、北京、上海等地一百多个工厂企业和农村人民公社，支援工农业的技术革新和技术革命，共完成重大项目五百七十一个，对工农业生产的继续跃进，贡献了自己的一份力量。与此同时，在院所属的工厂、农场、实验室、教室以及伙房、托儿所等处，也开展了技术革新与技术革命运动，今年5月以来，又发动全院人员，大搞煤气化及电化教学，同样取得了重大的成果。不少工厂和实验室，几天之内革了一次命，甚至三天之内革了二次命，使生产效率大大提高、科学研究的进度大大加快，并创造出不少具有重大意义的科学技术成果。
    陆定一同志在“教学必须改革”的报告中说：“我们希望一切理工农医的高等学校，都成为技术革命的学校。”从几个月来我院参加全民的技术革新与技术革命运动的实践中，我们深刻地体会到这个提法是极为重要的，他正确地说明了高等工业学校今后发展的方向。高等工业学校师生参加技术革新与技术革命，不仅可以对工农业生产的大跃进作出直接的贡献，可以获得红专双丰收，而且可以对教学改革发生极为有利的和深远的影响。实践证明，技术革命是推动高等学校教学改革的巨大力量。
    首先，在参加技术革命的运动中，尖锐地暴露出教学中存在着的严重的少慢差费现象，使广大师生更加深刻地认识到，教学必须改革。在参加技术革命以前，许多人对于高等学校教学改革的必要性认识不足，认为教学改革只是中、小学的事，与大学无关。参加技术革命以后，广大师生员工亲自看到工农业生产的飞跃发展和科学技术日新夜异的进步，切身体会到目前在教学上存在着严重的少慢差费的现象，同生产发展和科学技术的进步不相适应，因此必须进行彻底的改革。
    在参加技术革命的基础上，我院发动了教师和学生揭发教学中存在的问题。从已经暴露和揭发出的大量事实中，可以看出教学中少慢差费现象的严重性。
    在教学体系上，存在着许多重复、繁琐、孤立、割裂的现象，具体表现在课程门数过多。我院一般专业的教育计划都约有三十几门课。据初步调查和研究，有些课程是完全不必要或大部分不必要的，有些课程是可以合并的。例如，铸工专业的热工课要讲七十多个小时，但对铸工专业来说有用的只有其中的十多小时，为了需用其中一部，因而开出一整门课。课程门数太多造成的不良后果是：（一）不必要的重复，浪费时间；（二）把本来是互相联系的知识，割裂为孤立片面的东西，使学生不能全面地掌握和综合运用。如铸工专业的专业课竟达九门之多，其中铸造原理、铸铁学、铸钢学、有色金属铸造等四门课，本来作为一门课铸造合金及熔炼学，只须一百零四学时，但为了照顾教师特点与分工，分为上述四门课，就得各建系统，每门课没有几十小时是讲不下来的，因而学时总共就增加到一百九十九学时，其中内容不必要的重复很多。又如，机械制造专业，同一齿轮原理竟在五门课程中重复叙述，不仅浪费了时间，而且还讲得不透。
    在教学内容上，陈腐落后、脱离实际的现象也是严重的。在技术革命的高潮中，出现了大量的发明创造；原来被认为是高不可攀的某些科学知识，很快就在工人中普及了，并且在生产中广泛地运用了，而教学内容却没有或很少反映，仍然讲述那些古老的、甚至在生产上已经不用或少用的东西。例如，热机中仍然花费大量时间大讲十八世纪的往复式蒸汽机，还当作考试重点。分析化学中的硫化氢系统，也是十分古老陈旧，现代实验中基本不用，而教员仍然用许多时间把这些东西教给学生。化工方面的课程的情况尤为突出，在技术革命运动中，出现了许多化工方面的新技术，不少工厂的工艺设备都改变了，以至化工的许多专业课程，有如1958年农科学校面临当时农业技术大跃进形势，无法再在课堂上课的情况一样，现在也非抛开原来的课本，走到生产中去学习，并重建新的教学内容不可了。根据初步改革的结果，化工原理课程原来一百五十四小时的内容，技术革命后，有用的只剩五十小时了。其余大部分必须增加技术革命的新内容。某些实验课程的陈腐落后与脱离实际更加严重，例如物理实验课，许多实验是从古典物理中因袭下来的，内容十分贫乏、十分简单、十分枯燥，有的由于仪器设备古老，实验不准确，效率很低，不仅浪费时间，而且妨碍学生创造性的发挥，使学生对实验课不感兴趣。
    在教学方法上，也存在着严重的问题。许多课程是现象罗列、材料堆积，教员不善于通过对典型问题的深入讲述，帮助学生掌握科学的规律，而是平铺直叙地孤立地给学生介绍一大堆材料。如有机化学课向来是把各类有机物从名称到性质一一给学生罗列出来，使学生感到枯燥难记，称之为“有机大辞典”；机床课也是把各种机床平铺直叙地介绍给学生，学生称之为“产品介绍”。教学方法上还存在着脱离实际、墨守成规的现象，教员总是限制在教室内，用一块黑板及几张挂图进行教学，实际上许多问题到现场一看，学生就能很快地接受和掌握的，在教室内单凭黑板和挂图，花费大量时间还讲不清楚。
    更严重的是在少数教师中存在着安于少慢差费，反对多快好省；“理论独尊，数学至上”；宣扬科学家个人作用，反对历史唯物主义；散布形而上学和不可知论等等一系列的资产阶级反动思想。例如有人说：饭只能一口一口吃，学习不能跃进。有的教师对学生说，只有数学能证明的才是可以相信的。甚至有的教师还企图用数学的极限原理来证明社会主义建设不一定要高速度也能建成。有的教师则把有机合成的发展归功于法西斯德国发动的侵略战争。以上这些，都只是我院教学改革中初步揭发出来的问题。在参加了技术革命以后，极大多数师生们都感到再按原有的课程体系、教学内容和教学方法进行教学，是教不下去了，学不下去了，他们由于受到了颠扑不破的大量事实的教育，认识到教学改革的必要性和迫切性，因而为教学改革准备了较好的思想条件。
    其次，参加技术革命，还提供了教学改革的方向和具体途径。我们的教学改革，必须以毛泽东思想为指导，贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线和党的教育方针，反掉少慢差费的现象，贯彻多快好省的原则，这是很明确的。但是，对于理工农医的高等学校，在教学体系、教学内容和教学方法上，究竟应当改革些什么，怎样进行改革，这就需要从技术革新和技术革命中求得解答。自然科学是生产斗争经验的概括和总结，离开了生产斗争的实践，自然科学就不能发展。同样的道理，离开了技术革新与技术革命运动，自然科学的教学也不能得到真正的改革。经过几个月来参加技术革命的实践，我们对高等工业学校的教学改革，已经初步摸索到了一条门径。我们认为，在进行教学改革的时候，应当把教学内容的革新与教学体系的改革结合起来。在教学体系没有改革以前，应当积极地革新教学内容。但是，要使教学达到又多又快又好又省，单是一门一门课程内容的革新还是不够的，还必须解决教学体系的根本改革的问题。要解决这个问题，就必须参加到技术革新和技术革命运动中去，改革课程内容的目标是“去旧、增新、提高、致用”。例如，物理实验课的师生们已经编出了一套新的教材，改变了过去陈旧落后、脱离实际的状况，它的特点是紧密结合生产和科学研究，充分反映尖端科学技术，并且能培养学生的创造性和独立工作能力。革新后的物理实验课，包括基本量测、电磁测定、光学测定、真空技术、无线电技术、伦琴射线技术、超声波技术、光谱分析技术、半导体应用、放射性测量等十大最新技术，这就大大地提高了物理实验课的水平和质量。教学体系改革的目标是适当提高程度、适当控制学时、适当增加劳动。机械制造专业教师和四年级学生，在参加技术革命后，提出了一个新的专业课教学计划。按照这个计划，可以在三个月时间内学完原订要一年多才能学完的八门专业课，而且能够提高质量，把五年级的一整年时间腾出来进行科学研究。这个计划的特点是把现场教学作为专业课教学的主要形式，充分贯彻“实践——理论——实践”的原则，并且采用解剖麻雀，以典型带动一般的方法。经过前一阶段的试验，证明效果是良好的。
    参加技术革命，还可以高速度地提高教师和学生的水平，为教学改革准备必要的物质条件。我们进行教学改革的目的，是为了提高教学水平和教学质量。教学改革的过程，应该是教学水平和教学质量不断提高的过程。因此师生水平的提高，是胜利地进行教学改革的必要的物质条件。而参加技术革命，是提高教师和学生水平的重要途径。这次全民的技术革新和技术革命运动的重要特点之一，是高度的科学性。运动中出现的许多发明创造，都是运用了最新科学技术，有的已经远远超出了现有书本知识的范围，有的同尖端科学技术的研究紧密结合在一起。我院教师和学生在参加技术革命的过程中，在业务上得到了很大的提高。如我院机械系机械制造专业的部分教师和学生，帮助工厂设计出了许多种程序控制机床，自动控制系工业企业电气化与自动化专业的部分教师和学生，帮助工厂设计成了球磨机喂料自动控制装置和锅炉燃烧自动控制装置等，都是最新科学技术的运用，有些是书本上没有的，教师原来也不会的。在党的领导下，他们通过边干边学，和工人结合以及集体讨论与研究，就掌握并学会运用这些最新科学知识，这是闭门教学所不能达到的。由于教师的水平有了提高，就为教学改革创造了有利条件。
    参加技术革命，还帮助了教师和学生破除迷信、解放思想，在教学中大胆革新、勇于创造。他们在工厂看到工人阶级的冲天干劲和敢想敢干的共产主义风格，受到很大的鼓舞，回到学校参加教学改革的时候，就比较容易突破陈规旧律，大胆建立新的教学体系、教学内容和教学方式。
    根据几个月来参加技术革命和进行教学改革的经验，我们体会到高等学校参加全民的技术革新与技术革命运动，必须校外与校内同时并举，一方面加强学校与工厂与人民公社之间的协作，积极支援工农业生产的继续跃进，一方面要在校内大搞技术革新与技术革命，把学校用新的科学技术装备起来。只有这样，才能称得起“技术革命的学校”。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，应当坚持师生参加劳动，紧密与工人结合。在教学改革运动中，应当把思想革命与教学改革紧密的结合起来，批判资产阶级教育思想，树立无产阶级教育思想；把教学内容的革新与教学体系的改革结合起来；把破和立结合起来，边破边立。在教学改革的过程中，一定要加强基础课，提高教学质量，而不能削弱基础课，降低教学质量。要搞好技术革命和教学改革，都必须加强党的领导，认真学习毛泽东思想，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。
    我们大连工学院一定要成为技术革命的学校，在今后不断地参加技术革命，不断地改革教学，不断地提高教学质量，更好地为国家培养又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
