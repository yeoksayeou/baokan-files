Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Léopoldville Dispatch: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba said on the evening of the 19th, "No one can blame us for seeking help from the Soviet Union, because all Western countries are standing on the side of the Belgians."

Lumumba made this statement to reporters at the airport upon returning to the Congolese capital, Léopoldville, with President Kasavubu from Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province. He condemned the Belgian aggressor troops for not only failing to withdraw after the Congolese government issued several ultimatums but also for continuing to invade the Congolese interior.

He said, "We were promised that as soon as the United Nations troops arrived, the Belgian troops would leave." But, "The United Nations (troops) are here..., and the Belgians are still here."

Lumumba revealed that on the 18th, Belgian aggressor troops parachuted into Bunia near Stanleyville, arbitrarily disarmed the local Congolese troops, killed two Congolese soldiers, and confiscated all weapons and ammunition from the Congolese.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Léopoldville Dispatch: The struggle of the Congolese military and civilians against imperialist interference and to defend the independence of their motherland is developing in depth.

In Lower Congo, Congolese troops continued to control an area of approximately two hundred miles long and one hundred miles wide between Thysville and the coast on the 19th. However, approximately one thousand United Nations troops arrived in the city from Léopoldville on the 19th.

Approximately one thousand five hundred Congolese soldiers, equipped with heavy weapons, continued to strictly guard the strategically important port of Matadi after repelling invading Belgian paratroopers. However, according to an Associated Press report from Thysville on the 19th, a United Nations force would be sent to break through and seize this port, which is already controlled by Congolese troops.

In Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, Congolese military and civilians remained vigilant, preparing to resist Belgian aggression. According to reports, on the 18th, when a United Nations force landed at the local airport, people thought Belgian paratroopers had arrived. All armed Congolese military and civilians rushed out of their barracks, quickly surrounded the airport, and prepared for battle. According to an Associated Press report from Stanleyville on the 19th, "It appears unlikely that United Nations troops can disarm Congolese soldiers without difficulty."

In Watsa, in northeastern Congo, local people also launched an anti-colonialist struggle and surrounded some colonists who provoked them. However, according to reports, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld considers the situation there to be "serious" and intends to send a United Nations force there under the pretext of "saving European residents."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: TASS reported on the 19th on the Soviet Union's aid to the Congolese Republic. The communiqué stated that the Soviet government, based on the friendly and fraternal feelings of the Soviet people towards the Congolese people, decided to provide the Congolese Republic with food aid. On the morning of July 19th, three "Ilyushin-18" aircraft took off from Moscow bound for Léopoldville. These three aircraft carried the first batch of food from the Soviet government to the Congolese Republic. In the near future, the ship "Leninogorsk" will also carry wheat, sugar, and condensed milk from Odessa to the Congo.

The communiqué also stated that the Soviet government also decided to satisfy the wishes of the Ghanaian government, which had requested assistance from the Soviet government through the Soviet Embassy in Accra to transport Ghanaian troops, sent to the Congolese Republic according to the United Nations Security Council resolution, from Ghana to the Congolese Republic. To this end, the aforementioned three Soviet "Ilyushin-18" aircraft, after transporting the aid food from Moscow to Léopoldville, will proceed to Accra in order to transport the Ghanaian troops from Accra to Léopoldville.

The communiqué stated that the Soviet government, in accordance with the aforementioned request of the Ghanaian government, has also dispatched two additional "Ilyushin-18" aircraft, which, upon arrival in Accra, will immediately begin transporting the Ghanaian troops to the Congolese Republic.

    卢蒙巴谴责西方各国支持比利时侵略
    马塔迪港和斯坦利维尔刚果守军准备抗击侵略者
    新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴19日晚上说，“任何人都不能责怪我们求助于苏联，因为一切西方国家都站在比利时人一边。”
    卢蒙巴这番话是在他同总统卡萨武布从东方省首府斯坦利维尔回到刚果首都利奥波德维尔时，在机场上向记者们说的。他谴责比利时侵略军在刚果政府发出好几次最后通牒后不仅没有撤走，而且还在不断向刚果内地侵入。
    他说，“我们被许诺，只要联合国军队到来，比利时军队就会离开”。但是，“联合国（军队）在这里……，比利时人仍在这里”。
    卢蒙巴揭露，比利时侵略军18
  日在斯坦利维尔附近的布尼亚空降，蛮横地解除了当地刚果军队的武装，杀死两名刚果士兵，还没收了刚果人的一切武器和弹药。
    新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民掀起的反对帝国主义干涉、保卫祖国独立的斗争，正在深入地发展。
    在下刚果地区，刚果军队在19日仍然控制着太斯维尔城到海岸之间的大约二百英里长、一百英里宽的地区。但是，大约有一千人的联合国军队已在19日从利奥波德维尔到达这个城市。
    装备有重型武器的大约一千五百名刚果士兵在击退入侵的比利时伞兵后，仍然严守着在战略上具有重要价值的马塔迪港。但是，据美联社19日从太斯维尔报道，一支联合国军部队将被派去突破并夺下这个已由刚果军队控制的港口。
    在东方省首府斯坦利维尔，刚果军民时刻保持着警惕，准备抗击比利时军队的侵略。有消息说，18日，当一支联合国部队在当地机场降落时，人们以为比利时伞兵已到，所有武装的刚果军民都冲出兵营，很快地包围了机场，并作好了战斗准备。据美联社19日从斯坦利维尔报道说，“看来联合国军队不可能没有困难地解除刚果士兵的武装”。
    在刚果东北部的瓦查，当地人民也展开了反殖民主义斗争，并包围了一些向他们挑衅的殖民者。但是，有消息说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德竟认为那里“局势严重”，借口“拯救欧洲居民”打算派一支联合国部队到那里去。
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社19日发表了关于苏联援助刚果共和国的公报。公报中说，苏联政府基于苏联人民对刚果人民所怀的友好的兄弟般的感情，决定给刚果共和国以食品援助。7月19日早晨，三架“伊尔—18式”飞机从莫斯科起飞前往利奥波德维尔。这三架飞机上装载着苏联政府运往刚果共和国的第一批食品。最近，“列宁诺戈尔斯克号”轮船还将载着小麦、糖和炼乳从敖德萨开往刚果。
    公报还说，苏联政府还决定满足加纳政府的愿望，加纳政府曾通过苏联驻阿克拉大使馆请求苏联政府协助把根据联合国安全理事会的决议派往刚果共和国去的加纳军队从加纳运送到刚果共和国。为此，上述三架苏联“伊尔—18式”飞机在把援助的食品从莫斯科运送到利奥波德维尔以后，将前往阿克拉，以便把加纳军队从阿克拉运送到利奥波德维尔。
    公报说苏联政府还根据加纳政府的上述请求，增派了两架“伊尔—18式”飞机，这两架飞机在抵达阿克拉后将立即着手把加纳军队运送到刚果共和国。
