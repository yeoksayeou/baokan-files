　　How We Won a Bumper Wheat Harvest
　　First Secretary of the CPC Shucheng County Committee Shi Yuansheng
    Under the glorious illumination of the three magic weapons – the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune – the people of Shucheng, with their diligent hands, have achieved a summer harvest. This year, the number of high-yield wheat fields, the uniformity of growth, and the high yields are unprecedented.
    How did we achieve a comprehensive bumper wheat harvest?
      Plant More Early-Maturing Crops
    Shucheng County, Anhui, has a large population and limited land, with less than one mu of cultivated land per capita. Over the past few years, in our efforts to increase grain production, we have continuously expanded the planting area and practiced intensive cultivation to increase yield per unit area, implementing the "two-legged" approach of planting more for more yield and high yield for more yield. Based on years of experience, drought and flood disasters often occur here after July each year. Therefore, in expanding the planting area, we followed the "three reforms" spirit proposed by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee. We especially emphasized expanding the planting area of summer-ripening and early-maturing crops to increase the proportion of summer harvests, achieving disaster avoidance and yield protection, and planting more for early harvest. Last autumn, we proposed continuing to expand the planting area of summer-ripening crops by 20%, and adding the planting area of early-maturing crops, accounting for 42% of the total annual planting area, with a harvest volume accounting for more than 60% of the total annual output. That is, to obtain more than half of the annual grain output before the autumn harvest, laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest throughout the year. This is an extremely important strategic measure in Shucheng County's agricultural production. According to this strategic policy, a high tide of extensive planting was launched throughout the county. Not only was wheat extensively planted on cultivated land, but also on reclaimed land, in front of houses and behind houses, on pond embankments, and on roadside vacant land. As a result, the planting area was expanded by 20% compared to the previous year, realizing the great leap forward plan of planting more. At the time of sowing, a mass tool reform movement was launched throughout the county. In just ten days, more than 36,000 furrow openers and seeders were created and imitated, greatly improving work efficiency, completing wheat sowing one agricultural season earlier than in previous years, and ensuring quality, achieving three-fertilizer sowing, row planting with close spacing, and meticulous land preparation, realizing garden-style cultivation.
    Seize Three Key Stages, Attack Vigorously
    In our efforts to achieve a bumper wheat harvest, we summarized years of experience, seized the three key stages of autumn sowing, root consolidation, and green-up, attacking vigorously to promote comprehensive progress. We focused on these three key stages because (1) these three stages play a decisive role in whether wheat can achieve a bumper harvest. The amount of autumn sowing area, the quality of sowing, and the earliness of sowing determine the foundation for a bumper wheat harvest; the strength of root consolidation and the amount of tillering play a decisive role in the total number of ears per unit area; the speed of green-up and the thickness of jointing determine the length of the ear and the size of the grain. (2) The seasonality of these three stages is very strong. If autumn sowing is missed, the quantity and quality are not guaranteed; if root consolidation fertilizer is applied late, it is prone to frost damage and fewer effective tillers; if green-up management violates the farming season, it will either result in yellowing and thinning, reducing yield, or excessive vegetative growth, making it prone to lodging. (3) The workload of these three stages is also very large. Taking fertilizer as an example, the amount of fertilizer applied in these three stages accounts for 80% of the total fertilizer applied. Therefore, we seized the three key stages of autumn sowing, root consolidation, and green-up, launching three major inspections and organizing three major assaults to work vigorously. During autumn sowing, we organized a major inspection focusing on quantity and quality, and during root consolidation and green-up, we organized two major inspections focusing on topdressing. These three major inspections were carried out from bottom to top. Before each inspection, the county party committee set inspection standards and notified the inspection date in advance, conducting publicity among cadres and commune members so that everyone knew. While launching a major ideological mobilization, we organized a major assault to welcome the major inspection. The inspection method was first a self-inspection by the production team to welcome the inspection by the brigade; a self-inspection by the brigade to welcome the inspection by the commune; a self-inspection by the commune to welcome the major inspection by the county party committee. On the basis of the three inspections, the county party committee organized the commune party committee secretaries to go to every commune for a comprehensive inspection, after which they were evaluated and model units were established. Each major inspection launched a competition movement of catching up with each other. In short, the three major inspections formed three major assaults. The county's 120,000 mu of wheat completed the sowing task in just ten days. In the second battle for root consolidation, it took only half a month to universally water and apply manure to the wheat, covering it with soil and fertilizer to promote good root consolidation, more tillering, and safe overwintering. In the third assault on the green-up stage, it also took only ten days to hoe weeds and topdress fertilizer in every field, promoting early green-up of the wheat seedlings and consolidating effective tillering. These three major inspections and major assaults played a decisive role in achieving this year's bumper wheat harvest.
    Go Deep into the Front Line of Production
    Cadres at all levels going deep into the front line of production, providing more in-depth, specific, detailed, and comprehensive leadership for production, is an important factor in Shucheng County's achievement of a bumper wheat harvest. Under the new situation of this year's large wheat planting area, high requirements for cultivation technology, and large increase in production, we are required to further improve our work methods, go deep into the fields and work alongside the masses to participate in and lead production, so as to discover problems in production in a timely manner and solve them in a timely manner.
    We adopted the method of extensively developing high-yield demonstration plots at all levels, extensively developing model fields, and focusing on weak links, using model fields as the standard. The county established 146 large and small high-yield demonstration plots, covering an area of more than 73,000 mu, accounting for more than 60% of the total wheat area. Each high-yield demonstration plot was personally led by leaders at all levels to establish model fields. Model fields were made in advance at the main stages of autumn sowing, root consolidation, and green-up. Each time a model was made, it was a combination of cadres, masses, and technicians, jointly studying standards, quality, and operating techniques, doing, watching, discussing, and ordering. Seeing is more profound than listening, and doing is more practical than seeing. If you do well, you also learn. This combines the "four movements" of cadres and masses – moving their brains, moving their hands, moving their mouths, and moving their eyes. Cadres go deep into reality, learn technology, the masses broaden their horizons, liberate their minds, and clarify their practices. After returning, they become promoters of model fields. Therefore, commune members say: "Model fields are schools, doing, watching, and discussing together, learning new methods, and opening our minds."
    In going deep into the front line of production, we also adopted the "release, contract, and support" three-character measures to strengthen the leadership of weak areas. "Release" is to send cadres down. Since autumn sowing, the county party committee has successively sent down a large number of cadres at all levels, including five county party committee members sent down to serve as commune secretaries, 46 commune secretaries and deputy secretaries serving as brigade general branch secretaries, and 208 brigade cadres serving as production team branch secretaries, further strengthening the leadership of backward areas organizationally. The cadres sent down carried forward the working style of being down-to-earth and going deep among the masses, bravely shouldering the responsibility of changing backward areas. Wu Baoping, deputy secretary of the Ganzheng Commune Party Committee, was sent down to the Xitang Brigade to serve as the general branch secretary of the brigade. During autumn sowing, there was a shortage of fuel for burning soil fertilizer. He led the masses on an expedition to the mountains, cutting mountain grass and burning soil fertilizer in large quantities, ensuring fertilizer for autumn sowing. "Contract" means that county party committee members and secretaries at all levels of the commune go deep into backward areas to contract and take responsibility. Seven county party committee members and 75 commune secretaries, deputy secretaries, and brigade general branch secretaries contracted backward areas, sat down, and grasped to the end, helping them study methods and solve specific problems. "Support" means organizing areas with good conditions to support backward areas with manpower and materials in accordance with the principle of equal exchange.
    Because cadres go deep into providing specific, detailed, and comprehensive leadership for production, grasping points and surfaces, grasping advanced and backward areas, strengthening leadership at all levels, inspiring the masses, and promoting production, a comprehensive leap forward in wheat production has been formed.

　　我们是怎样夺取小麦大丰收的
　　中共舒城县委第一书记　史元生
    舒城人民，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下，以自己勤劳的双手，获得了夏季丰收。今年小麦丰产片之多，生长之匀，产量之高，为以往任何一年所不及。
    我们是怎样夺取小麦全面大丰收的呢？
      多种早熟作物
    安徽舒城县人多地少，按人口平均每人不到一亩耕地。几年来，我们在争取粮食增产中，一方面不断扩大播种面积，一方面进行精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，贯彻多种多收和高产多收“两条腿走路”的方针。根据历年经验，这里每年在7月以后，往往发生水旱灾害，因此在扩大播种面积中，按照安徽省委提出的“三改”精神。我们特别注重扩大夏熟作物和早熟作物的播种面积，增加夏季收成比重，达到避灾保收，多种早收。去年秋种时，我们提出继续扩大夏熟作物播种面积20％，加上早熟作物的播种面积，共占全年总播种面积的42％，收获量占全年总产量60％以上。也就是要在大秋收获前，就拿到全年粮食产量的一半以上，为全年大丰收打下巩固基础。这在舒城县农业生产上是具有极其重要的战略意义的措施。根据这样一个战略方针，在全县掀起了大种特种的高潮。不仅在耕地上大种麦子，而且开荒、利用庄前宅后、塘埂、路边空隙地种麦，结果比前年扩大播种面积20％，实现了多种的跃进计划。在下种的时候，全县掀起了一个群众性的工具改革运动，在短短十天当中，创制和仿制了开沟器和条播器三万六千多件，大大提高了工效，使小麦比往年提早一个节令播完，又保证了质量，达到了三肥下种，条播密植，精细整地，实现了园田化。
    抓住三关　猛攻大干
    我们在夺取小麦大丰收中，总结了多年的经验，抓住了秋种、盘根、返青三大关口，猛攻大干，推动全面。我们所以狠抓这三关，因为（一）这三关对小麦能否取得大丰收，都起着决定性的作用。秋种面积多少，质量好坏，种的早迟，是决定小麦能否大丰收的基础；盘根强弱，分蘖多少，对单位面积内的总穗数起着决定作用；返青快慢，拔节粗细，决定着穗子长短与籽粒大小。（二）这三关的季节性十分强烈，秋种一失时，数量与质量就失去了保证；盘根肥追迟了，容易遭受冻害，有效分蘖少；返青管理违背农时，不是黄瘦减产，就是恋青易倒。（三）这三关工作量又很大，以肥料为例，这三关的施肥量要占总施肥量的80％。为此，我们抓住秋种、盘根、返青三大关口，开展三次大检查、组织三次大突击，猛攻特干。秋种时，以数量质量并举为重点，组织大检查，在盘根和返青时，以追肥为重点分别组织两次大检查，这三次大检查，都是自下而上的层层检查。每次检查前，县委订出检查标准，预先通知检查日期，在干部和社员中进行宣传，使得家喻户晓，人人皆知。在思想大发动的同时，组织大突击，迎接大检查。检查方法，首先是生产队自查，迎接大队检查；大队自查，迎接公社检查；公社自查，迎接县委大检查。在三次检查的基础上，县委组织公社党委书记，社社到、全面查，查后评比，树立标兵。每次大检查，都掀起了你追我赶的竞赛运动。总之，三次大检查，形成了三次大突击。全县十二万亩小麦，仅用十天时间，就全部完成了播种任务。二战盘根关，只有半个月，就把麦子普遍浇上了水粪，盖上了土肥，促使麦苗盘根好，分蘖多，安全越冬。三攻返青关，也只有十天时间，就块块锄了草，墒墒追了肥，促进麦苗提早返青巩固了有效分蘖。这三次大检查，大突击，对实现今年小麦大丰收起了决定性的作用。
    深入生产第一线
    各级干部深入生产第一线，更深入具体更细致全面地领导生产，是舒城县获得小麦大丰收的重要因素。在今年小麦播种面积多，耕作技术要求高，增产幅度大的新形势下，要求我们进一步改进工作方法，深入到田头现场和广大群众一道参加生产领导生产，以便及时发现生产中的问题，及时解决。
    我们采取了层层大搞丰产片，大搞样子田，大抓薄弱环节，以样子田为标准。全县建立了大小丰产片一百四十六个，面积达七万三千多亩，占小麦总面积60％以上。每个丰产片都有各级领导干部亲自挂帅，建立样子田。样子田在秋种、盘根、返青等主要关口，事先作出样子。每次作样子都是干部、群众、技术员三者结合，共同研究标准质量和操作技术，边做、边看、边议、边订。看比听深刻，做比看实际，做好了，也学会了。这样就把干部和群众动脑、动手、动嘴、动眼“四动”结合起来了。干部深入实际，学会了技术，群众扩大了眼界，解放了思想，明确了作法。回去以后，就成为样子田的推广者，因而社员说：“样子田是学校，边做边看边商讨，学会了新办法，心里开了窍。”
    在深入生产第一线中，我们又采取了“放、包、援”三字措施，加强薄弱地区领导。“放”是下放干部。秋种以来，县委先后两次，层层下放了大批干部，其中有五个县委委员下放担任公社书记，四十六个公社书记、副书记担任大队总支书记，二百零八名大队干部，担任生产队支部书记，从组织上进一步加强了后进地区的领导。下放干部发扬了踏踏实实，深入群众的工作作风，把改变后进地区的责任勇敢地担负起来。干钲公社党委副书记吴宝平下放到西塘大队担任大队总支书记，秋种中烧土肥缺燃料，他带领群众远征山区，大砍山草，大烧土肥，保证了秋种肥料。“包”就是县委委员与公社各级书记分别深入后进地区包干负责。有七个县委委员，七十五个公社书记、副书记、大队总支书记，包干了后进地区，坐下来，抓到底。帮助他们研究办法，解决具体问题。“援”就是按照等价交换的原则，组织条件好的地区，以人力、物力支援后进地区。
    由于干部深入具体、细致全面地领导生产，抓点抓面，抓先进抓后进，层层加强领导，鼓舞了群众，推动了生产，形成了小麦生产的全面跃进。
