From our Hefei dispatch on July 17th: After the summer planting work was basically completed, people's communes in various parts of Anhui Province, based on the spirit of "three kinds of crops, seven-part management, ten-part harvest; plant it and manage it, manage it to the end," quickly mobilized forces to focus on farmland management. Currently, the province has invested more than two million laborers in field management. Commune members not only manage newly planted crops, but also step up the management of spring-sown crops that are about to be harvested; they manage not only food crops, but also cash crops; they manage not only the large fields, but also the crops planted in the "ten edges" of vacant land. The slogan put forward by the commune members is: manage everything, manage early, manage carefully, and manage well.

This year's summer-sown crops in Anhui Province are generally growing well due to timely planting and high sowing quality. However, due to continuous rain some time ago, weeds grew very quickly in the fields, and in some places the emergence of seedlings was uneven due to rain, and there were still missing seedlings. Early-sown crops urgently need topdressing, and spring-sown crops that are about to be harvested must also be treated for pests to prevent lodging. For this reason, Party committees at all levels are seizing the current favorable opportunity when the summer planting is basically completed and the "double抢" (double rush harvest and planting) work has not yet begun, deploying labor, and focusing on field management. Counties in the Bengbu area are carrying out seedling inspection and replanting and weeding of newly planted crops. After the rain, Xiao County and Su County mobilized more than 110,000 people to take advantage of the moisture to carry out a blitz of seedling inspection and replanting, adopting methods such as transplanting seedlings and replanting and germinating seeds to quickly make up for the missing seedlings of more than 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains. Dangshan, a major cotton producing area, has launched a field management upsurge of "not letting go of a boll or bud" of cotton during the current season of large boll formation. At present, 250,000 mu of ridge fields in the county have been renovated, 240,000 mu have been deeply cultivated, and pest control has been basically completed.

Huainan and the areas along the Yangtze River, which are rich in rice production, are currently focusing on rice management. Counties in the Wuhu area broke the theory of early rice determinism and, under the slogan of "never give up until the grain is in the barn," while managing mid-season rice and single-season late rice, mobilized 300,000 people to continue to strengthen the late-stage management of early rice. They focused on skillful topdressing of panicle fertilizer, disease and insect control, and prevention of lodging, and adopted the method of leading cadres, technicians, and commune members meeting in the fields to observe seedlings, fields, weather, varieties, and soil, prescribe the right medicine, and reasonably apply fertilizer. More than 1.8 million mu of pregnancy ear fertilizer has now been applied in the area. In order to prevent rice stem borer damage, the area mobilized 400,000 people to light 510,000 lamps at night to trap and kill rice moths.

In the current field management, Party committee secretaries and leading cadres at all levels have generally gone deep into the front line of production and joined the commune members in the battle, promoting the quantitative and qualitative field management work. Zuo Jingtang, Secretary of the Tianchang County Party Committee, weeded with the commune members in Yangcun Commune. He found that a few fields were weeded shallowly and not to the edges. He worked with the commune members to study and formulate the "five cleanliness" standards of "clean soil surface, clean drainage ditches, clean field ridges, clean field corners, and clean between plants," which greatly improved the quality of management.

    三种七管十成收　种下就要管到底
　　安徽加紧管理各种农作物
　　全省投入田间管理的劳动力达二百万人
    本报合肥17日电　安徽省各地人民公社在夏种工作基本结束之后，根据三种七管十成收，种下就管，一管到底的精神，迅速调集兵力，狠抓农田管理。目前，全省投入田间管理的劳动力已达二百万人以上。社员们不仅管理刚播栽的作物，同时加紧管即将收割的春播作物；不仅管粮食作物，也管经济作物；不仅管大田，也管“十边”空隙地种植的作物。社员们提出的口号是：样样都管，管早、管细、管好。
    今年安徽省夏播作物，由于种得适时，播种质量较高，一般都生长得良好。但由于前些时候，连续阴雨，地里杂草长得很快，特别是有些地方因阴雨关系出苗不齐，还存在缺苗断垅现象；早播作物极需追肥，同时即将收割的春播作物也要治虫，防止倒伏。为此各级党委都抓紧当前夏种基本结束，“双抢”工作还未开始的有利时机，部署了劳力，大抓田间管理。蚌埠地区各县，对新栽作物正进行查苗补苗和锄草工作。萧县、宿县在雨后动员十一万多人，趁墒突击查苗补苗，采取移苗补栽、催芽补种等办法，很快补齐了缺苗断垅的山芋、杂粮作物五十多万亩。主要产棉区的砀山，在当前大结伏桃的季节，掀起了棉花一铃一蕾不脱落的田间管理高潮。目前，全县已有二十五万亩畦田得到整修，二十四万亩深锄，防虫基本结束。
    盛产水稻的淮南及沿江地区，当前正大抓水稻管理工作。芜湖专区各县打破早稻定局论，在“谷不进仓，绝不罢休”口号下，在管理中稻和单季晚稻同时，调集三十万人继续加强早稻的后期管理。他们以巧追穗肥、防治病虫、防止倒伏为中心，采取领导干部、技术员和社员会师田头的办法，看苗、看田、看天、看品种、看土壤，对症下药，合理追肥。全区现已施孕穗肥一百八十多万亩。为了防止螟虫为害，全区发动四十万人次，在晚上点灯五十一万盏诱杀螟蛾。
    在当前田间管理中，各级党委书记和领导干部，普遍深入生产第一线，和社员一起投入战斗，推动田间管理工作有量有质。中共天长县委书记左敬塘，在杨村公社和社员一起锄草，发现少数田锄得浅，没有锄到边，就和社员一起研究订出“墒上净、墒沟净、田埂净、田拐净、棵间净”的五净标准，大大提高了管理质量。（附图片）
