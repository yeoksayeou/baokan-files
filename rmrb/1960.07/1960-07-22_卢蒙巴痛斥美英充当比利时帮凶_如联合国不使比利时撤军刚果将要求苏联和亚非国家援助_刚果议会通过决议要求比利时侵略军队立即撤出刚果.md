Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba announced at a press conference on the 20th that if the United Nations does not make Belgian troops withdraw from the Congo immediately, the Congolese government will immediately request the Soviet Union or any other Asian-African country to send troops to the Congo. He condemned the imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain for supporting Belgium's aggression against the Congo.

Lumumba pointed out that the United Nations does not treat the Congo as a sovereign country. He said, "It seems that all our decisions should be subject to Belgium's opinions, but Belgium has invaded us, and we are a sovereign country. We are occupied by foreign countries, and all our decisions are submitted to the Belgian government for approval by the United Nations." He emphasized, "This is not acceptable."

Lumumba said that the Congolese government has noted that no Western country, whether it is the United States or Britain, has raised even the slightest objection to Belgium's criminal aggression, "they have consistently supported the Belgians."

He said that Western countries support "Belgium's aggression against the Congo, and they are doing so, even though Belgium's aggression threatens world peace."

Lumumba also said that the only support the Congo has received comes from the East. He said that any assistance from Eastern countries will not be attached with political conditions.

Lumumba read to reporters a letter he wrote to the United Nations Security Council and said that he was awaiting the results of the Security Council meeting "and then take action." He said, "We know that the Soviet Union is willing to help us." A reporter asked him, "If the Security Council decides to oppose Soviet intervention outside the scope of the United Nations, what attitude will he take?" He replied, "This will prove the existence of a capitalist conspiracy against the Congo."

At the press conference, Lumumba once again severely condemned the Belgian government for sending troops to invade the Congo. He accused Belgium of carrying out a reign of terror in many areas of the Congo, massacring the Congolese people, and engaging in illegal activities to split Congolese territory in the Katanga Province of the Congo. He pointed out, "According to the actions of the Belgian government, it is insulting the Congolese government, the Congolese parliament, the Congolese president, and myself." Lumumba also emphasized that the Congolese government will not be satisfied with the Belgian troops merely withdrawing to their bases in Gamina and Kitona in the Congo.

It is reported that the United Nations Under-Secretary-General, American national Bunch, also attended the press conference held at Lumumba's private residence and spoke before Lumumba. He announced that as of the 20th, more than 3,000 UN troops were in the Congo, and by the end of this week, the number will exceed 10,000. Bunch dared not directly answer the Congolese government's repeated demands to order the Belgian aggressor troops to withdraw from the Congo immediately. He only evasively said that he fully believed that the United Nations could implement the Security Council's resolution requiring the withdrawal of Belgian troops, but "perhaps not as quickly as the Prime Minister here or we would like."

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch from Leopoldville: The Congolese Parliament passed a resolution on the evening of the 19th, demanding that Belgian troops immediately withdraw from the Congo. The resolution also called for the recall of the Belgian ambassador to the Congo and demanded that the Belgian government immediately and unconditionally return the funds that the Congo had given to Belgium. It has been previously reported that the Congolese government has informed the Belgian government that the Congo formally severed diplomatic relations with Belgium on July 14.

    卢蒙巴痛斥美英充当比利时帮凶
    如联合国不使比利时撤军刚果将要求苏联和亚非国家援助
    刚果议会通过决议要求比利时侵略军队立即撤出刚果
    新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴20日在记者招待会上宣布，如果联合国不使比利时军队立即撤出刚果，刚果政府将立即要求苏联或任何其他亚非国家出兵刚果。他谴责了美、英等帝国主义国家支持比利时对刚果的侵略。
    卢蒙巴指出，联合国不把刚果当作一个有主权的国家。他说，“看来我们的一切决定都应该服从比利时的意见，可是比利时侵略了我们，而我们是一个主权国家。我们被外国占领，我们的一切决定都被联合国提交比利时政府批准”。他强调说，“这是不行的。”
    卢蒙巴说，刚果政府注意到，西方国家，无论是美国还是英国，没有一个对比利时的罪恶侵略提出过那怕是最轻微的反对，“它们一直一致地支持比利时人”。
    他说，西方国家支持“比利时对刚果的侵略，它们正在这样做，尽管比利时的侵略威胁世界和平”。
    卢蒙巴还说，刚果得到的唯一支持来自东方。他说，来自东方国家的任何援助将不附带政治条件。
    卢蒙巴向记者们宣读了他写给联合国安全理事会的一封信，并且说，他在等待安全理事会会议的结果，“然后采取行动”。他说，“我们知道苏联是愿意帮助我们的”。一位记者向他提出，“如果安理会决定反对苏联在联合国范围以外进行干预，他将采取什么态度”，他回答说，“这将证明存在着反对刚果的资本主义阴谋”。
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上再次严厉谴责比利时政府派兵侵犯刚果。他指责比利时在刚果许多地区进行恐怖统治，屠杀刚果人民，并在刚果加丹加省从事分裂刚果领土的非法活动。他指出，“根据比利时政府的行动，它是在侮辱刚果政府、刚果议会、刚果总统和我自己”。卢蒙巴还强调指出，刚果政府将不会满足于比利时军队仅仅撤退到它在刚果的加米纳和基托纳基地。
    据报道，联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇也出席了这次在卢蒙巴私人住宅举行的记者招待会，并且在卢蒙巴发言以前讲了话。他宣布，到20日为止，已有三千多名联合国军在刚果，到本周末，这个数字将超过一万人。本奇不敢正面答复刚果政府屡次提出的限令比利时侵略军立即撤出刚果的要求。他只是躲躲闪闪地说，他完全相信联合国能够执行安理会要求比利时军队撤退的决议，但是，“也许没有像这里的总理或是我们喜欢的那样快”。
    新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果议会19日晚通过决议，要求比利时军队立即从刚果撤走。决议还要求召回比利时驻刚果大使，并且要求比利时政府立即无条件地归还刚果交给比利时的基金。前已报道，刚果政府已照会比利时政府，刚果于7月14日起正式与比利时断绝外交关系。
