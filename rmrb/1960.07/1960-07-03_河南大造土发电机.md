Zhengzhou Dispatch from our Newspaper, July 2nd. Factories in counties, cities, communes, and production teams in Henan Province are actively manufacturing indigenous generators. In the first quarter alone, they produced more than 1,700 various types of indigenous generators, with a total capacity of 25,000 kilowatts. Nineteen counties and cities, including Luyi, Anyang, and Xuchang, have also successfully manufactured indigenous generators ranging from 100 to 300 kilowatts.

Manufacturing indigenous generators is an important achievement in the mass electricity generation campaign in Henan Province. It aligns with the aspirations of the broad masses of peasants to quickly shed the "poor and blank" state, improve labor productivity, and develop agricultural and industrial production at high speed. Therefore, after the Hongqi Machinery Factory of Chengguan People's Commune in Changge County pioneered the 3.5-kilowatt induction indigenous generator, it quickly blossomed and bore fruit throughout the province in just a few months. Xinxiang County, Zhoukou Town, Luoyang City, and other places have successively created several types of indigenous generators, including ordinary excitation generators, mechanical rectifier generators, and cast iron mechanical rectifier generators. Xiaye Commune in Jiyuan County has also made a cow-drawn train generator. These indigenous generators, after being assessed by relevant scientific and technological departments, are considered to have the advantages of being easy to manufacture, saving labor and materials, and having good performance. These indigenous generators also have their own characteristics. Among them, the mechanical rectifier generator, compared with the ordinary excitation generator of the same capacity, shortens the total length by 12%, can save 22% of non-ferrous and ferrous metals, reduce manufacturing man-hours by 42%, and reduce costs by about 35%, making it a small motor suitable for rural manufacturing. The cast iron mechanical rectifier generator created by the Fugou County Machinery Factory is a new development of the mechanical rectifier generator and is also the easiest type of indigenous generator to promote at present. In addition to the advantages of being labor-saving, economical, and having good efficiency, the biggest advantage of the cast iron mechanical rectifier generator is that it has found a material to replace silicon steel sheets. At the rural mass electricity generation experience exchange meeting held in Henan not long ago, it was decided to universally promote this type of indigenous generator in small and medium-sized power stations across the country.

The emergence of these indigenous generators has opened up a path to accelerate rural electrification in a faster, better, and more economical way. With indigenous generators, the contradiction of the current supply of foreign generators falling short of demand can be resolved. By manufacturing indigenous generators, a technical team can also be cultivated for electrification. At present, Henan Province has already cultivated more than 16,000 technicians in motor manufacturing. Many rural artisans and ordinary peasants and workers who originally knew nothing about generators have become skilled motor manufacturers and local experts. Zhao Futang, a Communist Party member of Xindian Commune in Xinzheng County, worked as a hired hand and begged for food in the old society. In the mass electricity generation campaign, after hard work and study, he and seven workers in the factory's electrical engineering team made the first 3.5-kilowatt indigenous generator. He has manufactured a total of five types of indigenous generators, including a 75-kilowatt mechanical rectifier generator.

Now, the broad masses have installed self-made indigenous generators in 963 communes and more than 1,000 small and medium-sized power stations in urban and rural areas, driving machines to irrigate, grind flour, hull rice, gin cotton... during the day, and at night, electric lights shine brightly. The commune members all smile and sing the praises of a better life.

    河南大造土发电机
    本报郑州2日电　河南省广大县、市、社、队工厂积极制造土发电机。仅第一季度，就制造出各种土发电机一千七百多台，总容量二万五千瓩。鹿邑、安阳、许昌等十九个县、市还制造成功了一百至三百瓩的土发电机。
    制造土发电机，是河南省群众办电运动中的重要成就。它符合广大农民尽快摆脱“一穷二白”状况，提高劳动生产率，高速度发展农业、工业生产的愿望。因此，从长葛县城关人民公社红旗机械厂首创三点五瓩感应式土发电机以后，短短几个月时间，就在全省各地普遍开花结果。新郑县、周口镇、洛阳市等地，先后创制了普通励磁发电机、机械整流发电机、铸铁机械整流发电机等几种土发电机。济源县下冶公社还制成了牛拉列车发电机。这些土发电机，经过有关科学技术部门鉴定，认为具有便于制造、省工省料、性能良好等优点。这些土发电机又各具特点。其中机械整流发电机比同等容量的普通励磁发电机，缩短总长度12％，可以节约有色金属、黑色金属22％，减少制造工时42％，降低成本35％左右，是一种适合农村制造的小型电机。扶沟县机械厂创造的铸铁机械整流发电机，是机械整流发电机的新发展，也是目前最便于推广的一种土发电机。铸铁机械整流发电机，除具有省工、经济、效能良好等优点外，最大的好处是找到了代替矽钢片的材料。不久以前在河南召开的农村群众办电经验交流会议上，决定在全国中小型电站普遍推广这种土发电机。
    这些土发电机的出现，为加速农村电气化开辟了一条多快好省的道路。有了土发电机，可以解决当前洋电机供不应求的矛盾。通过制造土发电机，还可以为电气化培养一支技术队伍。现在，河南全省已经培养出制造电机的技术人员一万六千多人。许多原来对发电机一窍不通的农村工匠和普通农民、工人，变成了制造电机的能手和土专家。新郑县辛店公社共产党员赵福堂，在旧社会当过长工、要过饭。在群众性办电运动中他经过苦钻苦学，和本厂电工组七个工人一道，制成了第一台三点五瓩的土发电机。他一共制造了五种土发电机，包括七十五瓩的机械整流发电机。
    现在，广大群众已把自制的土发电机，安装在城乡九百六十三个公社、一千多座中小型电站里，白天带动机器浇地、磨面、碾米、轧花……，夜晚，电灯光芒四射。社员们都喜笑颜开地歌颂美好的生活。
