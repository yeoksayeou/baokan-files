    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 7th: The Wuhan Automobile Factory has consistently adopted the method of quality analysis meetings this year to promptly resolve quality issues, resulting in continuous improvement in product quality. After two successive inspections and evaluations by the Quality Inspection Team of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the National Automobile Industry Inspection Team, it was determined that the factory's three main products—pistons, piston rings, and copper tiles—exceeded the quality levels of similar products nationwide. The factory's output of major products also completed half of the annual plan ahead of schedule.
    The quality analysis meetings at the Wuhan Automobile Factory are universally adopted at the factory, workshop, and team levels. The specific practice is: the factory-level quality analysis meeting is held once a week, chaired by the chief engineer, with the participation of the production director, technical section, inspection section, and relevant workshop leaders to analyze major quality issues of the week. For major problems that occur temporarily, a three-way combination approach is immediately adopted for handling. Quality analysis meetings in each workshop are held twice a week; the team holds meetings more frequently, holding meetings before and after each shift to comprehensively check output, quality, safety, and other issues.
    The greatest benefit of adopting quality analysis meetings is that it has turned the work of ensuring product quality into a system. It can extensively gather information, analyze causes, and take different measures according to different situations, so that quality problems can be resolved in a timely manner.
    The Wuhan Automobile Factory has consistently implemented a three-level inspection system of workers, inspectors, and team leaders in each workshop. In this system, the worker first inspects the first product they produce; then it is handed over to the inspector for inspection; and finally, after the team leader's inspection and confirmation that it is qualified, it is used as a standard sample for workers to produce according to the standards of this sample. Inspectors also conduct general surveys and spot checks on raw materials all the way to finished products at any time. Through this mass-based layer-by-layer inspection, the phenomenon of large-scale product scrapping has been greatly eliminated. From January to May this year, the scrap rate of cast iron parts in the factory decreased from 12.48% to 5.35%, and the scrap rate of machining decreased from 12.53% to 3.48%.

    坚持层层检查制度　采取开会分析方法
    武汉汽车厂产品质量不断提高
    据新华社武汉7日电　武汉汽车厂今年以来坚持采取质量分析会的方式，及时解决质量问题，使产品质量不断提高。经第一机械工业部质量检查团和全国汽车工业检查团先后两次检查评比，认为这个厂生产的三种主要产品活塞、活塞环、铜瓦都超过了全国同类产品质量水平。这个厂主要产品产量也提前完成了全年计划的一半。
    武汉汽车厂的质量分析会，分别在厂、车间和小组普遍采用。它的具体作法是：厂级质量分析会每周举行一次，由总工程师主持，生产厂长和技术科、检查科和有关车间领导干部都参加会议，来分析一周重大的质量问题；对于临时发生的重大问题，立即采用三结合的形式处理。各车间的质量分析会每周举行两次；小组举行的次数更多，每天班前班后开会，全面检查产量、质量和安全等问题。
    采取质量分析会最大的好处是，把保证产品质量的工作变成了制度。它能广泛地集中情况，分析原因，针对不同情况采取不同措施，使质量问题及时得到解决。
    武汉汽车厂在每个车间都一贯实行着工人、检验人员、小组长三级检查制度。在这个制度中，首先由工人对自己生产的头一件产品进行检查；然后再交给检查人员检查；最后经过小组长检查，认为合格后，就作为标准样品，交给工人按照这种样品的标准进行生产。检查人员还从原料材料一直到成品随时进行普查和抽查。经过这种群众性的层层检查，大大消除了产品大量报废的现象。今年1至5月，全厂铸铁件废品率由12.48％下降到5.35％，机械加工废品率由12.53％下降到3.48％。
