    This newspaper reports: Ren Zuxiong, the Party Branch Secretary of the Qunyi Production Team of Cihua People's Commune in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, personally serves as the director of the two canteen management committees in the team. He frequently goes to the kitchen and continuously improves the canteen work. As a result, the canteen is getting better and better, and the members are all satisfied.
    Ren Zuxiong's experience over the past year has given him a deep understanding that improving living standards is precisely for improving production, and the better the members eat, the greater their enthusiasm for production. Now, there are no idle people in the Qunyi team. Over the past year, the attendance of the members has always been "all red." This year's summer harvest crops have increased in area by more than double compared to last year, and the total output has increased by more than three times compared to last year; this year's planting of rice, cotton, and oil crops has also exceeded the plan in every aspect. Therefore, the members jointly posted twenty-seven big-character posters for Ren Zuxiong, praising his good work style. The members said: "Entrusting our homes to you is more reliable than an iron cabinet. The canteen is well managed, and our enthusiasm soars to the sky!"
    Relying on the poor peasants and uniting the masses is the main characteristic of Ren Zuxiong's leadership and successful canteen management. All seven Communist Party members, thirteen Communist Youth League members, and all cadres in the team make friends with the poor peasants, using this method to collect the opinions of the vast majority of members on how to run the canteen well. Ren Zuxiong also personally convenes a forum of poor and lower-middle peasants every half month to discuss with them how to arrange their lives, how to educate and unite the middle peasants, and how to run the canteen together. Therefore, the measures proposed by the canteen management committee each time are closely related to the demands of the vast majority of members; the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants have truly formed a leading advantage in the canteen. They take the lead in offering opinions, thinking of ways, abiding by the system, observing order, cherishing public property, paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and supervising management personnel, acting as masters in everything. Therefore, their public canteen is as stable as Mount Tai and is getting better and better.
    Going deep into the kitchen, discovering problems, and solving problems is another characteristic of Ren Zuxiong's leadership and successful canteen management. Once, Ren Zuxiong found that the rice was not very tasty, so he personally went to the kitchen, participated in cooking, and discussed ways to improve with the cooks. They changed their original method, and the steamed rice was fluffy, soft, fragrant, and delicious. The members praised it without exception after eating it. Ren Zuxiong paid special attention to vegetable planting. He said: "Vegetables, like grain, are the lifeblood of the canteen. Without vegetables, it is impossible to run the canteen well." He personally planted an experimental vegetable garden; he often discussed with the vegetable professional team how to intercrop and interplant to increase yields; when vegetables were short of fertilizer, he helped solve the fertilizer problem. Therefore, their vegetable garden is well planted. Last year, they planted more than a dozen varieties such as cabbage, black and white cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, amaranth, hot white cabbage, and radish, yielding 10,000 to 20,000 jin per mu. From last year to now, it has been evergreen all year round, with more than enough for self-sufficiency. Members eat a full three to four jin of vegetables per person per day, with two to three dishes per meal. In addition to supplying the surrounding water conservancy construction sites, schools, and institutions with the vegetables they cannot finish eating, they have also stored more than 20,000 jin of dried vegetables themselves.
    "Knowing life early" has become a system of the Qunyi Production Team. The canteen management committee routinely holds a life meeting once a week to check work, study the opinions raised by the masses, plan what to eat next, and publicize it to the masses in advance. This not only encourages the members but also enables the canteen to prepare early. Because Ren Zuxiong grasps production with one hand and life with the other, and takes the public canteen as the center, he also arranges other aspects of the members' collective life while running the public canteen well, so that the content of collective life becomes increasingly rich. Here, there are places for washing faces; there are bathrooms for bathing; there is a library for reading; there are places for resting. In the evening, learning and recreational activities begin, and the dining hall is both a classroom for the Red and Expert School and a good place for singing.

    党的好干部　群众知心友
    任祖雄深入细致办好食堂
    本报讯　据湖北日报报道：湖北省当阳县慈化人民公社群益生产队党支部书记任祖雄自己担任队里的两个食堂管理委员会的主任，他经常下厨房，不断改进食堂工作。因此，食堂越办越好，社员个个满意。
    任祖雄一年多来的经验，深深体会到，搞好生活，正是为了搞好生产，社员吃得好，生产干劲就越大。现在，群益队里无闲人。一年多来，社员的出勤总是“满堂红”。今年的夏收作物，面积比去年增加一倍多，总产量却比去年增加三倍多；今年水稻、棉花和油料作物的播种，也样样超过了计划。因此，社员联名给任祖雄贴了二十七张大字报，表扬他的好作风。社员说：“把家交给你们当，比铁打的柜子还保险，食堂办得好，我们干劲冲天！”
    依靠贫农，团结群众，是任祖雄领导和办好食堂的主要特点。全队七个共产党员、十三个共青团员和所有的干部，都和贫农交朋友，用这个办法来收集广大社员对办好食堂的意见。任祖雄每半月还亲自召开一次贫农，下中农座谈会，和他们商量怎么安排生活，怎么教育团结中农，共同把食堂办好。因此，食堂管委会每次所提出的措施，都和广大社员的要求丝丝入扣，紧密相关；广大贫农、下中农在食堂中真正地形成了领导优势，他们带头提意见，想办法，遵守制度，遵守秩序，爱护公共财物，注意清洁卫生，监督管理人员，事事当家做主。因此，他们的公共食堂稳若泰山，越办越好。
    深入厨房，发现问题解决问题，也是任祖雄领导和办好食堂的另一个特点。有一次，任祖雄发现饭做的有些不好吃，便亲自下厨房，参加做饭做菜，和炊事员一起商量改进的办法。他们改变了原来的做法，蒸出来的饭，又松又软，香甜可口，社员吃了，无不夸赞。任祖雄对种菜抓的特别紧。他说：“蔬菜和粮食一样，是食堂的命根子，没有菜就不可能办好食堂。”他亲自种了试验菜园；他经常和蔬菜专业组商量如何间作套种，提高产量；蔬菜缺肥的时候，他帮助解决肥料。所以，他们的菜园种得很好，去年种了白菜、黑白菜、莴苣、黄瓜、苋菜、热白菜、萝卜等十几样，每亩能收一万斤到两万斤。从去年到现在，四季常青，自给有余。社员每人每天足足吃到三、四斤菜，每餐都有两、三样菜。他们吃不完的菜，除了供给周围的水利工地、学校和机关以外，自己还储存了两万多斤干的。
    “生活早知道”，已成为群益生产队的制度，食堂管委会每星期照例召开一次生活会议，检查工作，研究群众提出的意见，计划下一步吃什么，提早向群众宣传。这样做，既鼓舞了社员，又使食堂能及早做好准备。由于任祖雄一手抓生产，一手抓生活，并以公共食堂为中心，在办好公共食堂的同时，对于社员集体生活的其他方面也加以安排，使集体生活的内容日益丰富起来。在这里，洗脸有洗脸处；洗澡有洗澡间；看书有图书室；休息有休息的地方。到了晚上，学习、娱乐活动开始了，饭厅既是红专学校的课堂，又是演唱的好地方。
