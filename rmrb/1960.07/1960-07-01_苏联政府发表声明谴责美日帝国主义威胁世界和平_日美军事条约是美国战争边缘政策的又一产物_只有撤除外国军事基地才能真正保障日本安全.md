Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch. TASS, Moscow, 29th Dispatch. The following is the full text of the Soviet government's statement on the "ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military treaty by the U.S. and Japanese governments:

    Recently, in the United States and Japan, a farce of ratifying the new U.S.-Japan military treaty was staged, disregarding the will of the Japanese people. This treaty is another monstrous product of the U.S. ruling clique's bankrupt policy—the policy of "brinkmanship," piecing together aggressive blocs, and setting up military bases on the territory of other countries.

    The U.S. ruling clique stubbornly opposes the unstoppable desire of all countries' people for lasting peace with its own line—undermining the resolution of mature international issues, destroying international trust, stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, and carrying out aggressive provocations against peace-loving countries. The U.S.-Japan treaty precisely serves this line, leading to a further intensification of the situation in the Far East.

    The conclusion of the new military treaty has aroused the indignation of the broadest masses of the Japanese people, who have been heroically struggling for years to end the American occupation of Japan and remove foreign military bases from Japanese territory. After the Japanese government signed the aforementioned treaty, this struggle developed into an unprecedented people's movement in Japan, which fundamentally shook the position of the pro-American Nobusuke Kishi regime. Therefore, the so-called ratification of the treaty was carried out under circumstances where the Nobusuke Kishi government unprecedentedly mocked the will of the people and used police violence against opposition party members who opposed the treaty. This is not accidental.

    The Japanese people gave the United States and its servants in Japan a practical lesson. They forced the U.S. President's special envoy to flee in disgrace and did not allow the U.S. President himself to set foot on Japanese soil. With this action, the Japanese people once again demonstrated that they are ready to defend the cause of peace and the independence of their country with all their might, and they reject the new military treaty signed against their will and despite their protests.

    After the Japanese people crossed out the documents they hated with their resolute actions, even some supporters of the U.S.-Japan alliance doubted whether the treaty could be considered legal and valid. However, it would be a mistake to underestimate the danger this collusion of the U.S.-Japan imperialist bloc poses to the cause of peace. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that it must once again point out the fatal consequences of the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military treaty for the Japanese people.

    According to this treaty, Japan grants the United States the right to maintain U.S. armed forces and military bases on Japanese territory. However, recent events have shown very clearly how dangerous it is for these or those countries to provide their territory to the United States for military bases. The U.S. government itself has admitted that it is U.S. policy to use these bases to invade the airspace of other countries.

    After the Soviet government issued those well-known statements, there should be no doubt that such acts of aggression by U.S. planes taking off from Japanese bases will not go unpunished. It is clear from this that the U.S.-Japan treaty, which turns Japanese territory into an American aircraft carrier, places Japan in an extremely dangerous situation.

    According to the new treaty, Japan undertakes the obligation to actively cooperate with the U.S. armed forces stationed in Japan. This means that Japanese foreign policy—and ultimately Japan's fate—has been inextricably linked to the United States' adventurous policy aimed against Japan's neighbors. U.S. Secretary of State Herter's presumptuous statement regarding the scope of the U.S.-Japan treaty perfectly illustrates this point. From this alone, it can be seen that the U.S.-Japan treaty turns Japan into a willing or unwilling accomplice of the United States' aggressive policy in the Far East.

    The collusion of the U.S.-Japan imperialist bloc undermines the foundation of peaceful and good relations between Japan and its neighbors, exacerbates tensions in the region, and creates an extremely dangerous hotbed of war threats. The reason why the U.S. ruling clique used the aforementioned treaty to tie Japan to the chariot of the U.S. aggressive policy is because they want to pull chestnuts out of the fire with other people's hands. They hope to prevent Japan from developing good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and to make Japan politically and economically completely subordinate to U.S. militarists and monopoly capital.

    This raises the question: What purpose do those groups in Japan who are responsible for Japan's foreign policy hope to achieve by pushing their country into a terrible adventure, sacrificing Japan's national sovereignty, and agreeing to prolong the humiliating U.S. occupation of Japan for a protracted period? Obviously, the aforementioned groups hope that through this treaty, with the support and promotion of the United States, they can revive militarism and re-engage in long-planned expansion plans. The U.S.-Japan aggressive bloc shamelessly tramples on all agreements and obligations regarding the elimination of Japanese militarism, and blatantly shouts that Japan will do everything possible to increase its military potential, expand its army, and develop its military industry. It is no coincidence that Japanese militarists and revanchists have become visibly rampant at the same time as the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan treaty.

    Of course, if the aggressors dare to infringe upon the security of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving socialist countries, the Soviet people have sufficient strength and means to give them a proper rebuff. However, the people of the world, including the Soviet people, cannot ignore the fact that Japan's militarist forces are rising again with the support of their protectors across the ocean. Everyone still remembers the atrocities of Japanese militarists who shed the blood of many countries in Asia and the Far East. The Japanese people will not forget this either, because they have paid a high price for the adventurous policies of the militarist groups that led the country to national disaster.

    The Soviet government, which has always pursued a policy of peace, has repeatedly warned the Japanese government, pointing out to it what dangers it is exposing its country and the Japanese people to by embarking on the fatal path of reviving militarism and engaging in military collusion with the United States for the purpose of aggression. The Soviet government has been and is still committed to the complete normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations, ensuring mutually beneficial trade, economic, cultural and other ties, and it is doing everything possible to do so.

    The Soviet people have no other intention towards their close neighbor Japan than to live in peace and friendship with it, and to cooperate with it on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Establishing genuine good-neighborly relations will undoubtedly benefit the peoples of both countries and will also be conducive to consolidating peace throughout the world.

    The broad patriotic circles of all sectors of Japanese society also understand this very well. Japan's most far-sighted political leaders have always believed that developing relations with the Soviet Union is of great significance. History will remember the activities of the late Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, who did a lot of work to establish mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. Unfortunately, the good foundation laid by the Hatoyama Cabinet in this regard has not been further developed. Some Japanese people's sober assessment of the situation has given way to dangerous plans to collude with the United States in order to pursue aggressive and adventurous policies.

    The Nobusuke Kishi government took a different path. He resisted the conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty and actually refused to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of October 19, 1956, to promote the development of mutual understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Japan for the benefit of peace and security in the Far East. The Nobusuke Kishi government subordinated its policy to the interests of American monopoly groups and the Pentagon, and stepped up its military collusion with the United States, which openly declared that carrying out aggressive provocations against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries was its national policy. In this way, Nobusuke Kishi and his like-minded people showed that they were unwilling to promote good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and did not want to contribute to the cause of strengthening peace in the Far East.

    Concluding a military treaty with the United States did not bring glory to the Nobusuke Kishi government. It only lowered Japan's international prestige, or rather, lowered the international prestige of those in Japan who had placed their bets on Nobusuke Kishi and his policies, and also undermined the trust of neighboring countries and other peace-loving countries in Japan. In Japan itself, the signing of this treaty has caused a deep political crisis. Mr. Nobusuke Kishi was spurned by the Japanese people and had to announce his resignation in disgrace.

    It can be seen from foreign press reports that some pro-American groups in Japan hope to use the change of cabinet to confuse the Japanese people in order to continue to implement policies that serve the interests of monopoly groups across the ocean. However, there is no doubt that those who attempt to continue to implement this bankrupt policy behind the backs of the Japanese people will meet the same shameful end as Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.

    History has many examples of what happened to treaties and alliances that were forced upon the people of this or that country against the will of the people and against the interests of the people. Such an alliance against the interests of the people cannot last long: the people cannot tolerate the foreign shackles placed around their necks. There is every reason to believe that the U.S.-Japan military alliance will end in a disgraceful way, just like the notorious Anti-Comintern Pact that linked militarist Japan with fascist Germany and Italy, or like the Baghdad Pact that was crushed by the Iraqi people not long ago.

    If Japan abandons its policy of participating in military alliances and removes foreign military bases from Japanese territory, it will be an important contribution to strengthening universal peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries. This will give Japan itself a real, not false, security guarantee. Japan's enemies are trying to groundlessly use the interests of security as an excuse to justify the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military treaty. However, who does not know now that this treaty will not only fail to guarantee Japan's security, but on the contrary, it will deepen Japan's danger of falling into a catastrophe, the tragic consequences of which will far exceed the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, exceeding all the disasters caused by Japan's defeat in World War II.

    No wonder some American journalists call this "joint defense treaty" a "joint suicide treaty." What can lay the foundation for peace and security in the Far East is not the opposition of some countries to others, not mutual hostility and the use of force, but close peaceful cooperation among all countries.

    The abolition of the U.S.-Japan military treaty will clear the way for the development of Soviet-Japanese relations, and will make it possible to solve without difficulty those practical problems between our two countries that have not been resolved under the current circumstances due to the Japanese government's unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union.

    Japan's pursuit of an independent and peace-loving policy is fully in line with the national interests of the Japanese people, and it will open up broad prospects for the peaceful life and prosperity of the Japanese people.

    This is not the first time for the Japanese people to oppose the colonialist intentions of American imperialism. As early as a hundred years ago, the United States used the cannons of Commodore Perry's "Black Ships" to force Japan to accept its first enslaving treaty. However, due to their persistent struggle, the Japanese people later finally abolished this treaty and many other unequal treaties concluded with colonial countries. There is no doubt that the Japanese people will also be able to find sufficient strength this time to get rid of the shameful foreign protection and the military treaty they hate. The sooner the Japanese people achieve this goal, the better it will be for Japan itself and for the entire cause of peace in the Far East.

### 苏联政府发表声明谴责美日帝国主义威胁世界和平  日美军事条约是美国战争边缘政策的又一产物  只有撤除外国军事基地才能真正保障日本安全

    苏联政府发表声明谴责美日帝国主义威胁世界和平
    日美军事条约是美国战争边缘政策的又一产物
    只有撤除外国军事基地才能真正保障日本安全
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日电，苏联政府就美国和日本政府“批准”美日军事条约发表的声明，全文如下：
    最近在美国以及在日本，不顾日本人民的意志，上演了批准新美日军事条约的丑剧。这个条约是美国统治集团已经破产的政策——“战争边缘”政策、拼凑侵略集团以及在别国领土上设置军事基地的政策的又一个畸形儿。
    美国统治集团顽固地用自己的路线——破坏成熟了的国际问题的解决、破坏国际信任、加紧备战、对爱好和平的国家进行侵略挑衅活动——来反对各国人民争取持久和平的不可遏止的愿望。美日条约正是服从于这条路线的，这个条约导致远东局势的进一步加剧。
    新军事条约的缔结引起了最广泛的日本人民的愤慨，他们为结束美国占领日本和撤除在日本领土上的外国军事基地已经英勇地进行了多年的斗争。日本政府签署了上述条约后，这个斗争发展成为日本空前的人民运动，这个运动从根本上动摇了岸信介亲美政权的阵地。因此，条约的所谓批准，是在岸信介政府史无前例地嘲弄人民的意志的情况下和在对反对这个条约的反对党议员采取警察暴力的情况下进行，这不是偶然的。
    日本人民给美国和它在日本的奴仆上了一堂实物课。他们迫使美国总统的特使不得不可耻地逃跑，并且根本不让美国总统本人踏上日本的土地。日本人民以这种行动再一次表明，他们准备用一切力量捍卫和平事业和自己国家的独立，他们拒绝违反他们的意志和不顾他们的抗议而签订的新的军事条约。
    在日本人民以自己的坚决行动勾掉了他们所憎恨的文件后，甚至日美同盟的拥护者中间也有人怀疑能否认为这个条约合法和有效。但是，如果对美日帝国主义集团的这次勾结给和平事业带来的危险性估计不足，那是错误的。因此，苏联政府认为必须再次指出美日军事条约的缔结给日本人民造成的致命后果。
    根据这个条约，日本向美国提供在日本领土上保持美国武装部队和军事基地的权利。然而，最近的事件极其鲜明地表明，这些或那些国家提供自己的领土给美国做军事基地，这有多么危险。美国政府自己也曾经承认，利用这些基地侵入别国领空是美国的国策。
    在苏联政府发表了大家知道的那些声明后，对美国飞机从日本基地起飞进行这种侵略活动不会不受到惩罚这点不致有任何怀疑了。从这里可以明显看出，把日本领土变成美国航空母舰的美日条约，把日本置于极其危险的境地。
    根据新条约，日本承担同驻扎在日本的美国武装部队实行积极合作的义务。这意味着，已经用死结把日本的外交政策——归根结底也是日本的命运，同旨在反对日本邻国的美国冒险政策结在一起了。美国国务卿赫脱关于美日条约有效范围的放肆的声明正好说明了这一点。仅从这一点就可以看出，美日条约把日本变成为美国在远东的侵略政策的有意或无意的共谋者。
    美日帝国主义集团的勾结破坏日本同它邻国之间和平和良好关系的基础，加剧这个地区的紧张局势，制造极其危险的战争威胁策源地。美国统治集团之所以用上述条约把日本捆上美国侵略政策的战车，是因为想借别人之手火中取栗，他们指望阻挠日本同苏联和中华人民共和国发展睦邻关系，使日本在政治上和经济上完全从属于美国黩武主义者和垄断资本。
    这就产生了一个问题，日本那些对日本的外交政策负责的集团，把自己的国家推向可怕的冒险，为此他们竟同意牺牲日本的国家主权，同意使日本受屈辱的美国占领旷日持久地延长下去，他们这样做是为了什么目的呢？显然，上述集团指望他们通过这个条约，在美国的支持和促进下，复活军国主义，重新着手实现酝酿已久的扩张计划。美日侵略集团厚颜无耻地践踏了关于肃清日本军国主义的一切协定和义务，明目张胆地叫嚷日本将全力增加自己的军事潜力，扩充军队，发展军事工业。在缔结美日条约的同时，日本的军国主义和复仇主义分子明显地猖狂起来，这不是偶然的。
    当然，如果侵略者胆敢侵犯苏联和其他爱好和平的社会主义国家的安全，苏联人民有足够的力量和手段给他们以应有的反击。但是，世界各国人民，其中包括苏联人民，不能忽视这样一个事实：日本的军国主义势力正在自己的大洋彼岸的保护者的支持下重新抬头。对日本黩武主义者使亚洲和远东许多国家流遍鲜血的暴行，大家都记忆犹新。日本人民也不会忘记这一点，因为他们曾为把国家导致民族浩劫的军国主义集团的冒险政策付出过高昂的代价。
    一贯奉行和平政策的苏联政府，曾经一再警告日本政府，向它指出，它走上复活军国主义和同美国实行以侵略为目的的军事勾结的致命道路，使自己的国家和日本人民遭到什么样的危险。苏联政府过去和现在一直致力于使苏日关系彻底正常化，保证互利的贸易经济联系、文化联系和其他联系，这样做是具有一切可能的。
    苏联人民对近邻日本没有什么其他意图，只是希望同它和平友好相处，在平等、互相尊重独立和主权、互不干涉内政的基础上同它合作。建立真正的睦邻关系无疑地会有利于两国人民，也同样有利于巩固全世界的和平。
    日本各界广大爱国人士也很了解这一点。日本的最有远见的政治领导人一贯认为发展同苏联的关系有很大的意义。历史会记着已故的首相鸠山一郎的活动，他对苏日之间建立互相谅解和友好关系做了不少工作。遗憾的是，由鸠山内阁在这方面所奠定的良好基础没有得到进一步的发展。某些日本人士对局势的清醒估计已让位于同美国勾结以便推行侵略和冒险政策的危险打算。
    岸信介政府走上了另一条路。他抵制缔结苏—日和约，实际上拒绝履行1956年10月19日苏—日联合宣言中规定的促使发展苏日之间的相互谅解和合作以利于远东和平和安全的义务。岸信介政府使自己的政策服从于美国垄断集团和五角大楼的利益，加紧在军事上同公开宣布对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家进行侵略挑衅是自己的国策的美国相勾结。这样，岸信介和他的思想一致的人就表明他们不愿意促使苏联和日本之间保持睦邻关系，不希望有助于加强远东和平的事业。
    同美国缔结军事条约没有给岸信介政府带来光彩。它只使日本的国际威信降低，更确切地说，使日本的那些在岸信介和他的政策身上下了赌注的人的国际威信降低，还破坏了邻国和其他爱好和平的国家对日本的信任。在日本本国，这个条约的签订引起了深刻的政治危机。岸信介先生为日本人民所唾弃，不得不可耻地宣布下台。
    从外国报纸的报道中可以看出，日本的某些亲美集团指望利用内阁的更换来迷惑日本人民，以便于继续执行为大洋彼岸垄断集团的利益效劳的政策。但是，不容置疑，企图瞒着日本人民继续执行这一破了产的政策的人将遭到同日本首相岸信介同样可耻的下场。
    历史上有不少例子，说明这个或那个国家违背人民的意愿、违背人民利益而强加在人民身上的条约和联盟得到了什么样的结果。这种违背人民利益的联盟是不能久存的：人民不能容忍套在他们脖子上的外国枷锁。有一切理由认为：美日军事联盟将会像把军国主义的日本同法西斯主义的德、意联结起来的臭名远扬的反共产国际公约一样，或者像不久以前被伊拉克人民粉碎的巴格达条约一样，落得一个不光彩的下场。
    如果日本放弃参加军事联盟的政策和撤除日本领土上的外国军事基地，那将是对加强普遍和平和各国人民之间的友谊的重要贡献。这样就会给日本自己建立真正的、而不是虚假的安全保障。日本人民的敌人企图毫无根据地以安全的利益作为借口替缔结美日军事条约辩解。但是，现在谁还不清楚，这个条约不仅不能保障日本的安全，而且相反，它会加深日本陷入浩劫的危险，这种浩劫的悲惨后果将远远超过广岛和长崎的惨剧，超过由于日本在第二次世界大战的失败而遭到的一切灾祸。
    无怪乎一些美国记者把这个“共同防御条约”称作“共同自杀条约”。能奠定远东的安宁和安全的不是一些国家同另一些国家的对立、不是彼此敌对和动用干戈，而是各国紧密的和平合作。
    废除美日军事条约将会为发展苏日关系扫清道路，将会使我们两国之间那些在目前情况下由于日本政府对苏联的不友好政策而未能得到解决的实际问题，没有困难地得到解决。
    日本奉行独立的爱好和平的政策，完全符合日本人民的民族利益，它将为日本人民的和平生活和繁荣开辟广阔前景。
    对日本人民来说，反对美国帝国主义的殖民主义意图，这不是初次。远在一百年前，美国曾用司令官佩利的“黑色舰队”的大炮，迫使日本接受第一个奴役性的条约。但是，日本人民由于坚持斗争，后来就终于废除了这个条约以及同殖民主义国家缔结的许多其他不平等的协定。毫无疑问，日本人民在这次也能找到足够的力量，来摆脱可耻的外国保护和他们所憎恨的军事条约。日本人民越快地达到这个目的，就会对日本自己，以及对远东的整个和平事业，越有好处。
