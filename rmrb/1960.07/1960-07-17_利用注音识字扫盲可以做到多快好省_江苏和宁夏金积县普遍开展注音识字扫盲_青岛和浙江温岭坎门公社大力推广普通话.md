Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province's pilot work on phonetic literacy in urban and rural areas has seen new developments. Several counties that started phonetic literacy trials earlier, such as Shuyang, Kunshan, and Xinyi, have expanded from pilot projects to widespread implementation.

　　In early May, Shuyang County formed a high tide of phonetic literacy learning, focusing on eliminating illiteracy. After a short period of phonetic literacy study, 200,000 young and middle-aged farmers, workers, and cadres, along with 100,000 primary and secondary school teachers, students, and other people, mastered the phonetic alphabet. Many could recognize, read, spell, and write, and began to use it for reading and writing practice. Many cities and counties such as Nanjing, Lianshui, Wuxian, and Yixing, while conducting pilot projects, focused on teacher training and textbook compilation, preparing for the full-scale promotion of phonetic literacy work in the province before and after the autumn harvest.

　　Jiangsu Province's phonetic literacy work began in some areas of Nanjing, Jiangpu, Xinyi, Kunshan, and Jintan cities and counties as early as 1958. Two years of practice have proven that using the phonetic alphabet to annotate Chinese characters can not only eliminate illiteracy more, faster, better, and more economically and prevent relapse into illiteracy but also ensure that the vast number of workers and peasants, after learning and mastering the phonetic literacy tool, can read and write a large amount of material without a teacher, thereby greatly shortening the length of time for spare-time education. Kunshan County recently promoted phonetic literacy among more than 30,000 relapsed illiterate students and quickly removed their illiterate labels again. At present, the proportion of non-illiterate people among young and middle-aged people in Kunshan County has reached over 91%.

　　Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province have strengthened their leadership over phonetic literacy work. Shuyang County has established phonetic literacy experimental fields at all levels throughout the county, and every team has set up Chinese phonetic alphabet learning classes. The county party committee also organized a work group of more than 100 people to go to the countryside to assist the communes and teams in carrying out phonetic literacy and illiteracy eradication work.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: Jinji County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is actively carrying out a phonetic literacy and illiteracy eradication campaign. At present, the county has established 224 phonetic literacy and illiteracy eradication classes, with more than 11,600 people participating, accounting for 95% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the county who should be enrolled in school. In the county's three communes and 23 brigades, the faster learners have learned all the letters and entered the stage of intensive study of new characters; the slower learners have also learned the initials and simple vowels.

　　In carrying out the phonetic literacy and illiteracy eradication movement, the Jinji County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has made unified arrangements and specific leadership for illiteracy eradication learning, and requires cadres at all levels to grasp cultural learning while grasping production and life, so as to achieve unified leadership over production and learning. For example, at the county-wide oath-taking rally for rice transplanting broadcasting, the county party committee emphasized grasping phonetic literacy learning while deploying rice transplanting tasks. Led by Song Lianke, secretary of the county party committee secretariat, a thousand-person phonetic literacy and illiteracy eradication work group composed of cadres and students supporting rice transplanting production was organized to go to various communes, brigades, and teams to serve as phonetic literacy propagandists and teachers while participating in rice transplanting. All cadres in the county, from members of the county party committee to every team cadre, actively participated in the study of the phonetic alphabet, and they participated in the learning wherever they went when working in the teams.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: On the basis of widely and deeply promoting the phonetic literacy movement, Qingdao City is launching a mass movement to learn and promote Mandarin.

　　Since the city held a mobilization meeting in late May, counties and districts under Qingdao City have successively held leap forward meetings, report meetings, and broadcast meetings for mobilization, and used films, slides, and street propaganda to conduct widespread and in-depth publicity. A trend of everyone learning to speak Mandarin has formed among the masses. At present, 840,000 people in the city have joined the movement to learn and promote Mandarin.

　　Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of promoting Mandarin, and most factory and enterprise party committees have included this work on their agenda. The party committee secretaries and factory directors of Shinan and Taixi districts, as well as Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 and Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory, took the lead in learning. In the movement to learn to speak Mandarin, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in Qingdao City have fully played their organizational and leading role. More than 90% of the members of the Communist Youth League in Shinan District have joined the movement to learn to speak Mandarin, and they have also organized a propaganda team of more than 1,000 young people to go to various streets, shops, and residential courtyards to teach Mandarin. All primary schools in the city have also fully played an active role in the promotion of Mandarin.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Kanmen Commune in Wenling, Zhejiang Province, has achieved remarkable results in vigorously promoting Mandarin in conjunction with illiteracy eradication.

　　At present, more than 90% of the young and middle-aged people in the commune have learned Mandarin. Originally, the announcers of the local radio station had to broadcast weather programs and news in four languages: Fujian dialect, Wenzhou dialect, Taiping dialect, and Mandarin. Teachers had to use three or four dialects to explain texts in the classroom, and leading cadres had to bring several translators with them to conduct work when going to the grassroots level to inspect work. But since the vigorous promotion of Mandarin, this situation has changed.

　　The main experience of this extremely complex dialect area in rapidly changing language habits and popularizing Mandarin is: first, to put politics in command and launch a mass movement to learn Mandarin. The Kanmen Commune Party Committee regards the promotion of Mandarin as a political task, and established a research group to promote the speaking of Mandarin. Cadres took the lead, and all meetings and reports were given in Mandarin. Mandarin learning competitions were launched between production teams. And people's schools were used as a base to carry out a nationwide movement to learn Mandarin.

    据新华社南京讯　江苏省城乡注音识字试点工作有了新的发展，几个试行注音识字较早的沭阳、昆山、新沂等县，已由点到面普遍推开。
    沭阳县在5月初就形成了一个以扫除文盲为重点的注音识字学习高潮。全县二十万青壮年农民、职工、干部和十万中小学师生、群众，参加了短时间的注音识字学习以后，已有十五万人掌握了拼音字母，不少人会认会读会拼会写，并开始运用它来阅读和练习写作。南京、涟水、吴县、宜兴等许多市县，在进行试点的同时，抓了师资培训和教材编写工作，为秋收前后在全省全面推开注音识字工作做好准备。
    江苏省注音识字工作，早在1958年就在南京、江浦、新沂、昆山、金坛等市、县部分地区推行。两年实践证明，利用拼音字母为汉字注音，不仅可以多快好省地扫除文盲，杜绝扫盲的回生复盲，而且可以保证广大工农群众在学习和掌握了拼音识字工具以后，无师自通地大量阅读和写作，从而大大缩短了业余教育教学年限。昆山县最近在三万多复盲学员中推行注音识字，很快使他们又摘掉了文盲帽子。目前昆山全县青壮年中，非文盲的比例已达91％以上。
    江苏省各级党委已加强了对注音识字工作的领导。沭阳县全县层层都建立了注音识字试验田，队队都开办了汉语拼音学习班，县委还组织了一百多人的工作组下乡协助社队进行注音识字扫盲工作。
    据新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区金积县积极开展注音识字扫盲运动。现在全县已办起注音识字扫盲班二百二十四个，参加学习的有一万一千六百多人，占全县应入学青壮年总人数的95％。全县三个公社二十三个大队，学习快的已学完全部字母，进入突击生字阶段；慢的也学会了声母和单韵母。
    在开展注音扫盲运动中，中共金积县委对扫盲学习都作了统一安排和具体领导，并要求各级干部在抓生产、生活的同时，抓好文化学习，做到对生产、学习统一领导。例如在全县插秧广播誓师大会上，县委在布置插秧任务的同时，就强调抓好注音识字学习。并以县委书记处书记宋连科为首，组织支援插秧生产的干部和学生成立了一个千人注音识字扫盲工作团，分赴各公社、大队、小队，在参加插秧的同时，担任注音识字宣传员和教师的工作。全县从县委委员到每个队干，都积极参加了拼音字母的学习，他们在下队工作时，走到哪里就参加哪里的学习。
    据新华社济南讯　在广泛深入推广注音识字运动的基础上，青岛市正在开展一个学习和推广普通话的群众运动。
    自5月下旬全市召开了动员大会以后，青岛市所属各县、区都先后召开了跃进会、报告会、广播会等进行了动员，并利用电影、幻灯和街头宣传等形式进行广泛深入的宣传。在广大群众中已形成了人人学说普通话的风气。目前，全市已有八十四万人投入了学习推广普通话运动。
    各级党委对推广普通话工作都非常重视，大部分工厂企业党委把这项工作列入议事日程。市南、台西两个区委以及青岛国棉一厂、青岛印染厂党委书记、厂长都带头学习。在学说普通话运动中，青岛市的各级共青团组织充分发挥了组织和带头作用。市南区有90％以上的共青团员投入了学说普通话运动，他们还组织了一千多名青少年的宣传队伍分赴各街头、商店、居民大院教说普通话。全市各小学在推广普通话运动中也都充分发挥积极作用。
    据新华社杭州讯　浙江省温岭坎门公社结合扫盲大力推广普通话，已取得了显著成绩。
    现在全社90％以上的青壮年学会了普通话，原来这里广播站的播音员在播送气象节目和新闻时，要用福建话、温州话、太平话、普通话四种话播音；教师在课堂上也要用三、四种方言来讲解课文，领导干部下到基层去检查工作要带几个翻译才能进行工作。但自从大力推广普通话后，这情况就改变了。
    这个极其复杂的方言地区，能迅速地改变语言习惯，普及了普通话的主要经验：首先是政治挂帅，大搞学普通话的群众运动。坎门公社党委把推广普通话作为一项政治任务，成立推广讲普通话工作研究小组，干部带头，开会报告都讲普通话，生产队之间开展学普通话竞赛。并以民校为阵地，开展全民学习普通话运动。
