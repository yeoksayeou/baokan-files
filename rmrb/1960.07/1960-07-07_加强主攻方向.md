    Strengthen the Main Attack Direction

    Xin'gan County fixed 75% of the county's labor force on the agricultural front as the main force in agriculture; fixed 5% of the labor force on the iron and steel front to form a professional team for smelting and transportation; and used about 20% of the labor force as a "reserve team" for flexible use between agriculture and industry. The specific proportions of labor allocation may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each region, but the spirit of this approach—strengthening agriculture with the main force, while flexibly mobilizing according to actual needs—is applicable in all regions.

    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. In rural people's communes, agriculture is the center of the "five occupations". In agricultural production, it is necessary to "take grain as the key link and make overall arrangements." In the relationship between production measures for increasing grain production and capital construction, current production measures should be given top priority. Therefore, various measures taken to strive for a bumper harvest are often the main direction of attack on the agricultural front. This is true for summer and autumn, and also for winter and spring, but the specific proportion of labor allocation may be slightly different.

    Farming is dealing with nature. Changes in floods, droughts, winds, and frosts are extremely great, almost like changes in the enemy's situation on the battlefield. In order to cope with situations that are difficult to fully predict in advance, in addition to concentrating superior forces on the main direction of attack, it is absolutely necessary to appropriately control a portion of the "reserve team" to meet emergency needs. The "reserve team" is generally used in the main direction of attack, and sometimes it is used in secondary directions, but the purpose is still to ensure the victory of the main direction of attack. In this sense, Xin'gan County's experience in organizing, allocating, and commanding 20% of the "reserve team" is very good.

### 加强主攻方向

    加强主攻方向
    新干县把全县75％的劳动力固定在农业战线上，作为农业主力军；把5％的劳动力固定在钢铁战线上，组成冶炼、运输的专业队伍；以20％左右的劳动力作为“预备队”，在农业、工业间机动使用，这种劳力分配的具体比例，虽因各地的具体情况而有所不同，但这种作法的精神——以主要力量加强农业，同时按照实际需要灵活调动，在各个地区都可适用。
    农业是国民经济的基础。在农村人民公社中，农业是“五业”的中心。在农业生产中，要“以粮为纲，全面安排”。在增产粮食的生产措施和基本建设的关系上，当前的生产措施应该摆在首位。因此，为了争取丰收而采取的各种措施，经常是农业战线上的主攻方向。夏秋如此，冬春亦然，只不过劳力调配的具体比例，可以稍有不同罢了。
    种庄稼是跟大自然打交道。水旱风霜变化极大，简直跟战场上敌情变化差不多。为了应付事先难以完全预料的情况，除了集中优势兵力于主攻方向以外，适当控制一部分“预备队”以应急需，是完全必要的。“预备队”一般是用在主攻方向，有时候也会用在次要方向，但目的还是为了保证主攻方向的胜利。从这个意义上说，新干县组织、调配和指挥20％的“预备队”的经验是很好的。
