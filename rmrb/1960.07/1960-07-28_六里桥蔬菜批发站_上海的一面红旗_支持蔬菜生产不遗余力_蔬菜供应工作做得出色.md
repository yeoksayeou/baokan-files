Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: The employees of the Liuliqiao Vegetable Wholesale Station in Pudong County, Shanghai, have fully utilized their subjective initiative to promote a great leap forward in vegetable production in the People's Communes and have excellently completed their procurement and sales tasks in the first half of this year, becoming a distinct banner in Shanghai's agricultural and sideline product purchasing departments.

In the first half of this year, the unit area yield of vegetables in the Yanqiao Commune, which was supported by the wholesale station, increased by 10% compared with the same period last year; the vegetables supplied by the wholesale station to urban菜 markets reached 640,000 dan (担, a unit of weight), the highest level in the first half of any year; the variety of supplies increased from 62 last year to 78, ensuring the needs of the market.

The Liuliqiao Wholesale Station is responsible for purchasing vegetables produced by the nearby Yanqiao People's Commune and supplying them to 65菜 markets in the urban area. With the increasing demand for vegetables from urban residents, the daily supply task of the wholesale station has also increased from more than 3,500 dan last year to more than 4,500 dan. Initially, there was no complete agreement among the employees on whether they could complete such a heavy supply task. Some people believed that the amount of goods available was a matter for the commune, and the wholesale station could only collect as much as was available and supply as much as was collected. However, most people believed that as long as they wholeheartedly supported production, the supply would be guaranteed. The Party organization of the wholesale station promptly mobilized the employees to conduct theoretical debates, criticize the former opinion, and take a series of measures to support the development of vegetable production.

First of all, the wholesale station placed all its activities under the direct leadership of the commune's Party committee, reporting its work plans, work progress, and problems to the Party committee, and carrying out its work around the commune's production center at each stage. All 25 liaison officers of the station, led by the stationmaster, went to the production teams to work alongside the commune members, discussed matters together, and planted 42 mu (亩, a unit of area) of experimental fields with the production team cadres and commune members. The liaison officers launched a red flag competition of "one hand for multiple purposes, being a good six-role member for the commune," striving to be not only liaison officers of the wholesale station, but also regulators who helped the production teams adjust the amount of vegetables on the market and arrange transportation, statisticians who collected various data, instructors who assisted in exchanging production experience and imparting technology, purchasers who helped purchase various means of production and daily necessities, propagandists who publicized the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and various policies, and even, utilizing the convenience of their work, transmitting documents and notices, and serving as correspondents for the commune. Through these activities, the work of the wholesale station was deeply rooted among the broad masses of commune members.

"Seeing far ahead and grasping things early" is an important experience of the Liuliqiao Vegetable Wholesale Station in participating in production and ensuring supply. Their work is always ahead of the production season. For example, when arranging the production of autumn harvest crops in May, they considered that September is the typhoon season and vegetable production might be affected, so they assisted the production teams in preparing enough seeds and materials for drought resistance and flood prevention as early as possible.

Because of the great development of diversified operations in Yanqiao Commune, the original land was not enough. The wholesale station actively assisted the commune in fully exploring the potential of the land. During the spring sowing this year, the Pudong County Party Committee instructed the commune to produce 14,900 mu of vegetables, but according to the existing land area, only 14,388 mu could be planted. The liaison officers of the wholesale station went deep into the fields and, together with the commune members, found out about the land utilization situation, "seizing every opportunity," and found 468 mu of arable land from the "ten sides" such as roadsides and riverside and idle land requisitioned by factories, and planted vegetables in other crop fields, finally implementing the vegetable production area arranged by the county party committee. At the same time, the wholesale station also adopted the method of "four arrangements and three implementations" to assist the commune in implementing the plan at all levels and carrying it through to the end. The four arrangements are arranging area, arranging variety, arranging sowing date, and arranging rotation sowing according to the labor force, soil, and farming habits of each production team. The three implementations are the implementation of the plan, the implementation of the area, and the implementation of the variety. While helping the commune arrange the production of commercial vegetables, they also helped the rural public canteens to grow their own vegetables, so that commercial vegetables were even more guaranteed.

The station also earnestly helped the commune solve the difficulties in production. For example, when the commune had insufficient labor, the employees helped with sowing, building sheds, and weeding; when the pests were serious in the fields, they went to the fields to catch insects. As the amount of vegetables on the market increased, more packaging containers were needed. In addition to helping repair damaged vegetable baskets and cleaning up and concentrating scattered ones, they also sent people to the urban area to learn the technology of weaving straw rope bags and taught it to the commune members when they returned.

The Liuliqiao Wholesale Station also strengthened the great cooperation between production, wholesale, and retail links, further gathering the strength of the three parties to promote production development and do a good job in market supply. The specific approach is to unify the菜 market purchasers, the liaison officers of the wholesale station, and the salespersons of the production team, "three members combined into one." Everyone has a division of labor to understand the production situation of each production team and organize the vegetables to be put on the market. The three parties communicate with each other and support each other. When there are many weeds in the fields and the production team cannot spare time to weed, the菜 market sends people to support; when the菜 market needs to increase the quantity and variety of vegetables on the market, the production team also tries its best to organize the supply.

    六里桥蔬菜批发站—上海的一面红旗
    支持蔬菜生产不遗余力  蔬菜供应工作做得出色
    据新华社上海27日电　上海市浦东县六里桥蔬菜批发站职工充分发挥主观能动作用，促进人民公社蔬菜生产大跃进，出色地完成了今年上半年的购销任务，成为上海农副产品采购部门一面鲜明的旗帜。
    今年上半年，这个批发站所支援的严桥公社的蔬菜单位面积产量，比去年同期增加10％；批发站供应市区菜市场的蔬菜达到六十四万担，为历年上半年的最高水平；供应的品种由去年的六十二种增加到七十八种，保证了市场的需要。
    六里桥批发站负责收购附近严桥人民公社生产的蔬菜，供应市区六十五个菜场。随着城市人民对蔬菜的需要不断增加，批发站每天的供应任务也由去年的三千五百余担增加到四千五百余担。对于能否完成这样繁重的供应任务，起初职工们的认识上不完全一致，有些人认为：货源多、少、有、无是公社的事情，批发站只能来多少收多少，收多少供应多少。但是，多数人认为：只要全心全意支持生产，供应就有保证。批发站党组织及时发动职工，进行务虚辩论，批判了前一种意见，采取了一系列的措施，支持蔬菜生产发展。
    批发站首先把自己的一切活动置于公社党委的直接领导之下，将工作计划、工作情况和问题向党委汇报，围绕公社每一时期的生产中心开展工作。全站二十五个联络员，在站长的带头下，到生产队同社员一起劳动，有事共同商量，与生产队干部和社员一起种了四十二亩试验田。联络员开展了“一手多面，为公社当好六大员”的红旗竞赛，人人做到不仅是批发站的联络员，而且是帮助生产队调剂上市量和安排运输的调剂员，统计各种资料的统计员，协助交流生产经验和传授技术的指导员，帮助购买各种生产资料和生活用品的采购员，宣传“八字宪法”和各项政策的宣传员，甚至利用工作上的方便，传递文件、通知，担任公社的通讯员。通过这些活动，批发站的工作在广大社员中深深地扎下了根。
    “看得远，抓得早”，是六里桥蔬菜批发站参与生产，保证供应的一项重要经验。他们的工作都赶在生产季节前头。如在5月份安排秋收作物的生产时，他们考虑到9月份是台风季节，蔬菜生产可能受到影响，于是协助各生产队及早备足种子和抗旱防涝用的器材。
    严桥公社由于多种经营的大发展，原有土地不够用，批发站积极协助公社充分挖掘土地潜力。今年春播时，中共浦东县委布置公社生产一万四千九百亩蔬菜，可是，根据现有土地面积，只能种一万四千三百八十八亩。批发站的联络员便深入田间，和社员一起，摸清土地利用情况，“见缝插针”，从路边、河边等“十边”和工厂征用的闲置地，找到了可耕面积四百六十八亩，并在其他作物田里插种、间种蔬菜，终于把县委布置的蔬菜生产面积安排落实。同时，批发站又采取“四安排、三落实”的办法，协助公社使计划层层落实，贯彻到底。四安排是根据各生产队的劳力、土壤和耕作习惯，排面积、排品种、排下种日期、排轮作播种。三落实是计划落实、面积落实和品种落实。他们在帮助公社安排商品蔬菜生产同时，还帮助农村公共食堂种好自己吃的蔬菜，这样就使商品菜更加有了保障。
    这个站还切实帮助公社解决生产中的困难。如当公社劳动力不足时，职工们帮助下种、搭棚、除草；田间虫害严重时，又到田里捉虫。由于蔬菜上市量扩大，需要更多的包装容器，他们除了帮助把损坏的菜篮修好，失散的清理集中以外，又派人到市区学习编结草绳袋的技术，回来传授给社员。
    六里桥批发站还加强生产、批发、零售各环节之间的大协作，进一步把三方面的力量汇集起来，促进生产发展，做好市场供应工作。具体做法是：菜场采购员、批发站联络员同生产队的推销员统一组织起来，“三员合一”。大家分工包干了解各生产队的生产情况，组织蔬菜上市。三方面互通声息，互相支援。当田里杂草多，生产队一时抽不出人除草时，菜场就派人支援；菜场需要增加蔬菜上市数量和品种，生产队也尽力组织供应。
