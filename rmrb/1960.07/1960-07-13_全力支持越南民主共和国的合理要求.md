Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country replied to Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on July 11, stating that our government fully agrees with and fully supports the solemn demands he made in his letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on June 24. These demands call on the two chairmen to instruct the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam to revoke the resolution allowing U.S. military personnel to enter South Vietnam, to stop all U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam; to revoke the resolution that considers the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" of the South Vietnamese authorities as irrelevant to the Geneva Accords and does not intervene, to stop the persecution of former resistance members in South Vietnam, and to guarantee the implementation of Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam.

Anyone familiar with the Geneva Accords and concerned about peace in Indochina will readily understand that the two resolutions of the International Commission on Vietnam regarding the permission for U.S. military personnel to enter South Vietnam and regarding the South Vietnamese authorities' fascist Ordinance No. 10 are erroneous and dangerous. They not only fundamentally violate the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Accords, but also encourage U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, who are undermining the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and creating tension in Indochina, allowing them to carry out war preparations even more unscrupulously. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's request that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference instruct the International Commission to reconsider and revoke the above-mentioned erroneous resolutions and take measures to stop the crimes of those who are undermining the Geneva Accords is entirely reasonable.

It has been almost six years since the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, due to the deliberate obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not yet been realized, and peace in Vietnam and Indochina remains unstable. For six years, U.S. imperialism has continuously undermined the Geneva Accords. One of the most serious actions is the evil activity of expanding military preparations in South Vietnam through the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group." In order to realize its conspiracy to permanently occupy South Vietnam and turn it into its base of aggression, U.S. imperialism has not only colluded with the South Vietnamese authorities to illegally dispatch the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," but also continuously increased the military personnel of this advisory group. The military personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" have increased from 200 at the beginning of the armistice to more than 2,000 now. They are distributed in various military departments in South Vietnam, laying a net to control the entire South Vietnam. Under the guise of "assistance," the United States has illegally imported various new weapons, ammunition, and other items into South Vietnam. According to statistics from the Vietnamese "People's Daily," from 1955 to the end of 1959, U.S. warships illegally transporting large quantities of weapons and war materials into South Vietnam numbered 512. Under the planning and supervision of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," the United States has expanded and built many military bases in South Vietnam, including 46 air force bases and 11 naval bases. The personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" also directly command the South Vietnamese army to conduct bloody "sweeps" against the people, and direct them to launch armed provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia. Therefore, in order to maintain peace in the Indochina region and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, it is necessary to take measures to stop all U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam and force the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" to withdraw. However, the International Commission for Vietnam, which is responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, has not only failed to take timely and effective measures to stop the crimes of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords, but its Indian and Canadian representatives, disregarding the repeated accusations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the firm opposition of the Polish representative, have instead passed an erroneous resolution allowing the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" to increase military personnel in South Vietnam. Such an erroneous action is of course absolutely unacceptable to all Vietnamese people.

The cruel suppression of former resistance members in South Vietnam and the persecution of the broad masses of patriotic people is another important aspect of the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords and plotting to permanently divide Vietnam. In the past six years, more than 210,000 people have been arrested, more than 16,000 people have been injured, and more than 6,900 people have been killed in South Vietnam. The fascist Ordinance No. 10 promulgated by the South Vietnamese authorities in 1959 is a concrete step taken by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group to massively persecute and slaughter former resistance members in South Vietnam, suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the broad masses of people, and blatantly undermine the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the erroneous resolution on this ordinance passed by the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Commission actually exonerates the U.S.-Ngo group from its crimes of barbarously suppressing former resistance members and patriotic people in South Vietnam, and affixes a "legal" label to the Ngo Dinh Diem group's guillotine.

It must be pointed out that U.S. imperialism's attempt to cover up its conspiracy to send a large number of military personnel to South Vietnam under the guise of "rotating" the French expeditionary forces that should have been withdrawn and have already been withdrawn, and the increasingly intensified activities of the U.S.-Ngo group to undermine the Geneva Accords, are inseparable from the entire conspiracy of the United States to step up its military expansion and war preparations in the Far East and intensify the tense situation. Under such circumstances, reconsidering and revoking the erroneous resolutions of the International Commission for Vietnam that greatly facilitate the aggressors, and stopping the increasingly serious crimes of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords, are of particularly important significance. As our Foreign Minister Chen pointed out: Realizing the legitimate demands put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be conducive to easing the current tense situation in Indochina. In order to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to maintain peace in Indochina, we hope that the countries concerned will seriously consider the just demands of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and make beneficial contributions.

The solemn demands put forward by Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference are fully in line with the interests and aspirations of the Vietnamese people. At present, the movement of the people in North Vietnam against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem is flourishing. According to incomplete statistics, from June 29 to July 6, more than 800,000 people in various parts of North Vietnam held rallies and demonstrations, strongly opposing U.S. imperialism's policy of military expansion, war preparations, and aggression, and severely condemning the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam. People from all walks of life have submitted protest letters to the International Commission for Vietnam, denouncing the heinous crimes committed by the U.S.-Ngo group in South Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission re-examine its erroneous conclusions on the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" of the South Vietnamese authorities, and demanding that the U.S. aggressors get out of South Vietnam. The Chinese people fully support the just demands of the fraternal Vietnamese people, and firmly believe that the sacred aspiration of the Vietnamese people to drive out the U.S. aggressors and peacefully reunify their motherland will surely be realized.

### 全力支持越南民主共和国的合理要求

    全力支持越南民主共和国的合理要求
    我国外交部长陈毅7月11日复信越南民主共和国外交部长范文同，表示我国政府完全同意并且全力支持他在6月24日给日内瓦会议两位主席信中所提出的严正要求，要求两位主席指示越南国际监察和监督委员会撤销关于允许美国军事人员进入越南南方的决议，制止美帝国主义对越南南方的一切干涉；撤销认为越南南方当局“1959年第十号法令”与日内瓦协议无关、而不加干预的决议，制止对越南南方的前抗战人员的迫害，保证关于在越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款的履行。
    任何熟悉日内瓦协议和关心印度支那和平的人们，都不难了解越南国际委员会关于允许美国军事人员进入越南南方、关于越南南方当局第十号法西斯法令的两项决议，是错误的和危险的决议。它不仅根本违反日内瓦协议的规定和精神，而且对破坏越南的和平统一、制造印度支那紧张局势的美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团起了鼓励的作用，使它们得以更加肆无忌惮地进行备战活动。因此，越南民主共和国要求日内瓦会议两位主席指示越南国际委员会重新考虑和取消上述的错误决议，采取措施制止日内瓦协议破坏者的罪行，是完全合理的。
    印度支那和平恢复已经快六年了。但是由于美帝国主义的蓄意阻挠和破坏，越南的和平统一至今不得实现，越南和印度支那的和平始终处于不稳定的状态。六年来，美帝国主义曾不断对日内瓦协议进行破坏，最严重的行动之一就是通过“美国军事援助顾问团”在越南南方进行扩军备战的罪恶活动。美帝国主义为了实现它永远霸占越南南方和把越南南方变成它的侵略基地的阴谋，不仅与越南南方当局互相勾结，非法地派遣“美国军事援助顾问团”，而且不断地增加这个顾问团的军事人员。“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员，已由停战初期的二百人增加到现在的二千多人。他们分布在越南南方的各个军事部门，布下了控制整个越南南方的罗网。美国以“援助”为名，把各种新式武器、弹药等非法输入越南南方。据越南“人民报”统计，从1955年到1959年末，仅运输大批武器和战争物资非法进入越南南方的美国军舰就有五百十二艘次。在“美国军事援助顾问团”的策划和监督下，美国在越南南方扩建和新建了许多军事基地，其中包括空军基地四十六个、海军基地十一个。“美国军事援助顾问团”的人员还直接指挥越南南方军队对人民进行血腥的“扫荡”，指使他们向越南民主共和国和柬埔寨王国发动武装挑衅。因之，为了维护印度支那地区的和平，保证日内瓦协议在越南的实施，必须采取措施制止美帝国主义对越南南方的一切干涉，迫使“美国军事援助顾问团”撤走。然而，负责监察和监督日内瓦协议在越南实施的越南国际委员会，非但未能对此及时采取有效措施，制止美国和南越当局破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，它的印度和加拿大代表竟不顾越南民主共和国的一再指控和波兰代表的坚决反对，反而通过关于允许在越南南方的“美国军事援助顾问团”增加军事人员的错误决议，这种错误行动当然是全体越南人民所绝对不能同意的。
    残酷镇压越南南方前抗战人员、迫害广大爱国人民，是美帝国主义和越南南方当局破坏日内瓦协议、阴谋长期分割越南的罪行的另一个重要的方面。六年来，在越南南方已有二十一万多人遭到逮捕，一万六千多人受伤，六千九百多人被杀害。而越南南方当局颁行的1959年第十号法西斯法令，更是美国—吴庭艳集团为大规模迫害和屠杀越南南方前抗战人员、压制广大人民的爱国正义斗争、明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议而采取的一个具体步骤。因此，越南国际委员会印、加代表通过的关于这一法令的错误决议，实际上是替美吴集团野蛮镇压越南南方前抗战人员和爱国人民的罪行开脱责任，为吴庭艳集团的铡头机贴上“合法”的标韱。
    必须指出，美帝国主义企图以“轮换”应该撤走和早已撤走的法国远征军为名，掩护它向越南南方派遣大批军事人员的阴谋；美吴集团比任何时候都更加紧活动破坏日内瓦协议，是同美国在远东加紧扩军备战活动、加剧紧张局势的整个阴谋分不开的。在这样的情况下，重新考虑和取消越南国际委员会为侵略者大开方便之门的错误决议，制止美国和越南南方当局变本加厉地破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，就具有格外重要的意义。正如我国陈外长所指出的：实现越南民主共和国提出的合理要求，将有利于和缓目前印度支那的紧张局势。为了保证日内瓦协议的实施，为了维护印度支那的和平，我们希望有关的国家都能认真考虑越南民主共和国的正义要求，作出有益的贡献。
    范文同外长在给日内瓦会议两位主席信中提出的严正要求是完全符合越南人民的利益和愿望的。目前，越南北方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的运动，正在蓬勃发展。据不完全的统计，从6月29日起到7月6日止，越南北方各地已有八十多万人举行集会和示威游行，强烈反对美帝国主义的扩军备战和侵略政策，严厉谴责美国—吴庭艳集团在越南南方的罪行。各阶层人民纷纷向越南国际委员会递交抗议书，痛斥美吴集团在越南南方犯下的滔天罪行，要求国际委员会重新审查它对“美国军事援助顾问团”和越南南方当局“1959年第十号法令”所作出的错误结论，并且要求美国侵略者滚出越南南方。中国人民全力支持兄弟的越南人民的正义要求，并且坚决相信，越南人民赶走美国侵略者，和平统一祖国的神圣愿望一定能够实现。
