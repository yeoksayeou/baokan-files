    From Shangganling to the Fujian Front

    ——Watching the Documentaries "Exposing the U.S. Imperialist Paper Tiger" and "Ten Thousand Cannons Bomb the God of Plague"
    Wen Zonghua

    "Exposing the U.S. Imperialist Paper Tiger" is a film reflecting the people of the capital visiting the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea War Hall of the Revolutionary Military Museum during "Anti-U.S. Propaganda Week." As China and the Asian people are launching a storm of opposition to U.S. imperialist aggression and Eisenhower's bandit trip, it is very meaningful for us to revisit the entire history of the Korean War.

    The film narrates the heroic anti-imperialist struggle history of the Chinese and Korean people with a large number of physical objects and pictures. Ten years ago, the warmonger Dulles personally ignited the long-planned war of aggression against Korea at the 38th parallel. The U.S. bandits, armed to the teeth, gathered the armies of fourteen vassal countries, using the most modern equipment, attempting to destroy Korea and invade our country in the shortest possible time, thereby launching an attack on the entire socialist camp. They were truly ferocious and arrogant. However, the valiant Chinese and Korean People's Armies, shoulder to shoulder, raised the righteous iron fist of anti-aggression, and severely taught the U.S. imperialist, an aggressor by nature, in battles such as Yunshan, Changjin Lake, Feihu Mountain, Shangganling—"Heartbreak Ridge," and the Kim Sung counterattack. In more than three years of heroic fighting, they eliminated more than 1.09 million so-called "United Nations Forces" with inferior equipment. MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the "United Nations Forces" with superior equipment, was finally dismissed and stepped down. His successor, Commander Clark, had to lower his head and sign the armistice agreement with a mournful face. In his memoir "From the Danube to the Yalu River" in 1954, Clark frankly described himself: "... I executed the government's instructions and gained an unenviable reputation: the first American commander to sign an armistice without achieving victory. I felt a sense of frustration. I think my two predecessors, Generals MacArthur and Ridgway, felt the same way..."

    Today, Eisenhower, the agent of American arms dealers and a sinister executioner, is playing the role of Dulles ten years ago, running from the east side of the Pacific to the west side of the Pacific to conduct so-called "peace and goodwill" "visits." The documentary "The God of Plague Reveals Its True Form" uses concrete and abundant facts to expose the painted skin of Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, in front of the people of the world, and reveals its active aggressive original form. The Chinese people know how to "welcome" such a "God of Plague." The documentary "Ten Thousand Cannons Bomb the God of Plague" shows the heroic posture and strength of the officers and soldiers on the Fujian front of our country holding an armed demonstration against U.S. imperialist aggression, determined to liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace, firing cannons to "welcome" and "send off" the "God of Plague."

    The heroic artillerymen and heroic militiamen on the Fujian front wrote on the cannons and shells: "Eisenhower get out, fire!" They shouted: "We must liberate Taiwan, the territory of the motherland, fire!"

    This is the roar of the soldiers standing on the front line of anti-aggression against U.S. imperialism. It is also the support of our 650 million people for the Asian people's opposition to the U.S. imperialist aggression and war policy, and for the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip. It is also the expression of the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower. The angry cannons bombarded the "God of Plague" Eisenhower, who tucked his tail and rolled away from Taiwan.

    From the battle of Shangganling to the bombardment of the "God of Plague" on the Fujian front, it illustrates this truth: A jackal is still a jackal, and imperialism is still imperialism. U.S. imperialism will not change its policy of aggression and war against Asia because of its failures. Eisenhower, who has just been severely hit by the Asian storm, is not yelling to continue to use Japan to expand aggression? We Asian people must unite more closely, strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and give the aggressors a more powerful blow. The final victory will surely belong to us, and the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, will eventually be driven out of Asia and the Western Pacific!

    从上甘岭到福建前线
    ——看纪录片《戳穿美帝纸老虎》和《万炮齐发轰瘟神》
    文宗华
    《戳穿美帝纸老虎》是一部反映首都人民在“反美宣传周”里参观革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆的影片。在我国以及亚洲人民掀起反对美帝国主义侵略，反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的风暴中，我们重温一下朝鲜战争的全部历史是很有意义的。
    影片以大量的实物和图片叙述了中朝人民这段英勇的反帝斗争史实。十年前战争贩子杜勒斯亲自到三八线点燃了蓄谋已久的侵朝战火，武装到牙齿的美国强盗纠集了十四个仆从国家的军队，用最现代化的装备，企图以最短的时间，灭亡朝鲜，侵略我国，从而发动向整个社会主义阵营的进攻，真是张牙舞爪，不可一世。可是，雄赳赳、气昂昂的中朝人民军队，并肩举起了反侵略的正义的铁拳，在云山，长津湖，飞虎山，上甘岭——“伤心岭”，金城反击等战役中，狠狠地教训了美帝国主义这个侵略成性的强盗。在三年多的英勇战斗中，以劣势装备消灭了所谓“联合国军”一百零九万多人，麦克阿瑟这位优势装备的“联合国军”总司令终于被撤职下台，后任的总司令克拉克不得不低下头来哭丧着脸在停战协定上签字。克拉克1954年在他的回忆录《从多瑙河到鸭绿江》一书中作了坦率的自我描绘：“……我执行政府的指示，获得了一个不值得羡慕的名望：第一个在没有取得胜利的停战书上签字的美国司令官。我感到一种沮丧的心情，我想，我的两位前任，麦克阿瑟和李奇微将军也有同样的感觉……”。
    今天，美国军火商的经纪人、险恶的刽子手艾森豪威尔又扮演了十年前杜勒斯的角色，从太平洋的东边跑到太平洋的西边来，进行所谓“和平和亲善”的“访问”。《瘟神现原形》这部纪录片以确凿的丰富的事实，在世界人民面前，戳穿了艾森豪威尔这个美帝国主义头子的画皮，揭出了它的积极侵略原形。对于这么一个“瘟神”，中国人民是知道应当怎样来“欢迎”他的。纪录片《万炮齐发轰瘟神》就显示了我国福建前线官兵举行反对美帝侵略，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平的武装大示威，打炮“迎送”“瘟神”的雄姿和力量。
    福建前线英雄的炮手和英雄的民兵们，在炮身上、炮弹上写着：“艾森豪威尔滚蛋，开炮！”他们高呼：“我们一定要解放祖国的领土台湾，开炮！”
    这是站在反侵略最前线的战士对美帝国主义发出的吼声，也是我国六亿五千万人民为了支持亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略罪行和战争政策，为了支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，也是伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视的表示。愤怒的大炮轰得“瘟神”艾森豪威尔夹着尾巴滚离台湾。
    从上甘岭的战斗到福建前线炮轰“瘟神”，说明了这样一个真理：豺狼究竟是豺狼，帝国主义究竟是帝国主义，美帝国主义并不会因为它们的失败而改变它对亚洲的侵略和战争政策的。刚被亚洲风暴狠狠打击的艾森豪威尔，惊魂甫定不又在叫嚣要继续利用日本扩张侵略吗？我们亚洲人民只有更紧密的团结起来，加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，予侵略者以更有力的打击。最后胜利一定属于我们，世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义终将被赶出亚洲和西太平洋去！（附图片）
