Saving Pit Props, Improving Work Efficiency, Speeding up Tunneling, Reducing Labor Intensity
Coal Mine System Vigorously Promotes New Mining Methods

    (Our report) The nationwide promotion of twenty-two new technologies and experiences centered on reforming coal mining methods in coal mines has achieved remarkable results. To date, more than six hundred coal mining faces have basically eliminated the use of pit props as supports. Among them, more than one hundred working faces have implemented hydraulic mining, more than two hundred working faces have achieved "three no's," namely no workers, no supports, and no electric scraper conveyors, and more than three hundred working faces have adopted new types of substitute supports to replace pit props. In April and May alone, the average consumption of pit props per thousand tons of coal mined in the country's coal mines was more than 20% lower than last year, opening up broad prospects for the coal industry to ensure large-scale sustained high production in the context of difficult pit prop supply.
    The twenty-two new technologies and experiences being promoted in the coal mine system are mostly created by Chinese coal miners in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements this year. Among the important ones are the chamber-style hydraulic sand filling mining method for extra-thick coal seams created by Fushun, Fuxin and other coal mines, the long-hole deep-hole blasting mining method successfully tested by Beipiao and Kailuan coal mines, the thick coal seam gently inclined and inclined shield support mining method created by Huainan and Hegang coal mines, and various new mining methods created by Shandong and Sichuan and other coal mines. These mining methods can be applied to the geological conditions of most coal seams in our country and have universal promotion significance. Compared with the old mining methods, their common characteristics are not only high output, high efficiency, and rational resource recovery, but also can greatly save pit props and simplify processes, and can basically eliminate heavy physical labor in the mine. For example, the long-hole deep-hole blasting mining method, which has been promoted in many coal mines in Hebei, Liaoning and other provinces for steeply inclined coal seams, only requires workers to operate a small drilling machine to drill holes and blast in the lower roadway of the working face, and the coal can automatically fall into the roadway along the slope of the coal seam to be loaded into trucks, without having to enter the working face to engage in various heavy labor, and there are no electric scraper conveyors, supports and other equipment in the working face. The chamber-style hydraulic sand filling mining method, which has been adopted in various mines in Northeast China, can extract the entire extra-thick coal seam, which originally required ten or more extractions, in just a few times. According to statistics from Fushun Victory Mine, after adopting this new mining method, the average daily output of the entire mine increased by about 20% compared with the past, the efficiency of coal miners increased by about 30%, and the consumption of pit props decreased by about half compared with the past. At the same time, since no one is working in the working face, the working conditions of the workers have also been fundamentally changed.
    Among the twenty-two new technologies and experiences being promoted, there are also electric drills for tunneling rock roadways created by miners in Xinwen, Hegang and other coal mines, new types of substitute supports made of materials such as slag, cinder, and ceramsite, as well as slip-type coal bins, automated experience in coal washing systems, closed-circuit circulation of coal slime water, and four-in-one ring power supply, non-cutting processing, and widespread use of coal gasification promoted by the power and machinery departments. These new technologies and experiences, together with the one hundred and eighty advanced experiences summarized and required to be promoted by the Ministry of Coal Industry last year, will have a significant impact on changing the technological face of China's coal industry.
    In order to promote these new technologies and experiences quickly and effectively, the Ministry of Coal Industry has, since the beginning of this year, in addition to continuously holding many on-site meetings, organizing advanced experience dissemination teams, and widely exchanging and disseminating these advanced experiences, also established dissemination stations in the birthplace of some important experiences, and planned to organize various mines to visit the site. For some units that encountered special difficulties in the promotion process, it sent strong working groups to provide specific assistance. Recently, the ministry also adopted the method of comprehensively promoting key breakthroughs. For some new technologies and experiences that are not yet consolidated and perfected, it first helps some units to pass the technical hurdle, and then guides the overall promotion work after obtaining mature experience.

### 节约坑木　提高工效　加快掘进　减轻劳动强度  煤矿系统大力推广新采煤法

    节约坑木　提高工效　加快掘进　减轻劳动强度
    煤矿系统大力推广新采煤法
    本报讯　全国煤矿推广以改革采煤方法为中心的二十二项新技术和新经验获得显著成效。到目前为止，各地已有六百多个采煤工作面做到基本上不用坑木作支柱。其中有一百多个工作面推行了水力采煤，二百多个工作面实现了“三无”，即无人、无支柱、无电溜子，并有三百多工作面采用了新型的代用支柱代替坑木。仅4、5两个月内，全国煤矿平均每开采一千吨煤耗用的坑木，就比去年少用了20％以上，为煤炭工业在坑木供应困难的情况下保证大面积的持续高产，开辟了广阔道路。
    煤矿系统正在推广的二十二项新技术和新经验，绝大部分是我国煤矿工人今年以来在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造的。其中重要的有抚顺、阜新等煤矿创造的特厚煤层仓房式水砂充填采煤法，北票和开滦煤矿试验成功的长炮眼深孔爆破采煤法，淮南和鹤岗煤矿创造的厚煤层缓倾斜、倾斜掩护支架采煤法，以及山东和四川等地煤矿创造的各种新型采煤法等等。这些采煤方法能够适用于我国大部分煤层的地质条件，有着普遍推广的意义。与旧采煤方法比较，它们的共同特点不仅产量大、效率高、资源回收合理，而且可以大大节约坑木和简化工序，可以基本上消灭井下笨重的体力劳动。例如已在河北、辽宁等省许多煤矿的急倾斜煤层中推行的长炮眼深孔爆破采煤法，工人只要在工作面下部巷道内操纵着小型钻孔机钻孔放炮，煤就能沿着煤层的坡度自动落到巷道内装车，再也不必进入工作面去从事各种笨重的劳动，工作面内也没有电溜子、支柱等设备。已在东北各矿采用的仓房式水砂充填采煤方法，能够把原来需要分十数次开采的特厚煤层，只要几次就能全部采出。据抚顺胜利矿统计采用了这一新采煤方法后，全矿平均日产量比过去增加了20％左右，采煤工效率提高30％左右，坑木消耗比过去降低一半左右。同时由于工作面内无人工作，也从根本上改变了工人的劳动条件。
    在推行的二十二项新技术和新经验中，还有新汶、鹤岗等煤矿工人创造的掘进岩巷用的电钻，用炉渣、矿渣、陶粒等材料制造的新型代用支柱，以及滑坡式煤仓、洗煤系统的自动化经验、煤泥水闭路循环以及电力、机械等部门推广的四合一环行供电、无切削加工、广泛采用煤气化等等。这些新技术和新经验同煤炭工业部去年总结并要求推广的一百八十项先进经验一道，对改变我国煤炭工业的技术面貌将发生重大作用。
    为了迅速而有成效地推广这些新技术和新经验，煤炭工业部从今年年初以来除已连续召开许多现场会议，组织先进经验传播队，广泛交流和传播这些先进经验外，又在某些重要经验的发源地设立了传播站，有计划地组织各矿到现场去参观访问。对一些在推广过程中遇到特殊困难的单位，派出了强有力的工作组前往具体帮助。最近，这个部还采用全面推广重点突破的办法，对一些还不够巩固、完善的新技术和新经验，首先帮助某些单位过好技术关，在取得成熟经验之后，再来指导全面的推广工作。（附图片）
