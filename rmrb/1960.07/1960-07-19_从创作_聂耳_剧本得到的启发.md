　　Inspiration from Creating the "Nie Er" Script
　　Yu Ling
    The film "Nie Er" has officially been released. Thinking back to the creation of this screenplay, first of all, I should thank the Party, and thank the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Party Committee of the Shanghai Film Bureau for their leadership. Under the direct leadership and meticulous care of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, Comrades Meng Bo, Zheng Junli and I were able to complete the creative task of presenting the "Nie Er" script as a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country as scheduled.

    The script was completed through continuous revisions. During several revisions, we received repeated instructions and suggestions from responsible comrades of the propaganda, cultural, music, drama, and film departments, which enabled the quality of "Nie Er" to gradually improve.

    This was a collective creation. Almost every working comrade in the "Nie Er" crew of the Shanghai Haiyan Film Studio offered opinions and ideas during the creation and filming process, enabling the work to more accurately express the theme. This is the result of the Party leading literary and artistic creation along the mass line. Since the publication of the script, we have received valuable feedback from many readers. It is the happiest thing for creators to be able to revise their work based on so many valuable opinions; this always makes me feel very excited whenever I think of it.

    Although Comrade Nie Er's life was only twenty-four years long, his glorious and combative life cannot be fully encompassed by a single film.

    In terms of Nie Er's scope of activities, the script only wrote about his time in Shanghai, and only showed him going to the Yangtze River and the Great Wall. His hometown was only depicted in a few short flashback scenes. In terms of time, we only selected the five years after he arrived in Shanghai in the second half of 1930. In terms of the people and events he encountered, only Comrade Zhang Shu and one or two other real people appeared by name, and the rest were only generalized and fictionalized. Researchers familiar with Nie Er himself and Nie Er's materials also certainly understand that there are many stories of Nie Er that we did not use in the script.

    Writing biographical films about modern figures has its conveniences. The convenience lies in the fact that the time is close to us, memories are still fresh, there is a lot of information, and there are many places to visit, investigate, and research. However, perhaps its greatest difficulty lies in how to deal with real people and real events. In the film "Nie Er," we mostly wrote in broad strokes from the side. In some places where we could describe things truthfully, we selectively tried to remain faithful to the original facts. In places where we should create and fictionalize, we boldly created and fictionalized based on certain evidence. Therefore, the only and highest purpose of adopting this writing principle was to attempt to write about how Comrade Nie Er, under the education of the Party, was tempered into a political revolutionary and an artistic innovator, and how he raised the musical weapon to fight to the death against reactionary factions at home and abroad, while also focusing on summarizing the characteristics of the era, that is, reflecting the mass movements and struggles led by the Party on the cultural and artistic front in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time.

    Chairman Mao once incisively analyzed the characteristics of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period in "On New Democracy":
  "The third period is the new revolutionary period from 1927 to 1937. ... This period is a period of counter-revolutionary 'encirclement' on the one hand, and a period of revolutionary deepening on the other. At this time, there are two kinds of counter-revolutionary 'encirclement': military 'encirclement' and cultural 'encirclement'. There are also two kinds of revolutionary deepening: the deepening of the rural revolution and the deepening of the cultural revolution."

    Nie Er, in the five years of struggle under the leadership of the Party, from 1930 to 1935, was precisely the most brutal five years in those ten years. Nie Er, a young Communist Party member, with his spirit of rushing to do work and daring to take the lead, with his most courageous, firm, loyal, and enthusiastic revolutionary spirit, received the help of the Party's organizational strength and comrades in the arduous environment, flexibly mastered the principle of combining secret work with public activities, deeply rooted himself among the broad masses, shared the breath and feelings of the working people, was influenced by the working people to change his own thoughts, feelings, and position, tempered his musical weapon from scratch, brought into play the combat role of mass songs and film interludes, sang mass songs and film interludes that expressed the voices of the people, and played a powerful role in calling and organizing broad mass movements. The magnificent, ever-increasing mass struggles, in turn, acted on Nie Er's song creation and the activities of revolutionary musicians at that time, making the Party's new music army's sharp edge undergo tremendous revolutions in thought and form.

    During the conception and creation process, we had been unable to find a good solution to the question of how Nie Er's life and struggle in the Kuomintang-controlled area of Shanghai were connected with the military struggle in the Central Soviet Area. Then, after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works on the analysis of this era, we were finally inspired and created the character of Zheng Leidian and her entry and exit from the Soviet area and participation in the Long March.

    The appearance of Zheng Leidian, a young intellectual woman from a petty-bourgeois background, participating in the revolution with a strong petty-bourgeois fervor, had several different endings given to her in our several drafts. Someone like her, in the sharp struggle of revolutionary reality, could heroically sacrifice, or be arrested; after being arrested, she could be staunch and unyielding, or she could be passive and even betray the revolution. If so, what is the need for such a character to appear in the "Nie Er" script? Of course, the greater possibility is that she will be changed and thoroughly transformed into a true proletarian fighter after long-term revolutionary tempering, struggle, and practice. This is also an unnecessary character. Finally, the current treatment was determined: after being forged in the revolutionary furnace, she entered and exited the Soviet area, and was like a different person, not only playing a role in shaping the character of Nie Er, but also, more importantly, her dramatic plot of entering and exiting the Soviet area combined the struggle situation in the Kuomintang-controlled area with the revolutionary base area, enabling the film "Nie Er" to better summarize the general situation and style of the era.

    Nie Er was a patriot and a proponent of resistance against Japan. At the same time, he was also a mature class fighter, a great class singer, and the founder of Chinese proletarian musical art. The reason for Comrade Nie Er's greatness lies in the fact that he was first and foremost a resolute and thorough revolutionary whose thinking had been transformed, who had established a Marxist-Leninist worldview, and who had firmly stood on the proletarian position, becoming the first creator to shape the image of workers in musical art. As the sailor and boiler worker Lao Jiang said in the play: "You are the first to write songs for us workers." Just imagine twenty-seven or eight years ago, that is, during the most vigorous period of Nie Er's musical and song creation, whether a young literary and artistic worker was willing to combine with the workers and peasants was a question, and whether he could go was another question. And our precious Comrade Nie Er, at that time, not only realized the combination with the workers and peasants, but also, in his diary, in his creative practice, in order to shape the image of workers, overcame various difficulties, went to the workers, observed the workers' lives, experienced and learned the workers' thoughts and feelings, and became the workers' confidant friends and comrades. Therefore, in his songs, in his thoughts and actions, the anti-Japanese patriotic struggle and the class struggle were combined very consistently.

    Here I want to say that the process of creating "Nie Er" and learning from Nie Er has also become a process for me to reflect on and criticize my own creative thinking and improve my understanding. In the works of some writers of our era who struggled and lived in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the relationship between anti-Japanese patriotism and class struggle was not resolved or not resolved well enough. Just from the class relations of the protagonists of many works depicting anti-Japanese patriotism, we can see part of the problem. How many of them have the proletariat as the protagonist? This is a question of literary and artistic thought, and more importantly, a question of transforming stance, viewpoint, and worldview. On the issue of the consistent relationship between the anti-Japanese patriotic struggle and the class struggle reflected in Nie Er's creative practice and ideological actions, and on the high achievements he achieved in his musical works, I have been deeply inspired and educated.

    Nie Er's road is precisely the road that revolutionary intellectuals should and must take. Our pioneer Nie Er is still a role model for us to learn from.

    Although this film has achieved considerable success under the direct leadership and meticulous care of the Party, it still has relatively obvious shortcomings in both ideology and artistry. The screenplay should be held responsible for this first. In the screenplay, the shaping of the images of several Party leaders, the depiction of characters such as the worker Lao Jiang and Zhu Da Jie, and their roles and treatment in the dramatic plot are all not deep enough and not substantial enough. This has affected, to a certain extent, the ideological depth and artistic achievements of the characters performed by the director and actors. As for the quiet side of Nie Er's character, the script is also not full and adequate in terms of performing his ideological depth, his bitter thinking, his bitter pursuit, and his exploration of truth. And the huge and universal influence and role after the spread of the "March of the Volunteers" is also not adequately rendered in the script. In particular, the script does not reflect the great scene of the "December 9th" student movement in Beiping, and does not reflect the widespread singing of Nie Er's songs by the millions of students in this movement, which is proof that our study of Chairman Mao's works is not enough.

### 从创作“聂耳”剧本得到的启发

　　从创作“聂耳”剧本得到的启发
　　于伶
    影片《聂耳》正式公映了。想起这个电影剧本的创作，首先，应该感谢党，感谢上海市委和上海市电影局党委的领导。是在市委宣传部的直接领导与无微不至的关怀下，孟波、郑君里两位同志和我才能如期地合作完成了《聂耳》剧本为建国十周年献礼这一创作任务。
    剧本是在不断的修改中完成的。几次修改的过程中，都得到宣传、文化与音乐、戏剧、电影各部门负责同志的一再指示与提意见，从而使《聂耳》作品的质量能够逐步提高。
    这是一次集体创作，上海海燕电影制片厂《聂耳》摄制组几乎是每一位工作同志，在创作与摄制过程中，都提过意见出过主意，使得作品能较准确地表达主题思想。这是党领导文艺创作走群众路线的结果。剧本发表以来，又得到了不少读者的宝贵意见。创作者能根据这么多宝贵的意见来修改自己的作品，是一件最幸福的事；这使我每一想起，心情总是十分激动的。
    聂耳同志的一生，虽然只有短短的二十四年，可是他战斗的光辉的一生，绝不是一部影片所能包括得了的。
    从聂耳的活动范围说，剧本里除了写他在上海外，只写他到过长江和长城，写他的家乡就只有几个短的回忆镜头。从时间说，我们只选择了他1930年下半年到了上海之后的五年。从他接触的人与事来说，有名有姓的只出场了张曙同志等一两个真人，其余都只是经过概括与虚拟的了。熟悉聂耳其人与聂耳资料的研究家也当然了解：还有许多聂耳的故事，我们不曾用进剧本里去。
    写现代人物的传记影片是有它的方便之处的。方便在于：时间距离我们近，记忆犹新，资料多，可以访问、调查、研究的地方多。可是它的最大的困难之一，也许该说是，如何处理真人真事的问题了。在《聂耳》影片里，我们只是粗线条地侧面地写的多，有些可以如实描写的地方，我们就有选择地尽量忠实于原来的事实，应该创造与虚构的地方，我们就有所依据地大胆创造与虚构。所以要采取这个写作原则的唯一的也是最高的目的，只在于企图写出聂耳同志在党的教育下，如何锻炼成为一个政治上的革命家与艺术上的革新家，从热爱音乐艺术到高举音乐武器跟国内外反动派作生死斗争的精神，同时着重概括时代的特点，也就是反映出当时党在国民党统治区文化艺术战线上领导的群众运动和斗争。
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》中曾经精辟地分析过第二次国内革命时期的时代特点：
  “第三个时期是一九二七年至一九三七年的新的革命时期。……这一时期，是一方面反革命的‘围剿’，又一方面革命深入的时期。这时有两种反革命的‘围剿’：军事‘围剿’和文化‘围剿’。也有两种革命深入：农村革命深入和文化革命深入。”
    聂耳，在党的领导下斗争的五年，1930年至1935年，正是这十年中间的最残酷的五年。青年共产党员的聂耳，以他抢工作做、勇于打头阵的精神，以他最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的革命精神，在艰苦的环境中，得到了党的组织力量与同志们的帮助，灵活掌握了秘密工作和公开活动相结合的斗争原则，深深地生根在广大的群众中间，与劳动人民同呼吸共感受，受到劳动人民的影响来改变自己的思想感情与立场，从无到有地锻炼他的音乐武器，发挥了群众歌曲与电影插曲的战斗作用，唱出了人民大众呼声的群众歌曲、电影插曲，对广泛的群众运动，起了有力的号召和组织作用，波澜壮阔、一浪高一浪的群众斗争，又反过来作用于聂耳的歌曲创作和当时革命音乐工作者的活动，使得党的音乐新军的锋芒所向，从思想到形式起了极大的革命。
    在构思与创作过程中，我们对聂耳在国民党统治区上海的生活和斗争，怎样同中央苏区的军事斗争联系起来的问题，一直得不到很好的解决。于是再三地学习毛主席的著作对于这个时代的分析，终于得到启发，创造了郑雷电这个人物和她进出苏区和参加长征这个情节。
    郑雷电这样一个小资产阶级出身，带着浓重的小资产阶级的狂热来参加革命的知识青年女性的出现，在我们的几次稿本中间曾经给以几种不同的下场。像她这样的人，在革命现实的尖锐斗争中，可能英勇地牺牲，可能被捕；被捕之后可能坚强不屈，又有可能消极甚而至于叛变革命。这样的话，《聂耳》剧本里有什么必要出现这样的人物呢？当然，更大的可能是她经过长期的革命锻炼、斗争、实践，得到改变，彻底改造成为真正的无产阶级的战士。这也同样是不必要的人物。最后才确定了现在这样的处理：她经过革命洪炉的铸炼，进出苏区，判若两人，不仅在塑造聂耳这个人物身上起了作用，而更大的作用是她的进出苏区的戏剧情节，把国民党统治区和革命根据地的斗争情况结合了起来，使得影片《聂耳》得以较能概括时代的概况与风貌。
    聂耳是一个爱国主义者、抗战派，同时他更是一位成熟的阶级战士、伟大的阶级歌手、中国无产阶级的音乐艺术的奠基人。聂耳同志之所以伟大，正在于他首先是一个思想得到改造、建立了马克思列宁主义的世界观、站稳了无产阶级立场的坚决彻底的革命者，成为在音乐艺术里塑造了工人形象的首创者。正如剧中海员、锅炉工人老江说的：“替咱们工人写歌子的，你是第一个。”试想在二十七八年之前，也就是聂耳开始音乐创作与歌曲创作最旺盛的时期，一个青年文艺工作者肯不肯去和工农群众结合是一个问题，能不能去又是一个问题。而我们可宝贵的聂耳同志，当时就不仅意识到和工农的结合，而是在他的日记里，在他的创作实践中，为了塑造工人形象，突破种种困难，到工人中去，观察了工人的生活、体验与学习工人思想情感，做了工人知心的朋友与同志。因此，在他的歌曲里，在他的思想和行动中，抗日爱国斗争与阶级斗争是结合得非常一致的。
    这儿我想说，创作《聂耳》、学习聂耳的过程，也成为我反省与批判自己的创作思想和提高认识的过程。在我们同时代的斗争与生活在国民党统治区的若干作家的作品里，抗日爱国与阶级斗争的关系是没有解决或者解决得不够好的。单从许多描写抗日爱国作品的主人公的阶级关系上来看，也就能看到一部分问题所在了。有多少是以无产阶级为主人公的呢？这是一个文艺思想问题，更重要的是立场观点和世界观的改造问题。聂耳的创作实践和思想行动所反映出来的抗日爱国斗争与阶级斗争结合一致的关系问题上，在他的音乐作品所达到的高度成就上，我深深地得到了启发，受到了教育。
    聂耳的道路，正是革命的知识分子应该走和必须走的道路。我们的先行者聂耳至今仍是我们学习的榜样。
    这部影片虽然在党的直接领导与无微不至的关怀下，取得了相当的成就。但它不论在思想性与艺术性方面，都还存在着较为明显的缺点。这首先应该由电影剧本负责。电影剧本中，几位党的领导者的形象塑造，工人老江和朱大姊等人物的刻划，他们在戏剧情节中的作用与处理上，都是不深刻、不够分量的。这在一定程度上影响了导演与演员同志所表演人物的思想深度与艺术成就，至于聂耳这一人物的静的一面，表演他的思想深度，苦苦思索，苦苦追求，探索真理这些地方，剧本中也不够充分与饱满。而《义勇军进行曲》传布开之后的巨大和普遍的影响与作用，剧本中的应有的渲染也不充分。特别是剧本中间竟没有反映出“一二·九”北平学生运动这一伟大场面，没有反映这一运动中的千万学生群众广泛地唱聂耳歌曲，这是我们学习毛主席著作不够的证明。
