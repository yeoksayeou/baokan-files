Zalaite Banner Basically Achieves Semi-Mechanized Summer Hoeing
Labor Efficiency Rapidly Increases, Cultivation Speed Accelerates

(Our dispatch) The people of all nationalities in Zalaite Banner, Inner Mongolia, greatly reformed and created tools for summer hoeing and land reclamation, working diligently and cleverly for a month. This has basically achieved the semi-mechanization of shoveling and tilling agricultural implements. The summer hoeing in the banner was nearly a month earlier than in previous years. By June 20, the field crops had been shoveled twice, and by June 28, more than 70% had been shoveled three times. 300,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, exceeding the league's assigned task by 80,000 mu, and planting has been done immediately after reclamation.

The early start, rapid action, and high quality of this year's summer hoeing in the banner are mainly due to the unleashing of the masses and the comprehensive reform of summer hoeing tools in advance. The summer hoeing tool reform movement in the banner started before the general commencement of summer hoeing. Bao Wenzhong, the First Secretary of the Banner Party Committee, first went deep into the Erlongshan Commune in mid-April to pilot the reform of summer hoeing tools, and worked with the masses to develop a three-ridge weeding machine. The Party Committee of the Banner and the Commune took the lead, with committee members responsible for different areas, and adopted a method of combining cadres, skilled craftsmen, and experienced farmers. They first made a model, demonstrated it on the spot, conducted on-site consultations, and repaired it on the spot. As soon as a piece was modified, a site meeting was held to promote it on a large scale on the spot. In the process of modifying, promoting, and improving tools, Party committees at all levels firmly grasped political and ideological work, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses to reform summer hoeing tools. The masses automatically offered broken farm tools, old wood, and even broken chopping boards to reform farm tools. Some new tools were equipped with springs, requiring a lot of steel wire, so the masses took the springs from pheasant traps to use, without asking the state for an inch of steel wire.

Due to the high enthusiasm of the masses, the reform quickly developed from the reform of single weeding tools to the comprehensive reform of field management tools. Not only did each commune create multi-ridge weeding machines, but they also created thinning machines, fertilizer spreading carts, winnowing machines, powder spraying machines, and three-ridge and five-ridge shoveling, tilling, and fertilizer application three-in-one tools, making the entire field management tools a complete set. These tools all have the advantages of simple manufacturing, convenient operation, and high efficiency, with an average increase in work efficiency of more than two times, and some increasing by dozens of times. For example, the five-ridge weeding machine, which is widely used throughout the banner, can weed more than 120 mu of land a day, increasing work efficiency by nearly 40 times.

    扎赉特旗夏锄基本实现半机械化
    劳动效率迅速提高中耕速度加快
    本报讯　内蒙古扎赉特旗各族人民大改大造夏锄开荒等工具，苦干巧干一个月，使铲趟农具基本实现了半机械化，全旗夏锄比往年提前将近一个月，到6月20日大田作物已铲完二遍，到28日70％以上已铲完三遍。开荒三十万亩，超过盟下达任务八万亩，并作到随开随种。
    全旗今年的夏锄动手早、行动快、质量好，主要是由于放手发动了群众，提前一步全面改革了夏锄等工具。全旗的夏锄工具改革运动，是在夏锄普遍开始前搞起来的。旗委第一书记包文忠，首先于4月中旬深入二龙山公社，作了夏锄工具改革试点，并和群众共同研究制成三垅锄草机。旗委、公社党委书记挂帅，委员分片包干，干部、能工巧匠和老农三结合的办法，先作出样子，就地表演，就地会诊，就地修理。改成一件，马上召开现场会，就地大量推广。在改制推广改良工具当中，各级党委狠抓了政治思想工作，大大激发了群众改革夏锄工具的积极性。群众把破农具、旧木料甚至破菜板自动献出来改革农具。有些新工具上装弹簧，需要很多钢丝，群众就把打野鸡夹子上的弹簧拿下来用，没有向国家要一寸钢丝。
    由于群众的积极性高，很快从单项锄草工具的改革发展到田间管理工具的全面改革。各公社不仅创制出多垅锄草机，而且创制出间苗机、追肥车、扇车喷粉机和三垅、五垅铲趟追肥三用工具，使整个田间管理工具配套成龙。这些工具都具有制造简单、操作方便、效率高的优点，平均工效提高二倍以上，有的提高几十倍。如在全旗普遍使用的五垅锄草机，一天铲地一百二十多亩，提高工效近四十倍。
