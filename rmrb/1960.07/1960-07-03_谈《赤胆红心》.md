    On "A Heart of Red Loyalty"
    Tian Han
    Hunan is one of the birthplaces of revolution in modern Chinese history. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Hunan waged countless heroic and tenacious struggles against the heinous reactionary rulers. The blood shed by the martyrs dyed the red flag incomparably bright, nurtured the revolutionary ranks to be strong and powerful, and finally drove out the internal and external enemies who rode on the heads of the people. If these epic battles could be vividly and powerfully transformed into stage images, their educational significance for the people today would be enormous. The Hunan Provincial Drama Troupe's performance of "A Heart of Red Loyalty" has made valuable efforts in this regard.
    The story depicts the heroic self-defense struggle of revolutionary peasants in Hunan after the "Ma-Ri Incident" under the oppression of reactionary warlords and landlord armed forces. Reactionary officer Yang Shao-kui led his local militia to attack the revolutionary peasants, massacring Red Sister’s mother and others. Duan Hu, a member of the Peasants' Association, escaped from prison and, under the leadership of the Party, gathered some poor peasants who resisted tyranny and sought liberation to organize a peasant self-defense army, resolutely resisting the enemy with the weapons they had.
    However, the revolutionary ranks were not pure at the beginning. Among the Party leaders were Chen Duxiu elements like Liu Tianyou, and Yang Si, who had countless ties with the landlords. Taking advantage of Yang Shao-kui's wedding, they won the first round, but because of Yang Si's betrayal, Yang Shao-kui was let go, and because of Liu Tianyou's sabotage, they lost the opportunity to expand their ranks and advance into Liling County, and had to withdraw their troops back to Leopard Ridge to await orders. On the ridgehead position, Liu Tianyou insisted on disarming the landlord's armed forces, and the red flag was almost pulled out by him. Fortunately, Party Representative Zhao Hong returned. He announced that the organization had approved their formal establishment of the Self-Defense Force, and approved Duan Hu, Red Sister, and others to become glorious Communist Party members, calling on them to break through quickly to develop their ranks, while he himself would provide cover. As a result, Duan Hu and others successfully broke through, while Red Sister sacrificed her life, and Zhao Hong was captured after a fierce battle. Yang Shao-kui wanted to kill Zhao Hong to pay homage to his father, but because his superiors wanted him to induce Zhao Hong to surrender in order to disintegrate the peasant army, Yang entrusted this matter to Liu Tianyou, who had surrendered to the enemy. Liu failed to persuade him, and Yang Shao-kui shot the traitor dead. Just as he was about to massacre Zhao Hong, Duan Hu arrived in time, the Party representative was rescued, and Yang Shao-kui was brought to justice.
    The play boldly depicts the struggle between two lines within the revolutionary camp, profoundly exposes the harmfulness of Chen Duxiu's capitulationist line, and also creates several moving artistic images. Today, the people are happy to see the magnificent revolutionary struggle life of the past. The performers of this play all have full political emotion, and there are some thrilling and moving scenes. The plot is coherent and dramatic, and the stage effect is quite good. I would also like to offer some suggestions for this play.
    I think it is inappropriate to suddenly insert a discussion about the prospects of socialism and communism by the self-defense army members when Zhao Hong and others are covering the retreat of the main force in the fourth act. On the one hand, it is completely uncoordinated with the tense struggle, and on the other hand, it seems that the encirclement is due to this discussion. This creates unnecessary misunderstandings for the audience.
    In dealing with dramatic conflicts, the use of three disguised attacks on the enemy is quite dramatic, but it also seems repetitive. The depiction of the methods of struggle seems to be able to be more diverse, because the methods of struggle of the self-defense army in real life are quite rich and moving, and the pursuit of drama must also be based on reality. For example, the scene where Duan Hu disguises himself as a fake brigade commander in the second time is not entirely convincing. And in the plot where the peasant self-defense army intercepts the bridal sedan and disguises itself as a wedding procession to enter Yang Shao-kui's house, is it possible to do something more, but now it makes people feel that the bride is missing.
    The revolutionary hero masses led by Zhao Hong are basically well portrayed. They are truly loyal and courageous, earth-shattering. If their spiritual world is portrayed more fully, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is better combined with scientific reality, then they will be more vibrant and play a greater educational role.
    The Hunan Provincial Drama Troupe's performance in Beijing this time has achieved good results in acting, directing, and stage art. I wish them continued success and strive for higher ideological and artistic achievements.

    谈《赤胆红心》
    田汉
    湖南是中国近代史上革命策源地之一。湖南人民在党的领导下，对穷凶极恶的反动统治者做过无数英勇坚韧的斗争，烈士们流的血把红旗染得无比鲜艳，把革命队伍哺育得坚强壮大，终于驱除了骑在人民头上的内外敌人。这些战斗史诗倘使能生动有力地化成舞台形象，对今天人民的教育意义将是十分巨大的。湖南省话剧团演出的《赤胆红心》在这方面作了可贵的努力。
    故事是写“马日事变”后湖南革命农民在反动军阀和地主武装压迫下英勇的自卫斗争。反动军官杨少奎带领团丁向革命农民进攻，屠杀了红姑的母亲等人。农会会员段虎从狱中逃出，在党的领导下，集合了一些反抗暴政自求解放的贫农组织农民自卫军，凭借着他们所能有的武器坚决反抗敌人。
    但革命的队伍在开始时还是不纯的，党的领导人中就有刘天佑那样的陈独秀分子，又有跟地主有千丝万缕关系的杨四。利用杨少奎娶老婆的机会，他们打胜了第一回合，却因杨四的叛变放走了杨少奎，又因刘天佑的破坏，使他们失去扩大队伍进军醴陵县城的良机，不得不把队伍撤回豹子岭待命。在岭头阵地，由于刘天佑坚持向地主武装缴械；红旗几乎被他拔掉了。幸而党代表赵宏回来了。他宣布组织上已批准他们正式成立自卫队，和批准段虎、红姑等成为光荣的共产党员，号召他们赶紧突围去发展队伍，他自己担任打掩护。结果段虎等突围成功了，而红姑牺牲了，赵宏也力战后被俘。杨少奎要杀赵宏祭他父亲，却因他上级让他诱降赵宏来瓦解农民军，杨匪就把这事交给投敌的刘天佑。刘劝降不成，杨少奎把这叛徒枪毙了。当他正要屠杀赵宏的时候，幸而段虎及时赶来了，党代表被救，杨少奎伏法。
    剧本大胆地描写了革命阵营内部两条路线的斗争，比较深刻地揭露了陈独秀投降主义路线的危害性，也创造了几个动人的艺术形象。今天人民是欢喜看过去的壮烈的革命斗争生活的，这个戏的演出者都具有饱满的政治感情，又有一些惊险动人的场面，情节贯串，也富有戏剧性，舞台效果是相当好的。对这个戏我还想提出点意见。
    我觉得第四幕在处理赵宏等掩护大队撤退时，突然插入了一段自卫军队员们对社会主义、共产主义远景的议论，是不妥当的。一方面是和紧张的斗争完全不协调，一方面是这样一来，仿佛被包围也是由于这番议论使然的。给观众造成了不必要的误解。
    在戏剧冲突的处理上，利用三次化装袭击敌人，戏剧性是较强的，但是，也就显得重复。斗争方式的描写，似乎还可以更多样一些，因为实际生活中自卫军的斗争方式，就是相当丰富动人的，而且追求戏剧性，也必须建立在现实性的基础上，像第二次，段虎化装伪旅长的一场戏，就不能完全令人信服。而在农民自卫军拦花轿、扮作送亲打进杨少奎家里这个情节上，是不是也还可以做点文章，现在却使人感到新娘子没有下落了。
    以赵宏为首的革命英雄群众基本上是塑造得很好的。他们真是赤胆红心，惊天动地。如果把他（她）们的精神世界刻划得更饱满些，把他们的革命热情跟科学性现实性结合得更好些，那就会更加生气勃勃，起更大的教育作用了。
    湖南省话剧团此次在京演出，在表、导演和舞台艺术上都有很好的成绩，祝他们再接再厉，争取更高的思想艺术成就。
