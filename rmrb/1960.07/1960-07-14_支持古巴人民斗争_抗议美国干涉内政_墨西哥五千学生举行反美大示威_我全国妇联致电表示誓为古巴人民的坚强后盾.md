Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: Mexico City dispatch: Five thousand university students in the Mexican capital shouted the slogan "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" on the 12th, and held an anti-American demonstration. The demonstrators protested against the U.S. authorities for obstructing Mexico's support for Cuba and for brazenly interfering in Mexico's internal affairs.
    This demonstration took place after the U.S. State Department demanded that the Mexican Ambassador to the United States provide an "explanation" for the remarks made by the leader of the Mexican Congress in support of Cuba.
    At the beginning of the march, three thousand students set out from the Revolution Monument with anti-American placards and demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Embassy kept its doors tightly closed on this day. Soon after, another two thousand students joined the procession. They shouted anti-American slogans. The masses gathered on the streets also loudly condemned the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Robert Hill. The placards of the marching crowd also opposed the establishment of a military satellite observation station by the United States on Mexican territory. The demonstrators prepared to burn an American flag, but were forcibly taken away by the police. When the procession passed by a hotel where wealthy Americans gathered, angry demonstrators broke some windows.
    An Associated Press reporter from Mexico admitted that the U.S. government's blatant interference had aroused great public indignation in Mexico. It said: "The U.S. request for the Mexican government to clarify a ruling party congressman's remarks about supporting Cuba seems to be creating the first severe anti-American movement since Mexico confiscated foreign oil companies in 1938."
    Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram on the 12th to the Cuban Revolutionary Women's Alliance and the Cuban Women's Congress for the Liberation of Latin America, expressing high combat salutations to the Cuban people and women who are fighting heroically against U.S. imperialist interference and the threat of aggression, and for the defense of national independence and sovereignty, and firmly supports their just struggle to defend their motherland.
    The All-China Women's Federation's telegram said that U.S. imperialism is trying to put the Cuban people to death by economic pressure, which can be said to be extremely shameless. But its calculation is wrong. The unparalleled heroism of the Cuban people, united as one from top to bottom, fighting to defend the fruits of the revolution, and their confidence in final victory, cannot be subdued by any pressure or threat. The massive anti-American patriotic demonstration of 500,000 Cuban people in Havana once again warned U.S. imperialism, and fully demonstrated that the Cuban people and women who are determined to defend their motherland are not to be bullied. They will surely smash all the conspiracies and provocations of U.S. imperialism and win the final victory of the Cuban revolution.
    The telegram said: "Today's era is the era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. The era in which imperialism can do whatever it wants is gone forever. If U.S. imperialism dares to carry out a mad military adventure against the Cuban people, then it will inevitably suffer even more tragic defeats and will burn itself. The Chinese people and women, as well as the peace-loving and justice-upholding people and women of the world, are the strong backing of the Cuban people and women. Let us unite and persist in the struggle to the end to overthrow our common enemy—U.S. imperialism." (Attached picture)

　　支持古巴人民斗争　抗议美国干涉内政
　　墨西哥五千学生举行反美大示威
　　我全国妇联致电表示誓为古巴人民的坚强后盾
    新华社13日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥首都五千名大学生12日高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”的口号，举行了反美示威游行。示威者抗议美国当局阻挠墨西哥支持古巴，横暴地干涉墨西哥内政。
    这次示威游行是在美国国务院要求墨西哥驻美大使对墨西哥议会领袖支持古巴的谈话作出“解释”以后发生的。
    游行开始时有三千名学生高举着反美的标语牌从革命纪念碑出发到美国大使馆前举行示威。美国大使馆在这一天紧闭着大门。不久以后，又有二千名学生加入了游行队伍。他们高呼着反美的口号。聚集在街道旁的群众也高声谴责美国驻墨西哥大使罗伯特·希尔。游行队伍的标语牌中还反对美国在墨西哥领土上建立军事卫星观测站。示威者准备焚烧一面美国国旗，但是被警察强行夺去。当游行队伍经过美国阔老们聚集的旅馆时，愤怒的示威者打破了一些窗户。
    美联社记者从墨西哥发出的电讯承认，美国政府粗暴的干涉行为已经引起墨西哥公众的极大愤慨。它说：“美国要求墨西哥政府澄清一位执政党议员关于支持古巴的谈话这件事，似乎正在造成从1938年墨西哥没收外国石油公司以来第一次剧烈的反美运动。”
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会12日致电古巴革命妇女联盟和古巴妇女争取拉丁美洲解放大会，向为反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略威胁，为维护民族独立和主权而英勇斗争的古巴人民和妇女致崇高的战斗敬礼，并且坚决支持她们保卫祖国的正义斗争。
    全国妇联的电报说，美帝国主义妄图用经济压力置古巴人民于死地，这可以说无耻到了极点。但是它的算盘打错了，古巴人民举国上下、团结一致、为保卫革命胜利果实而斗争的无比的英雄气概，和对于最后胜利的信心，不是任何压力和威胁所能屈服的。哈瓦那五十万古巴人民声势浩大的反美爱国大示威，又一次地警告了美帝国主义，也充分说明了誓死保卫祖国的古巴人民和妇女是不可欺侮的，他们必将粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋和挑衅，取得古巴革命的最后胜利。
    电报说：“今天的时代是东风压倒西风的时代，帝国主义为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了，如果美帝国主义竟胆敢对古巴人民进行疯狂的军事冒险，那末它就必将遭到更加惨重的失败，必将玩火自焚。中国人民和妇女以及世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民和妇女，都是古巴人民和妇女的坚强后盾，让我们团结起来为打倒我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义而坚持奋斗到底。”（附图片）
