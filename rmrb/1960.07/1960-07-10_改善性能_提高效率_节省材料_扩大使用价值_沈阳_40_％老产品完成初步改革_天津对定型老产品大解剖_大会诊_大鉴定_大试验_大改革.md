　　Improve Performance, Increase Efficiency, Save Materials, Expand Use Value
　　Shenyang Completes Preliminary Reform of 40% of Old Products
　　Tianjin Conducts Major Dissections, Consultations, Appraisals, Experiments, and Reforms on Standardized Old Products

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch:  The mechanical and electrical factories in Shenyang are vigorously engaged in product design revolution, and currently, 40% of the old products have been redesigned. After the reform, these products have advanced structures, superior performance, simplified processes, and are economical and practical. They not only save steel materials and reduce manufacturing man-hours, but also greatly improve the use value of the products.

    At the beginning of February this year, the workers of Shenyang Water Pump Factory and Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory first proposed the goal of "increasing production without increasing manpower, one person doing the work of two" and "increasing production without increasing materials, one ton (of material) doing the work of two tons (of material use)" by reforming product design. They carried out fundamental technical transformation of the old product structure. The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee summarized the experience of these two factories and believed that this was an important way to ensure the great leap forward in mechanical industry production, improve product performance and quality, and save raw materials. They immediately organized promotion, and quickly achieved significant results.

    Through vigorously carrying out product design revolution, raw materials were greatly saved, equipment and manufacturing man-hours were saved, and production was greatly increased. According to the analysis of more than 200 kinds of products that have been reformed and finalized, the weight after the reform is on average 30% lighter than before the reform, and the production man-hours are saved by an average of more than 20%. Since the beginning of this year, according to the statistics of some factories, nearly 5,000 tons of steel materials have been saved through reforming product design. Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, and Shenyang Fan Factory, etc., through reforming product design and other industrial "drought resistance" measures, are now confident of achieving the goal of "increasing production without increasing materials, one ton doing the work of two tons" or "two tons doing the work of three tons".

    Vigorously carrying out product design revolution effectively consolidated the achievements of the technical revolution and greatly improved product performance, creating many new high-precision and cutting-edge products for the country. For example, the large-scale assembled machine tool successfully created by Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory by developing the experience of "ants gnawing bones" combined machine tools and "building block machine tools" can not only be assembled into eight kinds of large machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, planers, and borers according to production needs, and has the characteristics of high generalization, standardization, and serialization, but also the number of its parts, production cycle, and product cost are reduced by two-thirds and one-half compared with ordinary machine tools of the same type.

    All enterprises pay great attention to ensuring product quality and performance. Every time a product is reformed, a sample is first trial-produced, repeatedly tested, and appraised by a three-way combination group. Only when all aspects of technology, performance, and safe production fully meet the quality standards, can it be finalized for production. Some products that have undergone major technical reforms are also taken to the user departments for a longer period of practical testing. Only when the new improvements are absolutely certain, can they be put into mass production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch: The workers of Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industry system are vigorously engaged in product design revolution, making the structure of many products simpler and more efficient. According to incomplete statistics from the Mechanical, Agricultural Machinery, and Electrical Industries Bureaus, so far, 141 types of products with 410 specifications have been redesigned, which can save more than 6,000 tons of raw materials such as steel and copper throughout the year.

    The CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee attaches great importance to the work of reforming product design. Under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the mechanical and electrical industry bureaus and their subordinate factories and enterprises in the city have successively established product revolution leading groups and professional technical groups since May. They mobilized the technical forces of scientific research and design departments, and, under the leadership of leading cadres, went deep into factories and enterprises with relatively weak technical forces to widely cultivate experimental fields. Various factories and enterprises also adopted methods such as the combination of user, research, and production departments outside the factory, and the combination of veteran workers, technicians, and leading cadres inside the factory, to fully mobilize the masses to conduct major dissections, consultations, appraisals, experiments, and free airing of views on the standardized old products. It was found that most mechanical, electrical, and appliance products needed to undergo a product revolution. The workers of Tianjin Hoisting and Transport Equipment Factory, through a comprehensive dissection and analysis of the main product produced by the factory—electric hoists—and absorbing the opinions of more than 40 user units, modified the design and reinforced individual parts of the three products with lifting capacities of 0.5 tons, 2 tons, and 5 tons, thereby increasing the lifting capacity by a factor of two, turning them into new products of 1 ton, 4 tons, and 10 tons.

    改善性能　提高效率　节省材料　扩大使用价值
    沈阳40％老产品完成初步改革
    天津对定型老产品大解剖　大会诊　大鉴定　大试验　大改革
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳市各机械、电器工厂大搞产品设计革命，目前已有40％的老产品改革了设计。这些产品经过改革后，结构先进，效能高超，工艺简化，经济适用，不仅节约了钢铁材料和减少了制造工时，而且大大提高了产品的使用价值。
    今年2月初，沈阳水泵厂和沈阳高压开关厂职工，首先提出了通过改革产品设计做到“增产不增人，一人顶两人”、“增产不增料，一吨（材料）顶两吨（材料用）”的奋斗目标。他们对老产品结构进行了根本的技术改造，中共沈阳市委总结了这两个厂的经验，认为这是保证机械工业生产大跃进、改善产品性能、质量和节约原材料的一个重要途径，立即组织推广，并且很快取得了重大的成果。
    通过大搞产品设计革命，首先大大节约了原材料，节约了设备和制造工时，促进了生产大幅度增长。根据对已经改革定型的二百多种产品的分析，改革后的重量平均比改革前减轻了30％，生产工时平均节省了20％以上。今年以来据部分厂统计，通过改革产品设计已经节约了钢铁材料近五千吨，沈阳水泵厂，沈阳高压开关厂和沈阳扇风机厂等单位，通过改革产品设计和其他工业“抗旱”措施，现在已有把握实现“增产不增料、一吨顶两吨”或“两吨顶三吨”的目标。
    大搞产品设计革命，有效地巩固了技术革命的成果，大大提高了产品效能，为国家创造了许多新型的高精尖产品。例如，沈阳第三机床厂发展了“蚂蚁啃骨头”组合机床与“积木式机床”的经验而创制成功的大型拼合机床，不仅可以根据生产需要拼成车、铣、刨、镗等八种大型机床，具有高度通用化、标准化、系列化等特点，而且其零部件数量、生产周期和产品成本也都比同类型普通机床减少了三分之二和二分之一。
    各企业都十分注意保证产品质量，注意产品性能，每改革一种产品，首先都经过样品试制，反复试验，三结合小组鉴定，直到在技术、效能和安全生产等各方面都完全达到质量标准时，才定型生产。有些在技术上作了重大改革的产品，还拿到使用部门作较长时间的实际考验，直到新的改进绝对有把握时才大批投入生产。
    据新华社天津电　天津市机械电机工业系统职工大搞产品设计革命，使许多产品的结构由繁变简、由低效率变高效率。据机械、农业机械、电机三个工业局不完全统计，到目前为止，已有一百四十一种四百一十个规格的产品改革了设计，全年可以节约钢材、铜等原材料六千多吨。
    中共天津市委十分重视改革产品设计工作。在市委领导下，全市各机械电机工业局以及所属工厂企业，5月份以来都先后成立了产品革命领导小组和专业技术小组，发动科学研究、设计部门的技术力量，在领导干部的带动下，深入技术力量比较薄弱的工厂企业广种试验田。各个工厂企业还采取厂外使用、研究、生产部门三结合，厂内老工人、技术人员、领导干部三结合等方法，充分发动群众对定型老产品大解剖、大会诊、大鉴定、大试验、大鸣大放，发现绝大部分机械、电机、电器产品需要进行产品革命。天津起重运输设备厂职工，通过对本厂生产的主要产品——电动葫芦的全面解剖分析，并且吸收了四十多个使用单位的意见，将起重能力为零点五吨、二吨、五吨的三个产品，修改设计、加固个别部件，就使起重能力分别提高了一倍，变成了一吨、四吨、十吨的新产品。
