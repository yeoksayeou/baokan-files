　　Shandong: Various regions are unifying the dispatch of vehicles from government organs and enterprises to participate in the battle.
　　Jiangxi: Great innovations in transportation, linking pit mouths and furnace sides on the front line.
　　Qinghai: Making use of simple resources, adapting to local conditions, and bringing forth indigenous and foreign equipment in an endless stream.
　　Guangxi: Ox carts and horse carts are all put into action, with a constant supply of steel "grain".

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 9th:　The staff and workers on the transportation front and at the iron mines in Shandong Province are working together to strengthen the transportation of iron ore, ensuring that blast furnaces have an ample supply of ore raw materials during the rainy season. At present, the average ore reserve of steel production units throughout the province is about thirteen days.

　　The Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation, the Department of Metallurgical Industry, and the Jinan Railway Bureau have jointly formed an Ore Transportation Office to strengthen transportation organization and management, rationally dispatch additional transportation equipment, and further leverage the transportation efficiency of railways, highways, and shipping. With the assistance of relevant departments, the mines have vigorously strengthened hoisting and in-mine transportation. For example, more than ten mines, such as the Xiangshan Iron Mine in Yantai, have recently laid more than 80 kilometers of narrow-gauge railways inside and outside the mines, and have officially opened to traffic.

　　All railway stations under the Jinan Railway Bureau have listed ore transportation as one of the key materials, with dedicated personnel responsible for dispatch. Station staff and local handling departments are cooperating to speed up loading and unloading, shorten the dwell time of trains at stations, and accelerate vehicle turnaround. In June, the stations overfulfilled the monthly ore transportation plan by 4.8%, transporting 22,000 tons more ore than in May.

　　Local transportation departments are carrying out "one-dragon" services in ore transportation. For ore transported from the Linyi area to Qingdao, a method of connecting transportation by truck-ship-truck is adopted, reducing loading and unloading links, basically achieving ore without touching the ground, and accelerating the speed of ore transportation.

　　Various regions have also organized vehicles from government organs and enterprises to participate in ore transportation. In the Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo areas, more than 630 vehicles from government organs and enterprises participate in ore transportation every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 9th:　Jiangxi Province is vigorously grasping ore transportation, carrying out technological innovation in mine transportation, and building earthen railways and simple highways, so that ore can flow smoothly from the iron mine pit mouth all the way to the iron-smelting furnace, ensuring that blast furnaces will not stop production even if ore is not transported for three days.

　　At present, through the technological innovation movement, large and medium-sized iron mines throughout the province have basically achieved aerial transportation using cableways, ground transportation using vehicles, inclined transportation using chutes, hoisting using levers, and loading and unloading using funnels. Moreover, in-mine transportation and external transportation lines are connected into a dragon, greatly improving the efficiency of ore transportation.

　　For external transportation, in addition to improving the original railway, highway, and waterway transportation capacity, various regions have also built small-scale indigenous and foreign railways and simple highways. Up to now, the province has built ten local railways for transporting ore, totaling 130 kilometers in length, of which three have been opened to traffic for ore transportation; hundreds of kilometers of simple highways and cart roads have also been built.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 9th:　The steel and metallurgical departments of Qinghai Province have vigorously grasped the transportation of ore and fuel. The ore transportation volume in June increased by more than double compared to May.

　　Since May, the steel front in Qinghai Province, in response to the weak links of mine transportation and highway transportation not keeping up with production needs, has adopted simple and adaptable methods in various major mining areas, and has successively built many simple ore transportation equipment such as narrow-gauge railways, aerial cableways, inclined hoists, and winding mountain roads, greatly improving transportation efficiency.

　　While solving mine transportation, highway transportation departments in various regions have also transferred a portion of professional operating vehicles from May and organized two metallurgical professional transportation teams, adopting the "four fixings" (fixed tasks, fixed routes, fixed times, fixed factories) method to rush-transport ore and fuel, greatly improving transportation efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 9th:　Under the slogan of "Stocking up grain and grass for steel production," the transportation departments of Guangxi launched the "High Transportation to Guarantee High Production" movement, which led to a rapid increase in the volume of iron ore transported. The iron ore transportation volume in June throughout the autonomous region increased by 9.5% compared to May.

　　Since May, railways, highways, and folk transportation throughout the autonomous region have vigorously promoted the communist spirit of cooperation, and have successively established cooperation organizations, unified planning, unified dispatch, and adopted methods such as fixed points, fixed lines, fixed tasks, and fixed transportation capacity, and established various types of transportation lines to connect the transportation of mines, stations, and steel plants, improving the transportation efficiency of iron ore.

    千车万船　水陆兼程　运矿石保钢铁
    山东　各地统一调度机关企业汽车参加战斗
  　江西　交通运输大闹革新坑口炉边一线相联
    青海　因陋就简因地制宜土洋设备层出不穷
  　广西　牛马大车一齐上阵钢铁粮草源源不断
    本报济南9日电　山东省交通运输战线和各铁矿山的职工，同心协力加强铁矿石运输，确保高炉在雨季有充足的矿石原料。目前，全省各钢铁生产单位平均已有十三天左右的矿石储备量。
    山东省交通厅、冶金厅、济南铁路局等部门，联合组成了矿石运输办公室，加强运输组织和管理工作，合理调度增添运输工具，进一步发挥铁路、公路和航运的运输效能。各矿山在有关部门协助下，大力加强了提升和矿内运输。如烟台祥山铁矿等十多处矿山，最近在矿内外铺设了八十多公里轻便铁路，并已正式通车。
    济南铁路局各火车站都把矿石运输列为重点物资之一，设专人负责调运，车站职工和地方搬运部门协作，大搞快装快卸，缩短列车在站停留时间，加速了车辆周转。6月份，各车站共超额4.8％完成了全月矿石调运计划，比5月份多运了二万二千吨矿石。
    地方交通运输部门在矿石运输中大搞一条龙。临沂地区运往青岛的矿石，采取汽车—轮船—汽车衔接运输的方法，减少了装卸环节，基本做到矿石不落地，加速了矿石的运输速度。
    各地还组织了机关、企业的汽车参加了矿石运输。济南、青岛、淄博三个地区，每天就有六百三十多辆机关、企业的汽车参加运输矿石。
    据新华社南昌9日电　江西省各地狠抓矿石运输，进行矿区运输技术革新，建设土铁路和简易公路，使矿石从铁矿坑口一直到炼铁炉边，畅通无阻，保证了高炉三天不运矿石不会停止生产。
    目前，全省大、中型铁矿山通过技术革新运动，基本上做到了空中运输用索道，平地运输用车子，斜坡运输用溜槽，提升用杠杆，装卸用漏斗，而且矿内运输和矿外交通线联接成龙，大大提高了矿石运输效率。
    对于矿外运输，各地除了提高原来铁路、公路和水路运输能力以外，还兴建小型土洋铁路和简易公路。到目前为止，全省为运输矿石而兴建的地方铁路有十条，共长一百三十公里，其中已有三条通车运矿；简易公路和大车道也修建了几百公里。
    据新华社西宁9日电　青海省钢铁冶金部门狠抓矿石、燃料运输，6月份矿石运量比5月份增加了一倍多。
    5月份以来，青海省钢铁战线针对当前矿区运输和公路运输跟不上生产需要的薄弱环节，在各个主要矿区，采取因陋就简、因地制宜的办法，先后建起了许多轻便铁轨、架空索道、斜坡卷扬、盘山道等简易运矿设备，使运输效率大大提高。
    在解决矿区运输的同时，各地公路运输部门也从5月份起抽调了一部分专业营运车，组织了两个冶金专业运输队，采取“四定”（定任务、定路线、定时间、定工厂）办法抢运矿石燃料，大大提高了运输效率。
    据新华社南宁9日电　广西交通运输部门在“为钢铁生产备足粮草”的口号下，开展“高运保高产”运动，使铁矿石的运量迅速上升。6月份全自治区的铁矿石运量比5月份增长9.5％。
    从5月份以来，全自治区的铁路、公路及民间运输，大兴共产主义协作之风，纷纷建立协作机构，统一计划，统一调度，采取定点、定线、定任务、定运力等办法，建立各种类型的运输线，把矿山、车站、钢铁厂的运输衔接起来，提高了铁矿石的运输效率。
