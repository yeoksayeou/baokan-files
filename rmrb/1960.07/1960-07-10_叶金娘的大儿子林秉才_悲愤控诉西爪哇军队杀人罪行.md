Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 9th. Lin Bingcai, the eldest son of overseas Chinese Ye Jinniang, who was murdered by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia, and a student at the Fujian Fu'an Agricultural College, bitterly accused the West Java military authorities of their bloody crimes at a gathering held at the school on the 8th.

　　Lin Bingcai accused: "Before my mother, Ye Jinniang, was killed by the West Java military authorities, she wrote to me saying that she had completed all the procedures to return to China, and that mother and son would soon be reunited in the motherland. At that time, I was extremely happy. Thinking that I would soon see my mother after nine years of separation, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. Who knew that just as I was filled with infinite joy, the unfortunate news came that the West Java military authorities had forever deprived us of the opportunity for mother and son to reunite."

　　Lin Bingcai said: "My mother was a kind woman. She had always been law-abiding and hardworking during her more than twenty years of living in Zhimahui, and she got along well with her Indonesian friends. However, under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, the West Java military authorities committed such a brutal act, killing my mother with bullets. I demand that the Indonesian government immediately severely punish the murderers, stop the forced relocation, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future."

    叶金娘的大儿子林秉才
    悲愤控诉西爪哇军队杀人罪行
    新华社福州9日电　被印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害的侨胞叶金娘的大儿子、福建省福安农业专科学校学生林秉才，8日在学校举行的集会上悲愤地控诉西爪哇军事当局犯下的血腥罪行。
    林秉才控诉说：“我的母亲叶金娘被西爪哇军事当局杀害前曾写信告诉我说：她已办好了一切回国手续，不久母子可以在祖国团聚了。当时，我高兴极了。想到快要见到阔别九年的母亲，兴奋得整夜睡不着觉。谁知道，正当我充满着无限喜悦的时刻，传来了不幸消息，西爪哇军事当局永远夺去了我们母子团聚的机会。”
    林秉才说：“我的母亲是一个善良的女人，她在芝马圩侨居二十多年中，从来都是安分守己、辛勤劳动的，同印度尼西亚的朋友们相处得很好。但是，在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动下，西爪哇军事当局干出这样残暴的事来，用枪弹杀死我的母亲，我要求印度尼西亚政府立即严惩凶手，停止迫迁，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。”
