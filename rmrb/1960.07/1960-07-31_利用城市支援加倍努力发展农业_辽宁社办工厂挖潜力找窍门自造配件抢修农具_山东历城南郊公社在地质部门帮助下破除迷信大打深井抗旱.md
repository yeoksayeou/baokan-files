    With Urban Support, Intensify Efforts to Develop Agriculture
    Liaoning Commune-Run Factories Tap Potential and Find Clever Ways to Self-Produce Parts and Repair Farm Tools
    Shandong Licheng Southern Suburb Commune, Aided by Geological Departments, Breaks Superstitions and Sinks Deep Wells to Fight Drought

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: With the support of urban industry, rural areas in Liaoning Province are self-producing parts and independently repairing various agricultural machines, making early preparations for the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting.

    The number of tractors, irrigation and drainage equipment, and other agricultural machinery supported by urban industry to rural areas in Liaoning Province has increased rapidly. However, after this year's spring plowing and sowing, many agricultural machines need to replace parts and undergo repairs. In order to complete the repair of these agricultural machines in a timely manner, the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Machinery Department, Chemical Industry Department, and other relevant units have formed parts work groups, arranging sixty factories to rush to produce various parts to support rural areas, powerfully supporting the repair of agricultural machinery.

    In addition to urban industries supporting some of the required parts, the employees of commune-run industries in various rural areas have adopted simple and self-reliant methods, tapping potential and finding clever ways to quickly repair various agricultural machines that have fallen into disrepair. Various rural areas have adopted methods such as repairing and reactivating old parts for reuse, clearing warehouses to tap potential, and mutually adjusting surpluses and deficits to solve the problem of insufficient parts. After adopting these methods, seven counties in the Jinzhou area solved the problem of four thousand three hundred and thirty-two parts of three hundred and twenty models of agricultural machinery at once. Employees of machine repair factories in Jinxi, Yi County, and Jin County and other counties used indigenous methods to self-produce precision parts. They used manual grinding without grinding machines; they used object tracing without blueprints; and adopted methods of repairing waste products and reactivating parts. In just half a month, they produced three hundred and three parts of eleven models, including pump bodies, fuel injectors, and pistons, to supply the needs of agricultural machinery repair. As of July 10, 27% of tractors in the Jinzhou area have been repaired, and 37% of irrigation and drainage equipment has been repaired.

    While strengthening the repair of agricultural machinery, tractor drivers in many rural people's communes have also actively launched activities to strengthen the maintenance and care of machines in order to reduce wear and tear and extend the service life of parts and accessories. Tractor drivers in Liaoyang and Haicheng launched a major competition to maintain and care for tractors. The machine耕队 (roughly "tilling team") of the Shaling Commune in Liaoyang had two tractors that, due to good equipment maintenance and care, created a record of plowing 1,200 hectares without repair, exceeding the prescribed standard by half.

    This newspaper reports that, with the vigorous support of all walks of life, the Party committee and the vast number of members of the Southern Suburb Commune of Licheng County, Shandong Province, have even greater determination to become rich by relying on their own efforts and working hard, and their measures to increase production are more effective.

    Most of the land in this commune is thin soil on hills and ridges, and water sources are extremely scarce. There have been severe droughts for years, and thirty-four of the thirty-seven villages have run out of water, causing many difficulties in production. Over the past few years, the province, city, and county have continuously provided the commune with manpower, materials, and financial support. Especially in the battle against drought and搶種 (roughly "rush planting") and preserving seedlings in the spring and summer of this year, thousands of cadres, students, and a large number of vehicles and machinery transported water from afar every day to help fight the drought. The Hydrology Team of the Provincial Geological Bureau also helped drill three machine wells in the areas with the most scarce water sources, breaking the mystery of "no water since ancient times" here, and inspiring commune members to vigorously tap water sources. Members of production brigades such as Xinglong and Baliwa dug open mountain rocks more than 20 meters deep and built 38 wells in one go, found 68 mountain springs, and dug 19 small reservoirs, watering and planting more than 22,000 mu of sweet potatoes.

    In order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of all commune members, the Southern Suburb Commune Party Committee recently conducted another education on "agriculture is the foundation" for Party members, cadres, and commune members, and everyone has a greater understanding of the great significance of doing a good job in agricultural production. At this time, the commune Party committee vigorously grasped collective welfare work, and the number of canteens has increased from 43 before the wheat harvest to 92, and the number of nurseries has increased from more than 10 to 40. Therefore, everyone is full of energy, and the labor force concentrated on field management in the whole commune has increased from the original 40% to about 70%. The labor efficiency of each production team has also been significantly improved. The amount of land weeded by each person per day in the Shilihe Brigade has increased from 0.8 mu to 1.2 mu, and the amount of sweet potato ridges扶(roughly "supported") per day has increased from 2.5 mu to 3.5 mu.

    Commune-run industries also provided 400,000 yuan in funds for agriculture to purchase agricultural machinery and fertilizers. The iron and wood factory manufactured more than 30,000 pieces of various small farm tools, more than 200 rubber-wheeled vehicles, and more than 1,000 pieces of machinery parts for agriculture.

    In previous years, some teams had the idea of ​​relying solely on commercial fertilizers. This year, the entire commune organized 13 year-round fertilizer accumulation professional teams, going to Jinan every day to dig human and animal waste fertilizer and composting green manure and native miscellaneous fertilizer. The amount of native miscellaneous fertilizer applied in the entire commune has doubled compared to last year. A high tide of autumn field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, topdressing fertilizer, weeding, and preventing drought has now formed.

    利用城市支援加倍努力发展农业
    辽宁社办工厂挖潜力找窍门自造配件抢修农具
    山东历城南郊公社在地质部门帮助下破除迷信大打深井抗旱
    据新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省各地农村在城市工业支援下，自造配件，自力更生检修各种农业机械，为秋收、秋耕、秋种提前做好准备。
    辽宁省各城市工业支援农村的拖拉机、排灌设备和其他农业机械迅速增长。但是，经过今年春耕、春播，许多农业机械都需要更换配件，进行检修。为了把这批农业机械及时检修完，辽宁省农业机械厅、化工厅等有关单位都组成配件工作小组，安排了六十个工厂赶制各种配件，支援农村，有力地支援了农业机械的检修工作。
    各地农村除城市工业支援一部分所需配件外，各社办工业的职工，采取因陋就简、自力更生的办法，挖潜力、找窍门，赶紧检修各种失修的农业机械。各地农村采取了旧配件检修复活后再用、清仓挖掘潜力、互相调剂有无等办法，解决配件不足问题。锦州地区七个县采取这些办法后，一下子解决了三百二十种型号农业机械的四千三百三十二件配件问题。锦西、义县、锦县等县机修厂职工，用土办法自造精密配件。他们没有磨床就用手工碾磨；没有图纸用实物描绘；以及采取修复废品、复活配件的办法，在短短半个月中，就生产出水泵体、喷油嘴、活塞等十一种型号共三百零三件配件，供应了农业机械检修的需要。锦州地区到7月10日止，拖拉机已修复27％，排灌设备已修复37％。
    与加强农业机械检修的同时，许多农村人民公社的拖拉机驾驶员，还积极开展了加强机器维护保养的活动，以减少损耗，延长零件、配件的使用寿命。辽阳、海城两地拖拉机驾驶员，开展了维护保养拖拉机的大竞赛。辽阳沙岭公社机耕队有两台拖拉机，由于设备维护保养做得好，创造了翻地一千二百公顷不检修的纪录，比规定的标准超过了一半。
    本报讯　在各行各业大力支援下，山东历城县南郊公社党委和广大社员，自力更生、奋发图强、由穷变富的决心更大，增产措施更有力。
    这个公社的土地大多是山岭薄地，水源极缺。去年今年连年大旱，三十七个村庄有三十四个断了水，生产上的困难很多。几年来，省、市、县不断给这个公社以人力物力财力的支援，特别在今年春夏抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗的战斗中，每天都有数千名干部、学生和大批车马机具远途送水，帮助抗旱。省地质局水文大队还帮助水源最缺的地方打出三眼机井，打破了这里“自古无水”的谜，鼓舞了社员挖掘水源的冲天干劲。兴隆、八里洼等生产大队的社员们凿开二十多米深的山石，一气打成三十八眼水井，找到六十八个山泉眼，挖好十九个小水库，浇水栽种甘薯二万二千多亩。
    南郊公社党委为了进一步调动全体社员的积极性，最近又对党员、干部和社员进行了一次“农业是基础”的教育，大家更认识到搞好农业生产的重大意义。就在这个时候，公社党委狠抓集体福利工作，食堂已由麦收前的四十三处增加到九十二处，托儿所由十多处增加到四十处。因此，人人干劲充足，全社集中到田间管理的劳力，由原来40％增加到70％左右。各生产队的劳动效率也有了显著提高，十六里河大队每人一天锄地由八分增至一点二亩，扶地瓜垅每天由二亩半增至三亩半。
    社办工业也为农业提供资金四十万元，购置农业机械、肥料。铁木工厂为农业制造各种小农具三万多件，胶轮车二百多辆，机具零件一千多件。
    往年部分队有单纯依靠商品肥的思想，今年全社组织起十三个常年积肥专业队，天天到济南市里挖大粪污肥，沤制绿肥、土杂肥。全社土杂肥施肥量比去年增加一倍。现在一个以积肥追肥锄草防旱为中心的秋田管理高潮已经形成。
