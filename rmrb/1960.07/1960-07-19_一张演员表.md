　　A Cast List

    We watched a performance of the drama "Relatives" at the Hubei Theater in Wuchang. This is a play in which commercial workers use their own creations to reflect their actual lives.

    Before the performance, we saw a brochure, and when we turned to the page with the cast and crew, it aroused great interest in us. The cast list indicates the current work positions of the actors, covering a wide range. The protagonist of this play, Zheng Yulan, is a family woman successfully shaped by the playwrights Jiang Hongqi and others, based on the advanced thinking of Long Rongfang, an advanced commercial worker in Wuhan. After she participated in commercial work, under the cultivation and education of the Party, she gradually developed into a diligent, hardworking, and resourceful advanced salesperson who serves the people wholeheartedly and treats customers as relatives. This protagonist, Zheng Yulan, is played alternately by a supplier from the Wuhan Pharmaceutical Company and an accountant from the Animal Products Company. Since the play was performed, a mass movement of "learning from Zheng Yulan, catching up with Zheng Yulan, and surpassing Zheng Yulan" has been launched among commercial workers in Wuhan. In addition, the actors who play purchasing agents, pharmacists, and deputy section chiefs of the industrial section include accountants, salespeople, repairmen, auditors, warehouse managers, and so on. All actors and staff are amateurs.

    Amateur artistic activities that write about themselves and perform themselves are important content for encouraging production and enriching cultural life. The drama "Relatives" has become one of the three red flowers on the theater scene beloved by the people of Hubei in the past two years, on par with the opera "Honghu Red Guards" and the Peking Opera "Seven Fairies of Tea Mountain." The playwrights and actors of "Relatives" are familiar with their own lives, have high political enthusiasm, and are energetic. Coupled with their hard work and humble learning, they have achieved such success. After watching the play "Relatives," we have a deeper understanding that the creative talent of the masses is the greatest and most abundant.

    我们在武昌湖北剧场看了一场话剧《亲人》。这是一出商业职工们用自己的创作来反映自己实际生活的戏。
    在开演前看到了一份说明书，我们翻到演职员表这一页，引起了我们很大的兴趣。演员表标明了演员同志们现在工作的岗位，包括的范围很广。这戏的主角，是剧作者江洪其等同志以武汉市先进商业工作者龙蓉芳同志的先进思想为基础，成功地塑造了郑玉岚这个家庭妇女的形象，她参加商业工作后，在党的培养教导下，逐步锻炼成一个勤勤恳恳、不辞劳苦、千方百计为人民服务、把顾客当亲人的先进营业员。这个主角郑玉岚是由武汉市医药公司供应员和畜产公司会计员来轮流扮演的。自从这个戏演出之后，武汉市商业工作者已掀起了一个“学郑玉岚、赶郑玉岚、超郑玉岚”的群众运动。此外，饰进货员、药剂士、工业课副课长等演员的有会计员、营业员、修理工、审计员、仓库管理员等等。全体演员、职员都是业余的。
    业余艺术活动写自己、表演自己，是鼓舞生产、丰富文化生活的重要内容。《亲人》这出话剧已成为近两年来湖北人民热爱的戏剧上的三朵红花之一，与歌剧《洪湖赤卫队》和京剧《茶山七仙女》齐名。《亲人》的剧作者和演员熟悉自己的生活，在政治上热情高，干劲大，再加上他们刻苦钻研，虚心学习所以才有这样的成就。看过了《亲人》这出戏，我们更深刻地体会到群众的创造才能是最巨大和最丰富的。
