　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 30th - Pyongyang newspapers published commentaries on the 29th, condemning the behavior of Western countries headed by US imperialism in sabotaging the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference.
　　The "Rodong Sinmun" commentary pointed out that the heinous act of Western imperialists in sabotaging the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference proves that US imperialism is frantically stepping up war preparations, exacerbating international tensions, and is the ferocious enemy of mankind. The Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely condemn the imperialists' crude actions that seriously provoke peace and security. The commentary said that all the facts prove that the responsibility for sabotaging the disarmament talks lies entirely with US imperialism and its followers. Since the beginning of the talks, Western imperialists have not put forward a single constructive proposal. After sabotaging the talks, they claimed to be "preparing new proposals," plotting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the talks onto the Soviet Union. The people of the world clearly know that this is the same robber logic as trying to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference onto the Soviet Union, which went bankrupt. The entire process of the disarmament talks shows that US imperialism and its followers do not actually want disarmament, but are attempting to deceive the people with empty talk about disarmament and frantically plot to gain time to prepare for a new war.
　　The commentary said that the act of the imperialist ruling clique in sabotaging the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee clearly proves that the imperialists, headed by US imperialism, continue to struggle and pursue a policy of "strength." This shows that all peace-loving forces must unite, be more vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism and its followers, and further strengthen the struggle for world peace and human security.
　　The "Minju Choson" commentary said that the consistent two-faced tactics of US imperialism, which sabotaged the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, have further isolated them in the eyes of the people of the world and sounded an alarm for those who hold unrealistic illusions about imperialism.
　　The commentary emphasized that the people of the world must expose and smash this robber-like challenge of US imperialism and raise the necessary vigilance. The people must not harbor any illusions about imperialism and must always remember that peace is not begged for, but must be won through tenacious struggle.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 30th - The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" published a commentary on June 29th, condemning the United States and other Western countries for sabotaging the meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.
　　The commentary said that after sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference, the Washington leadership group and its followers, regardless of the demands of world public opinion, continued to implement the notorious "position of strength" policy and formulated new plans to strengthen military aggression blocs and continue the arms race. Now, the US leadership group and its followers have again sabotaged the negotiations of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.
　　The commentary said that the delegations of the United States and other Western countries participating in the disarmament negotiations for three consecutive weeks only shouted empty slogans about their interest in disarmament, while failing to provide any specific answers to the new Soviet disarmament proposals and failing to put forward any affirmative plans. It is obvious that their purpose is to continue using the talks as a facade, using the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee as a mask to deceive public opinion and as a curtain to conceal their continued implementation of aggressive plans. They used the tactics of delay and endless debate at the meeting, while formulating dangerous plans outside the meeting.
　　The commentary then revealed that what is the use of saying empty words about being concerned about disarmament when the US Congress has passed the highest military budget in peacetime? What is the value of talking about being concerned about disarmament when a decision is made to have US and British aircraft armed with atomic weapons conduct patrol flights near the borders of socialist countries, and when someone spares no effort to get the dirty US-Japan military treaty "ratified" despite violating the vital interests of the Japanese people?
　　The commentary concluded by saying that the Albanian people express their deep hatred for the imperialist aggressive group headed by US imperialism that sabotaged the Geneva talks.

    美国逃不了破坏裁军会议的罪责
    朝报指出决不能对帝国主义抱有任何不现实的幻想
    阿报揭露美国把裁军会谈作为掩盖侵略计划的幕布
    新华社平壤30日电　平壤各报29日发表评论，谴责以美帝国主义为首的西方国家破坏十国裁军会议的行为。
    “劳动新闻”的评论指出，西方帝国主义者破坏十国裁军会议的可恶行为证明，美帝国主义是在疯狂加紧备战、加剧国际紧张局势，它是人类的凶恶的敌人。朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一道坚决谴责帝国主义者对和平和安全进行严重挑衅的粗暴行动。评论说，一切事实证明，破坏裁军会谈的责任全在于美帝国主义及其追随者。西方帝国主义者自从开始会谈以来没有提出过一次建设性的建议，而破坏了会谈后还说什么“正在准备新建议”，阴谋把破坏会谈的责任转嫁给苏联。全世界人民清楚地知道，这也是同破坏了四国首脑会议后企图把责任转嫁给苏联而遭到破产的强盗的逻辑是一样的。裁军会谈的整个过程，表明美帝国主义及其追随者实际上不是想裁军，而是企图以空谈裁军来欺骗人民、疯狂地阴谋获得时间准备新战争。
    评论说，帝国主义统治集团破坏十国裁军委员会的工作明白地证明，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者继续挣扎、追求“实力”政策。这说明一切爱好和平的力量必须团结起来，更加警惕美帝国主义及其追随者的阴谋诡计，为世界和平和人类安全进一步加强斗争。
      “民主朝鲜报”的评论说，破坏了十国裁军委员会工作的美帝国主义的一贯玩弄的两面手法，使它们自己在全世界人民面前更加孤立了，并给对帝国主义抱有不现实的幻想的人们敲起了警钟。
    评论强调说，全世界人民必须揭露和粉碎美帝国主义的这种强盗般的挑战，并提高应有的警惕。人民决不能对帝国主义抱任何幻想，必须时刻记住，和平不是乞求的，而必须通过顽强的斗争去争取。
    新华社地拉那6月30日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”6月29日发表评论，谴责美国和其他西方国家破坏十国裁军委员会会议。
    评论说，华盛顿的领导集团及其追随者在破坏了巴黎四国首脑会议以后，不顾世界舆论的要求，继续执行声名狼藉的“实力地位”政策，制订加强军事侵略集团、继续进行军备竞赛的新计划。而现在美国领导集团及其追随者又破坏了十国裁军委员会的谈判。
    评论说，参加裁军谈判的美国和西方其他国家代表团一连三个星期只是空喊他们对裁军感兴趣，同时却对苏联的裁军新建议没有作出任何具体的回答，没有提出任何肯定的计划。显而易见，他们的目的是：继续以会谈装门面，把十国裁军委员会作为欺骗舆论的假面具，作为掩盖他们继续执行侵略计划的幕布。他们在会上使用了拖延和无休止的争论的策略，在会外则制订危险的计划。
    评论接着揭露说，当美国国会通过了和平时期最高的军事预算时，说关心裁军的空话有什么用呢？当通过决定以原子武装装备的美英飞机在社会主义阵营国家边界附近地区进行巡逻飞行，当有人不顾违背日本人民的切身利益而不遗余力地使得肮脏的日美军事条约获得“批准”时，关于关心裁军的空谈有什么价值呢？
    评论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对以美帝国主义为首的破坏了日内瓦会谈的帝国主义侵略集团表示深深的仇视。
