Today, this newspaper publishes a survey report written by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Working Group: "Introducing the Leadership Methods of Three Production Teams." This is a very good survey report and deserves careful reading. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee's practice of sending capable cadres to form working groups, going deep into the production teams, and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is worthy of advocacy and promotion. This not only improves and enhances the leadership and management levels of grassroots organizations, but also further consolidates and elevates the rural people's communes. Party organizations at all levels in various regions should also systematically organize cadres to go deep into the communes, production brigades, production teams, and even public canteens and various specialized work groups, to conduct thorough investigation and research, summarize the experiences there, and promote them, so as to elevate the rural people's communes from their current foundation to a new level.

Our country's rural people's communes, after continuous consolidation and improvement, have embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development, and have demonstrated unparalleled superiority and strong vitality in the practice of various construction undertakings in rural areas. However, the superiority and strong vitality of the rural people's communes in all aspects have not been fully brought into play. This emerging social organization, in terms of business management methods for various production undertakings, in terms of rules and regulations for various tasks, and in terms of the work style and methods of cadres, cannot be said to have reached a state of perfection. In other words, there are still aspects of the superstructure that are not adapted to the development of the economic base and the development of the productive relations and productive forces. The existence of this phenomenon is not surprising and is in accordance with objective laws. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that in our country, "socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces. In addition to this situation of both adaptation and contradiction between the relations of production and the development of productive forces, there is also a situation of both adaptation and contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base." He also profoundly pointed out that only by facing these contradictions squarely and continuously resolving them can we promote the leap forward of socialist construction. New contradictions will emerge after the old contradictions are resolved, "Contradictions constantly emerge and are constantly resolved, which is the dialectical law of the development of things."

Our rural people's communes, this new type of productive relationship, is suitable for the development needs of rural productive forces in our country. The emergence of this new social organization has further promoted productive forces and promoted the great development of agricultural production and the entire rural economy in our country, embarking on a new stage of continuous leap forward development. After several rectifications, the people's communes established various rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are adapted to the current situation of the rural people's communes, thus enabling the rural people's communes to embark on a path of consolidation and sound development. This is one aspect of the issue. However, there is another aspect, the aspect of maladaptation, that is, the aspect of contradiction: some of the rules and regulations of the rural people's communes are very imperfect, and there are still shortcomings in certain links of some of the more mature rules and regulations; many cadres still have varying degrees of bureaucratism in their work, and some aspects of their work methods are still unable to fully adapt to the needs of the large-scale collective economy of the rural people's communes, which is "combining government and commune," closely integrating workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. All these aspects need to be further improved and further elevated. In socialist society, the situation of both adaptation and contradiction between the relations of production and productive force, and between the superstructure and the economic base is an objective law. In the rural people's communes, it is of course no exception. In particular, our rural people's communes have not been established for a long time, and there are relatively more aspects of maladaptation in some links. Any perfect system is formed through gradual development and continuous improvement, and it is impossible to be perfect from the very beginning. The history of the development, consolidation, and improvement of agricultural production cooperatives in our country in the past fully proves this point. Our rural people's communes are a brand-new social organization, which is more advanced and more complex than the original agricultural cooperatives, and must also go through a certain period of time and a process of continuous improvement in order to form a relatively complete set of rules and regulations and management methods; and even after these rules and regulations and these work methods are relatively mature, they cannot be fixed and unchanging, and they are still in a process of continuous development and continuous improvement. In order to adapt to and promote the continued development of productive forces, various aspects of the relations of production need to be adjusted at any time, and various aspects of the superstructure built on this economic base also need to be constantly innovated. Between productive forces and relations of production, and between the economic base and the superstructure, contradictions constantly arise and are overcome, and are overcome and arise again. This is a dialectical process of constant flow and eternal youth. It is precisely because we can continuously adjust and innovate the socialist relations of production and its superstructure according to actual needs that we can smoothly promote the continuous upsurge of productive forces. Now the question before party organizations at all levels and rural work cadres at all levels is how to speed up this process of development and maturity, so that various aspects of the superstructure of the rural people's communes, such as management systems, especially production management systems, labor management systems, financial management systems, etc.; such as leadership style and work methods, especially the work style of going deep into the masses and the fields, overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, participating in production and leading production, combining points and areas, and using points to lead areas, etc., can be perfected more quickly, so that they are more suitable for the needs of changes and development of productive relations and productive forces, and promote the further consolidation and improvement of the rural people's communes, and promote the more rapid development of agricultural production and the rural economy. The establishment and continuous improvement of the superstructure is not something that can be achieved by subjectively formulating a few rules or devising a few systems, but it is a reflection of the economic base, and it is the result of repeated practice by the people on the new production base. Therefore, in order to make the superstructure more quickly perfect and continue to improve, the only correct method is to go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, conduct thorough investigation and research, and summarize the wisdom, creativity, and experience of the masses.

The superstructure is built on the economic base and is determined by the economic base. What kind of economic base there is, there is what kind of superstructure. When the economic base develops, the superstructure must also have corresponding changes. However, this should not lead to underestimating the huge dynamic role of the superstructure. Once a superstructure adapted to a certain economic base is established, it becomes a huge material force, which in turn acts on the economic base and promotes the further development of the economic base. The entire development process of our national economy is a very good illustration. In order to meet the requirements of the restoration and development of the national economy, we carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and implemented democratic management in various enterprises. After these changes, during the First Five-Year Plan period, our national economy developed more rapidly. On the basis of the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, our party, in accordance with the requirements of economic development, promptly formulated the general line for socialist construction, and put forward a complete set of "simultaneous development" and "walking on two legs" policies. Under the guidance of this policy, the national economy achieved a great victory of sustained leap forward with both high speed and proportion. From this wave of development that is higher than the previous wave, we can see very clearly the huge dynamic role of the superstructure on the economic base. Therefore, strengthening the leadership over the rural people's communes, establishing and improving various management systems and work systems of the rural people's communes, and better organizing the production and life of the rural people's communes, so as to enable the rural people's communes to increasingly fully undertake the great mission of promoting the forward development of productive forces and relations of production, is a very important political task for party organizations at all levels and rural work cadres.

In order to continuously improve the level of leadership and management of rural communes, consolidate and develop the rules and regulations of various production undertakings and various tasks of the people's communes, it is a very effective method to organize working groups to go deep into the lower levels to summarize experience. But this method alone is not enough. We should mobilize more cadres to carry out this work, especially the responsible comrades of party committees at all levels to participate in this work personally, so as to achieve even greater results. At present, leading cadres at all levels and the vast number of rural work cadres have gone deep into the masses and the fields, eating, living, working, and discussing with the vast number of commune members, and are active on the front line of production, leading production by participating in production. This is a very favorable condition for completing the important task of improving the rural people's communes. The leadership should make full use of this condition, and the cadres who go deep into the front line should also happily shoulder this responsibility. Senior cadres going deep into the fields and the front line of production is the best way to help and train grassroots cadres, improve the communist consciousness of grassroots cadres, and improve the style and methods of leadership; it is the best way to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and between leaders and the led. However, this is not the ultimate goal, or rather, all of this is for the ultimate goal, that is, to do a good job and develop production; that is to say, cadres at all levels go deep into the fields and the front line to participate in production in order to lead production. We have repeatedly emphasized that cadres should set an example, and should appear in the posture of ordinary laborers, but this is not simply to require cadres to play a leading role in production, and only become a model worker; it is not even to require cadres to only play the role of an ordinary laborer, but to require to improve the communist consciousness of cadres through "four togethers," and establish the work style and work methods of Marxism-Leninism; but to require to summarize the wisdom, creativity, and experience of the masses through "four togethers," make them systematic, or rise to theory, or rise to policy guidelines, or rise to rules and regulations, so as to more effectively lead the various tasks of the rural people's communes and better develop them. Therefore, all cadres should be like Yang Lijun, the captain of the Dengjiadian Middle Shop Team of the Lutou Commune in Zaoyang, Hubei, who is both a good actor (leading production) and a good director (commanding production), and cannot reduce the director to the level of simply completing the actor's task.

Improving the style and methods of cadres, establishing various management systems and work systems, and improving the leadership and management levels of organizations at all levels of the rural people's communes, so that the superstructure and the economic base, and the development of productive relations and productive forces are more adapted, are important measures to further consolidate and improve the rural people's communes and promote the development of the national economy. All rural work cadres should attach great importance to this matter.

### 把农村人民公社再提高一步

    把农村人民公社再提高一步
    今天，本报发表了湖北省委工作组写的一篇调查报告：“介绍三个生产小队的领导方法”。这是一篇很好的调查报告，值得认真阅读。湖北省委这种派得力干部组成工作组，深入生产小队，总结推广先进经验的做法，值得提倡和推广。这样作，不仅改进和提高了基层组织的领导水平和管理水平，也进一步巩固和提高了农村人民公社。各地各级党组织也应该有计划地组织干部，深入公社、生产队、生产小队以至公共食堂和各种专业作业小组，认真进行调查研究，把那里的经验总结起来，推广开去，把农村人民公社从现有的基础上再提高一步。
    我国的农村人民公社，经过不断地整顿提高，已经走上了巩固和健全发展的道路，并在农村各项建设事业的实践中显示了无比的优越性和强大的生命力。但是，农村人民公社各方面的优越性和强大的生命力还没有充分地发挥出来。这一新兴的社会组织，在各项生产事业的经营管理的方法、在各项工作的规章制度和在干部的工作作风、工作方法等等方面，还不能说已经达到了尽善尽美的境地，换句话说，也就是上层建筑和经济基础、生产关系和生产力的发展还有不相适应之处。这种现象的存在是不足为奇的，是合乎客观规律的。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中曾经指出，在我国“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是有矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况”。并且深刻指出：只有正视这些矛盾，并且不断解决这些矛盾，才能推动社会主义建设事业飞跃向前。旧的矛盾解决了，又会出现新的矛盾，“矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律。”
    我们的农村人民公社这种新的生产关系，是适合我国农村生产力发展需要的，这个新的社会组织一出现，又进一步推动了生产力，促进我国的农业生产和整个农村经济有了很大的发展，走上了持续跃进的新的发展阶段。经过几次整顿，人民公社建立了各种规章制度。这些规章制度是适应农村人民公社当前的情况的，因而使农村人民公社走上了巩固健全的道路。这是问题的一个方面。但是，还有另外一个方面，不相适应亦即矛盾的方面：农村人民公社有些规章制度很不完善，某些比较成熟的规章制度的某些环节上也还有缺点；不少干部在工作中还存在程度不同的官僚主义作风，工作方法的某些方面还不能完全适应农村人民公社这种“政社合一”、工农商学兵密切结合、农林牧副渔全面发展的大规模集体经济的需要。这种种方面都需要进一步改进，进一步提高。在社会主义社会中，生产关系和生产力、上层建筑和经济基础又相适应又相矛盾是一种客观规律，体现在农村人民公社方面，当然也不能例外。特别是我们的农村人民公社成立的时间还不太久，某些环节上不相适应的地方也显得比较多一些。任何一种完善的制度，都是逐步发展和不断提高所形成的，都不可能一产生就是完美无缺的。过去我国的农业生产合作社的发展、巩固和提高的历史，完全证明了这一点。我们的农村人民公社是一种全新的社会组织，比原来的农业合作社更高级更复杂得多，也必须经过一定的时间和一个不断改进提高的过程，才能形成一套比较完整的规章制度和经营管理方法；而且这些规章制度和这些工作方法比较成熟之后，也不能是固定不变的，它们仍然处在不断发展不断完善的过程中。为了适应和推动生产力继续向前发展，生产关系的各个方面，随时需要进行调整，建立在这种经济基础上的上层建筑的各个方面，也需要不断革新。在生产力和生产关系之间，在经济基础和上层建筑之间，矛盾不断地产生而又克服，克服而又产生，这是一个川流不息、万古长青的辩证过程。正因为我们对社会主义的生产关系和它的上层建筑能够按照实际需要加以不断的调整和革新，所以才能够顺利地推动生产力的不断高涨。现在摆在各级党组织和各级农村工作干部面前的问题是，如何加快这种发展成熟的过程，使农村人民公社的上层建筑的各个方面，如经营管理制度，其中特别是生产管理制度、劳动管理制度、财务管理制度等等；如领导作风和工作方法，其中特别是深入群众深入田间的工作作风、统筹兼顾全面安排、参加生产领导生产、点面结合以点带面等工作方法，更迅速地完善起来，使之更适合生产关系和生产力变化和发展的需要，促进农村人民公社更进一步巩固和提高，促进农业生产和农村经济更迅速的发展。上层建筑的建立和不断完善，不是谁主观上定出几条规章、想出几种制度所能奏效的，而是经济基础的反映，是人民群众在新的生产基础上反复实践的结果，因此，要使上层建筑更加迅速地完善起来并继续改进，唯一正确的方法是深入实际、深入群众，认真地作调查研究，把群众的智慧、群众的创造和群众的经验总结起来。
    上层建筑是在经济基础上建立起来的，并且是由经济基础决定的。有怎样的经济基础，就有怎样的上层建筑。经济基础发展了，上层建筑也必须有与之相适应的改变。但并不能由此轻视上层建筑的巨大的能动作用。适应于某一经济基础的上层建筑一旦建立，它便成了一支巨大的物质力量，反转来又作用于经济基础，推动经济基础的更加发展。我国国民经济的整个发展过程，就是一个很好的说明。适应国民经济恢复和发展的要求，我们进行了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并在各种企业中实行民主管理，经过这些改变，在第一个五年计划期间，我国国民经济有了更快的发展。在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上，我们党又根据经济发展的要求，及时制定了社会主义建设总路线，并提出了一整套的“并举”和“两条腿走路”的方针，在这个方针的指导下，国民经济又取得了既高速度又按比例的持续跃进的伟大胜利。从这一浪高过一浪的发展中，可以非常清楚地看出上层建筑对经济基础巨大的能动作用。因此，加强对农村人民公社的领导，确立和健全农村人民公社的各种经营管理制度和工作制度，更好地组织农村人民公社的生产和生活，以便使农村人民公社日益完满地担负起促进生产力和生产关系向前发展的伟大使命，是各级党组织和农村工作干部的一个十分重要的政治任务。
    为了不断提高对农村公社的领导水平和管理水平，巩固并发展人民公社各项生产事业和各项工作的规章制度，组织工作组深入下层总结经验，是一个很有效的方法。但光靠这个办法是不够的，应该发动更多的干部来进行这个工作，特别是各级党委的负责同志亲自参加这个工作，才能收到更为巨大的效果。目前各级领导干部和广大农村工作干部已经深入群众深入田间，同广大社员群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，活跃在生产第一线，以参加生产的方法来领导生产，这是完成提高农村人民公社这一重大任务的非常有利的条件。领导上要充分运用这个条件，深入第一线的干部也应当愉快地担负起这个责任来。上级干部深入田间深入生产第一线，是帮助和培养基层干部，提高基层干部共产主义觉悟，改进领导作风和工作方法的一个最好办法；是改善干部和群众、领导和被领导的关系的一个最好办法。但是，这并不是最后目的，或者说，这一切都是为着最后目的，即搞好工作，发展生产；也就是说各级干部深入田间、深入第一线参加生产，是为了领导生产。我们一再强调干部要以身作则，要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，但这并不是单纯地要求干部在生产中只是起带头作用，仅仅成为一个劳动模范；更不是要干部只起一个普通劳动者的作用，而是要求通过“四同”提高干部的共产主义觉悟，树立马克思列宁主义的工作作风和工作方法；而是要求通过“四同”把群众的智慧、群众的创造和群众的经验加以总结，使之条理化，或者上升为理论，或者上升为政策方针，或者上升为规章制度，以便更有效地领导农村人民公社的各种工作更好地开展起来。因此所有干部都要像湖北枣阳鹿头公社邓家店中店小队小队长杨立钧那样，既是一个好演员（带头生产），又要做一个好导演（指挥生产），而不能把导演降到单纯完成演员任务的水平。
    改进干部作风和工作方法，建立各种经营管理制度和工作制度，提高农村人民公社各级组织的领导水平和管理水平，使上层建筑和经济基础、生产关系和生产力的发展更加适应，是进一步巩固提高农村人民公社和促进国民经济发展的重要措施，全体农村工作干部应该十分重视这件事情。
