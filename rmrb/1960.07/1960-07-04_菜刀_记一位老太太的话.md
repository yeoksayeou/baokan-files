    Cleaver
    ——Remembering an Old Woman's Words
    Dù Ruò
    Don't mind its rusty look,
    Its history is truly glorious!
    When the Red Army passed through Zunyi City,
    I used it to chop vegetables for the soldiers.
    After the Red Army left, the White bandits came,
    It specialized in chopping the heads of those bandit dogs.
    My old man lost his life because of it,
    With tears I buried it deep.
    Only after liberation did it see the light of day again,
    I dressed it in silk and hung it up with fanfare.
    Yesterday, when the canteen was established,
    I sharpened it, oh so quickly.
    Haha, old eyes see such wondrous things,
    Let it taste the fresh vegetables of socialism!

    杜若别看它满身铁锈，它的历史真光采！红军经过遵义城，我用它给战士切过菜。红军走了白匪来，它专砍贼子狗脑袋。老伴因此丢了命，我含泪把它深深埋。解放才得见天日，我给它披绸挂上采。昨天食堂成立起，我磨呀磨得快又快。哈哈，老眼尽看稀奇事，让它尝尝社会主义新鲜菜！
