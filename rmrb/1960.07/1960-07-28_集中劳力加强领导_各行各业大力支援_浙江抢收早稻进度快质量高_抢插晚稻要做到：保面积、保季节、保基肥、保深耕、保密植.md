Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 27th: The early rice harvest and late rice planting in Zhejiang Province are unfolding from south to north. As of July 22nd, over 5.2 million mu have been harvested, and approximately 2 million mu of late rice have been planted. The broad masses of commune members are joyfully harvesting early rice and planting late rice simultaneously, presenting a vibrant scene of harvest and activity throughout the province's rural areas.

Party committees at all levels, recognizing the heavy tasks, vast acreage, tight season, and high requirements of the early rice harvest and late rice planting, have strengthened their leadership over these tasks. Various localities have made every effort to tap labor resources, concentrating over 80% of the agricultural labor force into the harvest and planting, and have organized approximately 2 million people from all sectors to support these efforts. Over 200,000 cadres at six levels throughout the province have gone deep into the front lines of the harvest and planting, participating in production and leading production. After participating in labor, leading cadres also took the lead in using new tools, allowing over 1 million sickles and tens of thousands of rice threshers to demonstrate their power in the early rice harvest.

Due to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels over the harvest and planting, communes in various localities have brought their great superiority into play, resulting in fast progress and high quality in the early rice harvest. Recently, the harvest has entered its peak period, with the daily harvest progress increasing by over 20% compared to the same period last year. Since July 19th, the Wenzhou area of southern Zhejiang, where the season is earlier, has concentrated over 2 million people, representing over 80% of the agricultural labor force in the area, into the harvest and planting, greatly accelerating the harvest speed. By July 22nd, over two-thirds of the early rice had been harvested. In the four counties of Pingyang, Ruian, Yueqing, and Wenling, and in the city of Wenzhou, over 80% of the early rice has been harvested.

During the harvesting process, various localities have tightly grasped every step, including cutting, transporting, threshing, drying, and storing, to ensure careful harvesting and that every grain is returned to the granary. After the Wenzhou Special District promoted the experience of "harvesting at eight-tenths maturity to ensure a ten-tenths yield," the phenomenon of early rice yellowing and dropping large grains was greatly reduced, ensuring that the early rice harvest was both fast and good. Throughout the province, the "Hua Mulan" group of the Xinqi Commune in Ruian County, a model of careful harvesting and threshing, was used as an example. The experience of careful rice harvesting and threshing from last year was widely summarized, tools were further reformed, and operating methods were improved, greatly improving the quality of this year's early rice harvest.

While tensely harvesting early rice, various localities are also actively planting successive late rice, striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year, according to the "Five Guarantees" requirements for late rice: ensure acreage, ensure season, ensure base fertilizer, ensure deep plowing, and ensure close planting. The late rice that has already been planted has generally been plowed and fertilized with base fertilizer, and generally meets the requirements for close planting, with over 30,000 seedlings planted per mu.

Currently, a national summer harvest and planting campaign is underway in the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25th: The work of rushing to harvest early rice and plant late rice in Zhejiang Province has begun in full swing. Under the guidance of the idea that "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy," various fronts and industries across the province have promoted the spirit of communist cooperation and vigorously supported the summer harvest and planting.

Before the "Double Rush," leaders at all levels in Zhejiang Province conducted extensive and in-depth ideological education work in all walks of life. Through various meetings and visits to rural people's communes and other activities, they improved the awareness of people in all walks of life about "agriculture being the foundation of the national economy" and consciously regarded supporting agriculture as their important task.

Employees in the industrial sector actively manufacture and repair various new and old agricultural tools to support the early rice harvest and late rice planting. In the process of manufacturing rice transplanters, the Shaoxing County No. 1 Rice Transplanter Factory implemented a three-way combination method involving designers, manufacturers, and users to ensure quality. Workers went to the fields to design and test with farmers to ensure quality. At present, industries and handicrafts across the province have organized 160,000 workers to go deep into the fields and establish mobile repair teams to repair and use at the same time.

Employees of commercial departments actively deliver goods to the countryside and to the fields. The counties in Wenzhou Special District organized more than 42,000 commercial employees to deliver goods to the countryside to ensure the supply of production and living materials during the "Double Rush" period. Qing Tian County recently added 315 sales agencies and 51 rural supply points in rural areas, and added 121 peddlers to ensure that daily necessities were supplied to every team and that non-staple foods were supplied directly to the canteens.

Medical staff in various places have established a large number of rural mobile treatment teams to go deep into the fields and canteens to prevent and treat diseases. In addition, cadres from various agencies, officers and soldiers of the stationed troops, urban residents, and teachers and students of schools have organized rush harvest and planting assault teams to participate in labor in communes and production teams with heavy harvesting and planting tasks. Wenzhou Special District has 340,000 students involved in the rush harvest and planting battle.

    集中劳力加强领导　各行各业大力支援
    浙江抢收早稻进度快质量高
    抢插晚稻要做到：保面积、保季节、保基肥、保深耕、保密植
    新华社杭州27日电　浙江省收早稻、种晚稻由南到北全面展开。到7月22日，全省已收割五百二十多万亩，抢种晚稻约二百万亩。广大公社社员怀着喜悦的心情边抢收早稻，边插种晚稻，全省农村呈现一片丰收和繁忙景象。
    各级党委根据收早稻、种晚稻的任务重、面积大、季节紧、要求高等特点，都加强了对收、种工作的领导。各地千方百计挖掘劳动力，集中了80％以上农业劳动力投入抢收抢种，并且组织各行各业二百万人左右支援收、种工作。全省六级干部共有二十多万名深入抢收抢种第一线，参加生产，领导生产。各级领导和干部参加劳动后，并带头使用新式工具，使一百多万把大镰刀和几万部打稻机在收割早稻中发挥了威力。
    由于各级党委加强了收、种工作的领导，各地公社发挥了巨大优越性，使早稻收割进度快、质量高。最近全面进入旺收期间，收获日进度比去年同期增加20％以上。季节较早的浙南温州地区从7月19日以来，集中了二百多万人，占全区农业劳动力80％以上的劳力投入抢收抢种，收割速度大大加快，到7月22日止，已收获早稻三分之二以上。平阳、瑞安、乐清、温岭等四个县和温州市，早稻已收获了80％以上。
    在收获过程中各地都抓紧割、运、打、晒、入库等各个环节，保证细收细打，颗粒归仓。温州专区推广了“八成熟十成收”的经验后，大大减轻了早稻黄熟掉大粒的现象，使早稻收获既快又好。全省各地还以细收细打标兵—瑞安县莘塍公社“花木兰”小组为榜样，普遍总结去年水稻细收细打经验，进一步改革工具，改进操作方法，使今年早稻收获工作质量大大提高。
    在紧张收获早稻同时，各地还根据晚稻保面积、保季节、保基肥、保深耕、保密植的“五保”要求，积极插种连作晚稻，力争全年丰收。已插下的晚稻普遍经过翻耕并施了基肥，一般都符合密植要求，每亩插秧三万丛以上。
    目前，一个全民性的夏收夏种运动，正在全省紧张的进行。
    据新华社杭州25日电　浙江省抢收早稻抢种晚稻工作全面开始。全省各个战线、各个行业在“农业是国民经济基础”的思想指导下，发扬了共产主义协作精神，大力支援夏收夏种。
  浙江省各级领导在“双抢”之前，就广泛深入地在各行各业中进行了思想教育工作，通过各种会议和访问农村人民公社等活动，提高了各行各业人员对“农业是国民经济基础”的认识，自觉地把支援农业作为自己的重要任务。
    工业部门的职工积极制造和修配各种新旧农具支援收早稻种晚稻。绍兴县第一插秧机厂在制造插秧机中，为保证质量，实行了设计者、制造者、使用者三结合方法，工人下田和农民一起实地设计，实地试验，保证质量。目前，全省各地工业、手工业又组织了十六万名工人，深入田间，建立了巡回修理组，作到边修理、边使用。
    商业部门职工，积极送货下乡，送货到田头。温州专区各县组织了四万二千多商业职工，送货下乡，保证双抢期间的生产、生活资料的供应。青田县最近在农村中增设了三百一十五个代销店和五十一个农村供应点，并增设了一百二十一个货郎担，做到队队有日用品供应、副食品一直供应到食堂。
    各地的医务人员，建立了大批的农村巡回治疗组，深入田间、食堂，防治疾病。此外，各地机关干部、驻军官兵、城镇居民和学校师生，都纷纷组织抢收抢种突击队，到收种任务繁重的公社、生产队参加劳动。温州专区已有三十四万学生，投入抢收抢种战斗。
