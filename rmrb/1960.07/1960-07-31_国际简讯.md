	U.S. Rocket Carrying Manned Capsule Fails in Launch
	Cape Canaveral (United States) Dispatch: The United States' attempt on the 29th to test-launch an "Atlas" rocket with a capsule intended to carry a man failed.
	The capsule was mounted on the rocket's nose. Sixty-five seconds after the rocket lifted off from the launch site at Cape Canaveral, radio contact with the ground was lost. U.S. officials later claimed that there may have been an explosion or structural failure, causing the test to fail. It is believed that the capsule and rocket fell into the Atlantic Ocean about six to nineteen kilometers from the coast.

	U.S. Fires Continue to Spread
	Los Angeles Dispatch: The fires that have been raging for a week in forests and grasslands of the western United States continue to spread. The fires have already destroyed property over hundreds of thousands of acres. This is the most ferocious fire in the western United States in thirty years, and so far, thirteen people have died. A fire has restarted in southern California, twenty-five miles northwest of Los Angeles, and the fire is spreading towards a "Nike" missile base. It is reported that the fire is only one mile from the base.

	Britain Gives Singapore Financial and Military "Aid"
	London Dispatch: British Colonial Secretary Macleod announced in the House of Commons on the 29th that Britain would give Singapore £7.6 million in financial "aid," as well as five years of military "aid" (at £500,000 per year). He emphasized that the British government has a "dual interest" in "Singapore's military strength."

	British Juvenile Crime Soars
	London Dispatch: MP Brown said in the House of Commons on the 29th that the number of juvenile criminals in Britain has increased from 67,724 in 1956 to 99,559 last year, which is unprecedented in British history. In the past four years, the number of juvenile criminals has increased by more than 10,000 each year.

	Chilean City of Valdivia Hit by Major Flooding
	Santiago Dispatch: The city of Valdivia, Chile, located on the Pacific coast 1,000 kilometers south of the capital Santiago, has been hit by severe flooding. After a series of violent earthquakes, the mouth of Lake Rinihue, 100 kilometers east of Valdivia, was blocked, and the water level continued to rise. The lake water is now overflowing and rushing towards low-lying areas such as Valdivia, which flow into the sea. The current winter rains have aggravated the severity of the flooding.
	Many low-lying areas of Valdivia have been flooded by water more than three feet deep. Rail traffic to Valdivia has been cut off.
