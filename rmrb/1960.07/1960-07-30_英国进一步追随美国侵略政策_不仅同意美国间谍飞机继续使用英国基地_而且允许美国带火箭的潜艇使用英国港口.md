Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th: British and American officials in Washington have reached an agreement on the United States using British military bases to continue spy flights against the Soviet Union. News from Washington today says that the talks held there between officials of the two governments have concluded "satisfactorily." No detailed content of the talks was released. However, State Department Press Officer Lincoln White revealed in Washington that the agreement between Truman and Attlee reached in 1951 regarding American bases in Britain would not be modified. Other US officials said that a system had been drafted to notify British authorities before American spy planes take off from British bases.

Christopher Dobson, the "Daily Express" correspondent in Washington, reported from Washington today that there is a growing feeling that the scope of discussions between British and American officials is much broader than previously imagined. Dobson quoted a news item published in today's American newspapers, saying that the agreement not only involves the continued use of British bases by American aircraft, but also involves the use of British ports by American nuclear-powered submarines equipped with "Polaris" rockets.

    英国进一步追随美国侵略政策
    不仅同意美国间谍飞机继续使用英国基地
    而且允许美国带火箭的潜艇使用英国港口
    据新华社伦敦29日电　美英两国官员在华盛顿达成了关于美国使用英国军事基地来继续对苏联进行间谍飞行的协议。今天来自华盛顿的消息说，两国政府官员在那里举行的会谈已经“圆满”结束。没有发表会谈的详细内容。但是，国务院新闻发布官林肯·怀特在华盛顿透露，不修改杜鲁门和艾德礼在1951年达成的关于美国在英国的基地的协议。其他美国官员说，拟订了美国间谍飞机从英国基地上起飞之前通知英国当局的制度。
    “每日快报”驻华盛顿记者克里斯托弗·多布森今天从华盛顿报道说，人们愈来愈感到，美英两国官员讨论的范围要比以前想像的广泛得多。多布森引用登载在今天的美国报纸上的一则消息说，达成的协议不仅涉及美国飞机继续使用英国基地的问题，并且还涉及配备着“北极星”式火箭的美国核发动的潜水艇使用英国港口的问题。
