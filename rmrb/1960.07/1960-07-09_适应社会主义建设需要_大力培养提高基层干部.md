Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, our socialist construction is developing rapidly and continuously. Rural people's communes have embarked on the path of consolidation and sound development, and cities are also about to realize people's communization; the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements have entered a new high tide. Under this new situation, the Party has put forward higher requirements for grassroots cadres. The Party's grassroots cadres are large in number, widely distributed, and completely integrated with the masses' production and life. They are the bridge between the Party and the masses, and the specific executors of the Party's lines, principles, and policies. The Party needs to gather the opinions of the masses through them as the basis for formulating lines, principles, and policies; the Party needs them to regularly conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and organizational work among the people to correctly implement the correct lines, principles, and policies among the masses. Grassroots cadres are also the direct leaders and organizers of the people's production and life. They must not only lead the production of a production team or a workshop, but also organize the lives of hundreds or thousands of people. Therefore, vigorously training and improving the political and ideological level and professional work ability of grassroots cadres is an extremely important political and organizational task of the Party.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached great importance to training and improving grassroots cadres. As early as 1925 and 1926, Comrade Mao Zedong presided over the National Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangdong, dedicated to training cadres to lead the peasant movement. In 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in his article "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War": In the great struggle of the Chinese people, many activists and working cadres have emerged and are continuing to emerge. Our responsibility is to organize them, train them, and enable them to continuously improve in their work. Now, the Party Central Committee is teaching our broad masses of cadres to study hard, think seriously, and greatly improve their political, theoretical, and professional levels within a few years. Our Party's grassroots cadres, like all cadres, have grown and become stronger under the close care of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The Anhui Party organization, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, has done a lot of work in training and improving grassroots cadres over the years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and has trained a large number of grassroots cadres. After a long period of education by the Party and the tempering of actual struggles and productive labor, the broad masses of grassroots cadres have greatly improved in terms of political consciousness, working ability, and cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. They are energetic, enthusiastic, and have revolutionary ambitions and a down-to-earth work style. They have done a great deal of work and played a huge role in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Based on the practice of the past few years, we have realized that to do a good job in training and improving grassroots cadres, first of all, Party organizations at all levels must attach sufficient importance to it ideologically. This is the key to doing this work well. The Party organizations at all levels in Anhui have always attached importance to training and improving grassroots cadres, but some comrades do not have sufficient understanding and do not pay enough attention to it. One is to oppose training and improving grassroots cadres to the completion of work tasks. They believe that "production and work are busy, and there is no time for training," and even believe that production and work are "hard tasks" that must be completed, and that training and improving cadres are "soft tasks" that do not matter if they are not done well. The second is to emphasize difficulties. Regarding the establishment of Party schools and various cadre schools, they emphasize that there are no teachers, no teaching materials, no funds, and no equipment, so it is difficult to run them; they take a passive attitude towards the learning problems of grassroots cadres, believing that they have low cultural levels and cannot learn or learn well. Another is that they think that training cadres is different from other work. It is "a hundred-year plan" that can only be done slowly. Although all these ideas are expressed in different forms, the root cause is insufficient understanding of the important significance of training and improving grassroots cadres. They do not understand that the level of political and ideological awareness and the strength of professional work ability of grassroots cadres are directly related to whether grassroots work can be done well. Therefore, they use grassroots cadres a lot and educate them little, demand a lot from them and help them little. In order to solve these ideological problems, on the one hand, we vigorously publicize the important significance of training and improving grassroots cadres at various meetings and in newspapers and periodicals; on the other hand, we conduct free airing and debate to address various erroneous ideas; at the same time, we set an example and establish pacesetters, using facts to educate. Through these methods, we have improved understanding and overcome erroneous ideas, so that the work of training and improving grassroots cadres can be carried out smoothly. Facts have proved that wherever this is done, the work of training and improving grassroots cadres has achieved remarkable results. For example, when the Advanced Commune in Xuancheng County started a Party school, some leading cadres of the brigades were afraid of affecting production and did not allow Party members and cadres to study at the Party school. In addition to criticizing and educating these erroneous ideas, the commune Party committee actively ran the Party school, improved the cadres, and did a good job in its work, so that everyone realized that transferring Party members and cadres to the Party school for study not only did not affect production, but also promoted production. Because everyone improved their understanding, they actively demanded that Party members and cadres be transferred to the Party school to study. When Gaolou Commune in Lingbi County started spare-time schools, some cadres made excuses for being busy with production, having many difficulties, and having no way to do it. After free airing and debate, they improved their understanding, unified their thinking, solved the problems, and found ways to quickly form a high tide of running various spare-time schools.

Our requirements for training and improving grassroots cadres are determined based on the Party's cadre work policy of "both red and expert," "red to the core and expert to the depths," combined with the specific circumstances of grassroots cadres and the Party's political tasks in various periods. The main focus is to educate cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution, and to carry out education on two roads, two lines, and two methods in terms of politics, ideology, and work style, so that the broad masses of grassroots cadres have a high degree of socialist and communist consciousness and a firm proletarian stand; resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's various policies, and fight against all ideas and behaviors that violate the general line; better promote the fine tradition of the mass line, continuously improve work methods, closely connect with the masses, combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and have both great ambitions and be down-to-earth. At the same time, we must also organize grassroots cadres to actively study their professions, work hard to learn culture, science, and technology, and continuously improve their professional, cultural, scientific, and technological levels.

We have adopted various methods to train and improve grassroots cadres, which can be summarized as the four characters: do, train, learn, and rectify.

"Do" means to train and improve grassroots cadres in actual work. This is an important aspect of training and improving grassroots cadres. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is even more important learning." ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War") "Cadres and peasants will transform themselves in their own struggle experience. Let them do it, learn lessons in the process, and increase their talents. In this way, a large number of outstanding people will emerge." ("On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation") Practice has proved that the broad masses of grassroots cadres have gradually grown up through actual work and the tempering of various movements. For example, in the Great Steelmaking Movement in 1958, they transformed their thinking, improved their consciousness, and learned technology through the tempering of this movement, achieving the goal of both steelmaking and personnel training. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the broad masses of grassroots cadres set high ambitions and lofty goals, vigorously carried out tool reforms, and fiercely attacked the scientific and technological fortress, which not only promoted the development of the movement, but also tempered and improved themselves. Many of them have now become outstanding "native experts," engineers, and technicians.

When training and improving grassroots cadres in actual work, first of all, we adhered to putting politics in command and combining the abstract with the concrete. When holding meetings to discuss work, we not only studied and solved practical problems in the work, but also studied the Party's principles and policies. When arranging work, we not only explained the tasks, but also explained the policies and methods. When inspecting work, we not only checked the completion of the tasks, but also checked the implementation of the policies. At the same time, we also guided and helped them to regularly summarize their work, draw experience and lessons, improve their ideological level, and improve their work methods. The Provincial Party Committee and the Party committees of various counties and communes regularly hold six-level, five-level, four-level, and three-level cadre meetings. Most of the participants in these meetings are grassroots cadres. Through these meetings, they learned the theory and the Party's principles and policies, improved their ideological level and policy level, summarized their experiences, clarified their tasks, and improved their work style. Experience has proved that these meetings are one of the most important methods for training and improving grassroots cadres because of their strong leadership, rich content, and in-depth problem-solving.

Secondly, regarding the use of grassroots cadres, on the one hand, we must grasp tightly in terms of policies and principles, so as to facilitate unified understanding, unified action, and ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and principles; on the other hand, in actual work, we must boldly let them do it, so that they dare to take responsibility and can actively combine the Party's policies and principles with the actual conditions of the local area, actively complete the Party's various tasks, and train and improve their independent working ability.

Thirdly, we organize grassroots cadres to cultivate experimental fields, participate in production, and lead production. This is an effective way to make grassroots cadres both red and expert. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to this. As early as 1953, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee advocated and personally cultivated experimental fields. Under the advocacy and leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels in the province, as well as the broad masses of grassroots cadres, gradually and universally engaged in experimental fields. At the same time, the broad masses of grassroots cadres also participated in productive labor together with the masses in accordance with the time and requirements stipulated by the Provincial Party Committee. Facts have proved that grassroots cadres participating in productive labor and cultivating experimental fields can not only further go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and closely connect the relationship between cadres and the masses, improve their work style, but also timely discover problems, solve problems, increase their production knowledge, and better lead production.

"Train" means to run Party schools and various professional cadre schools well, and to train grassroots cadres in rotation in a planned way. Party schools and professional cadre schools are important places for more concentrated and systematic training and improvement of grassroots cadres. At present, in Anhui Province, there are more than 70 Party schools of prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees and nearly 100 professional cadre schools with grassroots cadres as the main training targets; more than 5,000 grassroots Party schools. In the past two years, a total of more than 3 million grassroots cadres have been trained. The political consciousness, policy level, cultural and scientific knowledge, and professional work ability of the grassroots cadres who have been trained have been rapidly improved. They said: "Learning is really good, like getting three treasures, consciousness can be improved, culture can be learned, and production technology and leadership methods are all available."

The content of our training of grassroots cadres is determined according to the Party's political tasks and central work. For example: In 1958, the main focus was on learning the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas." In the first half of 1959, the main focus was on learning the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and in the second half of 1959, the main focus was on learning the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In this way, the training work of Party schools and professional cadre schools can better serve the needs of the Party's political tasks and central work.

The form of Party school training is flexible and diverse. County Party schools and commune Party schools adopt a combination of centralized training and on-the-spot training according to the agricultural production season, work needs, and training targets. In general, training is concentrated in Party schools; in seasons when production is relatively busy, training is conducted on the spot at the grassroots level. There are generally two forms of on-the-spot training: one is to go to places with more advanced production and work, combined with on-site visits, summarize and exchange experiences, and train cadres; the other is to go to places with relatively poor work, training while helping with work, combining training cadres with transforming backward areas. In terms of the arrangement of training time, generally there is more training in winter and spring, and less training in summer and autumn; more training of leading backbone cadres during agricultural gaps, and more training of professional personnel during busy farming seasons. This not only effectively solves the contradiction between training and work and production, ensures that the Party school can adhere to training according to plan, but also enables training and work and production to be better closely combined and mutually promoted.

"Learn" means to vigorously run spare-time education and organize grassroots cadres to participate in spare-time learning. Spare-time schools are an important form of organizing the broad masses of grassroots cadres to learn politics, culture, and science and technology. All factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes in the province have established spare-time red and expert schools, technical schools, and cultural schools. Some of these spare-time schools are run by one unit, some are jointly run by several units; some are run by departments, and some are run by systems. Some have not only run primary and secondary spare-time schools, but also run higher spare-time schools. Some units have also formed a "one-stop" spare-time education system from primary school to university. In terms of teaching content, there are both political courses and cultural, scientific, and technological courses; both basic knowledge and professional knowledge are learned; both attention is paid to the current urgent needs, and attention is paid to systematic improvement. Experience has proved that to do a good job in spare-time learning, it is necessary to properly solve the contradiction between learning and production and work. If this problem is not solved, spare-time learning will be difficult to maintain. In order to solve this problem, in addition to strengthening education for grassroots cadres to improve their consciousness and initiative in learning, various localities have also adopted the following methods: (1) In terms of learning content, implement the policy of learning what to do, so that work and learning are twisted into one rope; (2) Properly arrange the time for work and learning and improve work methods; (3) Establish and improve necessary systems and regularly check and supervise. At the same time, a large number of part-time and full-time teaching staff have also been equipped and trained for communes, factories, mines, and enterprises. This is an important condition for consolidating spare-time learning. Through spare-time school learning, the political, cultural, and scientific and technological levels of the broad masses of grassroots cadres have been greatly improved. For example, since 1958, the commune and team cadres of Zhangcun Commune in Guoyang County have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, and have now completed more than 30 articles such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Through learning, they are more confident and high-spirited in building the cause of socialism, and generally reflect that "Chairman Mao's works are like a lighthouse, the more you learn, the brighter your heart becomes, your mind is liberated, you have enough energy, and all difficulties are swept away." Bengbu Dyeing and Weaving Factory has persisted in workers' spare-time education for eight years, and has gradually established a complete set of workers' spare-time education system from primary school to university. In 1952, more than 60% of the factory's workers were illiterate, and only 7% had a junior high school education, and none had a high school or university education; now more than 95% of the workers have reached a cultural level above senior elementary school, of which more than 70% have a junior high school education and 7% have a university education. Through spare-time education, more than 160 technical cadres and industrial management cadres and more than 470 technicians above Grade 3 have been trained, which not only meets the needs of the factory for technical cadres and technical workers, but also has transferred more than 60 cadres and more than 100 technicians above Grade 3 to support brother factories. In addition to universally running spare-time schools, various localities have also adopted methods such as organizing grassroots cadres into study groups according to production or work units, arranging for grassroots cadres with reading ability to study on their own, and holding regular or irregular report meetings to organize grassroots cadres to conduct spare-time learning, all of which have achieved good results.

"Rectify" means to conduct rectification campaigns. Rectification is one of the most effective methods for training and improving grassroots cadres. The previous rectification movements in Anhui, especially the two rectification movements in 1957 and 1959, have achieved great results. The broad masses of grassroots cadres have greatly improved their political and ideological consciousness, clarified the political direction, strengthened their confidence and determination to follow the socialist road, resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, promoted the Party's mass line and the work style of seeking truth from facts, and closely connected the relationship between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses.

The practice of rectifying the ideology and work style of grassroots cadres is to first conduct positive education through meetings, reports, and organizing the study of documents to improve understanding and correct attitudes; then adopt the method of the mass line, launch free airing and debates, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to fully expose the problems existing in ideology and work style; then, in response to these problems, conduct systematic education to improve them. At the same time, methods such as recollection, comparison, and exhibitions were also used to educate and improve grassroots cadres. For example, in the 1959 rectification movement, all communes and brigades in the province universally held "three ten-year" comparison exhibitions, which were extremely profound for the education of the broad masses of grassroots cadres.

In the rectification campaign, the policy of education and improvement was adhered to. For the problems existing in the ideology and work style of grassroots cadres, the policy of "unity-criticism-unity" and "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and treating the illness to save the patient" was adopted, both wholeheartedly helping them to correct their shortcomings and mistakes, and protecting and promoting their enthusiasm.

Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in training and improving grassroots cadres. The county Party committee and the commune Party committee are the direct leaders of grassroots cadres, have more contact with grassroots cadres, and are more familiar with them, so they have a major responsibility for training and improving grassroots cadres. In the past few years, the Party committees of various counties and communes in Anhui Province have attached importance to the work of training and improving grassroots cadres. They have all included this work in their important agenda, and have appointed a secretary to take charge, frequently study problems, promptly supervise and inspect, and continuously summarize and exchange experiences. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the organization and propaganda departments and other relevant departments have also listed this work as a regular and important task, strengthened specific guidance, timely solved various ideological and practical problems, specifically arranged the time for work, learning, and labor, and established and improved various systems, thereby ensuring that the work of training and improving grassroots cadres is regularized and institutionalized. At the same time, the local and county Party committees have also equipped and trained a large number of theoretical and cultural teaching staff for grassroots units such as communes and factories and mines. This has played a great role in strengthening the education of grassroots cadres.

Cadres who are transferred to lower levels and cadres who go to the grassroots to help with work are an important force in the work of training and improving grassroots cadres. Since the Great Leap Forward, the provincial, county and higher level agencies have transferred large numbers of cadres to lower levels to assume leadership positions, which has not only strengthened grassroots work, but also played an important role in training and improving grassroots cadres. Cadres from county-level and higher-level agencies who are transferred to lower levels for labor training and grassroots work training, as well as cadres who go to the grassroots to help with work, participate in labor on the one hand, train themselves, and on the other hand, help grassroots cadres do their work and study political theory and cultural and scientific knowledge. For example, since 1959, Fuyang Prefecture has successively transferred a large number of cadres to production teams for labor training and grassroots training. They not only helped these teams do their work well and trained and improved themselves, but also trained more than 1,000 grassroots cadres and activists. For example, Wuhe County, which originally had relatively backward work, dispatched a large number of capable cadres to stay and contract, fully mobilized the masses, and trained and selected a large number of outstanding grassroots cadres, which quickly changed the face of the county.

In the past few years, although the work of training and improving grassroots cadres in Anhui Province has achieved certain results and experience, it is still not enough compared with the needs of the development of the situation. Now, we are further strengthening our work in this area to improve the level of the broad masses of grassroots cadres better and faster, and to ensure the needs of the leapfrog development of the socialist construction cause.

    适应社会主义建设需要　大力培养提高基层干部
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　曾庆梅
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国社会主义建设事业正在高速度地、持续地向前发展。农村人民公社已经走上巩固、健全发展的道路，城市也即将实现人民公社化；技术革命、文化革命运动已进入一个新的高潮。在这种新的形势下，党对基层干部提出了更高的要求。党的基层干部，数量大、分布广、完全同群众生产、生活在一起。他们是党同群众联系的桥梁，是党的路线、方针、政策的具体执行者。党要通过他们把群众的意见集中起来，作为制定路线、方针、政策的依据；党要把正确的路线、方针、政策正确地贯彻到群众中去，又需要他们在人民群众中经常地进行深入细致的思想工作和组织工作。基层干部又是人民群众的生产、生活的直接领导者和组织者。他们既要领导好一个生产队、一个车间的生产，又要组织好几百人、几千人的生活。因此，大力培养提高基层干部的政治思想水平和业务工作能力，是党的一项极为重要的政治任务和组织任务。
    党中央和毛泽东同志对于培养提高基层干部，历来就很重视。早在1925年和1926年，毛泽东同志就在广东主持全国农民运动讲习所，致力于培养领导农民运动的干部。1938年，毛泽东同志在《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》一文中着重指出：在中国人民的伟大斗争中，已经涌现出并正在继续涌现出很多的积极分子和工作干部，我们的责任，就在于组织他们，培养他们，使他们在工作中不断地得到进步。现在，党中央又教导我们广大干部，要努力学习，认真思考，在几年之内将自己的政治、理论和业务水平大大地提高一步。我们党的基层干部和所有的干部一样，都是在党中央和毛泽东同志的亲切关怀下成长壮大起来的。
    安徽党的组织遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，历年来，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，在培养提高基层干部方面，做了许多工作，培养训练了大批基层干部。广大基层干部经过党的长期教育以及实际斗争和生产劳动的锻炼，在政治觉悟、工作能力和文化科学技术知识等方面都有了很大的提高。他们干劲大、热情高，具有革命的雄心大志和踏踏实实的工作作风，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，做了大量的工作，起了巨大的作用。
    根据几年来的实践，我们体会到，要做好培养提高基层干部的工作，首先各级党组织必须从思想上予以足够的重视。这是做好这一工作的重要关键。安徽各级党的组织对培养提高基层干部一向是重视的，但也有些同志对此认识不足，重视不够。一种是把培养提高基层干部同完成工作任务对立起来，他们认为，“生产、工作忙，没有时间培养”，甚至认为生产和工作是“硬任务”，完不成不行，培养提高干部是“软任务”，搞不好没关系。另一种是强调困难，对办党校和各种干校，强调没有教员，没有教材，没有经费，没有设备，不好办；对基层干部的学习问题，采取消极态度，认为他们文化低，学不了，学不好。还有一种是，认为培养干部和其他工作不一样，是“百年树人”，非一日之功，只能慢慢来。所有这些思想，虽然表现形式不同，但归根结底是对培养提高基层干部的重要意义认识不足。他们不了解，基层干部政治思想水平的高低，业务工作能力的强弱，对能否做好基层工作有直接的关系。因此，对基层干部使用多、教育少，要求高、帮助少。为了解决这些思想问题，我们一方面在各种会议上，在报纸刊物上，大力宣传培养提高基层干部的重要意义；另一方面针对各种错误思想，开展鸣放辩论；同时作出样子，树立标兵，用事实进行教育。通过这些办法，提高了认识，克服了错误思想，从而使培养提高基层干部的工作能够顺利进行。事实证明，凡是这样做了的地方，培养提高基层干部的工作就收到了显著的成效。例如，宣城县先进公社开始办党校时，有些大队的领导干部怕影响生产，不让党员干部到党校学习。公社党委除对这些错误思想进行批评教育外，并积极办好党校，提高了干部，搞好了工作，使大家认识到抽调党员干部到党校学习，不仅不影响生产，而且推动了生产。由于大家提高了认识，因而积极要求调党员干部到党校学习。灵璧县高楼公社开始办业余学校时，有些干部借口生产忙，困难多，无办法。经过鸣放辩论提高了认识，统一了思想，解决了问题，找到了办法，迅速地形成大办各种业余学校的高潮。
    我们培养提高基层干部的要求，是根据党的“又红又专”、“红透专深”的干部工作方针，结合基层干部的具体情况和各个时期党的政治任务来确定的。主要是以马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想教育和武装干部，从政治上、思想上、作风上开展两条道路、两条路线、两种方法的教育，使广大基层干部具有高度的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，坚定的无产阶级立场；坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和党的各项方针、政策，向一切违背总路线的思想行为进行斗争；更好地发扬群众路线的优良传统，不断地改进工作方法，密切联系群众，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，既有雄心壮志，又要踏实苦干。同时，还要组织基层干部积极钻研业务，努力学习文化、科学技术，不断提高业务、文化、科学技术水平。
    我们培养提高基层干部，采取了多种多样的方法，概括起来，主要是：做、训、学、整四个字。
      “做”，就是在实际工作中培养提高基层干部。这是培养提高基层干部的一个重要方面。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”（《中国革命战争的战略问题》）“干部和农民在自己的斗争经验中将改造他们自己。要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生。”（《关于农业合作化问题》）实践证明，广大基层干部，都是经过实际工作和各种运动的锻炼，逐步成长起来的。例如，在1958年大办钢铁运动中，他们经过这个运动的锻炼，改造了思想，提高了觉悟，学习了技术，达到既炼钢又炼人的目的。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，广大基层干部树雄心、立大志，大搞工具改革，猛攻科学技术堡垒，既推动运动的开展，又锻炼提高了自己。他们当中的许多人，现在已经成为出色的“土专家”、工程师和技术员。
    我们在实际工作中培养提高基层干部，首先，坚持了政治挂帅，虚实并举。在开会讨论工作的时候，既研究解决工作中的实际问题，又研究党的方针、政策。布置工作的时候，既交代任务，又交代政策、方法。检查工作的时候，既检查任务的完成情况，又检查政策的执行情况。同时，还引导和帮助他们经常地总结工作，吸取经验教训，提高思想水平，改进工作方法。省委和各县委、公社党委每年定期召开六级、五级、四级、三级干部会议。参加这些会议的多数是基层干部。他们通过这些会议，学习了理论和党的方针政策，提高了思想水平和政策水平，总结了经验，明确了任务，改进了作风。经验证明，这些会议由于领导强，内容丰富，解决问题深透，因而是培养提高基层干部的极为重要的方法之一。
    其次，对基层干部的使用，一方面在政策原则上要抓得紧，便于统一认识，统一行动，保证党的政策原则的贯彻执行；另一方面，在实际工作中大胆放手地让他们去做，使他们敢于负责，能够主动地把党的政策原则与当地的实际情况结合起来，积极完成党的各项任务，培养提高他们的独立工作能力。
    再次，组织基层干部种好试验田，参加生产、领导生产。这是使基层干部走向又红又专的一条有效途径。安徽省委对此极为重视。早在1953年，省委第一书记就提倡并亲自种了试验田。在省委的倡议和带动下，全省各级党的组织和领导干部，以及广大基层干部都逐步地、普遍地搞了试验田。同时，广大基层干部还按照省委规定的时间和要求，与群众一起参加生产劳动。事实证明，基层干部参加生产劳动、种试验田，不仅能进一步深入群众，深入实际，密切干部和群众的关系，改善工作作风，而且还能及时发现问题、解决问题，增加自己的生产知识，更好地领导生产。
    “训”，就是办好党校和各种专业干部学校，有计划地轮训基层干部。党校和专业干部学校是较集中地、系统地培养提高基层干部的重要场所。现在，安徽省以基层干部为主要训练对象的学校，有地、市、县委党校七十余所，专业干部学校近百所；基层党校五千余所。两年来共训练基层干部三百多万人次。经过训练的基层干部，政治觉悟、政策水平、文化科学知识和业务工作能力都迅速地提高了。他们说：“学习真正好，如得三件宝，觉悟能提高，文化能学到，生产技术、领导办法全有了。”
    我们训练基层干部的内容，是根据党的政治任务和中心工作来确定的。例如：1958年，主要是学习党的社会主义建设总路线和党中央《关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议》。1959年上半年，主要是学习党的八届六中全会《关于人民公社若干问题的决议》，1959年下半年主要是学习党的八届八中全会的决议。这样就使党校和专业干部学校的训练工作，更好地为党的政治任务和中心工作的需要服务。
    党校训练的形式，是灵活多样的。县委党校和公社党校，根据农业生产季节、工作需要和训练对象，采取集中训练和就地训练相结合的办法。在一般情况下，集中在党校训练；在生产比较忙的季节，到基层就地训练。就地训练的形式，一般有两种，一种是到生产和工作比较先进的地方，结合现场参观，总结交流经验，培养训练干部；一种是到工作比较差的地方，一面训练，一面帮助工作，把训练干部和改造落后地区结合起来。在训练的时间安排上，一般的是冬春多训，夏秋少训；农事间隙时多训练领导骨干，农忙时多训练专业人员。这样既有效地解决了训练和工作、生产的矛盾，保证党校能够按计划坚持训练，又使训练和工作、生产能够更好地紧密结合，互相推动。
    “学”，就是大办业余教育，组织基层干部参加业余学习。业余学校是组织广大基层干部学习政治、文化和科学技术的重要形式。全省所有的厂矿企业、人民公社都办起了业余的红专学校、技术学校、文化学校。这些业余学校，有的是一个单位办的，有的是几个单位联合办的；有的是按部门办的，有的是按系统办的。有些不仅办了初等中等的业余学校，而且办了高等业余学校。有些单位还形成了从小学到大学的“一条龙”的业余教育体系。在教学内容上，既有政治课，又有文化科学技术课；既学基础知识，又学专业知识；既注意当前的迫切需要，又注意系统的提高。经验证明，要搞好业余学习，必须妥善解决学习和生产、工作的矛盾。这个问题不解决，业余学习就很难坚持下来。为了解决这个问题，各地除对基层干部加强教育，提高他们学习的自觉性和主动性外，还采取了以下办法：（一）在学习内容上，贯彻做什么学什么的方针，使工作学习拧成一股绳；（二）妥善安排工作和学习的时间，改善工作方法；（三）建立和健全必要的制度，并定期检查督促。同时，还为公社、厂矿企业配备和培养了大批的兼职和专职的教学人员。这是巩固业余学习的重要条件。通过业余学校学习，广大基层干部的政治、文化和科学技术水平大大提高了。例如涡阳县张村公社的社队干部从1958年以来，一直坚持学习毛主席的著作，现在已经学完《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等三十多篇。他们通过学习，对建设社会主义事业更加信心百倍，意气风发，普遍反映说：“毛主席著作像灯塔，越学心里越亮堂，思想解放干劲足，万重困难一扫光。”蚌埠染织厂，八年如一日地坚持职工业余教育，逐步建立了从小学到大学的一套完整的职工业余教育体系。1952年，全厂职工中，文盲占60％以上，具有初中程度的人仅占7％，高中、大学程度的人一个没有；现在已有95％以上的职工达到高小以上的文化水平，其中初中以上的占70％，大学占7％。并通过业余教育培养了技术干部和工业管理干部一百六十余人，三级以上技工四百七十余人，不仅满足了本厂对技术干部和技术工人的需要，而且还抽出六十余名干部和一百多名三级以上技工支援了兄弟厂。各地除了普遍地举办业余学校以外，还采取按照生产或工作单位编成学习小组，安排有阅读能力的基层干部自学，定期或不定期举行报告会等办法，组织基层干部进行业余学习，都收到了良好的效果。
    “整”，就是整风。整风是培养提高基层干部的一种最有效的方法。安徽的历次整风运动，特别是1957年和1959年两次整风运动，都收到了巨大效果。广大基层干部大大提高了政治思想觉悟，明确了政治方向，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，发扬了党的群众路线和实事求是的工作作风，密切了党和群众、干部和群众的关系。
    整顿基层干部思想作风的做法，首先是通过开会作报告、组织学习文件，进行正面教育，提高认识，端正态度；继而采取群众路线的方法，发动鸣放辩论，开展批评与自我批评，把思想作风上存在的问题充分地暴露出来；然后，针对这些问题，进行系统的教育提高。同时，还运用了回忆、对比和展览等方法，教育提高基层干部。如1959年整风运动中，全省各公社、各大队，普遍举办了“三个十年”对比展览会，对广大基层干部的教育极为深刻。
    在整风中，坚持了教育提高的方针。对基层干部思想作风上存在的问题，都根据“团结—批评—团结”，“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，既满腔热忱地帮助他们改正缺点错误，又保护和发扬他们的积极性。
    加强党的领导，是做好培养提高基层干部工作的根本保证。县委和公社党委是基层干部的直接领导者，对基层干部接触较多，比较熟悉，因而他们对培养提高基层干部负有重大的责任。几年来，安徽省各县委和公社党委对培养提高基层干部的工作是重视的。他们都把这一工作列入了重要议事日程，并确定一名书记挂帅，经常研究问题，及时督促、检查，不断总结交流经验。在党委统一领导下，组织、宣传部门和各有关部门也都把这一工作列为一项经常的重要任务，加强具体指导，及时解决各种思想问题和实际问题，具体安排工作、学习和劳动的时间，建立和健全了各种制度，从而保证了培养提高基层干部的工作经常化和制度化。同时，各地、县委还为公社和厂矿企业等基层单位配备和培养了大批理论、文化教学人员。这对加强基层干部教育起了很大作用。
    下放干部和下去到基层帮助工作的干部，是培养提高基层干部工作中的一支重要力量。大跃进以来，全省县以上机关抽调了大批干部下放到基层担任领导职务，不仅加强了基层工作，而且对培养提高基层干部起了重要作用。县以上机关下放到基层劳动锻炼和基层工作锻炼，以及到基层帮助工作的干部，一面参加劳动，锻炼自己，一面帮助基层干部做好工作，学习政治理论和文化科学知识。例如阜阳专区自1959年以来，先后下放大批干部到生产队进行劳动锻炼和基层锻炼。他们不仅帮助这些队作好了工作，锻炼提高了自己，而且培养了基层干部和积极分子一千余人。又如五河县原来工作比较落后，经过派出大批的得力干部坐点包干，充分发动群众，培养和选拔了大批的优秀基层干部，迅速地改变了面貌。
    几年来，安徽省培养提高基层干部的工作虽然取得了一定的成绩和经验，但是，这同形势发展的需要比起来，还是不够的。现在，我们正进一步加强这方面的工作，更好更快地提高广大基层干部的水平，保证社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的需要。
