Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch. TASS, Moscow, 5th dispatch: On July 5th, the Soviet Union launched a rocket into the Pacific Ocean region. This marks the beginning of testing a new type of powerful multi-stage carrier rocket for space exploration.

TASS issued a communique regarding this. The full text of the communique is as follows:

As previously announced, from July 5th to 31st, 1960, the Soviet Union will conduct tests of a new type of powerful multi-stage carrier rocket for space exploration.

According to the pre-arranged plan, one of these rockets was launched on July 5th. The rocket lifted off accurately at the specified time and operated strictly according to the predetermined plan.

The model of the rocket's final stage, suitable for passing through the dense atmosphere, reached the water's surface very close to the planned landing point, approximately 13,000 kilometers from the launch site.

Soviet special vessels equipped with various measuring instruments, stationed in the central Pacific region, completed all the planned measurements and obtained valuable results.

In order to further accumulate experimental data, tests of some powerful ballistic rockets will continue. These rockets will land within the area announced in the TASS communique of June 29th.

    准确在规定时间内起飞　严格按照预定计划运行
    苏联向太平洋发射强大火箭成功
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联5日向太平洋地区发射了一个火箭。这是试验用于宇宙考察的新型威力强大的多级运载火箭的开始。
    塔斯社为此发表了公报。公报全文如下：
    前已公布，自1960年7月5日至31日，苏联将进行供宇宙考察之用的新型威力强大的多级运载火箭的试验。
    按照预定的计划，于7月5日发射了这种火箭中的一个。火箭准确地在规定的时间内起飞，严格地按照预定计划运行。
    适于通过浓密大气层的火箭最后一级的模型，达到了紧紧靠近预定降落点附近的水面，距起飞地点约一万三千公里。
    停泊在太平洋中部区域的装有各种测量仪器的苏联专用船只，完成了全部预定的测量计划，并获得了宝贵的结果。
    为了进一步积累试验资料，将继续试验一些威力强大的弹道火箭。这些火箭将降落在塔斯社6月29日的公报中所宣布的区域范围内。
