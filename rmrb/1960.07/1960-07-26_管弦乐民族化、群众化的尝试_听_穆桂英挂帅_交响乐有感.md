An Attempt to Nationalize and Popularize Orchestral Music
— Thoughts on Listening to the Symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command"
Zhao Feng

Since the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's orchestral music creation has achieved great development and success. Many orchestral works have portrayed the themes of revolutionary historical struggles and reflected the spirited mental outlook of the Chinese people during the Great Leap Forward. In particular, some orchestral works created by young students of music academies, such as Liu Shikun's "Youth Piano Concerto" and He Zhanhao's "Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto," have made valuable attempts in the nationalization and popularization of orchestral music and have achieved certain successes.

We believe that nationalization and popularization are both different and related. Otherwise, the pursuit of national forms can only be an experiment by a few musicians in their studios. The path taken by some bourgeois musicians since the May Fourth Movement is precisely such a path. Because they believe that so-called national characteristics are only a matter of form and technique, they often lead the pursuit of national forms to the deviation of novelty-seeking tastes and so-called "decorative techniques and colors."

Recently, we listened to the symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command," collectively created by the amateur creation group of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra. This work, which has won the appreciation of the broad masses, has achieved some gratifying results in the nationalization and popularization of orchestral music.

This work portrays a moving image of an ancient female patriot. Mu Guiying's heroic voice of "If I don't take command, who will?" is the voice of a patriot that has long lived in the hearts of the Chinese people. This symphony narrates this story through a series of dramatic scenes, portraying this heroine's conflicting feelings between national hatred and personal grudges. What is commendable is that all of this is expressed in forms, colors, and techniques that are popular with the masses, and therefore has distinct national characteristics and strong artistic appeal.

In the past, the national form of many people's music creation was limited to the scope of musical language and polyphonic writing methods (harmony and counterpoint). It seemed that important musical expression means such as musical structure and expression techniques, the accumulated experience of Western European musical practice was already perfect and an insurmountable paradigm. Therefore, as long as some effort was put into the musical language, the form was naturally a sonata allegro, and the expression technique was the principle of thematic development and contrast, this was already a national form. However, the national form should be the entirety of various elements of musical expression such as tone, language, harmony, counterpoint, rhythm, form, and technique. The national form, rooted in the common life and common national psychological qualities and aesthetic habits of the nation, must be built on the basis of the comprehensive common characteristics of various elements of music - melody, material, polyphonic writing methods, principles of musical structure, and commonly used expression techniques. Form and technique can only be a historical category. It is impossible to imagine a perfect and supreme form and genre. If this were the case, musical art would definitely stagnate. Different nations inevitably have different musical languages, and they also inevitably have different principles of musical structure and commonly used expression techniques. The reason why the symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command" has been successful is that its authors do not regard the national form as merely a matter of pure musical language, but adopt the multi-sectional structure of Chinese classical music in terms of musical structure principles, and adopt the sound-picture-like modeling expression method commonly used in Chinese national music in terms of expression techniques. This is the fundamental reason for the success of this work and some previous works such as "Youth Piano Concerto" and "Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto." The "Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto" successfully uses the structural principle of the Chinese opera's 'ban qiang ti' (clapper opera); the "Youth Piano Concerto" does not limit itself to the framework of Western European concerto form; the symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command" has achieved the same achievements in this regard.

Some people also oppose the musical works played by orchestras composed of mixed Chinese and Western musical instruments (such as "Festival Overture"), saying that the mixed arrangement of musical instruments with different timbres and scales is very disharmonious. Of course, this approach raises some new issues in orchestration. The problem is to gradually solve it in continuous practice. At present, some musical instruments should and have been reformed as necessary and appropriate in terms of production. However, we believe that it is precisely in order to express the spirited mental outlook of the Chinese people and the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses that we must use this mixed orchestra, and we must gradually create standardized new types of orchestra arrangements, and only in this way can we adapt to the aesthetic habits and common hobbies that have grown on the basis of the Chinese people's musical life practice for thousands of years. If the symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command" does not use Chinese percussion instruments, it would also not be able to achieve such a strong and moving effect and such a strong and distinct style.

More importantly, the experience of these successful works tells us that in the work of exploring national forms, we should never rigidly apply the existing experience of Western European music practice. Of course, we do not advocate closing ourselves off. Chairman Mao has long told us to learn from all ancient and foreign outstanding cultural heritages as nourishment for our creation of new musical culture. However, mechanically transplanting is different from true learning and creation. That can only be a hopeless imitation. Only by studying and exploring the laws of national forms from national music itself can we thoroughly solve the major issue of "nationalization."

Of course, it should also be pointed out that the symphony "Mu Guiying Takes Command" also has its shortcomings, but I don't think it is a kind of shortcomings such as insufficient symphony or lack of sufficient contrast in structure. It can even be said that in the symphony processing techniques, this work also has obvious advantages in some places compared to similar works. I think the shortcomings lie in the fact that not enough effort has been put into portraying the inner activities of this legendary heroine - the heroic and complex emotion of "If I don't take command, who will?", and more emphasis has been placed on the description of some "scenes." I firmly believe that this work, after continuous performance and processing, will surely become an excellent repertoire of China's orchestral music creation.

    管弦乐民族化、群众化的尝试
    ——听“穆桂英挂帅”交响乐有感
    赵沨
    建国十周年以来，我国管弦乐创作取得了巨大的发展和成绩，许多管弦乐作品表现了革命历史斗争的题材，反映了大跃进中的中国人民意气风发的精神面貌。特别是一些音乐院校的青年学生创作的一些管弦乐作品，如刘诗昆等的《青年钢琴协奏曲》和何占豪的《梁祝小提琴协奏曲》等，在管弦乐的民族化和群众化方面，作了可贵的尝试，并取得一定的成绩。
    我们认为，民族化和群众化是既有区别又有联系的，否则，民族形式的追求只可能是少数音乐家在书斋中的实验而已。“五四”以来有些资产阶级音乐家所走的道路，正是这样的道路。因为，他们认为所谓民族特点只不过是形式和技术的问题，所以，往往把民族形式的追求引向猎奇的趣味和所谓“手法、色彩的装饰”的歧途上去了。
    最近，我们听到了中央乐团管弦乐队业余创作小组集体创作的《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐，这个获得广大群众赞赏的作品在管弦乐的民族化和群众化方面，有一些可喜的收获。
    这个作品刻划了一个动人的古代女爱国者的形象，穆桂英的“我不挂帅谁挂帅”的豪迈的声音，是长远活在我国人民心底的爱国者的声音。这个交响乐以一系列的戏剧场面叙述了这个故事，刻划了这个女英雄在国仇和私恨之间的矛盾心情；可贵的是，这一切都是用群众所喜闻乐见的形式、色彩、手法来表现的，因而具有鲜明的民族特点和强烈的艺术感染力量。
    过去，不少人的音乐创作的民族形式仅仅局限在音乐语言和多声部写作方法（和声和复调）的范围之内，好像诸如曲体结构和表现手法这样重要的音乐表现手段，西欧的音乐实践的经验积累已经是完美无缺，而且是不可超越的典范了。因而，只要在音乐语言方面下些功夫，曲体当然是奏鸣曲快板，表现手法则是主题展开和对比的原则，这已经就是民族形式了。但是，民族形式应是音调、语言、和声、复调、节奏、曲体、手法等音乐表现各项要素的总体，根源于民族共同生活和共同的民族心理素质和审美习惯的民族形式，必定是建筑在音乐的各项要素——曲调、素材、多声部写作方法、曲体结构原则和惯用表现手法等综合的共同特征的基础之上的。曲体和手法也只可能是一个历史的范畴，不可能设想有一种完美无缺和至高无上的形式和体裁，如果真是这样，音乐艺术就一定停滞不前了。不同的民族必然有着不同的音乐语言，也必然有着不同的曲体结构原则和惯用的表现手法。《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐之所以获得成功，正是它的作者们不把民族形式仅仅看作是单纯的音乐语言的问题，而在曲体结构原则上采用了我国古典音乐的多段体结构，在表现手法上采用我国民族音乐惯用的音画式的造型性表现方法，这是这个作品以及在前的一些作品如《青年钢琴协奏曲》、《梁祝小提琴协奏曲》等作品获得成功的根本原因。《梁祝小提琴协奏曲》成功地运用了中国戏曲的板腔体的结构原则；《青年钢琴协奏曲》也不为西欧的协奏曲形式的框框把自己限制起来；《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐在这一方面获得了同样的成就。
    也有人反对用中西乐器混合编成的乐队演奏的音乐作品（如《节日序曲》），说甚么不同音色和乐律的乐器混合编成很不谐和。当然，这种做法在配器法上提出了一些新的课题，问题是要在不断的实践中去逐步解决它；目前，有些乐器在制作上应该并且已经进行了必要和适当的改革。但是，我们认为，正是为了要表现中国人民意气风发的精神面貌和广大群众的冲天干劲，才要求我们必须使用这种混合编成的乐队，并且要求我们逐步创造出新型的乐队编成的规范的，而且也只有这样，才能适应基础于中国人民千百年来在音乐生活实践中成长的审美习惯和共同爱好。《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐如果不使用中国打击乐器，也是同样不能获得如此强烈感人的效果和如此强烈鲜明的风格的。
    更重要的是，这些成功的作品的经验告诉我们，在探索民族形式的工作中，绝不应该是生硬地套用西欧音乐实践的现成的经验。当然，我们不主张闭关自守，毛主席早就告诉我们要借鉴一切古代和外国的优秀文化遗产，来作为我们创造新的音乐文化的养料。但是，机械地搬用不同于真正的借鉴和创造，那只能是没有出息的模仿；只有从民族音乐的本身来研究、探索有关民族形式的规律，才有可能彻底地解决“民族化”这个重大的课题。
    当然，也应指出，《穆桂英挂帅》交响乐这个作品，也还有其不足之处，但我不认为是甚么交响性不够、结构上缺乏充分的对比等等一类的缺点，甚至于可以说，在交响性处理的手法上，这个作品在某些地方还比同类的作品还有其明显的优点。我认为，不足之处是在于刻划这位传奇的女英雄的内心活动——“我不挂帅谁挂帅”这个豪迈而复杂的情绪上用力不足，笔墨较多地用到了对于一些“场面”的描写上了。我深信，这个作品经过不断的演出和加工，一定可以成为我国管弦乐创作的一个优秀的保留曲目的。
