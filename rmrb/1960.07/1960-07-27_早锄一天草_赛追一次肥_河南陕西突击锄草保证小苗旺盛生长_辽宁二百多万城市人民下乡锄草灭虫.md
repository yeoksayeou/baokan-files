Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 25th. Henan is emulating the spirit of combating drought and rushing to plant, by launching a crash campaign to eliminate weeds in autumn fields. As of the 18th, 53% of the province's late autumn crops have been cultivated once, with over 15,170,000 mu of weed infestation eliminated, accounting for over 96% of the existing weed infestation area.

Henan Province has exceeded its summer planting plan by 2%. Currently, various localities are seizing the opportunity to preserve soil moisture and expand planting as much as possible. However, because most late autumn crops were planted hastily to combat drought, many cultivated lands were not harrowed to loosen the soil or plowed to remove stubble before sowing. After recent rains, there was a rapid growth of weeds and soil compaction. In order to eliminate weeds promptly and ensure vigorous seedling growth, various localities are actively responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and launching a crash weeding campaign to eliminate weed infestation. In the Xinyang Special District, 1,420,000 laborers are mobilized daily for cultivating and summer weeding, with the daily progress of weeding alone reaching 384,000 mu. In the Xinxiang Special District, the labor force participating in weeding accounts for 53% of the agricultural frontline labor force in the entire district. Among the 139 communes in the district, 97 have reached the standard of no weeds in autumn fields.

Leading cadres at all levels have gone to the frontline to participate in and lead summer weeding. In Shangshui County, Xuchang Special District, 6,100 county, commune, and team cadres and masses are fighting together in the fields, launching a crash campaign of cultivating and weeding.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 25th. Shaanxi is concentrating superior forces and combining efforts with drought resistance to launch a crash weeding campaign to protect seedlings. As of the 19th, 61.6% of the province's autumn fields have been weeded, with 24.2% weeded twice.

Since July 5th, some areas of Shaanxi have successively received thunderstorms and light rain. However, the drought situation has not been alleviated, but rather has promoted weed growth, leading to a phenomenon of weak seedlings and vigorous weeds in many autumn fields. In addition, during the summer harvest this year, wheat grains were scattered by the wind, resulting in the proliferation of "wheat seedlings" in some summer-sown crop fields. Therefore, launching a crash weeding campaign to eliminate weed infestation has become an important issue in current autumn field management. Various localities have adopted emergency measures, organized labor, and launched a crash summer weeding campaign. In Zhouzhi County, nine communes immediately convened mobilization meetings for weeding and eliminating weed infestation after the rain. The county organized 100,000 laborers to launch a crash weeding campaign, and the county's 1,050,000 mu of autumn-harvest grain crops and cotton have generally been weeded one to three times. In the Yan'an Special District, over 87% of the special district, county, and commune-level cadres have gone deep into the fields, weeding autumn fields together with commune members and guiding production.

In the crash weeding and seedling protection campaign, various localities have paid attention to combining efforts with topdressing, checking seedlings for replenishment, and preventing pests. As of the 19th, over 6,200,000 mu of autumn fields in the province have been topdressed once, over 3,330,000 mu have been checked and seedlings replenished, and comprehensive prevention and control measures have been taken for 550,000 mu of autumn fields with pest damage, thereby ensuring the healthy growth of seedlings.

This newspaper reports that the people of Liaoning's cities are supporting agriculture in an unprecedented new upsurge. A support army of 2,050,000 people is assisting nearby rural areas in a crash campaign to weed after the rain, control pests, and rush to plant autumn vegetables.

Since the beginning of summer, Liaoning has experienced continuous rainfall, resulting in a serious phenomenon of rapid weed growth and pest infestation in large areas of farmland. In order to eliminate pests before their voracious feeding period, completely eliminate weed infestation, promptly topdress, and sow autumn vegetables, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an emergency meeting on July 10th and issued an emergency directive, mobilizing urban agencies, enterprises, schools, and organizations to temporarily suspend work that can be suspended, extract over two-thirds of the labor force to go to the countryside, and fully participate in the struggle to eliminate weed infestation, eliminate pests, topdress, and plant vegetables in rural areas. The local army also enthusiastically and fully supports this effort.

The Provincial Party Committee's call quickly formed a nationwide movement to support agriculture. Colonel Zheng Ping of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army led more than 7,000 officers and soldiers, fighting on both sides of the Dadu River, using the heroic spirit of participating in the Jinzhou Campaign to eliminate Kuomintang bandit troops, to help communes weed and rescue seedlings, rushing to weed more than 6,000 mu every day. Xiao Chun, First Secretary of the Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee, and the First Secretaries of the seven counties under the city, went deep into the fields, conducted practical inspections, and found that manpower was insufficient in severely affected areas. They quickly adopted measures such as reducing sideline production and streamlining non-production personnel to strengthen the main attack force, increasing the number of people eliminating weed infestation and pests from 400,000 per day in late June to 600,000. Because leading cadres go to the frontline, promptly discover problems, and solve problems, pest elimination and other work have achieved great results. Under the slogan "Eliminating pests is like putting out a fire, protecting seedlings to seize a bumper harvest," Dalian City mobilized over 100,000 troops every day and has eliminated the most harmful cutworms before their voracious feeding period.

    早锄一天草　赛追一次肥
    河南陕西突击锄草保证小苗旺盛生长
    辽宁二百多万城市人民下乡锄草灭虫
    新华社郑州25日电　河南各地在秋田管理中，以抗旱抢种的劲头，突击消灭草荒。到18日为止，全省已有53％的晚秋作物中耕一遍，其中消灭草荒一千五百一十七万多亩，占现有草荒面积96％以上。
    河南省已超额2％完成了夏播计划。目前各地还在趁时抢墒，尽量扩种。但是由于大部分晚秋作物是抗旱抢种的，播种时不少耕地没有来得及耙耱松土、耕犁灭茬，最近得雨之后，一时出现了草苗竞长、土地板结的情况。为了及时消灭杂草，保证小苗旺盛生长，各地都积极响应省委的号召，突击除草灭荒。信阳专区每天出动一百四十二万名劳力进行中耕夏锄，光拔草日进度就达到三十八万四千亩。新乡专区参加除草的劳力占全区农业第一线上的劳力的53％。全区一百三十九个公社中，已有九十七个达到了秋田无杂草的标准。
    各地领导干部都到第一线，参加夏锄领导夏锄。许昌专区商水县有六千一百名县、社、队干部和群众共同奋战田间，突击中耕除草。
    新华社西安25日电　陕西各地正在集中优势力量，结合抗旱，突击锄草保苗。到19日止，全省已锄秋田61.6％，其中有24.2％锄了两次。
    7月5日以来，陕西部分地区相继降了雷阵小雨。但是旱象并未解除，相反助长了杂草生长，不少秋田发生苗弱草旺现象；加上今年在夏收中，小麦遇风落粒，有些夏播作物地“麦青”丛生。因此，突击锄草灭荒，已成为当前秋田管理中的一个重要问题。各地都采取紧急措施，组织劳力，突击夏锄。盩厔县九个公社在雨后立即召开了锄草灭荒誓师大会，全县组织了十万劳力突击锄草，全县一百零五万亩秋收粮食作物和棉花，已普遍锄完了一至三次。延安专区87％以上的专区、县、社三级干部，深入田间，和广大社员一起锄秋，指导生产。
    各地在突击除草保苗运动中，都注意结合进行追肥、查苗补苗和防虫。到19日，全省已有六百二十多万亩秋田普追了一遍肥，查补苗三百三十三万多亩，并对五十五万亩有虫害的秋田进行了全面防治，从而保证幼苗健壮生长。
    本报讯　辽宁各城市人民支援农业出现空前的新高潮。由二百零五万人组成的支援大军，正协助附近农村突击抢锄雨后草荒、治虫和抢种秋菜。
    入夏以来，辽宁地区雨水连绵，大片农田出现严重的草苗竞长、虫害丛生的现象。为了把虫害聚歼在暴食期之前，彻底消灭草荒现象，及时追肥和播种秋菜，中共辽宁省委在7月10日召开了紧急会议，发出紧急指示，动员城市各机关、企业、学校、团体，把暂时可停的工作停一下，抽出三分之二以上的劳动力下乡，全力投入支援农村灭草荒、灭虫、追肥、种菜的斗争。各地驻军也热烈地全力支援。
    省委号召很快地形成了一个支援农业的全民运动。解放军某部郑屏上校率领的七千多官兵，战斗在大渡河两岸，以当年参加锦州战役消灭国民党匪军的英雄气概，帮助公社铲草救苗，每天抢锄六千多亩。中共锦州市委第一书记萧纯和市属七个县的县委第一书记，都深入田间，实查实看，发现灾害严重地带人力不足，便迅速采取了减少副业生产和精简非生产人员等措施，加强了主攻力量，使消灭草荒虫害的人数，由6月下旬的每天四十万人，逐渐增加到了六十万人。由于领导干部上第一线，及时发现问题，解决问题，灭虫等工作已获得很大战果。旅大市在“灭虫如灭火，保苗夺丰收”的口号下，每天出动十多万大军，已将危害最大的夜盗虫消灭在暴食期以前。
