Party Secretary's Notes

    Living Rich Days as Poor Days
    Yang Tianzhi, Secretary of the CPC Wusheng Central District Committee, Sichuan

    "In the past, after finishing work and returning home, I first had to fetch water and then gather firewood. Others did a whole hillside of work, while I was still stuck at home. Now, after finishing work, there's no need to rush. I happily go to the canteen. As long as the work gong sounds, I can work without any worries." This Wusheng folk song vividly reflects the inseparable feelings of the masses towards the public canteen.

    Production and life are inseparable. If production is good but living arrangements are poor, the masses will always have complaints. Arranging the lives of the masses well can further inspire their enthusiasm and promote sustained leaps in production. The Satellite Management District of the Jiuxian Commune used to have good production, but the living arrangements were not satisfactory. The district committee pointed this out to them, mobilized the masses to discuss how to run the public canteen well, and they focused on the seven key areas of "grain, vegetables, money, firewood, illness, care (for the old, young, sick, weak, and pregnant women), and pigs." They made careful calculations and arranged life well. The masses were very satisfied and had even greater enthusiasm. Now, the production in this management district is outstanding.

    Running the canteen well is a requirement for production development and is in line with the continuous leap forward situation. After the people's communes were established, the degree of collectivization of production became higher, and the degree of collectivization of life also increased accordingly. The masses no longer live in single-family households as in the past, but take the commune as their home and rely on the collective. The canteen also organizes some of the weaker laborers to engage in sideline production, such as making straw sandals, weaving straw hats, and even making aromatic oil, which increases the canteen's income and frees up the labor force of the specialized teams to be put into the front line of production. In this way, the content of the public canteen has been greatly enriched.

    In running the canteen, the masses showed a sense of ownership, and everyone cared about and supported the canteen. The Wusi Canteen in the Diversified Management District of the Longmen Commune, after the spring harvest this year, the commune members, after discussion, carefully calculated the grain accounts and decided to live rich days as poor days. Eat more during busy farming seasons, eat less during slack seasons, eat more on sunny days, eat less on rainy days, eat more for strong laborers, and eat less for weak laborers. In addition, they made careful calculations, mixed grain and vegetables, and matched coarse and fine grains. They calculated before eating. Because of such careful arrangements, their lives are lived well and economically.

    With good production and good living arrangements, the enthusiasm of the masses is high, and their mental outlook is constantly changing. The relationship between people is also constantly changing. The cooks take meticulous care of the commune members' lives, providing tea and boiling water, and are very attentive. The commune members are the same, doing their best to help the cooks run the canteen well, either carrying a load of water for the canteen, or picking up firewood for the canteen when they return from work. Everyone for me, and me for everyone, has become a new fashion in the lives of the commune members.

    富日子当穷日子过
    中共四川武胜中心区区委书记  杨天志
    “往日收工回家转，先挑水来后拿柴，别人做活一大坡，我还在家出不来；如今收工不要忙，欢欢喜喜进食堂，只要出工锣鼓响，无忧无挂把工上。”这首武胜民歌生动地反映了群众和公共食堂不可或离的感情。
    生产和生活是不能分的，生产搞得好，生活安排得不好，群众总是有意见的。安排好群众的生活，就可以进一步鼓舞群众的干劲，促使生产持续跃进。旧县公社卫星管区原来生产抓得好，生活安排得不尽如人意。区委向他们指出了这一点，发动群众讨论如何办好公共食堂，他们就抓好“粮、菜、钱、柴、病、照（照顾老幼病弱和孕产妇）、猪”等七个字，精打细算，安排生活，群众都很满意，干劲更大。现在，这个管区的生产搞得非常出色。
    办好食堂，这是生产发展的要求。也是同持续跃进的形势相适应的。人民公社化以后，生产的集体化程度更高了，生活的集体化程度也随之日益增长，群众不再像过去那样单家独户过日子，而是以社为家，靠集体过日子。食堂还组织一部分弱劳力搞副业生产，如打草鞋、编草帽，甚至制芳香油等，既增加食堂收入，又抽出了专业队的劳动力投入生产第一线。这样，公共食堂的内容大大丰富了。　　群众在办食堂中，表现了主人翁的态度，人人关心食堂，支持食堂，龙门公社多种经营管区的五四食堂，今年小春收获后，社员经过讨论，算了粮食的细账，决定把富日子当穷日子过。农忙多吃，农闲少吃，晴天多吃，雨天少吃，劳力强的多吃，劳力弱的少吃。此外，还精打细算，粮菜混吃，粗细搭配，算了再吃。由于这样周密地安排，他们的日子就过得又好又省。
    生产搞得好，生活安排得好，群众的干劲大，精神面貌不断变化，人与人之间的关系也在不断变化。炊事员无微不至地关怀社员的生活，送茶烧水，非常殷勤。社员也是一样，尽自己所能来帮助炊事员搞好食堂，或则替食堂担一挑水，或者收工回来时给食堂捡把柴。人人为我，我为人人，已经成为社员生活中的新风尚了。
