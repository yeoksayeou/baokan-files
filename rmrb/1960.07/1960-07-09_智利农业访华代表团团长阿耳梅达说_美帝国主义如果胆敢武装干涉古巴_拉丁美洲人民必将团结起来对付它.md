Xinhua News Agency, July 8th – Clodomiro Almeida Medina, a leader of the Chilean Socialist Party and head of the Chilean agricultural delegation visiting China, severely condemned U.S. imperialism's reduction of Cuban sugar import quotas when interviewed by reporters from this agency in Beijing on July 7th. He pointed out that this action, aimed at undermining the Cuban economy, is an open intervention in Cuba. U.S. imperialism is using the same tactics it employed against Guatemala in an attempt to economically threaten Cuba.

Almeida fully supports the Cuban government's righteous action of taking over American and British oil companies in Cuba. He said that Cuba did the right thing because American and British oil companies attempted to put pressure on the Cuban government by refusing to refine crude oil belonging to the Cuban government in order to change the policies of the Cuban government.

Almeida said that all Latin American people consider Cuba's cause as their own. A huge anti-imperialist movement is currently unfolding in Latin America, the first priority of which is to support Cuba's struggle against U.S. imperialist intervention. He said that if imperialism disregards everything and dares to intervene in Cuba by force, the people of Latin America will deal with it with a great united action.

Almeida also condemned U.S. imperialism for forcing countries such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia, through the "International Monetary Fund," to accept policies that maintain a colonial economy, causing these countries to abandon plans to develop their own economies and adopt measures such as freezing wages, introducing foreign capital, facilitating the import of American goods, and reducing loans to national industrial and commercial enterprises, thereby making the working class even poorer.

He denounced U.S. imperialism for restricting the import of mineral and agricultural products from Latin American countries through means such as arbitrarily raising tariffs, thereby undermining the policies of Latin American countries to pursue independence, freedom, and the maintenance of dignity.

Almeida said that the working masses of Latin America know that U.S. imperialism is vigorously promoting the above-mentioned anti-people and anti-democratic reactionary policies. This is also the reason for the rising tide of Latin American people's opposition to U.S. imperialism and the increasing development and deepening of the national movement. He said that the Chilean people know that U.S. imperialism's economic oppression policies are the fundamental reason for Chile's economic backwardness; therefore, the people's forces are united around the Chilean People's Action Front, making the anti-imperialist struggle one of their primary tasks.

Almeida also spoke of the deep impression he gained from his visit to China. He said: "What attracted me first and foremost was the rapid development of the Chinese economy, which stands in stark contrast to the situation in other economically underdeveloped countries, proving that China can make the fullest and best use of natural resources and human power."

He said that he was deeply attracted by the Chinese people's close unity around their government, the high political awareness of the Chinese people, the solidarity between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the firm support for the struggles of the peoples in these regions.

Almeida also emphasized that both the people's communes in Chinese cities and rural areas are victorious.

    智利农业访华代表团团长阿耳梅达说
    美帝国主义如果胆敢武装干涉古巴
    拉丁美洲人民必将团结起来对付它
    据新华社8日讯　智利社会党领导人之一、智利农业访华代表团团长克洛多米罗·阿耳梅达·梅迪纳7日在北京接见本社记者时严厉谴责美帝国主义削减古巴食糖进口定额，并且指出，这一旨在打击古巴经济的行动，是对古巴的公开干涉；美帝国主义是在用它对危地马拉采用过的手段，以图从经济上威胁古巴。
    阿耳梅达完全支持古巴政府接管美国和英国在古巴的石油公司这一正义行动。他说，古巴这样做是正确的，因为美国和英国石油公司企图用拒绝炼古巴政府的原油的办法，对古巴政府施加压力，以图改变古巴政府的政策。
    阿耳梅达说，所有拉丁美洲人民认为古巴的事业就是自己的事业。目前一个巨大的反帝运动正在拉丁美洲展开，首先就是要支援古巴反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争。他说，如果帝国主义不顾一切，胆敢用武力来干涉古巴，拉丁美洲的人民就将以巨大的团结行动来对付它。
    阿耳梅达还谴责美帝国主义通过“国际货币基金组织”强迫智利、阿根廷、乌拉圭、玻利维亚等国接受维持殖民地经济的政策，使这些国家放弃发展本国经济的打算，并采取了诸如冻结工资、引进外国资本、便利美国货物进口、减少对民族工商业的贷款等措施，从而使工人阶级更加贫困。
    他指斥美帝国主义以任意提高关税等手段，限制从拉丁美洲各国进口矿产品和农产品，损害了拉丁美洲各国执行独立、自由和维护尊严的政策。
    阿耳梅达说，拉丁美洲劳苦大众知道，是美帝国主义在大力推行上述反人民、反民主的反动政策。这也是当前拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义浪潮高涨，民族运动日益发展、日益深入的原因。他说，智利人民知道，美帝国主义的经济压迫政策，是智利经济落后的根本原因；因此，人民的力量团结在智利人民行动阵线的周围，把反帝斗争作为当前主要任务之一。
    阿耳梅达还谈到他这次访问中国所获得的深刻的印象。他说：“首先吸引我的注意的是中国经济的飞速发展，这同其他经济不发达的国家的情况形成鲜明的对比，这证明中国能对自然资源和人力作最充分的最好的利用。”
    他说，中国人民紧密团结在自己政府的周围，中国人民高度的政治觉悟，中国人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的团结以及对这些地区的人民的斗争的坚决支持等，都深深地吸引了他。
    阿耳梅达还着重指出，无论中国城市和农村的人民公社都是胜利。
