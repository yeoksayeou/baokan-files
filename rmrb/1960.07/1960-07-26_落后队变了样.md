Our practice proves that what we sense, we cannot immediately understand. Only what we understand can we feel more deeply. Sensation only solves the problem of phenomena; theory solves the problem of essence. The solution to these problems cannot be separated from practice. No matter who wants to understand anything, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing.

    The Backward Team Has Changed Its Appearance
    Zhao Fude, Party Branch Secretary of Yuquan Production Team, Lüergou Commune, Tianshui
    Our Tianshui Yuquan Production Team used to be a backward team, but this year it is completely different. The autumn crops were planted faster, better, and more abundantly than in any previous year. In just over twenty days, we sowed 870 mu, accounting for more than 95% of the planned area.

    What is the reason for this change? The most important reason is that we went deep into reality and solved the problems in production. For example, in order to ensure timeliness and quality in sowing, we convened a meeting of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to analyze this year's solar terms and climate. According to the distribution of land and soil quality, we divided the area into dry, damp, and other types of cultivation zones, and jointly studied and formulated plans for drought resistance and moisture-seizing sowing in various types of areas. Then, the team cadres took responsibility for different areas and launched continuous battles. As a result, not only was more planted, and planted well, but it also ended half a month earlier than in previous years, with the progress being doubled. In the first sowing evaluation, it was found that the momentum of the second and fourth teams was not strong, and the progress was slow. It turned out that the fourth team's labor and animal power were not properly arranged. Based on this specific problem, we helped this team readjust the animal power, and the daily sowing progress doubled the next day. After going deep into the second team, I personally went to the cafeteria to work as a cook, increasing the variety of dishes and making sure that "food waits for people." As a result, the commune members were all full of energy, and in less than ten days, the sowing progress of the second team caught up with the original advanced team.

### 落后队变了样

    我们的实践证明：感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。感觉只解决现象问题，理论才解决本质问题。这些问题的解决，一点也不能离开实践。无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。

    落后队变了样
    天水吕二沟公社玉泉生产队党支部书记　赵富德
    我们天水玉泉生产队原来是个落后队，今年以来一下不同了。大秋作物比任何一年都种的快，种的好，种的多。仅仅二十多天时间就播种了八百七十多亩，占计划面积的95％以上。
    这个变化的原因是什么呢？最重要的一条就是我们深入实际，解决了生产中的问题。譬如在播种中为了作到适时，保质保量，我们召开了干部、老农、技术员会议，对今年的节令、气候作了分析，按照土地分布和土质等情况，划分了干旱、阴湿等类耕作区，共同研究制订了各类地区抗旱和抢墒播种的计划。接着由队干部分片包干，开展连续战役。结果，不仅种的多，种的好，而且比往年提早半月结束，进度加快一倍。在第一次播种评比中，发现第二、第四小队的运动声势不大，进度较迟缓。原来第四小队劳畜力安排不当，根据这一具体问题，我们帮助这个队重新调整了畜力，第二天日播种进度就提高了两倍多。在深入二小队之后，我亲自到食堂当炊事员，增加了饭菜花样，做到了“饭菜等人”。这一来，社员们个个干劲十足，不到十天，二小队的播种进度就赶上了原来的先进小队。
