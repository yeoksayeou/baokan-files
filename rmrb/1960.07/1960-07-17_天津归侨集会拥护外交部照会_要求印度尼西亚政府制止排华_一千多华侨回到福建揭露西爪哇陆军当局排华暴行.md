Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 15th: Overseas Chinese in Tianjin held a rally on the 14th, firmly supporting the solemn position taken by our Foreign Ministry in its note to the Indonesian government regarding the killing of Overseas Chinese by military authorities in West Java.

Lin Xiulan, a student at Tianjin University and daughter of the Overseas Chinese woman Ye Jinniang, who was killed by military authorities in West Java, said at the meeting: After my mother and great-aunt Yang Mumei were killed by military authorities in West Java, a handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia not only showed no intention of apologizing, but also distorted the facts and reversed black and white, attempting to shift the responsibility for the tragedy onto the Overseas Chinese. She said that the facts are facts after all, and the military authorities in West Java cannot deny them. I firmly demand that the Indonesian government punish the murderers who killed my mother and relatives, and immediately stop all anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities.

Li Guangchen, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the various demands put forward by our Foreign Ministry in its note to the Indonesian government are completely justified and reasonable. Because our government has always proceeded from safeguarding the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, it has made a series of major efforts, and thanks to the cooperation of the Indonesian side, some progress has been made in comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. However, a handful of forces in Indonesia who are hostile to Chinese-Indonesian friendship have stepped up their anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities, creating a series of unfortunate incidents, and the Cimahi massacre is only one of them. A handful of Indonesian reactionaries are doing this in order to achieve their goal of currying favor with American imperialism externally and suppressing patriotic democratic forces and all dissidents internally. He said that the evil activities of a handful of Indonesians directly violate the Indonesian government's repeated promises not to forcibly relocate people and its expressed friendly wishes. We hope that the Indonesian government will immediately stop the forced relocation and various persecutions of Overseas Chinese, and work together with the Chinese government to comprehensively and reasonably resolve the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 15th: Another group of more than a thousand Indonesian Returned Overseas Chinese arrived in Fuzhou by train from Guangdong on the 12th.

The vast majority of these Indonesian Returned Overseas Chinese came from West Java. They exposed to the people of all circles in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, who came to welcome them, the anti-Chinese atrocities of the West Java Army authorities, incited by a handful of reactionary elements in Indonesia, and expressed their support for the protest lodged by Huang Zhen, our ambassador to Indonesia, with the Indonesian government regarding the "Cimahi Massacre". He Chunpeng, the leader of this group of Returned Overseas Chinese and a compatriot from Jakarta, said: "Before we were forced to leave Indonesia, we heard anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese elements clamoring that they would not hesitate to create bloodshed. It can be seen that the Cimahi Massacre was not accidental." The Returned Overseas Chinese also revealed to their relatives in the motherland the barbaric acts of the West Java Army authorities in forcibly relocating Overseas Chinese. Chen Ganahui, Zeng Gutin, Liao Yicun, and Xu Zhenshun, Overseas Chinese from Sukabumi, said that although Sukabumi is a region above the county capital, Overseas Chinese who run small businesses are also subjected to various restrictions and difficulties, making it impossible for them to continue operating, and they have been forced to stop doing business. The West Java Army authorities also frequently dispatched armed soldiers to search the residences and shops of Overseas Chinese with guns late at night, restricted the movement of Overseas Chinese, and constantly fired guns to threaten Overseas Chinese, creating an atmosphere of terror.

　　天津归侨集会拥护外交部照会
　　要求印度尼西亚政府制止排华
　　一千多华侨回到福建揭露西爪哇陆军当局排华暴行
    据新华社天津15日电　天津市归国华侨在14日举行集会，坚决拥护我国外交部就西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨事件给印度尼西亚政府照会中所采取的严正立场。
    被西爪哇军事当局杀害的华侨妇女叶金娘的女儿、天津大学学生林秀兰在会上说：我的母亲和叔祖母杨木妹被西爪哇军事当局杀害以后，印度尼西亚一小撮反动分子不仅无意表示歉意，反而歪曲事实真相，颠倒黑白，妄图把惨案的责任推到华侨身上。她说，事实终究是事实，西爪哇军事当局是抵赖不了的。我坚决要求印度尼西亚政府惩办杀害我母亲和亲人的凶手，并立即停止一切反华排华活动。
    河北省归国华侨联合会筹备委员会主任委员李广臣说，我国外交部给印度尼西亚政府的照会中所提出的各项要求，是完全合情合理的。由于我国政府一向从维护中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊出发，作了一系列重大的努力，也由于印度尼西亚方面的合作，使全面解决华侨问题有了某些进展。但是，印度尼西亚一小撮敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力却加紧反华排华活动，制造了一系列的不幸事件，芝马圩惨案只不过是其中的一件。印度尼西亚一小撮反动分子这样做，是为了达到他们对外讨好美帝国主义，对内打击爱国民主力量和一切异己势力的目的。他说，印度尼西亚一小撮人的罪恶活动，是直接违背印度尼西亚政府一再作出的不再迫迁的诺言和所表示的友好愿望的，我们希望印度尼西亚政府立即制止对华侨的迫迁和各种迫害活动，并且和中国政府共同努力，全面、合理地解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题。
    据新华社福州15日电　又有一千多名印度尼西亚归国华侨在12日乘火车从广东到达福州。
    这一批印度尼西亚归侨绝大部分来自西爪哇，他们向前来欢迎的福建省、福州市各界人民揭露了西爪哇陆军当局在印度尼西亚一小撮反动分子策动下的排华暴行，表示支持我国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇就“芝马圩惨案”向印度尼西亚政府提出的抗议。这批归国华侨的总领队、雅加达侨胞何淳朋说：“我们被迫离开印度尼西亚前，就听到反华排华分子们扬言，将不惜制造流血事件，可见芝马圩惨案不是偶然的。”归国侨胞们还纷纷向祖国亲人们揭露了西爪哇陆军当局在迫迁华侨时的野蛮行为。来自苏甲巫眉的侨胞陈甘辉、曾谷廷、廖奕村、徐贞顺都说，苏甲巫眉虽是县首府以上的地区，但经营小商贩的华侨也同样受到种种限制和刁难，以至无法继续经营，都纷纷被迫停止营业。西爪哇陆军当局还经常出动武装军人深夜持枪搜查华侨住宅和商店，限制华侨行动，还不断地鸣枪威胁华侨，制造恐怖气氛。
