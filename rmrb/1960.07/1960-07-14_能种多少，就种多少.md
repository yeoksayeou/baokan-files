　　Plant as Much as Possible
　　Commentator of this Newspaper
    Recently, many regions across the country have experienced rainfall, which is very beneficial for rushing to plant and replant summer crops. We should seize this opportunity to rush to plant and replant, sowing all available land and planting as much as possible.
    Some people worry that the season is late and fear that planting will yield no harvest. This concern is unnecessary. The current season is not too late. The southern regions can still replant summer crops. In the northern regions, it is still possible to rush to plant and replant early-maturing corn and sweet potatoes; as for late-autumn crops such as small millet, buckwheat, carrots, and turnips, now is the time for sowing, and they can be planted until "the Beginning of Autumn." Our utilization and understanding of the seasons must be based on specific circumstances and not viewed mechanically. Under normal circumstances, we should strive for timely planting and not miss the farming season; however, when some regions fail to plant on time due to drought, flood disasters, etc., we should not mechanically emphasize that the season is late. Instead, we should utilize all possible conditions to rush to plant and replant, because planting is always better than not planting, and planting more is always better than planting less; planting less will only result in a smaller harvest, while not planting will result in no harvest at all. For certain regions planting certain crops, although it may be slightly later than the most appropriate planting time, as long as we exert subjective effort, strengthen field management, cultivate diligently, and put in more effort, it is still possible to ensure production and harvest. Even if our efforts do not achieve the expected yield, there will still be a harvest. If each mu does not yield two hundred jin, then one hundred jin or several tens of jin is still good. Even if we think of the worst-case scenario, even if we do not harvest grains, we can still harvest a large amount of straw for fodder. In short, we should adopt a down-to-earth and hardworking spirit, exert the maximum subjective effort, and fully utilize all the possibilities provided by natural conditions to achieve more planting and more harvesting, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.
    "July is gold, August is silver." Now is the critical season for agricultural production, a time to race against the clock. Planting one day earlier can increase the harvest by one point; planting one mu more can increase the harvest by one mu. All regions that have not completed their planting tasks must concentrate all their superior forces and launch a blitz to rush to plant, planting whatever can be planted and replanting whatever can be replanted, just like fighting a battle. All regions that have already completed their planting tasks must also fully mobilize the masses and use methods such as intercropping, multiple cropping, and extensive planting along the "ten edges," "finding gaps to insert needles," and so on, to expand the planting area in every possible way. As long as leading cadres can go deep into the front lines of production, participate in rushing to plant, lead the rushing to plant, and mobilize the entire party and the entire people to launch a blitz together, the summer planting tasks will surely be completed more, faster, and better.

　　能种多少，就种多少

    最近，全国很多地区下了雨，对于抢种、补种夏播作物非常有利。我们应该抓紧时机，抢种、补种，把能种的土地都种上，能种多少就种多少。
    有人担心季节已晚，怕种了没有收成。这种顾虑是不必要的。当前季节并不算晚。南方地区还能补种夏播作物。北方地区抢种、补种早熟玉米、甘薯也来得及；至于小谷子、荞麦、胡萝卜、蔓青等晚秋作物，现在正是播种时候，而且一直可以种到“立秋”。对于季节的利用和认识，必须从具体情况出发，不能机械地看待它。在正常情况下，应该力争适时播种，不误农时；可是，当有些地区因为旱、涝灾害等等原因，未能适时播种的时候，就不能机械地强调季节已晚，而应该利用一切可能的条件，抢种、补种。因为种上总比不种好，多种总比少种好；少种只能少收，不种就根本没有收成了。在某些地区播种某些作物，从最适当的播种时间来说，虽然稍晚了些，但是，只要发挥主观努力，加强田间管理，精心培育，多下功夫，还是可能保产保收。即使经过人们的努力，达不到预期的产量，但也会有收成的。每亩如果收不到二百斤，收一百斤、几十斤也是好的。即使从最坏处着想，收不到籽粒，也能收到大量的秸秆作饲料。总之，我们应该采取踏踏实实埋头苦干的精神，发挥主观的最大努力，充分利用自然条件提供的一切可能性，实现多种多收，力争秋季丰收。
    “七月金，八月银。”现在正是农业生产的关键性季节，是争分夺秒的时候。能早种一天，就能增加一分收成；能多种一亩，就能增加一亩收成。凡是没有完成播种任务的地区，要像打仗一样，集中一切优势力量，突击抢种，能种什么就种什么，能补什么就补什么。凡是已经完成播种任务的地区，也要充分发动群众，用大搞间作、套种和广种“十边”，“找缝插针”等办法，千方百计扩大播种面积。只要领导干部能深入生产第一线，参加抢种，领导抢种，动员全党全民一齐突击，夏种任务一定能完成得又多又快又好。
