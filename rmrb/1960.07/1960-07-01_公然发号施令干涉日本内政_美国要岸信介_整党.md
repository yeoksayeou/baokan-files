Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th dispatch: According to today's "Mainichi Shimbun" report, officials of the Kishi Nobusuke government revealed last night that the United States government has requested Kishi Nobusuke to take "party rectification" measures and expel some "anti-mainstream faction" leaders.

The official also revealed that this demand from the United States government to Kishi Nobusuke, ordering and interfering in Japan's internal affairs, has been conveyed to the Kishi Nobusuke government through US Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II. The official said that the United States government believes that the Kishi Nobusuke group taking a "severe attitude" towards the "anti-mainstream faction" leaders who deliberately absented themselves from the "voting" on the new "Security Treaty" in the Japanese Diet is an extremely important condition for restoring Japan's so-called "international credibility."

Today's "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" revealed that Kishi Nobusuke once stated that rather than arguing about who will be the next prime minister, it is better to carry out "party rectification" first.

    新华社30日讯　东京消息：据  “每日新闻”今天报道，岸信介政府的官员昨晚透露，美国政府要求岸信介采取“整党”手段，开除一些“反主流派”领袖。
    这个官员还透露，美国政府的这种向岸信介发号施令、干涉日本内政的要求已经通过美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二传达给岸信介政府。这位官员说，美国政府认为，岸信介集团对于在日本国会“表决”新
  “安全条约”时故意缺席不参加表决的“反主流派”领袖采取“严厉态度”，是恢复所谓日本“国际信用”的极其重要的条件。
    “产业经济新闻”今天透露，岸信介曾经表示，与其争论谁担任下届首相，不如先进行“整党”。
