Several Problems in Using Bacterial Fertilizers
Zhang Xianwu, Xu Guanghui, Wu Yaofu, Institute of Forestry and Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences

For the past six years, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted 155 field trials on the yield-increasing effects of soybean rhizobium, azotobacter, and phosphorus bacteria fertilizers in Northeast China. The results showed that yield increases were obtained in over 85% of the trials. The average yield increase of rhizobium was 12%. The average yield increase of azotobacter was: sorghum 8%, millet 10%, potato 13%, sugar beet 20%, flax 25%, and cotton 13%. Phosphorus bacteria increased the average yield of wheat and corn by 14%.

In 1959, a survey was conducted on the use of bacterial fertilizers by some agricultural science research institutes, state farms, and people's communes in Northeast China. Among eighty field yield comparison trials, more than 70% of the trials increased yields. Heilongjiang State-owned Jiusan Farm increased wheat yield by 33% using phosphorus bacteria fertilizer. Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences increased corn yield by 16% using azotobacter fertilizer. Xinjin Pikou People's Commune in Liaoning increased sweet potato yield by 74% using azotobacter fertilizer. Erdaogou Brigade of Laocheng People's Commune in Kaiyuan County increased millet yield by 48% using azotobacter fertilizer.

These materials show that using bacterial fertilizer is an economical and effective measure to increase production. However, some problems and shortcomings have also arisen in the development of bacterial fertilizers, which to some extent affect the expanded use and yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizers. The following issues are particularly noteworthy.

Reasons for the Unstable Yield-Increasing Effect of Bacterial Fertilizers

In some places, the yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizers is unstable. As mentioned above, in most cases, using bacterial fertilizer has increased yields. However, in some areas, using bacterial fertilizer has not achieved the expected yield increase. This is more obvious with azotobacter fertilizer. According to the statistics of the National Fertilizer Conference in 1957, the yield-increasing effect of azotobacter fertilizer fluctuated between 1% and 5%.

The reasons for the unstable yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizers are multifaceted. One of the most important reasons is neglecting the characteristics of bacterial fertilizers, using them improperly, and even violating the principles of use.

Bacterial fertilizer is a biological fertilizer made from some beneficial organisms in the soil. The main characteristic of bacterial fertilizer is that it is not a fertilizer itself. The fertilizer effect is the result of the life activities of these microorganisms in the soil. For example, azotobacter fixes molecular nitrogen in the air, which plants cannot use, into the soil, becoming nitrogen compounds that plants can use. Phosphorus bacteria convert organic phosphorus in the soil, which plants cannot use, into readily available phosphorus, thereby improving the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition of plants. Bacterial fertilizer contains living microorganisms, so it is closely related to external environmental conditions: the activities of microorganisms affect external conditions, and are also affected by external conditions. Bacterial fertilizer is different from organic fertilizer and even more different from chemical fertilizer. Its effect depends not only on the number and biological activity of beneficial microorganisms applied to the soil, but also on soil climate conditions and various agricultural techniques, such as soil moisture, soil aeration, soil pH, fertilization, and cultivation, etc. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions, bacterial fertilizers cannot produce the same effect under different conditions.

These characteristics of bacterial fertilizer show that we cannot treat it like chemical fertilizer. On the one hand, we must try to maintain its effectiveness before and during use. For example, high temperature, direct sunlight, and certain chemical poisons have a killing effect on microorganisms. Placing bacterial fertilizer in a hot place and letting it dry out, not covering it with soil immediately after applying it to the ground, exposing it to sunlight for too long, or mixing it with pesticides or seed dressing at the same time may reduce or even lose the fertilizer effect. On the other hand, when bacterial fertilizer is applied to the soil, we must create conditions for these beneficial microorganisms to develop vigorously and actively, such as providing sufficient water, air, and organic matter, and applying lime to acidic soils. Many experiences have proved that significant yield increases can be obtained when bacterial fertilizers are used correctly, especially under the conditions of increased application of organic and chemical fertilizers. In 1959, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science applied ammonium sulfate and azotobacter fertilizer on the basis of applying organic fertilizer, which increased yield by 50% compared with using azotobacter fertilizer alone. Organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers are not only the source of nutrition for the growth and development of microorganisms themselves, but also the objects of microbial work. For example, the organic phosphorus compounds contained in organic fertilizers are the objects decomposed by phosphorus bacteria. It is impossible to expect high yield increases from using phosphorus bacteria fertilizer in soils lacking organic matter. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that after using bacterial fertilizer, less or no other fertilizers can be applied. Only in combination with organic fertilizers and other fertilizers can bacterial fertilizers play a greater role.

Comprehensive Use of Bacterial Fertilizers and Appropriate Increase in Dosage

Under the condition of simultaneous application of organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, the comprehensive use of bacterial fertilizer and the appropriate increase in the dosage standard of bacterial fertilizer is also an effective method to ensure the yield increase of bacterial fertilizer, which has been confirmed by the experimental materials of scholars at home and abroad. Here we only cite some results of the application condition tests of azotobacter fertilizer and phosphorus bacteria fertilizer conducted by the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science in 1959. The survey results proved that the comprehensive use of phosphorus bacteria fertilizer and azotobacter fertilizer is better than the separate use. For example, in the tomato experimental field of the Lushun Vegetable Experimental Station, the comprehensive use of azotobacter and phosphorus bacteria fertilizer increased yield by 27%, while the separate use of phosphorus bacteria fertilizer only increased yield by 11%, and the separate use of azotobacter fertilizer increased yield by 14%. The effectiveness of comprehensive use of bacterial fertilizers is obviously because one kind of bacterial fertilizer can only improve the plant's demand for a certain nutrient element. If several kinds of bacterial fertilizers are used together, the supply of multiple nutrients to plants can be improved more effectively.

The increase in the amount of bacterial fertilizer used has also achieved obvious results in some trials. For example, at the Jiusan State Farm, using phosphorus bacteria fertilizer on wheat land, low dosage (applying 10 billion bacteria per mu) showed almost no yield increase, medium dosage (200 billion bacteria) increased yield by 26%, and high dosage (1 trillion bacteria) increased yield by 33%. The Haicheng County Academy of Agricultural Sciences also obtained similar results when using azotobacter fertilizer on sorghum land.

The above materials show that the yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizer is certain, but the correct method of use must be mastered. Only under the conditions of considering the characteristics of bacterial fertilizer and using bacterial fertilizer reasonably can the yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizer be fully exerted. The clearer we reveal these conditions and the more properly we use them, the greater the yield-increasing effect of bacterial fertilizer will be.

Production Methods and System Issues of Bacterial Fertilizers

The production methods and system of bacterial fertilizers are new issues raised in the Great Leap Forward of bacterial fertilizer production. On the one hand, because most of the bacterial fertilizer production in the past was concentrated in cities, transporting huge quantities of raw materials (peat, fertile soil, etc.) into the city and transporting the products to the countryside, round-trip transportation not only caused transportation difficulties, but also greatly increased costs. On the other hand, due to the insufficient source of chemical reagents for preparing bacterial fertilizers, the production efficiency of many factories has been greatly reduced, and some have almost stagnated.

Not long ago, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture promoted the "three-level system" of bacterial fertilizer production methods and systems proposed by the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has great practical significance for solving the above problems.

The so-called "three-level system" of bacterial fertilizer production means that the research institutions supply the original strains of various bacterial fertilizers, each county establishes one or several mother liquor manufacturing plants according to the conditions, and the rural commune bacterial fertilizer plants expand the propagation of the mother liquor 1-2 times using agricultural and sideline products. Then, in the commune bacterial fertilizer plant or production team, it is processed and mixed (mixing the bacterial liquid with adsorbing substances such as peat, fertile soil, or soil manure) to make bacterial fertilizer, which is directly supplied to each production team.

Following the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," the use of liquid deep aeration (aeration, shaking, or stirring) to cultivate bacterial fertilizer and the replacement of chemical reagents with cheap agricultural and sideline products as culture media has great economic significance and superiority.

Experimental research results have proved that the superiority of the liquid cultivation method of bacterial fertilizer lies in that it not only solves the problem of raw material shortage in the solid cultivation method, but also greatly improves the production efficiency of bacterial fertilizer. The liquid cultivation method has simpler equipment and higher turnover rate than the solid cultivation method. For example, solid cultivation occupies a large area of ​​the insulation room, and it takes at least four days to grow azotobacter. However, the liquid cultivation method only requires a few large tanks, and it can grow in two days. Of course, the liquid cultivation method should also pay attention to strictly preventing contamination by miscellaneous bacteria.

Using various cheap agricultural and sideline products, such as various straws, rice husks, beet residue, starch slurry, rice water, corn cobs, bean sprout soaking solution, as well as superphosphate, plant ash, slaked lime, slag soaking solution, soil soaking solution, etc., to replace the sugars and chemical reagents necessary for various bacterial fertilizer preparations is a scientifically effective way. Various agricultural and sideline products contain the nutrients needed for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms. Microorganisms need water, salts, nitrogen compounds, carbohydrates, and oxygen during growth and development. Adding sugars (sucrose, glucose, etc.) to the culture medium is mainly as a source of energy and to supply raw materials for the synthesis of bacterial cells. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and various trace elements such as manganese are all components of bacterial cells. Most agricultural and sideline products contain these substances, but the content is different. If properly adjusted, the same or even better effect as chemically synthesized culture media can be achieved.

Changes in nutritional substances can affect the physiological functions of microorganisms. Therefore, when using various substitutes to prepare bacterial fertilizer, it is best to check its activity. However, heredity and variation are opposing unity. The heredity of microorganisms has conservatism under certain conditions. If the bacterial liquid that has been cultivated for many generations is not taken to be used as seed bacteria for continued propagation, then, in the development of several generations, in general, it will not cause significant changes in the physiological functions of microorganisms.

    使用细菌肥料的几个问题
    中国科学院林业土壤研究所　张宪武、许光辉、吴尧夫
    中国科学院林业土壤研究所六年来在东北地区对大豆根瘤菌、固氮菌和磷细菌肥料进行了一百五十五次增产效果的田间试验，结果有85％以上得到了增产。根瘤菌的平均增产量是12％；固氮菌的平均增产量是：高粱8％，谷子10％，马铃薯13％，甜菜20％，亚麻25％，棉花13％；磷细菌对小麦、玉米的平均增产量是14％。
    1959年调查东北地区一部分农业科学研究所、国营农场和人民公社使用菌肥的情况，在八十个田间增产对比试验中，有70％以上的试验增加了产量。黑龙江国营九三农场，使用磷细菌肥料的小麦增产33％；吉林农业科学研究所使用固氮菌肥料玉米增产16％；辽宁新金皮口人民公社在甘薯地上使用固氮菌肥料增产74％；开原县老城人民公社二道沟大队在谷子地上使用固氮菌肥料增产48％。
    这些材料表明，使用菌肥是一项经济有效的增产措施。但是在菌肥发展的过程中也产生了一些问题和缺点。它在一定程度上影响着菌肥的扩大使用和增产作用。特别值得重视的有以下几个问题。
  菌肥增产作用不稳定的原因
    有些地方表现出菌肥增产作用不稳定。如上所述，在大多数情况下，使用菌肥提高了产量。可是在一些地区使用菌肥没有得到预期的增产效果。这一点固氮菌肥料表现得更为明显。根据1957年全国肥料会议的统计，固氮菌肥料的增产作用波动于1—5％之间。
    菌肥增产效果不稳定的原因是多方面的。最重要的原因之一，是忽视菌肥的特点，使用方法不当，甚至违反使用原则。
    菌肥是由土壤中一些有益生物制成的生物性肥料。菌肥的主要特点是：它本身并不是肥料。产生肥效的是这些微生物在土壤中生命活动的结果。例如，固氮菌把空气中植物所不能利用的分子态氮固定到土壤中，成为植物能利用的氮素化合物；磷细菌把土壤中植物所不能利用的有机态磷，转化为植物能利用的速效磷，从而改善了植物的氮素和磷素营养。菌肥内含有的是有生命的微生物，因此它与外界环境条件有着极其密切的联系：微生物的活动影响着外界条件，同时也受外界条件的影响。菌肥不同于有机肥料，更不同于化学肥料，它的作用不仅决定于施入土壤中有益微生物的数量和生物活性，而且也决定于土壤气候条件和各种农业技术条件，如土壤水分，土壤通气性，土壤酸碱度，施肥、耕作等等。由于环境条件的复杂性，所以菌肥在不同的条件下，就不可能产生同样的效果。
    菌肥的这些特点说明了，我们不能像对待化学肥料那样对待它。一方面，在使用之前和使用时，必须设法保持它的有效性。例如高温、直射阳光、某些化学毒物，对微生物都有杀伤作用。把菌肥放在热的地方任其干燥，施到地里时没有立即复土，在日光下曝晒过久，和农药放在一起或同时拌种等，都可能使菌肥降低以致失去肥效。另一方面，在菌肥施入土壤中的同时，必须为这些有益微生物创造旺盛发育和积极活动的条件，如供给充分的水分、空气和有机质，酸性土壤还要施用石灰等等。许多经验证明，凡是正确使用菌肥，特别是在增施有机肥料和化学肥料的条件下，均能得到显著的增产效果。林业土壤研究所1959年在施用有机肥料的基础上增施硫铵和固氮菌肥料，比单独使用固氮菌肥料增产50％。有机肥料和化学肥料，不但是微生物本身生长发育的营养来源，而且也是微生物工作的对象。比如，有机肥料中所含有的有机磷化物，就是磷细菌分解的对象。不能设想，在土壤中缺乏有机物质的条件下，使用磷细菌肥料可以得到很高的增产效果。因此，不能认为使用菌肥以后就可以少施，或者不施其它肥料。只有在配合使用有机肥料及其他各种肥料的情况下，菌肥才能发挥它更大的作用。
    综合使用菌肥，适当提高菌肥用量
    在同时施用有机肥料和化学肥料的条件下，综合使用菌肥和适当提高菌肥的用量标准，也是保证菌肥增产的有效方法，这一点已经为国内外学者的试验材料所证实。在这里我们只举林业土壤研究所1959年对固氮菌肥料和磷细菌肥料所作的应用条件试验的一些结果。调查的结果证明，磷细菌肥料与固氮菌肥料综合使用，比单独使用好。如旅大蔬菜试验站在番茄试验田中，综合使用固氮菌和磷细菌肥料，增产27％；而单独使用磷细菌肥料只增产11％，单独使用固氮菌肥料的增产14％。综合使用菌肥的有效性，显然是由于一种菌肥只能改善植物对某一种营养元素的需求。如果把几种菌肥一起使用，就可以更有效地改善植物多种养分的供应。
    菌肥用量的提高在一些试验中也得到了明显的效果。例如，国营九三农场在小麦地上使用磷细菌肥料，低量（每亩地施入一百亿个菌）几乎看不出增产作用，中量（二千亿个菌）增产26％，高量（一万亿个菌）增产33％。海城县农业科学研究所在高粱地上使用固氮菌肥料，也有类似结果。
    上述材料说明，菌肥的增产效果是肯定的，但必须掌握正确的使用方法。只有在考虑了菌肥的特点，合理地使用菌肥的条件下，菌肥的增产作用才能充分发挥出来。而我们对这些条件揭发得越清楚，使用得越得法，菌肥的增产效果也就会越大。
  菌肥的生产方法与体制问题
    菌肥的生产方法与体制，这是在菌肥生产大跃进中提出的一个新的问题。一方面，由于过去菌肥生产大部集中在城市，把数量巨大的原材料
  （泥炭、肥土等）运进城，把产品运下乡，往返运输，不仅造成了运输的困难，而且也使成本大大提高。另一方面，由于培制菌肥的化学药品来源不足，以致不少工厂生产效率大为降低，有的几乎趋于停顿状态。
    不久前，辽宁省农业厅推行了根据中国科学院林业土壤研究所提出的
  “三级制”菌肥生产方法和体制，对解决上述问题有着重大的实践意义。
    所谓菌肥生产“三级制”，就是由研究机关供应各种菌肥的原始菌种，各县根据条件设立一处或几处母剂制造工厂，农村公社菌肥厂把母剂利用农副产物扩大繁殖1——2次，然后在公社菌肥厂或生产队加工搅拌（将菌液与泥炭、肥土或土粪等吸附物质拌合）制成菌肥，直接供给各生产队使用。
    循着“土洋结合”的方针，采用液体深层通气（通气、振荡或搅拌）培制菌肥，并以廉价的农副产品代替化学药品作培养基，具有很大的经济意义和优越性。
    试验研究结果证明，液体培制菌肥方法的优越性在于，不但解决了固体培养方法中原料缺乏问题，而且大大提高了菌肥生产效率。液体培养法比固体培养法设备简单，周转率高。例如，固体培养所占保温室面积很大，培养固氮菌至少得四天才能长成。而液体培养法，只要几口大缸，两天就可长成。当然，液体培养方法也应当注意严格防止污染杂菌。
    利用各种廉价的农副产品，如各种藁秆、米壳、甜菜渣、粉浆、米汤、苞米蕊、豆芽浸液以及过磷酸钙、草木灰、熟石灰、炉渣浸液、土壤浸液等等，代替各种培制菌肥所必需的糖类和化学药品，是一种合乎科学的有效途径。各种农副产物含有微生物生长繁殖所需要的养分。微生物在生长发育中，需要水、盐类、氮素化合物、碳水化合物及氧气等。培养基中添加糖类（蔗糖，葡萄糖等），主要是作为能的来源和供给合成菌体细胞原料。氮、磷、钾、钠、钙、镁、铁及各种微量元素如锰等，都是构成菌体细胞的成份。在大多数农副产品中都含有这些物质，只是含量不同，如果加以适当调节，就能收到与化学合成培养基同样甚至更好的效果。
    营养物质的改变可以影响微生物的生理机能。因此，在利用各种代用品培制菌肥时，最好能检查一下它的活动性。但是，遗传性和变异性是对立的统一。微生物的遗传性在一定条件下具有保守性，如果不是把已经培养多代的菌液，再拿来作种菌继续繁殖，那么，在若干代的发育中，一般说来，不致引起微生物生理机能的重大变异。
