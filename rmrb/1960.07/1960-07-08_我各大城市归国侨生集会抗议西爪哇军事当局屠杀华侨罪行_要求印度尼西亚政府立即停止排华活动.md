Xinhua News Agency, July 7th -- Returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Fuzhou, Nanning, Kunming, Xiamen, Shantou, and other cities have recently held rallies to strongly protest the bloody crime of the West Java military authorities in Indonesia who shot and killed overseas Chinese women. They demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop forced evictions, punish the murderers, provide compensation to the families of the victims, and release the arrested overseas Chinese.

Returned overseas Chinese students from Peking University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Normal College, and Beijing Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School have all held protest rallies. At the rally at Beijing Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, Liu Yuguang, an Indonesian overseas Chinese student who returned from Cimahi this February, said that in Cimahi, his family and the family of the victim Yang Mu Mei were neighbors twice. He had known her since he was a child and knew that she was a small overseas Chinese merchant who lived by her own hard work and was a very good person. She was very kind to their children and to the Indonesian people, often using her savings to help her Indonesian neighbors solve their difficulties. Now, while she was four months pregnant, she was innocently shot and killed, and Indonesian friends will never see this good neighbor again. Liu Yuguang expressed strong protest against the atrocities of the West Java military authorities and firmly demanded that the Indonesian government punish the murderers and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

Overseas Chinese students who were recently forced to return to Guangzhou from Indonesia expressed great indignation at the crime of the West Java military authorities in massacring overseas Chinese. On the afternoon of the 5th, they held protest rallies in three different locations. At a meeting of more than 1,000 teachers and students at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, Xie Lanmei, a returned overseas Chinese student whose parents had been persecuted by the West Java military authorities, said that on New Year's Day this year, her family was persecuted by the West Java military authorities and was taken to a concentration camp for two months. Her parents suffered severe mental blows and fell ill upon returning to China. Now, the anti-Chinese activities of the West Java military authorities have intensified, and they have even shot and killed overseas Chinese women. She expressed her firm protest against this. Students at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School also posted many large-character posters on the walls of classrooms, dormitories, and the auditorium, protesting the crime of the West Java military authorities in massacring overseas Chinese.

At a rally held by returned overseas Chinese students at Tongji University in Shanghai, Chen Chengzhang, a second-year student majoring in silicate, who returned from Cimahi, Indonesia, said angrily that his family still lives in Cimahi. His brother recently wrote to say that powerful groups in Indonesia are confiscating the property of overseas Chinese, insulting overseas Chinese women, and doing everything possible to prevent overseas Chinese from returning to China. Now, the West Java military authorities have even killed overseas Chinese women, which is absolutely intolerable. He expressed his full support for Ambassador Huang Zhen's serious protest and demands to the Indonesian government. After a rally, all the returned overseas Chinese students at Fudan University jointly wrote a letter of protest, stating that the intensification of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities by powerful groups in Indonesia will only backfire and bring about their own destruction. Overseas Chinese students at Caoyang Middle School have been writing protest letters and publishing special issues of blackboard newspapers for days, strongly protesting the crime of the West Java military authorities in killing overseas Chinese. In their collective letter of protest, they demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers of overseas Chinese, compensate the families of the victims, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, stop forced evictions, and take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future.

At a protest rally held by returned overseas Chinese students in Tianjin on the 6th, Su Yunqing, a member of the Tianjin Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a student at Nankai University, spoke on behalf of all returned overseas Chinese students in the city. She angrily protested the atrocities of the West Java military authorities in shooting and killing overseas Chinese women, and expressed her firm support for the serious protest made by our Ambassador Huang Zhen to the Indonesian government on this matter. Representatives of returned overseas Chinese students from Hebei University, Tianjin Medical University, Hebei Institute of Technology, Nankai Middle School, and other schools spoke at the meeting, strongly protesting the creation of bloody incidents by powerful groups in Indonesia. Lin Caiying, a returned overseas Chinese student at Tianjin University, said at another protest rally that Cimahi was once burned to the ground by Dutch colonialists, and later rebuilt brick by brick by local overseas Chinese and Indonesian people. More than 80% of the overseas Chinese living there are artisans and small merchants who have made many contributions to the prosperity of the local economy and have established deep friendships with the local people. Now, powerful groups in Indonesia are persecuting overseas Chinese by various means, attempting to undermine the friendship between the two peoples. Their conspiracy will never succeed.

At a protest rally of returned overseas Chinese in Shenyang, Li Baonan, a returned overseas Chinese student at the Northeast Institute of Technology, said that the West Java military authorities in Indonesia killed innocent overseas Chinese compatriots and attempted to eliminate the evidence of the crime, snatching the bodies of overseas Chinese and washing away the bloodstains on the ground with water. However, the evidence is complete, and they cannot deny it. All the returned overseas Chinese students from Liaoning University, Shenyang Medical College, Shenyang Agricultural College, and Shenyang Institute of Physical Education also expressed at the rallies their full support for Ambassador Huang Zhen's protest to the Indonesian government regarding the Cimahi incident, demanding that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims of overseas Chinese, and immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese.

Returned overseas Chinese students in Fuzhou have held rallies for days to strongly protest the atrocities of the West Java military authorities in killing overseas Chinese. At a protest rally held at Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Middle School on the 6th, Lin Liyan, a returned overseas Chinese female student, said that the shooting of overseas Chinese by the West Java military authorities was not accidental, but was deliberately created by powerful groups who are hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia. The Indonesian Army authorities fabricated lies and attempted to deny the West Java military authorities' responsibility for the killing, but this cannot cover up the truth. The Indonesian authorities have no reason to shirk their responsibility.

More than 30 returned overseas Chinese students who returned from Cimahi this March and are studying at Jimei Overseas Chinese School in Xiamen also held a protest rally on the 6th. Jiang Xiaozhen, a returned overseas Chinese student, said at the meeting that he grew up in Cimahi. Yang Mu Mei and Ye Jin Niang, who were killed by the West Java military authorities, were both his good neighbors. They worked hard all year round and lived in close harmony with the local Indonesian people. Now the West Java military authorities have killed these unarmed overseas Chinese women, which is intolerable. We firmly demand that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, compensate the families of the victims, release the arrested overseas Chinese, and immediately stop anti-Chinese activities.

At a protest meeting held by teachers and students of the Nanning Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School in Guangxi on the 6th, Mei Zhongxian, the deputy principal and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said with indignation that overseas Chinese have made beneficial contributions to the Indonesian economy and have a long and deep friendship with the Indonesian people. Like Bangka Penang, where I lived for many years, the construction of every road there involved a lot of blood and sweat from the overseas Chinese. In the struggle against the invasion of Indonesia by Dutch imperialism, many overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives. Now, hundreds of memorial tablets of overseas Chinese victims are still left in the Grand Uncle Temple there. Now, under the instigation and support of powerful groups in Indonesia, the West Java military authorities have shot and killed overseas Chinese, and I cannot help but feel extremely indignant.

    我各大城市归国侨生集会抗议西爪哇军事当局屠杀华侨罪行
    要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止排华活动
    据新华社7日讯　北京、广州、上海、天津、沈阳、福州、南宁、昆明、厦门、汕头等地的归国华侨学生，近日纷纷集会，严重抗议印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局枪杀华侨妇女的血腥罪行，要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止逼迁、惩办凶手、抚恤死难者家属，释放被捕华侨。
    北京大学、北京工业学院、北京农业大学、北京师范学院、北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校的归国华侨学生，都举行了抗议集会。在北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校的集会上，今年2月从芝马圩回国的印度尼西亚华侨学生刘玉光说，在芝马圩时，我家和受难者杨木妹家曾经两次作邻居。我从小就熟悉她，知道她是华侨小商贩，依靠自己的辛勤劳动过日子，是一个很好的人。她对我们孩子，对印度尼西亚人民都十分善良，常常把省吃俭用节约下来的一点钱，帮助邻居的印度尼西亚人民，解决他们的困难。现在，正当她怀孕四月的时候，无辜地被枪杀了，印度尼西亚朋友们再也看不见这位好邻居了。刘玉光对西爪哇军事当局的暴行，表示强烈抗议，坚决要求印度尼西亚政府惩办凶手，保证不再发生类似事件。
    最近被迫从印度尼西亚回到广州的华侨学生，对西爪哇军事当局惨杀华侨的罪行，表示十分愤慨，他们在5日下午分三处地方举行抗议集会。在广州市归国华侨学生中等补习学校一千多名师生举行的大会上，父母亲曾遭西爪哇军事当局迫害的归侨学生谢兰妹说，今年元旦，我的一家人受到西爪哇军事当局的迫害，被抓去住了两个月的集中营。我的父母亲精神上受到严重打击，回国时病倒了。现在，西爪哇军事当局的排华活动变本加厉，竟枪杀华侨妇女。对此，我要表示坚决抗议。广州市归国华侨学生中等补习学校的学生们，还在课堂、宿舍、大礼堂的墙壁上，张贴许多张大字报，抗议印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局屠杀华侨的罪行。
    在上海同济大学归侨学生举行的集会上，从印度尼西亚芝马圩归来的硅酸盐专业二年级学生陈成章愤怒地说，我的家现在还住在芝马圩，我哥哥最近来信说，印度尼西亚有势力集团在那里没收华侨财产，污辱华侨妇女，千方百计地阻挠华侨回国。现在，西爪哇军事当局竟然杀害华侨妇女，这是绝对不能容忍的。他表示完全拥护黄镇大使向印度尼西亚政府提出的严重抗议和各项要求。复旦大学全体归侨学生在集会以后，共同写了一封抗议书，抗议书中说，印度尼西亚有势力集团加紧反华排华，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，自食其恶果。曹杨中学的华侨学生连日来纷纷写抗议信并出版黑板报专刊，强烈抗议印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨的罪行。在他们集体写的抗议书中，要求印度尼西亚政府严惩杀害华侨的凶手，抚恤被害者家属，立即释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁，并采取有效措施保证将来不再发生类似事件。
    在天津市归国华侨学生6日举行的抗议集会上，天津市归国华侨联合会委员、南开大学学生苏韵清代表全市归国华侨学生讲话。她愤怒抗议西爪哇军事当局枪杀华侨妇女暴行，并表示坚决拥护我国黄镇大使就这件事向印度尼西亚政府提出的严重抗议。河北大学、天津医科大学、河北工学院、南开中学等学校的归国华侨学生代表，纷纷在会上讲话，他们强烈抗议印度尼西亚有势力集团制造流血惨案。天津大学归侨学生林彩英在另一次抗议集会上说，过去芝马圩被荷兰殖民主义者烧成一片焦土，后经当地华侨和印度尼西亚人民一起一砖一瓦地兴建起来。居住在那里的华侨80％以上是手工业者和小商贩，他们对繁荣当地的经济作出了不少贡献，同当地人民建立了深厚的友谊。现在印度尼西亚有势力集团竟用各种手段迫害华侨，妄图破坏两国人民的友谊，他们的这种阴谋是永远不会得逞的。
    在沈阳归国华侨的一次抗议集会上，东北工学院归国华侨学生李宝南说，印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害无辜侨胞，并妄图消灭罪证，抢走华侨尸体，用水冲刷地上血迹。但是，罪证俱在，他们是无法抵赖的。辽宁大学、沈阳医学院、沈阳农学院和沈阳体育学院的全体归侨学生，也分别在集会上表示完全拥护黄镇大使就芝马圩事件向印度尼西亚政府提出的抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手，抚恤被害华侨家属，并立即停止迫害华侨的活动。
    福州市归国华侨学生连日集会，强烈抗议西爪哇军事当局杀害华侨的暴行。在福州市华侨中学6日举行的抗议集会上，归国华侨女学生林丽燕说，西爪哇军事当局枪杀华侨，并非出于偶然，而是敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的有势力集团蓄意制造的。印度尼西亚陆军当局捏造谎言，妄图抵赖西爪哇军事当局的杀人罪责，是掩盖不了事实真相的。印度尼西亚当局没有任何理由推卸应负的责任。
    今年3月，才从芝马圩回国、在厦门市集美侨校学习的三十多位归国华侨学生，6日也举行抗议集会。归国华侨学生江孝振在会上说，我从小在芝马圩长大。被西爪哇军事当局杀死的杨木妹、叶金娘都是我的好邻居。她们终年辛勤劳动，和当地印度尼西亚人民亲密相处。现在西爪哇军事当局竟杀死这些手无寸铁的华侨妇女，这是令人难以容忍的。我们坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手，抚恤被害者家属，释放被捕华侨，并立即停止排华的活动。
    在广西南宁归国华侨学生中等补习学校师生6日举行的抗议大会上，副校长、印度尼西亚归侨梅仲娴愤慨地说，华侨对印度尼西亚的经济作了有益的贡献，和印度尼西亚人民有着悠久而深厚的友谊。像我住过多年的邦加槟港，那里每一条道路的修筑，华侨都流了不少的血汗。在反抗荷兰帝国主义侵入印度尼西亚的斗争中，有不少华侨献出了生命，现在那里的大伯公庙里，还留下成百个华侨牺牲者的灵位。现在，在印度尼西亚有势力集团的策动和支持下，西爪哇军事当局竟枪杀华侨，我不能不感到万分愤慨。（附图片）
