    Breaking the Old Routine of Cutting and Saving
    Che Xueliang, an old technical worker at the Dalian Garment Factory who draws patterns, has broken the old routine of cutting. In the past, when cutting blue cloth clothes, white cloth was always used for the cloth bags or waistband lining, which left some remnants of the natural-colored cloth, accumulating in the warehouse. Now he uses the remaining materials to make cloth bags and waistband linings, making the clothes both beautiful and saving materials. Each set of youth clothing reduces material consumption by 0.06 meters. He has also researched a reasonable nesting method of using large pieces for large purposes, small pieces for small purposes, and comprehensive utilization, which reduces material consumption. Cloth scraps that were previously considered unusable are now being used to make children's clothes and shorts.

    打破裁活老常规
    大连被服厂画样子的老技术工人车学良打破了老一套的裁活常规。过去裁蓝色布衣服，一律用白色布做布袋或裤腰里子，这样本色布就剩些余料，积压在仓库里。现在他用剩余料做布袋和裤腰里子，衣服既美观又省料。每套青年服就降低用料零点零六米。他还研究出大材大用，小材小用及综合利用的合理套裁法，降低了用料。过去认为不成材的布头，现在都利用了起来，裁成了小孩衣服和短裤。
