The Huojiaying Breeding Pig Farm in Shahe People's Commune, Changping County, Beijing, has established piglet breeding stations, greatly increasing the survival rate of piglets.

When the pig farm did not implement the management methods of piglet breeding stations in the first quarter, the mortality rate of piglets was very high. The entire farm produced 74 litters with 598 piglets in three months, of which 20% died from being crushed by the sows or due to lack of milk. After the establishment of the piglet breeding station in April, a total of 9 litters with 80 piglets were produced, and none have died so far. The weight gain of piglets is also fast, with an average daily weight gain of 3 liang per head, an increase of one-third compared to the past.

The specific practice of Huojiaying Breeding Pig Farm in implementing piglet breeding stations is to implement sow-piglet isolation after the sow gives birth, separate strong and weak piglets into different pens, and feed them regularly. Weak piglets are selected and nursed separately by sows with good milk supply. If some sows do not have enough milk, bean, corn, and barley mixed into a slurry are used and placed in a feeding bottle to supplement the piglets' diet. Generally, piglets within seven days after birth are breastfed every hour, and after seven days, a small amount of cooked beans and corn are added, and milk is fed every two hours. After the piglets are over 20 days old, according to the sow's milk supply, green and roughage are gradually added, and concentrated feed is appropriately supplemented. After 45 days, they leave the breeding station and are merged into large group feeding.

The experience of Huojiaying Breeding Pig Farm proves that running piglet breeding stations is a good way to increase the survival rate of piglets and accelerate the growth of pig herds. From the current implementation, its advantages are:

First, after the sow gives birth, the implementation of sow-piglet isolation can also promote early estrus and early breeding of the sow. Second, it avoids accidents such as piglets being crushed or trampled to death by the sows. At the same time, because the environment of the piglet breeding station is clean and dry, and not mixed with the sow, the piglets do not eat the sow's feces and other dirty things, which can avoid diseases such as white dysentery and gastroenteritis. Third, it enables piglets to get used to group feeding life from an early age. Fourth, it facilitates large group feeding and separate group management, and weak piglets can be taken care of.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch: The sows of the state-owned Sui'bin Breeding Farm under the Hejiang Reclamation Bureau of Heilongjiang Province have a very high survival rate of piglets. In the past two months, all of the more than 100 litters with more than 1,400 piglets produced by the farm have survived and are growing healthily.

This farm has done a good job in the prevention and hygiene of pigs. In the first half of this year, there were several outbreaks of swine fever in the local area, but none of them affected the pigs on this farm. This time, to welcome the sows to give birth, the breeders of the pig breeding team took the initiative to move into the pigsty to live and take care of the sows and piglets carefully. Once, because it was cold, more than 100 newly born piglets were frozen, and the breeders took various measures to finally save all the piglets.

### 霍家营种猪场大办仔猪饲养所  绥滨种畜场照料细致仔猪全部成活

    霍家营种猪场大办仔猪饲养所
    绥滨种畜场照料细致仔猪全部成活
    本报讯　北京市昌平县沙河人民公社霍家营种猪场，创办仔猪饲养所，大大提高了仔猪成活率。
    这个猪场在第一季度没有实行仔猪饲养所的管理办法时，仔猪的死亡率很高。全场三个月产仔七十四窝，五百九十八头，其中仅被母猪压死或因缺奶致死的就达20％。4月份办起仔猪饲养所以后，共产仔九窝八十头，至今无一头死亡。仔猪体重增长也快，平均每头日增重三两，比过去提高了三分之一。
    霍家营种猪场实行仔猪饲养所的具体作法是在母猪产仔后实行仔母隔离，强弱分圈，定时哺乳。瘦弱的小猪挑出来单独由奶水好的母猪哺乳。有些母猪奶水不足，就用豆子、玉米、大麦混合磨成浆水，放入哺奶器内为小猪补食。母猪哺乳时间，一般产后七天以内的仔猪每隔一小时哺乳一次，七天以后，开始加喂少量煮熟的豆子、玉米等，每两小时喂奶一次。小猪长过二十天后，根据母猪奶水的情况，逐步加喂青粗饲料，适当补喂精料。这样经过四十五天就离开饲养所，合并大群饲养。
    霍家营种猪场的经验证明，办仔猪饲养所是提高仔猪成活率加快猪群增长的好办法。从目前实行的情况看，它的好处有：
    第一，母猪产仔后，实行仔母隔离，还能促使母猪早发情，早配种。第二，避免了仔猪被母猪压死、踩死等事故发生。同时，由于仔猪饲养所环境清洁、干燥，不与母猪混在一起，吃不到母猪的粪便等脏东西，能避免发生白痢、肠胃等疾病。第三，使小猪从小就习惯群体饲养生活。第四，便于大群饲养、分群管理，瘦弱小猪可以得到照顾。
    新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江省合江农垦局所属国营绥滨种畜场的母猪群，所产仔猪成活率很高。最近两个月来全场所产的一百多窝一千四百多头仔猪，全部成活，生长健壮。
    这个场对猪的防疫卫生工作作得较好。今年上半年，当地发生几次猪疫，都没有影响到这个场的猪。这次迎接母猪产仔，养猪队的饲养员都主动搬到猪舍住宿，精心照料母猪和仔猪。有一次因为天冷，一百多头刚产下的仔猪受冻，饲养员采取各种办法终于将这批仔猪全部救活。
