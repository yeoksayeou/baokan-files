Communist Party Secretary's Notebook

    “Why So Many Erhu Strings?”
　　Zhao Jixian, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal First Commercial Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    One day this spring, someone from the farm tool factory of Jinshui Commune in Wuchang County came to Hankou. He hurried into the sports goods and instrument store and asked urgently, “Do you sell erhu strings at your store?” The salesperson who received the customer replied, “Yes! How many do you want?” “I want as many as you have.” This surprised the salesperson, who quickly explained, “The erhu strings we sell are for entertainment purposes. Why do you need so many?” “Comrade, we are working on rice transplanters in the countryside and urgently need erhu strings to tie the pig bristles underneath.” The salesperson did not fulfill the customer's request at the time but supplied a portion and told him, “We will find a solution immediately.”
    At that time, the salesperson reported the need for erhu strings for rural rice transplanters to the Party branch. The branch held an emergency meeting and decided that all the employees of the store would take action immediately, marching in three directions: one group was sent to the countryside to understand the needs, one group was assigned to clear the warehouse, and one group was designated to contact other places for procurement. A touching scene of "everyone fighting to support agriculture" emerged.
    Unexpectedly, the rural rice transplanters needed 600 jin of erhu strings, while the inventory was only 3 jin. Contacting other places by phone and telegram also said there was no supply. At this crucial moment, the store's Party branch held another emergency meeting, mobilizing the masses to come up with ideas and break through the erhu string bottleneck to support the great development of agriculture. After discussion, everyone concluded that only the Nanhu Silk Thread Factory in Wuhan produced erhu strings, and even if production was doubled, it would not solve the needs of the counties. The only good way was to send people to the factory to learn the technology of producing erhu strings and then go to the countryside to teach the technology for on-site production. The Party branch adopted this suggestion, determined to "first be students, then be teachers," and put forward the slogan "work hard for a day and learn the technology of making erhu strings," immediately organizing ten employees to study at the Nanhu Silk Thread Factory.
    The continuous spring rain kept falling, but it could not stop the determination of commercial employees to support agriculture. Braving the heavy rain, they entered the Nanhu Silk Thread Factory and, regardless of physical fatigue, immediately began to learn the entire production technology of soaking silk, mounting the frame, unwinding silk, drawing silk, twisting strands, winding thread, gluing, and spreading to dry. In particular, the gluing process had to be done in the open square, and it happened to be raining; but in order to gain time to learn the technology, they worked in the rain. After such a hard day, they finally learned the production technology and compiled a manual on the operation of producing erhu strings, finding "capital" for teaching technology in the countryside.
    With technology, there also had to be raw materials for producing erhu strings, but these raw materials—raw silk and fish glue—were very scarce materials that were not easy to obtain in the countryside. If they were not delivered to the countryside as a complete set, the needs of the rice transplanters would still not be solved. What to do? All the employees of the store used their extensive connections and knowledge to ask relevant units for help. In this way, everyone took action, seeking assistance everywhere, and successively obtained 600 jin of raw silk and 100 jin of fish glue, stocking up on "supplies," reviewing the technology, and starting the "expedition" to the fifteen counties in the suburbs of Wuhan.
    This group of new technicians, carrying luggage and raw materials—raw silk and fish glue—set off for the countryside in five groups with joyful hearts. Zhao Jingwen, a salesperson at the cultural goods company, had a breastfeeding child, but she entrusted the child to others and also joined the ranks of going to the countryside. These commercial employees opened training classes overnight in each place they arrived, took out the raw materials, operated and explained at the same time, starting early and working late, teaching patiently until they had taught everyone. In this way, they ran all over the fifteen counties in the suburbs of Wuhan, training eighty-two technicians, so that 180,000 rice transplanters could be put into spring planting production in a timely manner. The peasants enthusiastically called these commercial employees "sending charcoal in the snow" and "good cadres of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." A commune in Tongshan County wrote in a letter, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be cities supporting the countryside. We will definitely guarantee a bumper harvest in agriculture to support the cities."
    This brilliant example of supporting agricultural technology transformation quickly became the direction for Wuhan's commercial departments to fully support agriculture. Now a wave of "doing good things for agriculture with all our hearts" has been formed, setting off a mass movement of going to the countryside to visit and establish connections, understanding agricultural needs, and carrying out "three helps" (helping to formulate production plans, helping to solve materials, helping to solve technology), "three on-sites" (obtaining materials on-site, producing on-site, supplying on-site), "four guarantees" (guaranteeing supply, guaranteeing teaching, guaranteeing repair, guaranteeing use), and "six transformations" (transforming from nothing to something, from small to large, from few varieties to many varieties, from small quantities to large quantities, from high cost to low cost, from low quality to high quality). Supporting agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation from all aspects, taking the initiative to focus on the Party's central work, and fully preparing for the supply of means of production according to the different production seasons and the needs of agricultural technology transformation, while promoting the production of agricultural means of production needed by commune-run industries, arming themselves. Now we have supported the countryside with more than 5,000 tons of various means of production, more than 23,000 pieces of various tools and equipment, helped the countryside build and expand more than 500 factories, and cooperated with industrial departments to repair more than 920,000 pieces of farm tools, presenting a situation of "supplying whatever agriculture needs; supplying whenever needed; always walking in front of agricultural production, not missing the agricultural season," effectively promoting agricultural production development and agricultural technology transformation.

### “为什么要这么多胡琴弦？”

    “为什么要这么多胡琴弦？”
　　中共武汉市第一商业局委员会第一书记　赵吉先
    今年春天的一天，武昌县金水公社农具厂派人来到了汉口，匆匆忙忙地走进了体育文具仪器商店，他以紧急的心情问了一句：“你们商店卖不卖胡琴弦？”接待这位顾客的营业员回答说：“有！你要多少？”“有多少，我要多少。”这一下，使营业员大吃了一惊，他连忙解释说：“我们卖的胡琴弦是供应娱乐方面拉胡琴用的，你为什么要这么多？”“同志，我们农村正在搞插秧机，急需要用胡琴弦来捆下面的猪鬃哩。”营业员当时没有满足顾客的要求，供应了一部分，并告诉他：“我们马上设法解决。”
    当时，营业员把农村插秧机需要胡琴弦的情况，反映到支部，支部召开了紧急会议，决定全店职工马上行动，分三路进军，一路派人到农村了解需要，一路指定专人清一清仓库，一路确定专人向外地联系采购。出现了“人人为支援农业而战”的动人景象。
    出人意料之外的是，农村插秧机需要的胡琴弦得六百斤，而库存只有三斤，向外地打电话、电报联系，也说没货供应。在这关键的时刻，商店党支部又召开了紧急会议，发动群众想办法，出主意，突破胡琴弦关，支援农业大发展。大家议论的结果，武汉只有一家南湖丝线厂生产胡琴弦，就是帮助它再扩大生产计划一倍，也解决不了各县的需要。唯一的好办法，就是派人到工厂去学习生产胡琴弦的技术，然后到农村传授技术就地生产，党支部采纳了这个意见，决心“先当学生，后当先生”，提出了“苦战一天，学会制胡琴弦技术”的口号，立即组织了十个职工到南湖丝线厂学习。
    连绵的春雨下个不停，但阻挡不了商业职工支援农业的决心。他们冒着大雨，走进了南湖丝线厂，不顾身体的疲劳，马上开始学习浸丝、上耙、倒丝、拔丝、合股、打线、上胶、摊晒等整个生产技术了。特别是上胶这道工序，要在露天广场上操作，又碰上天雨；但他们为了争取时间学会技术，就在雨中干起来。经过这样一天的苦战，终于学会了生产技术，编写了一本生产胡琴弦操作的资料，为下农村传授技术找到了“本钱”。
    有了技术，还要有生产胡琴弦的原材料，而这些原材料——生丝、鱼胶，都是非常缺乏的物资，农村不容易搞得到，如果不成龙配套的下乡，还是解决不了插秧机上的需要。怎么办呢？全店职工利用关系多，消息灵的有利条件，找有关单位帮助解决。就这样人人动手，处处求援，先后搞到了生丝六百斤，鱼胶一百斤，备足了“粮草”，检阅了技术，开始了对武汉郊区十五县的“远征”。
    这批新技术员，背上行李，带上原料——生丝、鱼胶，以喜悦的心情，分五路下乡了。文化用品公司营业员赵静文有个吃奶的小孩，她把孩子交给别人管，也参加了下乡的行列。这些商业职工每到一地，就连夜开训练班，拿出原料，一面操作，一边讲解，起早贪黑，耐心地教，一直到教会为止。就这样，披星戴月地跑遍了武汉郊区十五个县，训练了八十二名技术员，使十八万部插秧机及时投入了春播生产。农民热情地称这些商业职工是“雪里送炭”，是“共产党、毛主席的好干部”。通山县的一个公社来信说：“只有在共产党的领导下，才有城市支援农村，我们一定保证农业大丰收，来支援城市。”
    这个支援农业技术改造的光辉范例，迅速成为武汉商业部门全面支援农业的方向。现在已形成一心为生产，人人“为农业大办好事”的热潮，掀起了群众性的下乡访问挂钩，了解农业需要，开展了三帮
  （帮助制订生产规划、帮助解决物资、帮助解决技术），三就（就地取材、就地生产、就地供应），四包（包供应、包教、包修、包用），六变（由无变有、由小变大、由品种少变品种多、由数量少变数量多、由成本高变成本低、由质量低变质量高）的群众运动。从各方面支援农业生产和农业技术改造，主动围绕党的中心工作，根据农业不同生产季节和农业技术改造的需要，全面作好生产资料供应，同时促进社办工业生产农业需要的生产资料，自己武装自己。现在我们已经支援农村各种生产资料五千多吨，各种工具设备二万三千多件，帮助农村新建和扩建工厂五百多个，配合工业部门修好了农具九十二万多件，呈现出“农业需要什么供应什么；什么时候需要，什么时候供应；事事走在农业生产前面，不误农时”的局面，有力地促进了农业生产发展和农业技术改造。
