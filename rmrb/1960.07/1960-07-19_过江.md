　　Crossing the River
　　Li Liechu
    Standing on the top of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station dam, watching the undulating mountains, I feel the world is exceptionally vast. In front of the dam, there is an endless, rippling artificial lake; behind the dam, there is a brand-new city, with factories like forests. The smoke rising from the chimneys flutters with the spring breeze, closely reflecting the blue sky…

    All of this hasn't had time to be marked with any new symbols on the map. Three or four years ago, this place was sparsely populated. Only the azalea flowers, spitting fire and steaming rosy clouds once a year, covered the primitive valley with a red blanket.

    What a great change here! As I happily walked from the right bank to the left bank across the top of the dam, I couldn’t help but recall how I used to cross the Xin'an River!

    At the end of 1956, our construction team was still stationed in Xitongguan Village on the right bank—now, Xitongguan has become the home of fish, at the bottom of the huge artificial lake.

    At that time, Xitongguan used kerosene lamps; while Dongtongguan, where the survey team lived, had generators. At night, the lights were brilliant, and we could even watch movies. We envied Dongtongguan. However, to get from Xitongguan to Dongtongguan, you had to cross the river. The river was extremely wide. There was a large awning boat that specifically "ee-ah, ee-ah" ferried people. Each boat could only carry forty or fifty people, and each crossing took a good while. At the docks of Dongtongguan and Xitongguan, there were long lines. With the movie about to start, everyone was extremely anxious!

    When the flood started, the ferry had to face the current diagonally to push upstream—the pole man, planted the pole, pushed hard, leaned his whole body forward, and gradually fell straight onto the deck, how strenuous! When the flood was large, the white waves soared to the sky, like ten thousand horses galloping, and the boat simply couldn't pass. Then we could only sigh at the river.

    The flood sealed off the ferry, but it could not seal off our determination to build the hydropower station. We lit kerosene lamps, cleared away the snow, and worked day and night to split the mountain and build roads, transporting generators and air compressors. The construction site became a city that never sleeps. The sound of "da-da-da-da" from the wind drills shattered the ancient valley. The focus of the engineering bureau also shifted from Xitongguan to Zhujiabu, downstream on the right bank, and then from Zhujiabu to Zijintan on the left bank.

    Zijintan originally had only one thatched cottage and a few poplar trees. But the workers built buildings there. When the buildings were completed, the concrete workers began pouring the first cubic meter of concrete for the dam.

    I worked in Zijintan and lived in Zhujiabu, so I had to cross the river every day. During the dry season, a pontoon bridge was built across the river. Compared to many large projects later, the pontoon bridge was really a drop in the bucket. However, at that time, seeing crowds of people and cars crowding on the pontoon bridge was quite a sight. People from the countryside came specifically to see the pontoon bridge, saying, "Hey! Who would have thought that people and cars could walk on the Xin'an River!"

    When the flood came, it snatched away the pontoon bridge. The boatman guarding the bridge jumped up in the dark of night, grabbed the bamboo cable wearing the pontoon bridge, and refused to let go. The pontoon bridge was swept away by the flood, and the boatman ran after it. He was bare-chested, not having had time to put on clothes, his body was scratched by the reeds and chaotic firewood on the beach, but he still didn't let go; he ran for several miles, quickly tied the bamboo cable to the railroad track, and finally saved the pontoon bridge.

    The river water rose, rose. The pontoon bridge could not be used, and the boat could not be rowed across. How could we cross? We used a landing craft! The landing craft was really a good thing, splitting through the raging waves and safely crossing the river.

    With the progress of the project, more and more people were traveling back and forth across the river. In the rainy season, floods often occurred, and the landing craft clearly could not solve the problem. The workers built a cable bridge near the dam. The high and long cable bridge, like several huge harps, tightened the strings. It quickly became the target of painters and poets, and quickly became the best viewing platform for tens of thousands of construction site visitors. One night, I was walking on the cable bridge when suddenly a group of visitors came running towards the cable bridge, one of whom, a woman, shouted, "I heard people say before that there was an iron cable bridge on the Xin'an River. I thought it would be difficult to walk on, but who knew it would be so spacious."

    Someone said, "Are you afraid? The bridge is shaking!"

    "No! Not at all. Look! The night view..."

    Indeed, watching the construction night view of the dam from the cable bridge was truly a feast for the eyes. Row upon row, layer upon layer, all lights. People come and go in the lights, looming, as if in a fairyland. Red and green indicator lights, dimming and brightening; silver-white arc lights, cutting through the morning sky. Thousands of lights, all reflected in the water, the light and water colors, particularly dazzling... I walked on the cable bridge hundreds of times, but I never tired of this charming night view.

    From the cable bridge, you could also see a more moving scene, that of heroes seizing the dragon. The heroes built the dam, only allowing the flood to flow through the three diversion bottom holes of the dam. The flood struggled and roared, spraying straight out of the diversion bottom holes, the water droplets splashed back, the spray soared into the sky, shattering thousands of jade plates, rolling up thousands of piles of snow, the big waves rolled and crashed directly on the cable bridge pillars, thousands of waves, each wave crashing to pieces...

    The opportunity to see this scene was rare. Soon, the heroes lowered each floodgate weighing more than three hundred tons, cutting off the Xin'an River that had been rushing for thousands of years.

    Before people had time to catch all the fish in the dry river pools, the first heavy-duty truck drove directly from Zijintan to Zhujiabu without any bridge. If you want to cross the river, just take off and run!

    Walking to the center of the river, I accidentally saw a snow-white smooth pebble. When I bent down to pick it up, I suddenly thought of Liang Dynasty Shen Yue's poem about the Xin'an River: "Transparent with the shallows, bright as a mirror without winter or spring,... Wouldn't it be better to ride away on this, overlooking the stony surface." There were also Tang Dynasty Liu Changqing's poems: "Imagine the Xin'an River, a lone traveler in a small boat, clear stream thousands of feet long, looking at white stones below." I never thought that these stony white stones had been lying at the bottom of the deep river for thousands of years; now, they can be picked up with a downward hand. However, after the hydropower station generates electricity, the river water will pass through the water turbine and flow downstream, and the stony white stones can only be seen reflecting on the river. Ah! Strolling across the river, this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

    One morning in April, the time was already seven thirty, and I hurried from Zhujiabu to Zijintan. Suddenly, the underwater road was interrupted, and a vast expanse of water was in front of me. Two or three melon-skin boats that had previously been idle on the beach were floating on the water again. It turned out that the first generator unit had been test-run the night before. I had no choice but to turn around and climb back up the right bank to cross the cable bridge again. That day, I was unexpectedly six or seven minutes late.

    The good news of the power generation of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station spread across the country like thunder, and hundreds of millions of people cheered for the successful power generation of China's first large-scale power station designed, surveyed, constructed, and equipped by ourselves!

    In just a few years, the changes in the Xin'an River have been too great! Just taking crossing the river as an example, there was taking a large ferry, crossing a pontoon bridge, sitting in a landing craft, walking a cable bridge, walking on the riverbed, and even crossing the top of the dam. Eleven years ago, who could have imagined that we could walk across the rushing, raging bottom of the Xin'an River on foot? Who could have imagined that a broad concrete avenue spanning the Xin'an River would appear more than one hundred meters in the air? This is a miracle, this is a dream; but under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, miracles are constantly appearing, and dreams have also become reality!

    Standing on top of the dam, I feel the world is exceptionally vast. Look! The towering iron towers, carrying high-voltage lines, send the current and the hearts of the Xin'an River people straight to Shanghai, straight to Hangzhou, straight to the countryside, countless machines are running, countless lights are emitting light!...

    We, the people of the Xin'an River, in order to have more high-altitude avenues appear in the ancient valleys of the motherland, in order to transport more power to the industry and agriculture of the motherland, we are willing to light that dim kerosene lamp again, to take that large awning boat in the rapids again, and to subdue the evil dragons again!

　　过江
　　李烈初
    我站在新安江水电站大坝之顶，看群山起伏万层，觉得天地格外广阔。坝前，是一望无际的烟波粼粼的人工湖；坝后，是一片崭新的城市，工厂如林。烟囱里冒出的烟柱，随着春风飘拂，紧映苍天……
    这一切，在地图上，还没来得及印上任何新的标志。三、四年前，这里，稀无人烟。只有一年一度喷火蒸霞的映山红花，在为原始的山谷，盖上红色的被服。
    这儿的变化多大呀！当我愉快地从右岸通过坝顶走向左岸的时候，不禁想起，以前，自己是怎样渡过新安江的？！
    1956年底，我们的施工队伍，还驻扎在右岸西铜官村——现在，西铜官已成了鱼的家乡，巨大的人工湖底。
    当时，西铜官点的是煤油灯；而东铜官，住着勘测总队，备有发电机，夜晚，灯火辉煌，还能看到电影。我们羡慕东铜官。但，从西铜官到东铜官得过渡。江面是极阔的。有一只大篷船，专门“伊哑，伊哑”地渡人。一船只能渡四、五十人，而渡一次得刻把钟。东、西铜官的码头上，都是一字长蛇阵，电影快开映了，心都急煞了！
    开始发洪水，渡船就得斜迎水势冲上去——那撑篙的，点住篙，用力撑，全身向前俯，渐渐地直扑在船板上，多么吃力呀！洪水大时，白浪滔天，势如万马奔腾，船只根本过不去，那就只好望江兴叹。
    洪水封住了渡船，却封不住我们建设水电站的决心。我们点起煤汽灯，扒开积雪，夜以继日地劈开山头，筑起公路，运来了发电机、压风机，工地成了不夜天，“哒哒哒哒”的风钻声，震破了古老的山谷。工程局的重心，也从西铜官移到右岸下游的朱家埠，又从朱家埠移到左岸的紫金滩。
    紫金滩，原先只有一间草房和几棵白杨树。工人们却在这片土地上建起了一幢幢大楼。当大楼落成时，浇捣工们已开始浇下了大坝的第一方混凝土。
    我在紫金滩办公，在朱家埠住宿，天天得过江。枯水季节，横江搭了一条浮桥。拿浮桥比起以后的许多大工程来，真是九牛一毛。可是，在当时，看到人群、汽车，在浮桥上拥来拥去，可真够味儿。农村里，有人特地跑来看浮桥，说道：“嗨！想不到新安江上也能走人、开汽车！”
    洪水来了，攫走了浮桥，护桥的船工，黑夜里跳起来，一把扯住穿着浮桥的竹索，死也不放。浮桥被洪水冲得飞跑，船工也跟着飞跑。他赤着膊，没来得及穿衣服，身体被沙滩上的芦苇、乱柴划破了，仍旧不放手；一直跑了几里路，把竹索迅速拴在铁轨上，终于保住了浮桥。
    江水，上涨，上涨。浮桥搭不住，船只摇不过。我们怎么过呢？就用登陆艇！登陆艇，可真是个好东西，劈破惊涛骇浪，安然渡江。
    随着工程的进展，往返过江的人越来越多。遇上雨季，经常发洪水，登陆艇显然解决不了问题。工人们就在大坝附近，造了一条缆索桥。又高又长的缆索桥，像几把极大的竖琴，拉紧了弦。它很快就成了画家和诗人们猎取的目标，很快就成了成千上万工地参观者的最好看台。一天夜里，我正在缆索桥上走，忽然有一群参观者熙熙攘攘地向缆索桥奔来，其中有个女的嚷道：“以前听人家讲，新安江有条铁索桥，我以为很难走，谁知竟是这么宽敞。”
    有人说：“你怕吗？桥在晃呢！”
    “不！一点也不怕。快瞧瞧！这夜景……”
    的确，在缆索桥上看拦河大坝的施工夜景，可真是饱享眼福。一排排，一层层，全是灯。人在灯光中出没，若隐若现，仿佛蓬莱仙境。红绿指示灯，忽暗忽亮；银白电弧光，划破晨空。千灯万灯，俱映入水里，灯光水色，格外眩目……。我在缆索桥上走了几百遍，却永远看不厌这迷人的夜景。
    在缆索桥上，还可以看到一个更为动人的镜头，那是英雄们卡住了蛟龙的镜头。英雄们筑起大坝，只准洪水在拦河大坝的三个导流底孔里流泻。洪水，挣扎着，咆哮着，从导流底孔里直喷出来，水珠倒溅，飞沫腾空，击碎万盘玉，卷起千堆雪，大浪滚滚，直撞在缆索桥柱上，千浪万浪，浪浪撞得粉碎……。
    能看到这一镜头的机会是难得的。不久，英雄们就放下了每扇重达三百多吨的截流闸门，拦腰斩断了奔腾千万年的新安江。
    人们还没有来得及捉完江面枯水潭里的鱼，第一辆载重汽车已不用任何桥梁，从紫金滩直开到朱家埠。你要过江，尽管撒开腿来跑吧！
    走到江中心，我偶然看到了一块雪白光滑的卵石，当我俯身拾起的时候，脑子里忽然想起了梁朝沈约咏新安江的诗句：“洞彻随清浅，皎镜无冬春，……岂若乘斯去，俯映石磷磷。”还有唐朝刘长卿的诗句：“想见新安江，扁舟一行客，清流数千丈，底下看白石”。想不到这磷磷白石，在深沉的江底躺了千万年；如今，竟可俯手拾取。可是，水电站发电后，江水便要通过水轮机，顺流而下，磷磷白石，又只能临江映见。啊！信步过江，这真是千载难逢的机会呀！
    4月里的一个早晨，时间已到七点半钟，我匆匆从朱家埠赶向紫金滩。突然，江底公路中断了，前面一片汪洋，两三艘原先闲置在沙滩上的瓜皮小艇，又在水面荡漾，原来是第一台发电机组，已在昨晚上试运转了。我只好回头爬上右岸，重新过缆索桥。这天，我意外地迟到了六、七分钟。
    新安江水电站发电的喜讯，像春雷般传遍全国，亿万人在为我国第一座自己设计、自己勘测、自己施工、自制设备的大型电站的胜利发电而欢呼！
    短短几年，新安江的变化实在太大了！光拿过江来说，就有乘大渡船、过浮桥、坐登陆艇、走缆索桥、江底步行，以至过大坝顶。十一年前，谁能想像，我们能够徒步走过奔腾暴跳的新安江底？谁能想像，会在一百多米的高空，出现横贯新安江的广阔的混凝土大道？这是奇迹，这是美梦；但在共产党和毛主席的领导下，奇迹迭出，美梦也变成了现实！
    我站在大坝之顶，觉得天地格外广阔，瞧！高耸入云的铁塔，架着高压线，把电流和新安江人的一片心意，直送到上海，直送到杭州，直送到农村，无数部机械在运转，无数盏电灯放出光明！……
    我们，新安江人，为了在祖国古老的山谷里，出现更多的高空大道，为了给祖国的工农业，输送更多的动力，我们愿意再去点燃那昏暗的煤油灯，再去乘那激流中的大篷船，再去制服恶蛟凶龙！
