Xinhua News Agency Report:

Anhui Province is doing a good job in summer field labor protection. Wherever there are large labor forces, shelters and boiled water supply stations are set up; wherever the labor production army goes, medical personnel follow; the labor army all have straw hats to wear, and each team and group has heatstroke prevention medicines, ensuring safe production during the hot season.

The characteristics of Anhui Province's summer field labor protection work this year are that the Party committee secretary takes the lead, grasps the work early and in detail, and relevant departments proceed from serving agricultural production in everything, contributing manpower and materials, thus making the summer field labor protection work well done. As early as the beginning of May, the heads of Party committees at all levels held meetings and made specific arrangements for summer field labor protection work in accordance with the spirit of caring for the masses' lives and combining work with rest. After the meeting, all localities immediately took action. Now, according to the characteristics of summer, the arrangement of labor and rest time is generally to start early and work late, making use of the cool time to work more, and rest more at noon. In order to ensure that the commune members have a place to rest and cool off and to ensure the supply of boiled water, shelters are generally built in places without shade; boiled water is delivered to places near villages, and boiled water is boiled on the spot in places far from villages, basically ensuring that no raw water is drunk. The Huaibei area also often boils mung bean soup for the commune members to drink. The pharmaceutical departments promptly transport Xiyang medicine such as Ten Drops Water, Rendan, Cooling Oil, and Chinese medicine such as licorice, honeysuckle, chrysanthemum, and mulberry leaves and other heatstroke prevention medicines to the countryside.

Medical departments at all levels organize large numbers of medical personnel to go to the mountains and the countryside to carry out mobile medical work. The Fuyang Special Zone alone has dispatched 15,000 Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, forming more than 1,900 mobile medical teams (groups) to carry out medical and health care work in the fields.

　　安徽注意暑季田间劳动保护
    据新华社讯　安徽省夏季田间劳动保护工作做得好。哪里有劳动大军，哪里就设凉棚和开水供应站；劳动生产大军到哪里，医务人员就跟到哪里；劳动大军都有草帽戴，队队、组组有防暑药品，保证酷暑季节安全生产。
    今年安徽省夏季田间劳动保护工作的特点，是党委书记挂帅，抓得早，抓得细，再加上有关部门从一切为农业生产服务出发，有人的出人，有物资的出物资，因而使夏季田间劳动保护工作做得好。早在5月初，各级党委负责人就召开会议，根据关心群众生活、劳逸结合的精神，对夏季田间劳动保护工作作了具体部署。会后，各地立即行动起来。现在，各地根据夏季特点，劳动和休息时间的安排，一般是起早赶晚，乘凉快时间多干，中午多休息。为了保证社员有休息乘凉的地方和保证开水供应，在没有树荫的地方，普遍建立凉棚；离村庄近的地方送开水，离村庄远的地方，就地烧开水，基本上做到不喝生水。淮北地区还经常烧绿豆汤给社员喝。医药部门把西药的十滴水、人丹、清凉油和中药的甘草、金银花、菊花、桑叶等防暑药品，及时运往农村。
    各级医疗部门组织大批医务人员上山下乡，开展巡回医疗工作。仅阜阳专区即抽调中西医一万五千名，组成一千九百多个巡回医疗队（组），到田间开展医疗保健工作。
