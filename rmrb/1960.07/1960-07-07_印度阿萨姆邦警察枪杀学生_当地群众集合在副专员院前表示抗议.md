Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 5th. According to the Press Trust of India, police in Guwahati, Assam, opened fire on a crowd yesterday morning, killing one student and injuring seven others. Subsequently, a 24-hour curfew was imposed in the area.

This is the first time that police have used gunfire to disperse crowds since the language agitation began in Assam.

The report said that the masses gathered in front of the Deputy Commissioner's bungalow to protest the shooting.

Currently, the agitation to make Assamese the state language is continuing throughout Assam. This movement has been opposed by some residents, mainly Bengali speakers, who wish to maintain the multilingual character of the state.

According to a 1951 survey, of Assam's total population of over nine million, 4.9 million spoke Assamese, 1.7 million spoke Bengali, and there were also speakers of Hindi and various other tribal languages.

    印度阿萨姆邦警察枪杀学生
    当地群众集合在副专员院前表示抗议
    新华社新德里5日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，昨天上午警察在阿萨姆邦的高哈蒂向群众开枪，造成一个学生死亡、另外七人受伤的事件。接着，当地实行了二十四小时的宵禁。
    自从阿萨姆邦发生语言鼓动运动以来，这是警察第一次用开枪的手段来驱散群众。
    报道说，群众集合在副专员平房院子的前面，抗议开枪。
    目前，要使阿萨姆语成为邦语的鼓动运动正在阿萨姆邦各地继续进行。这个运动遭到一部分居民、主要是讲孟加拉语居民的反对。他们希望保持这个邦的多种语言的特点。
    根据1951年的调查，阿萨姆邦在九百多万总人口中，有四百九十万人讲阿萨姆语，一百七十万人讲孟加拉语，此外还有讲印地语和其他各种部族语言的人。
