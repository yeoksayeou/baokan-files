　　Huaxin Cement Plant
　　Large Quantities of Cement Transferred Out
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan, 15th) Under the spirit of the entire nation acting as a coordinated chessboard and the slogan of producing and supplying whatever cement the country needs, the staff and workers of the Huaxin Cement Plant in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, have vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. They have tried every possible means to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and have focused on quality management. They have supplied large quantities of high-quality cement to ten provinces and regions, including Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Anhui, as well as twenty-two directly subordinate ministries and bureaus of the central government. This has powerfully supported national water conservancy construction and industrial and agricultural production.
    It is the common aspiration of the vast number of staff and workers of the Huaxin Cement Plant to send the best cement to the state's large-scale water conservancy projects and industrial and agricultural construction units. In the first half of this year, the Danjiangkou on the Han River and the Sanmenxia water conservancy hubs on the Yellow River needed a large amount of dam cement. This type of cement has strict technical requirements, and the plant had not produced it in batches before. However, in order to ensure the key projects, after careful research and experimentation, the quality of this cement fully met the needs of the construction units. In order to supply the slag cement needed for water conservancy projects throughout the country, the plant also signed contracts with Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Daye Steel Plant, Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant, and Huangshi Iron and Steel Plant to overcome various difficulties and transport a large amount of slag from these plants, solving the problem of insufficient raw materials. With the demand from all sides increasing greatly, the drying capacity could not keep up with the production needs. The plant adopted both indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs. On the one hand, it vigorously launched mass movements to quickly build more than twenty indigenous reverberatory furnaces to dry slag using local methods. On the other hand, under the leadership of the party committee secretary and the plant director, a special team was established to install three drying kilns, quickly increasing the plant's drying capacity from more than 400 tons per day to more than 1,000 tons, ensuring the normal production of slag cement.
    This year, in order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction, the plant's production tasks have increased, while the supply of semi-finished clinker is insufficient. Under these circumstances, in order to complete the production tasks and ensure that the quality of cement is not affected, the plant established sixty-eight control points from the mining of raw materials to the ex-factory delivery of cement. It adopted a method combining professional quality inspectors and production post workers to set up defenses at every stage and strictly strengthen quality management, not allowing a single ton of substandard cement to leave the factory. In this way, the plant's cement production in the first half of the year increased by 11.76 percent compared with the same period last year, and the quality reached or exceeded national requirements. At the same time, it also successfully tested ten new products, including No. 900 extra-fast-hardening cement, No. 1000 high-strength cement, and slag fast-hardening cement.

### 华新水泥厂　大批水泥外调

　　华新水泥厂
　　大批水泥外调
    本报武汉十五日电　湖北省黄石市华新水泥厂职工根据全国一盘棋的精神，在国家需要什么水泥就生产、供应什么水泥的口号下，大搞技术革新和技术革命，千方百计克服原材料不足的困难，狠抓质量管理，以大批质量优良的水泥供应了江西、广东、广西、湖北、湖南、河南、四川、贵州、安徽等十省区和中央二十二个直属部局，有力地支援了全国水利建设和工农业生产。
    把最好的水泥送给国家大型水利工程和工、农业建设单位，这是华新水泥厂广大职工的共同心愿。今年上半年，汉江丹江口和黄河三门峡水利枢纽需要大量的大坝水泥。这种水泥技术要求严格，过去这个厂没有成批生产过。但是，为了保证重点，经过认真的研究和试验，结果使这种水泥的质量全部合乎建设单位的需要。为了供给全国各地水利工程所需要的矿渣水泥，这个厂还和武汉钢铁公司、大冶钢厂、汉阳钢铁厂和黄石钢铁厂等单位签订了合同，克服了种种困难，从这些厂运回了大批的矿渣，解决了原材料不足的问题。在各方面需要量大大增加的情况下，出现了烤干能力赶不上生产需要的情况，这个厂又采取土洋并举、两条腿走路的方法，一方面大搞群众运动，迅速建起了二十多个土反射炉，用土法来烤干炉渣；另一方面，又在党委书记和厂长的领导下，建立了专门班子，安装了三台烤干窑，使全厂的烤干能力很快由日产四百多吨提高到一千多吨，保证了矿渣水泥的正常生产。
    今年来，这个厂为适应工、农业生产建设的需要，生产任务增大，而半成品熟料供应不足。在这种情况下，为完成生产任务，保证水泥质量不受影响，全厂从矿山的原材料开采到水泥出厂，建立了六十八个控制点，采取专业质量检查员和生产岗位工人相结合的办法，关关设防，严格加强质量管理，不让一吨质量不合规格的水泥出厂。这样，上半年内全厂生产的水泥比去年同期增长了百分之十一点七六，质量达到或超过了国家要求；同时，还试验成功了九百号特快硬水泥、一千号高强度水泥和矿渣快硬水泥等十种新产品。
