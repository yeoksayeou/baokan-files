Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Industrial departments in Hunan Province are organizing mobile repair teams for irrigation and drainage machinery, going deep into the countryside to vigorously repair irrigation and drainage machinery, supporting rural flood prevention and waterlogging drainage, and making early preparations for drought resistance.

　　Since the end of last year, the province has established 26 large repair centers, more than 2,000 medium and small repair stations, and more than 3,000 mobile repair teams. In the past six months, they have repaired more than 5,000 irrigation and drainage machines. However, the existing irrigation and drainage machinery in rural Hunan has suffered relatively serious wear and tear after last year's drought resistance struggle and long-term comprehensive utilization. In order to improve the efficiency of existing irrigation and drainage equipment, a mass movement centered on repairing irrigation and drainage machinery has been launched since the end of June. According to statistics from four special districts including Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Chenzhou, more than 4,000 mechanical workers have been transferred to form more than 150 mobile repair teams, going deep into the countryside to carry out a general inspection, review, and intensive repair movement of irrigation and drainage machinery. The Hanshou County Agricultural Machinery Factory has completed the major, medium, and minor repair tasks of 81 irrigation and drainage machines in a very short period of time.

　　This newspaper, Nanning, 16th: Workers of all ethnic groups on the industrial, transportation, and financial and trade fronts in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have launched a comprehensive upsurge in support of agriculture.

　　Workers in the machinery industry system of the entire region are taking the lead. All factories regard the manufacture and repair of agricultural machinery and tools and support for agricultural technical transformation as their central tasks. According to incomplete statistics, from January to mid-June, the region has completed 896 sets of various agricultural irrigation and drainage power equipment, totaling 21,515 horsepower, and completed more than 330,000 transplanters.

　　By the beginning of June, the vast number of workers on the financial and trade front in the region had prepared more than 15 million pieces of various bamboo, wood, and iron farm tools, and the agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery urgently needed for drought resistance were supplied in a timely manner. Financial and trade personnel in the Baise Special District have trained 1,200 farm tool repair personnel for various communes and brigades, and repaired more than 20,000 farm tools. Workers on the highway, shipping, and civil aviation transportation fronts in the region are doing everything possible to ensure the transportation of agricultural materials. According to June statistics alone, the region's transportation volume of agricultural machinery, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation and drainage machinery, etc., in support of drought resistance reached more than one million tons, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

　　This newspaper, Kunming, 16th: The industrial departments of Yunnan Province are vigorously supporting agriculture. In the past six months, various irrigation and drainage, agricultural product processing machinery, farming equipment, and transportation tools manufactured for agriculture and submitted for use by the communes are equivalent to saving 1.2 million laborers for the countryside.

　　This spring, according to the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee's policy of "mainly semi-mechanization, without relaxing mechanization in certain areas and certain production links, and vigorously carrying out tool reform to liberate two million rural laborers," various factories and mining enterprises in Yunnan Province vigorously manufactured various agricultural machinery such as irrigation and drainage machinery. As of the end of June, more than 570 gas engines of various models have been produced, totaling more than 20,000 horsepower, equivalent to the sum of various power irrigation and drainage machinery such as gas electric motors manufactured and existing in the past ten years. On average, each of these gas engines can guarantee the supply of water for planting rice and seedlings on about 1,000 mu of farmland. More than 1,000 irrigation and drainage machines in the province have enabled more than one million mu of paddy fields to be planted in a timely manner. Moreover, gas engines alone have saved more than 250,000 laborers for the countryside.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: The industrial front of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has adopted the method of contracting areas, contracting tasks, and contracting to the end, vigorously supporting agricultural production and the current summer harvest.

　　In order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, under the unified leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, this year, various industrial and mining enterprises in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have transferred more than 1,000 cadres (including some department and bureau leading cadres) to go deep into the communes they are contracted to, participate in production, and lead production. In the first half of this year, various factories and mines promptly supplied more than 10,000 sets of large-scale agricultural machinery such as double-wheeled double-share plows and walking plows to various people's communes. In addition, they also supported more than 80,000 pieces of general agricultural machinery and sent technicians to help people's communes repair nearly 100,000 pieces of farm tools. This year, the various horse-drawn harvesters supported by the industrial and transportation departments of the Autonomous Region to the people's communes are equivalent to twice the total number in the past few years. In April, in accordance with the principle of large factories contracting large communes and several medium and small factories cooperating to contract one commune, short-term contracting has developed into long-term contracting; the content of the contracting ranges from sowing to grain storage, from organization and management, mechanical installation and maintenance to farmland capital construction, contracting area, and contracting output. At present, more than 700 enterprises above the county level in the Autonomous Region have established this kind of contracting relationship with people's communes. This contracting method has far exceeded the original relationship of simply providing equipment, technology, and manpower support, making workers in industrial and transportation departments regard supporting agriculture as an important task of their own.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa: Handicraft industries in various parts of Tibet are doing everything possible to serve agricultural production and are warmly welcomed by the vast number of emancipated peasants.

　　Now, with the help of local state-owned trading companies and the People's Bank, handicraftsmen in various towns such as Lhasa, Xigaze, Gyangze, Qamdo, and Nyingchi have generally organized mutual aid groups, and production has been greatly developed. In the first and second quarters of this year, more than 140 handicraft mutual aid groups in Lhasa City supplied a total of 7,964 pieces of shovels, pickaxes, hoes, sickles, Tibetan plows, etc. to various counties in the Lhasa area. Blacksmiths and carpenters scattered in the vast rural areas are also organized to repair farm tools for agricultural production mutual aid groups and collect waste copper and scrap iron in rural areas to process and manufacture new farm tools to meet the needs of peasants.

　　At present, handicraftsmen in Tibet are rushing to manufacture a large number of sickles, shovels, and wooden wheat winnowers, ear-cutting machines, threshing machines, and other autumn harvest threshing equipment to welcome this year's bumper agricultural harvest.

　　湖南广西突击制造修配排灌机械
　  云南新疆西藏抓紧运送农具下乡
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省工业部门组织排灌机械修理流动小组，深入农村，突击检修排灌机械，支援农村防汛、排渍，并提前作好抗旱准备。
    这个省去年年底建立的大修中心厂二十六个，中、小修理站二千多个，流动修理小组三千多个，半年来，已抢修排灌机械五千多台。但是，湖南农村现有的排灌机械经过去年抗旱斗争，和长期的综合利用，机器的磨损较为严重。为提高现有排灌设备的效率，从6月下旬起，又掀起了以修理排灌机械为中心的群众运动。据湘潭、衡阳、郴州等四个专区统计，已抽调四千多名机械工人，组成一百五十多个流动修理小组，深入农村，开展了排灌机械普检、复查和突击检修运动。汉寿县农业机械厂在很短的时间内，已完成八十一台排灌机械的大、中、小修任务。
    本报南宁16日电　广西僮族自治区工业、交通运输、财贸等战线各族职工掀起了全面支援农业热潮。
    全区机械工业系统职工，一马当先，各厂都把制造和修配农业机械、农具，支援农业技术改造当作中心任务。据不完全统计，1至6月中旬，全区已完成各种农业排灌动力八百九十六台，共二万一千五百一十五马力，完成插秧机三十三万多架。
    全区财贸战线广大职工到6月上旬已准备了各种竹木铁农具一千五百多万件，抗旱急需的农业排灌机具，都及时供应。百色专区深入田间的财贸人员，已经为各公社、大队培训了一千二百名修理农具人员，修理农具二万多件。全区公路、航运、民用航空交通运输战线职工，千方百计保证农业物资运输。仅6月份统计，全区支援抗旱的农械、种子、肥料、农药、排灌机具等的运量，即达一百多万吨，有力地支援了农业生产。
    本报昆明16日电　云南省工业部门大力支援农业，半年来，为农业制造并已提交公社使用的各种排灌、农产品加工机械、耕作机具和运输工具，相等于为农村节约了一百二十万个劳动力。
    今年春天，云南省各厂矿企业根据中共云南省委“以半机械化为主，不放松某些地区和某些生产环节的机械化，大搞工具改革。解放二百万农村劳动力”的方针，大力制造排灌机械等各种农业机械。截至6月底止，已生产了五百七十多台各种型号的煤气机，共计二万多马力，相当于过去十年中制造的和原有的煤气电动等各种动力排灌机械的总和。这些煤气机平均每台可以保证供给一千亩左右的农田栽插水和保苗水，全省一千多台排灌机械，使一百多万亩水田得到了及时的栽插。而且，单煤气机一项就为农村节约了二十五万多个劳动力。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区工业战线采取包地区、包任务、一包到底的办法，大力支援农业生产和当前夏收。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各工矿企业为了贯彻以农业为基础的方针，在自治区党委统一领导下，今年已抽调出一千多名干部（包括部分厅、局领导干部），深入到所包干的公社，参加生产，领导生产。今年上半年各厂矿及时向各人民公社供应了双轮双铧犁、步犁等大型农业机械一万多部，另外还支援一般农业机具八万多件，派技术工人帮助人民公社修理农具近十万件。今年，自治区工业交通部门支援人民公社的各式马拉收割机，相当于过去几年总数的两倍。4月间，各厂矿按照大厂包大社，几家中、小型厂协作包一个社的原则，由短期包干发展为长期包干；包干的内容从播种到粮食入库，从组织管理、机械安装维修到农田基本建设，包面积，包产量。目前，自治区已有县以上的七百多个企业与人民公社建立了这种包干关系。这种包干办法，已远远超过了原来单纯的器材、技术、人力支援的关系，使工业交通部门职工把支援农业当作自己一项重要任务。
    据新华社拉萨讯　西藏各地的手工业千方百计地为农业生产服务，受到广大翻身农民的热烈欢迎。
    现在，拉萨、日喀则、江孜、昌都、林芝等各城镇的手工业者，在当地国营贸易公司和人民银行的帮助下已经普遍组织起互助组，生产得到了很大发展。拉萨市的一百四十多个手工业互助组，在今年一、二季度中，向拉萨地区各县供应了铁锹、十字镐、锄头、镰刀、藏式犁等共七千九百六十四件。分散在广大农村的铁匠和木匠，也组织起来，给农业生产互助组修补农具，并收集农村的废铜烂铁，加工打制新农具，满足农民的需要。
    目前，西藏的手工业者正在赶制大批镰刀、铁锹和木制的扬麦机、切穗机、脱粒机等秋收打场用具，迎接今年的农业丰收。
