To the Flowing Waves of the Congo River
Zou Difan

Congo River, can you hear the black children singing songs of love for you?
"On the banks of the Congo River, I build my hut, soothed to sleep by the murmuring waves."
Eighty years of struggle, eighty years of blood flowing into the river,
A round red sun shines for the first time on the waves of the Congo,
A bay of river water flows like honey...
You are only eight days old,
And imperialism is already sharpening its swords on your riverbanks.
They are not reconciled to their defeat,
Nor are they willing to listen to your songs of victory.
We have long learned their old tricks—
 To divide a complete country into two,
 Then comes paratroopers, landing craft,
 And holding a broken pipa to half-cover their face
  —under the guise of the United Nations.
Congo River, stir up your waves of resistance!
The old slave traders were long ago beaten bloody,
How can we let the Belgian wolves and American tigers haggle over the division of the Republic of the Congo?
People of the Congo River,
The rolling waves sing you marching songs.
Throw stones at the Belgian paratroopers,
This is the imperialism’s poisonous bacteria,
It should be shot down!
Use sticks to scatter the "Wasps,"
 Don't let them fly near the flowers of the Congo!
The Congo is an independent country,
The people are the country's police!
Pick up sticks to direct traffic,
Pick up weapons to resist aggression.
Let all the imperialist jackals get out of the Congo!
All friendly eyes are watching the flowers on your equator...
(Negro poet Hughes' line)
(After the Congo incident, the U.S. immediately sailed the aircraft carrier Wasp close to the Congo.)

    给刚果河的流波
    邹荻帆刚果河，你可听着黑色儿女唱恋你的
  歌？“在刚果河畔我搭起茅屋，抚我入睡的是潺潺流波。”?八十多年的斗争，八十多年血流成河，一轮红日初照刚果的流波，一湾河水像蜂蜜般流过……你出生才不过八天啊，帝国主义又在你河边把剑磨。他们不甘心自己的失败，也不愿洗耳听你们胜利的歌。他们的老一套我们早已领教过——
  把完整的国家分裂成两
    个，
  然后是伞兵、登陆艇，
  还抱一把破琵琶半遮面
    ——打着招牌联合国。刚果河，掀起你反抗的大波！贩卖奴隶的老早被打得血流皮
  破，怎能让比利时狼和美利坚虎讲价还价把刚果共和国分割？刚果河畔的人民啊，滚滚的流波为你们唱进军歌。向比利时伞兵投石子，这是帝国主义的毒菌呀，应该
  被击落！用棍棒打散“黄蜂”，?不准他们飞近刚果的花朵！刚果是独立的国家，人民就是国家的警察！拿起棒子指挥交通，拿起武器反抗侵略。一切帝国主义豺狼从刚果滚出
  去！一切友谊的眼睛注视着你赤道
  上的鲜花……?黑人诗人休士句。?刚果事件发生后，美帝立即将黄蜂号航空母舰驶近刚果。
