Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Washington Dispatch: Soviet Premier Khrushchev's remarks on the 9th, stating that the Soviet Union would resolutely support the Cuban people if foreign armed forces intervened in Cuba, have shaken the Washington ruling clique, which is plotting to intensify interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

It is reported that U.S. President Eisenhower, currently on vacation in Rhode Island, held several phone conversations with Secretary of State Herter in Washington regarding this matter. Eisenhower later issued an arrogant and unreasonable statement, declaring that the United States' plot to interfere in Cuba remains unchanged.

In the statement, Eisenhower acted as if he were the master of the Western Hemisphere, continuing to regard the Western Hemisphere as the world ruled by the United States. He said that Khrushchev's stern warning against U.S. imperialism "reflects an effort by an outside nation and international communism to interfere in the internal affairs of the Western Hemisphere." He also reiterated the excuse made for interfering in the internal affairs of many countries and stifling the independence of many countries, saying that the United States "will not allow" the establishment in the Western Hemisphere of what he called "a regime controlled by the international communist movement." Eisenhower's statement also said that Khrushchev's remarks pointed out "the close ties established between the Soviet government and the Cuban government."

Eisenhower indicated that the United States would continue to use a series of treaties it had cobbled together in Latin America to intensify its planning for intervention in Cuba. He clamored that the United States "is obligated to uphold" a series of agreements starting with the Rio Treaty. He said, "I strongly reiterate that the United States will not fail to fulfill its responsibilities because of Mr. Khrushchev's threats." White House Press Secretary Hagerty later explained that the agreements Eisenhower referred to included the 1947 Rio Treaty, the 1948 treaty establishing the Organization of American States, and the 1954 Caracas Declaration, all notorious treaties used by the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries.

Recently, U.S. interference in Cuba has intensified, and calls for intervention in Cuba within the United States have become increasingly loud. On the 5th, the U.S. government announced the suspension of Cuban sugar imports to put pressure on Cuba. On the same day, the U.S. government also sent a threatening note to Cuba regarding the Cuban government's takeover of the facilities of the U.S. Texaco oil company in Cuba. Today's issue of "Newsweek," the mouthpiece of the U.S. monopoly capital group, even clamored in naked imperialist robber language that "Cuba, this small island, was liberated by the United States from Spanish tyranny, and it can be taken back in a U.S. Marine Corps exercise." It clamored that the United States should "sharpen its weapons" to deal with Cuba.

### 艾森豪威尔就赫鲁晓夫谈话发表声明　美国坚持要干涉古巴

　　艾森豪威尔就赫鲁晓夫谈话发表声明
　　美国坚持要干涉古巴
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9日发表的关于如果一旦外国武装干涉古巴，苏联将给古巴人民以坚决支持的谈话，震动了正在策划加紧干涉古巴内政的华盛顿统治集团。
    据报道，目前正在罗得岛休假的美国总统艾森豪威尔当天特为此事同在华盛顿的国务卿赫脱进行了好几次电话联系。艾森豪威尔在后来发表的一项蛮横无理的声明中，扬言美国干涉古巴的阴谋保持不变。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中俨然以西半球的主子自居，继续把西半球视为美国统治的天下。他说什么赫鲁晓夫对美帝国主义的义正词严的警告“反映了一个外来国家和国际共产主义干涉西半球内政的努力”。他并且重申为干涉许多国家内政、扼杀许多国家的独立而制造的借口说，美国“不会容许”在西半球建立一个他所谓的“由国际共产主义运动控制的政权”。艾森豪威尔的声明还说，赫鲁晓夫的谈话指出了
  “苏联政府和古巴政府之间建立起来的紧密联系”。
    艾森豪威尔表示，美国要继续利用它在拉丁美洲拼凑的一系列条约来加紧策划对古巴的干涉。他叫嚷说，美国“有义务坚守”从里约热内卢公约开始的一系列协定。他说“我强烈地重申，美国将不会由于赫鲁晓夫先生的威胁而不履行它的责任。”据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂后来解释，艾森豪威尔所说的这些协议包括1947年的里约热内卢公约、1948年的建立美洲国家组织的条约和1954年的加拉加斯协定这些臭名远扬的美国用来干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的条约。
    最近以来，美国干涉古巴的活动变本加厉，美国国内干涉古巴的叫嚷甚嚣尘上。美国政府5日宣布停止古巴食糖进口以向古巴施加压力。同一天，美国政府还就古巴政府接收美国德士古石油公司在古巴的厂房设备一事向古巴提出威胁性照会。今天出版的美国垄断资本集团的喉舌“新闻周刊”更以赤裸裸的帝国主义强盗语言叫嚷说，“古巴这个小岛是美国从西班牙暴政下解放出来的，在美国海军陆战队的一次演习中就可以把它拿回来。”它叫嚷美国要“磨锐武器”来对付古巴。
