Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 14th: The Daye Steel Plant has established mass quality supervisors, combining mass supervision with professional supervision, forming a factory-wide quality supervision network, and ensuring the continuous improvement of product quality.

The Daye Steel Plant's launch of mass quality supervision activities began in February 1959. At that time, due to the continuous leap forward in production, new problems arose where quality management work could not keep up with the development of production. In order to find the right way to solve this problem, the factory's Party Committee organized relevant department personnel to conduct free airing and debates. During the debate, some people requested the addition of professional quality supervisors to strengthen quality management work, while most people disagreed with this view, believing that relying solely on professional personnel without mobilizing the masses would make it impossible to do a good job in quality management. After the debate, everyone unanimously agreed that it was necessary to "everyone cares about quality, every checkpoint sets up mass supervision, focusing on prevention, and not letting defective products leave the gate." Thus, with professional supervisors as the backbone, mass quality supervision activities were vigorously launched. Throughout the factory, from the entry of raw materials to the exit of finished products, mass quality supervisors were universally established, forming a quality supervision network combining professional supervisors and mass supervisors.

The specific practice of combining professional quality supervisors and mass quality supervisors is as follows: In addition to retaining the original professional quality supervision stations in each workshop, each production shift selects several mass supervisors to form a quality supervision group together with the professional quality supervisors. The professional supervisor serves as the leader of the group, and one of the mass supervisors is selected to serve as the deputy leader. Under the leadership of the workshop Party branch, they carry out quality supervision activities. Professional supervisors provide guidance in business, and mass supervisors are responsible for maintaining the implementation of procedures and ensuring product quality in production. In order to better ensure product quality, they have also established a system of pre-shift arrangements, mid-shift inspections, and post-shift summaries. Before the pre-shift meeting, the supervision group, according to the requirements of the production plan, clearly puts forward key quality issues and specific measures, which are implemented through the production foreman. Mass supervisors in the shift do diligent observation, diligent communication, and diligent inspection, and promptly put forward opinions to the production foreman for handling when they find general problems, and promptly report major problems to the professional supervisor, adopting a method of combining the shift leader, professional quality supervisor, and mass supervisor to jointly study and handle them. They also conduct summaries after the shift to commend advanced individuals, point out shortcomings, and exchange experiences to improve the business capabilities and management level of mass quality supervisors.

After the factory launched mass quality supervision activities, it changed the past tendency of professional supervisors only managing quality and not production, and production workers focusing on output and not paying much attention to quality, and everyone established the view of equal emphasis on output and quality, and overall leap forward. Through mass quality supervision activities, a new situation has been formed in the factory where everyone cares about quality. From January to June of this year, the factory has put forward a total of 1,785 suggestions for improving quality, prevented 576 accidents, saved 126 furnaces of products, and reformed 35 supervision tools, effectively promoting the improvement of product quality.

After the launch of mass quality supervision activities, the workers' business capabilities and management level have been greatly improved. Since last year, through professional supervisors widely making friends with workers, constantly conducting business guidance, and adopting methods such as short-term rotation training, a total of 555 mass quality supervisors have been trained and developed. In this way, although a large number of new equipment has been put into production in this factory in the past two years, and the output of steel and steel products has increased 45 times, and the number of professional supervisors has been reduced by more than 14％ compared with the original, the product quality is still continuously improving. According to statistics from the first half of this year, the qualified rate of open-hearth high-quality steel increased by 0.17％ compared with the same period last year, and the qualified rate of electric furnace steel has always remained above 97％; the qualified rate of forgings reached 99.993％, an increase of 0.09％ compared with the same period last year, and the qualified rate of rolled steel increased by 2.78％ compared with the same period last year.

### 开展群众性质量监督活动人人树立全面跃进观点　大冶钢厂钢材质量不断提高

　　开展群众性质量监督活动人人树立全面跃进观点
　　大冶钢厂钢材质量不断提高
    新华社武汉14日电　大冶钢厂设立群众质量监督员，使群众监督和专业监督相结合，形成了全厂质量监督网，保证了产品质量的不断提高。
    大冶钢厂开展群众性质量监督活动，是从1959年2月间开始的。当时由于生产不断跃进，出现了质量管理工作跟不上生产发展的新问题。这个厂的党委为了找到解决这个问题的正确方法，便组织有关科室人员开展鸣放辩论。辩论中，一部分人要求增加专业质量监督员来加强质量管理工作，大多数人不同意这种主张，认为单纯依靠专业人员而不发动群众，就不可能搞好质量管理工作。经过辩论，大家一致认为，必须“人人关心质量，关关设群众监督，以预防为主，不让废品出大门”，于是以专业监督人员为骨干，大力开展了群众性的质量监督活动。全厂从原料材料进厂到成品出厂，普遍设立了群众质量监督员，形成了一个专业监督人员和群众监督人员相结合的质量监督网。
    专业质量监督员和群众质量监督员相结合的具体作法是：各车间除保留原有的专业质量监督站以外，每个生产班次都由群众选出若干个群众监督员，跟专业质量监督员一起，组成一个质量监督小组，由专业监督员担任组长，群众监督员选一人担任副组长。他们在车间党支部的领导下，开展质量监督活动。专业监督员在业务上进行辅导，群众监督员在生产中负责维护规程的贯彻和保证产品质量。为了更好的保证产品质量，他们还建立了班前布置、班中检查、班后总结的制度。举行班前会以前，监督小组根据生产计划的要求，明确提出质量关键问题和具体措施，通过生产班长布置执行。群众监督员在班中做到勤看、勤说、勤检查，发现一般问题及时向生产班长提出处理意见，发现重大问题随时向专业监督员汇报，采取值班长、专业质量监督员和群众监督员三结合的方法共同研究处理。他们在班后还要进行总结，表扬先进，指出缺点，交流经验，以提高群众质量监督员的业务能力和管理水平。
    这个厂开展群众性质量监督活动以后，改变了过去专业监督人员只管质量不管生产，生产工人偏重产量不大关心质量的偏向，人人树立了产量质量并重、全面跃进的观点。通过群众性质量监督活动，全厂已经形成一个人人关心质量的新局面。从今年1月到6月，全厂共提出改进质量的建议一千七百八十五条，防止事故五百七十六起，挽救产品一百二十六炉，改革监督工具三十五件，有效地促进了产品质量的提高。
    群众性质量监督活动开展起来以后，大大提高了工人的业务能力和管理水平。去年以来，通过专业监督员在工人中广泛交知心朋友，经常不断地进行业务辅导，并采取短期轮训等办法，培养和发展了群众质量监督员共五百五十五人。这样，尽管这个厂两年来新设备大量投入生产，钢和钢材的产量提高四十五倍，专业监督人员又比原来减少14％以上，但产品质量仍在不断提高。据今年上半年的统计，平炉优质钢合格率比去年同期提高0.17％，电炉钢的合格率始终保持在97％以上；锻材合格率达99.993％，比去年同期提高0.09％，轧材合格率比去年同期提高了2.78％。
