    Study Mao Zedong Thought: Be Resourceful, Energetic, and Courageous
    Ma Xueli, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, I have often thought that our country has experienced many social changes since liberation. Each social change has propelled our country forward a big step. Isn't this all because of the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought? In every period, Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out a clear direction for us. As long as we act according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, we will surely be victorious. It's like a big ship with a good helmsman, who will never lose direction and will always brave the wind and waves to move forward!

    The call by the Hubei Provincial Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch a campaign to study Mao Zedong's works has really struck a chord with me. I thought, if we all learn to master Mao Zedong Thought, wouldn't we be even more energetic and resourceful in production and innovation? I discussed it with some advanced producers from the province and city, and decided to take the lead in responding to the Party's call and propose a movement to study Mao Zedong's works among the workers.

    The first thing I read was "On Practice," and then I studied "On Contradiction." Not long ago, I also listened to a tutoring report on "On Contradiction" at the factory. In the middle of studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," I recalled my past situation in engaging in production and innovation.

    In 1958, our factory's production increased several times. As a result, a part called "worm gear," which was processed in our workshop, became increasingly in short supply and became the key to the entire factory. Under the leadership of the Party branch, I worked with the masses of workers, and after many experiments, we successfully created a new tool called "external whirlwind milling," which increased efficiency twelvefold and met the assembly's need for worm gears. However, in March 1959, the factory's production leaped forward again, and "external whirlwind milling" could no longer meet production needs. At this time, I proposed the innovative suggestion of reciprocating cutting, which doubled production efficiency again. The Party organization and comrades encouraged me, saying that this was the embodiment of the spirit of continuous revolution. After studying "On Contradiction" this time, I had a deeper and more thorough understanding of this matter. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Contradiction is universal and absolute, existing in all processes of the development of things, and runs through the entire process from beginning to end." He also said: "The old process is over, and the new process has occurred. The new process also contains new contradictions and begins its own history of contradictory development." In the summer of 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward in production throughout the factory, and we were still using the old methods to process worm gears, this created a contradiction. Under the specific guidance of the Party organization, we discovered this contradiction, solved this contradiction with technological innovation, and met the production requirements at that time. However, in 1959, production developed again, and the supply of worm gears became a problem again, which created a new contradiction. Only by discovering and solving these contradictions in a timely manner and continuously carrying out technological innovation can we achieve sustained leaps forward. Comrade Mao Zedong's works helped us summarize our practical experience, raise it to the level of theory, and then use it to guide our production practice. At this time, it's really like what the workers in our workshop said: "A red heart, bright eyes, and skillful hands." With a bright heart, there are more ways. Let's talk about this "external whirlwind milling" again! This year, our factory's production has doubled again. I thought that if the efficiency of worm gear processing is not further improved, it will become a problem again. So I took the initiative to study with everyone and successfully tested the method of clamping two parts at a time, which once again improved processing efficiency. Now, my idea is that the efficiency of worm gear processing will definitely be further improved in the future, because the development and changes of things are endless. And as long as we master Mao Zedong Thought, we can correctly understand the constantly developing objective things, make our thinking conform to the laws of the development of objective things, and on this basis give play to people's subjective initiative, we can constantly transform objective things. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "The philosophy of Marxism regards a very important question, not in understanding the laws of the objective world, and thus being able to explain the world, but in using this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world."

    Comrade Mao Zedong told us in "On Practice" that all knowledge comes from practice. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "No matter who wants to understand something, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." He also said: "The Chinese have an old saying: 'How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?' This sentence is true for people's practice, and it is also true for epistemology." These words have given us the most powerful ideological weapon. This time, in the march towards mechanization and automation, I worked with planers and electricians to create an automatic stop device for gantry planers, which can improve the mechanization of machine tools, improve production efficiency, implement multi-machine tool management, and save labor. On the day the automatic stop device was successfully tested, a planer asked me: "Master Ma, what if the tool breaks in the middle and no one is around? What should we do?" This question stumped me. I hadn't considered this issue. I was stunned for a while, then raised my head and replied: "As long as we all use our brains, this problem can be solved." The planer then said: "I don't think this problem can be solved." At this time, I remembered Comrade Mao Zedong's saying that all knowledge comes from practice, and firmly replied to him: "You say it's impossible because we haven't used our brains yet, and we haven't done it yet." Later, I consulted all the planers and electricians, and asked everyone to think of solutions. For days, people came to me from time to time, telling me their new plans. After repeated experiments, we finally solved this problem: an electrical device was installed near the tool head, and if the tool broke in the middle, the machine tool would automatically stop and send out a signal. It was under the encouragement of the spirit of "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den" that Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of that we achieved one victory after another in technological innovation and technological revolution. The workers of the small parts workshop in just one workshop proposed more than two hundred innovative suggestions in one month and implemented more than ninety of them. Recently, we have also broken through a cutting-edge technology and successfully tested the lathe "program control instrument."

    Our factory's production is very busy, and we have to squeeze out time for innovation. Some comrades believe that under these circumstances, there is no time to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and it is impossible to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works well. My view is just the opposite. From my own study and work, I have realized that the busier we are with production and innovation, the more we must study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work. The busier we are with production and innovation, the more we have the conditions to study Chairman Mao's works well. Because only in continuous practice can we deepen our understanding and comprehension of Mao Zedong Thought step by step. I think it is difficult for people who have no social practice and production practice to truly learn Mao Zedong Thought well. I myself feel that the busier I am, the more I want to read Comrade Mao Zedong's works. In addition to trying every means to use my spare time, I also seize the time to read on trains and ships. "On Practice" was gradually read on the ferry. I also try to use the time before and after meetings, even if I can only read one or two paragraphs, I must continue to read them without interruption.

### 学习毛泽东思想，智多、劲大、有胆量

    学习毛泽东思想，智多、劲大、有胆量
    武汉重型机床厂　马学礼
    1958年大跃进以来，我常常想，解放这些年来，我们的国家经历了许多社会变革，每一次社会变革都推动我们的国家向前发展一大步，这不都是因为有毛泽东思想作指导吗？在每一个时期里，毛泽东同志都给我们指出了明确的方向。我们只要照毛泽东同志的指示办事，就一定能够胜利。这好像是一只大船，有了一个好舵手，就永远不会迷失方向，永远乘风破浪地向前进！
    中共湖北省委和武汉市委发出了开展学习毛泽东著作运动的号召，正说到了我的心里。我想，要是我们都学会掌握了毛泽东思想，搞生产闹革新不就劲头更足、办法更多了吗？我和省、市的一些先进生产者商量一下，决定带头响应党的号召，倡议在职工中开展一个学习毛泽东著作运动。
    我最先读的是《实践论》，接着又学习《矛盾论》。前不久，在厂里又听了一个关于《矛盾论》的学习辅导报告。在学习《实践论》与《矛盾论》中间，我回想起自己过去搞生产闹革新的情形。
    1958年，我们厂的生产翻了几番。这样一来，我们工部里加工的一种零件“蜗杆”，就愈来愈供不应求，成了全厂的关键。在党支部的领导下，我就和工人群众一起，经过多次的试验，创造成功了一种叫作“外旋风铣”的新工具，一下子提高效率十二倍，满足了装配对蜗杆的需要。可是，到了1959年3月间工厂的生产又向前跃进了，“外旋风铣”也不能满足生产需要了。这时，我又提出了往返吃刀的革新建议，把生产效率又提高了一倍。党组织和同志们鼓励我，说这是不断革命精神的体现。这次学习了《矛盾论》，我对这件事才有了较深刻、较彻底的认识。毛泽东同志说：“矛盾是普遍的、绝对的，存在于事物发展的一切过程中，又贯串于一切过程的始终。”又说：“旧过程完结了，新过程发生了。新过程又包含着新矛盾，开始它自己的矛盾发展史。”1958年夏天的时候，由于全厂生产大跃进而我们加工蜗杆仍然用的老办法，这就产生了矛盾。在党组织的具体指引下，我们发现这个矛盾，用技术革新的方法，解决了这个矛盾，满足了当时生产的要求。可是，到了1959年，生产又向前发展，蜗杆的供应又成了问题，这就产生了新的矛盾。只有及时发现和解决这些矛盾，不断地进行技术革新，才能实现持续跃进。毛泽东同志的著作，帮助我们总结了自己实践的经验，把它提高到理论上来，再去指导我们的生产实践。在这时，真像我们车间的工人说的：“心红眼亮手巧”。心里亮了，办法也更多了。还是说这个“外旋风铣”吧！到了今年，我们全厂的生产又翻了一番。我就想到蜗杆的加工，如果不进一步提高效率，又要成问题了。就主动地和大家一起研究，又试验成功了一次卡两个活的办法，再一次地提高了加工效率。现在，我的想法是加工蜗杆的效率，将来还一定会进一步提高，因为事物的发展、变化是没有止境的。而我们只要掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以正确地认识不断发展着的客观事物，使我们思想符合于客观事物发展的规律，在这个基础上发挥人的主观能动作用，就能够不断地改造客观事物。这也就是毛泽东同志在《实践论》中所说的：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”
    毛泽东同志在《实践论》中告诉我们，一切知识都是从实践中来的。毛泽东同志说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”他又说：“中国人有一句老话：‘不入虎穴，焉得虎子。’这句话对于人们的实践是真理，对于认识论也是真理。”这些话给了我们最有力的思想武器。这次在向机械化、自动化进军中，我和刨工、电工一起制成了龙门刨床的自动停刀装置，可以提高机床的机械化程度，提高生产效率，又可以实行多机床管理，节约劳动力。自动停刀装置试验成功的那天，有一个刨工问我：“马师傅，要是中途刀坏了，人不在，怎么办呢？”这一下把我问住了，我没有考虑到这个问题。我怔了一会，抬起头来回答道：“只要我们大家动脑子，这个问题可以解决。”那个刨工紧接着说：“我看这个问题不可能解决。”这时，我想起了毛泽东同志说的一切知识都是从实践中得来的道理，就坚定地回答他说：“你说不可能，是因为我们还没有动脑筋，还没有动手做。”后来，我就向所有的刨工、电工请教，请大家都来想办法，几天里，时刻有人来找我，说出他们的新方案。经过一再试验，终于解决了这个问题：在刀头附近安一个电器装置，中途刀坏了，机床便自动停刀，并发出信号。就是在毛主席说的“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”的精神鼓舞下，我们在技术革新和技术革命中取得了一个接一个胜利。仅一车间中小件工部的职工，一个月里就提出了二百多项革新建议，实现了九十多项。最近我们又攻破了一项尖端技术，试验成功了车床“程序控制仪”。
    我们工厂的生产很忙，又要挤出时间来闹革新。有的同志认为在这种情况下，没有时间学习毛泽东同志的著作，不可能学好毛泽东同志的著作。我的看法恰好相反。我从自己的学习与工作中体会到，生产和革新越忙，就越要学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导我们的工作。生产与革新越忙，就越有条件学好毛主席著作。因为我们只有在不断的实践中，才能一步步地加深对毛泽东思想的理解与领会。我认为没有社会实践和生产实践的人，倒是很难真正学好毛泽东思想。我自己感觉到，越忙越想读毛泽东同志的著作。除了千方百计地利用业余时间外，我在车船上也抓紧时间读书。《实践论》就是在轮渡上陆续读完的。还有开会前后的时间，我也尽量利用起来，哪怕只能读一、二段，也要不间断地读下去。
