Two *Xintianyou* Folk Songs
    Huang Biao, Yan'an, Shaanxi

    *Xintianyou* first sings of the Communist Party,
    Children first learn to call "Mother,"
    *Xintianyou* first sings of the Communist Party.
    The green-skinned watermelon has a red heart,
    The life in the commune is sweet as sugar.
    Where does the happy life come from?
    It all depends on the Party pointing out the good direction.
    The stars in the sky revolve around the sun,
    We will always follow the Communist Party.

    Of all the relatives in the world, parents are dearest,
    The South Star is bright, the Big Dipper is bright,
    But they can't compare to a red sun.
    The Yellow River is deep, the Yangtze River is long,
    But they can't compare to the sea, they can't compare to the ocean.
    Of all the relatives in the world, parents are dearest,
    But they can't compare to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    信天游两首
    陕西延安　黄彪
    信天游先唱共产党小孩儿说话先喊娘，信天游先唱共产党。绿皮皮西瓜红瓤瓤，公社的生活甜如糖。幸福的生活哪里来？全凭党指出好方向。天上的星星绕太阳，咱永远跟着共产党。
    世上的亲人数爹娘南极星明来北斗星亮，比不过一颗红太阳。黄河水深来长江长，比不过海来比不过洋。世上的亲人数爹娘，比不过毛主席和共产党。
