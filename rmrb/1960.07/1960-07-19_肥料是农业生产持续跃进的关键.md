Fertilizer is the Key to Sustained Leaps in Agricultural Production

Recently, some provinces and regions have put forward a bold slogan: "Grasp fertilizer with the same effort as grasping water conservancy!" This is a very good slogan. It shows that the leading organs in these provinces and regions have placed the fertilizer issue, as a key to the sustained leap forward in agricultural production, on their agenda.

In recent years, with the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, fertilizer accumulation and production work in various parts of our country has made considerable progress. Due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneously promoting farm manure and chemical fertilizers, and combining regular fertilizer accumulation with shock fertilizer accumulation, the quantity of fertilizer has increased, and the quality has also improved, becoming a prerequisite for continuous agricultural production increases in our country. However, fundamentally speaking, our fertilizer supply has not yet escaped the phenomenon of "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Grain crops compete with cash crops for fertilizer, and staple grains compete with miscellaneous grains; if we want to top-dress this crop, we often have to divert the base fertilizer for the next crop. These situations tell people that the time has come to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem.

On the agricultural front, our goal for the past few years has been to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, so that grain yield per mu reaches 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively. In 1958, the national average grain yield per mu was more than 270 jin. That is to say, in the next few years, the grain yield per mu in various parts of the country must increase by more than 100 jin, 200 jin, and 500 jin respectively in order to achieve the "Program" targets. According to experiments in some areas of Guangxi, under local soil conditions, producing 100 jin of rice requires approximately 1.8 jin to 2.4 jin of nitrogen fertilizer, 0.7 jin to 1.4 jin of phosphate fertilizer, and 1.7 jin to 3.1 jin of potash fertilizer. Converting these nutrients into farm manure is equivalent to 5 dan of human and animal urine, or 5 dan of pig manure, or 8 dan of compost. The soil quality varies from place to place, and the fertilizer composition is not exactly the same, so the fertilizer requirement for 100 jin of rice will certainly not be exactly the same as in Guangxi. However, extrapolating from one place to the others, to achieve a substantial increase in grain yield within a few years, it is necessary to correspondingly increase fertilizer application. According to surveys and calculations in various parts of Jiangsu: to achieve a rice yield of 800 jin per mu, and a wheat yield of 300 jin to 500 jin per mu, averaging summer and autumn harvests, calculated by sown area, each mu must be applied with 35 dan to 50 dan of high-quality base fertilizer. The current actual fertilization level, in areas with more fertilizer, averages no more than 15 dan to 20 dan of accumulated fertilizer per mu, which is less than half of the aforementioned figures. Some areas do not apply refined fertilizer at all, and even the application of crude fertilizer is very small. It can be seen that among the various conditions for increasing agricultural production, fertilizer has become a weak link.

This weak link can be completely strengthened. The great achievements made in transforming low-yield fields in some areas in recent years are the result of strengthening this weak link. The average yield per unit area of grain in our country is not high, and one of the important reasons is that it is "dragged down" by a considerable part of low-yield fields. According to statistics from the agricultural department, there are more than 460 million mu of various low-yield fields in the country, of which more than 200 million mu have been improved to varying degrees, and more than 200 million mu still need to be vigorously improved in the future. The grain yield of these low-yield fields is generally only 100 to 200 jin, and some are only dozens of jin, becoming a "dead corner" in agricultural production. In order to achieve balanced yield increases over large areas and rapidly increase the total grain output of our country, it is necessary to accelerate the transformation of all low-yield fields and give full play to their yield-increasing potential. There are many ways to improve the soil, and increasing fertilizer application and "applying fertilizer according to soil type" are among the main ones. In the past, Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, had a large number of low-yield fields, called crusted sandy fields, yellow mud fields, cold water fields, cold slurry fields, etc., which could only grow one crop a year. After the water conservancy problem was solved, continuous planting of green manure for two years greatly improved the fertility of the low-yield fields, and the yield of rice per mu increased from the past 200 to 300 jin to more than 500 jin. The green manure planting area in the county was 160,000 mu in 1958 and expanded to 320,000 mu in 1959. The total grain output of the county in 1959 increased by 40.1% compared with 1958. This is a clear example of using green manure to improve the soil. In the efforts to transform low-yield fields in other areas, increasing fertilizer application has also had an immediate effect.

The "Eight-Character Charter" is the magic weapon for increasing agricultural production in our country. The eight measures promote and influence each other. When one measure develops, it requires other measures to cooperate and keep up in a timely manner; when one measure changes, it promotes simultaneous changes in other measures. Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and fertilizer is a prerequisite for high yield. The combination of water and fertilizer, and fertile soil, become the material basis for increasing agricultural production. In the past few years, we have already made great achievements in water conservancy construction. Now it is possible to free up our hands to carry out a vigorous and down-to-earth fertilizer accumulation and production movement while continuing water conservancy construction, so as to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem. "Whether there is a harvest or not depends on water, how much the harvest is depends on fertilizer." After the water conservancy conditions are improved, fertilizer must keep up. If there is water but no fertilizer, the land only "drinks" but does not "eat," which not only cannot greatly increase production, but may also cause the soil fertility to gradually decrease. To completely solve the fertilizer problem, we must not adopt the method of accumulating and using fertilizer as it is accumulated, and using as much as is accumulated. We must implement overall planning and establish fertilizer accumulation and production work on a solid and reliable basis, so that the fertilizer supply precedes each season and each year of agricultural production, and supplies the fertilizers needed in all seasons on time, in quantity, in quality, and in variety.

The fertilizer problem seems simple, but it is actually quite complicated. There are many types of fertilizers, and the sources of fertilizer vary from place to place; different soils require different fertilizers; crops also need different fertilizers at different stages of growth; when the cultivation system and cultivation methods change, the fertilizer supply must also change accordingly; large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production involves the use of manpower, the arrangement of funds, and the adjustment of cultivated land. These complex situations show that to solve the fertilizer problem, an overall plan is indispensable. Overall planning is to adjust and resolve contradictions, and to properly arrange various things that are interconnected and mutually restrictive within a certain period of time. For many years, we have done this whenever we solve major construction problems; to completely solve the fertilizer problem, there is naturally no exception. In this regard, Jiangsu's approach can be used as a reference. In mid-June, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of agricultural secretaries of various regions, cities, and counties to analyze the fertilizer application situation in various types of areas in the province, study the province's main fertilizer sources, summarize the fertilizer accumulation and production experience in various places, and formulate a fertilizer plan from now until 1962. According to this plan, the province will focus on refined fertilizer, focus on base fertilizer, and greatly increase the application of refined fertilizer in base fertilizer. This will enable fertilizer work to embark on a path of planned development. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, special districts, counties, communes, and production teams in the country should, like Jiangsu Province, make three- to five-year and current-year fertilizer plans at all levels (in the current-year plan, there should also be specific seasonal and itemized arrangements) according to the requirements of achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, while planning and acting, and launching a high tide of fertilizer accumulation and production.

When carrying out overall planning, we should first make an effort to truly understand the fertilizer situation, and clarify the current situation and development prospects of fertilizer supply and demand; try every means to open up fertilizer sources and find the fundamental ways to solve the fertilizer problem in the local area. For example, what is the fertilizer application level in this region and this commune? How much fertilizer is needed to achieve this year's production increase target? How well prepared are the top-dressing required for the current autumn crops and the base fertilizer required for autumn sowing and winter sowing this year? What effective measures can be taken to make up for the shortfall? In order to achieve the production increase target of the National Agricultural Development Program, how much fertilizer needs to be increased in the next few years? Many areas have not yet understood these situations; only by understanding these situations can we set realistic planning targets and measures for fertilizer accumulation and production.

Not only should we consider the quantity of fertilizer, but also the quality and variety of fertilizer. The higher the yield per unit area of crops, the more and better fertilizer is needed, and the better the combination of various fertilizers is needed. Therefore, crude fertilizer and fine fertilizer, natural fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, foreign chemical fertilizer and local chemical fertilizer, etc., should be rationally arranged. When arranging fertilizer varieties, we should not only pay attention to the yield-increasing effect of the current year, but also pay attention to cultivating and improving soil fertility, not only pay attention to reducing the cost of fertilizer, but also pay attention to saving labor for fertilizer accumulation, production, and transportation.

In order to solve the fertilizer problem, we should implement the policy of "walking on two legs" that combines shock fertilizer accumulation with the construction of fertilizer bases; from a long-term perspective, building and strengthening fertilizer bases is the fundamental guarantee for solving the fertilizer problem. Since fertilizer sources vary from place to place, which type of fertilizer base should be the main focus of construction in various places should be decided according to local conditions. However, for most parts of the country, there are three types of bases that should be established. First, the base for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. Pig manure is recognized as a good fertilizer. More pigs, more fertilizer, and more grain is a principle that everyone understands. Therefore, with the exception of some ethnic minority areas, most parts of the country should vigorously engage in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, relying on it to supply a large amount of high-quality fertilizer. Second, the green manure base. Green manure plants contain various nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium needed by crops, and also contain rich organic matter. According to analysis by scientific departments, planting one mu of leguminous green manure crops, calculated at a yield of 6,000 jin of fresh grass per mu, the nitrogen fixed from the air by rhizobia alone is 16 to 20 jin, which is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 80 to 100 jin of ammonium sulfate. This is the cheapest source of fertilizer. Planting green manure saves more labor than accumulating and producing any fertilizer, and is especially beneficial for saving fertilizer transportation capacity and transforming low-yield fields far from villages. Southern China has a traditional habit of planting green manure, and the cultivation of green manure should be placed in an important position second only to raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. Not only should we try our best to use idle fields to sow a crop of green manure, but we should also intercrop short-term green manure between crop rows, and actively use water surfaces to grow aquatic green manure crops. In northern China, some leguminous green manure crops can also be planted using idle fields or vacant land. Third, the chemical fertilizer (including foreign chemical fertilizer and local chemical fertilizer) base. Attaching equal importance to organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer is a guiding principle for us to solve the fertilizer problem. Organic fertilizer should be accumulated and produced in large quantities, and chemical fertilizer production should be accelerated. Chemical fertilizer has the fastest effect. Under the current conditions, we should try every means to strive to produce more chemical fertilizer to promote greater grain production; with more grain, we can develop animal husbandry headed by pig raising on a larger scale; with the development of animal husbandry, we will obtain more high-quality organic fertilizer. In order to accelerate the production of chemical fertilizer, in addition to continuing to build some large-scale fertilizer factories, we should pay special attention to establishing local small and medium-sized fertilizer factories. Building a small fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia only takes four to six months. The ammonia water it produces every year can meet the nitrogen fertilizer needs of 200,000 mu of land. This type of small fertilizer plant can be run by counties, or jointly run by people's communes. As for local fertilizer plants, all people's communes can universally run them. In the production of local fertilizer, various places have accumulated many good experiences. For example, some places use local methods to extract ammonia from smoke, which is a valuable creation and should be universally promoted.

After an overall plan has been formulated and fertilizer bases have been determined, the methods of fertilizer accumulation and production should also be improved. Fertilizer accumulation and production should be carried out year-round according to plan, and should not be hot and cold, tight and loose. Of course, seizing favorable seasons, such as the current summer when weeds are lush and fertilizer is easy to rot, mobilizing the masses to launch a shock fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, harvesting green and pressing green, and obtaining a lot of fertilizer in a very short period of time is also very necessary. As more and more fertilizer is needed, specialized organizations for fertilizer work should be established in the people's communes. This is conducive to supervision and inspection, improving technology, and improving labor efficiency. Of course, fertilizer accumulation and production cannot rely solely on specialized teams. During the year, it is still necessary to seize favorable opportunities to carry out several mass fertilizer accumulation and production movements. In short, the combination of year-round fertilizer accumulation and production and seasonal shock, and the combination of specialized teams in charge and everyone working together, is our good way of accumulating and producing fertilizer.

Making a positive and reliable plan from top to bottom at all levels can enable leaders and the masses to clarify the goals of fertilizer work and the basic measures to achieve the goals. Of course, to turn the plan into reality, we must go through arduous efforts. Party committees at all levels should put fertilizer work on the agenda, frequently strengthen leadership over this work, and launch a mass movement for fertilizer accumulation and production. In this movement, it is necessary to rationally arrange the labor force for fertilizer accumulation and production, vigorously carry out tool reforms in fertilizer accumulation, production, and transportation, promote advanced experience, and continuously improve labor efficiency and fertilizer quality. In the process of implementing the fertilizer plan, it is necessary to continuously conduct inspections, promptly summarize experience, and solve problems such as manpower and materials encountered. Only in this way can the fertilizer plan be gradually realized, and can it become a powerful weapon for guiding and promoting fertilizer accumulation and production work.

### 肥料是农业生产持续跃进的关键

    肥料是农业生产持续跃进的关键
    有些省区近来提出了一个豪迈的口号：“用抓水利一样的劲头抓肥料！”这是一个很好的口号。它说明这些省区的领导机关，已经把肥料问题作为农业生产持续跃进的关键问题，提到自己的议事日程上来了。
    几年来，随着农业生产的持续跃进，我国各地积肥造肥的工作，有了长足的发展。由于贯彻执行了农家肥料和化学肥料同时并举的方针，实行经常积肥和突击积肥相结合，肥料的数量增加了，质量也提高了，成为我国农业连续增产的一个前提条件。可是，从根本上说来，我国的肥料供应，还没有摆脱“寅吃卯粮”的现象。粮食作物跟经济作物争肥料，主粮跟杂粮争肥料；要给这一茬庄稼上追肥，常常要挪用下一茬庄稼的基肥。这种种情况告诉人们：现在已经到了根本解决肥料问题的时候。
    在农业战线上，我们最近几年的奋斗目标，是争取提前实现农业发展纲要，使每亩粮食产量分别达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标。而1958年，全国粮食亩产量平均为二百七十多斤。这就是说，今后几年，要使全国各地每亩粮食产量分别再增加一百多斤、二百多斤、五百多斤，才能达到“纲要”的指标。据广西某些地区试验，在当地土壤情况下，每生产一百斤稻谷，约需氮肥一点八斤到二点四斤，磷肥零点七斤到一点四斤，钾肥一点七斤到三点一斤。把这些肥分折合成农家肥料，相当于人粪尿五担，或猪粪尿五担，或沤肥八担。各地土质不同，肥料成分也不尽相同，各地百斤稻谷的需肥量当然不会跟广西完全一样。但是，从一地的情况以概其余，在几年之内，要求粮食产量大幅度地增长，就必须相应地增施肥料。据江苏各地调查计算：要达到水稻单产八百斤，三麦单产三百斤到五百斤，夏秋两熟平均，按播种面积计算，每亩要施优质基肥三十五担到五十担。而目前实际施肥水平，在肥料较多的地区，每亩平均积肥不过十五担到二十担，还不及前述数字的一半。有些地区甚至根本不施精肥，就是粗肥也施的很少。由此可见，在农业增产的各种条件当中，肥料已经成为一个薄弱的环节。
    这个薄弱环节是完全能够加强起来的，几年来好些地区在改造低产田方面取得很大成绩，就是加强了这一薄弱环节的结果。我国的粮食单位面积产量平均计算还不算高，重要原因之一，是被相当大的一部分低产田“拖”住了。据农业部门统计，全国共有各种低产田四亿六千多万亩，其中经过不同程度改良的已有两亿多亩，今后需要继续大力改良的尚有两亿几千万亩。这些低产田的粮食产量一般只有一、二百斤，少的不过几十斤，成为农业生产中的“死角”。为了实现大面积平衡增产，迅速提高我国的粮食总产量，必须加速改造全部低产田，充分发挥它们的增产潜力。改良土壤有很多办法，增施肥料和“按土施肥”是其中主要的一个。江西东乡县过去有大量低产田，名叫结板沙田、黄泥田、冷水田、冷浆田等等，一年只能种一季作物。在水利问题解决之后，连续种植两年绿肥，低产田的肥力大大提高，水稻每亩产量由过去的二、三百斤提高到五百斤以上。全县绿肥种植面积1958年为十六万亩，1959年扩大到三十二万亩，全县粮食总产量1959年比1958年增加40.1％，这是运用绿肥改良土壤的一个明显的例子。别的地区在改造低产田的努力中，增施肥料也发生了立竿见影的功效。
    “八字宪法”是我国农业增产的法宝。八种措施，互相推进，互相影响。一种措施发展了，要求别的措施及时配合，紧紧跟上；一种措施变化了，推动别的措施同时变化。水利是农业的命脉，肥料是丰产的先决条件。水、肥配合，土壤肥沃，成为农业增产的物质基础。几年以来，我们在水利建设方面已经取得了巨大的成绩。现在已经有可能腾出手来，在继续进行水利建设的同时，开展一个轰轰烈烈和踏踏实实的积肥造肥运动，以便从根本上解决肥料问题。“有收无收在于水，收多收少在于肥。”水利条件改善以后，肥料必须跟上来。如果有水无肥，土地只“喝”不“吃”，不仅不能大量增产，还可能引起土壤肥力逐渐减低。要彻底解决肥料问题，决不能采取现积现用、积多少用多少的办法，必须实行全面规划，把积肥造肥工作建立在一个坚实可靠的基础上，使得肥料供应走在每一季、每一年的农业生产之前，按时按量按质按品种地供应一年四季所需要的肥料。
    肥料问题，看起来似乎简单，实际上相当复杂。肥料种类繁多，各地肥源不同；不同的土壤需要不同的肥料；农作物在不同的生长阶段也需要不同的肥料；耕作制度和栽培方法改变了，肥料供应也得跟着变；大规模积肥造肥涉及人力的使用、资金的安排、耕地的调剂等方面。这些复杂情况说明，要解决肥料问题，没有一个全面规划是不行的。全面规划，就是调节和解决矛盾，在一定的时间以内，把互相联系、互相制约的各种事物，加以适当的安排。多少年来，我们凡是解决重大的建设问题，都是这样作的；要彻底解决肥料问题，自然不能例外。在这方面，江苏的作法可以参考。六月中旬，江苏省委召开了各地、市、县委农业书记会议，分析了全省各类地区的施肥情况，研究了省内主要肥源情况，总结了各地积肥造肥经验，制订了从现在到1962年的肥料规划。根据这个规划，全省将大抓精肥，大抓基肥，大大增加基肥中的精肥施用量。这样可以使肥料工作走上有计划发展的道路。全国一切省、区、市、专区、县、公社和生产队，都应该像江苏省这样，根据提前实现全国农业发展纲要的要求，层层做出三、五年的和当年的肥料规划（在当年的规划中，还应该有分季、分项的具体安排），边规划，边行动，掀起一个积肥造肥的高潮。
    进行全面规划的时候，首先应该下一番工夫，切实摸清肥料的底子，把肥料供求的现状和发展前途弄明白；千方百计开辟肥源，找出当地解决肥料问题的根本途径。例如，本地区、本公社的施肥水平有多高？实现当年增产指标需要多少肥料？当前大秋作物所需追肥和今年秋播冬播所需基肥准备得怎样？采取哪些有效措施才能补足缺数？为了实现农业发展纲要的增产指标，在今后几年以内，需要增加多少肥料？现在很多地区还没有摸清这些情况；只有摸清这些情况，才能定出切合实际的积肥造肥计划指标和措施。
    不只要考虑肥料的数量，还要考虑肥料的质量和品种。农作物单位产量越高，越需要更多更好的肥料，越需要各种肥料很好的搭配。因此，对于粗肥和细肥、自然肥料和化学肥料、洋化肥和土化肥等等，都要加以合理的安排。在安排肥料品种的时候，既要注意当年的增产效果，也要注意培养和提高土壤的肥力，既要注意降低肥料的成本，也要注意节省积肥造肥运肥的劳动力。
    为了解决肥料问题，应该实行突击积肥和建设肥料基地相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针；从长远的需要来看，建设和加强肥料基地，更是解决肥料问题的根本保证。由于各地肥源不同，各地以建设哪种肥料基地为主，应该因地制宜加以决定。但是，就全国大多数地区来说，有三种基地应当建立。第一，是养猪积肥的基地。猪粪是公认的好肥料。猪多、肥多、粮多，谁都懂得这个道理。因此，除了某些少数民族地区以外，全国大多数地区都应当大搞养猪积肥，依靠它来供应大量的优质肥料。第二，是绿肥基地。绿肥植物含有农作物所需要的氮、磷、钾各种养分，还含有丰富的有机质。根据科学部门分析，种一亩豆科绿肥作物，按亩产六千斤鲜草计算，光是通过根瘤菌从空气中固定的氮就有十六到二十斤，相当八十到一百斤硫酸铵的肥效。这是最便宜的肥源。种植绿肥比积造任何肥料都省工，对于节省肥料运输力、改造距村庄远的低产田特别有好处。我国南方地区素有种植绿肥的习惯，应该把培育绿肥摆在仅次于养猪积肥的重要地位上。不仅应该尽量利用休闲田播种一季绿肥作物，还应该在作物行间间作短期绿肥，并且积极利用水面，大种水生绿肥作物。在北方地区，也可以利用休闲田或空闲地，多种一些豆科绿肥作物。第三，是化学肥料（包括洋化肥和土化肥）基地。有机肥料和无机肥料并重，是我们解决肥料问题的一条指导方针。有机肥料要大量积造，化学肥料要加速生产。化学肥料见效最快，在目前的条件下，应该想尽一切方法，力争多生产一些化学肥料，促进粮食更多地增产；粮食多了，就可以更大规模地发展以养猪为首的畜牧业；畜牧业发展了，又会获得更多的优质有机肥料。为了加速生产化学肥料，除了继续建设一些大型化肥工厂以外，应该特别注意兴办地方性的中小型化肥工厂。建设一个年产八百吨合成氨的小化肥厂，只要四至六个月的时间，它每年生产的氨水，可以满足二十万亩土地对氮素肥料的需要。这类小型化肥厂，县可以办，人民公社可以联合办。至于土化肥厂，所有人民公社都可以普遍地办。在土化肥生产方面，各地已经积累了不少好经验。例如，有些地方利用土法从烟中取氨，就是一项很有价值的创造，应当普遍加以推广。
    定出了全面规划，确定了肥料基地，还应当改进积肥造肥工作的方法。积肥造肥应当按照计划常年进行，不应忽冷忽热时紧时松。当然，抓紧有利的季节，像目前这个百草丛生、肥料容易腐熟的夏季，发动群众突击积肥造肥，采青压青，利用很短的时间，取得很多的肥料，也是很必要的。由于需要的肥料越来越多，在人民公社中，应当建立肥料工作的专业组织。这样便于督促检查，改进技术，提高劳动效率。当然，积肥造肥也不能单纯依靠专业队，在一年之中，抓住有利时机，开展几次全民性积肥造肥运动，还是很必要的。总之，常年积肥造肥和季节性突击相结合，专业队负责和大家动手相结合，就是我们积肥造肥的好办法。
    从上到下，层层制出一个积极可靠的规划，能使领导和群众明确肥料工作的奋斗目标和达到目标的基本措施。当然，要把规划变成现实，还必须经过艰巨的努力。各级党委应当把肥料工作提到议程上来，经常加强对这一工作的领导，发起积肥造肥的群众运动。在这个运动中，要合理安排积肥造肥的劳动力，大搞积肥造肥运肥方面的工具改革，推广先进经验，不断提高劳动效率和肥料质量。在肥料规划的执行过程中，应当不断进行检查，及时总结经验，解决遇到的人力、物力等等问题。只有这样，肥料规划才能逐步实现，才能成为指导和推动积肥造肥工作的一个有力武器。
