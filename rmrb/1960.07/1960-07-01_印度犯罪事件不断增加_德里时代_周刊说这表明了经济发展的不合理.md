Xinhua News Agency, 30th June. The "Delhi Times" weekly, published on June 12th, revealed that crime is constantly increasing in Indian society, causing increasing public unease. The weekly pointed out that this is a result of India's economy increasingly moving towards monopoly, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the increasing poverty of towns.

    The weekly, in an article, listed three murder cases that recently occurred in broad daylight in the downtown area of the Indian capital, in the courtyard of the court, and in front of the police station. It also said: "Criminal acts are not just murder, looting, and bank robbery. If you pick up any day's (Indian) newspaper, you can see countless news about theft, kidnapping, arrests, trials, and convictions across the country."

    The weekly continued: "The increasing number of illegal cases in (India's) capital has made people uneasy. The public is uneasy, and the authorities are unable to eliminate this threat. Banks are unsafe, and the streets are unstable. Of course, houses and individuals are likely to be attacked suddenly at any time." "Therefore, murder, blatant looting, robbery, theft, kidnapping, women's lack of safety, constant worry about losing things and insecurity of life, court cases, endless interrogations, and convictions, etc. - these are all terrible scenes that appear in our society."

    The weekly said: "The number of people reporting cases is too large for the police to handle, resulting in people losing interest in reporting to the police." And "the whole process of being questioned by the police, attending court, and giving the police 'wine money' before and after the police find the stolen property, etc., is so annoying to an ordinary person that he often prefers to suffer some losses rather than report to the police." On the other hand, more and more bad people are using "bribery to the police to carry out the worst criminal activities."

    The weekly pointed out that "obviously, the root of our ills is political and economic problems." It said, "Since our country (India) became independent, we have not been able to build the economy on a solid foundation for the greatest benefit of the common people. As a result, more and more people are unemployed and the poor are getting poorer, and people are reduced from a general standard of living to starvation. At the same time, the rich are getting richer. The new factories that are being built or expanded rarely bring higher purchasing power to the people. On the contrary, these factories will make the rich richer."

    The article said: "The increasing number of criminal activities does not indicate that the people are guilty. This shows that our economic development is unreasonable and has been frustrated."

     印度犯罪事件不断增加
    “德里时代”周刊说这表明了经济发展的不合理
    新华社30日讯　据6月12日出版的“德里时代”周刊揭露，目前印度社会中犯罪事件正在不断增加，公众因而愈来愈感到不安。这家周刊指出，这是印度经济日益走向垄断、农村经济破产、城镇日益贫困的结果。
    这家周刊在一篇文章中列举了不久前在光天化日之下接连发生在印度首都闹市中心、法院院子里和警察局前面的三起谋杀案件。并且说：“犯罪行为不光是谋杀掠夺，以及抢劫银行而已。如果你拿起任何一天的（印度）报纸，你就可以看到在全国有无数关于偷窃、绑架、逮捕、审判、判罪的消息”。
    这家周刊接着说：“（印度）首都越来越多的违法案件已使人们感到不安。公众不安，而当局又没有能力消除这种威胁。银行不安全，街道也不安定。当然，房子和个人在任何时候都有可能受到突然袭击”。“因此，谋杀、公然无阻的劫掠、抢夺、偷窃、绑架、妇女没有安全、不断地担心遗失东西和生命不安全、法庭的案件、没个完的审问以及定罪等等——这些事情都是出现在我们社会里的可怕的情景。”
    这家周刊说：“报案的人数太多了，以致警察处理不了，结果使人民对向警察报案一事不感兴趣”。而“受警察询问、出席法庭以及在警察追查出被偷的财产的前后都要给警察‘酒钱’等等这整个一套程序对一个普通人来说，是这样令人讨厌，以至于他常常情愿遭到点损失而不愿去向警察报告”。而另一方面，越来越多的坏人正在用“收买警察的方式进行最坏的罪恶活动”。
    这家周刊指出，“显然，我们的弊病的根源是政治上和经济上的问题”。它说，“在我们国家（印度）独立以后，我们一直没有能力为了普通人民最大的利益使经济建立在巩固的基础上。结果造成越来越多的人失业和穷人更加贫困，人民从一般的生活水平降低到挨饿的程度。与此同时，富人却越来越富。正在开工或正在扩建的新工厂很少给人民带来较高的购买力。相反，这些工厂会使富人更加富有”。
    文章说：“越来越多的犯罪的活动并不表明人民有罪。这表明了我们的经济发展不合理和遭到挫折的情况”。
