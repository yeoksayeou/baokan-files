　　At the Tomb of Nie Er
　　——Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Comrade Nie Er's Death
　　Lin Lin
    In early March of this year, I was in Yangon when I heard that Nie Er's tomb had been built on Xishan in Kunming. I resolved to visit Nie Er's tomb when I passed through Kunming on my way back to China.

    Comrade Liu Tieshan of the National Song and Dance Troupe and others accompanied me to Xishan to visit the tomb. I was worried that I wouldn't have time to buy a bouquet of flowers, but a comrade said, "Just hold the sincere flowers in your heart, why bother with formalities?"

    As soon as the car climbed Xishan, there was a burial ground, and we got out and went up. Nie Er's tomb happened to be on the edge of that burial ground. What was striking and felt intimate was that Comrade Guo Moruo had written "Tomb of the People's Musician Nie Er" on the tombstone. I read the epitaph written by Comrade Guo Moruo. Everyone stood solemnly by the tomb for a while, and suddenly Nie Er's face seemed to appear before my eyes. I thought to myself, if Comrade Nie Er had a spirit in heaven, he could enjoy the red peaches, the beautiful camellias, and the magnificent Dianchi Lake here, and at the same time he could hear the sound of machines being built under Xishan, and the heroic songs he composed would also serve the construction of socialism. Comrade Nie Er would be smiling, wouldn't he!

    Comrade Zhang Tianxu's tomb happened to be next to Comrade Nie Er's on the left. I killed two birds with one stone and also visited Comrade Tianxu's tomb. Comrade Guo Moruo also wrote an epitaph for Comrade Tianxu, with a four-character poem at the end, which I have specially transcribed below:

        "Two heroes of the Southwest, Nie Er and Tianxu,
      Adding brilliance to Jinbi, Dian and Er are not alone.
      The rebel army has songs, the iron wheels have books,
      String and song for a hundred generations, forever showing a grand plan."

    Here, I should briefly introduce Comrade Zhang Tianxu. Comrade Tianxu and Comrade Nie Er were from the same hometown and were comrades. They also studied in Japan at the same time. Comrade Nie Er's ashes were brought back from Japan by Comrade Tianxu. Comrade Tianxu was a member of the League of Left-Wing Writers and wrote a novel "Iron Wheels" which reflected the revolutionary uprisings in the Southwest during the Kuomintang rule. After he returned to China from Japan, he suffered from high pressure from the reactionary rule and became poor and sick (suffering from tuberculosis), which destroyed his youthful life.

    Putting Comrade Tianxu's tomb next to Comrade Nie Er's tomb, as Comrade Guo Moruo said, is not "flattering the dead," but rather a display of their revolutionary comradeship. I think it is very appropriate.

    I remember in the spring of 1935, when Nie Er first arrived in Tokyo, he lived in a small "rental room" (出租的房子) of three tatami mats wide in Jinbocho. He took me to his residence for a while. I looked at his photo album, which contained a picture of the opera "Yangtze River Storm." He was dressed as the worker Lao Wang, holding a dead child, full of righteous indignation towards the imperialists. He seemed to love this photo very much.

    He told me: Coming to Japan is not easy, and he cherishes time very much. He plans to study hard, first of all Japanese, and to make Japanese friends so he can practice Japanese. He said: Coming to Japan, there are many books I can't read, and many friends I can't talk to, how bitter!

    During the summer vacation, he was willing to go to the seaside with Japanese friends. At that time, I felt that Comrade Nie Er's enthusiasm for learning was very strong!

    In a tea shop upstairs in Jinbocho, Chinese and Japanese poetry workers held a symposium. Comrade Nie Er was a welcome guest at the symposium. He reported on the development of modern Chinese music. At that time, I can say that I knew nothing about the development of music in the motherland. I found Nie Er's report very interesting and impressive. At first, I thought Comrade Nie Er was a composer, but who knew that he was also a good music theorist. He explained many issues theoretically, and also used the violin he carried with him to play at any time, and sang at any time, as an explanation of his arguments. I remember when he talked about Li Jinhui (the host of the Mingyue Song and Dance Troupe), he pointed out that Li Jinhui's works were somewhat close to the folk, but also had a tendency of "decadent music." The disadvantage was that it only catered to the petty bourgeoisie and did not approach the working masses or reflect the working masses. He also pointed out that new music should absorb the essence of Chinese folk music. By the way, he also mentioned the then very popular "Fisherman's Song" (composed by Ren Guang, lyrics by An E). Its melody was derived from the folk music "Meng Jiangnv." We never thought that the two were related. After he sang and played it, and compared them, we could clearly hear the traces.

    When summer vacation arrived, most of the Chinese students in Tokyo went to the Boso Peninsula seaside to escape the heat, but Comrade Nie Er went to Kugenuma in Kanagawa Prefecture with Japanese music friends. Who knew that this trip would be his last, and he would never return. According to legend at the time, on July 17, a whirlpool swept the genius Nie Er into the depths of the sea. The sharp edge of Comrade Nie Er's many songs was aimed at the Japanese militarists at that time, but at that time we were young and did not know how to be vigilant. Comrade Guo Moruo also said in the epitaph, "...Unfortunately, he died, which is extremely regrettable. The reason for his drowning is still unknown."

    At that time, when we heard the unfortunate news, we were undoubtedly shocked and saddened. We discussed asking Comrade Zhang Tianxu to go to Kugenuma to handle his funeral. Comrade Tianxu returned with his ashes in tears and later handed them over to Nie Er's mother in Yunnan.

    Our comrades held a rather grand memorial service for him and also published a commemorative album, which included a eulogy poem by Comrade Guo Moruo. He compared Nie Er to the British poet Shelley, both of whom drowned in the sea when they were young. Comrade Huang Xinbo also carved a woodcut cover picture, depicting Nie Er holding a seven-stringed zither. The welcome party held for Comrade Nie Er and the memorial service held for Comrade Nie Er were so short a time apart!

    Nie Er's original name was Nie Shouxin, also known as Nie Ziyi. As a musician, it is easy to understand why he liked to use the word "ear" in his name. In the words of Gorky, writers should be the heart, ears, eyes, and mouthpieces of the class. Our musicians should be the same as writers, and Comrade Nie Er knew very well how to use his ears. He finally became the "pioneer" of modern Chinese music.

    Nie Er came from a poor family. He was a soldier and a shop assistant. He also loved the folk music of his hometown. Although he had achieved many works, he still insisted on learning. During his time in Tokyo, I also heard him say that he hoped to go from Japan to other countries for further study. The obvious characteristic of Nie Er's music is that it uses bright, strong, generous, and heroic melodies to become "the bugle of the Chinese revolution and the drum of the people's liberation." His works, whether "Road Song," "Miner's Song," "Dock Workers," or "March of the Volunteers," etc., all listened to the Party's words and moved forward along the correct class line. His art is subordinate to politics. Without political enthusiasm, could he sing so movingly?

    Before liberation, I wrote a commemorative article, comparing him to Rouget de Lisle, the author of "La Marseillaise," mainly to express his combat and practical significance. But I also believe that "March of the Volunteers" will have a greater impact than "La Marseillaise." When fighting a life-and-death struggle with Japanese militarism, the song of the March of the Volunteers resounded not only throughout the Chinese mainland, but also in various places overseas, whether on the plains of Luzon Island or in the coconut groves of Malaya. No one can deny that Comrade Nie Er's songs gave people unparalleled encouragement. Comrade Nie Er is worthy of being a great singer of our times.

    Now, Nie Er has been gone for a full twenty-five years. The "March of the Volunteers," which he collaborated with Comrade Tian Han, has become the national anthem of the new China that is building socialism. Every time I hear this powerful and majestic melody, I can't help but think about the past and the present, one battle after another, one victory after another, and we can still get great inspiration.

　　在聂耳墓畔
　　——纪念聂耳同志逝世二十五周年
　　林林
    今年3月初，我在仰光，听到在昆明的西山已经建有聂耳墓的消息，我就决意要趁回国路过昆明的时候，去探望一下聂耳墓。
    和我一起上西山探墓的，还有民族歌舞团刘铁山同志等。当时我挂意着来不及买一束香花，同行的同志就说，你就抱着你的心坎里那一束虔诚的香花吧，何必计较形式呢？
    汽车刚爬上西山，在那儿有一块冢地，我们就下车上去，刚巧聂耳墓就在那块冢地的靠边的地方。引人注目而且感到亲切的，是郭沫若同志在墓碑上写的“人民音乐家聂耳之墓”。我读了郭沫若同志写的墓志铭。大家肃然在墓畔站了一会，忽然聂耳的面影好像就在我眼前浮现了。我心里想，聂耳同志如果在天有灵，可以在这里欣赏满山的红桃，丰美的山茶花和壮阔的滇池，同时可以听到西山下正在进行建设的机器的声音，而他自己所谱写的雄歌，也为建设社会主义服务。聂耳同志该会含着微笑的吧！
    张天虚同志的墓，恰巧在聂耳同志的左旁，我一举两得，也探望了天虚同志的墓。同样郭沫若同志还替天虚同志写了墓志铭，末尾附有四言一首，特钞录如下：
        “西南二士，聂耳天虚，
      金碧增辉，滇洱不孤。
      义军有曲，铁轮有书，
      弦歌百代，永示壮图。”
    在这里，我应该稍为介绍一下张天虚同志，天虚同志和聂耳同志是同乡，又是同志，同时在日本留学，聂耳同志的骨灰，是天虚同志从日本带回来的。天虚同志是左翼作家联盟的盟员，曾写了一本长篇小说《铁轮》，反映了国民党统治时期西南革命起义的事件。他从日本回国后，因受反动统治的高压，又穷又病（害着肺结核），毁伤了他的青春的生命。
    把天虚同志的墓，附在聂耳同志的墓旁，正如郭沫若同志所说的并非“媚死”，而是表现他们革命的同志爱，我认为是很适当的。
    记得1935年春，聂耳刚到东京的时候，住在神保町一间三席宽的小“贷间”（出租的房子），他引我到过他的住房玩了一阵。我看过他的照相簿，那里面有一幅歌剧《扬子江暴风雨》，他扮饰着工人老王，抱着死去的小孩子，充满对帝国主义者的义愤。他对这张照片好像是非常心爱的。
    他对我说：来到日本也不容易，他很爱惜时间，计划要好好学习，首先是日本话，要交日本朋友，可练习日本话。他说：来到日本，有许多书不能读，有许多朋友不能谈话，这多么苦啊！
    到暑假的时候，他就愿意跟日本朋友到海滨去。当时我感到聂耳同志那股学习的热劲，真是十分强烈！
    在神保町一间茶店的楼上，中日两国诗歌工作者举行了一个座谈会，聂耳同志是为这座谈会所欢迎的对象，他报告了中国近代音乐发展的情况。当时我对祖国的音乐发展情况，可以说毫无所知。对聂耳的报告，觉得非常有趣，印象也很深刻。起初以为聂耳同志是个作曲家，哪知道他同时也是一个很好的音乐理论家。他在理论上说明了许多问题，又用他带在身边的那只小提琴随时演奏，并且随时口唱，作为他的论证的说明。记得他谈到黎锦晖（明月歌舞团的主持人）的时候，他指出黎锦晖的作品，多少接近了民间，但又有“靡靡之音”的倾向，坏处在只迎合小市民，不接近劳动大众、反映劳动大众。他又指出新音乐应该吸取中国民间音乐的精华。顺便他又提到当时很风靡一时的《渔光曲》（任光作曲，安娥作词），它的旋律是从民间音乐《孟姜女》脱胎来的。我们从没有想到这两者有着关联之处，经他这一唱那一拉，对照之下，就清楚地听出痕迹来了。
    暑假到了，在东京的中国同学们大多到房州海边避暑去，而聂耳同志就同日本音乐界朋友到神奈川鹄沼去。哪知道他这一去就不复返，终成永别了。据当时传说，7月17日那一天，是一阵漩涡把一代天才的聂耳卷入大海深渊了。聂耳同志的许多歌声的锋芒，正是对着当时的日本军国主义者的，但是当时我们年青不懂得警惕。郭沫若同志在墓志铭上还说“……不幸而死，为憾无极，其何以致溺之由，至今犹未明焉。”
    那时候，我们听到他不幸的消息，不用说是万分震惊和悲痛的，就商量请张天虚同志到鹄沼去办理他的后事。天虚同志含着眼泪带着他的骨灰回来了，后来交给在云南的聂耳的母亲。
    我们那些同志给他举行了一个相当隆重的追悼会，也出版了一本纪念册，其中有郭沫若同志的一首悼诗，他把聂耳和英国诗人雪莱相比，他们都是年青时溺死在海里的。黄新波同志还刻一幅木刻封面画，刻聂耳手提着七弦琴。给聂耳同志召开的欢迎会，给聂耳同志召开的追悼会，相隔的时日是那么短促啊！
    聂耳原名聂守信，也叫作聂紫艺，作为音乐家喜欢用“耳”字做名字那是容易理解的。按高尔基的话说，作家应是阶级的心脏、耳朵、眼睛和喉舌。我们的音乐家也应和作家一样，聂耳同志是很懂得怎样使用他的耳朵。他终于成为中国现代音乐的“开路先锋”。
    聂耳是从贫苦家庭出身的，他当过大兵，当过店员，他也爱他家乡的民间音乐，虽然有了不少作品的成绩，仍然坚持学习。在东京的时日，我还听他说过希望从日本到别的国家深造。聂耳的音乐明显的特点，是用明朗刚健慷慨豪迈的旋律，成为“中国革命之号角，人民解放之鼙鼓。”他的作品，无论是《大路歌》、《矿工歌》、《码头工人》以及《义勇军进行曲》等等，都是听了党的话，沿着正确的阶级路线前进的。他的艺术服从于政治。没有政治热情，能够这般动人的歌唱吗？
    解放前，我曾写过纪念文，曾把他和《马赛曲》的作者鲁舍·德·李里相比，主要是要表现他的战斗和实践的意义。但我还认为《义勇军进行曲》会比《马赛曲》的影响更大些。当与日本军国主义作你死我活的斗争时，义勇军进行曲的歌声，不仅响遍中国大陆，而且在海外各地，无论在吕宋岛平原，在马来亚椰林里，都可以听到。谁也不能不承认聂耳同志的歌曲，会给人们无比的鼓舞力量。聂耳同志是无愧为我们的时代的伟大歌手。
    现在，聂耳离开我们整整二十五年了。他和田汉同志合作的《义勇军进行曲》，已经作为建设社会主义的新中国的代国歌了。每次听到这富有战斗力的雄壮的旋律的时候，不禁要抚今追昔，想到一个战斗接着一个战斗，一个胜利接着一个胜利，我们还是能够得到很大的激励。
