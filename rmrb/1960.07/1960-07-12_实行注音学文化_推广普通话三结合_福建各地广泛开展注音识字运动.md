　　Combining the Implementation of Zhuyin Phonetic System to Study Culture with Mandarin Promotion
　　Phonetic Literacy Campaign Widely Launched in Various Parts of Fujian

    (Our Dispatch) The Fujian Province, with its complex dialects, has made great achievements in carrying out a mass phonetic literacy campaign. Currently, over five million workers, farmers, students, and children in vast rural areas and towns are learning phonetic literacy. Various localities are using regular schools and spare-time schools as bases, adopting a method that combines Zhuyin, cultural studies, and Mandarin promotion to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, promote Mandarin, and popularize spare-time elementary education.

    Fujian Province has as many as thirty to forty dialects. Within a single county, there can be more than ten dialects and local languages. People suffer greatly from the difficulty of “not being able to communicate, making it difficult to move an inch.” Therefore, in carrying out literacy work in dialect areas, it is necessary to simultaneously promote Mandarin. Phonetic literacy can help consolidate literacy achievements and promote the accelerated popularization of Mandarin. In recent years, schools at all levels and of all types in Fujian Province have consistently used Mandarin for teaching and literacy campaigns, and have vigorously promoted speaking Mandarin in society, creating an extremely favorable learning environment. Because the combination of phonetic literacy, cultural studies, and Mandarin promotion goes all the way to the grassroots, the phonetic literacy campaign has been widely and deeply launched in the province's rural areas and towns, achieving very significant results. Now, 85.86% of young and middle-aged people in the province have shaken off illiteracy. More than 2.6 million people are participating in spare-time higher elementary school studies, and more than 400,000 are participating in spare-time middle school and above. The number of people in the province who can speak Mandarin has reached more than 6.5 million. In Ping Shan Commune, Datian County, 5,498 people learned phonetic literacy. Within six months, 4,098 young and middle-aged people were able to skillfully master phonetic literacy, recognize, read, spell, and write, consolidating literacy achievements and greatly improving literacy skills. In a test held in May, among 68 newly literate students, 51 people recognized 1,500 to 2,000 characters, accounting for 75%; 10 people recognized about 1,200 characters, accounting for 14.8%; and 7 people recognized 700 to 1,200 characters, accounting for 10.2%. The Mandarin spoken by these students who participated in the test was very good. In Shangkeng Brigade, Yunxiao County, 250 students learned phonetic literacy. After graduating from the literacy campaign last May, they entered spare-time higher elementary school, and in February of this year, they completed the higher elementary school curriculum, rapidly popularizing spare-time junior middle school education, shortening the learning time by more than half.

    In the promotion of Mandarin and the phonetic literacy campaign, Fujian Province regards regular schools and spare-time schools as two important bases. Mandarin teaching is widely carried out in schools at all levels and of all types. After students learn pinyin, they teach it to students studying in spare-time schools, which provides a large number of teachers for further developing the mass phonetic literacy campaign. After all the teenagers in Nankou Brigade, Jiangle County, and Dabu Brigade, Songzheng County, learned pinyin and could speak Mandarin, they carried out tutoring activities under the leadership of the Party and the Youth League, helping their fathers, brothers, sisters-in-law, and sisters on a contract basis, so that 90% of the young and middle-aged farmers quickly learned to speak Mandarin. Thirty percent of the brigade members who had relapsed into illiteracy were quickly freed from illiteracy through phonetic learning. Counties, communes, and brigades throughout the province also held short-term teacher training classes to vigorously train teachers for spare-time schools who can use Chinese phonetic notation and Mandarin teaching. In Jinjiang Prefecture alone, more than 30,000 civil teachers were trained in May.

    Various parts of Fujian have also paid attention to organizing social education venues to actively cooperate, and fully used propaganda tools such as cinemas, libraries, bookstores, cultural stations, and wired broadcasting to promote the phonetic literacy campaign wave after wave. After workers and peasants improved their culture and mastered phonetic tools, they could not only read popular phonetic newspapers and periodicals, but also study theory, study philosophy, and organize to read Chairman Mao's works. 5,321 young and middle-aged adults in Datian Pingshan Commune who escaped illiteracy formed 165 groups to study Mao Zedong's works. In recent months, they have generally completed the initial reading of important works such as "On Contradiction" and "Reform Our Study".

    Recently, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to closely integrate with production, continue to deepen the phonetic literacy campaign, vigorously promote phonetic literacy, and promote Mandarin, so that more than 2.2 million workers and peasants studying in spare-time higher elementary schools can intensively study new characters and improve their ability to read and write extensively, striving to complete the task of eliminating remaining illiteracy in the shortest possible time.

    实行注音学文化　推广普通话三结合
　　福建各地广泛开展注音识字运动
    本报讯　方言复杂的福建省在开展群众性的注音识字运动中，作出了很大成绩。目前，广大农村和城镇有五百多万工人农民学生和儿童在学注音识字。各地都以普通学校、业余学校为阵地，采取注音、学文化、推广普通话三结合的办法，加速了文盲扫尾、推广普通话和普及业余初等教育。
    福建省的方言多达三四十种，在一个县内有十多种方言、土话，人们饱受
  “语言不通，寸步难行”之苦，所以在方言地区进行扫盲工作中需要同时推广普通话，注音识字就可以帮助巩固扫盲成果，促进加速推广普通话。几年来，福建省各级各类学校一直坚持采用普通话教学和扫盲，并在社会上大力提倡讲普通话，造成极为有利的学习环境。由于注音识字、学文化和推广普通话三者结合一竿到底，使注音识字运动已在全省农村和城镇广泛深入地展开，获得了十分显著的效果。现在，全省已有85.86％的青壮年摆脱了文盲状态，参加业余高小学习的有二百六十多万人，参加业余中学以上的有四十多万人，全省会讲普通话的达六百五十多万人。大田县屏山公社有五千四百九十八人通过学习注音识字，在六个月内就有四千零九十八个青壮年能熟练的掌握注音识字，会认会念，会拼会写，巩固了扫盲成果，识字能力也大大提高。他们在5月举行的一次测验中，在六十八个刚脱盲的学员中，认一千五百至二千字的五十一人，占75％；认一千二百字左右的十人，占14.8％；认七百字至一千二百字的七人，占10.2％，这些参加测验的学员们的普通话，都说得很好。云霄县上坑大队有二百五十个学员学习了注音识字，去年5月扫盲毕业后升入业余高小，今年2月就念完了高小课程，迅速普及了业余初中教育，学习时间比原来缩短了一半以上。
    福建省在推广普通话和注音识字运动中，把普通学校和业余学校作为两个重要阵地。在各级各类学校广泛开展普通话教学，学生学会了拼音后，就去教给在业余学校学习的学员，这就为进一步开展群众性注音识字运动提供了大量师资。将乐县南口大队、松政县大布大队的在学青少年，全部学会拼音字母和会讲普通话后，在党、团组织领导下，开展辅导活动，分别包干帮助父兄、姑嫂学习，使90％的青壮年农民都很快学会了讲普通话。这两个大队原来30％的回生复盲社员，通过注音学习很快又摆脱了文盲状态。全省各县、社、大队还分别举办短期师资训练班，大力培养能用汉语注音和普通话教学的业余学校的教师。晋江专区，仅在5月份就培训了民师三万多人。
    福建各地还由于注意组织社会教育场所大力配合，充分运用影院、图书馆、书店、文化站和有线广播等宣传工具，促使注音识字运动一浪高过一浪。工农群众提高了文化和掌握了注音工具之后，不仅能读通俗注音报刊，还自学理论、学哲学，组织起来看毛主席著作。大田屏山公社五千三百二十一个脱盲壮年，组成一百六十五个学习毛泽东著作小组，几个月来已普遍初读完“矛盾论”、“改造我们的学习”等重要著作。
    最近，中共福建省委指示各地密切结合生产，继续深入开展学习注音识字运动，大力推广注音识字，推广普通话，使在业余高小学习的二百二十多万工农群众，能大量突击生字，提高大读大写的能力，争取在最短时间内完成扫除剩余文盲的任务。（附图片）
