Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 3rd: Two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Hanoi gathered with immense anger this afternoon at the famous Ba Dinh Square and the streets nearby to hold a massive rally and demonstration, resolutely opposing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism in Vietnam and around the world. This massive rally and demonstration shows that the movement of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique, which has been going on for days, has reached a climax.

Ba Dinh Square was packed with people today, with banners, slogans, and cartoon placards standing like a forest. The seething crowd constantly raised their arms and shouted angrily: "Down with American imperialism!" "American imperialists get out of South Vietnam!" "Oppose the fascist Law No. 10 of 1959!".

The rally began at 4:30 PM. On the rostrum were: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, President of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Ton Duc Thang, Deputy Prime Ministers Truong Chinh and Pham Hung, Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee Ton Quang Phiet, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace Le Dinh Tham, as well as representatives from various parties and people's organizations.

Ton Duc Thang said at the rally: Currently, an increasingly high tide of anti-American struggle is sweeping the world. American imperialism is being cursed and beaten everywhere and is heading towards an irreversible collapse.

Ton Duc Thang said that in South Vietnam, the American imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique have committed heinous crimes for six years. The South Vietnamese people, driven to desperation by them, are giving a powerful counterattack with unprecedented momentum. He pointed out that it is necessary to continue to thoroughly expose the aggressive and warlike face of the US-Ngo clique, to accuse them of the monstrous crimes they have committed against the Vietnamese people, and to raise the just banner of the anti-US-Ngo struggle even higher.

Ton Duc Thang said, we warmly respond to the broad anti-American struggle of the people of the world with full revolutionary enthusiasm, and we warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by the people in the regions enslaved by American imperialism, especially the people of South Korea and Japan. We welcome the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

Ton Duc Thang then listed a large number of facts exposing the US-Ngo clique's six years of sabotaging the Geneva Accords, expanding their military and preparing for war in South Vietnam, and persecuting and massacring patriotic people. When he talked about the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, he said that the South Vietnamese people have forged an irreconcilable hatred with the extremely corrupt and brutal US-Ngo clique. The South Vietnamese people are fighting them through various powerful forms to fight for the right to live, and protect their lives and property. The current struggle momentum of the South Vietnamese people has led to the disintegration of pseudo-regimes, people's self-defense forces, and secret service organizations in many places. Many local bullies who owe the people blood debts have also bowed their heads to confess their crimes to the people, or fled to the cities and strongholds. Desertions and struggles against the "sweeps" of the US-Ngo clique are rising in many pseudo-security groups, people's self-defense forces, marine corps, and the Thu Duc Military Academy. Farmers in many places have taken back the land seized by the US-Ngo clique and landlords. The so-called "agglomeration zone policy" of the US-Ngo clique is suffering setbacks. Up to now, the number of people forced by the US-Ngo clique to concentrate in "agglomeration zones" has not reached one-tenth of the original plan.

In his speech, Ton Duc Thang expressed his firm belief that the Vietnamese people's anti-US-Ngo struggle will soon achieve victory, and American imperialism must be driven out of South Vietnam. He said that the fate of traitorous dictators like Said, Batista, Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Kishi Nobusuke is waiting for Ngo Dinh Diem.

The conference unanimously adopted the resolution of the conference and a letter to the people of South Vietnam amid soaring slogans, strongly condemning the aggressive policy of American imperialism and the crimes of the US-Ngo clique in slaughtering the South Vietnamese people.

After the conference, the masses participating in the conference held a mighty demonstration.

    更高举起反对美吴斗争旗帜　坚决要把美国强盗赶出南越
    河内二十万人反美大示威
    新华社河内3日电　河内市各界人民二十万人今天下午怀着无比愤怒的心情聚集在著名的巴亭广场和广场附近的街道上举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，坚决反对美帝国主义在越南和世界各地的侵略罪行。这次规模巨大的集会游行表明，越南人民连日来开展的反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团的运动达到了高潮。
    巴亭广场上今天人山人海，横幅标语和漫画牌矗立如林。沸腾的人群不时振臂愤怒地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义从南越滚出去！”“反对1959年第十号法西斯法令！”。
    大会在四时三十分开始。在主席台上有：范文同总理，越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜，副总理长征、范雄，越南亚非人民团结委员会主席孙光阀，越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探以及各党派、各人民团体的代表。
    孙德胜在大会上讲话说：目前全世界正在掀起日益高涨的反美斗争浪潮。美帝国主义到处挨骂和挨打，并且正在走上不可挽救的崩溃的道路。
    孙德胜说，在越南南方，美帝国主义和吴庭艳卖国集团六年来犯下了滔天罪行，被它们逼得走投无路的南越人民正在以空前浩大的气势给予强有力的反击。他指出，必须继续彻底揭露美吴集团的侵略和战争嘴脸，必须控诉他们对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行，必须更高地举起反美吴斗争的正义的旗帜。
    孙德胜说，我们以充分的革命热情热烈响应世界人民广泛的反美斗争，我们热烈祝贺被美帝国主义奴役的地区的人民，特别是南朝鲜和日本人民所取得的巨大胜利。我们欢迎南越人民的英勇的斗争。
    孙德胜接着列举大量事实揭露美吴集团六年来破坏日内瓦协议、在南越扩军备战，和迫害、屠杀爱国人民的种种罪行。他在谈到南越人民的斗争时说，南越人民同极其腐败和残暴的美吴集团结下了不共戴天之仇。南越人民正通过种种有力形式同他们进行斗争，以争取生活权利、保卫自己的生命财产。南越人民目前的斗争气势使得许多地方的伪政权、民卫队、特务组织遭到瓦解。许多地方的欠下人民血债的恶霸也已经向人民低头认罪，或者逃跑到城市里和据点里去了。在许多伪保安团、民卫队、海军陆战部队以及守德军校里，开小差和反对美吴集团“扫荡”的斗争正在高涨。许多地方的农民夺回了被美吴集团和地主恶霸抢去的土地。美吴集团的所谓“稠密区政策”正在遭受失败。到目前为止，被美吴集团强迫到“稠密区”去集中的人民还没有达到原计划的十分之一。
    孙德胜在讲话中表示坚信越南人民的反美吴斗争即将取得胜利，美帝国主义一定要被赶出南越。他说，卖国独裁者赛义德、巴蒂斯塔、李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介的命运正在等待着吴庭艳。
    大会在昂扬的口号声中一致通过了大会决议和给南越人民的信，强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略政策和美吴集团残杀南越人民的罪行。
    大会结束后，参加大会的群众举行了浩浩荡荡的示威游行。
