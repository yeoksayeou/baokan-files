Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 1st: The Cuban revolutionary government today ordered the takeover of the American Esso Mobil Oil Company and the Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil Company in Cuba because these two companies defied the Cuban government's order and refused this morning to refine crude oil sent by the Cuban Petroleum Committee at their refineries in Havana.

Armed worker-militiamen are guarding the factory equipment of the two companies that have been taken over. The government has appointed receivers responsible for taking over the two companies. At the same time, the Petroleum Committee ordered the immediate transfer of more crude oil from the oil depot in Casilda, Las Villas Province, to the refineries that have been taken over.

The order instructing the two companies to refine oil for Cuba was signed yesterday by Prime Minister Castro. The order stipulated that if the two companies refused to refine the oil, the Petroleum Committee would take over the two companies and take necessary measures to ensure the production of the refineries and to unreservedly fulfill the laws of the Republic.

In order to sabotage Cuba's fuel production, these two companies openly wrote to Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, on June 6th, saying that they had decided not to refine oil for the Cuban government. For the past ten days, they have suspended the transport of crude oil to their refineries. At the time of the takeover, Shell Oil Company had only enough fuel for five days, and Esso Mobil Oil Company had only enough fuel for two days. The government's decision pointed out that this affected the country's liquid fuel reserves.

The head office of Shell Oil Company has further taken hostile measures against Cuba, and it announced yesterday that it would prohibit the supply of oil to Cuba.

The Chairman of the Petroleum Committee, Gutierrez, said that the decision to take over the two companies has the full support of Cuban workers and technicians.

The leaders of the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the thirty-three industrial workers' unions passed a resolution last night supporting the revolutionary government's takeover of foreign oil companies and condemning the U.S. government's interference and aggression against Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 30th: The Cuban people and public opinion continue to warmly support the government's legitimate action in taking over the facilities of the American Texaco Oil Company in Cuba.

According to "Free Press," residents of Santiago de Cuba, where the Texaco refinery is located, held a rally to express their support for the revolutionary government's takeover of the American company's facilities. The Cuban Workers' Confederation convened a meeting attended by the workers' unions of thirty-three industries to discuss self-defense measures against the barbaric economic aggression of U.S. imperialism.

"Revolución" wrote in an editorial today that taking over the Texaco Oil Company's facilities when it refused to refine crude oil for Cuba was an "extremely just and necessary" step. The newspaper said that no nationalist government that truly represents the interests of the people can tolerate foreign monopoly companies acting arbitrarily and disregarding the national sovereignty of the country where they are located.

"Hoy" published a headline in large characters on the front page today: "Cuba Resists the Oil Devils!" (With picture)

    制裁帝国主义破坏　保卫国家独立主权
    古巴又接管两家外国石油公司
    举国公众支持政府反击美帝经济侵略的革命措施
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　古巴革命政府今天下令接管在古巴的美国埃索美孚油公司和英荷壳牌石油公司，因为这两家公司违抗古巴政府的命令，今天上午拒绝由它们设在哈瓦那的炼油厂来提炼古巴石油委员会送去的原油。
    武装的工人民兵守卫着被接管的两家公司的厂房设备。政府已任命负责接管这两家公司的接收员。同时，石油委员会下令立即从拉斯维利亚斯省卡西拉达的油库把更多的原油调运到被接管的炼油厂。
    指令这两家公司为古巴提炼石油的命令是在昨天由卡斯特罗总理签署的。命令规定，如果这两家公司拒绝提炼石油的命令，就由石油委员会接管这两家公司，并采取必要措施，以保证炼油厂的生产和毫不回避地履行共和国的法律。
    为了破坏古巴的燃料生产，这两家公司在6月6日公然写信给古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉，说他们决定不为古巴政府提炼石油。最近十天以来，它们中止了对它们的炼油厂的原油运输。在被接管的时候，壳牌石油公司只有供五天用的燃料，埃索美孚油公司只有供两天用的燃料。政府的决定指出，这影响了国家液体燃料的储备。
    壳牌石油公司的总公司进一步对古巴采取了敌对措施，它昨天已宣布禁止供给古巴石油。
    石油委员会主席古铁雷斯说，接管这两家公司的决定得到古巴工人和技术人员的完全支持。
    古巴工人联合会和三十三个产业工人联合会的领导人昨晚通过决议，支持革命政府接管外国石油公司，并且谴责美国政府对古巴进行的干涉和侵略。
    据新华社哈瓦那30日电　古巴人民和舆论继续热烈支持政府接管美国德士古石油公司在古巴的厂房设施的正当行动。
    据“自由新闻报”报道，德士古炼油厂所在地古巴圣地亚哥的居民曾经举行大会，对革命政府接管这家美国公司的厂房设备表示支持。古巴工人联合会召开了由三十三个行业的工人联合会参加的会议，讨论采取对付美帝国主义野蛮的经济侵略的自卫措施。
      “革命报”今天在社论中写道，在德士古石油公司拒绝为古巴提炼原油时接管它的厂房设施，是“极为正当和必要”的步骤。这家报纸说，任何一个真正代表人民利益的民族主义政府无论如何也不能容忍外国垄断公司不顾所在国的国家主权而横行霸道。
    “今日报”今天在第一版刊以这样的大字标题：“古巴抗击了石油魔鬼”。（附图片）
