Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 14th: In the major economic crop planting areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, field management is being carried out quickly and well. Oil crops, sugar beets, soybeans, hemp, and other crops generally have full and strong seedlings, and are growing well.

In Tumote Banner, the main sugar beet growing area in the region, in order to manage various crops well, all communes have divided into two fronts, focusing on the management of autumn field "miscellaneous grains" on one hand, and on the other hand, focusing on weeding, thinning, watering, fertilizing, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests for economic crops centered on sugar beets. The communes have successively drawn out more than 10,000 experienced old farmers to lead more than 20,000 female commune members to form shock teams, working side by side with more than 100 specialized teams. Leading cadres at all levels also go to the front line to participate in labor and direct the battle. From mid-June to the present, nearly 500,000 mu of sugar beets, oil crops, and other crops in the banner have undergone three rounds of intensive management, and diseases and insect pests have been promptly extinguished, fertilizers have been applied, and water has been poured, and the seedlings are getting better and better.

In the Ik Zhao League, the largest flaxseed planting area, in order to change the old habit of extensive summer hoeing, all communes have universally implemented a four-to-the-field management system of indicators, measures, work points, and management personnel, weeding and setting seedlings in a timely manner, and managing to the end, so that 1.12 million mu of flaxseed is growing tall and strong, laying a good foundation for increasing oil and flax production this year.

In the rural areas of Hulunbuir League, Bayannur League, and other places, in order to win a large-scale increase in the production of soybeans, sugar beets, sesame, and other crops, weeding and topdressing are also being intensified, and measures are being continuously added. Many communes have achieved no weeds in the fields, and full, uniform, and strong seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 14th: Jiangxi's cotton growing areas are concentrating their efforts to carry out a campaign to compete for buds and peaches, striving to produce more autumn peaches to ensure a bumper cotton harvest.

The cotton planted in various parts of Jiangxi this year is generally growing well, with strong stalks, lush branches and leaves, and has fully entered the budding stage, with early plants already flowering and fruiting, because of early, careful and good management. In order to win a bumper cotton harvest, various cotton areas, based on their experience over the years, are grasping the mid-term management of cotton fields, striving to promote cotton to produce early buds and more buds in summer, and early fruiting and more autumn bolls. Therefore, after winning full and strong seedlings, the cotton growing areas immediately organized labor to fully launch a mid-term cotton field management campaign centered on winning buds, competing for peaches, and protecting peaches.

Grasping the three major measures of topdressing, pest control, and drought prevention is the central link in winning a bumper harvest of autumn peaches. In Jiujiang Prefecture, the key cotton-producing area, the method of concentrating leadership, labor, and tools is adopted to attack the autumn peach pass. Technically, reasonable topdressing is carried out by looking at the weather, the fields, the seedlings, and the fertilizers, and weeding and topdressing, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, pruning and leafing, and cultivating soil to cover grass to prevent drought are carried out in a timely manner. Jiujiang County concentrated more than 20,000 laborers to carefully weed and topdress the cotton fields, so that more than 10,000 mu of cotton fields in the county basically achieved no grass and no insects. Duchang, Pengze, Xingzi, Hukou, and other counties have adopted different management measures according to the growth of cotton seedlings: for cotton seedlings intercropped in wheat fields and growing poorly in hilly areas, they have launched a surprise topdressing and weeding campaign; for cotton seedlings that have begun to bud and flower, they have heavily applied mixed nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers to promote more budding, more flowering, and more fruiting of autumn bolls.

At present, due to the increase in temperature, some cotton fields have been infested with insects. Party organizations in various cotton areas have held forums with cotton growing experts, technical cadres, and old cotton farmers to study measures for preventing and eliminating insects. Jiujiang, Pengze, Xinyu, and other three key cotton-growing counties have also used aircraft to kill insects, with good results.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 14th: Dangshan County, Anhui Province, seizes the critical period when cotton is producing many autumn bolls and launches a cotton field management campaign that includes pruning, intertillage, topdressing, and pest control.

The cotton in Dangshan County this year is generally growing well because it was planted in a timely manner and managed early.

While completing the summer planting tasks, all communes in the county arranged a large number of laborers to intensively carry out cotton field management, and leading cadres at all levels also went deep into the fields to divide areas and take responsibility. The laborers participating in cotton field management were all organized into specialized teams for pest control, intertillage, pruning, and topdressing, and were managed by categories and areas. At present, a total of more than 150,000 people in the county are participating in cotton field management, forming 1,097 specialized teams.

In order to complete the tasks of cotton field pruning, intertillage, topdressing, and pest control in a timely manner, the county also transferred more than 1,000 people to form cotton inspection teams to inspect the cotton field management situation in various people's communes and production teams. Now, all cotton fields in the county have been treated for pests once, and 48% of the cotton fields have been topdressed after the rain. When topdressing, all localities pay attention to strengthening the topdressing of Class III cotton seedlings in distant fields and alkaline land. 76% of the cotton fields have been intertilled after the rain, and many low-lying cotton fields have also been dredged and drained.

The main ramie producing area in Zhejiang - Xiaoshan County Guali Commune's 60,000 mu of ramie is growing very well. Now the hemp seedlings are more than two feet high, more than twenty centimeters higher than in the same period last year. The cultivation and management of ramie in this commune has basically achieved the requirements of no grass, no disease, and no insects. This is the commune members carrying out embankment cultivation on the edges of ditches in the 10,000 mu ramie high-yield square to prevent fertilizer loss.

　　内蒙古经济作物田间管理又快又好
　　江西各植棉区保蕾保铃力争多结伏桃
　　安徽砀山县各级干部深入田间划片包干加紧棉花整枝追肥中耕
    新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区各主要经济作物种植地区，田间管理工作作得又快又好，油料、甜菜、大豆、麻类等作物普遍苗全苗旺，生长良好。
    全区甜菜主要种植区——土默特旗各公社，为了管好各种农作物，都划分两条战线，一手狠抓秋田“杂粮”管理，一手大抓以甜菜为中心的经济作物锄草、间苗、浇水、追肥和防治病虫害。各公社先后抽出一万多富有技术经验的老农，带领两万多女社员，组成突击队，同一百多个专业队并肩作战。各级领导干部也到第一线，参加劳动，指挥战斗。全旗近五十万亩甜菜、油料等作物，从6月中旬到现在，经过三次突击管理，及时扑灭了病虫害，追施了肥料浇了水，苗情越来越好。
    线麻籽播种面积最大的伊克昭盟，为了改变夏锄粗放的旧习惯，各公社普遍推行了指标、措施、工分、管理人员四到田的管理制度，及时锄草定苗，一管到底，使一百一十二万亩线麻籽长得又高又壮，为今年油、麻增产打好了基础。
    呼伦贝尔盟、巴彦淖尔盟等地农村，为夺取大豆、甜菜、胡麻等作物大面积增产，也加紧除草、追肥，不断增添措施，许多公社做到田间无杂草、苗全苗齐苗匀苗壮。
    新华社南昌14日电　江西各植棉地区集中力量开展争蕾争桃运动，力争多结伏桃，以保证棉花丰收。
    今年江西各地播种的棉花，由于管得早、管得细、管得好，目前普遍生长良好，株秆粗壮，枝繁叶茂，全面进入现蕾期，早的已开花结桃。为夺取棉花大丰收，各棉区根据历年的经验，抓紧棉田中期管理，力促棉花在夏季早现蕾、多现蕾，早结桃、多结伏桃。因此，今年各植棉区在争得苗全苗壮后，便立即组织劳动力，全面展开以夺蕾争桃保桃为中心的中期棉田管理运动。
    抓住追肥、灭虫、防旱三大措施，是当前夺取伏桃丰收的中心环节。棉花重点产区的九江专区，采取领导、劳力、工具三集中的办法，猛攻伏桃关，在技术上实行看天、看田、看苗、看肥料进行合理追肥，并及时进行锄草追肥，防治病虫害和整枝打叶，培土盖草防旱。九江县集中两万多名劳动力，细致地给棉田锄草追肥，使全县一万多亩棉田基本做到了无草、无虫。都昌、彭泽、星子、湖口等县根据棉苗生长情况，分别采取了不同的管理措施：对麦地套种和丘陵地区生长较差的棉苗，突击追肥锄草；对开始现蕾开花的棉苗，重施氮、磷、钾混合肥，以促进多现蕾，多开花，多结伏桃。
    目前，由于温度增高，部分棉田出现了虫害。各棉区党组织已纷纷召开植棉能手、技术干部和老棉农座谈会，专门研究防虫灭虫的措施。九江、彭泽、新余等三个植棉重点县还使用飞机灭虫，效果很好。
    据新华社合肥14日电　安徽省砀山县抓紧目前棉花多座伏桃的关键时期，掀起以整枝、中耕、追肥和灭虫为内容的棉花田间管理运动。
    砀山县今年的棉花由于种得适时，管得早，普遍生长良好。
    全县各公社在完成夏种任务的同时，就安排了大批劳力，突击进行棉田管理，各级领导干部也深入田间划片包干。参加棉田管理的劳动力，都组成了治虫、中耕、整枝和追肥等专业组，分类分片加工管理。目前全县参加棉田管理的共达十五万多人，组成一千零九十七个专业队。
    为了适时完成棉田整枝、中耕、追肥和灭虫任务，全县还抽调了一千多人，组成了棉花检查团，分别到各人民公社和生产队检查棉花田间管理情况。现在，全县的棉田，已全部治虫一次，雨后追肥的棉田占48％。各地在追肥时，都注意加强对远田、碱地等三类棉苗的追肥。棉田在雨后中耕的占76％，许多低洼的棉田，还进行了清沟排水。（附图片）
    浙江络麻主要产区——萧山县瓜瀝公社六万亩络麻，长的很好。现在麻苗已有二尺多高，比去年同期高二十多公分。这个公社络麻的培育管理，基本上达到了无草、无病、无虫的要求。这是社员们在万亩络麻丰产方里进行沟边培土，防止肥料流失。　新华社记者　陈秉祥摄
