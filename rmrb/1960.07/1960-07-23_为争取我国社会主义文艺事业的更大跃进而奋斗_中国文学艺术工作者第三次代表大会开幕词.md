Opening Address to the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles

The Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers has opened.

More than six years have passed since the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers in 1953. These six years have been extraordinary. Both the global situation and our nation's landscape have undergone earth-shaking changes.

The current international situation is highly favorable to the struggle of people of all countries for world peace and human progress. The unprecedented growth and close unity of the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is the core of the forces for peace and the east wind that inspires the progress of the entire world. The people of all countries are forming a chain reaction, constantly opposing the aggressive and war-mongering policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. The struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence are in full swing and surging forward. The heroic Cuban people have raised the flames of struggle in the backyard of U.S. imperialism, setting a brilliant example for the people of Latin America. The Algerian people, fighting bloody battles, have dealt a severe blow to French colonialism, which is supported by U.S. imperialism, and have inspired the upsurge of national democratic movements in Africa. The people of South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, under the strict rule of U.S. imperialism, have successively overthrown the puppet regimes supported by U.S. imperialism, and the storm of struggle is just beginning. All these struggles have severely struck at the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, played a huge role in defending world peace, and have been supported by the entire socialist camp and the proletariat of the world, and by the people of all countries.

The current international struggle increasingly proves the truth that the people are the decisive factor, and that the awakened people are invincible. As the anti-imperialist front continues to expand, the imperialist camp is increasingly disintegrating, and the people of all countries under imperialist rule are increasingly awakening. The days of imperialism are numbered. The day when the oppressed people of the world unite to bury imperialism is getting closer and closer.

Our domestic situation is even more infinitely wonderful. In recent years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have not only achieved great victories on the socialist revolution front, but also achieved comprehensive, sustained, and leap-forward development in socialist construction. At present, the people of the whole country, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, are vigorously developing urban people's communes and launching technical innovation and technical revolution while advancing in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The nationwide economic and technical revolution movement in both urban and rural areas is greatly promoting the rapid development of our country's productive forces. It is of extreme importance for accelerating the technical transformation of our national economy, developing our science, technology, literature, and art, and promoting the communist spirit of the broad masses of the people. The cultural backwardness caused by the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang is rapidly changing. A scientific and cultural contingent with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone has begun to form and is constantly expanding. The high tide of cultural revolution, centered on eliminating illiteracy and educational revolution, has arrived. The movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works is developing in depth. The communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of the Chinese people have been greatly improved. They are engaged in socialist construction with high revolutionary enthusiasm and firm confidence in victory, striving to realize the great communist ideal.

With the victory of the socialist revolution and the comprehensive and sustained leap forward in socialist construction, China's literary and artistic work has also developed rapidly. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, China's socialist literature and art, under the brilliant light of the three red flags, following the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, has achieved brilliant accomplishments. All departments of our literature and art have presented a new situation of a hundred flowers blooming, a thousand reds and purples, great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity. This is the victory of the cultural revolution, the victory of the Party's General Line, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which has developed Marxism-Leninism.

We should summarize the tremendous achievements and rich experiences of China's literature and art in recent years. We must first affirm the great significance of the struggle between the two roads on the literary and artistic front. Since the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, China has been in a period of great socialist transformation. With the deepening development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the struggle on the political and ideological front between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is inevitably aroused. The political and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, every drastic change in every struggle, will inevitably be sensitively reflected in the field of literature and art. Therefore, in the past six years, a series of political and ideological struggles have been carried out on the literary and artistic front. In 1954, we launched a criticism of the bourgeois idealist thought in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and a criticism of the reactionary thought of Hu Shi, the spokesman of imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie. In 1955, we thoroughly liquidated the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, we smashed the rampant attacks of the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique and other Rightist elements in literary and artistic circles, and criticized revisionist thought in literary and artistic circles. Through this series of struggles, the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in the field of literature and art has been greatly attacked and weakened, the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work has been further established and consolidated, and the implementation of the Party's literary and artistic line and policies has been guaranteed. The ideological consciousness of literary and artistic workers has been raised, the unity of literary and artistic circles has been strengthened, and China's socialist literature and art has been healthily developed. The experience of recent years proves that China's socialist literature and art has grown up in the struggle between the two roads, and has developed and grown stronger in the struggle to constantly eliminate all kinds of bourgeois thought. New things always seek development in the continuous struggle of contradictions. Therefore, we cannot underestimate the significance of struggle. We must develop a high degree of critical spirit and constantly wage unremitting struggles against erroneous and hostile thoughts.

Adhering to the combination of literary and artistic workers with the workers, peasants, and soldiers is an important factor in our achievements. Especially since 1958, under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the vast number of literary and artistic workers have gone to the mountains and the countryside, deeply into the worker-peasant masses, and participated in actual struggles and labor training. In the process of sharing the same breath and destiny with the masses, literary and artistic workers have more or less consciously transformed their world outlook and class feelings, and their mental outlook has changed. Because they are more familiar with and understand the lives and struggles of the masses, many comrades have created excellent works, full of a strong sense of the times, overflowing with strong revolutionary enthusiasm, and profoundly reflecting the great struggle of the Chinese people to transform the world. Many works have national and mass styles and are increasingly welcomed and loved by the masses.

At the same time, due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's mass line in literature and art, the literary and artistic activities of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have gained an unprecedented vigorous development. The worker-peasant-soldier masses actively participated in literary and artistic creation and criticism, which has brought about extremely profound changes in China's literature and art. A large number of outstanding literary and artistic workers with life experience and talents have emerged from the worker-peasant-soldier masses, shining brightly in literature and art. They are constantly enriching and expanding our literary and artistic ranks, constantly enriching China's literary and artistic treasury, and have played a great role in promoting China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. With the progress of the high tide of cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers and peasants will inevitably participate in literary and artistic activities more widely and more actively. The intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals. This convergence from both sides will inevitably promote the further popularization, improvement, and prosperity of China's socialist literature and art more rapidly, diversely, and comprehensively. This is also a key trend in eliminating the difference between manual and mental labor, and we should enthusiastically cheer it!

Due to the consistent implementation of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, free competition of different forms and styles in literature and art and free debate of different schools and views in academic research have been constantly encouraged. At the same time, in the struggle against bourgeois poisonous weeds, the ideological consciousness of literary and artistic circles has also been raised, the ability to identify poisonous weeds has been trained, and the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism has been consolidated, opening up a broad world for the blooming of a hundred flowers of socialist literature and art.

In the past six years, the achievements we have made in literature and art have been tremendous, but we must never have any complacency. With the deepening development of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and with the surging high tide of the national cultural revolution, the people's need for literature and art is also growing. This requires us to constantly improve the ideological and artistic level of literature and art. To do this, we must first improve the ideological and artistic level of literary and artistic workers. This is the glorious and arduous task of our literary and artistic workers, and we must undertake this task.

In order to accomplish this task, first of all, we should further consolidate and strengthen the Party's leadership, and thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in the field of literature and art. We must further study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, arm ourselves with the ideological weapon of the proletariat, and make ourselves promoters of continuous revolution. We must resolutely promote the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants. On the basis of constantly transforming our thinking and raising our consciousness, we must continue to break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and constantly carry out artistic innovation and creation. We must conduct correct criticism and evaluation of literary and artistic heritage, bravely break through old concepts and traditions, and actively create a new national style of socialist literature and art. We must make ourselves true literary and artistic fighters of the working class.

We should further implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend under the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Practice has proved that this correct policy is the most solid, broadest, and most creative road for developing socialist literature and art. It guarantees the consistency of our literature and art in the political direction, full of the vigorous proletarian fighting enthusiasm; at the same time, it enables the originality of writers and artists to be fully utilized, and encourages the diversification of artistic styles, themes, and forms. This unity of diversity, that is, the unity of the consistency of the political direction and the diversity of artistic styles, we must make it like a symphony under a mother theme, always harmoniously and powerfully played.

We should master the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism proposed by Chairman Mao, and strive to express our great heroic era. We are in an era of heroic figures, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our people have never been so spiritually uplifted, so full of fighting spirit, so full of spirit, and so full of confidence in building socialism and realizing the communist ideal. The times give us incomparably rich themes. We should study, analyze, refine, and synthesize, and create typical characters in typical environments to deeply reflect the spirit of our times. We must make our works adapt to the requirements of the times, further encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the people, and cultivate a large number of new people with communist style.

We should highly promote the fighting spirit of our revolutionary literature and art against imperialism, and use various literary and artistic weapons, together with the people of our country and the people of the world, to resolutely oppose imperialism and resolutely oppose modern revisionism. Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world today. In order to realize its ambition to dominate the world, in order to continue to extract super-profits, U.S. imperialism is stepping up the manufacture of destructive weapons, stepping up the support of West Germany and Japan, and seriously threatening world peace. It shamelessly puts on a cloak of peace, proclaims itself the captain of the world's police, and wants to defend against "communist aggression," although such an excuse is becoming less and less marketable. For us, we especially cannot forget that U.S. imperialism has occupied our Taiwan for ten years, and the crescent-shaped blockade line it has deployed in the western Pacific has also blockaded us for ten years. It controls the United Nations and prevents the restoration of our country's legitimate status. It also frequently invades our territorial waters and airspace. Such arrogant acts of aggression are obvious to the people of the world. However, modern revisionists, represented by the Tito clique of Yugoslavia, are willing to act as accomplices, and try their best to spread bourgeois pacifism and bourgeois humanitarianism, in an attempt to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries against imperialism, undermine the people's fighting spirit, and even reverse black and white, falsely accuse us Chinese people of being "bellicose." This is what we cannot tolerate. We must constantly expose the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionists in front of the people of the world, and make the greatest efforts to stop aggression and maintain world peace. Consolidating and developing the fraternal friendship of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the primary task of strengthening the forces of peace. We must continue to enthusiastically support the just struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against colonialism and for national independence. The struggle against colonialism and the cause of defending peace are inseparable. Colonialism means war. As long as colonialism exists, peace cannot be guaranteed. We must use literary and artistic weapons to promote the demise of imperialism and colonialism. All people who love peace and justice in the world are our friends. We are "those who have justice have more help."

Comrades, the era we are in is a great era, and the task we are undertaking is a glorious and arduous task. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the great cause undertaken by the great people as an inexhaustible source, as long as we combine the spirit of bold creation with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, guard against arrogance and rashness, and persist in struggle, a literary and artistic peak greater than any era will surely appear in our great motherland. Let us hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, follow the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, strengthen unity, strengthen learning, compete with each other, help each other, set ambitious goals, establish great aspirations, and strive for a greater leap forward in China's socialist literature and art!

    为争取我国社会主义文艺事业的更大跃进而奋斗
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会开幕词
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席　郭沫若
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会开幕了。
    自1953年中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会召开以来，已经六年多了。这六年多的时间是不平凡的时间，整个世界形势和我们国家的面貌，都发生了翻天复地的变化。
    当前的国际形势，十分有利于各国人民争取世界和平和人类进步事业的斗争。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的空前壮大和紧密团结，这是和平力量的核心，是鼓舞整个世界进步的东风。世界各国人民正形成着连锁反应，不断地反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争，正如火如荼，风起云涌。英勇的古巴人民，在美帝国主义的后院首先举起了烽火，为拉丁美洲人民树立了光辉的榜样。浴血奋战的阿尔及利亚人民，使受着美帝国主义支持的法国殖民主义者受到严重的打击，鼓舞着非洲人民民族民主运动的高涨。在美帝国主义严密统治下的南朝鲜、土耳其和日本人民，接二连三地把美帝国主义所扶持的傀儡政权轰垮了，斗争的风暴正方兴未艾。所有这些斗争，都狠狠地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策，对保卫世界和平起了巨大的作用，受到了整个社会主义阵营和全世界无产阶级的支持，受到了全世界各国人民的支持。
    当前国际斗争的形势，越来越证明了这一条真理：人民是决定的因素，觉醒了的人民是不可战胜的。随着反对帝国主义战线的不断扩大，帝国主义阵营内部日益分崩离析，帝国主义统治下的各国人民也日益觉醒，帝国主义的寿命是不会太长了。全世界被压迫人民团结起来、埋葬帝国主义的日子越来越近了。
    我国国内形势，更是无限地美好。几年来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，不仅在社会主义革命战线上取得了伟大胜利，社会主义建设也获得了全面的持续的飞跃发展。目前，全国人民高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在工农业生产大跃进的同时，正在大办城市人民公社，大闹技术革新和技术革命。席卷全国的城乡经济技术革命运动，正大大促进我国生产力的迅速发展，对加速我国国民经济的技术改造，发展我国的科学技术和文学艺术，发扬广大人民群众的共产主义风格，都有极其重大的意义。帝国主义和国民党的反动统治所长期造成的文化落后状况，正在迅速改变。一支以无产阶级的知识分子为骨干的科学文化队伍已经开始形成并在不断地扩大。以扫除文盲、教育革命为中心的文化革命高潮已经到来。学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的运动，正在深入开展。我国人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质大大提高，他们以高度的革命热情和坚定的胜利信心，从事着社会主义建设，为实现伟大的共产主义理想而努力。
    随着社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的全面的持续的跃进，我国的文学艺术工作也得到了迅速发展。几年以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，我国的社会主义文学艺术，在三面红旗的光辉照耀下，遵循着为工农兵服务的方向，贯彻着百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，取得了辉煌的成就。我们的文学艺术各个部门都呈现出了百花盛开、千红万紫，大普及、大提高、大繁荣的新局面。这是文化革命的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，是发展了马克思列宁主义的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们应该总结我国文学艺术几年来的巨大成绩和丰富经验。我们必须首先肯定文艺战线上两条道路斗争的重大意义。中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会召开以来，我国正处在一个伟大的社会主义变革时期。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的深入发展，不可避免地引起了无产阶级与资产阶级之间的政治思想战线上的斗争。无产阶级和资产阶级的政治思想斗争，社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争，每一个斗争中的每一个急剧的变化，必将敏锐地在文学艺术领域内反映出来。因此，六年多来，在文艺战线上进行了一系列的政治斗争和思想斗争。1954年，我们展开了对《红楼梦》研究中资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判，对帝国主义和买办资产阶级代言人胡适的反动思想的批判。1955年，我们彻底清算了胡风反革命集团。在1957年反右派斗争中，我们粉碎了丁玲、陈企霞反党集团以及文艺界其它右派分子的猖狂进攻，批判了文艺界的修正主义思想。经过这一系列的斗争，大大打击和削弱了文学艺术领域内的资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，进一步树立和巩固了党对文艺工作的领导权，保证了党的文艺路线和文艺方针的贯彻执行。文艺工作者的思想觉悟提高了，文艺界的团结加强了，我国社会主义文学艺术得到了健康的发展。几年来的经验证明：我国的社会主义文学艺术是在两条道路的斗争中成长起来的，是在不断地肃清形形色色的资产阶级思想的斗争中发展和壮大起来的。新的事物总是在不断的矛盾斗争中求得发展。因此，我们不能低估斗争的意义，我们必须养成高度的批判精神，不断地和谬误的敌对思想作坚持不懈的斗争。
    坚持文艺工作者同工农兵群众相结合，是我们获得成就的重要因素。特别是自1958年以来，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，广大文艺工作者上山下乡，深入工农群众，参加了实际斗争和劳动锻炼。文艺工作者在和群众同呼吸、共命运的过程中，或深或浅地自觉地改造了世界观和阶级情感，使精神面貌有了改变。由于比较熟悉和理解了群众的生活和斗争，有不少同志创造出了优秀的作品，充满着浓厚的时代气息，洋溢着强烈的革命热情，深刻地反映了我国人民改造世界的伟大的斗争事迹。有不少作品具有了民族风格和群众风格，越来越为群众所欢迎、所喜闻乐见了。
    与此同时，由于在文艺上认真地贯彻了党的群众路线，广大工农兵群众的文艺活动获得了史无前例的蓬勃的发展。工农兵群众积极参加了文学艺术的创作和批评，使我国的文学艺术发生了极其深刻的变化。大批有生活、有才能的优秀文艺工作者从工农兵群众中涌现出来，在文学艺术上放出了灿烂的光彩。他们不断地充实和壮大着我们的文艺队伍，不断地丰富着我国的文学艺术宝库；对我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设起了极大的促进作用。随着文化革命高潮的进展，广大的工农群众必然会更加广泛地更加积极地参加文学艺术的活动。工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化。这样从两方面接起轨来，必然会更迅速、更多样、更全面地促进我国社会主义文学艺术事业进一步的普及、提高和繁荣。这也是消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的一个关键性的动向，我们应该热情地欢呼！
    由于坚持贯彻了党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，文学艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，学术研究上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，得到了不断的鼓舞。同时，在同资产阶级毒草进行斗争中，也提高了文艺界的思想觉悟，锻炼了识别毒草的能力，巩固了马克思列宁主义的思想阵地，为社会主义文学艺术的百花齐放开辟了广阔的天地。
    六年多来，我们在文艺上所取得的成就是巨大的，但是，我们绝对不能有任何自满的情绪。随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的深入发展，随着全国文化革命高潮的汹涌澎湃，人民群众对于文学艺术的需要也日益增长。这就要求我们不断提高文艺的思想水平和艺术水平。而要做到这样，首先就必须提高文艺工作者的思想水平和艺术水平。这是我们文艺工作者的光荣而艰巨的任务，我们必须担负起这个任务。
    为了完成这个任务，首先我们应该进一步巩固和加强党的领导，彻底肃清在文学艺术领域内的资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响。我们要进一步学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，以无产阶级的思想武器来武装自己，使自己成为不断革命的促进派。我们要坚决促进知识分子劳动化和工农群众知识化，在不断改造思想和提高觉悟的基础上，继续破除迷信，解放思想，不断地进行艺术革新和创造。我们要对文艺遗产进行正确的批判和评价，勇敢地突破旧观念、旧传统，积极地创造社会主义文学艺术的民族新风格。我们必须使自己成为真正的工人阶级的文艺战士。
    我们应该进一步贯彻在工农兵方向下的百花齐放、百家争鸣。实践证明，这一正确的方针是发展社会主义文艺的最坚实、最宽广、最富于创造性的道路。它保证了我国文学艺术在政治方向上的一致性，充满着朝气蓬勃的无产阶级的战斗热情；同时，又使作家和艺术家的独创性得以充分发挥，鼓舞了艺术风格、题材和形式的多样化。这一多样的统一，也就是政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性的统一，我们要使它如像在一个母题下的交响乐一样，永远和谐地雄浑地演奏下去。
    我们应该掌握毛主席所提出的革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，努力表现我们伟大的英雄时代。我们正处在一个英雄辈出的时代，在党和毛主席的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国人民从来没有像今天这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，充满着建设社会主义和实现共产主义理想的信心。时代给予我们以无比丰富的题材，我们应该进行研究、分析、提炼、综合，创造出典型环境中的典型人物，以深刻体现我们的时代精神。务使我们的作品能与时代的要求相适应，更进一步鼓舞人民群众的革命热情和劳动热情，大量地培养出具有共产主义风格的新人。
    我们应该高度发扬我国革命文艺反对帝国主义的战斗精神，运用各种文艺武器，同我国人民以及全世界人民一起，坚决反对帝国主义、坚决反对现代修正主义。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是当前全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义为了实现它独霸全世界的野心，为了继续吸取超额的血腥利润，它正在加紧制造毁灭性的武器，加紧扶持西德和日本，严重地威胁着世界和平。而它还不知羞耻地披着一件和平的外衣，自封为世界宪兵队长，要防御什么“共产主义的侵略”，尽管这样的借口已经是越来越没有市场了。对我们来说，我们是尤其不能忘记的，美帝国主义霸占着我们的台湾已经十年了，它在西部太平洋所布置的弦月形的封锁线也封锁我们十年了，它把持着联合国、阻止恢复我国的合法地位，它还经常侵犯我们的领海、领空，这样蛮横的侵略行为是世界人民有目共睹的。然而，以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，却甘心为虎作伥，竭力散布资产阶级的和平主义和资产阶级的人道主义，企图麻痹各国人民对帝国主义的警惕，瓦解人民的斗志，甚而倒白为黑，栽诬我们中国人民“好战”。这是我们所不能容忍的。我们必须在全世界人民面前，经常揭露美帝国主义和现代修正主义者的阴谋，为制止侵略、维护世界和平作出最大努力。巩固和发展以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的兄弟友谊，是加强和平力量的首要任务。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争，我们必须继续热烈地加以支持。反对殖民主义的斗争和保卫和平事业是不可分割的。殖民主义就意味着战争，殖民主义存在一天，和平就无法得到保障。我们必须用文艺武器来促进帝国主义和殖民主义的灭亡。全世界爱好和平和正义的人都是我们的友人，我们是“得道多助”的。
    同志们，我们所处的时代是伟大的时代，我们所担负的任务是光荣而艰巨的任务。我们深信，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，有伟大人民所从事的伟大事业作为取之不尽的源泉，只要我们把大胆创造和实事求是的精神相结合，戒骄戒躁，坚持奋斗，比任何时代更为伟大的文艺高峰，一定会在我们伟大的祖国出现。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，沿着为工农兵服务的方向，加强团结，加强学习，相互竞赛，相互帮助，树雄心，立大志，为争取我国社会主义文学艺术事业的更大跃进而奋斗！
