Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 21st: Seoul dispatch: The struggle against Syngman Rhee's remaining cronies "running" for pseudo-"National Assembly members," launched by people in various parts of South Korea, including Seoul, Masan, Iksan, and Cheonan, is developing.

    According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, over a hundred residents of Mapo District, Seoul, held a rally in front of the Seoul "City Hall" on the morning of the 21st, denouncing the traitorous acts of Syngman Rhee's cronies who wanted to participate in the "election." Then, they went to the "Seodaemun Prison" to demand that Syngman Rhee's remaining cronies, who were imprisoned for rigging the pseudo-"presidential election" but still wanted to participate in the "election," should reflect on their actions.

    According to a broadcast by Daejeon Radio Station, on the 20th, over a thousand students in Iksan, South Chungcheong Province, held a demonstration condemning Syngman Rhee's cronies for participating in the "election."

    In addition, in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, more than a thousand students held a demonstration on the 19th to oppose Han Hee-seok, a confidant of Syngman Rhee, from becoming a "candidate" for "National Assembly member." The news said that students from Cheonan High School began demonstrating on the streets at 9 a.m. that day. The slogans on their placards read: "Han Hee-seok get out!" "Don't deceive and insult the people!" Later, citizens also joined the demonstration, which continued until 5:30 p.m.

    The people of Masan, the heroic city that first raised the banner of uprising in the struggle to overthrow Syngman Rhee, have recently launched a sustained and tenacious struggle to oppose Syngman Rhee's cronies running in the "election" there. According to Tonghwa News Agency, since the 12th, they have been holding continuous sit-in demonstrations in front of Lee Yong-beom's residence to oppose Lee Yong-beom, a Syngman Rhee crony, from acting as a "candidate" for "National Assembly member." On the 19th, the people of Masan held another rally, passing a resolution to launch "larger demonstrations and struggles."

    According to Tonghwa News Agency, citizens and students of Samcheonpo, South Gyeongsang Province, waged fierce struggles from the 19th to the 20th to oppose Lee Jae-hyun, a Syngman Rhee element, from "running" for pseudo-"National Assembly member" in the area. More than 450 students and citizens demonstrated on the streets, shouting: "Get out, you who colluded with Syngman Rhee's dictatorial regime!" On the evening of the 19th, the students also smashed Lee Jae-hyun's residence. On the 20th, they continued to hold a sit-in demonstration in front of Lee Jae-hyun's "election office."

    On the 19th, more than 500 women held a protest rally and demonstration in Seoul. The resolution passed at the rally said: "We will not elect counter-revolutionary candidates!" After the rally, they held protest demonstrations in front of the Seoul pseudo-"City Hall" and the pseudo-"National Assembly."

    On the same day, in Masan, in the south, about a thousand people held a demonstration demanding that former Syngman Rhee Liberal Party "Assemblyman" Lee Yun-byeong withdraw from the "National Assembly member" election campaign. The people of this city have been demonstrating for many days. About fifty students have been on a hunger strike in front of Lee Yun-byeong's house for three consecutive days. In addition, 264 graduates of Incheon Normal School held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Seoul pseudo-"Ministry of Education" on the 19th, demanding jobs. The students submitted a protest letter to the "Ministry of Education," protesting the authorities' irresponsible attitude towards student employment issues.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: Seoul dispatch: Students of the Jinhae pseudo-Naval Academy in South Korea have launched a struggle against oppression and abuse by officers.

    According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, students at the school, in order to oppose the oppression of officers such as the "student captain," decided to protest to the pseudo-"Ministry of National Defense" authorities and sent 104 representatives to Seoul on the 14th. These officers, as Syngman Rhee's lackeys in the past, had taken all kinds of barbaric actions against the students.

    The pseudo-"Ministry of National Defense," upon hearing this news, hastily dispatched military police to intercept them en route. On the morning of the 14th, when these student representatives arrived at Daegu Station, they were forcibly dragged off the train by the military police. The students then staged a sit-in demonstration at Daegu Station. They stated that they would not give up until they met with the pseudo-"Minister of National Defense" and the "Chief of Naval Operations" in Seoul to conduct the struggle in person.

    南朝鲜各地人民展开示威斗争
    镇海伪海军士官学校学生静坐示威反对压迫
    据新华社平壤21日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜汉城、马山、李山、天安等各地人民展开的反对李承晚残余党徒“竞选”伪“国会议员”的斗争正在发展。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，汉城市麻浦区的一百多名居民21日上午在汉城“市政府”前面的广场上举行声讨大会，谴责要参加“选举”的李承晚党羽的卖国行为。接着，他们到“西大门刑务所”，要那些因为在伪“总统选举”中舞弊而被关在监狱里还想参加“选举”的李承晚残余党徒进行反省。
    据大田广播电台广播，20日忠清南道的李山有一千多名学生举行示威，谴责李承晚的党羽参加“选举”。
    另外，在忠清南道的天安，又有一千多名学生19日举行示威，反对李承晚的亲信韩熙锡充当“国会议员”的“候选人”。消息说，在这一天上午九时，有天安高等学校的学生开始在街上举行示威。他们拿的标语牌上写着：“韩熙锡滚开！”“不要欺骗和侮辱人民！”等口号。后来，市民们也参加了示威队伍，示威一直继续到下午五时半。
    在打倒李承晚的斗争中首先举起义旗的英雄的马山市人民最近为反对李承晚的党羽在那里参加“竞选”，展开了持续的顽强的斗争。据同和通讯社报道，他们从12日以来就为反对李承晚党羽李容范充当“国会议员”“候选人”而在李容范的住宅前面连续举行静坐斗争。19日，马山人民又举行声讨大会，通过决议表示要展开“更大的示威斗争”。
    据同和通讯社报道，庆尚南道三千浦的市民和学生为反对李承晚分子李在显在当地“竞选”伪“国会议员”，从19日到20日连续进行了激烈的斗争。四百五十多名学生和市民在街上举行示威，高呼：“勾结李承晚独裁政权的家伙滚开！”。学生们在19日晚间还捣毁了李在显的住宅。20日，他们继续在李在显的“选举事务所”前举行了静坐示威。
    19日，五百多名妇女在汉城举行了抗议大会和示威游行。大会通过的决议说：“我们不会选举反革命的候选人！”会后，她们到汉城伪“市政府”和伪“国会”前面举行了抗议示威。
    同一天，在南部的马山市，大约有一千人举行了示威，要求前李承晚自由党“议员”李允丙退出“国会议员”的竞选活动。这个城市的人民许多天来一直在举行示威。大约有五十名学生一连三天在李允丙的家门前进行绝食斗争。另外，仁川师范学校的二百六十四名毕业生19日在汉城伪“文教部”前面举行静坐示威，要求给他们以工作。学生们向“文教部”提交了一个抗议书，抗议当局对学生就业问题采取不负责任的态度。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜镇海的伪海军士官学校学生为反对长官对他们的压迫虐待展开了斗争。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社消息，这个学校的学生为了反对“学生队长”等军官的压迫，决议向伪“国防部”当局提出抗议，并且在14日派出一百零四名代表前往汉城。这些军官过去作为李承晚的走狗，曾采取种种野蛮行动对待学生们。
    伪“国防部”在听到这一消息后慌忙派出宪兵在途中阻拦。14日上午，当这些学生代表到达大丘车站的时候，就被宪兵们从火车上强迫拉下来。学生们于是在大丘车站进行静坐示威斗争。他们表示，不到汉城会见伪“国防部长”和“海军参谋总长”当面进行斗争，绝不罢休。
