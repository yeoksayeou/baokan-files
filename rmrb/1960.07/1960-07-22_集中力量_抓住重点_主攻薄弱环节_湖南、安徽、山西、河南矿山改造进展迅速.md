Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 20th: Hunan Province is taking various measures to accelerate the technical transformation of mines, promoting a substantial increase in the output of ore and coal. Currently, the province's daily iron ore production has increased to more than 15,000 tons, and the daily coal production level is also rising sharply.

In order to better promote high-quality and high-yield mine production, Party committees at all levels in Hunan have recently organized a large number of cadres to go up the mountains and down the mines, camping in the mines and earnestly focusing on the technical transformation of the mines. The Hengyang Special District industrial front recently transferred 9,000 cadres to the front lines of production, of which 60% went to the mines to participate in and lead production. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also recently established front-line command posts in Shaoyang and Chenxian, two special districts with more coal and iron mines, to specifically lead mine production and transformation.

Another measure taken by Hunan to accelerate mine transformation is to concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles, driving the all-round development of mine technical transformation. The Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to first strengthen the technical transformation of key mines, concentrated more than 16,000 pieces of mining equipment to arm the four key iron and coal mines such as Dayishan and Bajingtian. The provincial metallurgical system has also ranked the existing iron mines and decided to concentrate forces to complete the transformation in batches; the first batch of twenty-five key iron mines have already received the necessary equipment for transformation, and nine of them have basically completed the transformation of ground transportation. All walks of life in Hunan have also taken effective measures to support the technical transformation of mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 20th: Anhui Province is vigorously transforming large, medium, and small iron mines, which has rapidly increased ore production, powerfully guaranteeing the growing needs of steel production. The province produced 500,000 tons more ore than planned in the first half of the year, and the actual output increased by 74.5% compared with the first half of last year.

Adding mine crushing equipment and improving loading, unloading, and transportation methods are the central links in the technical transformation of large mines in Anhui Province this year. Of the batch of crushing equipment planned to be added to the three large mines of Nanshan, Gushan, and Taochong under the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company this year, seven have already been put into production, and the remaining equipment will also be put into production before the end of the year. After all these crushing equipment are put into production, the crushing capacity of the three large mines will double, which can fully meet the needs of steel production growth. The company is also building a batch of ore storage bins in the mines. After the new ore storage bins are put into production, it can ensure that mine production is not affected for five days without transportation, and ore can be transported out even if there is no production for five days. The mines are also carrying out endless rope transportation on the working face, and automatic hook-up vehicles for ore downhill, which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient trucks, but also greatly improved the internal transportation capacity of the mines.

While carrying out the technical transformation of large mines, Anhui Province is also focusing on the technical transformation of medium and small mines. It has now been determined that eighteen medium and small mines will be the focus of transformation this year. After the transformation of these eighteen medium and small mines, the annual production capacity will double compared with the present.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 20th: Shanxi Province is vigorously grasping the technical transformation of mines, greatly increasing the production of ore, and ensuring the sustained leap forward in blast furnace production. The iron ore produced in the province in the first half of the year increased by more than 27% compared with the same period last year, exceeding the national plan for the first half of the year by 35%. Due to the increase in ore production, small iron smelters throughout the province currently have reserves of raw materials for half a month to a month.

In the mass mine technical transformation movement, the Liangjiagaduo Mine in Jiexiu County took the lead. They adopted a self-reliant approach and spent fifteen days building a 1,500-meter-long mountain railway, changing manual drilling to mechanical drilling, and realizing transportation with wooden rails above ground and underground, and cableways in the air, which increased ore production from 200 tons per day to 450 tons, and also greatly reduced costs. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly seized this model, held an on-site meeting, and quickly launched a mine technical transformation movement throughout the province to learn from and catch up with the Liangjiagaduo Coal Mine, and "transform one mine into three mines". At present, eighteen small mines in the province have undergone comprehensive technical transformation. These mines have basically achieved mechanization of mining, electrification of lighting, vehicle transportation in the pit, and cableway transportation at high altitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 20th: Under the guidance of the idea of "taking steel as the key link and ensuring steel with coal", the employees of small coal mines in Henan Province concentrated their superior forces, focused on key production areas, vigorously grasped the technical transformation of mine shafts, and promoted a substantial increase in raw coal production. The average daily production level of small coal mines in the first half of this year increased by 81.5% compared with the same period last year.

In order to improve the production capacity of small coal mines, Henan has universally strengthened the technical transformation of small coal kilns since the beginning of this year. In accordance with the principle of first ensuring the high-speed growth of coking coal, various places have concentrated manpower and material resources to accelerate the transformation of coking coal mines, and have focused on liberating heavy manual labor, attacking the lifting, drainage, ventilation, and transportation links. Therefore, in just a few months, the production and technical aspects of the mines have undergone great changes. At present, the small coal mines above the county level in the province have basically realized mechanized and semi-mechanized production in the main production links such as lifting, drainage, ventilation, and transportation, which has greatly reduced the labor intensity of workers, and significantly improved labor efficiency and production capacity. Calculated only on the basis of the ninety-one pairs of mine shafts after the transformation, the annual production capacity has nearly doubled compared with the past.

    集中力量  抓住重点  主攻薄弱环节
    湖南、安徽、山西、河南矿山改造进展迅速
    湖南：大批干部上山下井狠抓技术改造
    据新华社长沙20日电　湖南省采取多种措施加速矿山技术改造，促进矿石和煤炭产量大幅度增长。现在，全省的铁矿石日产量已经提高到一万五千多吨，煤炭日产水平也在直线上升。
    为了更好地促进矿山生产做到优质高产，湖南各级党委最近又组织大批干部上山下井，到矿井安营扎寨，扎扎实实狠抓矿山技术改造。衡阳专区工业战线最近抽调九千名干部深入生产第一线，其中60％的干部深入到矿山，参加生产，领导生产。中共湖南省委最近还在邵阳和郴县两个煤矿和铁矿较多的专区，建立了前线指挥所，具体领导矿山的生产和改造工作。
    湖南加速矿山改造的另一措施是，集中优势兵力打歼灭战，带动矿山技术改造全面开花。中共衡阳地委为了首先加强重点矿山的技术改造，集中了一万六千多件矿山设备武装了大义山、八井田等四个重点铁矿和煤矿。省冶金系统也把现有的铁矿进行了排队，决定集中兵力分批完成改造；第一批重点改造的二十五个铁矿已经有十四个得到了改造所需要的必要设备，其中有九个矿已基本完成了地面运输的改造。湖南各行各业也采取有效措施支援矿山技术改造。
    安徽：增添破碎设备改进装卸运输方法
    据新华社合肥20日电　安徽省大力改造大、中、小型铁矿，使矿石产量迅速提高，有力地保证了钢铁生产日益增长的需要。全省上半年比计划多生产了五十万吨矿石，实际产量比去年上半年增长74.5％。
    增添矿山破碎设备，改进装卸和运输方法，是安徽省大型矿山今年技术改造的中心环节。马鞍山钢铁公司所属南山、姑山、桃冲三个大型矿山今年计划增加的一批破碎设备，目前已有七台投入生产，其余设备也将在年底前投入生产。这些破碎设备全部投入生产后，三个大型矿山的破碎能力将增加一倍，完全可以满足钢铁生产增长的需要。这个公司还正在矿山新建一批储矿槽，新建储矿槽投入生产以后，可以做到五天不运输也不影响矿山生产，五天不生产也能有矿石运出。各矿山还在工作面上大搞无极绳运输，矿石下山搞自动挂线车，不仅解决了汽车不足的困难，而且大大提高了矿山内部的运输能力。
    安徽省在进行大型矿山技术改造的同时，还大抓中、小型矿山的技术改造。现已确定今年要重点改造十八个中、小型矿山。这十八个中、小型矿山改造以后，年产能力将比现在提高一倍。
    山西：全省小铁厂“存粮”半个月以上
    据新华社太原20日电　山西省狠抓矿山技术改造，大大增产矿石，保证高炉生产持续跃进。上半年全省生产的铁矿石比去年同期增长了27％以上，超额35％完成了上半年国家计划。由于矿石产量的增加，全省小型炼铁厂目前都储备了半个月到一个月的原料。
    在群众性的矿山技术改造运动中，介休县梁家疙瘩矿一马当先。他们采取自力更生的办法，用十五天时间修成了一条一千五百米长的盘山铁路，手工打炮眼改成了机械打炮眼，并实现了地上地下用木轨、空中用索道运输，使矿石产量由日产二百吨猛增到四百五十吨，成本也大大降低。中共山西省委及时抓住这个典型，召开了现场会议，很快在全省范围内掀起了学赶梁家疙瘩煤矿，“一矿变三矿”的矿山技术改造运动。目前全省已有十八个小型矿山经过了全面的技术改造。这些矿基本上达到了开采机械化，照明电气化，坑内运输车子化和高空运输索道化。
    河南：集中力量加速焦煤矿井技术改造
    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省小型煤矿职工在“以钢为纲、以煤保钢”的思想指导下，集中优势兵力，围绕生产关键，大抓矿井技术改造，促进了原煤产量大幅度增长。今年上半年小型煤矿的平均日产水平比去年同期提高了81.5％。
    为了提高小型煤矿的生产能力，今年以来河南各地普遍加强了小煤窑的技术改造。各地按照首先保证焦煤高速度增长的原则，集中人力、物力加速焦煤矿井的改造，并以解放笨重体力劳动为主攻目标，猛攻提升、排水、通风和运输关。因此在短短的几个月内，就使矿井的生产、技术面貌发生了很大变化。现在全省县营以上的小型煤矿，在提升、排水、通风、运输等主要生产环节上，已经基本实现了机械化、半机械化生产，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，劳动效率和生产能力显著提高。仅就改造后的九十一对矿井计算，年生产能力即比过去提高了近两倍。
