    Chairman Mao Met With Us
    By Zhang Songnan, Delegate from Zhejiang Province to the Literary and Art Congress
Green, glistening grapes
  Have yielded abundant fruit, pairs of swallows
  Return from beyond the sky. Here—in Zhongnanhai, Chairman Mao met with us
  Affectionately. More than two thousand hearts, how can they not be like trembling strings! In this instant, how many good artistic conceptions does the poet have; in this instant, how many beautiful images does the painter have; in this instant, how many good movements does the musician have; in this instant, how much strength does everyone gain!
    We are a revolutionary symphony
  Orchestra, beloved Chairman Mao, you are the greatest conductor. We will certainly move towards the
  Direction you guide, to forever powerfully play and sing for our great reality and ideal.

    毛主席和我们见了面
    文代大会浙江省代表　张颂南绿晶晶的葡萄
  结出了果实累累，一对对的飞燕
  从天外归来。在这里——中南海，毛主席和我们亲切的会
  见。两千多颗心啊，怎不像激动的琴弦！在这一瞬间，诗人有多少好的意境；在这一瞬间，画家有多少美的形象；在这一瞬间，音乐家有多少好的乐章；在这一瞬间，每一个人得到多么大的力
    量！我们是一支革命的交响乐
  队，敬爱的毛主席啊，您是最伟大的指挥者。我们一定朝着您指引的方
  向，为我们伟大的现实和理想永远雄浑地演奏、歌唱。
