    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 8th: The Albanian mining sector has achieved outstanding results and overfulfilled its production tasks for the first half of this year.

    According to statistics from the Ministry of Mines and Geology, by the end of June, workers in iron-nickel mines, coal mines, chromium mines, asphalt mines, and oil extraction industries had completed and overfulfilled their plans by 100% to 104%, respectively. Copper miners overfulfilled their original plan by 10%.

    Compared with the achievements of the first six months of this year and the same period last year, crude oil production increased by 41.3%, iron-nickel ore increased by 42.4%, and chromium and coal increased by 14.7% and 5.6%, respectively. In terms of tonnage, the first six months of this year increased by more than 91,900 tons of crude oil, more than 31,000 tons of iron-nickel ore, more than 17,000 tons of chromium ore, and more than 7,700 tons of coal compared with the first six months of last year.

    Many outstanding production units have emerged in the production competition, such as the Mbore-Drenove Coal Mining Company, which completed the production tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) six months ahead of schedule on June 28.

    At present, in order to greet the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party to be held in November this year with greater achievements, the broad masses of workers have proposed guarantees to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule. Some have revised the original production targets to ensure that they produce more products for the country. For example, oil workers, in addition to changing the original target of overproducing 4,000 tons of crude oil to 7,000 tons, have also decided to tap potential and reduce costs by 25 million leks. Drilling workers proposed to revise the original target of over-drilling 5,000 meters to 6,500 meters. Iron-nickel miners guarantee to overproduce 9,000 tons of ore this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 9th: The Bulgarian industrial front continues to fulfill its production plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule.

    All employees of the industrial sector in Sliven Oblast, one of Bulgaria's textile industry centers, completed their production plans for the first six months of this year on June 24. In the first half of this year, the employees of this oblast produced products worth approximately 50 million leva (Bulgarian currency) more than in the same period last year.

    All employees of the industrial enterprises in Sofia Oblast completed their production tasks for the first half of the year on June 29. The products they overproduced in the first half of this year are approximately equivalent to 22.2 million leva. The employees of many factories and enterprises have completed more than 110% of their plans for the first half of this year.

    The employees of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, which accounts for a quarter of the country's total industrial output value, also completed their production plans for the first half of this year a week ahead of schedule. In these six months, the value of the products they produced more than originally planned was approximately 90 million leva.

    The power industry also developed rapidly in the first half of this year. The power plants under the Bulgarian Industrial Committee's Power Bureau (generating 96% of the country's total power generation) completed their production plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule on June 29, generating 2.0445 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity for the country.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 5th: Many industrial and mining enterprises in Romania have completed their production plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule.

    Romanian metallurgical workers completed their production tasks for the first half of the year four days ahead of schedule. The Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine began to implement the production tasks for the second half of the year on June 18. Compared with last year, the utilization coefficient of the enterprise's blast furnaces increased by 12.7%, and the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased by 20%. This enterprise also saved the country more than 37 million lei (Romanian currency).

    Workers in oil drilling, iron ore, and refractory materials industries also completed their plans for the first half of the year four days ahead of schedule. Oil drilling workers widely promoted the advanced turbine drilling method. In the first half of this year, nearly twice as many oil wells were drilled with turbine drills as in the same period last year.

    Machine manufacturing workers have made great achievements in saving raw materials. After improving many parts of the tractor, the "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory reduced the weight of the tractor by 92 kilograms compared with the beginning of this year. This factory saved more than 600 tons of metal in the first half of the year.

    Many chemical factories and enterprises producing consumer goods have also completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The Navodari Sulfuric Acid and Fertilizer Plant recently created the highest labor productivity since it was put into production. In the workshops of the Iasi "Cesatura" Textile Factory, the labor productivity of some workers increased by 33%.

    兄弟国家工业战线高奏凯歌
    阿保罗许多企业提前完成上半年计划
    新华社地拉那8日电　阿尔巴尼亚矿业部门以优秀的成绩超额完成了今年上半年的生产任务。
    根据矿产地质部的统计，到6月底为止，铁镍矿、煤矿、铬矿、沥青矿和石油开采业的工人们都分别以100％到104％完成和超额完成了计划。铜矿工人则超额10％完成了原订计划。
    以今年头六个月的成就和去年同一时期相比，原油增产了41.3％，铁镍矿增产了42.4％，铬和煤分别增产了14.7％和5.6％。以吨数计算，今年头六个月比去年头六个月增产了九万一千九百多吨原油，三万一千多吨铁镍矿石，一万七千多吨铬矿石和七千七百多吨煤。
    在生产竞赛中出现了许多优秀的生产单位，如姆博雷—德雷诺维煤矿公司，已于6月28日提前六个月完成了第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的生产任务。
    目前广大工人为了以更大的成就迎接即将在今年11月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会，纷纷提出了提前完成全年计划的保证。有的并修订了原先的生产指标，保证要为国家生产更多的产品。如石油工人除将原订超额生产四千吨原油的指标改订成七千吨以外，并决定发掘潜力，降低成本二千五百万里克。钻探工人提出了将原有超额钻探五千米的指标修订为六千五百米。铁镍矿工人保证今年超额生产九千吨矿石。
    新华社索非亚9日电　保加利亚工业战线上不断提前完成今年上半年生产计划。
    保加利亚的纺织工业中心之一——斯利文州的工业部门的全体职工，在6月24日就完成了今年头六个月的生产计划。在今年上半年，这个州的职工比去年同期多生产了价值约为五千万列弗
  （保币）的产品。
    索非亚州工业企业部门的全体职工，在6月29日完成了上半年的生产任务。他们今年上半年超计划生产的产品，大约相当于二千二百万列弗。不少工厂企业的职工完成了今年上半年计划的110％以上。
    约占全国工业总产值四分之一的保加利亚首都索非亚市的职工，也提前一星期完成了今年上半年的生产计划。在这六个月中，他们比原计划多生产的产品的价值，约为九千万列弗。
    电力工业在今年上半年也有了迅速的发展。保加利亚工业委员会电力局所属的发电站（发电量占全国总发电量96％），在6月29日提前完成了今年上半年的生产计划，为国家生产了二十亿四千四百五十万度电。
    新华社布加勒斯特5日电　罗马尼亚许多工矿企业提前完成今年上半年生产计划。
    罗马尼亚冶金工人提前四天完成了上半年的生产任务。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂在6月18日就开始执行下半年的生产任务。同去年相比，这个企业的高炉利用系数提高了12.7％，平炉利用系数提高了20％。这个企业还为国家节约了三千七百多万列伊（罗币）。
    石油钻井、铁矿和耐火材料工业的工人也提前四天完成了上半年的计划。石油钻井工人广泛推广了先进的涡轮钻井法。今年上半年，用涡轮钻头所钻的油井差不多比去年同期增加了一倍。
    机器制造工人在节约原材料方面获得了很大的成绩。“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂在改进了拖拉机的许多部件后，拖拉机重量已比今年初减轻了九十二公斤。这个工厂在上半年共节约了六百多吨金属。
    许多化学工厂和生产消费品的企业也提前完成了上半年生产计划。纳伏达里硫酸和化肥厂最近创造了投入生产以来的最高劳动生产率。在雅西“采萨图拉”纺织厂，有些车间的工人的劳动生产率提高了33％。
