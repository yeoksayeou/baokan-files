　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th: Over two thousand Shanghai workers held a rally on the evening of the 11th to warmly welcome the Cuban Workers' Confederation delegation, which is currently visiting Shanghai.

　　The grand welcoming meeting was held at the Yangshupu Power Plant, which has a glorious tradition of fighting against U.S. imperialism. The plant was formerly a power plant of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company. In the years before liberation, the workers waged a long and heroic struggle against the American invaders. When Shanghai was liberated, the American invaders asserted that Chinese workers would be completely unable to manage this modern large-scale power plant. In February 1950, U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes brutally bombed the plant. But now, the workers not only successfully manage the factory, but also have greatly developed it.

　　At the welcoming meeting, Gu Shou-xiong, chairman of the power plant's trade union, on behalf of all the staff and workers, expressed a warm welcome and high respect to the heroic Cuban workers and the Cuban people. He said: The Cuban people, in order to defend the fruits of the revolution and smash the schemes and intrigues of U.S. imperialism, have waged a brave, tenacious, and unyielding struggle, severely打击打击 U.S. imperialism. We are always concerned about the development of the Cuban people's struggle and fully support this struggle. He said: We are standing on the same front as the Cuban people. In the struggle against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, we need to unite and support each other.

　　Odón Álvarez de la Campa, head of the Cuban Workers' Confederation delegation and Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, spoke amidst warm applause. On behalf of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, he extended warm greetings to the Shanghai workers and the Shanghai people. He said: U.S. imperialism has been attacking our country, imposing an economic blockade on us, and using this economic aggression as part of its preparation for armed intervention in our country. We are ready to fight. Militiamen from workers and university students are mastering weapons in order to resist and combat imperialist military intervention and armed aggression.

　　He said: The Chinese revolution has illuminated the path for the people of all colonies to struggle for national liberation, and the Cuban revolution has gained experience from the Chinese revolution. The struggle of the Chinese people is also the struggle of the Cuban people. We are fighting a common enemy, the worst enemy of mankind—U.S. imperialism. The Cuban people are not isolated in this struggle. We have the great Chinese people and the people of the whole world with us, and we will surely win victory. Finally, he shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" At this time, the atmosphere was high, and people shouted: "U.S. imperialism get out of Latin America!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan!" "Long live the friendship and solidarity of the Chinese and Cuban people!" "Down with U.S. imperialism, strive for lasting world peace!"

　　Shen Han, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Li Yunchuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Mechanical Workers' Union, and others attended last night's welcoming meeting. The Cuban Workers' Confederation delegation arrived in Shanghai by plane from Beijing on the afternoon of the 10th.

　　在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中相互支持
　　上海工人盛会欢迎古巴兄弟
    新华社上海12日电　两千多名上海工人11日晚上举行集会，热烈欢迎正在上海访问的古巴工人联合会代表团。
    盛大的欢迎会在具有反对美帝国主义的光荣斗争传统的杨树浦发电厂举行。这个厂的前身是美国资本的上海电力公司的发电厂，工人们在解放前的年代里，曾经与美国侵略者进行过长期的英勇斗争。上海解放时，美国侵略者断言中国工人根本无法管理这个现代化的大型发电厂，1950年2月，美制蒋机还对这个厂进行残酷的轰炸。但是现在，工人们不但成功地管理着这个工厂，而且大大发展了这个工厂。
    在欢迎会上，发电厂工会主席顾寿雄代表全厂职工向英雄的古巴工人和古巴人民表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。他说：古巴人民为了保卫革命胜利果实，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，进行了英勇顽强、不屈不挠的斗争，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义。我们时刻关怀着古巴人民斗争的发展，并且全力支持这个斗争。他说：我们是和古巴人民站在一条战线上的，在反对美帝国主义这一共同敌人的斗争中，我们需要相互团结，相互支持。
    古巴工人联合会代表团团长、古巴工人联合会对外关系书记奥东·阿伐莱斯·德·拉·坎巴在热烈的掌声中讲话。他代表古巴工人联合会向上海工人和上海人民致热烈的问候，他说：美帝国主义一直在进攻我国，对我国实行经济上的封锁，并把这种经济侵略作为准备武装干涉我国的一部分。我们准备斗争，工人和大学生中的民兵正在掌握武器，以便抵抗和打击帝国主义的军事干涉和武装侵略。
    他说：中国的革命照亮了各殖民地人民为争取民族解放而斗争的道路，古巴革命从中国革命中得到了经验。中国人民的斗争也是古巴人民的斗争，我们正在同一个共同的仇敌、人类最坏的敌人——美帝国主义进行斗争。古巴人民在这场斗争中不是孤立的，有伟大的中国人民和全世界人民和我们在一起，我们一定会取得胜利。最后他高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”这时全场情绪激昂，人们高呼：“美帝国主义从拉丁美洲滚出去！”“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去！”“中国和古巴人民的友谊和团结万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义，争取世界持久和平！”
    上海市总工会副主席沈涵、中国机械工会全国委员会主席李云川等出席了昨晚的欢迎会。古巴工人联合会代表团是10日下午从北京乘飞机到达上海的。
