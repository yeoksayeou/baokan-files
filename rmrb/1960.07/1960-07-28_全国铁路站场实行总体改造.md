    Overall Renovation of National Railway Stations and Yards Implemented
    More Than Seventy Stations Have Formulated Renovation Plans with Relevant Factories, Mines, and Ports; Some Have Completed the First and Second Phases
    Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: A large-scale movement for the overall renovation of railway stations and yards is vigorously unfolding across the country. According to incomplete statistics, more than seventy stations have already drafted overall renovation plans with relevant factories, mines, and ports. Some of them have been implemented in phases and have completed the first and second phases of the project.
    The overall renovation of railway stations and yards is an important aspect of the technological revolution in China's railway sector. It involves the railway, mining, factory, port, and other relevant parties, based on the spirit of communist cooperation, making unified arrangements, comprehensive planning, and gradual renovation of railway hubs, stations, freight yards, lines, loading and unloading facilities, storage facilities, and other related transportation equipment, to achieve a rational layout. This work is of extremely significant importance for expanding railway transportation capacity, improving transportation efficiency, and further meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    The experience of overall renovation of railway stations and yards was created by the railway and coal mine workers in Fuxin City under the leadership of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This experience has been promoted nationwide since March of this year and has quickly developed from the overall renovation of stations and yards in the railway and mining sectors to the overall renovation of stations and yards in the railway-factory, railway-port, and even urban special railway line sectors.
    Judging from the plans arranged in various places and some of the completed renovation projects, the overall renovation of railway stations and yards has many benefits:
    First, the overall renovation of stations and yards can effectively improve railway transportation capacity. For example, after the renovation of 95 special railway lines in Tianjin, the loading and unloading capacity can be increased by about 100%. After the renovation of the Xigu Freight Yard cargo line, the one-time vehicle capacity will increase by nearly threefold, and the cargo space will expand by more than 100%. The Hegang Coal Mine plans to dismantle the original two parallel stations and yards on both the railway and mine sides, and build a new unified shunting yard for the railway and mine, rationally adjust the lines, carry out partial line slope and straightening; and build and expand twelve large coal storage bunkers. After these renovations form a complete ground transportation system, the transportation capacity can be increased by about 100%, and the vehicle dwell time can be shortened by more than 50%. It can also achieve vehicle non-disassembly, train loading, and cyclical transportation. Achieve "three days of no production does not affect loading, and three days of no loading does not affect production." After Jilin Province completed 71 renovation projects, thirteen coal mines can increase coal storage by more than 70,000 tons, eight factories and mines can expand cargo space by more than 200, and twelve factories and mines can save more than 2,000 laborers.
    Second, since the overall renovation of stations and yards makes overall arrangements for the special railway lines of various factories and mining enterprises, "dismantling idle ones to supplement busy ones," it can further meet the needs of the great development of industrial and mining enterprises' production for railway transportation. In the overall renovation of special railway lines in Heilongjiang Province, the steel rails of the dismantled old lines can be used to build new railway lines for more than 40 enterprises that originally did not have special railway lines but urgently needed them, which is greatly conducive to accelerating the development of these enterprises' production.
    Third, it can make the railway station and yard equipment further adapt to and promote the development of one-stop transportation, and further develop the communist cooperation between production, supply, transportation, and sales departments. The overall renovation of railway-mine, railway-factory, railway-port, and urban special railway lines generally aims at direct entry and exit of entire trains and loading and unloading of entire trains. In terms of loading and unloading equipment, overhaul smooth coal storage bunkers and material storage bunkers; in terms of line equipment, eliminate or reduce vehicle handover, detours, or repeated transportation, and turn "dead lines" into "live lines," "short lines" into "long lines," and special lines into "shared lines"; at the same time, make the smooth and mechanized loading and unloading match the technological innovations in transportation and handling to form a continuous transportation line. In this way, loading, unloading, storage, and handling can be tightly linked to ensure the development of one-stop transportation.
    Fourth, since the overall renovation of railway stations and yards fully considers the rational use of urban short-distance transportation tools, it is conducive to the improvement of short-distance transportation capacity.
    The overall renovation of railway stations and yards in various places is carried out under the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, by combining production, supply, and sales departments, combining design, construction, and user units, and combining leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel. In the overall renovation of stations and yards, all localities adhere to the principle of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from reality, "dismantling the east to supplement the west," turning the useless into the useful, and turning the small use into the big use. Moreover, in the process of renovation, combined with the reform of transportation organization, a series of reforms have also been carried out in production, supply, transportation, and sales cooperation and transportation organization.

### 全国铁路站场实行总体改造

    发展产供运销各部门大协作　扩大运输能力满足生产跃进需要
    全国铁路站场实行总体改造
    七十多个车站同有关厂矿港口订出改造方案，有的已完成一、二期工程
    新华社27日讯　一个规模宏大的铁路站场总体改造运动，正在全国各地蓬勃展开。据不精确地统计，目前已经有七十多个车站同有关的工厂、矿山、港口，拟订了总体改造方案。其中有的已经分期施工，完成了第一、二期工程。
    铁路站场的总体改造工作，是我国铁路部门技术革命的一个重要方面。它是由铁路、矿山、工厂、港口等有关方面，根据共产主义大协作的精神，对铁路的枢纽、车站、货场、线路、装卸、储存以及其他有关的运输设备，进行统一安排，综合规划，逐步改造，以达到合理布局。这个工作对于扩大铁路运输能力，提高运输效率，进一步满足工农业生产大跃进的需要，具有极其重大的意义。
    对铁路站场进行总体改造的经验，是阜新市的铁路和煤矿职工，在中共阜新市委的领导下创造的。这个经验从今年3月以来在全国推广，已经很快地由路矿方面的站场总体改造，发展到路厂、路港以至城市专用线的站场总体改造。
    从目前各地安排的规划和某些已经完成的改造工程来看，对铁路站场进行总体改造的好处很多：
    第一，通过站场总体改造，可以有效地提高铁路运输能力。例如，天津市九十五条专用线经过改造后，可以使装卸能力提高一倍左右。其中西沽货场货物线改造后，一次容车能力增加将近三倍，货位扩大一倍多。鹤岗煤矿计划将路矿双方原有的两个平行站场拆除，新建一个路矿统一的调车场，合理调整线路，进行部分线路落坡和取直；新建和扩建十二个大型贮煤仓。经过这些改造形成一个完整的地面运输系统后，可以使运输能力提高一倍左右，车辆停留时间缩短一半多。并且可以实现车不解体、整列装车、循环运输。作到“三天不生产不影响装车，三天不装车也不影响生产”。吉林省完成改造工程七十一项后，十三个煤矿可以增加贮煤量七万多吨，八个厂矿扩大货位二百多个，十二个厂矿节省劳动力二千余名。
    第二，由于站场总体改造对各厂、矿企业专用线进行统筹安排，“拆闲补忙”，可以进一步满足工矿企业生产大发展对铁路运输的需要。黑龙江省在专用线总体改造中，用拆除的旧线路的钢轨，可以为四十多个原来没有专用线而又迫切需要专用线的企业，修建新的铁路线，大大有利于加速这些企业生产的发展。
    第三，可以使铁路站场设备进一步适应和促进一条龙运输的发展，进一步发展产、供、运、销各部门之间的共产主义大协作。路矿、路厂、路港和城市专用线总体改造，一般都以整列车直出直入、整列装卸为目标，在装卸设备方面大修滑溜化贮煤仓和贮料仓；在线路设备方面取消或减少车辆交接、迂回或重复运输，把“死线”变为“活线”，“短线”变为“长线”，专用线变为“共用线”；同时使装卸滑溜化和机械化与运搬方面的技术革新配套成龙，组成连续运输线。这样就可以使装、卸、贮、搬环环紧扣，保证一条龙运输的发展。
    第四，由于铁路站场总体改造，都充分考虑了城市短途运输工具的合理运用，因而有利于短途运输能力的提高。
    各地铁路站场的总体改造，是在省、市委的统一领导下，采取产、供、销各有关部门相结合，设计、施工和使用单位相结合，领导干部、工人和技术人员相结合的办法进行的。各地在站场总体改造中，都坚持自力更生、土洋结合的原则，从实际出发，“拆东补西”，变无用为有用，变小用为大用。而且在改造的过程中，结合运输组织的改革，对产、供、运、销大协作和运输组织也进行了一系列的改革。
