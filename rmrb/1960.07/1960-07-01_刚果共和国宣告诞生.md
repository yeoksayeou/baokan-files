    刚果共和国宣告诞生
    新华社30日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都利奥波德维尔今天上午十一点零七分（当地时间）礼炮齐鸣，宣告这个受比利时殖民主义者统治八十年之久的国家取得了独立。在黑非洲，又一个新国家——刚果共和国诞生了。
    在议会大厦举行了独立仪式。刚果共和国总统卡萨武布在宣布独立的讲话中向赢得独立而进行过斗争的刚果人民致敬。刚果第一届政府总理卢蒙巴和其他阁员都参加了独立仪式。参加仪式的还有外国使节和许多其他新独立的非洲国家代表。在议会大厦的外面，成千上万的刚果人唱着歌，跳着舞，庆祝他们的国家经过人民长期斗争获得独立。
    从29日午夜开始，刚果全国各地举行两天的庆祝独立的活动，欢乐的刚果人民在街道上载歌载舞，并且彻夜欢呼“独立万岁”。
    据报道，在刚果独立前夕，比利时政府为了讨好刚果人民，派出大批官员到刚果表示“友好”。比利时国王博杜安也赶到利奥波德维尔，并在刚果独立仪式上讲了话。比利时同刚果政府的代表在30日还联合签署了刚果的独立宣言。
    29日，刚果政府和比利时政府签订了一项“友好、援助和技术合作条约”。条约规定，双方“将就共同有关问题相互进行协商”。刚果的外交事务将由比利时外交部“协助进行”。在贸易上，两国保证不与任何一国签订比它们之间目前签订的更有利的条约。据一名比利时政府官员透露，条约还规定比利时在刚果的军事基地保持原状，直到有新的通知。
