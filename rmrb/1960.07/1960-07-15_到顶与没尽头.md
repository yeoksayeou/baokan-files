　　Reaching the Top Versus No End
　　Feng Haiyuan, Worker of Guangzhou Dahua Rubber Tire Factory

　　In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we often hear some people say: "It's almost there," "Innovation has reached the top"... They do not understand the principle that "the change and movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of truth in practice never ends either" ("On Practice"). Obviously, this is a metaphysical way of thinking.

　　Marxists believe that the development and change of the objective world has no end, that people's ability to understand and transform the world, and the discovery and development of science and technology are endless, and that the technical revolution is also unending. This is the evergreen dialectic.

　　Take the technical revolution of Guangzhou Common Food Processing Factory as an example. When this factory was first established, it only had two wooden pestles and one iron pot. Flour was ground with wooden pestles and transportation relied on shoulder carrying. Production was very backward, which was not in line with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In order to change this backward situation, in early 1959, the workers launched a vigorous technical revolution. They relied on their own efforts and adopted simple and crude methods, "dwarfs climbing stairs," and gradually reformed. After several months of effort, they eliminated the wooden pestles and iron pot, and achieved the mechanization of stir-frying rice and grinding flour, increasing production efficiency sevenfold. At this time, some people became complacent and thought that it was "almost there" and "couldn't go any further." After the anti-rightist struggle, the technical revolution took another step forward, realizing automated production. At this time, some people who lacked the spirit of continuous revolution were dazzled by this achievement, thinking that this time it could be considered "reached the top" and there was no possibility of further reform. However, the majority of the factory's employees, inspired by Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, recognized that the technical revolution develops from low-level to high-level and moves forward endlessly. They made persistent efforts, advanced victoriously, and continuously tapped production potential. On the basis of automation, they also realized electrical control production, entering 1961 ahead of schedule. The rapidly changing facts of this factory illustrate a truth: potential is infinite, and tapping it depends on people.

　　We are advocates of continuous revolution, and also advocates of the stages of revolutionary development. That is, while acknowledging that objective things are constantly developing and changing, we also acknowledge that under certain times, places, and conditions, the development of things has its relative stages. In this sense, the technical revolution cannot be achieved in one step. It must go through a process of development from low to high, from old to new, from simple to complex, and from indigenous to foreign. Just as we changed manual operation to mechanization, realized automation from mechanization, and realized remote control from automation, each step forward is a certain stage of the development of things. That is to say, from the perspective of development, the change and movement of things is infinite; from the perspective of each stage of the change of things, it is finite. For example, we come up with a method to reform a production equipment, which is finite; we think of another method to reform again, following this and continuing forward, which is infinite. Today we changed certain equipment, which is finite; tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we constantly reform, which is infinite again. The unity of opposites between finite and infinite is the objective law of the development and change of things.

　　Those who hold the "reaching the top" theory, their way of thinking is metaphysical. They regard things as isolated from each other and unchanging. They do not understand that people's ability to transform the objective world is endless. Using this kind of thinking to guide practice will inevitably lead to right-leaning conservatism. In order to criticize the "reaching the top" theory in production and ensure the sustained leap forward of socialist construction, we must learn to master Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism, establish the thought of continuous revolution, exert full effort, and be a conscious revolutionary in the technical revolution movement.

　　到顶与没尽头
　　广州大华胶轮厂工人　冯海沅
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，常常听到一些人说：“差不多了”、“革新到顶了”……。他们不了解“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”（《实践论》）的道理，显然，这是形而上学的思想。
    马克思主义者认为，客观世界的发展变化是没有尽头的，人们认识世界改造世界的能力，科学技术的发现和发展是无穷无尽的，技术革命也是无止境的。这是万古常青的辩证法。
    就举广州市共同食品加工厂的技术革命为例。这个厂在初办时只有两支木碓、一只铁锅，舂粉用木碓，运输靠肩挑，生产非常落后，同大跃进的形势很不合拍。为了改变这种落后状况，1959年初，工人就大闹技术革命。他们自力更生，采取因陋就简、“矮子上楼梯”，逐步改革的办法。经过几个月的努力，就革掉了木碓、铁锅，实现了炒米磨粉机械化，提高生产效率七倍。这时有些人就自满起来，认为
  “差不多”了，“不能再前进”了。经过反右倾以后，技术革命又向前跨进了一步，实现了自动化生产。这时某些缺乏不断革命思想的人又被这个成绩迷住了眼，认为这回可算“到顶”了，没有再改革的可能了。但这个厂的大多数职工，受了毛主席不断革命思想的启发，认识了技术革命是由低级到高级，永无止境地向前发展的。他们再接再厉，乘胜前进，不断挖掘生产潜力，在自动化的基础上又实现了电气控制生产，提前跨进了1961年。这个厂瞬息万变的事实，说明一个真理：潜力无穷尽，挖掘在于人。
    我们是不断革命论者，又是革命发展阶段论者。即是在承认客观事物不断发展变化的同时，又承认在一定的时间、地点、条件下，事物的发展有它相对的阶段性。从这个意义上来说，技术革命不能一步登天，它要经历由低到高、由旧到新、由简到繁、由土到洋的发展过程。就像我们将手工操作改为机械化，由机械化实现自动化，由自动化实现遥控化，每向前进展一步，都是事物发展的一定的阶段性。这就是说，从发展观点来看，事物的变化运动是无限的；从事物变化的每一阶段来看，则是有限的。比如我们想出了一个办法，改革了一项生产设备，这是有限的；再想办法再改革，循此继进，这是无限的。今天改了某些设备，这是有限的；明天、后天不断的改革，这又是无限的。有限和无限的对立统一，就是事物发展变化的客观规律。
    那些“到顶论”者，其思想方法是形而上学的。他们把事物看成是彼此孤立的、一成不变的，他们不懂得人们改造客观世界的能力是无穷无尽的。拿这种思想去指导实践，必然要犯右倾保守的错误。为了批判生产上的“到顶论”，保证社会主义建设的持续跃进，我们必须学会掌握马克思主义唯物辩证法，树立不断革命思想，鼓足干劲，在技术革命运动中，做一个自觉的革命者。
