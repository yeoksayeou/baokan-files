    Forge Fighting Spirit into a Fortress
    (Mongolian) Ulanbagan
    Not long ago, at a mass rally in the capital Beijing, a grand and magnificent demonstration against U.S. imperialism, I met a friend from Latin America. This friend from afar was visiting China for the first time, and it was also the first time he had participated in such a large-scale meeting. Although we did not speak the same language, from his actions and expressions, he, like us, was attending the conference with boundless hatred for U.S. imperialism. He clenched his white teeth tightly, his eyes flashing with extreme anger. He stood shoulder to shoulder with us, raised his firmly clenched fist, and shouted with us in different languages: "Down with U.S. imperialism!..." His shout was filled with excitement and indignation, as loud as a thunderous roar, mixed with the shouts of thousands of people; his fist stood straight above his head, becoming a wave stirred up by a torrent in an angry ocean composed of thousands of fists. He shouted until his voice was hoarse, wishing he could turn himself into a fierce flame, and build a Great Wall of fire with our hatred, burning U.S. imperialism to ashes. So, he raised both arms and clenched both fists. When we parted, he gave me some candy from Cuba, saying with abundant friendship and enthusiasm: "Wrap our sweetest and purest hearts in these candies and offer them to our Chinese friends! Forge our common hatred into ten-thousand-catty iron hammers to strike U.S. imperialism hard!"
    Every time I think of this meaningful acquaintance, I feel deeply and think widely. Yes, that was indeed what our friend felt in his heart. When he spoke those words from the bottom of his heart, how much deep feeling he had for us! How much admiration he had for our great motherland. People who have this kind of thought, no, no, it is by no means just him alone. Not only in Latin America, but also in Africa and among peace-loving people all over the world, they will all treat the Chinese people—the most loyal allies, supporters, and encouragers in the struggle against imperialism—in this way, expressing their friendship and selfless support to the 650 million people with the most beautiful and sweetest feelings. As for the enemy—the most ferocious enemy of the whole world, U.S. imperialism—they will angrily raise ten-thousand-catty iron hammers, stretch out giant swords to cut off the devil's claws, and replace everything with the word "smash."
    A beast is always a beast. Despite repeated setbacks to its schemes against world peace and the people, imperialism is always unwilling to give up. Now, U.S. imperialism is not only frantically preparing to invade Cuba, but also attempting to take advantage of the chaos in the Congo. No matter how U.S. imperialism tries to disguise itself, its aggressive nature will never change. The heroic people of Cuba and the Congo have realized in their own struggles that the survival of their countries and the independence of their nations are won through struggle and with blood. The people of Cuba and the Congo have already understood a veritable truth: one must never harbor any illusions about wolves. Only by taking the path of resolute struggle against imperialism and colonialism is there a way to survive.
    The struggles of the people of Cuba and Latin America, and the people of the Congo and Africa, against imperialism and colonialism, are by no means isolated. Asia and the people of the whole world are supporting you, especially the 650 million most loyal and reliable great Chinese friends are supporting your struggles. Fight bravely, fight, fight on! Spread the banner of battle across the entire Latin American sky, and let the bugle of battle resound throughout the entire African continent. Let the banners of battle and the bugles of battle connect into one, transforming into an incomparably powerful force. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Africa and Latin America, let us stir up a storm of revolutionary struggle of the people of the whole world, and bravely charge against imperialism headed by the United States!
    Here, I not only answer the Latin American friend I met, but also answer all Latin American and African friends: We dedicate the fusion of our friendly hearts and fighting will to the people of Latin America and Africa, to the people of Cuba and the Congo, and forge our will and the just struggle of the people of the world into an invincible fortress, resolutely overthrowing the common enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism!

    把斗志铸成堡垒
    蒙古族　乌兰巴干
    不久以前，我在首都北京举行的一次规模浩大、气势雄伟的反对美帝国主义大示威的群众大会上，结识了一位来自拉丁美洲的朋友。这位远方的朋友第一次来中国，而且，还是第一次参加这样浩大规模的会。我们彼此虽然语言不通，但是从他的行动和表情上看，他和我们同样，是以无限仇恨美帝国主义的心情来参加大会的，他紧紧地咬着洁白的牙齿，眼睛闪动着万分愤怒的光辉，他和我们肩并肩，高举握得坚实的拳头，和我们一起用不同的语言高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！……”他的喊声中带着激动和愤慨，响得如怒雷巨鸣，和千万群众的喊声混起来；他的拳头直竖在头顶，成为千万拳头组成的愤怒海洋中的激流冲起的一朵浪花。他喊哑了嗓子，恨不得把自己变成一团猛烈的火焰，和我们仇恨的烈火筑成万里火的长城，把美帝国主义烧成灰烬。于是，他把两只臂膀都举起来，握紧了两只拳头。我们分开的时候，他赠给我一些从古巴带来的糖果，友谊充沛饱含热情地说：“把我们最甜净的心，裹在这些糖果里，献给中国朋友！把我们共同的恨，怒铸成万斤铁锤去狠狠地打击美帝国主义！”
    每当我想起这次有意义的结识，感受很深，想的甚广。是的，那确实是我们朋友的心里话，他从内心里讲出这番话的时候，对我们带有多么深的心意！对我们伟大祖国多么羡慕。有这种想法的人，不，不，绝不只是他一个人。不仅仅是拉丁美洲，还有非洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民，他们将都会这样，对待朋友——反对帝国主义斗争的最忠实的同盟者、支持者、鼓舞者的中国人民，用最美最甜的心意表示他们对六亿五千万人民友谊和无私支援的回敬。对待敌人——全世界最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，就愤怒地举起万斤铁锤，就伸出斩断魔爪的巨剑，用“粉碎”两个字代替了一切。
    野兽永远是野兽，帝国主义对世界和平人民的阴谋，尽管一再受到挫败，但是总是不死心的。现在，美帝国主义一面更加疯狂地准备侵略古巴，一面又企图趁火打劫刚果。美帝国主义不管它怎样的去装扮，侵略的本性是永远不会变的。英勇的古巴人民、刚果人民在自己的斗争的过程中，认识到祖国的生存和民族的独立，是用斗争，用鲜血争取来的。古巴、刚果人民已经懂得了千真万确的一个真理：对豺狼绝不能抱有任何幻想。只有走坚决同帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的道路，才是活路。
    古巴和拉丁美洲人民，刚果和非洲人民的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，绝不是孤立的。有亚洲，有全世界人民在支援你们，特别是有六亿五千万最忠实可靠的伟大中国朋友在支持着你们的斗争，你们英勇顽强地战斗，战斗，战斗下去吧！把战斗的旗帜铺满整个拉丁美洲上空，把战斗的号角吹彻整个非洲的大地，战斗的旗帜和战斗的号角，连成一片，变成强大无比的力量，从大西洋到太平洋，从非洲和拉丁美洲，掀起全世界人民革命斗争的风暴，向以美国为首的帝国主义勇敢地冲击吧！
    在这里，我不仅向我结识的那位拉丁美洲朋友回答，而且，向所有的拉丁美洲、非洲的朋友们回答：我们把友谊的心和战斗意志溶合在一起，献给拉丁美洲、非洲人民，献给古巴、刚果人民，把我们的意志和全世界人民的正义斗争铸成战无不胜的堡垒，坚决打倒世界人民共同的敌人——美帝国主义！
