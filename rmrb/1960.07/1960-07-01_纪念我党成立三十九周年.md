East Asian winds and clouds, the mainland sinks (note), loyal and devoted to the people. Enduring hardships to seek the three islands, not going to the Western Paradise to seek scriptures. (note) In 1903, when I went to Japan, I lived with Hou Hongjian (Bao San) from Wuxi. He wrote a poem containing the line "East Asian winds and clouds, the mainland sinks," which was widely circulated and inspired those who heard it. Twenty years of the Reform and Revolution, successes and failures were intertwined. The October Revolution brought the "Marxist-Leninist immortals". With the founding of our Party, a new look emerged, and the people's revolution had a guideline to follow. Leadership depends entirely on Chairman Mao, and every achievement amazes the world. Who says that the great comrade is too lofty? The whole people are leaping forward as heroes. For sixty years, we have cherished fervent hopes, which are now vividly realized. Today, the winds and clouds over East Asia are high, and a tidal wave surges on the Pacific. Who can stop the rising sun of Japan? The song "The East is Red" resounds through the clouds.

    纪念我党成立三十九周年
　　吴玉章东亚风云大陆沉（注），忠心赤胆为人民。艰难困苦寻三岛，不到西天去取经。（注）一九○三年我到日本时，与无锡侯鸿鉴（保三）同住，他写了一首词，中有“东亚风云，
      大陆沉沉”，之句，曾传诵一时，闻者鼓舞。维新革命二十年，成功失败总相连。十月一声大炮响，送来马列赛神仙。我党成立面貌新，人民革命有遵循。领导全凭毛主席，每一功成举世惊。谁说大同志太高，全民跃进尽英豪。六十年来存热望，俨然出现在今朝。今日风云东亚高，太平洋上涌洪涛。扶桑日出谁能阻，东方红唱彻云霄。
