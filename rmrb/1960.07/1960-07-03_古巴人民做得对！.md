The Cuban government successively took over all the plants and equipment of the American Texaco Oil Company, Esso Mobil Oil Company, and the British-Dutch Shell Oil Company in Cuba on June 29 and July 1, severely打击 (dǎjī - struck) the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Cuban revolution by relying on their monopoly of oil in Cuba. The Cuban government's measure was right and well done!

The Cuban government's action to take over the Anglo-American oil companies is completely legal and reasonable. Before the victory of the Cuban revolution, these three oil companies wantonly plundered Cuba's oil resources and, together with some other foreign oil companies, monopolized Cuba's oil production, not only seizing huge profits but also controlling other economic sectors of Cuba. Last year, the Cuban government promulgated the Petroleum Law to abolish all concessions, established a petroleum commission to manage and develop oil production; restricted the business scope of some foreign oil companies that had obtained concessions, and stipulated that they must operate in accordance with the requirements of the Cuban government. However, the American oil companies used despicable methods such as filling oil wells and dismantling drilling equipment to undermine Cuba's oil production. Recently, the Cuban government imported crude oil from the Soviet Union at a price lower than that of American oil, but the American and British oil companies refused to refine it. This is obviously a deliberate act of sabotage. The Cuban government was compelled to take it over resolutely, giving the imperialists who dared to despise the Cuban people a due lesson.

As the President of the National Bank of Cuba, Guevara, pointed out, the deliberate sabotage of the American oil companies is in accordance with the American plan to invade Cuba. These American oil companies have always been tools for the United States to interfere in the Cuban revolution, and the British oil companies are also willing to act as accomplices. The American interventionists always try every vicious means to try to strangle the Cuban revolution. From their point of view, using the oil companies in Cuba to undermine Cuba's oil production will create huge economic difficulties for Cuba. But can the Cuban people, who have stood up, just stand by and let the imperialists bully them without resistance? American imperialism and its accomplices have miscalculated again this time.

The Cuban government's action to take over the Anglo-American oil companies once again shows the Cuban people's determination to defend the revolution. No threat from American imperialism can subdue the Cuban people; on the contrary, every provocation will inevitably be met with resolute counterattacks. Premier Castro is right in saying: "Our people have enough courage and dignity to resist for enough time, until this unjust, exploitative, and tyrannical empire is overthrown." The Cuban people's spirit of contempt for American imperialism is forever admired by the Chinese people, and their every struggle against American imperialism will be supported by the Chinese people. We firmly believe that in the face of the strong and unyielding Cuban people, all the interventionist conspiracies of American imperialism will be shamefully defeated.

    古巴人民做得对！
    本报评论员
  古巴政府于6月29日和7月1日，先后接管了美国德士古石油公司、埃索美孚油公司和英荷壳牌石油公司在古巴的所有厂房和设备，严重地打击了帝国主义凭借它们对古巴石油的垄断来破坏古巴革命的阴谋。古巴政府这一措施做得对，做得好！
    古巴政府接管美英石油公司的行动是完全合法合理的。在古巴革命胜利以前，这三家石油公司肆意掠夺古巴的石油资源，和其他一些外国石油公司垄断了古巴的石油生产，不仅攫取了巨额的利润，而且还控制了古巴其他的经济部门。古巴政府去年颁布了废除一切租让地的石油法，设立石油委员会管理和发展石油生产；对于一些已经取得租让权的外国石油公司，限制它们的经营范围，规定必须按照古巴政府的要求进行经营。但是美国石油公司却用填死油井、拆走钻探设备等卑鄙手法来破坏古巴的石油生产。最近古巴政府以低于美国石油的价格从苏联进口了原油，美国和英国的石油公司竟拒绝提炼。这显然是蓄意进行破坏。古巴政府迫不得已，毅然予以接管，给予了敢于藐视古巴人民的帝国主义者以应有的教训。
    正如古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉所指出的，美国石油公司的故意捣乱是根据美国侵略古巴的计划行事的。这些美国石油公司一直是美国干涉古巴革命的工具，而英国石油公司也甘心充当帮凶。美国干涉者总是想尽各种恶毒的办法企图制古巴革命于死命。从他们看来，利用在古巴的石油公司破坏古巴的石油生产，将能给古巴制造巨大的经济困难。但是已经站起来了的古巴人民难道就只能束手任由帝国主义的欺侮、不得反抗吗？美帝国主义和它的帮凶这回又打错算盘了。
    古巴政府接管美英石油公司的行动再一次表明了古巴人民保卫革命的决心。美帝国主义的任何威胁都不能够使古巴人民屈服，相反的每一桩挑衅都必然要受到坚决的回击。卡斯特罗总理说得对：“我国人民有足够的勇气和尊严来在足够的时间内进行抵抗，一直抵抗到这个不义的、剥削成性的、蛮横的帝国被打倒为止”。古巴人民这种蔑视美帝国主义的气概永远为中国人民所敬佩，他们的每一个反对美帝国主义的斗争都会得到中国人民的支持。我们坚信，在坚强不屈的古巴人民面前，美帝国主义的一切干涉阴谋都将会遭到可耻的失败。
