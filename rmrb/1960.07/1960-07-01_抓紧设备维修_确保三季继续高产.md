(Our Correspondent, Anshan, 30th) While focusing on steel production, Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) plants and mines are closely centering on key production areas and greatly pushing forward preparations for the third quarter, launching a mass equipment maintenance campaign of major inspection, major appraisal, major assault, and major preparation. To date, over ten thousand key items throughout the company have been properly arranged and promptly resolved according to their importance and urgency.

Steelmaking heroes fighting on the open-hearth furnaces, having established the idea that the furnace is steel and protecting the furnace body means producing more steel, protect the furnace body to ensure high temperature, longevity, large charge, fast charging, and fast smelting in the open-hearth furnace. In June, the company held a broadcast conference at the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant to exchange advanced experiences in furnace protection from Open-Hearth Furnace No. 6. After workers at twenty-four large open-hearth furnaces systematically studied the experiences of this furnace in fully leveraging the role of the Party branch as the core, conscientiously applying the "three diligences, two accurates, one fierceness" and "four no-goes," production steadily improved, the lifespan of furnace bodies generally increased by more than a quarter compared to the past, charging volume generally increased, and smelting time was greatly shortened. Maintenance workers in the Ironmaking Plant, aiming at the key issue of insufficient air volume, launched a leak detection and plugging campaign, conducting meticulous inspections and supervision of all air ducts. Currently, they have plugged forty-seven air leaks that were detected. Under the condition of ensuring uninterrupted production, the factory's maintenance workers also utilize every gap to pre-repair each furnace. To achieve planned pre-repairs, workers at the Rough Rolling Plant have established a system for all equipment and components, following the regulations of large, medium, and small: large components are inspected every ten days, medium components are inspected weekly, and small components are inspected at shift handover, greatly improving the integrity rate of equipment.

In the production and supply of spare parts and components, workers in various mechanical systems conducted door-to-door visits, reviews, and prioritization, carried out "four major, three timelys," and dragon-type collaborative performance competitions between machine tools. They also adopted the "three fixes" method—fixed person, fixed project, fixed time—to ensure the supply of spare parts for equipment maintenance. Currently, Ansteel is mobilizing various spare parts processing and equipment maintenance units to summarize advanced experiences related to improving the quality of spare parts, increasing equipment utilization, and ensuring safe operation, in order to promote them separately.

(Our Correspondent, Chongqing, 30th) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company plants such as steelmaking, rolling, and ironmaking, are actively overhauling equipment and vigorously carrying out mass furnace protection and equipment maintenance, preparing powerful "weapons" for continued high production in the third quarter.

Since the second half of the month, the entire company, based on the principle of "grasping production with one hand and preparation with the other," while seizing the last few days of production in the first half of the year, has been greatly pushing forward preparations for the third quarter. Each plant first universally inspected open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, rolling mills, and various mechanical equipment, conducting planned adjustments and repairs. The company's equipment system also organized "three-way combination" inspection teams to go deep into each plant to comprehensively inspect key equipment, assisting each plant in eliminating equipment defects and imbalances in various processes. Currently, repair workers are concentrating their efforts on repairing the 650mm rolling mill at the small rolling mill. After eliminating defects in this equipment, output can be more than doubled. At the same time, major repairs have also begun on the large rolling mill according to plan. In addition, Blast Furnace No. 3 and other equipment have also been overhauled at this time.

Carrying out mass equipment maintenance work is an important measure that each plant is currently actively seizing. Recently, many factories have mobilized workers to conduct major debates on how to maintain equipment well, educating workers to cherish their production "weapons" like "soldiers cherish their guns," and have established furnace protectors and equipment maintenance personnel in production teams, establishing various systems. Workers have also actively come up with many measures to maintain equipment well. Repair workers regularly carry tools, going deep into production workshops, achieving "general equipment patrol inspections, key equipment on guard duty," ensuring timely repairs. The No. 1 Open-Hearth Steelmaking Plant tightly grasped the key to furnace protection, on the one hand organizing workers to carry out major airing of views and suggestions, and on the other hand establishing three-level inspection teams, furnace protection daily reports, insisting on implementing furnace protection regulations and furnace-by-furnace inspections, shift-by-shift appraisals, daily evaluations, and three-day consultations inspection system. These measures have played a significant role in extending furnace life and shortening smelting time.

While strengthening equipment maintenance, the company's equipment system has also universally seized the manufacture of spare parts. Aiming at the problems of insufficient mechanical repair forces and mechanical spare parts not keeping up with production and repair needs, they put forward the slogan "production workers engage in maintenance, repair workers engage in manufacturing," teaching repair techniques to production workers and mobilizing them to maintain themselves and carry out general repairs. Mechanical repair workers free up their strength to, on the one hand, engage in large-scale indigenous, simple, and specialized equipment to increase mechanical manufacturing capacity; and on the other hand, produce urgently needed mechanical spare parts.

(Our Report) Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are seizing the preparation work for the third quarter, striving to complete the production plans for major products such as steel, iron, and steel materials ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.

In the second half of June, after analyzing the situation in the third quarter, leaders of Shijingshan Steel believed that, with high temperatures and heavy rain in the third quarter, to strive for even greater high production on the basis of the high production of the second quarter and to change the "routine" of declining production in the summer season over the years, they must complete the task with an even higher revolutionary spirit. After heated discussions, the broad masses of workers were determined to make persistent efforts, summon up greater enthusiasm, overcome high temperatures and heavy rain, increase the daily output level of steel, iron, and steel materials by 10% to 20% compared to the second quarter respectively, and make sure that the iron is good iron, the steel is good steel, and the material is good material, striving for an all-round leap forward.

Currently, the company's leadership is mobilizing the masses, greatly seizing equipment maintenance, spare parts manufacturing, and raw material reserves, preparing sufficient material conditions for production in the third quarter. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient repair forces, the company's mechanical repair department workers launched a movement to double the repair and manufacturing force. Operating workers learn maintenance, repair workers learn manufacturing, and in June alone, they rushed to produce more than 1,000 tons of spare parts and components for the third quarter. Detailed inspections and arrangements have also been made for the overhaul of major equipment such as blast furnaces and converters. The workers also made a batch of lathes themselves, strengthening the repair force. The raw material supply and production departments seized the raw material reserves for the rainy season. Most of the measures for preventing heatstroke and cooling down have also been completed.

(Our Report, Tianjin, 30th) Steel plants in Tianjin are mobilizing the masses to carry out equipment maintenance and repairs, preparing conditions for the sustained leap forward in steel production in the third quarter.

The Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, led by the Party Committee Secretary and the Plant Director, formed a specialized visiting group to go deep into all eight branch plants in the plant, mobilizing the masses to carry out equipment maintenance and repairs. The branch plants not only promptly discovered equipment defects, but also made spare parts themselves. For example, the 150cm and 200cm herringbone gears used in steelmaking equipment were previously processed by external factories. This time, the workers modified machine tools themselves to mill the gears, thus ensuring the timely maintenance and repair of the equipment.

The No. 3 Steel Plant, Tianjin's oldest converter steel plant, has many outdated equipment. In order to achieve a sustained and great leap forward in steel production, a thorough overhaul was also carried out in late May. This overhaul project was huge, including the replacement of some equipment in the steelmaking furnace and ironmaking furnace, the major overhaul of the entire electrical equipment and overhead crane and furnace pit, the lengthening of the overhead crane walkway, and the construction of a 400-meter-long internal road. The project was large and time was tight, but under the direct command of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, the Hexi District Party Committee, the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau, and the Factory Party Committee, all parties provided support to fully protect steel. As a result, the entire major overhaul task was completed in ten days. Thirty-four factories in the city sent more than 1,000 technical workers of various trades, carrying luggage, bringing tools, and rushing to the overhaul site; and more than 1,300 people from seventeen units including government agencies, schools, shops, and people's communes participated in the voluntary labor of the steel protection battle on the construction site.

After equipment maintenance and repair, each steel plant is well-manned and well-equipped. Steelworkers put forward a loud slogan: we must better exert the power of these equipments, produce more steel, and produce good steel.

    下半月以来，全公司都根据一手抓生产、一手抓准备的原则，在抓紧上半年最后几天的生产的同时，大抓第三季度的生产准备工作。各厂首先普遍检查了平炉、高炉、轧钢机和各种机械设备，进行了有计划的调整和检修。公司设备系统还组织了“三结合”的检查小组，深入各厂全面检查关键性的设备，协助各厂消除设备缺陷和各工序不平衡的矛盾。现在，检修工人正集中全力检修小型轧钢厂的六百五十毫米的轧钢机。这台设备消除缺陷后，产量可提高一倍以上。与此同时，大型轧钢机也开始了有计划的中修。此外，三号高炉和其他设备，也在这时进行了检修。
    开展群众性的设备维护工作，是目前各厂正在积极抓紧的一项重要措施。最近，很多工厂都发动工人开展了怎样维护好设备的大辩论，教育工人要像“战士爱枪”一样的爱护自己的生产“武器”，并在生产小组中专门设立了护炉员、设备维护员，建立了各种制度。工人们也主动的想出了很多维护好设备的措施。检修工人们经常带着工具，深入生产车间，做到“一般设备巡逻检查、重点设备站岗放哨”，保证及时检修。第一平炉炼钢厂紧紧抓住了护炉的关键，一面组织工人开展大鸣大放，提出意见，一面建立三级检查组，护炉日报，坚持贯彻护炉规程和炉炉检查、班班检定、天天一评比、三天一会诊的检查制度。这些措施对延长炉子寿命，缩短冶炼时间起了很大的作用。
    在加强设备维修的同时，公司设备系统还普遍抓紧了生产备件的制造。他们针对机修力量不足、机械备品跟不上生产和检修需要的问题，提出了“生产工人搞维修、检修工人搞制造”的口号，将检修技术教给生产工人，发动他们自己维护和进行一般的检修。机修工人腾出力量来，一面大搞土、简、专设备，增加机械制造能力；一面生产急需的机械备件。
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司职工大抓第三季度的生产准备工作，力争提前全面完成三季度钢、铁、钢材等主要产品生产计划。
    6月下半月，石钢领导上在分析了三季度的形势后认为，第三季高温多雨，要在第二季高产的基础上争取更大的高产，改变历年暑季生产下降的“常规”，就必须以更高革命风格去完成任务。广大职工经过热烈讨论，决心再接再厉，鼓起更大的干劲，战胜高温多雨，使钢、铁、钢材的日产水平比第二季度再分别提高10％到20％，作到铁是好铁，钢是好钢，材是好材，争取全面跃进。
    目前，这个公司的领导正在发动群众，大抓设备维修、备品制造和原材料的储备，为第三季度生产准备充足的物质条件。为了克服修理力量不足的困难，这个公司机修部门的职工展开了一个修造力量翻一番的运动。运行工人学维修，修理工人学制造，6月份一个月就为三季度赶制了一千多吨备品、备件。高炉、转炉等主要设备的检修，也进行了详细的检查和安排。工人们还自己动手制造一批车床，壮大了修理力量。原料供应和生产部门抓紧了雨季原材料的储备工作。防暑降温的措施也已大部完成。
    本报天津30日电　天津市各钢厂发动群众进行设备维护检修，为第三季度钢产量持续跃进准备条件。
    天津市第一钢厂由党委书记和厂长挂帅，组成专业访问小组，深入全厂八个分厂，发动群众进行设备维护检修。各分厂不仅及时发现了设备缺陷，而且还自己动手赶制备件。如炼钢设备用的一百五十厘米和二百厘米人字牙轮，过去都是靠外厂加工，这次，职工们自己动手改装机床，铣制牙轮，因而保证了设备的及时维护和检修。
    天津市最老的转炉炼钢厂第三钢厂，许多设备已经陈旧，为实现钢产量的持续大跃进，在5月下旬也进行了彻底大检修。这次检修工程巨大，包括炼钢炉、化铁炉的部分设备更新，整个电器设备和天车、炉坑的大修，加长天车走道和新建四百米长的厂内马路。工程大，时间紧，但是在中共天津市委、河西区委、市冶金局和工厂党委的直接指挥下，八方支援，全力保钢，结果十天就完成了全部大检修任务。市内有三十四个工厂派出了一千多名各工种的技术工人，携行李，带工具，开赴检修现场；还有机关、学校、商店、人民公社等十七个单位的一千三百多人在工地参加了保钢大战的义务劳动。
    经过设备维护检修后，各钢厂兵强马壮，武器精良，炼钢工人们提出了响亮口号：一定要更好地发挥这些设备的威力，多炼钢，炼好钢。（附图片）
