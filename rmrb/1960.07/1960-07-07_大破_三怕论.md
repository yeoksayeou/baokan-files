    Thoroughly Break the "Three Fears" Theory
    Shen Xiaolin, Chi Xiangkang, Yuan Yunlin, Yu Jiamin, Workers of Shanghai Film Machinery Factory
    In the technical revolution movement, we must thoroughly break the "Three Fears" theory so that people's minds can be liberated, superstitions can be eliminated, and the technical revolution can advance triumphantly. What are the "three fears" that a few people have regarding the technical revolution? First, they fear change. This mostly appears at the beginning of the technical revolution. They say: "There's going to be another transformation! So much mechanization and automation, it's really too many tricks, transforming endlessly." Second, they fear difficulties. This mostly appears during the technical revolution movement. They say: "It's difficult! It's difficult! Really asking for trouble, deliberately making things difficult." Third, they fear failure. This mostly appears when a certain technical innovation is about to be successfully tested, but encounters some setbacks. They say: "Forget it, forget it, there's no hope," or they say: "Be careful, causing a big mess, we can't take the responsibility!" Only when the innovation project is completed does the "Three Fears" theory come to an end and quietly retreat. However, its ghost is still present, and when tackling other innovation projects, it appears again, inevitably clamoring again. Therefore, we must thoroughly break the "Three Fears" theory, and shout loudly: Fear not change, fear not difficulties, fear not failure, to pave the way for continuous technical innovation and continuous revolution!
    Why are we not afraid of change? Dialectics tells us: Everything in the world is constantly moving, changing, and developing, and this change and development cannot be stopped by anyone. Therefore, we should not be afraid of changes in things, but should consciously promote changes in things. "Fearing change" is a metaphysical viewpoint and is wrong. We welcome development and change because we are the working class, and the working class is never satisfied with the status quo, but constantly promotes the progress of history. In the old society, we were beasts of burden, so we had to make revolution, to have a world-shaking change. After liberation, we changed from suffering to happiness, from slaves to masters, and overthrew the capitalist system of exploitation. We workers directly became the masters of the enterprise. What a great change this is! The Great Leap Forward is another great change, which will rapidly transform our country from a "poor and blank" country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The technical revolution is also a great change, which mechanizes manual operations and automates mechanical operations. It not only promotes the continuous leap forward of production, but also improves our working conditions. In short, our country is undergoing one transformation after another, each transformation is better than the last, the benefits are endless, and the gains are immeasurable. We are excited, we are proud, because of this "ever-changing, infinitely changing." It is through such continuous changes and continuous revolutions that we will ultimately realize our great ideal - communism. To change, to make revolution, we must have drive. Lacking spirit and being timid, nothing can be changed. Some people think: "Let others make big changes, I'll just be comfortable." This is the worldview of a lazy person, not the worldview of the working class.
    Why are we not afraid of difficulties? Dialectics tells us: "There is nothing that does not contain contradictions; without contradictions, there is no world." Contradictory struggles "determine the life of all things and promote the development of all things" ("On Contradiction"). Fearing difficulties is avoiding contradictions, which is also a metaphysical viewpoint and is wrong. Doing anything requires fighting difficulties, and only by overcoming difficulties can we achieve success. The great victory of China's democratic revolution and socialist revolution was achieved by overcoming a series of difficulties. The Great Leap Forward was also achieved by overcoming great difficulties, such as old machinery and equipment, lack of experience in trial production and design, and insufficient raw materials. For example, the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory achieved great success by overcoming the great difficulty of "small factories processing large parts" and creating the method of "ants gnawing at bones." Comrade Min Changyuan, a youth red banner assault team member of our factory, also achieved success in creating the cutting-edge product "stereoscopic camera" by overcoming many difficulties such as no drawings, no technical data, and no physical samples. He was not intimidated by the difficulties. He started from scratch, empty-handed, and overcame the difficulties with a dauntless spirit, finally achieving victory and filling a gap in China's film industry. It can be seen that to achieve great victory, we must overcome great difficulties; only by overcoming great difficulties can we have great victory. People who fear difficulties feel a lot of pressure when they encounter difficulties. Yes, difficulty is a pressure, but for those who are "not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth," and have soaring revolutionary drive, it can be transformed into motivation. The greater the pressure, the greater the drive. The fact is that none of the heroic pioneers in the technical revolution storm did not face difficulties, rush forward, and work hard to create many amazing miracles. As the saying goes: "The more you fear difficulty, the more difficult it becomes," "Afraid of difficulty, difficulty upon difficulty." Difficulty will not disappear or shrink on its own because you fear it; the more you fear it, the bigger it becomes, crushing you like Mount Tai. Therefore, fearing difficulty is useless; only by doing can you overcome difficulty. Chairman Mao told us that we should despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically. Only by despising difficulties can we "make high mountains bow their heads and make rivers give way," and can we show the fearless nature of our working class.
    Why are we not afraid of failure? Chairman Mao said: "In the socialist cause, it is only fantasy to think that success can be easily achieved without going through arduous twists and turns and without making great efforts." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") What is failure? Failure is when the subjective does not conform to the objective. Materialist dialectics tells us: The subjective does not conform to the objective all at once, but there is a process of repetition and twists and turns. People who fear failure believe that all work, struggles, and experiments must achieve victory all at once, without encountering setbacks, without encountering setbacks, and can only be a linear development; this idea does not conform to materialist dialectics. We believe that "failure is the mother of success." Because if something fails, it forces you to think, to summarize experiences and lessons, to figure out its regularity, and then transform failure into success. The so-called "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit" is the meaning of this saying. The objective laws of things can be understood and mastered and used by people. But it must go through constant practice, from not understanding to understanding, from understanding less to understanding more. When you basically understand it, you can master and use it to benefit mankind. Experimentation, failure, re-experimentation... until success, is a process of understanding the objective laws of things. Science and technology reach their peak in this process of understanding. Wang Linhe of Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory, who developed the high-voltage bridge, endured the test of 370 failures, and finally succeeded in the 371st attempt, is a best illustration. After so many failures, Wang Linhe's scientific knowledge and practical experience have also become richer. Now, Xie Wen has improved the high-voltage bridge based on Wang Linhe's work. This also shows that science and technology can be continuously reformed and continuously improved with people's continuous understanding. Min Changyuan of our factory also failed seven or eight times in the trial production of the "stereoscopic camera", and finally created it. He said well: "Failure is nothing." Experimentation, failure, re-experimentation, re-failure... until finally achieving success, this is the logic of the technical revolution and any cutting-edge product. Whether or not you are afraid of failure is a touchstone to test whether a person has truly mustered up his energy, and to test whether a person has tenacious will and perseverance. People who are afraid of failure are often not full of drive, or they are worried about gains and losses, afraid of losing face, and afraid of being unfavorable to themselves. They are concerned about personal
   "insurance," so that they can be less responsible for future investigations. However, the more you care about personal "insurance," the less insured you are; the more you care about personal "face," the more "ugly" your face becomes. It can be seen that fearing failure and not daring to make a big technical innovation is also the fault of the bourgeois world outlook, which we must break.
    In summary, making revolution is making change. If you want to change, you must transform. If you transform, there must be difficulties. With difficulties, there are often failures. This is inevitable. We are revolutionaries, we like change, we want ever-changing, infinitely changing; we are promoters, we love to find difficulties, the more difficulties, the greater the energy; we are optimists, we are not afraid of failure, we firmly believe that after failure, we will be able to succeed. We must continuously "transform" and thoroughly "transform"; when we encounter difficulties, we will immediately go up! Rush! Do! We must make difficulties bow their heads and give way! If we fail, we will make persistent efforts, struggle, fail, re-struggle, re-fail... until victory. We will never stop until we win complete victory.

### 大破“三怕论”

    大破“三怕论”
    上海电影机械厂工人　沈筱林　池祥康　袁云林　俞加民
    在技术革命运动中，必须大破“三怕论”，人们的思想才能解放，迷信才能破除，技术革命才能高歌猛进。少数人对于技术革命有哪“三怕”呢？一是怕变化。这大多出现在技术革命刚开始。他们说：“又要化了，什么机械化、自动化，真是花样太多，化个没完。”二是怕困难。这大多出现在技术革命运动过程中，他们说：“难呀！难呀！真是自找麻烦，有意为难。”三是怕失败。这大多出现在某项技术革新即将试验成功，但碰到了一些挫折的时候。他们说：“算了，算了，没有什么希望了”，或者说：“千万要当心，闹出大乱子，责任负不起呀！”直到革新项目完成时，“三怕论”才算收场，悄悄退走。可是，它阴魂未散，在搞另一些革新项目时，它又出现了，不免又要叫嚷一番。所以，我们必须彻底大破“三怕论”，要大声高呼：不怕变化，不怕困难，不怕失败，为不断革新技术、不断革命鸣锣开道！
    为什么我们不怕变化呢？辩证法告诉我们：世界上一切事物都在不断运动、变化和发展，这种变化和发展是任何人都阻挡不了的。因此，我们不应该怕事物的变化，而是要自觉地促进事物的变化。“怕变化”，是形而上学的观点，是错误的。我们欢迎发展和变化，因为我们是工人阶级，工人阶级决不满足于现状，而要不断地推动历史前进。在旧社会，我们是牛马，因此要闹革命，要来一个天翻地复的大变化。解放了，我们从苦难变为幸福，由奴隶变为主人，推翻了资本主义的剥削制度，我们工人直接当了企业的主人。这该是多么大的一个变化！大跃进又是大变化，它将高速度地把我国由一个“一穷二白”的国家变为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。技术革命也是大变化，它使手工操作机械化，机械操作自动化。它不仅促进了生产的持续跃进，而且改善了我们的劳动条件。总之，我们国家是一化接一化，一化胜一化，好处说不完，得益无法量。我们兴奋，我们自豪，就在于这个“千变万化，变化无穷”。正是通过这样不断的变化，不断的革命，我们将最终地实现我们的伟大理想——共产主义。要变化，要革命，就要有干劲。精神不振，畏畏缩缩，是什么也变不起来的。有些人想：“人家去闹大变化，我自己来个舒服化。”这是懒汉的世界观，不是工人阶级的世界观。
    为什么我们不怕困难呢？辩证法告诉我们：“没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”矛盾斗争“决定一切事物的生命，推动一切事物的发展”（《矛盾论》）。怕困难就是回避矛盾，这也是形而上学的观点，是错误的。做任何事情，都需要与困难作斗争，只有战胜困难，才能取得成功。我国民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，就是战胜了一连串的困难而取得的。大跃进也是在克服大困难、克服了机器设备旧、试制和设计缺乏经验、原材料不足等等困难而取得的。比如上海建设机器厂就是由于克服了“小厂加工大部件”的这个大困难，创造了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法而取得了大胜利的。我厂青年红旗突击手闵长远同志创制尖端产品“立体摄影机”，也是克服了一无图纸、二无技术资料、三无实样等许多困难而取得成功的。他并没有被困难所吓倒。他是赤手空拳、白手起家，以大无畏的精神战胜困难，终于取得了胜利，为我国电影事业填补了一个空白点。由此可见，要取得大胜利，就要克服大困难；只有克服大困难，才能有大胜利。怕困难的人，一碰上了困难，就感到压力很大。是的，困难是个压力，但是，它对那些“天不怕，地不怕”，有着冲天革命干劲的人来说，却能转化为动力，压力越大，干劲越足。事实正是这样，在技术革命大风暴中的英雄闯将，没有一个不是见困难就上、就闯、就干，才创造出许多惊人的奇迹来。俗语说：“见难就怕，越怕越难”，
  “害怕困难，难上加难”。困难不会因你怕它而不存在或自行缩小，你越是怕，它却变得越来越大，像泰山一样把你压倒。因此，怕困难是没有用的，只有干，才能战胜困难。毛主席告诉我们，在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难。只有藐视困难，才能“让高山低头，让河水让路”，才能表现我们工人阶级大无畏的本色。
    为什么不怕失败？毛主席说：“在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）失败是什么？失败就是主观不符合客观。唯物辩证法告诉我们：主观不是一下子就符合客观的，而是有一个反复、曲折的过程的。怕失败的人，认为一切工作、斗争、试验都必须一下子就取得胜利，不能碰钉子，不能有挫折，只能是直线式的发展；这种想法是不符合唯物辩证法的。我们认为“失败是成功之母”。因为搞一件事情失败了，就逼你去想，去总结经验教训，去摸出它的规律性，然后使失败转化为成功。所谓“吃一堑，长一智”，就是这个意思。事物的客观规律是可以认识的，可以被人掌握和运用的。但要经过不断的实践，从不认识到认识，从认识得少到认识得多。等到基本上认识以后，就能够掌握和运用它来为人类谋福利了。试验、失败，再试验……以至于成功，就是一个认识事物客观规律的过程。科学技术也就在这种认识过程中达到它的高峰。沪光仪表厂王林鹤试制高压电桥，经受了三百七十次失败的考验，终于在第三百七十一次取得了成功，就是一个最好的说明。经过这样多次的失败，王林鹤的科学知识和实践经验也越来越丰富了。现在，谢文又在王林鹤的基础上，改进了高压电桥。这又说明，科学技术是随着人们的不断认识而可以不断改革、不断完善的。我厂闵长远试制“立体摄影机”也失败过七、八次，最后终于创造出来了。他说得好：“失败不算什么”。试验，失败，再试验，再失败……以至最后取得成功，这是技术革命以及任何尖端产品产生的逻辑。怕不怕失败，这是考验一个人是不是真正鼓足了干劲，考验一个人有没有顽强的意志和毅力的试金石。怕失败的人，往往是干劲不十足，或者是患得患失，怕失去面子，怕对个人不利。他们关心的是对个人
  “保险一些，将来查责任可以少负一些”。可是，越计较个人的“保险”就越不保险；越是计较个人“面子”，越是“面子不好看”。可见，怕失败而不敢大闹技术革新，也是资产阶级世界观在作怪，我们必须破除它。
    综上所说，干革命就是闹变革，要变就要化，有化必有难，有难常有败，这是必然性。我们是革命派，喜欢变化，要千变万化，变化无穷；我们是促进派，爱找困难，困难越多，劲头越大；我们是乐观派，不怕失败，坚信失败之后，必能胜利。我们要不断地“化”，彻底地“化”；碰到困难，立即就上！就闯！就干！一定要叫困难低头，让路！失败了，再接再厉，斗争、失败，再斗争、再失败……直到胜利。不获全胜，决不收兵。
