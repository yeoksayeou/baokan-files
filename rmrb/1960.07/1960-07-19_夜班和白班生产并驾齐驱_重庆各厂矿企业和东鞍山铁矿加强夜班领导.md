Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 18th: Following the deep involvement of leading cadres from factories and mines in Chongqing at the forefront of production, they have focused on the weak link of night shift production, which is often lower than day shift production. By consistently participating in night shift labor, they have earnestly resolved problems in night shift production, enabling night shift production to quickly catch up with and surpass day shifts, significantly increasing production levels.

Many factories and mines, while consistently participating in night shift labor, have assigned cadres from various functional departments as a complete team to promptly address production issues. In the past, only a few leading cadres at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Second Open Hearth Furnace Plant participated in night shift labor, and some issues could not be resolved in a timely manner. Since June, they have improved the night shift labor system, with a factory-level leading cadre taking the lead every night. This group, including cadres from functional departments such as equipment maintenance and material supply, as well as engineers and technicians, formed a night shift duty team. They were divided into teams based on their expertise, contracted to specific areas, and supervised production on-site. Before the night shift took over, everyone would separately understand and study the production problems of the shift and then go and address them. A site balancing meeting was held midway through the shift to check the execution of each work section and resolve any temporary problems that arose. After the shift, a summary and evaluation meeting was held. In this way, everyone was responsible for everything, and the work was carried out solidly and meticulously, allowing the night shift to maintain the same production level as the day shift.

Many leading cadres, while insisting on night shift labor, also used the method of cultivating "experimental plots" to solve long-standing key production issues, not only realizing night shifts surpassing day shifts, but also promoting a leap forward for all three shifts. Since the beginning of this year, an important production issue faced by the Nan'an Iron Smelting Plant has been the low quality of raw materials and fuel, which has brought a series of problems to blast furnace production, especially the frequent occurrence of blast furnace hanging during the night shift, generally resulting in a yield that was 10% lower than the day shift. The plant's general branch secretary and director have recently been taking turns leading a group of cadres to participate in the late-night shift production at the blast furnace, focusing on the key issues of raw material and fuel quality and cultivating "experimental plots." After careful study, they found that the main reason was the lack of inspection of raw materials and fuel and the failure to adhere to the clean furnace entry system. The furnace operation was also not being flexibly controlled based on the furnace's situation. Therefore, a system of rotating shift foremen and an eight-person (taphole, slag outlet, hot blast stove, cost accounting, safety, tools, daily life, sanitation) post responsibility system was established, and active contact with the material yard was strengthened to carefully select raw materials and fuels, grading them for entry into the furnace. This basically avoided the problem of blast furnace hanging and allowed the night shift yield to exceed the day shift yield by 20%. By summarizing and promoting the experience of the night shift, other shifts were also able to quickly resolve the hanging problem, enabling a leap forward in production for all three shifts.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 18th: Leading cadres, technicians, and management personnel from Anshan Iron and Steel's Dong Anshan Iron Mine are taking turns participating in production and leading production at night, determined to make the mine's production "turn night into day."

Since the mine strengthened its leadership of night shift production in mid-June, night shift production has become as lively as day shift production, and production levels have increased substantially. According to statistics from the most recent half-month period, the average night shift output of the main product, concentrate powder, has increased by 30%, already catching up with and greatly exceeding the production level of the day shift.

Dong Anshan Mine operates continuously in three shifts, day and night. The night shift has many unfavorable factors and difficulties. However, the leading cadres of the mine, workshops, and work sections, as well as the cadres of the offices, all work during the day, and only the on-duty foreman leads production at night. Production management, labor competition organization, and propaganda and mobilization work were also often unable to keep pace with the day shift because there were no leading cadres to specifically manage them, making the night shift a weak link in the three-shift production.

Since strengthening the leadership of the night shift, every night at 11:30 PM, when the night shift workers come to work, there are leading cadres assigning tasks, explaining measures to complete the tasks, organizing workers to carry out competitions, and conducting propaganda and mobilization work. During night production, wherever problems or difficulties arise, leading cadres appear to mobilize workers to find solutions; wherever new operating experiences emerge, cadres promptly summarize and promote them; wherever new achievements appear in production, there is the sound of gongs and drums congratulating and reporting good news, making night shift production as lively as the day shift. In the past, the biggest headache for night shift workers was that once equipment failures occurred, they could not find relevant personnel to help handle them, so the equipment utilization rate of the night shift was the lowest. Due to the establishment of a night shift duty system for technical personnel and management personnel in each office and the increase in maintenance manpower, the equipment utilization rate of each workshop has increased significantly in the most recent half-month period. The ball mill utilization rate in the flotation workshop has increased from 73.43% to 80%.

### 夜班和白班生产并驾齐驱　重庆各厂矿企业和东鞍山铁矿加强夜班领导

　　夜班和白班生产并驾齐驱
　　重庆各厂矿企业和东鞍山铁矿加强夜班领导
    据新华社重庆18日电　重庆市厂矿企业许多领导干部深入生产第一线后，针对夜班生产往往低于白班生产的薄弱环节，坚持夜班跟班劳动，扎扎实实地解决夜班生产中的问题，使夜班生产很快赶上和超过了白班，大大提高了生产水平。
    不少厂矿在坚持深入夜班跟班劳动时，把各种职能部门的干部配成一套，以便及时解决生产问题。重庆钢铁公司第二平炉厂过去只是少数领导干部实行夜班跟班劳动，碰到有些问题，仍不能及时解决。从6月份开始他们改进了夜班跟班劳动制度，每天晚上由一个厂级领导干部挂帅，包括设备维护检修、材料供应等职能部门的干部与工程技术人员，组成夜班值班小组，按业务分片包干，跟班指挥生产。夜班接班前，大家分头了解和研究当班生产中的问题，然后分头去抓；中途开一次现场平衡会议，检查各工段执行情况，同时解决临时发生的问题，班后即召开总结评比会，总结评比。这样，事事有人负责，工作抓得踏实细致，使夜班保持了与白班相同的生产水平。
    许多领导干部在坚持夜班跟班劳动中，还用种“试验田”的方法解决长期存在的生产关键，不但实现了夜班超白班，还推动了三班齐跃进。南岸炼铁厂今年以来生产上碰到的重要问题，是原材料和燃料的质量低，给高炉生产带来了一系列的问题，特别是夜班经常发生高炉悬料等问题，产量一般低于白班10％。这个厂的总支书记、厂长最近轮流率领一批干部到高炉边参加深夜班生产，针对原材料、燃料的质量关键，大种“试验田”。经过仔细研究，发现主要原因是对原材料和燃料缺乏检查，没有坚持执行清洁入炉制度，炉前操作也没有根据炉子情况灵活掌握。于是，建立了工长轮流值班制和八大员（铁口，渣口，热风炉，成本核算，安全，工具，生活，清洁卫生）岗位责任制，并主动与料场加强联系，对原料、燃料进行认真精选，分级入炉。这样，便基本上避免了高炉悬料问题，使夜班产量超过白班产量20％。通过总结和推广夜班的经验，还使其他班也迅速解决了悬料问题，使三班生产一齐跃进。
    新华社鞍山18日电　鞍钢东鞍山铁矿领导干部、技术人员和管理人员，轮流在夜里参加生产领导生产，决心使全矿的生产“变黑夜为白天”。
    这个矿从6月中旬加强夜班生产领导工作之后，夜班的生产也像白班一样搞得热火朝天，生产水平大幅度上升。据最近半个月的统计，主要产品精矿粉的夜班产量平均增长30％，已经赶上并大大超过白班的生产水平。
    东鞍山矿昼夜三班连续生产。夜班有许多不利因素和困难。而矿、车间、工段的领导干部和科室干部却都是白天上班，夜里只有当班的工长领导生产；生产管理工作、劳动竞赛的组织工作和宣传鼓动工作，也都因为没有领导干部具体抓，生产常常不能和白班并驾齐驱，成为三班生产的薄弱环节。
    这个矿从加强对夜班的领导以来，每天夜里十一点半，夜班工人来上班时，都有领导干部布置任务交代完成任务的措施，组织工人开展竞赛，并进行宣传鼓动工作。在夜间生产中，哪里出现问题或困难，哪里就出现领导干部，发动工人想办法解决；哪里出现操作新经验，哪里就有干部及时的总结推广；哪里生产出现新成绩，哪里就有祝贺报喜的锣鼓声，使夜班生产变得像白班一样轰轰烈烈。过去夜班工人最头痛的，是一旦发生了设备故障，找不到有关人员帮助处理，所以夜班的设备作业率最低。由于各科室的技术人员和管理人员建立了夜间值班制度，并增加了检修人力，因此，最近半个月各车间的设备作业率，都有显著提高。浮选车间的球磨机作业率，已经从73.43％提到80％。
