People's Communes in Anhui Province
Focus on Summer Hygiene with Canteens as the Center

    (Reported by this newspaper) People's communes throughout Anhui Province are universally carrying out summer patriotic health campaigns with canteens as the center, striving to improve the sanitary standards of canteens in every possible way and actively preventing summer infectious diseases.

    Anhui Province regards doing a good job in canteen hygiene as one of the standards for running canteens well. Since the beginning of summer, in light of the characteristics of the large-scale breeding of mosquitoes and flies in summer and the easy occurrence and spread of intestinal infectious diseases, various places have launched patriotic health campaigns centered on canteens. During the campaign, various places demanded that canteen hygiene be rapidly achieved: no mosquitoes, no flies, no rats, no dust, no standing water, no filth, clean drinking water, clean food and dishes, clean cooking utensils and tableware, no eating of raw, cold, or spoiled food, and the establishment of strict sanitary systems. In order to further strengthen the leadership of canteen hygiene work and improve hygiene standards, various places have universally transferred cadres and health personnel to go deep into the canteens to work alongside the cooks; actively trained cooks to improve their sanitary knowledge; and also added sanitary equipment, etc. In Guangde County, as many as twenty-eight cadres from the county level alone were sent to the canteens. Taihe County has one health worker assigned to each canteen. Various places have universally mobilized the masses to carry out large-scale sanitary basic construction, large-scale cleaning, and large-scale scrubbing of the canteens, clearing garbage, and improving environmental sanitation. Many public canteens in Shou County have established separated stoves or "leaping forward" stoves, achieving both hygiene and saving fuel and labor, and have also universally installed screens on windows and doors and gauze covers, achieving fly-proof, dust-proof, cleanliness, and hygiene. In terms of drinking water, all village wells have been fitted with earthen water suction machines, realizing self-flowing drinking water. Lujiang County recently held a "Leap Forward" conference on eliminating pests and diseases in fifteen communes, with tens of thousands of people participating at various points. After the meeting, all parts of the county closely combined with production, with canteens as the center, to eliminate the four pests and pay great attention to hygiene. Various counties also trained canteen cooks.

    Since the launch of the summer patriotic health campaign centered on canteens, the sanitary standards of canteens in various places have been rapidly improved. In Xiuning County, more than 550 canteens across the county have achieved the standard of cleaning the dining room and kitchen three times a day; no garbage, no dust, no sewage around the canteen; and regular disinfection of bowls and chopsticks, accounting for 68% of the total number of canteens in the county. Canteens in Lujiang County have universally established epidemic registration books and infectious disease isolation rooms, and patients are promptly isolated and treated upon discovery.

    With the improvement of canteen hygiene standards, summer infectious diseases have been significantly reduced. At present, the summer patriotic health campaign centered on canteens, closely combined with heatstroke prevention, cooling measures, and field labor protection work, is being widely and deeply carried out in various places.

    安徽各地人民公社
    以食堂为中心大抓夏季卫生
    本报讯　安徽省各地人民公社普遍以食堂为中心开展夏季爱国卫生运动，千方百计地提高食堂卫生水平，积极预防夏季传染病。
    安徽省把搞好食堂卫生列为办好食堂的标准之一。入夏以来，各地根据夏季蚊蝇大量繁殖和肠道传染病容易发生流传的特点，开展以食堂为中心的爱国卫生运动。在运动中，各地要求迅速把食堂卫生做到：无蚊、无蝇、无鼠、无灰尘、无积水、无污物，饮水净，饭菜净，炊具、食具净，不吃生冷和变味变质的食物，建立严格的卫生制度。为了进一步加强食堂卫生工作的领导，提高卫生水平，各地普遍抽调干部和卫生人员，深入食堂，跟班劳动；积极培训炊事员，提高炊事员的卫生知识水平；还增添了卫生设备等。广德县派到食堂的干部，仅县一级的就有二十八人之多。太和县每个食堂都配有一位卫生人员。各地普遍发动群众对食堂进行大搞卫生基本建设，大扫除，大洗刷，清除垃圾，改进环境卫生。首县的许多公共食堂都建立了隔墙灶或跃进灶，做到既卫生又节约燃料和劳动力，而且还普遍设置了纱窗纱门和纱罩，做到防蝇、防尘，清洁卫生。在饮用水方面，各村水井都按上土吸水机，实现了饮用水自流化。庐江县最近在十五个公社，分点召开了有几十万人参加的除害灭病跃进大会。会后，全县各地都密切结合生产，以食堂为中心，大除四害，大讲卫生。各县还对食堂炊事员进行训练。
    以食堂为中心的夏季爱国卫生运动开展以来，各地食堂卫生水平迅速提高。休宁全县已有五百五十多个食堂做到饭厅厨房每天打扫三次；食堂周围无垃圾、无灰尘、无污水、碗筷定期消毒，这样的食堂，占全县食堂总数的68％。庐江县食堂普遍建立了疫情登记簿和传染病隔离室，发现病人即及时隔离和治疗。
    随着食堂卫生水平的提高，夏季传染病显著减少。现在，以食堂为中心的夏季爱国卫生运动，紧密结合防暑降温和田间劳动保护工作，正在各地广泛深入地开展。（附图片）
