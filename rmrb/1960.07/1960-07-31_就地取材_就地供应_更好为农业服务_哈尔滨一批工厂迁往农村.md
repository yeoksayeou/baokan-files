Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 30th: Thirty-four local state-owned factories in Harbin have already moved from the city to the countryside. These factories are in industries such as machinery, chemicals, clothing, pharmaceuticals, fur, and building materials. After moving from Harbin to Hulan, Shuangcheng, Wuchang, Acheng, Zhaodong, Bin County and other places, these factories have become the backbone of county and commune industry, not only strongly supporting agricultural technological transformation, but also developing their own production.

Adopting the method of relocating factories, and moving local industrial enterprises whose raw materials come from the countryside, or whose products are mainly sold in the countryside, to the countryside in a planned and phased manner, is an important measure taken by the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to accelerate the development of county and commune industry and promote agricultural technological transformation.

After these factories moved to the countryside, under the education of the Party, the broad masses of workers firmly established the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and the viewpoint of serving agricultural technological transformation wholeheartedly. As soon as many factories arrived in the countryside, the Party committee secretaries, factory directors and other leading cadres immediately led workers and technicians to visit the countryside to understand the needs of the countryside, and adopted the method of linking factories and communes, and taking responsibility to the end, to support agricultural technological transformation. After the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory moved to Wuchang County, it immediately sent seventeen technicians to the county's water conservancy construction site to help repair water conservancy construction machinery, and repaired thirteen tractors, bulldozers and automobiles within a few days.

There are many benefits to moving factories to the countryside. First, it promotes and drives the development of county and commune industry, enabling the county's machinery industry to develop from only being able to repair and manufacture general agricultural implements in the past, to being able to produce products such as lathes, diesel engines, gas engines, seeders, harvesters, and electric motors, which strongly promotes agricultural technological transformation. After the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory moved from Harbin to Wuchang County, it has produced more than 2,800 seeders, harvesters, weeders, generators, electric plows and other equipment for the rural people's communes, and repaired more than 1,200 tractors, diesel engines and various agricultural implements for the people's communes. Together with the two small agricultural machinery factories originally in Wuchang County, they produced a large number of paddy field seeders, enabling the county's paddy fields to use mechanical seeding.

Second, the factories are closer to the raw material producing areas, making it easier to use local materials, rationally utilize local resources, increase production, expand varieties, and better serve the diverse needs of agricultural production. For example, the Hulan Pharmaceutical Factory, which moved from Harbin to the countryside at the end of last year, has established a raw material base in the Mengjia People's Commune in Hulan County, and has trial-produced more than ten new products using the various wild plants that are abundant locally, supplying both urban and rural people.

Third, after urban factories go to the countryside, because they can obtain materials locally, produce locally, and supply locally, transportation links are reduced, alleviating the burden on the transportation sector.

Fourth, the industrial layout gradually becomes more reasonable.

### 就地取材  就地供应  更好为农业服务  哈尔滨一批工厂迁往农村

    就地取材  就地供应  更好为农业服务
    哈尔滨一批工厂迁往农村
    据新华社哈尔滨30日电　哈尔滨市已经有三十四座地方国营工厂从城市迁往农村。在这些工厂中，有机械、化工、被服、制药、毛皮、建筑材料等行业。这些工厂从哈尔滨迁到呼兰、双城、五常、阿城、肇东、宾县等地以后，成了县、社工业的骨干力量，不仅有力地支援了农业技术改造，而且使自己的生产有了发展。
    采取迁厂的办法，把一些原料来自农村，或产品主要销售于农村的地方工业企业，有计划地分期、分批迁往农村，这是中共哈尔滨市委为了加速发展县、社工业，促进农业技术改造而采取的一项重要措施。
    这些工厂在迁到农村以后，广大职工在党的教育下，牢固地树立起农业是国民经济的基础的思想，和全心全意为农业技术改造服务的观点。许多工厂一到农村，工厂的党委书记、厂长等领导干部立即率领工人和技术人员到农村去访问，了解农村需要，并且采取厂社挂钩、一包到底的办法，支援农业技术改造。松花江农业机械厂迁到五常县以后，立即派出十七名技术工人到这个县的水利工地去帮助检修水利施工机械，在几天内就修好了十三台拖拉机、推土机和汽车。
    把工厂迁到农村有许多好处。第一，促进和带动了县、社工业的发展，使各县机械工业在过去只能修理和制造一般农具的基础上，发展到能生产车床、柴油机、煤气机、播种机、收割机、电动机等产品，有力地促进了农业技术改造。松花江农业机械厂从哈尔滨市迁到五常县以后，已经为农村人民公社生产了播种机、收割机、除草机、发电机、电犁等二千八百多台，并为各人民公社修理了拖拉机、柴油机和各种农业机具一千二百多台。他们和五常县原有的两家小型农业机械厂一起，生产了大批水田播种机，使全县水田采用了机械播种。
    第二，使工厂接近了原料产地，便于就地取材，合理利用当地的资源，增加生产，扩大品种，更好地为农业生产多方面的需要服务。如去年年底从哈尔滨市迁到农村的呼兰制药厂，已经在呼兰县孟家人民公社建立了原料基地，利用当地盛产的各种野生植物试制了十多种新产品，供应了城乡人民。
    第三，城市工厂下乡后，由于做到了就地取材，就地生产，就地供应，因而减少了运输环节，减轻了交通运输部门的负担。
    第四，使工业布局逐渐趋向合理。
