Shanghai, July 19th (By Our Own Correspondent) - The Party organization of the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant has insisted on working at the furnace front for the past two years, doing meticulous and thorough ideological work at the furnace front, and cadres and masses have become one. They have always maintained vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit and finally won the national red flag for small open-hearth steelmaking. Since February this year, the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace in this workshop has consistently been leading the country. The steel output in the first half of the year increased by 24% compared with the same period last year, and the variety of steel has increased by one and a half times. In terms of quality, the first-class product rate reached more than 97.9%, and the proportion of high-quality steel and alloy steel has increased significantly.

Only by Admitting Backwardness Can We Catch Up with the Advanced

Since 1958, the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant has been lagging behind the open hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant. In order to learn from Plant No. 3 and catch up with Plant No. 3, the Party general branch of this workshop, together with the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League organization, moved the office to the furnace front in July 1958, and the leading cadres ate at the furnace front, slept at the furnace front, and worked and discussed with the workers. Although significant achievements have been made in production, it is still lagging behind Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant.

Why can't we surpass Plant No. 3 for a long time? This sparked a debate at the beginning of this year. During the debate, some cadres expressed dissatisfaction with the open hearth furnace of Plant No. 3, but the workers criticized these cadres for being unmodest and not admitting their backwardness. They said that in the past, when cadres went to Plant No. 3 to learn advanced experience, they just took a cursory look, failed to see the advantages, and brought back a lot of shortcomings. After the debate, the Party general branch held consecutive meetings to examine the conservative thinking of cadres who were not modest in learning from the advanced and did not try every means to strive for the advanced. Then, they conducted a theoretical discussion with the masses, expressing their determination to learn from the advanced and win the red flag. The workers also had great confidence. They said, "Plant No. 3 uses molten steel to solidify the red flag, and we will use an electric cutter to snatch it back." The workshop immediately organized a "learning" team, led by the general branch secretary, to seriously learn from the open hearth furnace workshop of Plant No. 3, and discovered many advanced experiences of Plant No. 3. For example, after learning the experience of Plant No. 3 in loading more, the loading capacity immediately rose to more than 100 tons, with a maximum of 132 tons, and the output increased sharply. In February, this workshop fully surpassed the open hearth furnace of Plant No. 3 and won the national red flag for small open-hearth steelmaking.

After Victory, Work Should Be More Meticulous and Pragmatic

After winning the red flag, the workers said that although we have won the red flag, it is just "picking the tallest among the dwarfs, not selecting generals from among generals." They compared the various economic and technical indicators of the workshop with the most advanced levels in the country, and found five "backward hats" such as the utilization coefficient, operating rate, and iron consumption of the workshop. The Party general branch immediately mobilized the masses to launch a competition to remove the "backward hats." Because the general branch modestly listened to the opinions of the masses, was able to see its shortcomings when it was advanced, and prevented complacency in time, the production in April created newer achievements.

The leading cadres of this workshop deeply realized that only by humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, analyzing them, and studying methods with the masses can we better mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. They worked at the furnace front, letting themselves take root among the masses, and heard the discussions and reactions of the masses at any time. In the past, the office was far away from the workshop, and the workers called the office a "writing room," and it was usually difficult to find time to go to the office. Now the office is at the furnace front. Although the house is small and dusty, the workers love it very much and call it the "command headquarters." It is very convenient to find the leaders if something happens. In the general branch office, workers come and go all day long, and the relationship between the workers and the general branch is very close.

Don't Be Afraid of Trouble in Work, But Also Take the Initiative to Find "Trouble"

When dealing with and deciding on any issue, the leaders of this workshop do not adopt simple and convenient methods, but take the initiative to find trouble and rely on the masses from the bottom up to discuss and solve it. In April, the workshop proposed to promote five new steelmaking technologies, such as blowing compressed air, which was a major measure to rapidly increase steel production. However, at that time, the main leading cadres of the workshop had different opinions, and some believed that it would damage the furnace if it was used. The Party general branch decided to stop the meeting and discuss the controversial issues with the masses, and draw conclusions with the masses. At that time, the opinions of the masses were also not unified. What should be done? The general branch decided to adopt the suggestions put forward by the workers, fully promote technical democracy, and organize a competition between two furnaces. All employees who were willing to try new technologies went to Furnace No. 1, and those who did not advocate using it went to Furnace No. 2, and the leaders went to the furnace front to take charge. As a result, the furnace using the new technology succeeded. A dispute was resolved satisfactorily.

When there are shortcomings in the leadership's work, honestly make self-criticism to the masses, so the masses trust their leaders more. Once, when the furnace was in the later stage, the furnace bottom should have been sintered. The leaders wanted to produce a few more furnaces of steel and delayed it for a few days. The workers raised their opinions, but the leaders did not pay attention to it. As a result, a steel leakage accident occurred, forcing an early overhaul. After the accident, the general branch secretary and the workshop director seriously made sincere self-criticism to the workers of the three shifts three times, criticizing themselves for not being humble in considering the opinions of the masses. After the leaders made self-criticism, many workers also took the initiative to examine themselves, and some workers also made guarantees, expressing that they would further strengthen their sense of production responsibility and more frequently reflect the usage of the furnace to the leaders.

Educate Employees with Facts and Strengthen Collaboration

There are many links in steelmaking production, and mutual cooperation is very important. If one link is disconnected, it will affect the overall situation. The workshop leaders analyzed the production situation in April and found that due to the lack of the spirit of cooperation between shifts, steel production always declined during shift handover. The general branch did not immediately criticize the masses, but seriously did a month's worth of statistical work, telling the masses all the statistical results and the losses caused by poor handover, so that everyone could carefully calculate the accounts and reason. When the workers saw that nearly 1,000 tons of steel were lost in a month just because the cooperative relationship was not good, everyone was very distressed and consciously criticized the idea of ​​departmentalism, actively strengthened the cooperative relationship between all links, and further promoted the style of leaving difficulties to themselves and making things convenient for others.

Because every task insists on putting politics in command, the leaders resolutely rely on the masses and believe in the masses, the workers in this workshop have a high degree of production enthusiasm and consciousness, and a strong sense of responsibility as masters. The leaders and the masses are of one mind, and the entire workshop produces in a tense and rhythmic manner without being chaotic. The workshop is both a production organization and a fighting collective. Everyone is thinking about how to produce more steel and make good steel. Now, as soon as the bell for releasing steel rings, many people from the boiler room, crane team, coal loading and feeding positions actively rush to the furnace front to help add materials. Although the number of operators per furnace has been reduced by eleven compared to the past, the feeding time, which is an important key to determining steel production, has been greatly shortened compared to the past. In the battle to fight high temperatures and seize high yields, steel production quality has continued to rise, and new records have continued to appear. Since June, the daily output has continuously exceeded 700 tons. On the 11th, the daily output reached 745 tons, and the first-class product rate reached 100%, creating the highest record in the history of the workshop. (Attached picture)

　　领导干部两年来守炉餐伴炉眠坚持炉前办公
　　上钢一厂平炉车间夺得全国红旗
    本报上海19日电　上海第一钢铁厂平炉车间党组织，两年来坚持炉前办公，踏踏实实、深入细致地把思想工作做到炉前去，干部和群众打成一片，始终保持着旺盛的革命斗志，终于夺得了全国小型平炉炼钢红旗。今年2月份起，这个车间的平炉利用系数连续在全国领先；上半年钢产量比去年同期增加24％，钢的品种增加了一倍半；质量方面，一级品率达到97.9％以上，优质钢、合金钢的比重有了很大增长。
　　只有承认落后才能赶上先进
    上钢一厂平炉车间从1958年以后，一直落在上钢三厂平炉的后面。为了学三厂、赶三厂，这个车间的党总支，从1958年7月起，和行政、工会、团组织一起，将办公室搬到炉前办公，领导干部吃在炉前、睡在炉前，和工人共同劳动、共同商量。生产上虽然也取得了显著的成绩，可是，仍然落在上钢三厂的后面。
    为什么长期不能超过三厂？今年年初，曾引起了一场争论。争论中有的干部对三厂平炉表示不服气，工人却批评这些干部不虚心，不承认自己落后。他们说，干部过去到三厂学习先进经验，只是粗枝大叶逛一趟，优点看不到，缺点带回来一大堆。经过辩论，接着党总支连续召开会议，检查了干部不虚心学习先进，不千方百计争取先进的保守思想。然后和群众一道务虚讨论，表示下决心学先进、夺红旗。工人们信心也很足。说：“三厂用钢水把红旗浇牢，我们要用电割刀把它夺过来”。车间立即组织了“取经”团，由总支书记挂帅到三厂平炉车间认真学习，发现了三厂许多先进经验。如学习了三厂平炉多装的经验以后，装入量立即上升到一百吨以上，最高达到了一百三十二吨，产量猛增一倍。2月份，这个车间全面超过了三厂平炉，夺得了全国小型平炉炼钢红旗。
　　胜利了工作要更细致更踏实
    夺得红旗以后，工人说，我们虽然夺得了红旗，不过是“矮子中挑长子，不是将军里挑选将军”。他们把车间各项经济、技术指标和全国最先进水平比较，查出了车间利用系数、作业率、铁耗等五项“落后帽子”，党总支立即发动群众开展一个摘“落后帽子”的竞赛。由于总支虚心听取群众意见，在先进的时候，能够看到自己的不足之处，及时防止了骄傲自满，因此，4月份生产创造了更新的成就。
    这个车间的领导干部深深体会到，只有虚心倾听群众的意见，加以分析，并和群众一道研究办法，这样才能更好地发挥群众的积极性。他们到炉前办公，让自己生根于群众之中，随时听到群众的议论，群众的反映。过去办公室远离车间，工人叫办公室是“写字间”，平常很难得有时间到办公室去；现在办公室就在炉前，出了门就是炉子，虽然房子小，灰尘大，工人却很喜爱它，都称它“指挥部”。有什么事，找领导非常方便。总支办公室里，一天到晚，工人进进出出，川流不息，工人和总支关系十分亲密。
　　工作不怕麻烦，还要主动找“麻烦”
    这个车间领导在处理和决定任何问题时，不是采取简单省事的办法，而是主动找麻烦，自下而上地依靠群众去议论，去解决。4月份，车间提出推广吹压缩空气等五项炼钢新技术，这是迅速提高钢产量的重大措施。但当时车间主要领导干部意见不统一，有的认为使用了会损坏炉子。党总支决定把会议停下来，带着争论的问题，去和群众商量，和群众一道做结论。当时群众的意见也不统一，怎么办？总支决定采纳工人提出的建议，充分发扬技术民主，凡是愿意试用新技术的职工到一号炉上去，不主张使用的到二号炉上，组织两只炉子竞赛，领导到炉前去挂帅。结果，使用新技术的炉子成功了。一场争论得到了圆满解决。
    领导工作中有缺点时，老老实实向群众公开做检查，因此，群众便更加信赖自己的领导。有一次，炉子已经到了后期，应该烧结炉底，领导想多出几炉钢，拖延了几天，工人提出了意见，领导也未引起注意，结果发生了漏钢事故，被迫提前中修。事故发生后，总支书记、车间主任很严肃地分三次向三班工人诚恳地做了检查，批评自己考虑群众意见不虚心。领导检查以后，很多工人也主动检查了自己，有的工人还提出了保证，表示进一步加强生产责任感，更经常地向领导反映炉子使用情况。
　　用事实教育职工加强协作
    炼钢生产环节多，相互协作十分重要，一环脱节，影响全局。车间领导分析了4月份生产情况，发现因缺乏班与班之间的协作精神，交接班时钢产量总是要下降。总支并没有立即去批评群众，而是认认真真做了一个月的统计工作，把统计结果和因交接班不好而造成的损失，全部告诉群众，让大家来算细账、讲道理。工人看到仅仅因协作关系未搞好，一个月损失近千吨钢时，人人很心痛，都自觉地批判了本位主义思想，主动加强了各个环节的协作关系，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的风格更加发扬。
    由于项项工作坚持政治挂帅，领导坚决依靠群众，相信群众，因此，这个车间工人生产积极性、自觉性很高，主人翁的责任感很强烈。领导和群众一条心，整个车间生产紧张而有节奏、不忙乱，车间既是生产组织又是战斗的集体，人人想着如何多出钢、炼好钢。现在，只要放钢钟声一响，马上有许多人从锅炉房、行车组、上煤上料等岗位上，主动赶到炉前帮助加料。每只炉子操作工人虽比过去减少了十一人，但决定钢产量重要关键的进料时间，却比过去大大缩短。在战高温、夺高产的战斗中，钢产量质量不断上升，新纪录连续出现。6月以来，日产量连续突破七百吨。11日，日产量达到了七百四十五吨，一级品率达到100％，创造了车间历史上最高纪录。（附图片）
