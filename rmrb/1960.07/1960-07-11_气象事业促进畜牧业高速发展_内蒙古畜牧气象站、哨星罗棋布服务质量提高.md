　　Meteorological Work Promotes Rapid Development of Animal Husbandry
　　Animal Husbandry Meteorological Stations and Observation Posts Dotted Across Inner Mongolia, Service Quality Improved

　  (Our Correspondent Eerdemutu reports) The great leap forward in animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia and the realization of people's communes in pastoral areas have opened up infinitely broad avenues for the development of animal husbandry meteorological work. At present, every league (盟) has a meteorological station, every banner and county has a central station, achieving the network of meteorological stations, posts, and groups two and a half years ahead of schedule. Now, the meteorological stations and observation posts serving animal husbandry throughout the region are as numerous as stars in the sky, and the mass non-detached meteorological force accounts for about 4% of the pastoral population.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, Inner Mongolia's meteorological science has, over the past few years, used weather forecasts (especially for disastrous weather) and pastoral meteorological forecasts as important means, adopted the "three grasps and one battle" approach, that is, grasping production, grasping the season, and grasping key points, and launched large-scale meteorological service campaigns to provide extensive meteorological services for animal husbandry production, playing a role as it should in ensuring the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. For example, before liberation, the livestock mortality rate in the region due to weather disasters was as high as about 11%. By the 1958 pastoral year (starting July 1st), the livestock mortality rate caused by disastrous weather had dropped to 2%-4%. Due to the full utilization of the role of the animal husbandry meteorological service network and the implementation of the principle of combining large, medium, and small-scale weather forecasts, with medium and small-scale forecasts as the main focus, preliminary statistics show that in the 1959 pastoral year, the region was hit by seven strong cold waves and blizzards, but the number of livestock lost due to weather disasters decreased by 55% compared to the previous year. The meteorological station of Xiwuzhumuqin Banner in Xilingol League has excellently created a set of long-term weather forecasting methods in the course of its service, accurately predicting various disastrous weather conditions. This spring, the Han’aol People's Commune of this banner, based on the long-term forecast of the banner station, moved its winter camps, avoiding a major snow disaster and ensuring the safe overwintering and spring survival of tens of thousands of livestock.

    In the process of carrying out mass weather forecasting for disaster prevention and livestock protection production, meteorological organizations at all levels in Inner Mongolia mobilized a large number of cadres to go deep into pastoral areas, eating, living, and working with the herdsmen, summarizing the experiences of the herdsmen, and compiling nearly ten professional animal husbandry meteorological forecasting materials for livestock fattening, mating, pregnancy protection, lamb protection, wool and cashmere shearing, pasture harvesting, and diseases, enabling meteorological work to enter a new stage of comprehensive service for animal husbandry. All parts of the region have also widely carried out supplementary forecasting work. According to statistics at the end of 1959, about 60% of the meteorological observation posts had carried out supplementary forecasting. Due to the comprehensive implementation of the "eight-character" measures for supplementary forecasting, namely, listen (to broadcasts), look (at the sky), sayings (proverbs), land (topography and geography), materials (historical data), consultation (weather consultation), use (arranging production according to forecasts), and management (strengthening supplementary forecast management), the forecasting accuracy rate reached 86.6%, an increase of 3.4% compared to 1958.

    Before the Great Leap Forward, the problem of weather forecast transmission in Inner Mongolia had not been completely resolved. However, after the realization of meteorization in 1958, with the widespread establishment of the service network, the problem of forecast transmission was not only solved in a short period of four months, but also the forecasts were timely, specific, accurate, and closely integrated with production needs, greatly improving the quality of service.

### 气象事业促进畜牧业高速发展　内蒙古畜牧气象站、哨星罗棋布服务质量提高

　　气象事业促进畜牧业高速发展
　　内蒙古畜牧气象站、哨星罗棋布服务质量提高
　  本报讯　记者额尔德木图报道：内蒙古畜牧业生产的大跃进和牧区人民公社化的实现，为畜牧气象工作的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。目前，全区盟盟有台，旗县有中心站，已提前两年半实现了气象台、站、哨、组网的建设。现在，全区为畜牧业服务的气象站、哨星罗棋布，群众性的不脱产气象大军约占牧区人口的4％。
    内蒙古的气象科学事业在党的正确领导下，几年来，以天气预报
  （特别是灾害性天气）和牧业气象预报为重要手段，采取三抓一战，即抓生产、抓季节、抓关键，大搞气象服务战役的方法，对畜牧业生产进行广泛的气象服务工作，在高速度发展畜牧业生产中发挥了气象工作应有的保证作用。如解放前，全区由于天气灾害造成的牲畜死亡率高达11％左右。到1958年牧业年度（以7月1日为年界）牲畜因灾害性天气造成的死亡率降低到2％—4％。由于充分发挥了畜牧气象服务网的作用，贯彻了天气预报大中小结合，以中小为主的方针，据初步统计，1959年的牧业年度内，全区受过七次强寒潮和大风雪等灾害的侵袭，但因天气灾害而损失的牲畜，却比上一年度减少了55％。锡林郭勒盟的西乌珠穆沁旗的气象台，在服务过程中，很出色的创造了一套长期天气预报方法，准确地报出各种灾害性天气。这个旗的罕遨拉人民公社今年春天就根据旗台的长期预报，迁移了冬营地，躲过了大雪灾，保证了几万头牲畜安全地度过了冬春。
    内蒙古各级气象组织，在开展群众性的天气预报的防灾保畜生产过程中，动员大批干部深入牧区，和牧民同吃、同住、同劳动，总结牧民经验，编出牲畜抓膘、配种、保胎、保羔、剪毛抓绒、牧草收割以及病疫等近十项畜牧气象专业预报资料，使气象工作为畜牧业的服务进入了全面服务的新阶段。全区各地还广泛地开展了补充预报工作，据1959年底的统计，开展补充预报的气象哨已达60％左右。由于全面的贯彻了补充预报的听（收听）、看（看天象）、谚（谚语）、地（地形地理）、资（历史资料）、商（天气会商）、用（根据预报安排生产）、管（加强补充预报管理）等八字措施，所以预报准确率达到86.6％，1959年比1958年提高了3.4％。
    内蒙古在大跃进以前，气象预报传递问题未能彻底解决。而1958年实现气象化以后，随着服务网的普遍建立，在短短四个月时间，不仅解决了预报传递问题，而且使预报及时、具体、准确密切结合生产需要，大大提高了服务质量。
