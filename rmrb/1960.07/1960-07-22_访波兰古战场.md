Visiting the Ancient Battlefield of Poland
Wei Keming Ma Qianqing

On July 17th, Poland held a grand gathering of 200,000 people in the Grunwald area to commemorate the 550th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. The Chinese journalists delegation was honored to participate in this solemn celebration.

The commemoration of this battle today is not only because it was a famous battle in Polish history, but more importantly, commemorating this battle that defeated the eastward invasion of the Germans has important practical significance.

The Battle of Grunwald, which began on July 15, 1410, ultimately defeated the German "Teutonic Knights." This invading army of more than 60,000 people was the most stubborn combat force of the infamous Crusaders. Since the 11th century, the Crusaders had launched expeditions, and around the 13th century, after encountering strong resistance from the people in their invasion of Palestine, they turned to a large-scale offensive to the east, implementing a policy of "extermination" and "Germanization" against the Slavic and Lithuanian people. The brave Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, and Czech people united to fight back and finally eliminated the stubborn "Teutonic Knights." Their leader, Ulrich, was also killed. This was a victory for the patriotic war, it awakened the Polish people and strengthened their determination and confidence in defending the independence of their motherland. Therefore, the Polish people are holding such a grand meeting today to commemorate this significant festival.

The conference was held on a hill in this ancient battlefield. The so-called ancient battlefield is, of course, not like the "vast and boundless sandy plains" described by the ancient Chinese. It is a golden field, with waves of wheat rolling. In the early morning, crowds of people from all directions poured onto the hill amidst the sound of drums. The rostrum, built with steel bars, stood on the highest point of the hill. Opposite the rostrum, there was a cluster of very tall flagpoles, with the flags of the countries that participated in defeating the German invasion hanging on them, symbolizing the great unity of the Slavic nations. To the left of the rostrum was the orderly ranks of the Polish Defense Forces, and to the right and opposite were the masses of people from all regions and all walks of life, including 30,000 young people from all over Poland, who had camped here for two weeks before the celebration, engaging in labor and patriotic and internationalist ideological education. The expressions of the people were joyful and serious. They commemorated the heroic deeds of history with pride; at the same time, they treated the new war threats from the West with a serious attitude.

At 11:00 a.m., Chairman Zawadzki announced the official start of the conference, and thunderous applause resounded throughout the hill. Following speeches by Organov, the head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, and Juriš, the head of the Czechoslovak government delegation, Comrade Gomulka delivered an important report amidst warm applause. He explained the great significance of commemorating the 550th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, analyzed the current international situation, and put forward the current combat tasks of the Polish people. He said that the wolfish nature of German imperialists from Grunwald to the present-day Adenauer has not fundamentally changed. He said that we commemorate the Battle of Grunwald for peace, but West German militarists have inherited the worst traditions of Prussia, threatening world peace with the desire for revenge and aggression. Comrade Gomulka pointed out that the road of West German militarists to invade the East has been blocked. Blocking this road are the united and powerful Warsaw Pact member states with common ideas. He called on the Polish people, especially the Polish youth, to enhance their patriotic and internationalist ideology. He said that true patriotism and internationalism are inseparable. He asked the Polish youth to combine their personal goals, wishes, and views with the goals, wishes, and views of the working class, and to strive for actively improving labor productivity with selfless and heroic labor. The conference concluded amidst the rumbling of salutes and the solemn Internationale. A highly technical air force performance and artistic performance were also held after the meeting.

During our visits throughout Poland, we could see that the Polish people love peace. Like all socialist countries, they are engaged in socialist construction and need a peaceful and developing international environment even more. However, the Polish people have historical lessons that they can never forget. For hundreds of years, especially in recent decades, the Polish people have suffered the pain of being invaded. The Second World War began with the German fascists' invasion of Poland. The iron hooves of Hitler's army almost trampled all over Polish territory. Like the Japanese warlords implemented the "Three Alls Policy" in China, they did everything possible to destroy. More than 80% of Warsaw's factories, enterprises, and residential houses were severely damaged. As the Polish people said, the enemy "wanted to erase Warsaw from the map," so even today you can still see traces of the war. When we visited northeastern Poland, we saw the old site of Hitler's headquarters. This headquarters was located in a valley in an area called "Kętrzyn," with eight solid steel and concrete underground buildings. The local people told us that Hitler forced prisoners of war and local residents to build this bunker complex at that time. After it was completed, in order to keep it secret, more than 10,000 people who participated in the construction were executed alive. The designer of this bunker complex was an Italian engineer, who also died in a plane "accident" on his way back home. The Polish people still have vivid memories of these shocking events. Today, although Hitler is dead, Hitler elements still exist. They vainly attempt to organize a new crusade to the east, and they do not recognize Poland's sacred western border. Therefore, it is easy to understand that the Polish people maintain a high degree of vigilance against the resurgence of West German militarism.

Why are the likes of Adenauer so arrogant and domineering? In his speech at the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Lodz on January 19 this year, Comrade Gomulka answered this question, saying: "West German militarists and revanchists themselves cannot pose a threat to the cause of world peace. They are a threat because they have influential backers in the West, especially in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc. Poland's advanced working class and advanced people can deeply appreciate this truth." A driver named Jan Stasiak, who drove us to various places for visits, talked to us a lot about his views on imperialism along the way. He said: "The capitalists and imperialists of the world are all the same. West Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom all exploit and oppress workers and invade others." Many workers who talked to us have this kind of class viewpoint, and this driver comrade is just one example.

The Battle of Grunwald ended with the defeat of the invaders, and Hitler, who provoked World War II, also met the same fate. The strong bunker complex of Hitler's invasion headquarters has long been destroyed. The door of Hitler's office in those years has been submerged in weeds, which coincides with an ancient Chinese saying: "He was a hero for a generation, but where is he now?" When we visited the Olsztyn Provincial Museum, where Grunwald is located, we saw many trophies from the Battle of Grunwald, including many replicas of enemy flags captured at that time. Some of these flags had eagles painted on them, some had a bull's head, and some had monsters with chicken feet and human bodies... These strange-shaped flags were the symbols of the occupiers' arrogance at the time, but they have long been sent to the museum. The Polish people today commemorate this famous battle with full confidence in victory. They say that defeating the German invaders in those years relied on the unity of the Slavic nations and the joint struggle of the Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, and Czech people.

Today, relying on the unity and struggle of the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, we can definitely cut off the claws of West German militarists.

Although the commemoration of the Battle of Grunwald has passed, various practical activities have not ended. The Polish people are now welcoming the 16th anniversary of Poland's National Day with practical actions to complete production tasks and work tasks ahead of schedule. Many basic construction workers have proposed to hand over construction projects for use ahead of July 22; workers at the Poznan agricultural tool factory wrote a letter to Comrade Gomulka, guaranteeing to produce more and better agricultural machinery to support agricultural production. More than 6,000 factories across the country are participating in the socialist labor competition. On the eve of the 16th anniversary of Poland's National Day, the atmosphere everywhere is full of vitality.

At a banquet, Comrade Indrykhovsky, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and chairman of the Poland-China Friendship Association, had a cordial conversation with Comrade Wang Bingnan, the Chinese Ambassador to Poland, and comrades of the Chinese journalists delegation. He told us about the practical significance of commemorating the Battle of Grunwald and the determination and confidence of the Polish people to defeat any new crusade to the east. Comrade Wang Bingnan raised his glass and said: Cheers to opposing a new crusade to the east! The Polish people's struggle against imperialist war policies and aggression policies and for maintaining world peace is supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and actively supported by the Chinese people. The Chinese people regard every victory in the Polish people's struggle as their own victory. We sincerely wish the Polish people new and greater victories in the struggle against wars of aggression and for maintaining world peace.

    访波兰古战场
    魏克明  马谦卿
    7月17日，波兰在格隆瓦尔德地区举行了有二十万人参加的盛大集会，纪念格隆瓦尔德战役五百五十周年。中国新闻工作者代表团荣幸地参加了这个隆重的盛典。
    今天举行这个战役纪念，不仅因为它是波兰历史上的一次有名的战役，更重要的是，纪念这个打败日耳曼东侵的战役，有它重要的现实意义。
    从1410年7月15日开始的格隆瓦尔德战役，最后打败了日耳曼的“条顿骑士团”。这支六万多人的侵略军，曾是臭名昭著的十字军的最顽强的一支战斗队伍。十字军自十一世纪开始远征，约十三世纪，在向巴勒斯坦方面侵略遭受到人民坚强反抗以后，就转为大规模地向东方进攻，对斯拉夫、立陶宛人民实行“斩尽杀绝”和“日耳曼化”的侵略政策。英勇的波兰人、立陶宛人、俄罗斯人、捷克人联合起来进行反击，终于消灭了顽强的“条顿骑士团”，这个骑士团的头领乌尔里西也被打死了。这是一次爱国主义战争的胜利，它唤起了波兰人民的觉醒，增强了波兰人民捍卫祖国独立的决心和信心。所以今天波兰人民举行这样隆重的大会来纪念这个有重大意义的节日。
    大会在这个古战场的一个山岗上举行。所谓古战场，当然不是像中国古人所形容的那样：“浩浩乎平沙无垠”，这里是一片金黄的田野，麦浪翻腾。清晨，从四面八方赶来的人群，在金鼓声中涌上山岗。用钢筋搭成的主席台，矗立在山岗的最高处，主席台的对面，有一丛很高的旗杆，上面悬挂着参加这次打垮日耳曼侵略的各国的国旗，象征着斯拉夫民族的大团结。主席台的左面，是波兰国防军的整齐的行列，右边和对面，是来自各地、各阶层的人民群众。其中包括来自波兰各地的三万青年，他们在庆祝大会前两个星期即在此地露营，进行劳动和爱国主义、国际主义思想教育。人们的表情，是欢乐的，也是严肃的，他们以骄傲的心情来纪念历史上的英雄事迹；同时，也以严肃的心情对待来自西方的新的战争威胁。
    上午十一时，萨瓦茨基主席宣布大会正式开始，整个山岗上响起了雷鸣般的掌声。继苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长奥尔加诺夫和捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团长朱里什讲话后，哥穆尔卡同志在热烈的掌声中作了重要的报告，他说明纪念格隆瓦尔德战役五百五十周年的重大意义，分析了当前的国际形势，提出了当前波兰人民的战斗任务。他说，德国帝国主义者的豺狼本性从格隆瓦尔德到现在的阿登纳，没有根本的改变。他说，我们纪念格隆瓦尔德战役是为了和平，而西德军国主义者却继承了普鲁士的最坏的传统，以复仇的侵略的愿望，威胁世界和平。哥穆尔卡同志指出，西德军国主义者向东侵略的道路已被堵塞了，堵塞这条道路的是有共同思想的、团结一致的、强大的华沙条约的缔约国。他号召波兰人民，特别是波兰青年，提高爱国主义和国际主义的思想，他说，真正的爱国主义和国际主义是不可分割的。他要求波兰青年把个人的目的、愿望和观点与工人阶级的目的、愿望和观点结合起来，以忘我的、英勇的劳动为积极提高劳动生产率而斗争。大会在隆隆的礼炮和庄严的国际歌声中宣告闭幕。会后并举行了有高度技术的空军表演和艺术表演。
    我们在波兰各地访问中可以看到，波兰人民是热爱和平的。他们和各个社会主义国家一样正在进行社会主义建设，更需要有一个和平发展的国际环境。但是，波兰人民有自己永远不能忘记的历史教训，几百年来，特别是近几十年来，波兰人民饱尝了被侵略的痛苦。第二次世界大战是从德国法西斯侵略波兰开始的。希特勒军队的铁蹄，差不多踏遍了波兰的领土，他们像日本军阀在中国实行“三光政策”一样，极尽破坏之能事，华沙有80％以上的工厂企业、居民的住宅等遭到严重的破坏，正像波兰人民所说的那样，敌人“想从地图上把华沙抹掉”，所以直到今天仍然可以看到战争的痕迹。我们在波兰东北部参观访问时，看到当年希特勒司令部的旧址。这个司令部设在一个叫“肯却逊”地区的山坳里，有八座坚固的钢骨水泥的地下建筑。当地人民告诉我们：当时希特勒是强迫俘虏和当地居民修建这个碉堡群的，建成以后，为了保密，竟把参加修建的一万多人活活处死。设计这个碉堡群的是一个意大利的工程师，这个工程师在回国时也因飞机“出了事故”而摔死了。对这些骇人听闻的往事，波兰人民记忆犹新。今天希特勒虽然死了，但是希特勒分子仍然存在，他们妄想组织新的十字军东征，他们不承认波兰西部的神圣国界。因之，波兰人民对西德军国主义的复活保持高度的警惕，是很易理解的。
    阿登纳之流为什么敢于这样飞扬跋扈呢？今年1月19日哥穆尔卡同志在庆祝罗兹解放十五周年大会上的讲话中回答了这个问题，他说：“西德军国主义者和复仇主义者本身并不能对世界和平事业有所威胁。他们之所以具有威胁，是因为他们在西方特别是在北大西洋公约组织军事集团中有着有影响的靠山。波兰的先进工人阶级和先进的人民都能深切地体会这个道理。驾汽车送我们到各地访问的一位叫扬·斯塔夏克的司机同志，一路上和我们谈了很多他对帝国主义的看法，他说：“天下的资本家、帝国主义都是一路货，西德也好，美国也好，英国也好，所有的资本家都是剥削和压迫工人，都是侵略别人的。”和我们谈话的许多工人都具有这种阶级观点，这位司机同志不过是一个例子。
    格隆瓦尔德战役是以侵略者的失败而告终，希特勒挑起第二次世界大战，也得到同样的命运。希特勒侵略司令部的强固堡垒群，早已被破坏，当年希特勒办公室的门口，已被荒草淹没，正合着中国一句古话：“固一世之雄也，尔今安在哉？”我们在格隆瓦尔德所在省——奥尔斯汀省博物馆参观时，看到许多格隆瓦尔德战役中的胜利品，其中有许多当时缴获的敌人旗帜的复制品，这些旗帜上，有的画着鹰，有的画着个牛头，有的画着鸡脚人身的怪物……，这些奇形怪状的旗帜，当时是占领者飞扬跋扈的标帜，但是早已送进博物馆里去了。波兰人民今天纪念这个有名的战役，是充满胜利信心的，他们说当年打垮日耳曼侵略者，是依靠斯拉夫民族的团结，依靠波兰人、立陶宛人、俄罗斯人、捷克人的共同奋战。
    今天，依靠社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的团结和斗争，一定可以斩断西德军国主义者的魔手。
    格隆瓦尔德战役纪念虽已过去，但各种实际活动并未结束。现在波兰人民正以提前完成生产任务和工作任务的实际行动，来迎接波兰国庆十六周年。许多基本建设工人提出在7月22日以前把建设项目提前交付使用；波兹南农具制造厂工人写信给哥穆尔卡同志，保证生产更多更好的农业机械支援农业生产。现在全国有六千多个工厂参加了社会主义的劳动竞赛，在波兰国庆十六周年前夕，到处充满了活跃的气氛。
    在一次宴会上，波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、波中友好协会主席英德里霍夫斯基同志，和中国驻波大使王炳南同志、中国新闻工作者代表团的同志们亲切交谈，他告诉我们纪念格隆瓦尔德战役的现实意义，告诉我们波兰人民打败任何新的十字军东征的决心和信心。王炳南同志举杯说：为反对新的十字军东征而干杯！波兰人民反对帝国主义战争政策和侵略政策、维护世界和平的斗争，得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持，得到中国人民的积极支持。中国人民把波兰人民每一斗争的胜利，看作是自己的胜利。我们谨祝波兰人民在反对侵略战争、维护世界和平的斗争中，获得新的更大的胜利。
