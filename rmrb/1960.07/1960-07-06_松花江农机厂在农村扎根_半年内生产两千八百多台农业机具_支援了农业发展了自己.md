The Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Plant, which moved from Harbin to Wuchang County, has grown and strengthened in the countryside. It has not only supported the technological transformation of agriculture but also developed itself.

In the past, this plant made great contributions to supporting agricultural technological transformation. In order to better support agricultural technological transformation, it moved from Harbin to Wuchang County in November last year, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee. In just six months, it has made great achievements in supporting agricultural technological transformation. According to incomplete statistics, it has produced more than 2,800 units of seeders, weeders, plows, harvesters, platform carts, generators, etc., and has also repaired more than 1,200 tractors, diesel engines, and general agricultural machinery for rural people's communes. Together with the two small agricultural machinery plants originally in Wuchang County, the seeders they produced have enabled the mechanization of paddy field seeding throughout the county. The 12.5 kW generators they produced helped five natural villages, including Chonghe People's Commune, to realize electrical lighting. They also provided more than 200 units (pieces) of lathes, vices, files, etc., to support commune industries.

While supporting agricultural technological transformation, they often organize employees to go to the communes to help repair farm tools and provide technical guidance to commune industries. When the water conservancy project in Wuchang County was in the stage of intense construction, they sent seventeen technicians to participate in the battle, and in a few days, they helped the construction site repair thirteen tractors, bulldozers, and automobiles, which promoted the progress of the project.

This factory has tried every possible means to serve agricultural production and actively support agricultural technological transformation, which has also enabled itself to develop rapidly. They originally had more than 300 workers and more than 20 pieces of equipment; now, the production equipment has more than doubled, and the number of production workers has increased to more than 700. The level of production technology has also been greatly improved. In the past, they could only produce general agricultural machinery such as shovel cultivators and planters. Now they can produce more technically complex products such as electric plows, Taigu-style harvesters, generators, and water pumps.

### 松花江农机厂在农村扎根  半年内生产两千八百多台农业机具　支援了农业发展了自己

    松花江农机厂在农村扎根
    半年内生产两千八百多台农业机具　支援了农业发展了自己
    本报讯　从哈尔滨市内迁到五常县的松花江农业机械厂，已在农村成长、壮大。它既支援了农业的技术改造，又发展了自己。
    这个厂过去在支援农业技术改造中，就作出了很大贡献。为了更好地支援农业技术改造，在去年11月，根据市委的指示，从哈尔滨市迁到了五常县。仅仅六个月，对支援农业技术改造已作出了很大成绩。据不完全统计，半年来共生产了播种机、除草机、洋犁、收割机、平台车、发电机等两千八百多台，还为农村人民公社修理拖拉机、柴油机和一般农业机械共一千二百多台。他们和五常县原有的两个小农业机械厂生产的播种机，使全县水田播种实现了机械化。他们生产的十二点五瓩的发电机，帮助冲河人民公社等五个自然屯，实现了照明电气化。他们还抽出车床、虎钳子、锉刀等二百多台（件）支援了公社工业。
    在支援农业技术改造当中，他们经常组织职工到公社去帮助修理农具，并到公社工业中去进行技术指导。在五常县水利工程进行到紧张施工阶段时，他们曾抽出十七名技术工人参加战斗，在几天的时间内就帮助工地修好拖拉机、推土机、汽车等十三台，促进了工程进度。
    这个工厂千方百计地为农业生产服务，积极支援农业技术改造，同时也使自己得到了迅速发展。他们原有三百多名工人、二十多台设备；现在，生产设备比过去增长了一倍多，生产工人已发展到七百多名。生产技术水平也大大提高了，过去他们只能生产铲趟机、点播机等一般农业机械，现在他们已能生产电犁、太古式收割机、发电机、水泵等技术比较复杂的产品。
