Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 28th: The Albanian State Planning Commission's Statistical Bureau today released a communique on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of this year, stating that the industrial plan was 99.6% completed in the first half of the year, an increase of 8.7% compared with the same period last year. The output of many important mining sectors has increased significantly compared with the same period last year. For example, crude oil increased by 41.3%, chromium ore by 14.9%, and iron ore by 42.7%.

The communique said that the product quality of all industrial and mining enterprises has improved compared with previous years in the first half of this year.

The communique pointed out that the drilling plan of the geological department was 104.2% completed, and the drilling workload increased by 13.3% compared with the same period last year.

When discussing the agricultural situation in the first half of this year, the communique pointed out that despite the very bad climatic conditions this year, the sown area by the end of June was still larger than in the same period last year. The cotton planting plan was 101% completed, and rice – 102%.

The communique said that the retail commodity turnover in the first half of this year increased by 4.8% compared with the same period last year. The number of graduates from the eleven-year schools this year increased by 32% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 28th: The "Socialist Labor Team" movement launched in Mongolia more than a year ago has achieved great results and played a significant role in promoting production and raising the technical, political, and cultural level of workers.

Currently, eleven production teams in Mongolia's industrial, mining, transportation, and agricultural and animal husbandry sectors have won the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." A total of 576 production teams across the country are striving to become "Socialist Labor Teams," of which 102 are production teams in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors.

Mongolian railway workers, who first initiated the "Socialist Labor Team" movement, are at the forefront of this movement. The national railway system already has five "Socialist Labor Teams," and 318 other production teams are working hard to win this title. The locomotive repair factory of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau has become the first factory in the country to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" because all its employees have invested in this movement.

In other factories, striving to become a "Socialist Labor Team" has also formed a mass movement. In the Industrial United Factory, more than a dozen production teams have been established to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." They have all put forward their goals and are actively working to fulfill their promises. A production team in the wool selection workshop has completed 112% to 160% of its plan every month in the six months since the team was established, increasing the factory's income by 118,000 tugriks. Another production team completes 176% to 210% of its production plan every month, and all team members have mastered two new technologies.

At the same time, the "Socialist Collaboration Team" movement carried out among intellectuals has also made great progress in the past year. They have established extensive ties with workers and herdsmen, helping them to achieve their competition plans to become "Socialist Labor Teams" and improve their political, technical, and cultural levels. At present, 1,346 intellectuals from all walks of life across the country have formed 127 collaboration teams.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 28th: According to the "Economic Weekly" of the German Democratic Republic, the chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic has recently achieved rapid development. The national chemical products, calculated on a per capita basis, already rank second in the world. The variety of exported chemical products reaches about 2,500.

In recent years, chemists in the German Democratic Republic have created many strange substances, one of which, "Piakryl," can be used to make a wide variety of objects, such as machine parts, textiles, furniture, medical devices, artificial joints, and artificial pupils. A human body model made of this substance, which was exhibited at a recent exhibition in Dusseldorf and is able to show many very complex processes of human organs, such as the flow of blood, has been widely praised by the audience.

In terms of plastics production, according to current statistics, the national plastics output, calculated on a per capita basis, ranks sixth in the world, averaging six kilograms per person. It is estimated that by 1965, the average will reach sixteen kilograms per person. The output of various plastics will be greatly increased. Among them, the output of polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene will reach 120,000 tons and 20,000 tons respectively by 1965.

The weekly also reported that chemical industry monopoly organizations in Western countries have long kept secret the formulas for some catalysts in the chemical industry. However, after hard work, chemists in the German Democratic Republic have not only discovered these secrets themselves, but also obtained many valuable inventions. For example, they have created catalysts for the production of synthetic fuels, synthetic fibers, plastics, etc., and discovered a method for producing cheaper polyethylene. Recently, the "Wolfen" factory, which produces sulfuric acid, has the cheapest production cost in the world due to the adoption of a series of advanced working methods.

    新华社地拉那28日电　阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会统计局今天发表今年上半年国民经济计划执行情况的公报说：今年上半年，工业计划完成了99.6％，比去年同期增加了8.7％。许多重要的采矿部门的产量比去年同期有了显著的增加。例如，原油增加了41.3％，铬矿增加了14.9％，铁矿增加了42.7％。
    公报说，今年上半年各工矿企业的产品质量都比往年有了改进。
    公报指出，地质部门的钻探计划完成了104.2％，钻探工作量比去年同期增加了13.3％。
    公报在谈到今年上半年的农业情况时指出，尽管今年气候条件很坏，但到6月底为止，播种面积仍比去年同期有所增加。棉花种植计划完成了101％，水稻——102％。
    公报说，今年上半年零售商品周转额比去年同期增加了4.8％。今年十一年制学校的毕业生数目比去年同期增加32％。
    新华社乌兰巴托28日电　蒙古在一年多以前开展的“社会主义劳动队”运动已经取得了巨大成绩，对推动生产、提高职工的技术、政治和文化水平起了很大的作用。
    目前，在蒙古工矿、交通和农牧业部门中，已经有十一个生产队获得了“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。全国共有五百七十六个生产队正在争取成为“社会主义劳动队”，其中有一百零二个是农牧业部门的生产队。
    首先倡议开展“社会主义劳动队”运动的蒙古铁路工人，走在这个运动的最前列。全国铁路系统已有五个“社会主义劳动队”，还有三百一十八个生产队正在为争取这个称号而努力。乌兰巴托铁路局机车修理厂由于全体职工都投入了这个运动，因而成了全国最早的一家争取“社会主义劳动队”的工厂。
    在其他工厂中，争取成为“社会主义劳动队”也形成了群众性的运动。在工业联合工厂中，就成立了十多个争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的生产队。它们都提出了奋斗指标，并积极努力实现自己的诺言。选毛车间的一个生产队在建队以来的六个月中，每月都完成计划112％到160％，为工厂增加收入十一万八千图格里克。另一个生产队每月完成生产计划176％到210％，全体队员还掌握了两种新技术。
    与此同时，在知识分子中开展的“社会主义协作队”运动一年来也有很大发展。他们和工人、牧民建立了广泛的联系，帮助工人、牧民实现争取成为“社会主义劳动队”的竞赛计划，提高政治、技术和文化水平。现在，全国已有一千三百四十六名各行各业的知识分子组成了一百二十七个协作队。
    新华社柏林28日电　据德意志民主共和国“经济周报”报道：德意志民主共和国的化学工业最近获得了迅速的发展。全国的化学产品按人口平均计算，已经占世界第二位。出口化学产品的品种达二千五百种左右。
    德意志民主共和国的化学家最近几年来创造了许多种奇异的物质，其中一种“皮阿克里尔”可以制造各式各样的物件，如机器零件、纺织品、家具、医疗器械、人造关节和人造瞳孔等。最近在杜塞尔多夫举行的一个展览会上展出的一个用这种物质制成的人体模型，它能够显示人体器官许多非常复杂的过程，如血液流动的情况等，受到了观众普遍的赞赏。
    在塑料生产方面，根据目前的统计，全国的塑料产量按人口平均计算占世界第六位，平均每人六公斤。预计到1965年，每人平均将达十六公斤。各种塑料的产量都将大大增加。其中聚氯乙烯和聚苯乙烯的产量到1965年将分别达到十二万吨和二万吨。
    这家周报还报道，西方国家化学工业垄断组织长期以来对化学工业中一些触媒剂的处方保守秘密。但是，德意志民主共和国的化学家经过刻苦的钻研，不但自己发现了这些秘密，而且还获得了许多珍贵的发明。例如制成了生产合成燃料、人造纤维、塑料等的触媒剂，发现了生产更便宜的聚乙烯的方法等。最近，生产硫酸的“沃尔芬”工厂由于采用了一系列先进的工作方法，生产成本是世界上最便宜的。
