    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 7th: Several thousand Cuban metallurgical workers gathered last night at the Cuban Workers' Confederation Theater here, strongly protesting the US government's measures to stop importing Cuban sugar and vowing to defend the motherland.

    Prime Minister Castro attended the rally and spoke at the meeting. He said that the Cuban people would never yield to the United States. He called on the people to kick away the US aggression with greater courage and continue to move forward.

    Referring to the US's unreasonable reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota, Castro pointed out, "When violent regimes supported by US financial oligarchs exploited our farmers, there was no reduction in the sugar import quota, because the violent regimes carried out plunder and massacre to protect the interests of US financial oligarchs."

    He condemned imperialism and traitors, saying: "Aggression and betrayal cannot frighten us." He said that the United States can cancel Cuba's sugar quota, but it can never make Cuba yield. He said, we will never yield, on the contrary, we are proud of the role we have played in the struggle for liberation of the people of all countries, and we are satisfied that these interest groups are attacking us.

    Castro pointed out that the difficulties in US-Cuba relations are the result of the US's implementation of imperialist policies and the US's attempt to dominate Cuba.

    He warned, "We cannot but say to this powerful oligarchy: you have done everything that was expected, but you will also get everything that can be expected from us."

    He went on to say that the Cuban people are stronger than the arrogant oligarchy that rules the United States. The US attempt to destroy the Cuban revolution will only make the revolution stronger and more determined.

    Castro pointed out that what troubles the United States is that the Cuban people can move forward without the United States, and what will trouble the United States even more is that the Cuban people are advancing in the fight against US imperialism. The Cuban people understand that their struggle has just begun, and they must kick away US aggression with greater courage and continue to move forward.

    The masses present shouted angrily: "Down with US imperialism!" They solemnly shouted, holding up the national flag: "We will win!"

    Jesus Soto, organizing secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, announced at the meeting that the Cuban Workers' Confederation had decided to organize a large-scale demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace on Sunday to condemn US imperialist aggression, expressing the people's support for the government and defending the revolution at any cost. His speech was met with a storm of applause, and everyone shouted "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!"

    The conference received many telegrams from people of all strata from all over Cuba, expressing their support for the revolutionary government against US imperialist aggression. Amidst thunderous applause, telegrams from trade unions in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Argentina were also read out, unanimously expressing support for the Cuban revolution, condemning US aggression, and congratulating the Cuban government on taking over US enterprises.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Washington news: US President Eisenhower chaired a meeting of the National Security Council on the 7th. According to US government officials afterward, "The Cuban crisis occupied an important place on the agenda of this meeting."

    Eisenhower convened this meeting of the highest decision-making body of the US government at a time when the United States is intensifying the plotting of interference and aggression against Cuba. Just the day before, Eisenhower brazenly announced the reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota, a new measure threatening Cuba. According to Western news agencies, at this meeting, which lasted an hour and a half, Eisenhower and his "senior advisers" planned future ways to deal with Cuba.

    It is worth noting that at a time when the US government is plotting further interference in Cuba, calls for armed aggression against Cuba are becoming increasingly rampant in the United States. A report submitted by the Domestic Security Committee of the US National Association of Attorneys General to the ongoing convention in San Francisco openly stated that the United States cannot "stand idly by" regarding the legitimate actions taken by the Cuban revolutionary government to take over foreign oil companies in order to safeguard national sovereignty and counter interference plots. The report believes that the US government's economic interference in Cuba "is not enough" and that "force should be used" to interfere in Cuba. The chairman of this committee, Wyman, further pointed out that the "force" referred to here is "the US Marine Corps."

    The US official mouthpiece, the US Information Service, has also relayed a large number of speeches by US reactionary politicians and newspapers that viciously attack the Cuban revolutionary government in the past two days. US Democratic Senator Mansfield issued a statement on the 7th, clamoring that the US's "patience" is "limited," and advocating that the United States take further interference actions against Cuba.

    Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a report from Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, by Latin American News Agency on the 5th, Joaquin Solis Piura, chairman of the Student Union of the National University of Nicaragua, revealed that an armed invasion against the Cuban revolution is being prepared. He said that the invasion plan was "formulated according to an agreement signed between the United Fruit Company of the United States, the US State Department, and Nicaraguan ruler Luis Somoza, Guatemalan ruler Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, and Dominican ruler Rafael Trujillo."

    The Nicaraguan student leader said that the number of Cuban war criminals entering Nicaragua is increasing, and a group of Cuban war criminals and mercenaries from other countries are being trained at Coyotepe Fortress in Nicaragua, stepping up preparations for various activities to invade Cuba.

    Piura revealed that US Air Force Caribbean Area Commander General Stranahan recently visited Nicaragua, and he left after holding talks with US Ambassador to Nicaragua Thomas Whelan and other local people. He said, "FBI agents, one of the leaders of the conspiracy, Colonel Jules Dubois, has also been to Nicaragua."

    Piura said, we must defend Cuba, because Cuba is opposing the tyranny that oppresses us in our country: the US monopoly forces.

    古巴冶金工人誓师保卫祖国　卡斯特罗发出庄严号召
    以更大的勇气踢开美国继续前进
    美国剑拔弩张加紧策划干涉和侵略古巴的阴谋
    据新华社哈瓦那7日电　几千名古巴冶金工人昨晚在这里的古巴工人联合会剧院集会，强烈抗议美国政府采取的停止进口古巴食糖的措施誓师保卫祖国。
    卡斯特罗总理参加了这次集会并在会上讲了话。他说，古巴人民决不会向美国屈服。他号召人民以更大的勇气踢开美国侵略而继续前进。
    卡斯特罗在谈到美国无理削减古巴糖的进口限额时指出，“当受到美国金融寡头支持的暴力政权剥削我们的农民的时候，不发生削减糖的进口限额的事，因为暴力政权进行掠夺和屠杀是为了保护美国金融寡头的利益”。
    他谴责帝国主义和卖国贼，他说：“侵略和背叛都吓不倒我们”。他说，美国可以取消古巴的食糖定额，但是决不能使古巴屈服。他说，我们决不会屈服，正相反，我们为自己在各国人民争取解放的斗争中所起的作用感到骄傲，我们为这些利益集团攻击我们而感到满意。
    卡斯特罗指出，美国和古巴关系中的困难是美国执行帝国主义政策的结果，是由于美国企图统治古巴。
    他警告说，“我们不能不对这个强大的寡头说：你已经做了众所预期的一切，但是你们也将得到从我们这里可以期待得到的一切”。
    他接着说，古巴人民比统治着美国的傲慢的寡头更加强大。美国想摧毁古巴革命的企图只会使革命更加强大、更加坚定。
    卡斯特罗指出，使美国感到苦恼的是，古巴人民没有美国也能前进，而将使美国更为苦恼的是，古巴人民在反对美帝国主义中前进。古巴人民懂得，他们的斗争刚开始，要以更大的勇气踢开美国侵略继续前进。
    到会的群众不断发出怒吼：“打倒美帝国主义！”他们高举着国旗庄严地高呼：“我们必胜！”
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托在会上宣布，古巴工人联合会决定星期日在总统府前组织一次谴责美帝国主义侵略的大规模示威，表示人民不惜任何牺牲地支持政府和保卫革命。他的讲话受到全场暴风雨般的欢呼声，大家高呼“要古巴、不要美国佬”。
    大会收到古巴全国各地各阶层人民拍来的许多电报，表示支持革命政府反对美帝国主义的侵略。在暴风雨般的掌声中还宣读了哥伦比亚、巴西、秘鲁和阿根廷等国的工会发来的电报，这些电报一致表示支持古巴革命，谴责美国侵略，并对古巴政府接管美国企业表示祝贺。
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔七日主持了国家安全委员会会议。据美国政府官员事后透露，“古巴危机在这次会议的议程上占了重要的地位”。
    艾森豪威尔是在美国加紧策划干涉和侵略古巴的阴谋的情况下，召集这个美国政府最高决策机构的会议的。就在前一天，艾森豪威尔悍然宣布削减古巴食糖进口份额这个新的威胁古巴的措施，据西方通讯社透露，在这次历时达一个半小时的会议上，艾森豪威尔同他的“高级顾问们”策划了今后对付古巴的办法。
    值得注意的是，在美国政府策划进一步干涉古巴的时候，美国国内武装侵略古巴的叫嚷越益嚣张。美国国会检察官协会的国内安全委员会向目前正在旧金山举行的代表大会提出的一项报告公然声称，美国对古巴革命政府为维护国家主权和反击干涉阴谋而采取的接管外国石油公司的正当行动不能“袖手旁观”。报告认为，美国政府对古巴进行的经济干涉“是不够的”，“应该用武力”来干涉古巴。这个委员会的主席魏曼还进一步指出，这里所说的“武力”指的就是“美国海军陆战队”。
    美国官方的喉舌美国新闻处最近两天来也转播了大量美国反动政客和报刊恶毒攻击古巴革命政府的言论。美国民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德7日发表一项声明，叫嚷美国的“耐心”是“有限度的”，鼓吹美国要对古巴采取进一步的干涉行动。
    新华社6日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社5日自乌拉圭首都蒙德维的亚报道，尼加拉瓜国立大学学生会主席华金·索利斯·皮乌拉揭露，对古巴革命进行的一次武装侵入正在准备中。他说，这次侵略计划是“根据美国联合果品公司、美国国务院以及尼加拉瓜统治者路易斯·索摩查、危地马拉统治者米格尔·伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯和多米尼加统治者拉斐尔·特鲁希略之间签订的一个协定制定的”。
    这位尼加拉瓜大学生领导人说，进入尼加拉瓜的古巴战争罪犯日益增多，有一批古巴战犯和其他国家的雇佣军正在尼加拉瓜的科约特佩堡受训，他们在加紧准备侵攻古巴的各种活动。
    皮乌拉揭露说，美国加勒比地区空军司令斯特兰纳汉将军不久前访问了尼加拉瓜，他是在同美国驻尼加拉瓜大使托马斯·惠伦和其他当地人士进行会谈之后才离开的。他说，“（美国）联邦调查局特务、阴谋活动的领导人之一朱耳斯·杜波依斯上校也到过尼加拉瓜”。
    皮乌拉说，我们要保卫古巴，因为古巴正在反对在我国压迫我们的暴政：美国垄断势力。
