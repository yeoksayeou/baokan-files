    Targeting Bulky Size and Unreasonable Structure:
    Over 100 Products in Guangzhou Undergo a Complete Makeover
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou) Since the start of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, workers in Guangzhou's machinery and electrical industries have been vigorously engaged in product revolution, and have already reformed 173 old products. After the reforms, these products have not only greatly improved efficiency, but can also save more than 1,700 tons of metal materials and more than 1 million man-hours annually.
    Many old products produced by Guangzhou's machinery and electrical industries previously suffered from the shortcomings of being bulky and having unreasonable structures. Some diesel engines and steam engines were more than one-third heavier than products from advanced regions of the country. The product range was also very complex, with multiple specifications for the same model, causing many inconveniences during manufacturing. After these products were reformed, they now have the advantages of being smaller in size, lighter in weight, using less material, requiring fewer man-hours, having lower costs, better quality, and higher efficiency. The 40-horsepower steam engine produced by Gonghexiang Machinery Factory used to be large, had low horsepower, and was labor-intensive to manufacture. After this product design reform, the weight of each unit was reduced from 2,200 kilograms to 400 kilograms, the power was increased from the original 40 horsepower to 45 horsepower, and the engine speed increased from 40-50 revolutions per minute to 1,500 revolutions per minute. At the same time, it can also save 75% of man-hours, achieving the goal of making one part of material do the work of five, and one man-hour do the work of four.

    针对体积笨重和结构不合理开刀
    广州一百多种产品面目全新
    据新华社广州电　广州市机电工业职工在技术革新、技术革命运动中，大搞产品革命以来已经改革了一百七十三种老产品。这些产品经过改革不仅大大提高了效能，而且全年可以节约出一千七百多吨金属材料和一百多万个制造工时。
    广州市机电行业生产的许多老产品，过去存在着体积笨重、结构不合理的缺点。有的柴油机、蒸汽机，比全国先进地区的产品重了三分之一以上。产品品种也很复杂，同一种型号的产品就有多种规格，制造过程中诸多不便。这些产品经过改革后，现在都具有体积小、重量轻、用料少、工时少、成本低、质量好、效能高的优点。公和祥机器厂生产的四十马力蒸汽机，过去体积大，马力小，制造费工，经过这次改革产品设计，每台重量由二千二百公斤减轻到四百公斤，功率由原来的四十马力增大到四十五马力，发动机转速从每分钟四五十转增加到一千五百转，同时还可节约75％的工时，做到一分材料顶五分用，一个工时顶四个用。
