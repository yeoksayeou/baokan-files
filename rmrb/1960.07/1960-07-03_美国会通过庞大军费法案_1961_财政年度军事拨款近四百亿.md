Xinhua News Agency, 2nd July: Washington dispatch: The US Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, passed the military appropriations bill for fiscal year 1961 on June 30th, stipulating that the US government's military appropriation for this year is $39,996,600,080, which is $661,600,080 more than the US government originally requested.

The Congressional bill was passed under circumstances where the US ruling clique is making every effort to advocate further arms expansion to intensify war preparations. During the vote, members of both the currently ruling Republican Party and the "opposition" Democratic Party supported the bill. Some members, such as Democratic Senators Symington and Clark, even believed that such huge military spending was "not enough" and demanded further increases.

    美国会通过庞大军费法案
    1961财政年度军事拨款近四百亿
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会参众两院6月30日通过了1961财政年度的军事拨款法案，规定美国政府这一年度的军事拨款为三百九十九亿九千六百六十万零八千美元，比美国政府原来要求的多六亿六千一百六十万零八千美元。
    国会这个法案是在美国统治集团竭力鼓吹进一步扩军以加紧战争准备的情况下通过的。在表决时，目前执政的共和党和“在野”的民主党的议员们都支持这个法案。一些议员，例如民主党参议员薛明顿和克拉克，甚至认为这样庞大的军事开支还“不够”，要求进一步增加。
