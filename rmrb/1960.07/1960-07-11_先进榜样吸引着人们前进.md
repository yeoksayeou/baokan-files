　　Advanced Role Models Attract People to Move Forward
    In the past two months or so, *Nanfang Daily* has systematically conducted propaganda and reporting on improving the work style and leadership methods of cadres, established advanced models in various fields, and used them as role models for the vast number of rural cadres, creating a strong momentum and vigorously promoting them, which has achieved relatively significant results.
  *Nanfang Daily*'s publicity campaign began with the comparative report on two communes in Dongguan County—Daojiao Commune and Machong Commune—published on April 25. Daojiao Commune, because its cadres promoted the Party's fine traditions and implemented the mass line, transformed this consistently backward commune into an advanced one; in contrast, Machong Commune, because its leadership was tainted with bureaucratic habits, failed to do a good job in production and failed to properly arrange the lives of the masses, resulting in this previously advanced commune becoming backward. On that day, the newspaper published an editorial guiding people to observe problems from a dialectical materialist viewpoint, that is, to clearly recognize that the current excellent situation in rural areas is the mainstream; but also to clearly see that some cadres have bureaucratic habits that are divorced from the masses, which is a nascent negative factor. Although this negative factor is an isolated phenomenon, its harm is very great. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly create conditions to make this negative factor move towards its opposite, so as to further improve the people's communes and promote a more rapid development of productive forces. After this, the newspaper continued to publish some comparative reports of advanced and backward examples, in conjunction with rural production work.
    While publishing some comparative reports and raising the issue of earnestly improving work style, *Nanfang Daily* paid special attention to vigorously publicizing advanced models. The newspaper focused on reporting the following four advanced models: the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee decided that cadres at both the prefectural and county levels should leave their offices and spend five months and seven months of each year going deep into the masses; cadres of Datang Commune in Sanshui County, with a dauntless spirit of self-sacrifice, went deep into the "poisonous land" where schistosomiasis was extremely serious, took the lead in charging forward, and eliminated the plague god within a set time, changing the natural landscape; the Sulong General Party Branch of Sulong Brigade in Luoding County resolutely followed the mass line, highly concerned about the lives of the masses, and played the role of a fighting fortress; and Ye Yang, a model Party member and model cadre, secretary of the Shishui Brigade General Party Branch in Diancheng Commune, Dianbai County, lived, ate, worked, and consulted with the masses day after day for ten years. In this way, the prefectural, county, commune, and brigade-level Party committees and grassroots cadres throughout the province had role models to learn from. It can be seen that the newspaper's publicity was planned. These reports immediately aroused a wide response. Many Party committees held special meetings and decided to launch a movement to learn from these advanced models. Cadres in many areas used the relevant reports as study documents, compared and examined themselves, and immediately improved their work style. Cadres at the prefectural and county levels in various places successively left their offices and went deep into the front lines of production. Grassroots cadres generally ate, lived, worked, and consulted with commune members. After studying Ye Yang's model deeds, the cadres of Cuibei Brigade in Diancheng Commune, Dianbai County, converted the brigade's excessive number of twelve bicycles into transport vehicles for accumulating fertilizer and managing side occupations. There are many such touching examples. The newspaper then continuously reported news from various places about learning from advanced models with practical actions, creating a strong momentum and further promoting the movement of cadres throughout the province to learn from and catch up with advanced elements. The newspaper also used concise forms to widely commend many outstanding cadres on various fronts in rural areas, achieving a combination of large, medium, and small typical reports.
    In carrying out this series of reports, *Nanfang Daily* published many commentaries. The newspaper strived to raise these reports to the level of publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the actual situation, and explained the active role of proactively adjusting and improving the superstructure, publicizing Chairman Mao's views on leadership methods and caring for the lives of the masses. The newspaper's theoretical section also cooperated in the publicity. Therefore, this publicity was also relatively ideological.

### 先进榜样吸引着人们前进

　　先进榜样吸引着人们前进
    南方日报在最近两个多月以来，有计划有系统地进行关于改进干部工作作风和领导方法的宣传报道，树立了各方面的先进典型，把他们作为广大农村干部的榜样，大造声势，大力推广，已经收到了比较显著的效果。
  南方日报的这项宣传，是以4月25日发表东莞县两个公社——道?公社与麻涌公社的对比报道为起点的。道?公社由于干部发扬了党的优良作风，贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，结果使这个一贯比较落后的公社变成了先进公社；与此相反，麻涌公社由于领导上沾染了官僚主义的习气，既没有做好生产工作，又没有妥善安排群众生活，结果使这个一向先进的公社变成了落后公社。这一天，报纸发表了社论，引导人们以辩证唯物主义的观点去观察问题，就是既要明确地认识目前农村的大好形势是主流方面；又要清楚地看到，在一部分干部中存在着脱离群众的官僚主义习气，这是一种开始露头的消极因素。尽管这种消极因素是个别的现象，但是它的危害性却是很大的。因此，必须迅速地创造条件，使这种消极因素走向它们的反面，才能够进一步把人民公社办得更好，推动生产力更加迅速地发展。在这以后，报纸结合农村生产工作，继续发表了一些先进和落后的对比报道。
    南方日报在发表一些对比报道，提出认真改进作风问题的同时，特别注意大张旗鼓地宣传先进典型。报纸着重地报道了如下四个先进典型：汕头地委决定地委和县委两级干部走出办公室，每年以五个月和七个月的时间深入到群众中去；三水县大塘公社干部以大无畏的自我牺牲的精神，深入血吸虫病极为严重的“毒地”，带头冲锋陷阵，限期消灭瘟神，改变了自然面貌；罗定县素龙公社素龙大队党总支坚决走群众路线，高度关怀群众生活，发挥了战斗堡垒作用；模范党员、模范干部——电白县电城公社湿水大队党总支书记叶养十年如一日地与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量。这样，就使全省的地委、县委、公社、大队四级党委和基层干部都有了学习的榜样。可以看出，报纸的宣传是有计划的。这些报道立即引起了广泛的反应，不少党委召开专门会议，决定开展学习这些先进典型的运动，不少地区的干部把有关的报道作为学习文件，对照检查自己，立即改进作风。各地的地、县两级干部先后走出办公室，深入生产第一线。基层干部普遍地与社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。电白县电城公社萃陂大队的干部在学习了叶养的模范事迹以后，把大队里过多的十二架自行车，全部改成运输车，用于积肥和经营副业。像这样的动人事例是很多的。报纸随即连续地报道了各地用实际行动向先进典型学习的消息，大造声势，进一步推动了全省干部学先进赶先进的运动。报纸还用短小精悍的形式，对农村中各条战线上的许多优秀干部进行广泛的表扬，做到大中小典型报道相结合。
    南方日报在进行这一系列的报道时，发表了不少评论。报纸力求把这些报道提高到宣传毛泽东思想的水平上来，结合实际情况，阐明主动调整和改善上层建筑的积极作用，宣传毛主席关于领导方法、关心群众生活的一些观点。报纸的理论版也配合进行宣传。因此这一宣传也是比较有思想性的。
