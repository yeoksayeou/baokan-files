Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch. Amidst the most rampant second wave of large-scale forced relocation and anti-Chinese activities stirred up by powerful groups in Indonesia, a sudden fire broke out around 2 a.m. on June 25th in Bagan Siapi-api, Riau Province, a city primarily inhabited by overseas Chinese. The cause of the fire is unknown.

According to Medan newspapers, the fire reduced over 200 houses to ashes, leaving approximately 3,000 people homeless, almost all of whom are overseas Chinese.

The overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire are extremely poor, many of them being fishermen. At the time of the fire, many strong young men were fishing at sea, leaving only the elderly and children at home, who fled in panic, barely escaping with their lives. Many other fire victims were overseas Chinese who lost their jobs due to the ban on foreign small traders operating in rural areas, and they had been living a very difficult life. The scene after the fire was extremely tragic.

According to newspaper reports, the fire broke out at two o'clock, but the fire engine did not arrive there until four o'clock, and then broke down, so it could not extinguish the fire in time. Fortunately, the residents there bravely carried out rescue work, and the entire city was not completely burned down.

This is the third major fire in Indonesian cities with a majority of overseas Chinese residents. The first occurred in Bangka, Kalimantan, affecting 5,000 people. The second was in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, affecting 8,000 people.

Bagan Siapi-api is Indonesia's largest fishing ground. Eighty years ago, this place was a wilderness, developed by overseas Chinese who migrated there.

    在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起排华逆流中
    又一华侨聚居城市发生大火灾
    二百多座房屋化为灰烬　约三千人无家可归
    新华社2日讯　在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的第二次大规模迫迁排华活动最猖狂的时候，6月25日清晨二时左右在大多数居民是华侨的廖内省巴眼亚比突然发生了大火。大火的原因不详。
    据棉兰报纸报道，火灾使二百多座房屋化为灰烬，约三千人无家可归，这些受害者几乎都是华侨。
    遭受火灾的华侨非常贫困，其中许多是渔民。在起火的时候，许多健壮青年正在海上捕鱼，家中只剩下老年人和儿童，他们仓惶逃命，仅以身免。还有许多火灾受害者是由于禁止外国小商贩在乡村地区营业而失业的华侨，他们一直过着非常艰苦的生活。火灾后那里的情景非常凄惨。
    据报纸消息说，火灾在两点钟发生，可是救火车到四点钟才赶往那里，并且又发生故障，因此不能及时扑灭火灾。幸亏那里的居民英勇进行抢救，整个城市才未被完全烧毁。
    这是在大部分居民为华侨的印度尼西亚城市发生的第三次大火。第一次发生在加里曼丹的邦戛，受害者达五千人。第二次在廖内省的石叻班让，受害者达八千人。
    巴眼亚比是印度尼西亚最大的渔场。在八十年前，这个地方还是一片荒地，它是由迁居到那里的华侨开发的。
