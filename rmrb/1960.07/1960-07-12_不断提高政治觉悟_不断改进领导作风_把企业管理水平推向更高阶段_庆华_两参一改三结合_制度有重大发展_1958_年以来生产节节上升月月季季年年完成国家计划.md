Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th: The Qinghua Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province, based on the spirit of combining the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, has unswervingly consolidated, improved, and developed the system of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations," enabling this system to undergo significant development in the new situation of sustained production leaps. This new development marks a new stage in enterprise management. Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory in developing the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system and comprehensively improving the level of enterprise management.

The new development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system is characterized by: gradually expanding the scope of worker participation in management and enriching the content of management; office cadres learning to use political work methods to carry out economic work; and forming a top-down, crisscrossing enterprise management network.

The "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system was summarized and implemented by the Qinghua Tool Factory in 1958, using a combination of learning and originality. Over the past two years, with the vigorous development of the Great Leap Forward in production and the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and the soaring increase in productivity, the Qinghua Tool Factory has adhered to and developed the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system, thereby more comprehensively and systematically solving some new problems encountered in enterprise management.

The basic characteristics of the new development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system in the Qinghua Tool Factory are: on the basis of continuously improving the political thinking, management skills, and cultural and technical level of workers, gradually expanding the scope of worker participation in management, enriching the content of worker participation in management, establishing order for worker participation in management, and improving the level of worker participation in management, making worker participation in group management the foundation for doing a good job in various aspects of enterprise management. At the same time, office cadres have clearly established the view of facing production and serving production; learned to use political work methods to carry out economic work, and to carry out management work by launching mass movements on a large scale. Reforming management systems is combined with reforming management tools, reforming professional management is combined with reforming mass management, and the method of combining destruction and construction is used to continuously reform operations and continuously improve the work style and work methods of cadres, establishing a new work system and new work methods that combine work, labor, and study. On the basis of increasingly solid mass management and increasingly strengthened professional management, the "Three Combinations" form is widely used to closely combine professional management with mass management, forming a strict, top-down, crisscrossing enterprise management network, bringing enterprise management work into a new stage.

Management work becomes more and more detailed, more comprehensive, and better; production groups have become the main activity place for political, economic, and cultural learning

Since the Qinghua Tool Factory implemented worker participation in group management in 1958, workers have developed from managing some of the daily work of the group's production scheduling, original records, attendance, material distribution and storage, to participating in the overall management of planning, technology, and costs. In terms of planning management, it has developed from discussing the implementation of plans and formulating guarantee measures to formulating group work plans; this has given production plans a broader mass base and guaranteed the advanced reliability of the plans. In terms of technical management, workers have participated in quality analysis, product design, new product trial production, revision of process regulations, handling of rationalization proposals, and technical research on high-grade, large-scale, precision, advanced, and new products, which better combines technical theory with production practice. Because the scope of worker participation in group management has gradually expanded, in terms of cost management, this factory can not only carry out economic accounting at the team and group level, but also develop from accounting on a group and monthly basis to daily accounting, weekly analysis, and monthly summaries on a single product and quota basis, closely combining accounting, analysis, and supervision, forming a new situation in which everyone engages in cost accounting and everyone cares about economic results. Now, all workers in the factory are very careful about every drop of oil, every piece of rag, and every material head. The Sanba Group of the Second Workshop took a series of measures in the use of auxiliary materials, and even a piece of rag was "washed after use and used after washing." In 1959 alone, the cost savings reached more than 15,000 yuan, equivalent to 2.7 times the group's total annual salary. The excellent work style of hard work and thrift in running the enterprise by the vast number of employees has ensured that the factory's costs are reduced month by month, with comparable product costs reduced by 1.52% in January, 4.27% in February, 6.13% in March, continuously declining by 7.9% in April, and further declining by 17.49% in May. The continuous expansion of the scope of group management is inseparable from the increasing number of workers participating in management and the continuous improvement of the level of worker administrators. The Qinghua Tool Factory has continuously improved the level of workers' management skills through the establishment of a reserve system, a master-apprentice one-position system, and a one-position multi-employee system. More than 90% of the factory's groups are well-managed. According to the results of the recent factory-wide management work sports meeting test and evaluation, 50% of the factory's worker administrators have reached the professional level of similar professional administrators, and more than 20% of the worker administrators can basically be competent for the work of workshop functional group leaders and workshop directors. With the continuous enrichment of worker administrators' management knowledge, all groups in the factory have established relatively complete management systems. Such as: four books (handover logbook, technical security education logbook, rationalization proposal registration book, meeting minutes book), five accounts (material receipt and dispatch account, tool receipt and dispatch account, product receipt and dispatch account, man-hour record account, product inspection account), eight tables (product progress registration table, product daily report, economic accounting dynamic table, etc.) and eleven management systems, and through pre-shift and post-shift meetings, weekend economic activity analysis meetings, early-month plan implementation and end-of-month summary evaluations and other five regular meetings, to achieve one inspection a day, one analysis a week, a plan at the beginning of the month, and a summary at the end of the month, making group management work more and more detailed, more comprehensive, and better. In particular, Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League groups were established in production groups as units. In the groups, taking production as the center and the Party group as the core, they not only grasped production and management, but also grasped ideology, study, and life. This not only makes the production group a strong administrative organization at the enterprise level and the foundation of the entire management work, but also becomes the main activity place for political and ideological work and technical and cultural learning.

All cadres above the section level in the factory regularly work for one month each year; general cadres work one day a week

Cadre participation in labor in the Qinghua Tool Factory has been planned, systemized, and regularized. Over the past two years, all cadres in the factory have combined fixed, unfixed, and regular and irregular labor in adhering to participate in labor, such as generals being soldiers, planting experimental fields, rotating assignments, following-shift labor, grasping key points, on-site office work, and regular rotation of workers and cadres, combining cadre participation in labor with regular in-depth production and leadership production. Now, all cadres above the section level in the factory take turns going to production groups as workers for one month each year, general office cadres concentrate on going to groups as workers for two months each year, and workshop cadres regularly participate in labor for two days a week, participating in production leadership production. Generally, where key problems appear, there are leading cadres participating in labor, who set an example and lead the masses to solve key problems. Therefore, weak links in production are broken through in a timely manner, ensuring the steady rise of production. According to last year's annual statistics, cadres discovered and solved more than 7,800 production, technical, and management problems in their participation in labor. Cadre participation in labor not only solves problems in production in a timely manner and improves management levels, but also gradually learns and masters production technical knowledge. Now, all cadres in the factory can generally master more than one type of work and the operating techniques of three to five processes. More than 75% of the cadres and workers in the Fifth Workshop have implemented regular rotation.

Due to the expansion of the scope of worker participation in management, as well as the reform of rules and regulations and the emergence of new management tools, the workload of office operations has been greatly reduced, giving cadres more time to participate in production and go deep into reality. Now, office cadres have generally implemented the "one-labor three-thirds system" (that is, cadres above the section chief level regularly participate in labor for one month each year, general cadres work one day a week in addition to two months of labor each year, and the rest of the time is roughly divided into processing operations, going deep down, and learning). The implementation of this system has played a significant role in cadres going deep into production, adhering to labor, and learning. According to preliminary statistics, the time that office cadres spend on on-site office work accounts for about half of the working time, and 80% of the problems are solved on the spot. All levels of cadres in the factory have also established fixed contact points with production groups, regularly going deep, focusing on cultivation, and working with the workers with one heart, one mind, and one way. Therefore, the workers said: "When cadres work in the workshop, their ideology and work style change greatly, management improvements are promising, and experience summaries are spread everywhere."

Over the past two years, this factory has carried out three relatively centralized and comprehensive reforms in rules and regulations. This reform is carried out according to the needs of the great development of production in each period. For example: the third major reform of rules and regulations carried out at the beginning of 1960 was carried out in the new situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," and on the basis of the close combination of professional management and mass management. The spearhead of this reform was first directed at process regulations and operating regulations, as well as labor organization and production organization. This reform revised a total of 1,576 process regulations, accounting for 84% of the factory's process regulations. This reform grasped the principle of acting cautiously, destroying and building simultaneously, and combining destruction and construction, achieving fast, detailed, and good reforms, thus adapting to the needs of sustained production leaps. For example, the journal vouchers of the planning and finance section were reduced from 32 books to 26 books, and then to 7 books; after this reform, only one book was left, fundamentally changing the unreasonable phenomenon of mutual division and repeated calculation of accounts, greatly simplifying financial procedures, and making accounts more reasonable. Therefore, the number of closing personnel was reduced from twelve to three, the closing time was reduced from ten days to four days, and work efficiency was increased tenfold. In addition, many advanced tools have been created in accounting, production management, and technical management.

The factory has established ten management lines that combine professional management and mass management according to ten sections, achieving top-down movement, bottom-up knowledge, and consistent action

In the application of "Three Combinations," there have been new developments from form to content. It is not only widely used in production technology research, but also widely used in all aspects of management work, which is prominently manifested in the close combination of professional management and mass management. Now, the factory has formed a management network from point to line, top and bottom connection, left and right connection, and tight interweaving. A set of methods for combination and linkage has been explored in organization and systems. In the workshop, there are "Three Combinations" operation meetings of the director, professional personnel, and production group leader. In the office, there are three-level (section, workshop, group) joint business meetings, and there are cooperation meetings, liaison meetings, and "Four Combinations" (production, technology, inspection, and acceptance) meetings between offices. The factory has established ten management lines that combine professional management and mass management according to ten sections. Each section conducts a "ten-line one-net three-combination" grand competition in the business system with the workshop group running to the end, achieving top-down linkage, interlocking, top-down movement, bottom-up knowledge, and consistent action, communicating information at any time, solving problems in a timely manner, and forming a set of "six-fast" management methods that both ensure work quality and adapt to the leap forward development of production (quickly reflect weak links in production, quickly reflect production results, quickly summarize and promote advanced experience, quickly and steadily reform rules and regulations, quickly design, and quickly trial produce new products). The close interweaving and solid combination of professional management and mass management has played a huge role in production and work. Now, the processing of many tasks has achieved short time, high quality, and good results. For example, when the planning and finance section compiled the 1959 plan, because it did not adopt the method of combining professional personnel and the masses, fifty professional personnel compiled it for nearly a quarter and it was not accurate enough. When compiling the 1960 plan, the method of combining professional personnel and the masses, dividing the work, and unifying the balance was adopted. As a result, only fifteen professional personnel were used, and it was completed in four weeks. The close combination of professional management and mass management has greatly improved the work methods of the sections. Many people have learned to carry out economic work using political work and mass line methods, so that politics and economics, leadership and the masses, and theory and practice are fully combined.

50% of worker management has reached the professional level of professional personnel, and 35% of technical personnel have mastered the operating techniques of multiple types of work

The continuous consolidation, improvement, and development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system in the Qinghua Tool Factory has created a new situation in which everyone participates in management and everyone cares about production. Group management is well-organized, and the work of the sections has been renewed. With the comprehensive development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system, a working class team with high political awareness and a certain cultural and technical level and a cadre team that is both red and expert are growing. The factory now has 50% of worker administrators who have reached the professional level of similar professionals, and 35% of technical workers have mastered the operating techniques of multiple types of work. This year, the factory promoted 16 engineers from worker backgrounds, 8 factory-level cadres, and 118 workshop cadres. Due to the improvement of workers' management level and the mastery of certain production technologies by cadres through participation in labor and learning, this has created conditions for regular rotation of workers and cadres and gradual elimination of the differences between mental and physical labor.

Use the spirit of continuous revolution to continuously consolidate, improve, and develop the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" management system. The continuous consolidation, improvement, and development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system enables the relations of production to better adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces. Since 1958, this factory has been completing national plans month after month, quarter after quarter, and year after year. In particular, with the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," a large number of new technologies and new experiences have emerged, inventions and creations have emerged one after another, and the improvement of the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization has powerfully promoted the sustained leap forward of production, overcome the old "routine" of being loose in the front and tight in the back in production, and established and consolidated a new order of production steadily rising and continuously increasing. By June 25, the factory had completed half of the annual plan.

In implementing the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system, the Qinghua Tool Factory has unswervingly paid attention to continuous improvement and development. After learning from the experience of worker participation in management in the Jianhua Factory in 1958 and summarizing the experience of "Two Participations and One Reform," this factory also learned from the experience of "Three Combinations" in the Changchun Automobile Factory, forming the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system. Later, it learned from the experience of the Jiamusi Textile Factory's production sports meeting. In the situation of the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" and with the production sports meeting as the main form, in order to better adapt enterprise management to the needs of production development, in late February this year, a management work sports meeting with the theme of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" was held. This sports meeting alone matched all 4,420 individual experiences into 74 sets of advanced experiences in terms of experience matching, comprehensively improving and improving the level of enterprise management.

The new development of the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system in the Qinghua Tool Factory is a victory for strengthening Party leadership and launching mass movements on a large scale in enterprise management work under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past two years, in the process of consolidating, improving, and developing this system, the Qinghua Tool Factory has first strengthened Party leadership, adhered to putting politics in command, and resolutely carried out the struggle between two ideologies and two lines; from the ideological, organizational system, and work methods and work style, it has relatively thoroughly criticized and corrected the erroneous thoughts and practices of some cadres who were separated from Party leadership and separated from the masses. Therefore, it has further consolidated and developed the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system. Second, adhere to the policy of consolidation, improvement, and development, and comprehensively implement, improve, and develop the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system. Third, strengthen training work, comprehensively plan and comprehensively arrange workers' political, cultural, technical, and business studies, creating conditions for improving workers' management level. Fourth, taking production as the center, implement "quota-based cost accounting," combining adherence to the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system with labor competitions, powerfully promoting the sustained leap forward of production. Fifth, make appropriate adjustments and strengthen organizational institutions and systems, establish Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League groups with production groups as units, so that various organizational forms can adapt to the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations," ensuring the consolidation and development of this system. Sixth, regularly pay attention to the matching of advanced experiences, comprehensively summarize, and systematically promote, which has played a great role in comprehensively strengthening enterprise management and consolidating and developing the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system.

    不断提高政治觉悟　不断改进领导作风　把企业管理水平推向更高阶段
　　庆华“两参一改三结合”制度有重大发展
　　1958年以来生产节节上升月月季季年年完成国家计划
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江省庆华工具厂，根据不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的精神，坚持不渝地巩固、提高、发展“两参一改三结合”的制度，使这一制度在生产持续跃进的新形势下，有了重大发展。这一新发展，标志着企业管理工作进入了新的阶段。最近，中共黑龙江省委召开了现场会议，推广庆华工具厂发展“两参一改三结合”制度、全面提高企业管理水平的经验。
    “两参一改三结合”制度新发展的特点是：逐步扩大工人参加管理的范围，丰富管理的内容；科室干部学会用政治工作的方法进行经济工作；形成上下结合、纵横交错的企业管理网
    “两参一改三结合”制度，是庆华工具厂用学习和独创相结合的精神在1958年总结出来和开始推行的。两年多来，随着生产大跃进和技术革新、技术革命运动的猛烈发展，生产力的飞跃提高，庆华工具厂坚持并发展了“两参一改三结合”的制度，从而，比较全面系统地解决了企业管理工作上遇到的一些新问题。
    庆华工具厂“两参一改三结合”制度新发展的基本特点是：在不断提高工人的政治思想、管理业务和文化技术水平的基础上，逐步扩大工人参加管理的范围，丰富工人参加管理的内容，建立工人参加管理的秩序，提高工人参加管理的水平，使工人参加小组管理成为搞好企业各项管理工作的基础。同时，使科室干部明确地树立了面向生产，为生产服务的观点；学会用政治工作的方法进行经济工作，用大搞群众运动的方法开展管理工作。改革管理制度同改革管理工具相结合，改革专业管理业务同改革群众管理的业务相结合，破与立相结合的办法，不断地改革业务，不断地改进干部的工作作风和工作方法，建立工作、劳动和学习相结合的新的工作制度和新的工作方法。在群众管理日益巩固、专业管理日益加强的基础上，广泛运用三结合形式，把专业管理同群众管理紧密结合起来，形成一个严密的上下结合、纵横交错的企业管理网，使企业管理工作进入了新的阶段。
    管理工作越作越细，越管越全，越管越好；生产小组成了政治、经济、文化学习的主要活动场所
    庆华工具厂从1958年实行工人参加小组管理以来，工人们由开始管理小组的生产调度、原始记录、考勤、料具收发和保管等部分日常工作，发展到参加计划、技术、成本等全面管理。在计划管理上，由讨论执行计划、制订保证措施，发展到编制小组作业计划；这就使生产计划具有了更加广泛的群众基础，保证了计划的先进可靠性。在技术管理方面，工人已参加了质量分析、产品设计、新产品试制、修订工艺规程、处理合理化建议和参加高、大、精、尖、新产品的技术研究等工作，这就把技术理论同生产实践更好地结合起来了。由于工人参加小组管理的范围逐步扩大，这个厂在成本管理上，不仅能够进行班组经济核算，而且由按小组、按月进行核算，发展到按产品单件、按定额进行日核算、周分析、月总结，使核算、分析、监督三者密切结合起来，形成了人人都搞成本核算、个个关心经济效果的新局面。现在全厂工人对一滴油、一块破布、一个料头都算得很精心。二车间三八小组在副料使用上，采取了一系列措施，甚至一块破布都采取“用完洗、洗完用”的方法，仅1959年节约的费用就达一万五千多元，等于全组全年工资的二点七倍。广大职工这种兢兢业业勤俭办企业的优良作风，保证了全厂成本月月降低，可比产品成本1月份降低了1.52％，2月份降低了4.27％，3月份又降低了6.13％，4月份连续下降7.9％，5月份又降低了17.49％。小组管理范围的不断扩大，是和工人参加管理的人数越来越多，工人管理员水平不断提高密不可分的。庆华工具厂通过建立预备员制、师徒一职制、一职多员制等办法，使工人管理业务的水平正在不断提高，全厂90％以上的小组都管理得井然有序。据最近举行的全厂管理工作运动会测验评比的结果，全厂有50％的工人管理员达到了同类专业管理员的业务水平，有20％以上的工人管理员基本上可以胜任车间职能组长和车间主任的工作。随着工人管理员管理知识的不断丰富，全厂各小组都建立了比较完整的管理制度。如：四个簿（交接班记事簿、技术保安教育记事簿、合理化建议登记簿、会议记录簿），五本账（材料收发账、工具收发账、产品收发账、工时记录账、产品检验账），八个表（产品进度登记表、产品日报表、经济核算动态表等）和十一项管理制度，并通过班前班后会、周末经济活动分析会、月初计划落实和月终的总结评比等五个定期会议，作到了一天一检查、一周一分析，月初有计划、月末有总结，使小组管理工作越作越细，越管越全，越管越好。特别是以生产小组为单位成立了党、工会和共青团小组，在小组中以生产为中心，以党小组为核心，既抓生产和管理，又抓思想、抓学习、抓生活，这就不仅使生产小组真正成为企业一级坚强的行政组织和整个管理工作的基础，而且成为政治思想工作和技术文化学习的主要活动场所。
    全厂科级以上干部每年定期劳动一个月；一般干部每周劳动一天
      庆华工具厂干部参加劳动已作到计划化、制度化、经常化。两年来，全厂干部在坚持参加劳动方面已经把将军当兵、种试验田、轮流下放、跟班劳动、抓关键、现场办公、工人和干部定期轮换等定型、不定型和定期、不定期的劳动结合起来，把干部参加劳动与经常深入生产、领导生产结合起来。现在，全厂科级以上干部每年轮流到生产小组当工人一个月，一般科室干部每年集中两个月时间到小组当工人，车间干部每周固定参加两天劳动，参加生产领导生产。一般作到那里出现关键问题，那里就有领导干部参加劳动，他们以身作则，带领群众解决关键问题。因而，及时突破生产的薄弱环节，保证了生产的节节上升。据去年全年统计，干部在参加劳动中发现与解决的生产、技术、管理等问题七千八百多件。干部参加劳动，不仅及时解决生产中的问题，提高管理水平，而且逐步学会与掌握了生产技术知识。现在，全厂干部一般都能掌握一个以上的工种，三至五道工序的操作技术。五车间已有75％以上的干部和工人实行了定期轮换。
    由于工人参加管理范围的扩大，以及规章制度的改革、新式管理工具的出现，科室业务工作量大大减少，使干部有了更多的时间参加生产，深入实际。现在，科室干部普遍推行了“一劳三三制”（即科长以上干部每年定期参加劳动一个月，一般干部除每年劳动两个月外每周劳动一天，其他时间大体上处理业务、深入下去和学习各占三分之一）。这一制度的实行，对干部深入生产、坚持劳动和学习起了显著作用。据初步统计，科室干部深入现场办公的时间，约占工作时间的一半，就地解决的问题达到80％。全厂各级干部还分别与生产小组建立了固定联系点，经常深入，重点培养，作到同工人一条心，一股劲，一个样。因此工人们说：“干部劳动到车间，思想作风大转变，改进管理有起色，总结经验遍地传”。
    两年来，这个厂在规章制度方面进行了三次比较集中的带有全面性的改革。这种改革都是根据每个时期生产大发展的需要进行的。比如：1960年初进行的规章制度的第三次大改革，是在以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动的新形势下，在专业管理与群众管理密切结合的基础上进行的。这次改革的矛头首先是指向工艺规程和操作规程以及劳动组织和生产组织方面。这次改革共修改了工艺规程一千五百七十六项，占全厂工艺规程的84％。这次改革由于掌握了慎重从事，边破边立，破立结合的原则，做到了改得快，改得细，改得好，因而适应了生产持续跃进的需要。如计划财务科的凭单日记账，曾由三十二本减为二十六本，后来又减为七本；这次改革后，只留下一本账，从根本上改变了账目相互分割、重复计算的不合理现象，大大简化了财务手续，使账目更加合理，因而，结账人员由十二人减为三人，结账时间由十天减为四天，工作效率提高了十倍。此外，在核算、生产管理、技术管理等方面都创造出许多先进的工具。
    全厂按十个科室建立了十条专业管理和群众管理相结合的管理线，作到上动下随，下动上知，上下行动一致
    在“三结合”的运用方面，从形式到内容都有了新的发展。它不仅广泛运用在生产技术研究方面，而且广泛运用到管理工作的各个方面，突出的表现在专业管理与群众管理的密切结合上。现在全厂已经形成了一个由点到线，上下衔接，左右串联，紧密交织的管理网。在组织上、制度上摸出了一套结合、挂钩的方法。在车间有主任、专业人员和生产小组长的“三结合”作业会议，在科室有三级（科室、车间、小组）同业务会议，科室之间有协作会，联系会，“四结合”（生产、技术、检查、验收）会。全厂按十个科室，建立了十条专业管理和群众管理相结合的管理线。各科室按着业务系统与车间小组一串到底，开展“十线一网三结合”大联赛，作到了上下挂钩，环环相扣，上动下随，下动上知，上下行动一致，随时沟通情况，及时解决问题，形成了一套既保证工作质量又适应生产飞跃发展的“六快”的管理方法（快速反映生产薄弱环节、快速反映生产成果、快速总结配套和推广先进经验、快速而又稳妥地改革规章制度、快速设计、快速试制新产品）。专业管理与群众管理紧密交织，牢固结合，已在生产上、工作上发挥出巨大作用。现在，许多工作的处理，都达到了时间短，质量高，效果好。比如：计划财务科在编制1959年计划时，由于没有采取专业人员与群众相结合的方法，五十名专业人员编制了将近一个季度还不够准确。在编制1960年计划时，采取了专业人员与群众相结合，分口编制，统一平衡的方法，结果只用十五名专业人员，四周时间就编完了。专业管理和群众管理密切结合，使科室的工作方法有了很大改进和提高。很多人学会了用政治工作和群众路线的方法开展经济工作，使政治和经济，领导和群众，理论和实践全面地结合起来。
    50％的工人管理达到专业人员的业务水平，35％的技术人员，掌握了多工种的操作技术
    庆华工具厂“两参一改三结合”制度的不断巩固、提高、发展，使全厂出现了人人参加管理，个个关心生产的新局面。小组管理井然有序，科室工作面貌一新。随着“两参一改三结合”制度的全面发展，一支具有高度政治觉悟和具有一定文化、技术水平的工人阶级队伍和又红又专的干部队伍正在成长起来。这个厂现有50％的工人管理员达到了同类专业人员的业务水平，有35％的技术工人掌握了多工种的操作技术，今年全厂提拔了工人出身的工程师十六名，厂级干部八名，车间干部一百一十八名。由于工人管理水平的提高，干部通过参加劳动，学习掌握了一定的生产技术，这就为工人和干部定期轮换、逐步消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别创造了条件。
    用不断革命的精神，不断巩固、提高、发展“两参一改三结合”的管理制度“两参一改三结合”制度的不断巩固、提高和发展，使生产关系更好地适应生产力的发展需要。从1958年以来，这个厂一直是月月、季季、年年完成国家计划。特别是以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动的猛烈发展，新技术、新经验大量出现，发明创造层出不穷，机械化、半机械化水平的提高，有力地促进了生产的持续跃进，克服了生产上的前松后紧的旧“常规”，建立并巩固起生产步步高、节节上升的新秩序。到6月25日，全厂已完成全年计划的一半。
    庆华工具厂在贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”制度中，坚持不渝地注意不断提高和发展。这个厂从1958年学习了建华厂工人参加管理的经验，总结出“两参一改”的经验之后，又学习了长春汽车厂“三结合”的经验，形成了
  “两参一改三结合”的制度，后来又学习了佳木斯纺织厂生产运动会的经验，在以“四化”为中心，以生产运动会为主要形式的技术革新、技术革命运动蓬勃发展的形势下，为使企业管理工作更好地适应生产发展的需要，今年2月下旬，召开了以“两参一改三结合”为内容的管理工作运动会。这次运动会仅在经验配套方面就把全部四千四百二十项单项经验配成七十四套先进经验，全面地改进与提高了企业管理工作水平。
    庆华工具厂“两参一改三结合”制度的新发展，是在毛泽东思想的指导下，在企业管理工作上，加强党的领导和大搞群众运动的胜利。两年多来，庆华工具厂在巩固、提高、发展这一制度的过程中，首先加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚决地进行了两种思想、两条路线的斗争；从思想上，组织制度上以及工作方法和工作作风上，比较彻底地批判和纠正了部分干部中脱离党的领导、脱离群众的错误思想和作法。因而，进一步巩固与发展了“两参一改三结合”的制度。其次，坚持巩固、提高、发展的方针，全面贯彻、提高、发展“两参一改三结合”的制度。第三，加强培训工作，全面规划、全面安排工人的政治、文化、技术和业务的学习，为提高工人的管理水平创造了条件。第四，以生产为中心，推行了“定额化成本核算”，把坚持“两参一改三结合”制度与劳动竞赛结合起来，有力地促进了生产持续跃进。第五，从组织机构上、制度上进行适当调整和加强，以生产小组为单位建立了党、工会、共青团小组，使各种组织形式能与“两参一改三结合”相适应，保证这一制度的巩固和发展。第六，经常注意先进经验的配套成龙，全面总结，系统推广，对全面加强企业管理，巩固、发展“两参一改三结合”制度起了很大作用。
