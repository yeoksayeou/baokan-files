Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—The military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, on July 3rd dispatched military police to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese in Tjimahi, and created a bloody tragedy. Two overseas Chinese women were shot dead by soldiers, and two other overseas Chinese were injured. Several people were arrested.

On the morning of July 3rd, at 5:00 AM, the military authorities in West Java dispatched dozens of military police to forcibly relocate all overseas Chinese who had lived in Tjimahi for generations. The military authorities first cut off local external transportation and set up sentry posts everywhere. In order to force the overseas Chinese to relocate, armed military police actually opened fire on unarmed overseas Chinese women. Yang Mumei, the wife of overseas Chinese Lin Dunhua, was shot and died immediately. Yang Mumei was four months pregnant. Ye Jinniang, the wife of overseas Chinese Lin Yu, was shot seven times and lay on the ground crying for help. The military police forbade rescue, ordering that anyone who came forward to rescue her would be shot. After the overseas Chinese pleaded, the military police only allowed her to be taken to the hospital half an hour later. Ye Jinniang died on the way. At the same time, two other overseas Chinese were injured, and several overseas Chinese were arrested. At about 8:00 AM, in order to cover up the crime of murder, the local military police snatched Yang Mumei's body and washed away the brain matter and bloodstains on the ground with water. When the second batch of military police arrived at about 9:00 AM, the military police who caused the incident began to retreat to Bandung. They declared that it would be the same even if they killed a few more.

After Consul Mao Xinyu of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta learned of this bloody tragedy in Bandung, he immediately asked the military district authorities to conduct a joint investigation at the scene, but was unreasonably rejected.

The local overseas Chinese were extremely indignant at this massacre of innocent overseas Chinese. At 2:00 PM that day, more than 1,000 overseas Chinese, wearing black gauze armbands, led by the children of the deceased in mourning attire, went to the local military headquarters in batches to petition and sent representatives to the local military headquarters to lodge a serious protest, demanding severe punishment for the murderers, the release of the arrested overseas Chinese, the cessation of forced relocation, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again. At 3:00 PM, the local military authorities dispatched three tanks loaded with armed personnel to patrol Tjimahi, creating a terrifying atmosphere and intimidating and suppressing the overseas Chinese.

This bloody atrocity of the West Java military authorities in massacring overseas Chinese has aroused great indignation and unease among overseas Chinese throughout Indonesia, and has also deeply shocked Indonesian society. The Chinese Embassy has repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government regarding the second unreasonable forced relocation by the West Java military authorities, requesting them to abide by their promise not to force relocation and to immediately stop the forced relocation. Although Foreign Minister Subandrio stated when he met with Ambassador Huang Zhen on June 29th that he had sent Suska, Director of the Asia-Pacific Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Bandung to stop the forced relocation, the forced relocation activities in West Java have not stopped, but have become even more rampant, and have created the shocking bloody tragedy in Tjimahi. This is clearly instigated and supported by powerful groups in Indonesia.

### 在印度尼西亚有势力集团的策动和支持下  西爪哇军事当局制造屠杀华侨惨案

    在印度尼西亚有势力集团的策动和支持下
    西爪哇军事当局制造屠杀华侨惨案
    芝马圩两名华侨妇女被打死，两名华侨被打伤，数人被逮捕
    我驻雅加达总领事要求调查竟被拒绝，千余华侨向当地军部请愿提出严重抗议
    新华社4日讯　印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局于7月3日在芝马圩出动军警强迫华侨迁移，并且制造了流血惨案，两名华侨妇女被军人开枪打死，另两名华侨也被打伤。
    7月3日上午五时，西爪哇军事当局出动军警数十人强迫在芝马圩世代居住的全体华侨迁移。军事当局首先切断了当地的对外交通，到处设立岗哨。为了强迫华侨迁移，武装军警竟然对手无寸铁的华侨妇女开枪射击，华侨林敦华的妻子杨木妹中弹立即死亡，杨木妹腹中有四个月胎儿。华侨林玉的妻子叶金娘身中七弹，卧地呼救，军警不准救护，命令如谁上前救护就开枪。经华侨请求，半小时后军警才准许运往医院，叶金娘在途中死去。同时，还有两名华侨受伤，华侨数人被逮捕。八时许，当地军警为了掩盖杀人的罪迹，竟把杨木妹的尸体抢走，并且用水把地上的脑浆和血迹冲洗干净。九时许第二批军警到达时，肇事军警始撤回万隆，他们扬言，多打死几个，也是一样。
    中国驻雅加达总领事馆毛欣禹领事在万隆获悉这一流血惨案消息后，立即向军区当局提出共同到现场进行调查的要求，却被无理拒绝。
    当地华侨对这一屠杀无辜华侨的惨案极为愤慨。当天下午二时，有一千多名华侨臂带黑纱，由死者的儿女披麻戴孝领头，分批到当地军部请愿，并派代表向当地军部提出严重抗议，要求严惩凶手，释放被捕华侨，停止逼迁和保证不再发生类似事件。下午三时，当地军事当局又派三辆坦克，满载武装人员在芝马圩巡逻，制造恐怖气氛，对华侨进行威吓镇压。
    西爪哇军事当局这一屠杀华侨的血腥暴行，已经引起了印度尼西亚各地华侨极大的愤慨和不安，印度尼西亚社会人士也深为震动。中国大使馆曾就西爪哇军事当局第二次无理逼迁行动一再向印度尼西亚政府交涉，要求遵守不再迫迁的诺言，立即停止迫迁。尽管苏班德里约外长在6月29日同黄镇大使会见时，说明已派印度尼西亚外交部亚太司长苏斯卡到万隆停止迫迁，但西爪哇的迫迁行动并未停止，反而更加猖狂进行，并且制造了骇人听闻的芝马圩流血惨案，这显然是受到印度尼西亚有势力集团策动和支持的。
