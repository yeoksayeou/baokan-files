Improving the sanitary work of public canteens, nurseries and kindergartens is an important part of doing a good job in the collective life of the commune. Nearly 530 million people eat in public canteens across the country, and more than 50 million children live in nurseries and kindergartens. Now it has entered the hot summer season, which is a time when gastrointestinal infectious diseases, common summer diseases, and food poisoning are prone to occur. Grasping the two important checkpoints of "disease enters through the mouth" and preventing common diseases in young children is of particular importance for ensuring labor attendance and the health of young children.

So how can we do a good job in the sanitary work of public canteens, nurseries and kindergartens? The fundamental measure is to comprehensively and rapidly improve the sanitary knowledge of cooks and nursery staff. Because cooks and nursery staff are the main force in carrying out sanitary work in public canteens, nurseries and kindergartens, improving their sanitary knowledge means that sanitary work has a reliable guarantee through their efforts. Our team of cooks and nursery staff is very large. The main members of this team are housewives liberated from household labor. They have received the care and education of the Party, have high political enthusiasm, and a good spirit of learning, and have made great achievements in service undertakings. Many cooks and nursery staff have become the backbone of the mass sanitary movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and prevent diseases. However, because many of them still have a low level of education and lack sanitary knowledge, and many people have learned sanitary knowledge after taking on new jobs, there is still a big gap from the requirements of current collective life, and they cannot fully play their role on the sanitary front. Therefore, the sanitary knowledge training of cooks and nursery staff has become an extremely important task at present.

This important task before us has not been given enough attention by the responsible comrades of some Party committees and communes. They say that production and various tasks are busy, sanitary personnel are not easy to draw out, and it is difficult for cooks and nursery staff to squeeze out time to study, so it is difficult to arrange work in this area. As a result, this work has not been widely carried out in some places, and the effect is not significant. This is the main ideological obstacle to doing this work well. Production and work are busy, this is the actual situation. However, this is only one aspect of the matter. The other, and most important aspect of the matter, is that sanitary work is inextricably linked to production and other tasks. The busier production and various tasks are, the more necessary it is to popularize and improve the sanitary knowledge of cooks and nursery staff, do a good job in sanitary work, ensure everyone's health, and increase attendance. A large number of facts in various places have proved that canteens with good sanitary conditions also have good production; good sanitary work in nurseries and kindergartens ensures the healthy and lively growth of children, and also directly encourages the labor enthusiasm of their parents. For example, the Fahuasi Street Canteen in Chongwen District, Beijing, was established in March this year. The conditions were poor and the cooks lacked sanitary knowledge. However, after the cooks received sanitary knowledge training, they actively thought of ways to carry out sanitary technological innovations and did a good job in sanitary work, so that none of the eighty residents who ate there have suffered from gastrointestinal infectious diseases to this day, and no labor force has been absent from work due to illness. Another example is that more than 1,000 nurseries and kindergartens in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, have done a good job in sanitary work due to the county leaders' efforts to grasp the sanitary knowledge training of nursery staff, controlling the occurrence of various diseases, and enhancing physical fitness. The parents of the children saw their children grow up healthy and lively, and their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate of women increased sharply. For example, the child Hu Sujiao was originally malnourished, thin and sickly. After entering the nursery, she was carefully raised by the nursery staff who paid attention to hygiene, and soon grew up as healthy as other children. Her parents said gratefully: "The child is raised by the Party and the People's Commune, I will do a good job in production to repay the Party and the People's Commune!" Similar examples can be found everywhere. This fully demonstrates how closely related it is to do a good job in sanitary knowledge training for cooks and nursery staff, ensure the sanitary work of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, and develop production and cultivate healthy children. On the contrary, if the cooks and nursery staff lack sanitary knowledge, or if food poisoning, dysentery, etc. occur due to eating corrupt food, or if the cleaning and hygiene of the children is not paid enough attention, and infectious diseases occur, or because the sanitary work in other links is not done well, and diseases occur, it will not only damage the health of the labor force and children, but also directly affect production and various tasks. Therefore, it is precisely from the current and future production and the entire construction cause that we must strengthen the sanitary knowledge training of cooks and nursery staff, and we must not relax it because of certain difficulties. In fact, many places have combined production and work to carry out this work, and have created successful experiences.

The experience of many places proves that under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the cooperation of various relevant departments in training sanitary personnel, earnestly implement the policy of focusing on popularization, combining popularization and improvement, and adopting the method of simultaneously promoting comprehensive popularization, training key personnel, and running professional schools, various difficulties can be effectively overcome and the sanitary knowledge training work can be guaranteed to proceed comprehensively and rapidly. Comprehensive popularization means that every cook and nursery staff member in service should receive at least a basic sanitary knowledge education. In addition to general knowledge of personal hygiene, public hygiene, and environmental hygiene, every cook and nursery staff member should also have at least the most basic knowledge of food cooking and nutritional knowledge of staple and non-staple food combinations to ensure the safety and hygiene of the masses, and that they eat enough and eat well. Nursery staff should also have sanitary knowledge about childcare, learn to carry out sanitary propaganda and education for children, actively prevent and control the occurrence of infectious diseases, and strive to eliminate infectious diseases. In order to achieve these requirements, many places have adopted a variety of methods that do not hinder production and various tasks, and enable cooks and nursery staff to persist in learning and truly learn useful sanitary knowledge. For example, in cities, basic-level sanitary personnel are appointed as teachers, and spare time is used to adopt the forms of centralized classes, seminars, discussions, and organized radio lectures, supplemented by personal self-study; in rural areas, the form of decentralized learning is mainly adopted, supplemented by centralized classes and discussions, and basic-level sanitary personnel send sanitary knowledge to the door and provide on-site guidance; some cities and rural areas have also adopted methods such as teachers teaching apprentices, old teaching new, urban assisting rural areas, assigning areas to be responsible for, and setting up sanitary professionals to conduct regular guidance. These methods are all effective. In terms of improvement, in addition to running various sanitary professional schools to train nursing staff, etc., the most important thing at present is to train and cultivate the sanitary backbone of cooks and nursery staff. Many places have adopted the method of centralized training by the county, or centralized training by districts, recruiting people with a high school education level, political progress, good health, love for childcare, and practical work experience to conduct three-month sanitary knowledge training. The people who have undergone this kind of training can more comprehensively and systematically master general sanitary knowledge. After that, on this basis, through continuous spare-time learning, they will gradually understand some theoretical knowledge of nutritional hygiene, cooking, and children's physiology and disease care, and through teaching and improving in actual work, they will reach the level of intermediate sanitary personnel and nursery nurses. The general cooks and nursery staff can also quickly master sanitary professional knowledge through the teaching and driving of the backbone members.

The experience of many places also proves that sanitary personnel fully play their initiative and creativity, go deep into the masses, and work with cooks and nursery staff to adapt to local conditions and think of ways to overcome various difficulties and set up simple sanitary equipment. This is the key to the smooth development of sanitary knowledge training and the implementation of sanitary work. Imparting sanitary knowledge to cooks and nursery staff is a mass work. What is the sanitary knowledge level of cooks and nursery staff, and what do they urgently need? How to arrange study time according to their work situation? What is their acceptance ability, and what effective methods should be adopted? These questions are worth considering and solving properly. At the same time, the vast number of cooks and nursery staff have come up with many local methods to solve problems in order to do a good job in sanitary work. Especially in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, they have created more and more new creations such as local disinfection methods, local fans, and local tap water. In this case, in order to do a good job in sanitary knowledge training, it is very necessary for sanitary personnel to learn from cooks and nursery staff. Learn their creative spirit, and combine it with the sanitary knowledge in books to further summarize, improve, and promote it. In this way, the content of learning can be continuously enriched and the quality can be continuously improved.

Carrying out sanitary knowledge training in close combination with the current sanitary work, and promoting sanitary knowledge training by doing a good job in the current sanitary work, is also an important experience in many places in the past. At present, the sanitary work tasks of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens in various places are heavy. In order to adapt to the needs of the tasks, a series of issues such as sanitary knowledge training materials and teaching methods need to be arranged in a unified and good manner, and various effective measures should be taken to ensure that the current sanitary work is done well, and to ensure that everyone learns solidly through these practical work.

At present, on the basis of successfully completing the production tasks for the first half of this year, the people of the whole country are advancing victoriously, and are working selflessly to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the production tasks for the whole year and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. In order to ensure that the labor army is strong and vigorous, and that the enthusiasm is getting higher and higher, the Party committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the sanitary knowledge training of cooks and nursery staff while grasping production, and mobilize and organize the forces of relevant aspects to absorb the successful experience of various places. The sanitary department should act as an assistant to the Party committee, assist the Party committee in making plans for this work, and make proper arrangements in combination with the characteristics of production and seasons. Because the task of sanitary knowledge training for rural cooks and nursery staff is heavier than that in cities, the urban sanitary department should also regard it as one of the key tasks to support agriculture, so that the sanitary knowledge training in urban and rural areas can be fully launched, implemented step by step, and improved step by step, in order to do a good job in the sanitary work of the entire collective life.

    努力提高炊事员和保育员的卫生知识
　  搞好公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园的卫生工作，是搞好公社集体生活的重要一环。全国在公共食堂就餐的，有近五亿三千万人，在托儿所和幼儿园生活的有五千多万小孩。目前又已进入炎热的暑天，正是胃肠道传染病、夏季多发病以及食物中毒容易发生的时节，把住“病从口入”和防止幼儿多发病这两个重要关口，对于保证劳动出勤和幼儿的健康，更有特别重要的意义。
　　怎样才能做好公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园的卫生工作呢？根本的措施，就是要全面而快速地提高炊事员和保育员的卫生知识。因为炊事员和保育员是在公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园开展卫生工作的主力，提高他们的卫生知识，通过他们的努力，卫生工作就有了可靠的保证。我们的炊事员和保育员的队伍是很大的。这个队伍的主要成员，是由家务劳动中解放出来的家庭妇女。她们受到党的关怀和教育，政治热情高，学习精神好，在服务事业中已做出了巨大的成绩。许多炊事员和保育员已经成为除四害、讲卫生、预防疾病的群众卫生运动中的骨干。但是，由于她们中很多人的文化水平还低，卫生知识还缺乏，很多人走上了新的工作岗位以后，学到的卫生知识，离当前集体生活的要求，还有很大距离，还不能在卫生战线上充分发挥他们的作用，因之，炊事员和保育员卫生知识训练工作，就成为当前极其重要的一项工作。　　摆在我们眼前的这一重要工作，有的党委和公社的负责同志，还未能予以足够的重视。他们说生产和各项工作繁忙，卫生人员不易抽出来，炊事员和保育员很难挤出时间来学习，安排这方面工作有困难。以致有的地方对这一工作还没有普遍开展，成效不大。这是做好这一工作的主要思想阻碍。生产和工作忙，这是实际情况。但是，这仅是事情的一方面。事情的另一方面，也是最主要的一方面，是卫生工作与生产等各项工作有密不可分的内在联系，越是生产和各项工作忙，就越需要普及和提高炊事员和保育员的卫生知识，做好卫生工作，保证大家身体健康，提高出勤率。各地的大量事实证明，卫生搞得好的食堂，生产也就搞得好；托儿所和幼儿园的卫生工作搞得好，孩子健康活泼地成长，也直接鼓舞他们父母的劳动热情。例如，北京市崇文区法华寺街道食堂，从今年3月份开始建立，条件差，炊事员缺少卫生知识。但是炊事员经过了卫生知识训练以后，他们积极想办法，搞卫生技术革新，做好了卫生工作，就使在那里吃饭的八十名居民，直到现在无一人患胃肠道传染病，没有一个劳动力因病缺勤。又如，浙江省丽水县的一千多个托儿所和幼儿园，由于县领导上抓紧保育员卫生知识训练工作，做好了卫生工作，控制各种疾病的发生，并且，增强了体质。孩子们的父母看到孩子活泼健康地成长，生产热情空前高涨，妇女出勤率剧增。如托儿胡素娇原来营养不良，瘦弱多病，入托后，经过保育员讲究卫生的精心抚养，很快就长得和其他孩子一样健康。她的父母感激地说：“孩子是党和人民公社养活的，我要搞好生产报答党和公社！”类似以上的事例，在各地都有。这都充分地说明搞好炊事员和保育员卫生知识训练，保证做好公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作，与发展生产和培养身心健康的儿童具有何等密切的关系。相反，假如由于炊事员和保育员缺乏卫生知识，或因吃了腐败的食物，发生了食物中毒、痢疾等，或因对孩子的清洁卫生不够重视，闹了传染病，或因为在其他什么环节上的卫生工作没做好，发生了疾病，不但损害了劳动力和孩子的健康，而且必然直接影响生产和各项工作。因之，我们正是要从目前和将来的生产和整个建设事业着想，就越有必要加强炊事员和保育员卫生知识训练工作，绝不能因为遇到某些困难而放松了它。事实上，许多地方结合生产、结合工作地开展这方面的工作，已经创造出了成功经验。
　　许多地方的经验证明，在党委的统一领导下，在培养卫生人员方面，各有关部门协作，认真贯彻以普及为主、普及与提高相结合的方针，采取全面普及、训练骨干和开办专业学校等三头齐进的办法，就可以有效地克服各种困难，保证卫生知识训练工作全面而快速地进行。全面普及，就是要使每个在职炊事员和保育员都受到起码的卫生知识教育，每个炊事员和保育员，除去具备一般的个人卫生、公共卫生和环境卫生等知识以外，还要具备最起码的食物烹调和主副食搭配等营养知识，以保证群众安全卫生，吃得饱，吃得好；保育员还应当具备关于保育方面的卫生知识，学会对儿童进行卫生宣传教育，积极防止、控制传染病的发生，努力争取消灭传染病。为了达到这些要求，许多地方采取了多种多样办法，既不妨碍生产和各项工作，又能使炊事员和保育员坚持学习，真正学到有用的卫生知识。如在城市，由基层卫生人员任教师，利用业余时间，采取集中上课、座谈、讨论和组织广播讲座等形式，辅之以个人自修；在农村，采取以分散学习为主，集中上课、讨论等为辅的形式，由基层卫生人员把卫生知识送上门去，深入现场指导；有的城市和农村，还采用了师带徒、老带新、城市辅导乡村、分片包干，以及设有卫生专业人员，经常进行辅导等办法。这些办法都行之有效。在提高方面，除去兴办各种卫生专业学校，培养保育护士等以外，当前最主要的是训练培养炊事员和保育员的卫生骨干。许多地方采取由县集中，或是分片集中训练的办法，招收具有高小文化水平，政治进步，身体健康，热爱保育事业和有实际工作经验的人，进行为期三月的卫生知识训练。使经受这种训练的人，能够较全面而系统地掌握一般卫生知识，之后，在这一基础上，经过不断的业余学习，逐步懂得营养卫生、烹饪和儿童生理及疾病护理等一些理论知识，并通过在实际工作中的边传授、边提高，以达到中级卫生人员和保育护士的水平。而一般炊事员保育员通过骨干分子的传授和带动，也可以迅速地掌握卫生业务知识。　　许多地方的经验还证明，卫生人员充分发挥主动性和创造性，深入群众，和炊事员、保育员一道因时因地制宜，想办法克服各种困难，设置简易的卫生设备，这是卫生知识训练工作顺利开展、卫生工作得以贯彻的关键。向炊事员、保育员传授卫生知识，是一项群众工作。炊事员、保育员的卫生知识水平如何，迫切需要什么？怎样按照他们的工作情况来安排学习时间？他们的接受能力如何，应采取那些有效的办法？这些问题都值得考虑并加以妥善解决。同时，广大炊事员和保育员，为了做好卫生工作，他们已想出了许多土办法，很解决问题。特别是在技术革新和技术革命运动中，他们创造了土消毒法、土风扇、土自来水等等新创造越来越多。在这种情况下，为了把卫生知识训练工作搞好，卫生人员很有必要向炊事员和保育员学习。学习他们的创造精神，并结合书本上的卫生知识，进一步总结、提高和推广它。这样，就可使学习的内容不断丰富，质量不断提高。
　　和当前的卫生工作密切结合来开展卫生知识训练工作，又通过做好当前的卫生工作来带动卫生知识训练，这也是过去许多地方的一项重要经验。当前，各地公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园的卫生工作任务繁重，为了适应任务的需要，卫生知识训练的教材、教学方法等一系列问题，都需作统一的很好的安排，采取各项有效措施，既保证做好当前的各项卫生工作，又保证通过这些实际工作，使大家学得扎扎实实。
　　当前，全国人民在胜利完成今年上半年的生产任务的基础上，正乘胜前进，为保证完成和超额完成今年全年的生产任务，和提前实现全国农业发展纲要而忘我的劳动。为了保证劳动大军兵强马壮，干劲越鼓越足，各级党委领导上在抓生产的同时，必须加强对炊事员保育员卫生知识训练工作的领导，很好发动和组织有关方面的力量，吸取各地的成功经验。卫生部门要作好党委的助手，协助党委对这一工作做出规划，并结合生产和季节的特点，作妥善安排。而由于农村炊事员和保育员卫生知识训练工作任务比城市繁重，城市卫生部门还应该把它作为支援农业的重点工作之一，使城乡的卫生知识训练工作能够全面展开，着着落实，步步提高，以做好整个集体生活的卫生工作。
