Xinhua News Agency, July 1st. While frantically persecuting overseas Chinese for the second time, the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, are intensifying their persecution of overseas Chinese schools and destroying overseas Chinese education through barbaric means.

The military authorities in West Java forcibly requisition overseas Chinese school buildings under various pretexts, send special agents and rogue elements to monitor overseas Chinese schools, force overseas Chinese school principals to resign, and close overseas Chinese schools, causing schools to suspend classes, causing more and more school teachers and staff to lose their livelihoods, and causing more and more overseas Chinese teenagers and children to suffer the pain of dropping out of school.

Sadhari, the wartime power holder of the Cibaliung Regency in West Java, issued an order on June 20 to requisition the school buildings of Bandung Overseas Chinese Middle School to "accommodate" overseas Chinese who were forcibly relocated by the West Java military authorities. This order was extremely urgent, stipulating that the school buildings should be vacated on the 21st. This means that within one day, more than two thousand overseas Chinese students will be out of school, more than one hundred teachers and staff will be unemployed, and their legitimate rights to study and live will be deprived.

An official from the wartime power department of the Cibaliung Regency also revealed that when necessary, several overseas Chinese schools in Bandung will be suspended under the pretext of "accommodating" the forcibly relocated overseas Chinese. At present, the Bandung Overseas Chinese Public School has been ordered to stop handling student boarding. The authorities said that those who violate the order will be sanctioned by the military.

Another method of persecuting overseas Chinese education is to force overseas Chinese school principals and teachers to resign by means of "testing Indonesian." On June 8, a written notice was issued, citing "Regulation No. 1402 of 1957," using the excuse that they had not obtained an Indonesian diploma this year to force the principals of several overseas Chinese schools to resign before July 1. It is reported that the Surabaya Foreign Education Bureau also investigated the Indonesian examination status of principals and teachers in overseas Chinese schools. This is clearly an attempt to further persecute overseas Chinese schools through this regulation and continue to implement the anti-Chinese policy.

Indonesian overseas Chinese education circles pointed out that it is the legitimate right of overseas Chinese schools to use Chinese to teach overseas Chinese children, and foreign nationals in any country have the right to educate their children in their native language. They said that overseas Chinese school principals and teachers learn Indonesian based on the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Indonesian people, and the amount and speed of learning should depend on individual conditions, and should not be subject to unreasonable restrictions. They also said that overseas Chinese schools have always respected the legitimate policies and laws of the Indonesian government, and that the vast majority of principals are competent. They believe that the Indonesian Ministry of Education decided in July last year that from August 1961, only foreign teachers holding Indonesian examination diplomas would be allowed to teach in foreign schools, which is clearly an attempt to force many overseas Chinese school principals and teachers to resign and further destroy overseas Chinese education.

According to these sources, under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, the relevant authorities have adopted a series of restrictive and persecutory measures, resulting in the devastating destruction of overseas Chinese education. As a result, 72% of overseas Chinese schools have been forced to close, a large number of overseas Chinese students have dropped out of school, and teachers have lost their jobs, causing a fatal blow to the overseas Chinese education that overseas Chinese have painstakingly built for decades. In some places, unreasonable methods such as ordering overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools to stop enrolling first-year freshmen have even been adopted, planning to gradually and completely stifle overseas Chinese education within a few years.

### 封闭华侨学校　强征华侨校舍　迫使校长离职  西爪哇当局横暴摧残华侨教育

    封闭华侨学校　强征华侨校舍　迫使校长离职
    西爪哇当局横暴摧残华侨教育
    新华社1日讯　印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局在第二次疯狂地迫迁华侨的同时，采取蛮横手段加紧迫害华侨学校，摧残华侨教育。
    西爪哇军事当局假借各种名义强行征用华侨学校房屋，派遣特务和流氓分子监视华侨学校，强迫华侨学校校长离职，封闭华侨学校，使学校停课，使越来越多的学校教职人员丧失生计，越来越多的华侨青少年和儿童遭受失学的痛苦。
    西爪哇的西勃良安州战时掌权者沙达里6月20日下达命令，征用万隆华侨中学的校舍，作为“收容”被西爪哇军事当局迫迁的华侨之用。这道命令急如星火，竟规定21日就要把校舍腾出来。这意味着在一天之内就使二千多名华侨学生失学，一百多名教职员失业，剥夺他们的学习和生活的正当权利。
    西勃良安州战时掌权部的一个官员还透露，必要时要在“收容”被迫迁华侨的借口下，停办万隆的几所华侨学校。目前，万隆侨众学校已经被限令停止办理学生寄宿。有关当局说，违令者要受军方制裁。
    迫害华侨教育的另一种手段，是用“考试印度尼西亚文”的办法迫使华侨学校校长、教师离职。6月8日，发出书面通知，援引“1957年一四○二号条例”，以今年未取得印度尼西亚文文凭为借口，强迫几家华侨学校的校长在7月1日前离职。据悉，泗水外侨教育局也向华侨学校调查校长、教师的印度尼西亚文考试情况。这显然是企图通过这个条例进一步迫害华侨学校，继续贯彻排华政策。
    印度尼西亚华侨教育界人士指出，华侨学校用中文对华侨子女进行教学，是华侨的正当权益，任何国家的外国侨民都有权用祖国的语言教育自己的子女。他们说，华侨学校校长、教师学习印度尼西亚文是基于中国和印度尼西亚人民之间的友好关系和文化交流，学习的多少和快慢应看各人条件，而不应强加无理限制。他们还说，华侨学校一向尊重印度尼西亚政府正当的政策法令，而且绝大部分校长是称职的。他们认为，印度尼西亚教育部竟在去年7月决定，从1961年8月起，只有持有印度尼西亚文考试毕业文凭的外侨教师，才准许在外侨学校执教，这显然是企图用来强迫许多华侨学校的校长和教师离职，进一步摧残华侨教育。
    据这些人士透露，在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动下，有关当局采取一系列限制和迫害措施，对华侨教育事业横加摧残的结果，已使72％的华侨学校被迫停办，大批华侨学生失学，教师失业，使华侨几十年来苦心兴办华侨教育事业受到了致命打击。在有一些地方甚至已经采取了勒令华侨中、小学停止招收一年级新生等种种无理办法，计划在数年内逐步地完全扼杀华侨的教育事业。
