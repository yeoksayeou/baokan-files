Our Nanchang dispatch on the 6th: Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, adheres to the principle of agriculture as the key, and rationally arranges industrial and agricultural labor based on the ebb and flow of agricultural work. This has resolved the contradiction between the small labor force and large amount of land, the rapid development of steel production, and the shortage of labor, resulting in a double leap forward in both industry and agriculture.

In the first half of this year, although the county's labor force decreased compared to last year, the situation in industry and agriculture was excellent. On the agricultural front, not only was more than 80,000 mu of land cultivated, but also the field management of grain and cotton fields was very meticulous. The early rice seedlings were strong and robust, and the third-class seedlings were basically eliminated. Water conservancy construction projects and fertilizer production both doubled compared to last year. In the first agricultural evaluation competition among counties in the Ji'an Special District this year, it won the championship. On the industrial front, the county's steel production also took the lead, continuing to leap forward. The average utilization coefficient of the more than 30 newly built and renovated small blast furnaces was around 1.5. The pig iron output in the first three months of this year was more than the total pig iron output for the entire year of 1958. The qualified rate of pig iron reached more than 90%. Currently, a new high tide centered on doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting, and striving to promote the continued leap forward in steel production, is taking shape throughout the county.

Xingan County is an area with a small labor force and a large amount of land. The county's more than 500,000 mu of cultivated land has only more than 40,000 laborers. With the continued leap forward in industry and agriculture this year, especially with communes building small blast furnaces for iron smelting, the contradiction between industry and agriculture competing for labor has become increasingly prominent. In order to solve this problem, the Xingan County Party Committee, based on its years of experience in leading industrial and agricultural production, adopted a method of focusing on agriculture and flexibly arranging industrial and agricultural labor based on the changing patterns of agricultural work. This ensures that the focus is on the key points of industrial and agricultural production, so that the allocation of industrial and agricultural labor is rationally resolved.

Focusing on agriculture, fixing a group of professional industrial and agricultural teams, and adhering to regular production activities, is a prerequisite for Xingan County to allocate labor according to the busy and slack seasons of agricultural work. Without this prerequisite, production order would be disrupted. Based on the characteristics of agriculture—wide scope, many tasks, tight schedules, and heavy responsibilities—Xingan County fixed 75% of the county's labor force on the agricultural front to maintain regular production. They are the main force on the agricultural front, and they take the lead in carrying out crash programs during the busy farming season. The good field management of early rice after spring plowing and transplanting was carried out by this fixed labor force. Now that the summer harvest and planting is about to begin, this fixed labor force has launched preparations for harvesting and planting, such as accumulating fertilizer. In order to ensure a leap forward in steel production, 5% of the county's labor force was fixed on the steel front as a professional team for smelting and transportation, adhering to normal production.

Adopting the method of working in both industry and agriculture according to the busy and slack seasons of agricultural work, and alternating between the two to promote wave-like production upsurges in industry and agriculture, is an effective measure for Xingan County to rationally arrange industrial and agricultural labor. To this end, the party committees at all levels in Xingan County regularly control a mobile team of about 20% of the county's labor force, which serves as a fresh force for agriculture during the busy farming season and as a shock force to support steel production during the slack season. In the first half of this year, this group of people fought back and forth between industry and agriculture in three rounds. After agriculture completed spring plowing and transplanting, they immediately went to the steel front to build and renovate more than 30 small blast furnaces. After preparing enough fuel for a period of time, they withdrew to the agricultural front to participate in the battle to expand the cultivated area. After the county quickly completed the task of reclaiming 80,000 mu of wasteland, they were transferred to the steel base to create a high yield. When the field management of early rice urgently needed to strengthen the management of third-class seedlings, this labor force withdrew again to participate in the battle to accumulate, produce, and apply fertilizer, thoroughly eliminating third-class seedlings. Next, they rushed to the iron smelting front. Up to now, they have prepared enough fuel for the blast furnace for more than a month. Now, this force has launched preparations for the summer harvest and planting, centered on accumulating fertilizer.

When allocating labor according to the busy and slack seasons of agricultural activities, Xingan County strengthened organizational leadership. The Xingan County Party Committee considered that the seasonality of agricultural activities is very strong, and if nearly 10,000 mobile laborers are transferred back and forth, they will delay the agricultural season and be in a passive position if they are not grasped tightly. Therefore, they strengthened organizational leadership, implemented leadership by the secretary, and leaders went into battle, going up and down as they said, acting vigorously and swiftly, and racing against time. For example, when building furnaces and smelting iron on the steel front, the first secretaries at all levels of the county personally took command, and 17 county party committee members led teams into battle, and more than 170 cadres helped out. In one fell swoop, a large number of people were brought to the steel base; and when agriculture needed to expand the planting area, cadres at all levels immediately brought back more than 4,000 people from the mountains to participate in the battle within one day on June 17, greatly gaining time.

When arranging labor, Xingan County also particularly emphasized the combination of work and rest, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, reducing labor intensity, and improving labor efficiency. At the steel base, the efficiency has been doubled due to the innovation of a large number of transportation tools and operating tools. Now the labor force of a blast furnace has been reduced from more than 100 people to 50 people, and the workers' rest time is fully guaranteed. On the agricultural front, a large number of tools have also been innovated. For example, using a winch to plow fields can complete seven mu of harrowing tasks per person and per cow per day, which increases the efficiency eight times compared with harrowing with old-fashioned harrows. Now the county is promoting the remanufacturing of more than 200 rice transplanters, which are planned to be used for late rice transplanting.

    新干县坚持以农为主方针安排劳力
    有75％劳力经常从事农业劳动，农忙抽调机动力量参加突击
    本报南昌6日电　江西新干县坚持以农业为重点，依据农事忙闲合理安排工农业劳动力，解决了人少田多、钢铁生产发展快，劳动力不足的矛盾，获得工农业双双跃进。
    今年上半年，这个县劳动力虽然比去年减少，但工农业却出现了一派大好形势。在农业战线上，不仅扩种了八万多亩田地，而且粮、棉田间管理十分精细。早禾苗丘丘粗壮，基本消灭了三类苗。水利兴修工程与积肥造肥都比去年增加了一倍。在吉安专区各县今年第一次农业评比竞赛中，夺得了冠军。在工业战线上，这个县的钢铁生产也一马当先，持续跃进，新建、改建的三十多座小高炉，平均利用系数都在一点五左右。今年三个月的生铁产量，比1958年全年生铁产量总和还多。生铁合格率达90％以上。目前，一个以搞好夏收夏种为中心，力促钢铁生产继续跃进的新高潮又在全县形成。
    新干县是个劳动力少田地多的地区，全县五十多万亩耕地只有四万多个劳动力。随着今年工农业继续跃进，特别是社社大建炼铁小高炉，工农业互争劳动力的矛盾越来越突出。为了解决这一问题，中共新干县委根据多年来领导工农业生产的经验，采取了以农业为主，依据农事忙闲的变化规律灵活安排工农业劳动力的办法，把重点用到工农业生产的关头上去，使工农业劳动力的安排得到了合理的解决。
    以农业为重点，固定一批工农专业队伍，坚持经常性的生产活动，是新干县依据农事忙闲调配劳动力一个前提。没有这个前提，就会引起生产秩序的混乱。新干县根据农业面广、农事多、农时强、任务重的特点，把占全县劳动力75％的人，固定在农业战线上坚持经常性的生产。他们是农业战线上的主力军，在农忙时以它们为骨干，带头突击。今年春耕插秧后早稻的田间管理做得好，就是由固定的劳动力做主力担负起来的。现在夏收夏种快要开始，这批固定的劳动力又展开了积肥造肥等收种的准备工作。为确保钢铁生产跃进，在钢铁战线上也固定了占全县劳力5％的劳动力作为冶炼、运输的专业队伍，坚持正常生产。
    按照农事忙闲，采取亦工亦农的办法，来回突击，促进工农业掀起波浪式的生产高潮，是新干县合理安排工农业劳动力的一项有效措施。为此，新干县各级党委经常掌握着占全县劳动力20％左右的机动队伍，农忙时充作农业的生力军，农闲时又是支援钢铁生产的突击队。今年上半年，这批人马就在工农业之间来回大战了三个回合。在农业完成春耕插秧以后，立即开赴钢铁战线，新建、改建了三十多座小高炉，备足了一个时期的燃料以后，又撤回到农业战线，参加了扩大耕地面积的战斗。在全县迅速完成了八万亩的开荒任务以后，他们又调往钢铁基地，大闹高产。当早稻田间管理急需加强三类苗管理的时候，这批劳动力又撤回来，参加了积肥造肥施肥，彻底消灭三类苗的战斗。接着，又奔赴炼铁战线。到目前止，已经为高炉备足了一个多月的燃料。现在，这批力量又展开了以积肥为中心的夏收夏种准备工作。
    在按照农事活动忙闲调配劳动力时，新干县加强了组织领导。中共新干县委考虑到，农事活动的季节性很强，近万个机动劳动力调来调去，一不抓紧就会延误农时，处于被动。因此，加强了组织领导，实行书记挂帅，领导干部上阵，说上就上，说下就下，雷厉风行，争分夺秒。如钢铁战线上建炉炼铁时，全县各级第一书记亲自挂帅，十七个县委委员率队上阵，一百七十多个干部助战，一下子就把大批人马带上了钢铁基地；而在农业需要扩大下种面积时，各级干部又立即在6月17日一天时间内，从山上带回了四千多人投入战斗，大大赢得了时间。
    新干县在安排劳动力时，还特别强调了劳逸结合，大搞技术革新和技术革命，减轻劳动强度，提高劳动工效。在钢铁基地，由于革新了大批运输工具和操作工具，使工效成倍提高。现在一座高炉的劳动力已由一百多人减到五十人，而且充分保证了工人的休息时间。在农业战线上，也革新了大批工具，如用辘轴打田，一天一人一牛可完成七亩耙田任务，比用旧式耙去耙田提高工效八倍。现在全县又在推广改制二百多架插秧机，准备用到晚稻插秧上去。
