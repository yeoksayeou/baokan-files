　　The Qingdao Municipal Seawater Comprehensive Utilization Plant Preparatory Office recently manufactured a set of medium-sized seawater and barite comprehensive utilization equipment. Using this equipment, they have already produced nine products including bromine, magnesium carbonate, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, barium chloride, and sodium chloride.

　　After seawater is used to produce edible salt, there is still a large amount of residual bittern, the main components of which are magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, bromine, and many rare elements such as strontium, lithium, uranium, zirconium, and gallium. After the Party put forward the call to vigorously promote comprehensive utilization, in order to further develop the marine chemical industry and open up new resources for chemical industry raw materials, the Qingdao Municipal Chemical Industry Bureau organized forces to combine with local resource conditions to carry out more extensive comprehensive utilization of seawater, and independently designed and manufactured a set of seawater and barite comprehensive utilization equipment. Seawater and barite are both abundant resources in Qingdao. This transforms the past single production of magnesium carbonate, bromine, and various barium salt products using seawater, bittern, and barite as raw materials into comprehensive utilization. Initially, nine kinds of chemical raw materials such as bromine, potassium chloride, and barium chloride have been produced, which is of extremely important significance for the development of industrial and agricultural production. For example, crude potassium chloride can be used as fertilizer, and refined products can be used to manufacture various potassium compounds, such as potassium hydroxide, potassium chlorate, and potassium cyanide. Magnesium chloride is an important raw material for manufacturing refractory materials. Various magnesium alloys made from it can be widely used as parts for aircraft and aviation equipment, as well as materials for optical and precision instruments. Bromine is a raw material for the production of various bromide salts and organic bromides, and can be used as an anti-knock agent and to manufacture high-grade dyes, pesticides, and medicines. It can also be made into potassium bromide, sodium bromide, and ammonium bromide for use in film and photography production. Currently, the factory is still using this set of equipment to continue experimenting and produce more chemical products.

　　赶制成套设备　综合利用海水
    青岛市海水综合利用厂筹备处，最近制成一套中型的海水和重晶石综合利用设备，用这个设备已经生产出溴素、碳酸镁、氯化镁、氯化钾、氯化钡、氯化钠等九种产品。
    海水在制取食盐以后，还有大量的下脚苦卤，它的主要成分为氯化镁、氯化钾、氯化钠、溴素和锶、锂、铀、锆、镓等许多稀有元素。在党提出大搞综合利用的号召后，为了进一步发展海洋化学工业，开辟化学工业原料的新资源，青岛市化工局就组织力量结合当地资源条件，开展更广泛的海水综合利用，并自行设计制成了一套海水和重晶石综合利用设备。海水和重晶石，都是青岛市的丰富资源，这样把过去以海水、苦卤和重晶石为原料的单一生产碳酸镁、溴素及各种钡盐类产品，发展成为综合利用，初步已生产出溴素、氯化钾、氯化钡、氯化镁等九种化工原料，对发展工农业生产有极其重要的意义。如氯化钾，粗制品可作肥料，精制品可以制造各种钾化合物，如氢氧化钾、氯酸钾、氰化钾等。氯化镁，是制造耐火材料的重要原料，用它制成各种镁合金，可以广泛用作飞机和航空器械部件，以及光学、精密仪器的材料。溴素，是制取各种溴盐和有机溴化物的原料，可供作抗震剂和用来制造高级染料、农药、医药，并可制成溴化钾、溴化钠、溴化铵，供电影、照相制片应用。目前，这个厂还在运用这套设备，继续实验，制取更多的化工产品。
