Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: Summer hoeing and rice transplanting in Liaoning have accelerated greatly recently. The first hoeing of early fields has been generally completed, and about 30% have been hoeed a second time; the province's rice transplanting and sowing area has reached 2.7 million mu.

Recently, all regions have launched a summer agricultural production upsurge centered on "five搶 one防" ("five搶 one防" = "five grabs, one prevention").

The "five grabs" are: rush to hoe the first and second times to eliminate seedling shortages; rush to transplant rice seedlings, striving to transplant more, faster, and better; rush to plant late autumn crops to eliminate barren land; rush to transplant seedlings and replant to strive for full seedlings; rush to accumulate fertilizer and topdress to eliminate white fields. The "one prevention" is: prevent and resist natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, hail, insects, and diseases. During the upsurge, leaders at all levels left their offices to strengthen specific leadership on the front lines of production. In Jinzhou City, more than 5,300 cadres from the city, county, and commune levels went to the front lines of production to eat, live, and work with the commune members, participating in and leading production. After Xiao Chun, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, went to work in Heishan County, a key county of the Municipal Party Committee, and Suizhong County, which was experiencing drought, he successively held a summer hoeing production mobilization and martial arts competition attended by county party secretaries, commune party secretaries, and hoeing experts from the city in the fields, as well as a county party secretary field meeting. He conducted a major inspection, mobilization, and promotion, which promoted the rapid formation of an upsurge in summer hoeing production throughout the region. All dry land in the region has been hoeed for the first time, and about 40% has been hoeed a second time.

In order to accelerate the progress of summer hoeing and rice transplanting, all regions have reorganized the rural labor force, concentrating the main force to strengthen the main battle front. In Jinzhou City, the labor force participating in summer hoeing accounts for 70% of the city's agricultural labor force. At the same time, all regions have vigorously carried out tool reform, which has significantly improved efficiency. More than 160,000 pieces of semi-mechanized and improved cultivating and weeding tools have been promoted and used in summer hoeing throughout the province. Counties such as Fuxin, Kazuo, Gaiping, Yingkou, Fengcheng, and Haicheng have basically realized hoeing and weeding mechanization. In rice transplanting, more than 13,000 rice transplanters have been promoted and used throughout the province.

In order to support summer hoeing and rice transplanting, the mass movement of cities supporting rural areas is developing vigorously. According to incomplete statistics in Shenyang City, more than 120,000 teachers and students from universities and middle schools have gone to the countryside to support summer hoeing.

In accordance with the principles of equal exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, rural people's communes in various regions have widely launched large-scale cooperation, and have also used various forms such as field competitions, opponent competitions, and technical performance competitions to launch a lively summer production competition, which has also greatly accelerated the progress of summer hoeing and rice transplanting.

Xinhua News Agency: After overcoming the severe drought and successfully completing the summer planting work, Yunnan Province immediately launched an upsurge in field management work centered on summer hoeing. Currently, more than 2.1 million people are engaged in summer hoeing, and more than 12.1 million mu of mid-season rice and corn in the province have been hoeed for the first time.

According to the characteristics of many summer tasks, heavy tasks, and the strong seasonality of summer hoeing this year, all regions first concentrated their efforts to carry out a concentrated hoeing campaign on 20 million mu of large-area, high-yield fields, which are decisive for increasing production this year. In Lijiang Prefecture, about 70% of the agricultural labor force is currently engaged in the summer hoeing campaign. Each county and people's commune in Lincang Prefecture has launched a concentrated ten-day or concentrated week of summer hoeing, with a daily hoeing area of about 200,000 mu. The people's communes in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture seized the sunny days to rush to hoe corn, with a daily hoeing progress of more than 300,000 mu. Within less than a week after the end of sowing, the entire prefecture had hoeed all of the 800,000 mu of early-sown corn. In Xichou County, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, immediately after the end of planting, a mass cross-inspection was organized. The commune members of all ethnic groups were very enthusiastic about hoeing. Currently, all of the corn in the county has been hoeed once, of which 40% has been hoeed a second time; more than 30% of the mid-season rice has also been hoeed for the first time.

During the summer hoeing campaign, more than 70,000 cadres at all levels in the province went to the front lines of production, working side by side with the masses, helping communes, management areas, and production teams to improve labor organization, launch appraisals and competitions, and at the same time, grasp life and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. All regions in the province have implemented leadership cadres dividing the area to lead, organizing mass field surveys, formulating quality and progress requirements and acceptance systems, and launching high-efficiency and high-quality appraisal competitions between groups, teams, and people. Cadres at all levels in Yuanyang County adopted the method of going all the way to the end, with the first secretary of the Party Committee personally directing the hoeing, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences among the masses at any time, so that the progress of hoeing increased every day.

    发动群众开展田头评比　帮助公社合理组织劳动
    辽宁云南干部深入领导夏锄
    新华社沈阳讯　辽宁各地夏锄和水稻插秧进度最近大大加快。各地早田已普遍锄完一遍，并有30％左右锄了二遍；全省水稻插秧和播种面积已达二百七十万亩。
    各地最近都掀起了以“五抢一防”为中心的夏季农业生产高潮。
  “五抢”是：抢铲头遍和二遍，消灭苗荒；抢插秧，力争多插、快插、插好；抢种晚秋作物，消灭撩荒地；抢移苗、补种，力争全苗；抢积肥、追肥，消灭白茬地。“一防”是：防治和抗御水、旱、风、雹、虫、病等自然灾害。在高潮中，各级领导干部纷纷走出办公室，加强生产第一线的具体领导。锦州市市、县、公社三级就有五千三百多名干部深入生产第一线，与社员同吃同住同劳动，参加生产领导生产。市委第一书记萧纯深入到市委重点县黑山县和发生旱情的绥中县工作后，先后在田间召开了有全市县委书记、公社党委书记和铲趟能手参加的夏锄生产誓师比武大会和县委书记田头会议，进行大检查、大动员、大促进，推动全区夏锄生产迅速形成高潮。全区旱田已全部铲完头遍，40％左右已铲完二遍。
    为了加快夏锄和插秧的进度，各地都重新安排了农村劳动力，集中主要力量加强主攻战线。锦州市参加夏锄的劳动力，已占全市农业劳动力的70％。同时，各地大搞工具改革，使效率显著提高。全省在夏锄中推广使用的半机械化和改良的中耕除草工具达十六万多件，阜新、喀左、盖平、营口、凤城、海城等县基本上实现了铲趟耘锄化。在水田插秧中，全省推广使用的插秧机有一万三千多台。
    为了支援夏锄和插秧，各城市支援农村的群众运动正在风起云涌地向前发展。沈阳市据不完全统计，仅大、中学校下乡支援夏锄的师生就已经有十二万多人。
    各地农村人民公社根据等价交换互助互利的原则，广泛展开大协作，并且运用田间比武、对手赛、技术表演赛等多种形式，展开热火朝天的夏季生产竞赛，也促进了夏锄和插秧进度大大加快。
    据新华社讯　云南省在战胜严重干旱、胜利完成夏种工作后，又立即掀起了以中耕夏锄为中心的田间管理工作高潮。目前投入夏锄的有两百一十多万人，全省已有一千二百一十多万亩中稻和包谷薅锄过头遍。
    根据今年夏季活路多，任务重，中耕夏锄时令强等特点，各地首先集中力量突击薅锄对今年增产具有决定意义的两千万亩大面积高产田。丽江专区目前已有70％左右的农业劳力投入中耕夏锄运动。临沧专区各县和人民公社都开展了中耕夏锄的突击旬或突击周，每天薅锄面积达二十万亩左右。楚雄彝族自治州各人民公社乘晴天抢薅包谷，薅锄日进度在三十万亩以上，全州在结束播种后不到一星期，就将早种的八十多万亩包谷全部薅完了头道。文山僮族苗族自治州西畴县在栽种结束后，立即组织群众性的交叉大检查，各族社员薅锄劲头很大，目前全县包谷已薅锄一遍，其中40％薅锄了第二遍；30％以上的中稻也已薅锄过头遍。
    在中耕夏锄运动中，全省各级干部七万多人深入生产第一线，一面同群众并肩劳动，一面帮助各公社、管理区、生产队搞好劳动组织，展开评比竞赛，同时，抓好生活，注意劳逸结合。全省各地都实行领导干部划片分工领导，组织群众性的田间普查，制订质量、进度要求和验收制度，开展组与组、队与队、人与人之间的高工效、高质量评比竞赛。元阳县各级干部采取一竿子到底的方法，由党委第一书记亲自指挥中耕，随时在群众中总结和推广先进经验，使中耕进度天天上升。
