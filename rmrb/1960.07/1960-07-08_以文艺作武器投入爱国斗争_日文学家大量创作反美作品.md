Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: Amidst the storm of the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism, many famous Japanese writers have plunged into this great struggle with their literary weapons. With fiery language, they are creating a large number of works with the theme of opposing American imperialists and opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The famous old poet Tsuboi Shigeji's recently published poem entitled "A Call From Everyone Together" takes the opposition to the aggressive new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as its theme. The poet Toda Kaiko also created poems opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," such as "The Seal of Life, the Seal of Murder," as well as poems reflecting Japanese people's anti-American demonstrations, such as "The Procession." Oshima Hakko successively published passionate poems such as "The Motherland is Roaring" and "Always Shout: We Oppose!" in the "Akahata" newspaper. Ueno Nobuyuki, a poet from a coal miner background, wrote a poem entitled "May 20th" with angry passion, using poetic language to record the massive demonstration of hundreds of thousands of people against the Kishi Nobusuke group's violent manipulation of the House of Representatives of the Diet to "pass" the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on May 20th. These poems, to varying degrees, reflect the Japanese people's tenacious fighting spirit against imperialism and its running dogs, and the earth-shaking momentum of this struggle storm.

In terms of novels, some works with the theme of anti-imperialist struggle have also appeared recently.

Shimo Toseiji, the author of the novel "Okinawa Island," recently published a new book, "The People of Shurei." This is a sequel to "Okinawa Island." "Okinawa Island" was written by the author during a period when the people of Okinawa united to fight against the United States' attempt to separate Okinawa from Japan and against the United States' establishment of military bases in Okinawa. "The People of Shurei" further vividly reflects the Okinawan people's struggle against American imperialism.

    以文艺作武器投入爱国斗争
    日文学家大量创作反美作品
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：在日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴中，许多日本著名文学家纷纷以自己的文艺武器投入这一伟大的斗争。他们以烈火般的语言，创作大量主题为反对美帝国主义者，反对新日美“安全条约”的作品。
    著名老诗人壶井繁治最近发表的题为“所有的人一起呼吁”的诗篇，就是以反对侵略性的新日美“安全条约”为题材的。诗人杜田解子也创作了反对新日美“安全条约”的诗作“活命的图章、杀人的图章”，以及反映日本人民反美示威的诗歌“队伍”等。大岛博光在“赤旗报”上陆续发表了“祖国在怒吼”、“永远高呼：我们反对！”等热情的诗歌。煤矿工人出身的诗人上野信行，以愤怒的激情写了一首题为“5月20日”的诗篇，用诗的语言记下了十万群众反对岸信介集团5月20日用暴力操纵国会众议院“通过”日美“安全条约”的大示威。这些诗都在不同程度上反映了日本人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的顽强斗志和这个斗争风暴震撼天地的声势。
    在小说方面，最近时期也出现了一些以反帝斗争为主题的作品。
    长篇小说“冲绳岛”的作者、著名作家霜多正次，最近发表了一本新作“守礼之民”。这是“冲绳岛”的续篇。“冲绳岛”是作者在冲绳人民为了反对美国使冲绳脱离日本、反对美国在冲绳建立军事基地而一致起来斗争的时期写成的。“守礼之民”则进一步更生动地反映了冲绳人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
