    Reclaiming Wasteland, Developing Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Establishing Factories, and Building Modern Industry
    Xinjiang Production Corps Dedicated to Building Xinjiang
    Ten Years of Reclaiming 11 Million Mu of Wasteland, Producing 2.2 Billion Jin of Grain, and 1.22 Million Dan of Cotton
    (Our report) The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps is building the frontier of the motherland with unparalleled heroism. In the past ten years, on the desolate Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin, they have reclaimed over ten million mu of farmland with well-developed canal systems, built new towns and hundreds of factories, setting a glorious example for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in rapidly changing the poor and blank state of the border areas.
    The ancient Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin have an exceptionally arid climate and have relied on snowmelt from various mountain ranges for irrigation since ancient times. Over the past ten years, the production corps has built more than 110 large and medium-sized reservoirs and main canals in these areas, with a total length of nearly 10,000 kilometers, forming a vast irrigation network. It stores and diverts water from dozens of rivers, including the Manas, Tarim, Kaidu, and Ili, into the arid wilderness to irrigate farmland. The eight rivers in the Manas River reclamation area, after ten years of comprehensive management, have had nine large and medium-sized reservoirs and fifteen diversion canals built, with a total length of nearly 15,000 kilometers of irrigation network. The river water is now completely controlled. The river water has been diverted from the severely leaking and flooding old riverbeds, and all of it is artificially controlled, flowing obediently into the farmland through the irrigation network in a planned manner.
    While constructing water conservancy projects, the production corps has launched a large-scale land reclamation movement in the Gobi Desert, based on agricultural production, with grain as the key, diversified operations, and comprehensive development, establishing a network of farms. To date, 11 million mu of cultivated land with water conservancy facilities has been reclaimed. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the cultivated area will reach 15 million mu, close to the total sown area of all cultivated land in Xinjiang before liberation in 1949. On the reclaimed cultivated land, 182 large-scale mechanized agricultural (pastoral) farms with comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline development have now been built. This year, more than 9 million mu of various crops have been sown, 1.41 million pigs, sheep, horses, cattle, and other livestock have been raised, and tens of thousands of mu of farmland protection, beautification, and greening shelterbelts have been planted, transforming the previously extremely arid and uninhabited Gobi Desert into a network of farms with complete irrigation and drainage systems, road networks, shelterbelts, and land suitable for tractor cultivation, becoming a new type of agricultural production base. In the center of the farm network, such as Shihezi, Kuitun in the Junggar Basin, and Alar on the banks of the Tarim River, new cities with factories, schools, shops, hospitals, residences, and other buildings are being formed, becoming the economic and cultural center of the reclamation area.
    The corps farms have fully demonstrated the superiority of large-scale socialist production. From 1950 to 1959, the farms produced nearly 2.2 billion jin of grain, more than 1.22 million dan of cotton, and a large number of other agricultural, animal husbandry, and sideline products. In addition to self-sufficiency, they have accumulated a large amount of capital. The total amount of funds relying on production accumulation and reinvested in expanded reproduction is more than double the state investment (mainly in the early stage of production and construction), enabling the corps to have the strength to build large-scale projects and achieve agricultural mechanization with each passing year, maintaining a high-speed development of various productions. In 1958 and 1959, the reclaimed area exceeded the total of the previous eight years. A farm of more than 100,000 mu, from canal construction, land reclamation, building construction to putting into production, only took three or four months, shortening the time by eight or nine months compared to the past. The reclaimed area expected to be completed this year will exceed the total reclaimed area of the past ten years. The sown area and total output of grain and cotton will also be more than doubled compared to last year. The large canal on the south bank of the Ili River, which the corps started construction on this spring, is 170 kilometers long, with a designed flow rate of 150 cubic meters per second, crossing more than 80 mountain peaks, with an earthwork volume of more than 53 million cubic meters. It is currently the largest irrigation project in Xinjiang. After completion, half of the mighty Ili River water will be diverted, flowing through the new canal, increasing the irrigated area by more than 3.6 million mu, turning the vast grasslands on the south bank of the Ili River into farmland with gravity irrigation.
    The corps farms vigorously promote various advanced scientific cultivation techniques of mechanized farming, paving the way for the development of agricultural production in Xinjiang towards mechanized cultivation and scientific management. At present, the mechanization level of the main farm operations of plowing, harrowing, and sowing has reached more than 80%. The average labor productivity in 1959 was more than doubled compared to 1953. The average area of farmland managed per person has increased from about 20 mu in 1953 to 50 or 60 mu, becoming the unit with the highest level of agricultural mechanization in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In the continuous bumper harvests in the Manas reclamation area, the Ili reclamation area, and other places, several records of large-area high-yield cotton, corn, and wheat have also been created.
    While developing agriculture, the production and construction corps has also vigorously developed industry and transportation construction. In the early days of liberation, there was no modern industry in Xinjiang. One ton of steel and one bolt of cloth all relied on supplies from other regions. The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army accumulated construction funds by tightening their belts, built the first batch of modern factories, including 13 factories and mines such as steel mills, cotton textile mills, open-pit coal mines, and automobile repair and assembly plants. After 1952, all these factories and mines were transferred to the management of the local government, becoming the foundation and backbone for the development of modern industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Under the policy of developing raw material production and developing processing industry simultaneously, the production corps has successively built more than 300 factories for steel, coal, machinery, and tractor repair and assembly, textile, sugar, and various agricultural and animal husbandry product processing. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the Production and Construction Corps was equal to ten times that of 1953, becoming an important part of the industrial production of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

    开荒造田发展农牧生产　创办工厂建设现代工业
    新疆生产部队全力建设新疆
    十年来开垦荒地一千一百万亩　生产粮食二十二亿斤、棉花一百二十二万担
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团以无比的英雄气概建设祖国边疆。十年来，在万古荒原的准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地上，开垦出上千万亩渠系成网、阡陌相连的农田，建起一座座新兴城镇和几百个工厂，给新疆各族人民高速度改变边疆地区一穷二白的面貌作出了光辉的榜样。
    古老的准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地气候异常干旱，自古以来，就依靠各系高山融雪灌田。十年来，生产部队在这些地区修建了大中型水库、干渠等水利工程一百一十余项，干渠总长度近一万公里，建成了庞大的灌溉网，蓄引玛纳斯、塔里木、开都、伊犁等几十条河水，流入干旱的荒原灌溉农田。玛纳斯河垦区的八条河流，经过十年的综合治理，修建了九座大中型蓄水库，十五条引水渠和总长度将近一万五千公里的灌溉网，已经完全控制了河水，使河水从原来渗漏、泛滥严重的老河床改道，全部由人工控制，有计划地通过灌溉网驯服地流入农田里。
    在兴修水利的同时，生产部队在戈壁荒原上，开展了大规模的开荒造田运动，以农业生产为基础，以粮为纲，多种经营，全面发展，建立起星罗棋布的农场群。到目前为止，已经开垦出一千一百万亩有水利设施的耕地，预计到今年年底，耕地面积将达到一千五百万亩，接近解放前1949年新疆全部播种耕地面积的总和。在开垦出来的耕地上，现在已经建成了农、林、牧、副业全面发展的大型机械化农（牧）场一百八十二个，今年已经播种各种作物九百多万亩，饲养猪、羊、马、牛等家畜一百四十一万头，栽植的农田防护、美化、绿化等各种林带十几万亩，使原来异常干旱、荒无人烟的戈壁荒原上，出现了有完整的灌溉排水系统、公路网、林带和便于拖拉机耕作的土地连片的农场群，成为新型的农业生产基地。在农场群的中心，如准噶尔盆地的石河子、奎屯和塔里木河畔的阿拉尔等地，正在形成为工厂、学校、商店、医院、住宅等房屋连片的新型城市，成为垦区经济文化的中心。
    部队农场，充分发挥了社会主义大规模生产的优越性。从1950年到1959年，各农场共计生产粮食近二十二亿斤，棉花一百二十二万多担，以及其它大量农、牧、副业产品，除自给部分以外，还积累了大量资金。总计依靠生产积累又投入扩大再生产的资金，等于国家投资（主要是生产建设初期）的一倍多，使部队有力量与年俱增地修建大型工程和实现农业机械化，保持了各项生产高速度的发展。1958年和1959年，开荒面积就超过以前八年的总和，一个十几万亩的农场，从修渠、开荒、建筑房舍到投入生产，只用三、四个月，比过去缩短时间八、九个月。今年预计完成的开荒面积又将超过以往十年开荒的总和，播种面积、粮食和棉花总产量也都要比去年增加一倍以上。部队今年春季动工修建的伊犁河南岸大渠全长一百七十公里，设计流量为每秒一百五十立方米，越过八十多座山头、土石方工程达五千三百多万立方米，是新疆目前最大的灌溉工程，建成后将使浩浩荡荡的伊犁河水有一半改道，流经新渠，增加灌溉面积三百六十多万亩，使伊犁河南岸辽阔的草原全部成为自流灌溉的农田。
    部队农场大力推广机械化耕作的各种先进的科学栽培技术，为新疆农业生产向耕作机械化、管理科学化发展开辟了道路。目前，农场主要作业犁、耙、播的机械化水平已达到80％以上，1959年劳动生产率平均比1953年提高了一倍多。平均每人管理农田的面积，从1953年的二十亩左右提高到五、六十亩，成为新疆维吾尔自治区农业生产机械化水平最高的单位。在玛纳斯垦区、伊犁垦区等地连年获得大的丰收中，还创造了多项棉花、玉米、小麦大面积丰产或高额丰产纪录。
    在发展农业的同时，生产建设部队还大力发展工业和交通建设事业。解放初期，新疆地区没有什么现代化工业，一吨钢、一匹布，都依靠外区供应。人民解放军广大指战员节衣缩食积累建设资金，兴建起第一批现代化工厂，包括有钢铁厂、棉纺厂、露天煤矿、汽车修配厂等十三个厂矿，并在1952年以后，将这批厂矿全部移交给地方政府管理，成为新疆维吾尔自治区发展现代工业的基础和骨干。生产部队在发展原材料生产和发展加工工业同时并举的方针下，还陆续兴建起钢铁、煤炭、机械和拖拉机修配、纺织、制糖和各种农、牧业产品加工工厂等三百多个。1959年，生产建设兵团工业总产值已经等于1953年的十倍，成为新疆维吾尔自治区工业生产的重要组成部分。
