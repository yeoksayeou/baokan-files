    Value Lies in Selflessness
    Hu Xiongfei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CCP Tongcheng County Committee, Anhui
    What is the most valuable quality of a revolutionary hero? We say, it lies in selflessness.
    The reason why Huang Jiguang was able to use his twenty-year-old youthful life to pounce on the enemy's machine gun nest was because there was no "I" in his mind. Wang Guofan, the founder of the "poor stick" cooperative, which started with three donkey legs, was also able to raise the red flag of diligence and thrift higher and higher and never fade, precisely because he "did not seek fame or profit." Similarly, if Zhang Yulin, the Party Branch Secretary of Shuangxi Brigade, Kongcheng Commune, Tongcheng County, did not have the communist sparks of "stepping forward in the face of difficulties, and putting others before oneself when benefiting" shining in his mind at all times, how could he have gained the high trust of the members, closely united the broad masses around the Party, and exerted soaring enthusiasm, thus making a riverine hilly area prone to flooding and drought triple its grain output in four years, becoming a happy land of abundance? How could he be praised by the masses as "a good servant of the people, a confidant of the members," and be regarded by the Party as "a good example of revolutionary cadres"?
    Self-denial and altruism, and great public spirit, were originally the inherent qualities of the working people of our country. Under the nurturing of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, and after the tempering of the great revolutionary war and the great leap forward tide of socialist construction, this quality has risen to an unprecedented height and is radiating its splendid brilliance more and more strongly.
    Zhang Yulin does not have extraordinary abilities. Before liberation, he was an illiterate who could not read a single character, and he also had a disabled leg. The secret of Zhang Yulin's organization and leadership in making Shuangxi Brigade's production leap again and again is: to be wholeheartedly loyal to the Party and the people, to be completely selfless and dedicated to benefiting others in everything. Therefore, he deeply moved and educated the masses. The masses' discerning eyes saw that he was a highly trustworthy person, and believed that he was a "good head of the household" and a "confidant." Therefore, "the secretary walks in front, and the members follow closely," wherever the Party points, the masses rush. He is diligent and conscientious on weekdays, and selfless and fearless in times of crisis. He drags his disabled leg and does 140 to 150 workdays every year. When the river embankment breaks, he uses his disabled body to block the waves. He uses a big shovel to dig soil when pumping water for drought resistance... In the spring of 1958, he worked continuously for five days to save the frozen seedlings, so the members loved the seedlings as they loved their children, and every time they watched the seedlings, they kept their heads outside the shed, fearing that they would not know if it rained. He is honest and selfless, meticulous in his work, and regards public property as his life. For ten years, he has never misappropriated half a cent of public money. He even believes that the money that should be paid for travel subsidies is extra and has never received it. He always maintains the hard-working and simple nature of the working peasants, and always uses the words "starting a family is like picking soil with a needle" to warn himself and educate others. If the lamp head is too big when working at night, he will also twist it smaller. Is this a trivial matter? No, countless trivial matters have played a huge role. None of the cadres of Shuangxi Brigade have misappropriated public funds, the brigade's finances are as clear as water, the office expenses are saved every year, and the members invest every penny of their temporarily unused money in the brigade, calling it an "iron money cabinet" and a "safe." All of this is by no means accidental. However, Zhang Yulin is not stingy. He helps poor teams develop production, giving people if they need people, and giving money if they need money. He is truly selfless and altruistic. When water sources are tight during drought resistance, he lets the teams near the water use it, and leads the members to split mountains and open rivers to pump water from afar. He cares for people in all aspects and is wholeheartedly for the masses. Last year, when he went to Beijing to attend a meeting, he used all the money he had prepared to buy clothes for his wife and children to buy medicines for the members. He even gave his favorite bowl of glutinous rice to the old members who liked to eat glutinous rice. How could all of this be done without a selfless spirit? And how could all of this not touch people's hearts and excite people, and how could the members not be full of energy and double their energy when they work?
    Zhang Yulin's facts are very educational for us. Great public spirit is a clear sign of the communist worldview. Everything for the Party, everywhere for the masses, this is the most fundamental starting point for doing all work well. Only by starting from this point can we have a broad mind and liberate our thinking, can we be brave and tenacious, stand up and come forward, and can we overcome all difficulties and win every battle.
    "Completely selfless, dedicated to benefiting others," the spiritual characteristics of the working people of our country have become the new trend of the communist generation.

    贵在无私
    中共安徽桐城县委书记处书记　胡雄飞
    什么是革命英雄最可贵的品质？我们说，贵在无私。
    黄继光所以能用二十岁的青春生命，扑到敌人的机枪眼上，因为在他的思想上没有“我”字。三条驴腿起家的“穷棒子”社创始人王国藩，也正是因为他“一不为名、二不为利”，所以这面勤俭办社的红旗越举越高，永不褪色。同样的，桐城县孔城公社双溪大队党总支书记张玉林，如果不是思想上时刻闪耀着“遇难挺身而出，得利后己先人”的共产主义火花，怎能得到社员们的高度信赖，把广大群众紧紧地团结在党的周围，发挥冲天的干劲，从而使一个易淹易旱的沿河丘陵地带，四年之中粮食产量猛跳三倍，成为丰衣足食的幸福之乡呢？又怎能被群众赞之为“人民的好勤务员，社员的贴心人”，被党认为是“革命干部的好榜样”呢？
    克己为人，大公无私，原本是我国劳动人民素有的品质。这种品质在党和毛泽东思想阳光的抚育下，经过伟大的革命战争的烽火和社会主义建设大跃进浪潮的锻炼，已上升到空前未有的高度，愈来愈强烈地放射着它绚烂的光辉。
    张玉林并没有非凡的本领，解放前是一字不识的文盲，而且还残废了一条腿。张玉林组织领导双溪大队生产一跃再跃的秘诀是：对党、对人民，赤胆忠心，遇事毫不利己，专门利人。因此，深深感动和教育了群众。群众雪亮的眼睛，看出了他是极可信任的人物，认为他是“好当家的”，是“贴心人”，因此，“书记前头走，社员紧紧跟”，党指向哪里，群众便奔向哪里。他平日勤勤恳恳，紧要关头奋不顾身。他拖着一条残废的腿，每年都要做一百四、五十个劳动日，河堤决口，以自己残废的身躯挡浪头，抗旱车陡水，挖土使大锹……。1958年春，他连干五天，救活了冻坏的秧苗，所以社员们爱秧如爱子，每在看管秧田时，都把头露在棚子外边，生怕落雨不知道。他廉洁奉公，一丝不苟，对于公共财产，视若生命，十年来，从未挪用过公家半文钱，甚至连出差补助费这些应进的钱，都被他认为是分外的而从未领过。他始终保持劳动农民艰苦朴素的本色，时刻以“起家有如针挑土”的话，警惕自己和教育别人，夜里办公灯头大了，也顺手捻小些。这是小事么？不，无数小事发生了巨大的作用。双溪大队的干部没有一人挪用公款，大队财务一清如水，办公费用年年节余，社员们把每一文暂时不用的钱都投资到大队，称它是“铁钱柜”、“保险箱”。所有这一切，都决非偶然。然而张玉林并不吝啬，他帮助穷队发展生产，要人给人，要钱给钱，真正是克己为人。抗旱时水源紧张，他把近水让给穷队用，自己领着社员劈山开河，车远处水。他全面关心人，一心为群众。去年上北京开会，把准备给妻儿购买衣物的钱，全部给社员买了治病的药品；自己爱吃的一碗糯米饭，也送给喜欢吃糯米饭的老社员。凡此种种，没有无私的精神怎能办到？而这一切又怎能不感人心腑、使人激动，社员们干起活来又怎能不干劲冲天，精力倍增呢？
    张玉林的事实对我们很有教育意义。大公无私是共产主义人生观的鲜明标志。一切为了党，处处为群众，这是做好一切工作最根本的出发点。也只有从这点出发，才能心胸开阔，思想解放，才能勇敢顽强，挺身而出，才能排除万难，百战百捷。
    “毫不利己，专门利人”，我国劳动人民的精神特征，已经成为共产主义的一代新风。
