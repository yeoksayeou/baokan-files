    Overseas Chinese Diary
    A Happy Day
    (April 23rd)
    Today, my wife and I went to the tea garden to weed and fertilize. Fu Wen'er is strong and robust. He heard that the farm was building houses to accommodate new returned overseas Chinese and happily ran to dig the foundations and transport earth.

    When we arrived at the tea garden at 7:30 in the morning, old farm member Li Jinzuan was already there waiting for us. He came to help us with production techniques. He said: Today we are applying chemical fertilizer, which should be applied between the two tea trees. When applying, first dig a hole in the ground, put the appropriate chemical fertilizer in the hole, and then cover it with soil. He demonstrated it to us on the spot. We followed his method. With his patient help, we quickly learned.

    In the afternoon, we worked until three o'clock, and the leading comrades of the farm told us: Today is Saturday, and a cultural performance for the new returned overseas Chinese will be held in the evening, so everyone should go home early to prepare to watch the performance. In the evening, we had just finished dinner when our daughter, Mei Zhu, who is studying at Yongchun Overseas Chinese Middle School, also came home. Our daughter, Ding Mei, was especially happy today because she was invited to Beijing to attend the "May Day" celebrations. Everyone congratulated her. In the evening, the whole family happily went to the club to participate in the cultural evening. Fu Wen'er also danced the happiness dance at the meeting, and five-year-old Fu Qun also participated in the "People's Commune is Good" chorus. The whole family enjoyed themselves until late at night before returning to rest. This happy day made me unable to fall asleep for a long time after lying in bed. The past reappeared in my mind. I remembered the family's wandering life abroad, worrying about food and clothing all day long, and there was no guarantee for work and life. Now I don't have to worry about anything. I deeply feel how happy and warm it is to live in the socialist family of the motherland! The motherland is truly a strong backing for overseas Chinese.

    "Gratitude Money"
     (April 21st)
    April 21st was the most exciting and unforgettable day for me. In the evening, the motherland issued our first salary as new returned overseas Chinese participating in socialist construction. When I held the money in my hand, I was very excited and almost shed tears of gratitude. Back home, my mood couldn't calm down for a long time. Before returning to China, I made a living by helping people do small business in Indonesia. At the end of last year, I was banned from doing business, which left my family with no way out. At that time, someone said to me: "You have so many children, you will definitely have difficulties in living after returning." I knew that a family like mine would definitely starve to death if I returned to China before liberation, because I was forced to go abroad due to life reasons twenty-two years ago. But now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our family of ten has returned to the embrace of the motherland, and we have immediately received proper arrangements from the Party and the government. We have established a new family in Yongchun Overseas Chinese Tea and Fruit Farm, adults have jobs, children have schools to go to, four children are admitted to the farm's Overseas Chinese Elementary School for free, and two are admitted to Yongchun Overseas Chinese Middle School; our daughter who can play baseball was sent to the county to train in baseball. After we returned to China, the government was afraid that we would be cold, so they also issued ten cotton clothes and four cotton quilts to our family, making our family live a very happy and warm life. When my wife and I personally tasted the motherland's meticulous care, we couldn't help but shed tears of emotion more than once. Today, the government issued us wages again. I am really extremely excited. I think this money is not a salary but a sum of "gratitude money." Holding this "gratitude money" to the motherland, I express: I must more actively participate in labor and repay the great kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with practical actions.

    In the Tide of Technical Innovation
    (March 25th)
    The old material room in the factory is piled with scrap copper and rotten iron, but it has become a "treasure house," and people are digging into it, picking this and looking for that! They are searching like panning for gold. One worker picked some scrap car materials, hammered and hammered them, and successfully trial-produced a planer and saw machine. This machine improves work efficiency several times compared to manual work, which is really unexpected. These days, the old workers are overhauling machine parts and studying and improving repair tools. Their drilling spirit is really admirable. Our master, Huang Chengliang, only needs four hours to repair a badly damaged motor. I saw in him the spirit of the Chinese people who dare to think and dare to do in order to build socialism. Under the leadership and encouragement of the old workers, I also used my brains to find ways to invest in the technical innovation movement. In the past month, I have repaired more than twenty broken relays and five or six car generators. I heard that repairing a generator can save the country several hundred yuan, I am really happy, at least I have contributed a little to the construction of the motherland.

    归侨日记
    愉快的一天
    （4月23日）
    今天，我和妻子到茶园里除草施肥，福文儿身强力壮，他听说场里正在修建准备安置新归侨的房屋，高兴得跑去挖地基、运土。
    上午七点半钟到茶园时，老场员李金钻已经在那里等我们了。他是来帮助我们学生产技术的。他说：今天施化学肥料，应当施在两株茶树之间，施时要先在地下挖一个窟窿，把适当的化肥放在窟窿里，再把泥土盖上。他实地作给我们看。我们按照他教的方法作。在他的耐心帮助下，我们很快就学会了。
    下午劳动到三点钟，场里的领导同志就对我们说：今天是星期六，晚上要举行新归侨的文娱汇演大会，大家提早回家准备看汇演。傍晚，我们刚吃过晚饭，到永春华侨中学念书的梅珠女儿也回家来了。定妹女儿今天特别高兴，她被邀请赴北京参加“五一”节观礼。大家都给她道喜祝贺。晚上一家人欢欢喜喜到俱乐部参加文艺晚会，福文儿还在会上跳幸福舞，五岁的福群也参加了“人民公社好”的大合唱。全家人欢乐到深夜方回来休息。这一天的愉快生活，使我躺在床上久久不能入睡。往事又浮现在脑海中。想起在国外一家人的流浪生活，整天愁衣愁食，工作生活没有保障，现在什么都不用愁了。我深深感到生活在祖国的社会主义大家庭里是多么幸福和温暖！祖国真是华侨强有力的靠山。

    “恩情钱”
     （4月21日）
    四月二十一日，是我最兴奋也是难忘的一天。晚上，祖国发给我们新归侨回国参加社会主义建设的第一次工资。当我手上拿着钱，内心一直在激动着，感激得快要掉下眼泪来。回到家里，心情久久不能平静下来。回国之前，我在印度尼西亚帮人作小生意谋生，去年底被禁止营业，使我一家无路可走。当时，有人对我说：“你孩子这样多，回去生活一定会发生困难。”我知道，像我这样的家庭要是在解放前回国，就一定会饿死的，因为我就是在二十二年前迫于生活出国的。可是现在，在共产党的领导下，我们全家十口人回到祖国的怀抱，马上就得到党和政府的妥善安置。我们在永春华侨茶果场建立了新的家庭，大人有了工作，小孩有书读，四个子女免费进入场里的华侨小学念书，两个升入永春华侨中学念书；会打棒球的女儿被送到县里锻炼打棒球。我们回国后，政府怕我们受冷，还发给我一家人十件棉衣和四床棉被，使我一家人生活过得很幸福，很温暖。当我们夫妻亲身尝到祖国这种无微不至的关怀时，曾不只一次感动得流下热泪。今天政府又发了工资给我们。我心里真是兴奋极了。我认为这些钱不是工资而是一笔“恩情钱”。手拿这些“恩情钱”向祖国表示：我一定要更加积极地参加劳动，以实际行动来报答共产党和毛主席的大恩情。

    在技术革新浪潮中
    （3月25日）
    工厂里那个旧料间，堆的尽是一些破铜烂铁，但是它却成了“百宝库”，人们尽往里面钻，这个拣呀，那个找啊！就像掏金子一样地翻寻着。有一个工人，在里边拣了拣，拿了一些汽车废料，锤锤打打地试制成功一台刨锯机。这架机器比手工提高工效好几倍，真是出人意料之外。这几天，老工人们一面大修机件，一面钻研改进修配工具，他们那股钻劲真叫人佩服。我们的师傅黄成良，整修一个已经大坏的马达，只需要四个小时就行了。我在他身上看到了祖国人民为了建设社会主义而表现的敢想敢干的风格。在老工人们的带动鼓舞下，我也动脑筋想办法投入技术革新运动。一个月来，修好二十多个断电器和五、六个汽车发电机。听说修一个发电机可为国家节约资金几百元，我真高兴，总算我对祖国建设贡献了一点力量。
