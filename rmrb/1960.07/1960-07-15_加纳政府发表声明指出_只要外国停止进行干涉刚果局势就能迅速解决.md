Xinhua News Agency, Accra, July 13th: The Ghanaian government issued a statement on July 13th regarding the situation in the Republic of Congo, stating that any interference in Congo by other countries "will be regarded by the Ghanaian government as an unfriendly act and an act of aggression."

　　The statement indicated that the Ghanaian government takes a very serious view of attempts to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Congo. It said, "The Ghanaian government recognizes Katanga as an integral part of the Republic of Congo, and any attempt to separate Katanga from the Congo is a serious violation of the territorial integrity of the Congo."

　　The statement condemned the words of a colonel in the Belgian army commanding forces in Elisabethville as "an ultra vires interference in the affairs of an independent country." This colonial officer openly stated that his troops would support the separatist movement.

　　The statement also said that the Ghanaian government views the matter with even greater seriousness since the secessionists of Katanga Province have appealed to the British colonial authorities of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to send troops to Congo. The statement condemned the prime minister of this federation for clamoring in a statement that "the federal government reserves the right to use force to do anything that is favorable to it."

　　The statement said, "The Ghanaian government wishes to make it clear that it in no way recognizes the right of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to interfere in the affairs of an independent African country, militarily or otherwise." It said, "If any Commonwealth country appears to be actively involved in interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic of Congo, the Ghanaian government will consider this an unfriendly act."

　　The statement added, "Ghana believes that the current difficulties in the Congo should be resolved primarily through the efforts of independent African countries in the United Nations. The Ghanaian government believes that interference by countries outside Africa will not ease tensions, but will only exacerbate them."

　　The statement pointed out, "As long as hostile foreign countries do not interfere for their own special interests, the current situation in the Congo has the potential to be resolved peacefully and quickly."

　　The statement stated that the Ghanaian government is willing to provide various forms of assistance to Congo, including military assistance. The statement said, "If the Congolese government makes a request directly or through the United Nations, the Ghanaian government is prepared to immediately send troops to Leopoldville or other places in the Republic of Congo."

　　It is reported that a Ghanaian delegation led by Jean of the Ghanaian Bureau of African Affairs has arrived in Leopoldville and held several talks with the Congolese government on the 13th. Ghana's Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Major General Alexander, will also arrive in Congo on the morning of the 14th.

　　加纳政府发表声明指出
　　只要外国停止进行干涉刚果局势就能迅速解决
    新华社阿克拉13日电　加纳政府13日就刚果共和国的局势发表声明说，任何其他国家对刚果的干涉“将被加纳政府认为是不友好的行动和侵略行动”。
    声明表示，加纳政府对于想要破坏刚果共和国领土完整的企图抱有非常严重的看法。它说，“加纳政府承认加丹加是刚果共和国的不可分割的一部分，任何想使加丹加脱离刚果的企图是对刚果领土完整的严重侵犯。”
    声明谴责指挥伊利沙伯维尔的比利时军队的上校所说的话“是越权干涉一个独立国家的事务的话”。这名殖民军官公然要以他的军队支持分裂主义运动。
    这项声明还说，自从加丹加省的分裂分子呼吁罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦的英国殖民当局派遣军队到刚果去以来，加纳政府对于这一事件有更为严重的看法。声明谴责这个联邦的总理在一项声明中叫嚣说“联邦政府保留利用武力做出任何有利于它的事的权利”。
    声明说，“加纳政府希望清楚地表明，它绝不承认罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦有权利在军事或其他方面对一个非洲的独立国家的事务进行干涉”。它说，“如果，任何英联邦国家看来积极参与干涉刚果共和国内政的行动，加纳政府将认为这是不友好的行动”。
    声明又说，“加纳认为，刚果目前的困难首先要通过非洲独立国家在联合国内所作的努力来解决。加纳政府认为，非洲以外的国家的干涉不会缓和紧张局势，只会加剧紧张局势。”
    声明指出，“只要敌对的外国不为它们自己的特殊利益进行干涉，目前刚果的局势有可能得到和平和迅速的解决。”
    声明表示加纳政府愿向刚果提供包括军事援助的各种援助。声明说，“如果刚果政府直接或通过联合国提出要求的话，加纳政府准备立即派军队到利奥波德维尔或刚果共和国的其它地方去”。
    据报道，由加纳非洲事务局的吉恩率领的一个加纳代表团已经到达利奥波德维尔，并在13日同刚果政府举行了多次会谈。加纳国防部参谋长亚历山大少将也将在14日上午到达刚果。
