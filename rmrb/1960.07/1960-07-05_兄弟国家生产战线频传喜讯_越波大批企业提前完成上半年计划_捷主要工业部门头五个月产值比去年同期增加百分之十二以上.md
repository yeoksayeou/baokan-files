　　In addition, good news of increased production has also been reported from the non-ferrous metals, machine manufacturing, and chemical industries.

　　An important reason for the significant achievements made by various industrial sectors in completing production plans in the first half of this year is the implementation of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party on carrying out technological innovation, adjusting production organization and labor quotas, and greatly improving labor productivity.
