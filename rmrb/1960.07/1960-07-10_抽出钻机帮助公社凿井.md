    Extraction Rigs Help Communes Dig Wells
    The Shanxi Provincial Geological Bureau vigorously supports agricultural drought resistance. Since March, it has transferred twenty-six drilling rigs to ten counties (cities), including Xinding, Yuci, Pingyao, Wenshui, Linfen, Hongdong, Yuncheng, Yuanqu, Yangcheng, and Jincheng, to help people's communes dig wells. As of June 25th, they had drilled ninety-nine boreholes, including forty-nine artesian wells, with a daily water yield of 191,750 tons, capable of irrigating more than 36,000 mu of land. The vast number of geological exploration personnel regard supporting agriculture as their glorious political task. With the lofty ambition of subduing dragons and tigers, they have brought their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity into full play in their labor, and under the scorching sun, they have joined the broad masses of farmers in launching a great battle to extract grain from underground water. When casing pipes were insufficient, they used bamboo pipes, wooden pipes, porcelain pipes, and concrete pipes as substitutes. During the exploration, they also adopted a combination of hydrogeological and geophysical methods according to the needs of farmland irrigation and the possibility of underground water occurrence, thus greatly accelerating the exploration speed.
    The vigor of the geological exploration personnel has greatly inspired the drought resistance enthusiasm of the commune members. They vowed to redouble their efforts to overcome the drought and win a bumper harvest to thank the working-class elder brothers.

    抽出钻机帮助公社凿井
    山西省地质厅大力支援农业抗旱，从3月间起，已抽调了二十六台钻机，分赴忻定、榆次、平遥、文水、临汾、洪洞、运城、垣曲、阳城、晋城等十个县（市），帮助人民公社凿井。到6月25日，他们已钻了九十九个钻孔，其中自流井有四十九眼，涌水量一昼夜达十九万一千七百五十吨，可浇地三万六千多亩。广大地质勘探人员把支援农业作为自己的光荣政治任务。他们怀着降龙伏虎的雄心壮志，在劳动中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，在烈日照射下和广大农民一起，展开向地下水要粮食的大战。套管不足，他们就采用竹管、木管、瓷管、洋灰管等来代替。在勘探中，他们还根据农田灌溉的需要和地下含水的可能，采用水文地质和物探相结合的方法，因此大大地加快了勘探的速度。
    地质勘探人员的干劲极大地鼓舞了公社社员的抗旱热情。他们誓以加倍的干劲，战胜干旱，夺得丰收，来感谢工人老大哥。
