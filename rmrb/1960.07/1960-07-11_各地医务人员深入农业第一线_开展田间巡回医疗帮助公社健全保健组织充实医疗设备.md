Xinhua News Agency report: Healthcare departments in various regions are actively supporting agriculture, improving rural healthcare levels, and promoting a leap forward in agricultural production.

Currently, many urban medical and health institutions have established comprehensive collaborative relationships with rural grassroots health units. In Wuhan, sixteen hospitals have successively partnered with hospitals in five prefectures, four cities, twenty-five counties, and five people's communes in the past six months. Various regions have adopted methods such as reciprocal exchange, advanced studies, sending people down to mentor, and running on-site training classes to actively impart technology and cultivate health cadres for rural areas. In Hefei, twenty-four hospitals and medical colleges have sent more than 300 medical personnel to the medical and health units of more than 70 rural people's communes to provide technical guidance. Last year, they trained more than 500 intermediate and primary medical and health personnel for rural areas. Recently, they have also helped counties and communes to open two intermediate and primary health schools and eight short-term training courses, with a total of more than 500 students. In Shanxi Province's Jincheng County, more than 500 doctors were transferred to twelve communes to train more than 20,000 health workers and hygienists in batches and phases. On average, there is one health worker or hygienist for every eleven laborers in the county. The health workers and hygienists follow the production army to work, prevent and control diseases, and promote health knowledge. More than 3,600 field amateur health schools have been established throughout the county, with more than 350,000 members participating in the study.

Organizing medical personnel to go deep into rural areas and conduct field mobile medical services is one of the effective ways to support agricultural production that is often adopted in various regions. According to preliminary statistics from seven cities in Liaoning Province, twenty medical teams (groups) have been organized to conduct mobile treatment in rural areas this year. In Shandong Province, nearly 120,000 medical personnel have formed more than 10,000 mobile medical teams (groups) and rushed to the front line of production. In Guan County, in addition to organizing 365 mobile groups to the fields, medical units also set up 145 first-aid stations in the fields to provide immediate diagnosis and treatment. In order to adapt to the needs of agricultural bumper harvest squares and square fields, the health department of Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, moved the grassroots medical institutions to the bumper harvest squares, established fixed treatment rooms in 10,000-mu squares, mobile medical teams in 1,000-mu squares, and health workers in 100-mu squares, forming a strict health care line, effectively supporting the high-yield movement of agriculture.

In terms of medical equipment, various regions have also given strong support to rural areas. The Shenyang Municipal Health Department supported 92 people's commune hospitals with nearly 300 pieces of medical equipment, helping them to quickly establish laboratories, operating rooms, and delivery rooms. Beijing Tongren Hospital helped Daxing District Hospital build four new departments: ophthalmology, tuberculosis, pediatrics, and radiology, and added equipment such as X-ray machines, universal operating beds, and ambulances.

With the strong support of urban health departments, the medical and health organizations and medical equipment in the vast rural areas have been further improved, and the professional level of medical personnel has been greatly improved. Many county and commune hospitals can perform more complicated operations, which not only saves the country transfer costs and other expenses, but also facilitates patients' access to medical treatment. According to statistics from Huangpi County Hospital in Wuhan, the number of patients transferred to Wuhan for treatment reached more than 100 last year and the year before, while only five patients were transferred in the first half of this year; many operations that could not be performed in the past can now be performed. In the first half of this year, 284 operations were performed successively, with a cure rate of 99%, and the course of treatment was shortened by one-half.

In the process of vigorously supporting agriculture, urban health departments have also improved their political and ideological levels and professional skills. The broad masses of medical personnel have been tempered in going to the countryside, strengthened their mass viewpoint and labor viewpoint, and improved their ideological awareness. Medical units and medical colleges have enriched teaching content and promoted scientific research in supporting agriculture.

　　各地医务人员深入农业第一线
　　开展田间巡回医疗帮助公社健全保健组织充实医疗设备
    据新华社讯　各地卫生部门积极支援农业，提高了农村医疗水平，促进了农业生产的跃进。
    目前，许多城市医疗卫生机构已经和农村基层卫生单位挂钩，建立了全面的协作关系。武汉市十六所医院半年来先后和五个专署、四个市、二十五个县和五个人民公社的医院挂钩。各地采取对口交换、上来进修、下去带徒弟和就地开办训练班等方式，积极传授技术，为农村培养卫生干部。合肥市二十四个医院和医学院校派出三百多名医务人员到七十多个农村人民公社的医疗卫生单位，进行技术指导。去年他们为农村培养出五百多名中、初级医药卫生人员，最近，又帮助各县、公社开办中、初级卫生学校两所、短期训练班八班，共有学员五百多名。山西晋城县抽调五百多名医生，分赴十二个公社，分批分期地训练了两万多名保健员和卫生员，全县平均十一个劳动力就有一个保健员或卫生员。保健员和卫生员跟随生产大军劳动，防治疾病并宣传卫生知识，全县已经建立三千六百多个田间业余卫生学校，参加学习的社员达三十五万多人。
    组织医务人员深入农村、田间巡回医疗，是各地经常采用的支援农业生产的有效方式之一。根据辽宁省七个市的初步统计，今年已组织二十个医疗队（组）到农村巡回治疗。山东省已有近十二万名医务人员组成一万多个巡回医疗队（组）奔赴生产第一线。冠县医疗单位除组织三百六十五个巡回组到田间外，还在地头上设立一百四十五个急救站，做到随到随诊。为适应农业丰产方和方田化的需要，河北省藁城县卫生部门把基层医疗机构搬到丰产方，在万亩方建立固定治疗室，千亩方设流动医疗队，百亩方设保健员，组成一条严密的卫生保健线，有效地支援了农业的高产运动。
    在医疗器械设备方面，各地也给农村以大力支援。沈阳市卫生部门把近三百台医疗设备支援了九十二个人民公社医院，帮助他们迅速建立化验室、手术室、分娩室等。北京同仁医院帮助大兴区医院新建了眼、结核、小儿、放射等四个科室，增添了X光机、万能手术床和急救车等设备。
    在城市卫生部门的大力支援下，广大农村的医疗保健组织和医疗设备进一步健全起来，医务人员的业务水平有了很大提高。许多县、公社医院都可做较为复杂的手术，既为国家节省了转院费用等开支，又方便了病人就医治病。据武汉市黄陂县医院统计，去年和前年转院到武汉市内治病的患者达到百余人，而今年上半年转院的只有五人；过去很多不能做的手术现在都可以做了，今年上半年先后施行手术二百八十四例，治愈率达99％，而且缩短疗程二分之一的时间。
    城市卫生部门在大力支援农业的过程中，也提高了自己的政治思想水平和业务水平。广大医务人员在下乡中受到了锻炼，加强了群众观点、劳动观点，提高了思想觉悟。医疗单位、医学院校在支援农业中丰富了教学内容、促进了科学研究工作。
