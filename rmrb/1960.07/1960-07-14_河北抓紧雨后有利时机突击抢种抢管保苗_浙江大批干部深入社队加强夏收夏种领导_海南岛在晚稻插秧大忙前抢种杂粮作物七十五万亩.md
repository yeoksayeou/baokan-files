Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th July: Some areas of Hebei Province received rain between June 20th and July 6th. In some of these areas the drought situation was alleviated, and in others it was eased. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on July 6th with the participation of the secretaries of various municipal committees, demanding that the entire party and all the people be mobilized urgently and go all out to launch a crash planting, crash management, drought resistance planting and drought resistance seedling protection campaign. With ten days of intense effort, they should complete the crash planting and weeding tasks. All localities immediately took action. In the Baoding area, more than 1.2 million people were put into the crash planting and management campaign. More than 5,000 secretaries of party organizations at all levels and more than 30,000 cadres in this area worked with commune members in the fields. The labor force engaged in planting summer potatoes in Tang County increased from 90,000 at the beginning of July to 110,000, and the daily progress of planting soared from 4,000 mu to more than 11,000 mu. Areas that had not received soaking rain also launched a heatwave of seizing the moisture for planting. Some communes in Zunhua County took advantage of the moisture to spot-water and rush to plant summer potatoes, planting more than 3,400 mu on the 7th alone. So far, the province has completed more than 76% of its summer planting plan.

Prior to June 20th, Hebei had been experiencing drought. In order to combat the drought and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn, the people's communes in various localities, in accordance with the call of the Provincial Party Committee, while concentrating their efforts on managing the 40 million mu of irrigated high-yield fields, also strived to expand the sown area and launched a movement to fight drought and expand planting to achieve more harvests. By the beginning of July, intercropping and interplanting had been implemented on 35 million mu of spring and summer crops throughout the province, and various crops had been expanded by more than 6.9 million mu by utilizing wasteland and idle land.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th July: The season of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice is approaching in Zhejiang Province. Party and government leading organs at all levels throughout the province, in accordance with the spirit of taking grain as the key link and agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, are strengthening leadership in the preparation of summer harvesting and planting work in all aspects, striving to achieve timely harvesting of early rice, careful harvesting and threshing, high yields and bumper harvests, and ensuring the area, season and quality of late rice.

The characteristics of early rice harvesting and late rice transplanting in Zhejiang this year are large area, heavy tasks, tight season and high requirements. The harvesting area of early rice and the transplanting area of late rice in the province have increased by more than 20% compared with last year. At the same time, the density of early rice planting is higher than last year, and the growth is better than last year; late rice transplanting also requires high standards and high quality. All this makes this year's harvesting and planting workload much greater than last year, and these farm works are concentrated within more than ten days, so the labor force appears particularly tight. Therefore, doing a good job in harvesting early rice and planting late rice has become an important key to striving for a continuous great leap forward in grain production this year. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee recently instructed party and government leading organs at all levels and organizations at all levels of the people's communes to strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, go all out, do everything possible to ensure that more than 80% of the labor force is put into the main attack front.

At present, the leading departments at the provincial level and the organs of various special districts and counties are seriously discussing how to support the summer harvest and summer planting with the greatest strength. Various localities have successively transferred a large number of cadres to communes and teams. The provincial organs have transferred more than 1,500 cadres to key counties and communes, and more than 10,000 cadres have been transferred to backward production teams to help them do a good job in summer harvesting and summer planting. Leading cadres in various counties of the Jinhua Special District have generally gone deep into the production teams. More than 70,000 cadres in the Ningbo Special District work and live with commune members, and take the lead in using and promoting various new harvesting and planting tools.

In the preparation of harvesting and planting, party committees at all levels have prominently strengthened the leadership in the manufacturing, promotion and use of new agricultural tools and agricultural machinery. Under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, industrial, commercial, scientific and cultural departments throughout the province vigorously support agricultural technological transformation, so that the preparation of harvesting and planting tools centered on rice transplanters has been done earlier, better, larger in quantity and higher in quality than in any previous year. The province has currently manufactured and promoted more than 120,000 rice transplanters, and a large number of harvesting, threshing, plowing, harrowing, transportation and other tools have also been transported to the countryside. More than 400,000 rice transplanter operators and new agricultural tool operators have been trained. Various localities are continuing to vigorously grasp technical training, establish a strong technical team for using new tools, and strive to universally use new tools such as large sickles, rapid harvesters, and rice threshers for early rice, and basically realize machine transplanting for late rice.

While promoting the use of various new tools, many counties and communes in Wenzhou, Jinhua, Ningbo, Jiaxing and other special districts have comprehensively ranked the labor force according to the requirements of more than 80% of the labor force being put into the main attack front, and tried their best to put the labor force on the front line. Jiaxing, Anji, Yuyao and other counties are taking measures such as digging, squeezing, refining, exchanging, reducing, and returning to mobilize and replace more than 50,000 laborers from living welfare, commune-run industrial and other departments to enrich the rush harvesting and planting team.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th July: People's communes in various parts of Hainan Island are taking advantage of the abundant rainwater and the free time before the busy season of late rice transplanting to vigorously expand the planting of high-yield coarse grain crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, and millet. At present, more than 750,000 mu have been sown throughout the island.

Under the guidance of the idea of ​​giving equal importance to staple grains and coarse grains, Hainan Island has planted particularly many and particularly early coarse grain crops this year. 1958 was a year when more summer coarse grains were planted here, but at that time only 400,000 mu were planted in the entire region after the "Great Heat", while this year, although the previous period was threatened by severe drought, the people's communes resisted drought and rushed to plant, and the planting speed was about twice as fast as in previous years. Ledong, Danxian, Dongfang and other counties that were most severely affected by the drought tried every means to resist drought and expand planting, and respectively completed and overfulfilled the summer planting plan for coarse grains by the end of last month. At present, while continuing to expand planting, various localities have organized professional teams to strengthen the management of coarse grain crops. Many areas with faster expansion progress have begun to carry out secondary weeding, soil cultivation and topdressing.

    新华社天津13日讯　河北省部分地区在6月20日到7月6日之间先后得雨，得雨地区有些地方解除了旱象，其他地方旱情也有所缓和。中共河北省委在7月6日召开了有各市委书记参加的电话会议，要求全党全民紧急动员，全力以赴，展开抢种抢管和抗旱点种抗旱保苗大突击，大干十天，完成抢种抢锄任务。各地立即行动起来，保定地区有一百二十多万人投入了抢种抢管突击运动。这个地区的五千多名各级党组织的书记和三万多名干部，同社员一道在田间突击。唐县投入夏薯插秧的劳力，由7月初的九万人增加到十一万人，插秧日进度由四千亩猛增到一万一千多亩。没有下透雨的地区，也掀起了借墒抢种的热潮。遵化县有些公社借墒点水，抢栽夏薯，7日一天就栽了三千四百多亩。到目前止，全省夏种计划已完成76％以上。
    6月20日以前，河北各地一直干旱。为了战胜干旱，力争秋季丰收，各地人民公社根据省委的号召，在集中力量抓好四千万亩保浇丰产田的同时，都努力扩大播种面积，开展了一个抗旱抢种广种多收的运动。到7月上旬，全省已有三千五百万亩播种的春夏作物地实行了间作套种，各地还利用荒地和闲散土地扩种各种作物六百九十多万亩。
    新华社杭州13日电　浙江省紧张繁忙的收割早稻和插种晚稻季节即将到来，全省各级党政领导机关根据以粮为纲、农业为国民经济基础的精神，从各方面加强对夏收夏种准备工作的领导，力争做到早稻适时收割，细收细打，丰产丰收，晚稻达到保面积、保季节、保质量的要求。
    浙江省今年收割早稻和插种晚稻的特点是面积大、任务重、季节紧、要求高。全省早稻收获和晚稻插种面积都比去年扩大20％以上。同时早稻密植程度比去年高，生长比去年好；晚稻插种也要求高标准高质量。这一切使今年收、种工作量比去年大大增加，而且这些农活又集中在十多天内完成，劳力显得特别紧张。因此，今年收好早稻种好晚稻就成为争取今年粮食生产持续大跃进的重要关键。中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会最近指示全省各级党政领导机关和人民公社各级组织加强领导，充分调动广大群众的积极性，全力以赴，千方百计，保证有80％以上的劳力投入主攻战线。
    目前，省级各领导部门和各专区、县机关都在认真讨论如何以最大的力量支援夏收夏种。各地相继抽调大批干部深入社、队。省级机关已抽调一千五百多名干部到各重点县、社，还抽调一万多名干部深入到落后生产队，帮助他们搞好夏收夏种。金华专区各县领导干部已普遍深入到生产队。宁波专区七万多名干部和社员一起劳动一起生活，并带头使用和推广了各种新式收种工具。
    在收种准备工作中，各级党委都突出地加强新式农具、农业机械的制造、推广和使用的领导。全省各工业、商业和科学文化部门，在以农业为基础的思想指导下，大力支援农业技术改造，使以插秧机为中心的收、种工具准备比过去任何一年都做得早、做得好、数量大、质量高。全省目前已制造和推广插秧机十二万多部，还有大量的收割、脱粒、耕耙、运输等工具也已运到农村。训练插秧机手和新农具手四十万多人。各地正在继续大抓技术训练，建立强大的使用新工具技术队伍，争取早稻普遍使用大镰刀、快速收割器、打稻机等新工具，晚稻基本上实现机插。
    在推广使用各种新式工具的同时，温州、金华、宁波、嘉兴等专区许多县、公社根据80％以上劳力投入主攻战线的要求，对劳动力进行全面排队，尽量把劳力放到第一线。嘉兴、安吉、余姚等县正在采取挖、挤、精、换、减、归等办法，从生活福利、社办工业等部门动员和换出五万多个劳动力，充实抢收抢种队伍。
    新华社广州13日讯　海南岛各地人民公社乘雨水充沛和晚造插秧大忙前的空闲时机，大力扩种番薯、玉米、高粱、粟类等高产杂粮作物。目前全岛已经播种七十五万多亩。
    在主粮和杂粮并举的思想指导下，今年海南岛各地对杂粮作物种得特别多，特别早。1958年是这里夏种杂粮比较多的一年，但当时在“大暑”后全区仅种下四十万亩，而今年虽然前一个时期受到严重干旱的威胁，但各人民公社抗旱抢种，种植速度却比往年快一倍左右。受旱最重的乐东、儋县、东方等县，想尽一切办法抗旱扩种，在上月底就分别完成和超额完成了杂粮夏种计划。目前，各地在继续扩种的同时，已组织专业队伍，加强杂粮作物管理。许多扩种进度较快的地区，已开始进行第二次除草、培土和追肥。
