Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: Tokyo dispatch: Three thousand workers from various industries in Tokyo held a rally and demonstration in front of the National Railway Corporation building today, demanding that the authorities withdraw their plans to punish national railway workers who participated in the patriotic struggle against the US-Japan military alliance.

    The workers sent thirty representatives to the National Railway authorities and the Ministry of Transport to present their demands.

    Meanwhile, about eight hundred postal and telecommunications workers held a rally in front of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation this morning, protesting against the authorities' conspiracy to punish workers who participated in the struggle against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." They also sent twenty representatives to the vice president of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation to deliver a letter of protest. The letter stated that if the company punishes the workers, they will launch a forceful struggle to fight back against the suppression.

    Today, six hundred postal and telecommunications workers and five hundred government employees also held rallies and demonstrations in front of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry buildings, strongly demanding the withdrawal of the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan to punish workers.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: Two more local assemblies in Japan have demanded the dissolution of the Diet. According to today's "Asahi Shimbun" report, the Kashiwazaki City Assembly in Niigata Prefecture passed a resolution at its meeting on the 2nd, demanding the dissolution of the Diet. The resolution stated that the Kishi Nobusuke group, starting with the revision of the "Security Treaty," has had a negative impact on people's lives. The government must dissolve the Diet and listen to public opinion.

    Prior to this, the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly had passed a resolution at its meeting on the 1st, demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Kawashima Shojiro, revealed on the 2nd that the Liberal Democratic Party has decided to elect a new prime minister in the Diet before the 13th, and then recommend the new prime minister as the new president of the party at the Liberal Democratic Party convention to be held on the 13th, in order to replace Kishi Nobusuke, who has long been notorious.

    The Liberal Democratic Party has always first elected a president within the party, and then the president comes forward to form a cabinet and serve as prime minister. The reason for reversing this practice this time is that Kishi Nobusuke is conspiring to take advantage of the opportunity of his clinging to power to first decide on the candidate for the next prime minister who is "agreeable" to him, in order to control and influence the next cabinet to continue to implement the US-Japan military alliance policy, and avoid electing a president who is "not agreeable" to him at the Liberal Democratic Party convention in the future.

    Since Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his "determination to resign" on June 23, he has been using the contradictions within the party, adopting a combination of suppression and wooing tactics against the "middle-of-the-road faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction," in an attempt to continue to control the party. Kishi Nobusuke has indicated to Ikeda Hayato, Ohno Banboku, and Ishii Mitsujiro of the "middle-of-the-road faction" that whoever agrees to his three conditions, he will recommend as the next prime minister. His three conditions are: strengthening the new "Security Treaty" system; purging "dissenters" within the party who take a critical attitude towards the new "Security Treaty"; and strengthening "public security" policies. At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke declared that he would "rectify the party" and expel Kono Ichiro and Miki Takeo and others of the "anti-mainstream faction."

    Kishi Nobusuke's actions have made the struggle for power and profit within the Liberal Democratic Party even more lively. Ikeda, Ohno, and Ishii, who have been hinted by Kishi Nobusuke that they have hopes of succeeding as the next prime minister, are stepping up their activities.

    Former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru is running around for Ikeda. According to "Yomiuri Shimbun," Yoshida Shigeru met with Ishii on June 24, asking him to give up the idea of becoming the next prime minister. Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) Radio said that in order to recommend Ikeda as prime minister, Yoshida Shigeru will conduct "vigorous work" on Kishi Nobusuke and other "mainstream factions."

    Ohno and Ishii expressed their desire to unite against Ikeda Hayato and expressed their dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke. Ohno pointed out when he met with Kishi Nobusuke today that the moves of the "mainstream faction" would affect the selection of the next prime minister and would cause a crisis in the conservative party. Ohno demanded that the "mainstream faction" clarify who it wants to support, and expressed that it would unite with Ishii to counter. Following this, members of the Ohno faction and the Ishii faction held a liaison meeting to study the issue of strengthening joint action.

    Kishi Nobusuke is precisely trying to exploit the contradictions between the Ikeda and Ohno/Ishii groups in an attempt to profit from them. Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) Radio pointed out on the 2nd that the Ikeda faction has six or seventy members in both houses of the Diet, the Ohno faction has five or sixty members, and the Ishii faction has at most forty-five members. This roughly equal situation is "an opportunity to be taken" for the "mainstream faction" with a majority of Kishi and Sato.

    Kono Ichiro and Miki Takeo and others of the "anti-mainstream faction," who are regarded by the Kishi Nobusuke group as targets of "party rectification," expressed their intention to fight back against Kishi Nobusuke.

    The Kono faction issued a statement on the 2nd, strongly criticizing Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to exclude the "anti-mainstream faction" and interfere with the policy and organization of the next cabinet. The statement condemned the "mainstream faction's" attempt to expel the "anti-mainstream faction" and expressed that this conspiracy could not be allowed to succeed. The statement said that the "Shunju Kai" (Kono faction organization) will actively launch resolute actions.

    News reports said that the Kono faction also decided to convene another meeting on the 5th to discuss the specific attitude to be taken against the "mainstream faction" in the future.

    According to today's "Tokyo Shimbun" report, representatives of the Miki-Matsumura faction and the Ishibashi faction held a meeting with representatives of the Kono faction on the 2nd and decided to support the Kono faction's statement.

    News reports said that due to the more intense factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party, it is still difficult to predict who will be elected president at the Liberal Democratic Party convention scheduled for the 13th, and whether the election method will be recommendation or competition.

    东京工人示威反对政府镇压阴谋
    日本又有两个地方议会要求解散国会
    岸信介集团阴谋利用执政党内部矛盾控制下届内阁
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：东京各行业的三千名工人今天在国营铁道公司大厦前面举行大会和示威游行，要求当局撤销处罚参加反对日美军事同盟爱国斗争的国营铁道工人的计划。
    工人们派遣三十名代表向国营铁道当局和运输省分别提出了他们的要求。
    同时，约八百名邮电工人今天上午到电信电话公司前面举行大会，抗议当局阴谋处罚参加反对新日美“安全条约”斗争的工人。他们并且派二十名代表向电信电话公司副总裁递交了抗议书。这项抗议书表示，如果公司方面处罚工人，他们将展开实力斗争，来回击镇压暴行。
    今天还有六百名邮电工人和五百名政府公务人员分别在邮政省、大藏省和农林省大厦前面举行大会和示威游行，强烈要求撤销岸信介政府处罚工人的计划。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本又有两个地方议会要求解散国会。据“朝日新闻”今天报道，新澙县柏崎市议会在2日举行的会议上通过一项决议，要求解散国会。决议说，岸信介集团以修改“安全条约”问题为开端，对人民生活造成了恶劣影响。政府必须解散国会，听取民意。
    在这以前，京都府议会曾经在1日举行的会议上通过决议，要求解散国会。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎2日透露：自由民主党决定在13日以前先在国会选出新首相，然后在13日召开的自由民主党大会上推荐新首相为这个党的新总裁，以便接替早已臭名远扬的岸信介。
    自由民主党历来是先在党内选出总裁，然后由总裁出面组阁和担任首相。这次所以一反惯例，是由于岸信介阴谋利用他赖着不下台的时机先决定他“合意”的下届首相人选，以便于控制和影响下届内阁继续执行日美军事同盟的政策，避免将来在自由民主党大会上选出他所“不合意”的总裁。
    岸信介自从6月23日被迫宣布
  “决心辞职”以来，利用党内矛盾，对党内的“中间派”和“反主流派”采取了一打一拉的手段，企图从而继续控制这个党。岸信介向“中间派”的池田勇人、大野伴睦、石井光次郎分别表示，谁同意他的三条件，他就推荐谁为下届首相。他的三条件是：加强新“安全条约”体系；肃清对新“安全条约”采取批判态度的党内“异己分子”；加强“治安”政策。与此同时，岸信介声言要“整党”，开除“反主流派”的河野一郎和三木武夫等人。
    岸信介的这种作法，使自由民主党内部的争权夺利的斗争更加热闹起来。被岸信介暗示有继任下届首相希望的池田、大野和石井都在加紧活动。
    前首相吉田茂为池田四方奔走。据“读卖新闻”透露，吉田茂在6月24日会见石井，要他打消当下届首相的念头。日本广播协会电台说，为了推荐池田当首相，吉田茂将对岸信介等“主流派”进行“强有力的工作”。
    大野和石井表示要联合起来对抗池田勇人，并且对岸信介表示不满。大野在今天会见岸信介时指出，
  “主流派”的动向会影响选定下届首相，并且会引起保守政党的危机。大野要求“主流派”明确它到底要支持谁上台，并且表示要同石井联合起来进行抗衡。接着，大野派和石井派的议员举行了联络会议，研究加强联合行动的问题。
    岸信介正是要利用池田同大野、石井集团之间的矛盾，企图从中渔利。日本广播电台2日指出，池田派在两院拥有六、七十名议员，大野派是五、六十名，石井派最多是四十五名，这种不相上下的形势，对于拥有多数的岸、佐藤的“主流派”来说，“是有机可乘的”。
    被岸信介集团看成“整党”对象的“反主流派”河野一郎和三木武夫等人，表示要反击岸信介。
    河野派2日发表声明，强烈抨击岸信介阴谋排斥“反主流派”和干涉下届内阁的政策和组织。声明谴责“主流派”企图开除“反主流派”，并且表示不能容许这一阴谋得逞。声明说，“春秋会”（河野派组织）将积极展开坚决的行动。
    消息说，河野派同时决定将在5日再次召开会议，商讨今后对付
  “主流派”的具体态度。
    据“东京新闻”今天报道，三木—松村派和石桥派的代表2日同河野派代表举行会议，决定支持河野派的声明。
    消息说，由于自由民主党内的派系斗争更加激烈，预定在13日举行的自由民主党大会究竟谁能被选为总裁，选举的方法是推荐还是竞选，目前还难以预料。（附图片）
