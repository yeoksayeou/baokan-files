(Our dispatch from Hefei, July 29th) The workers of the Fanshang Mining Bureau in Anhui Province are making every effort to improve the quality of ore, resulting in a steady increase in ore grade. This year, the iron content of the ore transported by the bureau has consistently remained above 52%, reaching a maximum of 63%, earning unanimous praise from user units.

The Fanshang Iron Mine has developed from primitive methods of mining since 1958, and currently has more than fifty production sites. In the first half of this year, the mine has already completed 63% of its annual plan. The characteristics of these "small indigenous groups" of mines are: dispersed layout, large powder content in the ore body, and many impurities, which brings great difficulties to improving quality. The mine's workers were not daunted by the difficulties. They first reminded everyone of the importance of improving quality by calculating accounts. For example, when they calculated how much more coke would be needed for each percentage point the ore grade decreased, how much less iron would be produced, and how much the sulfur, phosphorus, and other impurities in pig iron would increase, many workers expressed their determination to produce high-quality ore for the iron and steel production departments.

On the basis of improved ideological understanding, the workers grasped quality at every stage of production. They also formulated various rules and regulations to ensure quality and carried out mass inspection activities. Aiming at some weak links that affect quality, they first strengthened the geological work of the mine; improved production management in all aspects, and strictly implemented the "three nos, two nos, and three grades" mining methods. For example, before mining, they first tested the ore. All ore bodies that have not been tested, or have an iron content of less than 40% or a sulfur content greater than one, are not mined; the mined ore is not transferred unless it has been tested or the powder rate and depletion rate are greater than 8%. In the management of ore production, rich ore and poor ore are also mined, transported, and stored in separate grades, avoiding the mixing of poor ore into rich ore and ensuring the grade of rich ore. They also strengthened the stripping work of the mine, reversing the idea of emphasizing mining and neglecting stripping, and ensuring that stripping leads, so that the topsoil layer cannot be mixed into the ore. They tightened the testing checkpoint, the appraisal checkpoint, the hand-selection checkpoint at the pond, the stacking checkpoint, the intermediate transportation checkpoint, and the loading checkpoint. If the quality was found to be substandard at each checkpoint, mining and transportation would be stopped immediately. The serious implementation of these measures has effectively guaranteed the improvement of ore quality.

The use of indigenous methods for washing and dressing ore is also an important measure for the mine to improve ore quality and recovery rate. Because the ore body itself contains a certain amount of powdered ore, coupled with factors such as mining, crushing, and transportation, about 30 tons of powdered ore are produced for every 100 tons of ore mined. Before washing and dressing, these powdered ores were piled up on the mountain as waste, which not only affected the mine's production but also caused a great waste of resources. From 1958 to the present, the mine has accumulated 300,000 tons of ore powder, and the iron content is relatively high. In the past, they believed that the mine's resources were very rich, and they emphasized the difficulty of not having washing and dressing equipment, so these ore powders were never used well. Since the national conference of medium-sized and small mines put forward the full utilization of mine resources this year, they realized the importance of recovering ore powder. From March of this year, they began to vigorously promote indigenous washing and dressing methods. The results of washing and dressing proved that 7,000 tons of concentrate can be recovered from every 10,000 tons of ore powder. The iron content of the ore powder after washing and dressing can generally be increased by 7% to 10%, and the silicon dioxide is reduced by 10% to 15%. This not only turns waste into use, turns poor ore into rich ore, but also makes it more suitable for small blast furnace smelting after washing and dressing.

### 繁昌铁矿把紧化验、洗选、分级管理等道道关口  不许低品位矿石下山

    繁昌铁矿把紧化验、洗选、分级管理等道道关口
    不许低品位矿石下山
    本报合肥29日电　安徽省繁昌矿务局职工千方百计地提高矿石质量，使矿石品位稳步上升。今年来，这个局外运矿石的含铁量一直保持在52％以上，最高达到63％，获得使用单位的一致好评。
    繁昌铁矿是从1958年用土法开采发展起来的，目前生产的矿点有五十多个。今年上半年这个矿已经完成了全年计划的63％。这些“小土群”矿山的特点是：布点分散，矿体含粉量较大，杂质较多，给提高质量带来很大困难。这个矿的职工并没有为困难所难倒，他们首先通过算账的方式，提醒大家认识提高质量的重要。如他们在算矿石每降低一个品位，就要多用多少焦炭、要少出多少铁，要增加生铁的含硫、磷等杂质时，许多职工纷纷表示决心要生产质量高的矿石供应钢铁生产部门。
    在思想认识提高的基础上，职工们从生产的各个环节来抓质量。并制定了保证质量的各种规章制度，开展了群众性的检查活动。针对影响质量的一些薄弱环节，他们首先加强了矿山地质工作；从各方面改进生产管理，严格贯彻执行了“三不采、两不调”和“三分”的开采方法。如在开采之前，他们首先对矿石进行化验，凡是没有化验过的，或含铁量低于40％、含硫量大于一的矿体一律不开采；采出来的矿石，不经化验或含粉率、贫化率大于8％的一概不外调。在矿石生产管理上，富矿和贫矿也都做到了分级开采，分级搬运，分级堆存，避免了贫矿混入富矿，保证了富矿的品位。并且加强了矿山的剥离工作，扭转了重采矿轻剥离的思想，做到了剥离领先，这样就使表土层不能混入矿石内。他们把紧了化验关、鉴定关、塘口手选关、码方上堆关、中途运输关、上汽车关，每个关口上发现质量不合要求时，就立即停止开采和调运。由于认真执行了这些措施，有力地保证了矿石质量的提高。
    采用土法洗选矿石，也是这个矿提高矿石质量和回收率的一个重要措施。由于矿体本身含有一定数量的粉矿，加上开采、破碎、搬运等因素，一般每开采一百吨矿石，就要产生三十吨粉矿。这些粉矿在没有洗选以前，都当作废料堆积在山上，不仅影响了矿山的生产，而且造成资源很大的浪费。这个矿从1958年到现在，已堆积了矿粉三十万吨，而且含铁量比较高。过去，他们认为矿山的资源很丰富，加上强调没有洗选设备的困难，因此这些矿粉始终没有很好利用起来。从今年全国中、小型矿山会议提出充分利用矿山资源以后，他们认识到回收矿粉的重要意义，从今年3月份开始，就大搞土法洗选。洗选的结果证明，每万吨矿粉就可以回收精矿七千吨，经过洗选后的矿粉含铁量一般可提高7％到10％，二氧化矽降低10％到15％。这不仅变无用为有用、变贫矿为富矿，而且经过洗选，粗粮细作，更适合于小高炉冶炼了。
