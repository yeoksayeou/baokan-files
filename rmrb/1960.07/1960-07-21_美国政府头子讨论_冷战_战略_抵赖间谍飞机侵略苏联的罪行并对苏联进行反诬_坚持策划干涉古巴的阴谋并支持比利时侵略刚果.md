(Excerpt from the "Moscow Declaration of the Representatives Conference of Communist and Workers’ Parties of Socialist Countries")
    The American imperialist aggressive bloc attempts to rule most countries in the world by relying on the so-called policy of "position of strength," and tries to obstruct mankind's progress in accordance with the laws of social development. Under the guise of "anti-communism," they try to eliminate democracy and freedom, threaten the national independence of developed capitalist countries, want to re-enslave the already liberated people in new forms of colonial shackles, and constantly conduct hostile subversive activities against socialist countries. The policy of certain aggressive groups in the United States is to gather all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world around them. Thus, these groups become the center of reactionary forces throughout the world and the most ferocious enemies of the masses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: US President Eisenhower held a "Cold War" strategy meeting with Secretary of State Herter and a group of senior State Department officials in Newport, Rhode Island, on the 19th, planning further actions by the United States to escalate the international situation.

    In addition to Eisenhower and Herter, those attending the meeting included former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Kohler, and Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Wilcox, among others. It was revealed that senior US decision-makers discussed issues such as Soviet-US relations, the Cuban situation, and the Congo situation at this meeting, and in particular studied the "next steps" the United States should take on these issues.

    Herter held a brief press conference after the meeting, indicating that the United States would continue to pursue its aggressive policy on the above issues. He falsely accused the Soviet Union's stern condemnation of the United States for sabotaging the four-power summit conference and repeatedly sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace as "highly provocative," and emphasized that the United States would deny the provocative behavior of American spy planes at the upcoming Security Council meeting. At the same time, Herter slandered Cuba as being infiltrated by "external influences," emphasizing that the United States would insist on discussing the so-called "external influence penetration" issue through the Organization of American States in order to further plan armed intervention in Cuba. Regarding the Congo situation, Herter tried his best to support the Belgian colonialists, openly opposed the Congolese government's demand for the immediate withdrawal of the Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo, and described this just demand of the Congo as a "threat" to Belgium. Herter emphasized that the United States believes that there "must be sufficient United Nations forces to ensure the restoration of order" in the Congo. He also said that the Belgian troops cannot withdraw from the Congo according to Lumumba's ultimatum.

    美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓“实力地位”政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。它们打着“反共”的幌子，力图消灭民主自由，威胁发达的资本主义国家的民族独立，想要以新的形式给已经解放了的人民重新套上殖民枷锁，并且经常不断地对社会主义国家进行敌对的颠覆活动。美国某些侵略集团的政策是要把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样，这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。

    美国政府头子讨论“冷战”战略
    抵赖间谍飞机侵略苏联的罪行并对苏联进行反诬
    坚持策划干涉古巴的阴谋并支持比利时侵略刚果
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔19日在罗得岛的新港同国务卿赫脱和国务院的一批高级官员举行“冷战”战略会议，策划美国进一步加剧国际局势的行动。
    出席会议的除了艾森豪威尔和赫脱外，还有前驻苏大使波伦、欧洲事务助理国务卿帮办科勒和国务院国际组织事务助理国务卿威耳科克斯等人。据透露，美国高级决策人在这个会议上讨论了苏美关系、古巴局势和刚果局势等问题，特别是研究了美国在这些问题上采取的“下一步行动”。
    赫脱在会后举行了一个简短的记者招待会，表明美国在上述问题上仍将继续推行侵略政策。他诬蔑苏联对美国破坏四国政府首脑会议和屡次派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的严正指责“带有很大的挑衅性”，并且强调美国在将要举行的安全理事会会议上将要为美国间谍飞机的挑衅行为进行抵赖。赫脱同时诽谤古巴受到“外部影响的渗透”，强调美国要坚持通过美洲国家组织讨论所谓“外部影响渗透”问题，以便进一步策划武装干涉古巴的阴谋。关于刚果局势，赫脱极力给比利时殖民主义者撑腰，公然反对刚果政府提出的比利时侵略军立即撤出刚果的要求，并把刚果这一严正的要求说成是对比利时的“威胁”。赫脱强调说，美国认为，在刚果“要有足够的联合国军队来保证恢复秩序”。并说比利时军队不能按照卢蒙巴的通牒撤出刚果。
