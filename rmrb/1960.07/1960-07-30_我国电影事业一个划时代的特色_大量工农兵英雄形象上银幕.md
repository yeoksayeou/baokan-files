Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: A landmark feature of China's film industry is that a large number of worker, peasant, and soldier masses have stepped onto the screen as masters.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, China's film art has embarked on a path of prosperity from a poor and blank starting point at the time of liberation. In the eleven years since liberation, we have produced more than 480 artistic films and feature-length documentaries, and more than 3,400 various short films. They include a wide range of subjects, diverse artistic styles and forms, and are ideologically connected by the same red line - serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, and serving the socialist cause. The unity of political consistency and diversity of artistic styles has become a major symbol of China's current film art achievements.

The political and artistic levels that China's film art has reached are concentratedly reflected in the thirty-eight films dedicated to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and a batch of excellent films recently released. These films have shaped many vivid, realistic, and typical images of worker-peasant-soldier heroes and advanced figures in history. Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang in "The Storm" and Instructor Li Youguo in "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" are all awe-inspiring and ambitious, demonstrating the glorious image of the working class vanguard; Lao Zhan in "The Veteran's New Story" is a communist fighter full of revolutionary optimism, using the courage and drive to defeat class enemies to fight against nature, so there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of him; in the documentary art film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers", we see a group of workers, peasants and revolutionary cadres with proletarian feelings and a high degree of collectivist spirit, and we feel the pulse of the times and the spirit of communism in them; documentaries such as "Heroes Overcome the Great Northern Wilderness", "Locking the Yellow Dragon" and "Green Wilderness" also have a distinct protagonist, that is, the hardworking, intelligent, and brave worker-peasant-soldier working people under the leadership of the Party. The subjects of these films are very broad, and the artistic styles of the films are rich and varied, and each is different. In terms of artistic expression, these films strive to use the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism to reflect and portray the struggles, lives and ideals of the worker-peasant masses.

These films have achieved considerable success in the artistic skills of screenwriting, directing and acting. For example, films such as "Young People in Our Village", "Spring is Full of the World", "Lin Zexu", and "A Riot of Colour is Always Spring" all have clear themes, strict structures, clear character personalities, and successfully apply dramatic details. They also use very few shots to depict great scenes, clearly explain the plot, and fully utilize the characteristics of film art.

The many excellent artistic films, documentary art films, news documentaries, stage documentaries, and various forms of art films and science education films that we have produced in the past eleven years constitute a garden of a hundred flowers serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have obtained rich spiritual food in this garden and have been greatly educated and encouraged. They love the movies that depict themselves, and movies have become an important part of their cultural life. In 1949, when the country was just liberated, the total number of domestic and foreign film viewers was more than 47 million, and in 1959, the total number of film viewers reached 4.16 billion, including more than 3.74 billion viewers of domestic films. According to statistics at the end of 1959, "The White-Haired Girl" had 160 million viewers; and films such as "Shangganling", "Reconnaissance Across the River", "Dong Cunrui", and "Railway Guerrilla" all had more than 130 million viewers.

Our film workers, under the leadership of the Party, have been able to successfully shape a large number of great images of workers, peasants, and soldiers; and have been able to produce so many films that are popular among workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is inseparable from their going deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, going to the countryside and factories, participating in labor, and striving to transform their ideology, thereby gradually establishing and consolidating the proletarian world outlook.

In order to fully meet the needs of the worker-peasant-soldier masses, since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, all aspects of China's film industry have developed rapidly. In 1949, when the country was just liberated, there were only a handful of film studios in the country. By the end of 1959, it had developed to thirty-three. Except for the Tibet region, every province, city, and autonomous region had a film studio. The number of urban screening units increased from more than 600 in 1949 to more than 7,800; the number of rural screening units developed from nothing to 7,000, and a screening network covering the entire country has been formed.

### 我国电影事业一个划时代的特色  大量工农兵英雄形象上银幕

    我国电影事业一个划时代的特色
    大量工农兵英雄形象上银幕
    据新华社29日讯　大量工农兵群众的形象以主人翁的姿态走上了银幕，是我国电影事业的一个划时代的特色。
    我国的电影艺术在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下，从解放时贫白的起点走上了繁荣的道路。解放十一年来，我们已经摄制了艺术片和长纪录片四百八十多部和各种短片三千四百多部。它们包括了广阔的题材、多样的艺术风格和形式，而在思想上贯穿着同一根红线——为工农兵服务，为社会主义事业服务。政治上的一致性和艺术风格的多样性的统一，已成为我国目前电影艺术成就的一个主要标志。
    我国电影艺术已经达到的政治水平和艺术水平，集中地表现在向建国十周年献礼的三十八部影片和新近公映的一批优秀影片中。这些片子塑造了许多鲜明、真实、典型的工农兵英雄和历史上先进人物的形象。“风暴”里的林祥谦、施洋和“万水千山”里的教导员李有国，都是大义凛然，壮志凌云，表现了工人阶级先锋队的光辉形象；“老兵新传”里的老战，是一个充满着革命乐观主义精神的共产主义战士，他用战胜阶级敌人的勇气和干劲来向自然作斗争，因此在他面前就没有克服不了的困难；在纪录性艺术片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”里，我们看到了一批具有无产阶级感情、高度集体主义精神的工人、农民和革命干部，在他们的身上我们感觉到时代的脉搏、共产主义的精神；纪录片“英雄战胜北大荒”、“锁住黄龙”和“绿色的原野”等，也都有着一个性格鲜明的主角，这就是党领导下的勤劳、智慧、勇敢的工农兵劳动人民。这许多影片的题材非常广阔，影片的艺术风格则又是丰富多彩，各不相同。在艺术表现上，这许多影片都力求用革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，来反映、刻划工农群众的斗争、生活和理想。
    这些影片在编剧、导演和表演的艺术技巧上都达到了相当高的成就。如“我们村里的年轻人”“春满人间”“林则徐”“万紫千红总是春”等片子，都是主题鲜明、结构谨严、人物性格明朗，成功地应用了戏剧性的细节，而且用极少的镜头描绘出了伟大的场面，把情节交代得清清楚楚，充分发挥了电影艺术的特长。
    十一年来我们生产的许多优秀的艺术片、纪录性艺术片、新闻纪录片、舞台纪录片以及各种形式的美术片和科学教育片，构成了一座为工农兵服务的百花园。广大工农兵群众在这个百花园中取得了丰富的精神食粮，受到巨大的教育和鼓舞。他们热爱着表现他们自己的电影，电影已经成为他们文化生活中的重要内容之一。1949年刚解放时国产片和外国片的观众共四千七百多万人次，1959年全部电影观众达到四十一亿六千万人次，其中国产片的观众三十七亿四千多万人次。根据1959年底的统计，“白毛女”的观众达一亿六千万人次；“上甘岭”、“渡江侦察记”、“董存瑞”、“铁道游击队”等片子的观众都在一亿三千万人次以上。
    我们的电影工作者在党的领导下能够成功地塑造了大量工农兵的伟大形象；能够制作出这许多为工农兵喜闻乐见的影片，是和他们深入工农兵生活、下乡下厂、参加劳动、努力改造思想从而逐渐建立并巩固无产阶级世界观分不开的。
    为了充分满足工农兵群众的需要，解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，我国电影事业的各个方面都有了飞跃的发展。1949年刚解放时，全国电影制片厂只有寥寥几个，到1959年底，已发展到三十三个，除西藏地区外，每个省、市、自治区都有了制片厂，城市放映单位从1949年的六百多个增长到七千八百多个；农村放映单位从一无所有发展到七千个，一个遍及全国城乡的放映网已经形成。
