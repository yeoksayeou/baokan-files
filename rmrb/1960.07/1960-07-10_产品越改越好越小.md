The workers of the Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory have launched a surge of enthusiasm for everyone striving to be "worth several people." By mid-June, all the factory's major products had been converted to ultra-small sizes, achieving: one factory equivalent to three, one person equivalent to four, and one material equivalent to four (with pictures).

　　Female worker Zhu Lingbao, who had just shed her illiteracy, painstakingly studied and modified the design of the microvolt potentiometer she had successfully trial-produced. After two days of hard work, she finally reduced the volume of this product by half. This is her calibrating the microvolt potentiometer.

　　Young worker Gong Xigen successfully trial-produced an ultra-small standard battery, requiring only one-seventh of the original materials. This is him inspecting the ultra-small standard battery.

　　Young female worker Kuang Shifen (left one) further improved the temperature-measuring potentiometer, making the portable product small enough to fit in a pocket, achieving one material equivalent to eight and one person equivalent to eight. (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Putao)

    产品越改越好越小
    上海科培仪器厂职工掀起了人人争做“一顶几”的热潮。到6月中旬止，全厂主要产品都已改为超小型，实现了：厂一顶三、人一顶四、材料一顶四（附图片）
    刚摘掉文盲帽子的女工朱玲宝，苦心研究改变自己试制成功的微伏电位差计的设计。奋战两天，终于把这项产品的体积缩小一半，这是她正在校验微伏电位差计
    青年工人龚锡根，试制成功一种超小型标准电池，所需材料只要原来的七分之一。这是他在检验超小型标准电池
    青年女工匡世芬（左一），进一步改进测温电位差计，使手提的产品体积缩小到可以放在口袋里，实现了一份材料顶八份、一个人顶八个人　　　新华社记者　杨溥涛摄
