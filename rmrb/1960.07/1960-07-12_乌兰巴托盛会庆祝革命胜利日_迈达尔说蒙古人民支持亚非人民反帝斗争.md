Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 11th. Ulaanbaatar held a grand military parade and mass procession this morning to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. Mongolian party and state leaders Tsedenbal, Sambuu, Tsende, and others reviewed the armed forces and the marching masses.

　　Minister of People's Army Affairs and Commander of the People's Army, Lieutenant General Lhagvasuren, spoke at today's mass rally. In his speech, he praised the unprecedented strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and reiterated the unwavering peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Mongolian People's Republic. He said that imperialism is expanding its arms race and engaging in "cold war" activities, interfering in the internal affairs of countries striving for national independence. Under the united struggle of socialist countries and the people of the world, the conspiracies of imperialism have repeatedly met with shameful defeat.

　　He said that the working people of our country and all peace-loving and righteous people in the world fully agree with the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, believing that this is the correct way to rationally solve the disarmament issue, which is currently an important international issue.

　　To celebrate the 39th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar also held a celebration on the evening of the 10th. Mongolian party and government leaders such as Tsedenbal and Tsende, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia, attended the celebration.

　　Maidar, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, Mongolia has made great achievements in economy, culture, and other fields. He said that the new constitution adopted by the recent Great People's Hural reflects the achievements made by the Mongolian people and points out the bright prospects for building socialism and communism. During the third five-year plan (1961-1965), Mongolia will take a major step in establishing the material and technical basis of socialism.

　　Maidar said that our government pursues a policy of developing and consolidating friendly relations based on the principle of peaceful coexistence with the peace-loving people of all countries, supports the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism and for national liberation and independence, and pays close attention to consolidating friendly relations with these countries.

　　Maidar said that the Mongolian people will further consolidate their sovereignty and independence, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism in the struggle to completely build socialism in their motherland, further consolidate friendly cooperation with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all progressive mankind, obtain a legitimate seat in the United Nations, and make corresponding contributions to the activities of international organizations.

　　He said that in the past period, the forces striving for peace have grown stronger, and the power and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have been further consolidated and developed. At the same time, the reactionary intentions of the "cold war" elements headed by US imperialism against peace have repeatedly failed. Their internal contradictions and crises have become more acute.

　　Maidar said that the Mongolian people severely condemn the imperialist aggressive acts of continuing to divide Korea and Vietnam and fully support the just struggle of the fraternal Korean and Vietnamese people to insist on driving foreign aggressor troops out of their homeland.

　　He said that the Mongolian people condemn the policy of the US imperialist armed forces shielding the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique hiding in Taiwan, an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.

　　Tsedenbal held a grand banquet on the evening of the 11th to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

　　乌兰巴托盛会庆祝革命胜利日
　　迈达尔说蒙古人民支持亚非人民反帝斗争
    新华社乌兰巴托11日电　乌兰巴托今天上午举行了盛大的阅兵式和群众游行，庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十九周年。蒙古党和国家领导人泽登巴尔、桑布、曾德等检阅了武装部队和群众的游行队伍。
    蒙古人民军事务部长兼人民军司令员勒哈格瓦苏伦中将在今天的群众集会上讲了话。他在讲话中赞扬了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的空前强大和团结，并申述了蒙古人民共和国所奉行的坚定不移的和平外交政策。他说，帝国主义正在扩军备战，继续进行“冷战”活动，干涉争取民族独立国家的内政。在社会主义各国和世界人民团结一致的斗争下，帝国主义的阴谋不断遭到可耻的失败。
    他说，我国劳动人民和世界一切爱好和平的正义人们完全赞同苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，认为这是合理解决作为目前国际重要问题的裁军问题的正确道路。
    为庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十九周年，乌兰巴托各界人民10日晚还举行了庆祝会。泽登巴尔、曾德等蒙古党政领导人，以及各国驻蒙古的外交使节出席了庆祝会。
    蒙古人民革命党中央政治局候补委员、部长会议副主席迈达尔在会上作了报告。他指出，自蒙古人民革命胜利以来，蒙古在经济、文化等方面取得了巨大的成就。他说，最近大人民呼拉尔会议通过的新宪法，反映了蒙古人民取得的成就，同时指出了建设社会主义和共产主义的美好前景。在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，蒙古将在建立社会主义物质技术基础方面迈出一大步。
    迈达尔说，我国政府奉行在同爱好和平的各国人民和平共处的原则基础上发展和巩固友好关系的政策，支持亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族解放和独立的斗争，很注意巩固同这些国家的友好关系。
    迈达尔说，蒙古人民将更加巩固自己的主权和独立，在祖国彻底建成社会主义的斗争中高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，更加巩固同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全体进步人类的友好合作，在联合国取得合法席位，在国际组织的活动中作出相应的贡献。
    他说，在过去的期间，争取和平的力量壮大了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和团结更加巩固和发展了。与此同时，以美帝国主义为首的“冷战”分子反对和平的反动意图一再失败。他们的内部矛盾和危机更加尖锐了。
    迈达尔说，蒙古人民严厉谴责帝国主义使朝鲜、越南继续分裂的侵略行为，完全支持兄弟般的朝鲜和越南人民坚持从自己的祖国赶走外国侵略军的正义斗争。
    他说，蒙古人民谴责美帝国主义的武装力量庇护躲在中华人民共和国领土不可分割的部分——台湾的蒋介石反动集团的政策。
    泽登巴尔在11日晚上为庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十九周年举行了盛大的宴会。
