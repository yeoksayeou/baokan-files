　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch: To adapt to the new leaping forward situation, the Xiaba River Commune in Xishui County, Hubei Province, has moved the Commune Party Committee and Commune Management Committee organs to production teams. Half a year of experience has proven that after the organs move to the grassroots level, leading cadres can further overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, strengthen ties with the masses, and promote the all-round leap forward of the commune. Now, thirteen of the eighteen backward teams in the whole commune have been transformed into first-class teams. The Huanggang Prefectural Committee and Xishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have comprehensively promoted this experience.
    In February of this year, the Xiaba River Commune Party Committee moved the commune organs from the bustling town of Xiaba River to the first team of the "May 1st" production team in the Qipu Management District, living in ordinary people's houses. In front of the house is a large area of high-yield farmland jointly run by the commune cadres and commune members, and behind the house is the public canteen of the production team. Commune cadres and commune members eat in the same canteen. The masses are happy to stop at the commune entrance when they return from the fields to rest, drink water, and chat. From these kind conversations, the commune cadres learned many situations that they could not learn at meetings in the past. The cadres not only achieved "three togethers" with commune members (eat together, live together, and work together), but also rest together, study together, and research production technology together. In the past, cadres had to go out of the organs and go down to the team to achieve the "three togethers," and they would not be "together" once they left the team and returned to the organs. Now, it is not just some cadres who are settling in among the commune members, but the entire commune organ is settling in among the masses. They live completely with the commune members, and the cadres and commune members are as close as family.
    The commune organs live in the countryside, throwing off the "organ airs," and the leadership of production and life is more thorough and solid. This year, when transplanting early rice seedlings, the commune Party committee said, based on the statistics from the office telephone, that the base fertilizer for early rice in each team was sufficient. However, when the commune cadres ate with the commune members, they heard that the fertilizer was still not enough, which aroused the attention of the leadership. They immediately conducted an in-depth inspection, which proved that the situation reflected by the commune members was true. The entire commune immediately launched a five-day crash campaign to harvest green manure to ensure that all early rice was applied with sufficient base fertilizer. Because the situation is clear and the problems are accurately grasped, the number of empty meetings has been greatly reduced. In the five months from February, the commune held only fourteen meetings, nine of which were on-site meetings. The rest of the time was mostly used to participate in production and organize learning. From February to June, thirty-eight commune cadres have already done more than 10,300 work points, which is 6,065 more points than in the same period last year.
    After the Commune Party Committee and Management Committee organs moved to the countryside, various departments also moved to the front line.

### 下巴河公社领导机关搬到基层　干部跟社员一起生活，亲如家人

　　下巴河公社领导机关搬到基层
　　干部跟社员一起生活，亲如家人
    据新华社武汉电　湖北浠水县下巴河公社为适应新的跃进形势，把公社党委会和公社管理委员会机关搬到生产小队落户。半年来的经验证明，机关搬到基层以后，可以使领导干部进一步克服官僚主义和主观主义，密切和群众的联系，促进公社的全面跃进。现在全社十八个落后队已有十三个转变成为一类队。中共黄冈地委和浠水县委已经全面推广了这一经验。
    下巴河公社党委在今年2月就把公社机关从热闹的下巴河镇上搬到七铺管理区“五一”生产队的第一小队，住在普通民房里。屋前是公社干部和社员合办的大片丰产畈，屋后便是生产小队的公共食堂，公社的干部和社员在一个食堂吃饭。群众从田畈里回来都乐意在公社门口歇一歇，喝喝水，聊聊天。公社干部从这些亲切的闲谈中了解到许多过去在会议上无法了解到的情况。干部们不仅做到了和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，而且还和社员同休息、同学习、同研究生产技术。过去干部要走出机关下到小队才能“三同”，一离开小队回到机关就不“同”了。现在他们不只是某些干部到社员中落户，而是整个公社机关到群众中落户了。他们和社员完全生活在一起，干部社员亲如家人。
    公社机关住在农村，甩掉了“机关架子”，领导生产和领导生活更加深入扎实了。今年插早稻秧时，公社党委根据办公室电话统计材料说，各队早稻底肥都已经足了，可是公社干部同社员一起吃饭时，听社员说肥料还不够，引起领导上的注意，马上深入进行检查，证明社员反映的情况属实，全社立即突击打青肥五天，保证全部早稻施足了底肥。因为情况看得清，问题抓得准，大大地减少了空泛的会议。公社从2月起五个月来只开了十四次会议，其中有九次是现场会。其余的时间大部分用来参加生产和组织学习。三十八个公社干部从2月到6月已经做了一万零三百多个工分，比去年同期多做六千零六十五分。
    公社党委会和管委会机关搬到农村后，各个部门也搬到了第一线。
