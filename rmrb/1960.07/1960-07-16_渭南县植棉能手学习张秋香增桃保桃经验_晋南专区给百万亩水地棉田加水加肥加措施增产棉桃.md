　　Weinan County Cotton Growing Experts Learn from Zhang Qiuxiang's Experience in Increasing and Protecting Cotton Bolls
　　Jinnan Prefecture Adds Water, Fertilizer, and Measures to One Million Mu of Irrigated Cotton Fields to Increase Cotton Boll Production

　　This newspaper reports that seven hundred representatives from the "Qiuxiang Field" farming groups in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, gathered in Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton field to learn the "three increases" (increase pre-flowering bolls, increase flowering bolls, increase autumn bolls) and "three protections" (protect pre-flowering bolls, protect flowering bolls, protect autumn bolls) experience in cotton management, and to prepare for launching a battle to prevent cotton boll abscission in a timely manner. Through the study, the representatives put forward the heroic slogan of "fight for eighty days, bring big bolls into the hot season, ensure flowering bolls are full, strive for autumn bolls to cover the top, and vow to win a bumper cotton harvest this year."

　　According to the reports from the "Qiuxiang Field" representatives from various places, the more than 570,000 mu of cotton fields planted in Weinan this year have generally been hoed three or four times, and pests have been prevented three to five times. 30% of the cotton fields have been fertilized to promote budding and irrigated with water to resist drought and promote budding, and more than 40,000 mu of "Qiuxiang Field" cotton has had their lower leaves removed. At present, the cotton plants are nearly a foot tall, and budding and flowering are common, which is a critical time to focus on "management." During the visit, what particularly caught everyone's attention was that the eight mu of high-yield cotton cultivated by Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team this year are strong, and each plant has an average of eight or nine branches and has formed more than twenty flower buds; the most branches reach twelve, and there are more than forty buds. Although the drought has lasted for a long time, the cotton of this planting group does not show any signs of boll abscission.

　　During the on-site visit, everyone discussed the problem of large-scale abscission of cotton buds and bolls in previous years during this period, and asked Zhang Qiuxiang to introduce his experience in preventing abscission.

　　Through on-site visits and exchange of experiences, the representatives believed that Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team's experience of "three increases and three protections" is the direction of current cotton field management. They also jointly studied and proposed specific measures to implement this experience: (1) Take drought resistance as the key, water and fertilizer as the priority, and launch a concentrated cotton field management campaign. It is required that each mu of cotton field should strive to achieve three waterings and three fertilizations during this period, and apply 6,000 to 10,000 jin of top dressing per mu; and carefully hoe three times (two inches deep), and prune in time to achieve no weeds, no soil hardening, no excessive growth, no lack of fertilizer, and no drought. (2) "Protection" should be emphasized, and current cotton field pests should be immediately eliminated. In terms of prevention and control methods, it is required that within the next three to five days, cotton aphids, cotton bollworms, and thrips should be eliminated first, so as to prevent leaf rot and boll abscission due to diseases and insect pests. (3) Carry out a "five accelerations" movement in cotton field management, that is, accelerate replanted cotton to catch up with regular cotton, low-yield to catch up with high-yield, dry cotton to catch up with irrigated cotton, third-class fields to catch up with first-class fields, and large fields to catch up with high-yield fields. It is required that 8,000 to 10,000 seedlings be set for replanted cotton, and all third-class fields should be eliminated by mid-July, so that general fields will enter the hot season with three bolls, high-yield fields will enter the hot season with five bolls, and demonstration fields will enter the hot season with ten bolls. (4) Vigorously develop high-yield cotton fields. The county has already designated 240,000 mu of cotton fields with water conservancy conditions as high-yield fields, requiring 200,000 mu to produce 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 40,000 mu to produce 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and carry out red flag competitions between communes, teams, and groups.

　　This on-site meeting on "three increases and three protections" for cotton is a mobilization meeting to march towards cotton field management. The Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Weinan County People's Committee gave great support. County Party Secretary Liu Tongfa and County Mayor Zhao Baoren personally participated in the leadership. During the meeting, Zhang Qiuxiang, Xue Junxiu, Gao Zhenxian, Cao Zhuxiang, and Shan Xiuzhen jointly proposed a "three increases and three protections" initiative to cotton farmers throughout the county. The representatives of the "Qiuxiang Field" also put forward conditions to each other on the spot and launched a competition. Now, the representatives have gone to various places, taking the five silver flowers as the core, and spreading the "three increases and three protections" experience in areas.

　　This newspaper reports that the one million drought-resistant army in Jinnan Prefecture, Shanxi Province, encouraged by the slogan "Exert all efforts, use all water, work hard, and seize high yields," is focusing on intensive work on one million mu of irrigated and semi-irrigated cotton fields, and is resolutely grasping "adding water, adding fertilizer, adding measures, increasing buds, increasing bolls, and increasing yields." At present, a general watering has been carried out to increase budding, fertilizer has been skillfully applied during the budding period, and pest control, pruning, and mid-tillage have been widely carried out.

　　Of the 3.13 million mu of cotton fields in Jinnan Prefecture this year, irrigated and semi-irrigated fields account for 30%, but the output accounts for two-thirds of the total cotton output of the region. Doing a good job in the processing and management of irrigated cotton fields is crucial to achieving a bumper cotton harvest this year. Therefore, in recent days, the people's communes in various places have simultaneously implemented water, fertilizer, protection, and management, and carried out general watering to increase budding, general application of fertilizer to protect budding, general pest control, general pruning, and general mid-tillage for one million mu of irrigated and semi-irrigated cotton. Yuncheng, Houma, Yicheng, Linyi, Hongdong and other counties that mainly produce cotton have formed five combat teams for watering, top dressing, mid-tillage, pest control, and pruning, and are carrying out comprehensive processing and management of irrigated cotton fields. Yuncheng County mobilized 150,000 laborers, thousands of machines, 10,000 water carts, and 10,000 teapots, and universally carried out watering, top dressing, mid-tillage, pest control, and pruning on 200,000 mu of irrigated cotton fields. In Linfen County, with thousands of cadres going deep into the fields to participate in the battle, 42,000 mu of the county's 72,000 mu of irrigated cotton fields were watered and fertilized in seven days.

　　After a series of meticulous management such as universal watering, universal mid-tillage, universal top dressing, universal pest control, and careful pruning, the one million mu of irrigated cotton fields in Jinnan Prefecture have shown a good scene of no insects, no weeds, no soil hardening, no third-class seedlings, many fruit branches, many flower buds, many mature bolls, and few abscission of buds and bolls. The million mu of irrigated cotton are lush green, the seedlings are strong, the plant height is more than one foot, and there are as many as eight pre-flowering bolls per plant. (Attached picture)

　　渭南县植棉能手学习张秋香增桃保桃经验
　　晋南专区给百万亩水地棉田加水加肥加措施增产棉桃
    本报讯　陕西渭南县七百名“秋香田”作务组的代表，会师在张秋香植棉组棉田里，学习棉花管理上的三增（增伏前桃、增伏桃、增秋桃）三保（保伏前桃、保伏桃、保秋桃）经验，并为及时掀起防止棉花落蕾落铃的战斗作好准备。通过学习，代表们提出了“大战八十天，带大桃入伏，保伏桃满腰，争秋桃盖顶，誓夺今年棉花大丰收”的豪迈口号。
    根据各地“秋香田”代表们的汇报，今年渭南种植的五十七万多亩棉田，一般都锄过三、四次，防了三至五次虫害，有30％棉田已施过催蕾肥，浇了抗旱催蕾水，有四万多亩“秋香田”棉花抹了裤腿。目前，棉花株高近尺，普遍现蕾开花，到了“管”字上马的关键时候。在参观中，特别引起大家重视的是，张秋香植棉组今年作务的八亩丰产棉，株株茁壮，现在每株平均有八、九个担子，已结了二十多个花蕾；最多的担子达十二个，现蕾四十多个。虽然干旱日久，这个植棉小组的棉花却看不出落蕾落花的迹象。
    在现场参观活动中，大家讨论了历年这个时期棉花蕾、铃大量脱落的问题，请张秋香介绍了防止脱落的经验。
    通过现场参观和交流经验，代表们都认为张秋香植棉组“三增三保”的经验，是当前棉田管理的方向。他们还共同研究提出了贯彻这项经验的具体措施：（一）抗旱为纲，水肥当先，突击棉田管理。要求在这个时期，每亩棉田力争达到三水三肥，每亩追肥六千至一万斤；并且细锄三次（深达二寸），及时整枝，达到无杂草、无板结、无徒长、无缺肥、无旱象。（二）“保”字升帐，立即扑灭当前棉田虫害。在防治的方法上，要求在最近三五天内，首先扑灭棉蚜、棉铃虫和蓟马的为害，做到不因病虫害烂叶落铃。（三）开展棉田管理上的“五赶”运动，即回茬赶正茬、低产赶高产、旱花赶水花、三类赶一类、大田赶丰产。要求回茬棉定苗八千株至一万株，三类田7月中旬全部消灭，达到一般田带三桃入伏、丰产田带五桃入伏、指挥田带十桃入伏。（四）大搞棉花超产田，全县已经把二十四万亩有水利条件的棉田，划为超产田，要求其中二十万亩亩产百斤皮棉，四万亩亩产二百斤皮棉，并且开展社与社、队与队、组与组间的红旗竞赛。
    这次棉花“三增三保”的现场会，是一个向棉田管理进军的动员会。中共渭南县委会、渭南县人委都给予极大支持。县委刘统法书记和赵葆仁县长亲自参加领导。会议进行期间，以张秋香为首的薛俊秀、高贞贤、曹竹香、山秀珍五朵银花，联合向全县棉农提出了棉花“三增三保”的倡议。各“秋香田”代表也当场互提条件，展开对手赛。现在，代表们已经去各地，分别以五朵银花为核心，分片传授“三增三保”经验。
    本报讯　山西晋南专区百万抗旱大军，在“力使尽，水用完，努力干，夺丰产”的口号鼓舞下，乘抗旱复播之大胜，在一百万亩水地和半水地棉田上重点加工，狠抓“加水、加肥、加措施，增蕾、增铃、增产量”。目前，已进行了普浇增蕾水，巧追蕾期肥，普遍治虫、整枝和中耕。
    今年晋南专区的三百一十三万亩棉田，其中水地、半水地占30％，但产量却占全区棉花总产量的三分之二。搞好水地棉田的加工管理，对争取今年棉花丰收有决定意义。因而连日来，各地人民公社水、肥、保、管齐上马，给一百万亩水地和半水地棉花，进行普浇增蕾水，普追保蕾肥，普治虫，普整枝，普中耕。主要产棉花的运城、侯马、翼城、临猗、洪洞等县，都组成了浇水、追肥、中耕、治虫、整枝等五支战斗队伍，给水地棉花进行全面加工管理。运城县出动十五万劳力，千部机器，万辆水车，万把茶壶，在二十万亩水地棉田上，普遍进行了浇水、追肥、中耕、治虫、整枝。临汾县在千名干部深入田间参战下，全县七万二千亩水地棉田，七天就浇水追肥四万二千亩。
    晋南专区的百万亩水地棉田，经过普浇水，普中耕，普追肥，普治虫，细整枝等一系列的精细管理之后，出现了无虫、无草、无板结、无三类苗，果枝多，花蕾多，成桃多，蕾铃脱落少的大好景象，百万亩水地棉花，亩亩葱绿，苗苗健壮，株高达一尺以上，每株伏前桃达八个之多。（附图片）
