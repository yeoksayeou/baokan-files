We usually say that fulfilling the national industrial production plan means comprehensively completing all aspects of production targets, including quantity targets, quality targets, variety and specification targets, and cost reduction targets. Some people often reduce the completion of the production plan to just completing the quantity targets, which is incorrect. While ensuring the completion of the state product quantity targets, guaranteeing that every product meets the prescribed high quality has always been an important management principle of socialist enterprises. The superiority of socialist enterprises is not only reflected in the quantity of products exceeding the old capitalist enterprises, but also in the first-class quality of products. The quality of our products is improving year by year. According to a survey by the seven industrial bureaus in Shanghai, among the more than 2,100 products produced in the first quarter of this year, more than 1,800 have reached the advanced domestic level, and some have even reached the advanced international level. Among them, the quality of more than 230 products was originally behind the level of advanced regions, but now they have caught up. This material can represent the general trend of national product quality. However, even so, we must still emphasize improving quality. This is because there is no end to improving product quality. Our fundamental attitude towards product quality should be continuous revolution, striving for perfection, and making good things even better.

The quality of any product is never abstract, but concrete. Various products of different varieties and specifications have different specific quality standards in different periods. Product quality standards are always formulated based on the needs of social production development and the level of social production in each period. For example, in 1885, the German Benz invented the world's first automobile. This car was very heavy and slow, but at the time, it was a satisfactory car. But who today would be satisfied with a car of this quality? As social production develops, the requirements for product quality should also be raised accordingly. Without this continuous revolutionary thinking, without striving for perfection and making good things even better, but being satisfied with existing achievements and scratching the surface, the development of the entire social production may stagnate.

Now, China's socialist construction has entered a new historical stage. A better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward in the national economy requires us not only to produce more industrial products, but also to have better quality than in the past. Taking the task of industry supporting agriculture as an example, in the past few years, in terms of machinery manufacturing, it has mainly been producing new-style agricultural tools and small-horsepower irrigation and drainage machinery for agricultural production, and ordinary quality steel was sufficient. Now, with the start of agricultural technological transformation, we must not only continue to produce a large number of new-style agricultural tools, but also produce more tractors, combine harvesters, and trucks; with the completion of many large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, we must not only produce a large number of small-horsepower irrigation and drainage machinery, but also produce large-horsepower irrigation and drainage machinery. These require high-quality steel. In order to improve the quality of steel, it is necessary to improve the quality of steel; and in order to improve the quality of steel, it is necessary to improve the quality of iron. This is one aspect. On the other hand, after more than two years of the Great Leap Forward, the material and technical level of industrial production in our country has also greatly improved. The technical level of the vast number of workers has also been significantly improved. Therefore, although the quality of our products is better than in the past, according to the needs of the development of China's socialist construction cause, and according to the actual technical level that China's industrial production has reached, higher quality requirements are still needed. Of course, this high-quality requirement is not uniform, and there are different requirements for different products. For example, the quality requirements for pig iron used for making agricultural tools and pig iron used for casting precision machinery are of course different. But in general, each product should be the product with the best quality that meets its respective requirements. This high-quality requirement is an indispensable driving force for promoting the continuous development of China's socialist construction cause.

Continuously improving product quality is a task put forward to us by the new situation of current production development, and it is also a long-term principle. The quantity and quality of products are two contradictory and unified aspects. There is quality in quantity, and quantity in quality. The quantity of any product is the quantity based on a certain quality; the quality of any product is also manifested through a certain quantity. Under certain conditions, quantity may be the main aspect of the contradiction. For example, when the mass movement of great steelmaking in 1958 had just begun, many places did not produce steel or know how to make steel. Under such circumstances, "having is better than not having," and being able to produce one ton of steel or one ton of iron was a big step forward. Therefore, we once firmly defended the mass movement of great steelmaking and waged a resolute struggle against those "skeptics" and "head-shakers" who attacked the poor quality of indigenous iron and steel and attempted to suffocate the mass movement of great steelmaking. However, in more cases, the main aspect of the contradiction between product quantity and quality is quality. Even the "having" of "having is better than not having" refers to "having" with a certain quality. Although indigenous steel and indigenous iron are not as good as high-quality steel, they can still be used to manufacture indigenous machine tools, lay indigenous railways, and produce agricultural tools and small hardware products, and therefore have a certain quality. This is one. Secondly, for the production of any product, although quantity may be the main aspect of the contradiction at the beginning, as the quantity increases, quality will inevitably turn to the main aspect of the contradiction. This is the inevitable law of product production from rough to fine. Because the main aspect of the contradiction between product quantity and quality is usually quality, our principle must be to strive to complete and overfulfill the state-prescribed quantity targets on the basis of conforming to the national quality standards for each product.

Does emphasizing quality mean that quantity is not important? Of course not. This does not mean that the requirement for quantity can be ignored in the slightest. Under any circumstances, ensuring the completion of the state-prescribed quantity targets is the duty and glorious task of every worker in industrial and transportation enterprises. We propose high yield on the basis of conforming to quality standards, which also requires comprehensive fulfillment of the state's production plan. Our current task is to complete and overfulfill the production tasks for the third quarter on the basis of conforming to quality standards; to complete and overfulfill this year's sustained leap forward plan on the basis of conforming to quality standards! Everyone knows that if the quantity is large but the quality is poor, the actual significance of this quantity is very small. Similarly, if the quality is very good but the quantity is very small, it can only be used as a sample for exhibition, or can only be used by a few units, and the actual significance of this quality is also very small. We must have both high quality and high yield. Only focusing on quantity and not on quality, or only focusing on quality and not on quantity, is one-sided, and only sees the contradictory aspects of quantity and quality, but does not see the unified aspects of quantity and quality. We should master the dialectical law of quantity and quality well, conscientiously implement the principle of high yield on the basis of high-quality standards, strive for perfection, and strive to make one product worth several products, so that the material and human resources consumed in producing one product can produce several products. At the same time, on this basis of high quality, we should try every possible means to increase the quantity of products and strive to greatly increase production. This is the correct attitude.

Whether attention is paid to quality and how well quality is grasped is also an examination of whether the leadership style and work style are in-depth and down-to-earth. The leading comrades of some enterprises generally grasp the quantity targets of products relatively tightly, which is correct. But it is not correct if they do not grasp the quality targets so tightly. Whether our work style is in-depth and down-to-earth should not only be reflected in the completion of the product quantity, but also in the product quality. If the result of the work is that the quantity target is not completed, of course it is not good. If the quantity target is completed but the quality is very low, this is also not good. If we only pursue quantity and do not care about quality, it is even more a manifestation of only seeking false reputation and not seeking practical results in the work style. Only when the work goes deep into the quality and makes every product meet the quality standards, is this quantity solid, and even has greater significance in terms of quantity due to the improvement of quality; this work style is in-depth and down-to-earth.

How to grasp quality? In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, everyone has accumulated very rich experience in this regard. Here, I will only summarize a few points for your reference. That is:

First, we must grasp ideological work. From raw material enterprises to processing enterprises, from the first process to the last process, from cadres to every worker, we must establish the idea of "high yield on the basis of high quality." The quality of industrial products needs to be guaranteed one link after another. If the quality of raw materials is improved, the quality of processed products can be guaranteed; if the quality of the previous process is improved, the quality of the next process can be guaranteed. Only when everyone establishes the idea of high yield on the basis of high quality can we jointly improve the quality continuously.

Second, we must direct the spearhead of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement towards improving product quality. "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Improving product quality is closely related to improving the performance of equipment, ensuring the accuracy of tooling, improving process methods, and improving the level of operating skills. Concentrating the focus of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on these aspects, adhering to the principle of "boldly mobilizing the masses and experimenting with everything," and further improving the material and technical conditions of production will provide an important guarantee for improving product quality.

Third, we must establish and improve a set of rules and regulations to ensure product quality, and mobilize the masses to strictly implement them. There is a passage in "Mencius" that says: "Even with the skill of Gongshuzi, he cannot make squares and circles without compasses and squares; even with the wisdom of Shikuang, he cannot rectify the five tones without the six laws." Without certain rules and regulations, it is impossible to ensure the quality of products. Therefore, we must absorb the rich creations of the masses in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and reflect them in the enterprise's rules and regulations such as operating procedures and inspection systems, establish and improve mass-based production and inspection systems to ensure quality, and educate the broad masses of workers to move towards high quality and high yield.

If these three points are grasped well, and then a series of corresponding specific measures are grasped well, we will definitely be able to continuously improve product quality, and we will definitely be able to achieve high yield on the basis of high quality!

    精益求精优质高产
    我们通常所说的完成国家工业生产计划，都是指全面完成生产各方面的指标，要完成数量指标，要完成质量指标，要完成品种规格的指标，也要完成降低生产成本的指标。有些人常常把完成生产计划缩小为只是完成数量指标，这是不对的。在保证完成国家产品数量指标的同时，保证件件产品都是合乎规定的高质量，这从来是社会主义企业一条重要的经营方针。社会主义企业的优越性，不仅表现在产品的数量要超过资本主义的旧企业，而且表现在产品的质量也是第一流的。我们的产品质量，是一年比一年提高的。据上海市七个工业局的检查，在今年第一季度生产的二千一百多种产品中，有一千八百多种已经达到国内的先进水平，有些并且达到了国际上的先进水平，其中有二百三十多种产品的质量，原来是落后于先进地区的水平的，现在也赶了上来。这个材料可以代表当前全国产品质量的总趋势。但是，虽然如此，我们还要强调提高质量。这是因为产品质量的提高也是没有止境的。我们对待产品质量的根本态度，应该是不断革命，精益求精，好上加好。
    任何产品的质量，从来都不是抽象的，而是具体的，各种不同品种和不同规格的产品在不同的时期都有不同的具体的质量标准。产品的质量标准，总是根据每一个时期社会生产的发展需要和社会生产的水平制定的。比如，1885年，德国人本赤发明了世界上第一辆汽车。这辆汽车车体很重、速度很慢，但在当时说来，这也未尝不是一部让人满意的汽车。可是，今天又有谁会满足于这种质量的汽车呢？社会生产发展了，对产品质量的要求也就应该相应地提高。如果没有这种不断革命的思想，不是精益求精，好上加好，而是满足于既有的成就，浅尝辄止，整个社会生产的发展也就可能停滞不前了。
    现在，我国的社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的历史阶段。国民经济更好更全面的持续跃进，不但要求我们生产更多的工业品，而且要求我们的工业品质量比过去更好。拿工业支援农业的任务来说，在机械制造方面，过去几年中，主要是为农业生产一些新式农具和小马力的排灌机械，用普通质量的钢材也就可以了。现在，随着农业技术改造的开始，我们不但要继续大量生产各种新式农具，而且要生产更多的拖拉机、联合收割机和载重汽车等等；随着许多大中小型水利工程的建成，我们不但要大量生产小马力的排灌机械，而且要生产大马力的排灌机械。这些，就需要高质量的钢材了。而为了提高钢材的质量，就要提高钢的质量，为了提高钢的质量，又要提高铁的质量。这是一方面。另一方面，经过两年多的大跃进，我国工业生产的物质技术水平也已经有了很大的提高。广大职工的技术水平也已经有了显著的提高。因此，尽管我们的产品质量比过去更好了；但是根据我国社会主义建设事业发展的需要，根据我国工业生产已经达到的实际的技术水平，还需要提出更高的质量要求。当然，这种高质量的要求也并不是划一的，对不同的产品有不同的要求，如对造农具用的生铁和对铸造精密机械用的生铁，质量要求当然是不同的。但是总的说来，每种产品都应当是符合各自要求的质量最好的产品。这种高质量要求，是推动我国的社会主义建设事业不断发展的不可缺少的动力。
    不断地提高产品质量，是当前生产发展的新的形势向我们提出的任务，也是一个长期的方针。产品的数量和质量，是矛盾统一的两个方面。量中有质，质中有量。任何产品的数量，都是在一定的质量基础上的数量；任何产品的质量，也都是通过一定的数量表现出来的。在一定条件下，数量可能是矛盾的主要方面。例如1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动刚刚开始的时候，许多地方都不产钢铁，也不会炼钢铁。在这种情况下，“有比没有好”，能炼出一吨钢、一吨铁来也是前进了一大步。因此，我们曾经坚决地保卫过大炼钢铁的群众运动，同那些攻击土铁、土钢的质量不好、企图窒息大炼钢铁群众运动的种种“怀疑派”、“摇头派”进行过坚决地斗争。但是，在更多的情况下，产品数量和质量矛盾的主要方面，还是质量。即便是“有比没有好”的“有”，也是指具有一定质量的“有”。土钢、土铁虽然比不上优质量的钢铁，但是用于制造土机床，铺设土铁路、生产农具和小五金商品，还是能胜任愉快的，因而也是具有一定质量的。这是一。其次，任何产品的生产，尽管在开始的时候，数量可能是矛盾的主要方面；但是随着数量的增长，质量必然要转到矛盾的主要方面来，这就是产品生产由粗到精的必然规律。因为产品数量和质量矛盾的主要方面通常是质量，我们的方针必须是每种产品都要在合乎国家规定的质量标准的基础上，力争完成和超额完成国家规定的数量指标。
    强调抓质量，是不是说数量就不重要了呢？当然不是的，这丝毫不意味着可以忽视数量的要求。在任何情况下，保证完成国家规定的数量指标，是工业交通企业每一个职工的职责和光荣任务。我们提出在合乎质量标准的基础上高产，也就是要求要全面完成国家的生产计划。我们当前的任务是在合乎质量标准的基础上完成和超额完成第三季度的生产任务；在合乎质量标准的基础上完成和超额完成今年的持续跃进计划！大家都知道，数量很多，质量很差，这个数量的实际意义就很小。同样的，质量很好，数量很少，只能当做样品展览，或者只能供少数单位使用，这种质量的实际意义也很小。我们既要优质，又要高产。只顾数量，不顾质量，或者只顾质量，不顾数量，都是片面的，是只看到数量和质量的矛盾方面，而没有看到数量和质量的统一方面。我们应该很好地掌握数量和质量的辩证规律，认真贯彻在高质量标准的基础上高产的方针，精益求精，力争一件产品顶几件产品用，使生产一件产品所消耗的物力人力能生产出几件产品来，同时在这个优质的基础上千方百计地去增加产品的数量，力求大幅度地增产，这才是正确的态度。
    是不是注意抓质量，质量抓得怎么样，也是对领导作风和工作作风是不是深入踏实的一种考查。有些企业的领导同志，对产品的数量指标，一般说抓得比较紧，这是对的。但是对于质量指标抓得就不那样紧，这就不对了。我们的作风深入不深入、踏实不踏实，不仅应该表现在产品数量完成的情况上，还应该表现在产品质量的情况上。如果工作的结果，没有完成数量的指标，当然不好，如果数量完成了指标而质量很低，这也是不好的；如果只是去追求数量不管质量，那更是工作作风上只务虚名，不求实效的表现。只有工作深入到质量中去，使件件产品都合乎质量标准，这种数量才是实实在在的，甚至由于质量的提高而实际上具有更大的数量的意义；这种工作作风才是深入的、踏实的。
    怎样去抓质量呢？这些年来，特别是大跃进以来，大家在这方面都积累了很丰富的经验。这里，只概括提几点供大家参考。这就是：
    一要抓思想工作。从原材料企业到加工企业，从第一道工序到最后一道工序，从干部到每一个工人，都要树立“在优质的基础上高产”的思想。工业产品的质量是需要一环一环的保证的。原材料的质量提高了，加工产品的质量才有保证；上一道工序的质量提高了，下一道工序的质量才有保证。只有人人树立起在优质的基础上高产的思想，才能共同把质量不断提高。
    二要把技术革新和技术革命运动的矛头指向提高产品质量。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。提高产品质量同改善设备的性能、保证工卡具的精确度、改进工艺方法、提高操作技术水平，都有密切的关系。把技术革新和技术革命运动的锋芒集中到这些方面来，坚持“放手发动群众、一切经过试验”的方针，进一步改进生产的物质技术条件，就将使产品质量的提高得到重要的保证。
    三要建立和健全一套保证产品质量的规章制度，发动群众严格执行。“孟子”上有一段话说：“公输子之巧，不以规矩，不能成方圆；师旷之聪，不以六律，不能正五音”。没有一定的规章制度，是不能保证产品的质量的。因此，我们要吸取技术革新和技术革命运动中群众丰富的创造，把它反映到操作规程、检验制度等等企业的规章制度中去，建立和健全群众性的保证质量的生产制度和检验制度，教育广大职工向优质高产的方向前进。
    这三点抓好了，再抓好一系列相应的具体措施，我们就一定能不断地提高产品质量，一定能在优质的基础上高产！
