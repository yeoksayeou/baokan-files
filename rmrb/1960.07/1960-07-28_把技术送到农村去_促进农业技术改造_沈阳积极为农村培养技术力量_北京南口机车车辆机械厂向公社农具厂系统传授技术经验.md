Bringing Technology to the Countryside to Promote the Technological Transformation of Agriculture
    Shenyang Actively Cultivates Technical Strength for Rural Areas
    Beijing Nankou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Machinery Plant Systematically Imparts Technical Experience to Commune Farm Implement Factories
    According to Shenyang Daily, in the mass movement to support agriculture, factories in Shenyang actively help rural areas accelerate the cultivation of technical forces. They adopt two methods, "inviting up" and "sending down," to provide technical support to rural areas. The so-called "inviting up" means that the commune selects some young people to work as apprentices in factories to learn technology. Currently, 1,205 people have been trained for the communes in this way. The so-called "sending down" means that factories select technical workers to go to the commune's machinery repair shops, stationing there for a long time, teaching apprentices and imparting technology until they have mastered it. From the beginning of the year to the present, a total of 821 person-times have been dispatched, training 500 technical workers for the communes.
    The workers sent down from the factories settle in the people's communes, some providing long-term support for one year; others provide temporary support as needed by the rural areas. Under the unified leadership and arrangement of the commune, they adopt the method of one person teaching one apprentice or one person teaching several apprentices, participating in actual production operations while teaching the commune members technology.
    The leaders of various factories and enterprises attach great importance to training these "invited up" technical forces. In addition to assigning professional personnel from departments to be responsible for this work, they have adopted the method of "special teacher for special apprentice, guaranteed teaching and learning, learning while working, combining technical theory with practical operation" to accelerate the progress of training. Currently, some people have returned to the countryside and become the technical backbone of the commune's machinery repair shops, and most have reached the technical level of a first-grade worker. Their learning progress is generally three or four times faster than ordinary apprentices. The Shenyang Fan Factory trained 34 apprentices for the Xiushui River Commune in Faku County. In three months, 20 of them could operate machine tools to take shifts. After they returned to the commune, they rushed to produce 90 shovel plows in three days, which promptly met the needs of summer hoeing. In the past few months, the Shenyang Tianlixing Tool Factory has trained four technicians for the Fujia Commune in Tai'an County. Two of the lathe operators can now operate independently; a fitter can perform general machine repair work; and an electrician has also learned the knowledge of using indigenous methods to generate electricity and can operate various simple electrical equipment. Lu Zhenhe, a fitter, and Yin Zhenmin, a lathe operator, from this factory, also adopted the method of "rapidly training apprentices," breaking the general practice of apprentices learning skills in the past. They did not let apprentices do odd jobs, but focused on learning technology. They rushed to complete their daily production tasks and took time to teach their apprentices to do general work, while guiding and explaining from the side, which greatly accelerated the progress of training. Workers in various factories are very enthusiastic and conscientious about cultivating rural technical forces. They teach the structure, principles, and operating methods of machinery and equipment hand in hand, thus ensuring the quality of training.
    Through the above methods, factories in Shenyang have trained more than 1,700 technical workers for rural areas in the past six months. These technical workers have played a backbone role in the 90 commune machinery repair shops that have been established. Among them, 25 machinery repair shops have reached the technical level of medium repair, and the rest can also undertake small repair and simple farm implement manufacturing tasks.

    Xinhua News Agency reported that the Beijing Nankou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Machinery Plant, in its work to support the Shisanling Commune Farm Implement Repair and Manufacturing Plant, systematically imparted technology and experience to the Shisanling Commune Farm Implement Repair and Manufacturing Plant, helping workers learn to master machines and establish necessary management systems, so that the farm implement repair and manufacturing plant played its due role in accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Nankou Plant has organized technical support teams eight times to help the commune farm implement factory inspect machines and demonstrate technology, so that the farm implement factory workers understood the performance and maintenance methods of the machines they used, improved their operating skills, and solved some difficult problems in production.
    The technical support team that went to the farm implement factory was led by the secretary of the Party committee or the director of the Nankou Plant, and the team included management cadres, engineering technicians, and technical workers from various trades such as turning, fitting, forging, and welding. After each machine repair and technical demonstration, the workers of the two factories also held discussions to exchange experiences. Workers from the two factories have been linked up according to their trades and have established a fixed technical mutual assistance relationship. Any technical problems can be resolved in a timely manner through direct contact, which is very effective. Wang Jinliang, a welder at the farm implement factory, found that the welded joints were not strong after he changed to a new job, and they broke when he broke them by hand. He couldn't figure out what was wrong, so he went to the Nankou Plant to find Zhang Chunhua, the welder who was linked to him. Zhang Chunhua helped him improve the method of welding joints, and the problem of weak welding was successfully solved. The commune farm implement factory added a new six-foot lathe, but no one knew how to use it. The farm implement factory sent worker Li Qinghua to the Nankou Plant to specifically learn the technology of using a six-foot lathe. The Nankou Plant also assigned a special person to teach the technology in conjunction with actual practice. Li Qinghua was able to use the six-foot lathe after only two days.
    In order to strengthen the technical guidance force of the farm implement factory, the Nankou Plant also introduced Hou Shun, a retired veteran worker, to the farm implement factory to provide guidance. The casters of the farm implement factory originally only knew how to cast simple things like grate bars, and the scrap rate was relatively high. Under Hou Shun's patient teaching, many people's skills improved rapidly, and they were able to make some complex castings. Now Hou Shun has trained more than a dozen apprentices for this factory.
    With the help of the Nankou Plant, the farm implement factory worked hard and production developed rapidly. When the factory was built two years ago, the farm implement factory could only repair and manufacture small farm implements, and it could not use a machine tool. Now the farm implement factory has workshops for turning, fitting, casting, forging, wood, and repair. It can not only repair and manufacture small farm implements, but also repair large agricultural machinery and equipment such as automobiles, tractors, and boiler locomotives, and manufacture some improved farm implements. It is playing an increasingly important role in the technological transformation of agriculture. The Shisanling Commune used the land levelers they produced, and the land leveling efficiency increased four times.

    把技术送到农村去　促进农业技术改造
    沈阳积极为农村培养技术力量
    北京南口机车车辆机械厂向公社农具厂系统传授技术经验
    据沈阳日报消息　沈阳市各工厂在支援农业的群众运动中，积极帮助农村加速培养技术力量。他们采取“请上来”“派下去”两种方式，把技术支援给农村。所谓“请上来”，就是由公社选派部分青年，到工厂做徒工，学习技术，现已用这种方式为公社培训了一千二百零五人；所谓“派下去”，就是由工厂抽出技术工人下到公社的机械修配厂，长期驻在那里，以师带徒，传授技术，教会为止。从年初开始到目前，先后共派出八百二十一人次，为公社培训了五百名技术工人。
    从工厂派下去的工人，落户在人民公社里，其中有一部分为一年的长期支援；另一部分是根据农村需要随用随到的临时性支援。他们都在公社的统一领导与安排下，采取一人带一徒或一人带数徒的办法，一边参加实际生产操作，一边教给社员技术。
    各工厂企业的领导，对培训“请上来”的这批技术力量十分重视，除派科室专业人员负责这项工作外，都采取了“专师专徒，包教包学，边作边学，技术理论与实际操作结合”的方法，以加速培训的进度。目前已有部分人员回到了农村，成为公社机修厂的技术骨干，大部分达到了一级工的技术水平。他们的学习进度一般要比普通徒工快三、四倍左右。沈阳扇风机厂给法库县秀水河公社培训的三十四名徒工，三个月的时间，就有二十名可以操纵机床顶班作业，当他们回到公社之后，三天时间就赶制出九十台铲趟机，及时满足了夏锄的需要。沈阳天利兴工具厂，几个月来为台安县富家公社培训的四名技工中，有两名车工现在已能够独立操作；一名钳工可以作一般的机器检修工作；一名电工也学会了土法办电的知识，并能操纵各种简单电气设备。这个厂的钳工师傅吕振河和车工尹振民两人还采取了“快速带徒”的方法，破除了过去徒工学徒的一般惯例，不让徒工做零活，专心学技术。他们把每天的生产任务抓紧赶完，抽出时间教徒弟作一般的活，他们在一旁指导讲解，这就大大加快了培训的进度。各工厂的工人对培养农村技术力量都非常热心和认真负责。他们手把手地教授机器设备的结构、原理和操作方法，因而保证了培训的质量。
    沈阳市各工厂通过上述的几种方式，半年来已为农村培训了一千七百多名技术工人，这些技术工人在目前已建立的九十处公社机修厂中发挥了骨干作用。其中二十五处机修厂已达到中修的技术水平，其余的也能承担起小修和简易农具制造的任务。
    据新华社讯　北京南口机车车辆机械厂在支援十三陵公社农具修造厂的工作中，系统地向十三陵公社农具修造厂传授技术和经验，帮助工人学会掌握机器，建立必要的管理制度，使农具修造厂在加速农业技术改造中发挥了应有的作用。
    今年以来，南口厂曾先后八次组织技术支援队，到公社农具厂帮助检查机器，表演技术，使农具厂工人懂得了自己使用的机器的性能、维护方法，提高了操作技术，解决了生产中的一些疑难问题。
    到农具厂去的技术支援队，都是由南口厂的党委书记或厂长带队，队里包括管理干部、工程技术人员和车、钳、锻、焊等各工种的技术工人。每次检修完机器和表演完技术，两厂职工还举行座谈，交流经验。两厂工人按工种挂上了钩，建立起固定的技术互助关系，有什么技术问题，通过直接联系，解决得及时，收效又大。农具厂焊工王金良，换了新活以后，焊接处不牢固，用手一掰就断，他找不出毛病在那里，便到南口厂找和他挂了钩的焊工张春华。张春华帮助他改进了焊接接头的办法，焊接不牢的问题便顺利地解决了。公社农具厂新添一部六尺车床，没有人会使。农具厂便派工人李清华到南口厂专门学习使用六尺车床的技术，南口厂也指定专人结合实际教技术，李清华只经过两天时间就能够使用六尺车床。
    为了加强农具厂的技术指导力量，南口厂还介绍退休老工人侯顺到农具厂做指导。农具厂铸工原来只会铸炉条等简单活计，废品率比较高。在侯顺耐心传授下，许多人的技术迅速提高，一些复杂铸件也能做了。现在侯顺已给这个厂培养出十多名徒工。
    在南口厂的帮助下，农具厂穷干苦干，生产发展得很快。前年建厂的时候，农具厂只能修造些小农具，有一台机床也不会使用。现在农具厂已经有车、钳、铸、锻、木、检修等车间，不仅能修造小农具，还能修汽车、拖拉机、锅驼机等大型农业机械设备，制造一些改良农具。在农业技术改造中，发挥越来越大的作用。十三陵公社使用上他们生产的平土器以后，平土效率提高了四倍。
