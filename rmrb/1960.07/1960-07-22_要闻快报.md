　　Strengthening the Agricultural Front

　　The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to transfer 10,000 technicians and cadres to strengthen the agricultural front in three batches within three years. The first batch of 3,000 people to be transferred will be completed before the end of August. Among the cadres transferred this time, more than 80% are Party and League members, and about 50% are leading cadres at or above the district level. The technicians being transferred are all above level three, with independent operating and repair capabilities. In terms of trades, they are mainly fitters and turners, followed by electricians, internal combustion engine workers, and other trades needed in rural areas.

　　Overall Arrangement and Comprehensive Utilization

　　The Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized factories and enterprises throughout the city to cooperate and engage in diversified operations on a large scale. By-products that large factories can use are utilized by the factories themselves, and those that cannot be used are uniformly arranged by the city and assigned to factories in the city, counties, districts, and communes for local utilization. This has solved the raw material needs of some factories and promoted the development of production and diversified operations throughout the city.

　　Diversified Operations Included in Plans

　　The industrial, transportation, and construction departments of Gansu Province have incorporated diversified operations centered on increasing the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels into the state plan. This not only makes it easier to concentrate efforts on key issues at different times to achieve breakthroughs and promote an overall leap forward in production, but also allows for better utilization of human and material resources, truly making the best use of people's talents and materials. Through planning, leaders can also grasp things more meticulously, practically, and specifically.

　　Masses Running Power Stations Are Powerful

　　The mass power generation movement in Helingeer County, Inner Mongolia, has achieved great results. Currently, the county has built sixty small-scale hydro and hydroelectric power stations. According to the planned capacity of these sixty hydroelectric power stations, if used for processing for twelve hours a day, they can grind 720,000 jin of flour, saving more than 5,000 laborers; if used for lighting, they can provide electricity for 45,000 households.

　　Accelerating Loading and Unloading Speed

　　Workers at Shanghai Port, China's largest port, designed and manufactured more than 8,000 loading and unloading machines in the first half of this year, greatly improving the port's overall level of mechanization and significantly shortening the time ships spend in port. Before liberation, unloading coal required shovels and shoulder carrying; unloading coal from a 10,000-ton freighter required more than 200 workers working continuously for more than a week. Now, using a transportation line composed of grabs and belt conveyors, only twenty or so workers are needed to unload it in seven hours.

　　Collecting and Utilizing Wild Fibers

　　Qinghai Province has extremely abundant wild fiber resources, with an annual output of approximately 6 billion jin or more. People of all ethnic groups are actively engaged in the collection, processing, and utilization of wild fibers. Datong County and Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in Xining City, and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, among other places, have already used wild fibers to manufacture products such as rayon, native cloth, sacks, and ropes, and have begun to supply the needs of people's lives and industrial and agricultural production.

    要闻快报
    加强农业战线
    中共湖北省委决定三年内分三批抽调万名技术工人和干部加强农业战线。第一批开始抽调的三千人将于8月底以前完成。这次抽调的干部，80％ 以上是党、团员，区以上的领导骨干占50％左右。抽调的工人技术等级都在三级以上，有独立操作和修理能力，在工种上，主要是钳工、车工，其次是电工、内燃机工人以及其他农村需要的工种。
    统筹安排综合利用
    中共锦州市委组织全市工厂企业协作，大搞多种经营。凡是大厂能用的副产品就由本厂利用，不能利用的都由市统一安排，分别划给市、县、区、社的工厂，就地加以利用。这样，解决了某些工厂对原料的需要，促进了全市生产和多种经营的发展。
    多种经营纳入计划
    甘肃省工业交通和建筑部门，把以增产原料、材料、燃料为中心的多种经营纳入国家计划。不但便于在不同时期，围绕着关键问题，集中力量，重点突破，推动生产全面跃进，而且可以更好地发挥人力物力的作用，真正做到人尽其材，物尽其用。领导上通过计划，还可以抓得更细、更踏实、更具体。
    群众办电威力大
    内蒙古和林格尔县的群众办电运动，取得很大成绩。目前这个县已建成小型水力、水电站六十座。按这六十座水电站的计划能力，如果用于加工，每天十二小时，就可以磨面七十二万斤，节约劳力五千多个；用于照明，可供四万五千户照明用电。
    加快装卸速度
    我国最大的港口上海港的工人，今年上半年，自己设计与制造了八千多台装卸机械，使整个港口的机械化程度大大提高，船只停泊港口的时间也大大缩短了。解放前，卸煤用铁锹铲、肩膀抬，卸下一万吨货轮的煤炭，要用二百多工人连续卸一个多星期；现在采用了抓斗、皮带运输机组成的运输线，只要二十多个工人卸七个小时就能卸完了。
    采集利用野生纤维
    青海省野生纤维资源极为丰富，年产约六十亿斤以上。各族人民积极开展野生纤维的采集和加工利用工作。西宁市大通县、互助土族自治县和海南藏族自治州等地，已经利用野生纤维制造出人造棉、土布、麻袋、绳子等产品，开始供应人民的生活需要和工农业生产需要。
