　　Yesterday, people from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of China, held a grand rally to support the Cuban people in their opposition to US imperialist interference and to welcome the delegation from the Cuban Workers' Confederation. On behalf of the 650 million people, they strongly protested against US imperialist interference in Cuba and resolutely supported the Cuban people's just struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose US imperialist aggression.
　　Recently, the United States' interference and aggression against the Cuban revolution have become even more blatant and ferocious. Following the cessation of economic "aid" to Cuba and the disruption of Cuban oil production, the US government announced on July 6th that it would reduce Cuba's sugar import quota, once again putting pressure on Cuba. On July 9th, Eisenhower publicly stated that the United States would "not allow" the Cuban revolution to continue to develop. On July 11th, Eisenhower openly clamored for the overthrow of the Cuban government at a press conference. The United States is also actively planning to manipulate the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba. The increasing intensification of the United States' threats and aggressive steps against Cuba has greatly increased the tension in Latin America.
　　The United States' recent brazen reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota by 700,000 tons is the most vicious means by which the gold dollar empire attempts to wield its economic club and starve Cuba, fully exposing the ferocious face of US imperialism. In order to carry out insatiable plunder in Cuba, and also to keep Cuba under its control forever, making Cuba a single raw material supplier that only produces sugar cane, and making the vast majority of sugar cane produced in Cuba dependent on the US market, while most of the industrial and agricultural products needed by Cuba have to be supplied by the United States, the US monopoly capitalist groups seek huge profits from it, and completely control the economic lifeline of Cuba. In this way, the US monopoly groups can manipulate the gold dollar in their hands at any time, forcing the Cuban people to submit to their pressure. The United States used to buy Cuban sugar, but today it does not buy Cuban sugar; it used to supply Cuba with industrial and agricultural products, but today it refuses to supply Cuba with industrial and agricultural products, and neither is based on the interests of the Cuban people, but on the interests of the US monopoly groups. The so-called economic "aid" is also the same. Yesterday it was "aiding" you for aggression; today it stopped "aiding" you, also for aggression. US imperialism, like all imperialisms, completely subordinates its economic policies towards the plundered countries to its political aggression, but US imperialism is even more sinister in this respect. For imperialism, economic control and political enslavement have always been the two edges of a knife against oppressed peoples, and the two are inseparable. Therefore, all oppressed countries must resolutely get rid of imperialist economic control, expel imperialist economic forces, develop their own national economies, and get rid of dependence on imperialism in order to achieve true independence. On the contrary, whoever wants to rely on imperialist "aid" to develop their economy is bound to drink poison to quench their thirst, fall into the net of imperialism, and never be able to turn over.
　　After achieving revolutionary victory, the Cuban people firmly chose the path of breaking away from US economic control and relying on their own efforts. They resolutely implemented land reform, confiscating the land of foreign and domestic landlords in order to change the single-crop system, develop diversified agricultural operations, vigorously develop national industries, and restrict and gradually eliminate foreign economic forces; they developed trade with countries around the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in order to break away from the control of US monopoly capital. Of course, in doing so, the Cuban people are bound to infringe upon the interests of US imperialism, and are bound to be hated, sabotaged and obstructed by US imperialism, and therefore will inevitably encounter many difficulties. However, since the goal is revolution, to change the economic backwardness and dependence on imperialism caused by long-term imperialist aggression and plunder, how can it be easy and without difficulties? These difficulties are difficulties in the course of progress. What do these difficulties amount to compared with the guerrilla warfare they waged against US imperialism and its running dogs in the past! As long as they can rely on the initiative and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses of the people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The economic development that Cuba has achieved in a short period of time after the victory of the revolution, overcoming various obstacles, powerfully proves this point. For a country and a people determined to safeguard their independence, US economic pressure can precisely force them to strive for strength, strengthen unity, rely on their own efforts, and accelerate the development of their national economy. Bad things can turn into good things, and the Cuban people are deeply aware of this. The Cuban "Revolutionary Newspaper" recently pointed out that the economic aggression measures taken by the United States "only create conditions that will enable us to obtain our production diversification more quickly and resolutely. In this way, the conspiracies carried out by our enemies to overthrow us have become the force that stimulates us to achieve our ultimate goal." The Cuban government has decided to take more effective resolute measures to safeguard sovereignty and defend national resources to respond to the aggressive activities of US imperialism. The conspiracy of US imperialism to force the Cuban people to submit is doomed to failure.
　　The United States' adoption of measures to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota is also a vicious conspiracy to divide the unity of Latin American countries and isolate Cuba. After the US government reduced Cuba's sugar import quota, it also announced that it would purchase sugar from other Latin American countries to make up for this amount, and even used helping certain countries develop sugar cane fields and sugar industries as bait. The Mexican "Evening News" is right, "It is evil and foolish to think that reducing Cuba's sugar quota will be beneficial to Mexico." The United States is now also preparing to come up with so-called economic plans to "aid" Latin American countries in order to strike and isolate Cuba, so as to further strengthen its economic control over other Latin American countries. This deserves the serious vigilance of the people of all Latin American countries. Relying on its gold dollar power, US imperialism has always controlled the economic lifelines of Latin American countries, carrying out long-term enslavement and plunder of them. US imperialism is not only the enemy of the Cuban people, but also the common enemy of the people of all Latin American countries. Any conspiracy by US imperialism to divide the people of Latin American countries through despicable means of threat and enticement will be shattered by the increasingly awakened Latin American people who are fighting together and supporting each other.
　　The United States' economic threat to Cuba is obviously a prelude to its armed aggression against Cuba. The Washington authorities want to use crude economic pressure to create difficulties and chaos for Cuba, paving the way for its armed intervention in Cuba. At the same time, when this most effective "trump card" in the hands of the American interventionists is also lost, for them, there is only military adventure left. Recently, the United States has been actively planning to use the Organization of American States to carry out armed intervention in Cuba. Eisenhower openly stated in his statement on the 9th that the United States would take action against Cuba in accordance with notorious aggressive treaties such as the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. The US State Department even issued a statement that the United States would interfere in the internal affairs of American countries in accordance with the so-called "Monroe Doctrine." The reactionary politicians and propaganda machines in the United States have recently become even more rampant in clamoring for armed aggression against Cuba. New York Governor Rockefeller openly advocated that the US Marine Corps land in Cuba. This belligerent clamor full of gunpowder reflects the criminal intentions of the Washington ruling group. On July 14th, three US warships again opened fire within two nautical miles of the Cuban coast, destroying Cuba's territorial sea sovereignty and carrying out new military provocations. However, in the face of this tense threat from US imperialism, the Cuban people have neither been intimidated nor relaxed their vigilance. The Cuban people are uniting more strongly, waiting in battle array, ready to counter US imperialist armed aggression at any time. The massive anti-American demonstration of 500,000 people held in Havana on July 10 once again demonstrated the Cuban people's firm will to defend their motherland and oppose US aggression.
　　The Cuban people's just struggle is gaining more assistance, and it is receiving increasingly broad and firm support from the people of all countries. At the same time, the Cuban people's anti-American struggle has also powerfully supported the struggle of the people of all countries against US aggression and war policies and to defend world peace. Recently, as the conspiracy of the United States to interfere in the Cuban revolution has intensified, the movement of the people of all countries to support the Cuban people in their opposition to US interference has also been strengthened. Latin American publics have already shouted the battle cry of "Defending Cuba is defending Latin America." As Prime Minister Castro recently pointed out, "If they (the United States) sow the seeds of the wind of war on our revolutionary land, then they will reap the full anti-American storm throughout this (Latin American) continent." The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union firmly expressed its stand on the side of the Cuban people. Yesterday, the grand rally of people from all walks of life in Beijing to support the Cuban people, and the joint statement signed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Cuban Workers' Confederation, fully expressed the friendship and unity of the workers and people of China and Cuba in the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism. The Cuban people's just struggle can always count on the full support of the Chinese people. If US imperialism dares to launch an armed attack of this or that form on Cuba, the heroic Cuban people, with the firm support of the just people of the world, will surely be able to beat the US aggressors until they are bloody and battered.

### 英雄的古巴人民是不可战胜的

　　英雄的古巴人民是不可战胜的
    昨天，中国首都各界人民举行了隆重的支援古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉及欢迎古巴工人联合会代表团大会，代表六亿五千万人民，强烈抗议美帝国主义对古巴的干涉，坚决支持古巴人民维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    美国对古巴革命的干涉和侵略最近更加蛮横和凶恶了。美国政府继停止给古巴经济“援助”和破坏古巴的石油生产之后，7月6日又宣布削减古巴食糖进口定额，向古巴再一次施加压力。7月9日艾森豪威尔公开发表声明，表示美国将“不会容许”古巴的革命继续发展。7月11日艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上更露骨地叫嚷要颠覆古巴政府。美国并且积极策划操纵美洲国家组织进行对古巴的干涉。美国对古巴的威胁和侵略步骤的日益加紧，大大加剧了拉丁美洲的紧张局势。
    美国最近悍然削减古巴食糖进口定额七十万吨，就是金元帝国妄想挥动它的经济大棒，困死古巴的一个最毒辣手段，充分暴露了美帝国主义的凶恶面目。美国垄断资本集团为了在古巴进行贪得无餍的掠夺，同时也是为了永远把古巴置于自己的掌握之中，使古巴变成为一个只生产蔗糖的单一原料供应国，并且使古巴生产的绝大部分蔗糖要依赖美国的市场，古巴所需要的绝大部分工农业品则要靠美国供应。美国的垄断资本不但可以从中谋求巨额的利润，而且完全控制了古巴的经济命脉。这样美国垄断集团就随时能够摆弄它手里的金元，迫使古巴人民屈服于他们的压力之下。美国过去购买古巴的食糖，今天不买古巴的食糖；过去向古巴供应工农业品，今天拒绝向古巴供应工农业品，都同样不是从古巴人民的利益，而是从美国垄断集团的利益出发的。所谓经济“援助”也是如此。昨天“援助”你，是为了侵略；今天停止“援助”你，也是为了侵略。美帝国主义同一切帝国主义一样，它们对被掠夺国家的经济政策完全服从于它们政治侵略的目的，不过美帝国主义在这方面更加阴险罢了。对于帝国主义来说，经济控制和政治奴役从来是它们对付被压迫人民的一把刀子的两个刃口，二者是不可分的。因此，一切被压迫的国家要想取得真正的独立，必须坚决地摆脱帝国主义的经济控制，驱逐帝国主义的经济侵略势力，发展自己的民族经济，摆脱对帝国主义的依赖。相反的，谁如果想依赖帝国主义的“援助”来发展自己的经济，就必然是饮鸩止渴，堕入帝国主义的罗网，永远不得翻身。
    古巴人民在取得了革命胜利以后，坚定地选择了摆脱美国经济控制、自力更生的道路。他们毅然地实行了土地改革，没收了外国和本国大庄园主的土地，以改变单一作物制，发展农业的多种经营，大力发展民族工业、限制和逐步排除外国的经济势力；在平等互利的基础上发展同世界各国的贸易，以摆脱美国垄断资本的控制。当然古巴人民这样做，就必然要触犯美帝国主义的利益，就必然要遭到美帝国主义的仇视、破坏和阻挠，因而一定会遇到许多困难。但是，既然要革命，要改变由于帝国主义长期的侵略和掠夺所造成的经济落后、依附帝国主义的状态，怎么可能轻而易举、没有困难呢？这些困难是前进中的困难。这些困难比起他们过去反对美帝国主义及其走狗所进行的游击战争来，又算得了什么呢！只要能够依靠人民群众的积极性和革命热情，就没有不能克服的困难。古巴革命胜利以后，在短期间排除种种障碍所取得的经济上的发展，就有力地证明了这一点。美国对古巴的经济压力，对于一个具有维护独立决心的国家和人民来讲，恰恰可以迫使他们发奋图强，加强团结，自力更生，加速发展民族经济。坏事可以变成好事，古巴人民是深深认识这一点的。古巴“革命报”最近就曾指出，美国所采取的经济侵略措施，“只是造成了促使我们更快和更坚决地获得我们的生产多样化的条件。这样，我们敌人为打倒我们的所进行的阴谋活动，变成了刺激我们达到最终目的的力量。”古巴政府已决定采取更有效的维护主权和保卫本国资源的坚决措施来回答美帝国主义的侵略活动。美帝国主义想使古巴人民屈服的阴谋是注定要失败的。
    美国采取削减古巴食糖进口定额的措施，还是一项企图分化拉丁美洲国家的团结、孤立古巴的恶毒阴谋。美国政府削减了古巴食糖进口的定额之后，同时宣布要向拉丁美洲其他国家购买食糖来弥补这个数额，甚至以帮助某些国家发展蔗田和食糖工业，作为诱饵。墨西哥“晚报”说的对，“认为削减古巴食糖限额将对墨西哥有利，那是邪恶和愚蠢的”。美国现在还准备拿出所谓“援助”拉丁美洲国家的经济计划来打击和孤立古巴，达到它进一步加强对其他拉丁美洲国家经济的控制。这值得引起拉丁美洲各国人民的严重警惕。美帝国主义凭借它的金元势力，一直控制着拉丁美洲各国的经济命脉，对它们进行了长期的奴役和掠夺。美帝国主义不仅是古巴人民的敌人，也是拉丁美洲各国人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义想以威胁利诱的卑鄙手段，分化拉丁美洲各国人民的任何阴谋，必将被日益觉醒起来、共同斗争、互相支持的拉丁美洲人民所粉碎。
    美国对古巴的经济威胁，显然是它对古巴进行武装侵略的先声。华盛顿当局想用粗暴的经济压力来给古巴造成困难和混乱，为它对古巴进行武装干涉铺平道路。同时，当美国干涉者手上最得力的这张“王牌”也输掉了以后，对他们来说，就只剩下军事冒险一途了。最近以来，美国正积极策划利用美洲国家组织来对古巴进行武装干涉。艾森豪威尔在他9日的声明中公然表示，美国要根据里约热内卢公约等臭名远扬的侵略条约来对古巴采取行动。美国国务院甚至发表声明，美国要根据所谓“门罗主义”来干涉美洲各国的内政。美国国内的反动政客和宣传机器近来鼓吹武装侵略古巴的叫嚷更是十分猖狂。纽约州州长洛克菲勒公开主张美国海军陆战队在古巴登陆。这种充满火药气味的好战叫嚣，正是反映了华盛顿统治集团的罪恶意图。7月14日美国军舰三艘，又在古巴海岸两浬之内开炮，破坏古巴的领海主权，进行了新的军事挑衅。但是面对美帝国主义这种剑拔弩张的威胁，古巴人民既没有被吓倒，也没有放松警惕。古巴人民正在更加坚强地团结起来，枕戈待旦，随时准备着反击美帝国主义的武装侵略。7月10日在哈瓦那举行五十万人声势浩大的反美示威，再一次显示了古巴人民保卫祖国、反对美国侵略的坚强意志。
    古巴人民的正义斗争是得道多助的，它正在得到各国人民日益广泛和坚决的支持。同时，古巴人民的反美斗争，也有力地支持了各国人民反对美国侵略和战争政策、保卫世界和平的斗争。最近由于美国干涉古巴革命的阴谋日益加紧，各国人民支援古巴人民反对美国干涉的运动也更加加强。拉丁美洲公众已经喊出“保卫古巴就是保卫拉丁美洲”的战斗口号。正如卡斯特罗总理最近所指出的，“如果他们（美国）在我们的革命土地上散播战争之风的种子的话，那么他们将在整个这个（拉丁美洲）大陆上收割到全部反美风暴。”以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚决表示站在古巴人民一边。昨天，北京各界人民支持古巴人民的盛大集会，中华全国总工会与古巴工人联合会所签署的联合声明，更充分表达了中古两国工人和人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中的友谊和团结。古巴人民的正义斗争永远可以指望得到中国人民的全力支持。如果美帝国主义胆敢向古巴发动这种或那种形式的武装进攻，英勇的古巴人民，在全世界正义人民的坚决支持下，一定能够把美国侵略者打得头破血流。
