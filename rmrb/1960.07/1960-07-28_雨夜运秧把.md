	·Carrying Rice Seedlings on a Rainy Night·
	Night fell, and dark clouds gathered, threatening rain. At that moment, the cadres of the Caiqiao Brigade of the Caiqiao People's Commune in Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, were discussing the next day's rice transplanting tasks. To complete the next day's transplanting, they needed to transport the rice seedlings for more than ten mu of land to the transplanting site eighteen li away overnight. After calculating, they figured that at least 250 people would be needed to transport the seedlings, and with rain imminent, everyone was very anxious. This matter reached the commune's transportation management station. The staff at the management station all said: "The brigade is facing difficulties, how can we not support them?" So they immediately dispatched two wooden boats and seven flatbed carts to the brigade to help transport the seedlings. At this time, a drizzle had already begun to fall, and it was pitch black outside, with the dirt roads muddy and slippery. But everyone, regardless of the darkness and slippery roads, was focused on transporting the seedlings. Ge Youli, a flatbed cart worker, had traveled more than 100 li transporting goods during the day and had not yet rested, but he also came to help. By the time the seedlings were delivered, the east was beginning to brighten. Everyone's clothes were soaked, but their hearts were warm.

    ·雨夜运秧把·
    夜晚，阴云密布，又要下雨了。这时，江苏滨海县蔡桥人民公社蔡桥大队的干部正在研究第二天的插秧任务。要完成第二天的插秧任务，就要连夜把十多亩地的秧把送到十八里外的栽秧地点。大家算了一下，运送这批秧把至少要二百五十多人，天又要下雨，大家心里都很着急。这件事传到公社交通运输管理站。管理站的职工们都说：大队有困难，我们怎能不去支援呢？于是马上摇了两只木船，拉着七部平车，到大队帮助运秧把。这时，已开始下起毛毛雨来，外面是乌漆墨黑，泥路又烂又滑。可是大家不顾天黑路滑一心赶着运秧把。平车工人戈有礼白天运货跑了一百多里地，回来还没休息，也赶来帮助。当秧把送到时，东方已发白了，大家的衣服都湿透了，但是心里却是热呼呼的。
