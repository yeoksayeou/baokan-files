The Victory of the Mass Movement, the Victory of Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought
— Experiences in Creating and Performing the Folk Song and Dance Drama "Liu Sanjie"
Wu Jinnan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The legend of Liu Sanjie has been circulating in Guangxi for over a thousand years. According to legend, she lived during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of the Tang Dynasty. She was a young working woman, diligent, brave, intelligent, and beautiful, who was very good at singing and full of fighting spirit. Her songs "sang the hearts of the poor," like sharp daggers, piercing the hearts of the landlord class. Therefore, the rulers always tried their best to slander and distort her, while the working people regarded her as the embodiment of their wisdom and ideals, as a spokesperson against the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, praising and admiring her for thousands of generations, and honoring her as the "Singing Fairy." All over Guangxi, whether in minority areas or Han areas, there are legends and even various relics about her. From the folk song "Now Guangxi has become a sea of songs, all personally taught by Sanjie," we can know how great her influence was.

For such a heroic figure, the working people have wanted to bring her to the stage for many years, and have made many attempts, but this wish could only be realized in the era when the working people are the masters of the country, in the era of the Great Leap Forward. At the beginning of 1959, inspired by the slogan of presenting gifts for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, literary and art workers in Liuzhou took the lead in creating the first draft of the Cai Diao opera "Liu Sanjie," and immediately participated in the regional performance, which was well received. After many revisions, a more complete and mature third draft was created, which was warmly welcomed everywhere. After the Regional Party Committee made a decision in February this year to hold a regional "Liu Sanjie" performance, a mass movement of large-scale creation and performance was widely launched throughout the region. The momentum, scale, and far-reaching influence of this movement were unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics at the time of the regional "Liu Sanjie" performance in early April, a total of 1,209 literary and art units in the region, with more than 58,000 people, had performed "Liu Sanjie," including eleven types of operas, with an audience of more than 12 million, accounting for 60% of Guangxi's population. Among the performing units, amateur units accounted for 92%. On the basis of the performances in various regions, the Guangxi Autonomous Region "Liu Sanjie" performance was held in April. More than 1,400 people participated in this performance, using eleven types of operas.

Through this mass literary and art movement centered on the creation of "Liu Sanjie," not only was the quality of the "Liu Sanjie" script greatly improved, but also the mass amateur literary and art activities were greatly promoted, bringing Guangxi's literary and art work into a new stage. Various professional and amateur literary and art organizations have been generally established, a large number of new forces have emerged, the level of political thought and art has been improved, and the professional teams and the masses have been more closely integrated. In the movement, we deeply realized that the Party Committee must further strengthen its leadership over literary and art work; must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, oppose bourgeois literary and art thought, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act; literary and art work must adhere to the mass line and launch a large-scale mass movement.

I

The creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie" has received the cordial care and high attention of Party committees at all levels from beginning to end. The biggest feature of this opera is that it puts many folk songs on the stage and combines them with traditional opera art to express the character of Liu Sanjie as the "Singing Fairy." When we started doing this, some people held bourgeois prejudices, or had conservative ideas, or took a skeptical attitude. Some people thought that "Liu Sanjie" was "neither Cai Diao nor opera"; some thought that "folk songs are not dramatic language and are not very dynamic"... In short, there were quite a few people who belittled it and found fault with it. However, the responsible comrades of the Regional Party Committee, as well as the Prefectural and Municipal Party Committees, resolutely criticized this wrong thinking, and pointed out from the beginning that this opera has a broad mass base, that putting folk songs on the stage is a revolutionary initiative, and that we should work hard, carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and resolutely carry it through to the end. According to the intention of the Regional Party Committee, the Guangxi Daily published the full text of the third draft of the script, and organized six large-scale symposiums. Later, the Regional Party Committee made a special decision to hold a regional "Liu Sanjie" performance, calling on all localities to create and perform "Liu Sanjie" on a large scale, to raise the quality of the creation of "Liu Sanjie" to an advanced level, and to promote the great development of the mass literary and art movement in the region. The resolute support of the Party Committee greatly encouraged the creative enthusiasm of the masses, refuted bourgeois thought and conservative thought, and educated those who took a skeptical attitude with facts.

The Party not only supported this creation, but also provided regular, in-depth, and powerful guidance from the creative thought to the human and material resources, from the script to the performance, music, and stage design. Responsible comrades of the Regional Party Committee and the Party Committees of various prefectures, cities, and counties have personally watched the performance of "Liu Sanjie" many times, and not just generally watched it, but also put forward their opinions after watching it. Some Prefectural Party Committees also held special meetings to discuss the script and performance, and even repeatedly studied every line of the song, every tune, and every costume. Some Party Committee secretaries also personally went on stage to perform and direct on the spot. Many problems in the performance were solved by the Party Committee taking the lead. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, the regions, departments, and literary and art groups carried out communist cooperation, thus ensuring the smooth development of the movement and the continuous improvement of the quality of the performance. It is precisely because of the care and cultivation of the Party that the bud of "Liu Sanjie" can continuously obtain nourishment, bloom more and more brightly, and become more and more beautiful.

II

The mass literary and art movement centered on the creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie" was launched in close adherence to the Party's literary and art policy. The Party Committees in various localities used Mao Zedong's literary and art thought as a sharp weapon to overcome various bourgeois ideas and successfully solve the key problems in the movement.

First, we adhered to the principle of "making the past serve the present" and "political criteria first, artistic criteria second." During the creation process, some people once simply pursued "beauty" in form, only considering the beautiful scenery, gorgeous costumes, and pleasant lyrics, without asking about the theme, and even overemphasizing artistry and dramatic conflict, while lowering the theme, diluting the class struggle, damaging the character of Liu Sanjie, and weakening its due educational role. The Party promptly criticized this tendency, pointing out that art must be subordinate to politics, that historical themes must be combined with modern revolutionary requirements, and that to do a good job in the opera "Liu Sanjie," we must implement the policy of "making the past serve the present," first clarify the character of the characters, clarify the theme, and improve its fighting spirit, so as to better educate the people and serve today's socialist construction. To do this, we need to use the viewpoint of historical materialism to conduct scientific analysis and research on various materials. Due to the slander and distortion of the ruling class in the past, not only are there many dross in the written records about Liu Sanjie, but also some of the oral folk tales do not conform to the spirit of the characters. For example, saying that Liu Sanjie is a talented scholar-beauty type of female scholar, and blaming her death on her brother Liu Er, and shifting the struggle against the landlord class, is clear evidence. In the creation process, various localities have repeatedly studied these situations, carried forward the essence of the legends, and discarded the dross. And without violating the principle of historical authenticity, necessary development of the legends was carried out in order to better shape the character of the characters, to make the main line of class struggle clear and prominent, and to make Liu Sanjie and the masses closely related, resolutely resist the landlord class, and to concentrate and completely express the witty, brave, intelligent, and optimistic character of loving labor and loving life. The backward and conservative thinking that adhered to folk legends was criticized, and at the same time, the simplistic approach of anti-historicism was prevented.

Second, we adhered to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." We demanded that form should be subordinate to content, liberate our thinking, dare to think and dare to do, and boldly innovate and create. Inspired by this spirit, a large number of folk songs appeared on the stage, which played a great role in shaping the image of the Singing Fairy Liu Sanjie. Many of the lyrics are very wonderful. For example, when satirizing the landlord, they sing: "Don't boast about the rich landlord's wealth, the landlord's heart is more poisonous than a snake; if you wash your hands by the pond, the fish will die, if you pass by the green mountain, the trees will wither." When satirizing the scholar, they sing: "You talk about singing, I can do it too, you can soar into the clouds, I can fly; the wasp rests on the back of the turtle, if you dare to stretch your head, I dare to prick you." When describing love, they sing: "My sister misses you, my sister has a sincere heart, my brother knows it, the spider weaves a web at the mouth of the Sanjiang River, the water cannot break the true silk." "My brother misses you, my brother has a sincere heart, my sister also knows it, selling lotus root at the crossroads, every section is hollow and full of silk." Even "Even, we two will make friends for a hundred years, the one who dies at the age of ninety-seven, waits for three years on the Naihe Bridge."

Such folk songs, which have been tempered by the working people for thousands of years, are such beautiful literary languages! Many audiences and even poets have unanimously reflected that even if they don't watch the performance, just reading the lyrics in the script is a great artistic enjoyment.

However, when folk songs were first put on the stage and combined with Cai Diao, some people in the literary and art circles did not warmly welcome them. They said: Folk songs are not dramatic language and have poor dynamics; the drama absorbs folk songs, and the style is uncoordinated and inconsistent..., but this is just an excuse or a distortion of the facts. They look down on folk songs, thinking that folk songs cannot enter the hall of elegance; just as Comrade Mao Zedong criticized those petty-bourgeois writers for treating workers, peasants, and soldiers in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," they do not love the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not love their posture, and do not love their budding state of literature and art. Sometimes they openly despise them, and prefer the things of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and even the bourgeoisie. They are either conservative and unwilling to innovate and create, wanting the content to be subordinate to the form, rather than the form to be subordinate to the content, and they shout and scream when they see some development in traditional art forms. This is actually a kind of conservative thinking. At the same time, this attitude towards mass creation also shows that some literary and art workers lack a mass viewpoint, do not listen to the feedback of the masses, and only look at problems with their own prejudices. They do not understand that the reason why the opera "Liu Sanjie" is welcomed by the masses is because the image of Liu Sanjie is the ideal embodiment of the broad working people's resistance to the oppression and exploitation of the feudal ruling class, and is the spokesperson of the working people; it is because Liu Sanjie's mountain songs are loved by the masses. Of course, these ideas have been criticized by the Party and the masses. Liu Sanjie is a great folk singer, and without a large number of extremely exquisite folk songs, it is impossible to portray this character well. To use folk songs, we have to use the tunes of folk songs, which raises the question of how traditional stage art forms should be combined with folk songs. In solving this problem, we have always emphasized that the form should be subordinate to the content, and boldly innovate and create according to the needs of the content. Because it is innovation and creation, we should not observe it with old eyes; because it is innovation and creation, and it is something that predecessors have not done, it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings and immaturity. Therefore, we should affirm our achievements, believe that its direction is correct and its future is bright, and at the same time, enthusiastically support it and help it to move forward better, instead of being alarmed or even seizing on some temporarily existing shortcomings to negate everything. This is essentially a question of how to treat new things and how to treat innovation and creation in mass movements, and also a question of whether literary and art work should serve the masses. Facts have proved that after implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on these issues, not only have the folk songs themselves been greatly welcomed by the masses, but also the form has become coordinated and harmonious, and the expressive ability of traditional stage art has not been reduced or destroyed, but has been greatly strengthened. The most obvious is Cai Diao, which is a relatively young opera genre. In the past, there were fewer tunes and only some small-scale dramas were performed. Since the creation of "Liu Sanjie," it has absorbed a large number of folk song tunes, which has greatly improved its expressive ability. The argument that Cai Diao is not suitable for performing modern large-scale dramas in the past has been overturned by facts.

III

The creation of "Liu Sanjie" is also a victory for following the mass line and launching a large-scale mass movement. The process of the movement is the process of "from the masses, to the masses."

We know that the life and struggle of the people are the source of culture and art. This not only means that the life and struggle of the masses are an inexhaustible and inexhaustible source of rich themes for culture and art, but also that the masses have beautiful literary and art forms that are sufficient to express their life and struggle. Through this large-scale creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie," we have further realized that to promote literary and artistic creation, we must also launch a large-scale mass movement. And it has made us further realize that performing a play or singing a song must be integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the masses, and adopt content and forms that are popular and loved by the broad masses. In this way, the masses can easily accept it and receive good educational effects. The opera "Liu Sanjie" has achieved its current achievements by creating it in this spirit. Its story comes from the masses, the lyrics come from the masses, the tunes come from the masses, the dance comes from the masses, and the actors come from the masses. It can be said to be the most extensive collective creation of the masses. No matter which region or which troupe is creating "Liu Sanjie," they have absorbed a lot of nourishment from the folk through visits, discussions, and other methods, including stories, folk songs, tunes, and so on. The Liuzhou Cai Diao Troupe alone directly visited more than 100 old singers and held more than 30 discussions, collecting more than 192,000 folk songs. In the music creation, the Nanning Prefecture Cultural Troupe collected folk song tunes from all over Guangxi. Not only does the collection of materials rely on the masses, but also the masses directly participate in the creation. Many of the exquisite and humorous folk songs in the "Rejection of Marriage" scene in the revised version performed in Beijing were written by an old singer from Heng County.

After the opera was written, it was immediately taken to the masses, and opinions were widely solicited, and the wisdom of the masses was concentrated to revise it repeatedly. From workers, peasants, cooks, car drivers, and government cadres to university professors, they all regarded "Liu Sanjie" as "Guangxi's treasure," watching it again and again, and giving their opinions after watching it. Some even gave their opinions once, twice, or three times, so that almost every word and every sentence was condensed with the collective wisdom of the masses. The Liuzhou Cai Diao version has been revised more than 50 times before and after, and the draft of the song and dance drama in Nanning has reached more than 300,000 words. Some of them are major revisions, and sometimes even just changing one or two words or one or two sentences can bring new brilliance to the entire opera. The selection of actors is also the same. From the commune and county to the prefecture and autonomous region, selection was carried out at all levels. Some counties selected a group of the best actor candidates from each brigade and sent them to the commune, and the commune then selected the best ones to send to the county. In the county, the secretary of the county party committee and comrades from the literary and art departments personally selected them.

Because we followed the mass line and launched a large-scale mass movement, various operas and various professional and amateur troupes performed "Liu Sanjie," and then each prefecture and the autonomous region held performances, from which we concentrated the advantages of the script and performance, concentrated excellent talents, and further sorted out and improved. In this way, the entire opera took deep root in the masses.

The process of repeatedly sorting out, revising, and processing "Liu Sanjie" is also a process of combining popularization and improvement. Mass popularization provides a solid foundation for improvement, so the opera is getting better and better, and the improved "Liu Sanjie" is taken to the masses, which promotes greater popularization of the literary and art movement. On this issue, it once again proves that Chairman Mao's instructions on popularization and improvement are very correct.

The result of adhering to the mass line and launching a large-scale mass movement is not only the implementation of the spirit of the general line requiring more, faster, better, and more economical results, so that the opera "Liu Sanjie" has reached a higher level in just a few months, but also has quickly brought about the great prosperity of the mass literary and art movement, creating a new situation in Guangxi's literary and art work. Workers and peasants have come to the art stage one after another, making literature and art break through the circle of a few people and truly become a national cause. Many people who have never acted in operas or even rarely watched operas have also participated in the creation and performance, and many remote mountain areas have performed large-scale dramas for the first time from "Liu Sanjie."

After the creation and rehearsal of "Liu Sanjie," this young team has greatly improved its ideological and artistic level. On the other hand, professional literary and art workers have also received profound education in this movement. They are more convinced of the leadership of the Party, more convinced of the great power of mass movements and mass creation, and more convinced of the incomparable correctness of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. Many of them have actively and consciously plunged into the torrent of the mass movement to combine with the masses, learn from the masses, and at the same time give guidance to the masses, making valuable achievements.

Please see how powerful the mass movement is! The formation of a mass movement in literary and art work reflects the demands of the broad masses. In our socialist country, the working people are the masters of politics, the masters of nature, and also the masters of culture. Socialist culture and art belong to the working people. The people regard culture and art as their own cause. Especially in the past few years, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people's demands for cultural life have been increasing day by day. As long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, coupled with the efforts of literary and art workers, the mass movement can definitely be launched and will definitely bear fruitful results.

The victory of the mass literary and art movement centered on the creation and performance of "Liu Sanjie" in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a victory for the leadership of the Party, a victory for launching a large-scale mass movement, and a victory for Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. Of course, our work is still far from enough. The quality of "Liu Sanjie" needs to be further improved. The countless heroic deeds of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi in the Great Leap Forward still need us to work hard to reflect. We must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, learn from advanced regions, and strive to create more and better "Liu Sanjie" of the socialist revolution and socialist construction period, strive for a greater leap forward in Guangxi's literary and art cause, and strive to accelerate catching up with the level of advanced regions in the country!

    群众运动的胜利，毛泽东文艺思想的胜利
    ——创作和演出民间歌舞剧《刘三姐》的体会
    中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记处书记　伍晋南
    刘三姐的传说在广西已经流行一千多年了。相传她是唐中宗时候的人，是一个年轻的劳动妇女，勤劳勇敢，聪明美丽，很会唱歌，富于斗争精神。她的歌声，“唱出穷人一片心”，像犀利的匕首，刺进地主阶级的心窝。因而统治者总是极力诬蔑、歪曲她，而劳动人民则把她看作自己的智慧和理想的化身，看作反抗地主阶级的压迫和剥削的代言人，千年万代地讴歌她、敬仰她，尊她为“歌仙”。广西各地不论少数民族地区、汉族地区都有她的传说以至各种遗迹。从“如今广西成歌海，都是三姐亲口传”这首民歌里，就可以知道她的歌声有多么大的影响了。
    对于这样一个英雄人物，劳动人民多年来就想把她搬上舞台，也作过不少尝试，可是这一愿望只有在劳动人民当家作主的时代，在大跃进的时代才有可能胜利实现。1959年初，柳州市文艺工作者在向建国十周年献礼口号的鼓舞下，带头创作了彩调《刘三姐》第一次稿本，并随即参加全区会演，得到了好评。以后经过多次修改，又创作出了比较完善、成熟的第三次稿本，受到各地的热烈欢迎。今年2月，区党委作出了关于举行全区《刘三姐》会演的决定后，各地广泛掀起了大编大演的群众运动，这个运动的声势之大、规模之广、影响之深远，是前所未有的。到4月初举行全区《刘三姐》会演时的不完全统计，全区已经有一千二百零九个文艺单位共五万八千多人演出了包括十一个剧种的《刘三姐》，观众达一千二百多万人次，占广西人口60％。在演出单位中业余性质的占92％。在各专区会演基础上，4月举行了全自治区《刘三姐》会演。这次会演共有一千四百多人参加，用十一种剧种演出。
    通过这次以创编《刘三姐》为中心的群众文艺运动，不仅大大提高了《刘三姐》剧本的质量，而且大大地推动了群众业余文艺活动，使广西文艺工作跨进了一个新的阶段。各种专业的、业余的文艺组织普遍建立，新生力量大量涌现，政治思想水平和艺术水平得到提高，专业队伍和群众也更紧密地结合起来了。在运动中，我们深深体会到党委必须进一步加强对文艺工作的领导；必须高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，反对资产阶级文艺思想，发扬敢想敢做的革命精神；文艺工作必须坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    一
    《刘三姐》的创作和演出，从头到尾得到了各级党委的亲切关怀和高度重视。这个戏的最大的特点是把许多民歌搬上舞台，和传统的戏曲艺术结合起来，以表现作为“歌仙”的刘三姐的性格。当开始这样做的时候，有些人抱着资产阶级偏见，或者存在着保守思想，或者采取怀疑的态度。有的认为《刘三姐》“彩调不像彩调，歌剧不像歌剧”；有的认为“民歌不是戏剧语言，动作性不强”……总之，贬低它、挑它毛病的人是不少的。但是，区党委以至地委、市委负责同志坚决批评了这种错误思想，一开始就指出这个戏有广泛的群众基础，把民歌搬上舞台是一项革命创举，应该鼓足干劲，发扬成绩，克服缺点，坚决搞到底。根据区党委的意图，广西日报全文刊登了剧本第三次稿本，并组织了六次大型座谈会。以后区党委又专门作出了举行全区《刘三姐》会演的决定，号召各地大编大演《刘三姐》，把《刘三姐》的创作质量提高到先进的水平，并推动全区群众文艺运动大发展。党委的坚决支持，大大鼓舞了群众的创作热情，批驳了资产阶级思想和保守思想，用事实教育了那些采取怀疑态度的人。
    党不仅支持这一创作，而且从创作思想以至人力、物力方面，从剧本以至表演、音乐、舞台设计方面，都作了经常的、深入的、有力的指导。区党委和各个地、市、县委的负责同志都多次亲自观看《刘三姐》演出，而且不是一般地看，看了还要提出意见。有些地委还专门召开会议，讨论剧本和演出，甚至对每一句唱词、每一个曲调、每一件服装也反复地研究。有的党委书记还亲自登台演出，临场导演。演出中的许多问题都是由党委挂帅解决的。在党委的统一领导下，各地区、各部门、各文艺团体之间，实行了共产主义大协作，从而保证了运动的顺利开展和演出质量的不断提高。正是党的关怀和栽培，《刘三姐》这朵蓓蕾才能不断地获取养料，开得一天比一天鲜艳，一天比一天美丽。
    二
    以《刘三姐》编演活动为中心的群众文艺运动，是紧紧遵循着党的文艺方针开展起来的。各地党委运用毛泽东文艺思想这一锐利的武器，战胜了形形色色的资产阶级思想，胜利地解决了运动中的各个关键问题。
    首先，坚持了“古为今用”和“政治标准第一，艺术标准第二”的原则。在创作过程中有些人曾经单纯追求形式上的“美”，只考虑布景漂亮、服装华丽、歌词动听，而不问主题思想，甚至过份强调艺术性和戏剧冲突，而降低了主题思想，冲淡了阶级斗争，损害了刘三姐的人物性格，减弱了它应有的教育作用。党及时批判了这种倾向，指出艺术必须从属于政治，处理历史题材必须和现代革命要求结合起来，搞好《刘三姐》这个戏必须贯彻“古为今用”的方针，首先弄清人物性格，明确主题思想，提高它的战斗性，从而更好地教育人民，为今天的社会主义建设服务。为了做到这一点，就需要以历史唯物主义的观点对各种资料进行科学的分析研究。由于历代统治阶级的诬蔑、歪曲，不仅关于刘三姐的文字记载有许多糟粕，就是民间口头传说也有一些是不符合人物精神面貌的。比如把刘三姐说成才子佳人式的女秀才，把她的死归罪于哥哥刘二，而转移了对地主阶级的斗争，就是明证。各地在创作过程中对于这些情况都反复地作了研究，发扬了传说中的精华，扬弃了其中的糟粕。并且在不违背历史真实的原则下，对传说进行了必要的发展，以更好地塑造人物性格，使阶级斗争的主线鲜明、突出，使刘三姐和群众血肉相关，坚决反抗地主阶级，以及热爱劳动、热爱生活等等机智、勇敢、聪慧、乐观的性格得到集中的完整的表现。那种拘泥于民间传说的落后保守思想受到了批判，同时也防止了反历史主义的简单化的做法。
    其次，坚持贯彻了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针。要求形式服从内容，解放思想，敢想敢做，大胆革新创造。在这个精神的鼓舞下，大量的民歌登上了舞台，这对塑造歌仙刘三姐的形象起了很大作用。有许多歌词是十分精彩的。比如讽刺地主时唱的：“莫夸财主家豪富，财主心肠比蛇毒；塘边洗手鱼也死，路过青山树也枯。”在讽刺秀才时唱的：“你讲唱歌我也会，你会腾云我会飞；黄蜂歇在乌龟背，你敢伸头我敢锥。”在描写爱情时唱的：“妹相思，妹有真心哥也知，蜘蛛结网三江口，水冲不断是真丝。”“哥相思，哥有真心妹也知，十字街头卖莲藕，节节空心都是丝。”连“就连，我俩结交订百年，
    那个九十七岁死，奈何桥上等三年。”
    像这样一些经过劳动人民千锤百炼的民歌，是多么优美的文学语言！许多观众以至诗人看了都一致反映，不看演出，只看剧本中的歌词也是很大的艺术享受。
    可是，民歌刚一搬上舞台和彩调结合起来的时候，文艺界有些人并不是热情欢迎的，他们说：民歌不是戏剧语言，动作性差；戏剧吸取民歌，风格不协调，不统一……，其实这不过是借口或对事实的歪曲。他们看不起民歌，认为民歌登不了大雅之堂；正如毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中批评那些小资产阶级作家对待工农兵群众那样，不爱工农兵的感情，不爱他们的姿态，不爱他们的萌芽状态的文艺。有时就公开地鄙弃它们，而偏爱小资产阶级知识分子的乃至资产阶级的东西。他们或者因循守旧，不愿意革新创造，要内容服从形式，而不是形式服从内容，看到传统的艺术形式有一些发展就大喊大叫，这实际上是一种保守思想。同时在这种对待群众创作的态度中，也表现了某些文艺工作者缺乏群众观点，不听群众反映，只凭自己的偏见去看问题。他们不懂得《刘三姐》这个戏之所以受群众欢迎，就是因为刘三姐这个人物形象，是广大劳动人民反抗封建统治阶级的压迫和剥削的理想的化身，是劳动人民的代言人；就是因为刘三姐的山歌为群众所喜闻乐见。当然，这些思想受到了党和群众的批评。刘三姐是伟大的民间歌手，没有大量极为精美的民歌就无法刻划好这个人物，要运用民歌就得运用民歌的曲调，这就产生传统的舞台艺术形式如何和民歌结合的问题。在解决这个问题时，我们始终强调了形式要服从内容，根据内容的需要，进行大胆的革新创造。因为是革新创造，就不应该用旧眼光来观察；因为是革新创造，是前人没有做过的，就难免有一些缺点和不成熟之处。所以，应该肯定成绩，相信它方向正确，前途远大，同时又满腔热情地扶植它，帮助它更好地前进，而不应该大惊小怪，甚至抓住暂时存在的一些缺点否定一切。这实质上是一个如何对待新生事物、如何对待群众运动中的革新创造的问题，也是文艺工作要不要为群众服务的问题。事实证明，执行了毛泽东同志在这些问题上的指示后，不仅民歌本身受到了群众的极大欢迎，而且在形式上也显得协调、和谐，传统的舞台艺术的表现能力不是降低了、破坏了，而是大大地加强了。最明显的是彩调，这是一个比较年青的剧种，以前曲牌较少，只演过一些小型剧目，自从创编《刘三姐》后，吸取了大量民歌曲调，大大提高了表现能力。过去认为彩调不宜于演现代大型剧目的论调已经被事实推翻了。
    三
    《刘三姐》的创作也是走群众路线、大搞群众运动的胜利。运动的过程就是“从群众中来，到群众中去”的过程。
    我们知道，人民群众的生活和斗争是文化艺术的源泉。这不仅说群众的生活和斗争是文化艺术取之不尽、用之不竭的丰富题材，而且群众中有优美的足以表达他们生活和斗争的文艺形式。通过这次大编大演《刘三姐》，我们进一步认识到，繁荣文艺创作，也必须大搞群众运动。而且使我们进一步认识到，演一出戏、唱一首歌，都必须和群众的思想感情融合起来，采用通俗的为广大群众所喜闻乐见的内容和形式。这样，群众才易于接受而收到良好的教育作用。《刘三姐》这个戏就是本着这样一个精神去创作才取得现有的成就的。它的故事来自群众，歌词来自群众，调子来自群众，舞蹈来自群众，演员来自群众，可以说是最广泛的群众集体创作。不论哪一个地区、哪一个剧团在创作《刘三姐》时都通过访问、座谈等等方式，从民间吸取了大量的养料，包括故事、民歌、曲调等等。仅柳州市彩调团直接访问过的老歌手就有一百多人，召开的座谈会达三十多次，收集了十九万二千多首民歌。南宁专区文工团在音乐创作中，把全广西各地的民歌曲调都收集起来了。不仅材料的收集依靠群众，而且群众直接参加了创作，来京演出的整理本中“拒婚”那一场许多精美、幽默的民歌就是横县一位老歌手写的。
    戏写出来以后，立即拿到群众中去，广泛征求意见，集中群众的智慧来反复修改。从工人、农民、炊事员、汽车司机、机关干部到大学教授都把《刘三姐》看成“广西的宝贝”，一次再次地看，看了提出意见，有的甚至一次二次三次地提，因而几乎每字每句都凝结着群众的集体智慧。柳州彩调本前后修改达五十次以上，南宁的歌舞剧剧本草稿达三十多万字。其中有些是大改，有时虽只改动一两个字、一两句话，却给整场戏带来了新的光彩。演员的选择也是如此。从公社、县以至专区、自治区都层层进行了选拔。有的县由各大队选拔一批最好的演员对象送到公社，公社再选最好的送到县，县里由县委书记和文艺部门的同志亲自挑选。
    由于走群众路线，大搞群众运动，各个剧种、各个专业、业余剧团都演《刘三姐》，然后各专区和自治区都举行会演，从会演中集中剧本、演出方面的优点，集中优秀的人材，进一步整理提高。这样就使得整个戏在群众中深深地扎下了根子。
    《刘三姐》反复地进行整理、修改和加工的过程，也是普及和提高相结合的过程。群众性的普及为提高提供坚实的基础，所以戏越改越好，而提高了的《刘三姐》拿到群众中去，又推动了文艺运动的更大的普及。在这个问题上，又一次证明了毛主席关于普及和提高的指示是十分正确的。
    坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动的结果，不仅贯彻了总路线要求的多快好省的精神，使《刘三姐》这出戏在短短几个月内达到了较高的水平，而且迅速地带来了群众文艺运动的大繁荣，开创了广西文艺工作的新局面。工人、农民纷纷登上艺术舞台，使文艺突破少数人的圈子，真正成了全民性的事业。许多从来没有演过戏甚至很少看戏的人也参加了创作和演出，许多偏僻山区从《刘三姐》开始第一次自己排演了大型剧目。
    这批年轻的队伍经过《刘三姐》的创作和排练，大大提高了思想水平和艺术水平。另一方面，专业文艺工作者也在这次运动中受到了深刻的教育，他们更加信服党的领导了，更加信服群众运动和群众创作的伟大力量了，也更加信服毛泽东文艺思想的无比正确了。他们之中许多人已经积极地自觉地投入到群众运动的洪流中去和群众结合，向群众学习，同时给群众以辅导，做出了可贵的成绩。
    请看群众运动具有多么大的威力！文艺工作形成群众性的运动是反映了广大群众的要求。在我们社会主义国家里，劳动人民是政治上的主人，是自然的主人，也是文化的主人。社会主义的文化艺术，是属于劳动人民的，人民群众把文化艺术作为自己的事业，特别是几年来工农业生产大跃进，人民群众对文化生活的要求日益增长，只要加强党的领导，加上文艺工作者的努力，群众运动就一定可以搞起来，而且一定会结出丰硕的果实。
    广西僮族自治区以编演《刘三姐》为中心的群众文艺运动的胜利是党的领导的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利。当然，我们的工作还做得很不够，《刘三姐》的质量还需要进一步提高，广西各族人民大跃进中的无数英雄业迹还有待我们去努力反映，我们一定要高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，向先进地区学习，争取创作出更多更好的社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期的《刘三姐》来，争取广西文艺事业更大的跃进，争取加速赶上全国先进地区的水平！
