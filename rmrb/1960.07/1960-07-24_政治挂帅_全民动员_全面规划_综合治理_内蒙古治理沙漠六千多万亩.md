Inner Mongolia Governs Over 60 Million Mu of Desert

(Our dispatch) The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are engaged in a great and magnificent undertaking to green the desert and transform nature.

Rolling sands have been regarded as an unchangeable and unrestrained force of nature since ancient times, seriously affecting the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and the improvement of people's lives. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, after about ten years of struggle, have made large areas of the desert begin to don green clothes, many semi-fixed deserts have been fixed, and new patches of green and green belts have appeared in the heart of the "sand sea." By the end of May this year, Inner Mongolia had governed more than 60 million mu of desert, and about 16% of the "sand sea" had been subdued. On the southeastern edge of the Ulan Buh Desert in Bayannur League, a 190-kilometer-long and 350-meter-wide sandbreak forest and a 5-kilometer-wide grass belt have formed a green Great Wall, preventing the eastward invasion of quicksand, reclaiming more than 400,000 mu of farmland from the desert, and protecting more than 1 million mu of pasture from wind and sand damage. The Kubuqi and Maowusu deserts within the territory of the Ikezhao League are being divided and surrounded, and more than 3.11 million mu of woodland have been created in the past few years. Xinfeng First Cooperative of Xinmiao Township, Hangjin Banner, has transformed more than 20,000 mu of desert into fertile land through afforestation, sand barriers, and water irrigation, turning 1,800 mu of quicksand into good farmland. The task of building 30 million mu of shelterbelts originally planned in the thirteen banners and counties with severe wind and sand disasters in eastern Inner Mongolia has been nearly half completed, and the initially formed shelterbelts have begun to exert their power. In many places, the trees are lush and have played a role in preventing wind and sand, ensuring bumper harvests, and reducing natural disasters. The masses praised and said: "In the past, wind and sand covered the sky, and we had little to eat and wear; now the mountains are green and the water is clear, and we have no worries about food and clothing."

In transforming the desert, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has thoroughly implemented the policy of Party committee leadership, putting politics in command, mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people, focusing on mass prevention and control, combining the key governance of national modernized equipment, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive governance, etc., taking "two legs to walk." At present, the three major leagues in the main desert areas, Bayannur, Ikezhao, and Xilingol, have established more than 720 community (team)-run forest farms, professional teams, and nurseries, and trained more than 6,500 commune desert control technicians, with about 10,000 fixed forestry personnel. Every spring and autumn, hundreds of thousands of people of all ethnic groups are invested in the desert control movement. In sparsely populated desert areas, the state has established 31 desert control work stations and 10 sandbreak forest farms, which work in the desert all year round. Last year, with the strong cooperation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, fraternal provinces and regions, and relevant units, Inner Mongolia established a desert control scientific research network and a desert survey and design team with the Bayangol City Desert Control Comprehensive Experimental Station as the core. After more than a year of efforts, the situation of the desert area has been basically clarified, providing a reliable basis for the future transformation and utilization of the desert.

This year, Inner Mongolia's desert transformation work has been progressing rapidly and vigorously, and a mass desert control upsurge has been formed in various places. Since the beginning of spring, more than 200,000 people have launched a shock afforestation campaign along the edges of the three major deserts, Ulan Buh, Maowusu, and Kubuqi, and have begun to create three large-scale green Great Walls. Large-scale sand sealing and grass planting work is being carried out in the desert areas. People of all ethnic groups and employees of state-owned desert control institutions are riding horses and camels to sow a large area of grass seeds and tree species in the desert. Aircraft sowing work has now begun. So far, the region has built more than 1.3 million mu of sand-fixing forests, planted 2 million mu of grass in the desert, and sealed 4.5 million mu of sand for forest cultivation. The desert survey and design team entered the desert area in April and began surveying and measuring 2.13 million hectares of desert and 200 kilometers of railway line shelterbelts. (Mao Chunli)

    政治挂帅　全民动员　全面规划　综合治理
    内蒙古治理沙漠六千多万亩
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区各族人民正在进行着绿化沙漠、改造自然的伟大、壮丽的事业。
    滚滚流沙，自古被视为不可改变，不受约束的自然力量，严重影响工农牧业的发展和人民生活的提高。内蒙古各族人民在共产党的领导下，历经十年左右的搏斗，已使大面积沙漠开始披上了绿装，不少半固定沙漠被固定，“瀚海”腹地也出现了新的翠斑和绿带。到今年5月底，内蒙古已治理了六千多万亩沙漠，16％左右的瀚海已经被制服。在巴彦淖尔盟乌兰布和沙漠的东南边缘，一条一百九十公里长、三百五十米宽的防沙林与五公里宽的草带结成了绿色长城，阻止了流沙的东侵，并向沙漠夺回四十多万亩农田，保护住一百多万亩牧场免受风沙侵害。伊克昭盟境内的库布齐和毛乌素两大沙漠，正被分割、包围，几年内已经营造成三百十一万多亩林地。仅杭锦旗新庙乡新丰一社就通过造林、埋设沙障、引水灌沙等办法改造沙漠两万多亩，使一千八百亩流沙变成了良田。内蒙古东部风沙灾害严重的十三个旗、县，原订营造防护林三千万亩的任务，已接近完成一半，初步形成的防护林带已开始发挥威力。很多地方绿树成荫，起到了防风沙、保丰收、减少自然灾害的作用。群众赞美说：“过去是风沙遮天，少吃没穿；现在是山青水秀，吃穿不愁”。
    内蒙古自治区在改造沙漠中，深入贯彻执行了党委领导，政治挂帅，全党全民动员，以群众性的普遍防治为主，结合国家现代化设备的重点治理、全面规划、综合治理等“两条腿走路”的方针。现在，主要沙漠地带巴彦淖尔、伊克昭、锡林郭勒等三个盟，已建立七百二十多处社（队）办林场、专业队和苗圃等治沙机构，培训了六千五百多名公社治沙技术人员，固定的林业人员约一万多人。每到春、秋两季，投入治沙运动的各族人民达几十万人。在人烟稀少的沙漠地区，国家建立了治理沙漠工作站三十一处，防沙林场十处，常年在沙漠中进行工作。去年，在中国科学院、兄弟省区和有关单位的大力协作下，内蒙古建立起以巴彦高勒市治沙综合试验站为核心的治沙科学研究网和一支沙漠勘察设计队伍。经过一年多的努力，基本上摸清了全区沙漠的情况，为今后改造利用沙漠提供了可靠的依据。
    今年，内蒙古改造沙漠的工作进度快、来势猛，各地相继形成了群众性的治沙高潮。入春以来，有二十多万人沿着乌兰布和、毛乌素、库布齐等三大沙漠的边缘展开了突击造林运动，开始缔造三条规模巨大的绿色长城。大面积的封沙种草工作，正在各沙漠区紧张进行着。各族人民和国营治沙机构的职工，骑着马、骆驼，在沙漠上播种了大面积的草籽树种。飞机播种工作现已开始。到目前为止，今年全区已经营造固沙林一百三十多万亩，在沙漠中种草二百万亩，封沙育林四百五十万亩。沙漠勘察设计队伍在4月份进入沙漠区，开始了二百十三万公顷沙漠和二百公里铁路线防护林带的勘察测量工作。（毛纯礼）
