Xinhua News Agency, July 24th. Brussels Dispatch: Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny, who attended the United Nations Security Council discussion on the Congo situation and returned to the Belgian capital yesterday, said that he was satisfied with the actions of the American representative in the Security Council. He said, "I am satisfied that the Americans finally told the Soviets what they thought of the Congo."

Wigny said, "We have friends who support us," and the "accusations" against us were "refuted by everyone—except, of course, the Communists." News from the Congo indicates that Belgian colonialists are actively planning to continue the occupation of Congo's Katanga province by their invading forces, also under the cover of the UN flag. Linden, the Belgian government's "special envoy" to Katanga province, said in Elisabethville yesterday that Belgian authorities are discussing with the UN headquarters a plan to keep Belgian troops in Katanga province as "a UN force." He emphasized, "It still seems possible now."

At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Weber, the military advisor to the separatist Katanga Province Governor Tshombe, also bluntly stated that Belgian troops would remain there under the name of the UN forces. Weber said at a press conference, "Belgium is also a member of the United Nations, and these (Belgian) troops can just paint their helmets blue."

Weber also said that Belgian troops will remain in Katanga as long as it is "necessary."

    比殖民者阴谋在联合国旗帜下分裂刚果
    比军谋划占领加丹加省
    新华社24日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：出席联合国安全理事会讨论刚果局势后回到比利时首都的比利时外交大臣维尼昨天说，他对美国代表在安理会的作法感到满意。他说：“我感到满意的是：美国人最后告诉了苏联人，他们对刚果有什么看法。”
    维尼说：“我们有朋友支持我们”，我们受到的“指责遭到了大家——当然共产党人除外——的驳斥”。来自刚果的消息表明，比利时殖民主义者正在积极谋划也在联合国旗帜的掩护下，使它的侵略军队继续占领刚果的加丹加省。加丹加省的比利时政府“特使”林登昨天在伊利沙伯维尔说，比利时当局正在同联合国总部讨论让比利时军队作为“一支联合国部队”而留在加丹加省的计划。他强调说：“现在看来还是可能的。”
    同时，闹分裂的加丹加省省长冲伯的军事顾问韦伯中校也露骨地表示，比利时军队将顶替联合国军名义留在那里。韦伯在记者招待会上说，“比利时也是联合国会员国，这些（比利时）军队把他们的钢盔漆上蓝色就成了。”
    韦伯还说，比利时军队只要有“必要”，就要一直留在加丹加。
