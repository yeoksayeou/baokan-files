　　Sichuan
　　(Our Chongqing dispatch, July 1st) The medium and small iron mines in Sichuan Province, focusing on the key to production, have launched a mass technical revolution, resulting in a continuous leap forward in ore production and quality. Many blast furnaces have achieved a state of being well-fed and having "surplus grain."
　　In order to ensure sustained high steel production, medium and small iron mines in Sichuan Province have, since the second quarter, directed the spearhead of the technical revolution towards the weak links of production: the excavation and transportation bottlenecks. In excavation, various mines have implemented the spirit of self-reliance and relying mainly on local resources as required by the Provincial Party Committee, vigorously developing local explosives, local detonating cords, and local blasting caps, greatly accelerating mining and excavation speed.
　　Many medium and small iron mines, in order to solve the weak link of transportation, are generally implementing "three improvements" in underground transportation: first, improve the tunnels (straighten bends, enlarge small tunnels); second, improve the tracks (increase passing lanes, change single tracks to double tracks); and third, improve the cars (change small cars to large cars, change single cars to trains). At the Dachanggou mining area of the Baolunyuan Iron Plant in Guangyuan County, the establishment of a linked line for ore downhill transport has reduced the labor force responsible for ore downhill transport by 90%, and the amount of ore transported downhill has doubled. In the past, it was necessary to purchase some ore from other factories to ensure the needs of the blast furnace. Now, not only is self-sufficiency achieved, but there is also some surplus.

　　Shandong
　　(Our Jinan dispatch, July 1st) The mass movement for technical transformation centered on improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the mine system of Shandong Province is gradually expanding, and its effects are becoming increasingly significant. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the province's mines has greatly increased compared to the beginning of this year, and the daily ore production level has increased by 33% compared to February. Due to the increase in ore production, steel units throughout the province have achieved an average of thirteen days of ore reserves.
　　In order to significantly increase the ore production level, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all mines in March this year to fully promote the spirit of self-reliance, adhere to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and accelerate the technical transformation of mines.
　　Because the direction of the transformation is clear, the emphasis is on key points in the specific arrangements, taking into account the general situation, and with the strong support of relevant departments, the transformation work has progressed rapidly.

　　Jiangsu
　　(Our Nanjing dispatch, July 1st) Through technical transformation, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in small iron mines in Jiangsu has been greatly improved, basically eliminating the heavy manual labor of carrying loads on shoulders and manual drilling. In the first half of the year, with a nearly 60% reduction in personnel, iron ore production increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year. The output of small iron mines now accounts for one-third of the province's total ore output.
　　There are currently eighteen small iron mines in Jiangsu Province. Since the beginning of this year, under the unified leadership of the Provincial Metallurgical Department, a technical transformation plan has been formulated, focusing on transportation, mining equipment, and power transmission projects inside and outside the mines as the key areas for technical transformation.
　　In the process of mine technical transformation, in addition to relying on the Provincial Metallurgical Department to allocate some major mechanical equipment and help build larger power transmission projects, most mines create local machinery and equipment according to local conditions. Last year, the Nanjing Iron Mine had only two winches, forty mine cars, and just over one kilometer of light rail transport. This year, they have made full use of the mine's mechanical repair and assembly capabilities to manufacture winches, local mine cars, local electric locomotives, etc., to equip themselves. Although the number of production workers has been reduced by half this year, as of June 27, the production of iron ore has increased by 38% compared to the same period last year.

　　Hunan
　　(Our Changsha dispatch, July 1st) Iron mines in Hunan Province have mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out mine technical transformation, which has rapidly increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in ore production, and ore production has continued to grow. In May this year, the average daily ore production level increased by 25% compared to April, and in June it increased by more than 15% compared to May.
　　Since April this year, iron mines in various parts of Hunan Province have launched a mass movement for mine technical transformation under the direct leadership of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. At the beginning of the movement, Party committees at all levels mobilized workers to focus on technical reforms of mining, excavation, transportation, and mineral processing tools in response to weak links in production. Since the beginning of this year, twenty-two mines in the province have realized a complete internal transportation system.

　　Jiangxi
　　(Our Nanchang dispatch, July 1st) Iron mines in various parts of Jiangxi Province are closely integrating with production to vigorously carry out technical innovation, which has led to a steady increase in ore production. In early June, the average daily ore production level in the province increased by 43% compared to May, and in mid-June it increased by 37% compared to early June. Now the province's mines have prepared enough "grain" for two months of steel production in the third quarter.
　　In the vigorous technical transformation of mines, mine workers have created dozens of types of indigenous and foreign drilling machines, such as gear drilling machines and foot-operated drilling machines, which have increased work efficiency by one to six times compared to manual drilling.

    大力加强铁矿开采、掘进、运输三个重要环节
    四川山东江苏湖南江西加速矿山技术改造
    四川
    本报重庆1日电　四川省中、小铁矿针对生产关键，发动群众大搞技术革命，使矿石产量、质量获得持续跃进，许多高炉已经做到了吃饱吃好有“余粮”。
    为了保证钢铁持续高产，四川省中、小铁矿从第二季度以来，就把技术革命的矛头指向生产薄弱环节掘进和运输两关。各矿山在掘进方面贯彻了省委要求的以土为主、自力更生的精神，大搞土炸药、土引线、土雷管，使采矿掘进速度大大加快。
    许多中、小铁矿为了解决运输的薄弱环节，井下运输一般都正在实行“三改”：即一改巷（弯改直、小改大），二改道（增加错车道、单道改双道），三改车（小车改大车、一车改列车）。广元县宝轮院铁厂大昌沟矿区由于组成了矿石下山联动线，使担负矿石下山的劳动力减少了90％，矿石下山数量翻了一番，过去要靠外厂购进一部分矿石才能保证高炉需要，现在不仅做到自给自足，而且已有部分余粮。
    山东
    本报济南1日电　山东省矿山系统开展的以提高机械化和半机械化程度为中心的技术改造群众运动，规模逐渐扩大，效果日益显著。目前，全省矿山的械机化和半机械化程度已比今年年初大大提高，矿石日产水平已比2月份提高了33％。由于矿石产量提高，全省钢铁单位已经做到平均有十三天的矿石储量。
    山东省为了大幅度地提高矿石生产水平，中共山东省委在今年3月就号召各矿充分发扬自力更生的精神，坚持土洋并举的方针，加速矿山技术改造。
    由于改造的方向明确，在具体安排上突出重点，兼顾一般，并得到了有关部门的大力支援，因而使改造工作进展很快。
    江苏
    本报南京1日电　江苏各地的小型铁矿通过技术改造、机械化、半机械化程度大大提高，基本上消灭了肩挑人抬和人工打眼的笨重作业。上半年在人员减少近60％的情况下，铁矿石产量比去年同期增长30％以上。小型铁矿的产量已占全省矿石总产量的三分之一。
    江苏省目前共有小型铁矿十八个。今年以来，在省冶金部门统一领导下，制定了技术改造规划，确定以矿内外的运输、采掘设备和输电工程等作为技术改造的重点。
    在矿山技术改造过程中，各矿除依靠省冶金部门调拨一部分主要机械设备和帮助建设较大的输电工程以外，绝大部分是因地制宜地创造土机械、土设备。南京铁矿去年只有两台卷扬机、四十辆矿车，一公里多轻便运输轨道。今年他们充分利用矿内的机械修配力量，制造卷扬机、土矿车、土电机车等，装备自己，今年生产工人虽然减少一半，但到6月27日止，生产铁的矿石比去年同期增长38％。
    湖南
    本报长沙1日电　湖南省各铁矿发动群众大搞矿山技术改造，使矿石生产的机械化和半机械化程度迅速提高，矿石产量不断增长。今年5月份矿石平均日产水平比4月份增长25％，6月份又比5月份提高15％以上。
    湖南省各地的铁矿，从今年4月份起，在中共湖南省委直接领导下，开展了矿山技术改造的群众运动。运动一开始，各级党委就针对生产薄弱环节发动职工狠抓采、掘、运输、选矿工具的技术改革。今年以来，全省有二十二个矿山实现了矿内运输一条龙。
    江西
    本报南昌1日电　江西省各地铁矿紧密结合生产大搞技术革新，使矿石产量日益增长。6月上旬全省矿石产量平均日产水平，比5月份增长43％，6月中旬又比上旬增长37％。现在全省矿山已为第三季度钢铁生产备足了二个月的“粮食”。
    在大搞矿山技术改造中，各矿职工已创制数十种土洋打眼机械；如齿轮打眼机、脚踏打眼机等，比手工打眼提高工效一到六倍。
