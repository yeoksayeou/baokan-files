    Old Worker Passes the Test
    Entering July, Anshan suddenly became sweltering. Standing on the platform of the blast furnace was like being in a large steamer.
    This day, Liu Hongyang, the leader of the furnace front team of the first shift and an old ironmaking worker, took over the shift. He saw that the furnace was spraying coke wildly when the iron was being tapped. This meant that the air volume had to be reduced; reducing the air volume would mean less iron production. Liu Hongyang's heart felt like it was being fried when he thought of this. Without saying a word, he picked up a large iron shovel and led the team in a battle against the fiery slag and coke. The canvas work clothes of many people were scorched by the slag, and they quickly used water hoses to douse them before continuing; beads of sweat flowed down everyone's faces like soybeans... When it was time to tap the iron, Liu Hongyang held a piece of iron rod, his eyes fixed on the taphole, looking for the cause of the coke spraying. He found that the wild spraying of coke was due to too much slag being carried out during the tapping, which eroded the taphole and made it shallow. Because more iron was being produced, more slag was also being produced, and since only one slag outlet was being used, the slag was forced to run out of the taphole. He quickly put down the iron shovel, picked up a crowbar, and went straight to the slag outlet, helping Zhan Baoxian, who was in charge of the slag outlet, and quickly opened another slag outlet with a few strokes. The taphole deepened each time, finally eliminating the phenomenon of slag running during tapping and the need to reduce the air volume, so that the daily pig iron production level in early July increased by 17.87% compared with June.

    老工人闯关
    进入7月，鞍山突然燥热起来。站在高炉平台上，宛如置身于一个大蒸笼里。
    这天，甲班炉前组长、老炼铁工人刘鸿阳接班，他看到炉子出铁时乱喷焦炭。这样，就不得不减少风量；一减少风量，铁就要出得少了。刘鸿阳一想到这里，心像油煎一样。他二话没说，操起大铁锹，就率领全组工人，同火红的渣子和焦炭展开战斗。许多人的帆布工作服，都被渣子烤得直冒烟，赶快用水龙头浇一浇再干；汗珠子像豆粒一样从每个人的脸上流下来……。要出铁了，刘鸿阳手提一段铁棍，眼睛盯住出铁口，寻找喷焦炭的原因。他发现乱喷焦炭是由于出铁时带的渣子太多，把出铁口浸蚀浅了；由于铁产的多，渣子也跟着多起来，而又只用一个渣口放渣，才憋得渣子不得不从出铁口往外跑。他急忙放下铁锹，拣起一根撬棍，直奔放渣口，帮助管出渣口的詹宝贤，一下子两下子就把另一个渣口通开了。出铁口一次比一次加深了，终于消灭了出铁时好跑渣，不得不减风的现象，使7月上旬的生铁日产水平，比6月份增加了17.87％。（华）
