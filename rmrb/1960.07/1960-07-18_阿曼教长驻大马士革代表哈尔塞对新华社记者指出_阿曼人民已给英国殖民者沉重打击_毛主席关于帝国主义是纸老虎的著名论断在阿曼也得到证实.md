　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 16th: On the eve of "Oman Day" on July 18th, Ibrahim Harsah, Director of the Oman Imam's Office in Damascus, gave a speech to Xinhua reporters here, citing Chairman Mao Zedong's famous thesis to summarize the situation of the Omani people's struggle, saying, "Imperialism is a paper tiger. It appears powerful but is actually weak. This has also been confirmed on the battlefield in Oman." He said, "We are confident that we will win the final victory for our just cause throughout Oman."
　　Ibrahim Harsah said when talking about the current situation of armed struggle in Oman, "The current international situation is favorable to the Omani people's struggle. Since the beginning of 1959, the (Omani people's) combat raids against the imperialists have been strengthened and the number of times has doubled."
　　According to a book "The Struggle of Oman" given to reporters earlier by this office director, in the past year alone, Omani commandos killed and wounded about two thousand British troops, including twelve officers; destroyed 214 British vehicles of various types, including fourteen armored vehicles. In the Nizwa-Ibri-Izki area alone, British equipment losses are estimated to be in the millions of pounds. According to figures released by the Oman Imam's Office in Damascus, since the beginning of this year, Omani fighters have killed 542 British soldiers, including 24 officers, wounded 1,120, destroyed 120 vehicles, shot down two aircraft, and destroyed 28 warehouses and oil depots.
　　Ibrahim Harsah pointed to a large map of Oman on the wall of the office and said to the reporter with confidence, "Five years after the British launched the invasion (in 1955), we have not only established a regular Omani army of about 50,000 people, fighting the British aggressors under the leadership of the headquarters in the Green Mountains area of central Oman, but also have a large number of militia, commandos and guerrillas throughout Oman, actively participating in attacks on enemy supply stations and laying mines on all enemy transportation lines." He pointed out that in fact, all the Omani people are participating in various battles against the British occupation. He said that the morale of the Omani people is high. In addition to launching raids and laying mines on British troops, the Omani people also widely distribute pamphlets throughout Oman.
　　Harsah pointed out that because Britain has suffered heavy losses and difficulties on the Omani battlefields, it is trying to strengthen its military reinforcements and plotting new conspiracies to induce Omani patriotic fighters to surrender. He pointed out that British military leaders in the Arabian Gulf region have recently visited Oman to "inspect" the British troops there. At the same time, at the beginning of this month, the British army dispatched its reinforcements to Muscat and the port of Salalah in the southern Omani region of Dhofar. On the other hand, since 1957, Britain has attempted to persuade the Omani people to negotiate with it more than five times, but the Omani people have refused because they know that these so-called negotiations are just conspiracies planned by imperialism against their country, independence and freedom.
　　Harsah reviewed all the British conspiracies and the atrocities of the British imperialist army's frantic killing of peaceful Omani residents and destruction of peaceful Omani towns. He emphasized that the Omani people are vigilant about all these conspiracies. They will never lay down their weapons. The more frantically Britain suppresses and "retaliates" against the Omani people, the more determined the Omani people will be to fight until all of Britain's evil methods fail.
　　Harsah also condemned US imperialism for supporting British imperialism in suppressing the Omani people and plundering Omani resources. As everyone knows, in August 1957, the United States and Britain conducted a dirty deal in London on the Oman issue: it was agreed that the administrative power of Oman would belong to Britain and the oil mining rights would belong to the United States. The United States also provided Britain with weapons and ammunition to support Britain in suppressing the Omani people. Harsah said in an angry tone, "American companies in Oman are plundering the oil in the Dhofar region of southern Oman. The United States can get 200 barrels of crude oil every day. The United States has also begun laying pipelines from Marmul to Mizrak in Dhofar. Therefore, the Omani people know very well that they cannot see any difference between American imperialism and British imperialism. As the head of world imperialism, American imperialism is the most dangerous." He said that although US imperialism hides its face, "it can never deceive us."
　　When talking about the friendly relations between Oman and China, Ibrahim Harsah enthusiastically praised China's noble stance of supporting the just struggle of all Arab peoples and the struggle of all oppressed peoples, including Oman's struggle for independence and freedom. He said that the Deputy Imam of Oman was very moved by China's support for Oman during his visit to China. He also specifically pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong's speeches and articles on military thought have given great encouragement to Omani leaders and soldiers.

　　阿曼教长驻大马士革代表哈尔塞对新华社记者指出
　　阿曼人民已给英国殖民者沉重打击
　　毛主席关于帝国主义是纸老虎的著名论断在阿曼也得到证实
　　阿曼正规军在战斗中壮大力量
　　去年以来已毙伤英军三千多名
    据新华社大马士革16日电　在7月18日“阿曼日”前夕，阿曼教长驻大马士革办事处主任易卜拉欣·哈尔塞在这里向新华社记者发表谈话时，援引毛泽东主席的著名论断，概括阿曼人民斗争的形势说，“帝国主义是纸老虎。它貌似强大，实际虚弱。这一点在阿曼的战场上也得到了证实。”他说，“我们确信，我们将在整个阿曼为我们的正义事业赢得最后胜利。”
    易卜拉欣·哈尔塞在谈到阿曼目前的武装斗争形势时说，“目前的国际形势有利于阿曼人民的斗争。从1959年初以来，（阿曼人民）对帝国主义者的战斗突袭已经加强并且次数增加了一倍。”
    根据这位办事处主任早些时候送给记者的一本书“阿曼的斗争”，仅仅在去年，阿曼突击队就打死打伤约两千名英军，其中包括十二名军官；炸毁各种英国车辆二百一十四辆，其中包括十四辆装甲车。仅仅在尼兹瓦——伊布里——伊兹基地区，据估计英国装备的损失即达数百万英镑。另据阿曼教长驻大马士革办事处发表的数字，今年初以来，阿曼战士共打死英军五百四十二人，其中包括二十四名军官，打伤一千一百二十人，击毁一百二十辆车辆，打落两架飞机，炸毁二十八个仓库和油库。
    易卜拉欣·哈尔塞指着办事处墙上的大幅阿曼地图满怀信心地对记者说，“在英国（1955年）发动侵略五年后的今天，我们不但建立了有五万人左右的阿曼正规军，在设在阿曼中部绿山地区的总部领导下同英国侵略军进行战斗，而且在整个阿曼，还有人数众多的民兵、突击队和游击队，积极参加对敌军供应站发动的袭击，在敌人所有的交通线上埋设地雷。”他指出，实际上，全体阿曼人民都参加了各种反对英国占领的战斗。他说，阿曼人民的士气高昂。阿曼人民除了对英军发动突袭和埋地雷之外，还在阿曼各地广泛散发小册子。
    哈尔塞指出，由于英国在阿曼各战场上遭到重大损失和困难，它正在设法加强它的军事增援部队和策划新阴谋，来劝诱阿曼爱国战士投降。他指出，英国驻阿拉伯湾地区的军事首脑最近纷纷到阿曼“视察”那里的英国军队。同时，英国军队在本月初又把它的增援部队派遣到马斯喀特和阿曼南部佐法尔地区的苏丹港。另一方面，自从1957年到现在，英国曾经有五次以上企图劝诱阿曼人民同它谈判，但是，阿曼人民拒绝了，因为他们知道，这些所谓谈判只不过是帝国主义对他们的国家、独立和自由所策划的阴谋。
    哈尔塞回顾了所有英国的阴谋和英帝国主义军队疯狂残杀和平的阿曼居民，破坏和平的阿曼城镇的暴行。他强调说，阿曼人民警惕到所有这些阴谋。他们决不会放下他们的武器。英国对阿曼人民的镇压和“报复行为”越疯狂，阿曼人民也将越坚决地斗争，直到使英国的所有罪恶手段都失败为止。
    哈尔塞还谴责美帝国主义支持英帝国主义镇压阿曼人民和它对阿曼资源的掠夺。大家知道，1957年8月，美国同英国就阿曼问题在伦敦进行了一笔肮脏交易：商定阿曼的管理权归英国，石油开采权归美国。美国还向英国提供武器弹药，支持英国镇压阿曼人民。哈尔塞用愤怒的语气说，“在阿曼的美国公司正在掠夺阿曼南部的佐法尔地区的石油。美国每天可以得到两百桶原油。美国还开始铺设从佐法尔的马尔穆勒到米兹拉克的油管。因此阿曼人民知道得很清楚，他们看不出美帝国主义和英帝国主义有什么区别。作为世界帝国主义的头子的美帝国主义是最危险的。”他说，尽管美帝国主义把它的面目掩盖起来，但是“它决骗不了我们”。
    易卜拉欣·哈尔塞在谈到阿曼同中国的友好关系时，热情赞扬中国支持所有阿拉伯人民的正义斗争和所有被压迫人民的斗争，包括阿曼争取独立和自由的斗争的崇高立场。他说，阿曼副教长在访问中国时对于中国对阿曼的支持非常感动。他还特别指出，毛泽东主席的关于军事思想的讲话和文章给予阿曼的领导人和战士们很大的鼓舞。
