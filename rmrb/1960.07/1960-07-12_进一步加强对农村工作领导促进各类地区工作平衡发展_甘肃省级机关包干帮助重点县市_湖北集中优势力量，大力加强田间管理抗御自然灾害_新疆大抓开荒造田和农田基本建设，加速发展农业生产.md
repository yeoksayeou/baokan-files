Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th July: The CCP Gansu Provincial Committee, after mobilizing 100,000 cadres to go deep into the front line of agricultural production, recently decided that each provincial system would undertake to help one or two key counties and cities, to further strengthen leadership in rural work.

The Provincial Committee decided that the provincial party and mass organizations, political and legal affairs, industry and transportation, agriculture and forestry, finance and trade, culture and education, united front, military, science and technology, and planning systems would respectively undertake to help the work in 11 counties and cities, including Jingning, Qingshui, Minxian, Tongwei, Longxi, Minqin, Dewulu, Hezheng, Yuzhong, Wushan, and Wuwei. The tasks are: to be stationed there long-term, to comprehensively promote progress, not only to achieve an all-round and high-speed leap forward in the work of these counties and cities, but also to gain experience to promote the work of other counties; and it is stipulated that each county and commune must be assigned a responsible cadre; those who go down should be led by leading comrades from their own system and department, just like during the land reform and agricultural cooperation period, to go deep into the countryside, down to the grassroots, to eat, live, work, and consult with the masses. At the same time, each unit can also cultivate its own "experimental fields" related to its business, and guide the work of its department through the experimental fields. At present, the central task of the cadres who have gone down is to grasp the current production, make achievements in all aspects of the summer harvest, autumn field management, distribution, commune members' lives, and animal husbandry, promote the balanced development of various regions, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, various departments held meetings overnight to organize forces and study working methods. By July 4th, more than 330 people had arrived at their posts. Twenty cadres from the Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, led by the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, went to Wushan County on July 2nd to carry out their work. Fifty-seven cadres from the industrial and transportation system, led by the Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Transportation and the Deputy Director of the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, arrived in Tongwei County on July 4th.

In order to strengthen rural work more comprehensively, the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee has also decided that county-level leading cadres must spend seven months of the year in the countryside, prefectural committee-level leading cadres must spend six months of the year in the countryside, provincial-level leading cadres must spend four months of the year in the countryside, and the first secretary of the municipal party committee must spend two months of the year deep in the suburbs, to strengthen the leadership of the front line of agricultural production and promote the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11th: Hubei Province is concentrating leadership forces and cadres and labor, strengthening the front line of agriculture, actively carrying out activities to prevent drought and flood, weeding and topdressing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, to strive for an all-round bumper harvest in the autumn.

Under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, Hubei Province's summer planting work this year has been done well, quickly, and comprehensively. The mid-season rice, which has always occupied an important position in the province's rice production, has increased its planting area by about 20% this year compared with last year. The area of miscellaneous grains such as corn, sweet potatoes, sorghum, and millet sown in various places has also been expanded compared with last year. Various localities have also tried every means to increase the planting of a large number of minor economic crops and melons, beans, and vegetables around the fields and in front of and behind houses. At present, these crops are growing well. Half of the mid-season rice has been weeded, 30% has been topdressed, and various miscellaneous grain crops are also being weeded and topdressed.

Recently, the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee held an enlarged meeting to analyze the situation of autumn field management, and required leaders at all levels to go deep into the front line of production, concentrate superior forces to strengthen agricultural production, and vigorously carry out activities to prevent drought and flood, weed and topdress, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, all localities, adhering to the principle of "focusing on key points and making comprehensive arrangements," have distinguished between primary and secondary, urgent and non-urgent tasks, rationally arranged work, and concentrated more labor to participate in agricultural production. At present, more than 6 million laborers have been concentrated on the front line of agriculture in the province. At the same time, more than 100,000 cadres in the province have left their offices to settle down in production teams, eating, living, working, and consulting with the vast number of commune members.

According to Hubei's experience over the years, various natural disasters occur frequently in July, August, and September, which is also a critical time for the growth of crops such as rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. Therefore, preventing and resisting various natural disasters plays a significant role in striving for a bumper harvest for the whole year. Various localities have made preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and materials as early as possible, striving for the initiative. Counties along the Yangtze and Han Rivers established flood control headquarters as early as May, with leading cadres from the Party and government personally directing them. The Jingzhou Prefecture, which straddles the Yangtze and Han Rivers, has organized a flood control team of tens of thousands of people to ensure the agricultural harvest in the Jianghan Plain. In order to give full play to the irrigation benefits of the newly built reservoir projects, many counties in mountainous and hilly areas are actively strengthening leadership, conducting in-depth inspections, and actively repairing substandard projects. At the same time, according to past drought resistance experience, great efforts are being made to store and conserve water. Huanggang Prefecture alone has increased its water storage capacity by 700 million cubic meters compared with the same period last year. In order to prevent and eliminate plant diseases and insect pests, Jingzhou, Huanggang, Wuhan and other regions, adhering to the spirit of prevention being more important than treatment and treating early, well, and thoroughly, are preventing insects when there are no insects and treating insects when there are insects, with secretaries at all levels taking the lead in attacking insect pests.

Sufficient fertilizer is the central link in doing a good job in autumn field management. Various localities are seizing the current good opportunity of rampant weeds and vigorous aquatic plants to accumulate green manure on a large scale, accumulating and applying it at the same time. Huanggang Prefecture has invested more than 200,000 people in accumulating fertilizer, and has already accumulated 1.4 billion catties of green fertilizer. Many communes have not only prepared enough topdressing fertilizer for autumn crops, but have also begun to prepare base fertilizer for autumn planting crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 10th: The CCP committees at all levels in Xinjiang have resolutely implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the center and accelerating the development of agricultural production, and, according to local favorable conditions, have prominently seized the work of large-scale land reclamation and farmland capital construction. As of now, more than 7.7 million mu of wasteland with water conservancy facilities have been reclaimed throughout the autonomous region, and most of it has been planted, overfulfilling the annual sowing plan.

Xinjiang's water and soil resources are extremely rich. After exploration, there are more than 100 million mu of reclaimable land in the autonomous region. At the beginning of this year, the CCP Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee, based on the new situation that the autonomous region's industrial construction will have greater development, under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, decided to further accelerate the speed of land reclamation. It was determined that in addition to carrying out water conservancy and large-scale land reclamation projects every winter, it was also decided to adopt a combination of large-scale mass movements and the organization of specialized teams within one year according to the agricultural season, engaging in large-scale work during slack seasons and small-scale work during busy seasons, reclaiming land and repairing water conservancy facilities all year round, and combining land reclamation with land leveling and sowing to enable agricultural production to develop faster.

The CCP committees at all levels in Xinjiang have resolutely implemented the above-mentioned policy. The 45 people's communes in Hotan Prefecture at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains have generally organized land reclamation expedition teams, led by the commune in a unified manner and with the brigade as the unit, to reclaim large areas of wasteland in barren areas 100 to 200 li away. In more than half a year, they have reclaimed 1 million mu of paddy fields, increasing the average paddy field area per person in the prefecture by 1.3 mu. Hami Prefecture, which has a small population and the most severe water shortage, has reclaimed a total of 400,000 mu of wasteland from last winter to the present, exceeding the total land reclamation in the ten years since liberation by one and a half times, and overfulfilling the prefecture's sowing plan by 13%. The vast number of military reclamation farms and local state-owned farms distributed throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have also given full play to the potential of various machines since last winter, continuously reclaiming land and expanding the sown area. Among them, the military reclamation farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have reclaimed 2.24 million mu of farmland with water conservancy facilities in half a year, increasing the grain sown area by more than 70% compared with last year.

Because the CCP committees at all levels in Xinjiang deeply realize that expanding the cultivated area through land reclamation is a key measure for developing agriculture at a high speed, they have attached special importance to the quality of land reclamation and farmland construction from the very beginning. Most of the newly reclaimed wasteland this year has been uniformly planned according to regular farms, with canal systems, roads, forest belts, residential areas, orchards, and nurseries built.

    进一步加强对农村工作领导促进各类地区工作平衡发展
　　甘肃省级机关包干帮助重点县市
　　湖北集中优势力量，大力加强田间管理抗御自然灾害
　　新疆大抓开荒造田和农田基本建设，加速发展农业生产
    新华社兰州11日电　中共甘肃省委继动员十万干部深入农业生产第一线之后，最近又决定由省级各系统分口包干一两个重点县市，进一步加强对农村工作的领导。
    省委决定省级的党群、政法、工交、农林、财贸、文教、统战、部队、科技、计划等系统，分别包干帮助静宁、清水、岷县、通渭、陇西、民勤、德乌鲁、和政、榆中、武山、武威等十一个县市的工作。包干的任务是：常期驻扎，全面促进，不但使这些县市的工作全面地高速度跃进，而且要取得经验推动其他县的工作；并且规定，每个县和公社必须配有一个负责干部；下去的人由本系统、本部门的领导同志带队，像土地改革和农业合作化时期一样，深入农村，下到基层，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。同时，各单位还可以种自己业务方面的“试验田”，通过试验田指导本部门工作。目前下去的干部中心任务是抓好当前生产，从夏收、秋田管理、分配、社员生活、畜牧业等各个环节上做出成绩，促使各类地区工作平衡发展，争取今年农业大丰收。
    各部门根据省委指示，连夜分别召开会议，组织力量，研究工作方法。到7月4日，已有三百三十多人到达工作岗位。省科委和中国科学院兰州分院的二十名干部由中国科学院兰州分院党委副书记领队，已在7月2日到武山县开展工作。工交系统五十七名干部，由省交通厅副厅长、省邮电局副局长领队，7月4日到达通渭县。
    中共甘肃省委为了更全面地加强农村工作，又决定县级领导干部一年必须下乡七个月，地委一级领导干部一年必须下乡六个月，省级领导干部一年必须下乡四个月，市委第一书记一年必须有两个月时间深入郊区，以加强农业生产第一线的领导力量，促进农业生产持续跃进。
    据新华社武汉11日电　湖北省各地正集中领导力量和干部、劳力，加强农业第一线，积极开展防旱防涝、除草追肥、防治病虫害的活动，力夺秋季全面丰收。
    在以农业为基础的思想指导下，今年湖北省的夏种工作抓得好、抓得快、抓得全面。历来在全省水稻生产中占重要地位的中稻，今年的插秧面积比去年扩大了20％左右。各地播种的苞谷、红苕、高粱、粟谷等杂粮也都比去年有所扩大。各地还千方百计地利用田边地角、房前屋后增种了大量的小宗经济作物和瓜、豆、菜等。目前，这些作物都生长良好，中稻已有一半除了草，30％追了肥，各种杂粮作物也都正在除草追肥。
    最近，中共湖北省委召开了扩大会议，对秋田管理的情况进行了分析，要求各级领导深入生产第一线，集中优势力量加强农业生产，大力开展防旱防涝，除草追肥和防治病虫害活动。按照省委的指示，各地都以“突击中心，全面安排”的原则，分清主次、缓急，合理安排活路，集中更多的劳动力参加农业生产。目前，全省集中到农业第一线的劳动力已达六百多万人。同时，全省还有十多万干部走出办公室，到生产小队安家落户，与广大社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。
    根据湖北历年经验，7、8、9三个月各种自然灾害频繁，而这个时期，又是水稻、棉花、杂粮等作物生长的关键时刻。因此，防止和抗御各种自然灾害，对争取全年丰收起着重大作用。各地都及早从思想上、组织上和物质上作好准备，力争主动。长江、汉水沿岸各县早在5月间就建立了防汛指挥部，由党政负责干部亲自指挥。横跨长江、汉江两岸的荆州专区，为保证江汉平原的农业丰收，已经组织一支有数万人参加的防汛队伍。为了充分地发挥新修水库工程的灌溉效益，山区、丘陵地区许多县都积极加强领导，深入检查，积极整修不够标准的工程。同时，根据往年抗旱经验，大抓蓄水保水。仅黄冈专区就比去年同期增加蓄水量七亿立方米。为了防止和消灭病虫害，荆州、黄冈、武汉等地区都本着防重于治和治早、治好、治了的精神，无虫防虫，有虫治虫，层层由书记挂帅，向虫害进攻。
    肥料充足是搞好秋田管理的中心环节，各地都抓住当前野草丛生、水草旺盛的大好时机，大积青肥，边积边施。黄冈专区投入积肥的人数达二十多万，已经打青积肥十四亿斤。许多公社不仅为大秋作物备足了追肥，还开始为秋种作物准备了底肥。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　中共新疆各级党委坚决贯彻了以农业为中心，加速发展农业生产的方针，根据当地有利条件，突出地大抓开荒造田和农田基本建设工作。截至目前，全自治区已开垦出有水利设施的荒地七百七十多万亩，大部分已经种上，超额完成了全年播种计划。
    新疆水土资源极其丰富，经过勘察，全自治区可垦荒地有亿亩以上。今年年初，中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委，根据自治区的工业建设将有更大发展的新形势，在以农业为基础的思想指导下，又决定进一步加快垦荒速度。确定除每年冬季大兴水利、大规模开荒造田外，还决定在一年之内按照农时季节，采取大搞群众运动和组织专业队相结合的形式，农闲大干、农忙小干，常年开荒、常年修水利，结合开荒造田，一边平整土地，一边播种，使农业生产得到更快的发展。
    新疆各级党委坚决贯彻执行了上述方针。昆仑山下和田专区四十五个人民公社，从去冬以来就普遍由公社统一领导，以大队为单位组织了开荒远征队，到一、二百里以外的荒原上开垦大片荒地，半年多来开出水田一百万亩，使全专区每人平均增加了一点三亩水田。人口少、水源最缺的哈密专区，从去冬到目前，共开荒四十万亩，超过解放十年来开荒总和的一倍半，超额13％完成了全专区播种计划。分布在天山南北的广大军垦农场和地方国营农场，从去冬以来也充分发挥各种机具的潜力，不断开荒扩大播种面积。其中新疆生产建设兵团各军垦农场，半年内就开垦出有水利设施的农田二百二十四万亩，使粮食播种面积比去年扩大了70％以上。
    新疆各级党委由于深切地体会到开荒扩大耕地面积是高速度发展农业的关键性措施，一开始就特别重视开荒造田的质量。今年大部分新开的荒地都按正规农场作了统一规划，修建了渠系，规划了道路林带、居住区、果园和苗圃等。
