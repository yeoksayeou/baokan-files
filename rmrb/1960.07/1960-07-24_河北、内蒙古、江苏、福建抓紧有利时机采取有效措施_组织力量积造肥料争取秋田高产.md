Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 23rd: Party organizations and the broad masses of commune members in Hebei Province have taken summer fertilizer accumulation and production, and topdressing as important measures to ensure a bumper autumn harvest.
In the fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, all localities are vigorously promoting pig raising for fertilizer accumulation. At present, many areas are carrying out a "no idle pen" campaign, assigning specific fertilizer accumulation tasks to pig raising units according to the size of the pigs. The fertilizer target was proposed by each pig farm circle in Fangtian Pig Farm, Qingfengdian Commune, Ding County. Now, each circle in the entire farm accumulates 20 carts of fertilizer per month, an increase of 25% compared to the past. The twenty-nine high-yield Fangtian pig farms in Wangjing Commune, Tang County, have universally implemented the "three unifieds" (unified bedding, unified pig movement, and unified manure transportation) and "three layers" (layer of grass, layer of soil, layer of water) methods of fertilizer accumulation, greatly improving the efficiency and quality of fertilizer accumulation.
All localities are also seizing the current favorable opportunity of abundant weeds to cut large amounts of grass for green manure. Many communes and teams in the plains area are establishing fertilizer heating plants, fermentation ponds, and insulation kilns in high-yield Fangtian, combining weed removal and thinning to vigorously press and compost green manure; mountainous areas are vigorously cutting green branches and accumulating miscellaneous fertilizer. Nandong Commune in Gaocheng County implements a one-hour daily fertilizer accumulation system, putting forward the slogan "two baskets of soil at noon, two buckets of water in the evening, one basket of manure to the field, one basket of grass back to the village," and the entire commune has already cut 120,000 catties of grass and transported 600,000 catties of coarse fertilizer.
While vigorously promoting farm manure, Party committees at all levels are also vigorously promoting the production of local chemical fertilizers. The province has successfully produced or trial-produced a total of ten types and thirty-two kinds of local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers, including nitrogen extraction from flue dust, ammonia water recovery, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and rhizobia, which have simple equipment, low cost, and good quality. Quzhou County has established 654 local chemical fertilizer plants, producing nine kinds of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate.

Hohhot, July 23rd: People's communes in rural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are seizing the opportunity in autumn field management, organizing forces, and launching a mass campaign of large-scale fertilizer accumulation, production, and topdressing. The output of farm manure and local chemical fertilizers throughout the region is increasing daily, and the current topdressing area has reached more than 6 million mu, an increase of 70% compared to the same period last year. The seedlings that have been topdressed are growing vigorously and lushly, creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest of various crops.
The Party committees at all levels in Aohan Banner, Zhaowuda League, have paid special attention to summer fertilizer work. The entire banner has successively drawn more than 10,000 laborers to work day and night, and in a short period of time accumulated 400 million catties of various coarse and fine fertilizers, applying 500 to 2,500 catties of topdressing fertilizer to each mu of autumn field. Communes of this banner universally adopted the method of "not going to the mountains empty-handed, bringing fertilizer to the fields for production," and implemented "large vats to the fields, earthenware vats to the ground, building toilets with the army (summer hoeing teams)," to achieve on-site fertilizer accumulation and on-site topdressing, saving a lot of labor and accelerating the progress of fertilizer accumulation and topdressing. Many communes also organized professional teams to run refined fertilizer plants, turning coarse fertilizer into finer fertilizer with higher fertilizer efficiency. Tumote Banner communes, while strengthening weeding, watering, and pest control, widely mobilized commune members to accumulate and produce fertilizer, and carried out large-scale fertilization, raising more than 30% of the third-class seedlings to first-class seedlings within ten days.
During the accumulation, production, and transportation of fertilizer, many communes also launched tool reform activities. Wuchuan County, Alukeerqin Banner and other places, in addition to dispatching thousands of topdressing vehicles, also reformed a batch of high-efficiency fertilizer crushing, soil digging, and topdressing tools. The 25 newly self-made seven-row topdressing vehicles in the Wuxing Management Area of the Genghis Khan Commune, Buteha Banner, topdressed an average of more than 50 mu per vehicle per day, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. The topdressing plan that this management area originally needed thirteen days to complete was completed in only five days.
In order to help rural communes increase fertilizer application, industrial and mining areas in various cities of Inner Mongolia have sent the accumulated manure fertilizer to the communes.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 23rd: The local chemical fertilizer and pesticide plants run by people's communes in various parts of Jiangsu Province have launched a heat wave of manufacturing local chemical fertilizers and pesticides to ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops. At present, the province has produced 200,000 tons of local chemical fertilizers and 332,000 tons of local pesticides for autumn crops.
Inspired by the action slogan of "Su North catching up with Su South, Su South reaching a new level," the vast rural areas of Jiangsu Province established local chemical fertilizer and pesticide plants in every commune and team in February this year. The output of local chemical fertilizers produced from January to April alone increased more than two times compared to the same period last year, and the output of local pesticides increased more than four times, which strongly supported the needs of topdressing and pest control for summer crops. After the busy summer harvest and planting, the enthusiasm for producing local chemical fertilizers and pesticides in various places has become greater and greater. The commercial departments of Taicang County organized more than 270 commercial personnel to go to the production teams to help the production teams overcome the five barriers of ideology, labor force, raw materials, fuel, and technology. In the past month, the output of local chemical fertilizers has increased more than seven times compared to the same period last year.
The Party committees of many district communes personally took charge, and each brigade had a special person in charge. Commercial departments regarded the organization of local chemical fertilizer and pesticide production as an important task to be completed. In production, various places implemented the policy of "taking materials locally, producing locally, and using locally." Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing areas have no phosphate mines, so they focused on the production of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer; Suzhou, Yangzhou, and other areas have abundant peat, so they focused on the production of peat dry distillation ammonia water and humic acid fertilizer; coastal cities and counties such as Xin Hailian, Binhai, and Qidong used the bitter brine of salt fields to produce potassium-magnesium fertilizer; Lishui, Donghai, and other counties have barite, and local communes organized special forces to carry out mining. In the first half of the year, more than 13 million catties of barium polysulfide were used for production in the province.
In order to improve the quality of local chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the provincial commercial, agricultural, science association, and institutions of higher learning organized investigation groups to go deep into the communes to investigate resource conditions and summarize experiences. This year, through various training courses, more than 500,000 local chemical fertilizer and pesticide technicians were trained for communes and production teams.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 23rd: Small local chemical fertilizer plants run by counties, communes, and teams in Fujian Province are rushing to produce fertilizer for a bumper late rice harvest.
These local chemical fertilizer plants are all built by making use of simple and crude facilities, taking materials locally, and using local equipment and old tools. Chong'an County used broken temples, lime kilns, stone mills, water mills, old factory buildings, etc., to build more than 500 local chemical fertilizer plants in a few days, producing a total of 1.07 million dan of various local chemical fertilizers and other high-quality fertilizers using local fertilizer sources. Pengkou and other six communes in Liancheng County used abundant peat and other resources in the mountainous areas to produce fertilizer, and the county's daily output of local chemical fertilizer increased from nearly 1,000 dan to more than 2,000 dan. After Shouning County promoted the experience of nitrogen extraction from flue dust in Nanyang Brigade of Nanyang Commune, the stoves of all public canteens and livestock farms in the county were equipped with nitrogen extraction equipment, and 6,500 dan of nitrogen fertilizer have now been produced.
In the large-scale production of local chemical fertilizers, the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels in charge of industry took the lead, and technical talents were also vigorously trained.

    河北、内蒙古、江苏、福建抓紧有利时机采取有效措施
    组织力量积造肥料争取秋田高产
    河北
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省各级党组织和广大社员已把夏季积肥、造肥、追肥作为保证秋季丰收的一项重要措施。
    在积肥造肥运动中，各地都大搞养猪积肥。目前，不少地区正开展“无闲圈”运动，对养猪单位按猪只大小分配了一定积肥任务。定县清风店公社方田养猪场圈圈提出了积肥指标。现在全场每圈每月积肥已达二十车，较过去增长25％。唐县王京公社二十九个丰产方田猪场，普遍推行了“三统”（统一垫圈、统一起圈、统一运粪）、“三层”（层草、层土、层水）的积肥方法，积肥效率和积肥质量都大大提高。
    各地还抓住当前杂草丛生的有利时机，大量割草绿肥。平原地区的许多社、队都在丰产方田内建立肥料加温厂、发酵池、保温窑等，结合清除杂草和间苗中耕，大力压沤绿肥；山区大搞割青棵、积杂肥。藁城县南董公社实行每日一小时的积肥制度，提出“中午两筐土，晚上两担水，到田一筐粪，回村一筐草”的口号，全社已打草十二万斤，运出粗肥六十万斤。
    各级党委在大抓农家肥料的同时，还大抓土化肥生产。全省已进行生产或试制成功的土化肥和细菌肥共有十类三十二种，其中设备简易，成本较低，质量较好的有烟中取氮、回收氨水、固氮菌、根瘤菌等。曲周县已建立土化肥厂六百五十四座，共生产出硫酸铵、过磷酸钙等化肥九种。
    内蒙古
    本报呼和浩特23日电　内蒙古自治区各地农村人民公社，在秋田管理工作中抓紧时机，组织力量，展开大积肥、大造肥和大追肥的群众运动。全区农家肥、土化肥产量逐日上升，目前追肥面积已达六百多万亩，比去年同期增加了70％。经过追肥的禾苗生长得油亮茁壮。给各种作物丰收创造了有利条件。
    昭乌达盟敖汉旗各级党委对夏季肥料工作抓得特别好。全旗先后抽出一万多名劳动力，日夜突击，短期内便积造各种粗细肥料四亿斤，已给每亩秋田施上追肥五百斤到二千五百斤。这个旗各公社普遍采取“上山不空手，下地生产带肥料”的办法，并实行“大缸到田，瓦缸下地，随军（夏锄队伍）建厕所，作到就地积肥，就地追肥，既节省大量劳动力，又加快了积肥追肥进度。许多公社还组织专业队，举办精制肥料厂，把粗肥制成肥效更高的细肥。土默特旗各公社在加强锄草、浇水、除虫工作的同时，广泛发动社员积肥造肥，大搞大面积施肥，十天之内就使30％以上的三类苗上升为一类苗。
    在积造和运送肥料时，不少公社还展开了工具改革活动。武川县、阿鲁科尔沁旗等地除出动成千辆追肥车外，还改制出一批高工效的碎肥、挖土、追肥工具。布特哈旗成吉思汗公社五星管理区新近自制的二十五台七行追肥车，平均每台每天追肥五十亩以上，提高工效两倍多。这个管理区原来要十三天才能完成的追肥计划，只用五天就完成了。
    为帮助农村公社增施肥料，内蒙古各城市工矿区纷纷把积攒的粪肥送往公社。
    江苏
    据新华社南京23日电　江苏省各地人民公社办的土化肥、土农药厂掀起了制造土化肥、土农药的热潮，确保秋收作物丰收。目前全省已为秋收作物生产土化肥二十万吨，土农药三十三万二千吨。
    江苏省广大农村在“苏北赶江南，江南更上一层楼”的行动口号鼓舞下，今年2月间社社队队都办起了土化肥、土农药厂。仅1到4月份生产的土化肥比去年同期增加二倍以上，土农药增加四倍以上，有力地支持了夏收作物追肥、治虫的需要。夏收夏种大忙结束后，各地生产土化肥、土农药的劲头越来越大。太仓县商业部门组织了二百七十多名商业人员到生产队，帮助生产队猛攻思想、劳动力、原料、燃料、技术等五关，近一个月来，土化肥产量比去年同期增长七倍多。
    许多地区公社党委都亲自挂帅，各个大队都有专人负责。商业部门把组织土化肥、土农药的生产作为一件重要任务来完成。在生产中，各地贯彻了“就地取材、就地生产、就地使用”的方针。徐州、镇江和南京地区没有磷矿，就重点生产钙镁磷肥；苏州、扬州等地区有丰富的泥炭，就重点生产泥炭干馏氨水、胡敏酸肥料；沿海的新海连、滨海、启东等市、县，利用盐场的苦卤生产钾镁肥；溧水、东海等县有重晶石，当地公社都组织了专门力量进行开采，上半年全省用以生产的多硫化钡达一千三百多万斤。
    为了提高土化肥、土农药的质量，省商业、农业、科协和高等院校等组织了考察团，深入公社调查资源情况和总结经验，今年还通过各种训练班，为公社、生产队培训了五十多万名土化肥、土农药技术人员。
    福建
    据新华社福州23日电　福建省各县、社、队办的小土化肥厂正为晚稻丰收赶造肥料。
    这些土化肥厂都是因陋就简、就地取材和利用土设备、旧工具办起来的。崇安县利用破庙、灰窑、石磨、水碓、旧厂房等，几天内就办起五百多个土化肥厂，利用当地肥源生产出各种土化肥和其他优质肥料共一百零七万担。连城县的朋口等六个公社利用山区丰富的泥炭等资源造肥，全县土化肥日产量由原来的近千担增加到二千多担。寿宁县推广南阳公社南阳大队烟中取氮的经验后，全县各公共食堂和畜牧场的炉灶都安装上取氮设备，现已生产氮肥六千五百担。
    在大造土化肥中，各地都由各级党委分管工业的书记挂帅，还大力培训技术人材。
