Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th. Pyongyang's "Labor News" today published an editorial to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Korean Armistice, stating that the Korean people will fight more bravely to force the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland at an early date.

The editorial, entitled "The Day of Historical Victory over the American Imperialist Aggressors," pointed out that the victory achieved in the Korean War was a victory for the forces of world peace and socialism, and a heavy blow to the "position of strength" policy pursued by American imperialism after World War II.

The editorial said that this victory first and foremost signifies the glorious victory of Marxism-Leninism, the victory of the people's democratic system in Korea, and proves the correctness of the Korean Workers' Party's line on establishing and strengthening revolutionary democratic bases. It also demonstrates that the people who stand up against colonialism and fight for the freedom and independence of their fatherland cannot be conquered by any force.

The editorial emphasized that the entire course of the Korean War demonstrated the great vitality of the proletarian internationalist friendship and solidarity between the countries of the socialist camp. It said that the generous material and spiritual assistance given by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp to the heroic resistance of the Korean people was one of the important factors guaranteeing the victory of the Korean people. In particular, during the period when the Korean people faced severe tests, the Chinese people held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sent volunteers, and aided the Korean people with blood, making immortal contributions to defeating the aggressors.

The editorial said that since the armistice, the main force of the Korean people striving for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland has been strengthened and developed immeasurably. Today, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been built into a socialist industrial-agricultural country, possessing a solid foundation for a self-sufficient national economy, and the entire people are united as one around the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung.

The editorial said that, on the contrary, the American imperialist policy of aggression is facing an increasingly serious crisis. "The people of South Korea, unable to endure their suffering living conditions, finally rose up to fight and overthrow the running dog of American imperialism – the traitor Syngman Rhee."

The editorial emphasized that, in order to salvage its increasingly shaky position of aggression, the American imperialist aggressors have taken a series of actions in violation of the armistice agreement, frantically increased their military strength, and carried out various provocative activities. American imperialism has expanded the South Korean puppet army from sixteen divisions to thirty-one divisions, expelled the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea, unilaterally abolished the clauses in the armistice agreement prohibiting the introduction of reinforcing combat materials from outside Korea, and in recent years has even brought atomic weapons into South Korea. The editorial said, "The policy pursued by American imperialism in South Korea is not to fulfill the obligations imposed on it by the armistice agreement, but to undermine the armistice agreement."

The editorial said that American imperialism and its running dogs are playing tricks to deceive the people in order to maintain the foundation of their colonial rule. They intend to use the "National Assembly election" farce to be staged in South Korea on July 29 to maintain the puppet rule of the "Democratic Party" upper echelon group that succeeded Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party." The editorial pointed out, "However, today, no matter who acts as a running dog for American imperialism in South Korea to continue implementing Syngman Rhee's fascist rule, they will not be able to clean up the mess in South Korea today. After this 'election,' when the people realize that the blood shed in April has not been repaid, a second and third angry uprising of the people will inevitably break out."

The editorial said, "Only the withdrawal of American imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea and the resolution of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves through North-South consultation and North-South general elections is the road to consolidating peace in Korea, cleaning up the current situation in South Korea, and peacefully resolving the Korean issue."

The editorial emphasized that the American imperialist aggressor troops no longer have any reason to continue to remain in South Korea and must immediately withdraw from South Korea. Today, the united momentum of the thirty million Korean people under the banner of anti-American national salvation struggle is greater than ever. The Korean people will never allow the American imperialist aggressors to continue their war schemes of aggression in South Korea.

### 平壤“劳动新闻”就朝鲜停战七周年发表社论  朝鲜人民决不许美国侵略者赖在南朝鲜

    平壤“劳动新闻”就朝鲜停战七周年发表社论
    朝鲜人民决不许美国侵略者赖在南朝鲜
    新华社平壤27日电　平壤“劳动新闻”今天为纪念朝鲜停战七周年发表社论说，朝鲜人民将更加勇敢地进行斗争，以迫使美军从南朝鲜撤走，早日实现祖国的和平统一。
    这篇题为“对美帝国主义侵略者的历史性胜利的日子”的社论指出，朝鲜战争所取得的胜利，是世界和平和社会主义力量的胜利，也是对美帝国主义在第二次世界大战后所奉行的“实力地位”政策的沉重打击。
    社论说，这个胜利首先意味着马克思列宁主义的光辉胜利，意味着朝鲜的人民民主制度的胜利，并证明了朝鲜劳动党关于建立和加强革命的民主基地的路线的正确性。这还表明，为反对殖民主义、争取祖国的自由和独立而站起来的人民是任何力量都不能征服的。
    社论强调说，朝鲜战争的整个过程表明了社会主义阵营各国之间的无产阶级国际主义的友谊和团结的伟大生命力。它说，社会主义阵营中的苏联、中国和其他国家的人民对朝鲜人民的英勇抗战给予的物质上和精神上的慷慨援助，是保障朝鲜人民的胜利的重要因素之一。特别是，在朝鲜人民面临着严重考验的时期，中国人民高举起抗美援朝的旗帜，派来了志愿军，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民，为打败侵略者立下了不朽的功勋。
    社论说，停战以来直到现在，朝鲜人民争取祖国的和平统一的主体力量无比地加强和发展了。今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经建设成为一个社会主义工业—农业国家，拥有能够自给的国民经济的巩固基础，全国人民钢铁一般团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的周围。
    社论说，与此相反，美帝国主义的侵略政策面临着日益严重的危机，“南朝鲜人民在苦难的生活处境中忍无可忍，终于起来斗争，打倒了美帝国主义的走狗——卖国贼李承晚”。
    社论强调指出，美帝国主义侵略者为了挽救其日益动摇的侵略地位，采取了一系列违反停战协定的行为，疯狂地增强军事力量，并进行各种挑衅活动。美帝国主义把南朝鲜伪军由十六个师扩大到三十一个师，从南朝鲜逐出了中立国监察小组，单方面地废除了停战协定中关于禁止从朝鲜境外运入增援性作战物资的条款，最近几年来甚至将原子武器运进了南朝鲜。社论说，“美帝国主义在南朝鲜推行的政策，不是履行停战协定赋于它的义务，而是破坏停战协定。”
    社论说，美帝国主义及其走狗为了维持其殖民统治基础，正在玩弄欺骗人民的把戏。他们打算通过7月29日将在南朝鲜上演的“国会选举”丑剧，使接替李承晚“自由党”的“民主党”上层集团维持傀儡统治。社论指出，“但是，今天不管是谁在南朝鲜作美帝国主义的走狗来继续推行李承晚的法西斯统治，也无法收拾今天南朝鲜的残局。在这次‘选举’之后，当人民知道4月间流的血并没有得到代价时，就将不可避免地爆发第二次和第三次愤怒的人民群众的起义。”
    社论说，“只有美帝国主义侵略军从南朝鲜撤走，朝鲜人民自己通过南北协商和南北总选举来解决朝鲜问题，才是巩固朝鲜的和平、收拾南朝鲜目前的局面、和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。”
    社论强调说，美帝国主义侵略军再没有任何理由继续赖在南朝鲜不走了，必须立即撤出南朝鲜。今天，三千万朝鲜人民在反美救国斗争的旗帜下团结一致的声势比任何时候都更加浩大。朝鲜人民决不容许美帝国主义侵略者继续在南朝鲜进行侵略的战争阴谋。
