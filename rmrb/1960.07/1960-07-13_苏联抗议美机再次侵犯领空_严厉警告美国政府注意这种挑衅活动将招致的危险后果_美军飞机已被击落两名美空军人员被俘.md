　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th (TASS dispatch): Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received on July 11th the US Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Mr. Freers, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Reilly, and the Norwegian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Gundersen, and handed them respectively the Soviet government's protest notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and Norway regarding the intrusion of a US military aircraft into Soviet airspace on July 1, 1960.
　　The full text of the Soviet government's protest note to the US government is as follows:
　　The government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics issues this note to the government of the United States of America due to the US Air Force aircraft's serious intrusion into Soviet airspace once again.
　　On July 1, 1960, Soviet air defense observation posts detected an unidentified military aircraft approaching the Soviet border near the Kola Peninsula in the Barents Sea. In order to identify the nationality of this aircraft and to warn it that it had intruded into Soviet airspace, a fighter plane was immediately scrambled.
　　The Soviet fighter pilot determined that the unidentified aircraft was a bomber with US Air Force markings. This US aircraft intruded into the Soviet border 22 kilometers north of Svyatoy Nos and flew towards the city of Arkhangelsk.
　　The intruding aircraft, disregarding the signals from the Soviet fighter plane to follow the Soviet plane and land, continued to penetrate deeper into Soviet airspace. In accordance with the orders issued to the Soviet armed forces regarding the defense of the Soviet borders, the intruding aircraft was shot down at 18:03 Moscow time over Soviet territorial waters east of Svyatoy Nos.
　　Some time later, Soviet ships found two members of the downed US aircraft in Soviet territorial waters. They are: the aircraft's navigator, US Air Force Lieutenant John Richard McKone, born in Missouri in 1932; and the second pilot, US Air Force Lieutenant Freeman Bruce Olmstead, born in New York in 1935.
　　According to McKone and Olmstead's confession, the aircraft they were piloting was an "RB-47" six-engine bomber reconnaissance aircraft, belonging to the US Strategic Intelligence Air Force detachment attached to the 55th Wing, performing a special military reconnaissance mission. The aircraft was equipped with two 20mm cannons, with a full complement of ammunition, and a cabin was equipped with specialized reconnaissance photography equipment and radio-electronic instruments.
　　According to Olmstead and McKone, besides them, there were four others on the aircraft: Captain Palm, the aircraft commander, and three officers - Captain Puss, an expert in photography and radio-electronic instruments, as well as Lieutenants Goforth and Phillips. The body of Captain Palm, the first pilot of the downed aircraft, was found by Soviet ships on a rubber boat and brought on board. The search for other personnel on the aircraft has been fruitless.
　　According to the confessions of Olmstead and McKone, the "RB-47" aircraft they were piloting took off from the US military base in Brize Norton, England, at 10:00 Greenwich time on July 1, 1960, flying along the route of the Norwegian and Soviet northern borders. It was ordered to return to its original base in England after completing its mission, where the US Air Force detachment to which the aircraft belonged was stationed. Before the aircraft took off, Major Debel, the commander of the Brize Norton base detachment, warned the crew that the flight should be kept strictly secret, and therefore the crew was prohibited from maintaining regular radio contact with the base.
　　Barely two months ago, the US government's aggressive actions, manifested in the deliberate intrusion of US military aircraft into the Soviet Union for espionage purposes and the declaration of such provocative actions as US state policy, led to the disruption of the summit meeting and were condemned by world public opinion. The incident of US military aircraft violating Soviet airspace again proves that the US government is continuing to follow the path of harming the cause of peace. Now everyone sees the true value of the solemn assurances made by the US government and President Eisenhower himself that the President had ordered the US Air Force to cease espionage flights over Soviet airspace.
　　Thus, the question arises: what is the purpose of the US Air Force continuing to carry out its policy of violating Soviet airspace? There can only be one answer. The actions of the US government are a deliberate violation of recognized norms of international law, a policy of deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation and exacerbating the threat of war.
　　This time, as before, the United States continues to use the military bases it has established on the territory of other countries—allies of the US military bloc—to carry out aggressive activities against the Soviet Union.
　　It seems that the US government does not value the lives of US pilots and consciously wants them to sacrifice themselves when conducting espionage flights over the Soviet Union. If the fate of US pilots can be considered an internal affair of the United States, then the serious threat posed by the US government's provocative activities to universal peace is not.
　　This is a problem that the Soviet Union, or any other country that sincerely cares about maintaining peace, cannot ignore.
　　Given that this act of border violation was crushed at the initial stage, the Soviet government deems it possible to limit itself to destroying the aircraft that violated the border and handing over the surviving personnel to the courts for severe punishment in accordance with Soviet law.
　　At the same time, the Soviet government sternly warns the US government of the dangerous consequences that will be caused by the continued provocative activities of US aircraft, for which the US government will be responsible.
　　The US government cannot be unaware of the consequences that its deliberate policy of provocation against the Soviet Union will lead to. It may be able to conceal this from its own people with this or that excuse. However, the Soviet government considers it its duty to remind the US government that it has no right to gamble with the fate of the world. The American people should also be aware of this warning, and should also know that the Soviet Union has consistently done everything possible to prevent the peoples of all countries from suffering the disasters of a new war, and that the US government bears full responsibility for the severe tests the world is experiencing today.
　　The Soviet government must point out with the utmost regret that some countries—governments of the US military bloc—have not drawn the due conclusions from some well-known facts resulting from the US Air Force's aggressive actions. They allow the use of US military bases on their territories and continue to pursue a policy of participating in the above-mentioned aggressive actions, thereby bringing great danger to their own people.
　　Due to the US military aircraft's renewed violation of the Soviet border on July 1 this year, the Soviet government lodges a strong protest to the US government.
　　Moscow, July 11, 1960

　　苏联抗议美机再次侵犯领空
　　严厉警告美国政府注意这种挑衅活动将招致的危险后果
　　美军飞机已被击落两名美空军人员被俘
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科11日电：苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯7月11日接见了美国驻苏联临时代办弗里尔斯先生、英国驻苏联大使赖利爵士和挪威驻苏联大使贡德森先生，把苏联政府由于美国军用飞机1960年7月1日侵入苏联领空而向美国、英国和挪威三国政府发出的抗议照会分别交给他们。
    苏联政府给美国政府的抗议照会全文如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府由于美国空军飞机再次严重侵犯苏联领空而向美利坚合众国政府发出本照会。
    1960年7月1日，苏联防空部队对空观测哨在巴伦支海科拉半岛附近发现有一架来历不明的军用飞机向苏联国境飞来。为了辨明这架飞机的国籍以及警告它已经侵入苏联领空，一架歼击机当时起飞。
    苏联歼击机飞行员断定，这架来历不明的飞机是一架有美国空军标记的轰炸机。这架美国飞机在斯维亚托伊角以北二十二公里处侵入苏联国境，并向阿尔汉格尔市方向飞行。
    侵入国境的飞机不顾苏联歼击机要它跟随苏联飞机飞行并降落的信号，继续深入苏联领空。根据对苏联武装部队下达的关于保卫苏联国境的命令，侵入国境的飞机于莫斯科时间十八时零三分在斯维亚托伊角以东苏联领水上空被击落。
    过了一些时候，苏联船只在苏联领水找到了两名被击落的美国飞机上的人员。他们是：飞机领航员美国空军中尉约翰·里查德·麦寇恩，1932年生于密苏里州；第二驾驶员、美国空军中尉弗里曼·布鲁斯·奥姆斯特德，1935年生于纽约州。
    据麦寇恩和奥姆斯特德供认，他们驾驶的飞机是“ RB—四十七型”六发动机轰炸侦察机，属于编入第五十五联队的美国战略情报空军支队，执行特别的军事侦察性质的任务。飞机装备有两门二十毫米的大炮，大炮配备了全套弹药，有一个机舱安置着专门的侦察照相设备和无线电电子仪器。
    据奥姆斯特德和麦寇恩说，飞机上除他们以外还有四人：机长帕姆上尉和三名军官——照相和无线电电子仪器专家上尉普斯以及中尉戈福斯和中尉菲利普斯。被击落的飞机的第一驾驶员帕姆上尉的尸体，已被苏联船只在橡皮船上找到并运到船上。寻找机上其他人员的工作没有结果。
    据奥姆斯特德和麦寇恩供称，他们驾驶的“RB—四十七型”飞机于1960年7月1日格林威治时间十时从英国布利兹诺尔敦美国军事基地起飞，沿挪威和苏联北部国境的航线飞行，它奉命在完成任务后返回英国原基地，这架飞机所属的美国空军支队驻扎在那里。布利兹诺尔敦基地支队的司令德贝耳少校曾在飞机起飞前警告机上人员：飞行应当严格保密，因此禁止机上人员同基地保持定期无线电联系。
    只不过两个月以前，美国采取的、表现在美国军用飞机有意抱着间谍目的侵入苏联和表现在宣布这类挑衅行动是美国国策这两件事上的侵略行动，导致了美国政府破坏最高级会议，并受到全世界舆论的同声谴责。美国军用飞机再次破坏苏联领空的事件证明，美国政府在继续走着那条危害和平事业的道路。现在大家看到，美国政府和艾森豪威尔总统本人关于总统已经下令美国空军停止在苏联领空进行间谍飞行的郑重保证的真正价值如何。
    于是就产生了一个问题：美国空军继续执行侵犯苏联领空的政策目的何在。这只能有一个回答。美国政府的行动是对公认的国际法准则的有意的破坏，是一种旨在使局势白热化，使战争威胁加剧的蓄意挑衅的政策。
    这次同以前一样，美国继续利用它在别国——美国的军事集团盟国的领土上建立的军事基地对苏联进行侵略活动。
    看来，美国政府很不重视美国飞行员的生命，并且有意识地要他们在到苏联上空作间谍飞行时牺牲，如果说美国飞行员的命运可以被认为是美国的内政的话，那末，美国政府的挑衅活动给普遍和平造成的严重威胁却不是如此了。
    这是一个苏联、任何其他一个真诚关心维护和平的国家不能漠然视之的问题。
    鉴于这次破坏边境的行动在最初阶段就被粉碎，苏联政府认为有可能只限于消灭侵犯国境的飞机，并将活着的人员交付法庭，按照苏联的法律予以严惩。
    同时，苏联政府严厉警告美国政府注意美国飞机继续进行挑衅活动将招致的危险后果，而美国政府要对这些危险后果负责。
    美国政府不能不知道，它的蓄意向苏联挑衅的政策会导致怎样的后果。它也许可以用这种或那种理由向本国人民隐瞒这一点。但是，苏联政府认为自己有责任提醒美国政府，它没有任何权利拿世界的命运当儿戏。美国人民也应当知道这个警告，还应当知道，苏联一贯尽一切可能不使各国人民遭受新战争的灾难，世界今天经历的严重考验要由美国政府负全部责任。
    苏联政府必须极其遗憾地指出，一些国家——美国的军事集团盟国的政府没有从由于美国空军的侵略行动而产生的一些人所共知的事实中作出应有的结论。它们允许使用设在它们领土上的美国军事基地，继续奉行参与上述侵略行动的政策，从而给本国人民招致巨大的危险。
    由于美国军用飞机于今年7月1日再次破坏苏联边境，苏联政府向美国政府提出坚决的抗议。
      1960年7月11日于莫斯科
