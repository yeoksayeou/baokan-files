Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 24th. Tianjin Bicycle Factory workers, in the mass movement of learning, catching up, surpassing, and creating advanced indicators, striving for first place in five aspects: output, quality, cost, new technologies applied to production, and safety and hygiene, are overcoming the complacency of some cadres, vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution, breaking through long-standing key production problems, and significantly improving product quality.

Since the factory officially produced Flying Pigeon brand bicycles in 1951, it has won first place in quality and output in the national bicycle competitions for eight consecutive years. However, this year, in terms of output and individual quality and cost indicators, it has been surpassed by fraternal factories. After seeing the People's Daily published news at the beginning of the month that the Shanghai Bicycle Factory had the highest output and best quality in the first half of the year, they immediately bought bicycles from fraternal factories from the market, compared them with the bicycles produced by their own factory, dissected and analyzed them one by one, and conducted a special study at the Party committee meeting. They identified the main reasons why their factory's bicycles lagged behind fraternal factories in terms of paint, electroplating, and freewheel quality as being due to the complacency that has grown among some cadres this year. Therefore, the Party committee decided to adopt the method of rectification, conducting a ten-day rectification among cadres throughout the factory from July 4th to July 15th, criticizing the complacency of some cadres. At the same time, a worker representative meeting was convened, and the product quality problem was disclosed to all factory workers, launching a mass "six-check" activity of checking quality, checking output, checking the application of new technologies to production, checking raw material consumption, checking measures, and checking safety and hygiene. Combining the "six-checks," a large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters were launched among workers with the theme of "Can we strive for first place, dare we strive for first place, and how do we strive for first place?" Through the "six-checks" and debates, all factory workers established the ambition to protect the brand name, learn from the advanced indicators of advanced factories, and strive for first place in the country; branches, workshops, and groups at all levels formulated "learning, catching up, surpassing, and creating" plans and specific measures.

After the rectification ended, the ideological problems of the cadres were resolved, and leading cadres went deep into the front line of production, vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution with the workers, and resolutely solving key quality problems. In order to solve the paint quality problem, leading cadres and workers repeatedly studied and experimented, and successively adopted measures such as increasing the number of paint polishing, strengthening the grinding fineness of the paint, and regularly cleaning the paint filter, which greatly improved the gloss of the paint, catching up with fraternal factories. The electroplating workshop implemented a new grinding process and compiled the new process manual into a booklet, which was distributed to each worker, stipulating that it should be checked once a day. Now the gloss of electroplating has also exceeded the standards stipulated by fraternal factories and the state.

The preparation workshop of this factory is the workshop for rolling and forming bicycle rims and mudguards and processing various parts materials. Because more "rolling cracks" occurred during the rolling and forming process in this workshop, the rolling scrap rate has long been around 40%, which not only seriously affected the quality of the rims, mudguards, and baked paint, but also often affected the completion of the factory's product output plan due to supply problems to the next process. In this movement, the Party committee was determined to completely solve this problem. Wu Yubin, deputy secretary of the Party committee, and Zhao Wenbin, director of the factory director's office, settled in the workshop. After mobilizing the masses, conducting in-depth inspections, summarizing rolling experience, and proposing improvement measures, the "rolling crack" problem that had not been solved for a long time has been completely solved. This workshop also completed the first half-month plan for the first time this year.

    天津自行车厂批判自满情绪力争保持质量冠军
    飞鸽牌自行车精益求精
    新华社天津24日电　天津自行车厂职工在学、赶、超、创先进指标，力争产量、质量、成本、新技术用于生产和安全卫生等五个方面第一的群众运动中，克服部分干部的自满情绪，大闹技术革新和技术革命，突破了长期以来存在的生产关键问题，使产品质量有了显著提高。
    这个厂自1951年正式生产飞鸽牌自行车以来，连续八年在全国自行车评比中获得质量、产量第一。但是，今年以来，在产量和个别质量、成本指标上已被兄弟厂赶上。当他们在月初看到人民日报刊登了上海自行车厂上半年产量最多、质量最好的消息后，立即从市场上买回兄弟厂的自行车，和本厂生产的自行车对比，逐个进行解剖、分析，并在党委会上专门作了研究。他们找出本厂自行车在油漆、电镀和飞轮等质量上落后于兄弟厂的主要原因，是今年以来，部分干部滋长了自满情绪。因此党委决定采用整风的办法，从7月4日到7月15日在全厂干部中进行了为期十天的整风，批判了部分干部存在的自满情绪。同时召开了职工代表会议，把产品质量问题向全厂职工交底，掀起了一个群众性的查质量、查产量、查新技术用于生产、查原材料消耗、查措施、查安全卫生的“六查”活动。结合“六查”，以“能不能争第一、敢不敢争第一、怎样争第一”为内容，在职工中展开大鸣大放大辩论。通过“六查”和辩论，全厂职工树立了保名牌、学习先进厂先进指标、力争全国第一的雄心壮志；各分厂、车间、小组层层制订出了“学赶超创”的规划和具体措施。
    整风结束以后，干部的思想问题得到了解决，领导干部深入生产第一线，和职工一起大闹技术革新和技术革命，踏踏实实地解决质量关键问题。为了解决油漆质量问题，领导干部和工人一起反复研究试验，先后采取了增加油漆的打磨次数、加强油漆研磨细度、经常清洁油漆过滤器等措施，使油漆的光泽度大大提高，赶上了兄弟厂。电镀车间贯彻了新的研磨工艺，并将新工艺手则编印成册，发给每个工人，规定每天检查一次。现在电镀的光泽度也超过了兄弟厂和国家规定的标准。
    这个工厂的准备车间，是自行车车圈、档泥板轧制成型和各种零件材料的加工车间。这个车间因为轧制成型过程中发生“轧裂”较多，长期以来轧制报废率在40％左右，不仅严重影响车圈、档泥板和烤漆的质量，而且常因供应不上下道工序而影响到全厂产品产量计划的完成。在这次运动中，党委下决心要彻底解决这一问题。党委副书记吴玉斌和厂长办公室主任赵文斌到车间落户。经过发动群众，进行深入检查，总结了轧制经验，提出改进措施，长期没有能够解决的“轧裂”问题已经彻底解决。这个车间今年以来也第一次完成了上半月计划。
