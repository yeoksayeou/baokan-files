The All-China Youth Federation Sends Letter to Congratulate Cyprus Youth Festival
Supports the Just Struggle of the Cypriot People

This newspaper reports that the Cyprus Youth Festival is scheduled to be held on July 7th. The All-China Youth Federation wrote a letter on the 1st to the United Democratic Youth Organization of Cyprus, congratulating them on the success of the festival and expressing the support of Chinese youth for the just struggle of the Cypriot people and youth for national independence and against imperialism. The congratulatory letter begins by saying:

"At the time of the All-Cyprus Youth Festival, we would like to express our warm congratulations to the Cypriot youth on behalf of all Chinese youth, and through you. We wish you victory in your struggle to win and safeguard national independence, oppose imperialism, and defend world peace."

The letter points out, "Our Chinese youth delegation has been unreasonably obstructed by British imperialism from attending your festival this time, but this shameless conspiracy of imperialism cannot stop the growing development of the profound friendship between the youth of our two countries. At the same time, this incident also tells us that only by gaining complete independence and freedom can the Cypriot people become the true masters of their own land. The Cypriot people and youth who persist in unity and struggle will surely gain complete independence and freedom."

The letter concludes, "Chinese youth fully support the just struggle of the Cypriot people and youth to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism, and firmly believe that as long as the Cypriot youth and the people of the whole country unite as one and fight resolutely, they will surely achieve final victory."

    本报讯　塞浦路斯青年联欢节定于7月7日举行。中华全国青年联合会于1日写信给塞浦路斯统一民主青年组织，祝贺联欢节的成功并表示中国青年支持塞浦路斯人民和青年争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的正义斗争，贺信首先说：
    “在全塞浦路斯青年联欢节举行的时候，我们谨代表全中国的青年向你们并通过你们，向塞浦路斯青年表示热烈的祝贺。祝你们在争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和捍卫世界和平的斗争中取得胜利。
    贺信指出，“我们中国青年代表团这次由于英帝国主义的无理阻挠，不能前来参加你们的联欢节，但是帝国主义这种无耻阴谋是阻挡不了我们两国青年之间深厚友谊的日益发展。同时，这件事情也告诉我们，只有获得完全的独立和自由，塞浦路斯人民才能成为自己土地上真正的主人。坚持团结和斗争的塞浦路斯人民和青年一定会获得完全的独立和自由。”
    贺信最后说：“中国青年全力支持塞浦路斯人民和青年争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的正义斗争，并且深信只要塞浦路斯青年和全国人民团结一致，坚决斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。”
