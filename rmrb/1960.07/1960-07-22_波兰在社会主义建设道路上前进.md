Poland Advances on the Road of Socialist Construction
Industrial Production Has Developed Rapidly in the Sixteen Years; Increased by 9.9% in the First Half of This Year Compared with the Same Period Last Year
The Cultivated Land Occupied by Agricultural Production Cooperatives is Constantly Increasing; The Degree of Agricultural Mechanization Has Greatly Increased

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 21st: According to figures published here, Poland's current per capita industrial output is approximately 55% to 60% of the total per capita industrial output of the United Kingdom, West Germany, France, and Italy, while before liberation, this ratio was less than 20%.

In the sixteen years since the establishment of People's Poland, Poland's industry has undergone tremendous development. Compared to 1937 before liberation, the total industrial output value last year increased by 5.8 times. In the first half of this year, the total output value of public-owned industries increased by another 9.9% compared to the same period last year. Last year, Poland's coal mining volume ranked sixth in the world, and the output of the shipbuilding industry ranked eleventh in the world.

In the first half of this year, Poland's metallurgical, coal mining, chemical, cement, and other industrial sectors all overfulfilled their production plans. The production of the entire heavy industry sector increased by 15% compared to the same period last year.

Taking the chemical industry sector, which has the fastest development speed, as an example, its total output value has now increased to twelve times that before liberation. This year, the total output value of the chemical industry will increase by 13.4% compared to last year, and by 1965, the total output value will double compared to this year.

This year, Poland will have 720 large and medium-sized basic construction projects put into production. Last year, 540 large and medium-sized basic construction projects were put into production. At present, there are approximately over one thousand large and medium-sized projects under construction and expansion throughout the country, among which there are forty of the largest industrial construction projects.

According to the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, which recently closed, during Poland's next five-year plan (1961-1965), the total industrial output will increase from the originally planned 50% to 52%.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 20th: Poland's public-owned industry has already overfulfilled its total output value plan for the first half of this year by 2.4%, with a total output value increase of 9.9% compared to the first half of last year.

This was announced in a communiqué on the implementation of Poland's national economic plan for the first half of the year, published here today. The communiqué stated that, according to preliminary statistics, Poland's mining, power, chemical, and other heavy industry sectors had all completed more than half of their annual plans by the end of June. The growth rate of production in the chemical and some other heavy industry sectors exceeded the average growth rate of the entire industry. The production plans for most means of production products have been completed, and the production plans for many consumer goods have been overfulfilled.

In agriculture, the total sown area has not changed much compared to last year. The number of livestock increased by 4% compared to the same period last year, and the number of pigs increased by 12% compared to June last year. As of June 30th, there were 2,142 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, and the land area owned by the cooperatives increased by 15% compared to June last year.

In the first half of this year, 3,900 tractors were supplied to agriculture, 88% more than in the same period last year. In June, the number of tractors in the country reached approximately 62,300.

In the first half of the year, the investment amount of Poland's public-owned economy reached 31.1 billion zlotys (Polish currency), an increase of approximately 5.9% compared to the first half of last year. The total value of foreign trade reached 5.292 billion foreign exchange zlotys, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year. The total export value increased by 9.3%.

    波兰在社会主义建设道路上前进
    工业生产十六年来发展迅速　今年上半年比去年同期增加9.9％
    农业生产合作社所占耕地不断增加　农业机械化程度大大提高
    新华社华沙21日电　根据这里发表的数字表明，波兰目前按人口平均计算的工业产量已经大约占英国、西德、法国和意大利工业产量总和（按人口平均计算）的55％到60％，而解放前这个比数还不到20％。
    在人民波兰建立的十六年中，波兰的工业有了巨大的发展。同解放前1937年相比，去年工业总产值增加了五点八倍。今年上半年公营工业总产值又比去年同期增加了9.9％。还在去年，波兰的采煤量就已占世界第六位，造船工业的产量占世界第十一位。
    今年上半年波兰的冶金、采煤、化学、水泥等工业部门都超额完成了生产计划。整个重工业部门的生产比去年同期增加了15％。
    拿发展速度最快的化学工业部门来说，它的总产值现在已增为解放前的十二倍。今年化学工业总产值将比去年增加13.4％，而到1965年总产值又要比今年增加一倍。
    波兰今年将有七百二十个大中型基本建设项目投入生产，去年投入生产的大中型基本建设项目有五百四十个。目前全国正在新建和扩建的大中型项目约有一千多个，其中最大型的工业建设项目有四十个。
    根据最近闭幕的波兰统一工人党中央第五次全体会议决定，波兰下一个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，工业总产量将从原定增长50％提高到增长52％。
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰公营工业已经超额2.4％完成了今年上半年总产值计划，总产值比去年上半年增加了9.9％。
    这是今天这里公布的有关波兰国民经济计划上半年执行情况公报所宣布的。公报中说，据初步统计，波兰的采掘、动力、化学和其他重工业部门6月底都完成了全年计划的一半以上。化学和其他一些重工业部门生产的增长速度，超过了整个工业的平均增长速度。大多数生产资料产品的生产计划都已经完成，许多消费品的生产计划已经超额完成。
    在农业方面，总的播种面积同去年没有多大改变。牲畜头数比去年同期增加了4％，猪的头数比去年6月份增加12％。到6月30日为止，全国有二千一百四十二个农业生产合作社，合作社拥有的土地面积比去年6月份增加了15％。
    今年上半年，供应农业的拖拉机有三千九百台，比去年同期多供应88％。6月份全国拖拉机的数目约达六万二千三百台。
    上半年，波兰公营经济的投资额达三百一十一亿兹罗提（波币），即比去年上半年增加约5.9％。对外贸易总值达五十二亿九千二百万外汇兹罗提，比去年同期增加了11％。出口总值增加了9.3％。
