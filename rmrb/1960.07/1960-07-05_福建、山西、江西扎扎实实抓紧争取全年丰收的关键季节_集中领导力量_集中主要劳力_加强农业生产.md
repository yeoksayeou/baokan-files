Fuzhou, July 4th: Under the guidance of the idea of agriculture as the foundation, various parts of Fujian are concentrating their main forces and launching a new upsurge of production to fight hard for the three months of July, August, and September, and strive for a full agricultural harvest throughout the year.

At present, cadres at all levels throughout the province are generally going deep into the grassroots, participating in production, and leading production. The labor force invested in summer harvesting and planting, such as harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice, has reached about 80%. In the southern Fujian area, which was hit by typhoons, heavy rains, and floods in early June, the vast numbers of cadres and masses, under the slogan of "Make up for the loss of early rice with late rice, and make up for the loss of staple grains with miscellaneous grains," are carefully harvesting early rice and rushing to plant and expand the planting of late rice, miscellaneous grains, and other crops. The Nanping, Fu'an, Longyan, Minhou, and Jinjiang special districts are also launching unprecedented summer harvesting and planting preparations, carrying out large-scale post-processing management of early rice, and massively expanding the planting of late rice, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains. Up to now, the province has rushed to plant and expand the planting of more than 9 million mu of late rice, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains.

In order to concentrate the main forces and further implement the production policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, party committees in various places are doing everything possible to grasp the arrangement of labor forces, ensuring that during the crucial period of July, August, and September to win a bumper harvest for the whole year, about 80% of the labor force is used in agricultural production. First, temporarily suspend or postpone all projects that can be suspended or postponed. For example, after the Longyan Prefectural Committee adopted this measure, the labor force put into agricultural production increased from about 60% to more than 70%. Second, transfer a large number of cadres to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, and to uniformly lead industrial, commercial, transportation, cultural, educational, and health departments to closely serve agricultural production in all aspects. According to incomplete statistics, industrial and commercial departments throughout the province have manufactured and supplied more than 2 million pieces of various summer harvesting and planting tools to rural areas in the past month.

In order to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production and conscientiously implement the production policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, cadres at all levels have also generally improved their leadership style and working methods, going deep into the grassroots, going deep into reality, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses, and solidly grasping various production tasks to the end. After Zhangping County promoted the leadership work experience of the "two-five system," the number of county committee members who went deep into the grassroots in the county increased by nearly double compared with the past; 99% of the commune and brigade cadres regularly participate in production and lead production, making a new atmosphere in the county's rural areas where agriculture is the prominent center and all departments closely follow. On the basis of going deep into the front line to participate in production and lead production, more than 10,000 cadres in Minhou County have further developed into making intimate friends with the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, so that problems in production can be discovered and solved in time, further strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses, and promoting production. All the cadres of Luoxi Commune in Jinjiang County eat in the public canteen together with the commune members, so that they can grasp production when they go out and grasp life when they enter the door. The production of the entire commune continues to leap forward, the canteen is getting better and better, and the lives of the commune members are continuously improving, and their enthusiasm is getting higher and higher.

While concentrating the main forces to vigorously grasp agricultural production, various places are also vigorously grasping key measures, mobilizing and leading the masses to thoroughly carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The first is to seize the opportunity, rush to harvest summer-ripening crops, carry out a fine harvesting and careful threshing movement, and harvest all the fruits of labor in the first half of the year. Longxi, Haicheng, and other counties have adopted methods such as rushing to harvest early rice flooded by floods as soon as possible, cutting and threshing nearby, and adding enclosures to rice buckets, reducing the loss by an average of 30 to 40 jin of grain per mu. The second is to continue to expand the planting area of late rice and sweet potatoes, vigorously engage in intercropping and interplanting, and make full use of mountain slopes and gaps to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains, vegetables, melons, and beans. Changting County has always practiced rice-sweet potato rotation or rice-bean rotation, and rarely plants double-season late rice. Now, it is determined to change the old farming habits, change some of the original planned sweet potatoes, economic crops, miscellaneous grains, and other crops planted in paddy fields to mountain slopes, and free up paddy fields to expand the planting of 20,000 mu of consecutive late rice. Third, carry out a summer blitz to accumulate fertilizer to ensure that the needs of topdressing early rice are met, and accumulate sufficient base fertilizer for autumn harvest. Fourth, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution centered on tool reform, and accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization. Ningde County has established more than 270 new-style agricultural implement field farming stations throughout the county, which are planned to be used, repaired, and continuously promoted in a concentrated manner by region, so that the total number of new-style agricultural implements promoted in the county has increased by 84.9% compared with last year, greatly improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of agricultural production. Various communes in the suburbs of Nanping City have established more than 180 field hydropower joint power stations, with an average of two per brigade, making full use of the low-water-level hydropower at the field head to drive threshing machines, winnowing machines, and dryers to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of threshing, winnowing, and drying.

Taiyuan, July 4th: The first secretary at each level takes command, and party members and cadres take the lead everywhere. Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels in Shanxi Province go deep into the front line, going wherever there are difficulties, and strengthening the leadership of agricultural production.

At the end of June, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, which deployed the current agricultural production in accordance with the policy of agriculture as the center. The meeting put forward the call to concentrate leadership strength and all manpower and material resources, and launch a massive movement to fight drought, protect seedlings, conserve and prepare for famine. The meeting proposed three steps for this year's agricultural production: First, vigorously grasp the fight against drought and protect seedlings, and make the greatest efforts to expand the summer planting area by using all available land; Second, if the drought continues to develop, vigorously grasp late autumn crops; Third, concentrate forces to ensure the harvest of 15 million mu of water land, 7 million mu of semi-water land, and 10 million mu of low-lying, gully and shady land in the province. The meeting also proposed that, in order to ensure this year's agricultural production, the existing water conservancy projects and industrial capital construction in the province should be reviewed item by item, reasonably arranged, and 400,000 laborers should be transferred back to the front line of agricultural production. At the same time, a high tide of industry, transportation, commerce, education, and soldiers supporting agricultural production should be set off throughout the province.

After the conclusion of the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities and counties held emergency telephone conferences to deploy the leadership of agricultural production and the current drought-fighting and seedling-protecting movement in accordance with the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee. The Jinbei Special Zone established drought and flood prevention headquarters from top to bottom, and the management area and production team established drought-fighting command posts and command teams, implementing the measures of the first secretary at each level taking command, the members dividing the areas and contracting them, and leading cadres personally commanding operations on the front line. In the past ten days, more than 100,000 cadres at all levels in the entire region have gone to the front line of agricultural production. In the Jinzhong Special Zone, 17 working groups led by the secretary of the prefectural committee and the commissioner have arrived in the areas most severely affected by drought. More than 10,000 special zone, county, and commune cadres have been dispatched throughout the region. At the same time, the working method of "the three-level secretaries and local experts meeting in the fields" has been adopted to further improve the leadership. Five thousand three hundred commune cadres are working and leading production at the same time. The Jinnan area has also transferred more than 50,000 cadres, led by the secretaries of party committees at all levels, going wherever there are difficulties, and going wherever there are great difficulties, and has generally promoted the "two-five system" leadership experience of the Wuqiao County Party Committee in Hebei Province, participating in production and leading production. More than 50,000 cadres in the Jinzhongnan Special Zone have generally implemented a series of systems such as office work in the fields and meetings in the fields to strengthen leadership. At present, the number of people concentrated on agricultural production centered on fighting drought, protecting seedlings, rushing to harvest, and rushing to plant in the entire region has reached more than 850,000, accounting for more than 80% of the total rural labor force.

Thanks to the timely strengthening of the leadership of agricultural production by party committees at all levels, in the past half month, the high tide of drought-fighting and seedling-protecting, rushing to harvest, and rushing to plant has been one wave after another throughout the province. In the Jinnan area, more than 80% of the 3.2 million mu of cotton fields have been cultivated three times, and more than 1.6 million mu have been cultivated four times or more. 120,000 mu of cotton fields have been watered. Under the slogan of rivers ascending mountains and dead water lakes turning into living water lakes, the Jinbei area has established 411 irrigation stations in the past week, expanding the irrigated area by 156,000 mu. At present, this special zone has more than 490 drainage and irrigation machines, more than 6,380 waterwheels, and more than 10,000 windlasses operating day and night, irrigating fields. As of June 26, the irrigated area had reached 1.21 million mu.

Nanchang, July 4th: Jiangxi Province will concentrate more than 80% of its labor force to strengthen agricultural production.

In order to continue to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and effectively grasp the upcoming early rice harvest and summer planting, the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee decided that all parts of the province must currently concentrate more than 80% of the labor force to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. The specific requirements are: First, arrange labor forces in all walks of life in a coordinated manner with agriculture as the focus. For various productions other than agriculture, on the premise of not affecting their normal production, adopt appropriate compression and methods of replacing men with women and replacing the weak with the strong to extract all possible and main labor forces to strengthen agriculture. Second, temporary off-site labor forces engaged in sideline occupations and transportation, except for those that should be retained in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Party Committee, should be transferred back to their original communes and production teams to participate in agricultural production. Third, fully tap labor potential, conduct a comprehensive inspection of the existing rural labor force, and mobilize all semi-labor and incidental labor forces that can participate in agricultural production to participate in the early rice harvest and summer planting. Fourth, on the basis of concentrating labor forces to strengthen agriculture, further adjust and improve labor organizations according to the characteristics of agricultural work, establish and improve the production responsibility system, and give full play to the production expertise and production enthusiasm of each labor force.

In order to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, the Provincial Party Committee also stipulated that the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally take command and focus on agriculture, and cadres at all levels, except for cadres on the iron and steel front, should be transferred down as much as possible to enrich the rural grassroots, participate in production, and lead production.

Party committees at all levels throughout the province resolutely implement the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. While the first secretary takes command and a large number of cadres go to the countryside and communes to strengthen the leadership of agriculture, they are transferring labor forces to strengthen agricultural production. The counties in the Ji'an Special Zone alone have transferred and excavated more than 100,000 labor forces from all sides to enhance the agricultural front. In addition to transferring 37,000 temporary off-site labor forces back to agriculture, Ji'an County has adopted methods of squeezing (squeezing from commune-run industries and sideline occupations), replacing (implementing the replacement of the weak with the strong, replacing men with women, and replacing agricultural novices with agricultural veterans for non-agricultural production labor forces), stopping (suspending industries and sideline occupations that can be suspended temporarily according to the agricultural season during the current busy farming season), and supporting (mobilizing non-agricultural populations such as market town residents to support agricultural production) in various communes to extract more than 9,000 labor forces to strengthen agriculture.

As a large number of labor forces are turning to agriculture, various places are seizing the adjustment and improvement of labor organizations, actively investing in fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing, and tool preparation to welcome the early rice harvest and summer planting.

    福建、山西、江西扎扎实实抓紧争取全年丰收的关键季节
    集中领导力量　集中主要劳力　加强农业生产
    统筹安排各行各业劳力，80％左右的劳动力用到农业第一线
    各级干部普遍深入基层，工商交通文教等部门密切为农业服务
    本报福州4日电　在以农业为基础的思想指导下，福建各地集中主要力量，掀起了大战7、8、9三个月，力争全年农业丰收的生产新高潮。
    目前全省各级干部普遍深入基层，参加生产领导生产，各地投入抢收早稻抢插晚稻等夏收夏种的劳动力已达80％左右。6月上旬遭受了台风、暴雨和洪水袭击的闽南地区，广大干部和群众，在“早稻损失晚稻补，主粮损失杂粮补”的口号下，正在精打细收早稻和抢种扩种晚稻、杂粮等作物；南平、福安、龙岩、闽侯、晋江各专区也都展开了空前规模的夏收夏种准备工作，大搞早稻后期加工管理，大量扩种晚稻甘薯和杂粮。到目前止，全省已抢种扩种晚稻、甘薯杂粮九百多万亩。
    为了集中主要力量，进一步贯彻以农业为基础的生产方针，各地党委都千方百计地大抓劳力安排工作，保证在7、8、9月夺取全年大丰收的关键时期，有80％左右的劳力用到农业生产上来。首先暂时停办或缓办一切可以停办或缓办的工程。例如龙岩地委采取这一措施后，投入农业生产的劳力即由60％左右增加到70％以上。其次，抽调大批干部下乡加强领导农业生产，和统一领导工业、商业、交通运输、文教卫生等部门，从各方面密切为农业生产服务。据不完全统计，全省各地工业、商业部门在最近一个月中制造和供应农村的各种夏收夏种的工具即达两百多万部（件）。
    为了加强农业生产领导，认真贯彻以农业为基础的生产方针，各级干部还普遍改进领导作风和工作方法，深入基层深入实际和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，扎扎实实地把各项生产抓紧抓到底。漳平县推广了“二五制”的领导工作经验后，全县二十四个县委委员中深入到基层的人比过去增加近一倍；公社大队干部99％作到经常参加生产领导生产，使全县农村出现农业中心突出、各部门紧紧跟上的新气象。闽侯县一万多个干部在深入第一线参加生产领导生产的基础上进一步发展为和广大贫农、下中农结交知心朋友，这样生产中的问题一经出现就能够及时发现和解决，进一步密切党群干群关系，促进生产。晋江县罗溪公社干部全部和社员一道在公共食堂吃饭，作到出门抓生产入门抓生活，全社生产不断跃进，食堂也愈办愈好，社员生活不断得到改善，干劲越来越高。
    在集中主要力量大抓农业生产同时，各地都大抓关键措施，发动和带领群众扎扎实实地深入开展增产节约运动。首先是抓紧时机，抢收夏熟作物，开展精收细打运动，把上半年的劳动果实全部收获归仓。龙溪、海澄等县对洪水淹过的早稻，采取及早抢收顺势收割就近翻打和稻桶加围等办法，平均每亩减少损失三、四十斤谷子。其次是继续扩大晚稻番薯种植面积，大搞套种间种并充分利用山坡隙地扩种杂粮蔬菜和瓜豆。长汀县一向是实行稻薯连作或稻豆连作制的，很少种植双季晚稻，现在下决心改变旧的耕作习惯，把部分原先计划种植在水田里的番薯经济作物、杂粮等作物改种到山坡地上，腾出水田扩种连作晚稻两万亩。第三，开展夏季突击积肥运动，保证满足早稻追肥需要，并为秋季丰收积足基肥。第四，大搞以工具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，加速实现农业机械化半机械化。宁德县已在全县范围内建立了二百七十多个新式农具田间耕作站，有计划地分片集中使用、检修和继续推广新式农具，使全县新式农具推广总数比去年增加了84.9％，大大提高了农业生产的机械化半机械化程度。南平市郊各个公社建立田头水力联合动力站一百八十多处，平均每个大队有两个，充分利用田头的低水位水力带动脱谷机、扬净机、烘干器实现打谷、风扬、烘干机械化半机械化。
    本报太原4日电　层层第一书记挂帅，处处党员、干部带头，山西省各级党组织领导干部深入第一线，哪里困难就到哪里去，加强对农业生产的领导。
    6月底，中共山西省委召开省委扩大会议，根据农业为中心的方针，部署了当前的农业生产。会议提出集中领导力量和一切人力、物力，开展声势浩大的抗旱保苗节约备荒运动的号召。会议提出今年农业生产的三步打算：第一步：大抓抗旱保苗，利用一切空隙土地，尽最大努力扩大夏播面积；第二步：如果旱灾继续发展，即大抓晚秋作物；第三步：集中力量，保证全省一千五百万亩水地、七百万亩半水地和一千万亩下湿、沟坎背阴地的收获。会议还提出，为了保证今年的农业生产，要对全省现有的水利工程和工业基本建设进行逐项审查，合理安排，抽调四十万个劳力回到农业生产第一线上去。同时，要在全省掀起一个工、交、商、学、兵支援农业生产的高潮。
    省委扩大会议结束以后，各地、县召开了紧急电话会议，根据省委扩大会议的精神，对加强农业生产和当前抗旱保苗运动的领导问题作了部署。晋北专区从上到下分别建立了抗旱防汛指挥部，管理区和生产队成立抗旱指挥所和指挥组，实行层层第一书记挂帅，委员分片包干，领导干部亲临前线指挥作战的措施，一旬以来，全区已经有各级干部十万多人开赴农业生产第一线。在晋中专区，由地委书记和专员率领的十七个工作组已经到达干旱最严重的地区。全区已经出动了一万多名专区、县和公社干部，同时采取“三级书记和土专家在田间会师”的工作方法，进一步改进了领导。有五千三百名公社干部作到了一面劳动，一面领导生产。晋南地区也抽调五万多名干部，在各级党委书记率领下，哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里困难大就到哪里去，并且普遍推行了河北省吴桥县委的“二五制”领导经验，参加生产领导生产。晋中南专区的五万多名干部，普遍实行了办公到田、会议到田等一系列制度，加强领导。目前，全区集中到以抗旱保苗、抢收抢种为中心的农业生产上的人数达八十五万多人，占农村总劳力的80％以上。
    由于各级党委及时地加强了对农业生产的领导，最近半个月来，全省抗旱保苗、抢收、抢种工作的高潮一浪接一浪。晋南区三百二十万亩棉田中耕三次的已达80％以上，生产方中耕四次以上的达一百六十多万亩，有十二万亩棉田浇了水。晋北区在河水上山、死水湖变活水湖的口号下，最近一周中建立了四百一十一个灌溉站，扩大浇地面积十五万六千亩。目前，这个专区有四百九十多台排灌机械、六千三百八十多部水车和一万多个辘轳在昼夜转动，浇灌田地。到6月26日，浇地面积已达一百二十一万亩。
    本报南昌4日电　江西省将集中80％以上的劳动力来加强农业生产。
    为了继续贯彻以农业为基础的方针，切实抓好即将到来的早稻收割和夏种，中共江西省委常委扩大会议决定：全省各地当前必须集中80％以上的劳动力，加强农业生产第一线。具体要求：一、以农业为重点统筹安排各行各业劳动力。对农业以外的各项生产，在不影响其正常生产的前提下，采取适当压缩和以女换男、以弱换强的办法，抽出一切可能抽出的劳动力和主要劳动力来加强农业。二、临时外调搞副业、运输的劳动力，除按照省委规定应该留下的以外，都调回原公社、生产队参加农业生产。三、充分挖掘劳动潜力，对现有农村劳动力进行一次全面检查摸底，把一切能参加农业生产的半劳力、附带劳力都动员起来投入早稻收割和夏种。四、在集中劳动力加强农业的基础上，根据农活特点进一步调整与健全劳动组织，建立与健全生产责任制，充分发挥每个劳动力的生产特长和生产积极性。
    为了加强对农业生产的领导，省委还规定各级党委第一书记必须亲自挂帅重点抓农业，各级干部除钢铁战线的干部以外，能抽调下去的都尽量抽调下去，充实农村基层，参加生产，领导生产。
    全省各级党委坚决贯彻省委指示，在第一书记挂帅、大批干部下乡下社加强对农业领导的同时，正抽调劳动力加强农业生产。仅吉安专区各县即已从各方抽调和挖掘出劳动力十万多人，增强到农业战线。吉安县除将临时外调的三万七千名劳力调回农业以外，各公社又采取挤（从社办工业、副业上挤）、换（对非农业生产的劳动力实行以弱换强、以女换男、以农业生手换农业熟手）、停（根据农事季节在当前农忙时，凡可暂停的工业、副业暂时停下来）、支（动员墟镇居民等非农业人口支援农业生产）等办法，抽调出九千多名劳力来加强农业。
    随着大批劳动力转向农业，各地正抓紧调整与健全劳动组织，积极投入积肥造肥和工具准备，迎接早稻收割和夏种。（附图片）
