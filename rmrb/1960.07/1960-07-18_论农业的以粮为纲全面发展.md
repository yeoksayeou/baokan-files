        A New Stage of Taking Grain as the Key Link and Promoting All-Round Development
    Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, with the consolidation and development of the People's Communes, the agricultural front in Jilin Province has entered a new stage of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At present, we should earnestly summarize the experience of this new stage in order to further bring into play the superiority of the People's Communes and promote a better overall leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    In the past two years, Jilin Province, like all other parts of the country, has achieved successive great leaps forward in agricultural production. In 1959, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, it overcame severe spring drought and various natural disasters, and achieved an even more comprehensive leap forward. Compared to the great leap forward of 1958, the total agricultural output value of the province in 1959 increased by 17.2%, and the total output of grain and soybeans increased by 7.6%, of which the total output of soybeans (most of which is commercial grain) increased by 21.2%.
    On the premise of taking grain as the key link, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all made great achievements. In 1959, the afforestation area was 1.4 times the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period. The number of pigs increased by 24.7% compared to 1958, and other large and small livestock also increased significantly compared to 1958. The total output value of sideline production increased by 1.7 times compared to 1958. The total output of fishery increased by 17% compared to 1958. The main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan were basically achieved three years ahead of schedule.
    The all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has greatly increased grain production, ensured market supply, increased the income of commune members, and supported national construction. The province's commercial grain increased by 7.9% in 1959 compared to 1958, and the grain commercialization rate reached 40.8%. The total purchase amount of agricultural and sideline native products (excluding grain, soybeans, and oil crops) in 1959 increased by 69.7% compared to 1958. The increase in the commodity volume of agricultural products has first of all provided a large amount of raw materials for industry. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the province with agricultural products as raw materials increased by more than 30% compared to 1958. Secondly, it guaranteed market supply and increased the supply of non-staple foods in cities and industrial and mining areas. For example, the supply of vegetables in 1959 increased by one to two times compared to 1958. These facts eloquently prove that the policy pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that the development of the national economy should be based on agriculture is completely correct.
    The practice of continuous leaps forward in the past two years shows that a new stage of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development has emerged on the agricultural production front in Jilin Province. First of all, after the struggle between the two roads and the extensive and in-depth education movement on the General Line for Socialist Construction, the political consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been greatly enhanced, their trust in the superiority of the socialist collective economy has become stronger, and they have a clearer understanding of the new situation of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of agriculture, thereby overcoming the erroneous ideas of single management of small-scale peasant economy and emphasizing agriculture over animal husbandry or emphasizing animal husbandry over agriculture, and laying an ideological foundation for the all-round development of agriculture. Secondly, the great leap forward in agriculture and the development and consolidation of rural People's Communes in the past two years have provided a strong organizational guarantee and a sufficient material basis for the all-round development of agriculture with grain as the key link. The People's Commune is an organization that unifies politics, economy, military affairs, and culture. It is not only conducive to strengthening the unified leadership of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but also conducive to overall planning, rational utilization of resources, and large-scale development of mountains, rivers, grass, and trees. In particular, the People's Communes have partial ownership by the commune and the continuous increase of public accumulation, and the gradual expansion of various capital constructions have created favorable conditions for the all-round development with grain as the key link. At the same time, the commune is not only the organizer of collective production, but also the organizer of collective life, implementing a distribution system that combines wages and supply, running public canteens and other collective welfare undertakings on a large scale, liberating a large number of female laborers, and improving the labor enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of all commune members. It is convenient to uniformly arrange labor force, divide labor and specialize, which can not only develop agricultural production, but also engage in a variety of economic activities, thereby achieving the goal of making the best use of people's talents, land, and materials.
    In the past two years, we have gained the following experiences in the all-round development of agriculture with grain as the key link.

                  Ideology First
    We must fully realize that the fundamental policy of our country's development of the national economy is to base it on agriculture, and to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously on the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This is a correct fundamental policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to solve the relationship between the development of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, and it is also a completely correct road that has been tested by practice to realize socialist industrialization in our country. This is a major development of Marxism-Leninism by Comrade Mao Zedong. Only by vigorously developing agriculture can we rapidly develop industry to gradually meet the needs of people's lives; can we expand the supply of industrial raw materials, expand the market for industrial products (including heavy industrial products), and the source of capital accumulation; and can we enable industry to better support agriculture, realize the technical transformation of agriculture, and free up more labor force to support the development of industry. Therefore, the view that the rapid development of agriculture is incompatible with the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry is completely wrong. Rapidly developing agriculture will not only not hinder, but will greatly promote the development of heavy industry. They are mutually conditional, mutually promoting, and complementary.
    Jilin Province, in accordance with the central government's policy and based on the characteristics of the province, has determined that agriculture should take grain and soybeans as the key link, forestry and animal husbandry as the characteristics, vigorously develop diversified operations, and promote the all-round leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    In order to implement the above policies, we have constantly criticized various erroneous ideas in the development of diversified operations, launched a struggle between the two lines and two methods, and fundamentally guaranteed a series of victories.
    Regarding the relationship between taking grain and soybeans as the key link and the all-round development of diversified operations, we believe that we must first implement the policy of simultaneously promoting multiple harvests and high-yield harvests, ensuring the completion of the grain and soybean production plan, and increasing the average per capita grain possession and commercial soybean production of the rural population. On this premise, we must conscientiously implement the policy of giving equal importance to farming and animal husbandry, and simultaneously promoting self-sufficiency production and commercial production; while developing farming, we must comprehensively and extensively develop animal husbandry with pig raising as the first priority, actively develop diversified operations, increase the income of commune members, increase the public accumulation of the commune, ensure market needs, and support national construction. Neither of the above two can be reversed in importance or abandoned partially.
    Some people once believed that: "To vigorously develop diversified operations, it is not necessary to take grain and soybeans as the key link. Whatever makes money quickly should be done, and whatever the peasants are willing to do should be done." This is a reflection of the management thinking of rich middle peasants, and it is also a reflection of the remaining individual economic thinking. It violates the law of planned and proportional development of the socialist economy. Grain is the foundation of all industries, and it is a major issue related to the food of all people. Facts have proved that it is impossible to do a good job in diversified operations without developing grain production. For example, the Dashanzuizi People's Commune in Dunhua County was originally a rich and beautiful mountainous area, not only with fertile land, but also rich in mountain products, with Tala Lake and Mudan Lake, which are rich in fish and water caltrop. Despite the fact that the natural conditions here are so superior, in the era of small-scale peasant economy, people only cared about fishing and neglected grain production, so grain production was very low, and some people took water caltrop from the lake to fill their stomachs, eating until their gums turned blue and their lips turned black, so outsiders called them "black mouths." Since the cooperation, this situation has gradually changed; however, diversified operations have not been fully developed in the first few years. Before the commune, the 580 households here had to be supplied with more than 300,000 jin of grain by the state every year. After the establishment of the commune, they carried out overall planning and comprehensive arrangements based on the mountainous area's production policy of "ensuring grain self-sufficiency with surplus and vigorously developing diversified operations," which rapidly increased grain production, and other industries also developed accordingly. In 1959, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. They not only achieved self-sufficiency in food rations, but also sold nearly 700,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The commune members happily said: "Black mouths" have become "white mouths." At the same time, they also built two large weirs with a length of 2,100 meters, completely controlling the fish population, and fishing as they pleased all year round, turning the poor mountain ditch into a land of fish and rice.
    Some people also once believed that: "In a region, only single management can be carried out, and diversified operations will cause mutual contradictions." This idea is due to insufficient understanding of the new situation of agricultural production, and it is essentially a reflection of the single management thinking of small-scale peasant economy. These people have neither seen the superior conditions provided by the People's Communes for comprehensive management and all-round development, nor do they understand the inevitable trend of this development. They are accustomed to observing problems with a metaphysical viewpoint, so they cannot understand the internal connections between various industries in rural areas. If this idea is not clarified, the Party's policies cannot be implemented well, and it will inevitably lead to a bias of emphasizing agriculture over animal husbandry or even abandoning agriculture for animal husbandry and sideline occupations.
    As early as 1934, in his article "Our Economic Policy," Comrade Mao Zedong said when talking about agricultural production: "It not only needs to solve the most important grain problem, but also needs to solve the supply problem of raw materials for daily necessities such as clothing, sugar, and paper, namely cotton, hemp, sugar cane, and bamboo. The cultivation of forests and the increase of livestock production are also important parts of agriculture." We must comprehensively arrange the layout of agricultural production in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, so that various undertakings of agricultural production promote each other and develop comprehensively. It should be pointed out that the all-round development of agriculture with grain as the key link is determined by the needs of urban and rural people for grain and non-staple foods, as well as the needs of light industry for raw materials. From the actual situation in Jilin Province, due to the great development of heavy industry, forestry industry, and local industry, the continuous expansion of transportation and basic construction teams, the large number of rural labor forces entering cities and industrial and mining areas, and the rapid increase of employed personnel in cities, all require agriculture to supply more grain and various agricultural products; and with the continuous improvement of living standards, the rural people's demand for agricultural products is also increasing. More than 60% of the raw materials for light industry in Jilin Province come from agricultural products. Taking grain and soybeans as the key link and developing diversified operations can provide sufficient raw materials for light industry, and light industry will produce high-quality, low-priced, rich, and colorful products to ensure the growing needs of urban people. Agricultural production in Jilin Province must not only meet the needs of urban and rural people in the province, but also undertake the glorious task of supporting the whole country and exporting. Therefore, the all-round development of agriculture with grain as the key link has become an inevitable trend.
    Many facts prove that comprehensive management and all-round development with grain and soybeans as the key link not only do not conflict with each other, but also can promote each other. For example, the Shuguang People's Commune in Hailong County has 22 management districts. Before the commune, due to the small organizational scale and the relatively weak human, material, and financial resources, it was impossible to fully develop various productions. After the commune, according to the characteristics of each management district, the human, material, and financial resources were uniformly arranged. On the premise of ensuring increased grain production, specialized production teams were established for pig raising, cattle raising, sheep raising, beekeeping, fish farming, ginseng cultivation, fruit trees, medicinal materials, and transportation, so that the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has been rapidly and comprehensively developed. In 1959, in the case of severe spring drought, the 6,359 hectares of grain crops in the entire commune still achieved high yields; the total income of diversified operations increased sharply from 190,000 yuan in 1958 to 1,510,000 yuan, an increase of seven times.

                  Rational Layout
    In order to make full use of the superior conditions of the People's Communes and rapidly and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, we have mobilized the broad masses of the people throughout the province, adopted the method of combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, that is, combining leadership and the masses, and continuously carried out overall planning for agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries production, so that the layout of various industries has become increasingly rational.
    We understand that plant cultivation and animal husbandry are inseparable wholes; as long as the layout is rational, they can promote each other and complement each other. From the perspective of the relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry, agriculture and animal husbandry are equally important. Animal manure is the food of plants, plants are the food of livestock, and livestock is the food of humans. People only use part of the crops, and the other part (straw or by-products) is mainly livestock feed, and livestock manure returns to the land to grow crops. This is the principle of the internal connection, mutual condition, and mutual promotion of various industries within agriculture, and this is also an objective law. The broad masses of farmers in our country have long discovered the internal connection of these things, so they link "good harvest of grains and prosperity of livestock" together.
      We recognize the regularity of this internal connection between various industries, so we have determined that in addition to ensuring that grain production in mountain forest areas, grassland areas, and urban suburbs have surpluses in good years and self-sufficiency in poor years, and focus on forestry, animal husbandry, vegetables, and non-staple foods respectively, and vigorously develop diversified operations, other regions focus on grain and soybean production, and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At the same time, according to the characteristics of various places, establish commodity and diversified operation bases: mountain and semi-mountain areas are forestry and special product (ginseng, deer antler, medicinal materials, precious fur skins, wild fruits, mushrooms, agaric, etc.) production bases; grassland areas are livestock product bases; plain areas are commodity grain, soybean, pig, poultry production bases; People's Communes near rivers and basins are aquatic product bases. We not only grasp large-scale batch production, but also grasp small-scale sporadic production; we not only grasp domesticated production, but also grasp wild production. In places with relatively poor natural resources, we also require actively creating conditions, cultivating resources, and opening up production channels. Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and making full use of resources, we must not only rely on the mountains to eat the mountains, rely on the water to eat the water, and do whatever is produced, but also actively cultivate and maintain mountain and water resources. The People's Communes in mountainous areas have implemented the policy of combining collection and aquaculture; the People's Communes in semi-mountainous areas, grassland areas, and plain areas have implemented the policy of focusing on aquaculture and supplementing with collection. All parts of the province have regarded raising wild animals as a production item, and listed it as one of the eleven-raising movements for developing animal husbandry with pig raising as the first priority, including raising horses, cattle, sheep, mules, donkeys, chickens, ducks, rabbits, geese, and wild animals (deer, musk deer, sable, etc.). In addition, they have also actively developed sericulture and beekeeping, and also carried out artificial cultivation of precious medicinal materials such as ginseng, fritillary, schisandra, and gastrodia. The area of ginseng cultivation in the province increased by 249 times in 1959 compared to 1949.
      Rational arrangement of labor force is also an important aspect of overall planning and rational layout. Jilin Province has a variety of diversified operation projects, including perennial production and seasonal production. Moreover, seasonal production and agricultural production have a contradiction of competing for labor force. In particular, the rural labor force in Jilin Province is relatively tight; if the arrangement is improper, on the one hand, it may affect agricultural production, and on the other hand, it may cause seasonal diversified operation projects to miss the opportunity, and goods may be abandoned on the ground, causing losses. Therefore, in the favorable seasons for diversified operations, the People's Communes in various places, based on the principle of small-scale operations during busy farming seasons, large-scale operations during slack farming seasons, and seasonal blitzkriegs, organize large numbers of laborers in a timely manner to carry out short-term blitzkrieg collections; the specialized teams (groups) engaged in diversified operations must spare manpower to vigorously support agricultural production during busy farming seasons.
    In the arrangement and use of labor force, various places have made reasonable arrangements based on the principle of ensuring key points and taking into account various labor needs in rural areas, ensuring that the labor force used for agricultural and animal husbandry production during busy farming seasons reaches more than 80%. For example, in the current summer hoeing campaign, the labor force used for agricultural and animal husbandry production has reached 83.2%. In many areas and counties, the labor force put into the first line of summer hoeing has reached about 40% of the total population. In order to solve the shortage of labor force, a tool reform movement is also carried out. In this way, it is possible to widely develop diversified operations on the premise of ensuring grain production.
    Correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual
      Correctly handling the relationship between the state and the collective, the large collective and the small collective, and the collective and the individual is the key to vigorously developing diversified operations. First of all, according to the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, appropriately divide the scope of operations and implement decentralized management. The commune mainly operates large-scale diversified operation projects with complex technology and large investments, such as ginseng, medicinal material gardens, forest farms, pastures, deer farms, fishing farms, and demonstration and breeding farms; the management district (basic accounting unit) mainly operates medium and small-scale production projects that are not convenient for production teams to operate, such as forest farms, nurseries, orchards, aquaculture, and animal husbandry; in addition to vigorously raising pigs and poultry, the production team mainly operates seasonal large-scale sideline production, such as collecting mountain products, hunting, weaving, mowing grass, chopping firewood, etc.; commune members' families, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the workdays that should be borne for collective production, can raise a certain number of pigs, chickens, rabbits, and engage in small-scale sideline occupations such as collecting wild plants and weaving.
    Secondly, doing a good job in distribution and accumulation is also an important task to solve the relationship between the collective and the individual, the large collective and the small collective. Based on the principle of distribution according to work, wages are adopted by means of collective contracting, individual piecework, and over-quota bonuses. For those production projects that are difficult to adopt quotas, the methods of fixed quality, quantity, output value, fixed work points, and flexible evaluation are adopted to encourage the broad masses of commune members to engage in diversified operations.
    The diversified operations of communes, management districts, and production teams (excluding grain and individual products) are distributed according to the principle of three-level ownership and equivalent exchange. In order to expand reproduction and increase public accumulation, the income from large-scale sideline occupations operated by the production team is subject to public accumulation to the management district according to regulations, except for the part belonging to the management district. For diversified operation projects invested by communes and management districts, profits are shared proportionally. The share of the commune is used as public accumulation, and the share of the management district is included in the total income of the year for unified distribution and accumulation. Of the income from diversified operations owned by the production team, about 10% is retained for accumulation and used to expand production and capital construction; about 90% is used as the distribution part, of which a part is used for collective welfare such as oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables in the production team's canteen, and the rest is distributed among the commune members according to workdays. The commune also draws a certain proportion of the public accumulation fund to vigorously support poor management districts in developing diversified operations.
    In the process of comprehensive management and all-round development of agriculture, the commune helps management districts, especially the poorer management districts, to comprehensively develop production through partial commune-owned economy and other means, reflecting the close relationship between the large collective and the small collective. At present, although the proportion of partial commune-owned economy is not large, its role in the commune helping management districts develop production is not small. For example, the Shuguang, Sidaojiang, and Ermi People's Communes in the Tonghua area manufactured 227 carts and produced more than 600,000 jin of local chemical fertilizers for various management districts through commune-run enterprises in 1959, and also manufactured a large number of agricultural tools, which increased the means of production and saved a lot of labor force for various management districts. In particular, it has helped those relatively poor management districts to quickly change their poor appearance on the basis of self-reliance and hard work. Now, 17.5% of the poor management districts in the province have caught up with and surpassed the rich management districts with the help of the commune economy; 36.2% of the poor management districts have risen to become general management districts, making the economy between management districts gradually balanced, the relationship between them closer, and jointly embarking on the road of prosperity and prosperity.
    Again, promote the development of diversified operations and ensure the completion of the state's purchase plan through the production and sales contract system. This is also an important experience. The production and sales contracts between communes, management districts, production teams, and commercial departments are signed at one time and realized in stages, or signed in stages, depending on the circumstances, so as to achieve production and sales meetings and implementation of plans. The production and sales contracts should be signed in accordance with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, leaving room for maneuver, inspiring enthusiasm, and striving for advancement, so as to prevent the purchase plan from being too high or too low. In order to solve the shortage of production funds for communes, management districts, and production teams, commercial departments pay a certain amount of advance purchase money according to the purchase contract.

              Launch a Mass Movement
    In the past two years, we have adopted the method of launching a mass movement to promote the comprehensive management and all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries.
    In rural areas, we have launched an agricultural socialist labor competition movement with "three exceeding, two catching up, and one improvement" as the main contents. "Three exceeding" are: exceeding the contracted production of grain and soybeans, exceeding the planned output value of diversified operations, and exceeding the targets of animal husbandry production. "Two catching up" are: the poor catching up with the rich, and the backward catching up with the advanced. "One improvement" is: doing everything possible to improve labor management, vigorously reforming tools, improving labor efficiency, and widely carrying out competition activities. We have launched the "five good cadres" and "five good commune members" movement among cadres and commune members. In the competition, we adhere to large-scale inspections and evaluations, widely establish models, summarize experiences, and promote the in-depth development of the movement.
    All parts of the province have organized and led the mass movement of cities supporting rural areas and industry supporting agriculture. At present, 680 factories and mines in the province have been linked with counties and People's Communes. Many factories have put forward the slogan of "Under possible conditions, we will support whatever agriculture needs, and we will support whenever the countryside needs." The farmers excitedly said: "Fish help water, water help fish, fish and water are inseparable." The support of cities and industry has implemented the policy of basing on agriculture and has greatly strengthened the material strength of the People's Communes in the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries. At the same time, it has also promoted the in-depth development of the mechanization and semi-mechanization agricultural technology transformation movement centered on tool reform in rural areas, and has correspondingly increased mechanical equipment. This will further solve the contradiction between the comprehensive management and all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries and the shortage of labor force.
    In the large-scale mass movement, in order to implement the principle of combining leadership with the masses advocated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, cadres at all levels went deep into the masses, went deep into reality, and went to the front line of production to participate in production and lead production, so that the production movement was carried out vigorously and solidly, and promoted the movement to move forward continuously. During the spring plowing period, we organized 120,000 cadres to conduct a large-scale battle in the fields, which powerfully promoted spring plowing production. During the summer hoeing period, we organized another large-scale battle in the fields with the participation of more than 200,000 cadres, and carried out effective struggles against seedling blight, insect pests, and water damage in the continuous drizzling rain. Now, the field battle has become a system and has played a huge role in changing the thinking and work style of cadres.
    In the two field battles of spring plowing and summer hoeing, cadres at all levels went deep into the front line, shared food, lived, worked, and discussed with the broad masses of the people. In many places, field office work, meetings, studies, and evaluations were implemented, cadres took the lead in labor, participated in production, and led production. The more they did, the more solid they became, the greater their enthusiasm, and the more methods they had. Because they earnestly did a good job in experimental fields, grasped backward areas, grasped weak links, discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner, discovered new things and supported new things, and took one step and looked at the next step, the work style of cadres was changed. For example, cadres participating in production and leading production has become common, in-depth practical investigation and research has become regular, cadres' mass viewpoint has been strengthened, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people has become higher and higher, and the production wave has risen one wave higher than another, and a lively and vigorous scene has emerged. In order to maintain and carry forward this ideological style, the "three-seven system" leadership method has also been promoted in Party organizations below the county level throughout the province.
    After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, a mass movement to strive for the early realization of the program was launched in the rural areas of the province. With the development of this movement, various industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries will surely have greater development and prosperity. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, let us more resolutely implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, implement the policy of basing on agriculture, give full play to the superiority of the People's Communes on the agricultural production front, launch mass movements, vigorously carry out farmland capital construction, vigorously carry out tool reform, comprehensively implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, earnestly summarize local experience, humbly learn from foreign experience, and rapidly promote the diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries to a higher stage of development.

    论农业的以粮为纲全面发展
　　中共吉林省委书记处书记　李砥平
        以粮为纲全面发展的新阶段
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着人民公社的巩固与发展，吉林省农业战线已进入以粮为纲农林牧副渔全面发展的新阶段。目前，应认真总结这一新阶段的经验，以便进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，促使农林牧副渔更好地全面跃进。
    两年来吉林省的农业生产和全国各地一样，获得了连续的大跃进。1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上，战胜了严重的春旱和各种自然灾害，又获得了更全面的跃进。比起大跃进的1958年，1959年全省农业总产值增长17.2％，粮食、大豆总产量增长7.6％，其中大豆（绝大部分是商品粮）总产量增长21.2％。
    在以粮为纲的前提下，农、林、牧、副、渔五业都取得了巨大的成就。1959年造林面积相当于第一个五年计划期间造林面积总和的一点四倍，猪比1958年增长了24.7％，其它大小家畜也比1958年有很大的增长，副业生产总值比1958年增加了一点七倍。渔业总产量比1958年增长了17％。第二个五年计划的主要指标，提前三年基本实现了。
    农林牧副渔的全面发展，大大增加了粮食产量，保证了市场供应，增加了社员收入，支援了国家建设。全省商品粮1959年比1958年增长7.9％，粮食商品率达到40.8％。1959年农副土特产品收购总额（不包括粮食、大豆、油料）比1958年增长了69.7％。农产品商品量的增长，首先为工业提供了大量原料，1959年全省以农产品为原料的工业总产值，比1958年增长30％以上。其次，保证了市场供应，增加了城市和工矿区的副食品供应量，如蔬菜供应量1959年比1958年增加一至二倍。这些事实，雄辩地证明了党中央和毛主席指出的，发展国民经济要以农业为基础的方针的完全正确。
    两年来连续跃进的实践表明，吉林省农业生产战线已经出现了以粮为纲、全面发展的新阶段。首先是全省农村，经过两条道路的斗争和广泛深入地进行社会主义建设总路线的教育运动以后，广大农民的政治觉悟大大提高，对社会主义集体经济的优越性更加信赖，对农业的以粮为纲、全面发展的新形势，有了更加明确的认识，从而克服了小农经济单一经营和重农轻牧或重牧轻农等错误思想，为农业的全面发展奠定了思想基础。其次，两年来农业的大跃进和农村人民公社的发展和巩固，更为农业以粮为纲、全面发展，提供了有力的组织保证和充分的物质基础。人民公社是政治、经济、军事、文化统一的组织，它既便于加强农林牧副渔各业生产的统一领导，又便于全面规划，合理利用资源，大兴山水草木之利。特别是人民公社有了部分的公社所有制，和公共积累的不断增加，各项基本建设的逐步扩大，又为以粮为纲、全面发展创造了有利条件。同时，公社不仅是集体生产的组织者，又是集体生活的组织者，实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，大办公共食堂等集体福利事业，解放了大批妇女劳动力，提高了全体社员的劳动积极性和社会主义觉悟，便于统一安排劳动力，分工分业，既能发展农业生产，又能大搞多种经济，从而做到了人尽其才，地尽其利，物尽其用。
    两年来，我们在农业的以粮为纲、全面发展方面，取得了如下几点经验。
                  思想先行
    必须充分认识：我国发展国民经济的根本方针是以农业为基础，在优先发展重工业的前提下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。这是党中央和毛泽东同志所制定的一条正确解决重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系问题的根本方针，也是一条经过实践考验证明在我国实现社会主义工业化的完全正确的道路。这是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的重大发展。只有大力发展农业，才能迅速发展工业以逐步满足人民生活的需要；才能扩大工业原料的供应，扩大工业产品（包括重工业产品在内）的市场和资金积累的来源；才能使工业更好地支援农业，实现农业的技术改造，腾出更多的劳动力支援工业的发展。因此，那种认为迅速发展农业是同优先发展重工业的方针不相容的观念，是完全错误的。迅速发展农业，不但不会妨碍，相反地会大大促进重工业的发展。它们是互为条件，互相促进，相辅相成的。
    吉林省依照中央方针，根据本省特点确定农业以粮豆为纲，以林牧为特点，大力发展多种经营，促进农、林、牧、副、渔的全面跃进。
    为了贯彻执行上述方针，我们曾不断地批判在发展多种经营方面的各种错误思想，展开两条路线、两种方法的斗争，从根本上保证了一系列的胜利。
    关于以粮豆为纲和多种经营全面发展的关系，我们认为必须首先实行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，保证粮豆生产计划的完成，提高农村人口平均每人占有粮食量和商品大豆的产量。在这个前提下，认真贯彻执行种植业和饲养业并重，自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针；在发展种植业的同时，以养猪为首，全面地大量地发展畜牧业，积极开展多种经营，增加社员收入，增加公社的公共积累，保证市场需要，支援国家建设。以上两者，既不能轻重倒置也不能偏废。
    曾经有人认为：“大力发展多种经营，不必以粮豆为纲，什么来钱快搞什么，农民愿意搞啥就搞啥。”这是一种富裕中农的经营思想的反映，也是残留的个体经济思想的反映，是违反社会主义经济有计划按比例发展规律的。粮食是各业的基础，是关系到全体人民吃饭的大问题。事实证明，不发展粮食生产，是不可能搞好多种经营的。例如：敦化县大山嘴子人民公社，本来是个富饶美丽的山区，不但有肥沃的良田，而且山产丰富，境内有盛产鱼类和菱角的塔拉湖和牡丹湖。尽管这里自然条件如此优越，但是，在小农经济时期，人们只顾捕鱼，忽视粮食生产，所以粮食产量很低，有些人从湖里捞出菱角来充饥，吃的牙床发青，嘴唇发黑，所以外地人管他们叫“黑嘴巴”。合作化以来，这种情况已逐渐改变了；但头几年多种经营仍未得到充分发展。公社化前，这里的五百八十户人家，平均每年要由国家供应粮食三十多万斤。公社成立以后，他们根据山区“保证粮食自给有余，大力发展多种经营”的生产方针，进行了统筹规划，全面安排，使粮食产量迅速增加，其他各业生产也相应地发展起来。1959年农业生产获得了空前的大丰收，他们不仅口粮达到了自给自足，而且还卖给国家余粮近七十万斤之多。社员们高兴地说：“黑嘴巴”变成了“白嘴巴”。同时，他们还修成了长达二千一百米的两道大箔，完全控制了鱼群，一年四季随心如意地打鱼，使穷山沟变成了鱼米乡。
    也曾经有人认为：“在一个地区内只能单一经营，多种经营会造成相互矛盾。”这种思想是由于对农业生产的新形势认识不足，实质上是小农经济的单一经营的思想反映。这些人既没看见人民公社给综合经营、全面发展所提供的优越条件，也不懂得这种发展的必然趋势。他们习惯于用形而上学的观点去观察问题，所以不能理解农村各业之间的内在联系，如果不澄清这种思想，就不能很好地贯彻执行党的方针政策，势必产生重农轻牧甚至弃农就牧、就副的偏向。
    毛泽东同志早在1934年所写的《我们的经济政策》一文中谈到农业生产时就说过：“它不但需要解决最重要的粮食问题，而且需要解决衣服、砂糖、纸张等项日常用品的原料即棉、麻、蔗、竹等的供给问题。森林的培养，畜产的增殖，也是农业的重要部分。”我们必须根据毛泽东同志的指示，全面安排农业生产的布局，使农业生产的各项事业相互促进，全面发展。应当指出，农业的以粮为纲和全面发展，是由城乡人民对粮食和对副食品的需要，以及轻工业对原料的需要决定的。从吉林省的实际情况来看，由于重工业、森林工业、地方工业生产的大发展，交通和基本建设队伍的不断扩大，农村大量劳动力进入城市和工矿区，城市就业人员的迅速增加，这些都要求农业供应更多的粮食和多种农产品；而且农村人民群众随着生活水平的不断提高，对农产品的要求也越来越多。吉林省轻工业原料有60％以上是来自农产品的。以粮豆为纲，发展多种经营，为轻工业提供充足的原料，轻工业就会生产出物美价廉、丰富多采的产品来，以保证城市人民日益增长的需要。吉林省的农业生产，不仅要满足本省城乡人民的需要，而且还担负着支援全国和出口的光荣任务。因此，农业的以粮为纲和全面发展，已成必然趋势。
    许多事实证明：以粮豆为纲，综合经营、全面发展，不但不会互相抵触，而且可以互相促进。例如：海龙县曙光人民公社有二十二个管理区，在公社化前由于组织规模小，人力、物力、资金等都比较薄弱，无法全面发展各项生产。公社化后，根据各管理区的特点，统一安排了人力、物力和财力，在保证粮食增产的前提下，成立了养猪、养牛、养羊、养蜂、养鱼、栽培人参、果树、药材和运输等专业生产队，使农林牧副渔生产得到了迅速的全面的发展。1959年，在严重春旱的情况下，全公社的六千三百五十九公顷粮食作物，仍然获得了高额产量；多种经营的总收入，则由1958年的十九万元，猛增到一百五十一万元，提高了七倍。
                  合理布局
    为了充分利用人民公社的优越条件，迅速地全面地发展农林牧副渔各业，我们在全省范围内，发动了广大人民群众，采取了自下而上和自上而下、即领导与群众相结合的方法，不断地对农林牧副渔生产进行了全面规划，使各业的布局日益合理。
    我们懂得，植物的种植和动物的饲养是不可分离的整体；只要布局合理，它们之间是能够相互促进、相辅相成的。从农
  业和牧业的关系来看，农业和牧业是同等重要的。牲畜的粪便，
  是植物的粮食，植物是牲畜的粮食，牲畜是人类的食物。人
  们利用农作物也不过是一部分，另一部分（秸秆或副产物）主
  要是牲畜的饲料，牲畜粪便还给土地长庄稼。这就是农业内部
  各业相互联系、互为条件、互相促进的道理，这也是客观规律。
  我国广大农民群众很久以来，就已经发现了这些事物的内部联
  系，所以把“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺”联在一起。
      我们认识到这种各业之间内在联系的规律性，所以我们确
  定除了山林区、草原区、城市郊区的粮食生产要做到丰年有
  余、欠年自给，并分别以林、牧、蔬菜、副食品为主，大力发展多
  种经营外，至于其他地区则以粮食、大豆生产为主，全面发展农
  林牧副渔。同时根据各地的特点，建立商品和多种经营基地：
  山区和半山区为林业和特产品（人参、鹿茸、药材、珍贵皮
  张、野生果实、蘑菇、木耳等）生产基地；草原区为畜牧产品基
  地；平原区为商品粮、大豆、生猪、家禽生产基地；靠江河流域
  的人民公社为水产基地。既抓大宗的成批的生产，又抓小宗的
  零星的生产；既抓家生的，又抓野生的。在自然资源较差的地方，也要求积极创造条件，培养资源，开辟生产门路。本着因
  地制宜、充分利用资源的原则，既要靠山吃山，靠水吃水，出
  什么搞什么，又要积极培育和养护山、水资源。山区人民公社贯彻执行了采捕与养殖相结合的方针；半山区、草原区、平原
  区的人民公社贯彻执行了以养殖为主、采捕为辅的方针。全省各地都把饲养野生动物作为一项生产，并且列为发展畜牧业以
  养猪为首的养马、养牛、养羊、养骡、养驴、养鸡、养鸭、养
  兔、养鹅、养野生动物（鹿、麝、貂等）的十一养运动的一项
  内容。此外，还积极发展了养蚕、养蜂，对人参、贝母、五味
  子、天麻等珍贵药材也实行了人工栽培。全省人参栽培面积，
  1959年比1949年增加了二百四十九倍。
      合理安排劳动力，也是全面规划、合理布局的一个重要方
  面。吉林省多种经营项目繁多，既有常年性生产，又有季节性
  生产。而且季节性生产和农业生产又有着争劳动力的矛盾，特别是吉林省农村劳动力较为紧张；如果安排不当，一方面可能影响农业生产，一方面则可能使季节性的多种经营项目错过时机，货弃于地，造成损失。因而，各地人民公社在大搞多种经营的有利季节里，本着农忙小搞、农闲大搞、季节突击的原则，适时地组织大批劳动力进行短期间的突击采集；从事多种经营的专业队（组），在农忙季节必须抽出力量大力支援农业生产。
    各地在劳动力安排使用上，根据保证重点，对农村各项用工统筹兼顾原则，做了合理安排，保证了农忙季节用于农牧业生产的劳动力达到80％以上。例如，在当前夏锄的运动中，使用于农牧业生产的劳动力达到了83.2％。不少地区不少县份投入夏锄第一线的劳动力，已达到占总人口的40％左右。为解决劳动力的不足，同时开展工具改革运动。这样，便能够在保证粮食生产的前提下，广泛地发展多种经营。
    正确处理国家、集体和个人的关系
      正确处理国家和集体、大集体和小集体、集体和个人的关系问题，是大力发展多种经营的关键。首先，根据统一领导、分级管理的原则，适当划分经营范围，实行分级管理。公社主要经营技术性复杂、投资多的大型多种经营项目，如人参、药材园、林场、牧场、鹿场、渔场和示范性、繁殖性的养殖场等；管理区（基本核算单位）主要经营不便于生产队经营的中、小型的生产项目，如林场、苗圃、果园、水产业和畜牧业等；生产队除了大力养猪、养家禽外，主要经营季节性的大宗副业生产，如采集山货、狩猎、编织、打草、打柴等；社员家庭，在保证完成对集体生产应该担负的出工数的原则下，可以饲养一定数量的猪、鸡、兔，搞些野生植物采集、编织等小型副业。
    其次，搞好分配和积累也是解决集体和个人、大集体和小集体关系的一项重要工作。我们本着按劳分配的原则，工资采取了集体承包、个人计件、超额奖励的办法，对那些难以采取定额的生产项目，采取定质、定量、定产值、固定工分、死分活评的办法，鼓励广大社员从事多种经营的积极性。
    公社、管理区、生产队的多种经营（不包括粮食和个别产品），根据三级所有制和等价交换的原则，进行分配。为了扩大再生产，增加公共积累，生产队集体经营的除属于管理区所有的部分外，凡是大宗副业的收入，要按规定向管理区缴纳公共积累。凡是由公社和管理区投资的多种经营项目按比例提成，公社提成部分做为公共积累，管理区提成部分列入当年总收入中进行统一分配和积累。生产队所有多种经营收入部分，其中10％左右留做积累，用于扩大生产和基本建设；90％左右做为分配部分，其中除一部分用于生产队食堂的油、盐、柴、菜之类的集体福利而外，其余按劳动日在社员个人中间进行分配。公社还抽出一定比例的公积金，大力扶助穷管理区发展多种经营。
    公社在农业的综合经营、全面发展的过程中，通过部分社有经济及其他办法，帮助管理区特别是较穷的管理区全面发展生产，体现了大集体和小集体之间的密切关系。目前，部分社有经济的比重虽然不大，但是，它在公社帮助管理区发展生产中的作用却是不小的。例如：通化地区曙光、四道江、二密等三个人民公社，1959年通过社办企业为各管理区制造了二百二十七辆大车，生产了六十多万斤土化肥，还制造了大量的农具，使各管理区增加了生产资料，节省了大量的劳动力。特别是帮助了那些较为贫困的管理区，使它们能够在自力更生发奋图强的基础上迅速地改变贫困面貌。现在全省已有17.5％的穷管理区在公社经济的帮助下，赶上和超过了富裕管理区；有36.2％的穷管理区上升为一般管理区，使管理区与管理区之间的经济渐趋平衡，相互关系更加密切，共同走上富裕繁荣的道路。
    再次，通过产销合同制度，推动多种经营的发展，保证国家收购计划的完成。这也是一条重要的经验。公社、管理区、生产队同商业部门的产销合同，根据不同情况，有的是一次签订分期实现，也有分期签订的，做到产销见面，计划落实。产销合同要根据实事求是、留有余地、鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神来签订，防止收购计划偏高或偏低。为了解决公社、管理区、生产队生产资金的不足，商业部门按收购合同付给一定数量的预购金。
              大搞群众运动
    两年来，我们采取了大搞群众运动的方法，推动了农林牧副渔综合经营、全面发展。
    在农村，开展以“三超、两赶、一提高”为主要内容的农业社会主义劳动竞赛运动。“三超”是：粮豆超包产，多种经营超计划产值，畜牧业生产超指标。“两赶”是：穷赶富，后进赶先进。“一提高”是：千方百计改善劳动管理，大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率，广泛开展竞赛运动。在干部和社员中开展了“五好干部”和“五好社员”运动。在竞赛中坚持大检查、大评比，广树标兵，总结经验，推动运动深入开展。
    全省各地有组织、有领导地开展了城市支援农村、工业支援农业的群众运动。目前，全省已经有六百八十个工厂、矿山同县和人民公社挂上了钩。很多工厂提出“在可能的条件下，农业需要什么，我们支援什么，农村什么时候需要，我们什么时候支援”的口号。农民兴奋地说：“鱼帮水，水帮鱼，鱼水不分。”城市和工业的支援，贯彻执行了以农业为基础的方针，大大壮大了人民公社农林牧副渔全面发展的物质力量。同时，也推动了农村以工具改革为中心的机械化、半机械化农业技术改造运动的深入开展，相应地增加了机械设备。这将进一步地解决农林牧副渔综合经营、全面发展与劳动力不足的矛盾。
    在大搞群众运动中，为了贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志所倡导的领导与群众相结合的原则，各级干部深入群众，深入实际，到生产第一线去参加生产、领导生产，使生产运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实，推动运动不断地向前发展。在春耕期间，我们组织了十二万干部，进行田间大会战，有力地推动了春耕生产。在夏锄期间，又组织了二十多万干部参加的田间大会战，对霪雨连绵中的苗荒、虫害、水害等进行了有效的斗争。现在，田间大会战已经形成制度，并在改变干部思想作风方面发挥了巨大作用。
    在春耕、夏锄两次田间大会战中，各级干部深入前线，同广大人民群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。有不少的地方实行了田间办公、开会、学习和评比，干部带头劳动，参加生产领导生产。越干越踏实，越干劲头越大，越干办法越多。由于切实做到了大搞试验田，抓后进地区、抓薄弱环节，发现问题及时解决，发现新事物、扶植新事物，走上步看下步，改变了干部作风。例如：干部参加生产领导生产普遍了，深入实际调查研究经常了，干部的群众观点加强了，干群关系更加密切了。因而广大群众的生产积极性越来越高，生产浪潮一浪高过一浪，出现了生气勃勃的景象。为了保持与发扬这种思想作风，全省在县以下的党组织中，还推行了“三七制”领导方法。
    全国农业发展纲要公布以后，全省农村中掀起了一个争取提前实现纲要的群众运动。随着这一运动的开展，农林牧副渔各业一定会有更大的发展与繁荣。让我们在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，更加坚决地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，在农业生产战线上充分发挥人民公社的优越性，大搞群众运动，大搞农田基本建设，大搞工具改革，全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法，认真总结本地经验，虚心学习外地经验，迅速地把农林牧副渔的多种经营推向一个更高的发展阶段。
