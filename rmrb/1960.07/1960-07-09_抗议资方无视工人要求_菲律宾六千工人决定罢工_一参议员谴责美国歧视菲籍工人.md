Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, Manila Dispatch: According to Manila newspapers, over six thousand workers from enterprises such as the Philippine National Shipbuilding and Steel Corporation recently submitted a strike notice to the Labor Relations Bureau, protesting the capitalists' disregard of the workers' just economic demands and discriminatory actions against union members.

The companies whose workers have announced their intention to strike include the National Shipbuilding and Steel Corporation (2,000 workers), the Central Manufacturing Corporation (1,000 workers), the Manila Railway Company (3,000 workers), and the Philippine Radio Communications Company (280 workers).

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th, Manila Dispatch: According to the June 30th issue of the "Philippine Herald," Philippine Senator Roseller Lim recently condemned the U.S. government for discriminating against Filipino workers employed at U.S. military bases in Guam, the Mariana Islands, and Okinawa.

He charged that the U.S. refuses to pay Filipino workers even the minimum wage, and American workers doing the same work are paid several times more.

Earlier, Senator Rogelio de la Rosa condemned the U.S. government for discriminatory and unreasonable segregation, poor working conditions, and delayed wage payments for Filipino workers at U.S. military bases in Guam, Wake Island, and Okinawa.

    据新华社6日讯　马尼拉消息：据6月30日的“菲律宾先驱报”报道，菲律宾参议员罗塞列尔·林最近谴责美国政府歧视在关岛，马里亚纳群岛和冲绳岛的美国军事基地上工作的菲律宾工人。
