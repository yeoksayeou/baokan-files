Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th - Guaranteeing high-quality pig iron to refine good steel and manufacture good machinery is the common slogan followed by all employees of Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant in Henan. From January this year to the present, the qualified rate of pig iron they produce has remained above 99%, and they have overfulfilled the state production plan every month and every quarter, becoming a red flag for high quality and high output on the steel front in Henan Province.

The high-quality and high-yield achievements of Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant are the result of the plant's Party committee mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions. In order to ensure the quality of pig iron, the plant's Party committee led all employees in carrying out a mass movement of "setting up checkpoints at every level, desulfurizing everywhere, and everyone being responsible." They adopted measures such as increasing air volume and raising air temperature, which greatly increased smelting intensity; increased in-furnace desulfurization, improved pre-furnace operations, and vigorously grasped two rounds of ore roasting, removing 40% of the sulfur content from the ore before it entered the furnace; strengthened coal washing and coking, sifting and washing raw coal, and rationally allocating coal, loading hot and smelting quickly, so that the sulfur content of coke was controlled below 0.7%. As a result of the above measures, the sulfur content of the pig iron produced by the plant this year has been very low, thus ensuring the improvement of pig iron quality.

In order to continuously improve the quality of pig iron, the employees of Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant have always attached importance to raw material management, strictly controlled the accuracy of ore and coke, and achieved coarse grain eaten finely and smooth furnace charge. They also strengthened the chemical analysis work, so that ore, coke, pig iron, and slag were analyzed in a timely manner; quality analysis meetings were established in workshops, teams, and furnaces, and each furnace and shift had quality inspectors; the plant and workshops established quality inspection committees, so that full-time inspection personnel and mass participation in management were closely combined. In addition, the Party and government leading cadres of this plant have always gone deep into the front line of production, working and holding meetings in front of the furnace, discovering problems and solving problems in a timely manner together with the workers, which has played a great role in improving the quality of pig iron.

    河南新乡第二钢铁厂
    群策群力消灭硫害
    新华社郑州28日电　以优质生铁保证炼好钢制造好机器，是河南新乡第二钢铁厂全体职工共同遵循的行动口号。从今年元月到目前为止，他们所产的生铁合格率一直保持在99％以上，而且月月季季都超额完成了国家生产计划，成为河南省钢铁战线上优质高产的一面红旗。
    新乡市第二钢铁厂的优质高产成绩，是厂党委发动职工群众出谋献策的结果。厂党委为了保证生铁质量，领导全厂职工开展了一个“关关设卡，处处脱硫，人人有责”的群众运动。他们采取加大风量，提高风温，大大提高了冶炼强度；加大炉内脱硫，改进炉前操作，狠抓矿石两次焙烧，使矿石入炉前除掉硫分40％；加强洗煤炼焦，把原煤过筛洗净，合理配煤，热装快炼，作到了焦炭含硫控制在0.7％以下。采取以上措施的结果，全厂今年以来所产的生铁，含硫一直很低，从而保证了生铁质量的提高。
    新乡市第二钢铁厂职工为了不断提高生铁质量，一贯重视原料管理，严格控制矿石、焦炭精度，作到了粗粮细吃，炉料顺行。他们还加强了化验工作，作到矿石、焦炭、生铁、炉渣及时化验；车间、班、炉建立了质量分析会，每炉每班设有质量检查员；厂、车间成立了质量检查委员会，使专职检查人员同群众参加管理密切结合起来。此外，这个厂的党政领导干部，始终深入生产第一线，办公、开会都在炉前，同工人一起及时发现问题，及时解决问题，对提高生铁质量起了很大的作用。
