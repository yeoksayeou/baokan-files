    "Ten Personnel" Go to the Countryside

    During the busy days of summer production, the finance and trade departments of Tianchang County, Anhui Province, launched the "Ten Personnel" going to the countryside movement. Purchasing agents from commercial departments went to the fields and villages to carry out purchases; salespersons went to the countryside to sell goods; technicians went to the countryside to teach the use of new tools, pesticides, and fertilizers. Grain department clerks went to the countryside to inspect grain quality and assess grain prices at the threshing grounds; warehouse keepers went to the countryside to impart grain storage knowledge; processing personnel went to the countryside to promote advanced processing tools and methods. Accounting personnel from finance and banking units went to the countryside to help communes and production teams rectify financial work-point accounts; agricultural loan officers went to the communes to issue and recover agricultural loans; savings personnel went deep into the production teams to handle deposit and withdrawal business; tax personnel went to the countryside with invoices, participating in production while carrying out tax work. Currently, over two thousand finance and trade workers in the county are touring villages, fields, and threshing grounds every day, powerfully promoting summer production.

    The department store is moved to the field,
    Though small, it has all the vital organs.

    “十员”下乡
    在夏季生产繁忙的日子里，安徽天长县财贸部门开展了“十员”下乡运动，商业部门的收购员到田间、村庄开展收购；售货员下乡售货；技术员下乡传授新式工具和农药、化肥的使用技术。粮食部门的营业员下乡，到场地检验粮质、评定粮价；保管人员下乡传授粮食保管知识；加工人员下乡推广先进加工工具和使用方法。财政金融单位的会计人员下乡帮助公社、生产队整顿财务工分账目；农贷员到公社发放和收回农贷；储蓄人员深入各生产队办理存、付业务；税收人员带票据下乡，边参加生产、边搞税收工作。现在，全县每天有两千多财贸职工巡回到村庄、田头、场地，有力地推动了夏季生产。
