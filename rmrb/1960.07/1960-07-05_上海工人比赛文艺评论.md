Literary Trends

    On the basis of activities such as poetry competitions, painting competitions, and song competitions, Shanghai's mass amateur literary movement has begun to see a surge in mass amateur literary criticism activities. More than 200 amateur literary criticism groups have been established in the ten districts of Shanghai, with more than 3,000 participants. The criticism group of the Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory has published 25 literary criticism articles in newspapers and periodicals within a year.
    Yangpu District in Shanghai recently held a mass amateur literary "Three Criticism" (book review, play review, film review) competition, with more than 600 people from more than 200 factories, neighborhoods, and other units participating, including workers, engineers, and family members. Huang Baomei, a nationally renowned female cotton spinning worker, and Li Fuxiang, an advanced worker and boring worker, also read their articles at the competition. The content of the competition mainly consisted of reviewing four books, including "Ten Years of Shanghai's Liberation" and "One Day of Shanghai's Great Leap Forward," and the film "Battle of Shanghai" and the Shanghai opera "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky." Everyone talked about literature and art at the meeting, and the atmosphere was lively. The competition produced more than 2,500 literary criticism articles, from which dozens of excellent works were selected. Judging from these selected outstanding works, although most of the authors are worker masses who are new to writing literary criticism and have not been exposed to many literary works, they share a common characteristic: a clear class stand and political viewpoint. At the same time, they pay attention to artistic analysis of the works. The articles are relatively short and the language is vivid.
    Shanghai's "Liberation Daily," "Wenhui Daily," and "Mengya" and other newspapers and periodicals published news and commentaries on Yangpu District's mass literary criticism competition, believing that this competition is a new form of Shanghai's mass amateur literary activities and a new development in the mass literary movement.

    上海工人比赛文艺评论
    上海群众业余文艺运动在赛诗、赛画、赛歌等活动的基础上，又开始出现群众业余文艺评论活动的热潮。上海十个市区已有二百个以上的业余文艺评论小组，有三千多人参加。永大染织一厂的评论小组，一年内就在报刊发表了二十五篇文艺评论文章。
    上海市杨浦区最近举办了一次群众业余文艺《三评》（书评、剧评、影评）比赛会，就有二百多个工厂、里弄等单位的六百多人参加，有工人，有工程师，还有家属。全国著名的棉纺女工黄宝妹、先进工作者镗工李福祥也在比赛会上读了自己的文章。比赛的内容，主要是评论《上海解放十年》、《上海大跃进的一日》等四本书和电影《战上海》、沪剧《鸡毛飞上天》。会上大家谈文说艺，热气腾腾。比赛会上产生文艺评论文章二千五百多篇，其中选拔出优秀作品几十篇。从这些选拔出的部分优秀作品来看，虽然文章的作者大多是初学写文艺评论的工人群众，接触文艺作品并不多，但具有一个共同的特色：阶级立场和政治观点鲜明。同时注意对作品作艺术分析，文章都较短小，语言也生动。
    上海《解放日报》、《文汇报》、《萌芽》等报刊就杨浦区这次群众性文艺评论比赛活动，分别发表了消息和评论，认为这种比赛活动是上海群众业余文艺活动的一个新形式，是群众文艺运动的新发展。
