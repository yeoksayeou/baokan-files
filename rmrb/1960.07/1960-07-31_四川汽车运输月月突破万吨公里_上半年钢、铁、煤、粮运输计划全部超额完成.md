Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 30th: Sichuan Province's automotive transportation departments have consistently broken through 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton average monthly output for four consecutive months from March to June, creating a record of large-scale sustained high production in automotive transportation. As a result, the province's automotive transportation departments overfulfilled the transportation plans for major materials such as steel, iron, coal, and grain in the first half of the year.

During these months, the number of high-yield collectives and high-yield individual vehicles in the province's automotive transportation departments increased month by month. Currently, there are eleven transportation companies with an average monthly output of over 10,000 ton-kilometers, seventeen teams with an average monthly output of over 20,000 ton-kilometers, seventy-two groups with an output ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 ton-kilometers, and two hundred and thirty-eight individual vehicles with a monthly output ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 ton-kilometers. National advanced producer and Red Flag driver Chen Wantang and Xie Xuanqing have both created the province's highest record with a monthly output of over 230,000 ton-kilometers.

Achieving 10,000 ton-kilometers of transportation per ton of automotive capacity each month is one of the important measures taken by the Sichuan Province transportation departments to fully tap the potential of existing transportation tools and maintain high production through high-quality maintenance. The province's total freight volume is expected to increase by more than 70% this year compared to last year, and transportation capacity cannot keep up with the demand. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the province's transportation workers to carry out a high-production Red Flag competition, requiring railway locomotives to produce one million ton-kilometers per day, ships to produce 10,000 ton-kilometers per horsepower per month, automobiles to produce 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month, wooden boats to produce 1,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month, carts to produce 1,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month, loading and unloading one ton of goods in no more than one minute, and road construction with an average work efficiency of ten cubic meters per person per workday.

The Provincial Committee's call immediately turned into action among the province's automotive transportation workers. They carried out in-depth technical innovation and technical revolution movements, vigorously promoted truck-trailer transportation and trailer transportation, and promoted advanced experiences such as double-shift operations to achieve safe and high production. Currently, about 70% of the automobiles in the province have realized one car towing one or several trailers. The workers of the Chongqing Automotive Transportation Company, in order to overcome the difficulties of steep slopes and many bends on mountain roads, created devices such as overload alarms, flywheel automatic alarms, trailer decoupling automatic alarms, tire pressure loss automatic alarms, and trailer self-braking devices. In June, all vehicles in this company achieved one car with one trailer or one car with multiple trailers, creating a new record of 30,324 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton per month, ranking first in the province.

Striving to improve the efficiency of station handling and loading and unloading, eliminating the phenomenon of vehicles "running in the middle and idling at both ends," and accelerating vehicle turnover are important measures for Sichuan Province to achieve 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton per month. To date, more than half of the province's stations and port terminals have achieved loading and unloading using conveyors, cranes, winches, funnels, and high platforms, and handling using rails, carts, and chutes, which greatly improved loading and unloading efficiency and shortened loading and unloading time.

### 四川汽车运输月月突破万吨公里  上半年钢、铁、煤、粮运输计划全部超额完成

    四川汽车运输月月突破万吨公里
    上半年钢、铁、煤、粮运输计划全部超额完成
    据新华社成都30日电　从3月到6月的四个月内，四川省汽车运输部门车吨平均月产连续突破万吨公里，创造了汽车运输大面积持续高产的成绩。上半年，全省汽车运输部门因此超额完成了钢、铁、煤、粮等主要物资的运输计划。
    这几个月，全省汽车运输部门的高产集体和高产单车逐月增加。现在分别达到平均月产一万吨公里、两万吨公里、三万吨公里以上的有十一个运输公司，平均月产两万吨公里以上的车队十七个，两万到十万吨公里以上的小组七十二个，月产两万到十万吨公里以上的单车二百三十八辆。全国先进生产者、红旗驾驶员陈万堂、谢选清，都分别创造了月产二十三万吨公里以上的全省最高纪录。
    实现汽车每个吨位每月运输一万吨公里，是四川省交通运输部门充分挖掘现有运输工具的潜力，以高运保高产的重要措施之一。今年全省总货运量预计比去年增长70％以上，运力赶不上运量需要。因此今年一开始，中共四川省委就号召全省交通战线职工开展高产红旗竞赛，要求铁路一台机车日产一百万吨公里，轮船每马力月产一万吨公里，汽车车吨月产一万吨公里，木船船吨月产一千吨公里，架车车吨月产一千吨公里，装卸一吨货物不超过一分钟，筑路平均工效每人每个工作日十方。
    省委的号召，立即在全省汽车运输职工中变成了行动。他们深入开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞汽车列车运输和拖挂运输，推广双班作业等先进经验，做到安全高产。现在全省有70％左右的汽车，实现了一车拖带一个挂车或几个挂车。重庆市汽车运输公司的职工，为了战胜山区公路坡陡弯多的困难，创造了超载报警、飞轮自动报警、挂车脱钩自动报警、轮胎缺气自动报警、挂车自刹车等装置。6月份，这个公司的全部车辆都实现了一车一挂或一车多挂，创造了车吨月产三万零三百二十四吨公里的新纪录，在全省居第一位。
    千方百计提高车站搬运装卸效率，消灭车辆“跑在中间，窝在两头”的现象，加速车辆周转，是四川省实现汽车车吨月产万吨公里省的重要措施。到目前为止，全省已有半数以上的车站、港口码头，做到了装卸用输送机、起重机、卷扬机、漏斗和高站台，搬运用轨道、车子和梭槽，大大提高了装卸效率，缩短了装卸时间。
