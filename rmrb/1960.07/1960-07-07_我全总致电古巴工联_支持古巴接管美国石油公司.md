    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today sent a telegram to the Cuban Trade Union, expressing full support for the Cuban government's takeover of the American Texaco Oil Company.

    The telegram stated that after sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, American imperialism has intensified the creation of tension in the Far East and intensified its diplomatic and economic threats against the Cuban revolution. This has repeatedly exposed the aggressive and warlike nature of American imperialism. Your takeover of the oil company has seriously struck at the new interventionist conspiracies of American imperialism.

    Zhang Zhaomei, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Petroleum Trade Union, also sent a telegram to the Cuban National Federation of Petroleum Workers on the 1st, warmly congratulating the Cuban people on their new victory in the struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and smash the provocative actions of American imperialism to undermine the Cuban revolution.

    我全总致电古巴工联
    支持古巴接管美国石油公司
    新华社6日讯　中华全国总工会今天打电报给古巴工联，表示全力支持古巴政府接管美国德士古石油公司。
    电报说，美帝国主义在破坏四国首脑会议后，在远东加紧制造紧张局势，在外交上和经济上加紧威胁古巴革命，这都一再暴露美帝国主义的侵略和战争本性。你们接管石油公司，严重地打击了美帝国主义新的干涉阴谋。
    中国石油工会全国委员会主席张兆美也曾在1日致电古巴全国石油工人联合会，热烈祝贺古巴人民在维护国家主权、粉碎美帝国主义破坏古巴革命的挑衅行为的斗争中取得的这一新的胜利。
