Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Electric Dispatch: Tibetan farmers on the Tibetan plateau are actively preparing for the autumn harvest, welcoming the first year of abundant harvest after the democratic reform.

This year, the emancipated Tibetan farmers have universally organized agricultural production mutual aid teams, thus improving cultivation and field management. The whole region is showing a scene of abundant harvest, and the maturity period of crops is roughly the same. In order to achieve fast, careful, and good harvesting in this year's autumn harvest, ensure bumper harvests, and further improve labor efficiency to prepare for the great development of agricultural production next year, party committees at all levels are leading farmers to vigorously grasp the preparation of autumn harvest tools, and timely put forward the slogan of "getting labor from tools." The Shannan Sub-district Committee has listed the preparation of autumn harvest tools as one of the main tasks at present.

The preparation of autumn harvest tools in various places focuses on county farm tool factories, further organizing blacksmiths, carpenters, leather workers, and stonemasons to implement the principle of attaching equal importance to reform, manufacturing, and repair. In more than ten days, Mozhugongka County newly made and reformed more than 5,000 pieces of various autumn harvest agricultural tools, more than doubling the original autumn harvest tools. The Shannan area has made more than 30,000 pieces of autumn harvest tools and is still rushing to produce them day and night.

In the past, under the serf system in Tibet, autumn harvest tools, like other agricultural production tools, were very backward and small in number. According to a survey in Zhanang County, 12,000 agricultural tools are needed for this year's autumn harvest, but there are less than 5,000 existing. Farmers in many areas did not even have heavy sickles. They pulled crops by hand during harvesting, and used yaks to tread on the threshing ground. It took more than three months from the start of harvesting to the completion of threshing. In response to this situation, various places have reformed and created a variety of new autumn harvest tools, such as serrated sickles and winnowing machines, by combining local farmers' habits with advanced experience in the interior, which will greatly speed up the progress of this year's autumn harvest. Last year, using stone rollers for threshing was still limited to a few areas, but this year it has been widely promoted in various places. Quqshui District of Quxui County alone has prepared 600 stone rollers. Many agricultural production mutual aid teams have manufactured carts and handcarts to reduce heavy physical labor, and mutual aid teams with good conditions have also successfully trial-produced ear cutting machines and threshing machines. A wave of great reform, great manufacturing, and great repair of autumn harvest tools is gradually forming in the Tibetan countryside.

### 提高劳动效率　保证细收细打  西藏积极准备工具迎秋收

    提高劳动效率　保证细收细打
    西藏积极准备工具迎秋收
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏高原的藏族农民正在及早进行秋收准备工作，迎接民主改革后的第一个丰收年。
    今年，翻身后的藏族农民普遍地组织了农业生产互助组，因而改进了耕作和田间管理，全区各地呈现出了一片丰收景象，农作物的成熟期大体一致。为了在今年的秋收中做到收快、收细、收好，保证丰产丰收，并且进一步提高劳动效率，给明年的农业生产大发展作好准备，各级党委正领导农民大抓秋收工具的准备工作，及时提出了“向工具要劳动力”的口号。山南分工委把准备秋收工具列为当前的主要工作之一。
    各地秋收工具的准备工作以县农具厂为中心，进一步把铁、木、皮、石匠组织起来，实行改革、制造和修理并重的方针。墨竹工卡县在十多天时间内，就新制、改制了各种秋收农具五千多件，超过原有的秋收工具一倍多。山南专区已制成秋收工具三万多件，目前仍在日夜赶制中。
    过去在西藏农奴制度下，秋收工具和其他农业生产工具一样非常落后，而且数量也少。据札囊县调查，今年秋收中需要一万二千件农具，而现有的还不到五千件。许多地区的农户连笨重的镰刀也没有，收割时用手拔庄稼，打场用牦牛踩踏，从开始收割到打场完毕需要三个多月的时间。针对这种情况，各地在准备秋收工具中，根据当地农民习惯和内地先进经验相结合，改制和创造了多种新式的秋收工具，如锯齿镰、风车等。这将大大加快今年秋收的进度。去年采用石磙打场还是少数地区，今年各地已普遍推广，仅曲水县的曲水区就已准备了六百条石磙。不少的农业生产互助组，为减轻笨重体力劳动，制造了马车和手推车，条件好的互助组还试制成功切穗机、脱粒机。一个大改、大制、大修秋收工具的热潮，正在西藏农村逐渐形成。
