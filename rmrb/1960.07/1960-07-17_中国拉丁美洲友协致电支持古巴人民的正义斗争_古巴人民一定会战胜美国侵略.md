　　China-Latin America Friendship Association Sends a Message of Support for the Just Struggle of the Cuban People
    The Cuban People Will Surely Overcome American Aggression
    Xinhua News Agency, July 16th. The China-Latin America Friendship Association today sent a telegram to Baldomero Álvarez Ríos, President of the Cuba-China Friendship Association, supporting the just struggle of the Cuban people against interference and threats of aggression by U.S. imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence and sovereignty.
    The telegram stated that in order to restore its colonial rule in Cuba, U.S. imperialism, after exhausting all kinds of despicable means to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and sabotage the Cuban revolution and suffering a shameful defeat, is now brazenly employing economic blockades and actively plotting armed intervention in an attempt to strangle the Cuban revolution and re-enslave the Cuban people. This vicious plot has aroused the extraordinary indignation of the people of the world. We firmly believe that the Cuban people, who have stood up, will surely overcome any threat of aggression from U.S. imperialism.
    The telegram pointed out that the series of measures taken by the Cuban government to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, safeguard national sovereignty, and develop the national economy are completely correct and just. It is not only warmly supported by the Cuban people, but will also win the sympathy and support of the people of Latin America and the world.
    The telegram stated that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Cuban people, as well as all peace-loving people of the world. We, the Chinese people, feel incomparably indignant at U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan and its shameless interference in our internal affairs. Therefore, the Cuban people's anti-U.S. struggle is a great encouragement and support to us, the Chinese people. We regard the Cuban people's anti-U.S. struggle as our struggle, and the victory of the Cuban people's anti-U.S. struggle is also our victory. We firmly support the Cuban people and will always stand with the Cuban people to fight to the end against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference.

    电报说，美帝国主义为了恢复它在古巴的殖民统治，在用尽各种卑鄙手段干涉古巴内政和破坏古巴革命遭到可耻失败后，现在又悍然采用经济封锁和积极策划武装干涉，企图扼杀古巴革命和重新奴役古巴人民。这一恶毒阴谋，引起了全世界人民的异常愤慨。我们坚信，站起来了的古巴人民一定会战胜美帝国主义的任何侵略威胁。
    电报指出，古巴政府所采取的一系列坚决反对美帝国主义侵略、维护国家主权和发展民族经济的措施，是完全正确的和正义的。它不但为古巴人民热烈拥护，同时也将赢得拉丁美洲及全世界人民的同情和支持。
    电报说，美帝国主义是中国和古巴以及全世界爱好和平的人民的共同敌人。我们中国人民对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾、无耻干涉我国内政的行为，感到无比愤怒。因而古巴人民的反美斗争对我们中国人民来说，是一个极大的鼓舞和支持。我们把古巴人民的反美斗争看作也是我们的斗争，古巴人民反美斗争的胜利也就是我们的胜利。我们坚决支持古巴人民，并永远和古巴人民站在一起为反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉奋斗到底。
