Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch: Hangzhou Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory has implemented the policy of quality first and overall leap forward, achieving great results. The factory's silk fabrics, eight comparable products, have achieved a mixed first-class product rate of 100% for seven consecutive months. Due to the rapid and continuous improvement of product quality, the factory has leapt from a backward factory in Hangzhou's silk weaving industry to an advanced one.

For a long time, the first-class product rate of Fuqiang Silk Weaving Factory's silk fabrics only reached about 93%, ranking it as a backward factory in Hangzhou's silk weaving industry. After a meeting and inspection by the factory's Party branch, it was considered that the main reasons were twofold: first, the leadership's concept of quality first was not firm; second, the masses were not fully mobilized to solve the key to quality. After the inspection, the leading cadres unified their thinking, and then called on all factory workers to change the backward situation in a short period of time. Seeing that the leaders were determined, the workers were determined to improve. They offered suggestions and strategies, and posted more than 300 big-character posters within two days.

According to the opinions put forward by the workers, the "Fluorescent Taffeta" silk had more defective products, so the factory leaders decided to break through this barrier first. Therefore, the branch secretary, factory director, office personnel, and veteran workers, a total of more than 40 people, gathered in the "Fluorescent Taffeta" workshop to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the machines, finished products, raw materials, and the relationship between various processes. They quickly found the problems and took practical and effective improvement measures based on the specific conditions of the workshop. As a result, the first-class product rate of "Fluorescent Taffeta" silk reached 100%.

This victory powerfully shattered the superstitious idea that "defective products are inevitable" and encouraged the workers' confidence and determination to further attack the quality barrier. The Party branch held an on-site meeting in this workshop, and the factory quickly launched a mass movement to comprehensively improve product quality. The "oil stains" that were considered the most difficult to prevent in the past have now been eliminated through the efforts of all factory workers. All 84 old machines in the factory have been comprehensively overhauled and strengthened. In this way, the first-class product rate of the factory's products rose from 93.38% to 96%, and then to 99.9%; and from last year to now, it has maintained 100% for seven months, leaping into the advanced ranks of the city.

This newspaper reports: Shanghai Qinggong Paper Mill has greatly improved product quality, and the first-class product rate has rapidly increased.

At the beginning of this year, the quality of the paper produced by this factory was consistently poor. From January to April, the first-class product rate of the entire factory was only 29%, and the first-class product rate of kraft paper was even lower. The reason for this situation was mainly that some people in the factory at that time had right-leaning emotions regarding improving paper quality, emphasizing that the raw material supply did not meet the requirements and that the equipment was outdated, and not seriously thinking of ways to continue to improve product quality. In April of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an industrial conference. This conference, like a strong east wind, dispelled the right-leaning emotions of the factory. After repeated pragmatic discussions, the factory's Party organization further realized that poor product quality is the biggest waste and was determined to quickly reverse the backward situation. Then, it boldly mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement for high yield and high quality. After a month of effort, the results of the industry inspection and evaluation in May showed that four of the factory's five product varieties were rated as first-class, and the paper quality pass rate increased from 29% to 70%. The kraft paper pass rate increased from 7% to 88%, fundamentally reversing the backward situation.

In late May, the higher authorities assigned the production task of "single-sided coated printing paper" to the factory. The quality requirements for this type of paper are very high. The workers in the third workshop, who were responsible for this production task, first grasped the key "four degrees" of single-sided coated paper quality (uniformity, water resistance, dust content, whiteness), and adopted the "three combinations" method, studying, improving, and upgrading simultaneously. After several days of exploration and research, they mastered the operating methods and established systems for cleaning management, quality inspection, raw material management, and process management. Finally, they produced single-sided coated printing paper. According to testing and the evaluation of relevant user units, the quality reached the first class.

The fundamental reason why Qinggong Paper Mill was able to rapidly improve product quality was that it adhered to putting politics in command and at the same time mobilized the masses to make great strides in technological revolution. For example, in the process of improving the quality of kraft paper in the second workshop, cadres and workers fought hard for a month and achieved innovation projects such as "silk thread paper introduction" and "one furnace three uses," conquering the "moisture barrier" and the "paper breaking barrier" in one fell swoop. Then, they improved the operation methods, which greatly improved the strength and smoothness of kraft paper. The factory workers also humbly learned from the advanced experience of fraternal factories and established a relatively sound management system.

This newspaper reports: According to Qingdao Daily: Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 adheres to putting politics in command, conscientiously implements various systems to ensure product quality, and has achieved continuous improvement in the quality of rubber shoes while maintaining high output. The service life of long sneakers was 123.5 days in the first half of last year, increased to 180 days in the second half of last year (the national standard is 170 days), and increased to 240 days in the first half of this year. The service life of Lis shoes was 123.9 days in the first half of last year, increased to 141 days in the second half of last year (the national standard is 140 days), and has increased to 160 days in the first half of this year. The appearance quality of these two types of rubber shoes has also reached the national standards.

The leading cadres of this factory pay great attention to conducting quality education for workers. Each time they convey the quarterly and monthly production plans to the workers, they emphasize the relationship between product output and quality, emphasizing that high output and high quality must be combined, so the idea of ​​high output and high quality is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Sometimes, when quality accidents occur, the leadership always checks more from a subjective perspective, inspiring cadres and workers to learn lessons, further strengthen quality concepts, and constantly fight against complacency that hinders the improvement of product quality.

The leading cadres of this factory also frequently grasp raw material analysis and formulations based on changes in raw materials and new problems that may arise from the use of new technologies, delve into the production site to work with workers, and help solve key problems in improving product quality. For example, in March of this year, the number of raised bubbles on the welts of rubber shoes suddenly increased for a few days. The leaders immediately went deep into the upper welt process of the third workshop and, together with technicians and workers, researched, summarized, and promoted the advanced experience of the short sneaker group of Class A in reducing the number of raised bubbles, which quickly reduced the number of raised bubbles.

A good atmosphere of everyone caring about product quality has been formed in this factory. In the past, some workers thought that quality inspectors were specifically here to find fault, but now workers cooperate closely with inspectors and strictly implement the system of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and layer-by-layer inspection, setting up checkpoints everywhere to effectively ensure product quality.

### 群众献计献策提高产品质量

专栏：

    树立质量第一思想　发扬埋头苦干作风　采取切切实实措施
    群众献计献策提高产品质量
    富强丝织厂连续七个月正品率达100％
    勤工造纸厂迅速改变了质量落后面貌
    青岛橡胶九厂球鞋穿用年限成倍提高
    据新华社杭州电　杭州富强丝织厂职工贯彻质量第一、全面跃进的方针，获得巨大成绩。这个厂生产的绸缎，已有八种可比产品的混合正品率连续七个月达到百分之一百。由于产品质量迅速不断的提高，这个厂已从杭州市丝织业的后进厂跃为先进厂。
    富强丝织厂的绸缎正品率，较长时期仅达到93％左右，在杭州市丝织业中居于后进。厂党支部开会检查以后认为主要原因有二，一是领导方面质量第一的观念不牢固；二是没有充分发动群众来解决质量关键。经过检查，领导干部统一了思想认识，接着便号召全厂职工在短期内改变后进面貌。职工群众看到领导下了决心，都发愤图强。他们纷纷献计献策，在两天之内就贴出了三百多张大字报。
    根据职工们提出的意见，“萤光塔夫”绸的次品较多，工厂领导就下决心首先攻破这一关。于是，支部书记、厂长、课室人员和老工人共四十多人会师“萤光塔夫”车间，对机器、成品、原料和各个工序之间的关系等，进行了全面大检查。他们很快地找出了毛病所在，并且针对本车间具体情况采取了切实有效的改进措施，结果，“萤光塔夫”绸的正品率达到了百分之一百。
    这一胜利，有力地破除了所谓“次品难免”的迷信思想，鼓舞了职工进一步猛攻质量关的信心和决心。党支部在这个车间召开了现场会议，全厂迅速掀起全面提高产品质量的群众运动。过去认为最不易防止的“油污渍”，经过全厂职工人人动手，现在也消灭了。厂里八十四台老机器全面进行检修加固。这样，全厂产品正品率从93.38％上升到96％，又上升到99.9％；而从去年到现在，七个月来一直保持着百分之一百，跃入了全市先进行列。
    本报讯　上海勤工造纸厂大抓产品质量，正品率迅速提高。
    今年年初，这个厂的纸张质量一直较差，1至4月份全厂产品正品率仅达29％，其中牛皮版纸的正品率更低。产生这种情况的原因，主要是当时这个厂有一部分人对提高纸张质量有右倾情绪，强调原料供应不合要求、设备陈旧，而不认真想办法继续提高产品质量。今年4月，中共上海市委召开了工业会议，这次会议如东风劲吹，吹散了这个厂的右倾情绪。厂的党组织经过反复务虚，进一步认识到产品质量不好是最大的浪费，决心迅速扭转落后局面，随即放手发动群众，开展了高产优质的群众运动。经过一个来月的努力，5月份行业检查评比的结果，这个厂五个产品品种就有四个被评为第一类，纸张质量合格率由29％提高到70％，牛皮版纸合格率由7％提高到88％，从根本上扭转了落后局面。
    5月下旬，上级又把“单面胶版印刷纸”的生产任务下达到这个厂。这种纸张的质量要求很高。担负这一生产任务的第三车间职工，首先抓住了单胶纸质量的“四度”关键（均匀度、抗水度、尘埃度、白度），采取“三结合”方法，边研究，边改进，边提高，经过几天的摸索钻研，掌握了操作方法，建立了清洁管理、质量检验、原料管理、工艺管理等制度，终于造出了单面胶版印刷纸，根据测定和有关使用单位的鉴定，质量达到第一流。
    勤工造纸厂所以能够迅速提高产品质量，根本原因是坚持了政治挂帅，同时发动群众大闹技术革命。如二车间改进牛皮版纸质量过程中，干部和群众奋战一月，实现了“丝线引纸”、“一炉三用”等革新项目，一举攻下“水份关”与“断纸关”，紧接着又改进操作方法，使牛皮版纸的强度和光滑度大大提高。这个厂的职工还虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验，建立了一套比较健全的管理制度。
    本报讯　据青岛日报消息：青岛橡胶九厂坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻保证产品质量的各种制度，做到了在高产的同时，胶鞋质量不断提高。长球鞋的穿用寿命，去年上半年是一百二十三点五天，去年下半年提高到一百八十天（国家指标是一百七十天），今年上半年又提高到二百四十天；力士鞋的穿用寿命去年上半年是一百二十三点九天，去年下半年提高到一百四十一天（国家指标是一百四十天），今年上半年已提高到一百六十天。这两种胶鞋的外观质量也都达到了国家规定的标准。
    这个厂领导干部非常注意对工人进行质量教育，每次向职工传达季度和月份生产计划时，都突出讲明产品产量和质量的关系，强调要把高产和优质结合起来，因而高产优质的思想深入人心。有时遇到质量事故，领导上总是多从主观上检查，启发干部和工人接受教训，进一步加强质量观念，不断地与阻碍提高产品质量的自满思想做斗争。
    这个厂的领导干部还根据原材料的变动和采用新技术可能产生的新问题，经常抓原材料分析和配方，深入生产现场同工人一起劳动，帮助解决提高产品质量的关键问题。例如今年3月份有几天胶鞋沿条凸泡忽然增多，领导上立即深入三车间上围条工序，和技术人员、工人一起研究，总结和推广了甲班短球鞋组少出凸泡的先进经验，使沿条凸泡迅速下降。
    这个厂已形成了人人关心产品质量的良好风气。过去有些工人认为质量检验人员是专门来挑毛病的，现在工人都和检查员亲密合作，严格执行自己检查、互相检查、层层检查的制度，处处设卡，有效地保证产品质量。
