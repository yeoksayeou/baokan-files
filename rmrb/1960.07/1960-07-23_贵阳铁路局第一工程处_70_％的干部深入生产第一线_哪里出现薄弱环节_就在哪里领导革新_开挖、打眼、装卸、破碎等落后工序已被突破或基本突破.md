(Our Newspaper, Guiyang, July 22nd) The First Engineering Section of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, after the production increase and conservation movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution last year, has significantly improved its construction technology level. However, because processes such as excavation, drilling, loading, and crushing failed to break through the original operating methods, the innovated processes were thus constrained. In order to quickly change this situation, more than 70% of the cadres of this section responded to the Party's call, went deep into the front lines of production, strengthened leadership over the weak links in technical innovation, and launched a movement to overcome weak links.

In order to quickly overcome these weak links, the cadres who went deep into various construction sites, on the one hand, insisted on eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers, and on the other hand, adopted methods such as observing, listening, and asking questions to promptly understand the situation, find the root cause of the problems, and solve them one by one. Cadres who went deep into the First and Fourth Battalions discovered in their labor that some grassroots cadres and workers had two incorrect thoughts. One was the fear of difficulty, believing that drilling and blasting technology required high skills and was not easy to innovate, and the other was the "valuing foreign over local" thought of pursuing perfection and grandeur. For example, the drilling machines and cranes they were preparing to manufacture could have been made mostly of wood, but they wanted to use steel and iron. Due to the lack of materials, the machinery that could be manufactured was also shelved.

After the cadres discovered these problems, they immediately followed the guiding ideology of "technical revolution taking ideological revolution as the driving force" and closely integrated ideological work with the work of leading technical innovation. On the one hand, they organized workers to criticize the fear of difficulty and the "valuing foreign over local" thought of pursuing perfection and grandeur in technical innovation; on the other hand, they proposed topics and mobilized workers to offer suggestions and ideas, focusing on key aspects such as excavation, drilling, and loading.

At this time, workers Liang Zongqu and Zhao Shaoqing from the First Battalion and workers from the tool section of the Seventh Battalion, made a swing hammer drilling machine and a Young Pioneer-style wooden crane, which increased work efficiency by one time and two and a half times respectively, while also greatly reducing labor intensity. After these two new tools appeared, the "stationed" cadres immediately summarized the experience and promoted it. The Party committee of the engineering section also held a special on-site meeting on these two new tools and widely organized visits. At present, the entire section has basically achieved the mechanization of manual drilling.

With the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement, the cadres further strengthened the leadership of technical innovation. In dealing with key issues in processes such as excavation, drilling, tamping, and loading, the cadres personally participated and helped solve specific problems in innovation. Worker Wang Jincheng from the Second Battalion, in response to the weak link of tamping, prepared to manufacture a sleeve tamping machine with high work efficiency and low labor intensity, but because some technical problems were not solved, it could not be realized for a long time. After Zhang Zhen, the first secretary of the Party committee of the engineering section "stationed" here, learned about it, he immediately organized engineers and veteran workers to study with him. After three days of efforts, the sleeve tamping machine was successfully manufactured.

Through the cadres' down-to-earth work, the construction appearance of backward processes such as excavation, drilling, tamping, and loading in the entire section has been completely renewed. Now, a vivid scene of "drilling without hands, loading and unloading without lifting" has appeared on the construction site. Work efficiency has been further improved. Last year, the average daily output of earth and stone per person in the entire section was less than three cubic meters. In the first half of this year, the average daily output per person has reached more than seven cubic meters, an increase of more than double, ensuring that the entire section has overfulfilled the state plan every month.

### 贵阳铁路局第一工程处70％的干部深入生产第一线  哪里出现薄弱环节　就在哪里领导革新  开挖、打眼、装卸、破碎等落后工序已被突破或基本突破

    贵阳铁路局第一工程处70％的干部深入生产第一线
    哪里出现薄弱环节　就在哪里领导革新
    开挖、打眼、装卸、破碎等落后工序已被突破或基本突破
    本报贵阳22日电　贵阳铁路局第一工程处，经过去年以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，施工技术水平显著提高。但由于开挖、打眼、装卸和碎石等工序未能突破原有操作方法，使已革新的工序因此受到牵制。为了迅速改变这种状况，这个处70％以上的干部响应党的号召，深入生产第一线，加强对技术革新薄弱环节的领导，掀起攻克薄弱环节运动。
    为了迅速克服这些薄弱环节，深入到各工地的干部，一面坚持同工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，一面采取看、听、问等方法，及时了解情况，找出问题的症结，逐个解决。深入到一、四大队的干部在劳动中，首先发现一部分基层干部和工人，存在着两种不正确的思想。一种是认为打眼放炮技术要求高，不好搞革新的畏难思想，一种是求全求大的“重洋轻土”思想。比如他们准备制造的打眼机和吊车，本来大部分零件可以用木材做成，但他们却要用钢、铁来做，由于材料缺乏，能制造的机具也搁浅了。
    干部们发现这些问题后，当即遵循“技术革命以思想革命为动力”的指导思想，把思想工作和领导技术革新的工作紧密结合进行。一面组织工人批判技术革新中的畏难情绪和求全求大的“重洋轻土”思想，另一方面，针对开挖、打眼、装卸等关键，提出课题，发动工人献策献计。
    就在这时候，一大队工人梁宗渠、赵绍清和七大队机具所的工人，制成了甩锤式的打眼机和少先式木吊车，工效分别提高一倍和两倍半，同时还大大减轻了劳动强度。这两件新工具出现以后，“蹲点”的干部立即总结经验宣传推广。工程处党委也以这两种新工具专门召开了现场会，广泛组织参观。目前，全处已基本实现了手工打眼机械化。
    随着技术革新运动的蓬勃开展，干部们进一步加强了技术革新的领导。在对待开挖、打眼、打夯和装卸等工序的关键问题上，干部都亲自参加，帮助解决革新中的具体问题。二大队工人王金成，针对打夯薄弱环节，准备制造一种工效高劳动强度小的套筒打夯机，但由于一部分技术问题没有解决，迟迟不能实现；在这里“蹲点”的工程处党委第一书记张珍同志知道后，马上组织工程师和老工人和他研究。经过三天的努力，即把套筒打夯机制造成功。
    通过干部踏踏实实的工作，全处的开挖、打眼、打夯、装卸等落后工序的施工面貌，已焕然一新。现在，工地上已经出现了“打眼不动手，装卸不用抬”的生动场面。工效进一步提高。去年全处每人日产土石方平均不到三立方米，今年上半年每人平均日产已达到七立方米多，增加了一倍以上，保证全处月月超额完成了国家计划。
