Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 16th: The Indian government is intensifying its high-pressure tactics to suppress the ongoing strike by government employees and persecute strike participants. According to a Reuters report on the 15th, the government has arrested at least 6,000 people so far. The Press Trust of India reported that three members of the Indian Communist Party were arrested by the government in Calcutta on the 15th.

According to today's "Hindustan Times," as of now, 1,800 government employees in Calcutta have received suspension orders, and another 2,000 temporary employees have been ordered to cease their duties. In Bombay, more than 500 temporary workers have received dismissal notices, and 175 permanent workers have been suspended. According to a Press Trust of India dispatch from Bombay, the Indian government's postal, customs, and other departments published almost a full-page notice in the newspaper on the 15th, individually notifying employees by name that they had been dismissed.

The official Indian News Service had to admit on the 14th that "in many central areas, the maintenance of the main work of the central government agencies has been possible mainly due to the large-scale use of armed forces personnel."

Some news revealed by the Indian press indicates that government employees in many parts of India, regardless of the government's various suppression measures, continue to persist in their struggle.

The "Hindustan Times" said, "In the morning, the attendance rate of the civil aviation department was about 10%." The newspaper also reported that the attendance rate of the telegraph and telephone departments and customs in Bombay was only about 20% to 30%.

Today's "Statesman" reported that in the civil aviation department, the attendance rate of employees in the Santa Cruz airport management sector is still less than 10%. In Baroda and Ahmedabad, only 30% of employees are on duty. A Press Trust of India message on the 15th also said that civil aviation technicians in Calcutta and Bombay are still not working, and their work is now being maintained by Indian Air Force personnel.

According to the "Statesman," in Madhya Pradesh, yesterday "fourth-class employees of the Bhopal postal department went on strike suddenly." Yesterday's Press Trust of India message also said that postal and telecommunications employees in Nagpur in Maharashtra, Raipur and Bilaspur in Madhya Pradesh, and other places are still on strike. Today's "Hindustan Times" reported that in Madras, the attendance rate of the three postal institutions of the General Post Office, the Central Telegraph Office, and the Railway Post Office continues to decline.

According to a Press Trust of India report on the 15th, there are still "troubles" on many sections of the railway between Calcutta and Ahmedabad via Baroda, Gujarat. The army personnel have replaced the work of the strikers on the section of the railway from Katihar to Siliguri due to "abnormalities."

The official Indian News Service also admitted on the 15th that employees of fourteen defense institutions are still on strike. Many jute mills in and around Calcutta have stopped work.

　　印度政府加紧镇压罢工雇员
　　全国被捕者达六千人　大批人员被停职解雇
    新华社16日讯　新德里消息：印度政府正在加紧采取高压手段镇压还在继续进行的政府雇员的罢工和迫害罢工参加者。据路透社15日报道，政府到现在为止至少已经逮捕了六千人。印度报业托辣斯报道说，印度共产党有三名议员15日已在加尔各答被政府逮捕。
    据今天的“印度斯坦时报”报道，加尔各答到目前为止，已经有一千八百名政府雇员接到停职的命令，另外有两千名临时雇员奉命停止供职。在孟买，也有五百多名临时职工接到了解雇通知，一百七十五名长期职工已被停职。据印度报业托辣斯发自孟买的消息说，印度政府邮电、海关等部门15日在报上登载了几乎占一版篇幅的告示，一一指名通知雇员个人说他们解雇了。
    官方的印度新闻处14日不得不承认，“在许多中心区，维持中央政府机构的主要工作之所以成为可能，主要是由于大规模使用武装部队的人员。”
    印度报界透露出的一些消息表明，印度许多地方的政府雇员不顾政府各种镇压措施，继续在坚持进行斗争。
      “印度斯坦时报”说，“在上午，民用航空部门的出勤人数大约为10％。”这家报纸还报道说，孟买的电报和电话部门以及海关的出勤率也只有20％到30％左右。
    今天的“政治家报”报道说，在民用航空部门中，圣克卢斯机场管理方面到目前为止雇员的出勤人数仍旧不到10％。在巴罗达和阿麦达巴，也只有30％的雇员在值勤。15日的印度报业托辣斯消息也说，加尔各答和孟买的民航技术人员仍旧不上班，他们的工作现在依靠印度空军人员在维持。
    据“政治家报”报道，在中央邦，昨天“波保尔邮务部门的四等雇员突然罢工”。昨天的印度报业托辣斯消息还说，马哈拉斯特拉邦的那格浦尔，中央邦的赖普尔、比拉斯普尔等地方的邮电部门雇员仍旧在罢工。今天的“印度斯坦时报”报道，在马德拉斯，邮政总局的三个邮政机构、中央电报局和铁道邮政的出勤人数还在继续下降。
    据印度报业托辣斯15日报道，加尔各答和古吉拉特邦巴罗达到阿麦达巴之间不少地段的铁路也仍旧有“麻烦”。加第哈到西里古里一段的铁路由于“不正常”，陆军人员已经代替了罢工者的工作。
    官方的印度新闻处15日还承认，有十四个国防机构的雇员也仍旧在罢工。加尔各答市内和周围的不少黄麻厂已经停工。
