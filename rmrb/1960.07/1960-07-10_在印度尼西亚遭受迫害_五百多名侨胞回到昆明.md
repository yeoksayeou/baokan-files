Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 9th: More than 500 returned overseas Chinese who were persecuted in Indonesia, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue residing there, arrived in Kunming by train in batches on the 7th and 8th. They were warmly welcomed and cordially received by people of all ethnic groups in Kunming.

The trains carrying the returned overseas Chinese arrived in Kunming late at night. Waiting at the station were Wang Zhaoming, Deputy Director of the Yunnan Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Li Yougui, Director of the Office of the Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; Deputy Director Wang Bo; Zhang Xiangshi, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; He Xiuqing and Zheng Jiaqi, Deputy Directors of the Kunming Municipal Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; and more than 500 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life. They set off firecrackers, beat gongs and drums. The responsible cadres warmly shook hands with the returned overseas Chinese, welcoming them to Yunnan to participate in socialist construction.

This group of returned overseas Chinese had resided in Jakarta and Central Java in Indonesia for generations, relying on working in cities or running small businesses in rural areas to make a living. Returned overseas Chinese from Central Java revealed that after influential groups in Indonesia stirred up anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, they were groundlessly forced to cease operations, cutting off their livelihoods. Many were in dire straits before returning to China. The returned overseas Chinese were extremely indignant after hearing about the bloody crime of the West Java military authorities in Indonesia shooting and killing overseas Chinese women. The returned overseas Chinese expressed their firm support for the strong protest lodged by our Ambassador Huang Zhen to the Indonesian government regarding this matter, and unanimously demanded that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, provide compensation to the families of the deceased, release the arrested overseas Chinese, and immediately stop the forced relocations and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

    在印度尼西亚遭受迫害
    五百多名侨胞回到昆明
    新华社昆明9日电　五百多名在印度尼西亚遭受迫害、无以为生或不愿在当地继续居留的归国华侨，在七、八两日分批乘火车到达昆明，受到昆明市各族各界群众的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。
    侨胞们乘坐的火车在深夜抵达昆明，等候在车站上的云南省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任、省归国华侨联合会主席王昭明，省接待和安置归国华侨委员会办公室主任李有桂、副主任王波，省归国华侨联合会副主席张相时，昆明市接待和安置归国华侨委员会办公室副主任何秀卿、郑家祺等以及各族各界群众五百多人，燃放鞭炮，敲锣打鼓，负责干部们和侨胞亲切握手，欢迎他们到云南参加社会主义建设。
    这批归侨世代侨居在印度尼西亚雅加达和中爪哇地区，依靠在城市做工或在乡村经营小商业维持生活。来自中爪哇地区的侨胞揭露，在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起反华排华活动后，他们无端被迫停业，断绝了生路，许多人在回国前已经处于绝境。归侨们听到印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局枪杀华侨妇女的血腥罪行后，非常愤慨。归侨们表示坚决拥护我国黄镇大使就这件事向印度尼西亚政府提出的严重抗议，一致要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手，抚恤死难者家属，释放被捕华侨，并立即停止迫迁和保证不再发生类似事件。
