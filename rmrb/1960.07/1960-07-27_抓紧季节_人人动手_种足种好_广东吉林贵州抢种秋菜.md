Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th. Public canteens in rural people's communes in Guangdong Province are doing everything possible to expand the area under vegetable cultivation. To date, more than 200,000 canteens across the province have planted over 1.1 million mu of various melons and vegetables. Due to the strengthening of vegetable management in various regions, many canteens have not only achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables but can also provide some commercial vegetables to the market.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to canteen production, requiring canteens in various regions to plant an average of one fen of vegetables, oil crops, and coarse grains per person to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables and oil. In addition to allocating some land to canteens, people's communes in various areas have also mobilized members to reclaim large areas of wasteland during their spare time and make full use of scattered plots of land to grow vegetables. They are also implementing intercropping, overlapping cropping, and multiple cropping to maximize land utilization, ensuring that vegetable production remains evergreen throughout the four seasons, with sowing every ten days and harvests every month. Currently, while ensuring the quantity of vegetables, canteens in various regions are focusing on the variety and quality of vegetables.

This newspaper, Changchun, 26th. Party committees at all levels in Jilin Province are seizing the current excellent opportunity to sow autumn vegetables, launching a mass movement to rush-plant autumn vegetables on a province-wide scale. Since the beginning of July, the province has sown over 570,000 mu of radishes, cabbages, mustard greens, and other vegetables in less than twenty days. At the same time, various localities are strengthening the management of existing spring vegetables, prompting a daily increase in the market supply of various fresh spring vegetables.

During the rush-planting of autumn vegetables, various localities have expanded the sowing area of autumn vegetables in every possible way, based on the principle of combining more planting with more harvesting and high yield with more harvesting. Various localities have surveyed the land, planned the land, tapped the potential of the land, and adopted methods such as intercropping, mixed cropping, strip cropping, and planting between rows to sow autumn vegetables. The Chengxi and Datun communes in the suburbs of Changchun City have already overfulfilled their autumn vegetable sowing plans. To ensure a high-yield and bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, various localities have also rationally adjusted labor organization and tapped the potential of tools, based on the characteristics of this year's summer, which has been characterized by more rain, wet land, and large sowing volume. They have generally adopted the method of "three sides" (preparing the land, applying fertilizer, and sowing seeds simultaneously) for sowing, thereby accelerating the progress and improving the quality.

The rush-planting of autumn vegetables is now being carried out in depth throughout the province. Cadres of organs, teachers and students of schools, and workers of factories and mines are actively carrying out the "no idle land movement" to plant more autumn vegetables, and they are also transferring large amounts of manpower and materials to rural areas to support the rush-planting of autumn vegetables. In the suburbs of Changchun City alone, more than 20,000 people have been dispatched from various organs, factories, and schools.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 26th. People's communes in various parts of Guizhou Province are seizing the season to carry out a concentrated campaign to sow autumn vegetables while doing a good job in the field management of summer vegetables. Tongren, Anshun, Qiannan, and Qiandongnan four special districts and autonomous prefectures had planted more than 163,000 mu of vegetables by the 20th.

Party organizations at all levels in Guizhou attach great importance to vegetable production. Since the beginning of June, various localities have made arrangements for the land, labor, and other specific issues related to planting autumn vegetables. The Zunyi Municipal Committee held a special telephone conference to deploy the autumn vegetable sowing work. The secretary of the Municipal Committee also led more than 12,000 people in a concentrated effort to plant vegetables.

Various localities pay close attention to the quality of sowing, which is generally better than in previous years. The 14,000 mu of autumn vegetables already sown in Zunyi City have all been appropriately densely planted and have received sufficient base fertilizer. At the same time, the principle of "planting while managing" is implemented, ensuring that the vegetables are planted well and managed well. In the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, each county has organized a working group to go deep into the grassroots to help improve the field management of autumn vegetables.

    抓紧季节　人人动手　种足种好
    广东吉林贵州抢种秋菜
    新华社广州26日电　广东省农村人民公社公共食堂千方百计扩大蔬菜种植面积，到目前止，全省二十多万个食堂已种下各类瓜菜一百一十多万亩。由于各地加强了对蔬菜的管理，许多地区的食堂不仅已实现了蔬菜自给，而且还能为市场提供一部分商品蔬菜。
    中共广东省委对于食堂生产非常重视，要求各地食堂平均每人要种植蔬菜、油料、杂粮一分地，以实现蔬菜、油料自给。各地人民公社除拨出一部分土地给食堂外，还发动社员利用业余时间大量开荒和充分利用零星土地种植蔬菜，并实行间种、套种、复种，最大限度地提高土地利用率，使蔬菜生产做到四季常青，旬旬播种，月月收成。现在，各地食堂在保证蔬菜数量的同时，正大抓蔬菜的品种质量。
    本报长春26日电　吉林省各级党委抓住当前播种秋菜的大好时机，发动群众掀起了全民规模的抢种秋菜运动。全省从7月初以来，不足二十天的时间就播种萝卜、白菜、芥菜等达五十七万多亩，同时各地对现有春菜加强管理，促使各种春鲜菜上市量日益增加。
    在抢种秋菜运动中，各地都根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，千方百计扩大秋菜播种面积。各地实地勘查，规划土地，挖掘土地潜力，采取套种、混种、间种、插种等方法播种秋菜。长春市郊区城西、大屯等公社目前已超额完成了秋菜播种计划。为确保秋菜高产丰收，各地还根据今年夏季雨多、地湿、播种量大的特点，合理地调整劳动组织，挖掘工具潜力，普遍采取三边（边整地、边施肥、边播种）的办法进行播种，因而加快了进度，又提高了质量。
    现在抢种秋菜运动正在全省深入开展，机关干部、学校师生、厂矿工人一面积极开展“无空闲地运动”多种秋菜，一面抽调大批人力、物力到农村支援抢种秋菜。仅长春市郊区的各机关、工厂、学校就出动二万多人。
    新华社贵阳26日电　贵州省各地人民公社在作好夏菜田间管理的同时，抓紧季节突击播种秋菜。铜仁、安顺、黔南、黔东南四个专区、自治州到20日已种菜一十六万三千多亩。
    贵州各级党组织对蔬菜生产很重视。从6月上旬起，各地对种植秋菜的土地、劳力等具体问题，都先后作了安排。遵义市委专门召开了电话会议，布置秋菜播种工作。市委书记还率领一万二千多人突击种菜。
    各地十分注意播种质量，一般都比往年种得好。遵义市已播种的一万四千亩秋菜，都适当密植，施足了底肥。同时实行边种边管，种好管好。在黔东南苗族侗族自治州，每个县都组织一个工作组深入到基层，帮助搞好秋菜田间管理。
