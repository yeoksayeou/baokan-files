    Learn from Li Gong, Be a Good Son and Daughter of the Party and the People
    ——Recommending "Red Flag Bearer" and "Literary Special Issue on Red Doctor Li Gong"
    The July issue of the "Red Flag Bearer" literary monthly published in Lanzhou features a "Literary Special Issue on Red Doctor Li Gong."
    The "Special Issue" contains eulogies by Comrades Xie Juezai and Li Dequan, the long poem "The Biography of Li Gong" written in the form of a poetic drama by the poet Li Ji, the poem "Dedicated to Li Gong" by the poet Wen Jie, the collective creation "Red Doctor" by the Lanzhou Art Institute Experimental Troupe, the film literary script "Doctor on the Grassland," as well as short stories, woodcuts, paper cuttings, and valuable memoirs written by comrades who once lived and worked with Comrade Li Gong. These works enthusiastically praise Comrade Li Gong for dedicating his youthful life to the happiness and health of the Tibetan people, and from different angles, they demonstrate the unwavering loyalty of our era's heroes to serving the people, and his noble communist spirit of utter selflessness. This is a good reading material for educating the broad masses and the younger generation.
    From this "Special Issue," people can see how Li Gong, a young red doctor cultivated by the Party, created brilliant achievements in this ordinary yet arduous work post. He always listened to the Party and was willing to sacrifice everything for the benefit of the Party and the people. He embodied the Party's ethnic policies with his own flesh and blood, strengthened the connection between the Party and the Tibetan people, and enhanced the Party's prestige among the Tibetan people. In 1956, in order to cure the severe burns of Cao Jia, a Tibetan working woman, Comrade Li Gong unhesitatingly cut four pieces of skin from his own leg to perform a skin graft. In order to save more than a dozen Tibetan people from dying of typhoid fever, he disregarded his own recent recovery from a serious illness and resolutely drew his own blood to inject them. In order to rescue a dying child with measles, he stayed by the child's side for five days and four nights. His heroic actions of wholeheartedly serving the people of the grassland have been widely circulated among the Tibetan people of Gannan, and the Tibetan people affectionately praised him as a "good 'Manba' (doctor) sent by Chairman Mao." Last December, he unfortunately passed away while participating in a delegation to慰问刘家峡 representing outdoor workers. Comrade Li Gong dedicated his glorious life to the great socialist construction cause of the motherland and to the Tibetan people on the grassland, and he deserved the glorious title of "good doctor sent by Chairman Mao." He will always live in the hearts of the Tibetan people in the Gannan grassland.
    We know from the memoirs of Comrade Li Gong's wife how Comrade Li Gong listened to the Party and demanded to be the strongest communist fighter. He often said to his wife: I am a doctor trained by the Party. The Party sent us to work on the grassland because it believes that we can withstand the test of difficult environments. We cannot let the Party down. We must be strong people, red doctors of the Mao Zedong era. He worked diligently and never bowed to difficulties. He deeply realized that the Party sent him to the grassland to treat Tibetan people, which was not just a matter of treating diseases, but also related to the Party's prestige, a political issue, which could only be treated well and not badly. Therefore, he completed the tasks assigned by the Party with a selfless spirit, even at the expense of his own flesh and blood. He was not only a good doctor who could cure diseases, but also educated and improved the ideological awareness of the broad masses of Tibetan people through his actions.
    The "Literary Special Issue on Red Doctor Li Gong" is a valuable learning material contributed to readers in response to the call of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China to learn from the communist spirit of Comrade Li Gong and make greater contributions to socialist construction. Although these works were rushed out in a short period of time, we also saw the real, vivid, and moving image of Comrade Li Gong from them. He will encourage us to strive to be good sons and daughters of the Party and the people in today's leaping era and take bigger steps to build the socialist motherland.

    学习李贡，做党和人民的好儿女
    ——推荐《红旗手》《红色医生李贡文艺专号》
    兰州出版的《红旗手》文艺月刊七月号，出了《红色医生李贡文艺专号》。
    《专号》刊登了谢觉哉和李德全同志的赞诗，诗人李季用诗剧形式写成的长诗《李贡传》，诗人闻捷《献给李贡的诗》，还有兰州艺术学院实验剧团集体创作的《红色医生》，电影文学剧本《草原上的医生》，还有小说、木刻和剪纸，以及曾经同李贡同志一起生活和工作过的同志写的宝贵的回忆散文。这些热情洋溢地歌颂了李贡同志为藏族人民的幸福和健康献出了自己年青的一生的作品，从不同角度表现了我们时代英雄人物为人民服务的耿耿忠心，和他毫无利己之心的崇高的共产主义风格。这是一本教育广大群众和青年一代的好读物。
    从这本《专号》里，人们可以看到党培养出来的青年红色医生李贡，怎样地在这平凡而艰苦的工作岗位上创造了光辉的业绩。他永远听党的话，为了党和人民的利益，不惜牺牲一切。他用自己的血肉，体现了党的民族政策，密切了党与藏族人民的联系，提高了党在藏族人民中的威信。1956年，为了治好藏族劳动妇女曹加的严重烧伤，李贡同志毫不犹豫地割下自己腿上的四块皮来施行植皮手术。为了免除十几个藏族人民死于伤寒，他不顾自己大病初愈，毅然抽出自己的鲜血，给他们注射。为了抢救一个患麻疹的垂死病孩，他五天四夜守护在孩子身旁。他的全心全意为草原人民服务的英雄行为，在甘南藏族人民中广泛流传，藏族人民热爱地称颂他是“毛主席派来的好‘曼巴’（医生）”。去年12月，在参加慰问野外工作人员代表团到刘家峡慰问时，不幸逝世。李贡同志把自己光辉的一生献给了祖国壮丽的社会主义建设事业，献给了草原上的藏族人民，无愧于“毛主席派来的好医生”这一光荣称号，他将永远活在甘南草原藏族人民的心中。
    我们从李贡同志爱人的回忆文中知道，李贡同志是如何听党的话，要求做一个最坚强的共产主义战士。他常对他爱人说：我是党培养的一个医生，党派我们到草原上来工作，就是相信我们能经得起艰苦环境的考验，我们不能辜负党的信任，我们要做一个坚强的人，毛泽东时代的红色医生。他在工作中勤勤恳恳，从来不向困难低头。他深深体会到党派他到草原上来给藏民治病，不仅仅是个治病问题，而且关系着党的威信，是个政治问题，只能尽力治好，不能治坏。因此他以忘我的精神，甚至不惜自己的血肉来完成党交给自己的任务。他不仅是好医生，能治好病，而且以他的行动教育和提高了广大藏族人民的思想觉悟。
    《红色医生李贡文艺专号》是为响应中共甘肃省委关于学习李贡同志共产主义精神，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献的号召，给读者贡献的一份可贵的学习材料。这些作品虽然是短时间内赶出来的，但我们也从中看到了李贡同志真实、生动、鲜明的感人形象，他将鼓舞我们在今天的跃进时代中，努力做党和人民的好儿女，为建设社会主义祖国迈开更大的脚步。
