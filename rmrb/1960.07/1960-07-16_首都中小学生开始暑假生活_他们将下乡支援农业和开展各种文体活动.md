　　Elementary and Middle School Students in the Capital Begin Summer Vacation
　　They Will Go to the Countryside to Support Agriculture and Carry Out Various Cultural and Sports Activities

    (Our report) On the 15th, middle and elementary school students in Beijing began their happy and meaningful summer vacation.
      "Let's go, support agriculture!" Middle school students above the third grade in all urban areas and some near suburban areas of the city enthusiastically prepared to support agricultural production as soon as their summer vacation started. More than 35,000 people are ready to depart separately on the 16th to the People's Communes in Changping, Tongxian, Haidian, Fengtai and other counties and districts in the suburbs. They will eat, live and work with the commune members for a week in order to achieve a double harvest in production and ideology through labor.
    During the vacation, in order to better educate students on revolutionary traditions, the Three Red Banners, and the political situation, all schools have called on students to consciously study current affairs, pay close attention to the development of the international and domestic situation, and persist in studying Chairman Mao's works. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has recommended a batch of excellent novels, songs, movies, and dramas reflecting the people's revolutionary struggle to the students. The Communist Youth League District Committees of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Xuanwu, and Chongwen districts have all proposed that each student read at least one or two good books.
    During the summer vacation, in order to allow students to get adequate rest and have a happy and meaningful time, and to welcome the new semester with more energy and a healthier physique, the city and various districts will carry out a variety of colorful activities. In order to more widely carry out mass scientific and technological popularization activities in primary and secondary schools, the Beijing Children's Science and Technology Museum will organize 500,000 person-times to participate in eight science and technology summer camps, including radio, aviation models, motors, chemical engineering, astronomy, meteorology, ship models, and navigation, as well as one-day summer camps and meetings with scientists. In August, a city-wide exhibition of scientific and technological works by middle and primary schools will be held, and Chongwen and other districts will also hold middle and small literary and art performances. The Municipal Sports Commission will also hold various sports competitions among young people.

　　首都中小学生开始暑假生活
　　他们将下乡支援农业和开展各种文体活动
    本报讯　15日，北京市中、小学生开始了愉快而有意义的暑假生活。
      “走，支援农业去！”全市城区和部分近郊区各中学初中三年级以上的学生们，刚放暑假，就热情地准备去支援农业生产。已有三万五千多人准备好16日分头出发到郊区昌平、通县、海淀、丰台等县区人民公社去，将和社员们同吃同住同劳动一个星期，以便通过劳动获得生产、思想双丰收。
    在假期中，为了更好地向学生进行革命传统、三面红旗和政治形势的教育，各校都号召学生们要自觉学习时事，密切关心国际国内形势的发展，和坚持学习毛主席著作。共青团北京市委已向学生们推荐了一批反映人民革命斗争的优秀小说、歌曲、电影和戏剧。东城、西城、宣武、崇文等区的共青团区委，都向学生提出每人至少读一至两本好书的号召。
    暑假中，为使学生们可以得到充分的休息，又过得愉快而有意义，以更加充沛的精力和健壮的体格迎接新的学期，全市和各区将要开展丰富多彩的活动。北京市少年科学技术馆为了更广泛地在中小学中开展群众性的科学技术普及活动，暑假期间，他们将和有关单位组织五十万人次参加无线电、航空模型、电机、化工、天文、气象、舰船模型和航海等八个科技夏令营，和一日夏令营、以及和科学家见面等项活动。8月份将举办全市中、小学科学技术作品展览会，崇文等区还将举行中、小文艺会演。市体委还要在青少年中举办各种体育竞赛。
