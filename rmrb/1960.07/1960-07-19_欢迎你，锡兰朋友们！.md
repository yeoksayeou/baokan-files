　　Welcome, Friends from Ceylon!
　　Sun Guangyan
    Ceylon, is a beautiful island nation, a colorful grand garden.

    After seeing the performance of the Ceylon Dance Troupe in our capital, I recalled the unforgettable time I lived there. Just like the impression the dance troupe's performance left on us, the people who grow up there are an optimistic and brave nation. The people of Ceylon love to sing and dance, and they are even more proud of the "Kandyan Dance." I remember that every festival night, people would sit around colorful sheds decorated with coconut palm leaves, light coconut oil lamps made of coconut shells, and sing and dance; the dancers would sing and dance to their hearts' content, each displaying their unique skills, forgetting the time, forgetting that the coconut oil lamps in their hands had gone out, and the viewers would watch with increasing excitement, often singing along.

    The "Kandyan Dance" performed by the dance troupe this time is a typical ethnic dance of Ceylon, with a long history and strong ethnic characteristics. The "Kandyan Dance" is divided into two types: religious ritual dances and non-religious performance dances for pure enjoyment. The people of Ceylon love the "Kandyan Dance" because the people living in the Kandyan region are brave and strong, and they have repeatedly defeated colonial invaders.

    From the dance troupe's performance, we saw "Panduru Naduma" which expresses combat, "Harvest Dance" and "Water Fetching Dance" which depict the joyful labor of farmers, and "Vannama" which describes the travels of ancient kings and princes and the lives of various animals. "Vannama" is a widely popular and enthusiastically welcomed dance in Ceylon. It is danced and sung, and includes eighteen songs, such as descriptions of the simple and strong elephant bathing and drinking water; the majestic eagle flying high in the sky; and the beloved images of beautiful swans and butterflies. All of these are vividly expressed by the dancers, fully demonstrating the brave and optimistic character of this nation. Special mention should be made of Mr. Gunaya, the oldest dancer in the dance troupe. His accurate and skilled performance left an extremely deep impression. His performance of "Udala Vannama," which is the king's pace, deeply portrays a noble and dignified image of a king from his movements to his expressions. Like many outstanding dancers, he has his own unique style and rich artistic expression and appeal, so the people of Ceylon give him extremely high praise and love. His performance also brought great joy to our Chinese audience.

    The Ceylonese dance music, which is inseparable from dance, also has its unique features. The accompanying instrument is only a long leather drum hanging around the neck and reaching to the waist. The drummer strikes the two ends of the drum, emitting different beats. The drumming technique is very high, the rhythm is sometimes slow and sometimes fast, sometimes simple and sometimes extremely complex. It can follow the dancer's emotions and movements, strike out a variety of different rhythms, and assist the dancer in expressing the plot of the dance. The drummer must be familiar with the dance and the dancer's characteristics, so most excellent dancers have their own close collaborator - the drummer. This time, from the dance troupe's performance, we saw that Mr. Adin's drumming skills are very amazing.

    Chinese dance was greatly welcomed and praised by the people of Ceylon when it was performed in Ceylon. Many Ceylonese friends said to me: "I hope that one day Ceylonese dance can appear in front of the Chinese audience." This wish has come true today. We believe that the Chinese audience will love Ceylonese dance as much as the people of Ceylon love our art. Let us wish the dance troupe's visiting performance a great success.

### 欢迎你，锡兰朋友们！

　　欢迎你，锡兰朋友们！
　　孙光言
    锡兰，是一个美丽的岛国，一个彩色的大花园。
    看了锡兰舞蹈团在我国首都的演出，使我回忆起曾在那儿生活过的难忘情景。正像舞蹈团的表演给我们留下的印象一样，生长在那儿的是一个乐观勇敢的民族。锡兰人民喜歌善舞，他们更以《康堤舞》而自豪。记得每逢节日晚上，人们围坐在用椰树叶装饰起来的彩棚下，点上用椰皮制作的椰油灯，边歌边舞；舞蹈者们尽情地唱尽情地跳，各人都将自己独特的演技表演出来，以至忘记了时间，忘记了拿在手中的椰油灯熄灭了，看的人们也越看越兴高彩烈，时时随声同唱。
    这次舞蹈团演出的《康堤舞》，是锡兰典型的民族舞，它有着悠久的历史和浓厚的民族色彩。《康堤舞》分为宗教性的仪礼舞和非宗教性专供欣赏娱乐的表演舞二种。锡兰人民喜爱《康堤舞》，是因为住在康堤地区的人民勇敢、强悍，他们曾多次击败了殖民者的侵入。
    从舞蹈团的表演中，我们看到有表现战斗的《潘蒂鲁·纳都玛》和农民欢乐劳动的《收割舞》、《取水舞》，以及描写古代国王、王子出行和各种动物生活的《凡纳玛》。《凡纳玛》在锡兰是一种流行广泛并受到热烈欢迎的舞蹈，它是边舞边唱的，其中共有十八首颂歌，如述说淳朴强健的大象洗澡、饮水；雄壮的雄鹰在高空飞翔；被人们喜爱的美丽的天鹅和蝴蝶等可爱的形象。这些全被舞蹈家们用生动的舞姿表现出来了，充分地表现了这一民族勇敢、乐观的性格。特别应当提出的是舞蹈团中最老的舞蹈家古纳亚先生，他那准确纯熟的演技，给人留下了极为深刻的印象，他所表演的《乌达拉·凡纳玛》即国王的步伐，从动作到表情都非常深刻地刻划出一个尊贵、威严的国王的形象，他像许多优秀的舞蹈家一样，有着自己独特的风格和充实的艺术表现力及感染力，因此锡兰人民给他以极高的称赞与热爱。他的表演也给我们中国观众带来了极大的喜悦。
    与舞蹈不可分割的锡兰舞蹈音乐，也有它独特之处。伴奏的乐器只是一个挂在脖子上垂至腰间的长形皮鼓，鼓手拍击鼓的二端，发出不同的节拍，击鼓的技术很高，节奏时缓时紧，有时简单有时又极其复杂，它能跟随舞者的情绪、动作变化，击出多种不同的节奏并协助舞者表现舞的情节。鼓手要熟悉舞蹈和舞者的特点，因此大多数优秀的舞蹈家，全有自己密切的合作者——鼓手。这次，从舞蹈团的表演中，我们看到了阿丁先生的击鼓技巧是非常惊人的。
    中国舞蹈在锡兰演出时曾受到锡兰人民极大的欢迎和赞扬，不少锡兰朋友对我说：“希望有一天锡兰舞蹈能在中国观众面前出现”。这一愿望今天实现了。我们相信，中国观众一定会像锡兰人民热爱我国的艺术一样热爱锡兰的舞蹈，让我们预祝舞蹈团的访问演出获得极大的成功。
