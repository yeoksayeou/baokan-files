To the Congo
Yan Chen
Let our song, with its supreme respect, with the strength of 650 million people, cross mountains and traverse waves, to the Congo, to the heart of Africa!
	To shatter the shackles of colonialism, you have waged eighty years of tenacious struggle. Finally, in the skies above black Africa, breaking through the long night, a brilliant dawn has risen.
	You know, you have precious mineral deposits—diamonds, copper, gold, and uranium—but even more precious is the awakened people, and the national independence and freedom they have won.
	But the robbers are unwilling to give up and want to strangle the republic in its cradle. You have just broken out of one cage, and they want to replace it with another. Steel fists are in the coconut groves, and flames of anger burn across the entire land.
	Fight on, heroic Congolese brothers! The vast people of the world stand by your side.
	Drive out the Belgian troops! "Apply violent actions" against the aggressors! Sever the evil black hands of U.S. imperialism and warn them that Africa is by no means the "vacuum" they dream of.

    致刚果
    严辰让我们的歌带着崇高的敬意，带着六亿五千万人民的力量，越过丛山，穿过波涛，送到刚果，送给你非洲的心脏！为了打碎殖民主义的枷锁，你进行了八十年的顽强斗争，终于，在黑非洲大陆上空，冲破长夜，升起了灿烂的黎明。你知道，你有珍贵的矿藏——金刚钻、铜、黄金和铀，更珍贵的是觉醒了的人民，争取到的民族的独立和自由。可是，强盗们不肯干休，想把共和国扼死在摇篮里，你刚刚冲出了一个牢笼，他们又想用另一个牢笼来代替。椰树丛里是钢铁的拳头，整个的国土上是愤怒的火焰，斗争吧，英勇的刚果兄弟，世界广大人民站在你们一边。把比利时军队赶出去！对侵略者必须“施加暴力行动”；斩断美帝国主义罪恶的黑手，警告他，非洲绝不是他们妄想的
    “真空”。
