Deng Wei's "Five-Character" Treasure

"Wherever Deng Wei goes, progress follows." This is a comment from the employees of the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Department about Comrade Deng Wei, the deputy manager of the Municipal Construction Engineering Company No. 1.

The employees praise Deng Wei this way not because he has extraordinary abilities, but because they admire his ability to persist in going deep into the front line of production, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses to solve production problems, turning backwardness into advancement. Let's talk about a story from this year: Since the beginning of this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" at the Guangzhou No. 104 construction site has not been bad, but the construction efficiency has not improved. This is indeed a strange thing. In May, the company's Party general branch decided to send Comrade Deng Wei to serve as the construction site branch secretary. After arriving at the construction site, he mobilized the masses to discuss and study, and quickly found the reasons such as the vague understanding of the idea of "four modernizations" guaranteeing production. Then he mobilized the masses to consolidate, promote, and improve the "four modernizations" projects. Construction efficiency rose rapidly. As a result, the workload completed in June was almost double that of May.

Why does the appearance of the construction site change drastically as soon as Deng Wei arrives? It turns out that he has been persisting in going deep into the front line of production for several years and has summed up a set of leadership experience. That is: fast, deep, accurate, tight, and comprehensive. The so-called fast means that the implementation of the Party's instructions is fast, and the action must be fast; deep means to go deep into the site and deep into the masses; accurate means to grasp the main contradictions and solve them in time; tight and comprehensive means that the leadership work must be grasped tightly and comprehensively. Because he went deep into the front line of production, consulted with the masses on everything, and had this "five-character" experience, his leadership work was outstanding, and the masses praised him in unison.

### 邓伟的“五字”宝

　　邓伟的“五字”宝
    “邓伟到了哪里，哪里就先进。”这是广州市建筑部门职工对市建筑工程一公司副经理邓伟同志的一句评语。
    职工们这样夸奖邓伟，并不是说他有天大的本事，而是赞赏他能够坚持深入生产第一线，依靠群众，发动群众解决生产上的难题，把落后变成先进。就说今年的一个故事吧：广州市一零四工地，今年以来，以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动开展得并不坏，可是施工效率却没有提高。这确是件怪事。5月份，公司党总支决定把邓伟同志派去作工地支部书记，他到了工地，发动群众讨论研究，很快就找到了“四化”保生产的思想不明确等方面的原因。接着他发动群众抓紧“四化”项目巩固、推广和提高。施工效率迅速上升。结果6月完成的工作量比5月将近翻了一番。
    为什么邓伟一到，工地面貌就大变呢？原来他在几年来一直坚持深入生产第一线，总结了一套领导工作经验。这就是：快、深、准、紧、全。所谓快就是贯彻党的指示快，行动要快；深，就是要深入现场，深入群众；准，就是要抓住主要矛盾及时解决；紧和全就是领导工作要抓得紧，抓得全面。由于他深入了生产第一线，遇事和群众商量，又有了这“五字”经验，因而领导工作做得出色，群众同声赞好。
