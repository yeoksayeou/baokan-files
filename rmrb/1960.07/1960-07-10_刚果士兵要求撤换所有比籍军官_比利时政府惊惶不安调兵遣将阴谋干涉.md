Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Leopoldville: The struggle of Congolese soldiers against the continued rule of Belgian officers in the Congolese army is still ongoing. The soldiers are demanding the removal of all Belgian officers from the Congolese army.

On the night of July 7th, Congolese soldiers at the Leopold Barracks near Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, took control of the barracks' weapons and drove out the European colonial officers who ruled them. On the 8th, Congolese soldiers at the Randolph Barracks also joined the ranks of the struggle against Belgian colonialists, occupying the armory there, which had always been controlled by Belgian officers.

It is reported that angry Congolese soldiers are patrolling the streets of Leopoldville with weapons, stopping colonialist vehicles, searching for colonialist weapons, and controlling telecommunications between Leopoldville and Brussels.

On the 8th, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba announced that the Congolese government had reached an agreement with representatives of the Congolese soldiers: in the future, all Congolese army officers will be Congolese, and Belgians will only serve as technical "advisers." It is reported that Congolese President Kasavubu has served as Commander-in-Chief of the Congolese Army since the 8th, replacing Belgian General Janssens, who was forced to "resign."

Sources say that Congolese residents in Leopoldville have also risen up against Belgian colonialists remaining in the Lower Congo region, seeking to drive them out of the area. Amidst the wave of anti-colonialism by Congolese soldiers and residents, the colonialists are terrified and fleeing across the Congo River to French Central Congo. It is reported that by the morning of the 8th, approximately three thousand European colonialists had fled there, some still carrying weapons.

The struggle of the Congolese people has alarmed the Belgian authorities. According to reports from Brussels, the Belgian government convened an emergency meeting on the morning of the 8th to plot new interventionist conspiracies. Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens announced after the emergency cabinet meeting that the Belgian government had decided to withdraw two companies of infantry from West Germany and airlift them to the Congo that day to strengthen the strength of the Belgian troops stationed in the Congo. It is also reported that the Conakat party, representing the interests of Belgian monopoly capital in Katanga Province, has been in talks with the former Belgian Governor of Elisabethville, plotting to secede Katanga Province from the Republic of the Congo.

    刚果士兵要求撤换所有比籍军官
    比利时政府惊惶不安调兵遣将阴谋干涉
    新华社9日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果士兵掀起的反对比利时军官继续统治刚果军队的斗争仍在进行。士兵们要求撤换刚果军队中的所有比籍军官。
    7日午夜，刚果首都利奥波德维尔附近的利奥波德兵营的刚果士兵接管了这个兵营的武器，并且赶走了统治他们的欧洲殖民军官。8日，伦道夫军营的刚果士兵也参加了反对比利时殖民者的斗争行列，占领了那里一直为比籍军官所控制的军火库。
    据报道，愤怒的刚果士兵拿着武器在利奥波德维尔街道上巡逻、阻拦殖民者的车辆、搜查殖民者的武器，并控制了利奥波德维尔同布鲁塞尔的电讯联系。
    8日，刚果总理卢蒙巴曾经宣布，刚果政府已经同刚果士兵的代表团达成了协议：将来所有刚果陆军军官都将是刚果人，比利时人将只担任技术“顾问”。据报道，刚果共和国总统卡萨武布8日起担任了刚果陆军总司令以接替被迫“辞职”的比利时将军让桑的职务。
    有消息说，利奥波德维尔的刚果居民也起来反对留在下刚果地区的比利时殖民者，要把他们赶出这个地区。在刚果士兵和居民的反殖民主义的浪潮中，殖民者惊恐万分，纷纷逃向刚果河对岸的法属中央刚果。据报道，到8日上午，约有三千名欧洲殖民者逃往那里，有一些殖民者手中还拿着武器。
    刚果人民的斗争使比利时当局惊惶不安，据来自布鲁塞尔的消息说，比利时政府8日上午召开紧急会议策划新的干涉阴谋。比利时首相伊斯更斯在内阁紧急会议后宣布，比利时政府决定从西德抽调两连步兵，当天空运刚果，以加强驻在刚果的比利时军队的实力。另据报道，刚果加丹加省代表比利时垄断资本利益的科纳卡特党曾同驻在伊利沙伯维尔的前比利时省督商谈，阴谋使加丹加省从刚果共和国分裂出去。
