Unified Leadership and Organic Integration Better Support Agriculture
Baodi County Party Committee's Regular "National Economic Report Meeting" Achieves Great Results

    According to a report from the *Hebei Daily*, the Baodi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in organizing the mass movement of all sectors to support agriculture, used the method of the "National Economic Report Meeting" to promote comprehensive support for agricultural production from industry, transportation, finance, trade, science, and education departments.

    The "National Economic Report Meeting" is convened regularly by the Party committee, bringing together various sectors of the national economy to report on their situations, raise issues, study measures, unify planning arrangements, and coordinate actions around the Party's central tasks. Over the past two months, the county committee has regularly convened the "National Economic Report Meeting," achieving significant results in organizing all sectors to support agriculture.

    The "National Economic Report Meeting" facilitates the comprehensive and organic integration of the work of various departments in supporting agricultural production. For example, during an early drought-fighting report meeting, it was discovered that the industrial sector's small farm implement production plan and the commercial sector's inventory of small farm implements were far from meeting the needs of agricultural production; and the varieties of grain seeds stored by the grain department in different regions were very unbalanced compared to the actual needs. After these contradictions were presented, the industrial sector immediately readjusted its small farm implement production plan, with Baodi Machinery Factory alone contracting to produce 32,000 small farm implements. In addition to expediting the transportation of seeds and agricultural technology transformation materials, the transportation department also transported over 1.8 million *jin* of seeds from other areas, ensuring timely sowing. The commercial department took responsibility for the supply of production materials, delivering one piece to the production team for every piece produced by the industrial sector. To support the funds needed by the industrial and commercial sectors, the finance and banking departments promptly issued loans to factories and shops, while also helping industrial and commercial departments and commune production teams make good arrangements for funds.

    The "National Economic Report Meeting" is also an educational meeting. By presenting the situation, highlighting tasks, and criticizing decentralism, it continuously enhances the thinking of cadres in all sectors about taking agriculture as the foundation. For example, the industrial sector for a period of time only focused on grabbing output value, neglecting the needs of agricultural production, and failed to supply summer harvesting and planting tools in a timely manner. At the "National Economic Report Meeting," the industrial sector made a self-criticism and swiftly assigned the production tasks of summer harvesting and planting tools to specific factories and workshops, and to specific individuals. After a half-month of intensive effort, all tasks were completed. As another example, the county-run twenty-seven factories had planned to expand from 1,600 workers to 2,380 workers. At the "National Economic Report Meeting," the county committee presented the current labor shortage on the agricultural front, making the industrial sector realize that supporting agriculture first requires not competing with agriculture for labor, but rather carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to increase labor efficiency.

    The "National Economic Report Meeting" also strengthened the relationship between various departments, resulting in a vivid situation of "one party having difficulties, many parties providing support." In May, the county's more than 720 irrigation and drainage machines and hundreds of waterwheels urgently needed matching parts and repairs, and the industrial system had difficulty undertaking this task. After this issue was raised at the "Report Meeting," the relevant industries proactively included supporting the industrial sector in carrying out repairs and matching parts in their own work plans. The commercial department launched a warehouse clearance movement, finding 14,000 machine and waterwheel parts and sending them to the industrial sector and production teams. Other departments also cooperated effectively, quickly completing the repair and matching of parts for more than 600 machines and more than 56,000 water-lifting tools.

    Through the "National Economic Report Meeting," Baodi County effectively organized the strength of all sectors, promoting a continued great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the county. The county experienced a severe drought for 200 days, yet the yield per *mu* of more than 600,000 *mu* of wheat increased compared to 1959; during the drought, more than 600 mechanized wells and more than 5,000 brick and earth wells were repaired and dug, and more than 10 million cubic meters of surface water conservancy projects were completed, more than three times the total amount for the entire year of 1959; the number of irrigation and drainage machines increased from 350 to 920. Currently, the sowing of more than 1.1 million *mu* of field crops throughout the county has been completed, and seedlings are generally growing well.

    统一领导有机结合更好支援农业
    宝坻县委定期召开“国民经济汇报会”收到巨大效果
    据河北日报消息　中共河北宝坻县委在组织各行各业支援农业的群众运动中，运用“国民经济汇报会”的方法，促使工业、交通、财政、贸易、科学、教育等部门全面地支援农业生产。
    “国民经济汇报会”是由党委定期地召集国民经济各个部门，围绕着党的中心工作汇报情况，提出问题，研究措施，统一安排计划，统一组织行动。两个多月来，县委定期地召开了“国民经济汇报会”，在组织各行各业支援农业方面取得了显著成效。
    “国民经济汇报会”便于把各个部门支援农业生产的工作全面地有机结合起来。例如抗旱初期的一次汇报会，发现工业部门的小农具生产计划和商业部门库存的小农具远不能满足农业生产需要；粮食部门保管的粮种地区间储存的品种和需要量很不平衡。这些矛盾摆出以后，工业部门立即对小农具生产重新做了安排，仅宝坻机械厂就包制小农具三万二千件；交通部门除了对种籽和农业技术改造物资提前运输以外，还从外地调运种子一百八十多万斤，保证了适时播种。商业部门把生产资料供应工作包起来了，工业部门生产出一件，他们就送到生产队一件。财政、银行部门为了支持工业和商业部门所需资金，把贷款及时发放到工厂、商店，同时帮助工商部门和公社生产队做好资金安排。
    “国民经济汇报会”也是教育会，通过摆形势，亮任务，批判分散主义，不断地提高了各行各业干部以农业为基础的思想。例如工业部门有一段时间只注意抓产值，忽视抓农业生产需要，不能及时供应夏收夏种工具。在“国民经济汇报会”上，工业部门作了检查批判，迅速把夏收夏种工具的生产任务核定到厂、到车间，落实到人。经过半个月的大突击，全部完成了任务。又如县营的二十七个工厂曾计划由一千六百人发展到二千三百八十人。在“国民经济汇报会”上，县委摆出了当前农业战线劳力不足的情况，使工业部门认识到支援农业首先要不和农业争夺劳力，而是需要开展技术革新和技术革命运动，提高工效。
    “国民经济汇报会”还密切了各个部门间的关系，出现了“一方有困难，多方来支援”的生动局面。5月间，全县的七百二十多台排灌机械和几百架水车急需配套和修理，工业系统承担这个任务有困难。在“汇报会”上提出这个问题之后，有关行业都主动地把支援工业搞修配列入了自己的工作计划。商业部门开展了清仓清库运动，找出一万四千件机械、水车零件，送给工业部门和生产队。其他部门也有力配合，很快完成了六百多台机器和五万六千多件提水工具的修配任务。
    宝坻县通过“国民经济汇报会”有效地将各行各业的力量组织起来，促使全县农业生产出现了继续跃进的大好形势。全县大旱二百天，六十多万亩小麦亩产量比1959年增加；在大旱中修整和打成机井六百多眼，砖、土井五千多眼，地上水利工程一千多万方，比1959年全年还多三倍；排灌机械由三百五十台增到九百二十台。现在，全县一百一十多万亩大田作物都完成了播种，禾苗一般生长良好。
