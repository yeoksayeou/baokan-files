Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, issued an appeal to the Japanese people at a press conference today, calling on them to struggle for the victory of the Sixth World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

    Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Sudan, Mexico, and other countries who have arrived in Tokyo attended the press conference.

    The appeal stated: The Sixth World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament will open in three days. We sincerely thank the world and Japan for their strong support for this congress.

    The appeal stated: The number of foreign representatives coming to participate in the World Congress this year far exceeds that of the Fifth World Congress last year. They come from all continents of the world. The Chinese delegation is coming to participate in the congress for the first time in three years, which is truly worthy of rejoicing.

    The great expectations and trust placed in the Sixth World Congress are due to the high evaluation by the people of all countries of the achievements made by the Japanese people in the movement to ban nuclear weapons, oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and strive for democracy.

    We should enable the Sixth World Congress to absorb the strength accumulated by the Japanese people in these movements and further develop this strength. At the same time, we must combine the congress with various peace movements and national independence movements around the world in order to gather a huge force for peace.

    The appeal emphasized: We must use this force for peace to overwhelm the forces carrying out cold war policies and militarist policies, and pave the way for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and complete disarmament, as well as peaceful coexistence. This is the basic task of the Sixth World Congress. Therefore, it can be said that this year's congress is a "congress of struggle."

    Japan's anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement is a national movement involving broad strata, standing on a humanitarian position and aiming to prevent the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from being repeated on the people of any country in the world. However, in the current situation, this movement must wage a resolute struggle against the enemies of peace. This does not mean abandoning the humanitarian position; on the contrary, only by fighting against the enemies of peace can we uphold the humanitarian position.

    Of course, the movement against cold war policies and militarist policies is not hostile to the people of any particular country. The Japanese people's movement against the "Security Treaty" is not a movement hostile to the American people; on the contrary, it is a movement carried out by the people of all countries, including the American people, for their common interests. This correct understanding is being accepted by the American people. We have always joined hands with American friends of peace to carry out joint actions in the past, and we must further strengthen solidarity and cooperation in this year's World Congress.

    The appeal stated: If the representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, as well as all countries around the world, attending the Sixth World Congress can reach a consensus with all the Japanese representatives and formulate firm guidelines for joint action, this will make a great contribution to world peace.

    The appeal stated: The people of all countries are watching the Sixth World Congress. We sincerely call on all Japanese people not to disappoint the expectations and trust of the people of all countries, and to carry out a strong struggle for the glorious victory of the Sixth World Congress.

    Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, made a statement after Yasui Kaoru read the appeal, saying: The Chinese delegation wholeheartedly supports the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against nuclear weapons, against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," against the revival of militarism, and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, and congratulates Japanese friends on the great achievements they have achieved in these struggles. He said that the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality is not only related to the interests of the broad masses of the Japanese people, but also to the interests of the peace-loving people of the world. Therefore, this struggle has won the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the support of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for national independence and democracy.

    Liu Ningyi pointed out that the people of the world are opposing the imperialist war policy and aggression policy headed by the United States. The people of Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Algeria, Congo, and Cuba are all engaged in heroic struggles against their common enemies. He pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people and the struggle of the people of the world support each other.

    Liu Ningyi finally said that, as Mr. Yasui Kaoru said, the Sixth World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament is a congress for the joint struggle of the Japanese people and the people of the world. He believes that this congress will be a congress of struggle, a congress of unity, and a congress of victory.

    Soviet representative Bulgakov, American representative Kelly, Mexican representative General Hara, Sudanese representative Hel, Australian representative Hook, West German representative Kurt Bewersdorff, and Zheng Shenyu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, spoke at the press conference.

    安井郁为举行禁止原子弹氢弹大会呼吁日本人民
    必须同和平的敌人进行坚决的斗争
    刘宁一祝贺日本人民爱国正义斗争的巨大成就
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天在记者招待会上向日本人民发表了呼吁书，呼吁日本人民为争取胜利举行第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会而斗争。
    已经到达东京的苏联、中国、美国、苏丹、墨西哥等国家的代表出席了记者招待会。
    呼吁书说：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会即将在三天后开幕。我们衷心感谢全世界和日本全国对这个大会给予强有力的支持。
    呼吁书说：今年前来参加世界大会的外国代表人数远远超过了去年的第五届世界大会，他们来自全世界所有的大陆。中国代表三年来第一次前来参加大会，实在是值得欢欣的。
    对于第六届世界大会寄予这么大的期待和信任，这是由于日本人民在禁止核武器、反对日美“安全条约”以及争取民主的运动中所取得的成就得到世界各国人民很高的评价。
    我们应该使第六届世界大会吸取日本人民在这些运动中所储备的力量，并且进一步发挥这种力量。同时，要使大会同全世界各种各样的和平运动和民族独立运动结合起来，以便汇集成巨大的和平力量。
    呼吁书强调说：我们要以这种和平力量压倒进行冷战政策和军国主义政策的势力，并为争取禁止原子弹氢弹和完全裁军以及和平共处开辟道路。这是第六届世界大会的基本任务。因此可以说，今年的大会是“斗争的世界大会”。
    日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动是站在人道主义立场、目的在于不许在全世界任何国家人民身上重演广岛和长崎的悲剧的包括广泛阶层参加的国民运动。然而，在目前形势下，这个运动必须同和平的敌人进行坚决斗争。这不意味着抛弃人道主义立场，相反，只有通过同和平的敌人进行斗争才能坚持人道主义立场。
    当然，反对进行冷战政策和军国主义政策的运动并不是敌对某一个特定的国家的人民。日本人民反对“安全条约”的运动也不是敌对美国人民的运动，相反地这是包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民为了共同的利益而进行的运动。这种正确理解正在为美国人民所接受。我们过去一向同美国的和平朋友携手展开共同行动，在今年的世界大会中也要更进一步加强团结和合作。
    呼吁书说：出席第六届世界大会的美国、苏联和中国以及全世界各国代表如果能够同全体日本代表取得一致意见，制订坚决的共同活动方针，这样对于世界和平将会作出巨大贡献。
    呼吁书说：世界各国人民正在注视着第六届世界大会。我们衷心地呼吁全体日本人民不要辜负世界各国人民的期待和信任，为争取第六届世界大会的辉煌胜利而进行强有力的斗争。
    中国代表团团长刘宁一在安井郁宣读呼吁书后发表谈话说：中国代表团衷心支持日本人民反对核武器、反对日美“安全条约”、反对复活军国主义、要求撤销美军基地的爱国正义斗争，并且祝贺日本朋友在这些斗争中所获得的巨大成就。他说，日本人民要求和平、独立、民主、中立的斗争，不仅关系着日本广大人民的利益，也关系着爱好和平的世界人民的利益。因此，这一斗争获得了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持，获得了争取民族独立和民主的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的支持。
    刘宁一指出，全世界人民都在反对以美国为首的帝国主义战争政策和侵略政策，日本、南朝鲜、土耳其、阿尔及利亚、刚果、古巴的人民都在为反对它们的共同敌人而进行着英勇的斗争。他指出，日本人民的斗争和全世界人民的斗争是互相支持的。
    刘宁一最后说，正如安井郁先生所说，第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，是日本人民和全世界人民共同进行斗争的大会。他相信这次大会是个斗争的大会、团结的大会和胜利的大会。
    苏联代表布尔加科夫、美国代表凯利、墨西哥代表哈拉将军、苏丹代表赫尔、澳大利亚代表胡克、西德代表库尔特·贝韦斯道夫以及世界和平理事会书记处书记郑森禹在记者招待会上讲了话。
