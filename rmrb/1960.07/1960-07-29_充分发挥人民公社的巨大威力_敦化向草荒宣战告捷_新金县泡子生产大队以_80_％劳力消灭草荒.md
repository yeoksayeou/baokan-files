Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 27th: The people's communes in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, have demonstrated tremendous power in eliminating the scourge of weed infestation. More than 63,000 hectares of farmland throughout the county have been universally hoed and weeded three times, with more than half of it hoed and weeded four times. After hoeing and weeding, the fields are full of strong seedlings, and various crops have thick stalks and lush leaves. Now, on the basis of basically eliminating weed infestation, the communes are riding the wave to launch a "Five Drives" field management campaign, which includes converting newly reclaimed land to catch up with cultivated land, mountainous land to catch up with flat land, ordinary fields to catch up with high-yield fields, low-yield crops to catch up with high-yield crops, and second- and third-class seedlings to catch up with first-class seedlings.

Dunhua County has vast barren mountains and grasslands. The cultivated land, which accounts for about 6% of the land area, is almost entirely adjacent to wilderness, and various weeds and seeds are constantly spreading to the farmland. Therefore, for a long time, weeds in the fields have plagued crops like floods, droughts, and insects. In 1957, weed infestation was relatively serious here. Although the people of the county tried their best to rescue the crops, more than 1,200 hectares of farmland still yielded no harvest due to weed damage. This year, due to frequent rainfall, weed infestation is even more rampant than in recent years. During the seedling germination period, weeds were generally more numerous and taller than seedlings in the fields. Weed infestation was even more serious in newly reclaimed land and hillside land, which account for about 20% of the cultivated land area, with the masses describing it as "dropping a steamed bun and it wouldn't even touch the soil." At that time, when the communes studied the elimination of weed infestation, they felt that there was insufficient labor based on the existing labor force in agriculture. The county was short 640,000 workdays in total. If the labor shortage could not be solved, the hoeing and weeding time would have to be prolonged, affecting the growth of seedlings. However, this difficulty was finally overcome under the leadership of the Party, relying on the superiority of the people's communes' large size and high degree of public ownership.

The people's communes' unified mobilization of manpower from all sides, based on the importance and urgency of the situation, to strengthen the main battle line is an important factor in Dunhua County's ability to overcome weed infestation. At the beginning of the battle to eliminate weeds, the people's communes uniformly arranged the labor force from all walks of life, such as industry and commerce, and transferred troops and generals from all directions to participate in the weeding battle. The communes also generally streamlined logistics departments, using weaker personnel in place of stronger ones, and women in place of men, to enhance the strength of the agricultural front line. Through these measures, the labor force participating in hoeing and weeding throughout the county increased by more than 14,000, and these people contributed more than 500,000 workdays during summer hoeing, effectively accelerating the progress of hoeing and weeding.

Commune-run industries played an important role in supplying improved cultivation tools and ensuring the timely elimination of weed infestation. Before the start of summer hoeing, the communes selected more than 400 skilled craftsmen to form more than 100 tool reform groups to create and modify semi-mechanized cultivation and weeding tools. The county's 16 commune-run farm implement factories and 71 management district-run farm implement repair shops (groups) were responsible for manufacturing. In a relatively short period of time, they manufactured more than 18,000 pieces of equipment. Together with the original semi-mechanized tools, the level of semi-mechanization in cultivation and weeding operations throughout the county reached more than 50%. The use of these new tools saved a total of more than 200,000 workdays, which was equivalent to increasing the labor force by more than 5,000 during the summer hoeing period.

Based on the principles of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange, the people's communes organized communist-style large-scale cooperation, with the advanced helping the backward, to ensure the balanced development of weed elimination progress. More than 80% of the management districts and production teams throughout the county engaged in large-scale cooperation, with the broad masses of commune members stepping forward when they saw difficulties and helping those who lagged behind. The Shaheyan People's Commune organized a shock brigade of more than 300 people and went to three backward teams to work together vigorously. After five days of hard work, they rescued all the 130-plus hectares of barren farmland in these three teams. The Yangmulin and Xiwazi advanced production teams of the Guandi Commune, upon hearing that the summer hoeing progress of the Gangzi Production Team was slow, jointly dispatched more than 200 people to rush to help the Gangzi Production Team members for three days, weeding more than 100 hectares of weed-infested land and enabling the production team to complete the third round of hoeing and weeding tasks six days ahead of schedule.

During the entire summer hoeing period, 90% of the county and commune cadres fought on the front lines. They labored and consulted with the broad masses of commune members, skillfully arranging agricultural work. Ten thousand hectares of farmland throughout the county implemented hoeing for "emerging weeds" (weeding before seedlings emerge from the soil), and 80% of the farmland implemented plowing before hoeing. In order to seize time from the rainy days, commune members implemented methods such as hoeing newly reclaimed land and hillside land on rainy days and hoeing low-lying land on sunny days; hoeing paddy fields on rainy days and hoeing dry land on sunny days, rescuing weed-infested land without being deterred by wind or rain. About 30% of the farmland in the county was hoed in the rain. This bought time for timely hoeing and weeding, and for more hoeing and weeding, and timely rescued weed-infested land.

This newspaper reports: The Paozi Production Brigade of the Pulandian People's Commune in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, concentrated more than 80% of its labor force to declare war on weed infestation, seizing grain from pests, and winning successive victories. At present, the brigade's 14,000 mu of large fields have generally been hoed and weeded twice, and the serious weed infestation and insect pests have been basically eliminated.

At the beginning of this year's summer hoeing, the brigade's labor force was relatively dispersed. By early June, only 30% of the land had been hoed and weeded for the first time, with 2,600 mu seriously infested with weeds and more than 800 mu suffering from insect pests. The brigade's Party general branch organized the masses to discuss the situation, which quickly increased the number of laborers engaged in field production in the entire brigade from 840 to more than 1,200, reaching more than 80% of the total labor force.

In order to improve labor efficiency and accelerate production progress, the Paozi Brigade also promoted the establishment of four systems in each team: First, planned assignment of work, with a small short-term plan formulated democratically every five days, so that commune members know what to do early; second, implementation of a team collective responsibility system, dividing areas, fixing work groups, and contracting the work to the end; third, reasonable calculation of remuneration, with complete jobs contracted to teams, fixed quotas, and incomplete jobs contracted to individuals, with piece-rate accounting; fourth, implementation of a quality acceptance system.

    充分发挥人民公社的巨大威力
    敦化向草荒宣战告捷 
    新金县泡子生产大队以80％劳力消灭草荒
    新华社长春27日电　吉林省敦化县各人民公社在消灭草荒为害中，显示了巨大威力。全县六万三千多公顷农田，普遍做到了三铲三趟，有一半以上铲趟了四遍；经过铲趟的农田，块块苗全苗壮，各种作物秆粗叶茂。现在，各公社在基本消灭草荒的基础上，正乘胜掀起一个以新垦地赶熟耕地、山地赶平地、一般田赶高产田、低产作物赶高产作物、二三类苗赶一类苗为内容的“五赶”田间管理运动。
    敦化县荒山草地辽阔，占土地面积6％左右的耕地，几乎片片都与荒原毗连，各种杂草草籽不断向农田传播。因此长久以来田间杂草像水、旱、虫等灾害一样为害作物。1957年这里草荒较为严重，虽经全县人民竭力抢救，但仍有一千二百多公顷农田因草害颗粒无收。今年，由于雨水频多，草荒更猖獗到几年来罕见的程度。在禾苗萌芽时期，一般农田都是草比苗多，草比苗高。占耕地面积20％左右的新垦地和山坡地，草荒更为严重，群众形容说：“扔上饽饽都不沾土”。当时，各公社在研究消灭草荒时，按农业上现有劳力计算，要在规定的时间内完成铲趟，都感劳力不足，全县共缺六十四万个工，如果不能解决劳力不足问题，就要拖长铲趟时间，影响禾苗生长。但是，这个困难，在党的领导下，依靠人民公社一大二公的优越性，终于战胜了。
    人民公社根据轻重缓急，统一调动各方面的人力，加强主攻战线，这是敦化县能够战胜草荒的重要因素。锄草灭荒战斗一开始，各人民公社就统一安排工业、商业等各行各业的劳力，从四面八方调兵遣将，投入锄草战斗。各公社还普遍精简后勤部门，以弱代强，以女代男，增强农业第一线的力量。通过这些措施，全县参加铲趟的劳力，增加了一万四千多个，这些人在夏锄中共做了五十多万个工，有效的加快了铲趟的进度。
    社办工业在供应改良的中耕工具，保证及时消灭草荒上起了重要作用。夏锄开始前，各公社即选拔四百多名能工巧将，组成百余个工具改革小组，创制和改制半机械化的中耕除草工具；全县十六个社办农具厂和七十一个管理区办的农具修配厂（组）负责制造，在较短的时间内，就制造出一万八千多件，加上原有的半机械化工具，全县中耕除草作业半机械化程度达50％以上。使用这些新工具，全县共节省了二十多万个工，在夏锄期间等于增加五千多个劳动力。
    各人民公社根据互助互利等价交换的原则，组织共产主义大协作，以先进帮后进，保证了锄草灭荒进度平衡发展。全县80％多的管理区和生产队都搞了大协作，广大社员见困难就上，见后进就帮。沙河沿人民公社组织了三百多人的突击队，分别到三个后进队，通力协作，奋战五天，把这三个队一百三十多公顷荒芜的农田全部抢救出来。官地公社杨木林和西崴子等先进生产队，听说岗子生产队夏锄进度迟缓，他们就联合出动二百多人，同岗子生产队社员一起突击三天，铲完了一百多公顷草荒地，使这个生产队提前六天完成第三遍铲趟任务。
    在整个夏锄期间，全县90％县、社干部都奋战在最前线。他们和广大社员同劳动同商量，巧妙安排农活。全县有一万公顷农田实行了铲“萌生”（禾苗未出土就锄草），有80％的农田实行铲前趟一犁。为了同雨天争时间，社员实行雨天铲新垦地和岗地，晴天铲低洼地；雨天锄水田，晴天铲旱田等办法，风雨不误地抢救草荒地。全县有30％左右的农田是冒雨铲出的。这样，为及时铲趟和多铲多趟赢得了时间，及时地抢救了草荒地。
    本报讯　辽宁省新金县普兰店人民公社泡子生产大队，集中80％以上的劳动力向草荒宣战，从虫口夺粮，连战连捷。目前，全队一万四千亩大田已经普遍铲趟两遍，严重的草荒、虫害已经基本消灭。
    今年夏锄开始时，这个大队劳动力使用比较分散，到6月上旬只有30％土地铲完头遍，有二千六百亩草荒严重，八百多亩发生虫害。大队党总支根据这种情况组织群众讨论，很快就使全大队投入田间生产的劳动力由八百四十人增加到一千二百多人，达到总劳动力80％以上。
    为了提高劳动效率，加速生产进度，泡子大队还推动各小队普遍建立了四项制度：第一，计划派活，每五天民主制订一次小段计划，使社员干活早知道；第二，实行小组集体责任制，划分区域，固定作业组，一包到底；第三，合理计算报酬，成套活计实行小组包工，定额落实，不成套的实行个人包工，定额计件；第四，执行质量验收制度。
