Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Herter directly requested that the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, on the 27th, passed a recommendation granting the U.S. President the power to reduce Cuba's share of the U.S. sugar market. This recommendation will be submitted to the full House of Representatives for discussion.

In coordination with the economic pressure on Cuba, the U.S. submitted a memorandum to a closed session of the Organization of American States' Inter-American Peace Committee on the 27th, "accusing" Cuba of taking so-called "provocative actions" against the United States.

In this memorandum, the U.S. government, disregarding its consistently reckless acts of aggression and sabotage against Cuba, instead falsely accused Cuba's legitimate accusations of these bandit-like actions against the U.S. as "systematic, provocative slander and hostile propaganda activities" against the U.S., and insisted that this "is the root cause of the tension in this hemisphere." In order to create a pretext for further interference in Cuba, the U.S. government also attacked Cuba's legitimate accusations in the memorandum, claiming that they "cannot but intensify the tension in the Caribbean region" and "undermine" the "cooperative relationship that members of the Organization of American States are obligated to maintain." According to Washington officials, this U.S. memorandum will be provided to the Inter-American Peace Committee for "reference" when "discussing the tension in the Caribbean region." This committee is a tool that the U.S. has been plotting to use to further interfere in Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch from Washington: Wall Street monopoly groups are once again openly clamoring for armed intervention in Cuba.

U.S. Representative L. Mendel Rivers, a Democrat from South Carolina, said during a House debate on U.S.-Cuba "relations" on the 25th that the U.S. government should issue an ultimatum to Castro so that the U.S. can take "appropriate measures" including a blockade and occupation of Cuba. In his speech, Rivers wildly slandered Cuban Prime Minister Castro and threatened that "we must use everything at our disposal to punish this evil figure."

At the same meeting, Republican Congressman Frank T. Bow also demanded that the U.S. government send Marines to carry out an armed occupation of Cuba. Another Congressman, Daniel Flood, shamelessly said that he did not believe there was a "real Cuban government" in Cuba.

The day before the above-mentioned U.S. congressmen issued their calls for armed aggression, U.S. Secretary of State Herter openly admitted at a press conference in Washington that the Inter-American Peace Committee, under U.S. control, had been "studying" the situation in the Caribbean region since the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas was held in Santiago, Chile, last August. Herter said, "That committee has been collecting information. We have provided some information to that committee," and "will provide it with more information in the near future."

    美国干涉古巴阴谋双管齐下
    众院农委会授权总统削减古巴食糖进口额
    一批议员叫嚷要派遣海军陆战队占领古巴
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国国务卿赫脱直接要求下，美国众议院农业委员会27日通过了授予美国总统以削减古巴在美国市场上的食糖份额的权力的建议。这项建议将提交众议院全体会议讨论。
    与对古巴施加经济压力相配合，美国在27日向美洲国家组织泛美和平委员会的一次秘密会议提交了一项“指责”古巴对美国采取所谓“挑衅行动”的备忘录。
    美国政府在这项备忘录中不顾它一贯肆无忌惮地对古巴进行侵略和破坏活动的事实，反而诬指古巴就美国的这些强盗行径提出的正当指责是对美国的“有系统的、挑衅性的诬蔑和敌视宣传活动”，并且硬说这“是造成这个半球的紧张局势的根源”。为了制造进一步干涉古巴的借口，美国政府在备忘录中还攻击古巴的正当指责将“不能不加剧加勒比海地区的紧张局势”，并“破坏”“美洲国家组织成员国有义务加以维持的（泛美）合作关系”。据华盛顿官员们透露，美国的这项备忘录将供泛美和平委员会在“讨论加勒比海地区的紧张局势时”“参考”。这个委员会是美国一直在策划用来进一步干涉古巴的工具。
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：华尔街垄断集团的谋士们又公然叫嚣对古巴进行武装干涉。
    美国众议员南卡罗来纳州民主党人勒·曼德尔·李维斯25日在众议院辩论古美“关系”时说，美国政府应该向卡斯特罗发出一项最后通牒，以便美国采取包括封锁和占领古巴的“适当的措施”。李维斯在他的演说中疯狂地污蔑古巴总理卡斯特罗，并且威胁说，“我们必须使用我们所能支配的一切来制裁这个邪恶的人物”。
    在同一次会议上，共和党议员弗兰克·特·鲍也要求美国政府派遣海军陆战队实行武装占领古巴。还有一个众议员丹尼尔·弗勒德厚颜无耻地说，他认为在古巴不存在“真正的古巴政府”。
    在上述美国议员发出武装进攻叫嚣的前一天，美国国务卿赫脱在华盛顿的记者招待会上公开承认，自从去年8月间在智利圣地亚哥召开美洲外长会议以来，美国控制下的美洲国家和平委员会一直在“研究”加勒比海地区局势。赫脱说，“那个委员会一直在收集情况。我们已经向那个委员会提供了一些情况”，并且“在不久的将来将向它提供更多的情况”。
