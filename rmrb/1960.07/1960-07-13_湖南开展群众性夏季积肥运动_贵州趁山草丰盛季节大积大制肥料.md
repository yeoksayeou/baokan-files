Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 12th: Hunan Province has adopted various manure collection measures and launched a large-scale mass summer manure collection campaign throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to work hard for ten to fifteen days to collect and produce various mixed fertilizers for spring and summer crops and late rice and autumn-sown coarse grains. From the district, county, and commune levels down to the brigade level, there should be dedicated cadres to lead the entire process of manure collection, fertilizer production, fertilizer preservation, and rational fertilization.

At present, intermediate rice, single-season late rice, and dryland crops in Hunan Province are in a period of vigorous growth. Grasping topdressing and cultivation is an important guarantee for achieving large-area balanced yield increases. At the same time, the province's planting area for double-season late rice and autumn-sown coarse grains is larger than in previous years, requiring more base fertilizer. To this end, all localities have actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and launched a vigorous manure collection campaign in conjunction with the late-stage field management of early rice.

Establishing professional manure collection teams, vigorously developing basic manure collection construction, and promoting the specialization and regularization of manure collection are prominent features of Hunan Province's summer manure collection. In Hengyang Prefecture, more than 90% of the production teams have fixed labor to form year-round professional manure collection teams. Each work group has two or three kilns that constantly burn soil ash, and the fields have year-round fertilizer storage pits for composting, so that manure is collected at ordinary times and used when needed, with the kiln constantly burning and the pit constantly filled with fertilizer. Some places have universally promoted methods such as having cattle herders also cut green manure, water managers collect wild manure, vegetable growers shovel sod, and canteen service personnel collect ash fertilizer, establishing a year-round manure collection system by combining hygiene with household manure collection.

All localities are also taking advantage of the favorable conditions of lush mountains, abundant lake grass, rich fertilizer sources, and high temperatures and rapid decomposition in summer to combine professional manure collection with shock manure collection. In Liuyang County, 150,000 people were mobilized to dig pits along the edges of more than 300,000 mu of fields to compost fertilizer.

In the past, most localities sowed green manure in winter. This year, Hengyang Prefecture summarized the experience of Ningyuan County that summer-sown green manure grows quickly, has high yields, and saves labor. The entire district used idle land along fields, ponds, and rivers to plant more than 610,000 mu of summer green manure, preparing sufficient fertilizer for late rice and saving a large amount of manure collection labor. All localities in the province have also universally promoted summer planting of green manure based on local conditions.

Vigorously developing pig and cattle raising to collect manure is also a major aspect of the summer manure collection campaign. Pig farms throughout the province are established according to the distribution plans of farmland. Since the beginning of summer, all localities have cut green manure and used it for bedding in pigsties and cowsheds to produce fertilizer, in accordance with the mass summer practice of cutting green manure for bedding. While collecting manure, all localities have further developed the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 12th: People's communes in Guizhou Province are seizing the summer season of abundant mountain grass to vigorously collect and produce enough fertilizer for autumn crops.

In order to win a bumper harvest of autumn crops, people's communes in various places have meticulously arranged manure collection work in field management. People's communes in Bijie Prefecture organized members to visit advanced manure collection areas and promptly promoted advanced experiences in manure collection and fertilizer production. The CPC Weining County Committee promoted the experience of the Gaoyuan Management District of Longjie Commune in adhering to the "three combinations" of professional and mass, regular and shock, and manure collection and sanitation. The amount of fertilizer collected and produced in the county in June greatly exceeded the amount of fertilizer collected in the same period last year. Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Tongren Prefecture have arranged about 10% of the labor force to go to the mountains to cut green grass and make soaked green fertilizer and high-temperature compost fertilizer after the basic completion of the rush harvest and rush planting. Some areas have also adopted methods such as building pens on the mountains, having plowing cattle go to the mountains, and cutting grass for manure collection on the spot, so that summer manure collection can be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

Simultaneously collecting and producing natural fertilizer and manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizer is a characteristic of Guizhou's summer manure collection. Guiding County, while vigorously collecting and producing natural fertilizer, established more than 600 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants and manufactured more than 350,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer. Many areas also manufacture fertilizers according to the characteristics of local soil. Duyun City has more acidic soil, so it manufactures alkaline indigenous chemical fertilizer on a large scale. In Zhenyuan County, soil fertilizer is manufactured from the county and commune levels down to the management district and production team levels, providing a large amount of fertilizer for mid-season cultivation and topdressing.

In Linru County, Henan, the pig raising industry is developing at a high speed. In more than ten months, a total of more than 4 billion jin of high-quality pig manure has been collected, averaging 4,000 jin per mu. This is a large batch of pig manure from the Chenglou Pig Farm of the Chengguan Commune being sent to the autumn fields. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhenyan.

### 湖南开展群众性夏季积肥运动　贵州趁山草丰盛季节大积大制肥料

　　湖南开展群众性夏季积肥运动
　　贵州趁山草丰盛季节大积大制肥料
    据新华社长沙12日电　湖南省采取多种积肥措施，在全省范围内展开了大规模的群众性夏季积肥运动。省委要求各地大干十天半月，为春夏播作物和晚稻、秋播杂粮积制各种混合肥料；从地、县、社到大队都应有专职干部，领导积肥、制肥、保肥、合理施肥等一整套工作。
    湖南省目前中稻、一季晚稻和旱地作物正处在生长旺盛时期，抓紧追肥中耕，是实现大面积平衡增产的重要保证。同时，全省今年双季晚稻和秋种杂粮作物的播种面积比往年大，需要更多的基肥。为此，各地积极地响应了省委号召，结合早稻后期田间管理，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的积肥运动。
    建立专业的积肥队伍，大搞积肥的基本建设，把积肥推向专业化、经常化，是湖南省夏季积肥的显著特点。衡阳专区90％以上的生产队都固定劳力组成常年专业积肥队，每个作业组都有两三个常年烧火土灰的窑，田间有常年沤肥的肥库，做到平时积肥，需要就用，窑不断火，库不断肥。有些地方普遍推行了看牛员附带刈青，看水员拣野粪，种菜员铲草皮，食堂服务员积灰肥，讲卫生结合积家肥等办法，建立了常年积肥制度。
    各地还利用夏季山青，湖草繁茂，肥源丰富，和气温高、腐熟快的有利条件，把专业积肥和突击积肥结合起来。浏阳县出动十五万人，在三十多万亩田边挖凼来沤肥。
    过去，各地多是冬季播种绿肥。今年衡阳专区总结了宁远县夏季种绿肥生长快、产量高、节省劳力的经验，全区利用田边、塘边、河边等荒土空地种夏绿肥六十一万多亩，为晚稻准备了充足的肥料，并节省了大量的积肥劳力。全省各地也都因地制宜普遍推广了夏季种绿肥。
    大抓养猪、养牛积肥，也是夏季积肥运动的主要方面。全省养猪场都是按照农田的分布规划建立的。入夏以来，各地都根据历年来群众夏季刈青垫栏的习惯，纷纷刈青、垫栏制肥。在积肥的同时，各地还进一步发展了土化肥生产。
    据新华社贵阳12日电　贵州省各人民公社抓住山草丰盛的夏季，大力为大秋作物积制足够的肥料。
    为夺取大秋作物丰收，各地人民公社在田间管理中，都细致地安排了积肥工作。毕节专区各地人民公社，组织社员到积肥先进地区参观，及时推广积肥制肥的先进经验。中共威宁县委推广了龙街公社高原管理区坚持专业与全民、经常与突击、积肥与清洁卫生“三结合”的经验，全县6月份积制的肥料大大超过去年同期积肥量。黔南布依族苗族自治州和铜仁专区，在抢收抢种基本结束后，都安排10％左右的劳力上山割青，制造泡青肥和高温堆肥。有的地区还采取山上修圈、耕牛上山、就地割草积肥等办法，使夏季积肥做到多快好省。
    积制自然肥和造土化肥同时并举，是贵州夏季积肥的一个特点。贵定县在大力积制自然肥的同时，办起六百多个土化肥厂，制造了土化肥三十五万多斤。不少地区还根据当地土壤特性制造肥料。都匀市酸性土壤较多，便大造碱性土化肥。镇远县从县、社到管理区、生产队都造土化肥，为中耕追肥提供了大量肥料。（附图片）
    河南临汝县养猪事业高速度发展，在十个多月中，共积优质猪肥四十多亿斤，每亩地平均四千斤。这是城关公社程楼猪场的大批猪肥正送往秋田。　　　　　　　　　　　新华社记者　徐振炎摄
