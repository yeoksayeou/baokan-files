Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch: After basically completing the task of transplanting mid-season rice, people's communes in various parts of Guizhou are seizing the last opportunity for summer planting and making full use of scattered land to launch a "small summer planting" campaign focused on increasing and replanting crops, striving to plant more and harvest more. According to statistics from five regions, namely Zunyi, Tongren, Qiannan, Qiandongnan, and Guiyang City, by July 8th, more than 1.31 million mu of late corn, miscellaneous grains, beans, and other crops had been increased or replanted.

Since June, while grasping the full planting of rice, Party committees at all levels have organized forces to conduct detailed inspections of empty fields and various scattered plots of land, mobilizing the masses to plant late-autumn crops such as corn, soybeans, and buckwheat wherever cultivation is possible. In addition to mobilizing the masses to increase planting on scattered vacant land, the Bijie Special District also carried out intercropping on 3.1 million mu of land. Anshun City organized more than 20,000 people to vigorously carry out replanting and increased planting, planting miscellaneous grains and beans on more than 50,000 mu of scattered land in just two days. Guiding County organized more than 30,000 people to participate in the expansion campaign, and agencies, factories, mines, and schools also dispatched more than 5,000 people to form 217 shock teams to support neighboring production teams in increasing and replanting. The county replanted sparse and missing seedlings in more than 90,000 mu of rice fields, planted soybeans on hundreds of field ridges, and intercropped soybeans in 42,000 mu of cornfields.

This newspaper reports: The Jining area of Shandong Province has extensively launched a "small summer planting" campaign. The entire area has utilized scattered idle land such as village edges, riverbanks, pond edges, canal edges, in front of graves, behind houses, and fish-scale pits to plant more than 200,000 mu of grain, vegetables, and small oil crops.

Party organizations at all levels in this area regard making full use of idle land as an important measure to strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year. The Jining Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly issued the call to "vigorously grasp small summer planting, find opportunities, and not let an inch of land go to waste." Counties and communes carried out small summer planting campaigns based on the basic completion of summer sowing. In order to fully utilize the scattered idle land in the "ten edges," the Shiqiang Commune in Zou County summarized the achievements of planting 3,500 mu of small spring-sown crops this spring, improved the ideological understanding of the commune members, and then organized more than 1,200 people to carry out a large-scale inspection of scattered land, planting as they inspected. In three days, they planted more than 4,000 mu of various scattered vacant land. The Dongzhuang Commune in Qufu County put forward the slogan of "not letting an inch of land lie idle in thousands of mu, and not letting a single seedling be missing in ten thousand mu," and organized more than 500 cadres and experienced farmers to go deep into the fields to carry out "ten inspections" and "ten plantings." That is, inspect barren mountains and ridges, inspect roadsides, inspect field edges, inspect ridges, inspect riverbanks and canal sides, inspect pit and pond edges, inspect village heads, inspect residential yards, inspect forest land and gravesides, and inspect open spaces; plant sweet potatoes, soybeans, small beans, cowpeas, mung beans, green beans, vegetables, peanuts, sesame, and forage grass, totaling more than 1,800 mu of various scattered idle wasteland. In addition, more than 6,900 laborers were organized to reclaim and sow more than 1,180 mu.

In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of production teams and commune members for planting vacant land, all localities have clearly stipulated that large areas of vacant land such as river channels and canal sides should be managed and operated uniformly by the production team; small plots of land should be operated by the small team or cafeteria; and small, scattered idle land such as residential yards, courtyards, and in front of and behind houses should be planted by commune members, and whoever plants them harvests them. After the policy was publicized and implemented, it greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the commune members. After publicizing the above regulations, Teng County reclaimed and planted more than 45,000 mu within three to five days after rain. All 84,500 fish-scale pits in the county were also planted with crops. (Communication Group of the Office of the Jining Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China)

　　贵州各公社开展“小夏种”运动
　　山东济宁地区利用零星闲散土地扩种粮菜和油料作物
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州各地人民公社在基本完成中稻插秧任务后，抓住夏种的最后时机，充分利用零星土地，开展以增种、补种为主要内容的“小夏种”运动，力争多种多收。据遵义、铜仁、黔南、黔东南、贵阳市五个地区统计，到7月8日，已增种、补种了晚玉米、杂粮、豆类等一百三十一万多亩。
    6月份以来，各级党委在抓好水稻满栽满插的同时，组织力量对空田空地和各种零星土地进行细致的检查，发动群众将凡是能耕种的地方都种上玉米、黄豆、荞麦等晚秋作物。毕节专区除发动群众在零星空地上增种外，还在三百一十万亩土地上进行了套种间作。安顺市组织了二万多人大搞补种增种，仅两天时间就在五万多亩面积的零星土地上种上了杂粮、豆类。贵定县组织三万多人参加了扩种运动，机关、厂矿、学校也出动了五千多人组成二百一十七个突击队，支援邻近生产队增种补种。全县对九万多亩水稻进行了补稀窝补缺窝，在几百条田坎上种了黄豆，在四万二千亩玉米地里套种了黄豆。
    本报讯　山东济宁地区广泛开展了“小夏播”运动。全区利用村边、河边、塘边、渠边、坟前、屋后、鱼鳞坑等零星闲散土地，种植了粮、菜及小油料作物二十余万亩。
    这个地区各级党组织把充分利用空闲地，作为争取全年大丰收的一项重要措施。中共济宁地委及时地发出了“大抓小夏播、找缝插针、寸土不让”的号召。各县、社都在夏播基本结束的基础上，开展小夏播运动。邹县石墙公社为了充分利用“十边”零星空闲地，总结了今年春天播种的三千五百亩小春播作物的成绩，提高了社员的思想认识，随即组织一千二百多人，开展了零星土地大检查，并随查随种，三天种上各种零星空闲地四千多亩。曲阜县董庄公社提出了千亩不闲一寸土、万亩不少一棵苗的口号，组织五百多名干部、老农深入田间，开展了“十查”“十种”。即查荒山荒岭、查路旁、查地头地角、查畦埂、查河边渠旁、查坑塘边、查村头、查宅旁院后、查林地坟边、查空场、种地瓜、大豆、小豆、豇豆、绿豆、豆角、蔬菜、花生、芝麻、饲草、共查出各种零星空闲荒地面积一千八百多亩。此外，还组织了六千九百多名劳力，开荒播种一千一百八十多亩。
    为了调动生产队和社员种植空闲地的积极性，各地都明确规定：河道、渠旁等大片空闲地，由生产队统一管理，统一经营；小块土地由小队或食堂经营，宅旁、院落、屋前屋后等小零星闲散土地，由社员种植，谁种谁收。经宣传贯彻政策，大大激发了社员的积极性。滕县在宣传了上述规定后，在雨后三、五天内，就开荒种植了四万五千余亩。全县八万四千五百多个鱼鳞坑也都种上了作物。（中共济宁地委办公室通讯组）
