    Being a "Nurseryman" for New Things
    Li Yang
    When promoting rice transplanters, the CPC Shuyang County Committee in Jiangsu Province called on cadres at all levels to be "nurserymen" for new things.

    A "nurseryman," who is very caring for the next generation, works diligently day and night, at all times, for the growth of children.

    We also need this kind of nurseryman spirit when it comes to promoting and using rice transplanters.

    The Longji Commune in Shuyang County transported one hundred rice transplanters from the county. At first, many cadres thought the more the merrier, and wanted one after another. But in less than three days, as soon as the rice transplanters were put into use, some people found problems with machine transplanting. Coupled with unfamiliarity with the technology, they became suspicious. At this time, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee stood up and boldly supported the rice transplanters. He took a rice transplanting expert as his teacher, learning and studying repeatedly. After spending half the night, he finally found improved methods to overcome problems such as injury to seedlings and hooking seedlings caused by machine transplanting. The next day, at an on-site meeting in the commune, this excellent "apprentice" transformed into the best "teacher" for the brigade party secretaries. The "new apprentices" quickly "graduated." As a result, the transplanting progress of the entire commune was accelerated by two times, and most of the seedlings were transplanted densely, evenly, straightly, and firmly.

    The Party Committee Secretary's "nurseryman" spirit towards rice transplanters is indeed admirable and praiseworthy. He has a firm footing, a tough head, a great determination, and a good work style. He not only has the courage of "He who does not reach the Great Wall is no true man," but also the clever strategy of "Intelligent Capture of Mount Hua." This is the attitude of a true promoter towards new things.

    做新生事物的“保育员”
    李阳
    中共江苏省沭阳县委在推广插秧机的时候，号召各级干部做新生事物的“保育员”。
    对于下一代关怀备至的“保育员”，为了孩子的成长，日日夜夜，无时无刻不在尽心操劳。
    我们对待插秧机的推广使用，也需要有保育员的这种精神。
    沭阳县陇集公社从县里运回一百部插秧机，开始很多干部认为这家伙多多益善，要了一部又一部。可是没过三天，插秧机刚一上阵，有人发现机插有点毛病，加之使用技术不熟练，就怀疑了。这时公社党委第一书记站出来，大胆为插秧机撑腰。他拜机插能手为师，学了又学，学会又钻，用了整整半夜的时间，终于找出了克服机插发生伤秧、勾秧等毛病的改进办法。第二天，在全社的现场会议上，这位出色的“徒弟”一变而为大队支书的最好的“师傅”。“新徒弟”们很快地又“出师”了。这一来，全社的插秧进度加快了两倍，绝大部分插得又密又匀又直又稳。
    党委书记对待插秧机的这种“保育员”精神，确实是可敬可佩的。他脚跟稳，头皮硬，决心大，作风好。他不仅有“不到长城非好汉”的大勇，而且有“智取华山”的良谋。这是对待新生事物的真正促进派的态度。
