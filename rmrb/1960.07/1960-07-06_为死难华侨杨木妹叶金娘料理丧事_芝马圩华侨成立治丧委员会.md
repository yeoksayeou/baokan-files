    Handling Funeral Arrangements for the Deceased Overseas Chinese Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang
    Zhimaxu Overseas Chinese Establish Funeral Committee
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Jakarta: Over two hundred overseas Chinese in Zhimaxu, West Java, have formed a funeral committee to handle funeral arrangements for the deceased overseas Chinese women, Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang.
    When the West Java military authorities forcibly relocated overseas Chinese in Zhimaxu on the 3rd, armed military police shot and killed these two innocent overseas Chinese women with submachine guns.
    All day on the 4th, thousands of overseas Chinese from Bandung, Wan Yue, and other parts of West Java went to Zhimaxu of their own accord to mourn the victims of this tragedy and to express their heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased.
    Yang Mumei left behind eight children, the youngest of whom is only one year old. Ye Jinniang left behind seven children. Their children cried "Mama, Mama!" all day long! The overseas Chinese who came to mourn were filled with grief and indignation upon seeing this scene!

    为死难华侨杨木妹叶金娘料理丧事
    芝马圩华侨成立治丧委员会
    新华社5日电　雅加达消息：二百多名西爪哇芝马圩的华侨已经组成一个治丧委员会，为死难华侨妇女杨木妹和叶金娘料理丧事。
    在西爪哇军事当局3日强迫芝马圩华侨迁移时，武装军警用手提机枪射死了这两位无辜的华侨妇女。
    4日一整天，万隆、万悦和西爪哇其它地方有几千名华侨自动到芝马圩去为这一惨案的死难者致哀，并且对死难者的家属表示亲切的慰问。
    杨木妹遗下八个孩子，其中最小的只有一岁。叶金娘遗下七个孩子。她们的孩子整天哭着叫“妈妈，妈妈！”吊丧的华侨看到这一景象，都非常悲愤！
