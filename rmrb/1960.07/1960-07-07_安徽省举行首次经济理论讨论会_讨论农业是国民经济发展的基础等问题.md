Anhui Province Holds First Economic Theory Discussion Meeting
Discussing Issues Such as Agriculture Being the Foundation of National Economic Development

The first economic theory discussion meeting in Anhui Province was held in Hefei from June 6th to June 14th. Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the meeting focused on discussing two economic theory issues of great practical significance: one was the issue of agriculture being the foundation of national economic development; the other was the issue of correctly handling the relationship between the self-sufficient production and commodity production of people's communes. A total of thirty-five papers related to these two issues were presented at the meeting. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly revealed the internal connections between agriculture and various departments of the national economy, creatively demonstrated the principle that agriculture is the foundation for developing the national economy, thereby developing and enriching Marxist political economy. Especially as China's socialist construction enters a new stage of sustained leap forward, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have further determined the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading force, implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, which has great guiding significance for China's socialist construction to achieve high-speed, proportionate, and sustained leap forward. Regarding the relationship between the self-sufficient production and commodity production of people's communes, during the discussion, everyone believed that the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production is the correct policy for the development of production in people's communes and a brilliant manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the correct guidance of this policy, the consolidation and development of people's communes have been promoted, and the growing needs of national construction and people's lives have been guaranteed. Therefore, further understanding and implementing this policy has great practical significance.

At the meeting, there were also some different understandings of the above two major issues.

I. On the issue of agriculture being the foundation of national economic development

(1) Is the foundation of national economic development in agriculture a universal law?

Most people believe that the foundation of national economic development in agriculture is determined by the natural characteristics of agriculture itself. Because agriculture is the source of food and clothing for mankind and the foundation of survival, it is the starting point and prerequisite for the development of all departments of the national economy. No society can exist and develop without agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, which is a Marxist principle with universal significance. As Marx said, "Agricultural labor productivity that exceeds the individual needs of laborers is the basis of all societies." (Here, the so-called "basis of all societies" of course includes both class societies and communist societies that have eliminated classes.) Therefore, it is said that taking agriculture as the foundation is a universal law shared by various different social forms.

Some people disagree with this view. They believe that the foundation of national economic development in agriculture is determined by the nature, economic structure, and characteristics of socialism. It is a law unique to socialist society.

Others believe that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development is not forever unchanged. It is only a shared law of past societies and socialist societies. However, in communist society, science and technology have been highly developed, and the differences between industry and agriculture have been eliminated. Therefore, at that time, the development of the national economy will no longer be based on agriculture.

(2) Why does China further determine to take agriculture as the foundation?

Some people believe that this is mainly because China's current agriculture lags behind industry, and the development of agriculture cannot fully meet the needs of industry and the entire national economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to further determine to take agriculture as the foundation.

Many people disagree with the above view. They believe that further determining to take agriculture as the foundation is proposed based on the needs of the comprehensive and sustained leap forward of China's national economy, especially the development of industry and agriculture. On the one hand, it is to meet the needs of the rapid development of industry. Due to the rapid development of industry, agriculture is required to provide more and more food, raw materials, and labor. On the other hand, it is for the needs of agricultural development itself. Due to the realization of people's communes, agriculture's demands for mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification are becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, further determining that the development of the national economy should be based on agriculture can not only provide industry with more food, raw materials, and labor, but also meet the needs of agricultural development.

(3) On the issue of taking agriculture as the foundation and placing agriculture in a primary position.

Some people believe that taking agriculture as the foundation and placing agriculture in a primary position cannot be understood as two different things in general terms. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, which is an objective economic law that does not depend on people's will. The policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and placing agriculture in a primary position is a reflection of this law. It should be recognized that placing agriculture in a primary position is an extremely important strategic thought and strategic policy issue in national economic construction that cannot be arbitrarily changed. In national economic construction, if we understand the "primary position" of agriculture solely from the perspective of work arrangements, and not from the regularity of the internal connections between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, then this work arrangement will lose its basis in objective laws.

Most people disagree with the above opinion. The reasons are:

1.  The foundation of national economic development in agriculture refers to the status and role of agriculture in the national economy, which is an objective law that does not depend on people's will. However, agriculture occupies a primary position in the national economy, which is the specific application of the law that agriculture is the foundation in people's economic work. Although the two are closely related, they cannot be equated.

2.  Taking agriculture as the foundation is long-term and permanent, while placing agriculture in a primary position is not constant. Because the development of various departments of the national economy is unbalanced, there are different major contradictions in different periods. Which department occupies the primary position depends on the level of production development and political conditions in each period.

Some people also believe that placing agriculture in a primary position only illustrates that agriculture is very important. It does not mean that agriculture is primary and industry is secondary; agriculture is first and industry is second. Industry and agriculture have internal connections. They are interdependent and mutually promoting, and they must not be separated. Comrades who hold this view believe that under certain circumstances, it is possible and necessary to particularly emphasize the production of this department or that department. However, emphasizing this department does not mean neglecting that department.

(4) Is there a contradiction between industry and agriculture in China at present?

Some people believe that there is no contradiction between industry and agriculture in China at present. Because China's national economy is developing in a planned and proportionate manner, it cannot be said that there is any contradiction between them.

The vast majority of people disagree with this view. They believe that industry and agriculture are the two most important sectors of the national economy. They are interdependent and mutually restrictive. At present, China's industry and agriculture are both established on the basis of socialist public ownership of the means of production. They are fundamentally unified, mutually promoting, and mutually driving. This has been confirmed by the high-speed development of China's industry and agriculture. For example, the total industrial output value in the country in 1959 increased by 39.3% compared to 1958, and the total agricultural output value increased by 16.7% compared to 1958; the total industrial output value in Anhui Province in 1959 increased by 54% compared to 1958, and the total agricultural output value increased by 16.5% compared to 1958. However, it is also necessary to see the contradictory side between industry and agriculture. Contradiction is the driving force for social development. Denying and not daring to admit that there are still contradictions between socialist industry and agriculture is a metaphysical point of view.

II. On the issue of correctly handling the relationship between the self-sufficient production and commodity production of people's communes

(1) What is the objective basis for the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production in people's communes?

Some people believe that the implementation of the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production in people's communes is determined by the two forms of socialist public ownership and the characteristics of people's communes. The characteristics of people's communes are "large-scale and public," the integration of workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In order to compensate for the consumption of means of production and carry out reproduction, to add new means of production, such as seeds and livestock, and to meet the needs of commune members for food and other agricultural products, the commune must solve this through self-sufficient production. However, no people's commune can produce all the products it needs. In order to expand reproduction and meet the needs of commune members for industrial products, people's communes must, on the one hand, sell agricultural and sideline products and carry out commodity exchange; on the other hand, they must purchase means of production and daily necessities for commune members from state-owned enterprises under socialist ownership by the whole people. Communes also need to carry out commodity exchange to meet each other's needs. At the same time, vigorously developing commodity production not only meets the needs of the state and communes, but also increases public accumulation, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of people's communes.

Some people believe that the implementation of both simultaneously is not only determined by the two forms of socialist public ownership, but also by the current level of production and the system of distribution according to work. At present, because the level of production of people's communes is not very high, they cannot distribute according to needs. When the commune distributes according to the quality and quantity of the labor of the commune members, in addition to directly retaining a part of the products to meet the needs of commune members' lives, it must also sell a part of the products, exchange them for currency, and issue wages to commune members.

(2) The relationship between self-sufficient production and commodity production.

Everyone believes that the self-sufficient production and commodity production of people's communes are a dialectical unity relationship. They are complementary. The two have both differences and connections; they both restrict and promote each other; they are both contradictory and unified. Unity is the dominant aspect, which is manifested in the fact that the purpose of both is to develop the socialist economy and improve the material and cultural life of the people. The contradictory aspect is manifested in the distribution of means of production, production funds, and labor. If more is allocated to self-sufficient production, less is allocated to commodity production, which cannot meet the needs of national construction. Conversely, if more is allocated to commodity production, less is allocated to self-sufficient production, which will affect the production enthusiasm of commune members. However, the contradictions between the two can be continuously resolved as long as they are planned uniformly and arranged appropriately. In addition, everyone also raised different opinions on the fact that some people's articles only emphasized the unified aspect between the two, while neglecting and not daring to admit the contradictory aspect between the two.

### 安徽省举行首次经济理论讨论会  讨论农业是国民经济发展的基础等问题

    安徽省举行首次经济理论讨论会
    讨论农业是国民经济发展的基础等问题
    安徽省第一次经济理论讨论会，于6月6日至6月14日在合肥市举行。会议以毛泽东思想为指导，着重讨论了两个很有现实意义的经济理论问题：一个是农业是国民经济发展的基础问题；一个是正确处理人民公社自给性生产与商品性生产的关系问题。在会上提出有关这两个问题的论文共有三十五篇。在讨论中，大家一致认为：毛泽东同志深刻地揭示了农业和国民经济各部门之间的内在联系，创造性地论证了农业是发展国民经济的基础的原理，从而发展了和丰富了马克思主义的政治经济学。特别是在我国社会主义建设进入持续跃进的新阶段，党中央和毛泽东同志又进一步确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，在优先发展重工业的条件下实行工农业同时并举的方针，对我国社会主义建设高速度按比例地持续跃进，具有伟大的指导作用。对人民公社自给性生产与商品性生产的关系问题，在讨论中，大家认为：自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举是人民公社发展生产的正确方针，是毛泽东思想的光辉体现。在这一方针的正确指导下，促进了人民公社的巩固和发展，保证了国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要。因此，进一步认识和贯彻这一方针，有着重大的现实意义。
    会上，对上述两大问题还有一些不同的理解。
    一、关于农业是国民经济发展的基础问题
    （1）国民经济发展以农业为基础是不是普遍性的规律？
    多数人认为，国民经济发展以农业为基础，是由农业本身的自然特点所决定的。因为农业是人类衣食之源，生存之本，是国民经济各部门发展的起点和先决条件，任何社会离开了农业都不能存在和发展。农业是国民经济发展的基础，是一个具有普遍意义的马克思主义的原理，正如马克思所说的“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础”。（这里所谓“是一切社会的基础”当然既包括阶级社会，又包括消灭了阶级的共产主义社会）所以说，以农业为基础是各个不同社会形态所共有的普遍性的规律。
    有人不同意这种意见，他们认为国民经济发展以农业为基础，是由社会主义的本质、经济结构和特点所决定的，它只是社会主义社会所特有的规律。
    又有人认为，农业是国民经济发展的基础并不是永远不变的，它只是过去各个社会和社会主义社会的共有规律，但到了共产主义社会，科学技术已高度发展了，工农业差别也消灭了，因此那时发展国民经济就不再以农业为基础了。
      （2）我国为什么要进一步确定以农业为基础？
    有的人认为，主要是因为我国目前的农业落后于工业，农业的发展还不能完全适应工业和整个国民经济发展的需要，所以，才进一步确定以农业为基础。
    许多人不同意上述意见，他们认为，进一步确定以农业为基础，是根据我国国民经济全面的持续跃进、特别是工农业发展的需要而提出来的。一方面，为了适应工业迅速发展的需要。由于工业的迅速发展，就要求农业提供越来越多的粮食、原料和劳动力。另一方面，为了农业本身发展的需要。由于人民公社化的实现，农业对于机械化、水利化、电气化的要求，越来越加迫切，因此，进一步确定国民经济发展要以农业为基础，不仅给工业提供更多的粮食、原料和劳动力，而且可以满足农业发展的需要。
      （3）关于以农业为基础和把农业摆在首要地位的问题。
    有人认为，以农业为基础和把农业摆在首要地位，不能笼统地理解成为两回事。农业是国民经济发展的基础，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观经济规律，以农业为基础和把农业摆在首要地位的方针，正是这个规律的反映。应该认识到把农业放在首要地位，是国民经济建设中的一个极为重要的战略思想、战略方针问题，不能任意改变的。在国民经济建设中，如果我们把农业的“首要地位”，单从工作安排上去理解，而不从农业、轻工业、重工业的内在联系的规律性去理解，那末，这种工作安排，就失去了客观规律的依据。
    多数人不同意上述意见，其理由是：
    1、国民经济发展以农业为基础是指农业在国民经济中的地位和作用，是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律，而农业在国民经济中居于首要地位，这是人们在进行经济工作中对农业是基础这一规律的具体运用，两者虽有密切联系，但不能等同起来。
    2、以农业为基础是长期的、永久的，而把农业放在首要地位，不是不变的，因为国民经济各部门发展是不平衡的，不同时期有不同的主要矛盾，那个部门居于首要地位，取决于各个时期的生产发展水平和政治条件。
    也有人认为，把农业放在首要地位，不过说明农业是非常重要而已，并不是说，农业是首要，工业就是次要；农业是第一，工业就是第二。工业与农业有内在联系，它们相互依赖、相互促进，绝不能把它们割裂开来。持这种意见的同志认为，在一定的情况下，特别强调这部门的生产或那部门的生产，是可以的，也是必要的，不过，强调这个部门并不是就要忽视那一部门。
      （4）当前我国工业和农业之间是否存在着矛盾？
    有人认为，当前我国工业和农业之间没有矛盾，因为我国国民经济是有计划按比例发展的，所以，不能说它们之间存在着什么矛盾。
    绝大多数人不同意这种意见，他们认为，工业和农业是国民经济中最重要的两个部门，它们是相互依赖和相互制约的。当前我国的工业和农业，都是建立在社会主义生产资料公有制的基础上，它们之间在根本上是统一的，是相互促进、相互推动的，这已经被我国工农业高速度的发展所证实，如全国1959年的工业总产值比1958年增长了39.3％，农业总产值比1958年增长了16.7％；安徽省1959年的工业总产值比1958年增长了54％，农业总产值比1958年增长了16.5％。但是，也要看到工业和农业之间还有矛盾的一面，矛盾是推动社会发展的动力，否认和不敢承认社会主义工业和农业之间还有矛盾，这是一种形而上学的观点。
    二、关于正确处理人民公社自给性生产与商品性生产的关系问题
    （1）人民公社自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的客观依据是什么？
    一部分人认为，人民公社实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，是由社会主义公有制两种形式和人民公社的特点所决定的。人民公社的特点是“一大二公”，工农商学兵五位一体，农林牧副渔多种经营相结合，公社为了补偿生产资料的消耗和进行再生产，追加新的生产资料，如种子、牲畜等，满足社员粮食和其它农产品的需要，这就必须要通过自给性生产解决。但是，任何一个人民公社，都不能生产它自己所需要的一切产品，为了扩大再生产和满足社员对工业品的需要，人民公社一方面必须出售农副产品，实行商品交换，另一方面要向社会主义全民所有制的国营企业购买生产资料和社员生活的日常用品。公社与公社也需要进行商品交换，相互满足需要。同时，大力发展商品性生产，不仅满足国家和公社的需要，而且还增加了公共积累，有利于人民公社的巩固发展。
    有的人认为，实行两者同时并举，不仅是社会主义公有制两种形式所决定的，还由于目前的生产水平和按劳分配制度所决定的。人民公社目前由于生产水平还不很高，还不能按需分配，公社在按社员的劳动质量和数量进行分配时，除直接扣留一部分产品满足社员生活需要外，还必须出售一部分产品，换回货币，发给社员工资。
    （2）自给性生产和商品性生产关系问题。
    大家认为，人民公社自给性生产和商品性生产是辩证的统一关系。是相辅相成的。二者既有区别，又有联系；既相互制约，又相互促进；既是矛盾的，又是统一的。统一是主导的一面，它表现在二者的目的性都是为了发展社会主义经济，提高人民物质文化生活；矛盾的一面表现在生产资料、生产资金和劳动力的分配等方面，分配给自给性生产的多了，分配给商品性生产的就少了，这样就不能满足国家建设的需要。反之，分配给商品性生产的多了，分配给自给性生产的就少了，这样会影响社员的生产积极性。但是，二者之间的矛盾，只要通过统一计划，适当安排，就能不断地得到解决。此外，大家对个别人的文章中只强调二者之间统一的一面，而忽视和不敢承认二者之间的矛盾的一面，也提出了不同的意见。
