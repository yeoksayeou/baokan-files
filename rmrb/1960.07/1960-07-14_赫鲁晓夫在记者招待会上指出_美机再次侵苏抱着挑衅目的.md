Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. TASS reported from Moscow: Khrushchev made a statement at a press conference held in the Kremlin on the 12th regarding the intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into Soviet airspace again on July 1st. Following this, Khrushchev answered questions raised by journalists.

　　A journalist asked what the purpose was of the U.S. aircraft shot down on July 1st when it intruded into the Soviet Union. Khrushchev replied that the aircraft was definitely not carrying a letter of sincerity from the U.S. President to the Soviet government. It came with provocative intentions, and any provocation should be stopped.

　　Therefore, the plane was shot down by the Soviet army. If other planes do the same, then they will find their graves in the same way.

　　Someone asked if the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers could comment on the attitude of the British government and Prime Minister Macmillan regarding spy flights over Soviet airspace. Khrushchev pointed out that Macmillan's situation was disgraceful because he said one thing while doing another.

　　Someone asked Khrushchev how the Soviet Union's warning about retaliating against U.S. military bases in other countries should be understood after the recent U.S. aircraft incident. Khrushchev said that the warning should be understood exactly as Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky stated.

　　A journalist said that according to British newspapers, the United States is attempting to resume “U-2” spy flights and is discussing with its allies whether they will allow such flights from their territories. He asked Khrushchev what he thought of this news.

　　Khrushchev replied that if these flights are resumed, this will lead to a further escalation of tensions and a threat of war. The Soviet Union will not create such a pretext, but we will shoot down spy planes and implement the warning issued by the Minister of Defense.

　　Khrushchev said that the U.S. government's action of handing over rockets with hydrogen warheads to the Bonn militarists is a criminal act, because it is handing over weapons to the revanchists.

　　In answering another question, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union does not want to interfere in the affairs of Latin America in any way. The Soviet Union supports the freedom and independence of all countries, and when someone asks for it, it is prepared to give these countries economic and political assistance.

　　Khrushchev reiterated the statement he made at the All-Russian Teachers' Congress: If the United States refuses to buy Cuban sugar, then the Soviet Union will be happy to buy it. He pointed out that the actions of the United States will ultimately benefit the Cuban people because Cuba will be able to get rid of economic pressure from the United States.

　　赫鲁晓夫在记者招待会上指出
　　美机再次侵苏抱着挑衅目的
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：赫鲁晓夫12日在克里姆林宫举行记者招待会，就美国军用飞机于7月1日再次侵犯苏联领空发表了声明。接着，赫鲁晓夫回答了记者们提出的问题。
    有一个记者问到关于7月1日被击落的美国飞机是抱着什么目的侵犯苏联的问题，赫鲁晓夫回答说，这架飞机决不是携来美国总统致苏联政府的诚意的信件。它是抱着挑衅目的而来的，而任何挑衅都应当制止。
    因此，飞机被苏联军队击落。其他飞机如果这样做，那么它们同样也会给自己找到坟墓。
    有人问苏联部长会议主席能否就英国政府和麦克米伦首相对在苏联领空进行间谍飞行的态度发表评论。赫鲁晓夫指出，麦克米伦的处境是不光彩的，因为他所说的是一回事，而现在所做的是另一回事。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫，在发生了最近一次美国飞机事件以后，应该如何理解苏联提出的关于将给美国设在其他国家的军事基地以回击的警告。赫鲁晓夫说，正应当像苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅所说的那样来理解这个警告。
    一个记者说，据英国报纸报道，美国企图恢复
  “U—2型”飞机的间谍飞行，并且正在同它的盟国讨论它们是否允许从它们的领土上进行这种飞行的问题。他问赫鲁晓夫对这一消息有什么看法。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，如果恢复这种飞行，那么，这将导致紧张局势的进一步加剧，有爆发战争的威胁，苏联将不造成这样的借端，但是，我们将击落间谍飞机，并将实现国防部长提出的警告。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国政府准备把带有氢弹头的火箭交给波恩军国主义者的行动，是犯罪的行动，因为这是把武器交到复仇主义者的手中。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答另外一个问题时说，苏联对拉丁美洲的事务不想进行任何干预。苏联支持所有国家的自由和独立，当有人请求它的时候，它准备给予这些国家以经济上和政治上的援助。
    赫鲁晓夫重申了他在全俄罗斯教师代表大会上发表的声明：如果美国拒绝购买古巴的糖，那么，苏联将乐于购买。他指出，美国的行动最终将有益于古巴人民，因为古巴将能摆脱美国方面的经济压力。
