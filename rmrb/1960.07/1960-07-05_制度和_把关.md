Institutions can be rational or irrational. Irrational institutions hinder the development of productive forces, while rational institutions promote the development of productive forces. How can this be seen? Please read the report on the Tianjin Winch Factory published on this page today. The factory is doing very well in production, one of the reasons being that they have established a set of rational systems to ensure product quality.

What is an institution? In the case of an enterprise, it is a set of production rules formulated according to the objective laws of the production process. Rules are needed to achieve standards, and a set of rules is also necessary to ensure product quality. These rational rules do not depend on people's will. If you honestly abide by them, you can guarantee quality; if you do not abide by them, there is no guarantee of quality. Doing as you please is not acceptable.

However, don't think that having a good system is the end of the matter. Even the best systems require people to implement them. Without human initiative, the system will not function automatically. This is the key. Take the quality inspection system, for example. Many factories and mines have it, but whether the product quality is good or not depends on the inspection methods and how people implement them. One method is to set up several quality inspectors. This method should be said to be good, because having specialized personnel to "gatekeep" means that someone is responsible for the matter. But this method cannot be said to be the best, because production is a matter for the broad masses. The "loopholes" that a few professional quality inspectors can see are, after all, limited, and relying on a few people to gatekeep often results in "fish slipping through the net." Another method is to combine the professional inspection personnel with the inspection of the broad masses of workers, mobilizing the masses to gatekeep, which is a foolproof method. The Tianjin Winch Factory has adopted this method. When every production worker cares about quality, values quality, and becomes a quality inspector, defective products and waste products will have no chance to escape. If it escapes this gate, it will not escape the next gate. With "step-by-step consolidation," product quality is guaranteed.

Therefore, to ensure product quality, it is necessary to earnestly grasp these specific measures: first, there must be a rational system; second, there must be special personnel to inspect; and third, the broad masses must be mobilized to act as quality inspectors, and everyone must "gatekeep." With these three points, product quality will have a concrete guarantee.

    制度和“把关”
    陈之衍
    制度有合理的和不合理的。不合理的制度束缚生产力的发展，合理的制度却能促进生产力的发展。何以见得？请看今天本版发表的天津卷扬机制造厂的报道。这个厂生产搞得很好，原因之一，就是他们建立起一套合理的保证产品质量的制度。
    什么叫制度？以企业来说，就是根据生产过程的客观规律所订出的一套生产规矩。有了规矩才能成方圆，要想保证产品质量，也必须有一套规矩。这种合理的规矩，是不以人们的意志为转移的。你老老实实地遵守它，就能保证质量，你不遵守它，质量就没有保证。随心所欲是不行的。
    但是也不要以为有了一套好制度，就万事大吉了。再好的制度要靠人去执行。没有人的能动性，制度是不会自动起作用的。这是关键。拿质量检验的制度来说，许多工厂矿山都是有的，可是产品质量究竟好不好，却要看是什么样的检查办法，和人怎样去执行。一种办法是，设几个质量检查员。这个办法应当说是好的，因为有了专门人员去“把关”，就说明事情是有人负责的。但这种办法却不能说是最好的，因为生产是广大群众的事，几个专业质量检查员的眼睛所能看到的“漏洞”，毕竟是有限的，靠少数几个人去把关常常会有“漏网之鱼”。另一种办法是把专业的检验人员和广大职工的检验相结合，发动群众，人人把关，这才是一种百无一失的好办法。天津市卷扬机厂就是采取的这个办法。当每一个生产工人都关心质量、重视质量，都成为质量检查员的时候，次品和废品就插翅难飞了。它逃过了这一关，也逃不过下一关，“步步为营”，产品质量就一定有保证了。
    所以说，要保证产品质量，就要踏踏实实地抓这些具体措施：一要有合理的制度；二要有专人检查；三要发动广大群众都作质量检查员，人人来“把关”。有了这三条，产品质量才算有了具体保证。
