Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Bulawayo dispatch: Thousands of Africans in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, continued to demonstrate on the 26th, opposing the brutal colonial rule and suppression by the British colonial authorities.

　　Yesterday, about seven thousand African workers continued their strike and held rallies, demanding the immediate release of the leaders of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party, who were unreasonably arrested by the British colonial authorities. The strike by African workers has brought hundreds of factories run by colonialists in this industrial and commercial center of Southern Rhodesia to a standstill.

　　When these striking African workers demonstrated in the streets, they used stones to fight back against the colonial military police who provoked them.

　　This is the third day that Africans in Bulawayo have held demonstrations and fought back against the armed suppression by the colonial military police.

　　It is reported that a colonial military police force of 350 men is already "sweeping" through the African residential areas of Bulawayo, searching house to house and opening fire on Africans. A spokesman for the British colonial authorities revealed on the 27th that since the outbreak of demonstrations in Bulawayo, nine Africans have been killed by the police and colonialists.

　　An armed colonial army has deployed a four-mile-long "cordon" around the residential area of ​​colonialists in Bulawayo.

　　At the same time, in order to step up the mobilization of colonial troops to further suppress African demonstrators, the British colonial authorities announced that they have mobilized more local troops in many parts of Southern Rhodesia as a "precautionary measure" to support the colonial authorities' police. It is reported that the colonial army "First Battalion of the Royal Rhodesian Regiment", which was ordered to Bulawayo to participate in the suppression, concentrated in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, on the morning of the 26th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Bulawayo dispatch: In Bulawayo, the industrial and commercial center of Southern Rhodesia, African workers continue to persist in their strike struggle despite the armed suppression by the British colonial authorities. On the 26th, about seven thousand African workers held a rally at the local football field, resolutely rejecting the colonial authorities' demand that they return to work, and demanding the immediate release of the three leaders of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party who were unreasonably arrested by the British colonial authorities.

　　At the same time, the British colonial authorities continued to dispatch a large number of military police to suppress the anti-colonialist struggle of the Africans, broke into African areas to conduct house-to-house searches, and repeatedly opened fire on Africans. It is reported that on the 26th alone, three Africans were killed. Thus, since the 24th, at least eight Africans have been killed by the colonial authorities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 26th: The Cairo office of the Cameroon People's Union announced here on the 25th that the military communique from the headquarters of the Cameroon National Liberation Army stated that in the military operations taken by the Cameroon National Liberation Army from May 3rd to July 4th, a total of 869 enemy personnel were killed and 45 were wounded.

　　The communique stated that in these military operations, the Cameroon National Liberation Army captured a total of 32 rifles, 2 automatic guns, 3 revolvers, 1 radio receiver and 1 machine gun.

　　The communique said that most of the fighting took place in the Bamileke area. Other areas where fighting occurred were Wouri, Mongo, and the Sanaga coastline.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, July 25th: Britain is sending more troops to Kenya in Africa to suppress the local people's national independence movement. The British Ministry of Defense announced today that Britain will airlift an infantry battalion to Kenya on the 27th and 28th to strengthen the "strategic reserve force" there.

　　A Ministry of Defense spokesman said that this measure was a "precautionary measure taken in view of the current situation in the entire region."

　　This battalion of troops to be airlifted to Kenya is called by the British colonialists a "fire brigade" prepared to go to any place in the world "where trouble occurs". It is reported that the underground patriotic armed forces of the Kenyans have recently become active again, and the British colonial army conducted a "sweep" there last week in an area of ​​2,000 square miles. At the same time, in Southern Rhodesia, only a few hours' flight away from Kenya, the local people are currently heroically resisting the British colonial military police who are suppressing the national independence movement.

    新华社27日讯　布拉瓦约消息：南罗得西亚布拉瓦约城数千名非洲人26日继续举行示威，反对英国殖民当局的残酷殖民统治和镇压。
    昨天，约七千名非洲工人继续罢工，并且举行集会，要求立即释放被英国殖民当局无理逮捕的南罗得西亚民族民主党的领袖。由于非洲工人的罢工，使得这个南罗得西亚的工商业中心的数百家殖民者经营的工厂停工。
    这些罢工的非洲工人在街上示威时，用石块回击向他们进行挑衅的殖民军警。
    这是布拉瓦约城非洲人举行示威和反击殖民军警武装镇压的第三天。
    据报道，一支三百五十人的殖民军警已经在“扫荡”布拉瓦约城的非洲人居住区，挨户搜捕，并且向非洲人开枪。英国殖民当局发言人27日透露，自从布拉瓦约爆发示威以来，已有九名非洲人被警察和殖民者打死。
    一支武装的殖民军队已经在布拉瓦约城的殖民者居住区周围部署了一条四英里长的“警戒线”。
    同时，为了加紧征调殖民军队对非洲示威者进行进一步的镇压，英国殖民当局宣布，它已经在南罗得西亚许多地方召集了更多的地方部队，作为支持殖民当局警察的“预防措施”。据报道，奉调前往布拉瓦约参加镇压的殖民军“皇家罗得西亚团第一营”26日上午已在南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里集中。

    在这同时，英国殖民当局继续出动大量军警镇压非洲人的反殖民主义斗争，闯入非洲人区挨户进行搜查，并且多次向非洲人开枪。据报道，仅26日一天，就有三名非洲人被杀害，这样，自24日以来，至少有八名非洲人被殖民当局打死。

    公报说，战斗大部分是在巴米累克区进行的。发生战斗的其他地区是伍里、蒙戈和沙纳加海滨区。
    新华社伦敦25日电　英国增派军队去非洲怯尼亚镇压当地人民的民族独立运动。英国国防部今天宣布，英国将在27日和28日空运一个步兵营到怯尼亚去，以加强在那里的“战略后备队”。
    国防部发言人说，这种措施是“鉴于那一带整个地区目前的形势而采取的预防措施”。
    要空运到怯尼亚去的这一营军队被英国殖民者称为准备到世界上“发生麻烦”的任何地方的“救火队”。有消息说，怯尼亚人的地下爱国武装最近又趋活跃，英国殖民军队在上星期曾经在那里二千平方英里的地方进行了“扫荡”。同时在离怯尼亚只有不多几个小时的航空路程的南罗得西亚，当地人民目前正在英勇抗击镇压民族独立运动的英国殖民军警。
