Xinhua News Agency, June 30th: Vice Premier Chen Yi today met with Théodore Bengila, member of the National Steering Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the Congolese African Solidarity Party, and Jean Moundombo, member of the Political Bureau of the People's Party.

Today is the day of Congolese independence. During the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly congratulated the independence of the Congo. He said: The independence of the Congo is the result of the Congolese people's long and bloody struggle. Due to the heroic struggle of the Congolese people, the colonialists had to concede. The independence of the Congo will greatly encourage the anti-colonialist struggle of the African people and the struggle of oppressed nations around the world for national independence. The struggle of the Congolese people and the African people supports the Chinese people. The 650 million Chinese people will always fight alongside the Congolese people and the African people against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism. Final victory must belong to us.

Mr. Théodore Bengila said that we are proud that 650 million Chinese people support us, which shows that the independence of the Congo has received widespread support from people all over the world and is a great encouragement to the Congolese people. In their talks, Mr. Théodore Bengila and Mr. Jean Moundombo both highly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in construction.

Also present at the meeting were Zhang Xiruo, He Gongkai, Wu Xiaoda, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, June 30th: At a banquet held tonight by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to welcome two Congolese guests, people from China and the Congo warmly celebrated the victory of the Congolese people's struggle—the Congo declared its independence today.

Tonight's banquet was held to welcome Théodore Bengila, member of the National Steering Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the Congolese African Solidarity Party, and Jean Moundombo, member of the Political Bureau of the People's Party, who are visiting our country. In his welcoming speech, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Institute of Foreign Affairs, expressed his warm congratulations on the independence of the Congo. He pointed out that the independence of the Congo was not "bestowed" by Belgian colonialists, but the result of the Congolese people's long and heroic struggle. The Chinese people will always support the Congolese people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. He wished the Congo a prosperous and strong nation after independence, and its people happiness. He also wished the friendship between the Chinese and Congolese people would be enhanced, and the relations between the two countries would develop.

In his speech, Théodore Bengila said that today our compatriots are celebrating the independence of the Congo. The Chinese national leaders and various groups have sent congratulatory messages to the Congo, which shows how much you care about us. He said that the independence of the Congo was achieved by the Congolese people after a long and difficult struggle. Today, the independence of the Congo is only political independence. Our economy is still controlled by the colonialists, and we must continue to struggle. The real struggle has only just begun today.

Théodore Bengila said that the Congolese people who have stood up will never allow any colonialists to enslave them again, and all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism against us will be in vain. He expressed that they have friendly feelings towards the Chinese people, they do not recognize the so-called "two Chinas," but only recognize the People's Republic of China with 650 million people, and the Chinese territory of Taiwan will surely be liberated. He finally wished the friendly relations between China and the Congo would continue to develop.

In his speech, Jean Moundombo said that we Congolese people all regard the Chinese people as our friends and our brothers. He finally warmly wished China long live, independent Congo long live, and the friendship between the Chinese and Congolese people long live.

Among those present at the banquet were Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity; Zhu Ziqi, Secretary-General; Zhang Tiesheng, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association; Wu Qing, Secretary-General; Mei Gongbin, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee of the CPPCC; and Wu Xiaoda, Deputy Secretary-General of the Institute of Foreign Affairs.

    今天是刚果独立的日子。陈毅副总理在接见的时候热烈祝贺刚果的独立。他说：刚果的独立是刚果人民长期流血斗争的结果。由于刚果人民的英勇斗争，迫使殖民主义者不得不让步。刚果的独立对非洲人民的反殖民主义斗争和全世界被压迫民族争取民族独立的斗争都将起很大的鼓舞作用。刚果人民和非洲人民的斗争支持了中国人民，六亿五千万中国人民将永远和刚果人民、非洲人民一道反对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义而斗争。最后的胜利一定是属于我们的。
    西奥多·本基拉先生说，我们感到骄傲的是，六亿五千万中国人民都支持我们，这说明刚果的独立受到了全世界人民的广泛支持，对刚果人民是一个很大的鼓舞。西奥多·本基拉先生和让·穆东波先生在谈话中都盛赞中国人民在建设中取得的伟大成就。

    西奥多·本基拉在讲话时说，今天我们的同胞正在欢庆刚果的独立。中国国家领导人和各个团体向刚果发出了贺电，可以看出你们对我们是如何的关心。他说，刚果的独立是刚果人民经过长期的困难的斗争才取得的。今天刚果的独立还只是政治上的独立，我们的经济仍然操纵在殖民主义者的手里，我们还必须斗争，真正的斗争今天才是开始。
    西奥多·本基拉说，站起来的刚果人民是再不允许任何殖民主义者奴役他们的，美帝国主义对我们的一切阴谋都将是白费力气。他表示，他们对中国人民怀有友好感情，他们不承认有所谓“两个中国”，只承认拥有六亿五千万人民的中华人民共和国，中国的领土台湾必将获得解放。他最后祝刚中两国的友好关系不断发展。
