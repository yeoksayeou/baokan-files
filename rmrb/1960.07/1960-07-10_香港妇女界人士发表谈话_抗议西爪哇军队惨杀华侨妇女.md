Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 9th. Hong Kong women today issued statements in newspapers, angrily condemning the crime of the West Java army, instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia, in massacring overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang.

Chen Tingyan, an overseas Chinese woman residing in Hong Kong, said that powerful groups in Indonesia are forcing the relocation of overseas Chinese, plotting and supporting the West Java military authorities in killing defenseless overseas Chinese women. As a mother and an overseas Chinese woman, how can I not feel grief, anger, and protest against such bloody atrocities?

Pan Biwei, vice principal of Xiangqiang Middle School, said that the anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia have aroused the anger of all Chinese people. Now, the West Java military authorities are becoming increasingly fierce, even killing our innocent overseas Chinese sisters. We cannot tolerate such atrocities. Pan Yinghong, principal of Xinxiu Middle School, and Chen Ruozhi, principal of Hailufeng Public School, expressed extreme indignation at the crimes of the Indonesian military authorities. They firmly support the strong protest lodged by our Ambassador Huang Zhen to the Indonesian government.

Women's figures Guo Xiuqing, Li Huiying, Chen Mingyu and others stated that Hong Kong women cannot tolerate or stand idly by in the Zhima Market massacre. They support the strong protest lodged by Ambassador Huang Zhen, demanding that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, immediately stop all activities persecuting overseas Chinese, and guarantee the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" have published editorials and articles in recent days, condemning the crimes of the Indonesian armed forces in killing overseas Chinese women.
