    Pyongyang, July 29 (by our correspondent) The "Pyongyang News" published an article by Jin Mo on the 28th entitled "U.S. Imperialism is the Most Ferocious Enemy of Peace and Mankind," exposing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.
    The article stated: U.S. imperialism pursues a so-called "position of strength" policy, attempting to dominate the world, bloodily suppressing the people's struggles for national independence and freedom, and systematically carrying out aggressive actions and sabotage activities against socialist countries. U.S. imperialism attempts to gather the entire reactionary camp of the world around it. Precisely because of this, U.S. imperialism has become the chief culprit of world reactionary forces and a ferocious enemy of the people.
    The article continued: The "position of strength" policy, which U.S. imperialism based its policy of seeking world hegemony on after the war, has been bankrupted due to the resolute opposition of powerful peace forces and socialist forces. Despite this, U.S. imperialism is still treating the policy of preparing for a new war as the basic line of its domestic and foreign policies in order to realize its ambition of dominating the world.
    The article listed some remarks by the U.S. ruling clique: "The United States must face the possibility of war. Will peace be the entire purpose of foreign policy? Should everything be subordinate to this purpose? The answer must be no." (Rockefeller Brothers Fund Report on Foreign Policy) "We must have the ability to wage war when possible." (Stanford Research Institute report related to the U.S. military department) "Nuclear war can only be avoided when the world is ruled by a major power (referring to the United States)." ("U.S. News & World Report") In addition, there was the clamor of Rockefeller, the standard-bearer of the "Cold War," a few days ago: the U.S. government's strategy is a "preemptive strategy."
    The article listed a large number of facts to prove that the war policy of U.S. imperialism has become more blatant recently: in addition to the increase in military expenditures, the United States still has more than one million troops stationed in more than seventy countries. The United States has deployed 500,000 land, sea, and air forces in the Far East and the Western Pacific. The United States has established more than 250 military bases on the territories of other countries (more than 100 around Korea and China) and is vigorously building missile bases in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East. In addition, U.S. imperialism has undermined the disarmament conference, openly expanded its arms and prepared for war, announced that it would resume nuclear testing, and is preparing for underground nuclear explosion tests. The United States has increased its aggressive troops to South Korea by 8,000 and wants to supply West Germany and other Western European NATO member states with more than 300 "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles. The article condemned the United States for manufacturing new U.S.-Japan military alliances by means of blackmail and for carrying out military provocations in South Korea and the Taiwan Strait; and pointed out that the fact that the U.S. RB-47 aircraft violated Soviet airspace after the U.S. U-2 spy plane violated Soviet airspace fully proves that U.S. imperialism is not satisfied with undermining the summit conference, but is disturbing peace with frantic struggles. The article pointed out: After the war, U.S. imperialism ascended the international stage as an imperialist gendarme, barbarously suppressing the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for national independence and freedom.
    After emphasizing the U.S. imperialist crimes of aggression against Korea, the article listed the U.S. imperialists' frantic suppression of the national liberation struggles of the people of Laos, South Vietnam, and other Asian countries, supporting the French imperialists in carrying out colonial wars in Algeria, carrying out brutal interference in the Cuban people's struggle for national independence and freedom, and supporting the Belgian colonialists in suppressing the Congolese people.
    The article concluded: All the facts fully expose that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the world's people. At the same time, it tells the people of the world that they must further raise their vigilance and further strengthen the struggle to smash the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.

    朝鲜“平壤新闻”发表文章指出
    全世界人民必须进一步加强斗争
    坚决粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策
    本报平壤29日电　“平壤新闻”28日发表了金镇模写的题为“美帝国主义是和平和人类的最凶恶的敌人”的文章，揭露美帝国主义的侵略本质。
    文章说：美帝国主义奉行所谓“实力地位”政策，妄想称霸世界，血腥镇压人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争，又系统地进行着反对社会主义国家的侵略行动和破坏活动。美帝国主义企图把世界的整个反动阵营集结在它的周围。正因为如此，美帝国主义成为世界反动势力的元凶，成为人民凶恶的敌人。
    文章接着说：美帝国主义者在战后作为称霸世界的政策的基础的“实力地位”政策，因为遭到强有力的和平力量和社会主义力量的坚决反对而陷入了破产的命运。虽然如此，美帝国主义现在为了实现称霸世界的野心，仍然把准备新战争的政策当作它的对内对外政策的基本路线。
    文章列举了美国统治集团的一些言论：“美国必须正视战争的可能性。和平是否将是外交政策的整个目的？是否一切事情都要从属于这个目的？回答必须是不。”（洛克菲勒兄弟基金会关于外交政策的报告）“我们必须具有在可能的时候进行战争的能力。”（同美国军事部门有关的斯坦福研究所的报告）“只有由一个大国（指美国）统治世界时，才能避免核战争。”（“美国新闻与世界报道”）此外，还有“冷战”旗手洛克菲勒前几天的叫嚣：美国政府的战略是“先发制人的战略”。
    文章列举大量事实证明，美帝国主义的战争政策最近更加露骨了：除了军事费用的增加以外，美国现在仍然有一百多万军队驻扎在七十多个国家内。美国在远东和西太平洋地区布置了五十万名陆海空军。美国已经在他国领土上建立了二百五十多个（在朝鲜和中国周围有一百多个）军事基地，并在欧洲、远东和中近东大力建设导弹基地。此外，美帝国主义还破坏裁军会议，公开扩军备战，宣布要重新进行核试验，并准备着地下核爆炸试验。美国向南朝鲜增调八千名侵略军队，并要供给西德和其他西欧的北大西洋条约组织成员国以三百多个“北极星”式中程导弹。文章谴责美国以讹诈的方法制造新的美日军事同盟以及在南朝鲜和台湾海峡地区进行着军事挑衅；而且指出，在美国U—2间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空以后，美国RB—47型飞机又侵犯苏联领空的事实，充分证明了美帝国主义破坏了首脑会议还不满足，而以疯狂的挣扎扰乱着和平。文章又指出：美帝国主义在战后以帝国主义宪兵的姿态登上国际舞台，野蛮地镇压为争取民族独立和自由而斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动。
    文章在着重谈到美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略罪行后，并且列举了美帝国主义疯狂镇压老挝、南越和亚洲各国人民民族解放斗争、支持法帝国主义者在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争、对争取民族独立和自由的古巴人民进行凶暴的干涉以及支持比利时殖民主义者镇压刚果人民的一系列罪行。
    文章最后说：一切事实都充分地暴露了，美帝国主义是世界人民最凶恶的敌人。同时，也告诉全世界人民必须进一步提高警惕，必须进一步加强粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策的斗争。
