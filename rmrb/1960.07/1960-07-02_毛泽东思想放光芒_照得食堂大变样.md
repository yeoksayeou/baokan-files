In My Position

    Mao Zedong Thought Shines, Transforming the Dining Hall
    Xun Cunzhu, Public Dining Hall Administrator, Liu Village Management Area, Ronghe Commune, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province.

    The Enlightenment from Three Poor Peasant Households
    On August 1, 1958, with the establishment of the People's Commune, our team set up a public dining hall, and the commune members elected me as the administrator. By the summer of 1959, a wrong wind began to blow, saying that the dining hall should be dissolved, and some commune members were discussing it. The rich middle peasant Hao Kexin even shouted: "The dining hall has no advantages, and it won't work even in a communist society." People who were usually friendly to me also said: You spend all day serving people food and drink, working from dawn till dusk, and everyone still has opinions about you. It would be better to dissolve the dining hall, and you would be much happier working in the fields. At this time, I didn't know what to do, whether to dissolve it or continue running it? I couldn't make up my mind. I told the Party Branch Secretary, Xue Xuji, and he told me without hesitation: "Stand firm and resolutely continue!" The Party Branch also immediately held a meeting to discuss the future of the dining hall. At that time, there were a total of forty-two households participating in the dining hall in the team, and only eighteen households attended the meeting. Those who attended were all Party members, Youth League members, and poor and lower-middle peasants. At the meeting, the Party Branch Secretary explained the significance of running a public dining hall to everyone, and also led everyone to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," and "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." What Chairman Mao said in these articles gave everyone great inspiration and education. I saw that Chairman Mao said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "The direction indicated by these three poor peasant households is the direction of the 500 million peasants throughout the country. All individual peasants will eventually take the road firmly chosen by these three poor peasant households." This reminded me and gave me infinite confidence and strength. Three poor peasant households still want to persist in running the cooperative, and we have eighteen households, which is six times their number. Why can't we run a dining hall!

    We Must Look at Problems with a Class Perspective
    After the meeting, I was constantly wondering why Secretary Xue could see the problem correctly? Why did I become confused as soon as the wind changed? I talked to the Party Branch Secretary about this issue, and he told me that as long as I studied Chairman Mao's works, I could find the correct position and method for looking at problems and not lose my way. Secretary Xue saw that I was eager to study Chairman Mao's works and accepted me into the "Mao Zedong Works Study Group." The first night we studied "On Contradiction." "On Contradiction" starts with two worldviews. After listening with everyone for a whole night, I felt it was a bit difficult, and I started to retreat in my mind. I went to Secretary Xue and said that I didn't have much education, I didn't understand it, and I didn't want to study anymore. At this time, Comrade Xue Xuji patiently explained to me: "Studying requires hard work. Don't be afraid of not understanding. Just focus on it." I thought carefully that Secretary Xue's education was not much different from mine, and he could make something of it, so why couldn't I? So, I plucked up the courage and persevered. After studying for half a month, I got into the swing of things. I studied, related it to reality, and conducted thinking, comparison, analysis, and research, and my understanding of Chairman Mao's works became a little deeper. When I studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," I thought that it was not surprising that some rich middle peasants wanted to withdraw from the public dining hall. Their economic status was close to that of the rich peasants, and they were originally unstable. Their living conditions were better than ours, with surplus grain and oil, and they were afraid of losing out in the dining hall, so they wanted to leave the dining hall. After this, I understood who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to conduct ideological struggle against when running the dining hall. According to the spirit of class analysis, under the leadership of the Party Branch, we reorganized the dining hall and let those rich middle peasants who were unwilling to participate temporarily withdraw. In this way, we consolidated the dining hall ideologically and organizationally.

    Running the Dining Hall Well Promotes Production
    From this reorganization of the dining hall, I deeply realized that Chairman Mao's works are the guiding light for all our work, and the more I study, the brighter my heart becomes! So I studied the article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work." This article seemed to be addressed to me. The article said: "Do you want to win the support of the masses? Do you want the masses to put all their efforts into the front line? Then you must be with the masses, you must mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, you must care about the pain of the masses, you must sincerely seek the interests of the masses, solve the problems of production and life of the masses, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of houses, the problem of clothing, the problem of childbirth, solve all the problems of the masses. If we do this, the broad masses will surely support us, regard the revolution as their lives, and regard the revolution as their banner of supreme glory." From this, I deeply realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's saying about caring for the well-being of the masses, and I thought about how important my responsibility as an administrator was! If everyone is well-fed, we can ensure the continued leap forward in production and accelerate the development of socialist construction. So, how can we ensure that everyone is well-fed? I remembered that Chairman Mao told us that as long as we act according to the actual situation and give full play to our subjective initiative, we can definitely do things well. So, I worked with all the cooks to find ways and tricks to improve the variety and quality of the meals. As a result, since July of last year, the amount of grain consumed per person per month has been greatly reduced, and they have eaten better and more than before. The dining hall has been further improved, and the commune members are even more satisfied. Xue Guangzu happily composed a folk rhyme: "Chairman Mao's thought comes to the dining hall, eat well and save grain; no repeat meals for seven days, coarse grains are finely made and taste delicious."

    After the dining hall work was greatly improved, the commune members who had not joined the dining hall before asked to join the dining hall, and those who had withdrawn from the dining hall regretted it. Even Hao Kexin, the rich middle peasant who said that "the dining hall has no advantages," had to admit defeat in the face of ironclad facts. By December of last year, the dining hall had increased from eighty people to three hundred and eighty-nine people.

    Sincerely Thinking for the Masses
    After the expansion of the dining hall, a series of new problems arose: the dining hall could not accommodate so many people, and the supply of non-staple food and cooks became problems. What should we do in the face of this series of new difficulties and problems? I remembered what Chairman Mao taught us in "On Contradiction": "The old process is completed, and the new process occurs. The new process also contains new contradictions, and begins its own history of contradictory development." Here, Chairman Mao clearly tells us that contradictions constantly arise and are constantly resolved, which is the law of development of objective things. Therefore, I was not worried, and I decided to solve these problems.

    However, we couldn't find a suitable place in the village to use as a dining hall. Only the three rooms in my house were relatively spacious and could be used as a dining hall, but I was afraid that my wife would not agree. At this time, I remembered what Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, we can become people who are greatly beneficial to the people. People have different abilities, but as long as they have this spirit, they are noble people, pure people, moral people, people who have broken away from vulgar tastes, and people who are beneficial to the people." Chairman Mao's words really opened my mind, and I went back and used this principle to persuade my wife. She understood and vacated the three large rooms where she lived for the dining hall to use as a dining hall.

    How can we solve the supply of non-staple food and improve the lives of commune members? I thought about it for several days, but one person's thinking is not comprehensive enough. At this time, Chairman Mao's words reminded me again: "Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of the bridge or the boat, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of method, the task is just talk." ("Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work") What is the boat? Chairman Mao told us in the preface to "Rural Surveys": We should follow the mass line. I discussed it with the people in the village, and everyone told me that there are many *Lin Gen* (a type of rhizome) on the Yellow River滩, which can be eaten as grain and can also adjust the variety of meals. This is a new discovery, and the *Lin Gen* on the dozens of miles of the Yellow River灘 cannot be dug out. I dug back some *Lin Gen* to make starch with a try-it-and-see attitude, and sent it to the hospital for testing, which proved that this starch contains a lot of glucose. We immediately made 7,000 *jin* of starch from *Lin Gen*. The starch made from *Lin Gen* is really a good thing. Adding it to white flour can make more than a dozen kinds of delicious meals.

    Listening to Chairman Mao's Words, Moving Forward Continuously
    The dining hall's housing and non-staple food problems have been solved, but what about the problem of insufficient cooks? Should we ask the management area for labor or should we ask for labor from tool reform? I thought about it again and again. Now there is a great leap forward everywhere, and production is very busy. Although the dining hall work is also important, good steel must be used on the edge of the knife. So we resolutely adopted the second method, which is to mobilize all the cooks to reform the cooking utensils. But everyone had no technology, and they didn't come up with anything after reforming them again and again. I asked the Party Branch to send a technician, and the Party Branch Secretary said: Didn't Chairman Mao say that we should be the masters of the objective world? Reforming tools cannot rely solely on technicians, we must liberate our minds, dare to think and dare to do, and create ourselves. After listening to the Party's words, I and the cooks pondered together and finally made more than a dozen kinds of native mechanical cooking utensils such as "馍cutting machine", "vegetable cutting machine", and "dumpling wrapping machine". Greatly improved work efficiency, saved manpower, and the cooks were extremely happy. But there was still a problem, that is, the hand-pulled bellows was laborious and unsanitary, and the cooks felt that this was a fly in the ointment. I heard that the Ronghe Town People's Dining Hall learned from Tianjin's experience, using steam to cook food quickly and well, so I went to visit and study, and came back and imitated it. In the middle of making it, I suffered from one failure after another, and some people started to talk gossip, and I also felt frustrated. But when I thought of what Chairman Mao said: "The growth of any new thing has to go through difficulties and twists and turns. In the socialist cause, to think that one can succeed easily and smoothly without going through difficulties and twists and turns and without making great efforts is only a fantasy." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") I also remembered what Chairman Mao said: "After people have experienced failure, they also learn lessons from failure, correct their own thoughts to make them suitable for the regularity of the external world, and people can turn failure into victory, the so-called 'failure is the mother of success', 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit', is the reason." ("On Practice") Chairman Mao's words gave me great strength again. I summed up lessons from failures and continued to experiment. Finally, I found a "hot pot" method and successfully trial-produced the native steam engine in February this year, realizing the steamification of cooking and doubling the efficiency. Commune member Xue Qisheng happily said: "Chairman Mao's works bloom in red flowers, the dining hall is run differently, cooking is steamified, and there is no need to pull the bellows anymore." Now our dining hall has basically achieved "three-izations", that is, diversification of meals, mechanization of operations, and steamification of cooking.

    Although we have achieved great success in "three-izations" in the dining hall work, this does not mean that our dining hall work cannot be improved further. We have studied Chairman Mao's thought on continuous revolution, further organized the economic life of the commune members, and sought more benefits for the commune members. That is, since March of this year, our dining hall has also been handling the weddings and funerals of the commune members, managing the mailing of letters, subscribing to newspapers and periodicals for the commune members, and so on. The commune members said in unison: Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, transforming the dining hall, eating well and producing, and never leaving the iron dining hall.

    The achievements we have made in the dining hall work are truly the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we study Chairman Mao's works well and listen to Chairman Mao's words, we can be clever and agile, full of energy, and have eyes all over our heads. No difficulties can stop us from moving forward!

专栏：在我这岗位上

    毛泽东思想放光芒　照得食堂大变样
    山西万荣县荣河公社刘村管理区大众食堂事务长　寻存珠
    三户贫农方向的启示
    1958年8月1日，随着人民公社的成立，我们队里办起了公共食堂，社员们推选我担任事务长。到1959年夏天，不知从哪里刮起一股歪风，说要解散食堂，有的社员就议论纷纷。富裕中农郝克信还大叫大喊地说：“食堂没有优越性，到共产主义社会也办不好。”平时和我要好的人也对我说：你成天侍候人吃喝，起早搭黑地干，大伙对你还有意见，食堂散了也好，你到地里干上一份有多痛快。这时咱也不知如何是好，解散呢还是办下去？一时拿不定主意。我和党支部书记薛续稷一说，他毫不犹豫地告诉我：“要站稳立场，坚决办下去！”党支部还立即召开了一个会议，讨论食堂的前途问题。当时全队参加食堂的共四十二户，到会的只有十八户，参加会的人全是党、团员和贫农、下中农。在会上，党支书给大家讲了办公共食堂的意义，还领导大家学习了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《关于农业合作化问题》等文章。毛主席在这些文章中说的话，给了大家很大启发和教育。我看到毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》中说：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”这一下把我提醒啦，给我增加了无限信心和力量。三户贫农还要坚持办社，我们有十八户，等于他们的六倍，为什么不能办一个食堂呢！
    要用阶级的眼光看问题
    会后，我一直在纳闷，为什么人家薛支书对问题能看得正确？为什么自己一遇到风吹草动就思想混乱了呢？我和党支书谈起这个问题，他告诉我，只要学习毛主席著作，就能找到正确的看问题的立场和方法，不迷失方向。薛支书看我渴望学习毛主席著作，便吸收我参加了“毛泽东著作学习小组”。头一晚上学的是《矛盾论》。《矛盾论》一开始就讲的是两种宇宙观。跟着大家听了一晚上，自己觉得有些困难，思想上打起了退堂鼓，我就找党支书说，咱文化浅，学不懂，不学了。这时党支书薛续稷同志耐心地给我解释说：“学习要下苦功夫，不要怕不懂，只要用心钻就行。”我仔细一想，薛支书的文化和我差不了多少，他能学下个名堂，我为什么不行呢？这样，我就鼓起勇气坚持学下来。学过半个月以后，劲头就来啦。我一面读书，一面联系实际，进行思考、比较、分析、研究，对毛主席著作的理解就深刻了一点。当我学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》的时候，联想到有些富裕中农要退出公共食堂，这也不是奇怪的事情，他们的经济地位和富农接近，原本就有动摇性；他们的生活境遇比我们好，有余粮，有剩油，怕在食堂吃了亏，所以才要离开食堂。这以后，我明白了办食堂该依靠谁，团结谁，向谁进行思想斗争。根据阶级分析的精神，在党支部领导下，把食堂作了一番整顿，让那些不愿意参加的富裕中农暂时退出去。这样，就在思想上、组织上巩固了食堂。
    办好食堂促进生产
    从这次整顿食堂的工作中，我深深体会到毛主席的著作是我们各项工作的指路明灯，越学心里越是亮堂啦！于是我又学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文。这篇文章好像就是对我说的。文章里写着：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。我们是这样做了么，广大群众就必定拥护我们，把革命当作他们的生命，把革命当作他们无上光荣的旗帜。”我从这里深深体会到毛主席说的关心群众生活的重大意义，联想到自己担负事务长的责任是多么重大呀！如果让大家吃饱吃好，就能保证生产继续跃进，加速社会主义建设事业的发展。那末，怎样让大家吃饱吃好呢？我又记起毛主席告诉我们：只要根据实际情况，充分发挥主观能动性，就一定能把事情办好。于是，我和全体炊事员一齐动手，想办法，找窍门，改进饭菜花样，提高饭菜质量，结果自去年7月份以来，每人每月吃粮大大节省，还比过去吃的饱吃的好。食堂进一步得到改善，社员们更加满意了。薛光祖高兴得编了一个顺口溜：“毛主席思想到食堂，吃饱吃好又省粮；七天不吃重样饭，粗粮细做味道香。”
    食堂工作大大改善以后，以前没有加入食堂的社员纷纷要求加入食堂，以前退出食堂的人也很后悔，就连说“食堂没有优越性”的富裕中农郝克信，这时在铁的事实面前也不得不认输了。到去年12月，食堂便由八十人猛增到三百八十九人。
    切实为群众着想
    食堂扩大以后，一系列新的问题产生了：饭厅容纳不下这么多人，副食品供应和炊事员都成了问题。在这一连串新的困难和问题面前怎么办呢？我记着毛主席在《矛盾论》中教导我们的话：“旧过程完结了，新过程发生了。新过程又包含着新矛盾，开始它自己的矛盾发展史。”这里，毛主席很明确地告诉我们，矛盾不断发生，不断解决，就是客观事物发展的规律。因此，我也就不愁了，便下定决心来解决这些问题。
    可是，村里怎么也找不到一个合适的地点可以当食堂饭厅。只有俺家住的那三间房子比较宽敞，可以作饭厅，就是怕我女人不同意。这时，我又想起毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中说的话：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”毛主席的话，可真开了我的脑筋，回去又用这个道理去说服我女人，她思想也通了，就把自己住的三间大房子腾给食堂作了饭厅。
    怎样才能解决副食供应，改善社员生活？我曾经想了好几天，但一个人想的总不太全面。在这个时候，毛主席的话又提醒了我：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”（《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》）船是什么呢？毛主席在《农村调查》序言中告诉我们：应该走群众路线。我就和村里的人商量，大伙告诉我：黄河滩上蔺根很多，不但能当粮吃，还能调剂饭食花样。这是个新发现，几十里黄河滩上蔺根挖不完。我抱着试试看的态度，挖回一些蔺根制成淀粉，拿到医院一化验证明这种淀粉含有大量葡萄糖。我们马上用蔺根制了七千斤淀粉。用蔺根作的淀粉，可真是个好东西，掺上白面能做出十几种美味可口的饭食。
    听毛主席话不断前进
    食堂的房子和副食问题解决了，可是炊事员不足的问题怎么办？是伸手向管理区要劳力呢还是向工具改革要劳力呢？我想了又想，现在到处都在大跃进，生产挺忙，食堂工作虽然也重要，好钢总要用在刀刃上。于是我们坚决地采取了第二个办法，就是动员全体炊事员一起来改革炊事用具。可是大家都没有技术，改来改去没改出个样子。我向党支部要求派个技术工人来，党支书说：毛主席不是说要我们做客观的主人吗？改工具不能光依靠技工，必须解放思想、敢想敢做，自己来创造。听了党的话，我和炊事员们又在一起琢磨，终于制成了“切馍机”、“切菜机”、“包饺子机”等十几种土机械炊具。大大提高了工作效率，节约了人力，炊事员们都高兴极了。但是还有个问题，就是手拉风箱费力气又不卫生，炊事员都觉得这是美中不足。我听说荣河镇人民食堂学了天津的经验，用蒸汽作饭又快又好，就去参观学习了一回，回来便仿照着做起来。做的中间，遭到一次又一次的失败，有些人就说开闲话了，我也觉得败兴。可是一想毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）还想起毛主席说过：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”（《实践论》）毛主席这些话，又给了我极大力量，我从失败中总结教训，继续试验，终于找到了一个“火锅式”的办法，在今年2月间把土蒸汽机试制成功，实现了做饭蒸汽化，效率提高一倍。社员薛启胜高兴地说：“毛主席著作开红花，食堂办得变样啦，做饭实现蒸汽化，再不要把风箱拉。”现在我们食堂基本上实现了“三化”，就是饭菜多样化、操作机械化、做饭蒸汽化。
    在食堂工作上，虽然取得了“三化”的巨大成绩，但这不是说我们的食堂工作就不能再提高了。我们学习了毛主席的不断革命论的思想，进一步组织了社员的经济生活，更多地为社员谋求福利。这就是从今年3月以来，我们食堂还代办社员的婚、丧大事，代管邮寄信件，代社员订阅书报等等事情。社员们异口同声地说：毛泽东思想放光芒，照得食堂大变样，吃饱吃好闹生产，永远不离铁食堂。
    我们在食堂工作上做出的成绩，可真是毛泽东思想的胜利。只要好好学习毛主席的著作，听毛主席的话，我们就能心灵手巧，浑身是劲，满脑是眼，什么困难也挡不住我们前进！
