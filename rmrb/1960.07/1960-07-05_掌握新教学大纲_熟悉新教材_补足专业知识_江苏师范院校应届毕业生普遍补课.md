Mastering the New Teaching Syllabus, Familiarizing Themselves with New Teaching Materials, Supplementing Professional Knowledge
Jiangsu Normal Schools' Graduates Universally Take Supplementary Courses

    (Our Dispatch) Jiangsu Province's Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the requirements of the middle and primary school teaching reforms, are actively carrying out supplementary courses for normal school graduates, so that they can take on the teaching work of the new school system as soon as they leave school.

    This year, Jiangsu Province has more than 10,000 graduates from higher and secondary normal schools. In order to enable these students to quickly adapt to the needs of teaching reform after graduation, normal schools in various places are actively providing supplementary courses for graduates according to the requirements of the new middle and primary school teaching syllabus. Supplementary courses are based on the principle of "what to teach, what to learn, what is lacking, what to supplement." Anything that students have not learned in the past but will teach in the future must be supplemented. Through supplementary courses, these graduates will not only be able to undertake the teaching work of the newly compiled teaching materials, but also be able to play a backbone role.

    Now, in order to effectively carry out the supplementary course work, the Party organizations of many schools have generally investigated the actual level of students according to the requirements of the new middle and primary school teaching syllabus, and at the same time selected outstanding teachers to take on the supplementary course work. The Chinese, Chemistry, and Biology departments of Nanjing Normal College have understood the knowledge of the current graduates of their departments and found that two-thirds of the students need supplementary courses. For example, among the sixty graduating students of the Chemistry Department, 87% of the students can basically adapt to the teaching work of the pilot schools, but the trial teaching materials have added a lot of modern scientific knowledge. Many students have not learned this knowledge. Even if they have learned it, they have not mastered it deeply or thoroughly. Now, each department has formulated supplementary course plans to enable graduating students to master the trial teaching syllabus of the pilot middle schools, become familiar with the new teaching materials, and supplement the necessary professional knowledge and teaching methods through supplementary courses. In the supplementary courses, the Chinese Department requires graduates to supplement the basic knowledge and basic training in the areas of selected readings and composition. Further improve students' ability to read and analyze works. At present, all departments have successively entered the supplementary course stage.

    The measures taken by normal schools in various places to provide supplementary courses for graduating students have been warmly supported by teachers and graduating students. The graduating students of the Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry departments of Jiangsu Education Institute are all full of confidence and are striving to learn the knowledge required by the trial teaching syllabus and trial teaching materials of the pilot middle schools. More than 150 graduating students from Xuzhou Normal School have been involved in supplementary course studies since mid-May. The teachers of this school are all working hard to vigorously improve teaching methods and provide supplementary courses for students according to the teaching syllabus used in pilot primary schools. The school's Party branch also took into account that some of the graduates would be able to take on relevant courses in the pilot middle schools after graduation, and added relevant supplementary course content in this area. The supplementary courses include politics, an introduction to literature, classical literature, modern literature, grammar and rhetoric, algebra, trigonometry, and physics.

    Now, the Party committees in various parts of Jiangsu have made specific arrangements for the graduates' supplementary courses in accordance with the principle of combining work and rest. (Zhu Bingju)

    掌握新教学大纲　熟悉新教材　补足专业知识
    江苏师范院校应届毕业生普遍补课
    本报讯　江苏省各级党委根据中、小学教学改革的要求，积极进行师范院校应届毕业生的补课工作，使他们一出校门就能担任新学制的教学工作。
    江苏省今年高等和中等师范院校的应届毕业生共有一万多人。为了使这些学生毕业后迅速适应教学改革的需要，各地师范院校根据中、小学新学制教学大纲的要求，积极地对毕业生进行补课。补课是根据“教什么，学什么，缺什么，补什么”的原则，凡是学生过去没有学过的东西而今后要教的都要补。通过补课，使这些毕业生不仅能担当起新编教材的教学工作，而且能够起骨干作用。
    现在许多学校的党组织为了切实做好补课工作，普遍根据中、小学新学制教学大纲的要求，对学生的实际水平进行了调查，同时选拔了优秀的教师担任补课工作。南京师范学院中文、化学、生物等三个系了解了本系应届毕业生的知识情况，发现有三分之二的学生需要补课。如化学系六十个应届毕业生中，有87％的学生基本上能适应试点学校的教学工作，但试用教材中增加了不少现代科学知识，这些知识有很多学生没有学过，有的虽学过，但也掌握的不深不透。现在各系都订出了补课计划，使应届毕业生通过补课掌握试点中学的试行教学大纲，熟悉新教材，补足必要的专业知识和教学方法。中文系在补课中要求对毕业生补足文选、习作方面的基础知识和基本训练。进一步提高学生阅读和分析作品的能力。目前各系都先后进入补课阶段。
    各地师范院校对应届毕业生进行补课的措施，得到了教师和应届毕业生的热烈拥护。江苏教育学院数学、物理、化学三个系的应届毕业生，个个满怀信心，正在分秒必争地努力学好试点中学试行教学大纲和试用教材所需要的知识。徐州师范学校的一百五十多个应届毕业生从5月中旬起，就投入了补课学习。这个学校的教师们都鼓足干劲，大力改进教学方法，根据试点小学试用的教学大纲为学生补课。学校党支部还考虑到毕业生中有一部分人毕业后能担任试点中学的有关课程，便增加了这方面的有关补课内容。补课课程共设政治、文学概论、古典文学、现代文学、语法修辞、代数、三角、物理等。
    现在江苏各地党委都根据劳逸结合的原则对毕业生的补课作了具体安排。　（朱冰菊）
