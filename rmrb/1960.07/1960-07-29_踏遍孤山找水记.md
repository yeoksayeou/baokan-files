    A Record of Seeking Water Across Lonely Mountain

    Li Ming, the First Secretary of the Wanrong County Party Committee in Shanxi, and Secretary Wang Taishun, in order to overcome the drought, spent more than two months running all over a lonely mountain of forty li in radius, visited more than two thousand people, and finally found more than twenty springs and an underground water layer with a flow rate of.... The conclusion that "Wanquan (former name of Wanrong) has no springs" was overturned.

    Comrade Li Ming, the First Secretary of the Wanrong County Party Committee in Shanxi, and Comrade Wang Taishun, Secretary of the Secretariat, traversed every peak and depression of Lonely Mountain, uncovered the secret of "Wanquan (former name of Wanrong) has no springs", and led the farmers to split the rocks and dig out five springs around the mountain, with a flow rate of up to 0.03 cubic meters per second, which can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of farmland; currently, the flow rate of the springs is 0.015 cubic meters per second, irrigating more than 1,000 mu of land. They also found a flow rate of water at the foot of the mountain, which will turn 100,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. People praised: "Looking up at the high mountain without a drop of water, the drought demon has harmed us for thousands of years, the Party creates happiness for the people, splitting the mountain to capture the springs and irrigate the fields."

    The Suffering of No Water

    A flow rate of water, which is insignificant in places with abundant water sources, is a groundbreaking miracle in Wanrong County. Wanrong County is a loess plateau at an altitude of 1,800 meters above sea level, with thick soil and deep water. In the past, during drought years, people and livestock suffered from water shortages. Farmers queued day and night to draw water from deep wells, often leading to disputes over water and lawsuits. In severe drought years, production was even stopped, and cattle were driven to the Yellow River滩数十以至百里(shushili yizhi baili unclear) dozens or even hundreds of miles away to drink water. Farmers watched the seedlings they had cultivated with their own blood and sweat wither and die under the scorching sun, their hearts cut like knives. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the Party has led the people to dig wells, dig ponds, and build reservoirs to intercept and store rainwater, basically solving the problem of drinking water for people and livestock and ensuring the Great Leap Forward in production. However, there is no spring water in the territory to irrigate the fields, and it is still unable to resist in severe drought years.

    Water is the Key to Developing Production

    In August 1959, after Secretary Li Ming was transferred to work in Wanrong County, he began to consider relying on the masses to solve the water problem. Water, for Wanrong County, is the most basic key to developing production. After research and decision by the county party committee, more than 12,000 laborers were organized after the autumn harvest to build thirteen reservoirs along the沟(gou unclear) ditch. But how to dig a spring of living water here, so that people can drink wherever they want, wash whenever they want, and irrigate the fields? For this question, Secretary Li Ming and Secretary Wang Taishun, on one occasion, ran through half of Wanrong County non-stop, visiting grassroots cadres and many farmers. In the visits, when people mentioned finding water, they all thought that they could only find ways to intercept and store rainwater from the sky. Regarding the problem of digging out living water to irrigate the fields, they all shook their heads and said there was no hope. But Secretaries Li Ming and Wang Taishun did not give up their plan to find water because of this. They thought: Wanrong County has Lonely Mountain and Jiwang Mountain, and where there are mountains, there must be water. The problem is where the water is hidden! If it is hidden cleverly, we will look for it cleverly. In February this year, when the threat of drought became more and more serious, finding water became a matter of urgency. Without turning the tide with extraordinary means, the county's 560,000 mu of grain fields and 210,000 mu of cotton production plans would fail. At an emergency meeting of the county party committee, it was decided to immediately shift the focus of work to drought prevention and resistance, and mobilize the entire party and the entire people to focus on water. The two secretaries, Li and Wang, went deep into the countryside, visiting "water" among the masses during the day and talking about "water" together at night. Through visits, they discovered many clues. One place is Ronghe Commune, which is close to the Yellow River, and the groundwater is more than 300 feet deep; while the Niandi Management Area of Hanxue Commune lives at the foot of Lonely Mountain, and the terrain is higher than Ronghe Commune, but the groundwater is only 100 feet deep. Why is this? Another place is the water well in Jian溝(gou unclear) ditch Village in the embrace of Lonely Mountain, which is only a little over a丈(zhang unclear) ten feet deep and can be used to water gardens and grow vegetables. Lonely Mountain is very high, why can there be a ten-foot-deep well? It is said that there is a large stone cave on the top of Lonely Mountain, called Fayun Temple. Every time gas spews out of the stone cave, it will rain. Since there is no water under Lonely Mountain, why can water vapor be produced? In the minds of the secretaries, these questions are not mysteries, but the basis for the existence of underground water. One day, late at night, under the dim kerosene lamp, Secretary Li Ming opened the thread-bound "Wanquan County Chronicle" to consider these questions. According to the county chronicle: "Lonely Mountain has many springs, hence the name Wanquan", but "most of the springs are silted up, and there is no so-called water conservancy, only relying on the heavens to moisten the crops." Secretary Li chewed this sentence carefully. He thought: As long as there are many springs, we have the power not to let them be silted up (meaning blocked). The ancient King Yu could control floods, and Communists can force water out. From then on, the two secretaries were determined to wear out iron shoes to find living water. The next day at dawn, they carried dry food and went to Lonely Mountain to find water.

    A Spring of Water Flows into the Farmland

    The majestic Lonely Mountain stands high in the sky, and the large and small mountains are like saw teeth. The secretary's hot blood dispelled the spring cold in February. Both of them put their cotton coats under their armpits and climbed straight up along the rugged mountain road, walking and watching. Li Ming patted Wang Taishun's shoulder and said: "Look, from the perspective of water conservancy, these stones are symbols of water." They did not reach Yuanjia Village in the eastern depression of Lonely Mountain until from dawn to noon. There are upper and lower springs here. The upper spring seeps water from the ground, and the lower spring squeezes out a trickle from the cracks in the rock, but they all flow into the ground from the sand layer. As soon as the two secretaries saw the clear and green spring water, they forgot their dry mouths and tongues. They squatted by the spring and observed it for more than an hour. They seized this clue and ran all over the nearby temples, checking the records of the spring's perennial flow from the stone tablets. According to local old farmers, "For hundreds of years, this spring water has only been used for drinking by dozens of households in this village, and it is not enough to irrigate half an mu of land." After observation and analysis, the two secretaries unanimously believed that the spring water broke through the ground and seeped out, and it did not dry up in all seasons, indicating that the water source was large, and a lot of water could definitely be dug out by excavating it. However, in order to persuade the cadres and the masses with more facts, they ran to Bailin Temple, two li away, and patiently picked up the more than one hundred scattered stone tablets on the hillside, washed them clean, and checked them word by word. According to the stone tablets, Yuanjia Village had a large spring in the Ming Dynasty, and the spring water irrigated farmland more than twenty li away. Later, the spring mouth was crushed by a mountain collapse, and it no longer irrigated the fields. At the same time, they also discovered the water-loving animals and plants - 蛟子(jiaozi unclear) and horsetail, which further proved that the local groundwater was not deep. The water source was found, but the mountains were high and the rocks were large. How should the water be led down the mountain? Li Ming introduced to everyone the experience of people in the mountains of the plateau leading water down the mountain for dozens of miles along the mountain bends, and suggested casting channels with red clay to prevent water leakage. Li Ming's guidance lit up the hearts of the masses. Before dawn the next day, more than 350 water conservancy troops of the Hanxue Commune mobilized together, opening mountains and splitting ridges in the rumbling explosions, and sure enough, a spring of water was introduced into the farmland.

    Block the "Passing" Water

    The two secretaries continued to search along the valley. One day at noon, they came to Xinsi Village, which is located on the southeast mountain咀子(juzi unclear) mouth. After visiting the farmers, they crossed more than ten mountainridges and found Jiulong Spring in a place with lush water plants. This spring water was also squeezed out of the cracks in the rock. It is said that this water flowed away from the underground of Niandi Village. Therefore, they went down the mountain on the stepping stones and came to Dongniandi. According to the cadres here, a villager named Xue Bingnan spent one hundred taels of silver more than one hundred and thirty years ago to dig a well eleven zhang deep, and water often gushed out from under the slate as high as a person. This important discovery dispelled the fatigue of the secretaries' day of running around, and they immediately came to Xue Bingnan's house to measure the well. During the measurement, Li Ming saw the symbol of wheat straw moving from north to south on the surface of the water, and confirmed that this was a large area of "passing" water. They immediately sent people to survey and proved that there was a flow rate of water stored here. After the villagers' excavation, the well water that has been excavated is currently irrigating 200 mu of land in the drought resistance struggle.

    Fight with the Masses

    After entering summer, the sun like a brazier radiated strong light, the drought became increasingly serious, and the wheat seedlings were bent over by the heat. This time, in order to grab living water more and faster, the two secretaries Li and Wang set off on separate paths. Secretary Li Ming, who was getting old, was shining with youthful vitality. He went back and forth on the mountain for several days, and fought side by side with the migrant workers at the Wulong Spring water diversion construction site. Comrades saw that he was physically exhausted and could hardly hold on, and repeatedly advised him to rest, but he refused. The Wulong Spring water diversion project is very dangerous. To lead the water down the mountain from the waist of Lonely Mountain at an altitude of 1,650 meters, it is necessary to pass through eleven large and small mountain waists and pass through nine mountain ditches, with a total length of five li. After the construction entered a tense stage, Secretary Li Ming never left the construction site and studied with the masses to solve the problems of conveying air and reflecting light into the mountain洞(dong unclear) cave. He leaned over and drilled through the eleven mountain洞(dong unclear) caves with a length of 970 meters to check the problems in the construction. Although the cold air in the cave was pressing and breathing was suffocating, his fat body could only crawl forward, but he persisted in the fight. Secretary Wang Taishun, who was weak and sick, set off from the county party committee on the same day, inserted straight through the waist of Lonely Mountain, traveled 190 li on the chaotic rock mountain, passed through more than 40 mountains such as Longfeng Temple and Luanshi Ridge, and visited more than 70 masses. In this long journey, when he was hungry, he nibbled on some dry food; when he was thirsty, he set fire to boil water or drank a few mouthfuls of清泉(qingquan unclear) clear spring.

    From February 22nd when the two secretaries went up the mountain to April 25th when they went down the mountain, in more than two months, they ran all over a lonely mountain of forty li in radius, crossed more than one hundred large and small mountains, visited more than two thousand people, and found more than twenty springs and a underground water layer with a flow rate of water. When talking about the achievements of these water findings with the two secretaries, they were all very dissatisfied and said: The insignificant achievements are only the beginning of the work, and a bigger battle is still behind. In the future, every drop of living water must be led down the mountain, and at the same time, the Yellow River irrigation project must be completed at the fastest speed, so that the saying that "Wanquan has no springs" in history will be completely reversed from the minds of the people and become a well-deserved "Wanquan County".

    踏遍孤山找水记
    山西万荣县委第一书记李明、书记王太顺为了战胜干旱，用两个多月的时间，跑遍了方圆四十里的一座孤山，访问了二千多名群众，终于找到了二十多股泉水和一个流量的地下水层……。“万泉（万荣前名）无泉”的论断被推翻。
    董应南　李彦平　薛迈华　谢华　王顺林
    山西万荣县委第一书记李明同志、书记处书记王太顺同志，踏遍孤山一峰一凹，揭开了“万泉（万荣前名）无泉”的秘密，领导农民劈开山石，在沿山周围挖出五股泉水，流量可达零点零三秒公方，能浇田两千余亩；目前涌出泉水的流量有零点零一五秒公方，浇灌了一千多亩土地。他们还在山脚下找到了一个流量的水，将使十万亩旱地变成水田。人们歌颂道：“仰看高山无滴水，旱魔遭害几千年，党为人民造幸福，劈山擒泉浇庄田。”
    无水之苦
    一个多流量的水，对水源充足的地方来说，是微不足道的事，而在万荣县却是一个破天荒的奇迹。万荣县是个拔海一千八百米的黄土高原，地厚水深，过去每逢旱年，人畜大闹水荒，农民们日夜排队从深井汲水，常常因水闹架起讼；大旱的年景甚至停止生产，把耕牛赶到数十里以至百里以外的黄河滩去饮水。农民们眼看着亲身血汗作务起来的禾苗，在炎日烤烧下活活枯死，心如刀割。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，党领导人民群众打井、挖池、筑水库，拦蓄住天上雨水，基本解决了人畜吃水问题，保证了生产大跃进。但是，境内苦无一点活水浇田，遇到大旱年头，仍然无力抗拒。
    水是发展生产的关键
    1959年8月，李明书记调到万荣县工作后，就开始考虑依靠群众解决水的问题。水，对万荣县来说，是发展生产的最基本的关键。经过县委研究决定，秋后组织了一万二千个劳力，依沟筑起十三个水库。但如何在这里挖出一股活水来，让人们走到那里想喝就喝，想洗就洗，想浇田就浇田呢？为了这个问题，李明书记和王太顺书记，有一次不停地跑遍了小半个万荣县，访问了基层干部和许多农民。在访问中，人们一提起找水，都认为只能想办法拦蓄住天上雨水，对于挖出活水浇田的问题，都摇摇头说没有希望。但李明和王太顺两位书记并没有因此而放弃了找水的打算。他们想：万荣县有孤山又有稷王山，有山必有水，问题是水藏到妙处了！它藏的妙，我们就到妙处找。今年2月间，当旱象的威胁越来越严重的时候，找水的事，简直成了火烧眉目的大事，不以回天之力出奇制胜，全县五十六万亩粮田和二十一万亩棉花的丰产计划就会落空。在一次县委紧急会议上，通过了立即把工作重心扭向防旱抗旱，发动全党全民全力抓水。李、王两位书记就深入农村，白天到群众中访“水”，晚上坐在一起谈“水”，通过访问发现了不少线索。一处是荣河公社傍近黄河，地下水深三百多尺；而汉薛公社的埝底管理区住在孤山脚下，地势比荣河公社高，地下水却只有一百尺深，这为什么？又一处是孤山怀里涧沟村的水井，只有一丈多深，可以用来浇园种菜。孤山很高，为什么能有一丈深的水井？据说：孤山顶上有个大石洞，人称发云寺，每从石洞内喷出气来，就要下雨。孤山下面既然没水，为什么能够产生水蒸气？在书记的脑子里，这些问题都不是谜，而是地下有水的根据。有一天，夜深人静了，在微弱的煤油灯下，李明书记打开线装的“万泉县志”考虑这些问题。据县志记载：“孤山地多泉涌，故名万泉”，然“各泉类多湮淤，无所谓水利者，惟仰天泽滋夫禾稼”。李书记把这句话细嚼了一番，他想：只要地多泉涌，我们有力量不让它湮淤（堵塞的意思）。古代的禹王都能治理洪水，共产党人逼也要逼出水来。从此，两位书记都下了决心，要踏破铁鞋找活水。次日拂晓，就背起干粮上孤山找水了。
    一股泉水涌入农田
    巍峨的孤山耸立在高空，大大小小的山头像锯齿一般。书记的热血驱散了2月的春寒，两个人都把棉衣夹在腋下，沿着崎岖的山路直往上爬，一边走一边看。李明拍了一下王太顺的肩膀说：“你看，从水利学上讲，这些石头都是有水的象征。”他们从黎明到中午才到达孤山东凹的袁家庄。这里有上下两个泉，上泉从地下往出渗水，下泉从石缝里挤出了一股细流，但又都从沙层中流入地底。两位书记一看到碧绿清湛的泉水，连口干舌燥都忘了，两人蹲在泉边足足地观察了一个多小时。他们抓住了这条线，跑遍了附近的庙宇，从石碑上查出了该泉岁流不干的记载。又据当地老农说：“几百年来，这股泉水只供本庄数十户人家饮用，不足浇半亩田。”两位书记经过观察分析，一致认为泉水顶破地皮硬往出渗，四季又不干涸，说明水源很大，挖掘一下，一定能挖出大量的水来。但他们为了用更多的事实说服干部和群众，又跑到二里外的柏林庙，把零散在山坡上的一百多块石碑，耐心地拣起来，擦洗干净，一字一句地并在一起察看。据石碑记载：袁家庄在明朝时就有一大泉，泉水远浇二十里以外的农田，后因山塌压住了泉口，从此不再浇田。同时他们在考察中还发现了喜水的动植物——蛟子和马尾草，又进一步证明了当地的地下水并不深。水源找到了，但山高石头大，该如何引水下山呢？李明给大家介绍了在高原一带的大山中，人们沿山弯曲数十里把水引下山的经验，又建议用红胶土铸上渠道防止水的渗漏。经李明这么一指点，把群众的心点亮了。次日黎明前，汉薛公社的三百五十多名水利大军一齐出动，在轰隆隆的爆炸声中开山劈岭，果然把一股泉水引入了农田。
    拦住“过路”水
    两位书记沿着山谷，继续向前搜索。一天中午，来到了一个座落在东南山咀子上的新寺庄。访问农民后，又翻过十多架山墚，在水草丛生处找见了九龙泉，这股泉水也是从石缝中挤出来的。据说：这股水从埝底村地下流走了。因此他们踏着乱石下了山，来到了东埝底。听这里的干部们讲，社员薛丙南家曾在一百三十多年以前，花了一百两银子掘成一眼十一丈深的水井，经常从石板下冒出一人多高的水来。这个重要的发现，驱散了书记们奔走一天的劳累，立即来到了薛丙南家，对水井作了测量。在测量中，李明看到麦秆在水面上由北向南游动的象征，肯定了这里是一片很大的“过路”水。他们当即派人勘测，证明这里储藏有一个多流量的水。经过社员们挖掘，目前挖掘出的井水，在抗旱斗争中已经浇灌了二百亩地。
    和群众一起战斗
    进入夏季以后，火盆似的太阳放射出强烈的光芒，干旱日趋严重，麦苗儿被烤得弯腰了。这次李、王两位书记为了又多又快地抓到活水，两人分路出发。上了年岁的李明书记，浑身闪耀着青春的活力，一连几天在山上山下，往返了多少次，和民工们一起在五龙泉引水下山工地上并肩战斗着。同志们看出他身体疲倦得有点支架不住了，多次劝他休息，但被他拒绝了。五龙泉引水工程很险要，要从一千六百五十米高的孤山半腰，把水引下山去，必须穿过十一个大小山腰，路过九条山沟，全长五里。施工进入了紧张阶段以后，李明书记一刻不离工地和群众一起研究解决了往山洞输送空气、反射光线等问题。他伏着身子钻过了长达九百七十米的十一个山洞检查施工中的问题。虽然洞内寒气逼人，呼吸窒息，他那肥胖的躯体只能匍匐前进，但他一直坚持着战斗。身弱患病的王太顺书记，同一天，从县委机关动身，从孤山腰间直插过去，在乱石山上行程一百九十里，经过了龙风庵、乱石岭等四十多个山头，访问了七十多个群众。他在这漫长的行程中，肚子饿了，就啃几口干粮；渴了，他就搭火烧水或饮几口清泉。
    两位书记从2月22日上山到4月25日下山，前后两个多月的时间，跑遍了方圆四十里的一座孤山，翻越了一百多个大小山头，访问了两千多名群众，找到了二十多股泉水，和一个流量的地下水层。和两位书记谈起这些找水的成绩时，他们都很不满足地说：微不足道的成绩，仅仅是工作的开始，更大的战斗还在后面。今后要把每滴活水都引下山来，同时要以最快的速度完成引黄灌溉工程，把历史上“万泉没泉”的说法，从人们的心目中彻底扭转过来，变成名副其实的“万泉县”。
