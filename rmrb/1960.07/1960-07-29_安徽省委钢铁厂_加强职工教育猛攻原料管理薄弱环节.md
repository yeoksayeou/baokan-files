Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 28th: The Anhui Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant strengthened ideological education among workers and vigorously attacked weak links in raw material management, which rapidly improved the quality and output of pig iron. In the first half of July, the plant's pig iron qualification rate reached 94.7%, an increase of 10% compared to the second half of June; pig iron production also fulfilled the plan.

Since the beginning of this year, the plant's pig iron qualification rate has remained at around 95%, but in the second half of June, due to some people emphasizing quantity over quality, coupled with some problems in raw material management, the quality of iron fluctuated. After discovering this situation, the plant's Party committee quickly convened a conference of furnace chiefs and above, as well as a general meeting of all employees, comprehensively analyzed the reasons for the unstable quality, repeatedly explained the importance of improving quality, and adopted both practical and virtual methods, holding on-site meetings of typical examples of good and bad quality from the plant headquarters to the blast furnace, using actual examples to educate from both positive and negative perspectives. The plant also dispatched more than 90% of its cadres to the blast furnaces to directly participate in production, strengthen political and ideological education, and help workers improve pig iron quality. The Party committee secretary and the plant director also personally went to the furnace front, each undertaking a test furnace, using the test furnace as an example to educate workers and promote the entire plant. At the same time, they also tried every means to improve raw material management, and established calcination yards for limestone and iron ore near each blast furnace, and strictly implemented the system of "no impure raw materials enter the furnace, no unqualified particle size enters the furnace, no inaccurate weighing enters the furnace, and no untested materials enter the furnace," thereby promoting the rapid rise in pig iron quality.

    加强职工教育猛攻原料管理薄弱环节
    新华社合肥28日电　中共安徽省委钢铁厂加强职工思想教育，猛攻原料管理中的薄弱环节，促使生铁质量和产量迅速提高。全厂7月上半月的生铁合格率达到94.7％，比6月下半月提高10％；生铁产量也完成了计划。
    今年以来，这个厂的生铁合格率一直保持在95％左右，但是到6月下半月，由于少数人重产量、轻质量，再加原料管理方面存在一些问题，因而铁的质量产生了波动。厂党委发现这种情况以后，迅速召开了炉长以上干部大会和全体职工大会，全面分析了质量不稳定的原因，反复说明提高质量的重要意义，并且采取虚实并举的办法，从厂部到高炉，层层召开质量好坏的典型现场会议，以实际事例从正反面进行教育。厂里还把90％以上的干部下放到高炉，直接参加生产，加强政治思想教育工作，帮助职工提高生铁质量。厂党委书记、厂长也亲自深入炉前，每人搞一个试验炉，通过试验炉做出榜样，来教育职工，推动全厂。与此同时，他们还多方设法改进了原料管理，并且在各个高炉附近建立了焙烧石灰石和铁矿石的焙烧场，还严格执行了原料不净不入炉，粒度不合格不入炉，过磅不准不入炉，不化验不入炉的制度，从而促进了生铁质量的迅速上升。
