Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 22nd: The United Nations Security Council, after discussing the implementation of its July 13th resolution on July 21st, passed another resolution demanding the swift withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo.

This unanimously adopted resolution was jointly proposed by the representatives of Tunisia and Ceylon. The resolution requests the Belgian government to swiftly fulfill the Security Council's July 13th resolution demanding Belgian troop withdrawal and requests "all countries" not to take "any action that might hinder the Congolese government from exercising its authority, nor any action that might undermine the territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of the Congo." However, the resolution did not specify a concrete deadline for the Belgian troop withdrawal.

After the passage of this resolution, Soviet Representative Kuznetsov withdrew his proposal, made at the meeting on the 20th, demanding the complete withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo within three days. In explaining his vote, Kuznetsov said that the Soviet Union supported the joint proposal of Tunisia and Ceylon, but considered this proposal to be insufficient and that it would be more effective if the proposal, like the Soviet proposal, stipulated a deadline for the Belgian troop withdrawal. Kuznetsov said that this resolution should not be regarded as authorizing the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo. The Congo is an independent and sovereign state, and only the Congo itself can resolve all issues affecting it.

Prior to the vote, many representatives continued to speak out, condemning Belgium's aggression against the Congo.

Tunisian Representative Slim acknowledged in his speech that, to date, the Security Council had received no evidence that Belgian troops were withdrawing. On the contrary, Belgium had sent new troops into the Congo after the Security Council passed a resolution a week ago demanding Belgian troop withdrawal. Slim emphasized that Tunisia considered Belgium's dispatch of troops to the Congo as "a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Congo" and "an act of aggression against the Republic of the Congo." Slim also criticized activities aimed at splitting the Congo, emphasizing that Katanga could not be allowed to be separated from the Congo.

Polish Representative Lewandowski condemned the Belgian troops for invading the Congo and massacring Congolese residents under the pretext of "protecting the lives and property of white people" and pointed out that Belgium blatantly disregarded the Security Council's resolution demanding Belgian troop withdrawal.

US Representative Lodge reiterated his speech at the meeting on the 20th, insisting that the US policy of interfering in and infiltrating the Congo under the guise of the United Nations remains unchanged.

Representatives of other Western colonial countries such as Britain, France, and Italy also colluded with the Belgian colonialists, doing their utmost to defend Belgium's crimes in the Congo. British Representative Beeley openly stated that "Belgium has never committed aggression" and opposed setting a deadline for Belgian troop withdrawal. Beeley also described the Soviet Union's stern condemnation of the US, Britain and other Western colonial countries for supporting Belgian aggression against the Congo as "harmful activities" and claimed that "it is necessary to convince the Congolese government leaders that the Belgian government respects their newly won freedom."

At the meeting held on the 20th, Congolese Representative Kanza condemned Belgium's armed aggression against the Congo in his speech, demanding that Belgian troops withdraw from the Congo as soon as possible. Kanza said that the Security Council had made a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo, but Belgian troops have still not withdrawn. Kanza called for an end to the Belgian troops' aggression against the Congo and requested the Security Council to make a formal decision demanding that Belgian troops withdraw from the Congo as soon as possible.

Kanza denounced the Belgian colonialists' conspiracy to instigate Katanga's independence in order to split the Congo. Kanza said, "Katanga is part of our territory," and the Congo "will safeguard the integrity of our territory." Kanza also condemned the heinous crimes committed by the Belgian colonialists and their troops in the Congo. He said, "The independence of the Congo was won, it was not delivered on a silver platter." The Congolese people have long been subjected to "tyranny and barbarism," "Belgium is like a beast, these beasts have lost their morality."

Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny arrogantly stated in his speech that the Belgian government was disregarding the Congolese government's demand for Belgian troops to withdraw from the Congo within a specified period.

US Representative Lodge sided with the Belgian colonialists in his speech, opposing the speedy withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops from the Congo. He emphasized that United Nations troops should "maintain order" in the Congo and said that Belgian troops could only make a "phased" withdrawal when United Nations troops had "restored calm" in the Congo. Lodge made clear the US plot to use the United Nations to interfere in the Congo. He said that "all US aid" would be channeled through the United Nations and that "the United States can be counted on to continue to strongly support the United Nations' actions in the Congo." Lodge expressed hope that the United Nations force would increase to 10,000 within a few days, and he also said that the US military personnel would continue to remain in the Congo "as long as needed."

    刚果代表呼吁立即制止比利时侵略
    安理会通过决议要求比利时迅速撤军但未规定期限
    美国再次表示要用联合国的招牌对刚果进行干涉和渗入
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会21日在讨论它7 月13日决议的执行情况后又通过了一项决议，要求比利时侵略军队迅速撤出刚果。
    这项一致通过的决议是突尼斯和锡兰代表联合提出的。决议要求比利时政府迅速履行安全理事会7月13日通过的要求比利时撤军的决议，并且要求“所有国家”都不要采取“可能阻挠刚果政府行使其权力的任何行动，也不要采取可能破坏刚果共和国的领土完整和政治独立的任何行动”。但决议没有为比利时撤退军队规定具体期限。
    在通过这个决议以后，苏联代表库兹涅佐夫撤回了他在20日会议上提出的要求比利时军队在三天内全部撤出刚果的提案。库兹涅佐夫在解释投票的理由时说，苏联投票支持突尼斯和锡兰的联合提案，但是认为这个提案是不够的，如果这个提案像苏联的提案那样规定比利时撤军的期限，那就较为有效。库兹涅佐夫说，这个决议不应当被认为是授权联合国来干涉刚果的内政，刚果是一个独立的主权国家，只能由刚果自己来解决影响刚果的一切问题。
    在表决前，许多代表继续发言谴责比利时侵略刚果。
    突尼斯代表斯陵在发言中承认，迄今为止，安全理事会没有得到任何证据说明比利时军队正在撤退，相反地，在安全理事会在一周前作出要求比利时撤军的决议以后，比利时仍然派遣新的部队进入刚果。斯陵强调说，突尼斯认为比利时派兵到刚果是“对刚果的主权和领土完整的侵犯”，这是“侵略刚果共和国的行为”。斯陵同时指责分裂刚果的活动，他强调不能允许把加丹加从刚果分割出来。
    波兰代表利凡多夫斯基指责比利时军队在“保护白人的生命财产”借口下侵略刚果和屠杀刚果居民，并且指出比利时公然无视安理会要求比利时撤军的决议。
    美国代表洛奇再次宣读了他在20日会议上的发言，坚持美国盗用联合国的招牌对刚果进行干涉和渗入的政策不变。
    英、法、意等其他西方殖民国家的代表也同比利时殖民者串通一气，竭力为比利时在刚果的罪行辩护。英国代表比利公然说“比利时从未进行侵略”，并且反对规定比利时撤军的期限。比利还把苏联对美英等西方殖民国家支持比利时侵略刚果的严正指责说成是“有害的活动”，并且说什么“有必要使刚果政府领袖相信：比利时政府是尊重他们赢得的新自由的。”
    在20日举行的会议上，刚果代表坎扎在发言时谴责比利时对刚果的武装侵略，要求比利时军队尽速撤出刚果。坎扎说，安全理事会曾经作出要求比利时军队撤出刚果的决议，但是比利时军队目前仍然没有撤出刚果。坎扎呼吁制止比利时军队侵略刚果的行动，并且要求安全理事会作出正式决定，要求比利时军队尽速撤出刚果。
    坎扎指责比利时殖民者策动加丹加独立以分裂刚果的阴谋。坎扎说，“加丹加是我们领土的一部分”，刚果“将保障我们领土的完整”。坎扎还指责比利时殖民者及其军队在刚果犯下的滔天暴行，他说，“刚果的独立是争取来的，它不是放在银盘上送来的”。刚果人民长期经受“暴虐和野蛮行为”，“比利时像野兽那样，这些野兽失去了道德”。
    比利时外交大臣维尼在发言中蛮横地表示，比利时政府不理睬刚果政府要比利时军队限期撤出刚果的要求。
    美国代表洛奇在发言时站在比利时殖民者一边，反对比利时侵略军尽快撤出刚果。他强调要由联合国军队在刚果“保持秩序”，并且说，只有在联合国军队在刚果“恢复平静”时比利时军队才可以作“分阶段”的撤退。洛奇明白表示了美国利用联合国来干涉刚果的阴谋。他说，美国的“所有援助”将通过联合国，“可以指望美国将继续有力地支持联合国在刚果的行动”。洛奇表示希望联合国军队在几天内将增加到一万人，他还说，“只要需要”，美国的军事人员将继续留在刚果。
