　　Painting of Tall Pines
　　Poem by Chen Yi
　　Painting by He Xiangning
　　In June 1960, Elder Xiangning painted a picture of tall pines and asked for a poem to be added: Tall pines stand at the sea corner, plum blossoms and chrysanthemums protect them, secluded orchids also occasionally appear, clear springs gurgle among the rocks, green bamboos are even more leisurely, enduring the cold as always. Painting trees emphasizes nobility and purity, painting flowers delights in uniqueness. The master captures their spirit, leaving it all on paper. The painting is like the person, the direction is absolutely correct. Painting brings longevity, wishing both prosperity and abundance.

  一九六○年六月香凝老人以所画高松图嘱题高松立海隅，梅菊为之护，幽兰亦间出，清泉石中漱，绿竹更悠然，岁寒挺如故，画树重高洁，画花喜独步，大师撮其神，一纸皆留住，绘画如其人，方向毫不误，画高寿亦高，愿祝两繁富。
