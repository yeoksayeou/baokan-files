Brothers

By our reporter Yuan Shaotang

Linshan Commune in Yuyao County and Simen Commune in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, are two brother communes separated by a dike. There is such a pair of brothers here who are praised by the people: the elder brother, Xu Weijiang, is the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Linshan Commune; the younger brother, Xu Weizhen, is the Party Secretary of Simen Commune. This pair of brothers are truly good comrades-in-arms with strong fighting spirit, unity, and mutual assistance. They are good competitors who chase after each other and never give way. They are good cadres nurtured by the Party who share joys and sorrows with the masses and breathe the same air.

Close Comrades-in-Arms

At noon in late June, on a scorching hot day, I went to Linshan Commune to find Xu Weijiang. Xu Weijiang was weeding in the cotton experimental field with several commune members. He is of medium height, with a simple face, his trouser legs rolled up over his knees, barefoot, his skin red and black. If someone hadn't introduced him, I wouldn't have known that he was the Party Secretary of the commune, a veteran cadre who had been involved in the revolution for eighteen years.

Xu Weijiang and I walked and talked. He told me that this year they originally had fourteen mu of experimental fields. Last time he went to his brother Weizhen's commune and saw that his brother also had fourteen mu, and the cultivation work was done quickly and well. He became anxious. He came back and discussed it with several old commune members, strengthened the cultivation and management measures, and doubled the number of experimental fields, striving to surpass his brother in both quality and quantity. I had long heard that Weizhen was his rival in the competition. He and Weizhen had been competing for two years and never relaxed. Planting experimental fields is one of the contents of their brothers' competition. Xu Weijiang, whether it is in the hot summer or the cold winter, as long as he has time, always goes to the experimental field to participate in labor, humbly learns production knowledge and technical experience from the old farmers, and strengthens field cultivation management, determined to compete with Weizhen. In the competition, they are also good examples of socialist competition who adhere to "mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together." When it comes to planting rapeseed, Weijiang has more experience than Weizhen, so Weijiang took the initiative to help Weizhen learn the cultivation and management experience of high-yield rapeseed. When it comes to cotton experiments, Weijiang is an amateur, and Weizhen is an expert, so Weizhen promptly sent cotton seeds for the experimental fields and introduced to Weijiang on the spot a complete set of technical knowledge and management experience for cotton seed selection, seedling cultivation, pest and disease control, pruning, fertilization, and weeding. In order to surpass Weizhen in cotton, Weijiang also went to Simen Commune to learn from Gan Jinhai, a cotton-growing expert, and often asked him to provide technical guidance.

Xu Weijiang not only carries out tied-competition with his own brother, but also competes with cadres at all levels within the commune. He competes with cadres at all levels in the commune in planting experimental fields, comparing enthusiasm, measures, and yields every season, and using the experimental fields to drive the high-yield plots around him. Cadres at all levels then conduct competitions with the broad masses of commune members, driving the production of large fields. In fact, his experimental field is the model for cadres at all levels to learn from, and it is the command field that drives the entire commune's large fields. His purpose in engaging in experimental fields lies here.

Xu Weizhen, like his brother, is good at using experimental fields to drive the method of large field leadership and production. As soon as you enter Simen Commune, you can see tens of thousands of mu of various experimental fields, small farms, and high-yield plots run by cadres at all levels and the broad masses of commune members, forming a mass upsurge. Under the leadership of his brothers' tied competition, the competition of chasing after each other has also vigorously promoted the cadres and commune members of the two communes to conduct counterpart competitions. Now, here, commune against commune, team against team, department against department, and expert against expert, all-round tied counterpart competitions have been launched.

This pair of brothers were both old militia backbones in the revolutionary base area of the Siming Mountains before liberation. They risked their lives to organize militia to ambush Japanese devils and puppet troops, rush to deliver military grain, and protect leaders through liaison and cover. Now, they are chasing after each other on the agricultural front and advancing together.

All Shades of Purple and Red Herald Spring

On the morning of July 1st, Weizhen rushed back to the commune from the county committee. He heard that Linshan Commune, led by three-level secretaries and a large number of cadres, was coming to Simen to visit cotton. He forgot his fatigue and rushed to Linshan Commune. As he exited the station, he met his brother Xu Weijiang in the experimental field. "Weizhen, our cotton this year has fallen far behind your old brother again. Today we decided to go to your place to learn the scriptures." "You are always so modest. Look, isn't your experimental cotton growing better than ours? Today, I rushed here specially after hearing this news. First, I'll accompany you to our fields for a consultation and give us some suggestions for improvement. Second, I'll take the opportunity to see your experimental fields," Weizhen replied sincerely.

Weijiang calls Simen "old brother" for a reason. The origin of the tied competition between these two communes and their brothers lies in this sentence. Simen is a famous old cotton area in Cixi County, while Linshan used to be a rice area. After communization, according to the unified economic plan, it was changed to a half-rice and half-cotton area. At that time, the Party committee assigned Xu Weijiang to manage cotton. He knew that cotton is a very technical crop, and everyone didn't know how to grow it. What should he do? He suddenly thought that Simen Commune is an old cotton area with rich cotton planting experience, and it is their old brother. So, he made a suggestion to the commune Party committee for a tied competition, and the Party committee agreed. As soon as he said it, he did it. Early one morning, he sent a big red challenge letter to the Simen Commune Party Committee. The one who received him was his brother Xu Weizhen. His competition with Weizhen was thus tied up. Xu Weizhen thought, "One tree blossoms, a thousand trees are red; all shades of purple and red herald spring." So, the next day, he printed and distributed Linshan's challenge letter to all production teams in the commune, spreading it to every corner, and widely mobilizing the masses. The tied competition between the two communes was thus set off.

After lunch, Xu Weizhen accompanied Yao Min, the Party Secretary of Linshan Commune, and Deputy Secretary Xu Weijiang, leading a long visiting team, towards the boundless green sea of cotton fields. Simen's cotton is all transplanted from nutrient bowls. It is planted early, well managed, grows tightly, has lush leaves and tall plants, and is blooming and setting bolls. At a glance, it is really lovely. Linshan's cotton this year is also growing better than in previous years, but compared, it is still not as good as Simen's. The visiting team arrived at Simen Commune, visited the experimental fields of He Qiao'e, a famous high-yield cotton expert in the province, and the old cotton farmer Gan Jinhai, and was sucked in like they had encountered a magnet. This one counting the plants, that one looking at the bolls…, everyone started discussing. Xu Weijiang invited He Qiao'e and Gan Jinhai to introduce to everyone on the spot the cultivation and management experience of current mid-tillage, weeding, pruning, topping, pest control, and disease prevention. The people who came to visit from Linshan Commune listened attentively. After the visit, the commune members were even more motivated. A few days later, the weeds in the cotton fields of Linshan Commune were cleared, the ditches were deepened, and the ridges were heightened. The cotton was renewed day by day.

Giving Convenience to Others

The telephone line connecting Simen and Linshan was buzzing, transmitting the common aspirations of the commune members of the two communes: "Yes, our labor force is very tight, but you need labor more... Your difficulties are ours. Okay, don't say anything more, I will send two tractors to support you in plowing immediately." Xu Weizhen hung up the phone before Yao Min, the Party Secretary of Linshan Commune, could say "no." Yao Min thought that although Linshan Commune had expanded the planting area by seizing every inch of land this year, and the labor force was tighter than in any previous year, wasn't Simen Commune the same? How could he borrow an umbrella from someone on a rainy day! He was deeply moved by the communist style of the Simen Commune Party Committee, which gave convenience to others and left difficulties to itself.

And Xu Weizhen? Whenever he talked about Simen Commune winning three big red banners in a row last year, from spring flowers, cotton, to rice, he always excitedly told about the selfless support of Linshan Commune to them: Just after the cotton was planted, the weather was still cold and windy. Xu Weijiang led a group of cadres to Simen Commune to visit. Seeing that the nutrient bowls were not covered to prevent frost, they asked and found out that they could not buy straw. The day after Weijiang returned to the commune, boats and cars, like a long dragon, transported 500,000 jin of rice straw to Simen, bringing warmth to more than 70,000 mu of cotton seedlings in Simen. During the cotton transplanting, Simen Commune was very short of labor. The Linshan Commune Party Committee organized a young and strong labor force, including cattle and plows, and took the initiative to go to Simen to participate in the blitz. When Simen was vigorously developing soil fertilizer but lacked raw materials, Linshan Commune selflessly transported seventy boats of peat for making soil fertilizer….

Simen and Linshan have broken through county and commune boundaries and united into a whole, one will, and one force. Here is circulating a poem like this: "Linshan and Simen are dearer than dear, brother communes are heart to heart, supporting each other and cooperating greatly, joining hands and advancing together!"

    兄弟俩
    本报记者　袁绍棠
    浙江省余姚县的临山公社和慈溪县的泗门公社，是一堤之隔的两个兄弟公社。这里有这样一对受人赞颂的兄弟：哥哥徐渭江，是临山公社的党委副书记；弟弟徐渭珍，是泗门公社党委书记。这一对亲兄弟，真是一对斗志旺盛、团结互助的好战友，是一对你追我赶、各不相让的竞赛好对手，是一对党扶育出来的与群众同甘苦、共呼吸的好干部。
    亲密的战友
    6月末，一个烈日炎炎的中午，我到临山公社找徐渭江。徐渭江正和几个社员一起在棉花试验田里锄草。他中等身材，淳朴的脸膛，双腿裤脚过膝，赤着脚，肤色红中透黑，要不是人介绍，真不知他就是公社党委书记，是一位参加革命十八年的老干部。
    徐渭江和我边走边谈，他告诉我，今年原来搞了十四亩试验田，上次到他弟弟渭珍的公社去，看见弟弟也搞了十四亩，而且培育工作做得又快又好。他发急了，回来与几个老社员商量了一下，培育管理的措施加了码，试验田的亩数也增加了一倍，争取在质量和数量上都要超过他弟弟。我早就听说，渭珍是他竞赛中的对手，他与渭珍竞赛了两年，从来也不肯放松一步。种试验田是他兄弟俩竞赛的内容之一。徐渭江不管是炎热的夏天，严寒的腊月，只要他一有空，总是马上到试验田里去参加劳动，虚心向老农学习生产知识和技术经验，加强田间培育管理，决心与渭珍赛一场。他俩在竞赛中，又是一对坚持“相互学习，相互帮助，取长补短，共同提高”的社会主义竞赛的好榜样。种油菜，渭江的经验比渭珍丰富，渭江就主动帮助渭珍学习油菜高额丰产的培育管理经验。搞棉花试验，渭江是门外汉，渭珍是内行，渭珍就及时地送去试验田用的棉花良种，并向渭江实地介绍棉花的选种、培苗、治虫防病、整枝打脑、施肥除草等一整套的技术知识和管理经验。渭江为了在棉花上赶过渭珍，还上泗门公社拜棉花高产能手干金海为师傅，常常请他来作技术辅导。
    徐渭江不仅与自己的亲弟弟进行挂钩竞赛，而且还与社内的各级干部竞赛。他与公社各级干部赛种试验田，季季作物比干劲、比措施、比产量，通过试验田带动自己周围的丰产方；各级干部又与广大社员开展竞赛，带动大田生产。实际上，他的试验田就是各级干部学习的样子，是带动全社大田的指挥田，他搞试验田的目的也就在于此。
    徐渭珍也像他哥哥一样，善于运用试验田带动大田的方法领导生产。一进入泗门公社就可看到各级干部和广大社员搞的上万亩的各种试验田、小农场、丰产方，形成了群众性的热潮。你追我赶的竞赛，在他兄弟俩挂钩竞赛的带动下，也有力地促进了两个公社的广大干部和社员进行对口赛。现在，这里社对社、队对队、部门对部门、能手对能手，全面地展开了挂钩对口赛。
    这对亲兄弟，在解放前都是四明山区革命根据地的老民兵骨干。他们冒着生命危险，多次组织民兵伏击日本鬼子、伪军，抢送军粮，通过联络掩护首长。现在，他们又在农业战线上你追我赶，共同跃进了。
    万紫千红总是春
    7月1日清晨，渭珍从县委会赶回公社。他听说临山公社由三级书记带领大批干部要来泗门参观棉花，他忘掉了疲倦，赶去临山公社。出车站，在试验田里首先相见的又是哥哥徐渭江。“渭珍，我们今年棉花又大大落在你们老大哥的后面了，今天决定到你们那里去取经。”“你们总是那么虚心，你看，你的试验田棉花不就是比我们的长得好吗？今天我是得知这消息特地赶来的，一来陪你们到我们田头会诊一下，给我们提提改进的意见，二来，趁便来看看你的试验田。”渭珍诚恳地答道。
    渭江称泗门为“老大哥”有个来由，原来这两个公社和他们兄弟俩开展挂钩竞赛的起因，也就在于这句话。泗门是慈溪县有名的老棉区，临山过去是稻区，公社化后，根据统一的经济规划改为半稻半棉区。当时，党委分工由徐渭江管棉花，他知道，棉花是一种技术性很强的作物，大家都不懂种法，怎么办呢？他忽然想到泗门公社是植棉经验丰富的老棉区，是他们的老大哥，他就向公社党委提了一项挂钩竞赛的建议，党委同意了。说干就干，他一清早就把大红的挑战书送到泗门公社党委，接待他的就是他弟弟徐渭珍。他与渭珍的竞赛就这样挂上钩了。徐渭珍想：“一树开花万树红，万紫千红总是春”，于是，第二天就把临山的挑战书印发到全社各生产队，传遍各个角落，广泛地发动了群众，两社的挂钩竞赛就这样掀起来了。
    中饭后，徐渭珍陪同临山公社党委书记姚敏和副书记徐渭江，带着长长的参观队伍，向一望无际的绿海般的棉田走去。泗门的棉花丘丘是营养钵移植的，种得早，管得好，生得档紧、叶茂、株高，正在开花结铃。一眼望去，实在令人可爱。临山今年的棉花也比往年长得好，不过比较起来，还赶不上泗门。参观队伍到了泗门公社，参观了全省著名棉花高产能手何巧娥和老棉农干金海的试验田后，却像碰到吸铁石一样被吸住了。这个数档，那个看铃……，纷纷议论起来。徐渭江请来了何巧娥和干金海，向大家实地介绍当前中耕、除草、整枝、打脑、治虫、防病等培育管理经验。临山公社来参观的人，个个聚精会神地听着。参观结束后，社员们的干劲鼓得更足了。几天后，临山公社的棉花地里草光了，沟深了，垠高了，棉花样子日日更新。
    把方便让给别人
    泗门通向临山的电话线在嗡嗡地发响，是在传递着两社社员的共同心声：“对，我们的劳力是非常紧张，可是你们更需要劳力……，你们的困难就是我们的，好了，你别再说了，我马上派两辆拖拉机来支援你们翻耕。”徐渭珍未等到临山公社党委书记姚敏说个“不”字，电话筒就搁下了。姚敏想，虽然今年临山公社见缝插针扩大了播种面积，劳力比过去任何一年都紧张，可是泗门公社呢？不也是这样吗？怎么能向人家雨天借伞哩！他被泗门公社党委那种把方便让给别人、把困难留给自己的共产主义风格深深地感动了。
    而徐渭珍呢？一谈起去年泗门公社从春花、棉花到水稻一连获得三面大红旗时，总是激动地讲述起临山公社对他们的无私支持：棉花刚下种，天气还是寒风飒飒，徐渭江带着一伙干部到泗门公社来参观了。见到成片的营养钵没有防冻复盖物，一问是买不到稻草。渭江回社后的第二天，船接船、车连车像长龙一样，向泗门载来了五十万斤稻草，给泗门七万多亩棉花苗带来了温暖。在棉花移植的时候，泗门公社劳力十分紧张，临山公社党委组织了一支年轻力壮、连牛带犁的劳动大军，主动去泗门参加突击战。当泗门大搞土化肥而又缺乏原料的时候，临山公社又无私地输送了七十船做土化肥用的泥炭……。
    泗门和临山，已经打破了县界、社界，团结成为一个整体，一个意志，一个力量。在这里流传着这样一首诗歌：“临山泗门亲又亲，兄弟公社心连心，互相支援大协作，携手并肩齐跃进！”
