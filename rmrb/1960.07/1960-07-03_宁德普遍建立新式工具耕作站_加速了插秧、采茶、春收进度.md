Ningde Universally Establishes New-Style Tool Farming Stations
Accelerating the Progress of Rice Transplanting, Tea Picking, and Spring Harvesting

    (Reported by this newspaper) In Ningde County, Fujian Province, each commune has universally established new-style tool farming stations based on production brigades, utilizing new-style tool professional teams and new-style tool trial and experimental fields. This organizational form of one station, one team, and one field effectively strengthened the leadership in promoting new-style tools and further enhanced the effectiveness of the new tools.
    Based on the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement this year and the new situation of a large increase in the number and types of new-style tools, the Ningde County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experiences of the new-style tool field farming station in Zhangwan Commune and the new-style tool trial field in Yangzhong Commune, and held on-site meetings to promote them throughout the county. At present, more than 270 new-style tool field farming stations, 130 professional teams, and more than 2,700 mu of trial fields have been established throughout the county, ensuring that every new-style tool is promoted and used. Currently, more than 1,500 rice transplanters have been promoted throughout the county, with 87.6% being used consistently. In addition, more than 39,000 threshers, harvesters, double-wheeled single-blade plows, and other tools are being used, an increase of 84.9% compared to last year. The large-scale use of new-style tools has accelerated the progress of rice transplanting, tea picking, spring harvesting, and other production tasks. Although the total area of early rice in the county has increased by more than 50% compared to last year, the harvest was completed eleven days earlier than last year.
    The establishment of one station, one team, and one field has not only become a base for promoting new-style tools, but also a base for training commune technical teams. Many new-style tool professional teams have not only learned how to use and maintain new-style tools, but also learned repair techniques, making it possible to carry out minor repairs in the field and medium repairs at the station, greatly improving the utilization rate of the tools. New-style tool field farming stations have also universally established technical innovation research groups to carry out technical innovation activities centered on new-style tools, discovering problems in the promotion and use of new-style tools, and conducting collective research to improve them in a timely manner. Many farming stations have adopted measures such as holding technical training classes, field demonstrations to explain the performance of machines, methods of use and maintenance, and on-the-spot instruction in operating techniques. The commune members praised the farming stations with satisfaction as "field schools."

### 宁德普遍建立新式工具耕作站  加速了插秧、采茶、春收进度

    宁德普遍建立新式工具耕作站
    加速了插秧、采茶、春收进度
    本报讯　福建省宁德县各公社以生产大队为单位，普遍建立新式工具耕作站、使用新式工具专业队和新式工具试用试验田。这种一站、一队、一田的组织形式，有效地加强了推广新式工具的领导工作和进一步发挥了新工具的效能。
    中共宁德县委根据今年技术革新运动的深入开展和新式工具的数量、种类大量增加的新情况，总结了漳湾公社的新式工具田间耕作站和洋中公社的新式工具试用田的经验，分别召开现场会，在全县推广。目前全县已建立新式工具田间耕作站二百七十多个，专业队一百三十个和试用田二千七百多亩，保证了各种新式工具推广一件，使用一件。现在全县推广的插秧机就达一千五百多部，坚持使用的占87.6％，此外还使用脱粒机、收割机、双轮单铧犁等三万九千多件，比去年增加84.9％。新式工具的大量使用，加速了插秧、采茶、春收等生产的进度，虽然全县早稻面积比去年扩大50％多，但结束比去年提早十一天。
    一站、一队、一田的建立，不仅成为推广新式工具的基地，而且成为培养公社技术队伍的基地。许多新式工具使用专业队除了学会使用保管新式工具，还学会修配技术，作到小修不出田，中修不出站，大大提高了工具的利用率。新式工具田间耕作站，还普遍成立技术革新研究小组，开展以新式工具为主的技术革新活动，在推广使用新式工具中发现问题，及时进行集体研究加以改进。不少耕作站采取举办技术训练班，田间巡回表演讲解机器性能，使用、保管的方法，当场传授操作技术。社员满意地称赞耕作站是“田间学校”。
