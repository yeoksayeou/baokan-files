Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd – The following is the full text of the speech by Sudanese peace activist Ahmed Mohammed Kheir at the "People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Support the Congolese People's Opposition to Imperialist Aggression and Interference, and Defend National Independence Conference":

Dear friends and brothers:

Currently, we can certainly believe that the development of the situation is not favorable to the imperialists and colonialists. On the contrary, it is rapidly developing in a direction that favors Africans, including the Congolese people, as well as the people of Asia, Latin America, and all peace-loving and just people in the world. Today, Belgian aggressors, with the support of all imperialists and their propaganda machines, are attempting to drown the nature of their aggression in a sea of lies and deception. However, the truth is as clear as the sun over Africa. Only one week after the Congo declared its independence, Belgium, with the support of the United States and other imperialists, sent troops to the Republic of the Congo in an attempt to restore its colonial rule. This extremely tyrannical and barbaric criminal act against the Congolese people has added a new shameful mark to the many old and disgraceful marks on the faces of Belgium, the United States, Britain, and all other imperialists and colonialists. This criminal act is an aggression against the entire African continent, a slap in the face to all independent African countries, and an open provocation to the African independence movement and Afro-Asian solidarity. The Congolese people, who have sacrificed the lives of their finest sons and daughters to win independence, with the full support of their African brothers, and together with the people of Asian countries and all honest men and women around the world, will defeat the aggressors and consolidate their independence, no matter what conspiracies the imperialists play.

When the Congolese people made many sacrifices and finally won independence, the Belgian colonialists began their conspiracies, attempting to restore their power. The Belgian colonialists and Belgian monopoly capitalists, along with landlords and merchants from the foreign residents who make up less than 1% of the Congolese population, have been formulating their plans since the beginning of last year. On June 13, Pan-African News published a message saying: "The foreign residents' organization 'Congolese Federation' met in Bukavu, expressing opposition to the Belgian government's January 13 statement promising Congolese independence. The meeting felt that since their organization had high-ranking officials participating, they could make the government change its position. If they cannot obtain a change, they are considering the possibility of establishing a separate European zone, from Katanga to Ituri, including Kivu. Under these conditions, foreign residents are prepared to agree to the independence of the rest of the Congo." On January 24, 1959, a signed article in the New Statesman magazine confirmed this point, saying: "Although there are some pirates among them, generally speaking, they are still controlled by Brussels...they will not like this new policy." On January 21, 1959, The Times also wrote: "They are not opposed to the Congo having a democratic government, but they want Brussels to guarantee that there will be no form of 'black dictatorship'." These clearly prove that the aggression against the Congo is not because the residents of Belgium in the Congo need protection, but because 70% of the Congo's trade is controlled by five trusts, and the Brussels government holds 25% to 70% of the shares in these five trusts. They planned the aggression in order to continue plundering the rich mineral resources of Katanga, which contain copper, diamonds, aluminum, and gold. Of particular importance is that the United States, since 1955, through an agreement, has obtained 90% of the Congo's total uranium production. Not only that, but the United States also relies on the region south of the Sahara in Africa to obtain twenty kinds of major strategic materials. The United States, as the head of the Atlantic aggressive bloc, uses military bases in the Congo to serve its global strategy.

Dear friends, since the Belgian colonialists began plundering the Congo in 1855, until now, they have completely failed to prove what their king said on January 13. He said that they wanted to develop these backward countries, make them accept European civilization, rescue the people of these countries from slavery, disease, and poverty, and make them gain liberation, freedom, and progress. However, after seventy-five years of colonial rule, the Congolese people are still deprived of the opportunity to receive education, the opportunity to be treated for diseases, and the right to a level of survival that human beings should have. The parliamentary investigation team that went to the Congo to investigate the root causes of the January 1959 demonstrations said in its report: "Racial segregation exists in institutions, shops, and public places. Many Europeans do not yet understand the changing situation. Other reasons are economic recession, large-scale unemployment, and young people having nothing to do. Wage differences between Europeans and Africans are also a cause of dissatisfaction."

The colonialists shamefully forget all this, and talk a lot about law and order to cover up their barbaric and brutal history. What law, what order, reduced the Congo's population from thirty million to thirteen million? What law, what order, allowed the January massacre, which resulted in hundreds of people being shot? Apart from the law of imperialism and colonialism, the law of pirates and butchers, which is the law that the ruling group of the United States agreed to and implemented against blacks in the United States, the law that the French government agreed to and implemented in Algeria, the law that Britain agreed to and implemented in Kenya and other colonies, and the law that all colonial countries agreed to and implemented in their colonies, there is no law in the world that allows this to be done.

Dear friends, despite the treaties that have been imposed on the Congolese government, the aggression against the Congo once again proves that the nature of imperialism cannot be changed. People must never believe in the credibility of imperialism or the treaties it proposes, because imperialism does not understand what credibility is. They do not abide by what they say or promise. Two days ago, there was news that Belgian troops would be stationed at bases in the Congo in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the two governments. This clearly proves that foreign bases in the Congo and other parts of Africa are a huge threat to African independence. Belgian troops must be withdrawn immediately from the independent Republic of the Congo. The American troops who are using the pretext of assisting in the transportation of United Nations troops and relief supplies must also be withdrawn immediately. The conspiracy to split Katanga Province from the Congo must be exposed and smashed. Some military bases in the Congo must be abolished, because these military bases are the root cause of major dangers to the entire African continent.

I would like to assure my dear brothers that Africans recognize that the Chinese people are their completely reliable good friends. The firm support and solidarity of the Chinese people with the African people will forever remain in our hearts as a symbol of sincere brotherhood, and will further consolidate our ranks in the common struggle for independence and world peace. The assistance and support of socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, to the African people are the most important conditions for our success.

Victory belongs to the Congolese people who resist the enemy!

Long live the solidarity of all African people with the Congolese people!

Long live the unity of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America!

Long live the international united front against imperialism and colonialism!

Belgian troops must be driven out of the Congo!

Foreign bases in the Congo must be abolished!

Long live the independent Republic of the Congo!

Down with imperialism!

Long live world peace!

    必须把比利时的军队从刚果赶出去
    苏丹和平人士阿赫迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔的讲话
    新华社23日讯　苏丹和平人士阿赫迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔在“首都各界人民支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和干涉、保卫民族独立大会”上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们和兄弟们：
    目前，我们可以肯定认为，局势的发展不是有利于帝国主义者和殖民主义者，恰恰相反，它是朝着有利于包括刚果人民在内的非洲人、有利于亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人民的方向迅速发展。今天，比利时侵略者，在所有帝国主义和他们的宣传机器的支持下，企图用谎言和欺骗的海洋淹没他们进行侵略的性质。但是，事实真相却像非洲上空的太阳一样，在刚果宣布独立后仅仅一个星期，比利时在美国和其他帝国主义的支援下，就出兵刚果共和国，企图恢复它的殖民统治。这一反对刚果人民的极端横暴、野蛮的罪恶行为，在比利时、美国、英国及其他一切帝国主义者和殖民主义者脸上，在许多旧有的可耻的痕迹中，又添加了一个新的可耻的痕迹。这一罪恶行为是对整个非洲的侵略，是给所有非洲独立国家一个耳光，是对非洲独立运动和亚非团结的公开挑衅。为争取独立而献出了自己最优秀儿女的生命的刚果人民，在他们的非洲弟兄的充分支持下，和亚洲各国人民以及全世界一切正直的男女一道，不管帝国主义者玩弄什么阴谋诡计，定将击败侵略者，巩固他们的独立。
    当刚果人民作出许多牺牲终于赢得独立的时候，比利时殖民主义者开始了他们的阴谋诡计，企图恢复他们的权力。比利时殖民主义者和比利时垄断资本家，以及占刚果人口不足1％的外来居民中的地主和商人一道，从去年年初起就制订了他们的计划。6月13日，泛非新闻发表了一条消息说：“外来居民的组织‘刚果联合会’在布卡伏开会，表示反对比利时政府1月13日关于答应刚果独立的声明。会议感到，既然他们的组织有高级官员参加，他们能够使政府改变它的立场。如果得不到改变，它们考虑成立一个单独的欧洲区的可能性，从加丹加到伊图利，包括基伏在内。有这种条件的话，外来居民准备同意刚果的其余部分独立。”1959年1月24日，新政治家杂志发表的一篇有署名的文章中，证实了这一点，说：“虽然他们当中也有些海盗，但是总地说来，他们还是受布鲁塞尔管的，……他们不会喜欢这个新的政策。”1959年1月21日，“泰晤士报”也写道：“他们并不反对刚果有一民主政府，但是他们要布鲁塞尔保证不会有任何形式的‘黑人独裁’。”这些明确地证明，对刚果的侵略并不是由于比利时在刚果的居民需要保护，而是因为刚果的贸易有70％控制在五家托辣斯的手里，而布鲁塞尔政府持有这五家托辣斯的25％到70％不等的股票。他们策划侵略，是为了继续掠夺加丹加丰富的矿藏资源，那里蕴藏着铜、金刚钻、铝、黄金。尤其重要的是，美国从1955年起，通过一项协定，取得了刚果总产量90％的铀。不仅如此，美国还依靠非洲撒哈拉以南的地方，获得二十种主要的战略物资。美国作为大西洋侵略集团的头子，使用着在刚果的军事基地，为它的全球战略服务。
    亲爱的朋友们，自从1855年比利时殖民主义者开始掠夺刚果以来，直到现在，他们完全未能证实他们的国王在1月13日所说的话。他说他们想开发这些落后国家，使它们接受欧洲文明，把这些国家的人民从奴隶地位、疾病和贫困中拯救出来，使他们获得解放、自由和进步。但是，经过了七十五年的殖民统治以后，刚果人民仍然被剥夺受教育的机会、治疗疾病的机会和人类应有水平的生存权利。曾赴刚果调查1959年1月示威发生的根源的议会调查团在其报告中说：“在机关、商店和公共场所都存在着种族隔离。许多欧洲人还不了解变化中的局势。其他原因是经济衰退，大批失业，青年人无事可做。欧洲人和非洲人之间工资差别也是引起不满的原因。”
    殖民主义者可耻地忘掉了这一切，而大谈法律和秩序，来掩饰它野蛮残暴的历史。是什么法律、什么秩序使刚果人口从三千万减到一千三百万？是什么法律、什么秩序允许1月的大屠杀，使成百人遭到枪杀？除了帝国主义和殖民主义的法律，海盗和屠夫的法律，那是美国统治集团所同意而对美国国内的黑人所实行的法律，是法国政府所同意并向阿尔及利亚实行的法律，是英国所同意并向怯尼亚及其他殖民地实行的法律，是一切殖民国家所同意而向其殖民地实行的法律，世界上没有任何法律是允许这样做的。
    亲爱的朋友们，尽管已经有了强加于刚果政府的条约，对刚果进行的侵略，再一次证明了帝国主义的本性是不能改变的，人民决不可相信帝国主义信誉的话或由它提出的条约，因为帝国主义不懂得什么叫信誉，他们不遵守他们所说的话或诺言。两天以前，有这样的消息传来，说比利时军队将根据两国政府协议条款驻扎在刚果境内的基地。这清楚地证明了在刚果和非洲其他地方的外国基地是对非洲独立的巨大威胁。比利时军队必须立即撤出独立的刚果共和国。借口协助运送联合国军队和救济物资的美国军队也必须立即撤出。把加丹加省从刚果分裂出来的阴谋必须揭露和粉碎。在刚果的一些军事基地必须取消，因为这些军事基地是对整个非洲造成重大危险的根源。
    我愿向亲爱的兄弟们保证，非洲人认识到中国人民是他们完全可靠的好朋友。中国人民对非洲人民的坚决支持和声援将永远留在我们的心中，作为真诚的兄弟之谊的象征，并将在争取独立和世界和平的共同斗争中进一步巩固我们的队伍。以苏联为首的社会主义国家对非洲人民的援助和支持是我们获得成功的最重要的条件。
    胜利属于反抗敌人的刚果人民！
    全非洲人民对刚果人民的团结声援万岁！
    非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民团结万岁！
    反对帝国主义、殖民主义的国际统一战线万岁！
    必须把比利时军队从刚果赶出去！
    必须取消在刚果的外国基地！
    独立的刚果共和国万岁！
    打倒帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
