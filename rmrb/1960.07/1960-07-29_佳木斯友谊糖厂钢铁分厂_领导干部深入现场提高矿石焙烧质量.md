Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th. The steel branch of the Jiamusi Friendship Sugar Factory has focused on the management of "three materials"—ore, coke, and limestone—ensuring high-quality and high-yield pig iron. From January this year to the present, the factory's pig iron qualification rate has averaged over 97.5%, and pig iron production has also been steadily increasing.

The ore used by the steel branch of the Friendship Sugar Factory is of low grade and contains many impurities, and the quality of coking coal recently delivered to the factory has also not been very good. In order to "ensure high quality and high yield with fine materials," the factory's leaders and cadres adopted a method of division of labor and responsibility, going deep into the "logistics department" of steel production and the high-furnace production site, personally grasping raw material processing and classified management. Sun Jixing, the deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, was responsible for ore. He led the workers in launching a competition to refine lean ore and screen out impurities in the five processes of ore crushing, screening, transportation, and pre-furnace and batching, and conscientiously promoted the "six-character" experience of raw material management: "selection, cleaning, uniformity, grading, maturity, and heat." In order to ensure that the blast furnace eats fine materials, ripe materials, hot materials, and dry materials, they also mobilized the masses to vigorously roast and sinter ore, and built twelve roasting kilns, four sintering pans, and two hot pits in a very short time, thereby improving the ore grade and creating conditions for ensuring high-yield and high-quality pig iron.

Yue Mingwu, the factory director, and Xie Wenxuan, the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the steel branch, also went deep into the front line of production, working with the workers to study and improve the "long-kiln" type of coke oven, promoted the rapid coking method, and strengthened coke use management, achieving strict coke sorting and graded charging into the furnace, thereby solving the problem of low coke production and quality. In addition, in response to the high impurity content of limestone, they organized the masses to vigorously roast it, improving the quality of limestone. These measures have played a significant role in ensuring the quality of pig iron.

    佳木斯友谊糖厂钢铁分厂
    领导干部深入现场提高矿石焙烧质量
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　佳木斯友谊糖厂所属的钢铁分厂狠抓矿石、焦炭和石灰石“三料”管理，保证了生铁优质高产。从今年1月到现在，这个厂的生铁合格率平均达到97.5％以上，生铁产量也步步上升。
    友谊糖厂钢铁分厂所用的矿石，品位较低、杂质较多，最近到厂的焦煤质量也不大好。厂的领导干部为了做到“以精料保优质高产”，采用分工包干的办法，深入钢铁生产“后勤部”和高炉生产现场，亲抓炉料加工处理和炉料分级管理。工厂党委副书记孙吉星负责抓矿石。他领导职工在矿石粉碎、筛选、运料，以及炉前和配料等五道工序开展了炼贫矿、筛杂质的竞赛，认真推行了“选、净、匀、分、熟、热”的原料管理“六字”经验。为保证高炉吃精料，吃熟料，吃热料，吃干料，他们还发动群众大搞矿石焙烧和烧结，在很短时间内就建好十二个焙烧窑，四个烧锅，两个热坑，从而提高了矿石品位，为保证生铁高产优质创造了条件。
    这个厂的厂长岳明武和钢铁分厂党总支副书记谢文宣也深入生产第一线，同职工一起研究改进炼焦的“长垄窑”窑型，推行了快速炼焦法，并且加强焦炭使用管理，做到焦炭严格分选，实行分级入炉，从而解决了焦炭产量和质量不高的问题。此外，他们针对石灰石杂质多的情况，组织群众大搞焙烧，提高了石灰石质量。这些措施对于保证生铁的质量，都起了很大作用。
