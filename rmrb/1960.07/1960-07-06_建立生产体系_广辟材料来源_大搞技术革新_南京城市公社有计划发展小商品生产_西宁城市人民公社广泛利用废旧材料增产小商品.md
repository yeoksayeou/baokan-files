    Establishing a Production System, Broadening Sources of Materials, Vigorously Promoting Technological Innovation
    Nanjing Urban Commune Plans to Develop Small Commodity Production
    Xining Urban People's Commune Extensively Utilizes Waste Materials to Increase Small Commodity Production
    (Our Newspaper) News: With the establishment of urban people's communes, the production of small daily-use commodities in Nanjing is flourishing. In the first half of this year, the commercial system's purchase value was more than 25 million yuan, an increase of 76% over the same period last year. The second quarter of this year also increased compared to the first quarter. Recently, each commune has made unified adjustments to production teams that were previously scattered in operation and unstable in variety, in terms of manpower, equipment, and factory buildings. Professional factories and raw material production bases have been established to ensure the supply of goods to the market and further meet the needs of the people's lives.
    The production of small commodities in Nanjing's communes has developed along with the development of street industries. Its output accounts for 60% of the three thousand street industrial production units. In May of this year, the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee successively held two meetings to study the production of small commodities. It pointed out that in the current people's lives, there is an increasing demand for small daily-use commodities, but a small number of management cadres and grassroots cadres still lack sufficient understanding of this. The Municipal Party Committee criticized the erroneous view of a few cadres who believed that small commodities have small output value, low profits, are labor-intensive, and troublesome. It pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously develop the production of small commodities, starting from meeting the needs of the people's lives. Subsequently, each commune conducted a thorough investigation of products, output, equipment, and manpower, and organized similar industries into groups to establish an organized and professional production system. In terms of organizational leadership, the city specially established a Small Commodity Production Office, and each commune also has a bureau specifically in charge. The "seven-fix" method of fixing factories, tasks, equipment, labor, products, output, and quality was adopted to ensure that the small commodity production plan is implemented to factories, workshops, teams, and individuals, ensuring the completion of the plan. At present, the city has designated 259 professional small commodity production factories with more than 10,000 employees, producing more than 2,800 varieties, including more than 380 new varieties such as hair clippers and steel plates that were not previously produced. The production capacity of these factories can basically meet the needs of the city's people's lives. In addition, there are more than 2,000 street teams in the city that also produce small daily-use commodities.
    The supply of raw materials is an important part of the production of small commodities. Before the establishment of urban commune industries, the large factories that also operated small commodity production, or some scattered small commodity production cooperatives and groups, basically relied on allocations from higher authorities and external purchases for their raw materials. After the commune industries were established, relying on allocations and purchases could no longer meet the needs, but the commune industries are diverse, widespread, and spread throughout the city, making it easy to tap the potential of raw materials. Each commune adopted comprehensive utilization, material saving, the manufacturing of substitutes, clearing warehouses and collecting old materials, and mutual cooperation to solve the problem. The Sanitation Appliance Factory of the Sanpailou Branch of the Gulou Commune originally failed to complete its plan due to insufficient raw materials. Later, it cooperated with the Nanjing Clothing Factory to utilize the clothing factory's scraps (shreds of cloth) and completed the plan ahead of schedule. The Nanjing Bookbinding Factory lacked iron sheets for the production of spring clips, so it cleared warehouses everywhere to "search for treasures." As a result, it used canned food boxes to overfulfill the production task. The Feiyue Tool Factory of the Jianye Commune lacked medium-carbon steel for manufacturing files. They relied on their own efforts, using substandard iron to pour steel and carburize it as a substitute, which not only solved the difficulties, but also saved steel and coal. The Xianfeng Hardware Factory of the Jianye Commune used white cast iron instead of gray cast iron to make iron shells for electric light switches. The Jingsai Hardware Factory of the Baixia Commune completely replaced copper with iron to manufacture lock cores, and utilized hundreds of tons of recycled steel to manufacture small hardware products, which greatly solved the problem. In addition, each commune in the city also specially established raw material production bases, a total of eighteen factories, producing hundreds of kinds of raw material products such as roasted glue, artificial fiberboard, three acids (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid) two alkalis (caustic soda, soda ash), and mirabilite. Each commune also established panning factories, which extensively utilized industrial waste (shavings) from large factories, which also partially met the needs of non-ferrous and ferrous metals.
    After the establishment of commune industries and the establishment of a collaborative network for small commodity production, the variety of products became increasingly diverse, and technological innovation and technological collaboration also developed rapidly. The Nanjing Torch Hosiery Factory could only produce about ten kinds of coarse yarn socks in the past. After the communization, the leadership organized collaboration, learned from advanced experiences, and is now able to produce more than one hundred varieties of high-grade fine yarn socks. In the Confucius Temple area of the Qinhuai Commune, the original nine scattered teams could only produce three varieties, but now, after being organized, they have increased to fifty-three varieties. The Hongwuyue Bamboo Ware Factory of the Gulou Commune always split bamboo strips by hand in the past, and production could not be improved. Later, under the leadership of the commune, it learned from the advanced experience of similar industries and made a bamboo splitting machine, which increased efficiency by more than thirty times.
    Traditional handmade and finely crafted arts and crafts products have undergone major variety and technological innovations after communization. From January to May of this year, 814 new varieties were added, equivalent to the production projects of the entire year last year. The proportion of mechanical operation in production now accounts for 22.1%, and there are more than 200 innovation projects. The innovation of single embroidery machines allows one person to do the work of eighteen people. The 164 varieties that were squeezed out in the past due to insufficient equipment, materials, and labor in some factories in the Gulou Commune have not only all resumed production, but have also increased by 175 varieties. Summer products such as prickly heat powder, straw hats, bathtubs, and slippers have been successively put on the market.
    At present, some communes are also carrying out a major competition with the theme of low prices, good quality, a wide variety of products, and timely supply, to further increase the production of small commodities and meet the growing needs of the people's lives.
    (Our Newspaper) News: The commune-run industries in Xining City, Qinghai Province, actively serve the lives of residents and the market supply, and vigorously carry out the production of small commodities. The garment factory and shoe factory of the Dongguan People's Commune alone produced more than 50,000 pieces of various garments and more than 5,000 pairs of shoes in May. The supply and inventory of small commodities in the city have increased significantly.
    In the production of small commodities, each commune-run factory has fully utilized waste materials according to the principle of self-reliance to solve the problems of raw materials. The Hardware Factory of the Chengzhong District People's Commune has produced a large number of water tanks, iron spoons, and kitchen knives using waste iron and broken cans since April. The Hardware Factory of the Dongguan People's Commune produced more than 9,000 pieces of small hardware products using waste materials in May.
    The production of small commodities in the urban people's communes of Xining City has received strong support and assistance from the city's commercial departments. In addition to helping commune-run industries solve some production funds and raw materials, the Department Store Local Industrial Products Department of the Commercial Bureau has also specially established a "Clothing, Shoes, and Hats Sample Room" and a Clothing and Hat Innovation Research Group, and sent people to Beijing and Tianjin to select more than 500 samples, extensively absorbing consumer opinions, researching and finalizing promotion, and helping commune-run industries improve the production technology and product quality of small commodities.

    建立生产体系　广辟材料来源　大搞技术革新
    南京城市公社有计划发展小商品生产
    西宁城市人民公社广泛利用废旧材料增产小商品
    本报讯　南京市随着城市人民公社的建立，日用小商品生产蓬勃发展。今年上半年，商业系统的收购值为二千五百多万元，比去年同期增长76％。今年第二季度比第一季度又有所增长。最近各公社对以前分散经营，品种不稳的生产小组，进行了人力、设备、厂房等统一调整，建立了专业厂，建立了原材料生产基地，保证了货源上市，进一步满足了人民生活需要。
    南京市各公社的小商品生产，是随着街道工业的发展而发展起来的，它的产量在三千个街道工业生产单位中占60％。今年5月，南京市委先后召开了两次会议，研究了小商品生产情况。指出了当前人民生活中，对日用小商品有日益增多的需求，而少数的管理干部和基层干部对此还认识不足。市委批判了少数干部认为小商品产值小、利润少、费工大、麻烦多的错误认识，指出必须从满足人民生活需要出发，大力发展小商品生产，接着各公社就对产品、产量、设备、人力等进行了摸底排队，将同类行业编成组，建立了有组织的专业的生产体系。在组织领导上，市专门成立了小商品生产办公室，各公社也有一个局专管，并采取了定厂、定任务、定设备、定劳力、定产品、定产量、定质量的七定办法，使小商品生产计划落实到厂、车间、小组、个人，确保计划的完成。现在，全市定出小商品生产专业厂二百五十九个，职工一万多人，品种两千八百多种，其中新增的理发机、钢板等从前未生产过的新品种三百八十多种。这些厂的生产能力，已能基本满足全市人民生活需要。此外全市还有二千多个街道小组，也生产日用小商品。
    原材料的供应，是小商品生产中的重要一环，城市公社工业兴办以前，兼营小商品生产的大厂或一些零散小商品生产合作社、组，他们原材料的来源，基本上依靠上级调拨和外出采购。公社工业办起来以后，依靠调拨采购已不能满足需要，而公社工业类多、面广、遍布全市，易于挖掘原材料的潜力。各公社便采取了综合利用，节约用材，制造代用品，清仓收旧，相互协作等办法解决。鼓楼公社三牌楼分社卫生用具厂，原先由于原材料不足，使生产完不成计划，后来与南京被服厂协作利用被服厂的下脚料（碎布条），提前完成了计划。南京制本厂生产弹簧夹缺乏铁皮，于是四处清仓“觅宝”，结果利用罐头盒，使生产任务超额完成。建业公社飞跃工具厂制造锉刀缺乏中炭钢，他们自力更生，用次铁浇钢渗炭代用，既解决了困难，也节约了钢材和煤炭。建业公社先锋五金厂，用白口铁代替灰口铁制电灯开关铁壳。白下公社竞赛五金厂，完全以铁代铜制造锁心，以及利用回收的几百吨钢材制造小五金用品都很能解决问题。此外，全市各公社还专门建立了原材料生产基地，共十八个厂，生产烤胶、人造纤维板、三酸（硫酸、盐酸、硝酸）两碱（烧碱、纯碱）芒硝等百十种原材料产品。各公社还建立了淘炼厂，大批利用大厂的工业垃圾（碎屑），也部分满足了有色和黑色金属的需要。
    公社工业办起来以后，小商品生产的协作网建立以后，产品的花色品种，日益繁多，技术革新、技术协作也迅速开展。南京火炬袜厂，过去只能生产十来种粗纱线袜，公社化后，领导组织协作，学习先进，现在已能生产一百多个品种的高级细纱袜子。秦淮公社夫子庙地区，过去九个分散小组，只能生产三个品种，现在组织起来以后已增加到五十三个品种。鼓楼公社红五月竹器厂，过去一直手工劈篾，生产总不能提高，后来在公社领导下，学习同类行业的先进经验，制成了劈篾机，一下提高工效三十多倍。
    过去传统手工精制的工艺美术品，公社化后，大闹品种、技术革新，今年1至5月，增加的新品种达八百一十四项，相当去年全年的生产项目。现在生产中机械操作的比重已占22.1％，革新项目有二百多种。单机绣机的革新，一人就能做原来十八人的活。鼓楼公社过去有些工厂，因设备、材料、劳力不足而被挤掉的一百六十四个品种，现在不仅全部恢复了生产，而且还增加了一百七十五个品种。痱子粉、草帽、澡盆、拖鞋等夏令用品，已陆续上市。
    目前有些公社还开展了一个以价廉物美、品种繁多、供应及时的大竞赛，进一步增产小商品生产，满足人民日益增长的生活需要。
    本报讯　青海省西宁市城市人民公社的社办工业，积极为居民生活、为市场供应服务，大力进行小商品生产。仅东关人民公社的服装厂和制鞋厂，在5月份就生产了各种服装五万多件，鞋五千多双。全市的小商品供应量和库存量都有了显著增加。
    在小商品生产中，各社办工厂都根据自力更生的原则，充分利用废旧材料，解决原料、材料问题。城中区人民公社五金厂，从4月份到现在，利用废铁和破罐头盒等，生产了大批水罐、铁勺和菜刀。东关人民公社的五金厂5月份利用废料、旧料生产的小五金制品，就有九千多件。
    西宁市城市人民公社的小商品生产，得到了市商业部门的有力支持和帮助。除了帮助社办工业解决部分生产资金和原材料外，商业局百货地方工业产品门市部还专门成立了“服装鞋帽样品间”、衣帽革新研究小组，派人到北京，天津选购五百多种样品，广泛吸收消费者的意见，研究定型推广，帮助社办工业提高小商品的生产技术和产品质量。（附图片）
