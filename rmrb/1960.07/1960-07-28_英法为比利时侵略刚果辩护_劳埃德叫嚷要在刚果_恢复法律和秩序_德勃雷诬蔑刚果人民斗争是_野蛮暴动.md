Xinhua News Agency, London, July 25th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in a speech in the House of Commons today, indicated that the British government intends to continue using United Nations forces to replace Belgian troops in suppressing the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle, and plans to help the Belgian aggressor troops remain in the Congo for a long time.

When a member of parliament asked Lloyd whether the United Nations Security Council's policy considered that Belgian troops should be completely withdrawn from the Congo, Lloyd replied that he believed that the "primary task" now is to "restore law and order" in the Congo, and it would be best to concentrate "all attention" on this "primary task." As for whether the Belgian troops should withdraw from their bases in the Congo, that is a matter for the two countries.

Lloyd also said that he believed that Belgian troops should only withdraw from those areas in the Congo where the United Nations has established "law and order," "and not based on the slim chance that they (the United Nations) might be able to do this throughout the country."

Lloyd emphasized that the actions of a large number of United Nations troops in the Congo are having a "calming effect" on the local residents.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Paris dispatch: French Prime Minister Debré, in a foreign policy statement to the French National Assembly yesterday, once again exposed the ugly face of French colonialism. He blatantly clamored that Belgium "has the right" to send troops to the Congo.

Debré slandered the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against the colonialists, describing this struggle as a "barbaric riot that caused shameful incidents in many places," while defending the actions of Belgium and other members of the North Atlantic bloc led by the United States in the Congo, and opposing accusations that they were aggressing against the Congo.

Debré expressed his approval of the United Nations' intervention in the Congo. He made no secret of France's intention to meddle in the Congo. He said that France is prepared to make "contributions" to the Congo in terms of "providing wise and resolute assistance."

This French Prime Minister also attempted to use the beautiful signboard of so-called "maintaining peace" as a cover to bind and threaten the enslaved African people from opposing the bloody rule of the colonialists. He said that world peace is "indivisible," and therefore, Africa in particular must seize every opportunity to demonstrate the "value" of its "ties" with other continents - especially the European continent.

He demanded that the major Western powers adopt a "common policy" on "major world issues," and not be "united here and divided there."

    英法为比利时侵略刚果辩护
    劳埃德叫嚷要在刚果“恢复法律和秩序”
    德勃雷诬蔑刚果人民斗争是“野蛮暴动”
    新华社伦敦25日电　英国外交大臣劳埃德今天在下院发表的讲话中表明，英国政府要继续利用联合国军队来代替比利时军队以镇压刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争，并且打算帮助比利时侵略军长期在刚果赖下去。
    有议员问劳埃德，联合国安全理事会的政策是否认为比利时军队应该全部撤出刚果。劳埃德回答说，他认为，现在“首要的任务”是在刚果“恢复法律和秩序”，最好是“把全部注意力”集中在这个“首要任务”上。至于比利时军队是否要从它在刚果的基地撤走的问题，那是它们两国的事。
    劳埃德还说，他认为，比利时军队只应当从联合国在刚果建立了“法律和秩序”的那些地方撤退，“而不是根据他们（联合国方面）可能会在（刚果）全国各地做到这一点这种不大的可能性而撤退”。
    劳埃德强调，大批联合国军队在刚果的行动正在对当地居民起一种“镇静作用”。
    新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理德勃雷昨天向法国国民议会提出的一份外交政策声明中再一次暴露出法国殖民主义者的嘴脸。他公然叫嚷说，比利时“有权”派遣军队到刚果去。
    德勃雷诬蔑刚果人民反对殖民者的爱国正义斗争，把这种斗争说成是“在许多地方造成可耻事件的野蛮暴动”，同时却为比利时和以美国为首的北大西洋集团其他成员国在刚果的行动辩护，反对指责它们侵略刚果。
    德勃雷表示赞成联合国干涉刚果。他毫不隐讳，法国企图插足刚果。他说，法国准备在刚果对“提供明智和果敢的援助”方面，作出“贡献”。
    这位法国总理还企图用所谓“维护和平”的漂亮招牌作掩护，来束缚和威胁被奴役的非洲人民不得反对殖民主义者的血腥统治。他说，世界和平是“不可分割的”，因此，特别是非洲必须抓住每一个机会来表明它同其他大陆——特别是欧洲大陆——“联系”的“价值”。
    他要求西方各大国在“世界重大问题”上采取“共同的政策”，而不要“在这里团结一致，在那里又有分歧”。
