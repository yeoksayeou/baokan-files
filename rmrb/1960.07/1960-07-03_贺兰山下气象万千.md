A Myriad of New Scenes Below the Helan Mountains
By Our Correspondent

As the saying goes, seeing is believing. People call the Ningxia Yellow River Plain the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall," and as soon as we arrived, we felt this title was well-deserved. Look, the boundless fertile land stretches to the horizon, the Yellow River flows from south to north, rushing thousands of miles across the plain, with canals crisscrossing the banks like spiderwebs; the towering Helan Mountains extend along the west of the plain, forming a natural barrier against wind and sand. Not long ago, we took a short trip along the foothills of the Helan Mountains. Here, we do not want to use more words to talk about the uniquely endowed land of fish and rice on the plain, but just narrate what we saw and heard on the vast desert at the foot of the Helan Mountains.

Asking for Grain from White Alkali Soil

The work of transforming barren land - white alkali soil - has entered its third year.

With joyful hearts, we departed from Yinchuan, the capital of the autonomous region, and drove straight to the saline-alkali soil improvement experimental station, which had created a miracle in conquering white alkali soil. We visited this place at the end of May last year. At that time, the researchers at the experimental station were busy sowing rice on a little over one mu of white alkali soil. Now, what attracts us is a patch of tender green wheat seedlings - the experiment of planting dryland crops on white alkali soil has begun. The researchers seemed to talk very little about this important experience, overshadowed by another more exciting event. This is the news just brought by Yan Bingshen, director of the Soil and Fertilizer Department of the Agricultural Science Institute of the Autonomous Region: the nearby Qianjin Commune has decided to develop white alkali soil on a large scale. The young technician Ke Qiaozhi repeatedly said: "This is a great event! I originally thought that it would take a year or two to expand the experimental results and promote them into production. Now, the people's commune has given me a tap on the head. I really didn't expect it to be so fast!"

Indeed, in our era, there are many things that are unexpected. Take white alkali soil as an example. It is distributed in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other regions. In the Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area alone, there are more than 700,000 mu, accounting for 8% of the cultivated land and arable land in the irrigation area. White alkali soil is a white, hard, alkalized soil with a smooth surface and a cracked appearance. When dry, the ground is like cement, so hard that it cannot be plowed; when wet, it becomes thin mud. This kind of land is barren, and people call it "barren land." How to transform this soil? No data on past successful improvements could be found. After the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, the staff of the Ningxia Saline-Alkali Soil Improvement Experimental Station boldly tried to grow rice on white alkali soil and succeeded that year, ending the history of white alkali soil being unusable. Now, the people's commune has advanced the battle to conquer white alkali soil from small-scale trial planting to a new stage of large-scale development.

Good News from the "Hometown of Tan Sheep"

We arrived at Hongguangying in Helan County at dusk. The Helan Mountains were green, set against the brocade-like red clouds. On the vast grassland at the foot of the mountain, the shepherds returning late, draped in old sheepskin coats, were herding the sheep. This is the "hometown of Tan sheep."

You must be familiar with Tan sheep fur. In many places, department store windows display this precious fur. Its beautiful patterns, glossy white color, nine-bend hair tufts, and soft wool fibers have attracted many customers! Tan sheep are produced in Ningxia, and legend has it that Hongguangying is its birthplace. When we arrived, it was the season of great harvest for Tan sheep. The grassland seemed particularly busy. Every day before dawn, the sheepfolds were brightly lit, and the shepherds carefully fed milk to the lambs and added feed to the ewes. During the day, the grassland became a lambing ground. The shepherds carried lambing felt bags, delivering one lamb after another. The good news of the harvest spread from one flock to another. At night, they slept next to the sheepfolds, guarding against wolves.

In the past, there was a saying in pastoral areas: "Fat in autumn, thin in winter, death in spring." This time, we went to several brigades in Hongguangying, and saw that the lambs were all heavy, and most of the ewes were also fat and strong, with few cases of weakness. When we asked the reason, one "sheep expert" said: "It's all thanks to the people's commune!" This is the truth. In the first year after communization, Changxin Commune, where Hongguangying is located, saw a net increase of more than 40% in Tan sheep. In order to develop this precious breed of Tan sheep, from the commune and brigade to the production team, the commune chairman and team leader were assigned to manage the sheep; the commune also selected "sheep experts" with many years of grazing experience to specially manage Tan sheep; the commune and brigade established sheep farms, selected purebred Tan sheep for further breeding and improvement, and trained a large number of lambing staff. What we saw and heard in Hongguangying made us believe that communization has put the development of Tan sheep on a broader path.

Adding a Giant Dragon to the Plain

We drove across the desert stretching to the end of the sky. The farther we went, the more vast the wilderness became, as if we were on a small boat sailing on a boundless ocean. After we arrived at Pingjibao, we saw a new canal stretching straight to the foot of the Helan Mountains like a giant dragon. This is the simple Xigan Main Canal, which was excavated in just two months last winter by more than 40,000 commune members. It starts from Qingtongxia on the Yellow River, extends north along the eastern foot of the Helan Mountains, and ends at Zhenbeibao in Helan County.

Last winter, when the news of excavating the Xigan Canal at the foot of the Helan Mountains spread, thousands of people eagerly signed up, requesting to participate in this grand socialist construction project. Ren Yi, an old man in his sixties who had suffered from drought, repeatedly requested that his whole family be allowed to build the canal so that his lifelong wish could be fulfilled. The cadres repeatedly explained to him, asking him to stay at home to engage in other production, and only let his son participate in the canal construction. Afterwards, he was still uneasy and made a special trip to the construction site, repeatedly urging his son: "Be sure to get the canal open before you go home. This is a major event that our ancestors have been waiting for!"

At that time, it was early winter, and the water was freezing at the foot of the Helan Mountains, with strong winds blowing constantly. However, the more than 40,000 commune members who were digging the canal persisted in construction day and night, and as a result, the 14.5-meter-wide and 91.7-kilometer-long canal was completed half a month ahead of schedule. This is a miracle created by the heroic Hui and Han commune members under the strong leadership of the Party.

With the completion of the Xigan Canal, the "Great Northern Wilderness" at the foot of the Helan Mountains will become a prosperous granary. Now, a state-owned farm has been established on the barren beach of Pingjibao. Ninety percent of the cadres who built this farm are demobilized soldiers, including veterans of the Red Army, veterans of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and more than a dozen heroic soldiers who came from the Great Northern Wilderness to provide support. When we arrived at Pingjibao Farm, more than 90,000 mu of virgin land had been reclaimed and sown with the seeds of a bumper harvest, and in some places the wheat seedlings were already a green patch.

    贺兰山下气象万千
    本报记者
    俗话说，百闻不如一见。人们都把宁夏黄河平原叫作“塞上江南”，我们一到这里，就觉得这个称号名不虚传。你看，八百里沃野远连天际，黄河从南到北，一泻千里纵贯平原，两岸渠道纵横，密似蛛网；高接云表的贺兰山绵延在平原的西部，成为防止风沙的天然屏障。不久以前，我们沿着贺兰山麓作了一次短暂的旅行。这里，我们不想用更多的话去讲平原上那些得天独厚的鱼米之乡，只是叙述一下我们在贺兰山麓大片荒漠上的所见所闻。
    向白僵土要粮
    改造不毛之地——白僵土的工作，跨入了第三个年头。
    我们怀着愉快的心情，从自治区首府——银川出发，驱车直奔创造了征服白僵土奇迹的盐碱土改良试验站。去年5月底我们访问过这个地方，那时，试验站的研究人员正忙忙碌碌地在一亩多白僵土上播种水稻，而此刻吸引我们的却是一片嫩绿的麦苗——白僵土上种植旱作物的试验开始了。对于这项重要的经验，研究人员似乎谈的很少，被另一件更加激动人心的事所掩盖。这就是自治区农业科学研究所土肥系主任阎炳申刚刚带来的消息：附近的前进公社决定大面积开发白僵土。年青的技术员柯翘智反复说：“这可是件了不起的大事！原来以为要扩大试验成果，推行到生产中去，不是一年两年能办到的事，这一下，人民公社敲了敲我的脑袋，真想不到会这样快！”
    确实，在我们时代，想不到的事儿很多。就拿白僵土来说，它分布在宁夏、内蒙古、新疆等地区，仅宁夏黄河灌区就有七十多万亩，占灌区耕地和可耕地面积8％。白僵土是一种白色坚硬的碱化土壤，表面平滑，呈龟裂状。干燥时，地面像水泥，坚硬得不能下犁；阴湿时，又变为稀泥。这种土地寸草不生，人们都称为“不毛之地”。如何改造这种土壤，找不出过去的改良成功的资料。1958年大跃进开始后，宁夏盐碱土壤改良试验站的工作人员，大胆的在白僵土上试种水稻，当年就获得成功，结束了白僵土不能开发利用的历史。现在，人民公社又把征服白僵土的战斗，从小面积的试种推进到大面积开发的新阶段。
    “滩羊家乡”传喜讯
    我们到达贺兰县洪广营，已是傍晚时分，贺兰山一片青色，衬在锦缎般的红霞上。山下一望无际的草原上，晚归的牧工，肩搭老羊皮袄，?喝着羊群，这就是“滩羊的家乡”。
    对于滩羊毛皮，你是不会陌生的。很多地方的百货公司的橱窗里，都摆着这种名贵的毛皮。它那美观的花纹、光润洁白的毛色、九道弯的毛穗、柔软的绒维，曾经吸引过多少顾客！滩羊就产于宁夏、传说洪广营又是它的发源地。我们到这里的时候，正是滩羊大丰收的季节。草原显得格外忙碌。每天天不亮，羊圈里已是灯光闪烁，牧工们精心地给羔羊配奶，给母羊加料。白天，草原成了产羔场，牧工们背着接羔毡包，接好一个又接一个，丰收的喜讯从这个羊群传到那个羊群。夜晚，他们又睡在羊圈旁边，警戒狼害。
    过去，在牧区流传着一句话：“秋肥、冬瘦、春死亡”。这次我们在洪广营去了好几个大队，看到的羔羊都是重甸甸的，母羊也大多腰肥体壮，很少有乏瘦现象。我们询问其原因，有一位“羊把式”说：“都是沾人民公社的光！”这是一句实话。洪广营所在的常信公社，在公社化后的第一年，滩羊就净增40％以上。为了发展滩羊这一名贵的品种，从公社、大队到生产队都固定了专管羊只的社长和队长；公社还从牧工中挑选了有多年放牧经验的“羊把式”专管滩羊；公社和大队建立了羊场，选择纯种滩羊，进一步培育提高，还训练了大批接羔员。我们在洪广营的所见所闻，使人相信，公社化使滩羊的发展走上了一条更加宽阔的道路。
    平原添巨龙
    我们驱车奔驰在伸到天底的荒漠上，越走荒原越辽阔，好像乘上了小艇，航行在浩瀚无际的重洋。我们到达平吉堡后，只见有一条新渠道，像一条巨龙直伸贺兰山下。这就是去年冬季，四万多名公社社员只用了二个月时间开挖出来的西干总渠简易渠道。它从黄河青铜峡起，沿贺兰山东麓向北伸展，直到贺兰县镇北堡。
    去年冬天，要在贺兰山下开挖西干渠的消息传出时，成千上万的人争先报名，要求参加这一宏伟的社会主义建设工程。饱经干旱苦楚的六十多岁的任义老大爷，再三要求说，让他们全家人都去修渠，才能使他这一辈子的心事如愿。干部一再给他解释，让他留在家搞别的生产，只让他的儿子参加了修渠。事后他还不放心，特地跑到工地上，再三地嘱咐他的儿子说：“一定要把渠修通再回家，这是我们祖祖辈辈盼望的大事啊！”
    那时，正是初冬的天气，贺兰山下已是滴水成冰，狂风吹个不停。但是挖渠的四万多名社员，整日坚持施工，结果按计划提前半个月就把这条宽十四点五米，长九十一点七公里的渠道修通了。这是英雄的回、汉族社员在党的坚强领导下创造的奇迹。
    随着西干渠的建成，贺兰山下的“北大荒”将变成一个富庶的粮仓。现在平吉堡荒滩上，已经建立了一座国营农场。建设这个农场的干部90％是转业军人，其中有老红军，抗日战争时期的老战士，还有从北大荒前来支援的十几名英雄战士。当我们到达平吉堡农场时，九万多亩处女地已被开垦，播下了丰收的种子，有些地方麦苗已是绿油油的一片。（附图片）
