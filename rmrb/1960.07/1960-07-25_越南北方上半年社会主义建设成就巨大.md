In stark contrast to the miserable state of economic stagnation in South Vietnam
Great Achievements in Socialist Construction in Northern Vietnam in the First Half of the Year
Industrial production surpasses the level of the same period last year; agricultural cooperativization is in good condition; socialist transformation achieves new progress

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 24th: According to the person in charge of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, speaking to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved remarkable results in implementing the first half of 1960 national plan.

The person in charge said that in terms of socialist transformation, new progress has been made in the first half of this year. He pointed out that the socialist transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed. 98% of workers have been liberated from capitalist relations of production. 68% of professional handicraftsmen in North Vietnam have joined various cooperative organizations. 50% of small vendors have joined various cooperative organizations.

He said that as of June 1st, nearly 34,000 agricultural cooperatives had been established in North Vietnam, with member households accounting for 55% of the total number of laboring farmers. The situation of the agricultural cooperativization movement is generally good. The unit area yield and income of cooperative members are generally higher than those of individual farmers.

He said that the industrial production results in the first half of this year exceeded those of the same period in the past. The total output value of state-owned industries in the first half of the year exceeded the original plan by 1%, an increase of 30.8% compared with the same period in 1959. Among them, the production of means of production completed 99% of the plan for the first half of the year, reaching 49% of the annual plan, an increase of 37% compared with the same period in 1959. The production of consumer goods exceeded the original plan by 3.7%, completing 49% of the annual plan, an increase of 26% compared with the same period in 1959. Local industries have completed 76% of the annual plan. Many places have established small blast furnaces, and the quality of pig iron produced is quite good, which has solved the local supply of pig iron to a certain extent.

He said that the amount of capital construction in the first half of this year increased by 50% compared with the same period last year, exceeding the amount of construction for the entire year of 1958. Currently, sixteen important projects have been completed or basically completed, including chromite mines, oil extraction plants, rubber factories, sugar factories, power generation boilers, battery factories, brick factories, water plants, etc. The construction speed of key projects such as the Dong Anh-Thai Nguyen railway line is quite fast.

When talking about the achievements in transportation, postal and telecommunications, he said that the transportation department has proposed many technical innovation measures. The annual freight plan has been completed 48.2%, exceeding the plan for the first half of the year by 8%, an increase of 31% compared with the same period last year. Postal and telecommunications work has completed 51% of the annual plan.

When talking about agricultural production in the first half of this year, he said that this year's climate was very unfavorable for agricultural production, but this year's total summer rice output was only 70,000 tons less than in 1958, which is much better than before the war. He pointed out that under this year's severe natural disasters, it is welcome that Vietnamese farmers were able to achieve such results.

When talking about the situation in culture and education, he said that this year, ordinary schools, technical schools, and universities at all levels have strengthened socialist ideological education and implemented the combination of learning and labor, so the students have made rapid progress.

While describing the great achievements made by North Vietnam in socialist transformation and socialist construction to reporters, he also pointed out that under the rule of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem group, the economy of South Vietnam is increasingly trapped in a difficult, turbulent, and stagnant situation.

He said that agricultural production in South Vietnam has stagnated. From 1957 to the present, the yield per hectare is still 1.3 tons. The rice planting area in many provinces has been greatly reduced. This is the result of the US-Ngo group's implementation of persecution and massacre policies and the policy of concentrating people in "agglomeration zones." Therefore, agricultural production in My Tho, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Rach Gia, Can Tho, Phuoc Long and the fifth interzone in South Vietnam has suffered consecutive years of crop failure.

He said that the textile industry in South Vietnam has been in a state of stagnation. According to South Vietnam's "Commercial Weekly" on April 24 this year, many people engaged in the textile industry had to change careers due to insufficient supply of raw materials. The handmade sugar industry has been continuously squeezed out. Hundreds of sugar furnaces in Long An province have been forced to shut down, and tens of thousands of sugarcane farmers in Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces have had to sell their products at low prices because they could not withstand the squeeze.

He said that South Vietnam's trade deficit reached 30% to 40%. The main imports are consumer goods. The domestic commercial market presents a chaotic scene, speculation prevails, and prices fluctuate erratically. In April this year, the price of rice reached 550 to 600 yuan per 100 kilograms, while it was 350 to 400 yuan in the same period last year.

He pointed out that South Vietnam's economy is serving military purposes. At the same time, foreign capital, especially American capital, is massively infiltrating South Vietnam. He pointed out that the people of South Vietnam have clearly seen the essence of US imperialism and its lackeys, and are therefore carrying out a more resolute struggle for the rapid realization of the reunification of the motherland and for a free life.

    同越南南方经济陷于停滞的惨状形成鲜明对照
    越南北方上半年社会主义建设成就巨大
    工业生产超过去年同期水平  农业合作化情况良好  社会主义改造获新进展
    新华社河内24日电　据越南民主共和国国家计划委员会负责人今天对新华社记者说，越南民主共和国在执行1960年上半年国家计划中取得了可观的成就。
    这位负责人说，在社会主义改造方面，今年上半年取得了新的进展。他指出，对私人资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成。从资本主义生产关系中解放出来的工人已达98％。越南北方的专业手工业者已有68％参加各种合作组织。小商贩参加各种合作组织的已占小商贩总数的50％。
    他说，截至6月1日为止，越南北方建立了近三万四千个农业社，入社农户占劳动农民总户数的55％。农业合作化运动的情况基本上是良好的。农业社的单位面积产量和社员收入一般都比单干户高。
    他说，今年上半年的工业生产成绩超过了过去同一时期。上半年国营工业总产值超过原计划1％，比1959年同期增长30.8％，其中生产资料的生产完成了上半年计划的99％，达到全年计划的49％，比1959年同期增长37％。消费资料的生产超过原计划3.7％，完成全年计划的49％，比1959年同期增长26％。地方工业已经完成全年计划的76％。许多地方建立了小高炉，生产的生铁质量相当好，在一定程度上解决了当地生铁的供应问题。
    他说，今年上半年的基本建设工程量比去年同期增长50％，超过1958年全年的工程量。目前已有十六个重要工程完成或基本完成，其中包括铬铁矿、榨油厂、橡胶厂、制糖厂、发电汽锅炉、电池厂、砖瓦厂、自来水厂等。东英—太原铁路线等重点工程的施工速度相当快。
    他在谈到交通邮电方面的成绩时说，运输部门已经提出了许多技术革新措施。全年货运计划已完成48.2％，超额8％完成了上半年计划，比去年同期增长了31％。邮电工作完成了全年计划的51％。
    他在谈到今年上半年的农业生产时说，今年的气候非常不利于农业生产，但今年夏稻总产量比1958年只差七万吨，比战前要好得多。他指出，在今年严重的天灾下，越南农民能够取得这样的成绩，是值得欢迎的。
    他在谈到文化教育方面的情况时说，今年各级普通学校、技术学校和大学加强了社会主义思想教育，实行学习和劳动相结合，因此学生们的进步很快。
    他在向记者叙述了越南北方在社会主义改造和社会主义建设方面取得的巨大成就的同时还指出，在美国—吴庭艳集团统治下的越南南方的经济越来越陷于困难、动荡和停滞的绝境。
    他说，越南南方的农业生产停步不前，从1957年到现在，每公顷的产量仍然是一点三吨。许多省份的稻谷种植面积大大缩小，这是由于美吴集团执行迫害和屠杀政策以及把人民集中到“稠密区”的政策的结果。因此越南南方的美萩、槟椥、永隆、迪石、芹苴、福隆等省和第五联区的农业生产连年失收。
    他说，越南南方的纺织业一直陷于停顿。据越南南方的“商业周刊”今年4月24日透露，许多从事纺织业的人由于原料供应不足而不得不改行。手工制糖业一直受到排挤，龙安省成百个糖炉被迫停产，广义省和广南省成万名蔗农由于经受不起排挤而不得不低价出售产品。
    他说，越南南方的对外贸易的入超达到30％到40％。进口的主要是消费品。国内商业市场呈现一片混乱，投机之风盛行，物价起落无常。今年4月间米价每百公斤达到五百五十元至六百元，而去年同期是三百五十元到四百元。
    他指出，越南南方的经济是为军事目的服务的。同时，外国资本特别是美国资本大量渗入越南南方。他指出，越南南方人民已经清楚地看到美帝国主义及其走狗的本质，从而为迅速实现祖国的统一、为争取自由的生活而进行更坚决的斗争。
