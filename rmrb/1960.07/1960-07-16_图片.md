    The "Meteor," the largest hydrofoil made in the Soviet Union. It can accommodate one hundred and fifty passengers and has a maximum speed of eighty kilometers per hour. It is larger than the first Soviet hydrofoil, the "Raketa," made in 1957. The first American hydrofoil is expected to be launched by the end of this year.
    A hydrofoil has small underwater wings under the hull. When the ship is traveling at high speed, the force of the water acting on the wings lifts the entire hull out of the water, reducing the contact area between the ship and the water, thus greatly facilitating the increase of the ship's speed.
     The "Meteor" hydrofoil was designed under the leadership of young engineer Alekseyev and manufactured by the "Krasnoye Sormovo" factory.

    苏联制成的世界上最大的“流星号”水翼船。它能容纳一百五十位乘客，最大的时速是八十公里，比1957年苏联制的第一艘水翼船“火箭号”大；而美国的第一艘水翼船预计在今年年底才能下水。
    水翼船的船身下有不大的水下翼，船在高速行驶时，由于水作用于翼的力量，使整个船身露在水面上，船和水的接触面减小，因而大大有利于提高船速。
     “流星号”水翼船是在青年工程师阿列克谢耶夫领导下设计，由“红色索尔莫沃”工厂制造的。
