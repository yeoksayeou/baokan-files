　　The Heinous Crimes of US Imperialism in South Vietnam Over the Past Six Years
    For six years, US imperialism has blatantly violated the Geneva Accords, intensified its control over South Vietnam militarily, politically, and economically, turning it into a dark hell where US imperialism and its lackey Ngo Dinh Diem clique enslave, exploit, persecute, and massacre the people. It has also become a military base for their provocative activities and the creation of tension in Indochina and Asia.
    US imperialism has undermined the Geneva Accords by sending large numbers of military personnel into South Vietnam. The US "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam has increased from 200 at the time of the Indochina armistice to 2,000, including 280 officers of field grade or higher. This military organization, which includes departments such as the Army, Air Force, Navy, combat training, logistics, intelligence, supervision, and supply, is even larger than Ngo Dinh Diem's Ministry of Defense. Its military personnel are distributed from Ngo Dinh Diem's Ministry of Defense, General Staff Headquarters, and the various service commands of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, down to military regions, divisions, regiments, military schools, military construction sites, and warehouses. It closely controls Ngo Dinh Diem's small court and its army, and has in effect become the "supreme emperor" commanding the Ngo Dinh Diem American clique.
    In order to step up its military plans, US imperialism had sent as many as 68 US delegations composed of senior US civilian and military officials to South Vietnam by May 1960.
    US military personnel not only run rampant in South Vietnam, raping women and beating workers, but also participate in "military sweeps," directly commanding the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to massacre and persecute patriotic people. From the armistice to April of this year, 230,000 people in South Vietnam have been arrested and imprisoned in jails and concentration camps by the US-Ngo clique, 14,800 have been killed or gone missing, and 16,625 have been tortured or wounded by bullets during "sweeps." There is not a single remote village in South Vietnam that has not suffered from the terror of "sweeps."
    In order to persecute the people, the US-Ngo clique has set up large and small prisons and concentration camps in the cities, countryside, mountains, forests, and islands of South Vietnam. Currently, there are eight large concentration camps and 320 medium and small concentration camps in South Vietnam (not including those below the county level). On average, one in every three families in South Vietnam has a family member who has been brutally persecuted, and one in every ten people has been arrested and tortured by the US-Ngo clique. Currently, the US-Ngo clique is stepping up the establishment of so-called "densified areas," which are essentially disguised concentration camps, in order to more closely control the people of South Vietnam.
    Under the instructions of US military personnel, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique frantically expanded its army and forcibly conscripted young people. South Vietnam currently has a population of 12 million, while its standing armed forces have been expanded to 355,000.
    At the same time, US imperialism secretly transports large quantities of military supplies into South Vietnam to equip these armies. According to incomplete statistics, since 1954, the total value of US weapons and military supplies transported to South Vietnam has reached US$424,282,000. It is worth noting that the United States is plotting to equip the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons and rockets. In April last year, the United States signed a so-called "cooperation agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy" with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has already sent officers to the United States or US military bases for training in the use of atomic weapons and rockets.
    In order to realize its conspiracy of expanding its army and preparing for war, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's military expenditure in 1960 accounted for 84.71% of the total fiscal budget.
    US imperialism also plunders South Vietnam's economy on a large scale. Under the guise of so-called "aid," it dumps large quantities of surplus materials into South Vietnam, causing serious damage to South Vietnam's national economy, and industry, handicrafts, and commerce are heading towards stagnation and bankruptcy.
    The lives of the working people of South Vietnam are increasingly mired in misery. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people has reached 1.5 million, including 700,000 in Saigon-Cholon alone. Due to the extreme poverty of the people, epidemics are rampant. In South Vietnam, 60,000 people die from lung disease alone each year. Due to poverty, disease, and debt, the number of suicides is also increasing.
    The heinous crimes of US imperialism have aroused the boundless anger of the Vietnamese people. Recently, people in various parts of North Vietnam have held magnificent demonstrations against US imperialism. The people of South Vietnam are also unwilling to endure the brutal suppression of the US-Ngo clique and have launched a storm of struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs. The Vietnamese people will surely drive US imperialism out of their beautiful homeland.

### 美帝国主义六年来在越南南方的滔天罪行

　　美帝国主义六年来在越南南方的滔天罪行
    六年来，美帝国主义明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议，在军事、政治和经济上加紧控制南越，把南越变成了美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团用以奴役、压榨、迫害和屠杀人民的阴暗的地狱，并且成为它们在印度支那和亚洲进行挑衅活动和制造紧张局势的军事基地。
    美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议，派遣大批军事人员进入南越。美国在南越的“军事援助顾问团”已经由印度支那停战时的二百人增加到了二千人，其中仅校级军官就有二百八十名之多。这个包括陆军、空军、海军、作战训练、后勤、情报、监察、供应等部门的军事机构，甚至比吴庭艳的国防部还要庞大。它的军事人员分布到上至吴庭艳的国防部、总参谋部、陆、海、空军等各军种司令部，下至军区、师、团、军事学校、军事工地、仓库等。它严密地控制着吴庭艳的小朝廷和它的军队，实际上成为指挥吴庭艳美国集团的“太上皇”。
    美帝国主义为了加紧推行它的军事计划，到1960年5月为止，派到南越活动的由美国高级文武官员组成的美国代表团达六十八个之多。
    美国军事人员不仅在南越横行霸道，强奸妇女，殴打工人，而且参加“军事扫荡”，直接指挥吴庭艳集团屠杀和迫害爱国人民。自停战以来到今年4月，在南越已经有二十三万人被美吴集团逮捕关入监牢和集中营里，有一万四千八百人被杀害或失踪，有一万六千六百二十五人在“扫荡”中被拷打或中弹负伤。在南越没有任何一个偏僻的村庄没有遭受到恐怖的“扫荡”。
    美吴集团为了迫害人民，在南越城、乡、深山和密林中以及海岛上遍设大、小监狱和集中营。目前在南越有大集中营八个，中、小集中营三百二十个（不包括县以下的）。南越平均每三个家庭就有一个家庭中有人惨遭迫害，平均每十个人就有一个人受到美吴集团的逮捕和拷打。目前，美吴集团正在加紧建立实质上是变相集中营的所谓“稠密区”，以便更加严密地控制南越人民。
    在美国军事人员的指使下，吴庭艳集团疯狂地扩充军队，强征青年入伍。南越目前的人口一千二百万，而它的常备武装部队已扩充到三十五万五千人。
    同时，美帝国主义偷偷地把大量的军用物资运入南越来装备这些军队。据不完全的统计，从1954年以来，运入南越的美国武器和军事物资总值已达四亿二千四百二十八万二千美元。值得注意的是，美国正阴谋以原子武器和火箭来装备南越军队。在去年4月，美国同吴庭艳集团签订了一项所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”。吴庭艳集团已经派遣军官到美国或美国的军事基地进行使用原子武器和火箭的训练。
    美吴集团为实现其扩军备战的阴谋，1960年南越军费开支竟占全部财政预算的84.71％。
    美帝国主义还对南越的经济大肆掠夺，在所谓“援助”的幌子下，把大量剩余物资向南越倾销，使南越的民族经济遭到严重的摧残，工业、手工业和商业走向停滞和破产。
    南越劳动人民的生活日益陷入水深火热之中，失业半失业人口已达一百五十万，仅西贡—堤岸市就有七十万人。由于人民生活极度贫困，疫疠横行，南越每年仅死于肺病的人就有六万。由于贫困、疾病和债务逼人，自杀的人也越来越多。
    美帝国主义的滔天罪行激起了越南人民的无比愤怒。越南北方各地人民最近纷纷举行了气势磅礴的反对美帝国主义的示威集会。越南南方人民也不愿美吴集团的残酷镇压，掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴。越南人民一定要把美帝国主义赶出自己美丽的国土。
