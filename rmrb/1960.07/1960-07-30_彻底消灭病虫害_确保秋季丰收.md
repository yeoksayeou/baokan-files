Thoroughly Eliminate Pests and Diseases to Ensure a Bumper Autumn Harvest
By Our Commentator

In the first half of this year, rural people's communes in various regions waged a resolute struggle against crop pests and diseases in agricultural production, thereby ensuring a bumper harvest of summer crops. Now, a mass pest and disease prevention and control campaign centered on "guaranteeing the autumn harvest" is being carried out on an even larger scale, which will play a significant role in ensuring the healthy growth of seedlings and seizing a bumper autumn harvest.

Currently, the weather is hot, which is the season for the large-scale occurrence of various pests and diseases. Judging from the pest situation in various regions, there are many types of pests and diseases this year, they are widely distributed, and they are coming on strongly. According to surveys, stem borers that harm rice, red spiders and springtails that harm cotton in the Yangtze River basin; rice blast, armyworms, corn borers, potato late blight, and cotton bollworms in northern regions have all shown increasingly serious development trends recently. If effective measures are not taken as soon as possible, they will cause serious damage to crops. Past experience tells us that to truly secure grain and cotton, while strengthening field management, we must also firmly and practically grasp the word "guarantee."

To achieve a complete victory in pest and disease prevention and control, we must first continuously improve prevention and control technology based on the laws of pest and disease occurrence and development. Early prevention and striving for the initiative are fundamental links in overcoming pests and diseases. Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, has reduced the early rice stem borer damage rate to below 0.2% this year by starting early and adopting a combination of comprehensive prevention and concentrated control, and the damage caused by planthoppers and leafhoppers has also been greatly reduced compared to previous years. The facts in Huangyan County prove that pests can be completely eradicated. The method is to act early, grasp the key period according to the laws of pest occurrence, and quickly eliminate them; not only should the first or second generation of pests be treated early, but also "treat each generation early." When pests first appear, take comprehensive prevention and control measures that combine mass prevention with professional team prevention, manual prevention with chemical prevention, and pest control with current agricultural activities, and conduct a comprehensive encirclement and suppression to completely eradicate the pests.

Preparing in advance, effectively solving the problem of pest control machinery and pesticides, and making labor arrangements are the fundamental guarantees for winning pest and disease prevention and control. It is a fact that there are many agricultural tasks and labor is relatively tight at present; however, we must not relax our efforts in pest control in the slightest. The better the preparatory work is done in advance, the more proactive we can be, and the more labor we can save. Therefore, labor must be considered comprehensively and arranged reasonably. Usually, a pest control team composed of a small number of people is responsible for regular pest and disease prevention and control; once a pest occurs, a mass campaign of concentrated pest elimination is launched. Although the amount of chemical pesticides supplied by the state this year has increased compared to last year, it still cannot fully meet the needs. All regions must continue to implement the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and manufacture large quantities of indigenous pesticides. Currently, it is the peak season for the growth of various botanical pesticides. People's communes and production teams in various regions should collect large quantities, use local materials, and manufacture pesticides locally to solve the pesticide needs of their own communes and teams.

Doing a good job in pest and disease prevention and control, like doing any other work well, hinges on strengthening the leadership of the Party. Party committees at all levels must take charge of pest control work, effectively grasp the pest situation, prepare pesticides, machinery, and personnel, and take immediate action once pests occur to quickly and completely eliminate them.

    彻底消灭病虫害  确保秋季丰收
    本报评论员
    今年上半年，各地农村人民公社在农业生产中，同农作物病虫害进行了坚决的斗争，从而保证夏收作物获得了丰收。现在，以“保秋”为中心的群众性的防治病虫害运动，又在更广大的规模上开展起来，这对于保证禾苗健壮生长夺取秋季丰收，将会起到很大的作用。
    目前，天气炎热，正是各种病虫大量发生的季节。从各地虫情来看，今年病虫发生种类多、分布广，而且来势较猛。据调查，长江流域为害水稻的螟虫、为害棉花的红蜘蛛和跳虫；北方地区的稻瘟病、粘虫、玉米螟、马铃薯晚疫病和棉铃虫等病虫，近来都有日益严重的发展趋势，如不及早采取有效措施，将会对农作物造成严重的危害。过去的经验告诉我们，要把粮食、棉花真正拿到手，在加强田间管理的同时，还必须要把“保”字抓紧、抓实。
    要取得防治病虫的彻底胜利，首先必须根据病虫发生与发展的规律，不断提高防治技术，而及早防治、争取主动，又是战胜病虫害的基本环节。浙江省黄岩县今年由于动手早，采取全面预防和突击防治相结合的办法，已将早稻螟害率降低到0.2％以下，飞虱和浮尘子的为害也比往年大大减轻。黄岩县的事实证明，虫害是可以彻底扑灭的，办法就是早，就是根据虫害发生的规律抓住关键时期，迅速扑灭；不仅第一代或第二代虫害要治得早，而且要做到“代代治早”。在虫害一露头的时候，就采取发动群众防治与专业队防治相结合、人工防治与药剂防治相结合、治虫与当时的农事活动相结合等等的综合防治措施，进行全面围歼，就能够把虫害彻底扑灭。
    事先作好准备，切实解决治虫药械和作好劳动安排，是夺取防治病虫害的根本保证。当前农活多，劳动力比较紧张是事实；但是对治虫丝毫也不能放松，越是事先准备工作作得好，越是能争取主动，就越能节省劳动力。因此，对劳动力必须统筹兼顾，合理安排。平时，由少数人组成的治虫专业队负责经常的病虫防治工作；虫害一旦发生，则开展群众性的突击治虫灭虫运动。今年国家供应的化学农药虽比去年有所增加，但仍不能充分满足需要。各地须继续贯彻“土洋并举”的方针，大量制造土农药。目前正是各种植物性农药大量生长季节，各地人民公社和生产队，应进行大量采集，就地取材，就地制造，解决本社本队所需要的农药问题。
    做好防治病虫害的工作，像做好其他任何工作一样，关键在于加强党的领导。各级党委要把治虫工作抓起来，切实掌握虫情，准备好药械和人手，一旦虫害发生，立即行动，迅速把病虫彻底消灭。
