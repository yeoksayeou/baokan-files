Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Bulawayo Dispatch: In Bulawayo, the industrial and commercial center of Southern Rhodesia, Africans continued to demonstrate on the 25th and 26th. African workers also launched strikes to protest the atrocities and brutal colonial rule of the British colonial authorities.

On the 25th, British colonial authorities dispatched a large number of police, supported by aircraft, in two attempts to force their way into African residential areas. Africans launched a heroic counterattack. After fierce fighting, the colonial police retreated in disarray. Africans also rushed out of the African residential area to attack colonialists' cars and trains. Reports say that striking Africans also fought the colonial military police who were suppressing them with stones in various parts of the city.

The flustered British colonial authorities hurriedly dispatched more armed military police, supported by armored vehicles, to surround African towns and arrested more than 100 demonstrating Africans. At the same time, they hurriedly recalled the Royal Rhodesian First Battalion from Salisbury, which had been sent there not long ago to suppress African demonstrations. The suppression by the colonial military police aroused even greater anger among the Africans. That evening, Africans burned colonial government offices and colonialists' cars in African towns, setting off a raging fire.

In order to carry out large-scale armed suppression, the colonial authorities ordered four reserve battalions to report the next day on the evening of the 25th.

Early in the morning of the 26th, the police opened fire on demonstrating Africans, killing at least one person. Thus, since the demonstrations against British colonial rule broke out in Bulawayo on the 24th, at least six Africans have been killed by the colonial military police.

It is also reported that Nkomo, the person in charge of foreign affairs of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, protested the repressive atrocities of the Southern Rhodesian colonial authorities at a press conference held in London on the 24th, and demanded the immediate establishment of an independent body to manage the country, and the establishment of a commission of inquiry to study all laws passed by the Southern Rhodesian colonial parliament since 1923, and to study the possibility of the people of Southern Rhodesia electing their own government.

Nkomo said that 180 members of the National Democratic Party have been arrested since the 19th. His party has written to the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to protest the arrests.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Bulawayo Dispatch: In Bulawayo, the industrial and commercial center of Southern Rhodesia, the struggle of Africans against British colonial rule continues to develop. Following the large demonstration of 7,000 Africans on the 24th, African workers in the industrial area held a strike on the morning of the 25th, and African employees of many stores also joined the strike. The strike brought local industrial and commercial activities to a virtual standstill.

Reports say that Africans in Bulawayo fought bravely with the large number of colonial military police who came to suppress them, and attacked colonialists' cars with stones.

Reports also say that on the morning of that day, courageous Africans, despite the crazy suppression of the colonial military police, surrounded the office of the dry cleaning company opened by Miller, the British colonial mayor of Bulawayo, shouting slogans to protest the brutal rule of the British colonial authorities. It is reported that the colonial mayor later escaped the encirclement of angry Africans only with the help and escort of a large number of colonial troops.

Faced with the rising anti-colonial struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia, the British colonial authorities sent troops and police to step up the suppression. Colonial police used tear gas, batons, and shields to constantly attack Africans, attempting to disperse Africans gathered in various places, and arrested a group of Africans.

At the same time, the colonial military police set up a cordon between the industrial area and the African area, and police and army armored vehicles were stationed at the entrances to the African area; on the streets, British troops with bayonets fixed were deployed on the streets. According to the Associated Press, the situation in the African area there is very tense.

The surging tide of struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia has left the colonial military police stretched thin and exhausted. Whitehead, the British colonial prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, rushed from Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, to Bulawayo on the 25th, and immediately held a meeting with senior police officers of the local police bureau to deploy new suppressions. He threatened that reinforcements would enable them to take "more active steps" to deal with the situation. It is reported that all the colonial army reserves in Southern Rhodesia have been mobilized, and a battalion of colonial troops that was transferred from Bulawayo to Salisbury last week to suppress African demonstrations has rushed back to Bulawayo to "deal with the situation."

    南罗得西亚人民反殖民主义斗争继续发展
    布拉瓦约非洲人痛击殖民军警
    英国当局出动飞机装甲车镇压　六名非洲人已被害
    新华社26日讯　布拉瓦约消息：在南罗得西亚工商业中心城市布拉瓦约，非洲人25日和26日继续举行了示威，非洲工人也纷纷展开罢工斗争，抗议英国殖民当局的暴行和残酷的殖民统治。
    英国殖民当局派大批警察在飞机的支持下25日两次企图冲入非洲人住区，非洲人展开了英勇的反击。在经过激战以后，殖民警察狼狈撤退。非洲人并冲出非洲人居住区袭击殖民者的汽车和火车。消息说，罢工的非洲人也在城市各处用石头同镇压他们的殖民军警展开搏斗。
    手忙脚乱的英国殖民当局赶忙出动更多的武装军警，在装甲车的支持下包围了非洲人市镇，并且逮捕了一百多名示威的非洲人。在这同时，还赶忙从索耳兹伯里调回不久前运往那里镇压非洲人示威斗争的皇家罗得西亚第一营来应付局势。殖民军警的镇压激起了非洲人更大的愤怒。当晚，非洲人在非洲人市镇焚烧殖民当局的办公处和殖民者的汽车，燃起一片熊熊烈火。
    殖民当局为了进行大规模的武装镇压，25日晚已命令四个后备营在第二天报到。
    26日清晨，警察开枪射击示威的非洲人，至少打死一人。这样，从布拉瓦约24日发生反对英国殖民统治的示威以来，至少已有六名非洲人被殖民军警杀害。
    另悉，南罗得西亚民族民主党外交事务负责人恩科莫24日在伦敦举行的记者招待会上，抗议南罗得西亚殖民当局的镇压暴行，并且要求立即成立一个独立机构来管理国家，同时成立一个调查委员会来研究1923年以来由南罗得西亚殖民者议会所通过的所有法律，并且研究南罗得西亚人民选举他们自己的政府的可能性。
    恩科莫说，自从19日以来，民族民主党已有一百八十个党员被捕。他的党已经写信给英国联邦关系大臣抗议逮捕。
    新华社26日讯　布拉瓦约消息：在南罗得西亚工商业中心城市布拉瓦约，非洲人反对英国殖民统治的斗争继续发展。继24日七千非洲人的大示威以后，25日清晨，那里工业区的非洲工人举行了罢工，许多商店的非洲职工也纷纷投入罢工斗争。罢工使当地整个工商业的活动几乎完全停顿。
    消息说，布拉瓦约的非洲人同前来镇压他们的大批殖民军警展开英勇的搏斗，并且用石头袭击殖民者的汽车。
    消息还说，当天上午，英勇的非洲人不顾殖民军警的疯狂镇压，曾包围了布拉瓦约英国殖民市长米勒开设的干洗公司的办公处，高呼口号抗议英国殖民当局的残酷统治。据报道，这位殖民市长后来只是在大批殖民军队的帮助和护送下，才逃脱愤怒的非洲人的包围。
    面对着南罗得西亚人民日益高涨的反殖民主义斗争，英国殖民当局派军警加紧进行镇压。殖民警察用催泪弹、警棍和盾牌不断对非洲人进行冲击，企图驱散各处聚集在一起的非洲人，并且逮捕了一批非洲人。
    在这同时，在工业区到非洲人区之间，殖民军警布置了警戒，警察和军队的装甲车驻守着进入非洲人区的路口；在街道上，英国军队拿着上了刺刀的步枪在街头布岗放哨。据美联社报道，那里非洲人区的局势十分紧张。
    汹涌而起的南罗得西亚人民的斗争浪潮，使殖民军警捉襟见肘，疲于奔命。南罗得西亚英国殖民总理怀特赫德25日从南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里赶往布拉瓦约，并且立即同当地警察总局的高级警官举行了会议，布置新的镇压。他扬言增援部队将使得能够采取“更积极的步骤”来对付局势。据报道，在南罗得西亚所有殖民军队的后备队已经动员起来，上周为了镇压索耳兹伯里非洲人的示威从布拉瓦约调去的一营殖民军已经赶回布拉瓦约去“应付局势”。
