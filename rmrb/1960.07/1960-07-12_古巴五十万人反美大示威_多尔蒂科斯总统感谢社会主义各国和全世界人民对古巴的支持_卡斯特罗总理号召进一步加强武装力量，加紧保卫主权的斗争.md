Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 10th: Half a million angry Cuban people, waving machetes, fists, and flags, held a massive anti-American demonstration and rally in front of the Presidential Palace in Havana today, expressing their strong protest against the aggression and threats of the U.S. imperialists and their firm support for the government's determination to defend the motherland.

Participating in the demonstration were workers, peasants, militiamen, students, and people from all walks of life from the provinces of Havana, Matanzas, and Pinar del Rio. They held aloft signs reading "Rather go without (sugar) quotas than be slaves" and "Swear to defend the motherland."

One of the characteristics of today's demonstration was the Cuban people's fearless attitude in the face of a strong enemy and their confidence in final victory. Many workers, peasants, and militiamen said that they would smash the American threats by increasing production, practicing thrift, and intensifying military training, and expressed their determination to resolutely implement land reform and realize the democratic revolution.

President Dorticos spoke at the mass rally, emphasizing the great significance of the support of the people of Latin American countries, the people of the socialist camp, and the people of all countries around the world for Cuba. Referring to Khrushchev's statement that the Soviet Union would launch rockets at countries that might launch aggression against Cuba, he said, "We unreservedly express our respect for the Soviet government's support."

Dorticos condemned the U.S. sugar law as a blatant aggression against the Cuban economy. He said that the more frequent the aggression against Cuba, the greater and more profound the victories won by the revolutionary people. Dorticos said, "The people are responding to all this with the slogan 'Rather go without quotas than be slaves.'" He emphasized that nothing could make Cuba retreat.

Dorticos concluded by saying that the revolutionary government would return to the United States a $2,000 check it received a few days ago, which was intended to pay the annual rent for the Guantanamo base. He pointed out that the Cuban government was doing this to warn the United States that Cuban territory cannot be bought with dollars, and that Cuban territory is neither sold nor rented to foreigners.

Major Guevara, Governor of the National Bank of Cuba, condemned the United States at the mass rally for tearing off its mask due to its aggression against Cuba. He pointed out that the United States' power in the world has been greatly weakened and is now threatening Cuba with force and beastly madness.

Jesus Soto, Organizing Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, called on workers to increase production, practice economy, and be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries who sabotage production. He also called on all workers to join the militia to defend the motherland.

Cuban Premier Castro, who was unable to attend the mass rally due to illness, delivered a televised speech to the Cuban people from his sickbed tonight, thanking the powerful Soviet Union for its support of Cuba on behalf of the Cuban government. Castro said, "Now we know that we will not be fighting alone." He emphasized, "The Soviet Union has spoken. I believe this is the opinion of all countries in the socialist camp that possess tremendous power in the world."

He said that throughout the world, from Japan to Korea, Turkey, Panama, Asia, Africa, and all of Latin America, people are opposing U.S. imperialism, as a result of their exploitation of the people of the world and the extraction of billions of dollars from the people of various countries.

Castro said that the United States has no right to use international organizations to destroy any nation. He emphasized, "We say to it that from now on we will resist any unilateral or collective measures aimed at military aggression against Cuba. The United States has no right to impose its laws on Cuba or any Latin American country." Cuba will not accept obligations that would insert a dagger into the heart of Cuba. He concluded by saying that logic is useless in predicting American policies because they are guided by absurdity. He warned that, therefore, the people should further strengthen their armed forces and intensify their preparations to defend their sovereignty.

Today, grand demonstrations were also held simultaneously in eight cities in Camaguey, Las Villas, and Oriente provinces, strongly protesting against the U.S. government's outrageous crimes of cutting Cuba's sugar quotas and embargoing oil. Demonstrators continuously shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism" and "Yankees get out of Latin America" to answer the United States' intention to launch armed aggression against Cuba under the smokescreen of anti-communism.

　　古巴五十万人反美大示威
　　多尔蒂科斯总统感谢社会主义各国和全世界人民对古巴的支持
　　卡斯特罗总理号召进一步加强武装力量，加紧保卫主权的斗争
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　挥舞着弯刀、拳头和旗帜的五十万愤怒的古巴人民今天在哈瓦那总统府前面举行了声势浩大的反美示威和群众集会，表示他们对美帝国主义者的侵略威胁的强烈抗议和对政府保卫祖国的决心的坚决支持。
    参加示威的群众有来自哈瓦那、马坦萨斯和比那尔德里奥等省的工人、农民、民兵、学生和各界人民。他们高举着“宁可不要（食糖）份额，也不当奴仆”和“誓死保卫祖国”的标语牌。
    今天示威的特点之一是古巴人民在强敌面前的无畏态度和对于最后胜利的信心。许多工人、农民和民兵说，他们将以增加生产、厉行节约和加紧军事训练来粉碎美国的威胁，并且表示了坚决贯彻土地改革和实现民主革命的决心。
    多尔蒂科斯总统在群众集会上讲了话，他强调指出了拉丁美洲各国人民、社会主义阵营各国人民以及全世界各国人民支持古巴的巨大意义。他在谈到赫鲁晓夫关于苏联将向可能对古巴发动侵略的国家发射火箭一事时说，“我们毫无保留地对苏联政府的支持表示敬意”。
    多尔蒂科斯斥责美国的食糖法是对古巴经济的明显的侵略。他说，对古巴发动的侵略越频繁，革命的人民取得的胜利就更巨大，更深刻。多尔蒂科斯说，“人民用‘宁可不要份额也不当奴仆’的口号来回答这一切”。他强调说，任何东西也不能使古巴后退。
    多尔蒂科斯最后说，革命政府将把在几天以前收到的一张二千美元的支票退还美国，这笔款子是他们用来交纳关塔那摩基地的每年的租金。他指出，古巴政府这样做是为了警告美国：古巴的领土是不能用美元来收买的，古巴的领土不出卖也不出租给外国人。
    古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉少校在群众集会上谴责美国由于侵略古巴而揭去了它的假面具。他指出，美国在全世界的力量已经大大削弱，现在正在用武力、野兽般的疯狂来威胁古巴。
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托号召工人增加生产，实行节约，并且警惕破坏生产的反革命分子。他还号召全体工人参加民兵，保卫祖国”。
    因病未能参加群众集会的古巴总理卡斯特罗今天晚上在病床上对古巴人民发表了电视演说，他代表古巴政府感谢强大的苏联对古巴的支持。卡斯特罗说，“现在我们知道，我们将不是单独地进行战斗”。他强调说，“苏联已经发言了。我相信，这是在世界上拥有巨大力量的社会主义阵营所有国家的意见。”
    他说，在全世界，从日本到朝鲜、土耳其、巴拿马、亚洲、非洲和整个拉丁美洲都在反对美帝国主义，这是他们剥削全世界人民、榨取各国人民亿万美元的结果。
    卡斯特罗说，美国没有权利为了摧毁任何一国人民而利用国际组织。他强调说，“我们对它说，从现在起我们将抗击任何目的在于对古巴进行军事侵略的一切单方面的或集体的措施。美国没有权利把它的法律强加给古巴或任何拉丁美洲国家。”古巴不会接受那些会在古巴的心脏上插入一把尖刀的义务。他最后说，在预测美国的政策时，逻辑学是无用的，因为他们是以荒谬作为指导方针的。他告诫说，因此，人民应该进一步加强武装力量，加紧进行保卫主权的准备工作。
    今天，在卡马圭、拉斯维利亚斯和奥连特省的八个城市也同时举行了盛大的示威，强烈抗议美国削减古巴的食糖份额和禁运石油的横暴罪行。示威群众不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义”和“美国佬从拉丁美洲滚出去”的口号，来回答美国打算在反共的烟幕下发动对古巴的武装侵略。
