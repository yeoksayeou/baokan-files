	Reforming Knitwear Design
Since June of this year, workers in the Guangzhou West District knitting industry have widely launched product revolution activities. In one month, the designs of more than 120 varieties have been reformed, and 23 of them have already been put into production. Workers at the Guangzhou Knitting Factory reformed the design of women's undershirt vests, appropriately shortening the length and replacing the folded hem with a ribbed hem. The quality remains the same, but cotton yarn can be saved by 23 percent. The cotton yarn that used to produce ten dozens of women's undershirt vests can now produce thirteen dozens. Li Yuxing Knitting Factory improved three types of women's shirts: printed lapel, printed straight collar, and one-word collar. In the past, sleeves were made with separate fabric, but now the sleeves are made from the original fabric, which is both beautiful and saves labor and materials, saving cotton yarn by 23 percent. In June, this factory produced 860 dozens of these three types of women's shirts, saving 9,200 taels of cotton yarn. This factory also reformed the cutting method for men's round-neck undershirts and long-sleeved undershirts. These five varieties alone saved enough cotton yarn in June to produce 350 dozens of cultural shirts. (Ye Zuyao, Song Jin, Ye Zhenhan)

    改革针织品设计
    今年六月份以来，广州西区针织行业职工普遍开展了产品革命的活动。一个月来，已改革了一百二十多个品种的设计，其中有二十三个品种已经投入生产。广州针织厂职工改革了女装汗衫背心的设计，适当地缩短了长度，并且以罗纹脚代替了折脚，质量不变，可以节约棉纱百分之二十三。过去生产十打女汗衫背心的棉纱，现在就可以生产十三打。李裕兴针织厂改进了印花反领、印花直领及一字领三种女衬衣，过去是另外用布来做袖子，现在改为原布出袖，既美观大方，又省工省料，节约棉纱百分之二十三。六月份，这个厂生产了这三个品种的女衬衣八百六十打，节约棉纱九千二百两。这个厂还改革了男装圆领汗衫和长袖汗衫的裁剪方法。这五个品种，仅六月份节约下来的棉纱，就可以生产文化衫三百五十打。（叶祖耀、宋金、叶振汉）
