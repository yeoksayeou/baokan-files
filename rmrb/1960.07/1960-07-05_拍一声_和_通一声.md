    "Snap!" and "Thud!"
    Mao Maochang, Foundry Worker, Shanghai Boiler Factory

    The story "Everyone is Zhou Lichun," included in the "Selected Shanghai Folk Tales," is a very good piece of work.

    "Everyone is Zhou Lichun" illustrates Zhou Lichun's prestige and reflects the feelings of the reactionaries before their death. The government soldiers feared Zhou Lichun and those who sympathized with and supported him. When the Qing soldiers saw an old farmer shedding tears because "Crippled Zhou" was killed, they "snapped!" and drew their gleaming steel knives to frighten the old farmer. This was the fear of a thief, bullying others by flaunting one's power, a complete paper tiger posture, truly laughable.

    The old farmer, however, was different. "Haha!" He laughed and moved closer, not retreating because of the steel knife, but standing like a giant, towering before the Qing soldier, making the soldier appear even smaller.

    When the government soldiers heard that the old farmer had lost a priceless night-luminescent pearl, they "squatted down immediately, their eyes fixed on the ground, their hands groping wildly." This greedy appearance of loving money like their lives was truly sickening.

    The old farmer seized this opportunity, "picked up a blue stone nearby, and smashed it hard on the Qing soldier's head, 'thud!' With a twitch of his legs, the Qing soldier breathed his last." A good hit, a delightful hit, truly exhilarating.

    "Snap!" This is the voice of the reactionaries, the usual trick of all reactionaries to scare the working people, not at all frightening, but merely a death throe.

    "Thud!" This is the voice of the struggle of the broad masses of people, a sound like a thunderclap in clear skies, shaking the whole world, awakening all the oppressed and enslaved people to rise up and struggle in a victorious prelude.
                      (Originally published in the "Wenhui Daily" on June 13th)
    [Editor's Note] Zhou Lichun was one of the leaders of the "Small Swords Society" peasant uprising in the Shanghai area during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. He was loved by the peasants but was later killed by the Qing rulers.

### “拍一声”和“通一声”

    “拍一声”和“通一声”
    上海锅炉厂铸工　毛茂昌
    收在“上海民间故事选”里的“个个都是周立春”是一篇很好的作品。
    “个个都是周立春”，这说明了周立春的威望，也反映了反动派临死前的心情。官兵怕周立春，也怕同情和支持周立春的人。清兵看见老农为了“周拐子”被杀而流泪，就“拍一声”拔出了雪亮的钢刀，来吓唬老农。这是贼胆心虚，狐假虎威，一副十足的纸老虎腔，实在令人可笑。
    老农却不然，“哈哈！”一边笑一边挨近过去，没有因为钢刀而退缩，而像一个巨人，巍然站在清兵面前，使得清兵越加渺小了。
    官兵听说老农失落价值连城的夜明珠，“早已蹲下身子，两眼瞅在地上，双手乱摸”，这副爱钱如命的贪相，实在令人作呕。
    老农趁这个机会，“拿起身边的一块青石，用力向清兵头上砸去，‘通’一声，清兵脚一挺，就此断了气。”打得好，打得多痛快，实在令人兴奋。
    “拍一声”，这是反动派的声音，是一切反动派吓唬劳动人民的惯技，并不可怕，只是临死前的挣扎。
    “通一声”，这是广大人民斗争的声音，这声音犹如晴天霹雳，震动全世界，唤醒了一切被压迫、被奴役的人们起来斗争的胜利的前奏曲。
                      （原载六月十三日“文汇报”）
    〔编者附注〕周立春是清朝咸丰年间上海一带的“小刀会”农民起义军的领袖之一，受到农民的爱戴，后来被清朝统治者杀害。
