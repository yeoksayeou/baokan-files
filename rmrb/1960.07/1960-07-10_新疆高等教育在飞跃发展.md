Xinjiang's higher education in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, along with the great victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the region, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, has seen a development speed and scale unprecedented in history, based on the increasing popularization of primary and secondary education.

At the beginning of liberation in 1949, Xinjiang had only one incomplete and low-level institution of higher learning (Xinjiang College), with 379 students and 36 teachers. From 1949 to 1957, while reorganizing the existing institutions of higher learning, Xinjiang established four new institutions of higher learning—agriculture, language, medicine, and teacher training—according to the needs of production and construction development. In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and in coordination with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the victory of the people's commune movement, the Party's education policy was correctly implemented, and the whole Party and the whole people were mobilized to run education, and five new institutions of higher learning were established: petroleum, mining and metallurgy, finance and economics, railway, and Shihezi Agricultural College. In 1959, after consolidation and improvement of the institutions of higher learning, the Language College was merged into the Teacher Training College. Since then, a system of higher education in the Autonomous Region covering industry, agriculture, medicine, teacher training, transportation, and finance and trade has been basically formed.

Like all institutions of higher learning in the country, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on education work, Xinjiang's higher education has also experienced continuous revolution. After the political movements, the political consciousness of the faculty and students has been significantly improved, the Party organizations in the schools have continued to grow, and the Party's leadership over the schools has been greatly strengthened. In particular, after the 1957 rectification, anti-Rightist, and anti-local nationalism struggles, the Party's leadership position in the schools has been further consolidated. Now, Marxism-Leninism and the Party's political work have become the soul and commander of all work in institutions of higher learning. Being both red and expert has become the goal of the vast number of faculty and students. The proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds in institutions of higher learning is constantly increasing. Worker and peasant children now account for 58% of the students in various institutions of higher learning.

Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" in 1958, Xinjiang's institutions of higher learning have vigorously established factories and farms, and the faculty and students have gone to factories and rural areas to participate in productive labor and professional practice, which has not only tempered their thinking but also enriched the teaching content and greatly improved the teaching effect. At the same time, it has created favorable conditions for carrying out scientific research and produced material wealth for national construction. For example, faculty and students of Xinjiang College have trial-produced analog electronic computers. Students of the agronomy department of the August 1st Agricultural College have successfully trial-produced dozens of kinds of local fertilizers. Now, the socialist education system combining teaching, production, and scientific research in various institutions of higher learning is gradually being improved. It has been and is playing an important role in cultivating construction talents who are both red and expert.

The original culture and education in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were very backward. However, higher education has achieved such rapid development in just ten years, which is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the enthusiastic support of various brother provinces and cities. At the same time, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee has always attached great importance to developing Xinjiang's higher education and training construction talents of ethnic minorities, and has carried out a series of work, especially focusing on solving the following key issues.

After liberation, although we attached great importance to the development of education in Xinjiang, the foundation of the original education was very weak, and the faculty of institutions of higher learning and high school graduates could not grow up in the short term. However, the leap-forward development of production and construction urgently required higher education to deliver a large number of cadres and specialized talents. According to the policy of education serving politics and production, Xinjiang adhered to the principle of developing from small to large, actively developing, continuously consolidating, and gradually improving, and determined the development steps of higher education. In the first eight years after liberation, due to the fact that the faculty conditions were not fully available and high school graduates could not keep up, in this period, on the one hand, we vigorously developed secondary specialized schools; on the other hand, we set up the framework of two or three institutions of higher learning, opened specialties, and recruited junior high school graduates. In this way, we not only trained a large number of specialized talents above the intermediate level for production and construction, but also prepared faculty and material conditions for the development of higher education through the development and improvement of secondary specialized schools and institutions of higher learning. Thus, with the continuous development of high schools, it was possible to gradually establish institutions of higher learning on the basis of secondary specialized schools. For example, the four new institutions of higher learning established in 1958, such as mining and metallurgy, petroleum, railway, and finance and economics, were all established on the basis of secondary specialized schools. At the same time, the original institutions of higher learning that only offered specialties were able to gradually establish undergraduate programs and recruit high school graduates. Xinjiang College, the August 1st Agricultural College, and the Teacher Training College are examples of how this has developed and improved.

Due to the shortage of faculty and student sources, it was certainly impossible to establish a higher education system all at once, but it could not wait until all the conditions were available before developing higher education. Therefore, in a certain period, it should also be based on the requirements of economic construction development, giving priority to the important and urgent, and focus on developing higher education, in order to gradually establish a higher education system and adapt the development of institutions of higher learning to the needs of construction. For example, from 1949 to 1957, in response to the needs of production and construction centered on agriculture and animal husbandry in the Autonomous Region, and at the same time, in order to train teachers for the rapidly developing secondary education, we focused on running higher agricultural and teacher training education. Since 1958, due to the continuous westward extension of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the imminent large-scale industrial construction in the Autonomous Region, in order to adapt to the new situation of greater and better leap forward in the national economy, five new institutions of higher learning, including industry, transportation, finance and economics, and agriculture, were established on the basis of secondary specialized schools, and on the basis of the original Xinjiang College, Xinjiang Comprehensive University, mainly focusing on engineering, was planned. Xinjiang University will begin enrollment this year. In this way, the development of institutions of higher learning not only closely cooperated with economic construction and served production, but also gradually formed a system in the process of production development.

Education is a cause for all the people, and only by mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people, adhering to the "walking on two legs" approach to running schools, can the education cause develop in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Xinjiang's original social productivity was very backward, but its natural resources were very rich. In order to make full use of natural resources and change Xinjiang's "poorer and whiter" image, with the strong support of the central government, Xinjiang has established many emerging industries. These industries generally have relatively strong technical strength and better material conditions; at the same time, they all need to absorb a large number of cadres and specialized talents. Therefore, in the development of higher education in Xinjiang, the strength of various units was fully mobilized, and not only the education administrative department ran higher education, but also various business departments vigorously ran higher education. In 1958, after the release of the "Instructions on Education Work" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, a high tide of running schools by "walking on two legs" was formed. Thus, with the development of various construction undertakings, higher education in various majors also developed accordingly. Now, among the nine institutions of higher learning in Xinjiang, in addition to the four institutions of higher learning, Xinjiang College, Medical College, August 1st Agricultural College, and Teacher Training College, which are sponsored by the education department, the other five institutions of higher learning are sponsored by relevant business departments.

To rapidly develop higher education in Xinjiang, it is also necessary to vigorously train ethnic minority teachers. This work was valued in the early days of liberation. On the one hand, we hired teachers from institutions of higher learning in brother provinces and regions to teach in Xinjiang. In their teaching, they trained teaching translators, taught minority students through translation, and trained ethnic teachers. On the other hand, according to needs and possibilities, we adopted the method of selecting minority high school graduates to study in brother provinces and regions of the motherland in batches, to train ethnic teachers. Through the above methods, ethnic minority teachers in institutions of higher learning have gradually grown from scratch. Originally, there was not even one ethnic teacher, but now, ethnic minority teachers account for 31.8% of the 1,200 teachers in the region's institutions of higher learning. However, the growth of ethnic minority teachers is far from meeting the needs of the development of institutions of higher learning. On the basis of the victory of the rectification, anti-Rightist, and anti-local nationalism struggles in 1957, due to the general improvement of the political awareness of ethnic minority teachers and students, Xinjiang's institutions of higher learning implemented the method of ethnic minority students learning Chinese for one year, and professional courses began to gradually adopt Chinese teaching. In this way, a broad road has been opened up for the large-scale training of ethnic teachers; at the same time, it has greatly facilitated ethnic minority students to widely read Chinese reference books, thereby continuously improving their political and professional level.

Resolutely implementing the Party's education policy is the guarantee for the rapid development of higher education in Xinjiang. The process of rapid development and improvement of higher education in Xinjiang is also a process of struggle between two roads and two ideologies. This struggle is also manifested in Xinjiang as the struggle between socialism and local nationalism. The purpose of socialist education is to "cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." We insist that higher education in Xinjiang should take the socialist road, and all work in institutions of higher learning should be guided by the political and ideological education of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's political work. Bourgeois local nationalist elements, however, emphasize the "specialness of Xinjiang," oppose conducting political and ideological education of Marxism-Leninism among students, saying that "political and ideological education affects students' study of their majors." In terms of school-running forms, we adhere to the principle of being conducive to strengthening national unity and conducive to communication between various ethnic groups, and advocate running institutions of higher learning with mixed ethnic groups, and students attend classes in separate classes. However, local nationalist elements advocate distinguishing education by ethnicity and running single-ethnic schools. In short, they spread various bourgeois local nationalist ideological influences, attempting to seize the Party's leadership over institutions of higher learning. This conspiracy of bourgeois local nationalist elements will never succeed. The struggle between two roads on the education front is a long-term one. In the future, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's educational thought, adhere to the Party's education policy, on the one hand, continue to criticize bourgeois educational thought, oppose the local nationalist reactionary school-running line that splits national unity; on the other hand, continue to criticize Rightist ideology, continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and develop higher education in Xinjiang in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, so that higher education can better serve politics and production and construction.

Like the whole country, socialist construction in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has entered a new period of high-speed development and sustained leap forward, and the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation has been vigorously launched. With the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, a larger-scale construction upsurge is about to come. The objective situation requires accelerating the training of construction talents of various ethnic groups. In order to meet the needs of socialist construction, we plan to basically establish agricultural, medical, teacher training and other higher vocational schools in all prefectures (autonomous prefectures) within a few years, and at the same time establish textile, coal, geology, art, sports and other professional institutions of higher learning. At that time, the higher education network will be established on the vast land of Xinjiang. We firmly believe that the cause of higher education in Xinjiang, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, will surely develop and improve day by day. In the near future, a strong contingent of "both red and expert" intellectuals of the working class will be formed; people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will have a high level of scientific and cultural knowledge, and Xinjiang's "poorer and whiter" image will be fundamentally changed.

    新疆高等教育在飞跃发展
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会文教部副部长　关欧洛
    新疆维吾尔自治区的高等教育，随着全区社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，在党中央、毛主席和自治区党委的领导下，在中小学教育日益普及的基础上，出现了历史上从未有过的发展速度和规模。
    1949年解放之初，新疆只有一所残缺不全、程度很低的高等学校（新疆学院），学生三百七十九人，教师三十六名。在1949年至1957年期间，新疆在整顿旧有高等学校的同时，根据生产建设发展的需要，新建了农业、语文、医学、师范等四所高等院校。1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，配合工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利，正确地贯彻执行了党的教育方针，实行全党全民大办教育事业，又新建起了石油、矿冶、财经、铁路、石河子农学院等五所高等学校。1959年，高等学校经过巩固提高，语文学院并入师范学院。从此，基本形成了自治区工、农、医、师、交通、财贸的高等教育体系。
    像全国的所有高等学校一样，遵照党中央和毛主席关于教育工作的指示，新疆的高等教育也经历了不断的革命。广大师生经过历次的政治运动，政治觉悟有了显著提高，学校党的组织不断壮大，党对学校的领导大大加强。特别是经过1957年的整风、反右派和反地方民族主义的斗争，党在学校的领导地位更加巩固。现在，马克思列宁主义的思想和党的政治工作，已成为高等学校一切工作的灵魂和统帅。又红又专已成为广大师生努力的目标。高等学校中工农出身的学生的比重不断增大。各高等学校学生中工农子弟现已占到58％。
    1958年，党中央提出“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以来，新疆各高等学校大办工厂、农场，广大师生下厂、下乡，参加生产劳动和业务实践，既锻炼了思想，又丰富了教学内容，大大提高了教学效果。同时，为开展科学研究创造了有利条件，为国家建设生产了物质财富。如新疆学院师生试制了模拟式电子计算机。八一农学院农学系学生试制成功了几十种土化肥。现在，各高等学校教学、生产、科学研究相结合的社会主义教育制度正在逐步健全。它已经和正在为培养又红又专的建设人才起着重要的作用。
    新疆维吾尔自治区原有的文化教育是十分落后的。但是，只在短短的十年中，高等教育即获得如此迅速的发展，这同党中央和毛主席的英明领导，各兄弟省市的热情支援是分不开的。同时，新疆自治区党委，对发展新疆高等教育，培养少数民族建设人才的工作，一向是十分重视的，并且进行了一系列的工作，特别是抓住解决了下面一些关键问题。
    解放以后，虽然我们十分重视发展新疆的教育事业，但由于原来教育的基础非常薄弱，高等学校师资和高中毕业生不是在短期内就能成长起来的。然而，生产建设的飞跃发展，迫切要求高等教育为它输送大量的干部和专门人才。根据教育为政治和生产服务的方针，新疆坚持了由小到大、积极发展，不断巩固、逐步提高的原则，确定了高等教育的发展步骤。在解放后的最初八年，由于师资条件还不完全具备，高中毕业生也接应不上。这一时期，一方面，我们大办了中等专业学校；另方面，搭起了两、三所高等学校的架子，开设专科，招收初中毕业生。这样，就既为生产建设培养了大量中级以上的专门人才；又通过中等专业学校和高等学校的发展和提高，为发展高等教育准备了师资和物质条件。于是，随着高中的不断发展，就能够在中等专业学校的基础上逐步建立起高等学校。如1958年新建的矿冶、石油、铁路、财经等四所高等学校，都是在中等专业学校的基础上建立起来的，同时，原来只设专科的高等学校，也能够逐步地设立本科，招收高中毕业生。新疆学院、八一农学院、师范学院等三所高等学校就是这样发展和提高的。
    由于师资和学生来源的不足，想一下子把高等教育体系建立起来固然办不到，但又不能等到什么条件都具备了以后再来发展高等教育。因此，在一定的时期内，还应当根据经济建设发展的要求，分别轻重缓急，有重点地发展高等教育，以逐步建立起高等教育体系，并使高等学校的发展同建设事业发展的需要相适应。如在1949年至1957年期间，针对自治区以农牧业为中心的生产建设发展的需要；同时，为了给迅速发展中等教育培养师资，我们着重举办了高等农业和师范教育。1958年以来，由于兰新铁路不断西伸，自治区大规模的工业建设即将到来，为了适应国民经济更大更好地跃进的新形势，在中等专业学校的基础上，又新办了包括工业、交通、财经、农业等专业的五所高等学校，并在原新疆学院的基础上，筹建以工科为主的新疆综合大学。新疆大学将在今年开始招生。这样，高等学校的发展不但紧密地配合了经济建设，为生产服务，而且在生产发展的过程中，高等教育本身也逐渐形成体系。
    教育事业是全民的事业，只有全党全民动手，坚持“两条腿走路”的办学方针，教育事业才能多快好省地发展。新疆原来的社会生产力是很落后的，但是它的天然资源却非常丰富。为了充分利用天然资源，改变新疆“更穷更白”的面貌，在中央的大力支援下，新疆兴办了不少新兴的事业。这些事业，一般技术力量比较雄厚，物质条件也较好；同时又都需要吸收大量的干部和专门人才。因此，新疆在发展高等教育中，便充分动员了各事业单位的力量，不仅教育行政部门办高等教育，而且各业务部门也大办高等教育。1958年，中共中央、国务院“关于教育工作的指示”发布后，形成了“两条腿走路”的办学高潮。于是，随着各项建设事业的发展，各专业的高等教育也相应地发展了起来。现在，新疆的九所高等学校中，除新疆学院、医学院、八一农学院、师范学院等四所高等学校由教育部门主办外，其他五所高等学校都是由有关业务部门主办的。
    要迅速发展新疆的高等教育，还必须大力培养民族师资。这件工作在解放初期就被重视起来。一方面，我们聘请兄弟省区高等学校教师到新疆讲学。他们在教学中，培养教学翻译，通过翻译给少数民族学生授课，并培养民族教师。另方面，根据需要和可能，采取分期分批选送少数民族高中毕业生到祖国兄弟省区学习的方法，培养民族师资。通过上述办法，高等学校少数民族教师，便逐渐从无到有成长了起来。原来连一个民族师资也没有，现在，全区一千二百余名高等学校教师中，少数民族教师即占31.8％。但是，民族师资成长，还远不能适应高等学校发展的需要。在1957年整风、反右派和反地方民族主义斗争胜利的基础上，由于少数民族师生的政治觉悟普遍提高，新疆各高等学校实行少数民族学生学习一年汉语的办法，专业课程开始逐步采用汉语教学。这样，便为大量培养民族师资开辟了广阔的道路；同时，也大大便利了少数民族学生广泛阅读汉文参考书籍，从而不断地提高他们的政治和业务水平。
    坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，是新疆高等教育迅速发展的保证。新疆高等教育迅速发展和提高的过程，也是两条道路和两种思想斗争的过程。这种斗争，在新疆还表现为社会主义和地方民族主义的斗争。社会主义教育的目的在于“培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。我们坚持新疆的高等教育要走社会主义的道路，高等学校的一切工作，都应该以马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育和党的政治工作为灵魂和统帅。资产阶级地方民族主义分子，却强调“新疆特殊”，反对在学生中进行马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育，说什么“政治思想教育影响学生学习专业”。在办学形式方面，我们坚持有利于加强民族团结，有利于沟通各民族之间的文化为原则，主张办各民族混合的高等学校，学生分班上课。而地方民族主义分子则主张按民族区分教育，办单一的民族学校。总之，他们散布各种资产阶级地方民族主义的思想影响，妄图夺取党对高等学校的领导权。资产阶级地方民族主义分子的这种阴谋是永远不会得逞的。教育战线上两条道路的斗争是长期的。今后，我们要更高地举起毛泽东教育思想的红旗，坚持党的教育方针，一方面，要继续批判资产阶级教育思想，反对地方民族主义反动的分裂民族团结的办学路线；另方面，要继续批判右倾思想，继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，多快好省地发展新疆的高等教育，使高等教育更好地为政治和生产建设服务。
    新疆维吾尔自治区和全国一样，社会主义建设已经进入了高速度发展和持续跃进的新时期，以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的全民运动已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来。随着兰新铁路的修通，更大规模的建设高潮即将到来。客观形势要求加速培养各民族的建设人才。为了适应社会主义建设的需要，我们计划在若干年内，在所有的专区（自治州）基本上建立起农、医、师等高等专科学校，同时还要成立纺织、煤炭、地质、艺术、体育等各种专业的高等学校。那时，高等教育网将在新疆广阔的土地上建立起来。我们坚信，新疆的高等教育事业，在党中央和毛主席以及自治区党委的正确领导下，必将日益获得发展和提高。在不久的将来，将形成一支强大的“又红又专”的工人阶级知识分子的队伍；新疆各族人民将具有高度的科学文化水平，新疆“更穷更白”的面貌将得到根本改造。（附图片）
