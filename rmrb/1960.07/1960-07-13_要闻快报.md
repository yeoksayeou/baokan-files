　　Hu Guan's Three Thousand Plus Cadres Vigorously Run Various Experimental Plots
    The cadres of Hu Guan County, Shanxi Province, are vigorously running "three plots" (agricultural experimental plots, industrial experimental plots, and animal husbandry experimental plots). Three thousand eight hundred cadres in the county have left their offices and gone to the fields, workshops, breeding farms, and other front lines of production. According to current statistics, they have established more than 1,400 mu of agricultural experimental fields, 198 industrial experimental sites, and 261 animal husbandry experimental sites. In addition to averaging 85 working days each, they have also helped various management districts and production teams solve many major problems.
　  More than 8,000 Cadres from the Beijing Military Region Go Deep into the Grassroots
    Recently, the Beijing Military Region has launched a high tide of leaders at all levels and office cadres going down to companies and grassroots units. On July 5, Yang Yong, commander of the Beijing Military Region, and other responsible cadres personally led more than 120 office cadres to go down to the companies. According to incomplete statistics, from mid-May to the end of June, the number of leaders above the regimental level and office cadres who went down to the companies in the entire military region reached more than 8,800, totaling more than 60,000 working days. Leaders taking the lead, with great momentum, in an organized, planned, and purposeful manner, and helping companies solve specific problems in a down-to-earth manner by squatting and planting "experimental plots" are the main characteristics of this cadre descent to the companies. Tengchong—Another Red Banner of Phonetic Literacy
    Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, has comprehensively promoted phonetic literacy, basically achieving a county free of illiteracy. According to statistics from early June, out of 93,700 young and middle-aged illiterates in the county, 81,700 have passed the examination and become literate, accounting for 87%. They all know more than 1,500 characters and can read, write, speak, and use them. The broad masses who have shed their illiteracy caps have begun to work hard in new directions. Among them, 70,300 people have participated in spare-time senior primary school classes, and 200 people have participated in spare-time junior middle school classes.
    Popularizing Mechanical and Electrical Science Knowledge
    The First Engineering Company of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region organized mechanical and electrical literacy classes to carry out a "mechanical and electrical literacy" campaign among the broad masses of workers. From early May to early June, the company has formed 25 literacy classes, with more than 1,400 people participating in the study successively. Through learning, the workers have initially mastered some mechanical and electrical principles, and their scientific knowledge level has been improved to a certain extent. They can not only maintain, repair, and master new machines, but also continuously carry out innovation and creation, thus promoting the great promotion of new technologies and the further in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.
    Fuan Establishes Fieldside Heatstroke Prevention and Health Stations Everywhere
    In carrying out the summer patriotic health campaign, Fuan County, Fujian Province, has universally established fieldside heatstroke prevention and health stations, so that health work can better serve agricultural production. Now, every production team has fieldside heatstroke prevention and health stations, and more than 2,500 fieldside heatstroke prevention and health stations have been established throughout the county.
    After Fuan County universally established fieldside heatstroke prevention and health stations, labor has been more fully protected. According to statistics, the number of laborers who regularly attend work in the county now reaches more than 100,200, accounting for about 98% of the total number of laborers who should attend work.
