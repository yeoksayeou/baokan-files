Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th: TASS reported: In a new note to the U.S. government, the Soviet government reiterated its firm protest, expressed in its July 11th note, against the U.S. military spy plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace.

　　The Soviet government's new note was delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, Freers, on the 15th.

　　In its new note, the Soviet government firmly rejected the unfounded "protest" put forward in the U.S. government's reply of July 13th. The Soviet note stated that the U.S. government's reply proves that it is again attempting to justify and cover up the U.S. Air Force's illegal and aggressive act of violating Soviet airspace by resorting to fabrications and arbitrary denials of the facts.

　　The Soviet government's note listed irrefutable evidence regarding the time, location, and circumstances of the U.S. "RB-47" armed bomber's intrusion into Soviet territory. This aircraft was specifically equipped for espionage missions and was shot down over Soviet territorial waters. However, in the face of these irrefutable facts, the U.S. government not only fails to take measures to stop the U.S. military aircraft's provocations against the Soviet Union that endanger peace, but instead tries to evade its predicament by categorically denying the facts.

　　The Soviet note said that it is noteworthy that just a few days ago, U.S. authorities were still saying that they had no knowledge of where the aforementioned bomber had gone or where it was now. The note said that since U.S. agencies did not know where the aircraft was and had no contact with it, how could the U.S. government insist that it did not violate Soviet territory?

　　The Soviet note emphasized that the U.S. government's reply attempts to explain the reason for the downed aircraft's flight as being to complete a mission to "study electromagnetic phenomena," which is nothing new.

　　The Soviet note said that it is quite clear that the content of the U.S. government's July 13th note is based on complete fabrications, and its purpose is obviously to try to distort the facts and justify the U.S. Air Force's actions of violating Soviet airspace.

　　The Soviet note reiterated that the two surviving crew members of the "RB-47" bomber, who have been captured by Soviet ships, will be handed over to the court and severely punished according to Soviet law. As for the body of the bomber's captain, it can be handed over to U.S. representatives at any time.

　　The Soviet note pointed out that the Soviet government urges the U.S. government to pay attention to the fact that in order to avoid the innocent loss of American pilots' lives and to prevent the world from being on the brink of war in the future, only one thing needs to be done, and that is to end the policy of aggression not in words, but in actions.

　　The Soviet note concluded by saying that if this is not done, the Soviet government will consider using all means at its disposal to ensure the safety of the Soviet people.

### 苏联再次照会美国指出　美机侵苏罪责抵赖不了

　　苏联再次照会美国指出
　　美机侵苏罪责抵赖不了
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在一份给美国政府的新照会中，重申它在7月11日的照会中所表示的、对美国军用间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件的坚决抗议。
    苏联政府的新照会已由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在15日交给了美国驻莫斯科临时代办弗里尔斯。
    苏联政府在新照会中坚决拒绝了美国政府7月13日的复照中所提出的毫无道理的“抗议”。苏联照会说，美国政府的答复证明，美国政府再次企图借助捏造和对事实的任意否定来辩解和掩盖美国空军侵犯苏联领空的违法侵略行为。
    苏联政府在照会中列举了关于美国“RB—47型”武装轰炸机侵入苏联国境的时间、地点和情况的确凿材料，这架飞机是专门装备起来进行间谍任务，而在苏联领水上空被击落的。然而，美国政府在这种确凿的事实面前，不但不采取措施来停止美国军用飞机对苏联进行危害和平的挑衅，反而设法摆脱它所陷入的处境，矢口否认事实。
    苏联照会说，值得注意的是，只不过在几天以前，美国权威机构还说，它们丝毫不知道上述轰炸机到哪里去了和现在在什么地方。照会说，既然美国机构不知道这架飞机在什么地方，没有同它保持联系，那末美国政府怎么能够硬说，它没有侵犯苏联国境呢？
    苏联照会中着重指出，美国政府的复照中企图把被击落的飞机飞行的理由说成是要完成“研究电磁现象”的任务，这种解释已经不是什么新鲜事了。
    苏联照会说，十分明显的是：美国政府7月13日照会的内容是以彻头彻尾的捏造为根据的，其目的显然是要竭力歪曲事实，为美国空军侵犯苏联领空的行动辩解。
    苏联照会重申，已被苏联船只俘虏的“RB—47型”轰炸机上两名活着的人员，将送交法庭按照苏联法律严惩。至于轰炸机长的尸体，可以在任何时候交给美国代表。
    苏联照会指出，苏联政府促请美国政府注意，今后为了要避免美国飞行员无辜丧命和不使世界处于战争边缘，只需要做到一点，这就是：不是在口头上，而是在行动上结束侵略政策。
    苏联照会最后说，如果不这样做，苏联政府就要考虑用它所掌握的一切手段来保证苏联人民的安全。
