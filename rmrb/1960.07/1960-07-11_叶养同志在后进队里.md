　　Comrade Ye Yang in a Backward Team
　　By our reporter Zeng Cunhui
　　"If Changpo doesn't leap forward, then Shishui can never leap forward again!" Comrade Ye Yang had been thinking about this problem for a long time, and now he finally formally raised it at the general Party branch meeting of the brigade. Changpo is a backward production team in the Shishui Brigade of the Diancheng Commune in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province. Everyone agreed that it should catch up. However, when it came to how to do it, the debate began. Comrade Ye Yang proposed that he would stay in the Changpo team and work hard to improve it for a few months. Some members of the general branch did not agree with this approach. They said that if Changpo was improved but Shishui (an advanced production team, always managed by Comrade Ye Yang) was neglected, wouldn't that be a greater loss than gain? They believed that the main responsibility of the general branch secretary should be to focus on the advanced and create experience. Some believed that the Changpo team was "old and conservative," and that as long as a thorough rectification was carried out from top to bottom, morale could be boosted. However, Comrade Ye Yang said that going deep into the Changpo production team to study the reasons for its backwardness and finding solutions would not only help the Changpo production team but also greatly benefit the promotion of overall work. The general branch members agreed to his staying in the Changpo team after hearing his explanation. When he arrived at the Changpo production team, the deputy captain, Xiao Kejiang, and other cadres indeed complained to him that the masses were "too backward," saying that the commune members "don't even pick up a pile of cow dung when they go out," and so on. Ye Yang already knew that the cadres in this team participated in less labor, didn't go deep enough, and the masses had opinions. However, the cadres here didn't first examine their own shortcomings but instead blamed the masses. Years of experience told him that he should go to the masses. As long as he was with the poor peasant brothers and sisters and made a confidant friend, everything would be easy to handle.

　　Thus, after staying in the team headquarters for two days, he decided to move in with Yang Guifang, a poor peasant woman. Yang Guifang was a poor peasant woman with a son. Ye Yang remembered that she was a resolute activist during the land reform and had been elected as a women's representative. After the land reform, he rarely saw her, and people said her thinking had declined. Ye Yang thought that no matter what ideological problems she had, this woman who had been emancipated would not forget the Party. If he helped her well, she could become a very good women's cadre.
　　"Sister Guifang, would it be alright if I stayed here?" Ye Yang said with a smile as he put down his simple bedding at the door.
　　"Isn't it good to stay in the team headquarters?"
　　"I won't trouble you. Let me be brothers with Jiangmin (her only son) and live together. I'll help you feed the pigs and chickens and manage the private plot."
　　"Alright!" Hearing Ye Yang's sincere and warm words, Yang Guifang smiled and took Ye Yang's things into the house.

　　Ye Yang went to work with Yang Guifang every day. He saw that her family not only didn't raise pigs but didn't even have a chicken, so he borrowed five yuan to buy piglets and chicks for her. He also helped her feed the pigs and chickens before and after meals every day. Yang Guifang couldn't help but shed tears as she watched the piglets and chicks running around.

　　One day, after dinner, Ye Yang and Yang Guifang and her son sat together chatting.
　　"I've been in Changpo for more than ten days, and I haven't done any work yet." Ye Yang felt a little uneasy.
　　"What are you talking about? Every time you go out, you always carry a hoe, leading everyone to accumulate fertilizer. The rice was yellow and thin before, but now it's turning green."
　　"Accumulating fertilizer is one thing, but I'm talking about fundamentally changing the face of this team!"
　　"I didn't want to say it, but since you brought it up, I'll tell you." She picked up her water pipe and took a deep puff of smoke. "If Changpo wants to change, it may have to start with the cadres. If the cadres and Party members take the lead, everyone will change." She told Ye Yang that out of the six Party members in this team, two rarely participated in labor and "didn't know about the affairs of the fields," and one Party member in charge of women's work had never been to the fields.

　　At this time, several commune members living nearby also came over, all saying that the cadres criticized the masses for being backward every day but didn't take the lead in production themselves. It was true that many commune members spent less time working because they were engaged in their own side occupations, but this was also because the cadres didn't set a good example. At the same time, the masses also praised good cadres, such as branch secretary Shao Daguang, who the masses said was active in his work and often took the lead in participating in labor, and was a good Party member.

　　The next day, Ye Yang convened a branch meeting of this production team. He did not directly criticize the few Party members with poor work styles. He thought that cadres in backward areas generally lacked confidence and that the focus should be on discovering and praising good people and good deeds. Therefore, he first praised Shao Daguang, calling on all Party members to learn from him, lead by example, and take the lead in labor, only in this way could they connect with the masses and do a good job. Those cadres with shortcomings took the initiative to make self-criticisms, and indeed changed afterward. For example, Captain Zhan Yongxiang privately said to Deputy Captain Xiao Kejiang: "We can't hide at home for meetings anymore!" They all went out to accumulate fertilizer with Ye Yang. The cadres not only took the lead in production but also carried manure baskets to pick up manure when they went to the county town.

　　Under Ye Yang's leadership, they also paid attention to the livelihood issues of the masses. For example, commune member Shao Ruren's stomach illness was getting worse and worse. Zhan Yongxiang and Xiao Kejiang, together with Ye Yang, often visited his home, asked doctors to see him, and bought him medicine. Two months later, Shao Ruren's illness was seventy to eighty percent better.

　　Soon, Yang Guifang also reported an important issue to Ye Yang, which was that the "three guarantees" were not being implemented in this team. This team had the worst natural conditions in the entire brigade: fewer people, more land, poor soil quality, and frequent droughts. In the early days of liberation, the yield per mu was only a few dozen catties per crop, and in 1957 it was only a little over a hundred catties, but the contracted output was about the same as other teams. Therefore, they "lost output" every year, and the masses had opinions. After Ye Yang's in-depth understanding, it turned out that the cadres also felt that the contracted output targets for this team were too high, but the cadres in the brigade had not asked them to adjust them.

　　Ye Yang immediately felt that the issue of contracted output was the key to changing the backwardness of this team. After discussing it with the cadres of the Changpo team, he announced to the commune members that the "three guarantees" indeed had unreasonable aspects and should be adjusted. Before the adjustment was completed, the "lost output" regulations would be canceled. The commune members were all excitedly discussing the news, saying, "This is fair!" From then on, a truly new atmosphere appeared in Changpo Village: the stinking and dirty garbage heaps and sewage ponds of the past were gone, and the commune members all learned from the cadres and carried manure baskets to pick up manure when they went to town, and there were no more people going empty-handed. Commune member Shao Dahai said with emotion: "If the roots are right, the tree will grow straight. This is all because the cadres are setting a good example!"

　　叶养同志在后进队里
　　本报记者　曾存惠
    “长坡不跃进，湿水就不能再跃进！”这个问题叶养同志已经想了很久，现在才在大队党总支会议上正式提出来。长坡是广东省电白县电城公社湿水大队的一个落后生产队，要使它赶上来，大家都同意。但是，谈到怎样抓的时候，争论就开始了。叶养同志提出，他要住到长坡队去，狠狠地抓它几个月。总支委员中有人不赞成这样作，他们说如果抓了长坡，丢了湿水（先进生产队，一向由叶养同志抓），岂不是得不偿失？他们认为总支书记的主要责任应该是抓先进，创造经验。有的认为长坡队是“老保守”，只要从上到下狠狠地整顿一下，干劲就可以鼓起来。但是叶养同志说，深入长坡生产队去研究一下落后的原因，找出解决办法，不仅帮助了长坡生产队，而且对推动全面的工作也有很大好处。总支委员们听叶养这样解释，都同意他住到长坡队去。到了长坡生产队，副队长萧克江和别的干部果然在他面前埋怨群众“太落后”，说社员“出门一趟连牛屎都不拾一堆回来”，等等。叶养原来就约略知道这个队的干部参加劳动少、工作不深入、群众有意见。但是，这里的干部不首先检查自己的缺点，却说群众的不是。几年来的经验告诉他，应该到群众中去。只要和贫农兄弟在一起，交个知心朋友，一切事情都好办。
    这样，他在队部里住了两天，就决定搬到贫农杨桂芳家去住。杨桂芳是一个贫农妇女，有一个儿子。叶养记得她在土改时是一个斗争坚决的积极分子，曾被选为妇女代表。土改后就很少见到她，人们说她思想退坡了。叶养想，不管她有什么思想问题，这个翻了身的妇女一定不会忘记党的，好好帮助她，还会成为很好的妇女干部。
    “桂芳嫂，我来你这里住好吗？”叶养把简单的铺盖在门口一放，笑着说。
    “住在队部里不好吗？”
    “我不会麻烦你，让我和江民（她的独子）做个兄弟，住在一起吧。我来替你喂猪喂鸡，管自留地。”
    “好吧！”听到叶养说得这样诚恳、亲热，杨桂芳笑起来了，把叶养的东西拿进房去。
    叶养每天都和杨桂芳一起去劳动，他看见她家里不但没有养猪，连一只鸡也没有，就借了五块钱给她买小猪、小鸡。每天饭前饭后还帮助她喂猪喂鸡。杨桂芳看着小猪、小鸡跑来跑去，不由的滚下了热泪。
    一天，刚吃过晚饭，叶养和杨桂芳母子坐在一起聊天。
    “我来长坡十多天了，还没有做什么工作呢。”叶养心里有些不安。
    “那里的话。你来这里每次出门总扛上一把锄头，带动大家积肥，以前的禾又黄又瘦，现在禾都转青了。”
    “积肥是一件事，我说的是根本改变这个队的面貌呀！”
    “我本来不想说，现在你提起来，就同你说吧。”她拿起水烟筒深深地吸了一口烟，“长坡要改变，恐怕要先从干部改起，干部、党员带个头，大家就改了。”她告诉叶养，这个队六个党员中，有两个很少参加劳动，“不知田里事”，一个负责妇女工作的党员没有下过田。
    这时，住在附近的几个社员也走过来了，都说干部天天批评群众落后，自己又不带头生产。说不少社员搞自己的副业出勤少是事实，但这也是干部没有做个好样。同时群众也表扬了好的干部，如支部书记邵大光，群众就说他工作积极，经常带头参加劳动，是个好党员。
    第二天，叶养就召开了这个生产队的分支部会议。他对几个作风不好的党员没有直接提出批评。他想，落后地区的干部一般都缺乏信心，应该以发现和表扬好人好事为主。因此他首先表扬了邵大光，号召所有党员都向他学习，以身作则，带头劳动，只有这样才能联系群众，做好工作。那些有缺点的干部反而自动作了自我批评，事后也的确有了改变。例如队长詹永祥私下就对副队长萧克江说：“不能再躲在家里开会啦！”他们都跟着叶养出去积肥。干部们不仅带头生产，而且去县城也带着粪箕拾粪。
    在叶养带动下，他们也注意关心群众的生活问题。例如社员邵汝仁胃病越来越重，詹永祥、萧克江都和叶养一起，经常到他家去探望，替他请医生、买药。两个月以后，邵汝仁的病就好了七、八分了。
    不久，杨桂芳又向叶养反映了一个重要问题，就是这个队“三包”不落实。这个队是全大队自然条件最差的：人少田多，土质瘦，经常受旱。解放初期亩产一造不过几十斤，1957年也只有一百多斤，而包产却和别的队差不多。因此年年“赔产量”，群众有意见。经过叶养深入了解，原来干部也认为这个队的包产指标是偏高了，只是大队里的干部都没有叫他们调整。
    叶养立即感觉到包产问题是改变这个队的落后面貌的关键。他和长坡队的干部研究后，就向社员们宣布“三包”确有不够合理的地方，要加以调整，在没有调整好以前，取消“赔产量”的规定。社员们听到这个消息，都兴高彩烈地议论起来，说“这样才公道呀！”从此，长坡村就出现了真正的新气象：过去又臭又脏的垃圾堆、污水池都不见了，社员们都学着干部的样，去城也带粪箕拾粪，再看不见空手去、空手回的人了。社员邵大槐感慨地说：“根正树就直，这都是干部带头带得好！”
