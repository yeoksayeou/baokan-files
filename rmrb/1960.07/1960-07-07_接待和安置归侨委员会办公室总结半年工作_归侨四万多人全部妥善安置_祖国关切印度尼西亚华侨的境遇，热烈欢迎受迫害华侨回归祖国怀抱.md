Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The Office of the Reception and Settlement of Returned Overseas Chinese Committee of the People's Republic of China recently held a meeting to summarize the work of receiving and settling returned Overseas Chinese in the first half of the year and to determine future tasks.

    Attendees expressed serious concern about the increasingly intensified anti-Chinese activities of influential groups in Indonesia, and were extremely indignant at the atrocities committed by the West Java military authorities in shooting overseas Chinese women under the instigation and support of influential groups in Indonesia. They unanimously expressed their support for the serious protest lodged by Huang Zhen, China's ambassador to Indonesia, to the Indonesian government on this matter, demanding that the murderers be severely punished, that the families of the victims be compensated, that the arrested overseas Chinese be released, that the forced relocations be stopped, and that similar incidents be guaranteed not to occur again.

    The meeting summarized the experiences of receiving and settling returned Overseas Chinese in the past six months. The meeting considered that the work of receiving and settling returned Overseas Chinese in the first half of this year has been very successful. By the end of May, a total of 41,677 returned Overseas Chinese had been received and all had been properly settled. The number of Overseas Chinese settled in half a year is close to the total number of Overseas Chinese settled by the state in the past ten years. The government has newly built and expanded more than 20 state-owned Overseas Chinese farms to settle returned Overseas Chinese, and has established secondary supplementary schools for returned Overseas Chinese students in Nanning, Kunming, Zhanjiang and other places, and industrial or agricultural technical schools in Wuhan, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Hainan and other places. Various Overseas Chinese farms have actively carried out farm construction, and relevant departments of the central government have given priority to allocating a large number of living and production materials to supply various Overseas Chinese farms and reception ports.

    The meeting pointed out that in the work of receiving and settling a large number of returned Overseas Chinese, party committees at all levels personally led the work, and commercial, land reclamation, cultural and educational, health, customs, transportation, railway departments and relevant people's communes at all levels also gave strong support. Through this series of facts, the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have more deeply realized the superiority of the socialist system. They said that only the socialist motherland truly cares about the plight of Overseas Chinese, and only the motherland, which has achieved great success under the illumination of the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, has the strength to receive and settle such a large number of Overseas Chinese in a short period of time.

    The meeting pointed out that the vast number of newly returned Overseas Chinese have carried forward the tradition of patriotism, obeyed the allocation of the motherland, and have actively invested in labor production in state-owned Overseas Chinese farms and various production and construction posts after returning to the country. Some have already achieved success in labor production and study. Their lives have been properly arranged and guaranteed, and children of school age have been enrolled in schools. The work of reception and settlement has also greatly promoted the continued leap forward of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and returned Overseas Chinese students across the country. Currently, participating in red flag competitions, striving to plant experimental fields, and striving to become three-good students have sprung up and formed a upsurge among returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and returned Overseas Chinese students in twenty provinces (regions) and cities.

    The meeting pointed out that the anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities launched by influential groups in Indonesia have suffered a shameful failure. They attempted to use anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese sentiment to incite chauvinistic emotions, divert the domestic people's struggle to safeguard national independence and democratic rights, attack domestic democratic and progressive forces, please U.S. imperialism, and pave the way for military dictatorship. However, their conspiracy did not succeed. As a result of the Indonesian influential groups' exclusion of Overseas Chinese economy, which is beneficial to the local economy, Indonesia's economic difficulties are deepening. For the Chinese people, anti-China activities cannot harm the great People's Republic of China in the slightest. The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people has developed further, and the patriotic unity of Overseas Chinese has become more consolidated and expanded. The return of a large number of Overseas Chinese has also added fresh troops to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    The meeting considered that although the anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities of influential groups in Indonesia have suffered a shameful failure, they will not give up. At present, they are speaking empty words of friendship on the one hand, and continuing to discriminate against Overseas Chinese and even creating bloody tragedies on the other. The motherland government is extremely concerned about the tragic situation of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The meeting expressed its continued warm welcome to those Overseas Chinese who have been persecuted, displaced, and unable to make a living back to the embrace of the motherland, and pointed out that the Indonesian government should bear the responsibility for sending those Overseas Chinese who have been forcibly relocated, have no means of livelihood, and are willing to return to their motherland back to their country.

    The meeting was attended by heads of relevant departments of the Central Government, heads of reception and settlement of returned Overseas Chinese committees in various provinces (regions), heads and party secretaries of various Overseas Chinese farms, and principals of various secondary supplementary schools for returned Overseas Chinese students.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Reception and Settlement of Returned Overseas Chinese Committee of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the meeting.

    Liu Xing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, gave a report at the meeting on how to run state-owned Overseas Chinese farms well.

    接待和安置归侨委员会办公室总结半年工作
    归侨四万多人全部妥善安置
    祖国关切印度尼西亚华侨的境遇，热烈欢迎受迫害华侨回归祖国怀抱
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会办公室最近举行会议，总结了上半年接待和安置归国华侨的工作，并确定了今后的任务。
    到会的人对印度尼西亚有势力集团最近变本加厉地进行排华活动表示严重关切，对西爪哇军事当局在印度尼西亚有势力集团的策动和支持下枪杀华侨妇女的暴行表示无比愤慨。他们一致表示支持我国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇就这件事向印度尼西亚政府提出的严重抗议，要求严惩凶手，抚恤死难者家属，释放被捕华侨，停止迫迁和保证不再发生类似事件。
    会议总结了半年来接待和安置归国华侨工作的经验。会议认为，今年上半年接待安置归国华侨的工作成绩很大。到5月底止，共接待归国华侨四万一千六百七十七人，已全部予以妥善安置。半年安置的归侨就接近于过去十年由国家安置的归侨人数的总和。政府为安置归侨新建和扩建了二十多个国营华侨农场，在南宁、昆明、湛江等地新办了归国华侨学生中等补习学校，在武汉、厦门、漳州、海南等地新办了工业或农业技术学校，各个华侨农场积极进行了农场建设，中央各有关部门优先调拨了大批生活、生产资料，供应各个华侨农场和接待口岸。
    会议指出，在大量接待和安置归侨工作中，各级党委亲自领导，各级商业、农垦、文教、卫生、海关、交通、铁道部门及有关人民公社也给予大力支持。广大华侨通过这一系列的事实，愈加深刻地体会到社会主义制度的优越性。他们说，只有社会主义祖国才真正关心华侨的处境，只有在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗照耀下取得了伟大成就的祖国，才有力量在短期内接待安置这样大量的华侨。
    会议指出，广大的新回国华侨，发扬了爱国主义的传统，服从祖国的分配，回国后都在国营华侨农场和各种生产建设岗位上，积极投入了劳动生产，有的已经在劳动生产中、学习中取得成绩。他们的生活都得到了妥善的安排和确切的保证，适龄儿童都入学学习。而接待安置工作也大大推动了全国归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生继续跃进，目前参加红旗竞赛、争种试验田、争做三好学生，已经在二十个省（区）市的归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生中风起云涌，形成热潮。
    会议指出，印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的反华排华活动，遭到了可耻的失败，他们妄图利用反华排华煽起沙文主义情绪，转移国内人民要求维护民族独立和民主权利的斗争，打击国内民主进步力量，讨好美帝国主义，为走向军事独裁铺平道路。但是，他们的阴谋并没有如愿以偿。由于印度尼西亚有势力集团排斥有益于当地经济的华侨经济的结果，印度尼西亚的经济困难正在加深，而对中国人民来说，反华绝不能损伤伟大的中华人民共和国一根毫毛，中国和印度尼西亚人民的友谊更加发展，华侨的爱国大团结更加巩固和扩大。大批华侨回国，还为祖国社会主义建设增加了生力军。
    会议认为，虽然印度尼西亚有势力集团的反华排华遭到了可耻的失败，但是他们不会就此罢手。目前，他们正在一面空讲友好，一面继续排华甚至不惜制造流血惨案。对于印度尼西亚华侨的悲惨境遇，祖国政府至为关切。会议表示继续热烈欢迎那些遭受迫害、流离失所、无法谋生的华侨回到祖国的怀抱，并且指出，印度尼西亚政府对那些遭受迫迁、无以为生、愿意返回自己祖国的华侨，应当担负遣送他们回国的责任。
    到会的有中央各有关部门的负责人，各省（区）接待和安置归国华侨委员会负责人，各个华侨农场的场长、党委书记，各个归国华侨学生中等补习学校的校长等。
    中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员廖承志在会上讲了话。
    农垦部副部长刘型在会上作了关于怎样办好国营华侨农场的报告。
