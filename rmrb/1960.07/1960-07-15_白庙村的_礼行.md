The "Ritual Conduct" of Baimiao Village
　　Lǐ Jié
    After I arrived in Baimiao Village, Baqiao, Xi'an, I saw a new kind of "ritual conduct," a new virtue, which is that people give each other poems as gifts.

    Since the summer harvest, there have been more guests helping Baimiao Village with the summer harvest. Villagers welcome guests with poems, hold poetry gatherings for farewells, exchange experiences also at poetry gatherings, compete in poetry, and give poems as gifts, making it very lively. These "ritual conducts" neither affect production nor are they complicated, and they are deeply welcomed by the people.

    Professors and students from Xi'an Jiaotong University came to support Baimiao Village with wheat harvesting, and the villagers and cadres at all levels unanimously wrote poems to welcome them. Yang Xuanqi, a 58-year-old woman, said: "Teachers and students from Jiaotong University come to the village, Baimiao is full of golden phoenixes, phoenixes spread their wings into the wheat fields, Mao Zedong Thought shines golden light."

    Jin Shengkuo, a 76-year-old man who is chronically ill and unable to get out of bed, also wrote a poem to welcome them: "The east wind blows, the red flag waves, teachers and students from Jiaotong University come to Baimiao. In the past, students were afraid of the sun, and a gust of wind could blow them down. Now students are like steel, and everyone is a hero in the summer harvest..." The students participating in the wheat harvest also wrote poems in return: "Entering Baimiao Village, one is intoxicated by the poetic atmosphere. Could it be Li Bai reborn, or Du Fu resurrected? No, this is the crystallization of labor, the people's thoughts are soaring; this is the glory of the era, the epitome of the spiritual outlook of 600 million people."

    When the students completed their summer harvest tasks and were about to leave, the cadres and villagers again bid farewell with poems. Yang Xuanqi said: "Five days of getting along have created deep feelings, hard to part and difficult to separate. Ride the wind and sing triumphant songs back, hoping to meet again with loved ones." Grandpa Jin Shengkuo wrote the poem on a large-character poster as a gift: "The summer harvest battle is busy and bustling, teachers and students sweat through their clothes. Today we send you back to the classroom, tomorrow please taste the abundant grain."

    A Chinese language teacher from Xi'an No. 19 Middle School organized a wheat harvesting group and traveled far to Baimiao. Poems of welcome immediately filled the blackboard newspapers and poetry competition platforms. The young teachers also responded with poems: "Longing to visit Baimiao for a long time, but the opportunity did not come, making people anxious. Supporting the summer harvest in the village of poetry, learning from experience and paying homage to the poets." When supply vehicles supporting the summer harvest arrived in Baimiao, poems were immediately sent to their vehicles. Teachers and students from Xi'an No. 57 Middle School carried more than 3,000 books to support Baimiao Village, and poems, like sugar, were sent into their hearts with boiling water. Thousands of factory and mine workers came to Baimiao to harvest wheat, and poems were immediately printed into briefings, which flew into the hands of the workers like they had grown wings...

    During rest times, if you go to the streets of Baimiao Village, you will see an endless stream of guests, and the streets and alleys are full of people copying poems. At every poetry gathering, I hear the brigade leader Hu Wanji say: "Sorry, we have not taken good care of you, have not paid enough attention, and have nothing else to give as gifts, so let's just say a few rhymes, this is our Baimiao Village's 'ritual conduct'." Ah, what a precious and beautiful "ritual conduct" this is!

　　白庙村的“礼行”
　　李孑
    我来到西安坝桥的白庙村以后，看见了一种新的“礼行”，新的美德，这就是人们彼此之间以送诗为礼。
    夏收以来，帮助白庙村夏收的客人多起来了。社员欢迎客人们用诗，欢送开诗会，交流经验也开诗会，赛诗赠诗，热闹得很。这些“礼行”既不影响生产，又简便易行，深受人们的欢迎。
    西安交通大学的师生支援白庙村割麦来了，村里的人们和各级干部，都不约而同地写诗欢迎。五十八岁的杨宣齐老妈妈说：交大师生到村庄，白庙落满金凤凰，凤凰展翅进麦浪，毛主席思想放金光。
    七十六岁的老大爷金生阔，虽然常年有病不能下炕，但也做诗欢迎：“东风吹，红旗飘，交大师生到白庙，过去学生怕日晒，一阵风来能吹倒，而今学生赛金刚，夏收个个是英豪……”参加麦收的同学们也都写诗回礼：“走进白庙村，诗意醉倒人，莫非李白再世，杜甫重生？不，这是劳动的结晶，人民思想在飞腾；这是时代的光辉，六亿人民精神面貌的典型。”
    同学们完成了夏收任务要走了，干部和社员们又以诗送别。杨宣齐说：“五天相处情谊深，难割难舍又难分，乘风高唱凯歌回，但愿再次会亲人。”金生阔大爷把诗写在一张大字报上，以礼相赠：夏收战斗忙又忙，师生汗水透衣裳，今日送你回课堂，明日请尝丰产粮。
    西安市十九中学的语文教师，组织了一个割麦小组，远奔白庙来了，欢迎的诗歌马上写满了黑板报和赛诗台。年青的教师也以诗答礼：“久久盼望访白庙，机会不到人心焦，支援夏收到诗村，取经学习拜诗人。”支援夏收的供应车到白庙来了，诗歌马上送到了他们车上。西安市五十七中的师生，抬着三千多册书籍，支援白庙村来了，诗歌像沙糖一样，伴着开水送进了他们心里。成千成百的厂矿工人都到白庙割麦来了，诗歌马上印成了简报，像长了翅膀一样，纷纷飞落在工人们手里……。
    在休息的时候，你到白庙村的街上看看，客人络绎不绝，满街满巷都是抄录诗歌的人。每次诗会上，我都要听到大队长胡万吉说：“对不起，照顾不周，关心不到，又没有别的相赠，还是说几句顺口溜吧，这就是我们白庙村的‘礼行’。”是啊，这是多么贵重而美好的“礼行”啊！
