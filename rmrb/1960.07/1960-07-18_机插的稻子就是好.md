　　Machine-Transplanted Rice is Really Good
　　By Our Reporter　You Yanling
　　While Munankuan was still asleep in the hazy night, a group of Zhuang young men and women in Munan Commune, Ningming County, awakened the earth with their loud mountain songs. The early rice was already ripe and yellow. People were seen waving their sickles to harvest, while using rice transplanters to plant rice. In a moment, the golden field was replaced with a verdant new look.
　　Teachers and students from the Guangxi Agricultural College, who came from the capital of the autonomous region to summarize machine-transplanting experience, adopted the "diagonal sampling" method to bring back bundles of machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted rice from the fields. Then they used rulers to measure the plant height and ear length intently. Several girls squatted on the ground patiently counting the grains. Actual and detailed surveys resulted in various contrasting differences between machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted rice:
　　Machine-transplanted rice yielded 178 jin more per mu than hand-transplanted rice, with 63,049 more seedlings per mu, 13 centimeters taller per plant, 5.4% higher effective tillering rate, 93,377 more ears per mu, 28 centimeters longer per ear, 38.1 more grains per ear, 2.7 grams heavier thousand-grain weight, 3.4 days faster greening, and 6.7 days earlier maturity (machine-transplanted maturity was 96.6%, while hand-transplanted maturity was only 81%). The survey form also noted: the same variety was used for both machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted rice, and the various conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil were basically the same. From these comparative figures, everyone could see the unparalleled superiority of machine-transplanting over hand-transplanting.
　　No one doubted that machine-transplanted rice seedlings were transplanted faster and better than hand-transplanted ones. However, to make more people believe that machine-transplanting yielded more than hand-transplanting, the commune Party committee held a field comparison and research meeting of machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted rice in Tianxin Brigade, which had more machine-transplanted fields in the commune, when the early rice started to be harvested. The meeting was attended by old farmers, rice transplanter operators, teachers and students of the Agricultural College, and researchers from the Agricultural Science Institute of the Autonomous Region. This was an evening in June. Li Yuxian, the secretary of the commune Party committee and captain of the rice transplanter team, led everyone to the fields. From afar, people saw the uniformly yellow and ripe rice in the machine-transplanted fields, looking like a golden ocean in the sunset. However, the rice in the hand-transplanted fields was unevenly green and yellow. "The transplanting dates and other conditions of these fields are not much different. Why are the maturity period and the quality of the rice different?" Secretary Li first raised this question to everyone. Although the old farmers had accumulated rich experience in production, they didn't know how to answer this question well. Secretary Li continued: "The key lies in one being machine-transplanted and the other being hand-transplanted. Because the rice transplanter has a certain row spacing and planting depth, the seedlings are transplanted with uniform specifications and even distribution. Each plant has a certain range of nutrient absorption and gaps. Therefore, the rice matures uniformly, with many grains per ear, full grains, and high yield."
　　After Secretary Li finished speaking, people turned around and looked at another experimental field of late rice machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted seedlings. At this time, a student from the Agricultural College dug out a large footprint intact from the dehydrated hand-transplanted field, and a large finger print under a seedling, saying: "From here, we can also see the reason why machine-transplanted rice yields more than hand-transplanted rice. When transplanting rice by hand, the root of the seedling only has one side in contact with the mud, and the other three sides form gaps. It takes a few days for the floating mud to sink and fill the gaps. Therefore, the seedlings green slowly, grow slowly, and have weaker resistance to droughts and other disasters. When using machine-transplanting, the volume of the seedling clip is small. In particular, when the bottom of the rice transplanter moves, it presses the surface fertile mud to both sides, invisibly covering the roots with a layer of mud. Therefore, new roots grow quickly, green quickly, and have stronger resistance to droughts and other disasters." These university students had already conducted comparative surveys of machine-transplanted and hand-transplanted rice during the seedling management stage of early rice. The commune members knew that they were serious in their work, so they praised: "Reasonable, reasonable." The lamp was turned brighter and brighter, and the words were spoken clearer and clearer. Everyone discussed loudly in the fields, one sentence after another. The quiet fields suddenly became extraordinarily active.
　　In this field comparison meeting, there was a not-so-conspicuous Zhuang commune member, Liu Zhenmo. Before this, he didn't pay much attention to rice transplanters. However, when he personally saw the fact that machine-transplanted rice yielded more than hand-transplanted rice, and the reason why machine-transplanting yielded more than hand-transplanting, he couldn't wait to become an excellent rice transplanter immediately.
　　Night fell, and the sky was sprinkled with stars. After the meeting, people went back, but there was still a figure swaying in a field, making "ge zha, ge zha" sounds from time to time. It turned out that Liu Zhenmo was still here alone, trying to figure out how to operate the rice transplanter. Because he was so excited, he wrote a letter of determination to the commune Party committee that night, expressing his determination to learn how to operate the rice transplanter.
　　When we left this commune, we deeply felt a new surge of excitement rolling here again... The workers of the commune's agricultural tool factory, after day and night research, were modifying the originally fixed "Guangxi 59-3 type" rice transplanters, one by one, into new "59-3 type Wuming style" rice transplanters. The rice transplanter operators were also rushing to transplant late rice. Encouraged by the higher yield of machine-transplanted rice over hand-transplanted rice in early rice, almost all of the several thousand mu of mid-season rice and late rice in the commune used rice transplanters for transplanting. Several secretaries of the commune Party committee also took a rice transplanter each, together with the rice transplanter operators, braving the heat of southern China, and transplanted all over the thousands of mountains and valleys under Munankuan.

　　机插的稻子就是好
　　本报记者　游延苓
    睦南关还沉睡在朦胧的夜色之中，宁明县睦南公社一群僮族小伙子和姑娘们便用嘹亮的山歌把大地唤醒了。眼前早稻已经黄熟，只见人们挥舞着镰刀收割，一边用插秧机忙着插秧。一会儿，那金黄色的田野又换上了嫩绿的新装。
    从自治区首府赶来总结机插经验的广西农学院的师生，采取“对角线取样”调查法，从田里抱来了一束束的机插和手插稻，然后用尺子聚精会神地量着株长、穗长；几个姑娘蹲在地上耐心地数着谷粒。实际的精细调查，得出了机插和手插的各种对比差数：
    机插比手插亩产高一百七十八斤，每亩苗数多六万三千零四十九苗，每株高十三厘米，有效分叶率多5.4％，每亩多九万三千三百七十七穗，每穗长二十八厘米，每穗谷粒多三十八点一粒，千粒重多二点七克，回青快三点四天，成熟期早六点七天（机插成熟度是96.6％，手插成熟度仅81％），机插的根分布在二十五厘米，手插的在二十三厘米。调查表里还这样注明：机插、手插秧用的是一个品种，水、肥、土等各种条件基本相同。从这些对比数字里面大家都看出机插比手插的无比优越。
    机插秧比手插秧插得快、插得好，这点再没有人怀疑了。但为了使更多的群众相信机插比手插产量高，公社党委在早稻动手收割的时候，又选择全社机插田较多的田心大队，召开了一个机插、手插秧临田对比研究会。到会的有老农、插秧机手、农学院师生和自治区农业科学研究所的研究人员。这是6月的一个黄昏。公社党委书记、插秧机队长李毓先带着大家来到田野。老远，人们便看到机插田里黄熟一致的稻谷，在夕阳照耀下活像一片金色的海洋。而手插田里的稻谷却青黄不一。“这些田的插秧日期和其他条件都相差不大，为什么成熟期和禾的好坏却不一样呢？”李书记首先向大家提出了这样一个问题。尽管老农们在生产上积蓄了丰富经验，可是，在这个问题上却不知道该怎样回答好。还是李书记接下去说：“关键在于一个是机插秧，一个是手插秧。因插秧机有一定的行距和插植深度，秧苗插下去规格一致，分布均匀，每一蔸禾都有一定的营养吸收范围和空隙，因此禾苗成熟一致，穗穗多粒，粒粒饱满，产量高。”
    李书记说完后，人们不约而同地转身去看看另一垌晚稻机插、手插禾苗对比试验田。这时农学院一个学生从脱水的手插田里原封不动地挖出了一个大脚板印，和一蔸秧下的大手指印说道：“从这里也可以看出机插秧比手插秧增产的原因。用手插秧，秧根仅有一面和泥接触，其他三面形成空隙。需要经过几天，待浮泥下沉才能填满空隙，因此，秧苗回青慢，生长慢，对于干旱等灾害抵抗力也较弱。使用机插，秧夹体积小，特别是插秧机的船底移动时将表面肥泥压向两侧，无形中为秧根培上一层泥，因此新根生长快，回青快，对干旱等灾害抵抗力也较强。”这些大学生早在早稻苗期管理阶段，就在这里作过机插手插秧的对比调查，社员都知道他们办事认真，因此，都啧啧称赞说：“有理，有理。”灯越拨越亮，话越说越明，大家你一句我一句地在田头大声议论开了。宁静的田野，顿时变得格外活跃。
    在这个临田对比会上，有一个并不太引人注目的僮族社员刘振模。在这以前他并不十分注意插秧机。可是当他亲眼见到机插秧比手插秧增产的事实和机插比手插增产的究竟后，他恨不得马上就成为一个优秀的插秧机手。
    夜幕降临了，满天撒上了一片繁星。散会后，人们都回去了，一块田里却还有一个人影摇晃，不时发出“格喳，格喳”的响声。原来刘振模一个人还留在这里琢磨插秧机的操作。由于内心激动，当晚他就一口气给公社党委写下了一张学习插秧机的决心书。
    当我们离开这个公社的时候，深深感觉到一股新的激流又在这里翻滚……公社农具厂的工人们经过日夜钻研，正在把原来定型的“广西59—3型”插秧机，一架架地改制成新型的“59—3型武鸣式”插秧机，插秧机手也正在突击赶插晚稻。在早稻机插比手插增产的鼓舞下，全社几千亩中稻和晚稻几乎全部使用了插秧机插秧。公社的几个党委书记也一人带着一部插秧机和插秧机手一起，冒着南国的酷热，插遍了睦南关下的千山万峒。
