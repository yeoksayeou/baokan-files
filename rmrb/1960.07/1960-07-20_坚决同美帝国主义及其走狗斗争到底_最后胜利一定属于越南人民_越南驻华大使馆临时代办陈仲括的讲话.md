Resolutely Fight the U.S. Imperialists and Their Lackeys to the End
Final Victory Will Surely Belong to the Vietnamese People
Speech by Trần Trọng Quát, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in China

Comrade Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association,
Comrades, Friends:

As we commemorate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, the people of both North and South Vietnam are filled with righteous indignation, fighting against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Ngô Đình Diệm clique, for their sabotage of the Geneva Accords and the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. A surge of anger against U.S. imperialist interference and warmongering is also sweeping across the world. Today, the rally held by people from all walks of life in the capital of China to support the Vietnamese people's opposition to U.S. imperialist aggression and their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland is a powerful encouragement to us. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades and friends present.

After eight or nine years of heroic resistance, the Vietnamese people won the historic victory of Điện Biên Phủ, and on July 20, 1954, the Geneva Accords were signed, thus restoring peace in Indochina. All participating countries at the Geneva Conference guaranteed respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and guaranteed absolutely no interference in the internal affairs of these three countries. This was a major victory for the three Indochinese countries and the peace-loving people of the world.

On the other hand, it was also a disastrous defeat for the colonialist aggressors and all warmongering groups headed by U.S. imperialism, who attempted to prolong and expand the war. Unreconciled to this defeat, the U.S.-Ngô clique's radio station in South Vietnam has in recent days incessantly repeated the absurd tune that the Geneva Accords are merely "a pile of waste paper." Furthermore, they have preposterously claimed that July 20, the date of the signing of the Geneva Accords, is a "day of national humiliation for the Vietnamese people."

This also illustrates the essence of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: although they saw that they could not undermine the Geneva Conference, they were still determined to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

As soon as the Geneva Conference concluded, U.S. imperialism and some Western countries, along with certain Southeast Asian nations, held a meeting in Manila. The Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc was established. At the same time, they immediately intensified their interference in South Vietnam, kicked aside the French colonialists, and fostered the Ngô Đình Diệm regime, plotting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a new colony and military base for U.S. imperialism to prepare for new wars and the so-called "Northward Advance."

The Geneva Accords stipulated that foreign troops and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials, were prohibited from entering both the northern and southern regions of Vietnam, the expansion of military bases was prohibited, and participation in any military alliance was forbidden.

Although U.S. imperialism had declared at the Geneva Conference that it recognized the above-mentioned provisions, it was accustomed to going back on its word. The ink of the Geneva Accords was not yet dry when they were already doing everything possible to sabotage it. The United States, through its "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, controlled the command of the South Vietnamese army. This institution was, in fact, the supreme command of the South Vietnamese army. It had a military staff of more than 2,000 "advisors," equivalent to a regiment, including 300 officers of the rank of general or colonel, while the entire South Vietnamese army had only 352 officers of the rank of general or colonel. The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" directly helped the Ngô Đình Diệm clique to establish a standing army of 353,000 people, including regular troops, militarized police, "security forces," and "civil defense," and another 115,000 reserve troops had been trained and registered. Thus, compared to the 13 million people in South Vietnam, there was an average of one soldier for every thirty people.

To equip these armed forces, U.S. imperialism constantly and secretly transported large quantities of weapons and war materials into South Vietnam. In 1955, they sent 15 ships to transport weapons to South Vietnam, and by 1959, they had sent as many as 551 ships to transport various weapons, ammunition, machinery, vehicles, and fighter planes to South Vietnam. The United States even prepared to transport atomic and rocket weapons to South Vietnam to equip the Ngô Đình Diệm army. According to already published information, since 1954, the total value of weapons the U.S. transported to South Vietnam was $424,181,000. Of course, this figure is still far from the truth. At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities had to spend even more money to serve their military purposes. Every year, more and more military airfields, military ports, barracks, concentration camps, strategic highways, and so-called "agrovilles" were established throughout South Vietnam.

The deputy head of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, Myers Liggett, once stated, "Without the South Vietnamese army, the United States would have to use American soldiers to defend this fortress (i.e., South Vietnam), and using American soldiers would cost the United States five times as much money." The plague god Eisenhower also clamored: "South Vietnam must be defended, because South Vietnam is the outpost of the free world in Southeast Asia. Losing South Vietnam would threaten the interests of another 150 million people in the free world." Ngô Đình Diệm also announced: "The borders of the United States extend to the 17th parallel" (i.e., the current temporary military demarcation line in Vietnam), and he constantly clamored about "Northward Advance." The above facts have shown that the U.S.'s crimes of undermining the Geneva Accords have posed a serious threat to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

To realize its conspiracy of aggression and instigation of war, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Ngô Đình Diệm clique, intensified the persecution and massacre of the people of South Vietnam. The Geneva Accords stipulated that "Each party guarantees that there will be no reprisals or discrimination in the regrouping zone assigned to its side against persons and organizations that collaborated with the other party during the war." However, the U.S.-Ngô clique is carrying out all kinds of so-called "anti-communist" campaigns, continuously dispatching armed forces in divisions to conduct military "sweeps" everywhere, and promulgated Decree No. 10 in 1959 to establish "Special Military Courts" and build new types of concentration camps called "dense areas" and "agrovilles" in order to persecute and take revenge on former resistance personnel, people who love their motherland and love peace in South Vietnam. They employed extremely barbaric punishments of the Middle Ages, such as gouging out eyes, cutting off tongues, disemboweling, removing livers, beheading and displaying corpses to the public, raping women, leveling villages, poisoning in the Phú Lợi concentration camp, and mass slaughtering thousands of people. In the past six years, according to incomplete statistics, more than 240,000 people have been arrested and imprisoned, severely tortured to the point of disability or killed. Among the 13 million people in South Vietnam, an average of one in ten people has suffered persecution by the U.S.-Ngô clique, and an average of one in three families has suffered misfortune, disaster, and imprisonment. The people of South Vietnam have been living in terror, hunger, unemployment, and the disasters of American "culture," such as hooliganism, prostitution, gambling, and alcoholism. The barbaric methods of the U.S.-Ngô clique are unimaginable.

It is rare in the history of the world that people still have to live such a dark life in a peaceful environment.

Due to the above-mentioned policies of the U.S.-Ngô clique, although peace has been restored in Vietnam for six years, the goal of holding free general elections throughout Vietnam to reunify the motherland, as stipulated by the Geneva Accords, has not yet been achieved today. The state of division of Vietnam has been prolonged for six years, which is still a painful matter for every Vietnamese who loves his motherland. Tens of thousands of families in North and South Vietnam are still living apart, and their husbands and wives, mothers and children, relatives cannot be reunited.

Under these circumstances, the people of South Vietnam have had to stand up to wage unremitting struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, just as they once stood up against French imperialism and its lackeys, just as the people of various oppressed countries in the world have risen up in the past and are rising up now to fight against the traitorous acts of imperialism and its lackeys.

At present, the flames of the South Vietnamese people's struggle have caused the collapse of the ruling factions, "civil defense," and various vicious special agent organizations in the villages and hamlets who are serving as pawns of the U.S.-Ngô clique. In the U.S.-Ngô clique's army, the movement of desertion and refusal to suppress the masses is growing. In many places, the people have taken back the land that was once occupied by the U.S.-Ngô clique and the ferocious landlord class. Thousands of so-called "dense areas" of the U.S.-Ngô clique have been successively destroyed. The struggle movement to demand improvement of life, to demand democracy and freedom, the self-defense struggle movement to demand the protection of their own right to survival, and the struggle movement to demand the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and the peaceful reunification of the motherland are developing vigorously in the cities and countryside and mountainous areas of South Vietnam. The united front against the U.S.-Ngô clique is expanding.

Where there is oppression, there will inevitably be struggle. As long as oppression continues to exist, struggle will inevitably continue uninterrupted. This is a universal law. The South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is a matter of course. The history of the national liberation movement in Vietnam and other countries in the world has proven this.

Recently, U.S. imperialism and its servants often say that the patriotic struggle movement in South Vietnam is created by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. That is to say, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is carrying out activities to "subvert" the regime of South Vietnam. U.S. imperialism is a robber who "cries, 'Stop thief!'" It is both fierce and cunning and treacherous. They fabricate facts to slander the patriotic movement of the South Vietnamese people, just as they have consistently slandered the people of various countries in the world. Therefore, it has further exposed their ferocious faces. The people of various countries in the world will hate them even more, and will more actively fight against them.

Since World War II, due to the growth and strengthening of the socialist camp, the national liberation movement has risen and expanded further, and has profoundly influenced hundreds of millions of people in oppressed countries, the colonial system has been on the verge of collapse. Imperialism is doing everything possible to maintain its dominant position, but their rights and influence have been fundamentally shaken. They are intensifying their activities of aggression, interference, and subversion. They are precisely the criminals who are carrying out subversion everywhere in the world.

In recent months, massive struggle movements have erupted in countries around the world, such as South Korea, Turkey, and Japan. The imperialists, especially U.S. imperialism, are sitting uneasily on many volcanoes in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Some of these volcanoes are erupting fiercely, and some have not yet erupted or are brewing, but one day they will erupt.

Those who play with fire will get burned! The more evils imperialism and its lackeys accumulate, the more the people of the world will unite to fight, without anyone needing to instigate them, and defeat the imperialist aggressors one by one.

Therefore, the struggle against the U.S.-Ngô clique for peace and unification, for the right to live, for national independence, democracy, and freedom in South Vietnam is an inevitable trend.

It is not surprising that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys slander us. However, it is regrettable if the International Commission also has such arguments. Since the restoration of peace, the Vietnam International Commission has made efforts to supervise and monitor the implementation of the Geneva Accords. We welcome such efforts because we earnestly demand the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords and hope to achieve effective cooperation with the International Commission.

On April 25, 1960, the Vietnam International Commission, ignoring the opposition of the Polish representative, passed a resolution allowing the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" to double its military personnel under the pretext of a majority vote. Despite the fierce opposition of the Polish representative, the International Commission also made the erroneous resolution that Decree No. 10 of 1959, which was specifically promulgated to persecute former resistance personnel, was irrelevant to the Geneva Accords. Therefore, we cannot but say that these resolutions are in complete violation of the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Accords. It paves the way for U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam, thereby increasing the serious threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always been unswervingly loyal to the highest interests of the Vietnamese people. Therefore, in order to correctly implement the Geneva Accords, we have consistently waged unremitting struggles. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has taken the initiative to propose or implement various positive and constructive measures. For example: suggesting that the two sides conduct consultations within the statutory period to discuss free general elections and the reunification of the country; suggesting that people in the two regions have free movement, free trade, and free communication; suggesting that both sides reduce troops, reduce defense expenditures, and not participate in military alliances; and suggesting that the two regions conduct propaganda for peace and national unity. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has taken the initiative to reduce 80,000 troops between 1956 and 1957, and is still continuing to gradually reduce the defense budget. From 22% of the total national budget in 1956, it decreased to 17.3% in 1959.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to unswervingly pursue the policy of peaceful reunification and wage unremitting struggles for the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords. At present, it is necessary to immediately stop U.S. imperialist interference and provocative policies in South Vietnam; to demand that the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group immediately get out of South Vietnam; to demand that the persecution and retaliatory measures adopted against former resistance personnel and against people who love their motherland and love peace be stopped immediately. To demand that the South Vietnamese regime must consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to organize free general elections for the purpose of unifying the motherland.

This policy has been warmly supported by all the Vietnamese people. The people of North Vietnam are uniting around the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, actively building socialism and a peaceful life in North Vietnam as a backing for the struggle to unify the motherland.

Our struggle has received the warm support and selfless assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the people and governments of many Asian and African countries and the peace-loving people of the world have expressed sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The Chinese people and the Chinese government are close comrades-in-arms and faithful comrades of the Vietnamese people, and have always been concerned about and fully supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and unification. At the same time, China is a participating country in the Geneva Conference, and it has made significant contributions to the achievements of the Geneva Conference and to the continuous struggle for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. This has strengthened the confidence and strength of the Vietnamese people, and further doubled their determination to launch the struggle until they win the final victory. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the comrades participating in the conference on behalf of the Vietnamese people, and to convey our deep gratitude to the Chinese people through you.

The Vietnamese people always stand with the fraternal Chinese people to resolutely oppose the crime of U.S. imperialism in creating "two Chinas." Taiwan is the sacred and inviolable territory of the Chinese people, and it must be returned to the Chinese people. We are deeply convinced that the powerful 650 million Chinese people, closely united around the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will surely drive the American robbers out of Taiwan, and will surely liberate Taiwan. The iron-like determination of the Chinese people cannot be blocked by any reactionary force.

Comrades, friends, we realize that the Vietnamese people's struggle is still in a tense and complex situation, but thanks to the increasing support of many friends, the Vietnamese people believe that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the traitorous Ngô Đình Diệm clique, will surely suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people. Vietnam will surely be unified!

Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples!
Long live the unity and friendship of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples against the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism!
U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam!
U.S. imperialism get out of China's sacred territory of Taiwan!
Long live a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam!
Long live world peace!

　　坚决同美帝国主义及其走狗斗争到底
    最后胜利一定属于越南人民
　　越南驻华大使馆临时代办陈仲括的讲话
    新华社19日讯　越南民主共和国驻华大使馆临时代办陈仲括在首都各界人民支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    中国越南友好协会会长杨秀峰同志，
    同志们，朋友们：
    当纪念日内瓦协议签订六周年的时候，越南北方和南方的全体人民正在群情激愤地为反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议和破坏和平统一越南而进行斗争；世界各国人民反对美帝国主义干涉和战争挑衅的怒潮也正在到处汹涌澎湃。今天，中国首都各界人民所举行的支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国大会，对我们来说是一个强有力的鼓舞。我们谨在这里对同志们和朋友们表示衷心的感谢。
    越南人民经过八、九年的英勇抗战，在赢得了具有历史性的奠边府战役胜利的基础上，于1954年7月20日签订了日内瓦协议，因而恢复了印度支那的和平。参加日内瓦会议的各国都保证尊重越南、柬埔寨、老挝的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并且保证绝对不干涉这三个国家的内政。这是印度支那三国和世界爱好和平人民的重大胜利。
    另一方面，它也是以美帝国主义为首的殖民主义侵略者和一切好战集团企图延长和扩大战争阴谋的惨重失败。他们不甘心于这个失败，在越南南方的美吴集团的广播电台于最近几天喋喋不休地重弹什么日内瓦协议仅是“一堆废纸”的滥调。并且胡说什么7月20日这一日内瓦协议签字的日子是“越南人民的国耻日”。
    这一点也可以说明了美帝国主义及其走狗的本质：他们虽然看到破坏不了日内瓦会议，可是它们仍然坚决地要破坏日内瓦协议的履行。
    当日内瓦会议刚一闭幕的时候，美帝国主义和一些西方国家以及某些东南亚国家就在马尼拉举行会议。成立了东南亚军事侵略集团。同时他们立即加强对越南南方的干涉，把法国殖民主义者一脚踢开，扶植起吴庭艳政权，阴谋长期分裂越南，把越南南方变成美帝国主义准备挑起新的战争，和准备所谓“北进”的新的殖民地和军事基地。
    日内瓦协议规定，禁止外国军队和军事人员以及各种武器弹药等战争物资进入越南北南两个地区，禁止增建军事基地和不得参加任何军事同盟。
    美帝国主义虽然曾在日内瓦会议上声明承认上述的条款，但是它惯于翻脸不认账。当日内瓦协议的墨迹未干，他们就已经千方百计地进行破坏。美国通过它在越南南方的
  “军事援助顾问团”掌握着对越南南方军队的指挥权。这个机构事实上是越南南方军队的最高指挥部。它拥有等于一个团的二千多名“顾问”的军事人员，其中包括三百名的将校级军官，而整个越南南方军队却只有三百五十二名将校级军官。“美国军事援助顾问团”已直接帮助吴庭艳集团建立了一支包括正规军、军事化警察、“保安团”和“民卫队”等军事组织的三十五万三千人的常备军队，另外还有十一万五千名后备军队已经得到训练和登记。这样如果和越南南方一千三百万人口相比较，那么平均每三十个人中就有一名士兵。
    为了装备这些武装力量，美帝国主义不断偷偷地把大批武器和战争物资运进越南南方。1955年他们派遣了十五艘次舰船把武器运入越南南方，而到1959年他们竟派遣了五百五十一艘次的舰船把各种武器弹药、机械、车辆和战斗机运进越南南方。美国甚至还准备把原子、火箭武器运进越南南方来装备吴庭艳军队。根据已经公布的消息表明，自从1954年以来美国运进越南南方的武器价值总共四亿二千四百一十八万一千美元。当然这个数字和事实还相差很远。同时，越南南方当局还必须花费更多的金钱来为他们的军事目的服务。每年都有愈来愈多的军用机场、军港、兵营、集中营、战略公路以及所谓
  “垦植区”等在越南南方各地建立起来。
    在越南南方的“美国军事援助顾问团”副团长迈尔斯·塞廖尔曾经说明：“如果没有越南南方的军队，美国就只好用美国士兵来保卫这个堡垒（即越南南方），而使用美国士兵将使美国多花费五倍的金钱”。瘟神艾森豪威尔也竭力叫嚣：“必须保卫越南南方，因为越南南方是自由世界在东南亚的前哨。失掉越南南方将使其他一亿五千万的自由世界人民的利益受到威胁”。吴庭艳也曾经宣布：“美国的边界伸展到十七度线”（即目前越南临时军事分界线），同时他还不断地叫嚣什么“北进”。上述事实已说明美国破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，已给印度支那和东南亚和平造成了严重的威胁。
    为了实现其侵略和挑拨战争的阴谋，美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团加紧对越南南方人民的迫害和屠杀。日内瓦协议规定：“每方保证在划归自己一方的集结区内对战时曾与对方合作的人员和团体不加任何的报复和歧视。”但是美吴集团正进行各种所谓“控共”战役，连接不断地派遣成师的武装力量，到处进行军事“扫荡”，并颁布了1959年第十号法令成立“特别军事法庭”，建立所谓“稠密区”和“垦植区”的新型集中营，以便对越南南方前抗战人员、热爱祖国热爱和平的人们进行迫害和报复。他们采用了中世纪的挖眼、割舌、剖腹、掏肝、斩首示众、奸淫妇女、夷平村庄、在富利集中营投毒、集体屠杀成千人等极其野蛮的刑罚。六年来，根据不完全的统计已有二十四万多人被逮捕囚禁、被严刑拷打以致残废或被杀害。在一千三百万越南南方人民中，平均每十个人中就有一个人遭受美吴集团的迫害，平均每三个家庭中就有一个家庭遭到不幸的灾难和囚禁。越南南方人民一直生活在恐怖、饥饿、失业和美国“文化”，如阿飞、娼妓、赌博、酗酒等毒害的灾难中，美吴集团野蛮的手段是令人难以想像的。
    在和平环境里，人民群众仍然要过着这样黑暗的生活，这是世界历史上所少见的。
    由于美吴集团的上述政策，越南的和平虽然已经恢复六年了，但是按照日内瓦协议的规定在越南全国范围内举行自由普选以统一祖国的目的直到今天还没有实现。越南被分割的状态已经拖延六年了，这是每一个热爱祖国的越南人民至今还感到伤痛的事，越南北南两个地区的成万个家庭至今尚过着彼此分离的生活，他们的夫妻、母子、亲戚还不能团聚。
    在这种情况下，越南南方人民不得不站起来为反对美帝国主义及其走狗而进行不懈的斗争，正如他们过去曾经站起来反对法帝国主义及其走狗一样，正如过去和现在世界上各个被压迫国家的人民已经和正在纷纷起来为反对帝国主义及其走狗的卖国行为而进行斗争一样。
    目前，越南南方人民的斗争火焰已促使充当美吴集团走狗的各乡、各邑的当权派，“民卫队”和各个穷凶恶极的特务组织土崩瓦解。在美吴集团的军队中，开小差和拒绝对人民群众进行镇压的运动正在日益高涨。在许多地方，人民群众已经夺回了曾经一度被美吴集团和凶悍的地主阶级所霸占的土地。成千个美吴集团的所谓“稠密区”，已经陆续遭到摧毁。要求改善生活、要求民主自由的斗争运动，要求保卫自己本身的生存权利的自卫斗争运动，要求严正地履行日内瓦协议，要求和平统一祖国的斗争运动正在越南南方的城乡、山区日益蓬勃地发展着。反对美吴集团斗争的统一战线正在日益扩展中。
    有压迫就必然会有斗争。只要压迫继续存在，斗争就必然会不间断地进行着。这是一个普遍的规律。越南南方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争是理所当然的事情。越南和世界各国人民的民族解放运动的历史已证明了这一点。
    最近，美帝国主义及其仆从们常说什么越南南方的爱国斗争运动是越南民主共和国所制造的。这样也就是说，越南民主共和国政府在进行“颠复”越南南方政权的活动。美帝国主义就是“贼喊捉贼”的强盗，它既凶恶而又狡猾奸险。他们捏造事实，对越南南方人民的爱国运动进行诬蔑，也和他们曾经一贯对世界各国人民进行诬蔑一样。因此，也就更加暴露了他们的狰狞面目。世界各国人民将更加憎恨他们，并且将更加积极地对他们进行斗争。
    自从第二次世界大战以来，由于社会主义阵营的成长和壮大，民族解放运动更加高涨扩展，并且日益深刻地影响成亿被压迫国家的人民，殖民主义体系已经濒于崩溃。帝国主义正在千方百计地维持它们的统治地位，但是他们的权利和影响已从根本上发生动摇。他们正在加紧进行侵略、干涉和颠复活动。他们才正是在世界各地到处搞颠复活动的罪犯。
    最近几个月来，世界上爆发了南朝鲜、土耳其和日本等国人民的声势浩大的斗争运动。各帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义正不安地坐在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多火山上，这些火山有的正在熊熊地喷出怒火，有的一时还未爆发或正在酝酿着，可是终有一天它会喷出怒火来的。
    玩火者必自焚！帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶积聚愈多，那么世界人民无须谁来鼓动也会日益团结起来作斗争，并且逐个打垮帝国主义侵略者。
    因此，在越南南方反对美吴集团要求和平和统一，要求生活权利，要求民族独立、民主自由等斗争是必然的趋势。
    美帝国主义和它的走狗对我们的污蔑是不足为怪的。但是，如果国际委员会也有这样的论调，那是令人遗憾的事。自从恢复和平至今，越南国际委员会在监督和监察执行日内瓦协议方面曾经作出努力。我们欢迎这种努力，因为我们恳切地要求正确履行日内瓦协议，并且希望和国际委员会取得效果良好的合作。
    越南国际委员会于1960年4月25日不顾波兰代表的反对，竟以多数为借口，通过一个允许“美国军事援助顾问团”增加一倍军事人员的决议。尽管被波兰代表予以激烈反对，而国际委员会还做出专为迫害前抗战人员而颁布的1959年第十号法令和日内瓦协议无关的错误决议。因此，我们不能不这样说，这些决议是完全违反了日内瓦协议的条文和精神的。它给美帝国主义干涉越南南方铺平道路，从而增长了对越南民主共和国的安全以及对印度支那和东南亚的和平的严重威胁。
    越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地忠实于越南人民最高的利益，因此我们为了正确地执行日内瓦协议，我们始终如一地进行不懈的斗争。越南民主共和国政府已主动地提出或执行各种积极的、建设性的办法。例如：建议按照法定期间双方进行协商以讨论自由普选和统一国家的事宜；建议让两个地区人民自由来往，自由贸易和自由通讯；建议两方都裁减军队、减少国防经费开支，不参加军事联盟；建议两个地区进行和平与民族团结的宣传工作。越南民主共和国政府已于1956年—1957年间主动地裁减八万名军队，现在仍然在继续逐步减少国防经费预算。从1956年占国家总预算的22％降到1959年的17.3％。
    越南民主共和国政府将继续始终不渝地奉行和平统一的政策，并为正确履行日内瓦协议进行不懈的斗争。目前是要求立即制止美帝国主义在越南南方的干涉和挑衅政策；要求美国军事援助顾问团立即从南越滚出去；要求立即停止对前抗战人员和对爱祖国爱和平的人士所采用的迫害和报复手段。要求南越政权必须和越南民主共和国政府进行协商，以利组织目的在于统一祖国的自由普选。
    这个政策已获得全体越南人民的热烈支持。越南北方人民正团结在越南民主共和国政府的周围，在北越积极建设社会主义与和平的生活作为统一祖国斗争的后盾。
    我们的斗争事业已得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的热烈支持和无私的帮助，许多亚非国家的人民和政府以及世界爱好和平的人民曾经对越南人民正义的斗争表示同情和支持。
    中国人民和中国政府是越南人民亲密的战友和忠实的同志，一向关心和全力支持越南人民争取独立和统一的斗争。同时中国是日内瓦会议的参加国，它对日内瓦会议的取得成就和为彻底履行日内瓦协议不断地进行了斗争，做出了重大的贡献。这就加强了越南人民的信心和力量，进而加倍坚决地展开斗争，一直到赢得最后的胜利。今天借此机会，我谨代表越南人民向参加大会的同志们表示衷心的感谢，并通过你们向中国人民转达我们深切的谢意。
    越南人民始终和兄弟般的中国人民一起坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪行。台湾是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的领土，它必须归还中国人民。我们深信，力量雄厚的六亿五千万中国人民密切地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的周围，一定会把美国强盗从台湾赶出去，一定要解放台湾，中国人民钢铁般的决心是任何反动力量所不能加以拦阻的。
    同志们，朋友们，我们认识到越南人民的斗争还处在紧张和复杂的情况下，但由于日益得到众多朋友的支持，越南人民相信，美帝国主义和它的走狗、卖国的吴庭艳集团一定会遭到可耻的失败。最后胜利一定是属于越南人民的。越南一定会统一！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结友谊万岁！
    反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的亚非人民的团结力量万岁！
    美帝国主义从南越滚出去！
    美帝国主义从中国神圣的领土台湾滚出去！
    和平、统一、独立民主和富强的越南万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
