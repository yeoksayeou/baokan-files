Camping Songs (Four Songs)
Soldier Liu Jinglin

    Stringing Lines
    A refreshing breeze blows from the horizon,
    Green waves surge to the sky.
    What a vast ocean,
    Why are there no white sails?
    Soldiers circle like eagles,
    Stringing ten thousand silver lines.
    Songs echo in mid-air,
    Red flags flutter in the white clouds.

    Climbing
    A winding path hangs on the mountain cliff,
    Soldiers climb with joyous hearts.
    Hands tear at cloud fragments,
    The whole body draped in colorful glow.
    The east wind stirs heroic courage,
    Mount Baitou is nothing to fear,
    A string of sweat, a line of poetry,
    A footprint, a flower.

    Encampment
    Pitching tents on Changbai Mountain,
    Mountains, rivers, and dense forests are our home,
    Smoke from red pine bark fires,
    Kisses the evening glow.
    The mess kit is filled with "Heavenly Lake water,"
    Boiling and bubbling,
    Hunted wild chickens emit fragrance,
    Camping life is full of flavor.

    Camping Evening Party
    A round moon acts as a sentry,
    The evening breeze feels refreshing.
    Add another handful of dry branches,
    Burn the bonfire even brighter.
    The instructor and company commander sing in unison,
    Soldiers clap their hands with joy.
    First sing a song of the heroic sons and daughters fighting Taihang,
    Then sing of the dawn crossing of the Songhua River.

    野营曲（四首）
    战士　刘景林
    架线清风阵阵从天边吹来，绿色的波浪滔天。好一片汪洋大海，为何不见白帆？战士似苍鹰盘旋，架起万条银线。半空里歌声回荡，白云中红旗招展。
    攀登羊肠小道山崖挂，战士攀登心开花。双手扯云片，全身披彩霞。东风鼓起英雄胆，白头山不在话下，一串汗珠一行诗，一个脚印一朵花。
    宿营长白山上搭帐棚，山川密林就是家，红松树皮的炊烟，吻着晚霞。行军锅里盛满“天池水”，烧的翻花，猎来的山鸡散发着香气，野营生活风味佳。
    野营晚会一轮明月当哨兵，晚风吹来精神爽。再加进一把枯枝，把篝火烧得更旺。指导员和连长合唱，战士乐的拍巴掌。先歌一曲英雄儿女战太行，又唱一个黎明抢渡松花江。
