    Cotton Cloth Rental Counter
    The Kuming Chuncheng Store and the Huashan Central Store have established two cotton cloth rental counters. In the past two months, they have rented out more than 10,000 meters of cotton cloth to more than 90 factories, enterprises, and organizations, solving the temporary cloth needs of these units for cloth banners and other items used during meetings and exhibitions. According to statistics from the Kunming Knitwear Wholesale Store, the supply of cloth for propaganda purposes during this year's "May Day" festival decreased by 80% compared to last year.

    棉布租赁专柜
    昆明春城商店和华山中心商店成立了两个棉布租赁门市专柜，两个多月来，已向九十多个工厂、企业、机关租出了一万多米棉布，解决了这些单位召开会议、举办展览时所用布标等的临时用布问题。据昆明市针织品批发商店统计，今年“五一”节供应宣传用布较去年减少80％。
