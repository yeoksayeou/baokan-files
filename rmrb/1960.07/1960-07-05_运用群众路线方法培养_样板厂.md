Cultivating "Model Factories" Using the Mass Line Method
Chen Hui, Director of the Industrial Department of the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee

    In the upsurge of deeply developing the technical revolution movement and the competition to learn from Shanghai in the east and catch up with Nanjing in the west, Suzhou City, using the mass line method, has cultivated more than twenty model factories. This group of model factories are the best factories within an industry or district that adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements. They are the factories that best and fastest fulfill state plans, achieve "one top of several," and develop production. They are the factories that best carry out technical revolutions and improve the degree of "four modernizations," and are also good at supporting agriculture, improving leadership style, and developing all aspects of work. They have all, in the past month or so, under the encouragement and help of Party committees at all levels, adhered to continuous revolution, determined to strive for self-improvement, made outstanding achievements, and been recognized by the masses as model factories. After the emergence of these model factories, the Municipal Party Committee, using the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements, launched a "be like the model factories" movement throughout the city. Now all factories and mines in the city are learning from the models, catching up with the models, and surpassing the models, setting off a competitive upsurge of catching up with each other.
    Using the mass line method to cultivate models is a measure taken by the Municipal Party Committee in constantly improving leadership methods, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees. With the rapid development of the technical revolution movement, the contradiction between work methods not keeping up with the situation has become increasingly prominent: various innovations and creations are emerging like mushrooms after rain, and new experiences and new creations are constantly emerging. Relying on exhibitions and on-site meetings can no longer meet the needs of the masses to quickly promote and universally blossom and bear fruit; some units have taken this step, but cannot see the next step, and have produced "reaching the top" thinking, requiring high-standard living examples to specifically point out the direction and promote their continuous progress. At the same time, political work, mass movements, production management, etc. in factories and mines also need living examples to guide them, and so on. In short, the original general work methods have been unable to adapt to the needs of the new situation. In order to solve this contradiction and explore a work method that is in line with this excellent situation, the Municipal Party Committee decided to create "living models" and hold "living exhibitions," which have both current requirements and high-standard directions. Not only are they models in terms of technical revolution, but also in other aspects, striving to concentrate and coordinate various experiences as much as possible to promote the continuous development of the movement.
    After repeated research and summarizing the experience of past leadership methods, the Municipal Party Committee has universally cultivated living models in all departments such as steel, coking, machinery, instrumentation, chemical industry, light industry, food, textile, crafts, daily hardware, as well as transportation and basic construction.
    First, the Party committees selected thirty-two units from the original advanced units and those that are not advanced but have the potential to catch up quickly as objects for cultivating and striving to become models, telling them the conditions for becoming models, fully mobilizing the masses to establish lofty ambitions, and formulating plans for becoming model factories. On this basis, the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting to establish ambitions to strive to become model factories, further pointing out the direction, exchanging experiences, holding competitions, and revising and implementing plans. Each unit has both the direction for this year and the recent specific goals, mobilizing the masses to focus on current production.
    In the process of these units realizing their plans, the responsible leadership departments in the urban area have special personnel to contact them, understand and help them solve some difficulties and problems that they cannot solve themselves. When deploying work, these units always take the first step, promoting them to strive to become models in all aspects. In order to promote them to accelerate their pace, the Municipal Party Committee organized representatives from these thirty-two units to go to the "models" among them to learn and inspect, hold on-site meetings on the spot, inspire each other, and promote the well-doing units to continue to improve, and the poorly-doing units to catch up.
    Using the mass line method to cultivate models, and using these models as locomotives to drive others, is a concrete application of the basic leadership method of combining the general and the individual, combining leadership and the masses, and going from the masses to the masses, as instructed by Chairman Mao. The effects already achieved prove that adopting this work method has many benefits.
    Adopting the mass line method to cultivate models is an effective form of combining the leadership's intention to cultivate typical examples and establish models with the aspirations of the broad masses to strive for advancement, thus making the models have a solid ideological foundation and mass base, greatly promoting the maturation process of the models. The Suzhou Knitting Underwear Factory was not an advanced unit in the textile system in early May. After participating in the city's ambition-setting conference, they vigorously grasped the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation work, quickly increasing the utilization rate of innovation projects in the factory from the original 58% to 98%, thereby ensuring the early completion of half of the annual plan. Now this factory has become the best model factory in the entire system. The leadership method of grasping advanced examples and establishing models has also been frequently used in the past, but not as planned and systematic as it is now. In the past, two methods were generally adopted: one was to send working groups to focus on cultivation; the other was to conduct regular evaluations and use the red flag units that were evaluated as models to call on everyone to learn. The former mainly relies on external forces to promote, which takes a lot of effort and is not easy to consolidate. Often, when the working group leaves, the model also collapses. The latter mainly relies on natural formation, which is not easy to improve. This time, the method of combining leadership and the masses, combining internal and external factors, but mainly relying on internal factors to cultivate models, did not take much effort. In just about a month, more than twenty relatively mature model factories were cultivated in various industries, which was unimaginable in the past.
    At present, this group of model factories is playing the role of locomotives, leading all units to continuously revolutionize and strive for advancement. After the heavy industry system evaluated the Suzhou Machine Tool Factory and the Agricultural Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory as two model factories, it immediately launched a competitive upsurge of learning from the models, catching up with the models, and surpassing the models throughout the system. Each unit mobilized the masses to set lofty ambitions, visit and learn from the model factories, establish counterpart links, and determine specific goals for learning and catching up. The Suzhou Bearing Factory was originally one of the most backward units in the city. Now, under the promotion of the model factories, they proposed the slogan of "doubling production in June and comprehensively surpassing the model in July." In early June, production increased by two or three times compared with the same period last month. At the same time, the two model factories set greater ambitions, continuously revolutionize, and recently went everywhere to learn from advanced experiences, fill gaps, overcome their weaknesses, and strive to reach a higher level. Through the locomotive role of the model factories, the further development of the learning, comparing, catching up, helping, and competing movement has been greatly promoted, making the competition movement of learning from Shanghai in the east and catching up with Nanjing in the west, centered on the technical revolution, more concrete.
    Using the mass line method to cultivate models is a major progress in leadership methods, and these model factories have further promoted the improvement of leadership style. Many model factories have become the foothold for leadership organs in urban areas to work in factories. Leadership intentions are personally practiced in these model factories to gain experience. The model factories further develop to high standards, which also promotes leaders to broaden their horizons, have foresight, see more new things, and see the prospects for the development of the movement. In this way, the leadership work can always stand at the forefront of the movement and correctly guide the development of the movement.
    The mass line cultivation of models and the "one like" movement arising from it are currently rapidly unfolding throughout the city. Many factories and mining enterprises have also launched the "one like" movement to emulate model workshops, model groups, and model individuals in the same way, creating a production situation in which everyone has lofty ambitions, everyone strives to become a model, and everything is balanced towards the most advanced and looks to high standards. This movement, like any new thing, has strong vitality. Promoting its development will greatly promote the advancement of our work. Taking a group of models as a guide, driving other units to catch up with it, and then a group of model factories appear, and other units catch up with it again. Catching up once and improving once, in this way, more units can be quickly promoted to an advanced level and continuously develop in a higher direction. Recently, the Municipal Party Committee summarized its experience in this area and required that this method be widely used to carry out the "one like" movement in all departments and all factories and mining enterprises throughout the city. At the same time, develop and cultivate single-item models. Fully utilize the law of "latecomers surpassing the old-timers" to promote the city's increase production and conserve economy movement centered on technical revolution to stride forward.

    运用群众路线方法培养“样板厂”
    中共苏州市委工业部部长　陈晖
    苏州市在深入发展技术革命运动和东学上海、西赶南京的竞赛浪潮中，运用群众路线的方法，培养出二十多个样板工厂。这批样板厂，是在一个行业、一个区内，坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动最好的工厂，是完成国家计划、实现“一顶几”、生产发展最好最快的工厂，是开展技术革命最好、“四化”程度提高最快的工厂，也是支援农业、改进领导作风、各项工作全面发展较好的工厂。他们都是在最近一个多月来，在各级党委的鼓励和帮助下，坚持不断革命，立志发愤图强，做出卓越成绩，经过群众性的鉴定、公认，而当上样板厂的。在这些样板厂出现以后，市委又以大搞群众运动的方法，在全市开展“和样板厂一个样”运动。现在全市各个厂矿都在学样板、赶样板、超样板，掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮。
    运用群众路线的方法培养样板，这是市委根据党中央和省、地委的指示，在不断改进领导方法中采取的一项措施。随着技术革命运动的迅猛发展，工作方法跟不上形势的矛盾越来越突出：各种革新创造犹如雨后春笋，新经验、新创造不断涌现，如何迅速地推广开去，使之普遍开花结果，依靠展览会和现场会已不能满足群众的要求；有些单位走了这一步，看不到下一步，产生“到顶”思想，需要有高标准的活榜样来具体指明方向，促使他们不断前进；同时，厂矿中的政治工作、群众运动、生产管理等也须有活的样板来指导，等等。总之，原来一般化的工作方法已经不能适应新形势的需要。为了解决这个矛盾，摸索一个与这种大好形势相适应的多快好省的工作方法，市委决定搞“活样板”，办“活展览会”，既有现在的要求，又有高标准的方向。不仅在技术革命方面是样板，在其他方面也是样板，尽可能地使各方面的经验集中配套，拧成一股绳，以利于推动运动的不断发展。
    市委经过多次研究和总结了以往领导方法的经验，在全市钢铁、焦化、机械、仪表、化工、轻工、食品、纺织、工艺、日用五金，以及交通运输和基本建设等各个部门都普遍培养活的样板。
    首先由各党委在原有的先进单位和目前虽不够先进、但有可能很快赶上来的单位中，选出了三十二个单位作为培养争当样板的对象，告诉他们当样板的条件，充分发动群众树立雄心壮志，制订当样板厂的规划。在此基础上，市委召开了争当样板厂的立志大会，进一步指出方向，交流经验，擂台比武，修订落实规划。每个单位都做到既有今年的方向，又有最近的具体目标，发动群众狠抓当前的生产。
    在这些单位实现规划的过程中，市区各主管领导部门都有专人和他们联系，了解和帮助他们解决一些自己不能解决的困难和问题。布置工作的时候，都是在这些单位先走一步，促进他们在各方面都争当样板。为了促进他们加快步伐，市委组织这三十二个单位的代表，到他们中间的“样板”那里去学习检查，就地开现场会，相互启发，促使干得好的单位继续提高，干得差的单位迎头赶上。
    运用群众路线的方法培养样板，和以这些样板为火车头来带动其他，这是根据毛主席指示的一般和个别相结合、领导和群众相结合、从群众中来到群众中去的基本领导方法的具体运用。从已有的效果证明，采用这种工作方法有很多好处。
    采用群众路线方法培养样板，是把培养典型，树立样板的领导意图和广大群众力争上游的意愿结合起来的有效形式，因而使样板具有巩固的思想基础和群众基础，大大促进了样板的成熟过程。苏州针织内衣厂，5月初在纺织系统中还不是一个先进单位，在参加全市的立志会议以后，他们雷厉风行地狠抓技术革新的巩固、推广、提高工作，使全厂革新项目的使用率从原来的58％很快提高到98％，从而保证提前完成了全年计划的一半，现在这个厂已成为全系统最好的样板厂。抓先进，树样板的领导方法，在过去也是经常运用的，但没有现在这样有计划有系统。过去一般采取两种方法：一是派工作组下去重点培养；二是通过定期评比，以评出的红旗单位为样板，号召大家学习。前者主要是靠外力推动，花力很大，不易巩固，往往工作组走了，样板也垮了；后者主要是靠自然形成，不易完善。这次采用领导和群众相结合、内因和外力相结合而主要依靠内因培养样板的方法，没有花多大力量，仅一个月左右的时间，就在各个行业中培养出二十多个比较成熟的样板厂，这在过去是想不到的。
    目前，这批样板厂正在起着火车头的作用，以他们为前导，推动所有的单位不断革命，力争上游。重工系统在评出苏州机床厂、农业药械厂两个样板厂以后，立即在全系统掀起了学样板，赶样板，超样板的竞赛热潮，每个单位都发动群众立大志，到样板厂去参观学习，对口挂钩，确定学赶的具体目标。苏州轴承厂原是全市最落后的一个单位，现在，在样板厂的推动下，他们提出立志“6月生产翻一番，7月全面超样板”的口号，6月上旬的生产比上月同期增长了二、三倍。同时，两个样板厂则再立大志，不断革命，最近又到处去学先进，补缺门，克服自己的薄弱环节，力争更上一层楼。通过样板厂的火车头作用，大大推动了学、比、赶、帮，竞赛运动的进一步发展，使以技术革命为中心的东学上海，西赶南京的竞赛运动更加具体化。
    运用群众路线的方法培养样板，是领导方法的一大进步，这些样板厂又进一步促进了领导作风的改善。许多样板厂都已成为市区领导机关下厂办公的立足点。领导意图亲自在这些样板厂中具体实践，从中取得经验，样板厂进一步向高标准发展，又促进领导开扩眼界，高瞻远瞩，看到更多的新生事物，看到运动发展的前景。这样，就使领导工作经常站在运动的最前面，正确指导运动的发展。
    群众路线培养样板和由此兴起的“一个样”运动，目前正在全市迅速展开。许多厂矿企业内部也以同样的方法，开展了和样板车间、样板小组、样板个人看齐的“一个样”运动，出现了人人立大志、个个争样板、处处向最先进平衡、向高标准看齐的生产局面。这个运动同任何新生事物一样具有强大的生命力，促成其发展下去，必将大大推动我们工作的前进。以一批样板为前导，带动其他单位赶上它，再出现一批样板厂，其他单位又赶上它，一次一次的赶，一次比一次提高，这样就可以促使更多的单位迅速提高到先进的水平，并且不断地向更高的方向发展。最近，市委总结了这方面的经验，要求广泛地运用这种方法，在全市各个部门、各个厂矿企业中，都开展“一个样”运动。同时，再发展培养单项的样板。充分运用“后来居上”的规律，促进全市以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动阔步迈进。
