According to Xinhua News Agency, the agricultural and pastoral tool reform movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great results. The movement is now continuing vigorously, focusing on the reform of summer weeding tools. Since the beginning of this year, the region's rural and pastoral areas have reformed and promoted more than 300,000 various tools, which is more than the number of tools reformed and promoted in the entire last year. Among them, there are more than 134,000 pieces of cultivating and weeding tools, which can generally increase efficiency by two to six times; more than 70,000 pieces of animal husbandry production tools can save 2.5 million workdays, which is equivalent to an increase of 10,000 laborers.

This year, the planting area of various crops in the autonomous region will increase significantly compared with last year, and the number of large and small livestock delivered and surviving this year has also increased by more than one million head compared with the same period last year. Therefore, the workload of agricultural and pastoral production has greatly increased, and vigorously carrying out tool reform has become one of the important keys to realizing the continuous leap forward in agricultural and pastoral production this year.

Since the spring, Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region have strengthened their specific leadership over the tool reform movement. The Party secretaries of Zhalantun Banner, Horqin Right Wing Front Banner, Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner, and Tumd Banner, and most of the commune Party secretaries, personally went to the fields to hold plows and hoes, and reformed tools together with the commune members. Some banners also stipulated a system for Party members and cadres to take the lead in using reformed tools. Many communes reformed and manufactured a variety of cultivating hoes and weeding machines in light of local conditions, which greatly accelerated the progress of summer weeding. In the Hulunbuir League, Zhaowuda League, and Jerim League, 60% of the summer weeding area has been cultivated. The land that can be hoeed in the Jerim League has basically been hoeed the first time, which is 1.4 million mu more than in the same period last year. In the Yikezhao League, more than 2,000 skilled craftsmen from various communes participated in tool reform, and many commune members took out their idle timber to reform tools. Now, the league has reformed and promoted the use of more than 30,000 various field management tools, which can save 10,000 laborers and 4,000 draught animals. While reforming summer weeding tools, various places have also reformed a large number of water conservancy construction, water lifting, top dressing, pest control, and agricultural product processing tools, which have increased efficiency many times over.

In animal husbandry production, improved tools have also been used extensively in various places. The Evenk Autonomous Banner in Hulunbuir League and the West Ujimqin Banner in Xilin Gol League have achieved semi-mechanization of grass cutting, raking, stacking, stacking, and transporting operations. The four-wheeled grass cutter successfully reformed by the West Ujimqin Banner can cut 210,000 catties of grass in one day and night, increasing efficiency by 10 to 12 times. Tools such as lambing carts, insulated quantitative multi-head feeders, and felt rolling machines created and reformed in various places have greatly increased efficiency.

    内蒙古革新大量农牧工具
    推广夏锄工具十三万件提高工效二到六倍
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区农牧业工具改革运动取得很大成绩，目前运动正以改革夏锄工具为中心继续猛烈展开。今年以来，自治区农村和牧区已经改革和推广了三十多万件各种工具，比去年一年改革和推广的工具还多。其中有十三万四千多件中耕除草工具，一般能提高工效两倍到六倍；七万多件畜牧业生产工具，可以节约二百五十万个工日，等于增加了一万个劳动力。
    今年自治区各种农作物播种面积都将比去年增加很多，今年已经接产成活的大小仔畜也比去年同期增加了一百多万头。因此，农牧业工作量大大增加，大搞工具改革就成为实现今年农牧业生产持续跃进的重要关键之一。
    今春以来，自治区各级党委都加强了对工具改革运动的具体领导。扎赉特旗、科尔沁右翼前旗、科尔沁左翼中旗、土默特旗等地的旗委书记和大部分公社党委书记都亲自下田扶犁、扶锄，同社员一起改革工具，有的旗还规定了党员和干部带头使用改革工具的制度。许多公社因地制宜地改革和制造了多种多样的耘锄和锄草机，使夏锄进度大大加快。呼伦贝尔盟、昭乌达盟、哲里木盟60％的夏锄作业面积实现了耘锄化。哲里木盟能锄的地已经基本锄完头遍，比去年同期多锄了一百四十万亩。伊克昭盟各公社有两千多名能工巧匠参加工具改革，许多社员为了改革工具拿出了自己闲置不用的木料。现在，全盟已改革和推广使用三万多件各种田间管理工具，可以节省一万个劳动力和四千头耕畜。在改革夏锄工具的同时，各地还改革了大量水利施工、提水、追肥、防虫、农产品加工等工具，使工效成倍提高。
    在畜牧业生产上，各地也大量使用了改良工具。呼伦贝尔盟的鄂温克族自治旗和锡林郭勒盟的西乌珠穆沁旗等地，已经实现了打、搂、堆、垛、运草作业的半机械化。西乌珠穆沁旗改革成功的四轮打草机，一昼夜能打草二十一万斤，工效提高十倍到十二倍。各地创造和改革成功的接羔车、保温定量多头哺乳器、擀毡机等工具，都大大提高了工效。
