Xinhua News Agency, Lima, 16th - The Political Committee of the Communist Party of Peru issued a statement regarding the U.S.-instigated meeting of the Organization of American States Council to conspire to interfere in Cuba, calling on the Peruvian people to fight to stop the U.S. plot.

The statement said that neither the Soviet government's warning (to the U.S.) nor the Cuban government's position constitutes any threat to "continental solidarity" and "democratic principles." The Organization of American States is not a trustworthy or appropriate body for defending hemispheric peace and the national sovereignty of Latin American countries.

The statement pointed out that everyone can now see the patriotic and democratic content of the Cuban Revolution. The development of the Cuban Revolution is the real reason for the current conflict between Cuba and the U.S. rulers. The U.S. interventionists have never ceased their aggression against Cuba for a single day: undeniable economic blockade, incidents of U.S. planes based in (U.S.) Florida bombing Cuban sugarcane fields, the explosions of the "La Coubre" freighter and the Havana armory, the refusal of Esso, Shell, and Texaco to refine Cuban government oil, and finally, the reduction of Cuba's sugar quota in the U.S. market. These all prove that the real aggressors are the U.S. imperialists and the U.S. government.

The statement opposes the Peruvian government succumbing to the U.S.'s will in the aforementioned U.S. conspiracy.

The statement concluded by saying that in the face of this threat, all true Peruvians cannot be indifferent. To fight against the U.S. government's conspiracy means not only defending Cuba but also defending our own sovereignty.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th - Public opinion in Colombia and Brazil condemns the U.S. aggressive threat towards Cuba.

Colombia's "Calle" weekly pointed out in an editorial on the 16th that the methods the U.S. is using against Cuba today are the same as those it used in 1954 to arm the subversion of the democratic government of Guatemala: employing the same language, and mobilizing the various reactionary classes in the Americas to defend the interests of this empire.

After listing the Colombian people's support for the Cuban Revolution, the editorial said: "Today, we declare without hesitation that we stand on the side of the Cuban people, and we call on democrats of all parties in Colombia to resolutely and enthusiastically participate in this American movement to support Cuba." The editorial emphasized that the Colombian working class will give the Cuban Revolution the most effective support: refusing to produce and transport to the United States the sugar that needs to be imported from other countries due to the reduction of Cuba's sugar import quota.

Raimundo Reis, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Salvador, the capital of Bahia, Brazil, called on the people and politicians of the state to support Cuba's right to control its own destiny. Reis spoke of the suffering of the Cuban people, saying that they are threatened by U.S. intervention every day.

A recent issue of the "New Orientation" weekly said that Brazilian public opinion strongly demands that the Brazilian government make a clear decision to oppose the U.S. conspiracy and defend the Cuban people's right to self-determination. After pointing out that Latin America is no longer the backyard of the United States, the newspaper said, "Cuba's cause is our cause, and we should defend Cuba against the threat from the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, 16th - "Democratic Voice" published an article by Gilberto Vieira, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Colombia, on the 15th, condemning U.S. imperialism's plunder of Colombia.

Gilberto Vieira's article said, "One hundred and fifty years after declaring independence, our country has once again become a dependency and taxpayer of a powerful foreign country. The fact that we Colombians are not the masters of our natural wealth is enough to illustrate this point. Oil, gold, and platinum are basically controlled by U.S. monopoly capital groups, and the country's foreign trade is manipulated by Americans." The article pointed out that the International Monetary Fund, which belongs to the U.S. financial groups, dared to veto the legitimate trade agreement of the Colombian Coffee Federation and even oppose the laws of the Republic's Congress. The article also pointed out that a U.S. military mission continues to operate in the Colombian army, while a U.S. espionage mission shamelessly operates in Colombia under the pretext of investigating communist activities in Colombia.

Analyzing the forces that are emerging, the article wrote, "The bugle call for Latin America's second struggle for independence has already sounded. In the land of Cuba, the revolution is advancing and deepening. At the same time, throughout Latin America, various forces for liberation are gathering, and the contradictions between our people and U.S. imperialist oppression are intensifying."

　　秘鲁共产党政治委员会发表声明
　　号召制止美国干涉古巴的罪行
　　哥伦比亚和巴西舆论支持古巴人民保卫独立的斗争
    新华社利马16日电　秘鲁共产党政治委员会就美国策动召开美洲国家组织理事会会议阴谋干涉古巴一事发表声明，号召秘鲁人民为制止美国的阴谋而斗争。
    声明说，无论是苏联政府（对美国）的警告或是古巴政府的立场，都不构成对“大陆团结”和“民主原则”的任何威胁。美洲国家组织不是得到信任的保卫半球和平和拉丁美洲各国民族主权的适当的机构。
    声明指出，现在任何人都看到了古巴革命的爱国主义和民主的内容。古巴革命的发展是目前在古巴和美国执政者之间发生冲突的真正原因。美国干涉者一天也没有停止过对古巴的侵略：无法掩饰的经济封锁，以（美国）佛罗里达为基地的美国飞机轰炸古巴甘蔗地的事件，“勒库布尔”号轮船和哈瓦那军火库的爆炸，美孚油公司、壳牌石油公司和德士古石油公司拒绝提炼古巴政府的石油，最后是削减古巴在美国市场的食糖份额。这些都证明，真正的侵略者是美帝国主义者和美国政府。
    声明反对秘鲁政府在美国的上述阴谋中屈从于美国的意旨。
    声明最后说，面对这个威胁，一切真正的秘鲁人都不能麻木不仁。为反对美国政府的阴谋而斗争不仅意味着保卫古巴，而且是保卫我们自己的主权。
    新华社17日讯　哥伦比亚、巴西舆论谴责美国对古巴的侵略威胁。
    哥伦比亚“街道”周报16日在一篇社论中指出，美国今天用来反对古巴的手法，正如它在1954年用来武装颠覆危地马拉民主政府所用的手法一样：运用了同样的语言，同样地在动员美洲的各个反动阶层来保卫这个帝国的利益。
    社论列举了哥伦比亚人民对古巴革命的支持以后说：“今天，我们毫不动摇地宣布，我们站在古巴人民的一边，我们号召哥伦比亚一切政党的民主人士坚决热烈地参加这次美洲的支援古巴运动。”社论强调指出，哥伦比亚的工人阶级将给古巴革命以最有效的支持：拒绝生产和向美国运输由于削减了古巴食糖的进口份额需要从其它国家进口的食糖。
    巴西巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多市立法议会议员赖孟多·雷斯号召该州的人民和政界人士支持古巴自己掌握自己命运的权利。雷斯谈到古巴人民的痛苦时说，古巴人民每天都受到美国干涉的威胁。
    最近的一期“新方针”周刊说，巴西公众舆论强烈要求巴西政府明确决定反对美国的阴谋，并且保卫古巴人民的自决权。这家报纸在指出拉丁美洲已经不再是美国的后院之后说，“古巴的事业就是我们的事业，我们应该保卫古巴反对美国的威胁。”
    新华社波哥大16日电　“民主呼声报”15日刊载了哥伦比亚共产党总书记希尔伯托·维埃拉的一篇文章，谴责美帝国主义对哥伦比亚的掠夺。
    希尔伯托·维埃拉的文章说，“在宣布独立一百五十年后，我国现在又重新成为一个强大的外国的附庸和纳税人，我们哥伦比亚人不是我国自然财富的主人这种情况就足以说明这一点。石油、黄金、白金基本上控制在美国垄断资本集团的手中，国家的对外贸易操纵在美国人手里”。文章指出，属于美国财团的国际货币基金组织竟然胆敢否决哥伦比亚咖啡联合会的正当的贸易协定，甚至反对共和国议会的法律。文章同时指出，一个美国军事使团继续在哥伦比亚军队中进行活动，同时还有一个美国间谍使团无耻地在哥伦比亚活动，它的借口是调查在哥伦比亚的共产主义活动。
    文章在分析当前正在涌现出的力量时写道，“拉丁美洲第二次争取独立的号角已经响起来了，在古巴这块土地上，革命正在推进和深入发展，同时，在整个拉丁美洲，争取解放的各种力量正在聚积起来，我们各国人民同美帝国主义压迫之间的矛盾正在尖锐化。”
