Mass Production of Chlorella

The successful cultivation of chlorella and its large-scale use in animal husbandry, especially in pig farming, is a great creation of the Chinese people during the Great Leap Forward. Now is the best season for breeding chlorella, and all regions should act quickly to breed and produce chlorella in large quantities.

Chlorella is a single-celled aquatic plant, very small in size. Ten thousand individual cells lined up are only about three inches long. In the past, it grew naturally in ponds, marshes, and ditches, forming green foam on the water surface. People considered it sewage and waste. Now, after cultivation and testing, it has been proven not to be waste but a treasure. One hundred catties of dry chlorella powder contains forty-five catties of protein, which is five and a half times higher than the protein content of rice and more than three times higher than that of wheat. It contains about fifteen catties of fat, which is more than ten times that of rice and more than six times that of wheat. In addition, it also contains a large amount of carbohydrates and various vitamins. According to comparative experiments, pigs that regularly eat chlorella gain weight about twice as fast as pigs that do not eat chlorella. Chlorella contains important medicinal materials and antibiotics, has the effect of inducing labor and preventing and controlling epidemics, can help sows conceive and produce more piglets, help dairy cows increase milk production, and help sick animals recover their health. After the successful cultivation of chlorella and its large-scale utilization, various places have successively discovered and utilized large-celled chlorella, Neurospora crassa, and aureomycin bacteria as feed, all of which have high nutritional value. These facts fully demonstrate that natural resources are inexhaustible, and many "treasures" are still dormant. As long as people liberate their minds, are willing to study, and dare to explore, they can continue to uncover the mysteries of nature, fully tap the potential of natural resources, and make them serve the diverse needs of the people.

Chlorella grows quickly and has a high yield. According to experiments by the Wenzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute in Zhejiang, under normal circumstances, chlorella can be harvested twenty to thirty times a year. One mu of water surface can produce 600,000 to 800,000 catties of chlorella concentrate annually, making about 10,000 catties of dry powder. Calculating on the basis of an average of three catties of chlorella concentrate per pig per day, the chlorella produced on one mu of water surface can feed 600 to 800 pigs. The harvest from one mu of water surface is something that no high-yield crop can match.

Chlorella is not only a good concentrated feed, but also has high edible value. It contains more than 20 kinds of amino acids, the total amount of which accounts for about 42% of the protein it contains. This is an essential element to meet human needs. Some places have used chlorella to trial-produce pastries, bread, sweets, dishes, algae porridge, algae sauce and other foods, which are of high quality, delicious, fragrant and palatable. Some people have tried to use chlorella powder to feed infants, and the effect is comparable to milk powder. The discovery and utilization of chlorella is indeed a great leap in agricultural productivity.

People need land, labor, tools and machines to grow crops. To breed chlorella, only nutrient solution, air and light energy are needed. It will not compete with various crops for land or labor, and will not affect the development of grain and industrial raw material production. Therefore, it has superior conditions for factory production. With appropriate control, it can break away from the influence of natural conditions and continuously produce year-round. We can also actively control its nutrition, temperature, light and other conditions to speed up its growth and allow it to produce various nutrients according to our needs. Chlorella production has a great future.

Although the successful cultivation of chlorella is neither a major invention nor cutting-edge technology, it is indeed a matter of great significance. Although chlorella is small, using chlorella is not a trivial matter. The size and importance of a thing is mainly determined not by the level of technology and the ease of invention, but by its contribution to mankind and its role in socialist construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, many "ordinary little things" have appeared in our country, promoting the leap forward in the country's socialist construction. For example, adding a ball bearing to a wheel is a small thing, but as a result of its implementation, work efficiency immediately increases by several to more than ten times. Can we say this is a small thing? Chlorella has great economic value, as already mentioned; its successful cultivation also marks a major leap in agricultural science – breaking through the circle of planting various crops on land, further exploring the mysteries of nature, and extracting more wealth from nature. In this sense, this is a great liberation of our thinking.

The needs of the development of productive forces promote the continuous progress of scientific research, and the achievements of scientific research in turn promote the faster development of productive forces. Since the Great Leap Forward, the great development of animal husbandry has required people to quickly solve the problem of feed sources, especially to find concentrated feeds that grow fast and have high yields. The Wenzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute in Zhejiang, which first bred and used chlorella to feed pigs, started this research work in the spring of last year under such circumstances. The staff of the experimental group, including technicians, originally knew nothing about how to cultivate chlorella, but under the shining of the general line, with the support and encouragement of the Party organization, and inspired by the lofty idea of developing animal husbandry more, faster, better, and more economically, they liberated their minds, boosted their energy, and conducted in-depth and detailed research and exploration of chlorella. After twenty or thirty repeated experiments, they finally mastered the technology from small-scale cultivation to large-scale reproduction, enabling the research work of chlorella to quickly enter a new stage: from indoor to outdoor, from cultivation in glass bottles to large-scale open-air production. Over the past year or so, in the process of learning and promoting this experience, various places have implemented the policy of using both indigenous and foreign methods, making the cultivation of chlorella quickly spread to most provinces and regions, and formed a broad mass movement in many counties and communes, achieving remarkable results. The area for breeding chlorella in Zhejiang Province has reached more than 2,100 mu. In many counties and cities, a mass movement of breeding chlorella has emerged with everyone doing it, every commune, every team, and every farm. In Ruian County, more than 1,000 production teams and about 3,000 livestock farms are breeding chlorella, producing more than 15 million catties of chlorella concentrate in the past three months. Linru County in Henan Province learned from the experience of Wenzhou. In just one month, the cultivation of chlorella has spread throughout the county. By the end of May, more than 180,000 catties of chlorella liquid had been produced. The more than 800 pig farms in the suburbs of Beijing have also recently been breeding chlorella in large quantities. The successful cultivation of chlorella and its rapid promotion fully demonstrate that scientific research must be combined with mass movements. The research on chlorella originally had a history of many years, but in the past, it mostly remained in scientific research institutions or medical and health departments, and did not meet the broad masses, so there were no significant results. This time, the direction of research and promotion of chlorella is correct, and a nationwide movement has quickly formed, and the great role of chlorella has begun to play out.

Chlorella has begun to show its great power. We should strengthen the leadership of chlorella production, strengthen the exchange of experience and technical guidance, and promote the already formed mass movement of chlorella production to develop more vigorously.

    大量生产小球藻
    小球藻培育成功，并且大量用于以养猪为中心的畜牧业，这是我国人民在大跃进中的一项伟大的创造。目前正是繁殖小球藻的最好季节，各地应该迅速行动起来，大量繁殖、生产小球藻。
    小球藻是单细胞水生植物，体积很小，一万个单体排起来，也只有三寸左右长。过去，它自然生长在池沼河渠中，在水面上泛起绿色泡沫，人们认为这是污水，是废物。现在，经过培养化验，证明它不是废物，而是宝物，一百斤小球藻干粉中，含有四十五斤蛋白质，比大米的蛋白质含量高五倍半，比小麦高三倍多；含有脂肪约十五斤，比大米多十几倍，比小麦多六倍以上。此外，它还含有大量碳水化合物和各种维生素。根据对比试验证明，经常吃小球藻的猪，体重增加的速度约比不吃小球藻的猪快一倍左右。小球藻含有重要的药料和抗生素，有催生和防治疫病的作用，能帮助母猪受孕并多生仔猪，帮助乳牛增加产奶量，帮助病畜恢复健康。在小球藻培育成功并开始大量利用以后，各地陆续发现了和利用了大球藻、链孢霉菌和金霉素菌等作饲料，也都具有很高的营养价值。这些事实充分说明了：自然资源是用之不竭的，许多“宝物”还在沉睡之中，只要人们解放了思想，肯钻研，敢探索，就能不断揭开大自然的奥秘，充分挖掘自然资源的潜力，使它为人们多种多样的需要服务。
    小球藻生长很快，产量很高。据浙江温州专区农业科学研究所试验，在一般情况下繁殖小球藻，一年收获二、三十次；一亩水面每年能生产小球藻浓缩液六十万到八十万斤，制成干粉一万斤左右；以每头猪每天平均喂三斤小球藻浓缩液计算，一亩水面生产的小球藻能喂六百头到八百头猪。一亩水面能收获这样多的东西，是任何高产作物赶不上的。
    小球藻不仅是很好的精饲料，它还具有很高的食用价值。它含有二十多种氨基酸，总量约占所含蛋白质的42％左右，这是满足人体需要必不可少的重要原素。有些地方用小球藻试制糕点、面包、糖果、菜肴、藻粥、藻酱等食品，质高味美，清香可口；有人试用小球藻粉哺育婴儿，效果跟奶粉不相上下。小球藻的发现和利用，实在是农业生产力的一大飞跃。
    人们种庄稼，离不开土地、劳力、工具和机器。而繁殖小球藻，只要有营养液、空气和光能就行了。它不会跟各种庄稼争地、争劳力，不会影响粮食和工业原料生产的发展。因此，它具备优越的工厂化生产条件，只要加以适当的控制，就可以摆脱自然条件的影响，使其长年不断地连续生产。我们还可能主动控制它的营养、温度、光线等条件，加快它的成长速度，让它按照我们的需要生产各种养分。小球藻的生产具有远大的前途。
    小球藻培育成功虽然既非重大发明，也非尖端技术，但确实是一件具有重大意义的事情。小球藻虽小，利用小球藻却不是小事，一件事情的大小重轻，主要不决定于技术的高低和发明的难易，而决定于它对人类的贡献，对社会主义建设的作用。大跃进以来，我们国家出现了许许多多“平常的小事情”，推动国家的社会主义建设事业飞跃前进。比如，在车轮上加个滚珠轴承，该是一件小事情了，但推行结果，工效立即提高几倍至十几倍，能说这是小事情么？小球藻具有极大的经济价值，前面已经说过了；它的培育成功，还标志着农业科学的一大飞跃——冲破在土地上种植各种农作物的圈子，进一步探索自然的奥秘，向大自然索取更多的财富。从这个意义上说，这是我们的思想的一大解放。
    发展生产力的需要推动科学研究不断前进，科学研究成果反转来推动生产力更快地发展。大跃进以来，畜牧业的大发展要求人们迅速解决饲料来源问题，特别要求人们找到生长快、产量高的精饲料。首先繁殖并利用小球藻喂猪的浙江温州专区农业科学研究所，就是在这种情况下于去年春天开始这项研究工作的。试验小组的工作人员，包括技师在内，本来对如何培养小球藻一点都不知道，但是，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党组织的支持和鼓励下，在多、快、好、省地发展畜牧业的崇高思想鼓舞下，他们解放思想、鼓起干劲，对小球藻进行了深入、细致的研究和探索，经过二、三十次的反复试验，终于掌握了从小量培养到大面积繁殖的技术，使小球藻的研究工作迅速进入一个新的阶段：从室内转到室外，从玻璃瓶中的培养转到大规模露天生产。一年多来，各地在学习推广这一经验的过程中，贯彻执行能洋就洋、能土就土、土洋并举的两条腿走路的方针，使小球藻的培育工作很快地遍及大部省区，并在不少县、社形成了广泛的群众性运动，取得了显著的成绩。浙江全省繁殖小球藻的面积已达二千一百多亩，不少县、市出现了人人户户动手，社社、队队、场场繁殖小球藻的群众运动。瑞安县有一千多个生产队、约三千个畜牧场繁殖小球藻，最近三个月生产一千五百多万斤小球藻浓缩液。河南临汝县学习温州的经验，在短短的一个月中，小球藻的培育工作已遍及全县，到5月下旬，已经生产了十八万多斤小球藻液。北京市郊各公社八百多个猪场，最近也大量繁殖小球藻。小球藻培育成功和速迅推广，充分说明了科学研究工作必须与群众运动相结合。对小球藻的研究，本来已有多年的历史，但过去大都停留在科学研究机关或医药卫生部门，没有跟广大群众见面，所以没有什么显著的结果。这次，对小球藻的研究、推广方向对头了，迅速形成遍及全国的运动，小球藻的大作用就开始发挥出来了。
    小球藻已经开始大显威力，我们应该加强对小球藻生产的领导，加强经验交流和技术指导，促使已经形成的生产小球藻的群众运动，更加蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
