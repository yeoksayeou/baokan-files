    Xinhua News Agency reports: In order to intensify the tense situation in Asia, the United States has recently stepped up its military activities in Asia.
    It is reported that the U.S. Air Force dispatched C-133 "Globemaster" aircraft capable of carrying various missiles to Southeast Asia on the 20th. The aircraft, which has four turboprop engines, will conduct test flights via the Philippines, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other places.
    In addition, the United States has decided to send more missile-carrying cruisers to the Pacific. It is reported that U.S. Navy officers held a press conference on the heavy cruiser "Canberra," equipped with surface-to-air missiles, on the 15th, saying that other U.S. cruisers equipped with missiles will soon be deployed in the Pacific with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Some of these warships may eventually be stationed in Japan.
    According to an announcement by Captain Bomberger of the cruiser "Canberra," the cruiser "Providence" has been added to the Pacific to conduct aggression activities together with the "Canberra." These warships will participate in various units stationed in the Pacific, including the Seventh Fleet "patrolling" the Taiwan Strait.
    Xinhua News Agency: A recent issue of the Japanese weekly "Kōron" revealed the conspiracy of the U.S. military stationed in Japan to prepare for chemical and bacteriological warfare.
    The magazine reported that the United States has established a school at the Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi Prefecture that specializes in training for so-called CBR warfare. CBR is an abbreviation for "chemical, bacteriological, and radiological."
    "Kōron" revealed that chemical and bacteriological weapons are currently being produced on a large scale at the Biological Warfare Research Institute in the suburbs of Washington, the headquarters of the Chemical Task Force in Maryland, and the arsenal near Denver.
    "Kōron" also revealed that the Japanese army's work on researching chemical, bacteriological, and radiological warfare is being carried out under the guidance of the CBR training school at the Iwakuni base.
    "Kōron" said that the Japanese "Ground Self-Defense Force" has established a chemical warfare school in Omiya City, a suburb of Tokyo. This school uses American textbooks.
    Xinhua News Agency: The "Manila Times" reported that Philippine Air Force Commander Brigadier General Molina revealed on the 13th that the equipment of U.S. "Sidewinder" missiles has begun to be shipped from the United States to the Philippines.
    The news said that two squadrons of F-86 Sabre jet fighters of the Philippine Air Force will be equipped with "Sidewinder" missiles.
    This is considered a further step by the United States to place the Philippines in its strategic system for conducting aggressive wars in the Far East.
    The news revealed that the Philippine Air Force also hopes to obtain an F-86-D type interceptor fighter squadron from the United States in this fiscal year.
    Molina also stated that the Philippine Air Force will build special shelters to store "Sidewinder" missiles.
    Xinhua News Agency: Bangkok's "Siam Rath" reported on the 8th that Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Thanom Kittikachorn revealed to the Bangkok press on the 7th that the United States will greatly increase its military "aid" to Thailand this year, and that since 1958 alone, the total value of military "aid" provided by the United States to Thailand has exceeded US$100 million. The U.S. government has also indicated to Thailand that it will increase its military "aid" year by year in the future.
    U.S. imperialism is currently stepping up its plans to equip the Thai army with modern weapons, including various rocket weapons, to cooperate with its war preparations around the world. As reported by Bangkok newspapers earlier, the United States has jointly formulated a five-year military "aid" plan for Thailand with Thailand.
    The United States has been urging Thailand to build strategic highways through "aid" and loans to strengthen its aggressive deployment in Southeast Asia.
    According to Nai Satien, director of the Thai Department of Highways, in a statement to the press on the 13th, the Thai authorities have decided to build three new strategic highways. One of these strategic highways runs from Mukdahan Province through Sakon Nakhon Province directly to the Lao border; one runs from Tak Province through Sukhothai Province, Phitsanulok Province to Khon Kaen Province; and the other runs from Wan Noi County in Khon Kaen Province through Maha Sarakham Province, Ubon Ratchathani Province to the Lao border.
    Nai Satien also revealed that in addition to building these strategic highways, the Thai authorities will also expand several existing highways connecting neighboring countries and regions.

    美国加紧在亚洲的备战活动
    派出载运导弹的飞机军舰到亚洲活动利用在日军事基地准备化学战细菌战用“响尾蛇式”导弹装备菲律宾空军策划对泰国军队进行现代化武器装备
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国为了在亚洲加剧紧张局势，最近加强了在亚洲的军事活动。
    据报道，美国空军20日派出能载运多种导弹的C—133式“霸王式”飞机到东南亚活动。这架有四个涡轮推进引擎的飞机将经菲律宾、泰国、印度、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯等地进行试飞。
    此外，美国还决定向太平洋增派带有导弹的巡洋舰。据报道，美国海军军官15日在装备有地对空导弹的重型巡洋舰“坎培拉号”上举行的一次记者招待会上说，另外一些装有导弹的美国巡洋舰不久将同美国第七舰队一起部署在太平洋。其中有些军舰最后可能驻在日本。
    据“坎培拉号”巡洋舰舰长邦柏格宣布，巡洋舰“普罗维顿斯号”已经被增派到太平洋同“坎培拉号”一起进行侵略活动。这些军舰将参加到驻太平洋的各个不同部队里去，包括在台湾海峡“巡逻”的第七舰队在内。
    据新华社讯　最近一期日本“公论”周刊揭露了驻日美军准备进行化学战和细菌战的阴谋。
    杂志报道，美国在山口县岩国基地建立了专门训练进行所谓CBR战争的学校。CBR是“化学、细菌和放射性”这几个字的缩写。
    “公论”透露，化学武器和细菌武器目前正在华盛顿郊外的生物战争研究所、马里兰州化学特遣部队总部和丹佛城附近的兵工厂中大规模生产。
    “公论”还透露，日本军队研究化学、细菌和放射性战争的工作是在岩国基地CBR训练学校指导下进行的。
    “公论”说，日本“陆上自卫队”在东京郊外大宫市设立了化学战争学校。这个学校使用的是美国教科书。
    据新华社讯　“马尼拉时报”报道，菲律宾空军司令摩林纳准将13日透露，美国的“响尾蛇式”导弹的装备已经开始从美国运到菲律宾。
    消息说，菲律宾空军的两个F—86佩刀式喷气机中队将装备“响尾蛇”式导弹。
    这被认为是美国进一步把菲律宾置于它在远东进行侵略战争的战略体系的一个步骤。
    消息透露说，菲律宾空军还希望在这个财政年度里从美国得到一个F—86—D型狙击战斗机中队。
    摩林纳还表示，菲律宾空军将建造专门的防舍来存放“响尾蛇”式导弹。
    据新华社讯　曼谷“暹民报”8日报道，泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬·吉滴卡宗7日向曼谷报界透露：美国将在今年大大增加对泰国的军事“援助”，而仅在1958年以来，美国给予泰国的军事“援助”总值已超过一亿美元。美国政府还向泰国表示将在以后逐年增加对泰国的军事“援助”。
    美帝国主义最近正加紧策划用包括各种火箭武器在内的现代化武器装备泰国军队，以配合它在世界各地进行的备战活动。据曼谷报纸早些时候报道，美国已经同泰国联合拟定了一项对泰国的五年军事“援助”计划。
    美国一直用“援助”和贷款的方式督促泰国修筑战略公路，以加强它在东南亚的侵略部署。
    据泰国路政厅长乃沙天13日向报界发表谈话时透露，泰国当局已决定修建三条新的战略公路。这些战略公路中一条是由莫肯府经色军府直达老挝边境；一条由哒府经素可泰府、彭世洛府到坤敬府；另一条由坤敬府的万沛县经吗哈沙拉堪府、乌汶府到老挝边境。
    乃沙天还透露，泰国当局除了修建这些战略公路外，还将扩建原有的几条连贯邻近国家和地区的公路。
