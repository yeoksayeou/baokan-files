Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Returned overseas Chinese from various places continue to protest the atrocities of the West Java army, instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia, in shooting and killing overseas Chinese women.

    Overseas Chinese women in Guangzhou are particularly angered by the atrocities of the West Java army. While lodging a strong protest, they have also exposed the crimes of powerful groups in Indonesia who, betraying the Indonesian government's promise of no more forced relocation, are intensifying the persecution of overseas Chinese. Lin Lan, an overseas Chinese woman who returned from Indonesia in April, lost all her property in the Bangka fire. She angrily accused that the Bangka fire occurred inexplicably, and the fire spread so rapidly that when she woke up from her dream, the roof was already on fire. She and several children almost died in the fire, and there was no time to salvage any of their property. She said: My children and I have now returned to the warm embrace of the motherland, but I cannot forget my fellow overseas Chinese sisters in Indonesia. The cries of Yang Mu-mei and Ye Jin-niang's orphans calling "Mommy" seem to echo in my ears. I protest the atrocities of the West Java army instigated and supported by powerful groups in Indonesia.

    In Shanghai, Guo Bilun, an old teacher who had taught in overseas Chinese schools in Indonesia for more than 30 years, said at a rally with indignation: When Indonesia was subjected to imperialist aggression, overseas Chinese, like the Indonesian people, suffered the killing and enslavement of imperialism and fought against the invaders together. Now that Indonesia is independent, it should protect the legitimate interests of the nationals of friendly neighboring countries. However, powerful groups in Indonesia are engaging in large-scale anti-Chinese activities, even resorting to creating bloody incidents, which is truly infuriating. Fang Zhizhan, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who works in medical services, refuted the lies of Nawawi, the press officer of the West Java Military District Command, that the deaths of overseas Chinese women were due to "accidental firing of rifles" and "not intentional shooting." He questioned: If it was an accidental firing of a rifle, why did Ye Jinniang suffer seven shots, six of which hit vital areas such as the breasts, navel, and abdomen? He pointed out that no matter what, the crime of deliberately creating the massacre of overseas Chinese women cannot be denied.

    The Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese sent a telegram this afternoon to Lin Dunhua and Lin Yu, the husbands of the victims of the Chima圩 massacre, expressing deep condolences. The telegram stated that the bloody massacre caused by the West Java army in Chima圩 on July 3 shows that powerful groups in Indonesia are intensifying the persecution of overseas Chinese and further undermining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. In order to safeguard the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Indonesia, and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, we resolutely demand that the Indonesian government severely punish the murderers, compensate the families of the murdered overseas Chinese, immediately release the arrested overseas Chinese, guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and publicly apologize. It must also cease all anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities, fulfill its promise to stop forced relocation, and be responsible for repatriating overseas Chinese who have been displaced and unable to make a living due to forced relocation.

    Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and representatives of overseas Chinese students in Hangzhou held a meeting today. Wen Manhun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the meeting that powerful groups in Indonesia are intensifying the persecution of overseas Chinese and deliberately creating bloody tragedies of killing overseas Chinese, with the aim of undermining the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Indonesia. All returned overseas Chinese in Hangzhou express great indignation at this.

    At a meeting held on the afternoon of July 6 by returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Jinan, Wang Jiechen, who lived in Indonesia for more than 10 years and is the Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: The people of Shandong Province and returned overseas Chinese express great anger at the crime of the West Java army shooting and killing innocent overseas Chinese. We lodge a strong protest with the Indonesian government and express our sincere condolences to the families of the deceased overseas Chinese. Xie Tianrui, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and the Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the evil means adopted by powerful groups in Indonesia against overseas Chinese will never achieve their sinister purposes.

    各地归侨对西爪哇军队暴行义愤填膺
    坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手
    据新华社7日讯　各地归国华侨继续抗议印度尼西亚有势力集团指使西爪哇军队枪杀华侨妇女的暴行。
    广州市的归侨妇女对西爪哇军队的暴行特别愤怒，她们在提出严重抗议的同时，并纷纷揭露印度尼西亚有势力集团背弃印度尼西亚政府不再迫迁的诺言，加紧迫害华侨的罪行。4月间从印度尼西亚回国的华侨妇女林兰，在邦戛大火中丧失了全部财产。她愤怒地控诉说，邦戛大火是莫名其妙地发生的，火势来得又是那么猛烈，她在梦中醒来时，大火已经燃着了房顶，她和几个孩子几乎葬身火窟，全部财产也来不及抢救。她说：我和孩子们现在已回到了祖国温暖的怀抱，但我忘不了在印度尼西亚的侨胞姐妹。杨木妹和叶金娘的孤儿哀叫“妈妈”的声音好像响在我的耳边，我抗议印度尼西亚有势力集团策动和支持下的西爪哇军队的暴行。
    在上海，曾经在印度尼西亚华侨学校教书三十多年的老教员郭弼伦在集会上激愤地说：当印度尼西亚遭受帝国主义侵略的时候，华侨也和印度尼西亚人民一样同受帝国主义残杀和奴役，并且也一同向侵略者作斗争。今天印度尼西亚已经独立了，就应该保护友邻国家侨民的正当利益。但是印度尼西亚有势力集团却大肆排华，甚至不惜制造流血事件，真是令人愤慨。从事医务工作的印度尼西亚归侨方志展，驳斥了西爪哇军区司令部新闻官纳瓦维所谓华侨妇女被杀害是由于“步枪走火”、而“不是有意开枪”的谎言。他质问道：如果是步枪走火，为什么叶金娘身中七枪有六枪都打在乳房、脐部、腹部等要害部位？他指出，蓄意制造惨杀华侨妇女的罪责，不管怎样也是抵赖不了的。
    福建省归国华侨联合会今天下午打电报给芝马圩惨案受难者的丈夫林敦华和林玉，致以深切的慰问。电文中说，西爪哇军队7月3日在芝马圩所造成的血腥惨案，说明印度尼西亚有势力集团正在变本加厉地迫害华侨，进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系。为了维护中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好关系，为了保障华侨生命财产的安全，我们坚决要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手，抚恤被害华侨家属，立即释放被捕华侨，保证今后不再发生类似事件和公开道歉，并停止一切反华排华活动，实现停止迫迁的诺言，负责遣送因受迫迁而流离失所无法谋生的华侨回国。
    杭州市归国华侨、侨眷和华侨学生代表在今天举行了集会。杭州市归国华侨联合会筹备委员会主任文曼魂在会上说，印度尼西亚有势力集团变本加厉地迫害华侨，蓄意制造杀害华侨的流血惨剧，目的在于破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民间的友好关系，杭州市全体归侨对此表示极大的愤慨。
    在济南市归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生6日下午举行的集会上，曾经在印度尼西亚居住十多年的归侨、山东省归国华侨联合会筹备委员会主任王捷臣说：山东省人民和归国华侨，对西爪哇军队枪杀无辜华侨的罪行表示极大的愤怒。我们向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈抗议，并对死难的华侨家属表示亲切的慰问。印度尼西亚归侨、山东省归国华侨联合会筹备委员会副主任谢天瑞说，印度尼西亚有势力集团对华侨所采取的罪恶手段，绝不会达到他们罪恶的目的。
