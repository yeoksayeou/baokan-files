Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 6th. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 6th regarding the conclusion of the visit of the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Leshi, to brotherly Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia. The editorial stated that these visits helped to strengthen the friendly relations between Albania and the brotherly Asian countries, and helped to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The editorial introduced in detail the achievements of China's industry and agriculture with specific figures. The editorial said that the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction were obtained under the wise and far-sighted leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. These achievements have shortened the time for socialism to economically defeat capitalism. The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the entire socialist camp.

The editorial said that the development of events in recent years has shown that People's China has become a strong fortress of socialism and peace, and it has won great prestige internationally. Without the participation of great People's China, no major international issues can be thoroughly resolved. However, US imperialism frantically opposes China, hindering the representatives of the great 650 million Chinese people from enjoying their legitimate status in the United Nations. The US imperialist policy of aggression against People's China is also manifested in the occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and constant provocations against China. US imperialism has exposed itself to the world as the most insane enemy of peace, progress, and national independence. The Albanian people and their government have resolutely condemned these imperialist crimes in the past and present, and will always support People's China's peaceful foreign policy, support it in occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and support it in liberating Taiwan.

The editorial then introduced the achievements of socialist construction in Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia. The editorial said that the brilliant victories of the brotherly people of Asian socialist countries were achieved through their own great creative labor and under the correct leadership of their Marxist-Leninist parties, and embody the vital friendship and common internationalist assistance of our greatest ally, the Soviet Union. These victories are valuable contributions to strengthening our camp, and a heavy blow to the imperialist bloc and its lackeys. The editorial also introduced the struggles of the Vietnamese and Korean people to unify their motherland and condemned the conspiracy of the US imperialist group to antagonize the Mongolian People's Republic. The editorial pointed out that the Albanian people, through their representatives, once again expressed their full support during their friendly visits to Vietnam and Korea for the efforts made by the governments of these two countries to achieve the great goal of unifying their motherlands.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸评列希访问亚洲兄弟国家
    盛赞中朝越蒙建设成就巨大
    新华社地拉那6日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”6日就阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希结束对中国、越南、朝鲜和蒙古等亚洲兄弟国家的访问发表社论说，这些访问有助于加强阿尔巴尼亚同亚洲兄弟国家的友好关系，有助于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。社论以具体的数字详细地介绍了中国工农业方面的成就。社论说，中国人民在社会主义建设中的伟大成就是在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明和有远见的领导下取得的。这些成就缩短了社会主义在经济上战胜资本主义的时间。中国人民的胜利也是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。
    社论说，近几年来，事态的发展表明，人民中国已成为社会主义和和平的强大堡垒，它在国际上已赢得了巨大的威信。没有伟大的人民中国的参加，任何重大的国际问题都是不可能得到彻底解决的。但是，美帝国主义疯狂地敌视中国，阻挠伟大的六亿五千万中国人民的代表在联合国享有自己的合法地位。美帝国主义对人民中国的侵略政策还表现在对中国领土台湾的侵占，对中国的不断挑衅。美帝国主义向全世界暴露了自己是和平、进步和各民族独立的最疯狂的敌人。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其政府过去和现在都坚决谴责帝国主义的这些侵略罪行，并将永远支持人民中国的和平外交政策，支持它在联合国占有自己的合法席位，支持它解放台湾。
    社论接着介绍了越南、朝鲜和蒙古社会主义建设的成就。社论说，亚洲社会主义国家兄弟人民的辉煌胜利，是以自己伟大的创造性劳动和在他们的马克思列宁主义政党的正确领导下取得的，并体现着我们最伟大的友邦苏联的富有生命力的友谊和共同的国际主义援助。这些胜利对加强我们的阵营是十分宝贵的贡献，而对于帝国主义集团及其仆从则是一个沉重的打击。社论还介绍了越、朝人民统一祖国的斗争和谴责美帝集团敌视蒙古人民共和国的阴谋。社论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民通过他们的代表，在友好访问越、朝期间再一次地表达了完全支持这两个国家的政府为实现统一祖国这一伟大目标而作出的努力。
