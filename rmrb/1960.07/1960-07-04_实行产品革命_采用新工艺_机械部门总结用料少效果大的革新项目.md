    Implement Product Revolution, Adopt New Technology
    Mechanical Departments Summarize Innovation Projects with Less Material and Greater Effect
    (Our dispatch) The mechanical industry system is vigorously promoting 196 major innovation projects across the country. These projects are the results of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the vast majority of which are easy to implement, save materials, cost less, save manpower, and have great effects, and are of great significance for improving the technical level of China's mechanical industry and promoting the leap forward development of various sectors of the national economy.
    Among the 141 new types of products independently created by China and improved old products that are being promoted, there are new types of water pumps, welded structure water turbines, simple machine tools, oil-containing bearings, electro-pulse machining machine tools, improved Liberation brand automobiles, micro-cars, etc. Among them, more than 20 products such as new water pumps have been included in the national plan and put into batch production throughout the country, while the rest are actively carrying out various preparations.
    The 55 major new technologies vigorously promoted by the mechanical industry include "chipless machining," "sand-free casting," "high-efficiency cutting tools," "combined machine tool processing methods," "combined fixtures," "combined molds," and "composite technology," etc. More than half of these new technology projects have been widely used nationwide or in some regions. The application of these new technologies in various regions shows that these new technologies have achieved great results in saving materials, improving labor productivity, improving working conditions, and improving product quality.
    In order to promote the rapid blossoming and fruit bearing of these advanced projects across the country, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the local machinery departments and bureaus have taken many effective measures. In addition to making many practical arrangements in terms of production plans and technical data, they have also organized many on-site meetings, exhibitions, and advanced experience observation teams. These measures have played a significant role in the rapid promotion of advanced experience.

    实行产品革命　采用新工艺
    机械部门总结用料少效果大的革新项目
    本报讯　机械工业系统正在全国各地大力推广一百九十六项重大革新项目。这些项目都是技术革新和技术革命运动的成果，绝大多数容易搞、用料省、花钱少、省人多、效果大，对提高我国机械工业技术水平和促进国民经济各部门飞跃发展有重大意义。
    正在推广的一百四十一项我国自行创造的新型产品和经过改进的老产品，有新型水泵、拼焊结构水轮机、简易机床、含油轴承、电脉冲加工机床、改进解放牌汽车、微型汽车等等，其中新型水泵等二十多项产品已经纳入国家计划，在全国各地成批投入生产，其余的则正在积极进行各种准备工作。
    机械工业大力推广的五十五项重大新工艺，有“无切削加工”、“无砂铸造”、“高效率刀具”、“拼合机床加工方法”、“拼合夹具”、“拼合模具”以及“复合工艺”等等，这些新工艺项目，有一半以上已经在全国范围或部分地区广泛应用，各地应用的情况表明，这些新的工艺都在节省材料，提高劳动生产率，改善劳动条件，提高产品质量等方面收到了很大的效果。
    为了促进这些先进项目迅速在全国各地开花结果，第一机械工业部和各地机械厅局采取了很多有效的措施，除了在生产计划、技术资料等方面作了很多切实的安排外，还组织了许多现场会、展览会和先进经验观摩队。这些措施，对迅速推广先进经验起了很大的作用。
