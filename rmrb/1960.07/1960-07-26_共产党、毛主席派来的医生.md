    "Doctors sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" This is what the Tibetan people of Gannan call Comrade Li Gong. This title contains boundless trust; this title represents the greatest glory. Boundless trust cannot be easily obtained, and the greatest glory is not easily attained. The reactionary rule in history left the Tibetan people with suspicion and estrangement towards the Han people. The young doctor not only healed people's illnesses but also healed their hearts. This is not a myth, but a fact: the doctor used his own hands to cut off his own skin and draw his own blood, using the skin and blood to cure the critically ill Tibetan people, and using the skin and blood to erase the traces of that unfortunate ethnic division. This could not be done by someone without any selfish thoughts, and it could not be done by someone without deep affection for the Party and the people. Comrade Li Gong is worthy of being called "Doctors sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao," and the glory of the hero shines brightly everywhere on the grasslands.

    “共产党、毛主席派来的医生”
    谢觉哉
  “共产党、毛主席派来的医生！”甘南的藏胞对李贡同志这样称呼。这称呼包含着无限的信任；这称呼表示出最大的光荣。无限的信任不能轻易得到，最大的光荣不是垂手可得。历史上的反动统治留给藏民对汉人的怀疑
  和隔阂，年青的医生医治了人的疾病还医治了人的
  心灵。这不是神话，而是事实：医生用自己的双手割下自己的皮肤抽出自己
  的鲜血，用皮肤和鲜血治愈了垂危的藏胞的疾病，用皮肤和鲜血擦掉那不幸的民族隔阂的遗
  痕。不是毫无利己思想的人不能做到，不是对党和人民有深情厚爱的人不能做成。李贡同志不愧为“共产党、毛主席派来的医
  生”，英雄的光辉照耀得草地无处不明。
