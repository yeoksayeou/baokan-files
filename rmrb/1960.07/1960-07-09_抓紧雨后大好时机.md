In the past few days, many areas in North and Southwest China have received rainfall. This is a good thing for areas suffering from prolonged drought. We should seize this excellent opportunity after the rain to vigorously carry out water storage and conservation, rush to plant, replenish seedlings, and strengthen field management, so as to fully utilize the beneficial factors brought about by the rain. Failure to seize the opportunity will result in its loss. If we become complacent simply because it has rained, and relax our struggle against natural disasters, the beneficial factors could even turn into unfavorable ones.

Areas that are currently experiencing rain or have just experienced heavy rain and torrential rain should pay attention to inspecting the condition of water conservancy projects. One of the fundamental principles of our water conservancy construction is to prioritize water storage. Under the premise of ensuring the safety of the projects, we should store as much rainwater as possible. Any leaks discovered should be repaired immediately to prevent small leaks from becoming large ones. Even after the rain, we must still cherish water. The same applies to areas that have experienced excessive rainfall in the previous period. Drought often occurs after prolonged rain. If "Heaven" is unwilling to coordinate the rainfall, we must use water conservancy projects to force the rainwater to serve us in a more manageable way.

In some areas where the drought has been particularly severe, the summer planting tasks have not been fully completed due to the dry weather. After the rain, we must rush to plant. In some areas where summer crops are missing seedlings, we must quickly replenish them. If the season does not allow for replanting the same crops, other crops should be planted in the areas with missing seedlings. If there are too many missing seedlings and there is still time to replant, we can replant. This matter requires both decisive action and careful calculation. Cadres at all levels should consult with the masses, identify the most beneficial plan based on the current specific circumstances, and take immediate action. Starting a day or half a day earlier will bring better harvests; delaying a day or half a day will cause varying degrees of loss.

After the rain, we must quickly strengthen field management. While rain is beneficial to seedlings, it is also beneficial to weeds. When the seedlings are small, weeds will bully them and prevent them from thriving. We must fight against weeds with the same determination we used to fight the drought. Weeds cannot be eliminated in a single effort; we must remove them early when they are still small, and we must remove them repeatedly. After the rain, the surface layer of the soil easily becomes compacted, which is not conducive to crop growth or moisture retention, so it is urgent to carry out soil loosening through cultivation. Some crops may have lodged after heavy rain, requiring prompt straightening and earthing up. Cotton grows rapidly after rain, requiring timely attention to pruning. After the rain is also a good time for topdressing. It is best to combine topdressing with cultivation and earthing up in fields that need it, completing the task in one go. This saves time and manpower.

The tasks to be done after the rain are all urgent. Some areas are about to or have already entered the rainy season, making it even more necessary to seize the opportunity and concentrate efforts to focus on these tasks. These tasks also need to be properly arranged, prioritizing them based on the local specific circumstances, and focusing the main efforts on the main projects, while also taking into account the secondary projects. For example, checking and repairing water conservancy projects may be a secondary task in the current local context, and can be done well with less manpower. However, neglecting it could lead to significant losses. The priority order of planting and management should also be determined based on the specific situation. When rushing to plant and rushing to weed, the urgency of the work will vary among different production units due to differences in crops, terrain, soil quality, and rainfall; specific analysis of specific situations will lead to the most effective methods and strengthened cooperation.

July and August are the critical seasons for agricultural production. Grasping the favorable opportunity after the rain and focusing on the critical agricultural activities in the agricultural production of the region will bring great benefits to this year's agricultural production. Party committees at all levels and rural people's communes in various regions should effectively strengthen their leadership over current agricultural production.

### 抓紧雨后大好时机

    抓紧雨后大好时机
    最近几天，华北和西南有不少地区落了雨。对于久旱的地方来说，这是好事情。我们应该抓紧雨后的大好时机，努力做好蓄水、保水、抢种、补种工作，努力加强田间管理，充分发挥雨后有利因素的作用。抓得不紧，就会失去有利时机。如果因为下了雨就麻痹起来，放松了对自然灾害的斗争，有利因素还可能变成不利因素。
    正在下雨和刚下了大雨、暴雨的地区，要注意检查水利工程情况。我们兴修水利的根本方针之一是以蓄水为主。在保证工程安全的条件下，要尽可能把雨水拦蓄起来。发现漏水的情形就要立即补好，以免小漏变成大漏。下了雨仍然要珍惜水。前一时期雨下得太多了的地区也同样要注意这一点。久雨之后常常会发生旱情。“老天”不肯谐调地下雨，我们就要用水利工程迫使雨水比较驯服地为我们服务。
    有些旱灾特别严重的地方，夏种任务因天旱没有全部完成。下了雨，就要赶快抢种。有些地方夏种的作物缺苗，要赶快补种。季节不允许补种同种作物的，也要在缺苗的地方补种上别的作物。缺苗过多而又来得及重新播种的，可以重新播种。这件事情，既要当机立断，又要精细计算。各级干部要同群众商量，根据当前的具体情况，找出最有利的方案，立即行动起来。提早一天半天，会带来比较好的收成；耽搁一天半天，会造成不同程度的损失。
    雨后，要赶快加强田间管理。下了雨，对禾苗有利，对杂草也有利。在禾苗较小的情况下，杂草更会把小苗欺负得抬不起头来。一定要用抗旱的劲头对杂草作斗争。杂草一次是除不尽的，既要趁它们还小的时候早除，又要多次反复地除。雨后土壤表层容易板结，不利于作物生长，不利于保墒，这也急需中耕松土。大雨后有些作物倒伏，需要及早扶直和培土。雨后棉花生长很猛，需要及早注意整枝。雨后也是追肥的好时机。凡是需要追肥的田地，最好把追肥和中耕培土结合起来，一次完成。这样可以争时间、省人力。
    雨后要做的几项工作，都很紧迫。有些地区即将或已经进入多雨季节，更需要抓紧时机，集中力量突击这几项工作。对这几项工作也要妥善安排，根据当地当前具体情况，分别轻重缓急，把主要力量放在主要项目上，同时兼顾次要项目。像检查和修补水利工程，在当地当前可能是次要工作，用较少人力去做也能做好。可是，如果忽略了它，就有可能造成大的损失。种和管的主次先后，也要按具体情况决定。在突击抢种和突击除草的时候，各生产单位之间因作物不同、地势不同、土质不同、雨情不同，工作的缓急也就不同；对具体情况加以具体分析，就能找出最有效的办法，加强协作。
    7、8月是农业生产的关键性季节，抓住雨后的有利时机，把本地区农业生产上的关键性的农事活动抓紧抓好，会给今年的农业生产带来很大的好处。各级党委和各地农村人民公社应该切实加强对当前农业生产的领导。
