The workers say: As long as the country needs it, not to mention low output value, even if there is no profit, we will still produce it.
    (Our newspaper Hangzhou 6th dispatch) The Wenzhou Organic Chemical Plant in Zhejiang Province has established a global perspective and vigorously increased the production of key national products. Since the beginning of this year, out of the forty-eight kinds of organic chemical raw materials that have been successfully trial-produced, forty-three kinds have been put into mass production, providing a large amount of raw materials for the sustained Great Leap Forward of this factory and brother factories.
    This factory's vigorous development of organic chemical raw material production has gone through a period of ideological struggle. At the beginning of this year, the factory's workers had different understandings of how to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward. Some comrades believed that the output value of organic chemical products was low, and in order to greatly increase the output value, it was necessary to concentrate efforts on producing high-output value products. However, most comrades disagreed with this view, believing that doing so would not guarantee the state's planned products; to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward in production, it was first necessary to greatly develop basic organic chemical raw material products. The Party General Branch carefully studied these two different opinions and believed that it was necessary to enthusiastically support the opinion that took the overall situation into account. Therefore, it launched a mass movement of airing views freely, big blooming, and big debate among all the workers to conduct ideological exchanges. Many workers cited specific examples to illustrate that organic chemical raw material products are like the foundation of a house, and advanced chemical products are like pavilions; without the foundation, the pavilions cannot be built. In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory's progress in production was not great because it did not focus on organic chemical products. Some workers said excitedly: "The country urgently needs organic chemical products. With these products, we can lay the foundation for reproducing more products. It is glorious to increase the production of raw material products. Not to mention low output value, even if there is no profit, we will still produce it." After a debate, the understanding of all the workers in the factory was unified. Based on the principle of producing whatever the country needs, a mass movement to vigorously develop organic chemical raw material production was launched.
    As a result of the Wenzhou Organic Chemical Plant's vigorous efforts to develop organic chemical raw material production, not only was the need for the production of key national products guaranteed, but also an all-round leap forward was achieved. By June 25, the factory's total output value, major products, profits turned over to the state, and labor productivity had exceeded this year's national plan by 117%, 146%, 103.55%, and 112% respectively, the product quality met national requirements, the cost was greatly reduced, and it entered 1961 two hundred days ahead of schedule.

    识大体　顾全局
    温州有机化工厂大力增产国家急需产品
    职工说：只要国家需要，不用说产值低，即使没有利润，我们也要生产
    本报杭州6日电　浙江省温州市有机化工厂树立全局观点，大力增产国家重点产品。今年以来，在先后试制成功的四十八种有机化工原材料中，有四十三种已经成批投入生产，为本厂和兄弟工厂的持续大跃进提供了大量原料。
    这个厂大力发展有机化工原材料生产，是经过了一番思想斗争的。今年年初，这个厂的职工对于如何实现持续大跃进，认识是不一致的。有些同志认为生产有机化工产品产值低，要使产值大幅度增长，就要集中力量生产高产值的产品。但是，大多数同志不同意这种看法。认为这样做，国家计划产品没有保证；要使生产持续大跃进，首先要大大发展有机化工基本原料产品。党总支慎重地研究了这两种不同意见，认为必须满腔热情地支持那种识大体，顾全局的意见。于是发动全厂职工开展大鸣大放大辩论，进行思想交锋。很多职工列举具体事例说明，有机化工原材料产品好比一座房子的基础，高级化工产品好比楼阁；没有基础，楼阁便建不起来。去年第四季度厂里就因为有机化工产品没有抓紧，生产跃进的步子不大。有的工人激动地说：“国家迫切需要有机化工产品，有了这些产品就能为再生产更多的产品打下基础。增产原材料的产品是光荣的，不要说产值低，就是没有利润，我们也要生产。”经过一场争论，统一了全厂职工的认识，根据国家需要什么生产什么的原则，掀起了大搞有机化工原材料生产的群众运动。
    温州有机化工厂大搞有机化工原材料生产的结果，不仅保证国家重点产品生产的需要，而且还实现了全面跃进。到6月25日，这个厂的总产值、主要产品、上缴利润、劳动生产率已分别以117％、146％、103.55％、112％超额完成今年度国家计划，产品质量达到国家要求，成本大大下降，提前二百天跨进1961年。
