    Strive to Change the Situation of Relying on Northern Coal Transported to the South and Promote the Sustained Leap Forward in Industrial Production
    Guangdong Develops Coal Industry at High Speed
    The output of raw coal in 1959 increased more than five times compared with 1957, and the first half of this year increased by 41.6% compared with the same period last year.
    (Our newspaper Guangzhou, 26th dispatch) Guangdong Province is developing its coal industry at high speed, actively moving towards the goal of self-sufficiency in raw coal. The province's output of raw coal in 1959 increased more than five times compared to 1957; the output from January to June this year increased by 41.6% compared with the same period last year. Now, from the South China Sea in the south to Meiling in the north, from Shantou in the east to Hepu in the west, areas with coal are actively developing mines, and a number of modern mines and small coal pits are being built.
    Guangdong Province is rich in coal resources, not only for civilian coal and general industrial coal, but also coking coal in Nanling, northern Guangdong. However, before liberation, Guangdong's coal industry was very underdeveloped, and the raw coal needed mainly relied on the transport of northern coal to the south. Due to the long transport lines and many transshipments, the cost of coal transportation was very high. Relying on the transport of northern coal to the south also could not meet the ever-increasing needs of industrial development for coal. After liberation, the Party and government leading organs of Guangdong Province carried out restoration and renovation work on the original coal mines, so that coal production rose year by year. In 1958, according to the needs of the Great Leap Forward, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee put the development of the coal industry in a primary position and has carried out large-scale capital construction for more than two years. Now, the province has built a number of modern, standardized mines and a large number of small earthen kilns and small foreign wells. Coal washing plants have been built in the areas producing coking coal. The province has also built eight dedicated coal mine railways, closely connecting Nanling and other coal mines with the Beijing-Guangzhou trunk line. Another batch of coal wells, coal washing plants, and dedicated railway lines are under construction. The high-speed development of Guangdong's coal industry is changing the situation of relying on the transport of northern coal to the south. Now, the proportion of coal self-sufficiency in the province's metallurgical industry, power industry, light industry, and transportation departments, which consume the most coal, has increased significantly. This not only reduces the fuel cost of industrial enterprises, but also makes the supply of raw coal more timely, and at the same time saves the transport capacity of the north-south trunk lines, playing an important role in promoting economic development.
    The reason why Guangdong's coal industry can develop at high speed is primarily due to the strong leadership of the Party. In recent years, the secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the governor, and the main responsible persons of relevant departments have often gone deep into the coal mines to solve key problems in the development of the coal industry. The Provincial Party Committee carried out unremitting struggle against the fallacy of "no coal in the south," eliminating ideological obstacles to the development of the coal mining industry. For example, in the Nanling Coal Mine, which is rich in coking coal, some people once believed that "coal reserves are not large, the geology is complex, and mining is not cost-effective," and advocated closing down. The Provincial Party Committee promptly criticized this erroneous argument, and Comrade Chen Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, climbed over mountains and ridges several times to inspect the site, visited veteran workers, and studied the resource situation of the mine, repeatedly pointing out the important position of the Nanling Coal Mine in Guangdong Province, and resolutely advocated restoring old wells and building new wells. Now, this mine has become one of the main production bases of coking coal in Guangdong Province. The Provincial Party Committee also organized forces from all sides to support the coal industry. For more than two years, the geological department has used 60% of its strength for coalfield geological exploration. In addition to manufacturing ventilation, drainage, lifting, and other equipment for coal mines, the machinery industry department has also transferred a group of mechanical workers to specialize in repairing equipment for coal mines. The health department has also transferred the manpower and equipment of two hospitals to serve the coal mines. At the Provincial Industrial Secretary Conference held in April this year, the Provincial Party Committee further determined the policy of "taking coal as the key link and ensuring steel with coal," and the province transferred fifty-three cadres above the section level to deeply root themselves in key coal mines. Now, the main responsible persons of the Provincial Communications Department, the Provincial Basic Construction Committee, the Planning Committee, the Machinery Industry Department, and the Electricity Bureau have all settled in key coal mines to help solve key problems in production.
    Adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs" and vigorously carrying out mass movements, on the one hand developing small coal kilns, and on the other hand accelerating the construction of modern mines, is the key to the high-speed development of Guangdong's coal industry. In the mass movement of large-scale steelmaking in 1958, and in the mass-based coal grabbing war in May and June this year, hundreds of small coal kilns were developed. These small coal kilns are developed by mining, consolidating, and improving them, gradually developing from small to large. The Lianyang Coal Mine, which has now become one of Guangdong's coal bases, was developed on the basis of "small earthen groups." While developing "small earthen group" coal mines, the province has also built a number of standardized, modern small mines with an annual output of less than 150,000 tons. They have adopted mechanized equipment in ventilation, drainage, lifting, transportation, power, and other aspects. Areas with conditions have also built larger coal wells as the backbone of the province's coal industry.

### 广东高速度发展煤炭工业

    力争改变依靠北煤南运的状况促进工业生产持续跃进
    广东高速度发展煤炭工业
    1959年原煤产量比1957年增加五倍多，今年上半年又比去年同期增长41.6％
    本报广州26日电　广东省高速度发展煤炭工业，积极向原煤自给的方向前进。全省的原煤产量，1959年比1957年激增五倍多；今年1至6月的产量，又比去年同期增长了41.6％。现在，南起南海，北至梅岭，东起汕头，西至合浦，有煤的地区都在积极办矿，一批现代化矿井和小煤窑纷纷建设起来。
    广东省煤炭资源丰富，不仅有民用煤和一般工业用煤，粤北的南岭等地还产焦煤。但是，解放以前，广东的煤炭工业一直很不发达，所需原煤，主要依靠北煤南运。由于运输线长，转折多，运煤费用很高。依靠北煤南运，也不能满足工业不断发展对煤炭日益增长的需要。解放以后，广东省党政领导机关就对原有煤矿进行恢复和改造工作，使煤产量逐年上升。1958年根据大跃进的需要，中共广东省委把发展煤炭工业放在首要地位，两年多来进行了大规模的基本建设。现在，全省已经建起一些现代化的正规矿井和大量的小土窑、小洋井。在炼焦煤的产地，已经建起了洗煤厂。全省还建成八条煤矿专用铁路，把南岭等煤矿和京广干线紧密连接起来。另外一批煤井、洗煤厂和铁路专用线正在建设中。广东省煤炭工业的高速度发展，正在改变着依靠北煤南运的状况。现在，省内耗煤炭最多的冶金工业、电力工业、轻工业和交通运输部门所需的煤炭，省内自给的比重已有显著增加。这样不仅降低了工业企业的燃料成本，而且使原煤供应更加及时，同时节约了南北干线的运输力量，对促进经济发展起着重要作用。
    广东省的煤炭工业所以能高速度地发展，首先是由于党的坚强领导。几年来，广东省委的书记、省长和有关部门的主要负责人，经常深入各煤矿，解决煤炭工业发展中的关键问题。省委针对“南方无煤”的谬论进行了不懈的斗争，为煤矿工业的发展扫除了思想障碍。如盛产焦煤的南岭煤矿，曾有人认为“煤储量不多，地质复杂，开采不合算”，主张收摊子。省委及时地批判了这种错误论调，省委书记处书记陈郁同志几次翻山越岭到现场察看，访问老工人，研究这个矿的资源情况，一再指出南岭煤矿在广东省的重要地位，坚决主张恢复旧井和建设新井。现在，这个矿已经成为广东省炼焦煤的主要产地之一。省委还组织各方面力量支援煤炭工业。两年多来，地质部门以60％的力量用于煤田地质勘探。机械工业部门除了为煤矿制造通风、排水、提升等设备外，还抽调出一批机械工人专门为煤矿修理设备。卫生部门也抽调两个医院的人力和设备为煤矿服务。在今年4月间召开的全省工业书记会议上，省委进一步确定了“以煤为纲，以煤保钢”的方针，全省抽调五十三名科以上的干部深入重点煤矿安营扎寨。现在，省委交通部、省基本建设委员会、计划委员会、机械工业厅、电业局的主要负责人都已在重点煤矿落户，帮助解决生产上的关键问题。
    坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，一方面发展小煤窑，一方面加速建设现代化矿井，是广东省煤炭工业高速度发展的关键。在1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动中，在今年5、6月间群众性的夺煤大战中，都发展了成百上千的小煤窑。这些小煤窑都是边开采，边巩固，边提高，由小到大，逐步发展。现在已成为广东省煤炭基地之一的连阳煤矿，就是在“小土群”的基础上发展起来的。在发展“小土群”煤矿的同时，全省还建设了一批年产十五万吨以下的正规化、现代化的小型矿井。它们在通风、排水、提升、运输、动力等方面都采用了机械化的设备。有条件的地区，也建设较大型的煤井，作为全省煤炭工业的骨干。
