Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 8th Dispatch: Ignoring the Italian government's brutal suppression, the Italian people's anti-fascist struggle continues unabated. Strikes and demonstrations have been launched in many cities and regions across the country to protest against the authorities' atrocities and the revival of fascism.

Yesterday afternoon, in Reggio Emilia, more than 20,000 citizens gathered in Freedom Square, preparing to hold an anti-fascist demonstration in a theater. Many demonstrating youths sang guerrilla songs, and a group of people on motorcycles carried placards with slogans such as "Down with Fascism!" "Long Live the Resistance!" "Tambroni Step Down!"

By 5:00 PM, the square was packed with workers. At this point, the police opened fire on the crowd with submachine guns, rifles, and pistols, while also throwing tear gas. Demonstrators used tables and chairs to build barricades and resist the police attack. Five demonstrators were killed by the police, and more than twenty were injured.

While attacking the demonstrators, the police also forcibly drove away citizens who were willing to donate blood to the injured.

After the news of the police massacre of demonstrators in Reggio Emilia spread, the Italian General Confederation of Labor announced a general strike to be held nationwide on the 8th from 2:00 PM to 12:00 AM, and also dispatched a delegation led by General Secretary Novella to Reggio Emilia.

Currently, anti-fascist demonstrations and protests against police brutality are developing throughout Italy. Yesterday afternoon, a general strike took place in Rome. In the provinces of Bologna, Modena, Forlì, and Ferrara in the Emilia region, general strikes and demonstrations were held. In Livorno, Venice, Naples, and other provinces, as well as in Milan, Florence, Turin, and Genoa, a general strike for today had already been announced before the Italian General Confederation of Labor made its decision.

Rome, the capital, which held a large demonstration on the 6th, remains tense. At the Porta San Paolo, where the mass demonstration was held, small stones and debris used by the masses to heroically fight back against the police's attack are scattered everywhere. The government sent many trucks of fully combat-ready police officers to guard outside the parliament building, and large numbers of police forces patrolled the city.

When news of the Reggio Emilia bloodbath reached Rome, many parliamentarians in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, who were in session, protested against the government's atrocities. They shouted, "You are murderers!" "Down with the Christian Democratic Fascist Government!" However, reactionary parliamentarians shouted shamelessly and even started fighting. Italian Prime Minister Tambroni, in the Chamber of Deputies, slandered the masses' anti-fascist demonstrations as "riots" and so-called "part of an international communist conspiracy," and openly stated that he would intensify the bloody suppression.

Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti published a commentary in "Unità" today, saying that "the entire Italian people condemns the government's actions in unison."

Togliatti said that the Italian people oppose fascism, and a government standing in opposition to anti-fascist sentiment has no political foothold. Togliatti condemned the current Italian government's shameful alliance with fascism.

Togliatti said that the Italian people's democratic and anti-fascist sentiments will inspire everyone to strive for the establishment of a new government.

    勒佐—艾米里亚警察竟用机关枪屠杀示威群众
    意大利各地罢工反击政府暴行
    广大群众和不少议员要法西斯政府下台
    新华社8日讯　罗马消息：不顾意大利政府的残暴镇压，意大利人民的反法西斯斗争再接再厉，全国许多城市和地区都掀起罢工和示威，抗议当局的暴行和法西斯主义复活。
    昨天下午，在勒佐—艾米里亚，两万多市民汇集在自由广场上，准备到一个剧院去举行反法西斯示威集会。许多示威青年唱着游击队的歌曲，一批乘摩托车的人带着标语牌，上面写着：“打倒法西斯主义！”“抵抗运动万岁！”“塔姆布罗尼下台！”
    到下午五时，广场上挤满了工人。这时警察用手提机关枪、步枪和手枪向群众开火，同时还投掷催泪弹。示威者用桌椅堆成路障，抵抗警察的进攻。有五个示威者被警察打死，二十多人受伤。
  警察在向示威群众进攻的时候，还用武力驱走愿意为受伤者输血的市民们。
    警察在勒佐—艾米里亚屠杀示威者的消息传出后，意大利总工会宣布要在8日从十四时到二十四时在全国各地举行总罢工，同时派遣以总书记诺维拉为首的代表团到勒佐—艾米里亚去。
    现在，意大利全国各地反法西斯示威和反对警察暴行的抗议行动正在发展。昨天下午，在罗马发生了总罢工。在艾米里亚区的波伦亚、摩德纳、福利、和斐拉拉各省，举行了总罢工和示威。在里窝那、威尼斯、那不勒斯和其它省份，在米兰、佛罗伦萨、都灵和热那亚，已经在意大利总工会作出决定之前宣布在今天举行总罢工。
    在6日举行大示威后的首都罗马，目前仍然是一片紧张气氛。在举行群众示威的圣保罗门，到处都布满群众用来英勇反击警察的进攻的小石块和碎片。政府派出许多卡车的全副作战准备的警察在议会大楼外面布岗，大量警察部队在城市里到处巡逻。
    当勒佐—艾米里亚流血惨案的消息传到罗马的时候，正在开会的参众两院里有不少议员对政府的暴行提出抗议。他们高呼：“你们是杀人犯！”“天主教民主党法西斯政府下台！”但是，反动议员却无耻地大叫大嚷，甚至动手打人。意大利总理塔姆布罗尼在众议院里把群众的反法西斯示威诬蔑为“骚动”和所谓“国际共产主义阴谋的一部分”，并且公然表示要加紧血腥镇压。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂今天在“团结报”上发表评论说，“意大利全国人民同声谴责政府的行动”。
    陶里亚蒂说，意大利人民群众反对法西斯主义，站在同反法西斯情绪对抗的立场上的政府，在政治上已经站不住脚。陶里亚蒂谴责目前意大利政府同法西斯主义的可耻联盟。
    陶里亚蒂说，意大利人民民主和反法西斯的感情，将鼓舞大家争取建立一个新的政府。
