    People all love the scenery of Jiangnan,
    With myriad purples and reds, and lush green shade.
    In the past, the scenery was heaven-sent,
    But now the scenery is created by heroes.
    Production fighters wave their sweat,
    Moving Jiangnan to the Gobi desert.

    This is a poem written by an ordinary soldier of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. It reflects the heroic spirit of the soldiers in conquering nature and their tremendous achievements in building the frontier of the motherland.
    Since the beginning of summer, the Junggar Basin's Manas River basin has been filled with boundless wheat fields, golden rapeseed flowers, and tender green cotton seedlings. Rows of windbreaks, stretching for dozens of kilometers, protect all farmland from wind and sand. Intersecting canals are woven into the field like brocade. At the upper reaches of the canals, you can see many sky-blue man-made lakes (reservoirs) shining in the sun. Ten years ago, this was a desolate Gobi, known as the boundless wasteland. In the blink of an eye, it has become an agricultural base of the motherland with seventy-one mechanized farms and four million mu of various crops, attracting a constant stream of visitors from home and abroad, and is known as the "Jiangnan on the Gobi" and the "Garden in the Desert."

    Leaders

    In the early spring of 1950, a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, accepting Chairman Mao's order on the army's participation in production, carrying luggage and tools, and filled with the ambition to conquer nature, marched into the Junggar Basin, where the sand flowed and shifted. The soldiers started from scratch with their hands and a hoe, reclaiming wasteland and cultivating fields. In those difficult years, the battle-tested "old revolutionaries" always stood at the forefront of the struggle. Gao Youfu, an old Red Army soldier in the Kuitun reclamation area, is a shining example. In the initial land reclamation in 1950, he used his two hands to clear two or three mu of red willow in a day. After a night's rest, his ten fingers were so swollen that he could not close them. The next morning, his hand could not hold the hoe, so he clamped it with his arm and went to the ground. Once there, he endured the pain and gripped the hoe again. From 1950 to the present, he has led the workers to open up ten agricultural and pastoral farms, and always handed over the completed farms to others, and then went to new wastelands. One year, he led a unit deep into the Liugou area of the Junggar Basin, where water was extremely scarce, to open up a new farm. The hoe dug down twenty-three meters, but it was still dry sand. Gao Youfu led everyone to withstand the unbearable thirst, digging wells while opening canals to divert water. After more than twenty days of hard work, they finally diverted water from the Sikeshu River. In this place where no water could be seen, they developed two farms in the same year.

    This old Red Army soldier, who came from a farmhand background, is now in his fifties. He joined the guerrillas from the time Liu Zhidan led the peasant uprising, and was later known as the "He Long artilleryman" in battle. He attended the "Border Region Model Worker Conference" during the Nanniwan production campaign in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He is now the head of the Jinghe-Bole General Farm, which consists of seven newly opened agricultural (pastoral) branch farms in the Junggar Basin. During the spring planting this year, in the battle to command land reclamation and sowing, he still challenged the young cadres of the farm headquarters to reclaim wasteland, with the same vigor as in Nanniwan. Within ten days, his hands were covered with blisters, and he cleared seven mu of wasteland overgrown with thorns. Under his leadership, the cadres of various farms in Jinghe and Bole reclaimed more than 700 mu of wasteland during the spring plowing.

    Conquering the Drought Demon

    The Junggar Basin is located in the hinterland of the Asian continent, with an annual rainfall of only 170 millimeters, while the evaporation exceeds the rainfall by ten times. Due to the lack of water, for thousands of years, the farmers living on both banks of the Manas River have only cultivated more than 500,000 mu of farmland on the southern edge of the basin, and some of the crops suffer from drought every year. More than a hundred years ago, the rulers of the Qing Dynasty tried to introduce water into the center of the Junggar Basin—Mosuowan—in order to use the army to conquer this place, but they were forced to retreat because they could not control the drought. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers used only six months to bring water to this place. In the past two years, more than 600,000 mu of irrigated land have been reclaimed in this wasteland, and six farms have been built.

    The soldiers who developed Mosuowan encountered the unique heat and thirst of the desert in summer. The fiery sun baked the soldiers, causing them to sweat profusely. Waves of hot wind rolled up the sky-covering yellow sand. Unable to find a water source, the soldiers could only moisten their throats with a drop of water. However, the belief in conquering drought, transforming nature, and building the great border region of the motherland strongly supported them. Whether their throats were hoarse from thirst or their skin was peeled by the scorching sun, the battle to seize water never stopped.

    In the early winter of 1958, the canal was completed, and the water of the Manas River flowed into the center of the Junggar Basin for the first time along the east bank canal. The soldiers irrigated the newly reclaimed wasteland day and night, rushing to plant winter wheat. At this moment, a branch canal of the Communist Youth League farm downstream of the east bank canal was suddenly washed away. The soldiers could not block the water flow with red willow ropes, and the precious river water flowed straight onto the Gobi. At this critical moment, Zhang Yin, the Communist Party member and head of the watering team, led all the soldiers to jump into the biting cold water. The icy water turned the soldiers' bodies purple. When the breach could not be blocked, the soldiers took off their cotton coats and shirts to block it. The breach was repaired, and the soldiers quickly dried their clothes and plunged back into the watering battle.

    For ten years, the soldiers have used this heroic spirit, regardless of winter and summer, and regardless of wind and snow, to build 15,000 kilometers of fixed channels and many large, medium and small reservoirs with a water storage capacity of 600 million cubic meters on the Gobi desert of more than 12,000 square kilometers, controlling the Manas River basin consisting of eight rivers including the Tasi River in the east and the Gurtu River in the west, including the Sikeshu River and the Kuitun River, making it a self-flowing irrigation network that can be controlled by people.

    Catching Up with Each Other

    This year, the crops planted by the production troops in the Manas River basin will be nearly doubled compared to last year. At the beginning of spring, tractors roared day and night on the vast Junggar plain, with people stopping but machines not stopping, rushing to reclaim land and sow seeds day and night. At this critical juncture, Xu Jianglin, who was determined to surpass and catch up with Hou Zhengyuan, found that the water pump on his locomotive was leaking. "A major repair would require stopping the vehicle for two days, which would mean planting five or six hundred fewer mu of land." Thinking of this, Xu Jianglin immediately dismissed the idea of stopping the vehicle to repair the water pump. He and his five team members took turns repairing the water pump with two broken water pumps, insisting on working non-stop, ensuring the normal operation of the tractor, and overfulfilling the spring sowing plan.

    Xu Jianglin—this young Communist Party member—is a tractor driver at the Chepaizi Farm in the Kuitun reclamation area, and also a well-known rising star among the tractor drivers in this area. The amount of work completed in the first four months of this year exceeded the performance of the tractor team of Hou Zhengyuan, the model tractor driver of the entire Production and Construction Corps, during the same period.

    Hou Zhengyuan is an experienced tractor driver in the Shihezi reclamation area. He is famous for cherishing his vehicle as if it were his own life and completing the most and best work. For more than four years, his locomotive has been safely running for more than 19,000 hours without major repairs, completing the workload stipulated by the state for 23 and a half years, and is a role model for all tractor drivers in this area. In early May this year, Hou Zhengyuan and Xu Jianglin attended the mobilization meeting of machinery heroes of the entire Production and Construction Corps. At the meeting, Hou Zhengyuan heard the news that Xu Jianglin's locomotive team had surpassed his own, and was so excited that he did not close his eyes all night. On the night the meeting ended, some of his comrades danced, some watched movies, but his mind was churning. At midnight, when his comrades were asleep, he tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. "The idea of being afraid of being slow and only afraid of standing still has made me lag behind. I must seize every minute and second to catch up." So, he quietly got up, and in the moonlight, rode his bicycle back to his farming team overnight. From that day on, Hou Zhengyuan led the locomotive team to seize every second, sending people to check the road that the tractor would pass through the next day and remove obstacles. Tall reeds were inserted in advance on each cultivated land according to the tractor's row spacing to avoid wasting time when the locomotive turned to check the row spacing. When the tractor was spraying to control insects, the number of sprayers was doubled. Previously, the tractor hauled two trailers to transport fertilizer, but now it was increased to four. Since grasping these small details, the efficiency has rapidly increased by four and a half times. When we left Hou Zhengyuan that day, their locomotive team and Xu Jianglin's locomotive team were only half a day's work apart.

    Marching Towards Science

    The heroic soldiers not only created high-speed miracles in the large-scale land reclamation and farm construction to conquer nature, but also created outstanding achievements in conquering the agricultural science fortress. The Junggar Basin is located at 45 degrees north latitude, and the frost-free period is generally only about 140 days. In the past, bourgeois scholars always believed that cotton could not be grown here, but the heroic soldiers have created the highest national cotton yield records here several times. Let's see how he (she) conquered the scientific fortress in production activities. In 1954, Tan Shufeng, a seventeen-year-old Shandong girl, came to the Paotai Farm. The leadership asked her to manage cotton, but she didn't even know how to thin seedlings. She heard that there was a cotton-planting expert in the farm named Liu Xuefo, who had not attended school for a few days since he was a child, but he was willing to study and accumulate a set of cotton-planting experience. He had created the highest national cotton yield record twice in a row. Agricultural professors who came to visit from various places admired him as a cotton-planting expert. The young girl envied Liu Xuefo and was determined to learn his pioneering spirit. In the past few years, relying on her limited elementary school education, she used all production gaps to diligently study cotton planting techniques and repeatedly pondered the cotton planting experience written by Liu Xuefo himself. More importantly, she closely combined the book knowledge she had learned with production practice, exploring the relationship between local climate, soil, groundwater level, pest occurrence time and other natural laws and cotton high yield. Last year, based on her daily observations and detailed records in the cotton field, she found that in cotton fields with a groundwater level as high as 1.3 meters, the long watering period resulted in each cotton seedling growing a fruit branch every eight to ten centimeters, the fruit nodes were compact, and there were many cotton bolls. In cotton fields with a short watering period, the cotton plants grew very fast, but the fruit branches were sparse, with one every fifteen centimeters or so. From this, she found the watering rule for cotton fields similar to this, and controlled the excessive growth of cotton. Last year, the climate was extremely abnormal during the cotton seedling stage, and the cotton seedlings developed slowly. However, there was a lot of fertilizer in the ground. When the temperature steadily rose in mid-summer, the cotton seedlings grew quickly and vigorously again. According to past habits, this was already the time to top the cotton. Based on this new situation, she appropriately postponed the topping time, thus avoiding the phenomenon that after topping, the cotton grew too vigorously, regenerating many new branches and leaves around it, hindering cotton ventilation and light transmission, and causing the lower buds and bolls to fall off. It was precisely because she mastered this set of natural laws and flexibly applied various technical measures that the 312 mu of cotton planted by the cotton planting team she led last year averaged 370 jin of seed cotton per mu, of which 80 mu averaged 835 jin of seed cotton per mu, and 1.2 mu of cotton experimental field averaged 1,793 jin of seed cotton per mu, breaking the national record for highest yield per mu set twice by Liu Xuefo. Her teacher—Liu Xuefo, who is now the director of the Shajingzi Seed Breeding Farm in the Aksu reclamation area—specially wrote a letter to congratulate her and expressed his intention to learn from her.

    In various production units, there are many soldiers from working-class and peasant backgrounds who are diligent in studying and hard work like Tan Shufeng. It is precisely because these people have inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army of heroism, tenacity, and hard work that they have been able to turn the ancient wasteland into a beautiful oasis in just ten years.

    Leap forward, heroes who build the Junggar Basin!

    开拓荒原的人们
    都爱江南风光好，
    万紫千红绿荫绕，
    过去风景天生就，
    如今风景英雄造，
    生产战士一挥汗，
    江南搬到戈壁滩。
    这是新疆生产建设兵团一个普通战士写的诗，它反映出战士们征服大自然的英雄气概；反映出战士们建设祖国边疆的巨大成就。
    入夏以来，准噶尔盆地玛纳斯河流域一带，到处是一望无际的麦海、金黄的菜花和嫩绿的棉苗。一条条长达数十公里的防风林带，保护着所有农田不受风沙侵袭。纵横的水渠，交织在如锦的田野里。水渠的上源，可以看见不少天蓝色的人造湖（水库），在阳光下闪闪发光。十年以前，这里还是一片戈壁，被人们称为瀚海荒原。转眼之间，已变成一个拥有七十一个机械化农场、播种着四百万亩各种作物的祖国农业基地，它吸引着国内外人士不断前来参观访问，被誉为“戈壁上的江南”“沙漠中的花园。”
    带头人
    1950年早春，一支中国人民解放军部队，接受了毛主席发布的关于军队参加生产的命令，背着行李，扛着工具，怀着征服大自然的雄心壮志，浩浩荡荡地开进了这一泻千里、流沙起伏的准噶尔盆地。战士们凭着双手和一把砍土镘（类似镢头的工具），白手起家，开荒造田。在那些艰苦的岁月里，久经战斗考验的“老革命”，总是站在斗争的最前线。奎屯垦区的老红军高有富就是一个光辉的榜样。1950年最初开荒时，一天用两只手开二、三亩红柳。夜晚一休息，十指肿的合不拢。第二天早晨，他的手握不住砍土镘，便用胳臂夹着下地，一到地里又忍痛握紧砍土镘再干。从1950年到现在，他率领着职工们共开辟出十个农牧场，而又总是将建好的农场交给别人，自己又转战在新的荒地上。有一年，他率领一支部队，深入准噶尔盆地异常缺水的柳沟地区开辟新农场，镢头挖下二十三米，还是干沙土。高有富领导大家顶住难忍的干渴，一边挖井，一边开渠引水，经过二十多天的苦战，终于引下了四棵树河的水，在这滴水不见的地方，当年就开发出两个农场。
    这个长工出身的老红军，今年五十多岁了。从刘志丹领导农民暴动起，他就参加了游击队，而后在战斗中又被誉为“贺龙炮手”，在陕甘宁边区南泥湾大生产中，曾出席过“边区劳模会”。现在担任着新开辟的准噶尔盆地七个农（牧）分场的精（河）博（乐）总场的场长。今年春播时，在指挥开荒播种的战斗中，仍和场部的青年干部挑战开荒，比当年南泥湾开荒的干劲。十天内双手打满了血泡，开出七亩荆棘丛生的荒地。在他的带动下，精博各农场的干部，春耕期间共开垦出七百多亩荒地。
    征服旱魔
    准噶尔盆地位于亚洲大陆腹地，年降雨量只一百七十多毫米，而蒸发量却超过降雨量十倍，气候十分干旱。因为缺水，千百年来居住在玛纳斯河流域各河两岸的农民，只在盆地南缘开垦出五十多万亩农田，还有一部分庄稼年年受旱。一百多年前，清朝的统治者曾经试图把水引入准噶尔盆地中心——莫索湾，以屯垦的军队征服这个地方，可是终因制服不了干旱，被迫退了出来。英雄的人民战士在大跃进的1958年，只用了半年多时间，就把水引到了这个地方。两年来，在这片荒原上，开垦出六十多万亩水浇田，兴建起六个农场。
    开发莫索湾的战士们，在这里遇到了夏季沙漠中特有的酷热和干渴，火红的太阳烤得战士们个个挥汗如雨，阵阵热风卷着遮天蔽日的黄沙，找不到水源，战士们只能用一滴水润一润喉咙。但是，征服干旱，改造自然，建设伟大祖国边疆的信念，强烈地支持着他们。不论是干渴的沙哑了嗓子，还是烈日晒得脱了皮，夺水大战却一刻不停。
    1958年初冬，渠修好了，玛纳斯河水第一次顺着东岸大渠，流进准噶尔盆地中心。战士们日夜浇灌着新垦的荒地抢种冬麦。正在这时，东岸大渠下游的共青团农场的一条干渠突然被冲垮了，战士们用红柳索索怎么也堵不住水头，贵如油一般的河水直往戈壁滩上流。在这紧急关头，浇水班长共产党员张印，带动全班战士一起跳到刺骨的水中，冰冷的水冻紫了战士们的身体，决口堵不住，战士们又脱下棉衣、衬衣堵。决口修复了，战士们迅速烤干了衣服，又投入浇水战斗。
    十年来，战士们就以这种豪迈的英雄气概，不分冬夏，不避风雪，在一万两千多平方公里的戈壁荒原上，兴修起长达一万五千公里的固定渠道和蓄水达六亿公方的许多大、中、小型水库，制服了东起塔西河、西至古尔图河，包括四棵树河、奎屯河等八条河流组成的玛纳斯河流域，使它形成了一个听人使唤的自流灌溉网。
    你追我赶
    今年，生产部队在玛纳斯河流域种的庄稼，要比去年扩大近一倍。一开春，辽阔的准噶尔平原上，拖拉机日夜轰鸣，人停机不停，日夜突击开荒播种。就在这个关节眼上，一心超、赶侯正元的徐江林，他的机车上的水泵漏水了，“大修吧，得停两天车，要少种五、六百亩地”。想到这里，徐江林立刻打消了停车修水泵的念头，他和他的五个组员，用两个破水泵轮换着修理，一刻不停的坚持工作，保证了拖拉机正常运转，超额完成了春播计划。
    徐江林——这个年青的共产党员，是奎屯垦区车排子农场的拖拉机手，也是这一带拖拉机手中有名的后起之秀。今年前四个月完成的工作量，超过了全生产兵团拖拉机标兵侯正元机车组同期完成的成绩。
    侯正元是石河子垦区的一名拖拉机老手，他以爱车如命，完成工作量最多最好驰名。四年多来他的机车安全行驶一万九千多个小时无大修，完成了国家规定的二十三年半的工作量，是这一带所有的拖拉机手心目中学习的榜样。今年5月初，侯正元和徐江林一起出席了全兵团的机务英雄跃进誓师大会。会上侯正元听到了徐江林机车组超过自己的消息，激动的彻夜没有合眼。会议结束的那天晚上，伙伴们跳舞的跳舞，看电影的看电影，他的思想翻腾着，午夜，同志们睡熟了，他躺在床上翻来翻去睡不着，“不怕慢只怕站的思想使自己落后了，争分夺秒赶上去”。于是，他悄悄起来，借着月光，骑上自行车，连夜赶回自己的机耕队。从那天起，侯正元领导机车组抓紧每一秒钟时间，每天派人把第二天拖拉机要通过的道路检查一遍，清除障碍，每块耕作地事先都按拖拉机的行距插上高高的芦苇，免得机车转弯时为了瞅行距浪费时间。拖拉机喷雾治虫时，增加一倍喷雾器，原先拖拉机运肥时挂两辆拖车，现在增加到四辆。自从抓紧了这每一个细小环节后，工效迅速提高了四倍半。我们离开侯正元那天，他们机车组和徐江林机车组相差半天的工作量了。
    向科学进军
    英雄的战士，不仅在征服自然的大规模开荒建场中，创造了高速度的奇迹；在攻克农业科学堡垒方面，也创造出出色的成绩。准噶尔盆地位于北纬四十五度，无霜期一般只有一百四十天左右。从前，资产阶级学者一贯认为这里不能种棉花，可是英雄的战士们却几次在这里创造出全国棉花最高丰产纪录。且看他（她）们在生产活动中是怎样攻克科学堡垒的。1954年，一个年仅十七岁的山东姑娘谭淑凤，从家乡来到炮台农场，领导上让她管理棉花，她连间苗也不懂，听说场里有个植棉能手刘学佛，从小没有上过几天学，就是肯钻研、肯学习，积累了一套植棉经验，连续两次创造了全国棉花最高丰产纪录，各地前来参观的农业教授，无不钦佩地称他为植棉专家。年青的姑娘羡慕刘学佛，立志学习他的首创精神。几年来，她凭着自己仅有的初小文化程度，利用一切生产空隙，苦钻植棉技术，反复琢磨刘学佛亲手编写的植棉经验。更重要的是，她把学来的书本知识和生产实践密切结合起来，摸索当地的气候、土壤、地下水位高低、虫害发生时间等自然规律和棉花丰产的关系。去年，她根据每天在棉田中的观察和详细记载，发现地下水位高达一点三米的棉田，浇水期距长的，每株棉苗每隔八到十公分便长一个果枝，果节紧凑，棉铃多。浇水期距短的，棉株长的很快，果枝反倒稀了，每隔十五厘米左右才有一个。由此，她找到了类似这种棉田的浇水规律，控制了棉花疯长。去年，棉花幼苗期，气候极不正常，棉苗发育迟缓，可是地里肥料多，到了中夏时分，气温稳定上升后，棉苗长的又快又旺，按往年的习惯，这时已经是快打顶的时候了。她根据这种新的情况，适当推迟了打顶的时间，这样就避免了打顶后因为棉花生长过旺、四周再生许多新的枝叶、妨碍棉花通风透光，造成下部蕾铃脱落的现象。正是由于她掌握了这一套自然规律，灵活的应用了各项技术措施，去年，她领导的植棉组种植的三百十二亩棉花，平均每亩单产籽棉三百七十斤，其中有八十亩平均单产籽棉八百三十五斤，一点二亩棉花试验田，平均每亩收籽棉一千七百九十三斤，打破了刘学佛两次创造的全国最高丰产纪录。她的老师——现在已担任了阿克苏垦区沙井子良种繁育场场长的刘学佛，还特意写信祝贺她，并表示向她学习。
    在各生产部队，像谭淑凤一样勤学苦钻的工农出身的战士很多。正是由于这些人继承和发扬了中国人民解放军英勇顽强、艰苦朴素的优良传统，才能在这短短的十年内，将万古荒原，开拓成美丽的绿洲。
    飞跃吧，建设准噶尔盆地的英雄们。
