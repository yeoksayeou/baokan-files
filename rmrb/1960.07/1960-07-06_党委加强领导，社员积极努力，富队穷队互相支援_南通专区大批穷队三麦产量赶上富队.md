    Party Committee Strengthens Leadership, Commune Members Work Actively, Rich and Poor Teams Support Each Other
    A Large Number of Poor Teams in Nantong Prefecture Catch Up with Rich Teams in Triple Wheat Yield
    (Our Dispatch) This year, among the 695 "poor teams" in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, the wheat yield of 83 production brigades has caught up with or exceeded that of the rich teams, and 320 poor teams have basically caught up with the production level of the rich teams. Now, these production brigades are advancing victoriously and are fully engaged in the field management of current autumn crops, striving for a greater bumper harvest of autumn crops.
    The rapid catch-up of the poor teams' triple wheat yield is the result of hard work last winter and this spring. The common characteristics of these poor teams are poor water, fertilizer, and soil conditions, and a poor foundation. In the "Surpass the Yangtze River and Compete with Suzhou" movement, they put forward the battle slogan of "Poor teams have high aspirations, determined to surpass rich teams and overtake Suzhou." Since last winter, they have fully launched a mass movement to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, and improve the soil. Zhaoming Commune in Rugao County, which has always been low-yielding, organized a water conservancy professional team of more than 3,000 people. With the support of the state and the help of fraternal communes, they worked hard throughout the winter and spring, digging 55 small rivers, basically realizing a river network, completely changing the prone-to-flooding and drought-prone conditions. Since last autumn sowing, they have carried out three large-scale surprise fertilizer accumulation movements in succession, greatly increasing the amount of fertilizer applied, thus greatly changing the barren land and perennial low-yield situation. This year, more than 10,000 mu of triple wheat has achieved a comprehensive high yield. Jifan Commune in Nantong County had a yield of less than 100 jin per mu in previous years due to saline-alkali land. During autumn sowing last year, through measures such as spreading raw grass to cover the soil, diverting fresh water to wash away alkali, vigorously developing grass pond mud, running livestock farms on a large scale, increasing fertilizer application, and meticulous management, this year's triple wheat yield increased by an average of 77% compared with 1959, catching up with the surrounding rich teams.
    In the movement to vigorously increase the triple wheat yield, all localities launched the communist large-scale collaboration of "poor catching up with the rich, rich helping the poor." When Nanping Commune's Xu Hong and Tuanjie, two poor teams in Hai'an County, lacked tools and labor for fertilizer accumulation last winter, Yu Zhuang Brigade automatically lent them machines to support them. Fenghuang and Shuguang teams also supported them with more than 300 laborers. After five days of concentrated effort, more than 500,000 dan of river mud were accumulated, and each mu of more than 3,000 mu of fields was covered with more than 200 dan of winter fertilizer. The 18th Brigade of Wanghao Commune in Haimen County, seeing that the neighboring 17th Brigade lacked base fertilizer for autumn sowing, organized more than 90 commune members to transport hundreds of dan of the best human and animal manure to the fraternal poor team overnight. The Central Brigade of this commune also voluntarily lent 400 yuan to support the 17th Brigade in purchasing manure fertilizer, ensuring that the team applied base fertilizer for autumn sowing.
    For the comprehensive high yield of triple wheat, the Party committees at all levels in Nantong Prefecture, from the autumn sowing to the wheat harvest, sent a large number of cadres, adopting methods such as establishing model pacesetters, vigorously developing "small Suzhou," and planting command fields, to lead the poor teams to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the rich teams. The Haimen County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred more than 300 cadres from the county-level organs, led by the County Party Secretary, to go deep into the communes to effectively strengthen the leadership of the poor teams. The Datong Commune in Qidong County, led by the Party Secretary, organized a working group for the liberation of poor teams, stationed in the 7th Brigade, mobilized the commune members to strengthen the field management of wheat, so that all the third-class seedlings caught up with the first-class seedlings, and the triple wheat yield of the whole team achieved a bumper harvest. Renqiao Commune in Hai'an County established thousand-head pig farms in five poor teams, including Siyu. After these poor teams increased the application of a large amount of pig manure, the wheat yield per mu this year increased by 60%-100% compared with last year.
    The great summer harvest has further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members of the poor teams. Under the encouragement of the slogan "Poor but not discouraged, rich but not arrogant, make persistent efforts, and firmly grasp the present," they actively engaged in the summer planting and summer management movement, striving to catch up with and surpass the rich teams in the annual yield, and completely change the face of the poor teams. The Party Committee of Zhongyi Commune in Nantong County, facing the situation of timely transplanting of mid-season rice affected by salt water, the Commune Party Secretary Cao Guobin personally took command, organized more than 360 laborers, and rushed to build three river dams overnight, concentrating six water pumps to pump water, drain salt water, and introduce fresh water. They also organized a large number of laborers to puddle the fields and prepare the land, completing the transplanting of mid-season rice in a timely manner. Daxing Commune in Qidong County firmly grasped the four major measures of pest control, intertillage, seedling fixing, and fertilization, and comprehensively launched the cotton field management movement, while vigorously accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer.

    党委加强领导，社员积极努力，富队穷队互相支援
    南通专区大批穷队三麦产量赶上富队
    本报讯　江苏南通专区六百九十五个“穷队”中，今年有八十三个生产大队麦子的产量赶上或超过了富队，有三百二十个穷队，已基本赶上了富队的产量水平。现在，这些生产大队正乘胜前进，全力投入当前秋熟作物的田间管理，力争秋熟作物更大的丰收。
    穷队的三麦产量能够迅速赶上富队，是去冬今春苦干的结果。这些穷队共同的特点是水、肥、土条件差，底子穷。在“跨过长江赛苏州”的运动中，他们提出“穷队人民志气高，决心跨过富队超苏州”的战斗口号，从去年冬季以来，全面开展了大兴水利、大搞积肥和改良土壤的群众运动。一向低产的如皋县赵明公社，组织了三千多人的水利专业队伍，在国家支援和兄弟社的帮助下，苦战一冬春，开挖了五十五条小型河道，基本上实现了河网化，彻底改变了易涝易旱的面貌，并从去年秋播以来，连续开展了三次大规模的突击积肥运动，施肥量大增，因而大大改变了土地瘠薄、历年低产的状况，今年一万多亩三麦，取得了全面高产。南通县济凡公社，盐碱地历年的产量不到一百斤。去年秋播时通过铺生盖草，引淡洗碱，大搞草塘泥，大办畜牧场，增施肥料，精细管理等措施，今年的三麦产量平均单产比1959年增长了77％，赶上了周围的富队。
    在大搞三麦高产运动中，各地都开展了“穷赶富、富帮穷”的共产主义大协作。海安县南屏公社旭红、团结两个穷队，去年冬天积肥时缺少工具和劳力，余庄大队自动借机器支援他们，凤凰和曙光两个队，还支援他们三百多个劳力，经过五天突击，积河泥五十多万担，三千多亩田每亩盖上了二百多担腊肥。海门县王浩公社十八大队，看到毗邻的十七大队秋播基肥不足便组织九十多个社员，把最好的几百担人畜粪，连夜运送到兄弟穷队。这个社的中心大队，还主动借出四百元，支持十七大队购买粪肥，保证了这个队的秋播施上了底肥。
    为了三麦全面高产，南通专区各级党委从秋播开始到麦子收割，派出了大批干部，采取大树标兵，大搞“小苏州”，大种指挥田等办法，领导穷队学、赶、超富队的运动。中共海门县委在县直机关抽调了三百多名干部，由县委书记带领深入各公社切实加强对穷队的领导。启东县大同公社，以党委书记为首，组织了穷队翻身工作组，坐镇第七大队，发动社员群众加强麦子田间管理，使全部三类苗赶上一类苗，全队的三麦产量获得了大丰收。海安县仁乔公社，在四榆等五个穷队，都办起了千头养猪场，使这些穷队在增施了大量的猪肥以后，今年的麦子亩产量，都比去年增长60％—100％以上。
    夏熟的大丰收，更加激励了穷队社员群众的革命干劲。在“穷不失志，富不骄傲，再接再厉，狠抓当前”的口号鼓舞下，积极投入了夏种夏管运动，争取全年产量赶富队、超富队，彻底改变穷队面貌。南通县忠义公社党委，在面临咸水影响中稻及时移栽的情况下，公社党委书记曹国宾亲自挂帅，组织了三百六十多个劳力，突击一夜打好三条河坝，集中六台抽水机抽水，排出咸水，引进淡水，并组织大批劳力，沤田整地，一气呵成，适时完成了中稻栽插。启东县大兴公社，狠抓治虫、中耕、定苗、施肥等四大措施，全面展开了棉田管理运动，同时，大搞积肥造肥。
