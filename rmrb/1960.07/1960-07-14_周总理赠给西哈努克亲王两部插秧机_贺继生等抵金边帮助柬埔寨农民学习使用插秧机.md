Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 12th: Two Chinese rice transplanters, "Liling No. 2" and "Nan 105B," gifts from Premier Zhou Enlai to Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, arrived here today by special plane. The inventors of these two rice transplanters, He Jisheng and Ni Yiwei, also arrived on the same plane. They will teach Cambodian farmers how to use and manufacture rice transplanters.

During Premier Zhou Enlai's recent visit to Cambodia, the Cambodian authorities only requested that the drawings of the Chinese-invented rice transplanter be given to the Cambodian government. However, Premier Zhou Enlai also agreed to give them two rice transplanters in addition to the drawings.

Cambodian officials in charge of agriculture, including Bu Long, and other personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture, greeted them at the airport today. Zheng Ping, First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy, was also present at the airport to welcome them.

Like other Asian countries, Cambodian farmers transplant rice seedlings through arduous manual labor. Therefore, the Cambodian government and people sincerely welcome these gifts. The latest issue of the weekly "Nationalist" wrote: "We express our sincere gratitude to the Chinese leaders who wisely sent us this aid, which may truly improve the living standards of our farmers."

The newspaper also said that, in recognition of this generous assistance, Prince Sihanouk has instructed the Royal Government to invite Chinese technicians with rice transplanters to travel to various provinces of Cambodia in order to teach Cambodian farmers how to use this rice transplanter during their short stay.

　　周总理赠给西哈努克亲王两部插秧机
　　贺继生等抵金边帮助柬埔寨农民学习使用插秧机
    新华社金边12日电　周恩来总理送给柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王的礼物——“醴陵二号”和“南一○五B型”中国水稻插秧机各一部，今天由专机运到这里。这两部插秧机的发明人贺继生和倪已维也同机来到这里，他们将教柬埔寨农民如何使用和制造插秧机。
    在周恩来总理最近访问柬埔寨期间，柬埔寨当局只要求把中国发明的水稻插秧机的图样送给柬埔寨政府，但是，周恩来总理还同意除此之外再送给它两部水稻插秧机。
    柬埔寨负责农业的官员布龙和农业部的其他人员今天到机场迎接。到机场迎接的还有中国大使馆一等秘书郑平。
    同其他亚洲国家一样，柬埔寨的农民是用艰苦的手工劳动插秧的，所以柬埔寨政府和人民衷心欢迎这些礼物。最近一期的“民族主义者”周刊写道：“我们对于明智地送给我们这种援助的中国领导人表示诚挚的感谢，这种援助可能真正地提高我们的农民的生活水平。”
    这家报纸又说，为了这一慷慨的援助，西哈努克亲王已经指示王国政府邀请中国技术人员带着插秧机到柬埔寨各省旅行，以便在他们很短的逗留期间内教柬埔寨农民学习使用这种水稻插秧机。
