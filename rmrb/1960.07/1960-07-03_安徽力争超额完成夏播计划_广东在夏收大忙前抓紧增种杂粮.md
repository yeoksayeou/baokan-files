Xinhua News Agency, Hefei - Anhui is seizing the time to rush planting, striving to complete and exceed the summer planting plan as quickly as possible. To date, most areas of the province have completed the summer planting plan. Counties and people's communes that have not yet completed the plan are accelerating the progress of summer planting. Counties such as Susong and Taihu in Anqing Prefecture, which have already exceeded the plan, are advancing towards wasteland lakes and gaps, striving to plant more and harvest more.

Recent widespread rainfall in Anhui Province has been very beneficial for rushing planting. Party committees at all levels have mobilized all manpower and resources to go all out to carry out summer planting. Departments, factories, and other industries have also dispatched a large number of personnel to help rural areas rush planting. Under the slogan of "early planting, more production," more than 350,000 cadres, workers' families, urban residents, and school teachers and students in Fuyang Prefecture participated in summer planting. Leading comrades of Party committees at all levels also went deep into the grassroots, taking charge and strengthening specific leadership over summer planting, helping communes and production teams arrange labor, and doing everything possible to ensure that the planting area is completed as soon as possible. Anqing Prefecture organized women and the elderly to cut sweet potato seedlings, experienced people to plant sweet potatoes, and full labor force to cultivate land, greatly accelerating the progress of sweet potato planting.

While leading the masses in rushing to plant in summer, Party committees at all levels further implemented the policy of planting more and harvesting more, and high-yield and more harvesting, requiring continued expansion of the summer planting area on the basis of ensuring the completion of the plan, and requiring to plant as much high-yield crops as possible, such as rice and sweet potatoes. After over fulfilling the plan for transplanting mid-season rice and basically completing the summer planting task of dry land grains, Anqing Prefecture continued to mobilize more than 470,000 people to invest in the expansion campaign. According to statistics from five counties in this prefecture alone, intercropping, relay cropping, and the use of gaps have expanded the summer planting area by more than 170,000 mu. Quanjiao County in Bengbu Prefecture, after completing the rice transplanting plan, fully utilized the favorable conditions of abundant water and sufficient seedlings, and launched a heat wave of expanding rice planting by blocking water when they see it, plugging gaps when they see them, and planting rice wherever there is water, and decided to plant rice in all mountain gullies, wasteland fields, and water crossing ditches where rice can be planted.

In the rush of summer planting, various localities have launched mutual inspection of the quality of farm work among various processes, mutual supervision and acceptance, and improved the quality of summer planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou - Guangdong is seizing the opportunity before the busy summer harvest to continue to actively expand the planting of coarse grain crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, and beans. So far, about three million mu have been planted in the province.

Guangdong Province is uniquely endowed with the ability to plant coarse grains in all four seasons. Various localities have made full use of this favorable condition, doing everything possible to tap the potential of the land, and continue to expand the planting area of ​​various summer-sown coarse grains before the busy summer harvest. Shunde County, where every inch of land is precious, has now planted more than 35,000 mu of sweet potatoes, sorghum, corn, etc. In addition to continuing intercropping, relay cropping, and making full use of scattered land, they also planted sweet potatoes and tomatoes along the water's edge, based on the characteristics of many fish ponds, rivers, and dikes in the county, and planted drought-resistant sorghum, corn, beans, and pumpkins on the top of the pond base and the top of the large dike.

Leading cadres taking the lead is an important guarantee for expanding the summer planting area of ​​coarse grains. All thirteen Party committee secretaries and three hundred and eight commune and brigade cadres of the Shigou Commune in Guangsi County went deep into the grassroots and led the commune members to rush for a week, reclaiming wasteland and using scattered land to plant 15,000 mu of sweet potatoes.

At present, although various parts of Guangdong are in the midst of the busy summer harvest and preparation for late rice cultivation, the mass movement to expand the planting of coarse grains is still continuing. Shantou, Foshan and other areas that suffered typhoon and rainstorm attacks in mid-June have an even higher enthusiasm for expanding planting. In the past ten days, Shantou area has planted about 100,000 mu of coarse grain crops and vegetables. (Attached picture)

    安徽力争超额完成夏播计划
    广东在夏收大忙前抓紧增种杂粮
    据新华社合肥电　安徽各地抓紧时间抢栽抢种，力争尽快地完成和超额完成夏种计划。到目前止，全省大部分地区已完成夏种计划，还没有完成计划的县和人民公社正在加快夏种进度，已经超额完成计划的安庆专区宿松、太湖等县正向荒滩湖地和空隙地进军，力争种得多、收得多。
    安徽省最近普遍降雨，对抢栽抢种十分有利。各级党委都调动一切人力、物力，全力以赴地突击夏种。机关、工厂等各行各业也抽调大批人力，帮助农村抢栽抢种。阜阳专区在“早下种、多增产”的口号下，参加夏种的机关干部、职工家属、城镇居民、学校师生就有三十五万多人。各级党委负责人也都深入基层，包干负责，加强对夏种的具体领导，帮助公社、生产队安排劳力，千方百计地保证播种面积尽快完成。安庆专区组织妇女、老年人剪山芋苗，有经验的人栽山芋，整劳动力耕地，大大加快了山芋栽种进度。
    各级党委在领导群众突击夏种时，进一步地贯彻了多种多收，高产多收的方针，要求在保证完成计划的基础上继续扩大夏种面积，并且要求尽量多种水稻、山芋等高产作物。安庆专区在超额完成中稻栽播计划和基本完成旱粮夏种任务之后，仍继续出动四十七万多人，投入扩种运动。这个专区仅据五个县的统计，就已间种、套种和利用空隙地扩大夏种面积十七万多亩。蚌埠专区的全椒县，在完成水稻栽插计划后，又充分利用水多、苗足的有利条件，掀起见水就拦、有缺就堵、有水必栽的扩种水稻热潮，决定把所有山沟荒田、过水沟等能栽水稻的地方全部种上水稻。
    各地在突击夏种中，发动各个工序之间互相检查农活质量，互相监督和验收，提高了夏种的质量。
    据新华社广州电　广东各地正在抓紧夏收大忙之前的时机，继续积极扩种番薯、玉米、高粱、豆类等杂粮作物。到现在，全省已经种了三百万亩左右。
    广东省得天独厚，四季可种杂粮。各地充分利用这个有利条件，千方百计挖掘土地潜力，在夏收大忙之前继续扩大各种夏种杂粮的种植面积。尺土寸金的顺德县，现已种下番薯、高粱、玉米等三万五千多亩。他们除了继续套种、间种和充分利用零星土地外，还根据本县渔塘、河涌、堤围多的特点，沿水边种植番薯、番茄，在塘基顶和大围顶种植耐旱的高粱、玉米、豆类和南瓜等。
    领导上阵、干部带头，是扩大夏种杂粮面积的重要保证。广四县石狗公社十三个党委书记和三百零八个公社、大队干部全部深入基层，领导社员突击一周，就开荒和利用零星土地种下番薯一万五千亩。
    目前，广东各地虽然处在夏收和晚造备耕大忙期间，扩种杂粮作物的群众运动仍在继续开展。6月中旬遭受台风、暴雨袭击的汕头、佛山等地区，扩种的积极性更高。汕头地区近十天来已种下杂粮作物和蔬菜十万亩左右。（附图片）
