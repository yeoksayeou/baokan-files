　　Learning from Shang Yishun's Diligent and Frugal Work Style
    The news item "Comrade Shang Yishun Diligently and Frugally Works Ten Years as One Day," published in the People's Daily on June 14th, is a vivid, concrete, and inspiring record of life and thought in the era of the Great Leap Forward; it is also a concise and powerful living textbook of communist education.

    These admirable comrades are, as Chairman Mao said: "... a noble person... a person beneficial to the people." They are the true masters of our country, our era, and good cadres who wholeheartedly serve the Party.

    At present, I am still far from Comrade Shang Yishun's ideological qualities and exemplary actions. However, I have a firm heart. I want to emulate Comrade Shang Yishun, be a Shang Yishun-style person, establish the glorious banner of communist qualities and communist spirit from the depths of my soul, and be a diligent servant of the people.

　　学习商宜顺的克勤克俭作风
    6月14日人民日报刊登的“商宜顺同志克勤克俭十年如一日”的新闻，是一篇生动、具体、激动人心的大跃进年代里的生活思想的实录；也是一篇简炼、有力的共产主义教育的活课本。
    这些可敬爱的同志，正如毛主席所说：“……是一个高尚的人……一个有益于人民的人。”他们是我们国家、是我们时代的真正的主人、是全心全意为党效忠的好干部。
    现在，我离商宜顺同志的思想品质和模范行动虽然差得很远。但是，我有一颗坚决的心，我要向商宜顺同志看齐，作一个商宜顺式的人，从灵魂的最深处树起共产主义品质、共产主义精神这面光辉的大旗，作一个勤奋的人民的勤务员。
