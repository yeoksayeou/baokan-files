    Going Deep Beside the Threshing Machine
    Comrade Chen Peixiang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Qinghe Farm in Nanzhang, Hubei, went deep beside a Soviet-style threshing machine during the wheat harvest and worked with technicians and workers to study how to improve the efficiency of threshing. When he found that the pulley on the threshing machine was larger than the transmission wheel on the diesel engine, resulting in a low speed and only 10,000 jin of wheat threshed in twelve hours, he immediately raised the issue and discussed it with the technicians and workers.

    After research and appraisal, they reduced the size of the driving wheel on the threshing machine from nine inches in diameter to six inches. This increased the speed, allowing 15,000 jin of wheat to be threshed in twelve hours, an increase in efficiency of 50% compared to the original. Now all six Soviet-style threshing machines in the farm have been modified in this way, greatly improving the efficiency of threshing.

    深入到脱粒机旁
    湖北南漳清河农场党支部书记陈培湘同志，在抢打小麦中深入到一台苏式脱粒机旁，和技术员、工人一起研究提高脱粒工效。当他发现脱粒机上的皮带轮比柴油机上的传动轮大，转速低，十二小时只能脱粒一万斤。于是他就马上把这个问题提出来和技术员、工人们商量。
    经过研究鉴定，就将脱粒机上的动轮改小，由原来直径九寸改小到六寸，这样转速提高了，十二小时可脱粒一万五千斤，比原来工效提高了50％。现在全场六部苏式脱粒机都这样改了，脱粒工效大大提高。
