Xi'an, July 3 (From Our Own Correspondent) The Xi'an No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, proceeding from the overall interests of socialist construction and establishing a global perspective, has changed from the mixed construction method based on construction sites to a streamlined construction method organized by area, with foundation, main body, and finishing work carried out simultaneously in a crisscross pattern. This has effectively changed the past situation where foundation work could not keep up with the requirements of the main body work, and finishing work dragged on for too long, effectively ensuring that new buildings are delivered for use on schedule.

After studying and summarizing the experience of three-line construction, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this is a very important experience. The Provincial Party Committee has decided to widely promote this advanced experience in construction and installation enterprises throughout the province.

In the past, the Xi'an No. 3 Construction Engineering Company had long-standing problems of neglecting preparation, rushing the main body, and dragging out the finishing work; in the allocation of tasks, one-sided emphasis was placed on output value plans. In particular, as a result of emphasizing output value, everyone rushed to do the main body work, which had a higher output value, while the foundation work, which was labor-intensive and had a lower output value, was not grasped tightly. Therefore, it often happened that the main body of the previous batch of construction projects had been completed, but the foundation of the next batch of projects had not yet been done well, and the main body work could not continue, resulting in wasted labor. Some construction sites, in order to avoid wasted labor, transferred technical workers from the main body work to dig earthwork, resulting in unreasonable use of technical forces; some construction sites, in order to expedite the main body work, disrupted the original plan, first carried out projects with small earthwork, and left some key projects with large earthwork that were originally planned to be started behind, affecting the timely commissioning of key projects; also some construction sites, in order to rush the main body work, carried out the main body work before the foundation work was completed, which often affected the quality of the project; or a new project was started before a project was completed, which lengthened the battle line and dispersed the construction forces, resulting in the occupation of a lot of building materials and the expenditure of a lot of labor, but the production units could not be delivered for use on time.

This year, the company has to complete a construction task that is double that of last year without increasing the number of personnel, and it is also required to complete it on schedule, without dragging its feet, and deliver it for production use in a timely manner. To this end, when deploying this year's construction tasks, the company adopted the method of issuing foundation, main body, and finishing tasks separately. However, because the problems were not solved ideologically and in terms of construction organization at that time, the finishing work was still not guaranteed when it was implemented. At the same time, the old production order was broken through in the technical innovation movement, and the original construction organization was no longer adapted to the new situation after the complete set of machinery. The 232 kinds and 4,800 pieces of advanced machinery created by the company's employees were matched into 136 dragons, and the work efficiency increased several times. However, because the one-stop mixed construction method based on construction sites was adopted, the personnel were not specialized and the machinery was not fixed, the complete set of machinery could not often be used completely; even if it was used, it could not exert the effectiveness of the complete set of machinery because the workload of each type of work was small. This also affected the enthusiasm of employees to carry out technical revolution.

In order to completely change this situation, the company's Party committee, while strengthening the ideological education of employees, mobilized the masses to carry out major reforms in production organization and construction organization. As a result, a set of rapid construction methods that broke the boundaries of construction sites, divided the entire company into three construction management areas, and then formed three assembly lines of foundation, main body, and finishing work with the management area as the unit, appeared.

As soon as the new construction method appeared, it quickly showed its superiority. The main body project of the combined workshop and foundry workshop of the Xi'an Mining Machinery Factory was completed in October 1959. Although the unfinished finishing work was included in the plan every month, the construction unit always emphasized that it could not spare any strength in order to rush the main body project with high output value, and it was not completed until March of this year. After the company implemented the three-line construction in April, the company's finishing work team transferred more than 180 people to carry out finishing work, and as a result, the finishing work of these two workshops was completed quickly.

Because the boundary of construction sites was broken after the implementation of three-line construction, each management area concentrated the construction projects of several construction sites in the past, and the three teams of foundation, main body, and finishing work carried out large-scale assembly line operation within the scope of the management area, so that the three-line production was carried out continuously, one line promoted another, one link was linked to another, and the phenomenon of wasted labor caused by the small scope of construction sites and unbalanced production in the past was avoided, and the quality of the project was guaranteed.

In the process of promoting three-line construction, the company also comprehensively adjusted the labor organization according to the needs of balanced production of the three lines of foundation, main body, and finishing work. The labor force of each professional team is a combination of large comprehensive and small professional, which is both professional-oriented and can be flexibly mobilized according to the needs of construction. This not only overcomes the shortcomings of mixed construction based on construction sites that cannot guarantee balanced production, but also avoids the shortcomings of pure specialization that the construction department has already criticized, such as "shaving the head but not shaving the beard." Therefore, the construction progress has been greatly accelerated. The workload completed in April increased by 12% compared with March, and the workload in May increased by 8.5% compared with April. By June 20, 50% of the annual national plan has been completed. The completed area of the company in May was 46% more than the sum of January and March, and more than twice the completed area in April. The planned completed area in June was 11% more than the sum of the completed area in the first five months of this year.

The implementation of three-line construction has also greatly promoted technical innovation and technical revolution. In the past, personnel were not specialized and machinery was not fixed, and some workers even changed tasks several times a day. After the implementation of three-line construction, people are specialized, things are specialized, and machinery is specialized. This makes it easier for workers to be familiar with the performance of the machinery, improve operating efficiency, and strengthen the maintenance of the machinery. After the implementation of three-line construction, the work efficiency of all types of work in the company has generally increased by one to three times.

    树立全局观点　从整体利益出发，基础、主体、收尾交叉流水作业
    陕西推行“三线施工”加快工程进度
    本报西安3日电　西安市第三建筑工程公司从社会主义建设的整体利益出发，树立全局观点，改以工地为单位的混合施工方法，为按区域组织基础、主体、收尾三线同时交叉进行的流水施工方法，从而改变了过去基础工程赶不上主体工程的要求，收尾工程拖得过长的现象，有效地保证了新建筑如期交付使用。
    中共陕西省委在研究和总结了三线施工的经验以后，认为这是一项很重要的经验。省委已决定在全省建筑安装企业中普遍推广这项先进经验。
    西安市第三建筑工程公司过去长期存在着轻准备、抢主体、拖收尾的现象；在布置任务当中，又片面强调产值计划。特别是强调产值的结果，大家都抢着作产值较大的主体工程，而对费工大、产值较低的基础工程就抓得不紧。因此，常常出现前一批建设项目的主体工程已经完工，后一批工程的基础还没有作好，主体工程不能继续进行，发生窝工现象。有些工地为了避免窝工，就抽调主体工程的技术工人挖土方，造成技术力量使用上的不合理；有些工地为了促使主体工程赶快上去，打乱原来的计划，先去进行土方量小的工程，而把原计划开工的一些土方量较大的重点工程留在后边，影响重点工程按期投入生产；还有些工地为了抢作主体工程，在基础工程没有完成以前就进行主体工程，往往影响工程质量；或者一个工程未结束又开始一个新工程，使战线越拉越长，施工力量分散，结果占用很多建筑材料，花费了很多劳动力，但是不能按期交付生产单位使用。
    今年，这个公司在人员不增加的情况下，要完成比去年增加一倍的施工任务，而且要求按期完成，不拖尾巴，及时交付生产使用。为此，这个公司在部署今年的建筑任务时，曾采取分别下达基础、主体、收尾任务的办法。但是，由于当时没有从思想上和施工组织上解决问题，执行起来，收尾工程仍然得不到保证。同时，技术革新运动中旧的生产秩序被突破，原来的施工组织与机具配套成龙后的新情况也不相适应。这个公司职工创造的二百三十二种、四千八百多件先进机具，配成一百三十六条龙以后，工效成倍增长。但是因为采用了工地为单位的一揽子混合施工，人员不专业、机具不固定，成龙的机具往往不能完整的经常使用；即使使用，也因各个工种的工程量小，发挥不了成套机具的效力。这样，也影响了职工开展技术革命的积极性。
    为了彻底改变这种状况，公司党委在加强职工思想教育的同时，发动群众大闹生产组织和施工组织的改革。于是，一套打破工地界限，将全公司分为三个施工管区，再以管区为单位把基础、主体、收尾组成三条流水线的快速施工方法就出现了。
    新的施工方法一出现，很快就显示出它的优越性。西安矿山机械厂的联合车间和铸工车间，1959年10月份就完成了主体工程，未完成的收尾工程虽然月月编到计划里去，但施工单位为了抢产值高的主体工程，总是强调抽不出力量，直拖到今年3月份还没有收尾。4月份这个公司实行了三线施工后，公司扫尾大队抽调了一百八十多人突击扫尾，结果，这两个车间的收尾工程很快就完成了。
    由于实行三线施工后打破了工地界限，每个管区都集中了过去几个工地的建设项目，基础、主体、收尾三个大队在管区范围内实行大流水作业，使三线生产连续进行，一线促一线，一环扣一环，避免了过去由于工地范围小、生产不均衡而产生的窝工现象，并且保证了工程质量。
    这个公司在推行三线施工过程中，还按照基础、主体、收尾三线均衡生产的需要，全面调整了劳动组织。每个专业大队的劳动力都是实行大综合，小专业，既以专业为主，又可以根据施工需要灵活调动，既克服了以工地为单位混合施工不能保证均衡生产的毛病，也避免了过去建筑部门已经批判过的那种“剃头不管刮胡子”的单纯专业化的缺点。因此，大大加快了施工进度。4月份完成的工作量比3月份增加了12％，5月份又比4月份增长8.5％，至6月20日，已完成全年国家计划的50％。这个公司5月份的竣工面积比1月份和3月份的总和还多46％，比4月份竣工面积多两倍以上，6月份计划竣工面积比今年前五个月竣工面积的总和还多11％。
    实行三线施工还大大促进了技术革新和技术革命。过去人员不专、机具不固定，有的工人甚至一天变更几次任务。实行三线施工后，人专、事专、机具专，这样就便于工人熟悉机械性能，提高操作效率，加强对机具的保养和维修。实现三线施工后全公司各工种的工效普遍提高一倍至三倍。
