    Planned Grain Consumption Leads to a Good Life
    ——Introduction to the Yadi Xinzhuang Dining Hall of the Fenghuo Commune in Qianxian, Shaanxi
    Jing Ming Yuan Zong Jun Xiang
    Comrade Wang Guanglu, the administrator of the Yadi Xinzhuang dining hall of the Fenghuo Commune in Qianxian, Shaanxi, and a Communist Party member, wholeheartedly serves the dining hall. For three years, he has adhered to the Party's stance, relied on the masses, and overcome countless difficulties to establish a good dining hall – one that allows commune members to eat their fill, eat well, and save grain.

    The Revelation of the Provincial Party Secretary
    In June 1959, when the summer harvest had just begun, Zhang Desheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, came to Yadi Xinzhuang to inspect work. While eating with the commune members, Secretary Zhang praised the village's dining hall for being well-run. Then, he asked the administrator, Wang Guanglu: "Will eating like this exceed the grain ration?" "It may exceed a little." "How much will it exceed?" "It exceeded more than 300 jin in half a month." Secretary Zhang told him: overconsumption of grain will affect the consolidation of the dining hall. We must find ways to eat our fill, eat well, and save grain... Secretary Zhang's words took deep root in Comrade Wang Guanglu's mind.
    After seeing Secretary Zhang off, Comrade Guanglu went into the kitchen and worked with the cooks to improve the meals, find and plug all loopholes in grain waste, and formulate detailed plans for saving grain. Poor and lower-middle peasants supported this wholeheartedly, saying that this was the way to manage a household. Some wealthy peasants, however, strongly opposed this, saying that the dining hall was deducting from people's rations and even scolded Guanglu for not understanding human feelings. These two completely different reactions reminded Wang Guanglu, who came from a poor peasant background, of many past events: Before liberation, whenever wheat was harvested, the landlords and rich peasants in the village would feast on the large amounts of grain they obtained through lending and hiring labor, while the poor peasants would carefully budget their grain. Thinking of this, Guanglu's determination to save grain became even stronger.
    By the end of August, on the basis of ensuring that commune members ate their fill and ate well, the dining hall made up for the deficit of more than 980 jin of grain that had been overconsumed before June, and also saved 400 jin. By the end of the year, a total of more than 3,000 jin was saved. This spring, some commune members who did not eat in the dining hall ran out of their staple grain, while the dining hall was still serving wheat steamed buns and white noodles for every meal. Commune members who had withdrawn from the dining hall automatically returned, and four households who had never entered the dining hall also joined.

    Relying on the Masses to Resist Erroneous Trends
    In the autumn of 1959, the Yadi Xinzhuang dining hall was already a well-known good dining hall in the county. However, at this time, three anonymous big-character posters appeared at the entrance of the dining hall, saying that the dining hall had "three wastes" and that "running the dining hall has benefited the administrator and cooks" and so on. Seeing this made people very angry. At this time, the Party branch secretary of the brigade reminded Wang Guanglu: This is not surprising. The dining hall is the heart of the people's commune, and those who oppose the commune will first oppose the dining hall and oppose the management personnel. This is just a small minority, why don't you ask the basic masses... Guanglu followed the branch secretary's advice and visited some poor and lower-middle peasants, soliciting their opinions and views on the dining hall. When the poor old lady Zhang Yulian heard about the attack on the dining hall, she angrily patted her chest and said: "The dining hall is my lifeline. Whoever wants to withdraw can withdraw, but my family will eat in the dining hall." A debate on whether or not to have a dining hall quickly unfolded. Through the debate, people's eyes were sharpened, and their class consciousness was raised, uniting everyone around the dining hall and Wang Guanglu.
    In order to continue to consolidate and improve the dining hall, Wang Guanglu and the cooks discussed and decided to establish a family-based production system. They started with raising pigs. In order to do this well, Guanglu and the cooks sacrificed their rest time, cut grass, picked leaves, and found substitute feed, and finally managed to raise the pigs. Unexpectedly, misfortunes happened one after another: In a few days, the pigs contracted an epidemic and died, leaving only one. According to Guanglu's plan: the sow would give birth to piglets, the piglets would grow into large pigs, and in half a year there would be a large group. After fulfilling the state plan, one pig would be slaughtered every month or two to improve the lives of the commune members. Now that the pigs were dead, the ideal had failed. Guanglu was a tenacious person. He was over forty years old and had never been so sad before, but at this time he was so sad that he almost cried.
    The death of the pigs was a great loss. The poor and lower-middle peasants supported Guanglu again: "Guanglu: Pigs are raised by people. If six pigs died, we will raise twelve more." This was the advice of the poor peasant Zhang Yulian. "Guanglu: Don't worry about not having money. As long as you speak up, you can have as much as you want..." With the support of the masses, by the end of November, there were twenty-one pigs in the dining hall's pigsty again.

    Reforming Cooking Utensils to Save Labor
    The Yadi Xinzhuang dining hall was getting better and better, but there was only one drawback: there were many cooking processes, the work was heavy, and too much labor was occupied. More than one hundred people were eating, and there were seven or eight cooks making meals. How could this work? Wang Guanglu took on the task of reforming cooking utensils again. He took a hand-cranked blower that the commune had used for steelmaking and took it to a carpentry shop to be modified, but it was not successful. This caused some people to comment again: People at the carpentry shop "Upper Eight Immortals" couldn't modify it, so what do you, an ignorant "Lower Eight Immortals," think you can do? Guanglu was very angry when he heard this. He defiantly said: A road is made by people walking it. As long as we use our brains and everyone comes up with ideas, the "Lower Eight Immortals" can beat the "Upper Eight Immortals."
    Although that's what he said, there were indeed many difficulties. Many equipment were needed to modify the blower, but the team had almost none. Guanglu brought the only ball bearings from his home, and commune member Du Qingyun also brought an iron shaft. The two of them worked all night, studying and improving one by one. After modifying, they tested it, and after testing, they modified it again. By the fourth test, the wind was blowing vigorously.
    The success of the foot-operated blower opened people's eyes. Then, a movement in which everyone contributed ideas and suggestions for the reform of cooking utensils began. In less than a month, all fourteen processes, from noodle pressing, vegetable cutting, and water use, were semi-automated. The number of people eating in the dining hall increased to more than two hundred, but there were only four cooks and management personnel.

    Planned Grain Consumption and Economical Grain Use
    The summer harvest is over, and grain rations have been distributed to the dining hall. How can we better arrange the lives of the masses? The responsibility on the shoulders of the administrator is even heavier. As soon as the wheat was harvested, Guanglu made arrangements for this year's grain based on the spirit of saving grain and planned grain consumption: the summer grain must connect with the autumn grain, and it must also be kept until the wheat harvest next year. At this time, some wealthy peasants were again displaying the mentality of only caring about today and not caring about tomorrow, relying on the state for grain. Guanglu immediately led the commune members in criticizing this incorrect thinking, making everyone realize that saving grain must start from the top of the granary. After the ideological problem was solved, he let the masses discuss how to arrange future grain consumption according to the grain ration standards, so as to eat their fill, eat well, and save grain. During the discussion, the masses offered suggestions and ideas, and found many good ways to save grain. Some people said: As long as we adjust it well and match the dishes, we can save grain and improve our lives. Based on the opinions of the masses, he had them eat better and more when the work was heavy, and save more when the farm work was slightly idle. One day, the dining hall ate a meal of dry noodles, using 20 jin more grain. On a cloudy day when the work was idle, the dining hall ate a hot and harmonious pot of noodles, saving 45 jin of grain. The commune members were all satisfied and said: The combination of dry and wet is good, eating well and saving grain. Some said: Calculate every day, calculate the meals, and everyone calculates, so we know what's going on.
    Guanglu knew that in order to further improve the lives of the commune members, it was necessary to vigorously develop family-based production to ensure that the commune members had enough vegetables and non-staple foods. After the summer harvest, in addition to planting 15 mu of vegetable fields well, he also intercropped 30 mu of radishes, cabbage, and other vegetables in the corn and cotton fields. According to the calculations, 60,000 jin of vegetables can be harvested this year. All year round, the commune members can eat nutritious fresh vegetables, and they can also save grain. The dining hall's livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, and chickens, in addition to meeting the state's purchase tasks, slaughter an average of one pig or sheep every two months to adjust the lives of the commune members.
    Just as Guanglu had arranged the plan properly, he went back into the kitchen again. In a few days, he and the cooks cooperated to use the method of "skillfully making staple food, combining dry and wet, mixing grain and vegetables, and adjusting staple and non-staple foods" to make fifty or sixty kinds of delicious and grain-saving meals. They also adopted long-term plans and short-term arrangements, ordering a meal plan every seven days and making the meals that the commune members liked to eat the most.

    计划用粮生活好
    ——陕西烽火公社崖底新庄食堂介绍
    景铭  袁宗  俊祥
    陕西乾县烽火公社崖底新庄食堂管理员、共产党员王广禄同志，一片丹心为食堂。他，三年如一日，坚持党的立场，依靠群众，克服了数不清的困难，办起了一个好食堂——让社员吃的饱，吃的好，又省粮。省委书记的启示
    1959年6月，夏收刚开始的时候，省委第一书记张德生同志到崖底新庄检查工作，张书记和社员们一起吃饭中，夸奖了这个庄的食堂办得好，接着问管理员王广禄：“这样吃会不会超过口粮指标？”“能超一些。”“超多少呢？”“半月超了三百多斤。”张书记告诉他说：粮食超吃会影响食堂的巩固，要想办法做到吃饱、吃好，又省粮……。张书记的话深深地在王广禄同志的思想上扎了根。
    广禄同志送走了张书记，就钻进厨房，和炊事员一起研究改进饭菜，寻找和堵塞一切浪费粮食的漏洞，订出了详细的节约用粮计划。贫农、下中农双手拥护，说这才像个过日子的样子。一些富裕农民却极力反对这样做，说什么食堂克扣人，甚至骂广禄不懂人情。两种截然不同的表现，使贫农出身的王广禄想起了很多往事：解放前，每当麦子打下来，村里的地主、富农凭着放账、雇工得来的大堆粮食大吃大喝，贫农却精打细算地吃粮。想到这里，广禄节约用粮的意志更坚决了。
    到8月底，食堂在确保社员吃饱、吃好的基础上，把6月份以前超吃的九百八十多斤粮食的亏空补齐了，还节约了四百斤；到年底，一共节约了三千多斤。今年春上，没在食堂吃饭的一些社员把主粮吃光了，食堂里上顿下顿吃的还是麦面蒸馍、白面条。退出食堂的社员自动回来了，从来没入食堂的四户社员也进了食堂。
    依靠群众顶住歪风
    1959年秋季，崖底新庄食堂已经是全县知名的好食堂了。谁知，就在这时，食堂门口出现了三张匿名的大字报，说什么食堂有“三浪费”，“办食堂红火了管理员、炊事员”等等。看了很令人生气。这时，大队党支部书记提醒王广禄：这不奇怪，食堂是人民公社的心脏，反对公社的人首先会反对食堂，反对管理人员。这只是极少数，不信你去问问基本群众……。广禄按照支书的意见，访问了一些贫农和下中农，征求他们对食堂的意见和看法。贫农老太太张玉莲听说有人攻击食堂的事，气得拍着自己的胸膛说：“食堂是我的命根子，谁要退谁退，反正我家要在食堂吃饭。”一场要不要食堂的辩论迅速展开了。经过辩论，擦亮了人们的眼睛，提高了阶级觉悟；把大家团结在食堂和王广禄的周围。
    为了把食堂继续巩固、提高，王广禄和炊事员们商量，决定建立家底生产。他们首先从养猪下手。为了把这件事办好，广禄和炊事员牺牲了休息时间，割青草，摘树叶，找代饲料，好容易把猪养大。不料，不幸的事接二连三地发生了：不几天，猪得了疫病，死得只剩下一头了。按照广禄的想法：母猪生小猪，小猪长大猪，半年后就是一大群，完成了国家计划，每隔一月两月杀上一头，好叫社员改善改善生活。如今猪死了，理想落了空。广禄是个顽强的人，他活了四十多岁，没有怎么伤心过，这时却难过得差点哭出声来。
    猪的死亡，是个很大损失。贫农、下中农又给广禄撑腰了：“广禄：猪是人养的，死了六头，咱再养十二头。”这是贫农张玉莲的劝告。“广禄：不要耽心没钱，只要你搭声，要多少，有多少……。”在群众的支持下，到11月底，食堂猪圈里又有了二十一头猪。
    改革炊具节省劳力
    崖底新庄食堂越办越好，只有一点美中不足：炊事工序多，活重，占用劳力过多。一百多人吃饭，做饭的炊事员就有七、八个。这怎么能行？王广禄又把改革炊具的担子担了起来。他把公社给的一架炼钢铁用过的手摇鼓风机，拿到木器铺改装，但没有成功。这又引起一些人的议论：人家木器铺“上八仙”都没改成，你那个一窍不通的“下八仙”还想咋？广禄听了很生气，他赌气说：路是人走出来的，只要动脑子，大家想办法，“下八仙”也能胜过“上八仙”。
    话虽然这么说，困难也确实不少。改装鼓风机需要很多器材，队里几乎没有一件，广禄就把自己家里仅有的滚珠拿了来，社员杜清云也拿来了铁轴。他俩叮叮当当干了个通宵，一样一样研究，一件一件改进，改了试，试了改，到第四次试验时，风就呼呼地吹起来了。
    脚踏鼓风机改装成功，打开了人们的眼界。接着一个人人为炊具改革献策、献计运动开始了，不到一月，从压面、切菜、用水等十四道工序，全部实现了半自动化。在食堂吃饭的人，增加到二百多人，但炊事、管理人员只有四个。
    计划用粮节约用粮
    夏收结束了，口粮分配到了食堂，如何更好地安排好群众生活呢？落在管理员肩上的责任更重了。麦子刚打下来，广禄就根据节约用粮、计划用粮的精神，对今年的粮食作了安排：夏粮要接住秋粮，还要留到明年麦收下来。这时又有一些富裕农民表现只管今天，不管明天，吃完粮食靠国家的思想。广禄马上领导社员批判了这种不正确的思想，使大家认识到节约粮要从囤顶做起。思想问题解决后，他便让群众讨论如何按口粮标准安排今后的用粮，做到吃饱吃好又节约。讨论中，群众出谋献计，找出许多节约用粮的好办法。有人说：只要调剂好，搭配谄，既能省粮，生活也改善了。他就根据群众的意见，活重时，吃好些，多吃些；农活稍闲时，节约一些。有一天，食堂吃了一顿干面，多用粮二十斤，在一个阴天活闲时，食堂吃了一顿热热和和的连锅面，就省出四十五斤粮，社员都满意地说：干稀搭配好，吃好又省粮。有的说：逐日核算，算了吃饭，人人算账，心里亮堂。
    广禄知道，要进一步改善社员生活，一定要大力开展家底生产，保证社员吃到足够的蔬菜和副食品。夏收后，他除了种好十五亩菜地，还在玉米、棉花地里套种萝卜、白菜等三十亩，计算一下，今年可收六万斤蔬菜，四时八节，社员都能吃到富有营养的新鲜蔬菜，也能节省粮食。食堂的猪、羊、鸡等家畜家禽，除满足国家收购任务，平均两月杀一头猪或羊，调剂社员生活。
    广禄刚把计划安排妥贴，又钻进灶房，不几天，就和炊事员合作，用“主粮巧做，干稀搭配，粮菜混合，主副调剂”的办法，做出了五、六十种十分可口又省粮的好饭。还采取长计划、短安排，每七天订一次饭谱，多做社员最喜爱吃的饭。
