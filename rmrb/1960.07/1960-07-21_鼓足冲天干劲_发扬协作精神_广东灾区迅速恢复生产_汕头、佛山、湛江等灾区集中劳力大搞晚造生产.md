Guangzhou, July 20th (By our own correspondent) - The people in the disaster areas of Guangdong are rapidly restoring production. The repair of river embankments and dikes has been basically completed, and a surge in late rice crop production has swept across various locations.

In June, Guangdong Province was hit by wind and flood disasters twice in succession. The first time, a strong typhoon struck the Shantou and Foshan regions, causing damage to thirty-two counties and cities. The second time, a strong typhoon made landfall in Huazhou County in the Zhanjiang region, also impacting the two thousand kilometers of coastline in the Zhanjiang region.

The people in the disaster areas, under the strong leadership of the Party, after overcoming the storms and floods, have brought out even greater enthusiasm than they showed in resisting the wind and floods, throwing themselves into the work of restoring production and rebuilding their homes. The entire commune members of Jiangdong Commune in Chao'an County, which suffered the largest flood disaster in history, launched a comprehensive production restoration movement with the spirit of “higher labor attendance than before the disaster, higher labor enthusiasm than before the disaster, higher work efficiency than before the disaster, and higher work quality than before the disaster.” For more than half a month after the disaster, more than 14,000 people were mobilized every day to eliminate the traces of the disaster. As of July 6th, all eleven dangerous sections and small dike breaches of the commune's dikes had been completely repaired, and they had also been heightened and reinforced. More than 5,200 mu of the more than 5,700 mu of farmland flooded in the commune have been replanted with sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grain crops. All eighteen teams in the commune which suffered minor and moderate damage have resumed production, and the thirteen severely damaged teams have basically eliminated the traces of the disaster. Now, before and behind the villages, there is a new scene of lush greenery everywhere. After the typhoon and rain stopped, the Shitou Brigade of Lian'an Commune in Haifeng County went all out to carry out the work of restoring production and rebuilding their homes. It only took eleven days to build two hundred and thirty-five houses, so that all commune members were able to live in peace, and the public canteens were quickly restored, properly arranging the lives of the commune members.

This work of restoring production and rebuilding homes was carried out under the direct leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. When the flood began to recede, the Provincial Committee made comprehensive arrangements for all localities to quickly restore production and do a good job in disaster relief, and promptly allocated large quantities of materials and relief funds to support the people in the disaster areas. Like the fight against floods and rescue efforts, cadres at all levels stood on the front lines of restoring production and rebuilding their homes. The first secretaries of the county committees and cadres at all levels in the disaster-stricken counties throughout the province went deep into the disaster areas, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, participating in and leading the repair of dikes, and rushing to harvest and plant crops.

In the restoration of production in the disaster areas, the spirit of collaboration has been greatly promoted. Non-disaster areas support disaster areas, lightly damaged areas support severely damaged areas, and communes and teams support each other, so that various difficulties can be quickly overcome. Twenty-seven lightly affected teams in Huacheng Commune in Wuhua County mobilized more than 3,000 people every day to support the heavily affected teams, and they also took out more than 10,000 catties of sweet potato seedlings and a large amount of fuel to support the heavily affected teams in resuming work and arranging their lives.

The vast number of cadres and masses in the disaster-stricken areas of the province, with the lofty ambition of "man will conquer nature," united and fought hard against the extraordinary natural disasters, creating a miracle of high-speed production restoration and home rebuilding. The Shantou and Foshan regions immediately repaired more than 58,000 houses after the disaster, and the disaster-stricken areas in the Zhanjiang region also rushed to repair a number of houses after the wind and rain, so that the people in the disaster areas were properly arranged for clothing, food, and housing. The river dikes and water conservancy projects destroyed by floods in the disaster areas of the province have been basically repaired, and the ripening rice blown down by the wind has also been harvested. After the accumulated water in the farmland in various places was drained, sweet potatoes, corn, millet and other early-maturing miscellaneous grain crops were immediately planted. In Shantou and Foshan regions alone, more than 1.2 million mu were planted after the disaster. At present, the people in the disaster areas of Shantou, Foshan, Zhanjiang and other places have highly concentrated their labor force on the front line of agricultural production, and are making a big effort to produce late rice crops.

    鼓足冲天干劲  发扬协作精神
    广东灾区迅速恢复生产
    汕头、佛山、湛江等灾区集中劳力大搞晚造生产
    本报广州20日电  广东灾区人民正在迅速恢复生产，江河堤围的修复工作已基本完成，各地掀起了晚造生产热潮。
    6月间，广东省曾经先后两次受到风洪灾害的侵袭。第一次，强台风袭击汕头、佛山专区，使三十二个县市遭受其害。第二次，强台风在湛江专区的化州县登陆，也使湛江专区二千公里的沿海地区遭受袭击。
    受灾地区人民，在党的坚强领导下，战胜暴风和洪水之后，拿出比抗风抗洪更大的干劲，投入恢复生产和重建家园的工作。曾经遭受到历史上最大一次洪水灾害的潮安县江东公社全体社员以“出勤劳动力超灾前，劳动干劲超灾前，工作效率超灾前，工作质量超灾前”的行动，掀起了一个声势猛、速度快、规模大的全面恢复生产运动。灾后半个多月来，每天都出动一万四千多人投入消灭灾痕的战斗。到7月6日止，全社十一处堤围险段和小堤缺口已全部修复，并且加高加固了。全社受浸的五千七百多亩农田，已有五千二百多亩抢种上了甘薯和其他杂粮作物。全社十八个轻灾队和中灾队已恢复生产，十三个重灾队基本消灭了灾痕。现在，村前村后皆是一片郁郁葱葱、遍地皆绿的新景象。海丰县联安公社石塘大队在暴风雨停止后，就全力开展了恢复生产和重建家园的工作。只花了十一天的工夫便修建了二百三十五间房子，使全体社员都得到安居，公共食堂也迅速恢复起来，妥善地安排了社员的生活。
    这次恢复生产、重建家园的工作，是在中共广东省委的直接领导下进行的。当洪水开始下降时，省委便全面布置各地迅速恢复生产和做好救灾工作，并且及时拨出大批物资和救济款，支援灾区人民。各级干部像抗洪抢险时那样，这次又站在恢复生产、重建家园的最前线，全省灾区各县的县委第一书记和各级干部都深入到灾区和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加和领导抢修堤围，抢收抢种。
    在灾区恢复生产中，大大发扬协作精神。非灾区支援灾区，轻灾区支援重灾区，社与社、队与队互相支援，使各种困难迅速克服。五华县华城公社二十七个轻灾队每天都出动三千多人去支援重灾队，他们还拿出一万多斤薯苗和大批燃料支援重灾队恢复工作和安排生活。
    全省受灾地区的广大干部和群众抱着“人定胜天”的雄心壮志，团结一致，奋力抗击特大自然灾害，创造了高速度恢复生产、重建家园的奇迹。汕头、佛山专区在灾后立即抢修了五万八千多间房屋，湛江专区受灾地区也在风雨过后抢修了一批房屋，使灾区人民的衣、食、住问题都得到妥善安排。全省灾区被洪水冲毁的江河堤围和水利工程已基本修好，被风刮倒的已黄熟的水稻也都抢收回来了。各地农田积水排干后，立即抢种番薯、玉米、粟类等早熟杂粮作物。仅汕头、佛山两专区在灾后就抢种了一百二十多万亩。目前，汕头、佛山、湛江等地灾区人民，都把劳动力高度地集中到农业生产第一线上，大闹晚造生产。
