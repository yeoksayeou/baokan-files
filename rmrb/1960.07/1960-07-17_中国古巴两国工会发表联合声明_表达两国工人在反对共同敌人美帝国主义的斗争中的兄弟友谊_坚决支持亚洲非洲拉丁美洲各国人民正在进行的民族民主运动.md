The signing ceremony of the joint statement was held in Beijing this morning.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Odon Alvarez de la Campa, head of the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation and Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Federation, signed the joint statement on behalf of the trade unions of the two countries respectively.

Liu Changsheng, Zhu Xuefan, and Chen Shaomin, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Li Zaiwen, Secretary of the Secretariat; Chen Yu, Director of the International Liaison Department; and Li Yunchuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Machinery Trade Union, attended the signing ceremony.

The Cuban side attending the signing ceremony included the members of the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation: Carlos Fernandez, Luis Gonzalez, and Aydeé Guahí.

After the signing, the two sides toasted each other, warmly congratulating the signing of the joint statement.

The delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation, headed by Odon Alvarez de la Campa, returned to Beijing on the 14th after ending its visit to Shanghai. On the 15th, it held talks with Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other leaders in a friendly atmosphere on the joint statement to be issued by the trade unions of the two countries, and reached a consensus.

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th -- The full text of the joint statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Cuban Workers' Federation is as follows:

At the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation, headed by Odon Alvarez de la Campa, Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Federation, visited the People's Republic of China in July 1960. During the visit, they held cordial talks with Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other leaders on opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, supporting the just struggle of the Cuban people, supporting the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and strengthening and further developing the friendly solidarity between the workers and trade unions of China and Cuba, and issued the following joint statement:

1. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Cuban Workers' Federation unanimously and severely condemn the U.S. imperialism's shameless interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the serious crimes of sabotaging the Cuban revolution. U.S. imperialism is extremely hostile to the victory of the Cuban revolution. For more than a year, U.S. imperialism has resorted to all kinds of despicable and vicious means, from spreading rumors and slanders to assassinations and bombings, from economic blockade to military threats, from intensifying internal subversion to planning international intervention, in an attempt to turn Cuba into a second Guatemala and dreaming of immersing the Cuban people in blood again.

Recently, the activities and clamor of U.S. imperialism to interfere in Cuba have intensified in an attempt to launch armed aggression. U.S. imperialism fabricated the Havana armory explosion incident; openly declared that it would occupy the Guantanamo naval base for a long time and continuously increase its troops to the base; protected and armed war criminals and counter-revolutionaries to form an advance team for the invasion of Cuba; and stopped the shipment of oil to Cuba and reduced the quota for Cuban sugar imports in the U.S. market, attempting to economically strangle Cuba. Rockefeller openly demanded that the U.S. Marines land in Cuba. Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, issued an arrogant and unreasonable statement on July 9, posing as the master of the Western Hemisphere, and expressed his intention to continue to use a series of treaties imposed by the United States on Latin American countries to intensify the planning of intervention in Cuba. The United States is trying to use the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the American states of the Organization of American States, a docile tool of Washington, to "discuss" the Cuban issue and launch international intervention in Cuba.

Both sides emphasized that this series of activities fully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism is impatiently and unscrupulously trying to strangle the Cuban revolution and suppress the increasingly high patriotic and just struggle of the Latin American countries against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries.

Both sides unanimously and severely condemn: U.S. imperialism still occupies China's territory Taiwan, constantly creating tension in the Taiwan Strait region, and signed a new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan. Both sides severely condemn: Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, conducted a robber-like tour to the Far East, conspiring to strengthen the U.S. aggression front in Asia and plotting new wars.

Both sides unanimously pointed out that the above-mentioned criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in these regions are part of its entire aggressive war policy. U.S. imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, undermining the four-nation summit conference and the ten-nation disarmament conference. After the U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Union and Eisenhower declared a "cessation" of such aggressive activities, on July 1, it once again dispatched an RB-47 military aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace. In Africa, the United States is actively planning a large-scale international armed intervention in the Republic of the Congo.

All this proves that U.S. imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the Cuban people and the Latin American people, but also the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese and Asian and African peoples, and the common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. U.S. imperialism supports the reactionaries of various countries, does all kinds of bad things, and has not only aroused increasingly strong opposition from the people of all countries in the world, but also aroused dissatisfaction among American workers and peace-loving people. A world-wide storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is rising, and U.S. imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation, and their days are getting worse and worse.

2. Both sides unanimously believe that the victory of the Cuban revolution marks a new stage in the Latin American people's struggle for national liberation. After a long and arduous armed struggle, the Cuban people finally overthrew the U.S.-backed reactionary dictatorial regime, and then took a series of major revolutionary measures to safeguard national sovereignty, develop the national economy, and implement land reform, and resolutely embarked on the road of complete independence, regardless of U.S. threats. The Cuban workers and people demonstrated revolutionary heroism and an indomitable fighting will.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that the heroic struggle waged by the Cuban workers and people under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro has not only opened a gap in the chain of colonialism imposed by U.S. imperialism on the Latin American people, but also convincingly proved to the Latin American people that U.S. imperialism is not so terrible, and as long as a resolute struggle is waged, and only by waging a resolute struggle, can the enemy be continuously attacked and victory achieved. Inspired by the revolutionary victory of the Cuban people, the national democratic revolution movements in Latin American countries are rising unprecedentedly.

The Cuban Workers' Federation believes that under the leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong, the victory of the Chinese revolution shattered the imperialist chains of domination in Asia and illuminated the path of liberation for the people of colonies and dependent countries.

The Chinese workers and people, who have suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time and are still under U.S. imperialist aggression and threat today, deeply understand and sympathize with the past experiences and today's struggle of the Cuban workers and people. The Chinese workers and people have always supported the revolutionary struggle of the Cuban workers and people, regarding the struggle of the Cuban workers and people as their own struggle, regarding the victory of the Cuban workers and people as their own victory, and believing that every achievement of the Cuban workers and people is a strong support and encouragement to the Chinese workers and people. The Cuban workers and people can fully expect to receive the fraternal and firm support of the Chinese workers and people in their just struggle.

The Cuban Workers' Federation expresses its firm support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

The Cuban Workers' Federation calls on the workers and trade union organizations of all countries in the world to seriously pay attention to and be vigilant about the current danger of U.S. imperialism carrying out military intervention in Cuba, and to launch active actions to support the Cuban workers and people in defending the revolution and opposing U.S. imperialist intervention, especially when the threat of U.S. imperialist military intervention is increasing. Both sides emphasized that the U.S. aggression against Cuba has seriously threatened world peace, as pointed out in the recent letter of accusation from the Cuban Foreign Minister to the United Nations Security Council. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions warmly supports the just demands of the Cuban Workers' Federation and believes that this appeal of the Cuban Workers' Federation will surely be responded to and supported by workers and trade union organizations of all countries in the world, especially Asian and African countries.

3. Both sides are pleased to see that a vigorous national democratic revolutionary wave is sweeping across Latin America; the storm of the people of Asian countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is rising and expanding; and the movement of the people of African countries to strive for national independence is developing vigorously. The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other.

Both sides unanimously expressed their firm support for the national democratic movements currently underway in Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Both sides expressed admiration for the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for national independence against colonialism, and firmly support their national liberation war. Both sides firmly support the patriotic and righteous struggle of the Congolese military and people against armed intervention in the Congo. Both sides firmly support the anti-U.S. patriotic and righteous struggles of the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Turkish people; firmly support the just struggles of the people of countries such as the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Paraguay against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs; and firmly support the struggle of the Panamanian people and the Puerto Rican people for sovereignty and national independence.

Both sides are pleased to see that the solidarity and mutual support among the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States has greatly developed. The movement of workers and people in Latin American countries to support Cuba has become a broad mass movement, and the solidarity of the Latin American working class and trade union organizations is increasingly strengthened. Both sides firmly believe that the just struggles of the workers and people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with the firm support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and with the broad solidarity and mutual support of the working class and people of the world, will surely achieve final victory.

4. Both sides are satisfied to point out that since the victory of the Cuban People's Revolution in January 1959, the friendship between the workers and trade unions of China and Cuba in the struggle against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism has greatly developed. Delegations were exchanged on the International Labor Day of May 1 this year, which enhanced the mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between the workers and trade unions of the two countries. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is pleased to see that the Cuban workers, united around the Cuban Workers' Federation, have made great contributions in defending the Cuban revolution, developing the national economy, implementing land reform, and opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and intervention; it is also pleased to see that the Cuban Workers' Federation has made active efforts to improve the lives of Cuban workers. In July 1960, the delegation of the Cuban Workers' Federation successfully visited the People's Republic of China and signed a joint statement with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which marks a new development in the friendly relations between the workers and trade unions of China and Cuba.

Both sides unanimously agree that the trade unions of the two countries will work to consolidate and continue to develop the solidarity and mutual support of the Chinese and Cuban working classes in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, and will continue to exchange delegations and exchange experiences in trade union activities. Both sides firmly believe that the friendly relationship between the trade unions of China and Cuba will further promote the solidarity of the trade union movement in Asia and Latin America and make a positive contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the international trade union movement.

    以奥东·阿伐莱斯·德·拉·坎巴为首的古巴工人联合会代表团结束了在上海的访问以后于14日回到北京，15日与中华全国总工会主席刘宁一等领导人，在友好的气氛中就两国工会发表联合声明进行了会谈，并且取得了一致的意见。
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会和古巴工人联合会联合声明，全文如下：
    应中华全国总工会的邀请，以古巴工人联合会对外关系书记奥东·阿伐莱斯·德·拉·坎巴为首的古巴工人联合会代表团，在1960年7月访问了中华人民共和国。在访问期间，同中华全国总工会主席刘宁一等领导人，就反对美帝国主义的侵略，支援古巴人民的正义斗争，支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动和加强与进一步发展中古两国工人和工会之间的友好团结问题，进行了亲切的会谈，并发表联合声明如下：
    一中华全国总工会和古巴工人联合会，一致严厉地谴责美帝国主义无耻地干涉古巴内政，破坏古巴革命的严重罪行。美帝国主义对于古巴革命的胜利是极端仇恨的。一年多以来，美帝国主义施展了种种卑鄙恶毒的手段，从造谣诽谤到暗杀轰炸，从经济封锁到军事威胁，从加紧内部颠覆到策划国际干涉，妄图把古巴变成第二个危地马拉，梦想把古巴人民重新淹浸在血泊里。
    最近，美帝国主义干涉古巴的活动和叫嚣变本加厉，以图发动武装侵略。美帝国主义制造了哈瓦那军火库爆炸事件；公开声称要长期霸占关塔那摩海军基地，并不断向基地增兵；保护和武装战争罪犯与反革命分子，以组成侵略古巴的先遣队；并对古巴停止运送石油，削减在美国市场的古巴食糖进口定额，企图从经济上扼杀古巴。洛克菲勒公开地要求美国海军陆战队在古巴登陆。美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔在7月9日发表的一项蛮横无理的声明中，俨然以西半球的主子自居，表示要继续利用美国强加在拉丁美洲各国身上的一系列条约来加紧策划对古巴的干涉。美国正力图利用华盛顿的驯服工具——美洲国家组织即将召开的美洲国家外长会议来“讨论”古巴问题，发动对古巴的国际干涉。
    双方着重指出：这一系列活动，充分说明美帝国主义已迫不及待、不择手段地要绞杀古巴革命，镇压拉丁美洲各国日益高涨的反对美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗的爱国正义斗争。
    双方一致严厉谴责：美帝国主义至今仍然霸占着中华人民共和国的领土台湾，不断在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，和日本岸信介政府签订了新的美日军事同盟条约。双方严厉地谴责：美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔到远东进行强盗旅行，阴谋加强美国在亚洲的侵略阵线，策划新的战争。
    双方一致指出，美帝国主义在上述地区的罪恶活动，是其整个侵略战争政策的一部分。美帝国主义正在加紧扩军备战，破坏了四国政府首脑会议和十国裁军会议，在U—2型间谍飞机被苏联击落、艾森豪威尔声明“停止”此类侵略活动后，7月1日又一次派遣RB—47型军用飞机侵犯苏联领空，美国在非洲正在积极策划对刚果共和国进行大规模的国际武装干涉。
    这一切证明了，美帝国主义不仅是古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的最凶恶的敌人，是中国和亚洲、非洲各国人民的最凶恶的敌人，也是全世界一切爱好和平人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义支持各国的反动派，做尽了坏事，不仅激起了全世界各国人民越来越强烈的反对，也引起了美国工人和爱好和平的人民的不满。一个世界性的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在兴起，美帝国主义已陷于空前孤立的境地，它们的日子是越来越不好过了。
    二双方一致认为，古巴革命的胜利，标志着拉丁美洲人民争取民族解放的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。古巴人民在经过长期艰巨的武装斗争之后，终于推翻了美国扶植的反动独裁政权，接着采取了一系列维护民族主权、发展民族经济、实行土地改革等重大革命措施，不顾美国的威胁，坚定地走上了完全独立的道路。古巴工人和人民表现了革命的英雄气概和不屈不挠的斗争意志。
    中华全国总工会认为：古巴工人和人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理领导下所进行的英勇斗争，不仅在美帝国主义强加在拉丁美洲人民身上的殖民主义锁链上打开了一个缺口，而且令人信服地向拉丁美洲各国人民证明了：美帝国主义并不是那样可怕的，只要进行坚决的斗争，也只有进行坚决的斗争，就能够不断地打击敌人，取得胜利。在古巴人民革命胜利的鼓舞下，拉丁美洲各国民族民主革命运动空前地高涨起来。
    古巴工人联合会认为：在伟大的领袖毛泽东的领导下，中国革命的胜利打碎了帝国主义在亚洲的统治锁链，照亮了殖民地和附属国人民解放的道路。
    长期遭受过帝国主义侵略和压迫，今天还受着美帝国主义的侵略和威胁的中国工人和人民，深刻地理解和同情古巴工人和人民过去的遭遇和今天的斗争。中国工人和人民一贯支持古巴工人和人民的革命斗争，把古巴工人和人民的斗争当作中国工人和人民自己的斗争，把古巴工人和人民的胜利看成是中国工人和人民自己的胜利，并认为古巴工人和人民的每一个成就，都是对中国工人和人民的有力支持和鼓舞。古巴工人和人民在自己的正义斗争中，完全可以指望得到中国工人和人民兄弟般的坚决支持。
    古巴工人联合会表示：坚决支持中国人民解放台湾、反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    古巴工人联合会呼吁全世界各国工人和工会组织，严重地注视和警惕目前美帝国主义对古巴进行军事干涉的危险，展开积极行动支持古巴工人和人民保卫革命、反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争，特别是在目前美帝国主义的军事干涉威胁日益增长的时候。双方着重指出：美国对古巴的侵略行为已严重地威胁着世界和平，正如古巴外交部长最近致联合国安全理事会的控诉信中所指出的那样。中华全国总工会热烈支持古巴工人联合会的正义要求，并相信，古巴工人联合会这一呼吁一定会得到世界各国特别是亚非各国工人与工会组织的响应与支持。
    三双方高兴地看到：一个气势磅礴的民族民主革命浪潮正席卷整个拉丁美洲；亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的风暴正在兴起和扩大；非洲各国人民争取民族独立的运动，正在如火如荼地蓬勃开展。全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是相互支持的。
    双方一致表示：坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民目前正在进行的民族民主运动。双方对为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民表示敬佩，并坚决支持他们的民族解放战争。双方坚决支持刚果军民的爱国正义斗争，反对武装干涉刚果。双方坚决支持日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民所进行的反美爱国正义斗争；坚决支持多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭等国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争；坚决支持巴拿马人民和波多黎各人民争取主权和民族独立的斗争。
    双方高兴地看到，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，相互团结和相互支持有了巨大的发展。拉丁美洲各国工人和人民支持古巴的运动已经成为广泛的群众性运动，拉丁美洲工人阶级与工会组织的团结正在日益加强。双方深信，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国工人和人民的正义斗争，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚决支持下，在全世界工人阶级和人民的广泛团结和相互支援下，必将取得最后的胜利。四
    双方满意地指出，自从1959年
  1月古巴人民革命胜利以来，中古两国工人和工会在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中结成的友谊有了很大的发展。在今年“五一”国际劳动节互派了代表团，增进了两国工人和工会之间的相互了解和兄弟友谊。中华全国总工会高兴地看到，古巴工人团结在古巴工人联合会的周围，在保卫古巴革命、发展民族经济、实行土地改革和反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉的斗争中，作出了巨大的贡献；也高兴地看到，古巴工人联合会为改善古巴工人生活作出了积极的努力。1960年7月，古巴工人联合会代表团成功地访问了中华人民共和国，同中华全国总工会签订了联合声明，这标志着中古两国工人和工会友好关系的新发展。
    双方一致同意，两国工会将为巩固和继续发展中古工人阶级在反对帝国主义和维护世界和平斗争中的团结和相互支持而努力，继续交换代表团和交流工会活动经验。双方深信，中古两国工会的友好关系，将进一步促进亚洲和拉丁美洲工会运动的团结，为加强国际工会运动的团结作出积极的贡献。
