    Fundamental Plan
    Kong Sang
    In the mass movement to support agriculture, many cities regard supporting county and commune industries—mainly farm tool repair and manufacturing plants for the purpose of serving agricultural production—as an important component. They say: This is supporting agriculture "from the root." The experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years has proven that if any construction project is based on self-reliance, the project will definitely develop rapidly; otherwise, things often cannot be realized as perfectly as subjective wishes. Many places are putting great effort into supporting the county and commune farm tool repair and manufacturing industry, with the aim of helping agricultural technological transformation establish a foundation of self-reliance. With this leg plus the leg of urban large-scale industry, walking on two legs can achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical agricultural technological transformation.
    However, the roots of county and commune industries cannot be deeply planted just for agricultural machinery plants. Because the machinery industry is a processing industry, it must have sufficient steel to fully function. Where does the steel come from? Rely on urban supply? Obviously, according to China's current steel production level, it is impossible to meet the needs of all county and commune machinery plants in the country. To solve this problem more thoroughly, it is necessary to develop the county and commune steel industry and mining industry, and establish county and commune's own heavy industrial raw material base. In this way, the county and commune machinery plant, an important force in agricultural technological transformation, can take deep root, thrive, and flourish.
    Many counties in our country have both coal and iron resources, and the conditions for widely distributing steel "small native groups" and "small foreign groups" are very good. However, there are also many counties without coal and iron, or with coal but no iron, or with iron but no coal. What should these counties do? Now, the Jinhua area provides a good experience—organizing coal and iron joint ventures between counties, with some counties providing coal, some counties providing iron, some counties providing technology, and some counties providing labor. In this way, several counties can jointly establish the steel industry and have raw materials for manufacturing machinery. Moreover, this approach has some special advantages in the current situation. As everyone knows, steel, equipment manufacturing capacity, and labor are not very abundant now. To build new enterprises, it is impossible to reduce the task of transferring coal and iron out, or to draw labor from agriculture, or to affect the manufacturing plan of agricultural machinery. However, the approach in the Jinhua area can avoid these difficulties. Not only can the existing smelting capacity be fully utilized without adding new furnaces, but also no new manpower needs to be added. It achieves multiple goals with one move, which shows that this is a good experience worth promoting.
    We often say that cooperation generates new productivity. The experience of the Jinhua area provides another new example. Let us give full play to the superiority of the socialist system to accelerate the construction of our new countryside and speed up the pace of agricultural technological transformation!

    根本大计
    孔桑
    在支援农业的全民运动中，不少城市把支援县、社工业——主要是以服务农业生产为目的的农具修造厂，当作一项重要内容。他们说：这是“从根子上”支援农业。这种做法很对，这种说法也很对。两年多来大跃进的经验证明，任何建设事业，如果立足于自力更生的基础上，这项事业就一定发展得快；否则事情就常常不能按照主观愿望实现得那么圆满。许多地方拿出很大的力量来支援县、社的农具修造工业，其目的就是为了帮助农业技术改造建立一个自力更生的基础。这一条腿再加上城市大工业的一条腿，两条腿走路，就可以使农业技术改造实现多快好省的要求。
    但是，只是为了农业机械厂，县、社工业的根子还不能扎得深。因为，机械工业是加工工业，必须有充足的钢铁，才能充分发挥作用。钢铁哪里来呢？依靠城市供应吗？显然，按照我国目前的钢铁生产水平，不可能满足全国所有县、社机械厂的需要。要比较彻底地解决这个问题，必须发展县、社的钢铁工业和采掘工业，建立县、社自己的重工业原料基地。这样，县、社机械厂这支农业技术改造的重要力量，才能够根深叶茂，本固枝荣。
    我国很多县兼有煤铁资源，广布钢铁“小土群”“小洋群”的条件是很好的。但是，也还有不少的县没有煤和铁，或者有煤无铁，有铁无煤。这样的县怎么办呢？现在，金华地区提供了一个好经验——在县与县之间组织煤铁联营，有的县出煤，有的县出铁，有的县出技术，有的县出劳力。这样，几个县联合就可以把钢铁工业办起来，就有了制造机械的原料了。而且，这种做法在目前的情况下还有一些特殊的优点。大家都知道，现在钢铁、设备制造能力和劳动力都并不是很充裕的，要建设新企业，既不能减少煤铁的外调任务，又不能从农业中抽调劳力，也不能影响农业机具的制造计划。而金华地区的做法，却可以避免这些困难，不但既有的冶炼能力可以充分发挥，不需要增加新的炉子，而且可以不增加新的人力。一举数得，可见这是一个很值得推广的好经验。
    我们常说，协作产生新的生产力。金华地区的经验又提供了一个新的例证。让我们充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，来加速建设我们的新农村，加快农业技术改造的速度吧！
