Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The China-Vietnam Friendship Association recently sent a telegram to the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to demand that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam and to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The telegram said that it has been six years since the signing of the Geneva Agreement on Vietnam, but due to the continuous sabotage by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet clique, not only has the urgent desire of all the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland not been realized to this day, but also, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet clique is intensifying its frenzied slaughter and suppression of patriotic people in South Vietnam; and in order to meet the requirements of U.S. imperialism, it has agreed with the United States to illegally increase the military personnel of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, turning South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and a military base for launching aggressive wars. All this has brought immense disasters to the people of South Vietnam and seriously violated the Geneva Agreement.

The telegram pointed out that the crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam have once again exposed its bellicose and hideous face. The people of the world have become increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of mankind, and only by waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism can we shatter its policies of aggression and war conspiracies, and defend world peace.

The telegram said that the people of China and Vietnam are brothers, sharing weal and woe. The Chinese people vow to stand with the Vietnamese people and resolutely fight the common enemy of the world – U.S. imperialism – to the end. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S.-Ngo reactionary clique will surely achieve final victory.

　　中越友协致电越中友协
　　支持越南人民的正义斗争
　　中国人民誓与越南人民一起同美帝国主义斗争到底
    新华社16日讯　中越友好协会最近致电越南越中友好协会，支持越南人民要求美帝国主义滚出越南南方、实现祖国和平统一的正义的斗争。
    电报说，关于越南的日内瓦协议签订已六年，但是由于美帝国主义和吴庭艳傀儡集团不断地进行破坏，不仅使全体越南人民迫切要求祖国和平统一的愿望至今未能实现，而且，吴庭艳傀儡集团在美帝指使下还在加强对越南南方爱国人民进行疯狂的屠杀和镇压；并且为了适应美帝国主义的要求，与美国协议非法增加美国的军事援助顾问团的军事人员，将越南南方变成美国的殖民地和发动侵略战争的军事基地。这一切给越南南方的人民带来了莫大的灾难，并且严重地破坏了日内瓦协议。
    电报指出，美帝国主义在南越犯下的罪行，再一次暴露了它的好战成性的狰狞面目。全世界人民已经越来越清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是人类最凶恶的敌人，只有同美帝国主义作坚决的斗争，才能粉碎它的侵略政策和战争阴谋，保卫世界和平。
    电报说，中越两国人民是亲兄弟，有着休戚相关、安危与共的关系。中国人民誓与越南人民站在一起，坚决和世界人民公敌——美帝国主义斗争到底。我们深信，越南人民反对美吴反动集团的斗争一定会获得最后胜利。
