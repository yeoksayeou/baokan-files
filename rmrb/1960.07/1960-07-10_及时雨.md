The 300,000 people of Xin'an County, Henan Province, under the leadership of the Party, overcame the threat of a 200-day severe drought and won a bumper harvest of summer crops this year. In the fields and on the threshing grounds, whenever people talked about the reasons for this year's bumper wheat harvest, they said with infinite gratitude: "This is inseparable from the great contribution of industrial support!"

In Xin'an County, many members of rural people's communes refer to the county and commune industries as the "timely rain" that supports agriculture. This spring, after the drought challenged the people, workers throughout the county put forward the slogan "Town and country are united as one, forcing the heavens to bow their heads; workers and peasants are of one heart, determined to fight the drought and seize a bumper harvest." More than 10,000 employees of county and commune industries either rushed to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery, increased the production of drought-resistant materials, or went directly to the fields to participate in digging canals and wells, fighting alongside the peasants day and night. The county's 800-plus mechanical workers, in just five days, repaired 63 irrigation and drainage machines, produced more than 35,000 pieces of equipment such as water tanks and handcarts, and promptly投入投入抗旱斗争, расширился расширился больше больше than 20,000 mu. The county and commune machinery factories also dispatched more than 100 people to form mobile repair teams, going deep into the fields to ensure that irrigation machinery was repaired as soon as it broke down.

In mid-April, a battle to eliminate third-class seedlings began. All 380 fertilizer plants in the county投入战斗. In Temen Commune's 10,000-mu high-yield area, some third-class seedlings appeared due to uneven fertilization. Some commune members said, "The wheat has already jointed; it's useless to manage it anymore." However, the employees of the commune fertilizer plant did not think so. After repeated experiments, they finally produced a quick-acting fertilizer—gibberellin crystalline powder. Applying this fertilizer to the third-class seedlings, after three days, the wheat seedlings turned from yellow to green and grew rapidly. More than 1,000 mu of third-class seedlings were all brought up to the level of first-class seedlings.

This March, just as the drought was severely threatening the growth of wheat, the Luoyang First Tractor Factory sent three 54-horsepower "Dongfanghong" brand diesel engines and three water pumps with a head of 120 meters to Xin'an County. The county party committee decided to use these machines to build ten large-scale pumping stations on鳖盖Mountain. When the good news came, the 2,000 members of Yancang Brigade jumped up with joy. Men and women, old and young, carrying shovels and hoes, rushed to the construction site to repair the irrigation and drainage canal. In just four days, the pumping station and an eight *li*-long mountain canal were built. The surging Yellow River water was obediently diverted up the mountain, and more than 5,000 mu of dry land were all irrigated. Gao Weiheng, the party branch secretary of the brigade, said with full confidence: "With the pumping station, we are not afraid of turning Turtleback Mountain into a little Jiangnan."

    及时雨
    河南新安县三十万人民，在党的领导下，战胜了二百天严重干旱的威胁，夺得了今年夏收作物的大丰收。在田野里，在麦场上，每当人们谈论起今年小麦大丰收的原因时，都以无限感激的心情说：“这是和工业支援的汗马功劳分不开的呀！”
    在新安县，许多农村人民公社的社员都把县社工业称作是支援农业的“及时雨”。今年春天，干旱向人们发出挑衅以后，全县的工人就提出了“城乡一杆旗，力逼老天把头低；工农一条心，决战旱魔夺丰收”的口号。县社工业的一万多名职工，有的赶制排灌机械，有的增产抗旱物资，有的直接到田间参加开渠打井，日日夜夜和农民战斗在一起。全县八百多名机械工人，仅仅用了五天的时间，就修复了排灌机械六十三台，生产了水箱、架子车等三万五千多件，及时投入了抗旱斗争，扩大了灌溉面积二万多亩。县、社的机械厂，还抽调了一百多人组成了流动修配组，深入田间，保证灌溉机械随坏随修。
    4月中旬，一场消灭三类苗的战斗开始了。全县三百八十个化肥厂都投入战斗。铁门公社的万亩丰产方里，由于施肥不匀，出现了一些三类苗。有的社员说：“小麦已经拔节了，再管理也是白费劲。”可是，公社化肥厂的职工却不这么想。他们经过反复试验，终于制成了一种速效肥——赤霉素结晶粉。把这种肥料追施到三类苗身上，三天以后，麦苗就由黄变绿，陡起猛长。一千多亩三类苗，就这样全部赶上了一类苗。
    今年3月，正当干旱严重威胁着麦子生长的时候，洛阳第一拖拉机厂给新安县送来了三部五十四马力的“东方红”牌柴油机和三部扬程一百二十米的抽水机。县委决定用这些机器在鳖盖山上建立十个大型抽水机站。喜讯传来，盐仓大队的二千名社员高兴得跳起来。男男女女，老老少少，背锨扛镢，奔向抢修排灌大渠的工地。只用四天的时间，抽水机站和一条八华里长的盘山大渠就建成了。汹涌澎湃的黄河水被乖乖地引上山来，五千多亩旱地全部实现了水浇化。大队党支部书记高维恒信心百倍地说：“有了抽水机站，不怕鳖盖山不变成小江南。”
