The heroic Congolese people have once again sounded the battle horn against imperialism and colonialism on the African continent. Congolese patriotic soldiers and the Congolese people have risen up to engage in heroic resistance against the colonial bandits who are invading their motherland's sacred territory. In important cities and ports such as Luluabourg, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Matadi, as well as in the Jadotville uranium mining area, and even in the Congolese capital of Leopoldville, Congolese patriotic soldiers and the people are fighting together heroically against the Belgian paratrooper forces equipped with modern weapons. Especially in the port of Matadi, Congolese soldiers, with the support of the masses, have repeatedly repelled the attacks of the Belgian colonial army, shot down a Belgian military aircraft, and heroically defended this important port. Now, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba has announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Belgium and has ordered Belgian troops to withdraw from the territory of the Republic of the Congo. The Congolese soldiers and the broad masses of the people have demonstrated a great determination to defend their motherland and maintain their independence in the struggle.

The 650 million Chinese people angrily condemn the aggressive crimes committed by the Belgian colonialists against the Congo with the support of the American-led imperialist bloc, and infinitely sympathize with and resolutely support the sacred struggle of the Congolese people against imperialist aggression and interference, and to defend the independence of their motherland. Our government issued a solemn statement on July 19, stating that "The Chinese government and people deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people, and believe that the Belgian invading army must immediately and completely withdraw from the Congo, and the American-led imperialist countries must immediately stop interfering in the Congo." This statement from our government expresses the unwavering will of all the Chinese people to sympathize with and support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people.

The Belgian colonialists' armed aggression against the Republic of the Congo completely exposes the heinous nature of imperialism and colonialism. The imperialists and colonialists, when faced with the struggle of the colonial peoples, may be forced to make certain concessions to ease the struggle of the colonial peoples and maintain their colonial interests in a disguised form. However, when the colonial peoples rise up further, resolutely demand true independence, and touch the sensitive spots of colonial interests, the true colors of imperialism are completely revealed. The Republic of the Congo was only eight days old when the Belgian colonialists, regardless of all consequences and at all costs, attempted to strangle this newborn republic. Haven't all the masks of "benevolence" and "gifts" of the imperialists and colonialists been torn off at once? However, the Belgian colonialists describe the bloody suppression of the Congolese national independence movement as being for the "protection" of the interests of Belgium and the so-called "free world." This precisely shows what the so-called "free world" of the colonialists is all about. In this "free world," there is only the "freedom" of the imperialists and colonialists to plunder, enslave, and invade other nations, while the freedom of the oppressed nations to demand independence and the freedom to demand basic sovereignty is completely absent.

After the Belgian colonialists launched their armed aggression against the Congo, the imperialist countries were all eager to try, employing all kinds of conspiracies, including dividing the territory of the Congo and directly participating in armed intervention, attempting to fish in troubled waters and infiltrate their own forces into the Congo. Especially American imperialism, which on the one hand is fully supporting the Belgian colonialists in sending troops to the Congo to suppress the Congolese people's resistance, and on the other hand is trying every possible means to create conditions to replace Belgium in the Congo. A statement issued by the U.S. State Department spokesman on July 11 laid the groundwork for direct U.S. military intervention, distorting the situation in the Congo by saying that "law and order have broken down in various parts of the Congo," and therefore the United States "clearly has a need to protect the lives of its nationals by any appropriate means." After this, the U.S. ambassador to the Congo engaged in extensive activities, seeking some legitimate excuse to send U.S. troops into the Congo. Two U.S. infantry companies stationed in West Germany were placed on "alert," the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" sailed to the South Atlantic, and U.S. Defense Secretary Gates even openly clamored that the U.S. was ready to send troops to the Congo and "anywhere in the world" at any time. These facts show that U.S. imperialism is preparing to carry out direct armed intervention in the Congo at any moment.

However, under the watchful eyes of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism does not dare to be too blatant, and it cannot but have some concerns about directly sending troops to the Congo. The "New York Herald Tribune" admitted that U.S. imperialism feared that unilateral military intervention would cause a "terrible reaction" in Africa. This means that in order to continue to wear the mask of so-called "sympathy" for the African national independence movement in Africa, U.S. imperialism must adopt more insidious means than direct armed intervention. Currently, while actively deploying for direct military intervention in the Congo, U.S. imperialism is making extensive use of the name of the United Nations to cover up its activities of infiltrating the Congo on a large scale. The U.S. imperialism voted "in favor" of the Tunisian proposal to send UN troops to the Congo in the United Nations, while its representative Lodge stated that it had "doubts" about whether the proposal's request for the withdrawal of the Belgian invading army from the Congo was "wise." The United States' "support" for Tunisia's proposal is not to ask the United Nations to stop the Belgian aggression, but has ulterior motives and other plans. The American propaganda machine is advocating the establishment of a permanent UN police force to "help" the Congolese government "restore order." UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche (an American) is carrying out activities to expand interference in the Congo in the name of the UN political representative. This conspiracy of the United States has aroused the vigilance of the Congolese government and people. A telegram signed by Congolese national leaders Kasavubu and Lumumba, broadcast by Congolese radio, clearly stated that the Congo hopes that the United Nations' "military assistance" is not for "restoring internal order," but for stopping the aggression of Belgian troops. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba once again solemnly condemned the United States' position in the United Nations in support of Belgium in the Congolese parliament on July 15, and reiterated that the United Nations troops can only remain in the Congo "when they are here for the benefit of the Congo, not for the benefit of Belgium."

In order to defend the crimes of U.S. imperialism in interfering with and invading the Congo, the propagandists of Wall Street monopoly capital are now clamoring in lengthy articles that the Congo's "independence" is not yet "ready" and is "obviously immature," and so on. In short, in the eyes of the American imperialists, the Congolese people can never be self-reliant; if the Congo wants "independence," it can only rely on American "aid." However, their so-called "independence" is nothing more than nominal "independence" under the control of American colonial forces. The real independence of the Congo is intolerable to American imperialism. The high-sounding tune of "sympathy" for the "independence" of African countries that the United States has sung has once again revealed its true colors on the Congo issue. In fact, the policy of U.S. imperialism toward the entire Africa is to create false "independence," that is, to accelerate this process of replacing the old colonial rule of those old-brand colonial countries with the new colonial rule of the United States in Africa. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite recently said without concealment: "We (the United States) have placed a big bet on Africa, and a huge vacuum has been created." And the "vacuum" refers to all the newly independent countries in Africa. U.S. imperialism clearly knows that, due to the important position of the Congo in Africa, the further development of the Congolese national independence movement will inevitably have an immeasurable impact on the struggle of the people of African countries for genuine national independence. If this influence is not stopped, the entire colonial plan of U.S. imperialism in Africa will be declared bankrupt. Therefore, it can be seen very clearly that one of the important reasons for U.S. imperialism's stepped-up planning for armed intervention in the Congo this time is to prevent and stifle the entire African national independence movement. The "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the U.S. State Department, published an editorial on July 11, making a shameless threat to the Congolese government, saying: "The new Congolese government must realize that, to a certain extent, the entire African nationalist movement depends on the development of the situation in the Congo." So things are very clear: U.S. imperialism is not only the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the Congolese people today, but also the most ferocious and dangerous common enemy of the people of all African countries.

But today, the storm of the African national independence movement has shaken the entire continent, and the days when imperialism arbitrarily ravages Africa are gone forever. The situation is very favorable for the Congolese people's struggle for independence. The Belgian colonialists' reoccupation of the Congo and various conspiracies by the American-led imperialism to take the opportunity to invade the Congo have aroused the anger of African countries, which regard the Congolese people's struggle as a struggle related to the entire African people's maintenance and striving for independence, and give deep sympathy and support. Following the Congolese government's announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with the Belgian government, Guinea announced the suspension of diplomatic relations with Belgium, Libya announced the prohibition of Belgian military aircraft from flying over its airspace, and Ghana, the United Arab Republic, and many other countries resolutely opposed the imperialist conspiracy to split the Congo and refused to recognize the so-called "independence" of Katanga Province. On July 18, nine African countries in the United Nations issued a joint statement, resolutely demanding the complete withdrawal of the Belgian invading army from the territory of the Republic of the Congo, opposing the shameful conspiracy of imperialism to split the Congo, and safeguarding the independence and integrity of the Congo. All of these indicate that the African countries deeply affected by the disasters of imperialism share the same hatred. They are further uniting in solidarity and fighting together in the just struggle to support the Congolese people, supporting each other, and determined to defeat any conspiracy by the American-led imperialism to suppress the African national independence movement.

The just struggle of the Congolese people has received the sympathy and support of the vast majority of people around the world, especially the sympathy and support of the socialist countries. The Soviet government has issued a solemn statement demanding an immediate end to the armed aggression against the Congo. The Chinese people once rejoiced for the independence of the Congolese people and express infinite anger at the aggressive acts of the Belgian colonialists and the American-led imperialist countries to strangle the Republic of the Congo. We will always stand with the Congolese people and resolutely support the just struggle of the Congolese people against the colonialists. We firmly believe that with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the support of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, although the struggle task facing the Congolese people is arduous, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Congolese people!

### 中国人民坚决站在刚果人民这一边

　　中国人民坚决站在刚果人民这一边
    英勇的刚果人民在非洲大陆上又一次吹起了反对帝国主义和殖民主义的战斗号角，刚果的爱国士兵和刚果人民奋起对侵犯他们祖国神圣疆土的殖民匪徒展开了英勇的抵抗。在路路阿堡、伊利沙伯维尔、斯坦利维尔、马塔迪等重要城市和港口，在贾多特维尔铀矿区，以至在刚果的首都利奥波德维尔，刚果爱国士兵和人民一起，英勇地抗击拥有现代化武器装备的比利时伞兵部队。特别是在马塔迪港口，刚果士兵在人民群众的支援下，一再击退比殖民军的进攻，并击落比利时的军用飞机一架，英勇地坚守着这个重要的港口。现在，刚果总理卢蒙巴已经宣布同比利时中断外交关系，并且限令比利时军队撤出刚果共和国的领土。刚果士兵和广大人民在斗争中表现了保卫祖国和维护独立的伟大的决心。
    六亿五千万中国人民愤怒地谴责比利时殖民者在以美国为首的帝国主义集团支持下对刚果发动的侵略罪行，无限同情和坚决支持刚果人民反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉、保卫祖国独立的神圣斗争。我国政府于7月19日发表严正声明，表示“中国政府和人民深切同情和坚决支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争，并且认为，比利时侵略军必须立即全部撤出刚果，以美国为首的帝国主义国家必须立即停止干涉刚果”。我国政府的这个声明，表达了全中国人民同情和支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争的不可动摇的意志。
    比利时殖民者对刚果共和国的武装侵略，完全暴露了帝国主义和殖民主义者的穷凶极恶的本相。帝国主义和殖民主义者可以在殖民地人民起来斗争的情况下，被迫作出一定程度的让步，来缓和殖民地人民的斗争，用变相的形式，维持其殖民利益。但是，当殖民地人民进一步起来，坚决要求真正独立和触到殖民利益的疼处时，帝国主义的原形就毕露无遗了。刚果共和国诞生不过八天，比利时殖民者就不顾一切后果，不惜一切代价，要来扼杀这个新生的共和国。帝国主义和殖民者的一切“仁慈”、“恩赐”等等的画皮这一下岂不是全都揭下来了吗？但是，比利时殖民者却把对刚果民族独立运动的血腥镇压，说成是为了“保护”比利时和什么“自由世界”的利益。这恰恰说明了殖民主义者所谓的“自由世界”究竟是什么货色。在这个“自由世界”里，有的是帝国主义和殖民者掠夺、奴役和侵略其它民族的“自由”，而被压迫民族要求独立的自由、要求起码主权的自由，却是根本没有的。
    在比利时殖民主义者对刚果的武装侵略发生以后，帝国主义国家无不跃跃欲试，施展形形色色的阴谋活动，包括分割刚果的领土和直接参与武装干涉。企图混水摸鱼，把自己的力量渗入刚果。特别是美帝国主义，它一方面全力支持比利时殖民者出兵刚果，镇压刚果人民的反抗斗争；另一方面则千方百计地制造条件，企图取比利时在刚果的地位而代之。美国国务院发言人7月11日发表的声明就为美国的直接出兵埋下了伏笔，这个声明歪曲刚果的局势说“刚果各地的法律和秩序遭到破坏”，因此美国“显然有必要以任何适当的手段保护侨民的生命”。在这之后，美国驻刚果大使大肆活动，寻求某种合法借口使美国军队开进刚果。美国驻西德的两个步兵连处于“戒备状态”，美国“黄蜂号”航空母舰驶往南大西洋，美国国防部长盖茨甚至公然叫嚷美国随时准备派军队到刚果和“世界的任何地方去”。这些事实说明美帝国主义正在随时准备对刚果进行直接的武装干涉。
    然而，在全世界人民众目睽睽之下，美帝国主义还不敢做得太露骨了，对于直接出兵刚果还不能不有所顾忌。“纽约先驱论坛报”就供认，美帝国主义害怕单独出兵会在非洲引起“可怕的反响”。这就是说，美帝国主义为了在非洲继续戴上它所谓的“同情”非洲民族独立运动的假面具，它还必须采取比直接武装干涉更为阴险的手段。目前美帝国主义在积极部署对刚果直接进行军事干涉的同时，正在多方利用联合国的名义，掩护它大举渗入刚果的活动。美帝国主义在联合国一面投票“赞成”派遣联合国部队到刚果去的突尼斯提案，同时，它的代表洛奇又声明，对这个提案要求比利时侵略军撤出刚果一节，“是否明智”，表示“怀疑”。美国“支持”突尼斯的这个提案，并不是为了要求联合国去制止比利时的侵略，而是别具用心和另有打算。美国的宣传机器正在鼓吹建立联合国的常备警察部队来“帮助”刚果政府“恢复秩序”。联合国副秘书长本奇（美国人）正在以联合国政治代表的名义去刚果进行着扩大干涉的活动。美国的这种阴谋已经引起了刚果政府和人民的警惕。刚果电台广播一份由刚果国家领导人卡萨武布和卢蒙巴签署的电报说得很清楚，刚果希望联合国的“军事援助”，不是为了“恢复内部秩序”，而是为了制止比利时军队的侵略。刚果总理卢蒙巴7月15日在刚果议会又一次严正地谴责美国在联合国中支持比利时的立场，并且重申联合国的军队“只有他们在这里是为了刚果的利益，而不是为了比利时的利益时”，才能够留在刚果。
    为了替美帝国主义干涉和侵略刚果的罪行进行辩护，华尔街垄断资本的宣传家们，现正连篇累牍地叫嚣着什么刚果的“独立”还没有“准备好”、“显然不成熟”等等。总之，在美帝国主义者的眼里，刚果人民决不能自立；如果刚果想要
  “独立”，那就只有依靠美国的“援助”。但是，他们所谓的“独立”，无非是在美国殖民势力控制下，徒有虚名的“独立”而已。刚果的真正的独立，则是美帝国主义所不能容忍的。美国所唱的“同情”非洲各国“独立”的高调，这一回在刚果问题上又一次显出原形来了。事实上，美帝国主义对于整个非洲的政策就是要制造假的“独立”，就是要在非洲加速这种由美国的新殖民统治代替那些老牌殖民国家的旧殖民统治的过程。美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威脱最近毫不讳言地说：“我们（美国）在非洲放下了很大的赌注，一个巨大的真空已经产生”。而“真空”也者就是指的非洲所有的新独立国家。美帝国主义显然知道，由于刚果在非洲所处的重要地位，刚果民族独立运动的进一步发展，必将对非洲各国人民争取真正民族独立的斗争产生不可估量的影响。而这种影响如果不加阻止，美帝国主义对非洲的全部殖民计划将会宣告破产。因此可以看得很清楚，美帝国主义这次加紧策划武装干涉刚果的一个重要原因，正是为了阻止和扼杀整个非洲的民族独立运动。美国国务院的喉舌
  “纽约时报”7月11日的社论对刚果政府进行无耻的恫吓说：
  “新生的刚果政府必须认识到，在一定程度上，整个非洲的民族主义运动取决于刚果情况的发展”。所以事情是非常明白的，美帝国主义不仅是当前刚果人民的最凶恶、最危险的敌人；而且是非洲各国人民的最凶恶、最危险的共同敌人。
    但是今天，非洲民族独立运动的风暴，已经震撼了整个大陆，帝国主义任意蹂躏非洲的日子，已经一去不复返了。形势对刚果人民争取独立的斗争十分有利。比利时殖民主义者重新占领刚果和以美国为首的帝国主义乘机侵入刚果的各种阴谋活动，激起了非洲国家的愤怒，它们把刚果人民的斗争，看成是关系整个非洲人民维护和争取独立的斗争，并且给予深切的同情和支持。继刚果政府宣布同比利时政府断绝邦交之后，几内亚宣布中断同比利时的外交关系，利比亚宣布禁止比军用飞机飞越它的领空，加纳、阿联和许多其他国家，坚决反对帝国主义分裂刚果的阴谋，拒绝承认加丹加省的所谓“独立”。7月18日，联合国里的九个非洲国家发表联合声明，坚决要求比利时侵略军全部撤出刚果共和国的领土，反对帝国主义分裂刚果的可耻阴谋，维护刚果的独立和完整。所有这些，都表明了深受帝国主义灾难的非洲国家敌忾同仇。它们在声援刚果人民的正义斗争中，进一步团结起来，共同斗争，互相支持，决心击败以美国为首的帝国主义镇压非洲民族独立运动的任何阴谋。
    刚果人民的正义斗争得到全世界绝大多数人民的同情和支持，首先是社会主义国家的同情和支持。苏联政府已经发表严正声明，要求立即停止对刚果的武装侵略。中国人民曾经为刚果人民的独立而欢欣鼓舞，对于比利时殖民主义者和以美国为首的帝国主义国家扼杀刚果共和国的侵略行径表示无比的愤怒。我们将永远同刚果人民一起，坚决支持刚果人民反对殖民主义者的正义斗争。我们深信，有着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的坚决支持，有着全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，刚果人民面前的斗争任务虽然是艰巨的，但是最后的胜利一定属于英勇的刚果人民！
