This newspaper reports from Lanzhou on the 17th: The employees of the Transportation Department of the Yumen Petroleum Administration have relied on their own efforts to produce more than 300 types and 334,100 pieces of various automotive internal combustion engine accessories in the past year, accounting for more than 40% of the accessories needed. This has enabled the average vehicle availability rate of the entire department to reach 86.29%, and the number of vehicles waiting for repair in the factory has been reduced from more than 110 to 5. This has established a red flag for the high-speed development of transportation in industrial and mining areas and the large-scale diversification of operations in the transportation sector.

    With the rapid development of the petroleum industry, the transportation tasks of the Yumen Oil Mine have become increasingly heavy, and many damaged vehicles cannot be repaired and used in a timely manner due to a lack of accessories. To this end, the Transportation Department of the Yumen Petroleum Administration has adopted a self-reliance approach to manufacture automotive accessories. The employees, based on the principle of "using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from small to large, and from simple to complex," concentrated their efforts and successively manufactured 115 machine tools, laying a solid material foundation for the mass production of automotive accessories. In the manufacturing of accessories, the workers were even more ambitious and determined, and demonstrated a daring and capable style. Using the machine tools they manufactured, they not only produced general accessories such as various copper sleeves, belt pulleys, and white alloy bearings, but also produced advanced and precision automotive accessories such as piston rings, copper-lead alloy tiles, gearbox assemblies, and blower cores. When manufacturing this batch of accessories, without "foreign equipment," he used pots and buckets for copper melting and cooling. In order to master the proportion of copper-lead alloy, he crushed the original waste copper-lead tiles and compared them with his own manufactured tile blanks, studied its organizational composition, and experimented sixteen times before finally making copper-lead tile blanks.

    In the manufacturing of accessories, the workers also proceeded from reality and boldly improved the structure of more than ten kinds of automotive accessories. For example, the tooth shape of the main shaft gear of the small jeep gearbox is a very irregular displacement tooth shape, which cannot be processed and produced by general standard milling cutters. In the past, when trial-producing this gear, many tools were self-made and tested more than 50 times, but the quality was always unqualified. In this trial production, veteran worker Duan Shengwen, with the support of the Party General Branch and technical cadres, relied on the collective research of the masses, overturned the original design, revolutionized the displacement tooth shape, changed it to a standard tooth shape, and the quality was completely qualified. At present, in addition to the accessories for the automotive circuit system and large steel castings that cannot be produced, most of the accessories for other systems such as engine, braking steering, and cooling can be manufactured by this department.

    Due to the vigorous development of self-reliance, most of the automotive accessories have been supplied in a timely manner, strengthening weak links and promoting the continuous development of production. The workers used the automotive accessories they manufactured to successively repair 115 vehicles that had been waiting for a long time for repair materials, and now the vehicles entering the factory for repair can be repaired as soon as they arrive. From January to June this year, the vehicle availability rate of the entire department increased by 5.28% compared with the same period last year, completing half of the annual state plan 33 days ahead of schedule, and vigorously promoting crude oil production.

　　鼓干劲解决当务之急　闹革新猛攻薄弱环节
　　玉门制成三十万件汽车附件
　　本报兰州17日电　玉门石油管理局运输处职工自力更生，一年来自制各种汽车内燃机配件三百多种、三十三万四千一百多件，占配件需要量的40％以上，使全处车辆完好率平均达到86.29％，停厂待修车辆由一百一十多部减少到五部。为高速度发展工矿区运输事业和运输部门大搞多种经营树立了红旗。
    随着石油工业的飞跃发展，玉门油矿的运输任务日益繁重，有许多损坏了的汽车由于缺乏配件不能及时修复使用。为此，玉门石油管理局运输处采取自力更生的办法，
  自制汽车配件。职工们根据“土法上马，土洋结合，由小到大，由简到繁”的方针，集中力量，先后制造了一百一十五部机床，给大量制造汽车配件打下了坚实的物质基础。在制造配件中，工人们更是树雄心，立大志，发扬了敢想敢干的风格。他们用自己制造的机床，不仅生产出了各种铜套、皮带盘，白合金轴承等一般配件，而且还生产出了活塞环、铜铅合金瓦、变速箱总成和鼓风机芯子等高级精密的汽车配件。在制造这批配件时，没有“洋设备”，他用锅、水桶进行化铜和冷却。为了掌握铜铅合金配料比例，他把原有的废铜铅瓦片打碎，和自己制造的瓦坯作比较，研究它的组织成分，先后试验了十六次，终于制成了铜铅瓦坯。
    在制造配件中，工人们还从实际出发，大胆地改进了十多种汽车配件的结构。例如小吉普变速箱主轴齿轮的齿形是一种很不规则的变位齿形，一般标准铣刀不能加工生产。过去在试制这种齿轮时，曾自制许多刀具，试验过五十多次，质量始终不合格。在这次试制中，老工人段生文在党总支和技术干部的支持下，依靠群众集体研究，推翻了原设计，革掉了变位齿形的命，改为标准齿形，质量完全合格。目前，这个处除汽车电路系统的配件和大型铸钢件不能生产外，其他如引擎、制动转向、冷却等系统的大部分配件都能自己制造了。
    由于大搞自力更生，使大部分汽车配件得到及时供应，加强了薄弱环节，推动了生产的不断发展。工人们用自己制造的汽车配件，先后修复了一百一十五辆长期待料修理的汽车，并且使现在进厂修理的车辆作到了随到随修。今年1至6月份，全处车辆完好率比去年同期提高5.28％，提前三十三天完成全年国家计划的一半，有力地推动了原油生产。
