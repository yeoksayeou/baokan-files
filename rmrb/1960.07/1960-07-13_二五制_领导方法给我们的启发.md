　　Enlightenment from the "Two-Five System" Leadership Method

After the People's Daily published the news and editorial on June 16th, "Hebei Promotes the 'Two-Five System' Leadership Method," the county party committee immediately organized the standing committee members of the county party committee, the heads of various departments of county-level organs, and the first secretaries of the commune party committees to study. After studying these articles, everyone agreed that they were deeply enlightened and gained a lot.

For a long time, especially since the Great Leap Forward, cadres at all levels in our county have deeply felt that the situation is developing rapidly, and the leadership style and methods are far from meeting the needs of the new situation. We have been trying to explore an effective leadership method that can more deeply lead production, more effectively carry out work, and better improve the political and theoretical level of cadres. These articles published in the People's Daily have precisely solved the problems that have not been solved for a long time and found the right way to further improve leadership methods.

Through study, combined with the specific situation of our county, we studied the specific methods for promoting the "Two-Five System," and made "Several Specific Regulations on Further Improving Leadership Methods." Combining this with current production, we used the county newspaper, radio station, and various meetings to vigorously publicize the experience of the Wuqiao County Party Committee's "Two-Five System" leadership method and the great significance of implementing this method throughout the county, launching a campaign of "Learn from Wuqiao, Catch up with Wuqiao, and Surpass Wuqiao in Leadership Methods" among party committees at all levels and all cadres with lightning speed.

At the same time, we hope that the Party newspaper will publish more articles like this in the future.

### “二五制”领导方法给我们的启发

　　“二五制”领导方法给我们的启发
    6月16日人民日报发表了“河北推广‘二五制’领导方法”的消息和社论以后，县委立即组织县委常委、县级机关各部门负责人和公社党委第一书记进行了学习，大家学习了这些文章以后，一致认为启发很深，收获很大。
    长期以来，特别是大跃进以来，我县各级干部深深感到，形势发展很快，领导作风和领导方法远远不能适应新的形势的需要，一直想探索一种能够更深入地领导生产，更有成效地进行工作，更好地提高干部的政治理论水平的行之有效的领导方法。人民日报发表的这些文章恰好为我们从根本上解决了长时期以来所没有解决的问题，找到了进一步改进领导方法的正确途径。
    通过学习，结合我县的具体情况，研究了推广“二五制”的具体办法，作出了“关于进一步改进领导方法的若干具体规定”，并结合当前生产，通过县报、广播站和各种会议，在全县范围内大张旗鼓地宣传了吴桥县委“二五制”领导方法的经验和实行这种方法的重大意义，以雷厉风行之势，在各级党委和全体干部中开展了“学吴桥、赶吴桥、领导方法超吴桥”的运动。
    同时，我们希望党报今后多发表这样的文章。
