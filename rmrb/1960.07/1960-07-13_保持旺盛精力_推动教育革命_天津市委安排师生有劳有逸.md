　　Maintaining Vigorous Energy, Promoting Educational Revolution
　　Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Arranges for Teachers and Students to Have Work and Rest
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to school work and cares about the growth of young students. It has convened many meetings to study how to properly arrange work and rest for teachers and students, further promoting the development of the education revolution.
    Since the beginning of this semester, the educational work in Tianjin has been in a situation of continuous great leaps forward, great revolutions, and great improvements. Similar to the situation on the industrial, agricultural, and financial and trade fronts, the current situation on the education front is very good. In this situation where teachers universally request to teach more and teach well, and students universally request to learn more and learn well, some schools inevitably have situations where students have excessive study burdens, too many social activities, and insufficient sleep time. The Municipal Party Committee promptly discovered this situation and quickly studied the issue of arranging work and rest in schools. Leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee went to universities, middle schools, and primary schools to inspect students' learning and living conditions, and the issue of arranging students' work and rest was specifically studied at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee. Meetings of secretaries of district committees, school party committees, and leading cadres of education departments were convened to analyze the specific situation of the schools, instructing leading cadres of education departments at the municipal and district levels to not only care about the learning and work of teachers and students but also to always care about their physical health, and to conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instructions to young students to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work." The study, work, and rest of teachers and students must adhere to the principles of having both work and rest, combining work and rest, and having both large collectives and small freedoms, and be properly arranged. The Municipal Party Committee pointed out that cadres in the education system must also learn to grasp both teaching and life. Properly arranging work and rest is to enable teachers and students to maintain vigorous energy, continue to leap forward, and ensure the in-depth development of the education revolution.
    Based on the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, district committees and education bureaus have taken active measures to arrange students' learning and life, and have clarified that improving teaching quality must start with improving teaching content, teaching methods, and teaching organization, paying attention to the overall care of students' growth. The method of simply increasing class hours for students, assigning too much homework, and holding examinations and tests is inappropriate. In terms of life, the previously stipulated system of study, sleep, and rest must be strictly enforced. Primary school students are guaranteed nine to ten hours of sleep per day, middle school students are guaranteed eight to nine hours of sleep per day, and university students are guaranteed no less than eight hours of sleep per day. Currently, the lunch break time in middle and primary schools in various districts has been guaranteed and extended to seventy minutes. In order to ensure students' sleep time, Twenty-sixth Middle School also mobilized parents to help and supervise students to go to bed and wake up on time. In addition, the schools also organized medical personnel to study and adjust the lighting settings in classrooms and appropriately increase the wattage, and adjust students' seats to prevent students' eye diseases and cultivate good habits.
    While vigorously improving teaching, reducing students' burdens, and improving teaching quality, the number of class hours for students is appropriately controlled and reduced. Currently, middle schools have no more than thirty class hours per week, senior grades of primary schools have no more than twenty-eight hours, and junior grades of primary schools have no more than twenty-four hours, giving students more self-study time. The amount of homework is appropriate, so that homework can play a role in reviewing and consolidating knowledge. The examination system is improved, and the school leadership uniformly controls examination activities. At the same time, students are helped to improve their learning methods and improve their learning efficiency.
    Schools also pay attention to the work and rest of teachers. At present, meetings have been generally streamlined, and unnecessary social activities for teachers have been reduced, so that teachers have sufficient time to prepare lessons and improve teaching quality. (Attached picture)

　　保持旺盛精力　推动教育革命
　　天津市委安排师生有劳有逸
    本报讯　中共天津市委十分重视学校工作，关心青少年学生的成长，多次召开会议，研究妥善安排师生的劳逸问题，进一步推动了教育革命的发展。
    今年开学以来，天津市的教育工作是连续大跃进、大革命、大提高的形势。和工业、农业、财贸战线上的情况一样，当前教育战线的形势很好。在这教师普遍要求多教、教好，学生普遍要求多学、学好的情况下，有些学校难免出现一些学生学习负担过重，社会活动太多，睡眠时间不足的情况。市委及时发现了这种情况，迅速研究了学校劳逸的安排问题。市委的负责干部分赴大学、中学和小学视察了学生学习和生活情况，并在市委常委会上对学生劳逸安排问题专门作了研究，并分别召集区委、学校党委的书记和教育部门领导干部的会议，分析了学校的具体情况，指示市、区各级教育部门领导干部，不仅要关心学校师生的学习和工作，而且还要时刻关心他们的身体健康，认真贯彻毛主席对于青年学生提出的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示。对于师生的学习、工作和休息必须坚持有劳有逸，劳逸结合，和既有大集体、又有小自由的原则，妥善地加以安排。市委指出，教育系统的干部也要学会一手抓教学，一手抓生活。妥善安排劳逸，是为了使师生保持旺盛精力，持续跃进，保证教育革命的深入发展。
    各区委、教育局，根据市委指示，都采取了积极措施，安排学生学习和生活，并明确了提高教学质量，必须从改进教学内容、教学方法和教学组织入手，注意全面关心学生的成长，那种采用单纯地给学生增加学时、过多的留作业和举行考试测验的办法是不妥当的。在生活方面，要严格执行过去早已规定了的学习、睡眠和休息的制度。小学生保证每天睡眠九小时至十小时，中学生保证每天睡眠八小时至九小时，大学生每天的睡眠时间保证不少于八小时。目前各区的中小学午睡时间已有保证，并延长到七十分钟。二十六中学为了保证学生睡眠时间，还发动了家长，帮助和督促学生按时作息。此外，各校还组织医护人员研究调整教室灯光的设置和适当增加度数，调整学生座位，以防止学生的眼病，并培养学生良好的习惯。
    在大力改进教学，减轻学生负担，提高教学质量的同时，适当控制和减少学生上课的时数，目前中学每周上课不超过三十小时，小学高年级不超过二十八小时，小学低年级不超过二十四小时，使学生有较多的自习时间。作业分量适当，使作业能起到复习、巩固知识的作用。改进考试制度，由学校领导统一掌握考试活动。同时帮助学生改进学习方法，提高学习效率。
    各校也很注意教师的劳逸问题。目前，都普遍精简了会议，减少教师不必要的社会活动，使教师有充分时间备课，提高教学质量。（附图片）
