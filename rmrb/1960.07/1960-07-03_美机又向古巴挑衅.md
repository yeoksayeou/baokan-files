Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 1st - According to a report in "Revolution" today, on the afternoon of June 30th, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier was discovered engaging in conspiratorial activities approximately fifteen nautical miles off the coast of Santiago, Cuba. Subsequently, two jet aircraft took off from this aircraft carrier and circled over the port of Santiago, particularly over the area where the U.S. Texaco refinery, which was recently taken over for failing to comply with Cuban law, is located.

"Revolution" said that the appearance of the U.S. aircraft carrier and the flight of two U.S. aircraft in Cuban airspace is a new provocation and yet another infringement upon Cuban national sovereignty.

    美机又向古巴挑衅
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　据“革命报”今天报道，在6月30日下午，发现美国海军的一艘航空母舰在距古巴圣地亚哥海岸大约十五浬的水面进行阴谋活动。随后就有两架喷气式飞机从这艘航空母舰上起飞，到圣地亚哥港上空盘旋飞行，特别是在日前由于不履行古巴法律而被接管的美国德士古炼油厂所在地区上空飞行。
    “革命报”说，美国航空母舰的出现以及两架美国飞机在古巴领空的飞行是一个新的挑衅，是又一次侵犯古巴国家主权。
