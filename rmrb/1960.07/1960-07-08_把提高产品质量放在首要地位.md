Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangzhou Zhongxi Scientific Instrument Factory has achieved an all-round leap forward in production by continuously improving product quality. The factory's production plan for the first half of this year was overfulfilled by 70.3% on June 25th, an increase of 58.7% compared to the same period last year. In terms of product quality, the pass rate for cement testing instruments reached 100%; for electrical instruments, the national requirement is 92%, but the actual rate reached 96.7%; for thermal instruments, the national requirement is 94%, while the actual rate reached 97.2%. In the first half of the year, the factory's labor productivity increased by 100% compared to the same period last year.

	The Zhongxi Scientific Instrument Factory was formed in 1956 by the merger of more than twenty small factories and individual handicraftsmen. In the two years following the merger, a blind pursuit of output value led to poor product quality, high costs, and significant waste. At that time, the cement testing instruments produced generally failed to meet national requirements, and users frequently requested returns. From that point on, the entire factory resolved to emulate the advanced Changchun Instrument Factory, launching a mass movement to "Learn from Changchun, Catch up with Changchun," and putting forward the battle cry of "Work hard for a year to catch up with Changchun in cost and quality." The factory leadership mobilized the masses to present facts, calculate accounts, discuss ideas, and offer suggestions. They fiercely criticized the thinking that focused solely on output value and the conservative idea of blaming simple equipment. This rapidly changed the enterprise's production outlook, continuously reduced product costs, and significantly improved quality, resulting in orders pouring in from all over the country. Improved product quality also drove an increase in product output. Currently, the factory's production of cement testing instruments has increased from more than two hundred units per year in the past to more than three thousand four hundred units per year; instrument production has increased from more than two hundred units per year to forty thousand units. In addition, they have successfully tested more than twenty new products, many of which are relatively advanced precision instruments. Due to their outstanding achievements in production, the factory has successively won twenty-eight red flags and thirty-four certificates of merit from the province, city, and district, and attended the National Conference of Heroes.

	Since 1958, the Party organization of the Zhongxi Scientific Instrument Factory has consistently placed the improvement of product quality as a top priority in its daily leadership work. It frequently uses the clear slogan of "Guarantee output on the premise of improving quality" to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, so that the masses try every means to improve product quality. Of the more than 300 advanced experiences promoted throughout the factory in the first half of this year, 80% revolved around improving product quality. These experiences have now been incorporated into the process regulations.

	In the work of improving product quality, the Zhongxi Scientific Instrument Factory not only conducts in-depth ideological education for workers, but also tries every means to improve their technical level. In the early stage of "Learning from Changchun, Catching up with Changchun," the factory leadership published the parts processing drawings of the Changchun Instrument Factory for workers to study and use. Later, it was discovered that newly recruited workers could not even understand the drawings, so a "wipe out drawing illiteracy" campaign was launched throughout the factory. According to the requirements for processing different parts, simple symbols were marked on the drawings, making them clear to new workers at a glance. On this basis, the factory also opened technical courses, using spare time to explain the uses, performance, structure, and metalworking principles of products to workers. Many workers rapidly improved their technical level after short-term study. From 1958 to the present, the Party organization of the Zhongxi Scientific Instrument Factory has also sent more than ten batches of cadres and workers to factories in the same industry in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places to study quality inspection methods and improve the enterprise's quality management system, focusing on the central task of improving product quality. In addition, the factory frequently sends "three-way combination" groups composed of cadres, technicians, and workers to actively visit user units, listen to their opinions, and improve the factory's products accordingly.

### 把提高产品质量放在首要地位

    把提高产品质量放在首要地位
    广州中西科学仪器厂经常进行重视质量的思想教育
    学习先进经验，开办技术课程，提高工人的技术水平
    据新华社广州电　广州市中西科学仪器厂，在不断提高产品质量的基础上，获得了生产的全面跃进。这个厂今年上半年的产品产量计划，已经在6月25日超额70.3％完成，比去年同期增长58.7％。在产品质量方面，水泥试验仪器的合格率达到100％；电工仪表的合格率，国家要求为92％，实际达到96.7％；热工仪表的合格率，国家要求为94％，实际达到97.2％。上半年，这个厂的劳动生产率比去年同期增长一倍。
      中西科学仪器厂是1956年由二十多家小工厂和个体手工业者组成的，合营以后的两年多内，曾经由于盲目追求产值，造成了产品质量差、成本高、浪费大的局面。那时，生产的水泥试验仪器一般都达不到国家要求，用户买去后纷纷要求退货。从那时起，全厂职工就立志以先进单位长春仪器厂为目标，掀起了“学长春、赶长春”的群众运动，提出“苦战一年，成本质量赶上长春”的战斗口号。工厂领导方面发动群众摆事实、算细账、谈思想、献计策，狠狠地批判了单纯追求产值的思想和光责怪设备简陋的保守思想，使企业的生产面貌迅速改观，产品成本不断降低，质量也大大改进，全国各地都纷纷来信订货。由于产品质量提高，也带动了产品产量的增长。现在，这个厂的水泥试验仪器的产量已经由过去的年产二百多台，增长到年产三千四百多台；仪表产量更从年产二百多件增长到四万件。另外，他们还试验成功了二十多种新产品，其中有不少是较高级的精密仪表。因为生产上的突出成就，这个厂先后获得了省、市、区的二十八面红旗，三十四幅奖状，并出席了全国群英会。
    1958年以来，中西科学仪器厂的党组织，在日常领导工作中，一贯把提高产品质量放在首要地位，经常用“在提高质量的前提下保证产量”的鲜明口号调动群众的积极性，使群众千方百计地改进产品质量。今年上半年，全厂推广的三百多项先进经验中，有80％是围绕着提高产品质量的。现在，这些经验已经纳入工艺规程。
    中西科学仪器厂在提高产品质量的工作中，除对工人进行深入的思想教育以外，还千方百计地提高他们的技术水平。在“学长春、赶长春”初期，工厂领导方面曾把长春仪器厂的零件加工图纸公布出来，供工人们学习、运用。后来发现新进厂的工人连图纸也看不懂，于是就在全厂开展了“扫图盲”运动，根据对加工不同零件的要求，用简单的符号在图纸上标明，使新工人一目了然。这个厂还在这一基础上，开办了技术课程，利用业余时间给工人讲解产品的用途、性能、结构和金工原理，很多工人经过短期学习，都迅速提高了技术水平。从1958年到现在，中西科学仪器厂的党组织还围绕提高产品质量这一中心任务，先后派出十多批干部和工人到上海、北京等地的同行业工厂学习质量检验办法，健全企业的质量管理制度。另外，厂里也经常派出由干部、技术人员、工人组成的“三结合”小组，主动访问使用单位。听取他们的意见，据以改进本厂的产品。
