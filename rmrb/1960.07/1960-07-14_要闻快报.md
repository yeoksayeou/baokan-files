	Magang Focuses on Conserving Mineral Resources
	While vigorously increasing the production and transportation of ore, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company is making great efforts to conserve mineral resources, resulting in a significant improvement in ore utilization. Currently, the company can utilize ore and ore powder of different specifications and grades for iron smelting, thus continuously reducing ore consumption. For example, the average ore consumption per ton of iron produced in the Iron Smelting Plant No. 1 in June decreased by 93 kilograms compared to May.
	
	Workers Self-Compile Technological Regulations
	Fushun Coal Mining Machinery Factory mobilized the masses to compile technological regulations. Currently, the factory has compiled more than 3,800 new technological regulations. In June, due to the incorporation of a large number of new technologies into the regulations, production efficiency increased by 26.3% compared to May, and product quality improved by 7.5%. The workers' self-compiled new technological regulations have greatly reduced production steps and processes, simplified many products, shortened production cycles, improved quality, and reduced materials and equipment. The casting workshop uses self-compiled new technology to produce "large tank car wheels," completing 117 hours of work in six hours.
	
	Hunan Massively Produces Fiberboard
	Hunan Province is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of wood with fiberboard as the center, establishing artificial board factories and forest chemical plants on a large scale, and actively promoting advanced experiences in saving and substituting wood. This year, the province has established more than 3,800 artificial fiberboard factories and forest chemical plants, saving more than 80,000 cubic meters of wood.
	
	Tianjin Launches Campaign to Learn From, Catch Up With, and Surpass Advanced Indicators
	In Tianjin, more than 90% of factory Party committee secretaries and factory directors have gone to the front line of production to lead production in a down-to-earth manner. After the leading cadres went to the front line, they launched a mass campaign to learn from, catch up with, and surpass national advanced indicators. Currently, a competition upsurge has formed in various industries to strive for national or city firsts in five aspects: quality, output, and reduced consumption.
	
	Good Living Leads to High Production Enthusiasm
	The Party organization of the Guanyinxi Iron Factory's Liziya Iron Mine in Yuechi County, Sichuan, comprehensively cares for the lives of employees, ensuring sustained leaps in production. Now, the mine has achieved an average of one pig for every two and a half people, one sheep for every two people, and three ducks for every person, while also planting more than 100 mu of vegetables. In terms of housing, they all live in brick and tile houses built by themselves; and various service organizations such as sewing and laundry have been established to facilitate the masses. Everyone has work and rest, and a new situation of a large reduction in personnel and increased production has emerged. From January to June this year, compared with the same period last year, the number of employees in the mine decreased by 34%, while the daily ore production level increased by 150%, and the cost per ton of ore also dropped from 11 yuan to 3.5 yuan.
	
	Mechanization of Bundling Large Volume Materials Achieved
	Twenty-five material dispatch stations along the railway in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of bundling, loading, and unloading of large-volume, lightweight materials; three stations have also achieved continuous bundling, handling, and loading. Labor efficiency has increased by three to thirteen times, and the load capacity of freight cars has increased by 50% to 70%. This year, more than 4,000 freight cars can be saved, saving more than 300,000 yuan in expenses.
	
	Production Materials Universal Service Department
	Chongqing Hardware, Electrical Appliances and Materials Company has established a production materials universal service department, carrying out business activities in eight service projects, including adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, renting tools, coordinating repairs and parts, purchasing and selling on consignment, handling transportation on behalf of customers, door-to-door delivery, finding drawings, and introducing training. The production materials universal service department adopts the method of "one network, two combinations" to carry out work to serve production.
	"One network" means establishing a production universal cooperation network: setting up a group of universal service personnel within the service department; and hiring relevant factories as universal cooperative factories, and the purchasers of factories and mines as universal cooperative personnel. "Two combinations" means combining universal service personnel with store purchasers and salespersons; and combining with industrial, agricultural, commercial, and transportation departments to twist into a rope from the inside to the outside.
	
	Five-Side Rapid Ship Repair Method
	Changde County Transportation People's Commune in Hunan Province created the "five-side one-stop rapid ship repair method," achieving major repairs of wooden sailboats in no more than two days, medium repairs in no more than one shift, and minor repairs and oiling without stopping navigation. "Five sides" means: scraping the boat, patching, caulking, oiling, and baking, all done simultaneously. Adopting this rapid ship repair method can increase ship repair work efficiency by more than eight times. In order to break through the "drying oil" barrier, recently, workers Zhou Haiqing, Ding Tianqing, and others have also created an "active blower drying oil machine," further accelerating the ship repair progress.

专栏：要闻快报

    马钢狠抓节约用矿
    马鞍山钢铁公司在狠抓矿石增产与调运的同时，大力节约用矿，使矿石利用率获得显著提高。目前这个公司已能做到不同规格、不同品位的矿石和矿粉都能入炉炼铁，因而矿石的消耗量不断下降。如炼铁一厂6月份平均每炼一吨铁的矿石消耗比5月份降低九十三公斤。
      工人自编工艺规程
    抚顺煤矿机械厂发动群众编写工艺规程，目前，全厂已编出三千八百多件新工艺规程。6月份由于大量新工艺纳入规程，生产效率比5月份提高26.3％，产品质量提高7.5％。工人自编新工艺规程，大大缩减了生产工序和工艺流程，许多产品由繁变简，生产周期由长变短，质量提高，材料、设备减少。铸工车间在用自编的新工艺作“大槽车轮”活件，六小时就完成了一百一十七小时的工作量。
      湖南大造纤维板
    湖南省大搞以纤维板为中心的木材综合利用，大办人造板厂和林产化工厂，并积极推广节约和代用木材的先进经验。今年来，全省已办起人造纤维板厂和林产化工厂三千八百多个，共节约木材八万多立方米。
　  天津掀起学赶超先进指标运动
    天津市已有90％以上的工厂党委书记、厂长深入到生产第一线，扎扎实实地领导生产。领导干部深入第一线以后，大抓学、赶、超全国先进指标的群众运动。目前各行各业力争质量、产量、降低消耗等五个方面夺取全国或全市第一的竞赛热潮已经形成。
    生活搞得好生产情绪高
    四川岳池县观音溪铁厂李子垭铁矿党组织全面关心职工生活，保证生产持续跃进。现在，这个矿已做到平均每两个半人有一头猪，两个人有一只羊，一个人有三只鸭，同时还种了一百多亩蔬菜。居住方面也都住上了自己动手建筑的砖瓦平房；并成立了缝纫、洗衣等各种便利群众的服务组织。人人有劳有逸，生产上出现了人员大减，生产加番的新局面，今年1至6月份和去年同期比较，全矿职工人数减少34％，而矿石日产水平却提高了150％，每吨矿石的成本也由十一元下降到三元五角。
  　实现体积大的物资捆包机械化
　  吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州铁路沿线的二十五个物资发运站，对体积大质量轻的物资，实现了捆包装卸机械化、半机械化；三个站还实现了捆包搬运、装车连续化。提高劳动效率三倍到十三倍，提高货车载重量50％到70％，今年可节省车皮四千多个，节省费用三十多万元。
      生产资料万能服务部
    重庆五金交电器材公司建立了生产资料万能服务部，开展调剂有无、租赁工具、协作修配、代购代销、代办运输、送货上门、寻找图样、介绍培训等八个服务项目的业务活动。生产资料万能服务部采取“一网、二结合”的办法，开展为生产服务的工作。
  “一网”即建立生产万能协作网：在服务部内部设立一批万能服务员；再聘请有关的厂为万能协作厂，厂矿的采购员为万能协作员。“二结合”即万能服务员与商店采购员、营业员结合；与工业、农业、商业、交通部门相结合，从内部到外部拧成一股绳。
        五边快速修船法
    湖南省常德县运输人民公社创造“五边一条龙快速修船法”，做到木帆船大修不过两天，中修不过班，小修油修不停航。“五边”，即：边刮船、边补、边捻缝、边打油、边烘烤。采取这种快速修船法，可提高修船工效八倍多。为了突破“干油”关，最近，工人周海清、丁天青等又制成了“活动鼓风干油机”，进一步加快了修船进度。
