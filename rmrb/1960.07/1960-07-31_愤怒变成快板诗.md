    Anger Turned into Clapper Rhyme
    Wang Lao Jiu
    The American imperialist jackals are plagues, hated wherever they go, killing and setting fires everywhere, opening their bloody mouths wanting to eat people. When I, Old Wang, hear this, my heart fills with anger, I am determined to skin them alive, though I am too old to go to the front line, I will take up my pen as a weapon. My anger turns into a clapper rhyme, like bullets flying all over the sky, bullets bloom and blast down mountains, even more powerful than an atomic bomb. American imperialist devils, I warn you, quickly get out of Asia and Africa, if you dare to be arrogant and challenge us again, our heroes will not spare you. Now we have Chairman Mao, China is not to be trifled with. People of the world unite, destroying you will be as easy as wiping out ants.

    愤怒变成快板诗
    王老九美帝豺狼是瘟神，走到哪里哪里恨，到处杀人放恶火，大张血口想吃人。我老王听言心生气，定要活剥他狗皮，年老不能上火线，拿上钢笔作武器。愤怒变成快板诗，好像子弹满天飞，子弹开花轰倒山，更比原子弹有力。美帝鬼子警告你，快从亚洲非洲滚出去，若再猖狂挑战争，我们的英雄不饶你。如今有我们毛主席，中国不是好惹的。全世界人民团结起，消灭你犹如抹蚂蚁。
