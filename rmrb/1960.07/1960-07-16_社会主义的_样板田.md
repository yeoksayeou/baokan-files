    Socialist "Exemplary Fields"
　　Xu Haiting, Secretary of the Communist Party of China Hubei Shishou Tuanshan Commune Committee
    The Youth Shock Brigade of the Rocket Production Team of Tuanshan People's Commune in Shishou County, Hubei Province, has begun singing a new folk song:
        Talking about farming, singing about farming,
        Our farming is like that of the gods,
        If you ask what kind of fields we're farming?
        Socialist "exemplary fields."
    In these midsummer days, standing on the newly built Fanjiabridge and looking around, what unfolds before people's eyes is a brand-new blueprint. In just one month, this lake depression—Fanjia Dyke—which is about a thousand mu in size and could not be fully harvested in previous years, has been transformed into garden fields. Two central canals, four meters wide at the bottom and 1,800 meters long, divide this land into four square grids. Extending from both sides of the canals are eight-meter-wide avenues. Along the sides of the roads are newly planted small poplar trees. Each grid is about 300 mu in area, and after renovation, it is further divided into thirty-eight rectangular garden fields of varying sizes of ten, twenty, and thirty mu. Around the main ditch and on the right side of the fields, there are specially dug drainage and irrigation ditches. At the northern end of the dyke, there is a 32-horsepower water pump dedicated to irrigating Fanjia Dyke. The newly built Fanjia Sluice at the southern end can directly connect to the Tuanshan River, ensuring smooth drainage. Boats shuttle back and forth in the canals; double-wheeled carts and ox-drawn carts loaded with fertilizer creak along the avenues. Growing here are patches of medium rice seedlings, lush and verdant, like green carpets spread out there. How can people not be overjoyed at such a sign of a good harvest!
    Under the leadership of the Party, the entire cadre and masses of Tuanshan Commune, to change the situation here of "waterlogging when it rains, drought when it doesn't, extensive planting with meager harvests, and relying on the heavens for food," went all out last winter and this spring, cutting three mountains in half, severing five ridges horizontally, and connecting seven lakes, opening up the Red Flag, Construction, and Happiness Canals, which are over a hundred li long and twelve meters wide at the bottom. Subsequently, thirty-one large, medium, and small-sized ditches were built, initially forming a river network. In March of this year, the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee held a spring plowing and sowing on-site meeting here. Comrade Liang Jiurang, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee Secretariat, who presided over the meeting, encouraged the Commune Party Committee to establish a high-level garden field as a direction for the future. The Prefectural Committee's instructions were warmly supported at the Party Committee meeting. All the members of the Rocket Production Team were also overjoyed to hear this news. However, when it was decided to establish this high-level garden field in Fanhu Depression—Fanjia Dyke—some people felt that it should not be chosen in such a backward area.
    However, the majority of people believed that although Fanjia Dyke was a large lake wasteland, people called it "Thunder Yell Hill" and "Gong Beating Dyke," meaning that when thunder rumbled, gongs had to be beaten to drain the waterlogged area, but it also had an "arrogant" temper of "the sun comes out, the carts clang," that is, drought required carting water for irrigation after only two or three days of sunshine. Therefore, at the call of the Commune Party Committee, the entire commune quickly formed five shock companies and two combat teams, with about a thousand strong soldiers and valiant generals, massively and mightily spread across the entire lake wasteland of Fanjia Dyke.
    Leveling such an uneven place as Fanjia Dyke was indeed difficult. At the lower end of the dyke, there was Liujia Mountain, which protruded five or six meters above the ground. The soil was as hard as iron; not to mention using iron shovels, even improved tools could not subdue this dead yellow earth. However, there are no difficulties before heroes. Comrade Xu Dingquan, the commune's famous water conservancy hero, led five young men from the East Wind Shock Brigade to plant the red flag on the top of the mountain. Everyone stood under the red flag and raised their hands to swear: "Fight Liujia Mountain, level Fanjia Dyke, greatly reform tools, triple work efficiency, mud boats, soil harrows, and wooden rails, each person's work efficiency triples eightfold, determined to break through difficulties, must turn dead soil!" They gathered tools such as digging hoes, deep plows, and soil harrows and started working together, opening mountains and chiseling walls. Two wooden rails, more than forty meters long, were laid to the center of the lake, and wooden rail cars like trains ran on the rails. In such a difficult work section, work efficiency quickly increased to eighteen cubic meters of earth, four times higher than before. In a short ten days, the more than 1,280 cubic meters of earth on the hill were leveled.
    Difficulties were thus tamed one by one by the people. Under the leadership of the East Wind Shock Brigade, in the process of leveling the land, a total of 1,747 new tools such as mud boats and mud shovels were promoted, greatly improving work efficiency. In just thirty days, the entire project task was completed, filling in more than twenty low-lying areas, leveling six high protrusions and three ridges, completing a total of 113,600 cubic meters of earth.
    Recently, the Commune Party Committee organized more than 300 cadres and commune members to visit here. Everyone praised it highly, calling it a garden field "flower" (transformation). It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a flower. Such flowers will bloom in every corner of Tuanshan and spread throughout every corner of the motherland.

### 社会主义的“样板田”

    社会主义的“样板田”
　　中共湖北石首团山公社委员会书记　徐海艇
    湖北省石首县团山人民公社火箭生产队的青年突击组，唱起了一首新的民歌：
        说种田，唱种田，
        我们种田赛神仙，
        要问我们种的什么田？
        社会主义的“样板田”。
    在这仲夏的日子里，站在新建起来的范家桥上向四面了望，展现在人们眼前的是一幅崭新的蓝图。仅仅是一个月的时间，这个约有千亩大而过去常年不能全收的湖塌——范家垸，已经变成了园田。两条底宽四米，长达一千八百米的中心渠道，把这块土地隔成了四块正方形的格盘。渠道两旁伸展着八米宽的大道。沿着路的两边，是刚栽下不久的小杨柳。每个方格的面积有三百亩左右，经过整修以后、又在这里面划分为十亩、二十亩、三十亩大小不等的三十八块长方格子式的园田。主沟的周围和田的右侧，开得有专门排灌的沟，垸子的北头有一台三十二马力的抽水机，专供范家垸灌溉用。南端新建的范家闸可直通团山河，排泄也很畅通。渠道里，穿梭的船只在来往划行；大道上有满载肥料的双轮车和牛拉板车在吱呀吱呀的行走。这里生长的是一片片的中稻禾苗，葱绿茁壮，好似一床床的绿毯铺在那里。这种丰收的预兆，叫人心里怎么不乐开花啊！
    团山公社在党的领导下，全体干部群众为了改变这里的“有雨就渍，无雨就旱，广种薄收，靠天吃饭”的面貌，去冬今春，一鼓作气，腰斩三座山，横断五重岭，串通七个湖，开出了底宽十二米，长达一百多里的红旗、建设、幸福三大渠道。接着，又修建了大、中、小型沟渠三十一条，初步形成了河网。今年3月间，荆州地委在这里召开了春耕播种现场会，主持会议的地委书记处书记梁久让同志鼓励公社党委办一块高级的园田，作为今后的方向。地委的指示在党委会上得到了热烈的拥护。火箭生产队的全体社员听到这个消息后，也无不欢欣鼓舞。但是，决定把这块高级园田办在范湖塌——范家垸的时候，有人认为不应该选在这样落后的地方。
    可是，大多数人却认为：范家垸虽然是个大湖荒，人们称它为“雷喊丘”、“打锣垸”，意思说：雷声一轰就要打锣排渍，但它也有着“太阳出，车子响”的傲性脾气，那就是晴得两三天就要架车抗旱。因此，公社党委一声号召，全社迅速地组成了五个突击连、两个战斗组，约有一千名壮兵猛将，浩浩荡荡地布满了范家垸的整个湖荒。
    像范家垸这样高低不平的地方，平整起来的确是有困难的。垸子的下半头，有一座凸出地面五、六米高的刘家山，土质硬得似铁，不说用铁锹，就是改良工具也无法制服这块死黄土。但是，英雄面前无困难，全社著名的水利英雄徐鼎全同志领导着东风突击组的五个小伙子把红旗插上了山顶。大家站在红旗下面举手宣誓：“大战刘家山，填平范家垸，工具大改革，工效翻三番，泥船土耖木轨化，每人工效三个八，决心突难关，定要死土把身翻。”他们集中了挖锄、深耕犁、土耖子等工具，一齐动手，开山凿壁。两条四十多米长的木轨铺到了湖心，像火车一样的木轨车在轨道上奔跑。在这样困难工段上，工效迅速提到十八公方土，比原来翻了四番。在短短十天的时间内，一千二百八十多方土的山岗被削平了。
    重重的困难就这样被人们一个一个地驯服了。在东风突击组的带领下，在平整土地当中，共推广了泥船、泥锹等新工具一千七百四十七件，大大地提高了工作效率，在短短的三十天中完成了整个工程任务，共填满了二十多个低洼，削平了六个高凸和三条岗，共完成了十一万三千六百方土。
    最近公社党委组织了三百多名干部、社员到这里参观，大家都赞不绝口，把它称为园田“花”（化）。说它是一枝花，一点也不过分。这样的花将会开满团山的每一个角落，开遍祖国的每一个角落。
