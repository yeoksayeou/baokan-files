The Production and Construction Corps in Xinjiang
Zhang Zhonghan, Deputy Minister of Agricultural Reclamation, Deputy Political Commissar of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps

　　“Fighting, production, learning, and doing mass work,” “being both a fighting force and a production force, and also a working force.” This is an important foundation and a glorious symbol of the military thinking of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　During the arduous revolutionary war period, our army not only engaged in heroic battles, but also devoted themselves to selfless labor, self-sufficient production, and socialist construction, inspiring the people's enthusiasm for production, so that the people and their army shared weal and woe, persisted in fighting, and strived for revolutionary victory. When our revolution achieved complete victory and the people of the whole country turned to socialist construction, a large number of veteran soldiers were collectively transferred to the struggle to conquer nature. While going all out to engage in peaceful construction, they were also a hundred times more vigilant against imperialist warmongers. Revolutionary practice and construction practice have repeatedly shown how the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong have outstandingly and creatively handled the relationship between combat and production in wartime, and correctly handled the relationship between national defense construction and economic construction in the construction period. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is a part of the collective transfer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is a team that combines labor and military affairs, has a high degree of organization and discipline, rich combat experience, and a high degree of political consciousness. It is a shock force on the national economic construction front in Xinjiang, especially on the agricultural reclamation construction front. It is a proletarian internationalist team that wholeheartedly serves the people of all ethnic groups and strives for socialism and communism.

　　In the late autumn of 1949, Xinjiang declared peaceful liberation. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, set off a high tide of production in water conservancy construction, wasteland reclamation, agricultural development, animal husbandry, and processing of sideline industries with the force of a swift wind and thunder. In 1950 alone, the Xinjiang Military Region troops used simple manual farm tools to reclaim more than 600,000 mu of wasteland, creating a brilliant record of reclamation. Subsequently, all officers and soldiers built the first batch of modern industries in Xinjiang by saving money on food and clothing and economizing on military expenses. All these miraculous and rapidly developing production and construction undertakings are undoubtedly the earliest leap-forward development of socialist construction in Xinjiang. The liberated people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, under the leadership of the Party and under the influence and encouragement of the hard work of the People's Liberation Army, also launched an unprecedented large-scale production campaign. The face of Xinjiang began to undergo a historical and tremendous change.

　　In order to both strengthen the modernization training of national defense forces and better develop production, in 1952, in accordance with the instructions of the Military Commission, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, except for a part that was formed into national defense forces, was reorganized into several agricultural construction divisions and engineering construction divisions. Subsequently, in 1954, these construction divisions were merged to form the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. A joint production army including industry, agriculture, military affairs, education, commerce, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery was born in a brand-new form.

　　Ten years of experience have proved that in Xinjiang, where the population is sparse, the land is vast, and ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, the form of the Production and Construction Corps (which has always maintained the organizational form of the army's divisions, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads) is not only the best way to carry out construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, but also the best way for the central government to support local areas and the Han people to support fraternal minority nationalities. The Production and Construction Corps has always conformed to the spirit and system of "military organization, combat action, collective life, and democratic management." It maintains the organizational form of the army, which can better inherit and carry forward this tradition. The essence of this tradition is: to seize the time, overcome difficulties, and create conditions. This is precisely the noble qualities and lofty communist style of the People's Army, which is brave, tenacious, agile, active, despises difficulties, and is always ready to overcome difficulties. It is also the qualities and style necessary for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

　　Now, it is already the eleventh year. Under the direct leadership of the Central Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Production and Construction Corps is striding forward along the victorious road instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. By this year, the total cultivated area of the entire Corps is approximately equivalent to 88% of the total cultivated area of Xinjiang in 1949; the sown area is equivalent to 62% of the total sown area of Xinjiang in 1949; the irrigation area increased by water conservancy projects is equivalent to 150% of the total irrigation area of Xinjiang in 1949; the livestock owned is equivalent to 12.8% of the total livestock of Xinjiang in 1949; the total industrial output value is equivalent to seventy-seven times that of Xinjiang in 1949. Other undertakings such as construction engineering, transportation, finance and trade, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also made considerable progress. In addition to these directly managed economic undertakings, it always regards accepting the most arduous construction tasks of the Autonomous Region as its glorious and unshirkable responsibility. To name just a few major ones, the soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps have stepped forward and contributed their labor to the construction of the main industrial infrastructure projects of the Autonomous Region over the years, such as the dangerous Uku Highway crossing the Tianshan Mountains, the vast Karamay Mining Area, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. It can be seen from this that this production force, which is gradually being armed with new agricultural machinery and advanced technology, is increasingly growing into a modernized production and construction corps on the construction front of the Autonomous Region that can be dispatched to the east or the west, and is mobile and tenacious.

　　In the future, the central task facing the Production and Construction Corps is to unite the people of all ethnic groups, improve production, and improve the political and cultural study and militia training of workers and staff under the leadership of the Party. To loyally place ourselves under the leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Party committees at all levels, to be exemplary in supporting the government, to sincerely love the people of all ethnic groups, and to wage a resolute struggle against those who have even the slightest sprouts of pride and complacency, and even the remaining Han chauvinist ideas. Over the past decade, while completing the heavy production and construction tasks it has undertaken, this force has actively and selflessly labored and participated in other socialist construction undertakings. The people of all ethnic groups have unanimously praised the Corps, saying: "Wherever it is most difficult, the Production and Construction Corps is fighting there; wherever the people have difficulties, they can see the hands of the Production and Construction Corps reaching out to help." Although we have achieved certain results, we are not satisfied with this in the slightest. A force armed with proletarian internationalism and Mao Zedong Thought should give the fraternal nationalities, who have suffered historically, the greatest sympathy and sincere respect; regard strengthening national unity and defending national unity as the most important task; and regard rapidly changing the backward social, economic, and cultural conditions of the fraternal minority nationalities as its sacred duty. On the existing basis, we will carry out the movement to do good deeds for the people of all ethnic groups on a larger, deeper, and more lasting scale than ever before, and make more significant achievements, so as to further enhance the fraternal friendship and unbreakable unity between all ethnic groups.

　　Based on the experience and foundation of production and construction over the past decade, it is entirely conceivable that in the next two or three years, we will raise the construction, production, and business management of our state-owned farms to a higher stage and level. By 1962, the requirements are:

　　1. In agriculture: Expand the cultivated area by one time. Further comprehensively, thoroughly, and conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter." For old farms that have been in operation for more than three years, the area of pasture must account for 20% of the total sown area, and every 10,000 mu must have 2,000 head of large and small livestock (pigs, sheep, cattle, horses) and 10,000 poultry (chickens, ducks), so as to combine pasture and farm, and combine animal husbandry teams and production teams, so as to combine agriculture and animal husbandry to the highest extent. The yield per unit area of grain should reach 350 jin (Xinjiang region rarely has double cropping), and the yield per unit area of cotton should reach 100 jin of ginned cotton. Equip every 10,000 mu with five standard tractors, increasing the level of mechanization from the current 66% to 93%, and increasing the current quota of 70 mu managed by workers to 200 mu.

　　2. In water conservancy: Water conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture in Xinjiang. The current utilization rate of 50% of surface water irrigation must be increased to 75%. A large amount of untapped groundwater must be extracted through engineering excavation and the use of drainage and irrigation equipment to serve the expansion of cultivated area. In all water conservancy projects in the future, the comprehensive utilization of irrigation, power generation, and navigation must be fully realized. Not only must every farm have electricity, but also every team must have electricity; not only must ships sail in the main canals, but also ships must sail in the branch canals; all transportation in farms must be carried out by both land and water, and every canal must have ships.

　　3. In landscaping: Farms should be landscaped. Wherever wasteland is reclaimed, trees should be planted. Seedlings should be cultivated in the first year, transplanted in the second year, formed into rows and belts in the third year, and become shaded in the fourth year, so as to achieve landscaping of the entire farm. The Production and Construction Corps will work together with the people of all ethnic groups to strive to green the motherland of Xinjiang.

　　4. Build a national base for agricultural and animal husbandry products: On the basis of further improving labor productivity and increasing the yield per unit area, calculating with eight items including cotton, soybeans, oil crops, pork, beef and mutton, wool, poultry meat, and poultry eggs, by 1962, the comprehensive commodity rate will be increased from the current 45% to 60%.

　　In short, we must implement the correct policy of taking agriculture as the foundation to promote the common leap forward of various undertakings.

　　What a broad and clean white paper Xinjiang is! The Production and Construction Corps will join the people of all ethnic groups in wielding giant pens, writing magnificent poems, and drawing colorful paintings to build Xinjiang, which accounts for one-sixth of China's land, into a beautiful land.

　　While developing production, we will, together with the people of the whole country, respond to the call of the Party, establish militia divisions on a large scale, combine production units and combat units, and use the gaps in each production season to carry out political, cultural, production technical knowledge, and militia training. If the imperialist aggressors dare to invade our sacred socialist motherland, they will find that this is a vast ocean of brave fighting and universal conscription! They will find that none of us have fallen asleep in dreams and lost our vigilance and fighting spirit.

　　On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, the transferred soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps pay tribute to their close comrades-in-arms, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the Party Central Committee! Pay tribute to the great leader and helmsman of victory, Chairman Mao!

    生产建设兵团在新疆
    农垦部副部长  新疆生产建设兵团副政委  张仲瀚
    “打仗、生产、学习、做群众工作”，“既是一个战斗队，又是一个生产队，同时又是一个工作队。”这是中国共产党和毛泽东同志建军思想的重要基础和光辉的标志。
    当在艰苦的革命战争时期，我们的军队都曾经一方面进行着英勇的战斗，一方面进行着忘我的劳动，生产自给，建设社会主义，激发人民群众的生产积极性，从而使人民群众和自己的军队同呼吸、共命运，坚持战斗，争取革命胜利。当我国革命取得彻底胜利，全国人民转入社会主义建设的时候，又将大批久经战斗的军队集体转业，投进了征服自然的斗争。在全力以赴地从事着和平建设的同时，却又百倍警惕地防备着帝国主义战争疯人。革命的实践和建设的实践一再表明：伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志，是怎样杰出地、创造性地既正确处理了战争时期战斗与生产的关系，又正确处理了建设时期国防建设与经济建设的关系。新疆生产建设兵团，正是中国人民解放军集体转业的一部分。它是一支劳武结合的、具有高度组织性、纪律性，具有丰富的战斗经验和高度政治觉悟的队伍，是新疆地区国民经济建设战线上，特别是农垦建设战线上一支突击队；它是无产阶级国际主义的、全心全意为各族人民服务的、为社会主义和共产主义事业奋斗的队伍。
    1949年的秋末，新疆宣告和平解放，进驻新疆的人民解放军，响应党中央和毛主席的号召，以急风迅雷之势，掀起了兴修水利、开荒造田、发展农业、畜牧业和加工副业的生产高潮，仅1950年一年之间，新疆军区部队使用简陋的手工农具，就开出荒地六十余万亩，创造了辉煌的垦荒纪录。随之，全军指战员又以节衣缩食、节约军费的方法，建成了新疆地区第一批现代工业。所有这些奇迹式的、高速度发展着的生产建设事业，无疑是新疆地区社会主义建设最早的一次飞跃发展。解放了的新疆各族人民，在党的领导下，在人民解放军艰苦奋斗的影响与鼓舞下，也同时发起了空前的生产大进军。新疆的面貌，开始发生着历史性的巨大变化。
    为了既有利于加强国防部队的现代化训练，又有利于更好地发展生产，1952年，遵照军委指示，驻新疆人民解放军，除一部分编为国防部队外，其余转编为若干农业建设师和工程建设师。随后又于1954年，将这些建设师合并组成了新疆生产建设兵团。一支包括着工、农、兵、学、商和农、林、牧、副、渔的联合生产大军，就以一种崭新的形式诞生了。
    十年来的经验证明，在人烟稀少，土地辽阔，又是少数民族聚居的新疆，采用生产建设兵团这种形式（它一直保持着军队的师、团、营、连、排、班的组织形式），不但是多、快、好、省地进行建设的一种最好方式，并且是作为中央支援地方，汉族人民支援少数兄弟民族的一种最好方式。生产建设兵团自始就符合着“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，管理民主化”的精神和制度。它保持军队的组织形式，能更好地继承和发扬这种传统，这种传统的本质是：争取时间，克服困难和创造条件，这正是人民军队英勇、顽强、敏捷、主动、藐视困难并随时准备战胜困难的高贵品质和高尚的共产主义风格，也正是多、快、好、省地建设社会主义所必需的品质和风格。
    现在，已经是第十一年了，生产建设兵团在中央农垦部和新疆自治区党委的直接领导下，沿着党中央和毛主席指示的胜利道路阔步前进。到今年，全兵团的耕地面积约相当于1949年全新疆的88％左右；播种面积相当于1949年全新疆的62％；修建水利工程增加灌溉面积相当于1949年全新疆的150％；拥有牲畜相当于1949年全新疆的12.8％；全部工业总产值，相当于1949年全新疆的七十七倍，其他如建筑工程、交通运输、财贸以及文教卫生事业也均有相当巨大的发展。除了直接经营的这些经济事业之外，它总是把迎接自治区最艰苦的建设任务看做光荣的义不容辞的责任，就其大者而言，比如，在自治区连年来主要的工业基本建设中；在险峻的穿越天山的乌库公路、浩大的克拉玛依矿区，以及兰新铁路等工程的建设中，生产建设兵团的战士们都曾挺身而出，付出了自己的劳动。由此可以看出，这支逐渐为新式农业机械和先进技术武装起来的生产部队，正在日益成长为自治区建设战线上指东打东，指西打西，机动顽强的现代化生产建设兵团。
    今后，摆在生产建设兵团面前的中心任务，是在党的领导下，团结各族人民，搞好生产，搞好职工的政治文化学习和民兵训练。忠心耿耿地把自己置于自治区党委和各级地方党委领导之下，模范地拥护政府，真诚地热爱各族人民，和那些哪怕仅是萌芽的骄傲自满情绪，哪怕仅仅是残余的大汉族主义思想，进行坚决的斗争。十年来，这支部队在完成本身所担负的繁重的生产建设任务的同时，积极忘我劳动，参加了其它各项社会主义建设事业。各族人民异口同声称颂兵团说：“哪里最艰苦，生产建设兵团就战斗在哪里；人民群众哪里有困难，就可以在哪里看到生产建设兵团伸出来援助的双手。”虽然我们取得了一定的成绩，但是，我们丝毫也不以此为满足。一支用无产阶级国际主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的部队，应该以最大的同情和衷心的敬爱，寄予在历史上饱受摧残的兄弟民族；把增强民族团结和保卫民族团结当作第一重要任务；把迅速改变少数兄弟民族的社会、经济、文化的落后状况，当作自己的神圣职责。在现有的基础上，把为各族人民大办好事的运动，开展得比以往任何时候都更加广泛、深入和持久，做出更加显著的成绩，以进一步增强各民族之间兄弟般的情谊和牢不可破的团结。
    从十年来生产建设的经验和基础出发，完全可以设想，在今后两三年间，使我们国营农场的建设、生产与经营管理工作，上升到一个更高级的阶段和水平。到1962年，要求做到：
    一、农业方面：扩大一倍耕地面积。进一步全面、彻底、认真地贯彻“八字宪法”。三年以上的老场，其牧草面积必须占总播种面积的20％，每万亩必须有大小家畜（猪、羊、牛、马）二千头，家禽（鸡、鸭）一万只，做到牧场与农场合一，畜牧队与生产队合一，把农牧二者结合到最高限度。粮食单产应达到三百五十斤（新疆地区复播很少），棉花单产应达到皮棉一百斤。每万亩配备拖拉机五个标准台，从现在66％的机械化水平，提高到93％，从现在工人管理定额七十亩，提高到二百亩。
    二、水利方面：水利是新疆农业的命脉。必须把现在地面水灌溉利用率50％的状况，提高为75％。必须通过工程挖掘和排灌设备的利用，把大量的未被启用的地下水取出来，使之为扩大耕地面积服务。必须在今后所有水利工程上，充分实现灌溉、发电、航行综合利用。不仅场场有电，还要队队有电；不仅干渠内行船，而且支渠内也要行船；所有农场的运输，必须水陆并举、渠渠有船。
    三、园林方面：农场要园林化。开荒到哪里，种树到哪里。第一年育苗，二年移植，三年成行、成带，四年成荫，达到全场园林化。生产建设兵团将同各族人民共勉，为绿化祖国新疆而奋斗。
    四、建成国家农牧产品商品基地：在进一步提高劳动生产率和提高单位面积产量的基础上，以棉花、大豆、油料、猪肉、牛羊肉、羊毛、禽肉、禽蛋等八项计算，到1962年，将从现在的45％的综合商品率提高到60％。
    总之，必须贯彻以农业为基础的正确方针，以促成各种事业的共同跃进。
    新疆是一张多么宽广洁净的白纸！生产建设兵团将和各族人民一同挥起巨笔，写成雄伟的诗，画出绚丽的画，把占我国土地六分之一的新疆，建成一片锦绣河山。
    在发展生产的同时，我们将和全国人民一起，响应党的号召，大办民兵师，把生产单位和战斗单位结合起来，利用每个生产季节的间隙，进行政治、文化、生产技术知识和民兵训练。如果帝国主义侵略者胆敢侵犯我们神圣的社会主义祖国，就会发现这里是一个勇猛战斗的、全民皆兵的汪洋大海！就会发现我们任何人都没有沉睡在梦乡里而失去警觉和斗志。
    当此伟大的中国人民解放军建军三十三周年的时候，新疆生产建设兵团的转业战士们，向自己亲密的战友、英雄的中国人民解放军致敬！向党中央致敬！向伟大的领袖和胜利的舵手毛主席致敬！
