Persevere and Take Another Step Forward
Zhang Gensheng, Secretary-General of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China

Since the promotion of the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee's experience of going deep into the grassroots in the second half of May, more than 19,000 cadres from the provincial, prefectural, and county-level leading organs in Guangdong Province have gone to the front line of production, and more than 160,000 commune and brigade cadres have moved to production teams. Although the time has been short, great gains have been made in connecting with the masses and improving leadership style. In the past, when a task was assigned in some places, there was little specific and in-depth management, and as a result, many measures were not implemented thoroughly and were left hanging in the air. Now, after assigning a task, they immediately follow up to the brigade and team level and meet directly with the masses. If there are any problems in implementation, they can be supplemented and modified at any time, and any difficulties can be helped to be resolved, so that the task can be carried out consistently. In the past, some work was not done well, but they were very busy every day, with one meeting after another. Now the work is done well, and they are not so busy, and they even have time to study. The broad masses are even more jubilant and warmly welcome the change in the work style of the cadres. They have expressed eight satisfactions with the cadres going deep into the lower levels: first, they are satisfied that the cadres take the lead in participating in labor; second, they are satisfied with the operation of public canteens; third, they are satisfied with discussing matters with the masses; fourth, they are satisfied with strengthening the leadership of backward teams; fifth, they are satisfied with running the communes diligently and frugally; sixth, they are satisfied with the cadres' concern for the lives of the commune members; seventh, they are satisfied with the cadres making intimate friends with the commune members; and eighth, they are satisfied with the cadres' down-to-earth work. Now the relationship between cadres and the masses is closer, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses is even higher, thus greatly promoting the current production.

Going deep down and improving work style is an important measure to carry forward our Party's glorious tradition and promote socialist construction. However, some people who have gone deep into the grassroots have not understood its significance. Here, the Dapu County Party Committee's analysis of the ideological situation of the 2,609 cadres after they went deep into the grassroots is very illustrative. Among these cadres, there are three different attitudes. The first is to go deep down wholeheartedly, work hard diligently, closely connect with the masses, earnestly help the grassroots cadres solve problems, care for the lives of the masses, and express their intention to persevere for a long time. These cadres account for about 50% to 60%. The second is that their work performance is average, not very bad, but not very good. Some people started with great enthusiasm, but after one or two months, they became unfocused again. These people still have the mentality of temporary work teams and lack long-term plans. Some people have not yet found in-depth working methods and their work efficiency is not high. They account for about 30% to 40%. The third is to pretend to go down. Some people go down for three days and come up for two days, going down in the open and coming up in secret. Their working methods are still to hold meetings and walk around. A very few people even set up their own small stoves, living a special life. The masses say that they are "physically in the countryside, but their hearts are in the city." They are afraid of hardship and lack the strong will to build socialism. These people account for about 10%. We believe that this analysis is representative. It can be seen from this that it is not an easy task to make all cadres persevere in going deep into the grassroots.

According to existing experience, to make all cadres adhere to the style of hard work and going deep, the first thing is for leading cadres at all levels to set an example, both by taking the lead in going deep down and by taking the lead in persevering. In the previous period, it was because the secretaries of the local Party committees and county Party committees first went to the backward communes and backward teams to personally lead and solve problems, which played a huge role in promoting the work. Therefore, in a very short period of time, a high tide of going deep down and improving work style was quickly set off. The actual situation in various places fully reflects that wherever the leading cadres take the lead in going deep, the cadres at all levels will go down more and go down faster. Wherever the leaders have great determination and good persistence, most of the cadres will perform well and the work will change significantly. Therefore, the key lies first in the main leading comrades at all levels making up their minds to set an example, working hard diligently, and persevering.

Secondly, we must care for the cadres and help them continuously solve problems in working methods. The situation in various places has proved that the vast majority of our cadres are willing to go deep into the grassroots and hope to do a good job, but some people do not have experience in doing grassroots work, and some people are not familiar with agricultural production knowledge and the people's communes, so they will inevitably encounter many difficulties when they first go down. Even leading comrades of Party committees at all levels and cadres engaged in rural work will encounter some new contradictions after the working methods are changed, such as the combination of participating in labor and leading work, the combination of the center and departments, the combination of grasping key points and overall guidance, and the combination of grasping backwardness and grasping advancement. These all need to be helped to be resolved in a timely manner. Therefore, every leading comrade must be very concerned about the cadres, not only caring about their lives and learning, but also helping them solve the difficulties encountered in their work in a timely manner. In particular, through typical demonstrations, analyzing sparrows, and exchanging experiences, we can help them continuously improve their working methods. In this way, they can overcome difficulties, increase confidence, work with peace of mind, and persevere to the end.

Thirdly, it is necessary to conduct serious ideological struggle against the few cadres who pretend to go down, so that they themselves and the broad masses of cadres can be educated. Although the number of such people is small, the impact is very bad. The purpose of our criticism is to educate and help those who have made mistakes to improve their awareness and correct their mistakes. The actual situation in many places has proved that as long as we firmly grasp education and patiently help, most people can correct their mistakes after a period of time. Most of our cadres in organs at all levels, especially commune cadres, were originally promoted from rural work. Their essence is good. Even if they have some shortcomings now, they will consciously overcome them after education and strengthened supervision. For another part of the cadres who are intellectuals or have been working in organs for a long time and are not familiar with the rural situation, as long as they are patiently helped and trained for a period of time, they will also establish feelings with the countryside, and the vast majority of them can persevere and do a good job.

The construction situation of our country, which is advancing by leaps and bounds, is inspiring the people. The current unprecedented large-scale upsurge of going deep down and improving work style will surely persevere and produce a huge positive effect on our socialist construction cause. After persevering, another issue that should be resolved is that we must take another step forward. Changing from the leadership method of sitting in the office, relying on meetings, and issuing documents to going deep down to the front line of production and directly solving problems is undoubtedly a big step forward. However, with the in-depth development of actual work, our working methods must continue to improve. According to the problems that have been encountered in various places and the preliminary experience gained, to make our work style improve, we must pay attention to solving the following problems.

First, we must solve the problem of combining grasping key points and overall guidance. Now the work of leading organs at all levels is very heavy, with tasks one after another and work closely linked. Therefore, each period must have the unified arrangement of the Party committee to ensure that each gets its due place and develops comprehensively. For more than a month, most of the offices of the local Party committees, county Party committees, and commune Party committees in charge of the movement have moved to key brigades along with the first secretary, so that they can go deeper into one point and grasp the overall situation, and guide the overall situation by breaking through key points. At the same time, other secretaries and members have adopted the method of leading by dividing areas and taking responsibility for specific areas, which not only goes directly into one point, but also manages the overall leadership of one area. Some places have also adopted two sets of personnel, front and rear, with the front managing the point and the rear managing the surface, cooperating and supporting each other. Some places also adopted the method of spending two-thirds of their time squatting on the spot and one-third of their time checking on the surface. In addition, they added meeting of heads of group (regular and irregular), phone calls, and issuing notices to exchange experiences, and other forms, which better solved the combination of going deep into key points and strengthening overall guidance. The busy summer harvest and summer planting, summer grain procurement carried out in the rural areas of the province recently, as well as the tense struggle to overcome two strong typhoons and rainstorms in Shantou and Zhanjiang areas on June 8 and June 20, have proved that these methods are successful, and that points and surfaces can be closely combined.

Second, we must solve the problem of combining grasping the center and grasping departmental work. In the past, the idea that some departments served the central work was not clear, and departmental work could not effectively support industrial and agricultural production. Now, a large number of cadres have gone deep into the grassroots, and cadres doing departmental work have a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between central work and departmental work, and therefore have actively strengthened their support for central tasks such as industrial and agricultural production. How can departmental work serve the central work? Many places have created in this area and successfully resolved this contradiction. For example, the Party committee regularly conducts unified arrangements and deployments for overall work, and pays attention to regularly checking the service of departmental work to the central work, and also strengthens the leadership of departmental work. The Party organizations of various departments, according to the unified deployment of the Party committee, actively arrange their own work, actively participate in and cooperate with the central tasks, and regularly report the situation to the Party committee and raise questions, thus also striving for the Party committee's leadership of their own departments. Some departments spend two-thirds of their time participating in central work or going deep into key points, and one-third of their time handling departmental work or checking on the surface, or some people go deep into key points, participate in central work, and some people specialize in departmental work and checking on the surface. People who go to the countryside to participate in central movements can simultaneously create experience in conducting departmental work in their own locations on the premise of completing the central work, which can strengthen guidance on the surface. We believe that these are effective methods. As long as we seriously pay attention to research and application, it will surely enable our various construction undertakings to achieve a more comprehensive leap forward.

Third, we must solve the problem of combining grasping advancement and grasping backwardness. At any time and in any work, there will be an imbalance between advancement and backwardness. In the past one or two years, we have focused on grasping advanced creation experience, which has played a very important role in breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and making great strides forward. However, compared with this, we have not grasped the work in backward areas enough. Recently, the entire province, from top to bottom, has emphasized grasping backwardness greatly, with the secretaries taking the lead and personally living in backward teams to visit the poor, ask about their suffering, and understand the situation. Although the time has not been long, we have grasped the key to the problem, so the situation has undergone a preliminary change. Now, the problem that needs to be further solved is that we must continue to grasp the backwardness to the end to thoroughly transform it, and at the same time, we must grasp the advancement to obtain experience to guide the overall situation. Many places have adopted the method of using the main force to grasp the backward communes and teams, while also using a certain force to grasp the advanced communes and teams. The experience gained in this way is more complete and conducive to guiding the development of overall work. Of course, after a period of work, all or most of these backward communes and teams may catch up and become advanced communes and teams. At that time, the leadership's strength should also be adjusted accordingly. However, the development of work is unbalanced at any time, and advancement and backwardness are relatively and constantly changing. Therefore, we should always pay attention to both grasping advancement and especially strengthening help to backward areas. This will make the work develop from imbalance to balance, and then from new imbalance to new balance, so that the work can be continuously pushed forward.

Fourth, grasping production and grasping life should be carried out simultaneously. The basic task of the people's communes is to both organize various productions and manage the people's lives. The purpose of developing production is to improve the people's lives, and to improve the people's lives, we must first do a good job in production. The two are closely related and must be grasped with both hands. This is a long-term policy. Facts have proved that where the masses' lives are doing well, production is even better. Where the lives are not doing well, production is also affected. This is a basic experience. After the people's communeization, with the further collectivization of production, the people's lives have also been collectivized. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine that production can be done well by only grasping production and not grasping life. After repeated emphasis for more than a year, many places have paid close attention and done a very good job. However, there are still some people who do not pay attention to arranging the lives of the masses, and as a result, production has not been done well. Therefore, we must further emphasize that grasping production and grasping life should be carried out simultaneously, starting from production and starting from life, and promoting production by grasping life.

Fifth, properly solve the problem of combining the labor, work, and study of cadres. Recently, many places have promoted the "two-five system," "one-four system," "three-seven system" and other leadership methods. Many places have also adopted the method of half-day labor and half-day work, or daytime labor and morning and evening meetings, and try to work during labor and labor during work. This has better solved the problem of combining work and labor. Some places have also adopted the method of working separately at ordinary times and studying together regularly, or reading individually at ordinary times and discussing together regularly to organize cadres to study. In this way, production can be led through production, so that the work can be done well, and the phenomenon that they could not labor or study when they were busy in the past can be overcome.

The above-mentioned problems are still being explored and solved, and many experiences are not yet mature. However, as long as we can persevere, constantly summarize, and constantly improve, we will surely be able to push our work style and working methods to a new stage.

    坚持下去　提高一步
    中共广东省委秘书长　张根生
    自从5月下半月推广汕头地委深入基层的经验以来，广东全省省、地、县三级领导机关有一万九千多个干部下到了生产第一线，有十六万多个公社和大队干部搬到了生产小队。时间虽然不长，但在联系群众改进领导作风方面已经得到了巨大收获。过去有些地方一个工作布置下去，很少再具体深入地管，结果很多措施贯不到底，悬在半空中。现在布置之后，马上跟到大队、小队去，直接和群众见面。执行中有什么问题，可以随时补充修改，有什么困难可以帮助解决，能够一贯到底。过去有些工作做不好，但天天忙得很，一个会接一个会，现在工作做好了，也没有那样忙，还有时间学习了。广大群众更是兴高采烈，热诚欢迎干部作风的转变。他们对干部深入下层，提出八大满意：一满意干部带头参加劳动，二满意办好公共食堂，三满意有事和群众商量，四满意加强落后队领导，五满意勤俭办社，六满意干部关心社员生活，七满意干部与社员交知心朋友，八满意干部工作踏实。现在干部和群众的关系更密切了，广大群众的劳动积极性更高涨了，因此也就大大的推动了当前生产。
    深入下去，改进作风，这是发扬我党光荣传统，促进社会主义建设的一项重要措施。但是，有些深入基层的人并没有了解它的意义。这里，大埔县县委对于二千六百零九个干部深入基层以后思想状况的分析，很能说明问题。在这批干部中，持有三种不同的态度，第一种是全心全意深入下去，埋头苦干，密切联系群众，认真帮助基层干部解决问题，关心群众生活，而且表示要长久坚持下去的，这种干部大约占50％到60％。第二种是工作表现一般，不算很坏，也不很好，有些人开始劲头很大，但是过上一、二个月就又飘浮起来，这些人仍是临时工作队的思想，缺乏长期打算。也有些人还没有找到深入的工作方法，工作效率不高。大约占30％至40％。第三种是假下去，有的人是三天下去，两天上来，明里下去，暗里上来。他们的工作方法仍然是除了开会，就走来走去。有极少数人甚至自立小灶，生活特殊，群众说他们是“身在农村，心在城市”。他们害怕艰苦，缺乏建设社会主义坚强意志。这种人大约占10％左右。我们认为这个分析是有代表性的。由此可见，要使全体干部坚持不懈地深入基层，并不是一件容易的事情。
    根据现有经验来看，要使全体干部坚持艰苦深入的作风，首先是要各级领导干部，以身作则，既带头深入下去，也带头坚持下去。前一段就是由于各地委书记、县委书记，首先以身作则下到了落后社落后队去亲自领导，解决问题，起了巨大的推动作用。因而在很短时期内，就迅速掀起了一个深入下去，改进作风的高潮。现在各地实际情况充分反映出来，凡是领导干部带头深入的地方，各级干部也就下去的多，下去得快，凡是领导决心大、坚持好的地方，大多数干部也就表现得好，工作面貌起了显著变化。因此，关键首先在于各级主要领导同志要下定决心做出榜样，埋头苦干，坚持下去。
    其次，必须关心干部，帮助他们不断解决工作方法问题。各地情况证明了，我们干部队伍中绝大多数人都是愿意深入基层，希望搞好工作的，但是有些人没有做基层工作的经验，有些人对农业生产知识和人民公社不熟悉，因此刚下去时必然会遇到很多困难。就是各级党委的领导同志和从事农村工作的干部，在工作方法改变之后也会碰到一些新的矛盾，例如参加劳动和领导工作结合，中心和部门结合，抓重点和全面指导的结合，抓落后和抓先进的结合等等。这些都需要及时帮助他们解决。因此每个领导同志要十分关心干部，既要关心他们的生活和学习，更要及时帮助他们解决工作中遇到的困难。特别是通过典型示范，解剖麻雀，交流经验等办法帮助他们不断改进工作方法。这样就可以使他们自己能够克服困难，提高信心，安心工作，坚持到底。
    再次，就是对于少数假下去的干部，必须进行严肃的思想斗争，以便使他们本人和广大干部受到教育。这种人人数虽少，但影响很坏。我们批评的目的，是为了教育和帮助犯有错误的人提高觉悟，改正错误。许多地方的实际情况证明，只要我们抓紧教育和耐心帮助，经过一个时期之后，绝大多数人都是可以改正过来的。我们各级机关干部，特别是公社干部大部分都是原来农村工作中提拔出来的，他们的本质是好的，现在即使有一些缺点，只要经过教育和加强监督以后，就会自觉克服的。对于另一部分知识分子出身或长期在机关工作而对农村情况不大熟悉的干部，只要耐心帮助和经过一个时期的锻炼之后，他们也就会和农村建立起感情，绝大多数人也都是可以坚持下去做好工作的。
    我们国家一日千里的建设形势，鼓舞着人们，现在出现的这个空前未有的大规模的深入下去改进作风的热潮，一定可以坚持下去，对我们的社会主义建设事业产生巨大的积极作用。坚持下去以后，要提出另一个应该解决的问题，就是必须提高一步。从坐办公室，靠开会发文件的领导方法，改变为深入下去到生产第一线，直接解决问题，无疑的这是前进了一大步。但是，随着实际工作的深入发展，我们的工作方法必须继续提高。根据当前各地已经遇到的问题和初步取得的经验来看，要使我们在改进作风方面提高一步，必须注意解决好以下几个问题。
    一、必须解决好抓住重点和全面指导相结合的问题。现在各级领导机关的工作都非常繁重，任务一个接着一个，工作一环扣着一环，各项工作都是密切相联的。因此，各个时期都必须有党委的统一安排，才能各得其所，全面发展。一个多月来，大多数地委、县委和公社党委掌握运动的办公室，都随着第一书记搬到了重点大队，这样就能既深入一点，又掌握全面，通过突破重点来指导全面；同时其他书记、委员都采取分片领导包干负责的方法，既直接深入一点又分管一个地区的全面领导；有的地方还采取了前后方两套人马，前方管点，后方管面，互相配合，互相支援的方法；有些地方还采取了三分之二的时间蹲点，三分之一的时间到面上检查；再加上碰头会（定期和不定期的）打电话，出通报交流经验等等形式，就比较好的解决了既深入重点又加强全面指导的结合问题。最近在全省农村中进行的繁忙的夏收夏种、夏征夏购工作，以及6月8日和6月20日在汕头和湛江地区战胜两次强台风暴雨的紧张斗争，都证明了这些方法是成功的，点和面也是完全可以密切结合的。
    二、必须解决好抓中心和抓部门工作相结合的问题。以前，有些部门为中心工作服务的思想不明确，部门工作不能有力的支援工、农业生产。现在，大批干部深入基层，做部门工作的干部对于中心工作和部门工作的关系，有了比较全面的了解，因此主动的加强了对工、农业生产等中心任务的支援。怎样使部门工作为中心工作服务呢？这方面很多地方都有创造，成功地解决了这个矛盾。例如党委定期对全面工作进行统一的安排部署，并注意经常检查部门工作为中心工作服务的情况，同时也就加强了对部门工作的领导。各部门的党组织根据党委的统一布置，主动安排自己的工作，积极参加和配合中心任务，并且经常向党委汇报情况提出问题，这样也就争取了党委对自己部门的领导。有的部门以三分之二的时间参加中心工作或深入重点，以三分之一的时间处理部门工作或到面上检查，或者一部分深入重点，参加中心工作，一部分人专管部门工作，面上检查。下乡参加中心运动的人，在完成中心工作的前提下，同时可以在自己所在地创造进行部门工作的经验，这样又可加强对面上的指导。我们认为这些都是行之有效的方法。只要认真注意研究运用，必将使我们的各项建设事业得到更全面的跃进。
    三、必须解决好抓先进和抓落后相结合的问题。任何时候任何工作都会有先进和落后的不平衡现象的。这一、二年来我们着重抓了先进创造经验，对于破除迷信、解放思想，大踏步前进起了非常重要的作用。但是，相比之下对于落后地区的工作就有些抓得不够。最近以来，全省从上到下都强调了大抓落后，书记挂帅，亲自住到落后队去，访贫问苦，了解情况。时间虽然不长，但已抓住了问题的关键所在，因此局面有了初步改变。现在须要进一步解决的问题是，既要把落后继续抓到底使之彻底改造，同时又要抓先进，以取得经验指导全面。很多地方采取了除以主要力量抓落后的社队之外，同时也以一定的力量抓先进的社队。这样取得的经验就更加完整，而有利于指导全面工作的开展。当然这一批落后的社、队，经过一个时期工作之后，可能全部或大部分都会赶上来，而变为先进的社、队，那时领导的力量也应该随着适当的调整。但是工作的发展在任何时候都是有不平衡的，先进和落后也是相对的不断变化的。因之，我们在任何时候都应该注意既抓先进，又特别加强对落后地区的帮助。使工作由不平衡发展到平衡，再由新的不平衡发展到新的平衡，这样往复循环，就把工作向前不断推进了。
    四、抓生产和抓生活同时并举。人民公社的基本任务就是既要组织好各种生产，又要管理好人民生活。发展生产的目的就是为了改善人民的生活，而要改善人民生活又必须首先搞好生产，两者密切相联，必须两手抓，这是长期的方针。事实证明，凡是群众生活搞得好的地方，生产也就更好，凡是生活搞得不好的地方，也就影响了生产，这是一条基本经验。人民公社化以后，随着生产进一步集体化，人民的生活也实现了集体化，因此不可能设想只抓生产不抓生活而能搞好生产。经过一年多来的反复强调，许多地方已经十分注意，并做得很好了。但是也仍有一些人不注意安排好群众生活，结果使生产也没有搞好。因此还必须进一步强调抓生产和抓生活同时并举，从生产出发，从生活着手，通过抓生活来促进生产。
    五、妥善解决干部的劳动、工作和学习的结合问题。最近很多地方都推行了“二五制”、“一四制”、“三七制”等领导方法，也有很多地方采取了半天劳动、半天工作，或者白天劳动，早晚开会，尽量做到劳动中有工作，工作中也有劳动，这就比较好的解决了工作和劳动结合的问题。也有些地方还采用了平时分散工作，定期集中学习或者平时个人阅读，定期集中讨论等方法，组织干部学习，这样，可通过生产来领导生产，使工作做得好，又克服了过去忙忙碌碌不能劳动也不能学习的现象。
    上述这些问题，目前还正在摸索解决，许多经验还不成熟，但是只要我们能够坚持下去，不断总结，不断提高，就一定可以把我们的工作作风和工作方法，推向一个新的阶段。
