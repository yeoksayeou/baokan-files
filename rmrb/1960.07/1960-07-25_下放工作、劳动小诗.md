Poems on Working and Laboring Down Below

	Yang Ping
A wisp of willow smoke, a small bridge to the east,
A thatched cottage and simple bed, I'm a student once more.
At noon, wind and rain, transplanting seedlings urgently,
Returning home at night, we chat of mulberry and farming.
Calloused hands and feet know hardship,
Each grain of rice, a cup of sweat.
Only with roots in the soil can there be writing,
And the poetry of workers and peasants is especially rich.
At dusk, I join the commune members in mountain songs,
A sky full of clouds like brocade in the red sunset.

    下放工作、劳动小诗
    杨平一抹烟柳小桥东，茅舍陈榻作学童。傍午风雨插秧急，灯下归来话桑农。胼手胝足知辛苦，一粒稻米汗一盅。泥土文章方有根，工农诗情分外浓。暮与社员联山歌，满天云锦夕阳红。
