    To Backward Teams to Help Formulate Plans, Organize Production and Learning
    Qingpu County Party Committee Grasps Low-Yield Fields to Catch Up with High-Yield Fields
    (By our newspaper) The Qingpu County Party Committee of Shanghai Municipality, in leading the current production campaign, has tightly grasped the central link of low-yield fields catching up with high-yield fields, effectively promoting summer production. Currently, the rice seedlings in the county's more than 100,000 mu of low-yield fields are growing lush and green.
    Qingpu County is one of Shanghai's well-known rice-producing areas. Low-yield fields account for more than 20% of the total area. The County Party Committee and the Party Committees of various communes regard the backward teams and poor teams in low-yield areas as the front line of the production front line. The County Party Committee has sent a large number of cadres to these low-yield teams to strengthen leadership. The County Party Committee selected 157 mu of low-yield fields in the Cangyuan Production Team of the Chengxiang Commune as a command field for catching up with high-yield fields. Three secretaries of the County Party Committee participated in the command field's labor of accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, and leveling the land together with the commune members, and held three on-site meetings here to use their experience to guide the production of low-yield fields throughout the county.
    The resident cadres who assist in the work of backward and poor teams help the grassroots cadres of these teams formulate short-term operation plans, labor quotas, and organize production competitions; summarize experiences and lessons learned in their work; study the instructions of the higher-level Party, and improve their leadership level, so that all production is planned and step-by-step, and all measures to increase production are implemented. Xu Daosheng, deputy director of the Xicen Commune, after "settling" in the Youbin Production Team, helped this team cultivate 54 activists from poor and lower-middle peasants to become shock workers in production; and tutored the team cadres to learn the "two-five system" leadership method of Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, making the team cadres' work more in-depth and down-to-earth. This team originally lagged behind other teams in various tasks, but now the summer harvest and summer planting and living welfare work such as canteens and nurseries have caught up with the advanced teams.
    Cadres at all levels also pay special attention to providing poor teams with support in manpower, fertilizer, irrigation and drainage tools, and mobilize the masses to rely on their own efforts to accumulate more natural fertilizer and comprehensively develop sideline production such as poultry and livestock. This not only provides sufficient high-quality fertilizer for low-yield fields to catch up with high-yield fields, but also reduces production costs and increases income. The Liantang Commune has 110 low-lying dikes with an area of 9,700 mu. Before the start of summer planting this year, Han Shitai, secretary of the Commune Party Committee, helped these teams organize professional teams to carry out a concentrated effort to build more than 300 drainage trenches and build a new water-blocking dam. Eighteen water-lifting machines and 228 windmills were transferred from other areas, greatly improving the drainage, irrigation, and flood control capabilities. After the end of summer planting, these teams were helped to comprehensively arrange labor and carry out fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaigns, increasing the material conditions for these teams with lower income levels to allow low-yield fields to catch up with high-yield fields, and for poor teams to become rich teams.

    到后进队去帮助订计划组织生产和学习
    青浦县委抓低产田赶高产田
    本报讯　中共上海市青浦县县委在领导当前生产运动中，抓紧低产田赶高产田这一中心环节，有力的推动了夏季生产。现在，全县十多万亩低产田，稻苗已长得一片葱绿。
    青浦县是上海市郊著名的水稻产区之一。全县低产田占总面积20％以上。县委和各公社党委把低产地区的后进队、穷队作为生产第一线的第一线，县委向这些低产队派去大批干部，加强领导。县委在城厢公社仓园生产队选择了一百五十七亩低产田作为赶高产田的指挥田，县委有三位书记和社员一起参加指挥田的积肥、运肥、整地等劳动，并在这里先后召开了三次现场会议，用他们的经验来指导全县低产田的生产。
    在后进队、穷队协助工作的驻队干部，帮助这些队的基层干部制订小段作业计划、劳动定额和组织生产竞赛；总结工作中的经验和教训；学习上级党的各项指示，提高他们的领导水平，从而使各项生产做到有计划有步骤，项项增产措施落实。西岑公社副主任徐道生在尤滨生产队“落户”后，帮助这个队培养了五十四个贫、下中农的积极分子成为生产中的突击手；并辅导队干部学习了河北省吴桥县的“二五制”领导方法，使生产队的干部，工作更加深入、踏实。这个队原来各项工作都落在其他队后面，现在夏收夏种等生产和食堂、托儿所等生活福利工作都已赶上了先进队。
    各级干部还特别注意给穷队以人力、肥料、排灌工具等支援，并发动群众自力更生多积自然肥料，全面发展家禽家畜等副业生产，这不仅为低产田赶高产田提供了足够的优质肥料，还能够降低生产成本、增加收入。练塘公社有面积达九千七百亩的一百十个低荡圩。今年夏种开始前，公社党委书记翰世泰等就帮助这些队组织专业队伍，突击兴修了三百多条排水垅沟，新筑了一条堵水大坝，并从其他地区调往十八部戽水机和二百二十八部风车，使排灌、防涝能力大大提高。在夏种结束后，又帮助这些队全面安排劳力，开展积肥、造肥运动，为这些收入水平较低的队增加了低产田赶高产田、增加了由穷队变富队的物质条件。（附图片）
