　　Exposing the "People's Capitalism" Farce
　　——Introducing "Critique of People's Capitalism"
　　〔US〕Eugene B. Cypher, translated by Ma Qinghuai, published by The Commercial Press, Gao Song
    In 1958, American progressive politician J.M. Budish published a book entitled "People's Capitalism, Stock Ownership and Production." The Chinese translation of this book has been published by The Commercial Press under the new title "Critique of People's Capitalism." "People's Capitalism" is a "theory" that has been heavily promoted in the United States, West Germany, Britain, and other capitalist countries since World War II, especially in recent years. The proponents of this "theory" insist that modern capitalism has shed or is shedding the drawbacks of "old capitalism" and is moving towards "new, reformed People's Capitalism." The "theory" of "People's Capitalism" has two basic arguments: one argument is that capitalists sell stocks to the vast number of workers, and workers and capitalists become "co-owners" of the company's property, thus realizing the "capital democratization" of "everyone is a capitalist"; the other argument is that the rapid expansion of production and the rapid economic development have realized the "universal prosperity" of capitalism. Based on many facts of the American reality, the author, Budish, made a profound critique of the fallacies of the apologists of capitalism.
    The author first points out that no matter how beautifully the propagandists of "People's Capitalism" describe modern capitalism, they have to admit in the face of facts that the "old" capitalism "mainly represents crisis, instability, unemployment, war, and imperialism," and that "wealth is highly concentrated, and workers are overworked and underpaid." Their articles can only do this, insisting that "American capitalism has undergone a process of transformation, so it is now almost completely different from classical capitalism... When Europeans talk about capitalism, what they are talking about no longer exists in the United States." After quoting some arguments of capitalist apologists, the author points out: "May I ask, when and how did this predatory capitalism become the so-called beneficial capitalism of today? What structural changes have taken place that have transformed the old system, which is generally recognized as neglecting public welfare, into the so-called new 'People's Capitalism'?" Yes, modern capitalism has indeed undergone great changes compared to "old" capitalism. This change can be summarized as: the free competition peculiar to "old" capitalism has been replaced by the monopoly of capitalist alliances, and monopoly organizations with huge economic and financial power have further strengthened the exploitation of the working people. This kind of change is by no means the transformation of capitalism into "People's Capitalism" as the capitalist apologists say.
    The propaganda machine of monopoly organizations certainly does not dare to face this real transformation squarely. In order to cover up this real situation, the American bourgeoisie once organized a special exhibition. Through the exposure of this exhibition, the author tells us that the structural changes that have taken place in the so-called transformation to "People's Capitalism" are one: the capital of company enterprises is divided into many shares, and the other is the stock exchange that undertakes various securities trading.
    Now let us take a look at how many people in the United States actually own shares in company enterprises? What have they, as "co-owners" of company enterprises, actually enjoyed? In order to powerfully expose the lies of monopoly organizations and their apologists, the author quoted a large amount of the confessions and figures of these apologists themselves. The author points out that although these situations and figures will not be completely true, they "will not help to prove their argument." The sad thing about capitalist apologists' painstaking efforts lies here. A survey conducted by the New York Stock Exchange in the spring of 1956 showed that a total of 8,630,000 individuals owned stocks, accounting for about 5% of the total population of the United States. And the Federal Reserve's survey said that the number of shareholders was 5.5 million. Regardless of how much the figures from the two surveys differ, it can be seen that the number of people who own stocks in the United States is extremely limited. Another set of statistics can better illustrate the actual situation of stock ownership. The market value of Rockefeller's stock in just one company, New Jersey Standard Oil, is more than twice the market value of all the stocks held by all wage earners in the United States. The Rockefeller Group is like this, and so are DuPont, Mellon, and other monopoly groups. From this, it can also be seen that even if wage earners hold some stocks, their ownership is negligible. These minority shareholders certainly have no say in the control of the economy. The so-called sales of stocks to make the vast number of workers "co-owners" of enterprise property is a complete lie.
    In order to further expose the monopoly groups' scam about "People's Capitalism," the author also cited a "story." In July 1956, the New York Stock Exchange announced that it had found a "typical" stock holder. It is said that this person has an annual income of $7,500, initially had only one share of American Gas and Electric Company, and later relied on this share to become the owner of 23 shares. As soon as this news was announced, it was exposed. It turns out that this "typical" stock holder simply does not exist in the reality of American society.
    The author points out that this "story" not only shows what kind of dead end the propaganda of "People's Capitalism" has reached, but also reveals many other situations. Even according to official statistics, at least four-fifths of the residents in the United States have much less income than this stock holder. Calculated according to the closing price on April 12, 1957, the stocks held by this person were worth a total of $839.50; and according to the company's assets and the number of common stocks at the end of 1956, even to control 1% of the company's common stocks, there would have to be 9,000 such stock holders. As for the interest on dividends, according to the situation in 1956, this stock holder could only receive a total of $31.97, which is less than 4% of the market price of his stocks. In addition, in terms of benefiting from the rise in stock prices, what often happens is that they fluctuate constantly. On April 12, 1957, the company's stock fell $0.75 per share compared to December 31, 1956.
    The monopoly groups also know that relying solely on scams will not hook many people, so they also take coercive measures. Esso Standard Oil "promotes the method of workers participating in share capital as a means to ensure their loyalty"; some companies take the method of forcing workers to accept savings, deducting wages on time within the specified period, and issuing stocks when the savings period expires; and some enterprises desperately extend the savings period, stipulating that stocks will only be issued after workers have completely lost their labor or retired, and even stipulating that their heirs will only be allowed to receive stocks after the workers die.
    The monopoly groups are so enthusiastic about peddling stocks to workers, and their intentions are very obvious. That is, through the scam of so-called "everyone is a capitalist" to cover up the truth that monopoly capital controls the economy, to obtain the "goodwill" support of "small shareholders" for increasing profit rates and raising prices, and to paralyze the working class's awareness of struggle and weaken the solidarity of the working people. In addition, especially the monopoly groups can also plunder huge amounts of supplementary funds from these "small shareholders" every year by peddling stocks. It is true that "small shareholders" can also get a little dividend from it, and can also taste a little "sweetness" when stock prices rise. In fact, this little "income" is simply not as high as the interest on general savings, not to mention that this negligible benefit is far "more than offset by the loss of income and increased living expenses due to the weakening of the bargaining power of trade unions and the reduction of resistance to price and telecommunications cost increases, not to mention the fluctuations in stock market prices and the danger of sharp declines in stock market values during periods of industrial and commercial depression."
    Through the analysis of the American reality, the author, Budish, thoroughly exposes the lies of capitalist apologists, pointing out that: "This commodity with the 'People's Capitalism' trademark is actually just monopoly capitalism." No matter how eloquent their apologists are, they cannot change the fact that "the ownership and control of the entire American capitalist economy is concentrated in the hands of a small number of powerful capitalists."
    Budish's critique of the other argument of "People's Capitalism," "universal prosperity," is equally powerful.
    Capitalist apologists also adopt the method of first suppressing and then promoting when advocating "universal prosperity." They admit that capitalism has had crises and depressions, and that there have been stagnation and decline, but it is said that these "indecent" processes have become a thing of the past, and now it is embarking on "prosperity," and it is "universal prosperity." In order to refute this fallacy, the author compared "the economic development speed of the current advanced stage of American capitalism, which is labeled 'People's Capitalism'," with "the speed of the earlier period, which is recognized as ordinary capitalism." Compared with the earlier period of 1867-1907, the average annual growth rate of industrial production in the United States from 1928-1955 has decreased by almost one-third. Through a series of numerical comparisons, the author tells people: "This slow development of the American economy is not a matter of one day or two, nor is it caused by any special adversity. This is the inevitable result of the inherent characteristics of capitalism in the process of continuous concentration and monopolization."
    When expounding the above point of view, the author analyzed from "the characteristics of capitalism," "the imbalance and maladjustment in production development," and "the monopolization of the American economy" that: due to the contradiction between the socialization of production and capitalist private ownership, capitalist production "is bound to produce fluctuations of expansion and contraction at times, booms and depressions, and cause an increasing disconnection between production capacity and consumers' effective demand. As a result, the speed of economic development is bound to be slow."
    The author not only historically compared the economic development of the United States, but also compared the economic development speed of the United States with the economic development speed of Soviet socialism in the last chapter. The author first exposed a lie spread by the American government and economic organs, saying that the Soviet socialist system eliminated private enterprises for the purpose of pursuing profits, which fundamentally violated "human nature," and therefore could not greatly increase production. In fact, a slightly serious researcher will see that the Soviet economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, and its development speed is incomparable to that of the United States. Even the most licentious slanderer a few years ago now has to admit: "The painful truth is that the communist economic system is working well, so we cannot rest easy." By the way, this group of slanderers who fabricated the myth of "the incompetence of socialist economic production" are still spreading this set of self-deception about our China's Great Leap Forward today. But it is certain that before long, they will admit another "painful truth."
    After making the factual comparison, the author raised a question to the readers: Why is there such a significant slowdown and lag in the economic development of the United States, while the economy of the Soviet Union has developed so rapidly? This is indeed a question that the people of the United States and all capitalist countries are deeply concerned about. The author's answer to this question is very clear, he said: The key to the problem lies in the social system that embodies social relations. In the section "Comparison of the Two Systems," the author's hundreds of words of explanation on this issue can be said to be a summary of the book.
    "Critique of People's Capitalism" is a fascinating book. It has strict scientificity and strong combativeness. At the same time, the vividness and popularity of the text also enhance the book's attractiveness and persuasiveness to readers.

　　戳穿“人民资本主义”的西洋镜
　　——介绍“人民资本主义批判”
　　〔美〕布迪希著　马清槐译　商务印书馆出版　高崧
    美国进步政治家J·M·布迪希在1958年发表了《人民资本主义，股份占有和生产》一书。这本书的中译本已由商务印书馆出版，改名为《人民资本主义批判》。“人民资本主义”是第二次世界大战以后、特别是最近几年来在美国、西德、英国和其他一些资本主义国家被大吹大擂的一种“理论”。这个“理论”的宣传者们硬说：现代资本主义已经摆脱了或正在摆脱“旧资本主义”的弊端，走向“新的、经过改造的人民资本主义”。“人民资本主义”的“理论”有两条基本论据：一条论据是，资本家将股票卖给广大职工，职工和资本家都成为公司财产的“共有人”，这就实现了“人人都是资本家”的“资本民主化”；再一条论据是，生产的迅速扩大，经济的飞快发展，这就实现了资本主义的“普遍繁荣”。作者布迪希根据美国现实情况的许多事实，对资本主义辩护士的谬论作了深刻的批判。
    作者首先指出：不管“人民资本主义”的宣传家们把现代资本主义说得如何天花乱坠，但是，他们在事实面前不得不承认“旧”的资本主义“主要代表着危机、不稳定、失业、战争和帝国主义”，不得不承认“财富大量集中，工人工作过度而待遇菲薄”。他们的文章只能这样做，硬说：“美国的资本主义曾经经历了改造的过程，因此它现在几乎完全不同于古典的资本主义……当欧洲人谈到资本主义的时候，他们所谈的东西在美国已经不再存在了。”作者在引述了某些资本主义辩护士的议论之后指出：“不妨请问一下，这个掠夺成性的资本主义是在什么时候以怎样的方式变成今天所谓有益的资本主义的呢？曾经发生什么样的结构上的改变，居然把公认为忽视公共福利的旧制度变成所谓新的‘人民资本主义’的呢？”是的，现代资本主义同“旧”资本主义相比确有很大的变化，这个变化概括地来说就是：“旧”资本主义特有的自由竞争已为资本家联盟的垄断所代替，握有巨大经济和财政实力的垄断组织更加加强了对劳动人民的剥削。这种变化绝不像资本主义辩护士所说的资本主义变成了“人民资本主义”。
    垄断组织的宣传机器当然不敢正视这一真实的转变。为了掩盖这一真实的转变情况，美国资产阶级曾经组织过一个专门的展览会。通过对这个展览会的揭露，作者告诉我们：原来所谓转变到“人民资本主义”所发生的结构上的改变，一个是公司企业的资本分成了许多股，再一个是担当着各种证券买卖的证券交易所。
    现在就让我们来看看，美国人民究竟有多少拥有公司企业的股票？他们作为公司企业的“共有人”究竟享有了什么？为了有力地揭露垄断组织及其辩护士的谎言，作者大量地引用了这些辩护士自己招供的情况和数字。作者指出，尽管这些情况和数字不会是完全真实的，但是它们“也不会有助于证明他们的论点”。资本主义辩护士心劳日拙的可悲就在这里。纽约证券交易所在1956年春进行的一次调查表明，个人占有股票的共计有八百六十三万人，约占美国总人口的5％。而联邦储备局的调查说，股份占有者的人数是五百五十万。姑不论两者调查的数字有多大出入，由此已可看出，在美国占有股票的人数是极有限的。另有一份统计资料，更能说明股份占有的实际情况。洛克菲勒仅在新泽西美孚油公司一个公司的股票的市场价值，就比美国所有工资收入者手中全部股票的市场价值多一倍。洛克菲勒集团是如此，杜邦、梅隆和其他垄断集团无不如此。由此还可看出，工资收入者即使持有一些股票，其占有权也是微不足道的。这些少数股票的持有者，在对经济的控制方面当然是没有任何发言权的。所谓通过销售股票已使广大职工成为企业财产的“共有人”，是彻头彻尾的谎言。
    为了进一步揭露垄断集团关于“人民资本主义”的骗局，作者还引述了一段“故事”。纽约证券交易所在1956年7月里，宣布找到了一个“典型的”股票持有人。据说，这个人每年有七千五百美元的收入，最初只有美国煤气和电力公司的一张股票，后来依靠这张股票变成了二十三股的拥有者。这个消息刚刚宣布，就被人戳穿了。原来这个“典型的”股票持有人，在美国社会的现实里是根本就不存在的。
    作者指出，这段“故事”不仅表明了“人民资本主义”的宣传已经到了怎样的穷途末路，而且还透露了很多别的情况。即使根据官方的统计材料，在美国也至少有五分之四居民的收入，都比这个股票持有人少得多。按照1957年4月12日的收盘市价计算，这个人占有的股票共值八百三十九元五角；而根据1956年年底这个公司的资产和普通股票的数量，即使要控制这个公司的1％普通股票，也要有九千个这样的股票持有人。至于股息的利益，根据1956年的情况，这个股票持有人总共只能获得三十一元九角七分，即不到他的股票市场价格的4％。此外，从股票的涨价得到好处这一点来说，往往发生的情况是涨落无常。1957年4月12日这个公司的股票，每股即比1956年12月31日跌落了七角五分。
    垄断集团也自知仅仅依靠骗局是没有多少人上钩的，因此，他们还采取了强制手段。艾索美孚油公司把“推行工人参加股份资本的办法，作为保证他们忠诚的手段”；有些公司则采取强迫职工接受储蓄的办法，在指定的时期内按时扣除工资，储蓄期满时发给股票；还有些企业把储蓄期拼命延长，规定要到职工完全丧失劳动力或退职以后才发给股票，甚至规定要到职工死后才让他的继承人领取股票。
    垄断集团如此热中于向职工兜售股票，用心是很明显的。即：通过所谓“人人都是资本家”的骗局来掩盖垄断资本控制经济的真情实况，取得“小股东”们对提高利润率和提高物价的“善意”支持，以及借此麻痹工人阶级的斗争意识，削弱劳动人民的团结力量。此外，特别是垄断集团还通过兜售股票，每年可以从这些“小股东”手中掠夺去巨额的补充资金。诚然，“小股东”也可以从中取到一点股息，而且在股票上涨时还可以尝到一点“甜头”。其实，这一点“收益”根本就比不上一般储蓄的利息高，何况这种微不足道的利益，远“抵不过由于工会谈判力量的削弱以及对物价和电讯费用上涨的抵抗力的减低而产生的收入方面的损失和增加了的生活费用，更不必说股票市价的波动以及在工商业萧条时期股票市场价值锐落所带来的危险了。”
    作者布迪希通过对美国现实情况的分析，彻底地揭穿了资本主义辩护士的谎言，指出：“贴出‘人民资本主义’商标的这件商品，实际上不过是垄断资本主义”。不管他们的辩护士如何善说会道，也改变不了“整个美国资本主义经济的占有和控制，集中在人数不多但势力显赫的资本家手中”这一事实。
    布迪希对于“人民资本主义”的另一论据“普遍繁荣”的批判，是同样地有力的。
    资本主义辩护士在鼓吹“普遍繁荣”这一点上，也是采取的先抑后扬的手法。他们承认资本主义有过危机、萧条，有过停滞、下降，但是据说这些“不体面”的过程已经成为过去，现在是走上“繁荣”，而且是
  “普遍繁荣”了。作者为了驳斥这一谬论，把“标榜着‘人民资本主义’的美国资本主义的现今高级阶段的经济发展速度”，同“公认其为普通种类的资本主义的较早时期的速度”作了对比。以美国1928—1955年工业生产的每年平均增长率同较早时期1867—1907年相比，几乎下降了三分之一。作者通过一系列的数字对比，告诉人们：“美国经济的这种缓慢发展，不是一朝一夕的事，它也不是任何特殊的逆境造成的。这是资本主义在不断集中和垄断化的过程中由其固有的特征所造成的必然结果。”
    作者在论证上述论点时，从“资本主义的特征”、“生产发展中的不平衡和失调现象”和“美国经济的垄断化”等方面剖析了：由于生产的社会化和资本主义私人占有的矛盾，资本主义的生产“必然要产生一时扩展和一时收缩的波动、高涨和低落，并造成生产能力与消费者的有效需求之间的越来越脱节的现象。结果，经济发展的速度就必然缓慢。”
    作者不仅从历史上对比了美国经济发展的情况，而且在最后一章还把美国的经济发展速度同苏联社会主义的经济发展速度作了对比。作者首先戳穿了美国政府和经济机关所散布的一个谎言，他们说：苏联的社会主义制度消灭了以追求利润为目的的私人企业，就根本违反了“人性”，因而不可能大大地增加生产。其实，稍为严肃一点的研究者都会看到，苏联的经济是在突飞猛进，其发展速度是美国根本不能比拟的。连早几年最放肆的一个诽谤者现在也不得不承认：“沉痛的真实情况是，共产主义的经济制度发挥了良好的作用，使我们不能安之若素”。附带谈谈，这批制造“社会主义经济生产无能”的神话的诽谤家，今天对我们中国的大跃进，还在散布这一套自欺欺人之谈。但是可以肯定，不要多久，他们就会承认又一个“沉痛的真实情况”。
    作者在作了事实的对比后，向读者提出了一个问题：为什么美国的经济发展会发生这样显著的缓慢和落后情况，而苏联的经济却会有如此飞速的发展？这确是美国以及所有资本主义国家的人民正在深切关注的一个问题。作者对这个问题的回答是十分明确的，他说：问题的关键就在于体现社会关系的社会制度。在“两种制度的对照”一节中作者关于这一问题的几百字的说明，可以说是全书的总结。
    《人民资本主义批判》是一本引人入胜的书。它有严密的科学性又有强烈的战斗性。同时，文字的生动和通俗，也增强了这本书对读者的吸引力和说服力。
