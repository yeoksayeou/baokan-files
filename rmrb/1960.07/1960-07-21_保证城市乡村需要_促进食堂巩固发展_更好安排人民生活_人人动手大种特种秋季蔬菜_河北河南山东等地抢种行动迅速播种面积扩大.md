　　Guarantee Needs of Cities and Villages, Promote Consolidation and Development of Canteens, Better Arrange People's Lives
　　Everyone Mobilizes to Plant Special Autumn Vegetables
　　Hebei, Henan, Shandong and Other Places Rush to Plant with Rapid Action and Expanded Sowing Area
　　Hebei
　　(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 20th) Responding enthusiastically to the call of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to produce double-thousand catties of vegetables per person, all parts of Hebei Province are seizing the great opportunity to sow vegetables and have launched a high tide of planting vegetables.
　　In the mass vegetable planting campaign, all localities, adhering to the principle of combining extensive planting and high yield, are making every effort to utilize idle land and expand the vegetable sowing area while managing and planting basic vegetable fields well. In Laiyuan County, more than 80,000 commune members, led by more than 1,800 cadres, reclaimed 8,700 mu of mountain slopes and gullies in two days, planting cabbage, radish, and other vegetables. At the same time, they intercropped 12,000 mu of cornfields and sweet potato fields with vegetables and planted more than 14 million cabbage and radish plants on idle land. By July 16, the province had planted 990,000 mu of basic vegetable fields and sown more than 400,000 mu of autumn vegetables on idle land.
　　In order to plant, cultivate, and manage vegetables sufficiently well, a professional vegetable production front has been established from the provincial and municipal levels down to the commune and team levels, with secretaries at all levels taking charge and special personnel responsible. In Shulu and Xinle counties of Shijiazhuang City, the Party committees at all levels have placed vegetable production on their important agenda, established special institutions at each level, and promptly inspected, summarized, and promoted advanced experiences. In Gaoyang County, 437 fourth-level secretaries led more than 1,100 cadres to go deep into the front line of production, combine crop sowing and seedling protection, conduct thorough and meticulous inspections of vegetable planting, and firmly grasp the "four implementations" of land, labor, seeds, and policies, greatly promoting the development of the vegetable planting campaign. By July 4, the county had reclaimed wasteland and used idle land to plant more than 42,000 mu of vegetables.
　　Henan
　　(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 20th) While summer sowing food crops, various parts of Henan Province are vigorously grasping vegetable production. From June 1 to the present, the province has sown 3.38 million mu of various high-yield and storage-resistant autumn vegetables such as red and white radishes and Chinese cabbage. At the same time, field management of the existing more than 10 million mu of spring and summer vegetables has been strengthened in an effort to achieve high yields.
　　The actual cultivated area of spring and summer vegetables in Henan Province is 10.1 million mu, more than double that of last year, with an average of 2.2 li of vegetable land per person. In order to increase vegetable production, a mass campaign to rush-plant autumn vegetables is currently underway in various localities. In the large-scale sowing of autumn vegetables, all localities have conscientiously implemented the principle of extensive planting and high yield. The province's autumn vegetable production plan includes 8.9 million mu of perennial vegetable fields and 6.99 million mu of crop rotation and wasteland planting. While ensuring that each person completes the task of planting vegetables on two fen of cultivated land, various localities are making full use of all "vacant land" and carrying out a "full sky" vegetable planting campaign to expand the sowing area in every possible way. After completing the task of planting vegetables on two fen of cultivated land per person, the Xiayi County Party Committee timely proposed the slogan "Each person reclaims two fen of idle land, and the county reclaims 100,000 mu of waste and idle land," and in six days, the county reclaimed more than 60,000 mu of wasteland for vegetable planting. Fengqiu County launched a campaign of three fen of radish per person, and has currently reclaimed more than 15,000 mu of red and white radishes.
　　At present, more than 10 million mu of spring and summer vegetables in the province have been marketed in large quantities. In the spirit of "focusing on the off-season in the peak season and focusing on winter and spring in summer," various localities are vigorously engaging in vegetable processing and storage. 157 canteens in the Yingju People's Commune of Fengqiu County have built 198 warehouses and stored more than 600,000 jin of dried vegetables.
　　Shandong
　　(Our newspaper, Jinan, 20th) The entire Party and the people of Shandong Province are grasping vegetable production as vigorously as they grasp grain production. A mass campaign is currently taking shape throughout the province to manage summer vegetables well, plant autumn vegetables on a large scale, and strive for a bumper vegetable harvest throughout the year.
　　This year, Shandong Province's climate is very abnormal. There was a severe shortage of rainfall in the first half of the year, and the drought was serious. Recently, some local areas have experienced flooding, and some crops must be replanted. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee issued a call, requiring all localities to seize the current favorable opportunity and vigorously engage in vegetable production. At present, more than 3 million mu of spring and summer vegetables have been planted in the province, and most are growing well. Autumn vegetable sowing is forming a high tide. This year, the province plans to sow 8.5 million to 10 million mu of radishes, melons, vegetables, and feed crops on the fields and some scattered land, with an average of 1.5 to 2 fen of melon and vegetable land per person. The autumn vegetable sowing area in Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Zibo, and other regions has been greatly expanded compared to the same period last year. The famous Jiaoxian cabbage base plans to plant 47,000 mu this year, an increase of 50% over last year, and the plan for commercial vegetables is 30% higher than last year. Rural canteens throughout the province have generally established vegetable production bases, and recently, various localities are mobilizing forces to support professional teams in a concentrated rush to plant autumn vegetables.
　　In order to expand the vegetable planting area as much as possible, various localities have also launched a small summer sowing campaign in which everyone participates and makes full use of vacant land to plant melons and vegetables. According to incomplete statistics from Yantai, Liaocheng, Changwei, and other regions, the small summer sowing area has reached more than 1.16 million mu.

    河北
    本报天津20日电  河北省各地热烈响应省委提出的每人双千斤菜的号召，抓住当前播种蔬菜的大好时机，掀起了大种蔬菜的高潮。
    在大种蔬菜运动中，各地本着广种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，在管好、种好基本菜田的同时，千方百计利用闲散土地，扩大蔬菜播种面积。涞源县八万多名社员，在一千八百多名干部带领下，两天就开垦山坡、山沟八千七百多亩，种上了白菜、萝卜等各种蔬菜，同时在玉米地、甘薯地间作蔬菜一万二千亩，利用闲散地种白菜、萝卜一千四百多万棵。到7月16日，全省已种好基本菜田九十九万亩，利用闲散地播种秋菜四十多万亩。
    为了把蔬菜种够种好管好，从省市到社队都建立起蔬菜生产专业战线，各级书记挂帅，专人负责。石家庄市束鹿、新乐等县，各级党委都把蔬菜生产提到了重要议事日程上，逐级建立了专门机构，及时检查总结，推广先进经验。高阳县四百三十七名四级书记带领一千一百多名干部，深入到生产第一线，结合作物播种保苗，深入细致地进行种菜大检查，狠抓地块、劳力、籽种、政策“四落实”，大大推动了种菜运动的开展。到7月4日，全县已垦荒和利用闲散地种菜四万二千多亩。
    河南
    本报郑州20日电  河南各地在夏播粮食作物的同时，大抓蔬菜生产。全省从6月1日到现在，已播种红、白萝卜、小白菜等各种高产耐贮秋菜三百三十八万亩；同时对现有一千多万亩春、夏菜加强田间管理，力争高产多收。
    河南全省春夏菜实播耕地面积一千零十万亩，比去年扩大一倍多，每人平均有菜地二分二厘。为了增产更多蔬菜，目前各地掀起了抢种秋菜的群众运动。在大搞秋菜播种中，各地都认真执行了广种多收与高产多收的方针。全省秋菜生产计划常年菜田八百九十万亩，粮菜轮作及开荒种菜六百九十九万亩。各地在保证每人完成二分耕地种菜任务的同时，充分利用一切“空闲地”，大搞“满天飞”种菜运动，千方百计扩大播种面积。夏邑县在完成每人二分耕地种菜后，县委适时提出“每人开垦二分闲散地，全县开垦十万亩废闲地”的号召，六天时间全县开荒种菜六万多亩。封丘县开展了每人三分萝卜运动，目前已开荒种红、白萝卜一万五千多亩。
    目前，全省一千多万亩春夏菜已经大量上市，各地本着“旺季看淡季，夏季看冬春”的精神，大搞蔬菜加工和贮存。封丘县应举人民公社一百五十七个食堂，已建仓一百九十八个，储备干菜六十多万斤。
    山东
    本报济南20日电  山东省全党全民像抓粮食一样大抓蔬菜生产。目前正在全省范围内形成一个管好夏菜、大种秋菜，力争全年蔬菜大丰收的群众运动。
    今年山东省气候很不正常，全省上半年雨水奇缺，干旱严重；最近局部地区又出现了涝灾，部分作物必须翻种。为此，中共山东省委发出号召，要求各地抓住当前有利时机，大搞蔬菜生产。目前，全省已种春夏菜三百多万亩，大部生长良好；秋菜播种正在形成高潮。全省今年计划在大田和部分零星地上播种萝卜、瓜菜、饲料等八百五十万亩到一千万亩，平均每人有瓜菜一分半到二分地。青岛、济南、烟台、淄博等地区的秋菜播种面积都比去年同期扩大很多，著名的胶县大白菜基地今年计划种植四万七千亩，比去年种植面积扩大50％，商品菜计划比去年增长30％。全省农村食堂已普遍建立起蔬菜生产基地，最近各地正在调集力量支援专业队突击抢种秋菜。
    为了尽量扩大蔬菜种植面积，各地还展开了人人动手、充分利用空闲地多种瓜菜的小夏播运动。仅据烟台、聊城、昌潍等地区不完全统计，小夏播面积已达一百一十六万多亩。
