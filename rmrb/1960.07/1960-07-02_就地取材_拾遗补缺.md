    "Local Sourcing" and "Picking Up the Pieces"
    Guang Zhi
    A good experience in the great development of industry by urban people's communes in various places is to solve the problem of raw materials and determine products based on the principles of "local sourcing" and "picking up the pieces."
    Why "local sourcing" and "picking up the pieces"? This is dictated by the objective and subjective conditions of commune industry. Commune industry is an assistant to large-scale industry, and its production policy is to serve large factories, to serve the urban people's lives, and to serve agriculture. The main industrial products of the national economy have been incorporated into the state plan and are produced separately by factories in various places. Urban commune industries should mainly produce things that large industries cannot take care of or manage for the time being. Therefore, it can be small parts, small hardware, daily necessities, small commodities, small farm tools, pesticides, and other varied and diverse items. Precisely because of this, the raw materials needed by commune industries are bound to be scattered and diverse. These raw materials should, of course, be mainly sourced locally. If they are to be allocated from all directions, it will inevitably cause a waste of manpower and materials. Once the raw materials are not supplied, production will be suspended, affecting production. Is "local sourcing" possible? "Local sourcing" does indeed have materials to take, and it is "inexhaustible." For example, the Zhengzhou Red Flag People's Commune used a plot of more than 100 acres of barren saline-alkali land near it to set up a not-so-small chemical factory. All localities have unique raw materials that are relatively convenient to use and can also save manpower and materials. In addition, in cities, due to industrial concentration and population concentration, there are many discarded items such as scrap materials, waste water, waste residue, and waste gas. According to the principle of the conservation of matter, there is no real "waste" in nature. Scrap materials can be used to make small commodities; other "waste" can be turned into treasures through comprehensive utilization, can be used in multiple ways, can be used in small ways, can be used in big ways, and can enable every kind of material to serve socialist construction to the greatest possible extent. The Suzhou River in Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of tons of industrial wastewater flowing into it every day. According to the preliminary analysis of the No. 1 State-owned Printing and Dyeing Factory, the 8,000 tons of wastewater discharged into the Suzhou River by just one factory contains at least 15 tons of various usable materials. Now, there are already dozens of factories here that are using the wastewater and waste liquid from various factories for production. The Hui Dui People's Commune, organized around the State-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, has set up nine "satellite factories," trying every possible means to utilize the waste materials and scraps from the paper mill. The raw materials come continuously from the production of large factories, and the products they produce are just the items that large factories and the market need, so they are developing rapidly.
    From the above situation, "local sourcing" and "picking up the pieces" for commune-run industries should not only be done, but can also be done. Correctly implementing this principle will promote the development of urban commune-run industries more quickly, create a large amount of wealth for the country, and benefit the people. Let commune-run industries shine brightly!

    “就地取材”“拾遗补缺”
    广之
    各地城市人民公社大办工业中的一条好经验就是解决原料、确定产品要根据“就地取材”、“拾遗补缺”的原则。
    为什么要“就地取材”“拾遗补缺”呢？这是公社工业主客观条件所规定的。公社工业是大工业的助手，它的生产方针是为大工厂服务、为城市人民生活服务和为农业服务。国民经济的主要工业产品，已经纳入国家计划，分头由各地工厂生产。城市公社工业主要应当生产大工业一时顾不上、管不了的东西。因此，可以是小零件、小五金，可以是生活日用品、小百货，可以是小农具、农药等五花八门、各种各样的东西。也正因为是这样，公社工业所需的原材料必然是零零星星，种类繁多。这种原材料，当然要以就地取材为主。如果要从四面八方调拨，必然造成人力物力的浪费。一旦原料供不上，还要停工待料，影响生产。就地取材，有没有可能呢？“就地取材”，的确是有材可取，而且是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的。像郑州红旗人民公社，利用附近一百多亩地的一片不立苗的硝土地，就办起了一个不小的化工厂。各地都有本地所特有的原料，利用起来比较方便，也能节省人力物力。此外，在城市里，由于工业集中，人口集中，边角废料、废水、废渣、废气等废弃之物很多。根据物质不灭的原理，自然界没有真正的“废物”。边角、废料，可以用来制作小商品；其他“废物”一经综合利用，就可以变成宝物，可以变一用为多用，变小用为大用，能使每一种物资尽最大可能地为社会主义建设服务。上海的苏州河，每天有数十万吨的工业废水流入，据国营第一印染厂的初步分析，仅该厂一个厂子每天排入苏州河的八千吨废水，至少含有各种可用物资十五吨。现在，这里已经有数十个工厂利用各厂的废水废液在生产。以国营天津造纸总厂为中心组织起来的灰堆人民公社，办起了九个“卫星工厂”，千方百计地利用造纸厂的废料和下脚料，原料随大工厂的生产源源而来，他们生产的产品又都是大工厂和市场上正需要的物品，因而发展很快。
    从以上情况来看，社办工业“就地取材”“拾遗补缺”，不仅应该做到，而且是能够做到的。正确地贯彻这条原则，就能更快地促进城市社办工业的发展，就能给国家创造大量的财富，造福于人民。让社办工业大放奇光异彩吧！
