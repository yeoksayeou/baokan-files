　　Promote the Communist Spirit of Collaboration in Developing Agriculture
　　Linxi County, Inner Mongolia, Fully Supports the Development of Agriculture in West Ujimqin Banner
　　Linfen County, Shanxi, Coordinates Mutual Cooperation Between Waterlogged and Drought-Stricken Areas to Complete the Task of Expanding Summer Planting
Xinhua News Agency report: Linxi County, an agricultural area in the Zhaowuda League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and West Ujimqin Banner, a purely pastoral area in the Xilingol League, are carrying out large-scale cooperation focused on agriculture to comprehensively support pastoral production, further accelerating the construction of various undertakings in the pastoral area, and further consolidating the new national relations of socialist unity and mutual assistance.
　　The Mongolian and Han people living in these two adjacent banners and counties have had increasingly close ties since the realization of people's communes in 1958. The Mongolian herders in West Ujimqin Banner felt that to develop animal husbandry production at high speed, it was necessary to vigorously develop agriculture; while the Han farmers in Linxi County also felt that to further develop agricultural production, they also needed the support of pastureland and draught animals from the Mongolian herders in West Ujimqin Banner. Therefore, large-scale cooperation was extensively carried out from the banner and county levels to the people's communes. After nearly two years, large-scale cooperation has promoted the great development of various productions in the two banners and counties, especially laying a solid foundation for changing the single animal husbandry economy in the pastoral area and gradually moving towards a diversified economy of "livestock farming as the mainstay, combining agriculture and animal husbandry" and simultaneously developing industry and forestry. Since 1958, when Linxi County first sent more than 100 Han farmers and a complete set of Han cadres to the pastoral area to help reclaim wasteland and sow grain, feed, and vegetables, large numbers of manpower, production tools, and seeds have been continuously sent to provide support. Therefore, this pastoral area has seen its grain and feed crop planting area increase sharply from more than 50,000 mu last year to 400,000 mu this year, an increase of more than 100 times compared to the more than 3,000 mu before the large-scale cooperation began in 1958. At present, on the grasslands of the entire banner, which stretch more than 35,000 square kilometers, one can see lush wheat, naked oats, buckwheat, millet, corn, and vegetables. If there are no particularly severe natural disasters by the autumn harvest, the grain and feed produced by the entire banner this year will be sufficient for self-sufficiency with a surplus. West Ujimqin Banner has also made great strides in industrial production. Since the start of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, Linxi County has sent Han technical workers to help Mongolian herders learn the technology of building furnaces and making iron. By the end of last year, 34 tons of pig iron had been produced. A large number of manpower has also been provided to support the construction of other new factories and mines, as well as some service industries such as catering and hairdressing. Now, on the basis of the past few blacksmith shops and a small number of carpentry shops, the banner's industry has established 49 factories and mines including electricity, iron smelting, machinery, coal mining, coking, leather, bricks and tiles, lime, wood processing, dairy products, and feed processing.
　　The great development of agriculture and industry has created favorable conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. So far this year, the banner has produced more than 270,000 young animals, and the survival rate has increased from 89% last year to 91.5%. The livestock loss rate has also decreased from 8.3% in 1959 to 6.2%. Therefore, the total livestock breeding rate this year reached more than 30%, an increase of more than 4% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1959.
　　With the large-scale cooperation in production, the great unity between the Mongolian and Han people has been further strengthened. During the spring plowing season this year, West Ujimqin Banner was short of labor, and the planting season was approaching, but the seeds had not yet been transported to the pastoral area. Upon hearing this, the Han farmers in Linxi County promptly extracted more than 500 ox carts and a large number of laborers from the tense spring sowing and transported more than 400,000 jin of seeds to the pastoral area. Last year, in order to further build a new pastoral area, nearly 1,000 Han farmers from Linxi County went to the pastoral area to build more than 1,600 houses, helping 85% of the herders in the three communes to realize settlement. Now, with the help of Han farmers, the Mongolian herders in West Ujimqin Banner have learned some techniques in farming and industrial production. In order to thank the Han farmers in Linxi County, in addition to giving the Han farmers pastures to graze more than 7,000 heads of livestock and teaching the Han farmers to learn about grazing and dairy production knowledge, they also supported a batch of excellent breeding livestock to promote the development of animal husbandry production in the agricultural area.
Xinhua News Agency report: The broad masses of cadres and members in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, in the anti-drought campaign, have established a sense of the overall situation, promoted a style of collaboration, and provided mutual support between waterlogged and drought-stricken areas, successfully completing the task of expanding summer planting in a situation of severe drought.
　　Linfen County is a key wheat-producing county, with the Fen River running through the entire area, dividing the county into two parts: the east and west of the river. The eastern part is mostly dry land, and the western part is mostly paddy field. Since the sowing of winter wheat last year, the county has not had a thorough rain for more than nine months. After the wheat harvest, the county quickly launched a campaign to expand the summer planting area by promoting autumn with summer and supplementing summer with autumn. However, the increasingly severe drought directly threatened the progress of summer planting.
　　In view of the fact that the seven communes in the dryland areas in the east of the river were trying their best to combat drought and plant seeds, but progress was slow, on the other hand, the four communes in the west of the river had sufficient water sources, but due to insufficient labor, they were unable to plant 100,000 mu of paddy field. Therefore, the county party committee decided to make unified plans for the entire county, break down community boundaries, adapt to local conditions, and engage in large-scale cooperation between waterlogged and drought-stricken areas. Cadres and members of the communes actively responded to this measure. A mass cooperative anti-drought rush planting campaign to win a greater autumn harvest was quickly launched throughout the county. The Shi Cun, Cheng Shi, and other communes and management areas organized 32,000 laborers, 2,500 livestock, 25 tractors, and 1,000 large vehicles to cross the Fen River to support the water-rich areas in a concentrated rush to replant. In order to give full play to the role of water conservancy, the communes in the water-rich areas divided a part of the wheat fields for the water-deficient areas to borrow for replanting. According to incomplete statistics, the two communes of Nan Xin Dian and Long Ci and the thirteen management areas of Dong Guo, Dong Yuan, etc., have lent 31,000 mu of paddy field to the Shi Cun, Cheng Shi, Wei Cun, Yu Li, and other communes and management areas. The members happily praised this matter and said: "The drought is increasing day by day, and the cooperation is getting deeper and deeper. Planting a good harvest of grain and sowing the seeds of friendship." Due to the large-scale cooperation between the communes in the east and west of the river, and the large-scale support from industry, transportation, commerce, education, military, and people, from June 15th to 21st, in six days, the county rushed to plant 80,000 mu of late autumn crops, and the daily planting progress was 1.1 times faster than before. At present, the county has replanted 218,000 mu of autumn crops, accounting for 72.7% of the replanting plan, which not only guarantees the realization of the expanded replanting plan, but also most of the replanting is done in paddy fields, which provides a strong guarantee for continuous drought resistance and supplementing summer with autumn. After the large-scale cooperation between the communes in the waterlogged and drought-stricken areas to replant, the labor force in the rear of the dryland areas concentrated its efforts on combating drought and protecting seedlings, which effectively promoted the field management of large autumn crops. Under the slogan of "Seedlings will not die in a severe drought, everyone guarantees one mu," the Da Yang Commune mobilized men, women, old and young, and watered and point-irrigated 1,543 mu of autumn seedlings in three days, greatly improving the withered seedlings. Up to now, the county has carried water to irrigate 50,000 mu of autumn seedlings and carried out secondary cultivation to preserve moisture on 150,000 mu. At the same time, the broad masses of people have also used scattered vacant lots to plant 95,000 mu of small grains and vegetables. (Attached picture)

　　在发展农业中大兴共产主义协作之风
　　内蒙古林西县全面支援西乌珠穆沁旗发展农业
　  山西临汾县水旱地区互相协作完成扩大夏种任务
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟农业区林西县，和锡林郭勒盟纯牧区西乌珠穆沁旗，开展以农业为主全面支援牧区生产的大协作，进一步加快了牧区各项事业的建设，团结互助的社会主义的新民族关系也更加得到巩固。
    居住在这两个毗邻旗县的蒙汉族人民，1958年实现人民公社化后，联系日益密切。西乌珠穆沁旗的蒙古族牧民，感到要高速度发展畜牧业生产，必须大力发展农业；而林西县的汉族农民也感到要进一步发展农业生产，也需要西乌珠穆沁旗蒙古族牧民给以牧场耕畜等支援。于是从旗县到人民公社广泛开展了大协作。经过近两年的时间，大协作已经促进了两个旗县各项生产的大发展，特别是对改变牧区单一的畜牧业经济，逐步走向“以牧为主，农牧结合”和工业、林业同时发展的多种经济打下巩固的基础。从1958年林西县第一次派出一百多个汉族农民和配备成套的汉族干部到牧区帮助开荒播种粮食、饲料和蔬菜之后，每年便接连不断地派出大批人力，调出生产工具和种籽进行支援，因此，这个牧业区今年粮食和饲料作物的播种面积，已由去年的五万多亩猛增到四十万亩，比起1958年未开展大协作以前的三千多亩增加一百多倍。目前，在全旗纵横三万五千多平方公里的草原上，到处能见到油绿的小麦、莜麦、荞麦、谷子、糜子、玉米和蔬菜等农作物。如果至秋收没有特大的自然灾害，今年全旗生产的粮食饲料将能达到自给有余。西乌珠穆沁旗在工业生产上也得到突飞猛进，从1958年大炼钢铁起，林西县便派出汉族技术工人，帮助蒙古族牧民，学习建炉和炼铁的技术，到去年底已炼出生铁三十四吨。在兴建其他一些新的厂矿以及饮食、理发等一些服务性的行业，也给以大批人力的支援。现在全旗工业在过去几个铁匠炉和少数木匠铺的基础上，已建立起电力、炼铁、机械、采煤、炼焦、皮毛、砖瓦、石灰、木材加工、乳品和饲料加工等四十九个厂矿。
    农业和工业生产的大发展，为高速度发展畜牧业生产创造了有利条件，今年全旗畜牧业生产到目前为止，已接仔畜二十七万多头，成活率由去年的89％提高到91.5％。牲畜的损失率也由1959年的8.3％减少到6.2％，因此今年牲畜总增殖率达到30％多，比大跃进的1959年增加了4％以上。
    随着生产上的大协作，又进一步加强了蒙汉族人民间的大团结。今年春耕时期，西乌珠穆沁旗劳力缺乏，播种季节快过籽种还没有运到牧区。林西县的汉族农民闻讯后，在紧张的春播中，及时抽出五百多辆牛车和大批劳动力，并将四十多万斤种籽赶运到牧区。去年为了进一步建设新牧区，林西县又有近千名汉族农民，到牧区修建了一千六百多间房屋，帮助三个公社85％的牧民实现了定居。现在，西乌珠穆沁旗的蒙古族牧民在汉族农民的帮助下，已经学会了种地和工业生产上的一些技术活，他们为了感谢林西县的汉族农民，除了将牧场给汉族农民牧放七千多头牲畜，和教汉族农民学会放牧和乳品生产的知识外，还支援一批优良种公畜，以促进农业区畜牧业生产的发展。
    本报讯　山西省临汾县广大干部和社员在抗旱运动中，树立全局观点，大兴协作风格，水旱地区互相支援，在严重干旱情况下，出色地完成扩大夏种任务。
    临汾县是个产麦重点县，汾河纵贯全境，把全县分为河东河西两大部分。河东大部分是旱地，河西大部分是水地。这个县从去年播种冬小麦开始以来，九个多月未落透雨，在麦收以后，全县迅速展开了以夏促秋、以秋补夏的扩大夏种面积的运动。但是，日趋严重的旱象，直接威胁着夏种工作的进行。
    县委鉴于河东旱土地区七个公社想尽办法抗旱下种，进展缓慢；另一方面河西地区四个公社水源充足，却因劳力不足，仍有十万亩水地无力下种。因此，县委决定全县统一规划，打破社区界线，因地制宜，大搞水旱地区的协作。各公社干部和社员积极响应了这一措施。一个为夺取秋季更大丰收的全民协作抗旱抢种突击运动很快就在全县开展起来。史村、城市等公社和管理区组织了三万二千个劳力，两千五百头牲口，二十五台拖拉机和一千辆大车跨过汾河，支援水源充足地区突击复播；有水地区的公社为了充分发挥水利作用，分出一部分麦田，让给缺水地区借用复播。据不完整统计，南辛店、龙祠两个公社和东郭、东元等十三个管理区，已借给史村、城市等公社和魏村、峪里等管理区水地三万一千亩。社员们高兴地赞扬这件事说：旱象日日增，协作情更深，种上丰收粮，播下友谊种。由于全县河东、河西地区公社大协作，工交商学兵大支援，从6月15日到21日六天中，全县即抢种晚秋作物八万亩，日播进度较前加快了一点一倍。目前全县已复种秋作物二十一万八千亩，占到了复播计划的72.7％，不仅保证了扩大复种计划的实现，同时绝大部分复播在水地里，这为持续抗旱、以秋补夏提供了有力的保证。水旱地区公社大协作复播以后，旱土地区后方劳力集中力量抗旱保苗，有力地促进了大秋作物田间管理。大阳公社在“大旱不死苗，每人保一亩”的口号下，男女老少总动员，三天即担水点浇秋苗一千五百四十三亩，使枯萎禾苗大有好转。到目前为止，全县共担水浇灌秋苗五万亩，二次中耕保墒十五万亩。与此同时，广大群众还利用零散空地种植小杂粮、蔬菜九万五千亩。（附图片）
