Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th: Hebei Province's industrial and agricultural spare-time education, on the basis of great development, great popularization, and great improvement, is actively carrying out teaching reforms, so that spare-time education is closely integrated with the technical revolution and the agricultural technical transformation movement, accelerating the pace of training technical forces.

    With the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the vast number of factories, mines, and urban and rural people's communes all require the rapid training of large numbers of technical workers and technical cadres, and the broad masses of people also urgently demand to rapidly improve their scientific and technological cultural level to meet the needs of the new situation development. Therefore, the cultural revolution upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running spare-time education in Hebei Province has had new development. At present, the number of people participating in spare-time study in the province has reached 8.58 million, and more than 5 million people have been eliminated from illiteracy in the past two years. Among workers, the non-illiterate have reached about 90%, and spare-time elementary education has been popularized, and secondary and higher education are being run on a large scale. The non-illiterate among farmers have also reached 70% to 75%, and spare-time elementary education has also developed greatly. Many factories and mines have established spare-time education networks from primary school to university. In Tianjin alone, the number of workers participating in secondary specialized studies this year has increased more than twofold compared with the end of 1959, and those participating in higher specialized studies have increased by one and a half times. The masses are spreading the word: "Spare-time education is a complete system, after finishing senior primary school, you go to junior secondary school, through three years combined with five years, everyone is a college student."

    In the spare-time education reform, Hebei Province has further implemented the policy of "integrating with production, unified planning, teaching students according to their aptitude, flexible and diverse," so that spare-time education is further integrated with production practice, better adapting to the needs of technical innovation and technical revolution and the urgent demands of workers and peasants. The forms of running schools are also diverse, from factories and mines running schools, communes and production teams running schools, to workshops running schools, offices running schools, high-yield fields running schools, and so on. Teaching is closely integrated with industrial technological innovation, technological revolution, and agricultural technological transformation. On-site teaching was conducted in factories, mines, water conservancy construction sites, and fertile fields, so that wherever there is production, there is learning. Teachers have gone out of the classroom, into the workshops, and deep into the front lines. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, they jointly participated in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with workers, peasants, and technicians. There has emerged "three-way combination" for compiling teaching materials, "three-way combination" for preparing lessons, and "three-way combination" for lecturing, which has greatly improved the quality of teaching and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants. Many spare-time schools closely combine the study of theoretical knowledge with breaking through production bottlenecks and carrying out scientific research, making workshops and fertile fields new types of bases that are both production units, teaching places, and scientific research institutions. More than 20 veteran workers in the casting industry spare-time university class of Tianjin Tractor Factory, after completing their professional theory, conducted experiments and immediately put them into production after success. The veteran workers and all the workers in the workshop together, in a short period of time, increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the workshop from the original 70% to more than 90%, and also successfully trial-produced some cutting-edge products. Many spare-time schools have become command posts for technical innovation, and teachers and students have become shock troops in production and vanguards in technical innovation.

    In view of the specific characteristics of workers and peasants mastering scientific, technological, and cultural knowledge, many units in Hebei Province have greatly broken the old teaching system in the arrangement of teaching content and established a new teaching system with majors as the outline and majors leading the foundation. It combines solving the current production needs with systematically improving the scientific, technological, and cultural level, and pays attention to making different requirements for different objects and different arrangements at different stages. The Tianjin Electric Appliance Factory, based on the characteristics of the old workers having "three more and three less" (more perceptual knowledge, physical and chemical phenomena, and process knowledge, less rational knowledge, physical and chemical principles, and mathematical and physical calculation knowledge), adopted the teaching method of deriving formulas from production practice, so that the workers quickly mastered professional theoretical knowledge. Some units also divided old workers and old peasants into three stages for teaching: first, starting from the existing level of knowledge, supplementing what is lacking; second, systematically solving production technical problems along the needs of production; third, systematically improving theoretical knowledge and learning some more advanced technical theories. Apprentices are generally required to learn more basic theory and cultural knowledge to lay a good foundation. Farmers with a cultural level below junior primary school are also mainly focused on learning culture to lay the necessary foundation. For some workers and peasants with a higher cultural level, the proportion of professional courses is increased. Large-scale spare-time education focuses on majors. Under the current circumstances that the labor force is relatively tight and the cultural and technical levels of workers and peasants cannot meet the needs of production, attention is first paid to quickly mastering all kinds of knowledge needed for their current production in terms of learning content. On this basis, according to the needs of production development, they will be gradually trained to become all-rounders.

    结合生产  统一安排  因材施  教灵活多样
    河北业余教育积极进行教学改革
    据新华社天津30日电　河北省工农业余教育在大发展、大普及、大提高的基础上，积极地进行教学改革，使业余教育紧紧结合技术革命和农业技术改造运动，加速了培养技术力量的步伐。
    随着技术革新、技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，工农业生产的大跃进，广大的厂矿和城乡人民公社都要求迅速培养大批的技术工人和技术干部，而广大群众也迫切要求迅速提高科学技术文化水平，以适应新形势发展的需要。因而河北省全党全民大办业余教育的文化革命高潮有了新的发展。目前，全省参加业余学习的人数已达到八百五十八万人，两年来扫除文盲五百多万人。在职工当中，非文盲已达到90％左右，而且普及了业余初等教育，正在大办中等和高等教育。农民中的非文盲也达到70％到75％，业余初等教育也有很大的发展。很多厂矿都办起了从小学到大学的业余教育网，仅天津市今年参加中等专业学习的职工就比1959年底增加了二倍以上，参加高等专业学习的增加了一倍半。群众盛传着：“业余教育一条龙，上完高小上初中，通过三年并五载，人人都是大学生”。
    河北省在业余教育改革中，进一步贯彻了“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的方针，使业余教育进一步结合生产实际，更好地适应技术革新、技术革命的需要和工农群众的迫切要求。办学的形式也是多种多样，从厂矿办学、公社与生产队办学发展到车间办学、科室办学、丰产方办学等等。教学紧紧地和工业技术革新、技术革命、农业技术改造结合起来，在厂矿、水利工地和方田中进行了现场教学，作到那里有生产就在那里学习。教师们纷纷走出课堂，下车间，深入现场，在党委领导下，和工农群众、技术人员共同参加到技术革新和技术革命运动中去，出现了“三结合”编教材、“三结合”备课、“三结合”讲课，大大提高了教学质量，受到了广大工农群众的热烈欢迎。许多业余学校把学习理论知识和突破生产关键、开展科学研究密切结合起来，使车间、方田成为既是生产单位，又是教学场所，也是科学研究机构的新型基地。天津市拖拉机制造厂铸工业余大学班二十多名老工人，学完了专业理论就试验，成功后立刻投入生产。老工人和全车间职工一道在短短的时间内，就使车间的机械化半机械化程度，由原来的70％提高到90％以上，而且还试制成功了一些尖端产品。不少业余学校成为技术革新的指挥部，师生变成了生产上的突击手和技术革新的尖兵。
    针对工人和农民掌握科学技术文化知识的具体特点，河北省许多单位在教学内容的安排上，都大破旧的教学体系，建立以专业为纲、专业带基础的新的教学体系，把解决当前生产需要同系统提高科学技术文化水平结合起来，并注意根据不同的对象作不同的要求，在不同阶段作不同安排。天津电器厂根据老工人的三多三少（感性知识、理化现象和工艺知识多，理性知识、理化原理、数理计算知识少）的特点，采取从生产实际中引出公式的教学方法，使工人迅速掌握了专业理论知识。还有些单位对老工人与老农民分成三个阶段进行教学，首先从现有知识水平出发，缺什么补什么；第二，沿着生产需要，系统解决生产技术问题；第三，系统地提高理论知识，学习一些更高级的技术理论。对徒工一般要求多学一些基础理论与文化知识，把基础打好。具有高小文化水平以下的农民，也都以学文化为主，打下必要基础。对一些具有较高文化水平的工人和农民，增加专业课程比重。大专业余教育则以专业为主。在当前劳动力比较紧张，工农群众文化水平、技术水平还不能适应生产需要的实际情况下，在学习内容上首先注意到了迅速精通本人目前生产上所需要的各种知识，在这基础上，根据生产发展的需要，再逐步培养成为多面手。
