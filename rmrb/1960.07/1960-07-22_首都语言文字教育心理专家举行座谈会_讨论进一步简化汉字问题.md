Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: The Ministry of Education, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly invited more than 30 experts in language, writing, education, and psychology on the 18th to discuss the issue of further simplifying Chinese characters.

The symposium was chaired by Hu Yuzhi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee.

Those who spoke at the meeting included: Ding Xilin, Tang Lan, Wei Jianguo, Lu Zhiwei, Shao Lizi, Mao Yuyan, Fu Maoji, Jiang Zhongren, Gao Mingkai, Xiao Zhang, Sun Dexuan, Lü Shuxiang, Ma Xueliang, and others.

The symposium widely expressed opinions on what principles should be adopted for the continued simplification of Chinese characters. A relatively consistent view among them was that the phonetic-semantic principle of Chinese character structure should be utilized as an important method for simplifying Chinese characters in the future. For example, the previously published simplified characters: 肤 (膚) [skin], 达 (達) [reach], 迟 (遲) [late], 态 (態) [attitude], have simple strokes and both meaning-representing "semantic components" and sound-representing "phonetic components," making them easy to write, recognize, and remember. These types of phonetic-semantic characters are most popular among the masses and children.

Many people also pointed out in the symposium that using homophones as substitutes is a good way to simplify Chinese characters and reduce the number of characters. It can be adopted when it does not cause confusion in meaning. For example, the published simplified character "干" [gan] is used to replace both the "gan" in "ganbu" (干部) [cadre] and the "gan" in "ganshi" (乾湿) [dry and wet]. In literacy teaching and use, it does not cause confusion. The meanings of words such as "ganbu" (干部) [cadre], "gugan" (骨干) [backbone], "ganjing" (干净) [clean], and "ganhan" (干旱) [drought] are clear.

    首都语言文字教育心理专家举行座谈会
    讨论进一步简化汉字问题
    据新华社21日讯　教育部、中国文字改革委员会、中国科学院语言研究所和心理研究所在18日联合邀集语言、文字、教育、心理等方面的专家三十多人，座谈了进一步简化汉字的问题。
    座谈会由中国文字改革委员会副主任胡愈之主持。
    在会上发言的有：丁西林、唐兰、魏建功、陆志韦、邵力子、茅于燕、傅懋勣、蒋仲仁、高名凯、萧璋、孙德宣、吕叔湘、马学良等人。
    座谈会针对继续简化汉字采取什么原则，广泛发表了意见。他们之中比较一致的意见，认为应当尽量利用汉字结构的形声原则，作为今后简化汉字的重要办法。例如，过去公布的简化字：肤（膚）、达（達）、迟（遲）、态（態），笔画简单，既有表意的“义符”，又有表音的“声符”，易写易认易记，这类形声字最受群众和儿童的欢迎。
    许多人在座谈中还指出：同音代替是简化汉字和减少汉字字数的一个好办法，在不引起意义混淆的情况下可以采用。例如，已公布的简化字“干”，既代替幹部的幹，又代替乾湿的乾，在识字教学和使用过程中，并不会混淆，“干部”“骨干”“干净”“干旱”等词的意义是明确的。
