Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 30th—After the establishment of the Qingdao Municipal Production Relief Committee, it assisted all parties in carrying out production relief work, and has initially resolved the living difficulties of the city's existing unemployed workers, poor citizens, and suburban and foreign disaster victims. As of the 15th of this month, more than 10,000 people have been organized to participate in 17 cooperatives for production and self-salvation. Based on the diversified characteristics of urban production work and the different conditions of urban and suburban areas, dozens of production self-salvation groups have been established in the 17 cooperatives, including net fishing, mending sacks, fishing, pasting matchboxes, burning kilns, and knitting hairnet lace. For example, the income from the manure drying and coal ash picking production groups of the Dongtaiping Village Cooperative in Si Cang District can solve the lives of the vast majority of disaster households in the entire village; the Shinan District Cooperative organizes women to collect scrap cotton from the China Textile Company. More than 3,000 people participated in municipal engineering projects such as dredging rivers and building docks, and more than 4,000 people dried and milled grain for state-owned enterprises, all of whom solved their own living difficulties through labor. At the same time, the Municipal People's Government also promoted job placement and the repatriation of disaster victims from other places to their hometowns. 2,397 unemployed people were employed through job placement, and 1,170 disaster victims from other places were repatriated to their hometowns for production. For those who truly had no ability to produce, their difficulties were partially resolved through social mutual assistance and government relief. In the process of launching production self-salvation work, responsible cadres of the Municipal Military Control Commission, the Municipal People's Government, and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China personally participated in inspection teams to conduct in-depth investigations in various districts. The Municipal People's Government also allocated 500,000 jin of corn as production funds for cooperatives, and another 1,130,000 jin as work-relief grain. People from all walks of life also demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance and love, donating more than 1 billion yuan in Renminbi and more than 170,000 jin of grain from April 25th to May 11th.

　　青岛组织失业工人等
    参加合作社生产自救
    【新华社青岛三十日电】青岛市生产救济委员会成立后，协助各方开展生产救济工作，现已初步解决了本市现有失业工人、贫苦市民及郊区和外来灾民的生活困难。截至本月十五日止，已组织一万余人参加十七个合作社进行生产自救。根据城市生产工作多样化的特点和城市与郊区的不同条件，十七个合作社中成立了结鱼网，补麻袋、捕鱼、糊火柴盒、烧窑、结发网花边等数十种生产自救小组。如四沧区东太平村合作社的晒粪干、拣煤灰等生产小组的收益，可以解决全村绝大部分灾户的生活；市南区合作社则组织妇女到中纺公司采下脚废棉。参加疏河、修筑码头等市政工程的有三千余人，替公营企业晒粮和磨粮的有四千余人，都以劳力解决了自己的生活困难。同时，市人民政府还推行了职业介绍和遣送外地灾民回籍的工作。失业者经介绍就业的有二千三百九十七人，遣送回籍生产的外地灾民有一千一百七十人。对确无生产能力的人，通过社会互济和政府救济，也部分解决了他们的困难。在发动生产自救工作的过程中，市军管会、市人民政府、中共青岛市委员会的负责干部，都曾亲自参加视察组深入各区调查。市人民政府并拨出苞米五十万斤作为合作社的生产资金，另一百一十三万余斤作为工赈粮。各界人民也表现了互济的友爱精神，从四月二十五日到五月十一日，共捐集了人民币十亿余元和粮食十七万余斤。
