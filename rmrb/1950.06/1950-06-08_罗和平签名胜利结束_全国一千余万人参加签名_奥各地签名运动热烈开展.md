    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特六日讯：罗马尼亚和平签名运动已告胜利结束。全国已有一千零四万八千六百七十人在世界拥护和平大会常委会宣言上签了名。
    罗京布加勒斯特各机关团体和平委员会的八千余会员，为此特于五日举行盛大的庆祝大会。罗马尼亚常设和平委员会主席康斯坦丁尼斯库——雅西向大会报告了和平签名运动的结果。
    依照罗马尼亚常设和平委员会的决议，全国和平大会定九月上半月举行。
    【新华社七日讯】据电通社维也纳讯：奥地利拥护和平委员会四日宣布：奥地利全国各地已有三十余万人在和平宣言上签了名。在奥地利首都维也纳一地，签名的即已达十五万余人。这个结果，证明首都人民每天平均以一万多人的签名，回答了奥地利政府五月廿三日所通过的反对和平运动的决议。
    “自由奥地利青年”在征集签名中起了很大作用，其所属各级组织，在各地已征集了二万三千多人签名。
