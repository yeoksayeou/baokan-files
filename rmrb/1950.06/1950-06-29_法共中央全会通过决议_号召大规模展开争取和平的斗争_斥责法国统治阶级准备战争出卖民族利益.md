Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 26th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session and passed a resolution severely condemning the French ruling class’s policy of preparing for war and selling out national interests. The resolution calls on the entire party to launch a peace signature campaign on a larger mass scale, and suggests that the people of the entire country hold mass demonstrations on July 14th, the French National Day, to support the struggle for peace.

　　The resolution points out: The acceleration of war preparations and the restoration of a wartime economy within the framework of the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have led to the stagnation and reduction of peaceful production, increased unemployment, increased budget deficits, and reduced the purchasing power of the working people. The Schuman Plan, instigated by the American imperialists, consolidates this war economy and will help the revival of fascist and revanchist West Germany. The purpose of the Schuman Plan is to establish a vast arsenal centered on the Ruhr area, accelerate preparations for an anti-Soviet war, and increase the exploitation of the working people.

　　The Central Committee believes that the joint declaration by the French General Confederation of Labor and the Federation of Free German Trade Unions, calling on the working people of France and Germany to take joint action to oppose the Schuman Plan, is an important manifestation of proletarian internationalism and a powerful contribution to the cause of peace.

　　The resolution points out that the leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party have approved the Schuman Plan and continue to serve the imperialists. They bear serious responsibility for preparing for the Third World War. The divisions between the leaders of the British Labour Party and other European right-wing socialist leaders reflect the contradictions between the imperialist countries, and also reflect the competition between Britain and France to act as agents for American imperialism in Europe.

　　The Central Committee condemns the increasingly costly colonial war being waged by the French government in Vietnam, and points out that the colonial war and repressive policies are accompanied by serious violations of democratic freedoms. Hundreds of peace advocates are thrown into prison, while traitors and war criminals are released.

　　The resolution states that the resolutions of the Party's Twelfth National Congress and the previous plenary session of the Central Committee have proved to be correct. Currently, the great struggle for peace and the peace signature campaign are being carried out all over the world. The Central Committee calls on the entire party to launch a political struggle for peace on a larger mass scale, in a more resolute and convincing manner, and to launch signature campaigns in every enterprise, every residential area, and every village.

　　The Central Committee suggests that all people prepare for mass demonstrations on July 14th, in order to turn that day into a great day uniting all people and peace-loving forces, and into a day of struggle for banning atomic bombs and releasing imprisoned peace advocates.

　　法共中央全会通过决议
    号召大规模展开争取和平的斗争
    斥责法国统治阶级准备战争出卖民族利益
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议通过决议，严斥法国统治阶级准备战争和出卖民族利益的政策，号召全党在更大的群众规模上展开和平签名运动，并建议全国人民在七月十四日法国国庆日举行拥护和平斗争的群众性示威。
    决议指出：战争准备的加速和马歇尔计划及北大西洋公约体制内战时经济的恢复，使和平生产陷于停顿和减缩，失业人口增多，预算赤字加大，劳动人民购买力降低。美帝国主义者所策动的舒曼计划，巩固了这种战争经济，并将有助于法西斯主义与复仇主义的西德的复兴。舒曼计划的目的，在于建立以鲁尔为中心的广大兵工厂，加速准备反苏战争，并加重剥削劳动人民。
    中央委员会认为：法国总工会和自由德国工会联合会号召法德两国劳动人民共同行动以反对舒曼计划的联合宣言，是无产阶级国际主义的重要表现和对于和平事业的有力贡献。
    决议指出：右翼社会党的领袖们已经赞同了舒曼计划，继续为帝国主义者服务，他们对于准备第三次世界战争，负有严重的责任。英国工党领袖和其他欧洲国家右翼社会党领袖之间的分歧，反映了帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，也反映了英法两国为争取充当美帝国主义在欧洲的经纪人而发生的竞争。
    中央委员会斥责法国政府所进行的耗费愈来愈大的越南殖民战争，并指出：伴随着殖民地战争和镇压政策的，是对民主自由的严重侵犯。成百的和平拥护者被投入监狱，而卖国贼和战犯反而被释放出来。
    决议称：党的第十二次代表大会和上届中央委员会全会的决议，已经证明是正确的。目前，争取和平的伟大斗争与和平签名运动，正在全世界各地开展着。中央委员会号召全党，以更为坚决和更有说服力的方法，在更大的群众规模上展开争取和平的政治斗争，使每一个企业、每一个住宅区和乡村，都展开签名运动。
    中央委员会建议一切人民准备七月十四日的群众性示威，以便把那一天变成联合一切人民与爱好和平力量的伟大日子，变成争取禁止原子弹和释放狱中的和平拥护者的斗争日子。
