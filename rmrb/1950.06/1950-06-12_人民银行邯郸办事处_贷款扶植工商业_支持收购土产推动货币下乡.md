The People's Bank of China, Handan Office:

Loans Support Industry and Commerce

Support the Purchase of Native Products and Drive Currency to the Countryside

[This newspaper Handan News] The People's Bank of China, Handan Office, in May, organized currency to go to the countryside through various loans, and gave special consideration to the temporary difficulties of legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises.

The office, in view of the general feeling of currency shortage in the vast rural areas, decided in May to release currency through loans and purchases. A total of 169.3 million yuan was released to 35 industrial and commercial enterprises in one month. Among them, industry accounted for 52 percent and commerce accounted for 48 percent; public enterprises accounted for 23.5 percent and private enterprises accounted for 76.5 percent. Among the industrial loans, the iron, weaving, and oil pressing industries were mainly supported. For example, Yufeng, Xiexing, Deji, and three other iron enterprises received loans of 20.5 million yuan, and then went to Anyang and Shijiazhuang to purchase pig iron for the manufacture of waterwheels after the wheat harvest. The weaving industry had poor sales, and six enterprises had stopped work or were preparing to close in April. However, with the support of bank loans for yarn, 16 enterprises, including Hongfeng and Yongsheng, have now started production.

In addition, in order to get currency to the countryside and increase farmers' income, the office supported the public Yinnong Oil Factory in purchasing rapeseed in the countryside, with a total loan of 40 million yuan. In terms of commerce, the office mainly supported exporters, such as lending 20 million yuan to the private Tianjin Yongheng Company to purchase peanuts and 7.75 million yuan to purchase fresh eggs. Another 40 million yuan was loaned to Tongyi Pharmacy and other porcelain, iron, and bamboo goods merchants to combine private capital and go to producing areas to purchase and transport goods.

　　人民银行邯郸办事处
    贷款扶植工商业
    支持收购土产推动货币下乡
    【本报邯郸讯】人民银行邯郸办事处五月份通过各种贷款，组织货币下乡，并特别照顾了正当私营工商业的暂时困难。
    该处因鉴于广大农村普遍感到货币缺乏，遂决定五月份通过贷款和收购投放货币，计一个月内共放给三十五户工商业贷款计一亿六千九百三十万元。其中工业占百分之五十二，商业占百分之四十八；公营占百分之二三·五，私营占百分之七六·五。在工业贷款中，主要扶植了铁、织布和榨油等工业。如铁业中裕丰、协兴、德记等六家，贷款二千零五十万元后，即到安阳、石家庄收购生铁，以便麦收后制造水车。织布业因销路不畅，四月间曾有六家停工和准备歇业，但经银行贷纱扶植，现已有鸿丰、永盛等十六家开工生产。
    又，该处为使货币下乡，增加农民收入，曾支持了公营益农油厂下乡收购菜籽，共贷款四千万元。商业方面，主要扶植出口商，如贷给天津私营永恒公司二千万元收购落花生，七百五十万元收购鲜蛋。另给通益药栈及其他磁、铁、竹货商贷款四千万元，结合私人资本分赴产地收购贩运。
