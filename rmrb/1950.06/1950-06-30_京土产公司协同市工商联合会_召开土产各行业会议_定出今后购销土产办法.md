　　Beijing Native Produce Company, in Coordination with the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Convenes Meeting of Various Native Produce Industries
    Determines Future Methods for Purchasing and Selling Native Produce
    [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Company of the China Native Produce Company, in coordination with the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, convened a meeting on June 20th with relevant native produce industries in the city, including dried and fresh fruits, stone powder, soap making, dried fruits and seafood, bricks and tiles, and pigments. The meeting discussed the current sales situation of native products from various regions in Beijing and estimated future sales volumes. It was decided that for native products from various regions that have sales in Beijing but are beyond the purchasing capacity of private merchants, the Native Produce Company will uniformly purchase them. Public and private commercial firms and trading houses in various industries will be responsible for promoting sales through consignment relationships. For native products that are industrial raw materials, the Native Produce Company will directly supply them to factories after purchasing. Currently, each industry is preparing sales plans to be submitted to the Native Produce Company for review and unified procurement. Specific sales methods will be determined after individual consultations between the Native Produce Company and merchants in each industry.

　　京土产公司协同市工商联合会
    召开土产各行业会议
    定出今后购销土产办法
    【本报讯】中国土产公司北京市公司协同市工商联合会于六月二十日召集该市干鲜果、石粉、造胰、干果海味、砖瓦、颜料等有关土产行业举行会议。会中交谈了各地土产品目前在京市的销售情况，对今后销售量作了估计。并决定凡在京有销路的各地土产品而私商收购力所不及者，由土产公司统一收购，各业公私营商号行栈以代销关系负责推销，有关工业原料的土产，土产公司收购后直接供给工厂。现各业即将分别制订推销计划，交土产公司汇总考虑统一购进。具体推销办法将由土产公司与各行商个别交换意见后决定。
