News Writing Should Consider Convenience for Reading and Listening
　　Zhu Wenshu
    The first issue of "News Work" reprinted an instructive text: "Correcting Several Technical Flaws in News Writing." This was a telegram sent by the Xinhua News Agency Headquarters to all general branches, branches, and forwarded to all newspaper editorial and reporter comrades on December 9, 1948. The gist of the telegram was that "many dialects, specialized terms, abbreviations...etc. are frequently used in the manuscripts received from various places; and many ambiguous or misused terms are often used; the sentence structure and grammar are often incomplete, some lacking subjects, some lacking objects, and some using the wrong verbs or adjectives: these problems greatly increase the degree of ambiguity in the meaning of the text. In the future, we must correct this chaotic phenomenon in language and writing. The principle of all our published texts must be that the vast majority of readers can fully understand it." The editor of "News Work" said in a note: "The technical flaws in the language of news manuscripts pointed out in this telegram continue to appear in newspapers over the past year. …This is a matter of writing style that concerns millions of people. We hope that comrades in the news industry will first pay attention to this issue and correct these technical flaws in writing."

    Newspapers speak to the masses and are meant for the people to read. If there are ambiguous places in the meaning of the text in the newspaper, and the vast majority of readers cannot understand it, or will have doubts and misunderstandings after reading it, it will weaken the newspaper's propaganda and educational role.

    The records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency are to be used by local newspapers. Mr. Hu Qiaomu said in his report at the National News Work Conference: "The manuscripts of Xinhua News Agency need to be further improved in terms of political and textual level, so that it is more convenient for newspapers across the country to use them." If there are ambiguous places in the meaning of the text in the records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency, local newspaper workers will encounter many difficulties when using them, "summarizing or giving popular explanations" to them. Especially in remote areas, if there are difficulties, writing letters to ask will be too late; checking books, there are not many reference books; only doubt for a while, guess for a while, or delete it, or explain it vaguely. As a result, I am afraid that misunderstandings will be transmitted, reducing the efficiency of propaganda and education.

    The People's Daily also encourages readers to organize reading groups. The task of the reading group is to "publicize the content of the newspaper to the masses." If there are ambiguous places in the meaning of the text in the newspaper, the activists of the reading group will also encounter many difficulties when publicizing the content of the newspaper to the masses. Yu Hua wrote in "The Reading Group of Donghe Village (belonging to Linyi County) (reading the Dazhong Daily and the Luzhong Daily)" in October 1945: "Because when they read, they mostly like to read world affairs, and the names of people and places are so long, difficult to understand, and difficult to remember, everyone can't listen to it; in addition, the words and sentences in the newspaper are not popular, they don't explain them, and they keep reading without connecting the breath or the sentence, everyone is even less interested, and people run away before they finish reading. The listeners don't want to listen, and the readers feel it is an extra burden. In this way, the reading group slowly collapsed." Reading this passage, we can know that the reading groups in the countryside encountered some textual obstacles in news dispatches, how difficult it was for the readers, how difficult it was for the audience to understand, and how uninterested they were. Now, the activists of the reading group do not all have good literacy skills, the more ambiguous the meaning of the text in the newspaper, the greater their difficulties, and the smaller the role of the reading group.

    At present, there are still very many illiterates in our country, "spoken" propaganda is more important than "written" propaganda, and "listening" education is more important than "reading" education. In other words, at present, because very few people can read newspapers, if newspapers want to speak to the masses, they must also change the written text published in the newspaper into language and say it to everyone through broadcasting. The "Decision of the News Administration on Establishing a Radio Broadcasting Network" stated: "Radio broadcasting is one of the most powerful tools for mass propaganda and education. In our country, where transportation is inconvenient, there are many illiterates, and there are insufficient newspapers, its role is even more significant." In fact, at present, we must not only use broadcasting to supplement the shortcomings of newspapers, but also use broadcasting to play the role of newspapers. We must combine newspapers and broadcasting: the news programs of radio stations should make full use of the records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency; the records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency should be as convenient as possible for radio stations to use, not only easy to read, but also easy to say and easy to listen to. In other words, the records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency should preferably be such that each article, each item, can be immediately spoken in front of the microphone by the broadcasters as is, so that the people of the whole country can hear the news and know this important thing in the shortest time. If there are still ambiguous places in the meaning of the text in the records of the People's Daily and the dispatches of Xinhua News Agency, even literate people - people with higher cultural levels - will not easily understand it after reading it, how can it be said to everyone through broadcasting? Of course, this can be broadcast after being pondered, deliberated, revised, and translated by radio staff, but after this pondering, deliberation, revision, and translation, I am afraid that it will be difficult to guarantee that there will be no discrepancies in the content. From a positive perspective, our writing must be reformed, and the method of reform is to use new phonetic writing. At present, all language educators must consider what difficulties and obstacles there are in changing to new writing, "prepare for a rainy day," and from now on, think of ways to reduce these difficulties, remove these obstacles, and pave a smooth road for the new writing. News workers are the most important language educators, and the writing they write is the most widely read and influential language textbook. Therefore, I sincerely hope that news workers will take the lead in this regard, hoping that when they write manuscripts, they will not only negatively ensure that there is no ambiguity in meaning, so that readers can easily see and read; but also pay attention at all times in a positive way: how to write so that it is easy to say and easy to hear. Anything that is easy to understand after reading and reading, but may have problems when speaking and listening, should be reduced as much as possible. Anything that can be understood by writing, but is not easy to understand by sound alone, without looking at the writing, should be changed as much as possible, change to writing that means the same and can be understood when pronounced, change to writing that means the same but only changes the word and sentence organization and can be understood when pronounced. By doing so, the writing they write, when published in the newspaper, will be the best textbook for literate people who can read the newspaper every day; when it comes to the mouths of broadcasters, it will be the best textbook for speaking to hundreds of millions of illiterates. By doing so, the writing they write can slowly have the conditions to be the predecessor of the new writing; with their work, with the influence of their work, they can slowly guide the broad masses of people towards the road of changing to new writing.

　　新闻写作要顾到读和听的便利
    朱文叔
    《新闻工作》第一期里重刊了一篇指示性的文字：“纠正新闻文字中几种技术上的通病”。这是新华通讯社总社在一九四八年十二月九日发给各总分社、各分社并转各报社的全体编辑记者同志们的一份电报。这份电报的大意说，“各地来稿中经常采用许多方言、专门术语、简称……等等；又往往习用许多含义不明或用错了的用语；造句文法多不完全，有的缺了主词，有的缺了宾词，有的用错了动词或形容词：这些毛病都大大增加了文字意义不明了的程度。今后必须改正这种语言文字上的混乱现象。我们一切发表的文字必须以最大多数的读者能够完全明了为原则。”“新闻工作”编者在按语里说：“这个电报里所指摘的新闻稿件中文字技术上的毛病，在一年以来还不断地在报章上出现。……这是一个关系千百万人的文风问题。我们希望新闻界的同志们首先注意这个问题，纠正这种文字技术上的毛病。”
    报纸是向群众讲话的，是给人民看的。要是报纸里有文字意义不明了的地方，最大多数的读者看不懂，或者看了之后会发生疑惑、误解，那就会减弱报纸的宣传、教育作用。
    人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯是各地方报纸都要利用的。胡乔木先生在全国新闻工作会议上的报告里说：“新华社的稿件需要在政治的、文字的水平上更加提高，使全国各地的报纸利用时更加便利。”要是人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯有文字意义不明了的地方，地方报纸工作人员在利用它的时候，把它“摘要或加以通俗解释”的时候，一定会发生许多疑难。尤其在偏远地方，有了疑难，写信问，来不及；查书，参考书又不多；只有疑惑一阵，猜度一阵，或者把它删去，或者依稀仿佛解释一下。结果，怕不免以误传误，减少宣传、教育的效率。
    人民日报又鼓励读者组织读报小组。读报小组的任务是“向群众宣传报纸的内容”。要是报纸里有文字意义不明了的地方，读报小组的积极分子向群众宣传报纸内容的时候，也一定会发生许多困难。一九四五年十月玉华先生写的“东河庄（属临沂县）的读报小组（读的报是大众日报跟鲁中日报）”里说：“因为他们读的时候，大半好读世界大事，人名地名都那么长，又难懂，又难记，大家都听不进去；再加上报上词句不通俗，他们也不讲，不接气不接句的念下去，大家更不感兴趣，没有读完人就跑净了。听的不愿意听，读的还觉得是一种额外的负担，这样，读报小组就慢慢的垮了台。”读了这一段文字，可以知道农村里的读报小组碰到了新闻通讯里的一些文字障碍，读报人是怎么样的困难，听众是怎么样的不容易懂，不感兴趣。现在，读报小组的积极分子还不能全都有很好的语文素养，报纸里文字意义不明了的地方越多，他们的困难就越大，读报小组的作用也就越小。
    在目前，我国文盲还非常多，“说”的宣传比“写”的宣传更重要，“听”的教育比“读”的教育更重要。换一句话说，在目前，因为能读报的人还非常少，报纸要向群众讲话，还得把登在报上的写成的文字，改用语言，通过广播，说给大家听。“新闻总署关于建立广播收音网的决定”里说：“无线电广播事业是群众性宣传、教育的最有力的工具之一。在我国目前交通不便、文盲众多、报纸不足的条件下，作用更为重大。”其实，在目前，我们不但要利用广播来补报纸的不足，还得利用广播来发挥报纸的作用。我们要使报纸跟广播结合起来：广播电台的新闻节目，要尽量利用人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯；人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯，要尽量做到便于广播电台利用，不但做到容易阅读，而且要做到容易说，容易听。换一句话说，人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯，最好是每一篇，每一则，让广播人员一拿上手，立刻就能照原样在播音机前说，在最短的时间之内让全国人民都听到这个消息，知道这件重要的事情。要是人民日报的记载跟新华社的通讯还有文字意义不明了的地方，识字的人——文化水平比较高的人看了读了都还不容易懂，怎么能通过广播说给大家听？固然，这可以经过电台人员揣摩、斟酌、修改、翻译，再广播出去，可是经过了这一番揣摩、斟酌、修改、翻译，内容方面怕就难保没有出入了。再从积极方面说，咱们的文字得改革，改革的办法是用拼音的新文字。在目前，所有语文教育工作者都得考虑改用新文字有些什么困难，有些什么障碍，“未雨绸缪”，从目前起，就想法减少这些困难，除去这些障碍，给新文字铺下一条平坦的道路。新闻工作者就是最重要的语文教育工作者，他们写的文字就是读者最多、影响最大的语文教材。所以，我诚恳的希望新闻工作者在这一方面起带头作用，希望他们写稿的时候，不但在消极方面做到一点儿没有意义不明了的地方，让读者容易看，容易读；而且在积极方面时时刻刻注意：怎么样写才容易说，容易听。凡是看了读了容易懂，说起来听起来可就有问题的地方，尽量减少。凡是凭文字可以了解，单凭声音、不看文字就不容易明了的地方，尽量改文字，改用意思相同一发音就听得懂的文字，改用意思相同只变动了词句组织一发音就听得懂的文字。这样做，他们写的文字，上了报，就是识字会读报的人每天最好的教材；上了广播员的口，就是最好的对亿万文盲讲话的教材。这样做，他们写的文字慢慢的可以具备做新文字前身的条件；凭他们的工作，凭他们的工作的影响，可以慢慢的引导广大人民走向改用新文字的路。
  一九五零年五月十九日
