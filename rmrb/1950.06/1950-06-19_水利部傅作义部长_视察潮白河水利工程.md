　　Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi
    Inspects Chaobai River Water Conservancy Project
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, along with Hao Zhiqi, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry, and others, departed from Beijing on the morning of the 4th of this month to inspect the Chaobai River water conservancy project east of Beijing, and returned to Beijing on the evening of the 10th after completing their work. In addition to inspecting the seven major projects of the Chaobai River improvement plan scheduled for construction this year, Minister Fu also inspected the ship repair factory of the Tianjin Haihe Engineering Office and the dredging projects of the Xinkai River and Jinzhong River. During the inspection, Minister Fu not only listened to reports on the construction progress and extended his regards to the military personnel, civilian workers, and staff participating in the river repair, but also gave instructions on issues such as project budgets and the distribution of wages and food, and extensively solicited opinions.

    The Chaobai River system improvement is one of the five major water conservancy projects in Hebei Province this year. The Chaobai River originates from the Yanshan Mountains in Rehe and Chahar provinces, with a high and rapid source. During the summer and autumn, when mountain floods erupt, the flow often exceeds 3,000 cubic meters per second. The maximum flow in 1949 reached more than 5,800 cubic meters per second. Its downstream is diverted into the Bei Canal (at Tong County) and the Ji Canal (at Laogaozhai, north of Baodi County). Because the flood discharge capacity of the Bei and Ji Canals is small, and the maximum discharge capacity of the Ji Canal within Baodi County and north of Ninghe County is only 200 cubic meters per second, the Chaobai River has caused the Ji and other rivers to breach their dikes and flood for years. In 1949, more than 1,900 villages in eight counties including Baodi, Xianghe, and Yutian were flooded, affecting over one million people.

    In order to reduce the threat of floods from the Chaobai River, the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, under the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, conducted surveys, measurements, and designs in the winter of 1949, and formulated a plan for improving the lower reaches of the Chaobai River with the goal of discharging a flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second (to completely eliminate the threat of floods, it is still necessary to build reservoirs for flood storage in the upper reaches), which was approved for implementation by the Government Administration Council. The seven projects being built this year are only the first phase of this downstream improvement plan, and the entire plan will be completed next year. The first phase of seven projects began successively in early April this year, with the participation of more than 93,000 civilian and military workers. All projects are now nearing completion and are expected to be completed before the arrival of the major flood season. In this way, although the flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second cannot be completely resolved this year, the threat of floods in the eastern Beijing area can be greatly reduced.

    The main content of the Chaobai River downstream improvement plan is to excavate new river channels so that 1,600 cubic meters per second of the 3,000 cubic meters per second flow can enter the sea from Beitangkou east of Xianghe and south of Baodi. In addition, this year's projects also include the construction of protection works in Suzhuang, Shunyi County, upstream of the Chaobai River, with the aim of preventing riverbank collapse and river course changes; reinforcing the dikes of the Jian'gan River (which has become the main stream of the Chaobai River) so that it can discharge a flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second; constructing the Niumutun (north of Xianghe County, on the banks of the Jian'gan River) diversion canal entrance, so that 700 cubic meters per second of the Chaobai River water can be diverted into the Bei Canal; and restoring the Tumenlou (southwest of Xianghe County) sluice gate on the Bei Canal, so that the Bei Canal can divert water here.

### 水利部傅作义部长  视察潮白河水利工程

　　水利部傅作义部长
    视察潮白河水利工程
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义，偕同该部办公厅副主任郝执齐等一行，于本月四日晨自京出发，视察北京以东地区的潮白河水利工程，已事毕于十日晚返京。傅部长此次除视察整理潮白河计划中今年施工的七大工程以外，并曾视察天津海河工程处的船舶修理厂和新开河、金钟河的挖河工程。傅部长在视察过程中，每到一处除听取施工情况的报告，和慰问参加修河的军工、民工及工作人员外，曾就工程预算和发工资粮食等问题有所指示，并广泛地征求了意见。
    潮白河水系的整理是河北省今年五大水利工程之一。潮白河导源于热河、察哈尔两省的燕山山地，源高水急，夏秋山洪暴发时，流量常超过三千秒立方公尺以上，一九四九年的最高流量曾达五千八百多秒立方公尺；其下游分泄入北运河（在通县处）和蓟运河（在宝坻县北的老高寨）。由于北运、蓟运两河排洪量小，蓟运河在宝坻县境内和在宁河县城以北的一段河道，最高泄水量只有二百秒立方公尺，致潮白河连年引起蓟运等河的溃堤泛滥。一九四九年，宝坻、香河、玉田等八县就淹了一千九百多个村庄，受灾人口达一百余万。
    为减除潮白河水患威胁，中央人民政府水利部所属华北水利工程局，经一九四九年冬的查勘、测量和设计，制定了一个以宣泄三千秒立方公尺流量为目标的潮白河下游整理工程计划（如求彻底根除水患，尚须在上游建库蓄洪），经政务院批准实施。今年进行修建的七项工程，仅为这个下游整理计划的第一期工程，全部计划的工程明年才能完成。第一期七项工程于今年四月初相继开工，参加的民工和军工共九万三千余人。现全部工程都已接近完成，大汛到来以前预计可全部完工。这样，在今年虽还不能完全解决三千秒立方公尺的流量，但可大大减轻京东地区所受水患的威胁。
    潮白河下游整理计划的主要内容，是开挖新的河道，使三千秒立方公尺中的一千六百秒立方公尺的流量自香河以东经宝坻以南由北塘口入海。此外，今年的工程中还有在潮白河上游顺义县苏庄修筑防护工程，目的在防止河岸坍塌与改道；培修箭杆河（已成潮白河正流）堤防，使能宣泄三千秒立方公尺的流量；修筑牛牧屯（香河县北，在箭杆河岸）引河口，使潮白河水由此分泄七百秒立方入北运河；修复北运河上土门楼（香河县西南）泄水闸，使北运河在此分流。
