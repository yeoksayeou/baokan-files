　　Suburban Beijing Rural Areas After Land Reform
    Farmers in the Fourteenth District Strive to Increase Production by 10%
    Zhao Youfu
    Having undergone the land reform movement, farmers in the suburbs of the capital are working hard on the land they have been allocated to achieve this year's goal of increasing production by 10%. Liu Chaoge, the director of the Huai Fang Village Farmers' Association, said: "The characteristics of this year's production are: more people working, more fertilizer applied, more sweet potatoes and cotton planted, more irrigated land opened up, and an eager desire to harvest more grain in the autumn." This is absolutely correct. During my inspection of spring plowing in the countryside, every time I passed a field, someone would greet me: "Comrade, how does my crop look?" I said, "Not bad." They would smile happily and then say: "This year, this piece of land has plenty of fertilizer and no weeds, so a good harvest is guaranteed!"

    Mutual Aid Through Work Exchange
    The Fourteenth District is very short of animal power. The entire district has more than 5,300 head of livestock (including more than 300 used for transportation). Each head of livestock is used to cultivate an average of more than 55 mu of land. To solve the difficulty of labor and draft animals, farmers have organized mutual aid through work exchange. The work exchange group of Huo Fengqi and 17 other households in Lucun Village was established in March last year and has persisted until now. This group received two animals during the land reform and used government loans to buy two more, which are fed by Huo Fengqi. He feeds them well and uses them appropriately, so the animals are very fat. To facilitate production, the whole group is divided into three subgroups, which meet every evening to plan the next day's work. They have conducted work evaluation, work recording, and work clearing. The difficulties of labor, animal power, and farm implements for the 17 households in this group have been resolved. Most of the farmers in the village have also been organized and have proposed the slogan "Learn from Huo Fengqi." Meng Xiuhua, Tong Xigeng, and Yan Baosen from Xin'gong Village formed a mutual aid group. Yan Baosen is a bachelor, and Meng Xiuhua and Tong Xigeng are both orphans and widows. The crops of the three households are planted very well with mutual aid through work exchange. Most of the farmers in the district have organized shared plowing and work exchange groups based on existing habits, using methods such as exchanging labor for animal power, exchanging feed for animal power, and making price adjustments now and repaying in the fall, which has solved the difficulty of labor and animal power shortage. Although some groups still have shortcomings such as not recording work or not equalizing value, generally speaking, mutual aid through work exchange has played a significant role in production. Yu Dequan's group in Huaifang hoed 16 mu of seedlings in one day. He said, "Work exchange is really efficient. One person would have to hoe 10 days to do 16 mu!"

    Women Go to the Fields
    "Now that we have land, we have to work harder to cultivate it well. There are really many more women going to the fields this year." This is what Grandma Jiang, who is over 60 years old from Xin'gong Village, told me while hoeing seedlings. After the land reform, most of the women in rural areas have become active participants in production. Each village has put forward slogans such as "Labor is the most glorious" and "For increased production, men and women should work together." According to statistics from 18 villages, including Huaifang, Xiwuhao, Shibalidian, and Jiugong, there are more than 4,700 women participating in agricultural production. Tao Xushi from Huaifang Village cultivates eight mu of land by herself, doing the plowing, planting, hoeing, and fertilizer delivery herself or through work exchange. A saying is circulating among the women in each village: "If you want to eat a satisfying meal, do it yourself!"

    Lazy People Become Diligent
    In the vigorous production movement in various villages, most of the landlords, vagrants, lazy people, and monks have also participated in labor. Sixteen vagrants in Huaifang Village used to be involved in swindling, cheating, abducting, collapsing, stealing, eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and smoking because they had no land and no jobs. After the land reform, 15 of them participated in labor. Gao Yulu, a vagrant who turned over a new leaf, said: "Before, I didn't even have a scrap of land, and I had no choice but to steal; now that I have land, I have to cultivate it well." Zhang Puli, who had been a monk for more than 20 years and relied on chanting scriptures for a living, is now also working in the fields. All 21 landlords in the village have participated in labor. The landlord Zhang Qin used to be an idler who wouldn't even help if an oil bottle fell, but now he is watering gardens, weeding, and selling vegetables. Twenty-four landlords in Laojuntang have started to participate in production. Four monks cultivated 12 mu of land and opened up 2 mu of wasteland. Two monks in Huangtukeng are also cultivating land and collecting manure. The farmers all say: The land reform is doing a good job, turning idlers into laborers.

    Apply More Fertilizer
    Farmers in Xinkailu, Jixian, Huaifang, and other villages have all reported: There are too many people picking up manure this year. Farmers in Chengshousi, Shibalidian, Paifang, and other areas have all reported: This year, more black soil has been hauled than in any other year. Farmers are indeed putting extra effort into fertilizing this year. Laojuntang Village hauled more than 5,000 cartloads of black soil, more than four times the amount last year. Shibalidian hauled more than 6,600 cartloads of black soil this year, increasing the fertilization of each mu of land by half a cartload. There are still many carts in the village, making two trips a day. Longzhuashu Village applied 219,400 jin of fertilizer (converted to manure) throughout last year. This year, as of now, it has applied 416,000 jin of fertilizer (converted to manure), and many farmers are also preparing to seize green manure. Xiaohongmen bought 84 more cartloads of dried manure than last year. Yinghaizhuang, which used to apply one cartload of manure to three mu of land, has increased it to one cartload of manure to two mu of land this year. Farmers all know that increasing fertilizer application is the main guarantee for increasing production.

    Strive to Increase Production by 10%
    Many farmers have converted their allocated dry land into irrigated land or raised-bed land. Bao Jinming, a farmer from Huaifang Village, turned the five mu of alkaline depression land he was allocated into irrigated land as soon as the spring thaw came, planting three mu of spring wheat and one mu of potatoes. Yu Jinglin, a middle peasant, hired people to work together to turn a piece of depression land that he originally didn't use into 13 mu of raised-bed land. He said: "Before, the land wasn't our own, so we didn't dare to put down a base layer, but now we have to take good care of it." Huaifang Village dug 10 brick wells and repaired two brick wells this year, increasing irrigated land by more than 130 mu. Shibalidian dug four wells, repaired four wells, and borrowed wells to open up 113.5 mu of irrigated land.

    To increase production, each village is planting more cotton, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and vegetables than in previous years. For example, Zhang Maoquan, a poor farmer from Huaifang Village, planted four mu of wheat, 2.5 mu of sweet potatoes, and 1.5 mu of cotton on his eight mu of land; he still plans to plant some sweet potatoes on the wheat stubble. Zhang Jingtian, a poor farmer, planted five mu of wheat, one mu of spring wheat, one mu of barley, 2.5 mu of cotton, one mu of sweet potatoes, and half a mu of vegetables on his 11 mu of land.

    The autumn crops have mostly sprouted, and preparations are being made to seize green manure and complete the second weeding before the wheat harvest. The farmers all said, "Weeding four times this year won't be a problem." Chen Yanlong, a farmer from Xin'gong, said: "This year, we have to plan everything carefully to increase production."

　　土地改革后的京郊农村
    十四区农民努力增产一成
    赵有福
    经过土地改革运动的首都郊区农民，正在自己分得的土地上为达到今年增产一成的目标而努力着。槐房村农会主任刘朝阁说：“今年生产的特点是：干活的人多，上的粪多，种的白薯、棉花多，开的水浇地多，争取秋后多打粮食的心热。”这话一点也不错。这次我到农村检查春耕工作时，走过每块地头，总有人招呼：“同志，看看我这庄稼怎么样？”我说：“不错”。他们便高兴地笑起来，接着说：“今年这块地，粪大，又没草，保险好收成！”
    拨工互助
    十四区畜力很缺。全区共有牲畜五千三百多头（内有跑运输的三百多头）。每头平均耕种土地五十五亩以上。为了解决劳力和耕畜的困难，农民组织了拨工互助。鹿圈村霍凤起等十七户的拨工组，从去年三月成立，一直坚持到现在。这个组在土地改革中分得两头牲口，又用政府贷款买了两头牲口，由霍凤起负责喂着；喂的好，使用的也得当，牲口都很肥。为了便利生产，全组分成三个小组，每晚碰头计划第二天的工作。他们进行了评工、记工、清工。该组十七户耕种土地的劳力、畜力、农具等困难都解决了。全村大部农民也已组织起来，并提出向霍凤起看齐的口号。新宫村孟秀花、桐喜庚、阎宝森三户成立了互助组。阎宝森是光棍一人，孟秀花、桐喜庚都是孤、寡。三户的庄稼，在拨工互助下种的很好。全区大部农民，在旧有习惯的基础上，组织了合犋，拨工组，运用了人力换畜力、草料换畜力、现在作价秋后偿还等方法，解决了劳力和畜力缺乏的困难。虽然有的组还存在着不记工、不等价的缺点，但总的说来，拨工互助在生产中起了很大作用。槐房于德全组六个人一天锄了十六亩苗子，他说：“拨工干活真出活，十六亩地一个人可得锄十天！”
    妇女下地
    “咱们有了土地，就得多多卖力气把地种好。今年妇女下地的可真多了。”这是新宫村六十多岁的姜老太太锄苗时告诉我的。土地改革后的农村，妇女们大部成为生产中的积极分子。各村提出了“劳动最光荣”，“为了增产，男女下手干”等口号。据槐房、西五号、十八里店、旧宫等十八个村统计，共有四千七百多名妇女参加了农业生产。槐房村陶许氏自己种八亩地，耕、种、锄、送粪等都是自己干或拨工干。各村妇女流传着这样一句话：“要吃趁心饭，自己下手干！”
    懒人变勤
    在各村蓬勃的生产运动中、地主、二流子、懒汉、和尚大部也参加了劳动。槐房村十六个二流子，过去因为没有土地，没有职业，大部是坑、骗、拐、崩、偷、吃、喝、嫖、赌、抽的。土地改革后，有十五个参加了劳动。改邪归正的二流子高玉禄说：“以前我连个地渣儿也没有，不偷没办法；现在有了土地可得好好种。”张仆立当了二十多年和尚，靠念经吃饭，现在也下地劳动了。全村有二十一个地主参加了劳动。地主张勤过去是油瓶倒了也不扶的闲人，现在也浇园、锄草、卖菜了。老君堂有二十四个地主开始参加了生产。四个和尚种了十二亩地，并开了二亩荒地。黄土坑也有两个和尚种地拾粪了。农民都说：土地改革作的好，把闲人都变成了劳动人。
    多多施肥
    新开路、集贤、槐房等村农民都反映：今年捡粪的太多了，成寿寺、十八里店、牌坊等一带农民都反映：今年拉的黑土比那一年都多；今年农民在施肥上确是特别加劲。老君堂一个村子拉了五千多车黑土，超过去年四倍。十八里店今年拉黑土六千六百多车，作到每亩地增肥半车。现在该村仍有很多车，一天拉两趟。龙爪树村去年全年施肥二十一万九千四百斤（折大粪），今年截至现在已施肥四十一万六千斤（折大粪），有不少农民还准备抓青。小红门比去年多买大粪干八十四车。瀛海庄常年三亩地一车粪，今年增加到二亩地一车粪。农民们都知道：增施肥料，是增产的主要保证。
    努力增产一成
    很多农民已把自己分到的旱地改成了水浇地或筒子地。槐房村农民包金明，在春天刚化冻时，便把分到的五亩碱洼地，垫成了水浇地，种了三亩春麦、一亩土豆。佃中农于景林，把自己原用不动的一块洼地，雇人合力开成了十三亩筒子地。他说：“以前地不是咱自己的，不敢下垫地，现在可得好好收拾它。”槐房村今年打了十眼砖井，修理了两眼砖井，增加水浇地一百三十多亩。十八里店打井四眼，修井四眼，及借井开水地一百一十三亩半。
    为了增加产量，各村今年种的棉花、白薯、花生、蔬菜比往年都多。如槐房村贫农张茂全，在自己的八亩地中种了四亩小麦，二亩半白薯，一亩半棉花；麦茬地仍准备种些白薯。贫农张井田在十一亩地中种了五亩小麦，一亩春麦，一亩大麦，二亩半棉花，一亩白薯和半亩蔬菜。
    秋庄稼已大部开苗，准备在麦秋前抓青、锄完二遍。农民都说：“今年锄四遍不成问题。”新宫农民陈彦龙说：“今年种地，处处可得盘算着增产。”
