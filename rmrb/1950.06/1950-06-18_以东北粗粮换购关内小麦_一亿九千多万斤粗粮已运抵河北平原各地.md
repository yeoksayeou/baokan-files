Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government decided to exchange coarse grains from the Northeast for agricultural products from disaster areas in Inner China. The North China region has already transported most of the 195.5 million jin of coarse grains allocated to Hebei and Pingyuan provinces to various locations and has begun to lend them to farmers through cooperatives. The grain companies of the two provinces have signed contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives of their respective provinces for the exchange of coarse grains for wheat and cotton, with detailed provisions for the specific methods of exchange quantities. After the summer harvest and autumn harvest, these lent grains will be recovered according to the prescribed ratio of wheat, cotton, and other rural sideline products. This will not only help farmers in disaster areas overcome the difficulties of the lean season but also solve the problem of farmers selling wheat, cotton, and other agricultural products after the harvest.

　　以东北粗粮换购关内小麦
    一亿九千多万斤粗粮已运抵河北平原各地
    【新华社天津十七日电】中央人民政府政务院财经委员会决定以东北粗粮换购关内灾区农产品后，华北区已将分配给河北、平原两省的一亿九千五百万斤粗粮大部运抵各地，开始通过合作社贷给农民。两省粮食公司已与各该省供销合作总社签订粗粮换购麦、棉的合同，对换购数量的具体办法，都有详细规定。这批贷粮到夏收及秋收以后，将按规定比率，收回小麦、棉花及其它农村副业产品。这样不但能帮助灾区农民度过青黄不接的困难，且可解决农民小麦、棉花等农产品收获后的销售问题。
