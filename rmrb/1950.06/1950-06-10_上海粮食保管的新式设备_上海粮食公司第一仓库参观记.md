Shanghai's New Equipment for Grain Storage
    A Visit to the Shanghai Grain Company's First Warehouse
    Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin

　　During Shanghai's massive grain transfer this year, the generally high moisture content of the grain has added many difficulties to the storage work, leading to instances of grain heating and molding in March and April. At that time, the only solution was to turn and spread the piles. However, this could only provide a temporary solution to prevent the grain from molding, and could not fundamentally solve the problem. In order to improve grain storage, the Shanghai Grain Company began considering establishing new grain storage equipment in its First Warehouse from November of last year, to strengthen grain storage from a scientific and technological perspective.

    The new equipment in the First Warehouse can be divided into three parts: 1. Moisture testing laboratory, 2. Processing plant, 3. Dryer (also known as a drying tower). According to the needs of grain storage, grain with a moisture content of more than 15% generally needs to be dried. Drying it to a moisture content of 13% or less allows for long-term safe storage, preventing phenomena such as heating and molding. Therefore, the first step in grain storage is moisture testing.

    1. How to Extract Water from Rice?

    The testing process involves placing 100 grams of rice taken from the grain warehouse into a steel retort, adding 200cc of high-boiling-point (215 degrees Celsius) red machine oil, mixing it with the rice, sealing the mouth of the bottle, and then placing it on an electric stove to heat, until it reaches 180 degrees Celsius and then returns to 160 degrees. Because high-boiling-point oil must reach 215 degrees Celsius to turn into gas, it will not turn into gas below 200 degrees, while the boiling point of water is 100 degrees. When heated to a maximum of 180 degrees, the moisture contained in the rice (including physiological moisture) will all turn into gas and be evaporated. This gas is guided through a glass tube into a cold water tank, where it is cooled and condensed into water, flowing into a measuring cup. The amount of cc's of water obtained is the percentage of moisture content. For example, if 100 grams of rice evaporates 15cc of water (each cc of water weighs 1 gram), then the moisture content is 15%. The results of this test can be used to determine storage and treatment methods based on the moisture content. If the moisture content is determined to be above 15%, it should be immediately sent to the dryer for drying in order to ensure safe storage. If it is below 15%, the risk is lower, and temporary measures such as spreading and turning piles can be used. If the moisture content is below 13%, it is the most ideal moisture level, and safe storage should not be a problem. If the rice quality is found to be too poor, not meeting the standards, or if there is too much bran powder in the rice, it is also prone to heating, molding, or insect infestation, and must be processed in the processing plant before it can be safely stored.

    2. The Processing Plant, Constantly Improving

    The processing plant has twelve Japanese-style rice milling machines produced by the China Diesel Engine Company, divided into two groups of six, with automatic rice feeding and discharge, powder addition, air blowing, and bran discharge equipment. The main part of the rice milling machine consists of a screw core and a movable sleeve, using rotation to push the rice forward and grind it white through friction. This differs from the Chinese-style rice milling machine, which uses a knife edge to scrape it white, and consumes less energy than the Chinese-style machine.

    The construction project began on October 20, 1949, and the official trial run was on December 1st, but it was unusable. The Grain Company and the China Diesel Engine Company jointly studied and revised it, and it was not completed until December 20th. Milling began day and night on the same day. The milling speed for white indica rice increased from over 40 large bags (200 jin per bag) per hour to 76 large bags, and milling white japonica rice could also reach 60 large bags per hour. The production efficiency is: twelve rice milling machines can produce 90 *shi* of white indica rice and 100 *shi* of brown rice per hour. On average, each rice milling machine can produce 7.5 *shi* of white indica rice and 8.3 *shi* of brown rice per hour. The processing cost is 4,400 yuan per *shi* of white indica rice, and the electricity consumption is an average of 0.52 kWh per *shi* of brown rice milled white (ordinary Chinese rice milling machines consume more than 0.6 kWh), and the milling loss is also reduced by 1% compared to ordinary Chinese rice milling machines. The rice discharge from the machine is fast, more than twice as fast as ordinary Chinese rice milling machines. However, its disadvantages are high bran powder consumption, uneven automatic powder addition, and inability to remove the rice husk. Therefore, rice with a higher content of paddy grains still contains paddy grains after milling white. The construction of these twelve rice milling machines cost over 400 million yuan in total, but from the start of operation on December 20th of last year to the end of March this year, after deducting all expenses, there was still a net profit of 480 million yuan, completely recouping the cost of the rice milling machines.

    3. The Dryer, Exploring and Creating

    The construction of the dryer began in November of last year with the laying of the foundation, and officially started in December, largely completed by the end of February this year. When the official trial run on March 1st revealed it to be unusable, it was repeatedly inspected, modified, and improved until it officially started work on March 24th. Working around the clock, 24 hours a day, it can dry 500 to 1,500 *shi* of water-soaked rice (reducing the moisture content from 17% to 13%).

    The construction of this dryer also went through a struggle. Initially, there were no blueprints, and the current achievements were only made through continuous efforts and improvements through exploration. The initial design intended to use electric heating or steam heating, but it was deemed uneconomical under the current conditions, so it was decided to adopt the American HESS method, burning coal and directly guiding the hot air into the tower with a blower to dry the wet rice. The dried rice would then continuously enter the bottom of the drying tower, where another blower would send in cold air to cool it before being sent out for packaging. Due to continuous research and modification, the current drying tower, although not completely ideal, has been greatly improved compared to the original machine. The most significant improvements are: 1. The initial hot air volume was insufficient. After continuous improvements, the current air volume can reach 7,200 cubic feet per minute, which is large enough. However, if even more rice needs to be dried, the quantity is still insufficient. The newly built dryer uses two blowers, with a hot air volume of 14,400 cubic feet. The original hot air layer had 21 layers, now increased to 33 layers, and the two hot air streams are also separated. The purpose is to first lower the hot air temperature, starting at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and then increasing it to 180 degrees, gradually increasing the temperature so that the rice does not crack due to sudden exposure to high temperatures, maintaining its original color. The quantity of rice dried can also be increased to 2,000 *shi*. 2. The original machine setup required 110 bags to be dried at a time. Now, after modification, switches have been added between the hot air layer and the cold air layer, which can be freely switched on and off, and there are also switching devices between each air layer. Therefore, it is now possible to dry rice regardless of the quantity. 3. Originally, the rice was discharged manually, making it difficult to accurately control the time. If a motor was used, the slowest speed was 450 revolutions per minute, while the fastest manual shaking speed was only 1.5 revolutions per minute, sometimes even one revolution in two minutes. On the other hand, the drying time required varies depending on the moisture content of the rice. Based on the above situation, a fast and slow gear device was adopted, determining the speed based on the time required for the rice's moisture content. This allows for automatic adjustment of the time.

    After the machine was renovated, from March 24th to May 4th, it worked day and night for 24 hours, drying over 40,000 bags of water-soaked rice with a moisture content of 15.5% to 25%. Workers were divided into three shifts, with nine people per shift (including one technician), each shift working eight hours, plus 43 workers from the outside shift transporting rice, with a daily input and output of 3,000 *shi*. The daily consumption is 0.8 tons of coal (2,000 jin per ton), and 350 kWh of electricity. In terms of drying loss, the highest is 9.5%, the lowest is 3%, and the average is 4% to 7%. The drying cost per *shi* of rice is 3,200 yuan, which is less than the cost of hiring people to spread it out. Moreover, after drying, the problem of grain storage is basically solved. Facts have proven that this method of drying is both scientific and labor-saving in grain storage. However, due to insufficient equipment, only 1,500 *shi* can be dried per day, far from enough to meet the needs. To this end, the Shanghai Grain Company has also rented five wheat roasting machines from the Shanghai Fufeng Flour Mill and converted them for drying rice, which can dry 5,000 *shi* of rice per day, reducing the moisture content to below 13.5%, with a cost of about 4,000 yuan per *shi*. Preparations are being made for further improvements, so that 6,000 *shi* can be dried per day. In addition, the second warehouse's brewery used to have a baking room, originally used to roast malt, which can roast 1,000 *shi* of rice per day. In this way, a total of 8,500 *shi* can be dried per day. By May 25th, two newly built American-style rice drying machines and one Japanese-style rice drying machine were completed one after another. The former two can dry 4,000 *shi* per day, and the latter can dry 1,000 *shi* per day. Therefore, after the 25th, about 13,500 *shi* of rice can be dried per day, and the Shanghai grain storage problem can be completely solved.

　　上海粮食保管的新式设备
    上海粮食公司第一仓库参观记
    本报特派记者  周子芹
    上海今年巨额粮食调运中，因一般粮食含水量较重，给保管工作增加了很多困难，以致三、四月份曾发生了粮食发热发霉的现象。当时唯一的办法就是翻桩、摊晾。但这只能对防止粮食发霉起到暂时的作用，而不能从根本上解决问题。为了做好粮食保管工作，上海粮食公司从去年十一月起，即开始考虑在第一仓库建立粮食保管的新式设备，从科学技术方面来加强粮食的保管。
    第一仓库的新式设备可分成三个部分：一、水分化验室，二、加工场，三、烘干机（亦名烘塔）。按照粮食保管的需要，一般是含水量在百分之十五以上的，即须采用烘干的办法。烘到含水量百分之十三以下，即可长期安全保管，不致发生发热霉烂等现象。因此，粮食保管的第一步工作，即为水分化验工作。
    一、如何从米里取出水来？
    化验工作的进行，是先把从粮食仓库取来的米一百克放入钢烧瓶里，再加上二○○ＣＣ的高沸点（摄氏二一五度）的红机油，将它和米搅匀，将瓶口密闭，然后放到电灶上去烧，一直烧到摄氏一八○度再回到一百六十度。因为高沸点油必须在摄氏二一五度才能变成气体，在二百度以下不会变成气体，而水的沸点是一百度，当被烧到最高一百八十度时，米里面含有的水分（包括生理水分）即全部化成气体，被蒸发出来了。这种气体经过一玻璃管导入冷水箱，又遇冷凝结成水分，流入到量杯里面，得出来多少ＣＣ的水，即为其所含水分的百分率。假如一百克米，蒸出来了十五ＣＣ（水每一ＣＣ重一克）的水，即含水量为百分之十五。这样化验的结果，即可根据水分多少，确定保管与处理的办法。如检定其含水量在百分之十五以上，即应立即送入烘干机烘干，才能作安全保管，如在百分之十五以下，危险性较小，即可暂用摊晾、翻桩等办法。假如含水量在百分之十三以下，即为最合标准的水分，安全保管可无问题。如发现米质太劣，不合标准，或米内糠粉太多，也容易发热霉烂或生虫，就须送到加工场加工后才可安全保管。
    二、在不断改进中的加工场
    加工场有中国柴油机公司出品的日本式米机十二部，共分两组，每组六部，附有自动进出米、加粉、吹风及出糠设备。米机碾米之主要部分由螺丝心与存移的套筒利用转动推米前进，并互相磨擦碾白，与中国式米机用刀口刮白不同，耗费较中国式为小。
    修建工程从一九四九年十月二十日开始动工，到十二月一日正式试车，但不能使用，粮食公司又和中国柴油机公司共同研究修改，直到十二月二十日才告完成。并于当日开始日夜开机碾米。碾米速度，白籼米由每小时的四十余大包（每包二百斤）增加到七十六大包，碾白粳米每小时也可达六十大包。生产效率是：十二部米机每小时可出九二白籼米九十石，出糙籼一百石。平均每部米机每小时可出白籼七·五石，糙籼八·三石。加工成本费每石白籼米合四千四百元，耗电量平均每石糙米碾白用电○·五二度（普通中国米机耗电○·六度以上），碾米损耗亦较普通中国米机减少百分之一。米机出口迅速，较普通中国米机大两倍以上。但其缺点是光粉消耗大，自动加粉不均匀，不能碾去谷壳。所以含稻粒较多之米，碾白后稻粒仍然存在。这十二部米机在修建中一共用去人民币四亿多元，但从去年十二月二十日开工后到今年三月底止，除了一切开支，尚净赚四亿八千万元，又把米机成本费用完全赚了回来。
    三、在摸索创造中的烘干机
    烘干机的建立，是从去年十一月就开始打好地基工程，到十二月正式动工，今年二月底才大体完成。三月一日正式试车时发觉不能使用，又经再三检修改进，至三月二十四日始正式开工。日夜二十四小时工作，可以烘水渍米五百石到一千五百石（将含水量由百分之十七烘到百分之十三）。
    这次烘干机的修建，也是经过了一翻斗争的。开始时连图样也没有，完全是从摸索中经过了不断的努力改进，才造成了现在的成绩。最初设计，拟用电热或蒸气热，因在目前条件下颇不经济，乃决定采用美国赫斯（ＨＥＳＳ）式，燃烧焦煤，直接引导热气由鼓风机送入塔内，将潮米烘干后，再使已烘干之米陆续进入烘塔底部，由另一鼓风机送入冷风，吹冷后即送出打包。由于经过了不断的研究和改造，现在的烘塔虽尚不能完全合乎理想，但较原来机器已有很大改进。最显著的地方有：一、开始热风量不够，经过不断改进之后，现在每分钟可送进空气七千二百立方英尺，已满够大了。但如果烘米更多，数量仍嫌不够。现在新盖的用两个鼓风机，热风量为一万四千四百立方英尺，本来热气层为二十一层，现在增加到三十三层，而且又将两个热风气中间隔绝起来。其作用是先将热风温度放低，开始为华氏一百二十度，然后加到一百八十度，这样使温度逐渐加高，使米不致因突然碰到高温发生裂纹，以保持原来成色。烘米的数量也可加多到二千石。二、原来机器装置，每次必须够一百一十包才能烘，现在经过改造，在热气层与冷气层之间，增设了开关，可以自由开关，而每个气层之间也有开关设备。因此，已能做到不管米的数量多少，都可以烘了。三、原来出米时，是用人力摇，故控制时间很不容易准确。如用马达牵动，每分钟最慢的是四百五十转，而人工摇米速度最快的每分钟不过一·五转，有时甚至两分钟才转一转。另一方面，因各种米的含水量不同，需要烘干的时间也不一样。根据以上情况，便采用了装置快慢齿轮的办法，根据米含水量需用时间，确定好快慢速度。这样就可以自动调节时间。
    机器装修完成后，从三月二十四日开始到五月四日，每天日夜开工二十四小时，已烘了含水量百分之十五·五到百分之二十五的水渍米四万多包。工作时将工人分成三班，每班九人（其中一个技术工人），每班工作八小时，外加运米的外班工人四十三人，每天进出米量为三千石。每天烧焦煤○·八吨（每吨二千斤），用电三百五十度，在烘干损耗方面，最高为百分之九·五，最低到百分之三，普通则为百分之四到百分之七。每石米烘干成本费三千二百元，比雇人摊晾所花的成本费为小。并且经过烘干以后，粮食保管上即基本上解决了问题。事实证明：这种采用烘干的办法，在粮食保管上是既科学而又省力的。但目前因设备不够，每天只能烘到一千五百石，远远不够需要。为此，上海粮食公司又租用了上海阜丰面粉厂的五部烤麦机改作烘米之用，每天可烘到五千石米，水分也烘到百分之十三·五以下，成本每石约四千元。准备再加以改进，每天可烘到六千石。此外，第二仓库的啤酒厂过去曾设有烤房，原用烤麦芽机，每天可烤米一千石。这样，一共可以每天烘到八千五百石。到五月二十五日，又有新盖的两个美式烘米机和一部日式烘米机先后完成，前两部每天可烘到四千石，后一部每天可烘到一千石。因此，二十五日以后，每天就可以烘米一万三千五百石左右，上海粮食的保管问题即可全部解决。
