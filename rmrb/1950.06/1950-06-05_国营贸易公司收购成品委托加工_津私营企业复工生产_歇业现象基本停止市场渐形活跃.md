　　State-owned Trading Companies Purchase Finished Products and Commission Processing
	Tianjin's Private Enterprises Resume Production
	Shutdowns Basically Cease and the Market Gradually Becomes Active
	[This newspaper reports] In order to help private industry in Tianjin overcome the difficulties of sluggish sales of finished products and production shrinkage since price stabilization, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee has vigorously organized various state-owned trading companies since late March to purchase finished products from various factories and commission processing, supporting production. Significant results have now been achieved. As of mid-May, the situation of shutdowns, closures, or bankruptcies in Tianjin's major industrial sectors has basically stopped, and is turning towards resumption of production. General prices in early May fell by 2.88% compared to late April; and the rate of decline was also significantly smaller than in early April, while department stores and grocery categories even rose by 2.82%, and market transactions are now gradually becoming active.
	Regarding the purchase of finished products and support for production by various state-owned trading companies: From April 1st to May 10th, in 40 days, the North China Department Store Company purchased products from public and private factories worth over 34.1 billion yuan, accounting for over 50% of the company's total purchases of 64.8 billion yuan during the same period, of which products from public factories accounted for approximately 20%, and products from private factories accounted for approximately 80%. Transactions occurred with a total of over 200 factories. Among the major industries in private enterprises, the proportion of finished product purchases was highest for Yongli Company (soda ash), accounting for 30%, followed by Yaohua Glass Factory accounting for 14.2%, the rubber industry accounting for 13%, the cigarette industry accounting for 12.5%, the paper industry accounting for 9%, the electrical materials, stationery, and toothbrush industries accounting for 7.5%, the weaving and dyeing industry accounting for 7%, the chemical dye industry accounting for 1.4%, the match industry accounting for 1.1%, and other industries accounting for 4.3%.
	This purchase work has played a significant role in the capital turnover and restoration of production in various industries. First, it enabled many factories to complete the payment of public bonds and industrial and commercial taxes, and solved the difficulties of capital turnover caused by sluggish sales of finished products, allowing them to continue production. For example, large-scale purchases of soda ash from Yongli Company, socks from Daxing and Yisheng factories, towels from Lihe, Xingtai, and Shengsheng factories, soap from Limin, Jihua, and Fuxing factories, toothbrushes from Tongchang and Yongchang factories, and inner and outer tires from Dahua and Yongfeng factories, solved the capital turnover difficulties of each of these factories. Furthermore, Xincheng, Dasheng, Guanghua, Tianjin and other paper mills had all stopped production due to sluggish sales of finished products, but resumed production after purchasing over 4,000 reams of paper. Ruixingyuanji Knitting Factory stopped production for several days, but resumed after purchasing over 5,000 dozen undershirts. Yongcheng Underwear Factory and Tongsheng Factory were in a state of semi-shutdown due to accumulated finished products, but were able to continue operations after purchasing 3,600 dozen shirts and 250 bolts of cloth. In addition, the purchase of 1,000 boxes of finished products from Wanli, Jinhua, Yong'an and other match factories, and over 1,100 boxes of finished products from the tobacco industry, solved many difficulties for these factories.
	Secondly, the processing and ordering by state-owned enterprises solved the difficulties of many factories lacking raw materials. Changxingcheng and Taihe Dyeing Factories, among others, were close to shutting down, but were able to resume operation after dyeing 3,500 bolts of cloth for the Department Store Company. For example, Wenhua Stationery Factory began production immediately after receiving an order.
	Due to the purchases by state-owned companies, the prices of industrial products have become more reasonable. For example, rubber shoes have gradually increased from an average price of 290,000 yuan per dozen to 340,000 yuan. After the purchase of vulcanized blue, it has gradually risen to 600,000 to 800,000 yuan. As of now, the phenomenon of high cost and low market price of major industrial products has changed. Except for paper, sales at current prices can generally ensure that there are no more losses.
	At the same time, the purchase work has also played a guiding role in Tianjin's industrial production. Many factories have improved their production after the Department Store Company provided guidance on the specifications and quality of their finished products. For example, Xintai and Shengsheng Towel Factories have changed from producing fancy striped towels to plain towels that are more suitable for small and medium-sized cities. Lihe Factory has stopped producing fancy towels and increased the weaving of twill bed sheets. Xinde Factory has changed to producing finished products according to the pattern of striped cloth from Daixin Company. Currently, the Department Store Company is also signing agreements with the cigarette industry to encourage small factories to form joint ventures, so that factories can produce according to sales needs, and the Department Store Company guarantees sales of the products. The toothbrush industry is also in the process of preparation.
	In addition, the ordering and processing by state-owned companies such as the Trust Company, Fur Company, and Egg Products Company have also played a significant role in supporting the production of related industries. For example, after the brick and tile industry started production at the end of March, most factories felt that capital turnover was difficult and were unable to pay wages. After the Trust Company and Tianjin Construction Company purchased 13 million bricks and tiles, production improved. In March and April, the Egg Products Company successively ordered 1,500 tons of egg products from Lixing, Hebei, Renli, Shengda and other factories, solving the production and sales problems of egg products. Since March, the Fur Company has ordered 15,000 square feet of carpet from the carpet industry, supporting the production of over 80 factories in March and April, and preventing over 400 workers from losing their jobs. Furthermore, the glass industry, machinery industry, and leather industry have also resumed normal production under the ordering and processing by various state departments.
	However, there are still some problems in the current purchase work.
	First of all, relevant departments such as the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the Commerce Bureau, and the Private Enterprise Bureau have failed to form a strong organization to widely unite the Department Store Company, the Trust Company, and other state-owned institutions. Therefore, in carrying out the work of purchasing, ordering, processing, and helping industrial production overcome the current difficulties, there is a lack of specific guidance and planned integration, resulting in the existing funds not being used more effectively. For example, in the Department Store Company's 14 billion yuan purchase plan in early April, red and white sugar and other groceries accounted for a large proportion, while the difficulties of the cigarette industry and others were not resolved more quickly.
	Secondly, in the Department Store Company's purchases, the vast majority of transactions were introduced by the Municipal Commerce Bureau and the Private Enterprise Bureau. Many of the factories selling goods took the opportunity to sell unsalable or substandard goods, or demanded prices higher than the market price. For example, Genlide Soap Factory and Jicheng Factory brought out inventory from before liberation to sell. The quality of goods sold by small private cigarette factories was too low. For example, the cigarettes from Meihua and Guansheng factories became moldy within ten days of delivery, and buyers returned the goods one after another. Some purchased goods even had to be sold by the Department Store Company at a loss, such as Xiaojinqian cigarettes.
	Thirdly, the purchase work is mostly limited to business transactions. State-owned trading companies have failed to strengthen the investigation and research of various industries and factories through this work, in order to lay a better foundation for future business development and guidance of private industrial production. Therefore, in the future, in addition to strengthening the organization, guidance, and inspection of purchase, ordering, and processing work, we should also strengthen the guidance of private industrial production based on the current production and sales situation of various products.

　　国营贸易公司收购成品委托加工
    津私营企业复工生产
    歇业现象基本停止市场渐形活跃
    【本报讯】天津市人民政府财经委员会为帮助津市私营工业度过自物价稳定以来的成品滞销、生产萎缩的困难，自三月下旬以来，曾大力组织各国营贸易公司收购各厂成品和委托加工，扶植生产，现已有了显著成绩。截至五月中旬止，津市各主要工业行业停工、歇业或倒闭的情况，已基本上停止，并转向复工生产。五月上旬一般物价较四月下旬下落百分之二·八八；且下落幅度亦较四月初大为缩小，而百货杂货类，还上升了百分之二·八二，市场成交现已渐形活跃。
    在各国营贸易公司收购成品、扶助生产方面：华北百货公司自四月一日至五月十日，四十天中，共收购公私营工厂产品，价值三百四十一亿余元，占该公司同一时期进货总额六百四十八亿的百分之五十以上，其中公营工厂产品约占百分之二十，私营工厂产品约百分之八十。发生交易的工厂共二百余家。私营企业中之主要行业，其成品收购的比例，以永利公司（碱面）为最多，占百分之三十，次为耀华玻璃厂占百分之十四·二，橡胶业占百分之十三，纸烟业占百分之十二·五，造纸业占百分之九，电料、文具、牙刷等行业占百分之七·五，织染、染整业占百分之七，余为化学染料业占百分之一·四，火柴业占百分之一·一，其他行业占百分之四·三。
    通过此次收购工作，对各行业的资金周转，恢复生产起了很大作用。首先是使很多工厂完成了公债缴款和交纳工商业税，且解决了因成品滞销而陷于资金周转不灵的困难，继续进行生产。如大宗收购了永利公司的碱面，大兴、义生等厂的袜子，利和、兴泰、生生等厂的毛巾，利民、辑华、福星等厂的肥皂，同昌、永昌等厂的牙刷，大华、永丰等厂的内外胎等，便使各该厂资金周转困难获得了解决。又如新成、大生、光华、天津等纸厂因成品滞销均已停工，经分别收购纸张四千余令而复工生产，瑞兴源记针织厂停工数日，经收购背心五千余打，永城内衣厂及同生工厂因积存成品陷入半停工状态，经收购衬衣三千六百打，布二百五十匹，使能继续开工。此外，收购万利、津华、永安等火柴厂成品一千箱，及烟草业成品一千一百余箱都解决了各该厂很多困难。
    其次是由于国营企业的加工、订货，给不少工厂解决了缺乏原料的困难。长兴成、泰和染厂等已形停工，经为百货公司染布三千五百匹便得以复工，又如文华文具工厂经订货后即开工生产。
    由于国营公司的收购，已使工业品价格走向合理。如胶鞋由平均每打价二十九万元，逐步升为三十四万元；硫化青经过收购，已逐步升至六十万至八十万元。截至目前止，主要工业品成本高、市价低的现象，已经改变，除纸张外按目前价格出售，一般都可保持不再赔钱。
    同时在收购工作中，对津市工业生产亦曾起了指导作用。不少工厂经百货公司对其成品规格、质量等加以指导，使能改进生产。如新泰、生生毛巾工厂，已改变花条毛巾为适合中小城市需要的素毛巾。利和工厂停止生产花色毛巾，增织斜纹床单。信德工厂改按大新公司条布样子制作成品，现百货公司更与纸烟业签定协议，鼓励小厂联营，使厂方按销路需要进行生产，产品由百货公司包销。牙刷业亦在酝酿中。
    此外，由于信托公司、皮毛公司、蛋品公司等国营公司的订货、加工，对扶助有关行业的生产亦有很大作用。如砖瓦业三月底开工后，一般工厂皆感资金周转困难，无力开付工资，经信托公司及天津建筑公司收购砖瓦一千三百万块后，已使生产好转。蛋品公司三、四月份，先后向利兴、河北、仁立、盛大等厂订购蛋品一千五百吨，解决了蛋品生产与销路问题。皮毛公司自三月至今，共向地毯业订购一万五千方尺地毯，支持了八十余家工厂三、四月份的生产，使四百余工人免于失业。再如料器业、机器业、制革业等亦都在国家各部门的定货、加工下，恢复了正常生产。
    但目前收购工作中尚存在一些问题。
    首先是各有关部门，如市财经委员会，商业局，私营企业局未能很好形成强有力的组织，广泛地将百货公司，信托公司及其它国营机构联合在一起。因此在进行收购、订货、加工等帮助工业生产度过目前困难的工作上，缺乏具体的指导和有计划的结合，致使现有资金未能更有效的运用。如四月初旬百货公司一百四十亿元的收购计划，红白糖等杂货所占比重很大，而纸烟业等困难未能更快的解决。
    其次，百货公司收购中，绝大部分是经过市商业局、私营企业局介绍成交的，其中不少售货工厂，表现了乘机推销背货次货，或要价高于市价的作法，如根利德肥皂工厂，集成工厂将解放前的存货拿来推销。小私营纸烟厂出售之货物质量太低，如美华、冠生烟厂纸烟，交货不及十日即行发霉，购者纷纷退货，甚至有些收购商品，百货公司不得不赔钱销出。如小金钱纸烟等。
    再次，收购工作中，多限于业务交易。国营贸易公司未能通过这一工作加强对各行业及工厂的调查研究，以便为今后的业务开展及对私营工业生产的指导打下更好的基础。因此，今后除应加强对收购、订货、加工等工作的组织、指导、检查外，并应根据目前各种产品的产销情况，加强对私营工业生产的指导。
