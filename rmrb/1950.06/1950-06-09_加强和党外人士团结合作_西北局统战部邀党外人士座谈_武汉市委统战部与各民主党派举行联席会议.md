Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch, Xi'an: The United Front Work Department of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited non-Party figures to a symposium on the 19th of last month. More than 200 people from various democratic parties and various circles attended. At the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, emphatically explained the importance and long-term nature of the people's democratic united front. He said: Since the liberation of Xi'an, the unity and cooperation between the Communist Party and non-Party figures have achieved certain results; however, there are also some shortcomings that cannot be ignored. He pointed out that some Communist Party members have long been accustomed to the methods of rural work and have developed a reluctance to learn and a conservatism that comes from taking pride in their revolutionary achievements. This is the root cause of the shortcomings. He demanded that Communist Party members in all work departments faithfully implement the Party's united front policy and work steadfastly with non-Party figures with a sincere attitude and the necessary principles. Wang Feng, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Northwest Bureau, made a report at the meeting on the spirit of the National United Front Conference. Yang Zilian and Yang Mingxuan of the Democratic League, and Pan Yuanquan, Director of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke successively, all expressing that unity and cooperation are two-sided. In his speech, Yang Mingxuan also emphatically reviewed that some democratic figures working in the government still have the idea of being guests. He hoped that everyone would take a master's attitude and actively do their own work well. After the meeting, the democratic figures who participated in the symposium generally believed that the meeting was very good and hoped that more such meetings would be held in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: According to the Hankou Yangtze River Daily, the United Front Work Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited the responsible persons and main cadres of various democratic parties in the city to hold a joint meeting of democratic parties on the first of this month. 119 representatives attended. At the meeting, Zhang Zhiyi, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, spoke about the spirit of the National United Front Work Conference of the Communist Party of China. Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech that the joint meeting of democratic parties is a fraternal meeting in the people's democratic family. In the future, we will strive to hold it once a month as much as possible, and this meeting is the beginning. The responsible persons of various democratic parties enthusiastically expressed their opinions at the meeting and introduced the work situation. Ma Zhemin, Director of the Hankou Branch of the Democratic League, reported on the work of the Democratic League in Wuhan after the city's liberation, and suggested that various democratic parties should have a planned division of labor and cooperation in their work. Hua Yuqing, convener of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association, Tang Wuyuan, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Geng Bozhao, member of the Preparatory Committee of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, all unanimously expressed that various democratic parties should further unite and cooperate.
